    A Splendid Sports Film
    ——Watching the Documentary "The Second National Games of the People's Republic of China"
    Li Menghua
    The large-scale color documentary "The Second National Games of the People's Republic of China," produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, has been released to audiences. This is a remarkably well-made sports documentary.
    The Second National Games, under the cordial care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country, was a great success and very exciting. Thousands of outstanding athletes from all over the country and all fronts carried forward the revolutionary spirit of "playing ball for the revolution, keeping the motherland in mind, and having the world in view," and engaged in a revolutionary competition of learning from, comparing with, catching up with, helping, and surpassing each other, making this Games a comprehensive harvest politically, ideologically, and technically.
    The film focuses on and summarizes the grand occasion and achievements of this Games, recording the solemn opening ceremony, the magnificent group callisthenics – "Ode to Revolution," the heated and intense competition, and the moving scenes inside and outside the stadium. It allows people to witness the entire Second National Games, which lasted for more than half a month, as if they were there, within an hour and a half.
    Through its depiction of the Second National Games, the film vividly embodies the characteristic of China's sports serving production labor and national defense construction. Encouraged by Chairman Mao's "Develop sports, enhance the people's physique" and the concept of people's war, the Chinese people are vigorously exercising for the revolution. The film introduces the moving scenes of Chinese sons and daughters soaring in the sky, swimming in lakes and seas, climbing high mountains, and practicing shooting, everywhere engaging in various sports activities and military training. They are training their will and physique to be unafraid of hardship and difficulty, capable of enduring great hardship and heavy labor, and mastering the skills to shoot accurately, operate effectively, connect smoothly, wade through water, and climb mountains. The film makes people strongly feel that the Chinese people are preparing themselves with high morale to strike at all enemies who dare to invade. Currently, U.S. imperialism is stepping up its aggression against South Vietnam, conducting frantic bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and carrying out war provocations against our country. U.S. imperialism has already expanded the flames of aggression to the entire Indochina. Chairman Mao said: "The imperialists are bullying us so much that we need to deal with them seriously." If U.S. imperialism insists on competing with us again, we will resolutely fight back to the end, defeat it, smash it, and bury it in the vast ocean of our country's universal military involvement. Therefore, we must strengthen war preparedness and actively carry out national defense sports activities to adapt to the needs of this situation.
    The film "The Second National Games of the People's Republic of China" prominently introduces the lofty aspirations and down-to-earth hard work of Chinese athletes striving to climb the peaks of world sports technology. Chinese outstanding athletes underwent arduous training in preparation for the National Games. Chen Jiaquan, Ni Zhiqin, Chen Jingkai, Li Shulan, Zheng Fengrong, and athletes in various sports have put in hard work to improve their scores by one centimeter or zero point one second. During the competition, they went all out, striving to be the best and striving to create excellent results. Guangdong athlete Ye Habo, broke the world record for the snatch in the lightest weight class in just fourteen minutes in one evening; People's Liberation Army archery athletes Li Shulan, Wang Xihua and Shi Guizhen, calmly and resolutely shot each arrow into the bullseye under difficult conditions with unfavorable weather and variable wind direction. They successively broke their own and the American athletes' world records in two events. Parachuting and shooting athletes also created world records.
    In this competition, Chinese athletes were single-mindedly focused on winning glory for the motherland and creating excellent results, rather than just winning a "ranking" or a "championship." Whether it was track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics, radio, marine models, shooting, various ball games, and athletes in each event, they all went all out to chase after each other, surpass each other, not being arrogant in victory, not discouraged in defeat, and constantly creating new achievements and new records with a revolutionary and strong will. Their spirit of meticulousness, courage, unwavering determination, and persistence to the end is well reflected in the film. Therefore, when people watch the documentary of the Second National Games, they cannot help but be inspired by the strong physique and youthful power of the young generation in our country. It encourages people to strive for victory, climb to the peak, and make outstanding achievements for the revolution in their own positions.
    The film highlights politics and highlights ideology. The scene of Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, and other Party and state leaders inspecting the athletes' ranks at the opening ceremony of the National Games once again reflects the concern of the Party and Chairman Mao for China's sports cause. This is the fundamental reason why China's sports have been able to achieve significant achievements in such a short period of time. Chinese athletes take the Chinese Table Tennis Team as an example, reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. On the competition field, they never forget to study Chairman's works, use them to examine their own thoughts, and strive to make themselves a red heart towards the Party, with lofty ambitions for the people.
    The color documentary of the Second National Games has achieved new achievements in both ideological and artistic terms, giving people political encouragement and spiritual strength. In terms of filming techniques, the twenty-three competition and performance events are arranged in an orderly manner, interspersed with ups and downs in a natural and coordinated way. Many shooting methods are able to break away from old conventions and create new ideas, giving people a fresh sense of liveliness, health, and beauty.
    This film is successful and worthy of congratulations. We believe that with the continuous development of China's culture and sports, we will definitely see more and better sports films.

    一部精采的体育片
    ——看纪录片《中华人民共和国第二届运动会》
    李梦华
    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂拍摄的大型彩色纪录片《中华人民共和国第二届运动会》，已经和观众见面了。这是一部拍得很出色的体育纪录片。
    第二届全国运动会在党中央和毛主席的亲切关怀下，在全国人民的热情支持下，开得很好，很精采。数千名来自全国各地，各条战线上的优秀选手们，发扬了“为革命而打球，胸怀祖国，放眼世界”的革命精神，展开了比学赶帮超的革命竞赛，使这届运动会获得了政治上、思想上、技术上全面的丰收。
    影片集中而概括地反映了这届运动会的盛况和成就，纪录了庄严的开幕式，雄伟的团体操——《革命赞歌》，热烈紧张的竞赛，以及赛场内外动人的情景。使人在一个半小时内，亲临其境地看到了历时半个多月的第二届全运会的全貌。
    影片通过对第二届全运会的描绘，鲜明地体现了我国体育运动为生产劳动和国防建设服务的特色。我国人民在毛主席“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”和人民战争思想的鼓舞下，意气风发地为革命而锻炼身体。影片介绍了中华儿女腾晴空，游湖海，攀高山，练射击，到处是从事各种各样体育活动、练兵习武的人们的动人场面。他们锻炼不畏艰险，不怕困难，能吃大苦，耐大劳的意志和体魄，掌握打得准、开得动、联得上，遇水涉水，逢山登山的过硬本领。影片使人们强烈地感受到中国人民斗志昂扬地作好一切准备，打击一切敢于来犯的敌人。目前，美帝国主义加紧侵略越南南方，对越南民主共和国进行疯狂轰炸，并对我国进行战争挑衅。美帝国主义已经把侵略战火扩大到整个印度支那。毛主席说：“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。”美帝国主义如果一定要与我们再次较量，我们则坚决应战奉陪到底，把它打垮、打烂，叫它葬身于我国全民皆兵的汪洋大海之中。因此，我们要加强战备，积极开展国防体育活动，以适应这一形势的需要。
    《中华人民共和国第二届运动会》影片突出地介绍了我国运动员，努力攀登世界运动技术高峰的雄心壮志和踏实苦干的精神。我国优秀运动员在迎接全运会的时候，进行了艰苦的锻炼。陈家全、倪志钦，陈镜开，李淑兰，郑凤荣，以及各项运动的选手们，为了提高一厘米，零点一秒的成绩，付出了辛勤的劳动。在比赛期间，他们鼓足干劲，力争上游，争取创造优良的成绩。广东选手叶浩波，在一个晚上，在十四分钟之内，连续打破了最轻量级抓举的世界纪录；解放军射箭选手李淑兰、王锡华和石桂珍，在天气不利，风向多变的困难条件下，镇静、坚毅地把每枝箭射向靶心，她们连续在两个项目中，打破了自己和美国选手所保持的世界纪录。跳伞和射击运动员也创造出了世界纪录。
    我国选手在这次竞赛中，一心为了祖国荣誉，创造优良的成绩，而不是为了仅仅夺取一个“名次”，夺取一个“锦标”。无论是田径，游泳，举重，体操，无线电，航海模型，射击，各项球类，以及各个项目中的运动员，都全力以赴地你追我赶，你超我越，胜不骄，败不馁，以革命的坚强意志，不断创造出了新的成绩和新的纪录。他们那种一丝不苟，勇往直前，毫不松懈，坚持到底的精神，在影片中得到很好的反映。因此，人们在观看第二届全运会纪录片的时候，不禁会被我国年青一代健壮的体魄，青春的力量所激奋，它鼓舞着人们去争取胜利，攀登高峰，在自己的岗位上，为革命作出出色的成绩。
    影片突出了政治、突出了思想。毛主席、刘主席以及党和国家其他领导人在全运会开幕式上亲临检阅了运动员队伍的场面，再次体现了党和毛主席对我国体育事业的关怀。这是我国体育运动所以能够在这样短的时间内，取得重大成就的根本原因。我国运动员以中国乒乓球队为榜样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事。他们在竞赛场上，也时刻不忘学习主席著作，用以检查自己的思想，努力使自己作到一颗红心向着党，胸怀壮志为人民。
    第二届全运会彩色纪录片，无论在思想性和艺术性上，都取得了新的成就，给人们以政治上的鼓舞，给人们以精神上的力量。在拍摄技巧上，把二十三个比赛和表演项目安排的井然有条，穿插得波澜起伏自然协调。许多镜头的拍摄方法，能脱窠臼，创新意，给人以生动活泼、健康美丽的新鲜感。
    这部影片是成功的，值得祝贺的。我们相信，随着我国文化和体育事业的不断发展，我们一定会看到更多更好的体育影片。
