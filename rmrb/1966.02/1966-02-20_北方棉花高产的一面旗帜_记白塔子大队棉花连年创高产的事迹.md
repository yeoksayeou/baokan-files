    A Banner of High Cotton Yield in the North
    — On the Continuous High Yields Achieved by the Baitazi Brigade

    In the northern cotton-growing regions, the natural conditions of the Baitazi Brigade are quite unfavorable, and the original yields were very low. In the past two years, they have adhered to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, learned from the spirit of Dazhai, taken the road of Dazhai, relied on their own efforts, and worked hard in all aspects of cotton production. As a result, cotton production has transformed from low yield to high yield, and high yield to even higher yield; at the same time, they have achieved self-sufficiency in grain with a surplus. This shows that the main factors determining high yields of grain and cotton are people, their revolutionary spirit, and their scientific attitude. The masses of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fully capable of transforming nature, overcoming adverse natural conditions, and creating outstanding production achievements.

    From the Baitazi Brigade, we can see the great potential of cotton production in the North. The planting area of ​​cotton in the North accounts for a large proportion of ​​China's total cotton planting area. If every unit in the northern cotton-growing area, like Baitazi, emphasizes politics, fully mobilizes people's enthusiasm and creativity, strives for high cotton yields, and strives for a double harvest of cotton and grain, the face of agricultural production in the North will be greatly changed, and greater contributions will be made to socialist construction.　Editor

    Can the cotton production in the northern cotton areas of our country achieve a great leap forward in a short period of time, changing from low yield to high yield, and high yield to even higher yield? The practice of the Baitazi Brigade of the Linglongta Commune in Jianchang County, Liaoning Province, north of the Great Wall, proves that as long as we take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, set the ambition of Dazhai, and take the road of Dazhai, this is entirely possible.

    The Baitazi Brigade only took two years to increase cotton production from 31 jin of ginned cotton per mu to 190 jin, an increase of more than five times, creating a miracle of large-scale cotton production increase.

    The Baitazi Brigade is located in western Liaoning Province, nestled in the deep mountain gullies surrounded by barren hills and ridges. Nine years out of ten are spring droughts, and the frost-free period is only over 150 days. In the past, not only was cotton production low, but grain production was also very low. The entire brigade of 179 households and more than 900 people needed the state to supply about 30,000 jin of grain and loans of more than 5,000 yuan every year.

    In 1964, the revolutionary spirit of the Dazhai people spread here, and this quiet mountain village became excited. Under the leadership of the brigade's Party branch, the members, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learned from the Dazhai people and took the Dazhai road, launching a vigorous revolution, which brought about earth-shaking changes in the production of the entire brigade. In this year, the brigade's 340 mu of cotton achieved a yield of 145 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 3.68 times compared with 1963, and removed the label of low cotton production in one fell swoop. In 1965, the brigade's 375 mu of cotton, despite suffering from severe drought, pests, diseases, and hail, achieved an average yield of 190 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 31 percent compared with 1964, and there were two production teams with an average yield of more than 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Among them, the Sixth Production Team's 56 mu of cotton averaged 222 jin of ginned cotton per mu; the Fourth Production Team's 94 mu of cotton averaged 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In two years, the entire brigade sold more than 115,800 jin of ginned cotton to the state.

    Along with the extraordinary leap forward in cotton production, grain production also achieved a relatively large increase. In 1964, the brigade's grain yield per mu reached 276 jin, an increase of more than 40 percent compared with 1963, transforming from a grain-deficient team to a grain-surplus team. Although 1965 suffered a severe drought, the grain yield per mu still reached 239 jin. In two years, more than 110,000 jin of surplus grain were sold to the state.

    With the large-scale increase in cotton and grain production, the collective economy continued to consolidate and grow stronger. In two years, not only were all loans repaid, but also 30,000 yuan of public accumulation was extracted, rubber-wheeled carts and mules and horses were added, and the collective production force was strengthened. The average income per member increased by more than one to two times compared to the past. Now, almost every household in the brigade has savings, and the members have built more than 420 new houses, and their lives have improved significantly.

    Setting the Ambition of Dazhai and Taking the Road of Dazhai

    In the spring of 1964, Wang Baishan, Secretary of the Linglongta Commune Party Committee, returned from visiting the Dazhai Brigade in Shanxi Province and introduced the heroic deeds and revolutionary spirit of the Dazhai people in transforming nature to the cadres of the commune and teams and some members. After listening, the cadres and the masses were greatly shocked, and they began to compare and examine themselves. Everyone felt deeply guilty: we have the same Party branch, the same cadres, and the same socialist construction, but others can lead the masses to transform nature and make such a great contribution to the country, while we still eat the state's grain every year and rely on state loans to engage in production. We are really letting down the country and the Party. Everyone began to realize that this was a major issue of implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction. Linking ideology to digging out the roots, the main reasons were that revolutionary ambition, revolutionary spirit, and the revolutionary thought of being loyal to the revolution and serving the people wholeheartedly were not as good as the Dazhai people. They unanimously expressed that they must resolutely remove the label of low grain and cotton production and produce more grain and cotton to support national construction and support the world revolution.

    Persisting in Scientific Experiment and Gaining Experience in Practice

    Although Baitazi has a history of cotton planting for more than fifty years, it is a history of low cotton production. Not only can't we find any experience of producing 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, but even the experience of 50 or 60 jin is also lacking.

    What to do without experience? The Party branch, with this question in mind, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's work "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" Chairman Mao said: "Correct ideas of people can only come from social practice, can only come from the three kinds of practice of social production struggle, class struggle and scientific experiment." This teaching gave them great inspiration, making them realize that to master the laws of high cotton production, they can only gain experience through scientific experiment in practice, and then promote it on a large scale. The Party branch decided that Hua Zhengxian, a member of the branch committee and director of the brigade's women's affairs, would be responsible for leading the brigade's scientific experiment work, with young people as the backbone and old peasants as advisors, to carry out scientific experiment activities.

    In the first year, Hua Zhengxian led seven young women, divided into two groups, to make revolution in the 15 mu of experimental fields. After the group was established, some people with conservative ideas sarcastically said: "A few young girls, who only know half a liter of words, can do any experiment?" Some people, after hearing these words, were afraid of being blamed for not doing well, so they wanted to quit. After Party branch secretary Li Rongshi learned about it, he encouraged them and said: "To make revolution, we must not bow our heads in the face of difficulties, and we must persist in the experiment. If we succeed, we will gain experience, and if we fail, we can learn lessons. As long as we dare to make revolution and dare to practice, we can do well." The Party branch secretary's words strengthened the experimental group's confidence.

    After sowing, the cotton seedlings happened to sprout poorly. The brigade's average seedling rate was 75 percent, while the experimental fields only had 50 percent. Some members of the experimental group wavered again. The Party branch organized them to study articles such as "Serve the People" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" to further encourage them to overcome their fear of difficulties. At this time, the commune convened a on-the-spot meeting on bud seedling transplanting. Hua Zhengxian participated in the meeting and told everyone about the method of bud seedling transplanting. They took a single breath, transplanted seedlings, and after seven days of hard work, basically achieved full seedlings. The Party branch timely organized cadres and members of various teams to visit and learn from the experimental fields, promoting a climax of seedling inspection and seedling transplanting in the brigade. The members worked for five or six days and basically realized full seedlings.

    In the process of scientific experiment and technological innovation, the cadres and members of this brigade were very modest in learning advanced experiences from other places. In the past two years, they have visited the national Dazhai-style typical unit—the Liujiazi Commune in Chaoyang County—seven times to learn experience, visited friendly neighboring communes ten times, and learned experience from Huang Yuanling, a Liaoning Provincial Agricultural Special Labor Model and cotton planting expert. Learn a little, use a little, start with the experimental fields, and then promote it in the brigade.

    "Guarantee Five Eights" and "Break Through Three Barriers"

    In learning from the experience of other places, this brigade paid great attention to learning and applying it flexibly, starting from reality, and creating its own experience. In the past two years, they have summarized and promoted a set of cotton production increase experiences of "Guarantee Five Eights and Break Through Three Barriers." "Guarantee Five Eights" means: ensure that 8,000 jin of base fertilizer are applied per mu, there are 8,000 cotton seedlings per mu, plow eight times, harrow eight times, and each cotton plant bears eight bolls. "Break Through Three Barriers" means: break through the barrier of drought-resistant sowing and seedling protection, the barrier of pruning and boll protection, and the barrier of topdressing, pest control, and harvest protection. In the past two years, these advanced technical measures have been promoted in the experimental fields, constantly opening up high-yield wonders.

    In 1965, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's teaching that "Mankind must constantly sum up experience, discover something, invent something, create something, and move forward," the cadres and members of the Baitazi Brigade summed up the experience of the large-scale leap forward in cotton production in 1964, overcame the idea of ​​"production reaching its peak" and complacency. In order to implement the scientific experiment results of "Guarantee Five Eights and Break Through Three Barriers" and seize higher cotton yields, they took the Dazhai people as an example and launched an unyielding struggle.

    "Guaranteeing Five Eights" first requires ensuring that 8,000 jin of base fertilizer are applied per mu of cotton field. However, when the spring plowing was about to begin, six of the seven production teams averaged only more than 6,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and it was too late to accumulate more fertilizer. What to do if there is insufficient manure? Some people advocated relying on the state to supply chemical fertilizer. The Party branch convened a meeting of Party members, League members, and poor and lower-middle peasants to let everyone discuss. Everyone said that engaging in high cotton production is to make more contributions to the country, and we should not rely on the state for everything, but should rely on our own efforts to overcome difficulties. Many members voluntarily contributed the good manure they had prepared for their private plots to the collective, achieving the requirement of applying 8,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu.

    After the difficulty of insufficient manure was resolved, severe drought threatened sowing. Of the brigade's 375 mu of cotton fields, only 120 mu were irrigated by diverting water, and the remaining 255 mu had to rely on people to carry water to irrigate and sow. In the fight against drought, the Party branch organized the members to study Chairman Mao's work "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" again. The members were full of fighting spirit and put forward the fighting slogan of "Ensure full seedlings without rain in spring, ensure a good harvest without rain in a year," taking the revolutionary spirit of the Dazhai people's "three battles against Wolf Nest Palm" as an example, relying on two "iron shoulders" to carry water, fight drought, and sow seeds. The members carried buckets weighing 70 or 80 jin, and each person had to walk a hundred and eighty li every day, but no one complained. They worked hard for eight days, irrigating more than 200 dan of water per mu, and finally completed the sowing plan on time, achieving victory in the fight against drought.

    After sowing began, there was another light snowfall, and the ground temperature dropped from 12 degrees Celsius to 5 or 6 degrees Celsius. In addition, the soil cover was relatively thick when sowing to resist drought, and after more than 20 days of sowing, the seedling rate was still less than 50 percent. In Baitazi, which has a short frost-free period, this is a fatal blow. However, the people of Baitazi, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, were not intimidated by the difficulties. The Party branch led the members to launch a timely battle to seize full seedlings. Female members went to the fields to dig soil to save seedlings, and male members continued to carry water to replant, finally reaching more than 90 percent seedlings, laying the foundation for achieving 8,000 seedlings per mu.

    Due to the late emergence of seedlings in the early stage, although 90 percent seedlings were achieved, the growing period was half a month later. In addition, the cotton encountered insect pests after seedling emergence, which seriously affected the growth of cotton. Many old poor peasants suggested to the brigade Party branch: we can't lie down and wait, and we should catch up in the later management if the seedlings emerge late. There is a saying here: "If cotton is plowed eight times, the cotton bolls will be like eggs, and the flowers will be like snowflakes." In two months, they plowed and harrowed again and again, finally achieving eight plowings and eight harrowings, and some teams even plowed more than ten times, making the soil loose and free of weeds, which was conducive to cotton growth. The brigade applied the first topdressing fertilizer before the cotton budded, and the second topdressing fertilizer at the beginning of flowering, ensuring more fruiting of the pre-volant bolls and increasing the boll weight. Pest control was even tighter, and they began to spray pesticides in the fields to control pests from the time they saw true leaves. When there were not enough sprayers, the members would rather not rest at noon and go to the fields to kill insects in the scorching sun, controlling the pests. This year, the brigade's 375 mu of cotton fields achieved an average of eight bolls per plant.

    Setting Examples, Helping the Backward, Comparing, Learning, Catching Up, and Helping Each Other

    In the struggle to seize high cotton yields, the Baitazi Brigade Party Branch implemented the revolutionization of leadership, set examples, helped the backward, and carried out a movement of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping each other, changing the generalized leadership method, which played an important role in achieving high cotton yields.

    Since 1964, while learning from advanced units such as Dazhai and Liujiazi outside the brigade, the brigade has established the Fourth Production Team, which has sufficient enthusiasm and advanced production, as a model within the brigade, and organized various production teams to learn from each other and help each other, catching up with the advanced. The brigade conducts inspections and evaluations by season, and promptly commends good people and good deeds through rooftop broadcasting and blackboards, forming a lively situation of you chasing me, I catching up with you, and common progress between teams and between people. In 1965, when cotton seedlings emerged, the seedlings of the Second Team were not as good as those of the Fourth Team. In order to catch up with the Fourth Team, the entire team mobilized more than 40 male and female members to carry out a surprise seedling transplanting. In order to help the Second Team catch up with themselves, the Fourth Team also took the initiative to send technicians and lend production tools such as carts and water tanks, providing support in manpower and materials. In the end, the Second Team went from less than 50 percent seedlings to 90 percent seedlings.

    In the movement of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping each other, the branch secretary and the brigade leader took the lead in squatting in the backward teams, participating in production, leading production, working hard and practically, which played a great role in changing the production outlook of the backward teams. After Party branch secretary Li Rongshi and brigade leader Hua Zeru went to the Sixth and Second backward teams respectively, they participated in labor and talked with poor and lower-middle peasant members to clarify the reasons for the backwardness of these two teams, mainly the disunity among cadres. After finding the reasons, they took class struggle as the key link, talked a lot about village history and family history, carried out recalling bitterness and thinking about sweetness, organized the study of Chairman Mao's works, solved the problem of disunity among cadres, made the members establish the idea of ​​planting cotton for the revolution, and improved their enthusiasm for production. In 1965, both teams created new records for high cotton yields.

    The deeds of the Baitazi Brigade in seizing high cotton yields with the spirit of Dazhai were commended at the recently held Fifth National Cotton Production Conference and were praised as a banner of high cotton yields in the northern cotton-growing area of ​​our country. After Li Rongshi, the brigade Party branch secretary who attended the meeting, conveyed the news to all the members, everyone was greatly encouraged and determined to strive for a greater leap forward in grain and cotton production in the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan. Now, all the brigade's cotton fields have been plowed, harrowed, and compacted, and more than 100 mu of flat land have been winter-irrigated, making preparations for preventing spring drought. The existing manure per mu of cotton field has reached about 8,000 jin. After the Spring Festival, the members will drive carts to pull soil to pad pens to accumulate fertilizer and improve the soil, making more sufficient preparations for increasing grain and cotton production.

    北方棉花高产的一面旗帜
    ——记白塔子大队棉花连年创高产的事迹
    在北方棉区中，白塔子大队的自然条件是相当不好的，原来的产量也是很低的。近两年来，他们坚持以毛泽东思想挂帅，学大寨精神，走大寨之路，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，在棉花生产的各个环节上狠下功夫，结果，棉花就由低产变高产，高产更高产；同时做到了粮食自给有余。这就说明，决定粮食、棉花高产的主要因素，是人，是人的革命精神和科学态度。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众，完全能够改天换地，战胜恶劣的自然条件，创造出优异的生产成绩。
    从白塔子大队，我们可以看到北方棉花生产的极大潜力。北方棉花播种面积，占我国棉花播种面积的很大比重。北方棉区的每个单位，都象白塔子那样，突出政治，充分调动人们的积极性、创造性，力争棉花高产，力争棉粮双丰收，就会使北方农业生产的面貌大为改观，就会对社会主义建设作出更大贡献。　编者
    我国北方棉区的棉花生产能不能在短时间内有个大的飞跃，由低产变高产、高产更高产？长城以北的辽宁省建昌县玲珑塔公社白塔子大队的实践证明：只要以毛泽东思想挂帅，立大寨之志，走大寨之路，这是完全可能做到的。
    白塔子大队仅用两年的时间，棉花产量就由亩产皮棉三十一斤跃到一百九十斤，增长了五倍多，创造了棉花大幅度增产的奇迹。
    白塔子大队在辽宁省西部，座落在荒山秃岭环抱的大山沟里。十年九春旱，无霜期只有一百五十多天。过去不仅棉花产量低，粮食产量也很低。全队一百七十九户、九百多口人，每年要国家供应三万斤左右口粮，贷款五千多元。
    一九六四年，大寨人的革命精神传到这里，这个沉寂的山村沸腾起来了。社员们在大队党支部领导下，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，学大寨人，走大寨路，轰轰烈烈闹革命，使全大队的生产面貌发生了翻天覆地的变化。这一年全大队三百四十亩棉花，亩产皮棉达到一百四十五斤，比一九六三年突增三点六八倍，一举摘掉了棉花低产帽子。一九六五年，全大队三百七十五亩棉花，在遭受严重干旱和虫、病、雹灾的情况下，平均亩产皮棉一百九十斤，比一九六四年增长了百分之三十一，并出现了两个平均亩产皮棉超过二百斤的生产队。其中，第六生产队种的五十六亩棉花，平均亩产皮棉二百二十二斤；第四生产队种的九十四亩棉花，平均亩产皮棉二百斤。全大队两年共向国家交售皮棉十一万五千八百多斤。
    与棉花生产特大跃进的同时，粮食产量也获得了较大幅度的增长。一九六四年全大队粮食亩产量达到二百七十六斤，比一九六三年增长百分之四十多，由缺粮队变成了余粮队。一九六五年虽然遭受了严重干旱，粮食亩产量仍然达到二百三十九斤。两年共向国家交售余粮十一万多斤。
    随着棉粮大幅度增产，集体经济不断巩固壮大。两年间不但全部还清了贷款，还提取了三万元公共积累，添置了胶轮大车和骡马，壮大了集体生产的力量。社员平均每人收入比过去提高一倍多到两倍。现在全大队几乎户户有存款，社员盖新房四百二十多间，生活显著改善。
    立大寨之志，走大寨之路
    一九六四年春天，玲珑塔公社党委书记王柏山从山西省参观大寨大队回来，向社队干部和部分社员介绍了大寨人改天换地的英雄事迹和革命精神。干部和群众听后受到很大震动，便边对照，边检查。大家深深感到内疚：都是一样的党支部，一样的干部，一样搞社会主义建设，人家能领导群众改天换地，对国家贡献那么大，我们还年年吃国家粮食，靠国家贷款搞生产，真是对不起国家，对不起党。大家开始认识到，这是一个贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的大问题。联系思想挖根子，主要是革命志气、革命精神和忠心耿耿为革命、全心全意为人民服务的革命思想不如大寨人。他们一致表示，一定要坚决摘掉粮棉低产的帽子，多产粮棉支援国家建设，支援世界革命。
    坚持科学实验，在实践中取得经验
    白塔子虽然有五十多年的植棉历史，但是这是一部棉花低产的历史。从这里不仅找不到亩产百斤皮棉的经验，连五六十斤的经验也没有。
    没有经验怎么办？党支部带着这个问题，组织大家学习了毛主席著作《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》毛主席说：“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。”这一教导给他们很大的启示，使他们认识到，要掌握棉花高产规律，只能通过科学实验，在实践中取得经验，然后再大面积推广。党支部决定由支部委员、大队妇女主任华正贤负责领导全大队的科学实验工作，以青年为骨干，请老农当参谋，开展科学实验活动。
    第一年，华正贤领导七个年轻姑娘，分成两个小组，在十五亩试验田上闹革命。小组成立后，一些有保守思想的人讽刺说：“几个毛丫头，斗大的字只认识半升，还能搞什么试验呢？”有的人听了这些话，怕搞不好受埋怨，就想不干了。党支部书记李荣实知道以后，勉励她们说：“要革命，在困难面前就不能低头，一定要坚持试验。成功了我们得到经验，失败了可以吸取教训。只要敢于革命，勇于实践，就能搞好。”支部书记的这番话，使试验小组坚定了信心。
    播种后，棉苗偏偏出得不好。全大队平均七成半苗，试验田里只有五成苗。试验小组的一些成员又动摇了。党支部又组织她们学习《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》等文章，进一步鼓励她们克服畏难情绪。正在这时候，公社召开了芽苗移栽现场会。华正贤参加会议回来，把芽苗移栽的办法告诉了大家。她们就一鼓作气，移栽补苗，经过七天奋战，基本上达到了全苗。党支部及时组织各队干部和社员到试验田参观学习，推动全大队掀起了查苗补苗的高潮。社员们干了五六天，基本上实现了全苗。
    在科学实验和技术改革过程中，这个大队的干部和社员十分虚心学习外地的先进经验。近两年，他们曾经七去全国大寨式典型单位——朝阳县六家子公社取经，十访友邻公社，向辽宁省农业特等劳动模范、植棉能手黄元龄学习经验。学一点，用一点，试验田先行，然后在全大队推广。
    “保五八”和“闯三关”
    在学习外地经验中，这个大队很注意活学活用，从实际出发，创造自己的经验。两年来，总结推行了一套“保五八，闯三关”的棉花增产经验。“保五八”是：保证每亩施底肥八千斤，每亩有棉苗八千棵，铲八遍，趟八遍，每棵棉株结八个桃。“闯三关”是：闯过抗旱播种保苗关，整枝保桃关，追肥、除虫保收关。两年来，在试验田里推行这些先进技术措施，不断开放出高产的奇花。
    一九六五年，白塔子大队的干部和社员，在毛主席教导的“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的思想指导下，总结了一九六四年棉花生产大幅度跃进的经验，克服了“增产到顶”思想和自满松劲情绪。为了贯彻执行“保五八，闯三关”的科学实验成果，夺取更高的棉花产量，他们以大寨人为榜样，展开了不屈不挠的斗争。
      “保五八”首先要保证每亩棉田施底肥八千斤。然而，到春耕快开始的时候，七个生产队有六个队平均每亩底肥不过六千多斤，现积肥已经赶不上了。粪肥不足怎么办？有人主张依靠国家供应化肥。党支部召开党团员和贫农下中农社员会议，让大家讨论。大家都说，搞棉花高产是为了给国家多做出贡献，不应该事事依靠国家，应该自力更生克服困难。许多社员主动把准备上自留地的好粪投给集体，实现了每亩地施八千斤底肥的要求。
    粪肥不足的困难解决以后，严重的干旱威胁着播种。全大队三百七十五亩棉田，只有一百二十亩引水进行了灌溉，其余二百五十五亩都得靠人挑水座水播种。在抗旱斗争中，党支部组织社员再次学习了毛主席著作《愚公移山》。社员们斗志昂扬，提出“一春无雨保全苗，一年无雨保丰收”的战斗口号，以大寨人“三战狼窝掌”的革命精神为榜样，凭着两个“铁肩膀”挑水抗旱播种。社员们挑着七八十斤重的水桶，每人每天要走百八十里路，谁也不叫苦。他们大干八天，每亩浇了二百多担水，终于按时完成了播种计划，取得了抗旱斗争的胜利。
    播种开始以后又下了一场小雪，地温从摄氏十二度下降到五六度，加上抗旱播种覆土较厚，播完种二十多天还未出到五成苗。在无霜期短的白塔子，这是致命的打击。但是，以毛泽东思想武装起来的白塔子人，并没有被困难吓倒。党支部领导社员及时地展开了争夺全苗的战斗。女社员们纷纷下地扒土救苗，男社员继续挑水补种，终于达到了九成苗以上，为实现每亩地保八千棵苗打下了基础。
    由于前期出苗晚，虽然达到了九成苗，生长期却晚了半个多月，加上棉花出苗以后就遇到虫害，严重地影响棉花的生长。许多老贫农向大队党支部建议：不能躺下等着，苗出晚了就在后期管理中赶上去。这里有个谚语：“棉花铲八遍，棉桃赛鸡蛋，开花象雪片。”他们在两个月的时间里，铲趟一遍接着一遍，终于做到了八铲八趟，有的队还铲了十多遍，做到土质松软，没有杂草，有利于棉花生长。全大队在棉花现蕾前就追了头遍肥，在初花期又追了第二遍，保证了多结伏前桃和增加桃重。在除虫上抓得更紧，从见真叶就开始在地里打药治虫。喷雾器不够用，社员们宁肯中午不休息，冒着烈日下地灭虫，控制了虫害。这年，全大队三百七十五亩棉田实现了平均每棵保八个桃的要求。
      树标兵、帮后进，比学赶帮超
    在夺取棉花高产的斗争中，白塔子大队党支部实行领导革命化，树标兵，帮后进，开展比学赶帮超运动，改变一般化的领导方法，对实现棉花高产起了重要作用。
    从一九六四年以来，这个大队在外学大寨、学六家子等先进单位的同时，在大队内部树立了社员干劲足、生产先进的第四生产队为样板，组织各生产队互学互帮，赶超先进。大队按季节进行检查评比，及时通过屋顶广播和黑板报表扬好人好事，使队与队、人与人之间形成了你追我赶、共同跃进的生动局面。一九六五年棉花出苗时，第二队的棉苗不如四队多，为了赶上第四队，全队出动四十多名男女社员突击补苗。第四队为了帮助第二队赶上自己，也主动派出技术员，借给大车、水柜等生产工具，在人力物力上给以支援，最后使第二队由不到五成苗争到了九成苗。
    在比学赶帮超活动中，支部书记和大队长带头到后进队去蹲点扎根，参加生产，领导生产，苦干实干，对改变后进队的生产面貌起了很大作用。党支部书记李荣实和大队长华泽儒分别到第六、第二两个后进队蹲点以后，通过参加劳动，和贫农下中农社员谈心等一系列工作，搞清了这两队生产落后的原因，主要是干部之间不团结。找到了原因以后，他们就以阶级斗争为纲，大讲村史、家史，进行忆苦思甜，组织学习毛主席著作，解决了干部之间不团结的问题，使社员树立了为革命种棉的思想，提高了生产积极性。一九六五年，这两个队都创造了新的棉花高产纪录。
    白塔子大队以大寨精神夺取棉花高产的事迹，在最近召开的全国第五次棉花生产会议上受到了表扬，被誉为我国北方棉区棉花高产的一面旗帜。出席会议的大队党支部书记李荣实回来向全体社员传达后，大家受到了极大鼓舞，决心争取在第三个五年计划的第一年使粮棉生产有个更大的跃进。现在全大队的棉田已经全部进行了翻耕、耙压，并有一百多亩平地进行了冬灌，为预防春旱做好了准备。每亩棉田现有粪肥已达到八千斤左右。春节一过，社员们就出车拉土垫圈积肥，改良土壤，为粮棉增产进行更充分的准备。
