    To the comrades, we recommend this manuscript because it relatively systematically introduces the vivid process of the revolutionary development of a county party committee.
    The revolutionization of the Xiangyuan County Party Committee is a profound ideological revolution, and also an ideological revolution from top to bottom. This is because the County Party Committee was determined to revolutionize, take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, boldly mobilize the masses, bravely admit backwardness, and dare to take responsibility, unfolding principled criticism and self-criticism within the County Party Committee. In this way, they have taken a big step forward on the road to revolutionization.
    The bolded words inserted in the text are added by us. Editor
    Recently, the Xiangyuan County Party Committee in Shanxi Province has vigorously grasped ideological revolutionization, powerfully promoting the great mass struggle to manage fields, control water, and transform the land.
    Is there a problem, or is there no problem?
    What is the situation of Xiangyuan County's work in recent years? The general understanding of the County Party Committee is: the work has improved.
    Achievements should be affirmed. Are there any problems? Opinions vary. Some say there are, but they are all things from a few years ago; some say there are also some now, but they are very small, and can be slowly changed. The members of the Standing Committee exchanged opinions and felt that not seeing the problems in the course of advancement is the beginning of backwardness. Therefore, they systematically summarized the work of recent years.
    After concrete analysis, everyone discovered that Xiangyuan County's agricultural production has "three nots": unstable, not high, not complete. The first two "nots" refer to the yield of the land. In good years, it yields 120 million jin of grain, while in the worst years, it only yields 80 million jin, a difference of 40 million jin, which is unstable. Even if we calculate with the total output of 120 million jin in good years, the average yield per mu is only about 200 jin, which is not high. The last "not" refers to the incompleteness of product varieties. The first two "nots" among the "three nots" are due to "three lacks": lack of soil, lack of water, lack of fertilizer. Xiangyuan County has thick soil layers, but the problem is that the arable layer is thin, and each year's autumn plowing is only a few inches deep. The lack of water is not that there is no water, but that the water cannot be used. Corn stalks, which could be used as fertilizer, are burned for fuel, which is a waste. (Everything must be analyzed concretely, which is to use the dialectical method of "one divides into two," and only in this way can the crux of the problem be found.)
      Is it a problem of the County Party Committee's leadership, or is it a problem of the masses' awareness?
    How are the "three lacks" formed? Some say it is because the masses' awareness is not high and their labor attitude is not good. Some say it is because the cadres below do not listen and are not active in their work. Others say it is because the work was too backward in previous years. The Standing Committee believes that while there are problems at the lower levels, it is wrong to push everything onto the basic-level cadres and the broad masses. Therefore, they organized everyone to seriously study Chairman Mao's relevant expositions and the *People's Daily*'s discussion on the revolutionization of county party committees. On the basis of improving ideological understanding, they recalled the struggle practice of the past two years.
    Two things are very convincing: one is that leading cadres did not take the lead in staying at selected points in the past, and everyone could not stay down. Later, the secretary went down, the committee members went down, and soon nearly half of the cadres in the county went down. The other is learning from Dazhai. Because the leading cadres did not truly believe and sincerely admire Dazhai, they shouted weakly, learned insincerely, and worked without energy. Last year, at the Four-Level Cadre Expansion Conference in March, the County Party Committee took the lead in revolutionization, taking Chairman Mao's works as the guide and Dazhai as the example, and a mass movement combining studying Chairman Mao's works and learning from Dazhai quickly unfolded throughout the county. From these vivid facts, the entire County Party Committee deeply realized that: there is only backward leadership, no backward masses; as long as the cadres set an example, the masses will follow. (Daring to expose one's own shortcomings and bravely admitting one's backwardness is the starting point for progress.)
  Is it a question of whether or not to dare to make revolution, or is it a question of whether the method is right?
    It is a problem of the County Party Committee's leadership. But what exactly is the problem of leadership?
    The members of the County Party Committee began self-examination with revolutionary spirit. Some said they had dependent thoughts, some said they were lying on the "old" character, some said they had poor work ability, but the vast majority of comrades mentioned the word "fear." For example: they fear making mistakes when making decisions; they know that something should be done and can be done well, but they will not do it if the secretary does not nod; they are afraid of offending each other among comrades, and they will not criticize and point out what is wrong, valuing harmony; they are also afraid of being criticized by others for their own mistakes; they are afraid of difficulties when they have tasks, they are listless when accepting them, and they are slow in action when completing them; they are afraid of hardship when going down to the countryside to stay at selected points; they are afraid of not achieving new results when going to advanced teams, and they are afraid of not changing the old appearance when going to backward teams. Therefore, some people say, "I am following others to make revolution, watching others' expressions to make revolution; when others take a step, I follow one step." Some say, "I am afraid of the front and afraid of the back, and sometimes I don't even want to follow." (Boldly exposing thoughts is a concrete manifestation of carrying forward the revolutionary spirit.)
    Where does fear come from? Some say it is mainly a problem of understanding, a problem of method, a poor summary of historical experience and lessons, and an unclear demarcation of right and wrong. Some say it is mainly a problem of ideological awareness, with a "self" behind the word "fear." At this time, everyone studied Chairman Mao's relevant articles together, and studied the *People's Daily*'s editorials, "Fear Neither Hardship Nor Death" and "All Work is For the Revolution." Everyone realized that although there are also problems in methods and understanding, the root cause of fear is mainly the question of the consciousness of whether or not to dare to make revolution. After clarifying the truth, everyone made a second self-examination, and some comrades even automatically made three self-examinations, while simultaneously conducting analysis and criticism.
          Is it open-door revolution, or is it closed-door revolution?
    Immediately after the County Party Committee meeting, a three-level cadre meeting was held throughout the county. At that time, there were two plans. That is, whether the revolutionization of the County Party Committee should be brought to the broad grassroots cadres to be revolutionized, whether it should be closed-door revolution or open-door revolution, revolution to the end? (This is a major matter, related to whether the revolutionization of the County Party Committee can be thoroughly realized.) Some comrades thought that the problems of the County Party Committee had been solved, and the problem now was to arrange production and help the lower levels make revolution. However, the vast majority of comrades believed that to make revolution, we must carry out an open-door revolution and revolutionize to the end, even if the three-level cadre meeting only solves the problem of the revolutionization of the County Party Committee. At this time, the County Party Committee also studied Chairman Mao's relevant expositions on carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Chairman Mao's paragraph was extremely enlightening to everyone: "Because we serve the people, we are not afraid of others criticizing us if we have shortcomings. No matter who it is, anyone can point it out to us. As long as you are right, we will correct it." Everyone said, "What's wrong with open-door revolution? It's nothing more than a little more criticism, which is nothing to be afraid of." At the same time, everyone also discussed the benefits of open-door revolution, that is, it can dig deeply, expose thoroughly, reform ruthlessly, and also closely connect the relations between the upper and lower levels, the relations between the Party and the masses, and promote the revolutionization of the lower levels. Therefore, it was unanimously decided to have an open-door revolution on the basis of the County Party Committee's self-revolution. Moreover, it was decided that the secretary and members of the County Party Committee should make public self-examinations. In order to obtain the help of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants for the County Party Committee's revolution, more than 200 representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants were also invited to participate in the meeting.
    Is it enough to have self-examination, or is it also necessary to have criticism from bottom to top?
    At the three-level cadre meeting, the comrades of the County Party Committee generally took the lead in making self-examinations, inviting the nearly two thousand comrades present to make criticisms. Some comrades had concerns. One fear (fear that the criticism below would be excessive), two top (pushing back the opinions from below), making their faces red. (How to treat criticism is a test for a revolutionary.) The comrades below also had concerns, one fear that the County Party Committee's self-examination was just a show, and then they would let themselves be examined, and two fear that it would be difficult to handle affairs in the future if they gave opinions to the leading comrades. (The responsibility of the leadership lies in using actions and facts to dispel the concerns of the masses.) Therefore, the opinions raised on the first day were mostly superficial, general, and fragmented opinions. The County Party Committee studied the emotions of both the upper and lower levels, and decided to study Chairman Mao's relevant works with the problems, and arm the minds of the broad cadres with Mao Zedong Thought; at the same time, it expressed the County Party Committee's sincere acceptance of everyone's opinions.
    Chairman Mao's works were effective as soon as they were studied, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the participating comrades rose. Zhao Liubao, director of the Poor Peasants' Association of Chengdi Brigade, criticized, "The current peasants are different from the past. They don't rely on the sky, and they don't rely on the land, they rely on the Party. But the County Party Committee doesn't raise the banner, how can everyone follow?" Various discussion groups in Chengguan Commune proposed, "The County Party Committee only grasped two of the three great revolutionary movements, and dropped scientific experimentation." Comrades from Xialiang Commune recalled, "During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the political commissar and the county head ate together, slept together, and moved together with us. Now, you don't go up the mountains." Among these criticisms, there were also many that named names.
    The secretary of the County Party Committee made a second self-examination, and also expressed his willingness to make a third and fourth self-examination. At this time, the comrades below were very excited, and everyone poured out their hearts. Within four days, more than 3,100 criticisms were made.
    On the fourth day, the comrades below said: "We have said everything, let us make self-examinations." The County Party Committee did not agree, but instead gave everyone two topics: one was to look at the bad consequences caused in grassroots work from the problems, shortcomings, and errors existing in the County Party Committee's leadership; the other was to look at the seriousness of the problems existing in the County Party Committee's leadership from the problems and harms existing in grassroots work, calling on everyone to dig out the roots and make criticisms. This made the broad grassroots cadres see the County Party Committee's determination to revolutionize even more. On the one hand, they helped the County Party Committee to make serious criticisms, and on the other hand, they consciously and deeply examined and criticized their own shortcomings and problems in their thinking, style, and work. In this way, a great ideological revolution from top to bottom and from bottom to top was truly formed. Many comrades said, "In the past, there were shortcomings in our work, not only the responsibility of the County Party Committee, but we didn't generate heat either. How can we only criticize the County Party Committee?" "Revolutionization requires revolution from both top and bottom. Since the County Party Committee has such a great determination, we will never lag behind."
    After the three-level cadre meeting ended, each commune and each production brigade mostly followed the County Party Committee's method to carry out ideological revolutionization, mobilizing the masses to expose problems in their work. After doing so, everyone generally felt that: the relations between the Party and the masses have become closer, the upper and lower levels are of one mind, and the enthusiasm for work and labor has increased.
    The ideological revolutionization movement throughout Xiangyuan County has greatly mobilized the forces and positive factors in all aspects, thereby setting off a new upsurge in farmland capital construction. More than 27,000 laborers in the county are on the battlefield, and nearly 40,000 mu of Dazhai fields and garden fields have been built.

    襄垣县委自上而下深入进行思想革命
    敢于发动群众　勇于承认落后
    向同志们推荐这篇稿件，因为它比较系统地介绍了一个县委革命化的发展的生动过程。
    襄垣县委的革命化是一次深刻的思想革命，同时也是一次自上而下的思想革命。这是因为县委下决心革命化，用毛泽东思想挂帅，放手发动群众，勇于承认落后，敢于承担责任，在县委中展开了原则性的批评和自我批评，这样，他们就在革命化的道路上向前跨进了一大步。
    插在文中的黑体字是我们加的。　编者
    最近，山西襄垣县委狠抓思想革命化，有力地推动了群众性治田治水、改天换地的伟大斗争。
    是有问题，还是没问题？
    襄垣县近几年的工作情况如何？县委普遍的认识是：工作是上来了。
    成绩应当肯定。有没有问题呢？说法不一。有的说有，但都是前几年的事情；有的说现在也有，可是很小，慢慢改就行了。常委们交换意见，觉得看不到前进当中的问题，就是落后的开始。因此，系统地总结了近几年来的工作。
    一经具体分析，大家发现，襄垣县的农业生产有“三不”：不稳，不高，不全。前两“不”是说土地的产量，好年景收一亿二千万斤粮食，最差年景仅收八千万斤，上下相差四千万斤，这是不稳。就以好年景总产一亿二千万斤算，平均亩产也不过二百来斤，这是不高。后一“不”，是指产品品种不全。而“三不”中的前“两不”，则是由于“三缺”：缺土、缺水、缺肥。襄垣县土层厚，问题是活土层薄，每年秋耕不过几寸深。缺水也不是没水，是有水用不上。可作肥源的玉茭秸秆烘了火，实在是浪费。（凡事都要具体分析，这就是运用“一分为二”的辩证方法，也只有如此，才能找到问题的症结）
      是县委领导问题，还是群众觉悟问题？
    “三缺”是怎样形成的呢？有的说，是群众觉悟不高，劳动态度不好。有的说，是下边干部不听话、工作不积极。还有的说，是前几年工作过于落后。常委认为，下面固然有下边的问题，但一古脑儿推到基层干部、广大群众身上，是错误的。为此，组织大家认真学了毛主席有关的论述，学了《人民日报》关于县委革命化问题的讨论。在思想水平提高的基础上，回忆了近两年的斗争实践。
    有两件事情是很有说服力的：一件是干部蹲点，以前领导干部不带头，大家也都蹲不下去。后来，书记下去了，委员下去了，于是全县近半数的干部很快就下去了。另一件是学大寨，因为领导干部不是真信真服，所以喊得不力，学得不诚，干的没劲。去年三月四级扩干会，县委带头革命化，以毛主席的著作为纲，大寨为样，一个大学毛主席著作和大学大寨相结合的群众性运动，便迅速在全县范围内开展起来了。从这些活生生的事实中，全体县委深深认识到：只有落后的领导，没有落后的群众，只要干部摆下样，群众就会跟着上。（敢于揭自己的底，勇于承认自己落后，这是前进的起点）
  是敢不敢革命的问题，还是方法对不对的问题？
    是县委领导问题。但，是领导的什么问题呢？
    县委成员以革命精神开始自我检查。有说自己有依赖思想的，有说自己躺在“老”字上的，有说自己工作能力差的，但绝大多数同志，都说到个“怕”字。比如：决定问题怕错，明知那一件事该做，也可以做好，但书记不点头不做；同志之间怕惹，明知不对，也不去批评指出，以和为贵；自己有了错误，也怕别人批评，有了任务怕难，接受时精神萎靡不振，完成时行动慢慢腾腾；下乡蹲点怕苦，到先进队，怕搞不出新成绩，到后进队，怕改变不了老面貌。因此，有人说，我是跟着别人革命，看别人眼色革命，人家走一步，自己跟一步。有的说，我是前也怕，后也怕，有时候跟也不想跟。（大胆暴露思想，这正是发扬革命精神的具体体现）
    怕从何来？有人说，主要是认识问题，方法问题，历史经验教训总结得不好，正确错误界限划得不清。有的说，主要是思想意识问题，“怕”字背后有一个“我”字。这时，大家又一起学了毛主席有关文章，学了《人民日报》的《一不怕苦二不怕死》、《一切工作都是为了革命》的社论。大家认识到，虽然方法上、认识上也有问题，但怕的根源，主要是敢不敢革命的意识问题。道理弄清以后，大家又作了第二次自我检查，有的同志还自动检查了三次，同时进行了分析批判。
          是开门革命，还是关门革命？
    县委会议之后，紧接着就开全县三级干部会。当时有两种方案。即县委革命化要不要拿到广大基层干部面前来革，是关住门革一下拉倒呢，还是开门革，革到底？（事关重大，关系到县委革命化能否彻底实现）有些同志以为，县委的问题已经解决了，现在的问题是布置生产，帮助下面革命。而绝大多数同志认为，要革命，就要开门革，革到底，三级干部会议那怕只解决一个县委革命化问题也好。这时，县委又学习了毛主席有关开展批评和自我批评的论述，毛主席这一段话，对大家启发极大：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”大家说，开门革命有什么不好呢？无非是多一点批评，这没有什么可怕。同时，大家还讨论了开门革命的好处，这就是能挖得深，揭得透，改得狠，还能密切上下关系，党群关系，促进下面的革命化。因此，一致决定在县委会自我革命的基础上，再来个开门革命。而且决定，县委书记和委员当众检查。为了使县委的革命得到广大贫下中农的帮助，还邀请了二百多名贫下中农代表参加会议。
    是只要自我检查，还是也要自下而上批评？
    在三级干部会上，县委同志普遍带头进行了检查，请到会的近二千位同志提出批评。一些同志产生了顾虑。他们一怕（怕下面批评过火），二顶（把下面的批评意见顶回去），弄得面红耳赤。（如何对待批评，是对一个革命者的考验）下面的同志，也有顾虑，一怕县委检查只是摆个样子，然后就让自己检查，二怕给领导同志提了意见，以后不好办事。（领导的责任就在于用行动和事实解除群众的顾虑）因此，头一天提上来的意见，大都是一些表面的、一般的、零碎的意见。县委研究了上下两方面的情绪，决定带着问题，学毛主席有关著作，用毛泽东思想武装广大干部的头脑；同时表示县委诚恳接受大家的意见。
    主席著作一学就灵，与会同志革命的积极性起来了。城底大队贫协主任赵留保批评说：“现在的庄稼人和过去不一样啦，一不靠天，二不靠地，就是靠党。可县委不举帅旗，大伙怎么跟上来哩。”城关公社各个讨论小组提出：“三大革命运动，县委只抓了两个，把个科学实验丢了。”下良公社的同志回忆说：“抗日战争时期，政委、县长和咱吃在一块，睡在一块，动在一块。现在哩，你们却不上山了。”在这些批评意见中，还有不少是指名道姓的。
    县委书记进行了第二次检查，还表示准备作第三次、第四次检查。这时候，下面同志激动得很，人人尽吐肺腑之言。四天之内，共提出批评意见三千一百多条。
    到四天头上，下边的同志说：话说尽了，让我们作检查吧。县委没有同意，而是给大伙出了两个题目：一个是从县委领导存在的问题与缺点、错误，看在基层工作中造成了什么恶果；另一个是从基层工作中存在的问题与危害，看县委领导所存在的问题的严重性，号召大家挖根子，作批判。这就使广大基层干部更加看到了县委革命化的决心，一方面帮助县委进行认真的批判，同时也自觉地、深刻地检查和批判了自己思想上、作风上、工作上的缺点和问题。如此，就真正形成了一次自上而下又自下而上的思想大革命。许多同志说：“过去工作有缺点，不光是县委的责任，我们也没发热呀，咋能光批评县委。”“革命化上下都要革，县委既然有这么大的决心，我们决不落后。”
    三级干部会议结束以后，各公社、各生产大队大都仿照县委的办法，进行思想革命化，发动群众揭发工作中的问题。而这样做了之后，大家普遍感到：党群关系密切了，上级下级一心了，工作劳动劲大了。
    襄垣全县上下的思想革命化运动，极大地调动了各方面的力量与积极因素，从而掀起了一个农田基本建设新高潮。全县有两万七千多劳力上阵，已建成大寨田、园田近四万亩。
