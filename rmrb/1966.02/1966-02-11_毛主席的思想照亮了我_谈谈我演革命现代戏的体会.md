    Mao Zedong's Thought Illuminates Me
    ——My Experience in Performing Revolutionary Modern Operas
    Chang Xiangyu
    I have been performing operas for over thirty years, and the path I have taken has been quite tortuous. In traditional operas, I played Qingyi, Huadan, and Guimendan roles. I liked to play characters with a bold spirit, who were brave and unyielding in the face of powerful enemies, such as Mu Guiying and Hua Mulan. I also liked to play characters like Hong Niang. But I never broke free from the circle of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. After liberation, I began to read Chairman Mao's works, which greatly enlightened me. Especially after reading "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," I understood that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and I clarified the direction for literary and art workers. But this was only a new understanding in theory. How to combine it with my artistic creation, how to use Mao Zedong's thought as a weapon to transform my subjective world, eliminate the influence of old ideas and old consciousness, and shift my foothold to the direction of the proletariat, had not been completely resolved.
    In 1953, I went to Korea to perform for the most beloved people—the Volunteer Army. Then I went to factories, mines, and the countryside to perform for workers and peasants, and I saw many advanced individuals and encountered many heroic deeds that were worth singing about. At that time, I had a desire: How wonderful it would be if I could perform heroic women of the socialist era on stage! At this time, I re-read Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," which stated: "If you are a bourgeois writer or artist, you will praise the bourgeoisie and not the proletariat; if you are a proletarian writer or artist, you will praise the proletariat and the working people and not the bourgeoisie." After reading these words, I had a very intense ideological struggle: on the one hand, I was determined to try to perform modern operas, but on the other hand, I was afraid of not performing well and being laughed at. In 1956, I performed my first modern opera, "Zhanghe Bay." In this opera, I played a young girl. Although my enthusiasm was high, because I had no experience of that life and was unfamiliar with rural girls, I performed very unsuccessfully. I thought, I should just go back to my old path and perform my Mu Guiying, Hua Mulan, and Hong Niang! But when I continued to read Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" later, my heart always pounded, as if I was in the wrong. My desire to perform modern operas revived. In 1957, we rehearsed the revolutionary historical drama "Mother," in which I played the mother, but I didn't perform well. In 1958, with the help of the Party and comrades, I gathered my courage again and re-rehearsed a modern opera. I played the role of Aunt Shuanbao in "Chaoyang Ditch." Because I had summarized the experiences and lessons of the previous two times, and because I had some preliminary real life experience, especially because I had studied Mao Zedong's works more than before, this opera was somewhat better than the previous two. But the difficulties I encountered were also considerable: the old postures and old performance routines could not be used, and there was no new set. I didn't know how to use entrances, stage steps, hand gestures, and eye expressions appropriately. In particular, I hadn't put in the effort in terms of thought, life experience, and skills, which brought me a lot of ideological distress.
    However, this process was not long. I drew a lot of strength from Chairman Mao's works. First of all, by studying Chairman Mao's works, I further understood that performing operas is not just for entertaining the masses. It is a revolution, a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and eliminate the enemy. In particular, Chairman Mao said, "Revolutionary literature and art should create various characters based on actual life to help the masses push history forward." The emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties I played in the past, although many people applauded me, could these operas help the masses in the socialist era push history forward? No, they could not. I have performed traditional operas for many years in the past, and many of them were the result of my hard work since childhood. To give them up, to be honest, I couldn't help but feel a little attached. However, Chairman Mao's words rang in my ears, and the cries of the suffering brothers and sisters in the old society rang in my ears. These things educated me and gave me confidence. If I could perform Hua Mulan, Mu Guiying, and Hong Niang well in the past, why can't I create heroic figures of the socialist era on stage today who are many times better than them? This is not only an artistic issue, but also a political issue, an issue of class stand and class feelings.
    In 1963 and 1964, I continuously performed "Chaoyang Ditch" and "Li Shuangshuang." I loved the characters Li Shuangshuang and Aunt Shuanbao very much. Li Shuangshuang was selfless and outspoken; Aunt Shuanbao was simple, kind, loved the mountainous area, and loved the new life. I have met many such characters in real life, and I want to perform them through artistic creation on stage. Although my performance is not very accurate yet, I feel that I can directly contribute to socialism, because I played the new type of women of the socialist era, and I feel much more relaxed in my heart. At the same time, Li Shuangshuang and Aunt Shuanbao are the main characters in the play, and their ideological realm is relatively high, so I felt relatively happy when creating these two characters. But this time, when playing Aunt Wu in "Happy People and Neighing Horses," my mood was different. Although Aunt Wu is also a member of the working people and is honest and loyal, due to the influence of the old habits, there are still some old ideas in the depths of her soul. At the same time, there are too many levels in the play, which is not easy to grasp, and she is not the main character in the play, and I don't like her personality. Therefore, when the leadership asked me to take on this role, I had some ideological fluctuations. Due to insufficient understanding of the importance of playing Aunt Wu well, I did not complete the task well when I first took on this role in 1964. In order to solve this problem, the leadership helped me study Chairman Mao's works on the one hand, and let me go to the countryside to experience life on the other hand. In the "three togethers" with the masses, I personally saw many female commune members. In order to build a new socialist countryside, they would carry soil if they were told to, and they would go into the pond if they were told to. They would do whatever they were told to do. However, when I was performing, I had ideological fluctuations because I was playing a minor role. Compared to them, I couldn't help but feel ashamed. The education I received from the masses made me determined: I will perform whatever the Party wants me to perform, and I will not only perform, but also try my best to perform well. So I happily re-accepted the task of playing Aunt Wu.
    Playing the role of Aunt Wu made me deeply realize that we cannot leave Mao Zedong's thought even when creating a character and portraying his or her personality. If we proceed purely from an artistic point of view and ignore the guidance of Mao Zedong's thought, we cannot create a good artistic image. Because the modern operas we perform are about people of the socialist era. Whether we perform our heroic figures or the people with shortcomings, in order to help them move forward, we must use the method of class analysis to create characters. The criticism of Aunt Wu in "Happy People and Neighing Horses" must also be well-measured. When she reproaches Wu Guangxing for selling her hen to buy salt, we must understand her strengths in being diligent and thrifty in managing the household, and we must not excessively ridicule or mock her. After she has been educated by the struggle between the two roads in real life, we should show her transformation from the depths of her soul and show the essence of her as a working person. Otherwise, Aunt Wu will not be a lovable aunt.
    Because I have not studied Chairman Mao's works deeply enough, and because my experience in life and learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers has just begun, I have not been able to solve the problems of how to create heroic figures in modern operas, how to reform and apply opera performance routines, and so on. I am willing to advance together with comrades under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and contribute my strength to praising socialism and singing for the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

### 毛主席的思想照亮了我——谈谈我演革命现代戏的体会

    毛主席的思想照亮了我
    ——谈谈我演革命现代戏的体会
    常香玉
    我演了三十多年戏，走的道路十分曲折。在传统戏中是演青衣、花旦和闺门旦的。我喜欢扮演那些性格豪迈，在强敌面前英勇不屈的人物，如穆桂英、花木兰。也喜欢扮演红娘那样的人物。但总没有跳出帝王将相、才子佳人的圈子。解放以后，我开始读毛主席的著作，使我得到很大启发，特别是读了《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》后，我明白了文艺应当为工农兵服务，明确了文艺工作者的方向。但这只是在理论上有了新的认识，如何和我的艺术创造结合，如何用毛主席的思想作为武器，来改造我的主观世界，清除旧思想，旧意识的影响，把自己的立足点移到无产阶级方向上来，还没有彻底解决。
    一九五三年我到朝鲜去为最可爱的人——志愿军演出，接着又下厂、下矿、上山下乡为工人、农民演出，见到了许多先进人物，遇见许多可歌可泣的英雄事迹，这时，我产生了一个愿望，要是能在舞台上，演演社会主义时代的英雄妇女，该多好啊！这时我重新读了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，其中谈到：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民”。看了这几句话，我思想斗争非常剧烈：一方面决心要试着演一演现代戏，一方面又害怕演不好，惹人笑话。一九五六年，我演出了第一个现代戏《漳河湾》。在这出戏里，我演的是一个青年姑娘，虽说我的热情很高，但是由于我没有生活，对农村姑娘不熟悉，演的很不成功。心想，还是走老路演我的穆桂英、花木兰、红娘吧！可是在以后继续读毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的时候，心总是怦怦地跳，就好象理亏似的，要演现代戏的心又复活起来。一九五七年我们排演了革命历史剧《母亲》，我扮演母亲，也没有演好。一九五八年，在党和同志们的帮助下，我又鼓着勇气，重新排演了现代戏。在《朝阳沟》中扮演拴保娘。由于总结了上两次的经验教训，又因为初步有了生活，特别是学习毛主席著作比以前多了，所以这一次戏比上两次有了一些进步。但是我作难可也真不小：过去的身段、旧的表演程式不能用，新的一套又没有，出场、台步、手势、眼神不知怎么用才合适。特别是我在思想上、生活上、技巧上，都还没有把功夫下到，因此给我在思想上带来不少苦恼。
    不过这个过程并不长，我从毛主席著作中，吸取不少力量。首先是通过学习毛主席著作，我进一步懂得演戏不光是给群众娱乐，这是革命，是团结人民、教育人民，打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器。特别是毛主席说的“革命的文艺，应当根据实际生活创造出各种各样的人物来，帮助群众推动历史的前进。”我过去演的帝王将相、才子佳人，虽有不少人给我喝彩，但这些戏能帮助社会主义时代的群众推动历史前进吗？不能，不能。过去我演了许多年传统戏，而且很多都是我从小苦学出来的，要丢开它，说实在话，心里免不了要有些留恋。但是，毛主席的话在我耳边响着，旧社会受苦受难的父老兄弟姐妹的哭声在我耳边响着。这些事情教育了我，使我树立了信心，过去能演好花木兰、穆桂英、红娘，为什么今天不能在舞台上塑造比她们不知要高明多少倍的社会主义时代的英雄人物呢？这不仅是个艺术问题，而且也是一个政治问题，是阶级立场、阶级感情问题。
    在一九六三、一九六四两年中，我连续演出了《朝阳沟》和《李双双》。李双双、拴保娘这两个人物，我都十分喜爱。李双双大公无私，心直口快；拴保娘淳朴善良、热爱山区，热爱新的生活。我在实际生活中，遇着不少这种人物，在舞台上我要通过艺术创造把她们表演出来。虽说我演的还不太象，但是我感到，我能直接为社会主义出力了，因为我扮演了社会主义时代的新型妇女，心里就轻松的多。同时李双双、拴保娘都是戏中的主要人物，她们的思想境界也比较高，因此在创造李双双、拴保娘这两个角色时，我心里比较高兴。但是这次扮演《人欢马叫》中的吴大娘时，心情就不同了。吴大娘这个人物，虽说也是劳动人民，人也憨厚忠诚，但是由于旧的习惯势力的影响，在她灵魂深处还有一些旧的意识。同时，戏的层次太多，不容易掌握，她在戏中又不是主要人物，她的性格我不喜爱，因此领导上叫我担任这个角色时，思想上有些波动。由于对演好吴大娘的重要意义认识不足，所以一九六四年我在初次担任这个角色时，任务完成得不好。为了解决这个问题，领导上一面帮助我学习毛主席著作，一面让我到农村深入生活。在和群众三同中，我亲自看到许多女社员，为了建设社会主义新农村，说抬土就抬土，说下塘就下塘，叫干啥就干啥，而我在演戏时却因为演次要角色，便引起思想波动，对比起来，脸上就不禁热辣辣的。群众对我的教育，使我下定了决心：党要我演啥我就演啥，不但要演，而且还要千方百计来演好。于是我就愉快地重新接受了扮演吴大娘的任务。
    扮演吴大娘这一角色，使我深深体会到，就是在创造角色，刻划人物性格上也是不能离开毛主席思想的。如果单纯从艺术的角度出发，忽视毛主席思想的指导，也是不能把艺术形象塑造好的。因为我们演的现代戏是社会主义时代的人。演我们的英雄人物也好，演人民当中有缺点的人也好，为了要帮助他们前进，就必须用阶级分析的方法来创造角色。对《人欢马叫》中吴大娘的批评，分寸也要掌握好。当她责备吴广兴把她的母鸡卖了买盐的时候，要体谅她勤俭持家的长处，不能过分地挖苦她，嘲笑她。当她经过现实生活中两条道路斗争的教育后，应当从灵魂深处表现她的转变，表现她那劳动人民的本质。否则吴大娘就不是一个可爱的大娘了。
    由于毛主席著作我还学得不深不透，深入生活和向工农兵学习也才刚刚开始，演现代戏如何塑造英雄人物，改革运用戏曲表演程式等等，还没能解决得很好。我愿在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗指引下，和同志们一道前进，为歌颂社会主义，歌唱工农兵贡献出我的力量。（附图片）
