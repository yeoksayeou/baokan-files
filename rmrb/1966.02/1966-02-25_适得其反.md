　　Counterproductive
　　By Our Correspondent
    After the Honolulu Conference, U.S. Vice President Hubert Humphrey took a trip to a series of countries and regions in Asia and Oceania. Those who come are not kind, and those who are kind do not come. From Humphrey's activities, we can see that his Far East trip had two purposes: one was to peddle the Johnson administration's plan to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, according to the decisions of the Honolulu Conference, especially to get other countries to provide more cannon fodder to act as scapegoats for the American aggressors; the other was to promote the so-called "containment" of China policy, piecing together an Asian aggressive alliance against China.
    But what role did Humphrey's Far East trip actually play, and what did he gain? Granted, he collected some cannon fodder from the reactionary authorities in South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, and he used a $100 million loan to encourage the Indian reactionaries' anti-China policy. But since the 200,000 American troops have been beaten into a dead end by the South Vietnamese people, what good can adding a little more grave goods do? The Indian reactionaries were already working hard to oppose China, so what can further encouragement do?
    The real role of Humphrey's Far East trip does not lie here. The answer to this question can be found by looking at how the people of Asia and Oceania "welcomed" him. Everywhere Humphrey went, he aroused strong anti-American waves among the broad masses of people. "Yankee, go home!" "Murderer, go home!" "Get out of South Vietnam!" "The American devils are the number one enemy of mankind!" and other slogans resounded through the clouds. Especially in the Philippines and New Zealand, the mass anti-American demonstrations frightened Humphrey. In Pakistan, politicians and newspapers also condemned Humphrey's remarks that provoked Sino-Pakistani relations, and expressed indignation at the U.S. attempt to coerce Pakistan into opposing China.
    These facts once again confirm a famous thesis of Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong said: The aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism always go against its wishes, "It has played the role of mobilizing the people of the world to rise up against the American aggressors."
    Humphrey originally wanted to "mobilize" the countries of Asia and Oceania to support U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, but the result was to mobilize the people of various countries to oppose U.S. imperialism. He originally wanted to "mobilize" the countries of Asia and Oceania to surround China, but the result was to mobilize the broad masses of people to surround U.S. imperialism more closely. He originally wanted to "mobilize" the countries of Asia and Oceania to form an anti-China alliance, but the result was to mobilize the people of various countries to form a united front against the United States. This role played by the U.S. imperialists cannot be replaced by anyone. The more rampant and insidious its aggressive activities, the greater this anti-American mobilization role it plays. U.S. imperialism will never give up its mobilization work, and will inevitably do it tirelessly until the people of the world, including the American people, rise up and attack it, sentencing U.S. imperialism to death.

　　适得其反
　　本报评论员
    美国副总统汉弗莱，在檀香山会议之后，到亚洲和大洋洲的一系列国家和地区，走了一遭。来者不善，善者不来。从汉弗莱所进行的活动中可以看到，他的远东之行，有两个目的：一个是根据檀香山会议的决定，兜售约翰逊政府扩大侵越战争的计划，特别是要别的国家提供更多的炮灰，来作美国侵略者的替死鬼；另一个是推行所谓“遏制”中国的政策，拼凑针对中国的亚洲侵略联盟。
    但是，汉弗莱的远东之行究竟起了什么作用，得到了什么收获呢？固然，他从南朝鲜、菲律宾、澳大利亚和新西兰的反动当局那里搜罗了一些炮灰，他用一亿美元的贷款鼓励了印度反动派的反华政策。可是，美国的二十万大军既然被南越人民打得一筹莫展，再填上一点陪葬品，又能顶什么事呢？印度反动派本来就在大卖力气地反华，即使再鼓励一番，又能有什么作为呢？
    汉弗莱的远东之行所真正起的作用并不在这里。看一看亚洲和大洋洲人民是怎样“欢迎”他的，就可以找到这个问题的答案了。汉弗莱所到之处，激起了广大人民的强烈反美浪潮。“美国佬，滚回去！”“杀人犯，滚回去！”“滚出南越！”“美国佬是人类的头号敌人！”等等口号，响彻云霄。特别是在菲律宾和新西兰，群众的反美示威，使汉弗莱吓得发抖。在巴基斯坦，政界人士和报纸也纷纷谴责汉弗莱挑拨中巴关系的言论，并且对美国企图胁迫巴基斯坦反华的阴谋表示愤慨。
    这些事实，又一次证实了毛泽东同志的一个著名的论断。毛泽东同志说过：美帝国主义的侵略活动，总是走向它的愿望的反面，“它起了动员全世界人民起来反对美国侵略者的作用。”
    汉弗莱本来是想要“动员”亚洲和大洋洲各国支持美帝国主义侵略越南的，结果却起了动员各国人民反对美帝国主义的作用。他本来是想要“动员”亚洲和大洋洲各国包围中国的，结果却起了动员广大人民更紧密地包围美帝国主义的作用。他本来是想要“动员”亚洲和大洋洲各国组成反华联盟的，结果却起了动员各国人民结成反美统一战线的作用。美帝国主义者所起的这种作用，是任何人也不能代替的。它进行的侵略活动越猖狂，越阴险，它起的这种动员反美的作用就越大。美帝国主义决不会放弃它的这种动员工作，而必然要孜孜不倦地做下去，直到包括美国人民在内的全世界人民群起而攻之，把美帝国主义处以死刑。
