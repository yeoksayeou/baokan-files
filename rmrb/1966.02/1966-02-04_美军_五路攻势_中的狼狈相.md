    The Embarrassing Situation of the US Military's "Five-Pronged Offensive"
    Trapped in a Triangle of Encirclement and Beaten

    United Press International photographer Nostrap reported on the embarrassing situation of "Operation Dagger" in a dispatch one day, excerpted as follows:
    Mortar shells exploded nearby, and machine gun bullets whistled a few inches overhead. We squirmed, shrinking deeper into the hole.
    I was scared to death. Both sides fought fiercely all day for this village. Now that we have entered the village, the communists are counterattacking.
    It was at night, tracer bullets cut through the dark night sky. The communists formed a triangle of encirclement around us and fired from all directions.
    The battle took place in the early morning. The area is about three hundred miles northeast of Saigon. It is a rice paddy and sugarcane field. This is a grassy area where the Viet Cong have controlled this area for some years.

    Forced to Retreat but Unable to Escape Close Combat
    Not far outside this village, the Viet Cong opened fire from a dense palm grove. It was a fierce attack.
    Captain Dawkins is an American advisor to the South Vietnamese paratroopers. He later said to me:
    "We were advancing, but it was difficult... two men moved from one tree to another each time. We came to a place where the Viet Cong were crossfiring with two heavy machine guns... They were about fifty yards away.
    "When we started to retreat, the Viet Cong started the 'hugging' action. They approached us as we retreated... They did this to avoid being bombed. They got as close to us as possible."
    As the battle continued, hand-to-hand combat took place from time to time, and the paratroopers' ammunition was reduced to a dangerous level.
    After unloading the supplies from the helicopter, Major Honnicut, the company commander, hurriedly loaded twenty dead and wounded men onto the plane.

    The Trench Presented a Tragic Scene
    This is a report from Associated Press reporter Bob Puth and photographer Henry Shute on January 30, excerpted as follows:
      A lump of mud crawled from a cratered no-man's land toward our trench—a trench that was originally the property of the communists, but is now our refuge, as well as our hospital and morgue.
    The lump of mud was an American infantryman who had plunged headfirst into the trench a few minutes earlier, wounded in the hip. A medic struggled through the bodies of American soldiers and the wounded in the trench. Rain was falling, bullets were crackling, and the wounded were piled up—the trench presented a tragic scene.
    The communists had dug deep trenches in the sand. Soldiers of the Cavalry Division attacked through an open rice paddy under heavy sniper fire, which felled several soldiers of the Cavalry Division.
    Medic Thomas Cole himself was wounded in the head, and he helped take care of the wounded who were lying haphazardly in the trench. Because he had a bandage wrapped around his head, he was almost blind.

    Everywhere Were Shell Craters, Corpses, and Wounded
    The command post of the Second Battalion of the Seventh Regiment was located in a very deep trench, while the main force of the communists fought in fortifications behind a row of palm trees. Enemy snipers with automatic weapons were hidden in the woods on both sides of the command post.
    The light of dawn revealed a picture of bloody battle—corpses and wounded lying in the muddy trenches, empty bullet clips and ration boxes discarded everywhere, and shell craters everywhere.
    This was a dawn that did not come peacefully.

### 美军“五路攻势”中的狼狈相

专栏：外论摘要

    美军“五路攻势”中的狼狈相
    陷于三角形包围圈中挨打
    合众国际社摄影记者诺斯塔普一日报道了“捣碎机行动”的狼狈状况，摘要如下：
    迫击炮弹在附近爆炸，机枪子弹在头上几寸高的地方呼啸而过。我们蠕动着，更深地缩到洞里。
    我吓得要命。为了争夺这个村子，双方激战了一整天。现在我们进入这个村子了，共产党人在进行反攻。
    那是在夜里，曳光弹划破了黑暗的夜空。共军对我们形成一个三角形的包围圈，并从四面八方进行射击。
    战斗是在清晨发生的。这个地区是在西贡东北大约三百英里。这是一片稻田和蔗田。这是一个草木丛生的地方，越共控制这个地区已经有一些年了。
    被迫后退却逃不出白刃战
    就在这个村子外面不远，越共从一片茂密的棕榈林里开火。这是一次凶猛的进攻。
    道金斯上尉是南越伞兵的美国顾问。他后来对我说：
   “我们当时正在前进，但是很困难……每次两人从一棵树走到另一棵树。我们走到了越共用两挺重机枪交叉射击的地方……他们大约在五十码以外的地方。
    “当我们开始后退的时候，越共开始搞‘拥抱’行动。他们在我们后退时逼近我们……他们这样做是为了避免挨炸。他们尽可能地向我们靠近。”
    随着战斗继续进行，不时进行白刃战，伞兵们的弹药减少到危险的程度。
    连长霍尼卡特少校把直升飞机上的东西卸完之后，赶紧把二十名死伤的人装上飞机。
   战壕里呈现一片悲惨的景象
    这是美联社记者鲍勃·普斯和摄影记者亨利·休特一月三十日的报道，摘要如下：
      一个泥团从一块弹坑累累的无人地段爬向我们的战壕——这个战壕原先是共产党人的财产，而现在是我们的避难所，而且也是我们的医院和停尸场。
    这个泥团是一名美国步兵，他在几分钟以前一头栽到战壕里，臀部受了伤。一名军医费力地穿过战壕里的美国兵尸体和受伤者走过来。雨在下着，枪弹在噼啪地响，伤员堆成堆——战壕里呈现一片悲惨景象。
    共产党人在沙地上挖出了很深的战壕。骑兵师的士兵们在猛烈的狙击火力下，通过一片开阔的稻田发动进攻，狙击火力打倒了几名骑兵师的士兵。
    军医托马斯·科尔自己的头部受了伤，他帮助照料乱七八糟地躺在战壕里的伤员们。由于他头上缠着绷带，他差不多跟瞎子一样。
    到处是炮弹坑、尸体和伤员
    第七团第二营的指挥所设在一个很深的战壕里，而共产党的主力部队在一排棕榈树后面的工事里战斗。敌人的狙击手携带着自动武器隐藏在指挥部两边的树林里。
    黎明的光线照出一幅血腥战斗的图景——躺在泥泞不堪的战壕中的尸体和伤员，到处丢弃着空的子弹夹和口粮盒，到处是炮弹坑。
    这是一个并不是和和平平地来临的一个黎明。
