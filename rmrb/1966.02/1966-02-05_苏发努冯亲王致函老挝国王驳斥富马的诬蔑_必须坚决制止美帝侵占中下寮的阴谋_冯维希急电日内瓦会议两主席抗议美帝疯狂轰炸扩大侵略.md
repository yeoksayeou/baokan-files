    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 4th—According to a Pathet Lao Radio broadcast: Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and Deputy Prime Minister of the Lao Tripartite National Union Government, wrote a letter to the King of Laos on January 26, requesting him to take measures to stop the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to directly send troops to invade Laos.

    The letter pointed out that for many years, U.S. imperialism has been trying to occupy the central and lower regions of Laos in order to turn this region into a bridgehead connecting South Vietnam and its bases in Thailand. After U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara visited South Vietnam at the end of November last year, Washington authorities have repeatedly spoken publicly about sending U.S. Army troops to directly occupy the central and lower regions of Laos and using B-52 type aircraft to bomb the Lao liberated areas.

    The letter said, "In order to cover up the above extremely dangerous new military conspiracy, U.S. imperialism and the Kouprasith-Sananikone group have resorted to their usual trick of fabricating many false evidences to slander the Lao Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, claiming that the Lao Patriotic Front's forces, reinforced by North Vietnamese troops, are attacking the right-wing forces in the central region of Laos, and falsely claiming that they have captured North Vietnamese troops in Laos, etc."

    The letter pointed out that the purpose of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in spreading the above rumors is merely to pave the way for the United States to directly send troops to invade Laos.

    The letter said that in the face of U.S. imperialism's new military conspiracy, Prince Souvanna Phouma, on the one hand, expressed disapproval of the United States directly sending troops to Laos, and on the other hand, continuously slandered the Lao Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam based on the old deceptive arguments of the United States.

    The letter pointed out that Prince Souvanna Phouma's actions are conducive to U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression.

    The letter also pointed out that Prince Souvanna Phouma, instead of creating favorable conditions for a meeting of the three princes under the current circumstances, is bent on taking hostile actions against the Lao Patriotic Front, which resolutely opposes U.S. imperialism, which makes people have reason to doubt Prince Souvanna Phouma's attitude.

    The letter pointed out that because U.S. imperialism is trying to send troops to openly occupy central and lower Laos, the current situation in Laos has reached an extremely serious point. If measures are not taken immediately to stop this conspiracy of U.S. imperialism, then the disasters of war will not only expand to the whole of Laos, but also expand to the entire Indochina. The letter concluded that in the current situation, the only way out for the Lao people is to unite closely and, together with the peoples of the Indochinese countries who are being invaded by U.S. imperialism, wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression until final victory is achieved.

    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 3rd—According to a Pathet Lao Radio broadcast on the 3rd, Phoumi Vongvichit sent an urgent telegram to the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Laos on February 1, strongly protesting against the U.S. imperialists and their South Vietnamese and Lao lackeys for frantically bombing the Lao liberated areas, attempting to introduce U.S. troops into Laos to directly participate in the war, so as to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochinese peninsula.

    Phoumi Vongvichit sent this telegram in his capacity as Secretary-General of the Lao Patriotic Front, Minister of Information, Propaganda and Tourism of the Lao Tripartite National Union Government, and member of the Central Committee for the Supervision and Implementation of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos.

    The telegram said: "I strongly protest against this frantic war act of the U.S. imperialists and their South Vietnamese and Lao lackeys, and demand that they immediately stop bombing the liberated areas controlled by the Lao patriotic forces, and abandon their conspiracy and actions of aggression against Laos. If they insist on disregarding this serious warning from the Lao people and public opinion, then the Lao people and patriotic forces have already resolved to give them the counterattacks they deserve. They must bear all responsibility for their aggressive actions."

    The telegram said that since the end of November 1965, various types of bombers and jet fighters of the Americans and their South Vietnamese lackeys, taking off from the U.S. Seventh Fleet and their bases in Thailand and South Vietnam, as well as aircraft of the U.S. lackeys in Laos, have been carrying out hundreds of air raids every day on the liberated areas controlled by the patriotic forces in Upper Laos, Central Laos, and Lower Laos, wantonly dropping thousands of tons of bombs. They have even used napalm bombs, phosphorus incendiary bombs, and released chemical toxins to massacre the Lao people and destroy crops. The scale of the air raids is getting bigger and bigger, with fifteen to twenty batches of aircraft carrying out two hundred to three hundred sorties a day.

    The telegram said: "The recent stepped-up bombing and strafing by U.S. and lackey aircraft, while intensifying incursions into the Lao liberated areas, is an integral part of their entire conspiracy to expand the war of aggression to Laos and Indochina."

    The telegram said: "I firmly demand that the two chairmen inform the governments of the participating countries of the 1961-1962 Geneva Conference on Laos of the deteriorating situation in Laos caused by the increased bombing of the Lao liberated areas by the air force of the United States and its South Vietnamese and Lao lackeys, and at the same time immediately take appropriate emergency measures to stop their aggressive actions and make them respect and correctly implement the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos."

    苏发努冯亲王致函老挝国王驳斥富马的诬蔑
    必须坚决制止美帝侵占中下寮的阴谋
    冯维希急电日内瓦会议两主席抗议美帝疯狂轰炸扩大侵略
    新华社康开四日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席、老挝三方民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王一月二十六日写信给老挝国王，要求他采取措施，制止美帝国主义阴谋直接出兵侵略老挝。
    信件指出，多年来，美帝国主义就妄图占领老挝中寮和下寮地区，以便把这个地区变成连接越南南方和它在泰国的基地的桥头堡。美国国防部长麦克纳马拉去年十一月底到越南南方以后，华盛顿当局就多次公开谈及派遣美国陆军直接占领老挝中寮和下寮地区以及使用B—52型飞机轰炸老挝解放区的问题。
    信件说，“为了掩盖上述极其危险的新的军事阴谋，美帝国主义和库帕拉西—萨纳尼空集团耍出它们的惯伎，捏造许多假证据来诬蔑老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国，说什么得到北越军队增援的老挝爱国战线党军队，进攻中寮地区的右派军队，又胡说什么它们在老挝俘虏了北越军队，等等。”
    信件指出，美帝国主义及其走狗散布上述谣言的目的，不过是为美国直接出兵侵略老挝铺平道路而已。
    信件说，面对着美帝国主义的新的军事阴谋，梭发那·富马亲王一方面表示不赞成美国直接派兵到老挝，另一方面，又根据美国陈旧的欺骗论调，不断诬蔑老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国。
    信件指出，梭发那·富马亲王的这一行径是有利于美帝国主义的侵略政策的。
    信件还指出，梭发那·富马亲王在当前形势下不但不为三亲王的会晤创造顺利条件，反而一味对坚决反对美帝国主义的老挝爱国战线党采取敌对行动，这使得人们有根据怀疑梭发那·富马亲王的态度。
    信件指出，由于美帝国主义妄图派兵公开侵占中、下寮，老挝目前的局势已到了极其严重的地步。如果不立即采取措施制止美帝国主义的这一阴谋，那么，战争的灾难不仅会扩大到老挝全国，而且将扩大到整个印度支那。信件最后说，在当前的形势下，老挝人民唯一出路是紧密团结，同正遭到美帝国主义侵略的印度支那各国人民一起，进行坚决反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争，直至取得最后胜利。
    据新华社康开三日电　据巴特寮电台三日广播，富米·冯维希二月一日打紧急电报给关于老挝问题的日内瓦会议两主席，强烈抗议美帝国主义及其南越和老挝的仆从疯狂轰炸老挝解放区，企图把美国军队引进老挝直接参战，以便把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那半岛。
    富米·冯维希是以老挝爱国战线党总书记、老挝三方民族团结政府新闻、宣传和游览大臣和老挝监察执行一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议中央委员会委员的身份发出这封电报的。
    电报说：“我强烈抗议美帝国主义及其南越和老挝的仆从的这种疯狂的战争行径，并且要求他们立即停止轰炸老挝爱国力量控制下的解放区，放弃他们侵略老挝的阴谋和行动。如果他们执意不顾老挝人民和舆论的这一严重警告，那么老挝人民和爱国力量已经决心给予他们应有的反击。他们必须对自己的侵略行动承担全部责任。”
    电报说，自从一九六五年十一月底以来，从美国第七舰队及其在泰国和南越的基地起飞的美国人及其南越仆从的各种类型的轰炸机和喷气式战斗机，以及美国人在老挝的仆从的飞机，每天对上寮、中寮和下寮地区爱国力量控制下的解放区进行几百次的空袭，肆无忌惮地掷下好几千吨炸弹。他们竟然使用凝固汽油弹、磷燃烧弹，并且撒放化学毒剂，来屠杀老挝人民和毁坏庄稼。空袭的规模越来越大，每天有十五到二十批飞机进行二百到三百架次的空袭。
    电报说：“美国及其仆从的飞机最近加紧进行轰炸和扫射，同时加紧进犯老挝解放区，这是他们把侵略战争扩大到老挝和印度支那的整个阴谋的一个组成部分。”
    电报说：“我坚决要求两主席把由于美国及其南越和老挝的仆从的空军加强对老挝解放区的轰炸而造成的不断恶化的老挝局势，通知给一九六一——一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦会议参加国的政府，同时立即采取适当的紧急措施，来制止他们的侵略行动，并且使他们尊重和正确执行一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。”
