    Today marks the fifth anniversary of the unification of the heroic South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces. The Chinese people, with the hearts of comrades-in-arms, extend the warmest congratulations and the most profound respect to the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces.
    Over the past five years, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have blazed trails, fought bloody battles, grown in struggle, and strengthened in the flames of war. They have annihilated a large number of the enemy's active forces, liberated four-fifths of South Vietnam's land and over ten million people, and achieved glorious victories. On the South Vietnam battlefield, the situation has emerged that the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces are becoming stronger and stronger in battle, firmly grasping the initiative of the war, and can maneuver freely and fight on all fronts; while the American aggressors and their running dogs are trapped in a passive, beaten, and desperate situation. The trend of the South Vietnamese people's inevitable victory and the American aggressor troops and their running dogs' inevitable defeat has been irrevocably established.
    The five years of heroic struggle by the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have set a brilliant example for the revolutionary struggles of oppressed people and oppressed nations. "Only heroes drive out tigers and leopards, no great men fear bears and wolves." It tells people with vivid examples that the comparison of strength between the enemy and ourselves can be changed, and that American imperialism, which possesses a huge military machine, can be defeated.
    Does the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have airplanes, artillery, and tanks? No. They initially had only machetes, homemade guns, and bamboo spikes. Does the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have officers who graduated from military schools? No. They are ordinary people from the countryside. Did the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces participate in combat after being well-trained? No, they put down their hoes yesterday, and today they have learned warfare from warfare. It is those people's armed forces with primitive weapons that defeated imperialism equipped with all kinds of modern weapons; it is those rough fellows with mud on their legs who defeated generals from West Point Military Academy in the United States; it is the ordinary laborers on the land of South Vietnam who defeated the well-trained American aggressor troops.
    The glorious victory of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces may seem like a miracle, but in fact, it contains the simplest truth.
    This is because they represent the people. The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces hold high the banner against American imperialism's aggression, fight for the liberation and independence of the Vietnamese nation, fight for the freedom and happiness of the South Vietnamese people, and fight for the sacred cause of realizing national reunification. They represent the fundamental interests of all 14 million South Vietnamese people and reflect the universal aspirations of the Vietnamese nation. In this way, they have won the love and support of the 14 million South Vietnamese people and have gained invincible great strength.
    This is because they have implemented a complete set of strategies and tactics of people's war. In battle, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have exploited their own strengths and exposed the enemy's weaknesses, using their strengths to attack the enemy's weaknesses. They closely rely on the people, arm the people, and launch struggles against the enemy in various forms, making South Vietnam a battlefield everywhere, everyone a soldier, turning the entire South into a vast ocean surrounding the enemy, and a net that annihilates the enemy.
    This is because they have a high degree of consciousness and courage. The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces deeply understand that they are fighting for justice and for national liberation. They have infinite love for the people and the motherland, and deep hatred for the American aggressors and their running dogs. This high degree of class consciousness and the firm will to fight for national liberation have given them the incomparable courage to be unafraid of violence and sacrifice, and have given them the infinite wisdom and strength to be good at annihilating all enemies and conquering any difficulties. With such a high degree of consciousness and courage, they have the best weapon, the spiritual atomic bomb, and the greatest combat power that is invincible.
    The history of the heroic struggle of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces proves that the oppressed people and oppressed nations of the world, in order to achieve independence and liberation, must establish a revolutionary people's armed force to oppose the counter-revolutionary armed forces of imperialism and its running dogs. Without the armed forces of the people, there is no liberation and freedom of the people, no independence and unity of the nation, and no everything for the people.
    The Vietnam War is the focus of the world people's anti-American struggle. The great struggle waged by the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces and the people of the South is not only for the realization of the liberation and reunification of the Vietnamese nation, but also relates to the overall situation of the international class struggle. The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces and the South Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America for national salvation has made a strong support and contribution to the liberation cause of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America, and to the revolutionary cause of the people of the world.
    Now, the American imperialists have been beaten to a pulp on the South Vietnam battlefield and have exhausted their tricks. They cannot win by fighting, nor can they deceive. They do not want to leave. In this situation, the arch-criminal of aggression, Johnson, recently personally came forward, convened the Honolulu Conference, planned a way out, and plotted to continue to use the "peace" smokescreen to cover up the deployment of the expanded war of aggression against Vietnam, attempting to make further frenzied struggles. The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces and the South Vietnamese people have already learned many times about the American aggressors' counter-revolutionary double-dealing tactics. They are neither afraid of the enemy's war threats, nor are they deceived by the "good words" on the aggressor's lips. They are determined to carry the war of resistance against America for national salvation to the end and to drive all the American aggressors out of South Vietnam. The Chinese people have always stood on the side of the Vietnamese people, supporting the just position of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, supporting the just struggle of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces and the South Vietnamese people, until the American aggressors are defeated and final victory is achieved. We believe that the struggle of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces and the South Vietnamese people will surely achieve final victory, and the Vietnamese people's desire for national reunification will surely be realized.

    独有英雄驱虎豹
    ——庆祝越南南方解放武装力量统一五周年
    今天，是英雄的越南南方解放武装力量统一五周年。中国人民怀着战友的心情，向越南南方解放武装力量致以最热烈的祝贺和最崇高的敬意。
    五年来，越南南方解放武装力量披荆斩棘，浴血奋战，在斗争中成长，在战火中壮大。它歼灭了敌人大量的有生力量，解放了南越五分之四的土地、一千万以上的人口，取得了辉煌的胜利。在南越战场上，已经出现了这样的局面：越南南方解放武装力量越战越强，并且紧紧掌握着战争主动权，可以纵横驰骋，四出作战；而美国侵略者及其走狗则陷于被动挨打、走投无路的困境。越南南方人民必胜，美国侵略军及其走狗必败，这一趋势已经无可改变地确定下来了。
    越南南方解放武装力量五年来英勇斗争的历程，为被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争树立了一个光辉的榜样。“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”它以活生生的事例告诉人们：敌我力量的对比是可以改变的，拥有庞大的军事机器的美帝国主义是可以打败的。
    越南南方解放武装力量有飞机、大炮和坦克吗？没有。他们最初只有弯刀、土枪和竹尖桩。越南南方解放武装力量有军事学校毕业的军官吗？没有。他们是来自农村的普通老百姓。越南南方解放武装力量是训练好了以后才参加作战的吗？不，他们昨天放下了锄头，今天已经从战争中学会了战争。就是那些拿着原始武器的人民武装，打败了用各种现代化武器装备的帝国主义；就是那些两腿泥巴的大老粗，打败了美国西点军校出身的将军；就是南越土地上的普通劳动者，打败了训练有素的美国侵略军。
    越南南方解放武装力量的辉煌胜利，看来好象是个奇迹，其实，它蕴含着最朴实不过的真理。
    这是因为，他们代表人民。越南南方解放武装力量高举反对美帝国主义侵略的大旗，为越南民族的解放和独立而战，为南越人民的自由和幸福而战，为实现祖国统一的神圣事业而战。他们代表了全体南越人民的根本利益，反映了越南民族的普遍愿望。这样，他们就得到了一千四百万南越人民的爱戴和拥护，就获得了不可战胜的伟大力量。
    这是因为，他们实行了一整套人民战争的战略战术。越南南方解放武装力量在战斗中发扬了自己的优点，暴露了敌人的缺点，以己之长，攻敌之短。他们紧紧地依靠人民，武装人民，用各种形式展开对敌斗争，使越南南方处处是战场，人人是战士，把整个南方变成了包围敌人的汪洋大海，歼灭敌人的天罗地网。
    这是因为，他们具有高度的觉悟和勇敢精神。越南南方解放武装力量深深懂得，他们是为正义而战，为民族解放而战。他们对人民、对祖国无限热爱，对美国侵略者及其走狗抱有深仇大恨。这种高度的阶级觉悟和争取民族解放的坚强意志，使他们产生了不畏强暴、不怕牺牲的无比勇敢精神，使他们产生了善于歼灭一切敌人、征服任何困难的无穷智慧和力量。有了这样高度觉悟和勇敢精神，就有了精神原子弹这种最好的武器，就有了所向无敌的最大的战斗力。
    越南南方解放武装力量英勇斗争的历史证明，世界上被压迫人民和被压迫民族，要求得独立和解放，就必须建立一支革命的人民武装力量，去反对帝国主义及其走狗的反革命武装力量。没有人民的武装，就没有人民的解放和自由，就没有民族的独立和统一，就没有人民的一切。
    越南战争是当前世界人民反美斗争的焦点。越南南方解放武装力量和南方人民进行的这场伟大斗争，不仅是为了实现越南民族的解放和统一大业，而且也关系着国际阶级斗争的全局。越南南方解放武装力量和南方人民的抗美救国斗争，对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民解放事业，对世界人民的革命事业，作出了有力的支援和贡献。
    现在，美帝国主义者在南越战场上已经被打得焦头烂额，黔驴技穷。打，又打不赢。骗，又骗不了。走，又不肯走。在这种情况下，侵略罪魁约翰逊最近亲自出马，召开了檀香山会议，筹谋出路，策划了继续利用“和平”烟幕，掩盖扩大侵越战争的部署，妄图进一步作疯狂挣扎。越南南方解放武装力量和南方人民，对于美国侵略者的这反革命两手，早已领教过多少次了。他们既不怕敌人的战争威胁，也不被侵略者嘴上的“好话”所迷惑。他们下定决心，要把抗美救国斗争进行到底，要把美国侵略者统统从南越赶出去。中国人民一贯站在越南人民一边，支持越南南方民族解放阵线的严正立场，支持越南南方解放武装力量和南方人民的正义斗争，直到打败美国侵略者，取得最后胜利。我们相信，越南南方解放武装力量和南越人民的斗争必将取得最后胜利，越南人民要求祖国统一的愿望必将实现。
