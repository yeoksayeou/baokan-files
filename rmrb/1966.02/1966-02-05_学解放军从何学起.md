    What to Learn From the People's Liberation Army

    Comrade Han Wen suggests: There are many difficulties in doing ideological and political work in rural areas. Although we very much want to learn the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army, we are hampered by different conditions and cannot learn.

    Can the ideological and political work experience of the People's Liberation Army really be learned in rural areas? How to overcome some of the difficult conditions in rural areas? We hope comrades will express their opinions and introduce their experiences in doing ideological and political work in rural areas.　　Editor

    The political work experience of the People's Liberation Army is very rich, complete, and systematic. It holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adheres to the "Four Firsts," carries forward the "Three-Eight Work Style," truly puts politics in command, drives military work, and makes the People's Liberation Army an invincible armed force and a model for the people of the whole country to learn from.

    Now, rural cadres are also learning from the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army. However, in our learning and practice, we often feel that the problem is not so simple. Because the People's Liberation Army has good conditions for doing political work, which cannot be compared with those in local areas. Therefore, many good experiences of the People's Liberation Army cannot be learned in local areas. For example, the target of the People's Liberation Army's political work is the vast number of soldiers, who have good backgrounds and are young, and are relatively easy to accept new ideas and new things; while the main target of rural political work is the vast number of peasants, and a village is a microcosm of society, and the situation is very complex, including not only people of different classes, but also men, women, old and young. Also, the conditions of cadres doing political work at the grassroots level in the People's Liberation Army are much stronger than those in local areas. Take a company as an example, the company instructor has been receiving Party education for a long time, hears many reports, and reads many documents, which is difficult for rural cadres to compare with. The Party branch secretary of a rural brigade has to grasp production and ideology, and manage everything, how can he compare with a full-time company instructor?

    Under normal circumstances, the troops ensure that they have a certain amount of time every day to study politics, such as reading Chairman Mao's works, reading newspapers, holding meetings to discuss, and so on. But what about the countryside? Commune members are busy with production all year round, and female commune members have to feed pigs, cook, and take care of children when they go home, there are enough tasks. Moreover, rural residences are scattered, and the eating times of each family are inconsistent, so convening a meeting often means this one waiting for that one, and that one waiting for this one. In short, rural conditions are special, and although the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army is good, we can only sigh in vain and suffer from not being able to learn it.

    学解放军从何学起
    韩文同志提出：农村做思想政治工作有许多困难，虽然很想把解放军的政治工作经验学到手，但苦于条件不同，无法学习。
    农村到底能不能把解放军的思想政治工作经验学到手？农村的一些困难条件如何克服？希望同志们发表意见，并介绍做好农村思想政治工作的经验。　　编者
    人民解放军的政治工作经验很丰富很完整很系统，它高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚持四个第一，发扬三八作风，真正作到政治挂帅，带动了军事工作，使解放军成为一支战无不胜的武装力量，成为全国人民学习的榜样。
    现在，农村干部也在学习解放军的政治工作经验。但是，我们在学习和实践中，往往感到问题不那么简单。因为解放军做政治工作的条件好，这是地方上的条件不能相比的，因此，解放军的许多好经验地方上学不了。比如，解放军做政治工作的对象是广大战士，他们出身好，又年青，接受新思想新事物比较容易；而农村政治工作的主要对象是广大农民，一个村庄就是一个社会的缩影，情况很复杂，不仅有不同阶级的人，而且包括男女老幼。又如，解放军在基层做政治工作的干部条件也比地方上强得多。以连队来说吧，连指导员长期接受党的教育，报告听得多，文件也不少看，这是农村干部很难相比的。农村一个大队党支部书记，抓了生产，还要抓思想，大小事情都得管，同一个脱产的连队指导员如何相比呢？
    在通常情况下，部队保证每天有一定的时间用来学习政治，象读毛主席著作呀，读报呀，开会讨论呀等等。可是农村呢，社员们一年四季天天忙生产，女社员回家还要喂猪、做饭、照料孩子，事务是够多的了。还有，农村居住分散，各家吃饭时间也不一致，召开个会，经常是这个等那个，那个等这个。总之，农村条件特殊，解放军的政治工作经验虽然好，可是我们只有望洋兴叹，苦于无法学到手。
