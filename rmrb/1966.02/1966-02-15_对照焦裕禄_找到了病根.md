    Comparing myself to Jiao Yulu, I Found the Root of My Problem
    This is because I lack Jiao Yulu's selfless revolutionary spirit of "having all the people in his heart, and only himself not," and lack Jiao Yulu's deep class feelings of being connected to the working people by flesh and blood.
    Studying the exemplary deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, my heart has been unable to calm down for a long time. The more I learn, the greater the gap I feel; the more I learn, the more I feel I must invigorate myself, catch up quickly, and strengthen my self-transformation in order to keep up with the situation and live up to the trust and expectations of the Party and the people.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu is worthy of being a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong. He went to Lankao County with an illness, and went to the countryside the next day. In more than a year, he visited almost all the brigades in the county. I have been in Tong County for eight years, but I have rarely truly gone deep into the masses and practiced the "Three Togethers"; when I went down, it was by car, just a quick glance. Comrade Jiao Yulu thought that "馍 chewed by others has no taste," and personally conducted investigations and research, discovered and cultivated four role models, and enthusiastically promoted them, enabling the role models to exert infinite power. I am satisfied with listening to reports from grassroots cadres, thinking that the situation is clear, and I have never personally dissected a sparrow, let alone discovered and cultivated a model among the more than five hundred brigades' public security committees and a large number of police officers, even though there are many good experiences at the grassroots level. At the time when the heavy snow blocked the door and the masses were in difficulty, Comrade Jiao Yulu endured the pain and personally ran to the bedsides of poor and lower-middle peasants to ask about their well-being, delivering the care of the Party and Chairman Mao to the hearts of the masses, greatly inspiring the masses to overcome difficulties. When I encountered strong winds and heavy rains, I only proceeded from the perspective of the task and organized cadres to go down to check the safety of the houses, but I did not personally check a single room. During the difficult period of the people of Lankao, he held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carried out verbal education on the basis of personal example, leading the people of the county to face difficulties. During the difficult period, I could not lead by example, caring more about my own health than caring about the masses. He devoted himself to serving the people and made outstanding achievements in his work. When he was dying, he still did not forget the people, and said that he had not completed the task assigned by the Party. I am far behind him, but I still always feel that my work is done well, my achievements are not small, I am proud and complacent, I like to hear praise, and I don't like criticism. Although I have never openly reached out to the Party and the people for status or treatment, I secretly compared my position with comrades who joined the revolution at the same time. Because of personal distractions, I cannot wholeheartedly serve the people. In the past, I also checked that my work was not in-depth enough, thinking that I was too busy and had too many things to do, so I couldn't go down, and I also admitted that I was a little afraid of hardship. In front of the tall image of Jiao Yulu, I realized that the root is not here, but in my lack of his selfless revolutionary spirit of "having all the people in his heart, and only himself not," and the lack of his deep class feelings of being connected to the working people by flesh and blood. This is the root of my problem.
    He and I are the same age. I am ashamed to say that I joined the revolution earlier than him. So, why has my class feeling for the working people become weaker and weaker? If it is said that it is because I have been eroded by bourgeois ideology, then why can he be "immune" even though he also lives in a sharp and complex class struggle environment? After thinking about it, the most fundamental reason is: I have not read Chairman Mao's books with such a high degree of consciousness as he did, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. This is the most fundamental difference. Through study, I feel very ashamed, and at the same time, I feel greatly encouraged. I am determined to take him as an example, go to the countryside with Chairman Mao's works, move the office to the kang head and livestock shed of poor and lower-middle peasants, work and struggle with the masses, and study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice, and transform myself into a good fighter like Jiao Yulu.

### 对照焦裕禄　找到了病根

    对照焦裕禄　找到了病根
    这就是自己缺乏焦裕禄的那种“心里装着全体人民，唯独没有自己”的忘我革命精神；缺乏焦裕禄的那种和劳动人民血肉相联的深厚阶级感情
    学习焦裕禄同志的模范事迹，心情久久不能平静，越学越感到差距大，越学越感到必须振奋起来，急起直追，加强自我改造，才能赶上形势，才能不辜负党和人民的委托和期望。
    焦裕禄同志不愧为毛泽东同志的好学生。他带病到兰考县去，第二天就下乡，一年多几乎走遍了全县所有的大队。我到通县已八年了，却很少真正深入群众，实行三同；下去也是车来车去，走马观花。焦裕禄同志嫌“别人嚼过的馍没味道”，亲自进行调查研究；发现和培养了四个榜样，满腔热情地为它们鸣锣开道，使榜样发挥了无穷的力量。我却满足于听听基层干部的汇报就算情况明了，从未亲自动手，解剖麻雀，更不曾在全县五百多个大队的治保会和大批民警中，亲自发现和培养一个样板，尽管基层也有不少好的经验。焦裕禄同志在大雪封门群众困难的时刻，忍着病痛，亲自跑到贫农下中农床头问寒问饥，把党和毛主席的关怀送到群众的心上，极大地鼓舞了群众战胜困难的斗志。我逢到大风大雨，只是从任务观点出发，组织干部下去检查房屋安危，自己却连一间也没有亲自检查一下。他在兰考人民困难时期，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在身教的基础上进行言教，率领全县人民迎着困难而上。我在困难时期却不能以身作则，关心自己身体甚于关心群众。他为人民鞠躬尽瘁，工作做出了十分出色的成绩，临终时还念念不忘人民，还说自己没有完成党交给的任务。我比他差得远，却还总觉得自己工作搞得不错，成绩不小，骄傲自满，爱听表扬，不喜批评。我虽然不曾公开伸手向党、向人民要地位闹待遇，但思想上却暗自和同时参加革命的同志比名位。由于有个人杂念，就作不到全心全意为人民服务。过去也曾检查自己工作还不深入，认为是工作忙、事情多，所以下不去，也承认自己有些怕艰苦。在焦裕禄的高大形象面前，我认识到根子不在这里，而在于我缺乏他那种“心里装着全体人民，唯独没有自己”的忘我革命精神，缺乏他那种和劳动人民血肉相联的深厚阶级感情。这就是我的病根所在。
    我和他恰是同岁，说来惭愧，我参加革命还比他早，那么，为什么我同劳动人民的阶级感情却越来越淡薄下去了呢？如果说是因为受了资产阶级思想的侵蚀，那么，为什么他同样生活在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争环境中却能够“免疫”呢？想来想去，最根本的原因还在于：我不曾象他那样高度自觉地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事。这是最根本的差距。通过学习，我感到十分惭愧，同时也感到莫大的鼓舞。我下决心以他为榜样，带着毛主席著作下乡，把办公地点搬到贫农下中农炕头、牲口棚边，和群众共同劳动共同斗争，在实践中活学活用毛泽东思想，把自己改造成一个焦裕禄式的好战士。
