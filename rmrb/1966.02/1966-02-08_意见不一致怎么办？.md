Title: What to Do When Opinions Differ?

    We are engaged in rural work. It's impossible to have everyone happy with everything from the start. There will always be people who don't understand, who oppose, even who point their fingers and scold us. The ten fingers on your hand aren't all the same length; some are long, some are short. How can people all be the same? If everyone were immediately happy and there weren't any dissenting opinions, I think we'd have to think it over carefully, as it might not necessarily be a good thing.

    It's common and reasonable to have contradictions and disagreements. The important thing is what to do when you encounter this situation. Should we adopt a method of coercion and suppression? Or should we adopt a method of full discussion, persuasion, and education? According to our work experience, the latter method is better than the former. Take well-digging in our village, for example. Digging wells to combat drought is a good thing, but at the beginning, some people opposed it, saying, "Ninety percent of our village's land is already irrigated. What's the point of digging wells? It's purely wasting manpower and money." We let everyone discuss it fully, letting all the different opinions be expressed. Then, we explained to the masses that water conservancy should not only focus on surface water, but also on groundwater, preparing two sets of systems to ensure a good harvest even in drought years. Furthermore, we should do more water conservancy to support the brotherly brigades. This is our duty at Yiduhe. When the masses understood this principle, they stopped opposing and scolding us, and even actively rushed to work! If we forced people to agree and insisted that they do it, it would inevitably lead to a forced melon not being sweet, turning a good thing into a bad one.

    When holding meetings for discussion, we must let people speak, let them finish speaking. If one meeting isn't enough, hold more, three or five times. If they still don't understand, we must wait patiently. We must let the minority's words, the opposing words, the harsh words, the unpleasant words, be said completely and sufficiently. Don't let the flames of anger rise too high when you hear some dissenting opinions, making you unable to listen. If you don't listen to the minority's opinions at this meeting, who will speak at future meetings? They won't say anything even if they have opinions. Some opposing opinions, if we carefully ponder them, can be very beneficial. Last spring, the drought was very severe. Most people didn't advocate planting corn. A minority said, "If it doesn't rain in the spring, rain will come eventually. It's better to plant a little than to leave the land idle." We consulted with the old peasants, and they all said, "Okay, plant it!" We planted corn according to the minority's opinion, and the autumn harvest was quite good. At that time, if we had simply followed the majority's opinion, how much less would we have harvested?

    When there's discussion, there will inevitably be debate, some right, some wrong. If it's right, everyone should follow it; if it's wrong, it should be corrected. To achieve this, we must dare to uphold the truth, correct mistakes, and take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. According to our experience, it is particularly necessary to regularly carry out "small rectification campaigns" to use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism well. If Party members have shortcomings and mistakes, regardless of how long they've been in the Party or how great their work achievements are, they should be examined at the "small rectification" meetings according to the principle of "merit not outweighing demerit," face to face, drumming up criticism and self-criticism. Whether it's in thought, production, work, or style, anyone who has opinions about anyone else can lay them out for criticism. The more you hold these criticism meetings, the more accustomed everyone will become. If you never hold them, and then suddenly hold one, it's not easy to get everyone to engage in criticism! Pay the bills (problems) of that month in that month, and don't wait for the end of the year to settle the accounts. In this way, everyone becomes accustomed to it.

    When there is debate, the Party branch secretary should avoid drawing conclusions too early. They must allow the branch committee members to fully express their opinions, speaking openly and arguing clearly. Don't have the secretary speak, then everyone flatter a few words, and then decide. This way, the work cannot be done well. No matter who it is, if they are right, it counts, and you have to do what they say. For example, the suggestion to plant corn in the spring of 1964 was put forward by a relatively backward Party member. This opinion was very good, so we adopted it. If only the secretary's nod counted, who would be willing to offer opinions in the future? In addition to setting an example himself, the secretary must fully utilize the roles of the committee members. Here, everyone speaks at the branch committee meetings. It's not that the person in charge of pigs only talks about pigs, and doesn't say anything else. Everyone is concerned about the overall work. In this way, everyone has responsibility for the decisions made. It's not that they nod in agreement in the meeting room, and then shake their heads as soon as they leave, taking credit for the good things and pushing the blame for the problems onto others, saying it was the secretary's idea. Sometimes, in order to unify everyone's opinions, a branch meeting must be held repeatedly, several times. In the spring of 1961, the Party branch studied how to cultivate the marginal land. At that time, there were differences of opinion. After seven branch meetings, the divergent opinions were unified, and everyone unanimously agreed to cultivate the wasteland collectively.

    It's not enough to just hold meetings for discussion. Some things, especially things related to production, need to be shown in practice for people to be convinced. Chairman Mao told us that everything must be done through experimentation. I think conducting experiments, demonstrations, visits, and holding on-site meetings are all good ways, neither resorting to coercion nor becoming a tail of the masses. The peasant masses value practicality the most; seeing is believing. No matter how well you say it, if they haven't seen it, they won't be convinced. Before 1958, our village had to eat more than 200,000 jin of state grain every year. At that time, we proposed not eating state grain. Some people opposed, saying, "It's okay not to eat state grain, but we have to cut down all the trees in our village." We didn't cut down the trees, and started experimenting with planting crops under the trees. The experiment was successful, and both grain and fruit yielded a good harvest. No one said to cut down trees for grain anymore. Also, there were many people who opposed pruning and spraying the old pear trees that had not produced fruit for many years. We left a few of the 180-plus pear trees unmanaged for comparison. This year, the managed trees were laden with so much fruit that the branches broke, while the unmanaged trees remained the same, without any fruit. Many people were convinced, but some still said, "This is just because it was a good year." Then we managed them according to the new technology for several years in a row, and got the same results. This time, everyone was convinced and accepted the new technology.

    To do a good job, in addition to the cadres and Party members being good at listening to different opinions, the key lies in the actions of the cadres, especially the branch committee members. Once the discussion is clear, we must take action. It's not enough to just talk without practicing. How to do it? The branch committee members and cadres of various departments must coordinate their actions, each taking responsibility. If there are problems, they should be reported; if there are no problems, they should be handled separately. Just like Chairman Mao instructed: we must learn to "play the piano."

    意见不一致怎么办？
    北京市怀柔县北宅公社一渡河大队党支部书记　刘宗悦
    我们搞农村工作，不论干什么事情，一开始就要所有的人都乐意，不可能，开头总有人不通，有人反对，甚至有人指着鼻子骂我们。十个指头伸出来不一般齐，有长有短，人哪能都是一样的？若是所有的人一下子都乐意了，一点意见都没有，我看倒要好好思索思索，也不一定就是好事。
    有矛盾，不统一，是常见的，是合乎情理的，要紧的是遇到这种情况怎么办？是采取强制压服的办法？还是采取充分讨论说服教育的办法？根据我们工作的经验来看，后一种办法比前一种办法好。就拿我们村打井来说，打井抗旱本来是件好事，可是，开头也有人反对说：“咱们村百分之九十的地都浇上水了，还打井干什么，这纯粹是劳民伤财”。我们让大家充分讨论，把不同的意见都讲出来，然后，再向群众说明，搞水利不能只搞地上水，还要搞地下水，准备两套，作到有备无患，保证旱年也丰产；再说，我们多搞点水利，支援兄弟大队，这是我们一渡河的义务。当群众明白了这个道理，就不反对、不骂我们了，还积极抢着干哩！要是强制人家通，硬要人家干，势必要造成强拧的瓜不甜，把好事办成坏事。
    开会讨论，就要让人家讲话，让人家把话讲完。一次会不行，就多开几次，三次、五次，实在不通，也要耐心地等一等。少数人的话，反对的话，刺耳的话，难听的话，都要让人家说完，说充分；不要听见一些不同意见，就火苗窜起多高，听不进去。这次会上你不听少数人的意见，以后再开会谁还说话呀？有意见也不言语了。有些反面意见，只要我们仔细琢磨琢磨，也是很有好处的。再说，少数人的看法，出的主意，不一定不正确。去年春天，旱的很厉害，多数人不主张种棒子，少数人说：“春天不下雨，下雨就是春，抢种一点，总比闲着地板好”。我们访问了老农，都说：行，种吧！我们按照少数人的意见抢种了棒子，秋后收成还不错。当时，要是简单地按照多数人的主张办事，得少收多少？
    要讨论就免不了有争论，有说对的，有说不对的。说对了大家就照着办，错了就改正。要做到这一点，就要敢于坚持真理、修正错误，拿起批评与自我批评的武器，错了就大胆地检查、改正。根据我们的体会，要用好批评与自我批评的武器，经常开展“小整风”是特别必要的。党员有了缺点和错误，不管党龄多长，工作成绩多大，都按“功不抵过”的原则，在“小整风”会上进行检查，当面锣，对面鼓，开展批评与自我批评。不论是思想、生产、工作、作风，谁对谁有什么意见，都可以摊开来进行批评。这种批评会开多了，习惯了就好了。老也不开，冷丁子开一次，要大家展开批评，不容易着哩！那个月的账（问题），就那个月还，不等年终算总账。这样一来，大家也都习惯了。
    有了争论，支部书记尽可能不早下结论，一定要让支委们充分地发表意见，敞开说，吵个清楚。不要书记说了，大家就奉承几句，就决定下来，这样工作没法做好。不管是谁，说对了，都算数，还要照着人家说的去办。比方说，一九六四年春抢种棒子的建议就是一个比较落后的党员提出来的。这个意见很好，我们就采纳了。要是光书记一个人点头才算数，以后谁还肯提意见？书记除了以身作则，做出样子来，还要充分发挥委员们的作用。我们这儿，开支委会大家都说话，不是管猪的只说猪，说别的就不言语；大家都关心全面工作。这样，做出的决定，大家都有责任，不是在屋里开会点头，一出门就摇脑袋，好事有一份，出了毛病就推说是别人弄的，是书记的主意。有时为了统一大家的意见，一个支部会要反复开几次。一九六一年春天，党支部研究怎样开十边地的问题，当时意见有分歧。先后召开了七次支部大会，分歧的意见才得到了统一，大家一致同意集体开荒。
    光开会讨论还不行，有些事情，特别是生产上的事情，还要拿出个样子来，人家才信服。毛主席告诉我们，一切都要通过试验。我看搞试验，示范，参观，开现场会都是个好办法，既不犯强迫命令，又不当群众尾巴。农民群众最讲实在，眼见为实，你说的再好，他没见过，也不信服。一九五八年以前，我们村每年都要吃国家二十多万斤粮食。那时，我们就提出不吃国家的粮食，有些人反对说：“不吃国家粮食也行，得把咱们村的树都砍了。”我们没有砍树，开始试着在树底下种庄稼。试验成功了，粮果都丰收，再也没有人说砍树种粮了。还有，对多年不结果的鸭梨树实行剪枝、打药的问题，也有许多人反对。我们在一百八十多棵鸭梨树中留下了几棵不加管理，进行对比。这一年经过整理的树挂的果很多，都把树枝压断了，没整理的树还是老样子，没挂果。许多人都信服了，可是还有人说：“这是碰上好年头了。”接着我们又按新技术一连管理了几年，都得到了同样的结果，这一回大家心服口服了，接受了这项新技术。
    要搞好工作，除了干部、党员善于听取不同意见以外，关键还在干部们的行动，特别是支委们的行动。讨论清楚了，就要干起来，光说不练不行。怎么干？支委们，各部门干部要协同动作，都负起责任来，有问题就反映，没问题就分头去办。就象毛主席指示的那样：要学会“弹钢琴”。
