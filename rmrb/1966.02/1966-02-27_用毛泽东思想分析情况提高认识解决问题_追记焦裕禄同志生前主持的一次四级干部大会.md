Editor's Note: There are several ways to arrange work through meetings. One is to only assign work tasks without explaining the methods. This lazy approach is now rare.

    Another is to assign work tasks, clarify policy boundaries, explain work methods, and point out precautions. This method is common and helpful to subordinates.

    Yet another is the method adopted by Comrade Jiao Yulu, as introduced in this article. At the work deployment meeting, he first mobilized everyone to study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong with problems in mind, to find stance, viewpoints, and methods from them. By reading Chairman Mao's books and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, all problems can be easily solved. Not only will directional errors like "only focusing on grain, cotton, and oil, without focusing on enemies, ourselves, and friends" not occur, but problems like "picking up sesame seeds while losing the watermelon" can also be avoided. This is highlighting politics, this is letting thought lead the way. We advocate this method.

    I had a very short period of time with Comrade Jiao Yulu.

    That was in November 1963. That autumn, Lankao County suffered another severe flood. In early November, the county party committee convened a county, commune, production brigade, and production team four-level cadre conference with more than two thousand participants to arrange production and disaster relief work for the winter and spring seasons, and to organize the masses to continue the fight against the "three harms" of wind, sand, alkali, and waterlogging. At that time, I followed Comrade Wang Xiangming, deputy director of the Kaifeng Prefectural Party Committee's Organization Department, to attend the conference, and spent twenty days with Comrade Jiao Yulu. I took notes on Comrade Jiao Yulu's reports and speeches at that meeting. I still keep these notebooks. Although the time I spent with Comrade Jiao Yulu was short, his revolutionary spirit, working methods, and excellent style left a deep impression on me.

    "In Times of Difficulty, We Must See the Light"

    "When our comrades are in difficulty, they must see the achievements, see the light, and increase our courage." At the enlarged meeting of the county party committee to study how to hold the conference, Comrade Jiao Yulu repeatedly read this passage from Chairman Mao to everyone.

    At that time, some party members and cadres had a feeling of being overwhelmed and lacked confidence in overcoming the "three harms." Comrade Jiao Yulu said, "This conference of ours must follow Chairman Mao's instructions to revitalize the revolutionary spirit of party members and cadres, dare to face difficulties, and fight our way through. In this way, our production and disaster relief and the fight against the 'three harms' this winter and spring will be easier to handle." Therefore, the county party committee decided that the meeting would first spend some time summarizing achievements, commending advanced individuals, encouraging enthusiasm, and establishing confidence. Comrade Jiao Yulu often went deep into various study groups and analyzed the situation with grassroots cadres. He said, "Although our county suffered a severe flood this autumn, which has added a lot of difficulties to our work, we must see the light in times of difficulty. We have many favorable conditions: the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the 360,000 hardworking and brave people, a more consolidated collective economy, and a group of good examples in the fight against disaster. Moreover, Lankao is an old disaster area, and cadres and the masses have experience in fighting disaster and providing relief... As long as we give full play to the active factors of people, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome." These words made the hearts of grassroots party members and cadres brighter.

    At the meeting of leading cadres of the county and communes, Comrade Jiao Yulu seriously criticized some people's fear of difficulties. He said, "In the face of difficulties, two kinds of people have two kinds of attitudes. One is to stand up and fight their way through. The more difficult it is, the more they forge ahead, turning difficulties into a driving force for progress. Overcoming a difficulty is a victory. Such comrades are good comrades. The other kind of people are overwhelmed by difficulties, pessimistic and disappointed, only seeing the difficulties, but not seeing the favorable conditions; they do not believe in the Party, do not believe in the masses, and do not believe in the collective economy. They have no energy in their work." He also said, "Being afraid of difficulties, afraid of revolution, not daring to fight, not daring to win, not fighting their way through, but muddling along, is a manifestation of a lack of proletarian firmness. It is shameful for a Communist Party member to have this kind of thinking."

    Comrade Jiao Yulu severely criticized some people's "middle-stream thinking." He said, "Some people say, 'The upstream is too hard, the downstream gets spanked, and the middle stream is the happiest.' They say, 'It doesn't matter if you get praised or not, as long as you are not criticized, you are lucky.' There are many fears in the minds of these people: fear of hardship, fear of tension, fear of making mistakes. They do their work calmly, unwilling to use their brains, unwilling to take action, unwilling to learn, and do not take notes at important meetings. These people have a half-baked understanding of the situation below, or only know without understanding, or do not know without understanding, parrot others, believe false things to be true, have no definite conclusions, and always estimate, approximate, or are just about right when answering questions. Is this doing revolution? No, this is not doing revolution, this is muddling through the revolution."

    How sharp and sincere was Comrade Jiao Yulu's criticism! Many comrades checked their own fear of difficulties and "middle-stream thinking," and mustered up revolutionary enthusiasm.

    "Cannot Rust Politically"

    After everyone's enthusiasm was roused, some comrades advocated arranging work immediately. Comrade Jiao Yulu asked the comrades attending the meeting to study Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind, to uncover the class struggle surrounding production and disaster relief, and to conduct a major debate to further clarify the direction and path forward. He said, "We cannot rust politically, we cannot only focus on production and disaster relief without focusing on class struggle; we cannot only focus on grain, cotton, and oil without focusing on enemies, ourselves, and friends." Comrade Wang Xiangming, deputy director of the Kaifeng Prefectural Party Committee's Organization Department, expressed his support for this view at the time.

    Therefore, the second stage of the conference turned to studying Chairman Mao's works extensively, uncovering the lid of class struggle, and conducting a major debate. In the study and discussion, Comrade Jiao Yulu used typical examples to enlighten everyone to compare the two different experiences of poor and lower-middle peasants in disaster years in the old and new societies, and to accuse the old society, so that everyone clearly realized that adhering to the socialist road, relying on the collective economy, self-reliance, and hard struggle, we can completely overcome disasters. At this conference, Comrade Jiao Yulu also greatly praised "the spirit of Hancun, the determination of Qinzhai, the drive of Zhaoduolou, and the path of Shuangyangshu." Each commune also established a batch of such good examples. These good examples, like red stars, shone brightly at the meeting, illuminating people's eyes. The comrades attending the conference were greatly invigorated, and many moving deeds emerged. The fifteen cadres from Wangzhuang Brigade of Nanzhang Commune who attended the meeting found nine ways to engage in sideline production. They believed that relying on the superiority of the collective economy, these sideline productions could solve their own problems of eating and burning for the entire winter and spring. A cadre from a brigade proposed to the county party committee that their forage grass was relatively abundant and they were willing to contract to raise one hundred head of livestock for brother teams with severe disaster situations. The county party committee also received an unsigned letter from a Communist Youth League member, with forty yuan and ten jin of grain coupons enclosed in the envelope. The letter read: "Dear leaders: Please give this humble expression of my heart to the class brothers who are suffering from the disaster!"

    "Leaving the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, Nothing Can Be Accomplished"

    With enthusiasm and a clear direction, who should we rely on to overcome the "three harms"? Comrade Jiao Yulu and others organized the comrades attending the meeting to study Chairman Mao's instructions on relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants. He said, "We Communists, in rural work, cannot accomplish anything without the poor and lower-middle peasants." He repeatedly explained the great significance of relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants to the commune secretaries. He also criticized those who did not rely on the thoughts and behaviors of the poor and lower-middle peasants. He said, "Some people do not conduct class analysis when things happen, and do not rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants in their work; in rural work, they do not enter the doors of poor peasants, do not listen to the words of poor peasants, do not hold meetings of poor peasants, do not eat the food of poor peasants, do not live in the homes of poor peasants, do not understand what difficulties the poor and lower-middle peasants have in their production and life, or are indifferent when they see them, without class feelings." He asked the commune secretaries: "Have you discovered that some poor peasants are having difficulties in their lives? After discovering them, what did you think? Did you help them solve them? This is a matter of stance. How can you do a good job if you do not rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants in your work and do not care about the poor and lower-middle peasants in your life!"

    Personally Write a Mobilization Report

    Comrade Jiao Yulu kept a close grip on the ideological work of the leading cadres of the county and communes. During the meeting, he convened these cadres several times to study Chairman Mao's works and the instructions of the higher party committees. One night, the county party committee analyzed the ideological trends of the middle-level backbone at a heads-up meeting and decided that Comrade Jiao Yulu would give another mobilization report the next day. When the meeting ended, it was already 11:00 p.m., but Comrade Jiao Yulu endured the pain in his liver and sat down to personally draft the outline of the mobilization report. At first, I didn't know he drafted it. The next day at the meeting, I listened to his lively and touching speech, and asked a comrade in the office: "Who drafted this mobilization report by Lao Jiao?" He replied: "Comrade Jiao Yulu personally wrote it last night." He also said: "Comrade Jiao Yulu mostly writes his reports himself. Sometimes, when he is too busy with his work, he asks the comrades in the office to write on his behalf, but he always gives instructions in advance and then modifies it himself."

    "To Contribute Everything to Completely Change the Face of Lankao"

    In the final stage of the conference, work was arranged. Comrade Jiao Yulu organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." On behalf of the county party committee, he made a solemn request to the comrades: "Comrades! We serve the people wholeheartedly; serving the people is specific, not abstract. Lankao is our glorious work post, and we must do a good job in this area. The disaster situation in Lankao is so severe at present that we must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, have great revolutionary courage, soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, and a pragmatic work style, lead the broad masses, and contribute everything to overcome the 'three harms' of wind, sand, alkali, and waterlogging, and completely change the face of Lankao." Comrade Jiao Yulu said this and did this, and he dedicated his precious life to the people of Lankao.

    Comrade Jiao Yulu has passed away. But his noble communist spirit will live forever in the hearts of the people. I have made up my mind to always take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works creatively like him, to be unafraid of hardship and death like him, and to be wholeheartedly for the revolution and wholeheartedly for the people.

　　用毛泽东思想分析情况提高认识解决问题
　　——追记焦裕禄同志生前主持的一次四级干部大会
　　中共开封地委组织部　鹿文贵
    编者按：开会安排工作，可以有几种方法。一种是只布置工作任务，不交代工作方法。这样的懒办法，现在已经不多见了。
    一种是布置了工作任务，划清了政策界限，交代了工作方法，指明了注意事项。这样的办法是大量的，对下级是有帮助的。
    还有一种，就是本文介绍的焦裕禄同志所采取的方法。在布置工作的会上，先发动大家带着问题学毛泽东同志的著作，从中找立场，找观点，找方法。读毛主席的书，照毛主席的指示办事，一切问题就容易解决。不仅类似“只抓粮棉油，不抓敌我友”的方向性错误不会发生，类似“抓了芝麻，丢了西瓜”的问题也能避免。这就是突出政治，这就是思想先行。我们提倡这种方法。
    我曾经和焦裕禄同志相处过很短的一段时间。
    那是一九六三年十一月。这年秋季，兰考县又遭受了严重的涝灾。十一月上旬，县委召开了一个两千多人参加的县、公社、生产大队、生产队四级干部大会，安排冬春两季的生产救灾工作，组织群众继续向风沙、盐碱、内涝“三害”进军。那时，我跟随开封地委组织部副部长王向明同志去参加大会，和焦裕禄同志相处了二十天。焦裕禄同志在那次会上的报告、发言，我作了记录。这些笔记本，我至今还保存着。那次和焦裕禄同志相处的时间虽然很短，但是他的革命精神、工作方法和优良作风，却给我留下了深刻的印象。
    “在困难的时候，要看到光明”
    “我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”在县委扩大会议研究大会的开法时，焦裕禄同志向大家反复地宣读了毛主席的这一段话。
    当时，部分党员和干部产生了畏难情绪，对战胜“三害”缺乏信心。焦裕禄同志说：“我们这次大会，必须按照毛主席的指示，使党员和干部的革命精神振作起来，敢于迎着困难，战斗着过去。这样，我们今冬明春的生产救灾和除‘三害’斗争就好办了。”因此，县委决定，会议首先拿出一段时间，总结成绩，表扬先进，鼓舞干劲，树立信心。焦裕禄同志经常深入各个学习小组，同基层干部一起分析形势。他说：“今年秋季，咱县虽然遭受严重涝灾，给我们的工作增加了很多困难；但是，我们在困难的时候，要看到光明。我们的有利条件很多：有党中央和毛主席的领导，有三十六万勤劳勇敢的人民，集体经济更加巩固，有了一批抗灾斗争的好榜样。还有，兰考是老灾区，干部和群众都有抗灾救灾的经验……。只要我们充分发挥人的积极因素，再大的困难也能克服。”他的这些话使基层党员干部的心更亮堂了。
    在县和公社的领导干部会议上，焦裕禄同志严肃批评了一些人的畏难情绪。他说：“在困难面前，两种人抱两种态度。一种是站起来，斗争过去，越是困难越往前闯，把困难当成前进的动力，克服一个困难就是一个胜利。这样的同志才是好同志。另一种人是困难压头，悲观失望，只看到困难，看不到有利条件；他们不相信党，不相信群众，不相信集体经济，干起工作来没有劲头。”他又说：“怕困难，怕革命，不敢斗争，不敢胜利，不是战斗着过去，而是得过且过，这是缺乏无产阶级坚定性的表现。一个共产党员有这种思想，那是可耻的。”
    焦裕禄同志狠狠地批评了一些人的“中游思想”。他说：“有的人说什么‘上游太辛苦，下游打屁股，中游最幸福。’说什么‘表扬不表扬没关系，只要不批评就是福气。’这种人的脑子中存在着很多怕字，怕艰苦，怕紧张，怕犯错误，做起工作来平平静静，不愿动脑筋，不愿动手，不愿学习，重要的会议也不记笔记。这种人对下情一知半解，或者只知不解，或者不知不解，人云亦云，信假为真，没有肯定的结论，回答问题总是估计、大概、差不多。这是干革命吗？不，这不是干革命，这是混革命。”
    焦裕禄同志的批评多么尖锐，多么诚恳！不少同志都对照检查了自己的畏难情绪和“中游思想”，鼓起了革命干劲。
    “不能在政治上生锈”
    大家的劲鼓起来以后，有的同志主张接着就安排工作。焦裕禄同志则要求到会同志带着问题学习毛主席著作，大揭生产救灾上的阶级斗争盖子，开展大辩论，进一步明确前进方向和道路。他说：“我们不能在政治上生锈，不能只抓生产救灾，不抓阶级斗争；不能只抓粮、棉、油，不抓敌、我、友。”开封地委组织部副部长王向明同志，当时表示支持他的这个意见。
    于是，大会的第二阶段，就转入了大学毛主席著作，大揭阶级斗争盖子，大辩论。在学习和讨论中，焦裕禄同志用典型事例，启发大家对比新旧社会灾荒年头贫农下中农的两种不同遭遇，控诉旧社会，使大家明确地认识到，坚持社会主义道路，依靠集体经济，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，完全可以战胜灾荒。在这次大会上，焦裕禄同志又大大表扬了“韩村的精神，秦寨的决心，赵垛楼的干劲，双杨树的道路”。各公社也都树起了一批这样的好典型。这些好榜样，象一颗颗红星一样，在会上大放光明，照亮了人们的眼睛。参加大会的同志精神大振，出现了很多动人的事迹。南彰公社王庄大队到会的十五名干部，找到了九种副业生产门路。他们认为依靠集体经济的优越性，开展这些副业生产，一冬一春吃的烧的都可以自己解决。有一个大队的干部向县委提出，他们的饲草比较多，愿意给灾情大的兄弟队包养一百头牲口。县委还收到了一个没有署名的共青团员的来信，信封中装了四十元人民币、十斤粮票。这封信中写道：“亲爱的领导：请把我这点微薄的心意交给受灾的阶级兄弟吧！”
    “离开了贫农下中农，什么事情也做不成”
    干劲有了，方向也明确了，那么，依靠谁来战胜“三害”呢？焦裕禄同志等又组织到会的同志学习毛主席有关依靠贫农下中农的指示。他说：“我们共产党人，在农村工作，离开了贫农下中农，什么事情也做不成。”他对公社书记们反复讲解了依靠贫农下中农的伟大意义。他还批评了那些不依靠贫农下中农的思想行为。他说：“有些人，遇事不进行阶级分析，在工作中不依靠贫农下中农；在农村工作，不进贫农门，不听贫农话，不开贫农会，不吃贫农饭，不住贫农家，不了解贫农下中农在生产生活上有些什么困难，或者看到了无动于衷，没有阶级感情。”他问公社书记们：“有的贫农生活困难，你们发现了没有？发现以后你们是怎样想的？帮助他们解决了没有？这是个立场问题。工作上不依靠贫农下中农，生活上不关心贫农下中农，怎么能把工作做好呢！”
    自己亲自动手写动员报告
    焦裕禄同志对县和公社领导干部的思想工作抓得很紧。会议期间，他几次专门召集这些干部开会，学习毛主席著作和上级党委的指示。有一天晚上，县委碰头会上分析了中层骨干的思想动向，决定第二天由焦裕禄同志再作一次动员报告。散会时，已经是夜间十一点钟了，焦裕禄同志又忍着肝疼，坐下来亲自动手起草动员报告提纲。开始，我不知道是他起草的。第二天会上，我听着他讲得很生动，很感人，便问办公室一位同志：“老焦这个动员报告是谁起草的？”他回答：“是焦裕禄同志昨天夜间亲自动手写的。”他还说：“焦裕禄同志作报告，大都是他亲自写。有时候，他工作太忙了，才让办公室的同志代笔，但他总是事先授意，后自己修改。”
    “为彻底改变兰考面貌，贡献自己的一切”
    大会的最后阶段，安排了工作。焦裕禄同志又组织大家学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》。他代表县委向同志们提出了庄严的要求：“同志们！我们是全心全意为人民服务的；为人民服务是具体的，而不是抽象的。兰考是我们光荣的工作岗位，必须在这个地区做好工作。当前兰考的灾情如此严重，我们必须按毛主席的指示办事，要有伟大的革命胆略，冲天的革命干劲和实事求是的工作作风，带领广大群众，为战胜风沙、盐碱、内涝‘三害’，彻底改变兰考面貌，贡献自己的一切。”焦裕禄同志是这样说的，也是这样做的，他为兰考人民献出了自己的宝贵生命。
    焦裕禄同志与世长辞了。而他那高尚的共产主义精神将永远活在人民的心中。我已下定决心，要永远以焦裕禄同志为榜样，象他那样活学活用毛主席著作，象他那样不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民。
