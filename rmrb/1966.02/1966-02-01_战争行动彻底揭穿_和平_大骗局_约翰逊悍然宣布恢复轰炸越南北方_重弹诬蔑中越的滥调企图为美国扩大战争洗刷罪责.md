    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 31st: U.S. President Johnson issued a statement on the 31st, brazenly announcing the resumption of bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Johnson said, "This morning, Monday, at my direction and after consultation with and the agreement of the Government of South Vietnam (referring to the puppet regime), American aircraft resumed actions against North Vietnam. They struck supply lines…."
    The statement admits that the U.S. government took this naked act of aggression because its meticulously planned "peace offensive" had gone bankrupt. The statement said that although the U.S. government had made "the most intensive and determined efforts" to peddle its "peace talks" fraud, these efforts had "not succeeded" and had "accomplished nothing."
    The statement then used the robber logic that the U.S. imperialists habitually use, trying to portray the U.S. government as seeking "peace" and that it was not the U.S. but the Vietnamese people who were carrying out aggression, attempting to shift the responsibility for resuming the bombing onto the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and even China, and to whitewash the U.S.'s crimes of expanding the war. The statement said that in the past thirty-seven days, the U.S. government had been trying to "persuade the Government of Hanoi that peace is better than war, negotiation is better than fighting, and that the road to peace is open," but "our efforts... have not met with understanding and support from Hanoi and Peking. From these two capitals there has been only condemnation and rejection." He shamelessly said, "Now the whole world knows more clearly than ever before who is persisting in aggression and who is dedicated to peace," and slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for "persisting in aggression."
    However, Johnson's own words in the statement exposed what the so-called "peace" of the United States really was. The statement clamored that in South Vietnam, the "strength" of U.S. troops, the troops of U.S. satellite countries, and the South Vietnamese puppet army "is growing," and that "they are entitled to the full support of American strength and American determination. Both of these we must and shall provide." The statement also threatened that,
  "Those who direct and supply the aggression are not entitled to immunity from military response"; "The cost in lives for Vietnamese (referring to the South Vietnamese puppet army) and Americans would only be greatly increased if all support for North Vietnamese aggression continues to be given immunity. In view of the words and deeds of the Government in Hanoi, our clear responsibility lies in doing all we can to limit such sacrifice."
    The statement revealed that the U.S. will continue to play the strategy of alternating between "peace" and "war." The statement said, "The end of the pause (in bombing) does not mean the end of our own pursuit of peace. The pursuit of peace will be as firm and unrelenting as our military strength is applied on the battlefield."
    Although the whole world knows that the United Nations has no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue, Johnson finally announced in the statement that he "has instructed Ambassador Goldberg (U.S. Representative to the United Nations) to request an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council. He will submit a comprehensive report on the situation in Vietnam and propose a proposal that can open the road to the negotiating table."

    战争行动彻底揭穿“和平”大骗局
    约翰逊悍然宣布恢复轰炸越南北方
    重弹诬蔑中越的滥调企图为美国扩大战争洗刷罪责
    新华社三十一日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊三十一日发表声明，悍然宣布恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸。约翰逊说，“在今天星期一上午，根据我的指示，并在同南越政府（指傀儡政权）进行磋商并得到同意后，美国飞机恢复了在北越的行动。它们袭击了供应线……。”
    声明承认，美国政府采取这个赤裸裸的侵略行动，是由于它精心策划的“和平攻势”已经破产。声明说，尽管美国政府“作了最紧张的和最坚决的努力”来兜售它的“和谈”骗局，但是这些努力都“没有成功”，“毫无成就”。
    声明接着就使用美帝国主义者惯用的强盗逻辑，竭力把美国政府说成是谋求“和平”的，进行侵略的不是美国而是越南人民，企图借此把恢复轰炸的责任推到越南民主共和国以至中国身上，为美国扩大战争的罪行洗刷。声明说，在过去的三十七天中，美国政府一直设法“说服河内政府：和平比战争好、谈判比战斗好，走向和平的道路是敞开的”，但是“我们的努力……没有取得河内和北京的谅解和支持。来自这两个首都的只是谴责和拒绝”。他恬不知耻地说什么“现在全世界已经比以前任何时候更为清楚地知道，谁在坚持侵略，谁在致力于和平”，并且诬蔑越南民主共和国“坚持进行侵略”。
    但是约翰逊在声明里以自己的言词揭穿了美国的所谓“和平”到底是什么货色。声明叫嚷，在南越，美国部队，美国仆从国的军队和南越伪军的“力量正在日益增长”，“他们有权得到美国的力量和美国的决心的充分支持。这两样我们都一定要提供。”声明还威胁说，
  “那些对侵略进行指挥和提供供应的人无权不受军事回答”；“如果对支持北越侵略的一切继续给以豁免权的话，越南人
  （指南越伪军）和美国人付出的生命代价只会大大增加。鉴于河内政府的言行，我们的清楚的责任就是做我们所能做的一切来限制这种牺牲。”
    声明透露，美国将继续玩弄“和”“战”两手交替使用的策略。声明说，“暂停（轰炸）的结束并不意味着我们自己谋求和平的结束。谋求和平将同我们的军事力量在战场上施加压力一样是坚定和始终不懈的”。
    尽管全世界都知道，联合国根本无权过问越南问题，但是，约翰逊在声明中最后宣布，他“已经指示（美国驻联合国代表）戈德堡大使要求举行联合国安全理事会紧急会议。他将就越南局势提出一个全面报告，并且提出一项可以打开通向谈判桌的道路的提案。”
