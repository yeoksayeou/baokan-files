    Exposing the treacherous face of false support and true surrender at the disarmament conference
    The Soviet representative dared not utter a word against the US resuming bombing
    Repeatedly begged the US not to let the Vietnam issue affect the Soviet-US nuclear deal
    Albanian "People's Voice" condemned Soviet revisionism for encouraging new US adventures in Vietnam
    Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd dispatch: Geneva news: The mild reaction of the Soviet representative, Zorin, at the Geneva 17-Nation Disarmament Conference after the US flagrantly resumed bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam surprised Western officials and reporters present. According to a France-Presse reporter on the 1st, "Observers had expected the Soviet representative to make fierce verbal attacks on US policy in Vietnam, but he did not ask to speak." The report said, "Contrary to everyone's expectations, the Soviet chief representative, Zorin, remained silent about the US resumption of bombing of North Vietnam."
    On the contrary, Zorin, when talking to reporters that day, was indifferent to the robber behavior of the United States, and instead of dealing with the Vietnam issue, was single-mindedly trying to reach an agreement with the United States on "preventing nuclear proliferation" and other agreements that betray the interests of the people. He said, "I have said that the two issues of Vietnam and our (disarmament) negotiations should not be linked together."
    Agence France-Presse pointed out in its report on the disarmament conference that day, "The US chief representative, Foster, was prepared to answer the attacks expected to be launched by the Soviet Union. When he saw that Zorin did not intend to speak, he also remained silent."
    British representative Chalfont said triumphantly that the meeting that day was held "in a cooperative and friendly atmosphere," and he was "extremely pleased" with this.
    According to UPI, the Soviet side "made an unexpectedly mild response at the disarmament conference today to the US resumption of bombing of North Vietnam. Western officials said that this calm reflection was 'a good sign,' especially since Soviet negotiator Zorin did not speak at all." Agence France-Presse reported, "Western representatives believe that the Soviet Union's apparent conciliatory attitude is unexpectedly good, and they hope that this means that the Soviet Union is gradually softening its position, thereby opening the road to reaching an agreement on stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons..."
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 1st telegram: The Albanian "People's Voice" published an article on the 1st, emphasizing that the bombs dropped on the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 31st completely tore through the deceptive mask of the US so-called "peace offensive."
    The article pointed out that the resumption of bombing once again shows that US imperialism is trying its best to carry out its policy of "gradually escalating" the war, expanding the war, and aiming not only at the people of Indochina, but mainly at the People's Republic of China.
    The article pointed out that these various acts of aggression by US imperialism are supported and encouraged by the Khrushchev revisionists' stance of reconciliation and surrender in collusion with them against Vietnam and the People's Republic of China.
    At the very moment when the United States is bombing the territory of a socialist country, what the Khrushchev revisionists are mainly concerned about is reaching an agreement with US imperialism—the enemy and executioner of the Vietnamese people—on the issue of "non-proliferation of nuclear weapons."
    The article emphasized that the heroic Vietnamese people have not been intimidated by the threat of American bombs and destruction, nor have they succumbed to the pressure and blackmail of the revisionists who forced them to "unconditionally discuss" and surrender to the aggressors.
    The article said: The Albanian people have always been the fighting brothers of the Vietnamese people and are proud of the heroic and firm stance of the Vietnamese people.

    在裁军会议上暴露假支持真投降的背叛面目
    苏联代表不敢对美国恢复轰炸吭一声
    再次乞求美国不要因越南问题影响苏美核交易
    阿《人民之声报》谴责苏修鼓励美国侵越新冒险
    新华社二日讯　日内瓦消息：美国对越南民主共和国悍然恢复轰炸后，苏联出席日内瓦十七国裁军会议的代表查拉普金的温和反应，使得在场的西方官员和记者都感到意外。据法新社记者一日报道说，“观察家曾经预料这位苏联代表会就美国对越南的政策发表激烈的口头上的攻击，但是他并没有要求发言。”报道说，“同所有人的预期相反，苏联首席代表查拉普金对于美国恢复轰炸北越一事，默无一语。”
    恰恰相反，查拉普金在这一天对记者发表谈话时对美国的强盗行为，无动于衷，而是撇开越南问题不管，一心一意想和美国达成“防止核扩散”等出卖人民利益的协议。他说，“我已经说过，越南和我们的（裁军）谈判这两个问题是不应当牵扯在一起的。”
    法新社在报道这一天的裁军会议时指出，“美国首席代表福斯特本来是准备好回答预料苏联将发出的攻击的，当他看到查拉普金并不打算发言时，他也就保持缄默了。”
    英国代表查尔方特十分得意地说，这一天会议是“在合作和友好的气氛中”举行的，他对这一点“感到极为高兴。”
    合众国际社的消息说，苏联方面“今天在裁军会议上对美国恢复轰炸北越作出了出人意外温和的反应。西方官员说，这种冷静的反映是‘一个良好的征兆’，特别是由于苏联谈判代表查拉普金根本没有发言。”法新社消息说，“西方代表认为苏联这种显然和解的态度是意外地良好的，他们希望这意味着苏联正逐渐使它的立场软下来，从而打开就停止扩散核武器达成协议……的道路。”
    据新华社地拉那一日电  阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》一日发表文章强调指出，一月三十一日投在越南民主共和国领土上的炸弹彻底撕破了美国的所谓“和平攻势”的骗人假面具。
    文章指出，恢复轰炸再一次表明美帝国主义竭力把战争“逐步升级”的政策推行到底，扩大战争，矛头不仅指向印度支那各国人民，而且主要指向中华人民共和国。
    文章指出，美帝国主义的这些种种侵略行动，得到同他们合谋反对越南和中华人民共和国的赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的和解和投降立场的支持和鼓励。
    正当美国轰炸一个社会主义国家的领土的时候，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者主要关心的却是就“不扩散核武器”的问题同美帝国主义——越南人民的敌人和刽子手达成协议。
    文章强调说，但是，英雄的越南人民没有被美国的炸弹和破坏的威胁所吓倒，他们没有向修正主义者迫使他们同侵略者“无条件讨论”和投降的压力和讹诈屈服。
    文章说：阿尔巴尼亚人民始终是越南人民的战斗兄弟，并且为越南人民的英勇坚定的立场感到自豪。
