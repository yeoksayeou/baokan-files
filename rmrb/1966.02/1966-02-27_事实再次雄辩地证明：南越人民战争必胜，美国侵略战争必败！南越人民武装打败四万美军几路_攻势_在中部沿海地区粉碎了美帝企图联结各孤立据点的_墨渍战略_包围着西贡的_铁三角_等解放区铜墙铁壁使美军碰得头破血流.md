　　Facts once again eloquently prove: the South Vietnamese people's war is bound to win, and the American war of aggression is bound to fail!
　　South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces defeat several routes of "offensives" by 40,000 American troops
　　Smashed the US imperialist's "Ink Stain Strategy" attempting to connect isolated strongholds in the central coastal area
　　The iron walls of the "Iron Triangle" and other liberated areas surrounding Saigon made the US military suffer heavy losses.
　　Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: Our correspondent reports: The American aggressor troops have launched a series of so-called "offensives" in South Vietnam since late January. The American propaganda machine has used this to boast that the United States has "changed the tide" on the South Vietnamese battlefield, "gained the initiative," and can be "cautiously optimistic." What is the actual situation? What is the fate of these offensives launched by the American aggressor troops? Let's look at the facts:
　　These "offensives" launched by the American aggressors since late January have many names. Each "offensive" uses a bizarre code name, and there have been eight or nine so far, but in reality, these "offensives" are only concentrated in two areas. One is the An Lao area of ​​Binh Dinh Province in the central coast; the other is around Saigon. The American propaganda machine focused on touting the "offensive" against the An Lao area of ​​Binh Dinh Province in late January and early February. On January 28, more than 10,000 troops from the US First Cavalry Division, plus 20 battalions of South Korean puppet troops and the puppet army, advanced towards the northwest of Phu My in Binh Dinh Province. This was the main attack direction of this "offensive," code-named first "Masher" and later changed to "White Wing." On the same day, more than 5,000 US Marines landed on the coast of Quang Ngai Province and harassed from north to southwest, code-named "Double Eagle." They attempted to use a so-called "pincer" offensive to "capture" the main force of the liberation army.
　　The US, puppet, and South Korean puppet troops advancing from the north of Phu My encountered several hard nails from the start, and a part of them were encircled and annihilated by the Binh Dinh Provincial Liberation Armed Forces. From January 28 to February 4, the Liberation Armed Forces annihilated a total of 1,500 enemies, most of whom were American troops. After annihilating a part of the enemy, the Liberation Armed Forces took the initiative to transfer.
　　The US Marines marching south from Quang Ngai repeatedly came up empty, unable to find the Liberation Army anywhere. On February 7, the US military spokesman in Saigon announced that this force had "met up" with the First Cavalry Division in the An Lao Valley area of ​​Binh Dinh Province. The American propaganda machine immediately boasted that it had completed the "huge encirclement around the Communist-infested mountainous area" in this area. But then they shouted "disappointment" because they still couldn't find the "Viet Cong main force" in this "huge encirclement," and "the enemy is gone." This heavily touted "pincer" offensive actually became an armed parade that was beaten along the way.
　　In helpless "disappointment," these two invading armies began to retreat from the An Lao Valley area on February 17. Because they understood from past experiences of being beaten that if they didn't shrink back immediately, they would be in danger of being eaten. Brigadier General Pratt, the commander of the more than 5,000 US Marines who came from Quang Ngai Province in the north, was fortunate not to have been beaten too badly and self-deprecatingly said, "We have won a major psychological victory over the Viet Cong." But the First Cavalry Division coming from the south did not even get this kind of "psychological victory." Because just as the US Marines were retreating, the Liberation Armed Forces immediately launched fierce attacks on the First Cavalry Division in several directions. On the one hand, they used fierce firepower from the mountain tops on both sides of the road to severely beat the fleeing enemy on the retreat route of the First Cavalry Division, and at the same time launched surprise attacks in the Phu My area. According to a report from United Press International, the Liberation Armed Forces even approached the forward command post of this division located in Phu My on the evening of the 20th. In addition, because this division had almost sent out all its forces, the Liberation Armed Forces took advantage of the emptiness and launched a surprise attack on the division's An Khe base in the western highlands late on the 19th.
　　The American aggressor troops concentrated their forces in Binh Dinh Province this time because Binh Dinh Province is located in a key area connecting the north and south, and it is a strategically important place in military terms. In the past year, the Liberation Armed Forces in Binh Dinh Province have been unprecedentedly active, launching continuous and widespread attacks, annihilating large numbers of US puppet troops, and expanding the liberated areas, which has also seriously threatened the coastal isolated strongholds that the US military attempted to "hold" in this area. The great victory of An Lao by the Liberation Armed Forces at the end of 1964 annihilated 680 enemies in one fell swoop, causing the US puppet troops to lose their courage. In 1965, the army and people of Binh Dinh Province fought continuously and won victory after victory. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 10,000 enemies were annihilated, including more than 2,000 American troops. The Liberation Armed Forces' surprise attacks on the Qui Nhon US military dormitory and Qui Nhon Airport made even the heavily defended strongholds of the US military unsafe. The place names Rong Rieng, Tam Quan, Phu My, Phu Cat, Thuan Ninh, Phu Go and other place names in Binh Dinh Province have become code names for the victories of the Southern army and people. The American aggressors attempted to carry out a "sweep" here and make a desperate struggle, but the result was "defeat again and again," losing another game.
　　The so-called "Cedar Falls", "Iron Triangle", "Junction City", "Quick Kick IV" and other "offensives" launched by the American aggressor troops around Saigon are a continuation of the old plan of the US puppet troops to so-called "pacify" the five provinces around Saigon. In the past year, in the five provinces of Gia Dinh, Thu Dau Mot, Tan An, Bien Hoa, and Cho Lon around Saigon, the Liberation Armed Forces have continued to grow stronger, and the liberated areas have continued to expand, extending to only eight kilometers from Saigon. The "Iron Triangle" on the outskirts of Saigon is like a sharp sword hanging over the enemy's head, making the US puppet group uneasy. The number of guerrilla attacks is becoming more and more frequent. According to a statistic last year, in a place ten kilometers away from Saigon, guerrillas fought an average of one battle every 30 hours in 43 days, killing and wounding an average of three American soldiers and twelve puppet soldiers every day. The great victory of the Liberation Army's main force in Bau Bang and Dau Tieng last November was an even more shocking victory to the world. It was under such a predicament that the American aggressors sent out all their forces this time and carried out a series of "sweeps" around Saigon. On January 8, the US military sent out 8,000 troops to conduct a frantic "sweep" of the "Iron Triangle," code-named "Operation Crimp," followed by the so-called "Cedar Falls", "Iron Triangle", "Junction City", "Quick Kick IV" and other "offensives." These "sweeps" were either empty or were encircled and annihilated by the Liberation Armed Forces, dividing and eating them. The great victory of Cu Chi this year is an example of the victory of the Liberation Armed Forces in countering the "sweep" on the outskirts of Saigon. From January 8 to February 5, the Liberation Armed Forces annihilated more than 2,500 American aggressor troops and Australian accomplice troops in the Cu Chi district of Gia Dinh Province. The larger the scale of the US military's "sweep," the more they were annihilated. This was the case last year, and it is even more so this year.
　　As for the so-called "Van Buren Offensive" launched by the US military in Phu Yen Province, it was just the enemy coming out to grab food. Because in some areas of Phu Yen Province controlled by the US puppets, the food reserves are only enough to eat for one month. The US puppet troops wanted to come out to grab food, but as a result, more than 1,100 people were annihilated by the Liberation Armed Forces. The "Van Buren Offensive" was also declared a failure on February 21. In this way, a series of "offensives" by the American aggressor troops have all failed. Facts show that the American aggressors have not changed any "tide" or gained any "initiative" on the South Vietnamese battlefield. On the contrary, they are still in a passive position and are sinking deeper and deeper in the vast ocean of the South Vietnamese people's war, unable to escape the doom of destruction. In fact, the so-called "offensives" of the American aggressor troops since this year are just counterattacks in local areas after their complete and disastrous defeat last year. The anti-aggression war of the army and people of South Vietnam achieved unprecedented and great victories in 1965, changing the entire battlefield situation. The Liberation Armed Forces launched attacks everywhere, guerrilla warfare blossomed everywhere, and the Liberation Army fought large-scale annihilation battles, wiping out US puppet troops in entire battalions and regiments. The American aggressors concentrated their forces in the above-mentioned areas this year in an attempt to stabilize their position in local areas in the face of overall setbacks and a very chaotic front. They attempted to occupy an area and "consolidate" an area by means of key "sweeps." This is essentially a continuation of the passive "Ink Stain" strategy. The purpose of the "Ink Stain" strategy is to hold Saigon and other major cities and some isolated strongholds along the coast, gradually open up the main transportation lines, and expand outward from the besieged strongholds. This strategy went bankrupt last year and suffered a disastrous defeat again this year.
　　The American aggressor troops dispatched a total of more than 40,000 troops this time, which can be said to have used all their strength. Since the Johnson administration began to accelerate the deployment of troops to South Vietnam in February last year, it has increased its troops to 205,000. Excluding the air force, navy, logistics and other troops, there are a total of more than 120,000 combat troops. Most of the combat troops have to be used to divide and defend various scattered strongholds. Sending out more than 40,000 people is already close to the limit of the troops it can currently deploy on the South Vietnamese battlefield. But the results of the competition show that in the face of the great power of the South Vietnamese people's war, no matter how the American aggressors struggle, it is in vain. Only a little over a month has passed in 1966, and by February 9, the Liberation Armed Forces had annihilated more than 6,500 enemies. It is certain that the heroic and good-fighting Southern army and people will definitely give the enemy heavier blows on the battlefield and achieve more and greater victories in the days to come.

　　事实再次雄辩地证明：南越人民战争必胜，美国侵略战争必败！
　　南越人民武装打败四万美军几路“攻势”
　　在中部沿海地区粉碎了美帝企图联结各孤立据点的“墨渍战略”
　　包围着西贡的“铁三角”等解放区铜墙铁壁使美军碰得头破血流
    新华社二十六日讯　本社记者报道：美国侵略军从一月下旬开始在南越发动一连串的所谓
  “攻势”。美国宣传机器借此大肆吹嘘，说什么美国在南越战场上已经“改变了潮流”，“取得了主动”，可以“谨慎乐观”了。实际情况究竟怎样？美国侵略军发动的这些攻势的下场如何？让我们来看看事实吧：
    美国侵略者从一月下旬开始的这些“攻势”，名目繁多。每个“攻势”用一个稀奇古怪的代号，迄今已有八、九个之多，但实际上，这些“攻势”只是集中在两个地区。其一是在中部沿海平定省的安老地区；其二是在西贡周围。美国宣传机器在一月底二月初着重吹嘘的是对平定省安老地区的“攻势”。一月二十八日，美国第一骑兵师一万余人加上南朝鲜仆从军和伪军共二十个营的兵力，向平定省的蓬山西北方向进犯。这是这次“攻势”的主攻方面，代号先叫“捣碎机”，后改叫“白翼”。同一天，美国海军陆战队五千多人在广义省沿海登陆，自北向西南方向窜扰，代号是“双鹰”。他们企图用所谓“钳形”攻势，“捕捉”解放军的主力。
    从蓬山北部进犯的美、伪军和南朝鲜仆从军一开始就碰上了几个硬钉子，被平定省解放武装力量分股围歼了一部分。从一月二十八日到二月四日，解放武装力量共歼灭敌人一千五百名，其中大部分是美军。解放武装力量在歼敌一部分后就主动转移了。
    从广义南下的美国海军陆战队，连连扑空，到处找不到解放军。二月七日，西贡美军发言人宣布，这支部队同第一骑兵师在平定省的安老谷地区“会师”。美国宣传机器马上吹嘘说，已经完成了对这个地区“共产党出没山区周围的巨大包围”。但是接着它们又大叫“失望”，因为仍然没有在这个“巨大包围圈”中找到“越共主力”，“敌人已经不见了”。这个大吹大擂的“钳形”攻势，实际上成了一次沿途挨打的武装大游行。
    在无可奈何的“失望”中，这两支侵略军从二月十七日开始从安老谷地区撤退。因为他们从过去挨揍的经验中懂得，不马上缩回去，就有被吃掉的危险。从北面广义省来的五千多美国海军陆战队的指挥官普拉特准将自幸挨打不重，还自我解嘲地说：“我们对越共赢得了一次重大的心理上的胜利”。但是从南面来的第一骑兵师却连这种“心理上的胜利”也没有得到。因为正当美国海军陆战队撤退的时候，解放武装力量立即分路猛袭第一骑兵师。他们一方面在第一骑兵师撤退的路上，从两边山头上用猛烈火力痛打逃跑的敌人，同时又在蓬山地区发动突袭。合众国际社的消息透露，解放武装力量在二十日晚间甚至逼近了这个师设在蓬山的前沿指挥所。此外，由于这个师几乎已经倾巢出动，解放武装力量十九日深夜又乘虚猛袭了这个师设在西部高原的安溪基地。
    美国侵略军这次集中兵力在平定省反扑，是因为平定省地居南北要冲，在军事上是兵家必争之地。过去一年里，解放武装力量在平定省空前活跃，连续广泛出击，大批歼灭美伪军，扩大了解放区，使美军在这一带企图“固守”的沿海孤立据点，也受到了严重的威胁。一九六四年底，解放武装力量的安老大捷，一举歼敌六百八十名，使美、伪军为之丧胆。一九六五年一年中，平定省军民连战连捷，据不完全统计，共歼敌一万名，其中包括二千多名美军。解放武装力量对归仁美军宿舍、归仁机场的奇袭，使美军重兵设防的据点也不能保险。平定省的戎岭、三关、蓬山、符吉、顺宁、府固等地名，已经成为南方军民胜利的代号。美国侵略者企图在这里来一次“扫荡”，作一次绝望的挣扎，结果是“再战再败”，又输了一局。
    美国侵略军在西贡周围发动的所谓“鹿皮”、“木槌”、“圆屋”、“快踢四号”等“攻势”，是美伪军所谓“绥靖”西贡周围五省的老计划的继续。在过去一年里，在西贡周围的嘉定、土龙木、新安、堤岸、边和五省，解放武装力量不断壮大，解放区不断扩展，一直伸展到离西贡只有八公里的地方。西贡外围的“铁三角”象一把悬在敌人脑袋上的利剑，弄得美伪集团寝食不安。游击队出击的次数越来越频繁。据去年的一个统计，在离西贡十公里的地方，游击队在四十三天中平均每三十小时就打一仗，平均每天打死打伤美军三名、伪军十二名。解放军主力去年十一月在保邦、油汀的大捷，更是震动世界的大胜利。美国侵略者正是在这种困境下，这次才倾巢出动，在西贡周围搞一系列的“扫荡”。一月八日，美军出动八千人对“铁三角”进行疯狂“扫荡”，代号是“席卷”，其后就有所谓“鹿皮”、“木槌”、“圆屋”、“快踢四号”等“攻势”，这些“扫荡”不是扑空，就是被解放武装力量伺机围歼，分股吃掉。今年的古芝大捷就是解放武装力量在西贡外围反“扫荡”胜利的一个范例。从一月八日到二月五日，解放武装力量在嘉定省古芝县地区共歼灭美国侵略军和澳大利亚帮凶军二千五百多名。美军“扫荡”的规模越大，被歼灭得越多。去年如此，今年更是这样。
    至于美军在富安省发动的所谓“范布伦攻势”，不过是敌人出来抢粮而已。由于在富安省地区，美伪统治的一些地方，粮食储备只够吃一个月。美伪军想出来抢粮，结果却被解放武装力量歼灭了一千一百多人。“范布伦攻势”也在二月二十一日以失败宣告“结束”。这样，美国侵略军的一系列“攻势”就统统失败了。事实表明，美国侵略者在南越战场上并没有改变了什么“潮流”，取得什么“主动权”，相反地，它仍然处于被动挨打的局面，在南越人民战争的汪洋大海中越陷越深，无法逃脱灭顶之灾。其实，美国侵略军今年以来的所谓“攻势”，只不过是它们去年一年全面惨败以后在局部地区的反扑。越南南方军民的反侵略战争在一九六五年取得了空前巨大的胜利，改变了整个战场的形势。解放武装力量到处出击，游击战争遍地开花，解放军大打歼灭战，整营整团地消灭美伪军。美国侵略者今年在上述地区集中兵力反扑，是妄图在全局失利、阵线十分溃乱的形势下，在局部地区稳住阵脚。他们企图用重点“扫荡”的办法，占领一个地区，“巩固”一个地区。这实质上是被动挨打的“墨渍”战略的继续。“墨渍”战略的目的是要守住西贡等几个大城市和沿海的一些孤立据点，逐步打通主要交通线，并且从困守的据点向外扩展。这种战略去年已经破了产，今年又遭到惨败。
    美国侵略军这次共出动四万多兵力，可算是用尽了吃奶的力气。约翰逊政府从去年二月开始加速向南越增兵以来，已经增兵到二十万五千人。除去空军、海军、后勤等部队外，战斗部队共十二万多人。战斗部队中的大部分要用来分兵把守各个分散据点，出动四万多人，已经接近于它目前在南越战场上所能动用兵力的极限。但是较量的结果表明，在南越人民战争的巨大威力面前，美国侵略者不管怎样挣扎，也是枉然。一九六六年才过去一个多月，解放武装力量到二月九日为止，已经歼敌六千五百多名。可以肯定，英勇善战的南方军民，在今后的日子里，必将在战场上给敌人以更沉重的打击，取得更多、更大的胜利。（附图片）
