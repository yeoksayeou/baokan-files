　　Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, February 23rd: Chilean renowned painter Venturieri published an article in the seventeenth issue of "Combate," the organ of the "Spartacus" Revolutionary Organization, praising the Chinese Revolution as a great contribution by the Chinese people to the international cause of the laborers, and pointing out that supporting and defending the Chinese Revolution is the international obligation of all revolutionaries and laborers.
　　The article said, "The Chinese people stand at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle and at the center of the struggle of our time. Our friendship and solidarity (with the Chinese people) come from the struggle."
　　The article pointed out, "When the great revolutionary road was opened, there were also counter-currents, and some people attempted to replace 'geographical fatalism' with 'nuclear fatalism'. However, the people of all countries hope and need revolution. They know the terror of imperialist oppression and understand that the system of aggression and exploitation that has caused countless sacrifices is a fatal radiation."
　　The article said that the experience of the Chinese People's Revolution has promoted the awakening of Latin America. "In Latin America, we already have our free land. In the deep mountains and dense forests, those nameless warriors, taking the Chinese people as an example and raising common guns, express their salute."
　　The article pointed out, "The Chinese Revolution is a great contribution of the Chinese people to the international cause of the laborers. The Chinese Revolution is a great contribution of the Chinese people to the development of the revolutionary thought of our time and to the science of Marxism-Leninism. The immortal honor of leading the Chinese people to revolutionary victory, the great merit of promoting this experience, and the special contribution to the revolutionary theory and practice of the laborers should be attributed to the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong."
　　The article emphasized, "The international obligation of all revolutionaries and laborers in the struggle for class unity is to unite with the Chinese Revolution, and support and defend the Chinese Revolution as an indisputable part of the world revolution."
　　The article said that uniting with China is uniting with the revolution, uniting with the laborers of the world, uniting the forces of the people of all countries against imperialism, and uniting the strong front of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
　　The article also praised China for "developing its country through self-reliance," as "a basic principle of implementing construction and revolutionary struggle."
　　The article said, "It is natural that China has been attacked by imperialists and those who oppose the revolution and the struggle of the people of all countries. However, today's world is a world of anti-imperialist storms. This great storm of justice, combined with the struggle of the Chinese people, is impacting the imperialists and their agents. Those who attack China will be swept away by this great historical call. Revolutionary ideas, revolutionaries, and revolution will become stronger after this struggle. Those who believe in the people, believe in the masses, and are not afraid of the great social storms will be the victors."

　　智利《战斗报》刊载万徒勒里文章指出
　　中国革命经验促进了拉丁美洲的觉醒
　　攻击中国的人将被革命风暴一扫而光
    新华社二十三日讯  圣地亚哥消息：智利著名画家万徒勒里在“斯巴达克”革命组织机关报《战斗报》第十七期发表文章，赞扬中国革命是中国人民对劳动者的国际事业的伟大贡献，并且指出支持和保卫中国革命是一切革命者和劳动者的国际义务。
    文章说，“中国人民站在反帝斗争的前列和我们时代战斗的中心。我们（和中国人民）的友谊和团结来自斗争中。”
    文章指出，“当打开了巨大的革命道路时，还出现了逆流，有人企图以‘核宿命论’代替‘地理宿命论’。但是，各国人民希望和需要革命。他们知道帝国主义压迫的恐怖，了解造成无数生命牺牲的侵略与剥削制度是一种致命的辐射。”
    文章说，中国人民革命的经验促进了拉丁美洲的觉醒。“在拉丁美洲，我们已经有了我们的自由土地，在深山密林中，那些无名的战士们以中国人民为榜样并举起共同的枪表示致敬。”
    文章指出，“中国革命是中国人民对劳动者的国际事业的伟大贡献。中国革命，是中国人民对于我们时代的革命思想的发展、对于马克思列宁主义科学的伟大贡献。领导中国人民取得革命胜利的不朽的荣誉、推广这一经验的巨大功勋以及对劳动者的革命理论和实践的特别贡献，应该归于中国共产党和毛泽东同志。”
    文章强调指出，“所有的革命者、劳动者在争取阶级团结斗争中的国际义务，是联合中国革命，支持和保卫作为世界革命毋庸置疑的一部分的中国革命。”
    文章说，联合中国就是联合革命，就是联合全世界的劳动者，就是联合反对帝国主义的各国人民的力量，联合亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的强大阵线。
    文章还赞扬中国“自力更生地发展它的国家”，以此作为“实行建设和革命斗争的一项基本原则”。
    文章说，“中国遭到了帝国主义者和那些反对革命和反对各国人民斗争的人的攻击，那是自然的。但是，今天的世界是一个反帝风暴的世界。这一伟大的正义风暴与中国人民的斗争结合了起来，冲击着帝国主义者及其代理人。攻击中国的那些人将被这一伟大的历史号召一扫而光。革命思想、革命者和革命，经过这场斗争将更加强大。那些相信人民、相信群众、不害怕伟大的社会风暴的人，将是胜利者。”
