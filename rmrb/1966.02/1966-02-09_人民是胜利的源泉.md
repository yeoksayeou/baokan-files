    The people are the source of victory. The great victories achieved by the patriotic soldiers and civilians in the liberated area of 川圹 (Xieng Khouang), Laos, in the past year or more in the battle against the frantic attacks by the Laotian right-wing army fostered by the United States, once again prove this truth.

    "Rest assured and fight!"

    The battle in which the Lao Patriotic Forces defended Phou Kout Mountain with the full support of the people is a shining example.

    One day, in the command post on the front lines of Phou Kout Mountain, the commander of the Lao Patriotic Forces said to the reporter with great emotion when talking about the victory of the battle, "In the day and night defense war of Phou Kout Mountain, 'the people not only gave us tremendous material support, but also gave us great spiritual encouragement. This is where our strength lies and the inexhaustible source of our victory!'"

    When the reporter was on the front lines of Phou Kout Mountain, he was often deeply moved by the sincere love of the Lao people for their own soldiers. Once, we were driving to the front lines of Phou Kout Mountain late at night. Suddenly, the car was stopped by a group of male and female farmers braving the cold wind waiting on the roadside. After the car stopped, they carried bags and baskets of grain, meat, vegetables and fruits onto the car. They asked us to take these foods to the front lines to comfort the soldiers who were fighting hard.

    Everywhere in the front-line area of Phou Kout Mountain, we saw the local people fighting intensely to support the front lines. Some were repairing bridges and roads, some were transporting grain and ammunition, and some were felling wood and bamboo poles to supply the front-line troops with building fortifications. Once, the front-line troops urgently needed bamboo skewers for traps, but Phou Kout Mountain had been bombed into a bald top by American planes and artillery in more than a year of fierce fighting, and there was not even a single bamboo branch. Farmers in nearby areas immediately launched a bamboo skewer making campaign and sent a large number of bamboo skewers to the troops in a very short time. Another time, a certain unit on the front lines of Phou Kout Mountain took advantage of the battle interval to plant one hundred kilograms of rice seeds near the front lines. But just as the rice was ripening, the enemy launched an attack on Phou Kout Mountain, and the troops were engaged in battle. A few days later, the local people took the initiative to harvest all the rice and sent it to the front lines. They also sent a warm letter of condolence, which said, "Rest assured and fight! We will take care of everything in the rear. Whatever you need, we will definitely support you."

    The army and the people cooperate to attack the enemy

    The major victory of the Patriotic Forces on the southeastern front of 川圹 (Xieng Khouang) in severely打击 (severely striking) the puppet 13th Mobile Regiment with the cooperation of the broad masses of the people is also a vivid example. At that time, the main force of the People's Liberation Army and some local armed forces were fully encircling and annihilating the command organs of the puppet 13th Mobile Regiment. The 13th Battalion of this regiment suddenly divided its forces into two routes and fiercely invaded the area of 芒岸 (Muang Ngone), attempting to occupy this area. Under such urgent circumstances, the local people immediately mobilized and, together with the local armed forces, met the invading enemy.

    Combat oath-taking rallies were held in all villages to ensure that the enemy would be resolutely defeated, their hometowns defended, and the main force of the People's Liberation Army would be supported in completing the task of annihilating the enemy's command organs. All militiamen marched bravely to the front lines to strike the enemy. Others formed war service teams to support the combat troops.

    The local armed forces, in coordination with the broad masses of the militia, immediately divided their forces into two routes to counterattack the invading enemy. The first route of troops met an enemy reinforced company south of 芒岸 (Muang Ngone). Because they were familiar with the terrain, they quickly detoured to the rear of the enemy and basically annihilated the enemy. Another route of troops met another reinforced company of the enemy north of 芒岸 (Muang Ngone). They cleverly seized the favorable terrain first, used fierce firepower to inflict casualties on the enemy, and repelled the enemy's attacks again and again, and finally beat them back in a panic.

    In these ten days, every local person participated in the battle. Some went in and out of the front lines to transport grain and ammunition and transfer the wounded; some stood guard, patrolled, and searched for scattered enemies; some helped the troops to scout the enemy's situation and monitor the enemy. One day, the masses of a certain village discovered that a small unit of the enemy was laying telephone lines. They immediately reported to the troops and guided the troops to quickly surround and annihilate this group of enemies. In this way, the local people heroically crushed the enemy's offensive, defended the liberated areas, and guaranteed the victory of the main force of the People's Liberation Army in annihilating the command organs of the enemy's 13th Mobile Regiment.

    The glorious victories of the soldiers and civilians of 川圹 (Xieng Khouang) Province in the past year or so have once again proved the great power of people's war. No matter how cunning the enemy is, and no matter how the enemy expands the war of aggression, they cannot escape the fate of being annihilated.

### 人民是胜利的源泉

    人民是胜利的源泉
    人民的力量是无敌的。老挝川圹解放区爱国军民一年多来在反击美国豢养的老挝右派军队的疯狂进攻的战斗中取得的重大胜利，再一次证明了这个真理。
    “你们放心战斗吧！”
    老挝爱国部队在人民的全力支持下守卫富科特山的战斗就是一个光辉的例子。
    有一天，在富科特山前线的指挥部里，老挝爱国部队的指挥员谈到战斗的胜利时非常激动地对记者说，在富科特山日日夜夜保卫战中，“人民不仅在物质上给了我们巨大的支援，而且在精神上给了我们极大的鼓舞。这就是我们力量的所在，也是我们胜利的无穷无尽的源泉！”
    记者在富科特山前线的时候，时常被老挝人民对自己子弟兵的真诚热爱所深深感动。有一次，我们在深夜乘汽车到富科特山前线去。突然，车子被一群冒着寒风等在路旁的男女农民挡住了。等车子停下后，他们就把成袋和成筐的粮食、肉类、菜蔬和水果抬到车子上来。他们要求我们把这些食物带到前线去慰问正在进行艰苦战斗的子弟兵。
    我们在富科特山前线地区到处都看到了当地人民为了支援前线而紧张战斗的景象。他们有的人在修桥铺路，有的在运输粮食弹药，有的在砍伐木头和竹杆，供应前线部队建筑工事。有一次，前线部队急需做陷阱用的竹签，但是，富科特山在一年多的激战中已被美国飞机大炮炸成了秃顶，连一棵竹枝也没有。附近地区的农民立刻展开了做竹签的运动，在很短时间里把大量的竹签送到了部队。还有一次，富科特山前线某部曾利用战斗间隙在前线附近种了一百公斤稻种。可是正当稻子成熟的时候，敌人向富科特山发动了进攻，部队便投入了战斗。几天后，当地人民主动把这些稻子全部收割完毕，并且送到了火线。他们还送来了一封热情洋溢的慰问信，信中说：“你们放心战斗吧！后方一切都有我们照管。你们需要什么，我们就一定支援什么。”
    军民配合夹攻敌人
    川圹东南前线爱国部队在广大人民的配合下沉重打击伪十三机动团的重大胜利也是一个生动的例子。当时，解放军主力部队和一部分地方武装正在全力围歼伪十三机动团的指挥机关。这个团的第十三营突然分兵两路猛烈进犯芒岸地区，企图占领这个地区。在这种紧迫的情况下，当地人民立刻动员起来，同地方武装部队一起，迎击来犯的敌人。
    各个村庄都普遍召开了战斗誓师大会，保证坚决打垮敌人，保卫自己家乡，并且支援解放军主力部队完成歼灭敌人指挥机关的任务。所有民兵都雄赳赳地开赴前线，打击敌人。其他的人都组成了战勤队，支援作战部队。
    地方武装部队在广大民兵武装的配合下立刻兵分两路，反击来犯敌人。第一路部队在芒岸以南迎击敌人的一个加强连。他们由于地形熟悉，一开始就迅速绕到敌人的后方，把敌人基本歼灭。另一路部队从芒岸以北迎击另一个加强连的敌人。他们机智地首先抢占了有利地形，用猛烈的火力杀伤敌人，打退了敌人一次又一次的进攻，最后把他们打得狼狈逃窜回去。
    在这十天中，当地人民个个都参加了战斗。有些出入火线运送粮食弹药，转移伤员；有些站岗放哨，搜索溃散的敌人；有些帮助部队侦察敌情，监视敌人。有一天，某村群众发现敌人一支小部队正在架电话线，他们便马上报告部队，并引导部队迅速把这批敌人包围起来全部歼灭。就这样，当地人民英勇地粉碎了敌人的进攻，保卫了解放区，并且保证解放军主力部队完成了歼灭敌人十三机动团指挥机关的胜利。
    川圹省军民这一年多来的光辉胜利，再一次证明了人民战争的强大威力。不管敌人如何狡猾，也不管敌人如何扩大侵略战争，都逃脱不了被歼灭的命运。
