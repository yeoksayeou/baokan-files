　　Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 20th - In Qinghai Province, the activity of learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, as an important component of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, is being carried out among cadres, especially leading cadres, in various places. The broad masses of cadres are taking Jiao Yulu as a mirror, focusing on promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology to resolve their worldview, using the spirit of rectification to find shortcomings, examine thoughts, greatly invigorate revolutionary spirit, establish lofty ambitions, and resolve to build a new socialist Qinghai as quickly as possible.
　　Qinghai is a multi-ethnic region, which in Chinese history was both "poor" and "blank," with relatively backward economic and cultural development. Can the backward situation be changed as quickly as possible? Many leading cadres have drawn spiritual strength from Comrade Jiao Yulu. They unanimously believe that "change" is the regular state of revolution, and doing revolution is doing transformation work, transforming backwardness into advancement. To change backwardness into advancement, the key lies in all party members, cadres, especially leading cadres at the county level and above, establishing the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly and the revolutionary spirit of striving for the best and forging ahead with determination, just like Comrade Jiao Yulu.
　　The broad masses of cadres, comparing themselves with Comrade Jiao Yulu, examined their outlook on life and worldview. Many people examined their fear of hardship and fatigue, their proximity to "self" and distance from "public," which meant they were not standing high enough and not seeing far enough. Many people examined their middle-of-the-road mentality. Wang Yonghan, deputy secretary of the Maduo County Party Committee, said: "Compared with Jiao Yulu, I often fear taking risks in my work, always thinking of holding on to the position, but rarely thinking of capturing the position. When livestock have developed greatly, I think production has reached its peak and I dare not make higher demands." Others examined their conservative, complacent state of mind, lacking the ambitious spirit of Jiao Yulu, who saw afforestation when he saw sand dunes and wanted to reclaim land when he encountered alkaline soil, "showing heroism in the face of difficulties." Zheng Chang'an, secretary of the Party Committee of the Hetaozhuang Commune in Minhe County, said: "Our commune has 331 walnut trees, all planted in the past. For more than ten years, there are still 331 trees. I have been working there for three years, and there are still 331 trees. Why? It's because we have been satisfied with the status quo for a long time."
　　After comparison and examination, everyone's revolutionary spirit was greatly boosted, and their confidence was increased a hundredfold. Yao Ping, deputy secretary of the Haixi Mongolian, Tibetan, and Kazak Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee, said: "As long as we serve the people wholeheartedly, believe that the masses can liberate themselves, and add to that the revolutionization of leadership thinking and proper production command, difficulties can definitely be overcome one by one, and the face of production will undergo great changes."
　　How to change the backward situation? Everyone also found ways from Jiao Yulu, mainly to highlight politics, connect with the masses, and conduct investigation and research. Responsible comrades from counties such as Huzhu and Ledu examined and said: "Highlighting politics is written in documents, spoken in words, posted on walls, but not done in action," "We talk about production with relish, but we are ignorant of politics." Some comrades profoundly criticized the erroneous arguments that "business work is done on the spot, political work is invisible," and "production does not stay overnight, political work can wait until the New Year," and proposed that in the future, they should highlight politics at all times, in all matters, and in all places, and do a good job of human work, just like Jiao Yulu. In terms of connecting with the masses, many people, in comparison with Jiao Yulu, found that their class feelings were weak, their mass viewpoint was not strong, they were floating on the surface, and they could not "sink down" when staying at grassroots levels. In the future, we must change our leadership style, put down our airs, look downward, have our hearts towards the people, and stick to the people. In terms of investigation and research, everyone examined the work style of being crude rather than detailed, superficial rather than deep, satisfied with listening to reports, and divorced from reality, and proposed to adhere to investigation and research, just like Jiao Yulu, not eating food chewed by others.
　　Everyone believes that the most fundamental thing in learning from Jiao Yulu is to learn how to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works and to take Mao Zedong Thought as the highest standard

　　青海广大干部以焦裕禄同志为镜子
　　决心兴无灭资改造世界观
　　树立雄心壮志建设新青海
    新华社西宁二十日电　在青海省，学习焦裕禄同志的活动，作为活学活用毛主席著作的一个重要组成部分，正在各地干部特别是领导干部当中展开。广大干部以焦裕禄为镜子，以兴无灭资、解决世界观为重点，运用整风精神，找差距，查思想，大振革命精神，树立雄心壮志，决心尽快建设好社会主义的新青海。
    青海是个多民族地区，在我国历史上是既“穷”又“白”，经济文化都比较落后。落后面貌能不能尽快地改变？许多领导干部从焦裕禄同志身上汲取了精神力量。一致认为，“变”是革命的常规，干革命就是做的转化工作，把落后转化为先进。要变落后为先进，关键在于全体党员、干部，特别是县以上领导干部，要象焦裕禄同志那样，树立完全彻底地为人民服务的思想和力争上游、奋发图强的革命精神。
    广大干部对照着焦裕禄同志，检查了自己的人生观世界观。不少人检查自己怕苦、怕累，离“我”近，离“公”远，这就站得不高，看得不远。不少人检查了自己的中游思想。玛多县委副书记汪永涵说：“和焦裕禄相比，我在工作中往往是怕担风险，总是想守住阵地，却很少去夺取阵地，牲畜有了很大发展，就以为生产到顶了，不敢提出更高要求。”还有的人检查了故步自封、骄傲自满的精神状态，没有象焦裕禄那样目光四射，看到沙丘想造林，遇上碱地想造田，“在困难面前逞英雄”的雄心壮志。民和县核桃庄公社党委书记郑长安说：“我们公社有三百三十一株核桃树，都是以前种的，十多年来，还是三百三十一株，我去工作三年了，仍是三百三十一株。为什么？就是因为我们长期满足现状”。
    经过对照检查，大家革命精神大振，信心百倍提高。海西蒙古族藏族哈萨克族自治州州委副书记要平说：只要我们全心全意为人民服务，相信群众自己能够解放自己，再加上领导思想革命化，生产指挥得当，困难就一定能一个一个地克服，生产面貌就会起很大变化。”
    落后面貌怎样改变？大家也从焦裕禄身上找到了办法，主要的就是突出政治，联系群众，调查研究。互助、乐都等县的负责同志检查说：“突出政治，文件上写着，口头上说着，墙上贴着，就是行动上没有做着”、“谈生产津津有味，讲政治懵懵懂懂。”有的同志深刻地批判了“业务工作现打现，政治工作看不见”，“生产不过夜，政治能过年”等不重视政治工作的错误论调，提出今后要象焦裕禄那样时时、事事、处处突出政治，做好人的工作。在联系群众方面，很多人对照焦裕禄，找出了自己的阶级感情淡薄，群众观点不强，浮在上面，蹲点“沉不下去”。今后必须改变领导作风，做到架子放下，眼睛向下，心向人民，心贴人民。在调查研究方面，大家检查了粗而不细，浮而不深，满足于听汇报，脱离实际的工作作风，提出要坚持调查研究，象焦裕禄那样不吃别人嚼过的馍。
    大家认为，学习焦裕禄，最根本的是学习他活学活用毛主席的著作，时时事事以毛泽东思想为最高准则。在学习焦裕禄事迹的过程中，很多同志重温了《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》等文章和毛主席有关领导方法问题的著作以及哲学著作。有的同志修订了学习毛主席著作的计划。
