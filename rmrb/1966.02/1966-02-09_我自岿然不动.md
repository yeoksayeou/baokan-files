	A purely business viewpoint is a habitual force in financial and trade departments. Since it is a habit, it easily emerges consciously or unconsciously. Since it is a force, it often forms an impact.
	In the Dahe'an District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the purely business viewpoint made three impacts on giving prominence to politics last year. These impacts did not come from ordinary people, but from the heads of distribution stores, and even from the director of the district cooperative. The "hats" were also quite large: "Political work affected the completion of the plan." "Grasping politics has made the work chaotic." In the face of this "offensive," what attitude should one take? One should be firm, one should struggle, one should unswervingly adhere to principles. Comrade Ni Yingjie and others did this, and they did it correctly. In the struggle against purely business viewpoints, one needs the revolutionary spirit of "the enemy forces surround us thousands deep, but I stand firm and immovable."
	The relationship between politics and business can only be: politics first, business second; politics must command business. The positions cannot be reversed, and they cannot be treated as equal. If the plan is completed well, we must give prominence to politics; if the plan is not completed well, we must give even greater prominence to politics. When business is slow, we must give prominence to politics; when business is busy, we must not fail to give prominence to politics. Because, once socialist financial and trade enterprises are divorced from proletarian politics, they are in danger of "going astray." Here, the issue is not primarily whether the plan is completed well or badly, or whether business is busy or slow, but whether or not we adhere to the direction of socialist enterprises.
	The struggle between giving prominence to politics and purely business viewpoints is essentially a class struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate capitalism. This struggle will be repeated. Revolutionaries must firmly grasp the key link of class struggle, that is, they must always firmly hold the helm, and never change course because of every little disturbance.

### 我自岿然不动

    我自岿然不动
    单纯业务观点，在财贸部门是一种习惯势力。既然是习惯，它就容易自觉或不自觉地冒出来。既然是一种势力，它往往能形成一股冲击力量。
    在大河岸区供销社，去年一年，单纯业务观点就对突出政治作了三次冲击。这些冲击不是来自一般的人，而是来自分销店负责人，甚至就来自这个区社的主任。“帽子”也挺大：“政治工作影响了完成计划。”“抓政治，使工作搞得乱七八糟。”在这种“攻势”面前，应当抱什么态度？应当坚定，应当斗争，应当毫不动摇地坚持原则。倪英杰等同志这样做了，做得对。在反对单纯业务观点的斗争中，需要有“敌军围困万千重，我自岿然不动”的革命气魄。
    政治和业务的关系，只能是政治第一，业务第二，只能是政治统帅业务。不能颠倒位置，不能等量齐观。计划完成得好，要突出政治，计划完成得不好，更要突出政治。业务闲的时候要突出政治，业务忙的时候更不能不突出政治。因为，社会主义的财贸企业一旦脱离了无产阶级政治，就有“误入歧途”的危险。这里首先不是计划完成得好坏和业务忙闲的问题，而是是不是坚持社会主义企业的方向问题。
    突出政治和单纯业务观点的斗争，实质上是一场兴无灭资的阶级斗争，这一斗争是会反复进行的。革命者就要紧紧抓住阶级斗争这条纲，也就是要永远掌稳这个舵，决不能因为风吹草动，就随风转舵。
