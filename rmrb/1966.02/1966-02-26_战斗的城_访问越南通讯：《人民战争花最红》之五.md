    The driver comrade, speeding up, excitedly told us: We're not far from Vinh City.

    Vinh City is the famous birthplace of the Nghe-Tinh Soviet movement. Today, in a new test, it is creating new glory. Before we arrived, Nghe An province, which includes this city, had already shot down eighty-nine enemy planes. Coupled with the deep impression the old Party members from the Nghe-Tinh era gave us along the way, we respected and yearned for this heroic city even more.

    The car sped along Highway 1. Just thirty minutes after crossing the Gianh River ferry, we saw flickering lights in the distance. Public Security Officer Dinh Van Loi couldn't help but shout with joy:

      "Lights! Can you see the lights?"

    I looked forward through the windshield, the lights becoming denser and denser, until a brilliantly lit city appeared before us. In a peaceful life, seeing such a sight would be very ordinary; but under such frequent enemy bombing, to see such bright lights, how exciting and exhilarating it is! This is no ordinary light, but the will of the Vietnamese people to resist the enemy shining brightly!

    The car drove into Vinh City. I repeatedly reminded the driver to drive slower so that I could take a good look at the heroic city's appearance.

    The city was calm and peaceful. Trenches were visible everywhere, and along both sides of the street, at short intervals, were circular single-person shelters. Militiamen with guns walked back and forth, cooperating with the people's police to maintain order. There were quite a few pedestrians on the street. Bicycles sped back and forth. Groups of three or five female militia members walked, chatting and laughing, and we even heard their singing from time to time. Those who had been evacuated during the day were riding their bicycles like a whirlwind, rushing back from the suburbs, their long-haired wives sitting behind them. Especially charming were the stalls selling fresh tea leaves and local tobacco, lit with small oil lamps on both sides of the street, attracting customers. These small oil lamps, placed every thirty to fifty steps, adorned the unique scenery of the Vietnamese night market. The small restaurants seemed even more bustling, some putting tables right on the roadside. Everyone gathered around a small oil lamp, like a family, eating and talking, preparing for the night's work and the next day's battle. ...

    We got out of the car in the square in front of the church, waiting for Comrade Loi to make contact. The driver took two sleeping mats out of the car, and we sat on the ground, chatting. Tonight, everyone was very excited to see Vinh City's bustling wartime life. Especially Comrade Ha Mao Nhai, he kept staring at the streetlights on the telephone poles, showing a deeply moved expression. He told us that twenty days ago, when he left here, the Vinh City power plant had just been bombed. Today, suddenly seeing such bright lights, and thinking of the fighting spirit of the workers, he felt an indescribable joy. ...

    I was attracted by Comrade Nhai's talk and couldn't help but look up at the electric lights, one by one. I thought to myself, how great it would be to see those workers in person!

    While we were talking, suddenly the loudspeaker on the telephone pole issued a short, powerful shout:

    "Attention, citizens of this city! Attention, citizens of this city! Enemy planes have been detected, flying along the coast! Prepare for battle immediately! Prepare for battle immediately! ..."

    Almost at the same time, all the lights in the city went out as if someone had given a command.

    We excitedly looked up, waiting for the coming air battle. Not long after, the rumbling sound of planes came from far and near. Several searchlight beams, like silver swords suddenly extending from the ground, swept across the sky. Then came strings of anti-aircraft fire, like fiery dragons soaring into the air.

    In just a few minutes, the enemy planes fled. The lights of Vinh City shone brightly again, as if even brighter than before.

    What beautiful and attractive lights!

    A few days later, one morning, in a small village in the suburbs, we met with a Party Committee member and several worker comrades from the Vinh City power plant.

    This small village, nestled by a stream, sits in the middle of green rice paddies. Outside the farmhouses, looking up, you can see clusters of elegant bamboo, all growing as thick as teacups. It seemed very peaceful. The cuckoos here seemed to be more numerous than in Thanh Hoa. They sang all night yesterday, and this morning, they were still singing, sometimes far and sometimes near.

    The Party Committee member introduced us to the situation of the Vinh City power plant. From his tone full of pride, we learned that this plant was a fighting fortress in the revolution of 1930. Since the enemy's air raids on the North, it has withstood three major bombings and has become a strong fighting unit.

    Why could it do this? The Party Committee member emphasized:

    "This is because our plant has a good Party foundation, with Party members and Youth League members accounting for more than half; and we attach great importance to ideological work. We make every comrade understand the importance of their position. If the machine stops running for a few minutes, it will immediately affect all aspects. Therefore, we put forward the slogan: 'We must produce and fight like soldiers on the gun emplacement'..."

    Speaking of this, machine worker and twenty-three-year-old Youth League Secretary Pham Xuan Dieu said:

    "Let me talk about Comrade Le Thi My Hue. If you listen to her deeds, you will know what spirit our plant uses to fight."

    I hurriedly asked, "Why didn't she come today?"

    "She has already sacrificed herself," Pham Xuan Dieu said.

    "She was a female technician in our factory and also a member of our Youth League branch committee. She usually performed very well, always thinking about reducing costs. She was lively and generous and could mingle with the masses. So, when she sacrificed herself, all the comrades in the factory were very saddened. ..." Pham Xuan Dieu paused, recalling, "That day was June 4th. Enemy planes came once in the morning, and we had just run to the position when they flew away. We were eating breakfast when they suddenly swooped down from behind Quyet Mountain, from an unexpected direction, first spewing out a cloud of black smoke to cover themselves, and then dropping bombs on the factory. Then four enemy planes took turns bombing and strafing. Coal dust flew, and dust filled the air, and for a while, we couldn't see anything. Even so, we did not stop fighting. We followed the howling sound of the enemy planes swooping down and fired fiercely at them. After the enemy planes flew away, we heard that someone was injured, and I quickly ran back to the factory building, climbed up the stairs full of broken bricks and tiles to the third floor, and saw someone standing there. It turned out to be Le Thi My Hue. I called her several times, but she didn't respond, and then I realized she had sacrificed herself. But she was still holding the alarm gong in one hand and grabbing the stairs with the other, her long hair loose, standing there like a bronze statue. ..." Pham Xuan Dieu paused again and continued, "Her task was originally to ring the alarm gong, and she had every opportunity to leave; but not only did she not leave, but at the moment of the most intense bombing, she ran to the fourth floor, checked the pressure gauge, turned off the gauge, and then left. Unfortunately, she sacrificed herself on the stairs. ..."

    Everyone was deeply moved by Le Thi My Hue's deeds. In my mind, a great image was immediately erected! This is an image that is even more sublime and holy than the legendary Statue of Liberty holding a torch!

    The Party Committee member nodded and continued:

      "Yes, our worker comrades are fighting in this spirit." He pointed to a tall old worker sitting next to me and said, "Take our electrician, Comrade Dau Khac Xin, for example. He is the same. His work is different from others: others avoid bombs, but he has to meet them. Wherever the bombing is most intense, he rushes to that place. Last year, on August 5th, when the enemy bombed Vinh City for the first time, he saw that the transmission line across the Lam River was broken, and the power pole was very high. Normally, the line would have to be unloaded first, which would take at least two or three hours to reconnect. He felt that this would take too much time, so he borrowed a fire-fighting ladder and climbed halfway into the sky. Above him were diving enemy planes, and below him was an anti-aircraft gun position, with shrapnel falling everywhere. He repaired it in just eight minutes. Now that enemy planes are constantly bombing, these things are commonplace for him. ..."

    Dau Khac Xin smiled modestly. His hair was already gray, he was wearing a faded coarse twill work uniform, and he carried a tool bag behind his leather belt. Whether from his upright and neat demeanor or from his short, powerful fingers, you could tell that this was a true worker. I stared at him, thinking to myself: It is not easy for such an elderly man with gray hair to climb into the sky amidst thick smoke and fire, and lie on the power line!

      "This is my own job." Dau Khac Xin said these things very casually. "I worked as a small electrician in this factory for eight years. Once, because I didn't give gifts to the French, I was kicked out. I wandered everywhere, and learned to drive a car, and worked as a driver for twenty-three years. After the August Revolution, I returned to the factory. I know who I used to work for and who I am working for now. In 1963, an accident occurred in the factory, and I handled it. The factory rated me as a model, but I didn't accept it; even the things that the Party Committee member just talked about, I feel are just my own responsibilities. A worker should do this, let alone a Party member. ..."

    "How old are you this year?" I asked.

      "Fifty-nine years old," Dau Khac Xin said, "Originally, I was supposed to retire next year, but since the enemy bombed the North, I thought, I can't retire! If I do, I won't be able to eat or sleep. Now the enemy is bombing the North every day, and the South has not yet been liberated, so it's not time to retire!" He said, as if arguing with someone, "Retirement cannot only look at age, but also at the environment and conditions. As long as I have a breath left, and have not yet shed my last drop of blood, I have to keep working!"

    The Party Committee member had just lit a cigarette, preparing to say something, when we heard a burst of intense anti-aircraft fire outside, and people were clamoring:

    "Shot down! Shot down!"

    "One plane! One plane!"

    "No, no, two planes! Look over there!"

    People left their seats and ran into the yard. How happy it is to see the enemy plane shot down with your own eyes! It's a pity that I didn't see it clearly several times in Thanh Hoa. This time I have to seize the opportunity. I thought I had just stepped out of the door when Public Security Officer Loi shouted: "Comrade Wei! Camouflage! Camouflage!" I just grabbed the green camouflage cloth when he shouted again: "Hat! Hat! There are shrapnel outside." When I picked up my cork helmet and ran out, I looked at the sky, and the enemy plane had already flown away, leaving only two long black streaks of smoke in the blue sky. What great artist had just swept two bold strokes, dipped in dark ink! Looking at the smoke beside the streaks, the white round smoke of anti-aircraft guns, like the fluff of autumn dandelions, was blown into the sky and hung there.

    I complained to Comrade Loi endlessly, but he was silent, just smiling smugly. The cuckoo, as if reporting good news, was singing in the green fields, one voice after another.

    Everyone returned to the room, lit "Dien Bien Phu" brand cigarettes, and continued the conversation we had been having.

    Sitting diagonally opposite me was a worker, with a round face, big eyes, and handsome features, lively and intelligent. He said he was thirty-four years old, but he looked much younger. The Party Committee member pointed to him and said:

    "This is our turbine team leader, Comrade Huang Yu Zu. Let him talk, he is also holding fast to his post like Le Thi My Hue."

    The Party Committee member briefly told us: In the fierce bombing, Huang Yu Zu let the three comrades in his team retreat to a safe place, and he himself did the work of four people. His workplace was on the second floor. A bomb exploded a dozen meters away from him. There was smoke and fire, and shards of glass flying everywhere. At this time, he felt his way to the third floor and turned off the generator. He couldn't see the other comrades, so he felt his way to the telephone and encouraged others on the telephone. He shouted: "Comrades! Our guns and cannons are machines, our positions are machine tools, we must persist with the spirit of Nguyen Van Troi! ..."

      "I am a Southerner," Huang Yu Zu said, "My home is in Da Nang. Even now, the enemy is still ravaging my hometown." He tried to restrain his feelings. "In 1954, I gathered in the North, thinking that I could reunite with my family in just two years. Now it has been eleven years, not to mention going home, I haven't even received any news for many years." He could no longer suppress his excitement.

  "Until 1958, I got some news: the enemy arrested my father, broke his left arm, and forced him to sever his father-son relationship with me. They are still dissecting stomachs and digging out livers there, and some of them are my relatives. ... Comrade, think about it, the motherland is divided into two halves, and the family is divided into two halves, what does this taste like? Can I sleep peacefully? I have repeatedly proposed to return to the South to participate in the battle. Comrades comforted me, persuaded me, and told me to turn my hatred for the enemy into strength and do a good job in socialist construction in the North. This is also right. I can't wait to use all my strength. I often think: What exactly can I do to be worthy of the compatriots who are fighting bloody battles in the South? To be worthy of being a Southerner? As long as I think like this, I am not afraid of anything, and it is okay to risk my life. ..."

    Speaking of this, Comrade Huang Yu Zu took out photos of his parents and wife for us to see. And told us that these photos were secretly brought from his hometown in 1958. Since then, there has been no news again, and after everyone looked at them, their feelings became even heavier.

    Comrade Huang Yu Zu put away the photos, remained silent for a long time, and then continued:

    "We must defend the North and liberate the South. Our will to unify the motherland cannot be stopped by any force. On June 4th, the enemy bombed our power plant. Strangely, some foreign reporters described our Vinh City as desolate. At that time, our workers were very angry when they heard about this, and they turned on the lights on the 7th. Let everyone come and see what kind of city our Vinh City is!"

    Speaking of this, everyone added that when those reporters came here, the power plant had not actually been bombed, but only that the streetlights were fewer than usual due to air defense.

    "There are also strange things," another comrade said angrily, "In a place in front, they even asked our soldiers to sit down, put their rifles casually on their shoulders, and put on a sad face to take a photo. At that time, the soldiers were very indignant and said to the reporter: 'Our Vietnamese soldiers do not have this posture! If you want to see our posture, go to the anti-aircraft gun position and watch it when the enemy planes come!'..."

    In fact, I have heard a lot of these ugly things. Some Soviet reporters who came to Vietnam for "visits" only boasted about their aid to Vietnam and discouraged the Vietnamese people. They spread war terror everywhere. They said that on the road from Vinh City to north of Hanoi, "car drivers, ferry sailors, passengers, pedestrians, etc. died under American bombs and bullets," "the sky was filled with the dazzling light of 'air-to-ground' rockets," and that "the road shook for half an hour in the bombing," and so on. Moreover, they adopted extremely cunning methods when spreading war terror. For example, Zhukov, who made a fool of himself in Tokyo, his communication about Thanh Hoa, on the surface, seemed to be criticizing McNamara for bombing non-military targets, but in fact, he was using this topic to vigorously publicize the "misery" of the war. Saying that this Vietnamese person "shrapnel pierced his lungs," that Vietnamese person "his collarbone was broken by a rocket," and then "his legs were blown off by a bomb." What exactly are these gentlemen trying to do? Aren't they clearly cooperating with the howling sound of American bandit planes to scare the Vietnamese people! Shamefully, not only do they use their pens to slander the heroic Vietnamese people, but they also want to create a picture of a dejected Vietnamese soldier to illustrate that the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against aggression is meaningless and has no future. No wonder it caused great indignation among the Vietnamese comrades. In fact, why did Zhukov need such a photo so much trouble? Wouldn't it be very appropriate and readily available for them to take a photo of themselves and publish it!

    In the evening, we ended this warm conversation. Before leaving, the comrades from the power plant shook our hands tightly again and said:

    "We guarantee to our Chinese comrades: We will always keep Vinh City brightly lit, and let the lights illuminate every street and alley!"

    The worker comrades rode their bicycles home in the moonlight. I watched them off by the side of the village. In the distance, Vinh City had already lit up with dense lights, and there was a faint noise of joy. At this moment, I felt that these lights were even brighter and more lovely. Among those lights, I seemed to see the sublime and holy image of Le Thi My Hue, holding a copper gong in one hand and raising a torch in the other, her long hair loose, standing high in the sky above Vinh City, the points of light, just like the sparks flying from her torch...

    I silently praised in my heart: Oh, Vinh City, you have such heroic children, how can I not call you a fighting city, a heroic city!

　　战斗的城
　　——访问越南通讯：《人民战争花最红》之五
　　魏巍
    司机同志一面加快速度，一面兴奋地告诉我们：前面不远，就是荣市了。
    荣市，是闻名的义静苏维埃运动的故乡。今天，在新的考验中，它又创立着新的光荣。在我们来到以前，包括这座城市在内的义安省，已经击落了八十九架敌机。加上沿路义静时代老党员给予我们的深刻印象，使我们愈加敬重、愈加向往这座英雄的城市了。
    汽车开足马力在一号公路上飞驰。过了禁河渡口只不过三十分钟，就看见远处出现了闪闪烁烁的灯光。公安员丁文利同志，不禁充满喜悦地喊道：
      “电灯！你们看见电灯了吗？”
    我顺着挡风玻璃向前望去，灯光点点，愈来愈密，终于一座灯火辉煌的城市，出现在面前。在和平生活里，看到这种景象，那是很平常的；而在敌机如此频繁的轰炸之下，能看到这样灿烂的灯火，叫人多么激动和兴奋呵！这哪里是平凡的灯火，这是越南人民的抗敌意志闪放着光华！
    车子开进荣市。我几次提醒司机开得慢些，以便好好看看这座英雄城的姿容。
    城市是镇定而安详的。交通壕随处可见，街道两边，每隔不远，还有一个圆形的单人掩体。背着枪的民兵们，走来走去，配合着人民警察维持秩序。街上行人不少。自行车来往奔驰。三五成群的女民兵，一路走，一路说说笑笑，还不时听到她们的歌声。那些白天疏散的人们，正刮风一样骑着自行车纷纷从城郊归来，后面坐着他们披着长发的妻子。尤其别具风味的，是那些卖鲜茶叶和土烟的小摊，在街道两边点着小油灯，招引顾客。这些小油灯，每隔三五十步就有一盏，点缀着越南夜市特有的景色。小饭馆更是显得喧闹，有的把桌子一直摆到路边。大家围着一盏小油灯，象家人一般地团聚着，吃着说着，准备着夜间的工作和第二天的战斗。……
    我们在教堂前面的广场上下车，等待利同志取联系去了。司机同志从车上抱下两张凉席，大家席地而坐，闲谈起来。今晚大家看到荣市沸腾的战时生活，都显得兴奋非常。尤其何茂涯同志，他老是望着电线杆上的路灯出神，显出深深感动的神情。他告诉我们，二十天前，他离开这里时，荣市发电厂刚刚被炸，今天忽然看到这么灿烂的灯火，想起工人同志的战斗精神，真是说不出的喜悦。……
    我被涯同志的谈话所吸引，不由得也仰起头来，望着一盏一盏的电灯。心里想，能够亲眼看看那些工人同志该多好呵！
    正谈话间，忽然电线杆上的喇叭发出短促有力的喊声：
    “本市市民注意！本市市民注意！现在发现敌机，正沿着海岸飞来！立即准备战斗！立即准备战斗！……”
    差不多与这同时，全市的电灯，象谁喊了一声口令似地一齐熄灭了。
    我们兴奋地仰起头来，等待着将要来临的空战。时间不大，由远而近传来了隆隆的飞机声。几支探照灯柱，象陡然从地面上伸出的银色的长剑，横扫天空。随后是一串串象火龙腾空一般的高射炮火。
    只不过几分钟工夫，敌机就逃遁了。荣市的灯火又大放光明，仿佛比刚才还要明亮。
    多么美丽引人的灯火呵！
    几天后的一个早晨，我们在城郊的一个小村庄里，同荣市发电厂的一位党委委员和几位工人同志会面了。
    这个小村庄，傍着一条溪水，座落在青青的稻田中。农舍外面，一抬头，就可以看见一簇簇清雅的竹子，都长得象茶杯那么粗细。显得很是清幽。这里的布谷鸟，似乎比清化还多。昨天啼唱了一个夜晚，今天早晨，还在远一声近一声地啼唱着。
    党委委员向我们介绍了荣市发电厂的情况。从他充满自豪感的语调里，我们了解到，这个厂，在一九三○年的革命中，就是一个战斗堡垒。敌人空袭北方以来，已经对它进行了三次大轰炸，它都经受住了考验，并且成为一个坚强的战斗单位。
    为什么能够做到这一点呢？党委委员着重地说：
    “这是因为我们厂党的基础好，党员和团员占一半以上；而且我们十分重视思想工作。我们让每个同志都懂得自己岗位的重要，只要机器停止运行几分钟，就立刻会影响到各个方面。因此，我们提出口号：要象炮盘上的战士那样去进行生产，进行战斗……”
    说到这里，机器工人、二十三岁的团支部书记范春耀说：
    “让我谈谈黎氏美槐同志吧。你们听听她的事迹，就会知道我们厂是用什么精神来进行战斗的。”
    我忙问：“她今天怎么没来？”
    “她已经牺牲了。”范春耀说。
    “她是我们厂的女技术员，又是我们团支部的委员。她平时就表现得很好，时时刻刻都想到把成本降低。人又活泼大方，能同群众打成一片。所以，她牺牲的时候，全厂的同志都很悲痛。……”范春耀停了一停，回忆着说，“那天是六月四号。早晨敌机来了一次，我们刚跑上阵地，它就飞走了。我们正吃早饭，它又从我们预料以外的方向、从决山后面突然扑过来，先喷出一股黑烟掩护自己，接着就向厂里投弹。随后四架敌机轮番轰炸扫射。煤屑飞扬，尘土弥漫，一时什么也看不清。即使这样，我们也没有停止战斗。我们循着敌机扑下来的啸声向它猛烈射击。敌机飞走以后，听说有人负伤，我连忙跑回厂房，沿着满是碎砖烂瓦的楼梯爬上三楼，看见一个人站在楼梯那里。原来这就是黎氏美槐。我连叫了几声，没有回应，才知道她牺牲了。但她却仍然一只手提着警报锣，一只手抓着楼梯，披着长发，象一尊铜象站在那里。……”范春耀沉了一沉，又继续说，“她的任务本来是敲警报锣，是完全有机会走开的；可是她不但没有走开，反而在轰炸最紧的时刻，跑上了四楼，检查了压力电表，把电表关好，然后才离开。不幸牺牲在楼梯那里。……”
    大家都为黎氏美槐的事迹深深感动。在我的脑海里，立时树起一个多么伟大的形象！这是比传说中的、手执火炬的自由女神，还要崇高还要圣洁的形象呵！
    党委委员点点头，接着说：
      “是的，我们的工人同志就是用这种精神来进行战斗的。”他指指坐在我身边的一个高个儿的老工人说，“就拿我们的电工窦克欣同志来说，也是这样。他这工作与别人不同：别人是躲着炸弹走，他是要迎着炸弹走，哪里轰炸最激烈，就赶到哪里去。去年‘八·五’，敌人第一次轰炸荣市，他看到横过蓝江的输电线断了，电杆很高。要按平时，需要先把线卸下来，至少要用两三个小时，才能把线接好。他觉得这样太费时间，就借了一个救火的梯子，爬到半天空里。头上是俯冲的敌机，下面是高射炮阵地，弹片刷刷地落着。他只用了八分钟的时间就修复了。现在敌机不断轰炸，这些事对于他已经是家常便饭了。……”
    窦克欣谦逊地笑了一笑。他的头发已经花白，穿着一件褪了色的粗斜纹布的工作服，皮腰带后面带着工具兜儿。无论从他挺拔俐落的神态，或是从他粗短有力的手指，都可以看出这是一个地道的工人。我凝望着他，心中想道：这样一位头发花白的老人，能够在浓烟烈火中奋力爬上高空，趴在电线上，真不是件容易事呵！
      “这是我本身的工作。”窦克欣把这些看得十分平常地说。“我在这厂里当过八年小电工。有一次，因为没有给法国人送礼，把我赶出去。我到处流浪，又学驾驶汽车，当了二十三年司机。八月革命后，我才回厂。我知道，过去是给谁干活，现在是给谁干活。一九六三年，厂里发生了一件事故，我作了处理，厂里评我是模范，我没有接受；就是刚才党委委员谈的这些事，我也觉得都不过是自己应尽的责任。一个工人就应当这样做，更别说是党员了。……”
    “你今年多大年纪了？”我问。
      “五十九岁了。”窦克欣说，“本来明年该退休了，从敌人轰炸北方以来，我想，我不能退休！这样我会吃不下饭，睡不着觉。现在敌人天天都在轰炸北方，南方也还没有解放，退休不是时候！”他象同谁争辩似的，又说，“退休，不能只看年龄，要看环境，要靠条件。只要我还有一口气，还没有献出最后一滴血，我就得干下去！”
    党委委员刚点起一支烟，准备说什么，这时候，听见外面响起一阵激烈的高射炮声，人们一片喧嚷：
    “打下了！打下了！”
    “一架！一架！”
    “不不，两架！你朝那边看！”
    人们纷纷离座，向院里跑去。亲眼看看打落敌机，是多么痛快的事呵！可惜在清化有几次好机会，我都没有看清。这回可要抓紧。谁想我刚刚踏出屋门，公安员利同志就叫：“同志巍！伪装！伪装！”我刚抓起绿色的伪装布，他又叫：“帽子！帽子！外面有弹片。”等到我又拿起软木军帽跑出去时，看看天空，敌机已经飞走，在碧蓝的天空里，只留下两缕长长的黑黑的烟痕。这是哪位大艺术家，蘸饱浓墨，刚刚扫过粗犷的两笔呵！看看烟痕旁边，点缀着白白的圆圆的高射炮的烟朵，象是秋天蒲公英的绒毛一般被吹上天空悬在那里。
    我对利同志真是埋怨不止，而他却不作声，只是得意地微笑。布谷鸟象是传报捷音一般，在绿色的田野里，一声声地啼唱着。
    大家回到屋子里，燃起“奠边府”牌的香烟，继续着刚才的谈话。
    在我斜对面，坐着一位工人，圆胖脸，大眼睛，眉目清俊，活泼聪明。他自己说三十四岁了，看去却年轻得多。党委委员指指他说：
    “这是我们的透平组长黄玉足同志。让他谈谈吧，他也象黎氏美槐那样坚守着自己的岗位。”
    党委委员简略地告诉我们：在激烈的轰炸中，黄玉足让组里的三个同志撤退到安全的地方，自己一个人做四个人的工作。他工作的地点是二楼，一颗炸弹在离他十几米处爆炸了，又是烟，又是火，玻璃片子乱飞，周围什么也看不见。他就在这时摸上了三楼，把发电机关上。他看不见别的同志，就摸到电话机旁，从电话上鼓动别人。他喊：“同志们！我们的枪炮就是机器，我们的阵地就是机床，我们要用阮文追的精神来坚持呵！……”
      “我是南方人。”黄玉足说，“我的家就在岘港。直到现在，敌人还在糟踏我的家乡。”他竭力克制着自己的感情。“一九五四年，我集结到北方，满以为只过两年就可以同家人团聚，现在已经十一年了，不要说回家，好多年连个音讯都得不到。”他已经压制不住自己的激动。
  “直到一九五八年，我才得到一点消息：敌人逮捕了我的父亲，打断了他的左臂，硬逼着同我脱离父子关系。他们还在那里剖腹挖肝，其中就有我的亲人。……同志，你想想，祖国被人分成两半，家庭被人分成两半，这是什么滋味？我能安安静静地睡好觉吗？我屡次提出回到南方参加战斗，同志们安慰我，劝解我，叫我把对敌人的仇恨变成力量，好好在北方搞社会主义建设。这话也对。我恨不得把自己的全副力量都使出去。我经常想：我究竟如何做，才能对得起正在南方浴血战斗的同胞们呢？才能不愧是一个南方人呢？我只要这样一想，就什么也不害怕，把命豁出去也行。……”
    说到这里，黄玉足同志把他父母和妻子的照片拿给我们看。并且告诉我们，这些照片是一九五八年从家乡秘密捎来的。从那以后又是音讯杳然，大家看后，感情越发沉重起来。
    黄玉足同志收起照片，沉了好大一会儿，才继续说：
    “我们一定要保卫北方，解放南方。我们统一祖国的意志，是任何力量也阻止不住的。六月四日，敌人轰炸了我们的电厂。奇怪的是，有些外国记者，竟把我们的荣市说成是如何如何荒凉了。当时，我们工人听说这事非常气愤，七号就让电灯亮起来了。让大家都来看看吧，我们的荣市究竟是一座什么城市！”
    提起这事，大家纷纷补充说，那些记者来到这里的时候，这个电厂其实还没有被炸，只不过为了防空的关系，路灯比平时少一些罢了。
    “还有怪事哩。”另一个同志气愤地说，“他们在前面一个地方，还叫我们的战士坐下，把步枪懒散地靠着肩头，装出愁容满面的样子，来拍一张照片。当时，战士非常愤慨，对这个记者说：‘我们越南的战士没有这种姿态！你要看我们的姿态，就到高射炮阵地去看，就在敌机飞来的时候去看！’……”
    其实，这些丑事，我也听到不少。有的苏联记者到越南“访问”，除了吹嘘对越南的援助，就是给越南人民泄气。他们到处散布战争恐怖。说什么从荣市到河内以北的道路上，“汽车司机、摆渡水手、旅客、行人等纷纷死在美国的炸弹和子弹之下”，“天空上布满了‘空对地’火箭的令人眼花缭乱的光芒”，说什么“道路在轰炸中震动了半小时之久”等等。而且在散布战争恐怖时采取了极其狡猾的手法。例如在东京出丑的那个茹科夫，他那篇关于清化的通讯，表面上好象是批评麦克纳马拉轰炸非军事目标，实际上却是借这个题目大肆宣扬战争的“惨状”。说这个越南人“弹片穿透了肺部”，那个越南人“锁骨被火箭片击碎”，再不就是“被炸弹炸断了两腿”。这些先生们究竟要干什么？他们不是明明在那里配合美国强盗飞机的啸声，来吓唬越南人民吗！可耻的是，他们不但用自己的笔来污蔑英雄的越南人民，还要造出一张越南战士的垂头丧气的照片，用来说明越南人民的反侵略战争，是没有意义的，没有前途的。难怪引起越南同志的莫大愤慨。其实，茹科夫想要这样的照片干吗要那样费事呢？他们拍一张自己的照片拿去发表，不是挺合适挺现成的吗！
    傍晚时分，我们结束了这场热烈的谈话。临别之前，发电厂的同志们又紧握着我们的手说：
    “我们向中国同志保证：我们将永远让荣市灯火通明，让电灯照亮每一条大街和小巷！”
    工人同志们，骑上脚踏车在月色中归去。我在村边目送着他们。远处，荣市已经亮起了繁密的灯火，并且隐隐传来欢愉的闹声。在这一霎时，我觉得这些灯火，显得更加灿烂，更加可爱了。在那灯火之间，我仿佛看见黎氏美槐崇高的圣洁的形象，她一手提着铜锣，一手高举着火把，披着长发，高高地立在荣市的上空，那点点的灯火，就好象是她的火把飞出的火星一般……
    我在心里默默地赞颂着：呵，荣市，你有着这样英雄的儿女，我怎能不称你是一座战斗的城，英雄的城！
