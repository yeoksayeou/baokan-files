    The silk mill in Dongcang Street in Suzhou is the Zhenya Silk Weaving Factory, famous in southern Jiangsu. There is a repair workshop in Zhenya Factory. When the workers talk about this workshop, they will give a thumbs up and introduce it to you: It is our factory's little "Daqing"! When this workshop was newly built in 1956, it only had three old machine tools, making it very difficult to manufacture any parts. However, the workers had a revolutionary spirit of daring to break through and work hard. They self-reliantly created earth-made machine tools and new silk machines with a lathe and a hammer, and also created China's first silk clipping machine.
    On the second day of the Lunar New Year, Yu Wulin, the party branch secretary of the repair workshop, and worker Liu Ronggen were on duty in the workshop. Yu Wulin talked about the clipping machine.
    "In my opinion, artificial silk clipping is the weakest link in the factory. Think about it, the current task is quite tight, with twenty silk machines running; but clipping alone requires more than a hundred people, and it's still not enough. I think a clipping machine must be created."
     "Yes! We must try it." Wang Jianzhong, the draftsman beside him, said with confidence.
    After the Spring Festival, Yu Wulin told Cai Lianzheng, the director of the workshop, about the clipping machine. Cai Lianzheng smiled happily when he heard Yu Wulin's proposal to create a clipping machine, saying, "Good! It can be done. But if we want to do it, we must not work behind closed doors as we did in the past. We must open our doors and rely more on the masses."
    A day later, they reported this idea to the factory leaders. Deputy Director Wen Chunlin, nicknamed "Innovation Director," said kindly after listening:
      "Okay! I don't see any problem. To innovate, you must have great ambitions."
    Soon, the innovation group received two pieces of scrap material as experimental supplies. After work that day, Yu Wulin convened a meeting with Cai Lianzheng, Wang Jianzhong, Gu Shanlin, Teng Xinggen, Wu Chengxiu, and others, and everyone discussed it. Some people said: "Even sugar can now be automatically packaged, and Wang Linhe's high-voltage bridge can be manufactured. Can't we mechanize clipping? Yes, we definitely can!"
    Some people also said: "To innovate, you must not be afraid of failure. We must be like Wang Linhe in making a high-voltage bridge, and even if we fail hundreds of times, we must persevere until we succeed."
    Everyone had enough confidence and great enthusiasm, but what kind of clipping machine should be made? Like a flashlight? Or like a hot water bottle? There were no clipping machines in China, and it was said that there were none abroad. Without drawings or materials, where should we start?
    One day after work, Wang Jianzhong found Yu Wulin and Cai Lianzheng and happily said to them: "I've figured it out. Can this clipping machine use the principle of barber's shears?"
      "Yes, let's try it."
    That night, the three of them took a piece of scrap material to a nearby barbershop. The person in charge of the barbershop was very enthusiastic and lent them the shears for testing when they heard that they were borrowing the shears to experiment with a clipping machine. After trying to shear for a while, the fuzz could not be sheared off.
    A few days later, the innovation group held another meeting. At the meeting, some said it should be like a harvester, while others said it should be like a car. Wang Jianzhong's idea based on the principle of manual clipping was praised by everyone. He said: "We can make a knife like a small fish, install it on a drum and move it back and forth, so that the knife can drill into the gap between the silk surface and the fuzz and cut off the fuzz."
    A rough drawing was thus determined. Then, the innovation group visited the velvet cutting machine factory. After the visit, they conducted research and discussion in the conference room of the factory and brewed a set of innovative solutions.
    After returning to the factory, everyone was more confident and enthusiastic. They used the old low silk machine as the frame, used the waste long iron from the warp vehicle to make the track, sharpened the old saw blade into a knife, and found various gears from the waste materials. In this way, they only used a little new material and spent many days of spare time to make the first clipping machine.
    During the initial test, the clipping machine was surrounded by people. Cai Lianzheng turned on the machine, and everyone watched the silk surface nervously. However, after only a few shuttles, there was a no-load phenomenon, and the silk surface was quickly scratched. Everyone said that it was a problem with the knife. Some said it was too sharp, some said it was too blunt, and some said that a safety device should be installed on the knife to prevent the knife edge from scratching the silk surface. According to everyone's opinions, the innovation group asked the forger Gu Desheng to improve the knife shape. After the second test, the silk surface was still scratched. After dozens of continuous improvements, one problem after another was solved, but the problem of scratching the silk surface frequently was still not solved.
    In order to make the clipping machine as soon as possible, Deputy Director Wen Chunlin often researched and discussed with the workers; Yu Wulin and Cai Lianzheng led the way day and night, regardless of hardship; Teng Xinggen and Gu Shanlin specially moved into the workshop dormitory to live with Wang Jianzhong, in order to squeeze out more time to study and discuss; many workers also extended a hand of friendship to the comrades of the innovation group: carpenter Zhu Fengliang and Shen Yongyuan took time to help process the frame, forger Gu Desheng and Zhu Haigen often came at night to help make and grind knives, and turner Chen Sumei and others helped process various parts in accordance with quality, quantity, and time. A common purpose tightly connected their hearts.
    The experiment failed again. Cai Lianzheng stared blankly at the disassembled knife, thinking, and suddenly thought: Our knife is too sharp, and it will scratch the silk surface as soon as it touches it, just like the sharp chicken beak eating, it is easy to peck holes. If it is like the flat oval duck bill, it may not scratch the silk surface... So he asked Master Gu Desheng to make a duckbill-shaped knife from waste materials and put it on the car to try it. It worked! It could clip one or two meters; later, after several improvements and improvements, it could slowly clip the fuzz on the entire piece of silk. China's first silk clipping machine was born in Suzhou Zhenya Silk Weaving Factory.

    丝绸剪花机的诞生
    江宗荣
    姑苏城东仓街上有个规模挺大的绸厂，它就是闻名江南的振亚丝织厂。振亚厂里有一个修配车间。职工们说起这个车间就会翘起大拇指头来向你介绍：它是我们厂里的小“大庆”呢！这个车间在一九五六年新建的时候，只有三台旧机床，要制造什么零件都很困难。但是工人们有一股敢闯敢干的革命精神，一车刀，一榔头，自力更生地造出了一台台土机床，一批批新绸机，还造出了我国第一台丝绸剪花机。
    农历年初二这天，修配车间党支部书记俞武林和工人柳荣根正在车间里值班，俞武林谈到了剪花机的事儿。
    “我看呀，如今厂里人工剪花，这是一道最薄弱的环节。你想想，眼前任务相当紧张，有二十台绸机在开动；可是单剪花的却要一百多人，而且还来不及。剪花机，我看必须想法搞出来。”
     “是呀！我们一定试试。”一旁的绘图员王建中满有信心地说。
    春节过后，俞武林便把搞剪花机的事告诉了车间主任蔡连正。蔡连正听到俞武林提出要搞剪花机，高兴地笑着说：“好！这能搞。但是要搞，决不能象过去那样关着门搞，要开门搞，多依靠群众。”
    隔了一天，他们就把这个想法向厂领导作了汇报。外号叫“革新厂长”的副厂长文春林听后，亲切地说：
      “行啊！我看没啥问题。搞革新就要有雄心壮志。”
    不久，革新小组领到两块零料作为试验用品。当天下班后，俞武林就召集蔡连正、王建中、顾善林、滕兴根、吴澄修等人开了个碰头会，大家议论纷纷。有人说：“现在连糖都能自动包装，王林鹤高压电桥也能制造成，难道我们剪花就不能机械化吗？能，一定能！”
    也有人说：“搞革新就要不怕失败。我们要象王林鹤搞出高压电桥一样，即使失败几百次，也要坚持下去，直到成功为止。”
    大家的信心是足的，劲头是大的，但是要搞的剪花机是什么样子的？象手电筒那样呢？还是象热水袋？剪花机国内没有，听说国外也没有，没有图纸，没有资料，从哪里着手搞呢？
    有一天下班后，王建中找到俞武林、蔡连正，高兴地对他们说：“我想出来了，这剪花机是不是可以利用理发轧剪的原理呢？”
      “是呀，我们去试试。”
    夜里，他们三人便带了一块零料来到附近的一家理发店里。理发店的负责人一听他们是为了搞剪花机来借轧剪试验的，就很热情地借给了他们。试轧了一会儿，毛丝轧不下。
    没过几天，革新小组又开碰头会。在会上，有的说最好象割稻机那样，也有的说最好象小汽车那样。王建中根据手工剪花的原理，想出的办法得到了大家的赞扬。他说：“可以打把象鳑皮鱼那样的刀，把它装在滚筒上往返运动，这样能使刀钻进绸面与毛丝之间的空隙，把毛丝剪掉。”
    一个大致的图样就这样定下来了。接着，革新小组又来到新光漳绒厂参观割绒机。参观后，他们就在新光厂的会议室里进行研究、议论，酝酿出了一套革新方案。
    回厂后，大家的信心更足，劲头更大。他们用旧的矮绸机作为机架，用纤经车上不用的废旧长铁做成了道轨，用旧锯条磨成了刀，又从废旧材料里找出了各种各样的齿轮。就是这样，他们只利用很少一点新料，花费了好多天业余时间，制成了第一台剪花机。
    初次试验时，剪花机旁围满了人。蔡连正将机子一开动，大家都紧张地望着绸面。可是只剪了几梭，就产生了空转现象，很快地把绸面划破了。大家一看，都说是刀上的毛病，有的人说太尖，有的人说太钝，也有的人说刀上要装个保险，这样可以避免刀口将绸面划破。根据大家的意见，革新小组请锻工顾德生将刀型作了改进，再次试验，仍然划破绸面。又经过几十次的不断改进，一个个问题都解决了，就是经常划破绸面的问题还得不到解决。
    为了使剪花机早日搞成，副厂长文春林经常同工人们一起研究、商量；俞武林、蔡连正不分昼夜，不怕艰苦，处处带头；滕兴根、顾善林特地搬进车间宿舍里来，与王建中同住在一起，好挤出更多的时间来钻研商量；许多工人也都向革新小组的同志们伸出了友谊之手：木工朱凤良、沈永源抽出时间帮助加工机架，锻工顾德生、朱海根常常夜里赶来帮助打刀、磨刀，车工陈素梅等按质按量按时地帮助加工各种零件。一个共同的目的，把他们的心紧紧地连在一起。
    试验又失败了。蔡连正呆呆地对着拆下的刀看啊、想啊，忽然想到：我们的刀是太尖，一碰到绸面就要划破，就象尖尖的鸡嘴吃食一样，容易啄洞，要是象扁圆形的鸭嘴那样，就可能不会把绸面划破……于是他请顾德生师傅用废旧材料打了一把鸭嘴形的刀，装上车去一试，行了，可以剪一、两米了；以后，又经过几次改进、提高，就慢慢能剪整匹绸上的毛丝了。我国第一台丝绸剪花机，就是这样在苏州振亚丝织厂里诞生了。
