　　An American Soldier Awakens During the War of Aggression Against Vietnam
    Former U.S. Army Sergeant Duncan said: The soldiers of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front fought the way they did because they were fighting for national independence; while the U.S. military was not maintaining freedom in South Vietnam, and there was no freedom to maintain at all.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, New York: The February 12th issue of the "National Vanguard" weekly recommended and excerpted an article by recently retired former U.S. Army Sergeant Donald Duncan, exposing the crimes of the U.S. military in the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    Duncan's article originally appeared in the February issue of the American Catholic magazine "Ramparts."
    The "National Vanguard" weekly wrote in its introduction: "U.S. Army Sergeant Donald Duncan left the army in September 1965 after spending ten years in the U.S. military. He spent six years of his army life in the Special Forces, and the last eighteen months in South Vietnam. Last March, he was promoted to captain in the field, but he refused to accept. He left South Vietnam on September 5 and returned to the United States. Since September 9, he has been a civilian again. What prompted him to make this decision? He talks about his experiences in the February issue of 'Ramparts' magazine."
    The following is an abstract of Duncan's article as relayed by the weekly:
    Special Forces soldiers were trained in methods of torture and were particularly indoctrinated to believe that communism and communist countries are the enemy.
    He, like his fellow soldiers, entered Vietnam in plain clothes in March 1964, and he quickly understood the following facts:
    American officers and sergeants looked down on the Vietnamese. They called them "country bumpkins." With few exceptions, black American soldiers ran the risk of being kicked out if they entered "white" bars. The vast majority of people's attitude toward the Vietnamese was: "arrogance, rudeness, brutality, prejudice, and ignorance."
    The so-called news that the National Liberation Front took "terrorist actions" against its own people was fabricated by the U.S.-Saigon Command. The murdered "village chiefs" were traitors, or were imported from outside when local people could not find running dogs.
    The soldiers of the National Liberation Front fought that way (if the U.S. military headquarters hated them, they also respected them) because he believed in his cause: "He believes he is fighting for national independence. He trusts his leaders... while the government army (referring to the Saigon puppet army) knows that his superiors are officials because of family, money, or rewards for his political actions. He knows that his superiors are primarily concerned with making money and gaining favor." They embezzled the salaries of their subordinates, lived in luxurious villas with their mistresses, negotiated with the National Liberation Front to avoid fighting, and allowed their troops to rob, rape, and kill. In stark contrast, the National Liberation Front helped plant and harvest crops every time it passed through a village. People voluntarily provided them with food and lodging.
      The "Ho Chi Minh Trail" and the traffic situation on this trail have been greatly exaggerated: most of the Viet Cong's weapons are obtained from (Saigon army) and from the sea... The Viet Cong are mainly South Vietnamese, not troops transported from the North.
    The headquarters was a mess, both stupid and lacking in communication; this put the U.S. military in a very dangerous state, even allowing the Liberation Front to know in advance that it was going to launch an attack. After the battle, the estimates of enemy casualties were greatly exaggerated, once even saying that about six dead and wounded were two hundred and fifty people.
    Duncan understood that any uprising or guerrilla movement cannot persist without the support of the people. He said, "I found that in every province, the Viet Cong guerrillas started from small units. They have now expanded to battalions and regiments. Before I left, the Viet Cong was able to put division-sized forces into the battlefield in almost any province. This development is not only impossible without the support of the people, but it must actually receive the great trust of the people."
    Eighteen months later, Duncan concluded that everything was a lie. He said, "We are not maintaining freedom in South Vietnam. There is no freedom to maintain at all. Opposition to the government means imprisonment or death... What we bring to South Vietnam is not democracy, but anti-communism. This is the only choice offered to the rural residents. This is why most of them welcome the Viet Cong... It is American anti-communist bombs that kill their children. It is American anti-communism that supports one dictator after another in Saigon."

　　一个美国军人在侵越战争中醒悟过来
    前美军军士长邓肯说：南越民族解放阵线的战士所以那样作战，是因为他们是为民族独立而战：而美军并不是在南越维护自由，根本就没有任何自由可维护。
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：二月十二日一期《国民前卫》周报推荐并摘要转述了新近退伍的前美军军士长唐纳德·邓肯写的一篇揭露侵越美军罪行的文章。
    邓肯的文章原来刊载在美国天主教会出版的《堡垒》杂志二月号上。
    《国民前卫》周报在介绍中写道：“美国陆军军士长唐纳德·邓肯在美军呆了十年之后在一九六五年九月离开了军队。
      他有六年的军队生活是在特种部队中度过的，最后十八个月是在南越。
    去年三月，在阵前被提升为上尉，但是他拒绝接受。他在九月五日离开南越回美国。自九月九日起，他又成了一个非军人。
    是什么促使他作出这个决定的呢？他在二月号的《堡垒》杂志上谈了他的经历。”
    下面是这家周报转述的邓肯这篇文章的摘要：
    特种部队的士兵受到了施酷刑方法的训练，并且，特别被灌输说，共产主义和共产党国家是敌人。
    他象他的士兵伙伴们一样，是身穿便服于一九六四年三月进入越南的，他很快就明白了以下的事实：
    美国军官和军士都瞧不起越南人。骂他们是“乡巴佬”。除了少数例外，美国黑人士兵跑进“白人”酒巴间，就有被赶出来的危险。绝大多数人对越南人的态度是：“狂妄、无礼、粗暴、偏见和无知”。
    所谓民族解放阵线对自己的人民采取“恐怖行动”的消息是美国—西贡司令部编造出来的。被杀掉的“乡长”是卖国贼，或者是在当地人民中物色不到走狗时从外边输入的走狗。
    民族解放阵线的战士所以那样作战（如果说美军指挥部是恨他们的，但却也敬重他们）是因为他相信自己的事业：“他相信，他是为民族独立而战的。他信任他的领导人……而政府军（按指西贡傀儡军）知道，他的上级所以当官是由于家庭、金钱或者是对他的政治行动的酬报。他知道，他的长官主要关心的是发财和得宠”。他们克扣部下的军饷，同他们的情妇住在豪华的别墅里，他们同民族解放阵线讲交易以避免作战，并且听任他们的部下去抢劫、强奸和杀人。同这种情况恰恰相反，民族解放阵线每穿越一个村子都要帮忙种庄稼和收庄稼。人们自愿地给他们提供吃、住。
      “胡志明小道”和这条小道上的交通情况被大大夸大了：越共大部分武器是从（西贡军队）那里和从海上获得的……越共主要是南越人，不是从北方运进来的军队。
    司令部内是一团糟，既愚蠢又缺乏联络；这使美军处于非常危险的状态，甚至使解放阵线预先知道它要进行袭击。战斗之后，对敌军伤亡数字的估计是大大夸大的，有一次竟把死伤六人左右说成二百五十人。
    邓肯懂得了：任何起义或者游击运动，没有人民的支持是不能坚持下去的。他说：“我发现在各个省份里，越共游击队都是从小部队开始的。它们现在已经扩大到成营成团了。在我离开之前，越共已经能够在几乎任何省把成师的兵力投入战场。这种发展如果没有人民的支持，不仅是不可能的，而且它实际上还必须得到人民极大的信托。”
    十八个月后，邓肯断定一切都是谎言。他说，“我们并不是在南越维护自由。根本就没有任何自由可维护。反对政府就意味着坐牢或者死亡……我们带给南越的并不是民主，而是反共主义。这是供乡村居民的唯一抉择。这就是他们大多数人欢迎越共的原因……杀死他们的孩子的是美国的反共炸弹。支持西贡一个又一个独裁者的是美国的反共主义。”
