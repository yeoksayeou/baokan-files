    Comparing ourselves, where are we inferior to Jiao Yulu?
    At two o'clock in the morning on February 9th, after reading the article "The Model of a County Party Secretary - Jiao Yulu", I was moved by the selfless spirit of the great Communist Jiao Yulu. I could not sleep for a long time, and repeatedly thought about how to learn from his revolutionary spirit, improve the fighting power of the Pinggu County Party organization, and accelerate the construction of a new socialist countryside.
    To learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, we must first learn from his revolutionary spirit. The revolutionary spirit of the people in a county depends first on the county's core of Party leadership – the County Party Committee. The revolutionary spirit of the County Party Committee depends first on the County Party Secretary. As Comrade Jiao Yulu thought: "When the masses are in disaster, they look to the County Party Committee. If the County Party Committee cannot stand tall, the masses cannot be fully mobilized. 'If the cadres do not lead, the water buffalo will fall into the well.' If we want to change the face of Lankao, we must first change the spiritual state of the County Party Committee." The change in the spiritual outlook of the Lankao County Party Committee was first initiated by Comrade Jiao Yulu. Under his leadership, the people of Lankao overcame the "three evils" of water, sand, and alkali. We must learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of taking the lead in revolution, leading the people of Pinggu County to overcome drought and strive for a greater agricultural harvest.
    Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of going deep into the masses to investigate and research. If you want to eliminate the enemy, you cannot do it without knowing the enemy's situation; if you want to change the natural appearance of a county, it is also impossible without understanding the laws of nature. In Lankao County, with the personal participation of Comrade Jiao Yulu, they traveled more than 5,000 li in the spring and summer, and finally the County Party Committee grasped first-hand information about the "three evils" in Lankao County. They paid a considerable price of labor, which is essential. The greater the price paid in this regard, the more confident we will be in achieving victory in socialist construction.
    The real creators of history are the masses of the people. Only through in-depth investigation and research can we discover the creations of the people. Comrade Jiao Yulu, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, went deep into the masses and discovered the disaster-resistant experiences of the four villages of Hancun, Qinzhai, Zhaoduolou, and Shuangyangshu. He summarized these revolutionary things of the masses into four sentences: "The spirit of Hancun, the determination of Qinzhai, the drive of Zhaoduolou, and the road of Shuangyangshu." They held high these four banners of disaster resistance armed with Mao Zedong Thought, which generated infinite power. The people of Pinggu County also have a spirit of creation, but we have not fully utilized this spirit of creation, mainly because our County Party Committee does not have enough spirit to go deep into the masses to investigate and research. Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, we are far behind. In order to accelerate the change in the appearance of Pinggu County, we must work hard in this regard.
    Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of appearing in front of the masses when they are in difficulty. Class struggle and production struggle will not be smooth sailing. There will be various difficulties on the revolutionary road. Communists must stand in front of the masses and lead them forward when they are in difficulty. This is Chairman Mao's teaching. Comrade Jiao Yulu did it according to Chairman Mao's teachings, which brought infinite power to the people of Lankao County in their struggle against disasters. If we also do as Comrade Jiao Yulu did, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, it will also bring infinite power to the people of Pinggu County to overcome nature. We must mobilize all Party members in Pinggu County to seriously study Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit.
    Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's ability to be a good "squad leader." Individual wisdom is limited, but collective wisdom is infinite. To be a good "squad leader" of the County Party Secretary, we must first mobilize the enthusiasm of the County Party Committee members, and then we can mobilize the enthusiasm of the whole Party and the whole people. To be a good "squad leader," the County Party Secretary must be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, not impose his own opinions on others, and be good at persuading comrades with different opinions to work together. However, some of our comrades are not like this. They are not democratic in their work, and they make decisions on their own. Or they simply punish some comrades for their mistakes, or they do not adhere to principles when they see that some comrades have made mistakes. This was a fatal weakness in our past work, and it has not been completely eradicated now. In the future, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, learn Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of promoting democracy, adhering to principles, adhering to unity, and adhering to struggle, unite the County Party Committee members, unite the whole Party, unite the whole people, and overcome all difficulties on the revolutionary road.
    Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's selfless spirit of "having all the people in his heart, and only not himself." If we want to do a good job in socialist construction in a county and change its natural appearance, we must always have the people in our hearts. Without this spirit, serving the people is just empty talk. Comrade Jiao Yulu was still thinking about all the people in his heart when he was dying, which is very touching. We must organize the whole Party to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people.
    The appearance of Pinggu County has changed a lot in the past three years, but our work is still far from the requirements of the Party and the people, and the change in the rural appearance is not fast enough. Why? The most fundamental reason is that our County Party Committee has not studied Chairman Mao's works as seriously as Comrade Jiao Yulu did, and has not gone deep into the masses to investigate and research as seriously as Comrade Jiao Yulu did, and has not summarized and promoted the inventions and creations of the people in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. We must always remember these two lessons. We must seriously study Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit, accelerate the speed of socialist construction in our county's countryside, and strive for a greater agricultural harvest.

### 比一比，在哪些地方不如焦裕禄

    比一比，在哪些地方不如焦裕禄
    二月九日凌晨二时，我读完了《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》这篇文章之后，被焦裕禄同志的伟大共产党人忘我精神所感动，久久不能入睡，再三思索如何学习他的革命精神，提高平谷县党组织的战斗力，加快社会主义新农村的建设速度。
    学习焦裕禄同志首先要学习他的革命精神。一个县的人民群众革命精神如何，首先要看这个县的党的领导核心——县委，县委的革命精神首先要看县委书记。这正如焦裕禄同志所想的：“群众在灾难中两眼望着县委，县委挺不起腰杆，群众就不能充分发动起来。‘干部不领，水牛掉井’，要想改变兰考的面貌，必须首先改变县委的精神状态。”兰考县委精神面貌的改变，首先是焦裕禄同志带起来的。在他的带动下，兰考人民战胜了水、沙、碱“三害”。我们要学习焦裕禄同志这种带头革命精神，带领平谷县人民战胜干旱，争取农业更大丰收。
    学习焦裕禄同志深入群众调查研究的精神。要想消灭敌人，不把敌人情况摸清是没有办法的；要想把一个县的自然面貌改观，不摸清自然规律也同样是不行的。兰考县在焦裕禄同志亲自参加下，用了一春、一夏的时间，方圆跋涉五千余里，终于使县委抓到了兰考县“三害”的第一手资料。他们付出了相当大的劳动代价，这种代价是不可少的。在这方面付出的代价越大，我们在社会主义建设中就能够越有把握地取得胜利。
    历史的真正创造者是人民群众，只有深入调查研究才能发现人民群众的创造。焦裕禄同志按着毛主席教导，深入群众发现了韩村、秦寨、赵垛楼、双杨树四个村的抗灾经验，他把群众这些革命的东西，集中起来总结为四句话：“韩村的精神，秦寨的决心，赵垛楼的干劲，双杨树的道路。”他们高举这四面毛泽东思想武装起来的抗灾旗帜，产生了无穷的力量。我们平谷县的人民同样是有创造精神的，但是我们还没有使这种创造精神充分发挥作用，主要是我们县委深入群众调查研究精神不够。和焦裕禄同志比起来，相差十万八千里。为了加速改变平谷县面貌，我们必须在这方面狠下工夫。
    学习焦裕禄同志在群众困难的时候出现在群众面前的精神。阶级斗争和生产斗争都不会是一帆风顺的，革命道路会出现这样和那样的困难，共产党员就是要在群众困难的时候站在前边率领群众前进，是毛主席的教导。焦裕禄同志就是按照毛主席教导去做了，因而给兰考县人民抗灾斗争带来了无穷的力量。如果我们也象焦裕禄同志那样按毛主席教导去做，同样会给平谷县人民战胜大自然带来无穷力量。我们要发动平谷县全体党员认真学习焦裕禄同志这种精神。
    学习焦裕禄同志善于当“班长”。个人的智慧是有限的，集体的智慧是无穷的。当好县委书记这个“班长”，必须首先把县委委员的积极性调动起来，然后才能调动全党全民的积极性。县委书记要当好“班长”，就得象焦裕禄同志那样，不把自己的意见强加于人，善于说服和自己意见不同的同志一起工作，而我们有的同志就不是这样，工作中不民主，个人说了算，或是对有些同志的错误单纯的惩罚，或是见到某些同志有错误不坚持原则。这是我们过去工作中的一个致命的弱点，现在也还没有完全根除。今后我们要遵循毛主席的教导，好好学习焦裕禄同志发扬民主、坚持原则、坚持团结、坚持斗争的精神，团结好县委委员，团结好全党，团结好全民，战胜革命道路上的一切困难。
    学习焦裕禄同志“心里装着全体人民，唯独没有他自己”的忘我精神。要想把一个县的社会主义建设搞好，改变自然面貌，就必须心里时时刻刻想着人民。没有这种精神，为人民服务就是一句空话。焦裕禄同志临死时心里还想着全体人民，使人十分感动。我们要组织全党学习焦裕禄同志这种一心为人民的精神。
    平谷县的面貌近三年有了很大变化，但是我们的工作离党和人民的要求还相差很远，农村面貌改变的还不够快。为什么？最根本的原因是我们县委还没有象焦裕禄同志那样认真学好毛主席著作，没有象焦裕禄同志那样认真的深入群众调查研究，总结推广人民群众在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中的发明创造。我们要时刻记住这两条经验教训。认真学习焦裕禄同志的革命精神，加快我县农村社会主义建设的速度，争取农业更大丰收。
