　　Throw Away the Shield, Catch Up Head-On
    In the past, I did not follow Chairman Mao's teachings and use the "one divides into two" perspective to view Luodian, unilaterally believing that Luodian was a remote and backward area, everything was backward, and would always be backward, thus losing confidence. Now, Comrade Jiao Yulu has blazed a trail for us: as long as we highlight politics, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, constantly transform ourselves, improve our work, and we can have confidence in changing the backward situation.
    Taking Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror, I have compared and examined my own thinking and work, and the more I compare, the greater the gap.
    The natural conditions of Luodian County are no worse than those of Lankao, but the impoverished state has not fundamentally changed. This is largely related to the fact that the thinking of the county party committee leadership has not been thoroughly revolutionized. I myself had wrong views on Luodian in the past, believing that Luodian was a remote minority area, with a poor foundation, backward work, and complex situation, and that no work could be compared with other places or with the central areas. You can’t compare loach with eels. Therefore, even though I have been working in Luodian for more than three years, I still have not truly established the lofty ambition to change Luodian's appearance. The work is generally average, and the achievements are not outstanding. When I see that the work of other counties has progressed, instead of feeling anxious and trying to find ways to catch up, I think that Luodian's conditions are poor, and it is better to take it slowly and be "stable". When the work falls behind and is criticized by higher authorities, instead of examining it subjectively, I develop a mood of resentment towards heaven and earth. I often use "Luodian's backwardness" as an excuse, as a shield to forgive myself, to defend myself, and to cover up my lack of revolutionary spirit and insufficient drive. When higher authorities assign tasks, I emphasize that it is a remote and backward area, and the tasks should be less; when higher authorities allocate materials, I emphasize that it is a minority area, and the materials should be more and receive preferential treatment. In essence, this is the conservative thinking of relying on the care of higher authorities replacing the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance.
    How to deal with backwardness and difficulties? Comrade Jiao Yulu adopted a completely different attitude from us. In times of serious difficulties, he could see great hope for Lankao, mobilize the people of the whole county to actively develop production, and create favorable conditions. As for me, in the past, I did not use the "one divides into two" perspective to look at Luodian, unilaterally and wrongly believing that Luodian was all backward, would always be backward, lost confidence, and lacked drive. In my work, I often regard some backward habits that are not conducive to production and the consolidation of the collective economy as problems belonging to the habits of ethnic minorities, and dare not revolutionize the life of backward habits. For example, in many areas of our county, the situation of "no toilets for people and no pens for livestock" has existed for a long time, and in some areas, for one or two months after the Spring Festival, it is necessary to "avoid thunder" (one thunder strike requires avoiding work for three to five days). For these problems, I did not, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, go deep into reality, investigate and research, grasp first-hand materials, make correct judgments, and with a revolutionary attitude and determination, adhere to the mass line method, and gradually change it. Chairman Mao said that the essence of the national question is the class question. I often cannot use the class viewpoint to analyze the national question, correctly distinguish between the national customs that must be respected and the backward habits that should be reformed, and I dare not change the backward habits on the pretext of being afraid of making mistakes.
    Why do I have the above wrong ideas? The main reason is that I have not, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, highlighted politics in my actual work, creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, put Mao Zedong Thought in command everywhere, and constantly transformed myself with Mao Zedong Thought. Ideologically, the word "I" is in the lead, and the word "difficult" prevails, fearing this and fearing that; work is afraid of hardship and difficulties, the style is not deep enough, hard and practical, in short, there is a lack of lofty ambitions to change the backward appearance of the Luodian mountainous area.
    Now, Comrade Jiao Yulu has blazed a trail for us. I must take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, always remember Chairman Mao's teachings on "the struggle of the proletariat and the revolutionary people to transform the world includes the task of realizing the following: transforming the objective world, and also transforming one's own subjective world - transforming one's own cognitive ability, transforming the relationship between the subjective world and the objective world," establishing a completely and thoroughly world outlook of serving the people, earnestly reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, doing things according to Chairman Mao's instructions, taking Chairman Mao's works as the highest instructions for all tasks, doing a good job, and constantly transforming myself. Earnestly learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit of dedicating himself to the people, learn from his revolutionary thinking of seeing hope and brightness in difficulties, seeing advanced in backwardness, and seeing favorable conditions in unfavorable conditions. With a tenacious revolutionary spirit, we will firmly grasp the ideological work of the people, and are determined to completely change the backward appearance of Luodian in a short period of time.

　　丢掉挡箭牌　迎头赶上去
    过去，没有遵照毛主席的教导，用一分为二的观点看罗甸，片面地认为罗甸是边远落后地区，一切落后，永远落后，丧失信心；现在，焦裕禄同志给我们闯出了一条路子，只要突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，不断改造自己，改进工作，改变落后面貌是有信心的
    我以焦裕禄同志为镜子，对照检查了自己的思想和工作，越对照差距越大。
    罗甸县的自然条件不比兰考差，但是穷困的面貌一直没有从根本上改变。这与县委领导思想没有彻底革命化有很大关系。我自己过去对罗甸就有错误的看法，认为罗甸是边远少数民族地区，基础差，工作落后，情况复杂，什么工作都不能与外地比，不能与中心地区比。泥鳅黄鳝那能一般齐。因此，我调到罗甸工作已经三年多了，仍然没有真正树立起改变罗甸面貌的雄心壮志。工作一般化，成绩不突出。看到其他县的工作前进了，不但不感到着急，想办法鼓足干劲追上去，反而认为罗甸条件差，还是慢慢来，“稳”一点好。工作掉了队，受到上级批评，不但不从主观上去检查，反而产生怨天怨地的情绪。往往拿“罗甸落后”作为借口，作为挡箭牌原谅自己，替自己辩护，掩盖自己的革命精神不振、干劲不足。上级分配任务，强调边远落后地区，任务应该少给；上级分配物资，却强调少数民族地区，物资应该多给，优先照顾。实质上，这是依靠上级照顾的保守思想代替了艰苦奋斗自力更生的革命精神。
    怎样对待落后和困难？焦裕禄同志采取了与我们截然不同的态度。他在严重困难的时候，能看到兰考大有希望，发动全县人民积极发展生产，创造有利条件。而我呢，过去没有用一分为二的观点来看罗甸，片面地错误地认为罗甸一切落后，永远落后，丧失信心，缺乏干劲。在工作中往往把一些不利于生产、不利于巩固集体经济的落后习惯，都看成是属于少数民族习惯的问题，不敢革掉落后习惯的命。比如我县不少地区长期存在着“人无厕所、畜无圈”的状况，有的地区春节过后一二个月中要“忌雷”（打一次雷要忌三五天不出工）等。对于这些问题，我不是象焦裕禄同志那样，深入实际、调查研究，掌握第一手材料，作出正确判断，以革命的态度和决心，坚持群众路线的方法，去逐步地改变它。毛主席说过民族问题实质上是阶级问题。我往往不能用阶级观点去分析民族问题，正确地区分必须尊重的民族习惯和应当改革的落后习惯，而以怕犯错误为借口，不敢去改变落后的习惯。
    我为什么会存在以上错误思想呢？主要原因是没有象焦裕禄同志那样，在实际工作中突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，处处以毛泽东思想挂帅，用毛泽东思想不断改造自己。在思想上，“我”字当头，“难”字占上风，怕这怕那；工作怕艰苦、怕困难，作风不够深入、艰苦踏实，总之，对改变罗甸山区的落后面貌缺乏雄心壮志。
    现在，焦裕禄同志给我们闯出了一条路子。我一定要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，时刻记住毛主席关于“无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述的任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界——改造自己的认识能力，改造主观世界同客观世界的关系”的教导，树立完全、彻底地为人民服务的世界观，认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，把毛主席著作当作各项工作的最高指示，做好工作，不断改造自己。认真学习焦裕禄同志为人民鞠躬尽瘁的革命精神，学习他从困难中看到希望，看到光明，从落后中看到先进，从不利条件中看到有利条件的革命思想。以顽强的革命精神，狠抓人的思想工作，决心在不长的时间内彻底改变罗甸的落后面貌。
