　　Arsonist's Excuse
　　By a Commentator of this newspaper
    U.S. Democratic Senator Stuart Symington, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently released his "inspection report" on South Vietnam, claiming that Cambodia has been "utilized" by the "Viet Cong" as a "sanctuary." On the 24th, the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a government statement, angrily condemning U.S. imperialism for fabricating excuses to expand its war of aggression into Cambodia, and expressing Cambodia's determination to repel all attacks on its territory. The 650 million Chinese people resolutely support this solemn stance of the Royal Government of Cambodia.
    The Johnson government, this arsonist, always concocts one excuse or another as a pretext for aggression and expansion. It was like this when it launched a "special war" in South Vietnam. It was also like this when it wantonly bombed North Vietnam and expanded its war of aggression in South Vietnam. In order to salvage its defeat on the South Vietnam battlefield, the U.S. aggressors have long been clamoring about "pursuing the communist forces," and that the "Viet Cong" should not be allowed to "utilize" Cambodian territory, etc., in order to further expand the flames of war in Indochina. Symington's "report" merely exposes more clearly this sinister plan of the Johnson government.
    In fact, the United States has been stepping up its violations and threats against Cambodia recently. U.S. B-52s and other types of bandit aircraft have repeatedly invaded Cambodian airspace. U.S. imperialism has also directed its Thai puppet troops and South Vietnamese puppet troops to constantly violate Cambodian territorial waters and airspace, and shell Cambodian outposts. These are all serious provocations by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs against Cambodia.
    Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, and the Royal Government of Cambodia have repeatedly declared that Cambodia is determined to take a tooth-for-a-tooth stance against any aggression by the heinous enemy, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and to fight to the final victory to safeguard its independence, neutrality, and territorial integrity. The Cambodian people are a heroic people. The Cambodian people have already achieved continuous victories in their struggle against aggression, and will surely achieve even greater victories. The Chinese people are closely watching the development of the situation in Indochina, and reiterate: We firmly stand on the side of the Cambodian people and fully support the just struggle of the Cambodian people against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

　　纵火犯的借口
　　本报评论员
    美国民主党参议员、参议院武装部队委员会和参议院外交委员会委员斯图尔特·薛明顿，最近公布了他在南越的“视察报告”，说什么柬埔寨已被“越共”利用作为
  “庇护所”。二十四日，柬埔寨王国政府发表政府声明，愤怒谴责美帝国主义为把侵略战争扩大到柬埔寨制造借口，表示柬埔寨决心回击对自己领土的一切进攻。六亿五千万中国人民坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府的这一严正立场。
    约翰逊政府这个纵火犯，为了进行侵略和扩张，总是要编造这样或那样的托辞作为借口。它在南越发动“特种战争”的时候，是这样。它对越南北方狂轰滥炸并扩大在南越的侵略战争的时候，也是这样。美国侵略者为了挽救南越战场的败局，早就在不断叫嚷什么要“追击共产党部队”，什么不容许“越共”“利用”柬埔寨的领土，等等，以便在印度支那进一步扩大战火。薛明顿的“报告”，不过是更明显地暴露了约翰逊政府的这一阴谋计划。
    事实上，最近一个时期以来，美国就一直在加紧对柬埔寨的侵犯和威胁。美国B—52型和其他类型的强盗飞机曾经多次入侵柬埔寨领空。美帝国主义还指使泰国仆从军和南越傀儡军不断地侵犯柬埔寨的领海和领空，炮击柬埔寨哨所。这都是美帝国主义及其走狗对柬埔寨的严重挑衅。
    柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨王国政府已经多次申明，对于万恶的敌人美帝国主义及其走狗的任何侵略，柬埔寨决心采取以牙还牙的立场，为维护自己的独立、中立和领土完整战斗到最后胜利。柬埔寨人民是英勇的人民。柬埔寨人民在抗击侵略的斗争中已经取得不断的胜利，并且必将取得更大的胜利。中国人民正密切注视印度支那局势的发展，并且重申：我们坚定地站在柬埔寨人民这一边，全力支援柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的正义斗争。
