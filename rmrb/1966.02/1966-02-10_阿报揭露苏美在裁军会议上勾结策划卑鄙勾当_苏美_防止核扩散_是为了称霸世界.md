    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 7th: The Albanian newspaper *People's Voice* published a commentary on the Geneva Disarmament Conference on the 6th, exposing the further collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union in planning despicable schemes to deceive world public opinion.

    The commentary said that the Soviet revisionists, together with U.S. imperialism, are attempting to divert world public opinion's attention from the U.S. imperialism's barbaric aggression in Southeast Asia at the Geneva Disarmament Conference. The Khrushchev revisionists claimed in Geneva that the situation in Vietnam is irrelevant to disarmament negotiations. This shows that the Khrushchev revisionists' loud cries of "support and assistance" to the Vietnamese people are merely demagoguery. The only thing the Soviet revisionists are interested in is cozying up to and cooperating with U.S. imperialism so that the two major powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, can dominate the world.

    The commentary pointed out that the representatives of U.S. imperialism and the Khrushchev revisionists at the Geneva Disarmament Conference are trying to create the impression that signing a non-proliferation treaty for nuclear weapons is a step towards disarmament and an effective measure dedicated to maintaining and consolidating peace. But this is completely false and deceptive. Life shows that the U.S. imperialists are carrying out aggression and war. The danger does not come from countries that do not have nuclear weapons, but from imperialist countries that already possess such weapons. A non-proliferation treaty for nuclear weapons can only maintain the nuclear monopoly of the Soviet Union and the United States, and does not help disarmament at all, let alone the real security of the people of all countries. On the contrary, it will only encourage U.S. imperialist aggressors, serve the collaborative policy of the Soviet Union and the United States to dominate the world, and serve the nuclear blackmail policy of the Soviet Union and the United States against the people of all countries.

    阿报揭露苏美在裁军会议上勾结策划卑鄙勾当
    苏美“防止核扩散”是为了称霸世界
    据新华社地拉那七日电  阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》六日就日内瓦裁军会议发表评论，揭露美国、苏联进一步相互勾结，策划欺骗世界舆论的卑鄙勾当。
    评论说，苏联修正主义者和美帝国主义一起在日内瓦裁军会议上企图转移世界公众舆论对美帝国主义野蛮侵略东南亚的注意力。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在日内瓦声称越南局势与裁军谈判无关。这表明，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者“支持和帮助”越南人民的大叫大嚷只是蛊惑人心。苏联修正主义者唯一感兴趣的是靠拢美帝并与之合作，以便苏美两大国主宰世界。
    评论指出，美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在日内瓦裁军会议的代表竭力制造一种印象，似乎签订一个不扩散核武器的协议就是导向裁军，就是致力于维护和巩固和平的有效措施。但这完全是虚假和骗人的。生活表明，美帝国主义者正在进行侵略和战争。危险不来自没有核武器的国家，而是来自已经掌握了这类武器的帝国主义国家。不扩散核武器的协议只能维持苏美的核垄断地位，而根本无助于裁军，更无助于各国人民的真正安全。相反，它只会鼓励美帝国主义侵略者，为苏美称霸世界的配合政策服务，为苏美反对各国人民的核讹诈政策服务。
