　　Lao Patriotic Armed Forces Annihilate Over 300 Enemy Troops at Phou Kout Mountain
　　Recover Some Areas in Luang Prabang Province and Elsewhere Occupied by U.S. Imperialism and its Running Dogs
　　Pathet Lao Radio Refutes Vientiane Authorities' Fabricated Rumors and Strongly Condemns Thai Authorities for Acting as Accomplices of U.S. Aggression in Laos
    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, February 26th (via telephone) -- According to a broadcast by Pathet Lao Radio on February 26th, the Lao Patriotic Armed Forces defending Phou Kout Mountain annihilated a total of 352 enemy troops, shot down seven U.S. aircraft, and seized six artillery pieces, more than sixty various light and heavy machine guns and rifles, and a large quantity of ammunition and military supplies during battles to counterattack the enemy from February 4th to 17th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, February 25th (via telephone) -- According to a broadcast by Pathet Lao Radio, patriotic soldiers and civilians in Luang Prabang Province recovered the Nam Te, Ban He Kan, Nam Xai Liao, Ban Pa Ke and other areas in Ba Sen County that were occupied by the troops of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in early February this year, on February 16th and 17th.
    In the battles to recover these areas, the patriotic soldiers and civilians annihilated 122 enemy troops, seized two artillery pieces, more than seventy various guns, and a large quantity of military supplies.
    The radio station also broadcast that on February 19th, Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians recovered the Tala and Na Kang areas bordering the Xieng Khouang and Houaphan Provinces. In the battles against the reactionary armed forces entrenched in this area, the patriotic soldiers and civilians killed more than 40 enemy troops, captured 27, and seized many weapons and military supplies.
    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, February 26th (via telephone) -- Pathet Lao Radio authorized the issuance of a statement on February 26th, refuting the rumor fabricated by the Vientiane regime that "more than 20,000 North Vietnamese troops have entered Laos."
    The statement pointed out that this is a completely unfounded and shameless fabrication, attempting to cover up the crimes of the United States and its running dogs and to create an excuse for the United States to carry out extremely dangerous new military adventures against Laos.
    The statement revealed that in recent months, the U.S. imperialists and their gang, in order to salvage their increasingly disastrous defeats in Laos and South Vietnam, have been deliberately expanding the war of aggression against Laos and Indochina.
    The statement said, "It is clear that it is none other than the U.S. aggressors and their gang who have created and are creating the current serious situation in Laos. In order to cover up their crimes, the United States and its followers are shifting the blame onto the Lao Patriotic Front, creating an excuse to realize their long-planned conspiracy to send U.S. ground forces to directly participate in the war in Laos."
    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, February 26th (via telephone) -- Pathet Lao Radio published a commentary on February 24th, strongly condemning the Thai reactionary authorities for increasingly following U.S. imperialism in participating in the war of aggression against Laos and for its recent crime of dispatching troops to attack the Phou Kout Mountain area in Xieng Khouang Province, Laos.
    The commentary said that the Thai reactionary authorities have dispatched troops to serve U.S. aggression against Laos more than once. Recently, the United States is expanding the war of aggression to the entire Indochina and is preparing to send its troops to directly occupy central and lower Laos. While helping its American master to intensify the expansion of military facilities in Thailand and allowing more American troops to enter Thailand, the Thai reactionary authorities are also intensifying the concentration of their own troops in areas close to the Lao border, and constantly slandering the Lao Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. At the same time, the Thai reactionary authorities are constantly carrying out armed provocations against the Kingdom of Cambodia, creating excuses for its American master to expand the war of aggression.
    The commentary pointed out that the Thai reactionary authorities' increasing following of the United States in participating in the aggression against Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and its willingness to turn Thailand into a base for U.S. aggression against Indochina are extremely dangerous acts. The commentary sternly warned U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionary authorities that they must rein themselves in in time, otherwise, the Thai people and all the people of Indochina will never forgive them.

　　巴特寮电台驳斥万象当局捏造谣言并强烈谴责泰国当局充当美国侵略老挝帮凶
    新华社康开二十六日电  据巴特寮电台二十六日广播，守卫在富科特山的老挝爱国武装力量从二月四日到十七日反击敌人的战斗中，共计歼灭敌人三百五十二名，击落美国飞机七架，缴获大炮六门、各种轻重机枪和步枪六十多件、以及大批弹药和军用物资。
    据新华社康开二十五日电  据巴特寮电台广播，老挝琅勃拉邦省爱国军民在十六日和十七日收复了今年二月初被美帝国主义及其走狗军队占领的巴森县的南特、班和坎、南赛寮、班巴开等地区。
    爱国军民在收复这些地区的战斗中，歼灭敌人一百二十二名，缴获大炮两门、各种枪七十多支以及大批军用物资。
    这家电台还广播，老挝爱国军民十九日收复了川圹和桑怒两省交界的塔拉、纳康地区。爱国军民在同盘踞在这个地区的反动武装作战中，打死敌人四十多名，俘虏二十七名，并且缴获了许多武器和军用物资。
    据新华社康开二十六日电  巴特寮电台二十六日受权发表声明，驳斥万象政权捏造的所谓“有两万多名北越军队进入老挝”的谣言。
    声明指出，这完全是毫无根据的和恬不知耻的捏造，企图借此掩盖美国及其走狗的罪行，并为美国实现对老挝的极端危险的新的军事冒险制造借口。
    声明揭露说，最近几个月以来，美帝国主义及其走狗集团为了挽救它们在老挝和越南南方的日益惨重的失败，已经和正在蓄意扩大对老挝和印度支那的侵略战争。
    声明说，“很明显，已经和正在给老挝带来目前严重局势的不是别人，正是美国侵略者及其走狗集团。美国及其追随者为了掩盖罪行，把责任推到老挝爱国战线党身上，为实现它们早已策划的派遣美国陆军到老挝直接参战的阴谋制造借口。”
    据新华社康开二十六日电  巴特寮电台二十四日发表评论，强烈谴责泰国反动当局日益追随美帝国主义参与侵略老挝的战争以及它最近派遣军队进攻老挝川圹省富科特山地区的罪行。
    评论说，泰国反动当局曾不只一次地派遣军队为美国侵略老挝卖命。最近，美国正在把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那，并准备派遣它的军队直接侵占老挝中寮和下寮地区。泰国反动当局在帮助它的美国主子加紧在泰国扩建军事设施，并让更多的美国军队进入泰国的同时，也加紧把它自己的军队集中到靠近老挝的边境地区，并且不断地诬蔑老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国。同时，泰国反动当局还不断对柬埔寨王国进行武装挑衅，为它的美国主子扩大侵略战争制造借口。
    评论指出，泰国反动当局日益追随美国参与对越南、老挝和柬埔寨的侵略和它甘心把泰国变成美国侵略印度支那的基地的行为是极其危险的。评论严厉警告美帝国主义和泰国反动当局必须及时悬崖勒马，否则，泰国人民、全体印度支那人民决不会饶恕它们。
