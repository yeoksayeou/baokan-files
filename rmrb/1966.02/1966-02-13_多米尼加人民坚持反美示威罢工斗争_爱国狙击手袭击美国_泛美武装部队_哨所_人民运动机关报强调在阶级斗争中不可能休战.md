    Xinhua News Agency, February 12th, Santo Domingo Dispatch: The heroic and unyielding Dominican people have, for the third consecutive day on the 11th, held fierce anti-American demonstrations and a nationwide general strike, protesting the bloody suppression by U.S. invading forces and reactionary military police, and demanding that the puppet authorities immediately expel Camineiro, the pro-American right-wing military leader, from the Dominican Republic.

    Reports say that the general strike has paralyzed the Dominican Republic. On the 11th, most factories in the capital, Santo Domingo, went on strike, causing all eleven sugar mills of the Dominican State Sugar Corporation to cease operations. At the same time, government agencies and many shops in the capital and other regions were also closed. For the past three days, Santo Domingo has been filled with an atmosphere of intense combat, with constant gunfire and bomb explosions throughout the city.

    Dominican patriotic snipers, fearless and courageous in their struggle, attacked outposts of the U.S.-controlled "Pan-American Armed Forces" on the night of the 9th. According to Western news agencies, the Dominican people have also launched anti-American and anti-tyranny struggles in four other cities.

    The tenacious struggle of the Dominican people has made the U.S. aggressors tremble with fear and uneasiness. From the afternoon of the 11th, they cut off telecommunications between the Dominican Republic and the rest of the world and blockaded the Santo Domingo airport.

    According to reports, under strong pressure from the people, the Dominican puppet authorities were forced to announce on the 11th that former Minister of the Armed Forces, Camineiro, would leave the Dominican Republic on the 12th. Prior to this, U.S. Ambassador to the "Organization of American States," Bank, had held "secret talks" with this executioner.

    In order to alleviate the irreconcilable contradictions between the Dominican people and the U.S. occupation forces and the right-wing army, the Dominican puppet government, under U.S. instructions, announced on January 6th that it would exile some right-wing military leaders, along with leaders of the rebel forces, but in reality, the right-wing military leaders have remained in the Dominican Republic.

    Despite the U.S. having carried out ten months of extremely vicious aggression and interference against the Dominican Republic, they are increasingly in a desperate situation.

    Recently, the U.S. ruling clique replaced its ambassador to the Dominican Republic and many other important diplomatic officials, as well as the American deputy commander of the "Pan-American Armed Forces," but it has not been able to ease the Dominican people's anti-American struggle. U.S. President Johnson had to admit at a press conference on the 11th that the storm of the Dominican people's anti-American struggle was "a very difficult situation" for the United States.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 12th, Santo Domingo Dispatch: The Dominican People's Movement newspaper, *Libertad*, recently published a commentary emphasizing that the Dominican people "have only one way out, and that is to resolutely carry out the struggle against U.S. imperialism and the (Dominican) oligarchical government."

    The commentary strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's instruction to the Garcia Godoy puppet government to take a series of measures to suppress the Dominican people. It said, "These measures are preparatory steps for a vast anti-national plan aimed at our country's workers, the masses of the people, and all anti-imperialist strata, with the aim of strengthening the rule of imperialism and the oligarchy over our country."

    The commentary pointed out, "While promoting this anti-people suppressive policy, imperialism and its puppets are calling on all sectors of the country to achieve a 'political truce,' that is, not to carry out the struggle against imperialism and the oligarchy."

    The commentary said, "In the face of every new anti-people, anti-national conspiracy, it is the constant duty of Dominican revolutionaries to expose the reactionaries and involve the people in the struggle." It said, "There can be no truce in class struggle."

    The commentary pointed out that as long as we adhere to an anti-imperialist united front led by the working class and its political party, using armed struggle as the main method, "imperialism and all reactionaries will inevitably be overthrown."

    多米尼加人民坚持反美示威罢工斗争
    爱国狙击手袭击美国“泛美武装部队”哨所
    人民运动机关报强调在阶级斗争中不可能休战
    新华社十二日讯　圣多明各消息：英勇不屈的多米尼加人民十一日已经连续第三天举行激烈的反美示威和全国性总罢工，抗议美国侵略军和反动军警的血腥镇压，并且要求傀儡当局立即把亲美的右派军事头目卡米内罗赶出多米尼加。
    消息说，总罢工已经使多米尼加陷于瘫痪状态。十一日，首都圣多明各的绝大部分工厂举行了罢工，罢工使多米尼加国营糖业公司的十一个糖厂全部停工。同时，首都和其他一些地区的政府机关和许多商店也都关了门。三天来，圣多明各到处充满了紧张战斗的气氛，全城不断响着枪声和炸弹爆炸声。
    不畏强暴、敢于斗争的多米尼加爱国狙击手们九日夜间曾经袭击了美国控制的“泛美武装部队”的哨所。据西方通讯社报道，多米尼加人民在另外四个城市里也掀起了反美抗暴斗争。
    多米尼加人民顽强的斗争使得美国侵略者胆战心惊、惶恐不安。他们从十一日下午起切断了多米尼加同世界其他地区的电讯联系，并且封锁了圣多明各的飞机场。
    据报道，在人民强大的压力下，多米尼加傀儡当局十一日被迫宣布：前武装部队部部长卡米内罗将在十二日离开多米尼加。在此以前，美国驻“美洲国家组织”大使班克曾经和这个刽子手进行了“密谈”。
    为了缓和多米尼加人民同美国占领军和右派军队之间不可调和的矛盾，多米尼加傀儡政府一月六日在美国授意下曾经宣布要把一些右派军事头目连同起义部队领导人一起放逐国外，而实际上右派军事头目一直赖在多米尼加不走。
    尽管美国佬对多米尼加进行了十个月穷凶极恶的侵略和干涉，但是他们越来越处于黔驴技穷的困境。
    最近，美国统治集团更换了它驻多米尼加的大使和其他许多重要的外交官员，以及“泛美武装部队”的美国籍副司令，也无法缓和多米尼加人民的反美斗争。美国总统约翰逊十一日在记者招待会上也不得不承认多米尼加人民反美斗争的风暴对美国来说，“是一个非常困难的局势”。
    新华社十二日讯　圣多明各消息：多米尼加人民运动机关报《自由报》最近发表评论强调指出：多米尼加人民“只有一条出路，这就是坚决地进行反对美帝国主义和（多米尼加）寡头政府的斗争”。
    评论强烈谴责美帝国主义指令加西亚·戈多伊傀儡政府采取一系列镇压多米尼加人民的措施。它说，“这些措施是反民族的一个庞大计划的预备步骤，这个计划的矛头指向我国劳动者、人民群众和一切反帝阶层，其目的是为了加强帝国主义和寡头势力对我国的统治”。
    评论指出，“帝国主义及其傀儡在推行这种反人民的镇压政策的同时，却号召全国各阶层实现‘政治休战’，这就是说，不要进行反对帝国主义和寡头势力的斗争”。
    评论说，“在每一个新的反人民、反民族的阴谋面前，揭露反动派，使人民投入斗争，这是多米尼加革命者的经常义务”。它说，“在阶级斗争中不可能休战”。
    评论指出，只要坚持一个由工人阶级及其政党领导、把武装斗争作为主要方法的反帝统一战线，“帝国主义和一切反动派就必将被打倒”。
