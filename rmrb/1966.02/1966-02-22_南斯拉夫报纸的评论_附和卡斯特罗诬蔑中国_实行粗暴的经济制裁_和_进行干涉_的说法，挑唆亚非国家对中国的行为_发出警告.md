    Echoes Castro's Slanderous Claims that China "Imposes Brutal Economic Sanctions" and "Interferes," Inciting Asian and African Countries to "Issue Warnings" About China's Actions
    The newspaper *Borba* published a commentary entitled "Chinese Rice" on February 8, slandering China's policy towards Cuba. The summary is as follows:
    Various signs, which have been appearing more and more frequently recently, indicate that Cuban-Chinese relations are becoming increasingly estranged and cold in a wider scope. The political conflict that erupted over China's reduction in the supply of rice to Cuba has clearly revealed the complex relationship between the two countries and shows that Cuba's claims are correct, namely that the real reason for the improper rice trade is not economic.
    Castro condemned Beijing for "imposing brutal economic sanctions purely for political reasons," and clarified the essence of the dispute with many unusually fierce words and criticisms. The essence of the dispute is quite simple: Cuba, as it is now, while taking its own path and defending this path from attacks within the hemisphere, also repels China's encroachment on its independence.
    Cuba is unwilling to further participate in the polemics within the international communist movement. However, exposing the background of this entire incident leads to the conclusion that Cuba's attitude will change.
    Castro compared the methods used by Chinese representatives in Havana to the actions of the US embassy at the time, which—as he said—"interfered in my country's internal affairs." This comparison is enough to explain why the atmosphere of Sino-Cuban relations has changed so dramatically, and also enough to explain why Beijing has suffered a series of diplomatic and political setbacks last year and why more Asian and African countries have issued warnings about the same situation Havana is now talking about—China's attempt to interfere in other countries' internal affairs.
    The weekly *Komunist* published a commentary entitled "Pressure on Cuba" on February 10. After echoing Castro's attacks on China for interfering in Cuba's internal affairs, the commentary wrote:
    These situations alone are enough to show that China's attempts to interfere and exert pressure on the Cuban government have seriously damaged Sino-Cuban relations. However, it is clear that this time, more clearly and prominently than in some previous cases, the Chinese government cannot tolerate other countries striving to maintain an independent, autonomous, and equal partner status in their relations with China.

　　南斯拉夫报纸的评论
    附和卡斯特罗诬蔑中国“实行粗暴的经济制裁”和“进行干涉”的说法，挑唆亚非国家对中国的行为“发出警告”
    《战斗报》二月八日以《中国大米》为题，发表了诬蔑中国对古巴政策的评论，摘要如下：
    近来愈益经常出现的各种迹象表明，古巴—中国关系正在一个更加广泛的范围内疏远和冷淡下来。围绕着中国减少供给古巴大米而爆发的政治冲突，一下子十分清楚地揭示了两国间的复杂关系，并表明古巴方面的说法是正确的，即大米的不正当交易的真正原因并非经济性的。
    卡斯特罗谴责北京“纯粹出于政治原因而实行粗暴的经济制裁”，并以许多异常激烈的辞句和批评阐明了争端的实质。争端的实质是相当简单的：现在这样的古巴在走自己的道路时，在捍卫这条道路免受所在半球范围内的攻击时，也击退了中国对其独立的侵犯。
    古巴不愿进一步参与国际共产主义运动中的论战。但是，由于暴露了整个这一事件的背景使人得出结论：古巴的这一态度将会改变。
    卡斯特罗把中国代表在哈瓦那所使用的方法同美国大使馆当时——如他所说的——“干涉我国内政”的行为相比。这一对比也足以说明为什么中古关系的气氛发生了巨大变化，也足以说明为什么北京去年在外交上和政治上遭到一系列失败以及为什么较多的亚非国家对象哈瓦那现在所说的同样情况——中国企图干涉他国内政——发出了警告。
    《共产主义者》周报二月十日以《对古巴的压力》为题发表了一篇评论，评论在附和卡斯特罗攻击中国干涉古巴内政的说法后写道：
    这些情况本身就足以说明，中国企图进行干涉和对古巴政府施加压力，严重损害了中古关系。但是，显然，这次比以前某些情况都更清楚和更突出得多地表明，中国政府不能容忍其他国家在对华关系中努力保持独立自主的和平等的伙伴的身份。
