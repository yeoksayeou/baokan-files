    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 8th. The Cambodian newspaper *Cambodge News* published a commentary on the 7th, condemning the barbaric act of Indonesian right-wing forces attacking the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Jakarta.
    The commentary pointed out: Indonesian elements serving the American cause organized anti-China demonstrations and recently attacked the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Jakarta. This "is a provocation and open challenge to China and to countries that, along with China, sincerely love peace and uphold justice."
    The commentary said: Indonesian reactionaries are trying their best to undermine the good relations existing between Indonesia and China. This is because, "in the eyes of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, China is the main obstacle to realizing their dream of world hegemony." Therefore, "Indonesian reactionaries are carrying out the instructions of their foreign masters, organizing anti-China demonstrations, and constantly provoking the People's China. These elements and thugs—their natural allies—dress up as students or workers, trying to make the world believe that this is the Indonesian people expressing dissatisfaction with the People's China. However, such tricks cannot fool people. Especially because the 'demonstrators' are 'transported' by military vehicles or armored vehicles! This ugly drama is too clumsy!"
    The commentary said that within Indonesia, suppression is extremely rampant. A large number of patriots have been arrested, detained, and killed. The number of murders has reached an unimaginable level. Journalists who do not serve the military regime are persecuted like criminals. Journalists from anti-imperialist (Asian-African) countries are treated as enemies.
    The commentary expressed confidence that the Indonesian people themselves will take on the responsibility of restoring order. "Because the Indonesian people, like their brothers in other Third World countries, will never allow their country to be placed under the oppression of U.S. imperialism and in the hands of the lackeys of U.S. imperialism."

    柬报谴责印度尼西亚右派势力的反华挑衅
    印度尼西亚右派在执行美帝指示
    新华社金边八日电　《柬埔寨电讯报》七日发表评论，谴责印度尼西亚右派势力袭击中华人民共和国驻雅加达大使馆的野蛮行为。
    评论指出：为美国事业效劳的印度尼西亚分子组织反华示威，最近又袭击中华人民共和国驻雅加达大使馆，这“是对中国以及同中国一道真诚爱好和平和主持正义的国家的挑衅和公开挑战。”
    评论说：印度尼西亚反动派竭力破坏印度尼西亚同中国之间存在的良好的关系。这是因为，“在美帝国主义及其走狗看来，中国是它们实现称霸世界梦想的主要障碍。”因此“印度尼西亚反动分子执行其外国主子的指示，组织反华示威游行，不断向人民中国进行挑衅。这些分子和暴徒——这是他们自然的同盟者——装扮成学生或工人，企图使世界相信，这是印度尼西亚人民对人民中国表示不满。但是，这样的花招是骗不了人的。特别是因为‘示威者’是用军车或装甲车‘运送’的！这出丑剧演得太拙劣了！”
    评论说，在印度尼西亚国内，镇压活动极为猖狂。大批的爱国者遭到逮捕、拘禁和杀害。谋杀事件之多达到令人难以想象的程度。不为军人政权效劳的记者象犯人一样遭到迫害。反对帝国主义的（亚非）各国记者被当作敌人。
    评论表示相信，印度尼西亚人民自己必将担负起恢复秩序的责任。“因为印度尼西亚人民象第三世界其他国家的兄弟一样，决不会听任自己的国家置于美帝国主义的压迫之下和掌握在美帝国主义的走狗的手中。”
