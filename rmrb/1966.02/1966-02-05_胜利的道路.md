Title: The Road to Victory

    The fourth of February is "Angola Day." The Angolan people's armed struggle against the Portuguese colonialists has persisted for five years. They fight bravely, liberate large areas of land, and deal heavy blows to the Portuguese colonialists.
    The Angolan people can profoundly understand from their own struggle that Chairman Mao's thesis that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is completely correct. Angolan guerrillas say, "In order to seize political power, we must never lay down our arms." The Angolan people, grasping the truth and gaining their own experience, will have an invincible spiritual strength, which will form an incomparably powerful material force, enabling them to go from having no weapons to taking up weapons, from not knowing how to fight to being good at fighting, and from victory to greater victory.
    At present, the Angolan people are still facing powerful Portuguese colonialists. This group of colonialists, who will never voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history, are also backed by US imperialism. To defeat them, the Angolan people must overcome numerous difficulties and engage in long-term and arduous struggle. However, the Angolan people's struggle over the past five years has been sufficient to prove that the final victory does not belong to the seemingly powerful imperialism and colonialism, but to the seemingly weak oppressed people who dare to struggle. No matter how ferociously the Portuguese colonialists clamor to "unswervingly implement" the colonial suppression policy, it is doomed to bankruptcy.

    胜利的道路
    二月四日是“安哥拉日”。安哥拉人民反对葡萄牙殖民主义者的武装斗争，已经坚持了五年。他们英勇战斗，解放了大片土地，给了葡萄牙殖民者以沉重的打击。
    安哥拉人民从自己的战斗中能够深刻体会到：毛主席提出的“枪杆子里面出政权”的论断是完全正确的。安哥拉游击队员说：“为了夺取政权，我们决不能放下武器”。安哥拉人民掌握真理，又取得自己的经验，他们就会有不可战胜的精神力量，这个精神力量就会形成无比强大的物质力量，使他们能够从没有武器到拿起武器，从不会打仗到善于打仗，从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    现在，安哥拉人民仍然面对着强大的葡萄牙殖民主义者。这群决不会自动退出历史舞台的殖民主义者，还得到美帝国主义的撑腰。要战胜它们，安哥拉人民还要克服重重的困难，进行长期的艰苦战斗。但是，安哥拉人民五年来的斗争已经足以证明，最后的胜利并不是属于貌似强大的帝国主义和殖民主义，而是属于似乎弱小的敢于斗争的被压迫人民。不管葡萄牙殖民者怎样穷凶极恶地叫嚷要“坚定不移地贯彻”殖民镇压政策，这都是注定要破产的。
