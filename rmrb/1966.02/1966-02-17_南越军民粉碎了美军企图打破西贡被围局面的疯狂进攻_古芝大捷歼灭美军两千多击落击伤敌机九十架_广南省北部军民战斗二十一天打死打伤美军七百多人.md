    Hanoi, February 16 (Xinhua) – The South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency recently released a comprehensive battle report on the great victory in Cu Chi, Gia Dinh Province, stating that from January 8 to February 5, the army and people in the northern and southern regions of Cu Chi County, Gia Dinh Province, South Vietnam, in successive counter-attacks against the large-scale "mopping-up" operations by the U.S. aggressor troops and their puppet troops, annihilated a total of 2,627 enemies, including 2,577 U.S. aggressor troops and Australian accomplice troops killed or wounded, shot down or damaged 90 enemy aircraft, and destroyed or damaged 56 enemy M-113 amphibious armored vehicles and 27 other military vehicles.
    In the northern region of Cu Chi County, the Liberation Armed Forces, in the twelve-day battle from January 8 to 19 (see the picture above), annihilated a total of 1,644 enemies, including 1,438 U.S. aggressor troops killed and 206 U.S. and Australian accomplice troops wounded; destroyed or damaged 56 enemy M-113 amphibious armored vehicles and 21 military vehicles, and shot down or damaged 84 enemy aircraft, destroyed two 105mm cannons and nine mortars.
    In the southern region of Cu Chi County, the Liberation Armed Forces also engaged in continuous and heroic combat with the enemy for fourteen days and nights from January 23 to February 5, annihilating 983 enemies, including 933 U.S. aggressor troops killed or wounded; shot down or damaged six enemy aircraft, destroyed or damaged six military vehicles, and destroyed one 105mm cannon and one mortar.
    In the battle, the army and people in the southern region of Cu Chi County beat the U.S. aggressor troops so badly that they abandoned their helmets and armor, and corpses littered the fields. The guerrillas of various villages closely coordinated in the fighting, clinging to the enemy, pursuing them closely, and beating the U.S. aggressor troops into a state of terror. When the enemy was repeatedly beaten, the brave fighters of the Liberation Armed Forces plunged straight into the heart of the enemy, attacked the enemy's command post, and annihilated the U.S. troops with grenades and hand mines.
    (This newspaper reports) The U.S. aggressor troops who invaded the Cu Chi area in January suffered extremely heavy blows from the army and people of Cu Chi, suffering heavy casualties and being in a state of utter disarray.
    After the U.S. aggressor troops broke into the Cu Chi area on January 8, the heroic and tenacious army and people of Cu Chi immediately gave the aggressors a head-on blow from all directions, day and night.
    The army and people of Cu Chi brought into play the great power of the people's war, using elusive, resourceful, and flexible tactics to bravely and tenaciously annihilate the aggressors. They suddenly disappeared, suddenly appeared; sometimes bombarding or sniping, fiercely attacking the enemies in motion; sometimes like extremely sharp knives, directly inserting into the enemy's bases, cutting off the enemy piece by piece. In the battle, many U.S. aggressor troops either fell dead from bullets, or triggered landmines or fell into sharp stake traps and lost their lives.
    After suffering heavy blows, the U.S. aggressor troops, from January 14 to 19, frantically attempted to withdraw and flee in a panic. These U.S. aggressor troops were aggressive when they came, but were in a state of utter disarray when they retreated, exposing their ugly state. As soon as the helicopters sent to rescue them arrived, they were like a pack of stray dogs, rushing to be the first, pushing and shoving each other, rushing out of the various caves and trenches where they were hiding, scrambling to climb onto the helicopters to escape, creating a chaotic scene. Because there were not enough planes, and also because of the pursuit of the Liberation Army and guerrillas, and the artillery fire coming from all directions, the helicopter pilots, who had been frightened out of their wits, ignored the fact that a large number of U.S. aggressors had not had time to climb onto the planes and hurriedly took off, so that many helicopters had many American soldiers only half of their bodies climbed into the cabin, or even only managed to hold onto the cabin door with both hands, hanging on the plane to escape. The sky and the ground were filled with the cries of American soldiers. Many helicopters were hit before they could escape, wobbled and even crashed, shattering into pieces. The American soldiers who did not have time to board the helicopters hurriedly ran back to the caves and trenches where they had been hiding, but they also lost their lives because they could not avoid the accurate shooting of the Cu Chi army and people. Some American soldiers were so frightened that they lost their heads, and saw piles of rice straw and rushed over to try to hide, so they either triggered landmines or fell on sharp stakes. Teams of American soldiers fleeing along the highway were intercepted by the Liberation Army and guerrillas who had been waiting for a long time.
    On the roads and lands of Cu Chi, the U.S. aggressor troops, puppet troops and accomplice troops left corpses everywhere, and U.S. weapons and military supplies were thrown around everywhere.
    Hanoi, February 16 (Xinhua) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, from January 10 to 30, the army and people in the northern region of Quang Nam Province, South Vietnam, annihilated over 1,000 enemies, including over 700 U.S. aggressor troops killed or wounded, shot down or damaged 16 U.S. bandit aircraft, destroyed 16 various enemy military vehicles, and captured a large number of weapons.
    The report said that in Dai Loc and Duy Xuyen counties, the Liberation Armed Forces successively crushed the "mopping-up" operations of five battalions of U.S. aggressor troops and puppet troops from January 10 to 19, annihilating 496 enemies, including 430 U.S. aggressor troops killed or wounded, and shooting down or damaging 11 enemy aircraft.
    In Dien Ban County, the guerrillas attacked the enemy 22 times in these 20 days, annihilating a total of 240 enemies, including over 100 U.S. aggressor troops. The guerrillas also shot down a U.S. jet fighter with a rifle.
    The guerrillas in He Wang County also continuously attacked the enemy during this period, killing or wounding nearly 100 U.S. aggressor troops.
    In addition, the guerrillas in the northern region of Quang Nam Province also continuously attacked the enemy in various places, destroying many "strategic hamlets" and annihilating a batch of enemy troops. (Attached picture)

    南越军民粉碎了美军企图打破西贡被围局面的疯狂进攻
    古芝大捷歼灭美军两千多击落击伤敌机九十架
    广南省北部军民战斗二十一天打死打伤美军七百多人
    新华社河内十六日电　越南南方解放通讯社最近发表嘉定省古芝大捷的综合战报说，从一月八日至二月五日，越南南方嘉定省古芝县北部和南部军民在连续两次反击美国侵略军和它的仆从军的大规模“扫荡”战斗中，共歼灭敌人二千六百二十七名，其中打死打伤美国侵略军和澳大利亚帮凶军二千五百七十七名，击落击伤敌机九十架，击毁、击伤敌M—113两栖装甲车五十六辆和其他军车二十七辆。
    在古芝县北部地区，解放武装力量在一月八日至十九日的十二天战斗（见上图）中，共歼灭敌人一千六百四十四名，其中打死美国侵略军一千四百三十八名，打伤美军和澳大利亚帮凶军二百零六名；击毁和击伤敌M—113两栖装甲车五十六辆、军车二十一辆，击落击伤敌机八十四架，击毁一零五毫米大炮两门和迫击炮九门。
    在古芝县南部地区，解放武装力量从一月二十三日至二月五日，也同敌人展开了连续十四个昼夜的英勇战斗，共歼敌九百八十三名，其中打死打伤美国侵略军九百三十三名；击落击伤敌机六架，击毁和击伤军车六辆，炸毁一零五毫米大炮和迫击炮各一门。
    古芝县南部地区军民在战斗中把美国侵略军打得丢盔弃甲，横尸遍野。各乡游击队紧密配合战斗，咬住敌人不放，紧紧追击，打得美国侵略军丧魂落魄。当敌人接连挨揍的时候，解放武装力量的勇士们又直插敌军心脏，袭击敌军的指挥所，用手榴弹和手雷歼灭美军。
    本报讯　一月间进犯古芝地区的美国侵略军，遭到古芝军民极其沉重的打击，伤亡惨重，狼狈万状。
    美国侵略军一月八日闯到古芝地区后，英勇顽强的古芝军民立即不分昼夜地从四面八方给予侵略者以迎头痛击。
    古芝军民发挥人民战争的巨大威力，以神出鬼没、机智灵活的战术，勇敢顽强地痛歼侵略者。他们突然隐没，突然出现；时而以炮轰或狙击，揪着蠢动中的敌人狠揍；时而象一把把锋利无比的尖刀，直插敌人的驻地，一块块地把敌人分割。在战斗中使许多美国侵略军不是中弹倒毙，就是触发地雷或掉到尖桩陷阱里丧命。
    美国强盗遭到沉重打击后，从一月十四日至十九日，慌慌张张地妄图收兵逃跑。这些美国侵略军来时气势汹汹，溃逃时却狼狈万状，丑态百出。派来救援的直升飞机一到，他们就象一群丧家之犬，争先恐后，你推我撞地从他们所隐匿的各处地洞和壕沟里冲过去，抢着要爬上直升飞机逃命，乱作一团。由于飞机不够，更加上解放军和游击队追击的炮火，又从四面八方纷纷打过来，被吓破了胆的直升飞机驾驶员，不顾还有大批美国侵略者来不及爬上飞机就慌忙驾机起飞，以至许多直升飞机起飞后，还有不少美国兵只是半个身子爬进舱门，甚至只来得及两手攀着舱门，挂在飞机上逃命。天上地上，一片美国兵的哭喊声。许多直升飞机来不及逃跑就被击中，摇摇晃晃以至坠落，摔得粉碎。来不及上直升飞机的美国兵又慌忙地跑回原来藏匿的地洞和壕沟，但是他们也因躲避不了古芝军民的准确射击而丧命。有些美国兵吓得晕头转向，看见稻堆草垛就没命地冲过去企图藏躲，因而不是触发了地雷，就是掉在尖桩上。沿着公路逃跑的一队队美国兵，更是遭到等待已久的解放军和游击队的截击。
    在古芝的公路和土地上，美国侵略军、伪军和仆从军遗尸遍野，美国武器和军需品到处乱扔。
    新华社河内十六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广南省北部军民从一月十日到三十日，共歼灭敌人一千多名，其中打死、打伤美国侵略军七百多名，击落、击伤美国强盗飞机十六架，击毁敌人各种军车十六辆和缴获大批武器。
    报道说，在大禄、维川两县，解放武装力量从一月十日到十九日接连粉碎了五个营美国侵略军和伪军的“扫荡”，歼灭敌人四百九十六名，其中打死打伤美国侵略军四百三十名，击落、击伤敌机十一架。
    在奠盘县，游击队在这二十天中出击敌人二十二次，共歼敌二百四十名，其中包括美国侵略军一百多名，游击队还用步枪击落美国喷气式战斗机一架。
    和旺县游击队在这期间也不断出击敌人，打死打伤美国侵略军近百名。
    此外，广南省北部游击队还在各地接连袭击敌人，捣毁许多“战略村”，并歼灭一批敌军。（附图片）
