    According to materials exposed by newspapers here, U.S. imperialism is using despicable means in Hong Kong to lure seamen to transport military supplies to South Vietnam to serve its war of aggression against Vietnam.

    Newspaper reports say that U.S. imperialism has received cooperation from Japan and Britain in luring seamen to South Vietnam in Hong Kong.

    According to reports in the Hong Kong newspapers *Wen Wei Po* and *Ta Kung Pao* on the 11th, U.S. imperialism, on January 20th, used a "shipping company" here to "recruit" a group of Hong Kong seamen with high salaries. This "shipping company" concealed the name of the ship, route, and destination from the recruited seamen and, using the excuse of urgency, did not sign contracts with the recruited seamen in Hong Kong. It quickly transported them to Kobe, Japan, by plane. Before these seamen boarded the ship in Kobe, the "shipping company" called them to the British Consulate in Kobe to sign contracts. The contracts stated that the tugboat "Soun Maru," of approximately one hundred tons, where the seamen were to work, was heading to South Vietnam and would be directly under the control of the U.S. Navy. The report said that the ship was painted in the gray color of military vessels, flew the Japanese flag, and was owned by South Koreans. After learning the truth, some of the recruited seamen, unwilling to act as accomplices for U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, refused to sign the contracts. These seamen are currently still in Japan.

    The *Wen Wei Po* and *Ta Kung Pao* also exposed some other despicable methods used by U.S. imperialism in "recruiting" seamen in Hong Kong. For example, when some seamen were deceived into being recruited, the "shipping company" controlled by U.S. imperialism immediately put them on board. The "manager" of the "shipping company" personally boarded the ship to supervise, and only left the ship and landed after it had left Hong Kong.

    According to reports in these two newspapers on the 9th, following the recent refusal of more than thirty Hong Kong Chinese seamen to transport military supplies to South Vietnam for U.S. imperialism, another twenty-one Hong Kong Chinese seamen refused to transport military supplies to South Vietnam for U.S. imperialism. The report said that the Norwegian cargo ship "Sri Dhevi Larat," belonging to the Hong Kong "Tang Mei Shipping Company," which operated on the Indonesian route, announced that it was going to South Vietnam after arriving in Hong Kong on the 8th. All the Chinese seamen on board unanimously refused and collectively resigned from the ship on the 10th. They solemnly stated their firm support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and their refusal to be tools of U.S. imperialism's aggression.

    美帝勾结英日诱骗香港海员去南越
    香港中国海员了解真相后拒绝为美帝运侵越物资
    据新华社香港十二日电　据这里报纸揭露的材料，美帝国主义正在香港以卑劣手段诱骗海员运送军用物资去南越为它的侵越战争服务。
    报纸的报道说，美帝国主义在香港诱骗海员去南越的时候，得到了日本和英国的合作。
    据香港《文汇报》和《大公报》十一日报道，美帝国主义在一月二十日通过这里的一家“船公司”，用高薪“招请”了一批香港海员。这家“船公司”向应招的海员隐瞒了船名、航线和目的地，并借口时间紧迫，不和应招海员在香港签订合同，就迅速用飞机把他们载到日本神户。这些海员在神户上船前，“船公司”把他们叫到英国驻神户领事馆去签订合同，合同上竟然写明，海员们要去工作的那艘约一百吨的拖轮“早云丸”，是开往南越并由美国海军直接管辖的。报道说，这艘船漆着军用船只的灰颜色，悬挂着日本国旗，由南朝鲜人当船主。一些应招海员了解事情真相后，不愿为美帝国主义充当侵略越南的帮凶，拒绝在合同上签字，目前这些海员还留在日本。
    香港《文汇报》和《大公报》还揭露了美帝国主义在香港“招请”海员时的一些其他恶劣手段。例如一些海员受骗应招时，受美帝国主义支配的“船公司”立即把他们弄到船上，“船公司”的“经理”亲自上船监视，待船驶离香港时，“经理”才只身离船登岸。
    据这两家报纸九日报道，继最近三十多名香港中国海员拒绝为美帝国主义运送军用物资去南越后，又有二十一名香港中国海员拒绝为美帝国主义运输军用物资去南越。报道说，一艘行走印度尼西亚航线、属于香港“唐美轮船公司”的“斯利德里·拉腊特”号挪威货轮，八日抵达香港后宣布要去南越时，船上的全体中国海员一致表示拒绝，并在十日集体辞职离船。他们庄严表示坚决支持越南人民的正义斗争，不做美帝国主义的侵略工具。
