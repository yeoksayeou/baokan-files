    Resolutely Struggle Against Selfish and Miscellaneous Thoughts
    Wang Daoming, Squad Leader of a Unit of the Shenyang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army
    After studying articles such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," everyone is vying to learn from good people and do good deeds. However, some comrades have not fundamentally improved their consciousness, and have not truly understood why they should do good deeds. One day, a new recruit made a suggestion: Tomorrow is Sunday, let's organize a group of people to wipe the light bulbs in the auditorium of the regimental headquarters. It turned out that he thought this way: if the regimental leaders ask who cleaned the light bulbs so clean, and everyone says it was the Eighth Squad, how glorious that would be! This shows that some comrades have done many good things, but not consciously, but with selfish motives, like doing business, wanting some benefit for doing a good deed. If you do good things this way, the more you do, the heavier your selfishness becomes. If a person often dwells on selfish thoughts, wouldn't they eventually become an egoist over time! At that time, we proposed: when studying "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," we must resolutely struggle against selfish and miscellaneous thoughts and work hard on ideological transformation.
    To struggle against selfish and miscellaneous thoughts, we must start with small things, but we must have a broad perspective and not just deal with things on a case-by-case basis, grasping every little thing. Otherwise, as Chairman Mao said, it will turn everyone into meticulous gentlemen, forgetting the Party's political tasks. We must find the great principles from those small things, and then use the great principle of everything for the revolution to control the small principles. We look at the roots from small things; the things are small, but the roots are large, and should be grasped; we look at the future from the present; the present is small, but the development is large, and should be grasped; we look at the essence from the surface; the surface looks small, but the essence is individualism, and should be grasped. To use an analogy, we must distinguish between "kohlrabi" and "large-head garlic." Kohlrabi, you see a big lump at a glance, quite glaring, but when you pull it out, the root is very small. Don't grasp so many things like that. There was a new recruit, young and playful. One day at noon, he was sitting on the windowsill and saw it was lively in the Second Platoon, so he jumped out of the window barefoot and ran to see. Some comrades criticized him: You, you have shoes but don't wear them, you have a door but don't use it, do you still want discipline! In fact, this new recruit just came to the army and didn't understand much. Just tell him to pay attention to these things in the future. However, some things are like large-head garlic, it looks very small on the surface, but when you pull it out, its root is very deep. Such living thoughts must be grasped firmly. One day at noon, an old soldier and I carried the meal back from the kitchen. When he saw there was some fried rice with oil, he took all the bowls of the squad and filled them one by one. I was surprised because this old soldier usually showed little selfishness. I asked him why he was doing this today. He said, I am doing it for the whole squad. I said, didn't Chairman Mao teach us that only caring about local small groupism is enlarged individualism! After saying this, he poured all ten bowls of fried rice with oil back. In the afternoon, we studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again. Everyone said that if we only cared about small collectives like this, Bethune would not have come to China. The Party requires us not only to be domestic revolutionaries, but also to be international revolutionaries. We must not only be selfless towards the comrades in the squad, but also be selfless towards the comrades in the platoon and company, and towards the people of the whole country and the world.
    Following Chairman Mao's teachings, establishing the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, selfish thoughts are reduced, and the style is higher. When encountering things, we can put the collective first and the individual last. Once, when putting out a mountain fire, everyone's spirit of class friendship was very good. Half a packet of Rendan was taken out for everyone to eat; half a pot of water was also given to everyone to drink; the task was heavy, and very tiring, so the comrades in the squad used their rest time to carry water for the whole company. One day of marching, it rained, and the cotton-padded coats and trousers were soaked. We lived in a house with the Second Squad, and there was only half a heated kang. Everyone said, we should give it to the Second Squad. The Second Squad insisted that we live there. I said to the Second Squad Leader, we are in better health, you should live there. Everyone pushed and yielded to each other. In the end, we had to send a new recruit as a representative to live on the heated kang with the Second Squad. We all stood guard the whole night wearing soaking wet cotton clothes. The new recruit who was the representative got up after sleeping for half an hour and quietly dried the cotton-padded coats and trousers of the Second Squad comrades.
    We have realized that only by completely and thoroughly digging out selfish and miscellaneous thoughts can we completely and thoroughly serve the people; selfishness can arise unconsciously, but it cannot be allowed to run away unconsciously. It must be transformed little by little. Some comrades say: "Selfishness is a blood-sucking worm, if selfishness increases by one point, revolutionary blood decreases by one point." We feel that selfishness not only affects unity, but more importantly affects fighting. Our army is going to fight. If we have selfishness, we cannot be fearless like Dong Cunrui and Huang Jiguang on the battlefield. Therefore, we propose: the process of overcoming selfishness is the process of cultivating a brave spirit. Less selfishness, more courage. Reduce selfishness by one point, and courage will increase by one point. If there is no selfishness, we dare to rush through mountains of knives and seas of fire!

    狠狠和私心杂念作斗争
    解放军沈阳部队某部班长　王道明
    我们学习了《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》等文章，大家争着学好人好事、做好人好事。但是，有的同志还没有从根本上提高觉悟，还没有真正懂得为什么要做好人好事。有一天，一个新战士提了一个建议：明天是星期天，咱们组织一伙人，把团部大礼堂的灯泡擦擦。原来他是这样想的：团首长若问，灯泡这么干净是谁擦的？都说是八班擦的，多光彩呀！这说明：有的同志做了很多好事，但不是自觉去做，而是带着私心去做，象做买卖一样，做一件好事想得一点好处。这样去做好事，越做私心越重。一个人要是常常在私心上作文章，天长日久，不就变成个利己主义者了吗！当时，我们就提出：学习《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》，就要狠狠地和私心杂念作斗争，在思想改造上狠下功夫。
    和私心杂念作斗争，要从小处着手，但是要从大处着眼，不能就事论事，什么小事都抓。不然，就象毛主席讲的，会把大家变成谨小慎微的君子，忘记党的政治任务。我们要从那些小事当中找出大道理，然后用一切为了革命这个大道理，来管住小道理。我们从小事看根子，事情很小，根子很大，应该抓；从眼前看将来，眼前很小，发展起来很大，应该抓；从表面看实质，表面看很小，实质是个人主义，应该抓。打个比方说，要分清“大头菜”还是“大头蒜”。大头菜，一眼就看到很大的疙瘩，挺刺眼，但是你把它拔出来，根子却很小。象这样的事，不要抓那么多。有个新战士，年龄小，贪玩。有一天中午，他在窗台上坐着，看到二排那里很热闹，他就光着脚，从窗户里跳出来，跑去看。有的同志批评他：你这个人，有鞋不穿鞋，有门不走门，你还要不要作风了！其实，这个新战士刚来部队，不大懂事，只要告诉他以后注意这些事就行了。但是，有些事象大头蒜，表面上看起来它很小，拔出来一看，它的根很深。这样的活思想就要狠抓。有一天中午，我和一个老战士到伙房把饭抬回来。他一看，有一部分油炒饭，就把全班的碗拿来，盛了一碗又一碗。我感到奇怪，这个老战士平时表现很少私心。我问他为什么今天这样做呢？他说，我是为了全班。我说，毛主席不是教导我们，只顾局部的小团体主义，就是放大了的个人主义吗！这样一讲，他把十碗油炒饭统统倒回去啦。下午，我们又学习了《纪念白求恩》。大家说要象我们这样只顾小集体，白求恩就不会到中国来啦。党要求我们不但做一个国内的革命派，而且要做一个国际的革命派，我们不但对班里的同志要没有私心，对排里、连里的同志，对全国和全世界人民也都要没有私心。
    我们按照毛主席的教导，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，私心杂念少了，风格也就高了。遇到事情，都能把集体放在前面，把个人放在后面。有一次扑灭山火的时候，大家的阶级友爱精神非常好。有半包仁丹，拿出来给大家吃；有半壶水，也给大家喝；任务重，很疲劳，班里同志就利用休息时间，给全连背水。有一天行军，赶上下雨，棉袄棉裤都淋透了，我们和二班住在一个房子，只有半铺火炕。大家说，我们要让给二班住。二班坚决让我们住。我对二班长说，我们身体比较好，还是你们住吧。大家互相推让，最后我们只好派一个新战士作代表，同二班一起住在火炕上。我们大家穿着湿透了的棉衣，整整站了一个夜晚的哨。那个当代表的新战士睡了半小时也爬起来了，悄悄地把二班同志的棉袄棉裤都给烤干。
    我们体会到，只有完全彻底挖掉私心杂念，才能完全彻底为人民服务；私心可以不知不觉地产生，但是不能不知不觉地跑掉。必须一点一滴地改造。有的同志讲：“私心是吸血虫，私心增一分，革命血液就少一分。”我们感到私心不仅影响团结，更重要的是影响打仗。我们军队要打仗，如果有了私心，到战场上就不能象董存瑞、黄继光那样不怕死。所以我们提出：克服私心的过程就是培养勇敢精神的过程。私心少了，勇敢就多了。私心减一分，勇敢就会增一分。如果私心没有了，刀山火海都敢冲！
