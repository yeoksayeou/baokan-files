　　Johnson Defends the Vietnam War, Attempts to Quell Internal Disputes
    U.S. Expands Aggression in Vietnam, Trying to Cover Up the Truth
    Xinhua News Agency, February 24th, New York Dispatch: U.S. President Johnson delivered a speech at a gathering in New York on the 23rd, strenuously defending the U.S. policy of aggression in Vietnam, which is being strongly condemned at home and abroad.

    In his speech, Johnson used nearly a third of the text to vigorously tout the U.S. imperialists' "tradition" of defending "freedom" at home and abroad; he dragged out Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and others to defend his war of aggression in Vietnam, attempting to use this method to block criticisms from all sorts of people within the U.S. ruling clique.

    Clearly addressing the recent debate and quarrel within the U.S. ruling group over the Vietnam policy, Johnson self-deprecatingly said in his speech, "Recently, some people have raised questions about what we are doing in Vietnam... Conducting open discussions in moments of crisis is our best, or rather, our most powerful tradition." He clamored, "Let no enemy anywhere regard our arguments as indecision or our debates as a sign of weakness."

    Johnson then summarized the various criticisms raised in the domestic debate in the United States into ten questions, answering and sophistically defending each one. He tried hard to portray the U.S. aggression in Vietnam as not a "war with unlimited goals"; he said that the United States would not "blindly expand its military force" to the extent of "going straight into a major war," and that the United States "must continue to use force with restraint," and that "there will be no mindless escalation now or in the future," and so on.

    Regarding the issue that the vast majority of the American public is most worried and afraid of, that is, the U.S.'s continuous escalation will lead to war with China, Johnson tried to downplay the risks brought about by the U.S.'s crazy pursuit of aggression and war policies in Asia, its hostility towards China, and its continuous expansion of the war of aggression in Vietnam, saying that "judging from our actions," the United States will not "fight against the massive communist Chinese ground forces." He also said, "We have assessed the strengths and weaknesses of others, and we also know our own strengths and weaknesses. We pay attention to maintaining caution and restraint in our actions. We also approve of others taking cautious action, and we can tolerate angry language as long as it is also cautious in action."

    However, he did not conceal that the United States will continue to strengthen the war of aggression in Vietnam. He said, "Our huge military machine has transported 200,000 people to a place ten thousand miles away since last spring. These people can now and in the future get everything they need to fight the aggressors." He also emphasized that if Westmoreland, the head of the U.S. military in Vietnam, asks to send more U.S. troops to South Vietnam for reinforcement, "his needs will be considered immediately, and, just as I promised last July, his needs will be met."

    Johnson indicated that the United States will continue to play with the bankrupt "peace" conspiracy, and the U.S.'s "relentless efforts in this regard will continue." He also hypocritically stated that the United States will "support self-determination," "support free elections," and open up a "second war—a war on poverty" in South Vietnam in order to consolidate the fascist rule of the South Vietnamese puppet regime supported by U.S. bayonets.

    In his speech, Johnson admitted that the U.S. situation in the war of aggression in Vietnam is "confused and difficult." He said he could not answer the question of "how long we will have to bear this burden." He said, "The struggle may be long-term... No computer can tell when peace will be achieved." He asked the American people at home to "know and accept this harsh reality."

　　约翰逊为侵越战争辩解力图平息内部争吵
    美国扩大侵越战争欲盖弥彰
    新华社二十四日讯　纽约消息：美国总统约翰逊二十三日在纽约的一次集会上发表演说，竭力为正遭到国内外强烈责难的美国侵越政策进行辩解。
    约翰逊在演讲中用了将近三分之一的篇幅大肆吹嘘美帝国主义者在国内外保卫“自由”的“传统”；把罗斯福、杜鲁门、艾森豪威尔、肯尼迪等都拉出来为他的侵越战争辩护，企图用这种办法来堵塞美国统治集团内形形色色的人对他的批评。
    显然是针对美国统治集团最近围绕侵越政策所爆发的大辩论和大争吵，约翰逊在演讲中自我解嘲地说，“近来，有人对我们在越南的所作所为提出了问题，……在危急的时刻进行公开讨论，这是我们最好的或者说最有力的传统。”他叫嚷说，“任何地方的敌人不要把我们的争论看作是优柔寡断，或者把我们的辩论看作是软弱的表现”。
    约翰逊接着把美国国内在大辩论中提出的各种批评，归纳为十个问题，一一作答，进行狡辩。他极力表白美国的侵越战争不是一场“目标无限的战争”；说什么美国不会“盲目扩大武力”以致“径直地进入一次大战”，美国“必须继续有分寸地使用武力”，“现在和将来都不会有不动脑子的逐步升级”等等。
    对于美国广大公众最担心、最害怕的一个问题，即美国不断升级将导致同中国打仗的问题，约翰逊力图缩小美国在亚洲疯狂推行侵略和战争政策、敌视中国以及不断扩大侵越战争所带来的风险，说什么“从我们的行动来说”，美国不会“同庞大的共产党中国地面部队作战”。他还说，“我们估量了别人的力量和弱点，我们也知道自己的力量和弱点。我们注意使自己在行动中持小心克制态度。我们也赞同别人在行动中持克制态度，我们可以忍受愤怒的语言，只要它同时在行动上是小心谨慎的。”
    但是，他不掩饰美国将继续强化侵越战争。他说，“我们庞大的军事机器从去年春天以来已经把二十万人运到一万英里之遥的地方。这些人现在和将来都可以得到他们为了同侵略者作战而需要的一切”。他还强调，如果侵越美军头子威斯特摩兰要求派更多美国兵去南越增援，“他的需要将马上得到考虑，而且，正象我在去年七月答应过的，他的需要将获得满足”。
    约翰逊表示，美国将继续玩弄早已破了产的“和平”阴谋，美国在这方面的“决不气馁的努力将继续进行”。他还伪善地表示美国将“支持自决”、“支持自由选举”，并在南越开辟“第二场战争——对贫困的战争”，以便巩固美国用刺刀支持的南越傀儡政权的法西斯统治。
    约翰逊在演讲中承认，美国在侵越战争中的处境是“混乱的、艰难的”。他表示无法回答关于“我们承担这种负担还要承担多久”的问题。他说，“斗争可能是长期的。……没有任何计算机能够说出何日何时实现和平”。他要求美国国内人民“知道并且接受这个严酷的事实”。
