　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 21st - French President Charles de Gaulle reiterated at a press conference on February 21st the need to revise the North Atlantic Treaty to enable France to recover its sovereignty from the U.S.-controlled North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and to avoid being dragged into war by the United States against its own will.

　　De Gaulle spoke at his semi-annual press conference at the Élysée Palace. He discussed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Vietnam issue, and relations among Western European countries.

　　Regarding the North Atlantic Treaty, de Gaulle said: "Nothing can make a treaty remain fully effective when its purpose has changed. Nothing can make an alliance remain the same when conditions have changed. In this case, the treaty and the alliance must be adapted to the new situation. If this is not done, the articles will become a dead letter... will become waste paper in the archives."

　　De Gaulle then criticized the current structure of the North Atlantic military alliance as no longer suitable for the new situation. He said, "Due to the internal and external evolution of the Eastern countries (referring to the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries), the fact is that the West is no longer threatened by the threat it faced in the past when the United States used the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as an excuse to establish a protective position in Europe. The danger to the West has diminished greatly, both in the past and now." He expressed doubt that, after losing its atomic monopoly, the United States would risk nuclear retaliation to use nuclear weapons to "protect" Western Europe. He said that, for France, the reason for achieving North Atlantic "integration" had thus been lost.

　　De Gaulle further elaborated on his reasons for reorganizing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He said that, although "the possibility of a world war breaking out over European issues is diminishing to some extent, the United States is becoming involved in other parts of the world, such as in Korea the day before yesterday, in Cuba yesterday, and in Vietnam today, according to the famous escalation, these conflicts may expand." De Gaulle worried that in the event of expanded conflicts, "Europe (whose strategy within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the strategy of the United States) may automatically be drawn into this comprehensive conflict, into the struggle, even though it is unwilling to do so." He said: "If France's territory, its transportation, certain troops, several air bases, and some of its ports continue to be under the U.S. command system, then France's situation may be like this."

　　De Gaulle reiterated "France's determination to be independent." He said: "This determination of France is incompatible with a defense organization in which it is in a subordinate position." He stated that France would continue to revise the arrangements currently in effect relating to France from now until April 4, 1969, when the North Atlantic Treaty expires, with the aim of "restoring a normal state of sovereignty, so that everything involving French territory, airspace, and territorial waters, matters involving forces, and any foreign troops stationed in France, shall be under the jurisdiction of the French authorities." He emphasized that, having become an atomic power by its own means, France must assume its own "political and strategic responsibilities."

　　When talking about the situation in Vietnam, De Gaulle expressed disapproval of the U.S. policy without naming it, while advocating his proposal for "the five great powers to make contact first," and said, "The French side has already organized its foreign relations in this direction." He also said, "The condition for peace is to end all foreign interference and then neutralize that country. France, having learned from experience in the past, agreed to this and withdrew its own troops. It feels particularly good about this today."

　　Speaking of relations between Western European countries, De Gaulle expressed his agreement to convene a meeting of the six "Common Market" countries to discuss the establishment of a European political alliance. He said, "If one of the countries that is building a European political community with us believes... that it should take the initiative to propose a six-nation political conference, France will respond actively and sincerely."

　　At the same time, De Gaulle reiterated his proposal for what kind of "small Europe" should be built. He said: "Once the six-nation alliance is realized, especially if it is perfected by the participation of other European countries, this six-nation alliance can and should become a valuable collaborator for the United States in all aspects. To say that it is valuable means that it is both strong and independent."

　　戴高乐重申要修改北大西洋公约收回法国主权
　　法国决心保持自主不被美国拖入战争
　　在越南问题上不赞成美国政策，但鼓吹由五大国进行接触
    新华社巴黎二十一日电　法国总统戴高乐二十一日在记者招待会上重申要修改北大西洋公约，使法国能够从美国控制下的北大西洋公约组织中收回它的主权，并且避免在违反它自己的意愿的情况下被美国拖入战争。
    戴高乐是在爱丽舍宫举行他半年一次的记者招待会的。他谈到了北大西洋公约组织、越南问题以及西欧国家之间的关系等。
    关于北大西洋公约，戴高乐说：“没有任何东西可以使得一个条约在它的目的已经改变了的时候仍然完全有效。没有任何东西可以使得一个联盟在条件发生了变化的时候仍然保持原样。在这种情况下，必须使条约和联盟适应新的情况。如果不这样做，条文将成为一纸空文……将成为档案中的废纸。”
    戴高乐接着批评了目前北大西洋军事联盟的结构已经不适合新的情况。他说，“由于东方国家（按指苏联和东欧社会主义国家）的内部和外部的演变，事实是，西方目前不再受过去在美国以北大西洋公约组织为借口在欧洲建立保护地位时所受到的威胁，对西方的危险过去和现在都远远地消失了。”他表示怀疑，在美国失去了原子垄断以后，它是否会冒本国遭到核报复的危险使用核武器来“保护”西欧。他说，这样，对法国来说，实现北大西洋“一体化”的理由就失去了。
    戴高乐接着进一步阐述他改组北大西洋公约组织的理由。他说，尽管“在欧洲问题上爆发世界大战的可能性在某种程度上正在消失，而美国在世界其他地方，如前天在朝鲜、昨天在古巴、今天在越南正在卷入（冲突），根据著名的逐步升级，这些冲突可能扩大”。戴高乐担心在冲突扩大的情况下，“欧洲（它的战略在北大西洋公约组织内就是美国的战略）可能自动地被卷入这场全面冲突中去，卷入斗争中，尽管它不愿意这样做。”他说：“如果法国的领土、它的交通、某些军队、几个空军基地和它的某些港口继续处在美国指挥体系中，那么，法国的情况就可能是这样的。”
    戴高乐重申“法国决心自主”。他说：“法国的这一决心同它在其中处于从属地位的一个防务组织是不相容的。”他表示，法国要从现在起到一九六九年四月四日北大西洋公约期满时为止，继续修改目前实行的与法国有关的安排，其目的在于“恢复正常的主权状态，让一切涉及法国领土、领空和领海，涉及力量的事情以及驻扎在法国的任何外国部队，都只能归法国当局管辖”。他强调，法国由于用自己的手段成为一个原子大国，它必须承担它自己的“政治和战略责任”。
    在谈到越南局势的时候，戴高乐未指名地表示不赞成美国的政策，同时鼓吹他的由“五大国先进行接触”的主张，并且说，“法国方面已经本着这一方向组织了它的对外关系”。他还说，“和平的条件是结束一切外国干涉，随后使那个国家中立化。法国过去得到经验后同意了这一点，撤出了自己的军队。它在今天对此感到特别好过。”
    谈到西欧国家之间的关系，戴高乐表示同意召开“共同市场”六国会议讨论建立欧洲政治联盟问题。他说，“如果正同我们一起建立欧洲政治共同体的国家之一认为……应该由它主动提议开一个六国政治会议，法国就会积极地、真诚地作出答复。”
    同时，戴高乐又重申了他关于建立一个什么样的“小欧洲”的主张。他说：“六国联盟一旦实现，特别是如果由于其他欧洲国家的参加而日臻完善的话，这个六国联盟对美国来说，就能够也应该在各方面都成为一个有价值的合作者，说它有价值就是说他既强大、又独立。”
