    "Do as Chairman Mao says, and it will be effective in every situation."
    Yang Fuzhen, winding worker at Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 1
    Comrade Yang Fuzhen, under the education and cultivation of the Party, wholeheartedly devoted herself to revolution, growing from an ordinary worker into an advanced proletarian fighter, making extraordinary achievements in her ordinary work. Since 1953, she has overfulfilled the state plan every month for thirteen consecutive years, with more than eighty months without producing any defective cloth. For more than ten years, she has maintained the glorious titles of advanced producer and Five-Good worker.
    Why is Comrade Yang Fuzhen able to do this? This article tells us: The most fundamental point is that, with deep class feelings, she reads Chairman Mao's books, listens to Chairman Mao's words, and acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions. As she said, Chairman Mao's words are written for the working people, every sentence is revolutionary truth; do as Chairman Mao says, and it will be effective in every situation.
    In the old society, I did not go to school for even one day, and I only got rid of my illiteracy after liberation. Chairman Mao's teachings were initially heard from leading comrades. I listened and remembered a little, remembered and did a little. From 1959, I started studying Chairman Mao's works. I learned and did at the same time. The more I learned, the more I did, the more I felt that Chairman Mao's words were written for us working people, every sentence is revolutionary truth, doing as Chairman Mao says will be effective in every situation, accurate every time.

    “Chairman Mao’s words are imprinted on my heart like printing blocks”
    I joined the Party in the spring of 1949. Not long after I joined the Party, Shanghai was liberated. At that time, I thought: revolution, revolution, is to revolt against the Kuomintang reactionaries, now that the Kuomintang has been overthrown, what revolution is needed? At this time, the Party Branch Secretary told me a paragraph of Chairman Mao's words: "To win country-wide victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li… The revolution in China is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work greater, and the hardship more." Chairman Mao's words were imprinted on my heart like printing blocks. I said to myself: Fuzhen, Fuzhen, the revolution has only just begun, the road ahead is longer, and the burden is heavier. Now that the Party has assigned me to weave cloth, weaving good cloth is the task the Party has given me, and the loom is my battle station.
    Later, through the Party's continuous education, I understood that we weave cloth for 650 million people, weaving cloth for the sake of the revolution. The burden of clothing a quarter of the world's population falls on the shoulders of us workers. Some of the cloth we weave is for export, to be taken to the international market to compete with goods from capitalist countries, with goods from American imperialism. I often think that what we weave is not just cloth, but also the revolutionary spirit of Chinese textile workers. The more cloth we weave, the better, and the greater the contribution to the Chinese and world revolution. Thinking of revolution, my whole body is full of energy. Entering the workshop is like stepping onto the battlefield, putting all my thoughts on the cloth. Regardless of day or night shift, regardless of whether the work is easy or difficult, regardless of whether there is something going on at home, I put my heart on the cloth, and weave my heart into the cloth.

    First, put effort into ideological remolding
    In the past, we could unravel and re-weave defective cloth within eleven inches. Unraveling and re-weaving defective cloth made the cloth surface less firm, the printed colors less attractive, and the unravelled yarn was wasted; stopping the machine to unravel defective cloth also lowered production. The year before last, the factory experimented on my machine to only unravel defective cloth within two inches. To change a set of operating methods that we were familiar with and find a new path was very difficult for us weaving workers.
    At the beginning, without experience, I produced two defective cloths. I was extremely anxious: the work that the Party gave me was not done well, causing losses to the state. At this time, the factory was carrying out a "10,000-Meter Defect-Free Cloth Competition." My name was not on the "Honor Roll." Someone said: "This time, the advanced will not be advanced anymore." Some people also advised me not to continue the experiment.
    When I got home, I picked up Chairman Mao's "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to read. He said: "This army of ours is wholly dedicated to the liberation of the people and works entirely in the interests of the people." Chairman Mao said this, but was I thinking this way? The people wanted me to do this experiment, so I had to try it to the end, even if there were great difficulties. If I encountered a little difficulty and heard a few idle words and began to sulk, was this completely and thoroughly serving the people? For the interests of the people, even if my name was not on the honor roll for the rest of my life, I would be willing. If I went back to the old way and did not experiment, even if my name was on the "Honor Roll," it would not be honorable. Thinking it through, my heart became clear, and I was full of energy, so I put all my thoughts into it again.
    During the experiment, the Party and the worker comrades gave me great support. They said to me: Fuzhen, don't be anxious, boldly continue the experiment. I carefully explored new patrol routes, constantly practiced tying "correct knots," and slowly got on the right track. The second month, I no longer produced defective cloth. The factory summarized this experience and promoted it throughout the factory.
    I realized that reading Chairman Mao's books requires first putting effort into ideological remolding. Only by catching the "defects" in our thoughts can we completely and thoroughly devote ourselves to the revolutionary cause.

    "Modesty helps one to progress, pride makes one lag behind"
    Before liberation, I was a yarn spooler. My weaving and weaving skills were all learned from others later, all trained by myself. Taking "joining and starting the machine" as an example, there were eight movements. When the yarn broke, it had to be tied firmly with one knot; when the machine stopped, it had to be started easily. Each movement of weaving is a place for us to contribute to the people, and it is the basic skill of us weaving workers. In 1956, it took me more than twenty seconds to do these eight movements. After learning for eight years and practicing for eight years, I improved to ten seconds. Later, after practicing for a period of time, I shortened it by another second. By 1963, I could tie thirty-four knots per minute. In 1964, after another year of practice, I improved to thirty-six knots per minute at the end of the year. Chairman Mao said that many things, if there is no consciousness, will become our baggage. Learning technology is also like this, thinking that you are doing it quite fast, you will carry the burden on your back, and your feet will not be able to run.
    I realized that a person who is good in every way still has shortcomings, and a person who is bad in every way still has advantages. If you have Chairman Mao's words in your heart: "Modesty helps one to progress, pride makes one lag behind," you will often see your own shortcomings and the strengths of others, and you will learn something everywhere. The year before last, the workshop organized inter-shift inspections, and I saw Gu Gendi, a seventeen-year-old apprentice from Class C, scraping the coil head with both hands, her left hand as agile as her right hand. At that time, we all used our right hand to scrape the coil head. I felt that using both hands to scrape was faster and more even than using one hand, so I learned from her. The left hand did not listen to commands, and as it scraped, the yarn scissors fell into the belly of the machine. I thought that my left hand usually did too little labor and was too comfortable, and this time I had to transform it. From then on, I used my left hand to carry my bag to and from work; I used my left hand to hold chopsticks when eating; I used my left hand to scrub the washboard when washing clothes; I used my left hand to hold the broom when sweeping the floor; I used my left hand to scrape the coil head. If the yarn scissors fell a hundred times, I would pick them up a hundred times. Some workers said: "Your years of service are longer than her age, why are you still learning from her?" I said: "This point of hers is really good, why not learn!" After practicing for more than half a month, my left hand became agile.
    Learning technology should not be afraid of losing face. Ding Xiaomao in our group was really fast at threading heddle wires, she didn't even look at them, and with a move of both hands, she threaded them through. I found Ding Xiaomao and asked her to teach me this movement. She thought I was touching her sore spot, made a face, and ran home. At that time, I thought, this is awkward. If I just let it go, it will be difficult to learn from her in the future. I quickly chased after her, grabbed her, and said to her: "Xiaomao, I am sincerely learning from you. You teach me to thread heddle wires, and when I learn it, I will promote your experience in the group, and the output will increase." Xiaomao saw that I was sincerely learning from her, smiled, returned to the machine, and taught me by holding my hand.

    Winding workers can also be the masters of the machines
    I have been working in the cloth factory for almost twenty years, and I have never taken care of the machines. When the machine broke down, I would insert a red tag and call the maintenance worker to repair it. Last year, Comrade Qiu Suogui from Shijiazhuang State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 2 came to Shanghai to pass on his experience. Master Qiu is also a weaving and winding worker, and he also winds the car, looks at the coil head, looks at the cloth surface, and looks at the machine. When the machine has a problem, he knows it just by listening to it. At this time, I studied "On Practice" and understood that Master Qiu had this skill because he looked, listened, and touched more, that is, he practiced more. If I never touched the machine, even if I retired, I would still not understand the performance of the machine. To understand, you have to touch, touch, and practice. Understanding this principle, I became bolder. When the Cotton Textile Company held the Qiu Suogui Technical Training Class in the factory, I participated and moved my bedding to the factory. At night, I recited the code numbers of the machine parts over and over again; in the morning, I went into the workshop to look and touch, comparing the lectures with the real thing. After learning for five days, I understood the performance of more than seventy main items of a loom. This broke my superstition and made me understand a principle: as long as you dare to practice, winding workers can also be the masters of the loom.
    Master Qiu's experience was gradually promoted in the workshop. At the beginning, the defective cloth increased instead. Some people in the workshop "jumped up and down" and said: "Is promoting Master Qiu's experience really helping or not?" At this time, I thought, Chairman Mao taught us to make specific analyses of specific situations, so we went to the workshop to ask one by one: why is there defective cloth? The result was that many defective cloths were not produced on machines that were promoting Master Qiu's experience. However, I also heard someone say: "Learning from Master Qiu's experience, it is not easy to concentrate when winding the car, and defective cloth is easy to slip past." Is this the case? I asked the factory to let me go back to the car to do it myself. When I got on the car to do it myself, I felt that I had to look at the coil head and cloth surface, and also look at the machine, which was indeed a bit distracting. We analyzed the situation of the defective cloth. This month, the group produced forty defective cloths, only eight of which were caused by poor mechanical condition; thirty-two were caused by poor operation. This shows that winding workers should still focus on grasping the operation, supplemented by checking the machine. A loom has many parts, and the parts that have a greater relationship with defective cloth are the heald frame, the guidance, and the throwing parts. Checking the machine should also focus on checking these parts. After practicing this for a period of time, we summarized a new set of operating methods, combining cleaning, checking the cloth surface, and patrolling, with checking the heald frame, guidance, and throwing parts of the machine. By implementing this method, we grasped the main contradiction and the main aspect of the contradiction of producing defective cloth, and the strength was used on the edge of the knife. After the promotion, many new records of defect-free cloth for the whole group and the whole day appeared in the factory.

### “照毛主席的话去做，百用百灵”

    “照毛主席的话去做，百用百灵”
    上海国棉一厂挡车工人　杨富珍
    杨富珍同志在党的教育培养下，一心一意干革命，从一个普通的工人成长为无产阶级的先进战士，在平凡的工作中做出了不平凡的成绩。从一九五三年以来，她连续十三年月月超额完成国家计划，其中有八十多个月没有出过坏布。十多年来，她一直保持着先进生产者和五好工人的光荣称号。
    杨富珍同志为什么能够这样？这篇文章告诉我们：最根本的一条，是她怀着深厚的阶级感情，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。正如她所说的，毛主席的话，句句是为劳动人民写的，句句都是革命的真理；照毛主席的话去做，百用百灵。
    在旧社会，我没有读过一天书，解放后才摘掉文盲帽子。毛主席的教导，起初是从领导同志那里听来的。我听一点记一点，记一点做一点。从一九五九年开始，我学习毛主席著作。我一边学一边做。越学，越做，我越觉得毛主席的话，句句都是为我们劳动人民写的，句句都是革命的真理，照毛主席的话去做，百用百灵，百发百中。
    “毛主席的话象印板一样印在我心上”
    我是一九四九年春天入党的。入党不久，上海就解放了。当时，我想：革命，革命，就是要革国民党反动派的命，现在把国民党打倒了，还要革什么命呢？这时，党支部书记对我讲了一段毛主席的话：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”毛主席的话，象印板一样印在我的心上。我对自己说：富珍，富珍，革命还只是开了一个头，以后的路程更长，担子更重。现在党派我织布，织好布，就是党交给我的任务，布机就是我的战斗岗位。
    以后，经过党的不断教育，我懂得了，我们是为六亿五千万人织布，是为革命而织布。占世界四分之一人口穿衣的这副担子，一半落在我们工人肩膀上。我们织的布，有的是出口的，是要拿到国际市场上去，同资本主义国家的货色，同美帝国主义的货色比高低的。我常想，我们织的不仅是布，而且是中国纺织工人的革命志气。我们织的布越多越好，对中国和世界革命的贡献就越大。心里想到革命，浑身都是劲。人进车间，就象走上战场，全副心思都摆到布上去了。不管日班夜班，不管活计好做难做，不管家里有事没事，我都把一颗心贴在布上，把一颗心织在布上。
    首先要在思想改造上下功夫
    过去，我们出了十一吋以内的坏布可以拆了重织。坏布拆了重织，布面就不牢，印上颜色也不好看，拆下来的纱头也浪费了；停车拆坏布，产量也低了。前年，厂里在我的车子上试验只拆两吋以内的坏布。要把做熟了的一套操作方法改掉，重新走出一条路来，对我们织布工人来说，困难是很大的。
    开头，没有经验，出了两只坏布。我心里急得不得了：党交给我的工作没有做好，给国家造成了损失。这时，厂里正在搞“万米无次布竞赛”。“光荣榜”上没有我的名字。有人说：“这一下，先进要不先进了。”也有人劝我不要再试下去。
    回到家里，我拿起毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》来读。他老人家说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”毛主席这样说，我是不是这样想的呢？人民要我做这个试验，我就要把它试到底，就是有天大的困难，也要上。碰到一点困难，听到几句闲话，就发起闷来，这是不是完全、彻底地为人民服务呢？为了人民的利益，即使一辈子光荣榜上无名，也心甘情愿。如果走回头路，不去试验，就是名字上了“光荣榜”，也不光荣。想通了，心里亮堂了，劲头也足了，又把全副心思扑了上去。
    试验过程中，党和工人同志给了我很大的支持。他们对我说：富珍，不要急，大胆试下去。我用心摸索新的巡回路线，不断练习打“对结头”，慢慢地上了路。第二个月就没有再出坏布。厂里总结了这个经验，在全厂推广了。
    我体会到，读毛主席的书，首先要在改造思想上下功夫。只有把思想上的“疵点”捉掉，才能把一颗心完全、彻底地贴在革命事业上。
    “虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”
    解放前，我是纡子工。我的挡车织布技术，都是后来向别人学来的，都是自己练出来的。拿“接头开车”来说，就有八个动作。纱断了，要一结就牢；车停了，要一开就好。织布的每个动作，都是为人民出力的地方，都是我们织布工人的基本功。一九五六年，我做这八个动作一共要二十多秒钟。学了八年，练了八年，提高到十秒钟。以后练了一段时间，又缩短了一秒钟。到一九六三年，我一分钟能结三十四个头。一九六四年又练了一年，年底提高到一分钟结三十六个。毛主席说，许多东西如果没有自觉性就会成为我们的包袱。学技术也是这样，认为自己做得蛮快了，身上就背上了包袱，两只脚就跑不动了。
    我体会到，一个人好中好，总有不足的地方，差中差，总有可取的地方。如果心里有了毛主席这句话：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，就会常常看到自己的短处和别人的长处，就会处处学到东西。前年，车间里组织三班操作互查，我看到丙班的十七岁艺徒顾根娣，用双手刮盘头，她的左手和右手一样活络，当时，我们都是用右手刮盘头的。我觉得用两只手刮，比一只手刮，又快又均匀，我就向她学。左手不听指挥，刮着刮着，纱剪就落到车肚里去。我想左手平时劳动得太少，惬意惯了，这次我偏要把它改造过来。从此以后，上下班，我用左手拎包；吃饭，我用左手拿筷；洗衣服，我用左手搓擦板；扫地，我用左手握扫把；用左手刮盘头，纱剪掉一百次，我就拾一百次。有的工人说：“你的工龄比她年龄还大，怎么还向她学？”我说：“她这一点硬是好，为什么不学！”练了半个多月，我的左手活络了。
    学技术不能怕丢面子。我们小组的丁小毛，穿综丝的动作真快，眼睛也不看，两只手一弄，就穿过去了。我找到丁小毛，向她学这个动作。她以为我触她的霉头，面孔一板，就朝家里跑。当时我想，这倒弄僵了。如果就这样算了，以后再向她学就难了。我赶紧追上去，一把拉住她，对她说：“小毛，我是真心实意向你学。你教我穿综丝，我学会了，在小组里推广你的经验，产量就上去了。”小毛看出我是真心向她学，笑起来了，回到车子上，把着手教我。
    挡车工也可以做机器的主人
    我在布厂做了快二十年，一直不管机器。机器坏了，把红牌子一插，叫检修工来修。去年石家庄国棉二厂的仇锁贵同志到上海来传经。仇师傅也是织布挡车工，他又挡车，又看盘头，看布面，又看机器。机器有毛病，他一听就知道。这时，我学了《实践论》，懂得仇师傅有这手本事，无非是因为他多看、多听、多摸，也就是多实践的结果。如果我一直不去碰机器，就是到退休了，还是不懂得机器的性能。要懂，就要去碰、去摸、去实践。懂了这个道理，胆子就大了。棉纺公司在厂里举办仇锁贵技术训练班的时候，我就参加了，并且把铺盖也搬到厂里去。夜里，我一遍一遍背着机器零件的代号；一早，我进车间东看看西摸摸，把讲义同实物做对照。学了五天，一台布机七十几个主要项目的性能，都懂得了。这件事，打破了我的迷信，使我懂得了一个道理：只要敢于实践，挡车工也可以做布机的主人。
    仇师傅的经验在车间里逐步推广了。开头，坏布反而出多了。车间里有的人“跳脚”了，说：“推广仇师傅的经验，到底来事不来事？”这时，我想，毛主席教导我们，对具体情况要作具体分析，我们就到车间里一个一个地问：到底为什么会出坏布？结果发现很多坏布不是在推广仇师傅经验的车子上出的。但是，也听到有人说：“学习仇师傅的经验，挡车时精力不容易集中，坏布容易漏过去。”是不是这样？我向厂部要求让我回到车子上去做。自己上车一做，就感到又要看盘头、布面，又要看机器，的确有点分散精力。我们分析了出坏布的情况，这个月小组出了四十只坏布，因为机械状态不好而造成的只有八只；因为操作不好而造成的倒有三十二只。这说明：挡车工还是要以抓好操作为主，检查机器为辅。一台布机，有许多部分，同出坏布关系较大的是吊综、诱导、投打三个部分，检查机器，又要着重检查这几部分。这样实践了一段时间，总结出一套新的操作法，在做清洁工作、检查布面、跑巡回的同时，结合检查机器的吊综、诱导、投打三个部分。实行了这个办法，就抓住了出坏布的主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面，力气用到刀口上了，推广以后，全厂出现了很多全组全天无坏布的新纪录。
