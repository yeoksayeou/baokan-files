    U.S. imperialism has always regarded Ecuador as its colony. While monopolizing Ecuador's economy, it also controls the country's military, culture, and education.

    In July 1963, U.S. imperialism instigated a military coup in Ecuador, supporting a reactionary military dictatorship. After the reactionary military men came to power, they abolished all constitutional guarantees; prohibited gatherings, demonstrations, and all strikes; and arrested, imprisoned, and murdered thousands of patriots.

    In terms of foreign policy, the reactionary military clique relied on U.S. imperialism and sold out national interests, not only completely exempting foreign monopoly companies from taxes but also leasing large tracts of land in eastern and southeastern Ecuador to several American companies, allowing them to arbitrarily exploit oil and other minerals there. The military government also handed over Ecuador's electricity production to the control of American monopoly capital enterprises, causing Ecuador's economic situation to deteriorate, the number of unemployed to increase continuously, and the broad masses of people to live in extreme poverty.

    In order to fight for independence, democracy, and the right to live, the Ecuadorian people have continuously launched waves of anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorial struggles in the past two years. Under the strong pressure of the people, all members of the military government's cabinet were forced to resign.

    Now, the Ecuadorian people have gradually realized that only by uniting and resolutely struggling to overthrow the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs can they obtain independence, freedom, and democracy.

    This year, the Ecuadorian people have once again launched an anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorial struggle and are determined to carry on the struggle to victory.

    美帝侵略下的厄瓜多尔
    美帝国主义一直把厄瓜多尔当作它的殖民地。它在垄断厄瓜多尔经济的同时，还把这个国家的军事、文化、教育控制在手里。
    一九六三年七月，美帝国主义在厄瓜多尔策动军事政变，扶植了反动的军事独裁政权。反动军人上台之后，废除一切宪法保障；禁止集会、游行示威和一切罢工，逮捕、监禁和杀害了成千上万的爱国者。
    在对外政策方面，反动军人集团投靠美帝国主义、出卖民族利益，不但完全免除外国垄断公司的税额，而且把厄瓜多尔东部和东南部的大片土地租让给几家美国公司，让它们在那里任意开采石油和其它矿产。军政府还把厄瓜多尔的电力生产拱让于美国垄断资本企业控制，使厄瓜多尔的经济状况日益恶化，失业人数不断增加，广大人民处在生活赤贫的状况中。
    为了争取独立、民主和生活权利，近两年来厄瓜多尔人民不断掀起了反美反独裁斗争的浪潮。在人民的强大压力下，军政府内阁的全体成员被迫提出辞职。
    现在，厄瓜多尔人民已逐渐认识到，只有团结起来坚决斗争，推翻美帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治，他们才能获得独立、自由和民主。
    今年来，厄瓜多尔人民又一次掀起了反美反独裁的斗争，并且决心把斗争进行到胜利为止。
