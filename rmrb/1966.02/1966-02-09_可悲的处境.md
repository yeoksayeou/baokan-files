    The pro-American, traitorous Thai government, wholeheartedly serving the American policy of aggression, has received quite a lot of "U.S. aid." In the U.S.'s past "foreign aid" plans, Thailand has always been listed as a key "recipient" country. Especially this year, the "aid" to Thailand has surged, almost equaling the total amount of "aid" in the past fifteen years. It seems that the American master is rewarding its loyal lackey handsomely and generously.
    However, observing the situation in Thailand, one can understand that the facts are not so. The continuous flow of "U.S. aid" is of no benefit to Thailand and is entirely used for military expenditures needed by the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression. The "aid" funds are spent and still not enough, and Thailand has to lose its own capital to make up for the shortfall. Precisely because of this, Thailand's military expenditures are increasing year by year, the budget deficit is growing, and the financial economy is increasingly in trouble. Ancient Siamese kings bestowed white elephants on their subjects, which required huge feeding costs. On the surface, it was a reward, but in reality, it was increasing the burden on the subjects. Isn't today's Thailand somewhat like those favored ministers who received such rewards?
    U.S. imperialism, the biggest international exploiter, is engaged in cruel plunder all over the world. Even for its loyal lackeys, the greedy heart of U.S. imperialism will not change, and it will still squeeze them to the marrow. Giving "U.S. aid" seems to be a reward, but it is actually a bait, a means of plunder.
    Both being driven by the master and plundered by the master, this is the common fate of all of America's lackeys. It can be said that they are losing both the lady and the army. What's more, in the end, they will end up being buried with U.S. imperialism. The plight of a lackey who wholeheartedly lets U.S. imperialism lead him by the nose is truly pitiful and sad!

    可悲的处境
    泰国亲美卖国政府死心塌地为美国侵略政策效劳得到的“美援”颇为不少。在美国历年的“援外”计划中，泰国一向列为重点“受援”国之一，特别是今年给泰国的“援助”更是激增，几乎等于过去十五年“援助”款项的总和。看来，美国主子对于它的忠心的奴才似乎是犒赏丰厚、颇为大方的。
    但是，观察一下泰国的情况，人们就可以明白事实决非如此。源源而来的“美援”，对泰国并无半点好处，完全用之于美帝国主义侵略政策所需要的军事开支。“援助”的款项花完了不够，泰国还得赔出老本来弥补不足。正因为这样，泰国军费开支逐年增加，预算赤字日益庞大，财政经济越来越陷于困境。古代暹罗国王赐给其臣子以需要巨大养费的白象，表面上是赏赐，实质上是加重臣子的负担。今天的泰国不正是有点象那些受到赏赐的宠臣的处境吗？
    美帝国主义这个最大的国际剥削者，在全世界到处进行残酷的掠夺。即使对于它的忠实的奴才，美帝国主义贪婪的心肠也不会有什么改变，同样要敲骨吮髓地进行压榨。给“美援”，看来是犒赏，实际上却是一种鱼饵，是一种掠夺的手法。
    既受主子驱使，还受主子掠夺，这是一切美国的奴才的共同命运。这可以说得上是赔了夫人又折兵。更何况，到头来还将落得个为美帝国主义殉葬的下场。死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，其处境真是可怜复可悲！
