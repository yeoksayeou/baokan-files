　　Henan's Leaders at All Levels Study Jiao Yulu
　　Using the "Arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to Shoot the "Target" of Actual Work
	The news items published here raise an important question: leading cadres at all levels must learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu.
	Leading cadres participating in the enlarged meeting of the Lanzhou Military Region Party Committee of the People's Liberation Army, through studying Comrade Jiao Yulu's exemplary deeds, further recognized the great significance of leading cadres taking the lead in revolutionizing themselves. They believe that to be a good "squad leader" like Comrade Jiao Yulu, standing at the forefront, one must first "transform" oneself; to treat Chairman Mao's books as the highest directives, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and work hard on the application of words, one must reveal one's personal thoughts, apply what one has learned, and correct one's mistakes if they exist; to carry out revolution for a lifetime like Comrade Jiao Yulu, one must "transform" for a lifetime, always maintain revolutionary youthfulness, and continuously revolutionize and advance.
	These news items powerfully illustrate that learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu in the spirit of rectification will certainly promote the revolutionization of leadership thinking.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th, leading comrades from provincial-level leadership organs to Party committees of various regions, counties (cities) are personally taking the lead in studying the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu. They are universally adopting the method of rectification learning, using Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror to strictly examine their thoughts and work, identify shortcomings, formulate measures, and improve leadership work.
    Many Party committee leaders believe that, compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, the most fundamental gap is the failure to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works as he did, taking Chairman Mao's instructions as the highest standard in every word and deed. The Shangqiu Prefectural Party Committee believes in its discussion that if Shangqiu's appearance is to be changed, the key lies in the Prefectural and County Party committees drumming up revolutionary zeal and doing a good job of investigation and research. To achieve these two points, it is necessary to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and dare to change the world. They are determined to lead the people of the entire region to further eliminate waterlogging, control alkali, and prevent sand, and completely change the face of the old disaster area. Party committees in various regions also recognize that studying Chairman Mao's works must be like Jiao Yulu, with deep class feelings, with a strong desire to change the face of the region, in order to truly connect with reality, creatively study and apply, and use the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot the "target" of actual work.
    Many Party members, cadres, especially leading cadres, have consciously examined and criticized the thoughts of putting "I" first, "fear" first, and "difficulty" first in their studies. County Party secretaries of many counties such as Xunxian, Yanjin, Shangqiu, Kaifeng, and Changyuan have all examined: having been sent by the Party to work in disaster-stricken areas, why could Comrade Jiao Yulu blaze a correct path for changing Lankao's appearance in just over a year, while they themselves did nothing? Their common answer is: lacking Comrade Jiao Yulu's thorough revolutionary spirit of dedicating himself to the people in the disaster area, not being like Jiao Yulu who "has all the people in his heart, and only lacks himself," and still having personal distracting thoughts in their minds. Because of being entangled in personal distracting thoughts, the mental state is not energetic, afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind, daring not to think, daring not to act, simply seeking stability, unwilling to take risks, doing what others do, unwilling to rush to the front. Everyone expressed that in learning from Jiao Yulu, they must learn his fearless spirit of daring to fight and daring to break through for the people, and make greater contributions to completely changing the face of disaster areas and building a new socialist countryside.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's mass line working style, high revolutionary enthusiasm, and moving deeds of persisting in investigation and research and mastering first-hand materials deeply educate and encourage people. Li Bailin, deputy district head of the XInxiang suburban district, who was transferred from the industrial sector only half a month ago and is responsible for the transformation of more than 1,000 mu of saline-alkali land in the suburbs, initially felt helpless. After studying Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, he received great education. The next day, he went deep into the fields to observe the alkali situation and grasp first-hand information.

### 河南各级负责同志学习焦裕禄　以毛泽东思想之“矢”射实际工作之“的”

　　河南各级负责同志学习焦裕禄
　　以毛泽东思想之“矢”射实际工作之“的”
    这里发表的几条消息，提出了一个重要问题：各级领导干部更要向焦裕禄同志学习。
    参加解放军兰州部队党委扩大会议的领导干部，通过学习焦裕禄的模范事迹，进一步认识到领导干部带头革命化的重大意义。他们认为，要象焦裕禄同志那样当好“班长”，站在排头，必须先从自己
  “化”起；要象焦裕禄同志那样把毛主席的书当作最高指示，在用字上狠下功夫，必须把个人的思想亮出来，学了就用，错了就改；要象焦裕禄同志那样干一辈子革命，必须“化”一辈子，永葆革命青春，不断革命，不断前进。
    这几条消息有力地说明了：用整风精神向焦裕禄同志学习，必能得到促进领导思想革命化的效果。
                      编者
    据新华社郑州二十日电  河南省从省直属领导机关到各地、县（市）委的负责同志，都亲自带头学习焦裕禄同志的事迹。他们普遍采用整风学习的方法，以焦裕禄同志为镜子，严格检查思想和工作，找差距，订措施，改进领导工作。
    许多党委领导同志认为，与焦裕禄同志比较，最根本的差距是没有象他那样活学活用毛主席著作，一言一行都以毛主席的指示作为最高准则。中共商丘地委在讨论中认为，要想改变商丘的面貌，关键在于地委和县委鼓足革命干劲，做好调查研究工作。要做到这两条，就必须象焦裕禄同志那样，活学活用毛主席著作，敢于改天换地。他们决心领导全区人民进一步除涝、治碱、防沙，彻底改变老灾区面貌。各地党委还认识到，学习毛主席著作必须象焦裕禄那样，带着深厚的阶级感情，带着改变本地区面貌的强烈愿望，才能真正联系实际，活学活用，以毛泽东思想之“矢”，射实际工作之“的”。
    许多党员、干部，特别是领导干部，在学习中自觉地检查批判了“我”字当头，“怕”字当头，“难”字当头的思想。浚县、延津、商丘、开封、长垣等许多县的县委书记，都检查：同是受党的派遣到受灾地区工作，为什么焦裕禄同志能在一年多的时间内，为改变兰考面貌闯出一条正确的道路，而自己则无所作为？他们的共同回答是：缺乏焦裕禄同志那种为灾区人民献身的彻底革命精神，不象焦裕禄那样“心里装着全体人民，唯独没有他自己”，思想上还有个人杂念。由于被个人杂念缠绕，精神状态就不振作，前怕狼，后怕虎，不敢想，不敢干，单纯求稳，不愿担风险，人家咋办咱咋办，不愿冲在前面。大家表示，学习焦裕禄，一定把他为人民敢打敢闯的大无畏精神学到手，为彻底改变灾区面貌，建设社会主义新农村作出更大贡献。
    焦裕禄同志的群众路线的工作作风，高度的革命热忱，坚持调查研究、掌握第一手材料的动人事迹，深深教育和鼓舞着人们。新乡市郊区副区长李百林，半月前才从工业部门调来，分工负责抓郊区一千多亩盐碱地的改造，开始感到没有办法，当学了焦裕禄同志的事迹后，受到很大教育。第二天他就深入田间观察碱情，掌握第一手资料。
