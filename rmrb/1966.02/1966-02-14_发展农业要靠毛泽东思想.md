    Developing Agriculture Depends on Mao Zedong Thought
    Zhang Tilun, Secretary of the Party Branch of the Nan Zhangdai Brigade, Menlouzhuang Commune, Pinggu County, Beijing
    In our country, what do we rely on to develop agriculture and increase grain production? The most fundamental thing is to have Mao Zedong Thought in command; to highlight politics, which means to have all commune members study Chairman Mao’s books well, understand the principle of farming for the revolution and farming with science. There is no other way.
  Rely on Chairman Mao's Works to Promote the Ideological Revolutionization of People
    In actual work, we increasingly realize that the most important content of ideological and political work is to organize cadres and the masses to study Chairman Mao’s works and use Mao Zedong Thought to mobilize people’s positive factors. Highlighting politics means highlighting Mao Zedong Thought. When the masses have ideological problems, you can tell them what they should do and what they shouldn't; this is also called ideological and political work. But there is another way, which is to take out Chairman Mao's books and let the masses know what Chairman Mao said. In this way, it works immediately, solves the problem thoroughly, and has a long-term effect. We feel this is because Chairman Mao enjoys a very high prestige among the masses, his words are truth, he speaks deeply, thoroughly, and is easy to understand. Of course, this requires a process of publicity and organization. Propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought should also be easy to understand. We adopt the method of using specific examples to illustrate the problem. For example, Chairman Mao said in the past that he could overthrow Japan and Chiang Kai-shek, and he did; he proposed to overthrow the landlords, and we were able to divide the land; he said that organizing is good, and we have today’s good life; he said agricultural mechanization, and we have electric wells to irrigate, and so on. Chairman Mao also leads us to engage in the three great revolutionary movements, and he will certainly be able to realize them. The masses understand it at once, and the more they listen, the more they believe.
    In 1962, our brigade suffered from flooding, and the morale of the commune members was low, and some people looked forward to government relief. At that time, I organized everyone to study a passage from “The Present Situation and Our Tasks After the Victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan”: “We emphasize regeneration through our own efforts. We can rely on our own organized strength to defeat all reactionary forces at home and abroad.” And from “Must Learn How to Do Economic Work”: “We advocate self-reliance. We hope to have foreign aid, but we cannot rely on it. We rely on our own efforts, on the creativity of all soldiers and civilians." Everyone also compared the different experiences of suffering disasters in the old and new societies, and unanimously agreed: Chairman Mao is right, we must follow Chairman Mao’s instructions. The slogan "If the low-lying land is lost, find upland; if the grain is lost, find vegetables; if the early crop is lost, find the late crop" was put forward. I checked the disaster situation piece by piece with the commune members and made measures. We propped up the corn and millet that had been knocked down, sharpened and topdressed the late corn; and cultivated the sweet potato fields to reduce the soil moisture content. As a result, grain production increased compared to the previous year. Not only did we not need state relief, but we also sold 215,000 jin of grain to the state. It is like this. With Mao Zedong Thought, people’s mental outlook has changed, and even if they suffer disasters, they can withstand it.
    In the past, there was an old poor peasant in our brigade who often said strange things, cursing and complaining, and no one could do anything about it. Some comrades believed that such people should only be criticized and suppressed. I thought that the more you criticize, the bigger the problem will be. I analyzed that he had a good background, and there must be a struggle between advanced and backward ideas in his mind. We must seize the positive factors in his thinking and, according to the viewpoint of “On Contradiction,” promote the transformation of the contradiction. One day, we found him driving away a pig eating wheat seedlings in the field, so we praised him. The next morning, he watered the two trees in front of the door, so we praised him again and called on the commune members to learn from him. He was very happy and went home and educated his son to obey the leadership, work hard, and be on time for work. His son practiced well in military training and was also praised. Since then, he has completely changed, often sweeping the streets and carrying water for military families and households in difficulty. As a result, he was named a Five-Good Commune Member in 1965.
    Because we paid attention to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, the political atmosphere among the commune members has been greatly strengthened, the idea of "farming for the revolution" has taken root in people's hearts, and has become a practical action. Good people and good deeds that are wholeheartedly for the collective and caring for others are constantly emerging. Commune members have tasted the sweetness of studying Chairman Mao's works, and more and more people are participating in the study.
  Rely on Dialectics to Farm
    What kind of grain you plant, what kind of grain you harvest, this is certain, but how much you harvest must be determined by people. As long as people’s enthusiasm is fully mobilized, and they dare to make revolution and transform nature, unfavorable conditions can be changed. We put forward the slogan of “Seize high yields, change from poor to rich.” The measure is to thoroughly transform depressions and replace sand. Some masses said: "You can't harvest ten thousand shi of grain without a thousand mu of land." "Our village has bad conditions, and there is no way to change it." We organized the masses to study the passage: “Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things. The comparison of strength is not only a comparison of military and economic strength, but also a comparison of manpower and morale. Military and economic strength must be mastered by people.” In the discussion, everyone realized that people with revolutionary spirit can master the land and change the land. The land depends on people to cultivate. Under the same conditions, what determines whether grain can achieve high yields is people, not the land. Some people gave examples: "Garden land is also land, why can it produce high yields? Isn't it because the water and fertilizer conditions are good?" As soon as this was said, everyone became energetic. The commune members said: “Sweat a little this winter, and guarantee increased production next year.” As a result, two hundred mu of hilly land were transformed into terraces in one winter and one spring, four hundred mu of low-lying land were transformed into platform fields, and six hundred mu of sandy land were covered with pit mud and transformed into good land. When the land changed, the yield went up. In 1958, the yield per mu was 158 jin, and the state's grain supply was still needed; by 1965, the yield per mu had increased to 670 jin, and 475,000 jin of surplus grain was sold to the state. The commune members said: "Chairman Mao's works have great power, and barren land can be moved."
    In production, the struggle between new and old ideas, between progressive and backward ideas, is constant. In 1963, we encountered this problem when we promoted close planting and growing two crops. The masses could not accept close planting, and they said: "The ridges are big, the seedlings are sparse, the stalks are thick, a lot of grain is harvested, and a lot of stalks are produced." It is certainly not feasible to force it. Chairman Mao said: “When the masses are not yet conscious, we must attack, which is adventurism. If we insist on leading the masses to do things they are unwilling to do, the result will inevitably be failure.” What to do? We organized a three-way combination of veteran farmers, cadres, and technicians to conduct experiments together, use facts to change the commune members' views, promote the role of internal factors, and make the adoption of new technologies a conscious and voluntary action of the masses. At first, some commune members did not believe that it could succeed and wanted to bet with me. In the autumn, among the more than 120 mu of closely planted wheat with small ridges, 60 mu had a yield of 428 jin per mu, 15 mu had a yield of 523 jin per mu, and the other 55 mu had a yield of 320 jin per mu. The yield of land that was not closely planted was low. Some commune members said again: Small plots can increase production, but large plots cannot. We organized everyone to study the discussion in "On Contradiction" on the law of recognizing things from the particular to the general, and then from the general to the particular, so that everyone realized that since small plots can increase production, large plots can be planted in the same way, and they can also increase production. By 1964, we had completely changed to close planting with small ridges, and the yield was doubled compared to the past. In 1963, I grew dozens of mu of wheat intercropped with corn in the Second Team, with a yield of more than 590 jin per mu. In 1965, I grew two crops of barley and rice, with a yield of more than 1,600 jin per mu. At this time, the commune members said that they were planting less.
    In 1965, cotton was planted carefully and well, and the determination to increase production was also great. But flower buds could not appear on time. The technicians said with their books: “The latest time for budding must not be later than June 20, otherwise, the frost will reduce the production of flowers.” The masses said: "Cotton is not shy, it grows all autumn." Regardless of which view, they all regarded the cotton growing period as unchanged and dead. We studied “On Practice.” Chairman Mao said: “If you want to have knowledge, you must participate in the practice of transforming reality.” I thought, why doesn't cotton bud? Won't we know after participating in labor? So I participated in cotton field management and, after observation, saw that it was cold when sowing, and then there was drought and water shortage, and I relied on book experience, and always kept the seedlings low, so it did not bud. We analyzed that the weather is not absolute, we must change the conditions, promote its growth, strive to bud on time, and eliminate frost flowers. After we took measures to irrigate and topdress, it grew up at once. As a result, the yield per mu reached 118 jin. Using materialist dialectics to break metaphysics, turning unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions. As a result, not only was the cotton harvested, but once again we tasted the sweetness of studying Chairman Mao's works.
    In the spring of 1965, I went to Shanghai to visit, and saw the great achievements of the Shanghai people in farming for the revolution, and especially the grid fields made in Nanhui County attracted me the most. After returning to the village, I went to the Second Team to make grid fields. The initial plan was to plant corn on the ridges, beans on the sides of the ridges, and rice and dry rice at the bottom of the ditch. As soon as the masses heard it, they said it would not work. They told me: the ridges are small and the seedlings are dense, so it is impossible to cultivate, and it will fall over in a gust of wind. Shanghai has a long frost-free period, and the north has a short frost-free period, so the rice will not ripen and delay the planting of wheat. I also hit a muffled thunder. Was I wrong, or did the masses not accept new things? So, I read “On Practice.” Chairman Mao said: “If people want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to obtain the results they expect, they must make their ideas conform to the laws of the objective world. If they do not conform, they will fail in practice.” I thought, I subjectively wanted to do a good job, but I didn't consider the climate and varieties, and I didn't consult with the masses. Chairman Mao’s words criticized me specifically. So, I checked the errors of subjectivism, blind actionism, and showing-off-ism at the commune members' meeting. Everyone studied the plan together, in accordance with the basic requirements and practices of grid fields, adapted to local conditions, and changed the crop arrangement. As a result, the yield per mu was more than 860 jin. And the same land, the old planting method only received more than 700 jin. This time, I not only touched on some of the laws of growing grid fields, but more importantly, it made me further understand that farming must be honest and rely on the masses, which is more meaningful to me than producing a few hundred more jin of grain.

    发展农业要靠毛泽东思想
    北京平谷县门楼庄公社南张岱大队党支部书记　张体伦
    在我们国家里，发展农业，增产粮食靠什么？最根本的一条就是靠毛泽东思想挂帅；突出政治，也就是让全体社员学好毛主席的书，懂得种地为革命、种地讲科学的道理，别的路是没有的。
  靠毛主席著作促进人的思想革命化
    在实际工作中，我们越来越体会到思想政治工作最重要的内容就是组织干部、群众学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想去调动人的积极因素。突出政治也就是突出毛泽东思想。群众有了思想问题，你给他讲应当这样，不应当那样，这也叫思想政治工作；但是还有一种办法，就是拿出毛主席的书来，让群众知道毛主席是怎么说的。这样，一讲就灵，而且解决得彻底，长期起作用。我们觉得这是因为毛主席在群众中享有很高的威望，他说的话是真理，讲得深，讲得透，容易懂。当然，这要有个宣传和组织的过程。宣传毛主席思想，也要通俗易懂。我们采取的是用具体事例说明问题的方法，比如，毛主席过去说能打倒日本、打倒蒋介石，就打倒了；提出打倒地主，我们就分得了土地；说组织起来好，我们就有了今天的好生活；说农业机械化，我们就有了电井能浇地等等。毛主席又领导我们搞三大革命运动，也一定能实现。群众一点就通，越听越信服。
    一九六二年，我们大队受涝灾，社员情绪低落，有些人指望政府救济。当时，我就组织大家学习《抗日战争胜利后的时局和我们的方针》里的一段：“我们强调自力更生，我们能够依靠自己组织的力量，打败一切中外反动派。”和《必须学会做经济工作》里的：“我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”大家又对比了新旧社会受灾后的不同遭遇，一致认为：毛主席说的对，一定按毛主席的指示去做。提出“洼地丢了上地找，粮食丢了蔬菜找，早的丢了晚的找”的口号。我同社员逐块查灾情，订措施。把冲倒的玉米、谷子一棵棵扶起来，给晚玉米削尖、追肥；给白薯地中耕，减少土壤含水量。结果粮食反而比上年增产，不但没要国家救济，还卖给国家二十一万五千斤粮食。就是这样，有了毛主席思想，改变了人的精神面貌，受了灾也可以顶住。
    过去我们大队有个老贫农，经常说怪话，骂骂咧咧，谁也奈何不得。有些同志认为对这样的人只有批评，压一压。我想，越批评疙瘩会越大。我分析，他出身好，思想上也必然有先进与落后的斗争，一定要抓住他思想上的积极因素，按《矛盾论》的观点，促使矛盾转化。有一天，我们发现他在地里赶走一头吃麦苗的猪，就表扬了他。第二天一早，他又挑水浇了门前的两棵树，又表扬了他，并且号召社员向他学习。他很高兴，回家又教育他儿子要服从领导，好好干，按时出勤。他儿子练兵好，也得到了表扬。从此，他完全转变了，经常扫街，给军属和困难户挑水。结果在一九六五年被评为五好社员。
    由于我们注意了用毛主席思想调动群众的积极性，社员中政治空气大大加强，“种田为革命”的思想深入人心，并已成为实际行动。一心为集体，关心别人的好人好事不断出现。社员尝到了学习毛主席著作的甜头，参加学习的人越来越多。
    靠辩证法种田
    种什么粮食收什么粮食，这是肯定的，可是收多少，就得由人来决定。只要充分调动人的积极性，敢于革命，敢于改造自然，就能改变不利的条件。我们提出“夺高产，穷变富”的口号，措施是彻底改洼换沙。有的群众说：“没有千顷地，别想打万石粮。”“我们庄条件不好，没法改变。”我们就组织群众学习了“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。军力和经济力是要人去掌握的。”一段话。在讨论中，大家认识到：具有革命精神的人能掌握土地，改变土地。地靠人去种。同样的条件，决定粮食能不能高产的是人，不是土地。有的举例说：“园子地也是地，为什么能高产，还不是水肥条件好？”这样一说，大家的劲头就起来了。社员说：“今冬流点汗，明年保增产。”结果，二百亩岗地，用了一冬一春的时间就改成梯田，四百亩洼地也改成台田，六百来亩沙地铺上坑泥，改成了好地。土地变，产量就上去了。一九五八年，亩产一百五十八斤，还要吃国家供应粮；到一九六五年，亩产提高到六百七十斤，卖给国家余粮四十七万五千斤。社员说：“毛主席著作力量大，瘠薄土地能搬家。”
    在生产中，新旧思想、进步与落后思想之间的斗争是经常存在的。一九六三年，我们推广密植和种两茬作物时，就遇到这个问题。群众对密植还接受不了，他们说：“垄大苗稀秸秆粗，粮食不少打，秸秆不少出。”硬推行当然不行。毛主席说：“当着群众还不觉悟的时候，我们要进攻，那是冒险主义。群众不愿干的事，我们硬要领导他们去干，其结果必然失败。”怎么办？我们就组织老农、干部、技术员三结合共同试验，用事实改变社员的看法，推动内因起作用，使采用新技术成为群众自觉自愿的行动。开始，有些社员不相信能成功，要跟我打赌。到秋后，一百二十多亩小垄密植的小麦中，有六十亩亩产四百二十八斤，有十五亩亩产五百二十三斤，另五十五亩亩产三百二十斤。没密植的地，产量就低。有的社员又说：小片可以增产，大片就不行了。我们又组织大家学习了《矛盾论》里认识事物由特殊到一般，再由一般到特殊的规律的论述，使大家认识到既然小片能增产，大片地一样种法，也能增产。到一九六四年，我们全改成小垄密植，产量比过去提高一倍。一九六三年，我在二队搞了几十亩小麦套种玉米，亩产五百九十多斤。一九六五年又搞大麦、稻子两茬，亩产一千六百多斤。这时候社员反而说种少了。
    一九六五年，棉花种得细，种得好，增产的决心也大。可是不能按时现蕾。技术员抱着书本说：“现蕾最晚不能过六月二十日，不然霜后花减产。”群众却说：“棉花不害羞，里里拉拉长一秋。”不管哪种看法，都把棉花生长期看成是不变的、死的。我们就学习《实践论》，毛主席说：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。”我想，棉花为什么不现蕾，参加劳动后不就知道了吗？于是我就参加棉田管理，经过观察，看出来是下种时天寒，以后又天旱缺水，又套书本经验，老蹲苗，因此不现蕾。我们分析，天时不是绝对的，要改变条件，促使它生长，争取按时现蕾，消灭霜后花。我们采取了浇水、追肥的措施以后，一下子就长上来了。结果亩产达到一百一十八斤。运用唯物辩证法大破形而上学，变不利条件为有利条件。结果，不仅棉花得到丰收，而且再一次尝到了学习毛主席著作的甜头。
    一九六五年春季，我去上海参观，看到了上海人民种田为革命、实干苦干的巨大成绩，特别是南汇县搞的格子田对我吸引力最大。回村以后，我就到二队去搞格子田，初步方案是埂上种玉米，埂边种豆子，沟底种水、旱稻。群众一听就说不行，他们告诉我：垄小、苗密不能中耕，一刮风就要倒伏，上海无霜期长，北方无霜期短，稻子熟不了，又耽误种麦。我也打了闷雷，是我错了，还是群众不接受新鲜事物呢？于是，我就看《实践论》，毛主席说：“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。”我就想，我主观上想搞好，却不顾气候、品种，也没跟群众商量。毛主席这话就象专批评我一样。于是，我就在社员会上检查了主观主义、盲动主义、风头主义的错误。大家一块研究计划，按格子田的基本要求和做法，因地制宜，改变了作物安排。结果亩产八百六十多斤。而一样的地，老种法只收七百多斤。这一次，我不仅摸到了种格子田的一些规律，更重要的是使我进一步懂得种田必须老老实实，依靠群众，这对我来说比多打几百斤粮食的意义还要大。
