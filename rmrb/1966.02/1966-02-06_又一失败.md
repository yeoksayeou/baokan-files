	Another Failure
	The American aggressors recently mobilized tens of thousands of troops and launched the so-called "five-pronged offensive" in South Vietnam, resulting in a serious defeat. The "lawnmower" was mowed down, the "mallet" hit an iron hammer, the "deerskin" was torn to shreds...

	The mad offensive launched by the American aggressors against the South Vietnamese liberated areas after the Spring Festival aimed to weaken the South Vietnamese people's armed forces, expand its aggressive territory, and lay the foundation for further expanding the war. Therefore, it spared no expense, resorted to all means, and attempted to take advantage of the South Vietnamese people's armed forces by surprise, launching a large-scale sudden attack to reap a big harvest. However, just as Sun Wukong could not escape the palm of the Buddha, no matter how cunning and cruel the American aggressors were, they could not deal with the South Vietnamese People's Liberation Army and guerrillas who had mastered the magic weapon of people's war. The American aggressors' "sweeps" were thwarted one by one in the face of the South Vietnamese army and people's counter-"sweeps." In a single battle in Bong Son, Binh Dinh Province, more than 500 American aggressor troops and South Korean puppet troops were annihilated.

	Attempting to salvage defeat, the American aggressors are continuing to invest even larger stakes and are brazenly releasing poisonous gas. However, this obviously cannot save the lives of the American aggressor troops and their accomplices; it can only further arouse the hatred of the South Vietnamese army and people and subject them to even more severe punishment.

	The brilliant victory recently achieved by the South Vietnamese people in crushing the American aggressors' offensive has once again demonstrated to the people of the world their invincible strength. The end point of US imperialism's expanding war can only be complete failure, and nothing else.

### 又一失败

    又一失败
    美国侵略者最近出动了好几万的兵力，在南越发动了所谓“五路攻势”，结果遭到了严重的挫败。“捣碎机”被捣碎，“木槌”碰到了铁锤，“鹿皮”被撕得稀烂……
    美国侵略者在春节后对南越解放区发动的疯狂进攻，目的是想要削弱南越人民武装力量，扩大它的侵略地盘，为进一步扩大战争奠定基础的。因此，它不惜巨资，不择手段，并且企图乘南越人民武装之不备，来个大规模的突然袭击，捞它一把。但是，正如孙悟空逃不出如来佛的手掌一样，美国侵略者不管怎样诡计多端，不管怎样凶狠残酷，都无法对付掌握了人民战争这一法宝的南越人民解放军和游击队。美国侵略者的“扫荡”，在南越军民的反“扫荡”面前，一个一个被挫败。单是在平定省蓬山的一次战斗中，美国侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军就被歼灭了五百多名。
    企图挽救失败，美国侵略者正在继续投入更大的赌注，而且悍然大放毒气。但是，这显然都救不了美国侵略军及其帮凶的命，它只能更加激起南越军民的仇恨，使他们遭到更加严重的惩罚。
    南越人民最近在粉碎美国侵略者进攻中取得的辉煌胜利，再一次向全世界人民显示了他们不可战胜的力量。美帝国主义扩大战争的终点只能是彻底失败，而绝不能是其他。
