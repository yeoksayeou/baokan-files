    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 5th (Electric Dispatch) - The Vietnamese magazine "Hoc Tap" (Study) published an article by General Vo Nguyen Giap in its January issue, stating that "Johnsonism is a concentrated manifestation of the most blatant, greedy, and insidious neo-colonialist policy of aggression of US imperialism. The aggressive war waged by US imperialism in this new phase will be even more intense, and at the same time, their deceptive tricks will be even more cunning. However, our people will never waver in the face of their threats, nor will they harbor the slightest ambiguity about their hypocritical arguments."

    The article, titled "The Entire Nation Is of One Mind, Vigorously Advancing the Great Patriotic War, Resolutely Defeating the American Aggressor Bandits," pointed out that the US imperialists' "special warfare" strategy, which had reached its highest stage, had fundamentally failed. Precisely because of this failure and passive situation, it has adopted a new strategy to intensify the war. It has dispatched more than 200,000 American troops and puppet troops on a large scale to South Vietnam, while recklessly carrying out "gradual escalation" attacks on North Vietnam, attempting to reverse the situation in South Vietnam and strategically seize the initiative.

    The article stated that the US imperialists' action of massively increasing expeditionary forces to South Vietnam has pushed the war of aggression to a new stage. This is not a general troop deployment to change the war plan, but a step to shift the war of aggression to a new strategic stage. Under the grave situation of the US imperialists pushing the war of aggression against Vietnam to a new stage, the article analyzed in detail the strengths and weaknesses of both the enemy and ourselves, and came to the conclusion that "in the end, the enemy will be defeated, and we will win." The article pointed out that although US imperialism is an international gendarme, the number one imperialist in the imperialist camp with the greatest economic and military potential, and possesses a certain degree of strong material strength, it has the most fundamental weaknesses in military and political terms, and even in strategic and tactical terms. From an overall perspective, the balance of power in the world is not advantageous to US imperialism, but rather puts it at a disadvantage. It also has to disperse its forces and passively deal with various regions. The very fact that US imperialism sent expeditionary forces to directly invade Vietnam carries with it the following most fundamental and insurmountable weaknesses:

    First, the US imperialists' direct invasion of Vietnam makes their aggressive face even more exposed, and the traitorous face of their running dogs even more exposed, thus making the contradiction between US imperialism and our nation even more acute and intensified. All our people hate the aggressor bandits even more and unite more widely and closely in the ranks of the national united front against US imperialism and its running dogs. All patriotic forces are more determined to fight and defend their homes and country. Many Vietnamese people in areas temporarily controlled by the enemy have gradually seen through their aggressive and traitorous true colors.

    Second, the US imperialists are sending troops to invade our country precisely when their "special warfare" strategy has fundamentally gone bankrupt, our people's patriotic war is developing with a vigorous momentum, the liberation armed forces have grown stronger, and the liberated areas have occupied most of the population and land in the South. Therefore, even if it sends hundreds of thousands more troops, it cannot escape the passive situation strategically. Not only can it not easily regain the initiative, but on the contrary, it may sink deeper and deeper into the quagmire of defeat.

    Third, due to the aforementioned political and military passivity, no matter how modernized the equipment of the American expeditionary force is, it cannot exert its combat effectiveness. It will inevitably be defeated by the nation that stands up to resolutely resist it. Because this war is unjust, the American expeditionary force does not know why it is fighting, their morale is low, and coupled with their unfamiliarity with the terrain and the huge difficulties in supply and logistics, they cannot cope with a people's war.

    Fourth, the more directly the US military engages in aggression, the more isolated and divided the ranks of the puppet army and puppet regime become, and the more the contradictions between US imperialism and its running dogs develop. Even those in the puppet army and puppet regime who have a little patriotism are becoming increasingly aware, and more and more people are standing on the side of the people. Therefore, the more troops US imperialism increases, the more it not only cannot save the predicament of the puppet army and puppet regime, but on the contrary, under the blows of our people's resistance forces, the puppet army will be increasingly annihilated and disintegrated, and the puppet regime will increasingly collapse.

    Fifth, the more US imperialism provokes war in the South, the more it is strongly condemned by the peace-loving people of the world.

    The article pointed out that "the advantages of US imperialism are limited, while its weaknesses are fundamental. In the development of this war of aggression, these weaknesses will become increasingly exposed and deepened, and will inevitably lead to the shameful failure of US imperialism."

    The article went on to say, "As for our side, we are a nation with a small land area and a small population, but we are uniting to resolutely wage a just and patriotic war to defend our own survival and strive for national independence and peace. Facing a ferocious enemy like US imperialism, our strength has continuously developed in fierce and prolonged revolutionary wars, and has repeatedly forced the enemy to suffer慘 defeat. While we have weaknesses in equipment, technology, and economic strength, we possess absolute advantages in political and spiritual terms, we have a correct leadership line, we have the united strength of the entire people, we have an invincible people's war, and we also have the sympathy and strong support of the people of the world. Therefore, we will definitely become stronger and win more victories in the war. This is the basic factor that determines the final victory of our people in the sacred war of resistance against America to save the nation, even if US imperialism increases its expeditionary force by hundreds of thousands, they cannot change the historical law that they will ultimately be defeated and we will ultimately win."

    The article emphasized that the US imperialists' direct aggression against our country makes their aggressive face even more exposed, and the aggressive and unjust nature of this war provoked by them is nakedly exposed to world opinion. The righteousness of our people's patriotic struggle shines even more brightly. The article said, US imperialism's aggression is unjust, and our people are just, but who will ultimately defeat whom? Will our people win or will US imperialism win? Every time US imperialism implements a new aggressive conspiracy over the past eleven years, this question has been raised. The history of the heroic liberation struggle of the Southern people has already given a powerful answer: no matter what conspiracies and tricks US imperialism adopts, US imperialism will ultimately be defeated. The basic law of the great patriotic struggle of our Southern compatriots through various stages is: the more US imperialism and its running dogs promote conspiracies to enslave our South, the deeper they sink into the quagmire of failure; as for us Vietnamese people, the more resolutely we fight, the greater the victories we achieve.

    The article then listed examples of the large-scale annihilation of American and puppet troops by the military and civilians of South Vietnam in the recent months after the United States massively increased its troops to South Vietnam in the battles of Van Tuong, Chu Lai, Da Nang, Duc Co, Bau Bang, Plei Me, Dong Duong, and many others, proving that the conclusion that no matter how many troops the American aggressors increase in the South, the enemy will ultimately be defeated and the Vietnamese people will ultimately win is completely correct. The article then exposed that while the US government is plotting new military adventures, it has also launched a large-scale "peace offensive" conspiracy, only to ease domestic and international opinion that is severely condemning their aggressive policy in Vietnam. The article said, "No matter how hard the US imperialists try to conceal their ambitions with beautiful words, they cannot deceive the Vietnamese people and the peace-loving people of the world. The fundamental conspiracy of US imperialism has never changed. They are still clinging to South Vietnam, attempting to divide the territory of Vietnam for a long time; they are still unwilling to withdraw their troops from the South, unwilling to recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the only true representative of the people of South Vietnam, and even openly believe that they have the right to bomb and strafe the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam - an independent and sovereign socialist country, and want the Vietnamese people to respond to their cessation of bombing of North Vietnam. The so-called 'unconditional discussions' are essentially forcing our people to accept the conditions of the American aggressor bandits."

      "No matter how many hundreds of thousands of expeditionary troops US imperialism sends to the South, no matter to what level they escalate the attacks on the North, we must further heighten our vigilance, vigorously promote the patriotic war of the whole people, and resolutely fight to the final victory. Our people will never retreat in the face of any major sacrifices in order to win the final victory in the great cause of resisting America to save the nation."

    The article said that we clearly know that we are fighting the most ferocious and brutal number one imperialist of our time, who is not only an irreconcilable enemy of our nation, but also the number one enemy of all nations, peace, democracy, and socialism in the world.

    We clearly know that our nation's battle is a battle full of hardships and sacrifices, but also full of glorious victories. This just cause conforms to the most sacred aspirations of our nation, and also conforms to the aspirations of the revolutionary people of the world.

    The article said, "Our nation has never so highly developed its indomitable fighting tradition and revolutionary heroism as it does today. The patriotic and socialist enthusiasm and hatred for the aggressors surging in the hearts of our people have never been so boiling as they are today. Our people's revolutionary cause has never been so supported and encouraged by all progressive mankind as it is today."

    The article said, "For the sake of independence and peace, for the sake of defending the North, liberating the South, and then unifying the motherland, and for the sake of making due contributions to the cause of the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world, the heroic Vietnamese people of both the North and the South must resolutely fight, fight to the end, and push the great cause of resisting America to save the nation to a glorious victory. The new type of war of aggression of US imperialism will definitely fail. Final victory will definitely belong to us."

    武元甲大将指出越南人民不受欺骗也不为美帝扩大战争所吓倒
    越南全国一心大力推进伟大爱国战争
    美国侵越战争基本弱点日益加深必将导致可耻失败
    新华社河内五日电　越南《学习》杂志一月号刊登武元甲大将写的一篇文章说，“约翰逊主义是美帝国主义最露骨、最贪婪和最阴险的新殖民主义侵略政策的集中表现。美帝国主义在新阶段进行的侵略战争将会更加激烈，同时它们的骗人伎俩也将更为狡猾。但是，我国人民决不会在它们的威胁面前动摇，也不会对它们假仁假义的论调抱有丝毫的模糊的看法。”
    这篇题为《全国一心，大力推进伟大的爱国战争，坚决战胜美国侵略强盗》的文章指出，美帝国主义的发展到最高阶段的“特种战争”战略已经根本上失败。正是由于这种失败和被动的局面，它采取新的战略来加紧推行战争，它大规模地向越南南方派遣了二十多万美军和仆从军，同时悍然对越南北方进行“逐步升级”的袭击，妄图扭转南越形势和在战略上夺取主动权。
    文章说，美帝国主义以大规模增派远征军到南越的行动，把侵略战争推向了一个新的阶段。这不是改换战争计划的一般的调兵，而是把侵略战争转向一个新的战略阶段的步骤。在美帝国主义把侵越战争推向一个新的阶段的严重形势下，文章详细分析了敌我双方的强处和弱点之后，得出了“最后敌人必败，我们必胜”的结论。文章指出，尽管美帝国主义是个国际宪兵，是帝国主义阵营中经济和军事潜力最大的头号帝国主义，它拥有一定限度的雄厚的物质力量，但是，它在军事和政治上甚至在战略和战术上都存在着最基本的弱点。从总的方面来看，世界上的力量对比，美帝国主义不是处在优势而是处在劣势，它还要分散力量，被动地应付各地区。美帝国主义派遣远征军直接侵略越南这个事就已带着无法克服的下列最基本弱点：
    第一，美帝国主义派军队直接侵略越南，它的侵略面目就更加暴露，它的走狗的卖国的面目也更加暴露无遗，从而使美帝国主义同我们民族的矛盾更加尖锐和激化。我国全体人民更加仇恨侵略强盗，更加广泛和紧密地团结在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的民族统一战线队伍中。所有各个爱国力量更加坚决战斗，保家卫国。许多在敌人暂时控制地区里的越南人，也逐渐看透了它们的侵略和卖国的真面目。
    第二，美帝国主义正是在它的“特种战争”战略根本上破产、我国人民的爱国战争正以十分蓬勃的气势发展、解放武装力量已经壮大、解放区已占南方人口和土地的大部分的时候，派军队侵略我国。因此尽管它增派几十万军队，也不能摆脱在战略上的被动局面。它不仅不能轻易地夺回主动权，相反，有可能越来越深陷失败的泥坑。
    第三，由于上述的政治上和军事上的被动，美国远征军的装备不管如何现代化，也不能发挥其战斗力，它必然被站起来坚决抵抗它的民族打败。由于这场战争是非正义的，美国远征军不知为何而战，他们的士气低落，加以它不熟悉地形、而供应和后勤又发生巨大的困难，因此无法对付一场人民战争。
    第四，美军越是直接进行侵略，伪军和伪政权的队伍就越被孤立和发生分化，美帝国主义同它的走狗之间的矛盾也越发展，在伪军和伪政权队伍中稍微有一点爱国心的人也日益觉悟起来，越来越多的人站到人民一边。因此，美帝国主义越是增加军队，不仅不能挽救伪军和伪政权的危困处境，相反，在我国人民抗战力量的打击下，伪军就会日益被歼灭和瓦解，伪政权也会日益崩溃。
    第五，美帝国主义在南方挑起战争，越来越受到世界爱好和平人民的强烈谴责。
    文章指出，“美帝国主义的优势是有限的，至于它的弱点则是基本的。在这场侵略战争的发展过程中，这些弱点将越来越暴露和加深，并且必然会导致美帝国主义的可耻失败。”
    文章接着说，“至于我们方面，我们是一个国土不广、人口不多的民族，但是正在团结起来坚决进行一场为保卫自己的生存、争取国家的独立与和平的爱国正义战争。面对着象美帝国主义这样的凶恶敌人，在激烈和长期的革命战争中，我们的力量不断发展，并多次迫使敌人遭到惨败。我们在装备、技术和经济力量方面存在着弱点的同时，我们拥有政治和精神方面的绝对优势，有着正确的领导路线，有着全民的团结力量，有着无敌的人民战争，并且还有着全世界人民的同情和大力支持。因而我们一定是越战越强、越战越胜。这就是在神圣的抗美救国解放战争中决定我国人民最后胜利的基本因素，尽管美帝国主义增加数十万远征军，它们也是改变不了最后必败、我们必胜的历史规律。”
    文章强调说，美帝国主义直接侵略我国，它的侵略面目就更加暴露，由它们挑起的这场战争的侵略和非正义的性质也就在全世界舆论面前赤裸裸地暴露出来。我国人民的爱国斗争的正义性更加光芒四射。文章说，美帝国主义的侵略是非正义的，我国人民是正义的，但最后是谁将战胜谁呢？我国人民将胜利还是美帝国主义将胜利？十一年来，美帝国主义每次实现新的侵略阴谋，这个问题都被提出来。英雄的南方人民的解放斗争历史，早已作出了有力的回答：尽管美帝国主义采取什么阴谋诡计，最后美帝国主义都必定被打败。我们南方同胞伟大的爱国斗争经历各个阶段的基本规律是：美帝国主义及其走狗越是推行奴役我国南方的阴谋，就越深深陷入失败的泥沼；至于我们越南人民，越是坚决斗争，就取得越大的胜利。
    文章接着列举最近几个月美国大量增兵到越南南方以后，越南南方军民在文相、朱莱、岘港、德古、保邦、波来梅、同阳和其他许多战役中大量歼灭美伪军的事例证明不管美国侵略者在南方增加多少兵力，最后敌人必败，越南人民必胜的结论是完全正确的。文章接着揭露，美国政府在策划新的军事冒险的同时，又发动了一场大规模的“和平攻势”的阴谋，只不过是为了缓和正在严厉谴责它们在越南的侵略政策的国内外舆论。文章说，“不管美帝国主义用尽漂亮的言词千方百计地来掩盖它们的野心，也是欺骗不了越南人民和世界爱好和平人民的。美帝国主义的基本阴谋从来没有改变。它们仍死赖在越南南方，企图长期分割越南国土；它们仍然不肯把军队撤出南方，不肯承认南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民的唯一真正的代表，甚至还公然认为它们有权轰炸和扫射越南民主共和国——一个享有独立和主权的社会主义国家的领土，要越南人民对它们停止轰炸越南北方给予响应。所谓‘无条件讨论’的论调，其实质是强迫我国人民接受美帝国主义侵略强盗的条件。”
      “无论美帝国主义增派几十万远征军到南方，无论它们把对北方的袭击升到那一级，我们都要进一步提高警惕，大力推进全民的爱国战争，坚决战斗到最后胜利。我国人民为了争取伟大的抗美救国事业的最后胜利，在任何重大的牺牲面前都决不后退。”
    文章说，我们清楚地知道，我们是正在同当代最凶恶、最残暴的头号帝国主义战斗，它不仅是我们民族不共戴天的敌人，也是世界上所有各民族，和平、民主和社会主义的头号敌人。
    我们清楚地知道，我们民族的战斗，是充满艰苦和牺牲的战斗，但也充满了光辉的胜利。这一正义的事业，符合我们民族最神圣的愿望，同时也符合世界革命人民的愿望。
    文章说，“我们民族从来没有象今天这样高度地发扬不屈的战斗传统和革命英雄主义。在我国人民心中涌起的爱国、爱社会主义热情，和对侵略者的仇恨，从来没有象今天这样沸腾。我国人民的革命事业也从来没有象今天这样得到全体进步人类的支持与鼓舞。”
    文章说，“为了独立与和平，为了保卫北方、解放南方、进而统一祖国，为了对全世界人民的革命斗争事业作出应有的贡献，英雄的越南南北两方人民一定要坚决战斗，战斗到底，把伟大的抗美救国事业推向光辉的胜利。美帝国主义的新型的侵略战争一定失败。最后胜利一定属于我们。”
