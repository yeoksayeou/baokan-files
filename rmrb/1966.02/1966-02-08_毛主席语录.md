    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    "Concerning the work of a person, a fundamental estimate must be made as to whether achievements are three parts and errors seven parts, or achievements are seven parts and errors three parts. If achievements are seven parts, then his work should be basically affirmed. It is completely wrong to describe achievements as primary as errors as primary."

    毛主席语录
    “一个人的工作，究竟是三分成绩七分错误，还是七分成绩三分错误，必须有个根本的估计。如果是七分成绩，那末就应该对他的工作基本上加以肯定。把成绩为主说成错误为主，那就完全错了。”
                                      《党委会的工作方法》
