    “Not Eating 馍 Chewed by Others”
    At the end of 1965, the Nong'an County Committee thoroughly reviewed the problems in leading agricultural production in recent years, identified shortcomings, and proposed to further highlight politics, study Chairman Mao's works extensively, and promote the revolutionary spirit in 1966 to fight a turnaround battle in agricultural production. Now, a high tide of agricultural production is developing throughout the county. The good example of Comrade Jiao Yulu has greatly encouraged us and strengthened our confidence. We firmly believe that by holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and following the path taken by Comrade Jiao Yulu, we can achieve victory. Recently, the county committee analyzed the natural conditions of Nong'an County and determined base points for various situations. I was assigned to the Fulongquan Commune in the western, sandy, drought-prone region. I will certainly be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, carrying my luggage and Chairman Mao's works, personally conduct investigations and research, conduct experiments with the masses, not eat 馍 chewed by others, gain experience, and contribute my strength to the county's turnaround in agricultural production.
          Zang Fenglin, Deputy Secretary of the Nong'an County Committee, Jilin

    “不吃别人嚼过的馍”
    我们农安县委在一九六五年末，比较彻底地检查了这几年在领导农业生产上的问题，找了差距，提出在一九六六年要进一步突出政治，大学毛主席著作，发扬革命精神，在农业生产上打一个翻身仗。现在全县农业生产高潮正在发展，又有了焦裕禄同志这样的好榜样，给了我们极大的鼓舞，更加坚定了我们的信心，坚信高举毛泽东思想红旗，走焦裕禄同志所走的道路，就能取得胜利。最近县委对农安县的自然条件进行了分析，确定了各类不同情况的基点，让我到西部风沙干旱的伏龙泉公社。我一定象焦裕禄同志那样，背上行李，带着毛主席著作，亲自调查研究，同群众一起作试验，不吃别人嚼过的馍，取得经验，为全县在农业生产上打个翻身仗贡献自己的力量。
