    Observing the Situation on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Line
    In a state-owned cotton mill in Shanghai, we visited a new machine created by the Chinese working class. This machine is a revolutionary new technology in the textile industry.
    The bright, nimble machine was operating normally with extremely high efficiency.
    Coincidentally, in the spring of 1958, we also visited this factory and saw this new technology. The difference is that it wasn't this machine, but another one, which was relatively crude and couldn't operate normally at the time, with many problems.
        In 1958, people dared to think and act, creating this new thing. As for its vitality, whether it could actually be used in production, it was still a question for many people at that time.
    Eight years have passed, and practice has answered people: the seedling has grown up, blossomed, and borne fruit. After many trials, reforms, re-trials, and re-reforms. Now, this new type of machine that can replace several processes is operating normally according to people's will. China's textile industry is opening up a path to leap forward on its own.
    At the small vertical kiln of the Zhenjiang Cement Plant, the machines roared. This is a small cement plant equipped with indigenous equipment, with a design capacity of 32,000 tons, and was established during the great development of 1958.
    In the first few years, it experienced difficulties and setbacks, to the point that it had to stop production at one point. However, by 1965, it had broken through the design level of 32,000 tons, and the quality reached 480 grade. Due to continuous technological innovations, it is planned to produce 55,000 tons of cement this year, with the quality reaching 500 grade, and costs will continue to decrease.
    In recent years, this small cement plant has played an increasingly important role in supporting agriculture. At the same time, it has also developed itself. Next to this small indigenous vertical kiln, a vertical kiln equipped with new mechanical equipment, with an annual output of 200,000 tons of cement, is under active construction.
    In the parking lot of the Nanjing Automobile Factory, we saw hundreds of Yuejin-brand cars, ready to be shipped. The name of the cars produced by this factory tells people that they also began to be manufactured in 1958.
    When this factory was first established, it had no "weapons." Many processes had to be done by hand. The small number of cars produced in the early years didn't even have a roof for the driver's cab.
    However, in 1966, the automobile production of this factory will have a large increase, and a new type of car that is both beautiful and sturdy has come off the assembly line.
    For some comrades, the city of Changzhou, which is not very familiar, will produce a large number of seven-horsepower tractors, machine tools, small internal combustion locomotives for traction, etc. this year. How did the machinery industry in this city of only over 200,000 people develop so quickly? If you ask this question, people will tell you: We started construction in 1958!
    On the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Line, as in many other places, wherever you go, you will hear the resounding era of 1958, this spirited and far-reaching era!
    People's understanding often does not develop linearly. It often has to go through a period of time and some twists and turns before it can reach a comprehensive and correct understanding. From 1966, looking back at 1958, many things and many problems become clearer: we are following a path of running industry according to Mao Zedong Thought, a path of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    This is an important turning point. In the past eight years, we have overcome various obstacles and advanced courageously, and have now achieved great victories. As we enter the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan, our industrial and transportation front is in an unprecedentedly prosperous scene. We are in a historical period of striving to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced levels.
    In our visit on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Line, we saw that the situation in 1966 is a situation in which revolutionary upsurges and production upsurges are advancing together.
    Under this unprecedentedly good situation, how should we better and more comprehensively implement the Party's general line for socialist construction? When the masses have great enthusiasm, how can various indicators be set more realistically? Many comrades we met during our visit said: The better the situation, the more calm our minds should be, the more we should study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, and better combine revolutionary enthusiasm with a scientific attitude, and be good at being cool-headed promoters.
    Mao Zedong Thought was born in struggle, and only in struggle can it be truly mastered. The comrades in Shanghai in charge of industrial production have a good understanding of this. They said: Implementing the principle of "quality first" and comprehensively implementing the idea of greater, faster, better, and more economical results proposed by Chairman Mao is often a struggle. They reviewed the first quarter of 1965, when there was a brief period when some enterprises experienced fluctuations in quality. Why did this happen? It was because some comrades relaxed ideologically. They were hot-headed and careless, "thinking" there was no problem, but problems occurred.
    Once they calmed down and their minds became clear, they immediately took measures, and the problem was quickly solved. Looking at the whole year of 1965, it was the year with the best quality in history. But from this, they gained an experience: in the increase production and practice economy movement, we must always adhere to the principle of "quality first," quality is paramount. Indicators must be realistic. They said that "good" and "stable" are unified. Stability in industrial production means adhering to the scientific spirit and insisting that everything be tested. With this, other problems can be easily solved.
    Shanghai has a Jiafeng Textile Factory. For eight years, no matter what the circumstances, they have maintained high standards of quality. What is their secret? There is none. What they have is the principle of "quality first" in their minds and meticulous and down-to-earth work. They grasp measures for each machine: measures to not increase yarn breakage, measures to not damage machines, and measures to not increase machine materials. In this way, the output of this factory has greatly increased, and the quality remains at a high level.
    The Nanjing Radio Factory will not only increase its output significantly this year, but also has higher quality requirements and more varieties. The comrades in this factory realize that it is not without difficulties to complete this task. How can we overcome difficulties and complete the task? First, rely on revolutionary spirit, and second, rely on a scientific attitude.
    In order to achieve this year's increase production and practice economy plan, this factory mobilized the masses to find more than a thousand difficult problems. Among them, there are 274 important items. These difficult problems must be dealt with with a strict scientific attitude. They must be eaten up one by one, like eating up the enemy. They organized three-way combination groups and went step by step to overcome these difficult problems, with good results.
    When we visited this factory, they had already solved 120 difficult problems, more than 60 items were in the middle of testing, and there were still more than 90 difficult problems that had not been solved. With the "enemy situation" clear, things are easier to handle. From here, we can draw a conclusion: potential is always there, and the problem is to develop human creativity and use a strict scientific attitude to overcome one difficult problem after another.
    Scientific analysis of things is also manifested in correctly treating the issue of conditions. Under certain material and technical conditions, the production potential has a certain limit. To continuously tap the potential, we must continuously create new conditions. The comrades of the Shanghai Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory fully understand this principle.
    This factory has a large task this year, many varieties, and it also has to catch up with the world's advanced levels. Relying solely on their existing "old" drawing equipment and chisels, hammers, and files for opening molds, it is difficult to greatly improve the level of production. They have now begun to plan to add more advanced extrusion presses. With this machine, the tube drawing speed will be greatly accelerated, the accuracy will be high, and it can also replace manual mold opening. Zhao Xixiang, the secretary of the branch, said to us: "If we can't get it from other places, we'll do it ourselves!" "If there are conditions, we will go ahead. If there are no conditions, we will create conditions and go ahead!" This fighting and scientific style of the Daqing people can also be seen everywhere on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Line.
    Carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, and catching up with the international advanced level, highlighting the word "surpass," is a class struggle on an international scale. What the Western bourgeoisie can do, the Eastern proletariat can certainly do, and must surpass it! This is politics, this is Mao Zedong Thought.
    But catching up with the world's advanced level is not enough to rely solely on revolutionary enthusiasm. Many comrades we met said: We must have a strict scientific spirit, have a plan, grasp models, arrange various tasks well, and have order. They are doing this now, and all walks of life are establishing models and fighting annihilation battles with focus and goals. A new upsurge in striving to catch up with the world's advanced level in science and technology is rising in Shanghai and other places.
    Mao Zedong Thought is being mastered by more and more people, experience is more comprehensive, enthusiasm is great, steps are steady, and order is good. This is the good situation of the increase production and practice economy movement seen by reporters in several cities on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Line. This good situation is a sign of the infinite power of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 沪宁线上看形势

    沪宁线上看形势
    在上海的一个国营棉纺厂中，我们参观了一台我国工人阶级独创的新机器。这台机器，是纺织工业中带有革命性的一项新技术。
    雪亮的、灵巧的机器，以极高的效率，正常地运转着。
    非常巧合，一九五八年的春天，我们也访问过这个工厂，也看过这项新技术。不同的是，不是这台机器，是另外一台，比较粗糙，当时还不能正常运转，问题还非常多。
        一九五八年，人们敢想敢干，创造了这个新事物。至于它的生命力如何，究竟能不能用到生产上去？那时候，对于许多人来说，都还是一个疑问。
    八年过去了，实践答复了人们：幼芽已经长大，开花，结果。经过了许多次试验，改革，再试验，再改革。现在，这台能代替好几道工序的新式机器，按照人们的意志正常运转了。我国的纺织工业，正在自己打开一条飞跃的门路。
    在镇江水泥厂的小立窑上，机器隆隆地响着。这是一个用土设备装备起来的、设计能力为三万二千吨的小水泥厂，是一九五八年大发展中创建的。
    开始几年，它经历了艰难曲折，以至于一度不得不停止生产。然而到了一九六五年，它突破了三万二千吨的设计水平，质量达到四百八十号。由于继续不断地进行了技术革新，今年计划生产五万五千吨水泥，质量要达到五百号，成本将继续降低。
    几年来，这个小小的水泥厂，在支援农业中发挥出越来越大的作用。同时，它自己也发展了，在这个小土立窑旁边，一个用新式机械装备起来的、年产二十万吨水泥的立窑，正在积极建设中。
    在南京汽车制造厂的停车场上，我们看到成百辆跃进牌汽车，整装待运。这个厂出产的汽车的名字，告诉人们，它也是在一九五八年开始制造的。
    这个厂开始创办时没有什么“武装”，许多工序，要靠手工敲敲打打。最初几年生产出的少量汽车，连驾驶室的棚子也没有。
    可是，一九六六年，这个工厂的汽车生产将有很大的增长，一种又漂亮又结实的新型号的汽车，已经从装配线上出来了。
    对于有些同志来说，还不大熟悉的常州市，今年将大批生产七马力的拖拉机、机床、牵引用的小型内燃机车等等。这个只有二十多万人的城市，机械工业怎么发展这样快呢？如果你提出这个问题，人们又会告诉你：我们是在一九五八年开始建设的！
    在沪宁线上，象在其它许多地方一样，走到那里，都会听到一九五八年这个响亮的年代，这个意气风发、影响深远的年代！
    人的认识常常不是直线发展的，常常要经过一段时间、一些曲折，才能到达全面、正确。从一九六六年，再回过头看一九五八年，许多事情，许多问题，就看得更加清楚了：我们走的是一条按照毛泽东思想办工业的道路，是一条鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的道路。
    这是一个重要的转折。八年来，我们排除各种阻碍，奋勇前进，现已取得了巨大胜利。当我们跨进第三个五年计划第一年的时候，我们的工业交通战线，是一片前所未有的兴旺景象。我们正处在一个努力争取赶上和超过世界先进水平的历史时期中。
    我们在沪宁线上的访问中看到，一九六六年的形势，是一个革命高潮和生产高潮并进的形势。
    在这种空前大好的形势下，应该怎样更好地全面贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线呢？在群众干劲很大的时候，各种指标怎样定得更加切合实际呢？我们在访问中接触到的许多同志都说：形势越好，头脑越要冷静，越要活学活用毛泽东思想，把革命干劲和科学态度更好地结合起来，当好冷静的促进派。
    毛泽东思想是在斗争中产生的，也只有在斗争中，才能真正学到手。上海主管工业生产的同志对这一点有很好的体会。他们说：实行好字当头，全面贯彻毛主席提出的多快好省的思想，就经常是一个斗争。他们回顾了一九六五年第一季度，曾经有一个短暂时期，有些企业，发生了质量波动的问题。为什么会发生这个情况？就是因为有些同志思想上放松了。热中无冷，“以为”没有问题，结果恰恰发生了问题。
    头脑一冷静下来，思想上一清醒过来，立刻采取措施，问题也就很快解决了。从一九六五年全年来看，是历年来质量最好的一年。但他们由此取得了一条经验：在增产节约运动中，一定要始终坚持好字当头，质量第一。指标要切合实际。他们说，好和稳是统一的。工业生产中的步子稳，就是坚持科学精神，坚持一切经过试验。有了这一条，别的问题就容易解决了。
    上海有个嘉丰纺织厂，八年来，不论在什么情况下，都保持质量的高标准。他们有什么秘诀？没有。他们有的就是思想上好字当头，工作上细致踏实。他们一台机器一台机器地抓措施：不增加断头的措施，不损坏机器的措施，不增加机物料的措施。这样，这个厂，产量大幅度提高了，质量仍然是高水平。
    南京无线电厂，今年不仅增产的数量大，而且质量的要求更高了，品种更多了。这个厂的同志们，认识到完成这个任务，不是没有困难的。怎样才能战胜困难，完成任务？一靠革命精神，二靠科学态度。
    这个厂为了实现今年的增产节约计划，发动群众找出一千多个难题。其中重要的有二百七十四项。这些难题是必须用严格的科学态度来对付的。是要象吃掉敌人一样，一个一个地吃掉的。他们组织了三结合小组，一步一个脚印地去攻破这些难题，收效很好。
    当我们访问这个工厂的时候，他们已经解决了一百二十项难题，有六十多项正在试验中间，尚有九十多项难题没有解决。“敌情”既明，事情也就好办了。从这里，可以得出一条经验：潜力是永远有的，问题是要发挥人的创造力，用严格的科学态度，去攻破一个一个难题。
    对事物进行科学分析，还表现在正确地对待条件的问题上。在一定的物质技术条件下，生产潜力是有一定限度的，要不断地挖潜力，就要不断地创造新的条件。上海永鑫无缝钢管厂的同志们，完全懂得这个道理。
    这个厂今年任务大，品种多，还要赶超世界先进水平。光靠他们现有的“老爷”拉拔设备和开模具用的凿子、鎯头、锉子，要想大幅度提高生产水平是困难的。他们现在已开始筹划增添比较先进的挤压机。有了这种机器，拉管速度大大加快，精确度高，还能代替手工开模具。支部书记赵熙祥同志对我们说：“如果别的地方弄不到，就自己动手干！”“有条件上，没有条件创造条件也要上！”大庆人的这种战斗的、科学的作风，在沪宁线上也处处可见。
    进行技术革新和技术革命，赶超国际先进水平，突出“超”字，这是国际范围的一场阶级斗争。西方资产阶级能办到的事，东方的无产阶级一定能办到，而且一定要超过它！这是政治，这是毛泽东思想。
    但是赶超世界先进水平，光凭革命热情是不够的。我们接触到的许多同志都说：一定要有严格的科学精神，要有规划，要抓样板，各项工作要安排得好，要有秩序。当前他们正是这样做的，各行各业，都有重点有目标地在树立样板，在打歼灭战。一个在科学技术方面力争赶超世界水平的新高潮，正在上海等地兴起中。
    毛泽东思想为越来越多的人掌握了，经验更加全面了，干劲大，步子稳，秩序好，这是记者在沪宁线上几个城市的访问中看到的增产节约运动的好形势。这个好形势，正是毛泽东思想威力无穷的标志。
