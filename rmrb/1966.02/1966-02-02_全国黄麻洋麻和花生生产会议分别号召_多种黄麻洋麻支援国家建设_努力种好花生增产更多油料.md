    Xinhua News Agency, 1st. Last year, China's jute and ambari hemp crops reaped a bumper harvest. The recent National Jute and Ambari Hemp Production Conference held in Beijing called on commune members in jute-growing areas to advance victoriously, continue to expand the planting area of fiber crops and increase the yield per unit area, and make new contributions to supporting the country's socialist construction.
    In 1965, China's jute and ambari hemp production enjoyed a bumper harvest. Old jute-growing areas such as Zhejiang, Guangdong, Fujian, and Jiangsu provinces, which had relatively high yields, achieved good harvests of jute and ambari hemp last year; jute-growing areas in provinces with previously lower yields, such as Jiangxi and Hunan, also began to move towards higher yields. Many provinces and regions have opened up new jute-growing areas. Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Shandong provinces have also made great achievements in increasing the planting of jute and ambari hemp by utilizing river and lake滩地sandbanks and low-lying areas. The average per-mu yield of jute planted on river and lake洲地islands in Hunan Province reached 550 jin. The average per-mu yield of jute planted in low-lying areas in the Yantai region of Shandong Province also reached about 300 jin. Many high-yield communes and teams have emerged in both new and old jute-growing areas.
    The conference summarized the experience of increased production of jute and ambari hemp last year, and believed that strengthening leadership in fiber crop production, carrying out the 比学赶帮超 (compare, learn, catch up, help) movement, and vigorously promoting advanced experience were important reasons for the increase in fiber crop production.
    The conference emphasized that jute and ambari hemp are important materials needed for China's socialist economic construction, but the current production volume of jute and ambari hemp cannot fully meet the needs of national construction. Therefore, vigorously increasing the production of jute and ambari hemp is a major and glorious task for the broad masses of rural people's commune members. The conference called on commune members in various places to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, plant jute for the revolution, plant jute with revolutionary spirit, expand the planting area of fiber crops according to local conditions, improve cultivation techniques, and increase the yield per unit area. The conference required all localities to take effective measures to quickly change the imbalance in yield per unit area and key issues for increased production such as degumming and retting techniques, and strive for a substantial increase in the production of jute and ambari hemp.

    Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The recently held National Peanut Production Conference called on the broad masses of commune members in peanut-producing areas to strive to increase the yield of peanuts per unit area, ensure the completion of the peanut planting plan, and increase the production of more oil for the country.
    Last year, China's peanut production achieved remarkable results, with both yield per unit area and total output increasing significantly compared to 1964. A number of high-yield units with large areas have emerged in various places, such as Taixing in Jiangsu, Yexian in Shandong, and Hong'an in Hubei, where the average peanut yield per mu reached more than 300 jin. Many communes, production brigades, and production teams in various places have average yields of 400 jin or 500 jin per mu. The conference pointed out that the increased production experience of these large-area, high-yield units has pointed out the path for further increasing peanut production in various places. As long as various places promote them according to local conditions and grasp various measures for increasing production, it is entirely possible to seize a greater harvest of peanuts in 1966.
    The conference required the main peanut-producing areas to continue to implement the oil and grain production policy of "taking grain as the key link, using grain to promote oil, using oil to promote grain, and achieving a double harvest of grain and oil," make overall plans, make rational arrangements, plant according to local conditions, make rational use of land, and properly arrange grain and oil production tasks, so that places suitable for planting peanuts should plant more peanuts. Production teams in scattered producing areas that have the conditions to grow peanuts should also grow some peanuts to meet the living needs of local commune members.
    The conference also required peanut-producing areas to strengthen specific leadership over peanut production, run peanut demonstration plots, use points to lead the area, and carry out a compare, learn, catch up, help, and exceed运动campaign to increase peanut production in a planned and led manner to promote a substantial increase in peanut production.

    全国黄麻洋麻和花生生产会议分别号召
    多种黄麻洋麻支援国家建设
    努力种好花生增产更多油料
    新华社一日讯　去年，我国黄麻、洋麻获得丰收。最近在北京举行的全国黄麻、洋麻生产会议，号召麻区社员，乘胜前进，继续扩大麻类种植面积和提高单位面积产量，为支援国家社会主义建设作出新的贡献。
    一九六五年我国黄麻、洋麻丰收。原来产量比较高的浙江、广东、福建、江苏等省的老麻区，去年黄麻、洋麻的生产获得较好收成；原来产量较低的江西、湖南等省麻区，也开始向高产前进。不少省区开辟了一些新麻区，湖南、湖北、安徽和山东等省，还利用江湖滩地和低洼地增种黄麻、洋麻，成就很大。湖南省在江湖洲地上种的黄麻，平均亩产达到五百五十斤。山东省烟台地区在低洼地上种的黄麻，平均亩产也达到三百斤左右。新老麻区都出现了许多高产社队。
    会议总结了去年黄麻、洋麻的增产经验，认为加强对麻类生产的领导，开展比学赶帮超运动，大力推广先进经验，是麻类作物增产的重要原因。
    会议强调指出，黄麻、洋麻是我国社会主义经济建设中所需要的一项重要物资，而目前黄麻、洋麻的生产数量还不能完全满足国家建设的需要。因此，大力增产黄麻、洋麻，是广大农村人民公社社员一项重大而光荣的任务。会议号召各地社员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为革命种麻，用革命精神种麻，因地制宜地扩大麻类种植面积，改进栽培技术，提高单位面积产量。会议要求各地采取有效措施，迅速改变单位面积产量不平衡和脱胶沤洗技术等增产关键问题，争取黄麻、洋麻的大幅度增产。
    新华社一日讯　最近召开的全国花生生产会议号召各花生产区的广大社员，努力提高花生的单位面积产量，保证完成花生种植计划，为国家增产更多的油料。
    去年我国花生生产取得显著成绩，单位面积产量和总产量，都比一九六四年有较多的增长。各地涌现了一批大面积高产的单位，如江苏的泰兴、山东的掖县、湖北的红安等县，花生平均亩产都达三百斤以上。各地还有不少公社、生产大队和生产队，平均亩产达到四百斤、五百斤。会议指出，这些大面积高产单位的增产经验，给各地进一步提高花生产量指出了途径。各地只要因地制宜地加以推广，抓好各项增产措施，夺取一九六六年花生的更大丰收是完全可能的。
    会议要求各花生主产区，继续贯彻执行“以粮为纲，以粮带油，以油促粮，粮油双丰收”的油粮生产方针，统筹兼顾，合理布局，因地种植，合理利用土地，妥善安排粮、油生产任务，使适宜种植花生的地方多种些花生。在分散产区的生产队，有条件种花生的，也要种些花生，以解决当地社员的生活需要。
    会议还要求各花生产区加强对花生生产的具体领导，办花生样板田，以点带面，有计划有领导地开展增产花生的比学赶帮超运动，促进花生大幅度增产。
