The guerrillas in Tan Uyen District alone engaged the enemy in more than ten battles in the one-month period from December 26 last year to January 26 this year, wiping out 173 enemy soldiers, including 156 U.S. soldiers killed or wounded. The guerrillas, in close coordination with the local people, have also repeatedly damaged and cut off highways, causing many difficulties for the enemy.
    In two counter-"sweeping" operations on January 24 and February 1, the guerrillas in the "D War Zone" of this province successively frustrated the attacks of the U.S. aggressor troops, wiping out more than 80 enemy soldiers, shooting down and damaging 7 enemy planes, and destroying 3 M-113 amphibious armored vehicles.

On February 6, guerrillas in Phuc Thang, Phuc An, and Phuc Hoa Communes of Tuy Phuoc District in this province defeated a "sweep" conducted by two puppet army companies and one Australian accomplice army company commanded by the U.S. aggressors, killing 62 enemy soldiers and wounding 17.
    Guerrillas in Vinh Long Province attacked the Li Hua Hotel, a place specially for U.S. bandits to seek pleasure in the suburbs of Vinh Long City, on the evening of February 5, killing 17 U.S. aggressors on the spot with mines and grenades, and wounding many more.
    The Dong Thap Muoi guerrillas attacked the Xunyang enemy stronghold in Binh Hiep Commune, Zhoucheng District, and the special forces training camp of the enemy in Thanh Phuoc Commune, Xuanren District, on January 28 and 29, respectively. In the battle to attack the Xunyang enemy stronghold alone, the guerrillas killed or wounded 60 enemy soldiers and captured a large number of weapons and military supplies.
    Guerrillas in Son Tinh District, Quang Ngai Province, have also recently defeated the enemy's "sweeps" of Shanxi, Ba Gia, Ba To and other communes, killing or wounding a total of 59 enemy soldiers.
    On February 6, guerrillas in Long Thanh Commune, Phung Hiep District, Can Tho Province, ambushed five enemy military vehicles on the highway from Soc Trang to Can Tho City, destroying two of them on the spot and killing or wounding seven enemy soldiers, including one puppet army officer who was killed on the spot.
    Guerrillas in Zhoucheng District, My Tho Province, recently shelled the headquarters of the 7th puppet army division, killing or wounding more than 20 enemy soldiers, including one puppet army lieutenant colonel and two puppet army captains who were killed.
    Saigon, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces exploded two powerful bombs outside the headquarters of the South Vietnamese puppet army near Tan Son Nhut Airport in the suburbs of Saigon at noon on the 17th. According to preliminary reports, about forty puppet army officers and soldiers were killed or wounded.
    Western news agencies reported that the explosion occurred at a back door of this South Vietnamese puppet army's "nerve center." At the time, many puppet army officers and soldiers were walking out of the door to have lunch.
