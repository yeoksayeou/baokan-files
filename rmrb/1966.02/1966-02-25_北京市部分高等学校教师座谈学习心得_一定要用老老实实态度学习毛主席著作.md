　　Beijing Higher Education Institutions Teachers' Symposium Learning Experience
　　Be Sure to Learn Chairman Mao's Writings with an Honest and Sincere Attitude
　　Their achievements in scientific research work are mainly the result of following Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Chairman Mao's philosophical thought. Their progress on the road of revolutionization and laborization is mainly the result of accepting Chairman Mao's teachings, transforming their thinking, and integrating with workers and peasants.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 24th -- The Political Department of the Ministry of Higher Education of the CPC recently held a symposium on the learning experiences of teachers from some higher education institutions in Beijing regarding the study of Chairman Mao's writings. The teachers who spoke at the meeting shared their gains from creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings from various perspectives. Their common understanding is that Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon for engaging in teaching reform, scientific research, and transforming the subjective world. In China's socialist higher education, we must raise the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher.
    At the conclusion of the symposium, the person in charge of the Ministry of Higher Education pointed out: Starting from the fundamental task of training successors to the proletarian revolution, the study of Chairman Mao's writings and the better application and mastery of Mao Zedong Thought by higher education institutions is of profound significance. This year, studying Chairman Mao's writings must become the primary task of higher education institutions. In learning, two integrations must be resolved: first, the integration of theory and practice, with practice being primary; and we must make great efforts in application; second, the integration of transforming the subjective world and transforming the objective world, with transforming the subjective world being primary. We must also resolve the issue of learning attitude, resolutely oppose dogmatism, and oppose the attitude of learning for show. We must learn with an honest and sincere attitude. Higher education institutions must catch up with the upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's writings nationwide and overcome the current state of backwardness.
    At the symposium, Xu Baosheng, professor of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute, Peng Bingpu, associate professor of the Thermodynamics Teaching and Research Group of the Department of Power Machinery at Tsinghua University, Gao Chongshou, deputy director of the Theoretical Physics Teaching and Research Office of the Department of Physics at Peking University, and others spoke about how, in recent years, their achievements in scientific research work were mainly the result of listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Mao Zedong Thought, and implementing Chairman Mao's philosophical thought in their research work. They said that after studying Chairman Mao's writings, they deeply realized that to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced science and technology levels, and to shorten the gap between us and advanced foreign science and technology, we must first liberate our minds, break down superstitions, and establish the thinking of daring to speak, daring to think, daring to struggle, and daring to win. When mental shackles are broken and thinking is liberated, revolutionary enthusiasm can be aroused. Xu Baosheng said that when he was researching a new metallurgical technology, he followed Chairman Mao's teachings, adhered to the spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, fought against various conservative ideas and foreign frameworks, and resolved to take his own path. In learning from foreign experience, he combined it with originality, with originality as the main focus, learning from others' strengths without blindly copying, boldly innovating, and daring to surpass them, resulting in the creation of new equipment that is more advanced in many aspects. They also personally realized that in scientific and technological research work, it is not enough to have the determination to catch up with and surpass advanced levels; we must also apply Chairman Mao's dialectical materialism for guidance. Peng Bingpu, associate professor of the Thermodynamics Teaching and Research Group of the Department of Power Machinery at Tsinghua University, said that when they were researching the transformation of ammonia synthesis towers, according to Chairman Mao's teachings in "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," they first conducted in-depth and arduous investigation and research work, analyzed the main contradictions in the technological transformation from the first-hand materials of the investigation, clarified the main attack direction, and then organized forces to break through. In the process of experimentation, as the work progressed, the main contradiction was constantly transforming, so they promptly summarized and analyzed, not being misled by superficial phenomena, recognizing the transformation of the contradiction, so that the work could proceed smoothly. Finally, they successfully transformed China's nitrogen fertilizer plant's old-fashioned 1940s ammonia synthesis tower, and the daily output exceeded the level of the new 1960s tower. Gao Chongshou, deputy director of the Theoretical Physics Teaching and Research Office of the Department of Physics at Peking University, also mentioned in his speech that in the past year, in the research of elementary particle theory, guided by "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," they had forged a research path with our own viewpoints and characteristics, with infinitely broad prospects. He said that the philosophical trend popular in Western physics circles is positivism, so research work is stagnating. We start from dialectical materialism and finally break through many difficulties that predecessors have not solved, and achieve some discoveries, inventions, creations, and advances.
    At the symposium, many teachers talked about the progress they had made on the road of revolutionization and laborization after studying Chairman Mao's writings. Li Lianjie, professor of the Department of Soil Chemistry at Beijing Agricultural University, and Li Hanru, professor of the Department of Design at Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College, combined production practice and scientific research, and spent a long time squatting in the countryside, implementing "three togethers" with poor and lower-middle peasants and agricultural machinery station workers. They gradually cultivated the class feelings of the working people in labor and clarified the question of who they should serve. In this way, teaching and scientific research had the correct direction. Li Lianjie said that he used to go to the countryside for production practice and scientific research, but he did not think about serving the poor and lower-middle peasants and serving production. He only thought about "scientific data" and the papers he wanted to write; the methods and purposes were not correct, so the theories he came up with were rarely directly applicable in production, and he could not make real achievements. After 1964, through studying Chairman Mao's writings, he changed his attitude and methods, put down the airs of experts and professors, honestly transformed his thinking, learned production knowledge and soil knowledge from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and solved key problems in production with them.
　　As a result, his thinking was transformed, and his work improved. He not only initially explored the water and fertilizer control technology related to soil improvement, farmland basic construction, and high-yield of major crops in the northern mountainous areas of Beijing, accumulated a large amount of scientific data, enriched the teaching content of soil science, and made high-yield models for the mountainous areas, but also gained inspiration from this, clarifying that the research of soil science should take its own path in China, breaking the various old frameworks and foreign dogmas in his mind. Li Hanru felt that the study of Chairman Mao's writings must be closely combined with the elimination of his own bourgeois ideology in order to truly learn it. He said that he used to engage in scientific research, which was divorced from production and the masses, and often limited to foreign literature and laboratories. He once spent a lot of time researching the "cutting theory," which had little to do with production, and wanted to make some personal achievements, but the results were not great. In recent years, he combined the study of Chairman Mao's writings and constantly examined and criticized his personal fame and gain thinking. At the same time, he changed the situation of engaging in scientific research divorced from reality and began to go into production, laboring with farmers for the revolution, and taking the countryside as the main scientific research position. He learned farming skills such as corn sowing, intertillage, and sweet potato ridging from farmers, and then designed seeders, ditch openers, intertillers, and ridging plows, which were welcomed by farmers when they were used in production. He said that when the direction is correct, the achievements made in one year will exceed the achievements of the past six or seven years. He said that he would be determined to go to the countryside for a long time, go to agricultural production, and carry out scientific research in combination with workers and peasants. Yong Shihe, deputy director and Party branch secretary of the Well Logging Teaching and Research Office of Beijing Petroleum Institute, introduced the situation of the teachers in their teaching and research office actively studying Chairman Mao's writings. The twenty-six teachers in this teaching and research office basically insisted on regular study and worked hard to transform their thinking. Twenty-four teachers participated in the Daqing Oilfield "Battle" in batches. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching that intellectuals must combine with workers and peasants, consciously worked with the Daqing workers, studied "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" together, solved problems in production, and took the Daqing workers as an example, learning their excellent qualities and establishing a revolutionary outlook on life. The twenty-four teachers who participated in the petroleum "Battle" had fifteen named as "Red Banner Bearers" of various levels in Daqing.
    Li Xiulin, a lecturer in the Department of Philosophy at Renmin University of China, and Liu Peitong, a professor in the Department of Geography at Beijing Normal University, respectively introduced their experiences in carrying out educational revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought at the symposium. In the past year or so, teachers and students of the Department of Philosophy at Renmin University of China have stepped out of the school and used society as a "factory" to try out part-work and part-study. They have transformed their thinking and transformed their learning in the large classroom of society and have achieved many results. The teachers have undergone great changes from their mental outlook to their work outlook, and the quality of teaching has also been significantly improved.

　　北京市部分高等学校教师座谈学习心得
　　一定要用老老实实态度学习毛主席著作
　　他们在科学研究工作中的成就，主要是按照毛泽东思想办事，贯彻了毛主席哲学思想的结果他们在革命化劳动化道路上的进步，主要是接受毛主席的教导，改造思想、同工农结合的结果
    新华社二十四日讯　中共高等教育部政治部最近举行了北京市部分高等学校教师学习毛主席著作心得座谈会，在会上发言的教师们从各种不同的角度畅谈了他们活学活用毛主席著作的收获。他们共同的体会是：毛泽东思想是从事教学改革、科学研究和改造主观世界的强有力的武器。在我国社会主义的高等教育事业中，必须更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗。
    高等教育部负责人在座谈会结束时指出：高等学校从担负培养无产阶级革命接班人这一基本任务出发，学习毛主席著作，更好地运用和掌握毛泽东思想，其意义十分深远。今年，学习毛主席著作，要成为高等学校的首要任务。在学习中，要解决两个结合：一是理论和实践结合，而第一位的是实践，要在用字上狠下功夫；二是改造主观世界和改造客观世界结合，而第一位的是改造主观世界。还要解决一个学习态度问题，要坚决反对教条主义，反对为装潢门面而学习的态度。一定要以老老实实的态度学习。高等学校在全国学习毛主席著作的高潮中，一定要赶上去，克服目前的落后状态。
    座谈会上，北京钢铁学院机械系教授徐宝升、清华大学动力机械系热工学教研组副教授彭秉璞、北京大学物理系理论物理教研室副主任高崇寿等在发言中谈到：近几年来，他们在科学研究工作中做出了一些成就，主要是听毛主席的话，按毛泽东思想办事，在研究工作中贯彻了毛主席的哲学思想的结果。他们说，在学习毛主席著作以后，使他们深深体会到：要赶上和超过世界先进的科学技术水平，要缩短我们和国外先进科学技术的差距，首先要解放思想，破除迷信，树立起敢说敢想、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的思想。精神枷锁打碎了，思想解放了，革命劲头就能鼓起来。徐宝升说，他在研究一种新的冶金技术时，遵循毛主席的教导，坚持自力更生、奋发图强的精神，和各种保守思想与洋框框作斗争，下决心走自己的道路；在学习外国经验时与独创精神相结合，以独创为主，既学人家的长处，又不盲目抄袭，放手革新，敢于超过他们，结果创造出了在许多方面都比较先进的新设备。他们还切身体会到：在科学技术研究工作中，光有赶超先进水平的决心还不够，还必须应用毛主席的辩证唯物主义思想作指导。清华大学动力机械系热工学教研组副教授彭秉璞说，他们研究改造氨合成塔的工作时，根据毛主席的《实践论》《矛盾论》的教导，首先作深入、艰苦的调查研究工作，从调查的第一手材料中分析技术改造中的主要矛盾，明确主攻方向，然后再组织兵力加以突破。在试验过程中，随着工作的进展，主要矛盾在不断转化，他们就及时地总结分析，不为表面现象所迷惑，认清矛盾的转化，使工作能够顺利进行。最后终于使我国氮肥厂现在的四十年代老式氨合成塔改造成功，日产量超过了六十年代新塔的水平。北京大学物理系理论物理教研室副主任高崇寿在发言中也谈到，一年来，他们在基本粒子理论的研究中，以《实践论》《矛盾论》为指导，闯出了一条有我们自己的观点和特色的、有无限广阔天地的研究道路。他说，在西方物理学界流行的哲学思潮是实证主义，因此研究工作停滞不前。我们从辩证唯物主义出发，终于突破许多前人没有解决的难关，做到了有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。
    座谈会上，不少教师谈到了学习毛主席著作以后，在革命化、劳动化的道路上所取得的进步。北京农业大学土壤化学系教授李连捷和北京农业机械化学院设计系教授李翰如结合生产实习和科学研究，都曾用较长时间到农村去蹲点，和贫农下中农、农机站工人实行“三同”，在劳动中逐渐培养起劳动人民的阶级感情，明确了应该为谁服务的问题，这样，教学和科学研究就有了正确的方向。李连捷说，他过去也下乡搞生产实习和进行科学研究，但没有想到要为贫农下中农服务，为生产服务，想到的只是“科学资料”和自己要写的论文；方法和目的都不对头，所以搞出来的理论，很少能直接在生产中应用，做不出真正的成绩来。一九六四年以后，通过学习毛主席著作，改变了态度和方法，放下专家教授的架子，老老实实地改造思想，向贫农下中农学习生产知识和土壤知识，和他们一起解决生产中的关键问题。
　　这样做的结果，思想得到改造，工作也有了起色，不仅初步摸索到有关北京北部山区土壤改良、农田基本建设和主要作物丰产的水肥控制技术，积累了大量的科学资料，丰富了土壤学教学内容，为山区做出了高产样板，而且由此得到启发，明确了土壤学的研究应该走中国自己的道路，打破了原来脑子里形形色色的旧框框和洋教条。李翰如感到，学习毛主席著作必须与清除自己的资产阶级思想紧密地结合起来，才能真正学得进去。他说，他过去搞科学研究，既脱离生产，又脱离群众，经常局限于外国文献和实验室中，曾经在和生产关系不大的“切割理论”的研究方面耗费了不少时间，想搞出一些个人成就，结果成绩不大。近年来，他结合学习毛主席著作，不断检查和批判了自己的个人名利思想，同时改变了脱离实际搞科学研究的状况，开始到生产中去，和农民一起劳动，为革命而研究，把农村作为主要的科学研究阵地。他向农民学习玉米播种、中耕和甘薯起垄等农活，从而设计出了排种机、开沟器、中耕机和起垄犁，一用到生产上去，就受到农民的欢迎。他说，方向对头了，一年的时间所做出的成绩就超过以往六七年的成绩。他表示要下决心长期到农村去，到农业生产中去，和工人农民结合开展科学研究。北京石油学院测井教研室副主任、党支部书记雍世和介绍了他们教研室教师积极学习毛主席著作的情况。这个教研室二十六名教师基本上都能坚持经常学习，努力改造思想，有二十四名教师分批参加了大庆石油“会战”，他们遵循毛主席的知识分子必须与工农结合的教导，自觉地同大庆工人一起劳动，一起学习《实践论》、《矛盾论》，解决生产中的问题，并且以大庆工人为榜样，学习他们的优秀品质，树立革命的人生观，思想上进步较快。参加石油“会战”的二十四名教师中有十五名在大庆被评为各级的“红旗手”。
    中国人民大学哲学系讲师李秀林和北京师范大学地理系教授刘培桐，在座谈会上分别介绍了他们以毛主席思想为指导进行教育革命的体会。一年多来，中国人民大学哲学系师生走出校门，以社会为“工厂”试行半工半读，在社会大课堂里改造思想，改造学习，取得不少成绩，教师们从精神面貌到工作面貌都起了较大的变化，教学质量也有了显著提高。
