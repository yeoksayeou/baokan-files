    People Change Thinking, Factory Changes Appearance
    --Remembering the Tremendous Changes in the Liaoyuan Power Plant
    Editor's Note: The Liaoyuan Power Plant has undergone earth-shaking changes: the dilapidated old equipment has become some of the best in its class nationwide, and the high coal consumption has become the lowest in its class nationwide. Where did this great change come from? Because the Liaoyuan Power Plant formed a team of workers who were revolutionized in their thinking. "People change their thinking, and the factory changes its appearance." Without a great change in the mental outlook of the people, there would be no great change in the overall production outlook of the factory.
    The key to the Liaoyuan Power Plant's ability to form such a team of workers with revolutionary thinking lies in the fact that the plant's leadership core has consistently conducted class education for the workers for more than ten years, and the key lies in the fact that the plant's leadership core has firmly grasped the key of class struggle in daily work, production, and life.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Grasping ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to carry out great political struggles. If this task is not resolved, all the Party's political tasks cannot be completed." To complete the fundamental political tasks of socialist revolution and socialist construction, to complete the fundamental political tasks of the three great revolutions of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experimentation, it is impossible without first "grasping ideological education" as the "central link."
    What is "ideological education"? It is the struggle to overcome all kinds of non-proletarian thoughts with proletarian thought, that is, the Liaoyuan Power Plant's constant "timely grasp of various practical examples to carry out the struggle between two kinds of thinking and two roads," in short, it is class struggle.
    As long as we "grasp ideological education" as the "central link" like the Liaoyuan Power Plant, we will highlight politics, truly put politics in the commanding position, truly penetrate politics into business, and truly thread the key of class struggle like a red line through all work.
    To learn from the Liaoyuan Power Plant, we should learn its methods and art of "grasping ideological education."
    The Liaoyuan Power Plant, hailed as the "Daqing of the electricity industry," has undergone earth-shaking changes in the past ten years or so under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought: the dilapidated equipment from the 1930s has been transformed by the workers into better equipment among the same type of power plants nationwide, and has created a national safe power generation record of 1,758 days, with 85% of the plant's work groups operating safely for more than 3,000 days; the original coal consumption of 700-800 grams per kilowatt-hour has been reduced to 492 grams, which is the lowest coal consumption among the same type of power plants nationwide; the set of old frameworks and foreign frameworks in enterprise management that originally restricted the workers' enthusiasm for production and the development of production have been broken by the workers, and replaced by a new set of management systems that adhere to putting politics in command and rely on the masses to run enterprises.
    The fundamental reason for all these changes is that the Liaoyuan Power Plant has a team of workers who are revolutionized in their thinking and technically proficient, who are not afraid of hardship, do not seek fame or fortune, and are wholeheartedly dedicated to revolution. The growth of this team of workers is the result of the factory leadership's repeated and continuous class education according to Chairman Mao's teachings.
        Class Education Runs Through All Work
    In the Liaoyuan Power Plant, class education is like a red line that runs through all work. For more than ten years, they have not only grasped relatively concentrated, large-scale class education, but also frequently grasped the workers' living thoughts in production, work, and life to carry out class education.
    The Liaoyuan Power Plant was established in 1921 and experienced the old China, the puppet Manchuria, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Its factory history is a history of blood and tears of the working class, and also a history of the working class's resistance to oppression and exploitation. The factory Party committee pays great attention to educating the workers with the factory history. Whenever a new batch of workers enters the factory, they first enter the training class to receive class education. Plant-wide class education activities are held at least once or several times a year, and have continued to this day.
    For example, since 1960, the factory has conducted three large-scale class education sessions for the workers. They organized old workers to recall the bitterness and think about the sweetness, comparing the new and old societies; organized workers to pay homage to the "Wanrenkeng" (Ten Thousand People Pit), where Japanese imperialists brutally murdered Chinese miners during the puppet Manchuria period; and invited veteran Red Army soldiers and local military leaders to give reports. These three large-scale class education sessions enabled the vast number of workers to withstand the impact of bourgeois ideology and withstand the test of difficulties. "The more difficult, the straighter the backbone," the attendance rate of all workers in the plant remained above 96%, political and cultural studies were never interrupted, and labor competitions were in full swing. It was also during this period that the workers created excellent safety records, the coal consumption per kilowatt-hour was reduced to below 500 grams, and many major technological innovations were achieved.
    While carrying out concentrated class education, the Liaoyuan Power Plant also promptly seized various practical examples to carry out the struggle between two kinds of thinking and two roads, and conducted regular class education for the workers. In 1963, a stoker of Boiler No. 6 caused a "boiler water reduction obstacle" due to lack of concentration. The foreman of this shift fabricated a set of false circumstances to shift the responsibility to another branch plant. The factory Party committee believed that this was a reflection of bourgeois individualism, so it organized an investigation, clarified the truth, helped the foreman realize his mistake, and conducted a self-criticism at the mass meeting. The factory Party committee seized this opportunity to launch a struggle throughout the plant to tell the truth, be honest people, and oppose fraud, and also established typical figures of loyalty and honesty from the positive side, improved the understanding of the struggle between two kinds of thinking, and vigorously promoted the development of production.
    Long-term class education has enabled the workers of the Liaoyuan Power Plant to understand what exploitation is and what revolution is. In recent years, they have also studied Chairman Mao's works with deep class feelings, and their class consciousness has been further improved. They consciously link their daily labor with the proletarian revolutionary cause, and establish the revolutionary outlook on life of "generating electricity for the revolution" and "the work post is a revolutionary post."
    Safe Power Generation Year After Day
    The thought of "generating electricity for the revolution" of the workers of the Liaoyuan Power Plant is first manifested in their high degree of political responsibility for safe power generation, day after day. They said that whether power generation is safe or not is not just our business, but a major event related to socialist construction and world revolution.
    Once, the transmission line of Coal Mine No. 1 was under maintenance. Only ten minutes were left before the power transmission time, and the withstand voltage test had not yet been done. At that time, some people were worried that the test would not be able to transmit power on time, which would be counted as an accident, which would interrupt the safe power generation record, and suggested not to test, just check it once and contact the power transmission. The factory's chief engineer disagreed with this opinion. He said: "We have to do the test even if it is counted as an accident. If we don't test it, the equipment is unreliable, and if something goes wrong during operation, the loss to the country will be even greater." Everyone felt that it made sense, and they all took action and joined the tense battle. As a result, the test was done and the power was transmitted on time.
    The factory's regulations on obstacle (accident seedling) rules and statistical methods are very strict. In the early stage of implementation, the number of obstacles in production was relatively large. Once, at the evaluation meeting of the Jilin Provincial Electric Power Administration, the Liaoyuan Power Plant was praised for no accidents, but was criticized for too many obstacles. After the meeting, some people in the factory complained that it was not worthwhile to report the obstacles. The factory Party committee believes that obstacles are objectively existing, and they exist whether you report them or not. If obstacles are not reported, it is only a false name on the surface, but in fact it can only paralyze yourself, relax your vigilance, and get real misfortune. Concealing small mistakes will conceal big mistakes. When it comes to the revolutionary cause, you must never "open the back door" for yourself. The factory Party committee decided to continue to report obstacles. Soon, the factory mobilized the masses to take active preventive measures, and the obstacles dropped sharply.
    On May 14 last year, an accident occurred with a transformer, interrupting the safe power generation record that had been maintained for nearly five years. At that time, some people were greatly shaken ideologically, saying: This time the five-good enterprise is finished. Some people even complained about the transformer manufacturing factory. However, the vast majority of cadres and workers were not intimidated by this sudden event. After the accident, the factory leadership organized all the workers in the plant to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teaching in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" on "Can bad things be turned into good things?" and launched a discussion. The workers said: It is not terrible to have accidents, what is terrible is to fall down in the face of accidents. If you fall, get up and create new achievements to report to the Party. Then, the plant launched a "four check" activity to check safety thinking, check equipment, check basic skills, and check seasonal accident prevention, and dug out some hidden equipment dangers. As a result, a new record of 112 days without obstacles was created.
    Highlighting politics in safe production, penetrating ideological and political work into every link of safe production, and dealing with safe production issues with a dialectical point of view is the fundamental experience of the Liaoyuan Power Plant's long-term safe power generation.
    Dare to Practice, Reform Old Equipment
    The thought of "generating electricity for the revolution" of the workers of the Liaoyuan Power Plant is also manifested in their courage to break the framework and boldly innovate the factory's old equipment. Over the past ten years, the factory has completed more than 200 major technological innovation projects, making the equipment of the 1930s exceed the design level and reach the most advanced level of similar equipment in China. In the process of innovation, the factory widely organizes the combination of workers, cadres, and technicians, adheres to everything through experiments, and adheres to the combination of revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude.
    The cation and anion exchange method of chemical water treatment is a new technology. The Liaoyuan Power Plant needs to adopt this new technology very much because of insufficient water source and poor water quality. Li Changrong, who is in charge of water treatment in the factory, together with the laboratory staff, with the assistance of factory leaders and technicians from relevant units, actively carried out experiments since 1958. Li Changrong had only studied in junior high school in the past, but he and his companions repeatedly studied articles such as "On Practice" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," saying that "what foreign countries have, we must have, and what others don't have, we must also create." In the process of the experiment, they made their own equipment without ion exchange agents and equipment. The equipment was not resistant to corrosion, so they sought teachers and asked for skills everywhere, and found a way to resist corrosion. The experiment was carried out for four years and experienced hundreds of failures. This new technology was put into trial production in 1962. At that time, because this new technology still had the shortcomings of low output and fast failure, it was not overcome after several transformations. As a result, some people came out to criticize and say: It's just spending money on experiments, it's simply a spendthrift.
    However, the workers in charge of this experiment did not lose heart. They repeatedly studied "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and Premier Zhou's government work report at the First Session of the Third National People's Congress, carefully summarized past experiences and lessons, and further improved their confidence. Then, they continued to experiment. After more than 20 days of experimentation, summarization, and re-experimentation, the experiment was finally successful. After this technology was applied in production, the boiler sewage discharge rate decreased by 57%, the steam salt content decreased by 70%, and 500 tons of coal can be saved every year. But more importantly, this innovation broadened people's thinking and made them further realize that as long as they dare to practice and are good at practice, technical problems can be solved.
    At present, the factory's several old boilers from the 1930s have been caught up with the advanced level in China after years of continuous reform by the workers. Operations such as coal unloading, coal transportation, and ash removal in the factory have now basically achieved full mechanization.
    The Key Lies in Having a Revolutionary Team
    The key to the Liaoyuan Power Plant's continuous revolution and continuous progress over the past ten years lies in having a good leadership team that has brought out a team of workers who are ideologically and technically competent.
    Most of the leading cadres in this factory are from working-class backgrounds and maintain the true colors of the working people. Especially since 1958, they have become more determined in their revolutionary world outlook by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. They listen to the Party, mingle with the masses, say less and do more, and put the word "dry" first; they have the ambition to strive for progress and a pragmatic style; they are simple and hardworking in work and life, and set an example everywhere.
    Since 1957, they have often gone to the work groups, to the most difficult places, and to the places with many problems to work. When the factory proposed "breaking the 500 grams mark for power generation coal consumption" in 1961, the boiler was mixing coal gangue. Because this kind of gangue often extinguished the fire, the Party Secretary, the factory director, and the chief engineer divided into three fronts to work with the workers, and jointly studied methods through labor and solved the problem of mixing coal gangue smoothly.
    Going deep into reality and contacting the masses is a good tradition of the factory's leading cadres. There was a period when some young workers had opinions about the dormitory, and the Party Secretary Geng Delin moved into the collective dormitory and lived with them. A few days later, he found that there were both the actual problem of the cold room and the ideological problem of fear of hardship. He mobilized the masses to work together to increase heating equipment; at the same time, he repeatedly carried out education on revolutionary traditions and comparison between the new and old societies for the workers. Therefore, both the practical problems and the ideological problems were solved.
    The factory's leading cadres share weal and woe with the masses in life and live in the same houses as the workers. After the renovation of the old factory buildings in 1965, the dormitory problem of 29 households of workers can be solved. At that time, the factory leaders decided: first, the leading cadres should not; second, they should educate the workers to seize the difficulties and give way to convenience, and distribute them to the people who need them most. The workers said that the leading comrades are so simple and hardworking, we should learn from them.
    The style of the factory's leading cadres has driven the whole factory to form a good atmosphere of diligence and thrift. The coal consumption per kilowatt-hour of this factory has dropped from 760 grams in 1949 to 492 grams in 1965. If calculated according to the coal consumption level in 1949, nearly one million tons of coal have been saved for the country in the past 16 years. (According to the Xinhua News Agency draft)

    人换思想厂变样
    ——记辽源发电厂翻天覆地的变化
    编者按　辽源发电厂发生了翻天覆地的变化：千疮百孔的旧设备变成了全国同类企业中较好的设备，较多的煤耗变成了全国同类企业中最少的煤耗。这种大变化从何而来呢？因为辽源发电厂组成了一支思想革命化的职工队伍。“人变思想厂变容”，没有人的思想面貌的大变化，不会有全厂生产面貌的大变化。
    辽源发电厂能够组成这样一支思想革命化的职工队伍，关键在于这个厂的领导核心十几年如一日地对职工坚持阶级教育，关键在于这个厂的领导核心在日常工作、生产和生活中紧紧抓住了阶级斗争这条纲。
    毛泽东同志说过：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”我们要完成社会主义革命和社会主义建设这样根本的政治任务，要完成阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命这样根本的政治任务，不首先“掌握思想教育”这个“中心环节”是不行的。
    什么是“思想教育”？就是用无产阶级思想克服各种非无产阶级思想的斗争，也就是辽源发电厂不断进行的“及时抓住各种实际事例，开展两种思想、两条道路的斗争”，简言之，就是阶级斗争。
    只要象辽源发电厂这样紧紧“掌握思想教育”这个“中心环节”，就是突出了政治，就把政治真正摆到了统帅的地位，就能真正把政治渗透到业务中去，就能把阶级斗争这条纲真正象红线似的贯串到一切工作之中。
    学习辽源发电厂，就应该学习它“掌握思想教育”的方法和艺术。
    被誉为“电业部门的‘大庆’”的辽源发电厂，十几年来在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，发生了翻天覆地的变化：原来那些千疮百孔的三十年代的旧设备，已被职工们改造成为全国同类型电厂中比较好的设备，并创造过一千七百五十八天的全国安全发电纪录，全厂百分之八十五的班组安全运行在三千天以上；原来每发一度电要耗煤七八百克，现在已降低到四百九十二克，这是全国同类型电厂中耗煤最少的；原来束缚职工生产积极性、束缚生产发展的企业管理上的一套旧框框、洋框框，已被职工们所打破，代之以一套新的坚持政治挂帅、坚持依靠群众办企业的管理制度。
    发生这一切变化的根本原因，在于辽源发电厂有一支思想革命化、技术过硬的职工队伍，他们不怕艰苦，不为名利，一心一意干革命。而这一支职工队伍的成长，是工厂领导根据毛主席的教导，反复不断地进行阶级教育的结果。
        阶级教育贯串在各项工作之中
    在辽源发电厂，阶级教育就象一条红线，贯串在各项工作之中。十几年来，他们既抓比较集中的、大型的阶级教育，又经常抓职工在生产、工作和生活中的活思想，进行阶级教育。
    辽源发电厂开办于一九二一年，经历了旧中国、伪满和国民党反动统治时期，它的厂史是一部工人阶级的血泪史，也是工人阶级反抗压迫剥削的斗争史。工厂党委很注意用厂史教育职工，每当一批新工人入厂，都先入训练班，受阶级教育。全厂性的阶级教育活动每年至少抓一次至几次，一直持续到现在。
    比如，从一九六○年起工厂对职工先后进行过三次大型的阶级教育。组织老工人忆苦思甜，对比新旧社会；组织职工凭吊在伪满时期日本帝国主义者惨杀中国矿工的地方——“万人坑”；请老红军和当地驻军首长作报告。这三次大型的阶级教育，使广大职工顶住了资产阶级思想的冲击，经住了困难的考验，“愈困难，腰板愈硬”，全厂职工出勤率保持在百分之九十六以上，政治、文化学习从未间断，劳动竞赛搞得热火朝天。也正是在这一个时期，职工们创造了优异的安全纪录，每度电的煤耗降低到了五百克以下，并且实现了很多重大的技术革新。
    在进行集中的阶级教育的同时，辽源发电厂还及时抓住各种实际事例，开展两种思想、两条道路的斗争，对职工进行经常性的阶级教育。一九六三年有一次，六号炉司炉由于精神不集中，造成一次“锅炉减水障碍”。这个班的班长编了一套假情况，把责任转嫁给别的分场。厂党委认为，这是资产阶级个人主义思想的一种反映，就组织调查，弄清了真相，帮助这个班长认识了错误，在群众大会上进行了检查。工厂党委抓住这个时机，在全厂开展了一次说老实话、当老实人、反对弄虚作假的斗争，又从正面树立了忠诚老实的典型人物，提高了对两种思想斗争的认识，有力地促进了生产的发展。
    长期的阶级教育，使辽源发电厂的职工懂得了什么是剥削，什么是革命。近几年来，他们又带着浓厚的阶级感情学习毛主席著作，阶级觉悟进一步提高了，他们自觉地把日常劳动与无产阶级的革命事业联系在一起，树立起“为革命而发电”，“工作岗位就是革命岗位”的革命人生观。
    安全发电常年如一日
    辽源发电厂职工“为革命而发电”的思想，首先表现在他们对安全发电抱着常年如一日地高度的政治责任感上。他们说，发电安全不安全，不只是我们的事，而是关系到社会主义建设和世界革命的大事。
    有一次，一号煤矿输电线检修。离送电时间只剩十分钟了，耐压试验还没做。当时，有人担心做试验不能按时送电，要算一次事故，这样就会打断安全发电纪录，建议不试验，只检查一遍就联系送电。工厂总工程师不同意这种意见，他说：“算事故也得做试验。假如不试验，设备不可靠，运行中出了事，那对国家的损失就更大了。”大家一听有道理，都纷纷行动起来，投入紧张的战斗。结果既做了试验，也按时送了电。
    这个工厂规定的障碍（事故苗子）细则和统计办法十分严格，执行初期，生产中出现的障碍次数比较多。有一次，在吉林省电业管理局的评比会上，辽源发电厂无事故受到表扬，但因障碍多受到批评。会后，厂内有人埋怨出了障碍就报，划不来。厂党委认为障碍是客观存在，你报它存在，不报它也存在。障碍不上报，表面上图了虚名，实际上只能是麻痹自己，放松警惕，得了实祸。隐瞒了小错，就会隐瞒大错。对待革命事业，决不能给自己“开后门”。厂党委决定继续报障碍。不久，工厂发动群众采取积极的预防措施，障碍大幅度下降了。
    去年五月十四日，有一台变压器发生事故，中断了保持近五年的安全发电纪录。当时有的人思想震动很大，说：这下子五好企业完了。有的人还抱怨变压器制造工厂。但是绝大多数干部和职工没有被这突然事件吓倒。事故发生后，工厂领导组织全厂职工反复学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》一文中“坏事能否变成好事？”的教导，并展开了讨论。工人们说：出事故不可怕，可怕的是在事故面前倒下去。跌倒了，爬起来，再创新成绩向党汇报。接着，全厂开展了查安全思想、查设备、查基本功、查季节性事故预防的“四查”活动，挖出了一些设备隐患。结果创造了一百一十二天无障碍的新纪录。
    在安全生产上突出政治，把思想政治工作渗透到安全生产的每一个环节上去，用辩证的观点处理安全生产问题，这就是辽源发电厂长期安全发电的根本经验。
    勇于实践，改革老旧设备
    辽源发电厂职工“为革命而发电”的思想，还表现在他们敢于打破框框，大胆革新工厂的老设备。十多年来，这个工厂已经完成了二百多个较大的技术革新项目，使三十年代的设备超过了设计水平，达到了国内同型设备中最先进的水平。这个厂在革新过程中广泛组织工人、干部和技术人员三结合，坚持一切经过试验，坚持革命精神和科学态度相结合。
    化学水处理的阴阳离子交换法，是一项新技术。辽源发电厂因水源不足，水质不好，很需要采用这项新技术。厂内负责水处理工作的李长荣，同化验员一起，从一九五八年起，在厂领导和有关单位技术人员的协助下，积极开展了试验。李长荣过去只念过高小，但是他和同伴们反复学习了《实践论》、《愚公移山》等文章，表示“国外有的，我们一定要有，别人没有的，我们也要创。”在试验过程中，没有离子交换剂，没有设备，他们自己制造。设备不耐腐蚀，他们到处寻师求艺，找到了耐腐蚀的办法。试验一直进行了四年，经历了上百次失败，这项新技术在一九六二年投入了试生产。当时，因为这项新技术还存在着出力低、失效快的缺点，几经改造，也没有克服。于是，就有人出来指责说：净花钱做试验，简直是败家子。
    但是，负责这项试验工作的职工，并没有灰心。他们反复学习了《实践论》、《矛盾论》和周总理在第三届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告，认真总结了过去的经验教训，进一步提高了信心。接着，他们继续进行试验。经过二十多天的试验、总结、再试验，终于试验成功了。这项技术在生产上应用后，锅炉排污率下降了百分之五十七，蒸汽含盐量下降了百分之七十，每年还可以节省煤炭五百吨。但更重要的是，这项革新，开阔了人们的思想，使他们进一步认识到，只要勇于实践，善于实践，技术难题是可以解决的。
    目前，这个工厂的几台三十年代的老锅炉，职工们经过多年连续改革，赶上了国内先进水平。厂内卸煤、输煤、除灰等操作，现在已基本上实现了全盘机械化。
    关键在于有一支革命化的队伍
    辽源发电厂十几年来不断革命，不断前进，关键在于有一个好的领导班子，带出了一支思想过硬、技术过硬的职工队伍。
    这个厂的领导干部多数是工人出身，保持着劳动人民的本色。特别是从一九五八年以来，他们通过活学活用毛主席著作，更加坚定了自己革命的世界观。他们听党的话，和群众打成一片，说得少做得多，干字当头；有力争上游的雄心壮志，有实事求是的作风；在工作上，生活上艰苦朴素，处处以身作则。
    他们从一九五七年开始，经常到班组去，到最艰苦的地方去，到问题多的地方去劳动。一九六一年厂里提出“发电煤耗破五百克大关”时，锅炉正在掺烧煤矸石。因为这种矸石经常灭火，党委书记、厂长、总工程师等就分三条战线跟班劳动，通过劳动和工人共同研究办法，顺利地解决了掺烧煤矸石的问题。
    深入实际，联系群众，是这个厂领导干部的一个好传统。有一个时期，有些青年工人对宿舍有意见，党委书记耿德林就搬到集体宿舍和他们一起住。几天后他发现，这里既有屋子冷的实际问题，也有怕艰苦的思想问题。他就发动群众一起动手，增装取暖设备；同时对工人反复进行革命传统的教育和新旧社会对比的教育。因此，既解决了实际问题，也解决了思想问题。
    这个厂的领导干部生活上与群众同甘共苦，和工人住一样的房子。一九六五年改建旧厂房后，可以解决二十九户职工的宿舍问题。当时，工厂领导决定：一，领导干部不要；二，教育职工抢困难让方便，分配给最急需的人。职工们说，领导同志那么艰苦朴素，我们应该向他们看齐。
    工厂领导干部的作风带动全厂职工形成了勤俭节约的风气。这个工厂每度电的耗煤量，从一九四九年的七百六十克，下降到一九六五年的四百九十二克。如以一九四九年耗煤水平计算，十六年来共为国家节约了近百万吨煤炭。（据新华社稿）
