    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th—Just as the United States and the South Vietnamese puppet clique are holding the Honolulu Conference to plot the expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku and others have been shouting in recent days that Japan should "thoroughly fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" and closely coordinate with the United States' aggressive steps in all aspects.

    Prime Minister Sato said at the plenary session of the House of Representatives on January 31, "There is absolutely no reason to prevent the provision of bases to the United States, or to prevent U.S. troops going to Vietnam from staying in Japan, according to the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty." He also said, "The obligations stipulated in the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty should be fully, completely, and thoroughly fulfilled."

    Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Shoji Keijiro, stated in the Senate: "Based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, it is only right to allow U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carriers to dock in Japan."

    Foreign Minister Shiina Etsusaburo and other responsible officials, in their answers in the Diet, even blatantly created "legal grounds" for Japan to send troops abroad. Shiina said on the 5th at the House of Representatives Budget Committee: "The Constitution allows Japanese troops to participate in the United Nations 'peace monitoring groups'." Takatsuji Masami, Director-General of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, further explained on the 9th: "Although Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution prohibits Japan from initiating military actions, it is 'permitted' for Japan to provide troops if it is a military action with other (countries) as the main entity."

    Under the clamor of responsible officials of the Sato government, the Japanese military authorities are eager to move. According to a report in the Akahata [Red Flag newspaper] on the 10th, Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force Chief of Staff Tomoharu Nishimura openly instructed his troops: "The situation in Asia is extremely turbulent. In the event of an incident, the 'Self-Defense Forces' should immediately rush to the battlefield at a moment's notice."

    On the same day that the Honolulu Conference had just concluded, the Sato government publicly announced that it would give the South Vietnamese puppet clique $200,000 in emergency assistance. The Japanese Foreign Ministry admitted that this was decided based on the request of U.S. Vice President Humphrey and the spirit of the "Honolulu Declaration."

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th—Utsunomiya Tokuma, a member of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, published an article in the pre-released March issue of "Sekai" [The World magazine], opposing the unequal Japan-U.S. relationship and demanding that the Sato government change its foreign policy of subservience to the United States.

    Utsunomiya pointed out that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" not only affirmed the legitimacy of the permanent stationing of U.S. troops in Japan and the permanent use of Japan as a U.S. military base, but also placed the entire Japan-U.S. relationship on such an unequal basis. He said that through the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Japan has granted the United States many substantial rights that endanger Japan's independence, while Japan has only received the empty guarantee of "the right to request (American) protection in times of crisis."

    He said that the idea that the existence of China and other socialist countries in the Far East constitutes a real "major threat" to Japan does not exist. The most important issue for Japan is that it must develop friendly relations with China. This is the starting point for Japan's Asian diplomacy and the starting point for Japan's independent diplomacy towards the United States.

    Utsunomiya pointed out that in the economic sphere, Japan bears an annual trade deficit of more than $1.5 billion with the United States and the regions under its economic control. Judging from the content of Japan-U.S. trade, there are many things that do not necessarily have to be imported from the United States; on the contrary, it would be cheaper to import them from China and other Asian and African countries. Although Japan has given the United States a lot of consideration in this regard, the United States restricts the import of Japanese goods. At the same time, it is openly and secretly undermining Japan's trade with China.

    紧密配合檀香山会议策划扩大侵越战争的阴谋
    佐藤叫嚷有义务支持美帝侵越
    宇都宫德马要求佐藤政府改变屈从美国的政策
    新华社东京十日电　正当美国同南越傀儡集团举行檀香山会议阴谋扩大侵越战争的时候，日本首相佐藤荣作等连日叫嚷日本要“彻底履行日美安全条约规定的义务”，从各方面密切配合美国的侵略步骤。
    佐藤首相曾在一月三十一日的众议院全体会议上说：“向美国提供基地、允许去越南的美军在日本停留，根据日美安全条约，完全没有理由阻止”。他还说：“应当充分地、完全地、彻底地履行日美安全条约所规定的义务”。
    外务省政务次官正示启次郎在参议院表示：“基于日美安全条约，理应允许美国核动力航空母舰到日本停泊。”
    外务大臣椎名悦三郎及其他负责官员，在国会答辩时，甚至明目张胆地为日本派兵出国制造“法律根据”。椎名五日在众议院预算委员会上说：“日本军队参加联合国的‘和平监察团’，宪法是允许的。”日本内阁法制局长高辻正巳九日进一步解释说：“虽然日本宪法第九条禁止日本自己发动军事行动，但是如果是以其它（国家）为主体的军事行动，日本提供军队”，“是被允许的”。
    在佐藤政府负责官员这种叫嚣下，日本军事当局蠢蠢欲动。据十日《赤旗报》报道，日本海军参谋长西村友晴向他的部队公然训示说：“亚洲形势极为动荡，万一发生事情，‘自卫队’就应该一声令下立即奔赴战场。”
    就在檀香山会议刚刚结束的同一天，佐藤政府公开宣布它给南越傀儡集团二十万美元紧急援助。日本外务省承认，这是根据美国副总统汉弗莱的要求和“檀香山宣言”的精神决定的。
    据新华社东京十日电　日本自由民主党国会议员宇都宫德马，在提前出版的三月号《世界》杂志上发表文章，反对不平等的日美关系，并且要求佐藤政府改变屈从美国的外交政策。
    宇都宫指出，日美“安全条约”不仅肯定了美军永久驻在日本和永远把日本做为美军基地的合法性，而且把整个日美关系放在这样一个不平等的基础上。他说，通过日美“安全条约”，日本给予了美国很多危害日本独立的实质性的权利，而日本得到的只是“在危急的时候有权请求（美国）保护”的空洞保证。
    他说，认为中国等社会主义国家在远东的存在会构成对日本现实的“重大威胁”这种事实是不存在的。对日本最重要的问题，是必须发展和中国的友好关系。这是日本实行亚洲外交的出发点，也是日本对美国实行自主外交的出发点。
    宇都宫指出，在经济方面，日本同美国和受它的经济控制的地区的贸易，每年承担着超过十五亿美元的入超。从日美贸易内容看，有许多东西不一定从美国进口，相反从中国和其它亚非国家进口更便宜。尽管日本在这一方面给美国很多照顾，但是美国却限制日本商品的进口。同时，它还在明里暗里破坏日本同中国的贸易。
