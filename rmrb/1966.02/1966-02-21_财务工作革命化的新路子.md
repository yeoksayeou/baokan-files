　　Under the impetus of the Socialist Education Movement, financial workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, through the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, learning from the People's Liberation Army, learning from Daqing, and learning from Dazhai, adhere to using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, using materialist dialectics to oppose metaphysics and complicated philosophy; using the Party's mass line to oppose the expert line and supervision supremacy; using the "Four Firsts" to oppose purely professional viewpoints; using the "Three-Eight Style" to oppose bureaucracy; using the principle of running enterprises with diligence and thrift to oppose the extravagant and wasteful style of young masters; and using socialist enterprise management thinking to oppose capitalist management thinking. In the process of revolutionizing financial work, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has created new experiences such as comprehensive mobile service teams, economic activity analysis work teams, on-site service personnel, and worker economic accounting personnel. These are new things that have emerged in the revolutionization of financial work. These new things are an organic whole, interconnected and mutually promoting; these new things have opened up a new path for further carrying out the revolutionization of financial work, so that financial work can better face production, face the masses, and serve production.

　　The experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company shows that to achieve the revolutionization of financial work, it is necessary to solve both the problem of "working for revolution" and the problem of "knowing how to make revolution." Without solving the problem of "working for revolution," there will be no correct political direction, and there can be no correct revolutionary methods. If we only solve the problem of "working for revolution" without solving the problem of "knowing how to make revolution," even with good intentions, we will not achieve good results.

　　The revolutionization of financial work did not start today. Several years ago, the Central Committee repeatedly instructed that we should establish firm "Three Great Viewpoints" (political viewpoint, production viewpoint, mass viewpoint) and solve the problem of "Three Orientations" (orientation towards production, orientation towards the masses, orientation towards the grassroots). Over the past few years, we have also done a lot of work in this area, and there have been great improvements in ideology, work, and style. However, ideological revolutionization is not yet thorough, politics and professional work have not been well integrated, and the "Four Firsts" have not been implemented. Therefore, we have not yet found appropriate forms and methods for how financial work can serve politics, serve production, and serve the masses through professional work. The valuable aspect of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's experience lies in solving the problem of "working for revolution" and "knowing how to make revolution," pointing out the direction of politics commanding professional work. The comprehensive mobile service team and the economic activity analysis work team of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, composed of comrades from the financial accounting department, in collaboration with comrades from the planning, machinery, power, and material supply departments, through the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, on the ideological basis of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and single-mindedly serving production, and after hitting many snags and overcoming many difficulties, have blazed a new trail. It has not only found a path for the revolutionization of financial work but also promoted the revolutionization of the entire enterprise management.

　　The characteristic of the comprehensive mobile service team is to organically combine relevant departments, combine their respective businesses, delve into the reality of production, rely on the masses, conduct investigations and research, clarify the needs in production, and solve problems in production effectively and promptly based on the possibilities of funding, materials, and technology. Anything that should be supported is supported by those in charge of finance, planning, materials and equipment, and technology; anything that should not be supported, or cannot be solved temporarily, is explained and not resolved. This combines fund allocation and usage effects, funds and materials, economy and technology, needs and possibilities. In the past, some financial departments did not delve into the grassroots, did not contact the masses, and did not cooperate with other departments, often resulting in bureaucracy and rigid adherence to rules; some financial departments, when it came to service, served in isolation, went down one line, and fought alone. Although the funding problem was solved, it was not combined with production technology, material supply, and other departments, and as a result, the problems in production still could not be well resolved. The comprehensive mobile service team solves this problem. From the perspective of financial work, there is both service and supervision here; it promotes production development and also taps potential; it opposes rigid adherence to rules and can also solve problems realistically; it can solve the actual needs of production according to time and place and can also adhere to comprehensive balance and implement planned management. Here, politics and professional work are unified, division of labor and combination are unified, management and service are unified, conflicts between superiors and subordinates are reduced, the phenomenon of buck-passing between each other is reduced, and the work is made more lively.

　　The economic activity analysis work team, with the financial department as the main force, in collaboration with planning, technology, and other departments, and together with the resident finance officer, delves into the front line, participates in labor, conducts investigations and research with the workers, promotes the reform of business management and technology, taps production potential, improves business management, and improves the level of planned management by means of economic activity analysis. This is also a revolutionary action for the financial department to serve production and promote increased production and economy.

　　The comprehensive mobile service team and the economic activity analysis work team are new things. At present, they are not yet perfect and need to be further summarized and improved in practice. However, its basic direction is correct, and if we persist in this direction, we will surely achieve greater results.

　　In an enterprise, the financial department can and should exchange information, cooperate, support each other, and act in coordination with the production technology, material supply, and other departments. Only in this way can we better serve production and vigorously promote the development of production. The financial department should proactively understand the needs of production and the possibilities of technology and materials, help and collaborate with the production technology department to calculate economic effects and study economic rationality, and combine funds with production technology and materials. The revolutionization of financial work is to learn the spirit of the comprehensive mobile service team and the economic activity analysis work team, to organize the forces of finance, planning, production, supply, and technology, to go out of the office together, to be service personnel in the work teams, to mobilize workers to participate in management, to promote work team accounting, and to proactively solve key problems in production. In this way, problems can be grasped more accurately, collective strength can be brought into play, production can be served, and production potential can be tapped; the limited manpower, material resources, and financial resources can be practically and promptly used where they are most needed, resulting in greater economic effects and boosting production; and the shortcomings of not understanding the situation below and rigid adherence to rules can be overcome.

　　Revolutionizing departments and serving on site must be combined with mobilizing workers to participate in management and vigorously promoting mass-based work team accounting. Work team accounting has been carried out for many years in the past, but it has not been well maintained. What is the reason? The experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company gives us the answer. That is, mobilizing workers to participate in management and consolidating work team accounting must be combined with the work of revolutionizing departments and serving on site. Otherwise, the bottom is bustling, and the top is deserted, without guidance or being valued, and of course, it will not be maintained. Implementing the method of fixed-point and fixed-time on-site service by department personnel is both service and management; they are both service personnel and propagandists; they are familiar with production and combine it with their own business. Department personnel work and discuss with workers, make intimate friends, and at any time publicize the Party's policies and the idea of diligence and thrift, and carry out mass-based economic activity analysis. The role of work team accounting is mainly to educate the workers and the masses to understand how much labor and raw materials they have spent, how many products they have created, and how much contribution they have made to the country; to enable the workers and the masses to cherish their labor achievements more, to constantly look for gaps, tap potential, and save raw materials and fuel; to understand the relationship between the production activities of their team and group and supporting national construction and world revolution; and to understand the significance of their own labor and savings. In this way, the enthusiasm of the workers and the masses to participate in management is further mobilized, and the sense of responsibility of the workers as masters of managing finances is improved.

　　In short, the revolutionization of financial work must combine top and bottom, follow the mass line, establish firm political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints, and adhere to highlighting politics in work, with politics commanding professional work, in order to fundamentally solve the problem. The experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has pointed out the direction for the revolutionization of financial work. We believe that the revolutionization of financial work will surely be further developed in practice and will blaze a new trail.

　　财务工作革命化的新路子
　　舒江波
    在社会主义教育运动的推动下，鞍山钢铁公司的财务工作者通过活学活用毛主席著作，学解放军、学大庆、学大寨，坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，用唯物辩证法，反对形而上学和烦琐哲学；用党的群众路线，反对专家路线、监督至上；用四个第一，反对单纯业务观点；用三八作风，反对官僚主义；用勤俭办企业的方针，反对铺张浪费的大少爷作风；用社会主义办企业思想，反对资本主义经营思想。在财务工作革命化的过程中，鞍山钢铁公司创造了综合巡回服务组、经济活动分析工作队、现场服务员、工人经济核算员等新的经验。这是财务工作革命化过程中出现的新事物。这些新事物是有机的结合体，是互有联系、互相促进的；这些新事物，为进一步开展财务工作革命化，使财务工作更好地面向生产、面向群众、为生产服务打开了一个新的路子。
    鞍山钢铁公司的经验表明，要实现财务工作革命化，既要解决为革命的问题，又要解决会革命的问题。不解决为革命的问题，就没有正确的政治方向，也就不可能有正确的革命方法。如果我们只解决为革命的问题，而不解决会革命的问题，即使有良好的心愿，也达不到良好的效果。
    财务工作革命化，不是从今日开始的。几年前，中央反复指示，要树立牢固的三大观点（政治观点、生产观点、群众观点），解决三个面向（面向生产、面向群众、面向基层）的问题。几年来，我们在这方面也做了不少工作，在思想上、工作上、作风上都有很大的改进。但是，思想革命化还不彻底，政治和业务没有很好挂起钩来，四个第一没有落实下去。因而，财务工作如何通过业务工作为政治服务，为生产服务，为群众服务，还没有找到适当的形式和方法。鞍山钢铁公司的经验可贵之处，就在于解决了为革命和会革命的问题，指出了政治统帅业务的方向。鞍山钢铁公司的综合巡回服务组和经济活动分析工作队，就是以财务会计处的同志协同计划、机械、动力、物资供应等部门的同志，活学活用毛主席著作，在全心全意为革命，一心一意为生产的思想基础上，在碰了很多钉子、克服不少的困难之后，闯出来的一条路子。它不但为财务工作革命化找到了门径，而且也促进了整个企业管理革命化。
    综合巡回服务组的特点是，把有关部门有机地结合起来，结合各自的业务，深入生产实际，依靠群众，进行调查研究，把生产中的需要弄清楚了，根据资金、物资与技术的可能性，切实有效而又及时地解决生产中的问题。凡是该支持的，搞财务的、搞计划的、搞材料设备的、搞技术的都一起支持；凡是不该支持的，或暂时解决不了的，就说明道理，不予解决。这样就把资金分配和使用效果、资金和物资、经济与技术、需要与可能结合起来了。过去，有的财务部门不深入基层，不联系群众，不同其他部门协作，常常产生官僚主义和发生死扣硬卡的毛病；有的财务部门一谈到服务，就孤立地服务，单线下去，孤军作战，虽然解决了资金问题，但却没有和生产技术、物资供应等部门结合起来，结果是生产中的问题仍然不能得到很好的解决。综合巡回服务组解决了这个问题。从财务工作来说，这里既有服务，又有监督；既促进了生产发展，又挖掘了潜力；既反对了死扣硬卡，又能实事求是地解决问题；既能因时因地地解决了生产实际的需要，又能坚持综合平衡，实行计划管理。这里，政治与业务统一起来了，分工与结合统一起来了，管理与服务统一起来了，上下之间的矛盾减少了，相互之间扯皮的现象减少了，工作也就做活了。
    经济活动分析工作队，是以财务部门为主，协同计划、技术等部门，和财政驻厂员一起，深入现场，参加劳动，和工人一起进行调查研究，以经济活动分析为手段，促进经营管理和工艺的改革，挖掘生产潜力，改善经营管理，提高计划管理水平。这也是财务部门为生产服务，促进增产节约的一种革命化行动。
    综合巡回服务组和经济活动分析工作队是一个新生事物。目前，它还不尽完善，需要在实践中进一步总结提高。但是，它的基本方向是对的，按照这个方向坚持下去，就一定会做出更大的成绩来。
    在企业里，财务部门可以而且应该同生产技术、物资供应等部门互相通气，互相配合，互相支持，协同动作。只有这样，才能够更好地为生产服务，有力地促进生产的发展。财务部门要主动了解生产的需要，技术、物资的可能性，要帮助和协同生产技术部门计算经济效果，研究经济的合理性，把资金同生产技术、物资结合起来。财务工作的革命化，就是要学习综合巡回服务组和经济活动分析工作队的精神，把财务、计划、生产、供应、技术方面的力量组织起来，一起走出办公室，到班组当服务员，发动工人参加管理，推行班组核算，主动解决生产上的关键问题。这样，就可以把问题抓得更准，发挥集体力量，为生产服务，挖掘生产潜力；就可以切实地、及时地把有限的人力、物力、财力用到刀刃上，发挥更大的经济效果，把生产促上去；就可以克服不了解下情，死扣硬卡的缺点。
    科室革命化、服务到现场要同发动工人参加管理、大搞群众性班组核算相结合。班组核算过去搞了好多年，但都没有很好地坚持下来。什么原因呢？鞍山钢铁公司的经验给我们作了回答。这就是，发动工人参加管理、巩固班组核算，要同科室革命化、服务到现场的工作相结合。否则下面轰轰烈烈，上面冷冷清清，没有引导，不被重视，当然也就坚持不下去。实行科室人员定点、定时上岗服务的办法，既服务，又管理；既是服务员，又是宣传员；既熟悉了生产，又结合了本身业务。科室人员与工人同劳动，同商量，交上知心朋友，随时宣传党的方针政策和勤俭节约的思想，开展群众性的经济活动分析。班组核算的作用，主要是为了教育工人群众懂得自己花费多少劳动和原材料，创造了多少产品，为国家作了多少贡献；使工人群众更加珍惜自己的劳动成果，不断地寻找差距，挖潜力，节约原材料、燃料；懂得本班本组的生产活动，同支援国家建设和世界革命的关系；懂得本身劳动和节约的意义。这样，就更加调动了工人群众参加管理的积极性，也就提高了工人当家理财的主人翁思想。
    总之，财务工作革命化，必须上下结合，走群众路线，树立牢固的政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，工作中坚持突出政治，以政治统帅业务，才能从根本上解决问题。鞍山钢铁公司的经验，为财务工作革命化指出了方向。我们相信，财务工作革命化，一定能够在实践中得到进一步的发展，闯出一条崭新的路子来。
