　　Learning from Jiao Yulu
　　Respected Comrades of the Lankao County Committee
    With a heart full of excitement, I finished reading the newsletter "The Example of a County Party Secretary - Jiao Yulu," and my heart remained stirred for a long time.
    I met Comrade Jiao Yulu when I enlisted in the army in August 1963. That day, some of us young people who were about to enlist came to the county guest house. Comrade Jiao Yulu received us, shaking hands and talking with us warmly. He said to us, "You are all young and strong fellows, with education and talent. When you get to the army, listen to the Party and study Chairman Mao's writings diligently. We are waiting at home for your victorious news."
    As we were leaving, he escorted us all the way to the train station, and also told us, "Take good care of yourselves on the road, pay attention to safety, and write to us after you get to Beijing." Reluctantly, I looked at Comrade Jiao Yulu, slowly loosened my grip on his hand, saluted him, and boarded the train. The train slowly started moving, and I saw him waving to us from the platform through the glass window.
    Last July and August, the leaders of my unit approved my return home for a family visit. As soon as I got off the train, I felt that Lankao's appearance was very different from the past. It was truly a scene of abundant harvest. I thought: A few years ago, this place was either drought-stricken or flooded. Now it has become a "green oasis" that is not afraid of drought, floods, or alkaline soil. I was extremely happy in my heart.
    I have been in the army for less than three years, and I have done as he said. Last year, I honorably joined the Communist Party. In the future, I want to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of seeing hope in difficulties and remaining steadfast in the revolution; to learn from his noble character of loving the people and working tirelessly for the people; to learn from his excellent style of going deep into reality year after year and attaching importance to investigation and research. In the final analysis, I want to learn from his revolutionary spirit of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, resolutely acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and wholeheartedly serving the revolution and the people completely and thoroughly.

　　向焦裕禄学习
　　敬爱的兰考县县委会同志
    我怀着满腔激动的心情，读完了《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》这篇通讯，心里久久不能平静。
    我是在一九六三年八月入伍的时候认识焦裕禄同志的。那天，我们一些要入伍的青年人来到县招待所。焦裕禄同志接见了我们，和我们亲切地握手、谈话。他对我们说：“你们都是年青的硬小伙子，有文化有才干，到了部队，要听党的话，好好学习毛主席著作，我们在家里等着你们的胜利消息。”
    临走时，他一直把我们送到火车站，还嘱咐我们：“路上搞好生活，注意安全，到北京后就来信。”我恋恋不舍地看着焦裕禄同志，慢慢松开了握紧的手，向他敬了个礼上了火车。火车徐徐地开动，我从玻璃窗里看到他还在站台上向我们招手。
    去年七八月间，部队领导上批准我回乡探亲。一下火车，就觉得兰考的面貌和过去大不相同。真是一派丰收景象。我想：几年前，这里不是旱就是涝，现在变成旱、涝、碱都不怕的“绿洲”了。我心里高兴极了。
    我入伍不到三年，按照他的话去做了，去年光荣地参加了共产党。今后，我要学习焦裕禄同志那种在困难中看到希望，对革命坚定不移的精神；学习他那种热爱人民，为人民不辞千辛万苦的高尚品格；学习他那种长年深入实际，重视调查研究的优良作风。归根结底，要学习他那种活学活用毛主席著作，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，一心一意为革命，完全、彻底地为人民服务的革命精神。
