    Why Insist on This "View"?
    ——A Critique of Wu Han's "Self-Criticism" Regarding His Understanding of Honest Officials
    Yu Xinze
    Summary: In his "Self-Criticism," Comrade Wu Han insists that his view of honest officials has always been correct. He believes that under the oppression of the feudal class, the working people "yearned for" "clear, lenient, and honest governance." They had no contradictions with the landlord class, only with "local officials." Their form of class struggle was "filing lawsuits." This fundamentally denies class struggle in feudal society.
    He believes that although honest officials served the feudal ruling class, they were still the "heaven" of the people. This is a thorough feudal landlord class viewpoint.
    After fervently propagating the fallacy that the "honest official" Hai Rui was "standing on the side of the peasants and citizens," he then says, "It is absolutely impossible to conclude that 'heaven' is a politician standing on the side of the people." This is playing deceptive tricks, attempting to cover up his erroneous views.
    He insists on the view that the "long-term interests of the feudal ruling class" are "consistent with the current interests of the broad masses of the people." This is openly propagating the theory of class reconciliation and advocating class cooperation.
    In the final analysis, Comrade Wu Han insists on these erroneous views to defend his play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and refuses criticism.

    It has been over a month since the discussion of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" began and Comrade Wu Han published his "Self-Criticism." One of the important issues involved in the discussion is how to evaluate historical honest officials. On this issue, as with other issues, Comrade Wu Han has not listened to the criticisms of many comrades but insists on his own erroneous views. In answering the criticisms of others, he cited a large passage from "Kuang Zhong and Zhou Chen," which he wrote in 1960, to prove that his view of honest officials is beyond reproach. He then said: "After examining it today, I basically have not changed this view." This clearly says that his view of honest officials was correct in the past and is still correct now. So, what exactly are the things contained in Comrade Wu Han's "view" of honest officials? Why does he insist on this "view" and resolutely refuse to change it?
    Let's start with the passage from "Kuang Zhong and Zhou Chen." A careful appreciation of this quoted passage reveals that Comrade Wu Han's discourse on honest officials is actually a "strange text." No wonder Comrade Wu Han loves it so much and insists on it so much! This "strange text" contains many bizarre arguments, which people can use to broaden their horizons.
    One bizarre argument is that: "Because the foundation of the feudal ruling class's rule is based on the exploitation and plunder of the broad masses of peasants, feudal bureaucrats serve the interests of the landlord class; the ultimate purpose of all political measures is to consolidate and strengthen feudal rule. Thus, it is not difficult to understand that under the oppression and enslavement of feudal bureaucrats, the broad masses of people yearn for a relatively clear, lenient, and honest governance, and support good officials who can take some measures to reduce the burden on the people and redress their grievances."
    According to Comrade Wu Han's "view," the oppressed and exploited working people in feudal society "yearn for" only "relatively clear, lenient, and honest governance"; the only measures they can take are to "support" some "honest officials" and ask "honest officials" to "reduce" some "burdens" for them and "redress" some "grievances," and so on. Apart from this, they have no other "yearnings"! Under the enslavement and oppression of the feudal landlord class, do the broad masses of people "yearn for" revolutionary struggle? This is not answered directly in this "Self-Criticism," but in fact, he has repeatedly explained it.
    He said: "The class contradiction in this region is the contradiction between the peasants and local officials, not the general contradiction between the peasants and the landlords; the class struggle in this region is the class struggle between the peasants and local officials." That is to say, in Comrade Wu Han's view, there is no contradiction between the general landlords and the peasants, and the peasants do not struggle against them; only those local officials have contradictions with the peasants, and the peasants struggle with them. Anyone with a little common sense knows that in feudal society, the contradiction between the landlord class and the peasant class is the most fundamental contradiction. Since Comrade Wu Han has canceled this most fundamental contradiction, then what class contradiction and revolutionary struggle are there to speak of?
    So, how do the peasants struggle against the local officials? Comrade Wu Han said: "Filing lawsuits is also a low-level form of class struggle." It is precisely from this point of departure that in the play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," although the Hong Alan family has three generations of grievances, the only revenge method she thinks of is "filing lawsuits," "filing lawsuits," and no other "yearnings." And for "filing lawsuits" to be successful, it is necessary for an "honest official" to appear to help. In Comrade Wu Han's "theory" and the work "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," it seems that there is indeed such an "honest official," who, although he is also a member of the feudal bureaucracy, can stand on the side of the peasants in the "class struggle" (filing lawsuits) between the peasants and the local officials, reduce the burden on the peasants, and redress the grievances of the peasants. Since there are such "honest officials" and "good officials," it goes without saying that the broad masses of the people have no need to "yearn for" revolutionary struggle!
    Comrade Wu Han has obliterated the basic contradictions of feudal society and created a miraculous plan for carrying out class struggle. It is no wonder that in his other articles, he is deeply disgusted and vehemently opposed to historical peasant uprisings and the yearning for revolution. He said: "To emphasize the justice of peasant uprisings, it is necessary to relatively portray the sinful activities of the feudal ruling class." Of feudal society, "the leading figures of relatively prosperous times are not written about or are rarely described. Thus, the bright side of history is lost. What is written in the books is all about how bad this dynasty was, how the peasant uprising overthrew it, how another dynasty rose, and how bad it was again, how the peasant uprising overthrew it again. It is all a sound of overthrowing, and history has almost become a pitch-black mass, gloomy and desolate." Comrade Wu Han here frankly expressed his historical views and class feelings. He hates the class struggle in history—peasant uprisings—so much, and he loves the emperors, generals, "honest officials," and "good emperors" in history so much.
    I think that Comrade Wu Han's frankness should be affirmed. Indeed, today, who has such courage to "dare" to speak for the long-overthrown feudal landlord class? Who "dares" to openly regard the leaders of the feudal ruling class—emperors and generals—as the "bright side" of history, and to curse the great peasant uprising movement that promoted historical progress as a "pitch-black mass"? It seems that Comrade Wu Han is indeed "of the 'dare' class"! He not only "dares" to see it this way, "dares" to say it this way, but also still "dares" to insist on it to this day. Unfortunately, what he insists on is not correct, but a very wrong viewpoint.
    A second bizarre argument is that: "For good officials who can take some measures to reduce the burden on the people and redress their grievances... the people have made an appraisal and called them 'heaven'.... However, it is absolutely impossible to conclude from this that 'heaven' is a politician standing on the side of the people. No, on the contrary, they are all bureaucrats who serve the interests of the feudal ruling class. On this point, they are also opposed to the people, just like other feudal bureaucrats at that time."
    Comrade Wu Han's passage, on the surface, seems to say that the people's "appraisal" of "good officials" in history lacks class analysis, and we should adhere to the class viewpoint. But in fact, Comrade Wu Han's meaning is not like this. First, Comrade Wu Han has repeatedly stated in many places that the phenomenon of the people calling some "honest officials" "heaven" in history is not to negate this statement and make a serious class analysis of this phenomenon; on the contrary, it is to repeatedly affirm it. Second, Comrade Wu Han himself also calls these "honest officials" "heaven." In this article "Kuang Zhong and Zhou Chen," he also specifically established the section "Kuang Qingtian" and said: "The people of Suzhou finally had a heaven and breathed a sigh of relief," and so on. Because in Comrade Wu Han's view, the working people do not "yearn for" revolution at all, but only "yearn for" "clear, lenient, and honest" governance, that is to say, they only deserve the fate of being oppressed and exploited. Then, since such "honest officials" have appeared, who have "consciously done some good things on the premise of not harming the fundamental interests of the feudal ruling class," and since they have kindly "been lenient" to the working people, how can the working people not be "grateful" to them? How can they not shout the slogan "Lord Qingtian will be forever," that is, "Long live honest officials"?
    It is true that there has been such a phenomenon in history, that is, the working people have illusions about "honest officials" and call them "heaven." This is the result of the working people being deceived by the feudal ruling class and poisoned by feudal ideology for a long time. Then, Comrade Wu Han, who claims to have stood firm on the class standpoint, should not be fervently promoting "honest officials" and the role of "heaven" today. But on the contrary, he praised Kuang Zhong and Zhou Chen to the extreme, believing that they "should be affirmed and worthy of commemoration in history, and in some aspects, they are still figures worthy of learning from today." As for Hai Rui, he worships him even more, praising him as the "savior" of the peasants and wishing him "forever" and "thousands of families burn incense." Comrade Wu Han's evaluation of these "honest officials" has long thrown the Marxist class viewpoint to the clouds, and what has replaced it is a complete feudal ruling class viewpoint! Is Comrade Wu Han's promotion of "honest officials" a result of being "deceived," or is it for the purpose of deception? Comrade Wu Han, who claims to have "overcome the supra-class viewpoint" as early as fifteen years ago, would not be believed if he said he was "deceived." Then, what is left is only for the purpose of deception. --Whether it is "received" or "for," in short, it continues to play a deceptive role on people, which can be affirmed.
    Comrade Wu Han said: "It is absolutely impossible to conclude from this that 'heaven' is a politician standing on the side of the people." But who exactly "concluded" such a "conclusion"? Isn't it himself? In September 1959, he said in "On Hai Rui": "Honest official" Hai Rui "is a consistent politician who is deeply loved by the broad masses of people. He stood on the side of the peasants and citizens and fought the feudal bureaucrats and big landlords throughout his life." Said: "For cases where peasants and landlords filed lawsuits, he stood on the side of the peasants. Magistrate Hai and Imperial Censor Hai were the saviors of the oppressed, bullied, and wronged people at that time." "He always thought about the people and sought benefits for the people in everything he did throughout his life." A year later, in September 1960, he changed his tone and taught people that "it is absolutely impossible to draw such a 'conclusion' from this." And in less than two months, in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," he actually portrayed Hai Rui as the savior of the people again. Which of these three articles, with two opposing viewpoints, represents Comrade Wu Han's viewpoint? Now, this "self-criticism," which is said to be written with "sincerity," lonely presents that passage from 1960, saying that "I have basically not changed this view." Then, may I ask Comrade Wu Han, have you changed your views in "On Hai Rui" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"? Is this "view" that you are now presenting correct again? In academic discussions, it is allowed to insist on one's own viewpoint; but it is absolutely not allowed to put two kinds of goods in one basket, and take out whatever is needed. Is this cunning technique a "sincere" "self-criticism," or a "hypocritical" "self-criticism"?
    A third bizarre argument is that: These "honest officials" and "good officials" "consciously did some good things. These good things are consistent with the long-term interests of the feudal ruling class, and are also consistent with the current interests of the oppressed and exploited broad masses of the people."
    According to Comrade Wu Han's "view," the "long-term interests of the ruling class" are also the "current interests" of the "oppressed and exploited broad masses of the people." The two are "consistent" and there is no contradiction. What are the "long-term interests of the feudal ruling class"? Of course, it is to exploit and rule the working people in the long term. In class society, no ruling class has ever hoped that its rule would be permanent, and no ruling class has ever based its rule on class oppression and class exploitation. How can their interests be "consistent" with the interests of the oppressed and exploited classes? To think that they have "consistent" interests is to completely remove the sharp conflict of class interests between two opposing classes. As a result, class contradictions do not exist, and the two opposing classes can cooperate and embrace each other! Comrade Wu Han here is clearly promoting the theory of class reconciliation? It is true that in class society, when the ruling class makes certain reforms in politics or economy, it can bring certain benefits to the working people at that time. However, certain benefits do not equal the "current interests" of the broad masses of the people. This is only the difference between the working people being exploited more or less. It will never change the fate of the working people being exploited and oppressed. Therefore, the conflict of class interests between the two opposing classes cannot be eliminated and cannot be "consistent." Comrade Wu Han vigorously promotes this "consistent" theory of the interests of two opposing classes. May I ask, in today's international and domestic class struggle, which class's interests is it "consistent" with, and which ideology is it "consistent" with?
    After the above analysis, it can be seen that, for Comrade Wu Han, what he insists on is indeed very important. These are the "essence" of his "theory," which cannot be "changed" easily. As early as February 1961 (shortly after the performance of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"), he stated that many people would be dissatisfied after watching this play, "but I will never admit my mistake, because there is no mistake to admit," "it must not be considered a mistake." Why be so self-possessed? Because if this "view" is "changed," wouldn't "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" lose its "theoretical" pillar? Wouldn't the "great husband" become a "small husband"? Wouldn't the "true man" become a "fake man"? Therefore, to insist on this "view" is to insist on "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." Doesn't "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" fundamentally not write about the class struggle of the working people, but only about their "yearning for a relatively clear, lenient, and honest governance"? Doesn't it fundamentally not write about their "yearning for" revolution, but only about their "support" for "honest officials"? Aren't the working people in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" constantly "appraising" Hai Rui, calling him "Hai Qingtian," "Hai Father," and "Hai Dragon King"? Isn't Hai Rui in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" fighting for the "long-term interests of the feudal ruling class" while being completely "consistent with the current interests of the oppressed and exploited broad masses of the people"? Since Comrade Wu Han insists that his "view" of "honest officials" has "not changed," it is equivalent to saying that his "view" of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" has "not changed." Criticism is up to you, I will "praise" the "good official"! What "made me realize my mistakes," etc., are just words to cover up the "wind and rain"!

    为什么坚持这个“看法”？
    ——评吴晗同志《自我批评》里对清官的认识
    余心泽
    提要　吴晗同志在《自我批评》里坚持他对清官的看法一贯正确。他认为在封建阶级的压迫下劳动人民“向往”的是“清明、宽大、廉洁的政治”。他们与地主阶级是没有矛盾的，只有与“乡官”的矛盾。他们的阶级斗争形式是“告状”。这是根本否定了封建社会里的阶级斗争。
    他认为清官虽然是为封建统治阶级服务的，但他们仍是人民的“青天”。这是彻头彻尾的封建地主阶级的观点。
    他在狂热地宣扬了“清官”海瑞是“站在农民和市民立场上”的谬论以后，又说“决不可以得出结论，以为青天就是站在人民立场上的政治家”。这是玩弄欺骗伎俩，企图掩盖自己的错误观点。
    他坚持“封建统治阶级的长远利益”与“广大人民当前利益一致”的观点，这是公然宣扬阶级调和论，鼓吹阶级合作。
    归根结蒂，吴晗同志坚持这些错误观点，目的是为他的《海瑞罢官》辩护，拒绝批评。
    自从开展《海瑞罢官》的讨论以来，到吴晗同志发表《自我批评》，其间已有一个多月。讨论中涉及的重要问题之一，就是如何评价历史上的清官。在这个问题上，也和对待其它问题一样，吴晗同志根本没有听取许多同志对他的批评意见，而是坚持自己的错误观点。他在回答别人的批评时，引证了一九六○年他写的《况钟与周忱》中的一大段话，证明他对清官的看法是无可非议的，然后说道：“今天检查起来，这个看法我基本上还没有什么改变”。这分明是说：他对清官的看法，过去正确，现在也仍然正确。那末，吴晗同志对清官的“看法”究竟是一些什么样的货色？为什么他要坚持这个“看法”而坚决不肯改变呢？
    还是从《况钟与周忱》的那一段引文谈起吧。仔细欣赏一下这段引文，可以发现吴晗同志关于清官的论述原来竟是一篇“奇文”，难怪吴晗同志要对它如此心爱，如此坚持了！在这篇“奇文”里，包含着许多奇谈怪论，人们大可借此开开眼界。
    奇谈怪论之一是说：“由于封建统治阶级的统治基础是建立在对广大农民的剥削、掠夺上面的，封建官僚是为了地主阶级利益服务的；一切政治设施的最后目的，都是为了巩固和加强封建统治。这样，也就不难理解在封建官僚的压迫、奴役下，广大人民对于比较清明、宽大、廉洁政治的向往，对于能够采取一些措施，减轻人民负担，伸雪人民冤枉的好官的拥护了。”
    按照吴晗同志的“看法”，封建社会里被压迫被剥削的劳动人民，他们所“向往”的，只是“比较清明、宽大、廉洁的政治”；他们所能采取的办法，只是“拥护”一些“清官”，请求“清官”替他们“减轻”一些“负担”，“伸雪”一些“冤枉”，如此等等。除此而外，他们再也没有什么别的“向往”了！在封建地主阶级的奴役压迫之下，广大人民是否“向往”革命斗争呢？在这篇《自我批评》里没有正面回答，但实际上他是反复说明了的。
    他说：“这个地区的阶级矛盾是农民对乡官的矛盾，不是一般的农民对地主的矛盾；这个地区的阶级斗争是农民对乡官的阶级斗争。”这就是说，在吴晗同志看来，一般的地主与农民是没有矛盾的，农民对他们也不作斗争的，只有那些乡官，才与农民有矛盾，农民才与他们作“斗争”。凡是有一点常识的人都知道，在封建社会里，地主阶级和农民阶级的矛盾，是最根本的矛盾。吴晗同志既然取消了这个最根本的矛盾，那末还有什么阶级矛盾，革命斗争可言呢？
    那末，农民又是怎样同乡官作斗争的呢？吴晗同志说：“告状也是阶级斗争的一种低级形式”。正是从这一点出发，在《海瑞罢官》这个剧本里，洪阿兰一家虽有三代仇冤，但她所想到的复仇办法，只是“告状”“告状”，别无其它“向往”。而“告状”要能获胜，又非要“清官”出场帮忙不可了。在吴晗同志的“理论”和《海瑞罢官》这个作品中，好象的确有这样的“清官”，他虽然也是封建官僚的一员，但在农民和乡官的“阶级斗争”（告状）中，却能站在农民一边，减轻农民的负担，伸雪农民的冤枉。既然有这样的“清官”、“好官”，不言而喻，广大人民又何必“向往”革命斗争呢！
    吴晗同志抹杀了封建社会的基本矛盾，又创造了进行阶级斗争的奇妙方案，这就无怪乎他在其它的文章中，对历史上的农民起义和向往革命要深恶而痛绝了。他说：“要强调农民起义的正义性，就非相对地刻划封建统治阶级的罪恶活动不可”，对封建社会“比较全盛的时代的领导人物不写或很少描写，于是，历史的光明面丧失了，写在书上的尽是这个皇朝如何坏，农民起义推翻了它，另一皇朝起来了，又如何坏，农民起义又推翻了它，一片打倒声，历史几乎成为漆黑一团，灰溜溜的”。吴晗同志在这里坦率地表达了自己的历史观点和阶级感情。他对历史上的阶级斗争——农民起义是那样的痛恨，而对历史上的那些帝王将相，“清官”和“好皇帝”则是那样的深爱。
    我认为吴晗同志这一点坦白性，是应该肯定的。的确，在今天，谁有这样的勇气，“敢”为早已被推翻了的封建地主阶级抱“不平”呢？谁“敢”把封建统治阶级的头子——帝王将相公然看作是历史的“光明面”，而把推动历史前进的伟大的农民起义运动，咒骂为“漆黑一团”呢？看来，吴晗同志确实“属于敢的一流”！他不仅“敢”于这样看，“敢”于这样说，而且到现在还“敢”于这样坚持。可惜的是，他所坚持的不是正确的东西，而是十分错误的观点。
    奇谈怪论之二是说：“对于能够采取一些措施，减轻人民负担，伸雪人民冤枉的……好官，人民作了鉴定，叫作‘青天’。……但是，也决不可以由此得出结论，以为‘青天’就是站在人民立场的政治家。不是的，恰恰相反，他们都是为封建统治阶级利益服务的官僚，在这一点上，也和当时其他封建官僚一样，是和人民对立的。”
    吴晗同志的这一段话，表面上看来，好象是说，历史上人民对“好官”的“鉴定”是缺乏阶级分析的，我们应该坚持阶级观点。但实际上，吴晗同志的意思并非如此。第一，吴晗同志在许多地方反复说明历史上人民把某些“清官”叫做“青天”的现象，并不是为了否定这种说法，对这种现象作认真的阶级分析；相反，却是为了反复地肯定它。第二，吴晗同志自己也是把这些“清官”叫作“青天”的。就在《况钟与周忱》这篇文章里，他还专门立了《况青天》这一节，并说：“苏州人民好容易有了一个青天，松了一口气”等等。因为在吴晗同志看来，劳动人民根本不“向往”革命，只“向往”“清明、宽大、廉洁”的政治，也就是说他们只配有被压迫、被剥削的命运。那末，既然出现了这样的“在不损害封建统治阶级的根本利益前提下，有意识地办了一些好事”的“清官”，既然承蒙他们对劳动人民“宽大”了一下，劳动人民怎么能不对他们“感恩戴德”呢？怎么能不喊出“青天大老爷公侯万代”，也即是“清官万岁”的口号呢？
    不错，历史上曾经有过这种现象，即劳动人民对“清官”存在着幻想，把他们叫作“青天”。这是劳动人民长期以来受了封建统治阶级的欺骗，受了封建意识形态毒害的结果。那末，自谓站稳了阶级立场的吴晗同志，在今天就不应该狂热地宣扬“清官”，宣扬“青天”的作用了。可是恰恰相反，他对况钟和周忱备极赞扬，认为他们“在历史上也就应该是被肯定的，值得纪念的，在某些方面，还是值得今天学习的人物”。他对海瑞，则更是崇拜得五体投地，歌颂他是农民的“救星”，祝愿他“公侯万代”、“万家生佛把香烧”。吴晗同志对这些“清官”的评价，早把马克思主义的阶级观点抛到九霄云外去了，而代替它的，是十足的封建统治阶级的观点！吴晗同志这样宣扬“清官”，究竟是受了“欺骗”呢，还是为了欺骗呢？自称早在十五年前就已经“克服了超阶级观点”的吴晗同志，说是受了“欺骗”是没有人相信的。那末，剩下来的也只能是为了欺骗了。——不管是“受了”还是“为了”，总之，它继续在对人们起欺骗作用，这是可以肯定的。
    吴晗同志说：“决不可以由此得出结论，以为‘青天’就是站在人民立场的政治家”。但是，究竟是谁“得出”这样“结论”的呢？难道不正是他自己吗？一九五九年九月，他在《论海瑞》里说：“清官”海瑞，“是深深得到广大人民爱戴的言行一致的政治家。他站在农民和市民的立场上向封建官僚、大地主斗争了一生”。说：“对农民和地主打官司的案件，他是站在农民一边的。海知县、海都堂是当时被压抑、被欺侮、被冤屈人们的救星。”“他一生处处事事为百姓设想，为民谋利”。隔了一年，一九六○年九月，他笔锋一转，却教训人们说“决不可以由此得出这样的“结论”。而过了不到两个月，他在《海瑞罢官》里，实际上又把海瑞描写成为人民的救星了。这前后三篇文章，两种对立的观点，究竟哪一个是代表吴晗同志的观点的呢？现在据说是“诚心诚意”写的这篇“自我批评”，孤零零地端出一九六○年的那段话来，说“这个看法我基本上还没有什么改变”。那末，请问吴晗同志，你对《论海瑞》和《海瑞罢官》里的观点有没有改变呢？你现在端出来的这个“看法”难道又是正确的吗？在学术讨论中，允许坚持自己的这种或那种观点；但决不能一个篮子里放着两种货色，用得着什么就取出什么来。这种狡诈的手法，究竟是“诚心诚意”的“自我批评”呢，还是“假心假意”的“自我批评”呢？
    奇谈怪论之三是说：这些“清官”、“好官”，“有意识地办了一些好事。这些好事是和封建统治阶级的长远利益一致的，也是和被压迫被剥削的广大人民当前利益一致的”。
    按照吴晗同志的这个“看法”，则“统治阶级的长远利益”，也就是“被压迫被剥削的广大人民”的“当前利益”。两者是“一致”的，没有矛盾的。什么是“封建统治阶级的长远利益”呢？当然是长远地剥削和统治劳动人民。在阶级社会里，从来没有一个统治阶级不是希望自己的统治万世永固的，也从来没有一个统治阶级不是把自己的统治建立在阶级压迫和阶级剥削的基础上的。他们的利益同被压迫被剥削阶级的利益怎么能是“一致”的呢？认为它们有“一致”的利益，就是把两个对立阶级在阶级利益上的尖锐冲突完全抽掉了，从而阶级的矛盾就不存在了，两个对立阶级就可以互相合作，互相拥抱了！吴晗同志在这里，不分明是在宣扬阶级调和论吗？不错，在阶级社会里，当统治阶级在政治上或经济上作某些改良的时候，对当时的劳动人民是可以带来某些好处的。但是，某些好处不等于广大人民的“当前利益”。这终究不过是劳动人民多被剥削一点和少被剥削一点的区别而已，它无论如何总不会改变劳动人民被剥削被压迫的命运，因此两个对立阶级在阶级利益上的冲突不可能取消，不可能“一致”。吴晗同志大肆宣扬这种两个对立阶级利益的“一致”论，请问，在今天国际国内的阶级斗争中，它又是与哪一个阶级的利益“一致”，与哪一种思想“一致”的呢？
    作了以上分析以后，就可以看出，对吴晗同志来说，他所坚持的确实是十分重要的。这些都是他的“理论”的“精华”所在，是轻易不能“改变”的，他早在一九六一年二月（《海瑞罢官》演出不久）就声明过，看了这个戏“会有许多人不满意”，“但是，决不认错，因为无错可认”，“决不能算错误”。为什么要如此自持呢，因为这个“看法”一“改变”，《海瑞罢官》岂不就失去了“理论”的支柱？“大丈夫”岂不就成了“小丈夫”？“真男子”岂不就成了“假男子”？所以坚持这个“看法”，也就是坚持《海瑞罢官》。《海瑞罢官》不是根本不写劳动人民的阶级斗争，而只写他们“对于比较清明、宽大、廉洁政治的向往”吗？不是根本不写他们对革命的“向往”，而只写他们对“清官”的“拥护”吗？《海瑞罢官》里的劳动人民不是一个劲地在给海瑞“作鉴定”，叫他作“海青天”、“海父”、“海龙王”吗？《海瑞罢官》里的海瑞不正是为着“封建统治阶级的长远利益”而斗争，同时又完全与“被压迫被剥削的广大人民”的“当前利益一致的”吗？吴晗同志既然坚持他对“清官”的“这个看法”“没有什么改变”，也就等于他对《海瑞罢官》的“看法”“没有什么改变”。批评由你批评，“好官”我自“颂”之！什么“使我认识了错误”云云，都不过是聊蔽“风雨”的门面话而已！
