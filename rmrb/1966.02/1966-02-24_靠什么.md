　　Relying on What
    The fact that Comrade Jiao Yulu led the people of Lankao to subdue the "three harms" of waterlogging, windblown sand, and saline-alkali soil raises an important question for us: How should county committee leaders correctly understand and handle the relationship between people and things, between the subjective and the objective? How can the backward conditions of a region be rapidly changed?
    Comrades in Binhai said that in the past they believed their county's conditions were poor, production was backward, there were no advanced experiences to summarize, and no models to learn from, and thus they were blinded by "backwardness," unable to see the infinite power in the masses; Comrades in Yanjin said that in the past they were also shackled by being a "heavily disaster-stricken county," believing that the development of agricultural production was unlikely to move ahead of fraternal counties, and they dared not strive for the top; Comrades in Su County were also once disarmed ideologically by "difficulties," not "knowing the difficulties and advancing," but wanting to "retreat from difficulties"... Although the manifestations were different, the root was the same: They did not well appreciate the urgent demands of the broad masses to change nature and overcome disasters, nor did they see the great power of the masses, but regarded objective conditions as static and unchanging, and were overwhelmed by temporary difficulties in material aspects.
    Whether to believe in the masses or not, whether to rely on the masses or not, this is a principle issue that we Communists must correctly resolve. In any work, we must believe in the masses and rely on the masses. We must understand that the revolutionary cause is the cause of the masses liberating themselves. For comrades working in backward areas and disaster areas, understanding this is of even greater practical significance. Only by fully believing in the power of the masses can we truly solve the problem of how to lead the masses. If we do not believe in the masses, only believe in ourselves, or even believe neither in the power of the masses nor in ourselves, then no work can be done well.

　　靠什么
    焦裕禄同志领导兰考人民，制服内涝、风沙、盐碱“三害”的事实，给我们提出了一个重要问题：县委领导应当怎样正确认识和处理人和物、主观和客观的关系？怎样迅速改变一个地区的落后面貌？
    滨海的同志说，过去他们认为本县条件差，生产落后，没有什么先进经验可以总结，没有什么标兵可以学习，因而被“落后”蒙住了眼，看不到群众中的无穷力量；延津的同志说，过去也被“重灾县”束缚了手脚，认为农业生产的发展很难走到兄弟县的前边，不敢力争上游；宿县的同志也曾经被“困难”解除了思想武装，不是“知难而进”，而想“畏难而退”……表现虽然不同，根子却是一个：没有很好地体会广大群众改变自然、战胜灾害的迫切要求，也没有看到群众的伟大力量，而把客观条件看成是静止不变的，被物质方面的暂时困难压倒了。
    相信不相信群众，依靠不依靠群众，这是我们共产党人必须正确解决的一个原则问题。在任何工作中，我们都必须相信群众，依靠群众。我们必须懂得革命事业是群众自己解放自己的事业。对于在后进地区和灾区工作的同志们来说，理解这一点，更具有极大的现实意义。只有充分相信群众的力量，才能真正解决如何领导群众的问题。如果不相信群众，只相信自己，甚至既不相信群众力量，也不相信自己，那么，什么工作都是无法做好的。
