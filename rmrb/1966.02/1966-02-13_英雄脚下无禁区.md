    Heroic Feet Know No Forbidden Zones
    I have always yearned to visit the Liberation Army soldiers who infiltrated the heart of the invading American troops in South Vietnam to strike at the enemy. How did they heroically and cleverly carry out close-range surprise attacks on the American aggressors? And how did they turn the American troops' rear base of comfort into a front line?
    My wish finally came true. In a village in the Central Highlands, I met the "Divine Soldiers" who raided the American military base in Pleiku on February 7, 1965.
    He is an ordinary soldier in the Southern Liberation Army named Dam, about thirty years old. He was carrying an American Thompson submachine gun – spoils of war from the attack on the Khanh Son stronghold. His coppery face and deep-set, gleaming eyes showed intelligence and courage.
    "That was not long ago," Dam said, taking out an American lighter, lighting a native cigarette, and taking a deep drag, "The higher-ups gave our unit a difficult but glorious combat mission - to attack the American military base. You know, as soon as I heard it was attacking American aggressors, my comrades and I were really overjoyed."
    Since the failure of the US imperialists' special warfare, they have been sending troops and expanding bases to the South Vietnamese battlefield on a large scale. The Pleiku US military base has suddenly become lively, with American planes flying in and out one after another. Thousands of American troops are stationed here, and they and the puppet troops set out from here to "sweep" the mountains; American planes take off from here every day to frantically bomb the people in the mountainous areas.
    The battle order was issued. Dam and his comrades set out with hatred for the US imperialists' expanded war of aggression and the determination to fight a decisive battle. They first established an advance base in the depths of the dense forest.
    This area is a primitive dense forest, with no inhabitants and no rivers. The soldiers first encountered the difficulty of getting drinking water. Whenever it rained, the soldiers took off their shirts and stood in the rain, collecting water drop by drop with raincloths. Sometimes, when the collected water was used up, they would pick one or two sour leaves and chew them in their mouths to quench their thirst. There were no vegetables, so they ate cold rice balls with salt. Life was difficult, but none of the soldiers thought about it. What they thought about was: "This is the first battle against the American troops, and we must complete the task."
    The subtropical forest climate is somewhat special. As soon as the sun touches the ground, it gets dark. Suddenly, thousands of stars faintly twinkle. Led by their commander, Dam and his comrades marched towards the American military base. They walked where there were no roads, taking a step and then falling to the ground, and then feeling their way forward. Sometimes they lay on the ground for a long time, and the cold air from the ground and the cold wind from above rushed at them, making their calves numb. Sometimes, crawling forward, gravel scratched their feet, and wild thorns cut their skin, but none of the soldiers cared about these things. They successfully bypassed the first line of defense around the base – the heavily guarded strategic hamlet defense circle.
    At this time, American helicopters appeared, and a string of flares hung in the air, illuminating the surrounding area in a snowy white light. In the distance, the "clanking" sound of American armored vehicles patrolling could be heard. Dam and the soldiers quickly jumped into the bushes, and then slightly raised their heads, taking advantage of the light from the flares to observe the front. Ah! What a large open space! There are no trees, no crops here, just a patch of low weeds, completely bare. Around the open space, guard towers and bunkers, like ferocious monsters, stood guard menacingly. As soon as the flares went out, the powerful beams of searchlights on the guard towers shot out and then extinguished in an instant. Behind the open space are several rows of concertina wire, with trenches dug in front and behind the wire. Mines are buried everywhere inside and outside the trenches, and trip flares and signal flares are hanging on the barbed wire. Such fortifications, not to mention in the dark of night, are difficult to cross even in broad daylight.
    Faced with such a situation, what should be done? Dam and the soldiers' answer was: "We must resolutely feel our way forward, and victory will come if we find a way through." Hatred for US imperialism, firm confidence in the revolutionary cause, and loyalty to the Party and the people inspired the soldiers' firm will and courage in times of difficulty. Every step forward carried the danger of stepping on a mine. The soldiers lay on the ground, feeling the ground with their hands, taking a step and then moving forward. No one knew how many mines they had avoided, but the soldiers broke through the forbidden zone and found a breakthrough.
    The base's heartland was now in sight. All kinds of aircraft were lined up on the tarmac, looking like black turtles in the dark night. The lights in the American soldiers' dormitories were still shining, and the sound of the patrolling soldiers' leather shoes hitting the road could be heard.
    Dam, he was born into a poor peasant family in Gam? County, M Commune, Kon Tum Province. His father was forced to death by imperialist lackeys because of debt, and he had no food or clothing since he was a child, growing up in hardship. After joining the revolution, like all soldiers of the Southern Liberation Army, he cultivated a red heart for the revolution and the people and a solid set of combat skills. This was the first time he had personally attacked the American bandits, and a surge of heat surged through his heart, almost uncontrollable.
    Before long, the commander relayed the battle order to the soldiers: to attack the American military base. Dam was assigned as the leader of the main attack group, with the task of attacking the American officers' quarters and an airport near the quarters. They followed the familiar path, taking advantage of the darkness, avoiding the patrols, and going straight to the American officers' quarters.
    It was already midnight, and the lights were still on in the American officers' quarters. Dam nimbly sneaked into the first house, but there was no American soldier in the house. Dam quickly retreated and jumped into the second house, but still could not find any American soldiers. All the way to the fifth house, the American soldiers were still nowhere to be seen. Time passed second by second, and large beads of sweat flowed down Dam's broad forehead. He was secretly anxious. Dam had carried out many attacks on the enemy, and none had been unsuccessful, but this time he encountered an unexpected situation. He thought thousands of thoughts: the comrades are waiting for the explosion that I will set off, this is the signal for the general attack!
    When Dam thought of the commander's instructions and expectations for him, he encouraged himself like this: "No, I can't detonate the bomb if I can't find the American soldiers, no matter how great the difficulty, I must overcome it." He searched the surrounding area with the sharp eyes of a hunter, and saw a house standing dimly in front of him, and immediately quickly interspersed towards it, approaching the house. Looking into the window, there it was, an American soldier lying in a tent on a soft bed in a large room. A mixture of anger and excitement filled his heart for a moment. Dam skillfully set the explosives, held his breath, and lit the fuse. With a muffled roar like thunder, the base trembled. The American aggressors' quarters were instantly submerged and lifted into the sky in the midst of smoke and gunpowder.
    The explosion that Dam set off was the signal for the general attack. As soon as the Liberation Army soldiers ambushing in the fields around the military base heard the explosion, they rushed out like a whirlwind. The Liberation Army artillery accurately fired batches of shells at the American barracks, the shells streaking across the night sky, emitting an awe-inspiring scream. In an instant, the base's airport, American barracks, bunkers, and guard towers, one after another, resounded with explosions and gunfire, smoke and gunpowder filled the sky, and the sound shook the earth.
    After Dam exploded the American officers' quarters, he immediately carried out the second task with his comrades: to attack an airport. At this time, three helicopters took off into the air in the midst of the chaos and flew low over Dam's head. The helicopters sprayed out tongues of fire, and tracer bullets dragged a string of bright tails flying around Dam, stirring up gusts of smoke and dust. Taking advantage of the blackness, they jumped and jumped through the curtain woven by smoke and rain of bullets, and plugged into the airport. No enemies appeared at this airport, and the enemies in the distant guard towers did not dare to come out. There were fourteen American planes parked at the airport, the helicopter propellers drooping. At this time, the scenes of American planes dropping napalm, burning crops and orchards, and villagers being bombed, all flashed through Dam's mind one by one. A surge of hatred and anger suddenly surged into his heart.
    "We see each other every day, but we have never been so close. Now, they are in my palm. Comrades, avenge the people, and fight hard!" Dam stared at the enemy planes with bright eyes and spoke in a loud voice.
    Dam and the soldiers, one in front and one behind, picked up submachine guns, pulled open the grenade pins, and fiercely attacked the planes one by one. The plane was hit, immediately caught fire and exploded, and the fragments flew in all directions in the fire. In a short while, all fourteen enemy planes were destroyed, and the clumsy fuselage fell crookedly on the tarmac.
    "You probably already know the results of that battle." After Dam told the full results of the battle, he suddenly discovered something miraculous and blurted out: "I didn't expect that one of my bombs would also exchange for an American colonel!"
    "US imperialism thought that by increasing troops and relying on 'air superiority' it could scare us. Our answer to it is that we have no planes, no anti-aircraft guns, but we still have ways to strike at the American flying bandits. There are no forbidden zones under our feet, and wherever the American troops who are invading us are, we will definitely be able to reach them." Dam laughed loudly. His laughter was so hearty and heroic, making people think of rumbling spring thunder, and one victory after another.

    英雄脚下无禁区
    我一直渴望着，能够访问潜进侵越美军心窝里打击敌人的解放军战士。他们是怎样英勇机智近距离奇袭美国侵略军的呢？他们又怎样把美军的后方安乐窝变成了前线的呢？
    我的愿望终于实现了。在西原高原的一个村落里，我会见了一九六五年二月七日奇袭波来古美军基地的“神兵”。
    他是南方解放军中一个普通战士，名叫达姆，近三十岁样子。他提着一支美式汤姆枪——攻打寒信据点的战利品。他那古铜色的脸额上配着一双深凹的闪闪发光的眼睛，显示出机灵和勇敢。
    “那是不久之前。”达姆掏出美军的打火机，点燃了土烟，猛吸了一口说：“上级把一个艰巨而光荣的战斗任务——攻打美军基地交给了我们部队。你是知道的，一听说是打美国侵略军，我和同志们一样，真的心里乐开了花。”
    自从美帝国主义特种战争失败以来，大肆向南越战场遣兵调将，扩充基地，波来古美军基地也顿时热闹起来，美国飞机一批接一批飞来飞去。上千美军驻在这里，他们和伪军一起从这里出发进山“扫荡”；美国飞机每天从这里起飞对山区人民狂轰滥炸。
    战斗令下达了。达姆和战友们怀着对美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的仇恨和决战决胜的心情出发了。他们先在密林深处建立了前哨基地。
    这一带是原始密林，没有人烟，没有河流。战士们首先遇到吃水的困难。一遇下雨，战士们赤膊淋在雨里，用雨布一滴滴地积水。有时积水用完了，他们就摘一两片酸树叶，放在嘴里嚼嚼解渴。没有菜，盐巴下冷饭团。生活上是困难的，但是战士们谁也没有去想它，他们所想的：“这次是首战美军，必须完成任务。”
    亚热带的林间气候有些特殊，太阳刚贴地皮，天色就黑下来了。顿时，万点星星隐隐闪烁。达姆和战友在指挥员带领下，向美军基地挺进。他们走没有路的路，走一程，扑倒在地，再摸一程。有时长时间的趴在地上，地里的寒气，头上的冷风，嗖嗖地直扑过来，小腿麻木了。有时，匍匐前进，碎石擦破脚板，野刺划破了皮肤，但战士们谁也没有顾上这些。他们成功地绕过了基地外围第一道防线——警卫森严的战略村防卫圈。
    这时出现了美军直升飞机，一串照明弹挂在空中，把四野照得雪白。远处传来巡逻的美军装甲车“轧轧”声。达姆和战士们迅速跃进草丛里，又微微抬起头，趁照明弹的亮光观察前方。啊！好大的一片开阔地！这里没有树，没有庄稼，一片贴地的杂草，光荡荡。开阔地四周，岗楼、碉堡，象一个个凶恶的怪物，虎视眈眈。照明弹刚熄，岗楼上探照灯的强大光柱，倏时射出，倏时熄灭。开阔地后边是几道蛇腹形的铁丝网，网前网后挖有堑壕。壕里壕外遍地埋着地雷，铁丝网上吊着挂雷、讯号雷。这样的防卫工事，别说是漆黑的夜里，就是大白天也是难于越过的。
    面临着这样的情况，应该如何办呢？达姆和战士们的回答是一个：“坚决摸过去，摸出一条道来就是胜利。”对美帝国主义的仇恨，对革命事业的坚定信心，对党对人民的忠诚，鼓舞着战士们在困难时刻的坚定意志和勇气。每前进一步都有触雷的危险，战士们伏在地上，用双手摸着地皮，摸一步，前进一步。谁也不知道避过了多少地雷，战士们踏破禁区，找出了突破口。
    眼前是基地腹地了。停机坪上排列着各种各样的飞机，在黑夜中活象一个个黑乌龟。美军宿舍的灯火还闪闪发亮，巡逻兵皮鞋打在路上的咯咯声也听到了。
    达姆，他出身昆嵩省加姆?县M乡贫苦农家，他的父亲给帝国主义走狗逼债气死，从小没吃没穿，苦水里泡大的。参加革命后，他象所有南方解放军战士一样，炼出了一颗为革命为人民的红心和一套过硬的作战本领。这次是他第一次亲手征讨美国贼，心里汹涌着一股热流，几乎难于控制。
    过了不久，指挥员向战士们传达了进攻美军基地的战斗命令。达姆担任主攻组长，任务是进攻美军军官住房和住房附近的一个飞机场。他们沿着摸熟的老路，趁着夜色，躲过巡逻，直插美军军官住房。
    这时已经是午夜，美军军官住房里还亮着灯火。达姆只身敏捷地潜进了第一幢住房，但屋里没有一个美军。达姆急速退出，跃进第二幢房，又没有找到美军。一直到第五幢住房，还是不见美军。时间一秒一秒地过去，大粒大粒的汗珠顺着达姆宽阔的脸额淌下来，他暗暗着急了。达姆多次潜击敌人，没有一次不成功的，但这次却遇到了没有料到的情况。他思绪千万：同志们正在等待自己发出的爆炸声，这是总攻击的讯号啊！
    达姆想到指挥员对自己的指示和期望时，他这样鼓励自己：“不，找不到美军不能爆炸，有多大的困难，我一定要克服。”他用猎人般锐利的双眼向四野搜索了一遍，见到前面隐立着住房，立即快步穿插过去，靠近了住房。往窗户里一瞧，有了，一个很大的房间里的软床上的帐子里躺着美军。一时怒火和兴奋交织心田。达姆熟练地安好炸药，屏着呼吸，点燃了引火线。轰然一声闷雷般的巨响，震得基地打颤。美国侵略者的住房顿时淹没，在硝烟弥漫之中，掀上了天。
    达姆点燃的爆炸声是总攻击的讯号。埋伏在军事基地四野地里的解放军战士一听到爆炸声，象一阵旋风似的一齐飞奔出来。解放军炮兵把成批的炮弹准确地射向美军营房，炮弹掠过夜空，发出威气逼人的尖啸声。顷刻间，基地的飞机场、美军营房、碉堡、岗楼，一处接一处连续响起了爆炸声、枪击声，烟硝冲天，响声震地。
    达姆爆炸了美军军官住房之后，立刻和战友们一起执行第二个任务：进攻一处飞机场。此时，三架直升飞机在混乱中腾空升起，朝达姆头顶低飞过来。直升飞机喷出一道道火舌，曳光弹拖着一串串光亮的尾巴在达姆四周乱飞，掀起一阵阵烟雾和尘土。他们趁着黑色一跃一跳地穿过硝烟和弹雨织成的帷幕，插进机场。这处机场上没有出现敌人，远处岗楼上的敌人也不敢出来。机场上停着十四架美军飞机，直升飞机螺旋桨耷拉着。这时，过去那种种美军飞机扔凝固汽油弹、庄稼和果园在燃烧、乡亲们被炸死的景象，一一在达姆脑海里闪出。一股仇恨怒火霎时涌上心头。
    “我们天天见，但从来也没有离得这样近，现在，可在我手掌里了。同志们，为人民报仇恨，狠狠地打！”达姆目光炯炯地盯着敌机，发出宏亮的声音。
    达姆和战士们一前一后，端起冲锋枪，拉开手榴弹弹栓，对准飞机挨个猛烈地打击。飞机中弹，当即着火爆炸，碎片在火光中四处纷飞。不一会儿，十四架敌机全部炸毁，粗笨的机身东歪西倒地瘫在停机坪上了。
    “那次战斗结果，你大概已经知道了。”达姆说了全部战果后，突然发现什么奇迹似地脱口而出：“我没有想到，我的一颗炸弹还换了一个美军上校军官哩。”
    “美帝国主义满以为靠增兵、靠‘空中优势’能吓倒我们。我们回答它的是我们没有飞机，没有高射炮，但我们照样有办法打击美国飞贼。我们的脚下无禁区，侵略我们的美军在哪里，我们就一定能打到哪里。”达姆大笑起来。他的笑声是那样爽朗豪迈，使人想起了隆隆春雷，想起一个接一个的胜利的春雷。
