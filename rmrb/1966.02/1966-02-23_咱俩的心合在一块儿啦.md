　　“Our Hearts are United”
　　Old Poor Peasant Xiao Weifen, Chengguan Commune, Lao Hanling Brigade
    As soon as Secretary Jiao arrived in Lao Hanling, he first came to my cowshed and asked me, "Old Xiao! What do you think we can do to change the face of Lao Hanling?" I said, "Secretary Jiao, it's easy to change; just plant peanuts and tung trees; with good grass, livestock can also be developed!" But in those years, peanuts and tung trees were practically extinct in Lao Hanling. How could we plant them? I asked if the state could lend us some money to buy peanut seeds and tung tree seedlings from outside. Secretary Jiao repeatedly said, "Okay, that can be done." I was also happy to say, "As long as you say it can be done, I guarantee we can develop livestock."
    I also said, "To develop livestock, the keepers have to take more care of the animals! Give a reward for calves born, and the livestock will develop quickly!" Secretary Jiao was happy to hear this and said, "Old Xiao, you've thought of something great! How about having the captain, the keeper, and the herder sign a three-way contract?" When I heard this, I thought, ah, Secretary Jiao's thoughts are exactly the same as mine, our hearts are united!
    After we finished talking about peanuts and livestock, we talked about planting tung trees in the sandy land. There were no seedlings, so I said, let's go to Lao Wangzhuang's Jiahe Beach to get tung tree roots to sprout tung seedlings. That night, the more we talked, the more in tune we were. I don't know how long it was before Secretary Jiao raised his hand and looked at it, saying, "Oh, it's getting late!" I quickly said, "You should rest, and I have to feed the livestock!" But Secretary Jiao said, let's talk a little longer. We started talking again under the oil lamp!
    When he wasn't in Lao Hanling, I missed him; when I didn't go, he missed me too. He came to my cowshed three times, and each time we talked until midnight. Once, Secretary Jiao came to see me again. I hurriedly asked him to sit down and drink a bowl of boiled water, but when I looked up, ah, Secretary Jiao had lost so much weight? Why did he look so unwell? Was he sick? But he insisted he wasn't.
    More than a month later, someone brought a message saying that Secretary Jiao had died! Alas! Secretary Jiao was truly a good secretary to us poor and lower-middle peasants! A county Party secretary who didn't care about the taste of his food, who didn't cut corners when working, and we were so in tune, why didn't I go to Zhengzhou to see him when he was sick! I wanted to go, but it was far away, and I couldn't leave because of these livestock in the team! Thinking of this, I feel really sad!
    The members of Lao Hanling are doing as Secretary Jiao directed, planting large plots of peanuts and rows of tung trees in the sandy land. Now the tung trees are growing very well, the large ones as thick as bowls. In these two years, the lives of our commune members have been better. We don't eat unified sales grain and even sell grain to the state. In our twelfth production team alone, livestock has grown from three and a half to fourteen. Looking at these tung trees that cover the sky and the earth, and eating the steamed buns in my bowl, I just think of Secretary Jiao. If Secretary Jiao hadn't died, how good it would be for him to come to Lao Hanling to see!
    One night, I felt like Secretary Jiao came to the cowshed and sat under that oil lamp, and we were talking clearly! The livestock stirred and woke me up! Looking east and west, there was no one. Where was Secretary Jiao? No response when I called, couldn't see him! That night, I shed a lot of tears. Secretary Jiao, you were only in your forties, is that old? I'm seventy-six this year, I wish I could die in your place! Secretary Jiao! If I can't talk to you, it would be good to see you!
    But crying doesn't solve anything. Secretary Jiao said that me feeding the livestock is a revolution, I believe what the Party says, I'll do whatever the Party directs, I want to carry the revolution through to the end, feed the production team's livestock well, and completely change the face of our Lankao County.

　　“咱俩的心合在一块儿啦”
　　城关公社老韩陵大队老贫农　萧位芬
    焦书记一来老韩陵，就先到俺牛屋里，问俺：“老萧哪！你看咋能改变老韩陵的面貌呢？”我说：“焦书记，要改变也容易，只要种花生、桐树；有了好草，牲口也能发展啦！”可那几年，花生、桐树在老韩陵绝断了，咋种呢？我问，国家能不能给贷点儿款，到外边去买点花生种、桐树苗？焦书记连连说：“中啊，这事儿能办到。”我也喜得说：“只要你说能办，俺就保证能发展牲口。”
    我又说：“要发展牲口，还得饲养员对牲口多操心哩！下了牛犊能给点奖，牲口发展就快啦！”焦书记一听，高兴得说：“老萧哪，你想得怪到哩！你说让队长、饲养员、鞭把订个三角合同，中不中？”我一听，噫，焦书记的心思同俺的心思一模一样，咱俩的心算合在一块儿啦！
    俺俩说罢花生、牲口的事儿，又说沙地种桐树。没树苗，我说，上老王庄夹河滩弄桐树根发桐苗。那晚，俺俩越谈越合心。不知过了多会儿，焦书记抬手一看说：“唷，下一点啦！”我忙说：“你该歇了，俺也得喂牲口了！”可焦书记说，再谈一会儿吧。俺俩又在油灯下谈开啦！
    平日里，他不来老韩陵，俺就念他；我不去，他也念俺。他光到俺牛屋就有三趟，每趟都谈到半夜。有一回，焦书记又来看俺，俺忙让他坐下，喝碗开水，可抬头一看，噫，焦书记瘦多啦？气色咋不对啊？是病了吧？可他硬说没病。
    过了一个多月，有人带信来，说焦书记死了！唉！焦书记真是俺贫下中农的好书记啊！一个县委书记，人吃饭不讲味儿，做活不省事儿，咱俩又这么合心，他病了咋不去郑州瞧瞧他呢！俺心里也想去，可道远，队里有这些牲口不能脱身啊！一想起这，心里实在难过！
    老韩陵的社员们照着焦书记指的道去做，种上了大块大块花生，在沙地里种上了一行行桐树。眼下桐树长得很好，大的有碗口那么粗了。这二年，俺社员生活好过啦，不吃统销粮，还卖了粮食给国家。光俺十二生产队，三头半牲口就发展到十四头。看了这遮天荫地的桐树，吃着碗里的馍，俺心里就光想焦书记。焦书记要不死，到老韩陵来看看有多好啊！
    有一晚，俺觉着焦书记来牛屋啦，就坐在那盏油灯下，俺俩正清清亮亮谈话呢！牲口一忽啦，把我惊醒了！东瞅西瞅没一个人，焦书记在哪儿？叫不应，瞧不见哪！那晚，我可掉了不少泪。焦书记啊，你才四十多岁，能算大吗？我今年七十六了，我要能替你死了才好呢！焦书记啊！我不能同你谈话，能见见你也好啊！
    可光哭也不能办事。焦书记说，俺喂牲口这事儿就是革命，我就信党的话，党指到那儿，俺做到那儿，我要革命到底，把生产队的牲口喂得好好的，使俺兰考县的面貌彻底改变过来。
