    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 15th (via South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency) – Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, wrote a letter on February 14th to all commanders and fighters of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, warmly congratulating them on the 5th anniversary of the unification of the Liberation Armed Forces, and called on them to highly promote revolutionary heroism, raise the banner of decisive victory in competition, and resolutely strike and defeat the American robbers.

    The letter stated that in the past five years, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have rapidly grown from scattered guerrilla groups and self-defense forces, from small units dispersed in various localities, into a powerful revolutionary army with unified command and leadership, and have been tempered in the flames of the war of resistance. Recently, with a high determination to strike and defeat the American aggressors, you have enthusiastically launched a competition movement to eliminate the American robbers, giving the American imperialists a heavy blow, making the American-puppet troops increasingly deeply mired in the fire of the people's war in Vietnam.

    The letter said that the Liberation Armed Forces have not only eliminated many American-puppet troops, but also contributed to destroying "strategic hamlets," shrinking enemy-occupied areas, and consolidating and expanding the liberated areas, and have provided strong support for the political and military struggles of the masses.

    The letter said that the Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front has decided to award the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces the first-class "Copper Wall" Medal once again to commend this extremely heroic, loyal to the country, loyal to the people, revolutionary army that completes all tasks, overcomes all difficulties, and defeats all enemies.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 15th – Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, sent a telegram on February 14th to Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, warmly congratulating the 5th anniversary of the unification of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces.

    The telegram said that the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have grown rapidly in the torrent of revolution and have established brilliant military exploits. They have highly developed the power of people's war, defeated the American imperialists' "special war," and inflicted huge blows on the American expeditionary forces. The telegram pointed out that the increasingly significant military victories achieved by the army and people of South Vietnam powerfully prove that, under any circumstances, the heroic army and people of South Vietnam have sufficient strength to defeat the American aggressor robbers and their lackeys. The revolutionary war of the South Vietnamese people is invincible.

    The telegram concluded by saying that the people of North Vietnam are determined to learn from the tenacious fighting spirit of their flesh-and-blood compatriots in the South, fully support the revolutionary cause of the South, advance bravely shoulder to shoulder with the army and people of the South, and strive for the complete victory of the anti-American national salvation cause.
