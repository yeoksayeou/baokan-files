    According to Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 9th: The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland of Korea issued a statement on the 8th, strongly protesting the heinous activities of the Japanese and Park Chung-hee groups in attempting to change the nationality of Korean residents in Japan based on the illegal "Agreement on the Legal Status of Korean Residents in Japan."

    The statement said that recently, the Japanese government began so-called "acceptance of permanent residency applications," attempting to deprive Korean residents in Japan of their nationality of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and forcibly impose the so-called "South Korean" nationality on Korean citizens residing in Japan.

    The statement said that the heinous activities of the Japanese and Park Chung-hee groups are attempts to place all Korean residents in Japan under the double enslavement of Japanese militarism and the Park Chung-hee group, to arbitrarily use them, and to turn them into political victims of the Japanese and Park Chung-hee groups. In particular, they are attempting to turn Korean youths residing in Japan into cannon fodder for American imperialism's aggression in Asia.

    The statement expressed support for the struggle of Korean residents in Japan to refuse to "apply for permanent residency" and refuse to join "South Korean" nationality, and strongly demanded that the Japanese authorities immediately cease the criminal activity of so-called "accepting permanent residency applications" and unconditionally guarantee the democratic and national rights of Korean residents in Japan.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 8th: Representatives of twenty-three Japanese political parties and democratic organizations held a meeting in Tokyo on the 8th to protest the Sato government's unreasonable infringement of the democratic and national rights of Korean residents in Japan, and pointed out that the Sato government's infringement of the rights of Korean residents is an important part of implementing the "Japan-ROK Treaty."

    The meeting unanimously adopted a protest statement.

    据新华社平壤九日电　朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会八日发表声明，强烈抗议日本、朴正熙集团根据非法的“旅日朝侨法律地位的协定”企图改变旅日朝鲜侨民国籍的罪恶活动。
    声明说，最近日本政府开始所谓“接受永久居住权申请”业务，企图剥夺旅日朝鲜侨民的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国籍，而把所谓“韩国”（南朝鲜）国籍强加给旅日朝鲜公民。
    声明说，日本、朴正熙集团的罪恶活动，是妄图把全体旅日朝鲜侨民置于日本军国主义和朴正熙集团的双重奴役之下，随意驱使他们，把他们变成日本、朴正熙集团的政治牺牲品，特别是企图把旅居日本的朝鲜青年变成美帝国主义侵略亚洲的炮灰。
    声明表示支持旅日朝鲜侨民拒绝“申请永久居住权”和拒绝加入“韩国”国籍的斗争并强硬要求日本当局立即停止所谓“接受永久居住权申请”业务的犯罪活动，无条件地保障旅日朝鲜侨民的民主、民族权利。
    据新华社八日讯　东京消息：日本二十三个政党和民主团体的代表八日在东京举行会议，抗议佐藤政府无理侵犯旅日朝侨的民主和民族权利，并且指出佐藤政府侵犯朝鲜侨民的权利是实施“日韩条约”的一个重要部分。
    会议一致通过了抗议声明。
