    In August 1964, after graduating from high school, I responded to the Party's call and went to the Fuguan Brigade of Mengguan Commune in Huaxi District, Guiyang City, to participate in agricultural production. For more than a year, under the care and education of the Party organization, following Chairman Mao's teachings, I have combined with the poor and lower-middle peasants, which has enabled me to be tempered and accelerated my ideological remolding.
    When I first settled in Fuguan Brigade, I used my spare time to visit some poor and lower-middle peasants and conduct some social investigations. I learned that the production level here has greatly improved compared with before liberation. After the communization, many farmland capital construction projects were carried out, and the living standards of the commune members have greatly improved. At the same time, I also saw that the "poor and blank" appearance created by the old society in the countryside has not been completely changed, and arduous labor is still needed to build a new socialist countryside. I secretly made up my mind to contribute my strength to the construction of a new socialist countryside. I enthusiastically helped poor and lower-middle peasants in difficulty solve problems. However, at that time, my help to the poor and lower-middle peasants mainly came from a kind of sympathy, and I had not really established class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Later, I studied Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind. Chairman Mao said: "It is not easy to make friends with workers and peasants." "If you don't get rid of the old set and change to a proletarian world outlook, you will have different views, different standpoints, and different feelings from the workers and peasants, and you will be incompatible with the workers and peasants, and the workers and peasants will not tell them what is in their hearts." I felt that Chairman Mao's words were directed at me. I repeatedly examined myself and paid attention to establishing a proletarian world outlook.
    The poor and lower-middle peasant commune members cared about me very much and treated me like a relative. Their excellent qualities also infected me, and my thoughts and feelings gradually changed. I felt more and more that they were so kind and were role models for me to learn from. I was willing to approach them from the bottom of my heart and learn from them. In this way, they were willing to find me when they had something to do and tell me their innermost thoughts.
    In the countryside, I threw myself into the class struggle and the struggle between the two roads, and was tempered and educated, which made me understand that to love the poor and lower-middle peasants and to make revolution, I must resolutely draw a clear line between myself and the landlords, rich peasants, and all class enemies, and wage a resolute struggle against class enemies.
    After more than a year of training, I have made some progress in ideological remolding. But it is still far from the requirements of the Party. As the secretary of the brigade's Communist Youth League branch, I must lead the youth of the entire brigade to devote themselves to the three great revolutionary movements and better play a shock role. Therefore, the most important thing is to organize them to study Chairman Mao's works and truly master Mao Zedong Thought. I must take the lead in studying and applying it, and do what Chairman Mao said, like Comrade Wang Jie.

    和贫下中农结合  向贫下中农学习
    一九六四年八月，我在高中毕业以后，响应党的号召，到贵阳市花溪区孟关公社副关大队插队参加农业生产。一年多来，在党组织的关怀和教育下，遵循着毛主席的教导，与贫下中农结合，使自己受到了锻炼，加速了思想改造。
    刚到副关大队落户的时候，我利用休息时间走访了一些贫下中农，作了一些社会调查。了解到这里的生产水平比解放前有了很大提高，公社化以后，进行了许多项农田基本建设，社员生活水平大大提高了。同时，我也看到旧社会给农村造成的“一穷二白”面貌还没有彻底改变，要建设社会主义新农村，还要付出艰巨的劳动。我暗暗下定决心，有一分热发一分光，为建设社会主义新农村贡献出自己的力量。我热心帮助有困难的贫下中农解决问题。可是，那时候我帮助贫下中农，主要是出自一种同情，还不是真正与贫下中农建立了阶级感情。后来，我带着问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“和工人农民交朋友，这并不是一件容易的事情。”“如果不把过去的一套去掉，换一个无产阶级的世界观，就和工人农民的观点不同，立场不同，感情不同，就会同工人农民格格不入，工人农民也不会把心里的话向他们讲。”我感到毛主席的话就是针对我讲的。我反复检查，并注意使自己树立起无产阶级的世界观。
    贫下中农社员十分关心我，待我象亲人一样。他们的优秀品质，也感染了我，使我的思想感情逐渐发生了变化，越来越感到他们太可亲了，是我学习的榜样。我从内心里愿意接近他们，向他们学习。这样，他们有事也愿意找我，和我讲知心话。
    在农村，我投身到阶级斗争、两条道路斗争中，受到了锻炼和教育，使我懂得了要热爱贫下中农，要干革命，就必须坚决同地主、富农和一切阶级敌人划清界限，向阶级敌人作坚决的斗争。
    经过一年多的锻炼，我在思想改造上取得了一些进步。但离党的要求还很远。我是大队团支部书记，一定要带领好全大队的青年投入三大革命运动，更好地发挥突击作用。因此最重要的一条，就是要组织他们学习毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想真正学到手。我更要带头学，带头用，象王杰同志那样，毛主席怎样说的，我就怎样做。
