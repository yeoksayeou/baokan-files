    In the past, the county committee leadership did not emphasize politics, simply providing grain, loans, and relief supplies to impoverished areas, causing the masses to rely on the state for everything. Now, they are giving revolutionary thought, revolutionary work style, and revolutionary methods, which has changed the spiritual outlook of the people and the natural landscape.
    In the past, the county committee also proposed: in work, we must highlight politics and use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle; but in reality, we only paid attention to the economy, one-sidedly emphasizing the material interests of the masses. In the work of changing the impoverished face of the northwestern part of our county, this erroneous thinking was particularly evident. Materialism in command caused us to encounter many obstacles and suffer a lot of hardships in practice. Later, we gradually realized the great significance of what Chairman Mao said: that politics is the commander, the soul, and that "political work is the lifeblood of all economic work."
    The northwestern part of Fuxian County has seven communes, with a population and cultivated land accounting for one-third of the entire county. It has always been a poor area with backward politics and economics, and difficult production and living conditions. In the past, spontaneous capitalist tendencies were serious here, and the poor and lower-middle peasants were not strong enough. The natural conditions were also poor: the soil was barren, the sand dunes undulated, and the trees were sparse. Crop yields were very low, with an average yield of only a hundred or so catties per mu. Each person had three and a half mu of land, but they could not produce enough grain for themselves.
    In order to change this situation, the county committee did a lot of work, but mainly it was giving grain, giving loans, and giving relief supplies. The more we gave, the more some people relied on it. They said that our place was poor, with a weak foundation, and we had to rely on the state for grain, rely on loans for money, and rely on relief for difficulties. As a result, the county committee gave "three things" every year, and some people relied on "three things" every year. The more we gave, the less confident the masses became, and the more we gave, the heavier the burden on the state became.
    Since the spring of 1965, based on the instructions of the municipal committee and on the basis of summing up experiences and lessons, the county committee began by improving the county committee's guiding ideology, work style, and leadership methods. Taking class struggle and the struggle between the two roads as the key link, we used Mao Zedong Thought to arm the cadres and commune members, changing from giving grain, giving loans, and giving relief supplies to giving revolutionary thought, giving revolutionary work style, and giving revolutionary methods. This mobilized the positive factors of the people, changing the spiritual outlook and natural landscape of this area. Last year, there was a severe drought, but the seven communes still increased production, with the total grain output increasing by 12.5% compared to the previous year.
    In the work of transforming impoverished areas, what we have learned most deeply is:
    First, Chairman Mao's words have the highest prestige and the greatest power among the masses.
    Starting last spring, leading cadres of the county committee led work teams to the northwestern impoverished areas. This time, we did not bring grain, loans, or relief supplies, but brought Chairman Mao's writings, promoted Mao Zedong Thought, promoted the spirit of Dazhai, and boldly mobilized the masses. In response to the acute and complex class struggle and the struggle between the two roads here, and the lack of revolutionary enthusiasm among cadres and the masses, we organized the masses to study Chairman Mao's works. The county committee work team was a production commander, a fighter, and also a propagandist and study tutor of Chairman Mao's works. County and commune leaders personally lectured grassroots party members and poor and lower-middle peasants, quickly forming a surge of studying Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's words have the highest prestige and the greatest power. The masses studied Chairman Mao's works and were encouraged. Some people said: "Our poverty is not due to the sandy wasteland, but due to our thinking and enthusiasm. The people of the whole country listened to Chairman Mao's words and overthrew the three major enemies. If we listen to Chairman Mao's words, we can also overthrow the 'enemy' of wind and sand." In the past, people were afraid of hardship and fatigue and did not want to work on the construction projects supported by the state. Now, they are self-reliant and doing it themselves. In the past, they were timid and helpless in the face of wind and sand. Now, they have experience and methods to control wind and sand. In this area, there have been many vivid facts of changing the world, from which we have seen that the masses are the real masters of history and the real heroes. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can overcome any difficulty.
    Second, establishing the class advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants and vigorously grasping class struggle and the struggle between the two roads is a huge driving force for changing the backward situation.
    This area is economically poor, and the class struggle and the struggle between the two roads are acute and complex. Although we also acknowledge that there are classes and class struggle, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and the danger of capitalist restoration

    到底要给什么？
    过去县委领导不突出政治，对贫困地区单纯给粮、给贷款、给救济物资，群众因此事事靠国家；现在是给革命思想、给革命作风、给革命方法，人的精神面貌和自然面貌就起了变化
    过去县委也提出：在工作中要突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅；但实际上光注意经济，片面强调群众的物质利益。在改变我县西北部地区贫困面貌的工作中，这种错误思想影响尤为明显。物质挂帅，使我们在实践中碰了不少钉子，吃了不少苦头。以后我们才逐步地认识到毛主席说的政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的伟大意义。
    复县西北部有七个公社，人口和耕地占全县的三分之一，历来是个政治经济落后，生产生活困难的贫困地区。过去这里资本主义自发倾向严重，贫农下中农腰板不硬；自然条件也不好：土地瘠薄，沙丘起伏，树木稀少。农作物产量很低，平均每亩单产百十来斤，每人占有三亩半土地，粮食却不能自给。
    为了改变这种状况，县委做了许多工作，但主要地还是给粮食、给贷款、给救济物资，越给，有些人越靠，他们说我们这地方穷，底子薄，吃粮就得靠国家，用钱就得靠贷款，困难就得靠救济。结果是：县委年年“三给”，有些人也年年“三靠”。越给，群众的信心越不足，越给，国家背的包袱越沉重。
    一九六五年春天以来，县委根据市委指示，在总结经验教训的基础上，从改进县委的领导思想、领导作风和领导方法入手，以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，用毛泽东思想武装社队干部和社员群众，由给粮食、给贷款、给救济物资，变为给革命思想、给革命作风、给革命方法，从而调动了人的积极因素，使这个地方精神面貌和自然面貌发生了变化。去年干旱严重，七个公社仍社社增产，粮食总产量比前年增长百分之十二点五。
    在改造贫困地区的工作中，我们体会最深的是：
    第一，毛主席的话，在群众中威信最高，威力最大。
    从去年春天开始，县委领导干部带领工作队，来到西北贫困地区。这次下去，不是带粮食、贷款、救济物资，是带的毛主席著作，是宣传毛泽东思想，宣传大寨精神，放手发动群众。针对这里阶级斗争、两条道路斗争尖锐复杂，和干部、群众革命干劲不足的问题，组织群众学习毛主席著作。县委工作队是生产指挥员、战斗员，又是毛主席著作宣传员和学习辅导员。县、社领导干部亲自向基层党员和贫农下中农讲课，很快形成了学习毛主席著作热潮。毛主席的话，威信最高，威力最大。群众学了毛主席著作，鼓起了干劲。有人说：“咱们穷不是穷在沙荒上，是穷在思想上、干劲上。全国人民听毛主席的话，打倒了三大敌人，我们听毛主席话，也能打倒风沙‘敌人’”。过去国家支援这个地区的建设项目，人们怕苦怕累不想干，现在自力更生，自己动手干起来了；过去在风沙面前畏缩不前，束手无策，现在有经验有办法制服风沙了。就在这个地区，出现了许许多多改天换地的活生生的事实，我们从中看到了群众才是真正的历史主人，是真正的英雄。在共产党领导下，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，什么困难都可以征服。
    第二，树立贫农下中农阶级优势，狠抓阶级斗争和两条道路斗争，是改变落后面貌的巨大动力。
    这个地区经济贫困，阶级斗争和两条道路斗争尖锐复杂。虽然我们也承认：在过渡时期存在着阶级和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。但在实际工作中，我们对活生生的阶级斗争，往往视而不见、抓而不狠。群众的革命积极性和生产积极性受到挫伤。在这种情况下，不提高党员、干部的阶级觉悟，不树立贫农下中农的阶级优势，就不能制服敌人，就不能搞臭资本主义，就不能巩固集体经济和社会主义阵地，改变贫困落后面貌也只能是一句空话。毛泽东同志说：“政治是指阶级的政治、群众的政治。”离开了群众斗争，就无所谓政治。因此，我们集中力量组织干部、群众学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》和《湖南农民运动考察报告》，并进行了解放前后、合作化前后的对比教育。群众觉悟提高了，有些人检查了忘本思想，有的人表示决心革命到底。阶级敌人的一些阴谋活动，也被揭露出来，因此，有的社员这样说：“咱们穷，不是穷在沙荒上，是穷在坏魔上。坏魔斗不倒，沙治不好。”有的说：“这几年脑袋里没装个阶级斗争，只知干活、吃饭，不识好人坏人。”贫农下中农进一步组织起来了，狠狠打击了敌人的反动气焰，煞住了歪风，群众革命精神大振，集体生产积极性空前高涨。
    当然，在抓两条道路斗争中，领导干部需要深入基层，蹲点劳动，苦干实干，做大量艰苦的思想工作，才能把革命思想真正送到基层干部和群众中去。
    经过一年的实践，我们认识到，领导思想作风的好坏，标志着政治思想工作的好坏。只有领导的思想革命化，群众思想才能革命化。只有领导为了群众的利益，奋不顾身，英勇奋斗，才能带动群众排除万难，夺取胜利。
