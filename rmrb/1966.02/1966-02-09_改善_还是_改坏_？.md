    "Improvement" or "Deterioration"?
    The Coal Construction Store in Nanxian County, Hunan Province, had a backlog of substandard coal that was difficult to sell. Some comrades took advantage of the arrival of new coal and laid over 130 tons of substandard coal at the bottom, covering it with good coal, in order to mix it with the good coal and sell it. At the time, some comrades even considered this a good way to improve business management. Later, when the Socialist Education Movement began, the comrades involved examined this issue and concluded that it was the capitalist way of doing business at play. However, no action was taken afterward. Last April, when higher-level leaders emphasized highlighting politics in business management, some comrades raised this issue again, advocating for the substandard coal to be dug out. Some comrades, fearing trouble, actually disagreed, saying that what was done was done, and it shouldn't be done again. Guo Fuyuan, the deputy instructor of the store, believed that this was a major issue of whether to wage a struggle against capitalist business practices or to compromise with them, so he mobilized everyone to debate, unified understanding, and dug out the substandard coal.
    The business management of socialist enterprises must be improved. However, practices like the one in this store—using inferior goods to pass off as superior ones, and engaging in deception—are actually using capitalist practices to masquerade as socialist practices. This is clearly "deterioration," how can it be considered "improvement"? When this store finally dealt with this issue, they adhered to correcting mistakes when they are made, and resolutely refused to perpetuate errors, demonstrating the seriousness of socialist business practices with a firm stance and clear distinction between right and wrong.

### “改善”还是“改坏”？

    “改善”还是“改坏”？
    湖南省南县煤建商店曾经积压了一批次煤，不好处理。有的同志就趁新煤进店之机，把一百三十多吨次煤铺在底下，把好煤盖在上面，以便混在好煤里卖出去。当时，有的同志还认为这是改善经营管理的一个好办法。不久，社会主义教育运动开始，经办的同志检查了这个问题，认为这是资本主义经营作风在作祟。但是，事后并没有处理。去年四月，上级领导强调要在经营管理中突出政治，有的同志又提出了这个问题，主张把次煤挖出来。有的同志由于怕麻烦，竟然不同意，说过去的就算了，下不为例。商店副指导员郭复元同志认为，这是对资本主义经营作风进行斗争还是实行妥协的大问题，就发动大家辩论，统一了认识，挖出了次煤。
    社会主义企业的经营管理一定要改善。但是，象这个商店的做法：以次充好、弄虚作假，实际上是以资本主义作风冒充社会主义作风。这明明是“改坏”，哪能算“改善”呢？这个商店最后处理这个问题的时候，坚持有错纠错，决不将错就错，立场坚定，是非分明，显示了社会主义经营作风的严肃性。
