    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 22nd - The China Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble gave a performance on the evening of the 21st to express their regards to the People's Army air defense units and the broad masses of workers and staff defending the heroic capital city of Hanoi.
    When the song and dance ensemble arrived at a certain anti-aircraft artillery position, all the commanders and fighters of this unit lined up to welcome them, constantly shouting slogans such as "The unity and combat friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese people will last forever!" On the heroic position, the Chinese literary and artistic fighters enthusiastically performed the dance "Encounter at the Position," which praises the heroic Vietnamese military and civilians for fiercely attacking the American air pirates, as well as Vietnamese songs such as "Spring on the Battlefield" and "Quang Binh, My Homeland." Each program was filled with the profound friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people and expressed the Chinese people's deep respect for the heroic Vietnamese comrades fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle. A People's Army commander said excitedly, "Every dance and every song you perform is like a sharp shell hitting the head of our common enemy, American imperialism!"
    In order to express their respect for the Chinese comrades, the People's Army commander, on behalf of all the commanders and fighters of his unit, presented the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble with an aircraft model made from the wreckage of an American bandit aircraft shot down by their own hands. At this time, the Chinese and Vietnamese comrades sang the song "Liberate the South" in unison.
    On the same evening, the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble also gave performances for the workers and staff of units such as the Hanoi "Thong Nhat Match Factory" and the "Tien Bo Printing Factory," and each of their programs was warmly welcomed. Vietnamese workers and staff expressed their determination to use outstanding achievements of "producing while fighting" to thank the Chinese literary and artistic comrades for their sympathy and encouragement.
    On the evening of the 22nd, the Vietnam Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations held an artistic soiree to entertain the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble. Vietnamese artists performed the large-scale opera "Star Girl."
