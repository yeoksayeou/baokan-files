　　Syria Appoints New Head of State and Prime Minister
　　Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, February 26th: The Provisional Regional Leadership of the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, which has taken over the Syrian government, issued a public statement on the evening of the 25th, announcing the appointment of Nureddin al-Atassi as Head of State and Yusuf Zuayyin as Prime Minister.
    According to Damascus newspapers, the Provisional Regional Leadership decided that the Regional Leadership of the Syrian Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party has the power to appoint the Head of State, Prime Minister, and government ministers. The Head of State and Prime Minister will exercise legislative and executive powers during the transitional period before the promulgation of a constitution.
    Nureddin al-Atassi previously served as Vice-Chairman of the Syrian Presidential Council, and Yusuf Zuayyin served as Prime Minister in September of last year. They resigned at the end of last year due to the development of internal divisions within the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party.
    The Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave a note to the diplomatic missions in Damascus on the 25th, stating that the situation in Syria has returned to calm. The recent events are domestic and party actions, not a change of regime, and therefore do not require diplomatic recognition.
    The note stated that Syria's domestic and foreign policies and economic policies remain unchanged. The note expressed that Syria will fulfill all international responsibilities and expressed the hope to strengthen good relations with all friendly countries.

　　叙利亚任命新国家元首和总理
　　新华社大马士革二十六日电　已经接管叙利亚政府的阿拉伯复兴社会党临时地区领导二十五日晚发表公报，宣布任命努尔丁·阿塔西为国家元首，优素福·扎因为总理。
    据大马士革报纸报道，临时地区领导决定，叙利亚阿拉伯复兴社会党地区领导有权任命国家元首、总理和政府部长。国家元首和总理在颁布宪法之前的过渡时期里将行使立法权和行政权。
    努尔丁·阿塔西曾任叙利亚总统会议副主席，优素福·扎因在去年九月曾任总理。由于阿拉伯复兴社会党内部分歧的发展，他们在去年年底辞了职。
    叙利亚外交部二十五日给驻大马士革的各外交使团一份照会说，叙利亚局势已经恢复平静。最近的事件是国内的和党的行动，不是更换政权，因此不需要外交承认。
    照会说，叙利亚的国内外政策和经济政策不变。照会表示，叙利亚将履行一切国际责任，并表示希望加强同一切友好国家的良好关系。
