    According to Comrade Mao Zedong's ideology on party building, promoting the three great work styles of the Party is the most fundamental and important task in Party building.
    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out at the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "The Chinese Communist Party, armed with the theory and ideology of Marxism-Leninism, has generated a new work style among the Chinese people, which is mainly the style of combining theory with practice, the style of closely linking with the masses, and the style of self-criticism."
    According to Comrade Mao Zedong's line on party building, promoting the three great work styles and building a party armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, linked with the masses, and adopting self-criticism is our main magic weapon for defeating the enemy. Relying on this magic weapon is essential for carrying out the people's democratic revolution, as well as for carrying out the socialist revolution and socialist construction. This is the most precious experience of our revolution, and we should always remember it.
    Since the emergence of imperialism in the world, no country can carry out any anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution to the end without the leadership of such a genuine proletarian revolutionary party. Without the leadership of such a party, socialism is simply out of the question. If the party's leadership group degenerates and abandons these essential characteristics of a proletarian revolutionary party, then even in places where a vigorous proletarian revolution has taken place, even after the proletariat has seized power, the socialist fruits already obtained will be lost. We should also always remember these international lessons.
    The three great work styles are three prominent hallmarks that distinguish our Party from all bourgeois parties and revisionist parties. Between Marxists-Leninists and modern revisionists, there are principled differences in the line on party building, as in all other major issues. Vigorously promoting the three great work styles precisely highlights Comrade Mao Zedong's ideology on party building, highlights the Marxist-Leninist essence of our Party, and strictly distinguishes our Party from all bourgeois parties and revisionist parties.
    We must maintain a sober understanding of the environment surrounding our Party. Within our country, there is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road. This struggle of who will defeat whom must go through a very long historical period. In the world, there is a struggle between the revolutionary people of the world and imperialism headed by the United States, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionists. This struggle of who will defeat whom must also go through a very long historical period. This international and domestic, long-term and severe class struggle cannot but be reflected in our Party. The class enemies at home and abroad are trying to conquer us by force, and at the same time, they are also trying to "dissolve" us through peaceful evolution. In order to resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology and revisionist ideology, in order to shatter the enemy's "dissolution" policy and prevent "peaceful evolution," in order to ensure the Marxist-Leninist seriousness and purity of our Party, we must vigorously promote the Party's three great work styles.
    The three great work styles are our Party's fine traditions. This tradition was not easily formed; it is the result of the struggle between Comrade Mao Zedong's correct line and the right and "left" opportunist lines, especially the result of the rectification movement launched throughout the Party under the call of Comrade Mao Zedong from 1942 to 1944. The three great work styles were confirmed by the entire Party through long-term struggle practice, and they became a prevailing trend through the persistent efforts of all comrades in the Party. Twenty years have passed since Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the Party's historical experience at the Seventh National Congress of the Party and put forward the Party's three great work styles. During these twenty years, the Party's ranks have greatly developed. More than 90 percent of the members of our Party today joined the Party after this congress. In the future, more new revolutionaries will join our Party. Our Party members must inherit the Party's fine traditions well in order to become better revolutionary successors. Vigorously promoting the three great work styles means re-educating our Party members, so that they can further recognize this tradition of the Party, cherish it, inherit it, and carry it forward in the new historical conditions and in the new struggle practice.
    According to Comrade Mao Zedong's ideology on party building, vigorously promoting the Party's three great work styles is the most fundamental and important task in our Party's construction. All grassroots organizations of the Party should, without exception, carry out this task, strengthen the Party's grassroots construction, and establish and adhere to the system of studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, the system of linking with the masses, and the system of carrying out criticism and self-criticism.

    Turn all the revolutionary principles discussed by Comrade Mao Zedong into the common language of all Party members and make them sharp weapons in the hands of all Party members.
    A mass movement of studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works is rising throughout the country. This study movement has two distinct characteristics: one is broad mass character, and the other is clear purposefulness. Studying revolutionary theory is no longer just a matter for a few revolutionary cadres and revolutionary intellectuals. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are increasingly aware of the necessity of mastering revolutionary theory. More and more people among them are eagerly reading Comrade Mao Zedong's books and seeking truth in Comrade Mao Zedong's works, with various practical problems in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. Their sole purpose of learning is to guide practice, to use Mao Zedong Thought to answer questions, solve problems, transform themselves, and transform the world. So many people are participating in this study movement, learning so vividly, and applying it so well, which is beyond the expectations of many people. In fact, this is the inevitability of historical development. The revolutionary masses should not only master revolutionary theory but also be able to master revolutionary theory. This Marxist-Leninist principle is becoming a living reality. The superstition that workers, peasants, and soldiers cannot learn theory, which has shackled the masses, has been shattered. The fallacy of bourgeois academic tyrants that workers, peasants, and soldiers are not worthy of learning theory has been overthrown. The emergence of this study movement is an unprecedented new atmosphere shown by the people of our country in the great Mao Zedong era. It is the fundamental method for further revolutionizing the broad masses of our country and a great driving force for accelerating the development of our country's socialist revolution and construction.
    The development of this study movement is very uneven. The general rule is: wherever the Party's grassroots organizations attach importance to studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works and can truly learn and apply them flexibly, the mass movement of studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works will definitely be carried out well, and the three great revolutionary movements will also definitely be carried out well. Conversely, wherever the Party's grassroots organizations do not pay attention to studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and there is no strong atmosphere of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought flexibly within the Party, the movement of studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works among the masses will be difficult to carry out, and the three great revolutionary movements will be difficult to achieve results. This fact shows that only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought as a theoretical weapon can the Party's grassroots organizations fully realize their leading role among the masses; only by arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought and combining revolutionary theory with revolutionary practice can the broad masses of Party members and the masses realize the task of transforming society, transforming nature, and transforming their own subjective world.
    Not long ago, under the guidance of the Party Central Committee's Mao Zedong Selected Works Publishing Committee, the A and B editions of the "Selected Readings from Mao Zedong's Works" have been published. These were edited to meet the needs of general cadres and workers and peasants in studying Mao Zedong Thought. The dozens of articles collected in "Selected Readings from Mao Zedong's Works" are all the most basic, most commonly used, and easiest to understand articles. This is an extremely favorable condition for the vast number of grassroots Party members and cadres to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works. The Party's grassroots organizations in rural areas, factories, organs, schools, and all other units should universally establish a system for studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and conscientiously organize Party members and cadres to study, according to the principle proposed by Comrade Lin Biao of "studying with problems, learning and applying flexibly, combining learning with application, learning what is urgently needed first, and seeing immediate results." For illiterate Party members, the methods of "reading," "listening," and "memorizing" can also be used to learn. The branch should strengthen leadership, inspection, and supervision of the study, and the higher-level Party committee should also provide regular specific guidance. Turn all the revolutionary principles discussed in Comrade Mao Zedong's works into the common language of all Party members, make them sharp weapons in the hands of all Party members, make Mao Zedong Thought the guide for the thoughts and actions of all Party members, and enable every Party member to fully and consciously become a good soldier in studying Mao Zedong Thought, publicizing Mao Zedong Thought, and implementing Mao Zedong Thought. This is a fundamental event in the Party's ideological construction. If this major event is accomplished and done well, the combat effectiveness of our Party will inevitably be raised to an unprecedented height.

    Follow the mass line, unite more than 95 percent of the masses closely around the Party, and realize the Third Five-Year Plan.
    Believing in the masses, respecting the masses, relying on the masses, firmly standing on the side of the vast majority of the people, and serving the vast majority of the masses are the most fundamental mass viewpoint that Comrade Mao Zedong has always taught every Party organization and Party member to establish. Chairman Mao said that the people are the real heroes, the motive force for creating world history, and a copper wall and iron bastion that no force can break. Revolution relies on the masses, construction also relies on the masses, and it will be difficult to move an inch without the masses. The entire task of our Party is to serve the people. The basic working method of our Party is to follow the mass line. The strength of our Party lies in close ties with the masses.
    A Party member who does not publicize, investigate, inquire, or care when he sees the masses, does not study the opinions and requests of the masses, does not think of ways to solve them, does not reflect them to the Party organization, does not struggle against phenomena that harm the interests of the masses, and does not use his own exemplary actions to drive the masses forward is an ineffective Party member. A Party branch that does not educate and organize Party members to do mass work, does not make specific demands on Party members, does not check their activities among the masses, does not listen to the opinions of the masses, does not publicize the Party's propositions to the masses, does not pay attention to promoting the revolutionization of the masses step by step through its own work, does not lead the masses forward in accordance with the Party's line and policies, and does not accept the supervision of the masses is an ineffective Party branch.
    The Party's grassroots organizations should establish and improve the system of linking with the masses. The main focus should be on four things: First, educate Party members and cadres to persist in participating in collective productive labor. Second, grasp political democracy, production democracy, financial democracy, and military democracy. Organize the masses to supervise cadres and supervise Party members. Third, organize Party members to carry out ideological and political work among the masses. Fourth, care about the vital interests of the masses, give play to the exemplary role of Party members, and educate and organize Party members to learn from Lei Feng, learn from Wang Jie, do revolution, and do good deeds.
    Whether in war conditions or in a peaceful environment, whether in rural areas or in cities, our Party has extremely rich experience in mobilizing the masses and linking with the masses. This experience is extremely valuable. The series of mass work experiences should be summarized, so that scattered and unsystematic experience can be given rationality and comprehensiveness, widely disseminated, and continuously developed, in order to solve various practical problems often encountered in mass work. The Party's leading organs should do this, and grassroots organizations should also do this. The grassroots are the place where experience is produced and also the place where experience is used, so the focus should be on the grassroots. Leading cadres of leading organs should help grassroots cadres do this work well through staying at selected spots.
    Relying on the working class, poor and lower-middle

    大兴党的三大作风，加强党的基层建设
    乔明甫
    按照毛泽东同志的建党思想，大兴党的三大作风，是党的建设上一项最根本最重要的任务
    毛泽东同志在党的第七次全国代表大会上指出：“以马克思列宁主义的理论思想武装起来的中国共产党，在中国人民中产生了新的工作作风，这主要的就是理论和实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风以及自我批评的作风。”
    按照毛泽东同志的建党路线，大兴三大作风，建设一个有马克思列宁主义的理论武装的、联系人民群众的、采取自我批评方法的党，这是我们战胜敌人的主要法宝。进行人民民主革命必须靠这个法宝，进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设也必须靠这个法宝。这是我国革命的最宝贵的经验，我们应当永远记住。
    自从世界上出现了帝国主义以后，任何国家，如果没有这样一个真正的无产阶级革命党的领导，一切反帝反封建的民主革命都不可能进行到底。没有这样一个党的领导，社会主义就根本无从谈起。如果党的领导集团蜕化变质，抛弃了无产阶级革命党的这些必须具备的特性，那末，即使在进行过轰轰烈烈的无产阶级大革命的地方，即使在无产阶级夺得了政权以后，已经到手的社会主义果实也会丧失殆尽。这些国际的教训，我们也应当永远记住。
    三大作风是我们党区别于一切资产阶级党、修正主义党的三个显著的标志。在马克思列宁主义者同现代修正主义者之间，在建党路线上，也同在其他一切重大问题上一样，存在着原则分歧。大兴三大作风，正是突出毛泽东同志的建党思想，突出我们党的马克思列宁主义的本质，使我们党同一切资产阶级党、修正主义党严格地划清界线。
    必须对我们党的周围环境保持清醒的认识。在我们国内，存在着无产阶级同资产阶级、社会主义道路同资本主义道路的斗争。这场谁战胜谁的斗争，必须经历一个很长的历史时期。在全世界，存在着世界革命人民同以美国为首的帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义者的斗争。这场谁战胜谁的斗争，也必须经历一个很长的历史时期。这种国际的和国内的、长期的和严重的阶级斗争，不可能不反映到我们党内来。国内外的阶级敌人，力图用武力来征服我们，同时，还力图用和平演变的手段来“溶化”我们。为了抵制资产阶级思想、修正主义思想的侵蚀，为了粉碎敌人的“溶化”政策和防止“和平演变”，为了确保我们党的马克思列宁主义的严肃性和纯洁性，必须大兴党的三大作风。
    三大作风是我们党的优良传统。这个传统，形成不易，是毛泽东同志的正确路线同右的和“左”的机会主义路线斗争的结果，特别是一九四二年到一九四四年在毛泽东同志号召下在全党范围内开展的整风运动的结果。三大作风，是经过长期的斗争实践才为全党所确认的，是经过全党同志的坚持努力才蔚然成风的。从毛泽东同志在党的第七次全国代表大会上总结了党的历史经验，提出了党的三大作风以后，已经过去了整整二十年。这二十年中间，党的队伍大大地发展了。现在我们党的百分之九十以上的党员，是在这次大会以后入党的。今后，将会有更多的新的革命者参加到我们党内来。我们的党员必须很好地继承党的优良传统，才能成为比较好的革命接班人。大兴三大作风，就是重新教育我们的党员，使他们在新的历史条件下，在新的斗争实践中，进一步认识党的这个传统，珍重它，继承它，发扬它。
    按照毛泽东同志的建党思想，大兴党的三大作风，是我们党的建设上的一项最根本、最重要的任务。党的一切基层组织，都应该无例外地执行这项任务，加强党的基层建设，把学习毛泽东同志著作的制度、联系群众的制度和开展批评和自我批评的制度建立起来，坚持下去。
    把毛泽东同志所讲的一切革命道理变成全体党员的共同语言，成为全体党员手中的锐利武器
    一个广大群众性的学习毛泽东同志著作的运动正在全国范围内兴起。这个学习运动，有两个鲜明的特点：一个是广泛的群众性，一个是明确的目的性。学习革命理论，不仅仅是少数革命干部和革命知识分子的事情了。广大的工农兵群众，越来越觉悟到非掌握革命的理论不可。他们中间已经有越来越多的人，带着阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中的各种实际问题，如饥如渴地读毛泽东同志的书，到毛泽东同志的著作中找真理。他们学习的唯一目的又是为了指导实践，为了用毛泽东思想来回答问题，解决问题，改造自己，改造世界。参加这个学习运动的人这样多，学得这样活，用得这样好，是出乎许多人的意料之外的。其实这是历史发展的必然性。革命的群众不仅应该掌握革命的理论，而且能够掌握革命的理论，这条马克思列宁主义的原理，正在成为活生生的现实。工农兵不能学理论这种束缚群众的迷信被打破了。工农兵不配学理论这种资产阶级学阀老爷的谬论被推翻了。这个学习运动的出现，是我国人民在伟大的毛泽东时代所表现出来的史无前例的新气象，是我国广大群众进一步革命化的根本方法。是加速我国社会主义革命和建设发展的伟大动力。
    这个学习运动的发展是很不平衡的。一般的规律是：凡是党的基层组织重视学习毛泽东同志的著作并且能够做到活学活用的地方，群众性的学习毛泽东著作的运动就一定开展得好，三大革命运动也一定开展得好。反过来说，凡是党的基层组织不注意学习毛泽东同志的著作，党内没有浓厚的活学活用毛泽东思想的风气，群众中的学习毛泽东著作的运动就难以开展起来，三大革命运动就难以搞出成绩。这个事实说明：党的基层组织，只有掌握了毛泽东思想这个理论武器，才能够在群众中充分地实现自己的领导作用；广大的党员和群众，只有用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，把革命的理论和革命的实践结合起来，才能实现改造社会、改造自然和改造自己主观世界的任务。
    不久以前，在党中央毛泽东选集出版委员会的指导下，《毛泽东著作选读》的甲种本和乙种本已经出版了。这是为了适应一般干部和工农群众学习毛泽东思想的需要而编辑的。收集在《毛泽东著作选读》中的几十篇文章，都是最基础、最常用、最好懂的文章。这对于广大基层党员、干部学习毛泽东同志著作是一个极为有利的条件。农村、工厂、机关、学校和其他一切单位中的党的基层组织，应当普遍地建立学习毛泽东同志著作的制度，按照林彪同志提出的“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”的原则，认真组织党员、干部学习。对不识字的党员，也可以采取“念”、“听”、“记”的办法来学。支部要加强对学习的领导、检查和督促，上级党委也要经常给予具体指导。把毛泽东同志著作中所讲的一切革命道理变成全体党员的共同语言，变成为全体党员手中锐利的武器，使毛泽东思想成为指导全体党员的思想和行动的指南，使每一个党员都能够充分自觉地成为学习毛泽东思想、宣传毛泽东思想、执行毛泽东思想的好战士。这是党的思想建设上的一件根本大事。把这件大事办成了，办好了，我们党的战斗力就必将提高到空前未有的高度。
    走好群众路线，把百分之九十五以上的群众紧紧地团结在党的周围，实现第三个五年计划
    相信群众，尊重群众，依靠群众，坚定地站在绝大多数人民群众一边，为绝大多数群众服务，这是毛泽东同志历来教导我们每个党的组织和党员必须树立的最根本的群众观点。毛主席说，人民群众是真正的英雄，是创造世界历史的动力，是什么力量也打不破的铜墙铁壁。搞革命要靠群众，搞建设也要靠群众，离开了群众就会寸步难行。我们党的全部任务是为人民服务。我们党的基本的工作方法是走群众路线。我们党的力量就在于密切联系群众。
    一个党员，如果见了群众，不宣传，不调查，不询问，不关心，听到群众的意见和要求不研究，不想办法解决，不向党的组织反映，不对危害群众利益的现象作斗争，不以自己的模范行动来带动群众前进，就是一个不起作用的党员。一个党支部，如果不教育和组织党员去做群众工作，不向党员提出具体的要求，不检查他们在群众中活动的情况，不听取群众的意见，不向群众宣传党的主张，不注意通过自己的工作来一步一步地促进群众革命化，不按照党的路线和政策来领导群众前进，不接受群众的监督，就是一个不起作用的党支部。
    党的基层组织，应当建立和健全联系群众的制度。主要应当抓好四件事：第一，教育党员干部坚持参加集体生产劳动。第二，抓政治民主，生产民主，财务民主，军事民主。组织群众，监督干部，监督党员。第三，组织党员对群众进行思想政治工作。第四，关心群众的切身利益，发挥党员的模范作用，教育和组织党员学雷锋，学王杰，干革命，办好事。
    无论在战争条件下还是在和平环境中，无论在农村还是在城市，我们党都有极其丰富的发动群众联系群众的经验。这些经验，极为可贵。应当把一系列的群众工作的经验总结起来，使分散的和无系统的经验带上条理性和综合性，广为传播，不断发展，用以解决在群众工作中常常遇到的各种实际问题。这件事，党的领导机关要做，基层组织也要做。基层是出经验的地方，也是用经验的地方，重点应当放在基层。领导机关的领导干部要通过蹲点，帮助基层干部做好这件工作。
    依靠工人阶级、贫下中农、革命干部、革命知识分子和其他革命分子，把百分之九十五以上的群众紧紧地团结在党的周围，这是胜利实现第三个五年计划的最重要的保证，也是粉碎美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的最重要的保证。有了这个保证，我们就一定无敌于天下。
    经常开展批评和自我批评，健全组织生活，使党组织保持坚强的生命力
    毛泽东同志告诉我们，党内批评是坚强党的组织、增加党的战斗力的武器。有了这个马克思列宁主义的武器，我们就能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风。
    没有批评和自我批评，或者不经常运用这个武器，党内就会没有民主，没有纪律，没有原则，没有团结，没有生气勃勃的党的生活。就不能正确地总结和正确地接受经验教训，就不能教育党员和教育群众，就不能有所创造，有所前进。
    党的基层组织一定要象毛泽东同志所说的天天洗脸、天天扫地一样，把开展批评和自我批评的组织生活制度健全起来，做到经常化。党员大会也好，支部委员会也好，党小组会也好，都有两种开法。一种是按照党性原则开，一种是用自由主义的态度开。用自由主义的态度开，没有批评和自我批评，会开得再多，也起不到组织生活应有的作用；按照党性原则，正确地开展批评和自我批评才能过好组织生活，达到团结和进步的目的。党的基层组织应该坚持这样的组织生活。
    近几年来，不少基层组织采取了一种“小整风”的办法：每年抽出一定时间，针对党员中存在的一些带普遍性的问题，学习毛泽东同志的有关著作和党的有关文件，联系实际，检查思想，总结工作，开展批评和自我批评，坚持真理，修正错误，并且鉴定党员。有些基层组织在进行“小整风”时，还吸收一部分工人代表或者贫下中农代表参加，征求他们的意见，听取他们的批评。把党内的批评自我批评同党外的群众监督结合起来，这是一个好办法，值得推广。
    在开展批评自我批评当中，支部委员特别是支部书记，要带头作出榜样，虚心倾听党员群众的意见，鼓励和支持来自下面的一切批评和建议，支部书记的这种民主作风，对活跃党内民主生活，养成民主空气有着重要作用。党内批评和自我批评搞好了，组织生活制度健全了，党组织就有坚强的生命力，就不怕任何政治微生物的腐蚀侵袭了。
    党的基层组织要具体地教育和组织党员大兴三大作风，建立三项制度
    党的基层建设，工作很多，要从千头万绪中理出一个要领来。大兴三大作风，建立三项制度，就是党的基层建设的要领。三大作风包括三个原则：一个是处理理论和实践的关系的原则，一个是处理党和群众的关系的原则，一个是处理正确和错误的关系的原则。这是党的每一个基层组织天天都要遇到、必须正确处理的原则问题。加强党的基层建设，不抓三大作风不行，不认真经常地抓三大作风也不行。抓住了这个要领，就可以把党的基层建设的全盘工作带起来，就可以把党的基层组织建设成为以毛泽东思想武装起来的、密切联系群众的、能够开展批评和自我批评的、坚决贯彻执行党的路线和政策的、勇于克服各种困难的战斗堡垒。
    大兴三大作风，执行三项制度，要注意内容，把工作越做越活，不要搞形式主义。要认真，不要敷衍。要坚持，不要一阵风。
    党的基层组织要具体地教育和组织党员大兴三大作风。党的领导机关要负责指导，加强检查。
    党的一切基层组织都应当大兴三大作风。正在开展社会主义教育运动的地方，尤其要大兴三大作风。社会主义教育运动，是一次重新教育人改造人的伟大革命运动，是亿万群众的革命运动。从党的建设的角度来说，也就是用毛泽东思想重新教育党员的运动，加强党和群众的联系的运动，在放手发动群众的基础上通过批评和自我批评整顿党的基层组织的运动。开展社会主义教育运动，应该为大兴党的三大作风打下一个好的基础。党的领导机关派出的工作队，应该为基层组织留下一个好的作风，并且通过扎扎实实的思想工作和组织工作，在提高广大党员的自觉性的基础上，把党的三大作风兴起来，传开去。
    让我们全党同志更高地举起毛泽东同志的建党思想的伟大红旗，大兴三大作风，为建设一个更加光荣、更加伟大、更加正确的党而斗争！
