　　Adding Fuel to the Fire
    The Indian famine is severe, and the New Delhi ruling clique is at a loss, only wanting to use empty words to fill the people's stomachs. The masses in various places, having reached the limit of their patience, have risen up to launch anti-hunger struggles, and it has imposed barbaric suppression, arresting thousands of people in Calcutta alone. This perverse act by the Indian reactionaries cannot but further intensify the already very acute social contradictions.
    The Indian ruling clique pursues a reactionary domestic and foreign policy, which has made a mess of India's political economy, plunging the broad masses of people into misery. The masses want food and want to live, so they will naturally rise up to oppose the ruling authorities' starvation policies. What problem can arresting people solve? Those who want food still need to eat, and those who want to live still need to live. The Indian authorities' brutal suppression is nothing but adding fuel to the fire. The masses, who have been further enraged, have begun to use violent actions, opening granaries to distribute grain and burning down reactionary police camps. These rapidly developing events reflect that the Indian people's anti-hunger struggle is moving towards a new high tide.
    There is an old Chinese saying: "The officials force the people to revolt." In human history, all resistance struggles of the oppressed people are forced by the reactionary rulers. Reactionary rulers can sometimes use violent means to temporarily suppress the people's struggle, but, in the final analysis, all kinds of persecution and suppression can only promote more extensive and more intense struggles by the people. This is a historical law, and there can be no exception in India.

　　火上加油
    印度粮荒严重，新德里统治集团束手无策，净是想拿一些空话来填饱人民的肚子。各地群众忍无可忍，起来展开反饥饿斗争，它就施加蛮横的镇压，单是在加尔各答一地，就逮捕了几千人。印度反动派的这种倒行逆施，不能不使本来已经十分尖锐的社会矛盾更加激化。
    印度统治集团奉行反动的内外政策，把印度的政治经济弄得一团糟，使广大人民陷于水深火热之中。人民群众要吃饭，要活命，就自然要起来反对统治当局的饥饿政策，抓人能够解决什么问题呢？要吃饭的人还是得吃饭，要活命的人还是得活命。印度当局的残暴镇压不过是往火里加油罢了。被更加激怒了的群众已开始用暴力的行动，开仓分粮，焚烧反动警察营帐。这些急剧发展的事态，反映出了印度人民的反饥饿斗争正在走向新的高潮。
    中国有句老话说：“官逼民反”。在人类历史上，一切被压迫人民的反抗斗争，都是反动统治者逼出来的。反动统治者有时候可以用暴力手段把人民的斗争暂时镇压下去，但是，归根结底，种种迫害和镇压只能促使人民更广泛、更剧烈的斗争。这是一条历史规律，在印度也是不可能有例外的。
