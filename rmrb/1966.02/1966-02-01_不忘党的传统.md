    Never Forget the Party's Tradition
    Hu Jianhua, Party General Branch Secretary of Chongqing Nan'an Leather Factory
    For more than a decade, the most fundamental reason why our factory has been able to develop from nothing to something and from small to large is our reliance on the Party's work and the continuous improvement of the ideological awareness of the workers and masses.
    Every old worker in our factory has their own history of blood and tears. They often say that without the Party, without Chairman Mao, there would be no Nan'an Leather Factory. They have particularly deep feelings for the Party. They all have the innate qualities of diligence, thrift, and hard work. However, shoemaking has always been a decentralized and technologically backward handicraft industry. To cultivate these handicraft workers, who have long been in the position of small producers, into a revolutionary industrial working class, into conscious revolutionaries, who can withstand the tests of hardship and difficulties, as well as the tests of wealth and honor, and never change their color, we must strengthen regular ideological and political work.
    In the past few years, the development path of our factory has not been smooth. The spontaneous forces of small producers have sometimes risen, and various non-proletarian thoughts have constantly corroded us. Whenever we encounter such problems, we always keep two things in mind: first, we study Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies and guidelines with problems in mind, and use Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's principles as the yardstick to observe and measure everything, distinguish right from wrong, and maintain a clear mind; second, we inspire workers to recall and compare, think about the path we have taken, never forget our roots, and look at the great prospects of socialism and communism, clarifying the glorious responsibility shouldered by the working class. Facts have proven that as long as we improve the ideological awareness of workers politically, all problems can be easily solved.
    With the gradual development of factory production, a tendency to compare extravagance and living standards with others has emerged among a small number of workers. They believe that "the factory's conditions are better, so it's time to build some decent family dormitories," and "the factory has a lot of visitors, so the hardwood chairs in the office should be replaced." Some people are extravagant in production, indifferent to machines running idle, and more usable leather scraps are found in the leather waste piles. The Party organization realized that the essence of these "small things" reflects the fundamental issue of whether or not we will change our color after becoming rich. We organized all factory workers to study Chairman Mao's works, making them realize that our country still needs to undergo decades of hard struggle to become prosperous and strong. Although we are now richer than in the past, we have only taken the first step in a long march, and we are still far from our grand goals.
    From the second half of 1963 to the first half of 1964, our factory was successively rated as an advanced unit in running enterprises diligently and thriftily by Chongqing Municipality, Sichuan Province, and the Ministry of Light Industry. Product quality was also among the best. The higher authorities praised us repeatedly, and some fraternal units came to exchange experiences. Faced with honor, some workers once developed a sense of pride and complacency, and the pace of progress slowed down. In the leather industry competition in Chongqing in May 1964, the quality of our factory's leather shoes suddenly dropped from first place to last place. But some people were still unconvinced, unable to see their own shortcomings, and unwilling to admit backwardness. The Party General Branch discovered this problem and immediately organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's instructions on opposing pride, complacency, and stagnation, and to examine their own thinking in light of these instructions. At the same time, we organized everyone to visit fraternal factories, comparing indicators one by one to identify gaps. In this way, the workers realized that as long as their thinking relaxed, they would fall behind others. A slight difference in thinking will lead to a much greater difference in the quality of shoes. In the past, some people didn't care about small bright spots on the shoes. Through study, they realized that these were not scars on the shoes, but "scars" in their thinking. After healing this scar in thinking, our shoes were once again rated as number one.
    Years of practice have made us realize that the key to running a socialist enterprise well is the revolutionization of the workforce, first and foremost the revolutionization of the leadership core. The most fundamental way to cultivate workers' revolutionary consciousness is to study Chairman Mao's works extensively and arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. The Party General Branch Committee of the factory has insisted on spending two half-days each week studying Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies and guidelines since 1958. Later, we mobilized all cadres and workers in the factory to participate in such regular learning activities. Every step we take, we check against what Chairman Mao said, what the Party's policies stipulate, and what we did in the past. In this way, we can see the light in times of difficulty and see our own shortcomings in times of success. Now, more than 20 study groups have been established in the factory, and everyone comes to work early every day to collectively read Chairman Mao's works for half an hour, which has greatly changed the mental outlook of the workers. After studying Chairman's works, many workers have not only improved their ideological understanding but also actively helped their surrounding partners to progress, and a lively new situation of "everyone doing ideological work" has initially formed in the factory.

    不忘党的传统
    重庆南岸皮革厂党总支书记  胡建华
    十多年来，我们工厂能够从无到有、从小到大地发展起来，最根本的一条是依靠党的工作，不断提高职工群众的思想觉悟。
    我们厂里的老工人，每个人都有自己的血泪史。他们常常说，没有党，没有毛主席，就没有我们南岸皮革厂。他们对党怀有特别深厚的感情。他们都有着勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的本色。但是，制鞋历来是一项分散、技术落后的手工业，要将这些长期处于小生产者地位的手工业工人，培养成为一支革命化的产业工人，成为自觉的革命者，既经得起艰苦和困难的考验，也经得起富裕和荣誉的考验，永不变色，还必须加强经常性的思想政治工作。
    几年来，我们厂的发展道路并不是平坦的。小生产者的自发势力有时有所抬头，各式各样的非无产阶级思想不断地向我们进行腐蚀。每遇到这样一些问题的时候，我们总是牢记了两条：一是带着问题学习毛主席著作和党的政策方针，用毛主席思想和党的原则的尺度去观察衡量每件事物，明辨是非，保持头脑清醒；二是启发职工回忆对比，想想我们走过的道路，永不忘本；看看社会主义和共产主义的远大前景，明确工人阶级肩负的光荣重担。事实证明，只要从政治上去提高职工的思想觉悟，一切问题都不难解决。
    随着工厂生产的逐步发展，少数职工中出现了与别人比阔气、比生活待遇的倾向。他们认为“厂里条件好了，该盖些象样的家属宿舍了”，“厂里人来客往，办公室里的硬木椅子该换一下了”；有人在生产上大手大脚，对机器开空车满不在乎，皮渣堆里可用的皮角也多了起来。党组织意识到从这些“小事”中反映出本质问题，就是富了以后，变不变色。我们组织全厂职工学习毛主席著作，使他们认识到我们国家要富强起来，还需要进行几十年的艰苦奋斗。现在虽然比过去富裕了，还只是万里长征走了第一步，距离远大目标还远得很。
    一九六三年下半年到一九六四年上半年，我们厂先后被重庆市、四川省和轻工业部评为勤俭办企业的先进单位，产品质量也名列前茅。上级三番五次表扬，一些兄弟单位也前来交流经验。在荣誉面前，一部分职工一度产生了骄傲自满情绪，前进的步子慢了。一九六四年五月重庆市皮革行业评比时，我们厂的皮鞋质量一下从第一名下降到倒数第一名。但有的人还不服气，看不到自己的缺点，不承认落后。党总支发现了这个问题，立即组织大家学习毛主席关于反对骄傲自满、故步自封的指示，对照自己，检查思想。同时，组织大家去兄弟厂参观，一个指标、一个指标对比，找出差距。这样一来，职工们才认识到，只要自己思想一松，就会落在别人后面。思想差一分，鞋子质量就要差得更多。有些人过去对鞋子上的一些小亮疤毫不在乎。通过学习，他们认识到这不是鞋上的疤，而是思想上的“疤”。在治好这个思想上的疤以后，我们的鞋子又被评为第一名。
    几年来的实践，使我们认识到，办好一个社会主义企业，关键是职工队伍的革命化，首先是领导核心的革命化。培养职工的革命意识，最根本的是大学毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来武装职工的头脑。厂的党总支委员会，从一九五八年开始，就坚持每周用两个半天学习毛主席著作和党的方针政策。以后，又发动全厂干部和职工参加这样经常性的学习活动。我们每走一步路，就对照一下毛主席是怎样说的，党的政策是怎样规定的，我们过去是怎样做的。这样，我们在困难的时候能见到光明，顺利的时候见到自己的不足。现在，全厂成立了二十多个学习小组，大家每天提前上班集体阅读半小时毛主席著作，使职工思想面貌发生了很大变化。许多工人学习了主席著作以后，不仅提高了思想认识，还积极帮助周围的伙伴进步，全厂初步形成了“思想工作人人做”的生动活泼的新局面。
