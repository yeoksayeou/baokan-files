    Japanese reactionary Sato, on January 28th, delivered a policy speech in the Diet. In the section on foreign policy, he went to great lengths to defend American aggression in Vietnam, actively peddled the Johnson administration’s “peace talks” swindle, praised the Soviet leadership, attacked China, promoted the “Japan-U.S. Security Treaty system,” and advocated for the overseas expansion of Japanese monopoly capital. This is a confession of the Sato government’s pro-American, United with the Soviet Union, anti-China diplomatic line, a self-incriminating statement of Japanese militarism following U.S. imperialism in aggression and expansion.
    Sato's whole scheme is presented under the guise of "peace." He said, "I have always taken upholding peace as the basic policy of diplomacy," with the aim of "realizing true peace." But how can Sato's methods deceive people? In the same speech, Sato blatantly clamored that he would never "unilaterally abolish the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" and never "declare neutrality"; that "maintaining the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty system" is the Japanese government's "most realistic policy." Foreign Minister Shiina more bluntly clamored in the Diet that Japan "must earnestly fulfill the obligations stipulated in the (Japan-U.S. Security) Treaty." This clearly shows that following the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism, tightly tying Japan to the American war chariot, is the core of the Sato government's foreign policy. The Sato government regards the "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty system" as its lifeblood. No matter how many times Sato and his ilk shout "peace," it can never conceal their reactionary nature of pursuing aggressive and war policies.
    In his policy speech, Sato particularly promoted "peaceful resolution of the Vietnam dispute." But let us peel back the skin and see what role the Sato government is playing in the issue of U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam.
    The Sato government has consistently supported the American war of aggression against Vietnam. It slandered the people of North Vietnam as "invading" the people of South Vietnam, falsely claimed that the American bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was a "legitimate retaliatory attack," and even shamelessly said that the poison gas used by U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam "does not violate international law." When Sato visited the United States in January last year, he openly clamored that "the South Vietnam war is a matter of life and death for Japan," and he assured Johnson that Japan would provide the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam with "any assistance it could provide." The Sato government also encouraged the American aggressors, urging them to "persist" in South Vietnam and "maintain South Vietnam's independence." From this vicious warmongering of the Sato government, where can one smell even a trace of "seeking peace"? It is the face of an out-and-out accomplice to aggression.
    In fact, Japan has long become a military and logistical base for the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam. This is no longer a secret.
    The more than two hundred U.S. military bases in Japan are directly serving the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. The U.S. invasion fleet sailed from Japanese ports such as Yokosuka and Sasebo to South Vietnam. American air pirates took off from bases in Japan to bomb and slaughter the Vietnamese people. American invading troops and munitions were continuously transported from Japan to the South Vietnamese battlefield. Even Tokyo's civilian airport serves American aggression against Vietnam. As for Okinawa, it goes without saying. Today, Okinawa is the most important and largest forward base and transshipment station for the U.S. aggression against Vietnam's sea, land, and air forces. Koizumi Junya, the former Director-General of the Japan "Defense Agency," openly admitted that Japanese bases are "very useful" for U.S. operations in Vietnam.
    Moreover, Japan also supplies a large amount of weapons and war materials to the American invading forces and the South Vietnamese puppet army, including rifles, hand grenades, military trucks, tanks, anti-tank rocket launchers, small ships, helicopters, and communication equipment, etc. The napalm and poison gas used by U.S. imperialism to slaughter the South Vietnamese people are also mostly provided by Japan. American warplanes and ships in Vietnam are overhauled in Japan. The Sato government also provides a large number of logistics personnel for American aggression against Vietnam. According to reports, there are now more than 1,200 Japanese people working on American landing craft alone.
    All this proves that Japan has actually been involved in this dirty war of aggression launched by U.S. imperialism in Asia. This is the most significant "achievement" since Sato came to power and a new symbol of the Japanese reactionaries' dependence on the United States and expansion into Southeast Asia. Now, no matter how Sato and his ilk pretend to "appeal" for a "peaceful resolution of the Vietnam dispute," they cannot conceal the fact that their hands are also stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people.
    It should be pointed out that the "peace negotiations" peddled by the Sato government are also acting in accordance with Washington's wishes. When Johnson's "unconditional discussions" conspiracy came out last year, the Sato government immediately responded and announced its readiness to "actively participate" in Johnson's "big stick and carrot" plan. In Johnson's recent activity of playing the "peace talks" trick again, the Sato government has become even more active, openly declaring that it "must seize every opportunity" to respond to the American "peace offensive." It has also decided to send people to engage in activities everywhere, serving as brokers for U.S. imperialism's "peace talks" swindle. Foreign Minister Shiina Etsusaburo went to Moscow to collude; this is one route. Vice President of the Liberal Democratic Party, Kawashima Shojiro, has gone to North Africa and the Middle East to engage in activities; this is another route. Special Envoy Yokoyama Masayuki will go to Indochina and European countries to canvass support; this is the third route. The Sato government is completely the pawn of Johnson's "peace talks" trick.
    Why is the Sato government so actively working for the Johnson administration's "peace talks" conspiracy? This is because the Japanese reactionaries are playing a shrewd game, hoping to profit from both sides. If the "peace talks" conspiracy really succeeds, U.S. imperialism can stabilize its colonial rule in South Vietnam, and Japanese monopoly capital can also join in and take the opportunity to infiltrate its influence into South Vietnam and Southeast Asia. If the "peace talks" swindle fails, the Sato government also hopes to use its so-called "peace" activities to disintegrate and weaken the support of Asian and African countries for the Vietnamese people, and to further promote the expansion of the war by U.S. imperialism. In the activity of peddling the "peace talks" trick, the Sato government also exposed that it is an accomplice to U.S. imperialism's aggression.
    Whether the Sato government directly supports the United States in expanding its war of aggression in Vietnam, or cheers for the American "peace talks" conspiracy, it is trying to profit from the chaos and gain an advantage from it. The Japanese reactionaries once regarded the American war of aggression against Korea as the first "kamikaze" to make a fortune from the war, and now they are excitedly calling the American war of aggression against Vietnam the "second kamikaze." In the past year or so, the amount of "special procurement orders" from the United States to Japan has risen sharply. Japanese monopoly capital is sacrificing the interests of the Japanese people and tying Japan's fate to the American war chariot, and this is the reason.
    The Sato government not only acts as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism on the Vietnam issue, but also signed the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" under the instructions of the United States, planned the "Northeast Asian Military Group," formulated secret military plans such as "Three Arrows" and "Flying Dragon" to attack Korea and China, and actively prepares to participate in the U.S. imperialist war of aggression. Today, U.S. imperialism regards Japan as an important tool for it to implement its counterrevolutionary global strategy in Asia. It not only requires Japan to become its logistics supply base for launching wars of aggression, but also wants Japan to contribute guns, money, and manpower to fully cooperate with U.S. imperialism's aggression and war plans in Asia. The Japanese ruling group, for the need of foreign expansion, has also strengthened its collusion with U.S. imperialism, stepped up arms expansion and war preparation, revived militarism, and further followed U.S. imperialism's aggression and war policies, attempting to rely on the strength of the United States to re-establish its colonial sphere of influence in Asia.
    It is clear that, with the support of U.S. imperialism, Japanese militarism is being revived and is gradually embarking on the old path of foreign aggression and expansion. Japanese militarist forces are increasingly becoming a threat to peace in Asia again.
    In order to conceal the reactionary policies of Japanese militarism, Sato, in his policy speech, praised the Khrushchev revisionists. He said that the "neighborly relations" between the Japanese government and the Soviet leadership are a concrete proof of his implementation of the "peaceful coexistence" policy. Shiina even complacently said that through his visit to the Soviet Union, "he strengthened his belief in contributing to the easing of tensions in Asia and maintaining world peace through Japan-Soviet friendship."
    Sato and his ilk are playing magic: it seems that with Japan-Soviet "friendship," the "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty system" is no longer a war system, but a "peace diplomacy." Just as the Indian reactionaries use the support of the Soviet leadership to patch up their tattered non-alignment policy, the Japanese reactionaries are also attempting to use the "friendship" of the Soviet leadership to decorate the facade of their "Japan-U.S. security system." But this is completely futile. Japan-Soviet collusion cannot cover up the ugliness of the Sato government; on the contrary, it can only prove the Japanese reactionaries' reliance on U.S. imperialism and betrayal of the Japanese people.
    Contrary to the estimates of Sato and his ilk, the Khrushchev revisionists have long lost the power to deceive the people. They have become as close as family with U.S. imperialism, the number one enemy of the people of the world, and have become partners. They love what U.S. imperialism loves and hate what U.S. imperialism hates. The people of the world increasingly understand that the primary meaning of Khrushchev revisionism is U.S.-Soviet cooperation, and collusion with Khrushchev revisionists is collusion with U.S. imperialism. The so-called "Japan-Soviet friendship" is just an extension of Japan-U.S. collusion.
    The Sato government fully understands that the main motive for the Soviet leadership's eagerness to collude with Japan is to oppose China. Shiina said without concealment when answering questions from Kyodo News reporters on January 21 this year that the Soviet leadership's "atmosphere of friendship with Japan is very strong. The Soviet Union has recently been actively launching a series of diplomatic activities to drive a wedge between China and the surrounding countries." This clearly shows that Japan-Soviet collusion is a product of the U.S. imperialist policy of "containing China."
    In his policy speech, Sato praised the Soviet leadership on the one hand and attacked China for "adopting a stubborn attitude" on the other. It is not surprising that Japanese reactionaries curse China. Since the Sato government wholeheartedly follows the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism and acts as a faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism, it must direct its spearhead at China. After Sato came to power, he has increasingly adopted a policy of hostility towards China. Sato and Shiina both clamored in their speeches to the Diet to "enhance" Japan's "friendly and amicable relations" with the Chiang Kai-shek gang. After the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" was signed, the Northeast Asian aggression group with Japan as the core, including the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek gang, has in fact been formed. Japanese militarists have also formulated blueprints for fighting against the Chinese people, attempting to attack China together with U.S. imperialism. However, the Chinese people cannot be insulted. Since the Chinese people do not put U.S. imperialism in their eyes, they dare and have the strength to beat the Japanese militarist forces that follow the American aggressors to a bloody pulp when they invade.
    Sato's policy speech reflects both the restlessness of the Japanese militarist forces and exposes its extreme weakness. The Japanese people firmly demand to take the road of independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and prosperity, and resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism. Therefore, Sato has to use some "peace" disguises to deceive the Japanese people. But this is of no use. The Japanese people's awareness is getting higher and higher, and they are fully capable of seeing that the Sato government is leading Japan on a dangerous path of participating in wars of aggression. The great Japanese people will never allow the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to push the Japanese nation into the abyss of disaster again, and will never allow the younger generation of Japan to be used as aggressive cannon fodder by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. The Japanese reactionaries rely on U.S. imperialism and take the old road of aggression in Asia, and they will not be able to escape the severe punishment of the Japanese people and all the Asian people. What awaits them can only be the fate of Tojo Hideki.

### 日本反动派亲美联苏反华的自白书——评佐藤的施政演说观察家

    日本反动派亲美联苏反华的自白书
    ——评佐藤的施政演说
    观察家
    日本首相佐藤一月二十八日在国会发表了施政演说。他在对外政策部分中，竭力为美国侵略越南进行辩护，积极推销约翰逊政府的“和谈”骗局，称赞苏联领导，攻击中国，宣扬“日美安全条约体制”，鼓吹日本垄断资本对外扩张。这是佐藤政府推行亲美联苏反华的外交路线的一篇自白书，是日本军国主义追随美帝国主义、对外进行侵略和扩张的一个自供状。
    佐藤的这一套，都是在“和平”的幌子下端出来的。他说，“我一直把坚持和平作为外交的基本方针”，目的是要“实现真正和平”。但是，佐藤的这种手法，怎么能迷惑得了人呢？佐藤在同一个演说中就露骨地叫嚷，他绝不“单方面废除日美安全条约”，绝不“宣布中立”；“保持日美安全条约体制”是日本政府“最现实的政策”。日本外务大臣椎名在国会里更加露骨地叫嚷，日本“必须切实地履行（日美安全）条约规定的义务”。这就清楚地表明，追随美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，把日本紧紧地拴在美国的战车上，乃是佐藤政府对外政策的核心。佐藤政府把“日美安全条约体制”当作它的命根子。不管佐藤之流在嘴巴上喊一千个“和平”，一万个“和平”，都绝不能掩盖他们奉行侵略政策和战争政策的反动面目。
    佐藤在施政演说中，特别鼓吹“和平解决越南争端”。但是，让我们剥开皮来看一看，佐藤政府在美帝国主义侵略越南的问题上，究竟扮演一个什么角色。
    佐藤政府一贯支持美国侵略越南的战争。它诬蔑越南北方人民“侵略”了南方人民，胡说美国轰炸越南民主共和国是什么“正当的报复攻击”，甚至无耻地说，美帝国主义在越南南方使用的毒气，“不违犯国际法”。佐藤在去年一月访美的时候，公开叫嚷“南越战争与日本生死攸关”，他向约翰逊保证，日本要对美国侵越战争给予它“所能给予的任何援助”。佐藤政府还为美国侵略者打气，要它在南越“坚持下去”，“维护南越的独立”。人们从佐藤政府的这一片穷凶极恶的战争叫嚷声中，哪里能嗅得到一丝一毫“寻求和平”的气味呢？这是一副不折不扣的侵略帮凶的嘴脸。
    事实上，日本早就变成了美帝国主义侵越战争的军事基地和后勤基地。这已经不是什么秘密了。
    美国在日本的二百多个军事基地，都在直接为美国侵越战争服务。美国的侵略舰队从横须贺、佐世保等日本的港口开往南越。美国的空中强盗从日本的基地上起飞，去轰炸和屠杀越南人民。美国的侵略军和军火源源不断地从日本运往南越战场。甚至东京的民用机场也为美国侵略越南服务。至于冲绳岛就更不用说了。今天的冲绳，是美国侵略越南的海、陆、空三军最主要、最庞大的前哨基地和转运站。日本前“防卫厅”长官小泉纯也公开承认，日本的基地对美国在越南作战是“非常有用的”。
    不仅如此，日本还把大量武器和作战物资，源源供应美国侵略军和南越傀儡军，其中包括步枪、手榴弹、军用卡车、坦克、反坦克火箭炮、小型舰艇、直升飞机和通讯器材，等等。美帝国主义屠杀南越人民的凝固汽油弹和毒气，大部分也是由日本提供的。美国在越南的作战飞机和舰艇在日本进行检修。佐藤政府还为美国侵略越南提供了大批后勤人员。据报道，现在仅仅在美国登陆艇上工作的，就有一千二百多名日本人。
    所有这一切证明，日本实际上已经卷入了美帝国主义在亚洲发动的这场肮脏的侵略战争。这是佐藤上台以后最显著的一项“政绩”，也是日本反动派依附美国、向东南亚扩张的一个新的标志。现在，佐藤之流不管怎样装模作样地出来“呼吁”什么“和平解决越南争端”，都无法掩饰他们双手也沾满了越南人民的鲜血。
    应当指出，佐藤政府所贩卖的“和平谈判”，也是仰着华盛顿的鼻息行事的。当去年约翰逊“无条件讨论”的阴谋出笼以后，佐藤政府就立即响应，并且宣布准备“积极参加”约翰逊的“大棒和胡萝卜”计划。在最近约翰逊又一次玩弄“和谈”骗局的活动中，佐藤政府更加活跃起来，公开宣称它“要抓住一切机会”响应美国的“和平攻势”。它还决定派人四出活动，为美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局充当掮客。外务大臣椎名悦三郎去莫斯科进行勾搭，这是一路。自由民主党副总裁川岛正次郎已去北非和中近东进行活动，这又是一路。特使横山正幸将去印度支那和欧洲各国进行拉拢，这是第三路。佐藤政府完全是约翰逊“和谈”骗局的马前卒。
    为什么佐藤政府这么起劲地为约翰逊政府的“和谈”阴谋效劳呢？这是因为日本反动派打着一个左右逢源的如意算盘。假若“和谈”阴谋真能得逞的话，美帝国主义就可以稳定它在南越的殖民统治，日本垄断资本也可以加入一股，趁机把自己的势力渗入南越和东南亚。如果“和谈”骗局不能得售，佐藤政府也指望通过自己的所谓“和平”活动，来瓦解和削弱亚非国家对越南人民的支持，并为美帝国主义进一步扩大战争张目。佐藤政府在兜售“和谈”骗局的活动中，也暴露了它是美帝国主义的侵略帮凶。
    不管佐藤政府直接支持美国扩大侵略越南的战争冒险，还是替美国的“和谈”阴谋摇旗呐喊，它都是想趁火打劫，混水摸鱼，从中大捞一把。日本反动派曾经把美国侵略朝鲜的战争当作是发战争横财的第一次“神风”，现在又兴高采烈地把美国侵略越南的战争称为“第二次神风”。这一年多来，美国向日本的“特需订货”额急剧上升。日本垄断资本不惜牺牲日本人民的利益，把日本的命运拴在美国的战车上，原因就在这里。
    佐藤政府不仅在越南问题上充当美帝国主义的帮凶，而且在美国的指使下签订了“日韩条约”，策划“东北亚军事集团”，拟订了进攻朝鲜和中国的“三矢”、“飞龙”等秘密军事计划，积极准备参加美帝国主义的侵略战争。今天，美帝国主义已经把日本看作是它在亚洲推行反革命全球战略的一个重要工具。它不仅要求日本成为它发动侵略战争的后勤供应基地，而且要日本出枪，出钱，出人，在亚洲全面配合美帝国主义的侵略和战争计划。而日本统治集团则为了对外扩张的需要，也加强了同美帝国主义的勾结，加紧扩军备战，复活军国主义，进一步追随美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，企图凭借美国的力量，在亚洲重新建立起它的殖民势力范围。
    事情很清楚，在美帝国主义的扶植下，日本军国主义正在死灰复燃，一步一步地走上向外侵略和扩张的老路。日本军国主义势力正在日益再度成为对亚洲和平的威胁。
    为了掩饰日本军国主义的反动政策，佐藤在施政演说中，把赫鲁晓夫修正主义者抬了出来。他说，日本政府同苏联领导之间的“睦邻关系”，是他推行“和平共处”政策的具体证明。椎名甚至自鸣得意地说，通过他的对苏联访问，“增强了通过日苏友好来为缓和亚洲紧张局势、维护世界和平做出贡献的信念”。
    佐藤之流在玩弄魔术：似乎有了日苏“亲善”，“日美安全条约体制”就不再是战争体制了，而是什么“和平外交”了。正如印度反动派借助于苏联领导的支持，来补缀它那件破烂不堪的不结盟政策的外衣一样，日本反动派也企图利用苏联领导的“亲善”，来装饰它的“日美安全体制”的门面。但是，这完全是徒劳的。日苏勾结绝不能为佐藤政府遮丑，相反地只能证明日本反动派对美帝国主义的投靠和对日本人民的背叛。
    同佐藤之流的估计相反，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者早已失去迷惑人民的力量了。他们已经同全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义亲如一家，结为伙伴。他们亲美帝国主义之所亲，仇美帝国主义之所仇。全世界人民越来越懂得，赫鲁晓夫修正主义的首要含义就是美苏合作，同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者勾结就是同美帝国主义勾结。所谓“日苏亲善”，不过是日美勾结的延长罢了。
    佐藤政府十分了解，苏联领导急于同日本勾结，其主要动机在于反华。椎名在今年一月二十一日答共同社记者问的时候毫不隐讳地说，苏联领导“对日亲善的气氛是浓得很的。苏联最近正在积极展开一系列的外交活动，要在中国的周围各国中间打入楔子。”这就清楚地表明，日苏勾结正是美帝国主义“遏制中国”政策的一个产物。
    佐藤在施政演说中，一方面夸奖苏联领导，另一方面大肆攻击中国“采取顽固的态度”。日本反动派诅咒中国，这是一点也不奇怪的。佐藤政府既然死心塌地地追随美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，充当美帝国主义的忠实走卒，它就一定要把矛头指向中国。佐藤上台以后，越来越露骨地采取敌视中国的政策。佐藤和椎名在国会演说中都叫嚣“增强”日本同蒋介石匪帮的“友好亲善关系”。“日韩条约”签订以后，以日本为核心、包括台湾蒋介石匪帮的东北亚侵略集团，事实上已经形成。日本军国主义者并且已经制订了同中国人民作战的蓝图，企图同美帝国主义一起进攻中国。但是，中国人民是不可侮的。中国人民既然不把美帝国主义放在眼里，也敢于而且有力量把追随美国侵略者之后的日本军国主义势力，在它来犯的时候，打个头破血流。
    佐藤的施政演说，既反映了日本军国主义势力的蠢蠢欲动，也暴露了它的极端虚弱。日本人民坚决要求走独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣的道路，坚决反对美帝国主义和日本军国主义。因此，佐藤不得不用一些“和平”伪装，来欺骗日本人民。但是，这是没有任何用处的。日本人民的觉悟越来越高，他们完全能够看清，佐藤政府正在把日本引向参加侵略战争的危险道路。伟大的日本人民，决不允许美日反动派把日本民族再次推进灾难的深渊，决不允许日本的青年一代再去充当美日反动派的侵略炮灰。日本反动派依靠美帝国主义，走侵略亚洲的老路，一定逃不脱日本人民和全体亚洲人民的严厉惩罚。等待着他们的只能是东条英机的下场。
