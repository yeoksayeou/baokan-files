    Santo Domingo dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: The people of the Dominican Republic's capital are persisting in their struggle, heroically fighting back against the bloody suppression by American aggressor troops and Dominican reactionary police and military. Patriotic residents continue to incessantly attack American aggressors and the "Pan-American Forces" under their control.
    On the morning of the 14th, before dawn, Dominican snipers used machine guns to fire on a US military jeep patrol and threw grenades in the downtown area, wounding six (Pan-American Forces) soldiers who were helping the American aggressors. On the same day, Dominican patriotic masses also wounded an American soldier and three Dominican reactionary policemen.
    The nationwide general strike of more than 80,000 workers from all walks of life in the Dominican Republic continues, bringing government agencies and other industrial sectors to a standstill. Shops in the capital, Santo Domingo, are tightly shuttered.
    Alarmed by the active armed actions of patriotic residents in Santo Domingo and the continued development of the strike struggle, the American aggressors are increasing their forces and preparing to intensify their bloody suppression. The US 82nd Airborne Division has dispatched a company of paratroopers into the center of Santo Domingo. According to the Associated Press, the American soldiers entering the city center are also equipped with so-called "infrared" equipment to prevent night attacks by Dominican patriotic snipers.
    American paratroopers and fully armed Dominican police continue to search patriotic residents for weapons. However, in this city with a glorious history of struggle, the sound of patriotic sniper fire can still be heard constantly.
    It is reported that patriotic residents also possess a large number of weapons, and snipers are equipped with grenades.
    At the same time, US official spokespersons have once again openly stated that the American aggressors insist on their policy of intervention in the Dominican Republic and suppression of the Dominican people's patriotic struggle.
    US State Department spokesman McCloskey issued a statement on the 14th saying that the United States "expressed concern" about the situation in the Dominican Republic and that it would further interfere in Dominican affairs through the Organization of American States.

    多米尼加爱国者猛烈袭击美国侵略军
    圣多明各枪战激烈　美国增调伞兵加紧镇压
    新华社十五日讯　圣多明各消息：多米尼加首都人民坚持斗争，英勇反击美国侵略军和多米尼加反动军警的血腥镇压。爱国居民继续不断袭击美国侵略者和它控制的“泛美部队”。
    十四日凌晨，多米尼加狙击手在黎明前的黑暗中用机关枪向一支美军吉普车巡逻队射击，同时还在闹市区投扔手榴弹，炸伤了为美国侵略者帮凶的六名（泛美部队）士兵。这一天，多米尼加爱国群众还打伤了一名美国兵和三名多米尼加反动警察。
    多米尼加各行各业八万多名工人的全国性总罢工仍在继续进行，罢工使政府机关和其他工业部门的活动陷于停顿，首都圣多明各的商店都紧闭着大门。
    由于圣多明各爱国居民武装行动十分活跃和罢工斗争的继续发展，十分惊慌的美国侵略者又在增加兵力，准备加强血腥镇压。美国第八十二空降师已经增派一连伞兵开入圣多明各市中心。据美联社透露，进入市中心的美国兵还配备了什么“红外线”装备来防止多米尼加爱国狙击手的夜间袭击。
    美国伞兵和全副武装的多米尼加警察继续搜查爱国居民的武器。但是，在这个有着光荣斗争历史的城市里，仍然能够不断听到爱国狙击手的枪声。
    据报道，爱国居民还掌握有大量武器，狙击手都装备有手榴弹。
    与此同时，美国官方发言人又一次公开表示美国侵略者坚持对多米尼加的干涉政策，镇压多米尼加人民的爱国斗争。
    美国国务院新闻发布官麦克洛斯基十四日发表声明说，美国对多米尼加的局势“表示关切”，并且表示要通过美洲国家组织进一步干涉多米尼加的事务。
