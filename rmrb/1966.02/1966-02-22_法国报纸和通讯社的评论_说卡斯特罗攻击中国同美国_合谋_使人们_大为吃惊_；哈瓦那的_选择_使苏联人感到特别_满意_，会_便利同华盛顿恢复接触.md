    Saying Castro's Attack on China, Said to be in "Collusion" with the United States, "Greatly Surprised" People; Havana's "Choice" Makes the Soviets Particularly "Satisfied" and Will "Facilitate the Restoration of Contact with Washington"
    Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported from Washington on February 6:
    Some communist affairs experts here said tonight that they were not surprised by Cuban Prime Minister Castro's fierce attack on People's China, but they were completely surprised by his accusation that China was colluding with the United States to undermine the Cuban economy.
    These experts pointed out that at the end of last year, People's China notified Cuba that it would no longer supply rice to Cuba in exchange for sugar. Here, this action is regarded as a sign of increasingly tense relations between the two countries. Therefore, Prime Minister Castro's fierce speech tonight was not entirely unexpected.
    But the accusation of Sino-U.S. collusion greatly surprised them, because Chinese propaganda always says that Washington and Moscow have secret agreements against Chinese interests. Previously, no one had ever accused the Americans of working with People's China against Cuba.
      "Le Monde" published an editorial on February 8 entitled "Fidel's Logic," excerpts of which are as follows:
    The intense tone with which Castro accused the Beijing government in Havana may be surprising. It is true that the "Supreme Leader" has always been known for his outspokenness, but before this, he had always avoided openly taking sides in the divisions that split the socialist world.
    Therefore, it should be considered that Castro made this amazing move, which may foreshadow a complete rupture between his government and the Beijing leaders, for very important economic and political reasons. One might even think that Havana's "choice" (a choice that the Soviets have reason to be particularly satisfied with) is only the first stage in the process of a complete break between Moscow and Beijing.
    In short, foreign observers cannot help but notice that the Cuban Prime Minister's vicious attack coincided with the visit of Soviet Foreign Trade Minister Patolichev to Havana to negotiate a new trade agreement between Cuba and the Soviet Union.
    In any case, it is certain that the Cuban economy will depend on massive Soviet aid for at least the next few years, and the Chinese objections in September last year to the trade agreement concluded with Cuba particularly angered Castro.
    However, it is not understanding the reality of Cuba to reduce this dispute to a "fight over a few pounds of rice."
    The real reason for this small country's accusations against China is political. The particularly obvious stubbornness of the Chinese during the debates within and outside the committees during the Tricontinental Conference, as well as Beijing's continued propaganda campaign against "revisionist traitors," undoubtedly prompted the Cuban Prime Minister to no longer tolerate such interference in his home.
    "L'Aurore" published an article on February 7 entitled "Extortion, Coercion, Betrayal, These are Castro's New Words for Attacking Beijing," excerpts of which are as follows:
    There is nothing left to deal with between Havana and Beijing. The cause of the dispute is a material concept of trade between the two countries: rice.
    In fact, Castro, who had long wavered between the two communisms, and even tried to make them compete with each other for a time due to food supplies, finally chose Moscow, which is also a Cuban-style choice.
    This choice is so fervent and strong that observers speculate whether things will end here diplomatically.
    Castro spoke frankly: He condemned the Beijing leaders for showing "contempt," "hypocrisy," and "rudeness" to the Republic of Cuba.
    In a long list of accusations published in a Havana newspaper, the words "extortion," "coercion," and "betrayal" appeared more than fifty times.
    What does Cuba want?
    First, apart from the vanished revolutionary fantasy, it is trying to regenerate. Wouldn't breaking off relations with the "yellow big brother" facilitate the restoration of contact with Washington at some point?
    Moscow is satisfied with all this.
    AFP reporter Dodds reported from Havana on February 7:
    The rice issue is just an excuse, because what caused the explosion, angered the Cuban government, and prompted it to openly explode in anger was Beijing's continued unwavering political propaganda. Castro seized the opportunity. According to Castro's statement, on September 14 last year, President Dorticos and he himself asked the Beijing Chargé d'Affaires to stop distributing Chinese political news briefings and conducting propaganda among Cuban officers and senior officials.
    Observers are almost certain that the Cuban leader's attitude in the face of "Beijing's imperialist offensive" may further weaken the pro-China group of Latin American revolutionaries. Since Castro's speech on January 15, these revolutionaries have become a minority and are on the defensive. At that time, he condemned "those Trotskyist divisive agents who serve imperialism." This can be regarded as a veiled attack on Beijing. Today's attack is head-on.
    "Le Figaro" published an article on February 8 by its special correspondent in New York, excerpts of which are as follows:
    Fidel Castro's public condemnation of the "betrayal" by the Chinese Communist government, and the de facto rupture that has occurred between Havana and Beijing, have caused a great sensation among international diplomats.
    However, whatever the reasons for Fidel Castro's personal anger, it should generally be admitted that the economic survival of his regime is too completely dependent on Moscow to allow him to condemn Communist China in his speech as he has done without the consent of the Kremlin.
    Thus, one can draw the conclusion that what Castro has done is in fact what Moscow intended, and many people have already crossed the line between them. In any case, Washington is pleased to see Havana condemn Beijing for "practicing extortion, coercion, oppression, aggression, and strangulation against small countries," although Castro also said that Communist China is imitating "U.S. imperialism" in doing so.
    But if the rupture between Havana and Beijing is a harbinger and a signal, that is to say, if this rupture marks the decision of the Soviet Union and the world communist movement it leads to finally and formally expel Mao Zedong's China from the communist family, then yesterday's condemnation by Cuba will truly form a historic turning point, not for Cuba, but for the world.

### 法国报纸和通讯社的评论  说卡斯特罗攻击中国同美国“合谋”使人们“大为吃惊”；哈瓦那的“选择”使苏联人感到特别“满意”，会“便利同华盛顿恢复接触”

　　法国报纸和通讯社的评论
    说卡斯特罗攻击中国同美国“合谋”使人们“大为吃惊”；哈瓦那的“选择”使苏联人感到特别“满意”，会“便利同华盛顿恢复接触”
    法新社二月六日从华盛顿发出的报道说：
    这里的一些共产党问题专家今天晚上对古巴总理卡斯特罗猛烈攻击人民中国并不感到意外，但是他们对他指责中国同美国合谋破坏古巴经济这一点完全感到吃惊。
    这些专家指出，去年年底，人民中国曾通知古巴说，它不再向古巴供应大米来换取食糖。这里认为这一行动是表明两国关系越来越紧张的一种迹象，因此，卡斯特罗总理今晚激烈的演说并不完全出人意外。
    但是说中美合谋的这种指责却使他们大为吃惊，因为中国的宣传总是说华盛顿和莫斯科在反对中国利益方面有暗中的协议。以前，谁也没有指责过美国人同人民中国一起来反对古巴。
      《世界报》二月八日发表了题为《菲德尔的逻辑》的社论，摘要如下：
    卡斯特罗在哈瓦那对北京政府进行指责的激烈的语调可能使人感到惊异。诚然，这位“最高领导人”一直是以直言不讳而称著，但是，他在此之前始终避免在使社会主义世界分裂的分歧中公开采取偏袒态度。
    因此，应当认为，卡斯特罗出于非常重大的经济和政治原因才作出这种可能预示着他的政府同北京领导人之间完全破裂的惊人的举动。人们甚至可以认为，哈瓦那的“选择”（这种选择使苏联人有理由感到特别满意）仅仅是莫斯科和北京彻底决裂的过程的第一个阶段。
    总之，外国人士势必注意到，古巴总理的这次穷凶极恶的抨击，是在苏联外贸部长帕托利切夫去哈瓦那谈判一项古巴和苏联之间新的贸易协定这件事同时发生的。
    不管怎样，可以肯定，古巴的经济至少在今后若干年内要依赖苏联的巨大援助，而中国人去年九月对同古巴缔结的贸易协定提出异议特别厉害地激怒了卡斯特罗。
    但是，如果把这场争吵缩小为“几斤大米之争”，那是不了解古巴的现实情况。
    这个小国对中国进行指责的真正原因是政治性的。中国人在三大洲会议期间在委员会内和会外进行辩论时所持的格外明显的固执态度以及北京继续进行反对“修正主义叛徒”的宣传运动，都无疑促使了这位古巴总理决不能再容忍这种对他家里的干涉。
    《震旦报》二月七日以《讹诈、威逼、出卖，这是卡斯特罗攻击北京的新词汇》为题发表文章，摘要如下：
    哈瓦那和北京之间再也没有什么可来往了。争吵的起因是这两国间贸易的一种物质概念：大米。
    事实上，卡斯特罗在两个共产主义之间长期动摇不定、甚至在某个时期由于粮食供应的原因而企图使它们互相竞争，最后，他终于选择了莫斯科，这也是古巴式的选择。
    这种选择是如此的热烈和强烈，以致观察家们猜测，在外交上事情是否将到此为止。
    卡斯特罗直言不讳：他谴责北京领导人对古巴共和国表现出“轻蔑”、“伪善”和“无礼”。
    在哈瓦那的一份报纸上发表的一大篇罪状中，“讹诈”、“威逼”、“出卖”的字眼出现了五十多次。
    古巴希望什么呢？
    首先，除了化为乌有的革命空想外，它试图再生。同“黄种老大哥”的断绝关系到一定时候难道不会便利同华盛顿恢复接触吗？
    莫斯科对于所有这一切表示满意。
    法新社记者多德二月七日从哈瓦那发出的报道说：
    大米问题只不过是一个借口，因为引起爆炸、使古巴政府恼火并促使它公开大发脾气的，是北京继续进行的毫不示弱的政治宣传。卡斯特罗抓住了这个时机。据卡斯特罗的声明说，去年九月十四日，多尔蒂科斯总统和他本人曾要求北京代办停止在古巴军官和高级官员中散发中国的政治新闻简报和进行宣传。
    观察家们几乎可以肯定，这位古巴领导人在“北京的帝国主义进攻”的情况下采取的态度可能进一步削弱拉丁美洲革命者的亲中国的集团。自从卡斯特罗一月十五日的讲话以来，这些革命者已成为少数派并处于守势了。那时他谴责“那些为帝国主义效劳的托洛茨基派的分裂活动代理人”。可以认为这是对北京的影射攻击。今天的攻击是正面的。
    《费加罗报》二月八日发表了该报驻纽约特派记者发出的一篇文章，摘要如下：
    菲德尔·卡斯特罗对中国共产党政府“出卖”的公开谴责以及哈瓦那和北京之间出现的事实上的决裂已在国际外交人士中引起巨大轰动。
    但是，不管菲德尔·卡斯特罗个人愤怒的原因是什么，一般而言，应该承认，他的政权的经济生存过于完全依赖莫斯科，以致他不可能在没有克里姆林宫的同意下就象他已做的那样在讲话中对共产党中国进行谴责。
    从而得出结论，即事实上卡斯特罗的所作所为是为莫斯科打算的，在这之间，仅有一步之差，许多人已经跨过了这一步。无论如何，华盛顿是高兴地看到哈瓦那谴责北京“对小国实行讹诈、威逼、压迫、侵略和扼杀”，尽管卡斯特罗还说，共产党中国这种做法是仿效“美帝国主义”。
    但是，如果哈瓦那和北京之间的决裂是一种预兆和信号，即是说如果这种决裂标志着苏联和它所领导的世界共产主义运动决定最终和正式地把毛泽东中国开除出共产主义大家庭，那么，古巴昨天的谴责将真正形成不是对古巴来说，而是对世界来说是一个历史转折点。
