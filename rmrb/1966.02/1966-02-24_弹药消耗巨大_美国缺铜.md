　　Ammunition Consumption Huge
　　United States Lacks Copper
    (Our Paper's Dispatch) The war of aggression against Vietnam has caused a strain on the copper supply in the United States. According to the American "Newsweek" in its issue of February 21st, an official from the US Department of Commerce said that when there is a rustle in the jungles of South Vietnam, "one of our guys fires a hundred bullets." "Newsweek" claimed that regardless of the military effect of this "practice," it brought "considerable economic consequences," each burst of fire consuming one dollar's worth of copper. "Newsweek" said that the war of aggression against Vietnam currently consumes six percent of US copper production, and it is estimated that this consumption will double this year.
    "Newsweek" stated that the urgent need for military copper has affected the supply of civilian copper. Large enterprises such as Ford Motor Company have already felt the "serious problem" of copper shortage. Many companies have been forced to postpone delivery dates. The National Association of Purchasing Management declared that, compared with other commodities, copper is the most lacking, and the delivery dates are also longer.
    The tension in the copper supply has led to an increase in copper prices. Last year, the price of copper rose from 34 cents per pound to 36 cents. When the price of copper was about to rise again to 38 cents per pound, Johnson approved the use of 200,000 tons of strategic reserves of copper to meet military needs. At that time, US Secretary of Defense McNamara said, "Despite the copper industry's best efforts to supply the market, our greatly increased defensive efforts in Vietnam and the recent turmoil in international politics have created a risk of confusion and change in the copper market."
    According to "Newsweek", the annual US copper production is approximately 1.4 million tons. According to McNamara, the US government consumes about 250,000 tons of copper annually, including military needs. The need for copper is greatest in the manufacture of aircraft electronic systems, ammunition, and shell casings.

### 弹药消耗巨大  美国缺铜

　　弹药消耗巨大
　　美国缺铜
    本报讯　侵越战争造成了美国的铜的供应紧张。据二月二十一日一期的美国《新闻周刊》报道，美国商务部一个官员说，在南越丛林里一有响动“我们的一个小伙子就发射一百粒子弹”。《新闻周刊》称，不管这种“练习”的军事效果如何，它却带来了“可观的经济后果”，每发射一阵消耗价值一美元的铜。《新闻周刊》说，侵越战争目前消耗美国铜产量的百分之六，估计这个消耗量今年将增加一倍。
    《新闻周刊》称，军用铜的迫切需要，已经影响民用铜的供应。福特汽车公司等大企业已经感到缺铜的“严重问题”。许多公司被迫推迟了交货日期。全国采购商协会宣称，与其他商品比较起来，铜的缺乏最甚，交货的日期也更长一些。
    铜的供应紧张导致铜价的上涨。去年，铜的价格由每磅三角四分美元上涨到三角六分。当铜的每磅价格再要上涨为三角八分的时候，约翰逊批准动用战略储备的二十万吨铜以应付军事需要。当时美国国防部长麦克纳马拉说，“尽管铜业作了最大的努力来供应市场，我们在越南的大为增加的防御努力和最近的国际政局的动乱有使铜市场混乱和变样的危险。”
    据《新闻周刊》报道，美国铜的年产量约为一百四十万吨。据麦克纳马拉宣称，美国政府消耗的铜、包括军事需要在内，每年约二十五万吨。在制造飞机的电子系统、弹药和弹壳方面，铜的需要量最大。
