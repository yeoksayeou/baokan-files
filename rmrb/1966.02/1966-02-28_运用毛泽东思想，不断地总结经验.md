　　The successful creation of the double water-cooled internal combustion turbine generator once again proves that Mao Zedong Thought commands everything. The creators of this generator, following the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, used dialectical materialism to analyze and resolve the various contradictions encountered in the process of practice, summarized experience in a timely manner, and advanced step by step until the successful creation. The article "Dialectics Teaches Intelligence" summarizes their experience and is a good article.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said that we need to constantly summarize and accumulate experience in economic construction. He pointed out, "It must be understood that there is a contradiction in this matter, that is, the contradiction between the objective laws of economic development in socialist society and our subjective understanding, which needs to be resolved in practice." How can we understand objective laws? The practice of manufacturing double water-cooled internal combustion turbine generators proves that as long as we use Mao Zedong Thought to continuously summarize practical experience, we can gradually understand and apply objective laws.
    Revolutionary dialectics develops in the struggle against metaphysics. In the process of creating double water-cooled internal combustion turbine generators, almost every step forward encountered obstacles from absolute, static, isolated, and unchanging metaphysical viewpoints. The struggle between dialectics and metaphysics runs through the entire process of generator creation.
    People with metaphysical viewpoints believe that to manufacture generators and solve the contradiction between power generation capacity and motor heating, one can only follow behind others, not run ahead of others. On the basis of air-cooled technology, one can only first use hydrogen cooling, and only after others have researched rotor water-cooled methods can "double water-cooled" technology be adopted. They believe that this is the inevitable path for motor manufacturing and an insurmountable "convention." Is this really the case? The creators of the double water-cooled generator constantly summarized experience through practice and finally realized that catching up from behind is a universal law of the development of things, and the old ways of predecessors can be jumped out of. Of course, learning from others is necessary for a certain period. However, once you learn to walk, you should think about jumping, jumping over your predecessors, innovating, taking your own path, and catching up with and surpassing advanced levels. This is not "abnormal" but normal. In this way, they skipped the hydrogen cooling stage and directly conquered the cutting-edge technology of double water-cooled.
    People with metaphysical viewpoints believe that to create, the original structure of the air-cooled generator must be completely discarded, and everything must be started from scratch, otherwise it is not enough to talk about innovation. This is to absolutize the relationship between inheritance and innovation, learning and creation. The creators of the double water-cooled generator thoroughly broke this view in practice. Innovation is negation, but it is negation on the basis of affirming the rational parts; innovation cannot sever the history of scientific and technological development, but should innovate in inheritance and create in learning. This is an important experience they have gained in practice.
    People with metaphysical viewpoints believe that to create a double water-cooled internal combustion turbine generator, one must first conduct experimental research, then design, and finally trial-produce. They believe that these three stages do not allow any overlap and can only be carried out step by step. This view was also shattered. Practice has proved that the three, experimental research, design, and trial production can and should be carried out in an overlapping manner. This can closely integrate the creation of motors with production practice, closely integrate workers, technicians, and leading cadres, and is a major guarantee for developing new technologies in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    The creation process of the double water-cooled internal combustion turbine generator is the process by which people constantly explore the objective laws of this generator in accordance with the teachings of "On Practice." Their design schemes have failed many times and been revised many times, advancing forward again and again. Their understanding of the principle of this generator has also deepened again and again, finally transforming the subjective into the objective. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The changing movement of the objective real world is never-ending, and people's understanding of truth in practice is also never-ending. Marxism-Leninism has not ended truth, but is constantly opening up the path to understanding truth in practice." Using Mao Zedong Thought to continuously summarize experience and "constantly open up the path to understanding truth" has made the creators of double water-cooled generators become intelligent and climb to the peak of this science and technology.

### 运用毛泽东思想，不断地总结经验

　　运用毛泽东思想，不断地总结经验
    双水内冷汽轮发电机创制成功，再一次证明毛泽东思想统帅一切。这种发电机的创制者们，按照毛泽东同志的教导，运用唯物辩证法分析和解决实践过程中遇到的诸种矛盾，及时总结经验，一步一个脚印地不断前进，直到创制成功。《辩证法教人聪明》一文，总结了他们的经验，是一篇好文章。
    毛泽东同志说过，我们需要在经济建设中不断地总结和积累经验。他指出，“必须懂得，在这个问题上是存在着矛盾的，即社会主义社会经济发展的客观规律和我们主观认识之间的矛盾，这需要在实践中去解决。”怎样才能够认识客观规律呢？制造双水内冷汽轮发电机的实践证明，只要运用毛泽东思想，不断地总结实践经验，就能够逐步认识和运用客观规律。
    革命的辩证法是在同形而上学作斗争中发展起来的。在双水内冷汽轮发电机的创制过程中，几乎每前进一步，都遇到绝对的、静止的、孤立的、不变的形而上学观点的阻碍。辩证法同形而上学的斗争，贯穿于发电机创制过程的始终。
    有形而上学观点的人们认为，制造发电机，解决发电能力和电机发热之间的矛盾，只能跟在别人后面，不能跑在别人前面，在空冷技术基础上，只能先用氢冷的办法，等别人研究出转子水内冷的办法，才能采用“双水内冷”技术。他们认为这是电机制造的必由之路，是不可逾越的“常规”。事情果真是这样的吗？双水内冷发电机创制者，不断通过实践总结经验，终于认识到：后来居上是事物发展的普遍规律，前人的窠臼是可以跳出来的。当然，在一定时期内，向别人学步是必要的。但是，一旦学会了走，就应当想到跳，跳过前人，实行创新，走自己的路，赶上和超过先进水平。这不是“反常”，而是正常。就这样，他们跳过了实行氢冷的阶段，直接攻取了双水内冷这个尖端。
    有形而上学观点的人们认为，要创造，就得把原来的空冷发电机的结构完全丢开，一切从头做起，否则就不足以言创新。这是把继承和革新、学习和创造的关系绝对化了。双水内冷发电机创制者，在实践中彻底破除了这个观点。创新，是否定，但是在肯定合理部分的基础上的否定；创新，不能割断科学技术发展的历史，而应当在继承中革新，在学习中创造。这是他们在实践中取得的一条重要经验。
    有形而上学观点的人们认为，创制双水内冷汽轮发电机，只能先试验研究，再设计，最后试制。他们认为这三个阶段不容许有任何交叉，只能按部就班地进行。这种观点同样被打破了。实践证明，试验研究、设计、试制三者可以而且应当交叉进行，这样可以使电机的创制工作和生产实践密切结合，使工人、技术人员和领导干部密切结合，是多快好省地发展新技术的一大保证。
    双水内冷汽轮发电机的创制过程，就是人们按照《实践论》的教导，不断探索这种发电机的客观规律的过程。他们的设计方案，失败过许多次，修改过许多次，一次又一次地向前，他们对于这种发电机原理的认识，也就一次又一次地深化，终于使主观的东西变成了客观的东西。毛泽东同志说过，“客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结。马克思列宁主义并没有结束真理，而是在实践中不断地开辟认识真理的道路。”运用毛泽东思想，不断地总结经验，“不断地开辟认识真理的道路”，这就使得双水内冷发电机的创制者们变得聪明起来，登上这个科学技术的高峰。
