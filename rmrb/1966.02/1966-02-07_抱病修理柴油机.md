    Repairing a Diesel Engine While Ill
    Deputy Driller Chen Delin
    One day, mechanical technician Li Zixin's toe was injured by a machine, and the area below his knee was swollen very thick. He returned to the dormitory to rest. Suddenly, he saw a worker, panting, rushing through the heavy rain to find him. As soon as he heard that the machine had malfunctioned, he didn't say a word, put down his crutches, and stuffed his swollen foot into a pair of big rain boots. That person quickly dissuaded him: "Just give me some advice, and we can fix it. It's raining hard, so don't go!" "Comrade, a machine is like a person's stomach. If it has appendicitis, asking someone who doesn't understand medicine to operate will only worsen the condition and lead to death!" Saying that, he hobbled straight to the well site. The worker, seeing that he couldn't be dissuaded, had no choice but to go to the dormitory to get him a raincoat and support him to the well site. That night, Li Zixin and his comrades worked until dawn, repairing the machine. By this time, his legs had been soaked even thicker by the water. After the rain stopped and the sky cleared, the sun rose slowly from the east. Infinite joy appeared on Li Zixin's face as he slowly hobbled back to the dormitory.

    抱病修理柴油机
    副司钻　陈德林
    一天，机械技术员李自新的脚趾被机器碰伤，膝盖以下肿得很粗，他回到宿舍休息，突然见到一位工人气喘喘地冒着大雨来找自己。他一听是机器出了故障，二话没说，搁下拐棍，找了双大水靴把肿得胖胖的脚塞了进去。那人连忙劝阻：“只要你给我出个点子，我们就可把它修好，雨大你就别去了！”“同志，机器好似人的肚子，如果得了阑尾炎，叫一个不懂医术的人去开刀，反而会加重病情，以致丧失性命！”说着便一颠一拐地直奔井场而去。那工人一看劝不住，只好到宿舍拿了雨衣给他披上，架着他一同到了井场。当夜李自新和同志们干到天亮，修好了机器。这时，他的双腿已被水泡得更粗了。雨过天晴，太阳从东方徐徐升起。李自新脸上显出无限的喜悦，他慢慢地一颠一拐地走回了宿舍。
