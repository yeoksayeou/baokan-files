    Editor's Note: Comrade Mai Xiande's heroic deeds have moved many people. Where does his proletarian backbone spirit and great strength come from? In a nutshell, it comes from Mao Zedong Thought. Today, we have selected a few stories of Mai Xiande. Although these stories only reflect certain fragments of his work, study, and life, even from these fragments, we can see that Mai Xiande usually reads Chairman Mao's books, listens to Chairman Mao's words, and creatively studies and applies Chairman Mao's works. Why was he able to stubbornly persist in fighting even when he suffered severe injuries and fell into a coma during combat? Why was he able to maintain a clear and firm revolutionary will and a noble and bright spiritual realm? This is a miracle in medical history. This miracle is the location of the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are capable of transforming the old world and creating miracles!
    Constantly Thinking About Fighting a War
    The autumn morning in the South still has a bit of chill.
    The soldiers are neatly arranged, preparing for damage control and leak-stopping experiments. The instructor vigorously strikes the outer shell of the experimental boat with a wooden stick and immediately orders: "Engine room hit by a shell and flooding, one, two, three, four stop the leak! Ensure the safety of the ship and completely eliminate the enemy!"
    Mai Xiande jumps into the engine room like a little tiger, rushing towards the leaking hole spraying seawater. He picks up the leak-stopping box and pushes it up, and the icy seawater splashes directly onto him.
    Mai Xiande and his comrades are operating intensely. Suddenly, they hear the instructor shout: "The leak-stopping box is leaking!" He quickly grabs a leak-stopping pad. Unexpectedly, the instructor shouts again: "All leak-stopping equipment is completely damaged!" Mai Xiande is taken aback, immediately pounces over, turns around, and uses his back to block the leaking hole. The spraying seawater is blocked outside the boat.
    A successful exercise concludes. The instructor says to Mai Xiande: "The leak-stopping pad was broken, you could have taken off your clothes and plugged it up!" Mai Xiande replies: "That would have been a few seconds slower." The instructor is very satisfied and praises Mai Xiande as "a new fighter who is constantly thinking about fighting a war!"
    (Editor's Note: It is commendable that Mai Xiande treats the exercise seriously and proceeds from actual combat in everything he does. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The world fears the word 'serious', and the Communist Party is the most 'serious'." Practicing for war, being serious in peacetime, constantly thinking about the enemy, and thinking about fighting a war, can cultivate solid skills; then, when the enemy comes, they can seriously taste the taste of the Chinese people's iron fists!)

    编者按：麦贤得同志的战斗事迹，使许多人受到感动。他那种无产阶级硬骨头精神，那种伟大的力量是从哪里来的？用一句话来概括，来自毛泽东思想。今天，我们选登了几个麦贤得的故事，这些故事虽然只反映了他工作、学习、生活的某些片断，但即使从这些片断里，我们也可以看出：麦贤得平时读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，活学活用毛主席著作。为什么他在作战中受了严重创伤、陷入昏迷状态时，还能顽强地坚持战斗？还能保持清醒而又坚定的革命意志、崇高而又明朗的精神境界？这在医学史上是奇迹。这奇迹，就是毛泽东思想伟大力量之所在。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是能够改造旧世界、创造出奇迹的人！
    时刻想到打仗
    南方秋天的早晨，还有几分寒意。
    战士们排列整齐，准备进行损管堵漏实验。教员用木棒在实验艇的外壳上猛力一击，立即下令：“机舱中弹进水，一二三四名堵漏！保证舰艇安全，彻底消灭敌人！”
    麦贤得象小老虎一般跳进机舱，冲向喷射着海水的漏口，他拿起堵漏箱顶上去，冰凉的海水哗哗地直射到他身上来。
    麦贤得和战友们正紧张地操作。忽听教员喊道：“堵漏箱漏水！”他急忙拿过一个堵漏垫。那知教员又喊道：“所有堵漏器材全部损坏！”麦贤得一打愣，马上扑过去，一转身，用脊背顶住了漏口。喷射的海水被挡在艇外。
    一场成功的演习结束了。教员对麦贤得说：“堵漏垫坏了，你可以脱掉衣服堵上去呀！”麦贤得回答：“那样要慢几秒钟了。”教员听了十分满意，夸奖麦贤得“是个时刻想到打仗的新战士！”
      （编者插话：麦贤得认真对待演习，处处从实战出发，这一点很可贵。毛泽东同志说过：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’”。练为战，平时认真，时刻想到敌人，想到打仗，就能练出过硬本领；那么，敌人来了，就能让他们认真尝尝中国人民铁拳头的味道！）
