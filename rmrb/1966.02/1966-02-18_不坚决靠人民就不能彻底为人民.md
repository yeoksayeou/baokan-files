    Without Firmly Relying on the People, We Cannot Thoroughly Serve the People
    We must be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, following Chairman Mao's teachings, not fearing hardship, going deep into reality, going deep among the masses, and thoroughly understanding the laws; we must be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, resolutely relying on the masses, and arming the masses with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle.
    On the road to revolutionization, Comrade Jiao Yulu's life has set a glorious example for us.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu spent just over a year, through arduous and meticulous investigation and research, to forge a path in Lankao County to fundamentally control the "three harms" of waterlogging, wind and sand, and salinity, and to change the face of Lankao. I have been in charge of leadership work in Qingyuan County for more than ten years. In recent years, although I have also stayed at selected spots and conducted some investigations and research, I have done so with too many preconceived notions, relying too much on secondhand materials. I still haven't found a way to build Qingyuan. Because I don't have a "final draft" in my mind, I naturally can't make accurate decisions or find a guiding star. I focus on current production and neglect basic farmland construction; I focus on afforestation and neglect water management and field construction. My work often follows in other people's footsteps, addressing everything at once without grasping the fundamental problems, so the backward situation changes slowly, and grain production is unstable and not high. In the past, I thought I was already serving the people well, and if someone criticized me, I wouldn't consciously accept it. After studying Jiao Yulu's deeds, I realized that without starting from reality, without addressing the fundamental aspects, it's not really serving the people completely and thoroughly. Only by being like Jiao Yulu, seriously studying Chairman Mao's works, following Chairman Mao's teachings, not fearing hardship, thoroughly understanding the laws, grasping the main contradictions, and taking practical and effective measures, can we truly and completely serve the people.
    When Comrade Jiao Yulu arrived in Lankao, he saw hope in the difficulties and saw favorable conditions in the unfavorable ones, thus arousing the revolutionary spirit of the cadres and masses throughout the county and mobilizing everyone's enthusiasm, quickly achieving significant results. In recent years, our county's grain production has gradually increased somewhat, many trees have been planted, and preliminary progress has been made in mountainous area construction. Regarding these achievements, I didn't say it aloud, but I felt in my heart that it was almost enough. As for the slow increase in grain production in recent years, I didn't look for the reasons from the county committee's leadership, but instead blamed "Heaven" for going against people. Because of this state of mind of not seeing problems in the face of achievements and not pointing out the direction forward in the face of difficulties, it's impossible to lead the vast numbers of party members, cadres, and masses throughout the county to continuously make discoveries, inventions, and creations in the struggle to build the mountainous areas.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu had all the people in his heart, but only not himself. He loved the people and served the people, not by treating the county committee office as a supply department, simply busy distributing unified sales grain, loans, and relief funds, etc., but in difficult situations, he cared for and helped the masses solve their current living difficulties, and also paid special attention to discovering and establishing models, using the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle to arm the masses throughout the county, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, and relying on the masses' own strength to overcome the "three harms," change the face of the county, and fundamentally eliminate disasters. In my actual work, I didn't fully realize this point. When the masses encountered difficulties in production and life after the disaster, out of my concern for the masses, I also constantly talked about self-reliance in overcoming difficulties, but in specific work, I still reached out to the state on the one hand, asking for grain, loans, and relief money and goods; and on the other hand, I seized some quick-fix sideline measures to solve immediate problems. Of course, these are also needed, but I haven't found the fundamental path of relying on the masses' own strength to solve difficulties. Therefore, in these years, I have always been working with the motive of loving the people, with a "patronizing viewpoint" and the idea of immediate benefits. As a result, the state bears a considerable burden, but the problem has not been fundamentally solved. If someone had criticized me before for loving the people but not relying on the people, and that in essence, I was not completely and thoroughly serving the people, I would have felt extremely wronged. Learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, I woke up with a start. From now on, I must build my love for the people on the ideological foundation of relying on the people, take politics as the commander, give full play to the masses' unlimited creativity, launch a struggle to transform the world against nature, achieve stable and high yields, and completely get rid of the poverty left over from history.

    不坚决靠人民就不能彻底为人民
    要象焦裕禄同志那样，遵照毛主席的教导，不怕艰苦，深入实际，深入群众，摸透规律；要像焦裕禄同志那样，坚决依靠群众，用自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神武装群众。
    在革命化的道路上，焦裕禄同志的一生，为我们树立了一个光辉的榜样。
    焦裕禄同志仅仅用一年多的时间，经过艰苦细致的调查研究，就在兰考县杀出一条根治内涝、风沙、盐碱“三害”、改变兰考面貌的路子来。我在清原县担负领导工作已十年多，近年，虽然也蹲了点，也搞了些调查研究，但是带框框去的多，靠过手材料多，仍然没踩出个建设清原的路子来。自己心里没有“准稿子”，自然就打不准主意，拿不准定盘星。抓了当前生产，撂掉了农田基本建设；抓了造林，放松了治水修田。做工作常常是沿着别人脚窝走，眉毛胡子一把抓，根本问题没有得到很好解决，落后面貌改变得慢，粮食产量不稳不高。过去认为，已经为人民服务得不错了，如果有人批评我，我是不会自觉接受的。学了焦裕禄的事迹，认识到不从实际出发，不从根本方面下手，不是多快好省，为人民服务就不能说是完全彻底了。只有象焦裕禄那样，认真学习毛主席著作，遵照毛主席的教导，不怕艰苦，摸透规律，抓住主要矛盾，从实际出发，采取切实有效措施，才真正是完全彻底的为人民服务。
    焦裕禄同志到了兰考，从困难中看到了希望，从不利条件中看到了有利条件，从而振起了全县干部和群众的革命精神，调动了大家的积极性，很快就取得了重大成果。几年来，我们县的粮食产量逐步有所提高，树也栽了不少，山区建设有了初步进展，对这些成绩，我嘴里不说，内心却觉着差不多了。对于粮食产量几年来提高缓慢，却不从县委领导方面找原因，反而责怪“天老爷”跟人作对。由于存在这种在成绩面前看不出问题，在困难面前指不出前进方向的无所作为的精神状态，就不可能带动全县广大党员、干部、群众，在建设山区的斗争中不断有所发现、有所发明、有所创造、有所前进了。
    焦裕禄同志的心里装着全体人民，唯独没有他自己。他爱人民，为人民，并不是把县委机关当成供给部，单纯地忙着发统销粮、贷款、救济款等等，而是在困难的情况中，既关心帮助群众解决当前的生活困难，又特别重视去发现和树立样板，用自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，武装全县群众，尤其是贫下中农，依靠群众自己的力量去战胜“三害”，改变面貌，从根本上解除灾难。而我在实际工作中，没有完全意识到这点。当灾后群众生产生活遇到困难的时候，我出于关心群众的感情，也不断讲要自力更生战胜困难，但在具体工作中，还是一面向国家伸手，要粮、要贷款、要救济钱物；一面抓些打快拳的副业措施，去解决燃眉之急。当然这些也是需要的，但是没有找到依靠群众自己力量去解决困难这条根本路子。因而，这些年来，自己一直是本着爱人民的动机，带着“恩赐观点”和现得利的想法在工作，结果是国家负担不少，问题却没有从根本上解决。如果以前有人批评我爱人民而不靠人民，实质不是完全彻底地为人民服务，那我会感到委屈万分。学焦裕禄同志，我猛醒过来，今后一定要把爱人民建立在靠人民的思想基础上，以政治为统帅，充分发挥群众的无限创造力，向大自然展开改天换地的斗争，实现稳产高产，彻底摆脱历史上遗留下来的贫困状态。
