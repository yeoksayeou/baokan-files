    How should we treat the word "I"? - This is a yardstick that can test what kind of world view is in a person's mind: the proletarian world view or the bourgeois world view.
    How did Comrade Jiao Yulu treat this word "I"?
      "He had all the people in his heart, but not himself." On the issues of personal comfort, personal enjoyment, personal gain or loss, and personal safety, Jiao Yulu was "selfless," forgetting "I" completely, so that not even a shadow of "I" could be found.
    This "selfless" spirit is the spirit of "utter devotion to others without any thought of self," the spirit of "being wholly selfless and dedicated to the public," and the spirit of proletarian collectivism.
    In other matters, Comrade Jiao Yulu was "having self": if there were heavy burdens, I would take them; if there were difficulties to overcome, I would do it; if it was about caring for the masses, it was my duty; if it was about helping comrades, it was my obligation. Faced with these things, the first thing he thought of was "I", "leading by example," running ahead, and doing his best.
    This "having self" attitude is an attitude of high responsibility for the revolutionary cause, an attitude of "taking the world as one's own responsibility," and an attitude of wholeheartedly serving the people.
    In Comrade Jiao Yulu, the "selflessness" on personal issues and the "having self" on revolutionary cause are so naturally unified and harmoniously combined. This is not surprising, because this "selflessness" and this "having self" are based on a common ideological foundation. This idea is: serving the people wholeheartedly. "Selflessness" in one kind of issue and "having self" in another is precisely the two expressions of one kind of thought; they are "two-in-one". "Selflessness" means forgetting the "small self"; "having self" means having the revolutionary "I," the "I" of the people's servant. Comrade Jiao Yulu's exemplary deeds tell us: only those who completely forget the "small self" can have "I" in the revolutionary cause at all times and in all things; if they have "I" in the revolutionary cause at all times and in all things, they will throw the "small self" to the winds.
    On what issues to be "selfless" and on what issues to be "having self" reflects people's different world views. Putting "I" first in personal gains and losses, and "forgetting" "I"'s responsibilities and "I"'s obligations in doing things for the people, this is a reflection of the bourgeois world view. Being "selfless" in personal matters and always "having self" for the revolution is a manifestation of the proletarian world view.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's attitude towards the word "I" shines with the strong brilliance of the proletarian world view!

    “忘我”和“有我”
    二赞焦裕禄
    先闻
    如何对待一个“我”字？——这是一把标尺，它能检验出一个人的头脑里装着的是什么样的世界观：无产阶级的世界观，还是资产阶级的世界观。
    焦裕禄同志是如何对待这个“我”字的呢？
      “心里装着全体人民，唯独没有他自己。”焦裕禄在对待个人的安逸，个人的享受，个人的得失，个人的安危这些问题上，他是“忘我”的，把“我”忘得干干净净，“我”的一点影子也找不到。
    这种“忘我”精神，就是“毫无自私自利之心”的精神，就是“毫不利己专门利人”的精神，就是无产阶级大公无私的精神。
    在另外一些事情上，焦裕禄同志却又是“有我”的：重担子么，我来挑；克服困难么，我来干；关心群众么，我的职责；帮助同志么，我的义务。面临这些事情，他首先想到的就是“我”，“身先士卒”，跑在前头，尽自己最大的力量。
    这种“有我”的态度，就是对革命事业有高度责任感的态度，就是“以天下为己任”的态度，就是全心全意为人民服务的态度。
    在焦裕禄同志的身上，对个人问题的“忘我”和对革命事业的“有我”，统一得是那么自然，结合得是那么和谐。这并不奇怪，因为，这种“忘我”和这种“有我”，是建立在一个共同的思想基础之上的。这个思想，就是：一心为人民。这一类问题上“忘我”，另一类事情上“有我”，正是一种思想的两种表现，它们是“两位一体”。“忘我”，“忘”的是“小我”；“有我”，“有”的是革命的“我”，人民勤务员的“我”。焦裕禄同志的模范事迹告诉我们：只有彻底“忘”掉“小我”的人，才能够在革命事业上时时事事“有我”，如果在革命事业上事事时时“有我”，那就会把“小我”抛到九霄云外。
    在什么问题上“忘我”，在什么问题上“有我”，反映人们不同的世界观。对个人得失“我”字当头，在为人民出力的事情上就“忘”掉“我”的责任，“我”的义务，这是资产阶级世界观的反映。在个人问题上“忘我”，为革命时时“有我”，这是无产阶级世界观的表现。
    焦裕禄同志对待“我”字的态度，闪烁着强烈的无产阶级世界观的光辉！
