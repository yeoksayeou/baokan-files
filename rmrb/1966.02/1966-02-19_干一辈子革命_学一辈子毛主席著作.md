    Revolutionize for Life, Study Chairman Mao's Writings for Life
    Report by Comrade Tian Fenglin, Political Instructor and Chief of the Delivery Section of the Hohhot Municipal Postal and Telecommunications Bureau (Abstract)
    (Xinhua News Agency, February 18th) Tian Fenglin, a representative of advanced figures from the national industrial and transportation front, a model political instructor in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings, and the political instructor and chief of the Delivery Section of the Hohhot Municipal Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, delivered a report at the enlarged meeting of the National Industrial and Transportation Work Conference and the National Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference on the 17th. The title of the report was "Revolutionize for Life, Study Chairman Mao's Writings for Life." The abstract is as follows:
    Editor's Note: The moving story of Comrade Tian Fenglin transforming the backward Delivery Section into an advanced unit is an outstanding example of politics commanding professional work. Practice yields experience. Tian Fenglin, accumulating several years of experience, summarized the following five points: "To grasp professional work, one must first grasp politics; to grasp politics, one must first grasp ideology; to grasp ideology, one must first grasp the study of Chairman Mao's writings; in studying Chairman Mao's writings, one must put effort into the word 'application'; and to grasp the word 'application,' one must first grasp the transformation of thought."
    Using Mao Zedong Thought to transform people's thinking is the core issue of highlighting politics. People are the decisive factor in all work. Without a change in people's mental outlook, there will be no change in the work's appearance. The reason why the Delivery Section's work was backward in the past was because of the lack of enthusiasm in people's spirit at that time; the reason why the Delivery Section's work is now advanced is because people's spirit has changed.
    Grasping revolution and promoting production, from the perspective of ideological and political work on people, means grasping people's ideological revolution; without the ideological revolution, there will be no revolutions in production technology and other aspects. "To grasp the word 'application,' one must first grasp the transformation of thought," landing the creative study and application of Mao Zedong Thought on changing people's mental state, landing it on improving people's consciousness, this is the core of all the experience Tian Fenglin has gained.
    "To persuade others, first persuade yourself." To transform people, first transform yourself. Without first transforming your own thinking, how is it possible to transform the thinking of others? Tian Fenglin said well: "Cadres only have one special characteristic, and that is to endure hardship before enjoying comfort; other than that, there should be no other special privileges." Leaders first and foremost highlight politics in everything they do and strictly demand themselves, and in this way, they can lead the entire team.
    Our Delivery Section currently has 55 employees, undertaking the delivery tasks of 32 delivery routes, 200 streets and alleys, and over 900 government units in Hohhot City. We travel more than 1,500 li every day, with an average daily workload of over 1.3 million items.
    Before 1961, due to a lack of emphasis on politics and insufficient command with Mao Zedong Thought, we were known as the "Four-Often Section"—errors often occurred, accidents often happened, users often complained, and the masses often criticized. After 1962, under the leadership of the Party, we creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's writings and vigorously grasped people's ideological and political work, which brought about changes in the mental outlook and work style of the entire Delivery Section's employees. The entire section has not had an accident for 970 consecutive days. Since 1962, we have been rated as an advanced unit for four consecutive years, and last year we were rated as an advanced unit in studying Chairman Mao's writings.
    The process of transforming the backward state of the Delivery Section is the process of our creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings. I deeply realize that to engage in revolution for a lifetime, one must read Chairman Mao's writings for a lifetime, and one must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fight against non-proletarian ideology for a lifetime.
    I started reading Chairman Mao's books in 1956. Over the past nine years, I have read the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" thoroughly. Articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "On Practice" have been read more than 30 times, and I have written more than 90,000 words of notes and心得 (xinde - insights gained). What follows is how I and my comrades creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's writings, constantly transforming our thinking in the practice of transforming the objective world with Mao Zedong Thought.
    (1) Grasp the Main Contradiction
    When I first started working in the Delivery Section, this section was a backward unit in the entire bureau, with many contradictions and complex problems, and the quality of delivery was not high. I was unsure where to start. After rereading "On Contradiction," and according to Chairman Mao's teaching that one must grasp the main contradiction in work, I analyzed the problems of the Delivery Section, and the main problem was in people's thinking. For whom to labor? For whom to deliver letters? This fundamental question had not been resolved. Young delivery workers generally believed that delivery work was unpromising, that they were like "street criers" all day long, feeling inferior to others. They had three fears: fear of losing face, fear of being called "postmen," and fear of not finding a spouse. Among some older employees, the idea of "working for food, earning money to support the family" was more common, and they took a mercenary view, "tolling the bell as long as they are monks." These ideas were reflected in their work as a lack of responsibility, poor service attitude, and constant errors and accidents.
    (2) Start with Class Education
    How to resolve this main contradiction? I realized that if a person wants to know for whom to labor, they must start by studying Chairman Mao's writings. Therefore, I started by organizing all the section's employees to study Chairman Mao's writings and arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought.
    As soon as learning was mentioned, some people said, "Even if a letter deliverer has high theories, they can't deliver the letter in a fancy way." Some said, "I'm old, have little education, and can't learn." I realized that this was mainly due to everyone's insufficient understanding of the great significance of studying Chairman Mao's writings. I repeatedly publicized the importance of studying Chairman Mao's writings to everyone, and at the same time, I took the lead in studying and applying them well, introducing my own learning experiences and methods to everyone.
    Class education is the key to inspiring everyone's consciousness in studying Chairman Mao's writings, and it is the stepping stone to guiding everyone to study Chairman Mao's writings with class feelings. I first organized everyone to conduct忆苦思甜 (yiku sitian - recall bitterness and think about sweetness) in conjunction with studying "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society." All the section's employees studied this article six times, conducted忆苦思甜 (yiku sitian - recall bitterness and think about sweetness) three times, and each time the shock was greater than the last. When everyone read Chairman Mao's analysis of poor peasants, hired peasants, and the proletariat, some old workers who had suffered in the old society rushed to speak. They recalled the oppression and exploitation they had suffered in the old society, and they were all in tears, which deeply moved the young workers. One young delivery worker, a high school student, used to look down on delivery work, but after six studies and three忆苦 (yiku - recalling bitterness), he received a profound class education, raised his awareness, and said, "I am living in a honey pot, and I don't know the sweetness of honey all over my body. In the future, I will definitely listen to the Party, use my energy in my work, and be a people's postman for life."
    The deeper the class hatred is recalled, the higher the class consciousness is gradually raised, and the stronger the class feelings for Chairman Mao's books are produced. Everyone said, "Chairman Mao's books are revolutionary books, and if you want to make revolution, you must read Chairman Mao's books."
    (3) Resolve the Issue of Laboring for Whom
    After the consciousness of learning was raised, I went back and organized everyone to study articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" in depth, focusing on resolving the issue of laboring for whom and delivering letters for whom. In the past, delivery workers regarded a letter as a trivial matter worth eight cents, and it didn't matter if they delivered it a little earlier or later, and it was nothing to lose one or two letters. After studying, they realized that: a letter, a heart, every letter is worth a thousand pounds, hearts connect with letters, letters connect with hearts, and delivery workers are the people who connect hearts. Since 1963, more than 6,500 "dead" letters with names but no addresses have been delivered, enabling a father and son who had not had news of each other for 17 years to communicate, and allowing sisters who had been separated for more than 30 years to reunite. Users wrote letters thanking the Party and Chairman Mao, calling the delivery workers "living Lei Fengs."
    Through the practice of organizing employees to study Chairman Mao's writings, I deeply realized that: to grasp professional work, one must first grasp politics; to grasp politics, one must first grasp ideology; to grasp ideology, one must first grasp the study of Chairman Mao's writings; in studying Chairman Mao's writings, one must put effort into the word "application"; and to grasp the word "application," one must first grasp the transformation of thought.
    How do we use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to do the work of grasping living ideas and thoughts to the production process, to the daily life of employees, and to the families of employees?
    (1) Do Ideological Work in the Production Process
    Grasping production starts with ideology, grasping ideology starts from production, and doing ideological work in the production process, ensuring the rapid, accurate, safe, and convenient completion of postal and telecommunications tasks, this is the starting point and end point of our ideological work. To achieve this, we must highlight politics and use politics to command professional work.
    When I first arrived at the Delivery Section, I considered bonuses and systems more and considered human factors less, so I ran into snags. We introduced a method of assessing work points and rewarding people, stipulating the scores for completing output, time limits, and quality indicators, even adding a few points for going to the suburbs to open a mailbox on behalf of someone. Despite the detailed regulations, the production tasks were still not completed well, and the ideological problems of the employees increased instead. Once, because the car broke down, it did not bring back the "Inner Mongolia Daily." I mobilized the employees to ride their bicycles to the newspaper office to get the newspapers. Some employees asked, "How many points do you get for carrying a bundle of newspapers?" I thought: Comrade Norman Bethune was a Canadian doctor who, for the liberation cause of the Chinese people, was not afraid of hardship, came to China from afar, and dedicated his life. Comrade Zhang Side did many good deeds throughout his life. Who assessed their work and recorded their points? At this time, I felt that using material incentives to mobilize the production enthusiasm of employees would only encourage selfish and individualistic ideas, leading employees astray. What should I do? I again sought guidance from Chairman Mao's writings, organized everyone to study the deeds of Zhang Side and Norman Bethune, and enlightened everyone to do their work well for the revolution. At the same time, I paid attention to ideological education in my work, so that the consciousness of the masses slowly improved. Later, there were no people who wanted to divide the work, and there were more people who grabbed the work; the phenomenon of competing for bonuses at the end of the month disappeared, and there were more people who checked their own shortcomings during the evaluation. The method of assessing work points and rewarding people did not need to be abolished, and it stopped working. From this incident, I further realized that: without solving people's ideological problems, without improving people's political consciousness and revolutionary awareness, no system will work. Only by commanding with Mao Zedong Thought and putting the human factor first can the enthusiasm of employees be mobilized to the greatest extent. Using material incentives and systems to control people is taking the evil road of capitalism and must be resolutely opposed.
    After I realized the importance of grasping living ideas and thoughts in the production process, I further explored some regular patterns of the impact of production activities on people's thinking, and did ideological work ahead of time. For example, at the beginning of the month, the delivery routes change greatly, and errors can easily occur with a slight oversight; at the end of the month, there is a tendency to produce complacency and a sigh of relief, and a slackening of effort will cause problems; on holidays and public holidays, many units change their senders and receivers, there are many pedestrians on the road, and attention needs to be paid to strict delivery and careful counting and traffic safety; it is difficult to deliver letters in windy and rainy weather, and it is necessary to encourage everyone to dare to meet difficulties and overcome difficulties to ensure the completion of tasks, and so on. Doing ideological work at this time is both help and care, both a reminder and an encouragement, and can have an immediate effect.
    (2) Do Ideological Work in the Daily Life of Employees
    Chairman Mao said: "All the actual livelihood problems of the masses are issues that we should pay attention to." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, I regard caring about the hardships of employees and helping them solve practical difficulties as an indispensable part of ideological and political work.
    Since I was transferred to work in the Delivery Section, I have lived with the masses for a long time. When some employees are sick, I have to get up in the middle of the night to cover the patient with a quilt, give them medicine, and cook meals; when they are seriously ill and in a hurry, I carry the patient to the hospital; after the illness, they need to recuperate, and I save money from my own frugal life to take care of the patient. No matter who has difficulties, I care for them with class feelings and help them solve them.
    There are many young employees in the Delivery Section, and some single young workers spend money relatively casually, loosely in the first half of the month and tightly in the second half of the month, and some only care about eating and drinking and owe debts. I used Chairman Mao's teachings on diligence and thrift and hard work to educate these comrades, help them draw up expenditure plans, and deposit the surplus money in the bank. After eight months, these single employees had savings in the bank.
    (3) Do Ideological Work in the Families of Employees
    I believe that production is the front line, and the family is the second line. Whether the work on the front line is good or not depends to a large extent on the support of the second line. Quarrels between husband and wife, disputes with neighbors, and disharmony among family members will directly affect the emotions of employees. For more than three years, I have generally visited the families of the 49 employees in our section, helping them solve practical problems on the one hand, and doing ideological work and class education on the other hand, enlightening their consciousness. Delivery worker Li Mingxin has been an advanced producer for three consecutive years and is also the leader of the delivery team. Sometimes, because he is busy with work, he comes home late and does not take care of much housework. His wife had a lot of opinions, quarreled with him, and even threatened to divorce. After I discovered this, I took the initiative to go to Li Mingxin's house to mediate and enlighten his wife's class consciousness. I said, "Your family used to have three people, one quilt, no food to eat, and no clothes to wear. Now, there is food to eat, clothes to wear, and a radio on the table. Where did this come from?" Li's wife said, "It's all thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." I told her that because of this, we should work harder, and Lao Li is working so actively, so he has been rated as an advanced producer for three consecutive years. At the same time, I pointed out to her that Li Mingxin's becoming an advanced producer is inseparable from her support. After mediation, Li's wife was in a good mood and cared more about Li Mingxin, and Lao Li's work enthusiasm was even greater than before.
    In order to educate the families of employees to actively support their loved ones in doing their work well, sometimes the families are also invited to attend the commendation meetings, so that they can understand the work situation of their loved ones, and the achievements of the families are also fully commended at the meeting.
    There were originally seven or eight employees in the Delivery Section whose families had financial difficulties, and they always needed to be subsidized. I visited these families, organized them to engage in sideline occupations, and educated them to be diligent and thrifty in managing their families. Now, five or six families not only do not need subsidies, but also have savings.
    Because I care about the families of employees, the families are also familiar with me and say everything to me, which provides me with good conditions for timely understanding the ideological dynamics of employees and doing ideological work well.
    (4) Cultivate the Advanced and Help the Backward Become Advanced
    To do ideological and political work well and continuously expand the ranks of advanced producers, we must help the advanced to become more advanced and help the backward to become advanced. When the ranks of the advanced are expanded, the mental outlook of the entire unit will be vigorous and the work will be done better and better.
    On the one hand, the advanced comrades are warmly encouraged, and on the other hand, they are strictly required. The backward comrades should be treated in two, we must treat the backward comrades with a strong class affection, warmly care for them, and patiently help them. I believe that helping a comrade transform into the advanced ranks is adding a force to socialist construction.
    Old worker Guo Yuming in the Delivery Section was originally a well-known backward employee in the entire bureau, and people called him "the person who wouldn't help even if the oil bottle fell." Based on his many years of experience, he predicted that the weather would be bad, so he would excuse headaches and stomachaches to ask for leave, and he could not attend work full time every month. When Guo Yuming asked for leave, some comrades also said that they had headaches and stomachaches and did not go to work. After we made a comprehensive analysis of Guo Yuming, we saw that Guo Yuming was born poor, had been a postman in the old society for half his life, and had suffered all kinds of exploitation and oppression. It was just that he had spent a long time in the old society and was more deeply influenced by the old consciousness. For such comrades, we must firmly grasp class education and do meticulous ideological work. Guo Yuming's family had a large population and a heavy living burden, and his own health was indeed poor. I often visited his home, helped him solve his living difficulties, asked him about his health, and gave him the necessary care in his work. When there was a strong wind or heavy rain, I always took the initiative to take his shift. Once, I braved the heavy rain to take Guo Yuming's shift and came back soaked all over. When Guo Yuming saw this situation, he said to me excitedly, "When I was a temporary postman in the old society, I would be scolded if I came back a little late. I have never seen a section chief deliver letters for workers!" I said, "We are class brothers and sisters, our hearts are connected, and we should help each other and care for each other." Once, I went to his home and found that his wife and children were sick, and he was having trouble because he had no money. I promptly reported this situation to the organization, and the trade union gave him financial assistance. Guo Yuming took the money, and his eyes were full of tears, saying, "In the old society, my mother got sick and had no money to treat her, so she died on the kang, and there was no money to buy a coffin..." He grabbed my hand and cried, "I hate myself for not making progress too late. Watch me from now on!" I also guided him to study Chairman Mao's writings. After Guo Yuming studied "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," he examined himself and said, "I have lived in vain for decades in the past. From now on, I can only work day and night to do more for the people." Since then, he has been rushing to work, and people praised him as "broadly managed" and "relentless". In the past, he often asked for leave when he was not sick. Now, he has been attending work full time for three consecutive years. In the past, he often sent "live" letters to "dead" letters. Now, he revives "dead" letters. Since 1963, he has revived more than 900 "dead" letters alone. Guo Yuming has been rated as an advanced producer in the entire bureau for two consecutive years, and in 1965, he was also rated as an activist in studying Chairman Mao's writings in Hohhot City.
    In the past three years, our Delivery Section has cultivated a total of 20 advanced producers, 11 of whom have transformed from backward to advanced.
    (5) Rely on the Organization, Mobilize the Masses, and Everyone Does Ideological Work
    As the secretary of the Party branch, I first focused on mobilizing Party members to do ideological and political work. At every Party branch meeting of the Delivery Section, the study of ideological and political work is put first. Specifically, Party members are organized to contract work in divisions, make friends with employees, do good deeds, and do ideological work. At the same time, we pay attention to relying on the administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League, giving play to the role of each organization, and requiring them to highlight politics and ideological leadership no matter what they do; to measure how well their work is done, the first thing to look at is the political effect.
    In daily work, we use Party members as the core, and organize Party members, trade union and Communist Youth League cadres, political propagandists, and team leaders into a backbone team for ideological and political work. We hold regular meetings to convey the spirit of the higher authorities, study work methods, bring the spirit of the higher authorities down, and bring the ideological situation of the masses up through them. After analysis and research, we solve the problems separately. Because everyone cares about the ideological progress of comrades and everyone does ideological work, every change in the thinking of employees can generally be reflected to the leadership in a timely manner.
    The leading role of cadres is an authoritative call and a silent command. Without the proletarian ideology and style of cadres, a revolutionized workforce cannot be brought out. I always ring the alarm for myself: I cannot lose the true colors of the working class, I cannot separate myself from labor, I cannot forget that I am an ordinary worker, and I cannot separate myself from the masses.
    When I came to the Delivery Section, I heard some comrades say, "You can't go up the mountain when the wind is strong, and you can't go down the river when the rain is heavy." One night, I was studying "On Practice," and Chairman Mao said, "'How can you catch tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den?'" I thought, yes! The comrades said that you can't go up the mountain when the wind is strong. If you don't go and see for yourself, you don't have the right to speak. So, I chose a windy day to take a shift and went up the Daqing Mountain. The wind was a level eight gale that day. It was okay to ride a bicycle in the city, but as soon as I left the city, I couldn't ride the bicycle anymore. I had to push it. Later, when I didn't have the strength to push it, I took a break and pushed it for a while, and finally went up the mountain. I thought, it is really difficult to go up the mountain when the wind is blowing. Maybe it's because I'm going up for the first time. It may not be so difficult if it grows longer. After that, I went up the mountain when the wind was strong and went down the river when the rain was heavy. After more than a dozen experiences, I figured out how much wind can go up the mountain, how much rain can go down the river, and I also have a basis for persuading comrades. Through personal practice, I know which opinions of the masses are right and which are wrong, and I will not make subjective mistakes when dealing with problems.
    Since 1962, I have participated in labor for a total of more than 880 days, an average of more than 250 days a year. In labor, I became familiar with all 32 sections of the city, and I can take a shift on every section. I strictly demand myself in terms of the quality of delivery services, and I first demand that I am qualified and have never made mistakes. The comrades call me "Master Tian." In fact, the masses are truly my masters. I have eaten, lived, and worked with them for so many years, and I have learned many things. The most important harvest is that I have realized a truth: to persuade others, first persuade yourself; you must first do what you want others to do. Combining doing and saying, with doing as the main thing, setting an example for employees everywhere. Cadres only have one special feature, that is, enduring hardship before enjoying comfort; other than that, there should be no other special privileges. To achieve these, we must put down our airs, participate in labor, transform our thinking in labor, and promote work, otherwise, we will go the wrong way and make mistakes.
    Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and under the correct leadership of the Party and the higher authorities, although we have done a little work and achieved some results, we still have many shortcomings. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, take the People's Liberation Army and Daqing as examples, continue to highlight politics, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's writings more effectively, strengthen ideological and political work, humbly learn from fraternal units, and do our work better and better.

    干一辈子革命  学一辈子毛主席著作
    呼和浩特市邮电局投递科政治指导员兼科长田凤林同志的报告（摘要）
    据新华社十八日讯　全国工业交通战线先进人物代表、活学活用毛主席著作的模范政治指导员、内蒙古自治区呼和浩特市邮电局投递科政治指导员兼科长田凤林，十七日在全国工业交通工作会议、全国工业交通政治工作会议扩大会议上作了报告，报告题目是《干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席著作》，摘要如下：
    编者按：田凤林同志把投递科这个后进单位改造成为先进单位的动人事迹，是政治统帅业务的一个出色范例。实践出经验。积数年经验的田凤林总结了这样五条：“抓业务必须先抓政治，抓政治必须先抓思想，抓思想必须先抓毛主席著作学习，学习毛主席著作必须从‘用’字上下功夫，抓‘用’字必先抓改造思想。”
    运用毛泽东思想改造人的思想，是突出政治的核心问题。人，是一切工作的决定因素。没有人的思想面貌的改变，就不会有工作面貌的改变。过去投递科的工作所以落后，是因为当时人们的精神状态不振；以后投递科工作先进了，是因为人们的精神状态改变了。
    抓革命促生产，从对人的思想政治工作来说，就是抓人的思想革命；没有思想的革命，就没有生产技术等等方面的革命。“抓‘用’字必先抓改造思想”，把活学活用毛泽东思想落脚在改变人的精神状态上，落脚在提高人的觉悟上，这是田凤林取得的全部经验的核心。
    “要说服别人，先说服自己。”要改造人，先要改造自己。不首先改造自己的思想，怎么可能改造别人的思想？田凤林说得好：“干部只有一条特殊，那就是吃苦在前，享乐在后，除此而外，再不应当有别的特殊。”领导者首先事事时时突出政治，严格要求自己，这样就把整个班子带领起来了。
    我们投递科，现有职工五十五人，担负着呼和浩特市三十二个投递段道、二百条大街小巷、九百多个机关单位的投递任务。每天行程一千五百多华里，每天平均业务量一百三十多万件。
    一九六一年以前，由于没有突出政治，用毛主席思想挂帅不够，被人们称为“四常科”——差错常出现，事故常发生，用户常申告，群众常批评。一九六二年以后，在党的领导下，我们活学活用了毛主席著作，大抓了人的思想政治工作，使整个投递科的职工精神面貌和工作面貌发生了变化，全科连续九百七十天没有发生事故。从一九六二年起，连续四年被评为先进单位，去年被评为学习毛主席著作先进单位。
    改造投递科落后面貌的过程，就是我们活学活用毛主席著作的过程。我深切的体会到：干一辈子革命，就必须读一辈子毛主席著作，就要高举毛泽东思想红旗，和非无产阶级思想斗争一辈子。
    我开始读毛主席的书，是在一九五六年。九年多来，我通读了《毛泽东选集》，其中《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《实践论》等文章，都读过三十遍以上，写了九万多字的笔记心得。下面讲的是我怎样和同志们一起活学活用毛主席著作，用毛主席思想在改造客观世界的实践中不断进行思想改造的。
    （一）抓主要矛盾
    我刚到投递科工作时，这个科是全局的落后单位，科里矛盾很多，问题复杂，投递质量不高。从哪里入手，一时捉摸不定。我再读《矛盾论》，根据毛主席的在工作中要抓主要矛盾的教导，我分析了投递科的问题，主要在人的思想。为谁劳动？为谁送信？这个根本问题没有解决。青年投递员普遍认为：投递工作没出息，成天象个“叫街”的，低人一头。他们有三怕：怕丢人，怕人叫“邮差”，怕找不着爱人。有些老职工当中，“干活吃饭，挣钱养家”的思想较普遍，他们带着雇佣观点，“当一天和尚撞一天钟”。这些思想反映在工作上，就是责任心不强，服务态度不好，差错事故不断发生。
    （二）从阶级教育入手
    怎样解决这个主要矛盾？我体会到，一个人要想知道为谁而劳动，就必须从学习毛主席著作开始。于是，我就从组织全科职工学习毛主席著作开始，用毛泽东思想来武装职工头脑。
    一提起学习，有的人就说：“一个送信的，理论再高也不能把信送出个花样来。”有的说：“我年龄大，文化低，学不了。”我认识到这主要是大家对学习毛主席著作的重大意义认识不足。我就反复地向大家宣传学习毛主席著作的重要意义，同时自己带头学好用好，向大家介绍自己的学习体会和方法。
    阶级教育，是启发大家学习毛主席著作自觉性的钥匙，是引导大家带着阶级感情学习毛主席著作的敲门石。我首先组织大家结合学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》进行忆苦思甜。全科职工六次学了这篇文章，进行了三次忆苦思甜，一次比一次震动大。当大家读到毛主席对贫农、雇农和无产阶级的分析时，一些在旧社会受过苦的老工人都抢着发言。他们回忆起旧社会所受的压迫和剥削，都声泪俱下，使青年工人激动万分。有个青年投递员，是个高中生，过去看不起投递工作，经过六学三忆，受到了深刻的阶级教育，提高了认识，他说：“我是身在蜜罐罐里，浑身是蜜不知甜。今后一定听党的话，把劲头用在工作上，当一辈子人民邮递员。”
    阶级仇恨越忆越深，阶级觉悟也逐步提高，对毛主席的书产生了越来越强烈的阶级感情。大家说：“毛主席的书是革命的书，要革命就必须读毛主席的书。”
    （三）解决为谁劳动问题
    学习自觉性提高了，我回过头来，组织大家深入地学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等文章，集中解决为谁劳动为谁送信的问题。过去，投递员把一封信看成是八分钱的小事，早送晚送一会，丢失一封两封，没啥了不起。学习以后，他们认识到：一封信、一颗心，封封书信重千斤，心连信，信连心，投递员就是连心人。一九六三年以来，投出有名无址的“死”信，就达六千五百多件，曾经使十七年没有通过音信的亲父子沟通了联系，让离散了三十多年的亲姐妹得到团聚。用户来信感谢党和毛主席，称投递员是“活雷锋”。
    通过组织职工学习毛主席著作的实践，我深深地体会到：抓业务必须先抓政治，抓政治必须先抓思想，抓思想必须先抓毛主席著作学习，学习毛主席著作必须从“用”字上下功夫，抓“用”字必先抓改造思想。
    我们是怎样以毛泽东思想为指针，把抓活思想的工作做到生产过程中去，做到职工日常生活中去，做到职工家属中去的呢？
        （一）把思想工作做到生产过程中去
    抓生产从思想入手，抓思想从生产出发，把思想工作做到生产过程中去，保证迅速、准确、安全、方便地完成邮电通信任务，这是我们做思想工作的出发点和落脚点。要做到这一点，就必须突出政治，以政治统帅业务。
    我初到投递科时，曾经考虑奖金、制度多，考虑人的因素少，因此碰了钉子。我们科里搞了个评工计分奖励办法，规定了完成产量、时限、质量指标的分数，连跑郊区代开一个信箱加几分，也做了规定。尽管规定很细，生产任务仍然完成不好，职工的思想问题反倒增多了。有一次，汽车因为发生故障，没有把《内蒙古日报》拉回来，我动员职工骑自行车到报社去取报。有的职工就问：“驮一捆报给几分？”我想：白求恩同志是加拿大的大夫，为中国人民的解放事业，不怕艰苦，不远万里来到中国，献出了自己的生命，张思德同志一生做了许多好事，有谁给他们评过工，记过分呢？这时感到，用物质刺激来调动职工的生产积极性，只会助长自私自利个人主义思想，把职工引到邪路上去。怎么办？我又求教于毛主席著作，组织大家学习张思德、白求恩的事迹，启发大家为革命做好工作，同时，在工作中处处重视思想教育，使群众的觉悟慢慢有了提高。以后，要分的人没有了，抢工作的人多了；月终争奖金的现象没有了，评比时检查自己缺点的人多了。评工计分奖励办法不用宣布废除，就不起作用了。我从这件事进一步认识到：不解决人的思想问题，不提高人的政治觉悟和革命自觉性，什么制度也不起作用，只有毛主席思想挂帅，把人的因素放在第一位，才能把职工的积极性最大限度的调动起来。用物质刺激、制度卡人，是走资本主义的邪路，必须坚决反对。
    我认识到在生产过程中抓活思想的重要意义后，进一步摸索到生产活动变化对人的思想影响的一些规律性，把思想工作做在前边。例如，月初投递报路变动大，稍一疏忽就会出错；月末容易产生麻痹和松一口气的思想，一松劲就会出问题；假日公休，各单位收发换人多，路上行人多，需要注意严交细点和交通安全；风天雨天投递有困难，需要鼓励大家敢于迎接困难和克服困难，保证完成任务，等等。在这时候做思想工作，既是帮助，又是关心，既是提醒，又是鼓动，能收立竿见影之效。
      （二）把思想工作做到职工日常生活中去
    毛主席说：“一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。”按照毛主席的教导，我把关心职工疾苦，帮助职工解决实际困难，当作思想政治工作不可缺少的一个部分。
    我自从调投递科工作以来，长期同群众生活在一起。有的职工病了，深夜我也要起来给病人盖被，吃药，做饭；病重了急了，就背病人进医院；病后需要调养，我自己节衣缩食省下钱来，照顾病人。不论谁有了困难，我都以阶级感情去关心，去帮助解决。
    投递科青年职工多，有的单身青工，花钱比较随便，前半月松，后半月紧，有的只顾吃喝，欠了债。我用毛主席关于勤俭节约，艰苦朴素的教导对这些同志进行教育，帮助他们订出开支计划，把余钱存进银行。经过八个月，这些单身职工在银行里就存有余款了。
      （三）把思想工作做到职工家属中去
    我认为：生产是第一线，家属是第二线，第一线的工作好不好，在很大程度上要看第二线的支援怎么样。夫妻吵架，邻居纠纷，家属不和，都会直接影响到职工的情绪。三年多来，我对本科四十九户职工家属普遍进行了访问，一面帮助她们解决实际问题，一面进行思想工作，进行阶级教育，启发她们的觉悟。投递员李明信是连续三年的先进生产者，又是投递班长。有时因为工作忙，他回家晚些，家务事管得不多。他爱人很有意见，和他争吵，甚至闹着要离婚。我发现后，就主动到李明信家去调解，启发他爱人的阶级觉悟。我说：“你家过去三口人，一床被子，吃不上饭，穿不上衣。现在，吃有吃，穿有穿，桌上放着收音机。这是怎么来的？”李大嫂说：“都是共产党和毛主席领导的好。”我告诉她，正因为这样，就更应该好好地工作，老李就是这样积极地工作，因此连续三年被评为先进生产者的。同时，给她指出，李明信成为先进生产者，是和她的支持分不开的。经过调解，李大嫂心情舒畅，对李明信更加关心，老李的工作劲头比以前更足了。
    为了教育职工家属积极地支持自己亲人做好工作，在召开评比表扬会议时，有时把家属也请来，让她们了解自己亲人的工作情况，并且在会上对职工家属的成绩也作充分的表扬。
    投递科原来有七八户职工，家庭生活有困难，每次补助都少不了他们。我访问了这些家属，组织她们搞副业，教育她们勤俭持家。现在，有五六户不但不需要补助，还有存款。
    由于关心职工家属，家属们对我也不见外，对我无话不说，这给我及时掌握职工思想动态，做好思想工作，提供了很好的条件。
    （四）培养先进，帮助后进变先进
    要做好思想政治工作，不断扩大先进生产者的队伍，就要帮助先进的更先进，帮助落后的变先进。先进队伍扩大了，整个单位的精神面貌就会朝气勃勃，工作就会越作越好。
    对先进的同志，一面是热情鼓励，一面是严格要求。对待后进的同志要一分为二，要怀着强烈的阶级感情，热情地亲近他们，耐心地帮助他们。我认为：能帮助一个同志转变到先进队伍里来，就是给社会主义建设增加了一份力量。
    投递科老工人郭玉明，原来是全局有名的后进职工，人们管他叫“油瓶子倒了也不扶的人”。他凭多年的经验，预料天气不好，就借口头痛、肚子疼请假，月月不能出全勤。郭玉明一请假，有的同志也照样推说头疼肚子疼不上班。我们对郭玉明作了全面分析之后，看到郭玉明出身贫苦，在旧社会干了半辈子邮差，受尽了剥削和压迫，只是在旧社会蹲的时间长，受旧意识影响比较深。对这样的同志，要狠狠抓住阶级教育，做好细致的思想工作。郭玉明家庭人口多，生活负担重，本人身体也确实较差。我经常到他家串门访问，帮助解决生活上的困难，问寒问暖，在工作上也给以必要的照顾，遇到大风大雨天，我总是主动替他出班。有一次，我冒着大雨替郭玉明出班回来，浑身给淋得湿漉漉的。郭玉明看到这种情况，激动地对我说：“我在旧社会当临时邮差，回来晚一点就得挨骂，哪见过科长替工人送信的？”我说：“我们是阶级弟兄，心连心，应该互相帮助，互相关心。”有一次去他家，赶上他爱人和小孩得了病，手头无钱正在为难。我及时向组织上反映了这个情况，并且由工会给了经济上的补助。郭玉明接过钱，两眼泪花花地说：“旧社会我母亲得病没钱治，死在炕上，没钱买棺材。……”他紧抓住我的手，哭着说：“我恨自己进步的太晚，看我今后的吧！”我又引导他学习毛主席著作。当郭玉明学了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》之后，他检查对照了自己，说：“过去自己白活了几十年，今后只有白天加黑夜地干，才能为人民多做点事。”这以后，他抢着干活，人们称赞他是“管得宽”、“闲不住”。过去没病常请假，现在连续三年出满勤。过去常把“活”信送“死”，现在把“死”信复活。一九六三年以来，他一个人就复活“死”信九百多件。郭玉明已经连续两年被评为全局的先进生产者，一九六五年又被评为呼和浩特市学习毛主席著作积极分子。
    三年多来，我们投递科共培养了二十名先进生产者，其中有十一个人是由后进变先进的。
    （五）依靠组织，发动群众，人人做思想工作
    我作为党支部书记，首先对发动党员做思想政治工作抓的紧。投递科每次党支部大会，都把研究思想政治工作放在首位。具体组织党员分工包干，和职工交朋友、做好事、做思想工作。同时，我们注意依靠行政、工会、共青团，发挥各个组织的作用，要求他们无论抓什么都要突出政治，思想领先；衡量他们的工作做得如何，也是首先看政治效果如何。
    在日常工作中，我们以党员为核心，把党员、工会和共青团干部、政治宣传员、班组长组成为思想政治工作的骨干队伍定期召开会议，传达上级精神，研究工作方法，把上头的精神带下去，并通过他们把群众中的思想情况带上来，经过分析研究，分头解决。由于人人关心同志的思想进步，人人做思想工作，所以职工思想发生的每一变化，一般都能及时地反映到领导上来。
    干部带头是权威的号召，无声的命令。干部没有无产阶级的思想作风，就带不出革命化的职工队伍。我时时给自己敲警钟：不能失去工人阶级本色，不能脱离劳动；不能忘掉自己是一个普通劳动者，不能脱离群众。
    我到投递科就听到有些同志说：“风大上不了山，雨大下不了川。”一天晚上，我学习《实践论》，毛主席说：“‘不入虎穴，焉得虎子。’”我一想，对呀！同志们提出风大上不了山，自己不亲自去看看，就没有发言权。于是我选了个大风天替班，上了大青山。这天刮的是八级大风，在城里骑车还行，一出城，车子便骑不动了，只好推着走，后来没力气推了，我就歇一会，推着走一会，终于上了山。心想，刮风上山确实难啊，可能是头一次上的关系，长了也许就不这么费劲了。以后越大风天越上山，越下雨，越下川，经过十几次体验，摸出了多大的风可以上山，多大的雨可以下川，说服同志也有了根据。通过亲自实践，就知道群众的意见，哪些是对的，哪些是不对的，处理问题就不会犯主观主义的错误。
    从一九六二年以来，我一共参加劳动八百八十多天，平均每年都有二百五十天以上。在劳动中，我摸熟了全市的三十二个段道，每一个段道都能上去替班。在投递业务质量上严格要求自己，首先要求自己过硬，没有出过差错，同志们称我为“田师傅”。其实，群众才真正是我的师傅，我和他们吃、住、劳动在一起这么几年，学到了许多东西，其中最重要的收获是，我认识到了一条真理：要说服别人，先说服自己；要人家做到的事，自己要首先做到。做和说相结合，以做为主，处处事事给职工做出样子来。干部只有一条特殊，那就是吃苦在前，享乐在后，除此而外，再不应当有别的特殊。要做到这些，就要放下架子，参加劳动，在劳动中改造思想，推动工作，否则就会走错路，犯错误。
    我们在毛泽东思想的指引下，在党和上级的正确领导下，虽然做了一点点工作，取得了一些成绩，但是我们的缺点还很多，我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以解放军、大庆为榜样，继续突出政治，更有成效地活学活用毛主席著作，加强思想政治工作，虚心向各兄弟单位学习，把我们的工作做得好上加好。
