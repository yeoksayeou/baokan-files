    Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch, New Delhi: The Indian government's incompetence in handling the serious domestic food crisis in India has been strongly condemned by opposition party members in the People's Chamber of the Indian Parliament budget meeting, which opened on the 14th. Even some Congress Party members joined the opposition in criticizing the government's food policy. At the same time, thousands of Indian people held anti-hunger demonstrations outside the venue, protesting the government's food policy.

    Western news agencies, in reporting the noisy and chaotic situation within the Indian Parliament, said that this was "a serious blow to the prestige of Mrs. Gandhi's government," which has been in office for less than a month.

    According to a report in the *Indian Times* on the 16th, "An unprecedented chaos occurred in the People's Chamber on the 15th, with the debate on the food situation in Kerala reaching its peak." During the three-hour-long激动的 (激烈的) debate, opposition party members "demanded an immediate investigation into the alleged police excesses and food chaos in Kerala. The central government was bluntly accused of being indifferent and discriminatory towards the people of Kerala. Some opposition party members relentlessly attacked (Food Minister) Subramaniam, and most of the speeches were very emotional." "Speaker after speaker unanimously criticized the government for failing to provide rice to the famine-stricken Kerala in a timely manner." The report stated that although "Subramaniam bravely fought against the opposition's attacks, he was unable to complete his reply due to constant interruptions, jeers, and questions." "Despite repeated requests for calm and order from the Speaker, and despite a brief speech by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Subramaniam was not allowed to continue his speech, and he had to abruptly end his address."

    The Indian Press Trust reported: "The People's Chamber saw scenes of吵闹 (嘈杂), sometimes of吼叫 (叫嚷), for half an hour… Speaker Hukam Singh found it difficult to restrain the members, and with obvious embarrassment, he said that he could also leave the People's Chamber and let the members 'solve the problem themselves'."

    议会内一片吵嚷和混乱　会场外群众示威反饥饿
    印度政府被粮食危机弄得焦头烂额
    新华社十六日讯　新德里消息：印度政府在处理印度国内严重的粮食危机上的无能，在十四日开幕的印度议会人民院预算会议上，受到了反对党议员的强烈谴责，连有些国大党议员也同反对党一起抨击政府的粮食政策。与此同时，数千名印度人民在会场外面举行了反饥饿示威，抗议政府的粮食政策。
    西方通讯社在报道印度议会内吵吵嚷嚷一片混乱的情况时说，这对就职不到一个月的“甘地夫人的政府的威信是一个严重打击”。
    据《印度时报》十六日报道，“人民院十五日发生了一场空前的混乱，关于喀拉拉邦的粮食情况的辩论达到最高峰。”在持续三小时的激动的辩论过程中，反对党的议员们“要求立即对据说在喀拉拉邦发生的警察过火行动和粮食混乱状态进行调查。对中央毫不客气地进行了指责，说它对喀拉拉邦人民冷漠无情和歧视。有些反对党议员毫不容情地攻击（粮食部长）苏布拉马尼亚姆，绝大部分的发言是非常感情用事的。”“发言的人一个接着一个一致纷纷抨击政府没有及时向发生饥荒的喀拉拉邦提供大米。”报道说，尽管“苏布拉马尼亚姆对反对党的攻击孤力英勇奋战，但是由于时时有人插言、嘲笑和质问而无法把他的答复讲完。”“尽管议长一再要求保持安静和秩序，尽管总理英迪拉·甘地夫人作了简短的发言，但是还是没有让苏布拉马尼亚姆讲下去，他不得不突然结束了他的讲话。”
    印度报业托辣斯报道说：“人民院里在半小时的时间中出现了吵闹，有时是吼叫的场面……议长胡卡姆·辛格发现要制止议员是困难的，于是他带着明显的为难情绪说，他也可以离开人民院，让议员们‘自己来解决问题’”。
