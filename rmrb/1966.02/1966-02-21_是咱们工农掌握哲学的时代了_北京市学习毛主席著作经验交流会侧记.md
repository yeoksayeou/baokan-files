　　“It is the era of our workers and peasants mastering philosophy”
　　——A Side View of the Beijing Experience Exchange Conference on Studying Chairman Mao's Writings
    A mass movement to study Chairman Mao's writings is developing more and more widely and deeply in the capital. From the recently held Beijing Experience Exchange Conference on Studying Chairman Mao's Writings, people are particularly aware that the working class and peasantry have moved to the forefront of this movement. They learn from Chairman Mao's writings about stance, viewpoint, and method, and they use what they learn, with immediate results. In engaging in class struggle, they stand tall and firm, able to withstand any storm; in doing work, they produce cutting-edge products, in farming they grow more grain, in driving trains they haul more and run faster, and in doing business, they serve the people better. ... Countless vivid facts show that the working class and peasantry are not only the masters of the country but also the masters of theory and the masters of philosophy.
    Many ordinary workers and peasants have already announced with a wealth of vivid facts: philosophy has been liberated from the monopoly of a few and has become a sharp weapon in the hands of the broad masses of workers and peasants. The era of workers and peasants mastering philosophy has begun.
    To engage in revolution, it is not enough not to read Chairman Mao's books
    "Chairman Mao's books are our favorite to read."
    "To engage in revolution, it is not enough not to read Chairman Mao's books."
    These are words spoken from the bottom of the hearts of many workers, peasants, service personnel, salespersons, drivers, cooks, rural female commune members with limited literacy, and urban housewives. This is because Chairman Mao's books teach them to be wholeheartedly for the revolution, everything for the revolution, and wholeheartedly to serve the people, solving for them the fundamental problem of the proletarian world view.
    Song Wenmei, deputy director of the women's federation of the Beihaihutun Brigade of the Majuqiao Commune in Tong County, used to think only about "gathering enough firewood to burn, dividing enough grain to eat, and making enough shoe soles to spend." The commune members had elected her as women's team leader three times, but she refused to do it. In just over a year, she cast a vote for herself and, together with the masses, elected herself as deputy director of the women's federation, bravely taking on the responsibility of the women's federation work. Soon after, she gloriously joined the Communist Party and was recently elected as a member of the Beijing Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association Committee. What force caused her spiritual realm to undergo such a tremendous change in such a short period of time? Song Wenmei replied: "It is Chairman Mao's books."
    Two years ago, a cadre whom the commune members called "Female Eighth Route Army Soldier" said kindly to Song Wenmei: "Why don't you study Chairman Mao's writings?"
    "Chairman Mao's writings? I don't understand what 'writings' means."
    "It's the books written by Chairman Mao."
    "Books written by Chairman Mao, then I want to see them."
    In this way, the "Female Eighth Route Army Soldier" helped Song Wenmei begin to study Chairman Mao's writings. One day, she read "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to Song Wenmei. The more Song Wenmei listened, the more she felt that Chairman Mao's words were very cordial. She thought: Bethune was a Canadian who came all the way to China to help us with the revolution and dedicated his precious life. I am a daughter of a poor peasant, who was looked down upon in the old society. After liberation, the Party called on us to be masters of our own affairs, but I am unwilling to be a cadre, afraid of offending people, afraid of suffering losses, isn't this just like Chairman Mao criticized, "considering oneself first in everything"? The more she thought about it, the more she felt that Chairman Mao's words were criticizing her. She said secretly in her heart: "Chairman Mao, please don't talk about me anymore, I will listen to you. If I could write a letter, I would definitely write a guarantee to you, telling you that Song Wenmei wants to make revolution."
    From then on, if Song Wenmei didn't read Chairman Mao's books for a day, it was as if she hadn't eaten. She not only studied herself, but also helped her mother study, and helped women cadres and female commune members study. She told everyone about the stories of Bethune and Zhang Side in the cotton fields, and the reason that picking cotton is supporting the country's socialist construction and also engaging in revolution. The word "revolution" took root in her heart.
    Many workers and peasants, just like Song Wenmei, began to study Chairman Mao's writings with boundless love for Chairman Mao and with deep class feelings. They learn the principles of serving the people from Chairman Mao's writings. The more they study, the higher their class consciousness becomes, the more intense their class feelings become, the more they study, the more they love to study, and gradually, studying Chairman Mao's writings becomes their conscious instinct.
    Learn in Struggle, Use in Struggle
    The vivid examples of many activists in studying Chairman Mao's writings among workers and peasants show that philosophical theory is no longer something mysterious to them. They learn in struggle and use in struggle, grasping the viewpoint of "matter transforms into spirit, and spirit transforms into matter," and learning the "pulling the ox by the nose" (grasping the main contradiction) and "one divides into two." The more they learn, the smarter they become.
    Li Ruihuan, who has written many philosophical articles, learns for practice and uses it in practice. As a result, no matter what work he does, he can quickly "ride" the "horse" of objective laws. As a carpenter, he got rid of the old rule of "enlarging the sample" that carpenters had used for many years; as a plasterer, he summarized a complete set of working methods. The master worker said to him: "Your brain is really smart. You found the knack in a short time. I have been doing it for half my life and haven't found these methods." Li Ruihuan said: "It's not that my brain is smart, it's because Chairman Mao's books gave me guidance." In the past, he also admired the skillful people from the bottom of his heart, always thinking that people were born smart or had read many thick books. After reading Chairman Mao's books, he realized that people's correct ideas do not fall from the sky, nor are they inherent in the brain, but come from practice. In this way, he dared to think and dare to act, and he realized many philosophical principles in practice.
    Which comes first, the table or the design plan? After reading many long articles written by philosophers, it is still not clear which comes first. Once, someone took this question to ask Li Ruihuan, Li Ruihuan said: "Why do you insist on talking about the table? It is not easy to figure out the history of the table's creation. Let's talk about those things that are well-founded, visible, and tangible. Let's talk about our four-use folding bed! At first glance, it's both a table, a chair, a box, and a bed, and it's the first one that has never existed before! But if you ask me whether the design plan came first, or the four-use folding bed came first, I say the plan came first. Doesn't what I'm saying become idealism, with consciousness determining existence? No. My plan didn't fall from the sky, nor was it inherent in the brain, but was formulated based on the many objectively existing things such as the original tables, chairs, beds, boxes, etc., after processing by the brain." Isn't this the principle of matter transforming into spirit, and spirit transforming into matter?
    After Li Ruihuan introduced his vivid examples of learning and using philosophy at this experience exchange conference on studying Chairman Mao's writings, some people who specialize in philosophy said after listening: "The principles are very deep, the explanation is very lively, and it's enlightening to listen to."
    There are more than thousands of worker-peasant philosophers like Li Ruihuan in our country. Zhang Tilun, the party branch secretary of the Nanzhangdai Brigade of the Menlouzhuang Commune in Pinggu County, is another example.
    Zhang Tilun said: "Nanzhangdai started out with 'On Contradiction'." In the past, this brigade had low yields and relied on the state for food. Now, they farm for the revolution and use dialectics to farm, so that grain production has increased substantially and it has become a surplus grain team. Zhang Tilun always firmly grasps the main contradictions in his work and promotes the transformation of contradictions in a direction that is beneficial to the people. He believes that it is certain that you will harvest what you plant, but the amount of harvest depends greatly on human factors. As long as the enthusiasm of the people is fully mobilized, and they dare to make revolution and are good at mastering and applying objective laws, unfavorable conditions can be changed. In this way, he constantly grasps the main contradictions and leads the commune members to solve the main contradictions, so that people change their minds and increase production.
    Workers and Peasants Mastering Philosophy, Becoming Smarter and Freer
    By grasping the sharp weapon of materialist dialectics, the worker and peasant masses have not only become smarter, but also freer. The Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Bureau, which has persisted in studying Chairman Mao's writings for eight years, now has many workers who can consciously use materialist dialectics to guide revolutionary struggle practice. They have learned to "pull the ox by the nose" in the face of complex contradictions; when encountering difficulties, they understand that "it is difficult to move an inch with the word 'difficulty' at the head, and it is possible to travel thousands of miles with the word 'do' at the head;" in the process of overcoming difficulties, they pay attention to grasping the key, exploring the laws, and giving play to subjective initiative. They say: the road is made by people, things are done by people; in the face of new things, they know that they must "learn from doing, do from learning, and use doing to test understanding; it is good to learn to do;" when they achieve victory, they understand that they must "not be 'arrogant soldiers';" when old workers educate new workers, they understand that "strictness is love, leniency is harm, and sloppiness causes disaster." ... These figurative, dialectical languages have become common sayings in workers' lives. The more they learn, the deeper they get, the more they use it, the more alive it becomes, and they constantly fight hard battles in production, creating a record of safe driving for one million kilometers on the difficult Fengsha (Fengtai to Zhangjiakou) line, and continuously breaking the "saturation point" of hauling more and running faster on the Jingshan (Beijing to Shanhaiguan) line, creating many outstanding achievements in driving and repairing trains.
    When the worker and peasant masses grasp materialist dialectics and apply it to the three major revolutions, they constantly achieve one new achievement after another and climb one new peak after another. Ni Zhifu, the creator of the famous "Ni Zhifu drill," often encountered difficulties in the process of creating the first to the seventh types of drills. But last year, he created ten types of drills in only three months. In the past, drills could only drill holes in metal, but now drills can deal with some non-metallic materials. He felt that he was now more free with drills than he had been in the past. Last year, when he visited Daqing, the people of Daqing hoped that he would create a new drill for oil drilling rigs to drill holes into the earth. He said with confidence: "No matter how hard the earth is, we will drill into it with a drill, insert it into its heart, and let the underground oil flow out continuously."
    Be a Conscious Proletarian Revolutionary Fighter
    It can be seen from this meeting that many workers and peasants have become conscious proletarian revolutionary fighters through studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings in a living way. Although they are in factories, rural areas, and stores, they have the motherland in their hearts, have the world in their eyes, and can distinguish right from wrong, draw clear lines, and stand firm in the storms of class struggle. Li Fenglan, a 22-year-old female commune member of the Hongxing Commune in Daxing County, wholeheartedly made revolution and launched a complex and sharp struggle with class enemies and old forces. Although the masses were temporarily deceived and the leaders did not understand her, she withstood the storm, adhered to the truth, and persisted in the struggle with Mao Zedong Thought. At that moment, she read Chairman Mao's books day and night without letting go, found the weapons of struggle from Chairman Mao's books, drew infinite strength, and used Chairman Mao's books to educate the masses. Finally, with the support of the higher-level party organization, she won the victory of the struggle.
    When a major debate on right and wrong is taking place in the ideological field, many conscious workers and peasants also come forward and actively participate. They dare to launch struggles against fallacies such as "two combine into one" and have written many articles to expand the socialist ideological front. The workers of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Bureau alone have written more than 600 articles for newspapers and periodicals in recent years. Many of these articles are criticisms of the theory of "two combine into one" and films such as "Early Spring February".
    The worker and peasant masses, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have a fearless spirit. They dare to fight against the sky, against the earth, against US imperialism, against modern revisionism, and against all class enemies and old forces at home and abroad, and in any case, they are invincible.
    They said heroically: "It is the era of our workers and peasants mastering philosophy."

　　“是咱们工农掌握哲学的时代了”
　　——北京市学习毛主席著作经验交流会侧记
    一个学习毛主席著作的群众运动，正在首都越来越广泛、越来越深入地开展着。从最近举行的北京市学习毛主席著作经验交流会上，人们突出地感到，工农群众已走在这个运动的前面。他们从毛主席著作中学到立场、观点和方法，学了就用，立竿见影。搞阶级斗争，腰板挺得直，脚跟站得稳，再大的风浪都顶得住；做工的出尖端产品，种地的多打粮食，开火车的拉得多跑得快，做买卖的，为人民服务得更好。……无数生动的事实表明，工农群众不仅是国家的主人，也是理论的主人，哲学的主人。
    许多普普通通的工人、农民，已经用大量生动的事实宣告：哲学，已经从少数人的垄断下解放出来，成为广大工农群众手中的锐利武器，工农群众掌握哲学的时代开始了。
    干革命，不读毛主席的书不行
    “毛主席的书，咱们最爱读。”
    “干革命，不读毛主席的书不行。”
    这是许多工人、农民、服务员、售货员、驾驶员、炊事员，还有识字不多的农村女社员和城市家庭妇女，打心窝里说出来的话。这是因为，毛主席的书，教导着他们一心为革命，一切为革命，全心全意为人民服务，给他们解决了无产阶级世界观这个根本问题。
    通县马驹桥公社北海户屯大队妇联副主任宋文美，过去想的就是“拣的柴火够烧的，分点粮食够吃的，纳点鞋底够零花的。”社员们曾三次选她当妇女队长，她都不干。仅仅相隔一年多的时间，她却投了自己一票，同群众一起选自己当了妇联副主任，勇敢地挑起了妇联工作的担子。不久，她又光荣地参加了共产党，并在最近被选为北京市贫农下中农协会委员会委员。是什么力量使她的精神境界在这样短的时间里，发生了如此巨大的变化？宋文美回答说：“是毛主席的书”。
    两年前的一天，一位被社员们称为“女八路”的干部，亲切地对宋文美说：“你怎么不学习毛主席著作呀？”
    “毛主席著作？我不懂什么叫‘著作’。”
    “就是毛主席写的书。”
    “毛主席写的书，那我要看看。”
    就这样，那位“女八路”帮助宋文美学起毛主席著作来了。一天，她给宋文美念《纪念白求恩》，宋文美越听越觉得毛主席说的话挺亲切，心想：白求恩是加拿大人，那么老远来到中国帮助我们搞革命，献出了自己的宝贵生命。自己是个贫农的女儿，在旧社会被人看不起，解放后翻了身，党叫我们当家作主，可是我不愿当干部，怕得罪人，怕吃亏，不正象毛主席批评的那样“一事当前，先替自己打算”吗？她越想越觉得毛主席的话就是在批评自己。心里暗暗地说：“毛主席您不要再说我了，我听您的话了。我要是会写信，我一定给您老人家写一个保证书，告诉您，宋文美要革命。”
    从此，宋文美一天不读毛主席的书，就好象没有吃饭一样。她不光自己学，还帮助妈妈学，帮助妇女干部和女社员们学。她在棉花地里给大家讲白求恩、张思德的故事，讲拣棉花是支援国家社会主义建设、也是搞革命的道理。“革命”二字在她心里扎了根。
    许许多多的工农群众就是象宋文美一样，怀着对毛主席的无比热爱，带着深厚的阶级感情，开始学习毛主席著作的。他们从毛主席著作里学习为人民服务的道理，越学阶级觉悟越高，越学阶级感情越浓，越学越爱学，渐渐地，学习毛主席著作成了他们自觉的本能。
    在斗争中学，在斗争中用
    许多工农学习毛主席著作积极分子的生动事例说明，哲学理论对于他们已经不是什么神秘的东西。他们在斗争中学，在斗争中用，掌握住了“物质变精神，精神变物质”的观点，学会了“牵牛鼻子”（抓主要矛盾）和“一分为二”，越学越聪明了。
    写过许多哲学文章的李瑞环，为实践而学，又在实践中用，结果他不论做什么工作，都能很快就“骑”上客观规律的“马”。当木工，他革掉了木工多年“放大样”的老规矩；当抹灰工，他总结出了一整套工作方法。老师傅对他说：“你脑袋瓜儿真灵，时间不长就找到了门道，我干了半辈子，没有找出这些办法来”。李瑞环说：“不是我脑瓜儿灵，是因为毛主席的书给我作了指导”。过去他对心灵手巧的人，也是打心眼里羡慕，总觉得人家是天生的聪明，或者读过很多厚本书。读了毛主席的书，才认识到人的正确思想不是从天上掉下来的，也不是脑子里固有的，而是从实践中来的。这样，他才敢想敢干，在实践中悟出了许多哲学道理。
    先有桌子还是先有设计方案？读了许多哲学家写的长篇文章，还是闹不清楚先有什么。一次，有人拿这个问题去问李瑞环，李瑞环说：“你干吗偏说桌子，产生桌子的历史不易闹清楚。你说说那些有根有据，看得见摸得着的。就说我们这个四用折叠床吧！你一看又是桌子，又是椅子，又是箱子，又是床，也是过去没有过的第一个吧！可你要问我，是先有设计方案，还是先有四用折叠床，我说是先有方案。我这样说不是成了意识决定存在，变成唯心主义了吗？不是。我的方案并不是从天上掉下来的，也不是脑子里固有的，而是根据原来的桌子、椅子、床、箱子等等许多客观存在的实际东西，经过脑子的加工制定出来的”。这不就是物质变精神，精神变物质的道理吗？
    李瑞环在这次学习毛主席著作经验交流会上介绍了他学哲学、用哲学的生动事例之后，有些专门研究哲学的人听了都说：“道理很深，讲得很活，听了开窍”。
    象李瑞环这样的工农哲学家，在我们的国家何止万千。平谷县门楼庄公社南张岱大队党支部书记张体伦就是又一个例子。
    张体伦说：“南张岱是靠《矛盾论》起家的”。过去这个大队产量低，吃饭靠国家，现在，他们为革命种田，用辩证法种田，使粮食生产大幅度增长，变成了余粮队。张体伦做工作总是紧紧抓住主要矛盾，促使矛盾向有利于人民的方向转化。他认为种庄稼种什么收什么这是一定的，可是收多收少，人的因素就起很大作用。只要充分调动起人的积极性，敢于革命，善于掌握和运用客观规律，就能改变不利条件。他就是这样，不断抓住主要矛盾，带领着社员们去解决主要矛盾，使人变思想地增产。
    工农掌握哲学，聪明了，自由了
    工农群众掌握了唯物辩证法这个锐利的武器，不但聪明了，也变得自由了。坚持学习毛主席著作八年的北京铁路局丰台机务段，现在许多职工都能自觉地运用唯物辩证法来指导革命斗争实践。他们学会了在复杂的矛盾面前“牵牛鼻子”；遇到困难的时候，懂得“难字当头，寸步难行，干字当头，日行千里”；在战胜困难的斗争过程中，注意抓关键，摸规律，发挥主观能动性。他们说：路在人走，事在人为；在新事物面前，知道要“干中学，学中干，干把认识来检验，能学会干是好汉”；在取得胜利的时候，懂得“不当‘骄兵’”；老工人在教育新工人的时候，懂得“严是爱，松是害，松松垮垮遭祸害。”……这些形象化、充满辩证法的语言，已经成为工人生活中的口头语。他们越学越深、越用越活，在生产上不断打硬仗，在艰险的丰沙（丰台至张家口的一段）线上创造了安全行车百万公里的纪录，在京山（北京至山海关）线上连续打破多拉快跑的“饱和点”，在开火车和修火车方面创造了许多优异成绩。
    工农群众掌握了唯物辩证法，并且把它运用到三大革命中去，就不断取得一个又一个新成就，攀登上一个又一个新高峰。著名的“倪志福钻头”的创造者倪志福，在创造第一种到第七种钻头的过程中，经常要碰钉子。而在去年，他只用三个月就创造了十种钻头。过去的钻头，只能在金属上打孔，现在的钻头能对付一些非金属材料。他感到对钻头，现在比过去就比较自由了。去年他去大庆参观时，大庆人希望他创造一种石油钻机的新钻头，向地球打孔，他满怀信心地说：“地球再硬，我们也要用钻头钻下去，插进它的心脏，让地下的石油源源不断地流出来”。
    做自觉的无产阶级革命战士
    从这个会上看出，许多工农群众通过活学活用毛主席著作，成为自觉的无产阶级革命战士。他们身在工厂、农村、商店，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，在阶级斗争的风浪里能分清是非，划清界限，站稳立场。二十二岁的大兴县红星公社女社员李凤兰，一个心眼为革命，同阶级敌人和旧势力展开了一场复杂尖锐的斗争。虽然一时群众受蒙蔽，领导对她不了解，但她凭着毛泽东思想，顶住了风浪，坚持真理，坚持斗争。在那样的时刻，她一天天、一夜夜地读着毛主席的书不放手，从毛主席的书里找到了斗争的武器，汲取了无穷的力量，并且用毛主席的书去教育群众，终于在上级党组织的支持下，获得了斗争的胜利。
    当意识形态领域里进行大是大非的辩论的时候，许多有觉悟的工人、农民，也挺身而出，积极参加。他们敢于同“合二而一”等谬论展开斗争，写出了许多文章来扩大社会主义思想阵地。仅北京铁路局丰台机务段职工几年来就给报刊写过六百多篇文章，许多文章是批判“合二而一”论和《早春二月》等影片的。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农群众，有着大无畏的气概。他们敢于同天斗，同地斗，同美帝国主义斗，同现代修正主义斗，同国内外一切阶级敌人和旧势力斗，并且在任何情况下，都立于不败之地。
    他们豪迈地说：“是咱们工农掌握哲学的时代了。”
