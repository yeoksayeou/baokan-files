    I finished watching "100 Points Isn't a Perfect Score" performed by the China Children's Art Theatre with excitement. The script is well-written, and the performance is excellent. This play is full of revolutionary passion. Although short, it has profound implications. Children are educated by it, and we educators are also stimulated to think deeply. We thank the comrades of the China Children's Art Theatre for staging this good play, and we hope that instructors will also read this script.

    We educators bear the task of cultivating revolutionary successors, and we all want to cultivate the new generation into revolutionary successors who meet the needs of the revolutionary cause and can continuously push our great revolutionary cause forward. How can we realize this wish? This play, through the image of the teenager Dazhi, tells us that first, we must arm the new generation with Mao Zedong Thought, broaden their minds, make them cherish the motherland, have the world in mind, have a strong sense of responsibility for the revolution, and study hard for the revolution and for the struggle. With this, they will regard learning as a revolutionary burden entrusted to them by the Party and revolutionary elders, strictly demand themselves, overcome various difficulties in learning with tenacious perseverance, and treat every subject and every problem with a down-to-earth attitude.

    Dazhi in this play is such a new Chinese teenager nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. While in the classroom, he has a world map in his heart. He can hear the sound of shackles in Taiwan prisons, the cries of children in South Vietnamese concentration camps, the sound of whips on the people of Congo, and the machine guns of the Americans massacring the people of Panama. He thought of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. It is precisely for the revolution that he is always so motivated to learn, always learns so well, and always demands so much of himself.

    Xiaoyi is different. She lacks the ambition to study for the revolution, and all she thinks about is scores. She studies hard and memorizes carefully for subjects that have exams, and throws aside courses like animals that are not tested. When her father asked her, she said triumphantly, "Don't you know! Animals, history, and physics are all learned lightly because they aren't tested!" Obviously, how can someone like Xiaoyi master all the knowledge and skills needed for the revolutionary and construction cause!

    These two characters vividly illustrate that politics is the commander, the soul, and ideological and political education must be placed at the top of all work. To cultivate teenagers and children into revolutionary successors, and to enable them to master the knowledge and skills of revolution and construction, we cannot simply impart knowledge, but must effectively strengthen ideological education. Starting from ideological and political education, some people say that ideological and political education is empty talk and does not solve the problem of learning. The error of this view should be obvious in front of these two typical figures.

    With revolutionary thought as motivation, there must also be correct learning methods. In this play, Dazhi represents one learning method, and Xiaoyi represents another. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, Dazhi studies vividly, actively, and proactively. He carefully studies the revolutionary principles taught in class and in books, integrates them, turns them into his own thoughts, and guides his actions. As for the scientific knowledge taught in books, he thinks of its use in building the motherland, listens carefully, and also experiments himself to explore the truth. In this way, he truly learns revolutionary thought and truly learns useful knowledge. Xiaoyi is different. She recites revolutionary principles as dogmas, remembers them very clearly, and recites them fluently, but cannot truly understand them. Regarding scientific knowledge, she also knows only what it is, but not why it is, only remembering conclusions, but not knowing how the conclusions were reached. Although her exam scores are very high, what she learns is only dead knowledge. We can imagine, if things continue like this, how can she withstand the test of the storms of class struggle when she grows up, and how can she shoulder the arduous and complex task of construction!

    The detour that Xiaoyi takes in her studies makes us clearly see the harm of advocating books, despising practice, studying mechanically, and simply pursuing scores. However, in the teacher's mind, Xiaoyi is a good student with excellent academic performance. The responsibility for Xiaoyi's shortcomings does not lie with her alone, but is mainly caused by the teacher's erroneous educational ideas (the script does not write enough in this regard). In our school education work, there are not a few people who teach students and demand students like this. After watching this play, I deeply feel that we really need to think carefully about how we should cultivate the revolutionary new generation. We really need to study Chairman Mao's educational thought carefully, understand Chairman Mao's instruction on cultivating children in all aspects of morality, intelligence, and physique to develop vividly, actively, and proactively, be determined to clean up our old educational ideas, effectively improve educational work, and truly, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, cultivate and educate the revolutionary new generation well.

    应该怎样教育革命的新一代
    ——话剧《一百分不算满分》观后
    仲少文
    我满怀着激动的心情，看完了中国儿童艺术剧院演出的《100分不算满分》。剧本写得好，演得也好。这出戏，充满了革命激情，戏虽然短小，却寓意深刻，孩子们看了受到教育，我们教育工作者看了也发人深思。我们感谢中国儿童艺术剧院的同志上演这出好戏，希望辅导员同志们也来读一读这个剧本。
    我们教育工作者，担负着培养革命接班人的任务，都想把新的一代培养成为符合革命事业需要的、能把我们伟大的革命事业不断推向前进的革命接班人。怎样把这个愿望付诸实现呢？这出戏，通过大志这个少年的形象告诉我们，首先要用毛泽东思想武装新的一代，使他们胸襟开阔，心怀祖国，放眼世界，对革命有强烈的责任感，为了革命、为了斗争去发愤学习。有了这一点，他们就会把学习看作党和革命长辈交给自己的革命担子，就会严格地要求自己，用顽强的毅力去克服学习上的各种困难，用踏踏实实的态度去对待每一门功课、每一道习题。
    这出戏里的大志，就是这样一个在毛泽东思想哺育下的新中国少年，他身在课堂，心里却有一张世界大地图。他听得见台湾监狱里的镣铐声，南越集中营里孩子们的啼哭声，抽在刚果人民身上的鞭子声，美国佬屠杀巴拿马人民的机枪声。他想到了中国革命和世界革命，他正是为了革命，所以学习的劲头总是那么足，学得总是那么好，对自己要求总是那样严。
    小宜却不一样，她缺乏为革命学习的志向，心里想的就是分数。凡是要考试的科目，她就用心学，用心记，不考的如动物之类的课程就扔在一边。当父亲问她的时候，她还得意地说：“您还不知道呀！动物、历史、物理都是光学不考！”很显然，象小宜这样，怎么能去掌握革命和建设事业所需要的一切知识和本领呢！
    这两个人物生动地说明，政治是统帅，是灵魂，思想政治教育工作必须摆在一切工作的首位。要把少年儿童培养成为革命接班人，要使他们掌握革命和建设的知识和本领，不能单纯传授知识，而必须切实加强思想教育。从思想政治教育入手，有的人说思想政治教育是空道理，不解决学习问题，这种看法的错误，在这两个典型人物面前，应该是显而易见的了。
    有了革命思想作动力，还要有正确的学习方法。在这出戏里，大志是一种学习方法，小宜又是一种学习方法。大志按照毛主席的教导，生动活泼地主动地学习，课堂上书本上讲的革命道理，他用心琢磨，融会贯通，变成自己的思想，指导自己的行动。书本上讲的科学知识，他想到在建设祖国中的用处，用心听讲，还亲自试验，探索究竟。这样，他就真正学到了革命的思想，真正学到了有用的知识。小宜就不同了，他把革命道理当作教条背诵，记得很清楚，背得很流利，却不能真正理解。他对科学知识，也是知其然不知其所以然，只记结论，却不知道结论是怎么得出来的。虽然考试分数很高，学的却只是一些死知识。我们可以设想，象这样下去，长大了怎么能够经受得起阶级斗争风浪的考验，又怎能承担起艰巨复杂的建设重担呢！
    小宜在学习上走的一段弯路，使我们清楚地看到崇尚书本，轻视实际，呆读死记，单纯追求分数的害处。而小宜在老师心目中，却是一个学习成绩优良的好学生。小宜有这样的缺点，责任并不在她自己，主要是教师错误的教育思想造成的（剧本在这方面写得很不够）。在我们的学校教育工作中，象这样教学生，要求学生的人，并不在少数。看了这出戏，深深感到，我们实在需要好好想一想，到底应该怎样培养革命的新一代。实在需要好好地学习毛主席的教育思想，领会毛主席关于培养少年儿童在德智体诸方面生动活泼地主动地得到发展的指示，下决心清理自己旧的教育思想，切实改进教育工作，真正按照毛主席的教导，培养教育好革命的新一代。〔原载《辅导员》杂志〕
