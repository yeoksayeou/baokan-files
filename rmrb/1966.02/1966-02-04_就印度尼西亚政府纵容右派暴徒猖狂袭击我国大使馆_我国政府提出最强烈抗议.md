    Our Government Lodges Strongest Protest Against the Indonesian Government's Connivance with Right-Wing Thugs to Rampantly Attack Our Embassy
    Our Foreign Ministry Note Solemnly Points Out: This is a Great Insult and Extremely Serious Provocation by the Indonesian Right-Wing Forces Against Our Country and Our People, and the Indonesian Government Bears an Unshirkable Grave Responsibility
    Xinhua News Agency, 4th. This morning, our Vice Foreign Minister Han Nianlong handed a note to Indonesian Ambassador to China, Djawoto, lodging the strongest protest with the Indonesian government regarding the extremely serious incident of the barbaric attack on the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia by thugs organized by Indonesian right-wing forces. The full text of the note is as follows:

To the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia:

    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China extends its compliments to the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia and makes the following statements regarding the extremely serious incident of the attack on the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia by thugs organized by Indonesian right-wing forces:

    At 13:10 (Jakarta time) on February 3, 1966, a group of over 1,000 thugs calling themselves the "United Action Command of Indonesian University Students" arrived in front of the Chinese Embassy in trucks, armored vehicles, and motorcycles, and launched a rampant attack on the Embassy. They openly smashed the Chinese national emblem hanging on the Embassy gate and stole the copper plaque with the inscription "Embassy of the People's Republic of China". Groups of thugs also climbed onto the walls of the Embassy, shouting abuse and throwing stones violently into the Embassy, causing serious damage to the Embassy and injuring one of the Embassy staff. While attacking the Embassy, they also shouted all kinds of vicious anti-China slogans, smeared anti-China slogans on the Embassy walls, and slandered China. They shouted things like "Smash the People's Republic of China", "Drive out the People's Republic of China", "Hang the Chinks", "Beijing Chinks go home," etc., and even used extremely vulgar language to insult Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people.

    The attack on the Chinese Embassy by these thugs lasted for one hour and twenty minutes. When the thugs were committing the crime, dozens of Indonesian military police officers who were present not only stood by and did not stop them, but some even waved to the thugs to encourage them. During this period, the Chinese Embassy repeatedly telephoned the relevant departments such as the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Police, and the Mobile Police Command, requesting them to take effective measures immediately to protect the safety of the Embassy. However, they never took any positive action. The above facts show that this outrage by the Indonesian right-wing forces was obviously a planned and organized premeditated act, and it occurred with the connivance of the Indonesian government. The Indonesian government bears an unshirkable serious responsibility for this atrocity.

    The barbaric attack on the Chinese Embassy by thugs organized by the Indonesian right-wing forces is a serious violation of diplomatic privileges, a blatant violation of the norms of international relations, a great insult and extremely serious provocation to the People's Republic of China and the entire Chinese people, and yet another serious step by the Indonesian right-wing forces to continuously undermine the relations between the two countries. The Chinese government and the Chinese people express their great indignation at this. The Chinese government lodges the strongest protest with the Indonesian government for this.

    The Chinese government demands that the Indonesian government immediately issue a public apology for this incident, immediately punish the perpetrators and their instigators, immediately be responsible for returning the stolen copper plaque of the Chinese Embassy, and earnestly guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again. The Chinese government reserves the right to further make representations and demand compensation for all losses. Please reply to the above requests immediately.

    With the highest respect.

    Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
    February 3, 1966, in Beijing

    就印度尼西亚政府纵容右派暴徒猖狂袭击我国大使馆
    我国政府提出最强烈抗议
    我外交部照会严正指出：这是印度尼西亚右派势力对我国和我国人民的极大侮辱和极其严重的挑衅，印度尼西亚政府负有不容推卸的严重责任
    新华社四日讯　我国外交部副部长韩念龙今天清晨把一份照会交给印度尼西亚驻华大使查禾多，就印度尼西亚右派势力组织的暴徒野蛮袭击中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的极端严重事件，向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。照会全文如下：印度尼西亚驻华大使馆：
    中华人民共和国外交部向印度尼西亚共和国驻华大使馆致意，并就印度尼西亚右派势力组织的暴徒袭击中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的极端严重事件，申述如下：
    一九六六年二月三日十三时十分（雅加达时间），一批自称为“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动指挥部”的暴徒约千余人，分乘卡车、装甲车、摩托车到中国大使馆门前，对大使馆进行猖狂的袭击。他们公然打碎了悬挂在大使馆大门上的中国国徽，劫走了刻有“中华人民共和国大使馆”标志的铜牌。成群的暴徒还爬上大使馆的墙头，大肆叫骂，向大使馆内猛烈投掷石块，使大使馆受到了严重破坏，并且打伤了大使馆的一名工作人员。他们在袭击大使馆的同时，还狂呼种种恶毒的反华口号，并且在大使馆墙上涂写反华标语，对中国进行诽谤。他们叫喊什么“粉碎中华人民共和国”、“赶走中华人民共和国”、“吊死支那人”、“北京支那滚回老家去”，等等，甚至用极其粗野的言词侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席。
    这批暴徒对中国大使馆的袭击，历时达一小时二十分钟。暴徒行凶时，数十名在场的印度尼西亚军警非但袖手旁观，不加制止，而且还有人对暴徒挥手示意，加以鼓动。在此期间，中国大使馆曾先后数次电话通知印度尼西亚外交部、警察部和机动警察司令部等有关部门，要求他们立即采取有效措施，保护大使馆的安全，但是，他们始终没有采取积极行动。上述种种事实表明，印度尼西亚右派势力这次暴行，显然是一次有计划、有组织的预谋行为，并且是在印度尼西亚政府纵容之下发生的。印度尼西亚政府对于这一暴行负有不容推卸的严重责任。
    印度尼西亚右派势力组织的暴徒对中国大使馆的野蛮袭击，是对外交特权的严重侵犯，是对国际关系准则的粗暴破坏，是对中华人民共和国和全体中国人民的极大侮辱和极其严重的挑衅，也是印度尼西亚右派势力不断破坏两国关系的又一严重步骤。中国政府和中国人民对此表示极大的愤慨。中国政府为此向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    中国政府要求印度尼西亚政府对这一事件，立即公开道歉，立即惩办肇事者及其主使人，立即负责送还被劫走的中国大使馆铜牌，并且切实保证不再发生类似事件。中国政府保留进一步提出交涉和要求赔偿一切损失的权利。以上要求，请印度尼西亚政府立即给予答复。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
              中华人民共和国外交部
                  一九六六年二月三日于北京
