    Dead "Checks" vs. Active Help
    Inspector Zhang Qiantang
    The quality inspection system is an important checkpoint for ensuring product quality. Quality inspectors are the gatekeepers of this checkpoint. However, to conscientiously fulfill one's duty in guarding this gate, one cannot simply "check" rigidly. Instead, one must discover problems through these checks, help solve them, and ensure that products smoothly pass through the gate. This is the responsibility of the gatekeeper. My understanding of this has gone through a tortuous process.
    At first, I thought that since the inspector was the gatekeeper, then I had to "check" harshly, not letting any defective products slip through. This was my only responsibility. As for how to help operators improve product quality, it had nothing to do with me. As a result, I ran into many obstacles.
    For example, I once had a quarrel with Li Kuixiang from the trimming group. His product quality was poor, and I didn't allow him to produce, which was right. But I didn't patiently explain the principles of ensuring quality to him, nor did I help him think of improvement measures. Instead, I simply and rudely said, "You can't do it this way! You can't produce!" He was very dissatisfied with me. A few days later, he produced some more defective products. And for two consecutive months, product quality was very poor. Not only did the planned targets not improve, but they decreased.
    Why couldn't my harsh "checks" solve the problem? What should I do in the future? With these questions, I studied "On Contradiction." Chairman Mao said, "Materialist dialectics holds that external causes are the condition of change, internal causes are the basis of change, and external causes act through internal causes." Chairman Mao's words made me realize that simply "checking" is not enough, and I must work hard on "helping."
    How to help? As the saying goes: to water flowers, water the roots; to help people, help their hearts. After several patient conversations with Li Kuixiang, I learned that his product quality was poor not because of his low technical level, nor because the machine tool was bad, but because he ideologically didn't put quality first. He believed that as long as the output was high, it didn't matter if the quality was a little worse. In response to this idea, I explained to him the dialectical relationship between quality and quantity, and the importance of quality first.
    After his thinking was improved, I helped him improve technical measures. As a result, the qualified rate of quality increased by about 40% compared to the past. With the good word "quality" at the forefront, and the thought of quality first, the product quality for several consecutive months exceeded the planned targets.
    Through this incident, I deeply realized that I must handle the relationship between "checking" and "helping" well. The purpose of "checking" is to discover contradictions and expose contradictions. The purpose of "helping" is to better resolve contradictions. Only "checking" without helping cannot resolve contradictions. In the process of checking quality, both helping and "checking" can truly resolve contradictions and ensure product quality.

    死“卡”与活帮
    检验员　张钱堂
    质量检查制度，是保证产品质量的重要关口。质量检查员就是这个关口的把关人。但是要想尽职尽责的把好关，却不能死把关。而是要通过把关，发现问题，帮助解决问题，使产品顺利的通过关口，这才是把关人的责任。在这方面，我的认识是有过曲折的。
    开始，我认为，既然检查员是把关的，那就要狠狠的“卡”住，不让废次品溜过去，就是我唯一的职责。至于如何帮助操作者把产品质量提高，与己无关。结果碰了不少钉子。
    比如，有一次我和切边组李奎祥发生了口角。他的产品质量不好，我不准许他生产，这是应该的。但是我没有耐心的把保证质量的道理跟他讲清楚，也没帮他想想改进措施，而只是简单粗暴地说，“你这样干不行！不能生产！”他对我很不满意。不几天他又出了些次品。并且接连两个月产品质量都很差。计划指标不但没提高，反而降低了。
    为什么我“卡”的这么狠，还不能解决问题呢？以后我该怎么办呢？我带着问题，学习《矛盾论》。毛主席说：“唯物辩证法认为外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用。”毛主席的这段话，使我认识到：只“卡”不行，还得从“帮”上下功夫。
    怎么帮呢？俗话说：浇花要浇根，帮人要帮心。经过几次和李奎祥耐心的谈话，才知道他的产品质量不好，不是因为他的技术水平低，也不是机床不好，而是他思想上没把质量放在第一位。他认为，只要产量多，质量差点不要紧。针对他这种思想，我和他讲明了质与量的辩证关系，和质量第一的重要意义。
    他的思想提高了，我又帮他改进技术措施，结果质量合格率比过去提高了百分之四十左右。有了好字当头，质量第一的思想，连续几个月的产品质量都超过了计划指标。
    通过这件事，使我深深的认识到：必须处理好“卡”与帮的关系。“卡”的目的就是要发现矛盾，揭露矛盾。帮的目的就是要更好的解决矛盾。只“卡”不帮，是不能解决矛盾的。在检查质量的过程中，既帮又“卡”，才能真正解决矛盾，保证产品质量。
