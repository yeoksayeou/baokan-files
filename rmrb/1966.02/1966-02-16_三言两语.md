    A Few Words
    All Shots Miss
    An official of the U.S. Department of Defense told reporters that the U.S. aggressor troops in the South Vietnam battlefield fired bullets at an annual rate of one billion, averaging four thousand bullets fired for each soldier of the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces.
    The Pentagon released this "astonishing number" to boast about the ample supply of U.S. ammunition. In fact, it shows that the U.S. invading forces in Vietnam have low morale, are incompetent in combat, and all shots miss.
    So That's Why
    Responsible officials of the Indian government desperately promoted the "Tashkent Declaration" concocted by the new Soviet leaders at the National Congress Party's annual meeting, while shouting loudly that "India insists that Kashmir is a part of India over which it has sovereign rights." In this way, they made it clear that, from the perspective of the Indian reactionaries, the "Tashkent Declaration" is a deed recognizing India's continued occupation of Kashmir. No wonder the leaders of the National Congress Party gratefully expressed "sincere thanks to the Soviet Premier."

    三言两语
    弹皆虚发
    美国国防部官员对记者说，美国侵略军在南越战场上发射的子弹达到年率十亿发，对每一个南越人民武装力量的战士平均发射四千发子弹。
    五角大楼发表这个“惊人数字”，是要炫耀美国弹药充足的，事实上它却表明，侵越美军士气低落作战无能弹皆虚发。
    原来如此
    印度政府负责官员在国大党年会上拼命宣扬苏联新领导一手炮制的“塔什干宣言”，同时大叫大嚷“印度坚持克什米尔是印度拥有主权的一部分的立场”。这样，他们就最清楚不过地说出了：从印度反动派看来，“塔什干宣言”是承认印度继续霸占克什米尔的契据。这就难怪国大党领导人心满意足地对“苏联总理表示衷心的感谢”了。
