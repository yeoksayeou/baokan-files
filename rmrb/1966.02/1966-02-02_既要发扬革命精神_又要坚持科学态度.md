    "What is work? Work is struggle." The mass water and soil basic construction movement in Xijiang County last winter more profoundly proved that Chairman Mao's instruction is an irrefutable truth. In order to respond to the call of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China "Resolution on Mobilizing All People, Fighting for Five Years, and Building Two 15 Million Mu of Stable and High-Yield Farmland," the party organizations at all levels in the county, leading the broad masses of cadres and the masses, earnestly summarized historical experience, extensively conducted investigation and research, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai people who dared to think, dare to do, and change the world, and quickly launched a large-scale agricultural basic construction movement centered on water and soil. In just two months, great achievements were made. The county newly dug 108 wells, expanded and built 13 electromechanical irrigation stations, dug 11 spring interceptions, newly opened 393 channels, expanded the watered land by 18,047 mu, treated 600 mu of alkali land; renovated 60,838 mu of land, including 21,334 mu of Dazhai fields.

    Such a large-scale mass movement to transform nature can develop healthily. In addition to doing a good job in ideological and organizational work, the most important thing is to strive to study Chairman Mao's works, consciously use Mao Zedong Thought, summarize historical experience, strengthen investigation and research, often grasp the living thoughts, and effectively handle the relationship in four aspects.

    The relationship between the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and daring to do and the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts.

    To control water and soil and change the face of nature, we must first realize the ideological revolutionization of people and change their mental state. To make people have lofty revolutionary ideals, firm revolutionary will, the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, and the revolutionary working style of acting swiftly and decisively. Only in this way can we not be afraid of ghosts, not believe in evil, liberate our minds, break superstitions, create boldly, and overcome all difficulties. These principles seem ordinary to say, and everyone understands them, but the reality is not so. Although our agriculture has been collectivized for many years, the thinking of many comrades is not fully adapted to the requirements of socialist large-scale agriculture. When they think about problems, do things, and do work, they are always small and tied down, unable to break through the circle of small-scale peasant economy. They only consider the interests of their own commune, their own team, and their own unit, and do not consider the interests of the entire county, the entire province, the entire country, or even the whole world. They cannot link their own interests, the interests of their own commune and team, with the interests of the entire revolutionary cause. For example, when we mobilized cadres and the masses to carry out large-scale water and soil construction, some comrades from advanced communes and teams reflected thoughts of arrogance, complacency, conservatism, contentment with the status quo, and unwillingness to make progress, saying, "Production is almost there, it has reached the top"; conversely, some comrades from backward communes and teams had pessimistic views, did nothing, and were willing to be slaves to nature, saying, "Our conditions are poor, and no matter how hard we work, we can't go up." These arguments are like "golden hoops," tightly binding their own thoughts. This shows that some of our comrades do not yet understand Chairman Mao's teachings: "The changing movement of the objective real world never ends, and people's understanding of truth in practice never ends." "Of all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle can be created." Faced with this fact, the county party committee, on the basis of mobilizing the masses, organized relevant county-level cadres to observe and learn in advanced areas. While watching and discussing, looking at others, comparing ourselves, finding gaps, discussing the real and the virtual, repeatedly comparing, and repeatedly discussing, in this way, from material to spirit, and then from spirit to material, everyone was educated and improved their understanding. It was clarified that daring or not daring to fight against heaven and earth is a major issue of daring or not daring to make revolution and whether or not to make revolution, and that to make revolution, one must have lofty ambitions and a revolutionary spirit. Thus, it boosted revolutionary enthusiasm, overcame various difficulties, and set off a surge of large-scale water and soil basic construction.

    Practice has proved that it is not enough to have lofty ambitions and revolutionary enthusiasm. One must also have a scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts. Because production revolution is like fighting a war, it must have strategic goals and tactical plans, and must never shout slogans emptily. That is to say, the large-scale water and soil basic construction movement must not only have plans, but the plans must be reliable. To achieve this, we must respect science, respect objective laws, and combine the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and daring to do with the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts. Objective things are very complicated, and objective laws do not shift according to man's will. Only by seeing the internal connections through the superficial phenomena of things, grasping its laws of development, adapting to local conditions, and seeking truth from facts, can we achieve our wishes. The leader's task is to grasp the timing and be a sober revolutionary promoter. In the early stage of the movement, after a series of work, when the revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast majority of cadres rose, some comrades were not calm enough and wanted to do things that could only be done tomorrow today. Some advocated: "Simply stop all work and specialize in water and soil construction." Obviously, this is unrealistic. If this phenomenon is allowed to develop, it will inevitably embark on the path of subjective idealism, and finally form separation from reality and separation from the masses. As early as the preface to the book "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," Chairman Mao pointed out: "No one can daydream without basis, no one can plan their actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, and do not reluctantly do things that are really impossible to do." According to this instruction, the county party committee promptly helped everyone realize that the spirit of daring to think and daring to do is good, it can break through superstition and conservatism, but it must not violate science, violate objective laws, and must not work "daydreaming without basis." Otherwise, if we do not proceed from reality, do as we please, and regard fantasy as truth, then it becomes subjective idealism. Objective laws are merciless, and whoever "plays tricks" in front of it will be punished by history. And on this basis, combined with the specific situation, after repeated discussions, the plan was revised and implemented. This effectively guaranteed the healthy development of the movement.

    The relationship between carrying forward the communist style and implementing the socialist policies of distribution according to work, voluntary mutual benefit, and equivalent exchange.

    In the agricultural basic construction movement centered on water and soil control, a considerable number of projects and activities require several brigades, even several communes, or several counties to act in a unified manner and fight together to complete. For example, the entire land on Emei Ridge in Fen South and Lu Liang Mountain in Fen North, as well as the development of the Longwang Spring Trunk Canal under the Gu Dui Mountain, cannot be done by the strength of a certain brigade or even a certain commune in these areas. Therefore, it is necessary to carry forward the communist spirit and style and carry out necessary production collaboration. However, when carrying out specific work, we must pay attention to drawing a clear line between carrying forward the communist style and implementing the party's policies. We must strictly adhere to the principles of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange to ensure the smooth implementation of the socialist policy of distribution according to work. Only by meticulously handling affairs in accordance with the party's policies can we better protect and carry forward the communist spirit and style, and can we fully mobilize and give play to the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. However, some comrades do not yet understand this principle very well. When they hear about collaboration, they shake their heads and wave their hands, fearing to repeat the mistakes of the past. This mental state is actually "drawing a circle and imprisoning oneself." There are also some people whose brains are overheated, forgetting the party's policies, saying, "Why talk about you and me in communist collaboration." This is actually a lack of correct understanding of ideals and reality, and treating the future as the present. We paid attention to solving these problems in the bud stage. Therefore, the development of the movement has always been healthy.

    The relationship between long-term construction and current production.

    Long-term construction is the fundamental plan for developing socialist agricultural production. Without long-term construction, agricultural production cannot be developed, and even maintaining the status quo cannot be maintained. Only caring about the present, not the long-term, only caring about today, not tomorrow, short-sightedness, and inaction are the ideological reflections of the small-scale peasant economy. To lead socialist large-scale agriculture well, we must stand high and see far, see both the present and the long-term, and establish a firm long-term construction thinking. This is the demeanor and spirit that our communists should have. But on the other hand, we cannot ignore the current production. Because current production is an inseparable part of long-term construction. Only by grasping the current production can long-term construction be based on a reliable foundation. This is also the materialist dialectical view that our communists should have. Therefore, at the beginning of the large-scale water and soil basic construction movement, the county party committee considered the issues of reasonable arrangement and overall planning, and reminded the leading comrades of party organizations at all levels that they must have an overall view in all aspects of guiding ideology, organizational arrangement, and specific work; put forward the action slogan of "promoting current production with long-term construction and ensuring long-term construction with current production"; and repeatedly emphasized that in the arrangement of projects, we should pay attention to practical results, ensure increased production, and carry out more small-scale projects with less money, more benefits, and faster speeds, and strive to make one place, one place, and use one place in winter irrigation and spring irrigation of wheat and cotton autumn fields. Despite this, the phenomenon of insufficient attention to current production still appeared in some places. Some places even concentrated more than 60% of the full and semi-labor force on water and soil basic construction, putting aside the current production such as wheat field management (especially winter irrigation), autumn plowing, fertilizer accumulation and delivery, afforestation, and diversified operations. This inevitably caused serious impact on current production. Discovering this situation, the county party committee immediately held a meeting to guide everyone to comprehensively and deeply review and summarize the previous work, further clear everyone's minds, and at the same time, organized everyone to study and visit 18 brigades in the county that had handled the relationship between long-term construction and current production well. From these typical visits, everyone saw the causal relationship of mutual restriction, mutual connection, and mutual influence of things, so that everyone realized that any practice that only cares about the long-term and does not care about the present, or only cares about the present and does not care about the long-term, is unrealistic. This is not just a leadership method issue, but essentially a reflection of a metaphysical viewpoint.

    The relationship between organizing collective production and arranging the personal lives of commune members.

    Chairman Mao said long ago: "Organizing revolutionary wars and improving the lives of the masses are our two major tasks." And he said, "Want the masses to put all their strength into the front line? Then, ... we must care about the suffering of the masses, we must sincerely seek the interests of the masses, and solve the production and life problems of the masses," which points out to us the importance of correctly solving the relationship between collective production and the personal lives of the masses.

    In the large-scale water and soil basic construction, some comrades only cared about leading production and ignored caring about the lives of the masses. This is essentially putting production and life in opposition. Facts have proved that doing so not only fails to mobilize the production enthusiasm of the masses, but also affects the labor enthusiasm of the masses to a certain extent. Suyang Brigade of Yangwang Commune is a typical example. The cadres and masses of this brigade have a high enthusiasm and great determination for large-scale water and soil basic construction. At the beginning of the movement, they fought a beautiful battle, completing 40% of the project in less than 40 days. However, when the second battle began, problems arose. Some wanted to ask for leave, and some wanted to adjust their jobs. In particular, fewer female commune members came. What is the reason? It is that the actual life problems of the masses have not been solved well. This made us understand that production is done by people, and the ultimate goal of production is to better improve people's lives. Therefore, the more tense production is, the more we should care about the lives of the masses; and only by solving the life problems of the masses can we boost the enthusiasm of the masses and make production better. In actual work, we have initially established a correct production view and mass view, and have also found many specific ways to solve the life problems of the masses. For example, some conducted visits to the poor and asked about their needs; some organized logistics supply groups; some formulated labor and rest systems; some organized carts and horses to pull coal and buy vegetables for the masses to solve the problem of firewood and vegetables; some also organized temporary sewing groups, adopting the method of working for work and equivalent exchange to solve the problem of clothing for the masses. In short, while grasping production, we properly solved the personal life problems of the commune members. Because of this, the enthusiasm of the masses became more and more sufficient, and the production movement formed a climax one wave after another, achieving one new achievement after another.

    既要发扬革命精神　又要坚持科学态度
    山西省新绛县委副书记　张春华
    “什么叫工作，工作就是斗争”。从新绛县去年冬季群众性的水、土基本建设运动中，更加深刻地证明了毛主席的这个指示是颠扑不破的真理。为了响应中共山西省委“关于动员全民，奋战五年，建设两个一千五百万亩稳产高产田的决议”的号召，全县各级党的组织，带领广大干部群众，认真总结历史经验，广泛进行调查研究，发扬大寨人敢想敢干、改天换地的革命精神，迅速掀起了一个大规模的以水、土为中心的农田基本建设运动。仅仅两个月的时间，就取得了很大的成绩。全县共新打井一百零八眼，扩建新建机电灌站十三处，挖泉截流十一处，新开渠道三百九十三条，扩大了水地一万八千零四十七亩，治碱六百亩；整修土地六万零八百三十八亩，其中建成大寨田二万一千三百三十四亩。
    这样一个改天换地的大规模的群众运动，能够健康地向前发展，除了要作好思想工作和组织工作外，最重要的一条就是努力学习毛主席著作，自觉地运用毛泽东思想，总结历史经验，加强调查研究，经常抓住活的思想，切实处理好四个方面的关系。
    敢想敢干的革命精神和实事求是的科学态度的关系
    要治水治土，改变自然面貌，首先必须实现人的思想革命化，改变人的精神状态。使人们具有远大的革命理想，坚定的革命意志，敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神和雷厉风行、说干就干的革命化作风。只有这样，才能不怕鬼、不信邪，解放思想，破除迷信，大胆创造，排除万难。这些道理说起来似乎平常，人人懂得，但是，实际并非如此。我们的农业尽管实现集体化多年了，可是许多同志的思想与社会主义的大农业的要求并不完全相适应。他们想问题，办事情，做工作，总还是小手小脚，踢不破小农经济的圈子。只从本社、本队、本单位的利益打算，不从全县、全省、全国，甚至全世界的利益考虑，不能把自己的利益，本社、本队的利益和整个革命事业的利益联系起来。比如，我们动员干部、群众大搞水、土建设时，一些先进社、队的同志就反映出骄傲自满、故步自封、安于现状、不求上进的思想，说什么“生产差不多了，到了顶了”；相反，一些后进社、队的同志却有悲观的观点，无所作为，甘于作大自然的奴隶，说什么“咱条件差，费的劲儿再大也上不去。”等等。这些论点就象“金箍咒”一样，把自己的思想箍得紧紧的。这表明，我们的一些同志还不理解毛主席的教导：“客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结。”“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来”。面对这一事实，县委在发动群众的基础上，又组织县级有关干部到先进地区去观摩学习。边看边议，看人家，比自己，找差距，就实论虚，反复比较，反复讨论，这样由物质到精神，再由精神到物质，使大家受到了教育，提高了认识。明确了敢不敢与天、与地搏斗，是敢不敢革命，要不要革命的大问题，而要革命就必须有个雄心壮志，有个革命气魄。从而鼓起了革命干劲，克服种种困难，掀起了大搞水、土基本建设的热潮。
    实践证明，光有雄心壮志和革命热情还不够，还必须具有实事求是的科学态度。因为生产革命和打仗一样，既要有战略目标、又要有战术计划，决不能空喊口号。这就是说，大搞水、土基本建设运动，不仅要有计划，而且计划要可靠。要做到这点，就必须尊重科学，尊重客观规律，把敢想敢干的革命精神和实事求是的科学态度结合起来。客观事物是非常复杂的，客观规律是不以人的意志为转移的。只有通过事物的表面现象看到内在联系，抓住它的发展规律，因地制宜，实事求是地去干，才能达到我们的愿望。领导者的任务，就是掌握火候，当冷静的革命促进派。运动初期，经过一系列工作，当绝大多数干部的革命热情起来之后，有的同志就不够冷静，想把明天才能办的事，也拿到今天来办。有的就主张：“干脆，一切工作都停下来，专门搞水、土建设”。显然，这是不切实际的。如果听任这种现象发展下去，那就必然走上主观唯心主义的道路，最后形成脱离实际，脱离群众。毛主席早在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书的序言中，就指出：“任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情”。根据这个指示，县委及时地帮助大家认识到，敢想敢干的精神是好的，它能冲破迷信和保守，但决不可违背科学、违背客观规律，决不可“无根据地胡思乱想”地去干工作。否则，不从实际出发，随心所欲，把幻想当成真理，那就成了主观唯心论了。客观规律是无情的，谁要在它面前“调皮”，那就非受到历史的惩罚不可。并在这个基础上，结合具体情况，经过反复讨论，修订和落实了计划。这样就有效地保证了运动的健康发展。
    发扬共产主义风格和贯彻社会主义按劳分配、自愿互利、等价交换政策的关系
    在以治水、治土为中心的农田基本建设运动中，有相当数量的工程和活动，需要几个大队以至几个公社、几个县统一行动，联合作战，才能完成。比如，治理汾南的峨嵋岭和汾北的吕梁山上的全部土地，以及开发鼓堆山下的龙王泉干渠等等，都不是这些地区某一个大队甚至某一个公社的力量所能够办成的。因此，就必须发扬共产主义精神和风格，开展必要的生产协作。但是，在进行具体工作时，又必须注意划清发扬共产主义风格和贯彻党的政策的界限。一定要严格坚持自愿互利、等价交换的原则，确保社会主义按劳分配的政策的顺利执行。只有一丝不苟地按照党的政策办事，才能够更好地保护和发扬共产主义的精神和风格，才能够充分调动和发挥群众的劳动积极性和创造性。然而，有的同志还不很了解这个道理。一说搞协作就摇头摆手，只怕重犯过去的错误。这种精神状态，实际上是自己“划地为牢”。也有的人脑子过热，忘记了党的政策，说什么：“共产主义大协作还讲什么你我”。这实际上是对理想和现实缺乏正确的认识，把未来当成现在。对于这些问题，我们都在萌芽阶段就注意解决了。所以运动的发展一直是健康的。
    长远建设和当前生产的关系
    长远建设是发展社会主义农业生产的根本大计。不进行长远建设，农业生产非但不能发展，就是守摊保本也是保不住的。只顾眼前，不顾长远，只顾今天，不顾明天，目光短浅，无所作为，是小农经济的思想反映。要领导好社会主义的大农业，就得站得高，看得远，既看到眼前，又看到长远，树立牢固的长远建设思想。这是我们共产党人应有的风度和气魄。但是，另一方面，又不可忽略了当前生产。因为当前生产乃是长远建设不可分割的组成部分。只有抓好当前生产，才能使长远建设立于可靠的基础之上。这也是我们共产党人应有的唯物辩证法观点。因此，在大规模的水、土基本建设运动一开始，县委就考虑到合理安排、统筹兼顾的问题，提醒各级党组织的领导同志，无论在指导思想上、组织安排上、具体工作上各个方面，都要有全面观点；提出“以长远建设促当前生产，以当前生产保长远建设”的行动口号；并再三强调在工程安排上，要讲究实效，保证增产，多搞花钱少，受益多，速度快的小型工程，力争搞一处，成一处，在小麦、棉秋田冬浇和春浇中用一处。尽管如此，在一些地方仍出现了当前生产抓得不够的现象。有些地方甚至把百分之六十以上的全半劳力集中到水、土基本建设上来，把当前生产如麦田管理（特别是冬浇）、秋耕扫尾、积肥送肥、植树造林、多种经营等工作丢在一边。这就不可避免的使当前生产受到严重影响。发现这一状况，县委立即召开会议，引导大家全面深入地检查总结了前段工作，进一步清醒了大家的头脑，同时，组织大家到全县十八个长远建设和当前生产关系处理得较好的大队进行了学习参观。从这些典型参观中，大家看到了事物的互相制约、互相联系、互相影响的因果关系，使大家认识到任何只顾长远不顾当前，或者只顾当前不顾长远的做法，都是不现实的，这不单是个领导方法问题，实质上是一种形而上学的观点的反映。
    组织集体生产和安排社员个人生活的关系
    毛主席早就说过：“组织革命战争，改良群众生活，这是我们的两大任务。”并说：“要群众拿出他们的全力放到战线上去么？那末，……就得关心群众的痛痒，就得真心实意地为群众谋利益，解决群众的生产和生活的问题”，这就给我们指出了正确解决集体生产和群众个人生活的关系的重要性。
    在大规模的水、土基本建设中，有些同志只顾领导生产，而忽略了关心群众生活。这实质上是把生产和生活对立了起来。事实证明，这样做，不仅不能把群众的生产积极性调动起来，而且会使群众的劳动积极性在一定程度上受到影响。阳王公社苏阳大队就是一个典型的例子。这个大队的干部和群众大搞水、土基本建设的积极性很高，决心很大。运动一开始，就打了个漂亮仗，不到四十天就完成了工程的百分之四十。但是，当第二个战役开始时，问题就来了。有的要请假，有的要调整活计。特别是妇女社员来的更少了。什么原因呢？就是没有把群众的实际生活问题解决好。这就使我们懂得了生产是靠人搞的，生产的最终目的就是为了更好的改善人们的生活，因此，生产越紧张越应该关心群众的生活；也只有把群众的生活问题解决好，群众的干劲才能鼓足，生产才会搞得更好。在实际工作中，我们初步树立了正确的生产观点和群众观点，而且找到了不少解决群众生活问题的具体办法。比如，有的进行了访贫问寒；有的组织了后勤供应组；有的制订了劳逸制度；有的组织了车马给群众拉煤炭、买菜，解决烧柴、吃菜的问题；有的还组织了临时缝纫小组，采取以工顶工，等价交换的办法，解决了群众的穿衣问题。总之，在抓好生产的同时，妥善解决了社员群众的个人生活问题。正因为如此，群众的干劲越鼓越足，生产运动一浪接一浪形成高潮，取得了一个又一个的新成绩。
