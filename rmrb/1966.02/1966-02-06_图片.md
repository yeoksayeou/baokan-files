    Members of the Uxin Zhao Commune in Inner Mongolia have constructed over 3,000 mu of stable and high-yielding farmland on sandy land. Although the drought was severe last year, they still achieved a good harvest in both summer and autumn. In the past, the Uxin Zhao area did not produce grain, but now it is 70 percent self-sufficient in grain. This is the millet they harvested.
