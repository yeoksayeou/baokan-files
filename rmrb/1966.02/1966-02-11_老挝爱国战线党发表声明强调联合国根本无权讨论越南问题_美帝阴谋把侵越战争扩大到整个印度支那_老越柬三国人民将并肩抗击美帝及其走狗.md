    New China News Agency, Kang Kai, 9th. A broadcast from Pathet Lao Radio on the 8th reported that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party issued a statement on the 5th, pointing out that U.S. imperialism's actions of resuming the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and submitting the Vietnam issue to the United Nations Security Council further exposed its aggressive nature.

    The statement pointed out that the United Nations has absolutely no right to discuss the Vietnam issue. The Vietnam issue can only be resolved in accordance with the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front.

    The statement pointed out that the United States' conspiracy to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to the entire Indochina was already evident when it played the trick of "pausing the bombing." At that time, it intensified the dispatch of American troops to South Vietnam, launching extremely barbaric "sweeps" against the people of South Vietnam; directed its lackey troops to launch large-scale offensives in various parts of Laos, especially in central and lower Laos, intensifying the bombing of the Lao liberated areas; and prepared to directly send troops to invade Laos. At the same time, it also increasingly frantically carried out provocations and attacks against Cambodia.

    The statement said that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party strongly condemns U.S. imperialism's actions of continuing to bomb the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and submitting the Vietnam issue to the United Nations Security Council, strengthening the war of aggression against South Vietnam and Laos, and intensifying provocations against Cambodia, and demands that it stop these aggressive actions. The statement said that the U.S. government must withdraw all its and its servants' troops, weapons, and war materials from South Vietnam, permanently stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the true and sole representative of the people of South Vietnam, recognize that the affairs of the Vietnamese people should be resolved by the Vietnamese people themselves, and respect the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue. At the same time, the United States must also stop its provocations against Cambodia, respect the 1962 Geneva Accords on the Laos issue, withdraw all U.S. military personnel, weapons, and war materials from Laos, and stop bombing the Lao liberated areas, allowing the Lao people to solve their own internal affairs.

    The statement concluded by saying that as U.S. imperialism is expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam to the entire Indochina, the Lao people, as brothers of Vietnam and Cambodia with thousands of kilometers of borders, will, on the basis of the resolutions of the Indochina People's Conference in March 1965, further strengthen their solidarity with the fraternal peoples of Vietnam and Cambodia, fight shoulder to shoulder against the aggression and interference of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, defend their own independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and defend peace in Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world.

    老挝爱国战线党发表声明强调联合国根本无权讨论越南问题
    美帝阴谋把侵越战争扩大到整个印度支那
    老越柬三国人民将并肩抗击美帝及其走狗
    新华社康开九日电  据巴特寮电台八日广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会五日发表声明指出，美帝国主义恢复轰炸越南民主共和国和把越南问题提交联合国安全理事会的行动，进一步暴露了它的侵略本质。
    声明指出，联合国根本无权讨论越南问题，解决越南问题只能按照越南民主共和国的四点主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五项声明进行。
    声明指出，美国要把侵略越南的战争扩大到整个印度支那的阴谋，早在它玩弄“暂停轰炸”的时候就已经表现出来。当时它加紧增派美军到越南南方，对越南南方人民发动极其野蛮的“扫荡”；指使它的走狗军队在老挝各地特别是中寮和下寮地区展开大规模的进攻，加紧对老挝解放区的轰炸；并且准备直接出兵侵略老挝，同时，它还日益疯狂地对柬埔寨进行挑衅和进攻。
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会强烈谴责美帝国主义继续轰炸越南民主共和国和把越南问题提交联合国安全理事会，加强对越南南方和老挝的侵略战争以及加强对柬埔寨进行挑衅等行动，并且要求它停止这些侵略行动。声明说，美国政府必须把它和它的仆从的军队、武器和作战物资全部撤出越南南方，永远停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸，承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民真正唯一的代表，承认越南人民的事务应该由越南人民自己解决，尊重一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，同时，美国还必须停止对柬埔寨的挑衅，尊重一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，把美国的军事人员、武器和作战物资全部撤出老挝，并且停止轰炸老挝解放区，让老挝人自己解决自己的内部事务。
    声明最后说，在美帝国主义正在把侵越战争扩大到整个印度支那的时候，作为同越南和柬埔寨有着数千公里边界的兄弟——老挝人民，将在一九六五年三月印度支那人民会议的决议基础上，进一步加强同兄弟的越南人民和柬埔寨人民的团结，并肩反对美帝国主义和它的走狗的侵略和干涉，保卫自己的独立、主权和领土完整，保卫印度支那、东南亚和世界的和平。
