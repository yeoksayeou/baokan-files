    Xinhua News Agency, Quito, 13th dispatch: Students in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, once again angrily attacked the US embassy with stones on the 11th. This was the third demonstration in front of the US embassy since the new anti-American, anti-dictatorial wave was set off by the people of Ecuador on the 27th.

    On the way to the US embassy, the students waved their fists and shouted slogans such as "Down with US imperialism!" and "Death to US imperialism and the military dictatorship!" When they arrived at the US embassy, the demonstrators became even more agitated, shouting anti-American slogans even louder, and then attacked the embassy building with stones, fighting with the Ecuadorian police guarding the embassy.

    On the 10th, the US-Ecuadorian Cultural Center was also attacked for the third time by demonstrators. Students smashed the glass windows of this cultural aggression institution with stones.

    On the 11th, hundreds of university students and workers in Guayaquil also took to the streets to hold anti-American, anti-dictatorial parades, holding up a huge banner that read: "Down with the mastermind – US imperialism! Down with the pawns of US imperialism – the military dictatorship!" As the marchers passed the headquarters of the Second Military District, they attacked the building of this suppression organ with stones.

    Police rushed into the ranks of the marchers to commit atrocities, but the demonstrators, while singing the national anthem and shouting the slogan "Yankees go home!", fought back with stones and bricks, struggling with the police.

    After this, the demonstrators dispersed into groups and held a series of flash rallies in the city center.

    As the anti-American, anti-dictatorial struggle intensifies and spreads to seven provinces, schools throughout Ecuador have been closed, and commercial, industrial and financial activities in cities such as Quito, Guayaquil, Cuenca, and Loja have ceased.

    The terrified pro-American military dictatorial authorities have dispatched large numbers of military police in recent days to suppress patriotic masses in major cities. Many people have been arrested or injured. Guayaquil has virtually entered a state of military alert, and the authorities have transferred troops, tanks, and fighter jets from various places. However, these repressive measures cannot stop this storm of struggle, which has lasted for half a month.

    厄瓜多尔反美反独裁斗争扩及七省
    全国学校停课　首都工商业活动停止
    新华社十三日讯　基多消息：厄瓜多尔首都基多的学生十一日再次用石头愤怒袭击美国大使馆。这是二十七日厄瓜多尔人民掀起新的反美反独裁浪潮以来第三次在美国大使馆前面举行的示威。
    在前往美国大使馆的路上，学生们挥动拳头，高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”、“美帝国主义和军事独裁该死！”等口号。在到达美国大使馆的时候，示威者情绪更加激愤，更加响亮地高呼反美口号，接着便用石块袭击了使馆的建筑，并同守卫使馆的厄瓜多尔警察进行了搏斗。
    十日，美国—厄瓜多尔文化中心也遭到了示威者的第三次袭击。学生们用石头打碎了这个文化侵略机构的玻璃橱窗。
    十一日，瓜亚基尔数百名大学生和工人也上街举行反美反独裁游行，他们高举着一条巨大的横幅标语，上面写着：“打倒主谋犯——美帝国主义！打倒美帝国主义的爪牙——军事独裁！”游行者经过第二军区机关时，用石头袭击了这个镇压机关的建筑物。
    警察冲进了游行队伍逞凶，但是示威者一面唱着国歌和高呼“美国佬滚出去！”的口号，一面用石头和砖块还击，同警察搏斗。
    在这以后，示威群众分散成小组，在市中心举行了一系列闪电集会。
    随着反美反独裁斗争的激化和扩展到了七个省，厄瓜多尔全国的学校已经停课，基多、瓜亚基尔、昆卡和乐哈等城市的商业、工业和金融业也停止了活动。
    心惊胆战的亲美军事独裁当局连日来出动大批军警，在各大城市大肆镇压爱国群众。已经有不少人被捕或受伤。瓜亚基尔实际上已经进入了军事戒备状态，当局从各地调来了部队、坦克和战斗机。但是这些镇压措施制止不了这次历时已经半个月的斗争风暴。
