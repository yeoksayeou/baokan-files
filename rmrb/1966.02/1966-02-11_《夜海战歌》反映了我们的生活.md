    "Night Sea Combat Song" reflects our life
    Wang Muchang, First Class Merit Citation Recipient of East Sea Combat, Sergeant of the Engine Room, "Meng Hu" [Fierce Tiger] Boat, Chongwu
    The staging of "Night Sea Combat Song" is timely and successful. The characters are vivid, the plot is realistic, and it reflects our life. Although only Boat 878 appears on stage, it summarizes the basic features of the troops.
    The entire play is permeated with Mao Zedong Thought, embodying the power of Mao Zedong Thought in combat. Boat 878 is a strong unit that adheres to the "Four Firsts." The Party branch even held an emergency branch committee meeting at the moment the battle was about to begin, playing a fortress role in the combat.
    The comrades' high morale and eagerness for battle in the play are also very real. When there is a situation at the front, no one wants to sleep. Sometimes we get up two or three times in the middle of the night. Some comrades go to look at the nautical charts, some listen to the phone, and some go to the commander to ask questions. When there is a combat opportunity, the mood is even higher. Sometimes we run around all night without engaging, and when we are called back, we feel a little uncomfortable, just like some comrades on Boat 878.
    At the front, soldiers are afraid of leaving the unit, mainly because they fear missing out on combat. Like the political instructor Tie in the play who actively requests to leave the hospital, and Ding Changbao who doesn't want to send his father home, such situations also exist with us. Many comrades are willing to be tempered in combat like Yu Leng, Zhou Yanhua, and Zhou Haisheng in the play.
    The whole play also reflects the close relationship between the military and the people. The political instructor went to explore the waterways and received the help of Old Grandpa and the militiamen; some militiamen were injured, and the soldiers went to the hospital to express their sympathy; when waiting for an opportunity, the militia team came to deliver water... Our victory in battle is absolutely inseparable from the support of the people.

    《夜海战歌》反映了我们的生活
    猛虎艇轮机军士长崇武以东海战一等功臣  王木昌
    《夜海战歌》编演的很及时，也很成功。人物形象很生动，情节很真实，反映了我们的生活。虽然舞台上出现的只是八七八艇，但概括了部队的基本面貌。
    全剧贯穿了毛主席思想，体现了毛主席思想在战斗中的威力。八七八艇是坚持“四个第一”过硬的部队，党支部在战斗即将打响的时刻，还召开了紧急支委会，在战斗中起到了堡垒作用。
    剧中同志们高昂的求战情绪，要求出击也很真实。我们在前方，有情况时谁也不想睡，有时半夜起来两三次，有的同志去看看海图，有的去听听电话，有的到指挥员那里去问问。有战机要出去打，情绪就更高了，有时跑一晚上没打上，叫返航，心里就有些不自在，就象八七八艇上有的同志似的。
    在前方，战士怕离开部队，主要怕打不上仗。象剧中铁指导员积极要求出医院，丁长宝不想送他父亲回家，这样情况在我们那里也有。有很多同志都象剧中的于楞、周燕华、周海胜那样愿意到战斗中去锻炼。
    全剧也体现军民之间的密切关系。指导员去探水道，得到了老阿公、民兵们的帮助；有的民兵负伤了，战士们到医院去慰问；在待机时民兵队来送水，……我们战斗的胜利和人民的支援是绝对分不开的。
