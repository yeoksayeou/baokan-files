    (Xinhua News Agency, 7th) Honolulu dispatch: U.S. President Johnson's two-day meeting with U.S. military and political heads and the heads of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky, etc., to plot the expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, began today in Honolulu.

    Yesterday, in his speech when Nguyen Van Thieu and others arrived in Honolulu, Johnson, addressing the recent intensified disputes within the U.S. ruling group, emphasized that the U.S. "cannot accept" the logic of those in the U.S. who "advocate retreating in Vietnam." He pointed out that the U.S.'s "center of attention has now shifted (from Europe) to another part of the world (Asia)," and that the U.S. "must be as firm as in the past." He described the just struggle of the Asian people, especially the Vietnamese people, to rise up and resist the U.S. aggressors as "aggression," and expressed deep unease about the far-reaching significance of the Vietnamese people's victory in their struggle. He said, "If we allow the communists to win in Vietnam, it will be easier for them to take over other countries in other parts of the world...we will have to fight again somewhere else."

    Before the meeting between the U.S. military and political heads and the heads of the South Vietnamese puppet regime began, U.S. Commander in Vietnam Westmoreland held a meeting with Johnson for more than an hour on the 6th. When answering questions at a subsequent press conference, Westmoreland said that the issue of further increasing the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam was "being studied," and that he would "discuss my requirements in this regard" with Secretary of Defense McNamara and others.

    Westmoreland admitted that the morale of the South Vietnamese puppet troops was low and that desertions had increased significantly. He also admitted that the U.S. "cannot expect to defeat the enemy with a single battle or campaign." He said, "We must prepare for a long war."

    He put forward the so-called five-point military strategy for the U.S. in Vietnam: namely, to defend the main population centers, such as Saigon and the provincial capitals; to gradually establish lines of communication; to defend the U.S.'s base circle; to keep as many U.S. troops in Vietnam as possible in a mobile state, in order to "fight the main forces" of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army; and to continue bombing North Vietnam. The five-point military strategy put forward by Westmoreland is just the same old stuff that the U.S. aggressors have long been implementing and has proven unable to save them from defeat.

    As the Honolulu meeting between the heads of the U.S. and the South Vietnamese puppet regime began, the U.S. military authorities in Saigon announced today that the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam has exceeded 200,000, reaching 200,001.

    美帝国主义是不会甘心失败的
    约翰逊叫嚷要“坚定”，不从越南后退
    承认美国已把战略重点从欧洲转移到亚洲
    威斯特摩兰在檀香山会议之前宣布五点侵越战略
    据新华社七日讯　檀香山消息：美国总统约翰逊同美国军政头目和南越伪政权头目阮文绍、阮高其等策划扩大侵越战争的两天会谈，已于今天在檀香山开始。
    约翰逊昨天在阮文绍等到达檀香山时的讲话中，针对美国统治集团中最近激烈化的争吵，强调美国“不能接受”美国国内那些“主张在越南后退”的人的逻辑。他指出，美国“现在注意的中心已（从欧洲）转移到世界的另一部分（亚洲）”，美国“必须象过去一样坚定”。他把亚洲人民，特别是越南人民奋起抗击美国侵略者的正义斗争说成是“侵略”，并且对越南人民斗争胜利的深远意义表示深感不安。他说，“如果我们让共产党人在越南取胜，他们接管世界其他部分的其他国家就比较容易……我们将必须在其他某个地方再度战斗”。
    在美国军政头目同南越伪政权的头子的会谈开始之前，侵越美军总司令威斯特摩兰在六日同约翰逊举行了一个多小时的会晤。威斯特摩兰在事后举行的记者招待会上回答问题时说，进一步增加侵越美军的问题“正在研究中”，他将同国防部长麦克纳马拉等“谈我在这方面的要求”。
    威斯特摩兰承认，南越伪军士气低落，开小差的人大大增加。他并且承认，美国“不能指望一次战斗或战役就能把敌人打败”。他说“我们必须准备长期战争”。
    他提出了美国对越南的所谓五点军事战略：即保卫主要的居民中心，如西贡和各省会；逐步建立交通线；保卫美国的基地圈；使尽可能多的侵越美军处于机动状态，以便同南越解放军的“主力军战斗”；继续轰炸越南北方。威斯特摩兰提出的五点军事战略都是美国侵略者早在执行、并证明不能挽救它失败的老一套货色。
    在美国和南越伪政权的头目檀香山会谈开始的同时，西贡美军当局今天宣布，侵越美军已经超过二十万人，到达二十万零一千人。
