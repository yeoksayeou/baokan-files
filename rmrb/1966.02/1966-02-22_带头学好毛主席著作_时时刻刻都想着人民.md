　　Take the Lead in Studying Chairman Mao's Writings
    Thinking of the People at All Times
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was a county Party secretary, and I am also a county Party secretary. We both have the same heavy responsibilities, and the Party's demands are equally high. Comrade Jiao Yulu made such great contributions to the revolution, but my work is not good enough. What is the reason? There are thousands of reasons, but the most important one is that I have not truly grasped Mao Zedong Thought like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and effectively applied it to the transformation of my subjective world and the objective world.
    Acknowledging the gap is one thing, but narrowing the gap is another. Therefore, I am determined to work hard and catch up on the road to revolutionization. Originally, in a county, the county Party secretary is the leader of the revolution. One must think of the people at all times in order to serve the people completely and thoroughly. In the future, I will definitely take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, first take the lead in studying and using Chairman Mao's writings well, thoroughly transform myself, establish a revolutionary world outlook of wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people and the people of the world, throw away all personal distractions, go deep into the front lines, and work with the people of the county to carry out the three great revolutionary movements in a down-to-earth manner, and resolutely struggle to completely change the face of the county.

　　带头学好毛主席著作
    时时刻刻都想着人民
    焦裕禄同志是县委书记，我也是县委书记，担子本来是一样的重，党的要求是一样的高，焦裕禄同志为革命作出那么大的贡献，而我的工作却做得不够好。原因在那里呢？千条万条，重要的一条就是没有象焦裕禄同志那样真正把毛泽东思想学到手，有效地运用到改造主观世界和客观世界中去。
    承认差距是一回事，缩短差距又是一回事，因此，我决心奋发图强，在革命化的道路上，迎头赶上去。本来，在一个县里，县委书记是革命的带头人，头脑中要时时刻刻想着人民，才能完全、彻底地为人民服务。今后，我一定以焦裕禄同志作榜样，首先带头学好用好毛主席著作，彻底改造自己，树立起全心全意为全中国人民和全世界人民服务的革命世界观，扔掉一切个人杂念，深入第一线，和全县人民一起，脚踏实地地大搞三大革命运动，为彻底改变全县面貌坚决奋斗。
