    According to a dispatch from Phnom Penh on the 4th by Xinhua News Agency, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk said that "President Johnson's notorious 'loud peace offensive,' 'this business' has yielded no results."
    Prince Sihanouk made these remarks in an editorial he wrote for the recently published seventh issue of the "People's Socialist Community" magazine.
    He wrote: "American imperialism has caused serious damage to Vietnam, plunging the Vietnamese people into misery. Now, encouraged by international public opinion and the timidity of relevant governments, American imperialism and its Bangkok and Saigon accomplices are preparing to destroy Cambodia, accusing Cambodia of willingly acting as an accomplice to the Vietnamese communists to a certain extent."
    Prince Sihanouk wrote: "Cambodia is a monarchical country and has no communist tendencies. However, it cannot be allowed to establish such a 'new rule' in the world: that simply because Johnson possesses...atomic bombs, he can force Vietnam to choose a certain system."
    Prince Sihanouk said that imperialism "hates China, they flatter and even fawn on the Soviet Union, which makes China's condemnation of the two nuclear powers trying to cooperate to dominate the world justified."
    He wrote: "Currently, some so-called 'upright' governments and people believe that it is very unreasonable for North Vietnam and South Vietnam to refuse to hold peace talks with the United States." He said, "I think the hypocrisy of these 'well-meaning people' is indeed outrageous. If these people are merely ignorant, then I think it is shocking to be ignorant to this extent."
    He went on to emphasize: "I want to compare Vietnam to a house, the Vietnamese people to the owner of this house, and the Americans to robbers who forcibly broke into this house. These robbers insist that they have every right to occupy this house, to usurp the role of the host to manage this house and to have the power of life and death over this family. If they resist, they have the right to torture them, mutilate them, and even kill them, smash the furniture, and if necessary, burn the house and the owner together. How do these robbers justify this 'right'? It is because the owner of the house wants to paint his house pink or red, which the invaders do not like."
    He said: "Some so-called 'well-meaning people' (I am referring to the United Nations, as well as governments or ecclesiastical authorities who call themselves 'peace envoys') run out and say to the unfortunate owner: 'Respectable man, we understand your disaster, but the people you are fighting against are also kind: look! They are now offering you peace proposals. They kindly advise you to stop fighting and negotiate with them to reach an agreement on your family affairs. It is best that you both reach an agreement on the distribution of property in the house and the reasonable allocation of burdens, responsibilities, and your respective rights in the management of this house, etc. You can reach an understanding with them without resorting to force. Therefore, conduct peace talks with them!'. 'Respectable man, we know that you demand that these great gentlemen first withdraw from your house. But you must also know that without certain guarantees, they cannot satisfy your overly strict demands. For example, you must guarantee not to paint your house red, guarantee not to organize a very united family, because they simply don't like it.'"
    Prince Sihanouk said: "Using individuals as a metaphor, this is the almost unbelievable, yet true image of the 'Vietnam problem.' Who can imagine that in a certain country, there would be such a law, or even such a custom, that would allow such 'arbitration,' allowing robbers to 'negotiate' the cessation of aggression and 'negotiate' the division of the property and even the fate of the robbed?"
    Prince Sihanouk accused certain Western countries and non-aligned countries of equating the American aggressors with the aggressed Vietnam, and the imperialists who practiced colonial rule in Vietnam with the owners of the country, the Vietnamese people. He emphasized: "If they truly love peace and justice, they must demand that the Americans stop violating the 1954 Geneva Accords, thereby simply withdrawing from South Vietnam and never invading North Vietnam again." Prince Sihanouk finally wrote: Cambodia and Vietnam "now and in the future unanimously believe: 'We want peace, yes, but not peace at all costs, not peace in exchange for national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.'"

### 西哈努克亲王说约翰逊“和平攻势”没有得逞  不允许在侵略者被侵略者之间进行“仲裁”  指出中国谴责苏美力图合作主宰世界是理直气壮的

    西哈努克亲王说约翰逊“和平攻势”没有得逞
    不允许在侵略者被侵略者之间进行“仲裁”
    指出中国谴责苏美力图合作主宰世界是理直气壮的
    据新华社金边四日电　柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王说，“约翰逊总统臭名远扬的‘大张旗鼓的和平攻势’‘这笔生意’没有得到任何结果。”
    西哈努克亲王是在他为最近出版的第七期《人民社会同盟》杂志写的一篇社论中讲这番话的。
    他写道：“美帝国主义者给越南造成了严重的破坏、把越南人民置于水深火热之中，现在美帝国主义及其曼谷和西贡的帮凶由于国际舆论和有关政府的胆怯而受到了鼓励，准备摧毁柬埔寨，他们指责柬埔寨在一定程度上心甘情愿充当越南共产党人的同谋者。”
    西哈努克亲王写道：“柬埔寨是一个君主制的国家，毫无共产主义的倾向。但是，不能容许在世界上建立起这样一条‘新规矩’，那就是：仅仅因为约翰逊拥有……原子弹，他就可以强使越南选择一定的制度。”
    西哈努克亲王说，帝国主义“仇恨中国，他们讨好、甚至奉承苏联，这就使中国关于这两个核大国力图合作主宰世界的谴责理直气壮”。
    他写道：“目前，一些所谓‘正直’的政府和人士认为，北越和南越拒绝同美国进行和谈是十分没有道理的。”他说，“我觉得这些‘好心人’的伪善的确令人愤慨。如果说这些人仅仅是出于无知，那我认为无知到这种地步也是令人吃惊的。”
    他接着强调指出：“我要把越南比作一所房子，把越南人民比作这所房子的主人，把美国人比作强行闯进这所房子的强盗。这些强盗硬说他们完全有权霸占这所房子，有权喧宾夺主来管理这所房子和对这一家人操生杀之权，如果他们反抗，就有权拷打他们，残害他们，甚至杀死他们，捣毁家具，必要时连房子带主人一起烧光。这些强盗怎样为这种‘权利’辩解的呢？就是因为房子的主人要把自己的房子漆上粉红色或红色，而这是侵略者所不喜欢的。”
    他说：“一些所谓‘好心人’（我指的是联合国，以及自称为‘和平使者’的政府或教权当局）跑出来对倒霉的主人说：‘规矩人呀，我们了解你们的灾难，但是，你们与之作斗争的人也是善良的：看！他们现在向你们提出和平建议了。他们好心地劝你们停止战斗，同他们谈判以达成解决你们家里的事情的协议。最好是你们双方就分配房内的财产和在这所房子的管理方面合理分配负担、责任和你们各自的权利等等达成协议。你们可以同他们取得谅解而不诉诸武力。因此，同他们进行和谈吧！’。‘规矩人呀，我们知道，你们要求这些大人先生们首先撤出你们的房子。但是，你们也必须知道，没有某些保证，他们是不能满足你们的过于严厉的要求的。比如你们要保证不把自己的房子漆上红色，保证不组织一个非常团结的家庭，因为他们根本不喜欢这样。’”
    西哈努克亲王说：“用个人来作比喻，这就是‘越南问题’的令人几乎不能置信的然而却是真实的形象。有谁能够想象，在某一个国家里，会有这样一种法律，甚至这样一种风习，竟然容许这样的‘仲裁’，使强盗能够‘谈判’停止侵略，‘谈判’瓜分被劫者的财物以至命运？”
    西哈努克亲王指责某些西方国家和不结盟国家把美国侵略者和被侵略者越南，把在越南实行殖民统治的帝国主义者和国家的主人越南人民相提并论。他强调指出：“如果它们真正热爱和平和公理，就必须要求美国人停止违反一九五四年日内瓦协议，从而干脆从越南南方撤走，并且再也不侵犯越南北方。”西哈努克亲王最后写道：柬埔寨和越南“现在和将来都一致认为：‘要和平，是的，但不是不惜一切的和平，不是拿国家的独立、主权和领土完整来作交易的和平’。”
