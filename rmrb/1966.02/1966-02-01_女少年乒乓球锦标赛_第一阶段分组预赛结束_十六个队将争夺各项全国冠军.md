    女少年乒乓球锦标赛
    第一阶段分组预赛结束
    十六个队将争夺各项全国冠军
    据新华社三十一日讯  一九六六年全国二十一单位女少年乒乓球锦标赛今天结束了第一阶段分组预赛。
    曾经在前年观看过第一届二十一单位女少年乒乓球锦标赛的著名乒乓球选手庄则栋，观看了这次比赛后，把初步印象归纳为三点：两年来女少年选手的水平大有提高；技术上样数比以前多了，什么打法都有；小选手们打得积极主动，斗志昂扬，不管打得到打不到，有机会就打，这种精神最可嘉。
    这次进行的中学基层队团体赛、小学基层队团体赛、混合队团体赛和代表队团体赛，各有四个队获得了分组预赛的第一名。这十六个队将在二月二日开始进入第二阶段决赛，争夺各个项目的全国冠军。这十六个队是：
    小学基层队团体赛：南宁市中山北段小学队、上海市巨鹿路第一小学队（去年的冠军）、太原市铁路第六小学队（前年的第四名）、广州市宝庆坊小学队。
    基层队团体赛：广州市第一中学队（去年的第五名）、北京市师范大学附属女子中学队
  （去年的第三名）、沈阳市育才学校队、上海市第五十五中学队（去年的亚军）。
    混合队团体赛：河北队（去年的亚军）、辽宁队、吉林队、上海队（去年的冠军）。
    代表队团体赛：广西队、黑龙江队、上海队、湖北队。
    一月三十日上午，著名乒乓球选手庄则栋、李富荣、徐寅生、张燮林、林慧卿、郑敏之、李赫男、梁丽珍等会见了来自各地的二百多名女少年乒乓球小将们。徐寅生应邀给这些小选手们讲了话，他根据自己活学活用毛主席著作和打球的实践经验，鼓励大家认真学好毛主席著作，听党的话，作一个红色的革命接班人。庄则栋等到练习室里辅导小选手练球。小选手得到优秀选手的帮助和指点，非常高兴。
