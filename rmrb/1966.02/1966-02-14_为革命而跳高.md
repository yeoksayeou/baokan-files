    High Jumping for the Revolution
    Wu Fushan, Department of Physical Education, Beijing Normal College

    Editor's Note: Comrade Wu Fushan is a renowned high jumper. She recently attended the Beijing Municipal Conference on Exchanging Experiences in Studying Chairman Mao's Works. In this article, using examples of her own continuous improvement in high jumping, she vividly illustrates the principle that Mao Zedong Thought commands everything and that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work.

    Comrade Mao Zedong has consistently taught us that we must combine revolutionary spirit with practical spirit, "not only possessing the courage to overwhelm everything, but also the ability to control the changing developments of the entire war."

    Comrade Wu Fushan acted according to Comrade Mao Zedong's words. Strategically, she despises difficulties and possesses the ambition to dare to act, dare to break through, and dare to climb to the peaks. Tactically, she values difficulties, treating every achievement as "zero," practicing basic skills rigorously and strictly. It is precisely because she is good at combining fearless revolutionary spirit with strict scientific spirit that she can continuously leap from one height to another new height.

    Linking High Jumping to Revolution

    Since I was little, I loved to jump and leap. When I was in elementary school, I spent my days climbing poles and jumping high, playing everything. Among them, I particularly liked high jumping. At that time, I only wanted to have fun. To say that I was truly interested in high jumping, it started when Zheng Fengrong broke the world record. In November 1957, I was studying in junior high school when I heard the news that Zheng Fengrong had broken the world record. I was particularly impressed that a Chinese girl jumped higher than any other woman in the world, defeating the Americans. It felt great. If anyone still said that China was the sick man of East Asia, then please take a look at Zheng Fengrong's high jump. I felt both proud and admired, and I secretly made up my mind: to learn from her, study hard, and exercise to strengthen my body, so that I could win glory for the motherland in the future.

    After the First National Games, the leadership sent me to study at the Department of Physical Education of Beijing Normal College. During the 1960 National Track and Field Championships, which coincided with the opening of the 17th Olympic Games, the leadership demanded that the National Track and Field Championships this year should demonstrate a level comparable to the Olympics. In the past, I had heard that sports should serve politics and was a political struggle, but I didn't really understand it. Only this time did I truly realize that the competition on the sports field was a competition of politics. At that time, Zheng Fengrong and I were the only women in China who could jump over 1.70 meters. We should shoulder the task of demonstrating a high level. There were only a few days left before the competition, but I happened to catch a severe cold. Even on the day of the competition, I was still feeling dizzy. During the competition, the bar was raised to 1.55 meters, and I failed twice. According to the rules, each person can jump a maximum of three times at each height. If the third attempt also fails, it's over. Could I jump over it? At that moment, I looked at the red vest with the two big characters "Beijing" printed on it, and I looked at the audience on the stands, with so many eyes watching me. Thinking about the demands of the Party and the people, and realizing that whether my high jump performance was good or bad was a major issue related to the honor of the motherland and the struggle against the imperialist reactionaries, I suddenly felt that it wasn't just me jumping, but that I was representing the people of all of Beijing and all of China. I felt much stronger, and finally I achieved second place with a result of 1.70 meters. Although I demonstrated a high level, I felt that I hadn't completed the task well. After the competition, I resolved to work even harder to win glory for Beijing and for the motherland.

    In a competition in May 1963, I jumped over 1.73 meters, improving my result. The bar was raised again to 1.75 meters, and again, my first two attempts failed. On the third attempt, I had just taken a few steps when I felt that my steps were wrong and awkward. At that time, I thought, if I just muddled through the jump, I would definitely fail. But no one would blame me. If I stopped and restarted, others would definitely say that I was a coward and was afraid. But I immediately realized that making a careless jump would be irresponsible to the Party and the people. In order to be responsible to the revolution and strive for a good result, I couldn't be afraid of what others said and couldn't be afraid of losing face. So, I stopped in front of the bar. While walking back, I rethought the movements, and immediately stood back on the starting line. I demanded of myself that I must jump well, like the comrades of the table tennis team when they were down 0-2. The third attempt was successful, but I thought to myself: In the short two seconds of high jumping, my mind still had distracting thoughts. It was really wrong. If you want to make revolution, you can't fake it. Every jump and every movement must be dedicated to the revolution, without any selfishness. Every jump is a test of us by the Party, and we must cherish every jump. The more difficult it is, the better the opportunity for testing and training.

    The Games of the New Emerging Forces (GANEFO) opened, and I participated in the first GANEFO as a member of the Chinese sports delegation. This competition gave me a deeper understanding of high jumping for the revolution. Athletes from many countries, defying the obstruction of reactionary governments, came to Indonesia at great risk. Some arrived only a few hours before the competition and still achieved good results. Their revolutionary spirit of resolutely fighting against imperialism has always inspired me. During the GANEFO, the revolutionary people of the world were watching GANEFO, hoping for its success. Imperialism and modern revisionism were also watching GANEFO, hoping for its failure. Why? Because we represent not just ourselves, nor just Beijing, nor just China, but all the revolutionary people of the world. In this competition, I jumped 1.70 meters. Although I won the championship, I did not jump my best result. I felt that this was absolutely not a small matter of a few centimeters, but was closely linked to the world revolution. I must work even harder, and with my results, resolutely fight against imperialism and modern revisionism, and strengthen the will of the revolutionary people of the world. I am determined to be a proletarian high jumper, resolutely abandoning the "I," cherishing the motherland, keeping the world in sight, setting up the ambition of the Foolish Old Man, and vowing to climb the highest peak.

    One Must Divide the Objective Conditions into Two

    The task of climbing the peak is placed before us. How should we complete it? The biggest difficulty I faced was that I am not tall, only 1.68 meters. For high jumping, this is a congenital disadvantage. In the first two years, thanks to the concern of the organization, which created very good learning conditions for us, and the acceptance of the experience and lessons of the veteran athletes, I improved relatively quickly. My result quickly rose to 1.70 meters, exceeding my height by two centimeters. However, after jumping over 1.70 meters, my result did not improve for an entire year. At this time, words like "She's probably reached her limit," "She's probably only at the level of 1.70 meters" reached my ears. At first, I was unconvinced, but after a period of time, there was still no progress, and I began to doubt myself, thinking "I am not suitable for sports, let alone high jumping," and even thought "It is already not easy for me to jump 1.70 meters." During that period, because of the low standards in my thinking, my results did not improve. Later, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." Thinking about myself, I felt that the main problem was not that I was too short, but that my thinking was too short. Shortness in thinking is even more terrible than shortness in height. In 1963, my result improved from 1.71 meters to 1.75 meters, and this progress in turn educated me. But after that, some people started talking again. They said: "This time she has completed her historical mission," "She has no more potential." After hearing this, I thought, the leadership believes in me, and I must put forth my full effort. If I am short and have poor conditions, then I will sweat more and put in more effort than others. So, I persisted in training every day. On holidays and vacations when others went home, I still insisted on getting up early to train before going home. Usually, I practiced weighted leg swings. Others tied one sandbag to their legs, but I tied two. I kept a training diary every day, and made summaries every week and every month, not only recording the training situation, but also seriously analyzing and studying the problems in training, and putting forward suggestions for strengthening training, so that the coach could better grasp the training. Doing this, I was quite confident at the beginning, but soon, because of improper training methods, I got sick. I went to the hospital for examination, and the doctor said that it was caused by overwork. I thought: Looking at myself as a sick person, I probably really won't make it. High jumping is really difficult! It is more difficult than anything else. For other work, you can do it well if you work hard, but for high jumping, you work desperately, and you may not be able to improve by one centimeter. At this time, the department organized the study of Lei Feng. I compared my thinking with that of Comrade Lei Feng, and compared my spirit of practicing high jumping with Comrade Lei Feng's spirit of practicing grenade throwing. I felt that I was wavering in the face of difficulties and was impatient, falling into blindness about the conditions. Lei Feng dedicated his limited life to unlimited service to the people. He was even shorter than me, and he was able to practice killing the enemy with great effort, with the enemy in mind, throwing grenades farther and farther. Where did his strength come from? It came from studying Chairman Mao's works. Therefore, to learn from Lei Feng, we must first study Chairman Mao's works. I carefully read articles such as "Serve the People" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." I thought that doing sports is making revolution. What revolution would it be without difficulties? In the future, my results must continue to improve. My height will not increase, and the difficulty is indeed great, but I must advance knowing the difficulties. The appearance of injuries and illnesses shows that the training methods are unscientific and do not proceed from the actual conditions of my body. Being short is an objective reality, which cannot be scared by it, nor can we adopt "the policy of non-recognition," but we must face it squarely. However, this is not shirking responsibility, but analyzing it specifically. In this way, I calmed down, summarized the past experiences and lessons, gradually recovered my health, regained my energy, and continued to practice.

    In 1964, in Taiyuan, I jumped over 1.79 meters, breaking the national record. Some people said again: "This time it was an over-performance, it was a fluke, and it can't be improved anymore." At this time, I was no longer afraid of what others said. I felt that being short was certainly unfavorable, but it could stimulate my enthusiasm, strive for progress, and work hard. Besides, I also have favorable conditions, such as being lighter and more flexible than taller people, reacting faster, and so on. We should fully utilize the favorable factors, give play to our strengths, to make up for our shortcomings, so that we can continue to progress. In particular, we have Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, which is the most favorable condition. Armed with it, we will be fearless, full of revolutionary spirit, and able to overcome any difficulties. In these two years, people are still the same height, but their confidence has become stronger. Conditions are dead, but people are alive. By fully exploiting people's subjective initiative, we can use the favorable to make up for the unfavorable, turn the unfavorable into the favorable, and let the conditions serve you.

    The same is true for other conditions, such as the training and competition venues, climate, and audience. I feel that people cannot work and live outside of objective conditions, nor can they train and compete outside of objective conditions. The question is how to give play to subjective initiative based on these objective conditions and serve our cause. For example, when going to the grassroots for testing and performances, there are many people watching, sometimes so crowded that only a small area is left for you to jump. Some venues are very soft and loose. At this time, I think about how to make full use of these objective conditions to exercise my hard skills and improve my technical level. The audience being a bit "crowded" and a bit "noisy" is not a bad thing. It contains care and hope, and turning it into motivation will make you jump better. Regarding the venue, I would rather jump in a soft venue, because high jumping is different from other events. The higher your result, the more you have to jump backwards. By the time it's your turn, the venue will not be flat and smooth after others have trampled on it. Therefore, you must be prepared to jump well on the worst venue. Jumping more in poorer venues is also about being rigorous and strict, which is the need of actual combat. As for the cold or hot weather and strong winds, there is nothing bad about it. The worse the conditions, the better the opportunity to exercise willpower and technique. Besides, the venue and climate conditions during the competition are the same for everyone. The more you care about the conditions, the worse you will jump. If you are not afraid of it and dare to challenge it, you will get more exercise. The dead conditions are grasped and used by the living people, which in turn promotes your progress.

    Attacking Shortcomings While Giving Full Play to Strengths

    Over the past few years, my high jumping results have experienced greater ups and downs. In a competition in April 1965, I only jumped 1.65 meters, which was 14 centimeters lower than my highest result at the time. At that time, many people were worried about me. I calmly thought: This competition was very bad in terms of results, but the gains were still quite great. First, the reaction to the previous injury was not great, and it withstood the test of the competition. Second, after the test of actual combat, the problems in the usual training were exposed. Jumping poorly is a bad thing, but isn't it a good thing that the problems have been discovered? Actual combat proved that my training was not up to standard, especially my take-off technique was not good, and I didn't see any improvement after working on it for a winter. Originally, my technical strength was that my leg swing had a greater effect, and I would bring my body up with a swing, but now I don't have it. This shows that I did not handle the relationship between the two well. By focusing on the shortcomings and grabbing the shortcomings, I completely separated the strengths and shortcomings, and as a result, I lost the strengths as well. After analysis, my mind became clear, and my confidence became stronger. Chairman Mao said that under certain conditions, bad things can be turned into good things. I thought, what are the conditions for turning this bad thing into a good thing? The first is firm confidence, and the second is to conduct basic skills training in a down-to-earth manner, and prepare to use indomitable perseverance to promote it to transform in a good direction. After clarifying that I should attack shortcomings while giving full play to my strengths, I insisted on a set of basic skills training every day. After more than a month, the strengths played a role, the shortcomings have been improved, and in May I jumped over the height of 1.78 meters. Looking back, if it weren't for that failure, I might not have been able to discover the problem, solve the problem, and improve the technology so quickly. Chairman Mao was right, grasping the main contradiction, and other contradictions will be readily solved. I feel that the process of improvement is also a process of discovering contradictions, recognizing contradictions, and solving contradictions. We must dare to break through and dare to compete, and make discoveries in the competition and break through. Recognizing the contradictions and solving the contradictions, we will also have made progress.

    The Ideological Bar Must Rise Every Day

    After accepting the lesson of jumping 1.65 meters and grasping the basic skills training, the situation gradually improved. In the competitions at the grassroots level for several consecutive weeks, the results rebounded week by week. Many comrades asked with concern: "When will you jump 1.80 meters?" This contains encouragement, as well as requirements and hopes. I also felt the weight of the responsibility on my shoulders. Facing the hopes of the leaders and comrades and the actual training situation, I felt that I should jump over 1.80 meters, but I was inevitably nervous, fearing that I would not be able to complete the task, and feeling pressured. I think that if a person is not focused and does nothing, he cannot do a good job. If there is no "pressure" on your body, you will lose weight, but it depends on what is pressing? Is it a heavy burden, or a heavy responsibility? Carrying a burden will only make you bend your knees, bend your waist, and only see your toes, and you are sure to fall. But taking on a responsibility, even if it is heavier, will make us raise our heads, straighten our chests and backs, have a broad vision, and have firm steps. The "pressure" on our shoulders should be a heavy responsibility, not a burden. I thought: I am a Communist Party member, and I should dare to shoulder heavy responsibilities and attack the task of 1.80 meters. So why am I a little afraid? It must be that I am carrying a burden. Opening Chairman Mao's "Get Rid of the Burden, Start the Machine" and comparing it, I was indeed carrying the burden of achievement, thinking that I can jump so high, so I was afraid of not jumping well. At this time, I remembered what the counselor had said to me: "Achievements and honors can only represent your past, but cannot explain your future." That's right, jumping 1.78 meters, 1.79 meters, that is already a thing of the past. Quickly unload the burden and take on the responsibility. In the future, we should be like the national table tennis team, with the ambition of "The towering barriers were like iron, but now we are stepping over them from scratch" for continuous improvement, dare to despise the new height, and at the same time be very careful in specific tactics with an attitude of starting from scratch. So, when I formulated the battle plan before the competition, I set a goal - 1.80 meters, and I must strive to jump over it, and specifically when jumping at each height, I must concentrate my energy and jump seriously, put aside the question of whether I can pass or not, and focus on paying attention to the correct performance of the technology, and strive to jump over each height for the first time, to create conditions for jumping 1.80 meters. In the competition, the first attempt failed, and the second attempt also failed, but there were no other distracting thoughts in my mind, only thinking about how to accept the lessons of the previous two failures, and paying attention to doing the movements step by step. In this way, on the third attempt, I completed the planned plan and jumped over 1.80 meters. I realized that despisal without specific attention is empty, and without the courage to despise the enemy, it is impossible to achieve true attention.

    Over the past few years, I have made some progress, and the Party and the people have given me very high honors. Every bit of my progress is permeated with the Party's care, training, and the strict requirements and patient help of the comrades. I now love high jumping even more, because I feel that it can cultivate our spirit of continuous revolution and daily improvement. Everyone knows that the high jumping competition ends with three failures at a certain height. My companion joked to me: "The high jumping project is interesting! It always ends in failure." I think this joke is quite reasonable. This "ending in failure" has a profound meaning. It reminds us to always look at problems in two, especially when there is great progress, we must see our own problems, and cannot be satisfied with the status quo and be self-contained. No matter how high you jump, you have to have a height where you fail three times for the competition to end. Breaking the record does not mean that there are no problems. If there were no problems, then why would you hit the bar three times? Don't these three "failures" show that there are still problems? This "failure" reminds us that even if we have made great achievements, we must never be complacent and become arrogant, but we must see that the gap is still very large. You have improved your results, which means that you have made progress and solved some contradictions. But this "failure" tells us that there are new contradictions waiting for us to solve, and we must prepare to meet new difficulties with greater efforts and greater humility, to continuously revolutionize, to thoroughly revolutionize. The bamboo bar is allowed to be knocked down, but the ideological bar can never fall. Only when the ideological bar rises rapidly every day can it promote the continuous rise of the high jumping bar.

    Now I have jumped over 1.80 meters. 1.80 meters is only a new starting point in my progress, and it is a small episode in the prelude to the improvement of the level of high jumping in our country. The climax is still to come. On the eve of the Second National Games, Shanghai's female high jumper Xuan Xiaomei jumped over 1.81 meters, raising the national record by another centimeter. It is really like the waves of the Yangtze River pushing the waves forward, and each wave is higher than the previous one. When I sat in the stands and watched Xuan Xiaomei jump over this height, I felt indescribably happy. I not only saw Xuan Xiaomei create this good result that entered the world's top three, but also discovered that there is great potential to be tapped in her technology. I firmly believe that in the movement of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping, more Xuan Xiaomeis will appear in our country, and more excellent results will appear. At present, the level of track and field sports in our country is still very backward. Changing the backward situation is a very arduous task. But I know that as long as we seriously study Chairman Mao's works, and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds well, we will not be afraid of anything, and we will dare to shoulder any burden. I want to work with my companions to shoulder heavy responsibilities and bravely break through. A person's ability may be great or small, but I want to break through for the revolution, to compete for time for the revolution, and seize time, timely summarize experiences and lessons, carry forward the spirit of hard work, hard work, practical work, and clever work, and do my best to reach the highest standards that can be reached, and build a large step for the early climbing of our country's sports to the world's peak. I firmly believe that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people will definitely become world high jumping champions.

### 为革命而跳高

专栏：

    为革命而跳高
    北京师范学院运动系　吴浮山
    编者按：吴浮山同志是著名的跳高运动员。这次她出席了北京市召开的学习毛主席著作经验交流会。在这篇文章中，她以自己不断地提高跳高成绩的事例，生动地说明了毛泽东思想统帅一切，毛泽东思想是一切工作的指针的道理。
    毛泽东同志一贯教导我们：要把革命气概和实际精神结合起来，“不但有压倒一切的勇气，而且有驾驭整个战争变化发展的能力。”
    吴浮山同志照着毛泽东同志的话去做，在战略上，她藐视困难，具有敢干、敢闯、敢于攀登高峰的雄心壮志；在战术上，她重视困难，把每一个成就当做“零”看待，从难从严，苦练基本功。正是由于她善于把大无畏的革命精神同严格的科学精神结合起来，就能够不断地从一个高度跃进到另一个新的高度。
    把跳高和革命联系起来
    从小我就爱蹦蹦跳跳。上小学时，整天不是爬竿，就是蹦高，什么都玩，其中比较喜欢的要数跳高了。那时只图玩的痛快，要说对跳高真感兴趣，那得从郑凤荣打破世界纪录说起。一九五七年十一月，我正在初中学习，听到郑凤荣打破世界纪录的消息，特别佩服，一个中国姑娘比世界上任何女子跳的都高，战胜了美国人，真过瘾。谁要还说中国是东亚病夫，那就请他瞧瞧郑凤荣的跳高吧。我又自豪、又敬佩，暗暗下了决心：向她学习，努力学习和锻炼身体，将来也为祖国争光。
    第一届全运会后，领导上把我送到北京师范学院运动系学习。一九六○年全国田径运动会时，正赶上开第十七届奥林匹克运动会，领导上要求这一年的全国田径运动会，要和奥运会比出水平。过去自己也听说体育要为政治服务，也是政治斗争，可自己并不明白，这一次才真正体会运动场上的较量，就是比政治。当时我国女子能跳过一点七○米的只有郑凤荣和我，比出水平的任务，我们应该承担起来。离比赛只剩几天了，可我偏偏得了重感冒，直到比赛那天，还是昏沉沉的。在比赛的时候，横竿升到一点五五米，我两次没跳过去。按照规则，每人在每个高度上最多可以跳三次，如果第三次还跳不过去，就算吹了。能不能跳过呢？这时我看看身上印有“北京”两个大字的红背心，又看看台上的观众，多少双眼睛在看着我。想想党和人民的要求，想到我跳的成绩好坏是关系到祖国的荣誉和向帝国主义反动派作斗争的大问题，顿时觉得不是我一个人在跳，而是代表了全北京、全中国的人民，劲儿变得大多了，最后以一点七○米的成绩获得第二名。虽然跳出了水平，但觉得任务完成的不好。比赛后，我下决心加倍苦练，为北京争光，为祖国争光。
    一九六三年五月的一次比赛中，我跳过了一点七三米，提高了成绩。横竿又升到一点七五米，又是前两次试跳都失败了，第三次我刚跑了几步，觉得步子跑错了，不得劲。我当时想，如果这样凑合跳，肯定跳不过去，但别人谁也不会责怪我；如果我停下来重跳，别人一定会讲我是胆小鬼，害怕了。但我马上意识到稀里糊涂一跳，是对党和人民不负责任。为了对革命负责，争取跳出好成绩，就不能怕别人说，不能怕丢人。于是我跑到竿前还是停了下来，在走回去的时候，重新想想动作，马上又站在起跑线上。我要求自己一定要跳好，要象乒乓球队的同志在零比二时那样。第三次试跳是成功了，但自己想：跳高那么短短两秒多钟的事，思想上还有杂念，真是不应该。要干革命就不能掺假，每一跳，每一个动作都必须兢兢业业为革命，来不得半点私心。每一跳都是党对我们的考验，必须珍惜这每一跳，越是困难，就越是考验和锻炼的好机会。
    新运会召开了，我作为中国体育代表团的成员，参加了第一届新运会。在这次比赛中，使我对为革命而跳高有了进一步的认识。不少国家的运动员，不怕反动政府的阻挠，担着很大的风险来到印度尼西亚；有的在比赛前几个钟头才赶到，还创造了较好的成绩。他们这种与帝国主义坚决斗争的革命精神，一直鼓舞着我。在新运会期间，世界上一切革命的人民注视着新运会，盼望着它成功。帝国主义和现代修正主义也在注视着新运会，盼望着它失败。为什么？因为我们代表的不是我们个人，也不只是北京，也不单单是代表中国，而是代表世界上一切革命的人民。我在这次比赛中跳了一点七○米，虽然取得冠军，但没有跳出我的最高成绩。我觉得这绝不是差几厘米的小事，而是和世界革命紧紧的连在一起的。我一定要加倍苦练，以自己的成绩，与帝国主义、现代修正主义作坚决的斗争，长世界革命人民的志气。我决心作一个无产阶级的跳高运动员，坚决抛弃“我”字，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，立下愚公志，誓攀最高峰。
    对客观条件要一分为二
    攀登高峰的任务摆在我们面前，应该怎样去完成呢？我遇到的最大的困难是我的个子不高，只有一点六八米。对从事跳高来讲，是个先天的不利条件。在起初的两年里，由于组织上的关心，为我们创造很好的学习条件，加上接受了老队员的经验教训，自己进步的比较快，成绩很快提高到一点七○米，超过我的身高两厘米。但是跳过一点七○米以后，整整一年，成绩没有提高。这时，“她大概到头了”，“她那个儿也就一点七○米的水平”的话传到我的耳朵里。我开始是不服气，但过了一阶段，还是没什么进展，自己对自己也开始怀疑起来，觉得“我这人不适合干体育，更不是干跳高的料”，还认为“我这个人跳个一点七○米已经不简单了”。那一阵因为思想上低标准，所以成绩没长进。后来，我学习了毛主席的著作。毛主席说：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物”。联想到自己：我感到主要不是个儿太矮了，而是思想太矮了。思想上的矮比个儿矮还可怕。一九六三年我的成绩由一点七一米提高到一点七五米，这点进步也反过来教育了自己。但这以后有些人又议论开了。他们说：“这回她可完成了历史使命了”，“没啥潜力了”。自己听了以后想，领导上相信我，我就要拿出全力来。个儿矮，条件差，就比别人多流点汗，多下点功夫。于是自己天天坚持锻炼，节日假日别人回家，我还是坚持早起锻炼完了才回家。平时练习负重摆腿，别人在腿上绑一个沙袋，我就绑两个。我每天记训练日记，每周、每月作小结，不仅记下了训练情况，而且认真分析研究训练中的问题，提出加强训练的意见，以便使教练更好地掌握训练。这样干，开始时还挺有信心，但是不久，由于训练不得法，得了病。去医院检查，大夫说这是过度疲劳造成的。我想：象我这个病鬼样，大概真的不成了。跳高真难啊！比干什么都难，干别的工作，好好地干就得了，可跳高拼命练，还不一定能提高一厘米。这时，正好系里组织学雷锋。我把自己的思想和雷锋同志对比，把自己练跳高的精神和雷锋同志练手榴弹的精神对比，觉得自己在困难面前就动摇，急躁，是对条件陷入了盲目性。雷锋以自己有限的生命投入无限的为人民服务中去，他的个子比我还矮，都能带着敌情，苦练杀敌本领，把手榴弹越投越远。他的力量是从那里来的呢？是从学习毛主席著作中来的。因此，学雷锋先要学毛主席著作。我又仔细地读了《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》等文章。我想自己干体育就是干革命，要没有困难还叫什么革命？今后成绩还得继续提高，个儿不会再长，困难的确很大，但要知难而进。出现伤病说明训练方法不科学，没有从自己的身体条件的实际出发；个矮是个客观实际，既不能被它吓倒，也不能采取“不承认主义”，要正视它，又不是推脱责任，而是要具体分析它。这样我冷静下来，总结了过去的经验教训，逐渐恢复了健康，又鼓起干劲，接着练习了。
    一九六四年在太原，我跳过一点七九米，打破了全国纪录。有的人又说：“这回可是超水平发挥，是蒙上的，再也提高不了啦”。这时我再不怕别人说了。我觉得个矮固然不利，但它可以激发我的积极性，奋发图强，何况自己还有有利的条件呢，比如象我这矮个儿，比大个子体重轻些灵活些，反应快点等等。应该充分利用有利的因素，发挥特长，去弥补不足，这样就能不断进步。特别是我们有毛泽东思想作武器，这是最最有利的条件。用它武装起来，就会天不怕、地不怕，浑身充满革命干劲，什么困难都能克服。这两年人仍旧是那么高，但自己信心反倒足了。条件是死的，而人却是活的。充分发挥人的主观能动性，就能以有利弥补不利，变不利为有利，让条件为你服务。
    对于其他条件，如训练和比赛时的场地，气候和观众等也是一样。我觉得人不能脱离客观条件去工作和生活，也不能脱离客观条件去训练和比赛，问题是怎样根据这些客观条件，发挥主观能动性，为我们的事业服务。比如下基层测验和表演，看的人很多，有时挤的只留下你能跳的一小块地方；有的场地很软，很松。这时我就想，怎样充分利用这些客观条件来锻炼我的硬功夫，提高我的技术水平。观众“挤”点、“嚷”点，并不是坏事，这里包含着关心和希望，把它变成动力，就会跳的更好。关于场地，自己倒愿意在软场地跳，因为跳高不同于其他项目，你的成绩越高，就越得后跳，等别人把场地捣烂了才轮到你。后跳时场地就不会是平平整整的。所以要准备在最坏的场地上跳出好成绩。多在差点的场地上跳，也是从难、从严，是实战的需要。至于天气冷热、风大等也没什么坏处。条件越差，越是锻炼意志和技术的好机会。再说比赛时的场地、气候等条件，对大家全一样。你越计较条件，越跳不好。你不怕它，敢和它挑战，就越能得到锻炼。死的条件被活的人所掌握和运用了，反倒促使你前进。
    在发挥特长的前提下攻特短
    几年来，我的跳高成绩，出现过较大的起伏。一九六五年四月份的一次比赛，我才跳了一点六五米，比当时的最高成绩低了十四厘米。当时不少人都替我着急。我冷静地想：这次比赛从成绩看很不好，但收获还是蛮大的。一是前段受伤的反应不大，经住了比赛的考验；另外是经过实战考验，平时训练中的问题暴露出来了。比的不好是坏事，但发现了问题所在，这不是好事吗？实战检验了我的训练是不过硬的，特别是自己的起跳技术不好，抓了一冬，没见改进。原来我的技术特长是摆腿作用较大，一悠就把身体带上去了，而现在却没有了。这说明没有摆好两者关系，就特短而抓特短，把特长和特短截然割裂开来，结果把特长也丢了。经过分析，头脑清楚了，信心更足了。毛主席说，在一定的条件下，坏事可以变好事。自己想把这坏事变好事的条件是什么呢？第一信心坚定，第二就是踏踏实实地进行基本功训练，并准备用百折不回的毅力，去促使它向好的方向转化。明确了应该在发挥特长的情况下攻特短，我就天天坚持一套基本功训练。经过了一个多月，特长发挥了作用，特短有所改进，五月间我就跳过了一点七八米的高度。回想起来，要是没有那次失败，也许还不会那么快发现问题，解决问题，提高技术。毛主席说的真对，抓住了主要矛盾，其它矛盾就迎刃而解了。我觉得提高的过程也就是一个发现矛盾、认识矛盾、解决矛盾的过程。要敢闯、敢比，在比和闯中去有所发现。认识了矛盾，解决了矛盾，我们也就有所前进了。
    思想上的横竿要天天向上
    接受了跳一点六五米的教训，抓住了基本功训练，情况渐渐好转，在连续几周下基层的比赛中，成绩一周周回升。不少同志关心地问：“啥时跳一点八○米？”这包含着鼓励，也包含着要求和希望。自己也感到肩上责任的分量。面对领导和同志们的希望和实际训练情况，自己觉得应该跳过一点八○米，但不免也怪紧张的，怕自己完成不了任务，身上有压力。我想一个人如果无所用心，无所作为，那是干不好工作的。身上如果没有“压力”，是要失重的，但要看压的是什么？是沉重的包袱呢，还是重担子？背上包袱只会是屈膝、弯腰，两眼只看到自己的脚尖，准要栽跟斗的；而挑上担子，那怕是重些，但我们会抬头挺胸腰杆直，眼光远大，步伐坚定。我们肩上的“压力”，应该是重担子，而不该是包袱。我想：自己是个共产党员，应该敢于承担重担，攻一点八○米的任务。那自己为什么有点怕呢？准是背了包袱。翻开毛主席的《放下包袱，开动机器》一对照，我确是背上了成绩的包袱，认为自己是跳多高多高的，所以才怕跳不好。这时我想起辅导员对我说过：“成绩和荣誉，只能代表你的过去，而不能说明你的未来。”对，跳一点七八米，一点七九米，那已经是过去的事了，快卸下包袱，挑起担子。今后应该象国家乒乓球队那样，对于继续提高有“雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越”的雄心，敢于藐视新高度，同时又要以从零开始的态度，在具体战术上非常重视。于是我在赛前制订作战计划时，就订了一个指标——一点八○米，一定要争取跳过去，而具体在跳每个高度时，都要集中精力认真跳，抛开过不过的问题，落实到注意技术的正确发挥上，并争取每个高度都第一次就跳过去，为跳一点八○米创造条件。在比赛的时候，第一次试跳没有过去，第二次又失败了，但我的脑子里没别的杂念，只想怎样接受前两次跳不过去的教训，注意一步步地扎实做好动作。这样，在第三次试跳时，我完成了预定的计划，跳过了一点八○米。我体会到，离开具体重视的藐视是空洞的，而离开敢于对敌人的藐视，那也做不到真正的重视。
    几年来自己有了些进步，党和人民给了自己很高的荣誉，我的每一点进步中都浸透着党的关心、培养，和同志们的严格要求、耐心帮助。我现在更加热爱跳高了，因为我觉得它可以培养我们不断革命、天天向上的精神。谁都知道，跳高比赛是以一个高度上三次不过而结束比赛的。我的同伴跟我开玩笑说：“跳高这项目有意思啊！总是以失败告终。”我觉得这玩笑倒挺有道理。这“以失败告终”意义深长，它提醒我们时时要一分为二地看问题，特别是进步大时，更要看到自己的问题，不能满足现状，故步自封。无论你跳的多么高，可你也得有个高度是三次不过，才算比赛结束。打破了纪录不是没有问题了，要没有问题，那为什么还会碰三次竿呢？这三次“失败”不正说明还有问题吗？这“失败”提醒我们，即便取得了很大的成就，也绝不能自以为是，骄傲起来，要看到差距还很大。你提高了成绩，说明你有进步，解决了一些矛盾。但这“失败”告诉我们，又有新的矛盾等待我们去解决，要准备以更大的努力和更大的虚心，去迎接新的困难，要不断革命，要彻底革命。竹横竿许可碰掉，但思想上的横竿永远不能掉下来。只有思想上的横竿天天向上，迅速地升高，才能促使跳高横竿的不断升高。
    现在我跳过了一点八○米，一点八○米只是自己前进中的又一个新的起点，是我国跳高运动水平提高的序幕中的一个小小的插曲，高潮还在后头。第二届全运会前夕，上海的女子跳高运动员旋晓梅跳过了一点八一米，把全国纪录又提高了一厘米，这真是长江后浪推前浪，一浪更比一浪高。当我坐在看台上，看旋晓梅跳过这个高度的时候，心里有说不出的高兴。我不仅看见旋晓梅创造了这个进入世界前三名的好成绩，而且还发现她的技术中有很大的潜力可挖。我坚信在比学赶帮超的运动中，我国会出现更多的旋晓梅，出现更多的优异成绩。现在我国的田径运动水平还很落后，改变落后面貌是一个很艰巨的任务。但是我知道，只要认真地学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想好好地武装起我们的头脑，我们就什么也不怕，什么担子都敢挑，我要和我的同伴们一起，挑起重担，勇敢地去闯。一个人的能力有大小，但我要为革命去闯，为革命去争时间，抢时间，及时总结经验教训，发扬穷干、苦干、实干、巧干的精神，尽自己的最大努力达到可能达到的最高标准，为我国体育早日攀上世界高峰搭个大台阶。我坚信在毛泽东思想的指引下，中国人一定能成为世界跳高冠军。
