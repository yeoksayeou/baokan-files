　　Chen Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, received Jin Jingmai, the author of the novel "Ouyang Hai's Song," on the evening of the 24th and discussed some important issues in socialist literary creation.

　　After listening to Jin Jingmai's report on the process and experience of creating this book, Comrade Chen Yi pointed out that "Ouyang Hai's Song" is a very attractive and good novel, a good work of the socialist era written by a writer cultivated by our Party since the founding of the country. In the past, our stage mostly featured emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, lacking the revolutionary atmosphere of the times. In terms of literary creation, there were also not many excellent works reflecting the current realities of struggle. In the past two or three years, the situation has changed greatly, and we already have films, operas, and plays of our own era. However, this is the first full-length novel that writes about the heroic figures of the socialist era as well as "Ouyang Hai's Song". It can be said that this is a work with epoch-making significance, a new milestone in the history of our literary creation. This is a product of the Party's leadership, the enthusiastic help of the masses, and the efforts of the writer.

　　Comrade Chen Yi said that this novel successfully portrays a heroic image of a person who has raised his class consciousness under the teachings of Mao Zedong Thought, completely lacks individualism, is brave for justice, and is fearless of anything. The author wrote about the characteristics of the heroes of our time. At the same time, the author also wrote about the life of our company in a very profound and realistic way. The characters around Ouyang Hai are also well written. This is a work that can only be written by an author standing at a fairly high level, and it is something to be happy about.

　　Comrade Chen Yi said: Our era is a great era. Since the birth of the Communist Party of China, every period we have experienced has been earth-shattering. For example, we have the Long March of 25,000 li, which is unique in the history of world warfare. In the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, we implemented Chairman Mao's strategy and tactics of people's war and defeated Japanese imperialism, which attempted to destroy China and annex Asia. In the three-year War of Liberation, we annihilated eight million Kuomintang reactionary troops and won the victory of the great people's revolution. What a wealth of exciting things are contained here! While vigorously reflecting the socialist era, it is also the bounden duty of our writers to comprehensively write epics for each of our historical periods.

　　Comrade Chen Yi also asked writers to express what we need to express in accurate, vivid, concise, bold, and popular language. He said that local language should not be used too much in a work, unless it is particularly needed to shape the character of a person, or the dialect itself is particularly good and can be circulated, so that it is conducive to the unity of the national language. Comrade Chen Yi emphasized that writers should strive to study Chairman Mao's works, arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and constantly improve their thinking.

　　Comrade Tao Zhu said that "Ouyang Hai's Song" has been warmly welcomed by readers as soon as it was published and has been highly valued by the Party and all parties. This shows that it is a very successful work, a work of contemporary significance, and it also shows that socialist literature has an unimaginable vast world. The author should take the praise from all parties as an incentive to improve this book as much as possible within the scope of possibilities, and strive to create more and better works.

　　Comrade Tao Zhu said that "Ouyang Hai's Song" successfully wrote about the noble qualities of the heroic figures of the socialist era who do not seek fame, profit, fear hardship, or death, and are devoted to the revolution and the people. In the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, we very much need such heroic figures as role models. Chairman Mao said that we must "re-educate people," that is, to educate them into new people with such qualities. Our cadres, those who have the ability to read, should read this book, which is very beneficial for us to highlight politics and carry out self-revolution. He pointed out that the current class struggle is very sharp. Capitalism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries are mobilizing their writers to create those decadent and declining figures to corrode people's revolutionary will. We have created such a figure shining with communist brilliance and profoundly and realistically written about his growth process, which shows that the emergence of heroes in our era is not accidental, and that our era is an era of the emergence of heroes. For those reactionary literatures, this is a very good opposite, and it has far-reaching significance.

　　Comrade Tao Zhu said that on the road of socialist literary creation, the emergence of "Ouyang Hai's Song" is the result of the People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the direct guidance of Comrade Lin Biao, striving to study Chairman Mao's works and highlighting politics. Comrade Jin Jingmai was just an ordinary actor in the drama troupe a few years ago. He was very young and had been engaged in creation for a short time. However, because he received good training in the People's Liberation Army, had deep class feelings, and loved the army, especially after Chairman Mao emphasized class and class struggle at the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in 1962, the author went to the company to engage in creation with this idea, so he can stand at a certain ideological height and can create such a work. This shows that there is nothing mysterious about creation. As long as we truly arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and immerse ourselves in the practice of struggle, even if we are not writers and have no creative experience, we can write good works. Farmer Wang Xingyuan's writing of the novel "Green Bamboo Village Storms" also proves this point. "People's Daily" has recently published speeches by workers studying Chairman Mao's works one after another, further indicating that it is not difficult for workers, peasants, and soldiers to master culture and theory. This tells us that the era of a few people monopolizing science and culture is gone forever, and we are in a great era of great development of socialist culture.

　　Comrade Tao Zhu finally said that our era is an era of the emergence of heroes, and works like "Ouyang Hai's Song" are too few. We should encourage everyone to write boldly and write more about the heroic figures of our era to promote our socialist revolution and construction cause to advance by leaps and bounds.

　　陈毅、陶铸同志在接见《欧阳海之歌》作者时
　　谈社会主义文学创作的一些重要问题
    赞扬《欧阳海之歌》是一部有时代意义的作品，强调作家要用毛泽东思想武装自己，不断提高自己的思想，深入斗争的实践。
    新华社广州二十六日电　中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅，中共中央中南局第一书记陶铸，二十四日晚上接见了长篇小说《欧阳海之歌》的作者金敬迈，并且谈了社会主义文学创作上的一些重要问题。
    陈毅同志听了金敬迈汇报创作这本书的经过和体会以后指出，《欧阳海之歌》是一部很吸引人的好小说，是建国以来由我们党培养起来的作家写社会主义时代的一部好作品。过去，我们的舞台上演的多是些帝王将相，才子佳人，缺乏时代的革命气息。文学创作方面，反映当前现实斗争生活的优秀作品也不多。近两三年来，情况有了很大转变，我们已经有了我们自己时代的电影、戏曲和话剧。但是写社会主义时代英雄人物的长篇小说，写得象《欧阳海之歌》这样好的还是第一部。可以说，这是一部带有划时代意义的作品，是我们文学创作史上的一块新的里程碑。这是党的领导，群众的热情帮助，作家的努力的产品。
    陈毅同志说，这部小说成功地塑造了一个在毛泽东思想教导下，提高了阶级觉悟，完全没有个人主义，见义勇为，什么都无所畏惧的英雄形象。作者写出了我们时代英雄的特点。同时，作者也很深刻、很真实地写出了我们连队的生活。欧阳海周围的人物也都写得很好。这是作者站在相当高的水平上才能写出来的作品，是值得我们高兴的。
    陈毅同志说：我们的时代是伟大的时代。自从中国共产党诞生以后，我们经历的每一个时期都是惊天动地的。比如，我们有世界战争史上绝无仅有的二万五千里长征。我们在八年的抗日战争中，实行了毛主席的人民战争的战略战术，打败了企图灭亡中国、吞并亚洲的日本帝国主义。我们在三年的解放战争中，消灭了八百万国民党反动军队，赢得了伟大人民革命胜利。这里蕴藏着多么丰富的激荡人心的事啊！我们的作家，在大力反映社会主义时代的同时，如何概括地为我们每一个历史时期写史诗，也是义不容辞的责任。
    陈毅同志还要求作家们的作品要用准确、生动、简洁、泼辣、通俗的语言来表达我们所需要表达的东西。他说，一部作品里，地方语言不宜过多，除非是对塑造一个人物的性格特别需要，或是方言本身特别好而又能通行的才用，这样才有利于全国语言的统一。陈毅同志强调作家们要努力学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己，不断提高自己的思想。
    陶铸同志说，《欧阳海之歌》一出版就受到读者热烈的欢迎，受到党和各方面非常的重视，这说明它是一部很成功的作品，是一部有时代意义的作品，也说明社会主义文学有着不可想象的广阔的天地。作者得到各方面的称赞，应该把这些称赞作为对自己的鞭策，在可能范围内把这本书改得更好，并努力创作出更多更好的作品来。
    陶铸同志说，《欧阳海之歌》成功地写出了社会主义时代英雄人物不图名，不图利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民的高贵品质。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，我们非常需要这样的英雄人物作榜样。毛主席说要“重新教育人”，就是要教育成具有这样品质的新人。我们的干部，有阅读能力的都应该读一读这本书，这对我们突出政治，自我革命很有好处。他指出，当前阶级斗争非常尖锐，资本主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派，正动员他们的作家创作那些颓废、没落的人物，以腐蚀人们的革命意志。我们创造出这样一个闪烁着共产主义光辉的人物，并且深刻地真实地写出他的成长过程，说明了我们时代的英雄产生不是偶然的，说明了我们的时代是英雄辈出的时代。对那些反动文学来说，这是一个很好的对立面，它有着深远的意义。
    陶铸同志说，在社会主义文学的创作道路上，《欧阳海之歌》的出现是人民解放军在党中央和毛主席领导下，在林彪同志的直接教导下，努力学习毛主席著作，突出政治的结果。金敬迈同志在几年以前还是话剧团的一个一般演员，年纪很轻，从事创作的时间很短，但是，由于他在人民解放军中得到很好的锻炼，有深厚的阶级感情，热爱部队，特别是在一九六二年毛主席在党的八届十中全会强调阶级与阶级斗争以后，作者是以这种思想武装起来去到连队从事创作的，所以就能站在一定的思想高度，能创作出这样的作品来。这说明创作也并没有什么神秘。只要我们真正以毛泽东思想武装自己，深入斗争的实践，即使不是作家，没有什么创作经验，也可以写出好的作品来。农民王杏元写出长篇小说《绿竹村风云》，也同样证明了这个问题。《人民日报》最近接连刊载了工人学毛主席著作的讲话，进一步说明工农兵群众掌握文化和理论也并不难。这告诉我们：少数人垄断科学和文化的时代是一去不复返了，我们正处在一个社会主义文化大发展的伟大时代。
    陶铸同志最后说，我们的时代是英雄辈出的时代，象《欧阳海之歌》这样的作品是太少了，应当鼓励大家大胆写，更多地写出我们时代的英雄人物，以推动我们的社会主义革命和建设事业更大踏步地前进。
