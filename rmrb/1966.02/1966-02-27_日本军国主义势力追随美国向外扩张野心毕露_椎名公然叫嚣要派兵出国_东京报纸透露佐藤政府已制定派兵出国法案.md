　　Japanese militarist forces, following the US ambition to expand outwards, expose their ambitions
　　Shiina openly clamors for dispatching troops abroad
　　Tokyo newspapers reveal that the Sato government has formulated a bill to dispatch troops abroad
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 25th – Just as the United States is impatiently demanding that its vassal states send troops to South Vietnam to help expand the war of aggression, Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina openly clamored at a meeting of the House of Representatives on the 24th that Japan has reached the point where it "should specifically discuss and study" the dispatch of troops abroad.
    Shiina's clamoring once again exposed the accomplice face of the Sato government and its ambition to follow the United States in expanding outwards.
    According to Japanese newspapers, Shiina, in this speech, once again clamored that dispatching troops abroad "does not violate the constitution." He said, "The Self-Defense Forces after special training" is "the most suitable" for dispatch abroad. In order to legally send Japanese troops abroad, Shiina proposed "amending the Self-Defense Forces Law."
    He said, "Judging from the recent international situation, it is possible to generate (the need to dispatch troops abroad)," therefore, "it is necessary to study this issue."
    According to the Tokyo Shimbun on the 23rd, the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the "Defense Agency" have formulated a bill that would allow Japan to send troops abroad under the name of "United Nations forces" – the "United Nations Cooperation Bill" outline, and are preparing to amend the "Self-Defense Forces Law" accordingly.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 24th – The Sato government, in order to cooperate with the United States in expanding its military steps to invade Asia, is making legal preparations for dispatching Japanese troops abroad.
    According to the Tokyo Shimbun on the 23rd, the Japanese Foreign Ministry (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) has jointly studied and formulated a bill with the Defense Agency (equivalent to the Ministry of Defense), the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, and the Liberal Democratic Party's Foreign Affairs Research Council that would legalize Japan's dispatch of troops abroad – the "United Nations Cooperation Bill" outline, and is preparing to submit it to this session of the Diet for deliberation.
    According to reports, the bill stipulates that Japan will "fully support" all measures of the United Nations manipulated by the United States. When the "United Nations" decides to use "compulsory military measures," Japan can "provide personnel, labor, military supplies, airports, ports and other bases, and undertake the transportation of military supplies." The bill also proposes that in order to realize these measures of sending troops abroad and participating in wars of aggression, the current "Self-Defense Forces" Law and other relevant domestic laws will be amended accordingly.
    The Akahata, the organ of the Japanese Communist Party, published a commentary on the 24th, exposing that the Sato government's plan is an attempt to assist the United States in promoting military aggression in Asia under the name of "United Nations forces." After the Sato government, under the instigation of the United States, passed the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" and formed a Northeast Asian alliance, it put forward this bill, which shows that the danger of dispatching troops abroad included in the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" is becoming a reality.

　　日本军国主义势力追随美国向外扩张野心毕露
　　椎名公然叫嚣要派兵出国
　　东京报纸透露佐藤政府已制定派兵出国法案
    据新华社东京二十五日电  正当美国迫不及待地要求它的仆从国家向南越派兵帮助扩大侵略战争的时候，日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎二十四日在众议院的一次会议上公然叫嚷，日本已经到了“应当具体地讨论、研究”向国外派遣军队的时候了。
    椎名的这一叫嚷，再次暴露了佐藤政府的帮凶嘴脸和追随美国向外扩张的野心。
    据日本报纸报道，椎名在这次发言中，再次扬言向国外派兵“并不违反宪法”。他说：“经过专门训练的自卫队”，向国外派遣是“最合适的”。为了使日本的军队可以合法开往国外，椎名提出“应当修改自卫队法”。
    他说：“从最近的国际形势看来，有可能产生（向国外派兵的）必要”，因此，“需要就这一问题进行研究。”
    据《东京新闻》二十三日报道，日本外务省和“防卫厅”等已经制定出可以使日本以“联合国军”名义向国外派兵的法案——“与联合国合作法案”纲要，并准备相应地修改“自卫队法”。
    据新华社东京二十四日电佐藤政府为了配合美国扩大侵略亚洲的军事步骤，正在为向国外派遣日本军队进行法律上的准备。
    据《东京新闻》二十三日透露，日本外务省（外交部）已同防卫厅（相当于国防部）、内阁法制局和自由民主党外交调查会等研究制定了一个可以使日本向国外派兵合法化的法案——“与联合国合作法案”纲要，并准备提交这次国会会议审议。
    据报道，法案规定，日本“全面支持”由美国所操纵的联合国的一切措施。在“联合国”决定使用“强制的军事措施”时，日本可以“提供兵员、劳动力、军事物资、飞机场、港湾和其它基地，以及担负军事物资的运输”。法案还提出，为了使这些向国外出兵、参加侵略战争的措施能够实现，将相应修改现行的“自卫队”法，及其它有关国内法。
    日本共产党机关报《赤旗报》在二十四日发表述评揭露，佐藤政府的这一计划是企图以“联合国军”的名义，协助美国推行在亚洲的军事侵略。佐藤政府在美国的唆使下通过了“日韩条约”、结成东北亚联盟之后，又提出这个法案，这表明“日韩条约”中包括的向国外派兵的危险性，正在变成现实。
