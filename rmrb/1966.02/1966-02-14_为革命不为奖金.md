    For the Revolution, Not for Bonuses
    Xue Wenli, a boiler worker at the Liaoyuan Power Plant, once took over his shift and, immediately upon arriving at his post, before even beginning operations, discovered a "hindrance." This hindrance was resolved in a single second upon discovery, and no one else knew about it. However, Xue Wenli reported it to his superiors.
    Some comrades, upon hearing this, said, "This hindrance was resolved in a single second, why bother mentioning it! If Master Xue mentions it, he won't be eligible for the safety bonus this month!" Xue Wenli said, "It's nothing. We workers work for the revolution, not for bonuses. Concealing this 'hindrance' would be dishonest, and we can't do that."
    Even a one-second "hindrance" that no one else knew about, even though this "hindrance" might prevent him from receiving a month's safety bonus, he still reported it truthfully and without concealment. This is truly the true color of the working class. For comrades like Xue Wenli, who "work for the revolution, not for bonuses," how important it is to cultivate a spirit of loyalty and honesty to the revolutionary cause, and how insignificant is a small bonus!

### 为革命不为奖金

    为革命不为奖金
    辽源发电厂锅炉工人薛文礼，有一次接了班，刚进入岗位，还没有操作，就发现了一个“障碍”；这个障碍一经发现，一秒钟就解决了，谁也不知道。可是，薛文礼却向上级报告了。
    有的同志听到这件事以后说：“这个障碍，一秒钟就解决了，何必说它呢！薛师傅这一说，这个月就没有评安全奖资格啦！”薛文礼说：“这没啥，咱们工人干活是为革命，不是为奖金。隐瞒这个‘障碍’就是不老实，咱们可不能干。”
    即使是谁都不知道的一秒钟的“障碍”，即使这点“障碍”会妨碍获得一个月的安全奖金，仍然如实报告，毫不隐瞒，这真是工人阶级的本色。对于像薛文礼这样“干活是为革命，不是为奖金”的同志来说，养成对革命事业忠诚老实的品德何等重要，一点奖金何足道哉！
