　　American Combat Troops Insufficient
　　The *New York Times* of February 21 published an article by military commentator Baldwin on the 20th from New York, entitled "Survey Shows US Combat Troops Insufficient". An excerpt follows:
　　The US armed forces have almost no well-trained, ready-to-deploy troops left to call upon. All available troops have already been thinly deployed in Vietnam and elsewhere. This is the conclusion reached by this reporter after studying the situation of the US regular forces and reserve forces.
　　Almost all US domestic troops with combat equipment have been sent to Vietnam. Except for a few army battalions and Marine Corps battalions and a few squadrons of the Tactical Air Command, no other fully trained and equipped troops can be produced within a few months.
　　There is now not only a lack of well-trained soldiers and field officers, but also a lack of military uniforms and clothing. As for various kinds of ammunition and equipment, some are actually in short supply, and some are facing the hidden danger of insufficient supply. This situation is causing increasing anxiety among the various services.
　　More than 200,000 soldiers are now stationed in Vietnam (and they are supported by strong naval and air forces). There are two divisions in Korea, more than five divisions in Europe, and smaller numbers of troops in other places (including the Dominican Republic). As a result, the level of the US domestic troops has dropped to that of an army undergoing training.
　　To cope with the needs of Vietnam, the standards of experience of the Atlantic Fleet and all other commands have been lowered.
　　According to the various services, this situation of "squeezing" has not improved, but has worsened. It is understood that General Westmoreland has requested that more than 200,000 troops be added to Vietnam in 1966, with a corresponding increase in air support.
　　It is expected that senior officials will soon decide whether and how to meet this demand. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have been recommending a limited mobilization of reserve forces since last spring, but President Johnson and Secretary McNamara have only ordered the strengthening of regular forces by increasing conscription quotas and recruiting more volunteers.
　　In recent weeks, commanders at all levels of the various services have been studying how to best address General Westmoreland's requirements for 1966. The approaches that have been considered include: continuing to gradually increase the regular forces by increasing conscription quotas and recruiting more volunteers as at present; transferring troops from Europe, Panama, Alaska and other places where troops can be mobilized; or selectively calling up National Guard and Reserve personnel.
　　From what has been learned, the first approach (continuing to rely on conscription and recruitment) can only solve a small part of his needs within the time frame that General Westmoreland hopes for, and the result will be, as one officer said, that the regular forces "increase not only very slowly, but also in a disorganized manner," the standards of experience will be lowered and lowered, and the difficulties in scheduling will become more and more numerous.
　　If troops are transferred from Europe and elsewhere, General Westmoreland's requirements can be met in larger quantities, but not all of his requirements. It is said that even mobilizing the National Guard and the Reserve may not meet all of his stated needs, because, in addition to a lack of certain types of well-trained soldiers, there may also be a shortage of various supplies by the end of this year.
　　A recently retired officer (whose last job during his service was related to the Army's mobilization base and strategic reserve work) said, "No matter what course of action is taken [in Vietnam] – whether it continues, gradually expands, or gradually declines, we are in a dangerous situation of scarcity," and there is not much strength to "respond in a graded manner to any serious challenge."
　　The lack of trained personnel and materials (whether actual or with the hidden danger of this) is affecting all branches of the regular army – especially the Army and Marine Corps – as well as the Army National Guard and the Reserve. A National Guard general said: "Today, no division of the Guard in the United States is capable of fighting a battle." Some officers say that there are many reasons for the current predicament of the various services. Many officers in the military have long believed that supplies and equipment cannot have enough leeway to cope with emergency needs.
　　For several years, even before the Vietnam issue became acute, the various services had a tendency to lack inventory (especially parts and ammunition), and the inventory has never been fully replenished.
　　The equipment of the National Guard and the Reserve (especially radios and automatic equipment) was taken away for use by the regular forces, and they were not re-equipped. (Attached picture)

### 美国战斗部队不足

专栏：外论摘要

　　美国战斗部队不足
    二月二十一日的《纽约时报》刊载了军事评论员鲍德温二十日从纽约发出的一篇文章，题为《调查结果表明美国战斗部队不足》。摘译如下：
    美国的武装部队几乎已经没有什么训练有素的、能整装待命的部队能调用了，所有能够使用的部队都已经稀稀拉拉地部署在越南和其他地方了。这是本记者在研究了美国的正规部队和后备部队情况后得出的结论。
    美国国内有战斗装备的部队几乎全已派往越南，除了不多几个陆军营和海军陆战队营以及战术空军司令部的不多几支中队以外，几个月以内是拿不出别的经过充分训练和有充分装备的部队来的。
    现在不但缺乏训练有素的兵员和战地军官，而且军装和衣着用品也很缺乏，至于各种弹药和装备，有的实际已告不足，有的隐伏着供应不足的危险。这种情况正在使各军种日益感到不安。
    现在派在越南的兵员已超过了二十万（而且有强大的海空部队在支持他们），在朝鲜有两个师，在欧洲有五个师以上，在别的地方（包括多米尼加共和国）还有数量较少的部队。这样一来，美国国内的部队的水平就下降到成了一支进行训练的军队了。
    为了应付越南的需要，大西洋舰队和所有其他司令部在经验方面的标准都降低了。
    据各军种说，这种“压榨”的情况不但没有好转，反而恶化了。据了解，威斯特摩兰将军已要求在一九六六年内向越南增兵二十万以上，并相应增加空中支持。
    预料高级方面不久将决定是否满足以及如何满足这一需求。参谋长联席会议从去年春天以来就建议有限度地动员后备部队，但是约翰逊总统和麦克纳马拉部长只是下令以增加征兵名额和多召志愿兵来加强正规部队。
    最近几星期，各军种的各级司令部一直在研究：如何解决威斯特摩兰将军为一九六六年提出的要求最为恰当。已经考虑到的办法有：继续象目前一样用增加征兵名额和多召志愿兵的办法逐渐增加正规部队；从欧洲、巴拿马、阿拉斯加和其他有兵可调的地方调动部队；或者有选择地征召国民警卫队和后备队人员。
    据已经获悉的情况来看，第一种办法（继续依靠征兵和募兵）在威斯特摩兰将军所希望的期限里只能解决他的一小部分需要，而其结果将象一个军官所说的那样：正规部队“增加起来不但非常缓慢，而且杂乱无章”，经验的标准会越降越低，调度方面的困难会越来越多。
    要是从欧洲和别的地方调部队，能够数量较大地满足威斯特摩兰将军的要求，但也不能满足他的全部要求。据说，即使动员国民警卫队和后备队，可能也满足不了他所说的全部需要，因为，除了缺乏某几种训练有素的兵员外，到今年年底时还可能出现各种物资供应不足的现象。
    一位最近退休的军官说（他在服役期间最后担任的工作同陆军的动员基地和战略后备工作有关），“不论（在越南）采取什么行动方针——是继续、是逐步扩大还是逐渐下降，反正我们是处在一种危险的匮乏局面”，没有多大力量能“分等级地对任何严重的挑战作出反应”。
    训练有素的人员以及物资的缺乏（无论是实际已发生的还是隐伏着这种危险的）正在影响正规军的所有各军种——特别是陆军和海军陆战队——以及陆军国民警卫队和后备队。国民警卫队的一位将军说：“今天，美国国内没有哪一师警卫队是能够打一仗的。”一些军官说，造成各军种目前的困难处境的原因很多。军队里的许多军官早就认为，供应品和装备不可能有应付紧急需要的足够余地。
    几年来，甚至在越南问题尖锐化之前，各军种一直有缺乏库存的趋势（特别是零件和弹药），后来也一直没有充分补充过库存。
    国民警卫队和后备队的装备（特别是电台和自动装备）被拿去给正规部队使用了，后来也没有给他们补充配备。（附图片）
