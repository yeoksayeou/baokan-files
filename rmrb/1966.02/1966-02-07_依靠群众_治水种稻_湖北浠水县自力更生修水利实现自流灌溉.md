    Relying on the Masses to Control Water and Cultivate Rice
    ——Xishui County, Hubei Province, Relies on Its Own Efforts to Build Water Conservancy and Achieve Self-Flow Irrigation
    Xishui County is located in the hilly area of eastern Hubei Province and mainly grows rice. This area has historically been prone to drought. Every year after the summer solstice, when rice seedlings need a lot of water, the “drought demon” arrives, lightly lasting from one month to fifty days, and severely causing droughts of more than a hundred days. In the sixteen years since liberation, this county has experienced eight years of drought lasting one month to fifty days, and six years of drought lasting seventy days to over a hundred days. Before liberation, the water conservancy facilities here consisted of only 48,000 ponds and reservoirs, with only about 12 percent of the total paddy field area being irrigated and guaranteed a harvest. After liberation, some small-scale water conservancy projects were built successively, but the drought-prone situation remained unchanged.
    In 1958, the state invested in the construction of the large-scale Bailianhe Reservoir in this county. At that time, because the education of cadres and masses on self-reliance was not carried out, and sufficient mobilization of the masses was not paid attention to, the construction of supporting projects such as canals did not keep up, and the role of large-scale reservoirs could not be brought into full play. Some people also developed the idea of simply relying on the state. Some projects that could be done with "indigenous" methods had to be done with "foreign" methods; some problems that could be solved by commune members with labor accumulation had to be solved with state money. From 1963, the state's investment in water conservancy in Xishui County decreased. At this time, some cadres were anxious, and some were discouraged. After repeated discussions and summing up the experiences and lessons of water conservancy construction in the previous years, the Xishui County Committee of the Communist Party of China realized that although water conservancy construction required money, what played a decisive role was the 600,000 people's commune members in the county who had already been organized. Mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses to control water, even with less money, can accomplish great things.
    How to rely on the masses to control water? The Xishui County Committee of the Communist Party of China believed that first, it is necessary to believe that the masses urgently demand to build good water conservancy, and to believe that the masses have the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. The county committee handed the "bottom line" of the state's water conservancy investment to the masses, and organized the broad masses of commune members and cadres to discuss issues such as "Is water conservancy construction a matter for the state or for the masses?" and "If there is less money, will we still control water?"
    Once political and ideological work was grasped, the situation changed. In the discussion, the masses said that water conservancy construction is our own business. The state has already helped build reservoirs, so do we still have to rely on the state to open canals? Especially after extensively carrying out the activity of learning from Dazhai, everyone's ambition to self-reliance and hard work became even higher, and their enthusiasm for water conservancy construction became even greater. The commune members said: The people of Dazhai relied on themselves to cure the poor mountains, can't we rely on ourselves to build good water conservancy? In order to further mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for water control, the county committee also paid close attention to supporting the already excavated canals, so that they could play their role as soon as possible. When the commune members saw the water in the reservoir passing through the mountains and across the rivers and flowing into the fields, their emotions were even higher and their enthusiasm was even greater.
    With the masses mobilized, if funds and materials were insufficient, the commune members calculated everything and saved everywhere. They proposed "If we can avoid spending money, we must resolutely avoid spending money; if 'indigenous' methods can replace 'foreign' methods, we will not think about 'foreign' methods; if we can solve it ourselves, we will not ask the state for it." The East Main Canal of the Bailianhe Reservoir is 107 kilometers long. The technicians once suggested that only the upper section of 46 kilometers should be excavated, and the lower section should be irrigated by electric water lifting because it had to pass through many mountains and rivers, and the project was too difficult. But the commune members did not think so. They believed that to engage in electromechanical irrigation, machines, wires, and electric poles all had to be supplied by the state; to dig canals, it mainly relied on one's own shoulders and hands. Although the project was more difficult, if it could not be dug through in one year, it would be dug for two years, and if it could not be dug through in two years, it would be dug for three years, and it could always be dug through. This is a once-and-for-all thing and can save electricity. In the long run, it is more economical to open canals for self-flow irrigation. The Xishui County Committee supported the opinions of the masses. Now most of the East Main Canal has been built, and after this winter and spring, it can be fully excavated. Because the masses paid attention to saving during construction, the investment was more economical than using electric water lifting irrigation. There are 515 tunnels on the canals throughout the county. If these tunnels were all built with reinforced concrete, a lot of money and a large amount of steel bars, cement, and templates would be needed. The commune members in Guankou District used blue bricks to build them, and the experiment was successful, and the cost was only one-tenth of that of reinforced concrete. The county promoted this method, and more than 470 tunnels below the branch canal were all built with their own fired blue bricks.
    Up to now, in addition to the large-scale Bailianhe Reservoir, Xishui County has also built more than 40 medium-sized and small reservoirs, and excavated nearly 2,000 canals, with a total length of more than 2,500 kilometers, building a self-flow irrigation network of reservoirs connected to canals and canals connected to ponds. The irrigated and guaranteed-harvest paddy fields in the county account for 82 percent of the total paddy field area. With water, the double-cropping area of rice in the county has expanded from more than 110,000 mu in 1957 to 450,000 mu, and nearly 100,000 mu have implemented wheat and double-season rice double-cropping, achieving three harvests a year. In 1965, the county's total grain output exceeded the highest level in history.
    In the winter of 1965, Xishui County launched another large-scale water conservancy construction activity. In the spirit of self-reliance, the commune members continued to dig through the lower section of the East Main Canal of the Bailianhe River, and carried out comprehensive supporting and renovation and reinforcement of the large and small canals that had been excavated. In the water conservancy "dead corners" where the canals could not reach, they also added ponds and built a batch of electric pumping stations. At the same time, the construction of garden plots and field canal networks began.

### 依靠群众　治水种稻——湖北浠水县自力更生修水利实现自流灌溉

    依靠群众　治水种稻
    ——湖北浠水县自力更生修水利实现自流灌溉
    浠水县位于湖北省东部丘陵地带，以种植水稻为主。这里历来易遭干旱，每年夏至一过，正是禾苗大量需要水的时候，“旱魃”就来了，轻则一月到五十天，重则大旱百日以上。解放以后的十六年里，这个县有八年干旱一个月到五十天，有六年旱七十天到一百多天。解放前，这里的水利设施仅有四万八千多处塘堰，灌溉保收的水田只占水田总面积的百分之十二左右。解放以后陆续修了一些小型水利工程，但易旱的状况仍未改变。
    一九五八年，国家投资，在这个县修建了大型的白莲河水库。当时，由于没有在干部、群众中进行自力更生的教育，没有注意充分发动群众，渠道等配套工程的建设没有跟上，未能很好地发挥大型水库的作用。一部分人还产生了单纯依赖国家的思想，有的工程可以用“土”办法干的，也要用“洋”办法；有的可以靠社员用劳动积累解决的，也要国家花钱。从一九六三年起，国家对浠水县的水利投资减少。这时在干部中，有的人着急，有的人泄气。中共浠水县委经过反复讨论，又总结了前几年水利建设的经验教训，认识到水利建设虽然要钱，但是起决定作用的是全县六十万已经组织起来的人民公社社员。把群众发动起来，依靠群众治水，钱少也能办大事。
    怎样依靠群众治水？中共浠水县委认为，首先要相信群众是迫切要求修好水利的，相信群众是有自力更生的革命精神的。县委把国家水利投资的
  “底”交给群众，组织广大社员、干部就“修水利是国家的事，还是群众的事？”“钱少了，还治不治水？”等问题展开讨论。
    一抓政治思想工作，情况就起了变化。群众在讨论中说，修水利是我们自己的事情。国家已经帮助修起了水库，难道开渠道还要靠国家？特别是广泛开展学大寨的活动以后，大家自力更生、艰苦创业的志气更高，修水利的劲头更足。社员们说：大寨人靠自己治好了穷山，我们就不能靠自己修好水利？为了进一步调动群众治水积极性，县委又抓紧对已挖通的渠道进行配套，使它尽快发挥效益。当社员们看到水库里的水穿过大山，跨过河沟，流到了田里，情绪更高，干劲更大了。
    群众发动起来了，资金、材料不足，社员们就事事盘算，处处节约。他们提出“能不花钱的，坚决不花钱；‘土’办法能代替的，不朝‘洋’的想；自己能解决的，不向国家要”。白莲河水库东干渠全长一百零七公里，技术人员曾建议只挖通上段的四十六公里，下段因为要经过不少山岭河沟，工程太艰巨，不挖干渠，改由电力提水灌溉。可是社员们不这样想。他们认为，搞机电灌溉，机器、电线、电杆，得全靠国家供应；挖渠道，主要靠自己双肩和两手，虽然工程难一些，但一年挖不通，挖两年，两年挖不通，挖三年，总可以挖通。这是一劳永逸的事情，而且可以节省电力。从长远看，还是开渠搞自流灌溉比较经济。浠水县委支持了群众的意见。现在东干渠大部分已经修成，再经过这一个冬春，就可以全部挖通。由于群众在施工中注意节约，投资比采用电力提水灌溉更省。全县的渠道上，有五百一十五个隧洞。这些隧洞如果都用钢筋混凝土砌，需要很多钱和大批钢筋、水泥、模板。关口区的社员用青砖砌，试验成功，造价只有钢筋混凝土的十分之一。全县推广这个办法，支渠以下的隧洞四百七十多个，都是用自己烧的青砖砌的。
    到现在，浠水县除了大型的白莲河水库以外，还修建了四十多座中型、小型水库，开挖了近两千条渠道，总长两千五百多公里，建设起一个库连渠、渠连塘的自流灌溉网，全县灌溉保收的水田占水田总面积的百分之八十二。有了水，全县水稻连作面积由一九五七年的十一万多亩扩大到四十五万亩，并有近十万亩实行小麦、双季稻连作，做到一年三熟。一九六五年全县粮食产量，超过了历史上的最高水平。
    一九六五年冬季，浠水县又展开了大规模的兴修水利活动。社员们本着自力更生的精神，继续挖通白莲河东干渠的下段，并对已挖通的大小渠道进行全面配套和整修加固。在渠道伸展不到的水利“死角”，他们还增修了塘堰，兴建一批电力扬水站。同时，开始了园田化、田间渠网化的建设。
