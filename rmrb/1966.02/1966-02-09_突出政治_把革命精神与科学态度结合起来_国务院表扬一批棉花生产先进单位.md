    Emphasize Politics and Combine Revolutionary Spirit with Scientific Attitude:
    State Council Commends a Group of Advanced Cotton Production Units
    Calls on the vast number of commune members in cotton-growing areas to learn from them, catch up with them, surpass them, and push China's cotton production to a higher level.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 8th. In 1965, a large number of advanced cotton production units emerged in the mass campaign of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping in both northern and southern cotton-growing areas of China. The State Council, at the recent Fifth National Cotton Production Conference, commended a group of them with outstanding achievements and certain representativeness, and called on the vast number of commune members in cotton-growing areas to learn from them, catch up with them, surpass them, and push China's cotton production to a higher level.
    The units commended this time include those from the South and the North; old cotton areas and new cotton areas; concentrated production areas and dispersed production areas, from all directions. Among them are provinces and cities, special districts, counties, communes, production brigades, production teams, and state-owned farms. Their common characteristics are: holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works creatively, emphasizing politics, correctly handling the relationship between politics and production, being good at proceeding from reality, closely combining the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle with the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts, so that the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment advance side by side, and winning high cotton yields.
    Among the commended units, many are red flags for achieving bumper harvests in both grain and cotton. They are Changshu County and Qidong County in Jiangsu Province, Tianmen County and Xinzhou County in Hubei Province, Nanhui County in Shanghai Municipality, Anqing Special District in Anhui Province, Gaocheng County in Hebei Province, Xinxiang County and Beilizhuang Brigade of Anfeng Commune in Anyang County in Henan Province, Wenshang County in Shandong Province, and others. These units actively responded to the call of the Fourth National Cotton Production Conference to seize bumper harvests in both grain and cotton, and proceeded from the actual local conditions, learned and promoted the experience of high yields in both grain and cotton, correctly handled the relationship between grain and cotton, rationally arranged grain and cotton production, grasped cotton production with one hand and grain production with the other, took active measures, promoted mutual promotion of grain and cotton production, and realized bumper harvests in both grain and cotton. Outstanding among them are Changshu County and Tianmen and Xinzhou Counties. Changshu County has a large population and little land, with an average of only 1.3 mu of arable land per person in the county. During the socialist education movement, the ideological consciousness of cadres and commune members throughout the county was significantly improved, planting cotton well for the revolution, planting grain well for the revolution. After arduous efforts, the result was the achievement of high yields in both grain and cotton. Last year, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the county was 142 jin, and the average yield of grain per mu exceeded 1,000 jin, and they sold a large amount of commodity grain and cotton to the state, making dual contributions. After cadres and commune members in Tianmen County broke the ideas of inaction and conservatism of some people in studying Chairman Mao's works, they took "learning" as the lead and "doing" as the priority, and grasped all the weak links in production and measures to increase grain and cotton production simultaneously, realizing the double increase in grain and cotton production. They became the county that sold the most cotton in the country, and at the same time increased grain production by more than 100 million jin, transforming from a grain-deficient county to a grain-surplus county.
    Among the commended units, some have transformed from low yields to high yields. They are Baitaizi Brigade of Linglongta Commune in Jianchang County, Liaoning Province, Chaoyang Special District in Liaoning Province, Zhengding County in Hebei Province, Wugong County in Shaanxi Province, and Renshou County in Sichuan Province. In the past, due to various reasons, the unit area yield of cotton in these units was relatively low. In the movement of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping, they established lofty ambitions, found out the reasons for the low yield, actively learned and adopted advanced experience, and rapidly increased the unit area yield, thereby realizing or exceeding the cotton production targets stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program" ahead of schedule. The most outstanding among them are Baitaizi Brigade and Zhengding County. Baitaizi Brigade is located in the hilly area outside the Great Wall, the land is relatively barren, the frost-free period is shorter than that of the cotton-growing areas inside the customs, and there are nine droughts in ten years. Since 1964, the commune members of this brigade have learned from Dazhai, caught up with Dazhai, and launched a tenacious struggle against unfavorable natural conditions with the revolutionary spirit of changing the world, actively reformed cotton cultivation techniques, and created a high-yield record in the northern cotton-growing area. In 1964, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in this brigade was 145 jin, an increase of 3.6 times compared with 1963; last year, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu jumped to 190 jin, and the yield of ginned cotton per mu in two production teams exceeded 200 jin. In the past two years, the grain production of this brigade has also changed from a grain-deficient team to a grain-surplus team, and a total of more than 110,000 jin of grain has been sold to the state in two years. Zhengding County is an old cotton area in the north. For a long time, the yield of ginned cotton per mu was around 40 jin. Therefore, some people believe that it is difficult to break through this level. Last year, the leading cadres of Zhengding County led the masses to study Chairman Mao's works extensively, liberated their minds, broadened their horizons, and found the gaps. The county party committee leaders went to the communes and teams to stay on the spot, worked with commune members and technicians to build models, and vigorously grasped all aspects of cotton production. Finally, they broke through the stable but unimproved cotton yield situation. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu jumped to 80 jin, an increase of 74.7% compared with the previous year, and the average grain yield per mu in the county also exceeded the targets stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program".
    Cixi County in Zhejiang Province, Batan Commune in Mianyang County in Hubei Province, Daqiao Brigade in Daqiao Commune in Ruichang County in Jiangxi Province, Fengxian County in Shanghai Municipality, Kangzhuang Commune in Gaomi County in Shandong Province, and Rengongzhuang Brigade in Xinshengdian Commune in Xiajin County are all banners of high yield and even higher yield. They were high-yield units in previous years, but they were not satisfied with high yields. With the spirit of continuous revolution, they further tapped the potential for increased production, improved cotton planting techniques, and strived for higher yields. Cixi County is one of the counties with the largest cotton planting area in China, and the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the county has exceeded 100 jin for many years. Last year, they continued to work hard to promote large-scale balanced high yields of cotton in all aspects, and the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the county rose to 150 jin, an increase of 15% compared with the previous year.
    Among the commended units are also state-owned farms such as the Manas River Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and Nantong Farm in Jiangsu. Jiangzhou Commune Mianfeng Brigade in Jiujiang County, Jiangxi Province, with dozens of educated youth as the backbone, carried out large-scale scientific experiments and conscientiously applied the cotton planting experience of the old farmers. Last year, the 450 mu of cotton fields they planted achieved an average yield of 153 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 29.3% compared with the previous year. Grain and oil crops also achieved bumper harvests, with the total grain output increasing by 23.9% compared with the previous year, and the total oil output increasing by 127%.
    Among the commended units in the new cotton-growing areas and scattered cotton-growing areas, You County in Hunan Province in the South and Pinggu County in Beijing Municipality in the North are more prominent. You County is a new cotton area, but by adopting the method of "inviting in and sending out," they conscientiously learned and promoted advanced experience, and the average yield of cotton per mu has increased several times in the past two years. The average yield of grain and cotton per mu in Pinggu County has exceeded the "Program".
    Some of the commended units have achieved disaster resistance and harvest preservation or disaster resistance and increased production after arduous struggles in the face of severe natural disasters. Among them are Xinwu Brigade of Sancang Commune in Dongtai County, Jiangsu Province, Yangtan Brigade of Yangtan Commune in Quwo County, Shanxi Province, Yuncheng County, and Suyang Brigade of Dongzhen Commune in Wenxi County. These units all suffered severe natural disasters during the cotton growing season last year. Yangtan Brigade suffered a severe drought of 120 days during the cotton growing season. With an indomitable revolutionary spirit, they tried every means to fight against the drought, and still maintained a high yield of over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and also sold a portion of commodity grain to the state. Xinwu Brigade suffered drought first and then waterlogging last year. During the critical moment of cotton growth, there were more than 40 days of overcast and rainy weather, and they also suffered from Typhoon No. 13 and four rainstorms. They used their years of experience in fighting disasters to achieve disaster resistance and production preservation, and the average yield of ginned cotton per mu still maintained a high level of over 150 jin.

    突出政治　把革命精神与科学态度结合起来
    国务院表扬一批棉花生产先进单位
    号召广大棉区社员学习他们，赶上他们，超过他们，把我国棉花生产推进到更高的水平
    新华社八日讯　一九六五年我国南北方棉区在群众性的比学赶帮超运动中，涌现出一大批棉花生产先进单位。国务院在最近召开的第五次全国棉花生产会议上，表扬了其中一批成绩突出和有一定代表性的单位，并号召广大棉区社员学习他们，赶上他们，超过他们，把我国棉花生产推进到更高的水平。
    这次受表扬的单位有南方的，有北方的；有老棉区的，有新棉区的；有集中产区的，有分散产区的，四面八方都有。其中有省市，有专区，有县，有公社，有生产大队、生产队和国营农场。他们的共同特点是，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治，正确处理政治和生产的关系，善于从实际出发，把勇于斗争的革命精神与实事求是的科学态度紧密结合起来，使阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动齐头并进，夺得了棉花高产。
    在受表扬的单位中，有许多是粮棉双丰收的红旗。它们是江苏省常熟县和启东县，湖北省天门县和新洲县，上海市南汇县，安徽省安庆专区，河北省藁城县，河南省新乡县和安阳县安丰公社北李庄大队，山东省汶上县等。这些单位积极响应第四次全国棉花生产会议提出的夺取粮棉双丰收的号召，并从当地实际情况出发，学习和推广粮棉双高产的经验，正确地处理粮棉关系，合理布局粮棉生产，一手抓棉花生产，一手抓粮食生产，采取积极的措施，使粮棉生产互相促进，实现了粮棉双丰收。它们当中突出的是常熟县和天门、新洲县。常熟县人多地少，全县平均每人只有一亩三分耕地。在社会主义教育运动中，全县干部和社员的思想觉悟显著提高，为革命种好棉花，为革命种好粮食，经过艰苦的努力，结果达到了粮棉双高产。去年，全县平均亩产皮棉一百四十二斤，平均亩产粮食超过一千斤，向国家交售了大量的商品粮棉，作出了双贡献。天门县的干部和社员在学习毛主席著作中，打破了一部分人的无所作为和故步自封思想以后，他们以学字领先，干字当头，针对生产中的薄弱环节，粮棉增产措施一齐抓，实现粮棉双增产，成为全国交售棉花最多的一个县，同时增产粮食一亿多斤，由缺粮县变为余粮县。
    在受表扬的单位中，有一些是低产变高产的。它们是辽宁省建昌县玲珑塔公社白塔子大队，辽宁省朝阳专区，河北省正定县，陕西省武功县和四川省仁寿县等。这些单位过去由于各种原因，棉花单位面积产量都比较低。在比学赶帮超运动中，他们树立起雄心大志，找出产量不高的原因，积极学习和采用先进经验，迅速提高了单位面积产量，从而提前实现或超过“全国农业发展纲要”规定的棉花生产指标。它们中成绩最突出的是白塔子大队和正定县。白塔子大队在长城外的丘陵地区，土地比较瘠薄，无霜期比关内棉区短，而且十年九旱。从一九六四年开始，这个大队的社员学大寨，赶大寨，以改天换地的革命精神，同不良的自然条件展开顽强斗争，积极改革棉花栽培技术，创造了北方棉区的高产纪录。一九六四年这个大队，平均亩产皮棉一百四十五斤，比一九六三年增长三点六倍；去年平均亩产皮棉又跃到一百九十斤，有两个生产队亩产皮棉超过二百斤。两年来，这个大队的粮食生产也由缺粮队变为余粮队，两年共向国家出售十一万多斤粮食。正定县是北方的一个老棉区，在很长时间里，皮棉亩产量在四十斤上下。因此，有些人便认为很难突破这个水平。去年，正定县的领导干部带动群众大学毛主席著作，解放了思想，开阔了眼界，找出了差距。县委领导干部分头到社队蹲点，和社员、技术人员一起搞样板，狠抓棉花生产的各个环节，终于突破了棉花产量稳而不进的局面，平均亩产皮棉一跃达到八十斤，比前年提高百分之七十四点七，全县粮食平均亩产量也超过了“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标。
    浙江省慈溪县，湖北省沔阳县八潭公社，江西省瑞昌县大桥公社大桥大队，上海市奉贤县，山东省高密县康庄公社和夏津县新盛店公社任宫庄大队等，都是高产再高产的旗帜。他们在前些年就是高产单位，但是他们不因高产而满足，以不断革命的精神，进一步挖掘增产潜力，改进植棉技术，力争高产更高产。慈溪县是我国植棉面积最大的县之一，已经连续多年全县平均亩产皮棉超过百斤。去年，他们继续努力，从各方面促进棉花大面积平衡高产，全县皮棉平均亩产又上升到一百五十斤，比前一年增长百分之十五。
    受表扬的单位中，还有新疆生产建设兵团玛纳斯河垦区、江苏南通农场等国营农场。以几十名知识青年为骨干的江西省九江县江洲公社棉丰大队，大搞科学实验，认真运用老农的植棉经验，去年种植的四百五十亩棉田，平均亩产皮棉达到一百五十三斤，比前年增产百分之二十九点三，粮食、油料作物也获得丰收，粮食总产量比上一年增长百分之二十三点九，油脂总产量增长百分之一百二十七。
    在新棉区和分散产棉区受表扬的单位中，以南方的湖南省攸县和北方的北京市平谷县比较突出。攸县是个新棉区，但采用“请进来，派出去”的办法，认真学习和推广先进经验，两年来棉花平均亩产增长了几倍。平谷县的粮棉平均亩产都超过“纲要”。
    有一些受表扬的单位，是在遭受严重自然灾害的情况下，经过艰巨的斗争，实现抗灾保收或抗灾增产的。其中有江苏省东台县三仓公社新五大队，山西省曲沃县杨谈公社杨谈大队、运城县和闻喜县东镇公社涑阳大队等。这些单位去年在棉花生长期间，都遭受了严重的自然灾害。杨谈大队在棉花生长期间，遭受一百二十天的特大旱灾，他们以坚韧不拔的革命精神，千方百计地同干旱作斗争，仍然保持了亩产皮棉超百斤的高产量，还向国家交售了一部分商品粮。新五大队去年先旱后涝，在棉花生长的关键时刻，阴雨四十多天，还遭受十三号台风和四次暴雨袭击，他们运用多年来抗灾斗争的经验，做到了抗灾保产，平均亩产皮棉仍保持一百五十多斤的高水平。
