　　Building a Bridge of Friendship in the Hearts of the Burmese People
　　——The Days of Chinese Experts Helping Build the Kunglong Steel Cable Suspension Bridge in Burma
    Last year, it was already December, but in Kunglong, Burma, the autumn was still crisp and the leaves were green. The Chinese experts who helped Burma build the Kunglong Steel Cable Suspension Bridge completed the construction task three months ahead of schedule and were preparing to return home. On the day of their departure, groups of Burmese workers and local residents rushed to the Chinese experts' residence early in the morning to see them off, bringing various gifts to express their deep feelings. The Chinese experts thanked them for their kindness and politely declined their gifts. The time of parting arrived, and many people's eyes were red, and some were even sobbing. Originally, everyone had so much to say! But at this time, what else could be said? The magnificent bridge towering over the Salween River, symbolizing the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people, had already replaced their words...
    During the days when the Chinese experts worked in Burma, they left behind many tales of friendship.
    The Chinese experts treated the Burmese workers and technicians with brotherly affection. The experts guided a large number of Burmese construction workers, some experts even had to guide dozens of people. Despite the intense and tiring work, the Chinese experts always taught the Burmese construction workers with seriousness and enthusiasm. The Burmese workers said with emotion, "The Chinese experts are so good! They guide us in learning technology with patience and kindness." During construction, many Chinese experts took the initiative to give their labor protection supplies such as gloves to their Burmese worker brothers. Not only that, but the Chinese experts also cared for their Burmese worker brothers in their lives. On the Mid-Autumn Festival evening the year before last, each Chinese expert received some mooncakes. One expert remembered that a Burmese worker who worked with him was sick, so he gave his share of mooncakes to him. This worker was moved by the deep affection of the Chinese expert and, on one occasion when he went home to Mandalay to visit his relatives, he specially selected a very beautiful "sarong" (Burmese clothing) for this expert. There was a very young Burmese worker on the construction site, and the Chinese experts always treated him like a younger brother and cared for him very much. Once, he was given two oranges. This "little brother" couldn't bear to eat them and put the oranges in his pocket, often taking them out and saying to others, "These were given to me by the Chinese experts."
    The Chinese experts approached the construction of the Kunglong Bridge with an extremely responsible attitude, always thinking of the Burmese people. The originally designed suspension bridge had two rows of steel structure railings on both the north and south banks. During the construction process, it was discovered that there was a mountain wall on the north bank, with a ditch under the wall. The Chinese experts, with the consent of the Burmese engineers, took the initiative to modify the design and removed the two rows of thirty-meter-long railings on the north bank. This not only did not detract from the beauty and effectiveness, but also saved a portion of the investment.
    In order to make the Kunglong Bridge open to traffic as soon as possible, the Chinese experts often worked overtime. One expert worked in Burma for half a year and only rested for three Sundays. During the peak of construction, one night, dozens of Chinese experts transported one hundred and dozens of cubic meters of stone from more than half a kilometer away to the Kunglong Bridgehead. The Burmese engineers, after learning about this, called on the workers to learn from the Chinese experts. The next night, the Burmese workers also worked overtime to transport stones. It was precisely because of the hard work of the Burmese workers, technicians, and Chinese experts that the Kunglong Bridge was completed three months ahead of schedule.
    On the day of the opening, an elderly farmer who had come from a nearby village said, "Such a big bridge was built in one and a half years with the help of Chinese experts. It would take several years for others to do it." The old man's words were based on fact. A few years ago, more than sixty Indians spent two years building two steel cables for ferry ropes and pouring dozens of cubic meters of concrete in a place two hundred meters away from the current Kunglong Bridge. Such a small project took two years to complete. The Kunglong Bridge, not to mention anything else, simply the concrete poured is six thousand and several hundred cubic meters!
    The Chinese experts have already left Burma and returned home. However, in Burma, they not only helped build a steel cable suspension bridge, but also built a bridge of friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people in the hearts of the Burmese people.

　　在缅甸人民心里架起了友谊之桥
　　——中国专家在缅甸帮助建设滚弄钢索吊桥的日子里
    去年，时节已经是十二月了，在缅甸滚弄地方却还是秋高气爽，枝青叶绿。帮助缅甸建设滚弄钢索吊桥的中国专家们提前三个月完成了建设任务，准备回国了。临行的一天，成群结队的缅甸工人和当地的居民大清早就赶到中国专家的住宿地来送行，并且带着各种各样的礼物向中国专家表示他们的依依之情。中国专家们对他们的盛情，表示感谢，婉言辞谢了他们的礼物。分别的时候到来了，很多人的眼圈红了，有些人甚至泣不成声。本来，大家心里有多少话要说啊！可是在这个时候，还能说些什么呢？雄伟地耸立在萨尔温江上的大桥，象征着中缅两国人民的友谊，已经替代了彼此的言语……
    中国专家在缅甸工作的日子里，留下了很多友谊的佳话。
    中国专家对缅甸工人和技术人员怀着兄弟般的感情。专家们指导缅甸施工人员的人数较多，有的专家一个人甚至要指导几十人。尽管工作十分紧张和劳累，但是中国专家们总是认真而热情地对缅甸施工人员传授技术。缅甸工人感动地说：“中国专家真好！指导我们学习技术耐心、和气。”在施工中，很多中国专家主动将手套之类的劳动保护用品让给缅甸工人弟兄用。不但如此，中国专家在生活上也做到了和缅甸的工人兄弟互相关心。前年中秋节晚上，中国专家每人分了些月饼。有一位专家想起同他一起工作的一位缅甸工人正在生病，就把自己的一份月饼送给他。这位工人被中国专家的深情厚意所感动，一次去曼德勒探亲，特意给这位专家选购了一条十分好看的“沙笼”（缅服）。工地上有一位年纪很小的缅甸工人，中国专家一直把他当小弟弟看待，对他十分关怀。有一次，给了他两个橘子。这个“小弟弟”舍不得吃，把橘子放在口袋里，经常拿出来对旁人说：“这是中国专家送我的。”
    中国专家对滚弄桥的建设，抱着极为负责的态度，处处为缅甸人民着想。原先设计的吊桥，北岸与南岸一样有两排钢结构栏杆。施工过程中，发现北岸有山壁，壁下有水沟。中国专家就征得缅甸工程师的同意，主动修改了设计，把北岸两排三十米长的栏杆去掉了。这样，既无损美观和效用，又节省了一部分投资。
    中国专家为了使滚弄桥早日通车，经常加班加点工作。有一位专家在缅甸工作半年，只休息了三个星期日。施工高潮期间，有一天晚上，几十名中国专家从一里多远的地方将一百几十方石块运到了滚弄桥头。缅甸工程师知道后，号召工人向中国专家学习。第二天晚上，缅甸工人也加班运石块。正是由于缅甸工人、技术人员和中国专家的紧张劳动，使得滚弄大桥提前三个月建成。
    在通车那天，从附近乡下赶来的一位老年农民说：“这么大的桥在中国专家帮助下，一年半就建成了。换别人，总得搞几年。”这位老人的话是有根据的。几年前，六十多名印度人在离现今滚弄桥两百多米远的地方，搞了两条摆渡拴缆绳用的钢索，灌了几十立方混凝土，这样一点小工程还花了两年的时间才完成。眼下滚弄大桥不说别的，单是灌的混凝土就有六千几百立方！
    中国专家已经离开缅甸回国了。但是，他们在缅甸不仅是帮助建设了一座钢索吊桥，而且还在缅甸人民心里架起了一座中缅人民友谊之桥。
