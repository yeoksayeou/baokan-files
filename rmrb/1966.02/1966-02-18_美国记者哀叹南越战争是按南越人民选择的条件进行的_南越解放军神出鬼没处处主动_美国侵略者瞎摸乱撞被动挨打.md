    Xinhua News Agency, February 16th - United Press reporter John Wheeler, in a commentary from Saigon on the 14th, admitted that "It often happens in South Vietnam that major battles between the Communists (referring to the South Vietnam Liberation Army) and the Allies (referring to the U.S. aggressor troops and their puppet troops) are almost always conducted on the terms chosen by the Communists."

    This U.S. reporter, in his commentary, revealed the difficult situation the U.S. aggressor troops found themselves in, passively taking a beating in the sea of the people's war in South Vietnam. He used the failure of the "Operation Masher" in the Bong Son area as an example, saying that "A recent example of this occurred in the central coastal region about three hundred miles (four hundred eighty kilometers) north of Saigon, where nearly two divisions of the Allied forces—mostly American—converged on a Communist stronghold from the north and south.

    The U.S. First Cavalry Division and the Vietnamese Airborne Division (referring to the South Vietnamese puppet troops) coming from the south encountered fierce resistance near Bong Son. After intense fighting, the Viet Cong troops suddenly broke contact and vanished without a trace.

    "South Vietnamese had reported that two Communist regiments had entrenched themselves near Bong Son in January. It appears that the Communists either anticipated or were informed of the Allied forces' impending joint operation, and therefore wanted to engage in a contest.

      "When the Communists had fought enough, they withdrew to the mountains to the west—where no Allied troops were deployed, nor were any troops sent to pursue them.

      "The (U.S.) Marines coming from the north did not encounter any significant resistance. The Viet Cong in this area also withdrew to the safe zone to the west.

      "Thus, these two U.S. forces pounced on the An Lao Valley, which the Communists had controlled for nearly twenty years. There were indications that this was the primary target of this operation. Special Forces reconnaissance teams were hit hard while probing in this area. When the main U.S. force finally arrived, the enemy was already gone."

    This reporter complained in his commentary that "Neither the Americans nor the South Vietnamese can put together an effective intelligence network to report the Viet Cong's plans in advance."

    The commentary said, "In most cases, when Allied forces launch an offensive, the Communists can choose to stand and fight, or they can disperse into small groups, disappearing into the jungle along camouflaged trails that only they know."

      "Although the Allied forces virtually monopolize air power and artillery, they often cannot catch the (Liberation Army's) rearguard. The Communists withdrew through friendly areas familiar to them. The advancing troops are in hostile territory, at constant risk of ambush. Allied forces often have to pass through minefields and traps, which further slows their advance."

### 美国记者哀叹南越战争是按南越人民选择的条件进行的  南越解放军神出鬼没处处主动  美国侵略者瞎摸乱撞被动挨打

    美国记者哀叹南越战争是按南越人民选择的条件进行的
    南越解放军神出鬼没处处主动  美国侵略者瞎摸乱撞被动挨打
    新华社十六日讯　美联社记者约翰·惠勒十四日从西贡发出的一篇述评承认，“在南越经常重演这样的事情：共军（按指越南南方解放军）和盟军（按指美国侵略军及其仆从军）之间的主要战斗，几乎总是按照共产党人选择的条件进行的”。
    这个美国记者在述评中透露了美国侵略军在越南南方人民战争的海洋里被动挨打的困难处境。他以蓬山地区的“捣碎机攻势”的失败为例说，“说明这种情况的一个最近的例子发生在西贡北部大约三百英里（四百八十公里）的中部沿海地区，那里的盟军将近两师——大多数是美军——从北面和南面向共产党的一个据点合拢。
    从南面开来的美国第一骑兵师和越南空降部队（按指南越伪军）在蓬山附近遭遇到顽强的抵抗。经过激烈战斗后，越共军队突然停止接触，变得无影无踪。
    “南越人曾报告说，共产党有两团人一月间在蓬山附近掘壕踞守，看来共产党人对于盟军这次即将采取的联合行动不是预先估计到就是知情的，因此要较量一番。
      “当共产党人打够了，他们就开到西边的山里——那里没有部署任何盟军，也没有派遣军队去追击他们。
      “从北面下来的（美国）海军陆战队没有遇到任何重大的抵抗。这个地区里的越共也撤到西边安全地带去了。
      “于是这两支美军向共产党统治了将近二十年的安老河谷猛扑。有迹象表明这是这次行动的主要目标。特种部队的侦察队在这一地区刺探时遭到狠狠打击。当美军主力最后开到的时候，敌人已经不见了。”
    这个记者在述评中抱怨“不论是美国人还是南越人都不能拼成一个有效的谍报网来预先报告越共的计划。”
    述评说，“在大多数情况下，当盟军发动攻势的时候，共产党可以选择坚持战斗，也可以分散成小股，沿着只有他们才知道的伪装小道，消失在丛林中。”
      “盟军虽然实际上独占空中力量和大炮，但是往往抓不着（解放军）后卫部队。共产党人通过他们所熟悉的友好地区撤走了。进击部队是在敌对的地区，随时都有遭到伏击的危险。盟军往往必须穿过布雷区和陷阱，这样，他们的行动就更加缓慢了。”
