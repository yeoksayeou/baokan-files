    No "Old Buddha's Eyeballs" Are Untouchable
    Some people at the Shenyang Paint Factory used to regard foreign technical data as "Old Buddha's eyeballs," untouchable. They dared not even touch the technical formulas of the products. During the national paint competition in 1964, six varieties were in the middle to lower ranks. However, after they established lofty ambitions, broke away from superstition, and conducted serious analysis and comparison, as well as repeated research and experiments, they reformed the product formulas, which greatly improved the products on the original basis, and four varieties were rated as first-class.
    A short commentary published in the *Shenyang Evening News* said: Regarding foreign technical data as "Old Buddha's eyeballs" and not daring to cross the line is a metaphysical viewpoint, a viewpoint of stagnation, a viewpoint of inaction. It does not conform to the laws of development of things. Everything is constantly developing and changing, and so is foreign technical data. Absolutely unchanging, absolutely untouchable and unmodifiable things do not exist. Chairman Mao said: "Communists must ask 'why' about everything, and think carefully through their own minds to consider whether it conforms to reality and whether it is truly reasonable. Absolutely should not blindly follow, and absolutely should not advocate slavishness." When dealing with foreign technical data, we should also follow Chairman Mao's teachings to think and analyze. We must see if it is scientific, advanced, and conforms to China's actual situation. If it is not scientific, not advanced, and does not conform to our specific situation, even if such foreign technical data is "Old Buddha's eyeballs," we must poke it. If we don't poke it, it does not conform to materialist dialectics. If we don't poke it, things cannot move forward. If we don't poke it, new levels cannot emerge.
    We advocate daring to poke "Old Buddha's eyeballs," but not blindly. It is necessary to conduct analysis and research. For those technologies that come from practice and have been proven to be scientific and advanced in practice, whether they are Chinese or foreign, we will not only not poke them, but also actively adopt them.

### 没有捅不得的“老佛爷眼珠”

    没有捅不得的“老佛爷眼珠”
    沈阳油漆厂有些人过去把外国的技术资料看成是“老佛爷眼珠”，捅不得，对产品的技术配方动也不敢动。一九六四年全国油漆评比时，六个品种都是中下游。但当他们树立了雄心壮志，破除了迷信，进行了认真的分析对比和反复研究试验以后，改革了产品配方，使得产品在原基础上大大提高，有四个品种被评为第一流。
    《沈阳晚报》发表短评说：把外国的技术资料看做是“老佛爷眼珠”，不敢跨越雷池一步，这是形而上学观点，是停止的论点，无所作为的论点，它不符合事物发展的规律。任何事物都是在不断发展变化的，外国的技术资料也是这样。绝对不变，绝对不能动、不能改的事物是不存在的。毛主席说：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”对待外国的技术资料，也应当按照毛主席的教导，去思考，去分析。要看它是不是科学，是不是先进，是不是符合我国的实际情况。如果它不是科学的，不是先进的，不符合我们的具体情况，这样的外国技术资料，即便是“老佛爷眼珠”，我们也要捅，不捅，就不符合唯物辩证法，不捅，事物就不能向前发展，不捅，就出不来新水平。
    我们提倡敢捅“老佛爷眼珠”，并不是盲目乱捅，是要经过分析研究，对于那些从实践中来，而又在实践中证明是科学的、先进的技术，不论是中国的还是外国的我们不仅不捅，并且要积极采用。
