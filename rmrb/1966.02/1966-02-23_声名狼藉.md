    Infamous Reputation
    The California Democratic Committee held a representative meeting on the 20th. During his speech, California Governor Brown described Johnson as a peace-loving citizen of the United States. The entire venue immediately erupted in booing and jeering, and about 200 representatives even walked out of the meeting in protest. When the governor asked the meeting to support his re-election, the majority of the representatives did not vote in favor.
    
    Whoever praises Johnson is doomed. If it's like this even within Johnson's own party, then one can imagine how infamous Johnson is among the American people.

    声名狼藉
    美国加利福尼亚州民主党委员会在二十日举行代表会议。加利福尼亚州州长布朗在讲话中把约翰逊说成是美国爱好和平的公民。整个会场马上发出一片哄闹和嘲笑声，约有二百名代表甚至退出了会场表示抗议。当这个州长要求会议支持他重新当选时，大多数代表没有投赞成票。
    谁为约翰逊捧场谁就要倒霉，在约翰逊自己的党内尚且如此，那末，约翰逊在美国人民中怎样声名狼藉更是可想而知了。
