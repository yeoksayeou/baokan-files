　　Continuously Crushing the "Sweeps" of the American Aggressor Troops with Counter-"Sweeps"
　　South Vietnamese Army and People Annihilate Over 6,500 Enemy Troops in One Month
　　Continue to Vigorously Strike American Troops and Their Accomplice Armies in the Bong Son and Saigon Areas
    Editor's Note: In the past month, the American aggressor troops have reorganized their forces and launched multi-pronged offensives, vainly attempting to show off their strength on the South Vietnamese battlefield. The result is still a disastrous defeat. The South Vietnamese army and people do not have any new weapons; they still rely on their old magic weapon—people's war, either attacking, defending, ambushing, or encircling and annihilating, beating the enemy to a pulp. The heroic South Vietnamese fought valiantly for a month and achieved brilliant results, giving the American aggressors' "sweep" and "pacification" conspiracies a heavy blow. After struggling for a while, the predicament of the American aggressors being passively beaten has not improved at all. This further proves that American imperialism is indeed unable to cope with people's war.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said during our Third Revolutionary Civil War that when the enemy attacks, we eliminate him, and he will feel comfortable. Eliminate a little, feel a little comfortable; eliminate a lot, feel a lot more comfortable; eliminate completely, feel completely comfortable. In South Vietnam, in the past month, the American aggressor troops and their puppet armies have been eliminated by more than 6,500, it seems that the American aggressors are a little more comfortable than before. If this continues, the American aggressors will definitely be completely comfortable.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 23rd (via South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency): Within a month, up to February 9th, the army and people of South Vietnam annihilated a total of more than 6,500 American and puppet troops.
    The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces also shot down, damaged, and destroyed 276 aircraft of various types on the ground, destroyed and severely damaged 86 military vehicles of various types, and destroyed three 105mm howitzers.
    Guerrillas in the northern part of Cu Chi District, Gia Dinh Province, frustrated a major "sweep" launched by thousands of American and puppet troops in twelve days, up to January 19th. They killed 1,438 American aggressor troops, wounded 206 American and Australian troops, shot down and damaged 84 aircraft, destroyed and severely damaged 77 military vehicles, and destroyed two 105mm howitzers.
    In southern Cu Chi, in two weeks up to February 5th, the guerrillas frustrated the enemy's second "sweep," killing and wounding 933 American aggressors, shooting down and damaging six aircraft, burning and damaging six military vehicles, and destroying one 105mm howitzer.
    The news agency said that in the eleven days up to February 7th, the armed forces of Duc Pho District, Quang Ngai Province, fiercely resisted an offensive by more than one regiment of American and puppet troops, annihilating 539 enemy troops, including 409 American aggressors, shooting down 15 aircraft, and damaging nine.
    In Thu Dau Mot Province, on the night of January 30th, the Liberation Army bombarded the Phu Loi airfield, the base of the American 1st Infantry Division, with mortars, killing and wounding more than 300 American aggressor troops, destroying 52 helicopters and three armored vehicles.
    The report said that in the 22 days up to February 9th, the Liberation Army of Tuy Hoa District, Phu Yen Province, completely defeated the "sweep" by American and accomplice troops to plunder rice, annihilating 1,100 enemy troops, most of whom were American aggressors.
    In the five days up to January 13th, the Liberation Army routed the South Korean accomplice troops who were conducting a "sweep" in nine villages in Binh Dinh Province, eliminating 572 of them. In the eight days up to February 4th, the army and people in the Bong Son area of this province eliminated 1,500 of the 15,000 aggressor troops of the American 1st Cavalry Division and accomplice troops who were conducting a "sweep" in this area.
    The Liberation Army also destroyed more than 70 enemy aircraft and damaged 40.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: Saigon Dispatch: In the past few days, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have continued to fiercely strike the American aggressor troops and their accomplice armies on the two battlefields south of Bong Son and north of Saigon, inflicting heavy casualties on them.
    According to Western news agencies, the Liberation Army units fighting in the area south of Bong Son, which the American 1st Cavalry Division calls the "Little Iron Triangle," displayed a spirit of heroic and tenacious combat, holding onto this jungle-covered high ground, which is only three or four hundred meters wide, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy who attempted to occupy this area. United Press International reported on February 22nd that the Liberation Army units "have kept the cavalry from crossing the line at this triangular fortress for four days," and that "the Viet Cong's charges and the fierce fire from deep fortifications have prevented the American troops from advancing." The frenzied enemy, helpless, dispatched B-52 bombers to carry out indiscriminate bombing of this small iron position. It was not until February 22nd that the enemy ventured to send several battalions of troops, timidly groping their way in. However, these American aggressors only found bomb fragments all over the ground, and the Liberation Army had already proactively moved after killing a large number of enemies.
    According to reports, on February 22nd, the mobile and flexible Liberation Army unexpectedly appeared on Highway 1, which leads from Bong Son to Phu Cat, and fiercely ambushed a group of puppet troops who were cooperating with the 1st Cavalry Division, inflicting casualties on the enemy. The next day, the Liberation Army grabbed a company of the 1st Cavalry Division and gave it a severe beating.
    According to reports, in Thu Dau Mot Province, starting from February 21st, the American aggressors dispatched several thousand aggressor troops from the 1st Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division, along with Australian and New Zealand accomplice troops and South Vietnamese puppet troops, to launch a large-scale "sweep" against an area 50 kilometers north of Saigon. However, as soon as these American aggressor troops and their accomplice armies set foot on this liberated area, they found themselves trapped in the dragnet set by the people of South Vietnam. The ground was covered with mines that could be triggered at any moment, and snipers fired fierce and accurate shots from all directions, scaring the American aggressors out of their wits, huddling together, and daring not to move forward.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 23rd (via South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency): From January 31st to February 12th, the army and people of the South Vietnamese provinces of Tan An, Gia Dinh, Tra Vinh, and Thu Dau Mot successively frustrated many large-scale "sweeps" by American and puppet troops, and also took the initiative to attack, annihilating a total of more than 800 enemy troops, including one American major and one puppet major, shooting down six enemy aircraft, and destroying and damaging ten enemy vehicles.
    On February 11th, the Tan An Provincial Liberation Armed Forces took the initiative to intercept five battalions of the puppet 25th Division and the Security Forces and Civil Guard, etc., which were conducting a large-scale "sweep" against Nhat Ninh and Tay Tan Phuoc communes, killing and wounding more than 200 enemies, including seven American troops, one puppet major, and three puppet lieutenants, shooting down three helicopters, sinking one landing craft, and seizing a large number of weapons.
    The guerrillas of Cu Chi District, Gia Dinh Province, continuously intercepted the invading enemy troops day and night for six days from February 7th to 12th, thoroughly frustrating the enemy's "sweep" against Trung Lap Ha, Trung Lap Thuong, Duc Hiep, and Tan Thong Hoi communes, eliminating 193 enemies, destroying and damaging four enemy military vehicles, and seizing a batch of weapons.
    The Nha Be District guerrillas of this province also continuously intercepted the enemy's four "sweeps" against Da Phuoc and Qui Duc communes from January 31st to February 10th, killing and wounding 109 enemies, including one American major who lost his life.
    On January 31st, the Tra Vinh Provincial Liberation Armed Forces fiercely blocked more than 2,000 puppet troops who came to "sweep" in Hieu Thanh village, Hieu Kinh commune, and An Truong commune. In this battle, the Liberation Armed Forces killed and wounded more than 250 enemies and damaged two M-113 amphibious armored vehicles.
    In Thu Dau Mot Province, from February 1st to 8th, the guerrillas continuously attacked the enemy on Highway 13. They killed and wounded 36 American aggressor troops and many puppet troops, destroyed four enemy vehicles, and shot down two helicopters.
    During this period, the Ben Cat District guerrillas of this province also continuously intercepted the American aggressor troops who were conducting a "sweep" against Lai Hung commune, killing more than 40 people. (Attached image)

　　连续以反“扫荡”粉碎美国侵略军的“扫荡”
　　南越军民一个月内歼敌六千五百多名
　　在蓬山和西贡等地区继续痛击美军及其帮凶军
    编者按　近一个月来，美国侵略军重整旗鼓，集中兵力，发动了多路攻势，妄图在南越战场上露一手，结果是照样遭到了惨重的失败。越南南方军民并没有什么新武器，还是靠他们的老法宝——人民战争，或攻，或守，或袭击，或围歼，把敌人打得个落花流水。南越英雄奋战一月，取得了辉煌战果，给了美国侵略者的“扫荡”、“绥靖”阴谋以沉重的打击。美国侵略者挣扎了一阵，它那被动挨打的狼狈处境一点也没有得到改善。这更加证明了，美帝国主义的确无法对付人民战争。
    毛泽东同志在我国第三次国内革命战争期间说过，敌人来进攻，我们把他消灭了，他就舒服了。消灭一点，舒服一点；消灭得多，舒服得多；彻底消灭，彻底舒服。在南越，最近一个月来，美国侵略军及其仆从军又被消灭了六千五百多，看来美国侵略者又比过去舒服了一点。继续这样下去，美国侵略者是一定会彻底舒服的。
    新华社河内二十三日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方军民在到二月九日为止的一个月之内共歼灭美军和仆从军六千五百多人。
    越南南方解放武装力量还击落、击伤和在地面上击毁各种飞机二百七十六架，炸毁和严重炸伤各种军车八十六辆，击毁一零五毫米大炮三门。
    嘉定省古芝县北部的游击队在到一月十九日为止的十二天中，粉碎了数千名美军和仆从军发动的一次大“扫荡”。他们打死美国侵略军一千四百三十八名，打伤美军和澳大利亚军二百零六人，击落和击伤飞机八十四架，炸毁和严重炸伤军车七十七辆，击毁一零五毫米大炮两门。
    在古芝南部，在到二月五日为止的两星期内，游击队粉碎了敌人的第二次“扫荡”，打死打伤美国侵略者九百三十三人，击落和击伤飞机六架，烧毁和击伤军车六辆，击毁一零五毫米大炮一门。
    这家通讯社说，在到二月七日为止的十一天中，广义省德普县的武装力量猛烈抗击了美军和仆从军一个团以上兵力的进攻，歼灭敌军五百三十九人，其中有美国侵略者四百零九名，击落飞机十五架，击伤九架。
    在土龙木省，一月三十日夜里，解放军用迫击炮轰击了美国第一步兵师的基地富利机场，打死、打伤美国侵略军三百多名，击毁直升飞机五十二架和装甲车三辆。
    报道说，在到二月九日为止的二十二天内，富安省绥和县的解放军彻底打败了美军和帮凶军的掠夺大米的“扫荡”，歼灭一千一百名敌军，其中大部分是美国侵略者。
    在到一月十三日为止的五天内，解放军击溃了在平定省九个乡进行“扫荡”的南朝鲜帮凶军，消灭其中五百七十二名。在到二月四日为止的八天内，这个省的蓬山地区的军民消灭了在这一地区进行“扫荡”的美国第一骑兵师和帮凶军一万五千名侵略军中的一千五百人。
    解放军还击毁敌机七十多架，击伤四十架。
    新华社二十三日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量最近几天在蓬山以南和西贡以北的两个战场上，继续狠狠打击美国侵略军及其帮凶军，使他们遭到惨重伤亡。
    据西方通讯社报道，战斗在蓬山南面被美国第一骑兵师称为“小铁三角”地区的解放军部队，发扬英勇顽强的作战精神，坚守着这个宽广不过三四百米的丛林密布的高地，使企图侵占这个地区的敌人遭到惨重伤亡，死伤累累。合众国际社二十二日报道说，解放军部队“四天来在这个三角形堡垒使骑兵不能越雷池一步”，“越共的冲锋和从纵深工事发出的猛烈火力曾使美军无法前进”。疯狂的敌人无可奈何，出动了B—52轰炸机对这块小小的钢铁阵地进行狂轰滥炸。直到二十二日，敌人才冒险派了几个营的兵力，胆战心惊地摸进去。但是，这些美国侵略者在那里只找到满地的炸弹片，解放军在大量杀伤敌人后早已主动转移了。
    据报道，二十二日，机动灵活的解放军又出敌不意地在蓬山通往符吉的一号公路上出现，猛烈地伏击了协同骑一师作战的一股伪军，使敌人遭到伤亡。次日，解放军又揪住骑一师的一个连，给了它一顿痛打。
    据报道，在土龙木省，从二十一日起，美国侵略者出动了第一步兵师和第二十五步兵师的数千名侵略军，伙同澳大利亚和新西兰帮凶军以及南越伪军，向西贡以北五十公里的一个地区发动大规模“扫荡”。但是，当这些美国侵略军及其帮凶军一踏上这片解放区土地，他们就发现自己已经落入了越南南方人民给他们设下的天罗地网。遍地是一触即发的地雷，狙击手从四面八方发出又猛又准的冷枪，吓得美国侵略者魂飞魄散，龟缩在一起，不敢前进一步。
    据新华社河内二十三日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方新安、嘉定、茶荣、土龙木等省军民，在一月三十一日到二月十二日期间，接连挫败美伪军多次大规模“扫荡”，并且主动出击，共歼灭敌军八百多人，其中有美军和伪军少校各一名，击落敌机六架，击毁击伤敌车十辆。
    新安省解放武装力量十一日主动截击伪军第二十五师五个营和保安队、民卫队等对日宁乡和西新福乡进行的大“扫荡”，共打死打伤敌人二百多名，包括美军七名、伪少校一名和伪尉官三名，打落直升飞机三架，打沉登陆艇一艘，缴获大批武器。
    嘉定省古芝县游击队在二月七日到十二日的六天中，不分昼夜地连续截击来犯敌军，彻底挫败了敌人对中立下、中立上、德协、新通会等乡的“扫荡”，歼灭敌人一百九十三名，击毁击伤敌军用车四辆，缴获一批武器。
    这个省芽?县游击队，在一月三十一日到二月十日期间也连续截击了敌人对多福乡和归德乡的四次“扫荡”，打死打伤一百零九名敌人，其中有一名美军少校丧命。
    茶荣省解放武装力量于一月三十一日，分别在孝诚乡孝京村和安张乡猛烈阻击前来“扫荡”的两千多名伪军。在这次战斗中，解放武装力量共打死打伤二百五十多名敌人，击伤M—113型两栖装甲车两辆。
    在土龙木省，二月一日到八日期间，游击队接连在十三号公路上打击敌人。打死打伤美国侵略军三十六名和伪军多名，摧毁敌军车四辆，打落直升飞机两架。
    在这期间，这个省边葛县游击队也连续截击对来兴乡进行“扫荡”的美国侵略军，打死四十多名。（附图片）
