　　According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 23rd, at the recent National Plant Protection Machinery Work Conference held in Nanjing, personnel from relevant departments from various regions exchanged experiences in manufacturing pesticide sprayers to vigorously support agricultural production.
    The information provided at the meeting indicated that in recent years, industrial departments in various regions have provided a large number of sprayers (dusters) suitable for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests of various crops to rural areas. The number of product varieties has increased from three or four in previous years to more than twenty, and the product quality has also improved significantly, effectively enhancing the ability of various regions to prevent and control crop diseases and insect pests.
    Various regions have paid particular attention to the production of semi-mechanized manual sprayers (dusters). The "Golden Bee-12 Type Knapsack Sprayer" designed and manufactured by the Jinhua Agricultural Machinery Factory in Zhejiang is very popular among farmers. This sprayer can be carried on the back like a backpack, spraying medicine and pumping air at the same time, making it very convenient to use. This sprayer has a wide range of adaptability, and can be used in plains, hilly areas, and mountainous areas to prevent and control crop diseases and insect pests, or for sanitary and epidemic prevention in ponds and warehouses.
    The "WB-15 Type Knapsack Sprayer" designed and manufactured by the Shanghai Agricultural Pharmaceutical Machinery Factory adopts a new structure. The liquid pump and air chamber of this sprayer are installed outside the medicine tank, which can avoid corrosion of the medicine and extend the service life. The pumping handle of this sprayer can be switched from one side of the medicine tank to the other for alternating pumping with both hands.
    Motorized sprayers have also developed from scratch in recent years. At present, a total of seven types have been successfully trial-produced and put into production. The "Nanjing 2604 Long-Range Sprayer," which is suitable for paddy field areas, can absorb water on the spot, automatically mix medicines, and spray remotely. As long as there is two inches of shallow water in the field, the machine can absorb water and work normally. This sprayer has a range of fifteen meters. When spraying medicine on a thirty-meter-wide field, people and machines do not need to enter the field. It has a higher control effect on rice stem borers and other insect pests.
    Metallurgical and chemical departments have also successfully trial-produced "plastic composite steel plates" and "609 ring hydrogen anti-corrosion paint" for the plant protection machinery industry. The corrosion resistance of these two new materials is much better than the shellac coatings used in the past, providing favorable conditions for further improving the quality of plant protection machinery. These two new materials have begun to be used on some products.
    These new types of plant protection machinery are designed and trial-produced successfully by Chinese farmers, scientific and technical personnel, and industrial enterprise employees, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit, breaking down foreign frameworks, and based on China's actual conditions. When the technical personnel of the Nanjing Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute began to design the "Nanjing 2604 Long-Range Sprayer," they had neither a prototype nor technical data. They went deep into rural areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi to investigate and study, absorbing useful experiences from the masses of farmers, and finally designed a long-range sprayer welcomed by farmers. The Jinhua Agricultural Machinery Factory in Zhejiang went deep into the countryside, redesigned according to the requirements of the farmers, and then took the trial-produced prototype back to the countryside to ask the farmers to use it and solicit opinions for repeated improvements. As a result, the "Golden Bee-12 Type Knapsack Sprayer" was successfully trial-produced.

　　从实践中找办法　从群众中找经验
　　各地制成大批新型农药喷雾器械
　　全国植物保护机械工作会议交流经验
    据新华社南京二十三日电　最近在南京举行的全国植物保护机械工作会议上，来自各地有关部门的人员交流了制造农药喷雾器械大力支援农业生产的经验。
    会议提供的情况表明，近几年来各地工业部门为农村提供了大量的适用于防治各种农作物病虫害的喷雾（粉）器，产品品种由前几年的三四种发展到二十多种，产品质量也显著提高，有效地增强了各地防治农作物病虫害的能力。
    各地特别重视半机械化的手动喷雾（粉）器的生产。浙江金华农业机械厂设计制造的“金蜂—12型背负式喷雾器”，很受农民欢迎。这种喷雾器可以象背包一样背在身上，一边喷药，一边打气，使用非常方便。这种喷雾器适应性比较广，无论是在平原地区、丘陵山区防治农作物病虫害，或者是在池塘、仓库进行卫生防疫，都能使用。
    上海农业药械厂设计制造的“ＷＢ—15型背负式喷雾器”采用了新的结构。这种喷雾器的液泵和气室都装在药箱外面，可以避免药物的腐蚀，延长使用寿命。这种喷雾器的打气手柄可以从药箱的一边调换到另一边，以便两手轮换打气。
    机动喷雾器近几年也从无到有地发展起来。目前，已经试制成功并投入生产的共有七种。适用于水田地区的“南2604远程喷雾机”，能够就地吸水、自动混药、远程喷布。田间只要有二寸深的浅水，机器就可以吸水正常工作。这种喷雾机射程达十五米，在三十米宽的田块喷药，人和机器都不需要下田，对水稻螟虫等虫害防治效果较高。
    冶金、化工等部门还为植保机械工业试制成功了“塑料复合钢板”和“609环氢抗腐蚀漆”。这两种新材料的耐腐蚀性能比过去使用的虫胶涂料好得多，为进一步提高植物保护机械的质量提供了有利条件。这两种新材料已经在部分产品上开始试用。
    这些新型植保机械是我国农民、科学技术人员和工业企业职工发扬革命精神，破除洋框框，根据我国实际情况设计、试制成功的。南京农业机械化研究所技术人员开始设计“南2604远程喷雾机”时，既无样机，又缺乏技术资料。他们深入江苏、浙江、江西等地农村调查研究，吸取农民群众中有用的经验，终于设计成功受到农民欢迎的远程喷雾机。浙江金华农业机械厂，深入农村，根据农民的要求重新设计，然后把试制的样机再拿到农村，请农民使用，征求意见，反复改进。结果，试制成功了“金蜂—12型背负式喷雾器”。
