　　Xinhua News Agency, February 24th dispatch from New York: As U.S. President Johnson advocated his policy of aggression against Vietnam at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York on the evening of the 23rd, seven thousand members of the New York public, disregarding police obstruction and sabotage by reactionary elements, held a grand anti-war demonstration outside the hotel, demanding the withdrawal of American troops from South Vietnam.
    The demonstrating masses held high the flags of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, chanting in unison: "Johnson, how many children did you kill today?" "End the Vietnam War! Bring the troops back now!" "Burn draft cards! Don't burn children!" Among the demonstrators were also placards with slogans such as: "Great Society: Napalm, Torture, Bombs," "Shame, Shame, Shame," and other slogans. Two demonstrators even held up a large banner that read: "Impeach Johnson!"
    The demonstration lasted three hours. The authorities dispatched hundreds of police officers, plainclothes police, and special agents to "maintain order," and added a section of barricades midway through the demonstration. When Johnson arrived at the hotel, the police hastily escorted him to a side door of the hotel to enter from there, in order to avoid direct protests from the demonstrators. Johnson eventually sneaked out through the side door as well.
    While Johnson was delivering his policy speech in the ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, a person jumped up and shouted anti-war slogans. Subsequently, he was beaten by plainclothes agents in the hall, his face covered in blood, and dragged out.
    Johnson came from Washington that day to accept the 1966 National Freedom Award from the New York "Freedom House" Association and took the opportunity to give a speech to defend his policy of aggression against Vietnam. Demonstrators said that Johnson should not be given the "Freedom Award," but the "Genocide Award." (Attached photo)

　　美国人民反对本国帝国主义的斗争不断发展
　　纽约七千人举行反战示威围攻约翰逊
　　约翰逊害怕示威群众抗议，在发表侵越政策演说后从边门偷偷溜走
    新华社二十四日讯　纽约消息：当美国总统约翰逊二十三日晚上在纽约的华道夫·亚斯多里亚饭店鼓吹侵越政策时，七千名纽约公众不顾警察的阻拦和反动分子的捣乱，在饭店外面举行了盛大的反战示威，要求美军撤出南越。
    示威群众高举着越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，齐声高呼：“约翰逊，你今天杀害了多少儿童？”“结束越南战争！现在就把军队撤回来！”“烧毁征兵证！不要烧死儿童！”等口号。在示威群众中还高举着标语牌，上面写着：“伟大社会：凝固汽油弹、酷刑、炸弹”、“可耻、可耻、可耻”以及其它口号。还有两名示威者高举一面大旗，上面写着：“弹劾约翰逊”！
    示威进行了三小时。当局出动了数百名警察、便衣警察和特务来“维持秩序”，并且在示威游行的中途增添了一段路障。当约翰逊来到饭店时，警察们慌忙把他保驾到饭店的边门，让他从那里进去，以免遭到示威群众的直接抗议。约翰逊最后也是从边门偷偷地离开的。
    当约翰逊在华道夫·亚斯多里亚饭店的大厅里发表政策演说时，有一个人跳起来高呼反战口号，随后，他遭到场内便衣特务的殴打，脸上流着鲜血，并被架了出去。
    约翰逊是在这一天从华盛顿前来接受纽约“自由之家”协会一九六六年全国自由奖、并借机发表演说，为侵越政策辩解的。示威者说，不应该给约翰逊“自由奖”，而应该给他“灭绝种族奖”。（附图片）
