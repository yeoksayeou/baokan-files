    The General Political Department Calls on the Entire Army to Learn from Mai Xiande in Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works
    Be a Lifelong Proletarian "Volunteer Soldier"
    Be Ready to Eliminate Invading Enemies at Any Time
    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd – The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a notice today, calling on the broad masses of commanders and fighters of the entire army to learn from Comrade Mai Xiande. The notice requested: to study and apply Chairman Mao's works with profound class feelings like Mai Xiande, and to work hard on the word "application"; to wholeheartedly serve the people, and be a lifelong proletarian "volunteer soldier"; to carry forward the revolutionary heroism spirit of our army of fearing neither heaven nor earth, and daring to overwhelm all enemies, and be ready to eliminate invading enemies at any time. The full text of the notice is as follows:
    Comrade Mai Xiande is an engine room soldier of a certain unit of the Navy's South Sea Fleet. In the battle to annihilate the U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek ships "Jianmen" and "Zhangjiang" on August 6, 1965, he persisted in fighting despite a serious head injury, demonstrating the steel-like fighting will of a revolutionary soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mai Xiande is truly worthy of being a hard bone of the proletariat.
    Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "What is the best weapon? It is not airplanes, not artillery, not tanks, not atomic bombs, the best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. What is the greatest combat effectiveness? The greatest combat effectiveness is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is bravery, not fearing death." The heroic deeds of Comrade Mai Xiande once again vividly prove this truth.
    Comrade Mai Xiande is another good example for the commanders and fighters of our army to learn from. Currently, U.S. imperialism is shifting the focus of its counter-revolutionary global strategy from Europe to Asia, frantically expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, and directing the spearhead of aggression at our country. Our army must be a hundred times more vigilant, effectively strengthen war preparedness, and be ready at any time to strike at the U.S. aggressors. Under such circumstances, learning from Mai Xiande, a heroic figure who has undergone severe combat tests, is of greater significance. In learning from Comrade Mai Xiande, we should:
    1. Study and apply Chairman Mao's works with profound class feelings, and work hard on the word "application." In all work, under any circumstances, act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. Put into practice the teachings of Chairman Mao on serving the people wholeheartedly, proceeding from the interests of the people in everything, being selfless, benefiting others, enduring hardship before enjoying comfort, tirelessly, and dedicating everything without hesitation when the interests of the people require it.
    2. Regard doing revolutionary work, serving in the military, and shedding blood and sacrificing in battle as fulfilling obligations for the great cause of communism, not haggling over prices in work, not calculating rewards, not fearing dangers, not seeking honor, and willingly being a proletarian "volunteer soldier" for life, and being a "volunteer soldier" striving for the cause of communism for life.
    3. Hold the gun tightly, "be ready to eliminate invading enemies at any time." Maintain a high degree of combat vigilance against the sabotage of U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries. Carry forward the revolutionary heroism tradition of our army, fearing neither heaven nor earth, being brave and tenacious, invincible, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory, and overwhelming all enemies.
    The heroic deeds of Comrade Mai Xiande, like the deeds of other heroic figures and advanced units in our army, are the result of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and giving prominence to politics. Through the activities of publicizing and learning from Comrade Mai Xiande, we must further launch a new upsurge of greater and more extensive study of Chairman Mao's works, regard Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instructions for all tasks of our army, unswervingly implement Comrade Lin Biao's five principles of continuing to give prominence to politics, and better carry out the movement to create four-good companies. We must put the foothold of all work on the word "fight," and prepare for the enemy to fight early, fight big, fight a nuclear war, fight all kinds of wars, and fight on several fronts, and make our own contributions to completely burying U.S. imperialism.

    总政号召全军象麦贤得那样活学活用毛主席著作
    当一辈子无产阶级“义务兵”
    随时准备消灭来犯的敌人
    新华社三日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部今天发出通知，号召全军广大指战员学习麦贤得同志。通知中要求：象麦贤得那样带着深厚的阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫；全心全意为人民服务，当一辈子无产阶级的“义务兵”；发扬我军天不怕，地不怕，敢于压倒一切敌人的革命英雄主义精神，随时准备消灭来犯的敌人。通知全文如下：
    麦贤得同志是海军南海舰队某部轮机兵。在一九六五年八月六日歼灭美制蒋舰“剑门号”和“章江号”的战斗中，他头负重伤，坚持战斗，表现了毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士钢铁般的战斗意志。麦贤得同志不愧为无产阶级的硬骨头。
    林彪同志指出：“什么是最好的武器？不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。什么是最大的战斗力？最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢，不怕死。”麦贤得同志的英雄事迹，又一次生动地证明了这一真理。
    麦贤得同志是我军指战员学习的又一个好榜样。当前，美帝国主义正在把它的反革命全球战略的重点从欧洲转移到亚洲，疯狂地扩大侵略越南战争，并且把侵略的矛头指向我国。我军要百倍提高警惕，切实加强战备，随时准备打击美国侵略者。在这种情况下，学习麦贤得这样一个经过严重战斗考验的、过硬的英雄人物，具有更大的意义。学习麦贤得同志，我们应当要：
    一、带着深厚的阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。在一切工作中，在任何情况下，都要按照毛主席的指示办事。把毛主席关于全心全意为人民服务、一切从人民的利益出发的教导，毫不利己、专门利人、吃苦在前、享受在后的教导，身体力行，孜孜不息，在人民的利益需要的时候，毫不犹豫地献出自己的一切。
    二、把干革命工作，把服兵役，把战斗中流血牺牲，看作是为共产主义的伟大事业尽义务，在工作中不讲价钱，不计报酬，不畏艰险，不图荣誉，心甘情愿地当一辈子无产阶级的“义务兵”，当一辈子为共产主义事业奋斗的“义务兵”。
    三、握紧手中枪，“随时准备消灭来犯的敌人”。对美帝国主义和一切反动派的捣乱，保持高度的战斗警惕。发扬我军革命英雄主义的传统，天不怕，地不怕，英勇顽强，有我无敌，排除万难，争取胜利，压倒一切敌人。
    麦贤得同志的英雄事迹，同我军其他英雄人物和先进单位的事迹一样，都是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治的结果。通过宣传和学习麦贤得同志的活动，要进一步掀起更大、更广泛的学习毛主席著作的新高潮，把毛主席的书当作我军各项工作的最高指示，坚定不移地贯彻执行林彪同志继续突出政治的五项原则，更好地开展创造四好连队运动。要把全部工作的立脚点放在“打”字上，做好对付敌人早打、大打、打核战争、打各种战争、在几条战线上打的准备，为彻底埋葬美帝国主义，作出自己的贡献。
