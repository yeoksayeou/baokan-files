    Revolutionary Courage as High as Mountains, Class Feelings as Deep as the Sea
    Work for the Revolution and the People Thoroughly Like Jiao Yulu
    The Broad Masses of Cadres in Lankao County Go Deep into the Masses, Rely on the Masses, and Bravely Go to Difficult Places to Temper Themselves and Struggle
    (Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th) Mao Zedong's good student – the former Secretary of the Lankao County Party Committee, Jiao Yulu, dedicated himself to the revolution and completely and thoroughly served the people. This spirit has transformed into a tremendous force for the broad masses of cadres in Lankao County to transform their subjective world and lead the masses to transform the objective world. After Jiao Yulu's death, many cadres, upon mentioning him, were so moved that they could not control themselves, with tears in their eyes saying: What's the use of just crying! We must put our efforts into class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. They take Jiao Yulu as an example, going deep into the masses, caring for the people's suffering, uniting the masses, and inheriting Jiao Yulu's legacy to carry out the struggle to build a new Lankao.
    Caring for and Relying on Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Like Jiao Yulu
    Among the cadres and masses in Lankao, class feelings are as deep as the sea. This class feeling was cultivated by the Party and Jiao Yulu and is also the result of the broad masses of cadres learning from Jiao Yulu.
    Zhang Jingchun, the Guiding Instructor of the Guyang Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative, is now a respected old Party member by the poor and lower-middle peasant commune members of the entire commune. He said: "Since I got to know Jiao Yulu, and saw how wholeheartedly he was for the people, I can't bear to see class brothers in difficulty."
    It was an early morning in October 1963, with heavy wind and rain, and water everywhere. Zhang Jingchun saw a person wearing a raincoat walking out of the wind and rain. He only saw clearly that it was Jiao Yulu when he got closer. He could tell from Jiao Yulu's eyes that he hadn't slept all night. He led Jiao Yulu to see the coal stored in the Supply and Marketing Cooperative's coal yard. Jiao Yulu asked: "When it's cloudy, do the masses come to buy coal? What if they don't have coal to burn? When it rains, fresh sweet potatoes spoil easily. Can we help the production team bake some sweet potato slices?..."
    This old man, over fifty years old, was enlightened by Jiao Yulu and single-handedly pulled five hundred catties of coal that very day, braving the wind and rain to deliver coal to Kongchang. From then on, whenever there was heavy rain or snow, he would take the cadres of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, pulling coal and cold-weather and rain-gear, to village after village to solve the difficulties for the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and poor and lower-middle peasant commune members. Sometimes they had to carry coal carts across the floodwaters, and sometimes they had to carry wooden shovels to clear the snow. No matter what difficulties they faced, as long as they thought about how Jiao Yulu worked, they were full of energy. Zhang Jingchun saw the masses stringing fresh sweet potato slices with ropes to prevent them from spoiling, so he purchased more than 5,000 catties of waste telephone wire from the postal and telecommunications departments to supply the masses, helping the commune members to preserve the fresh sweet potato slices in rainy weather.
    On cold winter nights, Zhang Jingchun thought about which poor peasants were suffering from the cold, and went to deliver cotton and cloth the next morning. Some of these items were relief supplies, and some he bought with his own money. He picked up his rice bowl and thought of the poor peasant family in Liulou who didn't have enough bowls, so he sent the Supply and Marketing Cooperative's bowls to them. When it rained heavily, he thought of the Liulou's cattle shed that hadn't been built, and the mud bricks were still outside, so he immediately ran over and quietly covered the mud bricks. He made a carrying pole from waste materials and a trough for the cattle from an old cargo box, and took them all to help the poor peasants and poor teams.
    The Party branch work of the Dafutang Brigade of the Guyang Commune has been done relatively well in recent years. The Party members and poor and lower-middle peasant commune members are united as one. Jiao Yulu visited this brigade three times during his lifetime. Once, Jiao Yulu asked the Party Branch Secretary, Yang Shisen, how to rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants? Yang Shisen said that he didn't have many methods. Jiao Yulu said: "You should have each Party member be responsible for several poor and lower-middle peasant households. He should visit them when they are building houses, repairing their homes, or holding weddings and funerals, and help them solve any difficulties they may have. If his family has no labor force and he is sick, you should fetch water for him and ask a doctor to see him. If the brigade has any problems, or when the busy farming season arrives, you should discuss them with them."
    A day later, at 11:00 PM, Jiao Yulu called Yang Shisen from the County Party Committee, saying that when he left Dafutang yesterday, he went to see the poor peasant feeder, Wang Yeyun. Wang Yeyun suggested that he had raised two calves in three years, and he did not receive the bonus for encouraging livestock development when the first calf was born. Jiao Yulu said: "You must solve this problem. The more the poor peasants cherish the collective, the more you must care about the interests of the poor peasants."
    The unity of the Dafutang Brigade Party Branch with all the poor and lower-middle peasants began at this time. Yang Shisen was responsible for the four households of poor peasants Liang Pingshan, Xie Fuxing, and others. Once, both of Liang Pingshan's sons were ill. His team was not doing well in production, and Liang Pingshan's life was even more difficult. The brigade prepared to issue relief funds to Liang Pingshan. Yang Shisen thought: "Jiao Yulu told us to care about the poor and lower-middle peasants so that we can unite and fight against difficulties. Simply issuing relief funds will not achieve this goal." He called together more than eighty poor and lower-middle peasants from the seven teams to hold a meeting. At the meeting, everyone relived the days of suffering in the past and talked about the victory of the poor and lower-middle peasants in making revolution together, connecting the hearts of more than eighty poor and lower-middle peasants. Everyone said: "Liang Pingshan is in trouble and should not rely on the state, but on our class brothers." So, some gave one yuan, and others gave a few cents, raising money to cure Liang Pingshan's sons. This event was a profound education for every poor and lower-middle peasant in Dafutang. Last year, Liang Pingshan actively led the commune members to overcome drought and waterlogging, and the entire production team produced an average of eight hundred catties of grain per person.
    The Dafutang Brigade has three thousand mu of cogon grass land that cannot be plowed and yields no harvest when planted. Jiao Yulu said when he was alive: "As long as the Party members and poor and lower-middle peasants are united as one, this land will definitely be cultivated well." In order to commemorate Jiao Yulu, the Party members of this brigade led the poor and lower-middle peasants, carrying ropes on their shoulders to pull the plow, until the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, breaking thirty-two plows. Of the plowed land, two thousand mu were planted with sorghum last year, averaging two hundred and fifty catties per mu.
    Facing Difficulties Like Jiao Yulu
    In the minds of Lankao cadres, Jiao Yulu is a heroic image standing tall in the face of difficulties. His revolutionary ambition and heroic feelings encourage and inspire Lankao cadres to lead the masses to fight against difficulties. Cadres who were about to be transferred to work elsewhere filed petitions to the organization, requesting that they be allowed to stay until the appearance of Lankao was changed before leaving. Cadres who were not originally settled in their work are learning from Jiao Yulu and resolutely taking root among the masses.
    Zhao Xiang, who works in the Lankao County Economic Commission, has become someone who faces no difficulties by learning Jiao Yulu's fearless revolutionary spirit. That autumn, there was a lot of rain, the highways were muddy, and the weather was very bad. The grain reserves in the Nan Zhang and Zhang Junmu Commune granaries were running low. 1.2 million catties of grain had to be transported from Lankao County within five days to supply the disaster victims. The county leadership gave this transportation task to Zhao Xiang, asking him if there were any difficulties. He said: "No." During transportation, he took the lead in facing difficulties; he relied on the masses, and within five days, he completed the transportation task using trucks, horse-drawn carts, and handcarts. Last May, Han Village in the Yellow River beach was in danger of collapsing into the Yellow River. That night, the leadership gave Zhao Xiang the task of moving the village. He said: "Guarantee the completion, no difficulties!" He led ten trucks to Han Village and directed the relocation. They spent two days and two nights moving this village, which had a total of one hundred and eighty people and more than one hundred houses, completely from trees, bricks and tiles to household miscellaneous items.
    In the paulownia sapling nursery of the Laohanling Brigade of the Chengguan Commune, there is a small house where two college graduates studying paulownia live. They are from the South, one named Wei Jianzhang and the other named Zhu Lichu. These sons of poor and lower-middle peasants firmly remember what Jiao Yulu told them during his lifetime, encouraging each other to inherit Jiao Yulu's legacy and turn Lankao's sand dunes and sandy areas into the greenest and most beautiful places.
    Jiao Yulu was a man who loved trees. He came to this nursery twice during his lifetime. At that time, Wei Jianzhang and Zhu Lichu still lived in a small earthen cave. Having just arrived in Lankao from Jiangnan, where the wind and sand were rampant, they were not accustomed to the life. They had to cook their own meals, and because the climate was dry, they often had nosebleeds. Just when they were unsettled and hesitant, a person with a bare chest, frank and optimistic, came in a windy and sandy day. This person was Jiao Yulu. As soon as he came, he said that he loved paulownia because paulownia is important to Lankao's agricultural production and socialist construction. After inquiring about the family and work situation of these two young people, he said with great interest: "Lankao has nearly one million mu of land, which can be used for intercropping 400,000 mu of paulownia and crops. This condition is rare in the Jiangnan water towns. Your future is so broad!" The hearts of the two young people immediately rose, and they felt that Jiao Yulu was the one who understood them best. Jiao Yulu said: "If you want to achieve a revolutionary career in the face of difficulties, you must first contact the masses and learn from the masses. Paulownia can only have lush branches and leaves if it takes root in the ground; you can only make contributions to the revolutionary cause if you take root among the masses." A few days later, they bought rice when they went to buy grain, and the salesman said: Secretary Jiao specially approved it for you.
    Jiao Yulu's cordial conversation and enthusiastic care made these two young people determined to contribute to changing the appearance of Lankao. From that time on, they and the poor and lower-middle peasants sealed sand dunes, reclaimed wasteland, and planted trees in the mud and water. At night, they sometimes slept with the poor peasants and sometimes slept in the fields, measuring the changes in temperature and humidity in the forest. They also carried out various scientific experiments and research activities. Now, rows of paulownia trees are growing, and the two young people have become strong. Thanks to their hard work with the masses, in the past two years, the area of intercropping between crops and paulownia in Lankao County has expanded from more than 10,000 mu to 35,000 mu. They have helped more than 100 brigades establish paulownia nurseries using the small-root seedling method, and 250,000 young paulownia seedlings will be released this spring.
    Working Like Jiao Yulu
    After Jiao Yulu's death, cadres and people in Lankao shed countless tears. The most tears were shed by some good cadres with high awareness, great ambition, and determination to go to difficult places. Li Shenglin is one of them. Li Shenglin originally worked in the Lankao County Party Committee. He applied to the Party three times and five times, asking to send him to work in the Liulin Brigade of the most difficult Chengguan Commune in the county. Because the work he was doing could not be separated for a while, the organization did not approve him. Hearing the news of Jiao Yulu's death, his face was full of tears, and he wrote another application, saying that he must take Jiao Yulu as an example, go to Liulin to mobilize the masses, and change the appearance of the area in three to five years. If he could not change the appearance of Liulin, he would be buried in the alkali nest. The Party approved his application, and the next day he carried his luggage and went to Liulin.
    Liulin is an old alkali nest that has existed for many years. Crops are planted one crop after another, and the masses have lost confidence in cultivating such alkaline land. Li Shenglin served as the Secretary of the Liulin Brigade Party Branch. As soon as he arrived in Liulin, he put his luggage in the home of a poor peasant, just like Jiao Yulu, and conducted investigations and research in the fields for eight or nine consecutive days, finding out the details of the natural disasters. However, how can the masses be mobilized? Li Shenglin knew that Jiao Yulu followed Chairman Mao's teachings and started by caring about the suffering of the masses to mobilize the masses. Li Shenglin's family has a large population, a small labor force, and a low income, and he also suffers from stomach problems, but he does not care about these at all. The heating allowance issued to him by the commune was supplemented with a few dollars to sew a cotton coat for the poor peasant Han Dequan; he wore single shoes and took off his cotton shoes for the lower-middle peasant Wei Jianhua to wear; he did not have many winter clothes, but he gave two pieces to the poor peasant Liu Yongzeng. He said to Liu Yongzeng: "As long as I don't freeze, you won't freeze either." For every bit of suffering he helped the masses relieve, he told the masses a lot about turning over and making revolution. He established a deep class relationship with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor peasants trusted him, and everyone listened to what he said. The poor peasants said: "With our Lao Li, we don't have to worry about Liulin not changing." He led the masses to study Chairman Mao's article "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," which made the masses establish the ambition of self-reliance and hard work. Although not much grain has been harvested on the saline-alkali land in Liulin, people who have gone out have returned one after another, and the strength has been gathered again. In this case, he led the masses to turn over sand and transport sand, transform saline-alkali land, build terrace fields, and scrape alkali. After a year of hard work, 410,000 catties of grain were harvested last year, more than double that of 1964. What is valuable is that the masses are no longer afraid of difficulties, and their fighting spirit is even higher.
    In February 1965, the Lankao County Party Committee transferred Wang Qide, who was working in the County Party Committee, to serve as the Party Committee Secretary of the Zhao Ying Commune. This young man who was just starting out as a "squad leader" could not sleep all night after accepting this task. He had a lot of difficulties in front of him. He asked himself: Didn't Jiao Yulu want to break a path in the face of difficulties? Thinking of this, he made up his mind: learn from Jiao Yulu and rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants. At dawn, he packed his luggage and set off. Jiao Yulu went to the countryside the second day after arriving at the County Party Committee. Wang Qide went to Zhang Zhuang to stay at a point with his luggage the second day after arriving at the Zhao Ying Commune. The members of the Commune Party Committee were accustomed to going out early and returning late, and going to the team for a walk and then returning. Wang Qide knew that Jiao Yulu's solution to this kind of problem was not to criticize anyone, but to stay in the team himself first. He did so, and it did indeed have good results, and everyone stayed in the team to work in depth.
    There are two kinds of people in the Party Committee: newcomers and those who were originally there. Wang Qide asked himself: How did Jiao Yulu lead the work of the Party Committee? Jiao Yulu said: The first is the unity of the leadership core and the democratic style of the "squad leader." Wang Qide studied Chairman Mao's "Working Methods of Party Committees" several times, and he was even more convinced that Jiao Yulu's approach was correct. The Commune Party Committee discussed many times to replace several incompetent Party Branch Secretaries. The new members spoke very actively, and the original members remained silent. Wang Qide knew that Jiao Yulu would not draw conclusions whenever he met people who knew a lot about the situation and did not express their opinions, and he would not ask these people who did not speak to speak on the spot, but would conduct individual talks after the meeting to reach a consensus. Wang Qide did this, and the result was that the problem was properly handled.
    Because Wang Qide learned to be a "squad leader" like Jiao Yulu, united all the cadres, led the masses, and did a good job.
    Caring About the People's Suffering Like Jiao Yulu
    On the eve of Jiao Yulu's death, in a coma, he said intermittently to his lover: "I heard someone in the corridor outside say that it's raining heavily in Lankao, please go and ask." Jiao Yulu's noble spirit of being concerned about the safety of the people even at his deathbed will never be forgotten by the cadres and people at all levels in Lankao. Many cadres followed this spirit. In 1964, three months after Jiao Yulu's death, on August 18, Lankao had 180 millimeters of heavy rain in one day. On this day, people could not be seen ten steps away in the rain. Several comrades from the County Party Committee went to Hongmiao in the rain to check the water. When they arrived in Hongmiao South, they saw three people coming, who were three cadres checking the drainage situation of the Hongmiao Ditch; not far to the north, they encountered the Party Branch Secretary of the Hongmiao Brigade, wearing a raincoat, checking the water; when they arrived in Guozhuang, they saw the Women's Director of the Commune wading through the water to send a letter to the Wangzhuang Brigade, asking them to tear down a blocking dam; when they turned to the Qinglonggang Bridge, they saw the militia battalion commander of Daizhuang squatting in the rain to watch the water situation; when they turned to the east of Daizhuang, they met the Party Branch Secretary squatting in the rain to watch the water situation; when they turned to Dafutang, they saw the brigade leader also checking the water. This group of people running around in the wind and rain was inspired by the spirit of Jiao Yulu and came to the fields to check everywhere without prior consultation. They were working in the wind and rain with feelings of mourning for Jiao Yulu.
    In the summer of 1964, Lankao had a much better wheat harvest than in previous years. The comrades of the County Party Committee held Jiao Yulu's portrait and said with tears in their eyes: "If Comrade Jiao Yulu could see this season's harvest, how happy and excited he would be. What new problems would he raise and unite everyone to move forward?"
    Being Thrifty and Simple Like Jiao Yulu
    A comrade from the Lankao County Party Committee saved the socks that Jiao Yulu had personally mended with thousands of stitches as a precious souvenir. The cadres in Lankao have maintained Jiao Yulu's style of hard work and simplicity. In the past few years, no Party or government department has bought a new bicycle. The County Finance Bureau collected the waste bicycles from various units and put together a batch of usable vehicles for some units to use. Every time the county held a conference, the Finance Bureau carefully collected the grass and mats used for the conference for reuse. In order to save expenses, a cadre from the Finance Bureau learned the technology and repaired electric lights and installed doors and windows for 19 departments last year. The comrades of the County Party Committee received 23 yuan in royalties, which they bought into fertilizer and personally applied to the sorghum fields on the terrace fields in Hancun. Last autumn, Hancun had enough grain for self-sufficiency, and the production team had a deposit of 3,000 yuan. The captain returned the 23 yuan to the County Party Committee. The comrades of the County Party Committee were prepared to take it to help a poor team. Lankao County persisted in carrying forward the style of hard work and simplicity left by Comrade Jiao Yulu. In 1965, the county's fiscal surplus was 440,000 yuan, which was prepared for agricultural investment.

    革命胆略山样高　阶级感情海样深
    象焦裕禄那样彻底为革命为人民工作
    兰考县广大干部深入群众依靠群众，勇于到困难的地方去锻炼去斗争
    新华社郑州八日电　毛主席的好学生——前中共兰考县委书记焦裕禄一心为革命，完全、彻底为人民的精神，在兰考县已经变成广大干部改造主观世界和带领群众改造客观世界的巨大力量。焦裕禄逝世以后，许多干部一提起他便激动得不能克制自己，眼里含着泪说：光流泪有什么用！我们要把劲使在阶级斗争上，使在生产斗争上，使在科学实验上。他们以焦裕禄为榜样，深入群众，关心人民疾苦，团结群众，继承焦裕禄的遗志，进行建设新兰考的斗争。
    象焦裕禄那样关心和依靠贫下中农
    在兰考的干部和群众中间，阶级感情象海一样深。这种阶级感情，是党和焦裕禄培植的，也是广大干部向焦裕禄学习的结果。
    这个县的堌阳公社供销社指导员张景春，现在是全公社贫农下中农社员所敬爱的老党员。他说：“自从我认识了焦裕禄，看到他一心为人民，我见了阶级兄弟作难，就走不动路。”
    那是一九六三年十月，一个大风大雨的黎明，遍地是水，张景春看见一个披雨单的人从风雨中走过来，到近处才看清是焦裕禄。他从眼神上看出焦裕禄一夜不曾睡觉。他领着焦裕禄看了供销社的煤场存煤。焦裕禄问道：“连阴天，群众来不来买煤？没烧的咋办？雨天，鲜红芋容易坏，能不能帮助生产队烤些红芋片？……”
    这位五十多岁的老人，受到焦裕禄的启示，在当天便独自拉了五百斤煤，冒着风雨往孔场送煤。从这以后，每当大雨大雪的时候，他就带着供销社的干部，拉着煤，拉着防寒防雨用品，到一个个村庄去为烈属、军属和贫农下中农社员解决困难。他们有时要抬着煤车渡过洪水，有时要带着木锨，铲开雪道。不论有啥困难，只要想到焦裕禄是咋工作的，浑身都是劲。张景春看到群众把鲜红芋片用绳穿起来，挂着可以不坏，他就向邮电部门收购了五千多斤废电话线供应群众，帮助全社群众在雨天保全了鲜芋片。
    在寒冷的冬夜，张景春想着有哪些贫农要受冷，天明就去送棉送布。这些东西，有些是救济物资，有些是他自己花钱买来的；他端起饭碗，想起刘楼有家贫农的碗少，他就把供销社的碗送去；下了大雨，想到刘楼的牛屋没盖成，土坯还在外边，他立即跑去，悄悄把土坯盖好。他用废物做成一根扁担，用旧货箱做成一个牛槽，都拿去帮助贫农和穷队。
    堌阳公社大付堂大队近年来党支部工作做得比较好。党员和贫农下中农社员拧成了一股劲。焦裕禄生前曾经三次来到这个大队。有一次，焦裕禄问党支部书记杨世森怎样依靠贫农下中农？杨世森表示办法不多。焦裕禄说：“你们一个党员包几户贫农下中农。他盖房、修屋、办婚丧喜事，你都去看看，有什么困难，帮助他解决。如果他家里没劳动力，人又病了，你就给他担水，请大夫看病。大队有了啥问题，或到了生产忙季，你就同他们商量一下。”
    隔一天，深夜十一点钟，焦裕禄从县委给杨世森打来电话，说昨天他离开大付堂时，去看贫农饲养员王业云。王业云提意见说，他喂的母牛三年里生了两头小牛，生头一只小牛时，他就没有领到奖励发展牲畜的奖金。焦裕禄说：“这个问题你们一定要解决。贫农越是爱护集体，你们越要关心贫农的利益。”
    大付堂大队党支部与全体贫下中农的团结一致，就是从这时候开始的。杨世森分包了贫农梁平山、谢福兴等四户。有一次，梁平山的两个儿子都病了。他所在的队，生产不好，梁平山生活更困难。大队准备发给梁平山救济款，杨世森想：“焦裕禄生前叫我们关心贫下中农，是为了团结一致，同困难斗争。单发救济款是不能达到这个目的的。”他把七个队的八十多个贫农下中农叫到一块儿开会。会上大家重温了过去受苦受难的日子，讲了贫下中农团结闹革命的胜利，把八十多个贫下中农的心连结在一起了。大家说：“梁平山有困难，不该依赖国家，应该依靠咱们阶级兄弟。”于是，你一元，他几角，凑钱给梁平山的儿子治好了病，这件事对大付堂的每一个贫下中农都是一次深刻的教育。去年，梁平山积极带领社员战胜了干旱、内涝，全生产队平均每人生产了八百斤粮食。
    大付堂大队有三千亩茅草地，犁也犁不动，种了没收成。焦裕禄在世的时候曾经说：“只要党员和贫下中农拧成一股绳，这样的地一定能种好。”为了纪念焦裕禄，这个大队的党员们带领贫下中农，肩头背着绳子拉犁，一直犁到腊月二十八，拉坏了三十二张犁。犁好的地，去年有两千亩种了高粱，平均每亩收了二百五十斤。
    象焦裕禄那样对待困难
    在兰考干部的心目中，焦裕禄是个巍然屹立于困难面前的英雄形象。他那种革命的壮志豪情，鼓舞着和激励着兰考干部领导群众去同困难作斗争。要被调往别处去工作的干部，噙着泪向组织申诉，要求留下他，等改变了兰考面貌再走；原来不安心工作的干部，都学习焦裕禄，毅然决然地在群众间扎了根。
    在兰考县经济委员会工作的赵翔，学习焦裕禄大无畏的革命精神，成了一个面前无困难的人。那年秋天多雨，公路翻浆，天气很坏，南彰和张君墓公社粮库的存粮快光了。一百二十万斤粮食必须在五天里从兰考县城运到，供应灾民。县领导上把这个运输任务交给赵翔，问他有困难没有，他说：“没有。”在运输中，他迎着困难走在最前面；他依靠群众，在五天里用汽车、马车、架子车，就完成了运输任务。去年五月，黄河沙滩上有个韩庄有坍塌到黄河水里的危险。当夜，领导上把迁村的任务交给赵翔。他说：“保证完成，没有困难！”他带领十部汽车赶到韩庄，指挥搬运。他们用了两天两夜的时间，把这个共有一百八十口人、一百多间房屋的村庄，从树木、砖瓦到家用杂什，搬得干干净净。
    在城关公社老韩陵大队的泡桐苗圃里有间小房子，里面住着两个研究泡桐的大学毕业生。他们是南方人，一个叫魏建章，另一个叫朱礼楚。这一对贫下中农的儿子牢牢记着焦裕禄生前对他们说的话，互相勉励着继承焦裕禄的遗志，要把兰考的沙丘和沙区变成最绿最美的地方。
    焦裕禄是个酷爱树木的人，他生前两次来这个苗圃。那时候，魏建章和朱礼楚还住在一个地庵子里，他们从江南初到这风沙弥漫的兰考，生活不习惯，饭要自己做，因为气候干燥，常常流鼻血。正在他们安不下心、犹豫不定的时候，一个风沙天，来了个袒胸露怀、爽朗而乐观的人，这个人就是焦裕禄。他一来，就说他热爱泡桐，因为泡桐对兰考的农业生产和社会主义建设有重要作用。他询问了这两个青年的家庭和工作情况后，就兴致勃勃地说：“兰考有近百万亩地，可以搞四十万亩泡桐和农作物间作。这个条件是江南水乡少有的，你们的前途多么广阔！”两个青年的心立即升腾起来，觉得焦裕禄是最了解他们的人。焦裕禄说：“你们要在困难中成就一番革命事业，必须首先联系群众，向群众学习。泡桐在地上扎了根，才能枝叶茂密；你们在群众中间扎了根，才能对革命事业作出贡献。”过后几天，他们去买粮时买到了大米，营业员说：是焦书记专门批给你们的。
    焦裕禄的这次亲切的谈话和热情的关怀使这两个青年下决心要为改变兰考的面貌出一把力。从那时候起，他俩和贫下中农一道在泥里水里封沙丘，垦荒地，种树木。夜晚，他们有时同贫农们睡在一起，有时睡在田野里，测量林里的气温和湿度的变化。他们还进行各种科学的试验研究活动。现在，一行一行的泡桐树正在成长，两个青年锻炼得坚强了。由于他们和群众一道辛勤劳动，近二年，兰考县农作物和泡桐间作的面积由一万多亩扩大到三万五千亩。他们帮助一百多个大队，采用小根育苗的办法建立了泡桐苗圃，今春将有二十五万株幼桐出圃。
    象焦裕禄那样工作
    焦裕禄逝世后，兰考干部和人民不知流过多少泪。流泪最多的是一些觉悟高、志气大、决心到困难地方去的好干部。李盛灵就是其中的一个。李盛灵原来在中共兰考县委工作。他三番五次向党申请，派他到全县最困难的城关公社刘林大队去工作。因为他担任的工作一时离不开，组织上没有批准他。听到焦裕禄去世的消息，他满脸泪水，再次写了申请书，他表示一定要以焦裕禄作榜样，去刘林发动群众，在三五年内改变那里的面貌。如果改变不了刘林的面貌，就葬身于碱窝。党批准了他的申请，第二天他就扛着行李到刘林去了。
    刘林是个多年的老碱窝。庄稼种一茬，死一茬，群众对耕种这样的碱地丧失了信心。李盛灵担任了刘林大队党支部书记，他一到刘林，就象焦裕禄那样，把行李放在一个贫农的家里，一连八九天，在田野里调查研究，查明了自然灾害的底细。但是，怎样才能把群众发动起来？李盛灵知道，焦裕禄是按照毛主席的教导从关心群众的疾苦入手，来发动群众的。李盛灵家里人口多，劳动力少，收入少，他还害胃病，但是他全然不顾这些。公社发给他的烤火费，他又添几块钱为贫农韩德泉缝了一身棉衣；他自己穿单鞋，脱下棉鞋给下中农魏建华穿；他的冬衣不多，但是他分了两件给贫农刘永曾。他对刘永曾说：“只要冻不着我，也冻不着你。”他帮助群众解除一分疾苦，就讲给群众十分翻身闹革命的道理。他同贫下中农们建立了深厚的阶级感情。贫农们信服他，他说啥大家都听。贫农们说：“有了俺们的老李，不愁刘林不变。”他领导群众学习了毛主席的文章《愚公移山》，使群众树立了自力更生奋发图强的志气。刘林的盐碱地上虽然还没有收到多少粮食，但是外出的人已纷纷回家，力量又聚集起来了。在这种情况下，他领导群众翻沙运沙，改造盐碱地，修筑台田，起碱刮碱，经过一年的苦斗，去年收到四十一万斤粮食，比一九六四年增加了一倍多。可贵的是，群众不再骇怕困难，斗志更高了。
    一九六五年二月，中共兰考县委调原在县委工作的王启德去爪营公社担任党委书记。这位初当“班长”的年轻人接受这个任务后，一夜没有睡着。他面前是一大堆困难。他自问道：焦裕禄在困难面前不是要杀出一条路来吗？想到这一点，他便拿定主意：学习焦裕禄，依靠贫下中农。天明，他打好行李出发了。焦裕禄是到县委的第二天下乡的，王启德到了爪营公社的第二天，就带着行李到张庄蹲点去了。这个公社党委的委员们习惯于早出晚归，到队里转一转就回来。王启德知道焦裕禄解决这类问题，不是向谁提出批评，而是自己先在队里住下来。他这样办了，果然收到了好的效果，大家也都蹲在队里深入工作了。
    党委会内有新来的和原在的两种人。王启德自问道：焦裕禄是怎样领导党委会工作呢？焦裕禄说过：首先是领导核心的团结一致和“班长”的民主作风。王启德又学了几遍毛主席的《党委会的工作方法》，更相信焦裕禄的做法是正确的。公社党委多次讨论要撤换几个不称职的党支部书记，新来的委员发言很积极，原来的委员都沉默不语。王启德知道，焦裕禄每遇到了解情况多的人不表示态度，是不肯做结论的，同时也不当场要这些不发言的人发言，而是经过会后个别交谈，取得意见的一致。王启德这样做了，结果使问题得到了正确处理。
    由于王启德学习着象焦裕禄那样当“班长”，团结了全体干部，领导群众，做好了工作。
    象焦裕禄那样关心人民疾苦
    焦裕禄去世前夕，在昏迷状态中，断断续续对他的爱人说：“我听外边走廊上有人说，兰考下了大雨，你快去问问。”焦裕禄这种临终仍以人民的安危为怀的崇高精神，是兰考各级干部和人民永远不会忘记的。许多干部都照着这种精神去做。一九六四年焦裕禄去世三个月以后，八月十八日兰考一天下了一百八十毫米大雨。这天，雨下的十步以外都看不见人。县委的几个同志冒雨到红庙去查水。到红庙南地，见过来三个人，是三个干部查看红庙沟排水情况的；北走不远，遇到披着蓑衣查水的红庙大队党支部书记；到郭庄，见公社的妇女主任趟着水匆忙给王庄大队送信，要他们扒一个阻水口；转到青龙岗大桥，看见戴庄的党支部书记在顺着河水走；到戴庄东头，又遇到民兵营长蹲在雨中看水势；转到大付堂，见大队长也在查水。他把县委的几个同志送到西茨蓬，路上又遇到了公社党委副书记。这一群在大风大雨中奔走的人，是受了焦裕禄精神的感染，才不约而同来到田野里四处查看的。他们是怀着对焦裕禄的悼念之情，在风雨中工作的。
    一九六四年夏天，兰考有了个较往年大好的麦收。县委的同志拿着焦裕禄的遗照，含着泪说：“焦裕禄同志能看到这季收成，不知道该多高兴，多兴奋，他又会提出什么新的问题，把大家拧成一股劲，往前干呢？”
    象焦裕禄那样艰苦朴素
    兰考县委的一位同志把焦裕禄亲手千针万线缝补过的袜子，当作珍贵的纪念品保存下来。兰考的干部保持了焦裕禄艰苦朴素的作风。这几年党政部门没有那一个单位买过一辆新的自行车，县财政局把各单位的废旧自行车集中起来，拼制成一批能使用的车子，供一些单位使用；县里每次开大会以后，财政局都把大会用过的铺草、席子，仔细收起，以备再用。财政局一个干部为了节省开支，学习了技术，去年为十九个部门修了电灯，安装了门窗。县委的同志收到二十三元稿费，他们买成化肥，亲自去施进韩村台田的高粱地。去年秋天韩村粮食自给有余，生产队有了三千元的存款，队长又把二十三元钱送回县委，县委的同志们准备再拿去帮助一个穷队。兰考县坚持发扬焦裕禄同志遗留的艰苦朴素的作风，一九六五年县财政节余四十四万元，准备用于农业投资。
