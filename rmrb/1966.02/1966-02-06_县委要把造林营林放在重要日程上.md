    Few forest coverages and insufficient forestry resources are a rather prominent problem in our country. Since liberation, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have repeatedly instructed us that all places capable of planting trees should strive to plant trees, gradually green our country, and beautify the environment in which our people labor, work, study, and live. The instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have become the actions of millions of people, generating tremendous material strength. Over the past ten years, our country's forestry construction work has achieved great successes. Many barren mountains, beaches, and slopes, many roadsides and riverbanks, and the areas in front of and behind many villages have been planted with trees and forests, covering some of the land with greenery. However, in general, forestry construction is still a weak link in our country's national economic construction, lagging behind the needs of national construction and the people's lives. This year, our country has begun to implement the Third Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. In this new period, in order to enable forestry work to better serve national construction and the people's lives, and in order to accelerate the construction of a new socialist countryside, Party committees and governments in various regions need to examine the progress of forestry work, especially afforestation and forest management, and put afforestation and forest management on their important agendas.
    Whether afforestation and forest management work is done well has many reasons, but the decisive factor is the leadership of the Party Committee, especially the leadership of the County Party Committee. Many County Party Committees attach importance to afforestation and forest management. While vigorously grasping grain and major cash crop production, they also vigorously grasp forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery production, and regard tree planting and afforestation as an important work to develop agricultural and livestock production and build a new socialist countryside. In such places, the achievements in forestry construction are more significant. More trees are planted, and the management and maintenance are also good, many of which have grown into forests. However, there are also some County Party Committees that do not attach importance to afforestation and forest management, regarding this work as something that can be done or not done, or even as a burden. They rarely intervene at ordinary times, and often fail to provide strong leadership during the afforestation season. As a result, the quality of afforestation is not high, and the maintenance and management are even worse. Many are planted, but few survive, and even fewer become forests. Not only does it not play its due role, but it also wastes manpower, financial resources, and materials.
    If a County Party Committee is highly responsible to the Party and the people and is full of revolutionary enthusiasm, it should often consider how to completely change the face of the county and build the county well. If the County Party Committee has such a desire and requirement, it will inevitably attach importance to forestry construction based on forest management and afforestation. Dianbai County in Guangdong Province was originally a disaster-stricken county where water, drought, wind, and sand disasters occurred year after year. The Dianbai County Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that failing to lead the people of the county to change the face of nature and failing to build Dianbai into a new socialist countryside "means failing to fulfill the due responsibility." To change the face of nature in Dianbai, it is necessary to vigorously grasp tree planting and afforestation. After more than ten years of efforts, Dianbai County has achieved great success in tree planting and afforestation. In another two or three years, the entire county can basically achieve greening, which has played a major role in developing agricultural production and improving people's lives. The experience of Dianbai County should attract the attention of County Party Committee comrades in various regions.
    "The people have unlimited creativity. They can be organized to march into all places and departments where they can exert their strength, to march into the depth and breadth of production, and to create more and more welfare undertakings for themselves." The County Party Committee must resolutely act in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, thoroughly work for the interests of the people, carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, conscientiously organize and lead the masses, constantly march into the depth and breadth of production, grasp agricultural production, and grasp forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production, fully develop and utilize all natural resources, and create material wealth for the country and the people to the greatest extent.
    For the construction of a new socialist countryside, and for the construction of a powerful socialist country, forestry production is by no means dispensable, but absolutely indispensable. Forestry is an important part of the rural economy, and its relationship with agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations is very close. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: "Agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry are interdependent and indispensable. The three should be placed on an equal footing." With trees, it is possible to conserve water sources, maintain soil and water, regulate rainfall and climate, and ensure stable and high agricultural yields. In many places in our country, especially in many hilly and mountainous areas, soil erosion is serious, and wind and sand droughts are frequent. Only by resolving to build water and soil conservation forests and various protective forests, and implementing comprehensive management of mountains, water, fields, and forests, can we effectively overcome natural disasters and develop agricultural production. Timber is also an important material for national construction and people's lives. All sectors of the national economy, and the people's clothing, food, housing, transportation, and use, are inseparable from forestry production. Many provinces in our country have more mountains and less farmland, and the area of land suitable for forestry is much larger than the area of land suitable for agriculture. In such places, only by grasping forestry production as an important production can we effectively support the country's socialist construction, more quickly develop and strengthen the collective economy of the people's communes, and improve the lives of the members. Planting trees and afforestation is a major event closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. If a county does well in other work, but forestry production is very poor, it is difficult to say that the County Party Committee of this county has completely and thoroughly served the interests of the people.
    "Grasping agriculture can be effective in the current year; grasping forestry can only be effective several years or even more than ten years later. Distant water cannot quench present thirst." Indeed, compared with agricultural production, the cycle of forestry production is longer, and there will be gradual benefits only after several years. However, when we serve the people, should we only consider the current interests of the people? We are proletarian revolutionaries. The current interests of the people should of course be considered, but we should stand high and see far. When taking the first step, we should see how to take the second, third, and even more steps. We should have a unified and comprehensive plan for the construction of a county. Only by carrying out construction in this planned way can we make our countryside richer day by day.
    In fact, the so-called planting trees and afforestation being "distant water" is not that distant. The experience of many places has proved that as long as we effectively strengthen leadership, fully mobilize the masses, and fight hard for three to five years, or eight to ten years, forestry production will be profitable. The longer the time, the greater the benefits. Longqiao Commune in Nanchong County, Sichuan Province, began to plant a large amount of cogongrass and build fast-growing fuelwood forests in 1962. In three years, it solved the problem of firewood for the masses. Conversely, if we think that planting trees and afforestation is "distant water" and never grasp it, many urgent needs, such as the lack of wood and the lack of firewood, will never be solved.
    Of course, our country is large, and the destruction of forests under long-term reactionary rule is extremely serious. It is not something that can be done in a short period of time to plant trees in all places where trees can be planted and complete the task of greening the whole country. Therefore, in dealing with tree planting and afforestation, on the one hand, we must dare to despise difficulties strategically and have the heroic spirit of changing the world. On the other hand, we must pay attention to difficulties tactically and do our work in a down-to-earth manner. Some comrades say: "Planting trees is not easy, just dig a pit and plant the seedlings." This is taking forestry production too easily. Trees have life. From sowing and raising seedlings to growing into forests, a series of tasks must be done well. It is necessary to conduct investigations and studies to understand the actual situation in the area, make comprehensive plans, focus on the long term, start from the near term, and carry out work step by step. It is necessary to conscientiously implement the Party and the state's forestry policies, correctly handle forestry rights, and regularly conduct political and ideological education for the masses to fully mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for afforestation and forest management. During the period of tree planting and afforestation, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to fight annihilation battles; after tree planting and afforestation, it is necessary to organize the masses to fight protracted battles and conscientiously grasp the nurturing and management of forests.
    "We are a grain and cotton producing area, and we make a great contribution to the country. It is right for other places to support us with timber." Of course, due to the different situations in each place, the focus of production should also be different. It is entirely correct for concentrated grain and cotton producing areas to focus on grasping grain and cotton production. However, even in such places, the conditions for planting trees and developing forestry production are widespread. Fully utilizing these conditions, while grasping grain and cotton production, also grasping forestry production can not only create better conditions for the further development of agricultural production, but also better meet the diverse needs of people's lives, and can reduce the country's timber supply and reduce the cost of purchasing fuel and wood for the masses. There is no end to serving the people. We must do our best to do everything that is beneficial to the country and the people; we should do our best to solve all the problems that we can solve, and strive to make greater contributions to the country and the people. This is the mind and attitude that revolutionaries should have.
    "Grasping agriculture and forestry will create a conflict of land and labor; if it is not done well, it will affect the development of grain production." This concern is unnecessary. Forestry production and agricultural production do have a contradictory side, but more importantly, they have a mutually promoting side. The contradiction between forestry and grain for land is not prominent in some mountainous and hilly areas, where there is a lot of land suitable for forestry; in plain areas, of course, we should not occupy good arable land to plant trees. As long as we plant trees on all the wasteland, barren land, and "four sides" (around houses, villages, roads, and rivers) and other places where trees can and need to be planted, it will be a great achievement. In the fifteen years since liberation, in addition to achieving remarkable results in large-scale afforestation, Juancheng County in Shandong Province has also done a good job in planting trees on the "four sides." Now, the county averages twenty-seven "four sides" trees per person, and about one-third of the villages have basically planted trees, and 310 villages have built village forest belts, turning into small forest farms. The contradiction between forestry and grain for labor, in general, can be completely resolved as long as it is properly arranged, because the seasons of forestry production are not exactly the same as the seasons of agricultural production. Of course, it takes a process of practice to grasp the laws of forestry production development and learn to correctly handle the relationship between forestry and agriculture and other production undertakings. However, as long as we have the determination to serve the people completely and thoroughly, recognize the position and role of tree planting and afforestation in the development of our country's entire national economy, and closely combine the revolutionary spirit with a scientific attitude, any contradictions can be resolved, and it is entirely possible to achieve both lush forests and abundant grain.
    Planting trees and afforestation and greening our country is a major measure that must be taken to fundamentally change the "poor and blank" face of our country and draw the newest and most beautiful pictures on our land. To accomplish this great and glorious task, we need to go through a long and arduous struggle. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains to transform China." In forestry construction, we must have this spirit. Our generation should set a good example for future generations in this regard!

### 县委要把造林营林放在重要日程上

    县委要把造林营林放在重要日程上
    森林覆被少，林业资源不足，是我们国家的一个相当突出的问题。解放以来，党中央和毛泽东同志一再指示我们，一切能够植树造林的地方都要努力植树造林，逐步绿化我们的国家，美化我国人民劳动、工作、学习和生活的环境。党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，变成千百万群众的行动，产生了巨大的物质力量。十多年来，我国的林业建设工作取得了很大的成就，许多荒山、荒滩、荒坡，许多铁路、公路、河流和渠道两侧，许多村庄的房前屋后，都植了树、造了林，使一部分大地披上了绿装。但是，总的来说，林业建设仍然是我国国民经济建设中的一个薄弱环节，赶不上国家建设和人民生活的需要。今年我国已开始执行发展国民经济的第三个五年计划。在这个新的时期，为了使林业工作能够更好地为国家建设和人民生活服务，为了加速社会主义新农村的建设，各地党委和政府有必要检查一下林业工作进行的情况，特别是造林营林的情况，把造林营林提到重要的议事日程上来。
    造林营林工作做得好不好，原因固然很多，但是起决定作用的是党委的领导，特别是县委的领导。许多县委是重视造林营林的，他们在大抓粮食和主要经济作物生产的同时，也大抓、狠抓林业、牧业、副业和渔业等生产，把植树造林作为发展农牧业生产，建设社会主义新农村的一项重要工作来做。在这样的地方，林业建设的成就就比较显著，树栽得多，养护管理也好，很多已长大成林。但是，也有一些县委不重视造林营林，把这一工作看作可做可不做，甚至当成一种负担。平时很少过问，在造林的季节也常常不能进行有力的领导。结果，造林的质量不高，养护管理更差，栽的多，活的少，成林的更少，不但没有起到应有的作用，反而浪费了人力财力和物力。
    如果一个县的县委是对党、对人民高度负责的，是充满着革命热情的，它就应当经常考虑，怎样才能彻底改变这个县的面貌，把这个县建设好？县委有了这样的愿望和要求，它就不会不重视以营林造林为基础的林业建设工作。广东省电白县，原来是一个水、旱、风、沙灾害连年不断的重灾县。中共电白县委认为，不领导全县人民改变自然面貌，不把电白建设成为社会主义的新农村，“就是没有尽到应尽的责任”。而要改变电白的自然面貌，就必须狠抓植树造林。经过十多年的努力，电白县的植树造林取得了很大的成绩，再过两三年全县就可以基本上实现绿化，这对发展农业生产，改善人民生活起了重大作用。电白县的经验，应该引起各地县委同志们的注意。
    “人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军，替自己创造日益增多的福利事业。”县委要坚决地按照毛泽东同志的指示办事，彻底地为人民的利益工作，就应当发扬不断革命的精神，认真地组织和领导群众，不断地向生产的深度和广度进军，既抓农业生产，又抓林业、牧业和副业生产，充分开发和利用一切自然资源，最大限度地为国家和人民创造物质财富。
    对于建设社会主义新农村来说，对于建设强大的社会主义国家来说，林业生产决不是可有可无的，而是绝对不可缺少的。林业是农村经济的一个重要组成部分，它同农业、牧业和副业的关系是非常密切的。毛泽东同志指示我们：“农、林、牧三者互相依赖，缺一不可，要把三者放在同等地位。”有了林木就能涵养水源，保持水土，调节雨量和气候，保证农业稳产高产。我国有许多地方，特别是许多丘陵山区，水土流失严重，风沙干旱频繁，只有下决心营造水土保持林和各种防护林，实行山、水、田、林综合治理，才能有效地战胜自然灾害，发展农业生产。木材又是国家建设和人民生活中的重要物资，国民经济各部门，人民的衣、食、住、行、用，都离不开林业生产。我国有许多省是山多田少，宜林地比宜农地的面积大得多。在这样的地方，只有把林业生产作为一项重要的生产抓起来，才谈得上有效地支援国家的社会主义建设，更快地发展和壮大人民公社集体经济，改善社员的生活。植树造林，这是一件同国计民生密切相关的大事。如果一个县的其他工作做得都好，而林业生产搞得很差，那就很难说这个县的县委做到了完全彻底地为人民的利益服务。
    “抓农业，当年就能见效；抓林业，几年甚至十几年以后才能见效，远水解不了近渴。”的确，同农业生产比较，林业生产的周期要长一些，几年以后才逐步有收益。但是，我们为人民服务，难道应该仅仅考虑人民当前的利益吗？我们是无产阶级的革命家，人民的当前利益当然应当考虑，但是，我们应当站得高，看得远，在走第一步棋的时候，就看到第二步、第三步甚至更多步棋怎样走，对一个县的建设要有统一的全面的规划。只有这样有计划地进行建设，才能使我们的农村一天天地富裕起来。
    其实，所谓植树造林是“远水”，也并不是那么远。许多地方的经验证明，只要切实加强领导，充分发动群众，奋战三年五年、十年八年，林业生产就会有收益；时间越长，收益越大。四川南充县龙桥公社，从一九六二年开始大种芭茅草，大造速生薪炭林，三年就解决了群众的烧柴问题。反之，如果以为植树造林是“远水”，总不抓它，许多迫切的需要，例如缺木料、缺烧柴等问题，就永远得不到解决。
    当然，我们的国家大，在长期的反动统治下，林木的破坏又极其严重，要使一切能够植树的地方都植上树，完成全国的绿化任务，不是短时期内的事情。因此，在对待植树造林上，一方面要敢于在战略上藐视困难，有改天换地的英雄气概。另方面又要在战术上重视困难，踏踏实实地做好工作。有些同志说：“植树还不容易，挖个坑，把树苗栽上就行了。”这是把林业生产看得太容易了。树木是有生命的，从播种育苗到长大成林，要做好一系列的工作。要通过调查研究，弄清本地区的实际情况，做好全面规划，从远处着眼，从近处着手，一步一步地开展工作。要认真贯彻党和国家的林业政策，正确处理林权问题，经常对群众进行政治思想教育，充分调动群众造林营林的积极性。在植树造林期间，要发动群众打歼灭战；在植树造林以后，要组织群众打持久战，切实抓好林木的抚育管理工作。
    “我们这里是粮棉产区，对国家的贡献不小，外地支援我们木材是应该的。”当然，由于每个地方的情况不同，生产的重点也应该有所不同。粮棉集中产区，着重抓粮棉生产，这是完全正确的。但是，即使是这样的地方，植树造林，发展林业生产的条件，也是广泛存在的。把这方面的条件充分利用起来，在抓好粮棉生产的同时，也抓好林业生产，既可以为进一步发展农业生产创造更好的条件，又可以更好地满足人民生活的多种需要，并且能够减少国家的木材供应，减轻群众购买燃料和木料等开支。为人民服务是没有止境的。凡是对国家和人民有利的事情，都要尽力去做；凡是自己能够解决的问题，都应当尽力自己解决，力争对国家和对人民做出更大的贡献。这才是革命者应有的胸怀，应取的态度。
    “既要抓农业，又要抓林业，争地争劳力的矛盾不好解决；弄不好，就会影响粮食生产的发展。”这种顾虑是不必要的。林业生产同农业生产，固然有互相矛盾的一面，但更重要的是互相促进的一面。林粮争地的矛盾，在部分山区和丘陵地区并不突出，那里宜林的土地很多；在平原地区，当然不应当占用好的耕地去种树，只要把荒滩、荒地和“四旁”等一切可以种树、需要种树的地方都种上树，就是一个很大的成绩。解放十五年来，山东鄄城县除成片造林取得显著成绩外，“四旁”植树也搞得很好。现在，全县平均每人有二十七株“四旁”树，三分之一左右的村庄基本上植满了树，有三百一十个村庄营造起围村林带，变成了一个个的小林场。林粮争劳力的矛盾，一般地说，由于林业生产的季节同农业生产的季节不尽相同，只要安排得当，是完全能够解决的。当然，要掌握林业生产发展的规律，学会正确地处理林业同农业以及其他生产事业的关系，需要有一个实践过程。但是，只要有完全彻底地为人民服务的决心，认识到植树造林在发展我国整个国民经济中的地位和作用，把革命精神同科学态度密切结合起来，任何矛盾都是可以解决的，做到林茂粮丰是完全可能的。
    植树造林，绿化我们的国家，这是从根本上改变我们国家“一穷二白”的面貌，在我们的国土上画最新最美丽的图画所必须采取的一项重大措施。要完成这一伟大光荣的任务，需要经过长期的艰苦的斗争。毛泽东同志说，“愚公移山改造中国”。在林业建设上，必须有这种精神，我们这一代人，应当在这方面为子孙后代树立一个良好的榜样！
