　　Mao Zedong Thought is a Source of Strength and Wisdom
　　——Record of the Struggle of the Shanghai Honglei Youth Group to Produce New Synthetic Fibers
    Mao Zedong Thought is an incomparably sharp ideological weapon guiding people in scientific experiments. As long as people follow Mao Zedong Thought, they will be filled with immense revolutionary impetus; they will be able to break free from the shackles of various metaphysics and outdated conventions, and become smarter; they will be able not only to produce products, achieve results, and climb to the peaks of science and technology, but also to transform people and train people. The process of the Honglei Youth Group of the Shanghai Synthetic Fiber Research Institute trial-producing a new type of synthetic fiber vividly illustrates this truth.
    The most fundamental and advantageous condition - Mao Zedong Thought
    The trial production of this new type of synthetic fiber began in early 1964. At that time, the Honglei Youth Group had only eight people, with an average age of twenty-five. The only "information" they had on hand was a foreign advertisement. However, this group of young people bravely took on this heavy burden. They said: We have no information, no equipment, no experience, and no experts, but we have the most fundamental and advantageous condition - Mao Zedong Thought. With this, other conditions will gradually arise.
    This group of young people grew up under the cultivation and education of the Party. They have a simple, plain, and very firm belief in their hearts: "If the Party says it can be done, it can definitely be done." "As long as we listen to Chairman Mao, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome." The heroic image of Lei Feng and the revolutionary spirit of the people of Daqing and Dazhai have opened up their spiritual world. The imperialist blockade and the betrayal of modern revisionism gave their scientific research task a revolutionary name from the beginning: This is not an ordinary scientific experiment, this is a revolution. The words of the group leader, Qi Zhichao, summarized their common will. He said: "Some people, when they open their mouths, talk about foreign information, and when they close their mouths, talk about imported equipment. They are always shaking their heads and complaining about the tasks assigned by the leadership. We cannot learn from them. We must listen to Chairman Mao and find our own way!"
    Precisely because of this, their first step was to break with the bourgeois scientific research attitude, put proletarian politics first, put Mao Zedong Thought first, and use politics to command technology. At the beginning of their work, they did not just bury themselves in the library to flip through foreign literature and draft "method outlines" behind closed doors, but organized everyone to sit down and study Chairman Mao's works, study the revolutionary spirit of the people of Daqing and Dazhai, which embodies Mao Zedong Thought, and connect it with reality and with their own thoughts to fully discuss the significance of this scientific research task and the attitude they should hold. The brilliance of Mao Zedong's thought illuminated the hearts of this group of young people more and more brightly, their direction became clearer, their motivation became stronger, their courage became greater, and their confidence became firmer. They were determined to regard the process of scientific experiments as a process of self-transformation; in this struggle to trial-produce "special materials," they would forge themselves into people made of "special materials."
    Creating revolutionary conditions with a revolutionary spirit
    Proletarian scientific research workers should first be proletarian revolutionaries. Scientific research should be carried out with strong class feelings and a revolutionary passion. It was with such revolutionary passion that they plunged into the struggle to meet one difficult obstacle after another.
    The first hurdle was finding raw materials.
    Why is finding raw materials also considered a hurdle? Because it reflects two states of mind: "Waiting passively" and acting according to convention? Or "striving actively" and breaking with outdated rules?
    The scope of the Honglei Youth Group's research was originally only spinning. The topics of raw materials, monomers, and polymerization were all the responsibility of other departments. However, what if other departments had not yet "started"? Could they wait until others "started" before conducting their own scientific experiments? No. Could they simply submit a purchase order to the supply and marketing department and wait for the raw materials to be bought before starting? No. If they couldn't, they had to find the raw materials and produce the monomers themselves.
    Based on the principle of focusing on production and being based in China, they all went out and visited almost all the chemical plants, pigment plants, and related research institutes in the city, not even letting go of some Western pharmacies. In this way, one raw material after another was finally obtained.
    The comrades of the Honglei Youth Group had a saying: "We cannot sit and wait for all the conditions to be ready before making revolution. We must create revolutionary conditions with a revolutionary spirit!" They had no laboratory, and it would take a month for the carpenters to build one. The young people took matters into their own hands, and from engineers to apprentices, they all became carpenters and plasterers. In just three days, they converted a nine-square-meter attic into a laboratory. They needed tap water, but the plumbers were not available. They braved the cold wind, dug ditches, and laid pipes themselves....
    Some people doubted: "Is this what scientific and technical workers look like?" They mocked them as "irrelevant and not doing their job." They firmly disagreed with this view. They believed that they were "relevant" to the "topic" of revolution, and "doing" the "job" of revolution. No matter what the "appearance," as long as it was beneficial to the revolution, they would do it. Their experience was: Precisely because they personally participated in the arduous labor of starting a business, the hearts of the comrades were closer, and they had more affection for their work.... Take finding raw materials, for example. In fact, it was conducting an investigation and study. As a result, they had a better understanding of the characteristics, properties, and prices of the raw materials, as well as which ones could be produced in large quantities.
    Daring to take risks and being good at finding patterns
    With the raw materials in hand, the next step was to make them into monomers. They envisioned many process routes and conducted exploratory experiments on different raw materials.
    In the process of the experiment, despite taking a series of preventive measures, explosions and toxic gases still occurred from time to time. Facing these dangers, what encouraged and supported them was still the Party, still Mao Zedong Thought. The group more closely grasped the study of Chairman Mao's works, and everyone's minds became clearer.
    Initially, their understanding was: "When the laws of the scientific field have not yet been mastered by people, there are certain risks. Exploring its laws requires dealing with all kinds of risks. Only by being bold and careful and not afraid of risks can we explore the mysteries of the palace of science."
    Later, they further understood that they should not only be unafraid of risks, but also learn to overcome them; they should not only be brave and tenacious, but also be able to study the laws of controlling and managing toxic gases with a dialectical scientific attitude. They said: Studying Chairman Mao's works has made us gradually understand that toxic gases also have a dual nature. Toxic gases are poisonous and will harm people if they are emitted; but toxic gases are also part of the product and can serve production, and there is the possibility of turning harmful things into beneficial ones. Starting from its dual nature, our correct attitude towards toxic gases should be: First, not be afraid of it; second, overthrow it. They finally found a way to recover the toxic gases, controlled the toxic gases, and increased the recovery rate of raw materials.
    Through this struggle, the young people's feelings for Chairman Mao's works became deeper. In order to express their love for the great leader, and to be able to see Chairman Mao every day and always think of Chairman Mao's teachings, the comrades of the group specially went to the bookstore to carefully select a portrait of "Chairman Mao Visiting All Over the Country" and posted it on the wall of the laboratory.
    "Chairman Mao is by our side, encouraging us to fight!" Everyone's heart was filled with excitement, and they felt that they had gained infinite strength and wisdom. After one experiment after another, and one struggle after another, the hurdle of making monomers was finally broken through.
    How should revolutionaries treat failure?
    Converting monomers into spinning materials was an even more arduous struggle.
    Chairman Mao's great doctrine of "On Practice" encouraged and guided the actions of this group of young people. They were determined to listen to Chairman Mao and take the path of practice. They weighed materials, washed bottles, measured temperatures, recorded data, and poured bottles back and forth. One factor after another, one method after another, countless times of repeated monotonous operations, they experimented day and night.
    The fruits of practice cannot be picked up as easily as some people imagine. Four months had passed, and the experimental records had reached more than five hundred times; however, there was still no clue. Not only was there no clue, but the clues became more and more numerous, more and more complex, and even more and more confused. They used eight words to describe the situation at that time: "At wit's end, entering a maze."
    Temporary failure appeared before them. Everyone's heart felt as heavy as if it was pressed by a block of lead. Where was the problem? Where was the way out? To answer this question, many people were thinking day and night.
    "Is it that our level is really too low?" Some people thought this way.
    "It would be best to find some foreign information to inspire us." Some people placed their hopes here.
    The director of the laboratory, Tang Yunyu, and Qi Zhichao were thinking about the same question: "Should we admit defeat? No, it is too early to draw this conclusion. What is worth considering is our attitude towards failure. How should a revolutionary behave when encountering temporary difficulties and setbacks?"
    Yes! It was at this time that it was even more necessary to guide everyone to study Chairman Mao's works, to correct their direction from Chairman Mao's works, and to correct the blindness in their thinking and work. Tang Yunyu suggested to everyone: Each person should take their own questions and find Chairman Mao's relevant articles. Many comrades read Chairman Mao's relevant works written during the most difficult times of the Chinese revolution.
    People's minds were suddenly enlightened. At the group meeting, everyone talked freely about their experiences, and it was very lively. That anxious and dull mood disappeared. Qi Zhichao said: "We are now like Chairman Mao pointed out during the most difficult years of the revolutionary war, 'the darkness before dawn.' At this time, the most important thing is revolutionary confidence." Shen Bocheng said: "The Party overcame such great difficulties at the time of the Great Revolution's failure, and now we can't hold our breath with these small setbacks?!" Guan Baoqiong said: "The older generation learned warfare from war. Our generation must learn scientific experiments from scientific experiments."
    They understood how to deal with failure. Their experience was:
    First, cognition is a process, a process from not understanding to understanding, from knowing little to knowing more. In the development process of cognition, failure is often unavoidable.
    Second, the mental state must be correct first. If the mental state is not vigorous, the mind will not be calm, personal distractions will take advantage of the situation, and no way can be thought of. If the mental state is revolutionary, the mind will be calm, and a way will definitely be found. When the mental state is correct, failure may become the starting point for victory.
    Third, look at failure with a one-divide-into-two perspective. Temporary failures contain the factors for future success. The previous five hundred or more experiments were not done in vain, at least the perceptual knowledge has deepened, the data has increased, and the level of operation has improved, from the original "knowing nothing" to the current "understanding something." Compared to the beginning, the difficulties have not increased but decreased, and the distance from victory is not farther but closer. When dealing with failure, the important thing is to discover the factors for success from failure and find the reasons for failure, rather than completely negating and losing confidence.
    Daring to practice and being good at practice
    More importantly, they understood that to explore the laws of objective things, they must not only dare to practice, but also be good at practice and be good at using dialectical materialism.
    They conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," and summarized their work accordingly. They found that the reason why the previous stage of practice "entered a maze" was mainly because: although many experiments were done, there was a lack of thorough analysis and research of "discarding the crude and selecting the fine, discarding the false and retaining the true, proceeding from this to that, and proceeding from the superficial to the essence." In the case of "the existence of a majority of contradictions," they did not "use all their strength to find its principal contradiction," and some grasped everything, resulting in "being in a fog."
    Therefore, they started by analyzing the principal contradiction and repeatedly compared and studied a series of factors and data such as temperature, speed, and concentration in the experiment, and re-experimented. They finally further discovered that the central link affecting the reaction was not in the polymerization process itself. This gave them another important lesson: "To grasp the principal contradiction, we must also break all kinds of frameworks. At the beginning of the experiment, we had no frameworks at all. After doing more than five hundred experiments, we had some capital, and we had frameworks in our minds, and we were single-mindedly immersed in polymerization and unable to extricate ourselves. It is not easy to break foreign frameworks, and it is not easy to break our own frameworks."
    Because they accurately grasped the contradiction and concentrated their efforts to besiege the central link, the experiment became more and more smooth, and the clues became clearer and clearer. It was true that "if you grasp this principal contradiction, all problems will be readily solved." When the experiment reached the seven hundred and eightieth time, the first bottle of polymer was obtained. When the experiment reached the one thousand and fiftieth time, the quality of the polymer was higher and more stable.
    Scientific experiments must also have a high sense of "enemy situation"
    The next step was spinning. Spinning requires equipment. Where does the equipment come from? They decided to rely on their own efforts and use indigenous methods. This group of young people who had never done design learned to design. They ran all over the large and small warehouses of the entire institute to find old and waste materials that could be used. In the design, they paid attention to using the existing factory buildings, materials, and other conditions, and tried to spend no money or less money. In this way, they designed, built, used, and modified at the same time. It only took more than two thousand yuan and a quarter of a year to build a spinning equipment that had never been seen before.
    This was not smooth sailing either. They had a total of two sets of indigenous spinning equipment; the one mentioned earlier was already the second set. When they used the first set of equipment for spinning, there was an accident - the equipment broke!
    Some people commented: "Indigenous equipment is not working! Let's try to find a way to import one for modification!" However, their belief in indigenous equipment did not waver. They did not emphasize objective factors, but first strictly examined their subjective thoughts. As a result, they found that this accident could have been prevented. It turned out that they had also estimated this problem, but because they had a fluke mentality, they did not really pay attention to it, and as a result, there was a problem.
    They firmly grasped this incident, seriously and earnestly discussed it many times, summarized the four characters of "strict and difficult," and turned bad things into good things. They said that there can be no half-heartedness in scientific issues, and we must be honest. Fluke is not being honest, it is a bit careless. Breaking superstitions solved the problem of strategically despising difficulties, but we did not pay enough attention to difficulties tactically, so we sometimes fail and have accidents. In class struggle, we must have a high sense of enemy situation. In scientific experiments, we must also have a high sense of "enemy situation."
    In order to win the battle of spinning, they formulated a strict work plan, established many operating systems, and each level was responsible for guarding, and every possibility was imagined and preventive measures were taken. Each link was repeatedly checked, each experiment had a clear purpose, and each rehearsal was summarized. In this way, the second set of equipment was successfully spun for the first time. The silk was finally spun out.
    According to convention, after the silk is spun out, improving the strength of the silk is often listed as a separate topic for research, and it is not long to spend a year and a half. But they put forward a bold plan to conquer the strength barrier in forty days. In this stage of the experiment, because of more than a year of practice, understanding, re-practice, and re-understanding, many of their practices were more conscious. As a result, even they themselves did not expect that they would conquer this barrier in five days.
    A new type of synthetic fiber was born in China! The Honglei Youth Group achieved victory in this struggle to catch up with the world's advanced level. Some people may ask: In their struggle, what is the most valuable thing? Is it the new type of synthetic fiber? This is of course valuable. But the most valuable thing is the change in people's thinking, the growth of people, and the fact that Mao Zedong Thought has begun to take root in the minds of these young people!
    These young people now can't help but talk about their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works. They have developed deep feelings for Chairman Mao's works. They said: "Thousands of difficulties, with Mao Zedong Thought, are not difficult." "Chairman Mao's works are the spiritual food of our scientific and technological workers. It doesn't matter if there are fewer technical and equipment conditions for the time being, but this one cannot be lacking." They believe that in scientific experiments, the revolutionary spirit is the most important, and dialectics is the most important.

　　毛泽东思想是力量与智慧的源泉
　　——记上海红雷青年小组制成新型合成纤维的斗争过程
    毛泽东思想是指导人们从事科学实验的无比锐利的思想武器。只要遵循着毛泽东思想，人们就能浑身充满巨大的革命动力；就能摆脱各种形而上学和陈规旧矩的束缚，变得更聪明；就能不仅出产品，出成果，攀登上科学技术的高峰，而且能改造人，锻炼人。上海合成纤维研究所红雷青年小组试制一种新型合成纤维的过程，生动地说明了这个真理。
    最根本最有利的条件——毛泽东思想
    这项新型的合成纤维是从一九六四年初开始试制的。当时，红雷青年小组只有八个人，平均年龄二十五岁。他们手上唯一的“资料”，是一张国外的广告。但是，这群年轻人勇敢地挑起了这副重担。他们说：我们一无资料，二无设备，三无经验，四无专家，但是，我们却有一个最根本最有利的条件——毛泽东思想。有了这一条，其他的条件都会逐步地有起来。
    这群青年，都是在党的培养教育下成长起来的。他们的心里有这样一个简单、朴素而又十分坚定的信念：“党说能做到，就一定能做到。”“只要听毛主席的话，没有战胜不了的困难。”雷锋的英雄形象，大庆人、大寨人的革命精神，开拓了他们的精神世界。帝国主义的封锁，现代修正主义的背信弃义，使他们一开始就给自己的科学研究任务赋以革命的名义：这不是平平常常的科学实验，这是一场革命。组长祁志超的一番话，概括了他们的共同意志。他说：“有些人，开口外国资料，闭口进口设备，对于领导交下来的任务，老是摇头叫苦。我们不能学他们的样。我们要听毛主席的话，走出自己的路！”
    正因为这样，他们第一步就是同资产阶级的科学研究态度来了个决裂，把无产阶级的政治放在第一位，把毛泽东思想放在第一位，用政治去统帅技术。他们工作一开始，不是只钻到图书馆里去翻外国文献，闭门造车地拟“方法大纲”，而是组织大家坐下来学习毛主席著作，学习体现了毛泽东思想的大庆人、大寨人的革命精神，联系实际，联系思想，充分讨论这次科学研究任务的意义和自己应持的态度。毛主席的思想光辉，把这群青年的心照得越来越亮，大家的方向更明了，动力更足了，胆子更大了，信心更强了。他们决心要把科学实验的过程，当作自我改造的过程；在这场试制“特殊材料”的斗争中，把自己锻炼成“特殊材料”制成的人。
    以革命的精神去创造革命的条件
    无产阶级的科学研究工作者，首先应该是无产阶级革命者。搞科学研究，应该带着强烈的阶级感情，有一股革命的激情。他们就是怀着这样的革命激情，投入了斗争，去迎接面前一个又一个的难关。
    第一关，找原料。
    为什么把找原料也作为一关？因为这里反映了这样两种精神状态：是“坐等”，按惯例办事？还是“力争”，打破陈规？
    红雷青年小组所研究的范围，本来只是纺丝。原料、单体、聚合等课题，都是其他部门的事情。但是，别的部门还没有
  “上马”，怎么办？能等别人“上了马”，自己再去搞科学实验吗？不能。将购料单一开，朝供销科一塞，等待买到了原料再动手吗？也不能。不能，就得自己找原料，自己制单体。
    他们本着着眼于生产，立足于国内的原则，全体出动，差不多访遍了全市所有的化工厂、颜料厂和有关研究所，连有些西药房也不放过。就这样，一种一种原料终于到手了。
    红雷青年小组的同志有一句话：“我们不能坐等条件齐备后再去革命。我们要以革命的精神去创造革命的条件！”他们没有实验室，等木工来盖要一个月。青年们自己动手，从工程师到艺徒，都当起了木匠和泥工，只花三天，就将一座九平方米的阁楼改建成实验室。需要自来水，但是排管工没有空。他们又迎着寒风，挖沟，排管，自己动手干……。
    有人怀疑：“这象科学技术工作者的样子么？”嘲笑他们是
  “文不对题，不务正业”。他们坚决不同意这种看法。他们认为，自己“对”的是革命的“题”，“务”的是革命的“业”。不管什么“样子”，只要对革命有利，就要去干。他们的体会是：正因为亲身参加了创业的艰苦劳动，同志之间的心贴得更紧了，对自己的工作更有感情了……。就拿找原料来说吧，实际上是进行了一次调查研究，结果，他们对原料的特点、性能、价格，以至哪些可以大量生产，都比较心中有数了。
    敢于冒风险，善于找规律
    原料有了，接下去就是将原料制成单体。他们设想了好多条工艺路线，对不同的原料进行探索性的试验。
    在试验过程中，尽管采取了一系列预防的措施，可是，爆炸，毒气，还是不时发生。面对着这些危险，鼓舞和支持着他们的，仍然是党，仍然是毛泽东思想。小组里更加抓紧了毛主席著作的学习，大家头脑更清楚了。
    起初，他们的认识是：“当科学领域的规律尚未被人们掌握的时候，就存在着一定的风险。探索它的规律，就得同各式各样的风险打交道。只有胆大心细，不怕风险，才能探索到科学宝宫中的奥秘。”
    后来，他们进一步懂得了：不仅要不怕风险，而且要学会战胜风险；不仅要勇敢顽强，而且还要能以辩证的科学的态度，研究控制和驾驭毒气的规律。他们说：学习了毛主席的著作，使我们逐渐懂得，毒气也有两重性。毒气有毒，散发出来要害人；但毒气又是产品的一部分，可以为生产服务，存在着将有害转化为有利的可能。从它的两重性出发，我们对待毒气正确的态度应该是：第一，不怕它；第二，斗倒它。他们终于找出了回收毒气的办法，控制了毒气，而且增加了原料的收得率。
    通过这段斗争，青年们对毛主席著作的感情更加深厚了。为了表达对伟大领袖的热爱，为了能天天看到毛主席，时时想到毛主席的教导，小组的同志特地跑到书店去精心挑选了一张“主席走遍全国”的画象，贴在实验室的墙上。
    “毛主席就在我们身旁，鼓舞着我们战斗！”每个人的心里都充满了激动，感到增加了无穷的力量与智慧。制成单体这一关，经过一次又一次的试验，一次又一次的斗争，终于突破了。
    革命者应该怎样对待失败将单体聚合成纺丝材料，是一场更加艰苦的斗争。
    毛主席的《实践论》的伟大学说，鼓舞着、指导着这群青年的行动。他们决心听毛主席的话，走实践的路。他们称料，洗瓶，测温，记数据，烧瓶倒来又倒去，一个一个的因素，一种一种的方法，无数次重复的单调的操作，日日夜夜地试验下去。
    实践的果实，并不象有人想象的那样，可以随手摘来。时间已经过去四个月了，试验的记录已经达到五百多次；但是，仍然毫无眉目。不仅毫无眉目，而且头绪也越牵越多，越牵越复杂，甚至越来越糊涂了。他们用八个字形容了当时的处境：“山穷水尽，走入迷宫。”
    暂时的失败，出现在他们面前。每个人的心都象压着铅块似的沉重。问题在哪里？出路在哪里？为了回答这个问题，许多人在日思夜想。
    “是不是我们的水平真的太低了？”有人这样想。
    “最好能找点外国资料，启发启发。”有人把希望寄托在这里。
    室主任汤蕴瑜和祁志超在想着同一个问题：“要承认失败么？不，下这个结论，还为时太早。值得考虑的，是我们对待失败的态度。一个革命者在遇到暂时的困难、挫折的时候，应当怎么样？”
    对！就是在这个时候，越需要引导大家学习毛主席著作，从毛主席著作中端正自己的方向，纠正自己思想上工作上的盲目性。汤蕴瑜向大家建议：各人带着自己的问题，去找毛主席的有关文章。许多同志都读了毛主席在中国革命最困难的时候所写的有关著作。
    人们的头脑豁然开朗了。小组会上，大家畅谈体会，热烈非常。那股焦急、沉闷的情绪消失了。祁志超说：“我们现在就象毛主席在革命战争最艰苦年月里所指出的，是‘黎明前的黑暗’。在这个时候，最重要的是革命的信心。”沈伯成说：“大革命失败时那么大的困难，党都战胜了，现在这一点点小挫折，我们就沉不住气了？！”管宝琼说：“老一辈从战争中学会了战争。我们这一辈，要从科学实验中学会科学实验。”
    他们懂得了应该如何对待失败。他们的体会是：
    第一，认识是一个过程，是一个从不懂到懂、从知之不多到知之较多的过程。在认识的发展过程中，失败往往是难以避免的。
    第二，精神状态首先要对头。精神状态不振作，头脑就不会冷静，个人的杂念就会乘虚而入，就一点也想不出办法。精神状态是革命的，头脑就冷静，就一定会想出办法。精神状态对头了，失败就有可能成为胜利的起点。
    第三，一分为二看失败。暂时的失败中孕育着将来成功的因素。前面五百多次试验不是白做的，至少感性认识加深了，数据增多了，操作水平提高了，从本来的“一无所知”到现在的“有所了解”了。比起开始的时候，困难不是增多而是减少了，离胜利不是更远而是更近了。对待失败，重要的问题是：从失败中去发现成功的因素，寻找失败的原因，而不是全盘否定，失去信心。
    勇于实践　善于实践
    更重要的，他们懂得了，要探索到客观事物的规律，不仅要勇于实践，还要善于实践，善于运用辩证唯物主义方法。
    他们认真学习了毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》，并且对照着总结了自己的工作。他们发现，前一段实践之所以“走入迷宫”，主要是：试验做得虽多，但是缺乏“去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里”的周密的分析研究。在“多数矛盾存在”的情况下，没有“用全力找出它的主要矛盾”，有些眉毛胡子一把抓，结果就“如入五里雾中”。
    于是，他们就从分析主要矛盾着手，对试验中的温度、速度、浓度等一系列因素和数据，反复地进行比较和研究，进行再试验，终于进一步发现了影响反应的中心环节，并不在聚合这道工序本身。这给他们又上了重要的一课：“抓主要矛盾，也得破各种框框。开始试验时，我们没有一点框框。搞了五百多次试验，本钱有一点了，脑子里就有了框框，一心钻入聚合而无法自拔。破洋框框不容易，破自己的框框也不容易。”
    由于抓准了矛盾，集中力量围绕中心环节进行围攻，试验越做越顺利，眉目越来越清晰，真是“捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了”。当试验进行到第七百八十次时，第一瓶聚合体到手了。当试验进行到一千零五十次时，聚合体的质量更高更稳定了。
    科学实验也要有高度“敌情”观念
    接下去，就是纺丝。纺丝要有设备。设备哪里来？他们决定自力更生，土法上马。这群从没有搞过设计的青年，学起了设计。他们跑遍了全所大小仓库，寻找可以利用的旧废材料。在设计中注意利用原有的厂房、材料等条件，尽可能不花钱或少花钱。就这样边设计、边建造、边使用、边修改，只花了二千多元，以一个季度的时间，建造了一台从未见过的纺丝设备。
    这也不是一帆风顺的。土纺丝设备，他们一共搞过两台；前面讲的，已经是第二台了。当他们用第一台设备进行纺丝的时候，出了事故——设备坏了！
    有人议论：“土设备就是不灵嘛！还是想办法去进口一台来改装吧！”但是，他们对土设备的信念没有动摇，他们没有强调客观因素，而是首先从主观思想上严格检查，结果发现这次事故是可以防止的。原来他们也曾经估计到这个问题，因为有侥幸心理，并没有真正重视它，结果出了问题。
    他们狠狠抓住这个事件，严肃认真地讨论好多次，总结了“从严、从难”四个大字，把坏事变成了好事。他们说，科学问题不能有半点马虎，一定得老老实实。侥幸，就是不老老实实，就是有点马虎。破除迷信，解决了我们在战略上藐视困难的问题，但是我们在战术上重视困难不够，所以有时就失败，就出事故。在阶级斗争中，我们要有高度的敌情观念，科学实验中，我们也要有高度的“敌情”观念。
    为了胜利地打好纺丝这一仗，他们制订了严密的工作计划，订立了许多操作制度，一关一关都有专人负责把守，每一种可能都设想到，采取了预防的措施。每一个环节都反复地检查，每一次试验都有明确的目的，每一次预习都进行小结。就这样，第二台设备第一次试纺就获得了成功。丝，终于纺出来了。
    按照惯例，丝纺出来了，提高丝的强力，往往是列为一个单独的课题来进行研究的，花上一年半载也不算长。可是他们却提出了一个四十天攻下强力关的大胆的计划。这一阶段的试验，由于经过一年多来的实践、认识、再实践、再认识，他们的许多做法，都更自觉一些了。结果连他们自己也意想不到，竟以五天的时间，就攻下了这一关。
    新型的合成纤维在我国诞生了！红雷青年小组在这场赶超世界先进水平的斗争中获得了胜利。有人也许会问：在他们的斗争过程中，最可珍贵的是什么？是新型的合成纤维么？这当然可贵。但是最可珍贵的，是人的思想的变化，是人的成长，是毛泽东思想在这些青年的头脑中开始扎下了根！
