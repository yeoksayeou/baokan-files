    Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, I have six major gaps. In a word, I still lack the noble character cultivated by him with Mao Zedong Thought.
    In order to conquer the three scourges of waterlogging, wind, and sand, and salinization, and to change the face of Lankao County, Comrade Jiao Yulu, disregarding his serious illness, braved the severe cold in winter and waded through floods in summer, carried out a large amount of arduous and meticulous work, and excellently completed the tasks assigned by the Party. This is a concrete manifestation of Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and everything for the revolution.
    Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu's thinking and work, there is a great distance: my thought of serving the people is not as complete and thorough as Jiao Yulu's; my work style is not as in-depth and practical as Jiao Yulu's; my attitude towards the opinions of the masses is not as careful and patient as Jiao Yulu's; I am not as indomitable as Jiao Yulu in the face of difficulties; I am not as considerate and concerned about the sufferings of the poor and lower-middle peasants as Jiao Yulu; and my lifestyle is not as simple and frugal as Jiao Yulu's. In a word, I still lack the noble character cultivated by Comrade Jiao Yulu with Mao Zedong Thought – thinking of all the people in my heart, and only not thinking of myself. Therefore, in the future, I will take Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror, learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way with deep class feelings like him, regard studying Chairman Mao's books as the highest instruction for all work, be a completely and thoroughly revolutionary who serves the people, and work for the Party and the people in a down-to-earth manner.
    Changling is a place with plains, depressions, ridges, and sand dunes, and its natural conditions urgently need to be transformed. I and the main leading comrades of the county party committee are determined to immediately take Chairman Mao's works and luggage to the most difficult places, work hard with the commune members, quickly find out the laws of nature, draw up a blueprint for changing the face of Changling, and fight for three to five years to completely overcome natural disasters.

    心里装着毛泽东思想  心里装着全体人民
    我跟焦裕禄同志相比，有六大差距。一句话，还缺乏他那种用毛泽东思想培养的高尚品德。
    焦裕禄同志为了治服内涝、风沙、盐碱三害，改变兰考县的面貌，不顾自己身患重病，冬冒严寒，夏踏洪水，进行了大量艰苦细致的工作，出色地完成了党交给的任务。这是焦裕禄同志一心为革命、一切为革命精神的具体表现。
    我同焦裕禄同志的思想和工作比，是有很大距离的：为人民服务的思想没有焦裕禄那样完全、彻底；工作作风没有焦裕禄那样深入踏实；对待群众的意见没有焦裕禄那样细心耐心；在困难面前没有象焦裕禄那样百折不挠；对待贫农下中农的苦没有象焦裕禄那样体贴关心；生活作风没有焦裕禄那样艰苦朴素。一句话，还缺乏焦裕禄同志那种用毛泽东思想培养的高尚品德——心里装着全体人民、唯独没有自己。因此，我今后要以焦裕禄同志作一面镜子，象他那样带着深厚的阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作，把学习毛主席的书当作一切工作的最高指示，做一个完全彻底的为人民服务的革命者，踏踏实实为党为人民工作。
    长岭是一个平、洼、岗、沙丘地兼有的地方，自然条件迫切需要改造。我和县委主要领导同志决心立即带上毛主席著作和行李，到最艰苦的地方去，和社员一起大干苦干，尽快地摸清自然规律，订出改变长岭面貌的蓝图，奋战三年五载，彻底战胜自然灾害。
    中共吉林长岭县委副书记  刘汉涛
