    South Vietnamese "Liberation Army News" Hails the Glorious Victory of the Unification of the Southern People's Armed Forces Over the Past Five Years
    South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces Develop into a Powerful Heroic Army
    Determined to Advance Triumphantly, Defeat U.S. Imperialism, Liberate the South, and Unify the Motherland
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 12th (via telegram) According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces' newspaper, "Liberation Army News," published an editorial stating that no matter how many troops U.S. imperialism sends, no matter where it expands the war to, and no matter what cruel methods it uses, the South Vietnamese military and civilians will bravely advance and strive for complete victory.
    This editorial was published to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the unification of the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces (February 15th). The title of the editorial is "We Have Already Won, We Will Certainly Win Completely."
    The editorial stated that the past five years have been five years of rapid growth, glorious achievements, and heroic feats for the heroic people and Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, and five years in which their revolutionary heroism has shone brightly.
    The editorial said that before 1961, in order to resist the bloody suppression and attacks of the American bandits and their running dogs, and to defend their right to live, people in various parts of South Vietnam organized self-defense groups, guerrilla teams, or other armed units. From the very beginning, these organizations were the people's revolutionary armed forces. In order to meet the needs of the revolutionary situation and further defeat the United States and its running dogs, on February 15, 1961, the South Vietnam National Liberation Front unified the various people's armed units into the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces.
    The editorial said that since then, the Liberation Armed Forces have overcome numerous difficulties and made leaps and bounds. From some scattered armed units, it has developed into a people's army with centralized leadership and unified command. It seized the enemy's weapons to attack the enemy and became a powerful army capable of defeating the enemy's various modern weapons.
    The editorial said that five years of combat have been five years of victory. The revolutionary armed forces of South Vietnam have defeated 500,000 puppet troops equipped and trained by the United States and are currently defeating 700,000 U.S. and puppet troops covered by thousands of various types of aircraft, tanks, and artillery, annihilating dozens of enemy battalions, and routing them from the mountains to the plains and cities, from the front lines to the enemy's rear.
    The editorial said that at present, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are stubbornly and brutally continuing to strengthen and expand the war of aggression. Under the leadership of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, the South Vietnamese people are continuing to carry out fierce battles to win genuine independence and peace, liberate the South, defend the North, and then peacefully reunify the motherland. As the sons and daughters of the people, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces are more aware than ever of the current revolutionary tasks of the South Vietnamese people, aware of their own combat goals, determined to fight, advance bravely on the road to victory, wholeheartedly loyal to the motherland and the people, complete all tasks, overcome all difficulties, and strive for final victory.

    南越《解放军报》欢呼南方人民武装统一五年来的辉煌胜利
    南越解放武装力量发展为强大的英雄军队
    决心乘胜前进打败美帝解放南方统一祖国
    新华社河内十二日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量机关报《解放军报》发表社论说，不管美帝国主义增派多少军队，不管它把战争扩大到什么地方和使用什么样的残暴手段，越南南方军民也要英勇前进，争取全胜。
    这篇社论是为了庆祝越南南方解放武装力量统一五周年（二月十五日）发表的。社论的题目是《我们已经胜利，我们一定全胜》。
    社论说，过去的五年，是英雄的越南南方人民和解放武装力量迅速成长、充满辉煌战功和英雄业绩的五年，是他们的革命英雄主义大放光彩的五年。
    社论说，在一九六一年以前，为了抵抗美国强盗及其走狗血腥的镇压和进攻，保卫自己的生活权利，南越各地人民组织了自卫组、游击队或其他武装单位。这些组织一开始就是人民的革命武装队伍。为了适应革命形势的需要和进一步击败美国及其走狗，一九六一年二月十五日，越南南方民族解放阵线把各个人民武装单位统一组成越南南方解放武装力量。
    社论说，从此，解放武装力量克服了重重困难，飞跃前进。从一些零星的武装单位，发展成为具有集中领导和统一指挥的人民军队。它夺取敌人的武器来打击敌人，并且成为一支能够击败敌人的各种现代化武器的强大军队。
    社论说，战斗的五年是胜利的五年。越南南方的革命武装力量击败了得到美国装备和训练的五十万伪军，目前正在击败获得数以千计的各种类型的飞机、坦克和大炮掩护的七十万美、伪军，歼灭敌军数十个营，从山区到平原和城市，从前线到敌人的后方，把它们打得落花流水。
    社论说，目前，美帝国主义及其走狗正在顽固和残暴地继续加强和扩大侵略战争，在越南南方民族解放阵线领导下的南越人民正在继续进行争取真正的独立与和平、解放南方、保卫北方、进而和平统一祖国的激烈战斗。作为人民的子弟兵，越南南方解放武装力量比任何时候都更加认清南越人民目前的革命任务，认清自己的战斗目标，决心战斗，在胜利道路上英勇前进，全心全意忠于祖国、忠于人民，完成一切任务，克服一切困难，争取最后胜利。
