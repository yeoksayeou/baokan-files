　　Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, February 22nd: The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) newspaper "Vanguard" recently published an article stating that the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong receive genuine support from oppressed people worldwide, which greatly disturbs U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionists. They are cooperating with each other to launch a rampant anti-China movement.
    The "Vanguard" published an article titled "Anti-China Movement is Rampant" in the fourth issue of its third volume in February, saying, "An unprecedentedly rampant anti-China movement is taking place worldwide. U.S. imperialists say China is their number one enemy. They have deployed their main armed forces around China. They never cease their anti-China propaganda... All over the world, their lackeys have also started the same clamor."
    The article points out, "Soviet revisionists are conducting their anti-China movement as rampantly as U.S. imperialists. They are conducting their anti-China movement under the guise of communist vocabulary. Therefore, this is a dirtier movement, but it is the same movement. No one can deny that these movements are consistent. They are closely coordinated."
    The article points out, "Soviet leaders have assured U.S. imperialists that they will end the Vietnam War. They have discussed this issue with Humphrey, Harriman, and others. However, Soviet revisionists have undertaken an impossible task, and their failure makes them furious. Therefore, they are even more furious at China."
    The article emphasizes that Soviet revisionists are vigorously opposing China because they have been challenged. "This challenge is that all oppressed people around the world express tremendous genuine support from the bottom of their hearts for the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party, and its leader Mao Zedong."

　　澳共（马列主义者）机关报《先锋报》说
　　中国得到全世界被压迫人民支持
　　美苏严重不安加紧勾结猖狂反华
    新华社二十二日讯  墨尔本消息：澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》最近发表文章指出，中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东得到全世界被压迫人民的真正支持，这使得美帝国主义和苏联修正主义者严重不安，它们正互相配合，掀起一个猖狂的反华运动。
    《先锋报》在二月间出版的第三卷第四期里刊载一篇题为《反华运动正在猖狂进行》的文章说，“空前猖狂的反华运动正在全世界进行。美帝国主义者说中国是他们的头号敌人。他们把自己的主要的武装部队部署在中国周围。他们一刻也不停止反华宣传……在全世界，他们的走狗也掀起了同样的叫嚷。”
    文章指出，“苏联修正主义者跟美帝国主义者一样猖狂地进行他们的反华运动。他们在共产主义语汇的掩饰下进行他们的反华运动。因此，这是更加肮脏的运动，但是这是同样的运动。谁都不能否认这些运动是一致的。它们是紧密配合的。”
    文章指出，“苏联领导人已经向美帝国主义者保证，要结束越南战争。他们同汉弗莱、哈里曼等人都讨论了这个问题。但是，苏联修正主义者承担了一个办不到的任务，而他们的失败使他们愤怒欲狂。因此，他们更加对中国大发雷霆。”
    文章着重指出，苏联修正主义者大肆反华是因为他们遭到了挑战。“这个挑战就是，全世界一切被压迫人民从内心对中华人民共和国、对中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东表示巨大的真正支持。”
