    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 2nd -- Cangxian County, Hebei Province, having grasped the local natural laws, achieved a bumper sorghum harvest in 1965 by planting sorghum appropriately according to local conditions, transforming itself from a long-term grain-deficient county into a grain-surplus county.

    Last year, Cangxian planted more than 473,000 mu of sorghum, accounting for 35.2% of the autumn-harvested crop planting area. The average yield per mu was more than double the highest yield in local history. Due to the large-scale and significant increase in sorghum production, the county's total grain output increased by nearly 1.6 times compared to 1964.

    Cangxian's production practice proves that sorghum is capable of high yields and is not a low-yield crop. Last year, the sorghum planted in the county yielded an average of 500-600 jin per mu in some plots, and more than 700 jin per mu in others. Sorghum is both drought-resistant and waterlogging-resistant, as well as tolerant of saline-alkali conditions. Last year, Cangxian experienced a severe drought, and some other crops yielded little, while sorghum had a bumper harvest.

    Cangxian County, located near the Bohai Sea, has a low-lying terrain. The county has 1.49 million mu of cultivated land, of which 60% is low-lying saline-alkali land. Rainfall is concentrated in July and August, often causing spring droughts and autumn floods, with flooded areas sometimes exceeding 800,000 mu per year. Due to the harm caused by drought, floods, and saline-alkali conditions, crop yields have been very low, and the county has historically relied on the state to supply a portion of its food grain.

    According to the analysis of Cangxian's leading organs, the low yield of food crops in Cangxian has its objective reasons, but from a subjective perspective, it is due to the failure to understand natural laws, actively transform nature, and adapt to nature by planting crops according to local conditions. Some communes and teams did not pay attention to natural characteristics and historical planting habits, and once one-sidedly emphasized planting rice and corn, at one point regarding sorghum as a low-yield crop and unwilling to plant it. Last spring, after the Socialist Education Movement, the broad masses of cadres and commune members in Cangxian County raised their awareness, vigorously exposed the backwardness in production, and tapped the potential for production. In addition to carrying out basic farmland construction, they also mobilized the masses to discuss the issue of planting according to local conditions. The masses advocated planting more sorghum. Some said: Cangxian is suitable for planting sorghum. The main reason for continuous grain shortages in the past was that too little sorghum was planted. Planting more sorghum can guarantee against major disasters. Some said: In the past, sorghum always protected us from floods and droughts. As long as we cultivate carefully, sorghum can achieve high yields. After repeated discussions among the masses, the county implemented a sorghum planting area of more than 470,000 mu (of which 140,000 mu was cultivated land with better soil quality), exceeding the original plan by more than 70,000 mu.

    In last year's development of sorghum production, Cangxian County strived to solve problems such as seeds, close planting, fertilization, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. In the past, the county's sorghum varieties had deteriorated and become mixed, generally yielding 50-60 jin per mu in normal years, and no more than 100 jin per mu in good years. Last year, more than a dozen improved sorghum varieties were introduced, such as "Xiongyue 253," "Branching Big Red Ear," and "Eight Leaves Even," and the planting area of improved sorghum varieties reached 250,000 mu (accounting for 52% of the county's sorghum planting area). And according to the adaptability of different varieties, planting according to local conditions - early-maturing, flood-resistant varieties such as "Eight Leaves Even" were planted in waterlogged low-lying land and jujube tree areas, alkali-resistant and barren-tolerant varieties such as multi-ear sorghum were planted in saline-alkali land, and water-loving and fertilizer-loving varieties such as "Branching Big Red Ear" and "Xiongyue 253" were planted in high land. Under the same conditions, these improved varieties yielded one to three times more than local varieties. The highest yield per mu reached 600-700 jin.

    In order to adapt to the natural situation of spring drought and summer floods, last year Cangxian's sorghum was appropriately sown earlier, generally 7 to 10 days earlier than in previous years. Communes and teams also paid attention to applying more fertilizer and implementing reasonable close planting, and these measures all achieved significant yield increases.

    Although Cangxian's sorghum achieved a bumper harvest last year, the average yield per unit area in the county is still relatively low, the planting area of improved varieties is not large, cultivation is not meticulous enough, plants are sparse, and many sorghum fields are fertilized less or not at all. The county's leadership at all levels is determined to earnestly solve these problems this year and strive for a greater sorghum harvest.

### 摸清自然规律　既适应自然又改造自然  沧县高粱丰收变缺粮为余粮

    摸清自然规律　既适应自然又改造自然
    沧县高粱丰收变缺粮为余粮
    新华社天津二日电　河北省沧县摸清当地自然规律，在一九六五年因地制宜大种高粱获得丰收，一下子由长期缺粮县变为余粮县。
    去年，沧县种了四十七万三千多亩高粱，占秋熟作物播种面积百分之三十五点二，平均每亩产量比当地历史上最高产量高一倍多。由于高粱大面积大幅度增产，全县粮食总产量比一九六四年增加了将近一点六倍。
    沧县的生产实践证明，高粱能够高产，不是低产作物。去年这个县种的高粱，有些地块平均亩产五六百斤，有的亩产七百斤以上。高粱既耐涝耐旱又耐盐碱。去年沧县大旱，其它作物有些收成无几，而高粱却丰收了。
    沧县，靠近渤海，地势低洼。全县有耕地一百四十九万亩，低洼盐碱地占百分之六十。降雨集中在七、八月份，经常是春旱秋涝，涝地面积有时一年在八十万亩以上。由于旱涝盐碱为害，农作物产量很低，历来要靠国家供应一部分口粮。
    据沧县领导机关分析，沧县粮食作物产量之所以低，固然有其客观原因，而从主观方面讲，则是由于还没有摸清自然规律，积极改造自然和适应自然，因地种植。有些社队不注意自然特点和历史种植习惯，曾经片面地强调多种水稻、玉米，一度把高粱当低产作物，不愿种它。去年春天，经过社会主义教育运动，沧县广大干部和社员提高了觉悟，大揭生产落后盖子，挖掘生产潜力；除了进行农田基本建设以外，还发动群众讨论因地种植问题。群众主张多种高粱。有的说：沧县适宜种高粱，过去连年缺粮，主要原因是高粱种得太少了。多种高粱，可以保证不受大灾。有的说：过去遇涝遇旱，都是高粱保驾。只要精耕细作，高粱能够高产。经过群众反复讨论，全县落实了高粱播种面积四十七万多亩（其中土质较好的耕地占十四万亩），超过原定计划七万多亩。
    沧县在去年发展高粱生产中，努力解决种子、密植、施肥和防治病虫害等问题。过去，这个县的高粱品种退化混杂，一般年头亩产五六十斤，好年景亩产量也不过百斤。去年引进了“熊岳二五三”、“分枝大红穗”、“八叶齐”等十几个高粱优良品种，良种高粱播种面积达到二十五万亩（占全县高粱播种面积百分之五十二）；并且根据不同品种的适应性，因地种植——易涝的洼淀地和枣树区种植了“八叶齐”等早熟耐涝的品种，盐碱地种植了多穗高粱等抗碱耐瘠的品种，高地种植了喜水喜肥的“分枝大红穗”、“熊岳二五三”等品种。这些优良品种，在同样条件下，比当地品种都增产了一倍到三倍。亩产最高的达六七百斤。
    为了适应春旱夏涝这一自然情况，去年沧县的高粱都是适当早播的，播期一般比往年提前七天到十天。各社、队还注意多施肥和实行合理密植，这些措施都收到了显著的增产效果。
    沧县的高粱虽然去年获得了丰收，但是全县平均单位面积产量还比较低，良种播种面积不大，耕作不够精细，植株偏稀，有不少高粱地施肥少甚至没有施肥。这个县的各级领导部门决心要在今年认真解决这些问题，争取高粱更大丰收。
