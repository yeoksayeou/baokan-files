    Comrade Mao Zedong said: “All comrades in the Party must fully estimate and prepare to overcome all difficulties with unwavering perseverance and in a planned way."
    Engaging in agricultural production is a struggle to extract material wealth from nature. In this struggle, neither the entire process nor each stage or link will be smooth sailing or a straight path. We will inevitably encounter many difficulties of one kind or another, and in particular, we may be subject to various natural disasters. As the county Party committee, the core leadership of the county, its attitude toward difficulties has a role in influencing the overall situation. If the county Party committee adopts a revolutionary spirit of daring to be the master of nature, a heroic spirit of “The Red Army fears not the trials of a long march, holding light ten thousand crags and torrents," both despising and valuing the difficulties at hand, standing firm, maintaining confidence in victory, and daring to lead, daring to struggle, and daring to win, then it will inspire the revolutionary spirit of the people throughout the county, thereby transforming spirit into matter, creating various methods and measures to overcome difficulties, and enabling us to overcome difficulties, win victories, and achieve bumper harvests. Conversely, if the county Party committee is content to be the slave of nature, fearing difficulties when they arise, lacking the fighting spirit of daring to "break through" and "fight," and losing confidence in victory, then it will seriously limit or even dampen the courage and determination of the people throughout the county to overcome difficulties, preventing difficulties that could be overcome through human effort from being overcome, and causing the development of agricultural production to suffer undue impact.
    Judging from the natural conditions of our county, they are many times better than those of Dazhai, and no worse than those of our neighboring county, Zunhua. Historically, grain yields have also been higher than those of Dazhai and Zunhua. Why are we now lagging far behind them? The main reason is that the county Party committee, especially myself, lacked the revolutionary spirit of vowing to be the master of nature in the past. We did not dominate nature with a revolutionary spirit, but passively accepted the domination and limitations of nature. We did not lead the broad masses to wage a tenacious struggle against nature to change production conditions with a fearless revolutionary spirit, but led socialist large-scale agricultural production with the ideology of a small-scale peasant economy. The twenty-four solar terms of the year forced us to be busy and laborious, expending effort and sweat, but with little effect. Especially in the face of certain natural disasters, we were often powerless, at their mercy, thereby putting our work in a passive situation and our production in a backward state.
    In the winter of 1964, when the county Party committee summarized its work, it used the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai as a mirror to examine its thinking and the experience of Zunhua as a ruler to measure its actions. The county Party committee realized that the reason we lacked the ambition to harness nature, transform nature, and struggle against nature was mainly due to a lack of vigorous revolutionary will, full revolutionary enthusiasm, and a revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win. The root cause was that the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought was not held high enough, and the red banner of the General Line was not held high enough. Engaging in revolution and fighting nature without adhering to the command of Mao Zedong Thought and without holding high the banner of the General Line could only lead to inaction.
    Once the gap was found, understanding was enhanced, thinking was clarified, and revolutionary enthusiasm increased. In order to transform nature, conquer nature, and change production conditions, the county Party committee led the people of the entire county in a major battle against mountains, a major battle against low-lying areas, and a major battle against plains. In the mountainous areas of the county, 80,000 mu of terraced fields were renovated, including 16,000 mu of high-standard horizontal terraced fields. In the low-lying areas, 8,000 mu of platform fields were built, and more than 1,000 drainage ditches were dug (2.5 million cubic meters of earthwork), and three drainage stations were built. In the plains, 150,000 mu of garden fields were built. Last year, our county encountered a historically rare long-term drought with more than 270 days without significant rainfall, as well as serious natural disasters of three windstorms, three hailstorms, and one insect plague. The disaster area reached 950,000 mu, accounting for 73% of the total cultivated area. 180,000 mu of corn and sorghum that had already tasseled and formed ears were smashed to pieces by hail, of which 50,000 mu were completely flattened. In the face of successive disasters, the county Party committee did not panic, lose its bearings, or waver pessimistically. It always followed Chairman Mao's teaching of despising difficulties strategically and valuing difficulties tactically, leading the broad masses of cadres and people in the struggle against disaster. When a serious spring drought occurred, we issued the call to "not wait for rain, not rely on heaven, resolutely defeat the drought, and ensure timely sowing." When a summer drought occurred, we issued the call to "use the energy of drought-resistant sowing to go all out to fight drought and protect seedlings." When hit by wind and hail, we issued the call to "mobilize the entire Party and the entire people, work hard and fight to overcome all difficulties, establish revolutionary ambitions, and resolutely cross the 'Yellow River' pass," and "turn severe disasters into mild disasters, reduce the impact of mild disasters on production, and achieve a large increase in production where there are no disasters." When armyworms occurred on a large scale, we issued the call to "mobilize the entire people, fight day and night, and seize grain from the mouths of insects." Every time a disaster occurred, the county Party committee personally went deep into the severely affected communes and teams, mobilized the masses, and took the lead in hard work. In the face of natural disasters, although some cadres and people had pessimistic sentiments, they were promptly corrected, their spirits were boosted, and they waged an indomitable struggle against various natural disasters with a spirit of fearing neither heaven nor earth. During the drought-resistant sowing, more than 100,000 people in the county were mobilized to carry water to plant more than 400,000 mu of various crops. In the struggle to fight drought and protect seedlings, water was carried to irrigate 200,000 mu of land. In the struggle against wind and hail, more than 80,000 mu of land were replanted and supplemented after several days of continuous fighting.
    A year of tireless, hard, and practical work turned a year of multiple and severe disasters into a year of bumper harvest, and grain production crossed the "Yellow River."
    Practice has once again told us that whether to be the master of nature or the slave of nature in the struggle for agricultural production is an important indicator for testing whether the county Party committee is ideologically revolutionized, and it is also a key to whether a large-scale agricultural harvest can be achieved. As long as we hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dare to lead, dare to struggle, and dare to win, we can achieve relatively outstanding results even in extremely difficult situations with multiple disasters. Therefore, we will better study Chairman Mao's works, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and transform ourselves so that our thinking and style will further adapt to the requirements of the great revolution and great leap forward, and make better achievements in the struggle against nature.

    做自然的主人，不做自然的奴隶
    河北省丰润县委代理书记　彭砚章
    毛主席说：“全党同志都必须充分地估计到，并准备用百折不回的毅力，有计划地克服所有的困难。”
    进行农业生产斗争，就是向自然界索取物质财富的斗争。在这场斗争中，不论其整个过程，还是每一阶段、每一环节，都没有一帆风顺、平坦笔直的道路，都必然会遇到许许多多这样或那样的困难，尤其是可能受到各种自然灾害的侵袭。作为全县领导核心的县委，在各种困难面前持什么态度，具有左右全局的作用。如果县委是以敢于当大自然的主人的革命精神，以“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲”的英雄气概，对当头的困难既藐视，又重视，顶的住，站的稳，坚定必胜信心，敢于领导，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，那么，就会鼓舞全县人民的革命气势，进而使精神变物质，创造各种克服困难的办法和措施，就能战胜困难，赢得胜利，夺得丰收。反之，如果县委甘当大自然的奴隶，困难当头先害怕，缺乏敢“闯”敢“拼”的战斗精神，丧失必胜的信心，那么，就会严重地限制甚至打击全县人民战胜困难的勇气和决心，使那些通过人的努力可以克服的困难得不到克服，使农业生产的发展受到不应有的影响。
    从我们县的自然条件看，要比大寨好多少倍，也不比我们邻县遵化差，历史上的粮食产量，也曾比大寨和遵化高，为什么现在却远远落在他们的后头呢？主要是县委特别是我，过去缺乏誓做自然主人的革命精神。我们不是以革命的精神去主宰自然，而是被动地受着自然的支配和限制，不是以大无畏的革命精神领导广大群众向自然进行顽强搏斗，改变生产条件，而是以小农经济的思想领导社会主义大农业生产。一年二十四个节令逼得我们忙忙碌碌，费了力，流了汗，收效不大。特别是在某些自然灾害面前，往往是无能为力，任其摆布，因而使工作陷于被动局面，使生产处于落后状态。
    一九六四年冬天，县委在总结工作时，以大寨的革命精神为镜子照了思想，以遵化的经验做尺子量了行动。县委认识到，我们之所以缺乏驾驭自然，改造自然，斗天斗地的雄心壮志，主要是缺乏旺盛的革命意志、饱满的革命热情和敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神。究其原因，是毛泽东思想红旗举得不高，总路线红旗举得不高。搞革命，斗自然，不坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，不高高举起总路线大旗，就只能是无所作为。
    差距找到了，认识提高了，思想明确了，革命的劲头也就大了。为了改造自然，征服自然，改变生产条件，县委带领全县人民大战山地，大战洼地，大战平原。全县山区整修梯田八万亩，其中建高标准水平梯田一万六千亩。洼地挑台田八千亩，挖泄水沟一千多条（土方二百五十万立方米），建排水站三座。平原建成园田十五万亩。去年我们县遇到了历史上罕见的二百七十多天没下透雨的长期大旱，和三次风灾、三次雹灾、一次虫灾的严重的自然灾害。受灾面积达九十五万亩，占总耕地面积的百分之七十三。有十八万亩已经吐穗甩棒的玉米和扬花的高粱被冰雹砸个稀烂，其中有五万亩砸个土平。在历次灾害面前，县委没有惊慌失措、悲观动摇，始终遵循毛主席关于在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难的教导，带领广大干部和群众进行抗灾斗争。在发生严重春旱的时候，我们发出了“不等雨，不靠天，坚决战胜干旱，保证适时播种”的号召；在发生夏旱的时候，发出了“以抗旱播种的劲头，全力抗旱保苗”的号召；在受到风雹袭击的时候，又发出了“全党全民总动员，艰苦奋战排万难，立下革命雄心志，坚决闯过‘黄河’关”和“重灾变轻灾，轻灾不减产，无灾大超产”的号召；大面积发生粘虫时，又发出了“全民总动员，昼夜奋战，从虫嘴夺粮”的号召。每遇一次灾害，县委都亲自深入重灾社、队，发动群众，带头苦干。在自然灾害面前，虽然有些干部和群众产生过悲观情绪，也都得到了及时纠正，振作了精神，以天不怕、地不怕的气魄，向各种自然灾害进行百折不挠的斗争。在抗旱播种时，全县出动十几万人担水点种各种作物四十多万亩。在抗旱保苗斗争中，担水浇地二十万亩。在抗风雹斗争中，经过几天的连续战斗，翻种和补种八万多亩。
    一年的穷干、苦干、实干，使灾多灾重之年变成了丰收年，粮食产量跨过了“黄河”。
    实践再一次告诉我们，在农业生产斗争中是当自然的主人，还是做自然的奴隶，是检验县委是否思想革命化的一个重要标志，也是能否夺取农业大丰收的重要关键。只要高举毛泽东思想红旗，敢于领导、敢于斗争、敢于胜利，就是在多灾多难的极端困难的情况下，也能创出比较优异的成绩。因此，我们将更好地学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己，改造自己，使我们的思想和作风，进一步适应大革命、大跃进形势的要求，在向自然斗争中做出更好的成绩。
