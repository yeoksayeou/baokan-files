    The CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau and East China Bureau require Party members and cadres to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu to transform their thinking and improve their work
    The Political Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the CCP Central Committee
    Requires all levels of agricultural and forestry political departments to, under the leadership of local Party committees, treat the activity of learning from Jiao Yulu as an important part of highlighting politics.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 10th: The Political Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the CCP Central Committee today issued a notice on learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, the former Secretary of the Lankao County Party Committee. The full text is as follows:
    The glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, former Secretary of the Lankao County Party Committee in Henan Province, are being widely spread on all fronts across the country. With his immortal life, Comrade Jiao Yulu has set a shining example for leading cadres in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and wholeheartedly serving the people. His exemplary deeds and immortal revolutionary spirit have become a great force inspiring people to carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction. Comrade Jiao Yulu is a good Party member of our Party, a good cadre of the people, and a good student of Chairman Mao. He is not only a good example for county Party secretaries, but also a good example for the vast number of Party members and cadres, especially leading cadres, on our agricultural front to learn from. The vast number of Party members and cadres on our agricultural front must immediately launch a wave of learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu.
    Learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu is of great significance. Since liberation, China's agriculture has made great progress under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, but from an overall perspective, the foundation is still relatively weak, and the level of production is not high enough. In order to rapidly change this situation, the vast number of masses and cadres on China's agricultural front are, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on developing agriculture by relying on Dazhai, relying on the Party's policies, and relying on the enthusiasm of 500 million peasants, further developing the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance to wage war against nature. And learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds and revolutionary spirit will add new strength to us in this great struggle and win new victories.
    In learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, we should:
    1. Like Comrade Jiao Yulu, be a good student of Chairman Mao, put Mao Zedong Thought in command everywhere, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our own stand, viewpoint, and method to do a good job in revolutionary work. Comrade Jiao Yulu is a model for specifically applying Mao Zedong Thought to solve practical problems in thought and work. All our Party members and cadres, especially responsible cadres, must take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, seriously read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Through learning, we must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher on the agricultural front, and promote the sustained and healthy development of the upsurge in agricultural production and construction.
    2. Like Comrade Jiao Yulu, establish a world outlook of serving the revolution wholeheartedly, serving the revolution in everything, and serving the people wholeheartedly. Although Comrade Jiao Yulu suffered from a serious illness, he still devoted himself to his work. Wherever there were difficulties, he went there. He was infinitely loyal to the revolution. In learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, we must learn from his noble quality of benefiting others without any thought of self-interest, and devoting himself to the revolution and the people until his last breath, further promoting our ideological revolutionization and becoming firm and thorough proletarian revolutionaries.
    3. Like Comrade Jiao Yulu, establish great ambitions, set lofty goals, dare to struggle, dare to win, overcome difficulties, and start a business arduously. Lankao County is an area with poor natural conditions and very serious disasters. Comrade Jiao Yulu led the cadres and masses of the entire county to wage a tenacious struggle against natural disasters and achieved major victories. He is a model for us on the agricultural front to lead the masses to march towards nature and carry out the struggle to transform heaven and earth. Through learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, we must make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress in the struggle against nature.
    4. Like Comrade Jiao Yulu, establish a revolutionary style of integrating theory with practice, closely linking with the masses, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and conscientiously implementing collective leadership. Comrade Jiao Yulu adhered to the principle of collective leadership, fully promoted democracy, personally led cadres to visit poor and ask about suffering, and was good at uniting comrades, which won the great trust of the vast number of cadres and masses and made great contributions to the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Through learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, Party members and cadres on our agricultural front must realize the revolutionization of work style, improve work efficiency, and every comrade must strive to be a good cadre like Jiao Yulu, so that our work can adapt to the developing situation of the three great revolutionary movements.
    All levels of agricultural and forestry political departments must, under the leadership of local Party committees, treat the activity of learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu as an important part of highlighting politics, use various propaganda tools, adopt various methods, widely publicize Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds and revolutionary spirit, and conscientiously organize Party members and cadres to discuss, raise awareness, and improve work, so that the activity of learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu can truly be implemented.
    All enterprises and institutions on the agricultural front must hold special meetings, mobilize the vast number of Party members and cadres, take Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror, and, in light of their thinking and work, conduct comparison and examination, find shortcomings, and formulate measures to strive for the realization of the ideological revolutionization and work style revolutionization of Party members and cadres and promote the development of agricultural production and construction.

    The Central-South Bureau of the CCP Central Committee
    Requires that, in the near future, learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu be regarded as an important part of the movement to study Chairman Mao's works.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 10th: The Central-South Bureau of the CCP Central Committee issued a notice on the 9th, requiring all Party members and cadres to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu. The full text of the notice is as follows:
    Comrade Jiao Yulu, former Secretary of the Lankao County Party Committee in Henan Province, is a strong proletarian revolutionary fighter who has grown up rapidly under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. The Mao Zedong era is an era of heroic figures emerging in large numbers, and Comrade Jiao Yulu is such an outstanding heroic model. As a county Party secretary, Comrade Jiao Yulu is good at arming his own thinking and guiding his work with Mao Zedong Thought, and combining Chairman Mao's instructions with the actual situation of his work area, Lankao County, resolutely taking the mass line in revolutionary practice, going deep among the masses, learning from the masses, and leading the masses forward. Comrade Jiao Yulu has the noble qualities of the proletariat who does not seek fame or profit, is not afraid of hardship or death, is wholeheartedly for the revolution, and everything for the people, and also has a serious and earnest scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts. He has made a good combination of the proletariat's fearless revolutionary spirit and a solid work style. Comrade Jiao Yulu is worthy of being a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong, and worthy of being a shining example in China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    At present, the Central-South region, like the rest of the country, is in an excellent situation. However, the development of our work is unbalanced. In rural areas, and in other areas of work, some counties, districts, and departments have not caught up. There are still some areas that have suffered serious natural disasters, and arduous struggles must be carried out to completely change their face; the potential for industrial and agricultural development is still very large, and there is much to be done in other areas as well. In order to successfully achieve the third Five-Year Plan of great historical significance, and in order to comprehensively promote the work of the Central-South region, we require all Party members and cadres to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, take him as an example, and like him, with deep class feelings, study Chairman Mao's works at all times and in all matters, and take Chairman Mao's instructions as the highest criterion in every word and deed; learn from his attitude of seeking truth from facts, with a selfless revolutionary spirit, to carry out resolute, sustained, and effective struggle against all difficulties and obstacles, and all erroneous ideas.
    The Central-South Bureau requires that, in the near future, learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu be regarded as an important part of the movement to study Chairman Mao's works. All Party comrades must take the People's Daily article "A Model for County Party Secretaries - Jiao Yulu" published on February 7th, and the People's Daily editorial "Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, a Good Student of Comrade Mao Zedong," "We Need More Good Cadres Like This," and related documents as the main learning materials.
    The Central-South Bureau requires that Party cadres at and above the county level must adopt the method of rectification and study, that is, the method of integrating theory with practice, take Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror, strictly examine their own thinking, examine the work of their own region and unit, find the gap with Comrade Jiao Yulu, especially to find the gap in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and take effective measures to narrow the gap and catch up. In some units that are carrying out a major debate on the relationship between politics and professional work, the major debate should be linked to the example of Lankao County, learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's brilliant example of highlighting politics, grasping living ideas, and using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, and thoroughly criticize the eclectic tendency of emphasizing professional work over politics or placing politics and professional work on an equal footing. For Party members with low cultural levels, the relevant materials of Comrade Jiao Yulu should be used to give them Party lessons. In the study, it is required to compare one's own thinking, improve class consciousness, especially to improve the consciousness of studying Chairman Mao's works.
    We believe that, with Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, in the in-depth development of the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, more Jiao Yulu-style leading cadres will be rapidly cultivated. As long as our Party leading cadres can treat the revolutionary cause of the Party and the people with infinite loyalty like Comrade Jiao Yulu, our work will definitely be done more brilliantly.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary practice once again proves that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat power. Lankao County was originally an area with extremely harsh natural conditions. Under the leadership of Comrade Jiao Yulu, in a short period of time, great achievements were made in transforming the natural landscape. The conditions in many of our regions are much better than those in Lankao, and we should especially change our face completely faster. The fundamental problem here is: whether we truly use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our leadership "team," and whether we use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the vast number of cadres and masses. It can be fully predicted that as long as we deeply develop the movement to study Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to educate the entire Party, all cadres, and the vast number of masses, our cause will surely advance by leaps and bounds.

    The East China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee
    Requires all Party members and cadres, especially leading cadres at and above the county level, to take Jiao Yulu as an example to realize ideological revolutionization and leadership revolutionization.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 10th: The East China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee today issued a notice calling on all Party members and cadres in the East China region, especially leading cadres at and above the county level, to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu.
    The notice said that Comrade Jiao Yulu is a good Party member of our Party, a great communist fighter, a good student of Chairman Mao, a good example for county Party secretaries, and also a good example for leading cadres in all walks of life. He has the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, does not seek fame or profit, is not afraid of hardship or death, is wholeheartedly for the revolution, and everything for the people. He always maintains the true qualities of the working people, has deep class feelings for the masses, and shares weal and woe and common destiny with the masses in the most difficult environment. He plunges into reality selflessly, investigates and studies, mobilizes the masses, relies on the masses, learns from the masses, and struggles with the masses. He always adheres to highlighting politics, grasps the revolutionization of leading organs, is good at being the "squad leader," is good at uniting comrades, and is a model executor of the Party's democratic centralism.
    The notice requires all Party members and cadres in the entire region, especially leading cadres at and above the county level, to take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, transform their thinking, improve their work, and strive to realize ideological revolutionization and leadership revolutionization. They should all be like him, infinitely loyal to the Party and the people, forever follow Chairman Mao, forever be with the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and other working people, bravely go to the most difficult places to shoulder the heavy burden of the three great revolutions, and use the spirit of "not achieving the goal, I will not rest in peace," do everything possible to unite the masses, and use the great weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to overcome difficulties and win victories, and truly become revolutionaries who serve the entire Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly. The East China Bureau hopes that, through learning and practice, a group of good Party members, good cadres, and good mass leaders like Jiao Yulu can appear in the provinces and cities of East China and in all departments in the near future.

    培养更多的焦裕禄式的好党员好干部
    中共中央农林政治部号召农业战线广大党员和干部掀起学习焦裕禄的热潮
    中共中央中南局华东局要求党员和干部学习焦裕禄同志改造思想改进工作
    中共中央农林政治部
    要求各级农林政治部在各地党委领导下，把学习焦裕禄的活动当做突出政治的一项重要内容来抓。
    新华社十日讯　中共中央农林政治部今天发出关于向焦裕禄同志学习的通知，全文如下：
    河南省兰考县前任县委书记焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹，正在全国各个战线上广泛传播。焦裕禄同志以自己不朽的一生，为我们树立了一个领导干部活学活用毛主席著作、全心全意为人民服务的光辉榜样，他的模范事迹和不朽的革命精神，已成为鼓舞人们进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的巨大力量。焦裕禄同志是我们党的好党员，人民的好干部，毛主席的好学生。他不仅是县委书记的好榜样，也是我们农业战线上广大党员、干部，特别是领导干部学习的好榜样。我们农业战线上的广大党员、干部，要立即掀起一个向焦裕禄同志学习的热潮。
    向焦裕禄同志学习，意义十分重大。解放以来我国的农业，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，有了很大的发展，但从总的方面看，底子还比较单薄，生产水平还不够高。为迅速改变这种状况，目前我国农业战线上的广大群众和干部，根据党中央和毛主席关于发展农业靠大寨、靠党的政策、靠五亿农民积极性的指示，正在进一步发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，向大自然开战。而学习焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹和革命精神，将会使我们在这一伟大斗争中，增添新的力量，赢得新的胜利。
    学习焦裕禄同志，我们应当做到：
    一、象焦裕禄同志那样，当一个毛主席的好学生，处处以毛泽东思想挂帅，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想改造自己的立场、观点、方法，做好革命工作。焦裕禄同志是具体运用毛泽东思想，解决思想和工作中实际问题的典范。我们全体党员、干部，特别是负责干部，要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事。通过学习，在农业战线上要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，促使农业生产建设高潮持续地、健康地发展。
    二、象焦裕禄同志那样，树立一心为革命，一切为革命，全心全意为人民服务的世界观。焦裕禄同志虽然身患重病，在工作中仍然奋不顾身，那里有困难，他就到那里去，他对革命无限忠诚。我们学习焦裕禄同志，就是要学习他这种专门利人，毫不利己，为革命、为人民鞠躬尽瘁的高贵品质，进一步促进我们的思想革命化，做一个坚定的、彻底的无产阶级革命者。
    三、象焦裕禄同志那样，树雄心，立壮志，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，战胜困难，艰苦创业。兰考县是一个自然条件不好，灾害十分严重的地区，焦裕禄同志带领全县干部和群众，同自然灾害进行了顽强斗争，取得了重大胜利。他是我们农业战线上，带领群众向大自然进军、进行改天换地斗争的典范。通过学习焦裕禄同志，我们要在同大自然斗争中，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。
    四、象焦裕禄同志那样，树立理论联系实际，密切联系群众，开展批评与自我批评，认真实行集体领导的革命化的作风。焦裕禄同志坚持集体领导原则，充分发扬民主，亲自带领干部访贫问苦，善于团结同志，取得了广大干部和群众的极大信赖，对社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，作出了很大的贡献。通过学习焦裕禄同志，我们农业战线上的党员、干部要实现作风革命化，提高工作效率，每个同志都要争取做一个焦裕禄式的好干部，使我们的工作与三大革命运动的发展形势相适应。
    各级农林政治部要在各地党委的领导下，把学习焦裕禄同志的活动当做突出政治的一项重要内容来抓，要运用各种宣传工具，通过各种方式，广泛宣传焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹和革命精神，并认真组织党员、干部讨论，提高认识，改进工作，使学习焦裕禄同志的活动真正落到实处。
    农业战线的所有企业事业单位，要召开专门的会议，发动广大党员、干部，以焦裕禄同志为镜子，联系思想，联系工作，进行对照检查，找差距，订措施，为实现党员、干部的思想革命化和作风革命化，促进农业生产建设发展而奋斗。中共中央中南局
    要求在最近一段时间，把学习焦裕禄同志作为学习毛主席著作运动的一个重要组成部分。
    新华社广州十日电　中共中央中南局九日发出通知，要求全体党员和干部向焦裕禄同志学习。通知全文如下：
    河南省兰考县前县委书记焦裕禄同志，是在毛泽东思想哺育下迅速成长起来的一位坚强的无产阶级革命战士。毛泽东时代是英雄辈出的时代，焦裕禄同志就是一个这样突出的英雄的典型。作为党的一位县委书记，焦裕禄同志善于以毛泽东思想武装自己的思想和指导自己的工作，并把毛主席的指示同他的工作地区兰考县的实际情况结合起来，在革命实践中，坚决走群众路线，深入群众，向群众学习，并领导群众前进。焦裕禄同志具有不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一切为人民的无产阶级的高贵品质，又具有严肃认真的实事求是的科学态度，他把无产阶级大无畏的革命精神同扎扎实实的工作作风作了很好的结合。焦裕禄同志不愧为毛泽东同志的好学生，不愧为我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的光辉的榜样。
    目前，中南地区同全国一样，是一片大好形势。但是，我们的工作发展是不平衡的，在农村中，和在其他各条工作战线方面，还有部分的县、区和部门没有赶上来，还有少数经受严重自然灾害的地区，必须进行艰苦的斗争才能彻底改变面貌；工农业发展的潜力还很大，其他各方面也是大有可为。为了完满地实现具有伟大历史意义的第三个五年计划，为了使中南地区的工作全面地向前推进一步，我们要求全体党员和干部都要向焦裕禄同志学习，以他为榜样，要象他那样带着浓厚的阶级感情，时时事事学习毛主席著作，一言一行都以毛主席指示作为最高准则；学习他那样以实事求是的态度，以忘我的革命精神，同一切困难险阻、一切错误思想作坚决的、持久的和有效的斗争。
    中南局要求，在最近一段时间，要把学习焦裕禄同志作为学习毛主席著作运动的一个重要组成部分。全党同志，必须把人民日报二月七日发表的《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》，和人民日报社论《向毛泽东同志的好学生——焦裕禄同志学习》、《要有更多这样的好干部》以及有关文件，作为主要学习材料。
    中南局要求，县级以上的党员干部，必须采取整风学习的方法，即用理论联系实际的方法，以焦裕禄同志为镜子，严格检查自己的思想，检查本地区本单位的工作，找出同焦裕禄同志之间的差距，特别是要找出在活学活用毛主席著作方面的差距，并且要采取有效措施，缩短差距，迎头赶上。在一些正在开展政治同业务关系的大辩论的单位，应当把大辩论同兰考县的实例联系起来，学习焦裕禄同志突出政治、抓活思想，以毛泽东思想统帅一切的光辉范例，彻底批判重业务轻政治或者把政治和业务平列的折衷主义倾向。对于文化水平低的党员，要以焦裕禄同志的有关材料给他们上党课。在学习中，要求对照自己的思想，提高阶级觉悟，特别是提高学习毛主席著作的自觉性。
    我们相信，在以焦裕禄同志为榜样，在深入开展学习毛主席著作的运动中，必将迅速培养出更多的焦裕禄式的领导干部。只要我们的党员领导干部，都能象焦裕禄同志那样无限忠诚地对待党和人民的革命事业，那么我们的工作肯定会做得更出色。
    焦裕禄同志的革命实践，再一次证明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人就是最大的战斗力。兰考县本来是一个自然条件极为恶劣的地区，在焦裕禄同志的领导下，在一个不长的时间内，就在改造自然面貌方面取得了巨大的成就。我们许多地区的条件比兰考好得多，尤其应当更快地彻底改变面貌。这里根本问题在于：是不是真正用毛泽东思想武装我们的领导“班子”，是不是用毛泽东思想武装广大干部和群众。完全可以预料，只要我们把学习毛主席著作运动深入开展起来，用毛泽东思想教育全党、全体干部和广大群众，我们的事业必将大踏步前进。
    中共中央华东局
    要求全体党员和干部，尤其是县以上领导干部，都要以焦裕禄为榜样，实现思想革命化和领导革命化。
    据新华社上海十日电　中共中央华东局今天发出通知，号召华东地区全体党员和干部，尤其是县以上领导干部，都要向焦裕禄同志学习。
    通知说，焦裕禄同志是我党的好党员，是伟大的共产主义战士，是毛主席的好学生，是县委书记的好榜样，也是各行各业领导干部的好榜样。他具有无产阶级彻底的革命精神，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一切为人民。他永远保持劳动人民的本色，对群众有深厚的阶级感情，在最艰苦的环境里，与群众同甘苦，共命运。他奋不顾身地深入实际，调查研究，发动群众，依靠群众，向群众学习，同群众一起进行斗争。他始终坚持突出政治，狠抓领导机关革命化，善于当“班长”，善于团结同志，是党的民主集中制的模范执行者。
    通知要求全区全体党员和干部，尤其是县以上领导干部，都要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，改造思想，改进工作，努力实现思想革命化和领导革命化。都要象他那样，对党对人民无限忠诚，永远跟着毛主席走，永远同工人、贫下中农和其他劳动人民在一起，勇于到最艰苦的地方去挑起三大革命的重担，用“不达目的，死不瞑目”的精神，千方百计地团结群众，用毛泽东思想的伟大武器，去战胜困难，夺取胜利，真正成为全心全意为全中国人民和全世界人民服务的革命者。华东局希望，通过学习和实践，在华东各省市和各部门，在不久以后，都能出现一批焦裕禄式的好党员、好干部、好的群众领袖。
