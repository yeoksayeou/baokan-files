    Japanese Writer Nishino Praises "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"
    Chairman Mao's Speech Shines Like a Beacon
    Writers Should Devote Themselves to the People's Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo -- Japanese progressive writer Tatsukichi Nishino recently published an article in the *Akahata* (Red Flag) newspaper, saying that just as modern revisionist ideology is rampant on the international cultural front, Chairman Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" shines like a beacon, helping us to identify the direction.
    Nishino's article was written after reading the new Japanese translation of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Nishino said that in the twenty years since the first Japanese translation appeared in 1946, many readers in Japan have read this speech and been influenced by it.
    Nishino said that Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" pointed out that writers must combine with the lives and struggles of the people and devote themselves to the lives and struggles of the people. Nishino also said that Japanese readers, when reading Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," must combine it with the struggle in the Japanese cultural circles, otherwise it is impossible to correctly understand the essence of literature and art.

    日作家西野赞扬《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》
    毛主席讲话象灯塔一样光芒四射
    作家们应投身到人民的斗争中去
    新华社东京电　日本进步作家西野辰吉最近在《赤旗报》上发表文章说，正当现代修正主义思潮在国际文化战线上泛滥的时候，毛泽东主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，就象一座灯塔一样放射出光芒，帮助我们辨明方向。
    西野的这篇文章是读了《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的日文新译本后写的。西野说，从一九四六年第一个日文译本出现后到现在的二十年期间，在日本有很多读者阅读了这篇讲话，并且受到了影响。
    西野说，毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》指出了作家必须同人民的生活和斗争相结合，投身到人民的生活和斗争中去。西野还说，日本读者在阅读毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》时，必须同日本文化界的斗争结合起来，否则就不可能正确地理解文学艺术的本质。
