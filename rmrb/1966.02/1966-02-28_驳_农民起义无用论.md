　　Refuting the "Uselessness of Peasant Uprisings"
　　Li Chen
    Summary: Comrade Xu Zhaoqing's "theory of the uselessness of peasant uprisings" or "theory of the darkness of peasant uprisings" is completely consistent with Comrade Wu Han's views. He believes that peasant uprisings "can't quench the immediate thirst" and may even bring various disasters to the people. This set of "theories" serves the eternal existence of the exploiting class and the exploiting system.
    Comrade Xu Zhaoqing's "It is Necessary to See Officials Clearly with a Historical Eye" (see the "Academic Research" section of this newspaper on February 17) repeatedly attacks peasant revolutions and peasant uprisings, attempting to help Comrade Wu Han, but actually backfires. This article is not long, but it has many ingenious arguments, which can be summarized as the "theory of the uselessness of peasant uprisings," or the "theory of the darkness of peasant uprisings." In the author's mind, peasant uprisings are not only useless, but also harmful.
    When discussing the way out for peasants in the feudal era, Comrade Xu Zhaoqing said: "Peasants usually do not go to the yamen. If they want to see officials, it must be because they have important matters that need to be resolved urgently. Now, they are lightly told to launch a peasant revolution. Regardless of whether it succeeds or not, it is, after all, like trying to put out a fire with water from afar." Clearly, in his view, peasant uprisings are not as good as kowtowing to feudal bureaucrats to file a complaint. Peasant uprisings are "like trying to put out a fire with water from afar" and cannot solve the problems that peasants "urgently need to solve." In short, peasant uprisings are completely useless. This "theory of the uselessness of peasant uprisings" completely obliterates the great historical role of peasant uprisings.
    Completely obliterating it is certainly satisfying, but how do you explain the laws of historical development? Today, even a primary school student probably understands that history is the history of class struggle. Class struggle is not subjectively created by people, but is objective and inevitable. There is no question of whether or not to tell peasants to "launch a peasant revolution." Since there is the cruel exploitation and oppression of the landlord class, there will inevitably be peasant resistance, revolution, and uprising. This is an objective law that is independent of people's will. In the history of our country, there have been hundreds of peasant uprisings, both large and small. In each uprising, the peasants took up broadswords and spears to kill the feudal dynasties and the landlord class. They refused to pay taxes to the government and refused to perform corvée labor. The feudal rule suffered heavy blows. The feudal dynasties were overthrown or weakened one after another in history. How can it be said that this cannot solve the problems that peasants "urgently need to solve"? How can it be said that it is "like trying to put out a fire with water from afar"? If revolution and uprising do not solve the problem, is kowtowing and begging to "upright officials" more likely to solve the problem? Can one find a feudal dynasty in history that was overthrown because peasants complained to "honest officials"? No, the objective facts of the history of Chinese feudal society show that only "the class struggle of the peasants, peasant uprisings, and peasant wars are the real driving force of historical development." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume II, p. 619) Comrade Xu Zhaoqing wants people to "never close their eyes and engage in empty talk about theory," and to "respect objective facts," but he himself "closes his eyes" and denies peasant uprisings. Does this show even the most basic attitude of "respecting objective facts"?
    Comrade Xu Zhaoqing laments: "Throughout history, from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the end of the reign of Emperor Xuantong, although there have been hundreds or even thousands of uprisings of all sizes, in the end, it was just one dynasty replacing another." The meaning is also very clear: after all the commotion, peasant uprisings ultimately failed, and therefore are useless and should not be affirmed. It is true that due to historical limitations, peasant uprisings often failed. However, there are two diametrically opposed views on failure. One view is: "Wildfire cannot destroy them all; the spring breeze brings them back to life." The working people of our country have never tolerated or succumbed to the dark rule and cruel suppression of the landlord class. They always dared to fight again after failing, daring to launch one attack after another against reactionary rule. "Each time they used revolutionary means to achieve the overthrow and transformation of this rule" (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume II, p. 617). Peasant uprisings, peasant wars, and peasant revolutions are inextinguishable flames in history. This is the most outstanding and precious revolutionary tradition of our people. In history, the revolutionary struggle of one class overthrowing another class can never be accomplished in one fell swoop. Did the Paris Commune not also fail? Can we therefore deny the great historical significance of the Paris Commune? No. Similarly, the failure of peasant uprisings cannot be a reason to deny peasant uprisings. But Comrade Xu Zhaoqing has another view. He says contemptuously: "This is just one dynasty replacing another," thus concluding that peasant uprisings are useless. The author is probably a little guilty and hurriedly declares: "This is not to say that the peasants of the past should not have struggled." In fact, this is an admission against interest: since peasant uprisings are useless, why revolt, why engage in armed struggle? Just accept fate and be slaves forever, or wait for "upright officials" to save your lives! This is actually betraying one's ancestors and completely denying the history of the glorious struggles and bloodshed sacrifices of our ancestors. This attitude is an extremely frivolous and absurd mistake of bourgeois intellectuals.
    Comrade Xu Zhaoqing has also taken a big step forward and simply scolds peasant uprisings: "Even if the people struggle every day, revolt every month, and change dynasties every year, things will not get much better. We only need to look at the so-called chaotic Five Dynasties in history. At that time, people wandered everywhere, families were separated, and there was no talk of living and working in peace. The situation of the broad masses of the people was not better, but worse." It should be pointed out that treating the "chaotic Five Dynasties," where various feudal groups fought each other, as "peasant uprisings" is nonsense and shows a lack of historical knowledge. However, from the example of "peasant uprisings" that he holds, we can better understand the essence of this view. To put it bluntly, this is not just a "theory of the uselessness of peasant uprisings," but also a "theory of the darkness of peasant uprisings." In his view, peasant uprisings are terrible, causing great chaos and darkness in the world, causing people to "wander everywhere," "families to be separated," and no longer able to "live and work in peace." The situation "is getting worse," which is truly a great sin. Are peasant uprisings "terrible" or "very good"? What attitude should one have towards peasant uprisings? This is a question of class stand. As early as the Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan, Chairman Mao warmly praised the peasant movement as "very good." He said: "Countless millions of slaves—the peasants—are there overthrowing their man-eating enemies. The actions of the peasants are completely correct, and their actions are very good! 'Very good' is the theory of the peasants and other revolutionaries. … All revolutionary comrades must support this change, otherwise he will stand on the counter-revolutionary stand." These words are too clear, do they need further explanation? However, Comrade Xu Zhaoqing clearly does not agree with this revolutionary theory. According to his "theory," it seems that as long as the peasants obediently endure the cruel exploitation and oppression of the landlords, do not revolt, do not resist, and resolve "matters" with the help of feudal "officials," they will be able to "live and work in peace" and be "very good." Isn't this treating the so-called "peaceful and prosperous era" of the landlord class as an era of "living and working in peace" and light, while treating peasant uprisings as an era of "darkness" and "cannibalism"? What position is this really taking?
    In fact, creating various crimes for peasant uprisings is not Comrade Xu Zhaoqing's "creation." The "credit" should be given to Comrade Wu Han. Since 1958, a revolutionary wave of criticizing historical idealism with historical materialism has been launched in the historical community, calling for breaking the dynastic system centered on emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, and restoring the due position of the masses of the people in history. However, Comrade Wu Han "stuck in his throat" and insisted on fighting for the position of emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, vigorously promoting the trend of restorationism. He shouted that too much was written about peasant uprisings and too little about emperors, kings, generals, and ministers. Writing only about the "bright side of history" of peasant uprisings "lost everything." History became "pitch black, gloomy." In his view, the light of history did not come from the working people, but from emperors, kings, generals, and ministers. The era of Han Wu, Tang Zong, Kangxi, and Qianlong was an era of "light," while peasant uprisings were an era of "darkness" and "cannibalism." After Comrade Wu Han's views were exposed, Comrade Xu Zhaoqing was only picking up Wu Han's old weapons to make a feeble struggle.
    Whether it is Wu Han or Xu Zhaoqing, their views are not difficult to expose. We believe that revolution is justified and rebellion is justified. They deny peasant uprisings and try their best to beautify "upright officials," in reality, they are promoting the idea that revolution is unjustified and rebellion is unjustified, and that the landlord class's rule, exploitation, and oppression of the working people are justified. This "theory of the uselessness of peasant uprisings" or "theory of the darkness of peasant uprisings" undoubtedly serves the eternal existence of the exploiting class and the exploiting system. It can be seen that Comrade Wu Han's views did not make Comrade Xu Zhaoqing's article stand, but Comrade Xu Zhaoqing's article made Comrade Wu Han's views even more absurd. Isn't this intending to help, but backfiring?

### 驳“农民起义无用论”

　　驳“农民起义无用论”
　　黎晨
    提要　徐肇庆同志的“农民起义无用论”或“农民起义黑暗论”，是与吴晗同志的观点完全一致的。他认为农民起义“远水救不了近火”，甚至会给人民带来种种灾祸。这套“理论”是为剥削阶级和剥削制度的万古长存服务的。
    徐肇庆同志的《要用历史的眼光看清官》（见二月十七日本报“学术研究”版），一再攻击农民革命、农民起义，企图借此帮一下吴晗同志的忙，其实是帮了倒忙。这篇文章不长，却有不少妙论，概括地说，就是“农民起义无用论”，或称“农民起义黑暗论”。在作者的心目里，农民起义不但无益，而且有害。
    徐肇庆同志在谈到封建时代农民的出路时说：“农民平时是不上衙门的，要见官员，一定是有重要事情急于要解决，现在轻描淡写地叫他们发动农民革命，不论是否成功，毕竟是远水救不了近火”。很清楚，在他看来，农民起义不如向封建官僚叩头告状，农民起义是“远水救不了近火”，解决不了农民“急于要解决”的问题，一句话，农民起义是毫无用处的。这种“农民起义无用论”，一笔抹煞了农民起义的伟大历史作用。
    一笔抹煞，痛快固然痛快，可是你怎么来解释历史发展的规律呢？今天，恐怕连一个小学生也懂得：历史是阶级斗争的历史，阶级斗争不是人们主观制造的，而是客观的、必然的，根本不存在叫不叫农民“发动农民革命”的问题。既然有地主阶级的残酷剥削和压迫，就必然有农民的反抗、革命、起义，这是不依人们意志为转移的客观规律。在我国历史上，有过大小几百次农民起义，每次起义，农民都拿起大刀、长矛向封建王朝和地主阶级杀去，官府的租税不交了，劳役不服了，封建统治遭受沉重的打击，封建王朝在历史上一个又一个地被打翻了，或者被削弱了，这怎么能说不能解决农民“急于要解决”的问题，怎么能说是“远水救不了近火”呢？革命、起义不解决问题，难道向“青天大老爷”叩头哀告反而更解决问题吗？历史上找得出一个封建王朝是由于农民向“清官”告状而覆灭的吗？不，中国封建社会历史的客观事实说明，只有“农民的阶级斗争、农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。”（《毛泽东选集》第二卷，第六一九页）徐肇庆同志要人家“千万不能闭着眼睛，空谈理论”，要“尊重客观事实”，可是自己却“闭着眼睛”，否定农民起义，这有一点“尊重客观事实”的起码态度吗？
    徐肇庆同志悲叹道：“一部历史从三皇五帝一直到宣统末年，尽管大小起义事件有数百起，甚至数千起，但是搞来搞去，不过是这个王朝替代另一个王朝罢了”。意思也十分明白：闹来闹去，农民起义终归失败了，因而是没有用的，是不应当肯定的。不错，由于历史的局限，农民起义常常是失败了。但是，对于失败，人们可以有两种截然相反的看法。一种看法是：“野火烧不尽，春风吹又生”。我国劳动人民从来没有在地主阶级的黑暗统治和残酷镇压下容忍、屈服，他们总是失败了再干，敢于向反动统治实行一次又一次的冲击，“他们每次都用革命的手段达到推翻和改造这种统治的目的”（《毛泽东选集》第二卷，第六一七页）。农民起义、农民战争、农民革命是历史上扑不灭的火焰。这是我国人民最优秀、最宝贵的革命传统。在历史上，一个阶级打倒另一个阶级的革命斗争，从来不可能是一次完成的。巴黎公社不也失败了吗？难道因此就可以否定巴黎公社的伟大历史意义吗？不能。同样，农民起义的失败，也不能成为否定农民起义的理由。而徐肇庆同志却有另一种看法，他轻蔑地说：“这不过是一个王朝替代另一个王朝罢了”，从而得出农民起义无用的结论。作者大概有点心虚，赶忙声明“我这一番话并不是说，过去的农民不应该去斗争”，其实是不打自招：农民起义既然无用，又何必起义、何必搞武装斗争，还是听天由命、永世当奴隶吧，或者等待“青天大老爷”来保命吧！这实际上是数典忘祖，完全否定了我们祖先光荣斗争、流血牺牲的历史，这种态度是极其轻浮、荒诞的资产阶级知识分子的错误态度。
    徐肇庆同志还向前迈了一大步，索性骂起农民起义来了：“即使人民天天斗争，月月起义，年年换朝代，也是好不了多少的。我们只要看一看历史上的所谓乱五代，那时候人民流浪各处，妻离子散，谈不上什么安居乐业。广大人民的情况不是好一些，反而是坏一些了”。应当指出，把各封建集团混战的“乱五代”当作是“农民起义”，这是胡诌白扯，毫无历史知识。不过，从他持有的这个“农民起义”的例子，我们倒能更好地弄清这种观点的实质。说穿了，这不单是“农民起义无用论”，而且是“农民起义黑暗论”了。在他看来，农民起义糟得很，造成了天下大乱，一片黑暗，闹得人民“流浪各处”，“妻离子散”，再不能“安居乐业”，情况“是坏一些了”，真是罪莫大焉。农民起义是“糟得很”，还是“好得很”？对农民起义究竟抱什么态度？这是一个阶级立场的问题。毛主席早在《湖南农民运动考察报告》中，就曾热烈称赞农民运动“好得很”。他说：“无数万成群的奴隶——农民，在那里打翻他们的吃人的仇敌。农民的举动，完全是对的，他们的举动好得很！‘好得很’是农民及其他革命派的理论。……一切革命同志都要拥护这个变动，否则他就站到反革命立场上去了。”这几句话，说得再明白不过了，难道还需要解释吗？可是，徐肇庆同志显然不赞成这种革命理论。按照他的“理论”，似乎只要农民服服贴贴受地主的残酷剥削和压迫，不起义，不反抗，有了“事情”找封建“官员”解决解决，就能够“安居乐业”，就“好得很”。这岂不是把地主阶级的所谓“太平盛世”看作“安居乐业”的光明时代，而把农民起义看作“黑暗”时代吗？这究竟站到什么立场上去了呢？
    其实，给农民起义制造种种罪名，并不是徐肇庆同志的“创举”，论“功绩”还得归到吴晗同志的名下。一九五八年以来，历史界掀起了用历史唯物主义批判历史唯心主义的革命浪潮，要求打破以帝王将相为中心的王朝体系，恢复人民群众在历史上的应有地位。而吴晗同志却“骨鲠在喉”，硬要为帝王将相争地位，大力鼓动复古主义思潮。他大喊大叫农民起义写多了，帝王将相写少了，只写农民起义“历史上的光明面丧失了”，“一片打倒声”，历史成为“漆黑一团，灰溜溜的”。在他看来，历史之光不是来自劳动人民，而是来自帝王将相，汉武、唐宗、康熙、乾隆的时代是“光明”时代，而农民起义则是“黑暗”时代、“人吃人”的时代。吴晗同志的观点被揭发以后，徐肇庆同志不过是重新拾起吴晗的陈旧武器作一番无力的挣扎罢了。
    吴晗也好，徐肇庆也好，他们的观点是不难揭穿的。我们认为，革命有理，造反有理。而他们否定农民起义，竭力美化“清官”，实际上就是鼓吹革命无理，造反无理，地主阶级统治、剥削、压迫劳动人民是天经地义。这种“农民起义无用论”或“农民起义黑暗论”，无疑是为剥削阶级和剥削制度的万古长存服务的。可见吴晗同志的观点并没有使徐肇庆同志的文章站住脚，而徐肇庆同志的文章反而使吴晗同志的观点变得更荒谬了。这岂不是意欲帮忙，却帮了倒忙。
