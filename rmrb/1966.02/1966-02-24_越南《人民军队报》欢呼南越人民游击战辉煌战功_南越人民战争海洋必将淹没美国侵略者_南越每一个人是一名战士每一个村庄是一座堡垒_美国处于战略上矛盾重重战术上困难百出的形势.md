　　Hanoi, February 22nd (Xinhua) – The Vietnamese newspaper *People's Army Daily* published a commentary on the 22nd, pointing out that the earth-shaking power of the people's war in South Vietnam can eliminate even millions of American aggressive bandits.

　　The commentary, titled "A Desperate Chess Game for the United States," stated that the American aggressors are in an extremely passive situation, full of strategic contradictions and tactical difficulties. Although they have suffered defeats and are in trouble, they are still keen on expanding the war of aggression, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to submit. However, the more they hope, the more they will despair.

　　The commentary said that the U.S. imperialists keep babbling that the United States "will not fail" on the battlefield and that the Vietnamese people "must give up hope of military victory." On what "chess move" does the United States base this argument? The "strategists" of the Pentagon have played all sorts of tricks, mainly relying on the United States having more troops, more money, and more modern weapons and equipment, trying to "defeat" the Vietnamese people. After several meetings in Washington and Honolulu, the American aggressors are doing everything possible to increase the troop strength, firepower, mobility, and other technical tools of their expeditionary forces in South Vietnam." The commentary said, "Can increasing troops be the most effective prescription for treating the severe paralysis of the United States in South Vietnam? Absolutely not! U.S. imperialism once made a great fanfare about increasing troops. However, after more than 200,000 U.S. troops and accomplice troops poured into South Vietnam, they fell into the abyss of failure. Why is it that so many American troops with modern equipment not only can't accomplish anything, but are suffering heavy blows? Why does the American military look strong but is actually vulnerable? This is because the American bandits in South Vietnam have encountered the earth-shaking power of the people's war. In South Vietnam, the offensive, encirclement, division, and layered penetration of the people's war put the American bandits in the face of insoluble contradictions between defense and offense, concentration and dispersion, garrisoning and mobility."

　　The commentary pointed out that the Washington authorities are the most foolish, forgetting that they are dealing with a people's war. All the people of South Vietnam deeply hate the American bandits, and "every person is a soldier, every village is a fortress." In this case, even if the United States sends in millions of expeditionary troops, they will still be submerged by the vast ocean of people's war.

　　The commentary emphasized that what determines the outcome of a war and the strength of a military force is not the number of people participating in the war, but fundamentally and primarily the fighting spirit of those holding the guns. In South Vietnam, the United States is waging an unjust war of aggression, so its expeditionary forces will not have the fighting spirit.

　　Hanoi, February 23rd (Xinhua) – The Vietnamese newspaper *People's Army Daily* published an editorial on the 23rd, hailing the outstanding guerrilla warfare achievements of the South Vietnamese army and people in wiping out the U.S. and its accomplice forces in Cu Chi, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, and other places at the beginning of this year. It pointed out that this marks a new progress in the southern guerrilla warfare and more prominently proves that people's war is fully capable of thwarting any aggressive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism.

　　The editorial said that while releasing a "peace talk" smokescreen, at the beginning of this year, the American bandits and their running dogs concentrated the most powerful and elite main forces and launched five large-scale "sweeps" and many small "sweeps" in succession, attempting to "eliminate the main force of the Viet Cong." However, as in the past, these conspiracies of theirs have suffered heavy failures and have had to admit that they have not yet encountered the "main force of the Viet Cong," that is, the Southern Liberation Army. This means that its conspiracy to "eliminate the main force of the Viet Cong" is a fantasy that will never be realized.

　　The editorial said that local troops and guerrillas in various parts of the South took on the main task of countering the enemy's large-scale "sweeps" and defeating the "pacification of the countryside" conspiracy of the American bandits and their running dogs. This further proves the unparalleled power of guerrilla warfare in South Vietnam. The editorial said that it is precisely because of the power of this people's war that a guerrilla fighter can hold up a company of enemies, and the people's armed forces walking on two legs are faster and more mobile than the U.S. military equipped with modern helicopters.

　　The editorial emphasized that the people's war in Vietnam has never been so highly strengthened and developed as it is now in the South. The editorial pointed out that, clearly, the great victory of guerrilla warfare at the beginning of this year has dealt a heavy blow to the enemy's "sweep" and "pacification" conspiracies, and has put the enemy in a passive predicament of having to cope everywhere and being in a flustered mess. This once again shows that no matter how many hundreds of thousands of troops the American bandits send, and no matter how fierce "sweeps" they carry out, they will inevitably be submerged by the vast ocean of southern guerrilla warfare.

　　越南《人民军队报》欢呼南越人民游击战辉煌战功
　　南越人民战争海洋必将淹没美国侵略者
　　南越每一个人是一名战士每一个村庄是一座堡垒
　　美国处于战略上矛盾重重战术上困难百出的形势
    据新华社河内二十二日电　越南《人民军队报》二十二日发表评论指出，越南南方人民战争的惊天动地的强大威力，能消灭即使是数以百万计的美国侵略强盗。
    这篇题为《美国绝望的一盘棋》的评论说，美国侵略者正处于战略上矛盾重重、战术上困难百出的极其被动的形势中。他们虽然遭到失败和陷入困境，但仍热中于扩大侵略战争，妄图使越南人民屈服。然而，他们越是希望，就越要绝望。
    评论说，美帝国主义喋喋不休地说什么美国在战场上将“不会失败”，越南人民“必须丢掉军事胜利的希望”。美国到底根据哪“一步棋”来发出这种论调呢？五角大楼的“战略家”们曾经玩弄了所有法术，其中主要是美国仗着它军队多、钱多和有着现代化的武器装备，妄图“战胜”越南人民。经过在华盛顿、檀香山召开的几次会议，美国侵略者正在想尽一切办法来给他们在越南南方的远征军增加兵力、火力、机动力量和其它技术上的工具。”评论说，“是否增兵就可以成为医治美国在越南南方的严重瘫痪症的最有效的药方呢？完全不是！美帝国主义曾经就增兵一事大吹大擂。可是，二十多万美军和帮凶军源源开进越南南方之后，却落入失败的深渊里。为什么这样众多和有着现代化装备的美国军队不仅搞不出什么名堂，反而饱受打击呢？为什么美国兵力看起来很强实际却不堪一击呢？这是因为美国强盗在越南南方碰到了人民战争的惊天动地的强大力量。在越南南方，人民战争的进攻、包围、分割之势，层层穿插之势，使得美国强盗在防御与进攻、集中与分散、驻守与机动之间面临着难以解决的矛盾。”
    评论指出，华盛顿当局是最愚蠢的，它忘记了它正在对付的是一场人民战争。全体越南南方人民都刻骨地仇恨美国强盗，并且“每一个人就是一名战士，每一个村庄就是一座堡垒”，在这种情况下，尽管美国运进数以百万计的远征军，仍然要被人民战争的汪洋大海所淹没。
    评论强调说，决定战争的胜负和决定一支军队战斗力的强弱的，并不在于参加战争的人员的数量，而根本的和先决的在于拿枪的人的战斗精神。在越南南方，美国进行着一场非正义的侵略战争，所以它的远征军是不会具有战斗精神的。
    新华社河内二十三日电　越南《人民军队报》二十三日发表社论，欢呼越南南方军民今年年初在古芝、广义、平定、富安等地歼灭美国及其帮凶军的卓越游击战战功。它指出，这标志着南方游击战的一个新的进步，更加突出地证明了人民战争完全有可能挫败美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋。
    社论说，在施放“和谈”烟幕的同时，今年初，美国强盗及其走狗集中了最强大和最精锐的主力军，接连发动了五次大规模“扫荡”和许多小“扫荡”，妄图“消灭越共主力部队”。但是，也象过去一样，他们的这些阴谋又遭到了惨重的失败，并且不得不承认，他们尚未碰到“越共的主力”，即南方解放军。这意味着它“消灭越共主力”的阴谋是永远也实现不了的一个幻想。
    社论说，南方各地地方部队和游击队担当了这次还击敌人的大规模“扫荡”、击败美国强盗及其走狗的“绥靖农村”阴谋的主要任务。这更加证明了越南南方游击战的无比强大的威力。社论说，正是由于这种人民战争的威力，一名游击战士可以拖住一连敌人的腿，凭两条腿走路的人民武装力量比配备现代化直升飞机的美军跑得更快、更机动。
    社论强调说，越南的人民战争从来没有象目前在南方这样得到高度的加强和发展。社论指出，显然，今年年初的游击战争的巨大胜利，给了敌人的“扫荡”、“绥靖”阴谋以沉重的打击，并且使敌人陷于到处应付、手忙脚乱的被动困境。这一点，再一次说明，不管美国强盗增派几十万军队，进行何等猛烈的“扫荡”，他们也免不了要被南方游击战的汪洋大海所淹没。
