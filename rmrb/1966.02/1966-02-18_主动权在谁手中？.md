    Who Holds the Initiative?
    Associated Press reporter Wheeler recently commented on the South Vietnamese war situation, writing that "the main battles between the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces and the American aggressors are almost always conducted under conditions chosen by the communists." This sentence exposes the embarrassing situation of the American aggressors being passively beaten and reflects the increasingly unfavorable change in the balance of power on the South Vietnamese battlefield for the United States.
    Why is this happening? First, it is because American imperialism is fighting an unjust war far from its homeland, while the South Vietnamese people are fighting for independence and freedom on their own soil. Therefore, the American aggressors naturally face numerous difficulties, while the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces have the advantages of timing, location, and popular support, and can successfully choose and create conditions that are favorable to us and unfavorable to the enemy, and then give the enemy heavy blows.
    At the same time, this is because the South Vietnamese people are waging a people's war, and they can fully exert the power of a people's war. That is to say, the American aggressors have their own way of fighting, and the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces have their own way of fighting. The American aggressors attempt to use their modern weapons and superior forces to eliminate the main force of the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces. The South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces use the strategy and tactics of people's war to deal with them: when you attack me, I will make it so you cannot hit or touch me. When I attack you, I will hit you, hit you accurately, and eliminate you. Precisely because of this, the American aggressors are bound to sometimes strike empty, and sometimes be severely beaten, and be thrown into confusion.
    Because the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces adopt the strategy and tactics of "you fight your way, I fight my way; fight if we can win, retreat if we cannot," the initiative of the war is bound to be in the hands of the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces, and they can fight as they want. In this case, how could the main battles on the South Vietnamese battlefield not be "always conducted under conditions chosen by the communists"?

### 主动权在谁手中？

    主动权在谁手中？
    美联社记者惠勒最近评述南越战局写道：南越人民武装力量同美国侵略军“之间的主要战斗，几乎总是按照共产党人选择的条件进行的”。这一句话道破了美国侵略者被动挨打的狼狈处境，也反映了南越战场上双方力量对比日益不利于美国的变化。
    为什么会这样呢？首先，这是因为美帝国主义远离本土去打一场非正义的战争，南越人民则在自己的国土上为独立、自由而战。因此，美国侵略者就自然不能不是困难重重，而南越人民武装力量却有着天时、地利、人和，可以成功地选择和造成有利于我而不利于敌的条件，然后给予敌人以沉重的打击。
    同时，这是因为南越人民进行的是一场人民战争，他们能够充分发挥人民战争的威力。这就是说，美国侵略军有美国侵略军的一套打法，南越解放武装力量有南越解放武装力量的一套打法。美国侵略军企图凭借它的现代化武器和优势兵力消灭南越人民武装力量的主力。南越人民武装力量则用人民战争的战略战术来对付它：你打我时，叫你打不到，摸不着。我打你时，就要打上你，打准你，吃掉你。正是因为这样，美国侵略军就当然要时而扑空，时而挨到狠揍，被打得蒙头转向了。
    由于南越人民武装力量采取“你打你的，我打我的；打得赢就打，打不赢就走”的战略战术，战争主动权就必然掌握在南越人民武装力量的手中，他们想怎样打就怎样打。在这种情况下，南越战场上的主要战斗，怎么会不是“总是按照共产党人选择的条件进行的”呢？
