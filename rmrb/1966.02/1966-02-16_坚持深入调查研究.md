    Persist in Conducting Thorough Investigation and Research
    Su Guanghua, Deputy Manager of Nanjing Coal Construction Company

    Comrade Jiao Yulu possessed both the revolutionary courage to conquer nature and the down-to-earth style of proceeding from reality in everything. He acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings, insisted on conducting thorough investigation and research, and personally grasped first-hand information. He said, "Chewing on someone else's leftovers has no flavor." His working style, which combined revolutionary vigor and scientific spirit, is worth learning from us.

    Our Coal Construction Company is a unit responsible for supplying fuel. Under the leadership of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee, we have also done some work and achieved some success in supporting industrial production. Therefore, I thought that I had basically understood the situation of the factories, and I rarely went down to investigate anymore. The comrades below also gradually stopped doing much investigation and research. This year, we launched the campaign to increase production and practice thrift. The industrial units requested coal numbers for the first quarter that exceeded the planned supply numbers. Under these circumstances, I and other comrades visited and investigated one hundred and forty-four coal-using units separately. Only then did we discover that we were completely "groping in the dark" while sitting in the office. Some units requested more coal because they had the idea of being generous in their estimates, and we gave them more because we didn't know the real situation, resulting in coal stockpiles. Some units truthfully reported the amount of coal they needed, but because we didn't understand the situation well enough, we were afraid of oversupplying and couldn't allocate all of it to them. There were also units whose production tasks changed, and the types of coal also changed, but because we didn't understand enough, we sometimes couldn't meet their needs. After investigation and research, and by firmly grasping first-hand information, we adjusted the surplus and shortages, vigorously promoted the economical use of coal, and solved the difference without increasing the total supply, thereby supporting production. This investigation deeply educated me. Production is constantly developing, and the situation is constantly changing. To support production, we must constantly go to the production units to understand the situation. Especially as a leader, one must personally go to the front line. Only in this way can one have a say in decision-making. Any complacency is unfounded.

    I realized that: To do investigation and research like Comrade Jiao Yulu, one must first learn and apply Chairman Mao's works creatively and transform one's thinking, think of the people's interests everywhere, put the people's interests first, not for fame or profit, not afraid of hardship or death, wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people. Only in this way can one go deep into reality and do arduous work.

    坚持深入调查研究
    南京市煤建公司副经理　苏广华
    焦裕禄同志既有敢于战胜自然的革命胆略，又有一切从实际出发的扎扎实实的作风。他按照毛主席的教导办事，坚持深入调查研究，亲自掌握第一手资料，他说：“吃别人嚼过的馍没味道。”他这种革命干劲和科学精神相结合的工作作风，值得我们很好学习。
    我们煤建公司是一个负责供应燃料的单位。在中共南京市委领导下，我们也做了一些工作，对支持工业生产也取得了一些成绩。因此，我就认为对工厂的情况基本上摸得差不多了，自己就很少再下去。下面的同志，也随着不大调查研究了。今年开展了增产节约运动，工业单位提出来的第一季度要煤数字，超过了计划供应的数字。在这种情况下，我和其他同志分别到一百四十四个用煤单位调查访问，这才发现，我们原来坐在机关里完全是“瞎子摸鱼”。有的单位因为有宽打窄用的思想，多要煤炭，由于我们心中无数，就多给了，造成煤炭积压；有的单位实事求是地报了需要煤炭数，由于我们了解情况不够，深怕供应过头，没有能全部拨给他们；也有的单位，由于生产任务变化，煤种也有了变化，由于我们不够了解，有时也不能满足需要。经过调查研究，切实掌握第一手资料，进行余缺调剂，大搞节约用煤，在没有增加供应总量的情况下，解决了差额，支持了生产。这次调查深深地教育了我，生产是不断发展的，情况是不断变化的，要支持生产，就要不断地到生产单位去摸清情况。特别是作为一个领导，更要亲自上第一线，只有这样，才能在决策的时候有发言权。任何自满情绪都是没有根据的。
    我体会到：要象焦裕禄同志那样作调查研究，首先就要象焦裕禄同志那样认真活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想，处处想到人民的利益，把人民的利益放在第一位，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民。只有这样，才能深入实际做艰苦的工作。
