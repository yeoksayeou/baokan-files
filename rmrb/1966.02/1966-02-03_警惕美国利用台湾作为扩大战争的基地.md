    Beware of the United States Using Taiwan as a Base to Expand the War
    People's Daily Commentator

    While the Johnson administration is stepping up its expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, it has openly dispatched C-130 "Hercules" aircraft to be stationed in Taiwan. According to United Press International, the U.S. Air Force intends to use the Kungkuan base in Taiwan to "support the Vietnam War." This is an important measure by U.S. imperialism to turn Taiwan into a base for expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, and a serious step in driving the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to act as an accomplice of the United States in its aggression against Vietnam.

    Chiang gang newspapers and Western news agencies have long revealed that Taiwan's bases will "play a major role" in the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. The Johnson administration not only dispatched C-130 "Hercules" aircraft, but also plans to send its B-52 strategic bombers stationed in Guam to Taiwan in order to "shorten" the "round trip" for bombing Vietnam. Not long ago, Washington's military and political figures, Humphrey, Wheeler, Harris and others, went to Taiwan one after another to hold talks with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to discuss the situation in Vietnam and the "strengthening of cooperation between the United States and Chiang." From this, it can be seen that the entry of U.S. C-130 "Hercules" aircraft into the Kungkuan base in Taiwan is the specific implementation of a series of new collusions between the United States and Chiang to expand the Vietnam War.

    It is worth noting that recently, under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has also been actively engaged. It has already sent a so-called "military advisory group" to South Vietnam, and handed over four landing craft to the South Vietnamese puppet regime. At the same time, the Chiang gang has also intensified its harassment activities against our country's southeast coastal areas from the sea and air. These signs indicate that the Johnson administration is increasingly openly using the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to serve its military adventures in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    U.S. imperialism has long occupied our country's territory of Taiwan, and now it wants to further use it as a base for aggression against Vietnam and the expansion of the war. This is a blatant provocation not only against the Vietnamese people but also against the Chinese people, and cannot but arouse the great indignation of the Chinese people!

    Taiwan is Chinese territory. The Chinese people will settle this account with U.S. imperialism for its occupation of Taiwan, and the Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan. The Johnson administration has been beaten to the point of desperation in Vietnam, and now it vainly attempts to use Taiwan to expand the war and drive the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to act as an accomplice in its aggression against Vietnam. U.S. imperialism's doing so will absolutely not save it from its doomed failure, but will only lead to even more disastrous failures. If the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang willingly acts as an accomplice of the United States in its aggression against Vietnam and intensifies its harassment of our country's southeast coastal areas, it will surely be subjected to even more severe punishment.

    警惕美国利用台湾作为扩大战争的基地
    本报评论员
    约翰逊政府在加紧扩大侵越战争的同时，竟公然派遣C—130“大力士”式飞机进驻台湾。据合众国际社报道，美国空军要利用台湾的公馆基地，来“支持越南战争”。这是美帝国主义把台湾作为扩大侵越战争基地的一个重要措施，是它驱使蒋介石匪帮充当美国侵越帮凶的一个严重步骤。
    蒋帮报纸和西方通讯社早就透露，台湾的基地将在美国侵略越南战争中“起主要作用”。约翰逊政府不仅派遣C—130“大力士”式飞机，而且还要把它驻扎在关岛的B—52型战略轰炸机派到台湾，以“缩短”轰炸越南的“往返航程”。不久以前，华盛顿的军政头目汉弗莱、惠勒、哈里斯等人先后跑到台湾，同蒋介石匪帮进行会谈，讨论越南局势和美蒋“加强合作问题”。由此可见，美国C—130“大力士”式飞机进驻台湾公馆基地，是美蒋之间为扩大越南战争而进行的一系列新勾结的具体实施。
    值得注意的是，最近一个时期，蒋介石匪帮在美帝国主义的指使下，也积极活动起来。它已经派一个所谓“军事顾问团”前往南越，把四艘登陆艇交给南越傀儡集团使用。与此同时，蒋帮从海上和空中对我国的东南沿海地区也加紧骚扰活动。这些迹象表明，约翰逊政府正日益公开地利用蒋介石匪帮为它扩大印度支那和东南亚的军事冒险服务。
    美帝国主义长期霸占我国领土台湾，现在又要进一步把它作为侵略越南和扩大战争的基地，这不仅是对越南人民而且也是对中国人民明目张胆的挑衅，不能不引起我国人民的极大愤慨！
    台湾是中国的领土，美帝国主义侵占台湾的这笔账总是要算的，中国人民是一定要解放台湾的。约翰逊政府在越南已被打得走投无路，现在妄想利用台湾扩大战争，驱使蒋介石匪帮充当侵略越南的走卒。美帝国主义这样做是绝对挽救不了它失败的命运的，而且只能招致更加惨重的失败。蒋介石匪帮如果甘当美国侵略越南的走卒，加紧骚扰我国东南沿海地区，一定要遭到更加严厉的惩罚。
