　　Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 21st dispatch: Following the long anti-China statement issued by Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro on February 6th, Cuba has activated its entire propaganda machine, unleashing a foul anti-China hysteria.
    Cuban newspapers universally published Castro's anti-China statement with sensational headlines. The Cuban Communist Party's official newspaper, *Granma*, used an entire page on the front page, with five different types of fonts, to publish a total of twenty lines of large-character headlines attacking China. The main headline was: "Fidel's Response to the Chinese Government's Statement: The Chinese Government Has Betrayed the Trust of the Cuban People and Actually Participated in the US Imperialist Blockade Against Cuba. Two Things Should Be Made Clear: The Chinese Statement Contains Enormous Hypocrisy and Reveals Contempt for the Feelings of Other Peoples." The sentence "The Chinese Government Has Betrayed the Trust of the Cuban People" occupied one-quarter of the page, and the font used was even larger than the font of the *Granma* masthead.
    At the same time, Havana Radio repeatedly broadcast Castro's anti-China statement day and night, slandering China thousands of times. Subsequently, in the following days, it continuously broadcast various news attacking China.
    *Granma* published on the 7th, 8th, and 9th consecutive days statements, resolutions, and letters purportedly from Cuban government agencies, people's organizations, schools, etc., supporting Castro's anti-China stance, news of "combat meetings" held by some institutions, as well as anti-China cartoons and photographs. In an editor's note published by the newspaper on the 9th, it announced that it had "received thousands of telegrams supporting the position taken by the Cuban leadership on this issue." On the 11th, under the headline "Support for Fidel's Reply to the Chinese Government," which occupied eight columns, the newspaper published a list of approximately three hundred national organizations at all levels and photos of some letters.
    The Cuban Communist Party's official newspaper also used the headline "Fidel's Statement Has Caused a Wide Reaction Around the World" to report on the commentaries from newspapers in imperialist countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as newspapers in Poland and Czechoslovakia, applauding Castro's anti-China statement. The US imperialist newspapers cited included: *The New York Times*, *New York Herald Tribune*, *New York American Journal*, *New York World Telegram* and *New York Post*, etc. It quoted the *New York Herald Tribune* as saying: "This is not simply a matter of an economic nature, but rather due to China's insistence on distributing propaganda in the Cuban armed forces."

　　卡斯特罗二月六日发表反华声明以后
　　古巴宣传机器掀起反华歇斯底里
　　报纸大肆煽动，电台日夜广播，千百次重复卡斯特罗对中国的诽谤
    新华社二十一日讯　哈瓦那消息：在古巴总理菲德尔·卡斯特罗二月六日发表长篇反华声明以后，古巴开动了它的全部宣传机器，在古巴掀起了一阵乌烟瘴气的反华歇斯底里。
    古巴报刊普遍用煽动性的标题刊登了卡斯特罗的反华声明。古巴共产党机关报《格拉玛报》在第一版以整版的篇幅，用五种不同类型的字体，刊登了共二十行攻击中国的大字标题。主标题是：《菲德尔对中国政府声明的回答，中国政府背叛了古巴人民的信任，实际上参予了美帝国主义对古巴的封锁，应当说明两件事：中国声明包含着巨大的伪善，并暴露出蔑视其他人民的感情。》其中“中国政府背叛了古巴人民的信任”这一句占四分之一的版面，所用的字体，比《格拉玛报》报头的字体还要大。
    与此同时，哈瓦那电台日夜反复广播卡斯特罗的反华声明，千百次地诽谤中国。接着，在以后的几天里，又连续播送各种攻击中国的消息。
    《格拉玛报》在七日、八日、九日连续刊登据称来自古巴政府机关、人民团体、学校等支持卡斯特罗反华的声明、决议和信件，一些机构举行“战斗会议”的消息以及反华的漫画和照片。这家报纸在九日发表的一篇编辑部按语中宣布，它“收到数以千计的电报，这些电报支持古巴领导人在这个问题上所采取的立场”。这家报纸在十一日又在《支持菲德尔对中国政府的答复》这一占八栏地位的标题下，刊登了约三百个全国各级组织的名单和一些信件的照片。
    这家古巴共产党机关报还用《菲德尔的声明引起全世界的广泛反应》这一标题，报道了美国、英国等帝国主义国家报纸以及波兰、捷克斯洛伐克的报纸为卡斯特罗反华声明叫好的评论。其中被引用的美帝国主义的报纸包括：《纽约时报》、《纽约先驱论坛报》、《纽约美国人日报》、《纽约世界电讯报》和《纽约邮报》等。它引用《纽约先驱论坛报》的话说：“这不单纯是经济性质的问题，而是由于中国坚持在古巴武装部队中散发宣传品。”
