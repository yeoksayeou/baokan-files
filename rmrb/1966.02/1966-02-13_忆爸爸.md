　　My father, Jiao Yulu, passed away more than a year ago. Whenever I recall his kind face, his education of me, his wholehearted dedication to the interests of the people, and his hardworking and simple style, I cannot help but shed tears. I am determined to transform grief into strength and earnestly carry on the cause that my father did not complete.

　　My father was never afraid of hardship in his work. In the summer of 1963, one day late at night, the wind howled, and the rain poured down like a deluge. My mother and I woke up, but we didn't know where my father had gone. We were both very anxious at the time and couldn't find him anywhere. In the end, the county committee's communications officer found him near the railway station. Later, when asked why he went out without telling the family, he said, "The rain is so heavy, I'm very worried. Some of the commune members' houses in Chengguan Town are not very sturdy, so I went to take a look." I remember another time, the north wind was very strong, and the ground was covered with deep snow. My father led several comrades from the county committee out into the wind and snow and didn't return until late at night. I asked him what he was doing out in such a storm. He said, "The more this kind of weather, the more necessary it is to go to the masses' homes and see." My father often lived in the countryside. Even when he returned to the county committee to attend meetings and study work, he would take time in the evenings to visit the homes of the masses near Chengguan. Because he often didn't pay attention to rest, his health deteriorated day by day. The family was very worried about him. My mother often suggested that he pay attention to rest and actively seek medical treatment, but he didn't take it seriously. Several times, my mother was so worried that she cried.

　　My father knew the seriousness of his illness. Every night when he went to sleep, he had to use something to prop up the painful area of his liver so that he could slowly fall asleep. Even so, he still insisted on working day and night. When he finally gave the "Report on Learning from Daqing's Experience," he was already very ill, but he still used a long-handled brush to prop up his severely painful liver and stayed up several nights to finally write the draft of the report. He didn't stop working until his condition worsened to the point where he couldn't eat anything and couldn't move.

　　My father was very frugal in his life. In 1952, when he returned to his hometown, Beigushan Village in Zibo, Shandong Province, to pick me up, he was wearing worn-out clothes. At the time, the villagers said that he had been a cadre outside for several years and should be very well-off, but he hadn't even managed to get a decent set of clothes. When he heard this, he smiled nonchalantly and said, "When everyone is wearing good clothes, I will naturally be wearing good clothes too." My father often couldn't bear to make new clothes for himself. Whether it was a single layer of clothing or a cotton-padded coat, it was always patch upon patch. Sometimes my mother would advise him to alter the old clothes for the children to wear, but he refused, saying, "Adults can wear them. It would be a pity to alter them for the children!" In 1962, when my father worked at the Weishi County Committee, he only had one set of old cotton-padded clothes. My mother, feeling sorry for him working in the countryside and getting cold, insisted on making him a new set of cotton-padded clothes. Later, a comrade from the organization also wanted to help my father find a way to make a new set of cotton-padded clothes, but he firmly refused. In 1963, when my father worked in Lankao County, because our family's quilts were all tattered, we always flipped them over at night. After other comrades learned about this situation, they advised him to buy some disaster relief cloth and cotton to sew a quilt. At this time, he patiently said, "Disaster relief items are for the disaster-stricken masses. How can we buy them? Our quilts are tattered, and we need to make a new one, but we should see that the masses in the disaster areas need them even more than we do!"

　　My father never liked any special treatment for himself and severely criticized others for giving him things. In 1962, during the New Year, the comrades of the county committee sent a few pounds of meat to our house. At that time, my father asked, "Does everyone have a share?" The comrade said it was for the secretary's care, so he politely declined, "My family has already bought meat, please give it to the comrades who haven't bought meat!" It was in the winter of this year that a cadre from a commune sent us a lot of peanuts. When I came home from school, I saw a pile of peanuts on the table and was very happy. I asked my grandmother, "Where did the peanuts come from?" My grandmother pointed to the cadre who sent the peanuts and said, "The uncle who was talking to your father sent them." When I went over to listen, my father was seriously criticizing the cadre, and as a result, he had to take the peanuts back. We sisters and brothers were very envious, but we didn't get to eat a single peanut. In the early summer of 1963, one time when my father was not at home, a cadre from the Chengguan Commune in Lankao County sent us a few fish. My younger brothers and sisters were overjoyed when they saw the fish, and a group of children gathered together playing and laughing. When my father came back and saw his younger brothers and sisters playing happily, he was also very happy. However, after he asked clearly where the fish came from, he hurriedly asked someone to send them back.

　　My father nominally ate in the county committee's cafeteria, but in reality, he mostly ate with us at home. Because we had a large family, plus my father managed things tightly, the nine of us spent, on average, at most a few jiao on vegetables each day. Because his health was not good, sometimes my mother would make him some better food, but he would always say, "Just get some greens to eat, don't waste anything like this again." One time, my younger brother asked to eat some better food at home more often. My father said, "If you develop bad habits of being lazy and gluttonous from a young age, you will likely become someone who only knows how to enjoy life and doesn't know how to work when you grow up. In our family, we should dig out the roots of revisionism."

　　My father was very strict with us sisters and often told my mother, "Don't give the children pocket money casually, so as not to develop bad habits of not knowing how to save." He also often told the family not to accept free tickets for plays and movies casually. One time, my younger brother came home and said that he had seen a play outside. My father asked him where the money came from. He said that the uncle at the theater gave him the ticket. My father severely criticized my younger brother and took out two jiao for him to send to the ticket seller. When I was in school, my father gave me almost no pocket money other than my food expenses each month. At that time, I complained to him, saying, "Why do you only make me wear old clothes and don't give me any pocket money? I, the secretary's daughter, can't compare to anyone." After my father heard this, he educated me, saying, "The secretary's daughter cannot be superior to others. At school, you must respect teachers and unite with classmates. On the street, you must be polite to the masses. You can only take the lead in being hardworking and cannot have any special privileges. Besides, what you are wearing now is not bad. You have cotton in winter and single layers in summer. Although it's a bit tattered, it doesn't expose any flesh. It's much better than what I wore when I was a child!"

　　In 1963, I didn't get into high school after graduating from junior high school. Thinking it was very embarrassing, I hid at home all day and didn't want to go out. My father wanted me to go to the Heshangzhuang Farm in Weishi County to work. No matter how much he urged me, I always refused to go. Later, he asked me to learn to be a barber and become a barber worker. I felt even more embarrassed and wouldn't go no matter what. At this time, others said that they would introduce me to be a primary school teacher in the countryside, or to be a telephone operator at the post office, or to be a salesperson in a store... Although I agreed to these, my father wouldn't let me go. He said that I had the bourgeois ideology of disliking labor and that I must find a job with relatively heavy physical labor to train me. At that time, I simply didn't think he was concerned about me and was really dissatisfied in my heart. Since then, he often educated me at night, talking about the past and comparing it to the present. He said, "Our family has been exploited by others for generations and didn't have a single scholar. Your grandfather was forced to hang himself because the landlord urged him to repay his debts. After your grandfather died, I led the whole family out to flee the famine. At that time, the whole family ate boiled wild vegetables with clear water, and there was no cotton clothing in winter. One of your older brothers also died of hunger and illness on the road to flee the famine. Now you have graduated from middle school and become our family's 'scholar.' If you don't listen to the Party's words and participate in labor, who can you be worthy of?" Under my father's patient education, I finally understood. When I went to work as a temporary worker in the Lankao County Food Processing Factory, my father found Director Zhang Shusen and instructed him, "My daughter is working here as a temporary worker. When assigning work, you must arrange for her to go to the pickles group. This will be good for reforming her thoughts of being afraid of dirt and fatigue." Finally, he said, "Don't think that this is my daughter and treat her differently. You should be stricter with her."

　　On May 4, 1964, when I went to the hospital in Zhengzhou to visit my father, his lips were cracked, his face was as yellow as paper, and he spoke with great effort, still panting. The first thing he asked me when he saw me was, "Xiaomei, has our Lankao County been flooded? Tell me the actual situation of our county!" I said, "Dad, take good care of yourself. Our place hasn't been flooded." My father said disbelievingly, "I know. I want to get well soon and go back to work immediately." In his weak words to me, he also taught me, "Xiaomei, listen to your mother, help your mother take good care of your younger brothers and sisters. You have joined the revolutionary work. Dad has nothing to give you. Let the set of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' at home be my gift to you! Mao Zedong will tell you how to work, how to be a person, and how to live..."

　　On May 14, 1964, my father passed away. How sad I was! For more than a year, my father's tireless revolutionary spirit has been inspiring me.

　　In recent days, the newspaper has published my father's revolutionary deeds again, and Party organizations at all levels have issued a call to learn from my father's spirit of thorough revolution. My mood is even more excited, and tears are streaming down my face. I have read the report on my father's revolutionary deeds in the newspaper more than a dozen times. Every time I pick up the newspaper, I seem to hear my father's voice: "Xiaomei, let the set of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' at home be my gift to you! Mao Zedong will tell you how to work, how to be a person, and how to live..." I will never forget these words in my life. I am now working as a typist at the Kaifeng Prefectural Finance and Trade Political Cadre School in Henan Province. I want to be like my father, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works flexibly, doing revolution for the rest of my life, studying Chairman Mao's works for the rest of my life, constantly using Mao Zedong Thought to transform my own thoughts, establish a proletarian worldview, and be a "completely" and "thorough" "old ox" of the people for the rest of my life; I want to be like my father, tenaciously facing the difficulties on the road forward, enduring great hardships and hard work, and dedicating everything I have to the revolution; I want to be like my father, always maintaining the fine style of hard work and simplicity, always maintaining the true qualities of the working people; I want to be like my father, struggling hard for the revolutionary cause all my life, always listening to the Party's words, doing whatever the Party tells me to do, and going wherever it is difficult. I will thoroughly follow my father's legacy, achieve looking upward in thought, looking downward in life, looking forward with my eyes, relying on the Party everywhere, taking the lead in everything, standing firm in the storms of class struggle, working hard in the upsurge of socialist construction, undergoing tests in the struggle, and training myself to become a red successor of the proletariat.

    忆爸爸
    焦守凤
    我的爸爸焦裕禄病故一年多了。每当我回忆起他那慈祥的面孔，回忆起他对我的教育，回忆起他那一心一意为人民利益而工作和他那艰苦朴素的作风时，总不免使我止不住地流下泪来。我决心化悲痛为力量，认真去做爸爸没有完成的事业。
    爸爸在工作上从来是不怕吃苦的。一九六三年夏季，有一天深夜，狂风刮得呼呼叫，大雨下得象瓢泼，我和妈妈醒来以后，却不知道爸爸到哪儿去了。当时我和妈妈都很着急，到处都找不到他。最后还是县委的通讯员在火车站附近找到了他。后来问他为什么出外不给家里人说一声，他说：“雨下得这么紧，我心里很着急，城关镇有些社员的住房不很牢固，我去转了一圈看看。”记得还有一次，北风刮得很急，地上积雪很深，爸爸领着县委的几个同志顶风出门去了，深夜以后才冒雪回来。我问他这么大的风雪，出去干什么，他说：“越是这种天气，越是需要到群众家里看看。”我爸爸经常住在乡下，即使回到县委开会，研究工作，也要抽出晚上时间，到城关附近群众家里访问。由于他经常不注意休息，身体便一天天坏了起来。家里的人对他很耽心，妈妈经常提意见要他注意休息，积极治病，他却不当成一回事，有几次都把妈妈急得哭起来。
    爸爸的病情的严重性他自己是知道的，每天晚上睡觉时，必须用东西把肝部疼痛的地方顶着，才能慢慢地睡着。就这样他仍然没明没黑地坚持工作。到最后作“学习大庆的经验报告”时，他已经病得很厉害了，还仍然用一把长把毛刷子顶着剧痛的肝，熬了几个夜晚，终于写完了报告草稿。一直到他病情恶化得汤水不进，不能动弹时，才停止了工作。
    爸爸在生活上非常艰苦。一九五二年他回老家山东省淄博北崮山村接我时，穿着一身破旧衣服，当时村上的人说他在外边当了几年干部，应该很阔气，结果却连一身衣服也没有混上。他听说以后，毫不在意地笑了笑说：“等到大家穿得都好了，我自然也就穿得好了。”爸爸经常舍不得做一件新衣服穿，无论单衣棉衣，总是大补钉压小补钉，有时妈妈劝他把破旧的衣服改一改给孩子穿，他却不肯，说：“大人能穿，改给孩子们穿太可惜啦！”一九六二年爸爸在尉氏县委工作时，他只有一套旧棉衣，妈妈怜他经常下乡工作受冷，坚持要给他做一身新棉衣。后来机关有位同志也要帮我爸爸设法做套新棉衣，可是他坚决不要。一九六三年爸爸在兰考县工作时，由于我们家里被子都烂了，晚上总是翻盖着，别的同志了解这种情况后，劝他买一点救灾布和棉花缝条被子，这时他却耐心地说：“救灾的东西是给受灾群众的，我们怎么能买？我们盖的被子烂了，是需要做条新的，但是，应该看到，灾区的群众比我们更需要！”
    爸爸向来不喜欢对他有什么照顾，并且严厉批评别人给他送东西。一九六二年过年时，县委的同志往俺家送了几斤肉，当时爸爸就问：“人人都有一份吗？”那个同志说是对书记照顾的，他就婉言谢绝了：“我家已经买好肉啦，请送给没有买好肉的同志吃吧！”正是这一年的冬天，一个公社的干部给俺送去许多花生。我放学回家后，看见桌子上放着一堆花生，非常高兴，就问外祖母：“花生是哪里弄来的？”外祖母指着那个送花生的干部说：“是跟你爸爸谈话的那个叔叔送的。”我过去一听，爸爸正在严肃地批评那个干部，结果又让他把花生带走了。我们姊妹几个尽管眼馋，到底也没有吃到一个花生。一九六三年初夏，有一次爸爸不在家，兰考县城关公社一个干部给我们送了几条鱼。弟弟妹妹们看见鱼高兴得不得了，一群孩子围在一起玩着笑着。爸爸回来后见弟弟妹妹正在高兴地玩耍，也很高兴。可是，当他问清楚鱼的来历以后，就急忙叫人送回去了。
    爸爸名义上是在县委食堂吃饭，实际上多半是在家里跟我们在一起吃的。由于我们人口多，加上爸爸管得紧，九口人平均每天最多吃几角钱的菜。因为他的身体不好，有时妈妈给他另外做点好吃的饭菜，他总是说：“搞点青菜吃就行啦，千万不要再这样浪费。”有一次弟弟要求家里经常吃些好的，爸爸说：“从小就养成又懒又馋的坏习惯，长大了很可能变成只会享福不会劳动的人，在咱家里应当挖掉修正主义根子。”
    爸爸对我们姐妹要求很严，经常给妈妈讲：“不要随便给孩子们零花钱，免得养成不知节约的坏习惯。”他还经常告诉家里，不准随便接受不要钱的戏票和电影票。有一次弟弟回家后说他在外边看戏，爸爸问他哪里来的钱，他说是戏院叔叔给的票。爸爸狠狠地批评了弟弟一顿，并拿出两角钱要他给售票员送去。我在上学期间，爸爸每月除了供给我伙食费以外，几乎没有一点零花钱，那时我向他提意见说：“你为什么光叫我穿烂衣服，也不给个零花钱，我这书记的女儿跟谁都比不上。”爸爸听了以后，教育我说：“书记的女儿不能高人一等，在学校要尊敬老师，团结同学，在街上对群众要有礼貌，只能带头艰苦，不能有任何特殊。再说你现在穿的并不坏，冬有棉、夏有单，虽然破一点，也没有露出肉来，比我小时候穿得好多啦！”
    一九六三年我初中毕业没有考上高中，想着很丢人，终日躲在家里不想出门。爸爸要我到尉氏县和尚庄农场去劳动。不管他怎样催我，我始终不去。后来叫我去学理发，当个理发工人，我更嫌丢人，无论如何也不去。就在这时别人说，介绍我到农村当小学教员，又说到邮电局当话务员，又说到商店当营业员……这些我虽然同意，爸爸却不让我去，他说我有厌恶劳动的资产阶级思想，一定得找一个体力劳动比较重的职业来锻炼我，那时我简直不以为他是对我关心，心中实在不满意。自那以后，他经常在晚上对我进行教育，说说过去，比比现在，他说：“咱家祖祖辈辈受人剥削，没有一个读书人，你爷爷因地主催着还债，逼得上吊了。爷爷死后，我领着全家出外逃荒，那时全家吃的是清水煮野菜，冬天无棉衣，你一个哥哥也在逃荒的路上，冻饿病死。现在你中学毕了业，成了咱家的‘秀才’，要不好好听党的话，参加劳动，你能对得起谁？”在爸爸的耐心教育下，我终于想通了。在我到兰考县食品加工厂当临时工时，爸爸找着张树森厂长交代：“我的女儿在这里做临时工，分配工作时一定要把她安排到酱菜组，这样对改造她怕脏怕累的思想有好处。”最后他又说：“你们不要以为这是我的女儿，就另眼看待，应该对她要求得严些。”
    一九六四年五月四日，我到郑州的医院去看望爸爸时，他嘴唇干裂，脸黄如纸，说话用了很大力气，仍然上气不接下气。他见我第一句话就问：“小梅，咱兰考县淹了没有？你把咱县的实际情况告诉我！”我说：“爸爸，你好好养病吧，咱们那里没有淹。”爸爸不相信地说：“我知道。我要赶快把病治好，马上回去工作。”在他对我少气无力的谈话中还教导我说：“小梅，要听妈妈的话，帮助妈妈带好弟弟妹妹，你参加革命工作了，爸爸没有什么送你，家里的那套《毛泽东选集》，就作为送你的礼物吧！那里边毛主席会告诉你怎么工作，怎么做人，怎么生活……”
    一九六四年五月十四日，爸爸与世长辞了，我是多么悲痛！一年多来，爸爸那种不知疲倦的革命精神，一直在鼓舞着我。
    这几日来，报纸上又刊登了爸爸的革命事迹，各级党组织发出了学习爸爸彻底革命精神的号召，我的心情更加激动，泪水直往外涌。报上刊载爸爸革命事迹的报道，我一连读了十几遍。我每当拿到报纸的时候，耳边就仿佛听到了爸爸的声音：“小梅，家里那套《毛泽东选集》，就作为送给你的礼物吧！那里边毛主席会告诉你怎么工作，怎么做人，怎么生活……”这几句话我一辈子也忘不了。我现在在河南省开封专署财贸政治干校做打字工作。我要象爸爸那样，活学活用毛主席著作，干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席著作，不断用毛泽东思想改造自己的思想，树立无产阶级的世界观，“完全”“彻底”地当一辈子人民的“老黄牛”；我要象爸爸那样顽强地对待前进道路上的困难，吃大苦、耐大劳，为革命献出自己的一切；我要象爸爸那样永远保持艰苦朴素的优良作风，永远保持劳动人民的本色；我要象爸爸那样为革命事业艰苦奋斗一生，永远听党的话，党叫我干啥我就干啥，那里艰苦我就到那里去。彻底遵循爸爸的遗教，做到思想向上看，生活向下看，眼睛向前看，处处依靠党，事事带头干，在阶级斗争的风浪里，站稳立场，在社会主义建设的高潮中，努力工作，在斗争中经受考验，把自己锻炼成一个无产阶级的红色接班人。
