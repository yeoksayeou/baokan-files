    People's Revolutionary War Creates Miracles, Annihilating American Air Pirates Without an Air Force
    South Vietnamese Military and Civilians Damage Over 800 American Aircraft in Surprise Attacks on Airfields Over the Past Two Years
    Vietnamese Newspapers Hail the South Vietnamese Military and Civilians' Glorious Victory in Eliminating the American's Enormous Air Force
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 11th (Telegraph) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation Radio, the heroic South Vietnamese military and civilians, from their first attack on Soc Trang airfield in September 1963 to their surprise attack on Phu Loi airfield in Thu Dau Mot Province on the night of January 30th this year, have launched 35 attacks on American aggressors' military airfields in South Vietnam in less than two years and five months. According to incomplete statistics, they have destroyed and damaged approximately 820 American aircraft of various types, eliminated over 4,000 enemy personnel, including about 3,200 American aggressor troops. Simultaneously, they have burned tens of millions of liters of gasoline, destroyed hundreds of military vehicles and many "Hawk" missile launchers, and burned many American barracks and military supply warehouses.

    In 1965, American bandit aircraft began continuously bombing North Vietnam. The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, with the determination to avenge the people of North Vietnam, constantly struck directly at important air force bases heavily defended by American troops, causing the American aggressors to suffer increasingly heavy losses. In that year, they launched 22 attacks on American military airfields, destroying and damaging 634 enemy aircraft, killing and wounding over 2,500 American aggressor troops, powerfully coordinating with the fight of the North Vietnamese military and civilians against the American air pirates.

    In these two years, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces repeatedly attacked the American aggressors' airfields. Among them, Soc Trang, Tan Son Nhut (Saigon), Thanh Qui (My Tho Province), Bien Hoa, Da Nang, Nha Trang (Khanh Hoa Province), An Tan (Quang Nam Province) and other airfields were attacked two to seven times. Soc Trang airfield was attacked as many as seven times, with 175 aircraft destroyed and damaged. Bien Hoa airfield, which was attacked three times, lost a total of 276 aircraft, and nearly a thousand American aggressor troops were killed or wounded.

    The tactics of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces in attacking enemy airfields are also infinitely varied, sometimes shelling, sometimes surprise attacks, sometimes planting landmines for explosions; sometimes, after shelling, commando teams suddenly and unpredictably insert themselves into the airfield to carry out explosions, and then safely retreat. These ingenious tactics make it impossible for the enemy to defend against them, repeatedly suffering blows without any way to counter them. In 1965, the Liberation Armed Forces sometimes attacked two or three enemy airfields simultaneously, making it impossible for the enemy to attend to both ends, resulting in even heavier losses. For example, on October 27th last year, the Liberation Armed Forces simultaneously attacked the Norman airfield in Da Nang and the Chu Lai airfield in Quang Nam Province, destroying 157 enemy aircraft in one fell swoop and eliminating more than 580 American troops. The Liberation Armed Forces sometimes closely coordinated and continuously attacked, giving the terrified American aggressors no chance to breathe. For example, on July 1st and 2nd last year, they launched five surprise attacks on Da Nang, Soc Trang, Pleiku, Tuy Hoa (Phu Yen Province) and other airfields.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 12th (Telegraph) - The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 11th, emphasizing that the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces, without an air force, are also able to eliminate the enormous air force of the United States. The glorious victory of the South Vietnamese military and civilians in attacking enemy airfields for more than two years has dealt a heavy blow to the so-called "absolute air superiority" boasted by the American aggressors.

    The editorial said that without an air force, it is still possible to eliminate the enemy's enormous air force; this is a miracle of the people's revolutionary war.

    The Vietnamese "People's Army Daily" also published a commentary on the 11th, pointing out that the glorious achievements of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces in successfully attacking a series of American military airfields in a short period of time once again demonstrate the great power of people's war, and demonstrate that the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces are capable of defeating any enemy with the most modern equipment.

### 人民革命战争创造奇迹，没有空军也能痛歼美国空中强盗  南越军民两年多来奇袭机场毁伤美机八百多架  越南报纸欢呼南方军民消灭美国庞大空军力量的辉煌胜利

    人民革命战争创造奇迹，没有空军也能痛歼美国空中强盗
    南越军民两年多来奇袭机场毁伤美机八百多架
    越南报纸欢呼南方军民消灭美国庞大空军力量的辉煌胜利
    新华社河内十一日电　据越南南方解放电台报道，英雄的越南南方军民从一九六三年九月第一次袭击朔庄机场到今年一月三十日夜袭土龙木省的富利机场，在不到两年五个月的时间里，已先后对美国侵略者在南越的军用机场发动了三十五次袭击；据不完全统计，共击毁击伤美国各种类型飞机约八百二十架，歼敌四千多名，其中美国侵略军约三千二百名。与此同时还烧毁汽油数千万公升，摧毁军车成百辆和“隼式”导弹发射台多座，烧毁许多美军营房和军用物资仓库。
    一九六五年，美国强盗飞机开始连续地轰炸越南北方。越南南方解放武装力量怀着为北方人民报仇雪恨的决心，不断直捣有美军重兵防守的重要空军基地，使美国侵略者遭到越来越惨重的损失。在这一年中，他们先后袭击美军机场达二十二次，击毁击伤敌机六百三十四架，打死打伤美国侵略军二千五百多人，有力地配合了越南北方军民反击美国空中强盗的战斗。
    在这两年多内，越南南方解放武装力量多次反复袭击美国侵略军的机场，其中朔庄、新山一（西贡）、申九义（美萩省）、边和、岘港、芽庄（庆和省）、安新（广南省）等机场都被袭击了二次到七次。朔庄机场被袭击达七次之多，毁伤飞机达一百七十五架；遭到三次袭击的边和机场，总共损失了飞机二百七十六架，还有近千名美国侵略军伤亡。
    越南南方解放武装力量袭击敌人机场的战术也是变化无穷，时而炮击，时而奇袭，时而埋地雷爆炸；有时是在炮击之后，突击队又神出鬼没地插入机场进行爆炸，然后安全撤退。这些奇妙的打法使敌人防不胜防，一再挨打而毫无办法。在一九六五年里，解放武装力量有时还同时袭击敌人的两个或三个机场，使敌人首尾不能相顾，损失更加惨重。如去年十月二十七日，解放武装力量同时袭击在广南省的岘港的诺曼机场和朱莱机场，一举击毁敌机一百五十七架，歼灭美军五百八十多人。解放武装力量有时还紧密配合，连续袭击，使胆颤心惊的美国侵略者没有喘息的机会，如去年七月一日和二日两天中，他们就五次奇袭了岘港、朔庄、波来古、绥和（富安省）等机场。
    据新华社河内十二日电　越南《人民报》十一日发表社论强调指出，越南南方人民武装没有空军，也能够消灭美国的庞大的空军力量，越南南方军民两年多来袭击敌人机场的辉煌胜利，已经给美国侵略者吹嘘的所谓“绝对空军优势”以沉重的打击。
    社论说，没有空军而仍然能够消灭敌人的庞大的空军力量，这是人民革命战争的奇迹。
    越南《人民军队报》十一日也发表评论指出，越南南方解放武装力量在短时间内成功地袭击一系列美军机场的辉煌战绩，再一次说明了人民战争的伟大威力，说明越南南方解放武装力量有能力战胜拥有最现代装备的任何敌人。
