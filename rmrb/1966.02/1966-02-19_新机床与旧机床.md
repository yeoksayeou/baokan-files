    New Machine Tools and Old Machine Tools
    Planer Worker Chen Dexiang
    Our planing group has five lathes. Among them, one is a domestically produced new-style 650-type bullhead planer. All precision work is handled by this "precious lathe," which other lathes cannot do. In the past, I operated this new planer. Once, when processing the clutch of a lift, I thought its parallelism was good, so I just clamped the work and started. Who knew the work wasn't properly aligned, and the result was crooked, producing a defective product. Later, I was transferred to work on an old lathe. This lathe was an old fellow that had been used for one or two decades, and it was even converted from a belt-driven lathe. I thought to myself, "Just use the broken lathe for rough work." Since the new high tide of production, the factory's precision work has increased, and one "precious lathe" simply couldn't handle it all, forcing the old lathes to step up. When the leaders assigned me to make a pneumatic chuck, I said, "This work requires fifth-grade precision, and it's very complicated to process. The original 'precious lathe' hasn't even done it before, how can my 'old ox-cart' do it?" The leaders repeatedly persuaded me to break away from old conventions, overcome difficulties in every possible way, and produce good work on the old lathe. I thought about it and felt I could give it a try. Production tasks are urgent, and we can't just stick to an old almanac. Afterwards, our group of workers conducted a "consultation" on the old equipment, identified its problems, and prescribed the right remedy. Originally, we were using pliers to clamp the work, which was not accurate in angle. Later, we successfully reformed a small fixture, and we were also more meticulous in operation. As a result, the work we produced was even more precise than the work I had done on the good lathe in the past, and there were no defective products.
    Good equipment and bad equipment, doing good work and doing bad work, can be transformed under certain conditions. In this transformation process, people are the decisive factor.

    新机床与旧机床
    刨工　陈德祥
    我们刨工组有五台床子，其中有一台是国产新式650型牛头刨床，凡是加工精密活，都由这台“宝贝床子”包办，别的床子干不了。过去，我就操纵这台新刨床。有一次加工升降机的离合器时，我满以为它的平行度好，卡上活就干，谁知活没有找正，干出来就歪了，出了废品。以后，我被调到一台旧床子上干活，这台床子是用了一二十年的老家伙，还是由皮带床子改装的，我心里想，破床子破用呗。生产新高潮以来，工厂的精密活增加了，一台“宝贝床子”说啥也吃不了，逼着旧床子上阵。当领导分配我做气动卡具时，我就说：“这个活要求五级精度，加工起来很复杂，原来的‘宝贝床子’还没干过哩，我这台‘老牛破车’哪能干。”领导上再三对我说服教育，让我打破老框框，千方百计克服困难，要在旧床子上干出好活来。我想来想去，觉得可以试试看，生产任务要紧，总不能捧着一本老黄历不放。事后，我们小组的工人对旧设备进行了一次“会诊”，找出它的毛病来，对症下药。原来我们是用老虎钳子夹活，角度不准确，以后改革成功一个小型夹具，在操作上也更精心了，结果加工出的活，比我过去在好机床上干出来的活还精密，也没出废品。
    好设备和坏设备，干好活和干坏活，在一定条件下可以转化。在这种转化过程中，人是决定性的因素。
