    Work Hard to Remold the Subjective World
    Using Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror, I have repeatedly examined myself and feel a great gap between him and me. I must first learn his revolutionary spirit of thoroughly transforming his own thinking with Mao Zedong Thought.
    I am a new recruit among the county party secretaries. Going straight from a brigade party branch secretary to a county party secretary, I felt that the burden was very heavy, and I was always a little timid. After studying Comrade Jiao Yulu's heroic deeds and the People's Daily editorial, I deeply felt that as long as we study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and have his spirit of thorough revolution and wholeheartedly serving the people, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome, no disasters that cannot be defeated, and no tasks that cannot be completed. Therefore, I must always take Comrade Jiao Yulu as a role model for myself.
    In the past few days, I have used Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror to examine myself repeatedly, and I feel that there are still many great gaps between myself and Comrade Jiao Yulu. I want to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu sincerely and honestly in four aspects.
    First, learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit of thoroughly transforming his own thinking in studying Chairman Mao's works. He studied well, used it in a lively way, especially using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly transform himself and establish a firm proletarian world outlook. Looking back at myself, although I have put some effort into studying Chairman Mao's works in the past, I have used it more to transform the objective world and less to transform the subjective world; more to help others and less to transform myself. Therefore, in the depths of my mind, there are still the words "I" and "self." In the future, I will study Chairman Mao's works better like Comrade Jiao Yulu, put great effort into the word "use," and put great effort into transforming my own subjective world, so that I can truly become a good cadre of Chairman Mao.
    Second, learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's lofty ideals of completely changing the face of Lankao County and his ambition to dare to despise difficulties and subdue dragons and tigers. I served as a branch secretary in Nanliu for more than eight years. Because I lacked both lofty ideals and comprehensive planning, I did not completely change the face of Nanliu. Now the Party and the people have placed the heavy responsibility of the county's work on my shoulders again. I want to be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, establish the lofty ambition of rearranging the mountains and rivers of Jiang County: work with the people of the whole county, continue to work hard, and completely change the natural landscape of Jiang County. Jiang County also has "three harms," which are drought, thinness (referring to the thinness of the land), and barrenness (lack of trees). Recently, the Jiang County Party Committee, in light of the characteristics of the county, has proposed a five-year plan that includes the seven characters of water, soil, fertilizer, trees, livestock, electricity, and industry, striving to basically achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization in agricultural production and transportation.
    Third, I want to be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, always maintain the true qualities of the working people, always share the same destiny and breathe the same air with class brothers, and always take the suffering of the poor and lower-middle peasants as our own suffering, and the happiness of the poor and lower-middle peasants as our own happiness. In work, compare with the highest, and in life, compare with the most bitter, and always be a student of the masses. I want to always adhere to the "three togethers," eating in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, living in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, not eating special meals, and not living in good houses. At the same time, we must participate in labor in a down-to-earth manner, and truly achieve what Comrade Jiao Yulu did, how much mud is on the bodies of the poor and lower-middle peasants, so much mud must also be on my body.
    Fourth, I want to be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, continue to carry forward the Party's work style of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, consulting with the masses in everything, and following the mass line. In the leading body of the county party committee, we must adhere to collective leadership and fully promote democracy. We must bear hardships before others and enjoy comforts after others, strictly demand ourselves, respect comrades, care for comrades, and always be modest and prudent, put down our airs, learn from all comrades, and learn their strengths.
    Learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu means using his revolutionary spirit in our current work. At present, Jiang County is setting off a mass upsurge of strengthening wheat field management. The county party committee has transferred more than 500 cadres, led by seven members of the county party committee standing committee, to go deep into the countryside and fight together with the broad masses to strive for a better harvest of grain and cotton production in Jiang County this year.

    在改造主观世界上狠下功夫
    我用焦裕禄同志这面镜子，反复对照检查自己，感到同他的差距很大。我首先要学习他用毛主席思想彻底改造自己思想的革命精神。
    我是县委书记里的一个新兵。从一个大队党支部书记一下当了县委书记，我觉得这个担子非常沉重，心里一直有点胆怯。学习焦裕禄同志的英雄事迹和人民日报社论以后，我深切地感到，只要象焦裕禄同志那样活学活用毛主席著作，有他那种彻底革命完全为人民服务的精神，就没有克服不了的困难，就没有战胜不了的灾害，就没有完不成的任务。所以，我一定要把焦裕禄同志永远当做自己学习的榜样。
    这几天，我用焦裕禄同志这面镜子，把自己反反复复对照检查了一番，感到自己跟焦裕禄同志相比，还有很多很大的差距。我要在四个方面诚诚恳恳、老老实实地向焦裕禄同志学习。
    首先，学习焦裕禄同志在学习毛主席著作中彻底改造自己思想的革命精神。他学得好，用得活，特别是他以毛主席思想为武器，彻底改造自己，树立坚定的无产阶级世界观。回想我自己，过去虽然对学习毛主席著作，用了点功；但是，学了以后用于改造客观世界多，用于改造主观世界少；用于帮助别人多，用于自我改造少。所以，在我的思想深处还有“我”字和“私”字。今后，我要象焦裕禄同志那样更好地学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，在改造自己主观世界上狠下功夫，使自己真正成为毛主席的好干部。
    其次，学习焦裕禄同志彻底改变兰考县面貌的远大理想和敢于蔑视困难、敢于降龙伏虎的雄心壮志。我在南柳当了八年多支部书记，由于既缺乏远大理想，又缺乏全面规划，没有把南柳的面貌彻底改变过来。现在党和人民又把全县工作的重担放在我的肩上。我要象焦裕禄同志那样，树立起重新安排绛县山河的豪情壮志：同全县人民一道，不断努力，把绛县的自然面貌彻底改变过来。绛县也有“三害”，是旱、薄（指地薄）、荒（没有树）。最近，绛县县委针对本县特点，提出了一个包括水、土、肥、树、畜、电、工七个字的五年规划，争取在农业生产和交通运输方面基本实现机械化半机械化。
    第三，我要象焦裕禄同志那样，永远保持劳动人民的本色，永远和阶级弟兄同命运共呼吸，永远以贫下中农的苦为苦，以贫下中农的乐为乐。工作上要和最高的比，生活上要和最苦的比，永远当群众的小学生。我要永远坚持“三同”，吃在贫下中农家里，住在贫下中农家里，不吃偏饭，不住好屋。同时，要踏踏实实地参加劳动，真正做到象焦裕禄同志那样，贫下中农身上有多少泥，我的身上也要有多少泥。
    第四，我要象焦裕禄同志那样，继续发扬党的相信群众、依靠群众、遇事和群众商量、走群众路线的工作作风。在县委的领导班子中，要坚持集体领导，充分发扬民主。自己要吃苦在先，享受在后，严格要求自己，尊重同志，关心同志，永远谦虚谨慎，放下架子，向所有的同志学习，把他们的长处学到手。
    学习焦裕禄同志就要把他的革命精神用到当前工作上。目前，绛县正掀起一个群众性的加强麦田管理的高潮。县委已抽调五百多名干部，在七名县委常委的带领下，深入农村和广大群众共同奋战，争取今年绛县粮棉生产有一个更好的收成。
