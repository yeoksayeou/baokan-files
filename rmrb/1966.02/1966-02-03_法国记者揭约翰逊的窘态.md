    French Reporter Reveals Johnson's Embarrassment
    Johnson never looked so gaunt, crestfallen, and gloomy when announcing the resumption of bombing; his tone was like reciting a requiem in a church.
    The French newspaper *Le Monde* published an article on February 2 by its Washington correspondent, Alain Clément, entitled "President Johnson's Failure," excerpts of which are translated below:
    The United States used means that it itself no longer believes in to convince the world of its determination. The resumption of bombing, whether strategically or morally, has not been able to garner strong public support for their arguments.
    Returning to the previous status quo and resuming the war in both Vietnams due to pressure from strict paramilitary considerations (disappointment with the failure of "gradual escalation" and a desire for revenge are also factors) is an admission of failure for President Johnson. His facial expression when he read his decision on television already indicated this admission. He never looked so gaunt, crestfallen, and gloomy. His tone was like reciting a requiem in a church.
    In Washington, paralyzed by the snow, the disappointment caused by the message announced in the cautiously worded communiqué, which had long been revealed, outweighed the surprise. The dominant feeling is that people are very sad, everyone is talking about it, and the resumption of bombing itself is a tragedy. For a country that constantly uses grand words like "ideal," "illusion," and "imagination" in public rhetoric, even returning to the old ways after being fully prepared is tantamount to admitting that people are at a loss and unable to save the inevitable. However, people cannot do what is possible, cannot distinguish between major and minor matters, and furthermore, attributing all of this to other people (the Vietnamese Communists and the Chinese) causes invisible confusion. Therefore, the first reaction of Congress was to remain silent about President Johnson's statement. The real debate will begin later, but a debate of conscience has already begun.

    法国记者揭约翰逊的窘态
    约翰逊在宣布恢复轰炸声明时，从来没有这样的消瘦、灰溜溜和阴郁，他的声调活象是在教堂里念祭文
    法《世界报》二日发表它驻华盛顿特派记者阿兰·克勒芒的文章，题为《约翰逊总统的一次失败》，摘译如下：
    美国为了使全世界相信它的决心，使用了连它自己都不再相信的手段。恢复轰炸无论在战略上、还是在道义上，都没有能够使他们的论据得到公众的强有力支持。
    回到以前的现状和出于严格的准军事考虑（“逐步升级”失败的失望和要报仇的情绪也是因素之一）的压力而恢复在两个越南的战争，对约翰逊总统来说是供认已经失败。在他在电视上宣读他的决定的声明时，他的脸部表情已表明了这种供认。他从来没有这样的消瘦、灰溜溜和阴郁。他的声调活象是在教堂里念祭文。
    在由于大雪而瘫痪了四分之三的华盛顿，早已有所透露的措辞审慎的公报所宣布的消息引起的沮丧情绪大于惊奇的情绪。占主导地位的感觉是，人们很悲哀，大家都议论纷纷，恢复轰炸本身就是一个悲剧。对于一个在公众口头上离不开“理想”、“幻想”和“想象”这种伟大字眼的国家来说，甚至在经过充分准备后又恢复老样子，这等于承认人们不知所措、人们无能为力来挽救必不可免的事。但是，人们又不能作出可能作的事，不能分清主要和次要的事，此外，把这一切说成是另外的人（越共和中国人）的过错，这一点引起了看不见的混乱。因此，国会的第一个反应是，对约翰逊总统声明保持沉默。真正的辩论将在以后开始，但是，现在已开始一场良心的辩论。
