　　Sweeping Away Garbage
    The Royal Government of Cambodia has expelled the last remaining American organization in Cambodia, the "Asia Foundation." This is another resolute action by the Cambodian people, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, in their struggle to oppose American imperialist aggression and safeguard independence and sovereignty.
    American imperialism has long shown ill intentions towards the Kingdom of Cambodia and is the most ferocious enemy of the Cambodian people. Recently, it has intensified its efforts by instructing its lackeys in Thailand and Saigon to carry out frequent invasions and provocations against Cambodia. As Prince Sihanouk said, "In this situation, is it any wonder that the Cambodian people hate American imperialists so much?"
      The "Asia Foundation" is an agency of American imperialism carrying out subversive and aggressive activities in Asian countries. Its activities in Cambodia would certainly be no exception, and its criminal activities would only be even more rampant. Since the established policy of American imperialism is to carry out aggression, interference, and subversion against the Kingdom of Cambodia, how can one imagine that such an American organization with a dirty mission would remain in Cambodia to do something good? The Royal Government of Cambodia has done the right thing by cutting off the last finger of the American imperialists' evil hand reaching into Cambodia.

　　扫垃圾
    柬埔寨王国政府赶走了在柬埔寨剩下的最后一个美国组织“亚洲基金会”。这是柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王领导下，坚持反对美帝国主义侵略、维护独立和主权的斗争又一果敢的行动。
    美帝国主义早就表明对柬埔寨王国不怀好意，是柬埔寨人民最凶恶的敌人。最近以来，它更是变本加厉地指示泰国和西贡的走狗对柬埔寨进行频繁的入侵和挑衅。正如西哈努克亲王所说的，“在这种情况下，柬埔寨人民恨透了美帝国主义者，这又有什么奇怪呢？”
      “亚洲基金会”是美帝国主义在亚洲国家进行颠覆和侵略活动的一个代理机构，它在柬埔寨的当然也不会例外，而且它的罪恶活动只会是更加猖獗。既然美帝国主义的既定政策是对柬埔寨王国进行侵略、干涉和颠覆，怎么可能设想这样一个负有肮脏使命的美国组织会留在柬埔寨是为了要做什么善事？柬埔寨王国政府斩断美帝国主义伸进柬埔寨的魔手的最末一个指头，实在做得对。
