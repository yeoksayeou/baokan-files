    He is Our Political Section Chief
    Liu Yuying, Deputy Section Chief of Production Scheduling Section, Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant
    I spent more than eight years with Comrade Jiao Yulu, and in those years, he had a profound influence on me.
    When Comrade Jiao Yulu came to our section as the section chief, I was the scheduling team leader. I remember one Saturday evening, not long after he came to the section, he visited my home and suddenly asked me, "Old Liu, you've been in charge of production scheduling for so many years, what's your biggest feeling in your work?" I said without hesitation, "Doing our job, one is the mouth, the other is the legs. The mouth must be able to speak, the legs must be able run, and you must always remember the production plan, parts blanks, and attending scheduling meetings..." Before I could finish, he said, "These things need to be kept in mind, but there's another important thing that you don't have in your mind." When he said that, I was stunned. Seeing that I had nothing to say, he said, "You must remember that this important thing is Mao Zedong Thought." As he spoke, he took out two copies of the "Red Flag" magazine from his pocket and instructed me to study two relevant articles carefully. Later, although I studied these two articles, there wasn't much change in my actual work. One day, Comrade Jiao Yulu said to me again, "Old Liu, didn't I say that we in production cannot only talk about parts and numbers? The more we talk about these, the more everyone argues, and the less motivated they become. We should talk more about policies and guidelines. Schedulers should not only be good runners, but also good propagandists. Only in this way can we boost people's enthusiasm."
    In his actual work, Comrade Jiao Yulu also did this. I often saw him not going home late at night. After a busy day, he would always sit down to study, either studying Chairman Mao's works or studying party documents and newspaper editorials. He often said, "If you don't thoroughly understand the spirit from above, how can you mobilize the masses to complete the production tasks?" He did this himself and asked others to do the same. At a production scheduling meeting he chaired, Jiao Yulu didn't talk about plans or parts, but put a piece of paper in front of everyone, and then he said, "Let's have an exam today. The question is: 'What is the central task of the entire factory this year? What action slogans have the factory party committee recently put forward?'"
    When Comrade Jiao Yulu said this, some people felt strange and disapproved, saying, "Production meetings don't talk about production, what's the use of this exam?" After the exam, some people handed in blank papers. Jiao Yulu stood up with the papers and said to everyone, "I didn't deliberately give everyone a difficult problem, but I wanted to use the exam to make everyone more deeply aware of this issue: If the leading cadres of a workshop do not understand the central task of the entire factory, do not understand the intention of the Party Committee, and cannot distinguish the priority of the work, that is to say, if they do not use politics to lead the business, it is difficult to guarantee the comprehensive completion of the national plan."
    From then on, at every meeting he would first read a passage from Chairman Mao's works or a Party newspaper editorial to everyone. Over time, we found a pattern. Every time we had a meeting, Jiao Yulu didn't announce the content, but as long as he read a passage from Chairman Mao's works or a Party newspaper editorial, we could figure out the content of the meeting. In this way, we had a deep impression: Comrade Jiao Yulu is a political section chief.

    他是我们的政治科长
    洛阳矿山机器厂生产调度科副科长　刘玉营
    我和焦裕禄同志相处了八年多，在这八年多的时间里，他对我的影响是很深的。
    焦裕禄同志到我们科里当科长时，我是调度组长。记得，他到科里不久的一个星期六晚上，到我家里串门子，突然问我：“老刘呀，你管生产调度这么多年，在工作中的最大感受是什么？”我当时毫不考虑地说：“干咱这一行，一个是嘴，一个是腿，嘴要能说，腿要能跑，心里还要经常记着生产计划，零件毛坯、开调度会……”没等我说完，他说：“这些是要记在心里，但还有一个重要的东西，你心里没有。”他这一说，我直发愣。他看我没的说了，就说：“你要记住，这个重要东西就是毛泽东思想。”他一边说，一边就从衣兜里掏出两本《红旗》杂志，并指定其中两篇有关的文章要我好好学习。后来，我虽然学了这两篇文章，但在实际工作中变化不大，焦裕禄同志有一天又对我说：“老刘呀，我不是说过吗，我们管生产的，不能光讲零件，讲数字。越讲这些，大家越扯皮，干劲也就越来越小。我们要多讲政策，多讲方针，调度员不光要当好跑腿员，还要当好宣传员。只有这样，才能把人的干劲鼓起来。”
    在实际工作中，焦裕禄同志也是这样做的。我经常见他深更半夜不回家。他总是忙碌一天以后，就坐下来学习。不是学习毛主席著作，就是学习党的文件和报纸社论。他经常说：“不吃透上头精神，怎么发动群众完成生产任务？”他自己这样做，也要求别人这样做。在一次他主持的生产调度会议上，焦裕禄一没讲计划，二没讲零件，而是在每一个人面前放上一张纸，然后他说：“今天先来个考试。题目是：‘今年全厂的中心任务是什么？最近厂党委提出了那些行动口号？’”
    焦裕禄同志这样一说，有的人觉得奇怪，很不以为然地说：“生产会议不讲生产，考试这有啥用？”考试后，有人交了白卷，焦裕禄拿着卷子站起来对大家说：“我不是故意给大家出难题，而是想通过考试，让大家更深入地明确这么一个问题：一个车间的领导干部，如果心中不了解全厂的中心任务，不了解党委的意图，工作分不出个轻重缓急，也就是说，不用政治带业务，那是很难保证全面完成国家计划的。”
    从这以后，每次开会他就先给大家念一段毛主席著作，或读一段党报社论。这样时间长了，我们就摸着了一条规律，每次开会，焦裕禄没有宣布内容，只要念一段毛主席著作或党报社论，我们就可以琢磨出会议内容来。这样，我们有了一个深刻的印象：焦裕禄同志是个政治科长。
