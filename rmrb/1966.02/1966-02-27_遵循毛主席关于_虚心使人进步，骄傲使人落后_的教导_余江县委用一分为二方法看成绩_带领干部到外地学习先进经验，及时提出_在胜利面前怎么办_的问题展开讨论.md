　　Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "modesty helps one to make progress, pride makes one lag behind"
　　Yujiang County Party Committee uses the method of "one divides into two" to view achievements
　　Leading cadres to study advanced experiences in other places, and promptly raising the question of "what to do in the face of victory" for discussion
    Editor's note: Is it to view work achievements with the method of "one divides into two," or with the metaphysical method? This is a very important question.
    To view work achievements with the metaphysical method is to regard work achievements as unchanging, which will lead to carrying burdens, the stagnation of work, and the danger of turning victory into failure.
    The Yujiang County Party Committee regards work achievements as a thing of the past, as a new starting point for future work, which is the same as "starting from zero." Yujiang County looks for shortcomings in achievements, leads cadres to study advanced experiences in other places, and promptly raises the question of "what to do in the face of victory," educating cadres to strictly follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "modesty helps one to make progress, pride makes one lag behind." All these practices are correct. Only in this way can work continue to move forward and can one continue to achieve one victory after another.
    This newspaper reports: According to the Jiangxi Daily, the Yujiang County Party Committee recently raised the question of what to do in the face of victory, and organized cadres and masses throughout the county to展开 discussion, requesting cadres and masses throughout the county to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, work conscientiously, guard against arrogance and rashness, modestly learn from the advanced experiences of other places, carry forward the Dazhai spirit, and strive to make even greater achievements this year on the basis of continuous production increases for four consecutive years.
    Under the leadership of the Party, the cadres and masses of Yujiang County have overcome one difficulty after another and achieved one victory after another in the struggle to unremittingly transform nature and develop agricultural production. Last year, the average per-mu yield of rice in the county reached the level of the National Agricultural Development Program, becoming one of the national Dazhai-style agricultural models. Currently, all parts of the province are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee to study the revolutionary spirit and advanced experience of the Baitaqu Canal (Baitaqu Canal water management experience, see the first page of the People's Daily on December 3, 1965), and to study and research the experience of Yujiang County in increasing agricultural production. Under this situation, the cadres of Yujiang County have even more firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "modesty helps one to make progress, pride makes one lag behind," paying attention to the gaps and weaknesses in their work, seeing that although the county's grain production has increased more than in the past, the unit yield of summer grain and autumn grain differs greatly; cotton and oil crops are still in a low-yield state; hog development is slow, and diversified operations are not well done; afforestation is an even weaker link. Guided by Mao Zedong Thought, the Yujiang County Party Committee organized cadres at all levels to seriously study advanced experiences in other places with problems, and led the party secretaries of various communes and farms to visit and study in Hua County of Guangdong Province and Qu County of Zhejiang Province; it organized the party branch secretaries of all brigades in the county to learn from the Xincun Brigade led by Comrade Peng Guangxian of Xiangdong Commune in Pingxiang City the experience of farming for the revolution and farming scientifically to achieve high yields; to the Mawangtang Brigade in Yichun County to learn the experience of mountain management and afforestation; and to the Shinao Commune in Gaoan County to learn the experience of developing pig raising and diversified operations. It also introduced to the cadres and masses of the county the advanced thinking and advanced deeds of many other advanced units in the province. At the same time, it also organized cadres at all levels to launch heated discussions around the question of "what to do in the face of victory."
    Through visits, studies, and discussions, the cadres of Yujiang County adopted a "one divides into two" attitude towards their work, seeing both the achievements and the gaps, recognizing that the county's production and work are still at a low level compared with some advanced regions, and that the imbalance between regions and projects is even more prominent. Some cadres said: "The Party lists our Yujiang as one of the national Dazhai-style agricultural models, which is not only an honor given to us by the Party, but also a higher demand placed on us. If we lie on 'honor' and do not move, the advanced will become backward." Everyone expressed that they would hold the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, make persistent efforts, advance victoriously, and strive to be better and better.
    The discussion of the question of "what to do" by the cadres and commune members at the grassroots level throughout the county is generally divided into three stages: The first stage focuses on discussing how to correctly treat honor and how to view the achievements that have been made historically and dialectically. Through propaganda and discussion, everyone should clarify that the achievements come from the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and from the common hard work of all commune members and cadres; recognize that our existing achievements are only the first step in the Long March compared with the great cause of communism; and recognize that in the movement of comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing, we must guard against arrogance and rashness, modestly learn from the advanced experiences of other places, work and labor with redoubled efforts, further carry forward the Dazhai spirit, and strive for greater victories. The second stage focuses on discussing what should be done in the future? First, mobilize cadres and commune members to democratically summarize the production work of the commune and team last year, and while affirming the achievements, seriously find gaps and investigate the reasons, and the main thing is to find ideological gaps and analyze the reasons for ideological gaps; then, in light of the existing problems, study solutions, specifically discuss the production increase measures for the commune and team to continue to leap forward, and implement this year's production increase plan. In the third stage, combined with the appraisal of "six-good communes and teams" and "six-good commune members," further carry out the movement of comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing, fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, and launch a new upsurge of production, striving to achieve this year's production plan.

　　遵循毛主席关于“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导
　　余江县委用一分为二方法看成绩
　　带领干部到外地学习先进经验，及时提出“在胜利面前怎么办”的问题展开讨论
    编者按：用一分为二的方法看待工作成绩？还是用形而上学的方法看待工作成绩？这是一个十分重要的问题。
    用形而上学的方法看待工作成绩，就会把工作成绩看成是不变的，就会背上包袱，工作就会停止不前，就有从胜利变成失败的危险。
    中共余江县委把工作成绩看作是已经过去的事情，看作是今后工作的新的起点，这和“从零开始”是同样的道理。余江县有了成绩找缺点，带领干部到外地学习先进经验，及时地提出“在胜利面前怎么办”的问题，教育干部严格遵循毛主席的“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，所有这些作法，都是正确的。只有这样，才能使工作不断前进，才能不断取得一个又一个的胜利。
    本报讯　据江西日报报道：最近，中共余江县委提出了在胜利面前怎么办的问题，组织全县干部和群众展开讨论，要求全县干部和群众要更加高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，兢兢业业，戒骄戒躁，虚心学习外地的先进经验，发扬大寨精神，在连续四年增产的基础上，力争今年作出更大的成绩。
    在党的领导下，余江县的干部和群众在坚持不懈地改造大自然、发展农业生产的斗争中，克服了一个又一个的困难，取得了一个又一个的胜利。去年全县水稻平均亩产达到了全国农业发展纲要的水平，成为全国大寨式农业典型之一。当前，全省各地都在热烈响应省委、省人委的号召，学习白塔渠的革命精神和先进经验（白塔渠水利管理经验，见一九六五年十二月三日人民日报第一版），学习和研究余江县农业增产的经验。在这种形势下，余江县的干部更加牢记毛主席关于“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，注意自己工作中的差距和薄弱环节，看到全县粮食生产虽然比过去增加较多，但夏粮与秋粮单产却相差很大；棉花、油料仍处于低产状态；生猪发展较慢，多种经营搞得不好；治山造林更是一个薄弱环节。中共余江县委以毛泽东思想为指导，组织各级干部带着问题，认真学习外地的先进经验，率领各公社、农场党委书记到广东省花县、浙江省衢县参观学习，组织了全县大队支部书记，到萍乡市湘东公社彭光贤同志领导的新村大队学习为革命种田，用科学种田，实现高产的经验；到宜春县马王塘大队学习治山造林的经验，到高安县石脑公社学习发展养猪和多种经营的经验，并向本县干部和群众介绍了本省其它许多先进单位的先进思想和先进事迹。同时，还组织了各级干部，围绕着“在胜利面前怎么办”的问题，展开了热烈的讨论。
    通过参观学习和讨论，余江县的干部对自己的工作采取了一分为二的态度，既看到了成绩，更看到了差距，认识到全县的生产和工作同一些先进地区比还是低水平的，地区之间、项目之间的不平衡性更是突出。有的干部说：“党把我们余江列为全国大寨式农业典型之一，这不仅是党给我们的荣誉，也是向我们提出了更高要求，如果我们躺在‘荣誉’上不动，先进就要变为后进了。”大家都表示要更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，再接再厉，乘胜前进，争取好上加好。
    全县基层干部和社员群众对于“怎么办”这个问题的讨论，大体分为三段进行：第一段着重讨论怎样正确对待荣誉，怎样历史地、辩证地看待已经取得的成绩。通过宣传和讨论，使人人明确成绩来自党和毛主席的领导，来自全体社员和干部的共同艰苦奋斗；认识到我们已有的成绩，同伟大的共产主义事业相比，只不过是万里长征的第一步；认识到在比学赶帮超运动中，必须戒骄戒躁，虚心学习外地先进经验，加倍努力工作、劳动，进一步发扬大寨精神，争取更大的胜利。第二段着重讨论今后应当怎么办？首先发动干部、社员，民主总结本社、队去年生产工作，在肯定成绩的同时，认真找差距，查原因，而主要的又是找思想上的差距，分析思想差距的原因；然后针对存在的问题，研究解决的办法，具体讨论本社、队继续跃进的增产措施，落实今年增产计划。第三段，结合评比六好社队、六好社员，进一步开展比学赶帮超运动，充分调动干群革命积极性，掀起新的生产高潮，为实现今年生产计划而努力。
