    Bundy's Boast
    After returning to Washington from Saigon, Johnson's special assistant McGeorge Bundy said that the United States now has more reason to be hopeful about the situation in Vietnam than it did more than a year ago. "Then we were going downhill, now we are going uphill."
    Bundy's boast is only laughable. But if the so-called "going uphill" means that the United States will further "escalate" and expand the war, then that is accurate. However, the result can only be "going downhill" faster than it was more than a year ago.

    邦迪的牛皮
    约翰逊的特别助理麦·邦迪从西贡回到华盛顿后说，现在美国比一年多以前较有理由对越南局势抱有希望，“那时是在走下坡路，现在走上坡路了。”
    邦迪的牛皮只能令人发笑。但如果所谓“走上坡路”，是指美国将进一步“升级”扩大战争，那倒是确切的，不过，其结果只能比一年多以前更快地“走下坡路”。
