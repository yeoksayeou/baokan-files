　　On "Xie Yao Huan"
　　He Qifang
　　"Xie Yao Huan" is a Peking Opera script written by Comrade Tian Han in 1961. It is adapted from a traditional play. Among the characters, Wu Zetian, Wu Sansi, Lai Junchen, and Xu Yougong are historical figures, but the main character Xie Yao Huan and the related plot are fictional.
　　Comrade Tian Han greatly emphasized the educational role of historical dramas. In "The Handling of Subject Matter," he said: "The main task of historical drama writers is to create moving historical figure images that can educate today's people based on historical truth." In "Sending 'Guan Hanqing' to Visit Korea," he further opposed the view that "historical dramas can only reflect historical truth and are irrelevant to the current struggle," saying, "Historical dramas can still reflect the current real struggles and may exert a powerful practical significance under certain circumstances." What Comrade Tian Han said naturally also applies to "Xie Yao Huan."
　　So, let us examine what kind of characters Comrade Tian Han's "Xie Yao Huan" uses to "educate" today's readers and audiences? What kind of "current real struggle" does it "reflect"?

    Should Not Beautify Wu Zetian and Her Cronies

　　"Xie Yao Huan" opens with a fierce debate between Xie Yao Huan and Wu Sansi, a debate over whether to adopt a policy of "appeasement" or "suppression" towards the peasant uprising. A peasant uprising broke out in Taihu. Wu Sansi strongly advocated "military suppression." Xie Yao Huan advocated stopping the encroachment on land, and "appeasing" and "settling" the uprising peasants. Wu Zetian asked her how she knew about the situation in the South. She replied:
    This humble servant is from Jiangnan. My late father was a village teacher. He sent back thousands of words in his will, and every word made people think deeply. Since the dynasty implemented the equal-field system, in recent years, the good laws and intentions have been mostly abandoned. Powerful families and nobles have annexed land, forcing the people to wander. More than one-tenth have fled, taking their children and wives to remote mountains and seas. If the army goes south, I fear that the universe will be filled with killing. It is better for Your Majesty to bestow grace, appease the people and secure the country, and stop the powerful and enforce strict laws, so that farmers can get land and the hungry can get food; then Jiangnan and Jiangbei will be full of spring, and songs will be sung in praise of the wise reign.
　　How did Wu Zetian handle this dispute? She said to Xie Yao Huan, "What you have said is very much in line with my intentions." So, she sent her to inspect Jiangnan. When Xie Yao Huan inspected Suzhou, she discovered that Wu Sansi's son, Wu Hong, had seized the peasants' permanent fields, and colluded with Cai Shaobing, Lai Junchen's half-brother, to rob women. Xie Yao Huan killed Cai Shaobing, flogged Wu Hong forty times, and ordered him to return the land within a time limit. Wu Hong and other powerful nobles jointly accused Xie Yao Huan of colluding with the Taihu uprising army. Wu Sansi and Lai Junchen falsely conveyed Wu Zetian's "oral decree" and used torture to interrogate Xie Yao Huan in Suzhou. By the time Wu Zetian heard about it and rushed there, Xie Yao Huan had been tortured to death. Wu Zetian was very angry and executed Wu Hong and Lai Junchen, and Wu Sansi was also demoted. When reprimanding Wu Sansi, she proclaimed, as if speaking of herself, that she "hated powerful families and nobles annexing land and exploiting the people."
　　What does Comrade Tian Han tell us through such characters? He first tells us that within the feudal ruling class, although there are bad people like Wu Sansi and Lai Junchen, there are also emperors like Wu Zetian, and cronies and representatives of the emperor like Xie Yao Huan, who have consistently opposed powerful families and nobles annexing land and exploiting the people, who have consistently considered the exploited and oppressed peasants, who do not consider it a crime for peasants to rise up in rebellion, and that this crony and representative of the emperor is willing to sacrifice her life for such a spirit. This is the first "education" that Comrade Tian Han's "Xie Yao Huan" gives us!
　　When peasant uprisings broke out in the feudal dynasty, the idea of "appeasement" did appear. But "suppression" and "appeasement" have always been the two-pronged strategy of the feudal ruling class to oppose peasant uprisings. Although there are two sets of strategies, the goal is the same: to eliminate the peasant uprising army. If they cannot "suppress" it, they propose "appeasement." If they cannot achieve their goal through "appeasement," they still "suppress." To describe the emperor's crony's advocacy of "appeasement" for the peasant uprising as stemming from a genuine and deep sympathy for the peasants, to the point that she does not even trust the emperor's "forbidden army," fearing that they will suppress the peasant uprising, causing "the people to suffer even more," and the emperor praises it, saying "very much in line with my intentions," this is nothing more than Comrade Tian Han's beautification of the highest head and decision-maker of the feudal ruling class!
　　When land annexation developed very seriously in feudal society, the advocacy of opposing annexation and suggesting "land limitation" did appear, and the so-called "equal-field system" was once implemented in some feudal dynasties. Dong Zhongshu of the Han Dynasty once suggested to Emperor Wu of Han, Liu Che, to "limit the people's land ownership" and "block the path of annexation." However, the purpose of his suggestion was: "Then it can be well governed," which is to strengthen the feudal rule. During the time of Emperor Xiaowen of the Northern Wei Dynasty, Yuan Hong, Li Anshi proposed "equal land distribution," and Yuan Hong adopted his suggestion. Later, the Northern Qi, Northern Zhou, Sui, and early Tang dynasties all once implemented the "equal-field system." However, according to existing historical materials and the research results of some historians, we can see that the essence and role of this "equal-field system" of the feudal dynasty is only this:
　　First, it is for the benefit of the feudal ruling class, to consolidate feudal rule. The actual purpose is to bind the peasants to the land, increase the labor force and tax revenue that the feudal state can control.
　　Second, "equal land distribution" is not equal division of land, and does not touch the private land ownership of landlords. It is only a set of maximum amount of land that can be legally owned according to feudal rank; in the case that the feudal state controls more official land and wasteland, it allows some landlords and peasants to use part of the official land and wasteland in accordance with the law.
　　Third, the result of the implementation of this "equal-field system," although it can restore and develop production to a certain extent, its implementation area and degree are very limited due to various reasons. Many historical records record that the actual land owned by the general public is far from the prescribed figures, and cannot solve the problem of landlessness or land scarcity for the vast number of peasants. In addition, the sale and encroachment of land can be carried out through various legal and illegal means. While the "equal-field system" is implemented, annexation still exists, and the continued development of annexation is bound to be the destruction and negation of this system.
　　Existence determines consciousness. When we examine the ideology, system, and other superstructure of any era, we must see that they are the product of a certain economic base, and we must see that in class society, they are all class-based, and serve certain classes and class struggles. Wu Zetian is a feudal emperor. How could she "consistently struggle with powerful families and nobles"? Isn't the emperor the highest, largest, and richest powerful noble? Could she actually represent the interests of the vast number of exploited and oppressed people at that time?
　　In recent years, there has been a saying that Wu Zetian represents the interests of small and medium landlords or "gentry landlords" or some "emerging landlords," and opposes "aristocratic landlords" or the privileged large landlord class. Comrade Tian Han may say that he is based on this. There are contradictions between different strata within the feudal ruling class. Moreover, many of the powerful nobles or large landlords with privileges can also have contradictions with the entire feudal state. For example, if they occupy too much land and labor force, it will reduce the feudal state's tax revenue and the manpower that can be conscripted for corvée labor. Some politicians of the feudal ruling class often propose to oppose annexation, and sometimes they are adopted by certain emperors. The secret lies here. However, the feudal state, as the machine of dictatorship of the entire feudal ruling class, cannot only represent one of its strata, and fundamentally oppose other strata within it. The feudal emperor can only oppose a part of the powerful nobles, but cannot oppose all the powerful nobles; he can only carry out some restraint on them at certain times when the contradiction between the interests of many powerful nobles and the interests of the entire feudal state intensifies. He cannot "consistently struggle with powerful families and nobles." Wu Zetian is exactly like this. She only attacked and suppressed those powerful nobles who opposed her, the Li Tang clan, and those who supported the Li Tang clan and opposed her, but not all the powerful nobles.
　　Feudal historians oppose Wu Zetian from the standpoint of feudal orthodox ideology. This should be overturned. But it is absolutely not possible to rehabilitate a feudal emperor to become a representative and protector of the people's interests. All emperors are the highest heads of the exploiting class. This is their commonality, which cannot be blurred. Then, it is also necessary to distinguish whether they are relatively enlightened emperors or unenlightened emperors, and whether they have contributed to the development of history or not. The political measures of relatively enlightened emperors often benefit the economic and cultural development at that time and are often more contributive. Although Wu Zetian has some relatively enlightened political measures, such as her employment of some talents, and sometimes accepting the opinions of others, in general, she is only a mediocre conservative monarch, and cannot be said to have made any great contribution to the historical development of our country.

    The Nature of the Thought of "Petitioning for the People"

　　Comrade Tian Han's "Xie Yao Huan" beautifies Wu Zetian, but the later development of the plot also made certain criticisms of her. He unreservedly eulogized Xie Yao Huan, Wu Zetian's confidante, decision-maker, and representative.
　　In the script, Comrade Tian Han did not explain what class standpoint Wu Zetian took when she "consistently struggled with powerful families and nobles," but he pointed out Xie Yao Huan's class basis and ideological basis for why she could "embody" this spirit and be willing to sacrifice her life for this spirit.
　　We quoted a passage from Xie Yao Huan's aria earlier. She said that her father was a village teacher. Many village teachers in feudal society were small and medium landlords. Comrade Tian Han probably meant that she came from the class of small and medium landlords or a lower class in society. That's why she could fight the powerful families and nobles so resolutely. However, people's actions are not all determined by their family origins. Even more important is the class status they occupy. Xie Yao Huan has already flown to a high branch, becoming a figure trusted and reused by the emperor. Can she only represent the interests of the social class she came from? She can only oppose those powerful families and nobles who oppose her and her master. She cannot oppose all powerful families and nobles. She can only make certain "struggles" when the contradiction between the interests of many powerful nobles and the interests of the entire feudal state intensifies. She cannot "consistently struggle with powerful families and nobles."
　　What is the ideological basis of Xie Yao Huan as written by Comrade Tian Han? It is "petitioning for the people." In the first scene of the play, after Xie Yao Huan had a fierce dispute with Wu Sansi, she said to Wu Zetian: "May Your Majesty forgive this humble servant for offending the princes and dukes." Wu Zetian said: "What crime is there in petitioning for the people?" Their relationship is like this: Xie Yao Huan "embodies Wu Zetian's spirit of consistently struggling with powerful families and nobles," and Wu Zetian supports Xie Yao Huan's thought of "petitioning for the people." To write that Xie Yao Huan is both loyal to the people and loyal to the feudal emperor, which is originally an irreconcilable contradiction, Comrade Tian Han uses such a relationship to "combine them into one."
　　To vigorously eulogize and promote "petitioning for the people" through the character of Xie Yao Huan, who occupies the protagonist's position in the work, this is the second "education" that Comrade Tian Han's "Xie Yao Huan" gives us!
　　In the ruling class of feudal society, many people who "petitioned for the people" did appear. However, we must also conduct class analysis on the idea of "petitioning for the people," and we must also examine which class it serves.
　　We can see from historical records that there are many different specific reasons for "petitioning for the people." Sometimes it is because land annexation has developed very seriously, sometimes it is because heavy taxes and levies make it impossible for people to live, sometimes it is advising the emperor not to be extravagant, and sometimes it is requesting "relief" after serious disasters or wars. But there are several common points among them:
　　First, those who "petition for the people" all saw from the social life at that time that "the people cannot bear their fate" and felt that the rule of their class was in danger. Therefore, the purpose of their "petitioning" was to ease class contradictions and consolidate feudal rule.
　　Second, although they said some sympathetic words about the suffering of the people, and sometimes even said them quite fiercely and painfully, because they stood on the position of the feudal ruling class that exploited and oppressed the people, they despised the people.
　　Third, their "petitioning" was only limited to begging the emperor, and they only placed their hopes on the emperor's "benevolence." If the people rose up to rebel and solve the problem of not being able to live on their own, they would all be deeply disgusted, attacked, and cursed.
　　In this way, the nature of their "petitioning for the people" is very clear: it does not represent the interests of the people, but stands on the position of the feudal ruling class, serving to consolidate feudal rule; it cannot truly solve the problems of the people at that time, but at most can only promote the feudal ruling group at that time to take some reformist measures; therefore, if those appeals and requests are realized, although they can temporarily and partially alleviate some of the people's suffering, they generally play a role in paralyzing and deceiving the people. How can our writers today eulogize the thoughts and actions of such people who "petition for the people"?
　　Marx and Engels said in "The German Ideology":
　　The matter is like this: Every new class that attempts to replace the position of the old ruling class,
　　In order to achieve its goals, it has to portray its interests as the common interests of all members of society, and abstractly speaking, give its ideas a universal form,
　　Depict them as the only reasonable and universally meaningful ideas. Confucianism, which occupied the dominant position in our feudal society, was exactly like this. When the feudal ruling class rose to replace the slave-owner class, it put forward a whole set of political theories and moral and ethical concepts, depicting them as universal truths and portraying the interests of the feudal ruling class as the interests of all members of society. If it is said that in the beginning, the rise of the feudal ruling class was a progress compared to the rule of the slave owners, and was in line with the needs of historical development, then later, when feudal relations of production became an obstacle to social development, it was still completely deceiving to think that the dark and cruel feudal rule could become an ideal kingdom. However, many politicians and thinkers in our feudal society were deeply influenced by Confucianism. They saw from real life that the bloody facts were not as beautiful and reasonable as the fantasies fabricated by the Confucian doctrines they believed in. Among them, there were often people who stood up and "petitioned for the people," even not fearing the emperor's demotion, imprisonment, and beheading. If we do not see clearly the nature and essence of their thoughts and actions, these phenomena can be deceptive.
　　Of course, if we see clearly their class nature and are not deceived by them, these historical records can also play a role in exposing feudal society today. Some literary works in ancient China also have the color of "petitioning for the people." We should also point out the nature and essence of the subjective thoughts of those authors, and then recognize that those works have a certain exposing effect. In addition, there are some works whose writing is not for requesting and begging from the emperor and feudal authorities, but the suffering of the people in real life deeply moved them, and they had to speak out. In this way, their works become a social accusation. These works are often written more profoundly and movingly, so their exposure is greater, and it should be said that they no longer belong to the scope of "petitioning for the people" mentioned here.
　　However, what we have analyzed above is only the nature of the "petitioning for the people" of many figures of the ruling class in feudal society. Comrade Tian Han is not an ancient writer. Why is he vigorously eulogizing and promoting "petitioning for the people" today? What is he "speaking for" "current needs," and what kind of "current real struggle" is he "reflecting"?
　　People's propositions, slogans, and theories have their original background, basis, and content, and there are also situations where they are used by people of that time and later generations.
　　Everyone should still remember that when the bourgeois rightists and other anti-Party and anti-socialist elements attacked us, they often adopted the posture of "petitioning for the people" to express their deep hatred for socialism. Even on the eve of the rampant attack by the bourgeois rightists, in July and November 1956, Comrade Tian Han published two articles in "Drama Newspaper," "We Must Truly Care About and Improve the Lives of Artists" and "Petitioning for the Youth of Actors." He also used the form of "petitioning for the people" to distort facts and exaggerate shortcomings, describing our new society as a dark world, and thus attacking the Party. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries in Hong Kong reprinted these two articles and distributed them in various theaters. In 1957, the people who provided materials for these two articles by Comrade Tian Han, that is, those people for whom Comrade Tian Han "petitioned," many of them became rightists. It turned out that Comrade Tian Han was acting as a spokesperson for right-wing elements and dissatisfied elements. After that, these two articles were verbally criticized by some comrades.
　　"What crime is there in petitioning for the people?" It turns out that this is not only Comrade Tian Han's advocacy of "petitioning for the people" for the feudal ruling class in ancient times, but more importantly, it is his defense and counterattack against the criticism he received for having "petitioned" for right-wing elements and dissatisfied elements.
　　Does Comrade Tian Han really not know the error and reaction of his "petitioning for the people"? Then we can also solemnly tell Comrade Tian Han:
　　First, "petitioning for the people" has a premise, which is the endless exploitation and oppression of the people by the feudal ruling class, and the frequent and large-scale existence of the reality of "the people cannot bear their fate." Our people's democratic dictatorship today is the people's own regime. Although the poor and blank state of our country can only be gradually changed, and although our work is inevitably prone to this or that shortcoming, the problem of "the people cannot bear their fate" simply does not exist in our society. Our people will manage their own country and solve their own problems, and there is no need for anyone to "petition" for them. Comrade Tian Han's advocacy of "petitioning for the people" today is to compare socialist society to a society ruled by exploiting classes, and to compare our Party and government to the ruling groups of exploiting classes. This is first and foremost an intolerable slander.
　　Second, "petitioning for the people" in feudal society does not stand on the position of the people, but on the position of the feudal ruling class. Today, using this form to attack the Party and the proletarian dictatorship is not only placing oneself above the people, but also placing oneself outside the Party and the government, which are the most capable of representing the people. That is to say, it is placing oneself in the position of the opposition. In the eyes of such people, it seems that only they represent the people, and the Party and the people are opposed to each other. Comrade Tian Han is a Communist Party member, but he places himself in the position of the opposition and regards the Party and the people as opposed to each other. Isn't this an extremely serious error?
　　Third, since the people today are the masters of the country, and the Party and the people are completely consistent, the Party and the government can only be the most capable of representing the people. Comrade Tian Han places himself in the position of the opposition. What exactly are the "people" he is "petitioning" for? It can only be the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and other dissatisfied elements with stubborn bourgeois ideas. Only they feel that they cannot tolerate the proletarian dictatorship and socialism, and they urgently hope that someone will "petition" for them. Whether Comrade Tian Han is willing or unwilling, he has actually placed himself in the ranks of this reactionary united front.
　　This is the essence of today's "petitioning for the people." In socialist society, the spokesmen of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie want to attack the Party and the proletarian dictatorship. It is impossible to openly declare that it is for the interests of their own class. They always appear in the form of speaking on behalf of the people to carry out "legal struggle." Therefore, it can only be concluded that to advocate and implement the so-called "petitioning for the people" in socialist society is thoroughly reactionary and thoroughly anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-people.

    To Whom is the "Warning" Addressed?

　　The blueprint of "Xie Yao Huan," whether it is "Wan Fu Lian" or "Female Inspector," originally had a comedic ending. Comrade Tian Han changed it to a tragic ending. His reason is: "I think that handling it this way at present has a deeper educational significance." Why is a tragic ending "more educationally meaningful"? There can only be the following two explanations: To more strongly eulogize and promote "petitioning for the people." "Petitioning for the people" is worth sacrificing our lives for, and it is such a noble thought and behavior! If not, or if not only so, it is to more strongly highlight such a "lesson": When bad people are in power, good people will be killed by bad people, and even if there is a correct policy, it cannot be implemented. I think that the "more profound educational significance" that Comrade Tian Han said is mainly here.
　　Comrade Tian Han said in the "Preface" that some people advocated deleting the last scene of "Xie Yao Huan," but he insisted on keeping it. Why was he reluctant to part with it? I think it is because this scene highlights this "educational significance." In fact, the plot of the entire play is enough to illustrate such a meaning. Comrade Tian Han is still afraid that people will not understand, and he still wants to give a final point to the topic, and finally give a face-to-face lesson through a character in the play.
　　Yuan Xingjian, who married Xie Yao Huan, his role in the play is not only to realize the policy of dealing with the peasant uprising advocated by Xie Yao Huan by sending him to Taihu to "appease" them, but more importantly, he is a supplement to the positive figures in Comrade Tian Han's mind. The script expresses such an idea through this character: either "petition for the people" like Xie Yao Huan, not afraid of death; or do not cooperate with the rulers like Yuan Xingjian. To promote this latter idea today is also reactionary. This is also another way of opposition that disgruntled people may take today. In addition, Comrade Tian Han also assigned this character an important task, which is to give a "summary" of the entire play after Xie Yao Huan's death, and to put forward a "warning." When the play is about to close, someone conveys Wu Zetian's "oral decree" to Yuan Xingjian, asking him to "go to Luoyang to meet her immediately for another reward." He said:
　　I am a commoner. What reward do I want? With Yao Huan's death, my heart has been broken. When I see the emperor, I will ask her to open her ears and eyes, adopt loyal advice, so that the people can have the joy of striking the earth, and there will be no suffering. If she favors traitors and harms loyal people again, I am afraid that the world will be in trouble from now on.
　　We want to ask: To whom is this "warning" addressed? Is it addressed to Wu Zetian? Is it addressed to the feudal dynasty? Is it addressed to Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan? I don't think Comrade Tian Han is so confused, and no audience or reader will be so confused. It can only be addressed to our Party and government.
　　Bad people are in power, good people will be killed by bad people. Not only can correct policies not be implemented, but also "I am afraid that the world will be in trouble from now on." This is the third "education" that Comrade Tian Han's "Xie Yao Huan" gives us, and it can also be said to be the overall "education" formed by the plot story of the entire play!
　　In the feudal dynasty, there was indeed often a so-called struggle between loyalty and treachery, and there were often times when "the world was in trouble." However, this is not a general description of Wu Zetian's rule, but it is put forward as a "lesson" that is like a finishing touch when the entire play is about to close. Is this a random stroke, not to let today's audience and readers "get enlightenment," not to "speak for current needs"?
　　In our socialist society, of course, there are also good people and bad people. However, we have our standards for distinguishing good people from bad people. People who are wholeheartedly serving the people and serving socialism are the best people today. People who undermine the socialist cause are bad people. Many heroic figures and advanced figures, such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, Jiao Yulu, and Mai Xian, have received great attention and praise from the Party and the people, and have become models for the whole country to learn from. The Party and the people have always been in constant struggle with all kinds of bad people who undermine the socialist cause. Therefore, in our society, there is simply no such problem as "favoring traitors and harming loyal people" in feudal society. Comrade Tian Han insisted on putting forward such a "lesson" from feudal society to us. What exactly does he mean? Who are the "loyal people" he implied today, and who are the "traitors" today? This cannot but lead people to such an explanation: Those right-wing elements, dissatisfied elements, and people like himself for whom he "petitioned" are the "loyal people" in his mind; and those who defend the Party and defend socialism, who rise up and resolutely struggle with the rightists, those who adhere to principles and criticize his mistakes are the "traitors" in his mind.
　　In our work, sometimes the Party's policies are not well implemented due to the impurity of certain grassroots organizations, and more often due to the lack of understanding of some cadres. However, our policies represent the interests and demands of the people in a concentrated way. They are thoroughly revolutionary and are sincerely supported by the vast number of masses and cadres, so they will eventually be implemented. Our policies are fundamentally different from the reformist "good laws and intentions" of the feudal ruling class eulogized by Comrade Tian Han; even if they are temporarily not well implemented at certain times, they are fundamentally different from the set of systems and policies of the feudal ruling class that exploit and oppress the people.
　　Comrade Tian Han obliterates all these fundamental differences, but wants to use the past to satirize the present, and issue a "warning" to us, saying that if we "favor traitors and harm loyal people again," not only will "good laws and intentions" not be implemented, but also "I am afraid that the world will be in trouble from now on." What does "the world will be in trouble" mean? Isn't Comrade Tian Han actually threatening us with the people rising up to rebel? The new China created by the blood and sacrifice of millions of people under the leadership of the Party has, in Comrade Tian Han's view, reached the point where it is in crisis like the feudal dynasty, and the people are about to rise up to rebel. All these completely unwarranted comparisons and attacks are not a very vicious slander and attack on the Party and the proletarian dictatorship?
　　Why did Comrade Tian Han think of "the world will be in trouble" when he wrote "Xie Yao Huan"? What kind of "current real struggle" did he "reflect"? This can only be answered by linking it to the situation at that time. From 1959 to 1961, the country suffered severe natural disasters in succession, and certain shortcomings and errors also occurred in our work. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries united to oppose China. At that time, we encountered difficulties that had never been seen since the founding of the country. Those three years of difficulty were a severe test for all kinds of people. The Chinese people successfully passed this test. However, there were also people like Comrade Tian Han who could not withstand the test during the attack of the bourgeois rightists and became their spokesmen. During the three years of difficulty, they could not withstand the test and launched a vicious attack on the Party and the proletarian dictatorship. The only difference from the last time is that this time the form adopted is more hidden, and an arrow like "Xie Yao Huan" is released to satirize the present by referring to the past. The people are about to rise up to rebel. This is his view of the situation during the three years of difficulty. "Petitioning for the people" is the way of "legal struggle" he proposed in response to the situation at that time.
　　To describe the feudal emperor and her confidantes and representatives as representatives and protectors of the people's interests; to advocate and promote "petitioning for the people," and thus regard the relationship between our Party and the people today as the same as the antagonistic relationship between the feudal ruling group and the people; to compare the three years of difficulty to a crisis in the feudal dynasty, to slander that bad people are in power in our society, so that correct policies cannot be implemented, and to threaten us that if this situation is not changed, the people will rise up to rebel—this is the ideological content of "Xie Yao Huan." These three ideological contents are more reactionary than the other.

    On the Evaluation of Historical Figures and the Question of Historical Drama

　　We use Marxism as a guide to study history, and we must re-evaluate historical figures and historical events. Past erroneous evaluations should be overturned. We should correct the reversal and distortion of history by the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, and restore its original appearance. However, only the people are the driving force of history. We should first rehabilitate the people, not first rehabilitate the emperors, generals, and ministers. Emperors, generals, and ministers whose past evaluations are wrong can also be rehabilitated, but they cannot be said to be representatives and protectors of the people's interests. Our re-evaluation or rehabilitation must have a standard. The question is whether it is the standard of Marxism or the standard of anti-Marxism.
　　Taking Wu Zetian as an example, from the earliest saying that men and women "fundamentally have two kinds of blood" in their bodies, and thus using "women's resistance and struggle" to rehabilitate her, to the recent years' view that she represents the interests of small and medium landlords or "gentry landlords" or some "emerging landlords," and thus "conforms to the laws of historical development," and even saying that she is "the greatest woman in history," there are really all kinds of views, except for the class view of the proletariat.
　　Taking Hai Rui as an example, the feudal historians had already praised him enough, but Comrade Wu Han still felt that it was not enough, and he wrote article after article to eulogize him, until he "broke out of the door" and wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office."
　　From the records left by feudal historians, the class nature of these historical figures can still be seen to some extent, whether it is Wu Zetian or Hai Rui. But in the hands of certain historians and writers today, their class nature is not revealed more clearly, but more blurred. Why are they so interested in the figures of the feudal ruling class, and why do they eulogize them without limit? What standard are they using?
　　Comrade Wu Han once put forward the standard for evaluating historical figures. He said in "On the Evaluation of Historical Figures":
　　First, is the evaluation of historical figures based on the standard of today and here, or based on the standard of that time and there?
　　This question seems very simple. Most people will say that of course it should be based on the latter, but in practice, they often forget it and use the former to measure the ancients.
　　What exactly is the "standard of that time and there"? In our feudal society, "that time and there" had neither the proletariat nor Marxism. The claim that only the "standard of that time and there" can be used means that the standard of the proletariat Marxism is not needed. It seems that Comrade Wu Han has confused two different things: when we evaluate historical figures, we must pay attention to the historical conditions in which he lived, and we cannot examine his thoughts and behaviors without considering the historical conditions at that time. This is of course correct. This is what we call the historical viewpoint; however, this is by no means equal to, and absolutely cannot be called, the "standard of that time and there"; moreover, this is not a standard for evaluating historical figures at all. Calling this an evaluation standard can only be said to be a mismatch. To evaluate historical figures from the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of the proletariat Marxism, this is our proposition, and this is of course the standard of today.
　　The historical viewpoint is only one of our viewpoints. The evaluation of historical figures cannot only rely on this viewpoint. If you put historical figures in certain historical conditions for examination, if it is only like this, without another viewpoint, what result can you examine? Speaking of the standard of evaluation, there must be different standards for different classes. If it is not the standard of the proletariat, it is the standard of the bourgeoisie or the landlord class. Putting historical figures in certain historical conditions for examination, it is still necessary to first use the class viewpoint and use the class analysis method. The ruling class in the past, in different historical periods, in its rising period and its declining period, has different roles. Therefore, when we use the class analysis method, we do not abandon the historical viewpoint. To oppose the Marxist historical materialism or historical viewpoint to the class viewpoint and the class analysis method, and to use the former to cancel the latter, this is completely wrong.
　　In "On the Evaluation of Historical Figures," Comrade Wu Han also said that "we must pay attention to class relations and use the class analysis method to study historical figures"; however, he immediately said, "but we cannot absolutize it and regard class composition as the only measure for evaluating historical figures." Below, he talked a lot about what "some people evaluate historical figures with a purely component-based theory, which is a big mistake," and so on. It seems that the class analysis he understands is

　　评《谢瑶环》
　　何其芳
    《谢瑶环》是田汉同志一九六一年写的京剧剧本。它是根据传统剧改编的，其中武则天、武三思、来俊臣、徐有功都是历史人物，谢瑶环这个主要人物及其有关情节却是虚构。
    田汉同志是很强调历史剧的教育作用的。他在《题材的处理》中说：“史剧作家的主要任务是在于根据历史真实创造出足以教育今天人民的动人的历史人物形象。”他在《送〈关汉卿〉访朝》中更提出反对“历史剧只能反映历史真实，与现实斗争无关”的看法，他说：“历史剧照样可以反映当前的现实斗争，也可能在一定情况下发挥强大的现实意义。”田汉同志所说的这些话，自然也适用于《谢瑶环》。
    那么我们就来考察一下，田汉同志的《谢瑶环》到底是用什么样的人物形象来“教育”今天的读者和观众？到底是“反映”了什么样的“当前的现实斗争”？
    不应该美化武则天及其亲信
    《谢瑶环》一开幕就展开了谢瑶环和武三思之间的激烈的争论，对农民起义采取“抚”的政策还是“剿”的政策的争论。太湖爆发了农民起义。武三思力主“征剿”。谢瑶环却主张制止侵占土地，“抚慰”、“安置”起义农民。武则天问她是怎样知道南方的情况的，她回答：
    婢子本是江南籍，先父是乡村一教师。寄来遗谕数千字，字字叫人发深思。自先朝推行均田制，近年来良法美意多废弛。豪门贵族兼并土地，只逼得百姓颠沛流离。逃亡何止十之一，山陬海涯挈儿带妻。倘若大军南去，怕只怕乾坤动杀机。还不如陛下施恩惠，抚慰黎民安社稷，制止豪强严法制，使耕者得田饥得食；那时节江南江北皆春意，笙歌一片颂明时。
    武则天是怎样处理这个争论呢？她对谢瑶环说：“你所奏各节深合朕意。”于是派她巡按江南。谢瑶环巡按到苏州，发现武三思的儿子武宏侵夺农民的永业田，又和来俊臣的异父同母兄弟蔡少炳勾结，抢劫妇女。谢瑶环杀了蔡少炳，杖责武宏四十，并限期要他退田。武宏和别的豪门贵族联名告谢瑶环私通太湖起义军。武三思、来俊臣假传武则天的“口谕”，到苏州用酷刑拷问谢瑶环。等到武则天听说赶来的时候，谢瑶环已经被折磨死了。武则天很愤怒，把武宏和来俊臣处死，武三思也贬了官。在训斥武三思的时候，她宣扬自己似地说她“生平痛恨豪门贵族兼并土地，鱼肉百姓”。
    田汉同志通过这样的人物形象告诉我们什么呢？他首先告诉我们：在封建统治阶级里面，虽然有武三思、来俊臣那样一些坏人，但也有武则天这样的皇帝，谢瑶环这样的皇帝的亲信和代表，他们是一贯反对豪门贵族兼并土地、鱼肉人民的，他们是一贯为被剥削被压迫的农民着想的，他们是农民起来造反也不以为罪的，而且这个皇帝的亲信和代表是不惜以生命来殉这样的精神的。这就是田汉同志的《谢瑶环》给我们的第一个“教育”！
    在封建王朝爆发了农民起义的时候，是的确出现过“抚”的主张的。但“剿”和“抚”从来都是封建统治阶级反对农民起义的两手策略。策略虽有两套，目的却是一个：都是为了消灭农民起义军。他们“剿”不了就提出“抚”，他们“抚”不能达到目的就还是“剿”。把皇帝的亲信对农民起义主张“抚”描写为是出于对农民的真正的深切的同情，以至对皇帝御用的“禁军”也不放心，怕他们去镇压农民起义，使“百姓涂炭越不堪”，而皇帝却大加赞赏，说“深合朕意”，这不过是田汉同志对于封建统治阶级的最高头子和决策人的美化！
    在封建社会的土地兼并发展得很厉害的时候，是的确出现过反对兼并和建议“限田”的主张，而且在某几个封建王朝还一度实行过所谓“均田制”的。汉朝的董仲舒就曾对汉武帝刘彻建议过“限民名田”，“塞兼并之路”。然而他建议的目的却是：“然后可善治也”，也就是加强封建统治。北魏孝文帝元宏的时候，李安世更提出“均田”，元宏采纳了他的建议。以后北齐、北周、隋和唐初期，都曾一度实行过“均田制”。但是，根据现存的史料和有些历史学者的研究结果，我们可以看出，这种封建王朝的“均田制”的实质和作用不过是这样：
    第一，它是为了封建统治阶级的利益，为了巩固封建统治。实际的目的是为了把农民束缚在土地上，增加封建国家所能掌握的劳动力和赋税收入。
    第二，“均田”并不是平分土地，并不触犯地主土地私有制。它不过是按照封建等级来规定一套合法占有土地的最高额；在封建国家掌握较多的官地和荒地的情况下，允许某些地主和农民按照法令使用部分官地和荒地。
    第三，这种“均田制”实行的结果，虽然可以一定程度地恢复和发展生产。然而由于种种原因，它实行的地区和程度都是很有限度的。许多史料都记载了一般人民实际有的土地和规定的数字相差很远，并不能解决广大农民的无地少地问题。再加上土地的买卖、侵占可以通过种种合法和非法的方式进行，在实行“均田制”的同时就仍然存在着兼并，而兼并的继续发展就必然是这种制度的破坏和否定。
    存在决定意识。我们考察任何时代的思想、制度和其他上层建筑，都必须看到它们是一定的经济基础的产物，必须看到在阶级社会里，它们都是有阶级性的，都是为一定的阶级和阶级斗争服务的。武则天是一个封建皇帝，她怎么会“一贯与豪门贵族斗争”呢？难道皇帝不是最高、最大、最富有的豪门贵族吗？难道她居然可以代表当时被剥削被压迫的广大人民的利益吗？
    近几年来，出现了这样一种说法，说武则天代表中小地主或者“庶族地主”或者什么“新兴地主”的利益，反对“世族地主”或者具有特权的大地主阶层。田汉同志或许说他是以这为根据。封建统治阶级内部的不同阶层是有矛盾的。而且其中的许多豪门贵族或者说有特权的大地主还可以和整个封建国家有矛盾，比如他们占有土地和劳动力过多，就会使封建国家的赋税和可以征用来从事徭役的人力减少。封建统治阶级的某些政治家常常提出反对兼并，而且有时为某些皇帝所采纳，秘密就在这里。然而封建国家作为整个封建统治阶级专政的机器，不可能只代表它的某一个阶层，而从根本上去反对它内部的其他阶层。封建皇帝只可能反对一部分豪门贵族，不可能反对一切豪门贵族；他只可能在某些时候，在许多豪门贵族的利益和整个封建国家的利益的矛盾尖锐化的时候，对他们进行若干抑制，不可能“一贯与豪门贵族斗争”。武则天正是这样，她打击和镇压的仅仅是那些反对她的豪门贵族，李唐宗室和那些拥护李唐宗室反对她的人，绝不是一切豪门贵族。
    封建历史学者从封建正统思想出发来反对武则天，这是应该翻案的。但绝不可以把一个封建皇帝翻案到成为人民利益的代表者和保护者。一切皇帝都是剥削阶级的最高头子，这是他们的共性，这是不能模糊的。然后才是也要区别他们是比较开明的皇帝还是不开明的皇帝，他们对历史的发展是有贡献还是没有贡献。比较开明的皇帝的政治措施常常有利于当时的经济和文化的发展，常常是比较有贡献的。武则天虽然有部分的比较开明的政治措施，比如为人们所肯定的，她曾用过一些人才，有时也还接受别人的意见等等，但总的说来，她不过是一个中等的守成之君，对我国的历史发展也说不上有什么大的贡献。
    “为民请命”思想的性质
    田汉同志的《谢瑶环》美化武则天，但后来发展的戏剧情节又对她作了一定的批评。对谢瑶环这个武则天的亲信、决策人和代表，却是毫无保留地歌颂。
    在剧本里，田汉同志没有交代武则天“一贯与豪门贵族斗争”是站在什么阶级立场上；但谢瑶环为什么能够“体现”这种精神，能够不惜以生命来殉这种精神，他却是点明了她的阶级基础和思想基础的。
    我们在前面引过谢瑶环的一段唱词。她说她父亲是乡村一教师。封建社会的乡村教师很多是中小地主。田汉同志大概是说她出身于中小地主阶层或更下层的社会，所以她能够那样坚决地和豪门贵族斗争。但是，人们的行动并不都决定于家庭出身，更重要的还是他们本人所处的阶级地位。谢瑶环已经飞到高枝儿上去了，成为皇帝信任和重用的人物了，她还能只代表她所出身的那个社会阶层的利益吗？她也是只能反对那些反对她和她的主子的豪门贵族，而不可能反对一切豪门贵族，只能在许多豪门贵族和整个封建国家的利益的矛盾尖锐化的时候作某些“斗争”，不可能“一贯与豪门贵族斗争”的。
      田汉同志所写的谢瑶环的思想基础又是什么呢？那就是
  “为民请命”。剧本第一场，谢瑶环和武三思发生了激烈的争论之后，她向武则天说：“愿陛下恕婢子触犯王公。”武则天说：“为民请命，何罪之有。”她们的关系就是这样：谢瑶环“体现武则天一贯与豪门贵族斗争的精神”，武则天支持谢瑶环的“为民请命”的思想。要写谢瑶环既忠于人民，又忠于封建皇帝，这本来是一个无法统一的矛盾，田汉同志却以这样的关系来把它们“合二而一”了。
    通过谢瑶环这个在作品中居于主人公地位的人物形象来极力歌颂、提倡“为民请命”，这就是田汉同志的《谢瑶环》给我们的第二个“教育”！
    在封建社会的统治阶级里面，是出现过许多“为民请命”的人物的。但是，对“为民请命”的思想我们也是必须进行阶级分析的，也是必须考察它到底是为什么阶级服务的。
    我们可以从历史记载里面看到，引起“为民请命”的具体原因有多种多样，有时是由于土地兼并发展得很厉害，有时是因为横征暴敛使得人民活不下去，有时是劝告皇帝不要穷奢极欲，有时是在灾情严重或战乱之后，请求“赈济”，但其中有这样几个共同点：
    第一，那些“为民请命”的人都是从当时的社会生活看到了“民不堪命”，感到了本阶级的统治有危险，因此，他们“请命”的目的都是为了缓和阶级矛盾，巩固封建统治；
    第二，尽管他们对人民的痛苦说了一些同情的话，有时甚至说得相当激烈、沉痛，但因为他们是站在剥削和压迫人民的封建统治阶级的立场上，他们对人民又是轻视的，鄙视的；
    第三，他们的“请命”只是限于向皇帝乞求，只是把希望寄托于皇帝的“恩赐”；如果人民起来造反，起来自己解决活不下去的问题，他们都是深恶痛绝的，攻击咒骂的。
    这样，他们的“为民请命”的性质就非常清楚了：它并不是代表人民的利益，而是站在封建统治阶级的立场上，为巩固封建统治服务的；它并不可能真正解决当时人民的问题，而是至多只能促使当时的封建统治集团采取某些改良主义的措施；因此，那些呼吁、乞求如果实现了，虽然可以暂时地局部地减轻人民的某些痛苦，总的说来，却又起了麻痹人民和欺骗人民的作用。我们今天的文学家怎么可以歌颂这种“为民请命”的人物的思想和行动呢？
    马克思和恩格斯在《德意志意识形态》中说：
    事情是这样的，每一个企图代替旧统治阶级的地位的新阶级，
    为了达到自己的目的，不得不把自己的利益说成是社会全体成员的共同利益，抽象地讲，就是赋予自己的思想以普遍性的形式，
    把它们描绘成唯一合理的、有普遍意义的思想。我国封建社会里占统治地位的儒家思想就正是这样。在封建统治阶级起来代替奴隶主阶级的时候，它就提出来了一整套的政治理论和道德伦理观念，把它们描绘成普遍的真理，把封建统治阶级的利益说成是社会全体成员的利益。如果说在最初的时候，封建统治阶级的兴起比之奴隶主的统治是一个进步，是符合历史发展的需要的，那么到了后来，在封建的生产关系成为社会发展的障碍的时候，仍然以为黑暗的残酷的封建统治可以成为理想的王国，那就完全是欺骗了。然而我国封建社会的许多政治家、思想家都受儒家思想的影响很深，他们从现实生活中看到血淋淋的事实一点也不象他们所信奉的儒家学说所编造的幻想那样美好，那样合理，他们中间就常常有人挺身而出，“为民请命”，甚至不怕皇帝贬官、下狱、杀头。如果看不清楚他们的思想和行动的性质、实质，这些现象是可以迷惑人的。
    当然，如果我们看清楚了它们的阶级性质，不为它们所迷惑，这些历史记载在今天也可以起一种揭露封建社会的作用。我国古代有一些文学作品，也带有“为民请命”的色彩。对那些作者的主观思想也应该指出它们的性质、实质，然后是承认那些作品有一定的揭露作用。另外还有些作品，它们的写作并不是为了向皇帝和封建当权派请求、乞求，而是现实生活中的人民的苦难深深地激动了他们，不吐不快，这样他们的作品就成为一种社会的控诉。这种作品往往写得更深刻，更动人，因而它们的揭露作用就更大，应该说它们已经不属于这里所说的“为民请命”的范围了。
    但是，我们以上分析的仅仅是封建社会的许多统治阶级的人物的“为民请命”的性质。田汉同志并不是古代的作家，他在今天来极力歌颂和提倡“为民请命”，又是为什么呢？这又是“针对”什么“当前的需要说话”，“反映”什么样的“当前的现实斗争”呢？
    人们的主张、口号、理论有它们本来的背景、根据和内容，也有为当时和后代的人所利用的情况。
    大家应该还记得，资产阶级右派和其他反党反社会主义分子向我们进攻的时候，就常常采取“为民请命”的姿态，来表现他们对社会主义的刻骨仇恨。就是在资产阶级右派猖狂进攻的前夕，一九五六年七月和十一月，田汉同志在《戏剧报》上发表过两篇文章，《必须切实关心并改善艺人的生活》和《为演员的青春请命》。他也是以“为民请命”的形式，歪曲事实和夸大缺点，把我们新社会描写为一片黑暗，这样来向党进攻。当时在香港的国民党反动派曾把这两篇文章加以翻印，在各剧院散发。一九五七年，给田汉同志的这两篇文章提供材料的人，也就是那些田汉同志为他们“请命”的人，其中很多都成为右派。原来田汉同志是作了右派分子和不满分子的代言人。在这以后，这两篇文章曾受到了一些同志的口头的批评。
      “为民请命，何罪之有？”原来这不但是田汉同志对古代的为封建统治阶级服务的“为民请命”的宣扬，而且更重要的还是他对自己曾经为右派分子和不满分子“请命”因而受到批评的辩护和反攻。
    难道田汉同志真的还不知道他的“为民请命”的错误和反动吗？那么我们也可以严正地告诉田汉同志：
    第一，“为民请命”有一个前提，就是封建统治阶级对人民群众的无穷无尽的剥削和压迫，就是经常的大量存在的“民不堪命”的现实。我们今天的人民民主专政却是人民自己的政权。尽管我们的国家的一穷二白的面貌还只能逐渐改变，尽管我们的工作也难免有这样或那样的缺点，但我们的社会根本不存在什么“民不堪命”的问题。我们的人民会自己管理自己的国家，解决自己的问题，也根本用不着什么人来“为”他们“请命”。田汉同志在今天还来提倡“为民请命”，就是把社会主义社会比拟为剥削阶级统治的社会，就是把我们的党和政府比拟为剥削阶级的统治集团。这首先就是一种不可容忍的污蔑。
    第二，封建社会的“为民请命”不是站在人民的立场而是站在封建统治阶级的立场。今天利用这种形式来向党向无产阶级专政进攻，更是既自居于人民之上，又自居于最能代表人民的党和政府之外，也就是说自居于反对派的地位。在这种人看来，好象只有他们代表人民，党和人民反而是对立的。田汉同志是一个共产党员，却自居于反对派的地位，并把党和人民看作是对立的，这还不是极其严重的错误吗？
    第三，既然今天的人民就是国家的主人，党和人民是完全一致的，最能代表人民的只能是党和政府。田汉同志自居于反对派的地位，他“为”的“民”到底是什么呢？那只能是地富反坏右和其他有顽强的资产阶级思想的不满分子。只有他们才感到对无产阶级专政和社会主义不能忍受，才迫切地盼望有什么人来为他们“请命”。不管田汉同志愿不愿意，他实际上已把自己置身于这个反动的联合战线的行列中去了。
    这就是今天的“为民请命”的实质。在社会主义社会里，地主阶级、资产阶级的代言人要向党进攻，向无产阶级专政进攻，不可能公开声明是为了他们的本阶级的利益，就总是以代表人民讲话的形式出现，来进行“合法斗争”。因此，只能得出这样结论：在社会主义社会里来提倡和实行所谓“为民请命”，是彻头彻尾反动的，是彻头彻尾反党反社会主义反人民的。
    “警告”是对谁提出的？
      《谢瑶环》的蓝本，无论是《万福莲》还是《女巡按》，都本来是喜剧结尾，田汉同志却改为悲剧结尾。他的理由是：“我以为按目前这样处理，教育意义较为深刻”。为什么悲剧结尾就
  “教育意义较为深刻”呢？这只能有以下两种解释：为了更强烈地歌颂和提倡“为民请命”。“为民请命”，这是值得牺牲我们的生命的，它是多么崇高的思想和行为呀！如果不是这样，或者说如果不只是这样，就是为了更强烈地突出这样一个“教训”：坏人当道，好人就会被坏人害死，尽管有正确的方针政策也是不能贯彻的。我认为田汉同志所说的“教育意义较为深刻”主要在这里。
    田汉同志在《小序》上说，有些人主张删去《谢瑶环》的最后一场，但他还是坚持把它保留下来了。他为什么舍不得割爱？我看就是因为这一场点明了这个“教育意义”。其实整个戏的故事情节已足够说明这样的意思了，田汉同志还怕有人不明白，还要最后来一个点题，最后通过一个剧中人物来一通耳提面命的教训。
    和谢瑶环结婚的袁行健，他在剧中的作用不仅是经过他来实现谢瑶环所主张的对待农民起义的政策，派他到太湖去“招安”，而且更重要的他是田汉同志心目中的正面人物的一个补充。剧本通过这个人物表现了这样的思想：要么象谢瑶环一样“为民请命”，死也不怕；要么象袁行健一样不和统治者合作。在今天来宣扬这后一种思想也是反动的。这也正是今天心怀不满的人可能采取的另一种反对方式。另外，田汉同志还派给了这个人物一个重要任务，就是由他在谢瑶环死后来给全剧作“总结”，来提出一个“警告”。在这个戏快闭幕的时候，有人向袁行健传达武则天的“口谕”，要他“速往洛阳见驾，另行封赏”。他说：
    俺乃草野匹夫，要什么封赏？瑶环一死，此心已碎，见了圣上就请她开张视听，采纳忠言，使百姓有击壤之乐，无涂炭之苦。若再宠信奸佞，残害忠良，只怕天下从此多事了。我们要问：这个“警告”是对谁提出的？难道是对武则天吗？难道是对封建王朝吗？难道是对台湾的蒋介石吗？我想田汉同志不会这样糊涂，任何观众和读者也不会这样糊涂。这只能是对我们的党和政府提出的。
    坏人当道，好人就会被坏人害死，不但正确的方针政策不能贯彻，而且“只怕天下从此多事”，这就是田汉同志的《谢瑶环》给我们的第三个“教育”，也可以说是整个戏的情节故事构成的总的“教育”！
    在封建王朝里，的确是常有所谓忠奸之争的，常有“天下多事”的时候的。但是，这并不是对武则天的统治所作的一般的描写，而是放在整个戏快要闭幕的时候，作为一个画龙点睛似的“经验教训”提出来的。难道这反而是闲笔，不是为了让今天的观众和读者“得到启发”，不是“针对当前的需要说话”吗？
    在我们社会主义社会里，当然也是有好人和坏人的。然而我们有我们的区分好人和坏人的标准。忠心耿耿为人民服务、为社会主义服务的人就是我们今天的最好的人。破坏社会主义事业的人就是坏人。象雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、焦裕禄、麦贤得等许多英雄人物和先进人物受到了党和人民的极大的重视、表扬，成为全国学习的模范；对各种各样的破坏社会主义事业的坏人，党和人民从来就是与之作不断的斗争。因此，在我们的社会里，根本就没有封建社会里的那种“宠信奸佞、残害忠良”的问题。田汉同志却硬要把这样一个封建社会的“教训”向我们提出来，到底是什么意思呢？他所暗示的今天的“忠良”是什么人，今天的“奸佞”又是什么人呢？这不能不使人得出这样的解释：他所为之“请命”的那些右派分子、不满分子和他自己那样的人就是他心目中的“忠良”；而那些保卫党保卫社会主义、起而和右派坚决斗争的人，那些坚持原则、对他的错误进行批评的人，就是他心目中的“奸佞”。
    在我们的工作中，有时候由于某些基层组织不纯，更多的时候由于有些干部的认识不够，党的方针政策是有贯彻得不好的情况的。但我们的方针政策集中地代表了人民的利益和要求，是彻底革命的，是为广大的群众和干部衷心拥护的，因而它们终于是会贯彻的。我们的方针政策和田汉同志所歌颂的封建统治阶级的改良主义的“良法美意”根本不同；它们在某些时候还暂时贯彻得不好，也和封建统治阶级那一套剥削人民压迫人民的制度政策根本不一样。
    以上种种根本的差异，田汉同志一概加以抹杀，却要借古讽今，向我们提出“警告”，说什么如果“再宠信奸佞，残害忠良”，不但“良法美意”不能贯彻，而且“只怕天下从此多事”。什么叫做“天下多事”？这不是田汉同志居然以人民要起来造反来威胁我们吗？在党的领导之下，经过千百万人民的流血牺牲才缔造成的新中国，在田汉同志看来，已经到和封建王朝发生危机的时候一样，人民快起来造反了。所有这些完全不应该有的比拟和攻击，还不是对党对无产阶级专政的十分恶毒的污蔑和进攻吗？
    为什么田汉同志在写《谢瑶环》的时候想到了“天下多事”？究竟是“反映”了什么样的“当前的现实斗争”？这是要和当时的形势联系起来才能得到解答的。一九五九到一九六一年，国内连续遭到了严重的自然灾害，我们的工作中也发生了某些缺点和错误，国外帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派联合反华，那时候我们遭到了开国以来从来未有的困难。那三年困难是对各种各样的人的一次严重的考验。中国人民胜利地经过了这次考验。但是，也有象田汉同志这样的人，在资产阶级右派进攻的时候经不起考验，成为他们的代言人；在三年困难时期又经不起考验，对党对无产阶级专政又发动了恶毒的攻击。和上一次不同的不过是这一次采取的形式隐蔽一些，放出了借古讽今的《谢瑶环》这样一支暗箭。人民快要起来造反了，这是他对三年困难时期的形势的看法。“为民请命”，这是他针对当时的形势提出的“合法斗争”的方式。
    把封建皇帝和她的亲信、代表描写为人民利益的代表者和保护者；鼓吹和提倡“为民请命”，并从而把我们今天的党和人民的关系看作是同封建统治集团和人民的对立的关系一样；把三年困难时期比拟为封建王朝发生了危机，诬蔑我们的社会里坏人当道，因而正确的方针政策得不到贯彻，而且威胁我们说，如果这种情况不改变，人民就要起来造反——这就是《谢瑶环》的思想内容。这三个思想内容是一个比一个反动的。
    关于历史人物评价和历史剧问题
    我们以马克思主义为指导来研究历史，对历史人物和历史事件都是必须重新评价的，过去错误的评价是应该翻案的。我们应该纠正地主阶级、资产阶级对于历史的颠倒和歪曲，还它一个本来面目。但是，只有人民才是创造历史的动力，我们首先应该给人民翻案，而不是首先给帝王将相翻案。帝王将相过去评价错误的也可以翻案，但总不能把他们说成为人民利益的代表者和保护者。我们的重新评价或翻案都必须有一个标准。问题就在到底是马克思主义的标准，还是反马克思主义的标准。
    以对武则天来说，从最早的说什么男人和女人身体里面“根本流着两种血”，因而以“女性的反抗及挣扎”来为她翻案，一直到近几年认为她代表中小地主或者“庶族地主”或者什么“新兴地主”的利益，因而“符合历史发展规律”，以至说她是“历史上最伟大的妇女”，这真是什么观点都有，唯独没有无产阶级的阶级观点。
    以对海瑞来说，本来封建历史学者对他的吹捧已经够多了，然而吴晗同志还觉得不够，还要一篇又一篇文章来歌颂他，一直到“破门而出”，写出《海瑞罢官》。
    从封建历史学者所留下的记载里，无论是对武则天还是对海瑞，都多少还可以看出这些历史人物的阶级性。但到了今天的某些历史学家和文学家的笔下，他们的阶级性不是揭露得更清楚，反而更模糊了。为什么对封建统治阶级的人物兴趣那样大，歌颂得那样没有限度呢？到底用的是什么标准呢？
    吴晗同志曾经提出过评价历史人物的标准。他在《论历史人物评价》中说：
    第一，评价历史人物是依据今时今地的标准呢，还是依据当时当地的标准？
    这个问题看来很简单，一般人都会说当然应该依据后者，但在实践中往往忘记了，却用前者来衡量古人。
      “当时当地的标准”到底是什么标准？在我国封建社会里，“当时当地”既没有无产阶级，又没有马克思主义，主张只能用“当时当地的标准”，就是不要无产阶级的马克思主义的标准。看来吴晗同志是把两件不同的事情弄混淆了：我们评价历史人物，必须注意他所处的历史条件，不能脱离当时的历史条件来考察他的思想行为，这当然是对的，这就是我们所说的历史观点；但是，这绝不等于、也绝不能叫作什么“当时当地的标准”；而且这也根本并不是什么评价历史人物的标准。把这叫做评价标准，只能说是牛头不对马嘴。用无产阶级的马克思主义的立场、观点和方法来评价历史人物，这才是我们的主张，这当然也就是今天的标准。
    历史观点仅仅是我们的一个观点，评价历史人物绝不能只依靠这个观点。把历史人物放在一定的历史条件下来考察，如果仅仅是这样，没有另外的观点，你能考察出什么结果来呢？说到评价的标准，那就必然是不同的阶级有不同的标准，不是无产阶级的标准，就是资产阶级或者地主阶级的标准。把历史人物放在一定的历史条件来考察，仍然是首先必须运用阶级观点，运用阶级分析方法。过去的统治阶级，在不同的历史时期，在它的上升时期和没落时期，作用是不同的，因此我们在运用阶级分析方法的时候也并不是就抛开了历史观点。把马克思主义的历史主义或历史观点同阶级观点、阶级分析方法对立起来，并用前者来取消后者，这完全是错误的。
    昊晗同志在《论历史人物评价》里面，也曾说到“要注意阶级关系，运用阶级分析的方法来研究历史人物”；但是，他紧接着又说，“但是不可以绝对化，把阶级成分作为评价历史人物的唯一尺度”。下面他就大讲什么“有些人却以唯成分论来评价历史人物，这就大错特错了”，等等。看来他所理解的阶级分析并不是我们所说的阶级分析，而不过是划分阶级出身。这还不是把马克思主义的阶级分析方法简单化、庸俗化为“唯成分论”，然后来加以批评和反对吗？我们所说的对历史人物的阶级分析，绝不是仅仅考察人们的阶级出身，而是指根据人们所处的实际的阶级地位和他们的思想和活动的实质去揭露它们所代表的实际的阶级利益。马克思在《路易·波拿巴的雾月十八日》中就曾指出这样的事实，“一个阶级在政治方面和著作方面的代表人物同他们所代表的阶级间的关系”是相当复杂曲折的，或者说相当隐蔽的。这样，阶级分析才所以需要进行严肃的认真的研究。如果它仅仅是划分人们的阶级出身，那就简单了，只要能够找到一些能说明人们的阶级出身的材料就够了。
    评价历史人物首先有一个标准问题，不是无产阶级的马克思主义的标准，就必然是资产阶级的或者地主阶级的反马克思主义的标准。吴晗同志的“当时当地的标准”运用到对海瑞的评价上，就是以资产阶级的超阶级的观点和改良主义的观点去评价封建统治阶级的人物，并从而达到了接受一些封建文人的看法。但总的说来，他的评价历史人物的标准仍然是“今时今地”的资产阶级的标准，并不是什么“当时当地的标准”。
    历史剧的写作和传统剧的改编，和评价历史人物一样，也有一系列的问题，需要作专门的研究和讨论。但从《谢瑶环》、《李慧娘》和《海瑞罢官》三个戏看来，也首先有一个方向问题，一个政治标准问题。具体地说，就是为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务、为无产阶级的政治服务，还是不利于工农兵、不利于社会主义、以至反党反社会主义反人民？
    毛泽东同志在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中提出了辨别香花和毒草的六条政治标准。那是我们的文艺创作和学术研究都必须遵循的标准。在不违背六条标准的范围内，我们的文艺工作者和学术工作者本来有广阔的活动的天地。但是，我们的社会里还存在着阶级和阶级斗争，这种斗争不能不反映到文学艺术和学术工作中来，违背这六条标准的毒草又总是要出现的，而且有时还会大量出现。三年困难时期就正是毒草大量生长出来的时期。
    《谢瑶环》、《李慧娘》和《海瑞罢官》，不管它们还有些什么差异，就其根本性质说来，都是反马克思主义、反社会主义的。除了《谢瑶环》和《海瑞罢官》都是美化封建统治阶级的人物而外，这三个戏还有以下几个重要的共同点：
    第一，它们都歌颂和提倡一些超阶级的品德和精神。《谢瑶环》是“为民请命”。《李慧娘》是抽象的“正义”和“复仇”。《海瑞罢官》是“刚直不阿”和反对“乡愿”。歌颂和提倡这些以超阶级的面貌出现的品德和精神，其实都是只能为我们今天的社会里的不甘心退出历史舞台的地主阶级和资产阶级服务的，只能为反党反社会主义的人提供精神支柱。“为民请命”的性质，上面已作了分析。通过李慧娘和海瑞所宣扬的品德和精神也有一些同志进行了批评。问题很清楚，在我们今天的社会里，还感到有什么“正义”没有伸张、还感到需要起而
  “复仇”的，不正是只有被革命剥夺了他们的特权的剥削阶级吗？什么叫做“刚直不阿”？在封建社会里，那是说封建统治阶级中有一种人，对他本阶级里面的他不以为然的人和事表现出倔强的态度，不服从，不偏向。在我们今天，如果不是自居于人民和党的领导的对立的方面，为什么不提倡全心全意为人民服务，作党的驯服的工具，反而强调什么“刚直不阿”呢？什么叫做“乡愿”？在旧社会里，“乡愿”就是指那种善于同周围的人们和环境妥协的人。在我们今天提倡反对什么“乡愿”，并从而把老老实实工作、听党的话、并同周围的群众关系很好的人污蔑为“乡愿”，岂不是提倡人们用反抗旧社会的态度来对待新社会吗？
    第二，它们都描写了人民生活困苦，逃亡他乡，而且它们都歌颂了那种自己并不是人民、却“为民请命”或者“为民作主”的人物。谢瑶环口口声声不忘“黎民疾苦”不用说了。在《李慧娘》里面，不但那些太学生最关心“民愁国忧”，就是那个被贾似道杀死的李慧娘，做鬼也“忧的灾黎苦，愁的人间流离怨”。至于海瑞，那更被描写为人民对他“感恩戴德”、向他“叩头”的“大救星”了。这三个剧本都写于三年困难时期，它们都着重渲染人民生活困难，强烈歌颂敢于“为民请命”或者“为民作主”的人物，难道这都是一种偶合，而不是反映了它们的作者对当时的形势的看法，而且他们自己以这种人物自居吗？
    第三，它们都描写人民生活穷苦的一个根本原因是失去了土地，并从而宣传只要农民有了土地就再没有贫困的思想。谢瑶环要豪门贵族“退田”；《李慧娘》里的太学生也责骂贾似道“公田枉自害苍生”；《海瑞罢官》更突出地描写海瑞要大官僚地主“退田”。这种描写和歌颂的错误是双重的。封建社会、封建统治阶级根本不可能解决农民的土地问题。即使彻底的资产阶级革命，比如法国大革命，曾经一度在大部分地区实行过按人口分配土地，但仍然不可避免地要向两极分化。无产阶级领导的我国的新民主主义革命，最彻底地实行了土地改革，但如果不是紧接着就进行农业的社会主义改造，把个体农民组织起来，走合作化的道路，走社会主义的道路，农民也是不可避免地要向两极分化的。所以，以为“耕者有其田”以后农民就不“愁衣食”，就有了“好光景”，这不过是资产阶级民主派的幻想罢了。到了我国农业的社会主义改造已经完成、农民的土地私有制已经成为人民公社的集体所有制的时代，却来宣传这种资产阶级民主主义性质的主张，这还不是反社会主义的吗？
    以这三个戏作为反面教员，我们创作历史剧和改编传统剧首先必须认真考虑我们选择的题材和主题思想是否有利于工农兵，有利于社会主义，是否符合而不违背六条政治标准。创作历史剧和改编传统剧，不应该也不可能只是客观地描写历史人物和历史事件，只是起一些认识过去的社会的作用，必须从其中感到和发现有可以教育今天的观众和读者的思想内容，有真正对社会主义革命和社会主义建设有利的思想内容。我们的历史很悠久，我们的传统剧也很多，按照这样的要求，仍然是英雄有用武之地的，并不象有的人所说的那样，如果我们要求作者的主观意图和作品的客观效果都对人民真正有益无害，历史剧就无法写了。这种非难不过是为毒草辩护的一种借口罢了。事实已经反驳了这种为毒草辩护的非难：象《将相和》、《胆剑篇》、《三打祝家庄》、《孙悟空三打白骨精》等许多历史剧和传统剧的改编，都并没有把封建统治阶级人物美化为人民利益的代表者和保护者，更没有利用过去的人物和故事来攻击今天的社会主义社会。
