    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 18th. Pathet Lao Radio broadcast on the 17th that Phoumi Vongvichit, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, Minister of Information, Propaganda, and Tourism of the Lao Tripartite National Union Government, and member of the Central Committee of the Lao Supervisory Committee for the Implementation of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laotian Question, condemned US imperialism and its lackeys for launching a large-scale offensive against the Phou Kouth area of the liberated zone of Xieng Khouang Province in an urgent telegram sent on the 10th to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on the Laotian Question. He also warned that if US imperialism and its lackeys do not cease their offensive against the aforementioned area, the Lao patriotic armed forces will take corresponding counterattack actions.
    The telegram stated that since February 4, US imperialists and their Lao lackeys have amassed seven battalions of General Kong Le's troops and some Thai infantry and artillery units in the Muang Soui area, and with the support of US aircraft, launched a fierce offensive against the armed forces of the Lao Patriotic Front and patriotic neutralist forces in the Phou Kouth area of the liberated zone of Xieng Khouang Province, attempting to forcibly occupy Phou Kouth, the Plain of Jars, and Ban Ban. Currently, Kong Le's and Thailand's air force and artillery units are unscrupulously bombing and shelling the villages around Phou Kouth, causing a large number of casualties and severe material losses to the local residents.
    The telegram pointed out that this large-scale offensive launched by US imperialism and its lackeys is part of the US conspiracy to introduce its troops into Laos to directly occupy central and lower Laos. This action to expand the war has further aggravated the situation they are trying to worsen.
    The telegram requested the two chairmen to condemn the above-mentioned criminal actions of US imperialism and its lackeys, and to take measures to force them to stop their offensive against the Phou Kouth area and immediately withdraw their troops from the aforementioned area.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 14th. According to "Voice of Laos" radio broadcast: Khamsouk Keola, Minister of Health and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lao Tripartite National Union Government, and Colonel Deuane, Commander-in-Chief of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces, recently issued statements strongly protesting the crimes of US imperialism and its lackeys in frantically attacking Phou Kouth Mountain.
    Khamsouk Keola pointed out: "Just as the Lao Patriotic Front and the patriotic neutralist forces are trying to seek a peaceful solution to the Laotian question, US imperialism, the right-wing reactionary group, and Prince Souvanna Phouma collude with each other to expand the war. This act violates the aspirations of the Lao nation, extremely brutally tramples on the Geneva Agreement and the various agreements signed by the three parties, and exposes their ulterior motives of carrying out political deception and expanding the war."
    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 17th. According to Pathet Lao Radio broadcast on the 17th: In the battles to counterattack the enemy's offensive in the Phou Kouth Mountain and Phou Song areas from February 4 to February 12, the Lao People's Liberation Army and patriotic armed forces shot down five US aircraft, killed more than 200 enemies, wounded dozens, and captured three.
    On February 10, in a battle with the third battalion of Kong Le in Na Hai mountain township, the patriotic armed forces killed 45 enemies, wounded 35, and captured three in just five minutes, and seized a large number of weapons and military supplies.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 18th. "Voice of Laos" radio recently published a commentary pointing out: US Vice President Humphrey's activities in Vientiane are aimed at stepping up the conspiracy to send US troops into Laos and further expand the war of aggression against Laos.
    The commentary said that the Honolulu Conference held by the Washington ruling group and the South Vietnamese puppet group, "its real purpose is to attempt to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to the entire Indochina. US Vice President Humphrey hurriedly left Honolulu and ran to this country and that country, and his main purpose was also to try to sell this despicable merchandise."
    The commentary condemned US imperialism for currently gathering puppet troops to frantically invade Phou Kouth Mountain in Xieng Khouang Province and attempting to occupy central and lower Laos, pursuing its conspiracy to continue to expand the Indochina war. The commentary said that the Lao people resolutely oppose this series of conspiracies by US imperialism. The Lao people are determined to fight US imperialism resolutely until final victory is achieved.

    冯维希谴责美帝策动贡勒部队和泰军发动进攻
    老挝爱国军队在富科特山反击敌人
    坎苏·高拉等抗议美帝及其走狗进攻富科特山
    新华社康开十八日电　巴特寮电台十七日广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会总书记、老挝三方民族团结政府新闻、宣传和游览大臣、老挝监察执行一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议中央委员会委员富米·冯维希在十日打给关于老挝问题的日内瓦会议两主席的紧急电报中，谴责美帝国主义及其走狗对川圹省解放区富科特地区发动大规模进攻，并且警告说，如果美帝国主义及其走狗不停止对上述地区进攻，老挝爱国武装力量将采取相应的反击行动。
    电报说，自从二月四日以来，美帝国主义者及其老挝走狗在芒绥地方结集了贡勒将军的七个营的军队和一些泰国步兵、炮兵部队，在美国飞机的支持下，向川圹省解放区富科特地区的老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量的武装部队发动了猛烈的进攻，企图以武力占领富科特、查尔平原和班本。目前贡勒和泰国的空军和炮兵部队正在肆无忌惮地轰炸和轰击富科特周围的村庄，使当地居民遭到大量的伤亡和严重的物质损失。
    电报指出，美帝国主义及其走狗发动的这次大规模进攻，是美国阴谋把它的军队引进老挝来直接侵占中寮和下寮地区的计划的一部分。这种扩大战争的行动，更加加剧了被他们竭力恶化了的局势。
    电报要求两主席谴责美帝国主义及其走狗的上述罪恶行动，并且采取措施，迫使它们停止对富科特地区的进攻，立即从上述地区撤走他们的军队。
    据新华社康开十四日电　据“老挝之声”电台广播：老挝三方民族团结政府卫生部大臣兼代理外交大臣坎苏·高拉和老挝爱国中立力量总指挥敦上校最近分别发表声明，强烈抗议美帝国主义和它的走狗疯狂地进攻富科特山的罪行。
    坎苏·高拉指出：“正当老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量设法寻求和平解决老挝问题的时候，美帝国主义、右派反动集团和富马亲王互相勾结来扩大战争。这种行径违反了老挝民族的愿望，极其粗暴地践踏了日内瓦协议和三方所签订的各项协议，并且暴露了它们进行政治欺骗和扩大战争的不可告人的阴谋。”
    新华社康开十七日电　据巴特寮电台十七日广播：老挝人民解放军和爱国武装力量在富科特山和富松地区从二月四日到十二日反击敌人进攻的战斗中，击落美国飞机五架，打死敌人二百多名，打伤数十名，俘虏三名。
    二月十日，爱国武装力量在纳黑山乡同贡勒第三营的一次战斗中，仅用五分钟，就打死敌人四十五名，打伤三十五名，俘虏三名，并缴获了大批武器和军用物资。
    新华社康开十八日电　“老挝之声”电台最近发表评论指出：美国副总统汉弗莱到万象活动是为了加紧策划把美国军队派进老挝和进一步扩大侵略老挝战争的阴谋。
    评论说，华盛顿统治集团同南越傀儡集团举行的檀香山会议，“其真正目的，是妄图把侵略越南的战争扩大到整个印度支那。美国副总统汉弗莱匆匆忙忙离开檀香山，奔这国跑那国，他的主要目的也是企图推销这个卑鄙的货色。”
    评论谴责美帝国主义目前正纠集傀儡军队猖狂进犯川圹省富科特山和企图占领中、下寮，推行它继续扩大印度支那战争的阴谋。评论说，老挝人民坚决反对美帝国主义这一系列的阴谋活动。老挝人民已下定了决心，坚决同美帝国主义进行战斗，直到取得最后的胜利。
