    Xinhua News Agency, Quito, 11th dispatch: The Ecuadorian people's anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggle, which has persisted for more than two weeks, is continuing to expand and has now spread to seven provinces.
    On the 9th, student masses in Guayaquil held another demonstration to protest the crimes of oppression and persecution of the people by the U.S. imperialist-backed dictatorial regime. Demonstrators engaged in heroic struggles with the police who came to suppress them. Due to the continued development of the demonstrations, the authorities have dispatched many more military police to the city. The atmosphere in Guayaquil is tense, and police cavalry constantly patrol the streets.
    On the same day, the Ecuadorian University Student Federation held a representative meeting in Guayaquil. Student representatives at the meeting demanded that the military dictatorial regime immediately abolish the reactionary higher education law and restore student autonomy.
    They also demanded that the government authorities release all political prisoners and allow all exiled patriotic individuals to return home.
    Enrique Gallegos, President of the Ecuadorian University Student Federation, in a statement on the 10th, again resolutely demanded an end to military dictatorial rule and the establishment of a democratic and patriotic government.
    Citizens of Guaranda, the capital of Bolivar Province in central Ecuador, also held demonstrations on the 9th, despite military police suppression, demanding the immediate resignation of the military government.
    The Ecuadorian people's current anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggle began in Quito on the 27th of last month. On the 4th, it spread to Guayaquil, the largest city in the country. On the 7th, it spread to the capitals of four other provinces. On the 9th, citizens of Guaranda, the capital of Bolivar Province, also joined the struggle.
