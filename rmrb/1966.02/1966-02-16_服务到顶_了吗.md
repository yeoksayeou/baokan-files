    Has “Service to the Utmost” Been Achieved?
    In our Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market, pork has always been sold in different grades according to residents' cooking habits. A pig is roughly divided into more than ten specifications, such as leg meat, center cut, ribs, streaky pork, pig's head, pig's trotters, and pig's feet. Some cadres and salespeople believe that this is doing business actively and providing service to the utmost.
    In reality, it hasn't reached the utmost. Once, an old man came to buy seven pig ears. We had always sold pig heads in halves. The salesperson was stunned by the old man's request. At the time, seeing the old man's urgent request, the salesperson reluctantly sold them to him. The remaining incomplete pig heads had to be sold in pieces. But unexpectedly, customers bought noses, some bought chins, and suddenly these pig heads were sold out. The next day, we tried this method again, and sales were just as good. We sold even more pig heads than before.
    This incident reflects that we are not serving consumers wholeheartedly. Because selling pig heads in pieces is not as convenient as selling them whole, some people are afraid of the trouble.
    The incident of selling pig heads in pieces also educated the salespeople in other departments of the vegetable market. They also broke old rules and, where possible and reasonable, tried to sell in smaller portions and pieces to provide convenience to customers.

### “服务到顶”了吗

    “服务到顶”了吗
    我们三角地菜场，猪肉向来是按居民烹调习惯分档出售的。一头猪大致分腿肉、夹心、排骨、肋条、猪头、蹄膀、脚爪等十多个规格。有些干部和营业员认为，这算是生意做活，服务到顶了。
    实际并没有到顶。有一次，一位老大爷来买七只猪耳朵。我们供应的猪头，一直是半只起售的。老大爷提出这样的要求，可把营业员给愣住了。当时，看到老人家要求迫切，营业员勉强卖给他。剩下几只不完整的猪头，也只得斩零出售。可是出乎意料，顾客有的买鼻子，有的买下颏，一下这几只猪头就卖光了。次日，按照这个办法再试试，销路同样很好。猪头比过去卖的还多了。
    这件事情反映出，我们还不是全心全意为消费者服务。因为猪头斩开零售，总不如整只卖方便，有的人就怕麻烦。
    猪头开刀零售这件事，也教育了菜场其他部门的营业员。他们也打破老规矩，在可能和合理的情况下，尽量拆零切块出售，给顾客方便。
