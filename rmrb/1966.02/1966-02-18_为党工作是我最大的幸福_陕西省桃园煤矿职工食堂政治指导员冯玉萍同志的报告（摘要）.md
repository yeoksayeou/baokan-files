    Working for the Party is My Greatest Happiness
    Report by Comrade Feng Yuping, Political Instructor of the Staff Canteen of Taoyuan Coal Mine, Shaanxi Province (Summary)
    (Xinhua News Agency, 17th) Feng Yuping, a representative of advanced figures from the national industrial and transportation front, an outstanding Communist Party member, a good daughter of the working class, and the political instructor of the staff canteen of Taoyuan Coal Mine under the Weinan Coal Industry Company of Shaanxi Province, delivered a report at the National Industrial and Transportation Work Conference and the enlarged session of the National Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference on the 17th, entitled "Working for the Party is My Greatest Happiness." Here is a summary:
    Editor's Note: What is selfless spirit? Comrade Feng Yuping's speech answers this question from many aspects.
    A conscious and strong revolutionary should be able to withstand two tests. One is in extraordinary circumstances, facing danger without fear, stepping forward bravely, with only the interests of the revolution in mind, and not caring about personal safety at all. The other is in ordinary circumstances, wholeheartedly, burying oneself in hard work, with only the interests of the revolution in mind, and not calculating personal gains or losses at all. Being selfless in extraordinary circumstances is certainly not easy; being selfless in ordinary circumstances is equally not easy.
    Comrade Feng Yuping has proven with her own practice that she can withstand these two tests and deserves to be called a selfless proletarian revolutionary fighter.
    In the extraordinary circumstances of wind pipe explosions and machine fires, Comrade Feng Yuping thought about protecting state property and the lives of her class brothers, disregarding her own safety, and rushing to shut down the machines. This is the selfless spirit.
    In the situation of being treated for burns in the hospital and being bedridden, Comrade Feng Yuping thought about how to reduce the burden on medical staff and how to do more work for the Party and the people in the future, enduring severe pain, overcoming all difficulties, and developing her ability to live and work; and after returning to work, she did her best to do more work. This is also the selfless spirit.
    "Working for the Party is my greatest happiness." This communist worldview gives Comrade Feng Yuping dauntless courage and the strongest perseverance, enabling her to demonstrate a selfless spirit in any situation.
    Comrade Mao Zedong called on us to learn and carry forward the communist spirit of being utterly devoted to others without any thought of self. In her ordinary and great work, Comrade Feng Yuping has set a good example for us.
    Today, I am reporting to the Party and the leading comrades about my experience in rescuing equipment from a fire and how our great Party rescued me from the brink of death after I was injured, and how it pointed out the direction for me to overcome difficulties.
    My hometown is Gongxian County in Henan Province. After coming to the Tongchuan mining area with my husband in 1956, I became a sanitation worker in the former Tongchuan Mining Bureau's nursery. In 1958, the leadership assigned me to learn how to operate air compressors. In January 1959, I came to Taoyuan Coal Mine. In October 1959, I gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. In the years I worked in the mine, I was repeatedly named a red banner bearer and an advanced producer of the mine. These achievements are the result of the teachings of our great Party and our beloved Chairman Mao, and are inseparable from the help of my comrades.
    As soon as I saw the fire, I got anxious. At that time, the most prominent thought was: protect the machine, quickly stop it.
    In January 1962, I attended the Tongchuan Mining Bureau's Advanced Producer Representative Conference. On the evening of the day I returned to Taoyuan Coal Mine, I went to the mine early to take over the shift. This shift was the last shift before the 1962 Spring Festival. After I arrived at the air compressor room underground, I saw three masters repairing the wind pipe. After talking with them, I learned that there had been an accident with the wind pipe that morning. After taking over the shift, I first started No. 3 machine, and then No. 5 machine. Just as I started the machine, Zhao, the leader of the tunneling team, came to ask for air, saying that the air pressure was not enough. After I told him the situation, I went to check No. 3 machine. Just after finishing the inspection, while bending over and not yet standing up straight, I heard a loud bang. The newly repaired wind pipe interface suddenly came loose, and a strong wind blew the fire towards me. As soon as I saw the fire, I got anxious. At that time, the most prominent thought was: protect the machine, quickly stop it. The switch for the machine was near me. I didn't bother to straighten my legs, and turned around to feel for the switch. However, I don't know how I was knocked over. The second time, I hurriedly turned over again and continued to feel for the switch. I saw a blaze of fire, and smoke billowing. The switch pull line was blown straight up by the wind. It was hard to reach, and I managed to grab it and shut down No. 3 machine. At this time, my face and hands had been severely burned. However, the whirring sound of No. 5 machine still rang in my ears. A most terrible thought rushed to my mind: if the fire blew to the working face, it would cause a gas explosion, and the lives of the comrades working underground would not be guaranteed. At this time, I thought: I am a Communist Party member, I should do everything possible to stop the machine immediately. I endured the pain and crawled towards No. 5 machine, but the more anxious I was, the less I could crawl to it. At that time, I only hated that I was too weak. Later, I don't know how I fainted and lost consciousness, and did not complete the task. After I woke up in the Mining Bureau Hospital, I heard the Party branch secretary say that the workers on the working face had all safely evacuated, and the machines and mines were not damaged. Only then did I feel relieved.
    I looked forward to being discharged from the hospital early and going back to work, and even dreamed that I was in the engine room.
    After this injury, I was treated in three hospitals, which lasted two years and eight months. At first, I stayed in the Tongchuan Mining Bureau Hospital, and after a few days, I was transferred to the Xi'an Central Hospital. Lying in the hospital bed, I felt very anxious when I thought that the mine was very busy and that I still had many things to do. I kept asking the doctor when I could be discharged.
    At first, I only knew that my face was injured. I didn't know how badly it was injured. I thought that I would be discharged from the hospital in ten days or half a month at most. I looked forward to one day after another, and several months passed in a flash, and I became even more anxious. I wanted to find a mirror to see how badly I was injured, but no one would give it to me. Finally, I managed to get one. When I looked in the mirror, I was really shocked. How could I become like this! My face didn't look like a human face at all. I felt very uncomfortable. At this time, the doctor also notified me that my fingers could not be saved and had to be amputated. When I heard this, I couldn't say a word for a long time. I thought, it doesn't matter if my face is injured, it's just a matter of skin. The main thing is to have a pair of working hands. I looked forward to being discharged from the hospital early and going back to work, and even dreamed that I was in the engine room. Now that I have lost my hands, what else can I do? If I can't work, what's the point of living as a burden to the Party and the people! During this period, I thought a lot. I thought of the heroine Liu Hulan, I thought of Paul Kochakin, and I thought of how a party member should treat life and death. I felt that if I had died while rescuing the machine, it would have been worthwhile. Now, the Party and the comrades have rescued me, spent a lot of effort to treat me, and it is so wrong for me to think about death casually!
    I should live on strongly. I decided to exercise my ability to live.
    I should live on strongly. If I want to live, I must first be able to live independently and not let others serve me for the rest of my life. I decided to exercise my ability to live. At that time, I was lying in bed all day, and even eating had to be fed by others, so I started practicing from eating.
    I didn't have any fingers, and the burns on my palms were not completely healed. At that time, both hands were wrapped in gauze. I thought, the nurses are so busy, and they have to feed me three meals a day, I really feel sorry for them. They didn't let me do it, so I looked for opportunities to practice secretly. One day, the nurse had just brought the meal to me, and she inserted the spoon into the bowl. Coincidentally, a patient called her. I said, "You feed him first, and I'll eat after he eats." After the nurse left, I slowly moved my body to the bedside table, wanting to hold the spoon with both hands to eat. It was easy to think, but my hands didn't listen to me. I hugged it and hugged it, but I couldn't lift the spoon. At that time, I was both angry and anxious. I was angry that I was so useless, and I was anxious to eat the food before the nurse came back. In this way, I used too much force at once, and inserted the spoon from the gauze seam into the flesh of my palm, and the pain made me shiver all over! After the pain, I looked and saw that it was okay. The spoon was still in the gauze seam and hadn't fallen off. I was very happy in my heart. I originally wanted to hold the spoon with both hands to eat, but now I can just insert the spoon with one hand and eat! However, I stretched out my hand and scooped it up, but I couldn't scoop up the food. Finally, I managed to scoop up half a spoonful, but the arm injury was just healed, and I couldn't bend it. The spoon couldn't reach my mouth. The food was right next to my mouth, but I couldn't eat it! In anger and anxiety, my hand trembled, and the spoon fell to the ground with a clang. The nurse heard the noise and hurried over and patiently fed me the food. But I made up my mind to continue practicing.
    I moved my joints every day in bed, time after time. After more than two weeks, my hands could finally slowly bend over and touch the top of my head. The nurse brought the meal again that day. When she went to deliver meals to other patients, I took the second initiative to eat. Based on my previous experience, this time I didn't rush or get angry, I stabilized my strength, aimed at the spoon, and slowly inserted it along the bandage seam. After inserting it, I gently lifted my hand, and the spoon was lifted up, not painful at all, and then gently put it down, slowly pushed it into the rice, scooped up a little rice, and tremblingly finally sent the rice to my mouth. I could eat by myself, and I was so happy that I almost cried!
    We must achieve independent living in order to further strive to work for the Party.
    After solving the problem of eating, I felt that it was not enough to just be able to eat. I couldn't move, and even going to the toilet had to be served by others. We must achieve independent living in order to further strive to work for the Party. I asked the nurse to help me get out of bed. Once, the nurse agreed to my request and helped me out of bed, but my legs trembled straight, and I couldn't stand up. The wound where the skin was taken was also as painful as being stabbed by a chaotic needle. After getting out of bed that time, after two weeks, I asked to get out of bed again. The doctors and nurses didn't agree, so I looked for opportunities to practice on my own. Every day at noon, when the nurses went out to eat, it was a good opportunity to practice. One day, as soon as the nurse went out, I started to move. I hugged the quilt with both arms, turned over and crawled on the bed, and slowly slid my legs down. After the first foot landed on the ground, the wound on my leg started to hurt. I thought, it's going to hurt anyway, so I focused on getting the second foot down. Before the second foot went down, the first foot trembled so much that it couldn't hold on. With a force, I rolled to the ground with the person and the quilt. When the nurse came back and saw me like this, she thought that I hadn't lain well on the bed and had rolled down. Every time she left the ward, she would kindly say to me: "Lie inside, don't fall down again!" At that time, I checked the reason for my first failure. One was because my physical strength was not good, and the other was because the method of getting out of bed was not correct. I shouldn't have hugged the quilt. What's the point of hugging the quilt! If you fall, it will also fall down with you.
    The next day, I made another attempt to get out of bed. This time, I first pushed away the mattress, inserted both arms into the grid of the wire bed, and relied on the strength of the bed to get to the ground smoothly. The legs were still half straight and half bent. After standing for a while, I moved one step with difficulty, and didn't dare to move anymore. I had to save some strength to get back on the bed. After climbing onto the bed, I was exhausted and sweating all over, but I was very happy in my heart. I continued to practice like this. In less than two weeks, I could walk to the outside of the ward. That day, I was just sitting on a stool against the wall to rest when the nurse came back and asked in surprise: "Huh, how did you get here?" I said, "I came here by myself." She said, "Oh, that's amazing!" She was happy, and I was happy too.
    My heart is still beating, my brain is still good, my eyes are good, and my legs can still walk. Aren't these conditions for working for the people?
    After getting out of bed, I often wandered outside the ward and borrowed some picture books to read. Once, I saw Chairman Mao's works in single volumes, "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," at a patient's place, so I borrowed them to study. I remembered that I had also studied these two articles soon after joining the Party, but at that time, I didn't understand the meaning of serving the people very well. I thought, I am neither a receptionist nor a waiter. I only deal with iron lumps like machines all day long. How can this be called serving the people? Now when I picked up "Serve the People," I thought of opening the machine before. Only when the machine is opened can coal be produced. This coal is the "food" of industry. Heating, cooking, and driving trains all require it. Isn't opening the machine called serving the people? What is it if not serving the people! Thinking of this, I felt very happy. But then I thought that my hands were crippled, I couldn't open the machine, and even my own life had to be served by others. Could I still serve the people? I held the book and thought and looked. Seeing Chairman Mao said: "Our comrades must see the achievements, see the light, and increase our courage in times of difficulty." I am currently in difficulty. This difficulty is that my hands and face are burned. At this time, I still have to see the achievements, see the light, and muster courage. I thought, my heart is still beating, my brain is still good, my eyes are good, and my legs can still walk. Aren't these conditions for working for the people? Chairman Mao's words are really a magic weapon, more effective than any medicine! My mood suddenly rose. I thought, although I can't open the machine, I can still do other work! I thought carefully about the various jobs in the mine, what exactly could I do? Everything is inseparable from hands. I thought of the simplest job: guarding the gate. Yes, sit at the gate with a stool and protect the safety of the coal mine. After having this idea, I felt that I had something to look forward to, and my courage to exercise was even greater.
    After that, my body got better day by day, and stronger day by day. I could basically take care of my own life slowly. I could also put on clothes, but I still couldn't button them, and it was even harder to tie the straps. The hospital gowns were all tied with straps, and I had to ask others for help every time I went to the toilet. Everyone has their own work, so how can I use these things to trouble others? I thought, I must learn it myself. I first tied the head of the strap into a loop, bit it with my mouth, and then held the other end of the strap with both hands and put it into the loop, slowly aligning it, reaching in, hooking it, and then tightening it, so that it was tied into a knot. It took a very long time to tie a loop. Sometimes it was not tied well and it became a dead knot. But slowly, as time went on, I became familiar with it. Now, I can tie my clothes and shoelaces myself.
    Each time a difficulty is overcome, one less difficulty exists, and a little more can be done.
    Every time I overcame a difficulty and solved a problem, I felt particularly happy. Because each time a difficulty is overcome, one less difficulty exists, and a little more can be done, and the ideal of returning to work is a little closer. At this time, I became more confident in the desire to guard the gate for the mine. I can walk, I have faith, and I have a note, so I can go forward to pick it up. But what if someone sends a letter and asks me to sign it? I still don't know how! So, I started practicing writing with a pen again. At first, I thought it would be easy to hold a pen. I can hold a spoon. The difference between a pen and a spoon is just that one is flat and the other is round. Can't I also hold it and write? But after holding the pen, my two fists covered the tip of the pen tightly. I tilted my head and looked here and looked there, but I still couldn't see the tip of the pen. What should I do? If I can't see it, I'll just write it as it is! At first, the words couldn't be written in the grid. Either they were written into a lump, or they were not installed before and after. I couldn't write a round word. Sometimes the more I practiced, the more flustered I became, and I really wanted to drop the pen. However, when I thought of my ideal of returning to work and serving the people, my energy came again, and I picked up the pen and practiced stroke by stroke. After more than a month, I finally wrote something like a word, and I could arrange it in a line. I was unspeakably happy in my heart. The first time, I wrote a letter to the branch secretary of the electromechanical workshop of our mine. The comrades were very happy after receiving the letter, and wrote back to encourage me. I was happily calculating that when I returned to the mine to guard the gate, it would be no problem to sign for documents! I can take on this job, I can work!
    At this time, I was no longer satisfied, and I had newer desires. I thought that the work of guarding the gate was too light. If I exercised more, I could do more work for the people. Would it be okay to go to the receiving and dispatch room? Would it be okay to watch the warehouse or the women's bathhouse? When I thought like this, my energy became even greater, and I felt that my life was becoming more and more interesting and happier. This is my second life. This life was given to me by Chairman Mao and the Party, and I should dedicate it completely to the Party and the people. I decided to work even harder to exercise.
    In October 1962, my burns had basically healed, and I was transferred to the plastic surgery department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical College to repair my face. I still used all the spare time to seize the exercise and strive to be discharged from the hospital and work as soon as possible.
    A person's ability is large or small, but serving the people has no definite scope. Doing anything is serving the people.
    The main purpose of starting exercise was to restore my ability to live. Later, after studying "Serve the People," I thought to myself: Now that I have solved some of my own life problems and reduced the task of nurses, can I help others do some things and exercise my ability to serve the people? I think it's perfectly possible. A person's ability is large or small, but serving the people has no definite scope. Doing anything is serving the people. Taking the immediate work as an example, sweeping the ward, helping the staff, aren't these all serving the people! At first, I was a little embarrassed. When I stretched out my hand, I thought, forget it! I'll talk about it later when I go back! After studying "On Practice," I saw Chairman Mao said: "If we have the correct theory, but only talk about it for a while, put it on the shelf, and do not practice it, then even if this theory is good, it is meaningless." I thought to myself: I have studied "Serve the People," and I also know what's going on, but I haven't taken action. Isn't this just empty talk? So, I took action and paid attention to comparing myself with it every time I studied. In the ward, children over six years old were not accompanied by adults, and all relied on nurses to take care of them. I tried my best to help, such as getting wash water and buying meals. The elderly couldn't get out of bed after surgery, so I helped them. I also practiced cleaning the ward. At first, I took a broom to sweep the floor. I thought, this broom handle is ten times bigger than the pen, so it's easy to master. I can sweep it as soon as I hug it. However, when I hugged it, I realized that if I hugged it too tightly, my hands would be sore from grinding. If I hugged it loosely, it would fall off after a few sweeps. It took a lot of effort to sweep the floor once. If you can sweep the floor, you still have to let others mop it. It's useless. You still haven't saved people's strength. In this way, in the last year of the hospital, I was focused on work, and my thoughts were very pleasant.
    Chairman Mao pointed out the direction for me and gave me a second life, so that I could return to work. I can't leave Chairman Mao's works for a day.
    In the hospital, I not only treated my injuries and exercised my ability to live, but the greater gain was that I began to seriously study Chairman Mao's works and improve my political awareness. Chairman Mao pointed out the direction for me and gave me a second life, so that I could return to work. I can't leave Chairman Mao's works for a day. Because of my low cultural level, there are many unfamiliar words in studying Chairman's works, and I can't explain some words and sentences. I often put the unfamiliar words there and ask the staff or patients to help me recognize them. Later, the comrades in the hospital bought me a dictionary for me, and I learned and checked while studying, and my cultural level has also improved. In the hospital, I wrote more than 30,000 words of diaries and learning experiences, but I haven't finished writing what I want to say in my heart.
    On November 7, 1964, the leaders assigned me to work in the staff canteen. My long-awaited wish to work has been realized, how excited I was! At first, I worked in the nutrition stove. This stove mainly serves patients. The comrades in the canteen were worried about my hands and didn't let me work. I always tried my best to grab it. When I saw that the tables and doors and windows were dirty, I would wipe them. When the vegetables and coal were brought back, the cooks were busy, so I would help to carry the vegetables and coal. Because it was cold, the new skin growing on my hands was relatively tender, and some places were cracked with blood. When the comrades saw it, they said: "Don't do it, okay?" But I felt that I couldn't do fine work and clever work, but I should do some stupid work and heavy work, freeing up time for the cooks to do more fine work and clever work and serve everyone well. The cooks are relatively busy and very tired from work. When I saw that their work clothes were dirty, I would help wash them; when others were pressing noodles, I would help stir the noodle press; when wrapping dumplings, I couldn't wrap them, so I would roll the dumpling wrappers. The administrator is also very busy, so I help him count meal tickets and calculate accounts. Coal miner Xie Mingwang, who lived next to me, was injured underground. For a period of time after that, he couldn't get out of bed, so I would deliver and fetch the bedpan for him and bring the meals to his bed. Sometimes the meals didn't suit his taste, so I would cook something else for him at home. In the first half of this year, some young comrades in our canteen thought that being a cook was not promising and were not at ease at work. I used my work and rest time to talk to them, read Chairman Mao's works to them, and tell them revolutionary stories, so that these comrades settled down and became active in their work.
    The comrades in our canteen organized a Chairman Mao's Works Study Group, and repeatedly studied articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Combat Liberalism." Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the comrades further recognized the importance of doing cooking work, and clarified that being a cook is doing revolution and serving the people. Therefore, their service attitude has been corrected, their handling of affairs is fair, and their revolutionary enthusiasm has become greater and greater. The quality of food has improved, and the variety of food has also increased from two or three dishes per meal in the past to more than a dozen now. In the past, when the water pipes had problems, the mine's administrative section had to send more than a dozen odd workers to carry water for the canteen every time. Now, when the water pipes have problems, the cooks not only ensure that the meals are cooked well, but also carry water themselves, ensuring the needs of the canteen and saving expenses for the country.
    I must firmly remember the care and teachings of the Party for me, and work hard for the Party for the rest of my life.
    Facts have repeatedly proved that Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse illuminating all our work and the guide for all our work and actions. After returning to work in November 1964, I still insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works and wrote tens of thousands of words of experience and notes. However, I have not learned very well, and I have not understood Chairman Mao's thoughts very well. Therefore, I must study Chairman Mao's works even harder and more diligently in the future, and I must constantly arm my mind with Mao Zedong Thought.
    Because I have lost ten fingers, many comrades constantly ask with concern what difficulties I have in daily life activities. Now I would also like to report to the Party, the leaders, and the comrades. I can now take care of myself completely. Except for sewing clothes, I can do everything, including combing my hair, washing my hair, and washing clothes. I can even sew on buttons myself. I also have a family, a spouse, and two children. My spouse also works in Taoyuan Coal Mine. If he has an early shift, I will get up in the morning to cook for the two children who are going to school. What do I cook? Now I can do everything except wrapping dumplings. The coarse meals I make are not as good as those made by other sisters, and they are not as meticulous. When I chop vegetables, I hold the knife and chop a little thicker. I can barely roll noodles, and I can also steam buns and pancakes. In July 1965, the Party took me to Beijing again to install cosmetic prosthetic hands, which made me feel unspeakably excited. It was the dear Party that saved me from the brink of death, it was the dear Party that let me return to work, and now, the dear Party has given me prosthetic hands. I deeply feel that it is not a pair of prosthetic hands, it is the deep affection of the dear Party and the beloved Chairman Mao for his daughter. I must firmly remember the care and teachings of the Party for me, and work hard for the Party for the rest of my life.

    为党工作是我最大的幸福
    陕西省桃园煤矿职工食堂政治指导员冯玉萍同志的报告（摘要）
    新华社十七日讯　全国工业交通战线先进人物代表、优秀的共产党员、工人阶级的好女儿、陕西省渭北煤炭工业公司桃园煤矿职工食堂政治指导员冯玉萍，十七日在全国工业交通工作会议、全国工业交通政治工作会议扩大会议上作了报告，题目是《为党工作是我最大的幸福》。摘要如下：
    编者按：什么是忘我精神，冯玉萍同志的这篇讲话，从很多方面回答了这个问题。
    一个自觉的坚强的革命者，应当经得起两种考验。一种是在非常情况下，临危不惧，挺身而出，心中只有革命利益，根本不顾个人安危。一种是在日常情况下，全心全意，埋头苦干，心中同样只有革命利益，完全不计个人得失。在非常情况下能够忘我，当然不容易；在日常情况下能够忘我，同样不容易。
    冯玉萍同志以自己的实践证明了经得起这两种考验，不愧是一个忘我的无产阶级革命战士。
    在风管爆炸、机器着火的非常情况下，冯玉萍同志想的是保护国家财产，保护阶级兄弟的生命安全，奋不顾身，抢险关车。这就是忘我精神。
    在医院治疗烧伤、卧床不起的情况下，冯玉萍同志想的是怎样减轻医务人员的负担，将来怎样为党为人民做更多工作，忍受剧痛，排除万难，锻炼生活能力和工作能力；而在恢复工作以后，又尽力之所能，做更多的工作。这同样是忘我精神。
    “为党工作是我最大的幸福。”这种共产主义世界观，给予冯玉萍同志大无畏的勇气、最刚强的毅力，使她在任何情况下，都能表现出忘我精神。
    毛泽东同志号召我们学习和发扬毫不利己专门利人的共产主义精神。冯玉萍同志在自己平凡而伟大的工作中，为我们树立了一个好榜样。
    今天向党、向领导同志们汇报一下我抢救设备失火的情况和受伤后我们伟大的党是怎样把我从九死一生中抢救出来的，是怎样给我指明方向战胜困难的。
    我老家在河南巩县，一九五六年随爱人来到铜川矿区以后，就当了原铜川矿务局托儿所的卫生工。一九五八年，领导分配我学开压风机，一九五九年一月来到桃园煤矿。一九五九年十月，我光荣地加入了中国共产党。在矿上工作的几年，我曾先后多次被评为矿上的红旗手和先进生产者。这些成绩，都是我们伟大的党和敬爱的毛主席教导的结果，是与同志们的帮助分不开的。
    一见起火，我着了急，当时，最突出的一个念头是：保护机器，急速停车。
    一九六二年一月，我出席了铜川矿务局先进生产者代表会。回到桃园煤矿的当天晚上，我就提前下井去接班。这一班，是一九六二年春节前的最后一班。我到井下压风机房后，只见三位师傅，正在修理风管，经过交谈，才知道这天早晨风管曾发生过事故。接班后，我先开了三号车，接着又开了五号车。刚刚开了车，掘进队赵班长就来要风，说风压不够。我把情况向他谈了以后，就去检查三号车。刚刚检查完毕，弯着腰还没有起身，就听到轰隆一声，刚修理的风管接口突然脱口，一股强风吹着火向我扑来。一见起火，我着了急，当时，最突出的一个念头是：保护机器，急速停车。机器的拉线开关，就在我附近，我顾不得把两腿站直，就转过身去摸开关。但是，自己不知怎样被撞翻了。第二次又急着翻过身来，继续去摸开关，只见眼前一片火光，烟气腾腾，开关拉线被风吹得直往上飘，好不容易才捞着了，把三号车关住。这时，我的脸和手已经被烧得很严重。可是，五号车转动的嗡嗡声仍在耳边响着，一个最可怕的念头冲上来：火吹到工作面，会引起瓦斯爆炸，在井下工作的同志们，生命安全就没有保障。这时我想：我是个共产党员，应当想尽一切办法，立即把车停住。我忍痛爬向五号车，可是越急越爬不到跟前，当时只恨自己力气太小。后来，也不知怎样昏了过去，失去了知觉，没有完成任务。到了矿务局医院我清醒过来后，听党支部书记说，工作面的工人同志都安全撤出，机器、矿井也没有损伤，这才放下心来。
    我成天盼望着早日出院，回去工作，甚至作梦都在机房里。
    这次受伤以后，先后经过三个医院治疗，历时两年零八个月。开始在铜川矿务局医院，住了几天就转到西安中心医院。躺在病床上，一想到矿上工作很忙，自己还有许多事情要做，心里非常焦急，老催问大夫啥时能出院。
    最初，我只知道自己面部受了伤，不知道伤的程度怎么样，认为顶多住个十天半月就能出院。盼了一天又一天，一下子过了几个月，我更着急了。我想找面镜子看看我到底伤得怎么样，可是谁也不肯给我，最后，好不容易才弄到了。当我看了镜子以后，真把自己吓了一跳，我怎么会变成这个样子！脸简直不象个人样子。我心里非常难受。正在这时，大夫又通知我说，我的手指保留不住，要截掉。我一听，半天一句话也说不出来。我想，面部受伤倒不要紧，不过是皮肤的事，主要的是要有一双劳动的手。我成天盼望着早日出院，回去工作，甚至作梦都在机房里。现在我失去了双手，还能干什么呢？不能工作，变成党和人民的累赘活着还有什么意思呢！这期间，我想得很多。我想到了英雄刘胡兰，想到了保尔·柯察金，想到了一个党员应当怎样对待生和死。我感到，如果自己是在抢救机器时死了，那是值得的。现在，党和同志们把自己救出来了，花了很大的力量给自己治疗，自己随便想到死，那是多么不对呀！
    我应该坚强地活下去。我决定锻炼自己生活的能力。
    我应该坚强地活下去。要活下去，首先要能独立生活，不能让别人服侍自己一辈子。我决定锻炼自己生活的能力。当时，自己整天躺在床上，连吃饭都要别人喂，我便先从吃饭练起。
    我没有了手指，手掌的烧伤也没有完全长好，当时两只手全用纱布包着。我想，护士同志那样忙，还要一天三顿喂我吃饭，真过意不去。他们不让我动手，我就找机会，偷偷练。有一天，护士刚刚把饭送到我面前，勺子往碗里一插，恰好有个病友叫她。我说：“你先喂他吃吧，他吃了我再吃。”护士走后，我慢慢把身子移到床头柜前，想用两只手抱起勺子吃饭。想得很容易，就是手不听使唤，抱呀抱呀，怎么也抱不起勺子来。当时，我又气又急，气的是怎么自己这样没用，急的是想赶在护士回来之前把饭吃到嘴。这样，一下用劲过猛，把勺子从纱布缝缝里插到手心的肉上去了，痛的浑身打了个颤！痛过后一看，还好，勺子还在纱布缝里没有掉下来。自己心里好高兴，原来想要两个手抱住勺子，才能吃饭，现在不是一只手插上勺子，就可以吃了吗！可是，伸手舀呀舀呀，怎么也舀不起饭来。最后，好不容易舀上了半勺，可是手臂的伤刚好，还打不了弯弯，勺子凑不上嘴。饭到嘴边就是干瞪着眼睛没法吃！自己一气，一急，手一颤动，当啷一声勺子就掉到地上了，护士听见响声，赶了来，耐心地给我喂了饭。可是我下了决心，还要继续练。　
    我天天在床上活动关节，一次又一次，经过两个多星期，两只手终于慢慢能弯过来，摸到头顶了。护士这天又把饭端来了，等她给别的病友送饭去时，我第二次动手吃饭。凭上回的经验，这次不急不气，稳住劲，对准饭勺，顺着绷带缝慢慢往里插。插进去后，把手轻轻一举，勺子带起来了，一点也不痛苦，又轻轻放下去，往饭里慢慢推，舀上一点饭，颤颤抖抖地终于把饭送到嘴里。我能自己吃饭了，简直高兴得要流泪了！
    必须做到独立生活，才能进一步争取为党工作。
    吃饭问题解决了以后，我又感到光会吃饭还不行。自己不能动，连大小便都要人家来服侍，必须做到独立生活，才能进一步争取为党工作。我要求护士搀我下床。有一次，护士答应了我的请求，扶我下床，可是两只腿直打颤，没法立起来，取过皮的伤口也象乱针扎的一样痛。那次下床以后，过了两星期，我又要求下床，大夫、护士不答应，我就找机会自己练。每天中午，护士出去吃饭时，就是练习的好机会。有一天，护士刚刚出门，我就开始动身。我用两只胳膊抱住被子，翻身爬在床上，腿慢慢往下溜，头一只脚下到地上后，腿上的伤口就痛起来了。我想，反正要痛的，一心强着要下第二只脚。第二只脚还没有下去，第一只脚就颤得不行了。一使劲，连人带被子滚到了地下。护士回来一看我这个样子，以为我是在床上没躺好，滚下来的，以后每次出病房都要关心地对我说：“往里面躺躺，别再掉下来！”当时，我检查了头一次失败的原因，一是因为自己体力不行，再是下床的方法也不对，我不该抱住被子，抱住被子顶啥！你倒了，它也跟着往下掉。
    隔了一天，我又作了一次下床试验。这次我先把褥子推开，把两只胳膊往钢丝床的格子里一插，靠着床的力量，顺利的下地了，腿还是半直半弯的。站了一会，艰难地挪了一步，就不敢再挪了，要留一点力气上床。爬上床以后，累得满身大汗，可心里很高兴。我就这样连续练下去，不到两个星期的时间，就可以走到病房门外边了。这天，我刚坐在靠墙的凳子上休息，护士回来了，惊奇的问：“咦，你怎么到这儿来了？”我说：“我自己到这儿来的。”她说：“哎哟，好了不起！”她也高兴，我也高兴。
    我的心还在跳动，脑子还很好，眼睛也好，两条腿也能走路，这不是还有为人民工作的条件吗！
    下床以后，我常常到病房外面转转，借些连环画册看看。有一次，我在一位病友那里看见了毛主席著作单行本《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》，便借来学习。记得自己在入党不久，也学习过这两篇文章，但那时对为人民服务的意义理解得很不够。我想，我一不是招待员，二不是服务员，一天只和机器这铁疙瘩打交道，咋叫为人民服务？现在拿起《为人民服务》来，就想起了以前开机器。开了机器，才能出煤。这煤，是工业的“粮食”，取暖、做饭、开火车等等都要用它。开机器这不叫为人民服务叫什么？这就是为人民服务！想到这里，我感到很高兴。可是，又一想自己两只手残废了，不能开机器了，连自己的生活都要人服侍，还能不能再为人民服务呢？我拿着书想着看着，看到毛主席说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”我现在正在困难当中，这个困难就是烧伤了我的双手，烧伤了我的面部。这时候，我仍然要看到成绩，看到光明，要鼓起勇气。我想，我的心还在跳动，脑子还很好，眼睛也好，两条腿也能走路，这不是还有为人民工作的条件吗！毛主席这话真是法宝啊，比什么药都灵！我情绪一下子高起来了。我想，我虽然不能开机器了，可是还可以干别的工作呀！我把矿上的各种工作，仔细想了一遍，自己究竟可以干啥呢？啥都离不开手。我想到了最简单的工作：看大门。对，搬个凳子在大门口一坐，保卫煤矿的安全。有了这个念头以后，自己觉得有了奔头了，锻炼的勇气也更大了。
    这以后，我的身体一天比一天好转，一天比一天强。自己的生活，慢慢基本上能自己照料了，穿衣服也会了，但是扣纽扣还不行，系带子更不行。医院的病号服都是系带子的，每次上厕所都要别人帮忙。人人都有自己的工作嘛，怎么好用这些事去麻烦别人呢？我就想，一定得自己学会。我先把带子的头挽成一个环，用嘴咬住，再用两只手抱住带子的另一头，往那个环里套，慢慢对准，伸进去，套住了，再拉紧，这样就打成了结。套一个环，要用很长很长的时间，有时套不好，就结成了一个死疙瘩。但慢慢时间久了，就熟悉了。现在，衣带、鞋带，我都能自己系。
    克服了一个困难，困难就少了一个，自己能做的事就多了一点。
    每克服了一个困难，解决了一个问题，自己就感到特别高兴。因为克服了一个困难，困难就少了一个，自己能做的事就多了一点，离自己恢复工作的理想就近了一点。这时，给矿上看大门的愿望更有信心实现了。可以走路，有了信，有了条子，就可以上前去接。但是，如果人家送来信件叫我签个字怎么办呢？还不会呀！这样，我又开始拿笔练写字。原先想，拿笔大概很容易，勺子可以抱起来，笔吗，和勺子的区别，不过是一个扁的一个圆的，不是也可以抱起来写么？可是抱起笔以后，两个拳头就把笔尖遮得严严的，歪着头，这边看，那边看，还是看不见笔尖。怎么办？看不见，也凑合着写吧！开始时字写不到格子里，不是写成了一个疙瘩，就是前后没安上，总没法写圆番。有时越练越心慌，真想把笔摔了。可是，一想起自己重新恢复工作、为人民服务的理想，干劲又来了，又拿起笔来，一下一下往下练。经过一个多月的时间，终于写得象个字样子了，能排成行了。我心里有说不出的高兴，头一次就给我们矿上的机电车间支部书记写了一封信。同志们接到信以后，都很高兴，回信鼓励了我一番。自己高兴的盘算着，回到矿上要看大门，签字收文件没问题啦！这个工作我可以担负了，我可以工作了！
    这时我又不满足了，有了更新的愿望。我想看大门的工作太轻，我再锻炼锻炼，还可以为人民做更多的工作。到收发室去行不行？看库房、看女澡塘行不行？我这样想，劲头更大了，觉得自己的生活越来越有意思，越来越幸福。我这是第二回的生命了。这回生命是毛主席是党给我的，应该把它完全献给党，献给人民。我决心更加努力地锻炼下去。
    一九六二年十月，我的烧伤已经基本治好，转到西安医学院第二附属医院整形科修整面部。我还是利用一切空隙时间抓紧锻炼，争取早日出院工作。
    一个人的能力有大小，为人民服务没有一定的范围，做啥事情都是为人民服务。
    开始锻炼，主要还是为了恢复自己的生活能力。后来学习了《为人民服务》，自己想：现在把自己生活的问题解决了一些，把护士任务减轻了，能不能再帮助别人做些事情，锻炼锻炼为人民服务的本领呢？我觉得完全可以。一个人的能力有大小，为人民服务没有一定的范围，做啥事情都是为人民服务。拿眼前的活来说，扫病房呵，帮帮工作人员的忙呵，不都是为人民服务吗！原先自己还有些不好意思，把手一伸，一看，就想算了吧！等到以后回去再说吧！学习《实践论》以后，我看到毛主席说：“如果有了正确的理论，只是把它空谈一阵，束之高阁，并不实行，那末，这种理论再好也是没有意义的。”自己想：《为人民服务》我学习了，也知道是怎么回事啦，但是没有行动起来，这不就是空谈吗？于是，自己行动起来了，并且以后每次学习都注意对照对照自己。病房里，六岁以上的孩子都没有大人陪伴，全靠护士照管。自己便尽量帮忙，给打个洗脸水，买个饭啦。老年人做手术下不了床，自己就给他们帮帮忙。我还练着打扫病房卫生，开始拿笤帚去扫地，心想，这笤帚杆比笔杆大十倍，好掌握，一抱起就可以扫了。可是，一抱起来才知道，抱的过紧，手磨的疼，抱的松了，扫不了三两下就掉了。扫一回地，要费很大的劲。能扫地了，我又练拖地，如果你扫了地，还要人家来拖，不顶啥，还是没给人家节省力气。就这样，在医院的最后一年，一心想着工作，自己的思想非常愉快。
    毛主席给我指明了前进方向，给了我第二次生命，使我能够重新走上工作岗位，我一天也不能离开毛主席著作。
    我在医院，不但治了伤，锻炼了生活能力，更大的收获是开始认真地学习毛主席著作，提高了自己的政治觉悟。毛主席给我指明了前进方向，给了我第二次生命，使我能够重新走上工作岗位，我一天也不能离开毛主席著作。自己文化低，学习主席著作生字很多，有些词句解释不了，往往是把生字摆到那儿，请工作人员或病友来帮助我认。后来，医院的同志代我买了一本字典，自己边学边查，文化也提高啦。在医院里我写了三万多字的日记和学习心得，可是远没有写完自己心里要说的话。
    一九六四年十一月七日，领导上分配我到职工食堂工作。我盼望已久的工作愿望实现了，心里多么激动啊！开始，我在营养灶工作。这个灶主要是为病号服务。食堂工作同志看到我的手都不放心，不让我干活，我总是尽量抢着干。我看见桌子和门窗脏了，就去擦擦，菜拉回来了，煤拉回来了，炊事员都忙着，我就去帮忙搬菜、搬煤。因为天冷，手上长出的新皮比较嫩，有些地方就裂了血口子。同志们看见了都说：“你不要搞了好不好？”可是自己感到，我不能干细活、巧活，应该干点笨活、重活，腾出时间让炊事员多干点细活、巧活，为大家服务好。炊事员比较忙，工作非常累，自己看见他们的工作服脏了，就帮助洗洗；别人压面条，我就去帮助搅压面机；包饺子，我包不成，便擀饺子皮。管理员工作也很忙，我就帮他清点饭票、算账。采煤工谢明旺，住在我的隔壁，他在井下受伤后，开始一段时间不能下床，我就给他送取便盆，把饭菜送到床边，有时饭菜不合口味，就在自己家里给他另做。今年上半年，我们食堂个别年轻同志，认为当炊事员没出息，不安心工作，我就利用工作和休息时间，和他们谈心，给他们读毛主席著作，讲革命故事，使这些同志安下心了，工作也积极了。
    我们食堂的同志，组织起毛主席著作学习小组，反复学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》和《反对自由主义》等文章，在毛主席思想的教导下，同志们进一步认识了做炊事工作的重要性，明确了当炊事员就是干革命，就是为人民服务，因而服务态度端正了，办事公道了，革命干劲也越来越大了，饭菜质量提高了，饭菜花样也由过去每餐两三个，增加到现在的十几个。过去水管出了毛病，矿行政科每次都要派十几个杂工给食堂担水，现在水管出了毛病，炊事人员除保证做好饭菜外，还自己动手担水，保证了食堂所需，给国家节约了开支。
    我一定要牢牢记住党对我的关怀和教导，终生为党好好工作。
    事实一再证明，毛主席思想是照耀我们各项工作的灯塔，是指导我们一切工作和行动的指南。一九六四年十一月，我回到工作岗位以后，仍然坚持了毛主席著作的学习，又写了几万字的心得和笔记，但自己学习得还很差，对毛主席的思想领会的还很不够。因此，今后我要更加努力、更加勤奋地学习毛主席著作，一定要用毛泽东思想不断武装自己的头脑。
    由于自己失去了十个手指，许多同志不断关怀地问我在日常生活活动中有什么困难。现在也向党、向各位领导和同志们汇报一下。我现在完全可以自己照料自己，除了缝衣服以外，梳头、洗头、洗衣服我都能做，连扣子自己也能把它钉上。我也有一个家庭，有爱人，有两个孩子。爱人也在桃园煤矿工作，他要是上早班，我早晨起来就给两个上学的孩子做饭。做啥饭呢？现在除了包饺子，啥都会做，粗茶饭吧，就是没有其他姐妹们做得好，做得细致。切菜吧，我抱着刀，切的稍粗一点，擀面条凑合着也可以，蒸馍、烙饼吧，也行。一九六五年七月，党又把我接到北京来，安装了美容假手，这又使我心里有说不出的激动。是亲爱的党把我从九死一生中救了出来，是亲爱的党让我重新走上工作岗位，现在，亲爱的党又给我安装了假手。我深深感到，那不是一双假手，那是亲爱的党和敬爱的毛主席给他女儿的深情厚意。我一定要牢牢记住党对我的关怀和教导，终生为党好好工作。
