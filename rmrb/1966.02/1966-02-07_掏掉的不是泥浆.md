    Daqing people say: a loose screw means a loose mind; a rusty part means a rusty mind; a leaky gate means a leaky mind. Strictness and meticulousness are the concrete combination of revolutionary spirit and scientific spirit. Let us look at the rigorous and meticulous work style of Daqing people through the following two short articles:
    What Was Scooped Out Was Not Mud...
    Apprentice Zhang Yunzhong
    One day in winter, the second shift was on the four o'clock shift, and Deputy Driller Tang Xi'er led two drillers to remove the pump. The wind was very strong and it was very cold. When the relieving shift arrived at the well site, Tang Xi'er and the others went off duty without checking whether the mud in the pump had been completely drained. The relieving Deputy Driller also took over without checking. The next day, Captain Zhang Shilin discovered that the mud in the pump had not been completely removed. He felt that if this bad work style of not being strict and meticulous was not corrected quickly, greater problems would arise in the future. He promptly convened an on-site meeting.
    The second shift, who were sleeping at home, also rushed to the well site. Captain Zhang said to everyone, "The weather is getting colder every day, and there is no insulation equipment on the well site. As long as we lose a little bit of our sense of responsibility, the equipment will freeze and cause incalculable losses to the country." As he spoke, he showed everyone the mud in the mud pump. He clearly stated: We must resolutely oppose this bad work style of not being strict and meticulous!
    This on-site meeting gave everyone a profound education, especially Tang Xi'er. While scooping out the mud in the pump, he said, "What is being scooped out is not mud, but our bad work style of not being strict and meticulous!" From then on, whenever he removed the pump, regardless of whether the weather was hot or cold, he always scooped out the mud in the pump until it was completely clean.

### 掏掉的不是泥浆……

    大庆人说：螺丝松动，就是思想松动；零件生锈，就是思想生锈；闸门不严，就是思想不严。严和细，就是革命精神和科学精神的具体结合。让我们通过下面两篇短文，看一看大庆人工作中的严细作风吧：
    掏掉的不是泥浆……
    徒工　张云忠
    冬季的一天，二班上四点班，副司钻汤锡贰领着两个钻工撤泵，当时风很大，也很冷。接班的到了井场，汤锡贰几个没有检查泵内的泥浆是否放完就下了班，接班的副司钻也没有检查就接了班。第二天，张石林队长发现泵里的泥浆没有掏净。他觉得如果不赶快纠正这不严不细的坏作风，将来会出现更大的问题。他及时召开了一次现场会。
    正在家里睡觉的二班也赶到了井场。张队长给大家说：“现在天气一天天冷了，井上又无保温设备，只要稍微丧失责任心，就会冻坏设备，给国家造成不可估计的损失。”他一边说，一边让大家看泥浆泵里的泥浆。明确提出：我们要坚决反掉这种不严不细的坏作风！
    这次现场会，使每个人都受到一次深刻的教育，特别是汤锡贰，他一面掏着泵里的泥浆，一面说：“这掏掉的不是泥浆，而是我们不严不细的坏作风！”从此以后，他每逢撤泵的时候，不管天冷天热，总是把泵里的泥浆掏得干干净净。
