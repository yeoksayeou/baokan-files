	Only Cowards are the Most Brutal
	On February 9th, American bandit planes frenziedly bombed residential areas and schools in Xiangxi County, Heping Province, North Vietnam, killing and wounding more than 60 students and peaceful residents. The American aggressors have added a new debt to the blood debts they owe the Vietnamese people.
	When Johnson announced the resumption of bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the end of last month, he shamelessly said that "our air strikes against North Vietnam have been aimed at military targets from the beginning," attempting to use these lies to cover up the barbarous crimes of U.S. imperialism. In fact, for more than a year, the American aggressors have been wantonly bombing and destroying peaceful facilities and massacring peaceful residents in North Vietnam. U.S. imperialism is attempting to use this barbaric means to force the Vietnamese people to submit. The Johnson administration's recent brazen resumption of bombing of North Vietnam is for this very purpose. Some U.S. military and political leaders have openly clamored for "greater punishment" for the people of North Vietnam, actually revealing the vicious conspiracy of the U.S. ruling clique. Johnson's constant talk of "peace" and "humanity" at the Honolulu conference shows how hypocritical he is, and also shows how guilty he is. It is true that only cowards are the most brutal.
	U.S. imperialism can use its bombs to destroy schools, hospitals, and markets in North Vietnam, and massacre peaceful residents in North Vietnam, but it can never shake the will of the 17 million people of North Vietnam to resolutely support their southern compatriots in their struggle against U.S. aggression. On the contrary, the barbaric crimes of the American aggressors will only arouse their stronger hatred. The Vietnamese people will surely respond to the bloody crimes of the American aggressors with even more courageous fighting, resolutely carry the war of resistance against America and for national salvation to the end, and demand repayment of the blood debt from the American bandits!

    唯怯懦者最残暴
    美国强盗飞机九日对越南北方河静省香溪县的居民区学校进行疯狂轰炸，炸死炸伤六十多名学生和和平居民。美国侵略者在欠下越南人民的血债中，又添了新的一笔。
    约翰逊在上月底宣布恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸时，厚颜无耻地说什么“我们对北越的空袭从开始时起一直是针对军事目标”，企图拿这些鬼话来掩饰美帝国主义的野蛮罪行。事实上，美国侵略者在过去一年多一直对越南北方狂轰滥炸破坏和平设施，屠杀和平居民。美帝国主义正是妄图用这种野蛮手段来迫使越南人民屈服。约翰逊政府最近悍然恢复轰炸越南北方，其目的也正在于此。美国的一些军政头目公开叫嚷要对越南北方人民进行“更大的惩罚”，实际上就把美国统治集团的毒辣阴谋和盘托出。约翰逊在檀香山会议上居然满口“和平”、“人道”，这表明他是多么的伪善，同时也表明他是多么的心虚。唯怯懦者最残暴，这真是一点也不错。
    美帝国主义可以用它的炸弹炸毁越南北方的学校、医院和集市，屠杀越南北方的和平居民，但是它决不能动摇越南北方一千七百万人民坚决支持南方骨肉同胞反对美国侵略斗争的意志。相反的，美国侵略者的野蛮罪行，只能激起他们更强烈的仇恨。越南人民必将以更加勇猛的战斗来回答美国侵略者的血腥罪行，坚决把抗美救国斗争进行到底，向美国强盗讨还血债！
