　　He Told Us to Grasp Ideological and Political Work First
　　Lan考 County, Guyang Commune, Qinzhai Brigade Party Branch Secretary Zhao Xinzhen
    Comrade Jiao Yulu came to Lankao County for a little over a year and visited our brigade five times. Each time he came, he made our vision clearer and gave us greater strength.
    In 1963, our brigade's wheat suffered from alkali damage and flooding again, yielding only about thirty catties per mu, and we still had to rely on state relief grain. When the comrades of our Party branch thought about this, their hearts ached like being cut by a knife. How could we get rid of Qinzhai's disaster-stricken label? After discussing it over and over, we couldn't find any good solutions. At this time, we remembered what the leaders often said: when encountering things that can't be done, consult with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Sure enough, after holding a forum with poor and lower-middle peasant commune members, a solution emerged. Old poor peasant commune member Qin Yudong said, "There is good alluvial soil underneath our land. If we dig a few feet deep and turn the alluvial soil up, we can harvest more grain." At that time, the commune members' lives were still very difficult, and deep plowing was heavy work, so some people raised a lot of difficulties. The poor and lower-middle peasant commune members were not intimidated by the difficulties. Everyone said: If we can't work all day, we'll work half a day, plowing one mu at a time. The poor and lower-middle peasants took the lead, setting off a surge of deep plowing.
    One day, we were plowing in the east of the village when Comrade Jiao Yulu arrived. He had his trousers rolled up, was wearing a sweat-soaked shirt that had turned a purplish color, and his face was dripping with sweat from the heat. Without even taking a break, he started talking cordially with the commune members. When he heard that we planned to turn over all the saline-alkali land, he asked with concern, "Is it feasible to deeply plow everything with such a large project?" I told him about the determination of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and he happily said, "Good! You also have the determination of the Foolish Old Man who moved the mountain, and the method of silkworms eating mulberry leaves. The county committee will strongly support you. Are there any other difficulties?" I told him that we didn't have enough tools. He said, "That's easy to solve. I'll have the supply and marketing cooperative send you shovels and mattocks." Before leaving, he also instructed us to arrange the commune members' lives well and pay attention to combining work and rest.
    Not long after, Comrade Jiao Yulu came to Qinzhai Brigade for the second time. This time, he gave us something even more valuable. He patted my arm kindly and said, "How about it, Lao Zhao, are you determined to change the face of this team?" I replied energetically, "I am determined. Just wait and see three years from now!" Comrade Jiao Yulu smiled and said, "Good, then what are you planning to focus on?"
    I thought I had already planned very thoroughly, so I replied, "Focus on controlling alkali and water!" Unexpectedly, he asked again, "What else?" I said, "Focus on fertilizer." He asked again, "What else?" I said, "Focus on pest control." He asked again, "What else?" I couldn't answer. Comrade Jiao Yulu frowned slightly and said earnestly, "Comrade, it's not enough to just focus on these! First, you must grasp class struggle and the ideology of cadres and the masses. Without revolutionary thought, you won't be able to do a good job in production no matter what. To grasp ideology, you must read Chairman Mao's books more and listen to Chairman Mao's words." After a pause, he said, "Work hard. Qinzhai has great potential. There are many difficulties right now, but don't be afraid of them. In the face of difficulties, determination must be greater than the difficulties. Everything is afraid of determination, and you must find a way out in the face of difficulties." Later, Comrade Jiao Yulu also helped us plan drainage channels.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's words were like a fire, warming our hearts and illuminating our minds. From then on, we changed our tendency of not paying attention to grasping politics and ideology. Every time we did something, we tried to do a good job in ideological work. First, from within the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to commune members, we studied Chairman Mao's works extensively. Whenever we had any problems, we consulted Chairman Mao's works. Second, we extensively promoted the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work among the vast number of commune members. At the same time, we also mobilized commune members to talk about the suffering caused by saline-alkali land. Politics is truly the soul of all work. Once we followed Comrade Jiao Yulu's instructions and grasped it, the cadres' thinking changed greatly. Everyone said: "We are servants of the people and cannot watch the commune members suffer, nor can we hold back the country's construction. We must serve the people wholeheartedly like Zhang Side and seize grain from the saline-alkali land." Comrade Jiao Yulu's concern for the commune members made everyone even more grateful. They said: "The Party is so concerned about us, what are we afraid of? From now on, we will work hard with the Party!" "The Foolish Old Man could move mountains, and the strength of our commune is much greater than the Foolish Old Man. If everyone works together, the saline-alkali hollow can be turned into a grain hollow." Each team launched a competition to deeply plow the land and eradicate saline-alkali land. Everyone persisted in plowing the land and controlling alkali, braving the scorching sun in summer and the biting cold wind and frost in winter. When water accumulated in the fields, we drained it. When the ground was frozen solid, we used force to break it open. Our determination grew stronger and stronger. The autumn before last, it rained for seventy days in a row, and some of the deeply plowed land became alkaline again. This did not scare us either. After checking the reasons, we found that we lacked experience in plowing the land at the beginning and messed up the soil. Everyone said: First scrape off a layer of skin from the ground. If that doesn't work, then plow deeper. Difficulties are afraid of tough bones. By the end of last year, the area of land we had deeply plowed had increased dozens of times compared to 1962; we had also built 140 mu of terraced fields. Last year's total grain output increased more than threefold compared to 1962; the commune members had enough to eat and also sold 85,000 catties of grain to the state.
    All the commune members of our brigade are always thinking of Comrade Jiao Yulu. These days, in the fields, in the feeding rooms, and in various meetings, everyone is studying Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds after dinner every day. Every time we study, we gain more strength. Poor peasant commune member Jia Junshan from the Second Production Team said excitedly: "Lao Jiao came through snow and rain despite his serious illness, always thinking about us poor and lower-middle peasants. He broke his heart and risked his life for our Lankao. We must control the saline-alkali no matter what." One night, many commune members from the First Production Team automatically gathered at He Jinzhi's home to study Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds. Tears welled up in their eyes as they listened. Suddenly, Hu Deyun, a poor peasant commune member in his fifties, couldn't hold back any longer. He said, "Folks! Secretary Jiao cares so much about us poor and lower-middle peasants! We can't forget our roots, we must stand tall and work hard!" Communist Youth League member He Zhongli, holding back tears, continued: "Uncle Deyun, we will never forget our roots. We will always follow the Party and fight against heaven and earth. We will not give up until we completely change our appearance!"
    We are studying, examining ourselves, and taking action at the same time. Right now, a new upsurge of changing the world is already underway. When Comrade Jiao Yulu came for the third time, he helped us plan three rivers. In the past, we only dug them three meters wide and one meter deep, which did not meet the standards proposed by Comrade Jiao Yulu at all. If it rained heavily, the crops would still be flooded. Now, everyone is examining this and feels very distressed, and they have proposed to widen the channels to seven meters and deepen them to three meters. The entire brigade only has more than 700 laborers, but more than 1,000 people participate in digging the river every day. Some old people and children in their teens are also vying to participate. They said: "Secretary Jiao was still thinking about our Qinzhai Brigade even when he was dying. How can we not contribute more to changing the face of Qinzhai?" Encouraged by Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit, everyone completed the task that usually took half a month to complete in three days.
    However, Comrade Jiao Yulu's instructions have not been fully realized. In the future, we will learn and apply Chairman Mao's works flexibly like Comrade Jiao Yulu, emphasize politics, and realize ideological revolutionization; follow Comrade Jiao Yulu's instructions during his lifetime, fight against heaven and earth, and use the greatest determination to overcome all kinds of difficulties, make Qinzhai better and better, and contribute more to socialist construction and the world revolution.

　　他告诉我们首先要抓思想政治工作
　　兰考县堌阳公社秦寨大队党支部书记　赵新贞
    焦裕禄同志在兰考县一年多，就来过我们大队五回。他每来一回，都使我们的眼睛看得更远，都给我们增添很大的力量。
    一九六三年，俺大队的麦子又受了碱害和水灾，一亩地才收三十来斤，还得吃国家的救济粮。我们党支部的同志一想到这，心里比刀割还痛。咋着才能把秦寨的灾队帽子摘掉？商量来商量去，也没有找出啥好办法。这时候，我们想起了领导上经常说的话：遇到办不了的事，要找贫下中农商量。果真，开了个贫下中农社员座谈会，办法出来了。老贫农社员秦玉东说：“咱这地下面都是好淤土，挖几尺深把淤土翻上来，就能多收粮食。”当时，社员的生活还很困难，深翻地又是重活，有些人就提出一大堆困难。贫下中农社员们没有被困难吓倒，大家说：咱们不能干一天就干半天，翻一亩是一亩。贫下中农们一马当先，掀起了深翻土地的热潮。
    一天，我们正在村东边翻地，焦裕禄同志来了。他卷着裤腿，穿着一件成了紫花颜色的汗衫，热得脸上直流汗。他连歇也没有歇，就和社员们亲亲热热地谈起来。当他听到我们打算把全部盐碱地都要翻个过儿时，忙关心地问道：“工程这样大，全部深翻能行吗？”我把贫下中农们的决心对他一说，他高兴地说：“好！你们这也是愚公移山的决心，蚕吃桑叶的办法，县委要大力支持你们。还有什么困难没有？”我对他说工具不够。他说：“这好办，让供销社把铁锨、劈铲给你们送来。”临走，他还交代要把社员们生活安排好，注意劳逸结合。
    过了不久，焦裕禄同志二次来到了秦寨大队。这一回，他给的东西更宝贵了，他亲切地拍着我的臂膀说：“咋样老赵，有决心改变这个队的面貌没有？”我满有劲地回答说：“有决心，三年后看吧！”焦裕禄同志笑了笑说：“好，那你准备抓那几手呢？”
    我自己以为已经打算得很周到了，就回答说：“抓治碱治水！”想不到他又问道：“还搞什么？”我说：“抓肥料。”他又问：“还搞什么？”我说：“抓治虫。”他又问：“还搞什么？”我回答不出来了。焦裕禄同志微微皱了皱眉头，语重心长地说：“同志，光抓这些不行啊！首先得抓阶级斗争，抓干部和群众的思想。没有革命思想，咋着也搞不好生产。抓思想，就要多读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话。”停了停，他又说：“好好干吧，秦寨这个地方大有可为。眼下困难多，不要怕它。在困难面前，决心要比困难更大。什么东西都怕决心，要会在困难中找出路。”以后，焦裕禄同志又帮助我们规划了排水渠道。
    焦裕禄同志的话，象一把火，烧得我们心里热乎乎的，照得我们心里亮堂堂的。从此，我们改变了不注意抓政治、不注意抓思想的倾向，每做一件事，都要想法做好思想工作。一是从党内到党外，从干部到社员，大学毛主席著作，有了啥问题，都向毛主席著作请教了。二是在广大社员中大讲自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神。同时，还发动社员诉盐碱地的苦。政治真是一切工作的灵魂。我们照着焦裕禄同志的指示一抓，干部的思想大变了，大家说：“咱是人民的勤务员，不能看着社员们受苦，不能领着社员拉国家建设的腿。咱要象张思德那样全心全意为人民服务，向盐碱地夺粮。”焦裕禄同志对社员们的关心，更是使大家感激。他们说：“党对咱这样关心，咱还怕啥，今后跟着党出劲干啦！”“愚公能够搬大山，咱公社的力量比愚公大多了，大家拧成一股劲干，盐碱窝就能变成粮食窝。”各个队都展开了深翻土地、根治盐碱地的竞赛。大家夏天顶着火一样热的日头，冬天冒着刺骨的寒风和严霜，一直坚持翻地治碱。地里积了水，把它排出来；地冻得梆梆响，用劲把它砸开。我们的决心越来越大。前年秋天连下七十天雨，有些深翻过的地里又有了碱。这也没有把我们吓倒。我们一检查原因，是开初翻地没有经验，把土搞乱了。大家说：先把地里刮去一层皮，不行了，再深翻。困难就怕硬骨头。到去年年底，我们深翻的土地面积，比一九六二年扩大了几十倍；还修成台田一百四十亩。去年粮食总产量比一九六二年增长三倍多；社员有了吃的，还向国家交售粮食八万五千斤。
    我们大队的全体社员，时时都在怀念着焦裕禄同志。这些天，在田里，在饲养室里，在各种各样的会议上，每天吃过晚饭后，大家都在学习焦裕禄同志的事迹，每学习一回，就添一分力量。第二生产队的贫农社员贾俊山激动地说：“老焦带着重病雪里来雨里去，心里老想着咱贫下中农，他为咱兰考操碎了心，拼上了命，咱说啥也得把盐碱治住。”一天晚上，第一生产队的不少社员自动地聚集在贺进枝家里，学习焦裕禄同志的事迹。他们听着眼里扑哒扑哒地落泪，突然，五十多岁的贫农社员胡德运忍不住了，他说：“爷们！焦书记对咱贫下中农多关心呀！咱可不能忘本，要挺起腰杆子干哪！”共青团员贺中立忍着泪接着说：“德运大爷，我们决不会忘本，我们要永远跟着党，和天斗争，和地斗争，不彻底改变面貌，誓不罢休！”
    我们一边学习，一边检查对照，一边行动。眼下，一个改天换地的新高潮已经掀了起来。焦裕禄同志第三次来时，帮助我们规划了三条河道。过去我们只挖了三米宽、一米来深，根本没有达到焦裕禄同志提议的标准，要是雨大了，照样还要淹坏庄稼。现在大家检查起来，都很痛心，纷纷提出来要把渠道加到七米宽、三米深。全大队只有七百多个劳动力，每天参加挖河的人竟有一千多个。一些老人和十来岁的孩子，都争着参加。他们说：“焦书记临死还想着咱秦寨大队，咱咋能不为改变秦寨的面貌多出点力。”大家在焦裕禄同志的革命精神鼓舞下，用了三天时间就完成了平常需要半个月完成的任务。
    但是，焦裕禄同志对我们的指示还没有完全实现。今后，我们要象焦裕禄同志那样活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治，实现思想革命化；遵照焦裕禄同志生前的指示，和天斗争，和地斗争，用最大的决心，战胜各种各样的困难，把秦寨变得越来越好，为社会主义建设，为世界革命多多贡献力量。
