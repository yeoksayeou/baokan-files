    Dedicating a Red Heart to the People
    An Ode to Jiao Yulu
    Yang Pu
    After reading "The Model of a County Party Secretary—Jiao Yulu," tears welled up, and my heart surged: this county party secretary is so outstanding, this Communist Party member is so towering! The steel warrior Mai Xiande wrote a line in his poem: "Dedicating a red heart to the people." Comrade Jiao Yulu is precisely a revolutionary fighter who "dedicates a red heart to the people!"
      "For the people," he pondered day and night, exhausting his energy. To overcome the three scourges of waterlogging, windblown sand, and saline-alkali soil that weighed heavily on the people of Lankao County, how many days of agonizing thought did Jiao Yulu spend, how many sleepless nights did he endure! Late at night, he confided in the deputy secretary of the county party committee, leading the county committee members to see the station in the bitter wind and snow…; he tried every means, planned and strategized, exhausting his energy and racking his brains.
      "For the people," he traveled extensively and exerted all his strength. During the year or so he worked in Lankao County, Jiao Yulu braved the severe cold, faced the wind and snow, waded through floods, investigated wind gaps, explored drifting sand, and observed water conditions in order to change the face of Lankao County, dedicating all his energy; going deep into the grassroots, focusing on exemplary models, mobilizing the masses, working hard, and exerting his greatest strength.
      "For the people," he worked selflessly and devoted himself heart and soul. He came to Lankao County to work with a serious illness. To overcome the "three scourges," Jiao Yulu completely disregarded his own pain, working selflessly for the people, truly achieving "devotion to duty until death."
    Comrade Jiao Yulu "scooped out" his revolutionary red heart and pressed it tightly against the bodies of the people, without the slightest reservation, truly reaching the point of "dedicating" everything. He was anxious about what the people were anxious about, worried about what the people were worried about, wholeheartedly for the people, everything for the people; the people, the interests of the people—were the starting point and the end result of his thoughts and actions. The so-called "dedicating" is the "completely" and "thoroughly" that Chairman Mao taught us in serving the people. Jiao Yulu did exactly as Chairman Mao instructed. An old saying goes, "Dedicate oneself to the cause until death." Jiao Yulu "dedicated his red heart to the people," to the point of "dedication to duty until death." Listen to his last words: "I have only one request after my death, to ask the organization to transport me back to Lankao and bury me on the sand dunes. When I was alive, I didn't cure the sand dunes, and after I die, I want to watch you cure the sand dunes!" From this sentence, we can thoroughly see Comrade Jiao Yulu's boundless loyalty to the people, "devoting himself to the cause until death."
      "I am your son." – This was Jiao Yulu's reply to the elderly in the homes of two helpless old people on a snowy day. Jiao Yulu saw himself as the son of the people. That's right! Jiao Yulu is the son of the people, and a good son of the people!
    What made Jiao Yulu have a revolutionary "red heart"? And what taught him to "dedicate" this red heart to the people? After his death, people found two books under his pillow: one was "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and the other was "On Communist Party Members' Self-Cultivation." The matter of placing two books under the pillow provides the answer to this question.

    掏尽红心为人民
    一赞焦裕禄
    杨浦
    读罢《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》，热泪盈眶，心潮翻滚：这位县委书记是那么的出色，这个共产党员是何等的高大！钢铁战士麦贤得写的诗中有这么一句：“掏尽红心为人民”，焦裕禄同志就是一个“掏尽红心为人民”的革命战士！
      “为人民”，他日思夜虑，费尽心血。为了战胜压在兰考县人民身上的内涝、风沙、盐碱这三害，焦裕禄度过了多少苦思之日，经历了多少不眠之夜！深更半夜，他找县委副书记谈心，领着县委委员们去看风雪严寒中的车站……；他想方设法，运筹划策，费尽了心血，绞尽了脑汁。
      “为人民”，他东奔西走，使尽力气。在兰考县工作的一年多时间里，焦裕禄为了改变兰考县的面貌，冒严寒，迎风雪，涉大水，查风口，探流沙，察水势，付出了全部的精力；深入基层，狠抓典型，发动群众，艰苦奋斗，使出了最大的力气。
      “为人民”，他奋不顾身，鞠躬尽瘁。他是带着严重的疾病来到兰考县工作的，为了战胜“三害”，焦裕禄把自己的病痛完全置之度外，忘我地为人民工作，真正做到了“鞠躬尽瘁”。
    焦裕禄同志把自己的一颗革命红心“掏”了出来，紧紧地贴在人民的身上，没有一丝一毫的保留，确确实实达到了“掏尽”的程度。他急人民之所急，忧人民之所忧，一心为人民，一切为人民；人民，人民的利益——就是他所思所行的出发点和落脚处。所谓“掏尽”，就是毛主席教导我们的为人民服务要“完全”，要“彻底”。焦裕禄正是按照毛主席的指示做的。古话说：“鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”焦裕禄“掏尽红心为人民”，简直是到了“鞠躬尽瘁，死而不已”的地步。请听听他临终前的话吧：“我死后只有一个要求，要求组织上把我运回兰考，埋在沙堆上，活着我没有治好沙丘，死了也要看着你们把沙丘治好！”从这句话中，我们可以透彻地看到焦裕禄同志的为人民“鞠躬尽瘁，死而不已”的无限忠心。
      “我是您的儿子。”——这是一个大风雪天焦裕禄同志在两个无依无靠的老人家里对老人的一句答话。焦裕禄就是这样把自己看作是人民的儿子的。对！焦裕禄就是人民的儿子，而且是人民的好儿子！
    是什么东西使焦裕禄有一颗革命的“红心”的呢？又是什么东西教他把这颗红心“掏尽”来为人民的呢？他死后，人们在他的病榻的枕下，发现了两部书：一部是《毛泽东选集》，一部是《论共产党员的修养》。枕下放着两部书的事情，就为这个问题提供了答案。
