    For almost an entire generation of young Americans, military service has been something for others to worry about. In the two World Wars and the Korean conflict, military service provided strength to the United States, but in recent years, conscription has been carried out gently and quietly. The number of people conscripted each year averages less than 100,000, a very small proportion of the entire eligible population. It is not difficult to apply for deferment for reasons of schooling or skills. Young Americans view military service either as a distant threat, or at worst as a short-term job with the reward of overseas service and travel (46 percent of American soldiers are stationed overseas) or the acquisition of a skill useful in civilian life later.
    The escalation of the Vietnam War has completely changed this situation. Military service seems to have suddenly become the most pressing issue in the lives of every American man between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six.
    With the military's manpower needs constantly increasing, and with the number of people drafted each month in the future greatly exceeding 30,000, thousands of people who could have been deferred or completely avoided military service will soon be drafted. All over the United States, young people are once again anxiously watching their mailboxes, worried that they will see the nation's most unwelcome unsolicited mail - a long postcard with the letters "1-A" written in the blank space indicating the draft category. ("1-A" is the category for those who are immediately drafted.)
    Why is this postcard so frightening? The reason is that the recipient is very likely to be sent to a place where combat is taking place. In early 1965, the United States had only 23,300 people in Vietnam, of whom less than one percent were new recruits. Now, the number of American troops in Vietnam is nearly 200,000 (note: it has now exceeded 200,000), of whom new recruits account for 20 percent. As the number of troops increases, this proportion seems likely to rise further.
    The new conscription requirements have caused anxiety and opposition among American youth. Due to the nature of the Vietnam War, the reaction to military service is now different from any in the past. There is no obvious enemy, and there seems to be no morale. The most extreme examples of opposition to military service are burning draft cards and contempt of court... But even draftees who generally do not oppose the Vietnam War do not fully understand the war and lack a strong motivation to join the fight.
    American university campuses have long been havens for avoiding military service. Now, this haven is under threat. In order to fill the expanded quota, conscription boards in many places have drafted all eligible, qualified, and non-deferred single men, and have virtually drafted married men without children, and as a result have had to tap the manpower resources of the universities. As of last week, college students are generally no longer automatically deferred; they can be drafted to supplement the conscription quota when necessary.
    Of course, the most difficult job for the conscription board is deciding who should be deferred among the 17,977,000 Americans between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six. Of these, 5.5 million people who are serving or have completed their service are not subject to conscription. Of the remaining 12 million people on the roster, about 83 percent are deferred. This includes 2 million students, 3 million people with children, and 200,000 people holding "essential" jobs in industrial enterprises or farms. Foreigners, pastors, and seminarians are also automatically deferred. The most striking fact is that a large number of deferments, four million, are for people who are rejected by the military due to physical or mental defects. Half of the unqualified draftees fail the military's intelligence tests. But the situation is equally lamentable in terms of physical standards. Most physically unqualified people have bone or limb diseases or defects, followed by mental disorders, followed by circulatory problems and eye diseases. Many conscripts talk about using tricks to obtain exemptions - these tricks include not sleeping for forty-eight hours before the test, eating a lot of sugar the night before the test to produce symptoms of diabetes, and smoking cigarettes dipped in blue ink so that spots appear on the lungs. But not many people actually do this, and even fewer are able to deceive the army's keen-eyed doctors.

    美国征兵难
    ——摘译自二月四日美国《时代》周刊
    在几乎整整一代美国年轻人看来，服兵役一直是别人去操心的事。在两次世界大战和朝鲜冲突中，兵役为美国提供了力量，但是近些年来，征兵是和缓地、不声张地进行的。每年征召的人平均不到十万，占整个适龄入伍者的比例很小。以求学或者技能的原因而要求缓役，是不困难的。美国青年认为服兵役或者是一个遥远的威胁，或者在最坏的情况下也不过是打短工，而得到海外服役旅行的报酬（美国士兵的百分之四十六驻在海外）或是获得一项日后在平民生活中有用的技能。
    越南战争的升级完全改变了这些情况。服兵役似乎突如其来地成为从十八岁到二十六岁之间的每一个美国男子生活中最紧迫的问题。
    随着军队人力需要不断的增加，以及未来每月征召人数大大超过三万人，在这样的情况下，成千上万本来可以缓期服役或完全逃避兵役的人不久就要被征入伍了。在美国各地，青年人又一次焦急不安地注视着他们的信箱，担心会看到全国最不受欢迎的不请自来的邮件——一张长长的明信片，在明信片上注明征兵类别的空白地方写着“1—A”字样。（“1—A”类是立即被征入伍的一类）。
    为什么这张明信片这样叫人胆战心惊呢？原因是收信人很可能被派到战斗正在进行的地方去。一九六五年初，美国在越南只有二万三千三百人，其中新兵不到百分之一，现在，美国在越南的部队人数近二十万（注：目前已超过二十万），其中新兵占百分之二十。随着部队的增加，这个比例看来还要上升。
    征兵的新要求引起美国青年的不安和反对。由于越南战争的性质关系，现在对服兵役的反应也与过去任何一次不同。没有显而易见的敌人，看不出有什么士气。反对服兵役的最极端的例子是烧毁征兵证、蔑视法院……但是甚至一般不反对越南战争的应征者也不完全理解这个战争，缺乏强烈的动力来参加战斗。
    美国的大学校园，长久以来一直是逃避兵役的庇护所。现在，这个庇护所受到了威胁。许多地方的征兵局为了填满扩大了的定额，已经把可征的合格的、不应缓役的单身汉征光了，也实际上把无子女的已婚男子征完了，结果不得不触动大学的人力来源。从上周起，一般说来，大学生不再自动地缓役了，必要时可以征召他们来补充征兵额。
    当然，征兵局最困难的工作是决定一千七百九十七万从十八岁到二十六岁的美国人谁该缓役。其中，首先有五百五十万正在服役或已经服役期满的人，是不在征召之列的。在剩下的一千二百万在名册上的人中，百分之八十三左右是缓役的。这里面有两百万名学生，三百万名有儿女的，二十万名在工业企业或农场担任“主要”工作的。外国人、牧师、神学生也是自动缓役的。最引人注意的事实是为数四百万的大量缓役者，是因为体力或智力的缺陷被军队所排斥的人。不合格的应征者半数是在军队的智力测验方面不及格。但是在体格标准方面，情况也同样可悲。大多数体力不合格的人是因为骨骼或肢体有病或有缺陷，其次是精神失常，再次是循环系统的毛病和眼疾。许多应召者谈到使用诡计以获得免役资格——这些诡计包括受测验以前四十八小时不睡觉，受测验前晚大量吃糖以产生糖尿病症象，吸在蓝墨水里浸过的香烟，以便肺上呈现斑点。但是真正这样做的人并不多，而能够骗过陆军的目光敏锐的医生的为数更少。
