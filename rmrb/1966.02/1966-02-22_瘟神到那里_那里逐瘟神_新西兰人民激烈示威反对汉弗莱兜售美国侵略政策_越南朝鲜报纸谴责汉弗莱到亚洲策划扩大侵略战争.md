　　Wherever the Plague God Goes, He is Expelled
　　New Zealand People Fiercely Demonstrate Against Humphrey's Peddling of American Aggression Policies
　　Vietnamese and Korean Newspapers Condemn Humphrey's Visit to Asia to Plot the Expansion of the War of Aggression
　　According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 21st: The Vietnamese newspaper *People's Daily* published a commentary on February 21st, pointing out that U.S. Vice President Humphrey's activities in South Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, India, Australia, the Philippines, and other places constitute a new crime of the Johnson group in expanding its war of aggression.
    The commentary pointed out that Humphrey's words and deeds, from the beginning of his departure to the present, are filled with the odor of warmongering.
    The commentary pointed out that after Humphrey's arrival in the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, he will also visit South Korea and Japan. This shows that the Johnson group is vigorously forcing its lackeys to make more "contributions" to the war of aggression against Vietnam, not only in terms of material resources, but more importantly, to provide cannon fodder to serve as substitutes for the American aggressor troops. Humphrey's activities also precisely illustrate the embarrassing situation of the American aggressors in the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 21st: The Korean *Rodong Sinmun* published a commentary on February 21st on U.S. Vice President Humphrey's ongoing activities in Asia and his upcoming "visit" to Seoul on the 22nd, pointing out that the purpose of Humphrey's activities is to collect more cannon fodder from Asian puppets in order to implement the plan to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam that was plotted at the Honolulu conference. The commentary said that the purpose of Humphrey's trip to Seoul on the 22nd is also to get South Korea to provide more cannon fodder.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: Wellington Dispatch: Wherever the plague god goes, he is expelled. When U.S. Vice President Humphrey arrived in the New Zealand capital on the 20th to peddle the U.S. policy of strengthening the war of aggression against Vietnam, he was met with demonstrations from the New Zealand public everywhere, who shouted, "Yankee, go home!"
    According to the Associated Press, one demonstrator attacked Humphrey's car. When Humphrey got out of the car, he "appeared to be a little shaken." Police who intervened clashed fiercely with the demonstrators. He did not enter the American embassy until the police pushed the demonstrators away.
    After Humphrey "recovered his spirits" at the American embassy, he proceeded to the New Zealand Parliament Building under the escort of a large number of security personnel. At this time, some demonstrators who were blocked by the police intentionally shouted the Nazi salute "Sieg Heil" to welcome Hitler, to express their opposition to the arrival of a Hitler-like figure.
    In order to avoid the hundreds of demonstrators in front of the parliament building, Humphrey had his car driven to the side gate of the parliament, and he entered the parliament building through the side gate.
    Before Humphrey arrived at the parliament building, hundreds of demonstrators who braved the rain to protest held up placards that read: "We oppose the Vietnam War," "Many New Zealanders support us."
    Under the escort of the New Zealand authorities, the U.S. Vice President held a press conference, delivered a radio speech, and attended a banquet hosted by New Zealand Prime Minister Holyoake, trying his best to peddle the U.S. government's policy of aggression against Vietnam.
    Humphrey also promoted the U.S. policy of allying with the Soviet Union against China, saying that Western countries and the Soviet Union have reached "a better understanding," "We believe that the Soviet Union is a force for world stability," "while the Beijing regime is another matter."

　　瘟神到那里　那里逐瘟神
　　新西兰人民激烈示威反对汉弗莱兜售美国侵略政策
　　越南朝鲜报纸谴责汉弗莱到亚洲策划扩大侵略战争
    据新华社河内二十一日电  越南《人民报》二十一日发表评论指出，美国副总统汉弗莱到南越、泰国、老挝、印度、澳大利亚、菲律宾和其他一些地方进行活动，是约翰逊集团扩大侵略战争的一个新罪行。
    评论指出，汉弗莱从开始出发到现在，他的言行都充满着好战的气味。
    评论指出，汉弗莱到了菲律宾、澳大利亚和新西兰后，还要去南朝鲜、日本访问。这表明，约翰逊集团正在大力迫使他们的仆从为侵略越南的战争作出更多的“贡献”，不仅是在物力方面，更重要的是要他们提供炮灰，充当美国侵略军的替死鬼。汉弗莱的这些活动也正好说明了美国侵略者在侵略越南战争中狼狈不堪的处境。
    据新华社平壤二十一日电  朝鲜《劳动新闻》二十一日就美国副总统汉弗莱正在亚洲进行的活动和即将于二十二日到汉城进行“访问”发表评论指出，汉弗莱活动的目的，是为了从亚洲傀儡中搜罗更多的炮灰，以便把檀香山会议策划的扩大侵越战争计划付诸实施。评论说，汉弗莱二十二日汉城之行的目的也是要南朝鲜提供更多的炮灰。
    据新华社二十一日讯　惠灵顿消息：瘟神到那里，那里逐瘟神。美国副总统汉弗莱二十日在到达新西兰首都兜售美国加强侵越战争的政策时，到处都遇到新西兰公众的示威，他们高呼“美国佬，滚回去！”
    据美联社报道，有一个示威者袭击了汉弗莱的汽车。汉弗莱走出汽车时“看来有点发抖”。进行干涉的警察同示威者发生了激烈的冲突。直到警察把示威者推开，他才走进了美国大使馆。
    汉弗莱在美国大使馆“恢复了精神”以后，在一大批保安人员的保驾下前往新西兰议会大厦。这时，一些被警察拦阻住的示威群众有意呼喊纳粹分子欢迎希特勒的口号“胜利万岁”，来表示他们反对一个希特勒式人物的到来。
    汉弗莱为了避开议会门前的数百名示威者，让汽车开到议会的边门，他从边门走进议会大厦。
    在汉弗莱到议会大厦以前，冒雨举行示威的数百名群众高举的标语牌上写着：“我们反对越南战争”，“许多新西兰人都支持我们”。
    这个美国副总统在新西兰当局的保驾下，举行了记者招待会，发表了广播演说，出席了新西兰总理霍利约克的宴会，竭力兜售美国政府的侵越政策。
    汉弗莱还鼓吹美国的联苏反华政策，他说，西方国家同苏联已经达成“一个较好的谅解”，“我们认为苏联是世界稳定的一支力量”，“而北京政权则是另一回事”。
