    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th – According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the Liberation Army of Jin'ou Province, South Vietnam, magically and ingeniously entered Jin'ou City in the early morning of January 28th, using bombs to destroy an American military dormitory, killing ninety-three American invading soldiers and fifty-seven puppet soldiers.
    In January of this year, nearly four hundred American invading soldiers were stationed in Jin'ou City. These American bandits, terrified by the Liberation Army's surprise attack, ordered their lackeys to implement strict defense upon their arrival. However, the Jin'ou Province Liberation Army was determined to severely punish the American bandits. At 2:00 AM on January 28th, they secretly infiltrated Jin'ou City, cleverly overcoming the puppet army's heavy defenses, and used bombs to destroy a two-story American military dormitory, killing ninety-three American invading bandits on the spot, and also taking the lives of fifty-seven puppet soldiers.
