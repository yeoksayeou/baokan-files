    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th—According to supplementary war reports released here, the Vietnamese People's Army Air Force took off on the 3rd to intercept invading American bandit aircraft, shooting down two enemy planes.

    On the 3rd, multiple batches of American jet fighter-bombers bombed and strafed residential areas in northern Nghe An province. In addition to the three planes already reported shot down by local soldiers and civilians, the Vietnamese People's Air Force also took off to intercept enemy planes, shooting down two American jet aircraft. Thus, a total of five American bandit planes were shot down on the 3rd alone.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th—According to a report from the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, guerrillas in the three counties of Dai Loc, Dien Ban, and Duy Xuyen in northern Quang Nam province, South Vietnam, fiercely attacked the American and puppet troops who came to "sweep" through the area in the eight days from January 10th to 17th, killing and wounding nearly 400 enemies, including more than 300 American aggressor troops, shooting down four American planes, and sinking one enemy speedboat.

    The report stated that the American and puppet clique had conducted continuous bombing and strafing of the northern Dai Loc county, western Duy Xuyen county, and villages along the Thu Bon River in Quang Nam province for several days and nights starting on January 5th. Then, on January 10th, they dispatched two battalions of puppet troops, under the cover of eighteen M-113 amphibious armored vehicles and aircraft artillery, to conduct a "sweep" of Duy Xuyen county. The next day, American aggressor troops dispatched another two battalions to conduct a "sweep" of some areas in Dai Loc and Dien Ban counties.

    Wherever the enemy went, they burned, killed, looted, and committed all kinds of evil deeds. Filled with deep hatred for the enemy, the guerrilla fighters in northern Quang Nam province gave these bandits a fierce blow.

    In Duy Xuyen county, the guerrillas continuously attacked the enemy from the start, killing and wounding twenty enemies with sniper fire, including three American aggressors, and shooting down an American F-105 aircraft, killing one American pilot on the spot. Subsequently, on the 15th, the guerrillas ambushed a troop of enemy soldiers, annihilating twenty-one enemies and shooting down an enemy transport plane. The guerrillas also assisted the people in demolishing three "strategic hamlets" in Duy An commune.

    In Dai Loc county, on the night of the 11th, the guerrillas heroically and successively attacked American aggressor troops entrenched in Dai Phong commune and Gia Coc town, annihilating approximately forty American aggressor troops. At the same time, guerrillas in Dai Minh commune also sank an enemy speedboat, annihilating all the American troops on board.

    On the 15th, guerrillas in this county annihilated an entire company of American aggressor troops and shot down two American aircraft.

    After fiercely attacking the enemy troops who came to "sweep" through the area, Dien Ban county guerrillas also attacked an enemy stronghold in Dien Hoa commune on the night of the 15th, annihilating sixty-seven enemies and seizing twenty-five weapons.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th—According to a report from the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency: The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces Command recently decided to award the First Class Liberation Military Service Medal to the meritorious unit that attacked the American officer dormitory on Da Lat city's Do Ly street on December 31st of last year.

    According to supplementary reports, this heroic unit killed and wounded more than seventy American aggressors in this battle, many of whom were American military intelligence personnel and technicians, and destroyed three military vehicles.

    The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces Command also decided to award the Second Class Liberation Military Service Medal to the soldiers and civilians of Cu Chi district, Gia Dinh province. From January 8th to 19th of this year, in the battle against the large-scale "sweep" by American aggressor troops and their lackeys, the Liberation Armed Forces and people of this county annihilated 1,318 enemy troops in one fell swoop, including killing and wounding 1,289 American aggressor troops, and seizing a large number of weapons and military supplies.
