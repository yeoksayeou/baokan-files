    China's Foreign Ministry Issues Statement
    Strongly Protesting US Aircraft Attack on Chinese Consulate General in Phong Saly
    The US aircraft bombing of Phong Saly demonstrates that the aggressive claws of US imperialism have extended to the entire Laos; the attack on our Consulate General is yet another direct provocation against the Chinese people by it and its followers. The Chinese government and the Chinese people express great indignation at this.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on February 19th, strongly protesting the US aircraft's heinous act of attacking the Chinese Consulate General in Phong Saly on February 18th, causing serious damage to the consulate's buildings and property. The statement pointed out that this is the third time US aircraft have bombed Chinese diplomatic missions in Laos, and is yet another direct provocation against the Chinese people by it and its followers in expanding the Indochina war.
    The full text of the statement is as follows:
    Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
                                February 19, 1966
    On the morning of February 18, four US jet fighter-bombers intruded into Phong Saly City in northern Laos to bomb and strafe, and attacked the Chinese Consulate General in Phong Saly, causing serious damage to the buildings and property of our Consulate General. This is yet another direct provocation against the Chinese people by US imperialism and its followers in expanding the Indochina war. The Chinese government and the Chinese people express great indignation and strong protest against this heinous act of US imperialism and its followers.
    In order to coordinate with its war of aggression in South Vietnam, US imperialism has been intensifying its military actions in Laos. It has stepped up its indiscriminate bombing of the Lao liberated areas. It has instigated and directed the Lao right-wing army and the Kong Le forces to launch large-scale offensives against the Lao patriotic forces in the Phou Khout area of Upper Laos and the Bolovens Plateau area of Lower Laos. A few days ago, US Vice President Humphrey was still hypocritically saying in Vientiane that the United States has "only one wish" for Laos and all countries, which is that "people can live in peace." However, at this very moment, US aircraft have further expanded the bombing range and dropped bombs on cities in northern Laos. The US aircraft bombing of Phong Saly demonstrates that the aggressive claws of US imperialism have extended to the entire Laos. The so-called US hope that the Lao "people can live in peace" is actually to wage an all-out war in Laos.
    This is the third time that US aircraft have bombed Chinese diplomatic missions in Laos. This is a completely deliberate act of provocation. The Lao authorities in Vientiane actually allow US aircraft to do this again and again, and cannot shirk its responsibility. The Chinese government solemnly points out that the Lao authorities are willing to act as accomplices of US imperialism in expanding the Indochina war, undermining the Geneva Accords, and adopting a hostile attitude towards the Chinese people. This is contrary to the wishes of the Lao people and will not end well.
    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, February 19: On the morning of February 18, four US jet aircraft raided Phong Saly and strafed the Chinese Consulate General in Phong Saly, causing serious damage to the buildings and property of the Chinese Consulate General.
    This is another serious provocation against the Chinese people by US imperialism and its Lao followers in expanding the war.
    At 8:15 a.m. on February 18
    (Laos time), four US aircraft swooped down on and strafed the Chinese Consulate General in Phong Saly, firing more than 600 bullets. The consulate courtyard was hit by more than 200 bullets, and the buildings were hit by more than 50 bullets, with some buildings destroyed. At the same time, US aircraft dropped eight bombs east of Phong Saly City.
    After the US aircraft left, representatives of the Lao Genuine Neutral Forces stationed in Phong Saly and representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front stationed in Phong Saly went to the Chinese Consulate General to express their condolences.

### 我国外交部发表声明  强烈抗议美机袭击我驻丰沙里总领事馆

    我国外交部发表声明
    强烈抗议美机袭击我驻丰沙里总领事馆
    美机对丰沙里的轰炸，表明美帝侵略魔爪已伸到整个老挝；袭击我总领事馆，是它和它的追随者又一次对中国人民的直接挑衅。中国政府和中国人民对此表示极大愤慨。
    新华社十九日讯　中国外交部十九日发表声明，强烈抗议美国飞机十八日袭击中国驻丰沙里总领事馆，造成总领事馆房屋、财产遭受严重损失的罪恶行为。声明指出，这是美国飞机第三次轰炸中国驻老挝的外交代表机构，也是它和它的追随者在扩大印度支那战争中又一次对中国人民的直接挑衅。
    声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
                                一九六六年二月十九日
    二月十八日上午，四架美国喷气式战斗轰炸机侵入老挝北部对丰沙里市进行轰炸、扫射，并且袭击了中国驻丰沙里总领事馆，造成我总领馆房屋、财产的严重损失。这是美帝国主义及其追随者在扩大印度支那战争中又一次对中国人民的直接挑衅。中国政府和中国人民对于美帝国主义及其追随者的这一罪恶行为，表示极大的愤慨和强烈的抗议。
    美帝国主义为了配合在南越的侵略战争，一直在老挝加强军事行动。它变本加厉地对老挝解放区进行狂轰滥炸。它唆使并指挥老挝右派军队、贡勒部队向上寮富科特山地区和下寮波罗芬高原地区的老挝爱国力量发动大规模的进攻。几天前，美国副总统汉弗莱还在万象假惺惺地说，美国对老挝和所有国家“只有一个愿望”，这就是“人民能够和平地生活”。但是，就在这个时候，美国的飞机却进一步扩大轰炸范围，把炸弹扔到老挝北部城市。美国飞机对丰沙里市的轰炸，表明美帝国主义的侵略魔爪已经伸到整个老挝。美国的所谓希望老挝“人民能够和平地生活”，实际上就是要在老挝进行一场全面的战争。
    美国飞机轰炸中国驻老挝的外交代表机构，已经是第三次了。这完全是蓄意的挑衅行为。在万象的老挝当局竟然容许美国飞机一而再、再而三地这样干，也决不能推卸它应负的责任。中国政府严正指出，老挝当局甘心充当美帝国主义扩大印度支那战争的走卒，破坏日内瓦协议，并且对中国人民采取敌视态度，这是违背老挝人民的愿望的，也是决不会有什么好下场的。
    新华社康开十九日电　四架美国喷气式飞机十八日上午空袭丰沙里，扫射中国驻老挝丰沙里总领事馆，造成中国总领事馆房屋和财产的严重损失。
    这是美帝国主义及其老挝追随者在扩大战争中对中国人民的又一次严重挑衅。
    二月十八日八时十五分
  （老挝时间），四架美国飞机向中国驻丰沙里总领事馆建筑物俯冲并进行扫射，发射子弹六百多发。总领事馆院内中弹二百余处，房屋中弹五十多处，部分房屋被毁。同时，美机在丰沙里市以东投弹八枚。
    美机离去后，老挝真正中立力量驻丰沙里代表和老挝爱国战线党驻丰沙里代表等先后到中国总领事馆表示慰问。
