    Comrade Jiao Yulu was born on August 16, 1922, in a poor peasant family in Beigushan Village, Zibo City, Shandong Province. Due to difficult living conditions, he only attended school for a few years in his childhood and then participated in labor at home.
    In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, the exploitation and oppression of the laboring people by Japanese invaders, traitors, and Kuomintang reactionaries became increasingly cruel, and Comrade Jiao Yulu's family's life became more and more difficult. During the most arduous years of the Anti-Japanese War, his father, driven to desperation, was forced to hang himself. During the period of Japanese puppet rule, Comrade Jiao Yulu was repeatedly arrested, beaten, and imprisoned by the Japanese invaders, and later押送 was sent to the Fushun Coal Mine as a coolie. Unable to endure the cruelty of the Japanese invaders, Comrade Jiao Yulu escaped from danger in the autumn of 1943 and returned home. Unable to make a living, he fled to Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, and worked as a long-term laborer for a landlord surnamed Hu for two years.
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, Comrade Jiao Yulu returned to his hometown from Suqian County. Although his hometown had not yet been liberated at that time, the Communist Party was already leading the masses in revolutionary activities here, and Comrade Jiao Yulu volunteered to become a militiaman. After becoming a militiaman, he participated in the battle to liberate Boshan County.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu joined the Chinese Communist Party in January 1946 in his village. Soon after, he officially joined the work of the armed forces department of the county district, leading the local militia to persist in guerrilla warfare. During the Liberation War, he led the militia to participate in many battles, and later he was transferred to the Shandong Bohai area to participate in the land reform review work team, serving as the leader.
    In the later period of the Liberation War, Comrade Jiao Yulu left Shandong with the army and went to Henan, where he was assigned to work in Weishi County until 1951; he successively served as Deputy District Chief, District Chief, Deputy Secretary of the District Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Deputy Secretary of the County Committee of the Communist Youth League. Afterward, he was successively transferred to work in the Chenliu Prefectural Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Zhengzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Youth League, serving as the Minister of Propaganda of the Prefectural Committee of the League and the Second Deputy Secretary.
    In June 1953, Comrade Jiao Yulu responded to the call of the Party and was transferred to the Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory to participate in industrial construction. Until 1962, he served as a workshop director and section chief in this factory. During this period, Comrade Jiao Yulu also interned at the Dalian Crane Factory for more than a year. In June 1962, in order to strengthen rural work, Comrade Jiao Yulu was transferred back to Weishi County, serving as the Secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat. In December 1962, Comrade Jiao Yulu was transferred to Lankao County, serving as the Second Secretary and Secretary of the County Party Committee.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu unfortunately passed away on May 14, 1964. He was forty-two years old.
    During his eighteen years of participation in the revolution, Comrade Jiao Yulu consistently listened to the words of the Party and Chairman Mao, remained loyal and devoted, and struggled for the proletarian revolutionary cause throughout his life. Comrade Jiao Yulu deserves to be called a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong and a good example for the vast number of cadres in our country.

    焦裕禄同志，山东省淄博市北崮山村人，一九二二年八月十六日出生在一个贫农家庭里。因为生活困难，幼年时代只读了几年书就在家参加劳动。
    抗日战争初期，日寇、汉奸和国民党反动派对劳动人民的剥削和压迫越来越残酷，焦裕禄同志家中的生活越来越困难。在抗日战争最艰苦的年代里，他的父亲走投无路，被逼上吊自杀。日伪统治时期，焦裕禄同志曾多次被日寇抓去毒打、坐牢，后又被押送到抚顺煤矿当苦工。焦裕禄同志忍受不了日寇的残害，于一九四三年秋天逃出虎口，回到家中。因无法生活下去，又逃到江苏省宿迁县，给一家姓胡的地主扛了两年长工。
    一九四五年抗日战争胜利后，焦裕禄同志从宿迁县回到了自己的家乡。当时他的家乡虽然还没有解放，但是，共产党已经在这里领导群众进行革命活动，焦裕禄同志自动要求当了民兵。在当民兵以后，他参加过解放博山县城的战斗。
    焦裕禄同志是一九四六年一月在本村参加中国共产党的。不久，他又正式参加了本县区武装部的工作，在当地领导民兵，坚持游击战争。解放战争时期，他带领民兵参加过不少战斗，以后又调到山东渤海地区参加过土地改革复查工作队，担任过组长。
    解放战争后期，焦裕禄同志随军离开了山东，到了河南，被分配到尉氏县工作，一直到一九五一年；先后担任过副区长、区长、中共区委副书记、青年团县委副书记等职。而后被先后调到青年团陈留地委工作和青年团郑州地委工作，担任过团地委宣传部长、第二副书记等职。
    一九五三年六月焦裕禄同志响应党的号召，被调到洛阳矿山机器制造厂参加工业建设，直到一九六二年，他在这个工厂担任过车间主任、科长。在这期间，焦裕禄同志还到大连起重机厂实习了一年多。一九六二年六月，为了加强农村工作，焦裕禄同志又被调回尉氏县，任县委书记处书记。一九六二年十二月焦裕禄同志被调到兰考县，任县委第二书记、书记。
    一九六四年五月十四日，焦裕禄同志不幸逝世。时年四十二岁。
    焦裕禄同志参加革命十八年间，一贯听党和毛主席的话，忠心耿耿，为无产阶级革命事业奋斗一生。焦裕禄同志不愧为毛泽东同志的好学生，不愧为我国广大干部的好榜样。
