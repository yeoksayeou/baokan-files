　　British newspapers and news agencies comment
    Saying that although Castro may maintain "revolutionary propaganda," the "possibility of taking action is smaller than before"; saying that American officials are "pleased" about this; saying that Castro recognizes the "necessity of coexisting" with the United States

　　A Reuters report from Washington on February 6th said:
　　U.S. officials today declined to comment on Cuban Prime Minister Castro's attacks on China, although they are understood to privately view the split between Havana and Beijing with a degree of satisfaction.
    For a long time, Washington has held the view that economic support for the Cuban leader mainly comes from the Soviet Union, while he tends to favor Beijing's more active approach in supporting armed revolution.
    These officials said privately that it no longer seems necessary for Castro to lean ideologically towards Beijing.

    The Times published an editorial on February 7th entitled "China, Please Get Out," excerpts as follows:
    Fidel Castro's very strong attack on China is of great significance to Cuba itself, to other Latin American countries, and to world communism.
      The most obvious reason (for his attack) is that Cuba has decided to satisfy its stomach rather than its spirit. The Russians can supply things, while the Chinese cannot. As the Sino-Soviet split widens, making a choice becomes more necessary.
    Regardless of the reasons he took this action, other Latin American countries can breathe a little easier. Castro will likely maintain his revolutionary propaganda among his neighbors. However, the possibility of action following words is now smaller than before.

    The Daily Telegraph published an editorial on February 8th entitled "The Unshrewd Chinese," saying:
    Now Castro has delivered a very strong and lengthy attack speech, scolding the Chinese out of Cuba. In his speech, he compared the Chinese to the Americans, accusing them of various acts of betrayal. The so-called reduction in rice deliveries is only part of the quarrel. The real substance of this accusation is that China interfered in Cuba's internal affairs by conducting anti-Soviet propaganda among the armed forces and officials.
    After properly weighing the pressure that Russia has undoubtedly exerted on Castro, the setback suffered by the Chinese is mainly due to their own clumsy means of dealing with others. In the West, China's setback in Cuba may cause some satisfaction.

    A Reuters report from Havana on February 8th said:
    After Prime Minister Castro's fierce attack on Beijing as "an imperialist country," foreign observers here speculate that Cuba and China may sever diplomatic relations.
    They say that, in terms of the intensity of Castro's statement on Sunday accusing China of attempting to subvert the Cuban armed forces, it is difficult to find a precedent in relations between socialist countries.

    The weekly Forum published an editorial on February 11th entitled "China, Cuba, and Coexistence," saying:
    Fidel Castro's fierce attack on China made the headlines of newspapers last weekend.
    Castro knows that, being only ninety nautical miles from Florida, the necessity of coexistence... is fundamental. The Cubans were once on the edge of the abyss that a nuclear confrontation would cause. They learned their lesson, and China still has to learn this lesson.

### 英国报刊和通讯社的评论

专栏：

　　英国报刊和通讯社的评论
    说卡斯特罗虽然可能保持“革命宣传”，但采取“行动的可能性比以前小了”；说美国官员对此感到“高兴”；说卡斯特罗认识到同美国“共处的必要性”
　　路透社二月六日从华盛顿发出的报道说：
　　美国官员今天拒绝就古巴总理卡斯特罗对中国的攻击发表意见，虽然据了解他们私下是怀着某种程度的高兴心情来看待哈瓦那和北京的分裂的。
    长期来，华盛顿有一种看法，认为对这位古巴领导人的经济支持主要来自苏联，而他则倾向于赞成北京在支持武装革命方面采取的更为积极的方针。
    这些官员私下说，对卡斯特罗说来，现在似乎已不再有必要在意识形态方面靠向北京。
    《泰晤士报》二月七日发表一篇社论，标题是《请中国滚蛋》，摘要如下：
    菲德尔·卡斯特罗十分猛烈地攻击中国对古巴本身、对其它拉丁美洲国家和对世界共产主义都有重大意义。
      （他进行这种攻击的）最明显的原因是，古巴已经决定满足肚皮而不要满足精神了。俄国人能供应东西，而中国人不能。随着中苏分歧的扩大，作出选择变得更加必要了。
    不管他采取这个行动的原因何在，其它拉丁美洲国家呼吸起来可以轻松一些了，卡斯特罗很可能在他的邻国中保持他的鼓吹革命宣传。但是，现在言语之后继之以行动的可能性比以前小了。
    《每日电讯报》二月八日发表题为《不精明的中国人》的社论说：
    现在卡斯特罗发表了十分厉害的长篇攻击演说，把中国人骂出了古巴。他在演说中把中国人同美国人相提并论，指责他们干了各种各样背信弃义的事。所谓大米交货量减少只是争吵的一部分。这一指责的真正实质部分是中国在武装部队和官员中间进行反苏宣传从而干涉了古巴内政。
    在适当衡量俄国无疑已经对卡斯特罗施加的压力后，中国人遭受这一挫折，主要是由于他们自己同别人打交道时手段笨拙。在西方，中国在古巴的挫折可能引起某种满意的情绪。
    路透社二月八日从哈瓦那发出的报道说：
    在卡斯特罗总理激烈攻击北京是“一个帝国主义国家”后，这里的外交观察家猜测古巴和中国之间可能断绝外交关系。
    他们说，就卡斯特罗星期日指责中国企图颠覆古巴武装部队的声明的激烈程度来说，在社会主义国家之间的关系中很难找到先例。
    《论坛》周刊二月十一日发表一篇题为《中国、古巴和共处》的社论说：
    菲德尔·卡斯特罗对中国的猛烈攻击成了上周末的报纸大标题。
    卡斯特罗知道，由于离佛罗里达只有九十海里，共处的必要性……是根本性的。古巴人曾经处在一场核交锋会造成的深渊的边缘。他们接受了教训，而中国还得接受这个教训。
