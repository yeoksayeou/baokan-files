    According to Xinhua News Agency, February 18th, People's Liberation Army cadres at all levels, especially those at the regimental level and above, are widely employing the spirit and methods of rectification in the campaign to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu. By comparing themselves to Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, they are identifying shortcomings and digging up root causes, using the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to target their own ideological realities, further promoting ideological revolutionization and work revolutionization.
    After the publication of Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds, the General Political Department immediately issued a notice to the entire army, and the leading organs of various services and arms, as well as various units, successively issued decisions calling on their subordinate units to quickly launch a learning upsurge, pushing the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought to a new peak. During this period, the Shenyang, Beijing, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Lanzhou, Chengdu, and Jinan Military Regions, and the Inner Mongolia Military District, in order to implement the spirit of the All-Army Political Work Conference, are holding expanded party committee meetings and meetings of cadres at the regimental level and above. At these meetings, they have included the study of Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds on the agenda, studying and discussing them repeatedly, using Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror to examine their thinking, summarize their work, and arrange their future tasks. In their studies, the Navy, Air Force, Artillery Corps, Engineering Corps, Armored Corps, and Public Security Forces, had many veteran cadres who had experienced the 25,000-li Long March and young cadres alike, who excitedly compared themselves to Jiao Yulu and learned from him. Navy Deputy Political Commissar Du Yide and Deputy Commander Zhao Qimin repeatedly emphasized at a study seminar that learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu requires continuing to give prominence to politics, making great efforts in the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthening self-revolution, and fighting a good ideological battle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology.
    What should be learned first?
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's advanced deeds are manifested in all aspects, and there are many things to learn. What should be learned first? Many cadres at the regimental level and above in various units unanimously believe that the most important thing is to learn his revolutionary ideology and transform the subjective world; only by transforming the subjective world can we better transform the objective world. In their studies, they have universally employed the spirit of rectification, carried out criticism and self-criticism, and conscientiously examined themselves in comparison to Jiao Yulu. In the "Think about Jiao Yulu, Look at Yourself" campaign, cadres at the regimental level and above in troops stationed in Guangxi consciously compared themselves to Jiao Yulu's position of wholeheartedly and thoroughly serving the people, and his consciousness of transforming his thinking. They said: The biggest difference lies in the fact that he had all the people in his heart, with no "I" in it, while they still have some selfish and impure thoughts. Wang Wufeng, director of the logistics department of a certain unit of the Public Security Forces, was over fifty years old and had the idea that he was old, his health was failing, and he would soon be transferred to civilian work. He examined himself in comparison to Jiao Yulu and said that the biggest gap between him and Comrade Jiao Yulu was his mental state. Jiao Yulu never forgot the cause of the Party and the people, while he sometimes thought about comfort and could not always remember that two-thirds of the world's class brothers and sisters had not yet been liberated.
    How to go a step further?
    After identifying the gaps, how to go a step further? The approach of many units in the Kunming and Fuzhou Military Regions is to continue to use the spirit of rectification to trace the roots of thought and dig up the sources of thought. They said: Finding the gaps is only the beginning of understanding oneself. To solve the problem, one must dare to "see blood with a bayonet" in thought, and boldly use the knife on the "I" without fear of ugliness or pain. Many veteran cadres who fought north and south in the revolutionary war years and made meritorious contributions revealed their true ideological situation to the masses with a high degree of revolutionary consciousness at various meetings, and found the obstacles hindering their progress. Lu Xiqin, a national combat hero and political commissar of a certain regiment of the Shenyang Military Region, after finding the gap between himself and Jiao Yulu in dealing with difficulties, profoundly examined himself in digging up the root causes. He said: "Only by loving the people more deeply can one tread on difficulties more deeply; the deeper the love for the people, the greater the power to overcome difficulties." At the four-level cadre meeting held in the Wuhan Military Region, Li Zhongshun, political commissar of a certain division, said after examining his own thinking: "A person entangled in selfish and impure thoughts can never do great things for the revolution. Only by being selfless can one generate fearlessness. By abandoning the 'I', one will rise to a new ideological realm, daring to venture into mountains of knives and seas of fire, and charging through forests of guns and rains of bullets." Through study, a large number of leading cadres deeply realized that in order to learn Comrade Jiao Yulu's idea of wholeheartedly serving the revolution, they must use the spirit of rectification, use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and confront their non-proletarian ideas. They said that this study was fruitful and rewarding, and was a profound ideological revolution.
    Where should learning be implemented?
    Where should the results of learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu be implemented? Many units believe that it should first be implemented in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, launching a larger-scale upsurge of "reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being good soldiers of Chairman Mao." Some have repeatedly examined their study plans in light of Jiao Yulu's deeds; others have found their own shortcomings based on Jiao Yulu's spirit of making great efforts in the "application" of studying Chairman Mao's works. When the members of the party committee of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region studied Jiao Yulu's deeds of wholeheartedly serving the revolution, they examined themselves and found that their study of "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune" was not as good as the soldiers, that they usually asked their subordinates to study more, and they studied less themselves. They resolved to take Jiao Yulu as an example, take the lead in studying, take the lead in transforming themselves, and strictly carry out self-ideological revolution. The cadres of the "Linfen Brigade" of a certain unit of the Nanjing Military Region, while studying Jiao Yulu's deeds, also repeatedly studied Comrade Lin Biao's five principles of giving prominence to politics, re-ordered their plans for studying Chairman Mao's works, and resolved to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu and make the study of Mao Zedong Thought a lifelong combat mission.

    解放军各级领导干部用整风精神学焦裕禄
    决心打好兴无灭资思想仗
    把学习落实到活学活用毛主席著作上
    据新华社十八日讯　人民解放军各级领导干部，特别是团以上干部，在向焦裕禄同志学习的活动中，广泛运用整风精神，采用整风方法，对照焦裕禄同志的事迹，找差距，挖根源，用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射自己的思想实际之“的”，进一步促进了思想革命化和工作革命化。
    焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹发表以后，总政治部立即向全军发出学习通知，各军种兵种，各部队领导机关都相继作出决定，号召所属部队迅速掀起学习热潮，把活学活用毛主席著作推向新的高峰。这期间，沈阳、北京、南京、广州、武汉、兰州、成都、济南部队和内蒙古军区等，为贯彻全军政治工作会议精神，正在举行党委扩大会和团以上干部会。会上，都把学习焦裕禄同志的事迹列入日程，反复学，反复议，以焦裕禄同志作为镜子，检查思想，总结工作，安排今后的任务。海军、空军、炮兵、工程兵、装甲兵、公安部队在学习中，有许多经历过二万五千里长征的老干部和青年干部一样，激动地同焦裕禄比，向焦裕禄学。海军副政委杜义德、副司令员赵启民在一次学习座谈会上，反复强调学习焦裕禄同志就要继续突出政治，在活学活用毛主席著作上狠下功夫，加强自我革命，打好兴无产阶级思想、灭资产阶级思想的思想仗。
    首先应该学什么？
    焦裕禄同志的先进事迹表现在各个方面，要学的东西很多，首先应该学什么？许多部队团以上干部一致认为：最重要的是学习他的革命化的思想，改造主观世界；只有改造好主观世界，才能更好地改造客观世界。他们在学习时，普遍运用整风的精神，开展批评与自我批评，对照焦裕禄认真检查自己。驻广西部队团以上干部在“想想焦裕禄，看看自己”的活动中，许多人都自觉地与焦裕禄同志比完全、彻底为人民服务的立场，比改造思想的自觉性。他们说：千差万差，最根本的差在他心里装着全体人民，唯独没有“我”字，而自己还有某些私心杂念。公安部队某部后勤处长王舞凤，年过五十，有年大体差、快要转业了的想法。他对照焦裕禄检查说，自己与焦裕禄同志差距最大的是精神状态，焦裕禄时刻不忘党和人民的事业，自己有时还想安逸，不能时时刻刻都想到世界上还有三分之二的阶级兄弟没有解放。
    怎样再深入一步？
    找出差距以后，再怎样深入一步？昆明、福州等部队许多单位做法是：继续用整风的精神，追思想上的根，挖思想上的源。他们说：找出差距只是认识自己的开始，要解决问题，还必须在思想上敢于“刺刀见红”，不怕丑、不怕痛地大胆向“我”字开刀。许多在革命战争年代南征北战、创立过功勋的老干部，在各种会议上，以高度的革命自觉，向群众“亮”出自己真实的思想情况，找出妨碍自己进步的障碍。全国战斗英雄、沈阳部队某团政委卢锡芹，在找出自己对待困难不如焦裕禄的差距后，在挖根究源中深刻地检查了自己。他说：“只有对人民爱得越深，才能对困难踩得越深；对人民的热爱深一分，克服困难的力量就大一分。”在武汉部队举行的四级干部会上，某师政委李忠顺在检查了自己的思想后说：“一个被私心杂念所纠缠的人，决不可能为革命干出大事业来的，只有无私，才能产生无畏，丢掉‘我’字，就会上升到新的思想境界，刀山火海也敢闯，枪林弹雨也敢冲。”通过学习，大批领导干部深深地体会到：要把焦裕禄同志一心为革命的思想学到手，必须用整风的精神，用批评与自我批评的武器，同自己的非无产阶级思想交锋。他们说，这次学习收获大，成果好，是一次深刻的思想革命。
    学习落实到哪里？
    把学习焦裕禄同志的成果落实到哪里？许多部队认为首先要落实到活学活用毛主席著作上，掀起更大规模的“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”的热潮。他们有的对照着焦裕禄的事迹，反复检查了学习计划；有的以焦裕禄学毛主席著作在“用”字上狠下功夫的精神，找出了自己的不足。广州部队某部党委成员学习焦裕禄一心为革命的事迹时，对照检查了自己学习《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》等不如战士，平时要下级学得多，自己学得少，决心以焦裕禄为榜样，带头学习，带头改造自己，严格进行自我思想革命。南京部队某部“临汾旅”的干部，在学习焦裕禄事迹的同时，又反复学习了林彪同志关于突出政治的五项原则，重新订了学习毛主席著作的计划，决心象焦裕禄同志那样，把学习毛泽东思想作为毕生的战斗任务。
