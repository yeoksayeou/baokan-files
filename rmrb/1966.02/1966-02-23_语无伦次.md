　　Incoherent
    U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler declared that the "best signs of achieving overall victory" had appeared in the war of aggression against Vietnam; but he then said that "the outcome is still uncertain" and "the situation is still not optimistic."
    Since there are already "the best signs of overall victory," yet the situation is "not optimistic," why is this American military leader contradicting himself to such an extent?
    Originally, Wheeler had more than once made himself a laughingstock in the past for boasting about the "victorious" prospects of the United States on the South Vietnamese battlefield. Having learned from experience, this time he knew it would be better to leave himself a way out when bragging. Therefore, he cannot help but be incoherent.

　　语无伦次
    美国参谋长联席会议主席惠勒宣称，在侵越战争中已经出现了美国“取得全面胜利的最好迹象”；但是他接着又说，“结局仍然未定”，“情况还是不乐观”。
    既然已有“全面胜利的最好迹象”，情况又“不乐观”，美国的这个军事头目说话为何自相矛盾至此呢？
    原来，惠勒过去因为吹嘘美国在南越战场上的“胜利”前景，已经不止一次地使自己大丢其丑。他有了经验，这次晓得吹牛还是留个退步好些。因此，他就不能不语无伦次了。
