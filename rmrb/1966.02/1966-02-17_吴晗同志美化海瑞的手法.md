    Wu Han's methods of glorifying Hai Rui
    Wen Qing
    Summary: Comrade Wu Han, violating the most basic scientific attitude, arbitrarily distorted historical materials and fabricated history in order to glorify Hai Rui. This article exposes several examples from his book "The Story of Hai Rui."
    In "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and a series of historical essays, Comrade Wu Han spared no effort to glorify Hai Rui, portraying him as the "savior" of the people, demanding that people prostrate themselves before him. This is truly absurd! One of the important methods Comrade Wu Han used to beautify Hai Rui was to fabricate history and distort historical materials. This article only exposes a few examples from his book "The Story of Hai Rui."
    First, he changed "ordering the old servant to grow vegetables for self-sufficiency" to Hai Rui "growing vegetables himself." Hai Rui's biographies and epitaphs all record that when Hai Rui was the magistrate of Chun'an, "there was vacant land in the official residence, he instructed the old servant to plant rice and wheat, and vegetables and mustard, and took them for his own sustenance morning and evening." The "History of Ming - Biography of Hai Rui" also records that Hai Rui "ordered the old servant to grow vegetables for self-sufficiency." These records all clearly state that Hai Rui "instructed" or "ordered" his servant to plant crops and vegetables in the yamen and take them for self-sufficiency. However, Comrade Wu Han brazenly altered it to "growing vegetables himself." Not only that, "The Story of Hai Rui" also included an illustration of Hai Rui watering vegetables himself. This is truly a shocking fabrication.
    Second, he promoted untrustworthy "rumors" as true events. Comrade Wu Han vigorously publicized that "the news that Magistrate Hai had taken action against the son of the governor-general caused a sensation in Chun'an and spread throughout the southeast. The common people were all delighted, and the sons of nobles and bureaucrats all had headaches." According to Comrade Wu Han's description, the content of this "news" was: The son of Governor-General Hu Zongxian passed through Chun'an, acting arrogantly and abusively. He was unhappy with the yamen official's "inadequate supply and service, threw a tantrum, and ordered his followers to tie up the yamen official and hang him upside down on a tree." Hai Rui then took action against him and confiscated "several thousand taels of silver from his boxes and handed it over to the national treasury." Hai Rui also wrote a letter to Hu Zongxian, "Hu Zongxian read it and was so angry he couldn't speak. Fearing that Hai Rui would really make a big deal out of it, and knowing that he was in the wrong, he had to let it go and didn't dare to make a sound."
    Is this "news" true? No. The so-called "sensation in Chun'an, spread throughout the southeast" was actually unknown even to the people of Chun'an. Huang Bingshi, who personally went to Chun'an at the time and wrote a biography for Hai Rui, analyzed this rumor, saying: "I once heard people talk about Magistrate Hai's affairs, saying: Governor-General Hu's son passed through Chun'an and was angry that the supply was inadequate, and whipped the yamen attendant. The magistrate (Hai Rui) imprisoned the governor-general's son, preventing him from leaving, and wrote a document to ask for instructions from Hu." "However, there is no post station in Chun'an. When asked the people of Chun'an, they have never heard of this matter." Therefore, he concluded: "In general, all good things are attributed to him. The things I have heard about Magistrate Hai (Hai Rui) that are contrary to the situation are mostly of this kind, but I don’t know that they are not the true Magistrate Hai (Hai Rui)." He also said: "I also remember that when Magistrate Hai (Hai Rui) was magistrate, there was a grand censor who passed through the county and had the stolen goods in his box confiscated, which moved the world at the time. I think it was just a rumor and an occasional difference." This shows that the "news" promoted by Comrade Wu Han is only a synthesis of various rumors.
    Third, he misinterpreted Hai Rui's desire for the emperor to "discuss the interests and harms of the world" as wanting the emperor to "seek some benefits for the people." Comrade Wu Han said that Hai Rui taught Jiajing in the "Security Proposal": "You must know that cultivating Daoism has no benefits. You should wake up immediately, go to court every day, study national affairs and people's livelihoods, and correct decades of mistakes to seek some benefits for the people." In fact, the purpose of Hai Rui's "Security Proposal" was only to "correct the emperor's way, clarify the ministers' duties, and seek eternal peace and order." Please see the original text: "If Your Majesty truly knows that profound cultivation is useless, and if I change my behavior, the people will emulate me, and the unrest and misgovernment of the world will be caused by this. If you repent and wake up, go to the morning court every day, and discuss the interests and harms of the world with the grand councilors, the nine ministers, the attendants, and the censors, to wash away the mistakes of the emperor's way for decades." The so-called "discuss the interests and harms of the world" is precisely to study how to strengthen the feudal rule. Where is there any intention to ask Jiajing to "seek some benefits for the people"?
    Fourth, he fabricated the image of bureaucratic landlords as poor people who were "often not full" and "starving." Hai Rui lived a leisurely life of a landlord class for more than ten years after being dismissed from office. Comrade Wu Han, however, portrayed him as a poor man who was "often not full" and "starving." He said that "Hai Rui never added any fields except for the more than ten mu of ancestral fields." He also said that Hai Rui's "family's food and expenses all came from these ten mu of ancestral fields, and they were often not full. When young men from the same village came to discuss scholarship and lecture on scriptures, they were so hungry that they had to press their stomachs with their hands while still talking. After the guests left, they talked and saw them off, not letting them know that they were starving."
    Did Hai Rui "never add any fields himself"? Wrong. According to the "Chronicle of Hai Zhongjie" alone, Hai Rui personally used "one hundred and twenty gold" from his "clear salary savings" to "buy the first district." When his mother died, the bureaucrat and landlord Chen Fusheng "donated funeral expenses," and he personally "bought several mu of tomb fields." Can't this be considered land that Hai Rui added himself?
    Was Hai Rui's family "often not full"? This is also a fabrication. Hai Rui always lived the life of a bureaucrat and landlord. You see that he married several concubines. It is said that he "married nine times and changed his wife at home" ("Miscellaneous Records of the Wanli Reign"), or it is said that he "married six or seven times," at least "married only three and chose carefully, then changed to a concubine" ("Epitaph of Hai Zhongjie"). When he died, he still had "two concubines and four servants serving him" ("Chronicle of Hai Zhongjie"). He "did not skimp on buying books with gold" at home. His "small garden west of the study was ordered to be cultivated by two or three children." Although he "usually did not prepare wine and delicacies, but only vegetables and rice with a cup of tea, and talked with guests" ("Biography of Hai Zhongjie"), he also sometimes "set up chicken and millet to eat with guests" ("Chronicle of Hai Zhongjie"). He could even find some money "to help the poor of his clan, or help them with marriage, and sometimes reach out to the poor scholars of the county" ("Biography of Hai Zhongjie"). How could Hai Rui be so poor that he was "often not full"?
    The matter of Hai Rui "starving" mentioned by Comrade Wu Han is based on the record in "Epitaph of Hai Zhongjie." "(Hai Rui) stayed at home for more than ten years, lecturing on art and literature, and explaining the meaning of scriptures every day. When he was hungry and tired, he would support his abdomen with his hands, and he would still speak tirelessly. Even when he sent guests out the door, he would still stand and talk for a long time." It means that during Hai Rui's time at home, he received fellow villagers every day to talk about art, literature, and the meaning of scriptures. When he was hungry and tired from speaking, he would support his abdomen with his hands, and he would still speak tirelessly. Finally, he would send the guests out the door and still stand and talk for a long time, without knowing fatigue. Comrade Wu Han insisted on interpreting this as Hai Rui "starving" and "not letting people know he was starving," which is truly wishful thinking!
    Comrade Wu Han is a historian. However, in order to glorify Hai Rui, he arbitrarily tampered with historical materials and violated the most basic scientific attitude. What is hidden in his bones?

    吴晗同志美化海瑞的手法
    问青
    提要　吴晗同志违反最起码的科学态度，为了美化海瑞，不惜任意歪曲史料，伪造历史。本文从他的《海瑞的故事》一书揭发几件事例。
    吴晗同志在《海瑞罢官》和一系列历史论文中，对海瑞极尽美化之能事，把他说成是人民的“救星”，让人们对他顶礼膜拜，真是荒谬！吴晗同志美化海瑞的重要手法之一，就是伪造历史，歪曲史料。本文仅从他的《海瑞的故事》一书揭发几件事例。
    其一、把“令老仆艺蔬自给”，竟改为海瑞“自己种菜”。海瑞的传记、行状等都记载海瑞任淳安知县时，“官署中有隙地，课老仆树禾麦、艺蔬芥，旦夕取自赡”。《明史·海瑞传》也记载有海瑞“令老仆艺蔬自给”。这些记载都明明说海瑞是“课”或“令”他的仆人在衙门里种庄稼和蔬菜，取以自赡。但是，吴晗同志却明目张胆地把它篡改为“自己种菜”。不仅如此，《海瑞的故事》中还附有一幅海瑞亲自浇菜的插图，这真是惊人的捏造。
    其二、把不可信的“传闻”，当作真事来宣扬。吴晗同志大肆宣扬“海知县拿办总督公子的新闻轰动了淳安，传遍了东南，老百姓人人称快，贵族官僚子弟个个头痛”。按照吴晗同志的介绍，这件“新闻”的内容是：总督胡宗宪的儿子经过淳安，作威作福，嫌驿吏“供应不周到，大发脾气，喝令跟人把驿吏捆了，倒挂在树上”。海瑞就把他拿办了，把他“箱子里的几千两银子都充了公，交给国库”。海瑞还写信给胡宗宪，“胡宗宪看了，气得说不出话，怕海瑞真个把事情闹大，自己理屈，只好算了，竟不敢声张”。
    这件“新闻”是真的吗？不是。所谓它“轰动了淳安，传遍了东南”，实际上是连淳安人也不知道。当时亲自到过淳安并为海瑞写传的黄秉石曾对这一传闻作过分析，他说：“予尝闻人言海令事，曰：胡总制公子过淳安，怒其供应不备，鞭驿丞。公（海瑞）囚公子，使不得去，为文以请于胡。”“然淳无驿也，问之淳人，亦绝不闻此事”。因此他得出结论说：“盖天下之善归焉，所闻公（海瑞）事之戾于情者，大约此类，而不知其非公（海瑞）之真也。”他还说：“又记公（海瑞）为令时，有都御史过县而发其箧中赃，刚正动一时，想亦传闻偶异耳。”这就说明，吴晗同志所宣扬的这件“新闻”，只不过是各种传闻的综合而已。
    其三、把海瑞要皇帝“讲求天下利害”，曲解为要皇帝“为人民谋些福利”。吴晗同志说海瑞在《治安疏》中教训嘉靖：“你要知道，修道没有什么好处，应该立即醒悟过来，每天上朝，研究国计民生，痛改几十年的错误，为人民谋些福利。”其实，海瑞上《治安疏》的目的，只是“正君道，明臣职，求万世治安”。请看原文：“陛下诚知玄修无益，臣之改行，民之效尤，天下之不安不治由之，翻然悔悟，日视正朝，与宰辅、九卿、侍从、言官讲求天下利害，洗数十年君道之误。”所谓“讲求天下利害”，正是研究如何加强封建统治的办法，哪里有什么要嘉靖“为人民谋些福利”的意思呢？
    其四、把官僚地主伪造为“时常吃不饱”和“挨饿”的穷人。海瑞罢官家居十多年，过的是地主阶级的悠闲生活。吴晗同志却把他描绘成一个“时常吃不饱”和“挨饿”的穷人。他说“海瑞一生除有祖田十余亩外，自己没有添置过田产”。又说海瑞“一家吃用都从这祖传的十亩田里出，时常吃不饱。同乡青年来谈学问，讲经义，实在饿很了，只好用手按着肚子，一面还谈着话，客人走了，边谈边送，不让人知道他挨饿”。
    海瑞“自己没有添置过田产”吗？不对。仅根据《海忠介公年谱》记述，海瑞就用过“清俸所存”中的“一百二十金”亲自“买第一区”。他母亲死了，官僚地主陈复升“捐助赙金”，他亲自“为置墓田数亩”。这难道不能算海瑞自己添置过的田产吗？
    海瑞一家“时常吃不饱”吗？这也是捏造。海瑞一直过的是官僚地主生活。你看他娶过好多个妻妾，相传他“居家九娶而易其妻”（《万历野获编》），或传他“六娶七娶”，至少是“娶惟三而慎选，辄易则侧室”（《海忠介公行状》）。他临死时还有“二媵四仆奉侍”（《海忠介公年谱》）。他在家“不吝金购书”。他的“斋西小圃命二三童艺瓜蔬”。他虽然“居常不治酒肴，或蔬饭杯茗，与客对谈而已”（《海忠介公传》），但也有时与客人“设鸡黍相对食”（《海忠介公年谱》）。甚至还能弄些钱“以周族之贫者，或助之婚嫁，而时及于邑之贫士”（《海忠介公传》）。海瑞哪里有穷得“时常吃不饱”的事？
    吴晗同志所说的海瑞“挨饿”一事，是根据《海忠介公行状》中的记载。“（海瑞）家居十余年，日为课艺文，说经义，或馁困，时以手撑腹，言无倦厌，即相送出门，犹立谈移晷也”。意思是说海瑞家居时期，每天好接待同乡讲说艺文、经义，讲饿了困了，就用手撑住腹部，还是言无倦厌。最后送客出门，还站着谈论很久，不知疲倦。吴晗同志硬把这解释成海瑞“挨饿”并“不让人知道他挨饿”，真是想当然！
    吴晗同志是一个历史家。但是，为了美化海瑞，他竟如此任意篡改史料，违反最起码的科学态度，骨子里藏的什么呢？
