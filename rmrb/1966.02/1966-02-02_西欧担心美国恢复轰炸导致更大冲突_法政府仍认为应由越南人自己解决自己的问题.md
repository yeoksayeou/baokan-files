    (Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch) Western European public opinion believes that Johnson's order to resume bombing of North Vietnam marks the bankruptcy of the US "peace offensive." They are also worried that this US action will lead to a further expansion of the Vietnam War.

    According to UPI, a spokesman for French President De Gaulle said that De Gaulle was deeply disturbed by the US decision. He has always been concerned that the Vietnam War would gradually evolve into a larger conflict.

    AFP reported that the French public believes that the resumption of bombing marks the failure of the US "peace offensive." The news agency said: "In fact, people have never believed that the US government's propaganda to foreign capitals would succeed. The purpose of this propaganda by the US government is to create conditions for negotiations, so that the world and American public opinion will believe that the United States is primarily seeking to hold negotiations to end the conflict."

    The news agency said: "The French government today still believes, as it did when it issued a statement in August 1963, that this conflict can only be resolved when the Vietnamese themselves solve their domestic problems without any foreign intervention."

    A Kyodo News dispatch from Paris said that the US resumption of bombing of North Vietnam "increased France's anxiety." France is worried that this could lead to a military conflict with China and the danger of an unlimited expansion of the war.

    The British *Guardian* is concerned that the US resumption of bombing of North Vietnam will expand the war.

    The newspaper said that Johnson should not be surprised by the failure of his "peace offensive." If he is surprised, it is because he does not yet understand that this war is a "war to expel foreigners."

    Norway's *Dagbladet* is concerned that the US resumption of bombing of North Vietnam can only increase hatred and expand the conflict.

    西欧担心美国恢复轰炸导致更大冲突
    法政府仍认为应由越南人自己解决自己的问题
    据新华社一日讯　西欧各国舆论认为，约翰逊下令恢复轰炸越南北方的行动标志着美国“和平攻势”的破产，它们还担心，美国这个行动会导致越南战争的进一步扩大。
    据合众国际社透露，法国总统戴高乐的一位发言人说，戴高乐对美国的决定感到严重不安。他一向担心，越南战争会逐步演变为一场更大的冲突。
    法新社报道，法国公众认为，恢复轰炸标志着美国“和平攻势”的失败。这家通讯社说：“事实上，人们从未相信过美国政府对外国首都进行的宣传会取得成功，美国政府这种宣传的目的在于创造谈判的条件，使全世界和美国舆论相信，美国首先寻求的是举行谈判结束冲突。”
    通讯社说：“法国政府今天仍然象它在一九六三年八月间发表声明时那样认为，只有在越南人自己解决他们的国内问题而没有任何外国干预时，这一冲突才能解决。”
    共同社的一则巴黎消息说，美国恢复轰炸越南北方“给法国增加了忧虑”，法国担心，这会导致同中国的军事冲突，并且导致战争无限扩大的危险。
    英国的《卫报》担心美国恢复轰炸越南北方会使战争扩大。
    报纸说，约翰逊对他的“和平攻势”失败不应该感到意外。如果他感到意外，那是因为他还不了解这场战争是一场“驱逐外国人的战争”。
    挪威的《日报》担心，美国恢复对北越的轰炸只能增加仇恨和使冲突扩大。
