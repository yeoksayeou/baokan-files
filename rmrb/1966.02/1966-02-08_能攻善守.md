    The South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces shelled the American military's Phu Loi Airport, achieving a brilliant victory by wiping out more than 300 American invading soldiers and destroying 52 American aircraft. This is another great victory won by the South Vietnamese people since the beginning of the spring.
    Phu Loi Airport is the base of the American "ace" First Infantry Division, only thirty-odd kilometers away from the den of the American puppets. Moreover, after the Bien Hoa, Soc Trang, An Tan, and Nha Trang airports were attacked last year, the American invaders strengthened the defense of various strongholds. However, it was still raided by the elusive South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces. In the great victory of shelling Phu Loi Airport, the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces demonstrated their increasingly strong ability to attack enemy strongholds, as well as their resourcefulness, bravery, and the rapid improvement of their combat skills.
    Recently, under the cover of a "peace" smokescreen, the American invaders have stepped up reinforcements to South Vietnam, attempting to reverse their passive situation and prepare for further expansion of the war. They plan to consolidate their current strongholds on the one hand, and launch large-scale "sweeps" on the other, to nibble away at the liberated areas and eliminate the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces. Since the Spring Festival, the American invaders have made some attempts. They mobilized tens of thousands of troops to launch the so-called "Five-pronged Offensive." As a result, each prong ran into a wall one after another. At the same time, their base was attacked by the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces. This shows that although the American invaders have increased their troops and changed their strategy, they cannot change their passive situation of being unable to parry or retaliate. The South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces, on the other hand, are getting stronger and stronger in battle, and can inflict heavy blows on the enemy whether attacking or defending. From some recent developments in the South Vietnamese war situation, people can see more clearly the prospect of the Vietnamese people's inevitable victory and the American imperialism's inevitable defeat.

    能攻善守
    南越人民武装力量炮轰美军的富利机场，获得了歼灭美国侵略军三百多人、击毁美国飞机五十二架的辉煌战果。这是南越人民开春以来所取得的又一巨大胜利。
    富利机场是美国“王牌军”第一步兵师的基地，离美伪的巢穴只有三十来公里之遥。而且在边和、朔庄、安新、芽庄等机场去年被袭击之后，美国侵略者加强了各个据点的守卫。但是，它还是照样遭到神出鬼没的南越人民武装力量的奇袭。在炮轰富利机场的大捷中，南越人民武装显示了它进攻敌人据点的日益增强的力量，也表现了他们的机智、勇敢精神和作战技术的迅速提高。
    最近，美国侵略者在“和平”烟幕掩盖下，加紧增兵南越，企图扭转它被动挨打的局面，并作好进一步扩大战争的准备。它打算一方面巩固现在的据点，同时展开大规模“扫荡”，蚕食解放区，消灭南越人民武装力量。春节以来，美国侵略者已作了一些尝试。它调动数万的兵力发动了所谓“五路攻势”。结果是，一路一路都先后碰了壁。同时，它的基地却受到南越人民武装的攻击。这表明，美国侵略者尽管增加了兵力，变换了战略，也改变不了它既无招架之功、又无还手之力的被动处境。而南越人民武装力量则越战越强，不论是攻是守，都能够给予敌人以沉重的打击。从最近南越战局的一些发展中，人们更加看清楚越南人民必胜、美帝国主义必败的前景。
