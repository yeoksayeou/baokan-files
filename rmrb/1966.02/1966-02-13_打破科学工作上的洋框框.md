    Metaphysics is a rope that binds the development of science. Natural science research, like social science research, is guided either by dialectical materialism or by metaphysics and idealism. To rapidly develop science in our country, the most important and fundamental thing is to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide scientific research work, and to take Chairman Mao's books as the highest instruction for scientific research work.

    So-called "modern science" has only a few decades of history in our country. Our own foundation in this area is very weak. Before liberation, everything was imported from capitalist countries. Now, most of the older generation of scientific workers in the country directly learned their scientific knowledge from capitalist countries, so their ideological viewpoints and working methods are also within the system of capitalist countries' scientific workers. Young scientific workers learn from the older generation, and they are also more or less affected by this influence. At the same time, because they learn from and imitate foreign countries, they worship and are superstitious about foreign countries, thus creating a sense of inferiority. As the People's Daily editorial said: This spiritual shackle left over from history has become a habit, binding our intelligence and creativity.

    With the above-mentioned inferiority complex and ideological constraints, most of the work can only be carried out by groping behind others, daring not to boldly imagine or create. They look for problems that can be continued or expanded in the work that others have done, and make some revisions and provide some supplementary information. This is the so-called "coming from the literature, going to the literature" working method. By doing this, some small achievements can generally be made, but it is difficult to achieve great achievements. Because the bones found in the leftovers of others will not have much meat to gnaw on.

    The attitude towards a certain theory or a certain school of thought often tends to be blindly worshipped. After learning a certain theory, one believes in it, regards it as a dogma, and studies it diligently within this framework. As a result, one often can only follow behind others, providing some supplementary materials, and cannot produce creative achievements.

    From the above-mentioned situation, in order to catch up with or surpass the international level on the scientific front: first, we must eliminate our sense of inferiority and establish the spirit that if others can do it, we can also do it, and if others have not done it, we must also do it; second, we must free ourselves from the shackles of the old academic system in our thinking, so that our thinking can be unrestrained and we can roam freely in the vast scientific field. In this way, our work will greatly advance and it will be possible to walk in front of the world.

    In the past, I was greatly influenced by metaphysics, especially mechanical materialism. For example, on issues of heredity or development, I often emphasized one aspect while ignoring the other, or emphasized the role of parts while ignoring the overall relationship. Later, in my work, I gradually discovered that many phenomena in biology did not conform to the views of mechanical materialism, and at the same time, I felt that various facts could not be explained by theories such as neo-vitalism and organicism. And I myself did not have a clear concept that could explain the basic nature of the problem, so my views on certain issues were always confused and uncertain, and I just approached these issues with a skeptical attitude. Sometimes, because I couldn't explain the reasons, I echoed what others said and used the views of various schools to understand various natural phenomena.

    After liberation, studying Chairman Mao's works gave me a great inspiration. I began to realize that the phenomena in the biological world are completely in line with materialist dialectics. Only by analyzing biology with the viewpoints and methods of materialist dialectics can we truly explain biological phenomena, and only by studying biology with the viewpoints and methods of materialist dialectics can we truly understand the laws of biology. There are many questions that I suspected in the past and never dared to draw conclusions on, but now they have been resolved. For example, the relationship between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm is a fundamental issue in biology. Many influential and authoritative theories emphasize the role of the cell nucleus and ignore the function of the cytoplasm. However, in the work of individual development, there are many examples that illustrate the importance of the cytoplasm in the development process. It is not only not completely controlled by the cell nucleus, but it can also affect the cell nucleus. Even so, due to the power of old theories, I did not dare to directly and clearly raise this issue in the past. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I realized that the role or development of things is related to and influenced by other things around them. Therefore, we must look at problems from two sides, and we cannot absolutely and one-sidedly emphasize one aspect while ignoring the other. The same must be true of the view of the relationship between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. The cell nucleus and the cytoplasm should each have its own role and importance. This strengthened my confidence in my view of the cytoplasm, encouraged my courage to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, gave us an independent direction in our work, no longer crawling behind others, and made some progress.

    In addition, there are some problems that I could not understand in the past, but now I understand them. For example, what is the driving force of biological development (including evolution and development)? There are many idealistic and metaphysical explanations for this question, none of which can explain its basic root. After reading Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction," I quickly realized that contradiction is the driving force of biological development. Biological individuals have their own internal contradictions, there are contradictions between biological individuals, and there are contradictions between organisms and the natural environment. All these contradictions constantly exist, without a moment of stopping. The old contradictions are resolved, and new contradictions arise. It is precisely the contradiction that promotes the development of biology.

    Biology cannot survive without the environment, so the relationship or contradiction between organisms and the environment has become an important issue in biology. Some people emphasize the role of environmental conditions on biological changes or development, and such a view also confused me for a period of time. Now I also clearly realize that internal contradiction is the basis of biological change or development, and external factors are the conditions for biological change or development. Chairman Mao said: "The egg changes into a chicken because it gets a suitable temperature, but temperature cannot turn a stone into a chicken." This simple example solves a big problem in biology.

    The above are just a few examples to illustrate the changes in my views and thoughts on various issues after studying Chairman Mao's works. Of course, my study is very superficial, my understanding is also very shallow, my views on issues will not be very correct, and there will still be mistakes. But in any case, after studying, I deeply realized that to break the foreign framework of the metaphysical ideological system, we must arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought.

    The development of scientific research work is closely related to our ideological viewpoints and methods. History tells us that whenever the idealistic and metaphysical worldview rises, the development of science is hindered; when the dialectical materialist worldview develops, scientific work also develops rapidly. To make our country's science quickly catch up with and surpass the international level and make better and greater contributions to socialist construction, the most important link and the fastest way is to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide our work. Therefore, studying Chairman Mao's works and transforming our worldview has become the most urgent revolutionary task for our scientific workers at present.

    打破科学工作上的洋框框
    中国科学院生物学部主任　童第周
    形而上学，是束缚科学发展的绳索。而自然科学研究工作，同社会科学研究工作一样，其指导思想不是辩证唯物论，就是形而上学、唯心论。要迅速发展我国科学，最重要、最根本的是用毛泽东思想来指导科学研究工作，把毛主席的书作为科学研究工作的最高指示。
    所谓“现代科学”，在我国仅有几十年的历史。我们自己这方面基础很差，在解放以前，一切都从资本主义国家输入。现在国内年龄比较大的科学工作者，他们的科学知识，多数直接学自资本主义国家，所以他们的思想观点，工作方法，也和资本主义国家的科学工作者一个体系。年青的科学工作者跟年老的一辈学习，也或多或少受到这种影响。同时因为学外国，模仿外国，就崇拜外国，迷信外国，从而产生一种自卑的心理。正如人民日报社论所说的：这个历史上遗留下来的精神枷锁，成为一种习惯势力，束缚了我们的聪明才智和创造精神。
    有了上述的自卑心理，和思想上的束缚，因而，在工作上大都只能跟在人家后面摸索进行，不敢大胆设想，大胆创造，在别人做过的工作中，找一些可以继续或扩展的问题，作一些修正工作，提供一些补充资料。这就是所谓“从文献中来，到文献中去”的工作方法。这样做，一般可以做出一些小的成绩来，但很难有大的成就。因为从别人残羹剩肴中找来的骨头，不会有很多肉可啃的。
    对某一学说或某一学派的态度，往往也会盲目崇拜。学习某一学说以后，就信奉某一学说，把它视为圭臬，孜孜不倦地在这个框子内钻研，结果也往往只能跟在别人后面，提供一些修补资料，做不出有创造性的成绩来。
    从上面所说的情况来看，在科学战线上要赶上或超过国际水平：第一要消灭我们的自卑感，树立起人家能干，我们也能干，人家没有干，我们也要干的精神；第二要解脱思想上旧学术体系的束缚，使思想奔放，在广大的科学领域中，能驰骋自如。这样，我们的工作就会大大地前进一步，便有可能走在世界的前面。
    我过去受到形而上学，特别是机械唯物论的影响不少。例如对遗传或发育上的问题往往强调某一方面，忽视另一方面，或重视部分作用，忽视整体关系。以后在工作中逐渐发现生物上的许多现象，不符合于机械唯物论的观点，同时又觉得各种事实也非新生论、生机论等学说所能解释。而自己又没有一个明确的观念，可以说明问题的基本性质，所以对某些问题的看法，一直迷惑不定，只是抱着怀疑的态度，来对待这些问题。有时因自己说不出所以然，也就人云亦云，随着各派的观点，去理解各种自然现象。
    解放以后，学习毛主席著作，使我受到了一个很大的启发，开始认识到生物界的现象是完全合乎唯物辩证法的。只有以唯物辩证法的观点、方法去分析生物，才能真正说明生物的现象，也只有以唯物辩证法的观点、方法去研究生物，才能真正认识到生物的规律。有许多过去怀疑的问题，一直不敢作出结论，现在得到了解决。比如细胞核与细胞质的关系，这是生物学上一个根本性的问题，很多有影响的权威性学说，强调细胞核的作用，忽视细胞质的功能。但在个体发育的工作中，有不少事例说明细胞质在发育过程中的重要性。它不但不完全受细胞核的控制，而且还能影响细胞核。虽然如此，由于旧学说的威力，我在过去还不敢直接明确地提出这个问题来。学习毛主席著作以后，认识到事物的作用或发展，同它周围的其它事物都有相互联系和相互影响。因此，看问题必须一分为二，不能绝对地、片面地强调一方面，忽视另一方面。对细胞核和细胞质关系的看法，也必须如此。细胞核和细胞质都应当各有它的作用和重要性。这样便加强了我对细胞质看法的信心，鼓舞了我敢想、敢说、敢干的勇气，使我们在工作上有独立的方向，不再跟在别人后面爬行，并得到了一些发展。
    此外有一些问题是我过去所无法理解的，现在也理解了。比如，生物发展（包括进化和发育）的动力是什么？对这个问题有很多唯心的、形而上学的解释，都不能说明它的基本根源。读了毛主席的《矛盾论》以后，很快就使我觉悟到矛盾便是生物发展的动力。生物个体有它自己内部的矛盾，生物个体与个体之间有矛盾，生物与自然环境之间有矛盾。所有这些矛盾，都经常地存在着，没有一刻停止，旧的矛盾解决，新的矛盾产生。正是矛盾推动着生物的发展。
    生物不能离开环境而生存，因此生物与环境的关系或矛盾便成为生物学上一个重要问题。有人强调环境条件对生物变化或发展的作用，这样的看法，也使我在一个时期内感到迷惑。现在我也明确地认识到，内部矛盾是生物变化或发展的根据，外界因素是生物变化或发展的条件。毛主席说：“鸡蛋因得适当的温度而变化为鸡子，但温度不能使石头变为鸡子”。这个简明的例子，解决了生物学上的大问题。
    以上仅仅是几个例子，说明我在学习毛主席著作以后，对　各种问题的看法，思想上所起的变化。当然，我的学习是很不深入的，领会也是很肤浅的，对问题的看法还不会很正确，而且还会有错误。但无论如何，经过学习以后，使我深切地认识到要打破形而上学的思想体系的洋框框，必须以毛泽东思想来武装我们的头脑。
    科学研究工作的发展，同我们思想上的观点和方法有密切的关系。历史告诉我们，凡是唯心论和形而上学的宇宙观抬头的时候，科学的发展，就受到了阻碍；辩证唯物论的宇宙观发展的时候，科学工作也随着迅速发展。要使我国科学很快地赶上和超过国际水平，更好更多地为社会主义建设作出贡献，最重要的环节，也是最快速的途径，是运用毛泽东思想来指导我们的工作。因此，学习毛主席的著作，改造我们的世界观，成为我们科学工作者目前最迫切的革命任务。
