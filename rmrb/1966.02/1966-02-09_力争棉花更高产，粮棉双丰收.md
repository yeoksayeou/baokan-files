    The cotton production in 1965 achieved another bumper harvest on the basis of a substantial increase in production for two consecutive years. However, generally speaking, the level of cotton production in our country is still not high, and there is still a large gap between production and demand. This year is the first year of our country's Third Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. We must increase the production of more cotton to better meet the needs of national construction and people's lives. We must never be satisfied with the achievements we have made, but should summon greater revolutionary vigor, be humble and prudent, be conscientious and meticulous, promote our achievements, overcome our shortcomings, continue to work hard, and strive for higher cotton yields.
    Our country has great potential for cotton production, and it is entirely possible to strive for higher cotton yields. In the past three years, a new situation has emerged in cotton production in our country. In the past, the northern cotton areas with relatively low yields have caught up by leaps and bounds last year. High-yield areas and units have emerged all over the country, from Shanghai in the east to Xinjiang in the west, and from Guangxi in the south to Liaoning in the north, demonstrating the broad development prospects of cotton production in our country. This shows that whether it is the southern cotton area, the northern cotton area, the old cotton area, or the new cotton area, as long as the work is done practically, it is possible to gradually realize large-area high-yield. The current problem is that there is an imbalance in production between regions and units, and the gap is still very large. If, within a cotton-producing area, the communes and teams with roughly the same natural conditions can achieve a roughly balanced cotton yield per unit area, that is, if the units with relatively low yields can catch up with those with relatively high yields, there will be a great leap forward in cotton production in our country. The Baitaizi Brigade of the Linglongta Commune in Jianchang County, Liaoning Province, is surrounded by mountains. Most of the cotton fields are thin on mountain slopes, and the frost-free period is only 150 to 160 days throughout the year. In the past, the lint yield per mu was only 20 to 30 jin. Since 1964, the Party branch of this brigade has led the masses in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings, learning from Dazhai externally, and learning from Liujiazi internally. On the basis of comparing with the advanced and finding gaps, they have actively carried out farmland capital construction projects and reformed cultivation techniques. In 1964, the average lint yield per mu of 340 mu of cotton in the entire brigade was 145 jin; in 1965, the average lint yield per mu of 375 mu of cotton was 190 jin. The Baitaizi Brigade was able to achieve such great production results under the very unfavorable natural conditions of barren soil and a short frost-free period, catching up with and surpassing advanced units. Those units with better conditions or conditions similar to it should also be able to achieve such great results by strengthening all aspects of their work. Facts have proved that as long as we give prominence to politics, strengthen leadership, educate cadres and the masses to establish the idea of growing cotton for the revolution, carry out a comparison, learning, catching-up, and helping movement, and at the same time, make full use of advanced science and technology and the rich practical experience of the masses, we can gradually narrow the gap and achieve large-area balanced production increase. Each cotton-producing area should take the comparison, learning, catching-up, and helping movement as a basic method for leading agricultural production and launch this movement widely and deeply among the masses.
    A very important issue in developing cotton production is to correctly treat and handle the relationship between cotton and grain production. The Fourth National Cotton Conference established the banner of high cotton and grain yields in Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, and issued a call for cotton-producing areas to achieve a bumper harvest of both grain and cotton. This call has been warmly responded to by cadres and the masses in cotton-producing areas. Last year, while grasping cotton production, many cotton-producing areas also grasped grain production, and many counties, communes, and teams with bumper harvests of both cotton and grain emerged. It is entirely correct for cotton-producing areas to take the road of bumper harvests of both cotton and grain. This has great significance for faster and better development of our country's national economy, consolidating and strengthening the collective economy of the people's communes, and further improving the people's lives. In the future, cotton and grain production in all cotton-producing areas should gradually reach and exceed the goals set by the "National Agricultural Development Program," provide more cotton for the country, and achieve grain self-sufficiency on a county-by-county basis, achieving bumper harvests and high yields of both cotton and grain.
    Is this requirement too high to achieve higher cotton yields and grain self-sufficiency and high yields? Practice shows that cotton-producing areas should be required to achieve bumper harvests and high yields of both cotton and grain. This should be done and can be gradually done. The fact that many counties and a large number of communes and teams achieved bumper harvests of both cotton and grain last year vividly proves this point. Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, overcame prolonged low temperatures and rain last year and continued to maintain high yields of both cotton and grain. Tianmen County, Hubei Province, is one of the counties with the largest cotton planting area in our country. Last year, the average lint yield per mu of more than 740,000 mu of cotton fields in the county was more than 120 jin, and the total grain output increased by more than 105 million jin compared with 1964. Tianmen County has a population of one million, and not only has it achieved grain self-sufficiency, but it has also sold a portion of surplus grain. Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, is also an advanced county with bumper harvests of both cotton and grain. Last year, the average lint yield per mu of 197,000 mu of cotton in the county was 142 jin, and grain crops also achieved good harvests on the basis of continuous production increases for three years. The people in the grain area provided an average of more than 620 jin of marketable grain per person. The reason why these places were able to achieve bumper harvests of both cotton and grain is mainly that the vast number of cadres and the masses realized that it is not a good way to develop cotton production by relying on the state to supply grain. It increases the burden on the state and is not conducive to the development of the collective economy and the improvement of the lives of commune members. Therefore, they enthusiastically responded to the call for bumper harvests of both grain and cotton, actively took measures to resolve various contradictions in cotton and grain production, and while grasping cotton production well, they also grasped grain production well. We should seriously summarize the experiences of these places, promote them widely, fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, proceed from reality, take measures according to actual possibilities and local conditions, and strive for more areas and units with bumper harvests and high yields of both cotton and grain this year.
    Striving for higher cotton yields and bumper harvests of both cotton and grain has many very favorable conditions. On the agricultural front, there has been an unprecedentedly widespread and enthusiastic upsurge in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings in recent years; the socialist education movement is being carried out in depth; communes and teams are learning from the People's Liberation Army and Dazhai, and farming for the revolution has become the practical action of the broad masses. In recent years, farmland water conservancy construction has also made great progress, the conditions of fertilizers and improved varieties have been greatly improved, advanced cultivation techniques and field management methods have been gradually accepted and mastered by the broad masses, and the experience in striving for high and bumper cotton yields is becoming more and more abundant. As long as we make full use of these favorable conditions, we can completely strive for another bumper harvest in cotton production this year.
    The recently held Fifth National Cotton Conference summarized and exchanged the experience of cotton production in 1965, put forward the goals for cotton production in 1966, and discussed measures and methods to achieve continued substantial increases in cotton production and bumper harvests of both grain and cotton, and promoted the further mutual learning and competition of the comparison, learning, catching-up, and helping movement among various regions and units. It is hoped that all localities will conscientiously implement the spirit of this conference, continue to implement the cotton production policy of "strengthening leadership, relying on the masses; rational layout, appropriate concentration; summarizing experience, promoting technology; ensuring area, improving yield," seize the opportunity, and fully prepare ideologically, materially, and technically. We must actively carry out the struggle to prevent and control natural disasters such as drought, floods, diseases, and insect pests. Northern cotton areas must strive to grow grain and cotton well in the face of continued drought, and strive to achieve higher cotton yields and bumper harvests of both grain and cotton this year.

### 力争棉花更高产，粮棉双丰收

    力争棉花更高产，粮棉双丰收
    一九六五年的棉花生产，在连续两年大幅度增产的基础上，又获得了大丰收。但是，一般说来，我国棉花生产的水平还是不高，产需之间还存在着较大的差距。今年是我国发展国民经济第三个五年计划的第一年，必须增产更多的棉花，才能更好地满足国家建设和人民生活的需要。我们绝不能满足于已经取得的成绩，而是应该鼓起更大的革命干劲，谦虚谨慎，兢兢业业，发扬成绩、克服缺点，继续努力做好工作，力争棉花更高产。
    我国棉花生产的潜力很大，力争棉花更高产是完全可能的。最近三年，我国棉花生产出现了新形势。过去单产比较低的北方棉区，去年大踏步地赶了上来。全国东起上海，西到新疆，南起广西，北到辽宁，都出现了高额丰产的地区和单位，展示了我国棉花生产广阔发展的前景。这就说明：不论是南方棉区、北方棉区，不论是老棉区、新棉区，只要切实做好工作，都有可能逐步实现大面积高额丰产。目前的问题是：各地区、各单位之间，生产不平衡，差距还很大。如果在一个棉产区内，使自然条件大体相同的社、队，作到棉花单位面积产量大体平衡，也就是说，使产量比较低的赶上产量比较高的，我国的棉花生产就会有一个大的跃进。辽宁省建昌县玲珑塔公社白塔子大队，四面靠山，大部分棉田是山坡薄地，全年无霜期只有一百五、六十天，过去单产皮棉只有二、三十斤。从一九六四年以来，这个大队的党支部领导群众活学活用毛主席著作，外学大寨，内学六家子，在比先进、找差距的基础上，积极兴修农田基本建设工程，改革耕作技术。一九六四年，全大队三百四十亩棉花，平均亩产皮棉一百四十五斤；一九六五年，三百七十五亩棉花，平均亩产皮棉一百九十斤。白塔子大队能够在土质瘠薄、无霜期短的非常不利的自然条件下，取得这样大的生产成绩，赶上和超过先进单位，那些条件比它还好或者条件同它相当的单位，在加强各方面工作的条件下，也应该能够取得这样大的成绩。事实证明：只要突出政治，加强领导，教育干部和群众树立为革命种棉的思想，开展比学赶帮超运动，同时充分运用先进的科学技术和群众丰富的实践经验，就能够逐步缩小差距，实现大面积平衡增产。各棉产区应该把比学赶帮超运动作为领导农业生产的基本方法，发动群众广泛而深入地开展这一运动。
    发展棉花生产的一个十分重要的问题，是正确对待和处理棉粮生产的关系。全国第四次棉花会议，树立了江苏省启东县棉粮双高产的旗帜，发出了产棉区要实现棉粮双丰收的号召，这个号召得到了产棉区干部、群众的热烈响应。去年，很多棉区在抓棉花生产的同时，大抓粮食生产，又出现了许多棉粮双丰产的县和大批社、队。产棉区走棉粮双丰收的道路是完全正确的。这对于更快更好地发展我国国民经济，巩固和壮大人民公社集体经济，进一步改善人民生活，有重大的作用和深远的意义。今后，各产棉区的棉粮生产都应该逐步达到和超过“农业发展纲要”规定的目标，多为国家提供棉花，并且以县为单位作到粮食自给，实现棉粮双丰收、双高产。
    既要棉花更高产，又要粮食自给和高产，这个要求是不是太高了？实践表明：应该对产棉区提出实现棉粮双丰收、双高产的要求，这是应该做到和能够逐步做到的。去年许多县和大批社队实现棉粮双丰收的事实，生动地证明了这一点。江苏省启东县去年战胜长期低温阴雨，继续保持棉粮双高产。湖北省天门是我国植棉面积最大的一个县，去年全县七十四万多亩棉田，平均亩产皮棉一百二十斤以上，粮食总产量比一九六四年增产一亿零五百多万斤。天门县有百万人口，不仅实现了粮食自给自足，还出售了一部分余粮。江苏省常熟县也是棉粮双丰收的先进县。去年，全县十九万七千多亩棉花，平均亩产皮棉一百四十二斤，粮食作物也在连续三年增产的基础上，取得了较好的收成，粮区人民平均每人提供商品粮六百二十多斤。这些地方所以能够做到棉粮双丰收，主要是广大干部和群众认识到了：靠国家供应粮食来发展棉花生产，不是好的办法，既增加了国家的负担，又不利于集体经济的发展和社员生活的改善。因此，他们热烈响应粮棉双丰收的号召，积极采取措施，解决棉粮生产中的各种矛盾，在抓好棉花生产的同时，也抓好了粮食生产。应该认真总结这些地方的经验，把它们推而广之，充分发动群众、依靠群众，从实际出发，按照实际的可能，因地制宜地采取措施，力争今年出现更多的棉粮双丰收、双高产的地区和单位。
    力争棉花更高产，棉粮双丰收，有着许多非常有利的条件。在农业战线上，近年来出现了空前广泛、空前热烈的活学活用毛主席著作的高潮；社会主义教育运动正在深入开展；社社队队学解放军、学大寨，为革命种田已经成为广大群众的实际行动。近几年来，农田水利建设又有了很大的发展，肥料、良种的状况有了很大的改善，先进的栽培技术和田间管理方法已逐步为广大群众接受和掌握，争取棉花高额丰产的经验越来越丰富。只要充分利用这些有利条件，就完全可以争取今年的棉花生产再来一个大丰收。
    最近召开的全国第五次棉花会议，总结交流了一九六五年棉花生产经验，提出了一九六六年棉花生产的奋斗目标，讨论了实现棉花继续大幅度增产、粮棉双丰收的措施和办法，推动了各地区、各单位进一步互相学习、互相竞赛的比学赶帮超运动。希望各地认真贯彻这次会议的精神，继续贯彻执行“加强领导，依靠群众；合理布局，适当集中；总结经验，推广技术；保证面积，提高单产”的棉花生产方针，抓紧时机，在思想上、物质上、技术上充分做好各项准备工作，积极开展防治旱、涝、病、虫等自然灾害的斗争，北方棉区特别要力争在旱情持续的情况下种好粮食和棉花，为争取实现今年棉花更高产，粮棉双丰收而奋斗。
