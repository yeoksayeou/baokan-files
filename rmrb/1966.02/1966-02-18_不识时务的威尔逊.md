    British Prime Minister Wilson's speech in the House of Commons on February 8th is yet another exposure of the Labor government's ugly face as an accomplice to the American aggression in Vietnam, and another disgraceful performance in its coordination with the American anti-China conspiracy.

    In his speech, in addition to applauding the US resumption of bombing of North Vietnam and promoting the US "peace talks" fraud, Wilson openly directed his attack at China. He viciously insinuated that China was an "enemy of peace" and an "enemy of negotiation," and even shamelessly incited members of Parliament to demonstrate in front of the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in London, saying, "I would like to see extra-parliamentary activities for peace in Vietnam outside the Chinese Embassy."

    With Wilson taking the lead, other British officials have also continuously made anti-China remarks in Parliament. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and government spokesman Walston was very enthusiastic, attacking China as "Chinese imperialism" and "invading China's neighbors" one moment, and clamoring that Britain must pursue a "policy of containment (of China)" the next.

    This is not the first time the British Labor government has been anti-China. Since Wilson came to power, he has repeatedly made anti-China remarks, and they have become increasingly malicious. The year before last, he falsely accused China of carrying out "subversion" in Africa. Last year, he clamored that China's nuclear power was a "threat to its neighbors," attacked China's action of ordering the invading Indian troops to remove their aggressive fortifications as "fishing in troubled waters," and incited people, in his capacity as leader of the Labor Party, to take "placards demanding peace in Vietnam" "to the Chinese Embassy." Today, Wilson has gone a step further, recklessly slandering China in the open forum of Parliament, and even inciting people again to make trouble at the doors of China's diplomatic representatives. Such an act of instigating trouble in the capacity of head of government is rare in international relations. This can only show that the British Labor government has degenerated to the point of using any means to incite anti-China sentiment.

    Wilson's concentrated attack on China, particularly on the Vietnam issue, is by no means accidental.

    Whenever the United States is in trouble over the Vietnam issue, the British Labor government invariably comes out to help, and this has almost become a rule. At present, American imperialism, deeply mired in the quagmire of the Vietnam War, is in a state of internal and external difficulties and is besieged on all sides. Johnson is frowning and at a loss. Wilson has seized the opportunity and stepped forward again.

    Wilson's attack on China as an "enemy of peace" and an "enemy of negotiation" is nothing more than to say that the American aggressors are peace-loving and sincerely hope that the Vietnam issue can be resolved politically; since this is the case, people should not oppose the United States, but should condemn China. Wilson's real intention is to instigate more countries in the world to join the American anti-China front and launch a new anti-China wave.

    However, Mr. Wilson is too unenlightened and overestimates himself.

    American imperialism is the culprit for tearing up the Geneva Accords, invading Vietnam, expanding the war, and undermining peace in Vietnam. The Johnson government has publicly declared that the United States will "stick it out" in Vietnam and will never withdraw its troops from South Vietnam, nor will it recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the sole legal representative of the South Vietnamese people. Does Wilson really think that a few words in Parliament will cover up the bloody hands of the American aggressors in front of the people of the world?! This is absolutely impossible. Even if Wilson puts powder on the face of the United States every day, it will not change the fact that the United States is the ferocious executioner who is slaughtering the Vietnamese people. On the contrary, Wilson's doing so only puts himself in the dirty position of an accomplice to the United States.

    On the Vietnam issue, the British Labor government has long been in the ranks of the enemies of the Vietnamese people. In the year or more since the United States expanded its war of aggression against Vietnam, the Wilson government has followed in the footsteps of the United States, leaving a shameful record:

    When the United States bombed North Vietnam, expanding the war to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Wilson government actually said that this was "necessary" and "an action that should be taken."

    When the United States increased its troops in South Vietnam and engaged in large-scale fighting in South Vietnam, Wilson excused the United States, saying that "this was inevitable" and that the United States could not be held responsible for the "gradual escalation" of the war.

    When the United States put forward the "unconditional discussions" fraud, Wilson took the lead in expressing "very warm welcome" and sent senior British government officials to run around, offering advice and acting as political brokers.

    When the United States declared that it must stay in South Vietnam, the Wilson government attacked the proposal to withdraw American troops from South Vietnam as "too one-sided."

    When the United States' "bombing pause" trick failed and it brazenly resumed bombing North Vietnam, Wilson immediately clamored that Britain "has an obligation" to support this aggressive action by the United States.

    The United States is not reconciled to the repeated bankruptcy of its "peace talks" conspiracy and has indicated that it will continue to engage in it, and Wilson quickly declared that Britain "gives full support" to the United States' "great peace offensive."

    Look, they sing in harmony and echo each other. The face of a lackey of American imperialism is truly vivid and lifelike. It should be emphasized that the Wilson government has long exceeded its predecessors in its degree of subservience to the United States. The British government is so loyal to the United States and so wholeheartedly helps the United States that it truly deserves to be a satellite state of the United States.

    The British Labor government's following the United States step by step and actively opposing China also has its own needs for imperialist interests. As everyone knows, the once great British Empire has now become a dilapidated household with stretched resources. In order to maintain its disintegrating Commonwealth, control its traditional colonial sphere of influence, and suppress the booming national liberation movement in Asia and Africa, Britain has formulated a so-called "East of Suez" policy. However, to implement the "East of Suez" policy, Britain feels that its strength is not equal to its ambitions. Therefore, the British Labor government further colludes with the United States by supporting the American aggression against Vietnam and the policy of encircling and containing China in exchange for American support. Therefore, the British "East of Suez" policy is actually an important step for Britain to join forces with the United States in establishing an "encirclement" around China, and an important step for Britain to cooperate with American imperialism in shifting its global strategy to the east. It can be understood that the reason why the Labor government colludes with the United States and is willing to be hostile to the Vietnamese people is that it fears that the victorious development of the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle will fundamentally shake the interests of British imperialism in the East. Similarly, the reason why the Labor government contributes to the American anti-China conspiracy to encircle China is that China's firm position in supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle and resolutely supporting the liberation struggles of all oppressed nations and oppressed people is seen by Britain as an important obstacle and major threat to its implementation of the "East of Suez" counter-revolutionary strategic policy.

    However, times have changed. At present, the national liberation struggles in Asia, Africa and Latin America are like raging tides. The days when the British Empire was a hegemonic power, calling itself "the empire on which the sun never sets," have naturally become historical relics, and even the American imperialism, which claims to be the most powerful, is also declining. The British Labor government's combining its own destiny with the American policy of aggression against Vietnam and opposition to China will ultimately not only fail to gain any advantage, but will only be buried with the American policy of aggression and war, and will never have a good ending.

    不识时务的威尔逊
    本报评论员
    英国首相威尔逊二月八日在下院的发言，是工党政府充当美国侵越帮凶的丑恶面目的又一次暴露，也是它配合美国反华阴谋的又一次不光采的表演。
    威尔逊在发言中，除了为美国恢复轰炸越南北方叫好、为美国推行“和谈”骗局捧场之外，公然把攻击的矛头指向中国。他恶毒地影射攻击中国是“和平的敌人”、“谈判的敌人”，甚至无耻地煽动议员们到伦敦中国驻英代办处门前示威，说什么“我倒是希望在中国大使馆外能看到争取越南和平的会外活动”。
    威尔逊带头定了调子，英国其他官方人士也不断在议会发表反华言论。外交部次官兼政府发言人沃尔斯顿十分起劲，一会儿攻击中国是“中国帝国主义”、“侵略中国的邻国”，一会儿叫嚷英国必须奉行“遏制（中国的）政策”。
    英国工党政府反华，这并不是第一遭。威尔逊上台以来，一再发表反华言论，而且越来越恶劣。前年，他诬蔑中国在非洲进行“颠覆”。去年，他叫嚷中国的核力量是“对邻国的威胁”，攻击中国勒令入侵印军撤除侵略工事的行动是“混水摸鱼”，并且以工党首领的身份唆使人们拿着“要求越南和平的标语牌”“到中国使馆去”。今天，威尔逊更进一步，不惜在议会的大庭广众之间，放肆地诋毁中国，甚至再次煽动人们到中国的外交代表机构门口去闹事。这种以政府首脑的身份进行煽风点火的做法，在国际关系中是罕见的。这只能说明：英国工党政府为了煽动反华，已经堕落到不择手段的地步。
    威尔逊特别在越南问题上集中攻击中国，决不是偶然的。
    每当美国在越南问题上陷于困境的时候，英国工党政府照例要出来帮一手，这几乎已成了一条定律。目前，深陷侵越泥潭中的美帝国主义内外交困、四面楚歌，约翰逊紧锁双眉、一筹莫展。威尔逊看准时机，又挺身而出了。
    威尔逊攻击中国是“和平的敌人”、“谈判的敌人”，无非是要说：美国侵略者是爱好和平的，是真心诚意地希望越南问题得到政治解决的；既然如此，人们就不应该反对美国，而是应该谴责中国。威尔逊的真实意图，就是要唆使世界上更多的国家参加美国的反华阵线，掀起新的反华浪潮。
    但是，威尔逊先生未免太不识时务，太不自量力了。
    美帝国主义是撕毁日内瓦协议、侵略越南的祸首，是扩大战争、破坏越南和平的罪魁。约翰逊政府公开宣称美国要在越南“干到底”，决不从南越撤军，决不承认越南南方民族解放阵线是南越人民的唯一合法代表。难道威尔逊真的以为，他在议会上咿哩哇啦几句，就能在世界人民面前遮盖住美国侵略越南的血手！？这是绝对办不到的。即使威尔逊天天替美国脸上搽粉，也改变不了美国是屠杀越南人民的刽子手的凶恶面目。相反地，威尔逊这样做，只是把自己置于美国帮凶的肮脏境地。
    在越南问题上，英国工党政府置身于越南人民的敌对者的行列，已是由来已久了。美国扩大侵越战争的一年多来，威尔逊政府踩着美国的脚印走路，留下了可耻的记录：
    美国轰炸越南北方，把战争扩大到越南民主共和国，威尔逊政府竟然说这是“必需的”，是“应该采取的行动”。
    美国增兵越南南方，在南越大打出手，威尔逊为美国推卸罪责，说“这是不可避免的”，美国不能对战争“逐步升级”负责。
    美国提出“无条件讨论”的骗局，威尔逊率先表示“非常热烈地欢迎”，并且派出英国政府大员，四出奔走，出谋划策，甘愿充当政治掮客。
    美国宣称一定要赖在南越不走，威尔逊政府就攻击要美军撤出南越的主张是“太片面”了。
    美国“暂停轰炸”的花招碰壁，悍然恢复对越南北方的轰炸，威尔逊马上叫嚷英国“有义务”支持美国的这一侵略行动。
    美国不甘心“和谈”阴谋的接连破产，表示要继续搞下去，威尔逊就赶紧表白英国对美国“伟大的和平攻势”“给予完全的支持”。
    请看，一唱一和，此呼彼应，一副美帝国主义走卒的嘴脸，真是维妙维肖，活灵活现。应该着重指出，威尔逊政府在屈从美国的程度方面，早已超过了它的前任。英国政府这样忠心耿耿为美国效劳，这样死心塌地为美国帮腔，真不愧为美国的卫星国了。
    英国工党政府亦步亦趋地追随美国，积极反华，也有其帝国主义利益的自身需要。大家知道，昔日的大英帝国，今天已成了捉襟见肘的破落户。英国为了维系它分崩离析的英联邦，控制它传统的殖民势力范围，镇压蓬勃高涨的亚非民族解放运动，制订了一个所谓“苏伊士以东”的政策。但是，要推行“苏伊士以东”的政策，英国深感心有余而力不足。于是，英国工党政府就以支持美国侵略越南、包围和遏制中国政策的行动，同美国进一步勾结，来换取美国的支持。因此，英国的“苏伊士以东”政策，实际上是英国伙同美国在中国周围建立“包围圈”的一个重要步骤，也是英国配合美帝国主义把全球战略东移而采取的一个重要步骤。这就可以理解，工党政府所以勾结美国、不惜同越南人民为敌，是因为害怕越南人民革命斗争的胜利发展，将从根本上动摇英帝国主义在东方的利益。同样地，工党政府所以为美国包围中国的反华阴谋出力，是因为中国人民坚决支持越南人民斗争、坚决支持一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民解放斗争的立场，被英国看成是它推行“苏伊士以东”反革命战略方针的一个重要障碍和重大威胁。
    但是，时代已经不同了。目前，亚非拉的民族解放斗争，有如怒潮澎湃。英帝国称雄一时，以“日不没国”自居的日子，固然成了历史的陈迹，就是号称最强大的美帝国主义，也在走下坡路。英国工党政府把自己的命运同美国侵略越南、反对中国的政策结合在一起，到头来，不仅捞不到什么便宜，最终只能为美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策殉葬，而决不会有什么美妙的下场。
