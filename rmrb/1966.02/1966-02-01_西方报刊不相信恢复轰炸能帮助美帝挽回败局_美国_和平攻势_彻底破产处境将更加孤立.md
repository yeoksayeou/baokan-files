    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 31st—American and Western European bourgeois newspapers admit that the U.S. resumption of bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam proves the bankruptcy of the "peace offensive" plotted by Johnson. They point out that the Johnson administration's "peace offensive" is nothing more than a smokescreen to cover up its further expansion of the war, and that the U.S. resumption of bombing cannot save the U.S. from defeat in South Vietnam, but will only deepen the U.S. government's internal and external predicament.
    Associated Press reporter Curley said in a commentary on the 31st that "with President Johnson ordering the resumption of air strikes against North Vietnam, the (U.S. government's) 37-day peace offensive has today ended in failure."
    A report from Agence France-Presse from Paris on the 31st quoted "Le Nouvel Observateur" as saying: "The U.S. resumption of bombing of North Vietnam proves that President Johnson's peace offensive has failed."
    Many Western newspapers admit that the U.S. "peace offensive" is nothing more than a smokescreen for its expansion of the war.
    An editorial in the French newspaper *Les Echos* pointed out that the "peace offensive," including the "suspension of bombing," is a "smokescreen" for the U.S. determination to continue the war, and that "ultimately, the U.S. is not interested in peace." The French newspaper *Combat* said: "This famous 'peace offensive' is nothing more than a smokescreen to cover up the re-preparation for 'gradual escalation'." An article in *International Forum* magazine on January 7th also said: "The massive diplomatic fireworks that Johnson has just released to us are designed to cover up his absurd behavior, and once these diplomatic fireworks... extinguish, the slaughter will resume."
    The British magazine *Tribune* published a commentary on the 7th saying that the U.S. recent playing with the "peace offensive" was to "prepare for a bigger war." It said: "Even countries friendly to the U.S. do not know whether its solemnly declared desire for peace and a fair settlement is as sincere as it is heavily publicized."
    The magazine believes that the measure of the U.S.'s "peace sincerity" is whether the U.S. is willing to withdraw from South Vietnam.
    The West German *Deutsche Volkszeitung* pointed out on January 7th that "despite all the peace pledges, the U.S. government has in fact firmly made up its mind to continue to spin on the spiral of the Vietnam War... The U.S.'s military, financial, and political preparations in 1966 also show this."
    Before Johnson ordered the resumption of bombing, many American and Western European newspapers believed that U.S. bombing of North Vietnam could not save it from defeat in South Vietnam but would only deepen the U.S. government's internal and external predicament. The *New York Times* published a report by its reporter Wicker on the 28th saying that many people in Washington believe that "the military value of last year's bombing was small," and that resuming bombing will not help the U.S. out of its predicament, because "if the intense bombing from (last) February to December failed to force the Communists to the conference table, then resuming bombing now will only make their determination to resist even stronger." The report also pointed out that many people in Washington are worried that resuming bombing will "alienate the U.S. government from world opinion" and will cause "political consequences" domestically in the face of growing public opposition to the expansion of the war. In addition, some Americans are also worried that "a new round of bombing" will increase the "danger of confrontation" with China.
    United Press International said on the 31st that "the resumption of air strikes against North Vietnam is expected to ignite a powder keg like a spark, and this powder keg is the increasingly fierce debate in Congress over the government's Vietnam policy." In this debate, those who criticize the policies adopted by the U.S. in the war are increasingly openly demanding a greater say in decision-making.
    The *Washington Post* published an editorial on the 16th, admitting that resuming bombing will not save the lives of American aggressors. The editorial said, "There are not many reasons to believe that an unlimited air strike will achieve decisive results." On the contrary, "The actual results are likely to be the same as the results of regional bombing during World War II, which was not decisive." The editorial also said, "Expanding the conflict may simply push the war into another larger battlefield," which "will require us to bear heavier obligations than we have assumed so far."
    The British newspaper *The Times* published an article by its Washington correspondent on the 31st, pointing out that the U.S. resumption of bombing of North Vietnam will make the Johnson government more isolated at home and abroad. The article said that many Western countries and non-aligned countries will "immediately react unfavorably." As for the United States, "with a group of Democratic senators expressing deep unease, the President's exercise of power and the implementation of a tougher line will face a more serious challenge in terms of morality."

### 西方报刊不相信恢复轰炸能帮助美帝挽回败局  美国“和平攻势”彻底破产处境将更加孤立

    西方报刊不相信恢复轰炸能帮助美帝挽回败局
    美国“和平攻势”彻底破产处境将更加孤立
    据新华社三十一日讯　华盛顿消息：美国和西欧资产阶级报刊承认，美国恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸证明约翰逊策划的“和平攻势”的破产。它们指出，约翰逊政府的“和平攻势”不过是掩盖它进一步扩大战争的烟幕，而美国恢复轰炸并不能挽救美国在南越的败局，只能加深美国政府内外交困的窘境。
    美联社记者纠利克三十一日在一篇评论中说，“随着约翰逊总统下令恢复对北越的空袭，（美国政府）三十七天的和平攻势今天已经以失败告终”。
    法新社三十一日从巴黎发出的报道引“法国观察家”的话说：“美国恢复对北越的轰炸证明约翰逊总统和平攻势已经失败。”
    许多西方报刊承认，美国的“和平攻势”只不过是它扩大战争的烟幕。
    法国《回声报》的社论指出，包括“暂停轰炸”在内的“和平攻势”是美国决心继续进行战争的“烟幕”，“归根结蒂，美国对和平是不感兴趣的”。法国《战斗报》说：“这种著名的‘和平攻势’只不过是掩盖重新准备‘逐步升级’的一种烟幕。”《国际论坛》周刊一月七日的文章也说：“约翰逊刚刚向我们放出的大量的外交焰火，旨在掩盖他的荒唐行为，这种外交焰火……一熄灭，屠杀就会恢复。”
    英国《论坛》周刊七日发表评论说，美国最近玩弄“和平攻势”，是为了“准备进行更大的战争”。它说：“甚至同美国友好的国家，也不知道它信誓旦旦地宣布的企求和平和公平解决的愿望是否象大肆宣传的那样真诚。”
    这家周刊认为，考验美国“和平诚意”的尺度是：美国到底是否愿意从南越撤走。
    西德的《德意志人民报》一月七日指出，“尽管有一切和平誓言，美国政府实际上已坚定地下了决心，继续在越南战争的螺旋线上打转……美国一九六六年在军事、财政和政治上的准备也表明了这一点。”
    在约翰逊下令恢复轰炸以前，美国和西欧的许多报刊都认为美国轰炸北越并不能挽救它在南越的败局而只能加深美国政府内外交困的窘境。《纽约时报》二十八日刊载它的记者威克的一篇报道说，华盛顿许多人认为，“去年轰炸的军事价值很小”，而恢复轰炸对美国摆脱困境也将无济于事，因为“如果从（去年）二月直到十二月进行的紧张轰炸都未能迫使共产党人走向会议桌旁，那么，现在恢复轰炸也只能使他们的抵抗决心更加坚定”。这篇报道还指出，华盛顿有许多人担心恢复轰炸将使美国政府同“世界舆论疏远”，而且会在美国公众日益反对扩大战争的情况下在国内引起“政治后果”。此外，美国一些人还担心“新的一轮轰炸”将增加同中国“对峙的危险”。
    合众国际社三十一日说，“恢复对北越的空袭预料将象火星一样触发起一个火药桶的爆炸，这个火药桶就是国会对政府的越南政策越来越激烈的辩论”。在这场辩论中，批评美国在战争中采取的政策的人正越来越公开地要求在决策时有更大的发言权。
    《华盛顿邮报》十六日发表社论，承认恢复轰炸救不了美国侵略者的命。社论说，“没有很多理由能够相信一场无限制的空袭会取得决定性的结果”，相反地，“实际结果很可能同第二次世界大战期间的地区轰炸的结果一样，并没有决定性意义”。社论还说，“扩大冲突可能只是使战争进入另一个更大的战场”，而这“将需要我们承担比迄今所承担的更沉重的义务”。
    英国《泰晤士报》三十一日刊载它驻华盛顿记者的一篇文章指出，美国对越南北方恢复轰炸将使约翰逊政府在国内外更加孤立。文章说，许多西方国家和不结盟国家将会“立即作出不利反应”。至于美国国内，“在一批民主党参议员表示深深不安的情况下，总统行使权力，执行更加强硬的路线，这就会在道义上面临更严重的挑战”。
