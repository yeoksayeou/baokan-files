    The workers in South Korea, under the occupation of the American aggressors, have recently and continuously held strikes and launched various struggles to oppose the brutal exploitation by the U.S. imperialists and their running dog, the Park Chung-hee clique. Their struggle is completely justified and righteous. However, it has been subjected to the barbarous suppression by the U.S.-Park clique. The military police of the U.S. military bases even blatantly used force, killing and wounding many striking workers, causing serious bloodshed.
    This atrocity of the American aggressors fully exposes them as the most ferocious enemy of the South Korean people, and their aggression and oppression are the root of the suffering and disaster of the South Korean people. As long as the American aggressors do not get out of South Korea, they will never stop doing evil, and the South Korean people will never have peace.
    However, the bayonets of the American military police cannot intimidate the South Korean people, but can only arouse their stronger hatred and more resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism. The blood of the South Korean workers shed in front of the U.S. military bases is not only evidence of the crimes of the U.S. aggressor troops, but also a powerful call to the South Korean people to intensify their struggle.
    There is an old Chinese saying, "He who commits many unrighteous acts is sure to destroy himself." The more rampant and evil U.S. imperialism becomes, the faster it will accelerate its own demise. The South Korean people will never tolerate U.S. imperialism's long-term occupation of their territory, nor will they tolerate U.S. imperialism's revival of Japanese militarism, causing it to re-invade Korea. They will one day completely bury the American aggressors and their followers and realize the reunification of the motherland.

### 多行不义必自毙

    多行不义必自毙
    在美国侵略者占领下的南朝鲜的工人，为了反对美帝国主义及其走狗朴正熙集团的残酷压榨，最近连续不断举行罢工，展开各种斗争。他们的斗争，完全是合理的，正义的。但是，却遭到美朴集团的野蛮镇压。美军基地的宪兵甚至悍然使用武力，杀伤许多罢工工人，造成严重的流血事件。
    美国侵略者的这种暴行，充分暴露了他们是南朝鲜人民最凶恶的敌人，他们的侵略和压迫是南朝鲜人民苦难和灾害的根源。只要美国侵略者一天不从南朝鲜滚出去，他们就决不会停止为非作歹，南朝鲜人民也决无宁日。
    然而，美国宪兵的刺刀并不能吓倒南朝鲜人民，而只能激起他们对于美帝国主义的更强烈的仇恨和更坚决的斗争。在美军基地门前洒下的南朝鲜工人的鲜血，不但是控诉美国侵略军暴行的罪证，而且也是唤起南朝鲜人民加紧战斗的有力号召。
    中国古话说，“多行不义必自毙”。美帝国主义越是横行霸道，作恶多端，就越会加速它自己的死亡的到来。南朝鲜人民决不会容忍美帝国主义长期霸占他们的国土，决不会忍受美帝国主义复活日本军国主义，使之重新侵略朝鲜。他们终有一天要把美国侵略者及其追随者彻底埋葬，实现祖国的统一。
