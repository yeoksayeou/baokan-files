    Examining Oneself, Finding Shortcomings
    After reading the article "The Model of County Party Secretary – Jiao Yulu," I was deeply educated and greatly encouraged.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's thought was revolutionary thought, his working methods were scientific working methods, and his style was the traditional style of the Party. All of this was the result of his holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and adhering to the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Comrade Jiao Yulu's vivid facts prove that only Communist Party members armed with Mao Zedong Thought are true Communist Party members; only cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought are truly revolutionary cadres; only Party members and cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought can serve the people completely and thoroughly, and can correctly lead the masses to overcome all kinds of difficulties and seize victory after victory. Comrade Jiao Yulu's facts show that to make revolution, one must first revolutionize oneself; and to revolutionize oneself, the leadership must first be revolutionized. Comrade Jiao Yulu has set an example for us in this regard; he is an outstanding representative of the revolutionization of county Party committee leadership.
    Compared to Comrade Jiao Yulu, after examining myself, although I have done some work under the leadership of the Party, I am still far from meeting the Party's requirements. Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, I still have many shortcomings. My working methods are not comprehensive or meticulous enough, my work style is not deep or solid enough, especially in my thinking, I have not yet thoroughly realized revolutionization.
    I am determined to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly; to learn his scientific working methods; to learn his excellent working style. Like him, I will hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, conscientiously study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, transform my non-proletarian worldview, establish a proletarian revolutionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death, and better complete the glorious tasks assigned to me by the Party.

    对照自己，找找差距
    我读了《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》一文以后，受到深刻的教育，巨大的鼓舞。
    焦裕禄同志的思想是革命的思想，工作方法是科学的工作方法，作风是党的传统作风，这一切都是他高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚持活学活用毛主席著作的结果。焦裕禄同志生动的事实证明：只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党员，才是真正的共产党员，只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的干部，才是真正革命的干部，只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的党员和干部，才能完全地、彻底地为人民服务，才能够正确地领导群众，克服种种困难，夺取节节胜利。焦裕禄同志的事实表明：要革命，首先必须人革命，要想人革命，首先又必须是领导革命。焦裕禄同志在这方面给我们作出了榜样，他是县委领导革命化的出色的代表。
    对照焦裕禄同志，检查了自己，在党的领导下，尽管自己也作了一些工作，但是距党的要求还相差很远；和焦裕禄同志相比，自己还有许多差距。工作方法还不够全面、细致，工作作风还不够深入、扎实，特别是在思想上，还没有彻底实现革命化。
    我决心学习焦裕禄同志全心全意为人民服务的革命精神；学习他科学的工作方法；学习他优良的工作作风。象他那样更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，认真活学活用毛主席著作，改造自己的非无产阶级世界观，树立起一不怕苦、二不怕死的无产阶级革命精神，更好地完成党交给的光荣任务。
