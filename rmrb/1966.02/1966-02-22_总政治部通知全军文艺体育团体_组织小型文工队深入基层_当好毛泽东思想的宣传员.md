They are to treat the organization of cultural work teams as the key focus of work in 1966.
    The notice pointed out that the instructions of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long are extremely important and must be resolutely implemented. By following these instructions, we can better implement the Mao Zedong line on literature and art, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers; we can better highlight politics in the military arts and sports teams, strengthen combat readiness, and implement the five principles of highlighting politics as instructed by Comrade Lin Biao; it can be more conducive to making literary and art work serve to promote proletarian ideology and eradicate bourgeois ideology, consolidate and improve combat effectiveness.
    The notice requires all military cultural troupes (teams), military bands (teams), and sports teams to, after participating in the socialist education movement in 1966, with the exception of personnel assigned to specific tasks, form cultural work teams to go deep into the grassroots in batches, starting in February. The cultural work teams should hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study Chairman Mao's works well, and serve as propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. The specific tasks are: performance, guidance, creation, service, and investigation, and through these activities, to conduct training, better strengthen the ideological revolutionization of literary and sports workers, enrich life, promote creation, and cultivate more revolutionary successors to the literary and sports cause who are both red and expert, and proficient in multiple skills. The time spent by the cultural work teams should be more than half a year.
