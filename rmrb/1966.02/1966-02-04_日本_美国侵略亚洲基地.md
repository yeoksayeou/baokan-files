    Under the collusion of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, the entirety of Japan has become an important military and logistical base for the U.S. aggression against Vietnam and Asia. U.S. warships, aircraft, artillery, and combat troops are being continuously dispatched from the Japanese mainland and Okinawa to Vietnam to conduct the war of aggression.

    More than two hundred U.S. military bases are scattered throughout Japan. They are centered around Tokyo, the capital of Japan. In Tokyo, there are as many as twenty-four U.S. military bases and facilities, making it an important nest for U.S. aggression against Asia. Fifteen years ago, during the U.S. war of aggression against Korea, the U.S. used Yokota and Tachikawa, the largest U.S. Air Force bases in Tokyo, to bomb the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Today, they are being used again as bases for aggression against Vietnam. The U.S. B52 heavy bombers, which have committed monstrous crimes by indiscriminately bombing Vietnam, have taken off from Yokota Air Base. Since last August, the U.S. has been rushing troops, ammunition, weapons, medicines, and food to South Vietnam through the Yokota and Tachikawa bases overnight.

    According to an issue of "Asahi Weekly" published at the end of last year, the U.S. military has deployed F105 tactical fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs at the Itazuke Base on Kyushu Island in southern Japan. Hakata Port, near Itazuke, has also become a port for the U.S. Air Force to transport munitions. Kitakyushu City has become a U.S. arms depot and supply base for aggression against Vietnam. In addition, the U.S. is using Yokohama, Hiroshima, and Shimotsu Port in Wakayama Prefecture to transport artillery shells, sandbags, various military trucks, gasoline, cement, blood plasma, communication equipment, and other military supplies to South Vietnam.

    Okinawa, Japan, has become a forward base for U.S. aggression against Vietnam. Therefore, the Japanese bourgeois newspapers also pointed out that the Japanese mainland and Okinawa have become important bases for U.S. aggression against Vietnam and for expanding the war of aggression in Asia.

    日本—美国侵略亚洲基地
    在美日反动派相互勾结下，整个日本已经成为美国侵略越南和亚洲的重要军事基地和后勤基地。美国的军舰、飞机、大炮和作战部队等，正从日本本土和冲绳源源派往越南进行侵略战争。
    有两百多个美国军事基地遍布在日本各地。它们以日本首都东京为中心。在东京，美国的军事基地和军事设施有二十四处之多，是美国侵略亚洲的重要巢穴。在十五年前美国进行侵朝战争的时候，美国就曾利用东京最大的美军空军基地横田、立川，轰炸过朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，今天它又被利用来作为侵略越南的基地。对越南滥施轰炸犯下滔天罪行的美国B52重型轰炸机，有的就是从横田机场起飞的。自从去年八月以来，美国通过横田、立川的基地连夜向南越赶运兵员、弹药武器、医药品和粮食等。
    据去年年底出版的一期《朝日周刊》透露，在日本南部九州岛的板付基地，美军部署了可载核弹的F105型战术战斗机，板付附近的博多港，也变成了美国空军运送军火的码头。北九州市已经成为美国侵略越南的军火仓库和供应基地。此外，美国还利用横滨、广岛、和歌山县的下津港，把炮弹、沙包、各种军用卡车、汽油、水泥、血浆、通讯器材等各种军用物资源源运往南越。
    日本的冲绳，已经成了美国侵略越南的前进基地。因此，日本资产阶级报刊也指出、日本本土和冲绳，已经变成美国侵略越南和在亚洲扩大侵略战争的重要基地。
