　　New China News Agency, Saigon, 20th dispatch: South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces fiercely bombarded the US 1st Cavalry Division's base camp in An Khe (Gia Lai Province) with mortars on the night of the 19th.
　　According to Western news agencies, the bombardment lasted for an hour. "This is the first attack of this kind suffered by the (American) cavalry since they entered their position last September." "When the cavalry division first arrived in An Khe, they were attacked by sniper fire." The Liberation Army's bombardment made the enemy panic. The Associated Press admitted that the camp is now relatively empty, "with only one brigade guarding it." The other two brigades of the 1st Cavalry Division are conducting "mopping-up" operations near Phu My in Binh Dinh Province. Reports indicate that the US invading forces have encountered fierce resistance from the Liberation Army during these "mopping-up" operations.
　　In other news, the Liberation Armed Forces once again cut off the railway line from Da Nang to Hue on the 19th. Approximately five kilometers of the railway line were destroyed, paralyzing railway transport. On the morning of the 20th, the Liberation Armed Forces also bombarded an enemy airfield and nearby enemy camp in Can Tho Province, southwest of Saigon, causing casualties and losses to the enemy. On the 19th, the Liberation Armed Forces also blew up a puppet army restaurant 16 kilometers north of Saigon, injuring ten puppet soldiers.
　　New China News Agency, Hanoi, 19th dispatch: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the South Vietnamese Bien Hoa Province Liberation Armed Forces, from January 28th to February 3rd, continuously thwarted enemy "mopping-up" operations, killing and wounding a total of 165 US invading forces and puppet troops, 54 puppet soldiers, shot down eight US helicopters, destroyed three amphibious armored vehicles, and seized a large quantity of weapons and ammunition.
　　According to reports, on January 28th, 6,000 US invading forces, puppet troops, and puppet soldiers, under the cover of more than 100 aircraft, 93 armored vehicles, and 24 warships, launched a large-scale "mopping-up" operation in the mountainous area of Nhon Trach District, Bien Hoa Province. After the US puppet troops indiscriminately bombed and shelled many villages along Highways 17 and 19 with aircraft and artillery, the infantry, along with amphibious armored vehicles, advanced from Long Thanh city toward the mountainous area, committing all kinds of atrocities along the way, including murder and arson.
　　The local Liberation Armed Forces bravely met the enemy, repelled the US invading forces that were invading the villages of Phuoc An and Phuoc Thien, killing and wounding dozens of enemy soldiers. The remaining enemy soldiers fled in panic along their original route.
　　On January 29th, the Liberation Armed Forces continued to thwart the enemy's repeated offensives towards the mountainous area, killing and wounding 47 US and puppet troops, destroying two amphibious armored vehicles, and shooting down three helicopters.
　　After repelling the enemy's repeated offensives, the Liberation Armed Forces actively attacked some enemy camps on January 30th and 31st, killing and wounding dozens of enemy soldiers and shooting down three helicopters.
　　After the enemy's offensive in the mountainous area failed, they turned to "mopping-up" some villages along Highways 17 and 19 on February 1st. After two days of valiant fighting, the Liberation Armed Forces completely thwarted the enemy's "mopping-up" operation, killing and wounding another 112 US and accomplice troops, shooting down two helicopters, and destroying one amphibious armored vehicle.

　　南越解放军猛烈炮轰美国骑一师基地
　　边和省解放武装力量粉碎敌人多次“扫荡”歼敌二百多名
    新华社二十日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量十九日夜用迫击炮猛烈轰击了美国第一骑兵师侵略军在安溪（嘉莱省）基地的营地。
    据西方通讯社报道，炮轰持续了一个小时。“这是（美国）骑兵从去年九月进入阵地以来第一次受到这样的攻击。”“当骑兵师刚到安溪时曾受到狙击的炮火的袭击”。解放军的轰击，使敌人感到慌张。美联社的消息承认，这个营地现在比较空虚，“只有一个旅守卫”。骑兵第一师的另外两个旅正在平定省的蓬山附近进行“扫荡”。有消息说，美国侵略军在“扫荡”中，遭到了解放军的猛烈反击。
    另据报道，解放武装力量在十九日又一次切断了从岘港到顺化的铁路线。约五公里长的铁路线被破坏，铁路运输陷于瘫痪。二十日早晨，解放武装力量还炮轰了西贡西南芹苴省的一个敌军机场和附近的敌军营地，使敌军遭到了伤亡和损失。解放武装力量十九日还爆炸西贡以北十六公里的一个伪军餐厅，炸伤伪军十人。
    新华社河内十九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方边和省解放武装力量从一月二十八日到二月三日，连续挫败敌人多次“扫荡”，共打死打伤美国侵略军和仆从军一百六十五名、伪军五十四名，击落美国直升飞机八架，击毁两栖装甲车三辆，缴获大量武器和弹药。
    据报道，一月二十八日，六千名美国侵略军、仆从军和伪军在一百多架飞机、九十三辆装甲车和二十四艘战船的掩护下，向边和省仁泽县的山林地区进行大规模“扫荡。”美伪军用飞机、大炮对第十七、十九号公路两旁的许多乡村进行狂轰滥炸之后，步兵随着两栖装甲车从隆成市向山林地区进犯，他们在沿途杀人放火，无恶不作。
    当地解放武装力量英勇地迎击了敌人，打退了向福安、福善各乡进犯的美国侵略军，打死打伤敌人数十名，残敌慌忙向原路撤逃。
    一月二十九日，解放武装力量又继续挫败了敌人向山林地区发动的多次进攻，打死打伤美军和仆从军四十七名，击毁两栖装甲车两辆，击落直升飞机三架。
    解放武装力量在击退了敌人的多次进攻之后，一月三十日和三十一日主动袭击敌人一些营地，打死打伤数十名敌军，击落直升飞机三架。
    敌人进攻山林地区失败后，二月一日又转向位于第十七、十九号公路两旁的一些乡村进行“扫荡”。解放武装力量经过两天的英勇战斗，完全挫败了敌人的这次“扫荡”，又打死打伤美军和帮凶军一百一十二名，击落直升飞机两架，击毁两栖装甲车一辆。
