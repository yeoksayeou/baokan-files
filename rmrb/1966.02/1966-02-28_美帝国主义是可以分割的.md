　　U.S. Imperialism Can Be Divided
　　He Jiang
    Everything in the world is divisible. U.S. imperialism, this behemoth, is also divisible. U.S. imperialism is a powerful imperialism. Once it is divided, we can eliminate it piece by piece and devour it bite by bite.

    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Battles can only be fought one battle at a time, and enemies can only be eliminated part by part," "This is called resolving them individually, or militarily, defeating them one by one." This is a brilliant strategic thought for defeating U.S. imperialism, and also a correct tactical principle for defeating U.S. imperialism.

    U.S. imperialism divides itself.

    In order to dominate the world, it places some of its strength in Europe, some in Asia, some in Latin America, and some in the continental United States. Within each continent, it further disperses its forces in various locations, placing a few thousand troops here and positioning a few warships there. In the past, Hitler's Germany, in order to dominate Europe, established a powerful strike force after long preparations. When it launched a war of aggression and scattered its forces throughout Europe, it fell into a state of being divided, unable to cope with the encirclement by the anti-fascist peoples and suffered the fate of destruction. Today's U.S. imperialism, compared to Hitler's Germany, has greater ambitions, more dispersed power, and a more vulnerable strategic position.

    The power of U.S. imperialism is inherently far from sufficient compared to its aggressive ambitions. After its limited power is divided, it becomes even weaker. Moreover, U.S. imperialism can only use a portion of its power to invade a country, while the invaded country can mobilize the strength of its entire people to confront the American aggressors. In this situation, the advantage is not on the side of U.S. imperialism, but on the side of the invaded people.

    The situation in South Vietnam is a most convincing example.

    Although U.S. imperialism has gone to great lengths, dispatching more than 200,000 troops, thousands of aircraft, and hundreds of warships, it still cannot salvage its defeat in the war of aggression against Vietnam. The fundamental reason is that the American invading army is situated in the vast ocean of the people's war in South Vietnam. No matter how U.S. imperialism continues to increase its troops, it will always be limited, and it will always be a minority compared to the fourteen million people of South Vietnam. The predicament of the American aggressors is unchangeable.

    In fact, why wouldn't U.S. imperialism want to use all its forces, come out in full force, to deal with the local point of South Vietnam? It's not that it doesn't want to, it's that it can't.

    This is because the power of U.S. imperialism has already been divided. If the troops occupying the Dominican Republic are withdrawn, the people of the Dominican Republic will make trouble; if the troops occupying South Korea are withdrawn, the U.S. rule in South Korea will become unstable; if the troops stationed in Western Europe are withdrawn, the Western European "allies" will further break away from U.S. control; if the domestic forces in the United States are withdrawn, the American people may "rebel."

    Recently, there has been a lot of bickering within the U.S. ruling clique. Some people complain that the U.S. invading army being trapped in South Vietnam "has caused a weakening of the overall strategic position of the United States," and some worry that continuing to fight in South Vietnam will make it "impossible for the United States to fulfill its obligations elsewhere in the world." It can be seen that although South Vietnam is a local point in U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary global strategy, the people of South Vietnam dividing U.S. imperialism in this local area and hitting it hard, eliminating it bit by bit, greatly weakens U.S. imperialism and further exposes the weak nature of U.S. imperialism.

    From this, it can be seen that, on the one hand, the anti-American struggle of the people of all countries ties the hands and feet of U.S. imperialism, preventing it from going all out to deal with the people of South Vietnam; on the other hand, the people of South Vietnam grab hold of the hundreds of thousands of elite U.S. troops, give them a severe blow, and contain the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism. The people of all countries in the world, you hit its head, I hit its feet. A divided U.S. imperialism is like this, and can be devoured bite by bite.

    Moreover, even within a local area, U.S. imperialism can be further divided. In South Vietnam, the United States has concentrated more than 200,000 invading troops, who are bound to be scattered in various locations, which is a kind of division. In addition, when a U.S. unit arrives in a place, one-third of its strength has to stay behind to guard the home, and it can no longer be moved, which is also a kind of division. Of the remaining forces, some have to undertake supply work. According to the Americans' own statistics, for every combatant, there are two logistics personnel, which is another kind of division. With such a division, the people of South Vietnam can, of course, concentrate superior forces, choose favorable opportunities and favorable locations, and eliminate the American aggressors part by part. In the past year or so, the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces have been wiping out American invading troops by company and battalion, eliminating more than 10,000 of them.

    The aggressive nature and arrogant ambitions of U.S. imperialism determine that it has to divide itself. This is the case on a global scale, and it is also the case in a local area where it is carrying out aggression. We say that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger and can be completely defeated, and one of the reasons for this is here.

### 美帝国主义是可以分割的

　　美帝国主义是可以分割的
　　何江
    世界上的一切事物都是可以分割的。美帝国主义这个庞然大物，也是可以分割的。美帝国主义是一个强大的帝国主义。当它被分割之后，就可以一部分一部分地把它消灭，一口一口地把它吃掉。
    毛泽东同志指出：“打仗只能一仗一仗地打，敌人只能一部分一部分地消灭”，“这叫做各个解决，军事上叫做各个击破。”这是打败美帝国主义的一个光辉战略思想，也是打败美帝国主义的一个正确战术原则。
    美帝国主义是自己把自己分割开来的。
    它为了要独霸世界，在欧洲放一部分力量，在亚洲放一部分力量，在拉丁美洲放一部分力量，在美国本土放一部分力量。在每一个洲中，它又把力量分散在各处，这里放几千军队，那里摆几条军舰。当年希特勒德国为了称霸欧洲，经过长期的准备，建立起一支强大的突击力量。当它发动了侵略战争，把兵力散布在欧洲各处，就陷于被分割的境地，无法对付反法西斯各国人民的围攻而遭到覆灭的命运。今天的美帝国主义比起当年的希特勒，野心更大，力量更加分散，战略地位也更加虚弱。
    美帝国主义的力量，同它的侵略野心比较起来，本来就是远远不足的。它有限的力量被分割以后，就更加削弱了。何况美帝国主义只能使用它的一部分力量来侵略一个国家，而被侵略的国家则可以动员全国人民的力量来对付美国侵略者。在这种情况下，优势就不在美帝国主义方面，而在被侵略的人民方面。
    南越的情况，就是一个最有说服力的例子。
    美帝国主义虽然费尽了九牛二虎之力，出动了二十多万的军队、上千架的飞机和几百艘军舰，依然无法挽救在侵越战争中的败局。根本的原因是因为美国侵略军是处在南越人民战争的汪洋大海中。不管美帝国主义怎样继续增兵，总是有限度的，它比起一千四百万南越人民来总是少数。美国侵略者的困境是无法改变的。
    其实，美帝国主义何尝不想动用它的全部兵力，倾巢出动，来对付南越这个局部地点呢？非不为也，是不能也。
    这是因为，美帝国主义的力量早已经被分割了。把侵占多米尼加的军队抽出来，多米尼加人民就要闹事；把侵占南朝鲜的军队抽出来，美国在南朝鲜的统治就要不稳；把驻扎在西欧的军队抽出来，西欧的“盟国”就要进一步摆脱美国的控制；把美国国内的兵力抽出来，美国人民可能就要“造反”。
    最近，美国统治集团内部吵吵嚷嚷。有人抱怨美国侵略军陷在南越“引起了美国总战略地位的削弱”，有人担心在南越打下去将使美国“无法承担在世界其他地方承担的义务”。可见，虽然南越是美帝国主义反革命全球战略中的一个局部，但是，南越人民把美帝国主义分割在这个局部狠狠地打，一点一点地把它消灭，就大大地削弱了美帝国主义，进一步暴露了美帝国主义的虚弱本质。
    由此可见，一方面各国人民的反美斗争束缚住美帝国主义的手脚，使它不能全力以赴对付南越人民；另一方面，南越人民揪住美国几十万精锐部队，给予狠狠的打击，牵制了美帝国主义的侵略力量。世界各国人民，你打它的头，我打它的脚。一个被分割开来的美帝国主义就是这样，就可以被一口一口地吃掉。
    不仅如此，就在一个局部的地区，美帝国主义也是可以再分割的。在南越，美国集中了二十多万侵略军，他们势必要散布在各处，这就是一种分割。此外，美国一支部队开到一地，三分之一的兵力要看家，再也不能动弹，这也是一种分割。余下的兵力，又有一部分要担任供应工作。据美国人自己统计，一个战斗人员打仗就要两个后勤人员，这又是一种分割。这样一分割，南越人民当然可以集中优势兵力，选择有利时机和有利地点，一部分一部分地消灭美国侵略者。最近一年多来，南越人民武装就是这样把美国侵略军一个连、一个营地加以歼灭，搞掉了它一万多人。
    美帝国主义的侵略本性和它的狂妄野心，决定了它非把自己分割开来不可。在全世界范围是如此，在它进行侵略的一个局部地区也是如此。我们说，美帝国主义是纸老虎，是完全可以打败的，其中一个根据就在这里。
