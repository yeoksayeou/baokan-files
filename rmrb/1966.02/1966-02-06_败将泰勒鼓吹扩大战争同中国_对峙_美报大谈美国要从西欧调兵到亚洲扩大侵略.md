    According to Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 5th: While American newspapers and influential figures are clamoring for further expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, they are also clamoring for a "confrontation" with China.
    Former U.S. "Ambassador" to South Vietnam, Taylor, openly clamored in a speech in New York on the 3rd that the U.S. must "confront" China. He said, "If we shy away from confronting China in Southeast Asia, we will soon find that, as we retreat, the line of contact moves forward."
    At the same time, Taylor expressed strong opposition to the so-called "enclave strategy" put forward by former U.S. Ambassador to France, Gavin, in an attempt to salvage the U.S.'s defeat in South Vietnam.
    He said that the result of adopting this strategy "would confine American ground forces to isolated coastal strongholds and permanently cease bombing strategic targets in North Vietnam." Adopting this strategy "would be tantamount to accepting a serious defeat on an international scale." Taylor trumpeted for further expansion of the war and sending "more troops" to South Vietnam.
    The *New York Herald Tribune* published an article on January 31st, advocating further withdrawal of troops from Western Europe to Asia to meet the U.S.'s military needs in Asia. The article said, "There are good reasons to study how many troops we have stationed in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and order large-scale reductions based on economic, political, and strategic reasons." The article said, "Suggesting that we cut troops is not suggesting that the United States withdraw from Europe. The question is to decide how many troops the United States needs to station in Western Europe 'at a time when the United States is now about to undertake a costly and long-term new military operation in the Far East.'"
    The article pointed out that the reason why the United States can withdraw troops from Western Europe is because Europe is peaceful today. "As long as the United States continues to maintain a reasonable military force (in Europe), the people of Europe can rest easy."

    败将泰勒鼓吹扩大战争同中国“对峙”
    美报大谈美国要从西欧调兵到亚洲扩大侵略
    据新华社五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国报纸和有影响的人物在鼓吹进一步扩大侵越战争的同时，叫嚣要同中国“对峙”。
    美国前驻南越“大使”泰勒三日在纽约发表演说时公然叫嚷，美国要同中国“对峙”。他说，“如果我们躲避在东南亚同中国对峙，我们不久就会发现，随着我们撤退，接触的界线就推进了。”
    泰勒同时表示强烈反对前美国驻法大使加文为了挽救美国在南越的败局而提出的所谓“固守战略”。
    他说，采取这个战略的结果“将使美国地面部队撤到沿海孤立据点，并且永远停止轰炸北越的战略目标”。采取这种战略“等于是接受一个国际规模的严重失败”。泰勒鼓吹进一步扩大战争，派“更多的军队”到南越去。
    《纽约先驱论坛报》一月三十一日刊载一篇文章，鼓吹进一步从西欧抽兵到亚洲，以应付美国在亚洲的军事需要。文章说，“有充分理由来研究我们派驻北大西洋公约组织的部队人数（需要）多少，并根据经济、政治和战略理由下令大加削减。”文章说，“建议我们削减部队不是建议美国从欧洲撤退。问题是要决定在美国现在即将在远东采取耗费巨大的长期的新军事行动的时候”，美国在西欧的驻军需要多少。
    文章指出，美国所以能够从西欧撤出部队，是因为欧洲今天是和平的。“只要美国继续（在欧洲）保持合理的军事力量，欧洲的人们就可以高枕无忧。”
