    Hanoi, February 3 (Xinhua) – The head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army sent an urgent telegram on the 3rd to the Chairman of the International Commission in Vietnam, strongly protesting the bandit-like actions of U.S. aircraft and warships of the Seventh Fleet in attacking the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the 3rd. The telegram stated, "Today, multiple batches of U.S. aircraft, taking off from bases in South Vietnam and Thailand, as well as the Seventh Fleet, successively violated the airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, bombing and strafing residential areas in provinces such as Thanh Hóa and Nghệ An. After the aforementioned attacks were met with fierce retaliation and suffered heavy losses, the United States then dispatched two destroyers from the Seventh Fleet to intrude into the territorial waters of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and indiscriminately shelled residential areas in Nghệ An Province."
    The telegram pointed out, "This is the first time that warships of the Seventh Fleet have blatantly attacked the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in coordination with the bombing by the U.S. Air Force."
    The Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army also sent an urgent telegram to the International Commission in Vietnam on the 3rd, strongly protesting the crimes of U.S. aircraft continuing to bomb and strafe residential areas and economic units in the northern Vietnamese provinces of Thái Bình, Nghệ An, and Hà Tĩnh, as well as Vinh City, on the 2nd.
    Hanoi, February 3 (Xinhua) – It was announced here late on the 3rd that the military and civilians of Nghệ An Province in North Vietnam shot down three intruding U.S. bandit aircraft on the 3rd and captured a group of U.S. pilots.
    In the afternoon of the 3rd, U.S. bandits again dispatched fighter-bombers to barbarously bomb and strafe a residential area in the northern part of Nghệ An Province. The military and civilians of Nghệ An Province, with the determination to eliminate U.S. bandits, fiercely struck the invading enemy aircraft. According to preliminary reports, the heroic military and civilians shot down three U.S. jet aircraft in the first round of fire and captured a group of U.S. pilots.
