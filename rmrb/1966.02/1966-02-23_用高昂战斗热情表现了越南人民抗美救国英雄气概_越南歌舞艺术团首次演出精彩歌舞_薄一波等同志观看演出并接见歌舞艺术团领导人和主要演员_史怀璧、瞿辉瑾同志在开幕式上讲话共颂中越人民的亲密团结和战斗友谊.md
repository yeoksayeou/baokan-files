　　Present at the reception were Kong Yuan, Han Nianlong, Shi Huaibi, Li Qi, Fan Jin, Sun Xiaocun, and Li Wei.

　　Hoang Bac, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, and Le Tung Son, Acting Head of the Permanent Delegation of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front in China, were also present.

　　Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd -- The Song and Dance Troupe of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam gave its premiere performance in China tonight at the Tianqiao Theater in the capital. The Vietnamese literary and art fighters from the front lines of the anti-American struggle used songs and dances full of high fighting enthusiasm to express the heroic image and revolutionary spirit of the Vietnamese people in resisting America and saving the nation on the stage of the Chinese capital, and were warmly welcomed by the audience.

　　Bo Yibo, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, Yang Xiufeng, President of the Supreme People's Court and President of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association, and Kong Yuan, Han Nianlong, Shi Huaibi, Li Qi, Fan Jin, Sun Xiaocun, Li Wei, Lü Ji, Yan Wenjing, Dai Ailian, and other responsible persons of relevant departments, attended and watched the performance.

　　When Vice Premier Bo Yibo and President Yang Xiufeng, together with Qu Huijin, Head of the Vietnamese Song and Dance Troupe, Deputy Heads Pham Dinh Luc and Tuan Jin Ping, Hoang Bac, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, and Le Tung Son, Acting Head of the Permanent Delegation of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front in China, entered the theater, the audience applauded warmly.

　　The performance began with the chorus "The East is Red" and "Ode to Chairman Ho." Against the backdrop of magnificent images of the rivers and mountains of Vietnam, the Vietnamese literary and art fighters performed wonderful songs and dances such as "One Hand Casts the Net, One Hand Holds the Gun," "One Hand Plows, One Hand Holds the Gun," "Under the Banner of the Liberation Front," "Wasp Dance," "Wooden Grenade," "Yankees Deserve It," "Firecracker Song," and "Song of the Anti-Aircraft Sniper." These programs vividly reflected the fearless heroic spirit of the people of North and South Vietnam in the struggle against America and for national salvation, and demonstrated the powerful might of people's war. The Vietnamese artists also enthusiastically performed Chinese and Vietnamese songs and dances such as "Vietnam-China" and "Victory Dance," which praised the militant friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people, as well as vocal programs with Vietnamese national characteristics such as the monochord solo. During the nearly three-hour performance, the theater resounded with enthusiastic applause, and each program was warmly welcomed by the audience in the capital.

　　At the opening ceremony held before the performance, Shi Huaibi, Deputy Director of the Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee, and Qu Huijin, Head of the Vietnamese Song and Dance Troupe, both warmly praised the great militant unity and fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam in their speeches.

　　Shi Huaibi said that the Song and Dance Troupe of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has brought the heroic image of the Vietnamese people in the great struggle against America and for national salvation, which is not only a great encouragement to the Chinese people, but also provides our literary and art workers with another good opportunity to learn. He said that the Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against America and for national salvation. No matter what conspiracies and tricks the American aggressors play, and no matter to what extent they escalate the war, the 650 million Chinese people will always stand firmly with the Vietnamese people and thoroughly defeat American imperialism.

　　Qu Huijin said that we are engaged in a life-and-death battle with the most barbaric imperialist chieftain—American imperialism. Inevitably, we will survive, and inevitably, they will perish. The day that there is still one American devil on our sacred land, we will fight, and keep fighting until they are completely defeated, until they completely abandon the dream of invading our country, and roll up their bedding and go back to the other side of the Pacific. He said that we are not alone; all progressive mankind supports us. Especially on every road of our struggle, the fraternal 650 million Chinese people have always stood with us. This close unity and militant friendship is one of the sources of our powerful strength.

　　After the performance, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, President Yang Xiufeng, and others went on stage to congratulate the Vietnamese artists on their successful performance. Amidst the song "Liberate the South," Chinese literary and art workers presented flowers and flower baskets to the envoys of friendship from the Vietnamese people.

    演出以合唱《东方红》和《歌颂胡主席》开始。在一幕幕映有越南河山的壮丽图景下，越南文艺战士们表演了《一手撒网，一手拿枪》、《一手扶犁，一手拿枪》、《在解放阵线的大旗下》、《蚂蜂战舞》、《木头手榴弹》、《美国佬，活该》、《拉炮歌》、《对空狙击手之歌》等精彩歌舞，这些节目生动反映了越南北方和南方人民在抗美救国斗争中的大无畏的英雄气概，显示了人民战争的强大威力。越南艺术家还热情地表演了《越南—中国》、《祝捷舞》等歌颂中越人民战斗友谊的中越两国歌舞，以及具有越南民族特色的独弦琴独奏等声乐节目。在近三个小时的演出中，剧场响起一阵阵热烈掌声，每个节目都受到首都观众的热情欢迎。
