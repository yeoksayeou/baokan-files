　　Willing to be a Pupil of the Masses
    Through studying Jiao Yulu, I have come to realize that whether one can learn from the masses and be a willing pupil of the masses, and do a good job in investigation and research, is a matter of principle concerning whether one is determined to thoroughly establish a proletarian world view and strengthen Party spirit.
    Comrade Mao Zedong has consistently taught us to go deep into reality, go deep among the masses, and do a good job in investigation and research, pointing out: "No investigation, no right to speak." In order to do a good job in investigation and research, Comrade Mao Zedong also earnestly taught us: we must put down our airs, learn from the masses, and be willing to be pupils of the masses. Comrade Jiao Yulu faithfully implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions. Look, the second day he came to work at the county Party committee, he went to the countryside to investigate the situation. In order to find a way to conquer the "three evils," he talked with an old poor peasant for three days and three nights....
    Using Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror to examine myself, I feel that I have done a very poor job in investigation and research, and the key to this lies in the lack of the spirit of learning from the masses and being a willing pupil of the masses. The geographical conditions of our Jianzha County are relatively complex, with high mountains, steep slopes, deep valleys, and many stones, making transportation very inconvenient. The cadres and masses in the county are eager to build some roads. However, in the past, the leaders of the county Party committee had conservative ideas and did not see the enthusiasm of the masses for building roads. Instead, they emphasized difficulties such as lack of money and technical personnel. Therefore, they have been unable to make a decision. Later, we handed these problems over to the masses for discussion, and a large number of "Zhuge Liangs" appeared. Without technicians, the masses surveyed the routes and set off explosives themselves; without modern earthmoving tools, the masses used carrying poles and carts.... Finally, the difficulties were solved. It was originally planned that it would take two million yuan to build the roads leading to the eleven communes, but now it has only taken ninety thousand yuan. Doesn't this vividly prove the truth that "the masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often naive and ridiculous"?
    In the past, I always thought that because I was born and raised in Jianzha and had a certain level of education and work experience, I assumed that "what the masses know, I must also know." However, objective reality has negated this point. For example, recently the county decided to vigorously develop diversified operations. Some poor and lower-middle peasants suggested that we could plant Da Hong and green peppers, which surprised me because in the past I always thought these things were wild and could not be cultivated. Furthermore, some poor and lower-middle peasants also suggested where fish could be raised in our county, where medicinal materials could be dug, and where minerals could be mined, and who could mine them. I had never heard of these things. After hearing these suggestions from the masses, I truly realized that the truly wise ones are the masses, not myself.
    To learn from the masses and be willing to be a pupil of the masses, we must wage a tenacious struggle against individualism. Through studying Jiao Yulu, I have further realized that whether we can truly do this is a matter of principle concerning whether we are determined to thoroughly establish a proletarian world view and strengthen Party spirit. In the future, I am determined to be like Jiao Yulu, go deep into reality, go deep among the masses, and do a good job in investigation and research.

　　甘当群众的小学生
    通过学习焦裕禄，使我认识到能否做到拜群众为师，甘当群众小学生，搞好调查研究工作，是有没有决心彻底树立无产阶级世界观，增强党性的原则问题
    毛泽东同志一贯教导我们要深入实际、深入群众，做好调查研究工作，指出：“没有调查就没有发言权。”为了做好调查研究工作，毛泽东同志又谆谆教导我们：必须放下架子，拜群众为师，甘当群众的小学生。焦裕禄同志忠实地执行了毛泽东同志的指示。你看，他来县委工作的第二天就下乡摸情况去了，为了寻找征服“三害”的办法，曾和一位老贫农谈了三天三夜……。
    把焦裕禄同志作为一面镜子，来对照检查一下自己，就感到自己平时调查研究工作做得很差，而这里的关键又在于缺乏拜群众为师、甘当群众小学生的精神。我们尖扎县的地理条件比较复杂，山高、坡陡、沟深、石头多，交通十分不便。县上干部和群众都迫切希望修些公路。可是由于过去县委领导有保守思想，没有看到群众有修路的积极性，而是一味强调没有钱，没有技术力量等等困难，因此一直下不了决心。以后我们把这些问题放手交给群众讨论，大批的“诸葛亮”出现了。没有技术员，群众自己勘察线路、放炸药；没有现代化推土工具，群众就用背斗背、车子拉……，终于把困难解决了。原来计划需要用二百万元才能把通向十一个公社的大道修通，现在只用了九万元就办到了。这件事不是生动地证明“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”这条真理吗？
    以往我总认为自己是生在尖扎、长在尖扎，有一定的文化和工作经历，因此自以为“群众知道的事，我也必定知道”。然而，客观实际却否定了这点。例如最近县上决定大力开展多种经营，有些贫下中农提出可以种植代红、青椒，我就感到很惊奇，因为过去我一直认为这些东西是野生的，不能种植。再如，有些贫下中农还提出在我县那个地方可以养鱼，那些地方可以挖到什么药材，那些地方可以开矿，谁会开等等，自己更是闻所未闻。听到群众这些建议后，我才真正认识到真正高明的是群众而不是自己。
    要拜群众为师，甘当群众的小学生，就必须和个人主义作顽强斗争。通过学习焦裕禄，使我进一步认识到能否真正做到这点，是有没有决心彻底树立无产阶级世界观，增强党性的原则问题。今后我决心象焦裕禄那样，深入实际，深入群众，做好调查研究工作。
