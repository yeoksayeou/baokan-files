    The Thai authorities' coveting of Cambodian territory has been a long-standing issue. Since 1956, Thai troops and aircraft, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, have continuously violated Cambodian airspace. According to Thai newspapers, the Thai government even plotted in 1960 to annex the Cambodian border provinces of Koh Kong and Battambang, as well as parts of Kampong Thom and Siem Reap provinces. In 1961, Thailand stationed troops on the border, intimidating and threatening Cambodia, forcing Cambodia to sever diplomatic relations with Thailand on October 24, 1961.

    After 1962, Thailand's violations and provocations against Cambodia increased.

    Since last year, with the expansion of the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, Thailand has acted as a pawn of U.S. imperialism, intensifying its invasion of Cambodia. On August 3, the Thai Prime Minister ordered the closure of the Thai-Cambodian border. Armed incursions have become more frequent. This year, in order to cooperate with U.S. imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression in Indochina, the Thai authorities have dispatched troops to repeatedly invade Cambodian border areas. Another aspect of the Thai authorities' aggression against Cambodia is through so-called "Free Khmer" elements carrying out subversive activities against Cambodia. According to the Cambodian News Agency, on October 26 last year, 900 "Free Khmer" bandits gathered in Surin Province, Thailand, and received modern guns from the U.S.-Thai authorities, preparing to step up their subversive and destructive activities against Cambodia. At the end of last year, this group of "Free Khmer" elements, together with the Thai army, launched a fierce attack on the O Smach post in Oddar Meanchey Province of Cambodia, causing serious casualties and losses to the Cambodian side.

    泰国反动派侵柬罪行
    泰国当局垂涎柬埔寨领土，由来已久。从一九五六年开始，泰国的军队和飞机就在美帝国主义的指使下不断侵犯柬埔寨领空。据泰国报纸透露，泰国政府在一九六○年甚至策划了一项吞并柬埔寨的戈公和马德望两个边境省份，以及磅同省和暹粒省一部分的计划。一九六一年，泰国陈兵边境，对柬埔寨进行恫吓和威胁，迫使柬埔寨于一九六一年十月二十四日宣布与泰国断绝外交关系。
    一九六二年后，泰国对柬埔寨的侵犯和挑衅有加无已。
    去年以来，随着美国侵越战争的扩大，泰国充当美帝走卒，加紧对柬埔寨的侵犯。八月三日，泰国总理下令封锁泰柬边界。武装侵犯活动更加频繁。今年来，泰国当局为配合美帝国主义扩大侵略印度支那战争，出动军队一再侵犯柬埔寨边境地区。泰国当局对柬埔寨侵犯的另一方面是通过所谓“自由高棉”分子对柬埔寨进行阴谋颠覆活动。据柬埔寨新闻社报道，去年十月二十六日，有九百名“自由高棉”匪徒在泰国素辇省集结，接受美国—泰国当局的现代化枪炮，准备加紧对柬埔寨的颠覆和破坏活动。这批“自由高棉”分子，于去年底伙同泰国军队向柬埔寨的奥多棉藏省的奥斯马哨所发动猛烈进攻，造成柬埔寨方面的严重伤亡和损失。
