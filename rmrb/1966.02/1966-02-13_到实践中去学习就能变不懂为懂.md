    Learning originates from practice. Although books can impart knowledge, true understanding is impossible without personal experience. Seeing a vacuum arc furnace in a book is not the same as truly understanding it. What to do? To transform ignorance into understanding, we must follow Chairman Mao's words and participate in the practice of transforming reality.

    Before 1958, although I had studied "On Practice," I was not very willing to participate in production practice activities in factories. I also believed that the task of a teacher was to impart professional knowledge to students with rich teaching content; and the most effective way to have rich teaching content was to sit in the library and read, to read more literature. When reading literature, the scientific research results of others' years of labor could be learned in a few hours or at most a few days. If I went to the factory to learn from practice and do scientific research, the time spent would be a lot, and the results would not necessarily be great. These incorrect ideas had not been thoroughly resolved for many years.

    In the first half of 1965, I led students to Shanghai for graduation work, one topic of which was conducted on a vacuum arc furnace. I only had book knowledge of this kind of furnace, not practical knowledge. What to do? Chairman Mao said: "The only way is to make them participate in practical work and become practical workers, to make those engaged in theoretical work study important practical problems." To follow Chairman Mao's words, we must first solve the problem of our attitude towards learning from worker comrades. At first, I felt that I was a senior teacher, a professor, and the director of the electrometallurgy teaching and research section, and there were still many things I didn't understand here, which was embarrassing. Later, I immediately realized that this was a manifestation of my not having put down my airs and not having the determination to take workers as teachers. I remember Chairman Mao said: "I advise those who only have book knowledge but have not yet come into contact with reality, or those with little practical experience, to understand their shortcomings and adopt a more humble attitude." These teachings of Chairman Mao encouraged me to confide in the worker comrades. I said to the worker comrades: I have only seen the vacuum arc furnace in books, and I have never actually worked with it. Today I am here as an elementary school student, learning from you. The workers immediately helped me enthusiastically, showed me all kinds of equipment without reservation, and even disassembled it for me to see if I couldn't see clearly, and sincerely introduced various experiences in operation. These experiences I had not found in books. Thanks to the enthusiastic help of the worker masters, I quickly mastered a lot of practical knowledge of this new smelting equipment. This was of great benefit to scientific research and guiding students' graduation theses. This incident made me realize that as long as I listen to Chairman Mao's words, I can transform ignorance into understanding. If I put on airs and pretended to understand when I didn't, the result would definitely still be ignorance.

    Through the study of Chairman Mao's works, I have strengthened my practical viewpoint, and I have also paid attention to changing my way of thinking and preventing subjectivism. In teaching work, I have gradually paid attention to improving teaching methods and teaching content, and I have also made some attempts to reform the curriculum system, which has begun to achieve some results. For example, when I taught the ferroalloy course, I used to move the course system of foreign textbooks, lecturing on various iron species in a relatively scattered manner, and listing silicon, manganese, chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, and titanium as seven major categories. Each major category was further divided into several iron species, and each iron species was taught several smelting methods, which was very cumbersome and complicated. As a result, students could not remember it, teachers went over the allotted time, and the effect was not good. Where was the reason? At that time, some people suspected that it was a contradiction between "too much content" and "too few class hours." In order to find out the crux of the problem, implement the teaching principle of "less but refined," and further strengthen the connection between theory and practice, I re-studied Chairman Mao's works on opposing subjectivism, egalitarianism, and decentralism. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, I and the relevant members of the teaching and research section came to the production site to conduct a series of investigations and studies, and decided to change the original complex system based on iron species to a system based on "one theory (namely, the selective reduction theory) and three methods (namely, the electrothermal method, the metallothermic method, and the electro-metallothermic method)," strengthen basic theory, and re-list the composition of the new course. Judging from the trial lectures, the teaching effect is relatively good.

    到实践中去学习就能变不懂为懂
    北京钢铁学院教授　朱觉
    认识来源于实践。尽管书本也可以给人知识，但没有经过亲身实践，是不可能真正领会的。只在书上见过真空自耗炉，不是真正懂得真空自耗炉。怎么办？要想变不懂为懂，就要照毛主席的话去做，去参加变革现实的实践。
    在一九五八年以前，我虽然学习过《实践论》，却不太愿意到工厂中去参加生产实践活动。并且认为：教师的任务就是要以丰富的教学内容，向同学传授专业知识；而要有丰富的教学内容，最有效的办法也就是坐在图书馆里读书，多看文献。看文献时，别人劳动几年的科学研究成果，自己花上几个小时最多几天时间就能学到手了。如果到工厂里去向实际学习，做科学研究，时间花得多，成果不一定大。这些不正确的思想，多年以来自己一直没有得到彻底的解决。
    一九六五年上半年，我带领同学去上海搞结业工作，其中有一个题目是在真空自耗炉上进行的。对这种炉子我只有书本知识，没有实际知识，怎么办呢？毛主席说：“唯一的办法就是使他们参加到实际工作中去，变为实际工作者，使从事理论工作的人去研究重要的实际问题。”要照毛主席的话去做，首先就要解决向工人同志学习的态度问题。开始我觉得自己是老教师、教授、电冶金教研组主任，到这里有好些东西还不懂，不好意思。后来我马上意识到这是自己还没有放下架子，没有拜工人为师的决心的表现。记得毛主席说过：“我劝那些只有书本知识但还没有接触实际的人，或者实际经验尚少的人，应该明白自己的缺点，将自己的态度放谦虚一些。”毛主席的这些教导使我鼓起了勇气去向工人交心交底。我对工人同志说：真空自耗炉我只在书上见过，没有实际搞过，今天到这里来是小学生，向你们学习。工人立即热情地帮助我，毫无保留地带我看各种设备，看不清的，还给我拆开来看，诚恳地介绍操作中的各种经验。这些经验是我在书本上没有找到过的。由于工人师傅的热情帮助，我很快地掌握了这个新的冶炼设备的许多实际知识。对科学研究和指导学生毕业论文的工作都有很大好处。这件事使我认识到，只要听毛主席的话，就能变不懂为懂。如果我摆上架子，不懂装懂，结果一定还是个不懂。
    通过毛主席著作的学习，加强了自己的实践观点，也注意了改变思想方法，防止主观主义。在教学工作上，我逐步地注意改进教学方法和教学内容，而且对课程体系的改革也作了一些尝试，开始收到一些效果。例如，我讲铁合金课时，过去是搬国外教科书的那一套课程体系，比较分散地讲各个铁种，并列硅、锰、铬、钨、钼、钒、钛七大类，每一大类又分若干铁种，每一铁种又讲几种冶炼方法，十分烦琐庞杂，结果是学生记不住，教师超学时，效果不好。原因在哪里？当时有人怀疑是“内容多”和“学时少”的矛盾。为了找出问题的症结，贯彻“少而精”的教学原则，进一步加强理论联系实际，我又重新学习了毛主席的有关反对主观主义、平均主义和分散主义的著作。在毛泽东思想的指导下，我和教研室的有关成员一起来到生产现场，进行了一系列的调查研究，决定将原来的以铁种为纲的庞杂体系，改为以“一个理论（即选择还原理论）三个方法（即电热法、金属热法、电金属热法）”为纲，加强基础理论，重列组成新课程。经过试讲的情况来看，教学效果比较好。
