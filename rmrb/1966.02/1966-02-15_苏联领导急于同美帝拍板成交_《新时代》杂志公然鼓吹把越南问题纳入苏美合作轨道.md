    Xinhua News Agency, February 14th: Just as U.S. imperialism is stepping up its expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the Soviet press is vigorously promoting that "the key to solving the most acute and urgent problems can be found at the negotiating table."

    The sixth issue of the Soviet magazine "New Times," published on February 4th, featured an article by Berezhkov entitled "The Responsibility of the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee." The article said, "The events of recent months have once again confirmed an undeniable truth: in our era, relying on brute force, relying on weapons—no matter how powerful—cannot solve problems that have matured. The key to solving the most acute and urgent problems can be found at the negotiating table. Vietnam and Tashkent symbolize two diametrically opposed approaches in international affairs. And everyone should be clear: which of these two approaches is in the interest of mankind."

    The article begins by hypocritically criticizing the United States for "gradual escalation" in Vietnam, but it quickly shifts its focus to colluding with the United States to conclude a "treaty to prevent nuclear proliferation." The article states, "The gradual escalation of the U.S. war of aggression against the Vietnamese people, the interference of imperialist countries in the internal affairs of other countries, and the connivance with West German revanchists who are trying to get their hands on nuclear weapons—all of this has dangerously sharpened the international situation. Therefore, it is more important than ever to take effective steps towards easing tensions, stopping the harmful arms race, and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons." The article concludes, "The current intensification of the international situation, of course, cannot but leave its mark on the activities of the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee. But on the other hand, it is precisely this intensification that places a greater responsibility on the countries participating in the committee, requiring them to unswervingly seek solutions to the most important disarmament issues for the fate of mankind. This is what the people of all countries expect from the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee." (Attached picture)

### 苏联领导急于同美帝拍板成交  《新时代》杂志公然鼓吹把越南问题纳入苏美合作轨道

    苏联领导急于同美帝拍板成交
    《新时代》杂志公然鼓吹把越南问题纳入苏美合作轨道
    新华社十四日讯　正当美帝国主义在加紧扩大侵越战争的时候，苏联报刊却在大肆宣传“解决最尖锐和最迫切问题的关键，能在谈判桌上找到。”
    二月四日出版的苏联《新时代》杂志第六期上，刊登了别列日科夫撰写的一篇题为《十八国裁军委员会的责任》的文章。文章说，“近几个月来的事件又一次证实了一个无容置辩的真理：在我们的时代，依靠粗暴的力量，依靠武器——不论它多么厉害——都不能解决已经成熟的问题。而解决最尖锐和最迫切问题的关键，能在谈判桌上找到。越南和塔什干象征着国际事务中目前两个截然相反的方针。而每个人都应该清楚：这两个方针里哪一个符合人类利益。”
    文章在开头假惺惺地指责美国在越南搞“逐步升级”，但是，它笔锋一转，马上把它的落脚点放在勾结美国缔结“防止核扩散”条约上面。文章说，
  “美国对越南人民的侵略战争的逐步升级、帝国主义国家干涉别国内政、纵容力图染指核武器的西德复仇主义者——所有这一切都使国际局势危险地尖锐化了。所以，现在朝缓和紧张局势方面采取有效步骤，停止有害的军备竞赛，不允许扩散核武器，比任何时候都要重要。”文章最后说，“目前国际局势的尖锐化，当然不能不对十八国裁军委员会的活动留下痕迹。可是从另一方面来看，正是这种尖锐化就使参加委员会工作的各个国家负有更大的责任，要求它们百折不挠地寻求解决对人类命运最重要的裁军问题的办法。各国人民期待于十八国裁军委员会的也就是这一点。”（附图片）
