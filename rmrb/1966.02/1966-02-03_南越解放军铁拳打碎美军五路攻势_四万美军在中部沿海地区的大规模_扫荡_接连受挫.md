    Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd dispatch, Saigon: The five-pronged offensive recently launched by 40,000 American invading troops in the central coastal region of South Vietnam and near Saigon has been thwarted by the courageous and resourceful counterattacks of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army.
    According to Western news agencies, the so-called "Masher Offensive" launched by the US 1st Cavalry Division in Bình Định Province suffered setbacks from the start. When troops of this division landed by helicopter near Phù Cát on January 28th and 29th, they were repeatedly bombarded by the Liberation Army's artillery fire. On these two days alone, more than twenty American helicopters were shot down or damaged. On January 31st, the Liberation Army again bombarded the American troops near Phù Cát with fierce artillery fire. The enemy's position was in chaos. The South Vietnamese puppet troops, who were "mopping up" along with the US troops, even opened fire on the US troops in panic, causing casualties. It was reported that on this day, when two battalions of the US 1st Cavalry Division fought fiercely with the Liberation Army near An Thái village, "two US companies suffered heavy losses."
    The so-called "Double Eagle Offensive" launched by more than 5,000 US Marines in the coastal area of Quảng Ngãi Province has repeatedly failed since it began on January 28th, as it could not find the resourceful and flexible main force of the Liberation Army. It was reported that these American invading troops "have already stayed in the area north of the 'Masher Offensive'" on February 1st.
    The so-called "Mattress Offensive" launched by the US 1st Infantry Division on January 28th southeast of Saigon has also been very unsuccessful. Western news agencies reported that on February 1st, US troops were "held up by the Liberation Army's 'vast network of tunnels and wooden houses'" eighteen kilometers east of Saigon. Southwest of Saigon, the Liberation Army attacked a company of the US 1st Infantry Division on the 2nd, and they also heavily damaged another company of this division twenty-three kilometers southeast of Saigon.
    The so-called "Cedar Falls Offensive" launched by another unit of the US 1st Infantry Division northwest of Saigon had to be declared over on January 31st due to constant failures.
    The US 101st Airborne Division and South Korean mercenary troops, who launched the so-called "Van Buren Offensive" in Phú Yên Province, have also been constantly attacked by the Liberation Army in recent days, suffering heavy casualties.

    南越解放军铁拳打碎美军五路攻势
    四万美军在中部沿海地区的大规模“扫荡”接连受挫
    新华社二日讯　西贡消息：四万名美国侵略军最近在南越中部沿海地区和西贡附近发动的五路攻势，在越南南方解放军的英勇和机智的反击下，纷纷挫败。
    据西方通讯社报道，由美国第一骑兵师在平定省发动的所谓“捣碎机攻势”，一开始就受到挫折。这个师的部队一月二十八日和二十九日乘直升飞机在蓬山附近着陆时，连遭解放军炮火的轰击。单是这两天，美国直升飞机就被打落打伤二十多架。一月三十一日，解放军又用猛烈的炮火轰击了蓬山附近的美军。敌军阵地一片混乱。随同美军一起“扫荡”的南越伪军在慌乱中竟向美军开火，造成了伤亡。据报道，这一天，美国第一骑兵师的两个营在安太村附近同解放军激战时，“有两个美军连受到了惨重损失”。
    由五千多名美国海军陆战队在广义省沿海地区发动的所谓“双鹰攻势”，从一月二十八日开始以来，因找不到机智灵活的解放军主力，连连扑空。据报道，这批美国侵略军在二月一日“已经停留在‘捣碎机攻势’以北地区”。
    由美国第一步兵师一月二十八日在西贡东南发动的所谓“木槌攻势”，也很不顺利。西方通讯社的消息说，美军二月一日在西贡以东十八公里地方，已经被解放军的“庞大的地道网和木屋拖住了”。在西贡西南，解放军二日袭击了美国第一步兵师的一个连，他们还在西贡东南二十三公里的地方重创这个师的另一个连。
    由美国第一步兵师的另一支部队在西贡西北发动的所谓“鹿皮攻势”，由于不断扑空，已经不得不在一月三十一日宣告结束。
    在富安省发动所谓“范布伦攻势”的美国第一○一空降师和南朝鲜帮凶军，连日来也不断受到解放军的痛击，伤亡累累。
