    Asian, African, and Latin American Public Denounce Johnson Administration's New War Adventure
    (Comprehensive report by this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: The Johnson administration's blatant announcement of resuming bombing operations in North Vietnam has sparked strong opposition from people around the world, who are unanimously condemning the U.S. imperialism's crimes of further expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. They are also exposing the U.S. attempt to use the United Nations to interfere in the Vietnam issue, to cover up U.S. aggression against Vietnam, and pointing out that the United Nations has no right to discuss the Vietnam issue.
    The Afro-Asian-Latin American People's Solidarity Organization statement said:
    U.S. Imperialism Never Intended to Stop Aggression
    The Afro-Asian-Latin American People's Solidarity Organization held a press conference on the 1st and issued a statement, saying that the U.S. resumption of bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "clearly confirms the hypocrisy of the Johnson administration's so-called 'peace offensive'. This is the best proof of the hypocrisy and treachery of the U.S. rulers."
    The statement said: "In reality, U.S. imperialism has never intended to stop its aggression against the Vietnamese people. The measures taken in recent days are included in its plan to 'gradually escalate' the war."
    The statement pointed out that the U.S. request to convene the United Nations Security Council to discuss the Vietnam issue is to "re-enact the tragedy of the Congolese people, where the 'blue helmets', under the banner of the United Nations, committed heinous crimes against the heroic people of Patrice Lumumba."
    Korean "Rodong Sinmun" said:
    The United States Wants to Use the United Nations to Cover Up the Expansion of the War
    The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 2nd, saying that the resumption of bombing exposes that the "seeking peace" loudly trumpeted by the U.S. imperialists is merely a trick used to deceive world public opinion and cover up the conspiracy to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The editorial strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' vicious conspiracy to use the "United Nations" to continue their war adventures and deceive world public opinion. The editorial pointed out that this is the U.S. imperialism's attempt to shift all its guilt onto the Vietnamese people, to use the "United Nations" to achieve its aggressive goals, and to legitimize its new criminal activities.
    Yoshitaro Hirano, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, said:
    The United Nations Is Not Qualified to Discuss the Vietnam Issue
    Yoshitaro Hirano, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, said in a statement on the 2nd that the U.S. imperialists are now resuming the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam while attempting to use the United Nations Security Council to cover up their aggressive behavior. However, Japanese public opinion believes that the United Nations is not qualified to discuss the Vietnam issue, and any resolutions passed by the United Nations are invalid.
    Michio Iwamura, Director of the Japan Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, said, "The U.S. resumption of bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam further exposes that the so-called 'suspension of bombing' and 'peace offensive' that the United States started at the end of last year are completely a hoax, and it exposes that it wants to continue down the road of expanding the Vietnam War."
    Iwamura condemned the U.S. for manipulating the United Nations in a "peace talks" conspiracy and pointed out that the United Nations is not qualified to interfere in the Vietnam issue.
      "Cambodia Telegraph" said:
      No Illusions Can Be Had About the Likes of Johnson
    The "Cambodia Telegraph" published an editorial on the 2nd, condemning the U.S. resumption of bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, saying: "Now, of course, no illusions can be had about the likes of Johnson and his advisors being restrained. It is better to think of the worst. It can almost be asserted that this group of adventurers, inheriting Hitler's mantle, is clearly prepared to stake everything on a single throw."
    The editorial said: "Johnson has realized that the farce he orchestrated with great fanfare, called the 'peace offensive' to deceive people, has not achieved its purpose, and no one has been deceived."
    The editorial pointed out that the decision to resume bombing was made at the same time that 40,000 American troops launched an unprecedented military offensive in South Vietnam in five routes, "and Washington denies that it is 'gradually escalating' (the war of aggression in South Vietnam), which indisputably shows that the imperialists on the other side of the Pacific are in a politically embarrassing situation."
    Syrian "Al-Ba'ath" said:
    The United States Continues to Engage in "Peace Offensive" in the United Nations
    The Syrian "Al-Ba'ath" published an editorial on the 1st, saying that the U.S. continuing to bomb the Democratic Republic of Vietnam shows that the U.S. is persisting in aggression. The U.S. wants the United Nations Security Council to intervene in the Vietnam issue as part of Johnson's "peace offensive."
    The newspaper pointed out that Johnson's "peace offensive" is nothing more than a smokescreen to continue and prolong the war of aggression. Progressive and anti-imperialist forces all over the world support the Vietnamese people in opposing the United States' peace talks conspiracy. The newspaper called on people of all countries, including the American people, to support the Vietnamese people against Washington's aggression.
   The Secretary-General of the Supreme Revolutionary Council of Congo (Leopoldville) said:
    Resumption of Bombing Proves the Failure of the U.S. Peace Talks Deception
    Youmbu, Secretary-General of the Supreme Revolutionary Council of Congo (Leopoldville), told a Xinhua News Agency reporter on the 1st: "The U.S. resumption of air strikes against North Vietnam shows that its fundamentally hypocritical so-called peace movement has suffered a complete failure." He then pointed out that "suspending bombing," for the U.S., was only to enable it to step up preparations to expand its war of aggression in Vietnam and Indochina.
    Algerian News Agency said:
    The United States' Intensified Aggression Arouses Condemnation from People of All Countries
    The Algerian News Agency condemned the U.S. government's new diplomatic conspiracy to convene the United Nations Security Council to discuss the Vietnam issue on the 1st, saying it was shameless to the extreme.
    The news agency emphasized that the U.S. government's real intention is to use this cunning method to cover up its crimes of aggression against Vietnam.
    The Algerian News Agency warned the Johnson administration: "This blatant trick will only further arouse the condemnation and ridicule of peace-loving people of all countries against U.S. imperialism and its evil intentions, and will only strengthen the support of the people of all countries for the Vietnamese people."
      Tanzanian "Nationalist" said:
      Failure to Condemn the United States Is a Failure to Fulfill Our Responsibilities
    The Tanzanian "Nationalist" published an editorial on the 2nd, saying: "The U.S. resumption of bombing of North Vietnam has been universally condemned around the world."
    The editorial said: "We also protest." "Africa is waging a struggle to eliminate the remnants of colonialism and foreign rule from our continent, but if we do not condemn the current actions of the United States in North Vietnam, then we have failed to fulfill our responsibilities."
    The editorial called on African freedom fighters to "learn from the Vietnamese spirit of determination to resist foreign rule."
    Costa Rican public figure Aguiluz said:
    U.S. Resumption of Bombing Is Blatant Aggression
    Marcial Aguiluz, Chairman of the Costa Rican Socialist People's Alliance Party and former parliamentarian, said, "The United States bombing from the air a sovereign people thousands of nautical miles away from the United States is undoubtedly blatant aggression by the United States."
    The Costa Rican Socialist Youth League distributed leaflets condemning the U.S. resumption of bombing of North Vietnam and expansion of the war of aggression in Vietnam. The Costa Rican Women's League also issued a statement condemning the U.S. pirate-like, murderous, and yet cowardly bombing of villages and cities in North Vietnam. The statement also called on the American people to rise up and seize the murderous claws of the murderers.

    亚非拉公众斥约翰逊政府扩大战争新冒险
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：约翰逊政府悍然宣布轰炸越南北方的战争行动，激起了世界各国人民强烈反对，一致声讨美帝国主义进一步扩大侵越战争罪行，并揭露美国企图利用联合国插手越南问题，掩盖美国侵略越南的罪责，指出联合国根本无权讨论越南问题。
    三大洲声援越南人民委员会声明说
    美帝国主义从未打算停止侵略
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲声援越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略斗争委员会一日在记者招待会上发表一项声明说，美国恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸“清楚地证实了约翰逊政府的所谓‘和平攻势’的虚伪性，这是美国执政者的伪善和奸诈的最好证明”。
    声明说：“实际上，美帝国主义从来没有打算停止对越南人民的侵略，最近几天采取的措施是包括在它的使战争‘逐步升级’的计划之内的。”
    声明指出，美国要求召开联合国安全理事会讨论越南问题是要“重演刚果（利）人民的悲剧，在那里，‘蓝盔军’在联合国的旗帜下对帕特里西奥·卢蒙巴的英雄人民犯下了莫大的罪行”。
    朝鲜《劳动新闻》说
    美国想利用联合国掩盖扩大战争
    朝鲜《劳动新闻》二日发表社论说，恢复轰炸暴露出美帝国主义者大肆叫嚷的“寻求和平”只不过是用来欺骗世界舆论和掩盖扩大侵略越南战争的阴谋的骗局。
    社论强烈谴责美帝国主义企图利用“联合国”来继续进行战争冒险和欺骗世界舆论的恶毒阴谋。社论指出，这是美帝国主义妄图把它的一切罪过都转嫁给越南人民，妄图利用“联合国”来达到它的侵略目的，使它的新的罪恶活动合法化。
    日本和委会会长平野义太郎说
    联合国没有资格讨论越南问题
    日本和平委员会会长平野义太郎二日发表谈话说，美帝国主义现在一面恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸，一面企图利用联合国安全理事会，来掩饰它的侵略行为。但是，日本的公众舆论认为联合国没有资格讨论越南问题，不管联合国通过什么决议，都是无效的。
    日本亚非团结委员会理事岩村三千夫说，“美国恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸，进一步暴露了美国从去年年底开始的所谓‘停止轰炸’和‘和平攻势’完全是个骗局，并且暴露了它要在扩大越南战争的道路上走下去”。
    岩村谴责美国操纵联合国搞“和谈”阴谋，并且指出联合国根本没有资格插手越南问题。
      《柬埔寨电讯报》说
      不能对约翰逊之流抱任何幻想
    《柬埔寨电讯报》二日发表社论，谴责美国恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸说：“现在当然不能对约翰逊之流及其顾问会有所收敛抱任何幻想。宁可朝最坏的方面着想。几乎可以断定，承袭了希特勒的衣钵的这个冒险家集团显然准备孤注一掷。”
    社论说：“约翰逊已经意识到，他大张旗鼓导演的为了骗人而叫作‘和平攻势’的丑剧并没有达到目的，谁也没有受骗。”
    社论指出，这次恢复轰炸的决定是在四万名美国军队同时在南越分五路发动空前规模的军事进攻的时候作出的，“而华盛顿却抵赖它（在侵略南越的战争中）‘逐步升级’，这就无可争辩地表明了太平洋彼岸的帝国主义者在政治上处境尴尬。”
    叙利亚《复兴报》说
    美国在联合国继续搞“和平攻势”
    叙利亚《复兴报》一日发表社论说，美国继续轰炸越南民主共和国表明美国坚持侵略。美国要联合国安理会干涉越南问题，是约翰逊“和平攻势”的一部分。
    这家报纸指出，约翰逊的“和平攻势”只不过是继续和拖延侵略战争的烟幕。全世界进步和反帝力量都支持越南人民反对美国的和谈阴谋。报纸呼吁包括美国人民在内的各国人民支持越南人民反对华盛顿的侵略。
   刚果（利）革命最高委员会总书记说
    恢复轰炸证明美国和谈骗局失败
    刚果（利）革命最高委员会总书记尤姆布一日对新华社记者发表谈话说：“美国恢复空袭北越表明，它的根本是伪善的所谓和平运动遭到了彻底失败。”他接着指出，“暂停轰炸”，对美国来说，只是为了使它能够加紧准备在越南和印度支那扩大侵略战争。
    阿尔及利亚新闻社说
    美国加紧侵略激起各国人民谴责
    阿尔及利亚新闻社一日谴责美国政府为召开联合国安全理事会讨论越南问题进行新的外交阴谋活动真是无耻到了极点。
    这家新闻社强调指出：美国政府真正的企图，是用这种狡猾手法，来掩盖它侵略越南的罪行。
    阿尔及利亚新闻社警告约翰逊政府说：“这种明目张胆的诡计只会更加引起爱好和平的各国人民对美国帝国主义和它的罪恶企图的谴责和嘲笑，只会使各国人民加强对越南人民的支援。”
      坦桑尼亚《民族主义者报》说
      不谴责美国就没有尽到职责
    坦桑尼亚《民族主义者报》二日发表社论说：“美国恢复轰炸越南北方受到了全世界的普遍谴责。”
    社论说：“我们也提出抗议”。“非洲正在进行从我们大陆清除殖民主义和外国统治残余势力的斗争，但是如果我们不谴责美国目前在越南北方的行动，那就是没有尽到我们的职责。”
    社论号召非洲的自由战士“学习越南决心反抗外国统治的这种精神”。
    哥斯达黎加公众领袖阿吉卢斯说
    美国恢复轰炸是明目张胆的侵略
    哥斯达黎加社会主义人民联盟党主席、前议员马西亚尔·阿吉卢斯说，“美国从空中轰炸一个离美国数千海里的拥有主权的人民，这无疑是美国明目张胆的侵略”。
    哥斯达黎加社会主义青年联盟散发传单，谴责美国恢复轰炸越南北方和扩大在越南的侵略战争。哥斯达黎加妇女联盟也发表声明，谴责美国对越南北方的乡村和城市进行海盗式的、杀人不眨眼的、然而也是卑怯的轰炸。声明还呼吁美国人民起来抓住杀人犯的魔爪。
