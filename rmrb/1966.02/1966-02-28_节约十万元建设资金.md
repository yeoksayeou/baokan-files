　　In 1954, Jiao Yulu was responsible for leading the construction of a temporary highway. In his work, he cherished state property and often told his comrades that our country is a poor country, and he wanted his comrades to pay attention to diligence and frugality in everything.
    Before the construction of this highway, a plan was drafted. According to the design requirements, the bottom layer of the highway should be paved with 15 centimeters of gravel, and the surface layer should be paved with 12 centimeters of gravel. After consideration, Jiao Yulu said to the technicians: "We are building a temporary highway, which will only be used in the initial stage of the factory construction, and will not be needed after one or two years. Is it possible to reduce the thickness of the road surface? You must know that the money spent on this temporary highway alone is equal to the public grain handed over by several counties in a year!"
    After hearing his words, the comrades present were all moved by his spirit of considering the people wholeheartedly and saving for the country in everything. Later, after careful study by several site technicians, they all agreed that Comrade Jiao Yulu's opinion was good, so they decided to adopt his suggestion and make the road surface thinner.
    As a result, this one time alone saved the state 100,000 yuan in construction funds.

　　节约十万元建设资金
    一九五四年，焦裕禄负责领导修筑一条临时公路。在工作中，他很珍惜国家的财产，经常对同志们讲，我们国家是个穷的国家，要同志们处处注意勤俭节约。
    修筑这条公路前，曾拟定了一个方案，按设计要求，公路底层要铺十五厘米厚的石子，面层要铺十二厘米厚的石子。焦裕禄经过考虑后，对技术人员说：“我们修的是一条临时公路，只在建厂初期使用，一两年后就不用了，是不是可以将路面的厚度减薄一些？要知道，光这一条临时公路所花的钱，就等于几个县一年所交的公粮啊！”
    在场的几个同志听了他的话之后，都不禁为他那种设身处地为人民着想，处处为国家节约的精神所感动。后来，经过几个工地技术人员仔细研究，都认为焦裕禄同志的意见提得好，便决定采纳他的意见，把路面铺薄一些。
    结果，仅这一次就为国家节约了十万元的建设资金。
