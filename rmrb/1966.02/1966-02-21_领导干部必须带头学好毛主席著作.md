　　Leading Cadres Must Take the Lead in Studying Chairman Mao's Works
    Beijing Municipal Party Committee's experience exchange meeting emphasized: First, profoundly recognize the great significance of highlighting proletarian politics and using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything; create a lively and vigorous political situation, grasp living ideas; and make great efforts in the "use" aspect.
    (Xinhua News Agency, February 20) The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a meeting to exchange experiences in highlighting politics and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and established a number of advanced models for studying Chairman Mao's works at the meeting. This meeting has prompted leading cadres in all aspects of the city to further realize that they must "study at every level, grasp at every level, and lead at every level" in order to carry out the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works more broadly, deeply, solidly, and persistently.
    More than 1,000 representatives of advanced units and activists who creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works from all fronts of the city, as well as more than 400 responsible cadres from various units' leading cadres, political departments, and propaganda departments, participated in this Beijing experience exchange meeting on studying Chairman Mao's works. The meeting lasted for nine days and concluded today.
    At this meeting, representatives of thirty-one advanced collectives and individuals introduced their experiences in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Their common characteristics are: resolutely listening to Chairman Mao's words, studying Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind during the three great revolutionary movements, and applying what they learn without any discount. In particular, their revolutionary spirit of daring to consciously engage in revolution and daring to fight against the "I" character is very enlightening. Many vivid facts show that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are both fearless and the most intelligent and capable. Such people can be invincible in whatever they do. They can withstand and stand firm in the storms of class struggle, work vigorously, continuously invent and create in technological revolution, grow more grain in farming, and climb to the world's peaks in scientific research.
    This meeting also showed that Mao Zedong Thought has blossomed and borne fruit in the minds and work of the vast number of cadres and masses in Beijing, and a great situation has emerged in the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works throughout the city. However, on the whole, the leadership still lags behind the masses. Many leading cadres do not have a high level of consciousness in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, they do not study well, and some have not seriously applied what they have learned. Some leading cadres compared themselves with advanced experiences at the meeting, found gaps, and investigated the reasons. They believed that the main reason was that they did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of highlighting politics and creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and they had ideas such as arrogance, complacency, and self-imposed restrictions. At the same time, the leadership methods have not been improved, they do not know how to come from the masses, go to the masses, concentrate, persist, especially do not know how to grasp typical examples, break through one point, and promote the overall situation, so the work is busy, chaotic, passive, unable to go deep, and unable to study well. Everyone believes that in order to carry out the mass movement of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works more broadly, deeply, solidly, and persistently throughout the city, leading cadres must take the lead in studying, study at every level, and grasp at every level, in order to bring everyone along.
    To achieve this, we must first profoundly recognize the great strategic significance of highlighting politics and creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and solve the problem of why we should highlight politics and use politics to command professional work. Every leading cadre, whether you are conscious of it or not, has to face every day the question of serving which class, leading with what thought, leading the team to what path, and leading with what method. If proletarian politics is not highlighted in these issues, bourgeois politics will be highlighted. Therefore, we must highlight proletarian politics and use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. Otherwise, it is a violation of the laws of development of socialist society, forgetting class struggle, and impurity of Party spirit. Therefore, the principle of treating Chairman Mao's books as the highest instruction for all work is particularly important for leading cadres. If you do not understand this principle, do not think about it every day, and do not do it every day, you will fall behind and take the wrong path. After listening to the experiences introduced by representatives of advanced units and advanced figures at the meeting, many leading cadres deeply felt that the situation was pressing, and the young generals were challenging them. On the one hand, they were happy that the revolutionary successors were growing up so rapidly, and on the other hand, they were determined to catch up. They said that the older the cadres are, the more energetic they should be, the stronger their Party spirit should be, and the more they should highlight politics and take the lead in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.
    Many typical experiences at the meeting proved that grasping living ideas is the only way to truly highlight politics. Grasping living ideas means grasping special contradictions, which is the combination of theory and practice. If you do not grasp living ideas, highlighting politics becomes empty talk, which is the great enemy of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.
    Regarding how to grasp living ideas, everyone believes that we must have revolutionary determination, dare to promote democracy, dare to expose contradictions, dare to shake off our own ideological burdens, and seriously carry out criticism and self-criticism. We must listen to good words, bad words, correct words, and wrong words. With a lively and vigorous political situation that has both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom, and both unified will and personal ease of mind, we can grasp living ideas in a timely and accurate manner. We must also go deep into the masses with deep class feelings, participate in labor, and conduct serious investigation and research; we must dare to practice and throw ourselves into the most difficult struggles.
    To grasp living ideas, we must grasp the fundamental ones. Only by grasping the contradiction between the two classes, the two roads, and the two ideologies can we grasp the living ones. We cannot only grasp the details of life. Living ideas exist every day and in everything, so we must grasp them every day and in everything.
    Everyone discussed why we should make great efforts in the "use" aspect. Through discussion, everyone deeply realized that it is because there are still classes and class struggle, there are still differences between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between mental and manual labor, and there are still imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in the international arena. To thoroughly revolutionize, it is impossible without making great efforts in the "use" aspect. Li Fenglan, a twenty-two-year-old educated youth who returned to her hometown in the Hongxing Commune of Daxing County, was able to withstand various unhealthy tendencies and did not bow her head in the face of difficulties and did not give up even when she encountered setbacks in order to adhere to the socialist road and safeguard the collective interests, unafraid of the threats and blows of bad elements. The deeds she introduced at the meeting proved that if you do not make great efforts in the "use" aspect, it is impossible to defeat the old forces, and you will retreat in the face of difficulties. Xu Baosheng, an old professor at Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, introduced that in climbing the world's scientific and technological peaks, he encountered various objections from some people who superstitiously believed in "foreign frameworks," saying that he was "adventurous," "wasteful," and violated the principle of "building the country with diligence and thrift." In the face of these objections, some of the people who were doing research with him retreated and stopped doing it. At one time, only two or three people were left. He armed himself with Mao Zedong Thought, adhered to the correct direction, dared to struggle, and dared to practice, and finally conquered the cutting edge of science and technology. If he had not made great efforts in the "use" aspect, he would have been unable to withstand it long ago. Therefore, to be a thorough revolutionary and a thorough dialectical materialist, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to transform ourselves, eliminate selfish ideas and impurities, and not engage in metaphysics and sophistry. Without breaking old ideas, old concepts, and old traditions, new ideas, new concepts, and new traditions cannot be established. In short, we must be like Jiao Yulu, engaging in revolution for a lifetime, studying Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, and making great efforts in the "use" aspect for a lifetime.
    The meeting emphasized that Party committees at all levels must put leading the study of Chairman Mao's works in the first place of leading work, earnestly grasp it, grasp living ideas, grasp the "use" aspect, grasp typical examples, grasp time arrangements, grasp inspections, and grasp cadres taking the lead, and truly achieve "studying at every level, grasping at every level, and leading at every level," discussing it several times a year, so that highlighting politics and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works are truly implemented.
    Everyone who participated in the meeting felt that this meeting was a powerful impetus to further highlighting politics and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the future, and will further promote the great leap forward in Beijing's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

### 领导干部必须带头学好毛主席著作

　　更广泛、深入、扎实、持久地推进群众性学习运动的关键：
　　领导干部必须带头学好毛主席著作
    北京市委召开的学习经验交流会强调：首先要深刻认识突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切的伟大意义；要造成生动活泼的政治局面，抓好活思想；要在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    据新华社二十日讯　中共北京市委最近召开会议交流突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作的经验，并在会上树立了一批学习毛主席著作的先进典型。这次会议促使全市各方面的领导干部进一步认识到，必须“头头学、头头抓、头头带”，才能把学习毛主席著作的群众运动更广泛、更深入、更扎实、更持久地开展起来。
    参加这次北京市学习毛主席著作经验交流会的，有全市各条战线活学活用毛主席著作的先进单位代表和积极分子一千多人，有各单位的领导干部和政治部门、宣传部门的负责干部四百多人。会议开了九天，已在今天闭幕。
    在这次会上，有三十一个先进集体的代表和个人介绍了他们活学活用毛主席著作的经验。他们的共同特点是：坚决听毛主席的话，在三大革命运动中，带着问题学毛主席著作，学了就用，决不打折扣。特别是他们敢于自觉革命，敢于和“我”字作斗争的革命精神，对人启发很大。许多生动的事实说明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，既是大无畏的人，又是最聪明能干的人。这样的人，干什么都可以战无不胜。在阶级斗争的风浪里能够顶得住、站得稳，干工作能够干得生气勃勃，搞技术革命能够不断发明创造，种庄稼能够多打粮食，搞科学研究能够攀登世界高峰。
    这次会议还表明，毛泽东思想已经在北京市广大干部和群众的思想上、工作上开花结果，出现了全市学习毛主席著作群众运动的大好形势。但是，从总的来看，领导还落后于群众。不少领导干部活学活用毛主席著作的自觉性还不高，还学得不好，有的学了还没有认真用。有些领导干部在会上对照先进经验，找差距，查原因，认为主要是由于对突出政治、活学活用毛泽东思想的意义认识不够，存在着骄傲自满、故步自封等思想。同时，领导方法没有改进，不会从群众中来，到群众中去，集中起来，坚持下去，特别是不会抓住典型，突破一点，推动全局，因而工作忙乱被动，不能深入，也不能很好地学习。大家认为，要把全市活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动更广泛、更深入、更扎实、更持久地开展起来，领导干部必须带头学，头头学、头头抓，才能把大家带起来。
    要做到这一点，首先要深刻认识突出政治，活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大战略意义，要解决为什么突出政治、以政治统帅业务的问题。每个领导干部，不管你自觉不自觉，天天都要碰到为哪个阶级服务，用什么思想领导，把队伍带到什么道路上去，用什么方法来领导的问题。在这些问题上，不突出无产阶级政治，资产阶级政治就会突出出来。因此，必须突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。否则，就是违反社会主义社会的发展规律，就是忘了阶级斗争，就是党性不纯。因此，把毛主席的书当做各项工作的最高指示这一原则，对领导干部来说特别重要。不了解这个原则，不天天想，天天做，就要落后，就要走错路。听了会上先进单位代表和先进人物介绍的经验，许多领导干部深深感到，形势逼上来了，小将们在挑战了。他们一方面为革命接班人这样迅速地成长起来而感到高兴，一方面下决心要赶上前去。他们说，干部越老，应该干劲越充沛，党性越强，越要突出政治，带头活学活用毛主席著作。
    会上的许多典型经验证明，抓住活思想，才能真正突出政治。抓活思想，就是抓特殊矛盾，就是理论和实际相结合。不抓活思想，突出政治就成为一句空话，这是活学活用毛主席著作的大敌。
    关于怎样抓好活思想，大家认为，要有革命决心，敢于发扬民主，敢于揭露矛盾，敢于把自己的思想包袱抖落开来，认真地开展批评与自我批评，好话，坏话，正确的话，错误的话，都要听。有了一个既有集中又有民主，既有纪律又有自由，既有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅的生动活泼的政治局面，就能够及时而又准确地抓住活思想。还要带着深厚的阶级感情深入群众，参加劳动，认真地进行调查研究；要勇于实践，投身到最困难的斗争中去。
    抓活思想，要抓根本性的，只有抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两种思想的矛盾，才能抓活。不能只抓生活细节。活思想天天有，事事有，就要天天抓，事事抓。
    大家讨论了在“用”字上下功夫为什么要“狠”的问题。通过讨论，大家深刻地体会到，就是因为还有阶级和阶级斗争，还存在城乡差别、工农差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，国际上还有帝国主义、修正主义和反动派。要彻底革命，不在“用”字上狠下功夫是不行的。大兴县红星公社二十二岁的回乡女知识青年李凤兰，为了坚持社会主义道路，维护集体利益，不怕坏分子的威胁和打击，能够顶得住各种歪风邪气，在困难面前不低头，碰了钉子不卷刃。她在会上介绍的事迹证明，在“用”字上下功夫，非狠不行，不狠，就斗不倒旧势力，不狠，自己就会在困难面前退下来。北京钢铁学院老教授徐宝升介绍他在攀登世界科学技术高峰中，遭到了一些迷信“洋框框”的人的种种反对，说他是“冒险”，是“浪费”，是违反“勤俭建国”方针。在这些反对意见面前，和他一起搞研究的人，有的打退堂鼓不干了，一度只剩下两三个人。他用毛泽东思想武装自己，坚持正确的方向，勇于斗争，勇于实践，终于攻下了科学技术的尖端。要是他在“用”字上下功夫不狠，他也早就顶不住了。所以，要做一个彻底的革命派、彻底的辩证唯物主义者，就必须狠狠地用毛泽东思想改造自己，去掉私心杂念，不搞形而上学和烦琐哲学。不破旧思想、旧观念、旧传统，新思想、新观念、新传统就立不起来。总之，要象焦裕禄那样，干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下一辈子功夫。
    会议强调，各级党委必须把领导毛主席著作的学习放在领导工作的第一位，认真地抓，抓活思想，抓“用”字，抓典型，抓时间安排，抓检查，抓干部带头，真正做到“头头学、头头抓、头头带”，一年讨论几次，使突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作真正落实。
    参加会议的人都感到，这次会议对今后进一步突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，是一个有力的推动，并将进一步促进北京市的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业大踏步前进。
