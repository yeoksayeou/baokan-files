    He Does Whatever Chairman Mao Says
    Zhou Xilu, Secretary of the CCP Kaifeng County Committee
    Chairman Mao said: "We must learn economic work from all experts (no matter who they are). We must take them as our teachers, learn from them respectfully and honestly. If we don't understand, we don't understand; don't pretend to understand." Comrade Jiao Yulu was a model in acting according to Chairman Mao's teaching.
    In 1953, our country began large-scale economic construction, and Comrade Jiao Yulu and I transferred from the agricultural front to work at the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant. Soon after, the factory sent both of us to the Dalian Crane Machinery Plant to study in order to train technical management personnel.
    When we arrived in Dalian, we were stunned when we entered the factory and saw those tall machines, unable to even name them. Someone told us that to understand industrial production knowledge, we must study geometry, algebra, physics, chemistry, etc., and also have practical knowledge. Faced with difficulties, Comrade Jiao Yulu, who did not have a high level of education, was not intimidated. One day during lunch, he said to me: "Buddy, from now on, we must work hard to learn from old workers, technicians, and everyone who understands technology! The sooner we master the technology, the sooner we can contribute to the country's socialist construction. The Party sent us here to study, and we must not let the Party down!"
    From that moment on, Comrade Jiao Yulu studied diligently and was good at learning. He devoted the mornings to cultural studies and technical theory, getting up every day at five o'clock. He studied while relating it to practice, sometimes using real objects for comparison. When he encountered problems he didn't understand, he pondered them carefully or wrote them down, and during the day he went to the factory to ask the old workers. When learning blueprint design, he didn't have the equipment at home, so he used teacups and pencils as "projections" for practice, again and again, night after night, until he understood the principles. During working hours, he often stood beside the lathe, concentrating on watching the old workers operate, learning techniques from them. He promptly asked questions about areas he didn't understand. He also often used his spare time before and after meals to ask workers for advice. As a result, he often missed dinner and didn't get home until late at night, feeling hungry.
    What Comrade Jiao Yulu called "watching movies" had already begun at that time. The so-called "watching movies" meant thinking about what he had learned during the day in relation to practice in the evening, digesting it, and consolidating it. He did this every day, so the knowledge he learned was very solid.
    When we first entered the factory, we didn't understand that there were many types of steel. One night, he asked an old worker for advice, and the old worker taught him how to identify steel. From then on, after work, he took small pieces of steel and ground them on a grinding wheel, learning to distinguish the types of steel from the flying sparks. Soon, he mastered this technique.
    Through hard study, Comrade Jiao Yulu quickly understood the basic theories and production knowledge of various technologies. He could read general blueprints and knew the production methods of many kinds of parts. Half a year later, at the Dalian Crane Machinery Plant, he was relatively skilled in undertaking the leadership of a workshop's production.

    毛主席怎么说他就怎么做
    中共开封县委书记　周锡禄
    毛主席说：“我们必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作。拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。不懂就是不懂，不要装懂。”焦裕禄同志是按照毛主席的这一教导办事的模范。
    一九五三年，我国开始了大规模的经济建设，我和焦裕禄同志先后从农业战线上转到洛阳矿山机器厂工作。不久，厂里为培养技术管理人才，又派我们俩一道到大连起重机器厂去学习。
    我们到大连，一进厂，看着那一台台高大的机器连个名字都叫不出来，这下可把我们愣住了。有人告诉我们，要懂得工业生产知识，必须学习几何、代数、物理、化学等等，还必须有实际知识。在困难面前，文化程度不高的焦裕禄同志没有被吓倒。一天吃午饭的时候，他对我说：“伙计，今后咱们可得下劲向老工人、技术员，向一切懂技术的人学习呀！我们早一天掌握技术，就可以早一天给国家的社会主义建设贡献力量。党派我们来学习，我们决不能辜负党的期望！”
    焦裕禄同志从此刻苦地学习，而且善于学习。他把文化学习和技术理论学习放在早晨，每天五点多钟就起床，他一边看书，一边联系实际，有时候还用一些实物比划着。碰到不懂的问题，他就仔细琢磨，或者记下来，白天到工厂向老工人请教。在学习图纸设计的时候，家里没有设备，他就拿茶缸、铅笔作“投影”练习，一次又一次，一夜又一夜，直到把道理弄明白为止。在上班时间，他常常站在车床一旁，专心致志地看老工人操作，从中学习技术。发现自己不懂的地方就及时发问。他还经常利用饭前饭后的空闲时间，向工人们请教。为此，他曾经多次吃不上晚饭，一直饿到深夜才回家。
    焦裕禄同志所说的“过电影”，在那时已经开始了。所谓“过电影”，就是把白天学过的东西到晚上再联系实际想一想，消化消化，巩固起来。他每天都是这样做的，因此学得的知识非常扎实。
    刚进厂的时候，我们都不懂得钢有许多种类。一天夜里，他向一位老工人请教，老工人把识别钢材的方法教给他。自此以后，下了班他就拿小钢材块在砂轮上磨，从飞溅的火花中学习分辨钢的种类。不久，他就掌握了这种技术。
    经过刻苦地学习，焦裕禄同志很快地懂得了各种技术的基本理论和生产知识。他能看一般图纸，并且知道很多种零件的生产方法。半年以后，他在大连起重机器厂就比较熟练地担负起一个车间生产的领导工作了。
