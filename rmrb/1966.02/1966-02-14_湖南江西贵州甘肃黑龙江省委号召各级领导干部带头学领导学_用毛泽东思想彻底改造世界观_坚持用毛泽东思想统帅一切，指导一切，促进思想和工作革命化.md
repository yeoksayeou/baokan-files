    Hunan
    (Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, February 10th) The Hunan Provincial Party Committee recently issued instructions on deeply developing the movement to study Chairman Mao’s writings, stating that this year, the study of party member leading cadres at the county level and above in Hunan Province should focus on solving the problem of worldview, emphasizing the study of Mao Zedong Thought in the following five aspects: Establishing a communist worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people of China and the people of the world; learning to use the one-divides-into-two viewpoint to observe and handle problems, overcoming subjective one-sidedness, correctly distinguishing and handling two types of contradictions, and mobilizing all positive factors; adhering to seeking truth from facts, investigation and research, the mass line, understanding the principle of matter transforming into consciousness and consciousness transforming into matter, understanding the importance of emphasizing politics and adhering to the four firsts; understanding the theory of class, class struggle, adhering to taking class struggle as the key link, taking the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads as the key link, and actively carrying out the three great revolutionary movements; holding high the banner of the general line of socialist construction, and striving to develop industrial and agricultural production and to achieve exceeding the "National Program for Agricultural Development" as soon as possible.
    The instructions pointed out that it is necessary to immediately launch a major discussion on the relationship between politics and professional work throughout the province, first among leading cadres at the county level and above, and to establish the firm viewpoint of using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything and guide everything.
    Jiangxi
    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 12th) The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee recently made a decision, calling on cadres at the county level and above to take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's writings well and to play an exemplary role in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings.
    The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee emphasized in its decision that Chairman Mao's books should be regarded as the highest instructions for all work. Any tendency to neglect politics, any eclecticism towards emphasizing politics, and any view that places politics on an equal footing with production, politics with technology, and politics with professional work are all wrong. Leading organs and leading cadres at all levels throughout the province must earnestly solve the problem of emphasizing politics and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all work and command all work.
    The decision stated that in studying Chairman Mao’s writings, we must adhere to the principle of integrating theory with practice, earnestly read books, creatively study and apply them, make great efforts in the application of "use," and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our own thinking and improve various tasks.
    Guizhou
    (Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, February 12th) The Guizhou Provincial Party Committee recently pointed out in a notice requiring cadres at the county level and above to earnestly study Chairman Mao's writings that adhering to using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything in all work and promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking is the fundamental guarantee for our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction cause to advance from victory to victory. The notice emphasized the need to continue to raise the awareness of cadres, especially leading cadres at the county level and above, of emphasizing politics and to truly put the creative study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place of all work.
    The notice pointed out that to firmly grasp the study of leading cadres at the county level and above, it is necessary to first have "leadership grasp, grasp leadership," and leading cadres should take the lead; secondly, to grasp what problems are brought about in the study, implement them, and closely supervise and inspect them; and thirdly, to grasp typical experiences, establish models, drive the general, and promptly arrange, inspect, and summarize the study of Chairman Mao's writings.
    Gansu
    (Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, February 13th) The Gansu Provincial Party Committee recently issued a decision, requiring leading cadres at the county level and above to earnestly study Chairman Mao's writings and put leading the study of Chairman Mao's writings in the first place of all work. At the same time, it requires first secretaries of party committees at all levels to lead by example, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's writings, first transform their own subjective world, and regard leading the study of Chairman Mao's writings as the highest responsibility for realizing political leadership.
    The decision stated that in study, we must first use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our own subjective world. Anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought must be resolutely discarded. Those who only regard themselves as transforming others and do not touch their own thoughts at all are not truly learning but falsely learning and are fundamentally violating Mao Zedong Thought, and must be opposed. Second, to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide work is to use the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot at the "target" of the three great revolutionary movements. In the three great revolutionary movements, anything that conforms to Mao Zedong Thought should be supported, praised, promoted, and adhered to; anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought should be exposed, resisted, opposed, and resolutely not done. Third, use Mao Zedong Thought to inspect work, summarize experiences, improve leadership style and leadership methods, and improve the level.
    Heilongjiang
    (Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 13th) The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee recently held an enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee, calling on leading party member cadres at all levels throughout the province to take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings well, to push the movement of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings by the vast number of cadres and masses in the province to a new upsurge, and to better carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction cause throughout the province.
    The meeting pointed out that the movement to study Chairman Mao's writings is developing widely and deeply in both rural and urban areas throughout Heilongjiang Province. A large number of facts prove that we are beginning to enter a brand-new era in which the working people directly grasp theory. Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly becoming a sharp weapon for the broad masses to carry out class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. The more they study Chairman Mao's writings, the higher their class consciousness, the greater their revolutionary enthusiasm, the stronger the political atmosphere, and the better their work.
    The meeting emphasized that leading cadres at all levels, especially cadres at the county level and above, should take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings well, and according to Chairman Mao's instructions, constantly study, transform their thinking, go deep into the grassroots, go deep among the masses, and effectively improve their leadership style and work methods.

    湖南
    据新华社长沙十日电　中共湖南省委最近作出关于深入开展学习毛主席著作运动的指示中指出，今年湖南省县以上党员领导干部的学习应以解决世界观问题为中心，着重从以下五个方面学习毛泽东思想：树立全心全意为我国人民服务，为世界人民服务的共产主义世界观；学会运用一分为二的观点来观察和处理问题，克服主观片面性，正确区分和处理两类矛盾，调动一切积极因素；坚持实事求是，调查研究，群众路线，了解物质变精神、精神变物质的原理，懂得突出政治，坚持四个第一的重要性；懂得关于阶级、阶级斗争的理论，坚持以阶级斗争为纲，以社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争为纲，积极开展三大革命运动；高举社会主义建设总路线的旗帜，为发展工农业生产，为尽早实现超“全国农业发展纲要”而斗争。
    指示指出，必须立即在全省范围内、首先在县以上的领导干部中，开展一次政治与业务的关系的大讨论，树立坚定不移地用毛泽东思想统帅一切、指导一切的观点。江西
    据新华社南昌十二日电　中共江西省委最近作出决定，号召县以上干部带头学好毛主席著作，在活学活用毛主席著作中起模范作用。
    江西省委在决定中强调要把毛主席的书当作一切工作的最高指示。任何忽视政治的偏向，对于突出政治采取折衷主义，把政治与生产、政治与技术、政治与业务平列起来的观点，都是错误的。全省各级领导机关和领导干部，必须认真解决突出政治的问题，用毛泽东思想来指导一切工作，统帅一切工作。
    决定说，学习毛主席著作，必须坚持理论联系实际的原则，要认真读书，要活学活用，在“用”字上狠下功夫，用毛泽东思想来改造自己的思想和改进各项工作。
    贵州
    据新华社贵阳十二日电　中共贵州省委最近在一项要求县以上干部认真学好毛主席著作的通知中指出，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅，促进人的思想革命化，是我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业从胜利走向胜利的根本保证。通知中强调要继续提高干部首先是县以上领导干部对突出政治的认识，切实把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位。
    通知指出，把县以上领导干部的学习狠狠抓起来，首先要“领导抓，抓领导”，领导干部要带好头；其次要抓学习中带什么问题，落实下来，并抓紧督促检查；三是抓典型经验，树立样板，带动一般，并且及时布置、检查、总结对毛主席著作的学习。

    决定说，在学习中，首先要用毛泽东思想来改造自己的主观世界。凡是不符合毛泽东思想的东西，都必须坚决地抛弃。那种专门以改造别人自居，丝毫不触及自己思想的人，不是真学而是假学，是根本违背毛泽东思想的，必须反对。第二，要用毛泽东思想指导工作，就是要用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射三大革命运动之“的”，在三大革命运动中，一切符合毛泽东思想的东西，就支持，就表扬，就推广，就坚持地去办；一切不符合毛泽东思想的东西，就揭露，就抵制，就反对，就坚决不办。第三，要用毛泽东思想检查工作，总结经验，改进领导作风和领导方法，提高水平。

    会议强调各级领导干部特别是县以上干部要带头学好用好毛主席著作，要根据毛主席的指示，不断学习，改造思想；深入基层、深入群众，切实改进领导作风和工作方法。
