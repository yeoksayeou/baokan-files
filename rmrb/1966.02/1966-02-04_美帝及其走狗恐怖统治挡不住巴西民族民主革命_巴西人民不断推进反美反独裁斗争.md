    Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, 3rd—News: Since the reactionary military coup launched by the United States in Brazil in April 1964, the Johnson government, through the Branco puppet regime it fostered, has carried out blatant exploitation and tyrannical rule over the Brazilian nation. However, for more than a year, the Brazilian people, with their glorious tradition of struggle, have increasingly recognized the hideous face of American imperialism. Fearless of violence, they are continuously advancing the anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggle.

    Last September, in Belo Horizonte, one of Brazil's largest cities and the capital of Minas Gerais state, the American consulate was damaged by a bomb. Students at the University of Minas Gerais in this city expelled two special agents sent by the U.S. State Department to the university last August. Anti-American slogans posted by the students on campus read: "Yankees, go home!" In response to the Brazilian authorities' collaboration with the United States in sending troops to suppress the Dominican people's patriotic and just struggle and the terrorist policies of persecuting Brazilian cultural figures, thousands of university students in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have staged protests and strikes on several occasions.

    Brazilian university professors, well-known journalists, writers, poets, lawyers, artists, and architects have joined the ranks of the anti-American, anti-dictatorial mass struggle. From March to November of last year, a large number of well-known intellectuals in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo jointly issued declarations and statements, and held rallies and demonstrations on six occasions, condemning the Branco government's policies of national betrayal and bloody suppression. More than a thousand people were involved in these actions. In mid-March of last year, hundreds of intellectuals with domestic renown in Rio de Janeiro jointly issued a declaration to the nation, strongly condemning all actions restricting democratic freedoms, condemning the dictatorship's violence, abuse, and cultural terrorist policies, and exposing all political and economic measures that violated national interests.

    The declaration pointed out that "the Brazilian nation cannot survive in intolerable oppression," and it called on all Brazilians and all political forces to fight for the full restoration of democratic freedoms and human rights. Despite being beaten and arrested by reactionary military police, the signatories of the declaration gathered in downtown Rio de Janeiro to distribute the declaration. Signatories to this declaration included Oscar Niemeyer, the famous Brazilian architect and chief designer of the new Brazilian capital, Brasilia, Elio de Almeida, the famous engineer and president of the Brazilian National Association of Engineers, and Danton Jobim, the famous journalist and president of the Última Hora newspaper.

    In mid-November of last year, dozens of well-known journalists, poets, and former ambassadors held a demonstration in front of the venue of the "Second Special Meeting of the OAS Foreign Ministers" in Rio de Janeiro, holding up banners protesting the holding of the meeting and shouting slogans such as "Down with the dictatorship" and "We want freedom." This demonstration caused a strong reaction in Latin America and gave a resounding slap in the face to the American authorities, who flaunted "Free Brazil." The military police authorities arrested eight demonstrators, but the response to this atrocity was a series of rallies and statements by patriotic people, launching a struggle to support the arrested. On November 22 of last year alone, more than 700 professors, stage and film artists, journalists, and visual artists gathered at the Maria Della Costa Theater in São Paulo and issued a statement in support of the eight arrested. Brazilian newspapers believe that this was the largest anti-dictatorial demonstration organized by Brazilian intellectuals in nearly twenty years.

    Ignoring the authorities' decree prohibiting strikes and various repressive measures, the working masses persisted in fighting to defend their right to live. In mid-September of last year, 100,000 metallurgical workers in Rio de Janeiro held a major strike demanding a 120 percent wage increase, which was a major blow to the economic policies of the dictatorial government.

    The intensification of the anti-dictatorial struggle was particularly manifested in the nationwide shock caused by the attack by anti-dictatorial armed forces in southern Brazil on two cities in Rio Grande do Sul state last March. At that time, armed patriots seized the government army's ammunition and occupied the local radio station, and called on the radio to launch an anti-dictatorial uprising.

    The pro-American dictatorial regime is rejected by people from all walks of life in Brazil. This was concentrated in the mayoral election in São Paulo last March and the gubernatorial election in eleven states, including Guanabara State, in October. The candidates nominated by opposition parties, supported by former Brazilian presidents Quadros and Kubitschek, received the support of a majority of voters and won in most districts. The pro-American coup forces suffered a crushing defeat.

    The rule of the United States and its lackeys in Brazil is arousing strong resistance from people from all walks of life in Brazil. Even The New York Herald Tribune had to admit in a commentary on the Brazilian political situation last October that "this kind of system" like Brazil's at present "will not last long."

    美帝及其走狗恐怖统治挡不住巴西民族民主革命
    巴西人民不断推进反美反独裁斗争
    新华社三日讯　里约热内卢消息：自从一九六四年四月美国在巴西发动反动军事政变以来，约翰逊政府通过它一手扶植上台的布朗库傀儡政权，对巴西民族进行了露骨的压榨和蛮横的统治。但是一年多来，有着光荣斗争传统的巴西人民越来越认清了美帝国主义的狰狞面貌，他们不畏强暴，正在不断推进反美反独裁的斗争浪潮。
    去年九月，在巴西最大的城市之一、米纳斯吉拉斯州首府贝洛奥里藏特市，美国领事馆被人用炸弹破坏；这个城市的米纳斯吉拉斯大学的学生，在去年八月间把美国国务院派到大学去的两个特务撵了出去。学生们在校园里张贴的反美标语写着：“美国佬，滚回去！”针对巴西当局为美国作帮凶、派兵参加镇压多米尼加人民爱国正义斗争和迫害巴西文化界人士的恐怖政策，圣保罗和里约热内卢数千名大学生先后多次举行了抗议罢课。
    巴西的大学教授、著名记者、作家、诗人、律师、艺术家和建筑学家们加入了反美、反独裁的群众斗争行列。去年三月至十一月，里约热内卢和圣保罗的大批著名知识分子先后六次联名发表宣言和声明，举行集会和示威，谴责布朗库政府丧权辱国、血腥镇压的政策。卷入这些行动的达一千人以上。里约热内卢上百名在国内享有盛名的知识分子曾经在去年三月中旬联名向全国发表一项宣言，其中强烈谴责限制民主自由的种种行动，谴责独裁政权的暴力、虐待、文化恐怖政策，并且揭露了违反民族利益的一切政治和经济措施。
    这项宣言指出，“巴西民族不能生存在不可容忍和压迫中”，它呼吁全体巴西人和一切政治力量为完全恢复民主自由和人权而斗争。尽管遭到反动军警的殴打和逮捕，宣言的签名者带着宣言在里约热内卢市中心集会散发。在这个宣言上签名的有巴西著名的建筑师、巴西新首都巴西利亚的总设计师奥斯卡·尼梅尔，著名工程师、巴西全国工程师协会主席埃利乌·德阿尔梅达，著名记者、《最后一点钟》报社长丹顿·若比姆等。
    去年十一月中旬，几十名著名记者、诗人和大使级前外交官等在里约热内卢“泛美外长第二次特别会议”会场门前举行示威，手举标语，抗议举行这次会议，并且高呼“打倒独裁”、“我们要自由”等口号。这次示威在拉丁美洲引起了强烈的反应，给了标榜“自由巴西”的美国当局一记响亮的耳光。军事警察当局逮捕了八名示威者，但是回答这一暴行的是广大爱国人士连续举行集会，发表声明，掀起了声援被捕者的斗争。仅仅在去年十一月二十二日，在圣保罗就有七百多名教授、舞台和电影艺术家、记者、造型艺术家等在玛丽亚·德拉·柯斯达剧院集会并发表声明，声援这八名被捕者。巴西报纸认为，这是近二十年来巴西知识分子组织的最大的一次反独裁示威集会。
    工人群众不顾当局禁止罢工的法令和种种镇压措施，坚持为保卫生活权利而斗争。去年九月中旬，里约热内卢十万冶金工人举行大罢工，要求增加工资百分之一百二十，这是对独裁政府经济政策的重大打击。
    反独裁斗争的激化特别表现在去年三月巴西南部反独裁武装力量袭击南里约格朗德州两个城市的震动巴西全国的事件上。当时武装爱国者夺取了政府军的军火弹药，占领了地方电台，并且通过电台号召发动反独裁暴动。
    亲美独裁政权遭到巴西各阶层人民的唾弃。这集中反映在去年三月圣保罗市市长选举和十月瓜纳巴拉州等十一个州州长选举运动中。得到巴西前总统夸德罗斯和库比契克支持的、由反对党派提出的候选人受到大多数选民的支持，在多数选区获胜。亲美政变势力遭到惨败。
    美国及其走狗在巴西的统治正在激起巴西各阶层人士的强烈反抗。连《纽约先驱论坛报》在去年十月关于巴西政局的一篇评论中也不得不承认：象巴西目前“这类制度是不会延长很久的。”
