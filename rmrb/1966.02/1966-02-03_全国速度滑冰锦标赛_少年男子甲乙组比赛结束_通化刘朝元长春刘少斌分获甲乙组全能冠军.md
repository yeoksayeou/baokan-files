    (Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, February 2nd) The 1966 National Speed Skating Championships for Junior Men's Group A and Group B concluded today. When the Group A 10,000-meter and Group B 5,000-meter races began this afternoon, heavy snow was falling, affecting the creation of good results. However, the young athletes persevered with great spirit. As a result, the total score of Liu Chaoyuan, a fifteen-year-old from Tonghua City, Jilin Province, who won the all-around championship in Group A, was still higher than the total score of the all-around champion of this group in last year's National Speed Skating Championships. Liu Shaobin, a fourteen-year-old from Changchun, won the all-around championship in Group B.
    The competitions for Junior Men's Group A and Group B both started yesterday. The results of the top three finishers in the 500-meter race for Group A, the top five in the 1,500-meter race, the top seven in the 5,000-meter race, and the top seven in the 500-meter race for Group B, and the top five in the 1,500-meter race, all exceeded the results of the first place in these five events in last year's National Speed Skating Championships.
    Liu Chaoyuan, the all-around champion of Junior Men's Group A, was participating in a national competition for the first time. His technique was well-executed. In the individual events, he won first place in the 5,000-meter race (with a time of 8 minutes 37.3 seconds, surpassing last year's national first-place time of 9.2 seconds and approaching the 8 minutes 30 seconds mark for a master athlete), second place in the 10,000-meter race (19 minutes 13.5 seconds), fourth place in the 500-meter race (47.5 seconds), and fifth place in the 1,500-meter race (2 minutes 30.7 seconds). As a result, his total all-around score reached 207.138 points, while last year's national champion's total score was 208.540 points (the lower the total score, the better the result). Zhao Weichang from Changchun took second place in the all-around with 209.766 points. Su Guobin from Harbin took third place in the all-around with 209.861 points. He also won first place in the 10,000-meter race (19 minutes 7.1 seconds).
    Liu Shaobin, the all-around champion of Junior Men's Group B, only achieved fourth place in the all-around of Junior Men's Group B at last year's National Speed Skating Championships with a score of 229.129 points. This time, he also won first place in the 1,500-meter race (with a time of 2 minutes 34.8 seconds; last year's national first-place time was 2 minutes 39.2 seconds), first place in the 5,000-meter race (11 minutes 19 seconds), as well as fourth place in the 500-meter race (49.3 seconds) and fifth place in the 3,000-meter race (5 minutes 34.6 seconds). His total all-around score was 224.566 points, which was an improvement over last year.

    据新华社吉林二日电　一九六六年全国速度滑冰锦标赛少年男子甲组和乙组的比赛今天结束。今天下午开始进行甲组一万米和乙组五千米的比赛时，大雪纷飞，影响创造好成绩，但是少年选手们以顽强的精神坚持参加比赛。结果，甲组全能冠军、吉林省通化市十五岁的刘朝元的总分，仍然比去年全国速度滑冰锦标赛这个组全能冠军的总分有了提高。长春十四岁的刘少斌获得了乙组的全能冠军。
    少年男子甲组和乙组的比赛都是从昨天开始的。获得甲组五百米前三名、一千五百米前五名、五千米前七名和乙组五百米前七名、一千五百米前五名的选手的成绩，都超过了去年全国速度滑冰锦标赛这五个项目第一名的成绩。
    获得少年男子甲组全能冠军的刘朝元是第一次参加全国性比赛。他的技术发挥得比较好，在单项比赛中获得了五千米的第一名（成绩八分三十七秒三，超过去年这项全国第一名九分二秒三的成绩，接近八分三十秒的运动健将标准）、一万米的第二名（十九分十三秒五）、五百米的第四名（四十七秒五）和一千五百米的第五名（二分三十秒七）。结果，全能总分达到了二○七点一三八分，而去年这项全国冠军的总分是二○八点五四○分（总分越少成绩越好）。长春的赵伟昌以二○九点七六六分获得全能第二名。哈尔滨的苏国斌以二○九点八六一分获得全能第三名，他还获得一万米的第一名（十九分七秒一）。
    少年男子乙组全能冠军刘少斌在去年全国速度滑冰锦标赛上，只以二二九点一二九分获得少年男子乙组的全能第四名。这次，他还获得了一千五百米的第一名（成绩二分三十四秒八，去年这项全国第一名的成绩是二分三十九秒二）、五千米的第一名（十一分十九秒），以及五百米的第四名（四十九秒三）和三千米的第五名（五分三十四秒六）。他的全能总分是二二四点五六六分，比去年有了提高。
    哈尔滨的梁万财（二二四点七二六分）、延边朝鲜族自治州的南昌岛（二二八点○六六分）分别获全能第二、第三名。
