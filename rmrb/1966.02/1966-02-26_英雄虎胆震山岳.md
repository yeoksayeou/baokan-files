　　Heroic Courage Shakes the Mountains
    One day, Nguyen Van Troi's combat squad was ordered to defend a hilltop next to the Ka Tun "strategic hamlet" on Highway 19. The American invading army was fiercely launching an attack on this hill. Their artillery bombarded the hilltop madly, and forty enemy planes recklessly poured down bombs like raindrops. Napalm bombs burned fiercely from all directions.
      "Let the enemy get closer, open fire when they are five meters away!" Nguyen Van Troi told the squad leader, then slung his gun over his back and quickly ran along the trench to the front.
    A battalion of American soldiers climbed towards the hilltop. Only five meters away, Nguyen Van Troi suddenly stood up, raised his gun, and pulled the trigger. All the comrades in the squad fired at the same time. The two leading platoons of American soldiers were all hit and fell to the ground. The ghosts who were lucky enough to survive dropped their guns and crawled and rolled on the ground, fleeing towards the foot of the mountain. Soon, enemy planes swooped down again and threw bombs wildly at the hilltop. Nguyen Van Troi encouraged his comrades, saying: "We must fight heroically like the martyr Nguyen Van Troi! Everyone must conserve ammunition as much as possible and persevere to the end. Submachine guns must be fired when the enemy is five meters away, rifles must be fitted with bayonets, and hand grenades must be twisted open and thrown accurately!"
    The enemy planes dropped bombs, followed by a large number of napalm bombs, and the entire hilltop was on fire. The soldiers in Nguyen Van Troi's squad were all burned by the napalm. Only Nguyen Van Troi himself was not hit because he was close to the enemy. After the enemy planes bombed, the frightened American soldiers climbed towards the hilltop again. When the enemy got close, the brave warriors unexpectedly gave them a head-on blow again. The enemy immediately retreated again.
    After the enemy retreated to the foot of the mountain, Nguyen Van Troi quickly turned back, carried the wounded comrades into the fortifications, bandaged their wounds, and then gathered all the guns of the wounded soldiers in front of him, digging new fortifications while monitoring the enemy.
    After regaining their composure, the enemy concentrated their forces and launched a final attack. In front of Nguyen Van Troi, hundreds of American soldiers, like fierce beasts, climbed towards the hilltop. Now, only Nguyen Van Troi was left to fight the enemy.
    The enemy soldiers climbed up in two wings. Nguyen Van Troi calmly waited for them to enter the firing range before unexpectedly opening fire again. He first strafed the right side, then the left side. Relying on their large number, the enemy continued to shout and climb upwards. Nguyen Van Troi was wounded for the first time. At this time, the submachine gun ammunition was exhausted, so he picked up a rifle to fight. Then, he was wounded a second and third time, but he still gritted his teeth and fired at one enemy after another. The rifle ammunition was exhausted again, so he picked up a hand grenade and continued to fight. Finally, he had only one hand grenade left in his hand.
    Nguyen Van Troi picked up all the weapons that had no ammunition left, smashed them with all his might, and then held the last grenade in his arms. He waited...
    The enemy soldiers, who had been beaten into a panic, waited for a long time, and seeing no movement on the hilltop, they howled and climbed up again. But no one dared to walk in front. They huddled together, fifty meters, still no gunfire, thirty meters, still no gunfire, ten meters. Suddenly, a People's Liberation Army fighter, covered in blood, stood up from a newly dug fortification. It was Nguyen Van Troi. The enemy was stunned and wanted to escape. But it was too late. Nguyen Van Troi quickly jumped out of the fortification, like an arrow, straight into the chaotic enemy ranks. Then, with a loud "boom!", the entire hilltop shook.
    After the thick smoke dissipated, dozens of enemy corpses were lying scattered on the ground.
    Although Nguyen Van Troi heroically sacrificed himself, he and his comrades turned this hilltop into an inviolable fortress!

　　英雄虎胆震山岳
    阮文诺的战斗小组一天奉命去守卫第十九号公路卡屯“战略村”旁的一个山头。美国侵略军正在气势汹汹地向这个山丘发动进攻。他们的大炮向这个山头疯狂轰击，四十架敌机放肆地向山头倾泻雨点般的炸弹。凝固汽油弹从四面八方熊熊燃烧起来。
      “让敌军走近些，距离五米的时候再开枪！”阮文诺向班长说着，就背上枪，迅速地沿着战壕跑到前面去了。
    一营美军向山头爬来。只有五米了，阮文诺猛然站起来，举起枪，扣动扳机，全组的战友也同时开火。走在前头的两个班美军全部中弹倒地。侥幸没有死的鬼子丢了枪，在地上又滚又爬地向山脚溃逃。不久，敌人的飞机又俯冲下来，向这个山头乱扔炸弹。阮文诺鼓励战友们说：“我们要象阮文追烈士一样英勇战斗！大家要尽量节约子弹，坚持打到底。冲锋枪要等敌人距离五米时再开火，步枪要装上刺刀，手榴弹要扭开盖子，看得准准才扔出去！”
    敌机投了炸弹，跟着又扔下大量凝固汽油弹，整个山头都起火了。阮文诺组里的战士都被凝固汽油弹烧伤了。只有阮文诺自己因为紧靠着敌军，没被炸中。敌机轰炸过后，心惊胆战的美军又向山头爬来了。等敌人爬近了，勇士们出其不意，再一次给予迎头痛击。敌人又马上溃退。
    敌军退到山脚后，阮文诺赶快返回头来，把受伤的战友背到工事里，为他们包扎伤口，然后把伤员的枪全都集中到自己面前，边挖新的工事，边监视敌军。
    敌人惊魂稍定，又集中力量，发动最后一次进攻。在阮文诺的面前，几百名象恶兽一样的美军，向山头爬来。现在，只剩下阮文诺一个人来同敌人作战了。
    敌军分成两翼爬上来。阮文诺镇定地等他们进入射程后，才又一次出其不意地开火，他先扫射右边的，接着又扫射左边的。敌人仗恃自己人多，继续大喊大叫地向上爬。阮文诺第一次受了伤。这时，冲锋枪的子弹打完了，他又拿起步枪来打。接着，他又第二、第三次受伤，但他仍然咬紧牙关，对准一个个敌人开枪。步枪的子弹又打完了，他拿起手榴弹继续坚持战斗。最后，他手里只剩下一颗手雷了。
    阮文诺拣起所有已经没有子弹的武器，用尽气力把它们砸碎，然后把最后的一个手雷抱在怀里。他等着……
    被打得丧魂落魄的敌军等了好一会，见山头没有动静，又嗷嗷叫着向上爬来。但没有一个人敢走在前头，他们拥在一起，五十米了，仍没枪声，三十米，还是没枪声，十米了。只见一个遍身被鲜血染红了的解放军战士突然从一个新挖的工事里站起来，他就是阮文诺。敌人惊住了，想逃跑。但来不及了，只见阮文诺迅速跃出工事，象一支箭一样，直插进聚集在一起的乱哄哄的敌军队伍中，接着，“轰！”的一声巨响，整个山头都震动了。
    弥漫的硝烟消散之后，只见地面上横七竖八地躺着几十名敌军的尸体。
    阮文诺虽然英勇牺牲了，但是，他和战友们，把这个山头变成了一个神圣不可侵犯的堡垒！
