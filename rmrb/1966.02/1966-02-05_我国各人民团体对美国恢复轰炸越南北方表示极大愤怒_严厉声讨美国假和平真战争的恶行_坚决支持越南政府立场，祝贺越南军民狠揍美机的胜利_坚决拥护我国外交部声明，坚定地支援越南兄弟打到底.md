    Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Chinese people's organizations today issued statements respectively, severely condemning the US imperialists' blatant resumption of barbaric bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. These statements pointed out that the US imperialists' resumption of bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is another self-exposure of the Johnson administration's face of fake peace and real war. This criminal act of US imperialism will absolutely not change its defeat in Vietnam. In their statements, the people's organizations expressed their firm support for the statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on February 2nd, firmly supported the solemn position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement on February 1st, warmly congratulated the Vietnamese army and people on their brilliant victories in shooting down invading US aircraft in recent days, and solemnly pointed out that the United Nations Security Council's discussion of the Vietnam issue is completely illegal, and the United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue.

    The people's organizations reiterated in their statements that no matter how far US imperialism expands the war, and no matter how great the price to be paid, the Chinese people will resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against US aggression and for national salvation until the Vietnamese people achieve final victory.

    The Chinese people's organizations that issued statements are: the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, the China Peace Committee, the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the China-Vietnam Friendship Association, and the China Political Science and Law Society.

    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' statement said that the US imperialists' resumption of barbaric bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam marks the complete bankruptcy of the great conspiracy painstakingly managed by US imperialism for more than a month, using the blackmail of "suspending bombing" in a vain attempt to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against US aggression and for national salvation. It makes people further see that the Johnson government is the biggest liar of contemporary times and the most barbaric executioner of contemporary times.

    The statement pointed out that the new crime of US imperialism in resuming bombing has aroused strong opposition from workers and people all over the world, and a new wave of demonstrations and protests has also been launched by the American people. US imperialism has fallen into an unprecedentedly isolated situation. The ugly faces of those who verbally support the Vietnamese people but actually engage in "easing" and "joint action" with US imperialism are even more exposed. Workers and people all over the world need to take further action to tighten the noose around the neck of US imperialism from all directions to support the Vietnamese people in defeating the US aggressors.

    The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation jointly stated that Chinese youth and students angrily condemn the new towering crimes of US imperialism in resuming the bombing of North Vietnam, and warmly celebrate the glorious victory of the Vietnamese brothers in shooting down many enemy aircraft.

    The statement said that whether US imperialism bombs or promotes "peace talk" conspiracies, it cannot save its shameful fate of defeat. Chinese youth and students will resolutely contribute everything they have to support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against US aggression and for national salvation. The statement said that at present, US imperialism is stepping up its expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam and is increasingly directing the spearhead of aggression at China. The Chinese people and youth and students have made all preparations. If US imperialism insists on imposing war on us, we will resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate all aggressors who dare to invade.

    The All-China Women's Federation's statement pointed out that while US imperialism was shouting about "peace talks," it continued to send more invading troops to South Vietnam, implementing an even more cruel "burn all, destroy all, kill all" scorched earth policy in South Vietnam, and step by step expanding the war of aggression to Laos and Cambodia. Now, after completing its deployment to expand the war, the Johnson government has once again resumed bombing of North Vietnam and launched so-called "five major offensives" against South Vietnam, obviously intending to further expand the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    The statement said that the Vietnamese people are a heroic people, Vietnamese women are heroic women, and Vietnamese children are heroic children. They will never be intimidated by US imperialism's war provocations, nor will they be deceived by US imperialism's despicable and shameless peace talk tricks. President Ho Chi Minh recently solemnly declared once again: "As long as there are US aggressors on our soil, our people will resolutely fight against them." The Vietnamese people and women with a spirit of great fearlessness are launching an even more heroic battle. Chinese women and the Chinese people are cheering for the steel-like fighting will of the Vietnamese brothers and sisters and the brilliant results they have achieved. The statement expressed firm belief that the US aggressors, who have committed heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people, will never escape the severe judgment of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world, and what awaits them is the fate of complete annihilation. The Vietnamese people's just struggle against US aggression and for national salvation will surely be victorious.

    The China Peace Committee's statement said that Johnson's "suspension of bombing" trick this time was carefully planned, the drums of the "peace offensive" were beaten solemnly, and modern revisionists waved the flag and shouted for it, actively cooperating. But Johnson, with his actions of resuming bombing, completely exposed the great conspiracy of this "peace offensive," and the revisionists were also slapped in the face.

    The statement said that the US government is now using the United Nations to defend its resumption of bombing and is re-peddling the old tune of "unconditional discussions." All people with a sense of justice condemn these conspiracies of US imperialism in unison, while only those who are keen on "joint action" remain silent and do not say a word. Our government's statement on February 2nd solemnly pointed out that the United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue, and the Security Council's discussion of the Vietnam issue is completely illegal. The solution to the Vietnam issue can only be that the United States earnestly fulfills the Geneva Accords, accepts the four points of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five points of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front.

    The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity in its statement severely condemned US imperialism's shameless attempt to use the United Nations card to serve its war of aggression. The statement expressed full support for the statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on February 2nd, and expressed firm support for the Vietnamese government's solemn position that "all resolutions of the United Nations Security Council interfering in the Vietnam issue are completely invalid." The statement also expressed firm opposition to any actions that unite with US imperialism and sell out the interests of the Vietnamese people.

    The China-Vietnam Friendship Association's statement condemned US imperialism's brazen resumption of the crazy bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as a serious provocation against the Vietnamese people, the Indochinese people, and peace-loving people all over the world. The statement pointed out that US imperialism's new adventure in expanding the war in Vietnam has been condemned in unison by world opinion, including the American public. US imperialism has become even more desperate and unprecedentedly isolated on the Vietnam issue.

    The China-Vietnam Friendship Association's statement warmly praised the Vietnamese people's powerful counterattack against US imperialism's armed aggression. The statement said that the people of China and Vietnam are brothers who share weal and woe and comrades-in-arms who share adversity. The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the fraternal Vietnamese people against US aggression and for national salvation. No matter how far US imperialism expands the war, and no matter how great the price to be paid, the Chinese people will stand together with the fraternal Vietnamese people and fight together to completely defeat the US aggressors.

    The China Political Science and Law Society's statement pointed out that the Johnson government's resumption of bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the most barbaric violation of the sovereignty, territory, and security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the most thorough destruction of the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue, and the most shameless trampling on international law. Chinese legal workers, together with the Chinese people, angrily denounce this aggressive crime of US imperialism in expanding the war. The statement pointed out that the Johnson government, in order to cover up the aggressive actions of resuming bombing and expanding the war, submitted a so-called "proposal" on the Vietnam issue to the UN Security Council, attempting to use the United Nations as a tool to achieve its goal of aggression against Vietnam. The United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue, and the Security Council's discussion of the Vietnam issue is completely illegal, and any resolution it makes on the Vietnam issue is invalid. The Vietnam issue can only be resolved based on the four points of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five points of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front. US imperialism must get out of Vietnam.

    我国各人民团体对美国恢复轰炸越南北方表示极大愤怒
    严厉声讨美国假和平真战争的恶行
    坚决支持越南政府立场，祝贺越南军民狠揍美机的胜利
    坚决拥护我国外交部声明，坚定地支援越南兄弟打到底
    新华社四日讯　我国各人民团体今天分别发表声明严厉谴责美帝国主义悍然恢复对越南民主共和国的野蛮轰炸。这些声明指出，美帝国主义恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸，是约翰逊政府假和平、真战争的面目再一次的自我暴露。美帝国主义的这一罪恶行动，绝对改变不了它在越南的败局。各人民团体在声明中表示坚决拥护我国外交部二月二日发表的声明，坚决支持越南民主共和国外交部二月一日声明的严正立场，热烈祝贺越南军民连日来击落入侵美机的辉煌胜利，并且严正指出，联合国安全理事会对越南问题的讨论完全是非法的，联合国完全无权干预越南问题。
    各人民团体在声明中重申，不管美帝国主义把战争扩大到什么地步，也不管要付出多大代价，中国人民坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，直到越南人民取得最后胜利。
    发表声明的中国各人民团体是：中华全国总工会、中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中越友好协会和中国政治法律学会。
    中华全国总工会的声明说，美帝国主义恢复对越南民主共和国的野蛮轰炸，标志着美帝国主义一个多月来苦心经营的、用“暂停轰炸”的讹诈妄图扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争怒火的大骗局，已经彻底破产。它使人们进一步看清了约翰逊政府是当代最大的骗子手、是当代最野蛮的刽子手的真面目。
    声明指出，美帝国主义恢复轰炸的新罪行，激起了全世界工人和人民的强烈反对，美国人民也掀起了新的示威抗议浪潮。美帝国主义已经陷入了空前孤立的境地。那些口头上讲支持越南人民，实际上同美帝国主义搞“和缓”，搞“联合行动”的人的丑恶面目也更加暴露。全世界工人和人民需要进一步行动起来，从四面八方勒紧套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索，支援越南人民打败美国侵略者。
    中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会在联合发表的声明中指出，中国青年、学生愤怒谴责美帝国主义恢复轰炸越南北方新的滔天罪行，热烈庆贺越南兄弟击落多架敌机的辉煌胜利。
    声明说，美帝国主义轰炸也罢，推行“和谈”阴谋也罢，都挽救不了它可耻的失败命运。中国青年和学生将坚决为支援越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争而贡献出自己的一切。声明说，目前，美帝国主义正在加紧扩大侵越战争，并越来越把侵略矛头指向中国。中国人民和青年、学生已经作好一切准备。如果美帝国主义硬要把战争强加到我们头上，我们定将坚决、彻底、全部、干净地消灭敢于来犯的一切侵略者。
    中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会的声明中指出，美帝国主义在大叫大嚷“和谈”的同时，却继续向越南南方增派侵略军队，在越南南方实行更加残酷的“烧光、毁光、杀光”的焦土政策，并一步一步地把侵略战火扩大到老挝和柬埔寨。现在，约翰逊政府在完成了扩大战争的部署以后，再次恢复对越南北方的轰炸，对越南南方发动所谓“五大攻势”，显然是要进一步扩大侵越战争。
    声明说，越南人民是英雄的人民，越南妇女是英雄的妇女，越南儿童是英雄的儿童，他们决不会被美帝国主义的战争挑衅所吓倒，更不会为美帝国主义卑鄙无耻的和谈花招所欺骗。胡志明主席最近再一次庄严宣告：“只要我们的国土上还有美国侵略军，我国人民就坚决为反对他们而战斗。”具有大无畏精神的越南人民和妇女正在展开更加英勇的战斗，中国妇女和中国人民为越南兄弟姐妹钢铁般的战斗意志和他们所获得的辉煌战果而欢呼。声明中表示坚信，对越南人民犯下了滔天罪行的美国侵略者，决逃不脱越南人民和全世界人民的严厉裁判，等待着它的将是彻底灭亡的命运。越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争一定获得胜利。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的声明说，约翰逊这一次玩弄的“暂停轰炸”把戏煞费心机，“和平攻势”的锣鼓敲打得煞有介事，现代修正主义者则为之摇旗呐喊，四出奔走，积极配合。可是约翰逊以它恢复轰炸的行动，彻底揭穿了这场“和平攻势”的大骗局，修正主义者也被打了一记耳光。
    声明说，美国政府现在正利用联合国来为其恢复轰炸辩护，重新兜售“无条件讨论”的老调。所有有正义感的人们都同声谴责美帝国主义的这些阴谋，只有那些热中于搞“联合行动”的人才对此保持沉默，一声不吭。我国政府二月二日声明中严正指出，联合国根本无权干预越南问题，安全理事会讨论越南问题是完全非法的。越南问题的解决只能是美国切实履行日内瓦协议，接受越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。
    中国亚非团结委员会在声明中严厉谴责美帝国主义恬不知耻地企图用联合国这张牌来为它的侵略战争服务。声明表示完全拥护我国外交部于二月二日发表的声明，并且表示坚决支持越南政府关于“联合国安全理事会干涉越南问题的一切决议是完全无效的”这一严正立场。声明还表示坚决反对以任何手法联合美帝国主义、出卖越南人民利益的勾当。
    中越友好协会的声明中谴责美帝国主义悍然恢复对越南民主共和国的疯狂轰炸，是对越南人民、印度支那人民和全世界爱好和平人民的严重挑衅。声明指出，美帝国主义在越南扩大战争的新冒险，遭到了包括美国公众在内的世界各国舆论的同声斥责，美帝国主义在越南问题上已经更加走投无路，空前孤立。
    中越友协在声明中热烈赞扬越南人民对美帝国主义的武装侵略的强有力的回击。声明说，中越两国人民是休戚相关的兄弟，是患难与共的战友。中国人民坚决支持兄弟的越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争。不管美帝国主义把战争扩大到什么地步，也不论要付出多大代价，中国人民都将同兄弟的越南人民站在一起共同奋斗，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    中国政治法律学会的声明指出，约翰逊政府恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸，是对越南民主共和国主权、领土和安全的最野蛮的侵犯，是对一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议的最彻底的破坏，是对国际公法最无耻的践踏。中国法律工作者同中国人民一道，愤怒地声讨美帝国主义这一扩大战争的侵略罪行。声明在谈到约翰逊政府为了掩盖恢复轰炸和扩大战争的侵略行动，向联合国安理会提出所谓关于越南问题的“提案”，企图利用联合国这个工具来实现自己侵略越南的目的这一阴谋时指出，联合国根本无权干预越南问题，安全理事会讨论越南问题完全是非法的，它对越南问题作出的任何决议都是无效的。越南问题只能根据越南民主共和国的四点主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五项声明来解决。美帝国主义必须从越南滚出去。
