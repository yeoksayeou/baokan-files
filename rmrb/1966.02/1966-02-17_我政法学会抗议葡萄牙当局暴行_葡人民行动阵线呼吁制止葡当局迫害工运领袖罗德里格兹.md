    Xinhua News Agency, February 16th – The China Political Science and Law Society issued a statement today protesting the fascist crimes of the Portuguese authorities in persecuting Francisco Martins Rodrigues, a political leader of the Portuguese workers' movement and leader of the Portuguese People's Action Front.

    The statement said that the Portuguese People's Action Front had issued an appeal to save Rodrigues, expressing concern that Rodrigues was in mortal danger, and calling on all people who love peace, democracy, freedom, and uphold justice to stop the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese authorities.

    The statement said that Chinese legal workers express their solemn protest against the illegal atrocities of the Portuguese authorities in suppressing the democratic movement and persecuting patriots. Chinese legal workers and the Chinese people firmly support the Portuguese People's Action Front's call to save Rodrigues. This demand is in line with justice and humanity, and also in line with modern internationally recognized democratic norms and legal guarantees for respecting basic human rights.

    The statement concluded that the patriotic struggle of the Portuguese people will surely be victorious.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 16th – Paris News: The Portuguese People's Action Front issued an appeal, demanding that public opinion in various countries stop the Portuguese authorities from persecuting labor movement leader Francisco Martins Rodrigues.

    Rodrigues is a leader of the Portuguese People's Action Front. He was arrested in Lisbon at the end of January this year by the Portuguese "International State Defense Police." The police also arrested his wife, Álvaro Minho Rodrigues, his sister-in-law, Cecilia Lames Almeida, and his four children, aged four to fourteen.

    The Portuguese People's Action Front's appeal pointed out that the Portuguese "International State Defense Police" is accustomed to killing anti-fascist leaders, and therefore Rodrigues is in great danger of death.

    The appeal pointed out that the Portuguese "International State Defense Police" did not announce this arrest, which especially makes us worried about his life; it is possible that he was assassinated at the time of his arrest.

    The appeal calls on public opinion in various countries to intervene to stop the Portuguese authorities from torturing and killing this leader of the Portuguese workers' movement.

    我政法学会抗议葡萄牙当局暴行
    葡人民行动阵线呼吁制止葡当局迫害工运领袖罗德里格兹
    新华社十六日讯　中国政治法律学会今天发表声明，抗议葡萄牙当局迫害葡萄牙工人运动政治领袖、葡萄牙人民行动阵线领导人弗朗西斯库·马丁斯·罗德里格兹的法西斯罪行。
    声明说，葡萄牙人民行动阵线发出了拯救罗德里格兹的呼吁书，他们担心罗德里格兹具有死亡的危险，呼吁爱好和平、民主、自由和主持正义的人们制止葡萄牙当局的法西斯暴行。
    声明说，中国法律工作者对葡萄牙当局镇压民主运动和迫害爱国人士的非法暴行表示严正的抗议。中国法律工作者和中国人民坚决支持葡萄牙人民行动阵线呼吁拯救罗德里格兹的要求。这一要求是符合于正义和人道的，也是符合于现代国际公认的民主准则和尊重基本人权的法律保障的。
    声明最后说，葡萄牙人民的爱国斗争必将取得胜利。
    新华社十六日讯　巴黎消息：葡萄牙人民行动阵线发表呼吁书，要求各国舆论制止葡萄牙当局迫害工人运动领袖弗朗西斯库·马丁斯·罗德里格兹。
    罗德里格兹是葡萄牙人民行动阵线领导人。他在今年一月底在里斯本被葡萄牙“国际卫国警察局”逮捕。警察还逮捕了他的妻子阿尔沃·米纽·罗德里格兹、他的嫂嫂西西丽亚·拉梅斯·阿尔梅达以及他的从四岁到十四岁的四个孩子。
    葡萄牙人民行动阵线的呼吁书指出，葡萄牙“国际卫国警察局”惯于杀害反法西斯领导人，因此，罗德里格兹有死亡的巨大危险。
    呼吁书指出，葡萄牙“国际卫国警察局”没有公布这次逮捕，这一点尤其使我们担心他的生命；他有可能在被捕时就被暗杀。
    呼吁书要求各国舆论进行干预，制止葡萄牙当局折磨和杀害这位葡萄牙工人运动的领袖。
