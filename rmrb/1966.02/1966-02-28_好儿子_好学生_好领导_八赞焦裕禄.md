　　Good Son, Good Student, Good Leader
　　Eight Praises for Jiao Yulu
　　Zeng Shangyou
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was a good leader of the people of Lankao County. He creatively applied Chairman Mao's works, leading the people of Lankao to overcome natural disasters and change the face of production in a short period of time.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was a good son of the people of Lankao County. He truly listened to Chairman Mao's words and went to Lankao County, not to be an official or a master, but to wholeheartedly serve the people of Lankao as a servant and a long-term worker.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was also a good student of the people of Lankao County. He followed Chairman Mao's teachings, took to his feet, and traveled to more than 120 brigades throughout the county, visiting the poor and asking about their suffering, and finding a new path for self-reliant construction in Lankao from the masses.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu used his practice to once again tell us that only by first being a good son and a good student of the masses can one become a good leader of the masses.
    What is the task of a Communist? In the final analysis, isn't it to serve the people? In the midst of a heavy snowstorm, Comrade Jiao Yulu entered the home of an old poor peasant, asking about warmth and hunger, saying, "I am your son." "Chairman Mao asked me to come and see you, old man." How well he spoke; this is the genuine sincerity of a Communist Party member. Every Communist Party member should be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, seeing themselves as the son of the masses, as the class brother of the masses. When the masses have difficulties, they should think that this is their own responsibility; when the masses have problems that cannot be solved, they "should feel ashamed."
    As a leader, what the masses require of him is not only being able to care about their pain and suffering, but more importantly, being able to point out the path and direction for them to advance. This means being like Comrade Jiao Yulu, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the masses, using the spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress to arm the masses, fighting against the wind, fighting against the sand, fighting against the water, and creating a new world with their own hands. Only by doing this can one be a good leader, a good guide, and truly a good son of the people.
    Where do the methods of struggle come from? They do not fall from the sky, they do not come from the office, they do not emerge from the minds of a few people, but must still go to the masses and be a primary school student of the masses. All true knowledge comes from the practice of struggle of the masses. Comrade Jiao Yulu found models for transforming Lankao with Mao Zedong Thought in Hancun, Qinzhai, Zhaoduolou, and Shuangyangshu, and promoted their experiences to the 360,000 masses throughout the county. When the consciousness of the masses is raised, and the correct path is found, they will be invincible in battle, and all the miracles of the world can be created.
    May all comrades working in leadership positions make themselves good sons, good students, and good leaders of the masses, and completely integrate caring for the masses, relying on the masses, educating the masses, and leading the masses in their work.

　　好儿子·好学生·好领导
　　八赞焦裕禄
　　曾尚友
    焦裕禄同志是兰考县人民的好领导。他活学活用毛主席著作，领导兰考人民，在不长的时间里，战胜自然灾害，改变了生产的面貌。
    焦裕禄同志是兰考县人民的好儿子。他真正听毛主席的话，到兰考县去，不是做官当老爷，而是全心全意地做兰考人民的勤务员，做兰考人民的老长工。
    焦裕禄同志又是兰考县人民的好学生。他遵照毛主席的教导，迈开两脚，走遍全县一百二十多个大队，访贫问苦，从群众中找到自力更生建设兰考的新道路。
    焦裕禄同志用他的实践再一次告诉我们，只有首先做群众的好儿子，好学生，才能成为群众的好领导。
    共产党人的任务是什么？归根到底，难道不就是为人民群众服务吗？大风雪中，焦裕禄同志走进老贫农的家中，问寒问饥，说：“我是您的儿子。”“毛主席叫我来看望您老人家。”他说得多好，这是一个共产党员的真心实意。每一个共产党员都应该象焦裕禄同志那样，把自己看成群众的儿子，看成群众的阶级兄弟，群众有了困难，就想到这是自己的责任，群众有了问题得不到解决，就“应该感到羞耻”。
    作为一个领导者，群众要求他的，不但是能够关心自己的痛痒，更重要的能够为自己指出前进的道路和方向。这就是要象焦裕禄同志那样，用毛泽东思想把群众武装起来，用自力更生、奋发图强的精神把群众武装起来，与风斗，与沙斗，与水斗，用自己的双手创造一个新世界。这样做，才是一个好的领导，好的领路人，也才真正是人民的好儿子。
    斗争的办法从哪里来？不是从天上掉下来，不是从办公室中来，不是从少数人的头脑中冒出来，还是要到群众当中去，做群众的小学生。一切真知都是从群众的斗争实践中产生出来的。焦裕禄同志从韩村、秦寨、赵垛楼、双杨树，找到了用毛泽东思想改造兰考的样板，又把它们的经验推广到全县三十六万群众当中去。群众的觉悟提高了，又找到了正确道路，他们就会在战斗中战无不胜，攻无不克，一切人间的奇迹都可以创造出来。
    愿我们一切在领导岗位上工作的同志，都来做群众的好儿子，好学生，好领导，把关心群众，依靠群众，教育群众和领导群众在自己的工作中完全地结合起来。
