　　According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, Feburary 17th: The Japanese Communist Party calls on all democratic forces to unite and oppose the Sato government's invitation to the South Vietnamese puppet Prime Minister Nguyen Cao Ky to Japan to carry out conspiratorial activities and serve the U.S. in accelerating the piecing together of a Northeast Asian military alliance.
　　According to Japanese government sources, Nguyen Cao Ky is scheduled to go to Japan in mid-March.
　　Tadashi Toki, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement on the 16th saying, "The South Vietnamese government is a pawn of U.S. imperialism. It is openly colluding with U.S. aggressive forces to suppress the Vietnamese people who are engaged in the struggle for people's liberation. The broad masses of the Japanese people are angry about the Sato government's formal invitation to the prime minister of this 'government' stained with the blood of the people."
　　He emphasized that the United States is intensifying its "peace" offensive fraud on the one hand and making every effort to expand its war of aggression, trying its best to make Asians fight Asians.
　　Toki pointed out: These circumstances are sufficient to show that Nguyen Cao Ky's trip to Japan is nothing more than a link in the U.S. plot to complete the Northeast Asian military alliance.
　　Tokumatsu Sakamoto, Chairman of the Japan Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, told a reporter from the *Akahata* on the 17th that Nguyen Cao Ky's visit to Japan shows that the U.S. and the South Vietnamese puppet regime are attempting to make full use of Japan's political and economic power to serve U.S. aggression in Vietnam.
　　According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 18th: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement on the 17th, strongly protesting the Sato government's invitation to the South Vietnamese puppet Prime Minister Nguyen Cao Ky to visit Japan.
　　The statement indicated that the Japanese Socialist Party does not recognize the South Vietnamese puppet clique. The statement said that the so-called "South Vietnamese government" is nothing more than a puppet fostered by the U.S. government to pursue its policy of "containment" against China and aggression in Asia.
　　The Japan-Vietnam Friendship Association also issued a statement on the same day, saying that the Sato government's invitation to Nguyen Cao Ky to visit Japan shows that it is further strengthening military, political, and economic aid and actively assisting the South Vietnamese puppet clique.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 20th: The *Rodong Sinmun* of Korea published a commentary on the 20th, pointing out that Park Chung-hee's recent activities in "Malaysia," Thailand, and Taiwan, which is occupied by Chiang Kai-shek, thoroughly exposed his true colors as a running dog of U.S. imperialism.
　　The commentary strongly condemned Park Chung-hee's criminal acts of serving the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to piece together a "Northeast Asian military alliance" and recruiting cannon fodder for the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam.
　　The commentary said that Park Chung-hee acted as a mouthpiece for the White House and the Pentagon during this visit, which shows that the organizers of Park Chung-hee's trip were the U.S. imperialist aggressors.
　　Commenting on Park Chung-hee's activities in Taiwan, the commentary said that Park Chung-hee and Chiang Kai-shek are both garbage discarded by the people, and their mutual flattery and clamoring for "anti-communism" cannot save them from their doom.
　　The commentary said that Park Chung-hee's crime of acting as a murderer in carrying out U.S. imperialist aggression policies and being an enemy of the Korean and Asian people cannot escape severe punishment; the masterminds and manipulators of these crimes—U.S. imperialism—must also pay the price for the crimes they have committed.

　　坚决反对美帝拼凑亚洲侵略联盟的新阴谋
　　日本各界反对南越傀儡访日为美国扩大侵略效劳
　　朝鲜报纸说美帝及其走狗逃脱不了亚洲人民惩罚
    据新华社十七日讯　东京消息：日本共产党号召一切民主力量团结起来，反对佐藤政府邀请南越傀儡总理阮高其到日本进行阴谋活动，为美国加紧拼凑东北亚军事联盟效劳。
    据日本政府人士透露，阮高其预定在三月中旬去日本。
    日共中央书记处书记土岐强在十六日发表声明说，“南越政府是美帝国主义的爪牙，它正在同美国的侵略势力进行公开勾结，镇压进行人民解放斗争的越南人民。日本广大人民对佐藤政府正式邀请这种沾满人民鲜血的‘政府’总理一事感到愤怒。”
    他着重指出，美国正在一面加紧策划它的“和平”攻势骗局，一面全力以赴地扩大侵略战争，尽力设法使亚洲人打亚洲人。
    土岐强指出：这些情况足以说明阮高其的日本之行，不外是美国为完成东北亚军事联盟阴谋的一个环节。
    日本亚非团结委员会理事长坂本德松十七日向《赤旗报》记者发表谈话指出，阮高其访日表明美国和南越傀儡政权企图充分利用日本的政治和经济力量来为美国在越南的侵略服务。
    据新华社东京十八日电　日本社会党十七日发表声明，强烈抗议佐藤政府邀请南越傀儡总理阮高其访问日本。
    声明表示，日本社会党不承认南越傀儡集团。声明说，所谓“南越政府”不过是美国政府为推行“遏制”中国和侵略亚洲政策而扶植起来的一个傀儡而已。
    日本越南友好协会也在同一天发表声明说，佐藤政府邀请阮高其访问日本，这就表明它在军事上、政治上、经济上进一步加强援助和积极协助南越傀儡集团。
    新华社平壤二十日电　朝鲜《劳动新闻》二十日发表评论指出，朴正熙最近到“马来西亚”、泰国和蒋介石盘据的台湾进行活动，彻底暴露出他充当美帝国主义走狗的真面目。
    评论强烈谴责朴正熙为美帝国主义拼凑“东北亚军事同盟”的阴谋效劳、替美帝国主义侵略越南战争搜罗炮灰的罪恶行径。
    评论说，朴正熙在这次出访中充当了白宫和五角大楼的扩音器的角色，这说明朴正熙这次旅行的组织者是美帝国主义侵略者。
    评论在谈到朴正熙在台湾的活动时说，朴正熙和蒋介石都是遭到人民唾弃的垃圾，他们相互吹捧和叫嚷“反共”，都挽救不了他们的灭亡。
    评论说，朴正熙充当执行美帝国主义侵略政策的凶手、与朝鲜人民和亚洲人民为敌的罪行，是逃脱不了严厉惩罚的；这些罪行的主谋和操纵者——美帝国主义也必须为他们所犯下的罪行付出代价。
