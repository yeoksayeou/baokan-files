    From a battle in a village in South Vietnam, we can see the American paper tiger.
    Cu Chi District’s Xinan Hui Township Guerrillas Smash a Large-Scale "Mopping-Up" Operation by Two Thousand American Troops
    Besieged the Enemy for Three Days, Repelled Two Enemy Attacks, and Coordinated with Neighboring Townships to Eliminate Over Two Hundred Enemy Soldiers
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 3rd - According to the latest war report released by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, from January 23rd to 27th, the guerrillas of Cu Chi District, Gia Dinh Province, in their battle to counter the large-scale "mopping-up" operation by two thousand American invading troops and their accomplice troops in Xinan Hui Township, south of Cu Chi District, killed and wounded more than 260 American invading troops, causing the enemy's "mopping-up" to suffer a shameful defeat.
    The report stated that the American invading troops were met with fierce resistance from the local guerrillas as soon as they invaded. The guerrillas besieged the enemy for three days, killing and wounding 67 American invading troops, destroying two military vehicles, and damaging one American fighter-bomber.
    On the morning of the 27th, the enemy desperately tried to break into Changlin Village. The guerrillas intercepted the enemy at the entrance of the village, killing 25 enemy soldiers on the spot and shooting down one helicopter.
    That afternoon, three hundred American invading troops, under the cover of fourteen armored vehicles, attempted to break into Changlin Village again. The guerrillas heroically resisted the enemy, killing and wounding 86 enemy soldiers and capturing four weapons, including two light machine guns.
    While the guerrillas of Xinan Hui Township were resisting the invading enemy, the guerrillas of Zhonglixia Township and Fuyong’an Township also coordinated their actions, launching attacks on American troops stationed in strongholds such as Tonggeng, Gaishu, and Shenru on the nights of the 25th, 26th, and 27th, eliminating nearly one hundred enemy soldiers.
    The report stated that in the aforementioned battles, many guerrilla fighters performed outstanding feats. One guerrilla fighter eliminated ten American invading troops, and a female guerrilla fighter killed four American robbers.
    The report stated that this is another major victory achieved by the army and people of Cu Chi District after achieving brilliant results in killing and wounding more than 1,300 American troops and their accomplice troops at the beginning of this year. These victories have caused the American aggressors' conspiracy to "pacify" this area to suffer a shameful defeat.

    从南越一个乡的战斗看美国纸老虎
    古芝县新安会乡游击队粉碎两千美军大“扫荡”
    围困敌人三天，打退敌人两次进攻，同邻乡配合行动，歼敌二百多
    新华社河内三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社发表的最新战报说，嘉定省古芝县的游击队从一月二十三日到二十七日在古芝县南面新安会乡反击二千名美国侵略军和帮凶军大规模“扫荡”的战斗中，共打死打伤美国侵略军二百六十多名，使敌人的“扫荡”遭到可耻的失败。
    报道说，美国侵略军刚刚进犯时就遭到了当地游击队的猛烈阻击，游击队把敌人围困了三天之久，并打死打伤美国侵略军六十七名，击毁军车两辆，击伤美国驱逐机一架。
    二十七日上午，敌人拼命想冲进长林村，游击队在村头截击敌人，当场打死敌人二十五名，击落直升飞机一架。
    当天下午，三百名美国侵略军在十四辆装甲车的掩护下，再次企图冲进长林村，游击队英勇地阻击敌人，打死打伤敌人八十六名，缴获武器四件，其中有轻机枪两挺。
    在新安会乡游击队阻击来犯敌人的同时，中立下乡和福永安乡游击队也配合行动，在二十五日、二十六日和二十七日夜晚向驻在同更、盖熟、申如等据点的美军发动进攻，歼敌近一百名。
    报道说，在上述战斗中，许多游击队战士立下了出色的战功，一个游击队战士歼灭了十名美国侵略军，还有一个游击队女战士击毙了四名美国强盗。
    报道说，这是古芝县军民继今年年初取得打死打伤美军及其帮凶军一千三百多名的辉煌战果后，取得的又一次重大胜利。这些胜利使得美国侵略者妄图“绥靖”这一地区的阴谋遭到了可耻的失败。
