    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 9th – The Afro-Asian-Latin American People's Solidarity Organization on February 9th called on the people of the three continents and the people of the world to hold a Week of Solidarity with the Vietnamese People from March 12th to 19th this year.
    The appeal condemned US imperialism for resuming and intensifying the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, stepping up its aggression against South Vietnam, and attempting to use the United Nations to legitimize its aggression.
    The appeal said that these new actions by US imperialism force the people of the world to redouble their efforts to sever the murderous claws of imperialism.
    The appeal said that the Vietnamese people's struggle proves that no matter how powerful the enemy is, it can never defeat the people who are determined to launch a struggle and seize victory.
    The appeal called for support for the five-point statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front and the four-point proposition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The appeal demanded that US imperialism withdraw its aggressor troops from South Vietnam, stop bombing North Vietnam and invading South Vietnam, and recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the only legal representative of the people of South Vietnam.
    The appeal called on the people of all countries to further strengthen and expand support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people in every possible way.
