    The United States Purchases Large Quantities of War Supplies for Aggression Against Vietnam in Japan
    Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" Receive American Military Training in Okinawa
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd) Tokyo News: Japan's "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper revealed on the 3rd that, in order to intensify its war of aggression against Vietnam, the United States' "special procurement" in Japan has increased sharply.
      "Akahata" said that the United States is also purchasing poison gas and materials for manufacturing poison gas in Japan.
    According to publicly announced figures, the value of military supplies purchased by the U.S. military's procurement departments in Japan and shipped to South Vietnam increased from $1.2 million in January of last year to $7.7 million in November.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd) According to the "Okinawa, Obara Shimbun" report, approximately 500 officer cadets from Japan's "Air Self-Defense Force" (Air Force) and "Ground Self-Defense Force" (Army) have recently been dispatched by Japan's "Defense Agency" (disguised Ministry of Defense) to American military bases in Okinawa, which are used for aggression against Vietnam, to receive military training from the U.S. military authorities.
    The report pointed out that just as the United States is expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, the Japanese "Defense Agency's" dispatch of officer cadets to Okinawa for "field training" exposes the Japanese government's attempt to send troops abroad.

    美国在日本大量采购侵越军火
    日本“自卫队”在冲绳接受美国军事训练
    据新华社三日讯　东京消息：日本《赤旗报》三日透露，美国为了加紧进行侵越战争，在日本的“特需”采购急剧增加。
      《赤旗报》说，美国还在日本采购毒气和制造毒气用的物资。
    据公开宣布的数字，美军在日本的采购部门所购买的、运往南越的军用物资从去年一月的一百二十万美元，增加到十一月的七百七十万美元。
    据新华社东京二日电　据《冲绳、小原新闻》报道，日本“航空自卫队”（空军）和“陆上自卫队”（陆军）的见习军官约五百人，最近被日本“防卫厅”（变相的国防部）派往冲绳美国侵略越南的军事基地接受美军当局的军事训练。
    报道指出，正当美国扩大侵略越南战争的时候，日本“防卫厅”派见习军官到冲绳进行“实地训练”，暴露了日本政府向海外派兵的企图。
