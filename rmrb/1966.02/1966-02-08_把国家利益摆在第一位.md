    Putting National Interests First
    Zhao Tianxiang, Secretary of the Party Branch of Shanghai Alcohol Factory
    From our factory's experience in resolving the contradiction between improving product quality and saving coal over the past year, we have deeply realized that an enterprise must consider any issue from a global perspective and put national interests first. Otherwise, what is thought to be saving is actually a waste.
    The methanol content of the medicinal alcohol produced by our factory has always been maintained at a level close to 2.5 per mille, which meets the requirements of the pharmacopoeia.
    A year ago, several chemical factories came to us, hoping that we could further reduce the methanol content, otherwise, they would not be able to further improve the quality of their products.
    Regarding the users' requirements, the cadres in our factory had very different opinions. Most people agreed, and a few disagreed. The reason for disagreeing was: the methanol in the alcohol has not exceeded the national standard, and further reduction will definitely increase coal consumption, which is not cost-effective. Based on the opinion of the majority, we decided to add a distillation tower to refine the alcohol that could originally be shipped as a finished product.
    After the new distillation tower was built, the result of the first day of testing was that the methanol content was reduced to about 2 per mille, but the coal consumption per ton of alcohol increased by more than 30 kilograms. At this time, many comrades were very nervous. Why nervous? Because at that time, we heard a news that the coal consumption per ton of alcohol in an alcohol factory in Henan was already close to our level. To put it bluntly, we were afraid that we would not be able to keep the title of advanced coal-saving unit. After our leaders studied it, we felt that it was not a good idea to not be able to reduce the methanol content very much for a while, but instead increase the coal consumption, so we decided not to test it.
    At the beginning of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all walks of life to carefully visit users, compare themselves with the users' requirements, find the gap in the quality of their products, and strive to improve quality according to the users' requirements.
    We organized a group of cadres, workers, and technicians, led by the factory director, to visit several reagent factories and pharmaceutical factories. Everyone saw with their own eyes that in order to improve the quality of medicines, some factories used our alcohol for copying and processing, using a lot of coal, and spending a lot of effort to reduce the methanol content by a little bit. Some products cannot even be shipped because of the high methanol content. At this time, we truly realized that: in order to save a little coal, we did not actively reduce the methanol content, but users had to spend more coal to solve this problem. Many cadres deeply realized that: in the past, we only saw the savings of our own factory, but did not see the overall situation; this kind of saving that only cares about the local situation and ignores the overall situation is actually a waste for the entire country.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "In studying problems, we must avoid subjectivity, one-sidedness, and superficiality. ... The so-called one-sidedness is not knowing how to look at problems comprehensively. ..." He also said: "Marxists should not only see the part, but also the whole." Comparing it with Chairman Mao's words, and discussing it, the cadres' thinking improved. Everyone felt that in the past we only calculated economic accounts, not political accounts, only calculated small local accounts, not large overall accounts, and did not put national interests first. And this kind of concern only for one's own honor, not for the users' requirements, is essentially a kind of championship mentality.
    After our thinking was corrected, we examined the reasons for the failure of the experiment, and laid out the problems one by one and studied the solutions one by one. Cadres, workers, and technicians went to the scene, discussed and worked together, and as a result, no additional distillation tower was added, and only some improvements were made to the old equipment, and the methanol content was reduced from 2.5 per mille in the past to 1.5 per mille. When the situation was good, it was only a little over 1 per mille, and the coal consumption was also pulled down, without using any more coal.
    This incident also made us deeply realize that: we must calculate the big accounts of the country, but this does not mean that we can ignore the "small accounts" of the enterprise. Because our enterprise is a socialist enterprise, and the local interests are also part of the overall interests. Under the premise of obeying the overall interests, further reducing coal consumption is also considering the overall situation and the country. As long as we truly mobilize the masses of employees and concentrate everyone's wisdom to make improvements in technology, we can unify the requirements of improving quality and reducing coal consumption, and receive greater benefits.
    We have worked hard to do this. Nineteen sixty-five was a year in which the quality of the factory's products was significantly improved, and it was also a year in which coal consumption was greatly reduced.

### 把国家利益摆在第一位

    把国家利益摆在第一位
    上海酒精厂党支部书记　赵天祥
    从我厂一年来解决提高产品质量和节约煤炭的矛盾中，使我们深深体会到：一个企业考虑任何问题必须从全局出发，把国家利益摆在第一位，否则，自以为是节约，实际上是浪费。
    我们厂生产的药用酒精，甲醇的含量一直保持在接近千分之二点五的水平，符合药典的要求。
    一年前，有几家化工厂找上门来了，希望我们把甲醇的含量再降低一些，否则，他们就不能进一步提高产品质量。
    对用户的要求，我们厂里干部看法很不一致。多数人同意，少数人不同意。不同意的理由是：酒精里的甲醇，本来就没有超过国家规定的标准，再要降低，煤炭用量肯定要增加，不合算。我们根据多数人的意见，决定添一个蒸馏塔，把原来可以作为成品出厂的酒精，再精炼一道。
    新蒸馏塔建成后，第一天试验的结果，甲醇含量降低到千分之二左右，但每吨酒精的用煤量多了三十多公斤。这时候，许多同志很紧张。为什么紧张？因为当时听到一个消息，说河南有家酒精厂，每吨酒精的用煤量已经接近我们的水平了。说穿了，就是怕我们这个节煤先进单位的称号保不住了。我们几个领导干部研究了一下，觉得甲醇一时又不能降得很低，煤耗反而上升，不是个办法，决定不试验了。
    去年年初，中共上海市委号召各行各业都要好好访问用户，同用户的要求相比，找自己产品质量的差距，根据用户的要求，努力提高质量。
    我们组织了一批干部、工人和技术人员，在厂长带领下，访问了几个试剂厂、制药厂。大家亲眼看到有些工厂为了提高药品质量，拿我们的酒精进行复制加工，用了许多煤炭，费了好大的劲，甲醇的含量才降低一点点。有些产品因为甲醇的含量高，甚至不能出厂。这时候，我们才真正认识到：我们为了省一点煤炭，不积极降低甲醇的含量，可是用户为了解决这个问题，却要花费更多的煤炭。许多干部都深切地体会到：我们过去只看到自己一个厂的节约，看不到全局；这种不顾全局、只顾局部的节约，对整个国家来说，实际上是一种浪费。
    毛主席教导我们说：“研究问题，忌带主观性、片面性和表面性。……所谓片面性，就是不知道全面地看问题。……”又说：“马克思主义者看问题，不但要看到部分，而且要看到全体。”拿毛主席的话一对照，一讨论，干部们的思想提高了。大家都觉得过去我们只算了经济账，没有算政治账，只算了局部的小账，没有算全局的大账，没有把国家利益放在第一位。而这种只关心自己的荣誉，不关心用户的要求，实质上是一种锦标主义思想。
    思想端正后，我们又检查了试验失败的原因，把问题一个个摊开来，一个个研究解决的办法。干部、工人和技术人员到现场，一起商量，一起劳动，结果没有增加什么蒸馏塔，只是在老设备上作了些改进，甲醇的含量就从过去的千分之二点五，降低到一点五，情况好的时候，只有千分之一多些，并把煤耗也拉下来了，一点都没有多用煤。
    这件事，还使我们深切地体会到：国家的大账，我们要算，但不等于我们就可以不去关心企业的“小账”。因为我们的企业是社会主义企业，局部利益也是全局利益中的一部分。能在服从全局利益的前提下，进一步再降低煤炭，这同样是为大局着想，为国家着想。只要我们真正把职工群众发动起来，集中大家的智慧，在技术上作改进，是可以把提高质量和降低煤耗这两方面的要求统一起来，收到更大的效益的。
    我们努力这样做了。一九六五年，是厂里产品质量有显著改进的一年，也是煤炭消耗大大降低的一年。
