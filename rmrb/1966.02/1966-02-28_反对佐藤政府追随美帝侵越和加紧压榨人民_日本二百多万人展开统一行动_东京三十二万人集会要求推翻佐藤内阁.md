　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 27th Dispatch: Two million one hundred thousand Japanese workers, farmers, and citizens launched large-scale demonstrations in 218 locations across the country on the 27th, opposing the rise in prices and public utility fees, and opposing the American aggression against Vietnam.
　　This demonstration was organized by the Spring Labor Joint Struggle Committee, and it is part of the first unified action of the Spring Labor Struggle. The Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the All Japan Farmers Association Federation, and other democratic organizations actively supported and participated in the action.
　　In Tokyo, 320,000 people held a grand rally on this day. People held high banners and placards with slogans such as: "The government must stop colluding with US imperialism in the war of aggression against Vietnam! Increase our wages!" "Overthrow the Sato Cabinet that implements price increase policies!"
　　A call to action passed by the assembly stated: "We, the people, can no longer stand idly by. We must stand up and demand the protection of our lives. Workers, farmers, and citizens must join hands and roar at the Sato Cabinet, forcing it to resign."
　　Kasuga Shoichi, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, pointed out in his speech at the assembly that the Sato government is intensifying the plunder of the working people through inflationary policies and cooperation with US imperialism in the war of aggression against Vietnam. Kasuga called on the participants to combine political struggles with economic struggles, and emphasized the importance of combining the current rising struggle against the US war of aggression against Vietnam with the struggle of the working class and other broad masses of people to defend their lives and rights.
　　Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, spoke on behalf of the organizers of the assembly, saying: Our struggle is to defend our lives. He emphasized the need to strengthen the struggle in workplaces and residential areas.
　　Sasaki Kozo, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, pointed out in his speech at the assembly that the Sato Cabinet's inflationary policy reflects the government's financial crisis and predicament. He called on the Japanese people to unite and strengthen the struggle to protect their lives, defend democracy and workers' rights, and oppose the American war of aggression against Vietnam.
　　After the assembly, the participants divided into five routes and held demonstrations in the bustling areas of Tokyo.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 27th Dispatch: In order to shift economic difficulties onto the Japanese working people, the Sato government has continued to raise prices and public utility fees since the beginning of this year, and has decided to issue a large number of public bonds.
　　According to the "Diamond" magazine published on February 7th, in January, the retail price of rice rose by another 8.6%, and subway fares rose by 26.5%. In February, state-owned railway fares rose by 31.2%, and postal rates rose by 28.8%. In addition, the prices of salt, cigarettes, medical expenses, tuition fees, telephone charges, bus fares, etc., all items closely related to people's lives, have been rising.
　　In order to intensify the plunder of the Japanese people, the Sato government has also decided to issue a large number of public bonds. According to the "Economist" magazine published on February 8th, in addition to issuing 730 billion yen of central government bonds, the Japanese government will also issue more than 670 billion yen of local government bonds and 400 billion yen of government-guaranteed bonds (principal and interest guaranteed by the government). If foreign exchange securities, food securities, and other disguised public bonds are added, the amount of public bonds issued will actually reach 2 trillion yen, equivalent to half of this year's Japanese national budget. The Japanese government plans to use these public bond funds to invest in and loan to monopoly enterprises to rescue their economic difficulties.

　　反对佐藤政府追随美帝侵越和加紧压榨人民
　　日本二百多万人展开统一行动
　　东京三十二万人集会要求推翻佐藤内阁
    新华社二十七日讯　东京消息：二百一十万日本工人、农民和市民二十七日在全国二百一十八个地方发动了大规模的示威行动，反对物价和公用事业费用上涨，反对美国侵略越南。
    这次示威行动是由春季工人共同斗争委员会组织的，它是春季工人斗争第一次统一行动的一部分。日本共产党、社会党、全日本农民协会联合会和其他民主组织积极支持和参加了这次行动。
    在东京，三十二万群众在这一天举行盛大集会。人们高举着横幅和标语牌，上面写着：“政府必须停止协同美帝国主义进行侵越战争！增加我们的工资！”“推翻实行涨价政策的佐藤内阁！”
    大会通过的一项呼吁书说：“我们人民不能再等闲视之。我们必须挺身而出，要求保障我们的生活。工人、农民和市民要携手向佐藤内阁怒吼，迫使它辞职。”
    日共中央政治局委员春日正一在大会讲话时指出，佐藤政府正在通过通货膨胀政策、同美帝国主义在侵越战争中合作，加紧对劳动人民的掠夺。春日号召与会者把政治斗争和经济斗争结合起来进行，并强调把现在不断高涨的反对美国侵越战争的斗争同工人阶级和其他广大人民保卫他们的生活和权利的斗争结合起来的重要意义。
    日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章代表大会组织者在会上讲话说：我们的斗争是要保卫生活。他强调要在工作的地方和居住的地区加强斗争。
    日本社会党委员长佐佐木更三在大会讲话时指出，佐藤内阁的通货膨胀政策反映了政府的财政危机和困境。他呼吁日本人民团结起来，为保障生活、保卫民主和工人权利以及反对美国侵越战争而加强斗争。
    大会结束后，与会者分五路在东京热闹地区举行了示威游行。
    据新华社二十七日讯　东京消息：为了向日本劳动人民转嫁经济困难，佐藤政府今年以来继续提高物价和公用事业费用，并决定大量发行公债。
    据二月七日出版的《钻石》杂志报道，一月份，大米零售价格又上涨了百分之八点六、地下铁路票价上涨了百分之二十六点五。二月份，国营铁路运费上涨百分之三十一点二、邮费上涨百分之二十八点八。此外，食盐、香烟、医药费、学费、电话费、公共汽车费等，凡是同人民生活有密切关系的没有一个不在涨价。
    为了加紧掠夺日本人民，佐藤政府还决定发行大量的公债。据二月八日出版的《经济学人》杂志透露，日本官方除了发行七千三百亿日元的中央公债外，还要发行六千七百多亿日元的地方公债、四千亿日元的政府保证债（还本还息由政府担保），如果再加上外汇证券、粮食证券等变相公债，公债的发行额实际上将达到二万亿日元，相当于今年度日本国家预算总额的一半。日本政府准备利用这些公债款向垄断企业投资和贷款，挽救它们的经济困难。
