    Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, February 4th. The struggle of Belgian coal miners against the government's import of American coal and the closure of Belgian mines, and for the right to work, is further expanding. Students across the country are holding strikes and demonstrations to support the miners' struggle.

    On the 3rd, thousands of miners in Limburg province attended the funeral of the two demonstrators who were shot dead by Belgian gendarmes during the demonstration on the 31st. Mines and factories throughout the province stopped work to express their condolences.

    Delegations from the Belgian Communist Party and the Flemish Communist Party attended the funeral with their flags. Among these delegations were Jacques Grippa, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, and Maurice Delogne, a member of the Political Bureau. Jules Vandeleene, a member of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, spoke at the funeral, paying tribute to those who sacrificed themselves in the suppression and condemning the Belgian government, which is subservient to American imperialism, for killing these workers. The angry voices of the masses reverberated at the funeral.

    On the afternoon of the 3rd, in Hasselt, the capital of Limburg province, more than 1,000 students held a demonstration to protest the gendarmes' shooting of demonstrators and to support the miners' strike. The gendarmes used tear gas to suppress the demonstrating students.

    On the one hand, the Belgian government is attempting to alleviate the workers' anger with vague promises of "helping workers find new employment," while on the other hand, it is wantonly arresting outstanding worker leaders in this strike, attempting to crush the miners' actions. According to recent news, Willy D'Haeseleer, the leader of the Flemish Communist Party in Limburg province and a miner, was arrested by the gendarmes, along with some Communist Party members and more than forty miners. However, these methods of the Belgian government cannot weaken the workers' fighting will. The Belgian Communist Party's weekly publication, *The Voice of the People,* published an editorial written by Jacques Grippa, Secretary of the Belgian Communist Party, on February 4th. It said that the shooting of workers in Limburg tore off the mask of the Belgian ruling party, which serves big capital and American imperialism, and also tore off the mask of the bourgeois parliamentary system. This incident also exposed the deceptive nature of Khrushchev's theory of "peaceful transition to socialism," "peaceful coexistence" and cooperation between oppressors and the oppressed, and between exploiters and the exploited.

    The editorial said that the struggle against intensified exploitation and suppression of the working people, against the closure of mines and the dismissal of workers, has reached a climax. The editorial called on the working people to strengthen their struggle and avenge the killed and injured working people.

    林堡的枪声粉碎现修“和平过渡”谬论
    格里巴同志谴责屈从美帝的比利时政府枪杀示威工人
    新华社布鲁塞尔四日电  比利时煤矿工人反对政府进口美国煤和关闭比利时矿井、争取工作权利的斗争在进一步扩大。各地青年学生举行罢课示威来声援矿工的斗争。
    三日，林堡省数以千计的矿工参加了在三十一日的示威中被比利时宪兵开枪打死的两名示威者的葬礼。全省的矿井和工厂都停止了工作，表示哀悼。
    比利时共产党和佛兰德共产党的代表团带着它们的旗帜参加了葬礼。这两个代表团中有，比利时共产党中央委员会书记雅克·格里巴，政治局委员莫里斯·德洛涅。比利时共产党中央委员会委员儒勒·汪代·伦当在葬礼上讲了话，他向在镇压中牺牲的人致敬，并谴责了屈从于美帝国主义的比利时政府杀害这些工人。群众的愤怒的声音在葬礼上震响。
    三日下午，在林堡省省会哈塞尔特，一千多名学生举行示威，抗议宪兵枪杀示威者，声援矿工的罢工斗争。宪兵使用催泪瓦斯镇压示威学生。
    比利时政府一方面企图用“帮助工人重新就业”的含糊诺言来缓和工人们的愤怒情绪，同时却大肆逮捕在这场罢工斗争中的优秀的工人领袖，企图粉碎矿工的行动。不久前的消息说，佛兰德共产党林堡省的领导人、矿工维利·德热内夫被宪兵逮捕了，同时被逮捕的还有一些共产党员和四十多名矿工。但是，比利时政府的这些手段都削弱不了工人的斗争意志。比利时共产党机关刊物《人民之声》周刊二月四日发表了比利时共产党书记雅克·格里巴写的社论。它说，林堡的枪杀工人的事件扯掉了为大资本、为美帝国主义效劳的比利时执政党的面具，也扯掉了资产阶级议会制度的面具。这件事情也拆穿了赫鲁晓夫的“向社会主义和平过渡”、压迫者与被压迫者之间、剥削者与被剥削者之间“和平共处”和合作的理论的欺骗性。
    社论说，反对加紧剥削和镇压劳动人民、反对关闭矿井和解雇工人的斗争已经达到了高潮。社论号召劳动人民加强斗争，为被杀害和被打伤的劳动人民报仇。
