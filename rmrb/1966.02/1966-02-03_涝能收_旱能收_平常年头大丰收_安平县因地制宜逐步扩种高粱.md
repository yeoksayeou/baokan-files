    Sorghum Can Be Harvested in Waterlogging, Drought, and Abundant Harvests in Normal Years
    Anping County Gradually Expands Sorghum Planting Based on Local Conditions
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 2nd: Sorghum, a crop that has always been considered low-yielding, achieved a large-scale bumper harvest in Anping County, Hebei Province, last year. Local people say that sorghum protects crops and can be harvested in waterlogging, drought, and abundant harvests in normal years.
    Last year, the county planted more than 90,000 mu of sorghum, with an average yield of 280 jin per mu. The sorghum planting area was less than one-quarter of the county's total autumn-harvested crop planting area, but the sorghum output accounted for more than one-third of the total autumn grain output; sorghum stalks can provide half a year's firewood for the people of the county.
    In the past thirteen years, Anping County has been flooded nine times. Due to the floods, the county and commune leaders always wanted to plant more winter wheat to shorten the disaster period. As a result, the spring planting land was reduced, squeezing out sorghum, and more late autumn crops were planted. When the rainy season came, the seedlings were very small and were flooded. At the same time, many people one-sidedly believed that sorghum was a low-yielding crop and were unwilling to plant more. The sorghum planting area shrank from more than 100,000 mu in the past to 30,000 to 40,000 mu, resulting in slow growth in the county's total grain output. However, in 1963, Anping County experienced a major flood, and sorghum still yielded more than 100 jin per mu; in 1964, it encountered severe waterlogging, and 30,000 mu of sorghum yielded an average of 200 jin per mu. These facts made cadres and the masses realize that sorghum has the characteristics of resisting waterlogging and drought. According to the natural laws of Anping County, planting more sorghum based on local conditions can not only increase the total grain output, but also ensure a certain harvest in the event of drought or waterlogging. Sorghum planting should be gradually expanded.
    In order to promote sorghum production, the county planted more than 40,000 mu of sorghum demonstration fields last year, promoted reasonable close planting, and seriously controlled pests. It changed the old habits of sparse planting, not selecting seeds, not weeding, and not removing insects, and promoted the sorghum transplanting method, which enabled sorghum to achieve a bumper harvest.

### 涝能收　旱能收　平常年头大丰收  安平县因地制宜逐步扩种高粱

    涝能收　旱能收　平常年头大丰收
    安平县因地制宜逐步扩种高粱
    据新华社天津二日电　一向被认为低产作物的高粱，去年在河北省安平县大面积丰收了。当地群众说，高粱是保驾庄稼，涝能收，旱能收，平常年头大丰收。
    去年这个县种了九万多亩高粱，平均每亩产二百八十斤。高粱播种面积还不到全县秋熟作物播种面积四分之一，而高粱产量却占了秋粮总产量三分之一还多；高粱秸秆可抵全县人民的半年烧柴。
    安平县过去十三年中，便有九次被淹。由于遭受涝灾，县和公社领导上总想多种些冬小麦以缩短灾期。结果，春播地少了，挤掉了高粱，晚秋作物种得多，雨季一到，苗子很小，即被淹坏。同时，许多人片面地认为高粱是低产作物，不愿多种。高粱播种面积由过去的十几万亩缩小到三四万亩，结果全县粮食总产量增长缓慢。而在一九六三年安平县发生了特大洪水，高粱每亩还收一百多斤；一九六四年又遇到严重沥涝，三万亩高粱平均亩产二百来斤。这些事实使干部和群众认识到，高粱有抗涝抗旱的特性，根据安平县的自然规律，因地制宜多种一些高粱，不仅可以提高粮食总产量，而且遇到旱涝，也能有一定的收成。应当逐步扩种高粱。
    为了促进高粱增产，这个县去年种了四万多亩高粱样板田，推行合理密植，认真治虫，改变了稀植、不选种、不锄草、不除虫等旧习惯，并推行了高粱移栽法，使高粱获得了丰收。
