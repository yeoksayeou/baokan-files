    An Important Issue of Understanding

    In giving prominence to politics, how should we understand the role of "things"? What is the relationship between matter and thought? These are important questions that need to be discussed.
    In this regard, the experiences of the comrades in Fuxian County are noteworthy. They worked in a poor area and, with two different guiding ideologies, produced two different results. When they unilaterally emphasized material support, the cadres and masses there deepened their dependency mentality and weakened their fighting spirit, and the natural appearance of the area did not change much for a long time. But when they emphasized giving the masses revolutionary thought, the situation changed greatly. Things that originally could not be done were accomplished one by one in a short period.
    Here, we not only see the significant effects of giving prominence to politics, but also see the different roles of "things." When politics is not in command, useful "things" produce bad effects. Only when revolutionary thought commands "things" can "things" play their due role. "Things" must serve proletarian politics and be commanded by politics in order to truly be effective. This is our correct attitude towards "things."
    Comrades in Binhai County also encountered similar problems in their work. They deeply realized that: from matter to matter, matter is "finite"; from spirit to matter, matter is "infinite." Why? Because people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can constantly create the materials they need. This well illustrates that, as leaders of a county, if they truly hope that the county's agricultural production will develop faster, they must first not simply grasp "things," but grasp people, grasp people's thoughts. To get "things," you must first start with "people"; do a good job of "people's" work, and you can transform it into matter.
    Why is it necessary to give prominence to politics? Leading comrades in various counties have their own experiences. Summarizing and elevating these experiences with Mao Zedong Thought will enable us to more deeply understand the principle that politics must command production.
    How to give prominence to politics? There are many issues of understanding that need to be clarified. The view and placement of "things" is an important issue of understanding related to giving prominence to politics, and it is necessary to explore it from all aspects.

    一个重要的认识问题
    在突出政治当中，对“物”的作用如何认识？物质与思想是什么关系？这是有待讨论的重要问题之一。
    在这方面，复县同志的体会，是值得注意的。他们在一个贫困地区工作，先后两种指导思想，引出两种不同的结果。当他们片面强调物质支援的时候，那里的干部和群众的依赖思想加深了，斗志减弱了，自然面貌长期没有多大的改变。而当他们强调给群众以革命思想，情况就大有改变。原来要办而办不好的事，短时间内一件件都办起来了。
    在这里，我们不仅看到突出政治的显著效果，同时也看到“物”的不同作用。在政治不挂帅的情况下，有用之“物”产生了不好的效果。只有用革命思想来统率“物”，“物”才能起到它应有的作用。“物”必须为无产阶级政治服务，为政治所统率，才能真正发生作用。这是我们对“物”的正确态度。
    滨海县的同志在工作中也发生过类似的问题。他们深刻地体会到：从物质到物质，物质是“有限”的；从精神到物质，物质是“无穷”的。为什么？就因为用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，可以不断创造出自己所需要的物质。这就很好地说明了，作为一个县的领导者，要是真正希望全县的农业生产更快地发展起来，首先不能单纯地抓“物”，而要抓人，抓人的思想。要“物”，必须先从“人”抓起；抓好“人”的工作，就能变出物质。
    为什么要突出政治？各县的领导同志都有自己的体会。把这些体会用毛泽东思想加以总结提高，我们就能更深刻地理解政治必须统率生产的道理。
    怎样突出政治？有很多认识问题要澄清。对待“物”的看法和摆法，是有关突出政治的一个重要的认识问题，有必要从各方面加以探讨。
