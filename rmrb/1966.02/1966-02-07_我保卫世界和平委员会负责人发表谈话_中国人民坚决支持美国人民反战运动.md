    Head of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defense of World Peace Issues Statement
    Chinese People Resolutely Support the American People's Anti-War Movement
    American imperialism is the enemy of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, the American people, and the people of the whole world. If the people of all countries strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, they will certainly be able to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors, shatter their war plans, and safeguard world peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 6th. The head of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defense of World Peace solemnly stated today: The Chinese people wholeheartedly support the American people's struggle against the Johnson administration's policy of aggression and war in Vietnam, and for the defense of world peace.
    The head of the Committee reiterated the resolute support for the American people when speaking about the new upsurge in the American people's anti-war movement. In his speech, he exposed the truth of American imperialism using "peace talks" as a smokescreen to cover up its conspiracy to expand its war of aggression, and pointed out that, apart from a very small number of renegades who recognize the enemy as friends and betray the interests of the people, all people with good will are increasingly recognizing the aggressive nature of American imperialism and its counter-revolutionary dual tactics.
    The head of the Committee, when speaking about the new upsurge in the anti-war movement in the United States, pointed out that American imperialism is the enemy of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, the American people, and the people of the whole world. The interests of the American people are consistent with the interests of the people of all countries. American imperialism is intensifying its killing and arson in Vietnam, which is plunging the American people deeper into the abyss of war. He expressed his heartfelt sympathy for the disasters and suffering endured by the American people. He said: Americans of different classes, different occupations, different races, and different political and religious beliefs have joined forces and adopted various forms to launch a powerful struggle against the war of aggression and against oppression and exploitation, and have become the most widespread anti-war movement in American history. The American people's just struggle is shaking the heart of American imperialism, inspiring the fighting Vietnamese people and the people of all countries, and has won the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world. The American ruling clique is alarmed and uneasy and is determined to put it out at all costs. However, we firmly believe that no suppression or sabotage can stop the American people from advancing courageously.
    The head of the Committee pointed out that the people of the whole world are engaged in fierce battles with American imperialism and its running dogs. The American people's anti-war movement is merging with the domestic struggle for democracy and freedom, especially the black people's liberation struggle, and internationally it is merging with the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggressors and the anti-American struggle of the people of all countries. These struggles encourage and support each other, converging into a huge torrent, impacting American imperialism. An international united front against American imperialism's policies of aggression and war is expanding and consolidating.
    He said: American imperialism is carrying out aggression and doing evil everywhere, and has been besieged by the people of all countries, including the American people. It has reached a dead end on the Vietnam issue, and neither "peace offensives" nor expanding the war can change its doomed fate. It is in internal and external difficulties, surrounded by enemies on all sides, and the more frantically it struggles, the closer it gets to its demise. Obviously, those who collude with American imperialism in joint actions will not escape the punishment of history.
    The head of the Committee emphasized that the Chinese people, together with the people of the world, angrily denounce the American imperialism's crime of aggression in expanding the war, and resolutely stand with the fraternal Vietnamese people to fight for the complete defeat of the American aggressors. We firmly believe that if the people of all countries strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, they will certainly be able to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors, shatter their war plans, and safeguard world peace. Vietnam will win, and American imperialism will be defeated! The American people and the people of the world will win, and American imperialism will be defeated!

    我保卫世界和平委员会负责人发表谈话
    中国人民坚决支持美国人民反战运动
    美帝国主义是越南人民、中国人民、美国人民、全世界人民的敌人。世界各国人民加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够彻底打败美国侵略者，粉碎它的战争计划，维护世界和平。
    新华社六日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会负责人今天庄严重申：中国人民衷心支持美国人民反对约翰逊政府的侵越政策和战争政策、为保卫世界和平而进行的斗争。
    和委会负责人是就美国人民反战运动的新高涨发表谈话时重申对美国人民的坚决支持的。他在谈话中揭露了美帝国主义用“和谈”烟幕来掩盖它扩大侵略战争阴谋的真相，并且指出，世界上除了极少数认敌为友、背叛人民利益的败类以外，一切具有善良意志的人民都越来越认清美帝国主义的侵略本性和反革命两手策略。
    和委会负责人在谈到美国国内反战运动的新高涨时指出，美帝国主义是越南人民、中国人民、美国人民、全世界人民的敌人。美国人民的利益同各国人民的利益是一致的。美帝国主义在越南变本加厉地杀人放火，这就使美国人民日益被投入战争的深渊。他表示衷心同情美国人民所遭受的灾害和痛苦。他说：不同阶层、不同职业、不同种族、不同政治和宗教信仰的美国人，已经联袂而起，采用多种多样的形式，为反对侵略战争、反对压迫剥削而展开强大的斗争，并且成为美国历史上最广泛的反战运动。美国人民的正义斗争震撼着美帝国主义的心脏，鼓舞了战斗中的越南人民和各国人民，得到了全世界爱好和平人民的同情和声援。美国统治集团感到惊慌不安，一定要扑灭了它才甘心。但是，我们坚信，任何镇压或破坏都不能阻挡美国人民奋勇前进。
    和委会负责人指出，全世界人民正同美帝国主义及其走狗进行着激烈的搏斗。美国人民的反战运动，在国内同争取民主自由的斗争、特别是黑人的解放斗争汇合在一起，在国际上同越南人民抗击美国侵略者的斗争和各国人民的反美斗争汇合在一起。这些斗争互相鼓舞、互相支持，汇合成一股巨大的激流，冲击着美帝国主义。一个反对美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的国际统一战线正在扩大和巩固。
    他说：美帝国主义到处侵略、到处作恶，遭到了各国人民包括美国人民的围攻。它在越南问题上已经走投无路，无论是“和平攻势”还是扩大战争，都改变不了它失败的命运。它内外交困、四面楚歌，越是疯狂挣扎，越是接近灭亡。显然，那些同美帝国主义勾勾搭搭搞联合行动的人，也决逃不脱历史的惩罚。
    和委会负责人强调说，中国人民同全世界人民一道，愤怒地声讨美帝国主义扩大战争的侵略罪行，坚决同兄弟的越南人民站在一起，为彻底打败美国侵略者而奋斗。我们深信，世界各国人民加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够彻底打败美国侵略者，粉碎它的战争计划，维护世界和平。越南必胜，美帝必败！美国人民和世界人民必胜，美帝国主义必败！
