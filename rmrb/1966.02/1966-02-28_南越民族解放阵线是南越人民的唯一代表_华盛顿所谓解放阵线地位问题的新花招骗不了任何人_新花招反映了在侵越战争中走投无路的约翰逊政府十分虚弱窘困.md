　　Xinhua News Agency, February 27th, commentary by our reporter:
　　In recent days, while intensifying and expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, Washington has also been playing some new tricks in the "peace talks" hoax. This time, they are making a big deal out of the issue of the status of the so-called National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.
　　On February 7th, Averell Harriman, the roving ambassador accompanying US President Johnson to the Honolulu conference, hinted that the United States might agree to the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam participating in "peace talks" as an "independent group." On February 19th, former President Kennedy's brother, Senator Robert Kennedy, advocated the establishment of a "coalition government" in South Vietnam, with the participation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, considering this as the "central issue for a negotiated settlement." As soon as Kennedy's proposal was put forward, many people came out to support it. President's Special Advisor Taylor, who has close ties with the Kennedy family, immediately expressed his support, saying that Kennedy's proposal was "very close to the government's position." The Johnson administration, apparently worried about the adverse effects of such premature leaks, came forward to express its opposition. On February 22nd, after attending a White House meeting, Taylor changed his tune, saying that he advocated "allowing the Viet Cong (referring to the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam) to participate in the new South Vietnamese government through free elections." On the same day, a White House spokesman emphasized that the US government's position was to "hold free elections" in South Vietnam, and said that if it were not for "establishing a coalition government with Communist participation before the elections," then there would be no difference between the government and Kennedy. Kennedy himself immediately modified his proposal, stating that he had "no difference" with the government's opinion.
　　In this way, Washington, in its cunning manner, has played this set of cards, letting the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam participate in "peace talks," participate in "elections," and participate in a "coalition government." In reality, the Washington gentlemen have already made it clear in their own words that this is entirely a deceptive trick of buying short and selling long. When releasing this "trial balloon," they have made it clear what they want and what they don't want. First, they still want to engage in "unconditional negotiations," but the US aggressor troops will never withdraw; second, whether it is participating in "negotiations," "elections," or a "coalition government," the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam can only be a "minority faction," and it must not be recognized as the sole representative of the South Vietnamese people, let alone allow the South Vietnamese people to control their own destiny. In their words, they will never allow the "Viet Cong to take over South Vietnam." In order to prevent the "risks" that might occur even in "elections" conducted under US bayonets, Kennedy said that the United States must exercise its "shrewd and capable political skills."
　　Washington's current offer of these lures is obviously based on its own considerations. Opportunists and political brokers like British Prime Minister Wilson, who are eager to serve the United States, are busily running around, trying to help Washington out of its predicament and create another "Munich" to sell out the South Vietnamese people. At this moment, Washington has put forward the deceptive plan regarding the status of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in order to stuff a little "capital" into these people's pockets and add a little appeal to the United States' deflated "peace talks" conspiracy.
　　However, no matter how much the Washington gentlemen boast and bluster, no matter how much they posture and clamor, their trickery cannot deceive or entice anyone. It is not difficult for anyone to see that the stuff the Americans are throwing out is incompatible with the four points of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point statement of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. How can the Vietnamese people, who are fighting heroically to drive out the US aggressors, tolerate the US aggressors continuing to赖 (lai: hang around) in South Vietnam, and at the same time agree that the sole true representative of the fourteen million South Vietnamese people – the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam – is just playing a supporting role and serving as a vase in the US-made puppet regime? Isn't it a pipe dream for the Americans to use this trick to deceive the Vietnamese people into accepting the joint rule of the US and its puppets in South Vietnam, so that the United States can achieve its goal of occupying South Vietnam and dividing Vietnam, which it cannot achieve on the battlefield?
　　The Vietnamese people's great war of resistance against US aggression and for national salvation has already achieved brilliant victories. The US aggressors have suffered repeated defeats and are in a dilemma. Washington's new tricks are being put forward precisely at a time when it is at a dead end and internal disputes are unprecedentedly fierce. It reflects the weakness and embarrassment of the Johnson administration. The Vietnamese people have infinite confidence in the inevitable victory of their just struggle. They have repeatedly declared that no matter how many sacrifices and hardships they have to endure, they are determined to fight to the end and completely crush the barbarous aggression of US imperialism.
　　Currently, the situation on the South Vietnamese battlefield is excellent. US imperialism is encountering insurmountable difficulties politically and militarily. Its defeat is irreversible. The heroic South Vietnamese people and their armed forces, with the assistance of their Northern compatriots and the support of the revolutionary people of the world, are persisting in their struggle, fighting heroically, and inflicting heavy blows on the US aggressors. There is no doubt that final victory will belong to the glorious Vietnamese people.

　　南越民族解放阵线是南越人民的唯一代表
　　华盛顿所谓解放阵线地位问题的新花招骗不了任何人
　　新花招反映了在侵越战争中走投无路的约翰逊政府十分虚弱窘困
    新华社二十七日讯　本社记者述评：
    这些天来，华盛顿在强化和扩大侵越战争的同时，又在“和谈”骗局方面搞了几手新花招。他们这次在所谓越南南方民族解放阵线地位问题上，大做其文章。
    二月七日，随同美国总统约翰逊参加檀香山会议的巡回大使哈里曼放风说，美国可以同意越南南方民族解放阵线作为“独立的集团”参加“和谈”。二月十九日，前总统肯尼迪的弟弟、参议员罗伯特·肯尼迪，鼓吹在南越成立一个由越南南方民族解放阵线参加的“联合政府”，认为这是“谈判解决的中心问题”。肯尼迪这个主张一出笼，许多人就出来捧场。同肯尼迪家族有密切关系的总统特别顾问泰勒，立即表示赞成，说肯尼迪的主张“同政府的立场非常接近”。约翰逊政府显然担心这种过早泄露的不利影响，出面表示反对。二月二十二日，泰勒在参加一次白宫会议之后改口说，他主张“通过自由选举让越共（指越南南方民族解放阵线）参加南越新政府”。同一天，白宫发言人强调，美国政府的主张是在南越“举行自由选举”，并且说，如果不是要“在选举前成立有共产党参加的联合政府”，那么政府同肯尼迪之间就没有分歧。肯尼迪本人紧接着修改了他的主张，表示他同政府的意见“没有分歧”。
    这样，华盛顿就用这种狡猾的方式，打出了让越南南方民族解放阵线参加“和谈”、参加“选举”、参加“联合政府”的这一套牌。而实际上，华盛顿老爷们已经用他们自己的话表明，这完全是一个买空卖空的骗人把戏。他们在放出这个“试探气球”的时候，把他们究竟要什么，不要什么，说得明明白白。第一，他们仍然要搞“无条件谈判”，但是，美国侵略军决不撤走；第二，不管是参加“谈判”、“选举”还是“联合政府”，越南南方民族解放阵线都只能当个“少数派”，决不能承认它是越南南方人民的唯一代表，更不能让南越人民掌握自己的命运，用他们的说法，就是决不容许“越共接管南越”。为了防止即使在美国刺刀下进行的“选举”可能发生的“风险”，肯尼迪说，美国一定要施展它的“精明能干的政治手腕”。
    华盛顿在目前抛出这些诱饵，显然是有它的考虑的。热心为美国效劳的英国首相威尔逊之流的投机家和政治掮客，正在忙忙碌碌，东奔西走，企图帮助华盛顿解脱困境，制造出卖南越人民的另一次“慕尼黑”。在这个时刻，华盛顿抛出了关于越南南方民族解放阵线地位问题的骗人方案，是为了给这些人的口袋里塞进一点点“本钱”，给美国泄了气的“和谈”阴谋增加一点诱惑力。
    但是，不论华盛顿的老爷们怎样大吹大擂，不论他们怎样装模作样，吵吵嚷嚷，他们的这套花招，是欺骗不了谁，诱惑不了谁的。任何人都不难看出，美国佬抛出的这套玩艺，同越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，是水火不能相容的。正在为赶走美国侵略者英勇战斗的越南人民，怎么可能容忍美国侵略者继续赖在南越不走，同时又同意一千四百万南越人民的唯一真正代表——越南南方民族解放阵线，只是在美制傀儡政权中跑龙套、当花瓶呢？美国人想用这种诡计来诱骗越南人民接受美伪在南越的联合统治，使美国可以实现它在战场上无法达到的霸占南越和分裂越南的目的，岂不是白昼见鬼？
    越南人民伟大的抗美救国斗争，已经取得了辉煌的胜利。美国侵略者连遭惨败、正处在进退维谷的境地。华盛顿的新花招，正是在它走投无路、内部争吵空前激烈的情况下提出的。它反映了约翰逊政府的虚弱和窘困。越南人民对于他们的正义斗争的必然胜利，具有无限的信心。他们已经反复宣告，不管还要付出多少牺牲，经历多少艰苦，他们决心战斗到底，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的野蛮侵略。
    目前在南越战场上，是一片大好形势。美帝国主义在政治上、军事上都遇到不可克服的困难。它的失败是不可改变的。英雄的越南南方人民及其武装力量，正在北方同胞的援助下，在全世界革命人民的支持下，坚持斗争，英勇战斗，痛歼美国侵略者。毫无疑问，最后的胜利一定是属于光荣的越南人民的。
