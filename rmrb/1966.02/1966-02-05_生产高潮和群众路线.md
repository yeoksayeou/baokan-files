    The continued development of the production upsurge requires leaders at all levels to be sober promoters. Only sober promoters can achieve correct leadership in the midst of a vigorous mass movement. The report published in today's newspaper on how the Party organizations in the Guilin area of Guangxi lead agricultural production raises and answers this question with concrete facts.
    Where does correct leadership come from?
    Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "In all practical work of our Party, all correct leadership must be from the masses, to the masses."
    We must conscientiously follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and conscientiously implement the mass line.
    All plans, programs, targets, and measures proposed by leading organs must be taken to the masses for discussion and tested by practice. When Quanzhou County promoted improved varieties, it required some production teams to implement "early rice dwarfing" completely, but the masses disagreed. Why? Because if all the short-stalk rice is planted and harvested at the same time, it would be unfavorable for arranging labor to seize the season. This is the actual situation, which the leaders had not considered in advance. Therefore, to make the leadership's ideas conform to reality, they must be discussed by the masses so that incorrect ideas can be corrected and incomplete ideas can be supplemented.
    In the process of implementing the plan, we must also constantly listen to the opinions of the masses and revise the plan in a timely manner according to the opinions of the masses to make the plan more in line with reality. The Guilin Prefectural Committee proactively reduced the water conservancy construction plan based on the actual situation, which not only made the water conservancy project plan more in line with reality but also benefited the overall production arrangement.
    Mobilizing the masses to discuss work plans and inspect work plans is not only a process for leaders to educate and mobilize the masses, but also a process for the masses to educate leaders and improve their leadership level.
    Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "Determining the work policy according to the actual situation is the most basic working method that all Communists must firmly remember. The errors we have made, after studying the reasons for their occurrence, are all due to our departure from the actual situation at that time and place, and subjectively determining our own work policy." The key to implementing Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction is to adhere to the mass line.
    To follow the mass line, we must consciously and conscientiously believe in and rely on the masses, consult with the masses on everything, and be good at concentrating the opinions of the masses. This requires correcting the practice of only listening to the opinions of cadres and only consulting with cadres. Having only cadres in mind and not the masses is the cadre line, not the mass line. Although there are many grassroots cadres, they are still a minority compared to the broad masses. Only by listening to the opinions of the broad masses, including grassroots cadres, can leadership conform to objective reality. Matters need to be handled by the masses. Even if grassroots cadres understand and agree with a problem, the masses may not understand or agree. One important reason why some work is difficult to do or does not achieve the expected results is that the work has not been truly carried out among the masses.
    Grassroots cadres are the link between leading organs and the masses. Party leading organs should help grassroots cadres improve their political consciousness and learn to follow the mass line. If the opinions of the masses are inconsistent with the requirements of higher-level leading organs, do not simply ask grassroots cadres to only listen to the opinions of leaders and not the opinions of the masses. We must enable grassroots cadres to truly proceed from reality and implement the instructions and decisions of higher authorities in a pragmatic manner, rather than blindly and mechanically implementing the instructions and decisions of higher authorities. If the requirements of the higher authorities do not conform to the local reality, they should responsibly report the situation to the higher authorities, put forward their opinions, and ask the higher authorities to reconsider them; if the instructions and decisions of the higher authorities conform to the local reality, but the masses cannot accept them for the time being, they can only adopt the method of persuasion and education and make the necessary wait, but cannot adopt the method of coercion and command. Anything the masses are unwilling to do, if forced upon them, will inevitably fail.
    All revolutionary undertakings are undertakings of the masses seeking their own liberation, and all require the masses to consciously and voluntarily engage in struggle. We must highlight politics in everything we do, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the masses, and raise the consciousness of the masses so that the masses can unite and fight for their own interests. It is common for the masses to not accept certain good intentions of the leading organs for the time being. In this case, it is even more necessary to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, welcome everyone to discuss and debate, not be afraid of "butting heads," and not be afraid of raising opposing opinions. In some places in the Guilin area, in order to increase grain production, it was proposed to change from single-season rice to double-season rice. How much to change and how to change it once caused the masses to "butt heads" with the cadres. At this time, the Party organization mobilized the masses to conduct discussions, and everyone debated for the truth, listening to whoever was right. As a result, the problem was solved very well, the thinking of cadres and the masses was unified, the arrangement of the production plan was more in line with reality, and the measures taken to increase production were more reasonable.
    Developing and protecting the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses is a major issue that leading organs should pay attention to at all times. When the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses is high, and when the leading organs point to where, the masses will fight there, the leading organs should be more cautious in setting production targets and proposing production measures, resolutely rely on the masses, listen more to the opinions of the masses, and respect the experience of the masses. If the leading organs are overwhelmed by enthusiasm and force the masses to implement high targets and untested measures, they will become detached from reality and the masses. Facts have proved that high targets that are divorced from reality and impractical measures not only fail to play a promotional role but also dampen the enthusiasm of the masses. As long as we fully believe in and rely on the masses, we will be able to propose advanced and reasonable targets and formulate reliable measures.
    Resolutely and conscientiously implementing the mass line is a reliable guarantee for being a truly sober promoter. In this regard, our experience is very rich. Correctly and comprehensively developing our experience can promote the healthy development of the production upsurge.

### 生产高潮和群众路线

    生产高潮和群众路线
    生产高潮的持续发展，要求各级领导做好冷静的促进派。只有冷静的促进派，才能在轰轰烈烈的群众运动中实现正确的领导。今天本报发表的广西桂林地区党组织领导农业生产的报道，用具体的事实提出和回答了这个问题。
    正确的领导从哪里来？
    毛泽东同志告诉我们：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。”
    我们必须认真按照毛泽东同志的指示，认真贯彻执行群众路线。
    领导机关提出的一切方案、计划、指标、措施，都要拿到群众中去讨论，都要由实践来检验。全州县在推广良种的时候，要求有的生产队全部实现“早稻矮化”，群众不同意。为什么？因为如果全部种了矮秆稻，同一个时间收获，不利于安排劳力抢季节。这是实际情况，是领导者事先没有考虑到的。因之，要使领导方面的设想符合实际，就必须经过群众的讨论，使不正确的得到纠正，不完整的得到补充。
    在执行计划的过程中，同样要不断地听取群众的意见，根据群众的意见，及时修改计划，使计划更加符合实际。桂林地委根据实际情况主动地削减水利建设计划，不但使水利工程计划能够比较符合实际，而且有利于整个生产的安排。
    发动群众讨论工作计划，检查工作计划，这不但是领导者教育群众、动员群众的过程，同样是群众教育领导、提高领导水平的过程。
    毛泽东同志告诉我们：“按照实际情况决定工作方针，这是一切共产党员所必须牢牢记住的最基本的工作方法。我们所犯的错误，研究其发生的原因，都是由于我们离开了当时当地的实际情况，主观地决定自己的工作方针。”执行毛泽东同志这个指示的关键，就是坚持群众路线。
    走群众路线，就要自觉地、认真地相信群众，依靠群众，凡事和群众商量，善于集中群众的意见。这就必须纠正只听干部意见、只和干部商量的作法。眼里只有干部，没有群众，就是干部路线，不是群众路线。基层干部虽多，比起广大群众来，毕竟还是少数。只有倾听包括基层干部在内的广大群众的意见，领导才能符合客观实际。事情要群众来办，基层干部认识了、同意了的问题，群众不一定认识，不一定同意。有些工作做起来所以吃力，或者没有达到预期的结果，其中一个重要原因，就是没有把工作真正做到群众中去。
    基层干部是领导机关和群众之间的纽带。党的领导机关应当帮助基层干部提高政治觉悟，学会走群众路线。如果群众的意见跟上级领导机关的要求不一致，不要简单地要求基层干部只听领导的意见，不听群众的意见。要使基层干部真正从实际出发，实事求是地执行上级的指示和决定，而不是盲目地、机械地执行上级的指示和决定。如果上级的要求确实不符合当地的实际，就应该负责地向上级反映情况，提出意见，请上级重新加以考虑；如果上级的指示和决定符合当地的实际，而群众一时还未能接受，也只能采取说服教育的方法，并且作必要的等待，而不能采取强迫命令的方法。凡是群众不愿干的事情，硬要群众去干，结果必然失败。
    一切革命事业都是群众自求解放的事业，都需要群众自觉自愿地进行斗争。我们要时时事事突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装群众，提高群众的觉悟，使群众能够为了自己的利益，团结起来，进行斗争。对领导机关的某些良好的愿望，群众一时不能接受的事情是常有的。遇到这种情况，更加需要虚心倾听群众的意见，欢迎大家议论纷纷，不怕“顶牛”，不怕提反对意见。桂林地区的一些地方为了增加粮食生产，提出改单季稻为双季稻，究竟要改多少，要怎样改，群众一度跟干部顶了“牛”。在这种时候，党组织发动群众进行讨论，大家为真理而辩论，谁对听谁的。结果，问题解决的很好，干部、群众的思想都通了，生产计划的安排更加符合实际，采取的增产措施也更加合理。
    发扬和保护群众的革命热情，是领导机关随时要注意的一件大事。在干部、群众热情高涨的时候，在领导机关指到那里、群众就打到那里的时候，领导机关定生产指标，提生产措施，更要小心谨慎，坚决依靠群众，多听群众的意见，尊重群众的经验。如果领导机关被热情冲昏头脑，拿高指标和未经试验的措施，强制群众执行，就会脱离实际，脱离群众。事实证明，脱离实际的高指标，不切实际的措施，不仅起不了促进的作用，反而会挫伤群众的积极性。我们只要充分相信群众，依靠群众，就一定能够提出先进的合理的指标，制定可靠的措施。
    坚决地、认真地执行群众路线，是作一个真正的冷静促进派的可靠保证。在这方面，我们的经验是很丰富的。正确地、全面地发扬我们的经验，就可以促进生产高潮健康地发展。
