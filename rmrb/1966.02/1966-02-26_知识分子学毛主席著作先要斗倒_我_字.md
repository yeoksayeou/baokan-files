　　Intellectuals Must Overcome "Self" When Studying Chairman Mao's Writings
　　Medical and Health Personnel in the Capital Enthusiastically Discuss How to Study Chairman Mao's Writings Well
    Comrade Lu Dingyi said at the meeting: To do a good job in the medical and health sector, it is necessary to be ideologically strong and technically proficient. Being ideologically strong is the foundation of being technically proficient. To be ideologically strong, we must highlight politics and use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, February 25th, what problems should intellectuals bring when studying Chairman Mao's writings, and how can they study Chairman Mao's writings well? The recent symposium on studying Chairman Mao's writings in the capital's medical and health circles held a heated discussion on this issue.
    The symposium was convened by the Political Department of the Ministry of Health of the CPC. More than a thousand people attended the meeting, including experts in traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the capital, medical and scientific research workers, young medical and nursing staff, and leading party and administrative cadres of medical and health units.
    During the meeting, Lu Dingyi, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, spoke at the meeting and gave important instructions on how intellectuals should study Chairman Mao's writings. He said that to do a good job in the medical and health sector, it is necessary to be ideologically strong and technically proficient. Being ideologically strong is the foundation of being technically proficient. To be ideologically strong, we must highlight politics and use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle. He encouraged medical and health personnel to learn and apply Chairman Mao's writings flexibly, focusing on the "application" aspect, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds, transform their outlook on life and world, and become revolutionary medical and health workers who are both red and expert, considering the characteristics of intellectuals.
    To realize the revolutionization of health work, we must first promote the ideological revolutionization of medical and health personnel.
    The medical and health personnel who attended the symposium carefully discussed Comrade Lu Dingyi's instructions and exchanged their experiences and understandings in studying Chairman Mao's writings. They cited many facts to illustrate that without ideological strength, there is no technical proficiency; to realize the revolutionization of health work, we must first promote the ideological revolutionization of medical and health personnel. The medical and health sector must conscientiously implement Chairman Mao's instructions that politics is the commander and soul, correctly handle the relationship between politics and professional work, that is, the relationship between "redness" and "expertise," use politics to command professional work, use "redness" to promote "expertise," and place the study of Chairman Mao's writings at the top of all work. Lin Qiaozhi, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and an expert in obstetrics and gynecology, said that if a doctor does not have a heart to serve the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly, no matter how good their skills are, mistakes are inevitable. In the obstetrics and gynecology department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, which she led, there were cases: during a common gynecological minor surgery, individual experienced doctors made mistakes and accidents more than once, while a trained nurse performed seven hundred cases in a row without a single accident. This is because some doctors, although experienced, did not have a strong sense of responsibility; while this nurse had a heart to serve the people wholeheartedly and treated each surgery as if it were the first time, being serious, responsible, and cautious. Lin Qiaozhi also examined the past tendency of focusing only on professional work and neglecting political and ideological education in her medical education work, and expressed that she must focus on ideological transformation and flexibly apply Chairman Mao's writings in the future.
    Wherever politics is highlighted well and Chairman Mao's writings are studied well, the work is lively and creative.
    From the speeches at the symposium, it can be seen that wherever the unit highlights politics well and studies Chairman Mao's writings well, the work is done lively and creatively; whoever learns and applies Chairman Mao's writings well will have good ideology and good work. Some researchers at the Institute of Antibiotics of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences previously started from their personal fame, fortune, and interests, and simply engaged in detached "theoretical" research, resulting in long-term failure to produce results. In the past year or so, they criticized the bourgeois ideology and metaphysical viewpoints in research work, clarified the purpose of "conducting scientific research for the revolution," straightened out the research direction, and finally broke through various foreign frameworks, blazed a new path, and screened and successfully trial-produced several new antibiotics with good curative effects in a relatively short period of time. The internal medicine wards of the First Affiliated Hospital of Beijing Medical College and the Affiliated Hospital of Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, by flexibly studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings, vigorously grasped the ideological education of medical personnel, and carried out ideological and political work to patients and their families, and the ward work showed a revolutionary new atmosphere, which not only improved the quality and effectiveness of medical treatment, but also reduced the burden on patients. Li Zhishan, assistant researcher at the Institute of Blood Transfusion and Hematology of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Zhou Yulan, head nurse of the burn ward of Beijing Children's Hospital, Hong Min, director of the Department of Stomatology of the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army, and Wang Yunzhao, director of the Department of Radiology of Beijing Jishuitan Hospital, also introduced their gains in using Mao Zedong Thought to guide work and research.
    We must flexibly study and apply Chairman Mao's writings, focusing on the common problems most likely to occur among intellectuals.
    The medical and health personnel attending the symposium believed, based on their own experiences, that the medical and health team is a team concentrated with intellectuals, and medical and health personnel must flexibly study and apply Chairman Mao's writings, focusing on the common problems most likely to occur among intellectuals, such as individualism, contempt for the working people, fear of difficulties, arrogance and complacency, and subjectivism, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds, and transform their outlook on life and world. Specifically, it is necessary to solve the following problems through studying Chairman Mao's writings: First, break down bourgeois individualism, achieve not seeking fame or fortune, not fearing hardship or death, serving the people completely and thoroughly, and serving the people wholeheartedly as diligent servants; second, change the old master attitude of standing above the working people and looking down on the working people, go to the workers and peasants, combine with them, learn from them, and serve them; third, in the face of difficulties, especially in the face of great difficulties and major political storms, not be afraid, not waver, be able to move forward courageously, know the difficulties and advance, persist in the struggle, and persist in the revolution; fourth, oppose arrogance and complacency, self-imposed limitations, use the one-divides-into-two viewpoint to view the achievements and shortcomings of oneself or others, focus on shortcomings when looking at oneself, focus on strengths when looking at others, find gaps, and make continuous progress; fifth, learn and use Chairman Mao's dialectical materialist worldview and the working method of going deep into practice and conducting investigations and research, solve the problems in medical and health work, and overcome subjective idealism and practices that are divorced from reality and the masses, such as empiricism, dogmatism, and metaphysics.
    To serve the people, there must be two new formulas in the mind: "Serve - Improve - Serve" and "Practice - Research - Practice."
    Many people examined their bourgeois individualist thoughts at the symposium. They realized that individualism is the root cause of all ideological problems of intellectuals. Intellectuals should first overthrow the word "self" when studying Chairman Mao's writings. Only by first solving the fundamental direction problem of "serving whom" can we solve the methodological problem of "how to serve." They said that medical and health personnel must serve the people wholeheartedly, and must change two formulas in their minds: one is to change the formula "Improve - Serve - Improve," which starts from personal fame and fortune, into the new formula "Serve - Improve - Serve," which is wholeheartedly for the people; one is to change the formula "Papers - Research - Papers," which is detached from reality like bourgeois scholars, into the new formula "Practice - Research - Practice," which conforms to Mao Zedong Thought. Li Mingxin, professor of the Department of Pathology of the Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, talked about how he criticized the idea of individualism to become famous and establish a career and began to embark on the correct path of "Practice - Research - Practice." He said that he deeply realized that only by clarifying the purpose of conducting scientific research for the revolution can one find the correct method of linking theory with practice. Zhu Yan, director of the Blood Research Office of the Institute of Internal Medicine of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said that the idea of personal individualism and fame and fortune can only be overcome through repeated struggles. Therefore, studying Chairman Mao's writings must be studied repeatedly, applied repeatedly, and repeatedly struggle with the word "self," and integrate the "self" into the revolutionary cause.
    Going to the workers and peasants and combining with the workers and peasants is a path to truly master Mao Zedong Thought.
    Some medical and health personnel who participated in rural mobile medical teams and rural socialist education movements talked about the benefits they tasted in the process of following Chairman Mao's instructions, going to the masses of workers and peasants, and combining with the masses of workers and peasants. They believe that this is a path that intellectuals must take to truly master Mao Zedong Thought. Zhang Lin, a doctor from Beijing Hospital working in a rural medical team in the suburbs of Beijing, led the entire team to adhere to the study of Chairman Mao's writings, and according to Chairman Mao's teachings, did not fear hardship, fatigue, dirt, or difficulties, diligently studied technology, and tried every means to serve the peasants, rescuing many critically ill patients under difficult conditions, and won the love of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Through practice in the countryside, Zhang Lin's thoughts and feelings have undergone great changes. He firmly stated at the meeting that he would settle down in the countryside and serve the poor and lower-middle peasants for a lifetime.
    Mao Zedong Thought saved traditional Chinese medicine and guided both Chinese and Western medicine to jointly serve the revolutionary medical cause.
    Pu Fuzhou, a famous old traditional Chinese medicine doctor at the age of eighty, enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought in his written speech. He said that the Party's policy on uniting traditional Chinese and Western medicine and inheriting and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine is an important embodiment of Mao Zedong Thought in medicine. It was Mao Zedong Thought that saved traditional Chinese medicine, which was on the verge of extinction in the old China, and guided both Chinese and Western medicine to unite and cooperate, learn from each other's strengths, and jointly serve the revolutionary medical cause. Now, Chairman Mao's writings have become his indispensable spiritual food every day. He uses the method of combining learning and application of "learning - thinking - changing" to study Chairman Mao's writings every day. He said that he would "live to old age, learn to old age, and transform to old age," and follow Chairman Mao's instructions to unite and cooperate with Western medicine, research convenient, effective, and low-cost medical methods, and serve the 500 million peasants. Chen Bangxian, the 78-year-old deputy director of the Medical History Research Office of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, insists on studying Chairman Mao's writings on his own every day. He said that after studying Chairman Mao's writings, he felt that he was getting younger and younger. He would use Chairman Mao's materialist historical view to revise the medical history he wrote in the past, so that the research of medical history would serve proletarian politics and serve the implementation of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. Zhang Xiaoqian, vice president of the China Medical University and an expert in internal medicine, talked about his experience in participating in rural mobile medical teams and expressed that he would work hard to study Chairman Mao's writings, and often use Mao Zedong Thought to examine his thoughts and actions and transform his subjective world.
    The comrades attending the symposium unanimously stated that in the future, they must hold the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, place the flexible study and application of Chairman Mao's writings at the top of all work, take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, more extensively and deeply carry out the movement of flexibly studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings, and better contribute to the realization of the Third Five-Year Plan, resolutely implement the Party and Chairman Mao's instructions on focusing on health work in the countryside, and contribute to the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

### 知识分子学毛主席著作先要斗倒“我”字

　　只有解决了“为谁服务”方向问题，才能解决好“怎样服务”方法问题
　　知识分子学毛主席著作先要斗倒“我”字
　　首都医药卫生人员热烈讨论怎样学好毛主席著作的问题
    陆定一同志到会讲话说：医药卫生部门要做好工作，必须思想过硬，技术过硬。思想过硬是技术过硬的基础。要做到思想过硬，就要突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅。
    据新华社二十五日讯　知识分子应该带着什么问题学习毛主席著作，怎样才能学好毛主席著作？最近举行的首都医药卫生界学习毛主席著作座谈会对这个问题进行了热烈的讨论。
    座谈会是由中共卫生部政治部召开的。参加会议的有首都的中西医药学专家、医药科学研究工作者、青年医疗护理人员和医疗卫生单位的党和行政领导干部一千多人。
    会议期间，中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理陆定一在会上讲了话，对知识分子如何学习毛主席著作问题作了重要指示。他说，医药卫生部门要做好工作，必须思想过硬，技术过硬。思想过硬是技术过硬的基础。要做到思想过硬，就要突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅。他勉励医药卫生人员针对知识分子的特点，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，特别在“用”字上狠下功夫，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，改造人生观和世界观，使自己成为革命的又红又专的医药卫生工作者。
    要实现卫生工作的革命化，首先要促进医药卫生人员思想的革命化。
    参加座谈会的医药卫生人员认真讨论了陆定一同志的指示，并且交流了学习毛主席著作的心得和体会。他们列举了许多事实说明：没有思想过硬，就没有技术过硬；要实现卫生工作的革命化，首先要促进医药卫生人员思想的革命化。医药卫生部门必须认真执行毛主席关于政治是统帅、是灵魂的指示，正确处理政治与业务的关系，即红与专的关系，以政治统帅业务，以红促专，把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。中国医学科学院副院长、妇产科专家林巧稚说，一个医生如果没有一颗完全彻底地为人民服务的心，技术再好，也难免出差错。在她领导的协和医院妇产科就有这样的事：在做一种普通的妇科小手术的时候，个别有经验的医生竟不止一次地发生差错和事故，而一个经过训练的护士一连做了七百例，却一次事故没有发生。这是因为，有的医生虽然有经验，但责任心不强；而这个护士有一颗全心全意为人民服务的心，每一次做手术都象做第一次手术那样认真负责，小心谨慎。林巧稚还检查了过去自己在医学教育工作中只重业务，忽视政治思想教育的倾向，表示今后一定要以思想改造为中心，活学活用毛主席著作。
    哪里突出政治好，学习毛主席著作好，哪里的工作就生动活泼、有创造性。
    从座谈会上的发言中可以看到，哪个单位突出政治好，学习毛主席著作好，哪里的工作就做得生动活泼、有创造性；哪个人活学活用毛主席著作好，他就会思想好，工作好。中国医学科学院抗菌素研究所一些研究人员，过去从个人的名利和兴趣出发，单纯去搞脱离实际的“理论”研究，结果长期做不出成果。最近一年多来，他们批判了研究工作中的资产阶级思想和形而上学的观点，明确了“为革命进行科学研究”的目的，端正了研究方向，终于打破了各种洋框框，闯出了一条新路，在比较短的时间里，筛选和试制成功好几种疗效很好的新抗菌素。北京医学院第一附属医院和北京中医学院附属医院的内科病房，通过活学活用毛主席著作，大抓医务人员的思想教育，并且把思想政治工作一直做到病人和病人家属中去，病房工作出现了革命化的新气象，既提高了医疗质量和医疗效果，也减轻了病人负担。中国医学科学院输血及血液学研究所助理研究员李志山、北京市儿童医院烧伤病房护士长周玉兰、解放军总医院口腔科主任洪民、北京市积水潭医院放射科主任王云钊等，也介绍了他们用毛泽东思想指导工作和研究的收获。
    必须针对知识分子身上最容易产生的通病，活学活用毛主席著作。
    参加座谈会的医药卫生人员根据自己的切身体会认为，医药卫生队伍是一个知识分子集中的队伍，医药卫生人员必须针对在知识分子身上最容易产生的个人主义、轻视劳动人民、害怕困难、骄傲自大和主观主义这些通病，带着这些问题活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，改造自己的人生观和世界观。具体说来，就是要通过学习毛主席著作，解决以下几个问题：第一，破掉资产阶级个人主义，做到不为名、不为利，不怕苦、不怕死，完全彻底地为人民服务，全心全意地当人民的勤务员；第二，改变站在劳动人民之上，看不起劳动人民的老爷态度，到工人农民中间去，同他们结合，向他们学习，为他们服务；第三，在困难面前，特别是在大困难和大的政治风浪面前，不害怕、不动摇，能够勇往直前，知难而进，坚持斗争，坚持革命；第四，反对骄傲自大、故步自封，用一分为二的观点看待自己或别人的成绩和缺点，看自己着重看短处，看别人着重看长处，找出差距，不断进步；第五，学习和运用毛主席的辩证唯物主义的世界观和深入实际调查研究的工作方法，解决医疗卫生工作中的问题，克服经验主义、教条主义、形而上学等主观唯心主义和脱离实际、脱离群众的作风。
    要为人民服务，头脑里要有两个新公式：“服务——提高——服务”和“实践——研究——实践”。
    许多人在座谈会上检查了自己的资产阶级个人主义思想。他们认识到个人主义是知识分子一切思想毛病的总根子，知识分子学习毛主席著作首先要把“我”字斗倒，只有首先解决了“为谁服务”这个根本方向的问题，才能解决好“怎样服务”的方法问题。他们说，医疗卫生人员要全心全意地为人民服务，必须在头脑里改变两个公式：一个是把“提高——服务——提高”这个从个人名利出发的公式，改成为“服务——提高——服务”这个一心为人民的新公式；一个是把“论文——研究——论文”这个脱离实际的资产阶级学者的公式，改成为“实践——研究——实践”这个符合毛泽东思想的新公式。中国医学科学院实验医学研究所病理系教授李铭新谈到他怎样批判个人主义成名成家的思想，开始走上“实践——研究——实践”的正确道路时说，他深深体会到，只有明确了为革命而进行科学研究的目的，才能找到理论联系实际的正确方法。中医研究院内科研究所血液研究室主任朱颜说，个人主义名利思想是要经过反复斗争才能克服的。所以，学习毛主席著作必须反复学，反复用，反复同“我”字作斗争，将“我”字溶化到革命事业当中。
    到工农中去，同工农结合，是真正把毛泽东思想学到手的一条途径。
    一些参加过农村巡回医疗队和农村社会主义教育运动的医药卫生人员，在座谈会上谈到他们按照毛主席的指示，到工农群众中去，同工农群众结合的过程中尝到的甜头。他们认为这是知识分子要真正把毛泽东思想学到手的一条非走不可的途径。在北京郊区农村医疗队工作的北京医院医生张林，带领全队坚持学习毛主席著作，按照毛主席的教导，不怕苦、不怕累、不怕脏、不怕难，刻苦钻研技术，千方百计地为农民服务，在困难的条件下抢救了许多危重病人，得到了贫农下中农的爱戴。通过在农村的实践，张林的思想感情发生了很大的变化。他在会上坚决表示要到农村去安家落户，为贫农下中农服务一辈子。
    毛泽东思想挽救了祖国医学，把中西医引导到共同为革命医学事业服务的道路上。
    八十高龄的著名老中医蒲辅周在书面发言中满腔热情地歌颂毛泽东思想。他说，党的关于团结中西医、继承和发扬祖国医学遗产的中医政策，是毛泽东思想在医学方面的重要体现。是毛泽东思想挽救了在旧中国濒于绝境的祖国医学，把中西医引导到团结合作、取长补短、共同为革命的医学事业服务的道路上。现在，毛主席著作已经是他每天不可缺少的精神食粮。他每天都要用“学——思——改”的学用结合的方法学习毛主席著作。他说他要这样“活到老，学到老，改造到老”，要遵照毛主席的指示，同西医团结合作，研究出方便、有效、花钱少的医疗方法，为五亿农民服务。七十八岁的中医研究院医史研究室副主任陈邦贤每天坚持自学毛主席著作。他说，他学了毛主席著作以后，觉得自己越活越年青了，他要用毛主席的唯物史观修改过去写的医学史，让医学史的研究为无产阶级政治服务，为贯彻党的中医政策服务。中国医科大学副校长、内科专家张孝骞谈了他参加农村巡回医疗队的体会，表示要努力学习毛主席著作，经常用毛泽东思想检查自己的思想和行动，改造自己的主观世界。
    参加座谈会的同志一致表示，今后必须更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，以焦裕禄同志为榜样，更加广泛深入地开展活学活用毛主席著作的运动，更好地为实现第三个五年计划、坚决贯彻执行党和毛主席关于把卫生工作的重点放到农村的指示，为我国人民和世界人民的革命事业作出贡献。
