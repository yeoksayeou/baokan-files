    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 2nd - The Vietnamese newspaper 《People's Daily》 published a commentary on February 2nd condemning the United States for submitting the Vietnam issue to the United Nations Security Council, pointing out that the United Nations has no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue.

    The commentary said that just as the U.S. government's "peace talks" conspiracy failed and Johnson brazenly resumed bombing North Vietnam, the United States requested the United Nations Security Council to intervene in the Vietnam issue. Obviously, this is another trick played by the American aggressors to deceive public opinion.

    The commentary said that the Vietnamese people resolutely expose this deceptive trick of U.S. imperialism and will never recognize any interference by the United Nations because the resolution of the Vietnam issue is not within the scope of the United Nations' authority.

    The commentary emphasized that U.S. imperialism is attempting to invade Vietnam with violence. The Vietnamese people are determined to stand up and defeat the aggressors with revolutionary war. The military force of U.S. imperialism cannot subdue the Vietnamese people, nor can all its threats and pressures shake the Vietnamese people's iron will to fight resolutely for their freedom and independence.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 2nd - The Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army sent an urgent telegram to the Vietnam International Commission on February 2nd, strongly protesting that multiple batches of American aircraft took off from military bases in South Vietnam and Thailand and the Seventh Fleet on February 1st to continue bombing and strafing many residential areas and economic units in Vinh City, Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as many areas in Nghệ An and Quảng Bình provinces and Hòn Gió Island in the Vĩnh Linh area.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 2nd - According to reports published here, the army and people of Nghệ An Province in North Vietnam shot down two invading American bandit planes on the morning of February 1st.

    On the morning of February 1st, American aerial bandits invaded Vinh City and Biển Thủy area of Nghệ An Province. The army and people of Nghệ An Province fiercely attacked the invading enemy and shot down one F-4 and one AD-6 enemy plane.

    越《人民报》指出联合国无权干涉越南问题
    越南人民决心用革命战争击败美国侵略者
    人民军代表团抗议美机轰炸　义安军民击落美机两架
    新华社河内二日电　越南《人民报》二日发表评论谴责美国把越南问题提交联合国安全理事会，指出联合国无权干涉越南问题。
    评论说，正当美国政府“和谈”阴谋破产，约翰逊悍然恢复轰炸越南北方的时候，美国要求联合国安全理事会来干涉越南问题。显然，这又是美国侵略者为欺骗舆论而玩弄的阴谋诡计。
    评论说，越南人民坚决揭露美帝国主义的这一欺骗手段，并且决不承认联合国的任何干涉，因为解决越南问题不属于联合国的职权范围。
    评论强调说，美帝国主义妄图以暴力来侵略越南。越南人民坚决站起来用革命战争来击败侵略者。美帝国主义的武力既不能使越南人民屈服，那么，它的一切威胁和压力也决不能动摇越南人民坚决为自己的自由和独立而战斗的钢铁意志。
    据新华社河内二日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团二日打紧急电报给越南国际委员会，强烈抗议美国飞机多批一日从越南南方、泰国各军事基地和第七舰队起飞，继续轰炸和扫射越南民主共和国荣市许多居民区和经济单位，以及义安、广平等省许多地区和永灵区的昏果岛。
    新华社河内二日电　据这里公布，越南北方义安省军民一日上午打落入侵的美国强盗飞机两架。
    一日上午，美国空中强盗侵入义安省荣市、边水地区。义安省军民痛击来犯的敌人，打落F—4型和AD—6型敌机各一架。
