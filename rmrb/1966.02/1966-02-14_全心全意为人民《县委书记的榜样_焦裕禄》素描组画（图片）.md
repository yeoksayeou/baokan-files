    The True Qualities of the Working People
    Since joining the revolution, Jiao Yulu has always maintained the true qualities of the working people, working alongside the masses in a simple and unadorned manner.

    The Good Son of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
    During days of heavy snowstorms, Jiao Yulu was anxious about the living conditions of the poor and lower-middle peasants. On this day, Jiao Yulu visited dozens of impoverished elderly peasants. When he visited the home of an elderly childless and sonless peasant, the old man was extremely moved. Jiao Yulu comforted the old man, saying: The disaster-stricken and impoverished face of Lankao will certainly be changed.
    Going Deep into Reality, Conducting Investigation and Research
    To overcome natural disasters, we must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, understand the origin and development of natural disasters, and then make correct judgments and deployments. Under the leadership of Jiao Yulu, the entire county launched a large-scale investigation and research effort to trace floods, investigate wind gaps, and explore shifting sands. Jiao Yulu, enduring severe liver pain, worked alongside comrades, rushing about in strong winds and heavy rain.
    Reading Chairman Mao's Books, Being a Good Student of Chairman Mao
    In his work, Jiao Yulu developed the habit of studying Chairman Mao's works for many years. Whether in the office or in the countryside, he always carried "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" with him. When encountering problems, he consulted Chairman Mao's works and acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions in everything he did.
    Good "Squad Leader"
    Jiao Yulu believed that the key to changing Lankao's appearance lay in the revolutionization of the thinking of the county party leadership. After a series of class education sessions and ideological struggles, the core leadership of the Lankao County Party Committee stood up in the face of natural disasters. They formulated a blueprint for transforming the nature of Lankao, determined to achieve basic victory in sand control, water control, and alkali control within three to five years.
    An Example for the People of the Whole Country to Learn From
    Jiao Yulu had deep feelings for every blade of grass and tree in Lankao. He worked alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao on the front lines of the fight against disasters. It was he who held high the red light of Mao Zedong Thought, illuminating the path of self-reliance for the people of Lankao; it was he who led the people of Lankao in reversing the situation in Lankao and inspiring people's revolutionary spirit. He is an example for the people of the whole country to learn from.

    全心全意为人民
    《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》素描组画

    劳动人民的本色
    焦裕禄参加革命以后，一直保持着劳动人民的本色，朴朴实实地同群众一起劳动。这张照片纪录了他当了县委书记以后，在田间劳动的情景。　新华社稿
    贫下中农的好儿子
    在大风雪的日子里，焦裕禄为贫下中农的生活问题焦虑不安。这一天，焦裕禄访问了几十户生活困难的老贫农。当他到一家无儿无女的老贫农家访问的时候，老人极为感动。焦裕禄安慰老人说：兰考受灾受穷的面貌一定能改变过来。
    深入实际　调查研究
    要战胜自然灾害，就必须照毛主席的指示办事，了解自然灾害的来龙去脉，然后作出正确的判断和部署。在焦裕禄领导下，全县展开了大规模的追洪水、查风口、探流沙的调查研究工作。焦裕禄带着剧烈的肝痛病，同同志们一起在大风大雨中奔波。
    读毛主席的书　做毛主席的好学生
    在工作中，焦裕禄多年来养成了学习毛主席著作的习惯。无论在办公室，还是下乡，总要把《毛泽东选集》带在身边。遇到问题就向毛主席著作请教，处处按照毛主席的指示办事。
    好“班长”
    焦裕禄认为要改变兰考面貌，关键在于县委领导思想的革命化。经过一连串的阶级教育和思想斗争，兰考县委领导核心在自然灾害面前站起来了。他们制定了一个改造兰考大自然的蓝图，决心要在三五年内取得治沙、治水、治碱的基本胜利。
    全国人民学习的榜样
    焦裕禄对兰考的一草一木都有深厚的感情。他同兰考的贫下中农一起奔波在抗灾斗争前线上。是他高举着毛泽东思想的红灯，照亮了兰考人民自力更生的道路；是他带领兰考人民扭转了兰考的局势，激发了人们的革命精神。他是全国人民学习的榜样。
