    The South Vietnamese Liberation Army usually practices bayonet fighting hard, and fully utilizes the power of close combat and night combat in battle, engaging the enemy in bayonet charges and hand-to-hand combat, using its own strengths to attack the enemy's weaknesses, and eliminating a large number of enemies. The picture shows soldiers of a certain Liberation Army unit practicing bayonet fighting.

    Under the leadership of the National Liberation Front, the vast number of peasants in the South Vietnamese liberated areas are organized to vigorously carry out the production movement, increase grain production, and support the front.

    The South Vietnamese Liberation Army is the people's own army and is deeply loved by the masses. The picture shows the masses of a certain village using fragrant and sweet coconut juice to comfort the victorious returning soldiers.
