    A non-staple food store, in order to sell more, often went to the street that another store was responsible for supplying, but rarely went to the nearby remote alleys. The leadership took administrative measures many times, but the problem was never solved. The final proof:
    Digging Out the Ideological Roots: Even "Chronic Diseases" Can Be Cured
    Our store is responsible for managing five retail stores, two of which are located in Dazhi Bridge Hutong, Xuanwai. The east entrance is Xuanwai Non-Staple Food Store No. 1, and the west entrance is Dazhi Bridge Non-Staple Food Store. The east entrance faces the street with heavy traffic. Fruits, vegetables, and meats sell quickly and in large quantities. The Dazhi Bridge Non-Staple Food Store at the west entrance, in order to sell more, often pushed carts to the street outside the east entrance to sell vegetables and fruits, or set up meat stalls. What about the nearby remote alleys? Their vegetable carts wouldn't go there even once every half month, forcing residents to walk quite a distance to buy vegetables. Xuanwai Store No. 1 had a big opinion about their "business-snatching" behavior, and nearby residents were also very dissatisfied with their inconvenience to the masses.
    In response to this situation, our Party branch conducted research and decided to prohibit them from selling goods at the east entrance, and determined the supply range for the two stores with the middle of the hutong as the boundary. For a period of time afterward, they complied relatively well. We thought the problem was solved.
    But after a while, they were again selling vegetables across the boundary. We criticized them in the general meeting and said: "We have agreed in advance, if anyone is found crossing the boundary again, they will have to make a serious self-criticism." Even so, the problem was not completely solved. They didn't cross the boundary in front of the leaders, but behind their backs, they still crossed the boundary to sell vegetables in a roundabout way.
    Seeing that demarcation didn't work, and criticism didn't work either, we transferred a vegetable team leader from Xuanwai Non-Staple Food Store No. 1 to Dazhi Bridge Store to serve as the director. He used to have the biggest opinion about the cross-boundary problem, so he wouldn't do it himself, right? However, before long, the problem happened again as before. Not only did other employees cross the boundary, but even the newly transferred director followed suit.
    Why cross the boundary? Why is the problem so difficult to solve? The Party branch carefully researched and found that in the past, we only dealt with the matter itself and did not solve the ideological problem. To solve the problem, we should start by grasping ideology. The branch decided to send me to Dazhi Bridge Non-Staple Food Store to squat.
    After I arrived at Dazhi Bridge Store, one day, a salesperson came back from selling vegetables, angrily saying: "We are always asked to go to remote alleys, and we only sell a few mao in one alley!" I felt something was wrong, so I had individual talks with relevant comrades. It turned out that when they sold vegetables on the street, they could sell forty or fifty yuan a day without moving their bodies or shaking their arms; after wandering around a remote alley, they only sold thirty cents, so they were in low spirits.
    I seized on this matter and raised the question of "for whom are we doing business" for everyone to discuss. At first, some people couldn't understand: "Selling more by crossing the boundary is also for the store, not putting it in our own pockets, what's wrong with that? If we don't do this, the vegetables will rot and we'll lose money, what should we do?" I told everyone in the discussion meeting that if everyone wanted to sell more and went to the street, residents in remote alleys would have to walk a long distance, how can this be said to be "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people? I also organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's article "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work", and organized everyone to use the "Backpack Store" as a mirror to examine themselves. The comrades' minds opened up. Some said: "The 'Backpack Store' does business for the revolution, while we do business only to make money, what a huge gap!" Some said: "In the past, although we demarcated the boundary, and the leaders didn't let us go, we didn't demarcate it ideologically. As soon as we thought about selling more money, we didn't care about anything else. In the future, we must supply the residents in this area well, this is the only way to truly complete the task."
      The problem of "for whom are we doing business" was solved. However, some employees were still worried that there would not be many people buying vegetables in remote alleys. In order to solve this problem, we visited local residents. Some residents said: "Your vegetable carts don't come regularly, three days of fishing, two days of drying nets, sometimes not coming once every half month. If we have to wait for you to deliver vegetables, we would have starved long ago!" Some also said that the vegetable carts move too fast and don't carry a full range of varieties. The facts educated everyone. It turned out that it was not that no one bought vegetables, but that we did not serve well.
    The store organized employees to discuss improvement methods, implemented fixed personnel, fixed carts, fixed times, and fixed location supply, and delivered vegetables to the door on time every day. The cart added goods such as liquor and small condiments. On Saturdays and Sundays, meat stalls were added in nearby alleys. Temporary sales points were also set up during the peak season for vegetables and fresh fruits. In this way, residents could buy satisfactory things at their doorsteps. The store's sales tasks were completed better than in the past, and there was no phenomenon of rotten vegetables or losing money. The problem of cross-boundary selling of vegetables was completely solved.

### 挖出思想根　“痼疾”也能除

专栏：

    一个副食商店为了多卖钱，常到另一个商店负责供应的大街上去卖菜，附近偏僻胡同却很少去。领导上多次采取行政措施，一直没有解决问题。最后证明：
    挖出思想根　“痼疾”也能除
    我们店负责管理五个零售商店，其中两个都设在宣外达智桥胡同。东口是宣外副食一店，西口是达智桥副食店。东口面临大街，来往人多，水果、蔬菜、肉类都销得又多又快。西口的达智桥副食商店为了多卖钱，也常常推车子到东口外的大街上卖菜卖水果，或者摆肉摊。附近偏僻胡同呢？他们的菜车半个月也不去一次，居民买菜要走不少路。宣外一店对他们“抢生意”的作法意见很大，附近居民对他们不方便群众也很不满意。
    针对这种情况，我们党支部做了研究，决定不让他们出车到东口卖货，并且确定两家的供应范围以胡同中间为界。以后一段时间，他们遵守得比较好。我们认为问题已经解决了。
    可是过了不久，他们又跨界卖菜了。我们就在大会上对他们进行了批评，并且说：“咱们有言在先，今后再发现谁跨界，就得好好检讨。”就这样，问题也没有得到彻底解决。他们当着领导的面不跨界，背着领导，还是拐弯抹角地跨界卖菜。
    我们见到划界不行，批评也不行，就从宣外副食一店调了一名蔬菜组长到达智桥商店去担任主任。他过去对跨界问题意见最大，自己总不会这样办吧。可是，时间过了不长，问题又照样发生了。不仅别的职工跨界，连新调去的主任也跟着跨界了。
    为什么跨界？为什么问题这么难解决？党支部仔细作了研究，原来过去只是就事论事，没有解决思想问题。要解决问题，应当从抓思想入手。支部便决定让我去达智桥副食店蹲点。
    我到达智桥商店以后，有一天，一位售货员卖菜回来，生气地说：“老叫串偏僻胡同，一条胡同才卖几毛钱！”我听了觉得不对茬，就找有关的同志个别谈话。原来他们到大街卖菜，身不动，膀不摇，一天能卖四五十元；在一条偏僻胡同转游了一圈，才卖三毛钱，因此情绪不高。
    我就抓住这件事，提出“为谁做买卖”的问题让大家讨论。起先，有些人想不通：“跨界多卖钱，也是为了商店，又不是装进自己腰包，有啥不好的？不这么做，烂了菜，赔了钱，怎么办？”我就在座谈会上对大伙讲，如果都为了多卖钱，都到大街上去卖，偏僻胡同居民就得跑远路，这怎么能说是“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务呢？我又组织大伙学习毛主席的文章《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》，并且组织大家以“背篓商店”为镜子，对照检查自己。同志们的思想开朗了。有的说：“人家‘背篓商店’是为革命做生意，而我们做生意只是为了赚钱，差距多远啊！”有的说：“过去虽说划了界，领导不让去，可是思想上没有划界，一想到多卖钱，啥都不管啦。今后一定要对本片居民供应好，这样才算真正完成任务。”
      “为谁做买卖”的问题解决了。可是，有些职工还担心到偏僻胡同里送货上门，也没有多少人买。为了解决这个问题，我们访问了当地居民。有的居民说：“你们的菜车不定时来，三天打鱼，两天晒网，有时候半个月不来一趟。我们要等着你们来送菜，早就饿扁啦！”也有的说菜车走的太快，带的品种不全。事实教育了大家。原来不是没有人买菜，而是因为我们服务得不好。
    店里组织职工讨论改进的办法，实行了定人、定车、定时、定地点供应，每天都按时送菜上门。车上增加了酒类和小调料等商品。星期六、星期日在附近胡同增设了肉摊。在蔬菜和鲜果旺季，还设立临时售货点。这样，居民在家门口就能买到称心如意的东西了。商店的销售任务完成得比过去还好，并没有发生烂菜、赔钱现象。跨界卖菜的问题，才彻底解决了。
