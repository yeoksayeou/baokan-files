    Replacing Cumbersome Operations with Advanced Operations
    Fuxin Haizhou Coal Mine Adopts Heavy Medium Coal Separation Method
    Greatly Improving Coal Washing Efficiency, Coal Gangue Content Nears Zero
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang) The coal preparation plant of Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Mine has adopted the very advanced heavy medium coal separation method, replacing the original manual coal selection method.
    The new coal separation method is much superior to the manual coal selection method. During manual coal selection, workers stood on both sides of the conveyor belt to pick out gangue. Each person had to pick out ten to twelve tons of gangue per shift, and the labor intensity was very high. At the same time, because coal lumps collided with each other on the belt, coal dust flew in the room, affecting workers' health. After using heavy medium coal separation, manual coal picking has been completely replaced by machinery. Moreover, the coal selection efficiency has been greatly improved compared with manual labor. The gangue content in the selected coal is close to zero, and the coal content in the gangue has also dropped from the original 12 per thousand to 3 per thousand.
    The operation process of heavy medium coal separation is as follows: Stir and mix magnetite powder and water into a suspension of a certain specific gravity, put it into the separation machine, and then let the coal containing gangue pass through the separation machine. Because the specific gravity of the suspension is between the specific gravity of coal and gangue, the coal floats on the top when passing through the separation machine, and is sent to the coal car after being dehydrated by the screening machine; the gangue naturally sinks when passing through the separation machine, and falls into the gangue car after being dewatered by the dewatering screen.

    用先进的操作代替笨重的操作
    阜新海州煤矿采用重介质选煤法
    选煤效率提高很多，煤含矸量接近于零
    据新华社沈阳电　阜新海州露天矿选煤厂已经采用很先进的重介质选煤法，代替了原来采用的人工选煤法。
    新的选煤法比人工选煤法优越得多。人工选煤的时候，工人站在输送带两侧拣选矸石，每人每班要拣出十吨到十二吨矸石，劳动强度很大。同时由于煤块在皮带上互相撞击，室内煤尘飞扬，影响工人身体健康，采用重介质选煤之后，人工拣煤已完全由机械所代替，而且选煤效率比用人工提高很多，选出的煤含矸量接近于零，矸石里的含煤量也从原来的千分之十二下降到千分之三。
    重介质选煤的操作过程是这样的：把磁铁矿粉和水搅拌混合成一定比重的悬浮液，放入选分机内，然后让含矸石的煤通过选分机。由于悬浮液的比重介于煤和矸石的比重之间，煤通过选分机的时候漂浮在上面，经筛分机脱水后送入煤车；矸石通过选分机的时候自然下沉，经脱水筛脱水后掉进矸石车。
