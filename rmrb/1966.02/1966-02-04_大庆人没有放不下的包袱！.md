    "Daqing People Have No Burdens They Can't Let Go Of!"
    Yu Jun
    Some comrades might find this title strange at first glance: the whole country is learning from Daqing, what burdens could the people of Daqing still have?
      "Daqing People Have No Burdens They Can't Let Go Of!" These words were spoken by Comrade Wen Jingui, a Communist Party member and leader of the First Drilling Team of the Fourth Team of the Third Mining Area of the Daqing Oilfield. I heard this with my own ears at a meeting of the First Drilling Team, without adding or subtracting a single word. Comrade Wen Jingui has always been active in his work, but in recent years, a burden has gradually formed on his back: "A roughneck, almost forty years old, not much future!" Therefore, in his work, he somewhat held the idea that as long as he got by and didn't make mistakes, that was enough. Through the socialist education movement, he consciously let go of this burden and said: "The whole country is learning from Daqing, we should be even more revolutionized. Daqing people have no burdens they can't let go of!"
    Comrade Mao Zedong said more than twenty years ago: "Many people in the proletariat still retain the thinking of the petty bourgeoisie." This statement is still applicable today. The workers of Daqing put it well: "Class struggle exists internationally, domestically, in the countryside, in enterprises, in the battle corps, in our own units, and in our own minds!" A worker from the Fourth Team of the Third Mining Area said:
  "Bourgeois ideology is invisible, and if we don't heighten our vigilance, we will be infected without realizing it. If we are not clear-headed, we will make mistakes no matter how good our background is." People are products of society. Each of us lives in this society full of class struggle, and we are affected by the objective environment. We often have various burdens, but some have more, some have less, some are larger, some are smaller, some have already let go, and some have not yet let go.
    Who can be without the task of transforming the subjective world? The famous Wang Tie, wasn't born a "Iron Man." After liberation, he initially only had the thought of repaying the Party. The thought of repaying favors is not the thorough revolutionary thought of the proletariat. Bethune's coming to China and Luo Shengjiao's saving Cui Ying were not for repaying any favors. Wang Tie, also under the education of the Party, connected his work with the class brothers all over the world and gradually grew into a resounding proletarian "Iron Man." Wang Tie is a representative of the revolutionary people of Daqing, and his early thought of repaying favors was not disreputable. But this shows that everyone has a process of constantly letting go of burdens and transforming the subjective world.
      "Daqing People Have No Burdens They Can't Let Go Of!" Well said! When we say we want to learn from the people of Daqing, we are not saying that the thoughts of the people of Daqing are already perfect. There is no perfect person in the world; moreover, Daqing is such a large enterprise, and the people of Daqing come from all over the country, originating from different classes, how could they all have no burdens? The precious thing about the people of Daqing is that they are clear-headed, they emphasize politics at all times and in all places, they hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, they constantly carry out the struggle of promoting the proletarian and eliminating the bourgeois, and they use the righteousness of proletarian ideology to overwhelm the evil wind of bourgeois ideology; it lies in the spirit of "no burdens they can't let go of."
    "Daqing People Have No Burdens They Can't Let Go Of!" This is the spirit of continuous revolution of the proletariat!

### “大庆人没有放不下的包袱！”

    “大庆人没有放不下的包袱！”
    郁军
    有的同志一看这题目，也许会奇怪：全国都在学大庆，大庆人还会有什么包袱呀？
      “大庆人没有放不下的包袱！”说这话的是共产党员、大庆油田三矿四队第一井组井长文金贵同志。这是我在第一井组的一次会上亲耳听到的，没有给它加或减一个字。文金贵同志，工作一向积极，但近年来背上也逐渐形成了一个包袱：“大老粗，快四十的人了，没多大前途了！”因此，工作上多少有点过得去、不出错就算了的思想。通过社会主义教育运动，他自觉地放下了包袱，并且说：“全国学大庆，我们更应该革命化。大庆人没有放不下的包袱！”
    毛泽东同志在二十多年前说过：“无产阶级中还有许多人保留着小资产阶级的思想”。这句话在今天，也还是适用的。大庆的工人说得好：“阶级斗争国际上有，国内有，农村有，企业有，会战队伍有，本单位有，自己脑袋里也有！”三矿四队的一个工人说：
  “资产阶级思想是无形的，不提高警惕，不知不觉就会沾上。头脑不清醒，出身再好也会犯错误。”人是社会的产物，我们每个人生活在这个充满阶级斗争的社会里，受着客观环境的影响，常常会有这样那样的包袱，只不过有人多、有人少、有人大、有人小、有人已经放下、有人还没有放下罢了。
    谁能没有改造主观世界的任务呢？大名鼎鼎的王铁人，也不是一生下来就是个“铁人”的。他在解放以后，早先也只有对党报恩的思想。报恩思想，不是无产阶级彻底革命的思想。白求恩来中国、罗盛教救崔?，就不是为了报什么恩。王铁人，也是在党的教育下，才把自己的工作和全世界阶级弟兄联系起来、逐步成长为一个响当当的无产阶级“铁人”的。王铁人是革命的大庆人的代表，他早先那种报恩思想，也不是见不得人的。但这说明：任何人都有一个不断放包袱、改造主观世界的过程。
      “大庆人没有放不下的包袱！”说得好啊！我们说要向大庆人学习，不是说大庆人的思想已经很完美了。世界上没有完美无疵的人；何况大庆是那么大的一个企业，大庆人又来自五湖四海，出身于不同的阶级，他们怎会通通都没有包袱了呢？大庆人的可贵之处，在于他们头脑清醒，时时处处突出政治，高举毛泽东思想红旗，不断进行兴无灭资的斗争，用无产阶级思想的正气，去压倒资产阶级思想的歪风；在于那种“没有放不下的包袱”的精神。
    “大庆人没有放不下的包袱！”这就是无产阶级不断革命的精神！
