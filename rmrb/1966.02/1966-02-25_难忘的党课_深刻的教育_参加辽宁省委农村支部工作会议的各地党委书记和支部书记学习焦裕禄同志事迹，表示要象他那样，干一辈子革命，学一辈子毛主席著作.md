　　Unforgettable Party Class　Profound Education
    Party Committee Secretaries and Branch Secretaries from Various Regions Attending the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee Rural Branch Work Conference Study Comrade Jiao Yulu's Deeds, Expressing Their Determination to Engage in Revolution for a Lifetime and Study Chairman Mao's Writings for a Lifetime.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 24th, "Learn from Jiao Yulu, serve the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly with deep class feelings like him!" This is the common sentiment expressed by more than 1,100 prefectural committee, county committee, commune party committee, and production brigade branch secretaries attending the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee Rural Branch Work Conference.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds inspired the party committee secretaries and branch secretaries from various regions attending the conference. They requested that the conference specifically allocate more than two days for study and discussion. Some comrades even impatiently wrote letters or made phone calls to their counties, communes, or brigades, urging cadres in their units to study Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds deeply and thoroughly to promote the revolutionization of leadership.
    At the conference, everyone used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to examine their own thoughts in light of Jiao Yulu. They said that this study provided them with a vivid and profound education, an unforgettable Party class. Through this study, they clarified how they should better carry out the revolution for the rest of their lives. Many comrades acknowledged that Jiao Yulu shared the fate of the people of Lankao County, his roots were deeply planted in the hearts of poor and lower-middle peasants, he loved the people, and the people loved him. Compared to Comrade Jiao Yulu, we are not just a little bit behind, but far behind. County party committee secretaries from low-yield areas stated that Comrade Jiao Yulu always thought of the 360,000 people of Lankao in everything he did, daring to weigh the severity of Lankao's "three scourges." We should also weigh the severity of our region's "three scourges" and "four pests," and we will not rest in peace until we quickly change the face of poverty. Party committee secretaries from high-yield areas reviewed that in the past, they were satisfied with "no need for oil for lamps, sitting on heated brick beds to watch operas, no need for oxen to plow the fields." They did not have the lofty ambition to embrace the motherland and have a global vision. They are determined not to be satisfied with existing achievements and strive for greater progress.
    Many county committee secretaries conducted serious self-criticisms, demanding high standards of themselves, and resolved to catch up. Everyone profoundly realized that compared to Comrade Jiao Yulu, there are thousands of differences, but the most fundamental one is the failure to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought well. Everyone expressed that in the future, they must be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, engage in revolution for a lifetime, and study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime. As long as we arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, we can be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, serve the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly with class feelings, and be good cadres in the style of Jiao Yulu.

　　难忘的党课　深刻的教育
    参加辽宁省委农村支部工作会议的各地党委书记和支部书记学习焦裕禄同志事迹，表示要象他那样，干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席著作
    据新华社沈阳二十四日电  “学习焦裕禄，象他那样带着浓厚的阶级感情，完全彻底地为人民服务！”这是参加中共辽宁省委农村支部工作会议的一千一百多名地委、县委书记、公社党委书记、生产大队支部书记发出的共同语言。
    焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹，鼓舞了出席这次会议的各地党委书记和支部书记。他们要求会议专门划出两天多的时间进行学习讨论。有些同志还迫不及待地给本县、本公社、本大队写信或打电话，要求本单位的干部把焦裕禄同志的事迹学深学透，促进领导革命化。
    会上，大家以毛泽东思想为武器，对照着焦裕禄，检查自己的思想。他们说，这次学习使自己受到了一次生动、深刻的教育，上了一次难忘的党课。通过这次学习，明确了后半辈子应该怎样更好地革命。许多同志检查说，焦裕禄和兰考县人民同呼吸共命运，他的根子扎在贫农下中农心里，他爱人民，人民爱他。我们和焦裕禄同志比起来，不是差一星半点，而是差得太远了。低产地区的县委书记们表示，焦裕禄同志处处事事想的是兰考三十六万人民，敢于掂一掂兰考“三害”的分量。我们也应掂一掂本地区“三害”、“四害”的分量，不迅速改变贫困面貌，死不瞑目。丰产地区的党委书记检查，过去认为“点灯不用油，听戏坐炕头，种地不用牛”，这样就满足了，就是没有胸怀祖国，放眼世界的雄心大志，他们决心不满足已有的成绩，争取更先进。
    许多县委书记认真作了检查，以高标准要求自己，决心迎头赶上去。大家深刻认识到，和焦裕禄同志相比，差距有千条万条，最根本的一条是没有很好地活学活用毛泽东思想。大家纷纷表示：今后一定要象焦裕禄同志那样，干一辈子革命，学习一辈子毛主席著作。只要用毛泽东思想武装自己，就可以象焦裕禄同志那样，带着阶级感情去完全彻底地为人民服务，做焦裕禄式的好干部。
