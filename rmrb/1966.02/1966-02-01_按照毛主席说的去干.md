    Mai Xiande had just received his second allowance since joining the army when he heard that a Xinhua Bookstore mobile sales team had come to the barracks to sell books. He ran to the book-selling area in one breath. The crowd was full of book stalls, and he squeezed in hard, quickly picking out three books: "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." He pressed the books tightly against his chest, as if afraid someone would snatch them away.

    Mai Xiande carried Chairman Mao's books with him, reading them whenever he had time, even using the few minutes before the movie started and before lights out. Someone asked him, "Life in the army is so intense, do you have time to study?" He thought for a moment and said seriously, "Comrade Lei Feng said that learning requires a 'nail' spirit; if you can drill and squeeze, you will have time." There was a period when the electricity went out frequently at night, so Mai Xiande made a small oil lamp out of a glass bottle, and he lit it whenever the electricity went out. Reading Chairman Mao's books in the dim light, he felt his heart as warm and bright as if filled with sunshine.

    Mai Xiande is best at connecting theory with practice when reading Chairman Mao's books. He learns and applies what he learns, learning a little and applying a little. (Editor's note: This "learn a little and apply a little" is very important. Mai Xiande, Lei Feng, and Wang Jie all have this characteristic, which is worth learning from. The most valuable aspect of their study of Chairman Mao's works is that they can connect it with reality—connecting it with their own thoughts, work, and life, reading it once, thinking about it once, learning a little, and applying a little, very practically. Only with this practical spirit in learning can one become a strong revolutionary fighter.) When he first joined the army, he missed home a bit. After reading "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he examined himself and quickly settled down. There was a new recruit in the squad who also missed home and whose emotions often fluctuated. Mai Xiande thought: Chairman Mao said that we all come from all corners of the country and have come together for a common revolutionary goal. Everyone in the revolutionary ranks should care for, love, and help each other. I should help my comrades more! Mai Xiande first took care of this comrade enthusiastically in life, washing his dirty clothes, washing them several times in a row. The two became very close, and Mai Xiande then studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with him, discussing their feelings while reading. The more they talked, the more enthusiastic they became, and the new recruit said excitedly, "Bethune was a foreigner who worked wholeheartedly for the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. If I don't work hard, I'll be letting down the Party and the motherland!" Mai Xiande shook his hand happily: "Yes, we come to make revolution to fight all reactionaries to the end!"

    按照毛主席说的去干
    麦贤得刚领到入伍后的第二次津贴费，听说新华书店流动售书组到营区卖书来了。他一口气跑到卖书的地方。人群围满了书摊，他使劲挤进去，赶快拣了三本：《为人民服务》《愚公移山》《纪念白求恩》，他把书紧紧地按在胸前，好象怕别人抢去似的。
    麦贤得把毛主席的书带在身上，有空就看，连放电影前、熄灯前的几分钟他也不放过。有人问他：“部队生活这么紧张，你有时间学习吗？”他想了想，认真地说：“雷锋同志说，学习要有钉子精神，能钻，能挤，就会有时间。”有个时期，晚上经常停电，麦贤得就用玻璃瓶做了个小油灯，一停电他就点起来。在昏黄的灯影里读着毛主席的书，他觉得心头象充满阳光一样温暖，一样明亮。
    麦贤得读毛主席的书，最能联系实际。他学了就用，学一点、用一点。（编者插话：这学一点用一点非常重要。麦贤得、雷锋、王杰，都有这个特点，很值得我们学习。他们学习毛主席著作的最可贵之处，就在于能够联系实际——联系自己的思想、工作、生活，读一遍、想一遍，学一点、用一点，很实在。学习中只有有了这种实在精神，才能成为一个坚强的革命战士。）他自己刚入伍时有些想家，读了《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》就对照检查自己，很快安下心来。班里有个新战士，刚入伍也是有些想家，情绪常波动。麦贤得想：毛主席说过，我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。我应该多帮助战友才对呀！麦贤得首先从生活上热情照顾这位同志，给他洗脏衣服，一连洗了几次。两人变得很亲近了，麦贤得便和他一起学习《纪念白求恩》，一边读书，一边谈感想，越拉越热呼，那位新战士激动地说：“白求恩是个外国人，为了中国人民的革命事业，那样全心全意地工作，我要是不好好干，就对不起党，对不起祖国！”麦贤得高兴地紧握着他的手：“对，我们来革命，就是要和一切反动派斗争到底！”
