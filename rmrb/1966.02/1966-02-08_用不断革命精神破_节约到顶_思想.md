    Use the Spirit of Continuous Revolution to Break the "Maximum Savings" Thought
    Shanghai Alcohol Factory's coal consumption has been decreasing steadily, from "one and a half tons of coal per ton of alcohol" to "one ton of coal per ton of alcohol," to approaching "half a ton of coal per ton of alcohol."

    (Our dispatch) The Shanghai Alcohol Factory, a national advanced unit in saving coal, has, after eight years of effort, reduced the average coal consumption per ton of alcohol produced last year from 1,590 kilograms in the past to over 590 kilograms. According to the currently available foreign technical data, this coal consumption is even lower than that of countries with highly developed alcohol industries and very low coal consumption. The yearly decrease in coal consumption has created conditions for production development, and alcohol production has increased by two times compared to the past.

    The Shanghai Alcohol Factory has always regarded saving coal as a major issue in implementing the policy of building the country through diligence and frugality. They focused on saving when coal supply was relatively difficult, and they also focused on saving when coal supply was relatively abundant; they focused on saving when coal consumption per unit product was high, and they also focused on saving when coal consumption was already very low; they focused on saving when they had not yet been rated as an advanced unit, and they continued to focus on saving after being rated as a national pacesetter in saving.

    When they first started saving coal, many workers thought that coal only accounted for 10 percent of the total cost of alcohol production, a small proportion. Even if they put a lot of effort into saving a few kilograms of coal, it would not reduce costs much, and it was not worthwhile. It would be better to find ways to increase alcohol production; once production increased, costs would be greatly reduced, and even if more coal was used, it would still be worthwhile.

    The Party branch of the Shanghai Alcohol Factory realized from the workers' lively thoughts that saving coal was not simply a technical problem, but first and foremost a matter of ideological and political work. Therefore, they organized workers to discuss the political significance of saving coal. The workers realized that as socialist construction increasingly develops, the country's need for alcohol is constantly increasing. However, Shanghai's industrial coal consumption largely relies on transportation from other places, and the state cannot completely increase coal supply in proportion to the increase in alcohol production; even if it did, the factory's boilers and coal yards would not be sufficient. Therefore, if only production is emphasized without making efforts to save coal, even if more alcohol is desired, it cannot be produced. This does not conform to the spirit of the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Based on this understanding, everyone thought of ways from all aspects, wrapping up some "bare" pipes and removing redundant pipes, reducing the loss of steam and water. Coal consumption in 1958 decreased by 21 percent compared to 1957, saving more than 1,200 tons of coal, and alcohol production also increased by 50 percent.

    Because coal consumption decreased year after year, by 1962, some people believed that "potential has been exhausted, savings have reached the limit." The factory leadership then led the workers to compare the factory's production situation with advanced foreign levels, so that everyone saw that some countries used less than one ton of coal per ton of alcohol, while the factory at that time still needed to use more than one ton. The comparison greatly broadened the workers' horizons and increased their political enthusiasm to catch up with advanced foreign levels and win honor for the country. Many people felt that some tangible waste had been reduced in the past few years, but a lot of intangible waste still existed in large quantities. Therefore, the slogan "one ton of alcohol, one ton of coal" became the goal of struggle for all the workers again. By the end of that year, coal consumption per ton of alcohol was reduced to more than 940 kilograms.

    At the beginning of 1965, the factory leadership further proposed the goal of catching up with and surpassing international advanced levels in coal consumption, greatly stimulating the revolutionary enthusiasm of all the workers and sweeping away the new "savings have reached the limit" thought among some workers. Some old workers said, "We must catch up to the front and win glory for the motherland! Why can't we make foreign countries catch up with us in coal consumption?" The workers further reformed the production process, finally reducing the coal consumption per ton of alcohol by nearly 20 percent again.

    As a result of continuous ideological education, saving coal has taken deep root in the minds of the workers. The workers in the boiler room even tried to tightly block the tiny seams next to the grate to prevent even a little coal dust from leaking out. This revolutionary spirit of the workers in cherishing coal for the country is generating increasingly greater material power. The same ton of coal, in today's Shanghai Alcohol Factory, can already be used as much as two and a half tons used to be.

    The factory's coal saving is carried out in conjunction with the requirements of saving electricity and saving grain. In order to save these materials, the workers carry out technical innovations and improve processes every year. Especially in the recent three or four years, as the work of saving coal and other tasks has continued to deepen, new processes and technologies have continued to emerge. The boiler room, which is responsible for supplying steam to the entire factory, used three boilers in the past few years and still could not meet the needs of production; now, production has increased, but because steam is used very sparingly, only one boiler is used to meet the needs of the entire factory, saving coal, equipment, and also saving a lot of manpower.

    Currently, this factory is further emphasizing politics, continuing to carry out technical innovations, and striving to reach the level of "half a ton of coal per ton of alcohol" in a relatively short period of time, saving even more coal.

### 用不断革命精神破“节约到顶”思想

    用不断革命精神破“节约到顶”思想
    上海酒精厂耗煤节节下降，从“一吨酒精吨半煤”，到“一吨酒精一吨煤”，到接近“一吨酒精半吨煤”。
    本报讯　全国节约煤炭先进单位——上海酒精厂，经过八年的努力，去年每生产一吨酒精所用的煤，平均从过去的一千五百九十公斤，降低到五百九十多公斤。据目前掌握的国外技术资料来看，这个煤耗量，比世界上酒精工业十分发达、煤炭消耗很低的国家还要低。煤耗逐年降低，给生产发展创造了条件，酒精产量比过去增长了两倍。
    上海酒精厂一直把节约煤炭看作是贯彻执行勤俭建国方针的重大问题。他们在煤炭供应比较困难的时候抓节约，在煤炭供应比较充裕的时候也抓节约；在单位产品煤耗高的时候抓节约，在煤耗已经很低的时候也抓节约；在未被评为先进单位的时候抓节约，在被评为全国节约标兵以后继续抓节约。
    刚开展节约煤炭的时候，不少职工认为：煤炭在酒精生产的整个成本中，只占百分之十，比重很小，即算花很大力气节约几斤煤，也降低不了多少成本，油水不大；还不如想办法提高酒精的产量，产量上去了，成本就会大大降低，即使多用些煤，还是合算的。
    上海酒精厂党支部从职工群众反映的活思想中体会到，节约煤炭，不是单纯抓技术的问题，而是首先要抓政治思想工作。于是组织职工讨论节约煤炭的政治意义。职工们认识到：随着社会主义建设的日益发展，国家对酒精的需要量不断增加，但是，上海工业生产用煤要大量从外地运来，国家不可能完全按酒精产量增长比例增加煤炭供应；即使供应了，厂里的锅炉、煤场也不够用。所以，如果只抓产量，不努力节约煤炭，就是想多生产酒精，也多不起来。这是不符合多快好省的总路线的精神的。根据这个认识，大家从各个方面想办法，把一些“赤膊”的管道包扎起来，把多余的管道拆掉，减少了汽和水的损耗。一九五八年的煤耗就比一九五七年降低了百分之二十一，节省了一千二百多吨煤炭，酒精产量也增长了五成。
    由于煤耗连年降低，到一九六二年，有人认为：“潜力挖尽、节约到顶”了。工厂领导方面又领导职工把本厂的生产情况同国外的先进水平对比，使大家看到有些国家每吨酒精用煤还不到一吨，而当时厂里仍要用一吨以上。对比，大大打开了职工们的眼界，提高了职工们赶上国外先进水平、为国家争气的政治热情。很多人觉得过去几年一些有形的浪费减少了，但是很多无形的浪费还大量存在。于是，“一吨酒精一吨煤”的口号，又成为全厂职工奋斗的目标。到这一年底，每吨酒精的煤耗降低到九百四十多公斤。
    一九六五年年初，工厂领导方面进一步提出了要在煤耗上迎头赶上和超过国际先进水平的目标，大大地激发了全厂职工的革命热情，扫掉了一部分职工中新的“节约到顶”思想。有的老工人说：“我们一定要赶到头里去，为祖国争光！为什么不能在煤耗上叫国外来赶赶我们？”职工们进一步改革了生产工艺，终于使每吨酒精的耗煤量又降低了近两成。
    不断进行思想教育的结果，节约煤炭已在职工的思想上扎下很深的根子。炉子间的工人连炉排旁边的细缝，也设法严严堵住，不让一点煤屑漏出来。职工们这种为国家爱惜煤炭的革命精神，正在产生越来越大的物质力量。同样一吨煤，在今天的上海酒精厂，已经能顶过去两吨半的用场。
    这个厂的节煤是结合着节电、节粮的要求一起开展起来的。职工们为了节约这些物资，年年都搞技术革新，改进工艺。尤其是最近三四年间，随着节约用煤等工作不断深入，新工艺、新技术不断涌现。负责供应全厂蒸汽的炉子间，前几年用三台锅炉，还满足不了生产的需要；现在，产量上去了，可是因为蒸汽用得很省，只用了一台锅炉，就满足了全厂需要，省了煤炭、设备，还节省了许多人力。
    目前，这个工厂正在进一步突出政治，继续开展技术革新，争取在较短的时间内达到“一吨酒精半吨煤”的水平，节省更多的煤炭。
