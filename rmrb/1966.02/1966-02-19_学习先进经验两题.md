    Two Topics on Learning Advanced Experience
    Lathe Operator Jiang Qi'en
    Believing and Not Believing
    Generally speaking, whenever we hear about or come into contact with an advanced experience, the question of believing or not believing often arises in our minds. For example, when we see someone's demonstration, we think: "This is just for show; it probably won't work when processing a large number of parts!" "You're using a good lathe; it might not work on my old, broken-down one!" "Your tool is good, but if I don't learn it well, it might not be as good as my old tool!" and so on.

    Why does the problem of disbelief arise? Generally speaking, it is because our thinking lags behind reality. Objective things are developing forward, but people's thinking hasn't kept up. Old workers in factories have a certain amount of production experience from working with machines for many years. Having experience is a good thing, but under certain conditions, it can also turn into conservatism. Sometimes, we feel that our own set of methods is handy and we believe in ourselves more than others. Or, influenced by a kind of habitual force, we don't feel so sensitive to some new things and don't accept them so quickly.

    The burnishing tool for lathe operators has been used by others for a long time, but I had long been distrustful of it. In 1958, I wanted to try making such a tool, but I failed. In 1963, I heard people say that burnishing tools were good and that the surface finish of workpieces processed with them could reach grade 8 or higher. I made a second one, but it still didn't work. I thought, "Don't mess around. It's good enough for a lathe operator to process parts to grade 6. After polishing with sandpaper and files, reaching grade 7 is the limit."

    In 1965, I participated in the National Experience Exchange Conference on Advanced Cutting Tools, which was a real eye-opener. An old worker from the Tangshan Chemical Machinery Factory used a burnishing tool to process parts with a surface finish of grade 10, so shiny that it could reflect a person's image. Seeing is believing. After returning from Beijing, my doubts were somewhat dispelled, so I made two more in the same way. After testing, the surface finish really reached grade 10. I calmly analyzed the technical reasons for my past failures and summed up the lessons I should learn in terms of ideology. I felt that we cannot be subjective about technical issues. Before thorough and repeated practice, we cannot easily affirm this or negate that based on our own limited experience. I realized that disbelief can be transformed into belief under certain conditions. The conditions for transformation are not subjective imagination and hearsay, but practice, thorough and repeated practice.
        Learning and Creating
    Any experience is created in a specific environment and is often subject to certain conditions. If we don't start from our own actual situation and don't digest it to our own liking, we may swallow it whole and suffer from indigestion. Therefore, learning from others' experience must be combined with individual effort and creativity. Creating without learning makes the foundation of creation unstable; learning without creating makes the learned experience inflexible. In my opinion, the word "learn" is important, but the word "create" is even more important.

    In 1965, our group accepted the task of processing 30,000 support shafts. At first, each person processed more than 60 pieces per day and thought that was the limit. Later, we heard that the Shanghai Xin Jian Machinery Factory could do more than 230 pieces per day, almost three times more than us. Their main experience was to use template tools on semi-automatic lathes. Some people here said:
  “No wonder their efficiency is high; it turns out they are using semi-automatic lathes.” “If we had such good lathes, we could also produce 230 pieces.” Some comrades also believed that different material and technical conditions were not a fundamental problem. We could learn from their spirit, create our own conditions, learn from their strengths, and overcome our weaknesses. After our research, we acted according to the latter opinion, which increased processing efficiency to 250 pieces, basically meeting our requirements for learning from the Shanghai Xin Jian Machinery Factory's experience.

    Even if we have completely mastered the advanced experience of others, we cannot regard it as the end of learning experience, but should regard it as just the beginning, because there is still a process of application and creation that needs to be completed by us. Those who think that everything is fine after learning a little are always going to follow behind others.

    学习先进经验两题
    车工  姜奇恩
    相信与不相信
    一般说来，每当我们听说或者接触一项先进经验的时候，往往在脑子里会出现个相信和不相信的问题。譬如看到人家表演，就想：“这是表演给别人看的，加工大量的活，不见得行？”“你用的是好床子，搬到我这破旧床子上就不一定灵！”“你的刀固然好，学不好，说不定还不如我的老刀哩！”等等。
    为什么会出现不相信的问题呢？总的来说，还是因为思想落后于实际。客观事物向前发展了，人的思想没跟上趟。工厂的老工人，摆弄机器多少年，都有一定的生产经验。有了经验是好事，但是有经验在一定条件下也可以转化为保守。有时候，总觉得自己那一套得心应手，相信自己的，不大相信别人的。或者受了一种习惯势力的影响，对一些新鲜事物感觉得不那么灵敏，接受得不那么快。
    车工的滚压光工具，早就有人应用了，但是我却长期对它信不着。一九五八年，我就想试做这种工具，结果失败了。一九六三年，又听人家说滚压工具好，用它加工出的工件光洁度可以达到八级以上。我又做了第二把，还是不行。我想，别胡闹了，车工能加工出两花六级的活就不错了，加上砂布和锉刀打磨一下，达到三花七级光洁度算顶天了。
    一九六五年，我参加了全国先进刀具工具经验交流会，真是大开眼界。唐山化工机械厂一位老工人，用滚压工具加工出来的活，光洁度达到四花十级，能照出人影来。耳听不如眼见。从北京回来，我的疑虑有些打消，就照样做了两把，一试验，光洁度果然达到了四花十级。我冷静地分析出了自己过去在技术上失败的原因，又从思想上总结了应该吸取的教训。我觉得，对于技术问题来不得半点主观，在没有经过认真地反复地实践以前，不能凭自己的点滴经验，就轻易地肯定这个和否定那个。我认识到，不相信可以在一定条件下转化为相信。转化的条件不是主观想象和道听途说，而是实践，是认真地反复地实践。
        学和创
    任何一项经验，都是在特定的环境下创造的，往往受一定条件的限制。如果不从自己的实际情况出发，不用自己的胃口来消化，就可能囫囵吞枣，消化不良。因此学习别人的经验，一定要同个人的努力和创造相结合。只创不学，创的根基不牢；只学不创，学的经验不活。依我看，“学”字重要，“创”字更重要。
    一九六五年我们小组接受了加工三万个支撑轴的任务。一开始每人每天加工到六十多个，就认为到顶了。以后，听说上海新建机械厂每天能干到二百三十多个，超过我们近三倍。他们的主要经验是，在半自动车床上采用样板刀加工。我们这里有的人说：
  “怪不得效率高，原来是用半自动车床。”“如果我们有那样的好床子，也能干出二百三。”也有部分同志认为，物质技术条件不一样不是个根本问题，我们可以学人家的精神，创造自己的条件，学人家的长处，克服自己的短处。经过我们研究，按照后一种意见干了，使加工效率提高到二百五十个，基本达到了我们学习上海新建机械厂经验的要求。
    别人的先进经验，即便是我们完全学到了手，也不能看做是学习经验的结束，而应该认为仅仅是开始，因为还有一段运用和创造的过程需要我们来完成。那种学了一点东西，就认为万事大吉的人，总是要跟在别人的屁股后面转的。
