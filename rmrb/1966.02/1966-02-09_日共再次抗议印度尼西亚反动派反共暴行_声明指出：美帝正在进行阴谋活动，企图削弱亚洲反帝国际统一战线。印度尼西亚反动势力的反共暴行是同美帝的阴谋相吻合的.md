    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th -- The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on January 30th, once again protesting the mass killings and suppression of Indonesian communists and democratic forces.

    The statement pointed out: The Japanese Communist Party is deeply concerned about the expanding suppression and mass killings of the Indonesian Communist Party and democratic forces in Indonesia under the pretext of the so-called "September 30th Incident"; we cannot but express a serious attitude.

    The statement said, "Our Party has already lodged a serious protest against the shocking atrocities committed by Indonesian reactionary forces against the Indonesian Communist Party and democratic groups in General Secretary Miyamoto's speech delivered at the seventh *Akahata* Festival on October 17th last year, and in the *Akahata* editorial on October 23rd.
    "Regrettably, the direction of developments in Indonesia since then has been increasingly and seriously contrary to the interests of national liberation and world peace, and to the interests of the Indonesian revolution." The statement said that Indonesian reactionary forces have expanded their extremely illegal and brutal suppression in the Jakarta area to the entire Indonesia, and everywhere they are carrying out various terrorist activities such as attacks, arrests, torture, and massacres against communists and progressive forces. Progressive newspapers and other publications have been banned. This is clearly a violation of the most basic principles of human rights and is absolutely not permissible in a country governed by the rule of law.

    The statement said, "Recently, American imperialism is intensifying increasingly brutal and insidious conspiracies of division, sabotage, and deception against the rising struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

    "American imperialism is carrying out various conspiracies in an attempt to weaken the Asian anti-imperialist international united front, which has become the focal point of imperialist contradictions. In this situation, it is only natural that the brutal anti-communist actions taken by Indonesian reactionary forces using the 'September 30th Incident' coincide with the conspiracy of American imperialism to weaken the Asian anti-imperialist and peace front." The statement concluded, "The consistent position of the Japanese Communist Party is to advocate the development of an international united front against imperialism headed by the United States, for national liberation and peace, to strengthen the solidarity between the Japanese and Indonesian peoples, and to oppose the common enemy. From this standpoint, we once again protest the mass killings and suppression of Indonesian communists and democratic forces."

    日共再次抗议印度尼西亚反动派反共暴行
    声明指出：美帝正在进行阴谋活动，企图削弱亚洲反帝国际统一战线。印度尼西亚反动势力的反共暴行是同美帝的阴谋相吻合的
    新华社八日讯　东京消息：日本共产党一月三十日发表一项声明，再一次抗议对印度尼西亚共产党员和民主力量进行的大批屠杀和镇压。
    声明指出：日本共产党对于借口所谓“九月三十日事件”而在印度尼西亚扩大着的镇压和大批屠杀印度尼西亚共产党和民主力量的情况深为忧虑；我们不能不表示严肃的态度。
    声明说，“我们党对于印度尼西亚反动势力对印度尼西亚共产党和民主团体施加的令人震惊的暴行，已经在去年十月十七日第七次《赤旗报》节发表的宫本总书记的讲话中和《赤旗报》十月二十三日的社论中，提出了严重抗议。
    “遗憾的是，从那以后印度尼西亚局势的发展方向，无论是对于民族解放与世界和平的利益，或者是对于印度尼西亚革命的利益，都是越来越严重地背道而驰。”声明说，印度尼西亚反动势力已经把他们在雅加达地区进行的极端非法而残暴的镇压扩大到整个印度尼西亚，到处都在对共产党和进步力量进行袭击、逮捕、拷问、惨杀等种种恐怖行动。进步报刊和其它刊物都遭到禁止。这显然是违反基本人权的起码原则的行为，也是一个法治国家所绝对不能容许的事情。
    声明说，“最近，美国帝国主义对于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民日益高涨的斗争，正在加紧进行着越来越残暴而且阴险的分裂、破坏和欺骗的阴谋活动。
    “美国帝国主义正在进行种种阴谋活动，企图削弱已成为帝国主义矛盾焦点的亚洲的反帝国际统一战线。在这种情况下，印度尼西亚反动势力利用‘九月三十日事件’而采取的残暴的反共行动，同美国帝国主义妄图削弱亚洲反帝和平战线的阴谋相吻合是很自然的事情。”声明最后说，“日本共产党的一贯立场是，主张发展反对以美国为首的帝国主义、争取民族解放与和平的国际统一战线，加强日本人民和印度尼西亚人民的团结，反对共同敌人。从这个立场出发，我们再一次抗议对印度尼西亚共产党员和民主力量进行的大批屠杀和镇压。”
