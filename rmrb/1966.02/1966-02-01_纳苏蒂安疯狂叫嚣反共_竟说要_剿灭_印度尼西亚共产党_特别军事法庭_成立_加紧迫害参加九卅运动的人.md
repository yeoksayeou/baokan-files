　　Nasution Frantically Clamors for Anti-Communism
    Even Saying He Wants to "Exterminate" the Indonesian Communist Party
   "Special Military Tribunal" Established, Stepping Up the Persecution of Those Who Participated in the September 30th Movement
    Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from Jakarta: Indonesian Minister Coordinator for Defense and Security Affairs, Nasution, clamored that the so-called "extermination operation" against the Indonesian Communist Party should be "carried through to the end."
    According to Antara News Agency reports, Nasution, in a speech at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Islamic Teachers' Association in Jakarta on the 28th, slandered the Indonesian Communist Party as "a party that planned and carried out counter-revolution," and clamored that "it is already very clear and definite that the Indonesian Communist Party should be dissolved according to the form and content of Presidential Decree No. 7, especially the provisions regarding the dissolution of organizations."
    Nasution said, "The dissolution of the Indonesian Communist Party is already a fact, both practically and legally, in various regions." However, "it is still necessary" to "carry through to the end" the so-called "extermination operation" against the Indonesian Communist Party.
    In his speech, Nasution also revealed that the so-called "interrogation work" of some leaders of the Indonesian Communist Party has ended.
    According to Antara News Agency reports on the 29th, Indonesian Army Commander Suharto presided over the inauguration ceremony of the "Special Military Tribunal" at the Army Headquarters that morning. This tribunal was decided to be established at the first meeting of the reorganized Indonesian Supreme Operations Command on December 1st last year, in order to "interrogate" those who participated in the September 30th Movement.
    Suharto revealed that this "Special Military Tribunal" will open no later than mid-February.

  　纳苏蒂安疯狂叫嚣反共
    竟说要“剿灭”印度尼西亚共产党
   “特别军事法庭”成立　加紧迫害参加九卅运动的人
    新华社三十一日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚国防和安全部组统筹部长纳苏蒂安叫嚣要把对印度尼西亚共产党的所谓“剿灭行动”“进行到底”。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，纳苏蒂安二十八日在雅加达举行的伊斯兰教师联合会成立四十周年庆祝仪式上的讲话中，诬蔑印度尼西亚共产党“是策划和实行反革命的党”，叫嚷“应该根据第七号总统决定的形式和内容，特别是关于解散组织的规定，来解散印度尼西亚共产党，已经是十分清楚而又明确的事了。”
    纳苏蒂安说，“印度尼西亚共产党的解散在各个地区实际上和法律上都已经是事实”。但是，“还有必要”把对印度尼西亚共产党的所谓“剿灭行动”“进行到底”。
    纳苏蒂安在讲话中还透露，迫害印度尼西亚共产党一些领导人的所谓“侦讯工作”已经结束。
    据安塔拉通讯社二十九日报道，印度尼西亚陆军司令苏哈托当天上午在陆军司令部主持了“特别军事法庭”成立典礼。这个法庭是改组后的印度尼西亚最高行动指挥部在去年十二月一日的第一次会议上决定要成立的，以便来“审讯”参加九月三十日运动的人。
    苏哈托透露，这个“特别军事法庭”最迟将在二月中旬开庭。
