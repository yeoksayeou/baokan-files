    Editor's Note: The National Symposium on Dry-Sown Grain Crops proposed to remove the labels of "coarse grains" from dry grains. This is a good point, and it's timely. This is not just a matter of nomenclature, but a matter of correcting the idea of underestimating dry grain crops, and putting dry grain production in a position as important as rice and wheat production.
    Dry grains, formerly conventionally called "miscellaneous grains" or "coarse grains," include corn, millet, sorghum, beans, potatoes, and the like. In the old society, the exploiting classes called these grains "miscellaneous grains" or "coarse grains," and only referred to rice and white flour as "staple foods" or "refined grains," because they only ate rice and white flour themselves. This prejudice of the exploiting classes still influences some of our cadres, who only pay attention to the production of rice and wheat, and do not pay attention to the production of so-called "miscellaneous grains" or "coarse grains." This is an important reason why the development of dry grain production in our country has been relatively slow since liberation. Therefore, in order to change the face of dry grain production and make it develop faster and greater, it is necessary to remove the labels of "miscellaneous grains" and "coarse grains" from dry grains, and raise the position of dry grain production in the entire grain production.
    The sown area of dry grain crops ranks first among the sown areas of grain crops in my country. It is more than twice the area of rice cultivation and nearly twice the area of wheat cultivation. The vast people in northern China and the hilly areas of southern China mainly eat dry grains; and the stalks of dry grain crops such as millet, sorghum, and corn are important raw materials for building houses, feeding livestock, burning firewood, and weaving utensils in rural areas. Therefore, grasping dry grain production is of great significance for the comprehensive development of agricultural production, further improving people's lives, and increasing grain reserves.
    The view that dry grain crops are "easy crops" or "low-yield crops" is also incorrect. Dry grain crops are generally adaptable, tolerant to waterlogging and drought, and conducive to disaster resistance and yield protection. The potential for increasing dry grain production is great. As long as we carry forward the Dazhai spirit, do a good job in farmland capital construction in accordance with local conditions, make full use of the high-yield experience of dry grains created by the masses, and implement intensive cultivation, dry grain crops will become high-yield crops and will greatly increase production, which has been proven by a large number of facts. Comrades in various places who lead agricultural production should seriously treat the issue of developing dry grain production, strengthen leadership, and strive to increase dry grain production.
    Grasp Dry Grain Production Like Wheat and Rice Production
    Remove the "Coarse Grain" and "Low Yield" Labels from Dry Grains
    The National Symposium on Dry-Sown Grain Crops believes that accelerating the development of dry grain production is of great significance for completing and overfulfilling the grain production increase tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan and realizing the "National Agricultural Development Program." My country's dry grain production has great potential for increasing production and has great potential.
    Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch  Remove the "miscellaneous grain" and "coarse grain" labels and the "low-yield" label from dry grains, grasp dry grain production like wheat and rice production, vigorously improve the level of dry grain production, and comprehensively develop grain production. This is an issue of great significance raised by the National Symposium on Dry-Sown Grain Crops.
    Dry-sown grain crops include corn, millet, sorghum, beans, potatoes, etc. (referred to as dry grains). These crops are the most widely planted and have the largest sown area in my country. According to statistics, the sown area of dry grain crops in the fourteen major dry grain producing provinces and regions in the north and the vast hilly areas in the south is generally more than twice the area of rice cultivation and nearly twice the area of wheat cultivation in the country.
    Representatives from the major dry grain producing areas of twenty-six provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions studied the situation of dry grain production and exchanged experiences at the symposium held by the Ministry of Agriculture. The symposium believes that in recent years, the national dry grain production situation has been getting better year by year. Although many areas in the north suffered from drought in 1965, the yield of dry grains in most areas still increased. However, the increase in dry grain production has not been commensurate with the proportion of its sown area in all grain crops over the years. Therefore, dry grain production is a weak link in the current overall grain production. The representatives unanimously believe that raising the status of dry grains, strengthening leadership over dry grain production, and accelerating the development of dry grain production are of great significance for completing and overfulfilling the grain production increase tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan and realizing the "National Agricultural Development Program."
    The symposium emphasized that grasping dry grain production is of great significance for resisting drought and waterlogging, striving for grain harvests, and improving people's lives. Many dry grain crops, such as sorghum and millet, are widely adaptable and have strong disaster resistance capabilities, with the characteristics of drought and waterlogging resistance. As long as these crops are well managed, they can still achieve stable and high yields in the event of drought and flood disasters. Dry grains are not only the staple food of the vast masses in northern China and the hilly areas of southern China, but also its by-products are the main raw materials for building houses, feeding livestock, burning firewood, grinding tofu, making vermicelli, making cakes, making furniture, extracting oil, and brewing wine in rural areas, which are related to all aspects of people's lives, and also to the development of animal husbandry and diversified operations.
    The symposium believes that in order to substantially increase the yield of dry grain crops, it is necessary to correct the idea of underestimating dry grain crops. Do not use the old society's habit of calling dry grains "miscellaneous grains" and "coarse grains." It is necessary to remove these inappropriate labels from dry grains and give it the same importance as rice and wheat. The symposium suggested that all localities should have a comprehensive perspective in leading grain production, grasp dry grain production like rice and wheat production, strengthen farmland capital construction for dry-sown crops, implement intensive cultivation, increase fertilizer application, and rapidly improve the production level of dry grains.
    A large number of facts provided by the symposium show that my country's dry grain has great potential for increasing production and has great potential. Dry grain crops such as sorghum, millet, and soybeans are not "easy crops" or "low-yield crops" as some people think. In 1965, whether in the south or the north, whether in high-yield areas or low-yield areas, a batch of high-yield dry grain units emerged. Dazhai Brigade of Dazhai Commune in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, is a prominent unit with high yields of dry grain crops. Last year, although it suffered an unprecedented severe drought and a rainstorm attack, the average grain yield per mu still reached 796 jin. Zunhua County in Hebei Province and Chongming County in Shanghai City achieved an average corn yield of 600 jin per mu; in other areas, some communes and teams achieved a yield of 1,400 to 1,500 jin per mu. Miyun County in Beijing City achieved an average millet yield of 450 jin per mu; in other areas, some communes and teams achieved a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. Tongliao County in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has more than 33,000 mu of sorghum with an average yield of 400 jin per mu; in other areas, some communes and teams achieved a yield of 700 to 800 jin per mu, and some even reached more than 1,000 jin per mu. In some communes and teams in Northeast China, the average soybean yield per mu reached 300 to 400 jin. High-yield records of 4,000 to 5,000 jin of potatoes per mu have appeared in Yunnan, Qinghai, Heilongjiang, and Hubei provinces.
    Representatives from various places seriously studied various measures to develop dry grain production. They pointed out that the key to improving dry grain production at present is to carry forward the Dazhai spirit, do a good job in farmland capital construction with soil as the main focus, and combine soil, fertilizer, and water. Dry grain crops are mostly planted on thin, poor, high, low-lying, sandy, and alkaline land. These low-yield lands must be comprehensively managed with soil, water, mountains, and forests. All localities should create a "Dazhai-style farmland" that is suitable for the growth of dry grain crops, can retain water and fertilizer, and has a deep, flat, and aggregated soil structure in accordance with local conditions. Dry grain production in the north is also often threatened by drought, and there are also some waterlogged areas that are often subject to waterlogging. Therefore, all localities must fight hard on the "water" issue. It is necessary to build water conservancy projects to solve the problems of irrigation and flood control. At the same time, work hard on the "fertilizer" issue and increase fertilizer application according to the needs of the crops.
    Production practices in various places have proven that improving varieties is the most economical and effective way to increase dry grain yield. The symposium requested that seed departments and agricultural scientific research departments in various places should closely integrate with the masses, vigorously cultivate, propagate, and promote improved varieties of dry grains.
    The symposium pointed out that intensive cultivation is also a key issue in increasing dry grain production. Compared with crops such as rice and cotton, the cultivation of dry grain crops is now mostly extensive. According to the experience of high-yield dry grain models in various places, dry grain fields need to be deeply ploughed and finely harrowed, sown in a timely manner, reasonably densely planted, and managed carefully to ensure that the seedlings are full and complete. At the same time, special attention should be paid to the prevention and control of pests.
    The symposium emphasized that the key to promoting the rapid and comprehensive increase in the production of dry grain crops lies in leading cadres and the broad masses holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlighting politics, carrying forward the Dazhai spirit, taking the Dazhai road, setting up models, and further carrying out a solid and vigorous movement of comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing.

### 象抓小麦水稻生产一样来抓旱粮生产  给旱粮摘掉“杂粮”帽子和“低产”帽子

专栏：

    编者按：全国旱播粮食作物座谈会提出要给旱粮摘掉“杂粮”“粗粮”的帽子。这个问题提得好，提得是时候。这绝不仅仅是个名称的问题，而是纠正轻视旱粮作物的思想，把旱粮生产摆在和水稻、小麦生产同等重要地位的问题。
    旱粮，即过去习惯所称的“杂粮”、“粗粮”，包括玉米、谷子、高粱、豆类、薯类等。在旧社会，剥削阶级把这些粮食叫作“杂粮”“粗粮”，只称大米、白面为“主粮”“细粮”，因为他们自己是只吃大米、白面的。剥削阶级的这种偏见，至今还影响着我们的一些干部，他们只重视水稻和小麦生产，不重视所谓“杂粮”“粗粮”的生产。这是解放以来我国旱粮生产发展比较缓慢的一个重要原因。因此，要改变旱粮生产的面貌，使之有更快更大的发展，就必须给旱粮摘掉“杂粮”、“粗粮”的帽子，提高旱粮生产在整个粮食生产上的地位。
    旱粮作物的播种面积，占我国粮食作物播种面积的第一位。比水稻种植面积大一倍多，比小麦种植面积大近两倍。我国北方和南方丘陵山区的广大人民以旱粮为主食；而谷子、高粱、玉米等旱粮作物的秸秆，又是农村中修房子、喂牲口、烧柴火、编用具等的重要原料和材料。因此，抓好旱粮生产，对于全面发展农业生产，进一步改善人民生活，增加粮食储备，有重大的意义。
    旱粮作物是“懒庄稼”、“低产作物”，这种看法也是不正确的。旱粮作物一般适应性强，耐涝抗旱，有利于抗灾保收。旱粮的增产潜力很大。只要发扬大寨精神，因地制宜地搞好农田基本建设，充分运用群众所创造的旱粮高产经验，实行精耕细作，旱粮作物就会成为高产作物，就会大幅度地增产，这已经是大量事实所证明了的。各地领导农业生产的同志，要认真对待发展旱粮生产问题，加强领导，争取旱粮增产。
    象抓小麦水稻生产一样来抓旱粮生产
    给旱粮摘掉“杂粮”帽子和“低产”帽子
    全国旱播粮食作物座谈会认为：加速发展旱粮生产，对完成和超额完成第三个五年计划的粮食增产任务，实现“全国农业发展纲要”，具有重大意义。我国旱粮增产潜力很大，大有可为。
    新华社五日讯　摘掉旱粮的“杂粮”、“粗粮”帽子和“低产”帽子，象抓小麦、水稻生产一样来抓旱粮生产，大力提高旱粮生产水平，全面发展粮食生产。这是全国旱播粮食作物座谈会提出的一个具有重大意义的问题。
    旱播粮食作物包括玉米、谷子、高粱、豆类、薯类等（简称旱粮）。这些作物是我国种植地区最广、播种面积最大的粮食作物。据统计，北方十四个主要生产旱粮的省、区和南方广大丘陵山区每年旱粮作物的播种面积，一般比全国水稻种植面积大一倍多，比小麦种植面积大将近两倍。
    来自二十六个省、市、自治区的旱粮重点产区的代表，在农业部召开的座谈会上研究了旱粮生产的情况，交流了经验。座谈会认为，近几年来，全国旱粮生产形势一年比一年好，一九六五年虽然北方相当多的地区遭受干旱，但大多数地区的旱粮产量仍有增加。但是，旱粮的增产幅度，历年来同其播种面积在全部粮食作物中所占的比重不相符。因此，旱粮生产是当前整个粮食生产中的一个薄弱环节。代表们一致认为，提高旱粮的地位，加强对旱粮生产的领导，加速发展旱粮生产，对于完成和超额完成第三个五年计划的粮食增产任务，实现“全国农业发展纲要”，具有重大意义。
    座谈会强调指出，抓好旱粮生产，对于抗旱抗涝，争取粮食丰收，改善人民生活，有重大意义。不少旱粮作物，如高粱、谷子等，适应性广，抗灾力强，具有抗旱耐涝的特性，只要抓好了，这些作物遇到旱涝灾害，仍然能够稳产保收，旱粮不仅是北方地区和南方丘陵山区广大群众的主食，它和它的副产物，又是农村中修房子、喂牲畜、烧柴、磨豆腐、做粉条、制糕点、制家具、榨油、酿酒等的主要原料和材料，关系到群众生活的各个方面，也关系到畜牧业和多种经营的发展。
    座谈会认为，要使旱粮作物大幅度增产，就必须纠正轻视旱粮作物的思想，不要沿用旧社会的习惯称旱粮为“杂粮”、“粗粮”，要给旱粮摘掉这些不合适的帽子，象重视水稻、小麦一样的重视旱粮，给予它同等的地位。座谈会建议各地在领导粮食生产中，要有全面观点，要象抓水稻、小麦生产那样抓旱粮生产，加强旱播作物的农田基本建设，实行精耕细作，增施肥料，迅速提高旱粮的生产水平。
    座谈会提供的大量事实说明，我国旱粮的增产潜力很大，大有可为。高粱、谷子、大豆等旱粮作物，并不象有些人认为的那样是“懒庄稼”，“低产作物”。一九六五年，无论在南方或北方，无论在高产区或低产区，都出现一批旱粮高产单位。山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队就是一个种植旱粮作物高产的突出单位，去年虽然遭受空前严重的大旱和一次暴雨的袭击，平均亩产粮食仍然达到七百九十六斤。河北省遵化县和上海市崇明县，全县玉米平均亩产量达到六百斤；其它地区有些社队亩产量达到一千四五百斤。北京市密云县全县谷子平均亩产四百五十斤；其它地区有的社队亩产量达到一千多斤。内蒙古自治区通辽县有三万三千多亩高粱平均亩产四百斤；其它地区有的社队亩产量达到七八百斤，甚至有的达到一千多斤。东北地区有些社队大豆平均亩产量达到三四百斤。云南、青海、黑龙江、湖北等省都出现了亩产四五千斤的马铃薯高产纪录。
    各地来的代表认真研究了发展旱粮生产的各项措施。他们指出，要把旱粮生产搞上去，当前的关键所在，是发扬大寨精神，搞好以土为主，土、肥、水并举的农田基本建设。旱粮作物大多种在瘦、薄、高、洼、砂、碱地上。对这些低产地必须实行土、水、山、林综合治理。各地应因地制宜地为旱粮田创造一个适应旱粮作物生长需要的，能够保水、保肥的，深厚、平整、富有团粒结构的活土层，也就是“大寨式农田”。北方的旱粮生产还常常受干旱威胁，也有一部分涝洼地，常遭水渍。因此，各地必须在“水”字上打硬仗。要兴修水利，解决灌溉和防涝问题。同时在“肥”字上下功夫，根据作物的需要，增施肥料。
    各地生产实践证明，改良品种是提高旱粮产量的最经济、最有效的途径。座谈会要求各地种子部门、农业科学研究部门要同群众密切结合，大力培育、繁殖、推广旱粮良种。
    座谈会指出，精耕细作，也是旱粮增产的一个关键问题。同水稻、棉花等作物相比，现在旱粮作物的耕作大多数是粗放的。根据各地旱粮高产典型的经验，旱粮田需要深耕细耙，适时播种，合理密植，保苗全苗，精细管理。同时要特别注意虫害的防治工作。
    座谈会着重指出，促进旱粮作物的迅速、全面增产，关键在于各级领导干部和广大群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，发扬大寨精神，走大寨之路，办好样板，进一步开展扎扎实实、轰轰烈烈的比学赶帮超运动。
