    The thesis put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" is a fundamental strategic idea for revolutionary people. When we observe U.S. imperialism, we must see both its ferocious side and its weak side. U.S. imperialism most thoroughly exposes its outwardly strong but inwardly weak paper tiger nature in the war of aggression against Vietnam. The Johnson administration's recent decision to resume bombing of North Vietnam is a sign of its determination to expand the war, and also a manifestation of its desperation. The comprehensive report about Washington published here reflects the heavy difficulties, trepidation, and helplessness of the Johnson government, which is at its wits' end in the war of aggression against Vietnam. As long as the Vietnamese people, the peoples of Asian countries, and the people of the world strategically despise it, tactically take it seriously, dare to struggle, and are not afraid of difficulties, they will surely be able to defeat U.S. imperialism. – Editor

    Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Our correspondent reports: As of the 4th, Washington's announcement of the resumption of bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been five days. These five days have not been easy for the White House. Johnson's peace talks hoax has been exposed, his face of expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam has been revealed, and his attempt to submit the issue to the United Nations Security Council for discussion has been very difficult and will certainly not yield any results. This is truly at the end of its rope, and the future is bleak. A crestfallen scene envelops Washington. U.S. imperialism is in greater difficulty, more isolated, and more helpless.

      Robber Language Cannot Hide Inner Panic
    When Johnson read his statement on the resumption of bombing, he used the language of a robber, but he could not hide his grief at the crushing defeat he suffered at the hands of the Vietnamese people. He lamented that the "thirty-seven days" of peace talk conspiracy activities were "fruitless," and now he must continue fighting. He obviously knew that this would offend the public and the future was bleak, so he indicated that the already bankrupt "peace efforts" would "continue." The French newspaper *Le Monde* described Johnson's image when he read this statement on television, saying: "He has never been so gaunt, crestfallen, and gloomy. His tone was like reciting a requiem in a church." This hits the nail on the head, revealing the fearful and uneasy inner world of an aggressor condemned by thousands.
    The guilty American officials were simultaneously ordered to come out and "explain" the official U.S. position. One was Secretary of State Rusk, and the other was UN Representative Goldberg. They rambled on and on, but said nothing more than Johnson. They advocated that the Security Council discuss the Vietnam issue, but even they themselves understood that this was just an outdated trick that had been tried in the past, hit a wall, and would not bring any good results this time either. United Press International said that U.S. officials were "reluctantly taking this action with pessimism and disappointment." *Le Monde* said, "The ultimate major consequence of the failure of the U.S. initiative, which started with such fanfare, is that it seriously undermined President Johnson's prestige in the eyes of international and American public opinion."

    Resumption of Bombing Provokes a Huge Wave of Protests
    Agence France-Presse pointed out that Johnson's resumption of bombing has had a "disastrous impact" in the capitalist world. Indeed, first in Washington and across the United States, a wave of unease and protest emerged.
    The situation in Washington political circles is not as good as before. On August 7, 1964, after the U.S. government fabricated the Gulf of Tonkin incident and launched armed aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, both houses of the U.S. Congress triumphantly passed a joint resolution authorizing the Johnson government to take "all necessary measures, including the use of force," to expand aggression against Southeast Asia. This authorization was a blank check issued to Johnson to arbitrarily expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. Now, after the American aggressors have suffered heavy losses on the Vietnamese battlefield, influential members of the U.S. Congress have issued distinctly different voices. Senator Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, complained in a television speech on the 2nd that the U.S.'s "obligations" in South Vietnam were "self-created." He "regretted" his action of voting for the above resolution in August 1964. He said: "I played a role in it that I am not proud of at all." Another senator, Morse, had previously formally submitted a bill to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee requesting that the aforementioned resolution be "suspended."

    South Vietnam Swamp Will Become a Bottomless Pit
    *The New York Times*, one of the largest mouthpieces of the U.S. monopoly groups, has repeatedly expressed concern about the consequences of the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam. Commenting on the 2nd on Johnson's statement that he would continue to increase troops in South Vietnam, this newspaper pointed out, "As revealed, if another 100,000 or even 500,000 American troops are sent to Vietnam, then certainly more people will go to their deaths. The original swamp will become a bottomless pit." Referring to the resumption of bombing, this newspaper also said that many people in Washington believe that "the military value of last year's bombing was small," and that resuming bombing will not help the United States escape its predicament, because "if the intense bombing from February to December (last year) failed to force the Communists to the conference table, then resuming bombing now can only strengthen their determination to resist."
    Bourgeois newspapers in Western Europe and North America also pointed out that the U.S. resumption of bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam cannot save the U.S. from defeat in South Vietnam, but can only deepen the U.S. government's internal and external difficulties.

    In recent days, governments and officials of many countries have issued statements opposing and condemning the U.S. resumption of bombing. Even the U.S. ally, the French government, issued a statement on the 2nd announcing that "the French government can only express regret and disapproval of the resumption of bombing." The French government also believes that the United Nations "is not qualified to interfere" in the Vietnam issue. A spokesman for the Syrian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 2nd strongly condemning Johnson's decision to resume bombing of North Vietnam and "demanded that the United States stop its aggression."

        European and American People Demonstrate and Denounce Murderers
    The U.S. renewed bombing of North Vietnam has aroused great indignation among the people of all countries, including the American people, and public opinion. New York City residents braved the cold to hold demonstrations and parades, chanting: "End the Vietnam War! Bring the troops back!" The American people are also preparing to march on Washington to express their strong protest against the government's slaughter of the Vietnamese people. In London, England, dozens of angry demonstrators rushed into the House of Commons, which was in session, on the evening of the 1st, shouting slogans protesting against U.S. aggression against Vietnam and the resumption of bombing from the visitor's gallery. In many countries such as France, West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, and Canada, the public also held demonstrations, denouncing Johnson as a murderer.
    The Asian, African, and Latin American Committee for Solidarity with the Vietnamese People Against U.S. Imperialist Aggression issued a statement on the 1st saying that the U.S. resumption of bombing "clearly confirms the hypocrisy of the Johnson government's so-called 'peace offensive,' which is the best proof of the hypocrisy and treachery of the U.S. rulers." The *Cambodia Telegraph* editorial on the 2nd said: "Now, of course, it is impossible to have illusions about restraint on the part of Johnson and his ilk and their advisors. ... It can almost be asserted that this group of adventurers, who have inherited Hitler's mantle, is clearly prepared to gamble everything." The Tanzanian *Nationalist* newspaper published an editorial on the 2nd saying: "If we do not condemn the United States' current actions in North Vietnam, then we have failed to fulfill our duties." The president of the Costa Rican People's Socialist Alliance Party, Ma. Aguiluz, said, "The U.S. bombing of the people of a sovereign (country) thousands of nautical miles from the United States is undoubtedly a blatant act of aggression by the United States."

        Hitting Aerial Robbers in the North, Punishing Spoiled Soldiers in the South
    For the Johnson administration, the more serious problem is that its military aggression has been met with head-on blows from the people of North and South Vietnam. In the North, the well-prepared Vietnamese army and people shot down 18 U.S. bandit planes in four days. In the South, at the same time that Johnson announced the resumption of bombing of North Vietnam, 40,000 U.S. aggressor troops launched five offensives in the 160-kilometer area along Highway 1 along the coast of South Vietnam, but they all collapsed under the heroic blows of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army. The South Vietnamese Liberation Army also severely attacked U.S. aggressor troops and South Korean puppet troops in the coastal areas of Bong Son, Qui Nhon, and Nha Trang in central South Vietnam, as well as near Saigon, on January 31, causing the enemy to suffer huge casualties and losses.
    The seemingly powerful U.S. aggressor robbers have increasingly revealed their paper tiger nature in the face of the heroic Vietnamese army and people. Of course, the enemy will never be reconciled to failure. It will make frantic struggles, further expand the war, and continue to promote the "peace talks" hoax. But no matter how the Johnson administration struggles, the Vietnamese people will drive out the U.S. aggressors without leaving a single one.

### 大规模“和平攻势”惨遭全面失败　恢复轰炸引起国内外一片抗议  一派灰溜溜的景象笼罩着华盛顿  一副纸老虎原形再次暴露于天下

    大规模“和平攻势”惨遭全面失败　恢复轰炸引起国内外一片抗议
    一派灰溜溜的景象笼罩着华盛顿
    一副纸老虎原形再次暴露于天下
    毛泽东同志提出的“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的论断，是革命人民的一个根本战略思想。我们观察美帝国主义，既要看到它凶恶的一面，也要看到它虚弱的一面。美帝国主义在侵越战争中最透彻不过地暴露出它外强中干的纸老虎实质。约翰逊政府最近决定恢复对越南北方的轰炸，这是它决心要扩大战争的标志，同时也是它黔驴技穷的表现。这里发表的一篇关于华盛顿的综合报道，反映出了在侵越战争中走投无路的约翰逊政府是怎样的困难重重，心虚胆怯，手足无措。越南人民、亚洲各国人民和全世界人民只要在战略上藐视它，在战术上重视它，敢于斗争，不怕困难，就一定能够打败美帝国主义。　　　——编者
    新华社五日讯　本社记者报道：到四日为止，华盛顿宣布恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸已经五天了，这五天的日子对白宫来说很不好过。约翰逊的和谈骗局破产了，扩大侵越战争的面目暴露了，提交联合国安全理事会讨论的把戏耍得十分吃力，而且肯定不会有什么结果。这真是黔驴技穷，前途黯淡。一派灰溜溜的景象笼罩着华盛顿。美帝国主义是更困难、更孤立、更手足无措了。
      强盗语言掩不住内心惶恐
    约翰逊在宣读他的恢复轰炸的声明时，使用的是一派强盗的语言，但是，他掩饰不住他在越南人民手里惨遭失败的悲哀。他诉说着“三十七天”的和谈阴谋活动“毫无结果”，现在要打下去。他显然知道，这一来将触犯众怒而且前途渺茫，因此，他又表示那种早已破产了的“和平努力”还要“继续进行”。法国《世界报》描写约翰逊在电视里宣读这篇声明时的形象说：“他从来没有这样的消瘦、灰溜溜和阴郁。他的声调活象是在教堂里念祭文。”这一言道破了一个千夫所指的侵略者的惶恐不安的内心世界。
    作贼心虚的美国要员们同时奉命出来“解释”美国官方的立场。一个是国务卿腊斯克，另一个是驻联合国代表戈德堡。他们洋洋洒洒，唠唠叨叨，但是没有说出比约翰逊更多的东西来。他们鼓吹要安理会讨论越南问题，但是，连他们自己也明白，这不过是一个陈旧不堪的老手法，过去已经尝试过了，碰了壁，这次也不会带来什么好下场。合众国际社说，美国官方是“带着悲观和失望的心情勉强采取这一行动的”。法国《世界报》说，“在开始时弄得喧嚣一时的美国主动行动的失败，最终的主要后果是，严重打击了约翰逊总统在国际舆论和美国舆论面前的声望。”
    恢复轰炸引起了抗议巨浪
    法新社指出，约翰逊恢复轰炸的行动在资本主义世界引起了“灾难性的影响”。的确，首先在华盛顿和全美国，出现了一股不安和抗议的浪潮。
    华盛顿政界的行情大不如前了。一九六四年八月七日，在美国政府制造了北部湾事件并且对越南民主共和国发动武装侵略之后，美国国会两院曾耀武扬威地通过联合决议，授权约翰逊政府采取“包括使用武力在内的一切必要措施”，来扩大对东南亚的侵略。这项授权是签发给约翰逊的任意扩大侵越战争的空白支票。现在，在美国侵略者在越南战场上碰得头破血流之后，美国国会中的有势力的议员发出了截然不同的声调。美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特二日在电视讲话里埋怨美国在南越的“义务”是“自己制造出来的”。他对自己在一九六四年八月投票支持上面的决议这个行动“后悔”了。他说：“我在其中起了我完全不引以自豪的作用”。另一名参议员莫尔斯在这以前已经正式向参院外委会提出议案，要求把上述决议“停止生效”。
    南越沼泽地将变成无底洞
    美国垄断集团最大喉舌之一《纽约时报》曾经一再对美国侵越政策的后果表示忧虑。这家报纸在二日评论约翰逊表示将继续增兵南越时指出，“正如透露的情况一样，如果增派十万甚至五十万美国军队到越南去的话，那么肯定将有更多的人前去送死。原来的沼泽地将变成一个无底洞”。这家报纸在谈到恢复轰炸的行动时还说，华盛顿许多人认为，“去年轰炸的军事价值很小”，而恢复轰炸对美国摆脱困境也将无济于事，因为“如果从（去年）二月直到十二月进行的紧张轰炸都未能迫使共产党人走向会议桌旁，那么，现在恢复轰炸也只能使他们的抵抗决心更加坚定”。
    西欧和北美加拿大的资产阶级报刊也纷纷指出，美国恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸，并不能挽救美国在南越的败局，只能加深美国政府内外交困的窘境。
    几天来，许多国家的政府和官方人士纷纷发表声明，反对和谴责美国恢复轰炸的侵略行动。连美国的盟国法国政府也在二日发表声明，宣布“法国政府对恢复轰炸只能表示遗憾和不赞同”。法国政府还认为，联合国“没有资格干涉”越南问题。叙利亚外交部发言人二日发表声明，强烈谴责约翰逊关于恢复轰炸越南北方的决定，并且“要求美国停止侵略”。
        欧美人民示威痛斥杀人犯
    美国重新轰炸越南北方的侵略行动，激起了包括美国人民在内的世界各国人民和公众舆论的极大愤慨。纽约公众冒着严寒，举行示威游行，高呼：“结束越南战争！把军队撤回来！”美国人民还在准备向华盛顿进军，表示对政府残杀越南人民的强烈抗议。英国伦敦几十名愤怒的示威群众一日晚上冲进正在开会的下院，他们在旁听席上高呼抗议美国侵略越南和恢复轰炸的口号。在法国、西德、荷兰、瑞士、瑞典、加拿大等许多国家公众也举行示威，痛斥约翰逊是杀人犯。
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲声援越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略斗争委员会一日发表一项声明说，美国恢复轰炸“清楚地证实了约翰逊政府的所谓‘和平攻势’的虚伪性，这是美国执政者的伪善和奸诈的最好证明”。《柬埔寨电讯报》二日的社论说：“现在当然不能对约翰逊之流及其顾问会有所收敛抱有幻想。……几乎可以断定，承袭了希特勒的衣钵的这个冒险家集团显然准备孤注一掷。”坦桑尼亚《民族主义者报》二日发表社论说：“如果我们不谴责美国目前在越南北方的行动，那就是没有尽到我们的职责。”哥斯达黎加社会主义人民联盟党主席马·阿吉卢斯说，“美国轰炸一个离美国数千海里的拥有主权的（国家的）人民，这无疑是美国明目张胆的侵略。”
        北打空中强盗南惩少爷兵
    对于约翰逊政府来说，更严重的问题还在于，它的军事侵略行动遭到了越南北方和南方人民的迎头痛击。在北方，严阵以待的越南军民在四天里击落了十八架美国强盗飞机。在南方，在约翰逊宣布对越南北方恢复轰炸的同时，四万美国侵略军在南越沿海沿一号公路的一百六十多公里地区发动五路进攻，但在越南南方军民的英勇打击下，全部垮台。越南南方解放军还在一月三十一日痛击在南越中部沿海蓬山、绥和、芽庄地区，以及在西贡附近的美国侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军，打得敌人狼狈不堪，使他们受到巨大伤亡和损失。
    貌似强大的美国侵略强盗在英勇的越南军民面前已经越来越显露出它的纸老虎本质。当然，敌人是决不甘心失败的。它还要作疯狂的挣扎，进一步扩大战争，继续推行“和谈”骗局。但是，不管约翰逊政府怎样挣扎，越南人民定将把美国侵略者一个不留地赶出去。
