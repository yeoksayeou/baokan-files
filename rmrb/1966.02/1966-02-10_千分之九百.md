    The upsurge of the American people's struggle against the war of aggression against Vietnam shows that the Johnson government's policy of aggression against Vietnam is extremely unpopular in the United States.
    However, the likes of Johnson insist that their aggressive policies have broad support at home, and that those who oppose them are just a "minority," "accounting for only one per thousand of the American people." This act of "burying one's head in the sand" is ridiculous.
    The Christian Science Monitor conducted a poll among some "men and women who are able to represent the majority of the American people," and concluded that "the vast majority of people oppose this (Vietnam) war." One of the American citizens surveyed confidently said: "At least ninety percent of the people oppose this war." This American bourgeois newspaper obviously did not intend to sabotage Johnson, but it was merely reporting some real situations.
    The Christian Science Monitor's poll not only gave Johnson a resounding slap in the face, but also explained the reason why the broad masses of the American people oppose the war of aggression against Vietnam: They generally believe that this war is unreasonable, and they simply do not believe the Johnson government's deceptive explanations.
    The public opinion in the United States is very clear. The Johnson government insists on its policy of aggression against Vietnam, regardless of the will of the American people, and wants to expand the war. Then, not only will the Vietnamese people and the people of all countries in the world not forgive it, but the American people will certainly not forgive it.

    千分之九百
    美国人民反对侵越战争的斗争浪潮日益高涨，表明约翰逊政府的侵略越南的政策，在美国国内是极不得人心的。
    但是，约翰逊之流却硬说什么，他们的侵略政策在国内得到广泛的支持，反对的只是“少数”，“仅占美国人民的千分之一”。这种“掩耳盗铃”的行径，是十分可笑的。
    《基督教科学箴言报》在一些“能够代表大多数美国人民的男人和妇女”中进行了一次民意调查，得出的结论是“绝大部分人反对这场（侵越）战争”。其中一个被调查的美国公民有把握地说：“人民至少有百分之九十都反对这场战争”。这家美国的资产阶级报纸显然并不是有意要拆约翰逊的台，它不过是报道了一些实在的情况罢了。
    《基督教科学箴言报》的民意调查，不仅给了约翰逊一记响亮的耳光，而且说明了广大美国人民反对侵越战争的原故：普遍认为这场战争是毫无道理的，他们根本不相信约翰逊政府那些骗人的解释。
    美国的民意是十分清楚的。约翰逊政府不顾美国人民的意志坚持它的侵略越南的政策，而且还要扩大战争，那末，不仅越南人民和世界各国人民不会饶恕它，而且美国人民也一定不会饶恕它。
