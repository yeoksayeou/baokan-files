    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th – *U.S. News & World Report*'s military analyst, former U.S. Military Academy Dean, Max Johnson, in an article published in the magazine ahead of its February 7th release, admitted that no matter what operational plan U.S. imperialism adopts in Vietnam, it will face many difficulties and ultimately be defeated in a people's war waged by the Vietnamese people against American aggressors.

    The article said: "The U.S. strategy of gradually increasing troops in Vietnam has almost reached its limit if it is to be effective under the current rules of engagement." The article believes that if the United States wants to continue to stay in South Vietnam, it must choose from the following three operational plans: "(1) Retreat to isolated coastal strongholds and hold on there indefinitely; (2) Establish a defensive cordon across the mountains from the east coast of South Vietnam to the Mekong River, and carry out mopping-up operations inside South Vietnam; (3) Attack North Vietnam with land offensives or large-scale bombings." But the article admits that no matter which operational plan the United States pursues, it will face many difficulties and be defeated.

     Retreating to Isolated Coastal Strongholds Will Face the "Disaster of Dien Bien Phu"

    When discussing the first operational plan, the article said that if the United States "fights a defensive war indefinitely in isolated coastal strongholds in South Vietnam, it may require six to eight divisions—approximately 200,000 to 300,000 men. Such a war would be a static ring defense, based on the isolated strongholds that the U.S. military is currently building on the east coast of South Vietnam. This war may also involve limited counter-offensive actions from these isolated strongholds, including direct land warfare, airborne maneuvers against communist-controlled areas, or limited amphibious operations against targets along the coast of South Vietnam." The article said, "Some U.S. political decision-makers hold this view. Some military personnel also support this view. They compare this approach to a porcupine. No one can easily swallow it. But other military personnel strongly oppose this approach. They say: 'A porcupine can only use its quills for close-range defense.' In addition to the operational dangers, military personnel who oppose this isolated stronghold theory also pointed out some strategic disadvantages of this plan. For example, it gives the initiative to the enemy. The rest of South Vietnam's inland areas, along with its manpower, will be lost without a fight. In addition, there is the danger of a disaster like Dien Bien Phu—U.S. troops being defeated in some isolated strongholds, and the political and psychological losses suffered from such a defeat far exceeding Vietnam. The image of the United States further declines and becomes a 'paper tiger trapped in a bamboo cage'… Therefore, the strategic disadvantages of this plan seem large enough to consider it unrealistic."

    Building a Blockade Line Across South Vietnam Will Entrap More U.S. Troops in the Quagmire

    The article said that the second plan "requires establishing a defense zone across Vietnam and the Laotian panhandle, from the coast to the Mekong River, to cut off the Ho Chi Minh Trail and prevent the supply of enemy troops and weapons from entering South Vietnam. Such a defense zone is approximately 200 miles long." The article admits that to establish such a "defense zone," the United States will have more troops trapped in the South Vietnamese quagmire. The article said, "This plan will require approximately ten to twelve U.S. divisions, and air support will be strengthened accordingly—400,000 troops will be deployed in Vietnam. The logistical burden will increase greatly." The article also said that no one can guess how large the scope of this "defense" should be. "These considerations, coupled with other considerations, have convinced many military planners that this blockade line defense plan, like the coastal isolated site plan," will not enable the United States to achieve its goal of forcing North Vietnam to admit that it must stop the war.

     Expanding the War to the North: Amphibious Landings Are Full of Dangers and Difficulties

    The article said that the third plan's "idea is to fight the war in North Vietnam" and "advance simultaneously from land and air." But the article admits that this approach by the United States is full of dangers and difficulties. The article said, "An amphibious landing through the Gulf of Tonkin to attack North Vietnam may require at least twelve U.S. divisions to conquer the delta, and may require more troops," and it may also cause the risk of fighting with China. At the same time, "preparing for such a major invasion from such a distant place as the United States is impossible to keep secret. And the landing cannot achieve tactical air strikes. Amphibious forces will have to sail 135 miles to reach the Gulf of Tonkin... In addition, there is very limited amphibious equipment currently available, so only a small force can be landed in the initial offensive." The article also said, "U.S. troops cannot conduct such an amphibious effort in this area without guaranteed air superiority." In this situation where it is at a loss for the war of aggression against Vietnam and is at a dead end, the author of the article hysterically clamored that "if the war is to be fought to North Vietnam, other means will be to bomb the country down." The article said, "Some senior U.S. military officials frankly say that this approach is feasible. The U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff has stated categorically in recent weeks that the United States can bomb North Vietnam down." But the article did not dare to admit that the United States has been bombing northern Vietnam for a year, and has not been able to make the Vietnamese people submit.

    The article finally lamented that no matter which method is used, "it will inevitably cost much more than the current (U.S.) war expenditure, both in terms of the efforts and personnel involved."

    美刊承认美帝在侵越战争泥沼中走投无路
    南越的竹笼关住了美国纸老虎
    无论采取哪种作战计划都将面临重重困难必然遭到失败
    新华社七日讯　华盛顿消息：《美国新闻与世界报道》的军事分析员、前美国军事学院院长马克斯·约翰逊在提前于二月七日出版的这家杂志上发表的一篇文章中承认，无论美帝国主义在越南采取哪一种作战计划，在越南人民反对美国侵略者的一场人民战争中，都面临重重困难，终将遭到失败。
    这篇文章说：“美国在越南逐步增加部队的战略如果要在目前的战争规则下有效的话，差不多已经走到尽头了。”文章认为，如果美国要继续赖在南越，就得在下面三种作战计划中作出选择，即“（一）退至沿海孤立据点，无限期地在那里固守；（二）从南越东海岸越过山岭到湄公河建立一条防御警戒线，在南越内部实行肃清作战；（三）以陆地攻势或大规模的轰炸来攻击北越”。但是文章承认，无论美国推行哪一个作战计划，它都面临重重困难，并将遭到失败。
     退守沿海孤立据点  将面临“奠边府的灾难”
    文章在谈到第一种作战计划时说，美国“如果在南越的沿海孤立据点无限期地打一场防御战，这也许需要六个到八个师——大约要二十万人到三十万人。这样一种战争将是一种静止的环形防御，以美国军队现在在南越东海岸修建的孤立据点为基础。这种战争也可能从这些孤立据点采取有限的反攻行动，包括直接的陆地战，对共产党控制的地区进行空中机动或者对南越沿海各地的目标进行有限的两栖作战。”文章说，“美国的某些政治决策人抱的正是这种看法。某些军人也支持这种看法。他们把这种主张比做一只?猪。谁也不能轻易地吞下去。但是另一些军人坚决反对这种主张。他们说：‘一只?猪只能用它的刺来作近距离防御。’除了作战上的危险以外，反对这种孤立据点理论的军人还指出了这一计划的一些战略上的不利条件。例如，把主动性丢给了敌人。南越内地的其余部分连同它的人力都将未经一战地就丧失了。此外还有发生一场象奠边府那样的灾难的危险——美国军队在某些孤立据点被打垮，由于这样一场失败在政治上心理上遭到的损失远远超出越南境外。美国的形象进一步下降而变成‘关在竹笼里的纸老虎’……。因此，这一方案在战略上的不利之处，似乎大得足以认为它是不现实的。”
    横穿南越建封锁线  将使更多美军陷入泥沼
    文章说，第二个计划“要求在横贯越南的地方和老挝狭长地带，从海岸直到湄公河建立一个防区，以切断胡志明小道并阻止敌军和武器的供应进入南越。这样一个防区长约二百英里。”文章承认，要建立这样的“防区”，美国将有更多的军队陷入南越的泥沼中。文章说，“这一计划大约将需要美国十师到十二师，空中支持也将相应加强——在越南将投入四十万兵力。后勤的负担将大大增加。”文章还说，这种“防御”的范围应该有多大，那是谁也猜不准的。“这些考虑加上其他考虑，已使许多军事计划人员相信，这项设封锁线的防御计划，象海岸孤立地点计划一样”，都不会使美国实现强迫北越承认必须停止战争这一目标。
        把战争扩大到北方  两栖登陆充满危险困难
    文章说，第三个计划的“想法是把战争打到北越”，并“从陆上和空中并进”。但是文章承认，美国这种做法充满危险和困难。文章说，“通过东京湾（指北部湾）实行两栖登陆进攻北越，可能至少需要美军十二个师来征服三角洲，可能需要更多的部队”，而且还会引起同中国作战的风险。同时，“从美国这样一个遥远的地方来为这样一个重大的入侵所作的准备是不可能保密的。而且登陆也不能实现战术上的空袭。两栖部队将必须航行一百三十五英里到达东京湾……此外目前可以使用的两栖装备很有限，因此在最初的进攻中只能登陆一个小部队”。文章还说，“美国部队在这个地区不能在没有保证的空中优势的情况下进行这样一种两栖努力”。在这种对侵越战争一筹莫展，走投无路的情况下，文章的作者歇斯底里地叫嚷说，“如果要把战争打到北越的话，其他的办法将是通过空袭把这个国家打垮。”文章说，“一些高级美国军事官员们坦白地说，这个方针是可行的。美国空军参谋长最近若干星期来断然地说，美国能够通过轰炸把北越打垮。”但是文章不敢承认，美国已对越南北方进行了长达一年的轰炸，并没有能够使越南人民屈服。
    文章最后哀叹，不管用哪一种办法，“都势必比目前（美国）的战争开支代价要多得多，不管是在所涉及的努力和人员方面都是这样。”
