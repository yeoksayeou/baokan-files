　　Yeyuan Irrigation District Relies on the Masses for Water Conservancy Infrastructure
　　(Our report) The staff of the Yeyuan Reservoir Management Bureau in Linqu County, Shandong Province, have implemented the policy of relying on the masses to develop water conservancy and serving agricultural production. They have mobilized the masses to self-reliantly build field infrastructure, expand the irrigated area, and maximize the benefits of the project; they have gone deep into the communes and teams to establish model fields for irrigation and increased production, and have done everything possible to manage and utilize water conservancy facilities to serve agricultural production.
    The Yeyuan Reservoir and the Laolongwan irrigation project form an irrigation system. When water was first released for irrigation in 1960, the canal system was not complete enough. The Reservoir Management Bureau mobilized the masses to dig ditches and ridges in the fields for irrigation; at the same time, they personally grasped the base points and cultivated models for self-reliantly building canal systems. In that year, wherever the field infrastructure was well-built, production increased. The average yield per mu in the entire irrigation area of ​​more than 40,000 mu was 410 jin, an increase of more than 100 jin per mu compared to areas without irrigation. In 1961, there were only 63 canals and 419 buildings in the entire irrigation area; by 1964, it had developed to more than 250 canals and 2,170 buildings, expanding the irrigated area by more than 20,000 mu and improving the irrigated area by more than 30,000 mu. In 1965, more than 710 irrigation and drainage canals, 29 mechanized farming roads, and more than 1,430 buildings were built. All funds and materials used in the project were solved by the communes and teams themselves. Now, the irrigated area in the entire irrigation district has expanded from more than 40,000 mu in 1960 to more than 130,000 mu.
    The staff of the Yeyuan Irrigation District have established the view of developing water conservancy for agricultural production and have done everything possible to serve agricultural production. They went deep into the communes and teams to establish irrigation and production increase model fields, using the facts of irrigation and production increase to educate the masses. During the spring irrigation period in 1961, they established 13 irrigation model fields to conduct comparative irrigation and production increase experiments, with 31 comparison items. On April 15 of that year, a serious frost disaster occurred. According to observations, the frost damage rate of the main stems of wheat irrigated three days before the frost was 16.5%, while the frost damage rate of wheat that was not irrigated was as high as 87.9%. The effect of watering immediately after the frost was also significant. During the summer harvest, the wheat that was watered after being frozen yielded an average of 78 jin per mu more than the wheat that was not watered. The masses saw the effect of spring irrigation in preventing frost and increasing production from the model fields, and their enthusiasm for building field infrastructure was even higher, thus rapidly expanding the irrigated area.
    The staff of the Yeyuan Reservoir Management Bureau have studied and explored the laws of scientific water use from all aspects. They conduct regular measurements throughout the year to grasp the law of soil moisture content decline and make forecasts; they insist on planting experimental fields every year to explore irrigation systems that are compatible with the water needs of crops; they go deep into communes and teams to help production teams summarize the experience of watering comparison experiments with different soils, different fertilizers, and different crops. Before the spring wheat irrigation last year, the Management Bureau sent more than 20 people to 16 representative production brigades for investigation. Through the investigation, they found that due to the high temperature, low soil moisture content, and large soil voids in the spring of last year, in addition to starting spring irrigation earlier, they also paid attention to irrigating sandy loam and high-lying land first, followed by clay loam and low-lying land; irrigating strong seedlings first, followed by weak seedlings. According to the characteristics of sandy loam and clay loam, it was advocated that the water consumption of the two should be different. Due to reasonable irrigation, coupled with other production increase measures, last year, the 81,000 mu of wheat in this irrigation area, although the rainfall during the entire growing period was half less than in the same period in previous years, still achieved a good harvest with an average yield of 377 jin per mu.

### 冶源灌区依靠群众进行水利配套

　　冶源灌区依靠群众进行水利配套
    本报讯　山东临朐县冶源水库管理局职工，贯彻依靠群众办水利，为农业增产办水利的方针，发动群众自力更生修好田间配套工程，扩大灌溉面积，发挥工程效益；深入社、队建立灌溉增产样板田，千方百计管好用好水利设施，为农业增产服务。
    冶源水库与老龙湾灌溉工程形成一个灌溉系统。一九六○年开始放水灌溉时，渠系不够完整，水库管理局就一面发动群众在田间开沟打畦进行灌溉；一面亲自抓基点，培养自力更生进行渠系配套的样板。这一年，凡是田间配套工程搞得好的地方，都获得增产。全灌区的四万多亩耕地平均亩产四百一十斤，比不灌的每亩增产一百多斤。一九六一年，全灌区只有六十三条渠道、四百一十九座建筑物；到一九六四年就发展到二百五十多条渠道、二千一百七十座建筑物，扩大灌溉面积两万多亩，改善灌溉面积三万多亩。一九六五年，又建成灌、排渠道七百一十多条、机耕路二十九条、建筑物一千四百三十多座。工程所用的资金、物料，全部是社、队自己解决的。现在，全灌区的灌溉面积已由一九六○年的四万多亩扩大到十三万多亩。
    冶源灌区的职工树立了为农业增产办水利的观点，千方百计为农业增产服务。他们深入社、队，建立灌溉增产样板田，用灌溉增产的事实教育群众。一九六一年春灌期间，他们就建立了十三处灌溉样板田，作灌溉增产对比试验，对比项目三十一个。这一年的四月十五日发生了严重冻灾，据观测，冻前三天浇水的小麦主茎受冻率百分之十六点五，未浇水的受冻率高达百分之八十七点九。冻后马上浇水的效果也很显著。夏收时，受冻浇水的小麦，比不浇水的平均每亩增产七十八斤。群众从样板田看到了春灌防冻增产的效果，兴修田间配套工程的积极性更高，因而迅速扩大了灌溉面积。
    冶源水库管理局职工，从各方面研究、摸索科学用水的规律。他们一年四季进行定期实测，掌握土壤含水率下降规律，进行预报；年年坚持种试验田，摸索与农作物需水相适应的灌溉制度；深入社队，帮助生产队总结不同土壤、不同肥料、不同作物等浇水对比试验的经验。去年小麦春灌以前，管理局派出二十多人，到有代表性的十六个生产大队进行调查。通过调查，他们根据去年春天气温高、土壤含水少和土壤空隙大等情况，除了提前春灌以外，在春灌的安排上还注意先浇砂壤地、高亢地，后浇粘壤地和洼地；先浇壮苗，后浇弱苗。又根据砂壤地、粘壤地的特点，主张两者的用水量应有所不同。由于浇水合理，加上其它增产措施，去年这个灌区的八万一千亩小麦，虽然在整个生长期间，降雨量比往年同期少一半，仍然获得了平均亩产三百七十七斤的好收成。（附图片）
