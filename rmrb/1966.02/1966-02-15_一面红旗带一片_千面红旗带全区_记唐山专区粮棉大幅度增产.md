    A Single Red Flag Leads an Area; A Thousand Red Flags Lead the Entire Region
    – On the Large-Scale Increase in Grain and Cotton Production in the Tangshan Special District

    The broad masses of commune members and cadres in the Tangshan Special District of Hebei Province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carrying forward the spirit of the "poor stick," and after achieving relatively good harvests in grain for two consecutive years, overcame severe drought in 1965 and achieved a bumper harvest of grain and cotton. The total output and per-mu yield of more than 9.7 million mu of grain crops in the entire special district increased by more than 25 percent compared to 1964; the 650,000 mu of cotton also increased by more than 44 percent compared to 1964. Grain and cotton yields both exceeded historical highs. Of the fourteen counties (cities) and one state-owned farm in the entire special district, only Zunhua County had an average grain yield of over 400 jin per mu in 1964. In 1965, seven counties (cities) and one state-owned farm, including Zunhua, Funing, Leting, Qian’an, Qianxi, Fengrun, and Tangshan City, achieved the targets set in the "National Agricultural Development Program."

    The Tangshan Special District is located in northeastern Hebei, facing the Bohai Sea to the southeast, leaning against the Great Wall to the north, and bordering the Tianjin area to the west. Of the more than 11 million mu of cultivated land in the entire district, more than half is mountainous, hilly, low-lying saline-alkali, and sandy land. The water conservancy conditions here are very poor, with irrigated land accounting for only 15 percent of the total cultivated land in the entire district. There are frequent spring droughts and autumn floods, and agricultural production is extremely unstable.

    First, Grasp the Revolutionization of Leadership

    Grasping the revolutionization of leadership is the fundamental reason for the large-scale increase in grain and cotton production in the Tangshan Special District. In 1964, Zunhua County in Tangshan Special District achieved a yield of more than 400 jin of grain per mu because the county party committee acted in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, correctly summarized historical experience, established the ambition to dare to make revolution and dare to win, and mobilized the masses to deeply carry out the movement of comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing. This event caused great shock throughout the special district. People asked themselves, Zunhua County's production conditions are not better than ours, so why can they do it, but we can’t? Therefore, leaders at all levels mobilized the masses to recall the production situation in recent years, exposing the backwardness in production and spiritual state. While checking the "middle-of-the-road" ideology, Lulong, Luan County, Leting, Tangshan, and other counties (cities) checked problems such as not daring to boldly learn from other places' experiences and not daring to boldly promote their own experiences; some checked the metaphysical views of not daring to establish benchmarks and red flags and demanding perfection from advanced units. The Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China also organized responsible cadres from various counties (cities) to visit and study advanced areas such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shandong. In this way, leading departments in various counties (cities), on the basis of admitting backwardness but not being willing to lag behind, actively launched activities to learn from Zunhua and formulated specific plans and measures for learning from and catching up with Zunhua.

    Cadres going down to stay at selected points, exploring and summarizing experiences, and then using points to lead the area, thereby overcoming the problem of generalized leadership, is a concrete manifestation of the leadership revolutionization in the Tangshan area. The Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that whether cadres are determined to go down to stay at selected points is a question of whether they dare to make revolution and whether they are determined to lead the three great revolutionary movements. Under the advocacy of the prefectural committee, most of the standing committee members of the prefectural committee and all county party secretaries went down to stay at selected points. They led 80 percent of district (work committee) secretaries and about 70 percent of commune party committee secretaries to also go down to stay at selected points. Everyone learned from the experience of Fan Defu, secretary of the Wangdouzhuang Commune in Qian'an County, in staying at selected points to transform backward teams. In this way, more than 13,000 cadres in the entire district went to work at the grassroots level in rural areas. It is understood that the vast majority of brigades with cadres stationed there have changed their appearance. Not only have more than 700 advanced brigades become more advanced, with a large increase in grain and cotton production, but also most of the backward brigades have also basically changed their appearance, and some have even caught up with and surpassed the advanced teams. Through staying at selected points, a large number of leading cadres have been trained, and their relationship with the masses has become closer.

    Establish Benchmarks and Set Examples Everywhere

    Another basic reason for the large-scale increase in grain and cotton production in the Tangshan Special District is that the leaders of various counties (cities) conscientiously promote the experience of Zunhua County and deeply carry out the mass movement of comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing. Based on Zunhua County's experiences of "a single red flag leading an area, a hundred red flags leading the entire county" and "helping old models perform new plays, grasping backward teams as a red spot, giving a hand to those in difficulty, and helping those who have fallen," as well as "establishing new ones to promote old ones, helping the weak and supporting those who have fallen, and grasping the big to lead the small," they established benchmarks and red flags, successively establishing more than 1,900 red flag brigades. Among these red flag teams, there are old advanced units, and a considerable number are rising stars. In addition to the red flag of Zunhua County continuing to be held high, advanced models such as Fengnan County's high cotton yield on terraced fields, Qian'an and Luannan's accumulation of manure, and Leting and Qinhuangdao City's careful selection of fine seeds have emerged throughout the special district. The emergence of these advanced units has further promoted production throughout the special district. In order to make it easier for the broad masses of commune members to see, touch, learn from, catch up with, help, and confidently surpass the benchmarks and models, the entire special district organized more than 1,700 competition groups between major brigades, with three to five production teams as one group, each group having a top unit, regularly exchanging experiences, and carrying out comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing competitions. Competition groups were also formed between communes, between districts (work committees), and between counties, driving each level. This competition is combined with current agricultural activities, and different content is proposed according to different seasons. For example, in spring, the competition is for preparing for plowing and drought-resistant sowing; in summer, the competition is for field management; in autumn, the competition is for careful harvesting and wheat planting; and in winter, the competition is for basic farmland construction, thereby effectively promoting production activities in various periods. The Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that carrying out the evaluation and competition of five-good production teams and five-good commune members is the mass basis for carrying out the movement of comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing. In 1965, the entire district had conducted three or four five-good evaluation activities, successively selecting more than 8,900 five-good production teams, accounting for one-fourth of the total number of production teams in the entire special district; more than 350,000 five-good commune members were selected, accounting for 22 percent of the total number of commune members in the entire special district. Facts have proved that each time a "five-good" evaluation is carried out, the mass movement of comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing is pushed to a new climax; the better the "five-good" evaluation is carried out, the better the comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing competition will be. Now, the situation of "a single red flag leading an area, a thousand red flags leading the entire region" has been formed in the entire special district. More than 1,300 brigades in the entire district, which were originally relatively backward in production, can catch up with or approach the level of more advanced production teams this year; the production of many old advanced units has also developed to varying degrees. According to statistics from 358 old red flag units in Zunhua and other five counties, more than 270 old advanced units made new achievements in 1965.

    Carry Forward the Spirit of the "Poor Stick"

    Carrying forward the spirit of the "poor stick," using indigenous methods, putting in painstaking effort, and grasping the key measures for increasing production in the current year are the third basic reason for the large-scale increase in grain and cotton production in the Tangshan Special District. According to the local poor water conservancy conditions and long-term drought, the broad masses of cadres and commune members concentrated their efforts on fighting hard battles in drought prevention and drought resistance and moisture retention. In the spring of 1965, the commune members harrowed and rolled the fields that had been plowed last autumn five or six times, seizing the moisture to rush plant more than 6.5 million mu of field crops. Later, as the drought continued to develop, the broad masses of cadres and commune members neither relied on the sky for rain nor simply reached out to higher authorities, but relied on the "two shoulders, one carrying pole," and the animal-drawn and human-carried methods of "one cart, one water tank" to transport water for drought resistance, rush planting, and protect seedlings. During the most severe drought in May and June, more than 1 million laborers in the entire district used water to plant more than 2.4 million mu of crops, accounting for one-fourth of the entire spring sowing task. In the struggle against drought, a large number of "iron shoulders," "iron feet," "iron men," and "iron girls" emerged throughout the special district. The Shashi峪 Brigade of the Yuegezhuang Commune in Zunhua County, famous for its "Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains" spirit, more than 80 laborers carried more than 70,000 loads of water for drought resistance for more than two months, accumulating a total distance of 410,000 li, with an average of 5,000 li per person, and finally achieved a good harvest of more than 560 jin of grain per mu. Long-term drought prevention and drought resistance have also forced people to use their ingenuity. The experience of drought-resistant and yield-guaranteed corn planting in pits created by the masses in Zunhua, Qian'an, and other counties has attracted the attention of various places. Now, more than 750,000 mu of pit fields have been dug throughout the district, laying the foundation for timely spring sowing this year. At the same time, the entire district increased the irrigated area by more than 800,000 mu in 1965, equivalent to more than double the previous irrigated land. The entire district also built nearly one million mu of terraced fields and strip fields, and the drainage area has also increased. These works played an important role in ensuring the bumper harvest of grain and cotton in 1965.

    一面红旗带一片　千面红旗带全区
    ——记唐山专区粮棉大幅度增产
    河北省唐山专区广大社员和干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬“穷棒子”精神，在连续两年粮食获得较好收成之后，一九六五年又战胜严重干旱灾害，粮棉获得大丰收。全专区九百七十多万亩粮食作物，总产和亩产都比一九六四年增长百分之二十五以上；六十五万亩棉花，也比一九六四年增产百分之四十四以上。粮棉产量都超过了历史最高水平。全专区十四个县（市）和一个国营农场，一九六四年只有遵化县粮食平均亩产四百斤以上，一九六五年就有遵化、抚宁、乐亭、迁安、迁西、丰润、唐山市等七个县（市）和一个国营农场粮食平均亩产达到“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标。
    唐山专区地处河北东北部，东南面临渤海，北倚长城，西接天津地区。全区一千一百多万亩耕地，一半以上是山地、丘陵地、低洼盐碱和风沙地。这里的水利条件很差，水浇地面积仅占全专区总耕地面积的百分之十五，经常是春旱秋涝，农业生产极不稳定。
    首先抓领导革命化
    大抓领导革命化，是唐山专区粮棉大幅度增产的基本原因。一九六四年，唐山专区的遵化县，由于县委按照毛主席思想办事，正确总结了历史经验，树立敢于革命敢于胜利的雄心壮志，发动群众深入开展比学赶帮超运动，因而获得了亩产粮食四百多斤的成绩。这件事在全专区各地引起了极大的震动。人们纷纷自问，遵化县生产条件并不比我们这里好，为什么他们能办到的，我们却没有办到？于是，各级领导发动群众回忆几年来的生产情况，揭了生产和精神状态方面的落后盖子。卢龙、滦县、乐亭、唐山等县（市）在检查“中游”思想的同时，有的检查了对外地经验不敢大胆学、对自己的经验不敢大胆推广的问题；有的检查了有标兵、红旗不敢树立和要求先进单位完美无缺的形而上学观点。中共唐山地委还组织各县（市）负责干部到北京、天津、山东等先进地区参观学习。这样，各县（市）领导部门在承认落后、但又不甘落后的基础上，积极展开学习遵化的活动，制订了学赶遵化的具体规划和措施。
    干部下去蹲点，摸索和总结经验，然后以点带面，从而克服领导一般化问题，是唐山地区领导革命化的一个具体表现。中共唐山地委认为，干部有没有决心下去蹲点，是敢不敢革命的问题，也是有没有决心领导三大革命运动的问题。在地委倡导之下，地委大部分常委和全体县委书记都下去蹲点。他们带动了百分之八十的区（工委）委书记和百分之七十左右的公社党委书记也下去蹲点。大家都学习迁安县大望都庄公社社长范德富蹲点改造落后队的经验。这样，全区到农村基层工作的干部即达一万三千多人。据了解，有干部蹲点的大队，绝大多数都改变了面貌。不仅七百多个先进大队，先进再先进，粮棉产量大幅度增长，而且大部分后进大队也基本改变了面貌，有的还赶上和超过了先进队。通过蹲点，还使大批领导干部受到锻炼，同群众的关系更加密切了。
    处处树标兵立样板
    唐山专区粮棉大幅度增产的另一个基本原因，是各县（市）领导认真推广遵化县的经验，深入开展比学赶帮超的群众运动。他们根据遵化县“一面红旗带一片，百面红旗带全县”和“帮老模范排新戏，抓后进队一点红，对困难的拉一把，把跌倒的扶起来”，以及“树新的促老的，帮弱的扶倒的，抓大的带小的”等经验，大树标兵红旗，先后树立起一千九百多个红旗大队。这些红旗队中，有老先进单位，还有相当一部分是后起之秀。全专区除了遵化县这面红旗继续高举以外，还涌现出丰南县台田棉花高产，迁安、滦南多积肥，乐亭、秦皇岛市精选良种等先进样板。这些先进单位的涌现，进一步对全专区的生产起了推动作用。为了使广大社员对标兵、样板看得见，摸得着，学起来方便，赶起来有劲，帮的容易，超有信心，全专区在各大队之间，以三五个生产队为一片，组织了一千七百多个竞赛片，每片有一个尖子单位，定期交流经验，开展比学赶帮超竞赛。在公社和公社之间，在区（工委）与区、县与县之间，也组成了竞赛片，层层带动。这种竞赛同当前农事活动相结合，根据不同季节提出不同内容。例如，春天比备耕，比抗旱播种，夏季比田间管理，秋季比精收细打和种麦，冬季比农田基本建设，从而有效地促进了各个时期的生产活动。中共唐山地委认为，开展好五好生产队、五好社员的评比竞赛，是开展比学赶帮超的群众基础。一九六五年全区已进行过三四次五好评比活动，先后评出五好生产队八千九百多个，占全专区生产队总数的四分之一；评出五好社员三十五万多人，占全专区社员总数的百分之二十二。事实证明，每评比一次“五好”，就把比学赶帮超的群众运动推向一个新的高潮；那里“五好”评比开展得好，比学赶帮超竞赛也就好。现在，全专区已经形成“一面红旗带一片，千面红旗带全区”的局面。全区已有一千三百多个原来生产比较落后的大队，今年可以赶上或接近较先进的生产队的水平；许多老先进单位的生产，也有了不同程度的发展。据遵化等五个县三百五十八个老红旗单位统计，一九六五年就有二百七十多个老先进单位作出了新的成绩。
    发扬“穷棒子”精神
    发扬“穷棒子”精神，用土办法，下笨功夫，狠抓当年增产的关键措施，是唐山专区粮棉大幅度增产的第三个基本原因。广大干部和社员根据当地水利条件较差和长期干旱的情况，集中力量在防旱抗旱和保墒方面打硬仗。一九六五年春，社员们在去秋已经耕过的地里耙轧了五六遍，趁墒抢种了六百五十多万亩大田作物。后来旱情继续发展，广大干部和社员既没有靠天等雨，也没有单纯向上伸手，而是靠“两个肩膀，一条扁担”、“一个大车、一个水柜”的畜拉人担办法，运水抗旱抢种和保苗。在干旱最严重的五六月间，全区一百多万个劳动力，用水点种了二百四十多万亩作物，占整个春播任务的四分之一。在抗旱斗争中，全专区出现了大批“铁肩膀”、“铁脚掌”、“铁汉子”、“铁姑娘”。以“愚公移山”精神出名的遵化县岳各庄公社沙石峪大队，八十多名劳力，两个多月抗旱担水七万多担，累计行程四十一万里，每人平均行走五千里，终于抗出了粮食亩产五百六十多斤的好收成。长期的防旱抗旱，也逼着人们在巧字上打主意。遵化、迁安等县，群众创造的坑播玉米抗旱保收的经验，引起各地注意。现在全区已挖垵子田七十五万多亩，给今年按时春播打下基础。同时，全区一九六五年增加了灌溉面积八十多万亩，相当于过去水浇地的一倍多。全区还修了近百万亩台田和条田，排涝面积也有所增加。这些工作，对保证一九六五年粮棉丰收起了重要作用。
