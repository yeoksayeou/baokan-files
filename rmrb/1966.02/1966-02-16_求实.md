    Seek Truth from Facts

    In the current high tide of industrial and agricultural production, the broad masses of cadres and people are full of energy and enthusiasm, all wanting to do more, faster, better, and more economically. Under this excellent situation, we must strengthen leadership to make people's subjective desires consistent with objective reality, and to make aspirations consistent with possibilities, turning ideals into reality. We must focus on ensuring that all our work achieves practical results.

    For example:

    When developing water conservancy, it must be able to achieve practical irrigation effects;
    When developing fertilizers, it must be able to fertilize the fields;
    When launching the increase production and practice economy movement, we must truly achieve more, faster, better, and more economical, and accelerate the development of the national economy.

    That is to say, all our work must emphasize practical results, and we must not pursue superficial enthusiasm. Leading organs at all levels must pay serious attention to this issue and prevent "pursuing empty reputations and reaping real disasters."

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We should handle affairs honestly; to accomplish a few things in the world, an honest attitude is essential." This will always be our motto.

    The Chinese people have a very high level of socialist enthusiasm, and our Party has a very high prestige among the people. Under the conditions of universally carrying out the socialist education movement, and in the high tide of production, mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of grassroots cadres and the broad masses of people is generally relatively easy. However, after the revolutionary enthusiasm of grassroots cadres and the broad masses of people is boosted, emphasizing the combination of revolutionary enthusiasm and a spirit of seeking truth from facts, and guiding the broad masses to advance steadily and practically, becomes relatively less easy. To solve these problems well, we must consciously act in accordance with "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." When comrades in Ningxia dealt with certain problems in the high tide of production, they specifically analyzed contradictions and solved them in a pragmatic way, demonstrating a spirit of seeking truth from facts, which is very inspiring.

    The spirit of seeking truth from facts that we advocate is that, in the high tide of production, on the one hand, we must fully promote the revolutionary spirit, fearing neither heaven nor earth, believing in neither evil nor ghosts, daring to transform heaven and earth, and daring to advance courageously. Our spirit must be boosted and not dampened. We must give prominence to politics and constantly improve the revolutionary enthusiasm and initiative of the masses. With this full revolutionary spirit, we will be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties and achieve greater and greater victories in the three great revolutionary movements. On the other hand, we must adhere to dialectical materialism, use revolutionary dialectics, seek truth from facts, advance steadily, constantly summarize experience, and correct mistakes in a timely manner. We advocate rhythm in work arrangements and allow for intervals in work steps. In Wu Zhong County, Ningxia, some problems occurred in water conservancy construction, such as incomplete projects and insufficient quality. The county party committee resolutely suspended the project temporarily, summarized experience, re-planned, and re-organized for battle. As a result, the project was not slower or worse, but faster and better. In many areas of Ningxia, the masses accumulated soil fertilizer (i.e., what some people call "moving yellow soil"), which used too much labor and affected the arrangement of other farm work; and because the wall soil was replaced too quickly, it reduced the fertilizer effect. The responsible comrades of the Autonomous Region Party Committee comprehensively analyzed this situation, persuaded the masses to appropriately reduce the labor for accumulating soil fertilizer, and take into account other farm work. As a result of adopting reasonable measures, more fertilizer was accumulated, and other farm work was also done very well. It is very obvious that in these two matters, if we did not adopt this method of "stopping for a while" and "reducing a little," and continued to do as before, it would inevitably be counterproductive, wasting the labor of the masses, and not achieving practical results, which would dampen the enthusiasm of the broad masses.

    Is letting the enthusiastic masses who are building water conservancy temporarily stop, and reducing the labor participating in "moving yellow soil," "pouring cold water" on the masses? No. "Pouring cold water" on the masses means standing on the opposite side of the masses, not conducting any specific analysis of things, and simply negating everything of the masses. This would dampen the enthusiasm of the masses, and we resolutely oppose this practice. Whether we encourage the masses to do something, or persuade the masses not to do something, we must, as Comrade Mao Zedong taught, grasp "two principles: one is the actual needs of the masses, not the needs we imagine in our minds; the other is the voluntariness of the masses, decided by the masses themselves, not by us substituting for the masses." The comrades in Ningxia grasped these two principles, and conducted patient persuasion and education to the masses who were building water conservancy and accumulating soil fertilizer. The enthusiasm of the masses was higher, not lower, and things were done well, not badly.

    Thorough materialists are fearless. In order to promote the continuous development of the high tide of production, we must promote a spirit of high responsibility to the Party and the people, uphold the interests of the Party and the people, adhere to the truth, and dare to change all plans and measures that do not conform to objective reality. We must adhere to the working method of the mass line, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, patiently discuss things with the masses, and, together with the masses, correct various inappropriate practices in the course of advancement, just as the responsible comrades of the Party Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region solved the so-called "moving yellow soil" problem by working alongside the masses.

    No matter what work is done, it is common to find that plans are inappropriate and must be revised midway; and it is also occasional that cadres and the masses have high enthusiasm and want to do more and faster, but encounter practical difficulties. This is an inevitable situation in the process of things' development. We cannot avoid it, but must treat it seriously. We must adhere to a scientific attitude, promote a spirit of seeking truth from facts, hold firm determination, and use appropriate methods to persuade cadres and the masses to revise inappropriate plans and change incorrect practices. Combining cold and heat, with cold in heat, is a scientific attitude. Our leaders at all levels should play such a leading role.

    Twenty-four years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The proletariat has only one sharpest and most effective weapon, that is, a serious and militant scientific attitude." In the long-term revolution and construction, we have deeply realized that: whenever and on whatever issue we strictly act in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching, our cause can be successful and development will be faster; if we violate Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching, our cause will suffer setbacks and development will be slower. The better the situation, the more we should pay attention to the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and make our work more solid and better.

### 求实

专栏：社论

    求实
    在当前工农业生产高潮中，广大干部、群众干劲很足，热气腾腾，都想干得多些、快些、好些、省些。在这种大好形势下，我们必须加强领导，使人们的主观和客观相符合，使愿望和可能相一致，把理想变成现实。我们要着力使各项工作都能得到实际的效果。
    举例来说：
    搞水利，就一定要能够收到灌溉的实效；
    搞肥料，就一定要能够起肥田的作用；
    开展增产节约运动，就一定要真正做到多快好省，加速国民经济的发展。
    这就是说，我们的一切工作，一定要讲求实效，一定不能追求形式上的轰轰烈烈。各级领导机关必须认真注意这个问题，防止“务虚名而得实祸”。
    毛泽东同志说过：“我们应该是老老实实地办事；在世界上要办成几件事，没有老实态度是根本不行的。”这永远是我们的座右铭。
    我国人民有很高的社会主义积极性，我们党在人民群众中有很高的威信。在普遍开展社会主义教育运动的条件下，在生产高潮中，把基层干部和广大群众的革命干劲调动起来，一般说是比较容易的。而在基层干部和广大群众的革命干劲鼓足以后，强调革命干劲和求实精神相结合，引导广大群众踏踏实实地逐步前进，就比较地不那么容易。为了很好地解决这些问题，我们必须自觉地按照《实践论》、《矛盾论》办事。宁夏的同志们在生产高潮中处理某些问题时，具体分析矛盾，实事求是地解决矛盾，表现了求实精神，对人很有启发。
    我们提倡的求实精神，就是在生产高潮中，一方面，要充分发扬革命精神，天不怕，地不怕，不信邪，不信鬼，敢于改天换地，敢于一往无前。气可鼓而不可泄。我们要突出政治，不断提高群众的革命热情和积极性。有了这股子饱满的革命劲头，就能够克服万千困难，在三大革命运动中取得越来越大的胜利。另一方面，我们要坚持辩证唯物论，运用革命辩证法，实事求是，稳步前进，不断总结经验，及时改正错误，在工作安排上提倡有节奏，在工作步骤上允许有间歇。宁夏吴忠县兴修水利，发生了一些工程不配套、质量不够高的问题。县委坚决把工程暂时停一停，总结经验，重作规划，整军再战。结果，工程修得不是慢了差了，而是更快更好了。宁夏许多地区群众积土肥（即有些人所说的“黄土搬家”），用的劳力过多，影响了其他农活的安排；并且由于换墙土太快，降低了肥效。自治区党委负责同志全面分析了这种情况，说服群众适当减少积土肥的劳力，兼顾其他农活。由于采取了合理的措施，肥料积的更多，别的农活也做的很好。十分明显，在这两件事情上，如果不采取这种“停一停”、“减一减”的办法，而按照原来的样子干下去，势必事倍功半，浪费了群众的劳动力，得不到实际效果，这就会挫伤广大群众的积极性。
    让热火朝天修水利的群众暂时停一下，让参加“黄土搬家”的劳力减少些，这不是给群众“泼冷水”么？不是。给群众“泼冷水”，是站在群众的反面，不对事物进行任何具体分析，简单地否定群众的一切。这就会挫伤群众的积极性，我们坚决反对这种做法。我们鼓励群众做什么，或者说服群众不做什么，都要象毛泽东同志所教导的那样，掌握“两条原则：一条是群众的实际上的需要，而不是我们脑子里头幻想出来的需要；一条是群众的自愿，由群众自己下决心，而不是由我们代替群众下决心”。宁夏的同志们掌握了这两条原则，对修水利、积土肥的群众进行耐心的说服教育，群众的积极性是更高了而不是低了，事情是做好了而不是做坏了。
    彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的。为了推进生产高潮的不断发展，我们要发扬对党对人民高度负责的精神，为维护党和人民的利益，坚持真理，勇于改变一切不符合客观实际的计划和措施。我们要坚持群众路线的工作方法，虚心地倾听群众的意见，耐心地跟群众商量办事，同群众一起，在前进中纠正各种不恰当的做法，就象宁夏回族自治区党委负责同志在同群众一道背土中，解决所谓“黄土搬家”问题那样。
    不论做什么工作，中途发现计划不当，而必须加以修改的事情是常有的；干部、群众热情很高，想多干快干而遇到实际困难的事情也间或有的。这是事物发展过程中难免出现的情况，我们不能回避它，而要严肃认真地对待它。我们要坚持科学的态度，发扬求实的精神，抱坚定的决心，用妥善的办法，说服干部、群众修改不适当的计划，改变不对头的做法。冷热结合，热中有冷，这是科学的态度。我们各级领导应该发挥这样的领导作用。
    二十四年前，毛泽东同志说过：“无产阶级的最尖锐最有效的武器只有一个，那就是严肃的战斗的科学态度。”在长期革命和建设中，我们深刻地体会到：在什么时候、什么问题上，我们严格地按照毛泽东同志这个教导办事，我们的事业就能获得成功，发展就会快些；如果违背了毛泽东同志这个教导，我们的事业就会遭受挫折，发展就会慢些。形势越好，我们应该越加注意求实精神，把我们的工作作得越扎实、越好。
