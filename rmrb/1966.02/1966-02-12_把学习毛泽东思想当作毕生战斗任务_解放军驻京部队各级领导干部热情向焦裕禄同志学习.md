    According to Xinhua News Agency, February 11th: Leading cadres at all levels of the People's Liberation Army garrison in Beijing have been reading the news reports introducing the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu again and again in recent days. Many people have expressed their determination excitedly in meetings, both large and small, and in their study notes and learning experiences: to be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, to engage in revolution for a lifetime, to study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, to transform our thinking for a lifetime, and to maintain the youthfulness of revolution forever.
    Recently, the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, various services and arms, and the Beijing Military Region's organs at and above the regimental level have been conducting rectification studies to implement the spirit of the recent All-Army Political Work Conference. The deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, like a spiritual atomic bomb, immediately became a new driving force for further promoting this study. Some have included the study of Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds in the conference agenda, and some have extended the conference time to specifically organize discussions. The Three-Level Cadre Meeting of the Anti-Chemical Warfare Corps concluded, but in order to study Comrade Jiao Yulu, the attendees were kept behind for a two-day discussion. Leading cadres of various departments took the lead in studying and delivering enlightening reports during the study. Qiu Huizuo, Director of the General Logistics Department, and Li Zhen, Political Commissar of a certain unit, both called on all cadres in their respective units to take Jiao Yulu as an example to promote the revolutionization of thinking and the revolutionization of organs.
    How can we learn the revolutionary spirit of Comrade Jiao Yulu? Many cadres at and above the regimental level, with questions such as "How can we better engage in revolution in the second half of our lives?", focused on studying Comrade Jiao Yulu's commitment to studying Mao Zedong Thought as a lifelong combat task, wholeheartedly for the revolution and wholeheartedly for the people. Cadres of the General Staff Department, the General Political Department, and the leading organs of the Air Force, Artillery, Engineering Corps, Armored Corps, Railway Corps, Signal Corps, and Public Security Forces, among others, used Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror to compare themselves and identify their shortcomings. Some said: Their thinking is not as good as Jiao Yulu's; he had all the people in his heart, and no thought of "self," while they still had selfish and miscellaneous thoughts. Some said: Their work is not as good as Jiao Yulu's; Comrade Jiao Yulu rushed forward even when difficulties were greater, while they lacked that kind of drive. Others found that their work style was not as good as Jiao Yulu's, saying that Comrade Jiao Yulu always paid attention to going deep into reality and conducting investigations and research, while they were not like that with the troops. In addition, some people also examined themselves for not treating the masses in the way that Comrade Jiao Yulu did, always sharing the same breath and destiny with the broad masses of the people. Everyone believes that all the differences boil down to the fact that their study of Chairman Mao's works is not as solid as Comrade Jiao Yulu's, and they do not use them as well.
    In recent days, colleges, hospitals, factories, art troupes, and scientific research departments of the Beijing garrison have also held symposiums, report meetings, and broadcast rallies to widely carry out activities to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu. All teachers and students of the PLA Academy of Arts suspended their regular classes and held special discussions on learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu. Actors and staff members of the General Political Department's Song and Dance Troupe and the August First Film Studio repeatedly studied the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu during breaks in rehearsing their programs. Many cadres above the department level of the "Hard Struggle 261 Hospital," which was awarded the honorary title by the Ministry of National Defense, expressed excitedly in their studies that they would treat the sick and wounded as Comrade Jiao Yulu treated the poor and lower-middle peasants; that they would solve the difficulties in medical technology as Comrade Jiao Yulu led the people to change the face of nature; and that they would fight against diseases as Comrade Jiao Yulu tenaciously fought, becoming a hard bone for the Chinese and world revolution.

    把学习毛泽东思想当作毕生战斗任务
    解放军驻京部队各级领导干部热情向焦裕禄同志学习
    据新华社十一日讯　人民解放军驻京部队各级领导干部，连日来一遍又一遍地阅读介绍焦裕禄同志光辉事迹的通讯。许多人在大会上、小会上，在所写的学习笔记、学习心得中，激动地表达自己的决心：要象焦裕禄同志那样，干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想，永葆革命的青春。
    最近，解放军总部、各军种兵种和北京部队团以上机关，为贯彻不久前召开的全军政治工作会议精神，正在进行整风学习。焦裕禄同志的事迹象一颗精神原子弹，立即成了进一步推动这一学习的新动力，他们有的把学习焦裕禄同志事迹列入会议日程，有的延长会议时间专门组织讨论。防化学兵三级干部会议结束了，为了学习焦裕禄同志，又把到会人员留下来，座谈了两天。各部门领导干部在学习中都带头学，带头做启发报告。总后勤部部长邱会作、某部政治委员李真在所属单位的会议上，都号召全体干部以焦裕禄为榜样，促进思想革命化和机关革命化。
    怎样才能把焦裕禄同志的革命精神学到手，许多团以上干部带着“后半辈子怎样才能更好地革命”等问题，着重学习了焦裕禄同志把学习毛泽东思想作为毕生的战斗任务，一心为革命，一心为人民。总参谋部、总政治部和空军、炮兵、工程兵、装甲兵、铁道兵、通信兵、公安部队等领导机关的干部们，在学习中，纷纷以焦裕禄同志为镜子，对照自己，找出差距。有的说：自己思想上不如焦裕禄，他心里装着全体人民，唯独没有我字，而自己还有私心杂念。有的说：工作上不如焦裕禄，焦裕禄同志是困难越大，越往上冲，自己缺乏那种冲劲。还有人找出作风上不如焦裕禄，说焦裕禄同志时时注意深入实际、调查研究，而自己对部队情况并不是这样。此外，有些人还检查自己对待群众不象焦裕禄同志那样处处与广大人民同呼吸共命运。大家认为，千差万差，归根到底是学习毛主席著作不如焦裕禄同志学得扎实，用得好。
    这几天，驻京部队的院校、医院、工厂、文艺团体和科学研究部门等，也纷纷举行座谈会、报告会、广播大会等，广泛开展了向焦裕禄同志学习的活动。解放军艺术学院全体师生停止了正课，专门进行了学习焦裕禄同志的讨论。总政治部文工团和八一电影制片厂的演员和工作人员们，在排演文艺节目期间，利用各种空隙一次又一次地学习焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹。荣获国防部授予光荣称号的“艰苦奋斗的二六一医院”的许多科室以上干部，在学习中激动地表示，要象焦裕禄同志对待贫下中农一样对待伤病员；要象焦裕禄同志领导人民改变自然面貌一样，去解决医疗技术上的难点；要象焦裕禄同志对疾病顽强斗争一样，当中国和世界革命的硬骨头。
