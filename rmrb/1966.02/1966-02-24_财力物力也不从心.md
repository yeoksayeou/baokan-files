　　Financial and Material Resources Are Also Not Up to the Task
　　He Zhuo
    American imperialism harbors the ambition of dominating the world, but its manpower and military strength, as well as its material and financial resources, are far from sufficient compared to its aggressive ambitions. A single war of aggression against Vietnam has already left it struggling to cope. The United States is increasingly feeling the strain on its supply of war materials, encountering many difficulties, and cannot but have an adverse impact on the already fragile American economy. Here are some materials from American newspapers and periodicals that provide some relevant information.
    In order to ease domestic opposition to his policy of aggression against Vietnam, Johnson has repeatedly boasted that the United States can afford the consumption on the Vietnam battlefield, saying that "production for Vietnam accounts for less than one and a half percent of our gross national product." However, the consumption of the war of aggression against Vietnam accounts for such a small proportion of the American national economy, yet it has thrown the United States into a state of disarray, making it difficult to cope. Doesn't this just expose how vulnerable the American economy is?
    Why is it that a single South Vietnamese battlefield has exhausted the United States? The reason is very simple. For more than ten years, the American ruling clique, in order to promote its counter-revolutionary global strategy of seeking world hegemony, and at the same time to ease the American economic crisis, has long implemented the militarization of the national economy. The American government spends more than 50 billion US dollars every year to maintain its huge military machine. The military production of the United States has already accounted for more than 20% of the entire industrial production. Under such circumstances, further increasing the military burden of the economy cannot but bring adverse consequences to American finance and economy.
    However, no matter how much financial and material resources the United States puts into military production, it is impossible to meet the needs of promoting its counter-revolutionary global strategy. American imperialism has spread its aggressive tentacles so widely, stationing troops and building bases all over the world. American imperialism must not only develop cutting-edge weapons to prepare for a full-scale war, but also produce conventional weapons for local wars and special wars. American imperialism must not only maintain millions of American army, navy, and air force personnel all over the world, but also supply military equipment to support puppet regimes, and also export weapons to Western European countries to support their arms expansion and war preparation. With so many tasks, all requiring a large amount of financial and material resources, it is already enough for American imperialism to bear. Now, with the addition of the war of aggression against Vietnam, an insatiable bottomless pit, how can the United States not reveal the embarrassing situation of tight supply of materials and economic imbalance?
    The impact of the war of aggression against Vietnam on the American economy is only just beginning to show some signs. As the Johnson government gradually expands the war, the weakness of the United States' lack of financial and material resources will be further aggravated. People will see more and more clearly that the American imperialism, this behemoth, is actually outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and very fragile.

　　财力物力也不从心
　　何卓
    美帝国主义怀着独霸世界的野心，但是它的人力和军力，以及物力和财力，同它的侵略野心比较起来，都是远远不足的。一场侵越战争，就已使它穷于应付了。美国在战争物资的供应上日益感到紧张，碰到了许多困难，不能不对本来就已脆弱的美国经济产生不利的影响。这里刊载几篇美国报刊的材料，多少提供了一些有关的情况。
    约翰逊为了缓和国内对他的侵越战争政策的反对，不止一次地吹嘘美国能够承担得起越南战场上的消耗。说什么“用于越南的生产，在我国国民生产总值中不到百分之一点五”。但是，侵越战争的消耗在美国国民经济中只占这么微小的比重，却把美国弄得手忙脚乱，难于应付，这不是正好暴露出美国经济是多么经不起风浪吗？
    一个南越战场就把美国拖得疲惫不堪，这是什么缘故呢？原因很简单，十多年来美国统治集团为了推行它称霸世界的反革命全球战略，同时缓和美国的经济危机，早就实行国民经济军事化。美国政府每年花费五百多亿美元来维持庞大的军事机器。美国的军事生产已在整个工业生产中占到百分之二十以上的比重。在这样的情况下，进一步增加经济的军事负担，都不能不给美国的财政经济带来恶果。
    但是，不管美国能把多少财力、物力投入军事生产，也不可能满足推行反革命全球战略的需要。美帝国主义把侵略摊子铺得那末开，在世界各地驻兵屯将、建立基地。美帝国主义既要发展尖端武器准备打全面战争，又要生产常规武器用来打局部战争和特种战争。美帝国主义既要维持遍布全球的几百万美国海陆空军，又要供应军事装备来扶植傀儡政权，还要向西欧国家输出武器支持它们扩军备战。这样千头万绪，到处都需要耗费大量财力、物力，已经够美帝国主义负担的了，现在又添上侵越战争这个填不满的无底洞，美国更怎能不显露出物资供应紧张、经济失调的窘态呢？
    侵越战争对美国经济的影响，目前还只是刚刚露出一些苗头。随着约翰逊政府逐步扩大战争，美国财力、物力不足的弱点，还将进一步严重起来。人们将会越来越清楚地看到，美帝国主义这个庞然大物，实际上是外强中干，虚弱得很的。
