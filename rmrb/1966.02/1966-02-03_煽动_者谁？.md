	Who is the "Instigator"?
	The people of Kerala, India, have launched a struggle against hunger. The Chief Minister of Kerala, Jain, actually said that this movement was "instigated."
	The people of Kerala are on the verge of starvation due to the authorities' repeated reduction of grain rations, and have been forced to rise up against the Indian government's starvation policies. As the saying goes, "oppression forces people to rebel." If the anti-hunger struggle of the Indian people was instigated, the instigator is none other than the Indian ruling authorities themselves, who are implementing the starvation policy.

    “煽动”者谁？
    印度喀拉拉邦人民群众掀起了反饥饿斗争，喀拉拉邦邦长贾殷竟说什么这次运动是有人“煽动的”。
    喀拉拉邦人民由于当局一再削减粮食配给量，濒于饿死，不得不起来反对印度政府的饥饿政策。俗话说“官逼民反”。如果说印度人民的反饥饿斗争是有人煽动的话，煽动者并非别人，而正是实行饥饿政策的印度统治当局自己。
