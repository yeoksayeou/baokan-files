　　Cutting Window Decorations
　　Chen Bingxi
　　Magpies chirp, cha-cha,
　　Sister-in-law and her husband's sister are cutting window decorations.
　　Five-colored paper in hand,
　　A window full of decorations like colorful clouds!
　　The east window is cut with the theme of learning from Dazhai,
　　Mountains obey commands, water listens to words—
　　The younger sister says: My brother is a master of reshaping mountains and harnessing rivers,
　　My sister-in-law's drive is just as great as his!
　　The west window is cut with the theme of the People's Liberation Army,
　　Honing their skills to kill the enemy—
　　The sister-in-law praises: My brother-in-law guards the border,
　　The younger sister practices martial arts just like him!
　　The sister-in-law and her husband's sister laugh heartily,
　　A big red flower is cut on the door,
　　The red flower blooms in Tiananmen Square,
　　Chairman Mao's radiance shines into our homes...
　　Snow falls, wind blows,
　　After cutting window decorations, cut door decorations,
　　Delivered to every poor and lower-middle peasant home,
　　Revolutionary flowers bloom all over the village!

    剪窗花
    陈炳熙
  花喜鹊，叫喳喳，
  姑嫂二人剪窗花，
  五色纸，手中拿，
  满窗窗花象彩霞！
  东窗剪的学大寨，
  山听指挥水听话——
  妹妹说：哥哥是改山治水手，
  嫂嫂的干劲跟他一般大！
  西窗剪的解放军，
  练好本领把敌杀——
  嫂嫂夸：妹夫守卫边疆上，
  妹妹练武正象他！
  姑嫂二人笑哈哈，
  门口剪上朵大红花，
  红花开到天安门，
  毛主席的光辉照到家……
  雪飘飘，风刮刮，
  剪罢窗花剪门花，
  贫下中农家里都送到，
  满村开遍革命花！
