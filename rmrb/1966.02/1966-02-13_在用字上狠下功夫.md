    Learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong, has become a component of the current upsurge in studying Mao Zedong Thought. An important aspect of learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu is to emulate his diligence in applying characters, just as he studied the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. Zhou Mingshan, Secretary of the Jiang County Party Committee, and other county committee comrades identified their first gap with Comrade Jiao Yulu as "not putting enough effort into applying characters." They truly grasped the crux of the problem.
    Chairman Mao's books are the supreme instruction for all our work. This is because Chairman Mao's books are universally applicable truths, the Marxist theory and method guiding the proletarian revolutionary cause to victory, and the sharpest weapon for transforming the subjective world and the objective world. Any weapon can only exert its power in the process of being used. Mao Zedong Thought generated such great power in Comrade Jiao Yulu's growth and in his work precisely because he was able to study and apply it creatively, and to put in great effort in applying characters.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us to serve the people wholeheartedly, to serve the people completely and thoroughly. Comrade Jiao Yulu acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, established a proletarian worldview, had the entire county's people in his heart, and had only no thought of himself. The word "self" or "I" could not be found in him. He devoted himself to the people and was the people's most loyal servant.
    Comrade Duan Jingyang, Deputy Secretary of the Xinmin County Party Committee, realized in his study: "If the mass viewpoint is weak and there is a lack of class feeling, it is impossible to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, and it is also impossible to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works." Comrade Duan Jingyang is right. Without deep class feelings, it is impossible to learn the theory and method of proletarian revolution, let alone use it well. We must strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, transform our subjective world, and constantly improve our ability to understand the objective world.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that to solve any problem, we must go to the masses to conduct investigation and research. If we depart from investigation to assess the political situation and guide the struggle, we will produce a subjective class assessment and a subjective work guidance. The result will be either opportunism or blind action. When Comrade Jiao Yulu arrived in Lankao County, the first thing he did was to set out on foot to conduct investigation and research among the masses. Finally, he understood and grasped the patterns of the "three evils" of waterlogging, wind and sand, and salinity, and was therefore able to lead the people of the whole county to overcome natural disasters.
    Comrade Wang Zhaoji, Deputy Secretary of the Heze County Party Committee, found the gap between himself and Comrade Jiao Yulu, examined his own work style, and realized that because he had not conducted in-depth investigation and research, he had no clear understanding of Heze's natural conditions, and only responded to droughts with drought prevention and floods with flood prevention. His work was always passive, allowing natural disasters to lead him by the nose. This problem of the Heze County Party Committee illustrates from the negative side that without conducting investigation and research, it is impossible to understand the laws of nature, and in the face of natural disasters, one will inevitably be at a loss, lose initiative, and only be at the mercy of nature.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that we must learn to look at problems comprehensively, correctly treat difficulties, acknowledge difficulties, and see achievements and brightness in times of difficulty, in order to enhance our courage. No matter how great the difficulties, as long as we rely closely on the masses, we can overcome them. Look, isn't the fearless spirit shown by Comrade Jiao Yulu in leading the people of Lankao County to fight against severe natural disasters learned from Chairman Mao's books?
    Chen Huimin, Secretary of the Dongming County Party Committee, examined that Dongming and Lankao have basically the same natural conditions. What Comrade Jiao Yulu saw in Lankao was great hope and great potential. But in the past, Dongming was seen as "everything backward, forever backward" in their eyes. They are determined to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of not fearing difficulties and to forge a path for Dongming to transform from poverty to prosperity.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Any idea, if it is not linked with objective and actual things, if there is no objectively existing need, if it is not grasped by the masses of the people, even the best things, even Marxism-Leninism, will not work."
    We study Mao Zedong Thought in order to transform the subjective world and the objective world. Whoever can use Mao Zedong Thought to solve a practical problem has achieved a portion of success; the more problems solved, the greater the achievement. Combining Mao Zedong Thought with the objective actual struggle must be achieved through the hard work and arduous labor of our party's various levels of organizations and the broad masses of cadres. The starting point and foothold of our study is that we must work hard on applying characters.
    Studying and understanding the spirit and essence of Mao Zedong Thought is not easy. Using the spirit and essence of Mao Zedong Thought to solve practical problems in revolution and construction requires even more arduous struggle. That is to say, in the process of transforming the objective world, we must constantly transform the subjective world and constantly solve problems of stance, ideology, and style. Without the determination to follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions wholeheartedly like Jiao Yulu, going through wind and rain, ice and snow, to investigate wind gaps, explore water flows, and observe quicksand, there can be no talk of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to overcome the three evils. Why are some comrades unable to go deep into the masses to conduct investigations? Why do some comrades not "squat" firmly at a point after going down, and just run around and take a look? To put it bluntly, it is because they do not feel the suffering of the masses deeply, it is because they are afraid of hardship, it is because they lack a tenacious fighting spirit, it is because they lack the revolutionary firmness of self-sacrifice, that is, the issue of their position for the people has not been thoroughly resolved. Therefore, studying Chairman Mao's books requires putting great effort into applying characters. Only through repeated and painstaking efforts, persevering through thick and thin, and persisting to the end, can it be possible to achieve the word "hard."
    Learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, we must make the greatest determination, and learn from him in studying Chairman Mao's books, putting great effort into applying characters, truly taking Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instruction for all work, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, making greater contributions to socialist revolution and socialist construction.

### 在用字上狠下功夫

    在用字上狠下功夫
    向毛泽东同志的好学生——焦裕禄同志学习，已经成为目前一个时期里，学习毛泽东思想的高潮的一个组成部分。向焦裕禄同志学习的一个重要的方面，就是要象他学习毛泽东同志著作那样，在用字上狠下功夫。绛县县委书记周明山同志和其他县委同志找到自己同焦裕禄同志的第一个差距，就是“在用字上下功夫不够”。他们真正抓住了问题的关键。
    毛主席的书是我们一切工作的最高指示。这是因为，毛主席的书，是放之四海而皆准的真理，是引导无产阶级革命事业走向胜利的马克思主义理论和方法，是用来改造主观世界和改造客观世界最锐利的武器。任何武器只有在用的过程中，才能发挥它的威力。毛泽东思想在焦裕禄同志成长过程中，在他的工作中，发生了这样巨大的力量，正是由于他能够活学活用，能够在用字上狠下功夫。
    毛泽东同志教导我们，要全心全意为人民服务，完全和彻底地为人民服务。焦裕禄同志照毛主席的指示办事，确立了无产阶级的世界观，心里装着全县人民，唯独没有自己。在他身上找不到“私”字、“我”字，他为人民鞠躬尽瘁，是人民最忠实的勤务员。
    新民县委副书记段景阳同志在学习中体会到：“如果群众观点薄弱，缺乏阶级感情，想学焦裕禄同志是学不了的，想活学活用毛主席著作也是不可能的。”段景阳同志说得很对，如果没有深厚的阶级感情，就不可能学会无产阶级革命的理论和方法，更不可能用好它。我们必须努力学习毛泽东思想，改造自己的主观世界，不断提高我们认识客观世界的能力。
    毛泽东同志教导我们，要解决任何问题，一定要到群众中去作调查研究。如果离开调查去估量政治形势，去指导斗争工作，就要产生唯心的阶级估量和唯心的工作指导，它的结果，不是机会主义就是盲动主义。焦裕禄同志到了兰考县，第一件事，就是迈开双脚，到群众中去进行调查研究，终于认识和掌握了内涝、风沙、盐碱“三害”的规律，因而能够领导全县人民战胜自然灾害。
    菏泽县委副书记王兆吉同志找出了自己同焦裕禄同志的差距，检查了自己的工作作风，认识到由于没有进行深入的调查研究，对菏泽的自然条件心中无数，旱来防旱，涝来防涝，工作总是被动，让自然灾害牵着鼻子走。菏泽县委的这个毛病，从反面说明了不进行调查研究，就不可能认识自然规律，在天灾面前，必然束手无策，丧失主动，只能听任大自然的摆布。
    毛泽东同志教导我们，必须学会全面地看问题，正确地对待困难，既要承认困难，又要在困难的时候看到成绩，看到光明，才能提高我们的勇气。不管困难多大，只要紧紧依靠群众，都是能够克服的。看，焦裕禄同志领导兰考县人民同严重自然灾害作斗争时所表现的大无畏精神，不正是从毛主席的书里学来的吗？
    东明县委书记陈惠民检查，东明同兰考自然条件基本相同。焦裕禄同志看到的兰考，是大有希望，大有可为；而过去东明在他们眼里，却是“一切落后，永远落后”。他们决心学习焦裕禄同志不怕困难的精神，为东明闯出一条由穷变富的道路来。
    毛泽东同志说：“任何思想，如果不和客观的实际的事物相联系，如果没有客观存在的需要，如果不为人民群众所掌握，即使是最好的东西，即使是马克思列宁主义，也是不起作用的。”
    我们学习毛泽东思想，是为了改造主观世界和客观世界。谁能用毛泽东思想解决一个实际问题，谁就有了一分成绩；解决的问题越多，成绩越大。把毛泽东思想同客观实际斗争相结合，要通过我们党的各级组织和广大干部的辛勤劳动和艰苦工作。我们学习的出发点和立脚点，就是必须在用字上狠下功夫。
    学习、领会毛泽东思想的精神、实质，是不容易的。运用毛泽东思想的精神、实质去解决革命、建设中的实际问题，要通过更艰苦的斗争。这就是说，要在改造客观世界的过程中，不断改造主观世界，不断解决立场、思想和作风问题。没有象焦裕禄那样全心全意按照毛泽东同志的指示办事的决心，在风里雨里、冰天雪地，去查风口，探水流，看流沙等等，就谈不到活学活用毛泽东思想去战胜三害。为什么有的同志不能深入群众，进行调查呢？为什么有的同志下去之后，“蹲”不住点，只是跑跑看看呢？说穿了，就是对群众的疾苦没有切肤之痛，就是怕艰苦，就是缺乏顽强的战斗精神，就是缺乏自我牺牲的革命坚定性，也就是为人民的立场问题没有彻底解决。因之，学习毛主席的书，必须在用字上狠下功夫。只有经过反复的刻苦的努力，百折不挠，坚持到底，才有可能做到“狠”字。
    学习焦裕禄同志，我们要下最大决心，象他学习毛主席的书那样，在用字上狠下功夫，真正把毛主席的书作为各项工作的最高指示，在毛泽东思想指导下，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。
