　　The Essence of the Spirit of "Integrity and Uprightness"
　　Zheng Wenxi
    Comrade Wu Han vigorously promotes the spirit of Hai Rui, with a prominent point being the so-called spirit of "integrity and uprightness" and "great man." What exactly is this spirit? Why does Comrade Wu Han tirelessly want us to inherit and learn from it? This is a thought-provoking question.
    "Integrity and uprightness" is a spirit highly touted by feudal scholar-officials. To understand it correctly, it must be examined in connection with the feudal ruling class itself and the historical basis that produced these ideas, in order to reveal its class essence.
    A supra-class spirit of "integrity and uprightness" and "great man" is impossible. Feudal scholar-officials were all servants raised by the feudal ruling class, and they could not exist independently of the ruling class. Hai Rui, who was praised by Comrade Wu Han as a typical example of "integrity and uprightness," served the emperor with great enthusiasm even at the age of seventy-two, despite his bumpy career. Because "the ruler is the subject's guide," "a subject must die if the ruler commands it," and "a subject must set out without delay when summoned by the ruler," have always been moral standards regarded as inviolable by feudal scholar-officials. Hai Rui's spirit of "integrity and uprightness" is closely linked to this class's moral standards.
    In general, "integrity and uprightness" is mostly used by feudal scholar-officials to praise the spirit of those who dare to remonstrate directly with the emperor and dare to fight against powerful ministers. Hai Rui is said to have possessed this characteristic. Comrade Wu Han goes to great lengths to embellish this in the play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." So, in feudal society, why did some people dare to "remonstrate directly" and "fight"?
    Under the feudal system, maintaining the feudal land ownership system and the feudal dynasty erected on the basis of this ownership was in the fundamental and long-term interests of the feudal rulers. However, the storm of peasant uprisings repeatedly struck the feudal land relations and overturned one feudal dynasty after another. In terms of maintaining feudal land ownership and the feudal state, many feudal scholar-officials who sided with the emperor shared common interests with the feudal dynasty. Many far-sighted feudal scholar-officials also felt to some extent that "the people are like water; water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it." In other words, peasants are both the object of exploitation and the source of revolutionary storms. Therefore, their exploitation of peasants had to have a limit.
    However, the cruel feudal rulers were constantly undermining their own foundations. The greed of feudal rulers was endless, which inevitably led to the increasing intensification of social class contradictions, causing concern among some scholar-officials who were closely related to the interests of the feudal dynasty. Therefore, they either remonstrated directly with the emperor, exposing some contradictions, or offered advice, attempting to turn the tide, or engaged in internal struggles to restrain the endless greed and wanton atrocities of some powerful figures. However, the common characteristic of these social quacks is that they fantasize about preserving the existing conditions of production (the feudal system) while avoiding its social consequences; they expose some secondary contradictions and phenomena; their suppression of powerful figures is like swatting flies and not tigers, in order to maintain the interests of the greatest tyrant—the feudal emperor—while suppressing the interests of other smaller tyrants. This is the class essence of their so-called "integrity and uprightness," direct remonstration, and fearlessness of powerful figures. Hai Rui's "Memorial on Governance" also reveals this secret. He made it very clear at the beginning of the "Memorial on Governance": "One can speak directly about the most important thing in the world, in order to correct the emperor's way and clarify the duties of ministers, and seek eternal peace for the world." In the memorial, he warned the Jiajing Emperor: "The officials of the world are greedy and the generals are weak, the people are not living, floods and droughts occur frequently, and bandits are rampant. This has been the case since the early years of your ascension to the throne, but it has not been very serious." When peasants rise up in revolt, "the emperor's way" and "the minister's duties" cannot be maintained. Therefore, he risked his life to submit the memorial in order to safeguard the interests of the feudal landlord class and for the "eternal peace" of the Ming Dynasty. Hai Rui's suppression of powerful figures was only in order to "establish a foundation for thousands of years in Jiangnan, repay the emperor's kindness, and repay the confidants."
    Since this kind of moral sentiment of "integrity and uprightness" fundamentally serves the interests of the feudal ruling class, the so-called "wise ruler" naturally tries his best to encourage and promote it. This is nothing more than encouraging these scholar-officials to do their best, offering advice and suggestions; on the other hand, they use these scholar-officials as tools to consolidate their rule, to expose, impeach, and punish those individual aristocratic groups that harm the statutory interests of the feudal dynasty. For example, did not Bao Zheng of the Song Dynasty, who "was upright and stern in court, causing nobles and eunuchs to restrain themselves, and all who heard of him were fearful," play this role? The ruling class also used its advocacy of the spirit of "integrity and uprightness" as opium to cover up the cruel nature of the feudal dynasty and numb the people, in order to deceive the common people into believing that they could completely "relieve" their suffering through these "honest and upright" scholar-officials and must not plot wrongdoing.
    It can be seen from this that the spirit of "integrity and uprightness" is a product of the feudal ruling class and the social relations adapted to it, and it only has an independent appearance after being processed and manufactured. In feudal society, some scholar-officials did inherit this spirit through tradition and education, and used it as the real motivation and starting point for their behavior. However, Marxists and Leninists must see through the solemn and sacred aura added by the feudal rulers and see the class essence of this spirit.
    Can this spirit of "integrity and uprightness" that serves the feudal ruling class, as Comrade Wu Han said, be transferred to today by the proletariat "to serve the politics and production of the proletariat"? It is fundamentally impossible. Lenin said: "Our morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of the proletarian class struggle. Our morality is derived from the interests of the proletarian class struggle." That is to say, the interests of the proletarian class struggle determine our fundamental attitude towards people and things. The revolutionary spirit of the proletariat is completely unrelated to the spirit of "integrity and uprightness."
    Is the spirit of "integrity and uprightness" what we need to treat class enemies? Not at all. We are filled with the greatest class hatred for class enemies at home and abroad. As Lu Xun said, "Fiercely browed, I coolly defy a thousand pointing fingers," which means that we must wage a resolute struggle against class enemies, to the point of resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminating them, and we don't need any "integrity and uprightness" at all.
    Can the spirit of "integrity and uprightness" be applied to treating the people? Not at all. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Our troops are entirely for the purpose of liberating the people, and are thoroughly working for the interests of the people." The moral character of a person is measured by whether he has the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. What is needed here is exactly what Lu Xun said, "I bow my head and willing to be an ox for the children." For the sake of the people, one can go through life and death, not fear difficulties, and not be afraid of sacrifice, and there is no question of "integrity and uprightness" at all.
    Can the spirit of "integrity and uprightness" be transferred to handling relationships between comrades? It is also fundamentally impossible. Comrades in our revolutionary ranks have come together for a common revolutionary goal. We must help each other and strengthen unity on the basis of revolutionary principles. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "All people in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, cherish each other, and help each other." Even when dealing with the shortcomings and mistakes of comrades, we start from the desire for unity and resolve the contradictions through criticism or struggle, thereby achieving new unity on a new basis. How incompatible is the so-called spirit of "integrity and uprightness" with the attitude of revolutionaries.
    Can the spirit of "integrity and uprightness" still be used to treat the leadership of the Party and all revolutionary organizations? Completely impossible. The Communist Party has no special interests of its own. The interests of the Party are completely consistent with the interests of the proletariat and the interests of the complete liberation of all mankind. This determines that our Party has three major work styles: the work style of linking theory with practice, the work style of maintaining close ties with the masses, and the work style of criticism and self-criticism. In the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat, due to various subjective and objective reasons, there may indeed be shortcomings and errors of one kind or another. However, "Because we serve the people, we do not fear criticism from anyone, no matter who he may be. Anyone may point out our shortcomings. If he is right, we will correct them." If it is said that such a Party that serves the people wholeheartedly and is completely selfless still needs the spirit of "integrity and uprightness" of feudal scholar-officials, is that not an absurd idea?
    Within our Party and various revolutionary organizations, there is still the relationship between leaders and those being led. In handling the relationship between leaders and those being led, and between superiors and subordinates, there is no need for the spirit of "integrity and uprightness." Within the Party and revolutionary organizations, the relationship between people is a completely equal, mutually supportive, and cooperative comrade relationship. The division between leaders and those being led, and between superiors and subordinates, is only due to the different divisions of revolutionary labor, and this relationship is completely based on the principle of democratic centralism. Communists and revolutionaries handle this relationship based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, the principles of the Party, and the principles of revolution. In their minds, only the interests of the Party, the interests of the revolution, and the interests of the people are above all else, and they always maintain the firm stand of the proletariat. What do all these revolutionary virtues have in common with the "integrity and uprightness" of feudal scholar-officials?
    It can be seen that the spirit of "integrity and uprightness" as a feudal moral norm is incompatible with today's socialist society and cannot be transferred to today at all. Otherwise, it is either ignorance of socialist society or the use of feudalism to oppose socialism.

### “刚直不阿”精神的实质

　　“刚直不阿”精神的实质
　　郑文希
    吴晗同志大肆宣扬的海瑞精神，其中突出的一点即所谓“刚直不阿”、“大丈夫”精神。这究竟是什么样的精神呢？吴晗同志为什么不厌其烦地要我们加以继承和学习呢？这是一个发人深思的问题。
    “刚直不阿”，是封建士大夫十分吹捧的一种精神，为了正确了解它，就必须同封建统治阶级本身，以及产生这些思想的历史基础联系起来考察，才能揭露其阶级实质。
    超阶级的“刚直不阿”、“大丈夫”精神，是不可能存在的。封建士大夫都是封建统治阶级所豢养的臣仆，他们不可能离开统治阶级而独立存在。被吴晗同志吹捧为“刚直不阿”的典型的海瑞，为了替皇帝效劳，尽管宦途坎坷，已经七十二岁了，还劲头十足地应诏到南京做官。因为，“君为臣纲”，“君命臣死，臣不敢不死”，“君命召不俟驾而行”，从来就是封建士大夫奉为天经地义的道德准则。海瑞的“刚直不阿”精神，正是同这种阶级的道德准则紧密相联的。
    在一般情况下，“刚直不阿”多是封建士大夫用来赞美那些敢于犯颜直谏、敢于同权臣斗争的人物的精神。海瑞据说就具有这种性格。吴晗同志在《海瑞罢官》一剧中更极尽其渲染之能事。那么，在封建社会里，为什么有一些人敢于“直谏”和“斗争”呢？
    在封建制度下，保持封建土地占有制以及耸立在这种占有制基础上的封建王朝，这是封建统治者的根本利益和长远利益所在。但是，农民起义的风暴，一再打击了封建土地关系，倾覆了一个接一个的封建王朝。在保持封建土地占有制和封建国家方面，许多投靠皇帝的封建士大夫同封建皇朝有着共同的利益。许多有远见的封建士大夫也多少感觉到，“民犹水也，水能载舟，也能覆舟”，换句话说，农民是剥削的对象，也是革命风暴的源泉。因此，他们对农民的剥削不得不有一个限度。
    但是，残暴的封建统治者，又在不断挖自己的墙脚。封建统治者的贪欲是无止境的，这就必然造成社会阶级矛盾日益激化，而引起同封建皇朝利益休戚相关的一部分士大夫的忧心。因此，他们或者犯颜直谏，揭露一些矛盾，或者出谋划策，妄图挽狂澜于既倒，或者进行几场内部斗争，抑制一些豪强的无穷贪婪和肆意暴行。但是，这些社会庸医的共同特点是，幻想保存现有的生产条件（封建制度），而避免它的社会后果；揭露一些次要矛盾和现象，他们的抑制豪强，是打苍蝇不打老虎，为了维护最大的豪强——封建皇帝的利益，而抑制其他小豪强的利益。这就是他们所谓的“刚直不阿”、犯颜直谏、不避权贵的阶级本质。海瑞的《治安疏》也道出了这个秘密。他在《治安疏》的开头就说得很清楚：“可直言天下第一事，以正君道明臣职，求万世治安事。”他在疏中向嘉靖皇帝警告说：“天下吏贪将弱、民不聊生，水旱靡时，盗贼滋炽，自阶下登极初年，亦有之而未甚也。”农民起来暴动了，“君道”、“臣职”都保不住了。所以他是为了维护封建地主阶级的利益，为了明皇朝的“万世治安”，而冒死上疏的。海瑞的抑制豪强不过是为了在“江南立千百年基业，酬上恩报知己”。
    这类“刚直不阿”的道德情操，既然从根本上是维护封建统治阶级利益的，那末，所谓“圣君”自然就极力加以鼓励和提倡。这无非是一方面鼓励这些士大夫为他们鞠躬尽瘁，出谋献计；另一方面又把这些士大夫作为巩固自己统治的工具，用来揭发、弹劾和惩治那些危害封建皇朝法定利益的个别贵族集团。例如，宋朝包拯“立朝刚肃、贵戚宦官为之敛手，闻者皆惮之”②，不就是起了这个作用吗？统治阶级还把
  自己提倡“刚直不阿”精神，作为掩饰封建皇朝凶残本相、麻醉人民的鸦片，以欺骗老百姓相信完全可以通过这些“刚直不阿”的士大夫，来“解除”自己的苦痛，千万不可图谋不轨。
    由此可见，“刚直不阿”精神是封建统治阶级以及和它相适应的社会关系的产物，只是经过加工制造，便具有一幅独立化的外表而已。在封建社会中，有些士大夫确实通过传统和教育承受了这种精神，并以此作为他们的行为的真实动机和出发点。但是，马克思列宁主义者就必须透过封建统治者加上的庄严的圣洁的光圈，看到这种精神的阶级实质。
    这种为封建统治阶级服务的“刚直不阿”精神，可以象吴晗同志所说的，被无产阶级移用于今天，“使之为无产阶级的政治、生产服务”吗？根本不能。列宁说过：“我们的道德完全服从无产阶级阶级斗争的利益。我们的道德是从无产阶级阶级斗争的利益中引伸出来的。”③这就是说，无产阶级阶级斗争的利益，决定了我们对人对事的根本态度。无产阶级的革命精神是同“刚直不阿”精神毫不相干的。
    “刚直不阿”的精神是我们对待阶级敌人所需要的吗？根本不是。我们对于国内外的阶级敌人，充满了最大的阶级仇恨。鲁迅说得好：“横眉冷对千夫指”，就是说的对于阶级敌人要同他们作坚决斗争，以至坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭他们，根本不需要什么“刚直不阿”。
    “刚直不阿”的精神能够移用于对待人民吗？根本不能。毛泽东同志教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”④衡量一个人的道德面貌就看他是否具有全心全意为人民服务的精神，这里所需要的正是鲁迅所说的“俯首甘为孺子牛”。为了人民，可以出生入死、不畏困难、不怕牺牲，根本谈不上什么“刚直不阿”。
      “刚直不阿”的精神能够移用来处理同志关系吗？也根本不能。我们革命队伍中的同志是为着一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来的。我们必须在革命原则的基础上互相帮助，加强团结。毛泽东同志说：“一切革命队伍的人，都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”⑤就是对待同志的缺点和错误，我们也是从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争使矛盾得到解决，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结。所谓“刚直不阿”的精神，同革命者的态度是多么格格不入。
      “刚直不阿”的精神还能够用来对待党的领导和一切革命组织吗？完全不能。共产党没有自身的特殊利益，党的利益同无产阶级的利益、全人类彻底解放的利益是完全一致的。这就决定了我们党具有三大优良作风：理论联系实际的作风，同人民群众密切联系的作风，以及批评和自我批评的作风。在无产阶级的革命斗争中，由于主客观的各种原因，有时的确也会产生这样或那样的缺点和错误。但是，“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”⑥对待这样全心全意为人民服务、大公无私的党，如果说还需要封建士大夫的“刚直不阿”精神，那岂不是奇谈怪论吗？
    在我们党内和各种革命组织内部，还存在领导同被领导的关系。在处理领导同被领导、上级同下级之间的关系上，也不需要什么“刚直不阿”的精神。在党内和革命组织内部，人同人的关系是完全平等的互助合作的同志关系。所以有领导同被领导、上级同下级之分，只是由于革命分工的不同，而且这种关系是完全建立在民主集中制原则的基础之上的。共产党员和革命者是根据马克思列宁主义的原则、党的原则、革命的原则来处理这种关系的。在他们的心目中，只能是党的利益、革命的利益和人民的利益高于一切，始终保持无产阶级的坚定立场。这一切革命美德，同封建士大夫的“刚直不阿”有什么共同之点呢？
    可见，作为封建道德规范的“刚直不阿”精神同今天的社会主义社会是格格不入的，根本不能移用于今天。否则，不是对社会主义社会无知，就是要用封建主义来反对社会主义。
