    Arm Our Minds with Mao Zedong Thought, Make a Big Fuss about Technical Innovation for the Revolution
    Report by Comrade Huang Rongchang, Technical Innovation Vanguard, Worker Engineer, and Deputy Chief Engineer of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company (Summary)
    Editor's Note: What do technical innovation and technical revolution rely on? They rely on the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the practice of the broad masses. Comrade Huang Rongchang's speech fully illustrates this point.
    Technical innovation and technical revolution, in our country, are movements in which the broad masses constantly explore the unknown realms of production technology. What is the main direction of attack in this movement at a certain period? What should be done when encountering difficulties? How to continuously develop and continuously improve? All of these need to be analyzed and guided by Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought commands everything, and the development of science and technology is no exception.
    Any new technology is the product of mass practice. Without the practice of the broad masses, new technologies cannot be developed quickly, well, and economically. Here, the role of scientific and technological experts is very important. However, they can only fully play their role if they closely integrate with the broad masses, constantly summarize the practical experience of the masses, and constantly engage in creative labor.
    Comrade Huang Rongchang was an ordinary carpenter with rich practical experience. After becoming the deputy chief engineer, he continued to live, work, and innovate with the workers. In practice, he creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, constantly creating and inventing, and achieved ninety-seven technical innovations in more than ten years. The path taken by Comrade Huang Rongchang is the common path of scientific and technical personnel of the working class.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: Huang Rongchang, a representative of national industrial and transportation advanced figures, a technical innovation vanguard, a worker engineer, and deputy chief engineer of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, made a report at the enlarged meeting of the National Industrial and Transportation Work Conference and the National Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference on the 17th. The title of the report was "Arm Our Minds with Mao Zedong Thought, Make a Big Fuss about Technical Innovation for the Revolution," a summary of which is as follows:
    Before liberation, I was a poor carpenter, an illiterate. After liberation, under the kind teaching and cultivation of the Party and Chairman Mao, I gradually understood the principles of revolution and learned a little culture and scientific and technological knowledge. For more than ten years, according to the Party's instructions, I have been engaged in technical innovation with the masses in my own labor post, learning while doing, doing while learning, from ignorance to understanding, from simple to complex, and have successively succeeded in ninety-seven innovation projects, improving and creating more than 230 sets of machinery and equipment. Although these equipments are native-born, a combination of local and foreign methods, they have realized the mechanization of loading, unloading and transportation of woodworking workshops, wharfs, and material yards, and the partial mechanization of masons and stonemasons, freeing some class brothers from heavy physical labor, and saving some construction funds for the country.
    All inventions and creations are created by the working people in the struggle for production and scientific experiments, and are not conjured out of the brains of a natural inventor.
    What force has driven me to constantly create and move forward in technical innovation? It is Mao Zedong Thought, it is the Party's continuous education and cultivation, it is the class hatred firmly kept in mind.
    I was born in a poor peasant family in Dianjiang County, Sichuan. My mother fled famine for the first time and gave birth to me on the road, calling me "Luer" (Road Child). My mother fled famine for the second time and died on the road. My father was tortured to death by capitalists. My younger brother was given away, and my elder sister fled famine to Guizhou. At the age of eleven and a half, I went to a carving shop as an apprentice, and later wandered to Chongqing as a street carpenter. I worked in the "beauty decoration" (i.e., model people in department store windows) in the Chongqing Yingsheng Construction Factory. The capitalists forced me to work day and night, and life was unbearable.
    After liberation, we poor people saw the blue sky, no longer suffered exploitation and oppression, our work was guaranteed, and we had no worries about food and clothing. In order to repay the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao, I desperately wanted to do more work. However, the tools we used at that time were all passed down from our ancestors. We worked so hard all day that our backs ached, but we couldn't produce much, which really made people feel anxious. I thought, how great it would be if we could build machines to work! However, some people saw that we were ordinary carpenters, who couldn't recognize a few words, and wanted to build machines, saying that the weasel wanted to eat swan meat.
    When I attended the first session of the First National People's Congress, I saw Chairman Mao, which gave me endless strength. I personally heard Chairman Mao say in his opening speech: "We are doing an extremely glorious and great undertaking that our predecessors have never done before." I kept every word of the Chairman firmly in my heart and resolved to do it according to the Chairman's teachings. Later, I studied some of Chairman Mao's works and further understood that the working class and all working people are the most intelligent, most capable, and most creative, and that all inventions and creations are created by the working people in the struggle for production and scientific experiments, and are not conjured out of the brains of a natural inventor. Chairman's instructions greatly boosted the ambition of our workers.
    When I realized that technical innovation was for the revolution, I thought that we workers should not only see the tip of our noses, not only see our own small units, but should have the country in our hearts and the world in our eyes while in the workshop. If the revolution is to be carried through to the end, we must look further ahead. We took the initiative to find things to do, to compete for things to do. Before one innovation was completed, we thought of the second innovation. Wherever there was heavy physical labor, wherever there was a production bottleneck, we took the initiative to ask the organization to assign the most urgent and difficult tasks to ourselves.
    The Party Committee transferred me out of the carpentry workshop and set up a mechanized assault team, which later developed into a mechanized workshop, specializing in fighting battles of mechanization. Wherever there was heavy physical labor, we went there; wherever there were production bottlenecks and weak links, we went there. After realizing woodworking mechanization, we also made stone cutting machines and large hammer-type stone opening machines for stonemasons, as well as mortar mixing machines for masons, bridge-type, scissor-type, turntable-type and other various cranes for wharfs and material yards, as well as overhead monorail transportation lines and rotating loading and unloading bridges, steel plate cold shearing machine single-machine movable control consoles for steel rolling production, hot-installed vertical molten iron ladle cars for steelmaking production, etc.; At the same time, we also made some mechanized and semi-mechanized equipment for people's communes, and some grain processing mechanical equipment for commercial departments.
    There is an ideological struggle between engaging in technical innovation for personal fame and profit and engaging in technical innovation for the revolution among us. Once, our workshop succeeded in a technical innovation that saved 8,000 yuan, and someone filled out an application form requesting a bonus of 200 yuan. I felt very sad when I learned about this. I thought of the revolutionary martyrs shedding blood and sacrificing themselves for the cause of communism. Do we have to haggle over personal interests when we have done a little bit for the country! For this matter, we all studied "Serve the People" again, so that everyone understood that our technical innovation is to engage in revolution, not for money, not for fame, but to wholeheartedly serve the people and shoulder heavy burdens for the Party. By doing so, everyone's enthusiasm was even greater. This incident made me realize that in the past, we only grasped innovation and didn't care about people's hearts, so we didn't work together wholeheartedly; now we grasp innovation, first care about people's hearts, so we work vigorously and in unison.
    Start from reality, dare to think and dare to do, dare to create; don't be trapped by "foreign frameworks," don't walk with "foreign crutches"
    In technical innovation, whether to start from reality, dare to think and dare to do, dare to create, or to be trapped by "foreign frameworks" and rely on "foreign crutches" is also full of contradictions and struggles among us. I am an ordinary worker. I have never seen many foreign things. I only know that the Party instructs us to do what to do, and the production needs us to do what to do. However, some people, when they mention technical innovation, want to find ready-made things. They dare not do what is not in the books, they dare not do what is not in the country, and they dare not do what has no precedent in foreign countries. Some of them are not very interested in the creations of our workers, thinking that there is no theoretical basis. I remember when I was improving the sawing machine in the carpentry workshop, a technician asked me to draw a design drawing. At that time, I couldn't even write my own name, so how could I draw a drawing? It really made me so anxious that I couldn't eat or sleep. Later, I spent more than ten nights drawing a rough sketch. The technician took a look and just shook his head, put it in the drawer, as if a stone had sunk into the sea, and didn't pop up for half a year. We were anxious, so we did it ourselves. After working for dozens of days in a row, we finally successfully transformed the sawing machine.
    On March 28, 1958, our beloved leader Chairman Mao came to Chongqing Iron and Steel. He saw the porters carrying steel plates onto the ship in the large rolling workshop. Thirty-six people carried one plate, shouting slogans and walking step by step, which was very laborious. He said with concern, can we make some small-scale mechanized transportation? I was very moved when I heard this, thinking, how concerned Chairman Mao is about the workers! I must do it according to Chairman Mao's instructions, I must make mechanized transportation a success, and realize Chairman Mao's instructions. The company's Party committee decided to set up a mechanized assault team to realize Chairman Mao's instructions and transferred me to be the leader. At that time, I had only been in the carpentry workshop for a short time, and I didn't understand much about mechanical technology theory. I didn't know how to do it. I also heard people say sarcastically: "Huang Rongchang is a carpenter, I can trust him to do woodworking mechanization; if he can make this complicated transportation mechanization, I will fry fish for him on the palm of my hand." Mechanizing this wharf was indeed difficult: the terrain was complex, the rise and fall of the river water was large, the difference between dry water and flood water was dozens of meters, and the tide mud after the flood was two or three meters deep. No suitable sample for this wharf could be found in the books. In the face of these difficulties, when we thought of Chairman Mao's instructions, we were a hundred times more courageous and determined to make it a success, and we had to worry about it. I thought, Chairman Mao is our guide, and his teachings are the source of our strength. We must consider objective conditions, but the first thing to consider is our subjective thinking, whether it conforms to Mao Zedong Thought. Don't let foreign books tie up our hands and feet.
    In order to strengthen everyone's confidence and enthusiasm, we concentrated three days to study "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," to establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, and to overcome various fears and difficulties. We finally got inspiration from the structural principle of the Yangtze River Bridge and came up with a "bridge-type crane" plan. The characteristic of this plan is that a bridge-type crane equipment can move up and down with the rise and fall of the river water, ensuring that it can be close to the cargo ship at any time. However, some engineering technicians said that our plan was not scientific, there was no data basis in the books, and there was no precedent in our country. I said: "The things in the books are created by the working people, they didn't fall from the sky; now there is nothing in the books, we created it, and there will be something in the books in the future." Everyone said: "Regardless of whether it is in his books or not, let's do it first." We designed, manufactured, and installed it ourselves. A large-scale loading and unloading crane equipment without any theoretical basis in books was born in the hands of a group of ordinary workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought.
    Dare to make revolution, dare to create, but never be reckless. Do it boldly if you are sure, try it if you are not sure
    Our working class dares to make revolution, dares to create, but is never reckless. We do things according to Chairman Mao's teachings, combining soaring revolutionary enthusiasm with a realistic and scientific attitude. Do it boldly if you are sure, try it if you are not sure. Every time we make a machine, we conduct on-the-spot investigations and research, put forward one plan after another, even dozens of plans, repeatedly ponder, repeatedly think, and repeatedly experiment. It is often a process of experimenting, failing, experimenting again, failing again, until success. We made earthen cannons and succeeded after eleven failures. The cold shearing machine single-machine movable control console was modified nine times before it was completely suitable. More than fifty plans were proposed for the bridge-type crane.
    We try our best to unite with engineering technicians. I think their scientific and theoretical knowledge is very rich. As long as they can do things according to Chairman Mao's instructions, are not restricted by "foreign frameworks," and combine with the workers, they will definitely be able to constantly make innovations and creations.
    Take the road of self-reliance, take the road of hard struggle, take the road of more, faster, better, and more economical results, take the road of "poor sticks" making revolution
    Chairman Mao taught us to "save every copper plate for the cause of war and revolution, for our economic construction." Chairman Mao's important instruction is the principle that we can never forget when engaging in technical innovation. Our working class is to do things according to Chairman Mao's instructions, take the road of self-reliance, take the road of hard struggle, take the road of more, faster, better, and more economical results, and take the road of "poor sticks" making revolution.
    Using molten iron from the blast furnace to directly make steel is a problem that the First Steelmaking Workshop has long urgently requested to be solved. The original plan was to build a special railway, buy special equipment, invest 1.6 million yuan, start construction after 1967, and also demolish some factory buildings and equipment. In February 1965, the leadership assigned this task to us. We repeatedly studied with the comrades of the First Steelmaking Workshop, and finally used an old slag car to transform it into a vertical molten iron ladle car, using the existing ordinary railway and spending only 19,000 yuan and more than 20 days, we realized the "drinking chicken soup" (i.e., using molten iron from the blast furnace to directly make steel) that the workers of the First Steelmaking Workshop had been looking forward to for a long time, saving the country more than 800,000 yuan every year.
    We often encounter difficulties in the lack of materials when engaging in technical innovation. We make friends with scrap iron piles, picking up everything from a small screw to a large gear, and piling it up in a room. Everyone calls it the "treasure house." This "treasure house" can not only be used for many things in small innovations, but also plays a significant role in large innovations.
    Another difficulty is the technical barrier. In our mechanized workshop, many people are apprentices and ordinary workers, and the highest technical level is only three or four. What to do? Still take the road of self-reliance. I took the lead and studied hard with everyone, learning whatever we needed, and seeking teachers and friends everywhere. In this way, we learned the technology bit by bit. We can process and assemble some bushings, center shafts, gears, etc. that require high precision. I also basically mastered the operating techniques of lathe, fitter, electrician, and riveter from a carpenter who only knew how to use axes and planes, and later actually learned design, drawing, etc.
    Our mechanized workshop was also built from scratch. At first, there was only a four-walled, ventilated room, two desks, four light bulbs, and two old vises. Some people said that doing mechanization like this is a joke, like children "playing house" (holding a banquet). Others said to me: "Chongqing Iron and Steel has a large family fortune. It is no problem for you, Huang Rongchang, an old model worker, to ask for some equipment. You can't make a name for yourself with these broken things. People will laugh at you!" I thought, self-reliance and hard work are Chairman Mao's teachings, and making revolution means working hard and working hard. If you only look at the problem from a small unit, you will want to ask the higher authorities for more and more things. If you look at the problem from the whole country, from the 650 million people, then you should ask the higher authorities for less and less things. So we made our own processing equipment, and the leadership and brother units gave us great support, and gradually equipped the mechanized workshop.
    Of all things, reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and doing things

    用毛泽东思想武装头脑  为革命大闹技术革新
    技术革新闯将、工人工程师重庆钢铁公司副总工程师黄荣昌同志的报告（摘要）
    编者按：技术革新技术革命靠什么？靠毛泽东思想的指导，靠广大群众的实践。黄荣昌同志的讲话，充分说明了这一点。
    技术革新和技术革命，在我们国家，是广大群众不断探索生产技术未知领域的运动。这个运动在一定时期的主攻方向是什么？遇到困难怎么办？如何不断发展、不断提高？都需要用毛泽东思想分析和指导。毛泽东思想统帅一切，发展科学技术也不例外。
    任何新的技术，都是群众实践的产物。没有广大群众的实践，就不能多快好省地发展新技术。在这里，科学技术专家的作用是很重要的。可是，他们只有同广大群众密切结合，不断总结群众的实践经验，不断进行创造性的劳动，才能充分发挥他们的作用。
    黄荣昌同志是一个普通木工，有着丰富的实践经验；当了副总工程师以后，继续坚持同工人一起生活，一起劳动，一起革新；在实践中活学活用毛主席著作，不断有所创造，有所发明，在十几年中，实现九十七项技术革新。黄荣昌同志走过的道路，就是工人阶级科学技术人员的共同道路。
    据新华社十九日讯　全国工业交通先进人物代表、技术革新闯将、工人工程师、重庆钢铁公司副总工程师黄荣昌十七日在全国工业交通工作会议、全国工业交通政治工作会议扩大会议上作了报告。报告题目是《用毛泽东思想武装头脑为革命大闹技术革新》，摘要如下：
    解放前，我是个穷木匠，是个文盲。解放后，在党和毛主席的亲切教导和培养下，我逐渐懂得了革命的道理，学到了一点文化和科学技术知识。十多年来，根据党的指示，我在自己的劳动岗位上，和群众一道搞技术革新，边学边干、边干边学、从不懂到懂、从简易到复杂，先后搞成功了九十七种革新项目，共改进和创造了二百三十多台机器设备。这些设备虽然是土生土长的、土洋结合的，但已使木工车间和码头、料场的装卸运输实现了机械化，使泥工、石工实现了部分机械化，解除了一些阶级弟兄的笨重体力劳动，为国家节约了一些建设资金。
    一切发明创造都是劳动人民在生产斗争和科学实验中创造出来的，不是那一个天生的发明家的脑袋瓜里凭空想出来的
    是什么力量推动我在技术革新中不断有所创造，有所前进呢？是毛泽东思想，是党的不断教育和培养，是阶级仇恨牢记在心。
    我出身在四川垫江县的一个贫农家庭，母亲第一次逃荒，在路上生了我，把我叫“路儿”。母亲第二次逃荒，在路上拖死了，父亲是被资本家折磨死的，弟弟送了人，姐姐逃荒去贵州。我十一岁半就进雕花铺当学徒，后来流浪到重庆当过街木匠，在重庆营生营造厂做“美人装”（就是百货商店橱窗里的模型人），资本家逼着我不分昼夜地干，生活无法过下去。
    解放后，我们穷人见了青天，不再受剥削压迫，工作有了保障，不愁穿不愁吃。为了报答党和毛主席的恩情，我拼命想多干活。但是我们当时使用的工具，都是老辈传下来的，一天干得腰酸背疼，也出不了多少活，真叫人心里毛焦火辣的。我就想，要是能够造出机器来干活多好啊！但是，有的人看到我们是普通木工，认不到几个字，也要造机器，说是黄鼠狼想吃天鹅肉。
    我参加第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的时候，见到了毛主席，这给我增添了无穷无尽的力量。我亲自听到毛主席在开幕词中说：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”主席每一句话，我都牢牢记在心里，决心按照主席的教导去干。后来，我又学了些主席的著作，进一步懂得了工人阶级和一切劳动人民才是最聪明最有才能最能创造的，一切发明创造都是劳动人民在生产斗争和科学实验中创造出来的，不是那一个天生的发明家的脑袋瓜里凭空想出来的。主席的指示，大大长了我们工人的志气。
    当我认识到为革命搞技术革新的时候，我就想，我们工人阶级不能只看到鼻子尖尖上的事，不能只看到自己那个小单位，应当是人在车间，心怀祖国，放眼世界。革命要进行到底，就得把眼光放远些。我们就主动地找事干，争事干，一项革新没有完，心里又想到了第二项革新。看到那里有笨重体力劳动，那里有生产关键上不去，就主动要求组织上把最迫切最困难的任务分配给自己干。
    党委把我调出了木工房，成立了一个机械化突击小组，以后发展成为机械化车间，专门找机械化的仗打，那里有笨重的体力劳动就到那里去干，那里有生产关键和薄弱环节就到那里去干。我们在实现了木工机械化之后，又为石工搞了切石机、大锤式开石机，还有泥工的拌灰机，码头、料场的桥梁式、剪刀式、转盘式等各种起重机，以及架空单轨列车运输线和旋转装卸桥，轧钢生产用的钢板冷剪机单机活动操纵台，炼钢生产用的热装立式铁水罐车等；同时还为人民公社搞了一些机械化和半机械化的设备，为商业部门搞了一些粮食加工机械设备。
    为个人名利搞技术革新，还是为革命搞技术革新，在我们中间是有思想斗争的。有一次，我们车间搞成了一项技术革新，节约了八千元，就有人填了一个申请表，要求发给两百元奖金。我知道这件事情后，心里很难过。想起了革命先烈为实现共产主义事业流血牺牲，难道我们为国家做了一点点事情，就要斤斤计较个人利益吗！为了这件事，我们大家又学习了《为人民服务》，使每个人懂得，我们搞技术革新就是干革命，一不为钱，二不为名，要全心全意为人民，为党争挑重担。这样做，大家的干劲更大了。这件事情使我认识到：过去光抓革新，不管人心，干起活来不齐心；现在抓革新，先管人心，干起活来雷厉风行一条心。
    从实际出发，敢想敢干，敢于创造；不要被“洋框框”套住，不要靠“洋拐棍”走路
    在技术革新中，从实际出发，敢想敢干，敢于创造，还是被“洋框框”套住，靠“洋拐棍”走路，在我们中间也是充满着矛盾和斗争的。我是个普通工人，许多洋东西都没有见过，只知道党指示我们搞什么就搞什么，生产上需要我们搞什么就搞什么。但是，有的人一提到技术革新，就想找现成的东西，书本上没有的他们不敢搞，国内没有的他们不敢搞，外国没有先例的他们更不敢搞。他们中间有些人，对我们工人群众的创造很不感兴趣，认为没有理论根据。记得在木工房搞改进锯木机时，有个技术员叫我画设计图，当时我连自己的名字都写不起，怎么画图呢？硬是急得我吃不下饭，睡不着觉。后来我花了十几个晚上才画了一个草图。技术员一看，直是摆脑壳，拿去压在抽屉里，好象石沉大海，半年都不冒个泡。我们着急了，就自己动手干。一连干了几十天，终于把锯木机改造成功了。
    一九五八年三月二十八日，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席来到了重钢，他在大轧车间看见搬运工人抬钢板上船，三十六个人抬一块，吼起号子一步一步走，很费劲。他很关切地说，可不可以搞些小型运输机械化呢？我听了这句话很受感动，心想，毛主席他老人家对工人多关怀啊！我一定要按毛主席的嘱咐去做，一定要搞成机械化运输，实现毛主席的指示。公司党委决定成立一个机械化突击小组来实现毛主席的指示，调我去作组长。当时我刚走上木工房不久，机械技术理论也懂得不多，究竟该如何搞法，心中还没有底。又听到人家说风凉话：“黄荣昌是木匠，搞木工机械化我信得过；要是他能把这复杂的运输机械化搞得出来，我就手板心头煎鱼给他吃。”这个码头搞机械化确实有困难：地形复杂，江水涨落变动大，枯水与洪水之间相差几十米，洪水后的潮泥达两、三米深，在书本上找不到适合这个码头的样本。在这些困难面前，我们一想到毛主席的嘱咐，就勇气百倍，立志非把它搞成功不可，非操这份心不可。我想，毛主席是我们的引路人，他的教导就是我们的力量的源泉。我们要考虑客观条件，但首先要考虑的是我们的主观思想，合不合毛泽东思想。不要被洋本本把自己的手脚捆绑起来了。
    为了坚定大家的信心和干劲，我们集中了三天的时间来学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，克服各种各样的畏难情绪。我们终于从长江大桥的结构原理上得到了启发，搞出了一个“桥梁式起重机”的方案。这个方案的特点是，一个桥梁式的起重设备，可以随着江水起落而上下移，保证随时都可与货船靠拢。但是，有的工程技术人员说我们的方案不科学，书上没有资料依据，我国也没有先例。我说：“书本上的东西都是劳动人民创造出来的，不是从天上掉下来的；现在书本上没有，我们创造出来了，将来书本上就有了。”大家都说：“不管他的书本上有没有，我们干起来再说。”我们自己设计，自己制造，自己安装。一台没有书本理论依据的大型装卸起重设备，就在一群用毛泽东思想武装起来的普通工人手中诞生了。
    敢于革命，敢于创造，但决不是蛮干。有把握的就大胆干，没有把握的就试试看
    我们工人阶级敢于革命，敢于创造，但决不是蛮干。我们是按毛主席的教导办事的，以冲天的革命干劲和实事求是的科学态度相结合。有把握的就大胆干，没有把握的就试试看。我们每搞一部机器，都要进行实地的调查研究，提出一个又一个方案，甚至几十个方案，反复琢磨，反复思考，反复试验。往往是经过试验，失败，再试验，再失败，直到成功的过程。我们搞土泥炮，经过十一次失败后才成功。冷剪机单机活动操纵台先后修改过九次才完全合用。桥梁式起重机先后共提出过五十多个方案。
    对工程技术人员，我们尽量团结他们。我想，他们的科学理论知识很丰富，只要能按照毛主席的指示办事，不受“洋框框”的限制，和工人相结合，就一定能不断搞出革新创造来。
    走自力更生的路，走艰苦奋斗的路，走多快好省的路，走“穷棒子”闹革命的路
    毛主席教导我们要“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设”。毛主席的这个重要指示，是我们搞技术革新永远不能忘记的原则。我们工人阶级就是要按照毛主席的指示去办，走自力更生的路，走艰苦奋斗的路，走多快好省的路，走“穷棒子”闹革命的路。
    用高炉铁水直接炼钢，是第一炼钢车间长期来迫切要求解决的问题。原计划要修专用铁路，买专用设备，投资一百六十万元，到一九六七年以后动工，还要拆掉一些厂房和设备。一九六五年二月，领导上把这项任务交给了我们。我们与第一炼钢车间的同志一道，反复研究，最后采用了一部旧渣车来改造成为立式铁水罐车，利用现有的普通铁路只花了一万九千元，用了二十多天的时间，就实现了第一炼钢车间工人早日盼望的“喝鸡汤”（即高炉铁水直接炼钢）的要求，每年可为国家节省八十多万元。
    我们搞技术革新，经常遇到材料缺乏的困难。我们跟废铁堆交朋友，小至一颗螺丝钉，大至一个牙包，都拣回来，堆满了一间屋子。大家叫它“百宝库”。这个“百宝库”，不但小革新中许多东西能用得上，就是搞大的革新，也发挥不少作用。
    另一个困难是技术关。我们机械化车间，许多人是学工、普工，最高的技术也只有三、四级。怎么办？还是走自力更生的道路。我首先带头，与大家一道苦学苦钻，需要什么就学什么，到处寻师访友。就这样，我们一点一滴地学到了技术，一些精密要求较高的布司、中心轴、齿轮等，都能自己加工装配了。我也从一个只会用斧子、刨子的木匠，基本上掌握了车、钳、电、铆等操作技术，以后又在实际上学会了设计、绘图等。
    我们机械化车间也是白手兴家搞起来的。起初，只有一间四壁通风的房子，两张办公桌，四个电灯泡，两把旧虎钳。有人说，这样子搞机械化是开玩笑，象小孩子“办家家酒”（办酒席）。还有人向我说：“重钢家底大，你黄荣昌是个老劳动模范，要点设备是不成问题的。靠这些破烂的东西，搞不出什么名堂来，别人要笑话！”我想，自力更生，艰苦奋斗是毛主席的教导，干革命就是要穷干、苦干嘛。只从一个小单位看问题，就会想向上级要东西要得越多越好，如果从全国来看问题，从六亿五千万人民来看问题，那应当是向上级要东西要得越少越好。于是我们自己动手造加工设备，领导上和兄弟单位又给了我们大力支持，逐步把机械化车间装备起来。
    千条万条，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事是第一条
    十几年来，不管党把我安在什么工作岗位上，我都坚持和工人一起生活，一起劳动，一起革新。一九六○年，我从外面开会回来，车间的工人向我说：“老黄，你现在是公司的副总工程师了，有通知要你搬到办公大楼去上班，咱们要分手了！”我心想，我是劳动人民出身，在劳动中成长，离开劳动，我什么也干不出来，什么也干不好。我向大家说：“你们放心，我决不离开大家。”现在，我象过去一样，天天和工人群众滚在一起，只有开会和研究工作的时候才到公司办公大楼去。
    十几年来，我深刻体会到，要搞革命，千条万条，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事是第一条。有了毛泽东思想，在战场上能打胜仗，在生产上能打胜仗，在技术革新上同样能打胜仗。不管干什么工作，不用毛泽东思想来指导，就干不好，就要犯错误。毛主席的著作句句都是宝，学了毛主席著作，大风大浪不动摇，什么困难吓不倒。这些年来，我们搞的每一项革新，凡是搞成的，都是按毛主席的指示去做的结果。我带着工人阶级的深厚感情学习毛主席著作，有三个不忘、三个永远、三颗红心：
    三个不忘是：（一）不忘党和毛主席的恩情，（二）不忘阶级苦，永记阶级仇，不忘阶级斗争，（三）不忘世界上还有三分之二的劳动人民没有解放，一定要把革命进行到底。
