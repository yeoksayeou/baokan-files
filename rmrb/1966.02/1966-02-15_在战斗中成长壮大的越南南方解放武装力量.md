    The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces Growing Stronger in Combat
    February 15, 1961, is the unification day of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces.
    On December 20, 1960, the South Vietnam National Liberation Front was proclaimed. In order to meet the needs of the revolutionary situation and further defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, on February 15, 1961, the South Vietnam National Liberation Front unified the people's armed units in various regions to form the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces. Since then, the South Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation entered a new stage of centralized leadership and unified organization. Over the past five years, the Liberation Armed Forces have inflicted increasingly heavy blows on the U.S. aggressors and the South Vietnamese puppet army on various battlefields in South Vietnam, fundamentally changing the situation in South Vietnam in a short period of time.
    The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces were born and grew strong in the raging flames of the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. In 1954, U.S. imperialism invaded South Vietnam, fostered a puppet regime, and carried out the most barbaric and cruel bloody suppression and massacre of the South Vietnamese people. For freedom, liberation, and the unification of the motherland, the heroic South Vietnamese people took up arms one after another and embarked on the road of armed struggle.
    Starting in 1959, the people in various parts of South Vietnam organized self-defense forces, using rudimentary weapons such as sticks, bamboo spears, bows and arrows, and homemade guns to launch armed struggles against the enemy. In that year, the enemy shot and killed three patriots in Tra Bong, western Guangyi Province. The local people, unable to endure it any longer, rose up and killed nine enemies, seizing the enemy's weapons for the first time. Another people's self-defense team captured an enemy stronghold in Ben Tre Province barehanded, also seizing weapons from the enemy. At the same time, a South Vietnamese people's armed propaganda team disguised themselves and infiltrated an enemy barracks, capturing enemy firearms and arming themselves. These armed self-defense organizations were the forerunners of the South Vietnam Liberation Army.
    The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces are an army of the people, a revolutionary army, and have received the active support of the broad masses of the people. In the struggle against the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, this people's armed force has grown from nothing to something, from weak to strong, becoming stronger as it fights, and constantly growing and expanding. Initially, they were only a small team with rudimentary weapons such as broadswords, spears, bows and arrows, and homemade guns, and were at a disadvantage in terms of both quantity and equipment. However, harboring a deep-seated hatred for the national enemy, they carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, applied the strategy and tactics of people's war, and under the slogans of "fight with whatever weapons you have," "combine simple, self-made weapons with modern weapons," and "seize the enemy's weapons to eliminate the enemy," they were resourceful and flexible, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, launching guerrilla warfare everywhere, and effectively eliminating the enemy's vital forces.
    Starting with the Bac Son battle in 1963, the Liberation Armed Forces were generally able to annihilate an entire enemy company in one battle, and in a few cases, an entire battalion. By 1964, the Liberation Army's activities had expanded from mountainous and jungle areas to densely populated, river-crossed, heavily guarded plains and near transportation lines, forming a favorable situation of the countryside surrounding the cities. In one battle, they were able to cleanly and neatly annihilate an enemy main force battalion. By 1965, the victory of completely annihilating one to two battalions of the enemy's main force in one battle was quite common. Now, the Liberation Armed Forces are not only able to eliminate puppet troops in entire battalions and regiments, but also to eliminate U.S. aggressor troops in battalions. The so-called "elite" and "ace" units boasted by the U.S. aggressors have been beaten to a pulp by the Liberation Armed Forces and are in a state of utter disarray. The Liberation Armed Forces continue to seize the enemy's weapons to equip themselves. As more and more enemies are annihilated, their equipment is also gradually improving. The Associated Press had to admit in a report on November 10, 1965: "The Communists have shown that they have as many or even more submachine guns as the American soldiers, and also have a large amount of ammunition to maintain a long period of combat."
    Over the past five years, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have grown into a powerful and invincible force consisting of main force troops, local troops, and militia. They have given full play to the infinite power of people's war, severely attacked the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, and achieved unparalleled brilliant victories, making the enemy tremble with fear. Even Taylor, the defeated general of the South Vietnamese people, was forced to admit that the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces are "a very formidable enemy."

    在战斗中成长壮大的越南南方解放武装力量
    一九六一年二月十五日是越南南方解放武装力量统一日。
    一九六○年十二月二十日，越南南方民族解放阵线宣告成立。为了适应革命形势的需要和进一步击败美帝国主义及其走狗，一九六一年二月十五日，越南南方民族解放阵线把各地的人民武装单位统一组成越南南方解放武装力量。从此，越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争进入了一个领导集中、组织统一的新阶段。五年来，解放武装力量在南越各战场，给予美国侵略者和南越伪军以日益沉重的打击，使南越的形势在短短的时期内就起了根本的变化。
    南越解放武装力量是在抗美救国斗争烈火中诞生和成长壮大的。一九五四年，美帝国主义侵入越南南方，扶植傀儡政权，对南越人民进行了最野蛮残酷的血腥镇压和屠杀。为了自由、解放和统一祖国，英勇的南越人民纷纷拿起武器，走上武装斗争的道路。
    一九五九年开始，南越各地人民纷纷组织自卫队，用棍棒、竹矛、弓箭和土枪等简陋武器，向敌人展开了武装斗争。这一年，敌人在广义省西部的茶蓬枪杀了三名爱国者，当地人民忍无可忍，揭竿而起，打死了九名敌人，第一次夺得了敌人的武器；另一支人民自卫队赤手空拳地攻占了槟椥省敌人的一个据点，也从敌人手中夺得了武器。同时，一支南越人民武装宣传队伪装潜入敌人的一个兵营，缴获了敌人枪支，武装了自己。这些武装自卫组织就是南越解放军的前身。
    南越解放武装力量是一支人民的军队、革命的军队，受到广大人民群众的积极拥护和支持。在反对美国侵略者及其走狗的斗争中，这支人民武装力量从无到有，从弱到强，越战越强，不断成长和壮大。起初，他们只是一支人数不多，手执大刀、长矛、弓箭、土枪等简陋武器的队伍，无论在数量和装备上，都处于劣势。但是，他们怀着对民族敌人的刻骨仇恨，发扬了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，运用了人民战争的战略战术，在“有什么武器打什么仗”，“简单、自造武器与现代化武器相结合”，“夺取敌人武器消灭敌人”的口号下，机智灵活，神出鬼没，到处展开游击战争，有效地消灭敌人的有生力量。
    从一九六三年的北村战斗开始，解放武装力量在一次战役中，一般能消灭敌人一个整连，在少数情况下能歼灭一个整营。到一九六四年，解放军的活动从山区和丛林地带扩展到人口稠密、河网交叉、有敌人重兵把守的平原地区和交通线附近，形成了农村包围城市的有利形势。一次战役能够干净、利落地歼灭敌人一个主力营。到了一九六五年，在一次战役中全歼敌军主力部队一个营到两个营的胜利已经相当普遍。现在，解放武装力量不仅能够整营、整团地消灭伪军，而且也能成营地消灭美国侵略军。美国侵略者吹嘘的所谓“精锐”、“王牌”部队，都被解放武装力量打得落花流水，狼狈不堪。解放武装力量不断夺取敌人的武器装备自己。由于歼灭的敌人越来越多，他们的装备也越来越有所改善。美联社一九六五年十一月十日在一篇报道中不得不承认：“共产党人显示出有和美军士兵数量相等甚至更多的冲锋枪，也有能维持一个长时期作战的大量弹药。”
    五年来，南越解放武装力量已经成长壮大为一支包括主力部队、地方部队和民兵的强大的、不可战胜的力量。他们充分发挥人民战争的无穷威力，沉重地打击了美国侵略者及其走狗，取得了无比辉煌的胜利，使敌人胆战心惊。连南越人民手下的败将泰勒也被迫承认：南越解放武装力量是“一个非常厉害的敌人”。
