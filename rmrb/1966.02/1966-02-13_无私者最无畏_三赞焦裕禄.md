    The selfless are the Most Fearless
    Three Praises for Jiao Yulu
  　Yu Ming
    Another spiritual atomic bomb has exploded.
    These past few days, people have been reading the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong, with excitement, again and again. They use him as a mirror to examine themselves, use him as a model to find their shortcomings, and are determined to sweep away the dust in their minds, to emulate him, to learn from him.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu is a person of great fearlessness. From his example, we see once again that true Marxists are fearless.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu came to the disaster-stricken Lankao County with a serious illness, facing yellow sand, sunken lands, ice ridges, saline-alkali soil, and withered grass. However, he was not overwhelmed by the difficulties. Just as Chairman Mao taught: "When our comrades are in difficulty, they must see the achievements, see the light, and increase our courage." Comrade Jiao Yulu saw a future green forest from the sand dunes, saw that a patch of white alkaline land could be turned into a patch of green, and saw that the waterlogged depressions could be used for planting reeds, cattails, and raising fish. He regarded this disaster area as a place where much could be done, and he saw the benefits of the disaster area: it could temper people's revolutionary will and cultivate people's revolutionary character.
    The title of an article Comrade Jiao Yulu was preparing to write before his death was "The People of Lankao Have Lofty Aspirations, Daring to Teach the Sun and Moon to Change to a New Sky." Comrade Jiao Yulu himself was a revolutionary with "lofty aspirations." His ambition is indeed something that those who only calculate personal gains cannot understand.
    Where lies the key to seeing a bright future in the face of difficulties? It lies in the revolutionary transformation of the leader's thinking. If the leader only thinks of his own pain and ignores the suffering of the masses, he cannot brave the wind and sand to investigate wind gaps and explore quicksand, he cannot chase the flow of water in a vast expanse of water, he cannot visit old poor peasants when heavy snow seals the doors, and he cannot see the light in the midst of difficulties, nor can he establish confidence in overcoming difficulties.
    Only the selfless can be fearless. The people of Daqing say: "The farther away from 'me' by an inch, the more energy added by one point; the farther away from 'me' by a foot, the more energy rises without limit; if the word 'me' is completely forgotten, one can climb knife mountains and plunge into seas of fire." Comrade Jiao Yulu was able to fill his heart with Mao Zedong Thought, filled with the cause of the Party, the cause of the people, and wholeheartedly engage in revolution precisely because he completely disregarded personal gains and losses. Therefore, he has the greatest courage. As long as a person can be as selfless as Comrade Jiao Yulu, he will be able to see the power of Mao Zedong Thought, see the power of the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly rely on the Party and the masses. What difficulties in the world cannot be overcome?
    The revolutionary Chinese people are a fearless people. Chairman Mao said long ago, "The Chinese are not afraid of death, so what are they afraid of?" Heaven is not to be feared, earth is not to be feared, demons and monsters are not to be feared, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements are not to be feared, imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries are not to be feared, famine is not to be feared, war is not to be feared, and atomic bombs are not to be feared. In the eyes of revolutionary people, these things are all paper tigers, all of which can be fought and defeated. "We must sweep away all pests, leaving no enemy." We have Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful weapon, we will overwhelm all enemies and all difficulties, and never be overwhelmed by enemies and difficulties.
    The last subheading of Comrade Jiao Yulu's article is: "Spiritual Atomic Bomb – Spirit Becomes Matter." Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit has already turned into a material force that transforms the world in Lankao. In the upsurge of cadres throughout the Party learning Mao Zedong Thought, Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds are a new driving force. We will see the chain reaction of this spiritual atomic bomb, and more Jiao Yulu-style cadres will inevitably emerge.

    无私者最无畏
    三赞焦裕禄
  　余铭
    又一颗精神原子弹爆炸了。
    这几天，人们以激动的心情，一遍又一遍地读着毛泽东同志的好学生——焦裕禄同志的事迹，以他做镜子，对照自己，以他做榜样，找差距，决心打扫自己思想上的灰尘，向他看齐，向他学习。
    焦裕禄同志是一个大无畏的人。从他的身上，我们再一次看到，真正的马克思主义者是无所畏惧的。
    焦裕禄同志带着重病来到重灾的兰考县，面对的是黄沙、洼窝、冰凌、盐碱、枯草。然而，他没有被困难压倒。正象毛主席所教导的：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”焦裕禄同志从沙丘看到了将来的一片绿林，从碱地的一片白看到可以变成一片青，从涝洼窝看到可以栽苇、种蒲、养鱼。他把这个灾区看成是大有作为的地方，他看到了灾区的好处：可以锻炼人的革命意志，培养人的革命品格。
    焦裕禄同志临终前准备写的一篇文章题目叫做《兰考人民多奇志，敢教日月换新天》，焦裕禄同志自己就是一个“多奇志”的革命者。他的这种志向，的确不是那些只会打个人小算盘的人所能理解的。
    要从困难中看到光明的前途，关键在哪里呢？在于领导者的思想革命化。如果领导者只想到自己的病痛，看不到群众的疾苦，他就不可能顶着风沙去查风口、探流沙，就不可能在一片汪洋中去追水的流向，就不可能在大雪封门的时候去访问老贫农，也就不可能在困难中见到光明，也就不可能树立战胜困难的信心。
    无私者才能无畏。大庆人说：“离‘我’远一寸，干劲添一分；离‘我’远一丈，干劲无限涨；‘我’字若全忘，刀山火海也能上。”焦裕禄同志正是把个人的得失完全置于度外，他的心里才能装满了毛泽东思想，装满了党的事业，人民的事业，全心全意去革命，所以，他就有最大的勇敢。一个人只要能象焦裕禄同志那样忘我，他就能够看到毛泽东思想的威力，看到用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众的威力，坚定地依靠党，依靠群众，还有什么人世间的困难不能克服呢？
    革命的中国人民，是大无畏的人民。毛主席早就说过，“中国人死都不怕，还怕困难么？”天不可怕，地不可怕，牛鬼蛇神不可怕，地富反坏不可怕，帝国主义、修正主义、反动派不可怕，灾荒不可怕，战争不可怕，原子弹不可怕；在革命的人民看来，这些东西统统是纸老虎，都是可以战而胜之的。“要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌。”我们有毛泽东思想这个最强大的武器，我们要压倒一切敌人，一切困难，而决不被敌人和困难所压倒。
    焦裕禄同志写的文章的最后一个小标题是：“精神原子弹——精神变物质”。焦裕禄同志的革命精神已经在兰考变成了改天换地的物质力量。在全党的干部开展学习毛泽东思想的高潮中，焦裕禄同志的事迹是一个新的推动力量，我们将会看到这颗精神原子弹的连锁反应，更多的焦裕禄式的干部必然会涌现出来。
