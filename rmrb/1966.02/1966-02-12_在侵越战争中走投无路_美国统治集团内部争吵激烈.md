    Desperate in the War of Aggression Against Vietnam
    Internal Disputes Intensify Within the US Ruling Clique
    The disputes within the US ruling clique surrounding the issue of salvaging the defeat in the War of Aggression Against Vietnam have recently become very intense and public.
    A Din Inside and Outside Congress
    As soon as Congress reconvened this year, a group of Democratic senators, led by Senator Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a leading figure in the Democratic Party, seized the opportunity of the Committee's review of Johnson's request for additional funds for the invasion of Vietnam to launch a frontal attack on the Johnson administration's Vietnam policy. They accused the government of "misrepresenting the situation" to Congress and demanded that the government publicly clarify its exact policies. Secretary of State Rusk and others were summoned to testify and were subjected to what *Newsweek* called "the most intense public questioning the government has ever undergone." Senators Gruening and Morse even threatened to propose repealing the joint resolution passed by both houses in August 1964, granting Johnson special powers to wage a war of aggression in Southeast Asia, and even deprive the president of the power to send new troops to Southeast Asia. Some Republicans in both houses also advocated open debate. Outside of Congress, many senior political figures and influential figures in the press also expressed disagreement with the Johnson administration's policies. For a time, opinions varied, and the din was constant, plunging Washington into chaos.
    "Hold Fast" or "Expand"?
    The main argument against the Johnson administration's current policy is that expanding the war is too costly and risks a large-scale war in Southeast Asia that would be detrimental to the United States. Representative of this is the proposal by retired General Gavin, who believes that the United States should hold fast to Saigon and coastal strongholds, preserve the strength of the US military, and seek other ways out. According to US newspapers, this is "the first fundamental criticism of the government by a military man of standing." Gavin's views were supported by political figures such as Fulbright, Ridgway, Kennan, and a number of influential bourgeois newspapers. However, another faction advocated accelerating the expansion of the war, even at the risk of a major war.
    In addition to the question of what to do next in South Vietnam, there were also differences of opinion on whether to resume the bombing of North Vietnam. In late January, 76 Democratic members of the House of Representatives and 15 Democratic senators jointly submitted petitions to Johnson opposing the US resumption of bombing of North Vietnam. They argued that bombing North Vietnam had proven ineffective both diplomatically and militarily, and instead put the United States at a political disadvantage, while the cessation of bombing could play a certain deceptive role. Another faction, however, advocated continuing the bombing and even expanding the scope of the bombing.
    Same Starting Point
    In this great debate, despite the quite intense disputes, these different opinions all proceed from the standpoint of safeguarding the US imperialist counter-revolutionary global strategy, only with different emphases and means. The faction advocating expanding the war is worried that failure in Vietnam will lead to a major collapse of the aggressive front, and therefore advocates making a big bet in Vietnam, taking risks, sparing no expense, and seeking a military solution. The faction advocating "holding fast," on the other hand, is worried that getting bogged down too deeply in Vietnam will leave the United States unable to cope with the revolutionary situation in the vast areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and will lead to the collapse of the US counter-revolutionary global strategy. Therefore, they advocate stabilizing the situation in South Vietnam and seeking a solution favorable to the United States by other means.
    Longstanding Disputes, More Intense Now
    Disputes within the US ruling clique over the Vietnam issue have a long history. Since January of last year, there have been three debates surrounding the War of Aggression Against Vietnam. However, this great debate is more intense and more superficial than previous debates. Many people have publicly criticized the military and political strategy pursued by Johnson to date, and Fulbright and others have even questioned the basis of Johnson's power to wage this war. The fact that so many members of Johnson's own party openly oppose the government's policies cannot be said to be an unusual phenomenon.
    The reason why this abnormal phenomenon has occurred within the US ruling clique, and such a large-scale debate has taken place on their fundamental policies, is the result of the serious failure of the War of Aggression Against Vietnam and the serious difficulties faced by the United States.
    Johnson accelerated the "gradual escalation" of the War of Aggression Against Vietnam, and constantly poured large numbers of US troops into South Vietnam. As a result, it did not save the US aggressors from defeat in South Vietnam, but instead became deeply mired in the quagmire, and reached a dead end. As the casualty lists increased rapidly, the conscription figures continued to expand, and military expenditures increased sharply, the movement of the American people against the War of Aggression Against Vietnam developed vigorously. At the same time, the United States became increasingly isolated internationally and unable to improve. It is precisely in this state of exhaustion that some people in the Washington ruling clique cannot but worry that if they continue to follow Johnson's policies, the US global strategy will collapse entirely, and they have proposed solutions that they believe are more clever. Opinions differ among the factions, contradictions intensify, and they openly show their cards and launch this great debate.
    Honolulu Conference Deepens Contradictions
    The recent Honolulu Conference shows that the Johnson administration will continue to gradually escalate and expand the war in Vietnam. This will inevitably cause the US aggressors to become more and more deeply mired in the quagmire, and the situation will become more and more embarrassing. The contradictions within the US ruling clique will also continue to intensify, and the disputes will continue to develop further. Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union and former Chairman of the State Department Policy Planning Committee, Kennan, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 10th, expressing his opposition to the Johnson administration's "escalation" of the War of Aggression Against Vietnam, fearing that the result of doing so would "almost certainly" involve the United States in a military conflict with China. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright said to Kennan that, according to the results of the Honolulu Conference, it seemed to him that "we have further undertaken obligations." He said, "This makes me very, very uneasy when I read the joint declaration we signed." Kennan agreed with Fulbright's view.
    US columnist Lippmann also published an article in the *New York Herald Tribune* on February 9, criticizing the US government's policy of expanding the War of Aggression Against Vietnam, in response to Johnson's speech in Honolulu. He accused Johnson of "losing sight of the new knowledge of the current world."
    However, neither the expansionist faction nor the so-called "hold fast" faction are willing to abandon the policy of aggression against Vietnam. Therefore, no matter which faction's approach is followed, the United States cannot get out of its predicament, and the expansionist adventure can only accelerate the final defeat.

### 在侵越战争中走投无路  美国统治集团内部争吵激烈

    在侵越战争中走投无路
    美国统治集团内部争吵激烈
    美国统治集团内部围绕着挽救侵越战争败局问题进行的争吵，最近变得十分激烈而且公开化。
    国会内外一片吵嚷
    今年国会刚刚复会，以参院外交委员会主席、民主党头面人物富布赖特为首，一批民主党的参议员就利用外委会审议约翰逊追加侵越费用要求的机会，对约翰逊政府的侵越政策发动正面抨击，指责政府向国会“错误地传达情况”，要求政府公开阐明确切的政策。国务卿腊斯克等被召作证，受到了《新闻周刊》称之为“政府曾经受到过的最紧张的公开盘问”。格伦宁和莫尔斯两个参议员甚至扬言要提议废止一九六四年八月通过的授予约翰逊在东南亚进行侵略战争的特别权力的两院联合决议，甚至剥夺总统把新兵派到东南亚去的权力。两院的一些共和党人也主张进行公开辩论。在国会以外，很多政界高级人士和新闻界有影响人物，也对约翰逊政府的政策表示异议。一时意见纷纭，吵嚷不休，华盛顿陷于一片混乱。
    “固守”还是“扩大”
    反对约翰逊政府现行政策的主要论点，是认为扩大战争代价太高，而且要冒在东南亚进行一场对美国不利的大战的危险。这方面有代表性的是退伍将军加文的主张，他认为美国应当固守西贡和沿海据点，保存美军有生力量，同时寻求其它出路。按美国报刊的说法，这是“第一个有地位的军人向政府提出根本性的批评。”加文的意见，得到了富布赖特、李奇微、凯南等政界人士和一部分有影响的资产阶级报刊的支持。但是，另一派人则主张加速扩大战争，甚至不惜冒一场大战的危险。
    除了在南越下一步怎么办这个问题以外，对于是否恢复轰炸越南北方的问题也出现过分歧意见。一月下旬，七十六名民主党众议员和十五名民主党参议员分别联名向约翰逊提出请愿书，反对美国恢复轰炸越南北方。他们认为轰炸越南北方在外交上、军事上都已证明是无效的，反而使美国在政治上陷于被动，而停止轰炸却能起一定的欺骗作用。而另外一派人却主张要继续轰炸，甚至扩大轰炸范围。
    出发点却是一致的
    在这场大辩论中，尽管争吵颇为激烈，但是这些不同的意见都是以维护美帝国主义反革命全球战略出发的，只是侧重点和手段有所不同而已。主张扩大战争的一派担心在越南的失败将招致侵略阵线的大崩溃，因此主张在越南下大赌注，甘冒风险，不惜代价，谋求军事解决。主张“固守”的一派则担心在越南越陷越深，会使美国无力应付亚非拉广大地区的革命形势，使美国的反革命全球战略垮台，因而主张在南越稳住阵脚，用其它手段求得有利于美国的解决。
    争吵已久于今为烈
    美国统治集团内部就侵越问题发生争吵，由来已久。从去年一月开始，围绕着侵越战争已经先后进行了三次辩论。但是，这一次大辩论比起以往几次辩论来，更为激烈、更为表面化。有不少人对约翰逊迄今执行的军事和政治战略提出公开的责难，富布赖特等人甚至对约翰逊进行这场战争的权力根据提出质疑。在约翰逊自己党内那么多的议员公开反对政府政策，这不能不说是一种脱出常轨的现象。
    美国统治集团内部之所以会发生这种异常现象，就它们根本性的政策公开进行如此大规模的争吵，这是侵越战争遭到严重失败，美国处境陷入严重困难的结果。
    约翰逊加速把侵越战争“逐步升级”，不断把大量美军投入南越，结果并没有挽回美国侵略者在南越的败局，反而深陷泥淖，走投无路。随着伤亡名单迅速增加，征兵数字不断扩大，军费开支急剧增加，美国人民反对侵越战争的运动蓬勃发展。同时美国在国际上也日形孤立，无法改善。正是在这种黔驴技穷的窘态中，华盛顿统治集团中的一部分人不能不担忧，如果按约翰逊的政策继续搞下去会使美国的全球战略整个垮台，就提出了自以为比较高明的办法来。各派之间意见不一，矛盾加剧，就公开摊牌，展开了这场大辩论。
    檀香山会议加深矛盾
    最近檀香山会议表明，约翰逊政府还要继续在越南逐步升级，扩大战争。这就必然会使美国侵略者在泥淖里越陷越深，处境越来越狼狈，美国统治集团内部的矛盾也将继续加剧，争吵还会进一步发展。美国前驻苏大使、前国务院政策计划委员会主席凯南十日在参院外交委员会作证时，表示反对约翰逊政府所奉行的使侵越战争“升级”的作法，担心这样作的结果“几乎肯定”会使美国卷入一场同中国的军事冲突后，参院外委会主席富布赖特对凯南说，根据檀香山会议的结果，据他看来，“我们进一步承担了义务”。他说，“这使我在读我们签字的联合宣言时非常非常不安。”凯南表示同意富布赖特的看法。
    美国专栏作家李普曼二月九日也在《纽约先驱论坛报》上发表文章，针对约翰逊在檀香山的讲话，对美国政府扩大侵越战争的政策提出批评，他指责约翰逊“丢掉了当前世界的新知识”。
    但是，不论扩大战争派也好，或者是所谓“固守”派也好，他们都决不愿放弃对越南的侵略政策。因此，不论按照那一派的做法，美国都不能摆脱困境，扩大战争冒险更只能加速最后失败。
