    The Blood Debt Owed by the American Bandits Must Be Repaid
    Senior Colonel He Wenlou Protests the Barbaric Crime of American Aircraft Bombing Schools
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi – Senior Colonel He Wenlou, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, sent an urgent telegram to Rahman, Chairman of the International Commission for Vietnam, on the 10th, strongly protesting and denouncing the towering crime of American aircraft's crazy bombing and strafing of residential areas and schools in Huong Khe District, Ha Tinh Province, on the 9th, killing and wounding 57 elementary school students and eight residents.
    The telegram pointed out that this incident of killing many students and residents in Huong Phuc Commune School, Huong Khe District, is another extremely inhuman crime committed by the American aggressors against the Vietnamese people. This kind of war action by American imperialism further exposes the despicable rhetoric of "humanitarianism" and "peace" that the American authorities are constantly clamoring about.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi – Vietnamese newspapers published commentaries on the 11th, angrily condemning the barbaric crime of American bandit aircraft bombing Huong Phuc School in Huong Khe District, Ha Tinh Province, North Vietnam, on the 9th, killing and wounding 57 students.
    The *People's Daily*'s commentary stated that this is an extremely barbaric crime newly committed by American imperialism. The commentary said that the bloody crimes of American imperialism can only make the flames of hatred of the Vietnamese people burn even more fiercely. We deeply remember this irreconcilable hatred and are determined to fight even harder and give the American aggressors the punishment they deserve.
    The *People's Army Daily*'s commentary said that after American imperialism boasted about its "humanitarianism" and "sincerity" in "seeking peace" for a while, it continued its heinous bombing. This crime of the American bandits not only cannot threaten our people, but instead exposes its murderous face.
    The commentary said that our entire army and people must hold our guns tightly, aim at the enemy, and avenge the victimized children! We are determined to make the American bandits repay the blood debt!

    美国强盗欠下的血债一定要偿还
    何文楼大校抗议美机轰炸学校的野蛮罪行
    新华社河内电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校，十日打紧急电报给越南国际委员会主席拉赫曼，强烈抗议和控诉美国飞机九日疯狂轰炸扫射河静省香溪县的居民区和学校，炸死炸伤五十七名小学生和八名居民的滔天罪行。
    电报指出，这次杀害香溪县香福乡学校许多学生和居民的事件，是美国侵略者对越南人民犯下的又一件极端惨无人道的罪行。美帝国主义的这种战争行动更加揭穿了美国当局喋喋不休地叫嚷的所谓“人道”和“和平”的卑鄙论调。
    据新华社河内电　越南各报十一日发表评论，愤怒谴责美国强盗飞机九日轰炸越南北方河静省香溪县香福学校、炸死炸伤五十七名学生的野蛮罪行。
    《人民报》的评论说，这是美帝国主义新犯下的一桩极其野蛮的罪行。评论说，美帝国主义的血腥罪行只能使越南人民仇恨的火焰烧得更旺。我们深深地记着这些不共戴天的仇恨，决心要打得更狠，给美国侵略者以应有的惩罚。
    《人民军队报》的评论说，美帝国主义吹嘘了一阵“人道”和“谋求和平”的“诚意”之后，又继续进行罪恶的轰炸。美国强盗的这种罪恶，不仅威胁不了我国人民，反而揭穿了它的杀人犯的面目。
    评论说，我们全军全民要握紧枪杆，瞄准敌人，为受害的儿童们报仇！我们决心要美国强盗偿还血债！
