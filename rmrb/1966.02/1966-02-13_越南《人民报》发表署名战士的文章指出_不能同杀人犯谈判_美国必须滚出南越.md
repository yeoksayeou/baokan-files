    The People's Daily Publishes Article Signed by a Soldier:
    Cannot Negotiate with Murderers; the United States Must Get Out of South Vietnam
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 12th) The Vietnamese newspaper *People's Daily* published an article signed by a soldier on February 12th, stating that one cannot negotiate with murderers and that the only way to end the Vietnam War is for the American aggressors to get out of South Vietnam.
    The article, titled "The United States Has Failed Again," stated that on January 31st, the American bandits' bombs were once again dropped on North Vietnam, tearing apart President Johnson's ugly mask and causing the United States to suffer another major political defeat.
    The article stated that the United States' loud cries of "suspending the bombing of North Vietnam" and launching the so-called "peace offensive" cannot deceive world opinion, nor can it deceive the American people.
    The article pointed out that the United States' promotion of "unconditional discussions" is actually conditional, and that condition is that Vietnam surrender.
    The article stated that for five years, all of the United States' strategic plans have been buried in Vietnam. Faced with the powerful forces of the Vietnamese people's war, even with millions of tons of modern weapons and hundreds of thousands of expeditionary troops, the United States cannot change the situation according to its wishes. On the contrary, the Vietnamese people's armed forces always maintain the initiative in their own hands. The United States' new strategic plans have suffered the same fate as the old ones.
    The article pointed out that the United States hypocritically pretends to support the 1954 Geneva Accords. In fact, it has already rudely violated this agreement.
    The article said that the U.S. government spews forth wild nonsense, attempting to make the American people believe that North Vietnam is invading and commanding the war in the South. Therefore, the United States never recognizes the right of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front to participate in negotiations. The article emphasized, "What is there to negotiate? One cannot negotiate with murderers; their hands must be tied. The policy of American imperialism is a policy of murder; it is unreasonable and impossible to negotiate. The only way to end the war is for the United States to get out of South Vietnam!"

    越南《人民报》发表署名战士的文章指出
    不能同杀人犯谈判　美国必须滚出南越
    新华社河内十二日电　越南《人民报》十二日发表署名战士的文章指出，不能同杀人犯谈判，结束越南战争的唯一途径是：美国侵略者必须从越南南方滚出去。
    这篇题为《美国又失败了》的文章说，一月三十一日，美国强盗的炸弹又投到越南北方，撕碎了约翰逊总统的丑恶面具，使美国在政治上又遭到一次大失败。
    文章说，美国大肆叫嚷“暂停轰炸北越”和发动所谓“和平攻势”，欺骗不了世界舆论，也欺骗不了美国人民。
    文章指出，美国宣扬“无条件讨论”，其实是有条件的，那就是要越南投降。
    文章说，五年来，美国的一切战略计划都在越南被埋葬。面对着越南人民战争的强大力量，尽管美国有成百万吨现代化武器和几十万远征军，也不能按照它的意图改变局势。相反，越南人民的武装力量时刻把主动权掌握在手里。美国新的战略计划象旧计划一样遭到了失败。
    文章指出，美国假惺惺地装出支持一九五四年日内瓦协议的样子。事实上，它已经粗暴地破坏了这个协议。
    文章说，美国政府放肆地胡说八道，妄图使美国人民相信：越南北方侵略和指挥南方的战争。因此，美国从不承认越南南方民族解放阵线有权参加谈判。文章强调指出，“谈判什么呢？不能同杀人犯谈判，必须把它的手绑起来。美帝国主义的政策是杀人的政策，它是毫无道理的，也是不可能谈判的。结束战争的唯一途径是，美国必须从越南南方滚出去！”
