    Editor's Note: How to master the Daqing experience? Comrades from some industrial enterprises in the Northwest region said at a symposium organized by our reporter: "Whether an enterprise learns well from Daqing depends on whether the revolutionization of the leading cadres is sufficient." This is an experienced view.
    Daqing is a model of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought on the industrial front, a model of learning and applying the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army, and a model of implementing the general line of socialist construction. The Daqing experience is not just about one aspect of industrial construction, but a directional experience of running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought and taking China's own path. In this sense, without hard work and effort, it is impossible to master the Daqing experience.
    However, the Daqing experience is not unattainable. The most essential aspect of the Daqing experience is to creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, taking class struggle and the struggle between the two roads as the key link to promote the revolutionization of people, especially the revolutionization of leading cadres. If we grasp this core and work diligently, "one thing understood, everything is understood." The Daqing experience can be learned, and Daqing can be caught up with and even surpassed.
    Now, learning from Daqing is becoming the slogan of action for all enterprises. Many Daqing-type enterprises have already emerged across the country, and more Daqing-type enterprises will appear. The situation is pressing, and it is not only the enterprises that are being "forced" to change, but also the leading organs that lead the enterprises. The revolutionization of leading organs is necessary to lead the revolutionization of enterprises. This is something that the leading organs of all enterprises should seriously consider.
    We hope that comrades from industrial enterprises and enterprise leading organs in various regions will discuss their experiences and express their opinions on the question of "how to master the Daqing experience."

    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, February 7th) "The most important aspect of learning from Daqing is to learn the core of the Daqing experience—the revolutionization of people; whether an enterprise learns well from Daqing depends on whether the revolutionization of the leading cadres is sufficient." This is the opinion put forward by comrades from some enterprises in the Northwest region at a symposium organized by our reporter. More than a dozen leading cadres and workers from industrial and mining enterprises in five provinces and regions in the Northwest attended the symposium.

    Without Revolutionary Spirit, the Daqing Experience Cannot Be Learned

    The comrades who spoke unanimously believed that the Daqing experience fully embodies the spirit of Mao Zedong Thought and the general line of socialist construction, and is a model of running enterprises with Mao Zedong Thought and taking our own path. The core of the Daqing experience is the revolutionization of people, emphasizing politics, and arming the minds of workers and staff with Mao Zedong Thought. The most important thing in learning from Daqing is to learn the revolutionization of people. Without this, it is impossible to master the Daqing experience.

    Chen Qifa, Director of the Political Office of the Qinghai Petroleum Administration Bureau, said: There are many gaps between us and Daqing, and the lack of revolutionization of people is the most fundamental one. When we first started learning from Daqing, some people there said: "Working as hard and tirelessly as the Daqing people is fine for three or five days, but it will be difficult for three or five years." Some people also found it incomprehensible that Daqing had a "six-year battle like one day." This is the gap in the revolutionization of people. Without ideological revolutionization, one cannot understand or accept the Daqing experience, and therefore cannot master it. The Daqing experience tells us to lead the team by first leading the ideology, second leading the work style, and third leading the methods and technology. Because the workers and staff have revolutionary ideas and a revolutionary work style, they will have a strong fighting force; coupled with good methods and technology, the tasks will be completed even more outstandingly. In the past year or so, we have worked hard to learn from Daqing in these three areas, so that the revolutionary spirit of Daqing has taken root in the minds of the masses, and we have begun to achieve relatively significant results.

    Zhu Hezeng, Captain of Production Team 6502 of the Ministry of Petroleum, said: When we learn from Daqing, we first learn Daqing's emphasis on "strictness," making strict demands on operations, technology, and management; second, we learn Daqing's simple living facilities, building houses ourselves; third, we learn Daqing's style of "three honesties and four strictnesses" and "four same's," and implement a post responsibility system; fourth, we learn Daqing's revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, encouraging all employees to compare their efforts with Daqing and find gaps. In the previous period, our materials department learned from Daqing to deliver materials to the door, but they did not learn well. Why? The reason is that they did not learn the revolutionary spirit of others. The Daqing functional departments have a clear idea of serving the grassroots, are familiar with the production situation; we do not understand the production needs, and the materials sent down are not used, so the workers are naturally not welcome.

    Xu Yongchun, a foreman at the Lanzhou Chemical Fertilizer Plant, said: In the past, we also learned from Daqing to establish a handover system, making strict demands everywhere, but because people's thinking was not revolutionized, the results were not great. "Strict requirements" turned into mutual picking on each other, and even affected the unity between workers. Later, we realized that without the revolutionization of people's thinking, strict requirements alone would not have any effect. Therefore, we focused on grasping the ideological revolutionization of people, and also took turns sending cadres above the team leader level to the Lanzhou Refinery to learn from the advanced and find gaps. This mobilized people's enthusiasm, and the results were relatively large. In the past, our factory's equipment was not very good, which affected the completion of the production plan. Now the equipment's integrity rate has been greatly improved, and the production plan has also been completed relatively well.

    The Revolutionization of People Comes from Creatively Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works

    How to promote the revolutionization of people? The comrades who spoke unanimously believed that the most fundamental thing is to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

    Yu Qunli, Acting Director of the Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau, said: The most fundamental aspect of the Daqing spirit is starting with "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," and guiding everything with Mao Zedong Thought. Yumen has been learning from Daqing for four years from the beginning to now, and it was not until the past year or so that there has been greater development, because in the past we did not grasp this most fundamental issue. In the past year or so, we have focused on grasping the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works, with the top leaders of party committees at all levels personally responsible for leading, emphasizing that it is not about reading a lot, but about using it well and seeing practical results. As a result, the idea of "listening to the Party's words for a lifetime, reading Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, guarding the Gobi Desert for a lifetime, and working for the country's petroleum industry for a lifetime" has become widespread, and the changes in production have been great.

    Chen Qifa said: The revolutionization of people comes from Mao Zedong Thought. The workers have a deep understanding of this. They said: "We listen to Chairman Mao's words, and the oil wells listen to our words," "To fight tough battles in production, we rely entirely on tough ideas; to refine tough ideas, we must read Chairman's books." Now, the activities of studying Chairman Mao's works are more extensive and more solid, especially after repeatedly emphasizing the effort in the word "use," the effect is even more significant. Well Work Team 1031 is a revolutionary team that has grown up by creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our area, and is known as the "hard bone" team.

    Yang Peichen, Political Commissar of the Xinjiang Mosuowan Tractor Repair Factory, said: When we started learning from Daqing, we first learned the "five lines" of the workers' dormitories. Later, we realized that the ideological revolutionization of people was the most important thing, so we started by organizing workers to study Chairman Mao's works. People's ideological outlook has changed, and many new atmospheres have emerged. On this basis, we then organized civilized production, improved the five-good equipment and work order, and established a strict and meticulous work style. In the past, our factory only received eight tractor repair tasks for the whole year because of the poor repair quality. After learning from Daqing, the repair quality improved, and many farms competed to send their tractors for repair.

    Whether We Learn Well Depends on Whether the Leadership's Revolutionization Is Sufficient

    Bian Feng, Director of the Northwest State Cotton Mill No. 1, said: Whether an enterprise learns well from Daqing depends on the leadership, on the enterprise's party committee. We believe that wherever there is good leadership, there will be "Wang Jinxi's." The workers are willing to learn from Daqing and are willing to make greater contributions to the country like Daqing, it just depends on whether the leadership is good!

    Yu Qunli said: The masses are very eager to learn from Daqing, their emotions are very high, and their fighting spirit is very strong. Whether an enterprise learns well from Daqing depends on the leadership. Daqing's mass line is implemented very well. Where did Daqing's post responsibility system come from? It came from the masses. Once they see it, they will grasp it to the end, grasping what they grasp and not letting go, and what they grasp becomes the style. Yumen had an inspection system and a handover system a long time ago, but no one regarded it as the fundamental issue of grassroots construction and grasped it tightly. Therefore, it rose up and then went down.

    Yu Qunli said: Many of Daqing's cadres came from Yumen. After arriving in Daqing, they are full of energy, have many methods, and are very capable, as if they have completely changed. Why? Because Daqing's leading cadres pay great attention to using Mao Zedong Thought to inspire cadres' thinking, to enlighten people, to dare to break the old, and to dare to establish the new. We often hold on to the cadres and make many lively things dead. Daqing's criticism of cadres is also very strict, sometimes criticizing you until you are sweating profusely. However, the criticized people are convinced. Why? Because Daqing's leaders know people very well, they criticize the right place and can stimulate people's enthusiasm. To master these leadership methods and leadership art of Daqing, we need to work hard.

    Yu Qunli said: We are now improving leadership in four aspects to promote leadership revolutionization. First, thoroughly understand both ends. Conscientiously study Mao Zedong Thought, the central government's policies, and the instructions of higher authorities, understand the essence of the spirit, resolutely implement it without deviating, and at the same time go deep into reality, investigate and study, find problems, carve out models, summarize experience, and implement face-to-face leadership. Second, be brave to take responsibility in work and play an exemplary role. At critical moments and in key places, leading cadres must step up and set an example for the masses. If problems arise in the work, the leadership should first take responsibility, and do not blame others, or dampen the revolutionary spirit of the masses. Third, treat the shortcomings and mistakes of leading cadres seriously, without condoning them or letting them go. Fourth, do not engage in special privileges in lifestyle, and implement "four togethers" with the masses when going deep into the grassroots for observation or investigation.

    Chen Qifa said: When we grasp the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works, we first grasp the leading cadres taking the lead in studying and applying it; when we grasp the strict and meticulous work style, we first grasp the strict and meticulous work style of the leading cadres. Workers often say: "The problem lies in the grassroots, and the root is in the leadership, mainly because the leadership's work style is not strong enough." Why is the leadership's work style not strong enough? One is afraid that being strict will "offend people," and the other is afraid that being strict will lead to more problems, and they will have to take responsibility for solving them themselves. Many leading cadres have dug up these ideological roots in studying Chairman Mao's works and have taken the lead in establishing a strict and meticulous work style, and the workers and masses have quickly followed suit.

    To Learn from Daqing, We Must Grasp It from Top to Bottom to the End

    Bian Feng said: Through the socialist education movement and the enterprise management revolution, it now seems that to truly run an enterprise well, we must learn from Daqing and take the Daqing road. This is our direction of effort. Since it is the direction, we must have a unified goal from top to bottom and have an overall plan, and not just shout slogans or grasp it for a while and then be done with it. Why does the petroleum department system learn from Daqing so well? It is because the Ministry of Petroleum grasps it well, grasping it tightly and grasping it to the end. (Several comrades from the petroleum system at the meeting said: The Ministry of Petroleum has grasped learning from Daqing very early and very tightly. Every time the ministry's inspection team comes down to inspect the work, they use learning from Daqing as a yardstick for inspection.) Of course, this is not to say that whether we learn well from Daqing depends on the higher authorities. The responsibility is still on ourselves. However, to make the enterprises in this system become Daqing-style enterprises, the leading organs must learn from the Ministry of Petroleum and grasp it from top to bottom to the end.

### 西北地区一些工业企业的同志座谈学大庆问题  怎样把大庆经验学到手  关键是领导干部革命化

    西北地区一些工业企业的同志座谈学大庆问题
    怎样把大庆经验学到手
    关键是领导干部革命化
    编者按　怎样把大庆经验学到手？西北地区一些工业企业的同志，在本报记者邀集的座谈会上说：“一个企业学大庆学得好不好，关键在于领导干部的革命化够不够。”这是经验之谈。
    大庆是工业战线活学活用毛泽东思想的范例，是学习和运用解放军政治工作经验的范例，是贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线的范例。大庆的经验，不是工业建设某一个方面的经验，而是按照毛泽东思想办企业，走中国自己的道路的方向性的经验。从这个意义上说，不下苦功，不花力气，是不能把大庆经验学到手的。
    但是，大庆经验又不是高不可攀的。大庆经验最核心的一条，就是活学活用毛泽东思想，以阶级斗争、两条道路斗争为纲，促进人的革命化，首先是领导干部的革命化。我们抓住这个核心，认真去做，“一通百通”，大庆经验是可以学到的，大庆是可以赶上而且可以超过的。
    现在，学大庆正在变成所有企业的行动口号。全国已经出现了不少大庆式企业，还会出现更多的大庆式企业。形势逼人，被“逼”的不仅仅是企业，还有领导企业的领导机关。领导机关革命化，才能领导企业的革命化。这是值得所有企业的领导机关认真考虑的。
    我们希望，各地工业企业和企业领导机关的同志，针对“怎样把大庆经验学到手”这个问题，谈谈自己的体会，发表自己的意见。
    本报西安七日电　“学大庆，最重要的是学大庆经验的核心——人的革命化；一个企业学大庆学得好不好，关键在于领导干部的革命化够不够。”这是西北地区部分企业的同志在本报记者邀集的座谈会上提出的意见。出席座谈会的有西北五个省区部分工矿企业的领导干部和工人十多人。
    没有革命精神，学不到大庆经验
    发言的同志一致认为：大庆经验全面体现了毛泽东思想和社会主义建设总路线精神，是用毛泽东思想办企业、走我们自己的道路的范例。大庆经验的核心是人的革命化，是突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装职工的头脑。学大庆，最重要的就是要学人的革命化。没有这一条，就不可能把大庆经验学到手。
    青海石油管理局政治办公室主任陈启发说：我们同大庆的差距很多，人的革命化不如大庆，这一条是最根本的差距。刚开始学大庆时，我们那里有人说：“象大庆人那样不怕苦、不怕累地干，三天五天可以，三年五年就难了。”也有人对大庆“会战六年如一日”感到不能理解。这就是人的革命化的差距。思想没有革命化，对大庆经验就感到不能理解，接受不了，也就学不到手。大庆经验告诉我们，带队伍，一带思想，二带作风，三带方法和技术。因为职工队伍有了革命思想，有了革命作风，才会有顽强的战斗力；再加上好的方法和技术，就会使任务完成得更出色。最近一年多来，我们从这三个方面下功夫学大庆，使大庆的革命精神在群众思想上扎了根，就开始取得了比较显著的成效。
    石油部六五○二生产队中队长朱和增说：我们学大庆，一学大庆“严”字当头，从操作上、技术上、管理上严格要求；二学大庆生活设施从简，自己动手盖房子；三学大庆“三老四严”、“四个一样”的作风，实行岗位责任制；四学大庆艰苦奋斗的革命精神，激励全体职工同大庆比干劲，找差距。前一个时期，我们的材料部门学习大庆送料上门，没有学好。为什么呢？原因就是没有把人家的革命精神学到手。大庆职能部门为基层服务的思想明确，熟知生产情况；我们不了解生产需要，送下去的材料用不上，工人自然不欢迎。
    兰州化肥厂工长徐永春说：以前我们也学大庆那样建立交接班制度，处处严格要求，但是由于人的思想没有革命化，收效不大，“严格要求”变成了互相挑剔，甚至影响到工人之间的团结。后来我们体会到，人的思想没有革命化，光是要求严格，是不会有什么效果的。于是，我们便着重抓人的思想革命化，还轮流把班组长以上的干部送到兰州炼油厂，学先进找差距。这样把人的积极性调动起来了，收效就比较大。过去我们厂的设备状况不很好，影响生产计划的完成，现在设备的完好率大大提高，生产计划也完成得比较好。
    人的革命化，来自活学活用毛主席著作
    怎样促使人的革命化？发言的同志一致认为：最根本的是活学活用毛主席著作。
    玉门石油管理局代局长余群立说：大庆精神最根本的一条，就是“两论”起家，用毛泽东思想指导一切。玉门学大庆，从开始到现在四年了，直到最近一年多，才有比较大的发展，原因就是过去没有抓这个最根本的问题。这一年多来，我们突出抓了活学活用毛主席著作，各级党委的第一把手亲自负责领导，强调不在看得多，而在用得好，见实效。结果，“党的话听一辈子，毛主席的书读一辈子，在戈壁滩守一辈子，为祖国石油工业干一辈子”的思想普遍了，生产上的变化很大。
    陈启发说：人的革命化来自毛泽东思想。工人们对这一点体会很深。他们说：“我们听毛主席的话，油井就听我们的话”，“生产打硬仗，全靠硬思想；要炼硬思想，必读主席书。”现在，学习毛主席著作的活动更广泛、更扎实了，特别是反复强调在“用”字上下功夫以后，效果更显著。一零三一井下作业队，就是我们那里活学活用毛主席著作成长起来的一支革命化的队伍，被人称为“硬骨头”队。
    新疆莫索湾拖拉机修配厂政委杨培臣说：我们开始学大庆时，先学职工宿舍“五条线”，后来体会到人的思想革命化才是首要的，便从组织职工学习毛主席著作入手。人们思想面貌改变了，出现了许多新气象。在这个基础上再组织文明生产，搞五好设备和工作条理化，树立了严细作风。过去，我们厂因为修理质量不高，一度弄到全年只接到八台拖拉机的修理任务。学大庆以后，修理质量提高了，许多农场都争着把拖拉机送来修。
    学得好不好，关键是领导革命化够不够
    西北国棉一厂厂长边丰说：一个企业学大庆学得好不好，关键是领导的问题，是企业党委的问题。我们认为，那里有好领导，那里都能出“王铁人”。工人都愿意学大庆，都愿意象大庆那样对国家做出更大的贡献，就看领导得好不好！
    余群立说：群众学大庆的心很切，情绪很高，斗志很旺盛。一个企业学大庆学得好不好，问题在领导方面。大庆的群众路线就贯彻得很好。大庆的岗位责任制从哪里来的？从群众中来的。他们看准了，就一抓到底，抓什么就抓住不放，抓什么就什么成风。玉门很早就搞过巡回检查制，交接班制，但是谁也没有把它当成基层建设的根本问题抓住不放。因此起来了，又下去了。
    余群立说：大庆的干部有很多都是玉门去的。到了大庆以后，他们生龙活虎，办法很多，水平很高，好象完全变了一个人。为什么呢？因为大庆的领导干部很注意用毛泽东思想去启发干部的思路，使人开窍，敢于破旧，敢于立新。我们对干部常常是把住不放，把许多活事都办死了。大庆对干部的批评也很严，有时批评得你满头大汗。但是，被批评的人口服心服。为什么呢？因为大庆领导上很了解人，批评的是地方，能够激发人的干劲。要把大庆的这些领导方法、领导艺术学到手，需要我们狠下功夫。
    余群立说：我们现在从四个方面来改进领导工作，促进领导革命化。第一，吃透两头。认真学习毛泽东思想、中央的方针和上级指示，领会精神实质，不走样子地坚决贯彻执行，同时深入实际，调查研究，摸问题，刻样板，总结经验，实行面对面的领导。第二，工作要勇于负责，起模范带头作用。关键的时刻，关键的地方，领导干部一定要顶上去，给群众作出榜样。工作中出了问题，领导要首先承担责任，不要怨上怪下，挫伤群众的革命锐气。第三，对领导干部的缺点和错误要严肃对待，不迁就，不放任。第四，生活作风上不搞特殊化，在深入基层蹲点或调查研究时，要和群众实行“四同”。
    陈启发说：我们抓活学活用毛主席著作，首先就抓领导干部带头学、带头用；抓严细作风，首先就抓领导干部的严细作风。工人们常说：“问题出在基层，根子在领导身上，主要是领导作风不过硬。”为什么领导作风不过硬呢？一怕严了“得罪人”，二怕严了问题多，要自己去负责解决。许多领导干部在学习毛主席著作中挖了这些思想上的根子，带头树立了严细作风，职工群众也就很快跟上来了。
    学大庆，要从上到下一抓到底
    边丰说：通过社会主义教育运动和企业管理革命，现在看来，要真正把一个企业办好，非学大庆不可，非走大庆的道路不可。这是我们努力的方向。既然是方向，就要从上到下目标一致，有一个通盘的规划，不要只是喊一喊，抓一阵，就算了。石油部系统为什么学大庆学得好呢？是石油部抓得好，抓住不放，一抓到底。（会上石油系统的几个同志说：石油部抓学大庆抓得很早、很紧，每次部里的检查团下来检查工作，把学大庆当着一把检查的尺子。）当然，这不是说我们学大庆学得好不好，要上面来负责。责任还在我们自己。但是，要使本系统的企业成为大庆式的企业，领导机关就要学石油部那样从上到下，一抓到底。
