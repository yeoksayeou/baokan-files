    After Seven Years of Production Practice and Scientific Experiments
    New Nitrogen Fertilizer Production Process Proven Advanced, Economical, and Reasonable
    Adopting this process shortens the production flow, saves construction investment, requires a short construction period, equipment is easy to manufacture, and power consumption is low.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 31st – China’s original new nitrogen fertilizer production process, after seven years of production practice and scientific experiments, has proven to be a new path for developing China's chemical fertilizer industry in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical.
    Recently, the State Science and Technology Commission entrusted the Ministry of Chemical Industry to conduct a comprehensive technical appraisal of it, and concluded that this new process is technically advanced and economically reasonable.
    The experimental plan for this new nitrogen fertilizer production process was formulated under the direction of China's renowned chemist Hou Debang. After several years of practice by the Shanghai Chemical Industry Research Institute, the Beijing Chemical Experimental Plant, and the Danyang Fertilizer Plant in Jiangsu, and continuous improvements by fertilizer plants in various regions, it has been successfully achieved.
    Practice has proven that this process is more suitable for promotion in small and medium-sized nitrogen fertilizer plants. Its advantages are shortening the production process, saving basic construction investment, requiring a short construction period, equipment is easy to manufacture, and power consumption is low. Therefore, it creates favorable conditions for the development of chemical fertilizers.
    The ammonium bicarbonate nitrogen fertilizer produced by the new process has a nitrogen content of about 17.5%. It is a water-soluble, nearly neutral solid chemical fertilizer with no side effects on the soil. Because it contains carbon dioxide, it is easily absorbed by the roots of crops, which is beneficial to crop growth.
    According to several years of experiments by agricultural science departments and the results of large-scale use in vast rural areas, its fertilizer effect is significant. If used reasonably, the fertilizer effect is comparable to other nitrogen fertilizers. Due to the easy decomposition of ammonium bicarbonate, the requirements for packaging and use are relatively high.
    The birth of this new process has gone through a difficult and tortuous struggle, overcoming ideological, technical, and economic hurdles. Its success illustrates that China's small nitrogen fertilizer plants have strong vitality.
    This new process has now begun to be used in the construction of large and medium-sized nitrogen fertilizer plants. Relevant departments believe that China's use of the new process to produce ammonium bicarbonate has developed to a relatively large scale. To meet the agricultural needs for nitrogen fertilizer, there will be even greater development in the future. Therefore, it is currently necessary to conduct more systematic research on various issues related to ammonium bicarbonate in order to further solve the problems of production stability and rational use of ammonium bicarbonate economically and effectively.

    经过七年来生产实践和科学试验证明
    氮肥生产新流程技术先进经济合理
    采用这种工艺，缩短生产流程，节省建设投资，建厂时间短，设备容易制造，动力消耗少
    新华社南京三十一日电  我国首创的氮肥生产新流程经过七年来的生产实践和科学试验，证明它是多快好省地发展我国化学肥料工业的一条新路。
    最近，国家科学委员会委托化工部对它作了全面的技术鉴定，认为这项新流程技术上先进，经济上合理。
    这项氮肥生产新流程的试验方案，是在我国著名化学家侯德榜主持下制订的，并且经过上海化工研究院、北京化工实验厂和江苏丹阳化肥厂等单位几年的实践，又经过各地化肥厂的不断改进才获得成功的。
    实践证明，这种流程更适合在中小型氮肥厂推广。它的优越性是缩短了生产流程，节省了基本建设投资，建厂时间短，设备容易制造，动力消耗少。因此，它为化学肥料的发展创造了有利条件。
    新流程所生产的氮肥碳酸氢铵，含氮量为百分之十七点五左右，是一种易溶于水，接近中性的固体化学肥料，对土壤没有副作用。因为它含有二氧化碳，容易被农作物的根部吸收，有利于农作物的生长。
    根据农业科学部门几年来的试验和广大农村大面积使用的结果证明，它的肥效显著，如果使用合理，肥效和别的氮肥差不多。由于碳酸氢铵容易分解，因此，对包装和使用的要求较高。
    这项新流程的诞生，曾经经历了一段艰苦曲折的斗争，闯过了思想关、技术关、经济关。它的获得成功，说明我国小型氮肥厂有强大的生命力。
    这种新流程现在已经开始用于建造大中型氮肥厂。有关部门认为，我国采用新流程生产碳酸氢铵已发展到较大规模，为适应农业对氮肥的需要，今后还会有更大的发展。因此，目前需要对有关碳酸氢铵的各项问题进行更为系统地研究，以便既经济又有效地进一步解决碳酸氢铵的生产稳定性和合理使用问题。
