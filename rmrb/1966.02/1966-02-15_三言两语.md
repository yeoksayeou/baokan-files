    Three Short Comments
    The Beaten Dog
    American Senator Russell, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he "does not support a policy of running away like a whipped dog with its tail between its legs."
    Using "a whipped dog" to describe the plight of American imperialism in the war of aggression against Vietnam is indeed quite vivid. Under the lash of the whip, what other fate could such a stray dog have other than to continue to be beaten even harder if it does not tuck its tail between its legs and flee?
    The Scolded Running Dog
    The American magazine *Newsweek* exposed the serious corruption of the Thai ruling clique, which aroused dissatisfaction among the Thai reactionaries. Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Army Commander-in-Chief Praphas Charusathien openly stated at a press conference that he was annoyed by the "impolite" treatment by the American publication of the Thai ruling group's enthusiastic service as a henchman for the United States in expanding the Indochina war of aggression. The aggrieved mood of the running dog is completely understandable.
    The Bangkok authorities were exasperated and retaliated through a diplomatic official, saying that Thailand's corruption phenomenon was far less "experienced" than that of the United States, and that the United States had "almost become an expert on corruption issues in the free world." Just as *Newsweek's* words were not wrong, the words of this Thai official were also correct. This is called like master, like servant.

### 三言两语

    三言两语
    挨打的狗
    美国参议院军事委员会主席拉塞尔表示，他“不支持象一条被鞭打的狗夹着尾巴逃跑的政策”。
    用“一条被鞭打的狗”来形容美帝国主义在侵越战争中的狼狈处境，的确是蛮形象的。这样一只丧家之犬在皮鞭之下，不夹着尾巴逃跑，除了继续挨到更重的鞭打之外，又还能有什么其他的命运呢？
    挨骂的走狗
    美国《新闻周刊》揭露泰国统治集团内部贪污腐化严重，引起了泰国反动派的不满。泰国副总理兼陆军总司令巴博在记者招待会上公开表示，对于泰国统治集团热心为美国扩大印度支那侵略战争充当打手，而受到美国刊物如此“无礼貌”的对待，感到恼火。走狗的委屈心情是完全可以理解的。
    曼谷当局恼羞成怒，由一名外交官员出面反唇相讥说，泰国的贪污现象，远不如美国那样“深具经验”，美国“几乎成为自由世界的贪污问题专家”。正如《新闻周刊》的话没有说错一样，这个泰国官员的话也是对的。这叫做有其主，必有其仆。
