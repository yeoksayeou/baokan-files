　　Xinhua News Agency, February 26th – The Ministry of Culture and its affiliated units recently held a conference to exchange experiences in studying Chairman Mao's writings. At the meeting, many activists, through their own learning gains, explained that to stand firm in the complex class struggles on the domestic and international literary and art fronts, to resolutely implement the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialism in literature and art, and to be a steadfast proletarian literary and art fighter, one cannot leave Mao Zedong Thought for even a moment, nor can one forget to use proletarian politics to command professional work! This is their personal experience in studying Chairman Mao's writings.
    In the past year, under the great situation of the industrial and agricultural fronts and the encouragement of the cultural revolution movement, the Ministry of Culture and its affiliated units, taking the People's Liberation Army, Daqing, and Dazhai as examples, began to set off a new upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's writings, which promoted the ideological revolution of literary and art workers, thus giving the entire cultural work a new look. Currently, in the Ministry of Culture and its affiliated units, political enthusiasm is high, and the number of personnel going to the mountains and countryside and to factories and mines to participate in the socialist education movement and popularize revolutionary culture has accounted for more than 60% of the total number that should go down. Revolutionary modern dramas have occupied the entire stage, and new works reflecting socialism and praising contemporary worker-peasant-soldier heroes are constantly emerging.
    Whether to study Chairman Mao's writings is related to whether one can be a proletarian literary and art fighter
    The 307 representatives attending the meeting were selected from a large number of activists in studying Chairman Mao's writings. During the meeting, 125 people spoke at the plenary session or small groups, including actors, directors, editors, art personnel, technical personnel, teachers, narrators, workers, service personnel, students, and political work cadres. Nearly 6,000 people visited the learning experience exhibition. These representatives of learning activists emphasized that the reason why they have achieved greater results in restudying Chairman Mao's writings at this stage is mainly because they have paid attention to overcoming the shortcomings of theory being divorced from practice and have begun to put effort into the word "use," earnestly transforming their thinking and guiding their work according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They said: Whether literary and art workers study Chairman Mao's writings is related to whether they can be a proletarian literary and art fighter. Without the consciousness of studying for the revolution, without proletarian feelings, and without taking class struggle as the key link, it is impossible to achieve learning for application, and it is impossible to truly understand and grasp Mao Zedong Thought, and it is impossible to wholeheartedly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve socialism.
    "Our literary and art workers must complete this task, must shift their standpoint, must gradually shift over to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat in the process of going deeply among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, going deeply into practical struggle, and in the process of studying Marxism and studying society. Only in this way can we have truly literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, truly proletarian literature and art." This is the sentence that everyone felt the deepest when studying Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." They said that to implement this point, the first thing to do is to make a "breakthrough" on the issue of worldview of serving whom and whether to revolutionize, open up a battlefield for promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie in one's own mind, and persistently follow Chairman Mao's instructions to fight against bourgeois individual fame and fortune ideology and all non-proletarian ideologies, gradually establish a proletarian worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people, and completely dig out the root of revisionism.
    Peking opera actress Du Jinfang said that she used to like to play leading roles and was even unwilling to play roles that others had played. Therefore, when the leadership assigned her to play the second female lead Li Tiemei in "The Red Lantern," this individual fame and fortune ideology had a sharp conflict with the needs of the revolution. At that time, some comments around her that "playing a second female role is really stupid" also fueled her ideological fluctuations. Du Jinfang, with this question, restudied "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune."
　　She gradually realized that playing a leading role or a second role is equally doing revolution; being able to overcome the ideology of individual fame and fortune and play a second role well is precisely the beginning of my becoming smart, how can it be said to be "stupid"? It is precisely this kind of thinking and determination to "perform revolutionary dramas, first be a revolutionary person" that has prompted Du Jinfang to learn from and help the leading actress earnestly, better shaping the heroic image of Li Tiemei; and prompted her to go out of the theater to perform for farmers in the wind and sand swept square. Not long ago, when she went deep into life in a certain hospital, she also put down the airs of a famous actress according to Chairman Mao's teaching of "heal the wounded, rescue the dying, practice revolutionary humanitarianism," patiently serving patients and singing "The Red Lantern," and the patients called her a good comrade sent by Chairman Mao. One experience Du Jinfang gained from the ideological transformation of this period is that the enemy in thought cannot be defeated without fighting, and individualism must never be defended, and one must take the initiative to attack as soon as the "I" character appears.
    Xiao Suhua, a teacher at the Beijing Ballet School, also had the same experience. He used to wrongly believe that: I neither oppose the Party nor oppose socialism, and a "little" bit of individualism is "inevitable." In the process of studying Chairman Mao's writings, Xiao Suhua took Lei Feng as an example to compare himself, summed up the lessons of individualism, and finally made it clear that wholeheartedly serving the people and individualism are incompatible. He said that legalizing so-called "small" individualism is equivalent to installing a "time bomb" in the mind. After that, Xiao Suhua's spiritual outlook changed. He not only overcame the idea of not being at ease with teaching work, but was also praised for donating blood to the wounded and sick.
    Such examples can be found in many units of the Ministry of Culture and its affiliated units. Some literary and art workers from good family backgrounds got rid of the blindness of being "naturally red" and "almost," and strengthened the consciousness of ideological transformation; some people from exploiting-class families more thoroughly drew a line in thought with their families and classes, and were determined to be proletarian literary and art fighters; an art worker who was deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology took the initiative to criticize the wrong idea of not caring about the collective and concentrating on personal creation in the "private plot" and pursuing remuneration, and was determined to get out of the small world of individualism and devote all his energy to revolutionary work. He said with deep feeling, "There are no holidays on the ideological front," and he will insist on studying Chairman Mao's writings in the future and resolutely fight the bourgeois ideology to the end.
    To transform the worldview, one must consciously combine the study of Chairman Mao's writings with going deeply among the workers, peasants, and soldiers and learning from the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Chairman Mao said: "If intellectuals unite with the worker-peasant masses and become friends with them, they can turn the Marxism they have learned from books into their own things. To learn Marxism, one must not only learn from books, but mainly learn through class struggle, work practice, and approaching the worker-peasant masses to truly learn it." Many literary and art workers have increasingly realized the great significance of Chairman Mao's instruction from their own practice of going deeply among the worker-peasant masses and transforming their thinking.
    The three young creative cadres from the Chinese Opera Research Institute who squatted in the Nanliu Brigade of Jiang County, Shanxi Province, have made rapid progress on the road of revolutionizing and laborizing because they worked and studied Chairman Mao's writings with the laboring people of Nanliu and the former Party branch secretary of this brigade, Zhou Mingshan. One of the main learning experiences of this squatting group is that ideological transformation is determined by internal causes. They believe that uniting with the worker-peasant masses is not enough to generally achieve the same eating, living, and laboring, but more importantly, must achieve "the same heart," which must consciously combine the study of Chairman Mao's writings with the study of the laboring people. These three young creative cadres did not satisfy themselves with passing the "labor pass" in going deep into life, but further used the high standard of breathing the same breath and sharing the same fate with the poor and lower-middle peasants to demand themselves. They often pay attention to how Chairman Mao said, how the masses did it, and how they thought and did, constantly finding gaps, and "climbing higher and higher" on the journey of transforming their thinking and emotions, so they began to be able to like what the masses like, worry about what the masses worry about, and regard the affairs of the team as their own affairs. Later, these young people, led by group leader Wang Ankui, participated in the work of the production team and were regarded as confidants by the commune members. When the creation group of the China Youth Art Theater going to Daqing summed up the experience of combining with workers, they also pointed out that the reason why they could not go deep and write well in the first stage was mainly because some people regarded participating in labor as "capital" for obtaining personal fame and fortune in writing scripts in the future. In the process of studying Chairman Mao's writings, they criticized this wrong idea and wholeheartedly combined with the workers, honestly doing the workers' elementary school students. They not only learned from the workers as teachers in labor training and ideological transformation, but also learned from the workers as teachers in creation. After a long period of repeated revisions, they finally laid a better ideological and life foundation for the creation of the drama "Ode to Petroleum."
    Many literary and art workers use the intimate languages of "giving charcoal in the snow, warming themselves," as well as "like a fish in water" and "a frog at the bottom of a well jumping out of the well" to describe the sweetness they have tasted after going deep into the life of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and more deeply realized the truth that Chairman Mao instructed that the struggle life of workers, peasants, and soldiers is the only source of literary and artistic creation. All the members of the crew of "Red Basket" of Beijing Film Studio, with the determination of "learning the basket, acting the basket," carried Chairman Mao's writings, carried photographic equipment and goods, climbed mountains to deliver goods with the shop assistants of the basket shop, lived together, and created collectively. The red salesmen's revolutionary spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people encouraged the playwrights to squat on the wall and use their knees as "tables" to write the theme song praising the basket spirit with full enthusiasm; it was also the salesmen's revolutionary perseverance of eating great hardship and enduring hard work that inspired the creators to break the rules and shoot this film quickly and well with revolutionary methods. The creative practice of this crew shows that only by listening to Chairman Mao's words, personally participating in the revolutionary struggle of the masses, and "integrating with the thoughts and feelings of the worker-peasant-soldier masses," are they qualified to be spokespersons for the masses.
    Whether Mao Zedong Thought is understood depends on whether the achievements of ideological transformation can be used to guide work practice, combine the transformation of the subjective world with the transformation of the objective world, and resolutely use politics to command professional work.
    Many people also pointed out when talking about their learning experience that whether they have understood Chairman Mao's thought depends on whether they can use the achievements of ideological transformation to guide their work practice, combine the transformation of the subjective world with the transformation of the objective world, and resolutely use politics to command their professional work. The Central Orchestra, which is exploring the revolutionization, nationalization, and massification of foreign art forms, feels this issue more closely. In order to better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, the orchestra's symphony orchestra, in the past year, according to Chairman Mao's teachings of "foreign things serving China" and "ancient things serving the present," created and performed revolutionary modern symphonic works with national style, such as Peking opera chorus "Shajiabang" and "Revolutionary Songs Medley", which were well received by workers, peasants and soldiers. In the process of creating the symphonic music “Revolutionary Songs Medley,” in order to reflect the jubilant mood of the masses celebrating the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the authors broke the frame and added a passage of cheering "Long live Chairman Mao" in human voices. At this time, some people agreed, and some people thought that it "did not quite conform to the artistic rules of symphony music". However, after the performance, the worker-peasant-soldier audience was very excited and said, "This slogan is well added" and "shouted out our hearts." Why is there such a big gap between our own views and those of the workers, peasants and soldiers? From this vivid lesson, the symphony orchestra realized that the problem lies not in what artistic rules, but in the lack of a common language between them and the workers, peasants and soldiers. Sun Jiaxin, a coloratura soprano soloist of the orchestra, also encountered a serious test of possible loss of voice and inability to sing coloratura again in the process of learning Hebei Bangzi and exploring new singing methods combining native and foreign styles. At this time, she used what Chairman Mao said, "There is often such a situation that favorable situations and the recovery of initiative arise from the effort to 'persevere a little longer'" to encourage herself, resolutely eliminate personal distracting thoughts, and invest in arduous practice boldly and solidly with the revolutionary attitude of even if she fails, she must gain experience for others. As a result, she successfully overcame the "aphonia" barrier twice, neither ruining her voice nor learning new skills, providing favorable conditions for creating new coloratura singing methods combining native and foreign styles. This business experiment emphasizing politics greatly enhanced Sun Jiaxin's revolutionary courage. She said: As long as we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, think about the workers, peasants and soldiers in our hearts at all times, despise difficulties strategically and value difficulties tactically, we will be invincible.
    The study of Chairman Mao's writings in the Ministry of Culture and its affiliated units has formed a mass movement. It not only prompted new faces in the ideology and work of various units, but also had an increasingly profound impact on improving work style, promoting the unity of the literary and artistic team, and even establishing a hard-working and simple life style. Currently, all literary and art units are combining the study of the revolutionary spirit of Jiao Yulu, a model county party secretary, to push the study of Chairman Mao's writings to a new climax. Under the leadership of the Party Committee of the Ministry of Culture of the Communist Party of China, all units are establishing advanced models, finding gaps, overcoming imbalances in learning, further improving the consciousness of learning for the revolution, improving the learning system, especially focusing on the learning and flexible application of leading cadres in these two important aspects, so as to guide this mass learning movement to develop forward more widely, persistently, deeply and practically.

### 文艺工作者谈学习毛主席著作的体会： 关键是改造世界观  首先要从为谁服务、革命不革命的问题上打开“突破口”坚持不懈地同个人名利思想和一切非无产阶级思想作斗争

　　文艺工作者谈学习毛主席著作的体会：
　　关键是改造世界观
　　首先要从为谁服务、革命不革命的问题上打开“突破口”坚持不懈地同个人名利思想和一切非无产阶级思想作斗争
    新华社二十六日讯　文化部和所属单位不久以前举行了学习毛主席著作经验交流会。会上，许多学习积极分子通过自己的学习收获说明：要在国内外文艺战线上复杂的阶级斗争中站稳立场，坚决贯彻文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的方向，做一个坚定的无产阶级文艺战士，就一步也不能离开毛泽东思想，一时一刻也不能忘记用无产阶级政治来统帅业务！这是他们学习毛主席著作的切身体会。
    在过去的一年里，文化部和所属单位在工农业战线大好形势和文化革命运动的鼓舞下，以解放军、大庆、大寨为榜样，开始掀起了学习毛主席著作的新的热潮，促进了文艺工作者的思想革命，从而使整个文化工作出现了新的气象。目前，在文化部和所属单位中，政治热情高涨，上山下乡下厂矿参加社会主义教育运动和普及革命文化的人员，已经占应当下去的总人数的百分之六十以上，革命现代戏占领了整个舞台，反映社会主义、歌颂当代工农兵英雄人物的新作品正在不断涌现。
    学习不学习毛主席著作，是关系到能不能做无产阶级文艺战士的问题
    出席这次会议的三百零七位代表，是从大量学习毛主席著作积极分子中推选出来的。会议期间，有一百二十五人在大会或小会上发了言，其中包括演员、编导、编辑、美术人员、技术人员、教师、讲解员、工人、公勤人员、学生以及政治工作干部等。还有近六千人次参观了学习经验展览会。这些学习积极分子代表们着重指出，他们这个阶段重新学习毛主席著作所以收效较大，主要是由于注意克服理论脱离实际的缺点，开始把功夫下在“用”字上，切实按照毛主席的指示来改造思想、指导工作的结果。他们说：文艺工作者学不学毛主席著作，是关系到能不能做一个无产阶级的文艺战士的问题。没有为革命而学习的自觉性，不带着无产阶级的感情，不以阶级斗争为纲，就不能做到学以致用，也就不可能真正领会和掌握毛主席思想，不可能全心全意为工农兵、为社会主义服务。
    “我们的文艺工作者一定要完成这个任务，一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺，真正无产阶级的文艺。”这是大家学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》时感受最深的一段话。他们说，要实行这一点，首先就要从为谁服务、革命不革命这个世界观问题上打开“突破口”，在自己的头脑中开辟一个兴无灭资的战场，坚持不懈地按照毛主席的指示，同资产阶级个人名利思想以及一切非无产阶级思想做斗争，逐步树立全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级世界观，彻底挖掉修正主义的根子。
    京剧演员杜近芳说，她过去总是喜欢演主角，甚至连别人演过的戏都不愿演。因此当领导上分配她在《红灯记》中演乙字铁梅时，这种个人名利思想就同革命需要发生了尖锐的矛盾；当时周围一些认为“演乙字角色真傻”的议论，也助长了她的思想波动。杜近芳带着这个问题，重新学习了《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》。
　　她逐步认识到：演甲字角、乙字角同样是干革命；能够战胜个人名利思想，演好乙字角，正是我走向聪明的开始，怎能说是“傻”？正是这种“要演革命戏，先做革命人”的思想和决心，推动杜近芳同甲字演员认真地互学互帮，更好地塑造了李铁梅的英雄形象；并且促使她走出剧院，到风砂扑面的广场上为农民演出。不久以前，她在某医院深入生活时，还根据毛主席“救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义”的教导，放下名演员的架子，耐心地为病人服务并说唱《红灯记》，病人称她是毛主席派来的好同志。杜近芳从这个时期的思想改造中取得的一项经验是：思想上的敌人也是不打不倒的，对待个人主义决不能以守为主，“我”字一冒头就要主动进攻。
    北京芭蕾舞学校教师肖苏华也有着同样的体会。他过去曾经错误地认为：我一不反党，二不反对社会主义，有“一点”个人主义在所“难免”。在学习毛主席著作过程中，肖苏华以雷锋为榜样对照自己，总结了个人主义思想的教训，终于弄清楚：全心全意为人民服务同个人主义是水火不相容的。他说：把所谓“小”个人主义合法化，就等于在头脑中安上了“定时炸弹”。这以后，肖苏华的精神面貌变了，他不仅克服了不安心教学工作的思想，还由于为伤病员输血而受到表扬。
    象这样的事例，在文化部和所属单位中还可以找出很多。一些家庭出身好的文艺工作者去掉了“自来红”、“差不多”的盲目性，加强了思想改造的自觉性；有些剥削阶级家庭出身的人，更彻底地同自己的家庭、阶级划清了思想界限，立志做无产阶级的文艺战士；一位受资产阶级思想影响较深的美术工作者，主动批判了不关心集体、一心搞个人创作的“自留地”、追求稿酬的错误思想，决心走出个人主义的小天地，把精力全部用到革命工作上。他深有感触地说，“思想战线上是没有假期的”，今后自己要坚持学习毛主席著作，坚决同资产阶级思想斗争到底。
    要改造世界观，必须自觉地把学习毛主席著作同深入工农兵、学习工农兵结合起来
    毛主席说：“知识分子如果同工农群众结合，和他们做了朋友，就可以把他们从书本上学来的马克思主义变成自己的东西。学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”许多文艺工作者从自己深入工农群众、改造思想的实践中，愈来愈深刻地认识到毛主席这个指示的重大意义。
    中国戏曲研究院去山西绛县南柳大队蹲点的三位青年创作干部，由于在同南柳的劳动人民和这个大队的前党支部书记周明山共同劳动中一起活学活用毛主席著作，在革命化劳动化的道路上取得了较快的进步。这个蹲点小组的一个主要学习经验是：思想改造决定于内因。他们认为，和工农群众结合，只是一般地做到同吃同住同劳动还不够，更重要的是必须做到“同心”，这就必须自觉地把学习毛主席著作和学习劳动人民结合起来。这三个青年创作干部在深入生活中并没有满足于通过“劳动关”，而是进一步用和贫农下中农同呼吸共命运的高标准要求自己。他们经常注意毛主席是怎么讲的，群众是怎么做的，而自己又是怎么想、怎么做的，不断找差距，在改造思想感情的征途中“步步登高”，因此开始能够做到喜群众之所喜，忧群众之所忧，把队里的事当成自己的事。后来，这几个年青人以小组长王安魁为首，都参加了生产队的工作，被社员们当作知心人。中国青年艺术剧院去大庆的创作小组总结同工人结合的经验时也指出，他们开始一个阶段所以深不下去、写不好，主要是由于有些人把参加劳动当做是将来写剧本获取个人名利的“资本”。他们在学习毛主席著作过程中，批判了这种错误思想，全心全意同工人结合，老老实实地做工人的小学生。他们不仅在劳动锻炼、改造思想中拜工人作老师，在创作中也拜工人作老师。经过长期的反复修改，终于为话剧《石油凯歌》的创作打下了较好的思想和生活基础。
    许多文艺工作者们都用“雪中送炭，火暖自身”，以及“如鱼得水”、“井底蛙跳出了井口”等等亲切的语言，来形容他们深入工农兵生活以后尝到的甜头，更深刻地领会到毛主席所指示的，工农兵的斗争生活是文艺创作的唯一的源泉的真理。北京电影制片厂《红色背篓》摄制组全体人员，用“学背篓，演背篓”的决心，带着毛主席著作，背起摄影器材和商品，同背篓商店的售货员一起爬山送货，共同生活，集体创作。红色售货员们全心全意为人民的革命精神，鼓舞着剧作者蹲在墙边、以膝作“桌”，满腔激情地写出了赞颂背篓精神的主题歌；也正是售货员们那种吃大苦、耐大劳的革命毅力，激励着创作人员们打破常规，用革命办法又快又好地拍出了这部影片。这个摄制组的创作实践表明，只有听毛主席的话，亲自参加群众的革命斗争，“和工农兵大众的思想感情打成一片”，才有资格做群众的代言人。
    是否领会了毛泽东思想，还要看能不能用思想改造的成果来指导工作实践，把改造主观世界同改造客观世界结合起来，坚决用政治统帅业务
    许多人在谈到学习体会时还指出，是否领会了毛主席思想，还要看能不能用思想改造的成果来指导工作实践，把改造主观世界同改造客观世界结合起来，坚决用政治来统帅业务。正在探索外来艺术形式革命化、民族化、群众化的中央乐团，在这个问题上感受得比较亲切。这个乐团的交响乐队，为了使交响乐更好地为工农兵服务，一年来根据毛主席的“外为中用”、“古为今用”的教导，创作和演出了京剧清唱《沙家浜》、《革命歌曲大联奏》等具有民族风格的革命的现代题材交响乐作品，受到工农兵的好评。在创作《革命歌曲大联奏》这个交响乐过程中，为了反映群众庆祝中华人民共和国成立的欢腾情绪，作者打破框框增加了用人声欢呼《毛主席万岁》的一段。这时有人赞成，有人认为“不大符合交响乐的艺术规律”。可是，演出以后工农兵听众却十分激动，纷纷说：“这句口号加得好”、“喊出了我们的心里话”。为什么自己的看法同工农兵有这么大的差距？交响乐队人员从这生动的一课中认识到，问题首先不在于什么艺术规律，而是自己和工农兵之间缺少共同语言。这个乐团的花腔女高音独唱演员孙家馨在学习河北梆子、探索土洋结合新唱法的过程中，也遇到过嗓音可能失声、不能再唱花腔的严重考验。这时，她便用毛主席说的“往往有这种情形，有利的情况和主动的恢复，产生于‘再坚持一下’的努力之中”这句话来鼓舞自己，坚决扫除个人杂念，抱着即使自己失败也要为别人取得经验的革命态度，大胆而扎实地投入艰苦的练习。结果，她两次胜利地度过“失声”关，既没唱坏嗓子，又学到了新本领，为创造土洋结合的花腔新唱法提供了有利条件。这次突出政治的业务实验，大大增强了孙家馨的革命勇气。她说：只要按照毛主席指示办事，心中时刻想着工农兵，战略上藐视困难，战术上重视困难，就一定无往而不胜。
    文化部和所属单位学习毛主席著作已经形成为一个群众性运动。它不仅促使各个单位在思想上工作上出现了新的面貌，对于改进工作作风，促进文艺队伍的团结，以至树立艰苦朴素的生活作风，也都发生着愈来愈深刻的影响。目前，各文艺单位正在结合学习县委书记的榜样焦裕禄的革命精神，把学习毛主席著作推向一个新的高潮。在中共文化部党委领导下，各单位都在树先进，找差距，克服学习上的不平衡现象，进一步提高为革命而学习的自觉性，健全学习制度，特别是狠抓领导干部的学习和活学活用这两个重要方面，以便引导这个群众性的学习运动更广泛、持久、深入踏实地向前发展。
