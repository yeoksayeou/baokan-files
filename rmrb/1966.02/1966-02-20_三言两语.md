    Brief Comments
    Repeating the Same Mistakes
    Johnson and his ilk have recently been strenuously touting the so-called "pacification plan" in the rural areas of South Vietnam. However, even "U.S. News & World Report" magazine has expressed doubt about this scheme of theirs. This mouthpiece of Wall Street pointed out: "Past plans for pacifying rural areas have had bitter experiences."
    In fact, Johnson is not unaware of this. The problem is that, in the years of the war of aggression against Vietnam, there has been no aspect of the experience that has not been bitter. When a person is at the end of their rope, what other choice do they have but to repeat the same mistakes?
    Delivering Goods to the Door
    According to the "New York Times," "Forty percent of all materials unloaded at Vietnamese ports and approximately thirty-six percent of supplies in military stores ended up in the hands of the guerrillas."
    Delivering goods to the door from thousands of miles away, Westmoreland is truly a rather good "transportation captain" for the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces. It turns out that the United States has been supplying the material needs of both sides, which is no wonder it is exhausted in transportation.

    三言两语
    重蹈覆辙
    约翰逊之流最近竭力吹嘘在南越农村实行所谓“绥靖计划”。但是，他们的这一套玩艺儿，连《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志也表示怀疑。这家华尔街的喉舌指出：“过去搞的绥靖农村地区的计划有着辛酸的经验”。
    其实，关于这一点，约翰逊并不是不知道的。问题是，美国在几年侵越战争中，没有哪一方面的经验不是辛酸的。当一个人走投无路的时候，除了重蹈覆辙之外，又有什么办法呢？
    送货上门
    据《纽约时报》报道，美国“在越南港口卸下的所有物资中的百分之四十以及军中商店供应品中大约百分之三十六都到了游击队手里。”
    不远千里地送货上门，威斯特摩兰真是南越人民武装力量的一位颇为不坏的“运输大队长”。原来美国一直在供应敌我双方的物资需要，这就难怪它在运输上疲于奔命了。
