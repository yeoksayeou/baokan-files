    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 4th. The change in people's thinking and the adoption of corresponding measures can quickly transform millet, a crop considered low-yield, from low-yield to high-yield. The recently held 1965 National Scientific Summary Conference on Millet High-Yield Technology proved this with a wealth of facts.
    In previous years, Jinzhuang Brigade of Jinzhuang Commune in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, believed that millet was a low-yield crop. In order to increase total grain output, they adopted the method of planting less millet and more corn. As a result, the total grain output did not increase significantly, but instead caused a shortage of millet for people and a shortage of fodder for livestock. The brigade realized this problem in 1962. In order to expand the millet planting area and ensure high millet yields, they organized commune members to conduct a major discussion in the winter of that year on how to increase millet yields. Through the discussion, everyone realized that the past low yields of millet were mainly due to insufficient fertilization, lack of careful management, and lack of hard work in planting. After finding the reason, everyone established the confidence to grow millet well and achieve high yields, rationally arranged the proportion of millet planting, and actively reformed millet cultivation techniques. As a result, not only did the average per-mu yield of millet steadily increase from the original 398 jin to more than 600 jin, but the total grain output also increased year by year, and the number of livestock and poultry also increased rapidly.
    Before 1961, the average per-mu yield of millet in Miyun County, Beijing, was relatively low. After the cadres reversed the incorrect understanding that millet was a low-yield crop, they mobilized commune members to find the reasons and propose measures. By 1965, the average per-mu yield of millet in the county's 70,000 mu of land reached 451 jin, double the previous yield.
    In Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, where the frost-free period is only 120 days, the average per-mu yield of millet used to be only 143 jin. Since 1964, the leading cadres of this county have changed their past practice of not attaching importance to millet crops. In accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on "concentrating superior forces to fight a battle of annihilation," they focused on millet as a key point, went deep into communes and brigades to stay, established models, and summarized and promoted the experience of increasing millet production. By 1965, the average per-mu yield of millet in the county's more than 110,000 mu of land was 200 jin, an increase of more than 40 percent compared to 1964.
    The conference, through a large number of facts such as those mentioned above, pointed out the importance of human factors. The conference believes that millet has the characteristics of being drought-resistant and barren-resistant. Arranging it on dry and barren land reflects the side of people mastering and adapting to objective laws; however, if one only knows how to adapt and does not transform barren soil, and does not change the habit of extensive cultivation and management, the low-yield appearance of millet can never be changed. The participants of the conference believed that the key to transforming low-yield millet into high-yield millet is to emphasize politics, give full play to people's subjective initiative, actively carry out farmland capital construction according to local conditions, summarize and promote the advanced millet planting experience in various places, and put in hard work in "management" in order to win a comprehensive and great harvest of millet.
    Millet occupies an important position in agricultural production in northern China. In provinces and regions such as Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, the millet planting area generally accounts for 15 to 20 percent of the local grain crop area. Millet has high nutritional value and is suitable for storage. It is a staple food loved by urban and rural people; millet bran and millet straw are the main feed for developing collective animal husbandry and raising pigs and poultry by commune members. The conference believes that in the years of revolutionary war, we relied on "millet plus rifles" to defeat enemies at home and abroad; in the future, increasing millet production will still be of great significance in China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    This conference was commissioned by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and hosted by the Academy of Agricultural Sciences of Shanxi, Hebei, and Heilongjiang provinces in Harbin. The participants included agricultural scientific personnel from eleven northern provinces and autonomous regions, including Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Ningxia, and Heilongjiang.

### 变谷子低产为高产的关键何在？  突出政治，发挥人的能动作用  全国谷子丰产技术经验科学总结会议讨论谷子生产问题

    变谷子低产为高产的关键何在？
    突出政治，发挥人的能动作用
    全国谷子丰产技术经验科学总结会议讨论谷子生产问题
    新华社哈尔滨四日电　人的思想变了，采取了相应的措施，被认为是低产作物的谷子，就能够很快地改变低产面貌。最近举行的一九六五年全国谷子丰产技术经验科学总结会议，以大量的事实证明了这一点。
    前几年，山西省壶关县晋庄公社晋庄大队曾经认为谷子是低产作物，为了提高粮食总产量，便采取了少种谷子多种玉米的办法。结果粮食总产量并没有显著提高，反而造成人缺小米、畜缺饲草的现象。这个大队在一九六二年觉察到了这个问题，他们为了扩大谷子种植面积和保证谷子高产，当年冬天，组织社员就如何提高谷子产量问题，开展了一次大讨论。通过讨论，大家认识到过去谷子低产，主要是因为不多施肥，不精心管理，种植上没下苦功夫。原因找到以后，大家树立了种好谷子、让谷子高产的信心，合理安排了谷子的种植比例，积极改革谷子的栽培技术。结果，不仅谷子平均亩产量由原来的三百九十八斤，逐年稳步上升到六百斤以上，而且粮食总产量也逐年提高，畜禽也增加得很快。
    北京市密云县一九六一年以前，谷子平均亩产量较低。干部扭转了谷子是低产作物的不正确认识以后，发动社员找原因，提措施，到一九六五年，这个县七万亩谷子平均亩产量就达到四百五十一斤，比以前增产一倍。
    无霜期只有一百二十天的黑龙江省桦川县，过去谷子平均亩产量只有一百四十三斤。这个县的领导干部从一九六四年改变了过去不重视谷子作物的做法，按照毛主席“集中优势兵力打歼灭战”的指示精神，把谷子作为重点，深入社队蹲点，树立样板，总结和推广谷子增产经验，到一九六五年，全县十一万多亩谷子，平均亩产二百斤，比一九六四年增产百分之四十多。
    会议通过诸如上述的大量事实，指出了人的因素的重要性。会议认为，谷子具有耐旱耐瘠薄的特性。把它安排在旱、薄地上，这体现了人们掌握与适应客观规律的一面；但是，假若只知道适应，而不改造瘠薄土壤，不改变耕作管理粗放的习惯，谷子低产的面貌便永远不能改变。参加会议的人员认为，变谷子低产为高产的关键，是突出政治，充分发挥人的主观能动性，针对影响谷子产量的主要问题，积极地因地制宜地大搞农田基本建设，总结与推广各地先进种谷经验，在“管”字上下苦功，来赢得谷子全面大丰收。
    谷子在我国北方的农业生产中占有重要的位置。河北、内蒙古、山西、吉林、黑龙江等省、区，谷子种植面积一般都占当地粮食作物面积的百分之十五到二十。小米的营养价值高，适于储藏，是城乡人民喜爱的口粮；谷糠和谷草是发展集体畜牧业和社员养猪养禽的主要饲料。会议认为，在革命战争年代，我们靠“小米加步枪”战胜了国内外敌人；今后在我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，增产谷子仍然具有十分重要的意义。
    这次会议是中国农业科学院委托山西、河北、黑龙江三省农业科学院主持在哈尔滨召开的。参加会议的有山西、河北、山东、河南、陕西、甘肃、内蒙古、辽宁、吉林、宁夏、黑龙江等北方十一个省、自治区的农业科学人员。
