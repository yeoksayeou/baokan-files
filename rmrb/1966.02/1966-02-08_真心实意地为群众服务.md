    I used to be a cadre in the Construction Department of the Shimensibestos Mine. In January 1961, the organization assigned me to the No. 1 Quarry 1313 work section as a worker, concurrently serving as the secretary of the work section Party branch. At that time, the problems in this section were "three lows" (low attendance rate, low work-hour utilization, low efficiency) and "three highs" (high number of sick people, high consumption of raw materials, high number of accidents), often failing to complete the state plan. Despite criticisms in large and small meetings, some people still didn't come to work. What was the reason? The next day, I put on my work clothes and went into the pit to push carts with the workers. Most of the carts were broken, making it very difficult to push them. In the pit, there were two places without waterproofing equipment, constantly leaking water like a rainy day. The drainage ditches were also broken, and some of the railways were flooded. After a day's work, my clothes and socks were completely soaked, and I felt sore all over, even finding it difficult to go down the mountain. From the practical experience of participating in labor myself, I realized that it wasn't that the masses were mischievous, faking illness, and unwilling to work, or unwilling to work hard to complete the state plan, but that the masses did indeed have practical difficulties in production and life, and our leaders had not cared for them, empathized with them, or helped them solve them.
    After discovering this problem, I immediately convened a branch committee, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's article "Concern Ourselves with the Well-Being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work," and carried out criticism and self-criticism, examining our leadership's bureaucratic style of not caring about the masses' lives. Afterwards, the work section chief, technician, and I organized everyone to dredge the drainage ditches, repair the mine cars, and build waterproofing equipment in the leaking areas. After a week of hard work, we solved the problems of excessive water underground and poor working conditions. Later, we suggested that the administration fix a dedicated person to clean the drainage ditches and repair the cars every day, overcoming the past phenomena of excessive water, chaotic piles of pit props, materials, tools, and ore, and frequent work-related injuries, so that civilized production was realized in the pit. The workers reflected, "As long as the leadership can care for us and empathize with us like this, what else can we say? We must do our best to complete the task." In March, the section's attendance rate increased from 80% in January and February to 90.3%, and work hours and efficiency also greatly improved, exceeding the full month's state plan by 29%.
    After the masses' enthusiasm was aroused, where should I, as a branch secretary, focus my work? I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policy instructions with this question in mind. The Party teaches us: the more enthusiastic the masses are, the more we must care about their lives. While studying, I thought of when I was a worker in 1955. I suffered from rheumatic arthritis and was sick in bed for six or seven days. My comrades had all gone to work, and I couldn't even get a drink of water myself, and only waited until my comrades returned from work to get water. At that time, I felt that when I was working, the leaders and comrades all praised me, but when I was sick, no one paid attention to me. The more I thought about it, the more I couldn't understand it, and I cried several times in anger, even wanting to resign and go home. Now that I have become a branch secretary, the Party and the higher authorities have entrusted me with hundreds of worker brothers. I must listen to the Party's words, care about the masses' pain, and wholeheartedly serve my class brothers! From then on, every morning as soon as I got up, I carried wash water and boiling water, and went to each room to give wash water and boiling water to the sick comrades, comforting them to take good care of themselves. Then, I would ask for a doctor, get medicine, and deliver meals. In this way, the sick comrades all felt warm. Their enthusiasm for production was further mobilized. After I did this, the work section chief, the work section trade union chairman, the Party group leaders, and the production team leaders also followed suit.
    From the practice of delivering meals to the sick every day, I gradually discovered this rule: there were more sick people in July and August, and colds and flu were the most common among those who fell ill. After investigation, it turned out that some people were greedy for coolness at night, didn't cover themselves with quilts, and didn't put up mosquito nets; others didn't go to bed on time at night. Therefore, every night I went to the rooms to check the bedding. I realized that checking the bedding was not only caring about the masses' lives, but also being able to discover the masses' living thoughts in time, and doing political and ideological work in time. Once, at two o'clock in the morning, I went to check the bedding and found that the worker Chen Wenxue was tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep. I talked to him and found out that he was worried that because of his landlord family background, the leaders and the masses had different views of him. I explained in detail to him the Party's policy of emphasizing performance, making it clear that although his family background was not good, as long as he listened to the Party, followed the Party, drew a clear line with the landlord family ideologically, and worked hard in production, he had a future. After the conversation and education, his mind was settled and he worked actively.

    真心实意地为群众服务
    四川石棉矿基建处工程队党支部书记　林禄才
    我原在石棉矿当干部，一九六一年一月，组织上把我下放到一采场一三一三工段当工人，兼工段党支部书记。当时，这个段存在的问题是“三低”（出勤率低、工时利用低、工效低）、“三多”（病号多、原材料消耗多、事故多），经常完不成国家计划。尽管大会小会批评，有些人还是不上工，什么原因呢？第二天，我换上工作服，进坑和工人一起推车。车子大部分是坏的，推起来很费劲。坑内有两个地方，没有防水设备，不断地漏水，象落雨天一样。排水沟也烂，有的铁道都被淹没了。劳动一天下来，衣服鞋袜全被淋湿，周身酸痛，连下山都感到困难。从亲身参加劳动的实践中，我才体会到并不是群众调皮装病不愿意上工，不努力完成国家计划，而是群众生产上、生活上的确存在着实际困难，我们领导没有去关心体贴，帮助解决。
    发现这个问题后，我立即召开了支部委员会，组织大家学习了毛主席《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》这篇文章，开展了批评与自我批评，检查了我们领导上不关心群众生活的官僚主义作风。会后，我和工段长、技术员就组织大家疏通排水沟，修理矿车，在漏水地方修建防水设备。经过一周奋战，解决了井下水大、劳动条件差的问题。以后又建议行政固定专人每天打扫排水沟，修车子，克服了过去水大，坑木、材料、工具、矿石乱堆乱放，经常发生工伤事故的现象，使坑内实现了文明生产。工人们反映说：“只要领导上能够这样关心体贴我们，我们还有什么说的，一定要尽最大力量完成任务。”三月份全段出勤率由一二月份的百分之八十，提高到百分之九十点三，工时和工效也大大提高，超额百分之二十九完成了全月国家计划。
    群众干劲起来以后，我身为一个支部书记，又应该把自己工作的重点放在什么地方呢？我带着这个问题反复学习毛主席著作和党的政策指示。党教导我们：群众干劲越大，越要关心群众生活。我一边学，一边想，想起一九五五年自己当工人，患了风湿性关节炎，病倒在床六七天，同志们都上工去了，自己想喝口水都喝不上，只有等同志们收工回来才能喝上水。当时觉得干活的时候，领导和同志们都说好，病了便没人理睬，越想越不通，气得哭了好几场，甚至想退职回家。现在，自己担任了支部书记，党和上级把几百个工人弟兄交给我，我可要好好听党的话，关心群众的痛痒，真心实意地为阶级兄弟服务啊！从此，我每天清早一起床，就提着洗脸水、开水，到每间工房走一转，给生病的同志倒洗脸水、开水，安慰他们好好养病，然后又给请医生、拿药、送饭，这样，生病的同志都感到温暖。他们的生产积极性进一步调动起来了。我这样做了以后，工段长、工段工会主席和党小组长、生产班长等也都跟着做。
    从每天送病号饭的实践中，我逐步摸到了这样一条规律：就是七、八月份的病号多，发病的人当中又是伤风感冒较多。经过调查，原来是有的人晚上贪凉，不盖被子，不放蚊帐；有的人晚上不按时睡觉。于是，我每天晚上便到工房查铺盖被。我体会到，查铺盖被，不仅是关心群众生活，而且可以及时发现群众的活思想，及时做政治思想工作。有一次，我晚上两点钟去查铺，发现工人陈文学在床上翻来复去睡不着觉，我就找他谈话，原来他顾虑自己家庭成份是地主，领导和群众对自己看法不一样。我便详细地向他交代了党的重在表现的政策，讲明虽然家庭出身不好，但只要好好听党的话，跟着党走，从思想上和地主家庭划清界限，努力生产工作，是有前途的。经过谈话教育以后，他思想安定了，工作也积极了。
