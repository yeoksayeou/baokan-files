    American President Johnson, in his State of the Union address this year, boasted about promoting a so-called "Great Society" program to "enrich the content of American life." To see just how "rich" the social life in America is, one only needs to look at Washington, the U.S. capital city where Johnson resides. Below is an excerpt from an article about rampant crime in Washington written by American journalist Miriam Ottenberg:
    Today, your chances of being robbed in Washington are three times greater than in 1958—greater than in any other city of comparable size in the country.
    Your home, shop, or office is also three times more likely to be burglarized in Washington than in 1958.
    In Washington, serious crimes ranging from armed robbery to murder have reached unprecedented levels. The result is:
    ——Some newly built apartments have already installed concealed cameras at each entrance to film closed-circuit television, so that thieves can be detected immediately.
    ——Some nurses and other people who work the night shift are currently taking self-defense courses at the YMCA.
    ——A company that sells burglar alarms reports that its business in Washington has increased by 75 percent in the past five years.
    ——One company that sells tear gas pens says it can sell two thousand of its pen-shaped guns per week in Washington, and another company reports that its products sell five hundred units per week.
    Random, brutal acts of violence are increasingly becoming a common practice for muggers and robbers.
    A seventy-four-year-old woman was getting into her relative's car when she was suddenly confronted by a mugger. She kept humming, "No, no." Each time she hummed, the mugger struck her in the face with the butt of his gun. A robber who robbed a store on East Capitol Street saw a customer and shot him. Several shop owners were shot after they handed over the money to the robbers.
    In the past, robbers often chose to rob stores at night, shortly before closing, when there were few customers. Now, they rob stores day and night, often when there are a dozen or so customers inside.
    Among cities with a population of 500,000 to 1 million, Washington has seen a soaring crime rate. In 1958, thirteen out of every thousand residents in the Washington area were victims of serious crimes. In 1964, this number rose to twenty-eight.

    一个美国记者笔下的华盛顿
    美国总统约翰逊在今年的国情咨文中大肆吹嘘，要推行所谓“伟大的社会”计划来“丰富美国生活的内容”。美国的社会生活究竟有多么“丰富”，只要看看约翰逊所在的美国首都华盛顿的情形就可以知道了。下面是美国记者密里安·奥坦布格所写的一篇关于华盛顿盗匪横行的报道的摘要：
    今天，你在华盛顿受到抢劫的可能性比一九五八年大了三倍——大于这个国家中任何一个差不多规模的城市。
    你的家、你的铺子或你的写字间遭到夜盗破门而入的可能性在华盛顿也比一九五八年大了三倍。
    在华盛顿，从持枪抢劫到谋杀的严重犯罪行为已达到了空前的纪录。结果是：
    ——一些新建的公寓已经在各个入口处装上隐蔽的摄影机拍摄闭合电路电视，以便一有小偷就立即发觉。
    ——有些护士和其他做夜班的人目前在青年会学习自卫课程
    ——一家出售防盗警报器的公司报告说，它在华盛顿的买卖过去五年中增加了百分之七十五。
    ——有一家出售催泪瓦斯笔的公司说，它的笔形枪在华盛顿每周可以卖出两千支，另一家公司报告说它的产品每周可以售出五百支。
    随便的、残酷的暴力行为，愈来愈成为拦路贼、抢劫犯的常见方式。
    一个七十四岁的老妇人进入她的亲戚的汽车时，突然遇到一名拦路贼。她不断地哼着说，“不，不。”每哼一声，拦路贼就用枪柄击打她的面颊一次。一个抢犯抢了国会东街一家商店，他瞥见一名顾客，就射杀了他。有几个商店的店主是在他们把钱交给抢犯以后被射杀的。
    从前，强盗们往往选择晚上商店快关门以前顾客稀少的时候进行抢劫。现在，他们不分昼夜，往往商店里还有十来名顾客的时候就进店行劫。
    在人口为五十万到一百万名的城市中，华盛顿的犯罪事件扶摇直上。一九五八年，华盛顿区每一千居民中，有十三个人是严重犯罪行为的受害者，一九六四年，这个数字上升为二十八人。
