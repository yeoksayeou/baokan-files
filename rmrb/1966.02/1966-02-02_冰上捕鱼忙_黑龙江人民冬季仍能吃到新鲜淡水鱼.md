    Busy Ice Fishing
    Heilongjiang People Can Still Eat Fresh Freshwater Fish in Winter
    (Xinhua News Agency, Harbin) The broad masses of people living in the cities and countryside of Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost part of our country, can still eat fresh freshwater fish during the long winter. This is the result of the province's many fishermen persisting in fishing on the ice.
    In Heilongjiang Province, from early December to the end of March of the following year, the rivers are frozen with two to three feet of ice. This is the golden season for ice fishing. The province's annual winter fish catch accounts for more than half of the total annual catch.
    After the rivers froze last year, more than 20,000 state-owned fish farm workers and commune members along the rivers and lakes in the province went to break the ice and fish on the vast ice surfaces of the Heilongjiang River, Songhua River, Nen River, Wusuli River, Mudan River, Xingkai Lake, Jingpo Lake, Lianhuan Lake, and others. The freshly caught fish are frozen and immediately loaded onto trucks for transport to supply the people in the cities and countryside.
    The migratory patterns of fish in winter are different from those in summer. After the rivers freeze, it is only possible to judge the fish situation on the ice. However, the fishermen of Heilongjiang Province, who have rich experience in ice fishing, can determine the concentration of fish schools based on natural phenomena such as the climate at the time of the freeze and the ice surface after the freeze. In the first ten days or so of ice fishing this year, the Jiangmian area where the Shiren Gou Aquatic Product Breeding Farm on the Nen River is located had an average catch of over 10,000 jin per net.
    In the past, Heilongjiang Province fishermen mostly fished on the ice by blocking the mouths of the river branches during the summer and autumn when the river water rose, leaving fish and water in the river branches that were higher than the river water, and then breaking the ice and releasing the water in winter to catch the fish left in the river branches. This method was only suitable for small-scale fishing. Now, many places use the ice-pull net fishing method. After the rivers are frozen, fishery workers or commune members drill holes in the ice to set the nets. These nets generally have more than fifty pieces and are more than two hundred and fifty zhang long. Then, tractors are used to winch the nets and fish together onto the ice surface. This type of net has a large catch volume, sometimes more than 200,000 jin per net, and generally about 10,000 jin per net.

### 冰上捕鱼忙  黑龙江人民冬季仍能吃到新鲜淡水鱼

    冰上捕鱼忙
    黑龙江人民冬季仍能吃到新鲜淡水鱼
    据新华社哈尔滨电　生活在我国最北部的黑龙江省广大城乡人民，在漫长的冬季里，仍能吃到新鲜的淡水鱼。这是这个省的广大渔民坚持在冰上捕鱼的结果。
    黑龙江省每年从十二月初到第二年三月末，江河上都结有两三尺厚的冰层。这时，正是冰上捕鱼的黄金季节，全省每年冬季捕鱼量约占全年捕鱼量的一半以上。
    去年江河封冻以后，全省沿江沿湖的两万多名国营渔场渔业工人和公社的社员，就分别在黑龙江、松花江、嫩江、乌苏里江、牡丹江、兴凯湖、镜泊湖、连环湖等辽阔的冰面上破冰捕鱼。刚捕获的鲜鱼，冰冻以后，立即装车外运，供应城乡人民食用。
    冬季鱼类的回游规律和夏季不同，封江后只能在冰面上判断鱼情。可是有丰富冰上捕鱼经验的黑龙江省渔民，却能根据封江时的气候、封江后的冰面等自然现象，确定鱼群的集中地。嫩江边的石人沟水产养殖场所在的江面，今年冰上捕鱼开始的头十多天里，平均每网捕鱼上万斤。
    以前，黑龙江省渔民冰上捕鱼，大都是在夏、秋两季江水上涨时，把江汊口堵住，使鱼和水留在比江水高的江汊里，冬季再破冰放水，把留在江汊里的鱼捕捞上来。这一方法只适于小量捕鱼。现在很多地方使用冰下拉网捕鱼法。当江河封冻后，渔业工人或社员便在冰上钻孔下网，这种网一般有五十多片，长二百五十多丈，然后用拖拉机把网和鱼一起绞上冰面。这种网捕捞量大，有时一网可捞二十多万斤，一般每网可捞一万斤左右。
