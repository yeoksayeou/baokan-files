    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, February 17th -- According to a Pathet Lao Radio broadcast: General Phoun Sipaseuth, representative of the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army and head of the Lao Patriotic Front delegation in the Lao Tripartite Joint Ceasefire Commission, issued a statement on the 15th, strongly condemning and protesting the frenzied attack launched by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against the Phou Kout region of the Plain of Jars.

    The statement said that just as U.S. imperialism is making every effort to prepare to send U.S. troops to directly occupy central and lower Laos, it has, since February 4th, dispatched ten battalions of Kong Le's troops and right-wing troops, as well as some Thai troops and many aircraft taking off from Thai bases, to launch a large-scale attack on Phou Kout, firing and dropping tons of shells and bombs on the area.

    The statement pointed out that this attack is being carried out simultaneously with the large-scale offensives of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against central and lower Laos. All these actions by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to attack Phou Kout and central and lower Laos are part of the U.S. plan to intensify the special war in Laos and attempt to create a serious situation to put pressure on Prince Souvanna Phouma in order to realize its conspiracy to send U.S. troops directly into Laos.

    In addition, this is also a new step in the U.S. and its lackeys' plan to annex Kong Le's troops and an extremely dangerous step in the Kong Le group's conspiracy to sell soldiers' lives cheaply in exchange for U.S. dollars.

    The statement sternly warned U.S. imperialism and its lackeys that they must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by their military adventures. Prince Souvanna Phouma and the heads of Kong Le's troops, who allow U.S. imperialism and its lackey clique to use their forces to participate in expanding the war of aggression, must also bear serious responsibility.

    The statement called on the soldiers of the Kong Le troops to see through the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism, not to serve as its cannon fodder, to resolutely rise up against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and to defend their lives and strength.

    The statement solemnly declared that if U.S. imperialism and its lackeys stubbornly continue to launch attacks, disregarding the warnings of the Lao patriotic forces, then the Lao People's Liberation Army, the patriotic neutral forces, and the people of the Plain of Jars region of Xieng Khouang Province will resolutely give them the punishment they deserve and are determined to defend every inch of the liberated area.

    Pathet Lao Radio published a commentary on the 17th, pointing out that the Lao Patriotic Front has consistently made unremitting efforts to peacefully resolve the Lao issue. However, the Lao Patriotic Front and the patriotic neutral forces will never allow any enemy to occupy the land of their liberated area.

    Phou Kout is a position of the Lao patriotic forces. When Phou Kout is attacked by Kong Le's troops held hostage by U.S. imperialism and the right wing, the Lao patriotic forces will fight back with their legitimate right of self-defense and completely annihilate them.

    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, February 16th -- According to a Pathet Lao Radio broadcast: A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on the 14th, pointing out that U.S. Vice President Humphrey's activities in Vientiane are to instruct the Vientiane puppet clique to realize U.S. imperialism's new military adventures in Laos and to promote its plan to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to the entire Indochina.

    The statement pointed out that just as U.S. imperialism is instigating the Sananikone-Kouprasith group and Kong Le to dispatch approximately ten battalions of troops and Thai troops to attack Phou Kout and the Plain of Jars, and preparing to send troops directly to invade the liberated areas of central and lower Laos, Humphrey's activities in Vientiane are to interfere in Laos' internal affairs and make the already tense situation in Laos even more tense.

    It said that this is an illegal action by U.S. imperialism to further strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Laos.

    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, February 17th -- According to a Pathet Lao Radio broadcast on the 17th: The patriotic armed forces in the Phou Kout region of Laos bravely fought back against invading U.S. air bandits in two battles on the 11th and 12th, shooting down three U.S. aircraft and damaging four.

    西巴色将军谴责美帝及其走狗进攻富科特山地区
    老挝爱国军民坚决打击来犯敌人
    爱国战线党中央发言人揭露汉弗莱到万象策划扩大侵略阴谋
    新华社康开十七日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝人民解放军最高指挥部代表、老挝三方联合停火委员会中的老挝爱国战线党代表团团长奔·西巴色将军十五日发表声明，强烈谴责和抗议美帝国主义及其走狗向查尔平原的富科特山地区发动猖狂进攻。
    声明说，正当美帝国主义竭力准备派遣美国陆军直接占领老挝中寮和下寮地区的时候，它从二月四日以来派遣了十个营的贡勒方面的军队和右派军队，以及部分泰国军队和从泰国基地起飞的许多飞机，向富科特山发动了大规模进攻，并向这个地区发射和投下数以吨计的炮弹和炸弹。
    声明指出，这次进攻是同美帝国主义及其走狗向中寮和下寮地区的大规模进攻同时进行的。美帝国主义及其走狗进攻富科特山地区和中、下寮的这一切行动，都是美国强化在老挝的特种战争计划的组成部分，并且妄图制造严重局势，对梭发那·富马亲王施加压力，以实现它直接派遣美国陆军进入老挝的阴谋。
    此外，这也是美国及其走狗策划吞并贡勒方面军队的计划中的新的一步，也是贡勒集团廉价出卖士兵生命换取美元阴谋中极其危险的一步。
    声明严厉警告美帝国主义及其走狗必须对由于它们的军事冒险行动所造成的一切后果担负全部责任。梭发那·富马亲王和贡勒方面军队的头子让美帝国主义及其走狗集团利用自己的力量参与扩大侵略战争，也必须承担严重的责任。
    声明号召贡勒部队的士兵识破美帝国主义的阴谋，不要充当它的炮灰，坚决起来反对美帝国主义及其走狗，保卫自己的生命和力量。
    声明郑重宣布，如果美帝国主义及其走狗一味顽固地继续发动进攻，无视老挝爱国力量的警告，那末，川圹省查尔平原地区老挝人民解放军、爱国中立力量和人民，必将坚决地给它们以应有的还击和惩罚，决心保卫解放区的每一寸土地。
    巴特寮电台十七日发表评论指出，老挝爱国战线党一贯为和平解决老挝问题作出不懈努力。但是，老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量决不让任何一个敌人占领自己的解放区的土地。
    富科特山是老挝爱国力量的阵地。当富科特山遭到由美帝国主义和右派挟持的贡勒军队的进攻时，老挝各爱国力量就要以自己正当的自卫权力进行反击，并且全部消灭它们。
    据新华社康开十六日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人十四日发表声明指出，美国副总统汉弗莱到万象活动是为了指使万象走狗集团实现美帝国主义在老挝的新的军事冒险，推行它把侵越战争扩大到整个印度支那的计划。
    声明指出，正当美帝国主义唆使萨纳尼空—库帕拉西集团和贡勒出动大约十营的兵力和泰国军队进攻富科特山和查尔平原，并且准备直接出兵侵占中寮和下寮解放区的时候，汉弗莱到万象进行活动是要干涉老挝内部事务，使老挝已经紧张的局势更加紧张。
    它说，这是美帝国主义进一步加强和扩大侵略老挝战争的非法行动。
    新华社康开十七日电　据巴特寮电台十七日广播：老挝富科特山地区爱国武装力量在十一和十二日两次战斗中，英勇反击入侵的美国空中强盗，击落美国飞机三架，击伤四架。
