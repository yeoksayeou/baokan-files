    Xinhua News Agency, February 7th – Lin Biao, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, today sent a telegram to General Kim Chang-bong, Minister of National Defense of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, warmly congratulating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army. The telegram reads as follows:
    To Comrade General Kim Chang-bong, Minister of National Defense of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    Dear Comrade Minister of National Defense:
    On the occasion of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the fraternal Korean People's Army, I, on behalf of the Chinese people and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extend the most lofty respect and warmest festive congratulations to the heroic Korean people and all comrades-in-arms of the Korean People's Army.
    Under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the heroic Korean People's Army has inherited and carried forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of the anti-Japanese guerrillas and the heroism of the Korean people in the great Fatherland Liberation War, and has achieved brilliant successes in strengthening the building of the army and strengthening preparedness against war. The Korean people and the Korean People's Army are building the northern half of Korea into an impregnable fighting fortress and revolutionary base. You are vigilantly guarding the eastern outpost of the socialist camp, and have waged unremitting struggles against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs – the Park Chung-hee puppet clique and the Japanese reactionaries, making significant contributions to safeguarding the socialist construction of your motherland and maintaining peace in Asia and the world.
    The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are overjoyed at every victory achieved by the fraternal Korean people and the Korean People's Army in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The Chinese people have always unswervingly and resolutely supported the Korean people's struggle for the reunification of their motherland and against the "South Korea-Japan Treaty," and resolutely supported the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S.-Park clique. We firmly believe that the Korean people will surely be able to drive all U.S. imperialists out of South Korea. The three thousand li of beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea will surely be reunited.
    We wish the Korean people and the Korean People's Army new and greater achievements in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs and in strengthening their fighting power!
    The great militant friendship between the people and armies of China and Korea, forged in blood in the long-term revolutionary struggle against our common enemy, will last forever!
                 Lin Biao
                 Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China
                            February 7, 1966, Beijing

    英雄的朝鲜人民军，在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的领导下，继承和发扬了抗日游击队的光荣革命传统和朝鲜人民在伟大的祖国解放战争中的英雄气概，在加强军队建设和加强战备的工作中取得了光辉的成就。朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军正在把朝鲜北半部建设成为铜墙铁壁般的战斗堡垒和革命基地。你们警惕地守卫在社会主义阵营的东方前哨，同美帝国主义和它的走狗——朴正熙卖国集团和日本反动派，进行了坚持不懈的斗争，对于保卫自己祖国的社会主义建设和维护亚洲和世界和平，作出了重大的贡献。
    中国人民和中国人民解放军，为兄弟的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中所取得的每一个胜利而感到欢欣鼓舞。中国人民始终不渝地坚决支持朝鲜人民争取祖国统一和反对“韩日条约”的斗争，坚决支持南朝鲜人民反对美朴集团的爱国正义斗争。我们深信，朝鲜人民一定能够把美帝国主义全部赶出南朝鲜。朝鲜三千里锦绣河山一定能够重归统一。
    祝朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军在反对美帝国主义及其走狗和加强自己的战斗威力的斗争中取得新的更大的成就！
    中朝两国人民和两国军队在反对共同敌人的长期革命斗争中用鲜血凝成的伟大战斗友谊万古长青！
