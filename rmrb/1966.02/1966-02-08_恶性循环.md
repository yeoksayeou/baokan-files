    Vicious Circle
    U.S. invading forces commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, admitted that the number of deserters in the South Vietnamese puppet army has increased. He believes this is due to the increase in the number of conscripts.
    However, Westmoreland certainly doesn't not know that one of the reasons the South Vietnamese puppet clique is stepping up conscription is because the puppet army is facing fierce attacks by the South Vietnamese people's armed forces, and the number of surrenders and deserters has increased. The South Vietnamese puppet army is heading towards complete disintegration in this vicious cycle.

    恶性循环
    侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰承认，南越伪军中开小差的人增加了，他认为这是由于征兵数目增加的原因。
    但是，威斯特摩兰当然并非不知道，南越傀儡集团加紧征兵，原因之一就是伪军面对着南越人民武装勇猛打击，投诚和开小差的人增加了。南越伪军正是在这样的恶性循环中走向彻底瓦解。
