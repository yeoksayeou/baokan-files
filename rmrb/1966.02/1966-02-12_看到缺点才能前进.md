    Only by Seeing Shortcomings Can We Move Forward
    Zhang Guoni, Lathe Operator, Shijiazhuang Vehicle Depot
    Some time ago, I thought I was a technical innovation expert, a "Five-Good" worker, and I became complacent.
    Yu Jinhu in our group is a quality pacesetter recognized by everyone, and everyone learns from him. However, I thought: his lathe is better than mine. If I worked on his lathe, I could also avoid producing defective products. Besides, even with a higher efficiency, producing some defective products is inevitable.
    Once, when I was lathing round pins, I made 210 of them, but six were substandard defective products. At the post-shift production analysis meeting, everyone praised my enthusiasm and also criticized the low quality of the products. At that time, I still thought it was nitpicking. Later, the leadership discovered this and helped me, but I felt a little overwhelmed. With this problem in mind, I studied "On Contradiction" for several nights in a row, and I discovered that my thinking had deviated from Chairman Mao's teachings. I only saw the achievements and did not see the problems, which affected my progress. If my thinking is not up to standard, then the product cannot have high quality.
    In order to resolve the contradiction of poor quality, I resolved to humbly learn from the quality pacesetter Yu Jinhu, and I actively sought him out, always carefully observing his strengths. With his help, I learned his advanced methods, and the quality was significantly improved.

    看到缺点才能前进
    石家庄车辆段旋工　张国妮
    前个时期，我认为自己是革新能手、五好职工，自己就满足了。
    我们组的于金虎，是大家公认的质量标兵，大家都向他学习。我却认为：他的床子比我的好，要是我上他那床子上干，也同样能不出次品，再说效率高点，出点次品也是难免的。
    有一次，我旋圆销子，干了二百一十个，却有六个不合规格的次品，在班后生产分析会上，大家表扬了我的干劲，同时对产品质量低也提出了批评。当时我还认为是吹毛求疵。以后领导发现了，对我进行帮助，我有点吃不住劲儿了。我带着问题，连续几个晚上学习了《矛盾论》，发现自己的思想离开了毛主席的教导，只看成绩，看不到问题，影响自己不能进步。思想不高标准，产品也就不可能有高质量。
    为了解决质量差的矛盾，自己下决心虚心向质量标兵于金虎学习，主动和他挂上钩，处处留心观察他的长处。在他的帮助下，学到了他的先进方法，质量有了显著的提高。
