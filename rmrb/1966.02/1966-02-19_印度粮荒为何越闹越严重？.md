    India suffers from famine almost every year, and it is getting worse. This is the evil consequence of the Indian government, which represents the interests of big landlords and big bourgeoisie, pursuing anti-people policies.

    Originally, India possessed sufficient labor and vast land, with a total cultivated area of 376 million acres (equivalent to 2.282 billion *shi* mu, averaging nearly 5 *shi* mu per person), and the natural conditions are also very good. However, the Indian National Congress government has consistently implemented policies that maintain the unreasonable land system and cruel feudal exploitation, allowing landlords and rich peasants, who account for 15 percent of the country's agricultural population, to occupy 85 percent of the country's cultivated land, while poor peasants and middle peasants, who account for 85 percent of the agricultural population, only occupy about 15 percent of the cultivated land. The land rent that Indian farmers are forced to pay usually accounts for half of the harvest, and some are even as high as three-quarters. At the same time, most Indian farmers also suffer from usurious exploitation with annual interest rates as high as 200 percent or more. Therefore, the vast majority of farmers have no ability or incentive to improve agricultural production. In addition, the Indian government simply does not pay attention to afforestation, flood control, and soil and water conservation, which inevitably leads to a substantial decline in India's agricultural production year after year, and the food problem is becoming increasingly serious.

    However, the Indian government does not face up to the crux of the food shortage problem, but drinks poison to quench its thirst, desperately begging foreign countries, especially the United States, for grain to survive. With the massive dumping of American grain, many farmers are forced to switch from growing grain to other crops because they cannot withstand the competition from American grain, which further deepens India's food crisis, thereby creating a vicious cycle of American grain dumping and Indian famine. As a result, India's food crisis is becoming more and more serious. (Picture attached)

### 印度粮荒为何越闹越严重？

    印度粮荒为何越闹越严重？
    印度几乎年年都闹粮荒，而且越闹越严重。这是由于代表大地主、大资产阶级利益的印度政府执行反人民政策造成的恶果。
    本来，印度拥有充足的劳动力和辽阔的土地，全国耕地面积达三亿七千六百万英亩（合二十二亿八千二百万市亩，平均每人近五市亩），自然条件也很好。但是印度国大党政府却始终实行维护不合理土地制度和残酷封建剥削的政策，使占全国农业人口百分之十五的地主和富农一直得以占有全国耕地面积的百分之八十五，而占农业人口百分之八十五的贫雇农和中农却只占有耕地的百分之十五左右。印度农民被迫缴纳的地租通常占收获物的一半，甚至有的高达四分之三。同时，大多数印度农民还遭受着年息高达百分之二百以上的高利贷盘剥。因此，广大农民根本无力也无积极性去提高农业生产。再加上印度政府根本不重视造林、防洪和水土保持等工作，这就不能不造成了印度农业生产连年大幅度下降，粮食问题日益严重。
    但是，印度政府却不正视粮荒问题的症结，饮鸩止渴，拼命向外国特别是向美国乞粮度日。在美国粮食大量倾销的情况下，由于抵挡不住美国粮食的竞争，许多农民被迫把粮田改种其它作物，这使得印度的粮食危机进一步加深，从而造成美国粮食的倾销和印度粮荒的恶性循环，结果是印度的粮食危机愈来愈严重。（附图片）
