    The rural sideline production situation in our country is excellent.
    The Rural Sideline Production Hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall opens for exhibition.
    Leaders such as Zhu De, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin visited the preview.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: The Rural Sideline Production Hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall officially opened today. This is another important component of the agricultural exhibition hall after the exhibition of national Dazhai-style agricultural models. It vividly reflects the excellent situation of rural sideline production in our country.
    Party and state leaders such as Zhu De, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin have all visited the preview of the sideline production hall. They pointed out that holding such an exhibition is beneficial to educating the people and promoting production.
    In the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall, the sideline production hall has always been a rich and colorful part, most able to attract audiences. This is because it fully reflects the characteristics of our country, which is located in the tropical, temperate, and frigid zones, has a vast territory, and is rich in products. This new exhibition maintains this characteristic. More importantly, the main part of this exhibition is the achievements and experiences of thirty-five typical units that have developed rural sideline production. The exhibition mainly features a wide variety of dazzling sideline production products from all over the country, including those planted in the ground, raised in the water, collected in the mountains, and hand-woven, so it can be said that there is everything. The second is various photos, charts, and models.
    This exhibition powerfully illustrates that the collective farmers in our country are, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, taking grain as the key link, engaging in diversified operations, and advancing towards the depth and breadth of production. The various materials on display also show that rural sideline production occupies a very important position in the entire national economy. Developing sideline production can comprehensively utilize rural manpower, material resources, and resources, increase wealth for society, accumulate funds for agriculture, provide raw materials for industry, and increase income for commune members. It is a major issue related to accelerating socialist construction and meeting the needs of urban and rural people. Since the people's communes, rural sideline production in our country has continued to develop on a new basis. The rural sideline products operated in various places have expanded to eleven major categories and thousands of varieties; the output value of sideline production accounts for about one-third of the total output value of agriculture and sideline production. The entire rural sideline industry has become a powerful force for promoting agricultural production and accelerating socialist construction.
    The practical experience of the typical units exhibited this time proves that the vigorous development of rural sideline production is the result of the vast numbers of cadres and masses in various places, under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to taking class struggle and the struggle between the two roads as the key link, constantly highlighting politics, conscientiously implementing the policy of "taking agriculture as the main task, using sideline production to support agriculture, and comprehensive management," and fully leveraging the superiority of the people's communes. Our country has a vast territory and extremely rich natural resources, and any region can develop sideline production in accordance with local conditions. The thirty-five typical units exhibited this time include various types of regions such as mountainous areas, plains, hills, lakes, and coastal areas. The experience of these units proves that as long as we earnestly strengthen leadership, adhere to putting Mao Zedong Thought in command, and fully mobilize and rely on the masses, rural sideline production can be started, gradually expanded, and well managed in any region.

    我国农村副业生产形势大好
    全国农业展览馆农村副业馆开馆展出
    朱德、李先念和谭震林等领导人参观了预展
    新华社十五日讯　全国农业展览馆的农村副业馆，今天正式开馆展出。这是继展出全国大寨式农业典型之后，农业展览馆展出的又一个重要组成部分。它生动地反映了我国农村副业生产大好形势。
    朱德、李先念和谭震林等党和国家领导人都参观过副业馆的预展。他们指出，举办这样的展览，对教育人民和促进生产都是有益的。
    在全国农业展览馆中，副业馆从来是一个丰富多采、最能吸引观众的部分。因为它充分反映了我国地处热、温、寒三带，幅员辽阔，物产丰富的特点。这次新的展出保持了这个特点。更重要的是，这次展出的主体部分，是三十五个发展农村副业典型单位的成绩和经验。展出的主要是种类繁多、琳琅满目的来自全国各地的副业生产的产品，包括地里栽种的、水中养植的、山上采集的和手工编制的，可说是应有尽有。其次就是各种照片、图表和模型等。
    这次展出有力地说明：我国集体农民正按照毛主席的教导，以粮为纲，多种经营，向生产的深度和广度进军。展出的各种资料也表明，农村副业在整个国民经济中占着十分重要的地位。发展副业生产，可以综合利用农村的人力、物力和资源，为社会增加财富，为农业积累资金，为工业提供原料，为社员增加收入，是一个关系到加速社会主义建设和满足城乡人民需要的重大问题。人民公社化以来，我国农村副业在新的基础上继续发展，各地经营的农村副业产品，已扩大到十一大类、几千个品种；副业产值占到了农副业总产值的三分之一左右。整个农村副业，已成为促进农业生产，加速社会主义建设的一支强大的力量。
    这次展出的各典型单位的实践经验证明：农村副业生产的蓬勃发展，是各地广大干部和群众在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，坚持以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，不断地突出政治，认真地贯彻执行“以农为主、以副养农、综合经营”方针，和充分发挥人民公社优越性的结果。我国幅员广大，自然资源极为丰富，任何地区都可因地制宜地发展副业生产。这次展出的三十五个典型单位，就包括有山区、平原、丘陵、滨湖和沿海等各种类型的地区。这些单位的经验证明，只要认真加强领导，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，又能充分发动和依靠群众，无论在什么样的地区，农村副业都可以办起来，逐步地办大和办好。
