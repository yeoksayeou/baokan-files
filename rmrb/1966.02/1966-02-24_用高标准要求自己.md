　　Demand High Standards of Yourself
　　Yang Guodong, a member of a certain unit of the former Ouyang Hai's division
    Reading "The Song of Ouyang Hai," my heart is truly churning like boiling water, filled with excitement, unease, and shame. Especially Ouyang Hai's attitude towards criticism from revolutionaries, and his magnanimous heart in enduring grievances, deeply touched me.
    In our daily work and relationships with comrades, we may encounter misunderstandings. How can work always be smooth, everything satisfactory, without suffering any grievances? But regarding grievances, some people can bear them and think them through, while others cannot endure them and let them go. Once, I went to a superior department to report on work. The round trip was several miles, and coincidentally, a report form was wrong, and it took a long time to check. When I returned to the company, the company commander said unhappily, "Does reporting take half a day? You, that's your problem, you chat for a while after finishing work, instead of seizing the time to do more!" I was very unconvinced. With this knot in my heart, I was in low spirits for several days.
    After reading "The Song of Ouyang Hai" this time, and thinking about that incident, I felt that something was wrong. What was Ouyang Hai's attitude towards criticism! He clearly did a good deed for the masses: braving the flames, rescuing the old woman, and getting injured himself. However, because the deputy instructor didn't understand the situation, he was not praised, but was criticized. He suffered much greater misunderstandings than I did, but in this situation, what did Ouyang Hai think, what did he say, what did he do?
    He thought like this: In the revolutionary ranks, the relationship between comrades is the relationship of class brothers. For some "bumps" that inevitably occur between each other, we should deal with them with a revolutionary principled attitude rather than a personalistic attitude. When a revolutionary soldier dedicates himself to the communist ideal, he should be able to do so without changing face or skipping a beat. What does suffering such a small grievance in front of him matter!
    He said this: "As a soldier, under any circumstances, we should actively understand the criticisms or praises from our superiors, so that we can keep in step and do our work well."
    He did this: He did not complain about the deputy instructor because of this, but humbly accepted the opinions from a positive perspective; he did not emphasize objective reasons to defend himself, but instead used the spirit of "correcting mistakes if you have them, and guarding against them if you don't" to demand more strictly of himself, taking the lead in self-criticism in the class; he did not become discouraged because of this, but instead moved forward towards higher goals with revolutionary spirit!
    The most fundamental reason why Ouyang Hai could think, say, and do this in the face of comrades' misunderstandings is that he could "read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions." Every word and deed should be based on the interests of the class and the revolution, without any regard for personal honor, face, or gains and losses. If a person has such a broad vision and open mind, what can't he think through, what can't he touch, what difficulties can overwhelm him!
    Doing revolution requires being able to withstand beatings. A person who cannot be touched on the tiger's behind can never become a strong revolutionary fighter in his life. In the future, I must earnestly read Chairman Mao's books, steadfastly do what Chairman Mao said, demand high standards of myself, and be a fighter like Ouyang Hai who can withstand any beating.

### 用高标准要求自己

　　用高标准要求自己
　　欧阳海生前部队某部　杨国栋
    读着《欧阳海之歌》，心里真象沸腾了的水一样在翻腾着，又是激动，又是不安，又是惭愧。特别是欧阳海对待批评的革命者的态度，忍受委屈的豁达的心胸，更给了我深深的触动。
    在日常工作里，在同志关系上，我们都可能碰到一点误解。干工作哪能事事舒坦，样样称心，不受一点儿委屈呢？可是对于委屈，有些人受得了、想得开，有些人却挺不住、放不下。有一次，我到上级部门去汇报工作。这趟路来回有好几里地，恰巧又有一个报表弄错了，查对了好久。回到连队后，连长不高兴地说：“汇报用得了大半天？你呀，就是这个毛病，工作干完了还要扯一阵，不抓紧时间多干点事！”我听了很不服气。心里有了这个疙瘩，好几天情绪都不高。
    这回看了《欧阳海之歌》，想想那桩事，感到不对味儿了。人家欧阳海对待批评是怎样的态度呵！他明明为群众做了件好事：冒着烈火，救出了老大娘，自己受了伤。可是，由于副指导员不了解情况，没有受到表扬，反而挨了顿批评。他受的误解比我大多了，可是在这种情况下，欧阳海是怎么想的，怎么说的，怎么做的呢？
    他是这样想的：在革命队伍里，同志之间的关系是阶级弟兄的关系，对于相互之间难免发生的一些“磕磕碰碰”，应该用革命的原则态度而不应该用个人主义的态度来处理。一个革命战士为着共产主义理想而献身的时候，应该做到脸不变色心不跳，眼前受这么一点委屈，又算得了什么呢！
    他是这么说的：“我们作为一个战士，无论在任何情况下，都应该从积极方面去领会上级的批评或表扬，这样才能步调一致，才能把工作搞好。”
    他是这样做的：他没有因此而抱怨副指导员，而是从积极的方面虚心接受意见；他没有强调客观原因为自己申辩，而是以“有则改之，无则加勉”的精神更严格地要求自己，带头在班上检查；他没有因此而情绪不振，而是以革命的精神朝着更高的目标前进！
    在同志的误解面前，欧阳海所以能这样想，这样说，这样做，最根本的原因在于他能“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。”一言一行都能从阶级的、革命的利益着眼，丝毫不计较个人的荣誉、面子、得失。一个人有了这样远大的眼光，宽阔的心胸，还有什么事儿想不开，什么事儿碰不得，什么困难压得倒呢！
    干革命是要经得起摔打的。一个老虎屁股摸不得的人，一生一世也不能成为一个坚强的革命战士。今后我一定要认认真真地读毛主席的书，踏踏实实地按毛主席说的去做，用高标准要求自己，做一个象欧阳海那样的经得起任何摔打的战士。
