    Wear Out Double Straw Sandals on a Thousand-Li Journey
    Li Ying
  Amidst the chaotic mountains, willow greens are like mist,
  The Spring Festival brings joy to everyone’s heart.
  Where does the Political Commissar spend the holiday?
  ——At the frontline outpost on the mountain peak!
  He asks the soldiers,
  How to begin this new year;
  After asking, he brings a bundle of yellow rice straw,
  Teaching how to weave straw sandals while chatting:
  In those days, how much hardship was there,
  Too much to count;
  Look at the hands, blister after blister,
  Look at the feet, callus upon callus.
  The revolutionary road is long and far,
  Dangerous mountains and treacherous waters spread across the clouds,
  A myriad of paths in everyone’s heart,
  From Jinggangshan to Yan'an.
  Wear out double straw sandals on a thousand-li journey,
  Even if the clouds are deep, the fog is heavy, and the frost and snow are cold!
  Weaving until the rooster crows at midnight,
  The kang brick seat is warm, the lamp oil is burned dry.
  Especially those poor peasant elders,
  After sending straw sandals, they stuff in needles and thread,
  Soldiers think of the villagers a thousand li away,
  Reluctant to wear a pair of straw sandals.
  It is precisely the villagers’ deep affection,
  Sweat irrigates the rice straw, making it golden;
  Unafraid of frost, resistant to water,
  Every strand is further than the main road.
  ?The pear blossoms are fresh, the peonies are beautiful,
  But they can’t compare to the imprint of straw sandals shining in one’s eyes;
  West to East, North to South,
  Big roads and small roads walked all over.
  Devote a lifetime to making revolution with the Party,
  Occupied the village, conquered the county,
  Barefoot soldiers carrying spears,
  Finally overturned the golden palace!
  Now more than thirty years have passed,
  The roads that have been walked must be looked after diligently;
  The mountains and waters where straw sandals have been worn out,
  Are right there amidst the vast clouds and waters.
  The brazier fire is weak, the lamp flame is dim,
  The soldiers all think of the past;
  After the Political Commissar tells of the old days,
  His mouth has three parts bitterness and seven parts sweetness.
  Let’s add a red velvet ball to the straw sandals,
  With thread ropes as ears on both sides;
  After weaving the straw sandals, let’s try them on,
  Hey! What a pair of "priceless treasures"!
  Tread on the ground, light and soft,
  Take a step, feeling sweet in the heart;
  Saving gasoline and electricity,
  A pair of "golden feathered arrows" for traversing mountains and rivers.
  The Political Commissar raises his head and leaves the outpost,
  Ten pairs of straw sandals follow behind;
  Looking at the ground, looking at the sky,
  The stars seem lower, and the road seems wider!
  New Year, how to start?
  Tie the straw sandals tightly and walk through the mountain passes!
  Even if the revolutionary future is full of difficulties and dangers,
  With the Party leading the way, we dare to ascend to the heavens!

    打双草鞋走千里
    李瑛
  乱山柳色绿如烟，
  新春佳节人人欢，
  政委哪里把节过？
  ——高山顶上前哨班！
  问战士，
  怎样起步这新一年；
  问罢抱来捆黄稻草，
  边教打草鞋边谈天：
  那时节，艰辛岁月有多少，
  难数也难算；
  看手上，泡连泡，
  看脚下，茧重茧。
  革命的道呵长又远，
  险山恶水铺云端，
  人人心上万条路，
  从井冈到延安。
  打双草鞋走千里，
  哪怕云深雾重霜雪寒！
  直打到半夜小鸡子叫，
  炕坯坐热，灯油熬干。
  最是那贫农老乡亲，
  送罢草鞋塞针线，
  战士千里念乡亲，
  背一双草鞋舍不得穿。
  正是乡亲情意重，
  汗浇稻草金灿灿；
  霜打不败，水沤不烂，
  根根更比大道远。
  ?药花鲜哟牡丹花艳，
  比不过草鞋印子照人眼；
  西到东，北到南，
  大路小路走个遍。
  一辈子跟党闹革命，
  占下了村，攻下了县，
  泥巴脚杆子扛梭镖，
  终于踏翻了金銮殿！
  而今已过三十载，
  走过的大路要勤相看；
  草鞋踏烂的山和水，
  就在那茫茫云水间。
  塘火弱，灯花暗，
  战士个个想从前；
  政委讲罢旧年月，
  嘴里有三分苦味七分甜。
  草鞋上再缀一朵红绒球，
  线绳做耳排两边；
  打完草鞋试一试，
  嘿！好一双“金不换”！
  踩踩地，轻又软，
  迈迈步，心里甜；
  又省汽油又省电，
  一双翻山越岭的“金翎箭”。
  政委昂头出哨所，
  十双草鞋跟后边；
  望望地，望望天，
  星显得低哟路也显得宽！
  新年月，怎样起步？
  系紧草鞋走关山！
  哪怕革命前程多艰险，
  有党引路敢登天！
