    The recently concluded Indian National Congress annual meeting was a chaotic farce. It reflects the deepening crisis facing the ruling Indian party due to its pursuit of reactionary domestic and foreign policies.
    Currently, the Indian National Congress government is beset by internal and external troubles, and its situation is very unfavorable. In particular, the domestic famine situation is very serious, and the Indian people's struggle against hunger is expanding. The corruption and incompetence of the National Congress ruling authorities are becoming increasingly clear to the broad masses of the people. The leaders of the National Congress obviously hoped to strengthen their position through this annual meeting. The result was the opposite; fierce arguments broke out at the conference, and the National Congress government's food policy was subjected to unprecedentedly fierce criticism. This is precisely a reflection of the National Congress government's loss of popular support.
    The leaders of the National Congress attempted to divert attention by inciting anti-China sentiment, praising the new Soviet leaders and the "Tashkent Declaration," and clamoring to continue occupying Kashmir. This, of course, is impossible. They forgot what the National Congress elder Gandhi said: "A hungry man thinks first of filling his belly, everything else is secondary." Whether it is Chavan's hackneyed slander of China's "aggression," Kamaraj's eulogy praising "Kosygin's diplomatic skills," or Indira Gandhi's vow to "not give up" Kashmir, none of them can fill the people's stomachs or alleviate the growing dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the Indian people. How can one blame the fact that complaints are also rising within the National Congress?
    It seems that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Indian National Congress government to continue muddling along with its old tricks.

    视线岂能转移
    刚刚结束的印度国大党年会，是一出乱七八糟的闹剧。它反映了印度执政党由于奉行反动的国内外政策招致日益加深的危机。
    目前，印度国大党政府内外交困，处境是十分不妙的。特别是国内粮荒的情况十分严重，印度人民反饥饿的斗争正在扩大。国大党统治当局的腐败无能越来越清楚地暴露在广大人民的面前。国大党的领导人显然希望通过这次年会加强他们的地位。结果却是适得其反，大会上爆发了激烈的争吵，国大党政府的粮食政策遭到了空前猛烈的抨击。这正是国大党政府失尽民心的一种反映。
    国大党领导人企图用煽动反华、吹捧苏联新领导和“塔什干宣言”以及叫嚷继续霸占克什米尔等手法，来转移视线，这当然是办不到的。他们忘记了国大党的元老甘地说过的一句话：“挨饿的人首先想到的是吃饱肚子，别的东西都在其次。”不管是恰范诬蔑中国“侵略”的滥调也好，卡马拉季吹捧“柯西金的外交手腕”的颂词也好，甘地夫人鼓吹“不放弃”克什米尔的誓言也好，都不可能给老百姓充饥，不可能缓和广大印度人民日益增长的不满情绪。这又怎怪得在国大党内部也怨声四起呢？
    看来，印度国大党政府靠了它的老把式继续混下去，是越来越不容易了。
