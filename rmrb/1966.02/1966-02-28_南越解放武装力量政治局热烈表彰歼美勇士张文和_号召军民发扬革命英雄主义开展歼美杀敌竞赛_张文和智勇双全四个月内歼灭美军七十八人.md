　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 25th (Dispatch) -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Political Bureau of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces issued a communique on the 18th, warmly commending Zhang Wenhe, the platoon leader of the guerrilla force in Dien Ban District, Quang Nam Province, and an "American-Annihilating Hero."
　　Hero Zhang Wenhe used self-made weapons to annihilate 78 American invaders and destroy two enemy M-113 amphibious armored vehicles in four months. He was recently awarded the First Class Liberation War Service Medal by the Command of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces.
　　In the past year, Zhang Wenhe has been awarded the glorious title of "American-Annihilating Warrior" four times. This time, the Political Bureau of the Liberation Armed Forces has commended him as an "American-Annihilating General."
　　The communique called on soldiers of main forces, guerrillas, local forces, and all patriots to promote revolutionary heroism, further promote the competition movement of "finding Americans to annihilate and finding puppet troops to fight," and strive to reach and surpass Zhang Wenhe's record as an "American-Annihilating General."
　　The communique concluded by saying that everyone should launch a competition to annihilate Americans and eliminate puppets. No matter how many more hundreds of thousands of troops the U.S. imperialism sends, and no matter what scale it strengthens and expands its war of aggression to, the South Vietnamese military and civilians will surely defeat them and achieve complete victory.
　　The South Vietnamese *Liberation Army Daily* also recently published an editorial calling on the entire army to launch a movement to learn from "American-Annihilating General" Zhang Wenhe.
　　The editorial stated that Zhang Wenhe is an "American-Annihilating General" who has created outstanding records. His exploits, along with those of thousands of "American-Annihilating Warriors" on various battlefields, are a concrete manifestation of the unparalleled heroic fighting spirit of our southern military and civilians. It proves that, based on a high degree of hatred for the enemy and a lofty patriotic spirit, our military and civilians have brought into play our spiritual advantages and are creating hundreds of ways to fight that win more with less, overcome the strong with the weak, and defeat modern weapons with simple weapons. It also proves that the potential of our military and civilians to strike and defeat the American invaders is infinite.
　　The editorial called on the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces to vigorously launch a competition to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the enemy-annihilating record of "American-Annihilating General" Zhang Wenhe, vigorously promote the victories already achieved, further promote the spirit of revolutionary heroism, further enhance the spirit of decisive victory, and give the American invaders and their running dogs even heavier blows.
　　Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Zhang Wenhe is a wise and courageous young guerrilla fighter from Dien Ban District, Quang Nam Province. In the four months of the second half of last year alone, he eliminated 154 enemies, including 78 American invaders.
　　Last year, when American bandits poured into South Vietnam in large numbers, killing and setting fires everywhere, Zhang Wenhe was determined to heroically annihilate the American invading bandits and defend his motherland and hometown, just as his father and brothers had resisted the French colonialists in the past. Once, he went with the guerrillas of Hoa Vang District to ambush the enemy near an American military base. In this battle, he killed three American bandits. From then on, he came to the conclusion: "Americans are not scary."
　　After this, Zhang Wenhe more actively thought of various ways to annihilate the enemy. In early September last year, American bandits came to the countryside to harass, and as soon as they entered the village, they were fiercely attacked by Zhang Wenhe and his companions, killing 16 of them on the spot. Zhang Wenhe alone killed six, and the surviving enemies retreated in a panic.
　　On September 11th last year, after carefully studying the terrain, Zhang Wenhe cleverly laid a minefield in a certain place. An enemy M-113 amphibious armored vehicle and the 23 American soldiers and weapons on board were blown to pieces. The American invading troops behind attempted to come and carry the corpses of their companions, but another six were killed.
　　The wise and courageous Zhang Wenhe used this method to kill more than 40 American invading soldiers and destroy two M-113 armored vehicles. In addition, he also used stake pits and traps he had personally set up, combined with sniping, to eliminate a large number of American troops.
　　In order to annihilate the U.S. military, Zhang Wenhe also worked with the masses to use unexploded bombs and shells dropped by the enemy to manufacture hundreds of landmines and thousands of arrows to strike the enemy.
　　Because Zhang Wenhe bravely annihilated a large number of American bandits and made many meritorious contributions, at the recent first "American-Annihilating Warrior" conference in the Central Trung Zone of South Vietnam, this 24-year-old guerrilla fighter was honorably awarded the First Class Liberation War Service Medal and the title of "American-Annihilating Warrior."

　　南越解放武装力量政治局热烈表彰歼美勇士张文和
　　号召军民发扬革命英雄主义开展歼美杀敌竞赛
　　张文和智勇双全四个月内歼灭美军七十八人
    新华社河内二十五日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量政治局十八日发表公报，热烈表彰广南省奠盘县游击队中队长、“歼美勇士”张文和。
    张文和勇士以自造武器，四个月里歼灭七十八名美国侵略者和击毁敌人两辆M—113型两栖装甲车，于最近荣获了越南南方解放武装力量指挥部授予一级解放战功勋章。
    在过去一年中，张文和曾四次获得“歼美勇士”的光荣称号，这次解放武装力量政治局嘉奖他为“歼美健将”。
    公报号召各主力部队、游击队、地方部队的战士们和一切爱国人士，发扬革命英雄主义，进一步促进“找美国佬歼、找伪军打”的竞赛运动，为争取达到和超过张文和“歼美健将”的纪录而奋斗。
    公报最后说，人人展开歼美灭伪的竞赛，今后不管美帝国主义再增派几十万军队，不管它加强、扩大侵略战争到什么规模，南越军民也必将击败他们，取得完全胜利。
    越南南方《解放军报》最近也发表社论，号召全军开展学习“歼美健将”张文和的运动。
    社论说，张文和是一个曾经创造了出色纪录的“歼美健将”。他和各个战场上的数千名“歼美勇士”的战功，是我们南方军民的无比英勇的战斗精神的具体表现。证明了我们军民本着对敌人的高度仇恨和崇高的爱国主义精神，发扬精神上的优势，已经和正在创造出以少胜多、以弱胜强、以简陋武器胜现代化武器的千百种打法。还证明了我们军民打击和战胜美国侵略者的潜力是无穷无尽的。
    社论号召越南南方解放武装力量大力掀起学、赶、超“歼美健将”张文和的歼敌纪录的竞赛，大力发扬已取得的胜利，进一步发扬革命英雄主义精神，进一步提高决战决胜精神，给予美国侵略者及其走狗以更加沉重的打击。
    新华社讯　张文和是广南省奠盘县一位智勇双全的青年游击战士。仅在去年下半年的四个月内，他就消灭了一百五十四名敌人，其中有七十八名美国侵略者。
    去年，当美国强盗大量开进越南南方，到处杀人放火的时候，张文和下定决心，要象自己的父兄当年抗击法国殖民者那样，英勇歼灭美国侵略强盗，保卫自己的祖国和家乡。有一次，他同和旺县游击队员一起到一个美军基地附近去伏击敌人。在这次战斗中，他打死了三个美国强盗。从此，他得出一个结论：“美国佬不可怕。”
    此后，张文和更加积极地想出各种办法来歼灭敌人。去年九月初，美国强盗到乡下来骚扰，刚进村，就遭到张文和和他的同伴的猛烈打击，当场打死其中十六名，仅张文和一个人就打死六名，幸存的敌人慌忙撤退。
    去年九月十一日，张文和在仔细地研究了地形以后，便在某地巧妙地摆下一个地雷阵。敌人的一辆M—113型两栖装甲车和车上的二十三名美国兵和武器被炸得稀烂。走在后头的美国侵略军企图前来搬运同伙的尸体，结果又被炸死六名。
    智勇双全的张文和，就是用这种方法先后打死了四十多名美国侵略兵，炸毁两辆M—113型装甲车。此外，他还用自己亲手设下的桩板坑和陷阱，结合着打冷枪，消灭了大批美军。
    为了歼灭美军，张文和还同群众一起，利用敌人扔下的没有爆炸的炸弹和炮弹，制造了几百颗地雷和成千支箭来打击敌人。
    由于张文和勇敢地歼灭了大批美国强盗，立下许多战功，所以在最近举行的越南南方中部中区第一次“歼美勇士”大会上，这位二十四岁的游击战士，光荣地获得了一级解放战功勋章和“歼美勇士”的称号。
