    Learn from "Yu Gong" and Don't Fear Difficulties
    Li Zhiduan, Foreman of No. 2 Blast Furnace, Anshan Iron and Steel Works

    Last November, the leadership transferred several of us female comrades to work on the blast furnace as shift foremen. At that time, I was very excited, feeling that this was the Party's trust in us, and also feeling proud and honored that women could refine iron on the blast furnace. However, while excited, I also thought about the difficulties in the actual work. Because it was unprecedented for female comrades to work on the blast furnace, and also as foremen, would the master workers support us? Could we lead a team? Furthermore, due to lack of physical strength, some work might be impossible to do, what should be done? I went to Chairman Mao's writings to find the strength to overcome difficulties. When I read "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" again, I felt that the difficulties I encountered were so insignificant compared to the mountains in front of Yu Gong's house, especially compared to the mountains that weighed on the Chinese people before liberation! Today, we have the leadership of the Party, the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and the enthusiastic support of veteran workers. What difficulties can't be overcome? Thus, I strengthened my confidence in overcoming difficulties. In order to dig away the mountains in front of me, I insisted on being diligent in mind, diligent in observation, and diligent in action in my actual work, humbly learning from experienced masters, and gradually familiarizing myself with the production situation. When my physical strength was insufficient and I couldn't swing the hammer, I strengthened my physical exercise. In this way, I finally overcame one difficulty after another. I am also determined to study Chairman Mao's works well, overcome other difficulties, and strive for continuous progress.

    不怕困难学“愚公”
    鞍钢炼铁厂二高炉工长　李志端
    去年十一月，领导把我们几位女同志调到高炉上担任值班工长工作，当时我的心情非常激动，觉得这是党对我们的信任，同时也为妇女能在高炉上炼铁而感到骄傲和自豪。然而，在激动的同时也想到了实际工作中的困难，因为女同志上高炉，而且又担任工长，这是从来没有的事情，师傅们能支持我们吗？要领导一个班组，能领导得了吗？再者，由于体力不足，有些工作可能做不来，怎么办呢？我到毛主席著作中去找克服困难的力量。当我又一次读完《愚公移山》时，我感到自己所碰到的困难与愚公门前的大山比较，特别与解放前压在中国人民头上的大山比较，是多么微不足道！我们今天有党的领导，有毛主席的思想作指导，又有老工人的热情支持，有什么困难克服不了？于是增强了克服困难的信心。为了挖掉眼前的几座大山，我便在实际工作中坚持做到脑勤、眼勤、手勤，虚心向老师傅学习，逐步熟悉生产情况；体力不足，抡不动榔头，就加强身体锻炼。这样终于克服了一个个困难。我还要下定决心，好好学习毛主席著作，克服其他困难，争取不断进步。
