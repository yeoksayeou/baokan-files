    Receive Praise, Seek Shortcomings
    Team Leader Zhang Shilin
    Praise is a good thing in itself. Why should we seek shortcomings after receiving praise?
    Our team is one of the Daqing Oilfield's model teams, and we have received several award banners; one of them, the "Never Blunting Tip" award banner, was received by me on behalf of the entire team from the hands of leading comrades at a conference.
    That night, after returning to the dormitory, excited hearts were boiling. Some comrades recalled the situation since joining the campaign, saying that we have indeed done a good job in the many years of the campaign. Now, walking on the grassland, we can see the wells we drilled everywhere. Some comrades said: "We drill many wells and receive much praise. This is a fact. But great achievements do not mean we have no shortcomings...." Thus, a debate unfolded.
    A few days later, our team conducted a large-scale discussion to find shortcomings. Everyone looked, and everything was examined. One of the points was that, although we have been praised by the higher authorities and are one of the model teams, have we done all our work perfectly? Through discussion and comparison with advanced units, all employees received a profound education in their thinking. After affirming our achievements, we felt that although we had made some progress since the campaign, we were still far from the requirements of the higher authorities, and compared with advanced units, there were still many gaps in certain areas of our work.
    At that time, the third shift was a relatively advanced shift. Through finding shortcomings, they also saw the problems existing in the shift. They found that the first shift had good quality, the second shift was aggressive, and the fourth shift had good safety.
    Through a large-scale search for shortcomings, we realized that advanced units also have shortcomings, and backward units also have unique strengths. The backward should see the favorable factors, and the advanced units should see the existing problems. The more advanced the unit, the more humble it should be, and the more it should find its shortcomings. If we do not look at things in this way, the advanced will only see the advanced, and will fall into a complacent circle, heading towards becoming backward from being advanced; conversely, the backward will not see the light, which will make them feel discouraged and unable to transform from backward to advanced.
    We realized that Mao Zedong Thought is great, and we must have a one-divides-into-two viewpoint when looking at problems.
    Our final conclusion is:
    Receive praise once, seek shortcomings once.

### 受表扬　找差距

    受表扬　找差距
    队长　张石林
    表扬本来是好事。为什么受一次表扬，又要找一次差距呢？
    我们队是大庆油田标杆队之一，得过几面奖旗；其中一面：“永不卷刃的尖刀”奖旗，就是我代表全队，在一次大会上从领导同志手中接过来的。
    那天晚上回宿舍后，一颗颗激动的心沸腾着。有的同志回忆起参加会战以来的情形，说咱们会战多年，确实干得不错。现在走在草原上，到处都能看到我们钻过的井。有的同志说：“我们打井多，受表扬多。这是事实。但成绩大，不等于我们没缺点……。”于是一场争论展开了。
    过了几天，我们队进行了一次大找差距的讨论。人人找，事事找。其中有一条，就是虽然受到上级的表扬，是标杆队之一，是不是工作都做到家了？通过讨论，对比先进单位，全体职工思想上受到一次很深刻的教育。我们把成绩肯定下来之后，感到会战以来虽然做出一些成绩，但离上级要求还差很远，比先进单位，在某些工作上差距依然不少。
    当时三班是个比较先进的班。通过找差距，也看出班里存在的问题。他们找出一班质量好，二班上得猛，四班安全好。
    通过大找差距，使我们认识到：先进单位也有不足之处，后进单位也有独长的地方。后进者要看到有利因素，先进单位要看到存在的问题。越是先进单位，越要虚心，越要找出不足之处。如果不是这样看待事物，先进的光看到先进，便会陷入一个自以为是的圈圈里，走向一个由先进变成后进的地步；反之，后进者看不到光明，就会使自己灰心丧气，不能变后进为先进。
    我们认识到：毛泽东思想是伟大的，看问题要有一分为二的观点。
    我们最后的结论是：
    受一次表扬，找一次差距。
