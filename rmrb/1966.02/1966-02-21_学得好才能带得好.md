　　Learning Well is a Prerequisite to Leading Well
　　◇Abstract of Beijing Daily Editorial◇
　　The Beijing Municipal Experience Exchange Meeting on Studying Chairman Mao’s Works illustrates that creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, giving prominence to politics, is the key link in all work. This has been recognized and applied by an increasing number of people. When a unit or a comrade does this, their ideological outlook changes, and their work becomes vigorous and dynamic; if they do not do this, bourgeois ideology will run rampant, and their work will suffer setbacks. Countless facts show that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force; once Marxist-Leninist theory is grasped by the masses, it will transform into a tremendous material force.
　　To carry out the movement of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively, deeply, solidly, and persistently, the key lies in leadership. Party organizations at all levels must not only grasp the work of studying Chairman Mao’s works by the broad masses but also grasp the work of studying Chairman Mao’s works by leading cadres. It is necessary to further implement "leaders take the lead, grasping the leaders," and emphasize "leaders learn, leaders lead," so that leading cadres can become thorough revolutionaries and thorough dialectical materialists in the face of the increasingly deepening development of the socialist revolution.
　　Leading cadres must first solve the problem of why it is necessary to give prominence to politics and why politics should command professional work. Only in this way can the problem of leaders learning be truly solved. As leading cadres, they also have the question of whom to serve, which class to serve, which path to take, and what ideology and methods to use to work. Whether you are aware of it or not, you encounter these questions every day. If you do not give prominence to proletarian politics on these issues, you will inevitably give prominence to bourgeois politics; if you do not give prominence to Mao Zedong Thought, you will inevitably give prominence to capitalist and revisionist thought. Using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything and giving prominence to politics is determined by the laws of socialist development. Failure to do so is a violation of the laws of socialist development, a forgetting of class struggle, a forgetting of whom you serve, and a manifestation of weak Party spirit.
　　Whether or not to use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything is itself a serious class struggle. There can be no eclecticism in giving prominence to politics. Eclecticism is opportunism. Party committees at all levels must further conduct propaganda and education for leading cadres, earnestly expose contradictions, launch discussions, and strive for unified understanding through struggle, so that everyone can move from unconsciously giving prominence to politics to consciously giving prominence to politics, and truly consolidate the concept of using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything.
　　Giving prominence to politics means grasping class struggle. To grasp it well, it is necessary to start by analyzing the particularity of contradictions, and it is necessary to combine it with reality. Without grasping living ideas and without grasping specific contradictions, theory will inevitably be divorced from reality, and giving prominence to politics will be empty talk.
　　To grasp living ideas, it is necessary to grasp the most fundamental ones. That is to say, it is necessary to grasp the main contradictions. At present, the struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology, between the socialist road and the capitalist road, is the fundamental contradiction. Grasping this fundamental contradiction and resolving it fiercely can solve major problems and truly achieve using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything.
　　Leading cadres and veteran cadres are valuable assets of the Party and the people. They have made significant contributions in past revolutionary struggles. In the future, they must still stand at the forefront of socialist revolution and socialist construction, so that our great cause can be victoriously advanced. Now, in the face of the new revolutionary situation, every leading cadre must improve their consciousness of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, compare themselves with Zhang Side, with Bethune, and with Jiao Yulu, find the gap in their ideological revolutionization, and set high standards for continuous transformation and continuous revolution. Every leading cadre should have a longer Party membership, a stronger Party spirit, and become redder in thought as they get older. Every leading cadre should not be afraid of hardship or death, learn as long as they live, and revolutionize for a lifetime, transform for a lifetime, devote themselves to the revolution, and struggle to the end for the cause of communism.

　　学得好才能带得好
　　◇北京日报社论摘要◇
    北京市学习毛主席著作经验交流会说明，活学活用毛泽东思想，突出政治，是一切工作的纲，已经被越来越多的人所认识，所运用。那个单位，那个同志这样做了，思想面貌就发生变化，工作就做得生气勃勃；不这样做，资产阶级思想就泛滥，工作就吃败仗。无数事实说明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，就是最大的战斗力；马克思列宁主义的理论一旦被群众所掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量。
    要把活学活用毛泽东思想的运动更广泛、更深入、更扎实、更持久地开展下去，关键在于领导。各级党组织既要把广大群众学习毛主席著作的工作抓紧抓好，又要把领导干部学习毛主席著作的工作抓紧抓好。要进一步贯彻好“头头抓，抓头头”，要强调“头头学，头头带”，使领导干部在社会主义革命日益深入发展的形势面前，当彻底的革命派，当彻底的辩证唯物主义者。
    领导干部首先要解决为什么要突出政治，为什么要政治统帅业务的问题。这样，才能真正解决头头学的问题。作为领导干部，同样有个为谁服务、为那个阶级服务的问题，有个走什么道路的问题，有个用什么思想、用什么方法去工作的问题。这些问题，不管你自觉不自觉，都是天天要碰到的。在这些问题上，不突出无产阶级政治，就必然会突出资产阶级政治；不突出毛泽东思想，就必然会突出资本主义、修正主义思想。用毛泽东思想统帅一切，突出政治，是社会主义发展规律所决定的。不这样做，就是违背社会主义发展规律，就是忘了阶级斗争，忘了自己是为谁服务的，就是党性不强的表现。
    要不要毛泽东思想统帅一切，这本身就是一场严肃的阶级斗争。在突出政治上，不能有折衷主义。折衷主义就是机会主义。各级党委要进一步向领导干部进行宣传教育，认真揭露矛盾，展开讨论，经过斗争，求得统一认识，使大家由不自觉突出政治到自觉突出政治，把毛泽东思想统帅一切的观念真正巩固起来。
    突出政治，就是抓阶级斗争。要抓得好，就必须从分析矛盾的特殊性着手，就必须与实际相结合。不抓活思想，不抓特殊矛盾，必然理论脱离实际，突出政治就会是一句空话。
    抓活思想，要抓最根本性的。这就是说，要抓主要矛盾。当前，无产阶级思想与资产阶级思想，社会主义道路与资本主义道路的斗争是根本性的矛盾。抓到了这种根本性的矛盾，狠狠地解决，就能解决大问题，就真正能做到用毛泽东思想统帅一切。
    领导干部，老干部，是党和人民的宝贵财产。他们在历次革命斗争中，做出了重大的贡献，今后，他们仍然要站在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的前列，使我们的伟大事业，胜利推向前进。现在，在新的革命形势面前，每一个领导干部，都要提高活学活用毛泽东思想的自觉性，对照张思德，对照白求恩，对照焦裕禄，找出自己思想革命化的差距，对自己提出不断改造、不断革命的高标准。每一个领导干部，都应该党龄越长，党性越强，年纪越老，思想越红。每一个领导干部，都应该不怕苦不怕死，干到老学到老，革命一辈子，改造一辈子，为革命鞠躬尽瘁，为共产主义事业奋斗到底。
