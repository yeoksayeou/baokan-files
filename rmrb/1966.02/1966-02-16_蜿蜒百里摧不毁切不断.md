　　蜿蜒百里摧不毁切不断
    日本《读卖新闻》一月二十日刊登该报驻西贡特派记者中泽写的一篇题为《越共的地道》的报道，描写美国侵略者及其帮凶军对南越人民地道战无比恐惧的情况。摘要如下：
    规模之大美军吃惊
    在西贡以北的铁三角地带，最近美军“扫荡”扑空后，发现越共的地道网。虽然还未能窥其全豹，它的规模足使美军极为吃惊。估计它的长度约在五十至六十公里。据参加搜索的兵士说，它比纽约的地下铁道还要巧妙。由于它处在坚厚的粘土地面和花岗岩下面，即使“B—52”（美军战略轰炸机）投下任何重磅炸弹也不受影响。美军想要彻底破坏它非常困难。下面是澳大利亚军某中队士兵威廉·霍尔（二十一岁）写的他曾经参加地道搜索的经过。
    左拐右转没有尽头
    一月九日我进入的越共地道是从一间普通的越共小屋下去的。我左手拿着照明灯，右手握着手枪，我感到好象进入地狱般的可怕。
    我一进去就碰坏了头，进入地道只有三英尺多处，就向左拐，跟着又向右拐。我只能靠着照明灯小心翼翼地前进。虽然这一带越共早已离开，但仍要留心他们的偷袭。我刚向右转行进了十英尺似乎到了尽头，可是到了那里时，左面、右面又发现了一条接一条的地道。好容易前进了几英尺又到了尽头，这时两面又有新的地道。说是说在地道中“行进”，实际上我们是依靠两肘和两膝“爬进”。地道高度只及半个人，而且我们不能出一点声音，神经紧张得要死。
    又要向左边拐弯了，我和最初一样，用照明灯慢慢推向前面，再把头伸前，看看前面有没有敌人，确定没有敌人后，再慢慢爬。大约爬了几十英尺，回到地面透一口气，再从另一个地道口进去。
    坑道巧妙洞中有洞
    挖掘这些地道的越共无疑是第一流的坑道手。挖得又巧妙又精巧，洞中有洞。这些“地下仓库”都被很巧妙地伪装着，它的盖子是水泥做的，但是和地道地面的表土完全
  一样，一点也分不出来。爬得稍微快一点就忽略了过去。但是有些盖子并非都是“地下仓库”的大门，如果糊里糊涂遇到盖子去揭开可就糟了。有时越共特地在这些地方装了炸药，它一下就会把人炸得粉身碎骨。
    横洞直洞四通八达
    我们在地道中摸爬，彼此都不敢出声，同伴中彼此都没有联络，因为地洞很窄，步话机带不进来，无线电带不进来，一切都“不通”。因此，一进到了地洞里面，就只能自己依靠自己了。
    在地道里面无论你怎么叫喊，地面上的同伴也听不到。而且地道四通八达，越共说不定从什么地方钻进来打你，真是越爬越害怕。即使被批评为懦夫，我也毫不掩饰钻在这种地洞中的恐惧感。因为这里和地面战斗完全两样，身子动一动都不行。四周黑漆漆的，我想在任何场所作战都没有在地洞中恐怖。你想想这种情形吧！在地道里需要四肢爬行，逐寸前进，地面高低不平，前后一片黑暗。当你发现了地道中的盖子，你需要揭开它，也许你就在揭开这一瞬间被炸死。即使什么事也没有发生，你已满身吓得大汗淋漓，然而洞中还有洞，有横洞、直洞，真是防不胜防。洞里面还有许多奇形怪状的虫，蜈蚣、蝎子……。比毒虫更使人害怕的是洞壁上一个个越共的手印，这些手印也许就是几秒钟以前越共留下的，一想到他们可能在地道中窥伺你时，你不战栗才怪呢！

Winding for a Hundred Miles, Unbreakable and Uncuttable

The Japanese *Yomiuri Shimbun* published an article on January 20 written by its Saigon-based special correspondent, Nakazawa, entitled "The Viet Cong's Tunnels," describing the immense fear of the American aggressors and their accomplice troops towards the South Vietnamese people's tunnel warfare. An excerpt follows:

The Scale Stuns the U.S. Military

In the Iron Triangle area north of Saigon, after a recent U.S. military "sweep" came up empty, they discovered the Viet Cong's tunnel network. Although they have yet to see its full extent, its scale is enough to astonish the U.S. military. It is estimated to be about fifty to sixty kilometers long. According to soldiers who participated in the search, it is more ingenious than the New York subway system. Because it is located under thick clay soil and granite, even if a "B-52" (U.S. strategic bomber) drops any heavy bombs, it will not be affected. It is very difficult for the U.S. military to completely destroy it. The following is an account written by William Hall (21 years old), a soldier of a certain squadron of the Australian army, about his experience participating in the tunnel search.

Turning Left and Right, There is No End

On January 9, the Viet Cong tunnel I entered descended from an ordinary Viet Cong hut. I held a flashlight in my left hand and a pistol in my right hand, and I felt as if I had entered a hellish nightmare.

As soon as I entered, I hit my head. After entering the tunnel for just over three feet, it turned to the left, followed by a turn to the right. I could only proceed cautiously with the help of the flashlight. Although the Viet Cong had already left this area, we still had to be careful of their sneak attacks. I had just turned right and traveled ten feet when it seemed to reach the end, but when I got there, I found tunnel after tunnel on the left and right. After finally advancing a few feet, I reached the end, at which point there were new tunnels on both sides. Although it is said that we were "advancing" in the tunnel, in reality we were "crawling" on our elbows and knees. The height of the tunnel was only half a person, and we couldn't make a sound, we were so nervous we were about to die.

We had to turn to the left again. As before, I slowly pushed the flashlight forward, then stretched my head out to see if there were any enemies ahead. After confirming that there were no enemies, I slowly crawled forward. After crawling for dozens of feet, I returned to the surface to take a breath, and then entered from another tunnel entrance.

Ingenious Tunnels, Caves Within Caves

The Viet Cong who dug these tunnels are undoubtedly first-class tunnelers. They dug them cleverly and meticulously, with caves within caves. These "underground warehouses" were cleverly disguised. Their lids were made of cement, but they were exactly the same as the topsoil of the tunnel floor, and one couldn't tell them apart at all. If you crawled a little faster, you would overlook them. However, some lids are not the doors to "underground warehouses." It would be terrible to rashly open one. Sometimes the Viet Cong deliberately placed explosives in these places, which would blow people to pieces in an instant.

Horizontal Tunnels and Vertical Tunnels, Interconnected in All Directions

We crawled in the tunnels, afraid to make a sound. There was no contact between comrades, because the tunnels were too narrow, and walkie-talkies and radios could not be brought in. Everything was "disconnected." Therefore, once you entered the tunnel, you could only rely on yourself.

No matter how much you shout in the tunnel, your comrades on the surface cannot hear you. Moreover, the tunnels are interconnected in all directions. The Viet Cong might drill in from somewhere and attack you. The more you crawl, the more afraid you become. Even if I am criticized as a coward, I will not hide my fear of crawling in such tunnels. Because it is completely different from ground combat. You can't move your body even a little. It is pitch black all around. I think there is no place to fight that is more terrifying than in a tunnel. Think about this situation! In the tunnel, you need to crawl on all fours, inching forward, with uneven ground and darkness ahead and behind. When you find a lid in the tunnel, you need to open it. Maybe you will be blown to death at that moment. Even if nothing happens, you are covered in cold sweat from fear. However, there are caves within caves, horizontal tunnels, and vertical tunnels. It is really impossible to guard against. There are many strange-shaped insects, centipedes, scorpions... in the caves. What is even more frightening than poisonous insects is the Viet Cong's fingerprints on the cave walls. These fingerprints may have been left by the Viet Cong just a few seconds ago. You can't help but shudder when you think that they might be spying on you in the tunnel!
