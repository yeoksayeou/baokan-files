    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 19th dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Rusk emphasized to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 18th that the United States must "regard the South Vietnam battlefield as part of a larger world struggle" and must not abandon South Vietnam.
    He opposed some members of the Senate who demanded restricting the U.S. government's power to increase troops in South Vietnam. He said that the U.S. President "should be able to use the military flexibly in any way required by the security of our country."
    Rusk testified before the Foreign Relations Committee regarding the government's Vietnam policy. In a lengthy speech, he tried his best to defend the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression against Vietnam.
    Referring to the four-point position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Rusk said that "North Vietnam's four-point peace package is unacceptable. Although three of the four points are negotiable, the other point would be equivalent to the Communist Party taking over South Vietnam." This nakedly exposed the aggressor's ambition to seize South Vietnam by force and exposed that its so-called "peace talks" were merely synonymous with attempting to make the Vietnamese people submit and surrender.
    The U.S. Secretary of State made blatant war threats, saying that the scale of the South Vietnam war "depends on the extent to which the other side attempts to take over South Vietnam by force." He opposed some senators' proposals to limit the scale of the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam.
    He again played the peace card, shamelessly saying that the United States, in order to "seek peace, has given the Communists almost everything except South Vietnam."
    This mouthpiece of U.S. imperialism indicated that he fantasizes that the Chinese people will succumb to U.S. military pressure like modern revisionists and that a so-called "internal transformation process" will occur. He said, "If the United States persists in Asia, China and its allies will eventually enter the same stage as the Soviet Union, and it is possible to shift from belligerent goals to peaceful competition." He emphasized that the U.S. government should "utilize" the emergence of modern revisionism in implementing its foreign policy. He said, "A very prominent representative of the Communist world" once told him that the number one problem today is to turn China to peaceful coexistence with the West.
    After Rusk's speech, he was bombarded with questions from senators.
    Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright expressed concern that the United States was becoming too deeply involved and isolated on the South Vietnam battlefield. He said, "We are more deeply involved than ever before." "Few countries are helping the U.S. cause with troops." He also pointed out that the U.S. "peace offensive" is propaganda, and the U.S. government insists on "unconditional surrender." The Vietnamese people do not believe that the United States will truly withdraw.
    Fulbright's speech greatly angered Rusk, who asked Fulbright what he advocated. Fulbright replied, "Committed to achieving a compromise." Rusk retorted, "We can't even get them to the table." Fulbright said, "Then there must be something wrong with our method," "There must be something wrong with our diplomacy."
    Under the questioning and siege of some senators, Rusk was "irritable" and complained that now is a difficult time to be Secretary of State, and this is a "complex and dangerous" moment "for everyone in this room."

### 腊斯克叫嚷坚持扩大侵越战争  重申以武力霸占南越暴露和谈目的是为了诱降  在美国参议员围攻下大叫国务卿难当

    腊斯克叫嚷坚持扩大侵越战争
    重申以武力霸占南越暴露和谈目的是为了诱降
    在美国参议员围攻下大叫国务卿难当
    据新华社十九日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿腊斯克十八日在参议院外交委员会强调，美国必须把南越战场“看作是一场范围更大的世界斗争的一部分”，而决不能放弃南越。
    他反对参议院中有人要求限制美国政府增兵南越的权力。他说，美国总统“应当可以以我们国家的安全所要求的任何方式灵活使用军队”。
    腊斯克是在外交委员会就政府侵越政策作证的。他在长篇发言中竭力为美帝国主义侵越政策辩护。
    在谈到越南民主共和国的四项主张时，腊斯克说，“北越的四点和平一揽子主张是不能接受的。虽然四点中的三点是可以谈判的，另外一点将等于由共产党接管南越”。这就赤裸裸地暴露侵略者以武力霸占南越的野心，暴露了它嘴里的所谓“和平谈判”只不过是妄图要越南人民屈服投降的同义语。
    美国国务卿进行露骨的战争恫吓说，南越战争的规模“取决于对方在多大程度上试图以武力接管南越”。他反对某些参议员提出的对美国侵越战争的规模加以限制的意见。
    他又在玩弄和平一手，无耻地说，美国为了“谋求和平，除了南越以外几乎什么都给共产党人了”。
    这个美帝国主义的代言人表明，他妄想中国人民会象现代修正主义者那样，在美国军事压力下会屈服，出现所谓“内部变化过程”。他说，“要是美国在亚洲坚持下去，中国和它的盟国最终将进入同苏联一样的阶段，有可能从好战的目标转入和平竞赛”。他强调美国政府在执行它的对外政策中要“利用”现代修正主义的出现这一事实。他说，“共产党世界的一个非常著名的代表”曾经对他说，今天的头号问题是使中国转而同西方和平共处。
    腊斯克发言后受到参议员连珠炮般的质问。
    外交委员会主席富布赖特表示担心美国在南越战场上陷入太深和处境孤立。他说，“我们比过去任何时候要卷入得深得多”。“很少国家是在用军队帮助美国的事业”。他还指出，美国的“和平攻势”是宣传，美国政府坚持的是“无条件投降”。越南人民不相信美国真正会撤退。
    富布赖特的发言使腊斯克大为光火，他问富布赖特，他主张怎么办。富布赖特回答说，
  “致力于实现妥协”。腊斯克反击说，“我们连使他们到桌子旁来还做不到。”富布赖特说，“那末一定是我们的办法有些毛病”，“一定是我们的外交有些毛病”。
    在一些参议员的质询和围攻下，腊斯克“心情暴躁”，抱怨说，现在是难当国务卿的时刻，这“对这个屋子里的每个人来说也是复杂和危险”的时刻。
