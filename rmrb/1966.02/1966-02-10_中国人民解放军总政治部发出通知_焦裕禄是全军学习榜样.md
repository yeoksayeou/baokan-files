    The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Issues Notice
    Jiao Yulu is a Model for the Whole Army to Learn From
    Emphasis should be placed on learning his wholehearted service to the people, learning his grasp of ideological revolutionization, learning his deep class feelings for the masses, and learning his style of relying on the masses and going deep into reality.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 9th. The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a notice today, calling on all officers in the army, especially those above the regimental level, to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, the former Secretary of the Lankao County Party Committee in Henan Province.
    The notice said that Comrade Jiao Yulu was a good member of our Party, a good son of the Chinese people, and a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong. He was a great communist fighter who grew up under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought, a model for county party secretaries to learn from, and also a model for our entire army to learn from. We must focus on learning the following four aspects from him:
    First, serve the people wholeheartedly. Not for fame, not for gain, wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people, with the entire people in his heart, and only himself not there. For the cause of the revolution, he worked with tenacious fighting spirit and regardless of personal safety, “I will not rest in peace until the goal is achieved.”
    Second, grasp the ideological revolutionization of people, and first grasp the ideological revolutionization of leading cadres. Always maintain the true qualities of ordinary laborers, set a good example, and resolutely oppose special privileges. Be good at being a "squad leader," treat people sincerely, unite comrades, and ensure that the leading group has unified thinking and unified actions.
    Third, have deep class feelings for the masses, share the joys and sorrows with the masses, “appear in front of the masses when they are most in difficulty, and care for and help the masses when they are most in need.”
    Fourth, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, come from the masses, and go to the masses. Go deep into reality and conduct investigations and research. Have both revolutionary courage and soaring enthusiasm, as well as a pragmatic attitude and a down-to-earth style. In all work, start by understanding the situation and try to grasp first-hand materials, not eating "food that others have chewed."
    The notice said that Comrade Jiao Yulu’s glorious deeds have set a example for us of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and solving practical problems in our own regions and departments. When we learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, in the final analysis, we are learning from him how to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to take command in everything, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform ourselves and guide our work, and regard learning Mao Zedong Thought as a lifelong combat task.
    The notice requires party committees and political organs at all levels to regard organizing cadres to earnestly study Comrade Jiao Yulu’s deeds as an important part of continuing to implement the five principles of giving prominence to politics. The notice pointed out that Comrade Lin Biao had long instructed: We must humbly learn from the localities and learn all the good ideas, good experiences, good styles, and good methods from the localities. We should resolutely implement Comrade Lin Biao's instruction, learn from Jiao Yulu, learn from Wang Jinxi and Chen Yonggui, learn from Daqing and Dazhai, learn all the good people and good deeds and advanced units in the localities, and, together with all comrades in the Party and the people of the whole country, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, give prominence to politics, implement the "four goods," and strengthen war preparedness.

    中国人民解放军总政治部发出通知
    焦裕禄是全军学习榜样
    要着重学习他全心全意为人民服务，学习他抓人的思想革命化，学习他对群众的深厚阶级感情，学习他依靠群众、深入实际的作风
    新华社九日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部今天发出通知，号召全军干部特别是团以上干部，都要向河南省兰考县前县委书记焦裕禄同志学习。
    通知说，焦裕禄同志是我党的好党员，中国人民的好儿子，毛泽东同志的好学生。他是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的伟大的共产主义战士，是县委书记学习的榜样，也是我们全军学习的榜样。要着重学习他以下四个方面：
    一、全心全意为人民服务。不为名，不为利，一心为革命，一心为人民，心里装着全体人民，唯独没有他自己。为了革命事业，以顽强的斗志，奋不顾身地进行工作，“不达目的，死不瞑目”。
    二、抓人的思想革命化，首先是抓领导干部的思想革命化。永远保持普通劳动者的本色，做好样子，坚决反对特殊化。善于当“班长”，诚恳待人，团结同志，使领导班子思想齐、动作齐。
    三、对群众怀有深厚的阶级感情，与群众同呼吸、共命运，“在群众最困难的时候，出现在群众的面前，在群众最需要帮助的时候，去关心群众，帮助群众”。
    四、依靠群众，发动群众，从群众中来，到群众中去。深入实际，调查研究。既有革命的胆略，冲天的干劲，又有实事求是的态度，扎扎实实的作风。做一切工作，首先从了解情况出发，尽量掌握第一手材料，不吃“别人嚼过的馍”。
    通知说，焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹，为我们树立了一个活学活用毛泽东思想，解决本地区、本部门实际问题的典范。我们学习焦裕禄同志，归根到底，就是学习他活学活用毛主席著作，处处用毛泽东思想挂帅，用毛泽东思想改造自己、指导工作，把学习毛泽东思想作为毕生的战斗任务。
    通知要求各级党委和政治机关，都要把组织干部认真学习焦裕禄同志的事迹，当作继续贯彻执行突出政治五项原则的重要内容。通知指出，林彪同志早就指示过：要虚心向地方学习，把地方上的一切好思想、好经验、好作风、好方法都学到手。我们应当坚决执行林彪同志的这个指示，学习焦裕禄，学习王进喜、陈永贵，学习大庆，学习大寨，学习地方上的一切好人好事和先进单位，和全党同志、全国人民一道，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，突出政治，落实四好，加强战备。
