    Vietnam Foreign Ministry Strongly Protests U.S. Resumption of Bombing War Actions
    Vietnamese People Fear No Sacrifice and Are Determined to Thoroughly Defeat U.S. Imperialism
    Whether the U.S. "Suspends Bombing" or Resumes Bombing, It Cannot Change Its Fate of Failure
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 1st (Dispatch) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on February 1st regarding the U.S. dispatching of aircraft to bomb and strafe the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in a war action. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    On January 31, 1966, the U.S. government again used its air force to bomb and strafe many areas in the Vinh Linh region and the provinces of Quang Binh, Nghe An, Thanh Hoa, and Son La in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    For a year, the destructive war waged by the U.S. air force against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has suffered heavy defeats. U.S. imperialism has not only failed to shake the determination of the Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save the country, but has also been strongly opposed by the people of the world. Recently, under strong pressure from public opinion, the U.S. government "suspended bombing" of North Vietnam for a period of time to feign an attitude of "sincerity."
    However, in fact, during this period, the United States has been trying its best to strengthen and expand its war of aggression against Vietnam. The Johnson administration has requested the U.S. Congress to increase expenditures for the Vietnam War to more than 23 billion U.S. dollars, as this year's financial budget and other special expenditures. In South Vietnam, the United States has sent an additional 13,000 American troops and is preparing to double the current 200,000 American troops. The United States and its puppet troops have conducted many large-scale "sweeps," especially the large-scale "sweeps" in the central coastal area in recent days. They used extremely savage and modern warfare tools to implement a "scorched earth" policy of "kill all, burn all, and destroy all" in densely populated areas of South Vietnam. In North Vietnam, U.S. aircraft intruded into North Vietnamese airspace nearly 400 times to conduct reconnaissance and prepare for new attacks. Moreover, U.S. aircraft have twice bombed western areas of Thanh Hoa Province. At the same time, the United States has used B-52 aircraft to frantically bomb the Laotian liberated areas, instigated its South Vietnamese and Thai lackeys to send troops to invade Cambodian territory, and threatened to expand the war to the entire Indochina.
    U.S. imperialism is very stubborn and cunning. It plots to use the means of "suspending bombing" the North to force the Vietnamese people to accept U.S. conditions. However, whether bombing or "suspending bombing," U.S. imperialism, which has already been defeated, will still be defeated. The U.S. imperialist action of resuming air strikes against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 31 exposed its extremely reactionary colonialist, aggressive, and bellicose face, and exposed the false peace face of the Johnson administration. This is an extremely arrogant challenge by U.S. imperialism to the free-loving and justice-upholding public opinion that is severely condemning it.
    The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly protest the above-mentioned barbaric actions of the U.S. government. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam earnestly calls on the fraternal socialist countries, the people and governments of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, and the people of the world, including the American people, to further vigorously support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people, and to demand that the U.S. government stop its war of aggression against Vietnam, permanently and unconditionally stop bombing and strafing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and withdraw all U.S. and its puppet troops and weapons from South Vietnam, and to carry out a more resolute and powerful struggle.
    The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have repeatedly clarified their just position and sincere attitude. On January 24, 1966, President Ho Chi Minh, in letters to the heads of many countries, expressed the Vietnamese people's iron will to defend the sovereignty of their motherland, national independence, and world peace, and affirmed the peaceful position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    As long as U.S. imperialism continues to wage its war of aggression against Vietnam, continues to use U.S. and its puppet troops to invade South Vietnam, and continues to use its air force to bomb and strafe the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the people of both regions of Vietnam will fear no sacrifice, resolutely resist to the end, and resolutely and thoroughly defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressors.

### 越南外交部强烈抗议美国恢复轰炸的战争行动  越南人民不怕牺牲坚决彻底打败美帝  美国“暂停轰炸”也罢、，恢复轰炸也罢，都改变不了失败命运

    越南外交部强烈抗议美国恢复轰炸的战争行动
    越南人民不怕牺牲坚决彻底打败美帝
    美国“暂停轰炸”也罢，恢复轰炸也罢，都改变不了失败命运
    新华社河内一日电　越南民主共和国外交部一日就美国又派遣飞机轰炸、扫射越南民主共和国的战争行动发表声明。声明全文如下：
    一九六六年一月三十一日，美国政府又用空军轰炸、扫射越南民主共和国的永灵区和广平、义安、清化、山萝等省的许多地方。
    一年以来，美国用空军对越南民主共和国进行的破坏性战争已经遭到了惨重的失败。美帝国主义不仅没有动摇越南人民抗美救国的决心，而且还受到世界人民的强烈反对。最近，在舆论的强大压力下，美国政府“暂停轰炸”越南北方一段时间，以装出有“诚意”的姿态。
    但是，事实上，在这期间内，美国仍然竭力强化和扩大对越南的侵略战争。约翰逊政府已经要求美国国会把用于越南战争的开支增加到二百三十亿美元以上，作为今年的财政预算和其他特别支出。在越南南方，美国增派了一万三千名美国军队，并且准备把目前的二十万名美国军队增加一倍。美国及其仆从军队进行了多次大规模的“扫荡”，尤其是在最近几天对中部中区沿海地区的大规模“扫荡”。他们使用了极端野蛮的现代化战争工具，对越南南方居民稠密地区实行“杀光、烧光和毁光”的“焦土”政策。在越南北方，美国飞机侵犯越南北方领空近四百次，进行侦察，为新的袭击作准备。而且，美国飞机还曾两次轰炸清化省西部地区。同时，美国还用B—52型飞机，疯狂轰炸老挝解放区，唆使其南越和泰国走狗派遣军队侵犯柬埔寨领土，威胁要把战争扩大到整个印度支那。
    美帝国主义非常顽固和狡猾。它阴谋以“暂停轰炸”北方的手段，来迫使越南人民接受美国的条件。但是，不论轰炸或者“暂停轰炸”，已经遭到失败的美帝国主义仍将要遭到失败。一月三十一日，美帝国主义恢复对越南民主共和国的空袭的行动，揭穿了它极端反动的殖民主义的侵略好战面目，揭穿了约翰逊政府假和平的面目。这是美帝国主义对正在严厉谴责它的爱好自由和主持公理的舆论的极其蛮横的挑战。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府强烈抗议美国政府的上述野蛮行动。越南民主共和国政府恳切呼吁兄弟的社会主义各国、亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民和政府，以及全世界的人民，包括美国人民在内，进一步大力支援越南人民的正义斗争，为要求美国政府停止侵略越南的战争，永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸扫射，把美国及其仆从的军队和武器全部撤出越南南方而进行更加坚决和强有力的斗争。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府曾多次阐明自己的正义立场和诚挚态度。一九六六年一月二十四日，胡志明主席在写给许多国家首脑的信件中，表明了越南人民保卫祖国的主权、民族独立和保卫世界和平的钢铁般的意志，肯定了越南民主共和国的和平立场。
    只要美帝国主义还继续进行侵略越南的战争，还使用美国及其仆从军队侵略越南南方，还使用空军轰炸、扫射越南民主共和国，越南两地区人民就决不怕牺牲，坚决抗战到底，坚决彻底打败美帝国主义侵略者。
                  一九六六年二月一日于河内
