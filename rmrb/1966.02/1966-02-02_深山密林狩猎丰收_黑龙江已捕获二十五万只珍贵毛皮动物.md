    Hunting Bumper Harvest in Deep Mountains and Dense Forests
    Heilongjiang Has Captured 250,000 Valuable Fur-Bearing Animals
    (Xinhua News Agency, Harbin) In the frigid Heilongjiang province, over 10,000 hunters are currently hunting in the deep mountains and dense forests and on the rivers every day. From November last year to the eve of this year’s Spring Festival, the province has captured a total of 250,000 valuable fur-bearing animals such as sable, mink, muskrat, and yellow weasel. Commercial departments in various regions are stepping up procurement and processing to supply the domestic and international markets.
    Heilongjiang Province has a cold winter climate. To adapt to these climatic conditions, various wild animals change their fur once they enter winter. At this time, the animal's fur is long, has a lot of fluff, has a high unit density, is glossy, and has the best quality. Therefore, the fur produced here in winter has always been welcomed at home and abroad.
    Due to the destructive hunting before liberation, Heilongjiang Province's rich wild animal resources suffered serious damage. After liberation, it was rapidly restored and developed. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the hunters organized hunting teams and joined the people's communes. Relevant government departments provided them with grain, oil, anti-cold clothing, hunting guns, ammunition and other production tools and daily necessities. Many hunting teams are engaged in agriculture, raising wild animals, and planting ginseng during the closed hunting season. The income of the hunters has been continuously increasing, and their lives have been greatly improved. The hunting team of the Shenshu Town People's Commune in Tieli County had only 17 members and 300 yuan of capital when it was first established. Now the team has 73 members and an annual income of more than 70,000 yuan.

    深山密林狩猎丰收
    黑龙江已捕获二十五万只珍贵毛皮动物
    据新华社哈尔滨电　气候严寒的黑龙江省，目前每天有一万多名猎民在深山密林里和江河上狩猎。从去年十一月到今年春节前夕，全省共捕获二十五万只紫貂、水貂、麝鼠、黄鼬等珍贵的毛皮动物。各地商业部门正抓紧收购，进行加工，供应国内外市场。
    黑龙江省冬季气候寒冷，各种野生动物为了适应这种气候条件，入冬后，都要换一次毛，这时动物的毛长、绒多、单位密度大，有光泽、质量最好。所以这里冬季出产的毛皮，一向受国内外的欢迎。
    由于解放前进行毁灭性的猎捕，黑龙江省丰富的野生动物资源遭到了严重的破坏。解放后，得到了迅速的恢复和发展。猎民在人民政府领导下，组织了狩猎队，加入了人民公社，政府有关部门供给他们粮食、油料、防寒衣物、猎枪、弹药等生产工具和生活日用品。许多狩猎队在禁猎期从事农业和养殖野生动物、种参等活动，猎民收入不断增加，生活有很大的改善。铁力县神树镇人民公社狩猎队，刚成立时只有十七个社员和三百元资金，现在这个队有七十三个社员，每年收入达七万余元以上。
