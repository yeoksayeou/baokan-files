    According to Xinhua News Agency, Zanzibar, February 12th: Tens of thousands of Zanzibar people held a military parade, demonstration and mass rally here on the 12th to warmly celebrate the second anniversary of the Zanzibar Revolution.
    Tanzanian President Nyerere and First Vice President Karume reviewed the military and mass parade, and then spoke at the mass rally.
    Those attending the celebration included Tanzanian ministers, Zanzibar ministers, members of the Revolutionary Council, and leaders of the Afro-Shirazi Party.
    Also present were state guests from twenty-seven countries and regions, including government delegations and representatives from China, Albania, Vietnam, and North Korea, as well as representatives of African nationalist organizations. Fully armed troops of the Zanzibar Tanzanian People's Defence Force marched past the reviewing stand in formation. Behind them were ranks of youth volunteers holding rifles.
    Workers and peasants, singing and dancing, participated in the parade, waving picks, shovels, hoes, machetes and other tools, demonstrating their desire to build the country through self-reliance.
    After the parade, a mass rally was held. President Nyerere paid tribute to the Zanzibar Revolution when he spoke at the mass rally, and called on the Tanzanian people to build the country "relying on ourselves." He said, "It is not good to rely on others." "Relying on aid makes us (African) countries semi-independent."
    First Vice President Karume, in his speech, recalled the various oppressions suffered by the Zanzibar people during colonial rule, and talked about the achievements made by the Zanzibar people since the revolution.
    In the evening, Karume held a state banquet at the National Palace here to celebrate the Revolution Day.
