    According to Xinhua News Agency, London, February 9th: British Prime Minister Wilson, during a debate on the Southeast Asian situation in the House of Commons on the 8th, repeatedly defended the United States' resumption of bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, saying that in the face of the Communists' repeated rejection of all "peace efforts," "the United States had no other choice but to resume bombing." He openly declared that Britain "has an obligation" to support the actions of the United States.

    Wilson described the recent activities of the United States in peddling the "peace talks" fraud as a "great peace offensive" and expressed his willingness to continue serving the United States by giving "full support" to any new "peace talks" tricks.

    Following the robber logic of the United States, Wilson slandered China and Vietnam as "enemies of negotiation" and "enemies of peace." He was not satisfied with the Labour government acting as an accomplice in the US aggression against Vietnam, and openly incited British parliamentarians to demonstrate in front of the Chinese Representative Office, saying, "I would like to see extra-parliamentary activities outside the Chinese Embassy in support of peace in Vietnam."

    威尔逊又露出一副美国帮凶嘴脸
    叫嚷“有义务”支持美国侵越　煽动议员到中国代办处示威
    据新华社伦敦九日电　英国首相威尔逊八日在下院辩论东南亚局势时一再为美国恢复轰炸越南民主共和国辩解，说什么面对共产党接二连三地拒绝所有的“和平努力”，“美国没有其他选择，只有恢复轰炸”。他公然声称，英国“有义务”支持美国的行动。
    威尔逊把美国最近到处推销“和谈”骗局的活动说成是“伟大的和平攻势”，并且表示要继续为美国效劳，对任何新的“和谈”花招“给予完全的支持”。
    威尔逊按照美国的强盗逻辑诬蔑中国和越南是“谈判的敌人”、“和平的敌人”。他对工党政府亦步亦趋地充当美国侵略越南的帮凶还感到不满足，公然煽动英国议员到中国代办处门前示威，他说，“我倒是希望在中国大使馆外能看到争取越南和平的会外活动。”
