    The Johnson administration's resumption of bombing of North Vietnam and its intensified preparations to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam are pushing the American people's anti-war movement to a new climax. In recent days, mass protests and demonstrations have been held one after another in various parts of the United States, strongly demanding an end to the war of aggression against Vietnam. The U.S. "National Coordinating Committee to End the War in Vietnam" has also called on the people of all countries to launch global demonstrations on the 5th. The American people's opposition to the war of aggression against Vietnam is becoming more and more激昂 (jī'áng - impassioned), and a new and greater storm is coming.
    An unjust war of aggression can never gain the support of the people, because it is not only detrimental to the people of other countries, but also to the people of one's own country. In fact, with the "gradual escalation" of U.S. imperialism in the war of aggression against Vietnam, the broad masses of the American people are suffering increasingly deep disasters, and therefore they cannot help but launch increasingly fierce resistance. This trend that the American people are bound to rise up in revolution is something that the American ruling clique cannot change no matter what deceptive and repressive means they use.
    The American people are a great people. In this century, they have twice risen up against foreign imperialism. Now, for the first time, they are rising up against domestic imperialism, which is unprecedented in history. This is an important sign of the unprecedented awakening of the American people. U.S. imperialism is indeed surrounded by the people of the world, including the American people. The American people will surely bury U.S. imperialism together with the people of all countries.

    美国人民站起来
    约翰逊政府恢复对越南北方的轰炸，加紧准备扩大侵越战争的行动，正在把美国人民的反战运动推向新的高潮。美国各地群众近几天接连举行抗议示威，强烈要求结束侵越战争。美国“结束越南战争全国协调委员会”并且号召各国人民在五日展开全球性大示威。美国人民反对侵越战争的情绪越来越激昂，新的更大风暴正在来临。
    非正义的侵略战争，是绝对得不到人民支持的，因为它不仅不利于他国人民，而且也不利于本国人民。事实上，随着美帝国主义在侵越战争中的“逐步升级”，广大美国人民蒙受着日益深重的灾害，因而他们自然不能不展开日益猛烈的反抗。美国人民是一定要起来革命的这种趋势，是美国统治集团不管用什么样的欺骗和镇压手段都改变不了的。
    美国人民是伟大的人民。在本世纪中，他们曾经两度起来反对外国的帝国主义。现在，他们第一次起来反对本国的帝国主义，这是历史上没有过的。这是美国人民空前觉醒的重要标志。美帝国主义确实在全世界人民，包括美国人民在内的重重包围中。美国人民必将和世界各国人民一道埋葬美帝国主义。
