	Both Need to be Soothed
	According to American news agencies, Johnson's trip to Honolulu, besides discussing steps to expand the war, had one purpose: to "appease the rulers of South Vietnam."
	At the same time, these news agencies pointed out that Johnson went to Honolulu because criticism of his aggressive policy in Vietnam was intensifying in the U.S. Congress, and he had to leave Washington to escape the blame. In this case, Johnson himself also needs to be soothed. I wonder if the South Vietnamese puppet Nguyễn Cao Kỳ can give his American master some comfort?

    都需要安抚
    据美国通讯社说，约翰逊去檀香山，除了商量扩大战争的步骤之外，有一个目的是“安抚南越的统治者”。
    同时这些通讯社又指出，约翰逊去檀香山，是由于美国国会中对他的侵越政策批评日益激烈，他不得不离开华盛顿以逃避指责。这样说来，约翰逊自己也很需要安抚。不知南越的傀儡阮高其能给他的美国主子一点慰藉否？
