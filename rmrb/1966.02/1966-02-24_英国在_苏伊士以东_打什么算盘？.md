　　Britain's Designs "East of Suez"

    The British Labour government issued a defense white paper on the 22nd, stating that it would place the focus of Britain's military strategy in the "East of Suez" region, particularly in the Far East, in order to intensify collusion with the United States and suppress the revolutionary struggles of the Asian and African peoples.
    Britain's so-called "East of Suez" "defense" policy was first proposed by the Labour government in February 1965. The purpose of this policy is mainly to concentrate its efforts on strengthening control over Britain's traditional colonial interests and suppressing national democratic revolutionary movements in Asia and Africa, given the increasing decline of the British Empire and the easing of the situation in Europe; at the same time, it is to cooperate with the US war of aggression against Vietnam and the plan to shift the strategic focus eastward for the purpose of so-called "containing" China. British Prime Minister Wilson admitted at the end of last year that, due to fundamental changes in the world situation, the "nature, intensity, and geographical location of the problems" faced by Britain had "changed," and the "center of world danger" had "shifted to regions outside Europe," with Asia and the area around the Indian Ocean becoming the "greatest challenge to the West." He particularly clamored for "resisting China's threat to Asia and Africa."
    According to British newspaper interpretations, the scope of the so-called "East of Suez" region includes areas west from the east coast of Africa, across West Asia, South Asia, and the northern Indian Ocean, all the way to Southeast Asia and Australia. Most of Britain's 11 billion pounds of overseas investment is concentrated here. Most Commonwealth countries are also located in this region. Britain's annual exports to this region amount to 700 million pounds, and imports amount to over 600 million pounds. Many of Britain's important strategic materials, industrial raw materials, and food and beverages are sourced from this region. Strategically, this region has always been the lifeline of British imperialism and the hub and key to its control over Eurasian and African transportation. Britain has established military bases or facilities in Aden, the Federation of South Arabia, Bahrain Island, Diego Garcia Island, the Maldives, Ceylon, Singapore, Hong Kong, "Malaysia," Brunei, and Darwin, Perth, Sydney, and Woomera in Australia.
      The "East of Suez" region is the main capital upon which the British Empire relies to maintain its great power status, and the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles in this region are surging vigorously. Naturally, the British Labour government must step up its military deployments and place more and more of Britain's overseas military forces in this region. The total strength of the British army stationed in this region has increased from nearly 50,000 in early 1964 to about 100,000 in 1965, of which 50,000 are in Singapore and "Malaysia" alone. Britain has also transferred part of the Mediterranean Fleet to strengthen the Indian Ocean and Far East Fleets, bringing the number of its ships in this region to two-thirds of its entire navy.
    Britain's strengthening of its aggressive deployments "East of Suez" is precisely meeting the needs of the US imperialist policy of aggression. The Johnson administration, deeply mired in the quagmire of the war of aggression against Vietnam, is demanding that Britain share its heavy burden in this region. As early as December 1964, when Wilson visited Washington, Johnson asked Britain to work with the United States to "maintain peace and security in the Middle East and the Far East." Last November, when US Secretary of Defense McNamara visited London, he again exerted pressure, pointing out that Asia is the focus of US policy and demanding further cooperation from Britain. He even wanted Britain to directly participate in the war of aggression against Vietnam and serve the United States. Last December, Wilson visited the United States again and met with Johnson. The United States further demanded that Britain strengthen its so-called "defense" "East of Suez" to cooperate with the US strategic shift from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It is precisely on the common goals of suppressing the national liberation movement in this region and "containing" China that the United States and Britain are colluding with each other "East of Suez."
    However, Britain is facing numerous difficulties in implementing its aggressive policy "East of Suez" due to its economic difficulties, financial constraints, and limited strength. To save the precarious status of the pound sterling, Britain must cut overseas spending and reduce its balance of payments deficit. Now, military spending "East of Suez" accounts for 60 percent of Britain's overseas military spending, and it costs 250 million pounds in military expenses in Singapore and "Malaysia" alone. Wilson had to exclaim that British military spending must be "ruthlessly reduced, not only in weapons but also in the obligations we have undertaken." This acute contradiction of being unequal to the task is obvious.
    To solve this contradiction, Britain's main approach is to seek assistance from the United States, asking the United States to pay to share Britain's "defense" "East of Suez" in order to ease Britain's heavy burden. During his visit to the United States, Wilson proposed to Johnson that the two sides implement a strategic division of labor "East of Suez": Britain would be responsible for "defense" on the west coast of the Indian Ocean (i.e., Central and East Africa), and the United States would be responsible for "defense" in the Indochina Peninsula, the Indian subcontinent, and the Far East, with Britain, Australia, and New Zealand providing support from the side when necessary. In other words, the United States would shoulder the heavy burden, and Britain would act as a junior partner, to protect Britain's interests in this region. However, although the United States demanded that Britain undertake "defense" "East of Suez," it was unwilling to share military spending for Britain, but instead demanded that Britain increase its "contribution." According to Western news agencies, in this US-British meeting, the United States used the heavy burden of military spending in the war of aggression against Vietnam as an excuse to firmly oppose Britain's partial withdrawal from Cyprus, Aden, Singapore, and "Malaysia," and also vigorously resisted Britain's attempt to squeeze into the US-Australia-New Zealand aggression treaty group. It is precisely this contradiction of mutual exploitation and different calculations that has prevented the US and Britain from reaching a consistent agreement on the "defense" issue "East of Suez" in their previous meetings.
    All of this shows that Britain's aggressive policy "East of Suez" is doomed to failure. US imperialism has already suffered a disastrous defeat in Asia and is struggling to save itself. The British Labour government is linking its so-called "defense" "East of Suez" to the US line of aggression against Asia, attempting to rely on the strength of the United States to maintain its colonial interests "East of Suez." This will not only fail but will inevitably lose even its old capital, and in the end become a sacrificial object for US imperialism.

### 英国在“苏伊士以东”打什么算盘？

　　英国在“苏伊士以东”打什么算盘？
    英国工党政府二十二日发表国防白皮书，表示要把英国的军事战略重点放在“苏伊士以东”地区，特别是远东地区，以便同美国加紧勾结，镇压亚非人民的革命斗争。
    英国的所谓“苏伊士以东”的“防务”政策，最早是由工党政府在一九六五年二月提出的。这个政策的目的，主要是要在大英帝国日益没落和欧洲局势缓和的情况下，集中全力来加强控制英国的传统殖民利益，镇压亚非民族民主革命运动；同时配合美国侵越战争和目的在于所谓“遏制”中国的战略重点东移的计划。英国首相威尔逊去年年底就承认，由于世界局势发生根本变化，英国面临的“问题的性质、剧烈程度和地理位置已经改变”，“世界危险中心”已“转移到欧洲以外地区”，亚洲和印度洋周围已成为“对西方最大的挑战所在”。他特别叫嚷要“抵抗中国对亚非的威胁”。
    所谓“苏伊士以东”的地区范围，按照英国报纸的解释，包括西起非洲东海岸，横越西亚、南亚和印度洋北部地带，直到东南亚和澳洲地区。英国一百一十亿英镑的海外投资，大部分都集中在这里。英联邦国家也大部分处于这个地区。英国每年向这个地区的出口额达七亿英镑，进口额达六亿多英镑。英国的许多重要战略物资、工业原料和食物饮料，都是取自这个地区的。在战略上，这个地区一向是英帝国主义的生命线及其控制欧亚非交通的枢纽和要道。英国在这一带的亚丁、南阿拉伯联邦、巴林岛、迭戈加西亚岛、马尔代夫、锡兰、新加坡、香港、“马来西亚”、文莱和澳大利亚的达尔文、佩思、悉尼和武麦拉，都建立有军事基地或设施。
      “苏伊士以东”地区是大英帝国所赖以维持其大国地位的主要资本，而这个地区的反帝反殖民主义斗争又蓬勃高涨，英国工党政府当然就要加紧进行军事部署，把英国在海外的军事力量越来越多地放在这个地区。驻在这个地区的英国陆军总兵力已从一九六四年初的近五万人增加到一九六五年的十万人左右，其中仅在新加坡和“马来西亚”的就达五万人。英国还抽调部分地中海舰队来加强印度洋和远东舰队，使它在这个地区的舰只达到它全部海军舰只的三分之二。
    英国加强“苏伊士以东”的侵略部署，正迎合了美帝国主义侵略政策的需要。深深陷入侵越战争泥潭的约翰逊政府要求英国分担它在这个地区的沉重负担。早在一九六四年十二月威尔逊访问华盛顿时，约翰逊就要求英国同美国一道“维护中东及远东的和平安全”。去年十一月美国国防部长麦克纳马拉到伦敦时又施加压力，指出亚洲是美国政策重点，要求英国进一步予以配合。他甚至要英国直接参加侵越战争，为美国效劳。去年十二月，威尔逊再次访问美国同约翰逊会谈，美国进一步要求英国加强“苏伊士以东”的所谓
  “防务”，以配合美国战略重点从大西洋向太平洋的转移。正是在镇压这一地区的民族解放运动和“遏制”中国的共同目标上，美英两国在“苏伊士以东”相互勾结起来。
    但是，英国经济困难，财政窘迫，实力有限，在实行
  “苏伊士以东”的侵略政策方面面临重重困难。为了挽救摇摇欲坠的英镑地位，英国必须削减海外开支，减少国际收支逆差。现在“苏伊士以东”的军费占去英国海外军事开支的百分之六十，仅仅在新加坡、“马来西亚”两处就要花费二亿五千万英镑的军事费用。威尔逊只好惊呼英国军费必须“无情削减，不仅削减武器，而且削减我们承担下来的义务”。这种力不从心的尖锐矛盾是显而易见的。
    为了解决这种矛盾，英国的主要办法就是向美国求援，要美国出钱来分担英国在“苏伊士以东”的“防务”，以便缓和英国的沉重负担。威尔逊在访美时曾向约翰逊提出要求，双方在“苏伊士以东”地区实行战略分工：英国负责印度洋西岸（即中非和东非）的“防务”，美国负责印度支那半岛、印度次大陆和远东的“防务”，在必要时由英国、澳大利亚和新西兰从旁配合。也就是说，要美国挑起重担，英国充当小伙计，来保住英国在这个地区的利益。可是，美国虽然要求英国承担“苏伊士以东”的“防务”，却不愿为英国分担军费，反而要英国增加“贡献”。据西方通讯社透露，在这次美英会谈中，美国就以侵越军费负担沉重为理由，坚决反对英国从塞浦路斯、亚丁、新加坡和“马来西亚”作部分的撤退，而且对英国企图挤入美澳新侵略条约集团的要求竭力进行抵制。正是这种互相利用而又各有打算的矛盾，使美英双方的历次会谈都未能就“苏伊士以东”的“防务”问题达成一致的协议。
    这一切情况说明，英国所推行的这一套“苏伊士以东”的侵略政策，是决不能得逞的。美帝国主义在亚洲已经遭到惨重失败，自身难保，英国工党政府不惜把所谓“苏伊士以东”的“防务”同美国侵略亚洲的战线连结起来，企图指靠美国的力量来保持它在“苏伊士以东”的殖民利益，这不但一定会落空，而且必然会连它的老本都赔光，到头来成为美帝国主义的殉葬品。
