    The US Atomic Energy Commission's Report to US Congress Shows
    US Desperately Expanding Nuclear Armaments and Intensifying Nuclear War Preparations
    Conducts Fourth Underground Nuclear Test This Year in Nevada
    Xinhua News Agency, 1st – Washington News: Just as representatives of the US government are playing tricks with "preventing nuclear proliferation" and "completely banning nuclear tests" at the Geneva Seventeen-Nation Disarmament Conference, the US Atomic Energy Commission makes no secret of the fact that the US is desperately improving and expanding its nuclear armaments, and intensifying preparations for nuclear war.
    The US Atomic Energy Commission submitted an annual report to Congress on January 31. This report boasted of the "achievements" the US has made in preparing for nuclear war. It said that the US is "leading" in "nuclear defense"; it "has improved various types of nuclear weapons," for example, the US nuclear weapon stockpile last year added improved new varieties such as atomic landmines.
    The report indicates that the US will continue to follow this path in the future. It said that American "nuclear weapons experts are even now working on more advanced types (of nuclear weapons)"; and "increasing" the "penetration capability" of strategic missile warheads against "anti-ballistic missile measures" is "a major goal" in this regard.
    The report does not conceal the US's use of the convenience provided by the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty signed by the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union to develop nuclear weapons. It said that it continued to implement an "aggressive" plan last year, and has conducted "field tests" to test the "durability" of improved nuclear devices, "and is preparing for further tests."
    The US Atomic Energy Commission's report also blatantly threatens that the US has further enhanced its "preparedness to resume testing in the atmosphere," so that it can be used once the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is abandoned and the US decides to resume atmospheric nuclear testing.
    Xinhua News Agency, 4th – Washington News: The US Atomic Energy Commission announced that on the afternoon of the 3rd, the US conducted another underground nuclear weapons test at the Nevada Test Site.
    This is the fourth nuclear weapon test officially announced by the US this year, and the sixty-first test since the signing of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in August 1963.

    美原子能委员会向美国会提出的报告表明
    美国拼命扩充核军备加紧准备核战争
    又在内华达进行今年以来第四次地下核试验
    新华社一日讯　华盛顿消息：正当美国政府的代表在日内瓦十七国裁军会议上玩弄什么“防止核扩散”、“全面禁止核试验”把戏的时候，美国原子能委员会却毫不讳言美国正在拼命改善和扩充核军备，加紧准备核战争。
    美国原子能委员会一月三十一日向国会提出了一篇年度报告。这篇报告吹嘘美国在准备核战争方面所取得的“成就”。它说，美国在“核防务”中“领先”；它“已经改进了各种不同类型的核武器”，例如，去年美国的核武器储存中就增加了象原子地雷这类经过了改进的新品种。
    报告表示，美国今后还要沿着这条道路走下去。它说，美国的“核武器专家甚至在现在也正在为更加先进的类型（的核武器）而工作”；而“增进”战略导弹弹头对“反弹道导弹措施”的“穿透能力”，则是这方面的“一个主要目标”。
    这个报告并不掩饰美国利用美英苏三国部分禁止核试验条约所提供的方便来发展核武器。它说，去年继续执行了一个“进取性”的计划，已经为试验改善了的核装置的“耐力”进行了“现场试验，并且正在准备进一步的试验”。
    美国原子能委员会的报告还明目张胆地威胁说，美国已经进一步增进了它“在大气层恢复试验的准备能力”，以备一旦部分禁止核试验条约遭到废弃而美国决定恢复大气层核试验时就可以使用它。
    新华社四日讯　华盛顿消息：美国原子能委员会宣布，三日下午，美国又在内华达试验场进行了一次地下核武器试验。
    这是今年以来美国官方宣布的第四次核武器试验，也是一九六三年八月部分禁止核武器试验条约签订以来的第六十一次试验。
