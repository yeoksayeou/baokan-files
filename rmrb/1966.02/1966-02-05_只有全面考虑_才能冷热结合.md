    Only Comprehensive Consideration
    Can Combine Hot and Cold

    When we handle any matter, we must consider it comprehensively and overcome one-sidedness. This is especially true when leading the campaign to increase production and practice economy during a production upsurge. Only through comprehensive consideration can we combine "hot" enthusiasm with "cold" analysis, and be cool-headed promoters.

    When formulating this year's production plan, the Shanghai Dyestuff Factory set a target of 200 tons for the Tobias acid workshop and did not agree to the workshop's request to raise the target. This is an example of comprehensive consideration and being a cool-headed promoter.

    Initially, the cadres of the Tobias acid workshop felt that this target could not only be completed but also exceeded, and they worried whether the target was too conservative and would dampen the enthusiasm of the masses. However, the factory leaders did not see it that way. They made a comprehensive consideration of the issue: First, one should not only consider one's own production capacity, but also consider the raw material supply situation, and the supply of Tobias acid raw materials is limited; second, one should not only consider increasing output, but also consider ensuring quality, increasing yield, increasing labor productivity, and reducing costs; third, the trial of the new process route has not yet been successful, and the possibility of increased production is not yet a reality, so there should be room for maneuver in the plan. Of course, the factory leaders anticipated the possibility of the Tobias acid production task being completed ahead of schedule, which would allow the workshop to produce high-grade plastic pigments that the country urgently needs. Heroes will not be left without a stage to perform.

    The leaders of the Shanghai Dyestuff Factory considered well and arranged well. Doing so can fully embody the spirit of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and will not only not dampen the enthusiasm of the masses but will precisely guide the enthusiasm of the masses in the right direction.

    If problems are considered not comprehensively but one-sidedly, one might think that a higher output target is always better than a lower one, and there might be a phenomenon of "pressing down targets" without leaving room for maneuver and without considering conditions, which is of course a kind of one-sidedness. Production struggle is a complex matter. If only one aspect is considered and not the other, for example, if only needs are considered and not possibilities, or if only quantity is considered and not quality, then such a production plan will not conform to objective reality. If such a plan is forcibly implemented, it will inevitably dampen the enthusiasm of the masses.

    Leaders should, of course, humbly listen to opinions from below, but this does not mean that whatever the lower levels want to do, they should be allowed to do. Leaders should stand higher and see further, that is, they should consider more comprehensively: they should not only think enough about subjective factors, but also thoroughly understand objective conditions; they should not only see all the favorable conditions but also think about various difficult factors. This attitude of comprehensive consideration is the scientific attitude, and this spirit of seriousness and responsibility is the revolutionary spirit.

    只有全面考虑
    才能冷热结合
    我们办任何事情，都要全面考虑，克服片面性。在生产高潮中，领导增产节约运动，尤其要这样。只有全面考虑，才能冷热结合，才能做冷静的促进派。
    上海染料厂在制订今年的增产计划的时候，给吐氏酸工段定了二百吨的指标，没有同意这个工段提高指标的要求。这就是全面考虑，做冷静促进派的一例。
    吐氏酸工段的干部起初觉得这项指标不仅可以完成，而且可以超过，就顾虑这个指标是不是保守了，会不会挫伤群众的积极性？这个厂的领导者却不这样看。他们对这个问题作了全面考虑：第一、不能只考虑自己的生产能力，还要考虑原料供应状况，而吐氏酸的原料供应是有限的；第二、不能只考虑提高产量，还要考虑保证质量，提高收得率，提高劳动生产率，降低成本；第三、新的工艺路线的试验还没有成功，增产的可能性还不是现实性，做计划应该留有余地。当然，厂的领导预计到了吐氏酸生产任务提早完成的可能，这就正好让这个工段生产国家急需的高级塑料颜料。英雄不会无用武之地。
    上海染料厂的领导者考虑得好，安排得好。这样做，才能全面体现多快好省的总路线的精神，不但不会挫伤群众的积极性，正是把群众的积极性引导到正确的方向。
    如果不是全面地而是片面地考虑问题，就可能以为产量指标总是高比低好，就可能产生不留余地、不顾条件地“压指标”的现象，这当然是一种片面性。生产斗争是一件复杂的事，如果只考虑一面，不考虑另一面，例如，只考虑需要，不考虑可能，只考虑数量，不考虑质量，这样的生产计划就不会符合客观实际。如果硬要执行这样的计划，就必然挫伤群众的积极性。
    领导者对来自下面的意见当然要虚心听取，但是，这并不等于下面要怎么办就怎么办。领导者应该站得更高，看得更远，也就是要考虑得更全面：既要把主观的因素想够，也要把客观的条件摸透，既要看到一切有利条件，也要想到各种困难因素。这种全面考虑的态度，才是科学的态度，这种严肃认真的精神，就是革命的精神。
