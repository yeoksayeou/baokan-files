　　Once You've Identified It, Grab It and "Never Let Go"
　　Zhao Peide, Party Branch Secretary of the Zhao Duolou Brigade, Zhang Junmu Commune, Lankao County

    Zhao Duolou was originally a low-lying, flood-prone, disaster-stricken area where rain caused flooding, wind brought sand, and people were poor and livestock were few. From 1960 to 1963, it suffered continuous disasters, with seven seasons of near total crop failure. The masses relied on state-controlled sales for grain and on relief for money to buy clothing. Under these circumstances, although we had carried out some drainage projects according to the county party committee's arrangements, we didn't do enough due to a fearful mentality. We were afraid of the disaster, and we could not fundamentally eliminate the threat of waterlogging. Coupled with the serious wind and sand, we were even more helpless. In 1963, just when our brigade was suffering from severe natural disasters, Comrade Jiao Yulu repeatedly came to our brigade to stay, braving the rain, and selflessly joined the masses of the entire brigade in the intense fight against waterlogging. At first, the masses did not know he was the county party secretary. By the time everyone knew he was Secretary Jiao, he had become a mud man, no different from the poor and lower-middle peasants in the fight against the disaster. His actions greatly encouraged the anti-disaster enthusiasm of the party members, cadres, and masses of the entire brigade.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu went out in the wind and rain. After repeated in-depth investigations and visits, he knew everything about the terrain and geology of every piece of land in Zhao Duolou, the direction of the floods, the location of windbreaks, and the distribution of sand dunes. On August 18, 1963, Comrade Jiao Yulu came to our brigade in the rain, and his clothes were all soaked. At that time, I was busy holding a meeting, and he said gently: "Don't rush, you continue the meeting, I'll go to another room, and we'll talk after the meeting." After saying that, he left. The meeting was about to end, and I went to ask him to speak at the meeting. As soon as I went out, I saw him standing in a waterlogged depression south of the brigade headquarters, and the rain was still falling. I walked up to him and said: "Secretary Jiao, please speak to everyone!" He said: "I'm not going to talk at this meeting. If your work is arranged, hurry up and let them go and do it separately. You come and walk around with me later..." As he spoke, he walked to the edge of the waterlogged land. I quickly arranged the work for the meeting participants and sent them away, then returned to him. At this time, he pulled a soybean seedling from the waterlogged depression and said: "Old Zhao, what good soybeans! Waist-deep, it's a pity to drown them." Comrade Jiao Yulu then pointed his hand to the south and said: "Dig a north-south ditch from there to here, and the water in this depression can be drained, and it may be possible to save this good patch of soybeans." We walked south for a while, and Comrade Jiao Yulu asked me: "Old Zhao, tell me, why does your brigade suffer disasters year after year, what are the main roots of the disaster?" I said: "The main roots of the disaster are waterlogging and wind and sand." "Right! Right! You're right!" Comrade Jiao Yulu said repeatedly: "Old Zhao, since you've identified it, you should grab it hard. You must grab it and never let go. You must mobilize the poor and lower-middle peasants, think of more ways, and make a plan to remove the roots of the disaster." We watched and walked, and finished visiting five of the six villages in the entire brigade. He carefully observed the terrain and meticulously studied the flow of the water. At each place, he put forward practical suggestions based on local conditions. At the west of Huihuiying, he said: "You can dig a north-south ditch here." At the north of Zhuanxiangmiao Village, he said: "You can dig an east-west ditch here." At the east of Zhao Duolou Village, he said: "You should dig two north-south ditches there." Under the specific guidance of Comrade Jiao Yulu, we held a series of meetings, mobilized the masses, and launched a struggle against flooding.
    After more than ten days of hard work, we drained the water, and 5,500 mu of the 5,900 mu of crops flooded in the entire brigade were saved. Comrade Jiao Yulu praised us and said: "The enthusiasm of the Zhao Duolou commune members is really great, it is worth learning from throughout the county." Later, he held an on-site meeting in our brigade and called on the entire county to learn from the "Zhao Duolou spirit." Comrade Jiao Yulu's praise further encouraged the enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasant commune members of our brigade to overcome waterlogging. Our party branch grasped the removal of waterlogging and "never let go," and continuously carried out the struggle to remove waterlogging.
    Over the past year or so, following the teachings of Comrade Jiao Yulu, relying on the masses, and summarizing the practical experience of the masses in the struggle against waterlogging, from digging rivers to drain water to the combination of three ditches -- river ditches, road ditches, and field moisture ditches -- we have found a set of methods to completely eradicate waterlogging disasters. We have dug a total of 475 large and small ditches and rivers, and built 330 mu of strip fields in some waterlogged depressions, basically eliminating the threat of waterlogging.
    Wind and sand are the second major disaster in our brigade. We relied on the masses to launch a tenacious struggle against wind and sand, but due to unclear directions and insufficient determination, we have not been able to avoid the harm of wind and sand. One morning in the winter of 1963, Comrade Jiao Yulu came to Zhao Duolou. He did not rest, but led several cadres of our brigade to run in the frozen fields. We walked past wheat fields one after another, stepped over autumn harvest land after autumn harvest land, and came to a sand ridge at the head of Sanyizhai Village. Comrade Jiao Yulu pointed to a wheat field in front of the village and said with satisfaction: "Old Zhao! Your wheat seedlings are growing well this year. You should strengthen management in the future and strive for a bumper wheat harvest!" "The wheat seedlings do look good," I said happily but worriedly, "The wheat seedlings were also good last year, but they were all destroyed by a few strong winds later." After hearing my words, he immediately asked: "Have you thought of a way to prevent wind?" I said: "This large sand dune, when the wind blows, the sand flies, and there is no way to solve it yet." As soon as I mentioned the large sand dune, Secretary Jiao said: "How about sealing the sand dune with silt? You can try it." As he spoke, he stared at me, and seeing my hesitation, he further encouraged me and said: "I'll go back and discuss it with Comrade Zhang Qinli and ask him to help you with the experiment. If it succeeds, grab it hard, grab it tightly, and don't stop until all the sand dunes are sealed."
    Under the inspiration and encouragement of Comrade Jiao Yulu, the experiment of turning over silt and suppressing sand was successful. Therefore, according to Comrade Jiao Yulu's suggestion, we grasped sand control and "never let go." After a winter and spring of hard work and solid work, all 26 large sand dunes in the entire brigade were sealed with silt. Later, we also planted a large number of trees and a large number of *Lespedeza bicolor* on these sandy lands.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu has passed away, but we remember his words: "Grasp hard once you’ve identified the problem and never let go." As the Zhao Duolou Brigade, which was personally guided and cultivated by Comrade Jiao Yulu during his lifetime, we are determined to completely change the face of Zhao Duolou according to his requirements for us during his lifetime.

　　看准了，就抓住“死不丢”
　　兰考县张君墓公社赵垛楼大队党支部书记　赵培德
    赵垛楼，原来是个低洼易涝，遇雨成灾，风起沙飞，人穷畜少的老灾区。一九六○年到一九六三年，连续受灾，七季基本绝收，群众吃粮靠统销，花钱穿衣靠救济。在这种情况下，俺们虽然按照县委的布置，做了一些除涝工程，但是，由于思想上存在着灾大压头的畏难情绪，除涝工程做得很不够，不能从根本上解除内涝灾害的威胁，加上风沙严重，更使俺们束手无策了。一九六三年，正当俺队遭受严重自然灾害的时刻，焦裕禄同志曾多次冒雨来俺队住下，并且奋不顾身地同全队群众一起投入紧张的排涝斗争。开始，群众并不知道他是县委书记，当大家知道他是焦书记时，他已经变成了泥人，跟抗灾斗争中的贫农下中农并没有两样。他的行动，大大地鼓舞了全队党员、干部和群众的抗灾干劲。
    焦裕禄同志风里来雨里去，经过三番五次地深入调查访问，他对赵垛楼的每一块土地的地形、地质，洪水的来路去向，飞沙风口的所在，沙丘的分布状况，都了如指掌。一九六三年八月十八日，焦裕禄同志冒雨来到俺们大队，他的衣服全淋湿了。当时俺正忙着开会，他温和地说：“不忙，你继续开会，我到别的屋去，会后咱再谈。”说罢就走了。会快结束了，俺去请他在会议上讲讲话。一出门，就看见他在队部南边一片积水的洼地里站着，雨还继续在下。俺走到他跟前说：“焦书记，请你给大家讲讲吧！”他说：“我不准备在这个会上讲啥，你的工作如果布置完了，就赶快让他们分头去干，回头你跟我去转转……。”他说着就走到积水的地边去了。俺赶快把参加会议人员的工作安排好，打发他们走后，又回到他跟前。这时，他从洼地的积水里拉住一棵豆秧说：“老赵，多好的豆子！打腰深，淹死了多可惜。”焦裕禄同志接着把手朝南一指说：“从那里到这里挖一条南北沟，这片洼地的积水就可以排光，就可能救活这一片好豆子。”俺们又向南走了一段，焦裕禄同志问我：“老赵，你说说，你这大队为啥连年受灾，主要灾根是啥？”俺说：“主要灾根就是内涝和风沙。”“对！对！你说的对！”焦裕禄同志连声说：“老赵，既然看准了，就应该狠抓，要抓住死不丢，要发动贫下中农，多想办法，订个规划，把灾根除掉。”俺们看着走着，全大队六个村，转完了五个村。他仔细地观察着地形，细心地研究着水的流势。每到一处，他都因地制宜地提出切实的建议。到回回营西地，他说：“这里可以挖条南北沟。”到转香庙村北地，他说：“这里可以挖条东西沟。”到赵垛楼村东地，他说：“那里应该挖两条南北沟。”在焦裕禄同志的具体指导下，俺们召开了一系列的会议，发动群众，开展了抗洪斗争。
    经过十多天的苦战，俺们将积水排走了，全大队五千九百亩被水淹的庄稼，有五千五百亩得救了。焦裕禄同志赞扬俺们说：“赵垛楼社员的干劲真大，值得全县学习。”后来，他就在俺队召开了现场会议，提出了全县学习“赵垛楼干劲”的号召。焦裕禄同志的表扬，更加鼓舞了俺大队贫下中农社员战胜涝灾的积极性。俺们党支部就抓住除涝“死不丢”，连续开展了除涝斗争。
    一年多来，俺们遵照焦裕禄同志的教导，依靠群众，总结群众除涝斗争中的实践经验，由挖河排水到三沟——河沟、路沟、地墒沟结合，找出了一套彻底根治涝灾的办法，前后共开挖了大小沟、河四百七十五条，在一些涝洼地，修建三百三十亩条田，基本上解除了涝灾的威胁。
    风沙，是俺大队的第二个大灾害。俺们依靠群众曾和风沙展开过顽强的斗争，但由于方向不明，决心不大，一直没有免除风沙危害。一九六三年冬天的一个上午，焦裕禄同志来到赵垛楼，他来到没有休息，就领着俺们大队几个干部，在封冻的田野上奔走。俺们走过一块接一块的麦田，踏过一块连一块的大秋地，来到了三义寨村头的一个沙岗上。焦裕禄同志指着村前的一块麦地，满意地说：“老赵！今年你们的麦苗长得不错呀，以后要加强管理，争取麦季丰收啊！”“看麦苗是不错”，俺高兴而又担心地说，“去年麦苗也不错，后来几场大风，就全部刮毁了。”他听了我的话，就紧接着问：“防风，你想到办法没有？”俺说：“这大沙丘，风起沙飞，还没法解决。”俺一提起大沙丘，焦书记就说：“淤泥把沙丘封闭起来怎么样，你们可以试试。”他说着盯了俺一眼，看俺犹豫不决，就进一步鼓劲说：“我回去和张钦礼同志商量一下，让他来帮助你们搞试验，如果成功了就狠抓，抓紧，不把沙丘全部封完，就抓住死不丢。”
    在焦裕禄同志的启发鼓舞下，翻淤压沙试验成功了。于是，俺们就按照焦裕禄同志的意见，抓住治沙“死不丢”，经过一个冬春的苦干实干，全大队二十六个大沙丘，全部用淤泥封闭了，随后俺们还在这些沙地上，栽上了大量的树木，种下了大批的腊条。
    焦裕禄同志逝世了，可是俺们牢记着他的话：“问题看准了就狠抓，要抓住死不丢”。作为焦裕禄同志生前亲自指导过，并一手培育起来的赵垛楼大队，俺们决心按照他生前对俺们的要求，一定彻底改变赵垛楼的面貌。
