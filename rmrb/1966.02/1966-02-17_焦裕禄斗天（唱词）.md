Green pines stand tall on the Kunlun Mountains, red plum blossoms bloom on the banks of the Yellow River, the sons and daughters of China are full of lofty aspirations, daring to teach the sun and moon to change the new sky. It sings of: County Party Secretary Jiao Yulu, with lofty aspirations fighting nature. His heart is red-dyed like the morning glow, his bones are hard-tempered by fierce fire, he is worthy of being Chairman Mao's good student, an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China! The cold wind is biting, that was still 1962, blood boiling, Jiao Yulu came to Lankao County, all along the way only saw saline-alkali wasteland white, all along the way only saw the Yellow River's old course sand diffuse, this year the whole county suffered the most serious disaster, this year the grain harvest greatly reduced. Jiao Yulu was sent by the Party Committee to fight the "Three Harms," holding the rudder steady to lead the masses to sail against the wind. At the county party committee, he opened "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," to grasp the steering wheel before starting; down to the village, he spoke heartfelt words in the thatched cottage, mobilizing the masses to row and raise the sails. Jiao Yulu stood tall and visionary against the wind, and said to the cadres and masses around him: "Our Lankao has more than 900,000 mu of land liberated by the martyrs, our Lankao has 360,000 hardworking and brave people, with Zhang Side's thorough revolutionary spirit as an example, and with the spirit of the Old Man Who Moved Mountains to inspire us, as long as we strengthen the leadership of the Party, I don't believe we can't defeat Heaven! We must resolutely break through the barriers and kill a path, we will not give up until we achieve our goal!" He came to patches of low-lying, wet, and waterlogged nests, determined to plant reeds, raise fish, and develop aquaculture; he stepped on seats of loose yellow sand dunes, determined to plant trees and create forests to build green beaches; he walked through blocks of saline-alkali barren land, determined to plant green seedlings to turn them into fertile fields. Heroic words echo in the sky, cadres' hearts are hot and tears sparkle, heroic words shake the plain, the masses roll up their sleeves and sharpen their fists.
    
    (White) This late at night, Comrade Jiao Yulu, filled with passion, tossed and turned unable to sleep, he put on his cotton coat and found Zhang Qinli, deputy secretary of the county party committee, to talk heart to heart until the first cock crowed. The common conclusion of the two was: To eliminate the "Three Harms," the key at present is the ideological revolutionization of leading cadres. Finally, Comrade Jiao Yulu said with deep meaning and affection: "We must have revolutionary courage to lead the people of the county to fight against the sky!" Jiao Yulu came back and re-opened the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to read, Chairman Mao's kind teachings resonated in his ears: Correct deployment comes from correct determination, correct determination comes from correct judgment, correct judgment comes from thorough reconnaissance, without investigation and research there is no right to speak! Each word like the morning sun rises from the horizon, each line like sunlight illuminates his heart. From then on Jiao Yulu followed the investigation team, vowing to weigh the disaster situation in Lankao with his own hands. At this time he was suffering from chronic liver disease, comrades often gently persuaded him to stop, but he said "Eating other people's chewed steamed buns has no taste, what kind of commander is it if you don't go to the front line!" Look at him, carrying dry food on his shoulder and holding an umbrella in his hand, look at him, Mao Zedong's works pasted on his chest, he took the lead in checking the wind direction in the turbid flying sand, he took the lead in measuring dangerous beaches in the misty rain, crawling in the mud and rolling in the water, enduring hardship and sweetness like honey, chasing the wind and seeking water, the journey of thousands of miles does not feel far! On this day, rumbling thunder followed by flashes of lightning, and a howling wind followed by continuous rain. Jiao Yulu had been waiting for this extraordinary rainstorm for a long time, and he immediately led three young people to explore the water situation. Heaven connected to water, water connected to heaven, no trace of the road, birds broken. Jiao Yulu walked ahead in the water with a stick, suddenly liver pain like a steel knife cut, clenched his fist against the liver he straightened his chest, gritted his teeth to endure the pain and continued to move forward!
    
    (White) At that time, the three young comrades saw it in their eyes and felt pain in their hearts, they begged: "Secretary Jiao, go back and rest! We guarantee to complete the task according to your requirements!" Jiao Yulu raised his right hand to wipe the rain from his face, and smiled and said a word: "Go!" The swirling torrent could not disrupt his firm steps, the torrential rain could not extinguish the flame in his heart! The young people opened a red umbrella for Secretary Jiao, under the umbrella he drew the water situation on paper, he could not finish drawing his ambition to fight the sky, he could not finish drawing the ditches and embankments all over the place to control the water, he drew directly to the Jin Ying Production Brigade, and handed the drawings to the branch secretary. After studying a new plan for digging rivers, building embankments, and preventing floods, Secretary Li persuaded him to eat a hot meal to warm up. Jiao Yulu only had the two words "People" in his heart, how could he care about personal hunger and cold at this time and place. In a flash he re-embarked on the journey to the front line, his tall figure disappeared in the swaying wind and rain! Once bid farewell to the spring in the wind and sand, and sent away the summer in the rain, the investigation team traveled five thousand miles, the county party committee figured out the root causes of the "Three Harms." Once a blueprint is made, all the people are mobilized with one heart. Before the fierce battle, Jiao Yulu's thoughts were surging and difficult to calm down, in the deep of night, he carefully studied Mao Zedong's works again, reading a sentence, a ray of red light flashed before his eyes, reciting it once, a piece of golden light reflected in his heart:
    
    (White) "We communists must adopt two methods in whatever work we do: one is the combination of the general and the individual, and the other is the combination of leadership and the masses." Learning this, the scenes of Jiao Yulu's investigation and visits to poor and lower-middle peasants during the day were suddenly drawn out by Chairman Mao's words, and kept "playing movies" in his mind. After thinking for a long time, he understood and said softly: "Yes!" "I will do what Chairman Mao says!" The next day Jiao Yulu moved into the thatched cottage of the poor peasants again. Sleeping on the same kang with the masses, eating from the same pot with the masses, exchanging sweat with the masses, and connecting their red hearts tightly with the masses. Braving the cold wind and facing the cold moon, he led the members of Hancun Commune to cut grass, welcoming the morning sun and stepping on the morning dew, he led the members of Qinzai Commune to make alkali, he sowed the seeds in the land of Zhaoduolou, he sweated in the ditches of Shuangyangshu. Spring blossoms and autumn fruits, summer heat and winter cold, ice locks the Yellow River, snow fills the Central Plains, when the masses encountered the greatest difficulties, he always appeared in front of the masses in time. On a cold winter night with heavy snow, Jiao Yulu was concerned about the lives and property of the people: Could the old poor peasant's thatched cottage in Qinglonggang have been blown by wind and snow? Could the five-guarantee household in Dafutang have run out of fuel? Is the earthen hut of the Old Hanling Nursery warm? Is the cowshed of Tuzhaizhai cold? Before dawn, Secretary Jiao braved the wind and snow to visit relatives, and the cadres followed with relief grain and money. Difficult to walk? More difficult than the Red Army's Long March climbing snow mountains, firm determination! Firmly want to sing a song "Nanniwan". On this day Jiao Yulu visited nine villages and poor peasant households, and Mao Zedong Thought warmed the hearts of the people of the county. The commune members said: We will gnaw the alkali land until it is turned over with our mouths! The commune members said: We will hold up the flood with our hands! Jiao Yulu exhausted his red heart for the people, and the people closely followed Old Jiao to fight the sky! Seeing the spirit of self-reliance in Hancun is being promoted, seeing the determination of Qinzhai to forge ahead is being realized, the hard-working spirit of Zhaoduolou is even higher, and the road to collective prosperity in Shuangyangshu is even smoother. But only see the face of Lankao County getting better day by day, but do not know that Jiao Yulu's health is getting worse day by day. Jiao Yulu poured his heart and soul into Lankao, Jiao Yulu endured all kinds of difficulties for Lankao. The evil disease demon took away a hoe from his hand, but could not take away his revolutionary courage to fight and conquer the earth; on the sickbed he insisted on clutching a steel pen tightly, establishing a lofty aspiration to write a strange article "Dare to Teach the Sun and Moon to Change the New Sky"; the evil disease demon took away a pen from his hand, but could not take away his revolutionary loyal soul that swallowed rivers and mountains!
    
    (White) On May 14, 1964, Chairman Mao's good student, an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China - Comrade Jiao Yulu unfortunately passed away due to illness. However, his revolutionary spirit of swallowing mountains and rivers will always live in our hearts. Comrade Jiao Yulu said on his deathbed: "I have only one request after I die, to ask the organization to transport me back to Lankao and bury me on the beach, I did not cure the sand dunes while I was alive, and I will watch you cure the sand dunes after I die!" Green pines are towering, red plums are bright red, peaks are jagged, the sea is vast! Winter snow weaves brocade to express your condolences, spring thunder plays music to praise you. Good comrade, you lived without regret and died without complaint, good comrade-in-arms, you sleep peacefully under the earth! See Lankao's waterlogged nests have been transformed into reed ponds and fish ponds, see Lankao's yellow sand dunes have been transformed into green forests and beaches, see Lankao's saline-alkali land has been transformed into fertile fields, see Lankao's old days have been replaced by a new sky! Mourn you, Jiao Yulu, a towering and upright hero, learn from you, Jiao Yulu, a good example of a revolutionary soldier. We will always read "Selected Works of Mao Zedong", and we will undertake the cause of communism! Rejoice that today's rivers and mountains are so beautiful, looking forward to tomorrow's five continents and four seas full of red sky!

    焦裕禄斗天（唱词）
    郑彦平　宋振涛青松巍立昆仑山，红梅怒放黄河畔，中华儿女多奇志，敢教日月换新天。唱的是：县委书记焦裕禄，壮志凌云斗自然。他心红朝霞染，他骨硬烈火炼，不愧为毛主席的好学生，中国共产党的优秀党员！寒风凛冽，那还是一九六二年，热血沸腾，焦裕禄来到兰考县，一路上只见盐碱荒滩白茫茫，一路上只见黄河故道沙漫漫，这一年全县受灾最严重，这一年粮食收成大减产。焦裕禄受党委派前来战“三害”，掌稳舵领导群众同开顶风船。到县委他翻开《毛泽东选集》，未曾启航先握定方向盘；下村寨他草庵里谈心地头上讲，发动群众摇橹划桨升起帆。焦裕禄高瞻远瞩迎风立，对身边干部、群众开了言：“咱兰考有先烈解放的土地九十多
  万亩，咱兰考有勤劳勇敢的人民三十六
  万，有张思德彻底革命精神作榜样，有老愚公移山的干劲鼓舞咱，只要加强党的领导，我就不信斗不过天！坚决要闯关斩将杀出一条路，不达到目的我们死也不心甘！”他来到片片低湿涝洼窝，决心要栽苇养鱼搞水产；他踏上座座松散黄沙丘，决心要植树造林建绿滩；他走过块块盐碱生荒地，决心要种上青苗变良田。豪言荡长空干部心热泪花闪，壮语震平川群众擦掌又磨拳。
    （白）这天夜半时分，焦裕禄同志满怀激情，辗转反侧不能入眠，他披上棉衣，找到县委副书记张钦礼促膝长谈，直到鸡叫头遍。两人共同的结论是：要除“三害”，眼下的关键乃是领导干部的思想革命化。最后，焦裕禄同志意重情长地说：“我们一定要有革命的胆略，领导全县人民与天斗争！”焦裕禄回来重把《毛泽东选集》打开看，毛主席亲切教导响耳边：正确部署来源于正确的决心，正确的决心来源于正确的判断，正确的判断来源于周密的侦察，没有调查研究就没有发言权！一字字象晨曦升自地平线，一行行象阳光照亮他心坎。从此后焦裕禄跟随调查队，誓把这兰考的灾情亲手掂一掂。这时节他正患慢性肝脏病，同志们常婉言相劝把他拦，他却说“吃别人嚼过的馍没味道，不上前线还算什么指挥员！”你看他，肩背干粮手拿伞，你看他，毛主席著作贴胸前，黄沌沌飞沙狂他带头查风口，白蒙蒙落雨急他带头测险滩，泥里爬水里滚含辛茹苦甜似蜜，追风踪觅水向征途千里不觉远！这一天，轰隆隆雷声过后电光闪，呼啦啦狂风起时雨连绵。焦裕禄早就等着这场特大暴风雨，他立即带领三个青年去把水势探。天连着水，水连着天，路无踪，飞鸟断。焦裕禄拄棍前边趟水走，骤然间肝疼好似钢刀剜，攥紧拳顶住肝部他挺起胸，咬紧牙忍住苦痛继续向前！
      （白）当时，三位青年同志看在眼里，疼在心上，他们恳求着说：“焦书记，您回去休息吧！我们保证按照您的要求完成任务！”焦裕禄举起右手抹去脸上的雨水，微笑着说出了一个字：“走！”激流回旋冲不乱他坚定的脚步，大雨滂沱浇不灭他心中的火焰！青年们为焦书记张开红雨伞，雨伞下他把水势画在纸上边，画不完斗天的满腹鸿鹄凌云志，画不完治水的遍地河沟与堤坎，直画到金营生产大队部，把图纸交到支书手里边。研究罢挖河筑堤防洪新方案，李支书劝他吃顿热饭暖一暖。焦裕禄心中只有“人民”两个字，那顾得此时此地个人受饥寒。霎时间他重登征途奔前线，高大的身影消失在风雨飘摇间！曾辞别风沙里的春季，又送走雨水中的夏天，调查队长途跋涉五千里，县委摸透了“三害”根源。一张蓝图制定好，万众齐心总动员。激战前，焦裕禄思潮起伏难平静，夜深沉，再将毛主席著作细钻研，读一句，一缕红光眼前闪，念一遍，一片金辉映丹田：
      （白）“我们共产党人无论进行何项工作，有两个方法是必须采用的，一是一般和个别相结合，二是领导和群众相结合。”学到这里，焦裕禄同志白天调查访问贫下中农的情景，一下子被毛主席的话引了出来，不停地在脑海里“过电影”。思索良久，他心领神会地轻声说道：“对呀！”“毛主席怎么说我就怎么办！”第二天焦裕禄又住进贫农茅草庵。和群众同睡一条炕，和群众同吃一锅饭，和群众热汗常交流，和群众红心紧相连。冒寒风顶冷月他带韩村社员去割
  草，迎朝阳踏晨露他带秦寨社员去制
  碱，赵垛楼的土地有他播的种，双杨树的水渠有他流的汗。春华秋实，夏暑冬寒，冰锁黄河，雪漫中原，当群众遇到最大困难时，他总是及时出现群众前。在一个大雪拥门的寒冬夜，焦裕禄挂念着人民生命和财产：青龙冈老贫农茅屋可曾进风雪？大付堂五保户家里可曾断炊烟？老韩陵苗圃的地庵暖不暖？土山寨耕牛的草棚寒不寒？天未明焦书记冒风顶雪去探亲，干部们带着救灾粮款随后边。举步难？难不过红军长征爬雪山，决心硬！硬是要高歌一曲《南泥湾》。这一天焦裕禄走访九个村寨贫农
  户，毛泽东思想把全县群众的心温暖。社员说：用嘴啃也把碱地啃翻个儿！社员说：用手捧也把洪水给捧干！焦裕禄掏尽红心为人民，人民都紧跟老焦来斗天！眼看韩村的自力更生精神在发扬，眼看秦寨的奋发图强决心在实现，赵垛楼艰苦奋斗的干劲更高涨，双杨树集体富裕的道路更平坦。但只见兰考县面貌一日好似一日，却不知焦裕禄病体一天不如一天。焦裕禄为兰考呕心沥血，焦裕禄为兰考历尽艰难。恶病魔夺走了他手中一把镐，夺不走他斗天搏地浑身革命胆；在病榻他坚持紧攥着铁笔一杆，立奇志写奇文《敢教日月换新天》；恶病魔又夺走他手中一枝笔，夺不走他革命忠魂气吞河山！
      （白）一九六四年五月十四日，毛主席的好学生、中国共产党的优秀党员——焦裕禄同志不幸病逝了。但是，他气吞山河的革命精神，将永远活在我们心间。焦裕禄同志临终时说：“我死后只有一个要求，要求组织上把我运回兰考，埋在沙滩上，活着我没有治好沙丘，死了也要看着你们把沙丘治好！”青松巍巍，红梅丹丹，高峰嶙峋，大海浩瀚！冬雪织素锦为你志哀，春雷奏鼓乐为你礼赞。好同志，你生无愧来死无怨，好战友，你在大地之下长安眠！看兰考涝洼窝已变成苇塘鱼池，看兰考黄沙丘已变成林海绿滩，看兰考盐碱地已变成良田沃土，看兰考旧日月已换新天！悼念你，焦裕禄，顶天立地英雄汉，学习你，焦裕禄，革命战士好样板。《毛泽东选集》我们永远读，共产主义大业我们承担！喜今日江山多娇美如画，看明朝五洲四海红满天！
