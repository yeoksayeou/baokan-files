    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 8th (Report): According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front issued a statement on the 5th, expressing its full endorsement of the solemn stance clarified by President Ho Chi Minh in his letter to the heads of many countries on January 24th. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    In recent months, following successive military and political defeats on various battlefields, the American authorities have incessantly trumpeted their worn-out so-called "peace efforts." President Johnson has repeatedly proclaimed so-called "unconditional discussions," "fully utilizing all possibilities for peace," and "America's unremitting pursuit of peace." Senior politicians of the American government have been active in all directions with many "new peace proposals," and the American government has even used the means of "suspending the bombing of North Vietnam" to demonstrate its "sincerity," and so on.
    But on the other hand, at the same time, the American aggressors have massively used B-52 strategic bombers, artillery of all calibers, napalm bombs, phosphorus incendiary bombs, chemical poisons, and even poison gas as tools of war to massacre innocent people in South Vietnam. More cruelly and barbarically, at the beginning of 1966, following the towering crimes of the Park Chung-hee puppet troops devastating the entire Xinjiang Village (in Binh Dinh province), the American paratroopers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade conducted "sweeps" against Baozhai (Dike An) and many other areas, implementing a scorched-earth policy of "burn all, destroy all, and kill all" wherever they went. They were even more cruel and barbaric than the Hitler fascists and Japanese militarists during World War II. All the furniture, houses, and fields of our compatriots were destroyed by them. They massacred or arrested everyone they encountered, regardless of men, women, old or young. They massively used chemical poisons. In the seven months since the latter half of 1965 alone, tens of thousands of people in South Vietnam have been poisoned, and more than 700 square kilometers of crops have been destroyed. Recently, while American imperialism was lavishly talking about "peace negotiations," it spread chemical poisons everywhere in Ben Tre province, seriously poisoning 46,000 people. In Can Tho province, more than 4,000 people were poisoned and more than 10,000 hectares of crops were destroyed, with many deaths and many pregnant women suffering miscarriages. Even more blatant is that in the use of poison gas, it has progressed from not being public to being public, regarding this inhumane act as a "clearly defined principle" for each sweep. What is particularly serious is that in a very short period, the American imperialist aggressors and their lackeys have committed more and more heinous crimes, which are also happening in many different places at the same time, and are developing universally and extensively throughout South Vietnam.
    Even temples, schools, villages, or boats in the areas it controls have become targets of its bombing and strafing. Even when the American president is constantly clamoring for "peace efforts," the American government has sent an additional 13,000 invading troops to South Vietnam, and the Johnson-McNamara group has requested an additional several billion dollars to cover the expenses of the South Vietnam war. Many senior American officials have also successively come to South Vietnam to formulate plans to strengthen and expand the war of aggression. It is also at this time that American imperialism has constantly conducted reconnaissance and provocations against North Vietnam, and its actions have exposed the falseness of its so-called "peace sincerity." Recently, American imperialism has continued to send planes to barbarously bomb residential and industrial areas of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, an action that further exposes its warlike aggressive ambitions.
    The American Air Force has simultaneously stepped up attacks on the Laotian liberated areas, blatantly threatening to send troops to occupy central and lower Laos. The United States and its lackeys have also constantly infringed upon and threatened Cambodian territory, audaciously authorizing American troops to invade Cambodian territory at any time. It has also stepped up the establishment of military bases in Thailand, driving the Thai running dogs to participate in its war in the Indochina region.
    Obviously, American imperialism is continuing to slide down the extremely dangerous new military adventure path of strengthening the war of aggression against Vietnam, threatening peace in Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world. It is precisely when the American authorities are lavishly talking about "peace" that they are doing everything they can to intensify activities to expand the war of aggression. It is in the days when they are noisily peddling deceitful "peace efforts" that they are intensifying the war of aggression more than ever.
    The thousand-year history of Vietnam's nation-building clearly proves that whenever the motherland is subjected to foreign aggression, the entire Vietnamese nation unites to rise up and take up arms to resist the enemy, and finally achieve glorious victory. The South Vietnamese people's anti-American struggle for national salvation today is a national liberation struggle conducted by the broad masses of people from all walks of life under the correct leadership of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front. All the people of South Vietnam, regardless of ethnicity, religion, political party, or political inclination, unite around the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, stand up and resolutely oppose the common enemy - the American imperialist aggressors. Where there is oppression, there is struggle. American imperialism's aggression war in South Vietnam is bound to be resisted by the South Vietnamese people, who have a strong and unyielding tradition of resisting foreign aggression and who, together with their compatriots across the country, fought and defeated French colonialism, taking up arms against it.
    It is very clear that the deep-rooted and direct causes of the cruel war currently in South Vietnam come from the American imperialism's policy of aggression. All the arguments that reverse black and white, such as Vietnamese "invading Vietnam" and "the North invading the South," are shameless slanders that cannot deceive anyone.
    The South Vietnamese people's united and unanimous sacred war of national salvation is just and of great international significance, so it has won the moral and material support of many countries in the world, and of course, it also receives the full support of 17 million blood brothers and sisters in the North.
    For more than ten years, the South Vietnamese people have never been afraid of sacrifice or hardship, and have resolutely carried out the struggle for national salvation to realize the most basic and sacred wishes of their nation, which is to drive out the foreign aggressors, strive for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and then unify the motherland. The establishment of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front and its reasonable and comprehensive program correctly and fully embody this legitimate desire of all the people of South Vietnam, so it can unite people from all walks of life in South Vietnam with different political inclinations. The South Vietnam National Liberation Front is the organizer and leader of the South Vietnamese people's war of resistance for national salvation. It is fighting to realize the basic national rights and ardent wishes of the 14 million compatriots in the South, and it has been and is giving heavy blows to the American imperialist aggressors on various battlefields. As the leader of the patriotic war of resistance for national independence of the entire people - the South Vietnam National Liberation Front - is the only true representative of the 14 million South Vietnamese people. As for those so-called "Saigon regime" groups that are fostered or overthrown by the United States according to its needs, obediently implementing all the policies and propositions of American imperialism's aggression, strengthening and expanding the war, they cannot survive for even a day without American troops, weapons, and dollars. They cannot represent anyone except traitors.
    Now, the South Vietnam National Liberation Front actually controls five-fourths of the South Vietnamese territory with over ten million people. All progressive organizations, international conferences, and people in the world recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the only true representative of the South Vietnamese people, representing the sacred national rights and wishes of the South Vietnamese people. Any solution to the South Vietnam issue without the decisive voice and position of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front is invalid.
    The Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front fully agrees with the very clear and correct position of the North Vietnamese compatriots clarified in the letter of President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam this January 24.
    If American imperialism truly respects the Geneva Accords, it must withdraw all the American and its puppet troops from South Vietnam.
    If American imperialism truly wants peace, it cannot but recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, which is fighting the anti-aggression war, as the only true representative of the South Vietnamese people.
    If American imperialism truly respects the South Vietnamese people's right to national self-determination, it cannot but recognize the program of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front for the struggle to realize the independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and then unification of the motherland of South Vietnam. This program is the legitimate wish of the 14 million South Vietnamese people.
    The Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front solemnly reiterates: The consistent position of the South Vietnamese people is that as long as American imperialism does not recognize the South Vietnamese people's rights to national independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and then unification of the motherland, does not withdraw all the American and its puppet troops and weapons from South Vietnam, and withdraw its various military bases in South Vietnam, allowing the South Vietnamese people to solve their own internal affairs, does not immediately, unconditionally, and permanently stop the bombing of North Vietnam, and recognizes the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the only true representative of the South Vietnamese people, then the South Vietnamese people under the leadership of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front must still hold the guns in their hands, no matter how much sacrifice is required and how much hardship is endured, no matter whether they have to fight for ten, twenty years, or longer, they must continue to fight resolutely until the most sacred and basic wishes of the South Vietnamese people are realized. The South Vietnamese people will surely win! The American aggressors and their running dogs will surely be defeated!

### 越南南方民族解放阵线中央主席团发表声明  完全赞同胡志明主席信中阐明的严正立场  南越人民不怕牺牲不畏艰苦决心战斗到底

    越南南方民族解放阵线中央主席团发表声明
    完全赞同胡志明主席信中阐明的严正立场
    南越人民不怕牺牲不畏艰苦决心战斗到底
    新华社河内八日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团五日发表声明，表示完全赞同胡志明主席在一月二十四日写给许多国家首脑的信中所阐明的严正立场。声明全文如下：
    最近几个月来，继在各个战场上遭到军事和政治方面的连续失败之后，美国当局不断地大肆宣扬它陈旧不堪的所谓“和平努力”，约翰逊总统接连宣称所谓“无条件讨论”“充分发挥一切和平的可能性”和“美国不懈地谋求和平”。美国政府的高级政客带着许多“新的和平建议”四出活动，美国政府甚至还用了“暂停轰炸北越”的手段，以表示自己的“诚意”，等等。
    但另一方面，在同一时间内，美国侵略者大规模使用B—52型战略轰炸机、各种口径大炮、凝固汽油弹、磷质燃烧弹、化学毒药、甚至毒气作为战争工具来残杀越南南方的无辜人民。更加残暴和野蛮的是，在一九六六年年初，继朴正熙仆从军摧残整个新江村（在平定省）的滔天罪行之后，第一七三空降旅的美国伞兵又对保寨（堤岸）和其它许多地区进行“扫荡”，所到之处，实行“烧光、毁光和杀光”的焦土政策，他们比第二次世界大战时期的希特勒法西斯和日本军国主义更加残暴和野蛮。我们同胞的所有家具、房屋和田园都被他们摧毁。他们残杀或逮捕所遇到的一切人，不分男女老少。他们大规模地使用化学毒药。仅在一九六五年下半年以来的七个月里，就有数以万计的越南南方人民中毒，七百平方公里以上的庄稼被摧残。最近，当美帝国主义侈谈“和平谈判”的时候，它在槟椥省到处撒放化学毒药，使四万六千人严重中毒。在芹苴省也有四千多人中毒和一万多公顷庄稼被摧毁，许多人死亡，许多孕妇流产。更加明目张胆的是，在使用毒气方面，它已经从不公开发展到公开，把这一惨无人道的行动看作是给各次扫荡“明确规定了的原则”，特别严重的是，在一个很短的时间里，美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗越来越多地犯下天地所不容的罪恶，这些罪恶行为又是在同一时间内发生在许多不同的地方，而且普遍和广泛地向整个越南南方发展。
    甚至它控制的地区里的寺庙、学校、村庄或船只，也都成了它轰炸、扫射的目标。就是在美国总统不停地为“和平努力”而叫嚣的时候，美国政府又向越南南方增派一万三千名侵略军，约翰逊—麦克纳马拉集团又要求增拨数十亿美元，作为南越战争的开支。美国许多高级官员也接连地来到越南南方，制订加强和扩大侵略战争的计划。也正是在这个时候，美帝国主义不断对越南北方进行侦察和挑衅，它的行动自我暴露了所谓“和平诚意”的虚假面目。最近，美帝国主义又继续派遣飞机野蛮地轰炸越南民主共和国居民区和工业区，这一行动更加暴露了它的好战的侵略野心。
    美国空军同时加紧袭击老挝解放区，明目张胆地恫吓要派遣军队侵占中、下寮。美国和它的仆从还不断地侵犯和威胁柬埔寨领土，放肆地授权美国军队可以随时侵犯柬埔寨领土。它并且加紧在泰国建立军事基地，驱使泰国走狗参加它在印度支那地区的战争。
    显然，美帝国主义正在继续沿着加强侵越战争的极其危险的新的军事冒险道路滑下去，威胁着印度支那、东南亚和世界的和平。就在美国当局侈谈“和平”的时候，也就是它竭尽全力加紧进行扩大侵略战争活动的时候。就在它喧嚣地兜售骗人的“和平努力”的日子里，它比任何时候都更加紧进行侵略战争。
    越南民族的千年建国历史清楚地证明：每当祖国遭到外国侵略的时候，面对着侵略的敌人，全体越南民族就一致奋起拿起武器反抗敌人，最后取得光辉胜利。越南南方人民今天的抗美救国斗争，是由各阶层广大人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的正确领导下进行的民族解放斗争。全体越南南方人民不分民族、宗教、政党和政治倾向，团结在越南南方民族解放阵线周围，站起来坚决反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义侵略者。那里有压迫，那里就有斗争。美帝国主义在越南南方进行侵略战争，就必然遭到具有坚强不屈地反抗外国侵略的斗争传统的、并同全国同胞一起战斗和战胜法国殖民主义的南方人民拿起武器反对它。
    很明显，目前在越南南方的残酷战争的深远根源和直接原因来自美帝国主义的侵略政策。所有一切所谓越南人“侵略越南”、“北方侵略南方”等颠倒黑白的论调，都是无耻的诬蔑，是欺骗不了任何人的。
    越南南方人民团结一致，万众一心的神圣救国抗战事业是正义的，并且具有十分重要的国际意义，所以它赢得了世界上许多国家在道义和物质上的支援，当然也得到一千七百万北方骨肉同胞的全力支援。
    十多年来，越南南方人民从来不怕牺牲，不怕艰苦，坚决进行救国斗争，以实现本民族的最起码的和十分神圣的愿望，这就是赶走外国侵略者，争取独立、民主、和平和中立，进而统一祖国。越南南方民族解放阵线的成立及其合情合理的纲领，正确和充分地体现了全体越南南方人民的这一正当的愿望，所以能够团结越南南方不同政治倾向的各阶层人民。越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民抗战救国事业的组织者和领导者，它正在为实现南方一千四百万同胞的民族基本权利和殷切愿望而奋斗，并且已经和正在各个战场上给美帝国主义侵略者以沉重打击。作为全民的争取民族独立的爱国抗战的领导者——越南南方民族解放阵线，是一千四百万越南南方人民的唯一真正代表。至于那些由美国按其需要而扶植起来或推翻的、唯命是从、甘心执行美帝国主义的一切侵略、加强和扩大战争政策主张的所谓“西贡政权”各个集团，如果没有美国的军队、武器和美元，是一天也支撑不下去的，他们除了代表卖国贼之外，不能代表任何人。
    现在，越南南方民族解放阵线实际上已控制了拥有一千多万人口的、占五分之四的越南南方土地。世界上的一切进步组织、国际会议和人民都承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民唯一的真正代表，代表着越南南方人民的神圣民族权利和愿望。没有越南南方民族解放阵线的决定性发言和地位的任何解决南方问题的方案，都是无效的。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团完全赞同越南民主共和国主席胡志明今年一月二十四日的信中阐明的越南北方同胞的非常明确和正确的立场。
    如果美帝国主义真的尊重日内瓦协议，它就必须把美国和它的仆从军队全部撤出越南南方。
    如果美帝国主义真的要和平，它就不能不承认正在进行反侵略战斗的越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民唯一的真正代表。
    如果美帝国主义真的尊重越南南方人民的民族自决权，它就不能不承认越南南方民族解放阵线为实现越南南方的独立、民主、和平、中立和进而统一祖国而斗争的纲领。这个纲领是一千四百万越南南方人民的正当愿望。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团庄严重申：越南南方人民始终如一的立场是，只要美帝国主义还不肯承认越南南方人民的民族独立、民主、和平、中立和进而统一祖国的权利，还不肯把美国和它的仆从军队和武器全部撤出越南南方、撤销它在越南南方的各个军事基地，让南方人民自己解决自己的内部事务，还不肯立即无条件和永远地停止对越南北方的轰炸，并承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民的唯一真正代表，那么，在越南南方民族解放阵线领导下的越南南方人民仍然要紧握手中枪，不管需要作出多大的牺牲和经受多大的艰苦，不管要战斗十年、二十年或者更长的时间，也要继续坚决地战斗下去，直到越南南方人民最神圣和最基本的愿望得到实现为止。越南南方人民必胜！美国侵略者和它的走狗必败！
