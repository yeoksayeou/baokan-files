　　Promoting Stable and High Agricultural Yields
　　Guangdong Vigorously Grasps Land Leveling and Canal System Renovation
    (Our Dispatch) Guangdong is vigorously grasping land leveling and canal system renovation, reducing the underground water level, and promoting stable and high agricultural yields in the winter water conservancy construction. The province plans to renovate 10 million mu of farmland drainage and irrigation canal systems, of which 5 million mu have already been completed.
    Since liberation, especially since 1958, Guangdong Province has made great achievements in water conservancy construction, building more than 90,000 water storage projects and 590,000 horsepower of mechanical and electrical drainage and irrigation equipment. The irrigation area has reached 34 million mu, of which more than 20 million mu are guaranteed irrigation. These projects have played an important role in resisting drought and flood disasters and ensuring agricultural harvests.
    The gradual development of agricultural production has placed higher demands on water conservancy: to transform low yields into high yields, and high yields into even higher yields, it is necessary not only to solve the problem of irrigation, but also to solve the problem of drainage; not only to control surface water, but also to control groundwater; not only to facilitate drainage and irrigation, but also to facilitate cultivation, mechanized farming, and transportation. Therefore, from the winter of 1964 to the spring of 1965, Guangdong Province first started a movement in the Pearl River Delta to vigorously renovate farmland drainage and irrigation canal systems, focusing on separating irrigation and drainage canals, eliminating serial irrigation and drainage, and lowering the groundwater level. Before the autumn harvest of 1965, the Foshan Special District alone had completed the renovation of canal systems covering an area of ​​more than 2.5 million mu. Last year, Guangdong Province reported a bumper harvest in agriculture, with particularly significant increases in areas where canal system renovation and groundwater level reduction had been carried out. The Xixiang Commune in Xinhui County renovated 1,274 mu of canal systems in Thirteen Qing Enclosure. The average yield per mu in the early rice crop in 1965 was 520 jin, an increase of 41 percent compared to the previous year.
    According to investigation and summary, land leveling, canal system renovation, and groundwater level reduction have a great effect: First, lowering the groundwater level can improve plant growth and root development. Second, it can discharge toxic substances, accelerate the process of washing away salt and alkali, eliminate rusty paddy fields, and improve acid and saline fields. Third, it can eliminate serial irrigation and drainage, providing a material basis for implementing scientific drainage and irrigation. Fourth, it can regulate water temperature, soil temperature, and the microclimate in the fields, reducing weeds, and reducing plant diseases and insect pests. Fifth, it can convert paddy fields into upland-paddy rotation. Sixth, it facilitates cultivation, mechanized farming, and transportation.
    At present, the water conservancy movement, centered on land leveling, comprehensive supporting facilities, canal system renovation, and improved drainage and irrigation, is still developing continuously throughout the province. The broad masses of cadres and commune members, carrying forward the spirit of Dazhai, are determined to complete the task of renovating 10 million mu of canal systems.

　　促进农业稳产高产
　　广东大抓平整土地整治渠系
    本报讯　广东各地，在冬修水利运动中，大抓平整土地、整治渠系，降低地下水位，促进农业稳产高产。全省计划整治农田排灌渠系一千万亩，已经完成五百万亩。
    解放后，特别是一九五八年以来，广东省水利建设取得了很大成就，建成蓄水工程九万多处，机电排灌设备五十九万马力，灌溉面积达到三千四百万亩，其中保证灌溉的为二千多万亩。这些工程，对于抗御旱涝灾害，保障农业丰收起了重要作用。
    农业生产的逐步发展，对水利提出了更高的要求：要变低产为高产，高产再高产，不但要解决灌的问题，还要解决排的问题；不仅要控制地上水，而且要控制地下水；既要便利排灌，还要便于耕作，便于机耕，便于交通。因此，从一九六四年冬一九六五年春以来，广东省首先在珠江三角洲，开始了大搞以灌排渠道分开，消灭串灌串排，降低地下水位为中心的整治农田排灌渠系运动。一九六五年秋收前，仅佛山专区，就完成了整治渠系面积二百五十多万亩。去年广东全省农业普告丰收，其中以进行了渠系整治、降低了地下水位的地区增产尤为显著。新会县西安公社十三顷围整治渠系面积一千二百七十四亩，一九六五年早造平均亩产五百二十斤，比前一年增产百分之四十一。
    根据调查总结，平整土地，整治渠系，降低地下水位，作用很大：一、降低了地下水位，可以改善植株生长，改善根群发育。二、可以排出有毒物质，加速洗盐洗酸过程，消灭锈水田，改良酸咸田。三、可以消灭串灌串排，为实行科学排灌提供了物质基础。四、可以调节水温、土温和田间小气候，减少杂草，减少病虫害。五、可以将水田改为水旱轮作。六、便利耕作，便利机耕，便利交通。
    目前，全省以平整土地，全面配套，整治渠系，提高排灌为中心的水利运动仍在持续发展，广大干部、社员发扬大寨精神，决心完成一千万亩渠系整治任务。
