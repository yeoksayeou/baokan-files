    Xinhua News Agency, February 19th. The Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries hosted a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the Vietnamese Song and Dance Troupe. At the banquet, Chinese and Vietnamese comrades-in-arms both quoted President Ho Chi Minh's poem: "Profound is the friendship between Vietnam and China, comrades plus brothers," warmly praising the deep, militant friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam.
    Lu Dingyi, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, attended tonight's banquet.
    As the head of the Vietnamese Song and Dance Troupe, Qu Huy Can, deputy heads Pham Dinh Luc, and Doan Kim Binh, and all the members of the troupe entered the banquet hall, responsible persons from various fields in our country and literary and art workers from the capital applauded warmly, expressing their cordial welcome to the Vietnamese artists. During the banquet, Chinese and Vietnamese comrades-in-arms repeatedly raised their glasses to congratulate the Vietnamese people on the great victories they have achieved in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and to wish the friendship and cultural cooperation between the peoples of China and Vietnam would develop day by day.
    Li Chang, Vice Chairman of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, spoke first at the banquet, expressing his cordial greetings to the friendly and artistic envoys of the heroic Vietnamese people.
    Li Chang said that under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the heroic Vietnamese people have achieved great victories in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, severely打击 [dǎjī – strike, hit] the U.S. imperialists, greatly supported the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, and set a brilliant example for the people of the world.
    Li Chang said that Chinese literary and art workers and the broad masses of the people have long yearned to see the heroic image of the Vietnamese people from the Vietnamese people's fighting music and dance art, and to learn the revolutionary spirit of the Vietnamese people. The visit and performance of the Song and Dance Troupe of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will surely give the people of our country a great encouragement.
    Speaking of the friendship between Vietnam and China, Li Chang said, President Ho Chi Minh said it well: "Profound is the friendship between Vietnam and China, comrades plus brothers." No matter what storms occur in the world, the Chinese people will not hesitate to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese brothers at any sacrifice. The militant friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam, built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is eternal and unbreakable.
    In his speech, Troupe Leader Qu Huy Can also quoted President Ho's poem "Profound is the friendship between Vietnam and China, comrades plus brothers," expressing the Vietnamese people's brotherly feelings towards the Chinese people.
    He said that the Vietnamese nation is undergoing a great test and is fighting a life-and-death battle with the head of imperialism - U.S. imperialism. As long as there is one American devil on Vietnamese soil, we will fight, and we will keep fighting until they are completely crushed.
    Troupe Leader Qu Huy Can said that on our fighting road, the 650 million Chinese people have always stood with us. This most intimate militant unity and friendship is one of the sources of our powerful strength.
    Troupe Leader Qu Huy Can also praised the Chinese cultural and artistic circles for giving comprehensive, timely and profound support to the Vietnamese people's struggle. He said, our hearts are with every part of China, with the hearts of 650 million Chinese brothers.
    Invited to attend the banquet were Hoang Bac, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, and Le Tung Son, Acting Head of the Permanent Delegation of the South Vietnam National Front for Liberation in China.

    中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理陆定一出席了今晚的宴会。
    当越南歌舞艺术团团长瞿辉瑾，副团长范庭六、团金平，以及全体团员走进宴会厅的时候，我国各方面的负责人和首都文艺工作者热烈鼓掌，向越南艺术家表示亲切的欢迎。席间，中越两国战友一再举杯，祝贺越南人民在抗美救国斗争中所取得的伟大胜利，祝愿中越两国人民的友谊和文化合作事业日益发展。
    对外文委副主任李昌在宴会上首先讲话，向英雄的越南人民的友谊使者和艺术使者，表示亲切的问候。
    李昌说，英雄的越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，在抗美救国斗争中取得了伟大的胜利，狠狠地打击了美帝国主义者，极大地支援了全世界人民的革命斗争，为全世界人民树立了光辉的榜样。
    李昌说，中国的文艺工作者和广大人民早就渴望从越南人民的战斗的音乐舞蹈艺术中，看到越南人民的英雄形象，学习越南人民的革命精神。越南民主共和国歌舞艺术团的这次访问演出将一定能给我国人民以巨大的鼓舞。
    谈到越中友谊时，李昌说，胡志明主席说得好：“越中情谊深，同志加兄弟”。不管世界上发生什么狂风巨浪，中国人民将不惜任何牺牲和越南兄弟并肩战斗。中越两国人民建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础之上的战斗友谊是永恒的，是牢不可破的。
