    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 31st - The Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China recently called on Party organizations at all levels and cadres in all walks of life to place the study of Chairman Mao's works at the top of all work, to carry out the activities of studying Chairman Mao's works more consciously, more deeply, and more effectively, and to promote the victorious advancement of the three great revolutionary movements.
    This call from the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China was put forward at the Hebei Provincial Conference of Activists in Studying Chairman Mao's Works, which closed in mid-January.
    The meeting believed that in order to push the movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new upsurge, the key lies in the revolutionization of leading cadres. In the new year, we must firmly grasp the study of leading cadres, take practical measures, leaders taking the lead, grasping leaders, grasping without letting go, and grasping to the end. The study of leading cadres must be inspected from top to bottom, and also supervised by the masses from bottom to top. We must study with the spirit of rectification, and be brave in exposing the contradictions in our own thinking and work. Carry out criticism and self-criticism. In all its work, Party committees at all levels must adhere to putting Mao Zedong Thought in command and strictly control the political prominence. When deploying work, inspecting work, and summarizing work, we must creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. The main indicator of whether the work of a unit is good or not, and whether the leadership level is high or low, is to see whether it has grasped Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, whether the leading cadres have adhered to the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works, whether the four firsts have been implemented in various tasks, and whether the revolutionization of the masses has been promoted and a revolutionary leadership team has been brought out.
    The meeting also emphasized the need to face the grassroots, firmly grasp the grassroots, and let Mao Zedong Thought take root in the grassroots, so as to create more Daqing and Dazhai-style advanced units and local Red Ninth Companies.
    During the meeting, Comrade Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech, and Comrade Zhang Chengxian, Secretary of the Secretariat, made a report.
    At the meeting, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China commended twenty-eight activists in studying Chairman Mao's works and seventeen advanced collectives.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 31st - Anhui Province regards the study of Chairman Mao's works as the current primary task. The Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued instructions on further organizing cadres and the masses to study Chairman Mao's works.
    Over the past year, Party committees at all levels above the county level in Anhui Province, led by the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee, have established and improved learning systems, and many leading cadres have taken the lead in learning. There have also been improvements in learning methods, no longer discussing books in isolation or delving into nouns and concepts, but rather learning with problems in mind and combining learning with application. At present, some units in various parts of the province have emerged that are relatively advanced in the creative study and application of Mao Zedong Thought.
    In light of the current learning situation in the province, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed: Studying Chairman Mao's works is the most fundamental ideological construction of our Party, a major issue related to the success or failure of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and a major issue related to opposing revisionism and preventing revisionism. If a person wants to be revolutionized, the leadership core wants to be revolutionized, a department or a task wants to be revolutionized, they must seriously study Chairman Mao's works. Only by truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Mao Zedong Thought in command in all work can we implement the Party's policies well, carry out the socialist revolution to the end, and do a good job in work and production. However, some cadres still do not pay enough attention to learning, do not grasp it tightly, the methods are inappropriate, and the effect is not significant. In order to effectively strengthen ideological leadership in learning, the following ideological awareness issues must be further resolved among all Party members and cadres: First, is it politics in command or business in command? Can we do a good job without learning? Second, is it learning for revolution and learning with the spirit of revolution, or is it learning for the sake of learning? Third, is it learning with problems in mind, creatively studying and applying, or is it mechanically memorizing books and learning without applying? Fourth, is it that there is really no time to learn, or is it that we have not broken away from the work style of bureaucracy and have no strong desire to learn? The Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out: Only by seriously resolving these issues can we further improve the learning consciousness of the broad masses of Party members and cadres and promote the movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

### 河北安徽省委紧抓党的最根本的思想建设  号召干部更自觉地把毛泽东思想学到手

    河北安徽省委紧抓党的最根本的思想建设
    号召干部更自觉地把毛泽东思想学到手
    新华社天津三十一日电　中共河北省委最近号召各级党组织和各行各业的干部，把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，把学习毛主席著作的活动开展得更加自觉、更加深入、更有成效，推动三大革命运动胜利前进。
    中共河北省委这一号召，是在一月中旬闭幕的河北省学习毛主席著作积极分子会议上提出的。
    会议认为，要把学习毛主席著作运动推向新的高潮，关键在于领导干部的革命化。在新的一年里，要狠抓领导干部的学习，采取切实的措施，头头抓，抓头头，抓住不放，一抓到底。对领导干部的学习，要有自上而下的检查，也要有自下而上的群众监督。必须以整风精神进行学习，勇于揭露自己思想上和工作中的矛盾。开展批评自我批评。各级党委在一切工作中，必须坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，把好突出政治这一关。在布置工作、检查工作、总结工作时，都要活学活用毛主席著作。衡量一个单位的工作好不好，领导水平是高是低，主要标志就是要看是否抓住了以毛泽东思想为统帅，领导干部是否坚持了活学活用毛主席著作，是否在各项工作中落实了四个第一，是否促进了群众的革命化和带出一个革命化的领导班子。
    会议还强调要面向基层，狠抓基层，让毛泽东思想在基层扎根，从而创造出更多的大庆、大寨式的先进单位和地方上的红九连。
    会议期间，中共河北省委第一书记林铁同志讲了话，书记处书记张承先同志作了报告。
    会上，中共河北省委表扬了二十八个学习毛主席著作的积极分子和十七个先进集体。
    新华社合肥三十一日电　安徽省把学习毛主席著作作为当前首要任务。中共安徽省委在不久前为此发出关于进一步组织干部群众学习毛主席著作的指示。
    一年来，安徽全省县以上各级党委在省委常委的带动下，都建立和健全了学习制度，许多领导干部都带头学习。在学习方法上也有改进，不再就书论书钻名词概念，而是带着问题学，学用结合。目前，全省各地出现了一些活学活用毛泽东思想比较先进的单位。
    中共安徽省委针对目前全省学习情况提出：学习毛主席著作，是我们党最根本的思想建设，是一个关系到社会主义革命和社会主义建设成败的大问题，是一个关系到反对修正主义防止修正主义的大问题，一个人要革命化，领导核心要革命化，一个部门、一项工作要革命化，都必须认真学习毛主席著作。只有把毛泽东思想真正学到手，在一切工作中实行毛泽东思想挂帅，才能把党的方针政策执行好，把社会主义革命进行到底，把工作和生产搞好。但是，还有些干部对学习重视不够，抓得不紧，方法不当，效果不大。为了切实加强学习的思想领导，必须在全体党员、干部中，进一步解决以下几个思想认识问题：一、是政治挂帅，还是业务挂帅，不学习能不能做好工作。二、是为革命而学，用革命的精神来学，还是为学习而学习。三、是带着问题学，活学活用，还是死啃书本，学而不用。四、是实在没有时间学，还是没有摆脱事务主义的作风，没有学习的强烈要求。中共安徽省委指出：只有认真解决了这些问题，才能进一步提高广大党员、干部的学习自觉性，把学习毛主席著作的运动推进到一个新的阶段。
