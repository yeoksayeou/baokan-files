    The glorious life of Comrade Jiao Yulu, "The Model of a County Party Secretary," is being widely spread on all fronts across the country. Learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, like him studying and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's works in a living way, like him serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly, like him being "utterly selfless and devoted to others," like him dedicating himself heart and soul to the revolution, has become the strong aspiration of the broad masses of cadres and people.
    In our country, we have soldiers like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande who are "neither afraid of hardship nor death" for the revolution, and we have mass leaders like Jiao Yulu who "exhausted himself to the last breath" for the people. They are outstanding representatives of the thousands upon thousands of heroic figures of the Mao Zedong era. Their revolutionary spirit and noble qualities inspire and encourage the people.
    The report on the LANKAO county cadres and masses cherishing the memory of Comrade Jiao Yulu published today further illustrates the deep class feelings and close flesh-and-blood ties Comrade Jiao Yulu had with the broad masses. It is precisely by relying on such comrades that our Party leads the broad masses of people in the great struggle to transform the old world and build a new world.
    Overcoming the three scourges of waterlogging, sandstorms, and alkali soil, and building LANKAO, is the urgent demand of the county's 360,000 people. The county Party committee, which directly commands this earth-shattering struggle, must not only represent the interests of the people, put forward correct calls, and mobilize the broad masses to take action; but also go deep among the masses, conduct investigations and research, and provide individual guidance. Jiao Yulu traveled throughout the county, understood the laws of occurrence and development of waterlogging, sandstorms, and alkali soil, and specifically guided the masses in their struggle against disaster, achieving the desired results.
    What force can be relied upon to enable LANKAO county to recover from the profound natural disasters? Only the hard work of the county's masses. This means that not only must there be a strong leadership core that grasps the correct direction, but also the strength of the masses must be closely relied upon, and the masses must be fully mobilized. It is clear that such a large-scale revolutionary struggle to transform the world, as in LANKAO, how can it succeed if only relying on the efforts of a few leaders? We Marxists have always believed that revolution is the business of the masses themselves, and only by relying on the masses to use their hands and feet can things be done well.
    The causes of wind, sand and alkali disasters in Lankao County are complicated. To overcome these disasters, not only must there be abundant revolutionary enthusiasm, but also a variety of methods. Where do the methods come from? We must never rely on the meditation of a few people, but must learn and acquire treasures from the masses. Comrade Jiao Yulu concentrated the wisdom of the masses, summarized and promoted many experiences of the masses in fighting disasters. Facts have shown that as long as one is good at "coming from the masses," leaders will become smarter, have more methods, and better lead the masses forward.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: In order to win the victory of the socialist revolution and construction, we must train a large number of cadres who are both morally sound and professionally competent. They must understand Marxism-Leninism, have political foresight, have the ability to work, be full of the spirit of sacrifice, be able to solve problems independently, not waver in the face of difficulties, and work wholeheartedly for the people, for the class, and for the Party. Comrade Jiao Yulu is such a good cadre. To learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu is to more consciously act in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings and strive to be a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong.

### 要有更多这样的好干部

    要有更多这样的好干部
    “县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄同志”光辉的一生，在全国各个战线上，广泛地传颂着。学习焦裕禄同志，象他那样活学活用毛泽东同志的著作，象他那样完全彻底地为人民，象他那样“毫不利己专门利人”，象他那样一心一意为革命，成为广大干部和人民群众的强烈愿望。
    在我们国家，有雷锋、王杰、麦贤得这样为革命“一不怕苦、二不怕死”的战士，有焦裕禄这样为人民“鞠躬尽瘁”的群众领袖。他们是毛泽东时代千千万万英雄人物的杰出代表，他们的革命精神和高贵品质，激励着人们，鼓舞着人们。
    今天发表的兰考县干部、群众怀念焦裕禄同志的报道，进一步说明了焦裕禄同志同广大群众有着多么深厚的阶级感情，有着多么密切的血肉联系。我们党正是依靠着这样的同志，领导广大人民，进行改造旧世界、建设新世界的伟大斗争。
    战胜水、沙、碱三害，建设兰考，是全县三十六万人的迫切要求。直接指挥这场改天换地斗争的县委，不仅要代表人民的利益，提出正确的号召，动员广大群众行动起来；而且要深入群众，调查研究，进行个别的指导。焦裕禄跑遍全县，摸清水、沙、碱发生发展的规律，具体指导群众的抗灾斗争，取得预期的效果。
    依靠什么力量使兰考县从深重的自然灾难中翻过身来？只能依靠全县群众的艰苦奋斗。这就是说，不仅要有一个坚强的领导核心，掌握正确的方向，而且要紧紧依靠群众的力量，把群众充分发动起来。很清楚，象兰考这样大规模的改天换地的革命斗争，只靠少数领导人的努力，怎么能够成功呢？我们马克思主义者从来认为，革命是群众自己的事情，只有依靠群众动手动脚，事情才能办好。
    兰考县风沙水碱灾害的成因是复杂的。战胜这些灾害，不仅要有充沛的革命干劲，而且要有多种多样的办法。办法从那里来？绝不能依靠少数人的冥思苦想，而要到群众当中取经取宝。焦裕禄同志集中群众的智慧，总结、推广了群众创造的许多抗灾斗争经验。事实表明，只要善于“从群众中来”，领导人就会更加聪明，更有办法，更好地领导群众前进。
    毛泽东同志教导我们：为了取得社会主义革命和建设的胜利，必须造就大量德才兼备的干部。他们要懂得马克思列宁主义，有政治远见，有工作能力，富于牺牲精神，能独立解决问题，在困难中不动摇，忠心耿耿地为人民、为阶级、为党而工作。焦裕禄同志正是这样的好干部。学习焦裕禄同志，就要更加自觉地按照毛泽东同志的教导办事，努力争取做毛泽东同志的好学生。
