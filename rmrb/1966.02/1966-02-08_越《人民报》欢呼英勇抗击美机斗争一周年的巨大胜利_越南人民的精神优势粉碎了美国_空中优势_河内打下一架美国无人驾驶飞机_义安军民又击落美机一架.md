    The Vietnamese 《People's Daily》 Hails the Great Victory of the First Anniversary of the Heroic Struggle Against American Aircraft
    The Spiritual Superiority of the Vietnamese People Shatters America's "Air Superiority"
    Hanoi Shoots Down an American Unmanned Aircraft; Nghệ An Army and People Shoot Down Another American Aircraft
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 7th. The Vietnamese 《People's Daily》 published an editorial on February 7th regarding the first anniversary of the heroic struggle of the army and people of North Vietnam against American air pirates, saying that the people of North and South Vietnam possess powerful strength to continue fighting until complete victory. We will only advance, not retreat; only win, not fail.
    The editorial said that U.S. imperialism propagates that neither side can achieve military victory in this war. We can affirm that on the military front and on the political front, we have already won great victories and U.S. imperialism has already suffered disastrous defeats. We will certainly achieve complete victory, and U.S. imperialism will certainly suffer a heavy defeat.
    The editorial said that in the year that the army and people of North Vietnam have resisted the American air pirates, they have achieved great victories, and their strength in all aspects has rapidly increased; while U.S. imperialism has suffered disastrous defeats, and its situation is becoming increasingly difficult and embarrassing.
    The editorial said that the army and people of North Vietnam have inflicted fierce blows on the U.S. Air Force, shooting down 870 modern American aircraft and damaging hundreds more, shattering the myth of the U.S. Air Force's so-called "absolute superiority."
    The editorial pointed out that U.S. imperialism has suffered defeat because it only possesses advantages in terms of steel. The Vietnamese people have achieved victory because they possess absolute advantages in the political and spiritual fields, possess a correct war line, and have increasingly rich combat experience. They have brought into play all their spiritual and material strength in the battle to resist America and save the nation. A high tide of resisting America and saving the nation is flourishing throughout Vietnam. The people of the whole country have risen up to fight. A densely layered network of firepower, including all kinds of weapons, has formed a dragnet to encircle and annihilate American aircraft and capture American pilots.
    The editorial said that in the just struggle of resisting America and saving the nation, the Vietnamese people have received the sympathy and support of the people of the world. A united front of world people supporting Vietnam against American aggression has been formed. The struggle wave of opposing America and supporting Vietnam continues to rise throughout the world.
    The editorial said that U.S. imperialism is in a very embarrassing situation, but it is still extremely stubborn. All the heads of the Pentagon and the White House recently rushed in droves to Honolulu to plan new adventurous schemes. However, no plan can save them from defeat.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 7th. It was announced here tonight that this afternoon, the United States dispatched an unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft that intruded into the airspace over the outskirts of Hanoi and was shot down on the spot by the army and people of Hanoi.
    This is the fourteenth American unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft shot down in North Vietnam.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 7th. It was announced here tonight that this afternoon, the army and people of Nghệ An Province in North Vietnam shot down an intruding American bandit aircraft and captured the American pilot alive.

    越《人民报》欢呼英勇抗击美机斗争一周年的巨大胜利
    越南人民的精神优势粉碎了美国“空中优势”
    河内打下一架美国无人驾驶飞机　义安军民又击落美机一架
    新华社河内七日电　越南《人民报》七日就越南北方军民英勇抗击美国空中强盗斗争一周年发表社论说，越南北方和南方的人民拥有强大的力量来继续进行战斗，直到取得完全胜利为止。我们只有前进，没有后退，只有胜利，没有失败。
    社论说，美帝国主义宣传什么在这场战争中任何一方也不能取得军事上的胜利。我们可以肯定地说，在军事战线上和在政治战线上，我们已经大胜，美帝国主义已经大败，我们必将取得完全的胜利，美帝国主义必将遭到惨重的失败。
    社论说，在越南北方军民抗击美国空军强盗的一年的战斗中，已取得了巨大的胜利，各方面的力量迅速地增强；而美帝国主义遭到了惨重的失败，它的处境日益困难和窘迫。
    社论说，越南北方军民给予了美国空军以猛烈的打击，击落美国现代化飞机八百七十架，击伤数百架，粉碎了美国空军所谓“绝对优势”的神话。
    社论指出，美帝国主义遭到失败，是因为它只拥有钢铁方面的优势。越南人民取得胜利，是因为拥有政治和精神方面的绝对优势，拥有正确的战争路线和日益丰富的战斗经验。他们在抗美救国的战斗中，发挥了自己所有的精神上和物质上的力量。一个抗美救国的高潮在越南全国各地蓬勃开展。全国人民都起来进行战斗。一个包括各种武器的密密层层的火力网形成了一个围歼美国飞机和捕捉美国飞行员的天罗地网。
    社论说，越南人民在抗美救国的正义战斗中，得到了全世界人民的同情和支持。一个世界人民支援越南反对美国侵略的统一战线已经形成。反对美国、支援越南的斗争浪潮正在世界各地继续高涨。
    社论说，美帝国主义的处境狼狈不堪，但仍然极端顽固。所有五角大楼和白宫的头目们最近匆匆忙忙成群结队地跑到檀香山，策划新的冒险计划。但是，没有任何计策能够挽救他们的失败。
    新华社河内七日电　据这里今晚公布：今天下午，美国派遣一架无人驾驶高空侦察机，侵入河内市郊上空，被河内市军民当场击落。
    这是在越南北方被击落的第十四架美国无人驾驶高空侦察机。
    新华社河内七日电　据这里今晚公布：越南北方义安省军民今天下午击落入侵的美国强盗飞机一架，活捉了美国飞行员。
