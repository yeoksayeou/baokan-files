    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 2nd – According to Pathet Lao Radio, the governor of Khammouane Province in Central Laos, Thanmatsin, recently delivered a speech, warmly responding to the January 17th statement of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, and called on the soldiers and civilians of the entire province to resolutely crush the US imperialist conspiracy to invade Central and Lower Laos together with the national patriotic armed forces.

    Thanmatsin said that in the past two to three months, the United States and its running dogs concentrated nearly ten battalions of troops in Thakhek, launching offensives against the Phahong and Phana areas. From January 8th to 13th, they sent five battalions of troops, under the cover of artillery and aircraft, to attack the Kodang area.

    During this period, all types of American jet aircraft taking off from South Vietnam, Thailand, and the Seventh Fleet bombed and strafed the liberated areas day and night, especially Highways 8 and 12 within Khammouane Province.

    He pointed out that under the heroic counterattack of the patriotic soldiers and civilians in Khammouane Province, the offensives of US imperialism and its running dogs suffered disastrous defeats. From November to December last year, the soldiers and civilians of Khammouane Province eliminated more than 300 enemies. In addition, in coordinated operations with the soldiers and civilians of Savannakhet Province, they killed 618 enemies and wounded 42.

    Thanmatsin pointed out that the above-mentioned aggressive actions of US imperialism are an attempt to save its increasingly disastrous defeat in South Vietnam, which seriously threatens the peace and security of Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    The Lower Laos Region People's Liberation Army Command issued a statement on January 26th, strongly condemning the US imperialist conspiracy to send US aggressor troops to directly occupy the Central and Lower Laos regions. The statement called on all units of the Lao People's Liberation Army, especially the People's Liberation Army in the Central and Lower Laos regions, to highly develop the revolutionary struggle tradition and tenacious fighting spirit of the nation, actively develop people's war, and crush the US aggression conspiracy.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 1st – According to Pathet Lao Radio on the 1st, officers and soldiers of the Lao People's Liberation Army stationed in Xieng Khouang Province held a rally on the 19th, warmly responding to the statement issued by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front on January 17th, and strongly protesting the US imperialist conspiracy to send troops to occupy Central and Lower Laos.

    They also condemned US imperialism for bombing and strafing the Lao liberated areas, demanding that the United States and its running dogs must immediately stop the above-mentioned war actions, and must withdraw all US troops, weapons, and military equipment from Laos.

    They unanimously expressed at the rally that they were determined to strengthen unity and crush the US imperialist dry season offensive conspiracy.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 2nd – According to Pathet Lao Radio on the 2nd, the soldiers and civilians of Khammouane Province, Laos, shot down three invading American bandit planes on February 1st.

    On February 1st, multiple US bandit planes indiscriminately bombed and strafed Highway 12 in the liberated area of Khammouane Province. In order to defend the liberated area and the lives and property of the people, the soldiers and civilians of Khammouane Province immediately launched a fierce counterattack against the invading US planes.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 1st – According to "Voice of Laos" radio, the spokesman of the Lao Patriotic Neutral Forces Command issued a statement on January 31st, strongly protesting the indiscriminate bombing of the liberated area of Xieng Khouang Province, Laos, by American planes. The statement pointed out that the crimes of American planes increasingly intensifying the bombing and strafing of the Lao liberated areas have more clearly exposed the false peace face of US imperialism in front of the people of the world, revealing that it is further strengthening and expanding the war of aggression against Indochina.
