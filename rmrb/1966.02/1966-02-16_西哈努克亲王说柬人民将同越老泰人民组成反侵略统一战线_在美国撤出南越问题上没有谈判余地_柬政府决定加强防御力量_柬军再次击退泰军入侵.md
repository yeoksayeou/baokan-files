    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 14th, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk stated in a speech to the Cambodian Parliament on February 14th that the only correct stance on the Vietnam issue "is to demand that the United States remove all its bases in South Vietnam, withdraw all its troops and non-Vietnamese troops from its allies and satellite countries, and immediately cease its bombing of North Vietnam. There can be no conditions attached to these issues, and there is no room for negotiation." He said that in the event of aggression against Cambodia, Cambodia would not hesitate to stand with the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand to form a united front against aggression.

    Prince Sihanouk pointed out: "It is absolutely impermissible for the United States or any other country to remain in South Vietnam. To talk about negotiating with the United States is an intolerable contempt for international law and the 1954 Geneva Accords. I would even say that it is a grave insult to all the signatories of the aforementioned agreements."

    Speaking of the U.S. "peace talks" deception on the Vietnam issue, Prince Sihanouk said: "Many people and many governments in the world have been deceived by the vast propaganda machine of wealthy imperialism and its intentional or unintentional accomplices, deceived by Johnson. In fact, the suggestions of 'non-aligned countries' and other governments to 'mediate' between the belligerents are intended to make people believe that it is the North Vietnamese, who are bombed every day, and the South Vietnamese, who are suffering bloodshed and sacrifice, who are refusing peace, even refusing independence, or that they are willing slaves who are dying according to the orders of the People's Republic of China." He said: I firmly believe that history will pass a very harsh judgment on all these governments and religious authorities, because these governments and religious authorities unthinkingly insist on helping the sinful American aggressors to arrogantly take away the rights that belong to Vietnam and the Vietnamese people, rights that the 1954 Geneva Accords never stipulated giving to them.

    Prince Sihanouk condemned the increasingly frequent invasions and provocations against Cambodia by Thailand and Saigon, the lackeys of U.S. imperialism. He said: "All Khmers, that is, our people, our army, our youth, our clergy, are constantly harassed by the Thais and their 'Free Khmer' mercenaries. They will not allow others to kill our border residents almost every day, bombard our outposts, and lay mines on our paths and highways."

    Sihanouk said: "We will now and in the future unhesitatingly retaliate against the aggressors, answering their aggression against our territory by infringing on their territory. If aggressors shell one of our outposts or villages, we will shell one of their outposts or villages. If they force war upon us, we will never evade it." He said, "Our monks can hardly bear it. Many have come to ask the Head of State to allow them to go to the battlefield when we one day wage a war against our enemies, even if it is to fight with wooden sticks. Therefore, we want to tell the whole world in advance, especially our enemies, the imperialists and their lackeys, that we will not hesitate to stand with the people of fraternal Vietnam (Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front), Laos (Lao Patriotic Front), and Thailand (Patriotic Front) to form a united front against the aggressors.

    "Of course, we fully know that our opponents have a material advantage, but the fraternal Vietnamese people, despite their suffering, still refuse to make any compromise with the American aggressors. We will also, in the same spirit, fight the common enemy like the fraternal Vietnamese people."

    "Therefore, we solemnly ask our enemies to end their dangerous gamble. If they refuse, we have the right to launch a fierce ground counterattack, regardless of the possible consequences. The whole world can attest that we are not now and never will be the source of the conflict. American imperialists and their Bangkok and Saigon lackeys, as well as the 'Free Khmer' bandits, can only be held responsible for this conflict."

    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 14th, Cambodia News Agency reported on February 14th that Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk presided over an important working conference on Cambodian border defense issues on the 13th. Measures were taken in military, administrative, economic, and social aspects to strengthen Cambodia's border defenses in order to deal with the almost daily acts of aggression from Cambodia's neighboring countries and their lackeys—traitorous "Free Khmer" elements.

    Cambodia News Agency also reported that the Royal Government of Cambodia, with the approval of the Head of State, decided to increase the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces by 1,500 personnel.

    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 15th, Cambodia News Agency reported that two companies of Thai armed forces invaded Cambodian territory in several directions on the 13th, attacking Chi Ne Sa and Chang Yang in Koh Kong province.

    These invaders were covered by the firepower of two Thai warships that intruded into Cambodian territorial waters and heavy weapons from the Thai Ha Le outpost.

    Cambodian border guards launched a fierce counterattack against the invaders. After two and a half hours of fighting, they forced the enemy to retreat into Thai territory.

    One Thai warship was hit by the Cambodian border guards' artillery fire and hurriedly fled into Thai territorial waters, sinking near Ha Le.

    西哈努克亲王说柬人民将同越老泰人民组成反侵略统一战线
    在美国撤出南越问题上没有谈判余地
    柬政府决定加强防御力量　柬军再次击退泰军入侵
    据新华社金边十四日电　柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王十四日在柬埔寨议会上发表讲话说，在越南问题上唯一的正确立场，“就是要求美国撤除它在南越的一切基地，撤走它的一切军队和它的盟国和卫星国的非越南人军队，立即停止它对北越的轰炸。在这些问题上既不能附有任何条件，也没有谈判的余地。”他说，在柬埔寨遭受侵略的情况下，柬埔寨将毫不犹豫地同越南、老挝、泰国人民站在一起，组成一条反侵略的统一战线。
    西哈努克亲王指出：“绝对不许美国和其他任何国家赖在南越，谈论要同美国进行谈判，就是对国际法和一九五四年日内瓦协议的不可容忍的蔑视。我还要说一句，这甚至是对上述协议的所有签字国的严重侮辱。”
    在谈到美国在越南问题上的“和谈”骗局时，西哈努克亲王说：“世界上许多人和许多政府受了有钱的帝国主义及其有意或无意的同谋者的庞大宣传机器的骗，受了约翰逊的骗。事实上，‘不结盟国家’和其他国家政府向交战国作出‘斡旋’的建议，目的在于使人相信，是天天遭到轰炸的北越人和遭到流血牺牲的南越人拒绝和平，甚至拒绝独立，要不就是他们甘愿按照中华人民共和国的命令去送死的奴隶。”他说：我坚信，历史将对所有这些政府和宗教当局作出十分严厉的审判，因为这些政府和宗教当局甚至不加思索地坚持帮助罪恶的美国侵略者，让他们蛮横地取得越南和越南人民拥有的权利，而一九五四年日内瓦协议从来没有规定把这种权利给予他们。
    西哈努克亲王谴责了美帝国主义的走狗泰国和西贡对柬埔寨进行日益频繁的入侵和挑衅。他说：“全体高棉人，也就是我国人民、我国军队、我国青年、我国神职人员，遭到泰国人及其‘自由高棉’雇佣军的不断骚扰。他们不会听任别人几乎每天杀害我国的边境居民、炮轰我们的哨所和在我国的小路、公路上埋设地雷。”
    西哈努克说：“我们现在和将来都会毫不犹豫地对侵略者以牙还牙，用侵犯他们领土的办法来回答他们对我国领土的侵犯，侵略者炮击我们的一个哨所或村庄，我们就炮击他们的一个哨所或村庄。如果他们把战争强加在我们头上，我们决不回避。”他说，“我们的僧侣们难以忍耐了。许多人来要求国家元首准许他们在有朝一日我们将进行一场反对我们敌人的战争时能奔赴战场，那怕是用木棒进行战斗也罢。因此，我们要预先告诉全世界，特别是要告诉我们的敌人帝国主义者及其走狗，我们将毫不犹豫地同兄弟的越南（越南民主共和国和民族解放阵线）、老挝（老挝爱国战线党）和泰国（爱国阵线）的人民站在一起，组成一条反对侵略者的统一战线。
    “当然，我们完全知道，我们的对手拥有物资方面的优势，但是兄弟的越南人民尽管遭受着苦难，仍然拒绝同美国侵略者作任何妥协。我们也将本着同样的精神，象兄弟的越南人民一样，对共同的敌人进行斗争。”
      “因此，我们庄严地要求我们的敌人结束他们危险的赌注。如果他们拒绝，我们有权力展开猛烈的地面反击，而不管后果可能是什么。全世界都证明，我们现在不是而且永远也不是冲突的根源，美帝国主义者及其曼谷、西贡走狗以及‘自由高棉’匪徒只能对这场冲突负责”。
    新华社金边十四日电　据柬埔寨新闻社十四日报道，柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王在十三日主持了一次关于柬埔寨边防问题的重要工作会议。在军事、行政、经济和社会等方面都采取了措施，以便加强柬埔寨边境的防御力量，对付几乎每天发生的来自柬埔寨的邻国和他们的走狗——叛徒“自由高棉”分子的侵略行动。
    柬埔寨新闻社还报道说，柬埔寨王国政府经国家元首批准，决定把柬埔寨王家武装部队增加一千五百人。
    新华社金边十五日电　据柬埔寨新闻社报道，泰国武装部队两个连十三日分几路侵入柬埔寨领土，袭击了戈公省的奇内萨和昌扬。
    这些入侵者得到窜入柬埔寨领水的两艘泰国军舰和泰国哈勒哨所的重武器火力的掩护。
    柬埔寨边防军向入侵者进行了猛烈的还击，经过两个半小时的战斗，迫使敌人退回泰国境内。
    一艘泰国军舰被柬埔寨边防军的炮火击中后，急忙逃入泰国领水，在哈勒附近沉没。
