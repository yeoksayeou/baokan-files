    A United Press International dispatch from Vientiane on the 21st reported that officials of the Vientiane puppet regime were complaining that the United States did not pay “enough attention” to Laos, and American diplomats also admitted this.
    For more than ten years, the United States has never ceased its aggression against Laos, and has invested a large amount of money in it. How can it be said that it is “not paying enough attention”? Why did American diplomats actually agree with this complaint?
    This charade foreshadows that the United States will pay even more "attention" to Laos, that is to say, it will further intensify and expand its aggression against Laos.

    意在言外
    美联社二十一日从万象发出一则报道说，万象伪政权的官员们埋怨美国对老挝“注意不够”，美国外交家也承认这一点。
    十多年来，美国一直没有停止过对老挝的侵略，并且为此投下了大量的赌本。怎么能说是“注意不够”呢？为什么美国外交官居然还同意这种埋怨呢？
    这样一出双簧预示着，美国要对老挝更加“注意”了，也就是说它要进一步加紧扩大对老挝的侵略。
