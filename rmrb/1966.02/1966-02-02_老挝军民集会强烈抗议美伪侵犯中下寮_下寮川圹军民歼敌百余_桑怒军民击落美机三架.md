    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 29th -- According to a Pathet Lao Radio broadcast on the 29th: Patriotic military personnel and civilians in the Muang Phine liberated area of Savannakhet Province, Laos, held a rally on the 23rd to strongly protest the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs' conspiracy to occupy the central and lower regions of Laos, as well as their intensified use of aircraft to bomb and spread chemical poisons to kill the people of the liberated areas.
    The governor of Savannakhet Province, at the rally in the Muang Phine liberated area, pointed out that these crimes of the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs are part of a new U.S. military adventure conspiracy against Laos and an extremely serious new step by the U.S. to expand its war of aggression throughout Indochina.
    On behalf of all the people of Savannakhet Province, he warmly supported the statement issued by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front on the 17th and strongly demanded that the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs must immediately cease their criminal actions and withdraw all U.S. aggressive military personnel, weapons, and war materiel from Laos.
    According to another Pathet Lao Radio broadcast: Youths in Savannakhet Province are clamoring to join the Lao People's Liberation Army and directly participate in the struggle against the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs. In Muang Phine and Sepon alone, a group of youths recently joined the main force of the People's Liberation Army, and many other youths have joined the militia and guerrilla forces.
    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 28th -- According to Pathet Lao Radio: In two days, the 12th and 14th, patriotic military personnel and civilians in Xieng Khouang Province, Laos, wiped out 56 enemies. Patriotic military personnel and civilians in Sam Neua Province shot down three U.S. aircraft in two days, the 5th and 13th.
    The radio station said that at the beginning of January, the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs dispatched a batch of troops, including Thai troops, to carry out harassment in the southwest of the Plain of Jars. On the 12th, local patriotic military personnel and civilians killed 15 enemies and wounded many others in Ban Pha. On the 14th, they killed another 41 enemies and seized many weapons and military supplies in the Ban Bou area.
    Recently, the U.S. imperialists have continuously dispatched aircraft to carry out frantic bombing and strafing of various parts of Sam Neua Province, especially along Highway 6. Local patriotic military personnel and civilians heroically fought back against the invading aerial bandits, shooting down two U.S. jet aircraft on the 5th and another one on the 13th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 1st -- According to Pathet Lao Radio: On January 16th, patriotic military personnel and civilians in the Thaton area of Saravane Province, Lower Laos, heroically counterattacked the "sweeping" operations of the United States and its running dogs, killing more than 40 enemies and wounding many others.
    On January 16th, the United States and its running dogs dispatched four battalions of troops to launch a frantic "sweeping" operation in the Thaton area of Saravane Province. Wherever they went, they barbarously plundered, destroyed, and raped women.
    In order to defend the lives and property of the people in the liberated areas, the local patriotic armed forces, in close coordination with the people, fought heroically, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy with fierce firepower.

    沙湾拿吉省省长在芒芳解放区的集会上指出，美帝国主义和它的走狗的这些罪行是美国对老挝的新的军事冒险阴谋的一部分，也是美国把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那的极其严重的新步骤。
    他代表沙湾拿吉省全体人民热烈支持老挝爱国战线党中央委员会十七日的声明，强烈要求美帝国主义和它的走狗必须立即停止罪恶的行动，把美国的侵略军事人员、武器和战争工具全部撤出老挝。
    另据巴特寮电台广播：沙湾拿吉省青年纷纷要求参加老挝人民解放军，直接参加抗击美帝国主义和它的走狗的斗争。仅芒芳和车邦两地，不久前就有一批青年参加人民解放军的主力部队，还有许多青年参加了民兵游击队。
    新华社康开二十八日电据巴特寮电台广播：老挝川圹省爱国军民在十二日和十四日两天消灭敌人五十六名。桑怒省爱国军民在五日和十三日两天打落三架美国飞机。
    电台说，一月初，美帝国主义和它的走狗派遣一批军队，其中包括泰国军队，到查尔平原西南部进行骚扰，当地爱国军民十二日在班帕打死敌人十五名，打伤多名，十四日又在班布地区打死敌人四十一名、缴获许多武器和军用物资。
    最近，美帝国主义接连派遣飞机对桑怒省各地，特别是沿第六号公路一带进行疯狂轰炸和扫射。当地爱国军民对来犯的空中强盗英勇还击，五日打落两架美国喷气式飞机，十三日又打落一架。
    新华社康开一日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝下寮沙拉湾省塔顿地区的爱国军民一月十六日对美国及其走狗军队的“扫荡”进行英勇的反击，打死敌人四十多名，打伤多名。
    一月十六日，美国及其走狗军队出动了四个营的兵力，向沙拉湾省塔顿地区发动疯狂的“扫荡”。它们每到一地，就野蛮地大肆掠夺、破坏和强奸妇女。
    为了保卫解放区人民的生命和财产，当地爱国武装在人民的紧密配合下，英勇战斗，以猛烈的火力给敌人以重大杀伤。
