    The Most Optimistic and Strongest Person
    ——Five Praises for Jiao Yulu
    Yu Jun
    During the few days of my visit to Lankao, I was deeply moved by Comrade Jiao Yulu's strong and optimistic revolutionary spirit. Comrades from the county committee told me that Comrade Jiao Yulu's liver disease was already very serious in his later period in Lankao, but he still insisted on working without showing any signs of it. He loved to play checkers, and even when his liver hurt badly, he would often pull comrades to play chess, pressing the corner of the table against the painful area while frequently bursting into laughter. He was such an optimistic person!
    The severe pain in the late stages of liver cancer with subcutaneous metastasis is indescribable. However, Comrade Jiao Yulu never shouted or groaned while in the hospital. This tenacious willpower surprised the doctors and nurses, who tearfully asked him, "Comrade Jiao Yulu, if it hurts too much, just shout a few times!" But they never heard Comrade Jiao Yulu shout. On the contrary, sometimes they saw Comrade Jiao Yulu reading "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in the ward!
    The most valuable aspect of Comrade Jiao Yulu's strong and optimistic revolutionary spirit lies not only in his great endurance in fighting illness, but also in his unwavering confidence in leading the masses to fight against nature, the land, and people, no matter how great the difficulties or how severe the natural disasters. Some comrades in the county committee frankly told me that they originally lacked confidence in changing Lankao's natural appearance. However, as soon as Comrade Jiao Yulu arrived in Lankao, he inspired and infected them with his far-sighted optimism. Were the disasters severe? Yes. Were the difficulties great? Yes. But difficulties can be overcome, and ahead lies brightness, hope, and victory! Others, when seeing natural disasters, always felt helpless, but Comrade Jiao Yulu was not like that. When he saw the large pools of water, he said, "Great! Fish can be raised in the deep water in the middle, and reeds can be planted in the shallow water around. This is simply a treasure trove!" When he saw the large sand dunes, he said, "Plant trees to lock the sand, and it will become an oasis in the future. Wouldn't those all become money trees?" "Our comrades, in times of difficulty, must see the achievements, see the light, and increase our courage." Comrade Jiao Yulu fully embodied Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings in practice. In his dictionary, there were no words like "despondency."
    Why was Comrade Jiao Yulu so strong and optimistic? Because he had Mao Zedong Thought. According to his comrades-in-arms, he studied "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" when going to the countryside, studied "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" before meetings, and when returning from the countryside at night, despite being very tired and in liver pain, he would still study "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" while nibbling on cold steamed buns. He usually kept "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" by his pillow, and after his death, he had two books under his pillow: one was "On Communist Party Members' Self-Cultivation," and the other was still "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"! He was a person who studied "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" eagerly, and Mao Zedong Thought truly armed his mind. A person with Mao Zedong Thought can have a broad vision, grasp the laws of development of things, rely on the masses, and firmly believe in the future. Therefore, no difficulty could stop him, no physical pain could scare him, and he was always so optimistic, open-minded, strong, fearless, and magnanimous. A person with Mao Zedong Thought is the most optimistic and strongest person!

    最乐观最坚强的人
    ——五赞焦裕禄
    郁军
    在兰考访问的几天里，焦裕禄同志那种坚强而又乐观的革命精神，深深地感动着我。县委会的同志告诉我，焦裕禄同志在兰考的后期，肝病已经很严重，但他仍是不露神色地坚持着工作。他爱下跳棋，肝疼得厉害，还经常拉着同志们下棋，一面弯着腰用桌角顶住肝痛的地方，一面又经常放声大笑。他就是这么一个乐观的人！
    肝癌后期、皮下扩散，肉体上的剧痛，是无法形容的。可是焦裕禄同志住在医院里，从不喊叫、呻吟。这种顽强的意志力，使医生、护士们感到吃惊，他们曾含着泪花要求他：“焦裕禄同志，痛得厉害，你就喊它几声吧！”但是，他们还是没有听到过焦裕禄同志的喊声，相反，有时看到的，却是焦裕禄同志在病室中读《毛泽东选集》！
    焦裕禄同志这种坚强而又乐观的革命精神的最可贵之处，还不在他和疾病斗争的巨大忍耐力中，而在他不管面临多么大的困难、多么严重的自然灾害，总是满怀信心，看到光明，率领着群众，与天与地与人斗。县委会有的同志，很坦率地对我说，他们原来对于改变兰考自然面貌，是缺乏信心的。但是，焦裕禄同志一到兰考，就以那高瞻远瞩的乐观主义精神鼓舞了他们、感染了他们。灾害吗？是严重的；困难吗？是巨大的。但是，困难是可以战而胜之的，前面是光明、希望和胜利啊！别人看到自然界的一些灾害，总觉得没法对付，可是焦裕禄同志就不是这样。他看到大潭坑，就说：“好啊！中间水深的地方养上鱼，周围水浅的地方栽上蒲苇。这简直是个聚宝盆啊！”看到大沙丘，他就说：“种上树，锁住沙，将来变成一片绿洲，那上面不都成了摇钱树了吗？”“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”焦裕禄同志在实践中，完全体现了毛泽东同志的这个教导。在他的字典里，是没有“垂头丧气”这四个字眼的。
    为什么焦裕禄同志能这么坚强、乐观？因为他有毛泽东思想。据他的战友们回忆，他下乡学《毛泽东选集》，开会前学《毛泽东选集》，夜晚下乡回来，尽管很疲乏、肝痛，他一边啃着凉馍，一边还是学《毛泽东选集》。他平时枕边放着《毛泽东选集》，死后枕下两本书，一本是《论共产党员的修养》，另外一本还是《毛泽东选集》！他是一个如饥似渴地学习着《毛泽东选集》的人，毛泽东思想真正武装了他的头脑。有了毛泽东思想的人，就能高瞻远瞩，掌握事物发展的规律，依靠群众，坚信未来。因此，什么困难也阻挡不了他，什么肉体上的痛苦也吓不倒他，而总是那么乐观豁达、那么坚强无畏、那么心胸坦荡。有了毛泽东思想的人，是最乐观最坚强的人！
