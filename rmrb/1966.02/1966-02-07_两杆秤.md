    In the past, our team didn't have steelyards. It was impossible to weigh large items, and small items could only be estimated. The most difficult person was the cook. Every time they cooked, they had to use a small bowl that had been pre-marked, adding rice to the pot bowl by bowl. It was extremely awkward.
    Zhao Wenliang, the deputy drilling foreman of the First Platoon, and Li Zhenwen, the driver, went home to visit their families. They secretly discussed finding a way to buy two steelyards to bring back. The result of their discussion was that Zhao Wenliang would buy a large steelyard, and Li Zhenwen would buy a small one. In this way, when they returned to the team, a small steelyard that could weigh twenty jin and a large steelyard that could weigh two hundred jin came with them. The comrades were overjoyed, especially the cook班长 Du Haijiang, who was so happy he couldn't close his mouth. He kept saying, "This is great, this is great, our little bowl is liberated!" This caused a burst of laughter among everyone.

    两杆秤
    以前，我们队里没有杆秤，大东西没法称，小东西只能估个数。困难最大的要算是炊事员了，每次做饭都要用一只预先做好记号的小碗，一碗一碗地往锅里下米，真别扭极了。
    一班副司钻赵文良和司机李振文探亲回家，他俩暗暗商量，一定要设法买两杆秤回来。商量的结果，赵文良买杆大的，李振文买杆小的。就这样，他俩归队时，一杆能称二十斤的小秤和一杆能称二百斤的大秤，也跟着他们来了队上。同志们可乐啦，特别是炊事班长杜海江可高兴得合不上嘴巴啦。他连连说，“这下可好啦，这下可好啦，我们那小碗也该解放啦。”引得大伙一阵哄笑。
