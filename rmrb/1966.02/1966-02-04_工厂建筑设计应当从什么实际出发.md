    In designing a factory, the Central South Industrial Architecture Design Institute had a debate with the construction unit about "big reality" and "small reality." They studied and applied Mao Zedong's works in a living way, realizing that they should first start from the "big reality" of 600 million people. As a result, the factory construction did not occupy farmland and saved investment, achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 3rd. Recently, the Central South Industrial Architecture Design Institute designed a grain machinery factory for Anlu County, Hubei Province. During the design process, the design department had a debate with the construction unit about "big reality" and "small reality." The result of this debate clarified the true meaning of starting from reality in capital construction, thereby building a factory more, faster, better, and more economically.
    The debate first began on the issue of selecting a factory site. Initially, the construction unit selected a site near the meteorological observatory, and the designers favored another site within the ruins of an old yamen in Chengguan. The construction unit believed that the ruins were bordered by a river on two sides and close to urban residents on the other two sides, making the area small and inconvenient for factory production and development. However, the designers believed that the site chosen by the construction unit would require relocating the meteorological observatory and occupying hundreds of mu of farmland, which was detrimental to agricultural production. Both sides argued back and forth, each claiming that construction should start from reality, each holding their own views and refusing to give way. As for what kind of reality the factory construction should start from, and what the true meaning of "starting from reality" was, neither side could articulate it clearly.
    The designers decided to find answers in Chairman Mao's works with this question. They carefully understood Chairman Mao's teaching: "When we make plans, handle affairs, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that our country has 600 million people, and we must never forget this point," and their minds suddenly opened up. They realized that starting from reality should first take the "big reality" of 600 million people as a prerequisite, and then consider the "small reality" of factory production and life. The "small reality" must obey the "big reality." Building a factory in the countryside should first start from the reality of the countryside, trying as much as possible not to occupy or occupy less farmland, and not to demolish or demolish fewer houses. They repeatedly discussed their opinions with the construction unit, and finally decided to build the factory on the ruins.
    At the same time, in order to meet the factory's reasonable requirements for land area, after discussion between the two parties, the employee dormitories were arranged in the open spaces between urban residents' houses, thereby expanding the factory area and facilitating factory production and development. It also made full use of the existing public welfare facilities in the town, greatly reducing the public building projects in the living area.
    The second round of the debate focused on the specific design process of the factory buildings. With the expansion of the factory area, some people in the construction unit proposed that since it was a ruin, the land area should be appropriately expanded, advocating for large-scale leveling and excavation. However, the designers considered that large-scale leveling and excavation would involve a large amount of work and increase investment; excessive expansion of the land area would also hinder the future development of the factory. They said that building a factory should start from the "big reality" of 600 million people, not only to benefit agricultural production but also to resolutely implement the construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Under the guidance of this thinking, they arranged the factory buildings into a stepped vertical design according to the transportation characteristics in the factory's production process, adapting to local conditions. Under the natural terrain conditions with a maximum height difference of ten meters, they limited the amount of earth filling and excavation to within 23,000 cubic meters and the factory area to within 42,000 square meters, thereby saving a lot of development costs, shortening the construction period, and leaving the factory with more than 17,000 square meters of development space.
    After several debates and several practices, the understanding between each other has greatly improved, and examples of "small reality" obeying "big reality" have become increasingly common. There were more than 3,000 square meters of old buildings on the ruins. Both sides unanimously agreed to preserve them, slightly renovate them, and convert them into the factory's warehouses, garages, and offices, which saved a large amount of construction funds.
    However, can a factory be built well with just the word "save"? Initially, the designers did not consider this issue well. When designing the skylight of the metal processing workshop, they designed it as a window that could only let light in from one side. The construction unit pointed out that this was the main factory building and production could not be affected for the sake of unilateral savings. The designers recalculated, and it was indeed the case, so they changed it to a double-sided lighting skylight. This incident made the designers deeply feel that unilaterally emphasizing the interests of the "big reality" without seriously solving the reasonable requirements of the "small reality" would also harm the interests of the "big reality."
    Currently, this factory is about to be completed. Due to the reasonable resolution of the relationship between "big reality" and "small reality" during construction, the project quality, the factory's production and living conditions, and the factory's future development needs have been guaranteed. It has also not occupied a single mu of farmland, has not demolished a single house, and has saved the country more than 400,000 yuan in capital construction investment.

### 工厂建筑设计应当从什么实际出发

    工厂建筑设计应当从什么实际出发
    中南工业建筑设计院在设计一座工厂时，同兴建单位发生一场“大实际”和“小实际”的争论。他们带着这个问题活学活用毛泽东著作，认识到首先应该从六亿人口这个“大实际”出发，结果，使工厂的建设不占用农田，节约了投资，做到了多快好省。
    新华社武汉三日电　最近，中南工业建筑设计院为湖北省安陆县设计了一座粮食机械厂。在设计过程中，设计部门同兴建单位发生了一场“大实际”和“小实际”的争论。这场争论的结果，使人们弄清了基本建设必须从实际出发的真实含义，从而多快好省地建设了一座工厂。
    争论首先是在选择厂址的问题上开始的。最初，兴建单位在气象台附近选择了一个厂址，设计人员在城关一个旧衙门废墟上看中了另一个厂址。兴建单位认为，废墟两面靠河，两面紧挨城镇居民，面积小，不便工厂的生产和发展，而设计人员认为兴建单位选择的厂址，要迁徙气象台，还要占用百亩农田，不利农业生产。双方争来争去，都说建设应该从实际出发，各执一端，互不相让。至于建设工厂究竟应当从什么实际出发？“从实际出发”的真实含义是什么？谁也说不透彻。
    设计人员决心带着这个问题从毛主席著作中找答案。他们细细领会了毛主席的教导：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点”，思想上豁然开朗。他们认识到：从实际出发，首先应该以六亿人民这个“大实际”为前提，然后再去考虑工厂生产、生活这个“小实际”。“小实际”必须服从“大实际”。在农村建设工厂，就应该首先从农村的实际出发，尽可能不占或少占农田，不拆或少拆民房。他们把自己的意见反复同兴建单位商量，最后决定利用废墟建厂。
    与此同时，为了满足工厂对用地面积的合理要求，双方商量之后，把职工宿舍布置在城镇居民住宅之间的空地上，从而扩大了厂区用地范围，便利了工厂的生产和发展，并且充分利用城镇现有的公共福利设施，大大减少了生活区的公用建筑项目。
    争论的第二个回合集中在厂房的具体设计过程中。厂区用地面积扩大了，兴建单位又有人提出，既是一块废墟，用地面积就应当放宽一些，主张大平大挖。但是设计人员考虑到，大平大挖，工作量很大，增加了投资；用地面积过分放宽，也会妨碍工厂今后的发展。他们说，建设工厂要从六亿人口的“大实际”出发，不仅要有利于农业生产，而且必须坚决贯彻多快好省的建设方针。在这个思想指导下，他们根据工厂生产过程中的运输特点，因地制宜地把厂房布置成阶梯形的竖向设计，在最大高差达十米的自然地形条件下，把填挖土方量限制在二万三千立方米以内，把厂区用地面积限制在四万二千多平方米以内，从而节约了大量的开拓费用，缩短了工期，还给工厂留下了一万七千多平方米的发展余地。
    几番争论，几番实践，彼此间的认识都提高了一大步，“小实际”服从“大实际”的事例越来越多。废墟上原有三千多平方米旧建筑，双方一致同意把它保存下来，稍加修葺，改作工厂的仓库、汽车库和办公室，又节省了一大笔建筑资金。
    但是，建设一个工厂，是不是一个“省”字就可以写好全篇文章；起初，设计人员没有很好考虑这个问题。他们在设计金属加工车间的天窗时，设计成了只能一面射进光线的窗子。兴建单位提出这是主要厂房，不能为了片面节约而影响生产。设计人员再次计算，果然不错，便把它改为双面采光天窗。这件事使设计人员深切地感到，片面强调“大实际”的利益，不认真解决“小实际”的合理要求，其结果也会损害“大实际”的利益。
    目前，这个工厂即将竣工。由于建设中合理解决了“大实际”和“小实际”的关系，既保证了工程质量、工厂的生产和生活条件以及工厂今后的发展需要，也没有占用一亩农田，没有拆毁一间民房，并且为国家节约基本建设投资四十多万元。
