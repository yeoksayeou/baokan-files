　　In response to the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, the President of the Republic of Ghana, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, will pay a friendly visit to our country today on his way to visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Chinese people extend a warm welcome to President Nkrumah, who comes from the distant African continent.
　　The people of Ghana are people with a glorious tradition of struggle against imperialism and colonialism. British imperialism ruled Ghana for nearly a century. After a long period of struggle, the people of Ghana finally achieved independence. After independence, the people of Ghana continued to struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism, to safeguard national independence and develop the national economy. The Chinese people have the highest respect for the hardworking and courageous people of Ghana, and are sincerely happy for every achievement they have made on the road of independent development.
　　Africa and Asia are both regions where the anti-imperialist revolutionary storm is rising today. The African people's struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism is rising one after another. Imperialism has not been able to suppress the struggle of the people of Congo (Leopoldville) for liberation, and around the issue of Southern Rhodesia, the African people have set off a new upsurge in the anti-imperialist struggle. On this continent, the flames of struggle of the people of Congo (Leopoldville), the people of Mozambique, the people of Angola, and the people of Portuguese Guinea are still burning. Now, the people of Equatorial Guinea have also followed suit and launched an armed struggle against colonialism. In Asia, one sees that the anti-American struggles of the people of Japan, the people of South Korea, the people of Laos, and the people of Thailand are surging. The people of Cambodia are also waging a struggle to safeguard national independence and national sovereignty. In particular, the people of Vietnam are waging a great war of resistance against America for national salvation. The outcome of this struggle is not only related to the interests of the Vietnamese people, but also to the common interests of the Asian and African people. The living facts prove that the Asian and African people have common historical experiences, and today they face a common enemy and a common struggle task. In the struggle against imperialism, the destinies of the Asian and African people have been closely linked together.
　　U.S. imperialism is accustomed to using counter-revolutionary tactics of armed suppression and political deception to strangle and undermine the struggles of the Asian and African people to win and safeguard national independence. It used these two tactics in Africa to deal with the people of Congo (Leopoldville), and now it is using the same two tactics in Asia to deal with the people of Vietnam. U.S. imperialism is constantly increasing its troops in South Vietnam and expanding its war of aggression against South Vietnam, but at the same time, it is also playing the "peace talks" fraud in a big way, attempting to make the Vietnamese people lay down their arms and stop fighting, in order to achieve its goal of permanently occupying South Vietnam. Faced with this vicious conspiracy of U.S. imperialism, the Asian and African people need to further strengthen their unity, sympathize with and support each other, unite as one, and resolutely support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America for national salvation.
　　Although China and Ghana are thousands of miles apart, the people of the two countries have forged a deep friendship in the long-term struggle against imperialism and colonialism. Since the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Ghana in 1960, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries have been continuously developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. President Nkrumah's visit to China in 1961 and Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Ghana in 1964 further strengthened the friendship and cooperation between the two countries and the two peoples. We believe that President Nkrumah's visit to our country this time will also make new contributions to enhancing the friendship between China and Ghana.

### 欢迎恩克鲁玛总统

　　欢迎恩克鲁玛总统
    应中华人民共和国政府的邀请，加纳共和国总统克瓦米·恩克鲁玛博士在前往访问越南民主共和国的途中，将于今天顺路来我国进行友好访问。中国人民对来自遥远的非洲大陆的恩克鲁玛总统表示热烈的欢迎。
    加纳人民是具有反对帝国主义和殖民主义光荣斗争传统的人民。英帝国主义统治了加纳近一个世纪。经过长期的斗争，加纳人民终于取得了独立。在独立以后，加纳人民继续为反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、维护民族独立和发展民族经济而斗争。中国人民对勤劳、勇敢的加纳人民怀着崇高的敬意，为他们在独立发展的道路上所取得的每一项成就感到由衷的高兴。
    非洲和亚洲，都是今天反帝革命风暴的高涨地区。非洲人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，一波未平，一波又起。帝国主义没有能够镇压得了刚果（利）人民争取解放的斗争，而围绕着南罗得西亚问题，非洲人民又掀起了一个反帝斗争的新高潮。在这个大陆上，刚果（利）人民、莫三鼻给人民、安哥拉人民、葡属几内亚人民的斗争烈火，还在继续燃烧，现在，赤道几内亚人民也接踵而来，展开了反对殖民主义的武装斗争。在亚洲，人们看到，日本人民、南朝鲜人民、老挝人民、泰国人民的反美斗争，风起云涌。柬埔寨人民也进行着维护民族独立和国家主权的斗争。特别是越南人民，他们正在进行着一场伟大的抗美救国斗争。这场斗争的结局，不仅关系到越南人民的利益，而且也关系到亚非人民的共同利益。活生生的事实证明，亚非人民有着共同的历史遭遇，今天又面临着共同的敌人和共同的斗争任务。在反对帝国主义的斗争中，亚非人民的命运已经紧紧地联结在一起。
    美帝国主义惯于用武装镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手，来扼杀和破坏亚非人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争。它在非洲用这两手对付刚果（利）人民，现在也在亚洲用同样两手来对付越南人民。美帝国主义不断地增兵南越，扩大侵略南越的战争，但同时又大肆玩弄“和谈”骗局，妄图使越南人民放下武器，停止斗争，以达到它永远霸占南越的目的。面对着美帝国主义的这一恶毒阴谋，亚非人民需要更进一步加强团结，相互同情和相互支援，共同一致，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。
    中国和加纳虽然相距万里，但是两国人民在长期反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中，结成了深厚的友谊。自从一九六○年中国和加纳正式建交以来，我们两国的友好合作关系在和平共处五项原则的基础上得到了不断的发展。一九六一年恩克鲁玛总统来我国访问和一九六四年周恩来总理访问加纳，进一步加强了两国和两国人民之间的友谊和合作。我们相信，恩克鲁玛总统这一次来我国访问，也将为增进中加两国的友谊作出新的贡献。
