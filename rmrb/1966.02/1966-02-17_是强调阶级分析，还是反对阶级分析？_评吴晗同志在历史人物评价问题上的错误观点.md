    Emphasize Class Analysis or Oppose Class Analysis?
    ——A Critique of Comrade Wu Han's Erroneous Views on the Evaluation of Historical Figures
    Wu Weixuan
    Abstract: Comrade Wu Han claims that he emphasizes the need to "reduce the activities of historical figures to class activities," which is a lie. First, he unilaterally emphasizes the individuality and particularity of historical figures, thereby extracting their class attributes; second, he opposes class analysis of historical figures under the pretext of opposing "the theory of solely judging by class origin"; third, he opposes pointing out the class limitations of the ancients. The "then and there standard" he advocates for evaluating historical figures is primarily the standard of the then and there exploiting classes, a standard fundamentally opposed to the method of class analysis.
    In his "Self-Criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'," Comrade Wu Han still believes that his views on the evaluation of historical figures are basically correct because he once emphasized that "the evaluation of historical figures should start from the struggle for production and class struggle, and be reduced to class activities," and that only the so-called "then and there standard" has problems. He did not distinguish between evaluating historical figures from a historical materialist viewpoint and comparing historical figures with people of their own historical period and contemporaries, and did not distinguish between the standards of landlords and bureaucrats and the standards of the masses.
    This is not "self-criticism," but self-justification. A study of Comrade Wu Han's opinions published in recent years reveals that his views on the evaluation of historical figures are not basically correct but fundamentally wrong, and the errors are not limited to the so-called "then and there standard," nor are they simply a failure to distinguish between different issues, but a systematic dissemination of historical idealist and anti-Marxist views. As for the so-called "evaluation of historical figures should start from the struggle for production and class struggle, and be reduced to class activities," it is merely a guise for Comrade Wu Han to spread his erroneous views.
    A fundamental principle in evaluating historical figures is to see which class's interests they represent. Only by clarifying the class attributes of historical figures, and clarifying the historical position and historical role of the class they represent, can we truly give historical figures the status they deserve and a proper evaluation. Leaving class analysis will inevitably lead to wrong conclusions. Whether to adhere to class analysis or to abandon class analysis is a fundamental sign distinguishing Marxism from non-Marxism, and historical materialism from historical idealism.
    Comrade Wu Han has written many articles on the evaluation of historical figures. His basic view is to oppose reducing the activities of historical figures to class activities, and to oppose class analysis of historical figures. Comrade Wu Han's articles emphasize the following three arguments.
    One-sidedly Emphasizing the Individuality of Characters, Remaining Silent on Class Nature
    The first argument is to unilaterally emphasize the particularity and individuality of historical figures, unilaterally emphasize the need for individual study, and not to mention the commonality and class nature of historical figures, nor to study them under specific conditions of class struggle. In fact, this is to extract the class attributes of historical figures. Comrade Wu Han said:
    "The object of evaluation is people. This person and that person are different, and in reality, it is impossible for people to have completely identical thoughts, actions, and roles. Therefore, analyzing one historical figure cannot replace the analysis of other figures. People are very complex, not like dissecting a pig to understand its physiology. Moreover, history is also very complex. Different historical figures are produced in different historical periods, with different historical conditions and different historical roles. From the perspective of each specific figure, there are different family backgrounds, personalities, thoughts, political situations, and social roots. Therefore, merely understanding individual historical figures cannot explain the entire historical process, nor can it inherit this precious legacy. It is still necessary to conduct individual and specific research, analysis, and evaluation of different historical figures."①
    In this long passage, Comrade Wu Han only talks about how to specifically analyze historical figures, without a single word mentioning the class nature of people or the need to conduct class analysis of historical figures.
    Indeed, people are more complex than pigs. However, there are no two completely identical pigs in the world either. Dissecting a pig to understand its physiology is nothing more than grasping the common things that form the physiological characteristics of pigs. Analyzing the social attributes of people is naturally much more complex than understanding the physiological characteristics of animals, and the differences between people are much greater than the differences between animals. However, it is equally necessary to first grasp those common attributes, and then examine those things that belong to individual characteristics. In class society, the most fundamental common attribute of people is class nature. When Marx and Engels discussed the role of individuals, they said: "They are not in this social relationship as individuals, but as members of a class."② Lenin once pointed out that the emergence of the theory of class struggle has made the "activities of ‘individuals’ within the scope of each socio-economic formation, these extremely diverse activities that seem impossible to systematize, have been integrated... and reduced to class activities."③ However, Comrade Wu Han only emphasizes the particularity of historical figures, emphasizing that this person is different from that person, emphasizing the understanding of the entire historical process through the individual study of historical figures, while completely obliterating the commonality and class nature of historical figures. This is, in fact, opposing class analysis of historical figures, and opposing reducing the activities of historical figures to class activities. Using this method to conduct research, it is impossible to make a correct evaluation of individual figures, let alone have an understanding of the entire historical process. Because, without talking about class and class struggle, it is impossible to grasp the essence and mainstream of history. To conduct individual studies of historical figures in this way is bound to be overwhelmed in the endless ocean of historical facts and materials. This viewpoint and research method is nothing but historical idealism and metaphysics.
    Comrade Wu Han's theory of using particularity to oppose commonality, and using individuality to oppose class nature is not new. At the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries, neo-Kantians, such as Rickert and Windelband, used this so-called "individual descriptive method" to oppose historical materialism. In 1963, Mr. Feng Youlan also used this theory to oppose the study of the regularity of history④. Comrade Wu Han's use of this reactionary historical idealist theory to oppose the class analysis method of evaluating historical figures can truly be described as "I am not alone."
    Under the Guise of Opposing "the Theory of Solely Judging by Class Origin," Confusing Class Boundaries
    Comrade Wu Han's second argument against using class analysis methods to evaluate historical figures is to oppose the so-called "theory of solely judging by class origin," or "the simplification and vulgarization of class analysis," and "recklessly making class appraisals for the ancients."
    In complex and fierce class struggles, some people may change their original class positions due to subjective and objective factors. In the high tide of peasant wars, individual landlord elements betraying their class and joining the peasant revolutionary camp, or peasant uprising leaders betraying their class and transforming into feudal landlord class, such examples are not isolated. The evaluation of these historical figures should indeed be based on their specific performance, and not merely on their original class origin.
    However, Comrade Wu Han's opposition to "the theory of solely judging by class origin" is not what this means. Because what he is talking about are representatives of the ancient feudal landlord class. This is a matter of two different natures from the above.
    The representatives of the ancient feudal landlord class generally came from the landlord class and represented the interests of the landlord class. Their origins and composition are consistent with their own thoughts and activities. There is generally no question of changing class positions here, and there is no question of them betraying their class or getting rid of the ideological influence of their class and accepting the ideological influence of other classes.
    Under certain historical conditions, some representatives of the exploiting classes have played a positive role in the development of history. Their achievements cannot be denied because they came from the exploiting class. However, we must never forget the class nature of them and their achievements because they have achievements, or think that their class position has changed because they have achievements. If analyzing the class nature of historical figures and their achievements is regarded as "the theory of solely judging by class origin," then what else is it but opposing class analysis methods?
    Comrade Wu Han's so-called opposition to "the theory of solely judging by class origin" is precisely this. Look at his passage:
        "Class origin is not the only condition for evaluating historical figures. People can change, past, present, and future. A person from a landlord-bureaucrat class background may become a bad person, but not all of them are bad people. Cao Cao, Wu Zetian, and Hai Rui all had bad origins. In the past, some great painters, calligraphers, and artists were also from large landlord class backgrounds. Because in the past society, only they had the opportunity to learn culture. We must never unilaterally deny their historical achievements because of the class origins of these historical figures, and we must make distinctions. At the same time, we must also have connections. The influence of family and society will more or less have an impact on a person's development, and it cannot be said that class origin and personal development have no connection. Saying that is also incorrect."⑤
    For the activities of those emperors and generals that Comrade Wu Han mentioned, class origin and the influence given to them by their own class are essential and decisive factors, and not a question of "more or less" influence. No matter what role these emperors and generals played in history, what contributions they made, or how hard they personally worked to cultivate their thoughts and morals, they were still representatives of the interests of the landlord class. Their achievements, contributions, and cultivation could not exceed the scope defined by the interests of the landlord class, and they could not change their class position.
    However, according to Comrade Wu Han's statement, class origin is not the decisive condition for evaluating emperors and generals. As long as they work hard, they can not become "bad people," but become "good people." What are the "good people" in Comrade Wu Han's mind? These are Cao Cao, Wu Zetian, Hai Rui, Kuang Zhong, and so on. In Comrade Wu Han's writing, the actions of these people have exceeded the scope of the interests of the landlord class, and have become "saviors of the people," "violating the interests of the ruling group at that time," "attacking bureaucratic landlords, protecting small and medium landlords, poor and middle peasants, and citizens," "breaking the old state machine and establishing a new state machine," "seeking welfare for the people," "gaining the support of the people," and the people "regard them as gods." The representatives of the landlord class, even the highest representatives—the emperors—can actually represent the interests of the people and fight against the class they came from. They have changed their class position and betrayed their class. This is a very absurd statement.
    It can be seen that Comrade Wu Han's so-called "opposition to the theory of solely judging by class origin" and opposition to "recklessly making class appraisals for the ancients" is actually to change the class composition of emperors and generals and pull them into the ranks of the masses.
    Comrade Wu Han only talks about the fact that the achievements of historical writers, artists, philosophers, and scientists from exploiting class backgrounds should not be denied in their professional fields⑥, but he does not mention at all that class viewpoints should be used to analyze these achievements. It is true that the achievements of some writers, artists, philosophers, and scientists from exploiting class backgrounds should be affirmed in their professional fields, but this affirmation cannot be abstract either. It is necessary to analyze which class these achievements belong to, which class's mark they bear, and what their shortcomings, negative aspects, and even reactionary aspects are. Since these achievements often have strong personal characteristics, exploring the class origins, experiences, and influence of the class of these writers, artists, philosophers, and scientists is of great significance.
    Taking Wang Wei, whom Comrade Wu Han mentioned, as an example. The themes and styles in his poems and paintings, which are leisurely and detached from real life, are precisely derived from his smooth official career and comfortable life as a big landlord and bureaucrat. Without considering Wang Wei's class origin and landlord-bureaucrat social experience, it would be impossible to make a correct evaluation of his achievements and limitations, and it would lead to the beautification and unprincipled praise of the ancients.
    Comrade Wu Han's evaluation of ancient thinkers, artists, writers, and scientists, such as Sima Qian, Xu Xiake, and Tan Qian, is exactly like this. For example, in the article "The Great Historian Sima Qian," Comrade Wu Han made a comprehensive affirmation of Sima Qian's behavior, scholarship, and writing, and even mentioned that the fine tradition of the unity of historiography and literature in Chinese historical works was "further promoted and developed through Sima Qian's efforts, and will always be worthy of inheritance, learning, and admiration by later generations"⑦. However, the entire article does not mention a single word that Sima Qian was a historian of the feudal landlord class, does not mention a single word about his historical idealist viewpoint, and does not talk about the limitations and shortcomings of his political thought, academic viewpoints, and research methods. Using this attitude to call on us to inherit Sima Qian's tradition and learn from Sima Qian is not beautifying the landlord class, guiding people to look backward, and calling on today's Marxist historical workers to learn from feudal historians. What is it then?
    It can be seen that Comrade Wu Han's opposition to "the theory of solely judging by class origin," which separates the evaluation of the historical achievements of the ancients from the class analysis of the ancients, is actually using this as an excuse to confuse class boundaries, oppose class analysis methods, and promote restorationism and spread feudal toxins.
    Using the Excuse that Everyone Has Limitations to Oppose Analyzing the Limitations of the Ancients
    Comrade Wu Han's third argument against evaluating historical figures with the class analysis method is to oppose analyzing the limitations of the ancients.
    Comrade Wu Han believes that the evaluation of historical figures can only be based on the historical conditions at that time, looking at what new things they provided more than their predecessors, and opposing the discussion of the shortcomings, errors, and limitations of historical figures. Comrade Wu Han's reason is:
          "Which era of people has no limitations? How can people of our era not have limitations? … It should be clear that limitations are not limited to the ancients. People of any era have them, and not only do we have limitations, but future people will also have them. I don’t think it is in accordance with principles to use this to demand and criticize the ancients.”⑧
    In order to prove his point, Comrade Wu Han also quoted a passage from Lenin: "Judging historical merits is not based on what historical activists did not provide what is required by modern times, but on what new things they provided more than their predecessors."⑨ He believes that this is a fundamental principle for evaluating historical figures.
    However, this passage from Lenin refers only to the principle of judging the merits of historical figures, not the fundamental principle or the entire principle of evaluating historical figures. Lenin said this when evaluating the petty-bourgeois economist Sismondi. In the same article, Lenin pointed out Sismondi's merits, but also pointed out his shortcomings, limitations, and errors. Therefore, Comrade Wu Han's use of this passage from Lenin to oppose the analysis of the limitations of the ancients is wrong.
    Indeed, the ancients have limitations, the moderns also have limitations, and the proletariat also has limitations. Can we not or not be allowed to analyze the limitations of the ancients because everyone has limitations? No, we cannot. Limitation is a historical category. The limitations of people in different eras and different classes are different. We cannot completely cancel the analysis of limitations because everyone has limitations. Just as we cannot use emphasizing the particularity of individual figures to oppose the commonality—class nature—of historical figures, we cannot, in the issue of historical limitations, unilaterally emphasize the commonality of historical figures and oppose the analysis of their particularity.
    More importantly, historical limitations have different contents. There is the era limitation that comes with the level of social practice of an era; in the same era, there is the class limitation that comes with the interests and historical position of different classes; for each individual, in addition to the limitations of the era and class, there are also the limitations of personal knowledge and activity ability. The contents of these limitations are different, and the effects are also different. In the same feudal society, the limitations of peasants are different from the limitations of landlords. The class position of peasants makes them resolutely oppose feudal exploitation and demand revolution, but they cannot see the future of their revolution and cannot overthrow the feudal system; while the class position of landlords prompts them to greedily exploit peasants and resolutely oppose peasant revolution. As for the proletariat, because its fundamental interests are completely consistent with the laws of social development, it always represents all new things and always stands at the forefront of social development trends. After this class changes from a class in itself to a class for itself, their cognitive activities can always be consistent with the limits that social practice can enable people to reach. Therefore, the proletariat has no class limitations, but the limits that the level of human social practice activities in the era in which they live can reach are still beyond their reach, and therefore there are still era limitations, and each member of the proletariat still has limitations of personal knowledge and activities. All of these have essential differences and need to be specifically analyzed. If, like Comrade Wu Han, we confuse the limitations of the era with the limitations of the class, and confuse the limitations of the feudal landlord class with the limitations of today's proletariat, this actually denies that the landlord class in the feudal era has class limitations, thereby negating the need to conduct class analysis of historical figures.
    The So-Called "Then and There Standard" is Mainly the Standard of the Then and There Exploiting Classes
    Comrade Wu Han opposes analyzing historical figures with the class analysis method. So, what standard does he use to evaluate historical figures? This is the so-called "then and there standard."
    To evaluate historical figures, we should stand at today's height, that is, we should stand on the proletariat's position and use the viewpoint of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and the method of class analysis to evaluate. Naturally, our evaluation of historical figures cannot be separated from the historical conditions at that time, but we cannot use the standards of that time, but only the standards of today, that is, the standards of Marxism. However, Comrade Wu Han confuses conditions with standards, calls the Marxist standard the standard of today's time and place, opposes it, and uses the so-called "then and there standard" to oppose it.
    Comrade Wu Han made a variety of explanations for the so-called "then and there standard." Sometimes he says that we should start from the opinions or interests of the people at that time and place; sometimes he says that we should start from the records at that time and place; sometimes he says that we should start from the opinions of the majority of people at that time and place; and sometimes he says that we should start from the moral standards at that time and place. In fact, to put it bluntly, it is mainly advocating using the standards of the exploiting classes at that time and place to evaluate historical figures.
    The records that have been passed down to today are mostly records of the exploiting classes. Starting from the records of that time and place can only mean starting from the records of the exploiting classes.
    How can we understand the opinions of the majority of people at that time and place? We can still only rely on the records left by the exploiting classes. Starting from the opinions of the majority of people at that time and place can only mean starting from the opinions of the majority of the exploiting classes at that time and place.
    In societies where the exploiting classes are in a dominant position, it is the morality of the exploiting classes that dominates, and Comrade Wu Han also mistakenly believes that the morality of the ruling class is also the morality of the ruled class. In this way, according to Comrade Wu Han's view, starting from the moral standards of that time and place can only mean starting from the moral standards of the exploiting classes.
    As for the so-called starting from the opinions or interests of the people at that time and place, this is just an excuse. How can we understand the opinions of the people from the records of the exploiting classes? Even if there are records, they are mostly distorted and favorable to the exploited classes. Even if we truly evaluate historical figures according to the opinions or interests of the people at that time, it is nothing more than reducing today's us to the level of understanding of slaves, free men, serfs, or citizens in history, or only emphasizing the local and temporary interests of the people at that time, while ignoring the difference between these interests and the long-term interests of the people and the possible contradictions. In short, this is still not the Marxist standard.
    Therefore, the error of this so-called "then and there standard" is not, as Comrade Wu Han's "self-criticism" says, that it only fails to distinguish between evaluating historical figures from a historical materialist viewpoint and comparing historical figures with people of their own historical period and contemporaries, and distinguishes between the standards of landlords and bureaucrats and the standards of the masses, but it is a standard that is fundamentally opposed to the Marxist standard of evaluating historical figures, and fundamentally opposed to the method of class analysis.
    In the evaluation of historical figures, Comrade Wu Han did not "reduce the activities of historical figures to class activities," but resolutely opposed the method of class analysis. This is a fundamental error, not, as Comrade Wu Han's self-criticism says, basically correct, and the error is only partial and secondary.
    In the field of historical science, there has always been a struggle between Marxism and anti-Marxism, and between historical materialism and historical idealism. This is a reflection of class struggle in the academic field. During the three years of difficulties from 1960 to 1962, the bourgeoisie launched another frenzied attack on us. The academic field is not a haven, and there was also a fierce class struggle at that time. Comrade Wu Han happened to write a large number of articles and spread a large number of erroneous views between 1960 and 1962. This is by no means a random coincidence, but is actually acting as a vanguard for the bourgeoisie's attack on Marxism in the field of historical science. For this reason, it is necessary to discuss Comrade Wu Han's erroneous views, distinguish right from wrong, and eliminate the impact, so as to achieve the goal of promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie, and to improve our level of Marxism-Leninism and improve our level of historical research.

### 是强调阶级分析，还是反对阶级分析？——评吴晗同志在历史人物评价问题上的错误观点

    是强调阶级分析，还是反对阶级分析？
    ——评吴晗同志在历史人物评价问题上的错误观点
    武慰萱
    提要　吴晗同志说他强调要把历史人物的活动“归结为阶级的活动”，这是谎话。首先，他片面强调历史人物的个别性、特殊性，从而抽掉了历史人物的阶级属性；其次，以反对“唯成分论”为借口，反对对历史人物进行阶级分析；第三，反对指出古人的阶级局限性。他所主张的评价历史人物的“当时当地标准”，主要是当时当地剥削阶级的标准，是同阶级分析方法根本对立的标准。
    吴晗同志在《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》里，仍然认为他在历史人物评价问题上基本上是正确的，因为他曾经强调“评价历史人物要从生产斗争和阶级斗争出发，归结为阶级的活动”，只是所谓“当时当地标准”有问题，没有把用历史唯物主义观点评价历史人物同把历史人物放在他自己的历史时期和同时代人相比这两件事区分清楚，没有把地主官僚的标准同人民大众的标准区分清楚。
    这不是“自我批评”，而是自我辩解。只要研究一下吴晗同志近几年所发表的有关意见，就可以看到他在历史人物评价问题上的观点不是基本正确而是根本错误，错误也不仅是所谓“当时当地标准”，更不仅是没有把不同的问题区分清楚，而是系统地散布历史唯心主义的、反马克思主义的观点。至于所谓“评价历史人物要从生产斗争和阶级斗争出发，归结为阶级的活动”，则不过是吴晗同志借以散布其错误观点的一个幌子而已。
    评价历史人物的一个根本原则，是要看他们代表哪个阶级的利益。只有弄清历史人物的阶级属性，弄清他们所代表的阶级的历史地位和历史作用，才能真正给予历史人物以应有的地位和恰当的评价。离开阶级分析，必然要得出错误的结论。是坚持阶级分析，还是不要阶级分析，这是区别马克思主义同非马克思主义、历史唯物主义同历史唯心主义的一个根本标志。
    吴晗同志写了很多有关评价历史人物的文章。他的基本观点，是反对把历史人物的活动归结为阶级的活动，反对对历史人物进行阶级分析。吴晗同志在文章中，十分强调以下三个论据。
    片面强调人物的个性，闭口不谈阶级性
    第一个论据，是片面强调历史人物的特殊性、个性，片面强调必须逐个地进行研究，而不提历史人物的共同性、阶级性，不把他们放到特定的阶级斗争条件下来研究。实际上这是抽掉了历史人物的阶级属性。吴晗同志说：
    “评价的对象是人。这人和那人是各不相同的，实际上
  不可能存在思想意识、行动和作用完全相同的人，以此，分
  析了一个历史人物并不能代替对其他人物的分析。人很复杂，
  不象解剖一个猪就可以了解猪的生理那样。而且历史也很复
  杂，不同的历史人物产生在不同的历史时期，有不同的历史
  条件，不同的历史作用。从每一个具体人物说，又有不同的
  家世、性格、思想、政治情况和社会根源。因此，光是了解
  个别历史人物是不能说明整个历史进程，也无从继承这份珍
  贵的遗产的，还必须对不同历史人物作逐个的具体的研究、分
  析和评价。”①
    在这一大段话里，吴晗同志只讲如何具体分析历史人物，没有一个字提到人的阶级性，和对历史人物要进行阶级分析。
    的确，人比猪要复杂。但是，世界上也没有两只完全一样的猪。解剖一只猪能够了解猪的生理，无非是抓住了形成猪的生理特征的那些共同的东西。分析人的社会属性自然比了解动物的生理特征要复杂得多，人跟人之间的差别也比动物之间的差别大得多。但是，同样也必须首先抓住那些共同的属性，然后再考察那些属于个人的特征的东西。在阶级社会，人的最根本的共同属性就是阶级性。马克思和恩格斯论到个人的作用时曾经说过：“他们不是作为个人而是作为阶级的成员处于这种社会关系中的。”②列宁曾经指出，阶级斗争理论的出现，使得“‘个人’在每个社会经济形态范围内的活动，这些极为多样的似乎不能加以任何系统化的活动，已被综合起来，……归结为阶级的活动”③。可是，吴晗同志只强调历史人物的特殊性，强调这个人跟那个人不同，强调通过对历史人物进行逐个的研究来了解整个历史的进程，却完全抹杀了历史人物的共同性、阶级性，这实际上是反对对历史人物进行阶级分析，反对把历史人物的活动归结为阶级的活动。用这种方法去进行研究，既谈不到对个别人物作出正确的评价，更谈不到对整个历史进程有所了解。因为，不谈阶级和阶级斗争，就无法掌握历史的本质和主流。这样去对历史人物进行逐个逐个的研究，势必要在无穷无尽的史实和史料的汪洋大海中灭顶。这种观点和研究方法不是别的，只能是历史唯心主义和形而上学。
    吴晗同志这种用特殊性来反对共同性，用个性来反对阶级性的理论并不新鲜。十九世纪末二十世纪初的新康德主义者，如李凯尔特、文德尔班等人，就用这种所谓“个别记述方法”来反对历史唯物主义。一九六三年冯友兰先生也曾用这种理论来反对研究历史的规律性④。吴晗同志搬用这种反动的历史唯心主义理论来反对评价历史人物的阶级分析方法，真可算是“吾道不孤”了。
    在反对“唯成分论”的幌子下，混淆阶级界限
    吴晗同志反对评价历史人物要用阶级分析方法的第二个论据，是反对所谓“唯成分论”，或者叫做“把阶级分析片面化、庸俗化”，“胡乱替古人作阶级鉴定”。
    在复杂激烈的阶级斗争中，有些人由于主客观的因素，是可能改变自己原来的阶级立场的。在农民战争高潮中间，个别地主分子背叛自己的阶级投身农民革命阵营，或者农民起义领袖背叛自己的阶级向封建地主阶级转化，这样的事例都不是个别的。对这些历史人物的评价，确实应当看他们的具体表现，而不应当仅仅看他们原来的阶级出身。
    但是，吴晗同志反对“唯成分论”，并不是这个意思。因为他所谈论的，是古代封建地主阶级的代表人物。这同上面所说的，是两个不同性质的问题。
    古代封建地主的代表人物，他们一般出身地主阶级，代表地主阶级的利益。他们的出身、成分，同他们自身的思想、活动是一致的。这里一般并不存在改变阶级立场问题，并不存在他们背叛自己的阶级或者摆脱自己阶级的思想影响、接受其他阶级的思想影响的问题。
    在一定的历史条件下，剥削阶级的某些代表人物对历史的发展起过积极的作用。不能因为他们出身剥削阶级而否定他们的成就。但是，也决不能因为他们有成就而忘掉了他们及其成就的阶级性质，或者因为他们有了成就而认为他们阶级立场已经转变。如果把分析历史人物及其成就的阶级性当成是“唯成分论”，那不是反对阶级分析方法又是什么呢？
    吴晗同志的所谓反对“唯成分论”，正是这样。请看他的这段话：
        “阶级出身不是评价历史人物的唯一条件。人是可以
    改变的，过去、今天、将来都是如此。一个地主官僚阶级
    出身的人可能成为坏人，但不一定都是坏人，曹操、武则
    天、海瑞出身全不好，过去有些大画家、书法家、美术
    家，也都是大地主阶级出身。因为在过去社会里，只有他
    们这些人才享有文化学习的机会。我们决不能为这些历史
    人物的阶级出身而片面否定他们的历史成就，要有区别。同
    时，也要有联系，家世和社会的影响对一个人的发展或多
    或少都会是有的，也不可以说阶级出身和个人的发展毫无
    联系，这样说，也是不对的。”⑤
    对于吴晗同志所说的那些帝王将相的活动，阶级出身和他们本阶级给予他们的影响是本质的、决定性的因素，而不是什么“或多或少”的影响的问题。不论这些帝王将相对历史起过什么作用，有过什么贡献，也不论他们个人如何努力进行思想道德的修养，他们终归还是地主阶级利益的代表者，他们的成就、贡献、修养不可能越出地主阶级利益所划定的范围，他们也不能改变自己的阶级立场。
    可是，照吴晗同志的说法，阶级出身并不是评价帝王将相的决定条件。只要自己努力，就可以不成为“坏人”，而成为“好人”。什么是吴晗同志心目中的“好人”呢？这就是曹操、武则天、海瑞、况钟等等。在吴晗同志的笔下，这些人的作为已经超出了地主阶级利益的范围，成了“人民的救星”，“违反当时统治集团的利益”，“打击官僚地主、保护中小地主和贫农中农以及市民”，“打破旧国家机器建立新国家机器”，“为人民谋福利”，“得到人民的支持”，人民把他们“看作天神一样”。地主阶级的代表，甚至是最高的代表——帝王，竟然可以代表人民的利益，向自己出身的阶级进行斗争，他们已经改变了阶级立场，背叛了自己的阶级。这是十分荒谬的说法。
    可见，吴晗同志的所谓“反对唯成分论”，反对“胡乱替古人作阶级鉴定”，实际上是替帝王将相改变阶级成分，把他们拉进人民群众的队伍中来。
    吴晗同志只谈到不能因为历史上的文学家、艺术家、哲学家、科学家出身剥削阶级，就否定他们在专业方面的成就⑥，却完全不提应当运用阶级观点来分析这些成就。不错，对于某些出身于剥削阶级的文学家、艺术家、哲学家、科学家在专业方面的成就应当肯定，但这种肯定同样不能是抽象的，必须分析这些成就属于哪个阶级，带着哪个阶级的烙印，它们不足之处与消极乃至反动的方面又是什么。由于这些成就往往带有浓厚的个人特色，探索这些文学家、艺术家、哲学家、科学家的阶级出身、经历和本阶级的影响，就有重要的意义。
    以吴晗同志举过的王维为例。他的诗和画中那种恬淡闲适、脱离现实生活的题材和风格，正是从他清顺的仕宦经历和安适的大地主官僚生活中产生出来的。离开了王维的阶级出身和地主官僚社会经历，就无法对他的成就和局限作出正确的评价，就会导致对古人的美化和无原则的歌颂。
    吴晗同志对古代的思想家、艺术家、文学家、科学家如司马迁、徐霞客、谈迁等人的评价，正是如此。例如，在《伟大的历史学家司马迁》这篇文章里，吴晗同志对司马迁的为人行事、学问文章，作了全面的肯定，甚至提到我国历史著作中史学和文学是统一的这个优良传统，“经过司马迁的努力而更加发扬光大，永远值得后人继承、学习和敬仰”⑦。可是，通篇文章就是没有一个字提到司马迁是封建地主阶级的史学家，没有一个字提到他的历史唯心主义观点，没有一个字谈到他的政治思想、学术观点和治学方法的局限和不足之处。用这种态度来号召我们继承司马迁的传统，向司马迁学习，不是美化地主阶级，引导人们向后看，号召今天的马克思主义的历史工作者向封建史学家看齐，又是什么呢？
    可见，吴晗同志标榜反对“唯成分论”，把评价古人的历史成就同对古人进行阶级分析对立起来，割裂开来，实际上是以此为借口，混淆阶级界限，反对阶级分析方法，来宣传复古主义，散布封建毒素。
    借口人人都有局限性，反对分析古人的局限性
    吴晗同志反对以阶级分析方法评价历史人物的第三个论据，是反对分析古人的局限性。
    吴晗同志认为，评价历史人物只能根据当时的历史条件，看他们比他们的前辈多提供了什么新的东西，反对谈论历史上人物的缺点、错误和局限性。吴晗同志的理由是：
          “哪个时代的人没有局限性呢，我们这个时代的人又
    何尝没有局限性呢？……应该明确，局限性不限于古
    人，是任何时代人都有的，不只是我们自己有局限性，将来
    的人还会有，拿这个来要求、批评古人，我看并不是合于
    原则的。”⑧
    为了证明他的这个论点，吴晗同志还引了列宁的一段话：“判断历史的功绩，不是根据历史活动家没有提供现代所要求的东西，而是根据他们比他们的前辈提供了新的东西。”⑨他认为这是评价历史人物的一个根本原则。
    但是，列宁这段话指的只是判断历史人物功绩的原则，并不是评价历史人物的根本原则或全部原则。列宁这段话是评价小资产阶级经济学家西斯蒙第时讲的。就在同一篇文章里，列宁指出西斯蒙第的功绩，同时也指出了他的不足、局限和错误。因此，吴晗同志拿列宁这段话来反对分析古人局限性是错误的。
    不错，古人有局限性，今人也有局限性，无产阶级也有局限性。能不能因为都有局限性就不必或者不许分析古人的局限性呢？不行。局限性是个历史的范畴，不同时代不同阶级的人的局限性是不同的，不能因为大家都有局限性，就根本取消分析局限性。正同不能用强调个别人物的特殊性来反对历史人物的共同性——阶级性一样，也不能在历史局限性问题上，片面强调历史人物的共同性而反对分析其特殊性。
    更重要的是，历史局限性是有不同的内容的。有随一个时代社会实践水平而来的时代局限性；在同一个时代，有随不同阶级利益及其历史地位而来的阶级局限性；就每个个人来说，在时代和阶级的局限性之外，还有个人认识和活动能力的局限性。这些局限性的内容是不相同的，作用也是不相同的。同是封建社会，农民的局限性同地主的局限性就不相同。农民的阶级地位使他们坚决反对封建剥削，要求革命，却认不清自己革命的前途，无法推翻封建制度；而地主的阶级地位则促使他们贪婪地剥削农民，坚决地反对农民革命。至于无产阶级，由于他的根本利益和社会发展规律完全一致，永远代表一切新生的事物，永远站在社会发展潮流的顶端。在这个阶级从自在的阶级变成自为的阶级之后，他们的认识活动就永远能同社会实践所能使人达到的限度一致。因此，无产阶级没有阶级局限性，但是他们所在的时代的人类社会实践活动水平所能达到的限度，则仍是他们所不能超越的，因而仍旧有时代的局限性，无产阶级每个成员也仍然有个人认识和活动的局限性。这种种都有本质的区别，都需要进行具体的分析。如果象吴晗同志那样，把时代的局限性同阶级的局限性混为一谈，把封建地主阶级的局限性同今天无产阶级的局限性混为一谈，这实际上就是否认封建时代的地主阶级有阶级局限性，从而也就否定了对历史人物要进行阶级分析。
    所谓“当时当地标准”，主要是当时当地剥削阶级的标准
    吴晗同志是反对用阶级分析方法来分析历史人物的，那么，他用什么标准来评价历史人物呢？这就是所谓“当时当地标准”。
    评价历史人物，应当站在今天的高度，即要站在无产阶级立场，用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的观点，阶级分析的方法来进行评价。自然，我们评价历史人物不能脱离当时的历史条件，但不能用当时的标准而只能用今天的标准即马克思主义的标准。可是，吴晗同志却把条件同标准混为一谈，把马克思主义的标准叫做今时今地标准加以反对，而用所谓当时当地标准来同它对立。
    对于所谓当时当地标准，吴晗同志作了五花八门的解释。一会儿说，要从当时当地人民的意见或者利益出发；一会儿说，要从当时当地的记载出发；一会儿说，要从当时当地大多数人的意见出发；一会儿又说，要从当时当地的道德标准出发。其实说穿了，主要就是主张用当时当地剥削阶级的标准来评价历史人物。
    今天流传下来的记载，绝大多数是剥削阶级的记载。从当时当地的记载出发，只能意味着从剥削阶级的记载出发。
    如何了解当时当地多数人的意见呢？还是只能根据剥削阶级留下的记载。从当时当地多数人的意见出发，只能意味着从当时当地大多数剥削阶级的意见出发。
    在剥削阶级占统治地位的社会，占统治地位的是剥削阶级的道德，而且吴晗同志更错误地认为，统治阶级的道德论也就是被统治阶级的道德论。这样，照吴晗同志的看法，从当时当地的道德标准出发，只能意味着从剥削阶级的道德标准出发。
    至于所谓从当时当地人民的意见或者利益出发，这也不过是一个借口。从剥削阶级的记载中怎么能了解到人民的意见呢？即使有记载，也多半是那些被剥削阶级歪曲了的、对他们有利的东西。即使真正照着当时人民的意见或者利益来评价历史人物，也无非是把今天的我们降低到历史上的奴隶、自由民、农奴或者市民的认识水平，或者只是强调当时人民的局部的、暂时的利益，而忽视了这种利益与人民长远利益之间的区别和可能出现的矛盾。总之，这仍然不是马克思主义的标准。
    因此，这种所谓“当时当地标准”的错误，并不象吴晗同志的“自我批评”所说的那样，仅是没有把用历史唯物主义观点评价历史人物同把历史人物放在他自己的历史时期和同时代人相比这两件事区分清楚，把地主官僚的标准同人民大众的标准区分清楚，而是一个同马克思主义评价历史人物的标准根本对立的标准，同阶级分析方法根本对立的标准。
    吴晗同志在历史人物评价问题上，并不是把历史人物的活动“归结为阶级的活动”，而是坚决反对阶级分析方法。这是根本性的错误，而不是象吴晗同志自我批评所说的那样，是基本正确的，错误只是部分的、次要的。
    在历史科学领域里，从来就存在着马克思主义同反马克思主义、历史唯物主义同历史唯心主义的斗争，这是阶级斗争在学术领域内的反映。在一九六○年到一九六二年的三年困难时期中，资产阶级向我们发动了又一次猖狂的进攻。学术领域不是世外桃源，当时也同样存在着激烈的阶级斗争。吴晗同志正好在一九六○年到一九六二年间写了大量的文章，散布了大量的错误观点，这决不是偶然的巧合，实际上是当了资产阶级在历史科学领域中向马克思主义进攻的先锋。正因为这样，就必须对吴晗同志的错误观点展开讨论，明辨是非，肃清影响，以便做到兴无灭资，使我们的马克思列宁主义的水平提高一步，使我们的历史研究水平提高一步。
