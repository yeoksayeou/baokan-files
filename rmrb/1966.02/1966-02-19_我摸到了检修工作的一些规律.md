    I Discovered Some Regularities in Overhaul Work
    Wang Yonggui, Head of the Equipment Overhaul Team, Changgouyu Coal Mine, Jingxi Mining Bureau

    Editor's Note: The law of unity of opposites is the core of materialist dialectics. With the widespread and in-depth development of the mass movement to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, this core of materialist dialectics is being grasped by more and more workers, peasants, and soldiers, and is playing an increasingly significant role in transforming people's subjective world and, consequently, transforming the objective world. The articles by several worker comrades published here once again prove this point.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "People's social being determines their thinking. And correct ideas representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force for transforming society and the world." This is indeed the case. Comrade Wang Yonggui correctly recognized and handled a series of interrelationships in overhaul work, such as passive and active, good and fast, protagonist and supporting role, which greatly improved his work. Some comrades at Harbin Jilian Machinery Factory studied and applied dialectics and achieved outstanding results in ordinary work.

    Passive and Active

    I used to be a rock-loading driver. In 1961, I started overhauling rock-loading machines. When I first became an overhaul worker, I didn't grasp the regularities of overhaul work. I was really "like a dog biting a hedgehog, not knowing where to start." Several rock-loading machines often malfunctioned, and I was busy dealing with them all day long. Sometimes, I had just finished repairing a rock-loading machine, and before I could even get out of the mine, the phone at the mine entrance was waiting for me to return. I would shuttle back and forth through the several-kilometer-long tunnels, and I didn't even dare take off my work clothes at night. Because the overhaul quality was poor, it affected the tunneling footage, and the workers at the workface had all sorts of complaints. Some said, "This isn't a rock-loading machine, it's a blocking machine, an obstacle machine." My work was very passive, and I was very distressed. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's works, I realized that the reason why the machines were always broken was because I hadn't grasped the performance and the laws of motion of the rock-loading machines. Therefore, on the one hand, I read technical books, and on the other hand, I studied the causes of machine damage during the overhaul process. What is the difference between a rock-loading machine and other machines? Over time, I gradually discovered that the rock-loading machine runs underground every day, constantly "advancing" and "retreating," loading rocks into the bucket and then dumping them into the mine car, colliding with thousands of tons of rocks day and night. This forward and backward impact and constant vibration make the parts of the rock-loading machine very easy to loosen and damage. To overhaul the rock-loading machine well, it is necessary to master this special form of movement of the rock-loading machine. This is the specificity that distinguishes the rock-loading machine from other fixed equipment (such as air compressors, water pumps, winches, etc.). All the faults and wear of the rock-loading machine are mostly caused by this. Mastering this characteristic of the rock-loading machine means grasping the main contradiction in overhaul work. To do a good job in the overhaul of the rock-loading machine, we must reverse the past practice of treating the head when the head aches and treating the foot when the foot aches, and fundamentally strengthen the various parts of the rock-loading machine to extend its life and make it strong and durable. Take the oil leakage problem of the reduction gearbox in the walking part of the rock-loading machine as an example. At first, I thought that the gasket paper was too thin, so I added a layer and brushed on a layer of lead oil, but it still leaked oil. When I checked again, I found that the screws were loose. I punched holes in the screws and used lead wire to fix them, but the oil leakage problem was still not solved. I suspected that the machine structure was not good, but why didn't the reduction gearbox in the lifting part leak oil? I compared the two types of reduction gearboxes and found that the lifting part reduction gearbox was subject to less vibration, while the walking part reduction gearbox was subject to greater vibration, which caused the screws to loosen and the cover plate to be not tight. This was the main reason for the oil leakage. We welded a support iron plate on the bottom of the reduction gearbox to strengthen the reduction gearbox and reduce the impact force on the reduction gearbox. Based on the same principle, we also welded a pressing iron plate on the top of the reduction gearbox to prevent the cover plate from loosening and misaligning. After this improvement, the oil leakage problem of the walking part reduction gearbox was basically solved. This shows that to do a good job in the overhaul of the rock-loading machine, we must master the special law of machine operation of the rock-loading machine and consider all problems of the rock-loading machine from this special law. After doing this, the rock-loading machine broke down less often, the machine life was extended, and my work gradually got on the right track. Chairman Mao taught us: "No matter what you do, if you don't understand the situation of that thing, its nature, its relationship with things outside it, you won't know the laws of that thing, you won't know how to do it, and you won't be able to do that thing well." Why was my work passive in the past and now relatively active? It's because I didn't understand the nature of the rock-loading machine in the past, let alone its connection with large rocks. People were controlled by machines. After I understood the temper of the machine and subdued the machine, the machine obediently obeyed people's orders and served production. My work has also changed from passive to active.

    Good and Fast

    To make the overhaul work of the rock-loading machine adapt to the needs of production, we must ensure good overhaul quality and speed. An important key to achieving good and fast is to prepare sufficient spare parts and accessories. More spare parts should be prepared for those accessories on the rock-loading machine that are easy to damage and have a large consumption. During overhaul, unqualified accessories will not be used to replace them due to the lack of certain accessories, which will affect the quality; nor will work be stopped due to waiting for the processing of certain accessories, which will affect the overhaul speed. In the past, we suffered from insufficient spare parts and accessories. Once, the bearing bush on the drum broke. There were no spare parts, so we had to temporarily ask a turner to turn it. However, we were afraid of affecting production, so the rock-loading machine was operated while sick, which resulted in the screw of the valve piece breaking. The entire machine had to be taken out of the well for repair. Sometimes the machine could not be repaired for a long time because there were no spare parts. We learn from our mistakes. From then on, every time the machine was taken out of the well, we recorded in detail where it was damaged and what accessories were needed, and established an overhaul card to grasp the medical history of each rock-loading machine. In this way, we gradually figured out the rules and knew which accessories were easy to break and which accessories were not easy to break. With sufficient spare parts and accessories, we are prepared for any eventuality, which creates conditions for completing the overhaul task well and quickly.

    The task of overhaul work is to repair the broken machine and ensure quality is the first priority. However, during overhaul, the well is often urged, and we are anxious, and we one-sidedly only pay attention to speed and ignore quality in our thinking. Some comrades don't carefully select parts, saying "If it's an inch off, just make do with it." However, objective laws cannot be met by our subjective wishes. Ignoring quality will either lead to continuous new failures or break down faster. Once, because we were trying to be quick in overhaul, we forgot to add oil to the gears in the reduction gearbox. After the rock-loading machine went down the well, it stopped halfway. The five- or six-ton behemoth could not be pulled out or pushed in. After careful inspection, it was found that because no oil was added, the copper sleeve and shaft in the gear were burned. It was transported from the well to the surface for repair, which took two days and two nights. Originally, we wanted to be fast, but one-sidedly pursuing speed, being busy and chaotic, being careless, and causing accidents resulted in even slower results. Therefore, in overhaul work, we must comprehensively consider the relationship between speed and good. First of all, we must put the word "good" first. Only by seeking more in good can we truly get more, only by seeking fast in good can we truly get fast, and only by seeking saving in good can we truly save. In overhaul work, we must adhere to quality first with an extremely responsible spirit. The more urgent the urging, the more careful we must be in inspection, and the more strictly we must be at the forefront and be meticulous. It is better to delay the machine from going down the well for an hour than to make mistakes in a hurry and cause greater rework and waste. To ensure overhaul quality, sometimes it takes more time. It seems to temporarily affect production, but in the long run, it is to better promote production. On the other hand, while putting the word "good" first, we must also try to be fast. Putting the word "good" first does not mean "slow work produces fine work," but to seek fast in good, seek more in good, and seek saving in good. More, faster, better, and more economical are a unity of contradictions. Only by comprehensively implementing the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical can we meet the needs of production. To achieve fast in good, we have made a series of improvements in the operation of overhaul work: we changed the winding process of the motor from manual to mechanized, which doubled the efficiency; we used to dry the motor with an electric furnace, but now we use a transformer, which increased the efficiency by three to four times; we also made a small hoist to lift large parts of the rock-loading machine and motors, etc. Recently, we also trial-produced a flexible shaft polishing machine to process the surface of the machine. These improvements have reduced heavy physical labor and accelerated the overhaul speed.

    Overhaul and Innovation

    Since being responsible for the overhaul of the rock-loading machine, I and my comrades have successively made more than 20 improvements to the walking, lifting, rotating, and electrical parts of the rock-loading machine, some of which have been adopted by the rock-loading machine manufacturing plant. Some comrades said: "Overhaul work is just disassembling and repairing. It is considered fulfilling the responsibility to repair the machine." Some say that innovation is the business of the manufacturing department. Indeed, under normal circumstances, the leaders only require us to overhaul the machine according to the factory standard. However, I think that overhauling the rock-loading machine is for production. To make the rock-loading machine better serve production, we cannot be satisfied with meeting the factory standard, but we must improve the overhaul quality with an extremely responsible and meticulous attitude, and further strengthen the structure of the rock-loading machine through overhaul to make it more adaptable to the needs of production. On the other hand, production is constantly developing, and the rock-loading machine should also be constantly improved. If the rock-loading machine is not improved accordingly when the tunneling footage is constantly increased, it will hinder the development of production. In the past, the accident of breaking the motor rotor shaft often occurred. If the rock-loading machine breaks the shaft, it is like a person breaking a leg. If the rock-loading machine does not move, the gangue cannot be loaded, and 20 or 30 people at the workface will be idle. Just removing the broken motor will take skilled workers three or four hours. After replacing the new shaft of the same size, the diameter of the shaft head has not changed, and the accident of breaking the shaft still cannot be avoided. If such problems are not completely solved, it will seriously affect production and cause great losses to the country. We are the masters of the country. We cannot ignore such problems because we are overhaul workers and not the manufacturing department. Therefore, we changed the diameter of the shaft head from 36 cm to 46 cm so that it can withstand greater torque. After this change, the problem was fundamentally solved. This makes me realize that overhaul and innovation are both contradictory and unified. In overhaul work, we must proceed from the needs of production and innovate the structure of the machine to better complete the overhaul task and make the machine better serve production. Conversely, if we do not reform the diameter of the shaft head, the accident of breaking the shaft will continue to occur, and we will only follow behind and replace it endlessly, which will affect production and make the overhaul work passive. It seems that innovation is more troublesome than simple overhaul, but in the long run, it fundamentally solves the problem and is more convenient. Therefore, we cannot limit our work to the overhaul circle. We must not only repair the damaged parts of the machine, but also reform the parts of the machine that do not meet the needs of production. Only by jumping out of the overhaul circle and daring to revolutionize the machine can this work become an active and creative work.

    Learning and Creation

    Whether it is doing overhaul or innovation, we must humbly learn from the advanced experience of brother factories and mines and surrounding comrades to make ourselves take fewer detours and continue to move forward. Projects such as the reform of the shape of the rock-loading machine bucket, the shortening of the rock-loading machine rear buffer, and the drying of the motor with a transformer have been improved after learning from the experience of brother units. However, no matter what you learn, you must proceed from reality, think from the perspective of production needs and ease of use, and never copy blindly. Take the cover plate on the rock-loading machine control box as an example. It weighs more than 100 kilograms. When the underground driver disassembles and assembles it, several people carry it back and forth, which is very strenuous. Since 1964, I have wanted to make it lighter, but I have not thought of any good way. Some comrades said, "Can the cover plate be made thinner? Wouldn't the weight be lighter?" However, I considered that the structure of the rock-loading machine requires firmness and robustness. What if the cover plate is too thin and cannot withstand the impact force during rock loading? The rock-loading machine is close to the workface. What if a stone falls and breaks the cover plate during blasting? Besides, the underground workface is narrow. What if the cover plate is squeezed and deformed? Due to these considerations, it has been delayed for a long time, but it is always a concern. Later, I saw that the rear trough help of the transportation car was hinged, and the middle was connected with flat iron, which could be opened and closed freely, and the operation was also very light. I thought, can the connection between the control box cover and the lower part of the control box also be changed to a hinge? I discussed it with the veteran workers and technicians. They all agreed and suggested using round iron to connect, because round iron is stronger than flat iron. In this way, this "long-standing and difficult" problem was solved. This makes me deeply realize that to do a good job in overhaul or technical innovation, we must learn from many aspects. We cannot keep our eyes on a rock-loading machine. We must pay attention to learning the structure and advantages of other machines to inspire and enrich ourselves. However, when learning, we must combine the use characteristics of the rock-loading machine and the needs of production to creatively study and apply. In this way, we can turn what we have learned into our own useful things. Chairman Mao taught us that when learning from other people's experience, we must "absorb those things that are useful, reject those things that are useless, and add those things that are unique to ourselves." When we learn from other people's experience, we must test what we have learned in practice and use our brains to think about what is applicable and what is not applicable. If it is applicable, we will absorb it to enrich ourselves. If it is not applicable, we will further think of ways to reform it. In this way, there is creation in learning and learning in creation, and the combination of learning and creation can achieve practical results and continuously improve the overhaul quality and technical level.

    Protagonist and Supporting Role

    Overhaul work is to serve production. Our mine calls the electromechanical overhaul department the auxiliary department, which means to cooperate with production. People regard coal miners as protagonists and electromechanical overhaul workers as supporting roles. We believe that this refers to the work undertaken under certain conditions. For coal production, coal miners are protagonists and electromechanical overhaul workers are supporting roles. However, when the rock-loading machine is broken and cannot load rocks, the problem of the rock-loading machine becomes the main contradiction for tunnel driving, and the overhaul worker becomes the main aspect of the contradiction. At this time, 20 or 30 workers at the workface are looking at the overhaul worker. If the rock-loading machine is not repaired in time, it will seriously affect the footage. At this critical moment, our overhaul workers become the protagonists, which requires us to give full play to our subjective initiative and repair the machine as soon as possible to solve the contradiction between the rock-loading machine and production. Last year, when our mine was setting a new record of 300 meters per month, the comrades in our overhaul team took turns going down the well to replace shifts. To avoid affecting rock loading, we used the interval time of rock loading to overhaul the machine. We often send spare parts and accessories to the well. If the parts are broken, the overhaul worker in the well can replace them at any time. Under this circumstance, the rock-loading machine runs safely, and the footage increases. If the rock-loading machine breaks down, 300 meters may not be completed. Doing a good job in overhaul will promote production, otherwise, it will affect production. Some comrades think that overhaul work is serving people and is not as glorious as being a coal miner or a tunnel driver. This is only seeing the small world of wrenches and pliers in isolation and not seeing the importance of overhaul work. The quality of overhaul work directly affects the speed of footage and coal output. Dismantling and repairing may seem small and trivial, but in fact, it is of great significance. If the rock-loading machine breaks down, the tunnel driving progress will not be able to go up, and the coal mining workface will not be able to be prepared, which will result in less coal production and affect the completion of the national construction plan. We must be in the overhaul team and have our eyes on the whole of China. We must see that every meter we advance and every ton of coal we produce is adding a brick and tile to the construction of the socialist building and is supporting the struggle of the revolutionary people all over the world. The task of our overhaul work is to extend the life of the machine and improve the performance of the machine with our overhaul so that the existing equipment can play the greatest role in promoting production and improving production. We are both supporting roles and protagonists.

    In recent years, thanks to the study of Chairman Mao's works, I have explored some regularities in overhaul work, but this is only the beginning. Compared with the requirements of the Party and the needs of work, it is still far behind. Especially this year, after our team has taken on the overhaul work of all the above-ground and underground, mobile equipment and idle equipment in the entire mine, the task has become even more arduous. In the future, I must study Chairman Mao's books well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, do a good job in overhaul, and contribute my strength to China's socialist construction.

    我摸到了检修工作的一些规律
    京西矿务局长沟峪煤矿机电设备检修班班长　王永贵
    编者按　对立统一的规律，是唯物辩证法的核心。随着活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动广泛深入地发展，这个唯物辩证法的核心，正在为越来越多的工农兵群众所掌握，在改造人们的主观世界、进而改造客观世界的实践中，发挥越来越大的作用。这里发表的几位工人同志的文章，又一次地证明了这一点。
    毛泽东同志说：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”事实也正是这样。王永贵同志正确地认识和处理了检修工作中的被动和主动、好和快、主角和配角等一系列的相互关系，就大大地改进了自己的工作；哈尔滨机联机械厂的一些同志学习和运用了辩证法，就在平凡的工作中做出了出色的成绩。
    被动和主动
    我以前是个装岩司机，一九六一年开始检修装岩机，开始当检修工时，没有掌握住检修工作的规律，真是“狗咬刺猬不知从那儿下嘴”。几台装岩机经常出毛病，我就整天忙着应付。有时刚刚抢修完装岩机，人还没有走出井口，井口的电话就等着让我回去了。几千米的大巷，我就来回折腾，夜里睡觉连工作服也不敢脱。由于检修质量不好，影响了掘进进尺，掌子面工人说什么的都有。有的说：“这那儿是装岩机，是挡道机、障碍机。”工作很被动，自己也很苦恼。后来学习了毛主席著作，认识到机器老是修不好，就是因为我没有掌握装岩机的性能和它的运动规律。于是，我一方面阅读技术书籍，一方面在检修过程中研究造成机器损坏的原因。装岩机与别的机器有什么不同？天长日久，我逐渐发现：装岩机每天在井下运行装岩，不断地“前进”和“后退”，把石头装进铲斗，又扣入矿车，日日夜夜同千百吨石头碰撞。这种前进与后退的冲击力和不断的震动，使装岩机的零件很容易松动、损坏。要检修好装岩机，必须掌握装岩机这种特殊的运动形式，这就是装岩机区别于其它固定设备（如压风机、水泵、绞车等）的特殊性，装岩机的一切故障、磨损，绝大多数是由此引起的。掌握了装岩机的这个特点，在检修工作上就抓住了主要矛盾。要做好装岩机的检修工作，必须扭转过去那种头痛医头、脚痛医脚的做法，从根本上加固装岩机各个部件，使它延长寿命，牢固耐用。就拿装岩机行走部的减速箱漏油问题来说，开始我以为是隔垫纸太薄了，就加了一层，又刷上一层铅油，还是照样漏油。我再检查，又发现螺丝松动，我把螺丝打了孔，用铅丝穿起来固定住，可是漏油问题还未解决。我怀疑机器结构不好，但是，为什么提升部的减速箱不漏油呢？我把两种减速箱作了比较，原来提升部减速箱受震动小，行走部减速箱受震动大，因此造成螺丝松动，盖板不严，这才是漏油的主要原因。我们就在减速箱底部焊上了一块托铁，一方面加固了减速箱，一方面减小了减速箱受到的冲击力。根据同样的道理，又在减速箱上面焊了块压铁，防止盖板松动错位，经过这次改进，基本上解决了行走部减速箱漏油的问题。这说明要做好装岩机的检修工作，必须掌握装岩机这种机器运转的特殊规律，并且从这个特殊规律出发去考虑装岩机的一切问题。这样做以后，装岩机坏的少了，机器寿命延长了，我的工作也逐渐走上了正轨。毛主席教导我们：“不论做什么事，不懂得那件事的情形，它的性质，它和它以外的事情的关联，就不知道那件事的规律，就不知道如何去做，就不能做好那件事。”为什么我的工作过去一直被动，现在比较主动了呢？就是因为我过去不懂得装岩机的性质，更不懂得它和大石头的联系，人被机器制住了。而在我摸透了机器的脾气，降伏了机器以后，机器就乖乖地听人使唤，为生产服务了。我的工作也就从被动转化为主动了。
    好和快
    要使装岩机的检修工作适应生产需要，就要保证检修质量好、速度快。实现好和快的一个重要关键是必须准备足够的备品配件。装岩机上那些配件容易损坏，消耗量大，就要多准备些，检修时就不会因为缺少某个配件而用其它不合格的配件代替，影响质量；也不会因为等待加工某个配件而停工，影响检修速度。过去我们曾经吃过备品配件不足的苦头。有一次鼓轮上的轴瓦坏了，没有备品，只好临时叫车工去旋，可是又怕影响生产，装岩机就带病运行，结果把瓦件螺丝折断了，整个机器只好出井修理。有时候机器很长时间修不出来，也是因为没有备品。我们吃一堑就长一智，从此以后，每次机器出井，什么地方损坏，需要什么配件，都一一记录下来，建立了检修卡片，掌握了每台装岩机的病历。这样，就逐渐摸到了规律，知道了那些配件易坏，那些配件不易坏。有了充足的备品配件，有备无患，就为又好又快地完成检修任务创造了条件。
    检修工作的任务，就是要把坏的机器修理好，保证质量是第一条。但是在检修时往往井下一催，我们就着了急，思想上就片面地只顾快，忽视好。有的同志对零件就不仔细选择了，说什么“差一寸，凑合使”。可是客观规律是不能凭我们主观愿望去凑合的，忽视质量的结果，不是连续发生新故障，就是坏得更快。有一次因为检修图快，忘记给减速箱中的齿轮注油，装岩机下井后走到半路就不动了。五、六吨的大家伙，拉也拉不出来，进也进不去。仔细一检查，是因为没注油，齿轮中的铜套和轴烧住了，又从井下运到井上返修，这一折腾，就是两天两夜。本来是图快，但是片面求快、忙中出乱，粗枝大叶，造成事故，结果反而更慢了。所以，在检修工作中，要全面考虑快和好的关系。首先要做到好字当头，只有好中求多才能真正多，好中求快才能真正快，好中求省才能真正省。在检修工作中要以极端负责的精神坚持质量第一，越是催得紧，越要细心检查，越要严字当头，一丝不苟。宁可叫机器晚下井一个钟头，也不要忙中出错，造成更大的返工和浪费。为了保证检修质量，有时候需要花较多的时间，看起来好象暂时影响了生产，但是从长远看，却是为了更好地促进生产。另一方面，在好字当头的同时，还要尽量争取快。好字当头决不是要“慢工出细活”，而是要在好中求快，好中求多，好中求省，多快好省是矛盾的统一。只有全面地贯彻多快好省的方针，才能满足生产的需要。为了做到好中求快，我们在检修工作的操作上作了一系列改进：把电动机的缠线工序由手工改为机械化，效率提高一倍；原来用电炉子干燥电动机，现在改用变压器，提高效率三、四倍；又制成一台小型起吊机，起吊装岩机的大型部件和电动机等，最近还试制成一台软轴磨光机，来加工机械的表面。这些改进都减轻了笨重的体力劳动，加快了检修速度。
    检修和革新
    自从负责装岩机检修工作以来，我和同志们一起，先后对装岩机的行走、提升、回转、电气四个部分作了二十多项改进，其中有些项目已经为装岩机制造厂采纳。有的同志说：“检修工作就是拆拆修修，修好了机器就算尽到了责任。”有的说搞革新是制造部门的事。的确，在一般情况下，领导只要求我们按出厂标准检修机器。但是我想，检修装岩机是为了生产，要使装岩机更好地为生产服务，就不能满足于达到出厂标准，而是要以极端负责、精益求精的态度提高检修质量，通过检修进一步加固装岩机的结构，使它更适应生产的需要，另一方面，生产是不断发展的，对装岩机也应当不断的改进。在掘进进尺不断提高的情况下，装岩机如果不作相应的改进，就会阻碍生产的发展。过去经常发生电动机转子轴断轴事故，装岩机一断轴就好象人折了腿，装岩机一不动，矸石装不出来，工作面二、三十人就窝工，就是光把这坏了的电动机拆出来，熟练工人也得干三、四个小时。换上同样大小的新轴以后，轴头直径未变，断轴事故仍然不能避免。象这样的问题不彻底解决，就要严重影响生产，给国家造成很大损失。我们是国家的主人，对这样的问题，不能因为我们是检修工，不是制造部门，就眼看着不管。于是，我们把轴头直径由三十六厘米改为四十六厘米，使它能够承受较大的扭力，这样改了以后，从根本上解决了问题。这使我体会到：检修和革新也是既矛盾又统一的。在检修工作中一定要从生产的需要出发，对机器的结构进行革新，才能更好地完成检修任务，使机器更好地为生产服务。反之，我们如果不改革轴头的直径，断轴事故也就会不断发生，我们就只有跟在后面无休止地更换，既影响生产，检修工作也会被动。看起来，搞革新是要比单纯的检修费事、麻烦，但是从长远看，却是从根本上解决问题，是更加省事了。所以，我们不能把我们的工作局限在检修的圈子里，我们不仅要修好机器损坏的部分，还要改革掉机器不适合生产需要的部分。做检修工作的，只有跳出检修的圈子，敢于革机器的命，才能使这项工作变成一项积极的、有创造性的工作。
    学习和创造
    不论是搞检修还是搞革新，都得虚心学习兄弟厂矿和周围同志的先进经验，才能使自己少走弯路，不断前进。象装岩机铲斗形状的改革、装岩机后缓冲器的缩短、用变压器干燥电动机等项目，都是学习了兄弟单位的经验以后改进的。但是，不论学习什么，都还要从实际出发，从生产需要和使用方便着想，千万不能照葫芦画瓢，生搬硬套。就拿装岩机操作箱上的盖板来说，重一百多斤，井下司机在拆装时几个人抬来抬去，挺费劲。从一九六四年起，我就想把它改轻巧一些，但是一直没有想到什么好办法。有的同志说是不是可以把盖板改薄一些，份量不就轻了吗？可是，我考虑装岩机的结构要求结实、坚固，盖板要是薄了，经不起装岩时的冲击力怎么办？装岩机离工作面近，要是放炮时掉一块石头砸坏了盖板怎么办？再说井下工作面面积狭窄，如果把盖板挤变形怎么办？由于这种种考虑就拖了很长时间，但总是一桩心事。后来我看到运输汽车的后槽帮是合页的，中间用扁铁联接，可以自由开关，操作起来也很轻便。我想，操作箱盖板与操作箱下部联接的地方是不是也可以改成合页？我就同老工人、技术员商量，他们同声赞成，并提出用圆铁联接，因为圆铁比扁铁结实。就这样解决了这个“老大难”的问题。这使我深深地体会到，要做好检修工作或搞好技术革新，必须多方面学习，不能把眼光停留在一台装岩机上，要注意学习别的机器的结构和优点，来启发和充实自己。但是学习时一定要结合装岩机的使用特点和生产需要来活学活用，这样才能把学到的东西变成自己的有用的东西。毛主席教导我们在学习别人经验的时候，要“吸收那些用得着的东西，拒绝那些用不着的东西，增加那些自己所特有的东西。”我们学习别人的经验时，自己必须把学到的东西拿到实践中去检验，并且用脑子想一想，什么是适用的，什么是不适用的，适用的就吸取过来充实自己，不适用的就进一步想办法改革它。这样学中有创，创中有学，学创结合，才能收到实效，不断提高检修质量和技术水平。
    主角和配角
    检修工作是为生产服务的，我们矿把机电检修部门叫做辅助部门，意思是配合生产的。人们把采掘工人看做是主角，机电检修工人是配角。我们认为：这是指一定条件下所担负的工作来说的。对于生产煤炭来说，采煤工人是主角，机电检修工人是配角。但是，当装岩机坏了，不能装岩的时候，对于巷道掘进来说，装岩机的问题就成了主要矛盾，检修工就成了矛盾的主要方面，这时候，掌子面二、三十个工人都瞧着检修工，要是不及时修好装岩机，就严重影响进尺。在这个节骨眼上，我们检修工就成了主角，就要求我们充分发挥人的主观能动性，尽快的修好机器，来解决装岩机和生产的矛盾。去年，我们矿上搞月进三百米的新纪录的时候，我们检修班的同志轮流下井顶班，为了不影响装岩，我们都是利用装岩间隙时间来检修机器。我们经常把备品、配件送到井下，零件坏了，井下检修工可随时配上。在这种情况下，装岩机安全运转，进尺就上升，装岩机出了故障，三百米就可能完不成。检修工作做好了，就促进生产，否则，就影响生产。有些同志认为检修工作是侍候人，没有当采煤工、掘进工光彩，这是孤立地只看到搬子、钳子的小天地，没有看到检修工作的重要性，检修工作做得好坏，直接影响进尺速度和煤炭产量，拆拆修修改改看来细小琐碎，实际上意义很大。装岩机出了故障，掘进进度上不去，采煤工作面就准备不出来，就要少出煤，就要影响国家建设计划的完成。我们必须身在检修班，眼看全中国。要看到我们多进一米尺，多出一吨煤，都是为建设社会主义大厦增添了一砖一瓦，都是对全世界革命人民斗争的支持。我们检修工作的任务就是用我们的检修延长机器的寿命，改进机器的性能，使现有设备发挥最大的作用，来促进生产，提高生产。我们既是配角，也是主角。
    近几年来，由于学习了毛主席著作，使我在检修工作上摸索到一些规律，但是这仅仅是开始，与党的要求、工作的需要相比，还相差太远。特别是今年我们班担负了全矿井上井下、流动设备和闲置设备的检修工作以后，任务就更加艰巨了。今后我一定要好好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做好检修工作，为我国社会主义建设贡献自己的力量。
