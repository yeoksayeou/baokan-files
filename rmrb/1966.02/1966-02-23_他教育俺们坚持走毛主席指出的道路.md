　　He Taught Us to Persist in Following the Path Pointed Out by Chairman Mao
　　Party Branch Secretary of Shuangyangshu Brigade, Hongmiao Commune, Lankao County, Wang Faxiang
    After 1961, Shuangyangshu Brigade suffered from several years of natural disasters in a row. In particular, in 1963, the crops were basically wiped out, and the brigade's agricultural production fell to the lowest level in history. Coupled with the lack of livestock and farm implements, there were many difficulties. In the autumn of that year, when it came time to plant wheat, because there were few livestock, the land could not be plowed, and there were no seeds to plant after plowing, it seemed that production would suffer. At this critical juncture, the Party branch, with this difficult problem in mind, earnestly studied Chairman Mao's works and found a broad road in Chairman Mao's works to rely on the strength of the collective economy, to rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, to overcome difficulties, and to transform from poverty to affluence. The road became clear, and confidence also increased. Then, the Party branch raised the question of "relying on state relief or relying on the collective in the face of difficulties," mobilizing everyone to discuss it. Many poor and lower-middle peasants said: We haven't contributed much to the country, and we're already feeling bad enough; we must never hold the country back again. If we don't have livestock, we have plenty of people, and we can organize manpower to pull plows and seed drills to plant wheat. To solve the problem of insufficient production funds, the entire brigade raised 1,800 yuan in funds plus in-kind contributions. Cheng Jinglun, a poor peasant commune member of the Third Production Team, said: "Although I only have twenty yuan, I will lend it to the team first to solve the team's difficulties. This is my sincere devotion to the collective." Four poor peasant households in the Third Team contributed 700 jin of wheat from their reserves to the team to solve the seed shortage. Because they relied on the collective and on the poor and lower-middle peasants, the difficult problems were quickly resolved. The entire team bought seven head of livestock and raised more than 1,500 jin of seeds on their own. With animal power plus manpower, they quickly completed the wheat planting task and achieved victory in the fight against the disaster. Comrade Jiao Yulu said that we followed the path pointed out by Chairman Mao and we are going in the right direction, and he promoted the "Shuangyangshu road" everywhere.
    Since the "Shuangyangshu road" became famous, Comrade Jiao Yulu came to our brigade several times, educating us to insist on continuing down this road. In all our work, we are advancing along this broad socialist road.
    In the spring of 1964, in carrying out sideline production activities, a struggle between two roads appeared, and some people wanted to engage in individual farming. To occupy the sideline production position, our Party branch mobilized everyone to discuss it. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said: "In agriculture, we relied on the collective economy to overcome difficulties. In sideline production, we must also rely on the collective to achieve common prosperity." Through discussion, the team's sideline production was brought into the collective orbit. But when engaging in sideline production, the team didn't have enough funds for a while. What should we do? Find the poor and lower-middle peasants to give ideas and find solutions. Poor peasant commune member Wu Shaoyang said: "I am willing to contribute 60 yuan to the team." Under the leadership of the poor and lower-middle peasants, a high tide of investment in sideline production was quickly set off. The five production teams in Shuangyangshu Village alone invested 1,140 yuan. Collective sideline production quickly got underway. In five months, the sideline income was more than 4,000 yuan, which repaid the investment of the commune members, bought two rubber-wheeled carts, and also bought 2,000 jin of grain for the commune members.
    After the wheat harvest in 1965, it did not rain for fifty consecutive days. In the activity of fighting drought and rushing to plant late autumn crops, each team encountered the problem of a shortage of sweet potato seedlings, with the entire brigade short more than 200 mu of seedlings. Faced with this problem, we still adopted the approach of relying on the collective and relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants to find a solution. The poor and lower-middle peasants expressed that they would rather not plant sweet potatoes on their private plots, but first ensure that the collective's sweet potatoes were planted. Poor peasant commune member Wu Chunyang said: "If the big river has no water, the small rivers will dry up. I won't plant sweet potatoes on my private plot." After saying this, he went home to mobilize his family, young and old, to contribute all 19,000 of their sweet potato seedlings to the team. Under the leadership of the Party and Youth League cadres and the poor and lower-middle peasants, the commune members of the entire brigade contributed more than 79,000 sweet potato seedlings, thus solving the seedling shortage problem, completing the sweet potato planting task in a timely manner, and obtaining a good harvest in the autumn. At the same time, the sweet potatoes on the commune members' private plots were also planted with the team's and individuals' second-crop seedlings.
    In the past few years, we have followed this road, overcome disasters, and developed production.
    Just as we were implementing the spirit of the county Party committee's four-level cadre meeting and organizing a high tide of agricultural production, we also studied the heroic deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, which greatly inspired us. Although we have now changed from a grain-deficient team to a grain-surplus team, we still have to work hard to build high-yielding farmland with guaranteed harvests despite drought or flood, and bravely advance on the socialist road!

　　他教育俺们坚持走毛主席指出的道路
　　兰考县红庙公社双杨树大队党支部书记　王发祥
    双杨树大队，一九六一年以后，连续遭受了几年的自然灾害，特别是一九六三年农作物基本绝收，全大队农业生产下降到历史上最低水平。加上牲口少，农具缺，困难重重。这年秋天，到了种麦季节，因为牲口少，地犁不过来，犁起来又没有种子，眼看生产要受损失。就在这个关头，党支部带着这个困难问题认真学习了毛主席著作，在毛主席著作里找到了一条依靠集体经济力量，依靠贫农下中农，战胜困难，由穷变富的康庄大道。道路明确了，信心也高了。接着党支部又提出“有了困难是依靠国家救济还是依靠集体”问题，发动大家讨论，不少贫农下中农都说：咱们对国家没啥贡献，就够难过了，决不能再拉国家的后腿。没牲口咱有的是人，可以组织人力拉犁拉耧种麦。为解决生产资金不足问题，全大队自筹资金加上物资折款共有一千八百多元。第三生产队贫农社员程景伦说：“虽然我只有二十块钱，也要借给队里先解决队里的困难，这是我对集体的一片心意。”第三队有四户贫农将储备的七百斤麦子，投到队里解决缺种困难。因为依靠集体，依靠贫农下中农，困难问题很快得到解决。全队买了七头牲口，又自筹了一千五百多斤种子，畜力加人力，很快完成了种麦任务，取得了抗灾斗争的胜利。焦裕禄同志说，俺们按着毛主席指出的道路走，走得对，到处宣传“双杨树的道路”。
    自从“双杨树道路”出名以后，焦裕禄同志曾几次来到俺们大队，教育我们要坚持将这条道路走下去。我们在各项工作中都是沿着这条社会主义大路前进的。
    一九六四年春，我们在开展副业生产活动中，出现了两条道路的斗争，有的人想搞单干。为占领副业阵地，我们党支部发动大家讨论。广大贫农下中农说：“搞农业我们靠集体经济战胜了困难，搞副业也必须依靠集体，才能达到共同富裕。”通过讨论，使队里的副业生产纳入了集体轨道。但是搞副业，队里一时又没资金，怎么办？找贫农下中农出主意，想办法。贫农社员吴少扬说：“我自愿投到队里六十元。”在贫农下中农的带动下，很快掀起了投资搞副业的高潮。仅双杨树村五个生产队就投资一千一百四十元。集体副业很快搞起来了。五个月的时间，副业收入四千多元，归还了社员们的投资，又买了两辆胶轮马车，还给社员买来粮食两千斤。
    一九六五年麦收后，一连五十天没有下雨，在抗旱抢种晚秋作物的活动中，各队都出现了缺红薯苗的问题，全大队缺苗二百多亩。面对着这个问题，我们仍然采取了依靠集体，依靠贫农下中农想法解决。贫农下中农纷纷表示宁愿自留地的红薯不栽，也要保证集体的红薯先种上。贫农社员吴春扬说：“大河没水小河干，我自留地的红薯不栽了。”说罢就回家动员老少把自己的一万九千棵红薯苗全部投到队里。在党、团干部和贫农下中农的带动下，全大队社员共投红薯苗七万九千多棵，从而解决了缺苗问题，适时完成了红薯的栽种任务，秋季获得了好收成。同时，社员自留地的红薯也都用队里的和个人的二茬秧子栽上了。
    几年来，我们沿着这条道路，战胜了灾害，发展了生产。
    正当我们贯彻县委四级干部会议精神，组织农业生产高潮时，我们又学习了焦裕禄同志的英雄事迹，受到了很大的激励。虽然现在我们已由缺粮队变为余粮队了，我们还要大干一场，搞好旱涝保收的稳产高产农田，在社会主义的大道上奋勇前进！
