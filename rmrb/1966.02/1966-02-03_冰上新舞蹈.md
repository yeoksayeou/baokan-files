    New Ice Dances
    Speaking of figure skating, those familiar with the sport often think of people skating prescribed figures on the ice, or jumping, spinning, and performing some simple dance moves. However, the 1966 National Speed Skating Championships, currently being held in Jilin City, has featured new ice dances that have been particularly well-received.
    Accompanied by the melodious song, "Heroic figures, five-foot spears, the dawn illuminates the drill ground...", a militia team composed of eight female figure skaters, holding long spears, marched in formation, high-spirited and full of vigor, rapidly gliding on the crystal-clear ice. The performance of the ice-based group dance "Female Militia" began.
    The female militia members sometimes shot, sometimes threw grenades, and sometimes engaged in bayonet practice. They cleverly combined dance moves with the unique "balance" and "jump three" movements in figure skating, forming a vivid picture of military training on ice. It effectively reflected the heroic bearing of our female militia members and their image of being ready when called upon, able to fight when they come, and victorious in battle, earning enthusiastic applause from the audience.
    Immediately following, a cavalry team dressed in white cloaks appeared on the smooth ice. They held swords in one hand and "reined" their horses with the other, galloping and gliding, instantly transforming the ice surface into a boundless prairie. Before long, the ice seemed to turn into rugged mountain roads, as the cavalrymen used a series of complex techniques from figure skating, such as rapid spins, mid-air turns, jumps, and bends, along with other dance moves, to express the cavalry's brave and tenacious spirit and their determination to defend the motherland's borders. This was the ice-based group dance "Soldiers Galloping to Defend the Border" performed by the skating team.
    When the music on the ice rink switched to the song "Liberate the South" by the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, a different scene unfolded on the ice. The figure skaters participating in the ice-based group dance "Liberate the South" wore Vietnamese national costumes and vividly depicted the story of a guerrilla team in South Vietnam engaging in bloody battles with the enemy and liberating their hometowns through various jumps and other movements. This ice dance performance, expressing the Vietnamese people's certain victory and the American imperialists' inevitable defeat, once again ignited the audience's applause.
    The ice-based group dance "Guerrilla Fighters," based on the "Song of the Guerrilla Fighters," also made good use of and highlighted the characteristics and unique skills of figure skating, making the image of the guerrilla fighters even more realistic.
    These four group dances, created and performed by the figure skating teams of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, allowed people to see the vast potential of figure skating performance. In order to better serve the revolutionary cause and be enjoyed by workers, peasants, and soldiers, the two figure skating teams have made many reforms in the content, costumes, and accompaniment of figure skating performances in recent years. Now, athletes wear beautiful and generous sportswear during individual competitions or performances, and all use Chinese music as accompaniment.
    In order to better represent real life, the athletes once went deep into the army, practicing martial arts alongside the soldiers. They also performed these dances for soldiers, workers, and students, and made many revisions based on the opinions of the masses.

    冰上新舞蹈
    提起花样滑冰，熟悉这项运动的人往往会想到人们在冰上滑一些规定图形或者跳跃、旋转，以及滑一些简单的舞蹈动作等。可是，连日来，正在吉林市举行的一九六六年全国速度滑冰锦标赛，出现了新的冰上舞蹈，受到人们的特别欢迎。
    伴随着“飒爽英姿五尺枪，曙光初照演兵场，……”的悦耳的歌声，一支由八名女花样滑冰运动员组成的民兵队伍，手持长枪，列队雄赳赳气昂昂地急速滑行在晶莹如镜的冰面上。冰上集体舞《女民兵》的表演开始了。
    女民兵们一会射击，一会投弹，一会又刺杀起来。她们把舞蹈动作和花样滑冰运动中特有的“平衡”、“跳三字”等动作巧妙地结合起来，构成了一幅冰上练武的生动图画，较好地反映了我国女民兵的飒爽英姿和召之即来，来之能战，战之能胜的英雄形象，获得观众热烈的掌声。
    紧接着，一支身着白色斗篷的骑兵队伍立即出现在平滑的冰面上。他们一手持刀，一手“勒马”，驰骋滑行，冰面顿时好象变成了一望无际的草原。不一会，冰面又好象变成了崎岖的山道，骑兵们用花样滑冰中的急速旋转、空中转身、跳跃飞腾、弯身旋转等一系列比较复杂的技巧和其他一些舞蹈动作，把骑兵勇敢顽强的精神和保卫祖国边疆的决心表现了出来。这是滑冰队表演的冰上集体舞蹈《战士纵马守边疆》。
    当冰场上的音乐转到越南南方民族解放阵线之歌《解放南方》的时候，冰场上出现了另一番景象。参加冰上集体舞蹈《解放南方》表演的花样滑冰运动员们，身穿越南民族服装，通过各种跳跃和其他动作，生动地表现了越南南方一支游击队同敌人展开浴血苦战，并且解放自己家乡的经过。这场表现越南人民必胜、美帝必败的冰上舞蹈表演，又一次激起了观众的掌声。
    根据《游击队员之歌》编创的冰上集体舞蹈《游击队员》，也由于较好地利用和发挥了花样滑冰的特点和独有的技巧，使游击队员的形象更为逼真。
    吉林和黑龙江两省的花样滑冰队创编和表演的这四个集体舞蹈，使人们看到了花样滑冰表演的广阔天地。为了使花样滑冰表演更好地为革命事业服务，为工农兵所喜闻乐见，这两个花样滑冰队近年来在花样滑冰表演的内容、服装、伴奏等方面进行了不少改革。现在，运动员们在个人比赛或表演时，穿着都是美观、大方的运动服装，全部采用中国音乐伴奏。
    为了较好地表现现实生活，运动员们曾经深入部队，同战士们一起摸爬滚打练武。他们还把这些舞蹈表演给战士、工人、学生看，并根据群众的意见进行了多次修改。
