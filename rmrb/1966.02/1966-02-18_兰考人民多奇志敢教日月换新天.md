Edition: 1

    In March 1964, when the struggle of the people of Lankao County, Henan Province, to eliminate the "three harms" was entering its climax, Comrade Jiao Yulu, while seriously ill, wanted to start writing an article entitled "The People of Lankao Have Lofty Aspirations, Daring to Command the Sun and Moon to Change the Sky." Although he himself did not complete this article, the people of Lankao, under his education and encouragement, have initially turned his vision into reality with practical actions. Since 1963, the 360,000 people of Lankao County have waged a resolute struggle against the three harms in accordance with the first plan for eliminating and controlling waterlogging, sandstorms, and alkaline soil, which was advocated and formulated by Comrade Jiao Yulu. By 1965, the tasks stipulated in the plan had been basically completed. In that year, this old disaster-stricken county, which historically lacked grain, achieved self-sufficiency in grain and sold more than 8 million jin of peanuts and hundreds of thousands of jin of ginned cotton to the state. More importantly, the mental outlook of the broad masses of cadres and people in Lankao County has undergone profound changes. Through their own practice, they firmly believe that the path of hard work and self-reliance pointed out by the Party is the most reliable path to change the world and build a new socialist countryside. Now, their fighting spirit is even more vigorous, and they are advancing towards the goal of completely changing the face of Lankao in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    Controlling Sandstorms
    Lankao County is located in the sand area of the old Yellow River course, and sandstorms are one of the "three harms" of this county. In general years, sandstorms damage tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of mu of crops every year. In the winter of 1962 and the spring of the following year, there were more than 70 strong winds, and flying sand killed 250,000 mu of crops. In the same period last year, there were also more than 70 strong winds. During the drought in May and June, the level 6 or 7 strong winds blew down a house at the county tractor station. However, because the young trees planted by the people of the county in 190,000 mu of sandy area began to play a role in fixing the sand, and the 15,000 mu of sand dunes that endangered crops have been covered with silt, sandstorms no longer harmed crops. Previously, in Lankao, after a night of sandstorms, it was difficult to see the patterns on the quilt the next morning. Now, this phenomenon is gone.
    Draining Waterlogging
    Last year, following the severe drought in May and June, 172.8 millimeters of rain fell continuously in one week, but no disaster occurred. In previous years, as long as Lankao had continuous rainfall of 150 to 200 millimeters, 200,000 mu of farmland would be affected by disasters, and 100,000 mu would have no harvest. Last year, because the 220,000 mu of low-lying land had 13 backbone drainage rivers and more than 1,000 small branch rivers, together with some road ditches and field furrows, formed a huge drainage network in the county, the farmland was not affected by disasters. Three years ago, Zhang Junmu Commune was often a place where boats could sail on flat ground during the flood season. Last autumn, despite the heavy rain, this commune not only did not suffer from disasters, but also increased its total grain output by more than three times compared with 1963.
    Treating Alkaline Land
    In previous years, a part of saline-alkali land often had no harvest after planting. In these three years, the members of the people's communes have worked hard, practically, and skillfully, using various methods such as deep plowing of the land, covering alkali with sand, and building terraced fields, to transform nearly half of the saline-alkali land into farmland that can be normally cultivated. Large areas of secondary saline-alkali land have also been greatly reduced in salinity through intensive cultivation, careful work, and increased fertilization. Last year, the 50,000 mu of sorghum planted on alkaline land in the county yielded an average of about 300 jin per mu, with some reaching 400 jin. A production team in the Huangkou Brigade of the Guyang Commune obtained a high yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu by planting cotton on alkaline land. The Mengzhai No. 13 Production Team of the Yifeng Commune harvested good cotton on severely alkaline land where no crops had been harvested before. The team averaged 33 jin of ginned cotton sold to the state per member.
    New Spirit
    This important turning point in Lankao County is the result of the people of the county following Chairman Mao's teachings, under the leadership of the Lankao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the advocacy of Comrade Jiao Yulu, carrying forward the thorough revolutionary spirit, and engaging in production and construction with a scientific attitude. For example, the members of Zhao Duolou and Dawangzhuang in Zhang Junmu Commune, in order to eradicate waterlogging, braved the heavy rain in 1964, digging in the mud and water, carrying quicksand with bed sheets and clothes, and loading river mud. After 24 days of hard work, they dug open the He Li River and eliminated the accumulated water. The waterlogging disaster that had not been resolved in this area for 300 years was finally overcome by them. Zhangzhuang Brigade of Zhaoying Commune had failed to control sand four times. Later, based on the experience of poor peasant Wei Duobin, they used silt to enclose 1,700 mu of sand dunes. Originally, they planned to complete this project in five years. But after they started working, men, women, old and young all went into battle together. They used carts and small baskets to transport mud and cover the sand, and completed it in less than three months. The Nanmenli Production Team of the Shizhuang Brigade of the Nanzhang Commune was an old alkaline nest. Because production was very difficult, some people once advocated moving this village away. However, the masses waged a hard struggle against the saline-alkali land, removing alkali more than one foot deep, and working hard for more than a year, changing the face of the land, and achieving self-sufficiency in grain with a surplus. This team originally had no task of selling grain, but the masses, in order to thank the Party's leadership, insisted on selling 1,200 jin of grain to support the state. The first time the grain was delivered to the grain station, the grain station did not accept it, and the members pushed the grain back. In order to express their feelings for the Party and the country, all the members loaded the grain into carts, baskets, and bags, and adults and children carried it on their shoulders and backs, flocking to the grain station together. Finally, the grain station accepted this grain.
    New Plan
    Learning from Jiao Yulu's thorough revolutionary spirit, on the basis of initial victory in eliminating and controlling the three harms, the Lankao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward a second three-to-five-year plan to further transform nature, and submitted it to the county-level four-level cadre conference held not long ago for discussion and approval. At this conference, the County Party Committee once again reported Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious revolutionary deeds. Everyone recalled that three years ago, at the same conference, when Comrade Jiao Yulu led the people to formulate the first plan for transforming nature, he had vowed, "I will not rest in peace until the face of Lankao is changed." Now, Comrade Jiao Yulu has been dead for more than a year, but everyone thought of this scene, their mood was agitated, and they increased their confidence and strength in transforming nature.
    Good Example
    The Hancun Production Team of the Chengguan Commune, the Qinzhai Brigade of the Guyang Commune, the Zhao Duolou Brigade of the Zhang Junmu Commune, and the Shuang Yangshu Brigade of the Hongmiao Commune were the four red flags advocated and established by Comrade Jiao Yulu in Lankao. "The spirit of Hancun, the determination of Qinzhai, the drive of Zhao Duolou, and the path of Shuang Yangshu" have played a huge role in the past three years of the Lankao people's struggle to change the face of nature. Now, the production of these four units has also made new developments. The land deeply plowed by the Qinzhai Brigade has increased from dozens of mu to 3,600 mu in three years, and the annual grain output has increased from 220,000 jin to 940,000 jin. Three years ago, when the Zhao Duolou Brigade formulated the first plan for transforming nature, it was planned that the total grain output would increase from 160,000 jin to 1 million jin, some people expressed doubts, but in 1965, the total grain output reached 1.06 million jin. The collective economy of the Shuang Yangshu Brigade has been further consolidated and further developed. All 350 mu of alkaline depressions in the Hancun Production Team have been built into terraced fields, and the output of grain and peanuts has increased significantly. In order to help the neighboring Li Lou Production Team to turn over and no longer eat unified sales grain, the members of this team recently took the initiative to lend Li Lou 1,400 jin of surplus grain. The people who sent the grain also helped Li Lou to formulate a specific plan for building terraced fields. This kind of class friendship aroused the enthusiasm of the people of Li Lou, and they built 70 mu of terraced fields in one fell swoop. At the four-level cadre conference held not long ago, these four brigades were still set up as red flags.
    Now, the 360,000 people of Lankao County are determined to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, take Jiao Yulu as an example, and build a new Lankao.

    “兰考人民多奇志敢教日月换新天”
    一九六四年三月间，当河南省兰考人民除“三害”斗争进入高潮的时候，焦裕禄同志在重病中想动手写一篇题为《兰考人民多奇志，敢教日月换新天》的文章。这篇文章虽然他自己没有写成，但是在他教育和鼓舞下的兰考人民，用实际行动初步把他的预想变成了现实。一九六三年以来，兰考县三十六万人民，按照焦裕禄同志倡导制定的第一个除治水、沙、碱三害的方案，同三害进行了坚决的斗争。到一九六五年，已经基本完成方案规定的任务。这一年，这个历史上缺粮的老灾县，粮食达到自给，并且卖给国家八百多万斤花生和几十万斤皮棉。更重要的是，兰考全县广大干部和人民的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，他们通过自己的实践，坚信党指出的奋发图强、自力更生的道路，是改天换地、建设社会主义新农村的最可靠的道路。现在，他们的斗志更加昂扬，正向彻底改变兰考面貌的目标有计划、有步骤地前进。
    制风沙
    兰考县地处黄河故道沙区，风沙是这个县的“三害”之一。一般年份，每年的风沙都要残害几万甚至几十万亩庄稼。一九六二年冬和次年春天，刮了七十多次大风，飞沙打死庄稼二十五万亩。去年的同一时期，也刮了七十多次大风。在五、六月间干旱期间，刮的六七级大风，把县拖拉机站的一座房子都刮倒了。但是，由于全县人民在十九万亩沙区里营造的幼林开始起了固沙作用，一万五千亩危害作物的沙丘，已经淤土封盖，风沙再没有残害庄稼。以前，在兰考，一夜风沙，天明起来，被子上的花纹都难看到。如今，这种现象没有了。
    排内涝
    去年，继五、六月大旱之后，在一星期内，连续下雨一百七十二点八毫米，但未成灾。往年，兰考只要连续降雨一百五十到二百毫米，就有二十万亩农田成灾，十万亩绝收。去年因为二十二万亩低洼地上，有了十三条骨干排水河道和一千多条小支河，配合一部分路沟和田间的墒沟，在全县构成了巨大的排涝网，农田没有受灾。三年前，一入汛期，张君墓公社常常是平地行船。去年秋天大雨，这个公社不但没有受灾，全年粮食产量还比一九六三年增加了三倍多。
    治碱地
    往年，一部分盐碱地上常常是有种无收。这三年内，各人民公社社员穷干苦干实干巧干，用深翻土地、翻沙盖碱、修筑台田等多种办法，把将近一半盐碱地改造成为可以正常耕种的农田。大片次生盐碱地，经过精耕细作，增施肥料，盐碱程度也大大减轻。去年，全县在碱地上种的五万亩高粱，平均每亩收了三百斤左右，高的达四百斤。堌阳公社黄口大队有一个生产队在碱地上种棉花，获得了亩产百斤皮棉的高产量。仪封公社孟寨十三生产队，在以前不收庄稼的重碱地上收到好棉花，全队平均每个社员卖给国家三十三斤皮棉。
    新精神
    兰考县这个重要的转折，是全县人民遵循毛主席的教导，在中共兰考县委会的领导下，根据焦裕禄同志的倡导，发扬彻底革命精神，以科学态度从事生产建设的结果。象张君墓公社赵垛楼和大王庄的社员们，为了根治涝灾，一九六四年冒着大雨，泥里挖、水里挖，用被单、衣服背流沙，装河泥，经二十四天的苦干，挖开了贺李河，排除了积水。这一带三百年来未解决的内涝灾害，终于被他们治服。爪营公社张庄大队曾经四次治沙失败。后来根据贫农魏铎彬的经验，用淤泥封闭了一千七百亩面积的沙丘。原来，他们计划要在五年内完成这个工程。但是在干起来以后，男女老少一齐上阵，他们用车子、小筐运泥盖沙，不到三个月就完成了。南彰公社氏庄大队南门里生产队是一个老碱窝，因为生产很困难，曾经有人主张把这个村子迁走。但是群众和盐碱作了艰苦的斗争，起碱一尺多深，苦干了一年多，改变了土地面貌，粮食达到了自给有余。这个队本来没有卖粮食任务，但是群众为了感谢党的领导，一定要卖一千二百斤粮食，支援国家。头一次把粮食送到粮站，粮站没有收，社员又把粮食推回来了。全体社员为了表达自己对党对国家的心意，用车子、担子、袋子装着粮食，大人小孩抬着、背着，一起涌向粮站。最后粮站收下了这份粮食。
    新方案
    学习焦裕禄的彻底革命精神，在除治三害获得初步胜利的基础上，中共兰考县委又提出了第二个三五年内进一步改造大自然的方案，提交前不久召开的全县四级干部大会讨论通过。在这次大会上，县委再一次报告了焦裕禄同志光辉的革命事迹。大家回忆起三年前在同样的大会上，焦裕禄同志领导人们制订第一个改造自然的方案时，曾经立誓说：“不改变兰考的面貌，我死不瞑目。”如今，焦裕禄同志逝世已经一年多了，但是大家想到这一情景，心情激昂，增添了改造自然的信心和力量。
    好榜样
    城关公社韩村生产队、堌阳公社秦寨大队、张君墓公社赵垛楼大队和红庙公社双杨树大队，是焦裕禄同志在兰考倡导树立的四面红旗。“韩村的精神，秦寨的决心，赵垛楼的干劲，双杨树的道路”，在过去三年兰考人民改变自然面貌的斗争中，曾经发挥了巨大的作用。如今，这四个单位的生产又有了新的发展。秦寨大队深翻的土地，三年中由几十亩增加到三千六百亩，粮食年产量由二十二万斤增加到九十四万斤。三年前，赵垛楼大队制定第一个改造自然的方案，计划粮食总产量要由十六万斤增到一百万斤时，曾经有人表示怀疑，但是一九六五年粮食总产量却达到了一百零六万斤。双杨树大队的集体经济更加巩固并且有了进一步的发展。韩村生产队的三百五十亩碱洼地全部修成了台田，粮食、花生产量显著上升。这个队的社员，为了帮助邻队李楼生产队翻身，不再吃统销粮，前不久，曾经主动借给李楼一千四百斤余粮，送粮的人，又帮助李楼制订了修台田的具体规划。这种阶级情谊，激起了李楼人的干劲，他们一举就修好了七十亩台田。在不久前召开的四级干部会上，这四个大队仍然被树为红旗。
    现在，兰考县三十六万人民决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，以焦裕禄为榜样，建设新兰考。
