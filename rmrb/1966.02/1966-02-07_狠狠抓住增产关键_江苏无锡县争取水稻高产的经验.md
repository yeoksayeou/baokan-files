    Wuxi County, a well-known high-yield rice county in Jiangsu Province, at all levels, its leaders and the vast number of cadres and commune members, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, and implement revolutionary zeal and scientific attitude on the key to increased rice production. On the basis of continuous three years of stable and high yields, they achieved another increase in 1965. The county’s 820,000 mu of single-season rice achieved an average yield per mu exceeding the target set by the "National Program for Agricultural Development," an increase of 6 percent over the previous year. Wheat also achieved a bumper harvest. The average yield per mu of both wheat and rice for the whole year exceeded 1,000 jin.

    The fact that Wuxi County continued to increase rice production in 1965 fully demonstrates that: to make production continuously advance, the thinking of the people must first continuously revolutionize; to make people maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit, it is necessary to frequently combine it with the ideological reality and production reality of each period, and creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

    1964 was the third year of Wuxi County's continuous stable and high rice yields. In the winter of this year, when various places were discussing whether or not to and whether they could continue to move forward in 1965, some cadres and masses of the communes and teams revealed sentiments of pride and complacency, stagnation, and self-sufficiency. Some high-yield units believed that "the pagoda has reached its peak, potential has been exhausted, and there is no more to increase," "only to maintain, not to leap forward." Some low-yield units felt content and satisfied with the status quo, thinking that "the conditions are not good, the yield per mu is not high, the total output is not small, and the contribution is not small." Still other cadres and masses believed that the problem of eating had been solved and did not want to put in any more effort to strive for high yields.

    The county party committee discovered these ideological seedlings from various model points and promptly led the cadres and masses of the entire county to study Chairman Mao's "Get Rid of the Burden and Start Up the Machine," which opened up everyone's minds and established the ambition to achieve even higher yields.

    Later, in the various key stages of rice production and in promoting various new measures to increase production, cadres at all levels and many commune members, in response to the problems that appeared in production, work, and ideology at the time, respectively studied Chairman Mao's "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and other articles. Some brigade cadres of Dongting Commune reflected that: after studying Chairman Mao's works, their ideological awareness had been raised, and they had jumped out of three circles: first, jumping out of the family circle and wholeheartedly serving the people; second, jumping out of the circle of affairs and paying attention to doing investigation and research work and the ideological and political work of the masses; third, jumping out of the circle of their own team and caring about the overall interests. Cadres at all levels took another step forward in ideological revolutionization and work style revolutionization. Last year, the number of cadres at all levels in the county who stayed in selected spots to create models was greater than the previous year, and their work style was more down-to-earth.

    Next, the Wuxi County Party Committee led the cadres and masses of the entire county in carrying out an activity of summarizing and evaluating, and learning from each other. By summarizing the achievements of 1964, some advanced units were selected as models for the entire county to learn from. These advanced units all had a common characteristic, that is, they had red ideology, great determination, strong drive, and hard measures. Cadres and commune members at all levels compared themselves with the models, identified gaps, found reasons, and tapped potential. By comparing and identifying, they saw not only the achievements in increasing production but also the shortcomings in production. Then, many cadres of communes and teams went to Jiading County and Nanhui County in Shanghai Municipality and to the advanced units in the various counties of Suzhou Prefecture to visit and study.

    After summarizing, evaluating, and visiting and studying, leaders at all levels and the broad masses recognized the situation of "having models in front and chasers behind," further unloaded their ideological "burdens," and mustered revolutionary drive. Then, the county party committee put forward the fighting slogan of "Advancing in Victory, Continuously Revolutionizing, Surpassing Suzhou and Overtaking Jiading," and put forward the goal of struggle for 1965. A production competition upsurge to catch up with and surpass Jiading was launched throughout the county.

    The county party committee believed that to continue to increase production, many new contradictions would inevitably be encountered, and only by effectively solving these new contradictions could they continue to move forward. The leaders of the county party committee took these thoughts and views to the masses for a large-scale discussion. After the masses discussed it, the new contradictions for continuing to increase production were found, and the methods for solving these new contradictions were also put forward.

    In the entire production process from rice planting to harvesting, leaders at all levels and the broad masses of Wuxi County firmly grasped every key to increasing production, worked hard, worked practically, and worked cleverly, accumulating each stage's "small victories" into a "big victory" for the whole. In terms of variety, they vigorously promoted the high-yielding fine variety "Nongken 58"; in terms of fertilizer, they widely planted green manure crops, salvaged aquatic plants, cut green grass, salvaged fish manure, collected miscellaneous fertilizer, dug grass pond mud, and raised pigs, sheep, and rabbits; in terms of water conservancy construction, relying on the strength of the collective economy, they added mechanical and electrical drainage and irrigation equipment, universally leveled the land, and established dual-purpose drainage and irrigation canals, thoroughly solving the problem of flooding and cross-irrigation of 300,000 mu of paddy fields, so that all rice fields achieved thin-water and frequent irrigation, which was conducive to increased production, while the cost of bailing water was 24 percent lower than in 1964; in terms of production technology, the county trained more than 8,000 peasant technicians, established technology extension stations in every commune, and equipped brigades and production teams with peasant technicians, and also established more than 2,300 mass scientific experiment groups to carry out scientific experiment activities, more effectively promoting Chen Yongkang's rice high-yield experience. The spirit of continuous revolution, coupled with these solid measures, raised Wuxi County's rice production in 1965 to a new level.

    狠狠抓住增产关键
    江苏无锡县争取水稻高产的经验
    江苏著名水稻高产县无锡县的各级领导和广大干部社员，活学活用毛主席著作，发扬不断革命精神，把革命干劲和科学态度落实在水稻增产关键上面，在连续三年稳产高产的基础上，一九六五年又获得增产。全县八十二万亩一季水稻，平均亩产量超过了“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标，比上一年度增产百分之六。麦子也获得丰收。全年麦、稻两熟，平均亩产量超过了千斤。
    无锡县一九六五年水稻持续增产的事实充分说明：要使生产不断前进，首先要人的思想不断革命；要使人们保持旺盛的革命精神，又必须经常结合各个时期的思想实际和生产实际，活学活用毛主席著作。
    一九六四年是无锡县水稻持续稳产高产的第三个年头。这年冬天，各地在议论一九六五年要不要、能不能继续前进的问题时，一部分社队干部和群众流露出骄傲自满、故步自封和自给自足的情绪。一些高产单位认为“宝塔结顶，潜力挖尽，无产可增”，“只能保，不能跳”。一些低产单位自以为“条件不好，单产不高，总产不少，贡献不小”，而心安理得，满足现状。还有一部分干部群众认为吃饭问题已经解决，不想再出力出汗争高产。
    县委从各个样板点上发现了这些思想苗头，及时领导全县干部和群众学习了毛主席《放下包袱，开动机器》一文，打开了大家的心窍，树立了高产更高产的雄心壮志。
    以后，在水稻生产的各个关键阶段和推行各项新的增产措施时，各级干部和许多社员针对当时生产、工作和思想上出现的问题，分别学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》、《纪念白求恩》等文章。东亭公社的一些大队干部反映：学了毛主席著作，提高了思想觉悟，跳出了三个圈子：一是跳出了家庭圈子，一心一意为人民服务；二是跳出事务圈子，注意做调查研究工作和群众的思想政治工作；三是跳出本队的圈子，关心全局利益。各级干部在思想革命化和作风革命化方面又前进了一步。全县各级干部去年蹲点办样板的人比起上一年更多了，工作作风更踏实了。
    接着，无锡县委又领导全县干部、群众开展了一个总结评比、互相学习的活动。通过总结一九六四年的成就，评选一些先进单位，作为全县学习的标兵。这些先进单位都有一个共同特点，就是思想红、决心大、干劲足、措施硬。各级干部和社员群众对照标兵，排差距，找原因，挖潜力。一比一找，既看到了增产的成绩，也看到了生产上的缺点。然后，许多社队干部到上海市的嘉定县、南汇县和所在的苏州专区各县的先进单位去参观学习。
    经过总结评比和参观学习，各级领导和广大群众认清了“前有标兵，后有追兵”的形势，进一步卸下了思想“包袱”，鼓起了革命干劲。接着，县委提出“乘胜前进，不断革命，跳出苏州超嘉定”的战斗口号，提出了一九六五年的奋斗目标。全县就掀起了赶超嘉定的生产竞赛热潮。
    县委认为，要继续增产，必然会遇到许多新的矛盾，只有切实解决这些新的矛盾，才能继续前进。县委领导上把这些想法和看法拿到群众中去大讨论。经群众一议论，继续增产的新矛盾找出来了，解决这些新矛盾的办法也提上来了。
    在水稻从种到收的整个生产过程中，无锡县的各级领导和广大群众狠狠地抓住每一项增产关键，苦干、实干、巧干，积每个阶段的“小胜”为全局的“大胜”。在品种方面，大力推广高产良种“农垦五十八”；在肥料方面，广种绿肥作物，捞水草，割青草，捞鱼粪，拾杂肥，挖草塘泥，养猪羊兔；在水利建设方面，依靠集体经济的力量，增添机电排灌设备，普遍平田整地，建立排灌两用渠道，彻底解决了三十万亩稻田的漫灌串灌问题，使全部水稻田实现了薄水勤灌，有利于增产，戽水费却比一九六四年降低百分之二十四；在生产技术方面，全县培训了八千多名农民技术员，社社建立了技术推广站，大队、生产队都配备了农民技术员，还建立了二千三百多个群众性的科学实验小组，开展科学实验活动，更有成效地推广了陈永康水稻高产经验。不断革命精神加上这些扎扎实实的措施，把无锡县一九六五年的水稻生产提高到了一个新的水平。
