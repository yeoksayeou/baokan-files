   "Peace" Fraud Thoroughly Bankrupt; War Blackmail Is Bound to Fail
    American Bandits Savagely Resume Bombing North Vietnam
    Vietnamese Military and Civilians' Anger Soars, Shooting Down Five Enemy Planes
    Representative of the Vietnam People's Army Protests in Telegram, Sternly Pointing Out That the United States Must Bear Full Responsibility for the Consequences of This New "Escalation" Action

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 31st – After the complete bankruptcy of its "peace" fraud, American imperialism brazenly resumed bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the morning of the 31st.

    According to a radio announcement here at noon on the 31st, on the morning of the 31st, American imperialism dispatched multiple batches of jet fighters to barbarously bomb and strafe some residential areas in Son La, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, and Quang Binh provinces in North Vietnam.

    The military and civilians in these areas, with high hatred for the enemy and the determination to defeat the American invading bandits, heroically threw themselves into battle, intercepting enemy aircraft with a fierce and dense network of fire, giving the American aerial bandits severe punishment.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 31st – According to an announcement here on the afternoon of the 31st, the military and civilians of Quang Binh, Ha Tinh, and Nghe An provinces in North Vietnam heroically fought back against the invading American bandit aircraft. According to initial reports, a total of five enemy planes were shot down, and several others were damaged.

    On the 31st, American imperialism dispatched multiple batches of jet aircraft to invade the airspace of Quang Binh, Ha Tinh, Nghe An, Thanh Hoa, and Son La provinces to carry out savage bombing and strafing. The military and civilians in these areas, with burning hatred, dealt a heavy blow to the invading aerial bandits.

    In Quang Binh Province, the first volley of artillery fire shot down an American A-4 jet fighter. Then, when American planes came to rescue the pilots who had crashed into the sea, another plane was shot down.

    In Ha Tinh Province, just as the American bandit aircraft were about to carry out an air raid, an F-105 jet fighter was immediately shot down.

    In Nghe An Province, the heroic military and civilians also fiercely attacked the invading enemy planes, shooting down an A-4 jet fighter and another jet fighter in one fell swoop.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 31st – Colonel Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, sent an urgent telegram to the Chairman of the International Commission for Vietnam on the 31st, strongly condemning and protesting the new war actions of the US Air Force on the 31st in bombing Son La, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, and Quang Binh provinces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as Vinh City and Hon Gai Island.

    The telegram emphatically pointed out that these barbaric attacks by the US Air Force prove that the US government's so-called "seeking peace" movement is obviously to ease the condemnation of the American and world people, and to cover up the US conspiracy and actions to strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. This kind of war action by American imperialism once again exposes the falsehood of US President Johnson's so-called "peace sincerity" and fully proves that the US's recent trick of "suspending the bombing of North Vietnam" is only a means to deceive public opinion.

    The telegram said that American imperialism blatantly uses the air force to attack the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—an independent and sovereign country, a member of the socialist camp. This is an extremely blatant and dangerous act of aggression, and a rude provocation to peace-loving and righteous public opinion in the world, which is strongly condemning the US imperialist policy of aggression in Vietnam, and condemning its criminal bombing and strafing of North Vietnam.

    The telegram said that the US Air Force's bandit attack on the 31st is a gross violation of the sovereignty, territory, and security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and a blatant trampling on the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue and international law. It also creates an extremely serious crisis for the peace and tranquility of Indochina and Southeast Asian countries. The US government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by this new "escalation" action.

    The telegram expressed strong opposition to and accusation of the above-mentioned illegal and barbaric bombing and strafing by the United States, and firmly demanded that the US government must immediately stop all war actions against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, stop the war of aggression against South Vietnam, completely withdraw the troops of the United States and its puppets from South Vietnam, and respect and strictly fulfill the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue.

   “和平”骗局彻底破产　战争讹诈必定失败
    美国强盗野蛮恢复轰炸越南北方
    越南军民怒火冲天打下敌机五架
    越南人民军代表抗议电中严正指出美国必须对这一新“升级”行动的后果负全责
    新华社河内三十一日电  美帝国主义在它的“和平”骗局彻底破产之后，三十一日上午悍然再次恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸。
    据这里电台三十一日中午公布：三十一日上午，美帝国主义派遣喷气式战斗机多批，对越南北方山萝、清化、义安、河静和广平等省的一些居民区进行了野蛮的轰炸和扫射。
    这些地区的军民怀着对敌人的高度仇恨和战胜美国侵略强盗的决心，英勇地投入战斗，以猛烈和密集的火网截击敌机，给予美国空中强盗以严厉惩罚。
    新华社河内三十一日电  据这里三十一日下午公布：越南北方广平、河静和义安等省军民三十一日英勇迎击入侵的美国强盗飞机，据初步消息，共打落敌机五架，打伤多架。
    三十一日，美帝国主义派出多批喷气式飞机侵入广平、河静、义安、清化和山萝等省上空进行野蛮轰炸和扫射。这些地区的军民怀着仇恨的烈火，给来犯的空中强盗以沉重的打击。
    广平省军民第一阵炮弹就打落美国A—4型喷气式飞机一架。接着，在美国飞机前来营救坠落在海里的飞行员时，又被击落一架。
    在河静省，当美国强盗飞机刚刚要进行空袭的时候，就立即被击落F—105型喷气式飞机一架。
    在义安省，英雄的军民也迎头痛击来犯的敌机，一举打落A—4型喷气式飞机一架和另一架喷气式飞机。
    新华社河内三十一日电  越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校三十一日打紧急电报给越南国际委员会主席，强烈谴责和抗议美国空军三十一日轰炸越南民主共和国山萝、清化、义安和广平等省以及荣市和昏果岛的新的战争行动。
    电报强调指出，美国空军这些野蛮的进攻证明，美国政府的所谓“谋求和平”运动，显然是为了缓和美国人民和世界人民的谴责，掩盖美国强化和扩大侵略越南战争的阴谋和行动。美帝国主义的这种战争行动再一次揭穿了美国总统约翰逊的所谓“和平诚意”是虚假的，并且充分地证明了美国最近玩弄“暂停轰炸越南北方”的花招，只是为了欺骗舆论的一种手段。
    电报说，美帝国主义又公然用空军进攻越南民主共和国——一个独立和拥有主权的国家，社会主义阵营的成员之一，这是极其明目张胆和危险的侵略行动，是对正在强烈谴责美帝国主义在越南的侵略政策、谴责它对越南北方充满罪恶的轰炸和扫射的世界上爱好和平和正义的舆论的粗暴挑衅。
    电报说，美国空军三十一日的强盗袭击，是对越南民主共和国的主权、领土和安全的粗暴侵犯，是对一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议和国际公法明目张胆的蹂躏。它还给印度支那和东南亚各国和平和安宁造成了一种极其严重的危机。美国政府必须对由于它们这一新的“升级”行动所造成的一切后果承担全部责任。
    电报表示强烈反对和控诉美国上述非法和野蛮的轰炸和扫射，并坚决要求美国政府必须立即停止对越南民主共和国的一切战争行动，停止对越南南方的侵略战争，从越南南方全部撤走美国和它的仆从的军队，尊重并严正履行一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议。
