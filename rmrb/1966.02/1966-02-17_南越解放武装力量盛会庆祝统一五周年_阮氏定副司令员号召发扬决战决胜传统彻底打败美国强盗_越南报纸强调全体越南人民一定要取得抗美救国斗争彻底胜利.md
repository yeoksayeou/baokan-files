    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 16th (via dispatch) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Command of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces solemnly held a grand meeting in a liberated area on the 15th to warmly celebrate the fifth anniversary of the unification of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces.

    Attending the meeting were all members of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, all members of the Liberation Armed Forces Command, representatives of mass organizations under the leadership of the National Liberation Front, cadres of central organs, and representatives of various organs and units of the Liberation Armed Forces Command.

    Nguyen Thi Dinh, Deputy Commander of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, delivered a report on behalf of the Liberation Armed Forces Command. She detailed the growth and strengthening of the Liberation Armed Forces and analyzed the reasons for the victories achieved by the Liberation Armed Forces over the past five years.

    She said that in the past five years, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have grown rapidly and achieved increasingly brilliant victories. The leaps and bounds of the Liberation Armed Forces are mainly reflected in:

    First, they have developed from scattered units into an armed force under unified command, including main forces, local forces, and guerrillas.

    Second, their technical, tactical, and command levels have been improved. The Liberation Armed Forces, using the tactics of people's war, bravely attack the enemy, and they are now able to eliminate entire enemy battalions or even entire battle groups in a single battle.

    Third, their political and ideological levels are constantly improving. The Liberation Armed Forces continue to enhance their class consciousness, carry forward the glorious traditions of the people's army, be extremely brave in battle, overcome numerous difficulties, and defeat the enemy in any situation.

    Fourth, they have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and done everything possible to ensure their own supply of materials.

    When talking about the glorious achievements of the South Vietnamese army and people in the past five years, Nguyen Thi Dinh said that the Liberation Armed Forces have conducted more than 145,000 battles, eliminating more than 500,000 enemy troops, including 22,600 American invaders, and completely annihilating 60 entire enemy battalions. They also helped the people destroy thousands of "strategic hamlets."

    She said that although the American aggressors have been beaten to the point of desperation, they have not abandoned their aggressive conspiracies and are doing their best to plot new conspiracies in an attempt to save their defeat. We must be highly vigilant against their vicious conspiracies. No matter what cunning conspiracies they adopt, we will surely burn them to ashes. No matter how long the battle takes, no matter how arduous the battle is, we will work with all the people to complete our glorious historical mission.

    She called on all cadres and soldiers to continue to maintain and carry forward the tradition of decisive victory of the revolutionary army for the sacred cause of liberating the South, defending the North, and unifying the motherland, to always hold their guns tightly, and to resolutely fight until the aggressive ambitions of the American bandits are completely shattered.

    Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, read out the holiday congratulatory letter from the Presidium of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front to all cadres and soldiers of the Liberation Armed Forces at the meeting, and announced the decision of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front to award the Liberation Armed Forces the first-class "Bronze Wall" Medal.

    The atmosphere of the meeting was very warm, and the participants were in high spirits. They constantly applauded and cheered, celebrating victory and shouting battle slogans to resolutely fight and win against the American bandits.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 15th (via dispatch) – The Vietnamese newspaper *Nhan Dan* published an editorial on the 15th on the fifth anniversary of the unification of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, pointing out that the South Vietnamese people are putting the slogan "The whole people fight against the American aggressors, every person is a soldier, and every village is a fortress" into action, pushing the people's war to an unprecedented height. The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces and the Vietnam People's Army have excellently inherited and carried forward the heroic traditions and rich experience of the Vietnamese nation in armed struggle. This is a tradition of fighting unremittingly, a tradition of the weak defeating the strong, and a tradition of righteous forces opposing brutal forces. This is a spirit of infinite loyalty to the motherland and the people, a determination to dare to fight, dare to win, dare to overcome any difficulties, and defeat any enemy. The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have contributed to creating valuable experiences in the people's revolutionary war and have summarized rich experiences in fighting against and defeating the American aggressors.

    The editorial concluded by saying that the army and people of North Vietnam are learning from the heroic spirit of the army and people of South Vietnam and their creative combat experience, ensuring their determination to defeat the destructive war of the United States, defend the North, and fully support the anti-American national salvation struggle of the people and Liberation Armed Forces of the South. All the Vietnamese people and their armed forces are guaranteed to go all out to defeat the American aggressors and achieve complete victory in the anti-American patriotic struggle.

    The Vietnamese newspaper *Quan Doi Nhan Dan* also published an editorial on the 15th, saying that today, in South Vietnam, no matter where, anyone has become a warrior in attacking the American aggressors and attacking the puppet army. They have created many ingenious methods of attacking the enemy, which make the American aggressors and traitors lose their souls. The editorial said that through the competition on the battlefield, we have sufficient grounds to determine that no matter how stubborn and cunning the American aggressors are, no matter what scale they are prepared to strengthen and advance the war to, no matter if it continues to transport hundreds of thousands of troops, the South Vietnamese army and people still have enough power to completely defeat it militarily and politically.

    新华社河内十六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量指挥部十五日在解放区某地隆重举行大会，热烈庆祝越南南方解放武装力量统一五周年。
    参加大会的，有越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会全体委员和解放武装力量指挥部的全体成员，以及在民族解放阵线领导下的各群众团体的代表、中央机关干部、解放武装力量指挥部各机关和单位的代表等。
    越南南方解放武装力量副司令员阮氏定代表解放武装力量指挥部在大会上作了报告。她详细地叙述了解放武装力量的成长壮大过程，分析了五年来解放武装力量取得胜利的原因。
    她说，五年来，越南南方解放武装力量已经迅速成长，接连取得了日益辉煌的战绩。解放武装力量的飞跃进步主要表现在：
    第一，他们已经从分散的部队发展成为一支在统一指挥下的包括主力部队、地方部队和游击队的武装力量。
    第二，他们的技术、战术和指挥的水平已经得到了提高。解放武装力量运用人民战争的战术，英勇地打击敌人，他们现在已经能够在一次战斗中消灭整营甚至整个战团的敌军。
    第三，他们的政治和思想水平不断提高。解放武装力量继续不断地提高阶级觉悟，发扬人民军队的光荣传统，在战斗中非常勇敢，克服重重困难，能在任何情况下打败敌人。
    第四，他们发扬了自力更生的精神，尽一切力量保证了自己的物资供应。
    阮氏定在谈到越南南方军民五年来的光辉的战绩时说，解放武装力量已经进行了十四万五千次以上的战斗，消灭了包括两万二千六百名美国侵略者在内的五十多万敌军，全歼了敌军六十个整营。他们还帮助人民捣毁了数以千计的“战略村”。
    她说，美国侵略者虽然被打得走投无路，但是他们并没有放弃他们的侵略阴谋，而且正在竭力策划新的阴谋，妄图挽救他们的失败。我们必须对他们的恶毒阴谋保持高度的警惕，不管他们采取什么狡猾的阴谋，我们定将把他们烧为灰烬。不管战斗要进行多久，不管战斗多么艰苦，我们将同全体人民一起来完成我们光荣的历史使命。
    她号召全体干部和战士，为了解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的神圣事业，继续保持和发扬革命军队的决战决胜传统，永远握紧枪杆，坚决战斗到彻底粉碎美国强盗的侵略野心时为止。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿在大会上宣读了民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团给解放武装力量全体干部和战士的节日贺信，并且宣布了民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团授予解放武装力量一级“铜墙”勋章的决定。
    大会气氛十分热烈，与会者情绪高昂，他们不断鼓掌、欢呼，庆祝胜利并振臂高呼决战决胜美国强盗的战斗口号。
    据新华社河内十五日电　越南《人民报》十五日就越南南方解放武装力量统一五周年发表社论指出，越南南方人民正在把“全民都同美国侵略者作战，每一个人都是战士，每一个乡村都是堡垒”的口号付诸行动，把人民战争推进到空前的高度。越南南方解放武装力量和越南人民军一起出色地继承和发扬了越南民族在武装斗争中的英雄主义传统和丰富的经验。这是百折不挠地进行斗争的传统，这是弱小的力量打败强敌的传统，这是正义的力量反对残暴势力的传统。这是无限忠于祖国和人民的精神，这是敢于战斗，敢于胜利，敢于克服任何困难和打败任何敌人的决心。越南南方解放武装力量对创造人民革命战争的宝贵经验作出了贡献，并且总结出了同美国侵略者作战和打败美国侵略者的丰富的经验。
    社论最后说，越南北方军民学习越南南方军民的英勇精神和他们创造性的作战经验，保证决心挫败美国的破坏性战争，保卫北方，并全力支持南方人民和解放武装力量的抗美救国斗争。全体越南人民和他们的武装力量保证要全力以赴打败美国侵略者，取得抗美爱国斗争的彻底胜利。
    越南《人民军队报》也在十五日发表社论说，今天，在越南南方，不论在什么地方，任何一个人，都成了打击美国侵略者和打击伪军的勇士，他们创造了很多巧妙的打击敌人的方法，使得美国侵略者和卖国贼丧魂失魄。社论说，通过在战场上的较量，我们已经有了充分的根据来断定：不管美国侵略者如何顽固、狡猾，准备把战争加强和推进到怎样的规模，不管它继续运进几十万军队，越南南方军民仍然有足够力量在军事上以及在政治上彻底打败它。（附图片）
