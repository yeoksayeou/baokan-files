　　Comrade Jiao Yulu worked at the Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory for nine years. During these nine years, he worked diligently, leaving a deep impression on the workers. Now, people recall many past events of Comrade Jiao Yulu's work at that time, and these "past events" are still as educational as they were then. The following recollections are just a small part of them.

　　In the Storm...
    One day in the late autumn of 1953, Jiao Yulu was leading laborers to build a highway. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, thunder rumbled, and then a torrential downpour began.
    Jiao Yulu braved the heavy rain to inspect the work in various places before returning to the work shed. Before the water was even wrung out of his clothes, a technician ran up to him, panting, and reported: "There is still a section of the drainage ditch on the highway that hasn't been dug through. With such heavy rain, the highway will soon be washed away!"
    Upon hearing this, Jiao Yulu suddenly stood up and asked, "Then why don't you quickly organize people to dig?"
    "The weather is too cold, and it's hard to organize manpower."
    Before the technician could finish speaking, Jiao Yulu said, "We cannot simply rely on words to command everyone, but more importantly, we must lead everyone with our own practical actions." After speaking, Jiao Yulu first grabbed a shovel, took a stride, and rushed out of the work shed, disappearing into the storm... The comrades in the work shed, seeing Jiao Yulu rush out, also followed closely behind.
    Driven by Jiao Yulu and others, the laborers also rushed to dig the drainage ditch.
    Before long, the drainage ditch was finally dug through, the rainwater was successfully drained away, and the safety of the highway was ensured.

　　焦裕禄同志在洛阳矿山机器厂工作了九年。九年来，他一直辛勤地工作着，在职工中留下了深刻的印象。现在，人们回忆起焦裕禄同志当时工作的许多往事，这些“往事”仍象当时一样具有教育意义。这里刊登的几则回忆，就是其中的一小部分。
                    　　编者
　　在暴风雨中……
    一九五三年秋末的一天，焦裕禄正领着民工在修筑公路。忽然，阴云密布，雷声滚滚，紧接着瓢泼似的大雨便倾盆而降。
    焦裕禄冒着大雨到各处检查完工作才回到工棚，衣服上的水还没拧干，一个技术员便气喘吁吁地跑来向他报告说：“公路上还有一段排水沟没挖通，雨又下得这么大，很快便会把公路冲垮的！”
    焦裕禄一听这话，忽的一下站起身来，问：“那为什么不赶快组织人挖？”
    “天气太冷，人力不好组织。”
    不等那位技术员说完，焦裕禄便说：“我们不能单纯依靠嘴来指挥大家，更重要的是要以自己的实际行动来带动大家。”说完，焦裕禄便首先抄起一把铁锹，一个箭步，冲出了工棚，消失在暴风雨之中……。工棚里的同志们见焦裕禄冲出去后，也紧跟着冲了出去。
    在焦裕禄他们的带动下，民工们也都争先恐后地赶来抢挖排水沟。
    没有多长时间，排水沟终于被挖通了，雨水顺利地排了出去，保住了公路的安全。
