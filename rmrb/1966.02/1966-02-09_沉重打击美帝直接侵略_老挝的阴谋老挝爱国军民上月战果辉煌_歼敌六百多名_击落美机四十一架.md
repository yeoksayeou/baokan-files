　　The radio said that the military and civilians of Savannakhet, Saravane, and Luang Prabang provinces shot down six U.S. bandit aircraft on January 8, 16, and 26 respectively.

　　On January 8, the military and civilians of Savannakhet Province shot down a U.S. B-57 aircraft. Four American pilots on board were killed on the spot. On January 16, the military and civilians of Saravane Province shot down two U.S. jet aircraft and damaged one.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 4th dispatch. According to a broadcast by Radio Pathet Lao, the spokesperson of the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army issued a communique on the 2nd regarding the large-scale bombing of the liberated areas of Khammouane Province by U.S. aircraft, stating: The U.S. imperialists owe the Lao people a blood debt, and they must repay it with their blood! The communique sternly warned the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs that no matter what new types of aircraft they use, no matter how many tons of bombs and shells they use, they cannot shake the revolutionary fighting spirit of the Lao people. On the contrary, this can only further deepen the Lao people's hatred for them and make them determined to carry the anti-American patriotic struggle through to the end.

    据新华社康开四日电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝人民解放军最高指挥部发言人二日就美国飞机大规模轰炸甘蒙省解放区发表公报说：美帝国主义欠下老挝人民的血债，一定要用它的血来偿还！公报严厉警告美帝国主义及其走狗，不论它们使用什么新式飞机，使用多少吨炸弹和炮弹，也动摇不了老挝人民的革命斗争精神。相反，这只能更加加深老挝人民对它们的仇恨，使他们坚决把反美爱国斗争进行到底。
