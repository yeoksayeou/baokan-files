    Sinister "Good Deeds"
    Yuan Lu
    On February 4th, Johnson announced to reporters that India was facing a "very serious situation" due to the famine. He had "most urgently allocated" a batch of grain to be shipped to India and would be meeting with India's new Prime Minister, Mrs. Gandhi, to determine "further actions and more measures that the United States can take to help our friends and the Indian people."
    Look how concerned Johnson is about the Indian people! Although the failure of the war of aggression against Vietnam has put the United States in a "very serious situation" as well, he is still so concerned about the Indian people's empty stomachs, and even rushed to make the decision to ship grain to India the day before going to Honolulu. He himself is in a terrible mess, yet he does not forget to "help the distressed and relieve the poor." Does the American President really have such a philanthropic heart to help others?
    Of course, no one will believe this.
    The United States' "concern" about the Indian people's empty stomachs has a long history. In 1950, the United States' first "aid" to India was a wheat loan of $190 million. At that time, Johnson's predecessor, Truman, also put on a philanthropic pose, saying that this was "a spontaneous and heartfelt expression of the United States' assistance to the Indian people in times of distress." Subsequently, the United States took "further actions" and "more measures," and in 1952 signed a "cooperation agreement" with India, ostensibly to help India "increase food production and develop rural construction." Since then, the United States has increasingly used food to "aid" India, and the amount increased significantly after the two countries signed the "Agricultural Commodities Agreement" in 1956.
    What was the result of this action, which was touted as "helping the distressed and relieving the poor?" For the United States, the situation is quite satisfactory. Before 1950, India was mainly under British control, and the United States' influence was insignificant. The United States' first aid to India was like a knock on the door, opening the door for the United States' forces to enter India on a large scale. While Truman was playing the philanthropist, the United States stipulated harsh conditions for this loan: in addition to the fact that the price of wheat was higher than that in the United States domestic market and that the principal and interest had to be repaid in US dollars, India also had to agree to provide the United States with strategic materials that were originally prohibited from export, build a ferromanganese plant with US capital as the mainstay, and ship most of the plant's products to the United States. The agreements signed and the "aid" provided thereafter, step by step, used various conditions to pave the way for the penetration of US capital, the dumping of commodities, and the plunder of raw materials. In this way, India's economic lifeline was gradually controlled by the United States. In a letter to the editor published in the New India Times on February 20th of last year, a reader wrote painfully about India's increasing dependence on the United States: "Now, all that India lacks is for the government leaders to be replaced by foreigners!"
    As for India's food problem, under this kind of "help" from the United States, it has become more and more serious. The large-scale dumping of US "surplus" grain has severely hit India's agricultural economy, causing a large number of Indian farmers to go bankrupt. From 1959 to 1962, the planting area of ​​food crops in India decreased by 447,000 hectares (each hectare equals 15 mu); and in 1963-1964, the planting area decreased by another 1.84 million hectares. Therefore, although the amount of US food "aid" has increased year by year, India's food crisis has deepened day by day, and has developed to today's "very serious situation" as Johnson said.
    Under these circumstances, Johnson's talk about helping India solve the food shortage problem can only be said to be utter hypocrisy. Moreover, after talking about so-called "helping the Indian people," he immediately suggested that India also do something to help the United States. To put it bluntly, he wants to further place India under US control and further serve the US's aggressive policies. This makes it even clearer that the American President's "helping the distressed and relieving the poor" is nothing more than a sinister act of neo-colonialism.

    罪恶的“善举”
    元潞
    约翰逊在二月四日向记者宣布，印度由于粮荒而正面临着“非常严重的局势”，他已经
  “最紧急地指拨”一批粮食运往印度，并且将同印度新总理甘地夫人会谈，来确定美国对“我们的朋友和印度人民有所帮助所能采取的进一步的行动和更多的措施”。
    看，约翰逊对印度人民是多么关心啊。尽管侵越战争的失败使美国也面临着“非常严重的局势”，但他仍然那末牵挂着印度人民的饿肚子问题，而在去檀香山前一天还要赶着作出运粮印度的决定。自己正在焦头烂额，还不忘于“扶危济困”，难道美国的总统老爷真有着这种助人为乐的菩萨心肠吗？
    当然，决不会有人相信这一点。
    美国“关心”印度人民的饿肚子问题由来已久。一九五○年美国给印度的第一笔
  “援助”就是为数一亿九千万美元的小麦贷款。当时约翰逊的前任杜鲁门也曾作出一副慈善家姿态，说这是美国“在印度人民急难之时进行援助的自发的、衷心的一种表现”。接着美国又采取了“进一步的行动”和“更多的措施”，在一九五二年同印度签订了一个
  “合作协定”，据说目的是帮助印度“增加粮食生产和发展乡村建设”。在这以后，美国越来越多地用粮食“援助”印度，到一九五六年双方签订了“农业商品协定”以后为数更是大量增加。
    美国的这种被吹嘘为“扶危济困”的行动结果怎样呢？对美国说来，情况是颇堪满意的。在一九五○年前，印度主要处于英国控制之下，美国的势力还是微不足道的。美国给印度的第一笔援助，就象敲门砖一样，为美国的势力大举进入印度打开了大门。在杜鲁门扮演慈善家的同时，美国为这笔贷款规定了苛刻的条件：除了小麦作价比美国国内市场还高和还本付息要用美元以外，印度还得同意向美国提供本来是禁止出口的战略物资，修建以美资为主的锰铁厂，并把这个厂的大部分产品运给美国。在这以后签订的一个个协定和提供的一笔笔“援助”，循序而进，用各种各样的条件为美国的资本渗入、商品倾销、掠夺原料开路。这样，就使印度的经济命脉一步一步被美国所控制。在去年二月二十日的《新印度时报》上，有一个读者在来信里谈到印度对美国依赖性越来越严重的情况时沉痛地写道：“现在印度所欠缺的只剩下政府领导人换成外国人了！”
    至于印度的粮食问题呢，在美国的这种“帮助”下，却是越解决越严重了。美国“剩余”粮食的大量倾销，沉重地打击了印度农业经济，使印度大量农民破产。一九五九年到一九六二年三年中，印度粮食作物种植面积就减少了四十四万七千公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）；而一九六三至一九六四年度，播种面积又减少了一百八十四万公顷。因此，尽管美国粮食“援助”的数量逐年上升，印度的粮食危机却日益加深，而发展到今天面临了象约翰逊所说的那种“非常严重的局势”。
    在这种情况下，约翰逊还大谈什么帮助印度解决粮荒问题，只能说是透顶的伪善。而且，他在谈到所谓对“印度人民有所帮助”以后，紧接着马上提出也要印度做一些帮助美国的事情，把话说明了，无非是要把印度进一步置于美国控制之下，进一步为美国的侵略政策效劳。这就使人更加清楚地看到，美国总统老爷所干的这种“扶危济困”的善举，不过是一种新殖民主义的罪恶勾当而已。
