　　The Most Powerful Leadership
    How did Comrade Jiao Yulu lead the people of Lankao in their struggle to transform nature? The four articles published in this newspaper today provide new, vivid, and concrete materials. These materials fully demonstrate that Comrade Jiao Yulu, in implementing the Party's mass line, is worthy of being a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We should go to the masses, learn from them, synthesize their experience into better, more systematic principles and methods, then tell the masses (propaganda), and call on them to put them into practice, solve the problems of the masses, and liberate and make the masses happy." This is exactly what Comrade Jiao Yulu did.
    For generations, the people of Lankao County have struggled against severe natural disasters, accumulating various experiences. These experiences are scattered among the broad masses. The task of leading cadres is to strive to learn from the masses, to go deep into the broad masses to discover, concentrate, and elevate the experience of the masses. Comrade Jiao Yulu went deep into the vast rural areas of Lankao, concentrated the anti-disaster experience scattered among the broad masses, and refined it into "the spirit of Hancun, the determination of Qinzhai, the drive of Zhaoduolou, and the road of Shuangyangshu," establishing four banners for the people of the whole county. These four banners are native-grown, come from the masses, and are familiar to the broad masses. The Lankao County Party Committee grasped these living examples, publicized them widely, persisted in them, turned them into goals consciously learned by the broad masses, and effectively promoted the victorious development of the county's anti-disaster struggle.
    In any mass movement, it is necessary to implement a leadership method that combines general calls with individual guidance. Leaders should not only be good at concentrating the demands and experience of the masses and putting forward general calls, but also be good at going deep into the grassroots to conduct individual guidance in order to achieve the general calls they have put forward, in order to break through a point and gain experience. Are general calls correct? Do they need to be supplemented and revised? All must be tested through practice. The four banners erected by Comrade Jiao Yulu were concentrated from the masses; the plan formulated by Comrade Jiao Yulu to change the face of Lankao was produced on the basis of the concentrated and rich experience of the masses. To turn this plan into the action of the people of the whole county, the leadership must take the initiative and conduct individual guidance, that is, conduct what we call face-to-face leadership, active leadership, so as to obtain experience for promotion, and then concentrate and refine it to guide the overall situation. This kind of leadership from the individual to the general, and then from the general to the individual, is the most powerful leadership.
    Whether individual guidance can be truly implemented depends on whether we can truly go deep into the masses. Comrade Jiao Yulu often lived among the masses, lived among the most difficult masses, and often appeared in front of the masses when they needed him most. He was in close contact with the masses, shared weal and woe with them, and was very familiar with the demands and experience of the masses, and very familiar with the situation and laws of natural disasters. On the basis of such deep mass work, it is relatively easy to form correct general calls, and it is also relatively easy to correctly implement general calls. The fact that the natural landscape of Lankao County has undergone relatively large changes in a relatively short period of time is a living proof.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's work style and method of going deep into the masses and providing individual guidance are a mirror for our leading cadres at all levels. Some leading cadres, in their work, often issue more general calls and provide less individual guidance; they are more active among cadres and less active among the masses; they "go" to the masses more often and "come" from the masses less often. This is not in line with the tradition of the Party's mass line. Studying Comrade Jiao Yulu with the spirit of rectification, we must take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, like him, often go deep into reality, go deep into the masses, and act in accordance with the tradition of the Party's mass line.

### 最有力的领导

　　最有力的领导
    焦裕禄同志是怎样领导兰考人民进行改天换地斗争的？本报今天发表的四篇文章，提供了新的生动具体的材料。这些材料充分说明，焦裕禄同志在贯彻执行党的群众路线方面，不愧为毛泽东同志的好学生。
    毛泽东同志说过：“我们应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习，把他们的经验综合起来，成为更好的有条理的道理和办法，然后再告诉群众（宣传），并号召群众实行起来，解决群众的问题，使群众得到解放和幸福。”焦裕禄同志正是这样做的。
    兰考县人民世世代代同严重的自然灾害作斗争，积累了多种多样的经验。这些经验，散在广大群众当中。领导干部的任务是努力向群众学习，深入广大群众中去发现、集中和提高群众的经验。焦裕禄同志深入兰考广大农村，把散在广大群众中的抗灾经验集中起来，提炼为“韩村的精神，秦寨的决心，赵垛楼的干劲，双杨树的道路”，为全县人民树立了四面旗帜。这四面旗帜，是土生土长的，是来自群众的，是广大群众所熟悉的。兰考县委抓紧这些活样板，广为宣传，坚持下去，变成广大群众所自觉学习的目标，有效地推动了全县抗灾斗争的胜利发展。
    在任何群众运动中，都要实行一般号召和个别指导相结合的领导方法。领导者不但要善于集中群众的要求和经验，提出一般号召，并且要善于为实现自己提出的一般号召，深入基层，进行个别指导，以突破一点，取得经验。一般号召是不是正确？是不是需要补充和修改？都要通过实践来检验。焦裕禄同志树立的四面旗帜，是从群众中集中起来的；焦裕禄同志制订的改变兰考面貌的规划，是在集中起来的群众丰富经验基础上产生的。要把这个规划变成全县人民的行动，就要领导亲自动手，进行个别指导，也就是进行我们所说的面对面的领导、活的领导，从而取得推广的经验，再加以集中、提炼，用来指导全面。这种从个别到一般，又从一般到个别的领导，就是最有力的领导。
    能不能真正实行个别指导，关键在于能不能真正深入群众。焦裕禄同志经常生活在群众中间，生活在最困难的群众中间，经常在群众最需要的时候出现在群众面前。他和群众呼吸相通，患难与共，十分熟悉群众的要求和经验，十分熟悉自然灾害的情况和规律。在这样深厚的群众工作基础上，就比较容易形成正确的一般号召，也比较容易正确贯彻一般号召。兰考县的自然面貌，在比较短的时间内发生了比较大的变化，就是一个活生生的证明。
    焦裕禄同志这种深入群众、个别指导的工作作风和工作方法，对我们各级领导干部来说，是一面镜子。有些领导干部，在自己的工作中，往往一般号召多，个别指导少；在干部中活动多，在群众中活动少；到群众中“去”的多，从群众中“来”的少。这是不符合党的群众路线的传统的。用整风精神学习焦裕禄同志，就要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，象他那样经常深入实际，深入群众，按照党的群众路线的传统办事。
