    Xinhua News Agency, 1st - Commander Sharma of the Malayan National Liberation League delegation to China said in Beijing tonight that Southeast Asia has become the main center of the world revolutionary storm. At this stage, the Malayan people must strengthen and further develop the movement against "Malaysia" to cooperate with the Vietnamese people and the entire Southeast Asian people in the struggle against US imperialism.
    Commander Sharma held a reception at the Beijing Hotel tonight to celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the Malayan National Liberation League. Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, and heads of other Chinese people's organizations, as well as some foreign friends in Beijing, were invited to attend the reception. Chinese and foreign guests warmly wished the Malayan people continuous new victories in their anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle.
    Commander Sharma spoke first at the reception. He emphasized that as our league enters its eighteenth year, and as our armed struggle is also unfolding in its eighteenth year, the Malayan people are even more determined to wage struggle against imperialism and for freedom, independence, democracy and peace in all aspects.
    Speaking of the history of the Malayan people's anti-imperialist struggle, Sharma said that the Malayan people have learned from experience that to deal with an extremely cunning and heavily armed enemy, armed struggle must be the main form of struggle. We must unite under the leadership of the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and carry out various struggles to coordinate with the armed struggle until the enemy is completely and thoroughly defeated.
    In his speech, Sharma condemned British imperialism for carrying out plunder in Southeast Asia, and, based on its strategy east of Suez, is condoning and helping US imperialism to wage a war of aggression in Vietnam.
    He also condemned: The Khrushchev revisionists are cooperating with US imperialism and its running dogs to split the anti-imperialist forces. The Malayan people will resolutely wage struggle against modern revisionism in all fields of struggle.
    Sharma said that the Malayan people's struggle against the reactionary rule of British imperialism and its running dogs supported by the United States is just. The Chinese people and all revolutionary people in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world are fighting with us, and final victory will surely belong to us.
    Kang Yonghe, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, spoke at the reception. On behalf of the Chinese people, he paid high tribute to the Malayan people who are fighting against the reactionary rule of US and British imperialism and its running dogs and for national liberation, and wished the Malayan people continuous strengthening and development of their own forces in the new year, and more achievements in smashing the neo-colonialist product "Malaysia" and in the struggle for national liberation.
    He said that the Chinese people fully support the patriotic and just struggle of the Malayan people.
    In his speech, Kang Yonghe strongly condemned US imperialism's new crime of "resuming bombing" of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He said that the Chinese people, together with the people of the world, will continue to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against US aggression and for national salvation until final victory is achieved.
    British friend Shapiro also spoke at the reception. He represented British friends living and working in Beijing in warmly congratulating the 17th anniversary of the founding of the Malayan National Liberation League, and guaranteed to fully support the Malayan people's struggle to smash "Malaysia," and to fully support the struggle of all colonial people against British and US imperialism.

    新华社一日讯　马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团团长沙尔玛今晚在北京说，东南亚已经成为世界革命风暴的主要中心，马来亚人民在现阶段要加强并进一步发展反对“马来西亚”的运动，来配合越南人民和整个东南亚人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    沙尔玛团长为庆祝马来亚民族解放同盟成立十七周年，今晚在北京饭店举行酒会。中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志和中国其他各人民团体的负责人，在北京的一些外国朋友，应邀出席了酒会。中外人士热烈祝马来亚人民的反帝爱国斗争不断取得新的胜利。
    沙尔玛团长在酒会上首先讲话。他强调说，在我们的同盟进入它的第十八个年度，我们的武装斗争于第十八个年度中也正在开展的时候，马来亚人民更加决心在各方面进行反对帝国主义和争取自由、独立、民主与和平的斗争。
    沙尔玛在谈到马来亚人民反帝斗争的历史时说，马来亚人民从经验中认识到，对付极端狡猾和武装到牙齿的敌人，必须以武装斗争为主要的斗争形式。必须以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础，团结起来进行各种斗争来配合武装斗争，直到完全、彻底地打败敌人。
    沙尔玛在讲话中谴责英帝国主义在东南亚进行掠夺，并根据它在苏伊士以东的战略，正在纵容和帮助美帝国主义在越南进行侵略战争。
    他还谴责说：赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在同美帝国主义及其走狗搞合作来分裂反帝力量。马来亚人民将在一切斗争领域中坚决进行反对现代修正主义的斗争。
    沙尔玛说，马来亚人民反对受美国支持的英帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治的斗争是正义的。中国人民和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及全世界一切革命人民都在和我们一起战斗，最后胜利一定是属于我们的。
    中国亚非团结委员会副主席康永和在酒会上讲话，他以中国人民的名义向为反对美英帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治、为争取民族解放而斗争的马来亚人民致崇高的敬意，并祝马来亚人民在新的一年中不断壮大和发展自己的力量，在粉碎新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”和争取民族解放的斗争中获得更多的成就。
    他说，中国人民完全支持马来亚人民的爱国正义斗争。
    康永和在讲话中强烈谴责美帝国主义对越南民主共和国“恢复轰炸”的新罪行。他说，中国人民同全世界人民一道，继续坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，直到取得最后的胜利。
    英国朋友夏庇若也在酒会上讲话。他代表在北京居住和工作的英国朋友热烈祝贺马来亚民族解放同盟成立十七周年，并且保证全力支持马来亚人民为粉碎“马来西亚”的斗争，全力支持所有殖民地人民反对英、美帝国主义的斗争。
