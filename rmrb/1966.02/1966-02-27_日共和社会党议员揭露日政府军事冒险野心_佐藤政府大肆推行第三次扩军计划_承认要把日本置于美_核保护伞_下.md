　　(Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo) News: Japanese Socialist Party Diet member Yasunori Narasaki, on February 19, at a meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, revealed that the Japanese "Defense Agency" is vigorously conducting military expansion and war preparations activities according to the "Flying Dragon Plan."
　　At the meeting, Narasaki revealed a secret document drafted by the "Defense Agency," indicating that the Sato government, bowing to the United States and disregarding the strong opposition of the Japanese people and democratic forces, insisted on transporting Nike-Ajax missiles to Fukuoka Prefecture in the North Kyushu region, near China.
　　According to a February 19 report in the Yomiuri Shimbun, the Japanese "Air Self-Defense Force" currently has two Nike-Ajax missile battalions, one located near Tokyo and the other newly built in the North Kyushu region. During the "Third Military Expansion Plan" starting this year, it has been decided to build three more Hercules missile battalions, distributed in the Osaka-Kobe, Tokai, and Tohoku regions.
　　Defense Agency Director-General Ryozo Matsuno was forced to admit the existence of such a document at the meeting.
　　(Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo) Electric report: The Japanese Sato government is accelerating its arms expansion in pursuit of the war policies of the United States. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun's February 14 disclosure, the Japanese "Defense Agency" (equivalent to the Ministry of Defense) recently decided to add five "Coastal Guard Detachments" to five naval bases across the country in the Third Military Expansion Plan, which is starting early this year.
　　The five bases are Sasebo, Yokosuka, Kure, Maizuru, and Ominato. Most are located near the Korean Strait and China.
　　According to the Japanese military newspaper Asagumo, the Second Nike Missile Group, newly established in North Kyushu near China under the Second Military Expansion Plan, was officially established on February 1.
　　(Xinhua News Agency, February 25) News from Tokyo: Japanese Communist Party Senator Masao Iwama revealed at a meeting of the Senate Budget Committee on February 22 that the Sato government is plotting to place Japan under the US "nuclear umbrella," allowing American nuclear weapons to be freely transported into Japan.
　　Iwama pointed out that Japan's representative to the United Nations, Akira Matsui, said at a UN General Assembly meeting last autumn: "To protect non-nuclear countries from nuclear threats and nuclear attacks, bilateral or multilateral defense treaties should be signed." However, Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina surprisingly considered Matsui's words "very appropriate" at a Senate meeting last December.
　　Iwama pointed out that Prime Minister Sato said in the House of Representatives on January 31: "Negotiating nuclear weapons issues with the US government will not cause any trouble." At the end of last year, US Vice President Humphrey and Secretary of State Rusk said that the US government had held discussions with the Japanese government on nuclear issues.
　　Eisaku Sato and Etsusaburo Shiina were forced to admit that Japan was under US nuclear weapons protection under Iwama Masao's exposure.
　　Iwama Masao went on to point out that as long as Japan is placed under the US "nuclear umbrella," nuclear weapons will inevitably be transported into Japan. At the Japan-US "Security Consultative Committee" held last September, an agreement was already reached on the issue of US nuclear fleets entering Japanese ports. To date, nuclear submarines have entered Sasebo port eight times.
　　Iwama asked: Isn't this just another "nuclear security" system? Sato and Shiina were rendered speechless by Iwama's question.

　　日共和社会党议员揭露日政府军事冒险野心
　　佐藤政府大肆推行第三次扩军计划
　　承认要把日本置于美“核保护伞”下
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本社会党国会议员楢崎弥之助二月十九日在众议院预算委员会会议上，揭露日本“防卫厅”根据“飞龙计划”大肆进行扩军备战活动。
    楢崎在会上揭露了“防卫厅”拟定的秘密文件，表明佐藤政府屈从美国，不顾日本人民和民主力量的强烈反对，硬要把奈克—阿贾克斯式导弹运往靠近中国的北九州地区的福冈县。
    据《读卖新闻》十九日报道，日本“航空自卫队”现有两个奈克—阿贾克斯式导弹营，一个设在东京附近，一个在北九州地区刚刚建成。在今年开始的“第三次扩军计划”期间，决定再建三个赫尔克里士式导弹营，分布在大阪—神户、东海、东北三个地区。
    “防卫厅”长官松野赖三在会议上被迫承认有这样一个文件。
    据新华社东京电　日本佐藤政府追随美国的战争政策正加紧扩充军备。据《读卖新闻》十四日透露，日本“防卫厅”
  （相当于国防部）最近决定在提前从今年开始的第三次扩军计划中，给全国五个海军基地增设五个“沿海警备支队”。
    这五个基地是佐世保、横须贺、吴、舞鹤和大凑。大部分是靠近朝鲜海峡和中国的。
    另据日本军队的报纸《朝云》报道，在靠近中国的北九州，根据第二次扩军计划新设的第二奈克导弹群已经在二月一日正式建立。
    新华社二十五日讯　东京消息：日本共产党参议员岩间正男二十二日在参议院预算委员会会议上揭露佐藤政府阴谋把日本置于美国“核保护伞”之下，使美国核武器任意运进日本。
    岩间指出，日本驻联合国代表松井明去年秋天在联合国大会会议上说过：“为保护非核国家不受核威胁和核袭击，应当签订双边或多边的防御条约。”而日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎去年十二月在参议院会议上竟认为松井的话“很恰当”。
    岩间指出，佐藤首相一月三十一日在众议院说：“同美国政府商谈核武器问题决不会引起麻烦。”去年底，美国副总统汉弗莱和国务卿腊斯克曾经说，美国同日本政府就核问题进行过商谈。
    佐藤荣作和椎名悦三郎在岩间正男揭露下不得不承认，日本受美国核武器保护。
    岩间正男接着指出，只要日本被置于美国“核保护伞”之下，核武器必将运进日本。在去年九月举行的日美“安全协商委员会”已经就美国核舰队进入日本港口问题达成协议，到现在为止，核潜艇曾经八次进驻佐世保港。
    岩间问道：这难道不就是另一个“核安全”体系吗？佐藤和椎名被岩间问得张口结舌。
