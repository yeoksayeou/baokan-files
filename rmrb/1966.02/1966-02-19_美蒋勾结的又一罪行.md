    Another Crime of Collusion Between the U.S. and Chiang
    Renmin Ribao Commentator
    The "Status of Forces Agreement" for the U.S. military illegally stationed in Taiwan, signed by U.S. imperialism with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, has recently been "passed" by the Chiang gang's "Legislative Yuan." This is an important step by U.S. imperialism in its attempt to permanently occupy our territory of Taiwan and to turn Taiwan into a base for expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, and is another crime by U.S. imperialism in infringing upon our sovereignty and threatening our security. The Chinese people express great indignation at this.
    According to this "agreement," the U.S. aggressor troops can enter Taiwan at will, can use Taiwan's ground and existing facilities, and can arbitrarily delineate occupied areas. In the occupied areas, U.S. troops can arbitrarily massacre Taiwanese compatriots under the guise of "guarding," and outside the occupied areas, they can do evil under the guise of carrying out "missions." U.S. troops not only enjoy complete freedom to enter, leave, or permanently reside in Taiwan, but also enjoy privileges such as tax exemption and demanding compensation for "damages." In this way, all the criminal activities of the U.S. aggressor troops in using Taiwan to expand their war of aggression and in Taiwan have become "legal." It is very clear that this "Status of Forces Agreement" for U.S. troops in Taiwan is entirely signed to meet the needs of U.S. imperialism's aggression and to further enslave the people of Taiwan. The Chiang Kai-shek clique's signing of this "agreement" with U.S. imperialism is another serious crime of betrayal.
    At present, U.S. imperialism is shifting its strategic focus from Europe to Asia and is stepping up its military deployment in Asia. While the Johnson administration signed this "agreement" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, it openly dispatched a squadron of C-130 "Hercules" aircraft to the Kungkuan Air Force Base in Taiwan; and expanded the 13th Task Force Air Force stationed in Taiwan into the U.S. 327th Air Division. American news agencies bluntly stated that the activities of the U.S. Air Force at the Taiwan base were "supporting the Vietnam War"; Taiwan could "serve as a U.S. military base" and "serve as a staging area for U.S. troops." The U.S. imperialism's blatant use of Taiwan as an important base for expanding its war of aggression cannot but arouse serious vigilance among the Chinese people and the Asian people.
    The Chiang Kai-shek clique has long been spurned by the Chinese people. It has no right to sign any treaties with any country. Like the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek in 1954, the "Status of Forces Agreement" for U.S. troops in Taiwan, which is now signed between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, is also completely illegal and invalid, and is nothing but a piece of waste paper.
    Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. U.S. imperialism's attempt to permanently occupy Taiwan is absolutely impossible. Its use of Taiwan as a military base to expand its war of aggression against Vietnam and to carry out new military adventures in Asia will inevitably suffer more disastrous defeats and receive more severe punishment.

    美蒋勾结的又一罪行
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义同蒋介石集团非法签订的侵台美军“地位协定”，最近已由蒋帮的“立法院”“通过”。这是美帝国主义妄图永久霸占我国领土台湾，并且把台湾变为它扩大侵越战争基地的一个重要步骤，是美帝国主义侵犯我国主权、威胁我国安全的又一罪行。中国人民对此表示极大愤慨。
    按照这个“协定”，美国侵略军可以任意开进台湾，可以使用台湾的地面和现有的设备，可以任意划定占领区。美军在占领区内可以假借“警卫”之名，任意屠杀台湾同胞，在占领区外又可以假借执行“任务”之名，为非作歹。美军不仅享有进入、离开或者在台湾永久居住的完全自由，还享有免税、要求赔偿“损害”等等特权。这样一来，美国侵略军利用台湾扩大侵略战争和在台湾进行的一切犯罪活动，都变成“合法”的了。十分明显，这个侵台美军“地位协定”，完全是为了适应美帝国主义侵略需要和进一步奴役台湾人民而签订的。蒋介石集团同美帝国主义签订这个“协定”，是它卖国的又一严重罪行。
    目前，美帝国主义正在把它的战略重点从欧洲移到亚洲，加紧在亚洲进行军事部署。约翰逊政府同蒋介石集团签订这个“协定”的同时，公然派遣C—130“大力士”式飞机中队，进驻台湾的公馆空军基地；把驻在台湾的第十三特遣航空队扩大为美国第三二七空军师。美国通讯社露骨地说，美国空军在台湾基地的活动，是在“支持越南战争”；台湾可以“作为美军的作战基地”和“充当美军的集结待运地点”。美帝国主义明目张胆地把台湾作为扩大侵略战争的重要基地，不能不引起中国人民和亚洲人民的严重警惕。
    蒋介石集团早被中国人民所唾弃。它根本没有任何权力同任何国家签订任何条约。同一九五四年美蒋签订的所谓“共同防御条约”一样，现在美蒋签订的侵台美军“地位协定”，也是完全非法的，无效的，不过是一张废纸。
    台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。美帝国主义妄图永久霸占台湾，是绝对办不到的。它利用台湾作为军事基地，扩大侵略越南战争，在亚洲进行新的军事冒险，必然遭到更惨重的失败，受到更严厉的惩罚。
