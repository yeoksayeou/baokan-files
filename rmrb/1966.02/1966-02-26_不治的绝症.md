　　Incurable Disease
　　He Zhuo
　　The low morale, cowardice, and war-weariness of the U.S. invading forces in Vietnam have become a headache for the Johnson administration. The U.S. military has been constantly trying to stimulate morale by means such as increasing salaries and issuing awards, but these have consistently failed. On the South Vietnamese battlefield, the "startle disease" of American invading soldiers has become an incurable malady.
　　What is the reason for this? Are American soldiers inherently afraid of death? No, absolutely not. When the American people fight for their own interests and just causes, they are brave and tenacious. For example, in the American War of Independence, poorly armed American militiamen defeated the well-equipped British colonial army through heroic battles. At the beginning of the war, farmers who had just armed themselves in Lexington and Concord fought bloody battles, routing the fully armed and well-trained British colonial forces. Later in the war, when the situation was very unfavorable for the Americans, a small number of American troops, undeterred by danger, bravely crossed the Delaware River in secret, attacking the British troops in Trenton, finally reversing the situation and laying the foundation for victory. So, why is the situation so different on the South Vietnamese battlefield? The diaries and articles of two U.S. military officers who invaded Vietnam provide some answers to this question.
　　The Johnson administration endlessly prattles on about how the United States is waging war in South Vietnam to uphold "democracy and freedom" and to fulfill America's "sacred and inescapable obligations." More and more Americans have come to understand that these are all deceptive lies. Therefore, the anti-war movement in the United States is surging, with more and more people burning their draft cards and refusing to serve in the military. On the South Vietnamese battlefield, harsh reality even more clearly tells people how shameless Johnson's lies are. Captain Ed Boite, a company commander in the U.S. invading forces, admitted that he was engaged in murder and arson in South Vietnam and expressed his weariness of it. There must be no shortage of U.S. invading officers and soldiers who feel the same way. As long as one can distinguish right from wrong, one cannot help but see that the United States is waging a dirty war of aggression in South Vietnam, a war that not only does not serve the interests of the American people, but also harms them. How can one expect ordinary American soldiers to be willing to risk their lives for such a war and display bravery?
　　Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "Imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak because it does not have the support of the people." This fundamental weakness of imperialism is bound to be exposed particularly clearly when it wages an unjust war. The low morale of the U.S. invading forces in Vietnam and the prevalence of "startle disease," this incurable disease, is actually a reflection of the incurable disease of U.S. imperialism not receiving the support of the people.
　　The support or opposition of the people is a decisive factor in the outcome of a war. The U.S. imperialist war of aggression in Vietnam is not only strongly condemned by the people of the world but also completely unsupported by its own people. The fundamental reason why the Vietnamese people are bound to win and U.S. imperialism is bound to lose lies in this.
　　Not only that, but for the Johnson administration, there appears to be a calamity even more terrifying than the "startle disease" suffered by the U.S. invading forces in Vietnam. That is: The war of aggression in Vietnam is prompting American soldiers to gradually increase their understanding of the essence of U.S. imperialism and embark on the path of struggle against their own country's imperialism.
　　Some advanced elements among the American people see the essence of U.S. imperialism clearly, but there are still a considerable number of ordinary Americans who do not see it so clearly. The Johnson administration's gradual expansion of the war of aggression in Vietnam has played a role in promoting the political awareness of the American people. In the American people's anti-war movement, many people have linked the Vietnam War with the imperialist nature of the United States, and some have even begun to put forward the slogan "The current social system of the United States must be destroyed." And on the South Vietnamese battlefield, the cruel reality of U.S. imperialism carrying out aggression inevitably has a negative educational effect on the vast number of soldiers in the U.S. invading forces, making it easier for them to recognize the anti-people essence of U.S. imperialism. Therefore, the war of aggression in Vietnam has in fact become a political school. U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Donald Duncan, after attending this political school, resolutely refused promotion, requested retirement, and publicly published articles to expose the lies of the Johnson administration and the crimes of the U.S. invading forces in Vietnam. There is no doubt that in the future, more and more people in the U.S. invading forces will awaken like Duncan and more vigorously throw themselves into the struggle against their own country's imperialism.
　　It is not uncommon for historical facts to show that imperialism drives its own country's soldiers to be cannon fodder for its unjust wars, but the result is that it drives these soldiers onto the path of struggle to eliminate it. In the First World War, many of the Russian soldiers who were driven to the battlefield by the Tsarist government later became revolutionary fighters who overthrew the Tsarist regime. U.S. imperialism's forcing American soldiers to risk their lives for the war of aggression in Vietnam will inevitably end up "lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own feet." It will accelerate the development of its incurable disease, making it terminally ill, and finally lead to its death.

　　不治的绝症
　　何卓
    侵越美军士气低落，胆怯厌战，这已经成为约翰逊政府伤透脑筋的事情。美国军方不断用加饷、发奖等手段，企图刺激士气，但是始终不能奏效。在南越战场上，美国侵略军士兵的“吃惊病”已经成为无药可医的顽症了。
    原因何在呢？难道美国的士兵生来就都是贪生怕死的吗？不，决不是如此。美国人民在为了自己的利益和正义的事业而进行战斗的时候，是勇敢顽强的。例如，在美国独立战争中，武器简陋的美国民兵就曾用英勇的战斗打败了装备精良的英国殖民军队。在战争一开始的时候，来克星屯和康克得两地刚刚武装起来的农民，浴血奋战，把全副武装、训练有素的英国殖民军打得落花流水。在战争后期，当战局对美国十分不利的时候，少数美国部队不避艰险，勇敢地偷渡德拉瓦尔河，袭击特仑屯的英军，终于扭转局面而奠定了胜利的基础。那末，在南越战场上，情况为什么如此截然不同？这里发表的两名侵越美军军官的日记和文章，对这个问题提供了一些答案。
    约翰逊政府喋喋不休地说，美国在南越进行战争是为了维护什么“民主和自由”，是为了履行什么美国“不能推卸的神圣义务”。越来越多的美国人，已经懂得了这些都是骗人的鬼话。因此，在美国国内反战运动风起云涌，烧征兵证的、拒服兵役的人越来越多。在南越战场上，严酷的现实更是清楚地告诉人们，约翰逊的谎言是多么无耻。美国侵略军的上尉连长埃德·博伊特承认，他在南越所干的勾当是杀人放火，并且对此表示厌倦。在侵越美军官兵中有同感的，当不乏人。只要是能够分辨是非的人，都不能不看到：美国在南越进行的是一场肮脏的侵略战争，这场战争不仅不是为了维护美国人民的利益，而且是损害了美国人民的利益。怎么能够设想，美国普通士兵会为着这样一场战争甘心卖命，而表现出勇敢精神来呢？
    毛泽东同志曾经指出：“帝国主义是外强中干的，因为它没有人民的支持。”帝国主义的这种根本弱点，在它进行一场不义之战时就势必暴露得格外明显。侵越美军士气低落、“吃惊病”流行这种不治的绝症，实际上就是美帝国主义得不到人民支持的这个不治的绝症的一个反映。
    人心的向背，对于战争的胜负是一个起决定性作用的因素。美帝国主义的侵越战争不仅受到世界人民的强烈谴责，而且完全得不到本国人民的支持。越南人民必胜，美帝国主义必败，根本原因就在于此。
    不仅如此，对于约翰逊政府来说，看来还有着一个比侵越美军患“吃惊病”更为可怕的灾难。这就是：侵越战争正在促使美国士兵逐步提高对美帝国主义的本质的认识，走上反对本国帝国主义的斗争道路。
    对于美帝国主义的本质，美国人民中的一些先进分子是看得清楚的，也还有相当数量的美国普通人不是看得那么清楚。约翰逊政府逐步扩大侵越战争，已经起了促使美国人民提高政治认识的作用。在美国人民的反战运动中，不少人把越南战争同美国的帝国主义本质联系起来，甚至有人开始提出了“必须摧毁美国目前的社会制度”的口号。而在南越战场上，美帝国主义进行侵略的残酷现实，不可避免地要对侵越美军中广大的士兵起一种反面教育的作用，使他们更加容易认识到美帝国主义的反人民的本质。因此，侵越战争事实成了一所政治学校。美国退伍军士长唐纳德·邓肯就是上了这个政治学校以后，断然拒绝升官，要求退伍，并且公开发表文章来揭露约翰逊政府的谎言和侵越美军的罪行。毫无疑问，今后在侵越美军中必将有越来越多的人和邓肯一样有所觉醒，并且更加有力地投入反对本国帝国主义的斗争。
    帝国主义驱使本国士兵去为它进行的不义之战当炮灰，结果反而驱使这些士兵走上消灭它的斗争道路，这样的历史事实并不罕见。在第一次世界大战中，被沙皇政府赶上战场去打仗的俄国士兵，不少人在以后不是变成了推翻沙皇统治的革命战士吗？美帝国主义强迫美国士兵为侵越战争卖命，必然也要落得个“搬起石头打自己的脚”的结果。使它所患的不治的绝症加速发展、病入膏肓，而最后走上死亡的道路。
