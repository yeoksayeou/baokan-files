    Cloves Transform into Gold for Whom?
    Anyone who visits Zanzibar almost certainly wants to see the clove plantations here or buy some clove-made souvenirs, because Zanzibar is the world-famous "Clove Island."

    Red Flower Buds
    Cloves are small peach-red flower buds picked from clove trees, which turn reddish-brown after being dried. They are a precious spice used in food, cigarettes, and candies, and can be used to manufacture high-end cosmetics, and also have important uses in medicine.

    During the golden season for Zanzibar farmers to harvest cloves, we visited Pemba Island, the main clove-producing area. Looking down from the plane, Pemba Island is a lush green, like a magnificent emerald floating on a vast expanse of blue waves. Stepping onto this beautiful island, one is immersed in the fragrant atmosphere of cloves, the rich aroma intoxicating. The car drove along winding, undulating roads, flanked by endless clove forests, with lush foliage and verdant greenery.

    Harvesting cloves is the busiest season for the island's farmers. Early in the morning, diligent farmers, men, women, young and old, carrying palm leaf baskets, flock to the clove plantations in groups, picking bundles of flower buds in the dense shade of the branches. In the villages, every household spreads out grass mats in front of their doors or on the concrete drying platforms of the plantations, facing the sun to dry the cloves. At night, lights twinkle in the fields, and farmers gather under the lights, some twisting the fresh buds off the stems, others selecting the dried buds and removing impurities. In front of the warehouses of the state-owned trading company's collection stations, it is bustling every day, as people bring bags and cartloads of cloves to sell to the company. The picking, destemming, sun-drying, and sorting of cloves are all done by hand. Every clove is imbued with the farmers' hard work.

    A Page of Blood and Tears
    Large-scale clove cultivation in Zanzibar has only occurred in the last century and a half. In the early 19th century, Arab landlords in Zanzibar began to import clove seedlings from Mauritius. In the first half of the 19th century, Sultan Sayyid, who then ruled Zanzibar and the East African coast, saw that cloves were profitable and forced the islanders to cultivate them widely, even announcing that anyone with a coconut tree must plant three clove trees, or face confiscation of their land. In this way, clove production gradually developed in Zanzibar.

    For many years, the clove trees became a money tree for a small group of exploiters. These exploiters squandered the money extracted from blood and sweat. A friend on Pemba Island told the story of a plantation owner who made a fortune in a year when clove prices soared. Not knowing where to spend the money, he actually used twenty-shilling notes to light his cigarettes. The vast majority of working people, under heavy exploitation, lived in extreme poverty.

    After British colonialists invaded Zanzibar, in order to control Zanzibar's clove production and sales, thereby controlling Zanzibar's economic lifeline, they enacted a decree in 1927 establishing the "Clove Producers Association." It effectively completely controlled Zanzibar's clove production and sales, extracting huge profits for the British Empire. British colonialists also forbade Zanzibar from reaching bilateral trade arrangements with other clove-importing countries. As a result, the international clove market gradually shrank.

    New Life
    On January 12, 1964, Zanzibar erupted in armed revolution, ending the era of colonialism's exploitation and plunder of the Zanzibari working people. Shortly after the revolution, the famous "March 8th Declaration" was announced, declaring the nationalization of all land. On April 24 of the same year, Zanzibar and Tanganyika formed the United Republic of Tanzania. In the past two years, the Tanzanian government has systematically confiscated more than 650 plantations from large landowners in Zanzibar and began implementing the distribution of plantations from June last year. At the same time, the Zanzibar government also announced on October 8, 1964, the nationalization of the "Clove Producers Association," reorganizing it into the "Zanzibar State Trading Corporation," responsible for the purchase and export of cloves. A worker told reporters with joy, "We have been hoping that one day we would take back our wealth from the exploiters, and that day has finally arrived." Not long ago, the reporter visited the state-owned trading corporation again. When the person in charge of the company talked about the achievements made after the company was nationalized, he said, "The Zanzibar revolution returned this organization to the people and put clove production on a new path of development."

### 丁香为谁变黄金

    丁香为谁变黄金
    凡是来到桑给巴尔访问的人，几乎都想看看这里的丁香园或买些丁香制成的纪念品。因为桑给巴尔是举世闻名的“丁香之岛”。红色的花蕾
    丁香是从丁香树上采摘下来的桃红色小花蕾，晒干后呈红棕色。它是用作食品、卷烟、糖果的一种名贵的香料，并可制造高级化妆品，在医药上也有重要用途。
    正当桑给巴尔农民采摘丁香的黄金季节，我们访问了丁香的主要产地——奔巴岛。从飞机上望下去，奔巴岛一片葱绿，好象万顷碧波上飘浮着一块瑰丽的翡翠。踏上这个美丽的岛屿，就处在丁香芬芳的氛围中，馥郁的香气令人欲醉。汽车驶过弯曲起伏的公路，两旁是绵延不尽的丁香林，枝叶繁茂，郁郁苍苍。
    收获丁香是岛上农民最繁忙的季节。清晨，勤劳的农民，男女老少，手提棕榈叶篓子，成群结队涌进丁香园，在繁枝浓荫中，采摘一束束的花蕾。村子里，家家户户迎着阳光在门前铺下草席或在种植园水泥晒台上，翻晒丁香。入夜，四野灯火闪烁，农民们聚集在灯光下，有的把鲜蕾从花梗上拧下来，有的挑选干蕾，清除杂质。国营贸易公司各收购站库房前终日熙熙攘攘，人们送来一袋袋、一车车的丁香售给公司。丁香从采摘、脱梗、曝晒、挑选都是用手工进行的。每一粒丁香上都凝结着农民的辛勤劳动。一页血泪史桑给巴尔大量种植丁香还是近一个半世纪以来的事。十九世纪初，桑给巴尔的阿拉伯地主开始从毛里求斯岛引进丁香幼苗，十九世纪前半叶，当时统治桑给巴尔和东非沿岸的苏丹王赛义德见丁香有利可图，便强迫岛上的人们广泛种植，还宣布每有一棵椰子树的人就必须种三棵丁香树，违者没收土地。这样，丁香生产便在桑给巴尔逐步发展起来。
    许多年来，丁香树变成一小撮剥削者的摇钱树。这些剥削者用压榨来的血汗钱尽情挥霍。奔巴岛一位朋友讲过这样的故事：岛上有一个种植园主，在丁香涨价的一年发了横财，无处花钱，竟用二十先令一张的钞票点火吸烟。广大的劳动人民在重重剥削下则处于极端贫困的地步。
    英国殖民者入侵桑给巴尔以后，为了控制桑给巴尔的丁香生产和销售，从而控制桑给巴尔经济命脉，在一九二七年颁布法令成立“丁香生产者协会”。它实际上完全控制了桑给巴尔丁香的生产和销售，为大英帝国榨取了大量的利润。英国殖民者还不许桑给巴尔同其他进口丁香的国家达成双边贸易安排。因此丁香国际市场日渐萎缩。新生的日子
    一九六四年一月十二日，桑给巴尔爆发了武装革命，结束了桑给巴尔劳动人民受殖民主义剥削和掠夺的时代。革命后不久公布了著名的“三月八日宣言”，宣布将全国土地收归国有。同年四月二十四日桑给巴尔与坦噶尼喀组成坦桑尼亚联合共和国。两年来，坦桑尼亚政府已经在桑给巴尔有步骤地没收了大地主的六百五十多个种植园，并从去年六月开始实行种植园的分配。同时桑给巴尔政府还在一九六四年十月八日宣布把“丁香生产者协会”收归国有，改组成为“桑给巴尔国营贸易公司”，负责丁香的收购和出口。一位工人满怀喜悦地向记者说，“我们一直在盼望有一天我们要把自己的财富从剥削者手里夺回来，这一天终于来到了”。不久前记者再度访问了这家国营贸易公司，公司负责人在谈到公司国有化后取得的成绩时说，“桑给巴尔革命使这个组织回到人民手中，也使丁香生产走上了一条新的发展道路”。
