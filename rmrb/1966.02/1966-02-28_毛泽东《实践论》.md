　　Mao Zedong's "On Practice"
　　"The processes of arising, developing, and perishing in social practice are infinite, and the processes of arising, developing, and perishing in human knowledge are also infinite. Based on certain ideas, theories, plans, and programs to engage in the practice of transforming objective reality, again and again, people's understanding of objective reality deepens again and again. The changing movement of the objective real world never ends, and people's understanding of truth in practice never ends. Marxism-Leninism has not ended truth, but is constantly opening up the path to understanding truth in practice."

　　毛泽东《实践论》
　　“社会实践中的发生、发展和消灭的过程是无穷的，人的认识的发生、发展和消灭的过程也是无穷的。根据于一定的思想、理论、计划、方案以从事于变革客观现实的实践，一次又一次地向前，人们对于客观现实的认识也就一次又一次地深化。客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结。马克思列宁主义并没有结束真理，而是在实践中不断地开辟认识真理的道路。”
