    The dark and thin Jiao Yulu, leaning against the door, staring blankly at the sky-covering wind and snow, this scene is forever etched in people's memories.

    Jiao Yulu's eyes were so affectionate and so firm. What was he doing? His heart flew to Qinzhai, flew to Zhangzhuang, flew to Zhaoduolou, flew to Lao Hanling, his heart was touring the entire county of Lankao. He saw many old poor peasants struggling against the new difficulties brought about by this boundless snow. He felt the chill in the thatched houses and livestock sheds next to the old course of the Yellow River, assailing him in waves. He heard in his ears the great voice of Chairman Mao instructing Communist Party members to "sincerely seek the interests of the masses, solve the problems of production and life of the masses, the problem of salt, the problem of rice, the problem of housing, the problem of clothing, the problem of childbirth, solve all the problems of the masses." Jiao Yulu acted swiftly and immediately issued specific instructions to the communes on caring for the lives and production of the masses in snowy weather. After a sleepless night, he led the county committee cadres to the forefront of the struggle against the wind and snow.

    The Communist Party's deep class feelings for the proletariat and poor and lower-middle peasants are vividly and richly displayed to everyone through Jiao Yulu's actions.

    An old poor peasant once said to Jiao Yulu: "Your heart is close to mine, and my heart is close to yours. We are of one mind." This sentence actually answers two questions: What standard should the class feelings of Communist Party members reach? What role can this kind of class feeling play?

    The standard of Jiao Yulu's style of class feeling is to keep heart-to-heart with the masses. First, this class feeling is not abstract and general, but concrete and flesh and blood. Jiao Yulu, in the wind and snow, was concerned not only about the 360,000 people of Lankao County, but also about the poor and lower-middle peasants in this family and that household in Qinzhai and Zhaoduolou. His feelings for the suffering of the working people were the most real and profound. Therefore, second, this class feeling is the strongest and most heartfelt. How deeply Jiao Yulu loved the poor and lower-middle peasants! A raging fire burned in his heart, wanting to warm his class brothers; nothing could stop him from expressing this great class love. Third, this class feeling is not empty rhetoric of enthusiasm but is embodied in a series of practical and concrete actions and implemented in work.

    "Exchange hearts for hearts," "hearts linked together." Jiao Yulu kept his heart close to the masses, and the masses also kept their hearts close to Jiao Yulu, close to the Communist Party, close to our great leader Chairman Mao. The class feelings of the Communist Party aroused the love of the proletariat, poor and lower-middle peasants, and other working people for the revolution, "regarding the revolution as their life, regarding the revolution as their banner of supreme glory" (Mao Zedong: *Concern Ourselves with the Well-Being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work*). Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, 650 million Chinese hearts are tightly connected with each other, becoming an incomparably huge force that shakes mountains and rivers.

    同群众心贴心
    四赞焦裕禄
    于廷
    又黑又瘦的焦裕禄，倚在门前，望着蔽天盖地的风雪发呆，这一个场面，永远铭刻在人们的记忆当中了。
    焦裕禄的眼神，是那么深情，又是那么坚定，他在做什么呢？他的心飞到秦寨去了，飞到张庄去了，飞到赵垛楼去了，飞到老韩陵去了，他的心在兰考全县的大地上巡行。他看见许许多多老贫农在同这场漫天大雪带来的新困难作斗争。他感到黄河故道旁边草屋里和牲口棚里的寒意，向他身上一阵阵袭来。他耳边响起了毛主席教导共产党员要“真心实意地为群众谋利益，解决群众的生产和生活的问题，盐的问题，米的问题，房子的问题，衣的问题，生小孩子的问题，解决群众的一切问题”的伟大声音。焦裕禄迅速行动起来，立即给公社下达在雪天里关心群众生活和生产的具体指示。在彻夜未眠之后，又率领县委的干部到同风雪斗争的最前线去了。
    共产党人对无产阶级和贫下中农的深厚的阶级感情，通过焦裕禄的行动，非常生动非常丰富地显示在一切人面前。
    一个老贫农曾经对焦裕禄说：“你的心贴着我，我的心贴着你，咱俩可是一个心思。”这句话实际上解答了两个问题：共产党人的阶级感情应该达到什么标准？这种阶级感情能够产生什么作用？
    焦裕禄式的阶级感情，其标准就是把心贴着群众。第一，这种阶级感情不是抽象的、一般的，而是具体的、有血有肉的。焦裕禄在风雪中关注的，在通宵不眠中焦虑的，既是兰考县三十六万人民，又是秦寨、赵垛楼这家那户的贫下中农。他对劳动人民的疾苦感受是最实在最深切的。因此，第二，这种阶级感情是最强烈的，是全身心的。焦裕禄对贫下中农是多么一往情深啊！他的心里燃起一团熊熊烈火，要去温暖自己的阶级兄弟，什么也不能阻碍他去表达这种伟大的阶级之爱。第三，这种阶级感情不是空泛的热情言词，而是体现在一系列切实具体的行动上的，是在工作上落实了的。
    “将心换心”，“心心相印”。焦裕禄把心贴着群众，群众也把心贴着焦裕禄，贴着共产党，贴着我们伟大的领袖毛主席。共产党人的阶级感情，激起了无产阶级、贫下中农和其他劳动人民对革命的热爱，“把革命当作他们的生命，把革命当作他们无上光荣的旗帜”（毛泽东：《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》）。在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，中国六亿五千万颗心互相紧紧贴在一起，成为震撼山河的无比巨大的力量。
