    A Model for High-Yield Rice in Mountainous Areas
    —A Startup Record in the Mountainous Areas of Xingning, Guangdong
    Editor's Note: In China's grain production, rice production occupies a pivotal position. The perennial planting area of rice accounts for about 23 percent of the planting area of grain crops, and its yield accounts for about 42 percent of the total grain output. Striving for continuous increases in rice production is an important task in China's national economic construction.
    The development of rice production in China is uneven and unstable. In about three-quarters of the rice-producing areas, rice yields are still unstable or low, or stable but not high. Bringing the rice production in these areas up to par will fundamentally change the face of China's rice production. Is this possible? The facts in Xingning County show that this is entirely possible. As for those areas that have basically achieved stable and high yields, there is still great potential to be tapped in rice production. As long as we carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution like the Dazhai people and do our work in a down-to-earth manner, low-yield areas can become high-yield areas, and high-yield areas can become even higher-yield areas. The materials published here on striving for high rice yields in several different regions provide us with some good experiences.

    The revolutionary deeds of the people of Xingning County in transforming mountains and rivers with great aspirations and lofty ambitions have spread throughout Guangdong Province.
    Six hundred thousand people in Xingning, enduring great hardships and hard work for the revolution, shoulder the heavy responsibility of building a new socialist countryside, and have followed the path of self-reliance for a full ten years.
    In these ten years, the people of Xingning have built reservoirs, chiseled stone to build canals, and constructed more than 10,000 large and small water conservancy projects in their poor mountainous hometown, so that 90 percent of the cultivated land in this place, which was once plagued by "major disasters with heavy rains, minor disasters with light rains, and drought disasters after ten days without rain," has water conservancy facilities, of which 80 percent have been built into drought and flood-protected, stable, high-yield farmland, basically realizing the county's water conservancy.
    In these ten years, the people of Xingning have built 60,000 gully dams and afforested more than 500,000 mu on bare hills, so that the soil erosion area of more than 200 square kilometers has been initially controlled.
    In these ten years, the people of Xingning, with the spirit of continuous revolution, have carried out agricultural technical reforms to change the low-yield situation. Grain output has gradually increased from a low level of three to four hundred jin, and last year the average per-mu yield of 350,000 mu of rice exceeded one thousand jin, making it a mountainous county in China with a per-mu rice yield of one thousand jin.

    Starting a Business Through Self-Reliance
    Xingning County is located in the mountains of northeastern Guangdong. Due to the plunder of the reactionary rulers in the past, the cultivated land was prone to both drought and flood, and the yield was very low.
    After liberation, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xingning County overthrew the landlord and rich peasant classes, shaking off the first disaster—class oppression. Then, they resolved to conquer the poor mountains and bad waters and shake off the second disaster—natural disasters.
    To develop production, we must change the production conditions and carry out technical reforms. The first thing to do is to harness water and control mountains. After a period of practice and systematic investigation, the Xingning County Party Committee formulated a plan for the comprehensive construction of the mountainous area of Xingning in the autumn of 1956.
    To tame water and drought disasters, we must thoroughly control the Ning River, a major project. We must build reservoirs on thirty-one tributaries, and then build canals across the mountains and ridges, chisel stone through the mountains, and divert water to irrigate the farmland on both sides of the Ning River, turning water hazards into water conservancy.
    In Xingning, this is an unprecedented huge project. It inspires the people of the whole county. As soon as the autumn harvest and winter planting of 1956 ended, more than 100,000 migrant workers shouldered hoes and iron shovels and went to the water conservancy construction site.
    The construction of the Heshui Reservoir is a key project for thoroughly controlling the Ning River and must be built before the arrival of the flood season next year. This is a tough battle.
    More than 8,000 members, led by secretaries of party committees at all levels, came to the construction site. At this time, it was the eleventh and twelfth lunar months, the cold wind was piercing, and the ground was frozen and hard, but people were energetic and worked up a sweat. In particular, Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and youth shock brigade members stepped forward and shouldered the heaviest burdens in the most difficult times and places of the project.
    After the water conservancy project to thoroughly control the Ning River was launched, new difficulties were placed before us.
    Building water conservancy requires a large amount of cement and steel. Where does it come from? The County Party Committee held meetings again and again to study various opinions in detail, and finally came to the conclusion: Find a way yourself, we cannot exert more effort for the country, nor can we increase the country's burden!
    According to the design, the construction of the Heshui Reservoir requires 1,700 tons of cement and 40 tons of steel bars, not counting the materials for the steel plate gates. The construction cost is 2.59 million yuan. Where does so much funding and equipment come from!
    The masses said: "Poor people have poor ideas." A method of replacing steel bars with stone masonry was proposed. The County Party Committee actively supported the masses' rationalization proposals and encouraged everyone to carry out technical revolution. A self-reliant project design was born. The Xingning people, who dared to endure hardship and work hard, transported large stones weighing several hundred kilograms from the deep mountains to the construction site and built the reservoir's flood discharge structures. This not only saved tens of thousands of yuan in investment for the project, but more importantly, it set up a banner of self-reliance and hard work for the people of the whole county.
    However, cement is still indispensable. The County Party Committee decided to run a cement plant by itself. Just do it. Soon, the Xingning Cement Plant was built, and batches of cement produced were transported to the water conservancy construction site.
    Year after year, the people of Xingning buried themselves in hard work for the revolution and for the construction of mountainous areas. In ten years, the people of Xingning moved 44.8 million cubic meters of earth and stone. The total investment in water conservancy projects was 32.41 million yuan, of which the investment from the special commissioner's office and the province only accounted for 12.7 percent, and the rest was money saved by the county, communes, and brigades.

    Controlling Mountains as well as Harnessing Water
    If we only control water but not mountains, soil erosion cannot be controlled, and mountain ponds and reservoirs will gradually be silted up. Therefore, the people of Xingning came down from the water conservancy construction site and went to the mountains.
    In the years before and after communization, leading cadres of the County Party Committee squatted in the Gepao Brigade of Daping Commune, which had the most serious soil erosion, to lead the masses in controlling landslides. People spent a lot of labor planting trees and afforesting the mountains. However, just as the saplings were growing, a rainstorm swept mud and sand and buried the saplings. The second year, summing up the lessons learned, people climbed the landslide and built a large number of fish-scale pits and earth gully dams. However, in a rainstorm, more than half of the more than 100 gully dams collapsed. Some people were discouraged and frustrated. However, the County Party Committee summed up the lessons learned from the failures and saw the victory.
    The cadres of the County Party Committee went deep into the masses, held "Zhuge Liang meetings," carefully analyzed the reasons for the failure of mountain control, and looked for new methods. At the same time, they educated the members: We must be in the deep mountains, have the whole country in mind, and everyone should contribute to building their hometown into a new socialist countryside. The members were excited to hear this. This time, they opened drainage ditches at the top of the mountain to block floods, cut collapse slopes in the middle of the mountain, built gully dams at the foot of the mountain to block collapse ridges, built sand reservoirs to store mud and sand, and comprehensively planted trees and afforested to carry out comprehensive management. Finally, the collapse ridge was subdued. Now, Xingning County has controlled soil erosion on 230 square kilometers of collapsed mountains and bare ridges, accounting for 50 percent of the county's total soil erosion area.

    Climbing New Peaks
    With the change of water conservancy conditions, grain output has increased year by year, and the lives of the members have gradually improved. Some people began to feel content. However, the County Party Committee was considering a new issue: Can the output of mountainous areas exceed that of plains? Can low-yield Xingning catch up with high-yield Chaozhou and Shantou?
    In 1961, the County Party Committee put this issue up for discussion. Everyone believed that the water conservancy conditions were good, the members were energetic, and the situation was very good. To strive for high yields, we must take the road of agricultural technical revolution, learn from the advanced experience of high-yield areas, and learn scientific farming methods.
    The secretary of the County Party Committee led a group of cadres, youths, and old farmers to the Chaozhou-Shantou Plain. After walking for several days, they saw patches of high-yield fields everywhere. Fields planted using scientific methods had no low-yield fields, and the short, sturdy rice plants bore large and long ears of rice.
    The revolutionary spirit and cultivation techniques of the Chaozhou-Shantou people inspired people's thinking. Many old farmers understood: Farming for oneself, hoping to maintain production every year; farming for the revolution, to achieve high yields and even higher yields. This requires learning from scratch!
    They invited old farmers from the Chaozhou-Shantou Plain as consultants, introduced high-yield fine varieties from other places, and planted various experimental fields.
    In 1964, the agricultural technical reform of planting high-yield fields extensively yielded results. In this year, early rice comprehensively promoted short-stalked high-yield fine varieties, and late rice also widely used fine varieties. The members learned the experience of Chaozhou-Shantou and promoted advanced field management techniques, so that the average per-mu yield of 350,000 mu of rice fields in the county reached 890 jin.
    Last year, the people of the county, with the spirit of continuous revolution, further summarized the high-yield experience of 1964, conscientiously transformed 110,000 mu of low-yield fields, and a great situation of low-yield transforming into high-yield and high-yield becoming even higher-yield appeared.

    Cadres Take the Lead in Hard Work
    How was Xingning's victory in high grain yield achieved?
    The cadres of Xingning said: This is the result of the conscious masses listening to the Party, adhering to self-reliance, and continuous revolution.
    The masses of Xingning said: This is because the cadres and Communist Party members at all levels in the county who are loyal to the revolutionary cause have taken the lead for us and set an example.
    The cadres' evaluation is fair. The masses' evaluation is also fair.
    The cadres of Xingning County have inherited the Party's glorious revolutionary traditions and, in the struggle to transform nature, have always endured hardship first, using their own actions to influence the masses and educate the masses.
    For ten years, they have tried to save on non-productive construction expenditures as much as possible. Many organs in the county did not have houses to work in, and cadres lacked houses to live in, and it was necessary to build some. The county finance department raised the money to build houses and waited for the County Party Committee to approve the start of construction. The County Party Committee considered it again and again and still did not approve it, handing the matter over to the cadres of various organs for discussion. After a discussion, the organs that wanted to build houses no longer requested it. They said: We are still afraid that there is not enough money for production and construction, our houses, let's talk about it later! Therefore, they repaired a few dilapidated temples by themselves and made them cadres' dormitories. Even now, the offices and cadres' dormitories of many organs are located in ancestral halls and ancient temples.
    The revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance of the cadres of Xingning County has become an example for the masses of the whole county and the most persuasive mobilization, inspiring the people of the whole county to advance bravely.
                      ×××
    The people of Xingning have only used a short ten years to bring about significant changes in the poor mountainous area. However, the output of each commune and brigade is unbalanced. The per-mu yield of high-yield brigades has reached 1,700 jin; the per-mu yield of low-yield brigades is only about 700 jin. In the same brigade, under roughly the same farming conditions, the output is also unbalanced. After conducting in-depth investigations and analyses in the Dongfeng, Jinxing, Gepao and other brigades, the County Party Committee found the main reason for the unbalanced output, that is, the groundwater level in low-yield fields is high, affecting the normal growth of rice. Therefore, another large-scale farmland capital construction to generally lower the groundwater level has been brewing and is preparing to take action.

    山区水稻高产的一个榜样
    ——广东兴宁山区创业记
    编者按　在我国的粮食生产中，水稻生产占有举足轻重的地位。水稻常年播种面积，约占粮食作物播种面积的百分之二十三，它的产量约占粮食总产量的百分之四十二。力争水稻持续增产，是我国国民经济建设中的一项重要任务。
    我国水稻生产的发展是不平衡、不稳定的。大约四分之三的水稻产区，水稻的产量仍然不稳不高或稳而不高。使这类地区的水稻生产赶上来，就会从根本上改变我国水稻生产的面貌。这是否可能呢？兴宁县的事实，说明这是完全可能的。至于那些基本上已经达到稳产高产的地区，水稻生产仍然有很大潜力可挖。只要象大寨人那样发扬不断革命的精神，踏踏实实地做好工作，低产地区就可以高产，高产地区就可以更高产。这里发表的几个不同地区争取水稻高产的材料，为我们提供了一些好经验。
    兴宁县人民怀着豪情壮志改造山河的革命事迹，传遍了广东省。
    六十万兴宁人，为革命吃大苦，耐大劳，挑起建设社会主义新农村的重担，沿着自力更生的道路，走了整十年。
    这十年，兴宁人在穷山恶水的家乡，搬山筑水库，凿石修渠道，兴建了一万多座大小水利工程，使这个“大雨大灾，小雨小灾，十日无雨闹旱灾”的地方，百分之九十的耕地有了水利设备，其中百分之八十已建成为旱涝保收、稳产高产农田，基本实现了全县水利化。
    这十年，兴宁人在光山秃岭上筑谷坊六万座，造林五十多万亩，使二百多平方公里的水土流失面积得到初步治理。
    这十年，兴宁人以不断革命的精神，进行农业技术改革，改变低产面貌。粮食产量从三四百斤的低水平逐年提高，去年三十五万亩水稻平均亩产量超过千斤，成为我国的一个山区水稻亩产千斤县。
    自力更生创业
    兴宁县处在广东东北部群山之中。由于过去反动统治者的掠夺，耕地易旱又易涝，产量很低。
    解放了，兴宁县广大贫农下中农打倒了地主富农阶级，摆脱了第一重灾难——阶级压迫。接着，他们立下决心，征服穷山恶水，摆脱第二重灾难——自然灾害。
    要发展生产，得改变生产条件，进行技术改革。首先是要治水治山。兴宁县委经过一段时期的实践和系统调查，在一九五六年秋天制定出了全面建设兴宁山区的规划。
    要驯服水旱灾害，就必须根治宁江这项工程。要在三十一条支流修筑水库，然后盘山越岭，凿石穿山，修筑渠道，引水灌溉宁江两岸的农田，化水害为水利。
    在兴宁，这是没有先例的巨大工程。它振奋着全县人民。一九五六年秋收冬种一结束，十几万民工就扛起锄头铁锨上了水利工地。
    兴建合水水库，是根治宁江的关键工程，而且要抢在来年洪水季节到来之前筑好。这是一场攻坚的硬仗。
    八千多名社员，在各级党委书记带领下，来到了工地。这时是十冬腊月，寒风刺骨，地冻土坚，但人们精神奋发，干得满身热汗。特别是共产党员、共青团员和青年突击队员，在工程最艰难的时候，最艰难的地方，挺身而出，挑起了最重的担子。
    根治宁江的水利工程展开以后，新的困难摆到了面前。
    修水利，需要大批水泥和钢材，从那里来呢？县委会为这事，一次又一次地开会，详细研究了各种意见，最后作出结论：自己想办法，我们不能为国家出更大的力，可也不能增加国家的负担！
    修建合水水库，根据设计，需要水泥一千七百吨，钢筋四十吨，还没计算钢板闸门的用料。一算工程费，二百五十九万元。那里来的这样多资金器材啊！
    群众说：“我们穷人有穷主意”。一个用石砌代替钢筋混凝土的办法提出来了。县委会积极支持群众的合理化建议，鼓励大家进行技术革命。一个自力更生的工程设计诞生了。敢于吃苦耐劳的兴宁人，把几百斤重一块的大石头，由深山运到了工地，砌成了水库的泄洪建筑物。这不仅为工程节约了几十万元的投资，更可贵的是，给全县人民树立了自力更生、艰苦创业的大旗。
    不过，水泥总还是少不了的。县委会就决定自己办个水泥厂。说干就干。不久，兴宁水泥厂建成了，生产的水泥一批一批运到了水利建设工地。
    一年又一年，兴宁人为革命，为建设山区，埋头苦干。十年时间，兴宁人搬动了四千四百八十万立方米土石。全部水利工程投资三千二百四十一万元，其中专署和省的投资只占百分之十二点七，其余都是县、公社、大队节省下来的钱。
    治水也要治山
    治水不治山，水土流失不能控制，山塘水库会逐渐被淤塞。因此，兴宁人从水利工地上下来，又上了山头。
    公社化前后几年，县委领导干部在水土流失最严重的大坪公社鸽池大队蹲点，领导群众治崩山。人们花了大量的劳动，在山上植树造林。可是，树苗刚长出来，一场暴雨，山洪带着泥沙把树苗埋没了。第二年，总结了教训，人们爬上崩山，修筑了大量鱼鳞坑和土谷坊。可是，一场暴雨，一百多座谷坊又垮了大半。有些人灰了心，泄了气。可是县委却从失败中总结了教训，看到了胜利。
    县委的干部们深入群众，开“诸葛亮会”，认真分析了治山失败的原因，寻找新办法。同时教育社员：要身在深山，胸怀全国，人人出力把自己的家乡建成社会主义新农村。社员们一听，劲头上来了。这一回，他们在山顶开天沟拦洪水，在山腰削崩坡，在山下筑谷坊堵崩岗，建沙库蓄泥沙，全面植树造林，进行综合治理。终于把崩岗制服了。如今，兴宁县已经在二百三十平方公里的崩山秃岭控制了水土流失，占全县水土流失总面积的百分之五十。
    攀登新的高峰
    随着水利条件的改变，粮食产量逐年提高，社员生活逐步改善。有些人开始心满意足起来。县委会却在考虑着一个新的问题：山区的产量，能不能超过平原？低产的兴宁，能不能赶上高产的潮汕？
    一九六一年，县委会把这个问题提出来讨论。大家认为，水利条件好，社员劲头大，形势好得很。要争取高产，就要走农业技术革命的道路，学习高产地区的先进经验，学习科学的种田方法。
    县委书记领着一批干部、青年、老农到了潮汕平原。走了好几天，看到的片片都是高产田。用科学方法种的田，没一丘低产，矮墩墩的稻子，结着又大又长的稻穗。
    潮汕人的革命精神和栽培技术，启发了人们的思想。许多老农明白了：为自己种田，年年望保产；为革命种田，要高产再高产。这要从头学起啊！
    他们从潮汕平原请来老农当顾问，从外地引来高产良种，种起了各种各样的试验田。
    一九六四年，大种高产田的农业技术改革结了果。这一年，早稻全面推广矮秆高产良种，晚稻也大面积采用良种，社员们大学潮汕经验，推广先进的田间管理技术，使全县三十五万亩水稻田平均亩产八百九十斤。
    去年，全县人民以不断革命的精神，进一步总结了一九六四年的高产经验，认真地改造了十一万亩低产田，出现了低产变高产，高产更高产的大好形势。
    干部带头苦干
    兴宁粮食高产的胜利是怎样取得的呢？
    兴宁的干部说：这是觉悟了的群众听党的话，坚持自力更生，不断革命的结果。
    兴宁的群众说：这是全县忠于革命事业的各级干部和共产党员为我们带了头，树立了榜样。
    干部的评价是公正的。群众的评价也是公正的。
    兴宁县的干部继承了党的光荣的革命传统，在改造自然的斗争中，处处吃苦在前，用自己的行动去影响群众，教育群众。
    十年来，他们尽量节省非生产性建设的开支。县里不少机关没房子办公，干部缺房子住，建一些本来也需要。县财政部门把建房子的钱筹出来了，等着县委批准动工。县委又考虑再三，还是没有批，把这事交给各机关干部去讨论。一讨论，想建房子的机关不再要求了。他们说：搞生产建设还怕钱不够，我们的房子，以后再说吧！于是，他们自己动手，把几个破烂的庙堂修了修，做了干部的宿舍。一直到现在，还有不少机关的办公室和干部宿舍设在祠堂、古庙里。
    兴宁县干部艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，成为全县群众的榜样和最有说服力量的动员，鼓舞全县人民，勇往直前。
                      ×××
    兴宁人只用了短暂的十年，就使贫困的山区发生了显著变化。可是，各公社大队的产量却不平衡，高产的大队，亩产量到了一千七百斤；低产的大队，亩产量却只有七百斤左右。同一个大队里，在耕作条件大体相同的情况下，产量也不平衡。县委在东风、金星、鸽池等大队进行深入调查分析以后，把产量不平衡的主要原因找到了，原来是低产田的地下水位高，影响了水稻的正常生长。因此，普遍降低地下水位的又一次大规模的农田基本建设已经酝酿成熟，准备行动了。
