    When a salesperson in our company sold eggs, they passed off inferior ones as superior ones and overcharged by more than twenty yuan. Our organization formed a work team to visit over two thousand eight hundred households to return the money to the customers. This not only salvaged our political reputation but also educated all the employees.
    In our food industry, the majority of employees can distinguish between socialist and capitalist business practices. However, a few employees have been tainted by some bad habits from the old society and sometimes consciously or unconsciously bring capitalist business practices into the enterprise, such as short-weighting and selling third-grade meat at second-grade prices. Regarding this type of problem, I think this way: we are a socialist enterprise, so we must operate according to socialist ideology; if we engage in capitalist practices, the socialist enterprise risks degeneration. This is a matter of principle, a struggle between two roads, and absolutely cannot be relaxed.
    Last August, one Sunday morning, a salesperson at the Friendship Store, seeing many people buying eggs, intentionally passed off inferior eggs as superior ones and raised the prices. They raised the price of processed preserved eggs from five jiao per jin to seven jiao five fen, and the price of processed eggs from three jiao per jin to five jiao, overcharging a total of twenty-two yuan, three jiao, and nine fen. After I learned about this situation, I promptly convened a general branch committee meeting for a special discussion and decided to return all the improperly collected money to compensate the customers' economic losses, salvage our political reputation, and educate all the employees. At the time, some comrades said that the investigation was necessary, but it was impossible to return the overcharged money. I believed that this was not just a matter of whether or not to return a few dozen yuan, but a matter of whether or not to maintain the reputation of a socialist enterprise, a matter of whether or not to adhere to the socialist direction of operation. After some discussion, we reached a consensus and immediately formed a work team of fifteen people, led by the deputy secretary of the general branch, Comrade Zhu Guocai, to carry out the visiting work.
    It was indeed very difficult to return the overcharged money to the customers one by one without addresses or names. However, everyone recognized the political significance of this work and therefore was very enthusiastic. In two days, they visited a total of eight neighborhood committees nearby, totaling more than two thousand eight hundred households, from which they found one hundred and seven households who had bought eggs that day and returned twenty-one yuan and nine fen. The remaining one yuan and three jiao was estimated to have been bought by passersby, so we posted a large-character poster at the entrance to notify them to come and collect it.
    When the comrades of the work team went from door to door, upstairs and downstairs, to inquire, they were warmly received by the residents. Some were eating and quickly put down their bowls to pour tea and offer cigarettes, while others helped to inquire and provide clues. An old woman surnamed Min said, "The new society is different from the old society. In the past, capitalists racked their brains to make money. Today, you personally deliver even a jiao or two that was overcharged, not being careless about even a fen. Only socialism can do this." Yao, an old woman living in the Electric Power Building, specially returned the two jiao that had been refunded to her to the meat group the day after the refund, saying, "I misremembered the date and shouldn't have accepted the refund. The public shouldn't overcharge, and I shouldn't wrongly ask for money." This action salvaged the negative impact, strengthened the relationship with the masses, and also educated all the employees, making everyone clearly recognize that socialist commerce serves the people and therefore must conduct business honestly.

    坚持原则  不能含糊
    有个营业员卖蛋的时候以次充优，多收了二十多元。我们组织工作组走访了两千八百多户，退钱给买主。既挽回了政治影响，又教育了全体职工。
    在我们食品行业里，大多数职工都能划清社会主义和资本主义经营作风的界限。但是，也有少数职工沾染了一些旧社会的恶习，有时自觉不自觉地把资本主义经营作风带进企业，如短秤少两，三级肉卖二级价等。对于这类问题，我是这样想的：我们是社会主义企业，就得按社会主义思想去经营；如果搞资本主义那一套，社会主义企业就有变质的危险。这是个原则问题，是两条道路的斗争，绝对不能放松。
    去年八月一个星期天的早晨，友谊商店有个营业员，看到买鸡蛋的人很多，就有意地以次充优，抬价出售，将处理皮蛋由每斤五角抬为七角五分，将处理鸡蛋由每斤三角抬为五角，共多收货款二十二元三角九分。我知道这个情况以后，就及时召开总支委员会进行专题讨论，决定全部退回不该收的货款，以补偿顾客的经济损失，挽回政治影响，教育全体职工。当时，有的同志说检查是应该的，但多收的钱没办法退。我认为，这不是个几十元钱要不要退的问题，而是一个要不要社会主义企业信誉的问题，是一个要不要坚持社会主义经营方向的问题。经过一番讨论，认识统一了，随即组成一个十五人的工作组，由总支副书记祝国才同志带领，开展了走访工作。
    在一无地址、二无姓名的情况下，要把多收的货款一一退给顾客，困难确实很大。但大家认识到这一工作的政治意义，因此热情很高。两天共走访了邻近的八个居民委员会，计两千八百多户，从中找到了那天买鸡蛋的一百零七户，退还二十一元零九分。下余一元三角，估计是过路顾客买去了，因此又在门口张贴大字报，通知他们来领取。
    当工作组的同志沿门挨户、楼上楼下询问的时候，受到居民的热情接待。有的正在吃饭，忙放下饭碗给我们倒茶拿烟，有的还代为询问，提供线索。一位姓闵的老大娘说：“新社会跟旧社会就是不同。过去资本家挖空心思赚钱，今天卖蛋多收了一两角钱，你们就亲自送上门，一分钱都不马虎。这只有社会主义才做得到。”住在电业大楼的姚老大娘，在退款的第二天，又特地把退给她的二角钱送回肉食组，她说：“我把日子记错了，不该收你们退的钱。公家不多收，我也不错要。”这样做，挽回了不良影响，密切了跟群众的关系，也教育了全体职工，使大家明确认识到社会主义商业是为人民服务的，因此必须诚实经商。
