    Following US Aggression Policy Reaps Bitter Fruit
    Thailand's Serious Financial Deficit

    Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 8th: Thailand, in coordination with the US imperialist plot to expand aggression, has intensified its preparations for war, substantially increased its expenditures, and its national finances are facing an increasingly serious deficit.

    Thai Finance Minister Serm recently stated that due to huge military expenditures, a supplementary budget is needed this year. According to reports, the Thai Ministry of Defense's 1966 budget (from October 1965 to September 1966) has already reached 2,167 million baht, more than three times the amount in 1951. The fiscal budget for this year already has a deficit of 2.2 billion baht.

    In addition to adopting tax increases, the Thanom regime in Thailand also announced at the beginning of this year that it would issue 1 billion baht in public bonds in order to squeeze the people's wealth to be used for expanding the military and preparing for war.

    The United States is also plundering materials in Thailand to support its war of aggression in Vietnam. According to reports, last year, the United States forced Thailand to sell 50,000 tons of rice to the South Vietnamese puppet regime at low prices. The United States also purchased 32,000 tons of sugar at reduced prices and shipped it to South Vietnam.

    In order to build airports, strategic highways, and other military facilities in Thailand, the United States has also seized a large amount of land from Thai farmers. In 1964 alone, 110,000 rai (each rai equals 2.4 mu) of land belonging to 3,000 farmers in northeastern Thailand was seized by US imperialism.

    追随美国侵略政策自食恶果
    泰国财政入不敷出情况严重
    新华社八日讯　曼谷消息：泰国由于配合美帝国主义扩大侵略的阴谋加紧备战，大幅度地增加了开支，国家财政入不敷出的情况越来越严重。
    泰国财政部长森最近说，由于军费开支庞大，今年要追加预算。据报道，泰国国防部一九六六年度（从一九六五年十月到一九六六年九月）开支预算已经达到了二十一亿六千七百多万铢，比一九五一年增加三倍多。本年度的财政预算已经有二十二亿铢的赤字。
    泰国他侬政权除了采取增税的措施外，还在今年初宣布要发行十亿铢公债，以便搜刮民脂民膏供扩军备战用。
    美国还在泰国搜刮物资，来支援它的侵越战争。据报道，去年，美国迫使泰国以低廉价格售给南越傀儡政权五万吨大米。美国还压价收购了三万二千吨糖运往南越。
    美国为了在泰国修筑飞机场、战略公路和其它军事设施，还霸占了泰国农民的大量土地。仅在一九六四年，泰国东北部就有三千农户的十一万莱（每莱合二·四市亩）土地被美帝国主义占去。
