   Even If We Have to Pull and Carry by Hand, We Must Go Onward
   Instructor Liu Zhengkui
    There are no cranes or tractors, and the equipment cannot be transported to the well site. What should we do to start drilling as soon as possible?
    Zhang Shilin said, "When Wang Jinxi's team first arrived in Daqing for installation, they didn't have cranes or tractors. They installed the drilling rig by pulling and carrying it by hand. When they were drilling and there was no water, Wang the 'Iron Man' said we should even urinate if we have to! That's a good example. If Wang the 'Iron Man' could do it, why can't we? He's an Iron Man, we should become Steel Men!"
    We used the method of pulling and carrying by hand, and after several days of arduous struggle, we completed the installation work. The towering derrick stands on the prairie, demonstrating the working class's iron will and inexhaustible strength!

   人拉肩扛也要上
   指导员　刘正魁
    没有吊车、拖拉机，设备运不到井场，为了早日开钻，怎么办？
    张石林说：“王进喜队刚到大庆安装时没有吊车、拖拉机，他们是用人拉手抬把钻机安装好的。他们打钻没有水，王铁人说尿尿也要打。这比方好。王铁人能干，我们为什么不能干？他是铁人，我们还要当钢人！”
    我们就是用人拉肩扛的办法，经过几天的艰苦战斗，完成了安装工作的。高高的井架，站立在草原上，它显示了我们工人阶级钢铁般的意志和无穷无尽的力量！
