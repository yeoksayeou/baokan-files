　　Good at Concentrating the Wisdom of the Masses
　　Comrade Jiao Yulu, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, insisted on the leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses." This is something I must learn well.
    In order to completely change the face of Lankao, Comrade Jiao Yulu persisted in implementing the working method of the mass line taught by Chairman Mao, relied closely on the masses, and carried out an unyielding struggle against waterlogging, wind, sand, and saline-alkali land. He gathered together the valuable experiences of the masses in their struggle against natural disasters, little by little, turning them into the common wealth of the entire county and a powerful weapon for overcoming disasters. This leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses," concentrating it, and persisting in it, is worth my learning well.
    Using Comrade Jiao Yulu's thorough revolutionary spirit as a mirror, I have found many gaps in my thinking and work style, etc., and the gap in revolutionary leadership methods is even greater. Our county also has many advanced models like Hancun, Qinzai, Zhao Duolou, and Shuang Yangshu, which are self-reliant and strive for progress. The 38th Brigade is a relatively prominent one. The people of the 38th Brigade listen to the Party, listen to Chairman Mao, dare to struggle, dare to win, and dare to revolutionize poverty. Relying on their own hands, after ten years of hard work, they built a relatively complete irrigation and drainage system in the historical context of "seven droughts, eight floods, and nine harvests," basically eliminating the threat of drought and flood. Grain and cotton production have steadily increased. In 1965, the average grain yield per mu was 504 jin, more than six times that of the early days of liberation in 1949, and more than 900 mu of cotton also broke through the hurdle of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, ten times that of the early days of liberation.
    However, the experience of the 38th Brigade has not been quickly promoted and transformed into the production level of the entire county. The fundamental reason for this situation is that the county party committee has not truly learned Mao Zedong Thought as Comrade Jiao Yulu did and lacks a thorough view of serving the people; it has not started from the most fundamental desire of the people to change production conditions and improve production levels, as Comrade Jiao Yulu did. We do not have sufficient understanding and importance for advanced things and the wisdom and creativity of the masses. In promoting the experience of the 38th Brigade, we cannot highlight the great revolutionary ideal of the 38th Brigade to be self-reliant and transform the world. When promoting advanced experiences, there are often more general calls and fewer individual guidance. We have not accurately grasped the lively ideas that have emerged in various places in learning from the experience of the 38th Brigade, and the solutions to problems lack pertinence.
    In order to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, complete the important tasks entrusted to us by the Party and the people, and change the face of Nanyang County as soon as possible, the county party committee has decided: first, to learn Mao Zedong's works with class feelings like Comrade Jiao Yulu, especially myself, I must take the lead in learning well so that Mao Zedong Thought first takes root in my mind. Taking the county party committee as the core, launch a high tide of studying Mao Zedong's works throughout the county, so that the broad masses of cadres and the masses can consciously read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. Second, following Chairman Mao's teaching that politics is the commander and the soul, conduct a large-scale debate throughout the county on the topics of why to learn from "38," whether "38" can be learned, and how to learn from "38"; we must highlight politics in all our work and learn to correctly handle the relationship between politics and production, technology, and business. Third, resolutely implement the typical demonstration method of one point leading to many points and many points promoting the overall situation. Taking the 38th Brigade as a model, rationally deploy points, link up areas, and expand the original twelve models determined by the county party committee to promote the 38th Brigade to seventy-seven, vigorously carry out the mass movement of learning "38" people, building "38" fields, and catching up with "38" production by comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing, and constantly summarize the experience in promotion.

### 善于集中群众的智慧

　　善于集中群众的智慧
　　焦裕禄同志遵照毛主席的教导，坚持从群众中来到群众中去的领导方法，这是我要很好学习的。
    焦裕禄同志为了彻底改变兰考面貌，他坚持贯彻执行了毛主席教导的群众路线的工作方法，紧紧依靠群众，同内涝、风沙、盐碱进行了不屈不挠的斗争。他把群众同自然灾害作斗争的宝贵经验一点一滴地集中起来，成为全县人民的共同财富，成为战胜灾害的有力武器。这种从群众中来到群众中去，集中起来坚持下去的领导方法，是值得我很好学习的。
    以焦裕禄同志的彻底革命精神为镜子，我找出了思想、作风等方面的很多差距，在革命的领导方法方面差距更大。我县也有不少象韩村、秦寨、赵垛楼、双杨树那样的自力更生、奋发图强的先进典型，三八大队就是比较突出的一个。三八大队是全县的农业先进单位。这个大队的人民，听党的话，听毛主席的话，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，敢于革一穷二白的命，凭自己的双手，经过十年苦干实干，在历史上“七旱八涝九不收”的情况下，建成了一套比较完整的排灌系统，基本上解除了旱涝灾害的威胁，粮、棉产量稳定增长。一九六五年粮食平均亩产五百零四斤，为解放初期一九四九年的六倍多，九百多亩棉花也闯过了亩产百斤皮棉关，为解放初期的十倍。
    但是，三八大队的经验，却未能迅速推广，变为全县的生产水平。为什么出现这种情况，根本原因是县委没有象焦裕禄同志那样把毛泽东思想真正学到手，缺乏彻底地为人民服务的观点；没有象焦裕禄同志那样，从人民群众迫切要求改变生产条件、提高生产水平这个最根本的愿望出发。我们对先进事物和群众的智慧、创造，认识不足，重视不够，在推广三八大队经验中，不能把三八大队自力更生、改天换地的远大革命理想突出出来。在推广先进经验时，也往往是一般号召多，个别指导少，对各地学习三八大队经验中出现的活思想，没有抓准，解决问题缺乏针对性。
    为了向焦裕禄同志学习，完成党与人民对我们的重托，尽快地改变南阳县的面貌，县委决定：第一，要象焦裕禄同志那样，带着阶级感情学习毛主席著作，尤其是我个人，一定要带头学好，使毛主席思想首先在我头脑扎根。以县委为核心，在全县范围内掀起一个学习毛主席著作的高潮，让广大干部、群众都能够自觉地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事。第二，遵循毛主席提出的政治是统帅、是灵魂的教导，在全县范围内就为什么要学“三八”、能不能学“三八”、怎样学“三八”为题，进行大辩论；要在一切工作中突出政治，学会正确处理政治和生产、技术、业务的关系。第三，坚决实行一点带多点、多点推动全面的典型示范的方法，以三八大队为样板，合理布点，挂钩连片，并把县委原确定的十二个推广三八大队的样板扩大到七十七个，大力开展学“三八”人，建“三八”田、赶“三八”产的比学赶帮超群众运动，并不断总结推广中的经验。
