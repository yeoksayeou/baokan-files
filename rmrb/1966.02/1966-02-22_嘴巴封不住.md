    The "Hindustan Times" revealed that Humphrey presented three conditions to the Indian government for continuing "US aid" and had already received satisfactory answers. One of the conditions was: to stop public criticism of the United States' policies in Southeast Asia.
    The US policy of aggression against Vietnam has been strongly condemned worldwide, making the Johnson administration feel difficult to cope with. Therefore, Humphrey took advantage of the Indian government begging for "US aid" and put forward the condition of "stopping criticism." However, even if the Indian government readily agrees, how can it seal the mouths of the Indian people? In fact, this despicable practice of the United States can only arouse new condemnation from the Indian people.

    嘴巴封不住
    《印度斯坦时报》透露，汉弗莱向印度政府提出了继续提供“美援”的三项条件，并且已经得到了满意的答复。条件之一是：制止公众批评美国在东南亚的政策。
    美国侵越政策受到全世界的强烈谴责，使约翰逊政府感到应付为难。因此，汉弗莱乘印度政府乞讨“美援”之机，提出了“制止批评”这个条件。但是，尽管印度政府一口应承，它又怎能封得住印度人民的嘴巴呢？事实上，美国这种卑劣的做法只能引起印度人民新的谴责。
