    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 5th Dispatch: The debate and disputes within the U.S. ruling clique surrounding the Vietnam War are intensifying. At a public hearing held by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 4th, some senators, disregarding Johnson's suppression, continued to attack Johnson's policies. They subjected Bell, the head of the U.S. "Foreign Aid" program, who attended the hearing, to "four hours of intense questioning."
    Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright, in his speech, expressed doubt about the war costs announced by the U.S. government, pointing out that the war in South Vietnam had already cost the U.S. $15.8 billion in 1965. He said that the U.S. now has to pay "a very high price" to "kill each person" in the war in South Vietnam. The financial aid that the U.S. gives to the Saigon puppets "is widely embezzled by Saigon government officials." Fulbright pointed out that in the coming months, as the U.S. government "gradually escalates" the war, the costs will also "increase day by day." He said that this war "has gradually escalated far beyond past estimates."
    Fulbright demanded that the U.S. government provide evidence to show that the Saigon puppet regime "is supported by the people" and to prove that "the territory controlled by the Viet Cong is less than it was a year, two years, or three years ago."
    Fulbright's questioning left Bell in an embarrassing position. When Fulbright asked Bell, "Do you say that the situation is a little stronger now than it was a year ago?" Bell admitted that the U.S. is currently in a very difficult situation in South Vietnam. He said that in rural areas, the U.S. "foreign aid program" "has not made sufficient progress in the past few years," and even in Saigon, the U.S.-puppet troops are vulnerable to "attacks."
    Fulbright also attacked again that day that the U.S. invasion of Vietnam had no "legal basis." He said, "I find it difficult to find a legal obligation through a treaty," and "I am not convinced that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization can be said to be the source of this obligation." Fulbright said that he regretted his action in August 1964 in supporting Congress in passing a resolution supporting President Johnson after the Gulf of Tonkin incident. "I played a role in this that I am not at all proud of" with regard to the U.S. Congress supporting that resolution.
    The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's hearing was originally intended for McNamara and Wheeler to attend. However, with Johnson's support, both McNamara and Wheeler refused to attend the meeting to answer questions, citing that testifying in an open meeting was "not in the public interest." McNamara and Wheeler's decision to evade questioning made some senators very dissatisfied. Senator Morse said that he did not intend to "yield" to McNamara's wishes. As a protest, he announced that he would not participate in future secret meetings to question government witnesses about the policies that "led us down the path of war."

    侵越战争惨败使美国统治集团内部争吵激烈
    富布赖特指责政府把大量美元付诸东流，麦克纳马拉不敢出席参院会议回答质问
    据新华社五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国统治集团内部围绕侵越战争而展开的辩论和争吵正在越演越烈。在四日举行的参议院外交委员会的公开作证会上，一些参议员不顾约翰逊的压制，继续对约翰逊的政策进行攻击。他们对出席作证的美国“对外援助”计划负责人贝尔“进行了四小时紧张的质问”。
    外交委员会主席富布赖特在发言时对美国政府宣布的侵越战费表示怀疑，指出一九六五年南越战争已经使美国花掉了一百五十八亿美元。他说，美国现在在南越战争中“每杀死一个人”就得付出“非常之高的代价”。美国给西贡傀儡的财政援助“被西贡政府人士广泛地贪污了”。富布赖特指出，在今后几个月，随着美国政府把战争“逐步升级”，费用也将“日益增加”。他说，这个战争“已经逐步升级到远远超过过去估计的地步。”
    富布赖特要求美国政府拿出证据来表明西贡伪政权是“得到人民支持”的并证明“越共控制的领土比一年、二年或三年前为少”。
    富布赖特的质问使贝尔狼狈不堪。当富布赖特质问贝尔“你说现在局势比一年前强了一点吗？”时，贝尔承认，美国目前在南越的处境实在困难得很。他说，在农村里，美国的“援外计划”“在过去几年内都没有取得足够的进展”，甚至在西贡，美伪军也容易受到“攻击”。
    富布赖特这一天还再次攻击美国侵越战争没有“法律基础”。他说，“我觉得很难通过一个条约来找到合法的义务”，“把东南亚条约组织说成是这种义务的根源是不能使我信服的。”富布赖特说，他后悔他在一九六四年八月支持国会在东京湾事件之后通过支持约翰逊总统的那项决议的行动。对于美国国会支持了那项决议，“我在其中起了我完全不引以自豪的作用”。
    参议院外交委员会的作证会原来是要麦克纳马拉和惠勒出席的。但是在约翰逊的支持下，麦克纳马拉和惠勒都借口在公开会议上作证“不符合公众利益”，拒绝出席会议回答问题。麦克纳马拉和惠勒这个逃避受质问的决定使一些参议员十分不满。参议员莫尔斯说，他不打算向麦克纳马拉的愿望
  “屈服”。为了表示抗议，他宣布将不参加以后的秘密会议向政府的证人询问关于“引导我们在战争的道路上走下去”的政策。
