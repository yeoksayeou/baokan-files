    Advancing Towards the Depth and Breadth of Production
    ——Introducing the Rural Sideline Products Hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition Center
    Editor's Note: The thirty-five typical units for developing rural sideline production exhibited at the Agricultural Exhibition Hall use rich materials to prove that, regardless of whether they are mountainous, plain, hilly, lakeside, or coastal areas, the potential for sideline production is very great, and sideline production is very promising. The experiences of these units will help people broaden their horizons and will help those who originally thought that their area could not develop sideline production to liberate their minds in a big way.
    Currently, both agricultural and sideline production are in excellent situations. However, from a national perspective, sideline production is still a relatively weak link. Due to the continuous development of agriculture, developing sideline production has become even more favorable. As long as we highlight politics, liberate our minds, and make full use of various favorable conditions, it is entirely possible to make sideline production faster and better. If sideline production improves, it will, in turn, promote greater agricultural development. Agriculture and sideline production promote each other, and the entire rural economy will develop more vigorously. While firmly grasping the development of agricultural production, grasping the development of sideline production is a problem that needs to be highly valued in all localities.
    On the square of the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall, there is a constant flow of traffic and people. The audience, who had just seen the National Dazhai-style Agricultural Typical Exhibition a few days ago, has not yet calmed down from their excitement, and today they have come to the Rural Sideline Products Hall with great joy.
    Mountains, Waters, Grasses, and Trees are All Wealth
    Walking into the central hall of the Rural Sideline Products Hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall, one is greeted by a huge quotation screen with red background and gold letters, which quotes Chairman Mao's annotation to the article "Surplus Labor Found a Way Out" in the book *Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside*: "Socialism not only liberated the laborers and means of production from the old society, but also liberated the vast natural world that could not be utilized by the old society. The people have unlimited creativity. They can organize and advance towards all places and departments where they can exert their strength, advance towards the depth and breadth of production, and create more and more welfare undertakings for themselves." Every sentence and every word here shines with insightful brilliance and gives people tremendous strength. The deeds of the thirty-five advanced units from all over the country that are exhibited in the exhibition hall, which developed rural sideline production, and the colorful and dazzling sideline products, vividly embody the brilliance, correctness, and greatness of Chairman Mao's above-mentioned instructions. In recent years, the vast number of cadres and members of the people's communes in our country have been following Chairman Mao's teachings, enabling the vigorous development of rural sideline production in our country.
    In the east hall of the exhibition hall, a "Schematic Diagram of Major Production Areas of Major Sideline Products in the Country" stands out prominently. It comprehensively demonstrates that our country has a vast territory and rich resources, and rural sideline production has broad development prospects. From the foot of the Tianshan Mountains to the coast of the East China Sea, from the area between the White Mountains and the Black Water to the tropical treasure island of Hainan, every mountain, every river, every grass, and every tree contains inexhaustible sideline resources.
    The five comprehensive display platforms in the hall display traditional Chinese medicinal materials, wild animals, dried and fresh fruits, native industrial raw materials, rural waste materials, and daily miscellaneous items. They further present the rich and diverse sideline products of our country to the audience in a visual way. Just take Chinese medicinal materials, for example. Valuable ones include ginseng and deer antlers, common ones include licorice and dried tangerine peel, and strange ones include whole scorpions and centipedes. There are no less than two thousand kinds of various shapes and colors. Every year, Chinese farmers earn several hundred million yuan just from planting and collecting medicinal materials. Our country's wild animal resources are also very rich. Large ones include tigers, pythons, and swans, and small ones include sables, muskrats, and buntings, almost all of which are treasures. There are more than eighteen hundred kinds of such birds and beasts throughout the country.
    From the display platforms, people can recognize the huge potential of rural sideline production in our country. Cocklebur is a wild plant that grows all over the mountains and fields north of the Yangtze River in our country. In the eyes of many people, it is even less valuable than "chicken feathers and garlic peels." However, the exhibited materials prove that it is a wild oil material with a high oil content and a good raw material for making paint and soap. It is worth noting that the current harvesting volume of cocklebur only accounts for a few percent of the harvestable volume. If the harvesting volume can be increased, it can not only increase the production of grease and high-quality cake fertilizer for the country, but also increase the income of members in the producing areas. Let's look at rosin again. Rosin is refined from the oil of pine trees and can be produced in many places across the country. And it is a very important industrial raw material. Making one ton of paper requires ten to fifteen kilograms of rosin; making ten thousand matches requires one thousand two hundred kilograms of rosin; the production of paint, soap, and insecticides also requires rosin. This shows that developing the sideline of collecting pine resin is very important and promising.
    The vigorous development of socialist industrial construction in our country and the continuous improvement of the level of scientific research have also opened up new fields for rural sideline production in our country. The exhibited materials show that rural sideline production is linked to urban industry, and it has new vitality. Soapberry is a leguminous tree that grows on sunny village edges and is found almost everywhere in our country. Rural people have always used it to wash clothes. In recent years, with the birth of a new type of textile industry, soapberry has suddenly become much more valuable. People use soapberry kernels to extract soap gum, which can replace an imported gum for the textile printing and dyeing industry. If more purchases can be increased in the future, farmers in the producing areas can increase their income and save a lot of foreign exchange for the country. This is just one of many examples.
    In recent years, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, people's communes in various places have conscientiously implemented the policy of "taking agriculture as the main task, using sideline to support agriculture, and comprehensive management," and while developing agricultural production, they have made full use of abundant resources and actively developed sideline production according to local conditions. Now, rural sideline production in our country has eleven major categories, including planting, breeding, textile, collection, fishing, hunting, processing, workshops, kiln firing, transportation, and accumulation, with as many as several thousand varieties. In the exhibition hall, people can see many charts similar to the following:
    ——A chart showing that the output value of rural sideline production in our country has increased to about one-third of the total output value of agriculture and sideline production;
    ——A chart showing that the social purchase amount of rural sideline products in our country accounts for about 40% of the total social purchase amount of agricultural and sideline products;
    All of this gives the impression that rural sideline production in our country has occupied an important position in the national economy. Developing rural sideline production can comprehensively utilize rural manpower and material resources, increase wealth for society, increase funds and accumulation for agriculture, increase income for members, provide raw materials for industry, and also serve exports. Vigorously developing rural sideline production is a major issue related to further developing agricultural production, consolidating the collective economy, improving people's lives, and accelerating socialist construction.
    Agriculture and Sideline Promote Each Other
    In the development of rural sideline production, the relationship between agriculture and sideline is a major issue. The materials of various typical units exhibited in the Rural Sideline Products Hall eloquently prove that as long as we act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions and handle it well, agriculture and sideline can promote each other. From here, the audience can see that all units that have developed sideline production well are those who, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, are good at relying on the wisdom and strength of the masses, and through practice, solve contradictions, developing both agriculture and sideline production.
    The process of developing sideline production in Jiading County, a suburb of Shanghai, prominently reflects the dialectical relationship between agriculture and sideline as mutual conditions and mutual promotion. After grain production in Jiading County developed to a certain level, production stagnated due to lack of fertilizer and funds. In 1958, when the county party committee proposed developing sideline production, many people believed that Jiading "has no mountains and no water," and there were not many avenues for sideline production, and not much profit to be made; some people also said: "It is difficult to catch two fish with both hands." They opposed agriculture and sideline, only seeing the contradictory side and not the unified side. The county party committee analyzed the characteristics of Jiading being located in the suburbs of a city, and proposed that sideline production should prioritize pig raising, develop the breeding industry, drive general sideline production with backbone sideline production, and drive individual sideline production with collective sideline production. This mobilized the enthusiasm of commune members to develop sideline production.
    In order to provide enough pig feed, in addition to growing feed fields well, the people of Jiading tried their best to use small rivers and ponds to grow aquatic feed, so that all 30,000 mu of water surface in the county were fully utilized. They processed the stalks and husks of rice, wheat, beans, and rapeseed into feed on the spot, which drove the sideline production of agricultural and sideline product processing and workshops. They transported lees, leftovers, and swill from urban factories as feed, and short-distance transportation also developed. They also used pig sheds to raise sheep and rabbits, and used pig manure to grow mushrooms, which promoted other sideline production. Now Jiading County has a total of ten major categories and more than 120 items of sideline production. In 1963, the total output value of sideline production in the county accounted for 31.3% of the total output value of agriculture and sideline production, an increase of 163% compared with 1957. In 1964, the total output value of sideline production increased by 48% compared with 1963, and the proportion of the total income of agriculture and sideline production also rose to 35%. These changes specifically reflect the huge pace of people's commune collective production marching towards depth and breadth.
    With the development of sideline production, the conditions for developing agriculture have become even better. With more pigs, the amount of fertilizer used for agriculture has also increased accordingly. The development of sideline production has continuously increased the accumulation of the collective economy of the people's commune, promoted the "four modernizations" of agriculture, and promoted agricultural production increase. In 1965, the average yield of grain per mu in Jiading County was 1,190 jin, an increase of approximately 90% compared with 1957; the average yield of cotton per mu was 120 jin, an increase of nearly two times compared with 1957.
    The increase in agricultural production has provided conditions for the further development of sideline production. With more grain, there is more abundant feed. With more public accumulation, the degree of "four modernizations" is constantly improving. Now the machine-cultivated area in the county has reached 82% of the total cultivated area. The threshing of rice and wheat has been fully realized through mechanization and electrification. In this way, more labor can be organized to invest in sideline production.
    Of course, in the development of sideline production, we must adhere to the policy of "taking agriculture as the main task, using sideline to support agriculture, and comprehensive management," otherwise not only will agriculture be squeezed out, but sideline itself will not be developed. The deeds of Xinglong County, Hebei Province, give great inspiration in this regard.
    Xinglong is located in the Yanshan Mountains outside the ancient Great Wall, and is a mountainous area with "nine parts mountains, half a part water, and half a part farmland." Here, under the ravages of the "three-all" policy of the Japanese puppets, 60% of the county's area was reduced to a no-man's land, and the economic foundation of agriculture and sideline production was severely damaged. After liberation, the Xinglong County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China initially encountered the contradiction between agriculture and sideline production when leading the masses to develop production. At that time, the county party committee believed that Xinglong had high mountains and steep slopes, narrow rivers and thin land, and the focus of production development should be placed on the "nine" in the "nine mountains," ignoring the fundamental principle that "diversified management" must "take grain as the key link." As a result, sideline production embarked on a path of abnormal development. Planting chestnuts and walnuts was originally a good thing, but planting them next to cultivated land, where the trees grew tall and shaded the land, affected grain production. "Small summer harvest" and "small autumn harvest" were originally good things, but if they were not arranged well, they would "resist shoulders" with agriculture, causing a "double delay." This situation aroused the attention of the county party committee, and they re-recognized and handled the relationship between agricultural and sideline production. They said: To develop mountain production, grain is the key link, and forestry is also very important; with the development of forestry, grain can be produced in high yield, and diversified management can have a fundamental basis. Since 1958, the county has advocated fruit trees on the mountains and resolutely does not compete with grain for land. In the labor arrangement for agricultural and sideline production, implement an "eight-two split." In terms of time arrangement, grain comes first, sideline production is carried out on a small scale during the busy farming season, and sideline production is carried out on a large scale during the slack farming season, so as to achieve "no loss of both" and "double harvest." Now, the county's diversified management projects have developed into 14 major categories and more than 500 varieties. In 1965, the income from diversified management accounted for 60% of the total output value of agriculture and sideline production, an increase of nine times compared with the early days of liberation. Since 1958, the county's diversified management production has provided more than 37 million yuan in funds for agriculture, greatly enhancing the ability of agriculture to expand reproduction. In 1965, the county's average grain yield per mu achieved the target stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program" ahead of schedule.
    With revolutionary spirit and a dialectical materialist point of view, sideline production can be developed everywhere in the motherland.
    Developing in Class Struggle
    Among these advanced typical examples exhibited in the Rural Sideline Products Hall, although the natural conditions are different, the factors of manpower and material resources are different, and the management projects are different, there is one thing in common in their experience, that is, taking class struggle as the key link, establishing a sideline team with poor and lower-middle peasants as the backbone, and adhering to the socialist orientation of sideline production.
    Qixia County, Shandong Province, which is famous for its comprehensive development of mountain sideline production through hard work, has an image in its exhibited materials that particularly attracts the audience: In a piece of lush orchard, a small piece of land is left empty. The text explanation of the picture tells us: This is the orchard of Dongsan Jiao Brigade of Tangjiabo Commune. After cooperation in 1953, the party branch led the members to develop collective sideline production. The Central Revolutionary Old Base Area Comfort Group gave them 900 apple seedlings. The members dug out stones on the barren hills, replaced them with soil, and planted the fruit seedlings. At this time, the wealthy middle peasant represented by Mou Mingjin did not believe that the cooperative could do well, did not believe that collective sideline production could develop, and refused to allow the fruit trees to be planted in his land that had already joined the commune, on the pretext that "we can't afford to lose the seedlings if the commune collapses." In stark contrast to it are the poor and lower-middle peasant members represented by communist party member Mou Mingyuan. With gratitude to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, they were determined to keep the apple seedlings alive. Mou Mingyuan carried his luggage and brought dry food to Yantai to learn fruit tree cultivation techniques. After ten years of hard work here, the barren hills of the past have now turned into a fruit mountain. The party branch specially left the piece of land that Mou Mingjin joined the commune empty, without planting anything, as a living teaching material, so as to educate the younger generation not to forget class struggle.
    The path of Jiajiazhuang Brigade of Wannianqing Commune in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, in developing sideline production is also full of struggle. How to manage sideline production? At the beginning, some people advocated opening restaurants, some advocated public-private joint ventures, some advocated that individuals should do more and collectives should do less. After repeated discussions, the party branch and the management committee realized that it is not possible to consolidate and strengthen the collective economy by engaging in any kind of diversified management casually. There is a struggle between two lines in the policy of diversified management. In order to consolidate and develop the collective economy, the branch proposed "four no's," including no commerce and no individual farming. At the same time, it is also necessary to give play to the auxiliary role of the personal family sideline business of the members. When this opinion was brought to the members' congress for discussion, the poor and lower-middle peasants praised it wholeheartedly. They said: The collective economy should be collectively managed, and we must adhere to the socialist management line. On the basis of the continuous improvement of the ideological awareness of cadres and members, this brigade finally gradually developed 23 collective sideline production projects from small to large and from few to many. The total output value in 1964 reached more than 169,000 yuan, accounting for 46% of the total income of agriculture and sideline production. This has strongly promoted the all-round development of agricultural production.
    Shuangyi Brigade of Shuangjian Commune in Anji County, Zhejiang Province, which is known as the "Red Flag of Bamboo Sea," has relied on the mountains to feed the mountains, feed the mountains to raise the mountains, raise first and eat later, so that the Mao bamboo is cut more and more, and the contribution to the country is getting bigger and bigger. But the process of achieving these achievements was not smooth sailing either. At the beginning, a few wealthy middle peasants, in order to make immediate income, looked at the market and advocated cutting and felling more. The poor and lower-middle peasant members disagreed, believing that this practice was "eating the rice of ancestors and digging the roots of descendants." Everyone said: Our people's country will last forever, and we cannot only look at the present. Everyone united around the party branch and formulated a reasonable felling system, which guaranteed the continuous development of Mao bamboo production.
    Where class struggle is taken as the key link, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants is high, the revolutionary spirit of hard work and self-reliance is greatly promoted, and collective sideline production is done well. In the struggle to develop collective sideline production to save themselves and overcome natural disasters, Gong Dianfu, a poor peasant member of Guanzhuang Commune in Qing County, Hebei Province, disassembled an old sieve, wove it, disassembled it, and repeated it twelve times. After mastering this weaving sideline technology, he patiently taught it to 55 members. In the struggle to develop mountainous areas in Cenxi County, Guangxi, 64-year-old poor peasant Li Shiquan led seven class brothers up the mountain with five hoes and seven shovels, planting 34,000 cassia and oil tea trees in five years. At the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, in the upper reaches of the Gongnais River, 69-year-old poor peasant old woman Kuerlan led her family up the mountain to dig fritillaria, and finally "dug" out three tractors for the commune. Many societies and teams have emerged with vivid and moving deeds such as "starting a family with one sow" and "creating a thousand years of glory with one log." The Rural Sideline Products Hall tells the audience with convincing materials: On the sideline production front, it is also true that "there is no revolution without the poor peasants."
    The Rural Sideline Products Hall is a large garden with a hundred flowers blooming and unique brilliance, and the advanced typical examples exhibited have their own characteristics. However, from a national perspective, sideline production is still a weak link in the national economy, lagging behind industrial and agricultural production, lagging behind the demands of the masses, and the resource potential is very large, and only a drop in the bucket has been utilized. Many of the exhibited materials prove that whether rural sideline production can be carried out and carried out well depends on the leaders at all levels. The problem currently facing leaders at all levels in rural areas is: Standing in front of the movement, actively leading rural sideline production according to the demands of the vast poor and lower-middle peasants; or being content with the status quo, not actively leading, and lagging behind the masses? This exhibition of thirty-five advanced typical examples in the Rural Sideline Products Hall is a victorious review of the march towards the depth and breadth of production, and it is also a new starting point. Matter can be transformed into spirit, and spirit can also be transformed into matter. This exhibition will surely have a huge promoting effect on the rural sideline production movement in our country.

Since the communization, they have taken grain as the key link, with mulberry silkworms and woody grain and oil as the focus, and developed sideline production, which has promoted the annual growth of grain. The picture shows the members harvesting the abundant tung seeds. Xinhua News Agency

    Shuangyi Brigade of Shuangjian Commune in Anji County, Zhejiang Province, which is located in a mountainous area, has made every effort to develop Mao bamboo production while vigorously developing grain production, providing an average of 230,000 Mao bambooes to the country every year. The picture shows the members managing the bamboo forest. Xinhua News Agency

    Lezhi County, Sichuan Province, belongs to a hilly area. The broad masses of people have started planting mulberry and raising silkworms, and now it has become an emerging sericulture production area in Sichuan Province.

    向生产的深度和广度进军
    ——介绍全国农业展览馆农村副业馆
    编者按：农业展览馆展出的三十五个发展农村副业典型单位，用丰富的材料证明：不论是山区、平原、丘陵、滨湖、沿海等各种地区，副业生产的潜力都是很大的，副业生产都是大有可为的。这些单位的经验，将会帮助人们大开眼界，将会帮助那些原来认为自己所在地区不能发展副业的人们，把思想来一个大的解放。
    当前，农业和副业生产都是一派大好形势。但是，从全国来看，副业生产仍然是一个比较薄弱的环节。由于农业的不断发展，开展副业生产就有了更加有利的条件。只要突出政治，解放思想，充分运用各种有利条件，完全有可能把副业生产搞得更快一些，更好一些。副业搞上去了，又将反过来促进农业更大发展。农业副业互相促进，整个农村经济就会更加蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。在抓紧发展农业生产的同时，抓紧发展副业生产，是各地需要十分重视的一个问题。
    全国农业展览馆的广场上，车水马龙，人群川流不息。前几天刚刚看过全国大寨式农业典型展览的观众，兴奋的心情还未平静下来，今天又高高兴兴地来到了农村副业馆。
    山水草木皆财富
    走进全国农业展览馆农村副业馆中厅，迎面就是红底金字的巨幅语录屏，上面摘录了毛泽东同志为《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书中的《多余劳动力找到了出路》一文所写的按语：“社会主义不仅从旧社会解放了劳动者和生产资料，也解放了旧社会所无法利用的广大的自然界。人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军，替自己创造日益增多的福利事业。”这里的每一句话，每一个字，都闪烁着睿智的光辉，给人以巨大的力量。展览馆展出的来自全国的三十五个发展农村副业的先进单位的事迹和五光十色琳琅满目的副业产品，生动地体现了毛主席上述指示的英明、正确和伟大。这些年来，我国农村的广大干部和社员，正是遵循着毛主席的教导，使我国农村副业生产得到蓬勃发展的。
    在展览馆东厅，引人注目地耸立着一幅“全国主要副业产品主要产区示意图”。它概括地展示出我国幅员广大，物产丰富，农村副业生产有着广阔发展前途。从天山之麓到东海之滨，从白山黑水间到热带宝岛海南，一山一水一草一木，都蕴藏着取之不尽，用之不竭的副业资源。
    陈列在大厅的五个综合展品台，分别摆着中药材、野生动物、干鲜果品、土产工业原料、农村的废旧物资和日用杂品。它们把我国丰富多采的副业物产，进一步形象地呈现在观众眼前。就说中药材吧，贵重的如人参、鹿茸，常见的如甘草、陈皮，怪异的如全蝎、蜈蚣，形形色色，五花八门，不下两千多种。我国农民每年光是种植和采挖药材，收入就达几亿元。我国的野生动物资源也很丰富，大的如老虎、巨蟒和天鹅，小的如紫貂、麝鼠和禾花雀，几乎都是浑身是宝。这样的飞禽走兽，全国就有一千八百多种。
    从展品台上，人们可以管中窥豹地认识我国农村副业的巨大潜力。苍耳子是我国长江以北地区漫山遍野皆有的野生植物。在许多人眼里，它是比“鸡毛蒜皮”还不如的。但展出的材料却证明，它是含油量很高的野生油料，也是制造油漆、肥皂的好原料。值得注意的是，目前苍耳子的采收量，仅占可采收量的百分之几。如果能把采收量提高，不仅可以给国家增产油脂、优质饼肥，而且，还可使产地社员增加收入。再看看松香吧。松香是由松树的油脂炼制的，全国许多地方都能出产。而它却是很重要的工业原料。造一吨纸，需要十到十五公斤松香；制一万件火柴，需要一千二百公斤松香；生产油漆、肥皂和杀虫剂等，也离不开松香。这就说明开展采集松脂的副业，是十分重要而且大有可为的。
    我国社会主义工业建设的蓬勃发展，科学研究水平的不断提高，也为我国农村副业生产开拓了新的领域。展出的材料说明，农村副业和城市工业挂钩，就有了新的生命力。皂角是一种豆科乔木，生长在向阳的村边，我国几乎各地都有。农村人民历来用它来洗衣服。近年来，随着一种新型的纺织工业的诞生，皂角也突然身价百倍。人们用皂角仁提制皂夹胶，可以代替一种进口的胶，用于纺织印染工业。如果今后能增加收购，产地农民就可以增加收入，为国家节约大量外汇。这只不过是许多事例中的一个罢了。
    近几年来，各地人民公社在毛泽东思想指导下，认真贯彻执行“以农为主，以副养农，综合经营”的方针，在发展农业生产的同时，因地制宜地充分利用丰富的资源，积极发展副业生产。现在，我国农村副业生产已经有种植、饲养、纺织、采集、捕捞、狩猎、加工、作坊、烧窑、运输和积攒等十一大类，品种多至好几千个。在展览馆里，人们可以看到好些类似下面这样的图表：
    ——一幅图表，说明我国农村副业的产值，已经增加到约占农副业总产值的三分之一；
    ——一幅图表，显示我国农村副业产品的社会收购额，约占农副业产品社会收购总额的百分之四十；
    这一切都给人一个印象：我国农村副业生产在国民经济中已经占据重要的地位。发展农村副业生产，能够综合利用农村的人力和物力，为社会增加财富，为农业增加资金和积累，为社员增加收入，为工业提供原料，还可为出口服务。大力开展农村副业生产，是一个关系到进一步发展农业生产、巩固集体经济、改善人民生活和加速社会主义建设的重大问题。
    农业和副业相互促进
    在发展农村副业生产中，农业和副业的关系是一个主要问题。农村副业馆展出的各典型单位的材料，雄辩地证明只要按照毛主席指示办事，处理得好，农业和副业是可以相互促进的。从这里观众可以看到，凡是副业开展得好的单位，都是按照毛主席的教导，善于依靠群众的智慧和力量，通过实践，解决矛盾，既发展了农业，又发展了副业的单位。
    上海郊区嘉定县发展副业生产的过程，突出地体现农业和副业互为条件、互相促进的辩证关系。嘉定县的粮食生产发展到一定程度以后，由于缺乏肥料和资金，生产停滞不前。一九五八年，县委提出开展副业生产时，许多人认为嘉定“一无山，二无水”，副业门路不多，油水不大；也有的人说：“双手难捉两条鱼”。他们把农业和副业对立起来，只看到矛盾的一面，未看到统一的一面。县委分析了嘉定地处城市郊区的特点，提出副业生产以养猪为首，发展饲养业，以骨干副业带动一般副业，集体副业带动个体副业等方针，调动了社员群众发展副业生产的积极性。
    为了提供足够的猪饲料，嘉定人民除了种好饲料田外，尽量利用小河和池塘种植水生饲料，这样就把全县三万亩水面都充分利用起来。他们把稻、麦、豆、油菜的梗壳就地加工成饲料，这样就把农副产品加工和作坊等副业带动起来。他们到城市工厂装运糟渣、残羹、泔水作饲料，短途运输也发展起来了。他们还利用猪的棚舍养羊养兔，利用猪粪种蘑菇，这样就把其他副业也推动起来了。现在嘉定县共有副业十大类、一百二十多个项目。一九六三年，全县副业总产值占农副业总产值的百分之三十一点三，较一九五七年增长百分之一百六十三。一九六四年，副业总产值又比一九六三年增长百分之四十八，占农副业总收入的比重也上升到百分之三十五。这些变化，具体地反映人民公社集体生产向着深度和广度进军的巨大步伐。
    随着副业生产的发展，发展农业的条件更好了。猪多了，用于农业的肥料也就相应增多。副业的发展，不断为人民公社集体经济增加积累，促进了农业的“四化”，促进了农业增产。一九六五年，嘉定县平均亩产粮食一千一百九十斤，比一九五七年增长大约九成；平均亩产棉花一百二十斤，比一九五七年增长近两倍。
    农业增产又为副业的进一步发展提供了条件。粮食多了，饲料更加充足了。公共积累多了，“四化”程度就不断提高。现在全县机耕面积达到总耕地面积的百分之八十二。稻麦脱粒全部实现机电化。这样就可以组织更多的劳动力投入副业生产。
    当然，在发展副业生产中，一定要坚持“以农为主，以副养农，综合经营”的方针，否则不但挤掉了农业，副业本身也得不到发展。河北省兴隆县的事迹，在这方面给人以很大的启发。
    兴隆地处古长城外燕山余脉中，是个“九山半水半分田”的山区。这里在日伪“三光”政策的摧残下，全县百分之六十的面积夷为无人区，农业、副业的经济基础遭到严重的破坏。解放后，中共兴隆县委在领导群众发展生产的初期，首先碰到的就是农业和副业的矛盾。当时，县委认为兴隆山高坡陡，川窄地薄，发展生产的重点应该放在九山的“九”字上，忽视了“多种经营”必须“以粮为纲”这个根本原则。这样一来，副业生产走上了畸形发展的道路。种栗子和种核桃本来是好事，但是栽在耕地旁边，树长大遮了地，就影响了粮食增产。“小夏收”、“小秋收”本来也是好事，但是安排不好就同农业“抗膀子”，闹个“两耽误”。这种情况引起了县委的注意，重新认识和处理农副业的关系。他们说：发展山区生产，粮食是纲，林业也很重要；林业发展了，粮食能高产，多种经营才有根本。从一九五八年以来，全县提倡果树上山，坚决不与粮食争地。在农业与副业生产的劳力安排上实行“八二开”。在时间安排上，粮字当头，农忙小搞，农闲大搞，做到“两不丢”和“双丰收”。现在，这个县的多种经营项目已经发展到十四大类、五百多个品种。一九六五年，多种经营的收入占农副业总产值的百分之六十，比解放初期增长了九倍。从一九五八年以来，全县的多种经营生产为农业提供资金达三千七百多万元，大大增强了农业扩大再生产的能力。一九六五年全县平均粮食亩产量提前实现“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标。
    有了革命精神，有了辩证唯物主义的观点，祖国到处可以发展副业生产。
    在阶级斗争中发展
    在农村副业馆展出的这些先进典型中，尽管自然条件不同，人力物力的因素不同，经营项目不同，但是他们的经验中有一条是共同的，这就是以阶级斗争为纲，建立以贫农下中农为骨干的副业队伍，坚持副业生产的社会主义方向。
    以艰苦奋斗全面发展山区副业出名的山东省栖霞县，展出的材料中，有一张特别吸引观众的图片：在一片枝繁叶茂的果林当中，孤零零地空着一小块地。图片的文字说明告诉我们：这是唐家泊公社东三叫大队的果园。一九五三年合作化后，党支部领导社员开展集体副业。中央革命老根据地慰问团送给他们九百棵苹果树苗。社员们就在荒山上挖掉石头，换上泥土，栽下果苗。这时，以牟明锦为代表的富裕中农，不相信合作社能办好，不相信集体副业能发展，借口“社垮了咱赔不起苗”，不让果树栽到他已经入社的地里。同它鲜明对比的，是以共产党员牟明远为代表的贫农下中农社员。他们怀着对党中央、毛主席的感激心情，坚决要把苹果苗栽活。牟明远自己扛着行李，带着干粮，走到烟台学习果树栽培技术。在这里人们经过十年的辛勤劳动，昔日的荒山如今变成了花果山。党支部特地把牟明锦入社的那块地空着，啥也不种，作为活的教材，借以教育年青的一代，不要忘记阶级斗争。
    山西省汾阳县万年青公社贾家庄大队发展副业的道路，也充满了斗争。副业如何经营？一开始，有人主张开饭铺，有人主张公私合营，有人主张个人多搞，集体少办。党支部和管委会，经过三番五次的讨论，认识到：并不是随便搞什么样的多种经营，都能起到巩固和壮大集体经济的作用。在多种经营的方针上，存在着两条道路的斗争。为了巩固和发展集体经济，支部提出不搞商业、不搞个人单干等“四不搞”。同时，也要发挥社员个人家庭副业的辅助作用。把这个意见拿到社员大会上一讨论，贫农下中农满口称赞。他们说：集体经济，就应当集体经营，一定要坚持社会主义的经营路线。在干部和社员思想觉悟不断提高的基础上，这个大队终于由小到大，由少到多，逐步发展起二十三项集体副业生产。一九六四年的总产值达十六万九千多元，占农副业总收入的百分之四十六。有力地促进了农业生产的全面发展。
    被誉为“竹海红旗”的浙江省安吉县双建公社双一大队，这几年来靠山吃山，吃山养山，先养后吃，毛竹越砍越多，对国家贡献越来越大。但是他们在取得这些成就的过程中也不是风平浪静的。开始时，少数富裕中农为了眼前收入，两眼望着市场，主张多砍多伐。贫农下中农社员不同意，认为这种做法是“上吃祖宗饭，下挖子孙根”。大家说：我们人民江山万代，不能只看眼前。大家团结在党支部周围，制定合理砍伐制度，这才保证了毛竹生产的不断发展。
    那里以阶级斗争为纲，那里的贫农下中农革命积极性就高涨，那里的艰苦奋斗自力更生的革命精神就大大发扬，那里的集体副业生产就搞得好。河北省青县官庄公社在开展集体副业生产自救，战胜灾荒的斗争中，贫农社员公殿福，把一个旧筛子拆了编，编了拆，反复了十二次，掌握了这项编织副业技术以后，就耐心教给五十五名社员。广西岑溪县在开发山区的斗争中，六十四岁的老贫农黎石泉，带领七个阶级兄弟，扛着五把锄头和七把铁铲上山，五年间种下玉桂、油茶三万四千棵。天山脚下，巩乃斯河上游，那拉提公社的六十九岁贫农库尔兰老大娘，带动全家上山挖贝母，终于为公社“挖”出了三台拖拉机。许多社队出现了“一头母猪起家”和“一根木料创千秋”的生动感人的事迹。农村副业馆以富有说服力的材料告诉观众：在副业生产战线上，同样是“没有贫农，便没有革命”。
    农村副业馆是一个百花齐放异采纷呈的大花园，展出的先进典型各有各的特点。但是从全国看，副业生产仍然是国民经济中的薄弱环节，落后于工农业生产，落后于群众的要求，资源潜力很大，已经利用的只是九牛中的一毛。许多展出的材料证明，农村副业能否开展和开展得好坏，关键在于各级领导。当前农村各级领导面临的问题是：站在运动的前面，根据广大贫农下中农的要求，积极领导农村副业生产；还是安于现状，不去积极领导，落后于群众呢？这次农村副业馆三十五个先进典型的展出，是向生产的深度和广度进军的一次胜利的检阅，同时也是一个新的起跑点。物质可以变精神，精神也可以变为物质。这次展出，对我国农村副业生产运动，肯定会有巨大的促进作用。
