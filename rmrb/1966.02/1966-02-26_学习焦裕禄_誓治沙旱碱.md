　　Learning from Jiao Yulu, Vow to Conquer Sand, Drought, and Salinity
　　The gap in production work is a manifestation of the gap in ideological style. The root of the gap in ideological style lies in our failure to implement the study of Chairman Mao's works in transforming our thinking and improving our work. Now, we are taking Chairman Mao's works and "kantuman" (hoes) to the most difficult communes and brigades to work with the masses to subdue the "three evils" and change the face of Yutian County.
    I read Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds again and again with tears in my eyes, receiving a profound and unforgettable education. I studied it repeatedly five or six times, and each time I gained new insights.
    I used Comrade Jiao Yulu as a shining mirror to compare with my own thinking and the work in my area, and I found many gaps. I have been the county party secretary for sixteen years, and have been in Yutian for eight years, but the rural appearance of Yutian has not changed significantly. The gap in production work is a manifestation of the gap in ideological style. Regarding changing the face of Yutian, we are only satisfied with a little increase in production each year, and we lack long-term plans for controlling the wind, sand, salinity, and drought in Yutian County. In order to thoroughly grasp the details of the disasters, Comrade Jiao Yulu conducted arduous and meticulous investigations and research work for many years, checking wind gaps, chasing floods, exploring quicksand, mastering a large amount of rich firsthand information, and coming up with solutions to mobilize the masses to subdue the "three evils." But I have not done enough in this regard; I have done more cursory inspections and less personal investigation. The Kunlun Canal's eastern branch canal and the Ke'azi branch canal were inaccurate in on-site survey and design, with the former often being washed away by floods and the latter having to be rerouted after completion, resulting in waste of manpower and resources. We have not conducted in-depth investigations into the twenty-odd backward teams in the county, searched for reasons, or come up with solutions to change them. The existence of these problems is ultimately due to the fact that our thinking has not been revolutionized. The root of the failure to revolutionize our thinking lies in our poor study of Chairman Mao's works, our failure to make great efforts in the "application" aspect, our failure to implement the study in transforming our thinking and improving our work, and even more so, our failure to arm cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought at all times and in all matters like Comrade Jiao Yulu. This is the most fundamental thing we should learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu.
    Yutian County, where the Uyghur people live, is located on the southern edge of the Taklamakan Desert. There are more than 200 wind and sand events of level three or higher every year, most of which are concentrated during the growing season of crops. The annual rainfall is only more than 30 millimeters, while the evaporation reaches more than 2,400 millimeters. Saline-alkali land accounts for more than 20 percent of the cultivated land area. Working in such an area, we communists should not slow down our pace, but should try to speed it up as much as possible. We must learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's tough-bone spirit, unite and rely on the Uyghur people, go all out, and change the backward face of Yutian County as soon as possible. Spring plowing and spring sowing are about to begin. The members of the county party committee decided to take Chairman Mao's works and "kantuman" (similar to hoes) to the countryside, to the masses, to participate in production and lead production. Like Comrade Jiao Yulu, "investigating and visiting the masses during the day, reading Chairman Mao's works when returning, 'reviewing the film' at night, and taking notes in the morning," doing everything according to what Chairman Mao said. I myself will stay for a long time in the Ali Brigade of the Xin Sheng Commune, where grain is still not self-sufficient. Nearly a hundred cadres have been drawn from the county and live for a long time in areas with poor natural conditions and communes and brigades with more difficulties, exploring the laws of nature and production together with the masses, and finding ways to subdue the "three evils." The county also organized a 200-plus member ice-breaking team, led by Deputy County Chief Yiming Tu'er, to go deep into the Kunlun Mountains to break ice and divert water to irrigate the white land ahead of schedule. In the past, we mainly used surface water, but this year we will dig more groundwater. Most of the rice paddies in our county are more than ten kilometers away from the villages. In the past, people only went there during spring planting, summer management, and autumn harvest, resulting in rough cultivation and low yields. Now, more than 400 commune members have voluntarily moved to these areas, determined to change the low-yield situation. In short, we have full confidence from top to bottom, working hard for several years, tunneling through the Gobi Desert, building channels, planting trees, and completely controlling wind, sand, drought, and salinity, striving to build Yutian County, located on the border of the motherland, into a more beautiful new socialist countryside as soon as possible.

　　学习焦裕禄　誓治沙旱碱
　　生产工作上的差距是思想作风上差距的表现。思想作风上差距的根子，在于我们没有把学习毛主席著作落实在改造思想、改进工作上。现在，我们带上毛主席著作，带上“坎土曼”，到困难最大的社队去，同群众一起，制伏“三害”，改变于田县面貌
    我含着眼泪一遍又一遍地阅读了焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹，受到一次深刻难忘的教育。我反复学了五六次，每一次都有新的收获。
    我用焦裕禄同志这面光辉的镜子，对照自己的思想，对照本地区的工作，找到很多的差距。我当县委书记十六年了，到于田也有八个年头，但于田农村面貌还没有大的改变。生产工作上的差距是思想作风上差距的表现。对于改变于田面貌，我们只满足每年有一点增产，对治服于田县的风沙、盐碱、干旱缺乏长远规划。焦裕禄同志为了详尽地掌握灾害的底细，长年累月进行艰苦细致的调查研究工作，查风口，追洪水，探流沙，掌握了大量的丰富的第一手资料，拿出了办法，发动群众治服“三害”。而我在这方面做的很不够，走马观花多，亲自调查少。昆仑渠首东分干渠和克阿孜干渠就因为现场勘察设计不准确，前者经常被洪水冲垮，后者修好后又得改线，造成了人力、物力上的浪费。全县有二十几个后进队，我们也没有深入调查，寻找原因，想出办法改变它。这些问题的存在，归根结底是我们的思想没有革命化。思想没有革命化的根子，又在于我们学习毛主席著作差，没有在“用”字上狠下功夫，没有把学习落实在改造思想，改进工作上，更没有象焦裕禄同志那样时时刻刻用毛泽东思想武装干部和群众。这是我们首先应该向焦裕禄同志认真学习的最根本的一条。
    维吾尔族聚居的于田县，位于塔克拉玛干大沙漠南沿。每年有三级以上的风沙约二百多次，大多集中在农作物生长期间；每年降雨量只有三十多毫米，蒸发量却达到二千四百多毫米；盐碱地占耕地面积的百分之二十以上。在这样的地区工作，对我们共产党人来说，不应该把步子放慢，而应该尽可能地快些。我们一定要学习焦裕禄同志的硬骨头精神，团结和依靠维吾尔族人民，鼓足干劲，早日改变于田县的落后面貌。春耕春播就要开始了，县委领导成员决定带上毛主席著作，带上“坎土曼”（近似锄头）到农村去，到群众中去，参加生产，领导生产。象焦裕禄同志那样，“白天到群众中调查访问，回来读毛主席著作，晚上‘过电影’，早上记笔记”，时时、事事按毛主席说的去做。我自己要到粮食还不能自给的新声公社阿力大队长期蹲点。全县现已抽出近百名干部，长期住在自然条件较差的地区和困难较多的社队，和群众一道摸索自然和生产的规律，找出制伏“三害”的办法。全县还组织了二百多人的打冰队，在副县长依明土尔同志的率领下，深入昆仑山麓，破冰引水，提前春灌白地。过去，我们主要利用地面水，今年要大挖地下水。我县的稻田多数远离村子十多公里，过去每当春种、夏管、秋收时才有人去，耕作粗放，产量很低，现在已有四百多户社员，自愿迁往这些地区居住，决心改变低产面貌。总之，我们从上到下信心百倍，苦战几年，凿通戈壁，修砌渠道，植树造林，把风沙、干旱、盐碱彻底治服，争取早日把地处祖国边疆的于田县建设成为更加美丽的社会主义新农村。
