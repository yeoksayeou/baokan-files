　　We Found the Answer
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's lofty ideals, revolutionary determination, and hard work in the struggle against nature inspire us to forge ahead.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu carried out a great deal of arduous and meticulous work for the revolution and for the people, leading the people of Lankao to conquer the "three evils" of waterlogging, wind and sand, and saline-alkali land, and changed the face of Lankao. Shahe County also has "three evils" weighing on the people's heads, namely, "spring drought, autumn flooding, and wind and sand," as the people of Shahe often say.
    The Shahe County Party Committee also led the masses to fight against the "three evils," which played a certain role in resisting disasters, but the "three evils" are still harming the people.
    So, why have the "three evils" of Shahe County not been subdued? Why has the production landscape not fundamentally changed? I found the answer in studying Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds this time.
    In addition to other reasons, the main reason is the lack of lofty ideals for completely eliminating the "three evils" and fundamentally changing the face of Shahe, especially the lack of unwavering revolutionary determination to fight against difficulties. After I arrived in Shahe in November 1963, although I also made some plans, until now, I still lack a relatively complete plan to fundamentally cure the "three evils." In our struggle against the "three evils," we cannot grasp the main contradictions, but instead, as Chairman Mao criticized, we treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. Especially when encountering difficulties, we slack off and become anticlimactic. We do not prioritize strictness in our work, but instead, we are blocked by the word "difficult." To learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, we must learn his infinite loyalty to the revolution, his strictness in his work, his courage to fight against any difficulties, and his lofty aspirations and revolutionary determination to not rest until his goals are achieved.
    In the future, I will completely put down my airs, go deep into the countryside as an ordinary laborer, go deep into reality, go deep into the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, go deep into the places where life is the hardest, conditions are the worst, difficulties are the greatest, and tasks are the most arduous, and carry out various investigations and research work in a down-to-earth manner. I will conduct systematic inspections from the mountains and hills to the plains and depressions, find the weaknesses of the "three evils" and ways to deal with them, and fundamentally change the face of Shahe.

　　我们找到了答案
    焦裕禄同志在与自然作斗争中表现出的远大理想、革命决心和艰苦奋斗精神，激励我们勇往直前
    焦裕禄同志为了革命，为了人民，进行了大量艰苦细致的工作，领导兰考人民治服内涝、风沙、盐碱“三魔”，改变了兰考面貌。沙河县也有压在人民头上的“三魔”，即沙河人常说的“春旱、秋涝、风沙打”。
    沙河县委也领导群众对“三魔”开展斗争，起到了一定的抗灾作用，但“三魔”还在危害着人民。
    那么，沙河县的“三魔”为什么未能降伏？生产面貌为什么没有根本改变呢？这次我在学习焦裕禄同志的事迹中找到了答案。
    除了其他原因以外，主要是没有彻底除掉“三魔”、根本改变沙河面貌的远大理想，尤其是缺乏向困难作斗争的坚定不移的革命决心。一九六三年十一月我到沙河后，虽然也搞了些计划，但到现在，仍然缺乏一个根治“三魔”的比较完整的计划。我们在同“三魔”斗争中，抓不到主要矛盾，而是象毛主席批评的那样头痛治头，脚痛治脚。特别是在遇到困难时，就松懈下来，虎头蛇尾。对工作不是严字当头，而是“难”字挡道。学习焦裕禄同志就要学习他那种对革命无限忠诚，对工作严字当头，敢于同任何困难作斗争，不达目的，死不瞑目的雄心壮志和革命决心。
    今后，我要彻底放下架子，以一个普通劳动者的姿态深入农村，深入实际，深入贫下中农家里，深入到生活最艰苦、条件最差、困难最大、任务最艰巨的地方，踏踏实实地进行各种调查研究工作。从山区、丘陵到平原、洼地进行系统的考察，找到“三魔”的弱点和对付办法，根本改变沙河面貌。
