    The train passed Jiayuguan and continued speeding west. Towns became fewer and fewer, villages became fewer and fewer, and people became fewer and fewer...
    Looking at the Gobi Desert outside the train window, I thought about how many people, year after year, braved the scorching sun and bitter winds to explore for oil, transform the land, dig canals, and plant orchards on this vast Gobi Desert...
    Suddenly, a strong wind rose in the Gobi Desert. In an instant, the Gobi Desert became filled with yellow smoke and dust... The train stopped. Outside was a small station with only two red brick rooms. Although the wind was strong, these two brick rooms in the Gobi Desert still attracted me to get off the train. This was an extremely ordinary small station, as tidy and clean as any other small station. The only difference was that you couldn't find a flower bed made of pebbles or a pool for passengers to wash in at this small station. Looking around, you couldn't find another building. Therefore, this small station seemed even more welcoming to the passengers. The small house was very clean. A portrait of Chairman Mao hung on the snow-white wall, as well as a photograph of Tiananmen Square. The owner of the small station—an old worker of about fifty years old—and two or three young people were nervously flipping switches and answering the phone. It is said that the grain, vegetables, and even drinking water they consume have to be transported by train. Day and night, they are in this red brick house on the Gobi Desert, doing the ordinary work of answering the phone and switching tracks. The only climax in their daily lives is the moment when the train enters the station, because then they can see the passengers coming and going...
    Taking advantage of the fact that the old worker with a Northeast accent had some free time, I went over to chat with him: "Old comrade, in which season do you have such strong winds here?"
    "We have 'one day' of strong wind here every year." He squinted and smiled, answering me: "From New Year's Eve to New Year's Eve!"
    His humorous answer aroused a burst of laughter from the passengers. This made me even more interested in this optimistic and cheerful old man. Then I asked him: "You are from the Northeast, aren't you?"
    "Yes, that's right."
    "How many years have you been transferred here?"
    "More than six years."
    "How often is your work transferred?"
    "It depends on the needs of the revolution. If we need to work here for a lifetime, we will work here for a lifetime!" He squinted and smiled again, answering me loudly. It seemed as if he was expressing his determination to the passengers on behalf of the members of this small station, and also as if he was blaming me, a young man, for having the word "transfer" in my mind. His simple answer, no, it should be said that his lofty thought, made me even more excited. I felt like I had many more things to ask him, but at this time, the whistle sounded, and the conductor urged me onto the train. The train started, and the small station on the Gobi Desert became farther and farther away, out of sight...
    Back in the carriage, my mood could not calm down for a long time. The old man's optimistic and kind face kept appearing before my eyes. Year after year, they live a hard life willingly on this remote small station, doing ordinary and monotonous work. I regretted that I didn't write down the name of that small station, nor did I ask the name of that old comrade. Otherwise, I could communicate with him and learn more from him.
    At the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, on both sides of the Yellow River, on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, on the coast of the South China Sea... there are thousands upon thousands of such unnamed people everywhere. They are meticulously depicting the mountains and rivers of the motherland according to a great blueprint. It is precisely because of thousands upon thousands of unnamed people playing their roles in various positions that the socialist train is speeding forward!

    不知姓名的人
    王树元
    车过嘉峪关，继续往西飞驰，城镇越来越少了，乡村越来越少了，人也越来越少了……
    我望着车窗外的戈壁滩，想到有多少人常年累月的顶烈日、冒寒风在这茫茫的戈壁滩上开探着石油、改造着土地、挖掘着井渠、种植着果林……。
    突然，戈壁滩上起了大风。戈壁滩一霎时变得黄烟漫漫、沙尘蒙蒙……。车停了，见外边是一座只有两间红砖房的小站。虽然风势很大，可是这戈壁滩上的两间砖房，仍然吸引我走下车来。这是个极普通的小站，它象其他小站一样，收拾得整整齐齐、干干净净。所不同的是，在这小站上找不到用碎石砌成的花坛，也找不到供旅客洗漱的水池。举目四望，再也找不到另一所房子了。因此，这个小站，在旅客的眼里更显得亲切。小房子里非常整洁，雪白的墙壁上挂着一幅毛主席象，还有一张天安门的照片，小站的主人——一位年约五十左右的老职工和二、三个青年正在紧张地扳着电钮、接着电话。据说，他们食用的粮食、蔬菜，甚至饮用的水都得靠火车运来。他们日日夜夜就在这戈壁滩上的红砖房里，干着接电话、扳道岔这种平凡的劳动。在他们每日的生活中仅有的高潮就是火车进站的时刻，因为那时他们可以见到南来北往的旅客们……。
    我趁那位操东北口音的老职工有些空闲的时候，走过去与他搭讪：“老同志，你们这儿在哪个季节才刮这么大的风？”
      “我们这儿一年就刮‘一天’的大风。”他眯了眯笑眼，向我答道：“从大年三十儿，刮到大年三十儿！”
    他这风趣的答话，引起了旅客们的一片笑声。这使我对这位乐观、爽朗的老人更有兴趣了，接着又问他：“您是东北人吧？”
    “嗯，对了。”
      “您调到这里几年了？”
      “六年多了。”
      “你们的工作几年调动一次？”
      “这要看革命需要了，需要在这儿干一辈子，就干一辈子！”他又眯着笑眼，大声地向我回答着。仿佛是代表这边地小站的成员向旅客们表决心，又象是在责怪我这个年青人怎么脑子里会有个“调”字？他这句朴素的答话，不，应该说是他这高大的思想，使我更加激动起来了。我仿佛还有许多事要向他请教，可是，这时，汽笛响了，列车员把我催上了车。车开了，戈壁滩上的小站远了、远了、看不见了……。
    回到车厢，心情久久不能平静，眼前总是泛起那位老人的乐观而又可亲的面孔。他们常年累月的在这边远小站上，心甘情愿的过着艰苦的生活，作着平凡而又单调的劳动。我很后悔，没有记下那个小站的站名，也没有问下那位老同志的姓名，不然，我可以和他通通信，更多的向他学习一些东西。
    在昆仑山下、黄河两岸、云贵高原、南海之滨……到处都有着千千万万这样不知姓名的人。他们正按照一幅伟大的蓝图，精心描绘着祖国的万里江山。正是千千万万不知姓名的人，在各个岗位上发挥着作用，才使得社会主义的列车飞驰前进啊！
