    In the dead of winter, arriving in the Guilin area from the ice-bound north, one immediately feels refreshed. Here, it is as warm as spring, with abundant rainfall. Commune members are working in single layers of clothing, building water conservancy projects, plowing fields, and preparing the land, as if it were the busy season of spring. Guilin is famous for its unparalleled scenery, and relying on such favorable natural conditions, the people of Guilin will surely soon enter the ranks of advanced in grain production as well.

    This year will be a turning point for agricultural production in the Guilin area to move towards rapid development—the production revolution of trial planting of double-cropping rice for many years is ready to be promoted on a large scale. This area has a long frost-free period, warm climate, long sunshine hours, abundant rainfall, and fertile soil. In terms of natural conditions, it is suitable for planting double-cropping rice. However, the eight counties in northern Guilin have always mainly planted single-cropping rice. After the cooperative movement, the northern Guilin area began to experiment with changing from single-cropping to double-cropping, with successful experiences as well as failures. Because many places did not summarize their experiences and lessons in time, the progress of "changing from single to double" was relatively slow. Recent years of experimentation have proved that the natural conditions in this area are suitable for double-cropping rice but not for single-cropping mid-season rice. Planting early rice can avoid summer drought, ensure stable yields, and is also suitable for striving for high yields. In many places where early-maturing and high-yielding varieties are used, the yield of one season of early rice exceeds that of mid-season rice. Planting early rice is more proactive, and there are conditions for planting late rice. If conditions are not sufficient, one season of other autumn grains can also be planted. Changing from single-cropping to double-cropping is a directional issue for increasing production in the eight counties of northern Guilin. Last autumn, the leadership ideology revolution movement inspired the courage and zeal of party organizations at all levels to actively carry out the production revolution. The eight counties of northern Guilin are preparing to change from single-cropping to double-cropping on a large scale this year, and it is estimated that the double-cropping area will increase by more than double compared to last year.

      What to do after "butting heads"?

    In the mass discussion of "changing from single to double," many places experienced the phenomenon of "butting heads"—the opinions of cadres and the masses were inconsistent regarding how much to change and how to change it, which caused disputes.

      After "butting heads," some comrades inevitably feel a little nervous. In fact, there are always differences in people's understanding. Through debate, differences can be narrowed or even eliminated. Therefore, "butting heads" is a good phenomenon. As long as it is handled properly, it is a sign of the healthy development of a production upsurge.

    Comrades from the Guilin Prefectural Committee mentioned that many county committee comrades used to think that as long as the ideological work of grassroots cadres was done well, the targets and measures in the production revolution would be fine, without paying attention to listening to the opinions of the masses. The emergence of the "butting heads" phenomenon shows that work has gone among the masses and the opinions of the masses are being valued.

    There are many benefits to cadres and the masses being able to "butt heads." Because promoting production democracy and implementing the mass line is not only for educating the masses, but more importantly, the leadership must be educated by the masses; the tasks, plans, and programs proposed by the leadership must be fully discussed among the masses and tested by the masses. The Quanzhou County Committee working group hoped that the Qiyi Commune could have a production team achieve dwarf early rice, but they were thwarted. None of the dozen or so production teams were willing to "dwarf it." The opinions of the masses were more in line with objective reality: although dwarf stalks are high-yielding varieties, planting all dwarf stalks, planting them at the same time, and harvesting them at the same time is not conducive to arranging labor to seize the season, and seizing the season is a key to whether double-cropping rice can achieve high yields in this area. This "butting heads" was very good, making everyone more aware of this truth: it cannot be required that every opinion put forward by the leaders is correct and perfect; however, leaders should be required to consciously accept the testing of the masses and regard the testing of the masses as an indispensable process to reduce errors and make the subjective conform to objective reality.

    The correct views of the leadership can only be correctly implemented when they are truly accepted by the broad masses. When the Qiyi Commune in Quanzhou County discussed the issue of close planting, the majority agreed with close planting, and a few believed that sparse planting was better. The Quanzhou County Committee working group and the commune party branch made a very good rule: they acted according to the opinions of the majority while respecting the opinions of the minority. Several acres of land were collectively allocated to those who advocated sparse planting, allowing each of them to plant one acre of experimental fields to conduct comparative experiments with close planting under the same conditions. This is a good form of promoting production democracy. Taking out a few acres of land for sparse planting experiments, at most, only a few hundred catties of rice will be harvested less, but what is gained is a good atmosphere of promoting democracy, respecting facts, and respecting science, and the masses' sense of responsibility for collective undertakings is cultivated. Compared to a few hundred catties of grain, this is an invaluable treasure, and it will turn into thousands upon thousands of catties of grain.

      What is an advanced target?

    Production requires targets. What kind of target is a truly advanced target? In the northern Guilin area, there has always been a struggle.

    The Quanzhou County Committee asked the Daxi River District to cultivate ten high-yield teams this year. The Daxi River District Committee studied the actual situation and believed that they could only cultivate four. The Quanzhou County Committee analyzed their situation, agreed with their opinion, and greatly praised this approach. Is the target of cultivating four high-yield teams less revolutionary and advanced than cultivating ten high-yield teams? No! Four is naturally less than ten. However, four is achievable through effort; ten is impossible even with great effort. In this way, it should be affirmed that four is a truly revolutionary and advanced target. A truly advanced target must be a realistic target that combines revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude.

    The Quanzhou County Committee also discovered that the production targets of individual communes were set too low. However, they did not ask the lower levels to immediately raise the targets, but instead helped the communes mobilize the masses to discuss and put more effort into measures. The responsible comrades of the Quanzhou County Committee believed that it is also good to leave some room for the target. As long as the masses are mobilized and the measures are well completed, the cadres will change their views and appropriately increase the target themselves at a certain time. Even if the target is not revised for a while, the result of everyone's efforts, exceeding the target, will increase the confidence of the masses and cadres in increasing production. When the grassroots cadres are ideologically unconvinced, forcing them to raise the target will only increase their concerns and affect the completion of the target.

    Comrades from the Guilin Prefectural Committee and the Quanzhou County Committee both mentioned that in the past, some comrades were afraid to propose advanced targets when their revolutionary spirit was not high. In the process of revolutionizing leadership ideology, a few comrades had another one-sided view: the higher the target, the more revolutionary. They thought that only a high target could mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. In fact, a conservative target cannot mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, and how can an unrealistic high target mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses! Because when the masses feel that a certain target is impossible to achieve, they will not actively regard it as a real goal to strive for.

    Since the beginning of winter, the Guilin area has been vigorously grasping water conservancy, vigorously engaging in manure accumulation, and other winter production, and there is a shortage of labor; and during this period, there has been continuous rain, which has affected water conservancy construction. After discovering this situation, the Guilin Prefectural Committee took the initiative to reduce the water conservancy project plan. At that time, some comrades believed that since it is revolutionization, the task should not be reduced. Is adjusting targets according to the actual situation not considered revolutionization? Not at all! This is the real revolutionary spirit. Appropriately reducing the task can rationally arrange water conservancy projects, ensure the completion of those projects that must be completed, and avoid the situation of overly long front lines, dispersed forces, and failure to ensure a certain benefit area; appropriately reducing water conservancy tasks is also very beneficial to manure accumulation and other winter production. Facts have proved that this is a correct measure to promote the production revolution.

    The experience of the Guilin area shows that in the production revolution, it is very important to give full play to democracy and resolutely follow the mass line. In the future, in the process of changing from single-cropping rice to double-cropping rice, from small-scale reform to large-scale reform, they will inevitably encounter some new problems. However, as long as they firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and proceed from reality in everything, all problems are not difficult to solve.

    鼓起革命干劲以后，要注意什么？桂林地区的经验是：
    充分发扬民主　坚持群众路线
    隆冬季节，从冰封大地的北方来到桂林地区，顿觉耳目一新。这里温暖如春，雨水充沛，社员们穿着单衣劳动，修水利、犁田、整地，好象春忙时候的景象。桂林以山水甲天下闻名，桂林人民凭借这样优厚的自然条件，在粮食生产上也必将很快地进入先进行列。
    今年，将是桂林地区农业生产走向迅速发展的一个转折点——多年来试种双季稻的生产革命，准备在大面积上推行。这里无霜期长、气候温暖、日照时间长、雨量充足、土质肥沃，就自然条件说，可以种植双季稻。但是，过去桂北八县一向以种植单季稻为主。合作化运动以后，桂北地区就开始进行改单季种植为双季种植的试验，有成功的经验，也有过失败的教训。由于很多地方没有及时总结经验教训，“单改双”的进展比较缓慢。最近几年的试验证明：这个地区的自然条件适宜种双季稻而不适宜种单季中稻。种早稻，可以避过夏季干旱，可保稳产，也宜争高产。许多采用早熟高产良种的地方，一季早稻产量就超过中稻。种早稻，比较主动，有条件，可种晚稻；条件不够，还可种一季其他秋粮。变单季种植为双季种植，这是桂北八县增产的一个方向性的问题。去年秋季，领导思想革命化运动，鼓起了各级党组织积极进行生产革命的勇气和干劲。桂北八县今年准备大规模地变单季种植为双季种植，估计双季种植面积将比去年增加一倍以上。
      “顶牛”以后怎么办？
    在“单改双”的群众性大讨论中，不少地方出现“顶牛”现象——在改多少和怎么改方面，干部和群众的意见不一致，引起了争论。
      “顶牛”以后，有些同志不免有点紧张。其实，人的认识总是有差距的。经过争论，差距可以缩小，以至消除。因此，“顶牛”是一种好现象。只要处理得当，这是生产高潮健康发展的一种征兆。
    桂林地委的同志谈到，很多县委的同志过去总以为生产革命中的指标和措施，只要基层干部思想通了就行，而不注意听取群众的意见。“顶牛”现象的出现，说明工作做到群众中间去了，群众的意见受到重视了。
    干部和群众之间能够“顶”起“牛”来，好处多得很。因为发扬生产民主，实行群众路线，不只是为了教育群众，更重要的是领导要受群众的教育；领导提出的任务、计划和方案，要拿到群众中充分讨论，受群众的检验。全州县委工作组很希望七一公社能有一个生产队实现早稻矮化，不料碰了钉子，十几个生产队，谁也不肯“化”。群众的意见更加符合客观实际：矮秆虽然是高产良种，但是，全部种矮秆，同一个时间种，同一个时间收，不利于安排劳力抢季节，而抢季节是这一带种双季稻能否高产的一个关键。这个“牛”“顶”得很好，使大家更加明白了这个道理：不能要求领导者提出的每一个意见都是正确的完善的；但是，应当要求领导者自觉地接受群众的检验，把群众的检验做为减少错误、使主观符合客观实际的一个必不可少的过程。
    领导的正确主张，只有真正为广大群众所接受，才能正确地贯彻下去。全州七一公社讨论密植问题，多数人同意密植，少数人认为还是稀植好。全州县委工作组和公社党支部做了一个很好的规定，既按多数人的意见办事，又尊重少数人的意见。集体拨出几亩地，让主张稀植的人每人种一亩试验田，在同样条件下跟密植进行对比试验。这是一种发扬生产民主的好形式。拿出几亩地作稀植试验，充其量不过是少收几百斤稻谷，换得的却是发扬民主、尊重事实、尊重科学的好风气，培养了群众对集体事业的责任感。比起几百斤粮食来，这是无价之宝，它将会变成成千上万斤粮食。
      什么是先进的指标？
    生产需要有指标。什么样的指标才是真正先进的指标？在桂北地区，一直是有斗争的。
    全州县委要求大西江区今年培养十个高产队。大西江区委研究了实际情况，认为只能培养四个。全州县委分析了他们的情况，同意了他们的意见，而且很赞扬这种作法。培养四个高产队的指标比起培养十个高产队，是不是就不革命不先进呢？不是的！四个比十个，自然是少了。但是，四个是经过努力可以办得到的；十个是使劲也办不到的。这样，就应该肯定，四个是真正革命的先进的指标。真正先进的指标，必须是革命精神和科学态度相结合的实事求是的指标。
    全州县委也发现过个别公社的生产指标定得偏低了。但是，他们并没有要求下边立即提高指标，而是帮助公社发动群众讨论，在措施上下更大的功夫。全州县委的负责同志认为指标留点余地也有好处。只要群众发动起来了，措施完成得好，干部会改变自己的看法，在一定的时候自己会适当地提高指标。即使一时不修改指标，大家努力的结果，超过了指标，会使群众和干部增添更大的增产信心。当基层干部思想不通的时候，如果勉强提高指标，反而会使他们增加顾虑，影响指标的完成。
    桂林地委和全州县委的同志都谈到，过去，有些同志在革命精神不振的时候，怕提先进的指标。在领导思想革命化的过程中，少数同志又有了另一种片面的看法：指标越高越革命。他们以为指标高了，才能调动群众的积极性。其实，保守的指标调动不起群众的积极性，脱离实际的高指标何尝能够调动群众的积极性呢！因为当群众感觉到某个指标是不可能实现的时候，群众就不会积极把它真正当成奋斗目标。
    入冬以来，桂林地区大抓水利，大搞积肥和其他冬季生产，劳力不足；而在这个时期里，阴雨连绵，水利施工受到了影响。桂林地委发现这种情况以后，就主动削减了水利工程计划。当时，有些同志认为，既然革命化，就不应当减少任务。根据实际情况调整指标，是不是就不算革命化呢？不然！这正是真正的革命精神。适当地削减了任务，就可以合理安排水利工程，保证完成那些必须完成的工程，而不致因为战线过长，分散力量，不能保证一定的受益面积；适当地削减了水利任务，对积肥和其他冬季生产也大有好处。事实证明，这是促进生产革命的正确措施。
    ××× 
    桂林地区的经验，说明了在生产革命中，充分发扬民主，坚决走群众路线，是十分重要的。今后，他们在改单季稻为双季稻，从小面积改革到大面积改革的过程中，不可避免地还会遇到一些新的问题。但是，只要坚定地相信群众、依靠群众，一切从实际出发，所有的问题都是不难解决的。
