    The United States' resumption of bombing of North Vietnam has caused a strong reaction around the world. A chorus of condemnation has been issued from both inside and outside the United States. Public demonstrations have been held in various parts of the United States, and public opinion in various countries has unanimously condemned the adventurous actions of the United States in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. The Johnson government has placed itself in a position where it is condemned by all.
    The Johnson government's so-called "peace offensive" is intended to cover up its conspiracy to further expand the war. In other words, it wants to ease the angry mood at home and abroad and prepare public opinion for its new military adventures. This is completely futile. Since it is a smokescreen, it will always dissipate. The hideous face of the aggressor will sooner or later be exposed to the light of day. How can it escape the condemnation of world opinion?
    A few days ago, responsible officials in Washington desperately promoted the success of the United States' "peace offensive," saying that the United States' sincerity for peace was "clearly understood by people," and that Vietnam and China "had been isolated in world opinion." This ostrich-like self-consolation is really ridiculous. Now, as soon as the United States resumes bombing North Vietnam, it immediately mobilizes world opinion and encounters condemnation and opposition from all directions. This shows that the "peace" conspiracy painstakingly played by the Johnson government cannot deceive people. The Johnson clique should understand that the isolated situation of U.S. imperialism cannot be escaped, and it will inevitably become more isolated as the war of aggression against Vietnam is further expanded.

### 谴责来自四面八方

    谴责来自四面八方
    美国恢复对越南北方的轰炸，在全世界引起了强烈的反响。从美国国内外发出一片谴责之声。美国各地公众纷纷举行抗议示威，各国舆论同声斥责美国扩大侵越战争的冒险行动。约翰逊政府把自己置于一个千夫所指的地位。
    约翰逊政府大搞所谓“和平攻势”，是为了掩盖它进一步扩大战争的阴谋，换句话说，是想要缓和国内外的愤怒情绪，给它进行新的军事冒险准备舆论，这完全是徒然的。既然是烟幕，总是要消散的，侵略者的狰狞面目迟早要暴露在光天化日之下，这又怎么能够逃避世界舆论的谴责呢？
    几天之前，华盛顿的负责官员拼命宣传美国的“和平攻势”取得了成功，说什么美国的和平诚意已“清楚地被人所理解”，什么越南和中国“已在世界舆论中孤立起来”。这种掩耳盗铃式的自我安慰实在可笑。现在，美国一恢复对越南北方的轰炸，就立即把世界舆论调动了起来，遭到来自四面八方的谴责和反对，这说明约翰逊政府费尽力气玩弄的“和平”阴谋，是骗不了人的。约翰逊之流应当明白，美帝国主义的孤立处境是摆脱不了的，而且随着侵越战争的进一步扩大，它必然要更加孤立。
