    How much coal is needed to produce one ton of alcohol?
   "One and a half tons of coal per ton of alcohol." This is one answer. Eight years ago, the Shanghai Alcohol Factory used 1,590 kilograms of coal to produce one ton of alcohol.
   "One ton of coal per ton of alcohol." This is another answer. At the end of 1962, the Shanghai Alcohol Factory used just over 940 kilograms of coal to produce one ton of alcohol.
    "Half a ton of coal per ton of alcohol." This is yet another answer. In 1965, the Shanghai Alcohol Factory was already using just over 590 kilograms of coal to produce one ton of alcohol. They are confidently advancing towards the goal of "half a ton of coal per ton of alcohol."
    The Shanghai Alcohol Factory's steadily decreasing coal consumption, from "one and a half tons of coal per ton of alcohol" to "one ton of coal per ton of alcohol" to approaching "half a ton of coal per ton of alcohol," serves as an excellent wake-up call to those comrades who believe that "the potential has already been exhausted."
    In the past years' campaigns to increase production and practice economy, there have always been some comrades who believe that after repeated campaigns to increase production and practice economy, the potential has been almost exhausted, and there is not much profit to be gained. Even within the Shanghai Alcohol Factory, whenever coal consumption dropped to a new level, some people would say, "The potential has been exhausted, we have reached the limit of saving." Facts have proven that these comrades are wrong.
    Is the potential for production limited or unlimited? We say that under certain conditions, the potential for production is limited; but from a developmental perspective, the potential for production is unlimited.
    Under certain conditions, the potential for production is limited. This means that everything has its own limit, and exceeding that limit will lead to the opposite. For example, every piece of equipment has its load limit, and long-term overload operation may lead to equipment accidents. It is unscientific to deny that the potential for production is limited under certain conditions.
    However, this is only one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, everything in the world is developing, and from a developmental point of view, the potential for production is unlimited. Every piece of equipment has its load limit, but through technological innovation and technological revolution, any piece of equipment can improve efficiency and withstand loads that it could not withstand in the past. It is also unscientific to deny that the potential for production is unlimited as conditions constantly change.
    How is this transformation from limited potential to unlimited potential achieved? The Shanghai workers put it well: "Add one point of enthusiasm, add one measure, add one condition, and new potential will emerge."
    Indeed, enthusiasm plus measures, that is, revolutionary spirit plus scientific attitude, will certainly bring out potential. As long as we give prominence to politics, give prominence to Mao Zedong Thought, and make the political atmosphere strong, people's consciousness will inevitably increase, and their enthusiasm will double. With this revolutionary enthusiasm, we will certainly be able to see far ahead and see the potential that we could not see in the past. Similarly, as long as we adhere to a strict scientific attitude, thoroughly grasp the laws of production, and make economic work more and more detailed, we will inevitably be able to come up with many good measures. With this scientific attitude, we will certainly be able to be down-to-earth and dig out the potential that we could not dig out in the past.
    Summon up enthusiasm, add more measures, combine revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude, constantly improve the political and ideological consciousness and technical and cultural level of employees, and constantly improve the material and technical equipment and production technology methods of enterprises, so that we can continuously tap the potential for increasing production and practicing economy. The decrease in coal consumption at the Shanghai Alcohol Factory from "one and a half tons of coal per ton of alcohol" to approaching "half a ton of coal per ton of alcohol" is the result of continuously strengthening political and ideological work and reforming production technology.
    There is no end to the development of production, and in this sense, there is no end to tapping the potential for production. The campaign to increase production and practice economy is a campaign to mobilize the broad masses of workers to tap the potential for production. As long as we adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, combine revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude, we will certainly be able to continuously tap new production potential.

### 挖不完的潜力

    挖不完的潜力
    生产一吨酒精要用多少煤？
   “一吨酒精吨半煤。”这是一种答案。八年前的上海酒精厂，就是用一千五百九十公斤煤生产一吨酒精的。
   “一吨酒精一吨煤。”这是一种答案。一九六二年底的上海酒精厂，就是用九百四十多公斤煤生产一吨酒精的。
    “一吨酒精半吨煤。”这又是一种答案。一九六五年的上海酒精厂，已经用五百九十多公斤煤生产一吨酒精。他们正在满怀信心，朝“一吨酒精半吨煤”的目标前进。
    从“一吨酒精吨半煤”，到“一吨酒精一吨煤”，到接近“一吨酒精半吨煤”，上海酒精厂耗煤量的节节下降，对那些认为“潜力早已挖完”的同志，是一服很好的清醒剂。
    在历年的增产节约运动中，都有这样一些同志，他们认为经过历次增产节约运动，潜力已经挖得差不多了，油水不大了。就在上海酒精厂，每当耗煤量降到一个新的水平，也总有人说：“潜力挖尽了，节约到顶了。”事实证明，这些同志的想法错了。
    生产的潜力，究竟是有限的，还是无限的呢？我们说：在一定的条件下，生产的潜力是有限的；用发展的观点来看，生产的潜力是无限的。
    在一定的条件下，生产的潜力是有限的，这就是说，事物总有自己的极限，超过了极限，就会走向反面。例如，每一种设备，都有它的负荷极限，长期超负荷运转，就可能酝成设备事故。不承认生产的潜力在一定条件下是有限的，这是违反科学的。
    然而，这只是事情的一个方面。另一方面，世界上的任何事物都是发展的，用发展的观点来看，生产的潜力又是无限的。每一种设备都有它的负荷极限，但是，经过技术革新和技术革命，任何一种设备都可能提高效率，承受过去不能承受的负荷。不承认生产的潜力在条件不断改变下是无限的，这也是违反科学的。
    由有限的潜力到无限的潜力，这个转化是怎样实现的呢？上海的工人说得好：“添一分干劲，加一个措施，多一个条件，新的潜力就又出来了。”
    的确，干劲加措施，也就是革命精神加科学态度，一定可以出潜力。只要突出政治，突出毛泽东思想，把政治空气搞得浓浓的，使人的觉悟越来越高，必然会干劲倍增。有了这种革命的干劲，一定能高瞻远瞩，看到过去看不到的潜力。同样，只要坚持严格的科学态度，把生产规律摸得透透的，使经济工作越做越细，必然能够想出很多很好的措施。有了这种科学态度，一定能脚踏实地，挖出过去挖不出的潜力。
    鼓足干劲，添增措施，把革命精神和科学态度结合起来，不断地提高职工的政治思想觉悟和技术文化水平，不断地改善企业的物质技术装备和生产技术方法，就能不断地挖掘增产节约的潜力。上海酒精厂的耗煤量从“一吨酒精吨半煤”下降到接近“一吨酒精半吨煤”，这就是不断地加强政治思想工作和改革生产工艺的结果。
    生产的发展是没有止境的，从这个意义上说，挖掘生产潜力也是没有止境的。增产节约运动就是一个动员广大职工挖掘生产潜力的运动。只要我们坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，把革命精神和科学态度结合起来，就一定能够不断地挖掘出新的生产潜力来。
