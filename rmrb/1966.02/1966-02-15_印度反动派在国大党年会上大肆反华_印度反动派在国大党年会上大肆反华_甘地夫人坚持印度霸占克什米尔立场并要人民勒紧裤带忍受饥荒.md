　　Xinhua News Agency, February 13th dispatch from New Delhi: The 70th annual meeting of the Indian ruling party, the Congress Party, concluded on the 12th after four days of arguing. Although the Congress Party leaders at this annual meeting wantonly opposed China, praised the new Soviet leaders and the "Tashkent Declaration," and reiterated their position of continuing to occupy Kashmir, attempting to divert attention and cover up the deterioration of the domestic situation in India, the Congress Party government's incompetence in handling the serious domestic food crisis in India has met with unprecedented strong opposition, and fierce disputes have erupted between Congress Party leaders and members.

　　According to Reuters, Indian Defense Minister Chavan openly advocated on the 10th that India should continue to target China and step up its arms expansion and war preparations. He falsely accused China of "aggression" against India, saying that India's arms expansion and war preparations in the past three years "were only to deal with China's aggression, so India must continue to maintain its defense readiness without slackening." Congress Party Chairman Kamaraj, in his speech at the closing ceremony of the annual meeting on the 12th, also clamored to be ready to deal with China's so-called "aggression" at any time.

　　The conference lavishly praised the "Tashkent Declaration" concocted by the new Soviet leaders in order to continue to shield the Indian reactionaries and promote so-called "peaceful coexistence," and passed a resolution welcoming this "declaration" on the 12th. Kamaraj and Chavan stubbornly reiterated India's position of continuing to occupy Kashmir in their speeches, while repeatedly praising the diplomatic skills of the new Soviet leaders. Kamaraj said, "The Tashkent Declaration is the result of Kosygin's diplomatic skills," "I would like to express our heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Congress Party to the Soviet Premier..."

　　Chavan said arrogantly: "India insists that Kashmir is a part of India with sovereign ownership, and this position is not negotiable." He said that India's attitude "will not change—I can say that with certainty." He also revealed that India may use the pretext of dealing with so-called Pakistani "infiltrators" to provoke armed aggression against Pakistan again. He said: "If the infiltrators repeat what they have done in the past, India will also repeat what it has done in the past."

　　Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Gandhi also delivered a speech at the annual meeting, reiterating India's position of occupying Kashmir. She said, "Our attitude on the Kashmir issue is the same as in the past, and no one can make us abandon this attitude."

　　Despite the various diversionary tactics used by the Congress Party leaders, this annual meeting still saw fierce disputes erupt over the increasingly serious domestic food problem. According to DPA, a serious uproar occurred at the meeting on the 11th, opposing the food policy pursued by the Congress Party leaders. "Despite the efforts of Congress Party Chairman Kamaraj and Prime Minister Mrs. Gandhi, Congress Party members shouted loudly at the party leaders, accusing them of mishandling the domestic food problem." Speakers "fiercely attacked the government's food and agricultural policies and the failure to fulfill its promises..." This news agency believes that "since (India) independence, Congress Party leaders have never faced such fierce opposition to its policies."

　　After a fierce argument, the annual meeting barely passed resolutions on food and economic issues on the night of the 12th.

　　After these resolutions were passed, Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Gandhi spoke again, calling on the broad masses of Indian working people who are struggling on the front lines of hunger to continue to tighten their belts. The Associated Press said that in her speech, Mrs. Gandhi called on Indian citizens to "change their eating habits to adapt to the level of agricultural production."

　　The Congress Party annual meeting is in principle held once a year to discuss and decide on the current government's domestic and foreign policies.

    印度反动派在国大党年会上大肆反华
    恰范公然叫嚷要加紧扩军备战对付中国
    甘地夫人坚持印度霸占克什米尔立场并要人民勒紧裤带忍受饥荒
    新华社十三日讯　新德里消息：印度执政党国大党第七十届年会经过四天争吵以后，十二日闭幕。尽管国大党领导人在这次年会上大肆反华，吹捧苏联新领导和“塔什干宣言”，重申继续霸占克什米尔的立场，企图以此转移视线，掩饰印度国内情况的恶化，但是，国大党政府在处理印度国内严重的粮食危机上的无能，遭到了前所未有的强烈反对，在国大党领导和成员之间爆发了激烈的争吵。
    据路透社报道，印度国防部长恰范十日在会上公开鼓吹印度继续针对中国，加紧扩军备战。他颠倒黑白地诬蔑中国对印度进行“侵略”，说什么，印度在过去三年来扩军备战，“只是为了对付中国的侵略的，所以印度必须毫不放松地继续保持它的防御戒备状态。”国大党主席卡马拉季十二日在年会闭幕式上发表讲话时，也叫嚷要随时准备对付中国的所谓“侵略”。
    大会大肆吹捧苏联新领导为了继续袒护印度反动派和宣扬所谓“和平共处”而炮制的“塔什干宣言”，并且在十二日通过了欢迎这个“宣言”的决议。卡马拉季和恰范在讲话中顽固地重申了印度继续霸占克什米尔的立场，同时一再赞扬苏联新领导的外交手腕。卡马拉季说，“塔什干宣言是柯西金的外交手腕的结果”，“我愿意代表国大党对苏联总理……表示我们衷心的感谢”。
    恰范蛮横地说：“印度坚持克什米尔是印度拥有主权的一部分的立场，是不能谈判的。”他说，印度的态度“不会改变——我可以肯定这样说”。他还透露，印度可能利用对付所谓巴基斯坦的“渗入者”的借口，再度挑起对巴基斯坦的武装侵略。他说：“如果渗入者重复他们过去所做的事情，印度也将重复它过去所做的事情”。
    印度总理甘地夫人在年会上也发表讲话，重申印度霸占克什米尔的立场。她说，“我们在克什米尔问题上的态度同过去一样，没有人能够使我们放弃这种态度”。
    尽管国大党领导人使用种种转移视线的手法，但是这次年会仍然围绕着国内日益严重的粮食问题爆发了激烈的争吵。据德新社报道，在十一日的会议上发生了一次严重的起哄，反对国大党领导奉行的粮食政策。“尽管国大党主席卡马拉季和总理甘地夫人作出了努力，国大党成员们冲着党的领导人大声喊叫，指责他们处理国内粮食问题不当。”讲话者“对政府的粮食与农业政策以及没有履行诺言……进行激烈的攻击”。这家通讯社认为，“自从（印度）独立以来，国大党领导从来没有面临过对它的政策这么激烈的反对”。
    年会经过激烈争吵以后，十二日夜勉强通过了关于粮食和经济问题的决议。
    印度总理甘地夫人在这些决议通过以后再次发言，号召正在饥饿战线上挣扎的印度广大劳动人民继续勒紧裤带。美联社说，甘地夫人在发言中呼吁印度公民“改变他们的饮食习惯以便同农业生产水平相适应”。
    国大党年会原则上一年举行一次，讨论和决定现政府的内外政策。
