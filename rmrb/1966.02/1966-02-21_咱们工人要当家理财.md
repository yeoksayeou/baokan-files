　　Our Workers Must Manage Finances
　　Wang Cexun, Worker of Anshan Iron and Steel Company
    I am a worker in the Light Calcining Workshop of the Magnesium Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. In October 1964, I was elected by everyone as a worker economic accountant. At that time, my thoughts were very contradictory. On the one hand, I felt that everyone elected me because they trusted me, and I felt very honored and responsible. On the other hand, I was afraid of offending people and causing trouble. When I got home, I said to my wife: "I was elected as an economic accountant!" She asked me what an economic accountant was, whether it was like the production team's accountant in charge of money? I replied: "It's about managing money." She immediately said: "This can't be done, something happened to our production team's accountant, you can't manage money." At that time, I felt that what she said made sense. Back at the workshop, I said to the workshop director: "I only have two and a half years of education, I'm afraid I can't do this job." At that time, I was too embarrassed to say what my wife thought. However, the workshop director saw what I meant, and he asked me: "Why don't we have an education?" The director's question reminded me of the past: Before liberation, my family was very poor, and we couldn't even get enough to eat, let alone have money to go to school! Since I was a child, I herded cattle for the landlord, living a life worse than a beast. After liberation, we workers became the masters of the country, not only our lives improved, but we also gained political status. At this time, I thought: "As workers, we should act like masters. Isn't everyone electing me as a worker accountant giving me the responsibility of being a master of the house?" Thinking of this, I increased my courage and confidence. Later, the Party group leader gave me a copy of Chairman Mao's works and asked me to study it carefully. Chairman Mao said: "What is work? Work is struggle. Those places with difficulties and problems need us to solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we must go, that is a good comrade." This made me more determined in my mind to do this work well.
    When I started working, I encountered many difficulties. I didn't understand or know how to calculate "unit cost," "unit consumption," or "total cost." Especially with the abacus, it was even more difficult, and I couldn't figure out how to use it. Because I had a clear understanding of the worker accountant ideologically, I never gave up, insisted on practicing every day, and humbly learned from cadres and worker administrators. Now I have basically learned it, and I calculate the cost every ten days myself.
    Should workers as accountants just be satisfied with doing the accounting? No. The purpose of accounting is to manage finances, to mobilize workers to save the country's property. At that time, I thought, in what areas should we save to reduce costs? I heard that buying a pair of work leather shoes cost sixteen yuan. I thought, if I received one less pair of work shoes, I could save sixteen yuan. Right, I took my own work shoes to get them soled and didn't get new ones. I used to get a pair every six months, now I only get a pair a year. Other items such as hand muffs and dust caps, I use old ones and don't get new ones. With just these, I can save more than thirty yuan a year. Because I took the lead in saving, other workers followed suit, which greatly saved the group's labor protection supplies. Later, workers also suggested that we should not get new furnace bars for the magnesite kiln, and that saving one bar would save twelve yuan and eighty cents. After everyone's experiment, we turned the bent ones over and used them again. In this way, we used seventy-six fewer furnace bars throughout the year, saving more than nine hundred yuan.
    In February last year, because the total working time for the month was short, the workshop's cost calculation was about to exceed the budget. At this time, I discussed with the group of workers whether we could avoid exceeding the budget. At that time, everyone put forward many saving measures. Worker Yang Baogui suggested that he still had eight pairs of old hand muffs that could be slightly repaired, so he could avoid getting new ones for two months. Other workers also put forward ways to use waste materials. As a result, the monthly cost not only did not exceed the budget, but was reduced by one hundred and fifty yuan. In this way, our group's annual cost was reduced by nearly twenty thousand yuan.
    In order to do a good job in economic accounting, I also paid attention to grasping living ideas and conducting education. One day, I found that a worker was not in a good mood, throwing his shovel and tools after coming to work. I had a personal talk with him and learned that he was having a fight with his wife. After work that day, I and several workers from the group went to visit his home and solved the contradictions in their family. At that time, the worker was very excited and said that he would work hard and pay attention to taking care of the tools. Usually, I also kept a "Good People, Good Deeds Book" to record the workers' daily good deeds and saving deeds as a reference for the group's monthly evaluation, which greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for managing finances.
    I have realized that to be a good worker accountant, we must emphasize politics, improve the consciousness of the working class, and inspire the workers' sense of responsibility for managing finances. At the same time, the accountant himself should set an example and pay attention to saving everywhere. I have been doing accounting work for more than a year, and I have basically achieved five satisfactions, namely: satisfaction of the leadership, the department, the group, myself, and my wife.

　　咱们工人要当家理财
　　鞍山钢铁公司工人　王策勋
    我是鞍山钢铁公司镁矿轻烧车间的工人。一九六四年十月，大家选我当了工人经济核算员。当时，我的思想很矛盾。一方面，感到大家选我，是信任我，我感到很光荣，同时，又感到责任重大；另一方面，我又怕得罪人，怕麻烦。我回到家里，就跟我爱人说：“我当选为经济核算员了！”她问我什么叫经济核算员，是否就是和生产队的会计一样管钱的？我回答说：“是管钱的。”她马上就说：“这可当不得，咱们生产队的会计都出事了，钱管不得。”当时，我听了也觉得有道理。回到车间，我就向车间主任说：“我才二年半的文化，怕这工作搞不了。”当时，我还不好意思把我爱人的想法说出来。但是，车间主任看出了我的意思，他问我：“为什么咱们没有文化？”主任这么一提，使我想起了往事：解放前，家里很穷，那时连饭都吃不饱，哪里有钱去上学啊！我从小就给地主放牛，过着牛马不如的生活。解放了，咱们工人当了国家的主人，不仅生活好了，而且有了政治地位。这时我想：“当工人，应该象做主人的样子。大家选我当工人核算员，不就是给我当家作主的责任吗？”想到这里，给自己增加了勇气和信心。后来党小组长给我一本毛主席著作，要我认真学习。毛主席说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”这使我从思想上更加坚定了做好这个工作的信心。
    开始工作的时候，我遇到很多的困难，什么“单位成本”、“单位消耗”、“总成本”都听不懂，也不会算。特别是打算盘，困难更多，怎么也不会拨弄。因为从思想上对工人核算员有了明确的认识，自己决不灰心，天天坚持练习，虚心向干部和工人管理员学习。现在我已经基本上学会了，每旬的成本都是自己算的。
    工人当核算员，是否就只满足于算算账呢？不能。核算的目的是要理财，要发动工人大家来节约国家的财产。当时我就想，应该从哪些方面节约，才能降低成本呢？我听说买双作业皮鞋要十六元。我想，如果少领一双作业鞋，就能节约十六元。对，我就把自己的作业鞋去打了个掌，不领新的，原来半年领一双，现在我一年才领一双。其他如手闷子、防尘帽，都利用旧的，不领新的。光这些，我一年就可节约三十多元。由于自己带头节约，其他工人也跟着学，这大大节约了小组的劳动保护用品。后来工人又提出苦土窑的炉条也不领新的，少领一根就可节约十二元八角，经过大家试验，把烧弯的反过来再用。就这样，全年少用了七十六根炉条，节约九百多元。
    去年二月份，因为全月作业时间少，在车间计算成本要超支。这时，我就和小组工人商量能不能不超支，当时大家就提出了许多节约的措施。工人杨宝贵提出，他还有八副过去用破的手闷子，稍加修补就可以两个月不领新的，其他工人也纷纷提出利用废旧物资的办法。结果全月成本不仅没有超支，反而降低一百五十元。就这样，我们小组全年成本就降低了近二万元。
    为了做好经济核算工作，我还注意抓活的思想，进行教育。有一天，我发现一个工人情绪不太好，上班后摔铁锹，摔工具，我就找他个别谈心，才知道他和爱人闹别扭。当天下班后，我和小组的几位工人一起到他家去访问，解决了他们家庭的矛盾。当时这位工人很激动，表示一定要好好劳动，注意爱护工具。平时，我还订了个“好人好事簿”，把工人日常的好人好事和节约事迹登记下来，作为月底小组评比的参考，大大鼓励了工人当家理财的积极性。
    我体会到当好工人核算员，一定要突出政治，提高工人阶级的自觉性，启发工人当家理财的责任感。同时，核算员本人应该以身作则，处处注意节约。我干了一年多的核算工作，基本上作到了五满意，即：领导、科室、小组、本人、爱人都满意。
