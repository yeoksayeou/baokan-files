    The Ugly Face of an Accomplice
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    The Soviet leaders' pursuit of U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world has reached an extremely impatient stage. An article entitled "The Responsibility of the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee" published in the Soviet magazine *New Times* on February 4 provides a new piece of evidence.
    The Soviet leaders once claimed that the United States could not intend to improve U.S.-Soviet relations while simultaneously launching armed attacks on Vietnam. Later, when the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee reconvened in Geneva, the Soviet government representatives changed their tune, stating that the Soviet Union "does not want to make our discussions dependent on Vietnam," meaning that they could put aside the Vietnam issue and reach an agreement on the so-called non-proliferation treaty. Now, the article in the Soviet magazine *New Times* goes a step further, arguing that the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam not only does not hinder U.S.-Soviet cooperation, but that precisely because of the "sharpening" of the situation in Vietnam, it is "more important than ever" for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to strike a deal on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation.
    What does this fact show? It can only show that the Soviet leaders' talk of "opposing U.S. aggression" and "supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people" is all false, all deceptive. Just as U.S. imperialism is further expanding its war of aggression in Vietnam and frantically slaughtering the Vietnamese people, the Soviet leaders actually believe that they can shake hands and make peace with such a No. 1 arch-gangster and murderer, and even openly use the "sharpening" of the situation in Vietnam as a reason to finalize a deal with U.S. imperialism on the issue of nuclear weapons. Can this be called opposing U.S. aggression? Can it be called supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people? No, this is an outright betrayal of the Vietnamese people, a betrayal of the people of the world!
    What exactly are the Soviet leaders up to on the Vietnam issue, and what kind of role are they playing? There is a passage in the *New Times* article that is worth noting. It reads: "In our time, relying on brute force, relying on weapons—no matter how powerful—cannot solve the problems that have matured. And the key to solving the most acute and urgent problems can be found at the negotiating table. Vietnam and Tashkent symbolize two diametrically opposed approaches in international affairs today. And everyone should be clear: which of these two approaches is in the interests of humanity."
    Who exactly are these words of the Khrushchev revisionists addressed to? Is it to persuade U.S. imperialism? Of course not. Because the Johnson administration itself is desperately peddling the "peace talks" swindle, eagerly hoping to "sit down at the negotiating table" in an attempt to obtain what it cannot obtain on the battlefield and achieve its goal of continuing to occupy South Vietnam. The Khrushchev revisionists are merely using the same words to cheer for Johnson. So, isn't it very clear who they are asking to give up violence?
    In fact, the Soviet leaders have been running errands and serving the Johnson administration's "peace talks" conspiracy. If, on the issue of "peace talks," the Soviet leaders have often been evasive and somewhat wary, then the *New Times* article has revealed the Soviet leaders' bottom line.
    The *New Times* article believes that there are "two diametrically opposed approaches," "Tashkent and Vietnam," in the world today, and that the former approach is in the interests of humanity, while the latter is not. This further exposes the ugly face of the Khrushchev revisionists. May I ask, how can it be said that the Vietnamese people taking up arms to resist the aggression of U.S. imperialism is violating the interests of humanity, while tolerating U.S. imperialist aggression and allowing American bandits to occupy and trample on Vietnamese territory is in the interests of humanity? Does this mean that in order to conform to your so-called "interests of humanity," the Vietnamese people should lay down their arms and stop fighting in the face of U.S. imperialist armed aggression? What is the difference between this logic and the gangster logic of U.S. imperialism!
    The Soviet leaders and the Soviet press are vigorously promoting the application of the so-called "Tashkent spirit" to the Vietnam issue. This is nothing more than an attempt to replace the Vietnamese people's revolutionary policy of resisting America and saving the nation with the "Tashkent approach," thereby incorporating the Vietnam issue into the orbit of U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world.
    There are indeed two fundamentally opposed lines on the Vietnam issue. One is the revolutionary line of the Vietnamese people adhering to the armed struggle of resisting America and saving the nation, and the other is the capitulationist line of the Soviet leaders betraying the revolutionary cause of the Vietnamese people. These two lines are as incompatible as fire and water. The Soviet leaders are stepping up their "joint actions" with U.S. imperialism in an attempt to extinguish the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle. They are playing a role that U.S. imperialism cannot play and acting as accomplices in U.S. imperialist aggression. No matter how the Soviet leaders disguise themselves, their shameful faces will eventually be constantly exposed. The *New Times* article is just one proof of this.

    帮凶者的嘴脸
    本报评论员
    苏联领导人追求美苏合作主宰世界，已经到了何等迫不及待的地步：苏联《新时代》杂志二月四日刊登的一篇题为《十八国裁军委员会的责任》的文章，又提供了一个新的证据。
    苏联领导人曾经声称，美国不能一方面打算改善美苏关系，同时却对越南进行武装袭击。后来，当十八国裁军委员会在日内瓦复会的时候，苏联政府代表就改变了腔调，表示苏联“不希望使我们的讨论取决于越南”，也就是说，可以撇开越南问题，就所谓防止核扩散条约达成协议。现在，苏联《新时代》杂志的文章又进了一步，认为美国侵略越南的战争，不仅不妨碍美苏合作，而且正是因为越南局势的“尖锐化”，所以美苏在防止核扩散问题上做成交易，“比任何时候都要重要”。
    这个事实说明什么呢？它只能说明，苏联领导人口头上讲的什么“反对美国侵略”呀，什么“支持越南人民斗争”呀，统统是假的，统统是骗人的。正当美帝国主义进一步扩大侵越战争、疯狂屠杀越南人民的时候，苏联领导人竟然认为他们可以同这样一个天字第一号大强盗和杀人犯握手言欢，而且还公然地以越南局势“尖锐化”为理由，要同美帝国主义在核武器问题上拍板成交。难道这能够叫做反对美国侵略吗？能够叫做支持越南人民斗争吗？不，这是不折不扣的对越南人民的大背叛，对全世界人民的大背叛！
    在越南问题上，苏联领导人究竟打的是什么主意，扮演的是一个什么样的角色？《新时代》杂志的文章中有一段话是值得注意的。它写道：“在我们的时代，依靠粗暴的力量，依靠武器——不论它多么厉害——都不能解决已经成熟的问题。而解决最尖锐和最迫切问题的关键，能在谈判桌上找到。越南和塔什干象征着国际事务中目前两个截然相反的方针。而每个人都应该清楚：这两个方针里哪一个符合人类利益。”
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的这段话，究竟是对谁讲的呢？是对美帝国主义进行劝说吗？当然不是。因为约翰逊政府自己就在拼命兜售“和谈”骗局，急切地希望“坐到谈判桌边来”，妄图取得它在战场上所取不到的东西，达到它继续霸占南越的目的。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者不过是在用同样的词句为约翰逊摇旗呐喊。那么，他们的这段话究竟是要谁放弃暴力，岂不是十分清楚吗？
    事实上，苏联领导人一直就在替约翰逊政府的“和谈”阴谋奔走效劳。如果说，在“和谈”的问题上，苏联领导人还常常闪烁其词，有所忌讳的话，那么，《新时代》杂志的文章就把苏联领导人的底牌和盘端出来了。
    《新时代》杂志的文章认为，目前世界存在着“塔什干和越南”“两个截然相反的方针”，而前一种方针是符合人类利益的，后一种方针则不符合人类利益。这就更加清楚地暴露了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的嘴脸。请问，怎么能说越南人民拿起武器反抗美帝国主义的侵略，竟是违反人类利益，而容忍美帝国主义侵略，让美国强盗霸占和蹂躏越南的国土，反而是符合人类利益的呢？难道为了符合你们的所谓“人类利益”，越南人民就应当在美帝国主义的武装侵略面前放下武器，停止战斗吗？这种逻辑，同美帝国主义的强盗逻辑有什么区别！
    苏联领导人和苏联报刊大肆鼓吹把所谓“塔什干精神”用到越南问题上来，这无非是企图用“塔什干的方针”来代替越南人民抗美救国的革命方针，从而把越南问题纳入美苏合作主宰世界的轨道。
    在越南问题上的确存在着两条根本对立的路线。一条是越南人民坚持抗美救国武装斗争的革命路线，另一条是苏联领导人背叛越南人民革命事业的投降主义路线。这两条路线是水火不相容的。苏联领导人正在加紧同美帝国主义采取“联合行动”，妄图扑灭越南人民的革命斗争。他们起着美帝国主义所不能起的作用，扮演着美帝国主义侵略帮凶的角色。不管苏联领导人怎样把自己伪装起来，他们的这种可耻面目终究是会不断地暴露出来的。《新时代》杂志的文章，不过是一个证明而已。
