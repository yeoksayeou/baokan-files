    The military and civilians of Gu Chi County, South Vietnam, achieved a great victory in the anti-"mopping-up" battles in January of this year, writing a glorious page in the history of the South Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The South Vietnamese "Liberation Army Daily" summarized the combat experience of this great victory. These rich experiences are not only the precious wealth of the Vietnamese people, but also the wealth of revolutionary people all over the world.
    People's war is the most effective magic weapon for the invaded people to deal with U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The South Vietnamese people, like all other revolutionary people, were not born knowing how to fight. They learn war from war, absorbing the experience of their predecessors on the one hand, and constantly accumulating their own experience on the other. In this way, they have transformed from being unskilled in people's war to being skilled in people's war. In their struggle against the American aggressors, the South Vietnamese people, through their own practice, have created many experiences in the application of the strategy and tactics of people's war, further enriching the treasure trove of people's war experience.
    Of course, the enemy will also gain some experience in the war, even if it is the experience of failure. They will also revise their strategies and tactics in order to avoid new failures. However, the fundamental weakness of U.S. imperialism determines that no matter how much it increases its troops and modern weapons, and no matter how it changes its strategies and tactics, it has no way to deal with people's war. On the contrary, the South Vietnamese people are bound to become more mature and tenacious in the people's war, constantly creating new strategies and tactics to defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys, making up for deficiencies in weapons and overcoming all difficulties to achieve the final victory. The more the South Vietnamese people fight, the stronger they become, and the more the American aggressors fight, the weaker they become. That is the reason. The Vietnamese people are bound to win, and U.S. imperialism is bound to be defeated. That is also the reason.

    越战越善战
    越南南方古芝县军民在今年一月份反“扫荡”的战斗中取得了巨大的胜利，在南越人民抗美救国的战斗史上写下了光辉的一页。南越《解放军报》总结了这次大捷的战斗经验。这些丰富的经验，不仅是越南人民的宝贵的财富，而且也是全世界革命人民的财富。
    人民战争是被侵略人民对付美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝。南越人民也和其他一切革命人民一样，并不是一开始就会打仗的。他们从战争中学习战争，一方面吸收了前人的经验，另一方面不断积累自己的经验，这样他们就从不善于进行人民战争，变成了善于进行人民战争。南越人民在同美国侵略者的搏斗中，通过自己的实践，在运用人民战争的战略战术上，创造了许多经验，进一步充实了人民战争的经验宝库。
    当然，在战争中敌人也会取得一些经验的，即使是失败的经验。他们也会修改自己的战略和战术，以图避免新的失败。但是，美帝国主义的根本弱点决定了，不管它增加多少兵力和现代化武器，也不管它怎样变换战略和战术，都没有办法对付人民战争。相反的，南越人民却必然地在人民战争中越锻炼越成熟，越顽强，不断创造出打败美国侵略者及其走狗的新的战略、战术，弥补武器等等缺陷，克服一切困难，取得最后的胜利。南越人民越战越强，美国侵略者越战越弱，道理就在这里。越南人民必胜，美帝国主义必败，道理也就在这里。
