    A Good Play Reflecting Contradictions Among the People
    ——Watching the Henan Opera "People Rejoice, Horses Neigh"
   　Zhang Dongchuan
    "People Rejoice, Horses Neigh," through a seemingly ordinary event of raising livestock, profoundly reflects the struggle between two roads on the agricultural front in today's increasingly deep development of the socialist revolution; reveals the unparalleled power of socialism and the inevitable historical trend of capitalism's demise; and showcases the spiritual outlook of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the process of this struggle. It shapes the image of Wu Guangxing, an old poor peasant who is old in years but young at heart and of noble character; and criticizes Liu Zide, a well-to-do middle peasant who is short-sighted, greedy for money, and keen on taking the capitalist road.
    The opening scene places Wu Guangxing in the vortex of this struggle: The livestock keeper, well-to-do middle peasant Liu Zide, is discovered to have secretly used the team's livestock to grind flour in partnership with small merchant Xu Fugui (who appears in the play as a representative of capitalist spontaneous forces). Not only does Liu Zide refuse to admit his mistake, but relying on his "superior" livestock-raising skills, he attempts to blackmail the production team by "handing over the whip." Old poor peasant commune member Wu Guangxing, regardless of "offending" his daughter's in-laws, and unafraid of the difficulties of lacking livestock-raising skills, resolutely takes over the whip. From then on, Liu Zide regards Wu Guangxing as his nemesis. Thus, the audience is immediately drawn into the atmosphere of this conflict.
    No difficulty is too great for a hero. Wu Guangxing, with a red heart for the collective cause, raises the livestock very well. Later, Liu Zide mistakenly believes that Wu Guangxing stole the team's feed and reports him to the captain, and publicly slanders Wu Guangxing. Liu Zide's attacks, the masses' incomprehension, and Wu D娘's complaints are undoubtedly a serious test for Wu Guangxing, but the old poor peasant, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, does not put personal gains and losses at heart. All he thinks about is curing the horse and feeding the livestock well. Therefore, the moving scene of exploring the horse at night appears immediately afterwards. Seeing that he loves horses as his life, Wu D娘 is both distressed and angry, and asks him, "Livestock is your life, can't you live without feeding livestock?!" This evokes a painful memory of Wu Guangxing's. This powerfully shows Wu Guangxing's noble spirit of loving socialism; Wu D娘 is also profoundly educated.
    "People Rejoice, Horses Neigh" also makes a beneficial exploration on how to reflect contradictions among the people. I think: Both Liu Zide, who has relatively serious capitalist spontaneous thoughts, and Wu D娘, who is temporarily not highly aware, are portrayed quite successfully.
    The capitalist spontaneous forces' attack on socialism is expressed through the well-to-do middle peasant Liu Zide, and thus Liu Zide becomes the direct opposite of this sharp conflict. Comrade Ren Hongen, who plays Liu Zide, has figured out the character's personality and his performance is very characteristic, vividly expressing the psychological state of the character in a specific environment. For example, the fear hidden beneath his bluster at the time of handing over the whip is vividly shown through the trembling of his hands. For another example, after the secret of secretly leading the team's livestock to grind flour at night is revealed, he sophistically says to the captain, "Didn't you tell me to seize every opportunity?!" Thus, this opportunistic Liu Zide is more concretely characterized. However, the playwright did not lose his position because of this, pushing him into the ranks of the enemy, but based on the principle of "unity-struggle-unity," he not only carried out a deep exposure and condemnation of him, but also patiently educated him from the desire to unite and transform him, and finally pulled him onto the socialist road. However, for Liu Zide, who comes from a well-to-do middle peasant family and whose mind is full of personal wealth, ideological transformation can never be achieved overnight, and there must be a process, and even repetitions. The drama further reveals this process through "selling horses": When Liu Zide is repeatedly educated and realizes the danger of following Xu Fugui on the capitalist road, his thinking has significantly improved, and he wants to find an opportunity to do something "good" for the collective. Just then, a neighboring team comes to buy horses, and Liu Zide actively advocates selling the team's sick horse to the neighboring team as a good horse. He did not expect to be criticized by the captain and Wu Guangxing. Under Wu Guangxing's proposal, the best horse was sold to the neighboring team. At this time, Liu Zide realized that Wu Guangxing not only loved his own team and cared about the development of his own team's production, but also cared about the production of brotherly teams and cared about the socialist construction of the entire country.
    Although Wu D娘 is not the main character in the play, due to Comrade Chang Xiangyu's successful performance, she added a lot of glory to the character and left a deep impression on the audience. Comrade Chang Xiangyu not only has a beautiful and moving singing voice, but also understands the inner activities of the character Wu D娘 in a meticulous way. Therefore, whether she readily agreed to lend livestock to Liu Zide, or went to snatch the water bucket from her old partner; whether it was "persuading" her old partner or worrying about her son's marriage, she grasped it just right. Wu D娘's love from her own family's chickens to the horses in the commune shows the long-term development of his personality.
    What makes this play feel insufficient is: the whole play still seems a little flat, the climax of the drama is not prominent enough; Wu Guangxing lacks initiative in this contradictory struggle with Liu Zide, and the excavation of his rich and noble spiritual world is not deep enough. We believe that the comrades of the Henan Yu Opera Theatre and the Yu Opera Second Troupe of Xuchang Prefecture will continue to improve and achieve perfection in future artistic practice.

    一出反映人民内部矛盾的好戏
    ——看豫剧《人欢马叫》
   　张东川
    《人欢马叫》通过一个看来平常的饲养牲口的事件，比较深刻地反映了在社会主义革命日益深入发展的今天，在农业战线上两条道路的斗争；揭示出社会主义的无比威力和资本主义必然灭亡的历史趋势；展现了在这场斗争进程中贫下中农的精神面貌。为我们塑造了一个人老心红，风格高尚的老贫农吴广兴的形象；批判了鼠目寸光，见钱眼开，热中于走资本主义道路的富裕中农刘自得。
    幕一打开，就把吴广兴置于这场斗争的漩涡之中：饲养员富裕中农刘自得，为与小商贩徐富贵（在剧中是作为资本主义自发势力的代表人物出现的）合伙做生意，偷用队里牲口磨面的事被发现，刘自得非但不承认错误，反凭仗“高人一等”的饲养技术，企图以“交鞭子”来要挟生产队；老贫农社员吴广兴，不顾“得罪”儿女亲家，不怕自己没有饲养大牲口技术的困难，而毅然决然地接过鞭子。从此，刘自得便把吴广兴看成是冤家对头。这样，一开始便把观众引进这场冲突的氛围中。
    天大的困难难不倒英雄汉，吴广兴凭着对集体事业的一颗红心，把牲口喂得很好。后来，刘自得又误以为吴广兴偷队里的饲料而报告队长，并当众诽谤吴广兴。刘自得的攻击，群众的不解，吴大娘的埋怨，对吴广兴来说无疑是个严重的考验，但用毛泽东思想武装起来的老贫农，没有把个人的得失放在心上，他一心想的是给马治好病，喂好牲口。因此，紧接着就出现了深夜探马一场动人的好戏。吴大娘见他爱马如命，又是心疼又是气，便责问他：“牲口是你的命，不喂牲口就不能活啦？！”，从而勾起吴广兴的一段辛酸的回忆。有力地展现出吴广兴的热爱社会主义的崇高精神；吴大娘也受到了深刻的教育。
    《人欢马叫》在如何反映人民内部矛盾上也作了有益的探索。我认为：无论是存有较严重资本主义自发思想的刘自得，还是暂时觉悟不高的吴大娘，塑造得都是相当成功的。
    戏中资本主义自发势力向社会主义的进攻，是通过富裕中农刘自得表现出来的，因而刘自得成为这场尖锐冲突的直接对立面。扮演刘自得的任洪恩同志摸透了人物的性格，表演很有特色，把特定环境中的人物心理状态绘声绘色地表现出来。如交鞭时色厉内荏的心情通过手颤得到了生动地显示。再如，深夜偷偷牵走队里牲口磨面的事败露后，对队长狡辩说：“你不是叫我见缝插针吗？！”这样，就把这个投机取巧的刘自得更为具体地性格化了。但剧作者并没有因此而乱了阵脚，把他推到敌对的行列中，而是本着“团结——斗争——团结”的原则，对他既进行了深刻的揭露鞭挞，又始终从团结他、改造他的愿望出发，对他进行了耐心的教育，终于把他拉到社会主义道路上来。但是，对于刘自得这样一个出身于富裕中农，满脑子个人发财致富的人来说，思想改造绝不可能一蹴而成，必然有一个过程，甚至有反复。戏剧进而通过“卖马”揭示了这个过程：刘自得在受到反复教育，认识到跟着徐富贵走资本主义道路的危险时，思想有了明显的提高，并想找个机会为集体办件“好事”。正好，这时邻队来买马，刘自得便积极主张把队里的病马冒充好马卖给邻队。他没想到反受到队长和吴广兴的批评，在吴广兴的提议下，把最好的马卖给了邻队。这时刘自得才看到：吴广兴不仅是爱自己的队，关心自己队生产的发展，而且还关心兄弟社队的生产，关心整个国家的社会主义建设。
    吴大娘虽然不是剧中的主要人物，但由于常香玉同志成功的表演，给人物增添了不少光采，给观众留下了深刻的印象。常香玉同志不但唱腔优美动人，对吴大娘这个人物的内心活动也体味得细致入微。所以，无论她慨然应允借给刘自得牲口，还是去夺老伴手中的水桶；无论是对老伴的“劝阻”，还是儿子婚事的忧虑，把握得都恰到好处。吴大娘从爱家的鸡到爱社里的马，显示了他性格上的长驱发展。
    这个戏令人感到不足的是：整个戏还显得平了一些，戏剧高潮不够突出；吴广兴在与刘自得这场矛盾斗争中缺乏主动精神，对其丰富的崇高的精神世界挖掘得不够深。我们相信，河南豫剧院、许昌专区豫剧二团的同志们，在今后的艺术实践中将会不断提高，日臻完美。
