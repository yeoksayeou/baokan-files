    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 18th—A survey report by the "Fact-Finding Committee" published in the Indonesian newspaper *Angkatan Bersendjata* on the 10th and 11th revealed horrifying facts about the large-scale massacre and imprisonment of Indonesian Communists and innocent people by Indonesian right-wing forces since October 1st of last year. The "Fact-Finding Committee" was established by a decision of President Sukarno at a meeting of the Supreme Operations Command held on December 23rd of last year. This committee submitted the survey report after conducting investigations in Bali, East Java, Central Java, and North Sumatra from December 27th of last year to January 6th of this year.

    The report stated that, after verifying factual materials, the "Fact-Finding Committee" concluded that the number of deaths in the aforementioned four regions was as follows: Bali, 12,500; East Java, 54,000; Central Java, 10,000; and North Sumatra, 2,000. The total is 78,500.

    Regarding the number of arrests, the report stated that, like the number of deaths, it is difficult to obtain a definitive figure, but after the most careful investigation possible, the estimates are as follows: East Java, estimated at 25,000; Central Java, 70,000; and North Sumatra, 11,000. The total is 106,000.

    The report admitted that these victims were mainly Indonesian Communists and innocent Indonesian people. It stated: "Generally speaking, the aforementioned deceased were clearly the instigators (of the October 1st Movement) or cadres of the Indonesian Communist Party and its mass organizations" and those who died due to "incitement" and "misunderstandings."

    The report stated that local officials who provided the figures of the victims "intentionally or unintentionally attempted to conceal or minimize the number of deaths in the reports." It also stated that "many regions have apparently not yet been able to conduct statistics on the victims," and even that "some regions are still in a period of action."

    印度尼西亚右派势力罪恶滔天
    血腥屠杀共产党人和无辜人民
    官方报告承认仅在东爪哇等地就血腥屠杀七万多人
    新华社十八日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚《武装部队报》十日和十一日刊登的“搜集事实委员会”的一份调查报告透露了印度尼西亚右派势力从去年十月一日以来，大规模地屠杀、监禁印度尼西亚共产党人和无辜人民的骇人听闻的事实。“搜集事实委员会”是苏加诺总统在去年十二月二十三日举行的最高行动指挥部的会议上决定成立的。这个委员会在去年十二月二十七日到今年一月六日，到巴厘、东爪哇、中爪哇和北苏门答腊等地进行调查以后提出了这份调查报告。
    报告说，通过对事实材料进行核实的调查，“搜集事实委员会”得出结论说，上述四个地区的死亡人数是：巴厘一万二千五百人，东爪哇五万四千人，中爪哇一万人，北苏门答腊二千人。总共是七万八千五百人。
    在谈到被捕人数时，报告说，和死亡人数一样，关于被捕人数，也难以得出一个肯定的数目，但是在通过尽可能仔细的调查以后，可以估计如下：东爪哇估计是二万五千人，中爪哇七万人，北苏门答腊一万一千人。总共十万六千人。
    报告承认，这些被害者主要是印度尼西亚共产党人和印度尼西亚无辜人民。它说：“一般说来，上述死者显然是（十·一运动的）主使人或者印度尼西亚共产党及其群众组织的干部”和由于“煽动”和“误会”而死亡的人。
    报告说，提供被害者的数字的地方官员“有意或者无意地企图掩盖或缩小报告中的死亡人数。”并说，“有许多地区显然到现在还未能就受害人进行统计”，甚至“有些地区，目前还处于行动时期。”
