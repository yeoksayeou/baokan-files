    What is the true nature of the "joint action" so enthusiastically promoted by the Soviet leaders? The television interview given by U.S. Vice President Humphrey on January 16 once again provides an answer to this question.

    Humphrey, accompanied by U.S. Secretary of State Rusk, recently held talks with Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Kosygin in New Delhi. This was a significant meeting between the leaders of the Soviet and American governments since Khrushchev's downfall. Humphrey said that the talks were "frank, straightforward, polite, and reasonable," and that they were "consistently helpful to the common cause of peace." Humphrey also stated that "looking ahead in the coming years," U.S.-Soviet relations "can be improved and should be improved."

    If Humphrey's remarks were somewhat veiled regarding the truth of U.S.-Soviet collusion and the Soviet leaders' capitulationist line, then some recent statements by high-ranking American officials have been much more direct. On December 7, 1965, Rusk said, "We can take the Soviet side's talk about peaceful coexistence seriously." Three days later, Harriman added that the United States and the Soviet Union were "closer," and that in the future, they would "work together in parallel." On October 21, 1965, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Cleveland, spoke even more bluntly, praising the Soviet Union for "becoming a law-abiding citizen in the world family."

    The irrefutable facts prove that the new Soviet leaders are going even further than Khrushchev on the road of U.S.-Soviet cooperation. The counter-revolutionary global strategy of U.S. imperialism is receiving the active cooperation of the Soviet leaders.

    Recently, the United States and the Soviet Union have taken a series of actions in Asia, which Western newspapers have euphemistically described as "parallel but not conflicting." The Johnson administration's actively peddled "unconditional discussions," the widely publicized Tashkent talks, and the rapidly developing "Japanese-Soviet friendship" are all new chapters in the mutual collusion between the Soviet leaders and U.S. imperialism in Asia.

    On the Vietnam issue, the Soviet leaders have consistently colluded with U.S. imperialism, running errands for Johnson's "peace talks" conspiracy.

    The Soviet delegation to Vietnam, led by Shelepin, arrived in Hanoi amidst the Johnson administration's deafening "peace offensive." What attitude did Shelepin express toward this great deception and great conspiracy of U.S. imperialism? He neither exposed it nor condemned it. On the contrary, the Soviet press, at this very moment, was deliberately touting the so-called "Tashkent spirit," advocating "solving problems through negotiations," and saying that the Tashkent talks "go far beyond the Indian subcontinent" and have "important significance" for the entire Southeast Asia. This kind of propaganda by the Soviet press is nothing more than an attempt to force the Vietnamese people to sit at the negotiating table with the American aggressors while allowing them to occupy the South.

    If it was inconvenient for Shelepin to openly echo the Johnson government's "peace offensive" in Hanoi, then the Soviet leaders did so very blatantly during the Soviet-Japanese talks in Moscow. The Soviet-Japanese joint communiqué did not mention the U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam, but rather vaguely stated that both sides "emphasized that the situation in Vietnam is a threat to peace." This kind of argument from the Japanese reactionaries is not surprising. What is strange is that the Soviet leaders joined them in chorus. People cannot help but ask: On the Vietnam issue, it is clearly the American aggression that constitutes "a threat to peace." How can the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation "threaten" peace? The Soviet leaders, without distinguishing between aggressors and the aggressed, between justice and injustice, joined the Japanese reactionaries in condemning "the situation in Vietnam as a threat to peace." This once again proves that they are trying to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle under the guise of "maintaining peace" and bring the Vietnam issue into the orbit of U.S.-Soviet cooperation.

    U.S. imperialism, at least, understands the intentions of the Soviet leaders. After the Kosygin-Humphrey talks, Bundy, Special Assistant to the U.S. President, said frankly on January 16, "For a long time, we have been very clear that the Soviet government hopes to achieve a peaceful settlement there [referring to Vietnam]." Humphrey also openly stated his hope that the Soviet Union would "exert a moderating influence" on the Vietnam issue. It is all too clear what kind of dirty collusion the Soviet leaders are engaging in with U.S. imperialism.

    The Tashkent talks, initiated by the Soviet leaders, were also a product of U.S.-Soviet collusion. As soon as Moscow proposed holding the talks, Washington immediately expressed its approval. After the signing of the "Tashkent Declaration," the Johnson government immediately warmly welcomed it. Humphrey said unabashedly in a television interview, "This was done very well"; "I expressed our government's praise to Mr. Kosygin."

    During the Indo-Pakistani conflict, the United States and the Soviet Union unanimously encouraged and incited the Indian aggressors, and brutally pressured Pakistan, which was taking self-defensive actions to safeguard its sovereignty. Why, after that, did they cooperate closely and try their best to bring the Indian and Pakistani leaders together to promote "reconciliation" between the two sides? To put it bluntly, the Soviet leaders spared no effort in concocting a "Tashkent spirit," with the sole purpose of continuing to protect the Indian reactionaries and, in doing so, promoting their so-called "peaceful coexistence" general line, in order to weaken the anti-imperialist movement of solidarity in Asia and Africa. U.S. imperialism, on the other hand, attempted to use the Soviet leaders to interfere in Asian affairs, jointly oppose China, and serve its global strategy. The *New York Times* stated that the interests of the United States and the Soviet Union on the Indo-Pakistani issue "are consistent with each other," which reveals the origin of this joint action.

    The Soviet leaders' recent intensified collusion with the Japanese reactionaries is an important step in their pursuit of the line of U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world.

    Since last year, the Soviet leaders have been eager to express "friendship" to the Sato government. The recent Soviet-Japanese talks were a grand performance by the Soviet leaders in pursuit of "Japanese-Soviet friendship." The Soviet leaders, disregarding the fact that Japanese militarist forces are stepping up their revival with American support, ignoring the fact that the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" is an instrument of aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and China, actually complimented the Japanese reactionaries as a "stabilizing force in Asia" and "holding a leading position in Asia." They even hoped that the Japanese reactionaries would "take action in close contact with" the Soviet Union "in the international community." As a result of the Soviet-Japanese talks in Moscow, the two countries signed one agreement after another. American newspapers wrote, "A warm breeze is blowing between Moscow and Tokyo."

    The Soviet leaders' eagerness to pursue cooperation with the Japanese reactionaries is closely coordinated with the U.S. imperialist policy of stepping up the support of Japanese militarism. Gromyko stated clearly: "Promoting the friendly development of Japanese-Soviet relations will not cause any damage to (Japan's) relations with third countries." He further explained: "The so-called third country refers to Western powers." This means that Soviet leaders' cooperation with the Japanese reactionaries is conducted on the premise of recognizing the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty." It is not difficult to see that Soviet-Japanese cooperation is actually an extension of U.S.-Soviet cooperation.

    The actions of the Soviet leaders on the Vietnam issue, the Indo-Pakistani issue, and the Japanese issue are fully in line with the needs of U.S. imperialism, especially the needs of U.S. imperialism's policy of encircling China.

    For a long time, U.S. imperialism has been painstakingly managing to build a crescent-shaped "encirclement" around China, stretching from India in the west to Japan in the east. Occupying our territory of Taiwan, establishing the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, reviving the forces of Japanese militarism, signing the "Japan-South Korea Treaty," piecing together a Northeast Asia military alliance, supporting the Indian reactionaries, sending large numbers of troops to occupy South Vietnam, and carrying out armed aggression against various Indochinese countries—all of these are moving toward the realization of this goal. However, with the growing strength of China and its increasing international prestige, with the vigorous development of the national independence movement in Asia, this "encirclement" of U.S. imperialism has become fragmented and incomplete. Under these circumstances, the Khrushchev revisionists emerged and took on the task of helping U.S. imperialism repair this "encirclement." This is what Humphrey meant when he said: "The Soviet Union is trying to build a wall of containment around Communist China."

    The Soviet leaders' affection for the Indian reactionaries is aimed at making them a tool for U.S.-Soviet joint anti-China efforts and a flank in encircling China.

    The Soviet leaders are so vigorously promoting the Johnson government's "peace talks" fraud, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to stop their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation and turn Indochina into a base for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to jointly "contain" China.

    The Soviet leaders' "friendship" with the Japanese reactionaries is also out of the need to oppose China. The Japanese reactionaries fully understand this. The Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that the Soviet Union's recent special expression of goodwill toward Japan is "a link in the strategic chain of isolating Communist China." It is no accident that the focus of Japan's military deployment has shifted from the north to the west, which is closer to China, and that it is stepping up the construction of missile bases in Kyushu.

    In order to help U.S. imperialism stabilize its foothold in encircling China, the Soviet leaders even sent representatives to sit on the same bench at meetings with delegations from U.S. imperialism's running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the puppet groups in South Vietnam and South Korea, engaging in the "cause" of "developing Asia."

    Recently, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Brezhnev led a large delegation to Mongolia. It is obvious what they are up to.

    In short, the Khrushchev revisionists are capable of doing anything to cooperate with U.S. imperialism against China.

    While the Soviet leaders are intensifying their collusion with U.S. imperialism in Asia, they are also further pursuing their policy of appeasement in Europe.

    On the European issue, Khrushchev at least let off a few empty cannons about "concluding a peace treaty with Germany" and made some small moves on the West Berlin issue. After the new Soviet leaders came to power, they ceased the drumbeating and tried to "freeze" the status quo in Europe. After Harriman's visit to the Soviet Union last July, he said confidently, "The Soviets want to maintain the status quo in Europe and will not be interested in solving the German issue for the next five or six years." In early November last year, the U.S. Army Command in Europe officially announced, "The Berlin crisis is over, and no new Eastern threat is expected to appear immediately." In fact, the U.S. policy of supporting West German revanchist forces has not changed. The situation in Europe has not truly eased. The United States temporarily shelved the multilateral nuclear force plan centered on the nuclear arming of West Germany, which was just a gesture. However, the Soviet leaders have been making concessions step by step on the European issue. This has greatly helped U.S. imperialism's global strategy. It was under these circumstances that the U.S. troops stationed in Western Europe were transferred to the east in a continuous stream to South Vietnam.

    In the face of these numerous facts, no matter what banner or sign the Soviet leaders are waving, they cannot conceal the fact that they have already degenerated into accomplices of U.S. imperialism in opposing the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and opposing the revolutionary people of the world.

    Is the United States completely satisfied with the Soviet leaders' efforts to serve its global strategy so diligently? No, it is not completely satisfied. At present, what U.S. imperialism particularly feels dissatisfied with is that the Soviet leaders have not completed their mission on the Vietnam issue. They have used all kinds of methods of pressure and deception, but they have not been able to get the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and accept Johnson's "unconditional discussions." Therefore, U.S. imperialism both praises and complains about the Soviet leaders. Humphrey's remarks are representative in this regard. He said that the Soviet leaders "are still not exactly a dear partner of the United States."

    The Soviet leaders have not completely satisfied the United States, not because they do not want to, but because they cannot. Their pursuit of a capitulationist line toward U.S. imperialism violates the interests of the people of the world, including the Soviet people, and is bound to encounter numerous difficulties.

    How can the Soviet leaders possibly force the Vietnamese people to abandon their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation and surrender? The Vietnamese people do not want to be slaves of a conquered nation and are determined not to fall for Johnson's "peace talks" fraud. As President Ho Chi Minh pointed out in his recent letter to the heads of government of various countries, as long as there are American aggressors on Vietnamese soil, the Vietnamese people will resolutely fight against the American aggressors. In the face of the heroic Vietnamese people's persistence in the struggle, the Soviet leaders' Munich conspiracy will be increasingly exposed by the people.

    How can the Soviet leaders possibly extinguish the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world? As long as there is imperialism and reaction, oppressed people and oppressed nations will always rise up in revolution. This is the great trend of world historical development. U.S. imperialism cannot stop it, and the Soviet leaders cannot stop it, and they cannot stop it even if they unite.

    How can the Soviet leaders completely succeed in helping U.S. imperialism encircle China and "contain" China? Today's China is not the old China before liberation, nor the China in the early days after liberation, but a socialist country that adheres to Marxism-Leninism and is becoming increasingly strong. China has more and more friends, its international prestige is getting higher and higher, and it is playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. China is the biggest obstacle to U.S. imperialism in implementing its counter-revolutionary strategy of seeking hegemony in the world, and it is also the biggest obstacle to the Soviet leaders in implementing their general line of U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world.

    The line of U.S.-Soviet cooperation pursued by the Soviet leaders is also difficult to pass among the great Soviet people. It is impossible to imagine that the Soviet people, who have been taught for a long time by Lenin and Stalin and have a glorious revolutionary tradition, will allow the Soviet leaders to unscrupulously implement the capitulationist line toward U.S. imperialism, which harms the interests of the people of the world and the Soviet people.

    For the above reasons, in the process of implementing the capitulationist line toward U.S. imperialism, the Soviet leaders, compelled by the situation, have had to play more two-faced tricks and make some anti-imperialist gestures in order to deceive the world. This shows the cunning of the Soviet leaders, but it also shows their weakness.

    U.S. imperialism sees through the weaknesses of the Soviet leaders. U.S. imperialism both understands and is somewhat uneasy about the Soviet leaders' two-faced tricks. Sometimes they praise them, and sometimes they whip them, all in order to make the Soviet leaders serve U.S. imperialism better and cooperate better.

    The past and recent facts all show that the Soviet leaders, despite being so cunning, still have to dance to the tune of U.S. imperialism after all. They do not hesitate to betray the interests of the Soviet people and the people of socialist countries, do not hesitate to betray the interests of the people of the world, do not hesitate to sell out Vietnam, and do not hesitate to unite with the United States against China, going further and further down the road of betrayal.

    Humphrey's television interview once again exposed the mask of the Soviet leaders. Who exactly are the Soviet leaders shouting about "joint action" with? They are not united with Marxists-Leninists, not united with the revolutionary people of the world, but united with U.S. imperialism, the greatest aggressor of our time. By doing so, the Soviet leaders can only further expose their betrayal. The people of the world will never forgive them, and the Soviet people will never forgive them either. They will not escape the punishment of history.

### 苏联领导同谁联合行动？

    苏联领导同谁联合行动？
    观察家
    苏联领导大肆鼓吹的“联合行动”是个什么货色？美国副总统汉弗莱一月十六日的电视谈话，又一次给人们提供了答案。
    汉弗莱最近由美国国务卿腊斯克陪同，在新德里同苏联部长会议主席柯西金举行了会谈。这是赫鲁晓夫下台以来苏美政府领导人的一次重要接触。汉弗莱说，这次会谈“是坦率的、直言不讳的，是有礼貌的、讲道理的”，“对和平的共同事业始终有帮助”。汉弗莱还说，“展望今后几年”，美苏关系“能够改善而且应该改善”。
    如果说，汉弗莱的这番话，对于美苏勾结的真相，对于苏联领导人的投降主义路线，说得还比较含蓄的话，那么，美国一些高级官员最近的一些谈话，就要直率得多。一九六五年十二月七日，腊斯克说：“我们可以认真看待苏联方面关于和平共处的谈论”。三天以后，哈里曼又说：美国和苏联“靠近”了，今后美苏将“一起平行地工作”。一九六五年十月二十一日，美国驻北大西洋集团首席代表克利夫兰讲得更露骨，他夸奖苏联“变成了世界大家庭中的守法公民”。
    无可辩驳的事实证明，在美苏合作的道路上，苏联新领导比赫鲁晓夫走得更远。美帝国主义的反革命全球战略，得到苏联领导人的积极配合。
    最近，美苏在亚洲采取了一系列被西方报刊美其名曰“并行不悖”的行动。积极兜售的约翰逊政府的
  “无条件讨论”，大吹大擂的塔什干会谈，以及急转直下的“日苏亲善”，这些就是苏联领导人同美帝国主义在亚洲相互勾结的新篇章。
    在越南问题上，苏联领导人一直同美帝国主义串通一气，为约翰逊的“和谈”阴谋奔走效劳。
    以谢列平为首的苏联访越代表团，是在约翰逊政府甚嚣尘上的“和平攻势”声中到达河内的。对于美帝国主义的这个大骗局、大阴谋，谢列平表示了什么态度呢？他既不加以揭露，更不予以谴责。相反地，苏联报刊却在此时此刻别有用心地吹嘘所谓“塔什干精神”，鼓吹“通过谈判解决”问题，说什么塔什干会谈“远远超出印度半岛的范围”，对整个东南亚“也有重要意义”。苏联报刊的这种宣传，无非是要越南人民在听任美国侵略者霸占南方的情况下，同它坐到谈判桌上来。
    如果说，谢列平在河内还不便于公开同约翰逊政府的“和平攻势”相呼应，那么，在莫斯科的苏日会谈中，苏联领导人就做得十分露骨了。苏日联合公报只字不提美帝国主义对越南的侵略，而是笼统地说什么苏日双方“强调指出越南的事态是对和平的威胁”。这种论调出诸于日本反动派之口，是不足为奇的。奇怪的是，苏联领导人竟同他们齐声合唱。人们不禁要问：在越南问题上，构成“对和平的威胁”的明明是美国的侵略，越南人民的抗美救国斗争，怎么会“威胁”和平呢？苏联领导人不分侵略与被侵略，不分正义和非正义，同日本反动派一起谴责“越南的事态是对和平的威胁”，这就再一次证明，他们企图打着“维护和平”的幌子，扑灭越南人民的斗争烈火，把越南问题纳入美苏合作的轨道。
    对于苏联领导人的这种意图，美帝国主义至少是心领神会的。在柯西金和汉弗莱会谈之后，美国总统特别助理邦迪一月十六日直言不讳地说，“长期以来，我们一直很清楚：苏联政府是希望在那里（按：指越南）取得和平解决的。”汉弗莱还公开表示，希望苏联在越南问题上“起促使缓和的影响”。苏联领导人在同美帝国主义进行什么样的肮脏勾搭，实在是再明白不过的了。
    苏联领导人所倡议的塔什干会谈，也是美苏合谋的产物。莫斯科刚一提出举行会谈的建议，华盛顿立即表示赞许。在“塔什干宣言”签订以后，约翰逊政府又马上热烈欢迎。汉弗莱在电视谈话中毫不隐讳地说：“这件事干得很好”；“我向柯西金先生表达了我们政府的赞扬”。
    在印巴冲突时，美苏一致鼓舞和怂恿印度侵略者，对为维护主权而采取自卫行动的巴基斯坦粗暴地施加压力。为什么在这之后，它们又密切配合，竭力撮合印巴首脑坐到一起，促使双方“和解”呢？拆穿了说，苏联领导人花费九牛二虎之力，炮制出一个“塔什干精神”，无非是要继续袒护印度反动派，并借此宣扬他们的所谓“和平共处”总路线，以削弱亚非地区的团结反帝运动。美帝国主义则企图利用苏联领导人插手亚洲事务，共同反对中国，为它的全球战略服务。《纽约时报》说，美苏在印巴问题上的利益“是相互一致的”，这就一语道破了这种联合行动的原委。
    苏联领导人最近加紧同日本反动派勾结，是他们推行苏美合作主宰世界路线的一个重要步骤。
    去年以来，苏联领导人就迫不及待地向佐藤政府表示“亲善”。最近的苏日会谈，就是苏联领导人追求
  “日苏亲善”的大表演。苏联领导人不顾日本军国主义势力在美国支持下加紧复活，无视“日韩条约”是针对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中国的侵略工具，竟然恭维日本反动派是“亚洲的安定力量”，“在亚洲居于领导地位”。他们甚至希望日本反动派同苏联“在国际社会上采取密切的联系而行动”。苏日莫斯科会谈的结果，两国签订了一个又一个的协定。美国报纸写道：“一股暖洋洋的微风，正在莫斯科和东京之间吹拂”。
    苏联领导人如此迫不及待地追求同日本反动派的合作，是同美帝国主义加紧扶植日本军国主义的政策密切配合的。葛罗米柯说得明明白白：“增进日苏关系的友好发展，不会对（日本）同第三国的关系造成任何的损害”。他进一步解释：“所谓第三国是指西方大国而言”。这就是说，苏联领导人同日本反动派的合作，是在承认“美日安全体制”的前提下进行的。这就不难看出，苏日合作实际上是苏美合作的延长。
    苏联领导人在越南问题、印巴问题、日本问题上的所作所为，完全适应美帝国主义的需要，特别是适应美帝国主义包围中国政策的需要。
    长期以来，美帝国主义苦心经营，要在中国的周围修筑一道西起印度、东至日本的半月形“包围圈”。占领我国领土台湾，成立东南亚条约组织，复活日本军国主义势力，签订“日韩条约”，拼凑东北亚军事联盟，扶植印度反动派，派遣大批部队侵占南越，武装侵犯印度支那各国，凡此种种，都是向着实现这一目标前进。但是，随着中国的力量日益强大和国际威望日益增长，随着亚洲民族独立运动的蓬勃发展，美帝国主义的这个“包围圈”，已经落得支离破碎，残缺不全。在这种情况下，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者跑了出来，担起了帮助美帝国主义修补这个“包围圈”的工作。这就是汉弗莱所说的：“苏联正试图在共产党中国周围建立一道遏制的墙”。
    苏联领导人如此宠爱印度反动派，目的就在于使它成为美苏联合反华的工具，成为包围中国的一个侧翼。
    苏联领导人如此卖力地为约翰逊政府推销“和谈”骗局，是妄图迫使越南人民停止抗美救国斗争，把印度支那变为美苏共同“遏制”中国的一个阵地。
    苏联领导人同日本反动派如此“亲善”，同样是出于反对中国的需要。对于这一点，日本反动派是完全理解的。日本外务省认为，苏联最近对日本特别表示好意，是“孤立共产党中国的战略上的一个环节”。现在，日本的军事部署的重点，已经从北部转移到同中国接近的西部，并且在九州加紧建立导弹基地，这绝不是偶然的。
    苏联领导人为了帮助美帝国主义稳住包围中国的阵脚，甚至派出代表同美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石匪帮和南越、南朝鲜傀儡集团的代表团坐在一条板凳上开会，搞什么“开发亚洲”的“事业”。
    最近，苏共中央第一书记勃列日涅夫率领一个庞大的代表团访问蒙古。他们搞的是什么名堂，也是显而易见的。
    总之，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为了配合美帝国主义反对中国，是什么事情都干得出来的。
    苏联领导人在亚洲同美帝国主义加紧勾结的同时，在欧洲也进一步推行他们的绥靖主义政策。
    在欧洲问题上，赫鲁晓夫还放过几次“缔结对德和约”的空炮，在西柏林问题上还做过一些小动作。苏联新领导上台以后，偃旗息鼓，力图“冻结”欧洲的现状。哈里曼去年七月访苏后蛮有信心地说，“苏联人希望在欧洲保持现状，今后五六年内不会有兴趣解决德国问题”。去年十一月初，美国驻欧洲陆军司令部正式宣布，“柏林危机已经结束，而且预料马上不会出现新的东方威胁”。其实，美国扶植西德复仇主义势力的政策并没有改变。欧洲的局势并没有真正缓和。美国暂时搁置了以核武装西德为核心的多边核力量计划，只不过是一种姿态。而苏联领导人却在欧洲问题上步步退让。这就给美帝国主义的全球战略帮了大忙。美国驻在西欧的部队源源东调，开赴南越，就是在这种情况下进行的。
    在这些大量的事实面前，不管苏联领导人打的是什么旗号，挂的是什么招牌，都无法掩饰他们早已堕落成为美帝国主义反对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲革命人民，反对世界革命人民的同谋者。
    苏联领导人这样卖力地为美国的全球战略效劳，美国是不是完全满意了呢？不，并不完全满意。在目前，美帝国主义特别感到不满足的是，苏联领导人在越南问题上没有完成任务，他们使尽了又压又骗的手法，也没有能够使越南人民放下武器，接受约翰逊的“无条件讨论”。因此，对 于苏联领导人，美帝国主义是又赞扬，又埋怨。在这方面，汉弗莱的谈话是有代表性的。他说，苏联领导人“仍然算不上是美国的一个亲爱的伙伴”。
    苏联领导人没有使美国完全满意，非不为也，是不能也。他们对美帝国主义实行投降主义路线，违背了世界人民包括苏联人民的利益，不可能不遇到重重的困难。
    苏联领导人怎么可能迫使越南人民放弃抗美救国斗争，而屈膝投降呢？越南人民不愿做亡国奴，决心不上约翰逊“和谈”骗局的当。正如胡志明主席最近给各国政府首脑的信所指出的，只要越南国土上还有美国侵略军，越南人民就坚决为反对美国侵略者而战斗。在英雄的越南人民坚持战斗面前，苏联领导人的慕尼黑阴谋必将越来越为人们所识破。
    苏联领导人怎么可能扑灭世界各国人民的革命斗争呢？世界上只要有帝国主义和反动派，被压迫人民和被压迫民族总是要起来革命的。这是世界历史发展的伟大潮流。美帝国主义阻挡不了，苏联领导人阻挡不了，他们联合起来也阻挡不了。
    苏联领导人想要帮助美帝国主义包围中国，“遏制”中国，这又怎么可能完全办到呢？今天的中国，不是解放前的旧中国，也不是解放初期的中国，而是坚持马克思列宁主义、日益强大起来的社会主义国家。中国的朋友越来越多，国际威望越来越高，在国际事务中发挥的作用越来越大。中国是美帝国主义推行它的称霸全球的反革命战略的最大障碍，也是苏联领导人推行苏美合作主宰世界总路线的最大障碍。
    苏联领导人推行的美苏合作路线，在伟大的苏联人民中间也是难以通过的。不可能设想，经过列宁斯大林长期教导、具有光荣革命传统的苏联人民，竟会听任苏联领导人肆无忌惮地把危害世界人民和苏联人民利益的对美帝国主义的投降主义路线推行到底。
    由于上述这些原因，苏联领导人在实行对美帝国主义的投降主义路线的过程中，迫于形势，不得不更多地玩弄两面手法，作一些反帝的姿态，以迷惑世人耳目。这表现了苏联领导人的狡猾，也表现了他们的虚弱。
    美帝国主义看透了苏联领导人的弱点。美帝国主义对苏联领导人的两面手法，既表示谅解，又有些不放心。他们有的时候夸奖几句，有的时候鞭打几下，都是要苏联领导人为美帝国主义效劳得更好，配合得更好。
    过去和最近的事实都说明，苏联领导人尽管如此狡猾，但毕竟还是要跟着美帝国主义的笛子跳舞的。他们不惜背叛苏联人民和社会主义各国人民的利益，不惜背叛世界人民的利益，不惜出卖越南，不惜联美反华，在叛卖的道路上越走越远。
    汉弗莱的电视谈话，又一次揭下了苏联领导人的面纱。苏联领导人口口声声叫喊的“联合行动”，究竟是同谁联合呢？他们不是同马克思列宁主义者联合，不是同全世界革命人民联合，而是同当代最大的侵略者美帝国主义联合。苏联领导人这样做，只能更加暴露自己背叛的面目。全世界人民决不会饶恕他们，苏联人民也决不会饶恕他们。他们是逃不脱历史的惩罚的。
