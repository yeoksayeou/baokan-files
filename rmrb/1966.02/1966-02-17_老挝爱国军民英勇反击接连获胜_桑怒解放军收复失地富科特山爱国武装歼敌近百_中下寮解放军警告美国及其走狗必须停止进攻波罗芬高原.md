    (Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay dispatch) According to Radio Pathet Lao: The Lao patriotic armed forces and people have achieved successive victories in recent heroic battles against the enemy.
    On February 6, the Liberation Army and guerrillas of Sam Neua province recovered the areas of Hui Ton, Phu Xaleu, and Hui Tao in Sam Neua province. In this battle, more than 50 enemies were eliminated, one 105mm howitzer and a batch of military supplies were seized.
    On January 10, guerrillas in Muang Khoa County, Sam Neua Province, shot down and damaged one American jet fighter each with rifles in combat.
    On January 23, the people's armed forces of Pakse, Lower Laos, fiercely attacked the U.S.-puppet military camp at Pakse Airport with mortars, killing 14 American invaders and 19 puppet soldiers, destroying 3 military vehicles and one 105mm howitzer.
    On January 12, guerrillas and people in Muang Mai County, Attapeu Province, killed more than 50 enemies and wounded many others in counter-sweeping operations.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, February 15) According to Radio Pathet Lao: From February 4 to 7, the patriotic armed forces of Xieng Khouang Province annihilated more than 80 enemies and seized a large number of weapons and military supplies in battles against the U.S. puppet troops.
    The radio said that under the orders of their American masters, the Kong Le forces gathered seven battalions of troops and, under the cover of Thai artillery and American aircraft, launched a frenzied attack on the Phou Kout Mountain and Phou Song areas from February 4 to 7. The Lao People's Liberation Army and the patriotic neutralist forces, who were defending the above areas, fought side by side, heroically striking at the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties.
    The radio said that the Lao patriotic armed forces are still fiercely counterattacking.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, February 16) According to Radio Pathet Lao: The command of the Lao People's Liberation Army of Central and Lower Laos issued a statement on the 13th, warning U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to immediately stop the large-scale offensive against the Bolovens Plateau in Lower Laos, or they will be punished.
    The statement said that since February 9, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have dispatched many battalions of troops, under the cover of artillery, tanks, and American aircraft taking off from Thailand, and directly commanded by American advisors, to launch a large-scale offensive against the Thateng and Lao Ngam areas of the Bolovens Plateau in Laos. Wherever the enemy goes, they carry out barbaric plunder and slaughter, and use aircraft and artillery to destroy houses, temples, and schools, causing great losses to the local people.
    The statement condemned U.S. imperialism for instructing the Vientiane authorities to issue a communique on February 11, groundlessly spreading rumors that troops of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam were operating in the Bolovens Plateau area in order to cover up its crimes. The statement pointed out that this is nothing more than the "stop thief!" trick consistently used by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

    桑怒解放军收复失地富科特山爱国武装歼敌近百
    中下寮解放军警告美国及其走狗必须停止进攻波罗芬高原
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国军民在最近反击敌人的英勇战斗中，接连取得了胜利。
    桑怒省解放军和游击队二月六日收复了桑怒省的会敦、富沙勒和会多等地。在这次战斗中，消灭敌人五十多名，缴获一零五毫米口径的大炮一门和军用物资一批。
    桑怒省芒川科县游击队一月十日在战斗中，用步枪击落击伤美国喷气式飞机各一架。
    老挝下寮巴色市人民武装力量一月二十三日用迫击炮猛烈袭击巴色机场的美伪兵营，打死美国侵略者十四名、伪军十九名，摧毁军车三辆和一零五毫米口径的大炮一门。
    阿速坡省芒梅县游击队和人民一月十二日在反扫荡战斗中，打死敌人五十多名，打伤多名。
    新华社康开十五日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝川圹省爱国武装力量从二月四日到七日，在反击美国仆从军队的战斗中，消灭敌人八十多名，缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    电台说，贡勒部队在美国主子的命令下，集结了七个营的军队，在泰国炮兵和美国飞机的掩护下，从二月四日到七日，向富科特山和富松地区发动猖狂进攻。坚守在上述地区的老挝人民解放军和爱国中立力量的部队，并肩战斗，英勇地打击敌人，给予敌人重大杀伤。
    电台说，目前，老挝爱国武装仍在激烈地进行反击。
    新华社康开十六日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝中寮和下寮人民解放军指挥部十三日发表声明警告美帝国主义及其走狗必须立即停止对下寮波罗芬高原发动的大规模进攻，否则它们将遭到惩罚。
    声明说，从二月九日以来，美帝国主义及其走狗出动了许多营军队，在大炮、坦克和从泰国起飞的美国飞机的掩护下，由美国顾问直接指挥，向老挝波罗芬高原的塔顿、寮岸地区发动了大规模进攻。敌人每到一地，都进行野蛮的掠夺和屠杀，并用飞机、大炮摧毁民房、庙宇和学校，给当地人民造成重大损失。
    声明谴责美帝国主义为了掩盖它的罪行，指使万象当局在二月十一日发表一项公报，毫无根据地造谣说，有越南民主共和国军队正在波罗芬高原地区进行活动。声明指出，这不过是美帝国主义及其走狗一贯采用的“贼喊捉贼”的伎俩而已。
