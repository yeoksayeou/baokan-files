    (Xinhua News Agency, February 4th)  Youth from all circles in the capital held a rally tonight to commemorate "Angola Day" on February 4th and to support the anti-imperialist struggle of the Angolan people and youth.

    The Angolan youth delegation, currently visiting Beijing, was invited to attend the rally.

    Li Wenyi, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Youth Federation, spoke at the meeting. Li Wenyi stated that in the just struggle of the Angolan people, the youth of Beijing, like the youth of the whole country, firmly stand on the side of the Angolan people and youth, and will always be their most loyal and reliable comrades-in-arms.

    Antonio Macedo, head of the Angolan youth delegation, was invited to speak. He said that for five years, the Angolan people have never ceased their armed struggle against Portuguese colonialists. The path of armed struggle is the only path for the Angolan people to achieve liberation from Portuguese colonialist oppression. He condemned U.S. imperialism, the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, for doing its utmost to help the Portuguese colonialists obstruct the national liberation struggle of the Angolan people. He said that in order to push the struggle forward and to achieve final victory, we must not only be vigilant against colonialism, but also against all kinds of conspiracies of U.S. imperialism.

    He said that the struggle of the Angolan people is just, and we are determined to fight, firmly believing that victory will surely belong to us. After his speech, all members of the delegation stood up and shouted: "Rather die unyielding than surrender, fight to the end!"
