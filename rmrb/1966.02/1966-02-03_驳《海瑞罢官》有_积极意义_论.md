    Refuting the Theory That "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" Has "Positive Significance"
    Shao Dingxun
    Abstract: Mr. Lu Yu believes that Hai Rui's standing on the side of the "people" to fight the "officials" in "land return" is commendable. However, since Mr. Lu Yu also believes that the "land return" struggle only benefited small and medium landlords and rich peasants, the praise of "commendable" clearly comes from their mouths. Mr. Lu Yu believes that what played a role in Hai Rui's "judgments" was not the law of the landlord class, but Hai Rui's benevolent governance ideology. Here, Mr. Lu Yu portrays benevolent governance ideology as a "supra-class" thing. Mr. Lu Yu believes that Hai Rui is praised by people of past and present dynasties, and therefore is not merely a tool of the landlord class dictatorship. In fact, those who praised Hai Rui were mainly small and medium landlords and rich peasants. All of this shows that Mr. Lu Yu is speaking from the standpoint of the feudal landlord class.
    After reading Mr. Lu Yu's article "Does 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' Have No Positive Significance?" ("People's Daily," January 19, 1966), we cannot help but ask: From what standpoint is this being said?
    Whom Exactly is Hai Rui's Struggle "Commendable" To?
    Mr. Lu Yu begins by admitting that "the 'people' Hai Rui speaks of refers to those who have not been 'officials,' that is, generally small and medium landlords, rich peasants, and merchants," and then affirms that "Hai Rui's standing on the side of the 'people' to fight the 'officials' is commendable."
    Undoubtedly, "officials" and "gentry" have power and influence, and generally small and medium landlords and rich peasants who have not been "officials" cannot compete with them. Now, suddenly an "official" like Hai Rui comes out to "seek justice" for the small and medium landlords and rich peasants, demanding that officials and gentry "return land." Then, this group of small and medium landlords and rich peasants, seeing their land property "lost and regained," will naturally be emotionally moved. Therefore, the praise of "commendable" clearly comes from the mouths of the general small and medium landlords and rich peasants at that time, and has nothing to do with the landless peasant masses. However, Mr. Lu Yu even asks, "We have to think, Hai Rui himself was an 'official' of the Ming Dynasty, but he stood on the side of the 'people' to fight the 'officials.' Is this a trivial matter, or is it a commendable thing?" Doesn't this clearly show that Mr. Lu Yu is completely speaking from the standpoint of the landlord class? If, in the interrogative language "we have to think" used by Mr. Lu Yu, the word "we" is a pronoun for the landlord class, then of course you have your freedom—you can think whatever you want. But, if you want the working people to "think," then "we" the working people have a different idea from yours—the working people's idea is that only when the peasant masses, under the tyrannical power of feudal rule, rise up to resist regardless of their own safety, is that truly commendable.
    Mr. Lu Yu believes that "Xu Jie and Hai Rui both engaged in land return, but the value of the two cannot be confused." According to him, this is because "Xu Jie engaged in 'land return,' but he himself occupied more land," while "Hai Rui never occupied other people's land, which shows that he was truly for the benefit of the 'people.'" But we believe that the important issue is not whether Hai Rui has occupied other people's land, but whether his policies and measures maintain the interests of the landlord class. Since Hai Rui's "land return" was only for the benefit of small and medium landlords and rich peasants, then from the perspective of the oppressed and exploited laboring masses at that time, and from the perspective of the proletariat today, he really cannot be said to have any "value."
    Mr. Lu Yu flatly denies that Hai Rui's measures were to consolidate the long-term interests of the entire landlord class, believing that his "land return" struggle could "help the broad masses of peasants further see the criminal essence of bureaucratic landlords relying on their power to seize land property," thereby helping the peasant class to unite with small and medium landlords and rich peasants to form a "united front against the most important enemies at that time—bureaucratic landlords and corrupt officials." This is truly a preposterous argument. First, since Mr. Lu Yu admits that the "people" Hai Rui speaks of refers to small and medium landlords and rich peasants, why does he deny that the measures taken by Hai Rui for the benefit of these people serve to consolidate the long-term interests of the entire landlord class? Second, bureaucratic landlords certainly also persecute small and medium landlords and rich peasants, but the most fundamental thing is the oppression and exploitation of the broad masses of peasants; in terms of the crime of oppressing and exploiting the broad masses of peasants, there is really no essential difference between small and medium landlords and rich peasants compared to bureaucratic landlords. If Mr. Lu Yu is standing on the side of the working people, why should he beautify those "upright officials" who maintain the interests of small and medium landlords and rich peasants? Third, the "most important enemy" of the oppressed and exploited classes at that time was the feudal autocratic system; the reason why the feudal dynasty needed to establish officials like governors to "impeach" corrupt officials was only because the behavior of corrupt officials exceeded the exploitation allowed by this system and needed to be restrained in order to maintain the long-term interests of the feudal system. If Mr. Lu Yu is not consciously maintaining the feudal autocratic system, how could he say the above words that violate the most basic common sense of Marxism-Leninism?
    In the section of the article titled "Is 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' Advocating Class Conciliation?", the logic is confused to the extreme. Speculating on his original intention, it seems that he is saying that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is not advocating class conciliation. Why would he come to this conclusion? A closer analysis of his entire section shows that he is more openly advocating the theory of class conciliation than "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office."
    Is Hai Rui's "Benevolent Governance Ideology" "Supra-Class"?
    Mr. Lu Yu had to reluctantly admit in the face of irrefutable facts: "The laws of the feudal dynasty are tools for the landlord class to oppress the peasants." However, he played another set of sophistry, saying that in Hai Rui's "judgments," "what played a role was not the law of the landlord class, but Hai Rui the specific person, that is, Hai Rui's benevolent governance ideology." According to him, "benevolent governance ideology is the most positive part of Confucianism," and this ideology constituted Hai Rui's "most basic force in his lifelong struggle." He believes that "consolidating the landlord class regime and maintaining the interests of this class was indeed Hai Rui's class demand, but when he dealt with many shocking cases, his benevolent governance ideology and sense of responsibility would prevail." This means that although the law is a class law, benevolent governance ideology is above class, and even completely serves the "common people," and Hai Rui's "redressing unjust verdicts" and "seeking justice for the people" are based on this ideology. Here, people cannot help but ask: Is there really a "supra-class" benevolent governance ideology?
    In the history of mankind, every historical period contains various "theories" or "isms." To recognize the essence of these colorful "theories" or "isms," one must firmly grasp the viewpoint of class analysis and the basic thread of class struggle. Everyone knows that Confucius was the founder of the Confucian school. His benevolent governance ideology mainly reflected the wishes and demands of the emerging feudal landlord class. This ideology did play a positive role in promoting the disintegration of the slave owner autocratic politics. But thereafter, it has always been the spiritual tool for the feudal landlord class to implement dictatorship, and its role in this respect is even more extensive and effective than the laws of the feudal dynasty. If it is said that all of Hai Rui's measures were not based on the laws of the Ming Dynasty but on the Confucian benevolent governance ideology, then this precisely shows that he did so in order to more effectively consolidate the landlord class regime. Look, "Not helping the weak, not suppressing the strong, where is the parental care for the people!" This is Hai Rui's benevolent governance ideology. Why "suppress the strong" and "help the weak"? One is to increase grain and taxes for the feudal dynasty, so he said, "If food and clothing are not sufficient, where will the money and grain come from?" The second is to prevent peasant uprisings, so he said, "If food and clothing are not scarce, there is no need to worry about escaping, drifting, or becoming bandits. One move will benefit the people of the entire province, and it is also a grand event for appeasement." Thus, it can be seen that Hai Rui's so-called "love for people," "compassion," etc., are not sincerely loving the common people who are in a serf state, but reflect the feudal landlord class's need for labor and wrap a layer of sweet sugar coating on this class's cruel exploitation. Comrade Mao Zedong said correctly: "Love is a conceptual thing, a product of objective practice. We do not start from concepts at all, but from objective practice. ... There is absolutely no love without reason, nor hatred without reason." ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art") Mr. Lu Yu actually portrays Hai Rui's benevolent governance ideology as a "supra-class" thing, as if it can serve both the oppressing class and the oppressed class. Isn't this a great departure from the Marxist-Leninist theory of class struggle?
    It seems that this is the case: when the theory of class conciliation advocated by "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is fiercely criticized, Mr. Lu Yu cannot help but quickly run out to "seek justice," attempting to wrap "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" seamlessly with Hai Rui's benevolent governance ideology. Unexpectedly, he made a clumsy attempt that backfired. Hai Rui's benevolent governance ideology and the laws of the Ming Dynasty are both superstructures of the feudal economic base at that time, actively serving their own economic base, and there is no essential difference between the two, complementing each other. Mr. Lu Yu's actions bring Comrade Wu Han's viewpoint to an even more absurd level.
    Are "People of Past and Present Dynasties" Truly Praising "Lord Hai, the Upright Official"?
    Mr. Lu Yu found it difficult to accept the correct conclusion that "Hai Rui can only be a tool of the landlord class dictatorship." He asked, "Even if 'upright officials' like Hai Rui cannot jump out of their class circle, are the people of past and present dynasties who praise Hai Rui also doing so out of maintaining the interests of the landlord class?" He thought that this sophistical question could stump the other party, but the dialectics of Marxism-Leninism can never be stumped.
    It should be pointed out that in class society, there are class differences. Since the "people" Hai Rui speaks of refers to small and medium landlords and rich peasants, then the "people" who praise Hai Rui are of course also small and medium landlords and rich peasants. The feudal ruling class has always pretended to be the representatives of all the people. Now Mr. Lu Yu actually equates the landlord class with the broad masses of laboring people. Don't you think this is a completely unscientific statement?
    Even if some of the "people of past and present dynasties" who praise Hai Rui are oppressed and exploited laboring people, that is not surprising. For thousands of years, feudal moral concepts and political ideas have dominated Chinese society, and it is impossible for them not to have an impact on some laboring people. This part of the laboring people is tempted by empty and deceptive promises, and for a while echoes what others say, and it is difficult to understand and accept the ideas that most accurately reflect their economic conditions and best represent their true interests. But this does not mean that they do so truly "out of maintaining the interests of the landlord class." No, absolutely not! The interests of the peasant masses and the interests of the landlord class are irreconcilable. The reason why they also shout "Lord Hai, the Upright Official" is only because they are not yet clear about the situation under certain historical conditions.
    True, as Mr. Lu Yu said, the peasants under feudal rule "place infinite illusions on the reality at that time." But it must be pointed out that these illusions are mainly spread by politicians and thinkers of the feudal ruling class. In order to maintain the long-term stability of their class, they cannot but create various illusions and spread various fantasies in front of the masses, and at the same time, they have to cunningly seek the support of some of the masses who have not yet awakened. And our Mr. Wu Han and Mr. Lu Yu are so gullible that they propagate the fantasies spread by the feudal ruling class. Don't you think you are precisely acting as apologists for the feudal landlord class?
    When studying the history of class struggle, one must firmly remember a passage said by Lenin. Lenin said: "All oppressing classes, in order to maintain their rule, need two kinds of social functions: one is the function of the executioner, and the other is the function of the priest. The executioner suppresses the resistance and riots of the oppressed. The priest comforts the oppressed, paints a picture for them of reducing pain and sacrifice under the condition of preserving class rule..., thereby making them endure this rule, making them abandon revolutionary action, diluting their revolutionary enthusiasm, and undermining their revolutionary determination." ("Complete Works of Lenin," Volume 21, page 208) Judging from various relevant historical materials, Hai Rui, this "upright official," performed the function of a priest to a greater extent. It is not difficult to recognize the function of the executioner; it is more difficult to see through the hypocritical face of the priest. This is the reason why some of the "people of past and present dynasties" are confused by "upright officials," and it is also the reason why "Hai Rui plays" "endure" among some people. Failing to see through Hai Rui's hypocritical face, failing to recognize the essence of Hai Rui's entire actions to maintain the interests of the landlord class, cannot be called a "historicalistic scholarly attitude."

    驳《海瑞罢官》有“积极意义”论
    邵鼎勋
    提要　陆雨先生认为，海瑞站在民的一边与官进行“退田”的斗争是难能可贵的。但是，由于陆雨先生也认为“退田”斗争只有利于中小地主和富农，所以“难能可贵”这一赞词显然出于他们之口。陆雨先生认为，海瑞在“断案”时起作用的不是地主阶级的法律，而是海瑞的仁政主义思想。在这里，陆雨先生把仁政主义思想说成是一个“超阶级”的东西。陆雨先生认为，海瑞得到前朝后代的人歌颂，因而不只是地主阶级专政的工具。事实上，歌颂海瑞的主要是中小地主和富农。所有这些，都说明陆雨先生是站在封建地主阶级立场上说话的。
    读了陆雨先生的《〈海瑞罢官〉没有积极意义吗？》（《人民日报》一九六六年一月十九日）一文，我们禁不住要问：这是站在什么立场上说的话？
    海瑞的斗争究竟对谁“是难能可贵的”？
    陆雨先生一开始就承认“海瑞说的‘民’是指没有做过‘官’的人，即一般中小地主，富农和商人”，然后就肯定说，“海瑞站在‘民’一边向‘官’作斗争，是难能可贵的”。
    毫无问题，“官”和“绅”有权有势，一般没有做过“官”的中小地主和富农是敌不过他们的，现在忽然有一个做“官”的海瑞出来替中小地主和富农“打抱不平”，要官绅“退田”，那末，这批中小地主和富农看到自己的田产“失而复得”，当然就会在内心上激动。因此，“难能可贵”这一赞词显然出之于当时一般中小地主和富农之口，同贫无立锥之地的农民群众是丝毫也不相干的。但是，陆雨先生竟追问道：“我们得想一想，海瑞本人是明朝的‘官’，却站在‘民’的一边向‘官’作斗争，这究竟是微不足道的事呢，还是难能可贵的事呢？”这不是清清楚楚地说明了，陆雨先生是完全站在地主阶级立场上说话吗？如果在陆雨先生所使用的“我们得想一想”这一追问口语中“我们”两字是地主阶级的代名词，那当然有你的自由——你爱怎么想就怎么想。但是，要是你要劳动人民“想一想”，那末“我们”劳动人民就同你的想法不一样——劳动人民的想法是，只有农民群众在封建统治的淫威下奋不顾身地起来抗争，这才是难能可贵的。
    陆雨先生认为，“徐阶和海瑞同样搞了退田，两者的价值却不能混为一谈”。据他说，这是因为“徐阶搞了‘退田’，自己却占了更多的田”，而“海瑞却没有占过别人的田，这说明他是真正地为了‘民’的利益”。但是我们认为，重要的问题不在于海瑞有没有占过别人的田，而在于他的政策和措施是不是维护地主阶级的利益。既然海瑞的“退田”只是为了中小地主和富农的利益，那末在当时被压迫被剥削的劳动群众看来，在今天无产阶级看来，他实在谈不到有什么“价值”。
    陆雨先生一口否定海瑞的措施是为了巩固整个地主阶级的长远利益，认为他的“退田”斗争可以“帮助广大农民进一步看清官僚地主依仗权势占夺田产的罪恶本质”，从而帮助农民阶级去联络中小地主和富农组成一个“对付当时最主要敌人——官僚地主和贪官污吏的统一战线”。这真是一种奇谈怪论。第一，陆雨先生既然承认海瑞说的“民”是指中小地主和富农，为什么又否定海瑞为这些人的利益所采取的措施即是为巩固整个地主阶级长远利益而服务呢？第二，官僚地主固然也迫害中小地主和富农，但最根本的还是对广大农民群众的压迫和剥削；就压迫和剥削广大农民群众的罪恶来说，中小地主和富农同官僚地主相比，实在没有本质上的区别。如果陆雨先生是站在劳动人民一边的话，为什么要如此美化那些维护中小地主和富农利益的“清官”呢？第三，当时被压迫被剥削阶级的“最主要的敌人”是封建专制制度；封建王朝之所以需要设立象巡抚之类的官员去“弹劾”贪官污吏，只不过是因为贪官污吏的行为超过了这个制度所允许的剥削制度，需要加以约束，以维护封建制度的长远利益。如果陆雨先生不是有意识地维护封建专制制度的话，怎么会说出以上违反马克思列宁主义起码的常识的话来呢？
    在以《〈海瑞罢官〉是宣扬阶级调和吗？》为标题的这段文章中，逻辑混乱，达于极点。推测他的原意，似乎是说《海瑞罢官》并不是宣扬阶级调和。为什么会得出这个结论呢？细加分析他的全段文章就可以看出，原来他比《海瑞罢官》更加公开地在宣扬着阶级调和论。
    海瑞的“仁政主义思想”是“超阶级”的吗？
    陆雨先生在无可辩驳的事实面前不得不勉强承认：“封建王朝的法律是地主阶级欺压农民的工具”。然而，他却玩弄了另一套诡辩术，说什么海瑞在“断案”时“起着作用的不是地主阶级的法律，而是海瑞这个具体的人，即海瑞的仁政主义思想”。据他说，“仁政主义思想是儒家学说中最积极的部分”，这种思想构成了海瑞“一生斗争中最基本的力量”。他认为，“巩固地主阶级政权和维护这个阶级的利益确是海瑞的阶级要求，但当他处理到许许多多惊心触目的案件的时候，他的仁政主义思想和责任感就会占上风”。这意思就是说：尽管法律是阶级的法律，仁政主义思想却是超乎阶级之上的、甚至是完全为“小民”服务的，而海瑞的“平冤狱”、“为民昭雪”，就是以这种思想为基础的。这里，人们不禁要反问一句：究竟有没有“超阶级”的仁政主义思想呢？
    在一部人类史上，每一个历史时期，都包含着各色各样的“学说”或“主义”，要认清这些五光十色的“学说”或“主义”的实质，就必须牢牢把握住阶级分析的观点和阶级斗争这一基本线索。大家知道，孔子是儒家学派的创始者。他的仁政主义思想主要是反映了新兴的封建地主阶级的愿望和要求。这种思想在促成奴隶主专制政治的解体方面，的确起过积极的作用。但是过此以往，它一直就是封建地主阶级实行专政的精神工具，它在这方面的作用甚至比封建王朝的法律还要更为广泛，更为有效。如果说海瑞的一切措施不是根据朱明王朝的法律而是根据儒家的仁政主义思想，那末这倒恰恰说明了他这样做是为了更为有效地巩固地主阶级政权。试看，“弱不为扶，强不为抑，安在其为民父母哉！”这就是海瑞的仁政主义思想。为什么要“抑强”、“扶弱”呢？一是为了替封建王朝增刮钱粮，所以他说，“衣食不充，钱粮何出？”二是为了防止农民起义，所以他说，“衣食不窘，可无为逃流为盗贼之忧。一举而合省之民均有利焉，是亦抚绥一盛举也”。由此可见，海瑞的所谓“爱人之心”、“恻隐之心”等等，并非真情实意地有爱于身处农奴状态的老百姓，而是反映了封建地主阶级对劳动力的需要，并为这个阶级的残酷剥削裹上一层甜甜蜜蜜的糖衣。毛泽东同志说得对：“爱是观念的东西，是客观实践的产物。我们根本上不是从观念出发，而是从客观实践出发。……世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”（《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》）陆雨先生竟然把海瑞的仁政主义思想说成是一个“超阶级”的东西，仿佛它既可以为压迫阶级服务，又可以为被压迫阶级服务。这岂不是同马克思列宁主义的阶级斗争理论大相背离吗？
    看来事情就是这样：当《海瑞罢官》所宣扬的阶级调和论遭到猛烈批判时，陆雨先生就情不自禁地赶快跑出来“打抱不平”，企图以海瑞的仁政主义思想把《海瑞罢官》包得天衣无缝。不料弄巧成拙。海瑞的仁政主义思想和朱明王朝的法律，同为当时封建经济基础的上层建筑，积极服务于自己的经济基础，两者之间，相辅相成，并没有任何本质上的区别。陆雨先生这样做，把吴晗同志的观点弄到更为荒谬的地步。
   “前朝后代的人民”是不是真正歌颂“海青天”？
    陆雨先生对于“海瑞只能是地主阶级专政的工具”这一正确论断，感到很难接受。他反问道：“就算海瑞那样的‘清官’跳不出他们的阶级圈子，那末歌颂海瑞的前朝后代的人民是不是也是出于维护地主阶级利益呢？”他以为这一诡辩式的问法就可以把对方难倒了，但是马克思列宁主义的辩证法是始终难不倒的。
    应该指出，在阶级社会里，是存在着阶级差别的。既然海瑞所说的“民”是指中小地主和富农，那末歌颂海瑞的“民”当然也就是中小地主和富农了。封建统治阶级从来就把自己冒充为全体人民的代表。现在陆雨先生居然也把地主阶级和广大劳动群众等量齐观起来，难道你不觉得这是一种完全违反科学的说法吗？
    即使歌颂海瑞的“前朝后代的人民”当中有一部分是被压迫被剥削的劳动人民，那也并不奇怪。几千年来，封建的道德观念和政治思想，一直支配着中国社会，它不可能不对一部分劳动人民发生影响。这部分劳动人民受到空洞骗人的诺言所诱惑，一时随声附和，对于那种最准确地反映着他们的经济状况和最能代表他们的真实利益的思想反倒难于理解、难于接受，这是有可能的。但是这并不等于说，他们之所以如此，是真正“出于维护地主阶级利益”。不，绝对不！农民群众的利益和地主阶级的利益水火不容。他们之所以也喊一声“海青天”，不过是由于他们在一定的历史条件下，认识还不清楚而已。
    不错，如陆雨先生所说，封建统治下的农民对当时的现实“寄于无限的幻想”。但是必须指出，这种幻想主要的还是封建统治阶级的政治家和思想家散播的。他们为维护本阶级的长治久安，不能不在群众面前制造种种假象，散播种种幻想，同时还不得不狡猾地求助于一部分还没有觉悟起来的群众的支持。而我们的吴晗先生、陆雨先生竟然如此羽于轻信，把封建统治阶级所散播的幻想加以宣扬。难道你们不觉得自己正是充当了封建地主阶级的卫道士吗？
    在研究阶级斗争的历史时，必须牢牢记住列宁所说的一段话。列宁说：“所有一切压迫阶级，为了维持自己的统治，都需要有两种社会职能：一种是刽子手的职能，另一种是牧师的职能。刽子手镇压被压迫者的反抗和暴动。牧师安慰被压迫者，给他们描绘一幅在保存阶级统治的条件下减少痛苦和牺牲的远景……，从而使他们忍受这种统治，使他们放弃革命行动，冲淡他们的革命热情，破坏他们的革命决心。”（《列宁全集》第二十一卷，第二○八页）就各种有关史料看来，海瑞这个“清官”，在更大程度上是执行了牧师的职能。认清刽子手的职能，并不难；识破牧师的虚伪面貌，就比较不容易。这就是一部分“前朝后代的人民”被“清官”所迷惑的原因，也就是“海瑞戏”在一部分人当中“经久不衰”的原因。不去识破海瑞的虚伪面貌，不去认清海瑞全部行动为维护地主阶级利益的本质，这就说不上是“历史主义的治学态度”。
