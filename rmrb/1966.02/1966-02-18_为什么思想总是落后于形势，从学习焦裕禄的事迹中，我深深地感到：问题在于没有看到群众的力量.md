    Having listened to the broadcast of Comrade Jiao Yulu's model deeds, my heart remained uneasy for a long time. His spirit of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, his noble quality of serving the people wholeheartedly, his fearless revolutionary spirit and realistic scientific attitude, and his working methods that adhered to the mass line will forever be our role models.

    The natural conditions in Jiuquan are much better than those in Lankao County. Here, although some natural disasters occur every year, situations like the wind and sand destroying 200,000 mu of wheat in Lankao County in one go, floods submerging more than 300,000 mu of crops, and alkali burning 100,000 mu of seedlings have not occurred. In recent years, although production has increased year by year, the overall appearance of the county has not undergone fundamental changes.

    Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, the gap is quite large. The most fundamental difference is that creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is not as good as Comrade Jiao Yulu. As soon as Comrade Jiao Yulu arrived in Lankao, he grasped the main contradiction of controlling wind and sand, waterlogging, and alkali, and transforming the natural environment throughout the county, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of grasping the main contradictions. In a very short period of time, the county underwent great changes. I have been in Jiuquan for so many years, and I often fail to grasp the main contradictions.

    Chairman Mao often taught us to look at problems from a two-sided perspective. In the face of such great difficulties in Lankao, Comrade Jiao Yulu did not lose heart, but saw many favorable factors, saw the bright side, and led the people of the county to wage a tenacious struggle against nature. I have not done enough in this regard. For example: I only see the side of myself working all day, and I do not see that I have a lack of revolutionary spirit and neglect transforming myself; I only see that production is getting better year by year, and I do not see that there is always someone better, and I am satisfied with the status quo, which restricts the development of production. Why is my thinking not as sharp as that of Comrade Jiao Yulu? Why can’t I always keep up with the development of the objective situation? Upon inspection, the main reason is that I do not see the wisdom and power of the masses. In revolution and construction, I do not strive to be the best, but am content to be in the middle. On some major key issues, I do not act promptly, do not work hard and practically. In the socialist emulation campaign of learning from, catching up with, helping, and surpassing, I only see that others have higher production, but I do not see the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of Jiuquan. In studying Chairman Mao's works, I always emphasize that my level is low, I am busy with work, and I have no time. These are, in essence, concrete manifestations of a lack of revolutionary spirit.

    I am determined to use Jiao Yulu's immortal deeds to spur myself on, serve the people wholeheartedly, strive to be a Jiuquan "Jiao Yulu," and completely change the face of Jiuquan. I will never give up until I achieve my goal. Secretary of the Jiuquan County Committee, Gansu, Chang Kun

### 为什么思想总是落后于形势，从学习焦裕禄的事迹中，我深深地感到：问题在于没有看到群众的力量

    为什么思想总是落后于形势，从学习焦裕禄的事迹中，我深深地感到：
    问题在于没有看到群众的力量
    听了焦裕禄同志模范事迹的广播，心里久久不能平静。他活学活用毛主席著作的精神，他全心全意为人民服务的高贵品质，他大无畏的革命气概和实事求是的科学态度，他坚持群众路线的工作方法，永远是我们的学习榜样。
    酒泉的自然条件要比兰考县好得多。这里，尽管每年都要发生一些自然灾害，但是，象兰考县风沙一下打毁二十万亩麦子、洪水淹没三十多万亩庄稼、盐碱烧死十万亩禾苗等情况是没有发生过的。最近几年，虽然产量年年增长，但是，综观全县，面貌还没有发生根本性的变化。
    同焦裕禄同志比，差距相当大。最根本的一条差距是活学活用毛泽东思想不如焦裕禄同志。焦裕禄同志一到兰考，就根据毛主席的抓主要矛盾的教导，紧紧抓住了在全县范围内治风沙、治内涝、治盐碱，改造自然面貌这个主要的矛盾，在很短时间里，使全县就发生了很大的变化。我到酒泉这么些年，还往往抓不住主要矛盾。
    毛主席经常教导我们，看问题要一分为二。在兰考那么大困难的面前，焦裕禄同志没有泄气，反而看到了许多有利因素，看到了光明的一面，领导全县人民，同大自然进行顽强的斗争。我在这方面做得很不够。比方说：只看到自己成天工作的一面，没有看清自己有革命精神不振，忽视改造自己的一面；只看到生产一年比一年好的一面，而看不到天外有天，自己满足现状，使生产发展受到限制的一面。我自己的思想为什么不如焦裕禄同志那样敏锐？为什么总是跟不上客观形势的发展呢？检查起来，主要是看不到群众的智慧和力量，在革命和建设中，不是力争上游，而是甘居中游。在一些重大关键问题上，不是闻风而动，雷厉风行，扎扎实实地做艰苦工作。在比学赶帮超社会主义竞赛中，只是看到别人的产量高，而看不到酒泉人民的革命干劲。在学习毛主席著作方面，总是强调水平低，工作忙，没有时间。这些，实质上是革命精神不振的具体表现。
    我决心用焦裕禄的不朽事迹来鞭策自己，全心全意为人民服务，争取当一个酒泉的“焦裕禄”，彻底改变酒泉的面貌。不达目的，决不罢休。甘肃酒泉县委书记　常昆
