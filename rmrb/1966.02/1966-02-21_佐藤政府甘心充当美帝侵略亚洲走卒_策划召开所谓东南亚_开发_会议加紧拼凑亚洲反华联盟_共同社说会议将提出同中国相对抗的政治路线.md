　　New China News Agency, Tokyo, 19th Dispatch: In coordination with the strategic plan of American imperialism to "contain" China and aggress against Asia, the Japanese Sato government is stepping up preparations to convene a so-called "Southeast Asian Ministerial Conference on Development," to assemble a new Asian anti-China alliance.
　　According to the announcement of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the countries and regions participating in this conference, in addition to Japan, include the Philippines, "Malaysia," South Vietnam (puppet regime), Thailand, Laos (Vientiane regime), and Singapore. The Japanese Foreign Ministry will soon send them invitations. The conference is scheduled to be held in Tokyo on April 6th and 7th.
　　Although the Japanese government has been touting that this conference has no "political color," the *Asahi Shimbun* revealed on the 14th that the Japanese Foreign Ministry intends to use this conference "as a stepping stone," so that it will "not be limited to discussing economic issues" but will develop into a "political conference centered on discussing the China issue." Kyodo News reported on the 16th that the conference would propose a "political line antagonistic to China, which advocates a tough anti-American line." It also said that the Liberal Democratic Party and the Foreign Ministry also advocated that Japan should take this opportunity to strive to establish an "Asian group with a clear political color, seeking unity against China."
　　Kyodo News also revealed that the Japanese Sato government is attempting to "enhance (Japan's) leadership role in the Asian region" and expand into Southeast Asian countries by convening the "Southeast Asian Ministerial Conference on Development."
　　This political conspiracy of the Japanese Sato government to assemble an anti-China alliance in Asia is being carried out under the instructions of the United States. Tokyo's *Mainichi Shimbun* reported on the 12th: "This plan is being promoted under the instructions of the United States. It is closely related to the US plan to establish a 'Southeast Asia Development Agency'."
　　According to the US Information Service, William Bundy, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, admitted in a speech in Pomona, California, on the 12th that US military aid to Japan, Thailand, and other countries and puppet regimes, and support for the "Asian Development Bank" and the "Mekong River Basin Project," "these efforts are all interconnected" to "contain" China. He also said that these "are a kind of implementation of (the containment of China) through completely unrestricted actions."
　　Some Japanese public opinion condemns the reactionary Japanese faction's death-wish-like pursuit of the American imperialist policy of aggression as willingly being buried with the United States. *Economics* magazine pointed out, "The Japanese Liberal Democratic Party government is accelerating down the path of increasingly turning Japan into an Asian orphan, committing suicide together with American imperialism."

　　佐藤政府甘心充当美帝侵略亚洲走卒
　　策划召开所谓东南亚“开发”会议加紧拼凑亚洲反华联盟
　　共同社说会议将提出同中国相对抗的政治路线
    新华社东京十九日电　配合着美帝国主义的“遏制”中国、侵略亚洲的战略计划，日本佐藤政府正在加紧筹备召开一个所谓“东南亚各国开发部长会议”，拼凑新的亚洲反华联盟。
    据日本外务省宣布参加这个会议的，除日本以外，还有菲律宾、“马来西亚”、南越（傀儡政权）、泰国、老挝（万象政权）、新加坡六个国家和地区。日本外务省即将向它们发出邀请书。会议定于今年四月六日、七日在东京举行。
    尽管日本政府一直鼓吹这次会议毫无“政治色彩”，但是《朝日新闻》在十四日透露，日本外务省准备把这个会议“做为一个跳板”，使它“不仅限于讨论经济问题”，而且要发展成为“以讨论中国问题为中心”的“政治会议”。共同社十六日报道说，这次会议将提出一个“同主张反美强硬路线的中国相对抗的政治路线”。它还说，自由民主党和外务省还主张日本应当借此机会，努力建立一个“政治色彩鲜明的、谋求团结反华的亚洲集团”。
    共同社还透露，日本佐藤政府企图通过召开“东南亚各国开发部长会议”，来“提高（日本）在亚洲地区内的领导作用”和向东南亚国家进行扩张。
    日本佐藤政府的这个拼凑亚洲反华联盟的政治阴谋是在美国的授意下进行的。东京《每日新闻》十二日报道说：“这一计划是在美国授意下推进的。它同美国建立‘东南亚开发机构’的计划有密切联系。”
    据美国新闻处报道，美国负责远东事务助理国务卿威廉·邦迪十二日在加利福尼亚州的波莫纳发表演说时承认，美国对日本、泰国等国家和傀儡政权的军事援助和对“亚洲开发银行”、“湄公河流域计划”的支持，“这些努力都是互相联系的”，是为了“遏制”中国。他还说，这些“是一种通过完全不受限制的行动来贯彻（对中国）的遏制”。
    日本一些舆论谴责日本反动派这种死心塌地地追随美帝国主义侵略政策的倒行逆施的做法是甘心为美国殉葬。《经济》杂志指出，“日本自由民主党政府正在加速走上把日本越来越变成亚洲孤儿、跟美帝国主义一同自杀的道路。”
