    Lush Green Sugarcane Grove
    Tang Yaozu

    Editor's Note: Chairman Mao called on us to serve the people of the world. With this in mind, Chinese experts working in Mali, together with the Malian people, have been experimenting with sugarcane cultivation. In their work, they have overcome both technical difficulties in planting and artificial difficulties created by certain colonialists. As a result, in just over two years, they have reclaimed sugarcane groves in areas once considered "unsuitable for sugarcane cultivation."

    However Long Needed, We Will Stay
    We accepted the entrustment of the people of our motherland to come and help the Republic of Mali develop sugarcane production.

    Tea and sugar are necessities for the Malian people, requiring large quantities to be imported from abroad each year. Western countries cruelly exploit the Malian people with exorbitant prices every year. After Mali's independence, the government, in order to break free from this exploitation, requested Western countries to send technical experts to Mali to experiment with sugarcane cultivation. Western countries sent an "expert" who established a "sugarcane experiment station" in Mali. After several years of operation, a few scattered sugarcane plants grew, but eventually they all withered and died. The "expert" then wrote a book stating that Mali was not suitable for sugarcane cultivation.

    When we first arrived in Bamako, a European expert, who claimed to be a West African "agricultural authority," said to us:
      "Growing sugarcane in Mali is fraught with difficulties; it will take no less than twenty years." Then, raising an eyebrow, he asked me, "How long are you prepared to stay in Mali?"

    I am already over sixty years old. Obviously, this expert wanted to use the long period of "twenty years" to frighten me, an old man.

    I immediately said: "However long the Malian people need us to stay, we will stay."

    After conducting surveys on the vast land of Mali, we encountered a difficult problem. Growing sugarcane, unlike other crops that rely on seeds for propagation, involves burying fresh sugarcane cut into sections in the soil. It would be unimaginable to transport these large quantities of seedlings from our motherland, 20,000 kilometers away. Importing them from Mali's neighboring countries would not only consume foreign exchange but also pose difficulties in transportation and storage. Just as we were extremely anxious, in an orchard in the middle of the Niger River, we saw a sugarcane field with more than two hundred and thirty sugarcane plants. These were propagated from sugarcane seedlings that the orchard manager had asked a merchant to bring back from the Ivory Coast three years ago. Due to the Malian friends' lack of planting experience, the sugarcane did not grow well. Facing this small sugarcane field, I was very excited. From here, we saw the Malian people's great enthusiasm for building their own country, and at the same time, the sugarcane seedlings we needed for our trial planting were also solved. We carefully cultivated this small sugarcane field.

    From "Monsieur" to "Comrade"
    When those two hundred or so sugarcane plants grew from weak to robust, we began our trial planting.

    According to our experience in growing sugarcane in Guangdong, the seedlings should sprout eight or nine days after being planted in the soil. However, ten days passed, and there was no sign of anything happening in the field. We became nervous. Twelve days later, we and the Malian workers dug out the sugarcane seedlings one by one for inspection and found that only two out of every hundred were sprouting, while the rest had all been drowned. Where did this water come from? After careful investigation, it turned out that there was a ditch not far from the sugarcane field. Although this ditch was usually dry, the water would seep into the sugarcane field whenever it was released. After understanding this situation, we replanted and dug a drainage ditch around the sugarcane field.

    Ten days later, 100% of the seedlings emerged from the soil. At this time, our feelings of excitement were indescribable. We were about to formulate a large-scale planting plan when we suffered another unexpected blow. White ants were found in the sugarcane field, and half of the seedlings were eaten by the white ants. At this time, we did not have suitable pesticides on hand, and the more serious problem was that the sugarcane planting season was about to pass, and necessary measures had to be taken.

    At this time, the Party Committee of the Embassy gave us strong support and encouragement. From the cordial conversations with the responsible comrades of the Party Committee, I felt that the Party was caring for us and the people of the motherland were caring for us. I had only one thought in my mind: we must overcome the difficulties by all means! I remembered Chairman Mao's instruction of "from the masses, to the masses" and, together with the translator, braved the scorching heat of over 40 degrees Celsius to visit the farmers' homes. An old farmer told us that their method of using irrigation to eliminate termites was very effective.

    We adopted the suggestions of the Malian farmers and irrigated the land before planting and dug a ditch around the sugarcane field.

    The fierce African sunlight is very beneficial to the growth of sugarcane. Not only does the sugarcane grow fast and have a short maturity period, but it also grows thick and strong, larger than the average sugarcane we saw in Guangdong.

    Here, I have to say a few words about the scenes of our joint labor with the Malian workers. I remember the first time I walked from my residence to the field, the Malian workers showed a look of surprise on their faces when they saw me take off my shoes and step into the mud like them. They did not prepare any labor tools for us. After my repeated requests, they found two short hoes for us. At the beginning, the Malian workers still called us "Monsieur," the same way they used to call the colonialist "experts." Not long after, the Malian workers stopped calling us "Monsieur." They affectionately called me "Comrade Tang."

    The Center of Conversation for the Malian People
    When lush green sugarcane groves were cultivated on the land of Mali, the Malian people had already achieved success in growing tea with the help of Chinese tea expert Lin Guitang. Sugarcane groves and tea gardens, tea and sugar, became the center of conversation for the Malian people. The imperialists' theory that "Mali cannot grow tea" and "Mali cannot grow sugarcane" was shattered in the face of facts. Tea and sugar became Mali's pride in Africa.

    People came to visit the sugarcane grove in an endless stream. President Keita and government officials came, and some leaders from other African countries also came. Even a delegation from the "European Common Market," which used to sell white sugar to Mali, came to visit. After quickly walking around the sugarcane grove, they were about to slip away when a Malian production director caught up with them and asked:
      "Gentlemen, please leave your comments."
    "Your sugarcane is growing very well," one of the delegation members said coldly. "But large-scale development still needs careful consideration."

    After the delegation left, the production director said to me happily: "Don't worry about them, let's do our own thing. They have ulterior motives; their business is about to fail!"

    One day, after a Western "expert" saw our sugarcane grove, he came to me and suddenly showed me a special kind of affection, saying:
      "You and we are both serving the Malian people. I suggest we cooperate, uh... cooperate?"
      "There is nothing to cooperate between us," I replied sternly.

    A few days later, I was sorting out some technical materials in my residence when Sissoko, the worker who looked after the garden, ran to me crying:
      "Comrade Tang, yesterday, I don't know whose sheep got into the sugarcane field and ate one hundred and several dozen sugarcane plants."
      "When did they eat them?"
      "After dark."

    This matter cannot but arouse our deep thought. There are no villages within two kilometers of the sugarcane grove, and the general public would not graze sheep near the sugarcane grove after dark. I asked Sissoko to investigate this matter carefully.

    Soon, Sissoko ran to me again and told me that the shepherd had been found. He had admitted his mistake, saying that it was not his intention to graze sheep near the sugarcane grove, but a foreigner had asked him to go.

    Hearing Sissoko's narration, I felt very indignant. I said to Sissoko: "Some people are unhappy about the development of sugarcane in Mali. We must be vigilant!"

    At this time, I saw a spark of anger in the eyes of this old worker. He said nothing, took a mat from his home, wore a long knife, and walked towards the sugarcane grove. I asked him what he was going to do. He said to me sternly:
      "From now on, I will live in the sugarcane grove every night!"

    A feeling of reverence surged in my heart. The era of black people being enslaved and trafficked is over. They are the masters of the African land!

    The Tree of Friendship Blossoms and Bears Fruit
    In the two and a half years of living in Mali, our motherland has been caring for us at all times and giving us strong support.

    Once, when a Chinese economic delegation visited Mali, I only generally mentioned that the sugarcane varieties here were not ideal and did not make any requests. Unexpectedly, after the comrades of the delegation returned to China, from the Ministry of Agriculture in Beijing to the Department of Agriculture in Guangdong Province, and all the way down to the farms and communes, many people were busy selecting excellent sugarcane seedlings for the Malian people.

    In June 1963, it was the season for planting sugarcane in Mali. The motherland sent someone specifically to transport sugarcane seedlings for the Malian people. Each sugarcane seedling of different varieties was sealed with plastic film, as fresh as the ones I saw in China. I hurriedly told the Malian friends this news. They were so moved that they grabbed my hand and said:
      "China, China's support for us is sincere."

    When I set off to return to my motherland, a production director who had been with me for more than two years handed me five mango tree seedlings.
      "Let the tree of friendship blossom and bear fruit on the land of great China!" he said enthusiastically, shaking my hand.

    Now, these mango trees have taken root and blossomed in our land of Guangdong. Whenever I see the lush green leaves of the mango trees, I feel as if I am back in the lush green sugarcane groves of Mali, working and fighting together with the Malian people.

    青青甘蔗林
    唐耀祖
    编者按　毛主席号召我们为世界人民服务，本着这种思想，我国在马里工作的专家和马里人民一起，试种甘蔗。在工作中，他们既战胜了种植技术上的困难，也战胜了某些殖民主义者人为的困难。结果只用两年多的时间，就在过去被认为“不能种植甘蔗”的地方，开垦出一片一片的甘蔗林来。
    需要多久呆多久
    我们接受祖国人民的委托，前来帮助马里共和国发展甘蔗生产。
    茶和糖，是马里人民的生活必需品，每年需要从国外大量进口。西方国家每年用高昂的价格对马里人民进行残酷的掠夺。马里独立后，政府为了摆脱这种掠夺，曾要求西方国家派技术专家来马里试种甘蔗。西方国家派了一个“专家”，在马里办了个“甘蔗试验场”。办了好几年，稀稀落落长出几棵甘蔗，最后也枯死了，于是这位“专家”就著书立说，说马里不适宜种甘蔗。
    我们刚到巴马科的时候，一位号称西非“农业权威”的欧洲专家对我们说：
      “在马里种甘蔗，困难重重，没有二十年的时间是不行的。”接着，眉毛一扬，问我：“你准备在马里呆多久？”
    我已经六十多岁了，显而易见，这位专家想用“二十年”这个漫长的时间来吓唬我这个老头子。
    我当即说：“马里人民需要我们呆多久，我们就呆多久。”
    我们在马里广阔的土地上进行踏勘以后，遇到了一个难题。种甘蔗不象其它庄稼那样靠种籽来繁殖，是把新鲜的甘蔗切成一节节埋在土里。这大量的种苗如果从二万公里外的祖国运来，简直是难以想象的；如果从马里的邻国进口，不仅要耗费外汇，在运输和保管上都有一定困难。正当我们万分焦急的时刻，在尼日尔河流中部的一个果木场里，我们看到一块甘蔗地，长着二百三十多棵甘蔗。这是三年前果木场场长托一位商人从象牙海岸带回的甘蔗种苗繁殖起来的。马里朋友由于缺乏种植的经验，甘蔗长得不好。我面对着这一小块甘蔗田，十分激动，从这里我们看到了马里人民建设自己祖国的巨大热情，同时我们试种甘蔗所需要的种苗，也得到了解决。我们精心地培育着这一小块甘蔗田。
    从“先生”到“同志”
    当那二百多棵甘蔗由瘦弱变得茁壮的时候，我们开始试种了。
    按照我们在广东种植甘蔗的经验，种苗下土后八九天就可以露芽，可是十天过去了，地里一点动静都没有。我们的心情紧张起来。十二天后，我们和马里工人把甘蔗种苗一根根挖出来检查，发现一百棵当中只有两棵正在发芽，其余全部都被淹死了。这是哪儿来的水呢？经过仔细的调查，原来离甘蔗地不远有一道水沟，这道水沟尽管平时是干涸的，但每逢放水时，水就渗透到甘蔗地里去了。了解了这些情况以后，我们就重新进行试种，并在甘蔗地的四周挖了一道排水沟。
    十天以后，种苗百分之百的出土了，这时候我们那种兴奋的心情是难以用言语形容的。我们正准备制定大规模的种植计划，不料又遭到一次意外的打击，甘蔗地里发现了白蚂蚁，有一半的种苗都被白蚂蚁啃坏了。这时，我们手头没有合适的农药，更严重的问题是：甘蔗的播种期快要过去了，必须采取必要的措施。
    这时候，使馆党委给了我们有力的支持和鼓励，从党委负责同志亲切的谈话中，我感觉到党在关怀我们，祖国的人民在关怀我们，我心里只有一个念头：一定要千方百计地战胜困难！我想起了毛主席“从群众中来，到群众中去”的指示，便和翻译冒着摄氏四十多度的炎热，深入到农民家里访问。一位老农告诉我们，他们采用灌水的办法消灭白蚁很有效。
    我们采纳了马里农民的建议，在种植以前先在地里灌上一遍水，又在甘蔗地周围挖了一道水沟。
    非洲猛烈的阳光对甘蔗的生长十分有利，不仅甘蔗生长得快，成熟期短，而且长得又粗又壮，比我们在广东看到的一般甘蔗都要大。
    这里，我得说几句我们和马里工人共同劳动的情景。我记得第一次从住所走向田间，马里工人看到我脱了鞋，和他们一样光着脚踩进泥土里的时候，脸上露出一种惊讶的神色。他们并没有给我们准备劳动工具，经过我再三要求，他们才给我们找了两把短锄。开始，马里工人还按照过去称呼殖民主义者“专家”一样，称我们“先生”，不久以后，马里的工人不再称我们“先生”了，他们亲切地叫我“唐同志”。
    马里人民谈话的中心
    当马里的国土上开垦出一片一片青翠的甘蔗林的时候，在我国茶叶专家林桂镗帮助下，马里人民种茶早已获得成功。甘蔗林和茶园，茶叶和糖，成了马里人民谈话的中心。帝国主义者所散布的“马里不能种茶”“马里不能种甘蔗”的理论在事实面前粉碎了，茶叶和糖，成为马里在非洲的骄傲。
    来到甘蔗林参观的人络绎不绝，凯塔总统和政府官员来了，非洲其他国家的一些领导人也来了。甚至连过去向马里出售白糖的“欧洲六国共同市场”的代表团也来参观。当他们很快地在甘蔗林里转了一圈以后，正打算溜走，马里的一位生产处长追上去问他们：
      “先生们，请留下意见。”
    “你们的甘蔗长得很好。”代表团中的一个冷冷地说，“不过大规模发展还得慎重考虑。”
    代表团走了以后，这位生产处长对我快活地说：“别管他们，我们干我们的。他们是别有用心的，买卖眼看就要吹啦！”
    有一天，一个西方国家“专家”看了我们的甘蔗林以后，跑来找我，他忽然对我表示一种特别的亲热，说道：
      “你们和我们都是为马里人民服务的，我建议我们合作，嗯……合作？”
      “我们和你们之间没有什么好合作的。”我严肃地回答。
    几天以后，我正在住所整理一些技术资料，看园子的工人西塞哭着跑来找我：
      “唐同志，昨天不知道谁的羊走进了甘蔗地，吃掉了一百几十棵甘蔗。”
      “什么时候吃的？”
      “天黑了以后。”
    这件事情不能不引起我们的深思，甘蔗林二公里以内是没有村庄的，一般的群众也不会在天黑以后去甘蔗林附近放羊。我请西塞好好调查一下这件事情。
    不久，西塞又跑来告诉我，放羊的人找到了，他已经承认了错误，他说并不是他要到甘蔗林附近去放羊，是一个外国人叫他去的。
    听到西塞的叙述，我感到十分愤慨，我对西塞说：“马里发展甘蔗，有些人是不高兴的，我们要提高警惕！”
    这时候，我看到这位老工人的眼睛里，射出一道愤怒的火光，他一言不发，从家里拿了一条草席，佩着一把长刀，往甘蔗林走去，我问他要干什么，他严肃地对我说：
      “以后每天晚上我都住在甘蔗林里！”
    我的心头涌起了一股崇敬的感情，黑人被奴役被贩卖的时代过去了，他们是非洲土地上的主人！
    友谊之树开花结果
    在马里生活的两年半时间里，祖国无时无刻不在关怀着我们，给我们有力的支援。
    有一回，我国的一个经济代表团到马里访问，我只是一般地谈起这里的甘蔗品种不够理想，并没有提出任何要求。不料，代表团的同志回国以后，从北京的农业部到广东省农业厅，一直到下面的农场、公社，许多人都在为马里人民挑选甘蔗优良种苗忙碌着。
    一九六三年六月，正是马里播种甘蔗的季节，祖国派了专人为马里人民运送甘蔗种苗来了。一根根不同品种的甘蔗种苗都用塑料薄膜密封着，和我在国内时见到的一样新鲜。我忙把这个消息告诉马里朋友，他们感动得抓住我的手说：
      “中国，中国对我们的支援是真诚的。”
    当我启程回祖国的时候，和我相处了两年多的一位生产处长交给我五棵芒果树苗。
      “让友谊之树在伟大中国的土地上开花结果！”他热情洋溢地握着我的手说。
    现在，这几棵芒果树已经在我们广东的土地上生根开花了，每当我看到芒果树碧绿的嫩叶，我仿佛又置身在马里青青的甘蔗林里，正在和马里人民一起劳动，一起斗争。
            （尤宜记录整理）

    在中国专家和马里工人的共同努力下，马里的甘蔗获得了丰收。
