    Develop National Culture to Counter Colonial Influence
    Tanzania Actively Promotes National Language
    Cultivating New Writers Who Write in Swahili Nationwide
    The Tanzanian government recently decided to take measures to restore and develop the national language – Swahili.
    According to Muhi, an official of the Tanzanian Ministry of Rural Development and National Culture and a promoter of Swahili, the Tanzanian government will arrange Swahili programs on the radio to encourage widespread reading of Swahili books.
    Cultural committees to promote Swahili will be established in villages, counties, and districts throughout Tanzania. The Tanzanian government will cultivate new writers who write in Swahili throughout the country, encourage the publication of works related to Tanzanian culture, and prioritize Swahili works. The government will also organize seminars for Swahili writers and launch a nationwide Swahili essay competition in rural areas and regions.
    Swahili, with its rich vocabulary and ease of expression, has a long history.
    People in East Africa, northern Mozambique, and parts of southern Sudan and eastern Congo (Kinshasa) use this language.
    Before Tanzania's independence, the colonial authorities prohibited the use of Swahili in schools, and the national language was not respected. Swahili is now a major course in schools. Members of Parliament have also begun to speak Swahili in the National Assembly. Newspapers are also published in Swahili.
    In Zanzibar, all public announcements are written in Swahili. Algeria Establishes National Publishing Company to Break French Companies' Monopoly on Publishing
    Algerian Minister of Information Bachir Boumaza recently announced in Algiers that Algeria has established a national publishing and distribution company.
    The Minister of Information said that the company will exclusively handle the import and export of various publications such as books and newspapers, as well as distribution throughout the country.
    Boumaza also revealed that Algeria's publishing and distribution business has so far been almost entirely monopolized by a French publishing company, "Hachette". He pointed out that this company aims to make money, thus hindering the development of Algeria's public education. Mauritania Develops National Education, Student Enrollment Increases Eighteenfold Compared to Pre-Independence, Girls Also Gain the Right to Attend School
    Mauritania's education has made significant achievements since independence. The total number of students has now reached 27,500, which is eighteen times the number of students before independence.
    Before independence, there were only four primary schools and one secondary school in the country, with a total of only 1,500 students. More than 400 new primary schools and eight secondary schools have now been built.
    Girls had no opportunity to go to school before independence, but now female students account for 25 percent of the student population.
    Currently, primary education is being developed in rural and pastoral areas, and almost all teachers are Mauritanian.
    During the colonial rule, only French could be used for teaching, but now Arabic and French are used for teaching. The curriculum has also been adjusted.
    In the past, all textbooks were written by the French, but now Mauritanians themselves publish their history textbooks. Geography textbooks written by Mauritanians themselves will also be published soon.
    In order to train teachers, a normal school was established in the capital Nouakchott in 1964, with more than 100 students. Ghana's Education Development
    Ghana's education has made great progress, with the number of students in schools across the country increasing from 200,900 in 1950 to the current 1,330,000.
    In the 1964-1965 academic year, Ghana already had three universities enrolling 3,480 students. However, in 1951, Ghana had only one institution of higher education with only 108 students.
    Now, many of the textbooks used in primary and secondary schools are written by Ghanaians themselves. Mali Nationalizes a French Cinema
    The Malian government nationalized a French cinema called "Soudan" at the end of last month. The nationalized cinema immediately screened a Malian color documentary about the Fourth Malian Youth Week and other films.
    The Malian government also announced that the cinema will now screen films from Mali and China, among other countries.

    East Pakistan Promotes Bengali Language
    Chowdhury, chairman of the Bengali Language Popularization Committee of Pakistan, said at a press conference held in Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan, that more than 45,000 technical and scientific terms have been translated from English into Bengali in order to use Bengali to study science and technology.
    He said that another goal of the committee is to promote Bengali in East Pakistan. In the past few years, four Bengali books, including two science books, have been published, and another twenty-one are being printed. The committee is also compiling four dictionaries.
    Bengali is the main language used by the people of East Pakistan. During the long period of British colonial rule, Bengali was not promoted, and all official work and school teaching were conducted in English. Later, the Pakistani government established this committee to promote this national language. (Attached picture)

    发展民族文化　对抗殖民影响
    坦桑尼亚积极推广民族语言
    在全国培养用斯瓦希利语写作的新作家
    坦桑尼亚政府最近决定采取措施来恢复和发展民族语言——斯瓦希利语。
    据坦桑尼亚乡村发展和国民文化部官员、斯瓦希利语的推广者穆希不久前宣布，坦桑尼亚政府将在电台编排有关斯瓦希利语的节目以便鼓励广泛阅读斯瓦希利语书籍。
    在坦桑尼亚全国各地的村、县和区将成立推广斯瓦希利语的文化委员会。坦桑尼亚政府将在全国各地培养用斯瓦希利语写作的新作家，鼓励出版有关坦桑尼亚文化的著作，并且优先照顾斯瓦希利语的作品。政府还将为斯瓦希利语作家组织讨论会，并在乡村和各地区发动全国规模的斯瓦希利语作文比赛。
    词汇丰富、易于表达的斯瓦希利语有着悠久的历史。
    在东非、莫三鼻给北部以及苏丹南部和刚果（利）东部的一些地方的人民都使用这种语言。
    在坦桑尼亚独立前，殖民当局禁止在学校里使用斯瓦希利语，民族语言得不到尊重。斯瓦希利语现在已经成为学校里的主要课程。议员在国民议会中也开始用斯瓦希利语讲话。报纸也用斯瓦希利文出版。
    在桑给巴尔，所有的公众通告全都是用斯瓦希利文写的。阿尔及利亚成立全国出版公司打破法国公司对出版事业的垄断
    阿尔及利亚新闻部长巴希尔·布马札最近在阿尔及尔宣布，阿尔及利亚成立了全国出版和发行公司。
    新闻部长说，这家公司将独家经营各种书籍、报纸等出版物的进出口、以及在全国发行的业务。
    布马札还透露，阿尔及利亚的出版发行事业到目前为止几乎全部由一家法国“阿歇特”出版公司所垄断。他指出，这家公司以赚钱为目的，因而妨碍了阿尔及利亚公共教育事业的发展。毛里塔尼亚发展民族教育事业学生增为独立前十八倍，女孩也获得上学权利
    毛里塔尼亚的教育事业在独立以后取得了重大成就。学生总人数现在已经达到二万七千五百人，为独立前学生人数的十八倍。
    独立前，全国只有四所小学和一所中学，学生一共只有一千五百人。现在已经新建了四百多所小学和八所中学。
    女孩子在独立以前根本没有上学的机会，而现在女学生占在校学生人数的百分之二十五。
    目前，正在农村和牧区发展小学教育，所有教师几乎都由毛里塔尼亚人担任。
    在殖民统治时期，只能用法语来教学，而现在用阿拉伯语和法语两种语言进行教学。课程的安排也作了调整。
    过去所有的教科书都是法国人编写的，现在毛里塔尼亚人自己出版了他们的历史教科书。由毛里塔尼亚人自己编写的地理教科书也即将出版。
    为了培养师资，一九六四年在首都努瓦克肖特建立了一所师范学校，学生有一百多人。加纳教育事业发展
    加纳教育事业取得巨大发展，全国在校学生已由一九五○年的二十万零九千人，增加到现在的一百三十三万人。
    在一九六四——一九六五学年中，加纳已有三所大学招收学生三千四百八十人。但是，在一九五一年，加纳只有一所高等学校，学生只有一百零八名。
    现在，中小学里所用的许多教科书都是由加纳人自己编写的。马里把一家法国电影院收归国有
    马里政府在上月底已把一家名叫“苏丹”的法国电影院收归国有。这家被收归国有的电影院随即放映了关于第四届马里青年周的马里彩色纪录片和其它影片。
    马里政府还宣布，这家电影院今后将放映马里和中国等国影片。

    东巴基斯坦推广孟加拉语文
    巴基斯坦孟加拉语文普及委员会主席乔杜里最近在东巴基斯坦首府达卡举行的记者招待会上说，已经有四万五千多个技术和科学名词从英文翻译成孟加拉文以便利用孟加拉文研究科学技术。
    他说，委员会的另外一个目标是在东巴基斯坦推广孟加拉文。在过去几年中，已经出版了包括两种科学书籍在内的四种孟加拉文书籍，另外还有二十一种正在印刷中。委员会还在编著四本字典。
    孟加拉文是东巴基斯坦人民使用的主要语文。在英国长期殖民统治期间，孟加拉文没有得到推广，一切机关工作和学校教学都是用英文的。之后，巴基斯坦政府设立了这个委员会来推广这一民族语文。（附图片）
