    The Oppressed People Unite, Take a Thorough Revolutionary Path, and Can Completely Defeat the Brutal Enemy of U.S. Imperialism
    No Matter What卑鄙 Tricks U.S. Imperialism Plays, No Matter How Long It Prolongs the War of Aggression Against Vietnam, It Will Inevitably Be Defeated in the End
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th – Nguyễn Hữu Thọ, Chairman of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, recently said that the experience of the South Vietnamese people's continuous victories in the resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation proves that the oppressed people and oppressed nations, as long as they unite and fight bravely, and take a revolutionary path, any form of war of aggression can be crushed.
    Chairman Nguyễn Hữu Thọ recently gave a written response to questions raised by Ide Junichiro, a Hanoi-based reporter for the Japanese newspaper *Akahata* (Red Flag). *Akahata* published the full text of this response on the 7th.
    In his reply, Chairman Nguyễn Hữu Thọ elaborated on the characteristics and political and military significance of the South Vietnamese people's resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and looked forward to the victorious prospects of this struggle.
    Chairman Nguyễn Hữu Thọ said that due to the victorious development of the people's anti-aggression war, a vast liberated area has been formed in South Vietnam. In various parts of the liberated area, a truly people's democratic society is being built. The revolutionary regime in the liberated area has adopted the organizational form of the People's Self-Government Committee. With such liberated areas, the South Vietnam National Liberation Front can gradually create the material basis for realizing its program, and at the same time, the South Vietnamese people can enhance their own potential and create conditions for winning the final victory in the long-term anti-U.S. struggle.
    Based on the practical experience of the South Vietnamese people and the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, Chairman Nguyễn Hữu Thọ elaborated on the four points of significance of the armed struggle for liberation by the oppressed people and oppressed nations: First, because colonialism and imperialism use counter-revolutionary violence to suppress their own people and enslave foreign people, the oppressed people must use their own revolutionary violence to resist and eliminate them. Only a thorough revolutionary path can truly liberate the masses of the people and truly defend peace. Second, in the life-and-death struggle with oppressors and aggressors, although the revolutionary people initially have no weapons, if they raise their awareness of just rights and their own powerful strength, and arouse strong hatred, then the revolutionary people will have weapons that cannot be destroyed by any of the enemy's excellent weapons. Third, in the struggle against oppression and aggression, if there is correct leadership; if the people unite and receive broad support from the world; constantly tap potential and enhance their own strength; at the same time, pay attention to discovering and deeply studying the enemy's weaknesses; guide the masses from small victories to great victories; repulse the enemy step by step, and defeat them one by one; then complete victory will definitely be achieved in the end. Fourth, even enemies as brutal and bloodthirsty as U.S. imperialism are not terrible, and they can be completely defeated. The oppressed people and oppressed nations, as long as they understand that they must stand up heroically and fearlessly, counterattack the enemy, improve the methods of counterattack, and develop their struggle into a war of the whole people and a comprehensive war, then all kinds of forms of aggression by the enemy can be crushed, and all kinds of forms of oppression by the enemy can be crushed.
    When talking about the prospects of the South Vietnamese people's struggle, Chairman Nguyễn Hữu Thọ said that no matter how frantically Johnson and McNamara and their ilk increase troops and expand the war to North Vietnam, they still cannot regain the initiative in the war. The South Vietnamese people and army can inflict devastating blows on the enemy in any season.
    Chairman Nguyễn Hữu Thọ said that after its defeats, U.S. imperialism uses the words "peace" and the trick of "unconditional negotiations" to deceive public opinion and cover up its crazy aggressive actions. However, the South Vietnamese people, together with the progressive people of the world, are fully vigilant about this. No matter what卑鄙 tricks U.S. imperialism plays, no matter how long it prolongs the war, it will inevitably be defeated in the end. The South Vietnamese people will not fear any sacrifice or hardship and will fight to the end in order to complete the glorious cause of liberating South Vietnam and unifying the motherland.
    Chairman Nguyễn Hữu Thọ also highly praised the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and expressed gratitude to the Japanese people for their support for the just struggle of the South Vietnamese people.

### 被压迫人民团结起来采取彻底革命的路线完全可以打败美帝国主义这样残暴的敌人

    阮友寿主席谈越南南方人民抗美救国斗争的胜利经验
    被压迫人民团结起来采取彻底革命的路线完全可以打败美帝国主义这样残暴的敌人
    不论美帝演出什么样卑鄙的把戏，不论它把侵越战争延长多久，最后必遭失败
    新华社东京十日电　越南南方民族解放阵线主席阮友寿最近说，越南南方人民抗美救国斗争不断取得胜利的经验证明，被压迫人民和被压迫民族，只要团结起来勇敢地进行斗争，并且采取革命的路线，任何形式的侵略战争都可以被粉碎。
    阮友寿主席最近对日本《赤旗报》驻河内记者井出润一郎提出的问题作了书面答复，《赤旗报》七日发表了这篇答复的全文。
    阮友寿主席在答复中，阐述了越南南方人民抗美救国斗争的特点及其政治、军事意义，展望了这一斗争的胜利前景。
    阮友寿主席说，由于人民反侵略战争的胜利发展，在越南南方已经形成了广大的解放区。在解放区各地，正在建设一个真正的人民民主的社会。解放区的革命政权采取了人民的自治管理委员会的组织形式。由于有了这样的解放区，越南南方民族解放阵线就可以逐步创造实现自己的纲领的物质基础，同时南越人民也可以增强自身的潜力，为争取长期的抗美斗争的最后胜利创造条件。
    阮友寿主席根据南越人民和越南南方民族解放阵线的实际经验，阐述了被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的武装斗争的四点意义：一、由于殖民主义和帝国主义用反革命的暴力来镇压本国人民和奴役外国人民，被压迫人民必然要用自己的革命暴力去反抗和消灭它们。只有彻底革命的路线，才能真正解放人民大众，真正保卫和平。二、在同压迫者和侵略者进行你死我活的斗争过程中，革命的人民虽然最初手中没有武器，但是，如果他们提高了对于正义权利和自身强大力量的觉悟，激发起强烈的仇恨，那么，革命人民手中就有了敌人的任何优良武器所破坏不了的武器。三、在反抗压迫和侵略的斗争中，如果有正确的领导；如果人民团结起来，并得到全世界的广泛支持；不断地挖掘潜力和增强自己的力量；同时，注意发现和深入研究敌人的弱点；引导群众从小胜利走向大胜利；将敌人一步步地击退，各个加以击破；那么最后一定能够得到完全胜利。四、即使象美帝国主义那样残暴和嗜血成性的敌人，也没有什么可怕的，它是完全可以打败的。被压迫人民和被压迫民族只要懂得，英勇无畏地站起来，给敌人以反击，改进反击的方法，把自己的战斗发展成全民的、全面的战争，那么，敌人的各种各样的侵略战争形式都可以被粉碎，敌人的各种各样的压迫形式都可以被粉碎。
    阮友寿主席在谈到对南越人民斗争的展望时说，不论约翰逊、麦克纳马拉之流如何疯狂地增兵和向越南北方扩大战争，他们仍然不能夺回战争的主动权。南越人民和军队能够在任何季节给敌人以毁灭性的打击。
    阮友寿主席说，美帝国主义在失败之后，就用“和平”的词句和“无条件谈判”的把戏来欺骗舆论，掩盖它疯狂的侵略行动。但是，南越人民和全世界进步人民一起，对此保持充分的警惕。不论美帝国主义演出什么样卑鄙的把戏，不论它把战争延长多久，最后它必然要遭到失败。南越人民为了完成解放越南南方和统一祖国的光荣事业，将不怕任何牺牲和艰难困苦而奋斗到底。
    阮友寿主席还高度赞扬日本人民为争取独立、民主、和平、中立而进行的斗争，并对日本人民对于越南南方人民的正义斗争所给予的支援表示感谢。
