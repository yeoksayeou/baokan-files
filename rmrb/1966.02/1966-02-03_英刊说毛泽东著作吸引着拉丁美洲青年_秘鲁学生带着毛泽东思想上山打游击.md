    Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd. An article in the British journal *The Economist* on January 29th revealed that young Latin American students enjoy reading Mao Zedong's works, and Peruvian university students are taking Mao Zedong Thought to the mountains to mobilize peasants to wage struggle.
    The journal's reporter, in a dispatch from Cusco, Peru, titled "Peruvian University Students Take Mao's (Zedong's) Thought to the Mountains," said, "Mao Zedong's words naturally find favor among Latin American university students." The article pointed out that Mao Zedong's works are easy to understand and do not require the same effort as reading Marxist theory. It is not necessary to spend a long time in the library figuring out the "mysteries" of guerrilla warfare, land issues, and social revolution. It said that Mao Zedong's works are more appealing to wavering young people.
    The article said that "many student leaders" in Peru "resolutely support Mao (Zedong)." In recent years, university students in Cusco have gone deep into the Andes Mountains to organize peasant associations, demanding the return of land seized by large estate owners. They talk to peasants in indigenous languages and have a considerable impact on them. They organize peasant associations to carry out land seizure struggles, which often lead to bloody conflicts between peasants and the police and frequent political crises.
    The article also said that students from Cusco University and Ayacucho University "played an important role" in the guerrilla warfare that broke out in June last year. It pointed out that progressive forces dominate among Peruvian university students.

    英刊说毛泽东著作吸引着拉丁美洲青年
    秘鲁学生带着毛泽东思想上山打游击
    新华社二日讯　英国《经济学家》周刊一月二十九日的一篇文章透露，拉丁美洲青年学生喜欢阅读毛泽东著作，秘鲁大学生带着毛泽东思想上山发动农民进行斗争。
    这家周刊的记者从秘鲁库斯科发回的这篇题为《秘鲁大学生带着毛（泽东）的思想上山》的报道说：“毛泽东的话在拉丁美洲大学生中自然受到喜爱”。文章指出，毛泽东著作通俗易懂，不需要象阅读马克思学说那样费劲。不需要长时间耽在图书馆里弄通关于游击战、土地问题和社会革命的“奥秘”。它说，毛泽东著作更吸引着徬徨中的青年。
    文章说，秘鲁的“许多大学生领导人是坚决支持毛（泽东）的”。库斯科的大学生近几年来深入安第斯山区组织农会，要求收回被大庄园主夺去的土地的权利。他们用印第安语同农民进行谈话，对农民产生相当大的影响。他们组织农会进行夺地斗争，这常常导致农民和警察之间的流血冲突和时常发生的政治危机。
    文章还说，库斯科大学和阿亚库乔大学的学生在去年六月份爆发的游击斗争中“起了重要作用”。它指出，秘鲁大学生中，进步力量占优势。
