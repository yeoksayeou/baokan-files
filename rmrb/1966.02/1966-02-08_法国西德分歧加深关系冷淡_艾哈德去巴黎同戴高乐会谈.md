    Franco-West German Differences Deepen, Relations Cool
    Erhard to Paris for Talks with De Gaulle
    (Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, February 6) West German Chancellor Erhard left for Paris on the evening of February 6th. He will hold two days of talks with French President De Gaulle. According to announcements here, the main topics of Erhard's talks with De Gaulle are: "political cooperation" in Western Europe, the German question, and the overall world political situation, including the situation in Vietnam.
    Since the West German general election last fall, the newly formed Erhard government has accelerated its pro-American policy while still trying to maintain "friendly" relations with France. However, in recent times, the fundamental differences between Bonn and Paris on a series of major issues have further deepened.
    West German newspapers recently admitted that Bonn's attitude of blindly following the United States on the Vietnam issue is diametrically opposed to Paris's sharp criticism of the U.S. policy in Vietnam; on the issue of the North Atlantic bloc, France strongly opposes the so-called "integration" organizational form, and the positions of the two sides are difficult to reconcile; and West Germany's demands for nuclear weapons have been repeatedly and resolutely opposed by France. On the issue of the "Common Market" of the six Western European countries, although newspapers publicized that the compromise reached at the recent meeting of the six foreign ministers in Luxembourg "improved" the conditions for this Paris meeting, and claimed that Erhard would therefore take the European issue, especially "political cooperation" in Western Europe, as the main topic of this meeting, Bonn officials admitted that no specific proposals in this regard could be expected from the talks. As for the German question, newspapers here believe that West Germany has "growing concerns" about whether France sincerely supports its territorial expansion and revanchist policies. Erhard may "seriously" discuss the German question with De Gaulle this time and inquire about the purpose of De Gaulle's planned visit to the Soviet Union in June. At the same time, West German officials have recently repeatedly expressed their hope that France will support West Germany on the German question.
    In view of the current very cool relationship between Bonn and Paris, West German newspapers generally believe that no major results can be expected from this meeting.

### 法国西德分歧加深关系冷淡  艾哈德去巴黎同戴高乐会谈

    法国西德分歧加深关系冷淡
    艾哈德去巴黎同戴高乐会谈
    据新华社波恩六日电　西德总理艾哈德六日晚上动身去巴黎。他将同法国总统戴高乐举行两天会谈。据这里宣布，艾哈德这次同戴高乐会谈的主要题目有：西欧的“政治合作”，德国问题以及整个世界政治局势、包括越南局势等。
    从去年秋天西德大选以后，新组成的艾哈德政府一面加紧推行亲美政策，一面仍然力图维持同法国的“友好”关系。但是，近一个时期以来，波恩和巴黎在一系列重大问题上的根本分歧进一步加深了。
    西德报刊最近承认：在越南问题上波恩一味追随美国的态度恰恰同巴黎尖锐批评美国的越南政策背道而驰；在北大西洋集团问题上，法国极力反对所谓的“一体化”组织形式，双方立场难以接近；而西德在核武器方面的要求更一再遭到法国的坚决反对。在西欧六国
  “共同市场”问题上，尽管报刊宣传不久前在卢森堡六国外长会议上取得的妥协使这次巴黎会谈的条件得到了“改善”，并且声称艾哈德因此要把欧洲问题、特别是西欧的“政治合作”作为这次会谈的主要题目。但是波恩官方承认，不能期望会谈中在这方面提出什么具体建议。至于德国问题，这里的报刊认为，西德对法国是否认真支持其领土扩张和复仇主义政策，怀着“日益增长的忧虑”。艾哈德这次可能“认真地”同戴高乐谈一谈德国问题，并且探听戴高乐预定今年六月访问苏联的目的。同时，西德官方人士最近一再表示，希望法国在德国问题上支持西德。
    鉴于波恩、巴黎间目前这种十分冷淡的关系，西德报纸普遍认为，不能期待这次会谈有重要结果。
