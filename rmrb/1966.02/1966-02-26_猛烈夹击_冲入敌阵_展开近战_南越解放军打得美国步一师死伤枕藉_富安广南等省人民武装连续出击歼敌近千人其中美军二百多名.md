　　Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 24th—The South Vietnam Liberation Army fiercely attacked the invading troops of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division and Australian mercenary troops near Xinping, north of Saigon, on the 24th. The Associated Press reported on the battle on the 24th, stating that this was "the heaviest attack the First Infantry Division has ever suffered in the Vietnam War" and "one of the heaviest blows the U.S. military has received in the Vietnam War."
    According to Western news agencies, before dawn on the 24th, under the cover of heavy fire, the Liberation Army suddenly launched a fierce pincer attack on the U.S. and Australian troops who were "sweeping" the Xinping area. The enemy troops, who were encamped at the time, were caught completely off guard and thrown into disarray. The resourceful and courageous Liberation Army took advantage of the enemy's confusion to charge into their defensive perimeter and engage in close combat. Bullets from Liberation Army soldiers rained down on the enemy, and hand grenades exploded continuously in the enemy's positions, with the enemy suffering heavy casualties. After more than three hours of fierce fighting, the Liberation Army inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy and then successfully withdrew.
    Since the 21st, several thousand invading troops of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division and 25th Infantry Division, who had already suffered heavy blows from the Liberation Army, along with Australian and New Zealand mercenary troops, have launched a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas north and northwest of Saigon. In recent days, they have only encountered sniper fire and landmine explosions from the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, without finding a single trace of the Liberation Army. On the 24th, the Liberation Army seized a favorable time and place to deal these invading bandits a heavy blow.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 24th—According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces and guerrillas in Phu Yen, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Rach Gia, Soc Trang, Bien Hoa, and other provinces in South Vietnam have recently launched successive attacks, killing and wounding nearly five hundred enemies, including one hundred and thirty U.S. invading troops.
    On February 8th, the Phu Yen Province Liberation Armed Forces fiercely intercepted enemy troops "sweeping" Sui Hoa County. According to preliminary reports, the Liberation Armed Forces killed and wounded one hundred and forty enemies in the anti-"sweep" battles in Hoa Sheng and Hoa Mei Townships, including one hundred and twenty U.S. invading troops.
    On February 6th, the Quang Nam Province Liberation Armed Forces attacked enemy troops stationed in Zuo Zhao and Jin Lu villages in Sheng Ping County, completely annihilating a company of puppet People's Self-Defense Forces and an engineering squad, killing seventy-five enemy soldiers and capturing fifteen (including a puppet deputy company commander).
    On the morning of February 8th, guerrillas in Tay Ninh Province intercepted a group of enemy troops attempting to relieve the Ren You stronghold in Li Shun Township, Bianqiu County. In just thirty minutes of fighting, they completely annihilated a company of puppet security forces, totaling more than one hundred soldiers, and seized all their weapons and military supplies.
    On the night of February 16th, the Rach Gia Province Liberation Armed Forces attacked a battalion of enemy troops that had just arrived in Dinh An Township, O Gao County, to protect Provincial Highway 12. According to preliminary reports, nearly one hundred enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and a large number of weapons and military supplies were seized.
    On the night of February 17th and the early morning of the 18th, the Soc Trang Province Liberation Armed Forces attacked and destroyed the enemy's Nan Gang stronghold in Xing Hui Township, Yongli County, killing and wounding fifty-two enemy soldiers and seizing all their weapons. Prior to this, the province's guerrillas also removed the enemy stronghold in Ai Fu La Township, liberating more than two hundred households in the township.
    In Bien Hoa Province, guerrillas in Xin Yuan County attacked a sentry post guarding the U.S. military base in Fucheng City on February 4th, killing and wounding seven U.S. invading troops. Prior to this, guerrillas also infiltrated Fucheng City and used hand grenades to kill the deputy director of the Fucheng City puppet police bureau.
    Guerrillas in Binh Dinh Province recently intercepted enemy convoys in the Fu Ji area, killing three U.S. soldiers, destroying two enemy vehicles, and shooting down four enemy helicopters.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi—According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the military and civilians in Bien Hoa and Can Tho provinces in South Vietnam successively thwarted two major "sweeps" by the U.S. and puppet troops in late January and early February, killing and wounding more than two hundred and thirty enemies and shooting down three U.S. helicopters.
    The report stated that the Bien Hoa Province Liberation Armed Forces continuously and valiantly intercepted three thousand U.S. invading troops "sweeping" the Ping Shan, Fu Tai, and other areas for four days from February 9th to 12th, killing eighty-three enemies, wounding many others, and shooting down three U.S. helicopters.
    From January 28th to 30th, guerrillas in Long My County, Can Tho Province, continuously intercepted more than one thousand puppet troops launching an offensive. After three days of fighting, the guerrillas crushed the puppet troops' offensive, killing and wounding more than one hundred and fifty enemies.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi—According to a supplementary report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Quang Ngai Province Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam completely annihilated two companies of security troops, commandoes, and two platoons of People's Self-Defense Forces in an attack on the enemy in Cha Fu Township, Cha Peng County, on January 28th, killing, wounding, and capturing two hundred and twenty-four enemy soldiers.

　　南越解放军打得美国步一师死伤枕藉
　　富安广南等省人民武装连续出击歼敌近千人其中美军二百多名
    新华社二十四日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放军二十四日在西贡以北新平附近痛击美国第一步兵师侵略军和澳大利亚帮凶军。美联社二十四日在报道这次战斗的消息中说，这是第一步兵师“在越南战争中从未遭受过的最沉重的袭击”，是“美军在越南战争中受到的最沉重的打击之一”。
    据西方通讯社报道，二十四日黎明前，解放军在强大火力的掩护下，突然分两路向正在新平一带“扫荡”的美澳军进行猛烈夹击。当时正在宿营的敌军吓得蒙头转向，乱成一团。机智英勇的解放军趁敌人混乱时冲进敌人防御圈内，同敌人展开近战。解放军战士的枪弹象雨点一样射向敌人，手榴弹不断在敌军阵地里开花，敌人纷纷中弹，死伤枕藉。经过三个多小时的激战，解放军在大量杀伤敌人后，胜利转移。
    二十一日以来，已经受到过解放军沉重打击的美国第一步兵师和第二十五步兵师的数千名侵略军，伙同澳大利亚和新西兰帮凶军，又向西贡以北和西北的解放区大举进犯。连日来，他们除了不断遭到越南南方解放武装力量狙击手的射击和地雷爆炸外，没有找到解放军的一个影子。而在二十四日，解放军抓住了有利的时间和地点，给这些侵略强盗们一次沉重的打击。
    新华社河内二十四日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方富安、广南、西宁、迪石、朔庄、边和等省解放武装力量和游击队，最近连续出击，共打死打伤敌人近五百名，其中有一百三十名美国侵略军。

    西宁省游击队二月八日早晨阻击了一支妄图为边求县利顺乡仍油据点解围的敌军，仅仅三十分钟的战斗，就全歼伪保安军一个连，共一百多名，缴获全部武器和军用物资。
    二月十六日夜晚，迪石省解放武装力量袭击了刚刚到达鹅高县定安乡去保卫十二号省际公路的一营敌军。据初步消息，共打死打伤敌人近百名，缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    二月十七日夜晚和十八日凌晨，朔庄省解放武装力量进攻并摧毁了敌人位于永利县兴会乡的南冈据点，打死打伤敌人五十二名，缴获全部武器。在这之前，这个省游击队还拔除了埃弗拉乡的敌军据点，使这个乡的二百多户人民获得解放。
    在边和省，新渊县游击队在二月四日袭击了保卫福成市美军基地的一个哨所，打死打伤美国侵略军七名。在这之前，游击队还潜入福成市，用手榴弹炸死福成市伪警察局副局长。
    平定省游击队最近在符吉地区截击敌军车队，打死美军三名，摧毁敌军车二辆，打落敌直升飞机四架。
