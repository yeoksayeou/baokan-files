    Class Friendship is Deeper Than the Sea
    The people of Daqing come from all corners of the country, united by a common revolutionary goal. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of Daqing are united in friendship, as close as brothers and sisters, not only the workers but also their families. The sunshine of socialist morality shines upon the people of Daqing. Daqing is a microcosm of the warm, great family of the motherland.
    
    It Was the Entire Class That Raised Them
    Deputy Driller Fan Yun
    
    Hu Yulan, the wife of Li Zixin, a mechanical technician in my team, suddenly fell ill. When this was known to all the families in the team, they immediately took turns serving the patient and taking care of the children. He Ling'e, the wife of instructor Yang Chunwen, cooked and fetched water for the patient and took care of household chores. Lu Xiuying, the wife of cook squad leader Du Haijiang, washed clothes and diapers for the children. Li Youying, the wife of Captain Wang Tianqi, arrived a little late. Seeing that others had taken over, she simply took the patient's two children to her own home to care for them. The one-year-old child cried incessantly because he wasn't getting enough food. She put her own child aside and fed Hu Yulan's child with her own milk. Yao Yuzhen, the wife of fifth-grade driller Dou Zhaofa, had two children of her own, but she asked Li Youying to let her take care of Hu Yulan's three-year-old child. After taking him, she bought cloth to make shoes for the child, made cotton pants, and even saved her own rationed fine grains to make noodles to feed the child. Those family members who didn't get to take a child took turns feeding the children milk, washing diapers, and bringing food and water to the patient.
    
    The unfortunate news came that Hu Yulan had died in the hospital. The families all expressed their willingness to raise the two children who had lost their mother. When the headquarters came to pick up the two children, no one was willing to hand them over. It was not until female worker cadre Zhang Jiajian gave everyone a detailed explanation: "The leadership has decided to send the children to the nursery, also to allow everyone to free up more time and energy to engage in agricultural and sideline production." Only then did everyone hand over the children to Zhang Jiajian. But before leaving, the family members repeatedly told her: "The child is young and just weaned. Don't feed too much at a time to prevent upsetting the child's stomach..."
    
    Afterwards, Li Yun, the then Party Secretary of the drilling well committee, wrote a letter to Comrade Li Zixin: "Comrade Li Zixin: Please remember this matter. When the two children grow up, tell them that it is our entire class that raised them into adulthood. Tell them to always remember to listen to the Party and follow the Party at all times."

    阶级友情深似海
    大庆人来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。大庆人在毛泽东思想的教导下，团结友爱，亲如手足，不仅职工是如此，连家属之间也如此。社会主义风尚的阳光照耀着大庆人，大庆，是温暖的祖国大家庭的一个缩影。
    养育她们的是整个阶级
    副司钻　范云
    我队机械技术员李自新的爱人胡玉兰突然病倒了。这件事被全队的家属知道后，她们立刻轮流着侍候病人、照顾孩子。指导员杨春文的爱人何玲娥给病人做饭、端水、料理家务；炊事班长杜海江的爱人卢秀英给孩子洗衣、洗尿布。队长王天其的爱人李友英来晚了一步，一看事情被别人包了，干脆把病人的两个孩子抱到自己家里去照顾。刚满一岁的孩子喂饭喂不饱，哇哇直哭，她把自己的孩子放在一边，用奶来喂胡玉兰的孩子。五级钻工窦找发的爱人姚玉珍，自己有两个孩子，可她让李友英把胡玉兰那个三岁的孩子让给她照顾。领去后，她就给孩子买布做鞋啦，做棉裤啦，还节省下自己吃的细粮做成面条喂孩子。那些没有抱到孩子的家属，就轮流给孩子喂奶、洗尿布，给病人送饭、端水。
    不幸的消息传来了，胡玉兰在医院里病故了。家属们都表示要把两个失去了妈妈的孩子抚养大。当指挥部来接两个孩子的时候，谁都舍不得把孩子交出来。直到女工干部张家健向大家作了详细的解释：“领导上决定把孩子送入托儿所，也是为了让大伙能腾出更多的时间和精力去搞农副业生产。”这时，大家才把孩子交给了张家健。可是在临走时，家属们还再三嘱咐：“孩子小，刚断奶，喂的时候别喂多了，防止吃坏孩子的肚子……”
    事后，当时的钻井党委书记李云，给李自新同志写了一封信：“李自新同志：请你把这件事情记住。等两个孩子长大了，告诉她们，养育她们长大成人的，是我们整个的阶级。叫她们永远记住，任何时候都要听党的话，跟着党走。”
