    I Serve the People Very Incompletely and Very Insufficiently
    My Own Practice Proves: Recognizing a Problem Does Not Equal Solving It; Truly Solving a Problem Requires a Sharp Struggle
    
    In studying Chairman Mao's works, I often told cadres and staff that you must study "Serve the People" well. Only by studying this article well can you clarify your direction, strengthen your stance, and establish a revolutionary worldview. However, I myself neglected this article. I thought, I'm running around all day long, sometimes without time to eat or sleep. If that's not serving the people, am I really being half-hearted?

    The People's Daily published the newsletter "The Example of a County Party Secretary – Jiao Yulu" and related editorials on February 7th. I read it two or three times in one go. The towering image of Comrade Jiao Yulu appeared before my eyes. His completely and thoroughly serving the people's revolutionary spirit struck deep into my heart. Comrade Jiao Yulu, carrying Chairman Mao's works and cherishing revolutionary ambitions, made significant contributions to the people of Lankao County in a short period of time. And I, as the county magistrate and acting county party secretary for three consecutive terms, what have I contributed to the people of Wu'an? Wu'an's conditions are better than Lankao's, so why haven't there been greater changes? I opened the article "Serve the People" and, according to Chairman Mao's teachings and Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds, and compared it with my own reality, I realized that my thinking on serving the people is still very incomplete and very insufficient.

    Two "Pictures"

    Comrade Jiao Yulu had a picture in his mind, and I also had a picture in my mind. But because of the different subjective worlds, the pictures painted in our minds are also completely different. Comrade Jiao Yulu's picture is: plant trees on sand dunes to prevent wind and sand, plant reeds in waterlogged depressions to raise fish, turn alkaline land into green fields, and the people cheer for the Communist Party. This is a beautiful picture designed entirely for the benefit of the people and for the revolutionary cause. Last spring, during the campaign to learn from Zunhua, I painted a picture in my mind like this: work hard for a year, strive to catch up with Zunhua, and after the autumn harvest, participate in the provincial labor model conference and return to Wu'an in glory, with a grand celebration on Nanguan Street. Where is this designed for the benefit of the people? It can be seen that whether or not you serve the people completely and thoroughly, these two pictures provide a sharp contrast.

    Two Kinds of Mental State

    In the past, I often told comrades that whether or not we can do a good job in the production revolution depends most on the mental state of the county party committee leadership. During the severe drought last year, I said that communists should rejoice in the joys of the people and worry about the worries of the people. Comrades wanted me to go to the theater and the movies. I said that with a severe drought upon us, we must think of the masses, and I have no mood to watch plays. At the time, I thought this was revolutionary. But when I compare myself with Comrade Jiao Yulu in this mirror, I can see clearly that I am very inadequate. The few words that Comrade Jiao Yulu added to his report to the prefectural committee fully demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. He not only said this, but also did it, fulfilling his vows with a fearless revolutionary spirit. And what about me? Although I led the masses in actively carrying out the fight against drought last year, I also had many distractions. I thought that a large number of strong cadres had gone to participate in the socialist education movement, and then we happened to encounter this year. There was a mental state of being fearful and unwilling to make revolution in the fight against drought. Why? Because the word "I" is still in my mind. If, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, we think wholeheartedly about the revolution and about the people, then we dare to break through mountains of knives and jump into seas of fire, what is there to fear, what is there to be afraid of!

    Two Different Work Styles

    Comrade Jiao Yulu's staying at a point was at the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, and his running around was to go to the masses. Therefore, he investigated and studied all the various situations in the county clearly, kept the opinions of the masses in his mind, and vigorously promoted the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, promoting the in-depth development of the three major revolutions throughout the county. Last spring, I ran around a lot, but stayed at points less often. I could drive two or three hundred li a day in a car. What was the result of running around? I only saw some superficial phenomena. Later, the leadership emphasized staying at points and asked for specific information on staying at points, so I stopped running around. Comrades suggested that I go to the "surface" to take a look, and I said that running around doesn't count as "work points." The masses asked me to go there to take a look, and I said that our county has more than five hundred villages, and even if I look at one a day, I can't finish in a year. In short, running around on the road, staying at points without an example, without relying on the masses, and without mobilizing the masses, the work is generalized.

    Why can't Wu'an's appearance be changed as quickly as possible? The problem is very obvious: the county party committee leadership (especially me) lacks the idea of serving the people completely and thoroughly, and lacks the revolutionary spirit of fighting against nature with class feelings. In the final analysis, it is the lack of serious effort in "applying" what we have learned from studying Chairman Mao's works. Practice further proves that recognizing a problem does not equal solving it, and truly solving a problem requires a sharp struggle. Now, our county party committee comrades have all seriously studied Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit and unanimously expressed that they want to be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, study Chairman Mao's works, and be good students of Comrade Mao Zedong; to be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, establish the idea of serving the people completely and thoroughly and the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat; to be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and follow the mass line well. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, taking Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, we will lead the people of the whole county, vigorously carry out the fight against drought, and change the face of Wu'an as quickly and thoroughly as possible.

### 我为人民服务很不完全很不彻底  自己的实践证明：认识了的问题，并不等于解决；真正解决问题，还必须有一个尖锐的斗争过程

    我为人民服务很不完全很不彻底
    自己的实践证明：认识了的问题，并不等于解决；真正解决问题，还必须有一个尖锐的斗争过程
    在学习毛主席著作中，我常对干部和工作人员说，你们要很好地学习《为人民服务》，只有学好这一篇，才能方向明确，立场坚定，树立革命的世界观。可是我自己却忽视了这一篇。我想，我成天东奔西跑，有时饭顾不得吃，觉顾不得睡，要说为人民服务，难道我还有三心二意吗？
    人民日报二月七日登载了《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》的通讯和有关社论，我一口气读了两三遍，焦裕禄同志的高大形象展现在我的眼前，他完全彻底地为人民服务的革命精神，打痛了我的心灵深处。焦裕禄同志带着毛主席著作，胸怀革命大志，在不长的时间里，为兰考县人民作出了重大贡献。而我是连续三任的县长、县委代理书记，为武安人民贡献了什么？武安的条件比兰考好，为什么变化不大？我打开《为人民服务》这篇文章，按照毛泽东同志的教导和焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹，与自己的实际一对比，我认识到，我为人民服务的思想还很不完全，很不彻底。
    两幅“图景”
    焦裕禄同志的脑子里装着一幅图景，我的脑子里也装过一幅图景。但由于主观世界不同，脑子里绘画出的图景也截然不同。焦裕禄同志的图景是：沙丘栽树风沙防，涝洼植苇养鱼塘，碱地白变青纱帐，人民欢呼共产党。这是完全为人民利益、为革命事业而设想的美丽图景。在去年春季学遵化的活动中，我脑子里绘画过这样一幅图景：大干一年，力争赶上遵化，秋后参加省劳动模范大会，光荣返武安，南关大街大贺大庆一番。这那里是为人民利益而设想呢。由此可见，是否完全彻底地为人民服务，这两幅图景作了鲜明的对照。
    两种精神状态
    过去我也常向同志们讲，我们能否把生产革命搞好，县委领导的精神状态最重要。在去年大旱的情况下，我说，共产党员要以人民之乐而乐，要以人民之忧而忧。同志们要我去看戏、看电影。我说，大旱临头，要想到群众，那有心思看戏。当时以为这样就算革命化了。但是拿焦裕禄同志这面镜子一对照，就看得一清二白，我很不够。焦裕禄同志在向地委报告中加的几句话，充分表现出无产阶级的革命精神状态。他不但这样说，而且也照这样做了，以大无畏的革命精神，实现了自己的誓言。而我呢？在去年大旱中，虽然领导群众积极进行抗旱斗争，但同时也有不少杂念。我想到大批的坚强干部参加社会主义教育运动去了，偏偏又遇上了这个年头。对抗旱斗争存在着大有可畏、不敢革命的精神状态。为什么呢？因为脑子里还有“我”字。如果象焦裕禄同志那样，全心全意想着革命，想着人民，那就刀山敢闯，火海敢跳，还有什么可畏，还有什么可怕！
    两样工作作风
    焦裕禄同志蹲点，是蹲在贫下中农家，跑面是跑到群众中去。因而，他把全县的各种情况都调查研究得清清楚楚，把群众的意见装在脑子里，把广大贫下中农的革命精神大张旗鼓地传播开，促进了全县三大革命的深入开展。我在去年春季，跑面多，蹲点少，坐上汽车一天能跑二、三百里。到底跑了个什么结果，只看到一些表面现象。后来，领导强调要蹲点，并要蹲点的具体情况，我就不跑面了。同志们建议我到“面”上去看看，我说，跑面不记“工”。群众要求我到那里去看看，我说，咱县五百多座村庄，一天看一个，一年也看不完。总之，跑面跑在路上，蹲点没有榜样，没有依靠群众，发动群众，工作一般化。
    为什么武安面貌不能尽快改变，问题很明显，是县委领导（尤其是我）缺乏完全、彻底地为人民服务的思想，缺乏带着阶级感情向大自然作斗争的革命精神。归根结底，是学习毛主席著作缺乏在“用”字上狠下功夫。实践进一步证明，认识了的问题，并不等于解决，真正解决问题，还必须有个尖锐的斗争过程。现在，我们的县委同志，都认真学习了焦裕禄同志的革命精神，一致表示：要象焦裕禄同志那样，学习毛主席著作，当毛泽东同志的好学生；要象焦裕禄同志那样，树立完全、彻底地为人民服务的思想和无产阶级的革命精神；要象焦裕禄同志那样，坚定地依靠贫下中农，走好群众路线。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，以焦裕禄同志为榜样，领导全县人民，大搞抗旱斗争，尽快地彻底地改变武安面貌。
