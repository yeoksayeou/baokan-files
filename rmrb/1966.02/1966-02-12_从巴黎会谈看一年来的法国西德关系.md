    From the Paris Talks to View the Franco-West German Relations of the Past Year

    The contradictions between France and West Germany have developed over the past year. Although their relationship will not develop into rupture and confrontation in a considerable period due to the need for mutual utilization, the factors of mutual contention for hegemony are now greater than the factors of unity.

    The semi-annual meeting between the French and West German heads of state ended on the 8th. Although there were no fierce quarrels at the meeting, apart from an empty promise on "political cooperation" in Western Europe and some discussions on scientific and technological cooperation, the differences between the two sides on a series of major issues remained the same.

    The deterioration of Franco-West German relations is an important aspect of the complex contradictions among Western countries in the past year. The key issue is that the two sides are pursuing two fundamentally different lines in their relationship with the United States. In this regard, the divergence between the two sides gradually became apparent shortly after Erhard came to power. Now, as Erhard becomes more and more pro-American, France and West Germany are drifting further and further apart. At the Rambouillet meeting in January 1965, the Erhard government once made a gesture of leaning slightly towards France in order to get rid of its isolation at the time. But it was only a flash in the pan, and events quickly proved that this was only a gesture after all. Under the wooing and instigation of the United States, the Erhard government's ambition to act as the United States' number one "close partner" became increasingly clear. Paris found that after the West German elections, the Erhard government's pro-American policy became more and more fixed. Although Erhard is unwilling to make a public and decisive choice between the United States and France, his actions of following the United States everywhere are bound to seriously affect relations with France and make the contradictions between them on a series of issues more complex and acute.

    The issue of West German nuclear armament is a major contradiction between them. West Germany's increasingly blatant desire to rely on the United States to get involved in nuclear weapons has aroused great suspicion on the French side. *Le Figaro* wrote in an article that a few years ago, the Gaullists did not rule out the possibility of France allowing West Germany to participate in the planned "European nuclear strike force." "At present, France has adopted a clear attitude. It is not only opposed to the multilateral nuclear force, but also opposed to Germany's participation in the Atlantic Alliance nuclear strategy in any form." At the end of 1964, the two sides had a major confrontation on the issue of multilateral nuclear forces. At the end of 1965, the United States attempted to give West Germany a say in nuclear strategy by establishing a special committee on nuclear issues of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. France holds a firm opposition to this. Both sides knew that the contradictions on this issue were difficult to reconcile, so they did not discuss this issue at all in this meeting.

    On the issue of establishing a "small Europe," West Germany advocates establishing an "Atlantic Europe" led by the United States and dominated by West Germany, while France advocates establishing a "Europe of Europeans" that confronts the United States. Since the two sides are running in opposite directions in political goals, some economic contradictions have become more difficult to resolve. Although the unprecedentedly serious and prolonged crisis of the "Common Market" of the six Western European countries in 1965 broke out on economic issues, it was also a reflection of political contradictions.

    In this situation, in the view of the French government, West Germany is no longer a fellow traveler with France in achieving the strategic goal of establishing a "Europe of Europeans," but has become a rival to France, supported by the United States, in the struggle for hegemony in Western Europe. In the eyes of the West German Erhard government, the role that France can be used to raise its international status is also gradually decreasing. On the contrary, its role in hindering the realization of West Germany's ambitions is gradually increasing. In this regard, French newspapers have recently frequently used the phrase "no illusions" to describe the views of both sides on each other's intentions.

    On the German issue, West Germany has always been dissatisfied with France's lack of serious support for its policy of annexing the German Democratic Republic. Just a few days before Erhard's visit to France, the French announcement that de Gaulle would visit the Soviet Union in June of this year added to West Germany's concerns. It is said that an important purpose of Erhard's visit to Paris this time was to find out the purpose of de Gaulle's visit to the Soviet Union in June, hoping that France would support West Germany on the so-called "German reunification" issue. However, the answer he received, according to Erhard, was that de Gaulle "will raise the issue of Europe, especially the issue of German reunification, from the French point of view."

    The two countries have always had differences in their attitude towards the United States' aggression against Vietnam. France does not support the United States' military intervention. West Germany not only cheers for the United States' aggressive policy, but also provides financial and material assistance to the South Vietnamese puppet regime.

    Of course, in Franco-German relations, we should also see the other side: in a considerable period, it will not develop to the degree of open confrontation and rupture, because this is not in the interest of either side. For France, an open break would plunge itself into the isolation that the United States hopes to promote. For West Germany, despite its economic strength, it has not completely shaken off its inferior position politically, and it still needs France in many aspects. Moreover, on some issues (such as in the international monetary struggle), both sides also have common interests and need to unite to deal with the United States and Britain. The recent end of the "Common Market" crisis with a temporary compromise between the two sides and the absence of quarrels in this meeting illustrate this point. However, people cannot fail to see that in the foreign policies of the two countries, the elements of mutual restraint and prevention are constantly increasing, and the factors of rivalry and confrontation between the two sides are greater than the factors of collusion and unity.

### 从巴黎会谈看一年来的法国西德关系

    从巴黎会谈看一年来的法国西德关系
    法国西德的矛盾一年来有了发展。虽然由于相互利用的需要，双方关系在相当时期内还不会发展到破裂和对抗，但是现在相互争霸的因素已经大于联合的因素了。
    半年一次的法国、西德首脑会谈八日结束。会谈上虽然没有发生激烈争吵，但是除了在西欧“政治合作”上许下了一句空洞的诺言和在科学、技术合作问题上进行了一些讨论以外，双方在一系列重大问题上的分歧依然如故。
    法国—西德关系的恶化，是一年来西方国家间错综复杂的矛盾中的一个重要的方面。关键问题是双方在同美国的关系上奉行着两条根本不同的路线。在这方面，双方的分道扬镖早在艾哈德上台后不久就渐渐明显了。如今，随着艾哈德变得越来越亲美，法国和西德是愈走愈远了。一九六五年一月郎布依埃会谈时，艾哈德政府为了摆脱当时的孤立处境，曾经一度做出向法国稍稍靠拢的姿态。但是昙花一现，事态很快证明，这毕竟只是个姿态。在美国拉拢、怂恿下，艾哈德政府企图充当美国第一号
  “亲密伙伴”的野心日益明朗。巴黎发现，西德大选后，艾哈德政府的亲美政策更加定型了。尽管艾哈德并不愿意在美法之间公开断然作出选择，实际上，他处处追随美国的行动势必严重影响和法国的关系，使它们在一系列问题上的矛盾更加复杂和尖锐。
    西德核武装问题是它们之间的一个重大矛盾。西德越来越露骨地想依靠美国染指核武器的要求，引起了法国方面很大的疑惧。《费加罗报》在一篇文章中写道，几年以前，戴高乐主义者并不排除这样一种可能，即法国让西德参加计划中的“欧洲核打击力量”。“目前，法国采取了明确的态度。它不仅反对多边核力量，而且也反对德国以任何形式参加大西洋联盟核战略。”一九六四年底，双方在多边核力量问题上大交锋了一场。一九六五年底，美国通过建立北大西洋公约组织核问题特别委员会企图给予西德在核战略问题上的发言权。法国对此抱着坚决反对的态度。双方明知在这个问题上的矛盾很难调和，所以在这次会谈中根本没有谈这个问题。
    在建立“小欧洲”的问题上，西德主张建立一个由美国领导、让西德占优势的“大西洋的欧洲”，法国则主张建立一个同美国抗衡的“欧洲人的欧洲”。双方在政治目标上既然是背道而驰，在一些经济上的矛盾就变得更加难以解决。西欧六国“共同市场”在一九六五年的空前严重和持久的危机虽然在经济问题上爆发，但也是政治矛盾的一个反映。
    在这种情况下，在法国政府看来，西德已不再是法国走向建立“欧洲人的欧洲”这一战略目标的同路伙伴，却成了美国重点扶植的同自己争霸西欧的对手。在西德艾哈德政府眼中，法国可以被利用来抬高自己国际地位的那种作用也在逐渐减少，相反，它阻碍实现西德野心的作用却在逐渐增加。在这一方面，法国报纸近来经常用“不抱幻想”这一词句，来形容双方对对方意图的看法。
    在德国问题上，西德一向不满法国不认真支持它的吞并德意志民主共和国的政策。就在艾哈德访法前几天，法国宣布戴高乐将在今年六月访问苏联一事又增加了西德的疑虑。据说，艾哈德在这次巴黎会谈中的一个重要目的就是想探听戴高乐六月访苏的目的，希望法国在所谓“德国重新统一”问题上支持西德，然而所得到的答复，据艾哈德说，只是戴高乐“将从法国的观点来提欧洲问题，特别是德国重新统一问题”。
    在对待美国侵略越南的态度上，两国间一直存在分歧。法国不支持美国的军事干涉。西德则不仅为美国的侵略政策摇旗呐喊，而且给南越傀儡政权提供财政和物质援助。
    当然，在法德关系中，还应该看到另外一面：在相当时期内，还不会发展到公开对抗、破裂的程度，因为这对双方都不利。对法国说，公开分手就使自己陷入正是美国所希望促成的孤立，对西德说，尽管经济上羽毛丰满，在政治上还没有完全摆脱低人一头的地位，不少方面还有求于法国。而且在若干问题上（例如在国际货币斗争中），双方也有共同利益，需要联合起来对付美英。最近，“共同市场”危机以双方暂时妥协告一段落以及这次会谈中没有发生争吵都说明了这一点。然而，人们却不能不看到，在两国外交政策中，互相掣肘、防范的成分正在不断增长，双方争霸对抗的因素已经大于勾结、联合的因素。　（据新华社）
