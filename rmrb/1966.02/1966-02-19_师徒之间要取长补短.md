    I have been a worker for over ten years. Under the education of the Party, I have made great progress in both ideology and technology. Now I have become a master craftsman, a sixth-grade worker. My relationship with my apprentices has been relatively good over the years, but there are also some problems. The main problem is that some old rules from the old society still remain in my mind. I thought that "the master is always a cut above the apprentice," "in technology, the master's word is law, and the apprentice obeys blindly," and "in production, the apprentice only learns and doesn't offer opinions."
    Once, when modifying a copying punch press, apprentice Hui Zhicheng and I tried more than ten times, but we could not solve the technical problem of the damper not working properly. Just as I was racking my brains, the apprentice tentatively raised a question in front of everyone. He said, "Master Wang, could the damper be malfunctioning because the air pressure is too high?" When I heard this, I was not in a good mood. I thought to myself, you haven't even been an apprentice for two and a half days, what do you know? I've been through more things than you've even heard of. You should honestly learn a few tricks. At the time, I said, "Don't talk nonsense, just drive the machine." Then I tried twice more according to my own ideas, but failed again. The failure forced me to think over and over again, and the more I thought about it, the more I felt that the apprentice's opinion made sense. But trying it out according to the apprentice's opinion would make me lose face, and I blamed the apprentice for undermining me in front of everyone. However, we couldn't delay production, so I indirectly tried it out according to the apprentice's opinion, and it turned out that the problem was indeed with the high air pressure. The technical problem was found, and the innovation of the punch press was quickly successful. While finding the technical problem, I also discovered my own ideological shortcomings, forcing me, as a master, to think carefully.
    I consulted Chairman Mao's works with this question. Chairman Mao taught us that we should look at problems "dividing one into two" and not use a metaphysical, isolated, static, and one-sided perspective to look at things. That is to say, we must have dialectics. I thought about it, and I lacked a "two-part approach" to the apprentice; I only saw the apprentice's technical shortcomings, but not the politically active, enthusiastic, and least conservative side; I only saw my own correct points, but not the apprentice's correct points. Nothing in the world is absolute, and technology is the same. No matter how high a person's level is or how rich his experience is, he can only understand objective things to a certain extent, not fully. An apprentice's production experience may be a little worse than the master's, but his understanding of certain problems may exceed the master's. The punch press damper was not working, and I only considered the larger parts, but Xiao Hui paid attention to the accessories, and he was better than me in this regard, which is worth learning. Masters and apprentices each have their own strengths, and the correct attitude is to learn from each other's strengths, respect each other, learn from each other, and move forward hand in hand. Putting on the airs of a master and thinking that one's own opinion is absolutely correct is not right.
    When I linked the handling of the relationship between master and apprentice to dialectics, I listened to the apprentice's opinions. Recently, when we were producing a new product, we accepted the suggestion of Lv Weixian, a second-grade worker, to control tolerances, reduced a process, and adopted the glass fiber cutting plan proposed by Li Maokun, a recently entered apprentice, so that the production task was completed two days ahead of schedule. More importantly, the relationship between our masters and apprentices and between the old and new workers is becoming more and more harmonious. In the past, when apprentices worked with me, they were afraid to speak their minds and were timid; now they dare to speak their minds, and their enthusiasm and initiative have been mobilized, and production is becoming more and more satisfactory.

    师徒之间要取长补短
    钳工　王志贤
    我当工人已经十多年了，在党的教育下，无论在思想上、技术上都有了很大的提高。现在我已经当了师傅，是六级工了。我和徒弟之间的关系，几年来是比较好的，可也存在一些问题。主要是我脑子里还残存一些旧社会的老规矩，以为
  “师傅就比徒弟高一头”，“在技术上师傅说一不二，徒弟唯命是从”，“在生产上徒弟只有学的份，没有提意见的份。”
    有一次，改装仿型冲压机，我和徒弟惠志诚经过十几次试验，也没有解决风门动作不灵的技术难题。正在我挠头的时候，徒弟用试探的口气在众人面前提出了个问题。他说：“王师傅，风门不灵是不是风压过大啦！”我一听，心里就没有好气，心里想：你满徒还不到两天半，懂得个啥，我经过的事，比你听的还多哩，你老老实实学两手吧。当时我就说：“瞎说啥，叫你开车，你就开车好了。”接着又按我想的办法试验了两次，结果又失败了。失败逼着我反反复复地想，越想越觉得徒弟的意见有道理。可是要按照徒弟的意见试验一下吧，在脸面上又觉得不好看，心里埋怨徒弟不该在众人面前拆我的台。但是不能耽误生产，我就拐弯抹角地按照徒弟的意见试验了，结果毛病确实是出在风压大的问题上面。技术上的毛病找到了，冲压机的革新很快成功了。在找到了技术毛病的同时，更使我发现了思想上的缺陷，逼着我当师傅的要好好地想一想。
    我带着这个问题向毛主席著作请教。毛主席教导我们，看问题要“一分为二”，不能用形而上学孤立、静止、片面的眼光来看待事物。也就是说要有辩证法。我想了想，我对徒弟就缺少个“两分法”；只看见徒弟技术不足的一面，看不到政治上积极、热情、最少保守的一面；只看到自己正确的地方，看不到徒弟正确的地方。天底下什么事都不是绝对的，技术也是这样，一个人不论他水平多高，经验多丰富，他对客观事物也只能认识到一定程度，不能全认识。徒工的生产经验可能比师傅差一点，但是对某些问题的认识，又可能超出师傅。冲压机风门不灵，我只从大的部位考虑了，小惠却注意了附件，他在这一点上就比我高明，值得我学习。师傅和徒弟各有所长，正确的态度是取长补短，互相尊重，互相学习，携手前进。摆个师傅架子，以为自己的意见绝对正确，这是不对的。
    当把处理师徒之间的关系同辩证法挂上钩的时候，我对徒弟的意见就听进去了。最近我们生产一种新产品时，接受了二级工吕维先提出的控制公差的建议，减少了一道工序采用了刚入厂的徒工李茂坤提出的割玻璃丝的方案，使生产任务提前两天完成。更重要的是我们师徒之间、新老工人之间的关系越来越融洽了，过去徒弟跟我干活，心里有话不敢说，小手小脚；现在有话敢说了，积极性和主动性调动了起来，生产越搞越顺心。
