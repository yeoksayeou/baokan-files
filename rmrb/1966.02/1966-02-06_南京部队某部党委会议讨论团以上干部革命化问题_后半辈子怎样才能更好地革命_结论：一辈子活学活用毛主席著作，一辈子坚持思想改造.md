    Nanjing Military Region Party Committee Meeting Discusses the Revolutionization of Cadres Above the Regiment Level
    How to Better Revolutionize in the Second Half of Life
    Conclusion: Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Works in a Living Way for a Lifetime, Persist in Ideological Remolding for a Lifetime
    (Xinhua Daily Report) The Party Committee of a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Nanjing Military Region recently held an enlarged meeting to discuss an important question: How can leading cadres above the regiment level better revolutionize in the second half of their lives? The unanimous conclusion was: The key lies in regarding the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works as a lifelong combat task, making revolution for a lifetime, remolding ideology for a lifetime, and firmly establishing a communist world outlook.
    Is it Enough to Rely on "Past Achievements"?
    At the discussion, some comrades said that in the past they thought that after many years of cultivation and education by the Party, they had always followed the Party, listened to Chairman Mao, and served the people wholeheartedly in the first half of their lives. Even if the problem of serving the people to the end could not be said to be completely solved, it could be said to be basically solved. Relying on these "past achievements," there would not be any major problems in the second half of their lives.
    Everyone analyzed and criticized this idea of "relying on past achievements" from the viewpoint of "one divides into two." They believed that there was a connection between a revolutionary's revolution in the first half of their life and revolution in the second half of their life. Revolution in the first half of their life was the foundation for continuing the revolution in the second half of their life. However, having this foundation cannot replace ideological remolding in the second half of life. Some comrades said: The ideological remolding of veteran cadres should also be viewed from the perspective of "two points." On the one hand, they have undergone wars and other tests, their positions are relatively firm, and their awareness is relatively high. They have a strong "resistance" to the erosion of various non-proletarian ideas. However, ideological remolding cannot be completely completed in half a lifetime, nor can it remain unchanged. If this "resistance" is regarded as absolute, lying on "past achievements" and falling into blind complacency, the problem will transform in the opposite direction. No matter how strong your past ideological foundation is, relaxing continued remolding will make it impossible to maintain revolutionary youth forever.
    Everyone then studied Chairman Mao's expositions on class struggle, and their vision became clearer. Some said: We all come from the old society, and some comrades even come from non-proletarian families. Everyone's mind is more or less branded with non-proletarian ideas. These brands are often very stubborn and not easy to eradicate completely. To make revolution for a lifetime, one must remold ideology for a lifetime. In addition, we still live in a society with classes, and the class struggle in the transitional period is more extensive and in-depth than the class struggle in the democratic revolution period. Even veteran cadres who have undergone long-term training, non-proletarian ideas may sneak into their minds. As long as classes and class struggle exist for one day, there will inevitably be a struggle between promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology in people's minds, and ideology must be constantly remolded. The conclusion was: History is constantly advancing, revolution is constantly developing, and if we do not regard the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works as a lifelong combat task and honestly continue to remold our ideology, then no matter how high your "wheels" climb, they will slide down from the hillside, and your "boat," even if it sails upstream, will be washed down by the adverse current.
    Adhere to High Standards, or be Content with "Passable"?
    Should ideological remolding be carried out according to high standards or low standards? Some comrades have this idea: I will always resolutely follow the Party and Chairman Mao. Even if there are some shortcomings in my thinking, can my political direction still be wrong?
    When studying this issue, everyone first affirmed that the reason why veteran cadres were able to make revolution in the first half of their lives was precisely the result of closely following the Party and Chairman Mao and arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. However, in order to continue to follow the Party and Chairman Mao in the future, and to truly keep up and keep up well, we must continue to further arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Adhering to the correct political direction is inseparable from thorough ideological remolding. Failing to block an anthill can lead to the collapse of a great dike. The "quantitative change" in ideology will form a "qualitative change" under certain conditions. Therefore, ideological remolding must adhere to high standards, not be content with "passable," but make one's overall thinking "strong."
    Everyone also realized that leading cadres are the backbone of the Party and the army. In wartime, they must lead troops to fight, and in peacetime, they must lead the construction of the army. Therefore, they must be thorough and conscious revolutionaries. Not only must they establish the idea of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and everything for the revolution, but they should also understand the laws of revolutionary development, the strategy and art of struggle, and so on. In short, they must use communist ideals to spur themselves, use communist spirit to cultivate themselves, and use communist thought to demand themselves, so that their thinking gradually reaches the communist ideological realm. To achieve this high standard, we must adhere to the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly remold our ideology, and realize revolutionization.
    Where Should the Focus of Ideological Remolding be Placed?
    Where should the focus of ideological remolding be placed? Some comrades believe that as leading cadres, the main task of ideological remolding is to remold their way of thinking. Everyone believes that in ideological remolding, the way of thinking must be remolded, but the ideology and consciousness must be remolded even more. Only by first remolding the ideology and consciousness can the way of thinking be thoroughly remolded. Some people only emphasize the remolding of the way of thinking, but not the remolding of the ideology and consciousness. This is both a manifestation of arrogance and complacency, and a reason for being afraid of pain and lacking combativeness in ideological remolding.
    Many comrades pointed out that the process of the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works and ideological remolding is a process of self-revolution and self-struggle. Without the determination of self-revolution and without daring to "operate" on the most painful part of one's ideology, ideological remolding will not achieve a "bumper harvest."
    Remolding ideology and consciousness requires a thorough revolutionary spirit and the courage to engage in self-revolution and to "reveal" the problems in one's own ideology and consciousness. Do not avoid seeking medical treatment for fear of disease, do not be afraid of pain, do not dodge, and do not be afraid of affecting one's own "prestige." Wherever the "scab" on the body hurts the most, first expose the "scab." Only in this way can the problem be truly solved. Many comrades have said that daring to fire on the "I" is the central link in ideological remolding. To "draw blood with the bayonet" in one's own ideological remolding, the core issue is to launch ideological struggle, eliminate the "I," and ensure that the "I" is not emphasized in the face of achievements, that the "I" is not evaded in the face of problems, and that the "I" is not emphasized in the event of differences of opinion. In short, the further away from the "I," the further the ideological remolding progresses. The further away from the "I," the greater the progress in ideological remolding.
    Finally, everyone also mentioned that in order to revolutionize the ideology of leading cadres, they must also go to practice to remold themselves according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Going to the company and the vast world of mass struggle is a good "hospital" for eradicating individualism.

    南京部队某部党委会议讨论团以上干部革命化问题
    后半辈子怎样才能更好地革命
    结论：一辈子活学活用毛主席著作，一辈子坚持思想改造
    据新华日报报道：中国人民解放军南京部队某部最近召开的党委扩大会议，讨论了一个重要问题：团以上领导干部后半辈子怎样才能更好地革命？一致的结论是：关键在于把活学活用毛主席著作当作毕生的战斗任务，革一辈子命，改造一辈子思想，牢固地树立共产主义世界观。
    光凭“老本”行不行？
    在讨论会上，个别同志说，过去以为自己经过党多年的培养教育，前半辈子一直跟着党走，听毛主席的话，为人民服务到底的问题，即使不能说完全解决，也可以说基本上解决了，凭这些“老本”，后半辈子也不会出什么大问题。
    大家用一分为二的观点，分析、批判了这种“靠老本吃饭”的思想。大家认为，一个革命者，前半辈子革命和后半辈子革命，是有联系的，前半辈子革命是后半辈子继续革命的基础。但是，有了这个基础，并不能代替后半辈子的思想改造。有的同志说：老干部的思想改造，也应该用两分法来看。一方面，他们经过战争和其它考验，立场比较坚定，觉悟比较高，对于各种非无产阶级思想的侵蚀，有较强的“抵抗力”。但是，人的思想改造不是半辈子就可以彻底完成的，也不可能是一成不变的。如果把这种“抵抗力”看得绝对化了，躺在“老本”上睡觉，盲目自满起来，问题就会向相反的方面转化。不管你过去思想基础多么雄厚，放松了继续改造，就不可能永葆革命青春。
    大家接着学习了毛主席有关阶级斗争的论述，眼睛更亮了。有的说：我们都来自旧社会，有的同志还出身于非无产阶级家庭，每个人的头脑里都或多或少地被打上了非无产阶级思想的烙印。这些烙印，往往很顽固，不易彻底根除，要革命一辈子，就得改造一辈子。另外，我们还生活在有阶级的社会里，过渡时期的阶级斗争比民主革命时期的阶级斗争要广泛深入得多，即使是经过长期锻炼的老干部，非无产阶级思想，也可能会钻到自己的头脑里来。只要阶级和阶级斗争存在一天，人的思想就一定会有兴无灭资的斗争，就要不断地改造思想。大家的结论是：历史是永远前进的，革命是永远发展的，不把活学活用毛主席著作当成毕生的战斗任务，老老实实地继续不断地改造思想，那么，你的“车轮”不管爬到多高，也会从半坡上滑下来，你的“船”就是开到上游，也会被逆流冲下去。
    坚持高标准，还是满足于“过得去”？
    改造思想是按照高标准还是按照低标准？个别同志有这种想法：我总是要坚决跟着党和毛主席走的，即使思想上有一些缺点，政治方向还错得了吗？
    大家在研究这个问题时，首先肯定，老干部上半辈子所以能够革命，正是紧紧跟着党和毛主席走，用毛泽东思想武装头脑的结果。但是，今后要继续跟着党和毛主席走，要真正跟得上，跟得好，必须继续不断地用毛泽东思想进一步武装自己才行。坚持正确的政治方向和彻底的改造思想是分不开的，一蚁之穴不堵，可能决一大堤，思想上的“量变”到一定条件下就会形成“质变”。因此，思想改造一定要坚持高标准，不能满足于“过得去”，而要自己的全盘思想都“过得硬”。
    大家还认识到，领导干部是党和军队的骨干，战时要带着部队打仗，平时要领导部队建设，因此必须作一个彻底自觉的革命者。不仅要树立一心为革命、一切为革命的思想，还应该懂得革命发展的规律、斗争的策略和艺术等等。总之，要用共产主义理想来鞭策自己，要用共产主义精神来培养自己，要用共产主义思想来要求自己，使自己思想逐步达到共产主义的思想境界。要达到这一高标准，一定要坚持活学活用毛主席著作，彻底改造思想，实现革命化。
    思想改造的重点放在哪里？
    思想改造的重点应当放在哪里呢？有的同志认为，作为领导干部，改造思想主要是改造好思想方法。大家认为：在改造思想中，思想方法要改造，思想意识更要改造，而且只有首先改造好思想意识，才可能彻底改造好思想方法。有些人只强调思想方法的改造，而不强调思想意识的改造，这既是骄傲自满的表现，又是在思想改造上怕痒怕痛、缺乏战斗性的缘故。
    许多同志指出，活学活用毛主席著作、改造思想的过程，就是自我革命、自我斗争的过程，没有自我革命的决心，不敢迎着自己思想最痛处“开刀”，改造思想是不会获得“丰收”的。
    改造思想意识，前提是要有彻底革命的精神，要敢于自我革命，敢于“亮”出自己思想意识上的问题。不要讳疾忌医，不要怕痒怕痛，不要躲躲闪闪，不要怕影响自己的“威信”。身上那里的“疮疤”最痛，就首先揭那里的“疮疤”，只有这样，才能真正解决问题。许多同志都谈到，敢于向“我”字开火，是思想改造的中心环节。要在自己思想改造上“刺刀见红”，核心问题是展开思想斗争，打掉一个“我”字，做到在成绩面前不突出“我”字，在问题面前不回避“我”字，在意见分歧时不强调“我”字。总之，离“我”字远一分，思想改造就进一尺；离“我”字远一丈，思想改造就进百丈。
    最后，大家还谈到，要使领导干部的思想革命化，还必须根据毛主席的教导，到实践中去改造自己。到连队去，到群众斗争的广阔天地中去，是根除个人主义的一个好“医院”。
