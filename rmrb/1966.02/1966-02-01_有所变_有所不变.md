    Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change; we must work hard, we must make revolution." In our country, we often see that the poorer a factory is, the greater its revolutionary zeal. This is the reason.

    Under the leadership of our Party, revolution always brings the expected results: material conditions greatly change, or fundamentally change, that is, from poor to rich. This is a universal phenomenon.

    What happens after becoming rich? Is it continued revolution or stagnation?

    The Chongqing Nan'an Leather Factory has set a good example. This cooperative, which once relied on a few awls and hammers, state loans, and advance payments from state-owned enterprises to maintain production, has, after several years of hard work, developed into a state-owned factory with hundreds of machines, producing 200,000 pairs of leather shoes annually, and paying hundreds of thousands of yuan in profits annually. It has truly changed from poor to rich, but no matter how much changes, the pioneering spirit of hard struggle has not changed, and the proletarian revolutionary character has not changed. In summary, the good tradition of acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions has not changed.

    For an enterprise, when material conditions are very difficult and very poor, instead of being disheartened and accomplishing nothing, it should work hard, start a business diligently and thriftily, and become more revolutionary the poorer it is. This revolutionary spirit of "poverty does not diminish ambition" is valuable. Once material conditions change and become prosperous, being able to continue to work hard as always, this spirit of continuous revolution is even more valuable.

      "Born in sorrow, die in comfort." Since ancient times, a comfortable environment has eroded the lofty ambitions of many and ruined the bright future of many. However, thorough proletarian revolutionaries can overthrow this saying and eradicate this phenomenon. When conditions are poor, they make revolution; when conditions are good, they also make revolution. Revolution when poor, revolution when rich, revolution to the end. What we mean by something changing is that the state of being "poor and blank" must change. What we mean by something remaining unchanged is that the spirit of continuous revolution cannot change.

    A thorough proletarian revolutionary should "take the world as their responsibility." They make revolution not only to get rid of their own poverty; more importantly, it is to liberate all the working people of the world. When an enterprise changes from poor to rich, it should be remembered that the entire country is still "poor and blank." Therefore, this is far from the end of the revolution, but rather the beginning of making a greater contribution to the entire revolutionary cause.

    This is what we often say, "Have the motherland in mind, have the world in view." If the cadres and workers of an enterprise have such great revolutionary aspirations, they can be like the Chongqing Nan'an Leather Factory, forever moving forward and forever making revolution, no matter what the conditions!

### 有所变  有所不变

    有所变  有所不变
    毛泽东同志说过：“穷则思变，要干，要革命。”在我们国家，常常看到，一个工厂越穷，它的革命干劲越大。就是这个道理。
    在我们党的领导下，革命总是带来预期的结果：物质条件大大改变了，或者根本改变了，也就是由穷变富了。这是普遍的现象。
    富了以后又怎样呢？是继续革命还是停顿不前呢？
    重庆南岸皮革厂树立了一个好榜样。这个曾经是靠着几把锥子和鎯头，靠着国家贷款和国营企业预付订金维持生产的合作社，经过几年的艰苦奋斗，已经发展成一个拥有上百台机器设备，年产二十万双皮鞋，年缴数十万元利润的国营工厂。它真正是由穷变富了，但是，千变万变，艰苦奋斗的创业精神没有变，无产阶级的革命本色没有变。总起来说，按照毛主席的指示办事的好传统没有变。
    一个企业，在物质条件很困难、很穷的时候，不是人穷志短，无所作为，而是艰苦奋斗，勤俭创业，越穷越革命，这种“穷不夺志”的革命精神是可贵的。一旦物质条件改变了，富裕了，仍能一如既往，艰苦奋斗，这种不断革命的精神更加可贵。
      “生于忧患，死于安乐”。自古以来，优裕的环境消磨了多少人的壮志雄心，葬送了多少人的美好前程。然而，彻底的无产阶级革命者，能够推翻这种说法，根绝这种现象。条件差的时候，他们革命；条件好的时候，他们也革命。穷也革命，富也革命，革命到底。我们所说的有所变，就是指“一穷二白”的状况一定要变。我们所说的有所不变，就是指的不断革命的精神不能变。
    一个彻底的无产阶级革命者，应该“以天下为己任”。他们革命，不只是为了摆脱自己的贫穷状况；更重要的，还是为了使普天下的劳动人民通通得到解放。当一个企业由穷变富的时候，应该想到整个国家还是“一穷二白”。因而这就远不是革命的终结，而是为整个革命事业作出更大贡献的开端。
    这就是我们常说的“胸怀祖国，放眼世界”。一个企业的干部和工人，有了这种伟大的革命抱负，就能象重庆南岸皮革厂那样，不管在任何条件下，永远前进，永远革命！
