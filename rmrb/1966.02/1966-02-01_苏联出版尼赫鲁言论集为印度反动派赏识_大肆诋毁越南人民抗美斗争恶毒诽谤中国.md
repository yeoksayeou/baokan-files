    Xinhua News Agency, January 31st - The Soviet Union's "Progress" Publishing House published a collection of speeches by former Indian Prime Minister Nehru, entitled "India's Foreign Policy," using Nehru's words to viciously slander the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and to maliciously defame China. Soviet Deputy Doctor Smirnov, in his preface to this book, went to great lengths to praise Nehru and extol his policy positions.
    This book conspicuously selects Nehru's speeches, disregarding the universally known fact of American imperialist aggression against Vietnam, openly providing cover for the American aggressors, and at the same time, wantonly insulting the Vietnamese people, nonsensically claiming that the Vietnam War was caused by the "intervention" of various "major power blocs" and the mutual creation of "trouble" between North and South Vietnam. The book even asserts, "The North Vietnamese government is accused of constantly causing trouble for the South Vietnamese government, and the North Vietnamese government accuses the South Vietnamese government of causing trouble and doing many things that it should not do. ... There is no doubt that there are many acts of violence. It is difficult for me to say whether the violence was used by the local people, local groups, or people from outside; probably both sides did so." This book says, without distinguishing right from wrong, "When one major power bloc takes action, another major power bloc will do the same, and then a war breaks out, and then the scale of the war becomes larger and larger." At that time, "the poor Vietnamese government and people will become the toys of major conflicts, which will be very unfortunate."
    This book also specifically selects Nehru's speeches that repeatedly launched vicious attacks on China, slandering China for adopting an "aggressive posture" towards India, defaming China's development of normal relations with Pakistan based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as being "purely for aggression against India," and attacking China for not signing the Moscow Partial Test Ban Treaty concocted by the United States and the Soviet Union. This book even lists our territory of Tibet alongside countries such as Afghanistan, Nepal, and Bhutan, claiming that India particularly expects their "cooperation and close friendship."
    Smirnov, in the preface to this book, lavishly praises the Indian government's foreign policy, saying that it "is praised by peace-loving countries" and "promotes not only Asia but also the stability of the entire world situation." This Soviet author promotes Nehru as an "ardent peace fighter," saying that "he made an inestimable contribution to the development of close and multifaceted cooperation between India and the Soviet Union."
    This book, entitled "India's Foreign Policy," edited by the Soviet Kairelev, was printed on September 25th of last year and went on sale in Moscow not long ago. It was immediately appreciated by the Indian reactionaries. A report issued by the Indian Press Trust on December 31st from Moscow particularly appreciates this Soviet "carefully selected" collection of Nehru's speeches, "including Nehru's criticisms of China's aggressive conspiracies against India, and the collusion between China and Pakistan against India," etc.

    苏联出版尼赫鲁言论集为印度反动派赏识
    大肆诋毁越南人民抗美斗争恶毒诽谤中国
    新华社三十一日讯　苏联《进步》出版社出版了印度前总理尼赫鲁的言论集，书名叫《印度的外交政策》，借尼赫鲁的话，大肆诋毁越南人民的抗美救国斗争，并且恶毒地诽谤中国。苏联的斯米尔诺夫副博士在为这本书写的前言中竭力吹捧尼赫鲁，赞扬他的这些政策主张。
    这本书引人注目地选用了尼赫鲁的演说，不顾人所共知的美帝国主义侵略越南的事实，公然为美国侵略者打掩护，同时恣意侮辱越南人民，胡说什么越南战争是由于各
  “大国集团”竞相“干预”和越南南北方互相制造“麻烦”而引起的。书中竟然断言，“北越政府受到指责，说它经常给南越政府制造麻烦，北越政府则指责南越政府制造麻烦和做了许多不应当做的事。……毫无疑问是有许多暴力行为的。究竟是住在当地的人，当地的集团，还是来自外界的人使用了暴力，我是很难说的，大概双方都这样做了”。这本书不分是非地说，“一个大国集团进行活动，另一个大国集团也会这么做，然后发生战争，接着战争规模越来越大”。到那时，“可怜的越南政府和人民就会成为重大冲突的玩具，这将是很不幸的”。
    这本书还特别选用了尼赫鲁多次对中国进行恶毒攻击的讲话，污蔑中国对印度采取了“侵略架式”，诽谤中国同巴基斯坦基于和平共处五项原则发展两国之间的正常关系是“纯粹为了侵略印度”，攻击中国不在美苏合作炮制的莫斯科三国部分禁试条约上签字。这本书居然还把我国领土西藏与阿富汗、尼泊尔、不丹等国家并列，声称印度特别期望它们的“合作和亲密的友谊”。
    斯米尔诺夫在这本书的前言中大肆吹捧印度政府的外交政策，说它“受到各爱好和平的国家赞扬”，“不仅促进了亚洲，而且也促进了整个世界局势的稳定”。这位苏联作者宣扬尼赫鲁是“热情的和平战士”，“他对发展印度和苏联之间紧密和多方面的合作作出了无法估计的贡献”。
    这本由苏联的凯拉寥夫编辑的名为《印度的外交政策》的书是在去年九月二十五日付印的，不久前在莫斯科出售。它立即受到印度反动派的赏识。印度报业托辣斯十二月三十一日从莫斯科发出的报道，特别欣赏这本苏联“精选”的尼赫鲁言论集中，“包括尼赫鲁抨击中国对印度的侵略阴谋，中巴勾结起来反对印度”等等。
