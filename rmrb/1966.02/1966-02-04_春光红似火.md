    Spring Light as Red as Fire
    Worker of Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory, Li Junde
  Everyone learns from Daqing,
  Machine tools sing triumphant songs,
  Workshops joyfully welcome spring,
  Spring light as red as fire.
  Spring light as red as fire,
  Many revolutionary iron men,
  Knives fly, steel flowers bloom,
  Each one surpasses the others.
  Cadres at the front line,
  Handle firmly grasped in hand,
  Taking the lead in charging,
  Not showing any weakness!
  Compare, learn, catch up, and help,
  Each one competes with the other,
  Competing for an early spring,
  Competing for a good style.
  The new Five-Year Plan,
  This is the third one,
  January production is busy,
  Spring light as red as fire.
  Spring light as red as fire,
  Ten thousand Daqing flowers,
  Blooming in the workshop,
  Fragrance floats across the country!

    春光红似火
    北京广播器材厂工人　李俊德
  人人学大庆，
  机床奏凯歌，
  车间喜迎春，
  春光红似火。
  春光红似火，
  革命铁人多，
  刀飞钢花开，
  一朵胜一朵。
  干部在前线，
  摇把手中握，
  带头打冲锋，
  一点不示弱！
  比学赶帮超，
  一个赛一个，
  赛的春来早，
  赛出好风格。
  五年新计划，
  这是第三个，
  元月生产忙，
  春光红似火。
  春光红似火，
  大庆花万朵，
  开在车间里，
  花香飘全国！
