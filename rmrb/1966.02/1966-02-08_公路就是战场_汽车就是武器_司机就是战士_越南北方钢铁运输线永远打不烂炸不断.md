    The Highway is the Battlefield, the Vehicle is the Weapon, the Driver is the Soldier
    The Steel Transportation Line in North Vietnam Can Never Be Smashed or Severed by Bombing
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Dispatch: Our correspondent reports: Under the slogan of "The highway is the battlefield, the vehicle is the weapon, and the driver is the soldier," workers in the transportation departments of North Vietnam, disregarding the frenzied bombing of the American bandit planes, overcoming all difficulties, operating continuously, rapidly, and safely, are continuously delivering supplies to the front lines, supporting the front, supporting the battle, and determined to defeat the American bandits on the transportation front.
    The drivers of the Sixth Motor Transport Company of Hanoi, in the competition of "Guaranteeing transportation and determined to defeat the American bandits," braved the dangers of enemy aircraft bombing, overcame the numerous difficulties and obstacles caused by torrential rains and mountain floods, crossed mountains and valleys, crossed rapid currents, feared neither slippery roads nor steep slopes, and intensified transportation day and night, completing one emergency transportation task after another with resourcefulness and bravery.
    The Hanoi Transportation Department has also trained more than 1,300 motor vehicle drivers and repairmen for various motorcades, which has timely met the needs on the transportation front.
    The Haiphong Transportation Department not only excellently completes various transportation tasks, but also actively organizes operational exercises for various wartime transportation tools, so that many employees achieve "proficiency in one skill and versatility in many." Many ferry workers and sailors have skillfully mastered the driving of ships and other technologies. Many bridge engineering teams have also guided employees to learn technologies such as erecting pontoon bridges and repairing bridges to ensure smooth wartime transportation.
    In order to adapt to the requirements of wartime transportation, transportation departments in various places have also paid special attention to the development of simple transportation. Many bicycle transportation teams and ox cart and horse-drawn cart transportation groups have been successively established in various places, and many simple transportation tools have been manufactured.
    At the same time, various provinces have also newly built and repaired a large number of highways. In Nghệ An province, the people have always persisted in the project of repairing highways under the frequent bombing and strafing of enemy planes. In the past year, they have built more than 5,700 kilometers of highways. Provinces and cities such as Nam Hà, Lai Châu, Hòa Bình, Hải Phòng, Hà Giang, and Tuyên Quang have also newly opened up many new roads. Thanh Liêm County in Nam Hà province has widened almost all the small roads in the county. At present, all 24 townships in the county have highways, and almost every village is accessible by car. Hòa Bình province has also expanded and built more than 1,000 kilometers of highways. Three-quarters of the counties in the province are now accessible by car. At present, on the transportation lines in North Vietnam, tens of thousands of road construction workers, bridge workers, and sappers are fighting day and night, stepping up the construction of bridges, filling bomb craters, and paving roads, so that the steel transportation line in North Vietnam will never be smashed, never be severed by bombing, and will always be unimpeded.

    公路就是战场　汽车就是武器　司机就是战士
    越南北方钢铁运输线永远打不烂炸不断
    新华社河内电　本社记者报道：越南北方交通运输部门职工在“公路就是战场，汽车就是武器，司机就是战士”的口号下，不顾美国强盗飞机的狂轰滥炸，克服一切困难，连续、快速和安全运行，源源不断地把物资送到前方，支援前线，支援战斗，决心在交通运输战线上战胜美国强盗。
    河内市第六汽车运输公司的司机们，在“保证交通运输，决心战胜美国强盗”的竞赛中，冒着敌机轰炸的危险，克服了暴雨山洪造成的重重困难和障碍，翻山越岭，横渡急流，不怕路滑坡陡，不分昼夜地加紧运输，机智勇敢地完成了一次又一次紧急运输任务。
    河内市交通运输部门还为各个车队培养了一千三百多名汽车司机和修理工，及时满足了运输战线上的需要。
    海防市交通运输部门不仅良好地完成各种运输任务，而且还积极组织各种战时交通工具的操作演习，使很多职工都达到“一专多能”。许多轮渡工人、水手都熟练地掌握了驾驶轮船和其他技术。许多桥梁工程队还指导职工们学习架设浮桥和抢修桥梁等技术，保证战时运输畅通。
    为适应战时运输的要求，各地交通运输部门还特别注意发展简易交通运输。各地都先后成立了许多自行车运输队和牛车、马车运输组，制造了许多简易交通运输工具。
    与此同时，各省还新筑和修建了大量的公路。义安省人民在敌机频繁轰炸、扫射的情况下，始终坚持抢修公路的工程，一年来，已修建了五千七百多公里长的公路线。南河、莱州、和平、海防、河江、宣光等省市，也新开辟了许多新的道路。南河省清廉县把县内几乎所有的小路都加宽了。目前全县二十四个乡都有了公路，几乎村村都可通汽车。和平省也扩建和新建了一千多公里的公路。全省四分之三的县已经通了汽车。目前，在越南北方各条运输线上，数以万计的筑路工人、桥梁工人和工兵战士，正在日夜奋战，加紧修筑桥梁，填平弹坑，铺平道路，使越南北方的钢铁运输线永远打不烂，炸不断，永远畅通无阻。
