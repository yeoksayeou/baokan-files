    This newspaper reports that Shanxi Province's electric power departments are promoting Qixian County's experience of implementing a part-time work and part-time farming labor system for rural electricity management in forty-seven counties and cities across the province that handle electricity.

    The leading organs of this province believe that this is a major event. Qixian County's approach not only concerns the realization of the revolutionization of rural electricity management, but also concerns the faster, better, and more economical realization of electrification in rural areas throughout the province.

    Shanxi Province's rural electrification cause has developed rapidly in recent years. Currently, the province's rural power transmission lines are more than two and a half times the length of China's longest river, the Yangtze River. Agricultural electricity consumption has increased 486 times compared to 1957.

    Before 1959, there was no electricity in Qixian County's rural areas. Currently, most people's commune production teams in the county use electricity for agricultural production and lighting. Of the county's 453,000 mu of cultivated land, more than 106,000 mu use electric power for pumping irrigation. However, in the past, the power supply departments followed the method of managing industrial electricity use, only managing the more than 30 percent of high-voltage equipment directly invested in and built by the state. The remaining 70 percent of high-voltage equipment built by collectives and low-voltage equipment spread across communes and teams effectively lacked normal maintenance and management. Last March, under the leadership and coordination of the Qixian County Party Committee, the County People's Committee, and higher-level electric power departments, the Qixian Power Supply Station summarized its experiences and lessons over the years. It realized that to truly manage rural electricity well, it was first necessary to prioritize politics, educate employees to establish a firm ideology of serving agriculture, strengthen professional work, and mobilize the masses to manage electricity. This was necessary to adapt management work to the characteristics of long and widely distributed rural power grids, scattered equipment, and strong seasonality of electricity use, and to solve problems such as frequent rural electricity accidents, high losses, high costs, and low efficiency. Through in-depth investigation, the power supply station decided to promote the part-time work and part-time farming labor system in rural electricity management, with the power supply station organizing and guiding the commune production teams' part-time work and part-time farming electricians to uniformly manage rural high and low-voltage equipment.

    Qixian County's specific practices are: taking high-voltage main lines as the focus, combined with the commune administrative divisions, dividing the county's electricity-using communes and production brigades into five power supply service areas, with the Qixian Power Supply Station assigning one full-time electrician to each area to be stationed permanently in rural areas. The power supply station, through the mass-based electromechanical management organizations of the various electricity-using communes and teams, organized more than 140 commune and team part-time work and part-time farming electricians selected from across the county, letting them respectively take charge of the installation, operation, maintenance, repair, and various management tasks of high-voltage line equipment in their respective communes and teams. In each area, the "four determinations" method of determining groups by area, determining sections by group, determining poles by person, and determining work by task was adopted, dividing the part-time work and part-time farming electricians into several groups, specifically assigning the management work of each power pole and each transformer, as well as other equipment, to each person. These part-time work and part-time farming electricians do not leave agricultural production, with each person responsible for approximately two kilometers of high-voltage lines, four kilometers of low-voltage lines, and electricity management within a certain range. The power supply station pays wages for the labor days each of them spends on high-voltage equipment, and the communes and teams rationally distribute the wages and record work points for the electricians themselves. The county also organized the electromechanical personnel of each electricity-using commune and team with basic electricity knowledge into each part-time work and part-time farming electrician group, with the part-time work and part-time farming electricians leading them in learning and working, conducting on-the-spot training. To adapt to the needs of part-time work and part-time farming management work, the power supply station also reformed relevant rules and regulations.

    The Qixian County Party Committee attaches great importance to the rural electrification cause, and designated a responsible cadre to uniformly lead the electromechanical departments. Electromechanical Management Committees were established in the county, communes, and brigades to comprehensively arrange electromechanical work, unify steps, and strengthen leadership.

    The Qixian County Party Committee recently summarized the experience of rural electricity management and believes that implementing the part-time work and part-time farming labor system has many benefits. First, it embodies the advantages of unified leadership, integration of workers and peasants, mutual cooperation, and joint management. For example, in Ren Village Commune, when high-voltage lines were erected in 1963, the relevant county departments and the commune were responsible for the construction tasks, which were accepted by the power supply department. There was no connection between the two parties. Many problems were found during acceptance, and it took half a year to deliver electricity. Last year, the situation was very different when high-voltage lines were erected here. Full-time electricians and part-time work and part-time farming electricians jointly selected the line before construction and jointly participated in the construction. Electricity was delivered immediately after completion, which only took a month. Furthermore, the implementation of this part-time work and part-time farming labor system has resolved the contradiction between dispersed rural electrical equipment and centralized management, overcoming the shortcoming of using without maintaining. The vast majority of part-time work and part-time farming electricians can conduct inspections in accordance with the requirements of the equipment maintenance system. Therefore, they can discover and deal with accidents in a timely manner, ensuring normal power supply. The implementation of this system can also unify construction, operation, and use, jointly manage electricity, and promote technological reforms.

    The county's full-time electricians and part-time work and part-time farming electricians cooperate with each other, take into account the complete set of equipment, learn from each other, and improve together, and a new situation of "one worker with multiple skills, one position with multiple functions" has begun to emerge. Full-time electricians could only undertake repair tasks in the past, but now they can undertake all the work of repair, operation, charging, meter reading, and wiring.

    After the implementation of the part-time work and part-time farming labor system, the distribution lines and distribution transformers managed by the Qixian Power Supply Station have increased by nearly two times compared with the past, while the number of professional personnel has been reduced from the original 24 to 16. The people's communes and production teams have more convenient access to electricity. The county's electric irrigation equipment has played a huge role in the fight against drought.

    关系着农村多快好省地实现电气化的一件大事
    推行亦工亦农劳动制度管理农村用电
    山西省电业部门在几十个县市推广祁县经验
    本报讯　山西省电业部门，正在全省四十七个办电县、市，推行祁县在农村用电管理工作上实行亦工亦农劳动制度的经验。
    这个省的领导机关认为，这是一件大事情。祁县的这种做法，不仅关系着农村用电管理工作实现革命化的问题，而且关系着全省农村更加多快好省地实现电气化的问题。
    山西省农村电气化事业最近几年来发展迅速。现在，全省农村拥有的输电线路相当于我国最长的河流——长江的两倍半还多；农业用电量比一九五七年增加了四百八十六倍。
    祁县农村在一九五九年以前没有电。目前，这个县的大多数人民公社生产队已使用电力进行农业生产和照明。全县四十五万三千亩耕地中，使用电力抽水灌溉的面积已占十万六千多亩。但是，过去供电部门沿用管理工业用电的方法，只管全县百分之三十多的直接由国家投资兴建的高压设备，其余百分之七十由集体兴建的高压设备和遍布社队的低压设备，实际上都缺乏正常的维护管理。去年三月，祁县供电所在中共祁县县委、县人民委员会和上级电业部门的领导与配合下，总结了几年来的经验教训，认识到要真正管好农村用电，首先必须突出政治，教育职工树立牢固的为农业服务思想，既要加强专业工作，又要发动群众管电，才能使管理工作与农村电网线路长、分布广、设备分散、用电季节性强的特点相适应，和解决目前农村用电事故多、损耗大、成本高、效率低等问题。这个供电所就通过深入调查，决定在农村用电管理上推行亦工亦农劳动制度，由供电所组织和指导人民公社生产队的亦工亦农的电工，统一管理农村的高低压设备。
    祁县的具体做法是：以高压干线为主，结合公社行政区划，把全县用电的公社、生产大队划分为五个供电服务片，由祁县供电所按片各派一名专职电工常驻农村。供电所通过各用电社队的群众性机电管理组织，把在全县范围内挑选出来的一百四十多名社队亦工亦农的电工组织起来，让他们分别担任各所在社队高压线路设备的安装、运行、维护、检修和各项管理工作。在各个片，又采取了以片定组、以组定段、以人定杆、以活定工的“四定”方法，把亦工亦农电工分别划为若干小组，把每根电杆和每台变压器以及其它设备的管理工作具体落实到每个人。这些亦工亦农电工不脱离农业生产，平均每人负责二公里左右的高压线路、四公里左右的低压线路和一定范围内的用电管理工作。他们每人用于高压设备的劳动日，由供电所支付工资，由各社队进行合理分配，并给电工本人记工分。这个县还把各用电社队的具有粗浅用电知识的机电手也分别组织在各个亦工亦农电工小组内，由亦工亦农电工带领他们学习和工作，就地进行培养训练。为了适应亦工亦农管理工作的需要，供电所还改革了有关的规章制度。
    中共祁县委员会对农村电气化事业十分重视，确定一名负责干部统一领导机电部门。在县、社、大队成立了机电管理委员会，通盘安排机电工作，统一步调，加强领导。
    中共祁县委员会最近总结农村用电管理工作经验时认为，实行亦工亦农劳动制度，好处很多。首先，它体现了统一领导、工农结合、互相协作、共同管理的优点。如任村公社，一九六三年架设高压线路，县里有关部门和公社担负建设任务，由供电部门验收，双方互不挂钩。验收时找出了许多毛病，拖了半年才送电。去年这里架设高压线路，情况与过去大不相同。专职电工和亦工亦农电工，在开工前共同选择线路，又共同参加施工，完工后马上送电，前后只用了一个月的时间。再就是实行这种亦工亦农劳动制度，解决了农村电气设备分散和管理集中的矛盾，克服了只使用不维修的缺点。绝大多数亦工亦农电工能够按设备维修制度的要求进行巡视检查，因此，能够及时发现和处理事故，保证正常供电。实行这种制度，还能使建设、运行、使用三者统一起来，共同管电，促进了技术改革。
    这个县的专职电工和亦工亦农电工相配合，兼顾全套设备，相互学习，共同提高，开始出现“一工多艺，一职多能”的新局面。专职电工过去只能承担检修任务，现在是检修、运行、收费、抄表、接电等一套工作都能全部承担下来。
    实行亦工亦农劳动制度以后，祁县供电所负责管理的配电线路和配电变压器比原来增加了将近两倍，专业人员却由原来的二十四人减少到十六人；而各人民公社生产队用电更加便利了。全县的电灌设备在抗旱斗争中发挥了巨大威力。
