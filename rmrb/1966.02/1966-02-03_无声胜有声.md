    Silence Speaks Volumes
    World opinion is strongly condemning the United States' resumption of bombing of North Vietnam. The American and British representatives attending the Seventeen-Nation Disarmament Conference originally thought that the Soviet representative would probably make some sort of statement. However, to their surprise, the Soviet representative Tsarapkin remained "silent" on the matter. As a result, the American and British representatives were both satisfied.
    Not only that, Tsarapkin also explained to reporters: "I have said that the two issues of Vietnam and our (disarmament) negotiations should not be mixed together." What does this mean? It means that no matter how the United States expands its war of aggression against Vietnam, it will not affect the US-Soviet nuclear deal.
    Isn't this Soviet leadership deliberately condoning US imperialism's expansion of the war and the slaughter of the Vietnamese people?

    无声胜有声
    世界各国舆论都在强烈谴责美国恢复对越南北方的轰炸。出席十七国裁军会议的美英代表原以为苏联代表大概总会表表态的。但是，竟出乎他们的意料，苏联代表查拉普金对此“默无一语”。因此，美英代表都感到满意。
    不仅如此，查拉普金还向记者解释说：“我已经说过，越南和我们的（裁军）谈判这两个问题是不应当牵扯在一起的。”这是什么意思呢？那就等于说，不管美国怎样扩大侵越战争，并不影响美苏进行核交易。
    苏联领导这不是有意纵容美帝国主义扩大战争，屠杀越南人民又是什么呢？
