    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 10th – The Korean newspaper *Pyongyang News* published a commentary today pointing out that the recent meeting in Honolulu of U.S. military and political chieftains and heads of the South Vietnamese puppet regime demonstrates that U.S. imperialism is plotting to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, preparing for new adventures.

    The commentary stated that U.S. President Johnson's renewed vociferous cries of "peace" at the meeting are nothing more than a smokescreen to cover up U.S. activities to expand its war of aggression.

    The commentary exposed the shameless lies uttered by Johnson at the meeting, claiming that the U.S. aggression in Vietnam was to "stop aggression." The commentary stated that everyone knows the U.S. invading forces have barged into South Vietnam to seize the entire Vietnam and the entire Indochina region for themselves.

    The commentary concluded that even if Johnson convenes thousands of Honolulu conferences, he will not be able to extricate the U.S. aggressors from their predicament in South Vietnam, nor will he be able to save the South Vietnamese puppets from their doom.

    Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, February 9th – The Algerian News Agency published a commentary on February 9th regarding the meeting in Honolulu between the heads of the United States and South Vietnam, stating that the joint communiqué and the "Honolulu Declaration" issued after the meeting prove that the true intention of the United States is to intensify the Vietnam War.

    The commentary said that after resuming the bombing of North Vietnam, invading a sovereign state, and launching the infamous "peace offensive," the United States has now launched a special offensive in Honolulu.

    The commentary stated, "The statements and talks made in Honolulu are merely a large amount of 'new type of poison gas' released against the American people and the people of other countries."

    朝鲜《平壤新闻》评檀香山会议
    约翰逊叫嚷“和平”掩盖扩大战争
    阿新社斥檀香山宣言是美帝放出的“新型毒气”
    新华社平壤十日电　朝鲜《平壤新闻》十日发表评论指出，美国军政头目和南越伪政权头目最近在檀香山举行的会议表明，美帝国主义正在策划扩大侵越战争，准备进行新的冒险。
    评论说，美国总统约翰逊在会议上再次声嘶力竭地叫嚷“和平”，这只不过是用来掩盖美国扩大侵略战争活动的烟幕。
    评论揭露了约翰逊在会上厚颜无耻地叫嚷的美国在越南的侵略行为是为了“制止侵略”等一派谰言。评论说，谁都知道，美国侵略军闯到越南南方，是为了把整个越南和整个印度支那地区攫为己有。
    评论最后指出，即使约翰逊召集千百次檀香山会议，也无法使美国侵略者摆脱在越南南方的困境，更无法挽救南越傀儡的灭亡。
    新华社阿尔及尔九日电　阿尔及利亚新闻社九日就美国和南越的头目在檀香山开会一事发表评论说，这次会议后发表的联合公报和“檀香山宣言”证明，美国的真正意图是强化越南战争。
    评论说，在恢复轰炸越南北方、侵略主权国家和发动臭名远扬的“和平攻势”之后，美国现在又在檀香山发动了一次特殊的攻势。
    评论说，“在檀香山发表的声明和谈话，只不过是对美国人民和其他国家人民放出的大量‘新型毒气’而已。”
