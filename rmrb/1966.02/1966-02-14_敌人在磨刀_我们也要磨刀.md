    The Tsinghua University Militia Division, by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and taking the People's Liberation Army as an example, has initially formed a militia force with a certain degree of political consciousness, mastery of certain military skills, and relatively solid organization. It was recently awarded a certificate of merit at the Second Beijing Municipal Militia Representatives Conference.
    Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The Tsinghua University Militia Division has organized the militia to study Chairman Mao's works, using Chairman Mao's concept of people's war to arm the militia, achieving remarkable results. Now, the entire university has initially formed a militia force with a certain degree of political consciousness, mastery of certain military skills, and relatively solid organization. At the recently held Second Beijing Municipal Militia Representatives Conference, this militia division received a certificate of merit.
    The Tsinghua University Militia Division was established in 1958 in response to Chairman Mao's call to establish militia divisions on a large scale. Over the past seven years, they have combined militia work with the educational goal of cultivating revolutionary successors who are both red and expert, capable of both literary and military skills, and dedicated to serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers wholeheartedly. Within the militia, they have gradually and deeply carried out the activity of studying Chairman Mao's works, using Chairman Mao's concept of people's war to arm all the militia members. Considering that student militia members have high revolutionary enthusiasm but lack class struggle and war experience, they have focused on conducting class education and education on preparing to deal with an invasion war launched by U.S. imperialism among the militia members. They have systematically organized the militia to study more than 20 articles by Chairman Mao, such as "On Protracted War" and "Strategic Problems in the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War." In the past year or so, in connection with the current situation, leading cadres from relevant departments have given more than 30 reports to the militia on the domestic and international situation and militia work, guiding the militia to learn Chairman Mao's concept of people's war by linking historical experience with the current domestic and international class struggle situation and their own thoughts. They have also adopted activities such as learning from Lei Feng and Wang Jie, learning from the People's Liberation Army, utilizing labor and internships in rural areas and factories, joining the army, holding joint celebrations with the army, and holding exhibitions to promote Chairman Mao's military thought among the militia. Every year, many newly enrolled students, after joining the militia organization, visit buildings near the school that were destroyed by imperialism to denounce the crimes of imperialism. Last year, some militia members went to Datong to join the army and also visited the "Ten Thousand People Pit" of the Datong Coal Mine, which aroused the great hatred of the broad masses of militia members for imperialism and all reactionaries, enhanced their class consciousness, and strengthened their war preparedness concept. Militia member Li Xinshun denounced the crimes of Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in murdering his relatives in class, and resolutely expressed his determination to take over the guns from revolutionary predecessors and become a revolutionary successor capable of both literary and military skills.
    When studying Chairman Mao's works, the Tsinghua University Militia strives to combine study with application, focusing on "application" and putting ideological gains into practical action. In training, with the thought that "the enemy is sharpening their knives, we must sharpen ours too," they bitterly practice skills such as shooting, bayonet fighting, laying landmines, blasting, and first aid, with class hatred and a concept of the enemy's situation. In recent years, nearly 9,000 people have served short-term service and military field training in the army, and more than 25,000 people have conducted live ammunition shooting. They also work hard to practice hard skills on the water. Now 62% of the male militia members in the school can swim more than 100 meters, and the swimming training results of the female militia members are also very great. Last year, more than 90% of the more than 200 first-year female militia members learned to swim, and some can swim more than 1,000 meters. In order to truly enable the broad masses of militia members to be able to come when called, be able to fight when they come, and be able to win in battle, the school's militia sometimes holds combat exercises. Last year, during the Spring Festival, they suddenly received a call from the Armed Forces Department ordering a platoon to assemble at a designated location. From the time the order was issued to the time the team was assembled and fully armed to the designated location one kilometer away, it took only six minutes.
    In daily life, many militia members also take the People's Liberation Army as an example and strictly demand themselves. Many people consciously participate in flood fighting and disaster relief when they go home for vacation, automatically serve passengers on trains, and quietly help classmates do good deeds in dormitories.

    敌人在磨刀　我们也要磨刀
    清华大学民兵师活学活用毛主席著作，以解放军为榜样，初步形成具有一定政治觉悟、掌握一定军事技术、组织比较落实的民兵队伍。最近在北京第二届民兵代表会议上荣获了奖状
    新华社十三日讯　清华大学民兵师，组织民兵大学毛主席著作，用毛主席的人民战争思想武装民兵，取得显著成绩。现在全校已经初步形成了一支具有一定政治觉悟，掌握一定军事技术，组织比较落实的民兵队伍。在最近举行的北京市第二届民兵代表会议上，这个民兵师获得了奖状。
    清华大学民兵师是一九五八年响应毛主席大办民兵师的号召而建立起来的。七年来，他们把民兵工作和培养又红又专、能文能武、全心全意为工农兵服务的革命接班人的教育目的结合起来，在民兵中，逐步深入开展学习毛主席著作活动，用毛主席人民战争思想武装全体民兵。他们根据学生民兵革命热情高，但缺乏阶级斗争和战争锻炼等特点，着重向民兵进行了阶级教育和准备对付美帝国主义发动侵略战争的教育，有计划地组织民兵学习毛主席的《论持久战》、《抗日游击战争的战略问题》等二十多篇文章。最近一年多来，还结合当前形势，请有关部门领导干部分别向民兵作了三十多次国内外形势和民兵工作的报告，引导民兵联系历史经验，联系当前国内外的阶级斗争形势和自己的思想，学习毛主席人民战争的思想。他们还采取学习雷锋、王杰，学习解放军，利用下乡下厂劳动、实习，到部队当兵、同部队联欢、举办展览等活动，向民兵宣传毛主席的军事思想。每年很多新入学的学生，参加了民兵组织后，都到学校附近参观当年遭受帝国主义破坏的建筑，控诉帝国主义罪行。去年一部分民兵去大同当兵，还参观了大同煤矿“万人坑”，激起了广大民兵对帝国主义和一切反动派的旧恨新仇，提高了阶级觉悟，增强了战备观念。民兵李新顺在班上控诉了日本帝国主义和美蒋匪帮杀害自己亲人的罪恶后，坚决表示要接过革命前辈手中的枪，做一个能文能武的革命接班人。
    清华大学民兵在学习毛主席著作时，做到学用结合，在“用”字上狠下功夫，把思想收获落实到实际行动中去。在训练中，他们以敌人在磨刀，我们也要磨刀的思想，带着阶级仇恨和敌情观念，苦练射击、刺杀、埋地雷、爆破、救护等本领。几年来，先后有近九千多人次到部队短期当兵和军事野营，有两万五千多人次举行了实弹射击。他们还苦练水上硬功夫。现在全校男民兵有百分之六十二能游一百米以上，女民兵游泳训练成绩也很大，去年一年级二百多女民兵，有百分之九十以上学会游泳，有的能游千米以上。为了使广大民兵真正做到召之即来，来之能战，战之能胜，这个学校的民兵有时还举行战斗演习。去年春节，他们突然接到武装部电话，命令一个排到指定地点集合，从命令下达到集合队伍，全副武装赶到一公里以外的指定地点，只用了六分钟。
    在日常生活中，许多民兵也以解放军为榜样，严格要求自己。不少人放假回家时，自觉参加抗洪抢险，在火车上自动为旅客服务，在宿舍里悄悄帮助同学做好事。
