　　Finding the Gaps, Catching Up
　　Delegates to the National Grain Bureau Directors Conference and the Grain System Political Work Conference Earnestly Study Jiao Yulu
    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 19th, the delegates attending the National Grain Bureau Directors Conference and the Grain System Political Work Conference in the capital have been earnestly studying the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu in the spirit of rectification. They are universally using Jiao Yulu as a mirror to examine themselves, determined to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way like Jiao Yulu, and further transform their own thinking and work.
    Li Maolin, Director of the Shanxi Provincial Grain Bureau, said that he had been looking for the gaps between himself and Jiao Yulu for two days. It seems that the biggest gap is that he is not as good as Comrade Jiao Yulu in learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. Having been engaged in grain work in Shanxi for more than ten years, although he often went to the countryside, he mostly made superficial visits and seldom stayed at specific locations, and rarely visited the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants. This is a big gap compared with Jiao Yulu, who went deep into the masses as soon as he arrived in Lankao. The fundamental problem is that he has not done enough to transform his thinking by learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way. Li Quanshan, Director and Party Secretary of the Anyang City Grain Bureau in Henan, examined three characters: compared with Jiao Yulu, he did not put enough effort into the word "use" when reading Chairman Mao's books, and not enough "use" in transforming his own thinking. There is still a "me" in his mind, and the word "difficult" comes first in his work. He said that when Comrade Jiao Yulu first arrived in Lankao, he faced many difficulties, but he did not think of difficulties. Why do I always feel that grain work is not easy to do well? We are all Communist Party members, and we have been cultivated by the Party for many years. Why is there such a big gap in thinking? The more I think about it, the more ashamed I feel. Ou Yinzhi, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Tangshan City Grain Bureau in Hebei, said that he was in poor health, and the leaders and comrades advised him to rest, but he had been insisting on working, thinking he was very good. Compared with Jiao Yulu, it is far behind. To transform our thinking by reading Chairman Mao's books, we must take Jiao Yulu as an example and demand ourselves with high standards.
    Many representatives felt deeply pained when comparing themselves with Jiao Yulu for self-examination. Deng Liansheng, Director of the Longchuan County Grain Bureau in Guangdong, Sun Chengxie, Deputy Director of the Linzi County Grain Bureau in Shandong, and Lü Guirong, Deputy Director of the Pianguan County Grain Bureau in Shanxi, all painfully felt that they had not studied Chairman Mao's works enough, that the word "public" was lacking in their thinking, that they lacked the complete and thorough spirit of serving the people like Jiao Yulu, and that they lacked the spirit of "not achieving the goal, not closing their eyes in death" like Jiao Yulu. Wang Changde, Director of the Qimen County Grain Bureau in Anhui, said that he was a demobilized soldier who joined the revolution at the age of eighteen and had always been closely connected with the working people. After becoming the director, he was afraid of climbing mountains and went to the countryside less often, and his feelings for the working people were not as deep as in the past. I want to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, transform myself, improve my work, and be the son of the working people forever like Comrade Jiao Yulu. I will not close my eyes in death if I do not do a good job in grain work.

### 找出差距　迎头赶上　全国粮食厅局长会议和粮食系统政治工作会议的代表认真学习焦裕禄

　　找出差距　迎头赶上
　　全国粮食厅局长会议和粮食系统政治工作会议的代表认真学习焦裕禄
    据新华社十九日讯　在首都出席全国粮食厅局长会议和粮食系统政治工作会议的代表们，用整风精神认真地学习了焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹。他们普遍以焦裕禄作镜子检查自己，决心要象焦裕禄那样活学活用毛泽东思想，进一步改造自己的思想和工作。
    山西省粮食厅厅长栗茂林说，两天来他一直在找同焦裕禄的差距。看起来最大的差距是活学活用毛主席著作不如焦裕禄同志。在山西搞粮食工作十几年，虽然也经常下乡，可是跑面多、蹲点少，很少到贫农下中农家中访问。这同焦裕禄同志一到兰考就深入群众，差距很大。根本问题是活学活用毛主席著作改造思想不够。河南安阳市粮食局长兼党委书记李全山检查了三个字：同焦裕禄比起来他读毛主席的书在“用”字上下功夫不够，“用”于改造自己的思想不够，头脑里还有个“我”字，工作上“难”字当头。他说，焦裕禄同志刚到兰考时困难很多，可是他想到的不是困难。为什么自己老感到粮食工作就不容易做好？一样都是共产党员，都经过党多年培养，为什么思想差距这么大？真是越想越惭愧。河北唐山市粮食局党委副书记欧荫之说，我身体不好，领导上和同志们劝我休息，但我一直坚持工作，自以为很不错了。同焦裕禄一比差得远呢。读毛主席的书改造思想，就要以焦裕禄作榜样，要用高标准要求自己。
    代表们在对比焦裕禄作检查中，感到痛切的人是很多的。广东龙川县粮食局长邓连胜、山东临淄县粮食局副局长孙承燮和山西偏关县粮食局副局长吕贵荣都痛感学习毛主席著作不够，痛感自己思想上“公”字少了，痛感缺少象焦裕禄那样完全、彻底为人民的思想，痛感缺少象焦裕禄那样的“不达目的，死不瞑目”的精神。安徽祁门县粮食局长王长德说，我是转业军人，十八岁就参加革命，一直同劳动人民血肉相连。担任局长以后，怕爬山，下乡少了，同劳动人民的感情也不象过去那么深厚了。我要向焦裕禄同志学习，活学活用毛主席的著作，改造自己，改进工作。象焦裕禄同志那样永远是劳动人民的儿子，不做好粮食工作死不瞑目。
