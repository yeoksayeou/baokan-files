    If the County Party Committee Pays Close Attention, the Afforestation Work Will Be Done Well
    Before 1957, the XinHui County Party Committee did not pay close attention to afforestation, and the effect was very small; later, when they earnestly grasped the afforestation work, the appearance of the mountains and rivers changed greatly in a few years.
    (Our newspaper's report) The XinHui County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Guangdong Province, proceeding from the overall perspective of building a new socialist countryside, while vigorously developing grain and economic crop production, has vigorously grasped afforestation and achieved great results, transforming XinHui County into one of the advanced counties in Guangdong Province for afforestation and greening.
    Tasting the Sweetness of Afforestation
    XinHui County is located in the southwest of the Pearl River Delta. Fertile alluvial plains account for about one-third of the county's land area. Farmers have always focused on managing grain and economic crop production. They also plant fruit trees such as citrus, lychees, and bananas on the plains, making it a well-known land of rice and fish in Guangdong Province, rich in rice, sugarcane, fan palms, fruits, and pond fish; however, about one-third of the county's mountainous areas lack forests and trees. Before liberation, out of the county's 800,000 mu of suitable afforestation land, only 80,000 mu had sparse remnants of forests, and the rest were barren. After liberation, the organization of the masses to plant trees on the mountains began, especially after the agricultural collectivization in 1957. The XinHui County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China earnestly grasped the afforestation work. After eight years of efforts, the appearance of the mountains and rivers was greatly changed. By the end of 1965, the afforestation area in the county had reached more than 520,000 mu, accounting for 63% of the suitable afforestation land. Among them, 330,000 mu were Masson pine, 74,000 mu were bamboo, more than 4,000 mu were Chinese fir, 69,000 mu were miscellaneous trees and protective forests, more than 23,000 mu were lychees, sand pears, and Chinese olives planted on the mountains, and more than 8,000 mu were woody oil materials. Now, many large and small mountains in the county are lush with pine and bamboo; in the plain water network areas, most of the dikes and embankments are planted with economic and timber forests such as bamboo, lychees, taxodium, and Chinese cedar; dozens of large and small market towns and more than 400 kilometers of highways and village roads are shaded by green trees, with flowers and fruits lining the roads. Some communes and brigades that started afforestation earlier and better have already achieved complete self-sufficiency in bamboo and partial self-sufficiency in timber. In some communes and brigades with more severe soil erosion, after planting trees and creating forests, water sources were conserved, the climate was regulated, and grain production developed. Some communes and brigades with few sideline businesses and simple production projects have started selling forest by-products, increasing cash income. The farmers in these places have begun to taste the sweetness of afforestation and say: Planting trees one year earlier means becoming prosperous one year earlier.
    The Key Lies in the County Party Committee's Close Attention
    From the perspective of XinHui County, whether a county's afforestation and greening work is good or not depends on whether the County Party Committee pays close attention. Before 1957, the XinHui County Party Committee also called for afforestation every year, but it had not truly and ideologically clearly recognized the relationship of mutual promotion between agriculture and forestry. In practice, it regarded afforestation as a secondary and incidental task, only managing it during the afforestation season. "Grasping without tightening is equivalent to not grasping." As a result, cadres at all levels did not pay attention to forestry. Except for a very few units with relatively sound organizations for managing forests, most areas only mobilized the masses to climb mountains for a few days during the afforestation season, and after that, very few people managed it. Therefore, trees were planted every year, but no forests were seen. According to statistics, from 1951 to 1956, a total of 560,000 yuan and 200,000 workdays were spent on afforestation in the county, but the effect was very small. The County Party Committee seriously summarized the lessons of the failure of afforestation work, believing that the main reason was that the County Party Committee did not pay enough attention and the leadership was not specific, failing to mobilize the entire Party to do this work; the forestry department did not cultivate key points and do a good job of typical demonstration work; it did not do a good job of greening publicity and education work for the masses, failing to mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for afforestation. The County Party Committee examined the short-sighted and one-sided views in leading production, recognized the harm of this approach, and was determined to correct it. After that, the County Party Committee organized cadres to conduct serious investigations and studies of the county's situation, and formulated a plan to green the entire county in about ten years. Then, at the County People's Congress, cadre meetings, and urban and rural mass meetings, the specific content of this plan was widely publicized, and cadres and masses were educated to green the rivers and mountains for the country, for the collective, for themselves, and for the happiness of future generations. In this way, the call to advance towards barren hills and all suitable afforestation land was sounded throughout the county.
    Giving Play to the Demonstrative Role of Models
    On the basis of unified thinking and understanding, afforestation work was put on the important agenda of the County Party Committee. The County Party Committee assigned a standing committee member to lead the afforestation work, and the County Party Committee concentrated on studying it several times every year. The county and communes carried out production inspection and evaluation activities, and afforestation work was listed as one of the main contents. Since afforestation is both a seasonal and a long-term task, in addition to focusing on grasping a period of time during the key period every year, the professional departments mainly deploy and carry out work according to the plans, guidelines, and policies stipulated by the County Party Committee at other times. In fact, it did not add much burden to the County Party Committee, and there was no major conflict with other work. In recent years, in leading forestry production, the XinHui County Party Committee has mainly focused on cultivating typical examples and using points to lead the whole area. Starting in 1958, the County Party Committee selected Guifeng Mountain, which had ten thousand mu of suitable afforestation barren hills, as a demonstration point for afforestation in the county. The County Party Committee sent a standing committee member to be responsible for leading the afforestation work on Guifeng Mountain. From the County Party Committee Secretary to every County Party Committee member, they all went to the mountain to plant trees, personally experiencing the hardships of cultivating trees and cultivating feelings for forestry. The County Party Committee also organized a large number of cadres, workers, students, and urban residents who were sent to lower levels to participate in the labor of developing Guifeng Mountain. After several years of efforts, Guifeng Mountain has been built into a base for producing timber, fruits, flowers, honey, and livestock. The achievements in developing Guifeng Mountain opened the eyes of the people of XinHui. Under the leadership of the County Party Committee, most of the county's 22 communes had their own afforestation focus and established commune-run forest farms.
    These afforestation focuses managed by the cadres at the county and commune levels in XinHui County not only played a model demonstration role, but also became a base for training technical personnel, testing and introducing tree species, and breeding and supplying seedlings, which played a great role in promoting afforestation work in the county. For example, the LiYue Commune in the plain water network area, according to local characteristics, chose dikes and embankments as the focus of afforestation, planting more than 19,000 economic and timber forests such as lychees and taxodium on the slopes of the 35-kilometer-long dikes and embankments within its territory, and interplanting 200,000 economic crops such as fan palms and bananas, breaking the old rules that no trees or economic crops should be planted on dikes and embankments to avoid affecting the safety of the dikes. Over the past seven years, after several floods, the dikes have never been in danger. The income from fruit trees and economic crops is considerable. From 1959 to 1965, more than 80,000 yuan was turned over to the commune. The commune used this money to repair dikes every year, build small-scale water conservancy projects, and pay for the electricity bills of drainage and irrigation stations, reducing the burden on the production teams. The masses were very satisfied. They said: "Greening the dikes, using the dikes to support the dikes, is a really good method." Many communes and brigades in the county's water network area took LiYue Commune as an example and greened the dikes and embankments. Because there were afforestation focuses at the county and commune levels for demonstration and as bases, the afforestation work in the county developed rapidly from points to areas.
    When Encountering Difficulties and Setbacks
    In the process of leading afforestation and forest management work, the XinHui County Party Committee also encountered many difficulties and setbacks, but they were not discouraged or retreated, and insisted on leading the masses to continue to move forward. Before 1960, the county had successively introduced more than 7 million bamboo seedlings from GuangNing County and distributed them to various places for planting, but most of them did not survive. The masses had many opinions, saying that the county was not suitable for planting bamboo. The County Party Committee was not willing to fail, and together with forestry technicians, analyzed the county's climate and soil conditions, affirming that XinHui County was suitable for planting bamboo. The County Party Committee Secretary at the time, Dang XiangMin, in order to educate cadres and the masses to believe that bamboo planting could be successful in the county, planted a few bamboo trees in front of his door. The Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, Tan XingYue, went to the ShangLing Brigade of the ShuangShui Commune, where bamboo planting had repeatedly failed, to inspect the survival rate of bamboo seedlings, analyze and study with the cadres, and suggested that they visit the NiuWan Commune and the YaXi Commune, which had successfully planted bamboo, and finally helped them find the reasons for the failure of bamboo planting. Now, ShangLing Brigade has 2,300 mu of bamboo growing into forests, with a total income of more than 50,000 yuan in the past three years.
    Adapting to Local Conditions and Striving for Practical Results
    In planting trees and creating forests, XinHui County achieved "planting the right trees at the right time and adapting to local conditions," striving for practical results. What kind of trees to plant in what place was discussed by the masses, and only after scientific research and experiments was it widely promoted. Planting citrus on the mountains was not feasible, so it was changed to lychees. Planting eucalyptus on high mountains did not grow tall, so it was changed to acacia and Chinese fir; planting Chinese fir on low-temperature, short mountains failed, so the Chinese fir was moved to low-temperature, high mountains to plant, and good results were achieved. At the same time, the County Party Committee also conscientiously implemented the policy of "forestry as the main focus, intercropping of agriculture and forestry, combining long-term and short-term, and using short-term to support long-term," so the enthusiasm of the masses for planting trees and creating forests became higher and higher. Since its establishment in 1958, the YaXi Commune Forest Farm has used mountain land to plant peanuts, sugarcane, sweet potatoes, and other short-term crops while creating forests, and has developed sideline production such as beekeeping and raising poultry. Over the past seven years, the income from these short-term productions has been more than 200,000 yuan, solving the source of funds for forest farm construction. With very little investment from the commune, the task of afforestation of more than 12,000 mu was completed. No unit in the county has been affected by afforestation in terms of agricultural production and the lives of the masses.
    Conscientiously Implementing Afforestation Policies
    In leading the county's forestry production, the XinHui County Party Committee conscientiously implemented the policy of people's communes creating forests collectively as the main focus. Within the people's communes, afforestation was carried out simultaneously at the commune, brigade, and production team levels, correctly handling the economic relations of the three levels according to socialist principles, implementing mutually beneficial policies, and fully leveraging the enthusiasm of all levels for afforestation. According to statistics, the area of afforestation by the three levels of people's communes accounts for more than 53% of the county's forested area. In addition, there are six state-run farms and forest farms, afforesting 136,200 mu, accounting for 26% of the county's forested area. The rest are forest farms managed by state organs, enterprises, schools, and urban landscaping departments, and trees planted by commune members in front of and behind their houses.
    The people's commune organizations at all levels adopt a combination of mass shock tactics and professional teams for afforestation. Every year during the afforestation season, the masses are mobilized to carry out shock planting, and the professional teams are responsible for doing a good job in the preparations before afforestation and the management, tending, and harvesting of forest products after afforestation. There are a total of 8,300 afforestation professionals in various communes and production teams in the county, accounting for 3.5% of the total agricultural labor force. The labor force participating in shock planting during the afforestation season accounts for about half of the total agricultural labor force, and the working time is about ten days. It seems that the labor force spent on afforestation and forest management in XinHui County every year is not large, but the wealth created is very large. It is estimated that by 1970, the income from forest products in the county will be approximately more than a quarter of the total grain output in the county in 1965. (Attached pictures)
    Since 1958, PiShan County in XinJiang has cultivated 28 shelterbelts and 440 farmland protection forests with a total length of 86 kilometers. This is the members of the SiDa Brigade of the Satellite Commune continuing to plant trees and transform the Gobi Desert on the edge of the oasis.

    NanHai Commune in the southern coastal area of DianBai County, Guangdong Province, has insisted on afforestation every year since 1956. Now it has initially curbed the harm of wind and sand, and all the abandoned farmland has been restored to cultivation. This is a part of the farmland restored to cultivation by the PaoTai Brigade of the NanHai Commune.

### 县委抓紧了，造林工作就做好了

    县委抓紧了，造林工作就做好了
    新会县委一九五七年以前对造林抓得不紧，效果很小；以后把造林工作认真抓起来，几年时间，山川面貌大大改变。
    本报讯　中共广东省新会县委，从建设社会主义新农村的全面观点出发，在大力发展粮食和经济作物生产的同时，狠抓植树造林，取得了很大的成绩，使新会县一变而为广东省造林绿化的先进县之一。
    尝到了造林的甜头
    新会县位于珠江三角洲西南部，肥沃的冲积平原占全县土地面积的三分之一左右，农民历来都着力于经营粮食和经济作物生产，也在平原上种植柑桔、荔枝、香蕉等果木树，早就成为广东省的一个盛产稻谷、甘蔗、蒲葵、水果、塘鱼的鱼米之乡；而全县约三分之一的山地则缺林少树。解放前，全县八十万亩宜林山地，除八万亩有稀疏的残林外，其余都是光秃秃的。解放后才开始组织群众上山造林，特别是一九五七年农业合作化以后，中共新会县委认真地把造林工作抓起来，经过八年的努力，就大大地改变了山川面貌。到一九六五年止，全县造林面积已达五十二万多亩，占宜林山地的百分之六十三。其中马尾松三十三万亩，竹子七万四千亩，杉四千多亩，杂树和防护林六万九千亩，上山荔枝、沙梨、乌榄等二万三千多亩，木本油材八千多亩。现在，全县许多大小山头松竹并茂；平原水网地区，大部分堤圩植上了竹子、荔枝、水松、苦楝等经济林和用材林；几十个大小墟镇、四百多公里长的公路和村道两旁，绿树成荫、花果夹道。一些造林较早、较好的公社和大队，已经做到竹材全部自给，木材自给一部分。有的水土流失较严重的公社、大队，植树造林以后，涵养了水源，调节了气候，粮食生产发展了。有的副业门路不多、生产项目单一的公社、大队，开始有林副产品出售，增加了现金收入。这些地方的农民，开始尝到了造林的甜头，都说：早一年种树，早一年富裕。
    关键在于县委抓得紧
    从新会县来看，一个县造林绿化工作好不好，关键在于县委是否抓得紧。一九五七年以前，新会县委也年年号召造林，但是还没有真正在思想上明确认识农林互相促进的关系，实际上把造林当作次要的、附带的工作来抓，每逢造林季节才管一管。“抓而不紧，等于不抓”。结果，各级干部也不重视林业，全县除极少数单位有比较健全的经营林木的组织外，大部分地区是在造林季节才发动群众上山突击几天，过后就很少有人管，因而年年种树，年年不见树成林。据统计，从一九五一年到一九五六年，全县造林共用去五六十万元和二十万个工日，而效果很小。县委认真地总结了造林工作失败的教训，认为主要是县委重视不够，领导不具体，没有发动全党来做这项工作；林业部门没有培养重点，做好典型示范工作；没有向群众做好绿化的宣传教育工作，把群众造林的积极性调动起来。县委检查了在领导生产上的急功近利思想和片面观点，认识到这种做法的危害性，决心纠正过来。这以后，县委便组织干部对全县的情况进行了认真的调查研究，制订了十年左右绿化全县的计划。然后，就在全县人民代表大会上、干部会上、城乡群众大会上，广泛宣传这个计划的具体内容，教育干部和群众为国家、为集体、为自己、为子孙后代的幸福，绿化河山。这样，就在全县吹响了向荒山、向一切宜林地进军的号角。
    发挥样板的示范作用
    在统一思想认识的基础上，造林工作提到县委的重要日程上来了。县委分工由一个常委领导造林工作，县委每年都要集中研究几次，县、公社进行生产检查评比活动，把造林工作列为主要内容之一。由于造林既是季节性的又是长期性的工作，所以除了每年在关键时期集中抓一段以外，其它时间主要由专业部门按照县委规定的计划、方针政策来部署和进行工作，事实上并没有增加县委许多负担，没有同其他工作发生很大矛盾。这些年来，新会县委在领导林业生产中，主要是抓了培养典型，以点带面的工作。从一九五八年开始，县委便选择有万亩宜林荒山的圭峰山作为全县造林的示范点。县委派一名常委负责领导圭峰山的造林工作，从县委书记到各个县委委员都上山种过树，亲身体会栽培林木的艰辛，培养对林业的感情。县委又组织了大批下放干部、工人、学生和城镇居民参加开发圭峰山的劳动，经过几年努力，已经把圭峰山建设成为出产木材、水果、花木、蜂蜜、牲畜的基地。开发圭峰山的成就，打开了新会人的眼界。在县委的带动下，全县二十二个公社，绝大多数有自己造林的重点，建立了社办林场。
    新会县县、社两级干部经营的这些造林重点，不但起了样板示范的作用，而且成为训练技术人才，试验介绍树种和繁育供应种苗的基地，对推动全县造林工作起了很大作用。如平原水网地区的礼乐公社，根据当地的特点，选择堤圩搞造林重点，在境内三十五公里长的堤圩斜坡上种荔枝、水松等经济林和用材林一万九千多株，并间种蒲葵、香蕉等经济作物二十万株，打破了过去堤圩上不种树木和经济作物，以免影响堤围安全的陈规。七年多来，几经洪水考验，堤圩从未出过险。果木和经济作物的收入很可观，从一九五九年到一九六五年，上缴给公社八万多元。公社用这笔钱来岁修堤围，建筑小型水利，支付排灌站的电费，减轻了生产队的负担，群众非常满意。他们说：“堤圩绿化，以堤养堤，办法真好。”全县许多水网地区的公社、大队，都以礼乐公社为榜样，把堤圩绿化起来。由于有了县、社两级的造林重点作示范、作基地，因而推动全县的造林工作由点到面地迅速发展了起来。
    遇到困难和挫折的时候
    新会县委在领导造林营林工作的过程中，也遇到过许多困难和挫折，但他们不灰心、不后退，坚持领导群众继续前进。一九六○年以前，全县曾先后从广宁县引进七百多万株竹苗，分给各地种植，大部分没有种活。群众意见很多，说本县不宜种植竹子。县委不甘心失败，同林业技术人员一道研究分析了本县的气候和土壤条件，肯定新会县适宜于种竹子，群众种竹成活率差，是经验不足造成的。当时的县委书记党向民，为了教育干部和群众相信本县种竹可以成功，在自己的门前种了几棵竹。县委副书记谭星越，到了种竹屡次失败的双水公社上凌大队，上山检查竹苗成活率，和干部一起分析研究，并且建议他们到种竹成功的牛湾公社和崖西公社参观访问，终于帮助他们找到了种竹失败的原因。现在，上凌大队已有二千三百多亩竹子长大成林，三年来共收入五万多元。
    因地制宜，讲求实效
    新会县在植树造林中，做到了“适时适树，因地制宜”，讲求实效。什么地方种什么树，都经过群众讨论，经过科学研究和试验，才大量推广。山地上种植柑桔不行，就改种荔枝，高山上种植桉树长不大，就改种相思和杉树；低温、矮山种植杉树失败，就把杉树移到低温的高山下去种，都取得了良好的效果。同时，县委还认真贯彻了“以林为主、农林间作、长短结合，以短养长”的方针，因而群众植树造林的积极性越来越高。崖西公社林场从一九五八年办场以来，在造林的同时，每年都利用山地种植花生、甘蔗、番薯及其他短期作物，并发展养蜂、养家禽等副业生产。七年多来，这些短期生产收入二十余万元，解决了林场建设的资金来源，在公社投资很少的情况下，完成了造林一万二千多亩的任务。全县没有一个单位因造林而影响到农业生产和群众生活。
    认真执行造林政策
    新会县委在领导全县的林业生产上，认真执行了以人民公社集体造林为主的方针。而在人民公社内部，又实行公社、大队、生产队三级一齐造林，按照社会主义原则正确地处理三级经济的关系，贯彻执行互利政策，充分地发挥了各级造林的积极性。据统计，人民公社三级造林的面积，占全县有林面积的百分之五十三强。此外，国营农、林场六个，造林十三万六千二百多亩，占全县有林面积的百分之二十六。其余是国家机关企业单位、学校、城镇园林处经营的林场，和社员个人在屋前屋后种植的树木。
    人民公社各级组织造林，都采取群众性的突击和专业队相结合的办法，每年造林季节发动群众突击植树，专业队则负责做好造林前的准备工作和造林后的管理、抚育和林产品的收获工作。全县各公社、生产队共有造林专业人员八千三百多人，占农业劳动力总数的百分之三点五。造林季节参加突击植树的劳动力，约占农业总劳动力的一半，工作时间十天左右。看来，新会县每年造林营林所花费的劳动力并不多，而创造的财富却很大。据估计，到一九七○年，全县林产品的收入，约等于一九六五年全县粮食总产值的四分之一强。（附图片）
