    Becoming Good
    The office, as an institution, is known as the leader's "eyes and ears." Because for more than a decade, we have continuously called down to the grassroots to understand the situation, resulting in a very "authoritative" set of telephone reports: agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, all are complete; all year round, never interrupted.
    However, these materials are, after all, obtained indirectly, and the figures are inevitably inaccurate, some even false. Therefore, the county party committee often considers "eyes and ears not working" as a disease.
    In the past two years, we have gone deep into the grassroots to grasp first-hand materials, and thus have transformed from "eyes and ears not working" to being a powerful "assistant" to the county party committee.

    From "eyes and ears not working" to becoming a "powerful assistant," this transformation is good, because it is conducive to the revolutionary cause! This transformation, it seems, can also give us enlightenment: What methods should we rely on to carry out leadership work?

    变得好
    办公室这个机构，人们称为领导的“耳目”。因为十几年来，我们不间断地打电话向基层了解情况，有一套十分“权威”的电话报表：农林牧副渔，样样俱全；一年四季，从不间断。
    但是，这些材料毕竟是间接得来的，数字难免不准确，有的甚至虚假。因此，县委常以“耳目不灵”为病。
    这两年，我们深入基层抓第一手材料，于是就由不灵的“耳目”，成为县委得力的“助手”了。

    由“耳目不灵”，变为“得力助手”，这一变，变得好，因为变得有利于革命事业！这一变，想来也可以给我们以启发：究竟应该依靠什么方法来进行领导工作呢？
