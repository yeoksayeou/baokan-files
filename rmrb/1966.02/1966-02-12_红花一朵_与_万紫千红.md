    "A single red flower's" "one" and "myriad purples and reds'" "myriad," "thousand," are a unity of opposites. Countless "ones" compose "myriad thousand," and "myriad thousand" contains countless "ones." If we cannot correctly understand this relationship and only see our own "single red flower," then we will become arrogant and complacent and stagnate. The Three Sisters Film Projection Team of Laishui County, Hebei Province, took a detour on this issue some time ago. After studying Chairman Mao's works, they understood this truth and correctly handled the relationship between "one" and "myriad thousand," and they continued to move forward.
    Our projection team was established in 1958 and has been around for seven years now. There are three people in our team, namely me, Li Jingxian, and Zhang Burong. The masses affectionately call us the "Three Sisters Film Projection Team," and the leadership has officially named us so. The reason why we three girls can become people's film projectionists is precisely the result of the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. As the saying goes: "Rain and dew nourish the seedlings," which is absolutely true. In recent years, we have deeply felt that whenever we put Mao Zedong Thought in our hearts, we make progress; whenever we put Mao Zedong Thought aside, we inevitably regress. If there is any experience we have gained in the past seven years, it is this.
    In the past few years, the leadership has praised us many times, and people have also said, "You are a red flag, a single red flower!" In addition, newspapers and magazines such as the *People's Daily* and the *Guangming Daily* have successively published our articles. At that time, the three sisters were very happy and a little bit elated, feeling that "Our team is really good! Others are singing old tunes, nothing new." Feeling that our "single red flower" is not bad! We were unwilling to learn from the "myriad purples and reds," from other units anymore. Therefore, for a period of time, our work fell behind others. In the whole country, Henan and Hunan caught up; in the whole province, Cangzhou and Tangshan caught up; in the whole special district, Anguo and Anxin also quickly caught up and surpassed our team's level. Seeing this situation, the county leaders promptly instructed us, "Summarize why you are lagging behind fraternal teams? Dig out the root." According to the instructions of the leadership, the three of us sat down and began to summarize. Some said, "The four-lens projector was not fully utilized." Some said, "The quality of the slides is not high." After talking about it, they didn't get to the root. The leadership said: "These can't be considered the main reasons for you, the main reason is that your thinking is not strong enough." This reminded us, so we started to dig out the ideological roots and focused on studying Chairman Mao's "Opening Address at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China." Chairman Mao said: "Even if our work has achieved extremely great results, there is no reason to be arrogant and complacent. Modesty makes one progress, arrogance makes one lag behind, we should always remember this truth." We forgot this truth, no wonder we lagged behind! According to Chairman Mao's teachings, we further analyzed our thoughts and realized that we had "three loves and three unloves": only love to see achievements, not love to find shortcomings; only love to hear praise, not love to hear criticism; only love to see our own advantages, not love to learn from others' strengths. Once the root of the disease was found, we prescribed the right medicine and specifically analyzed the strengths of others. For example, Comrade Han Huimin from Anguo's singing, the main advantage is that the clapper is good, the emotions are full, the enunciation is clear, the rhythm is distinct, and it is neat and crisp, so the opening is impressive. More importantly, Comrade Han Huimin has a good learning spirit. When she was at a meeting in Beijing, others were resting and strolling around, but she went to the folk art venue to learn. After such an analysis, our understanding improved.
    The above facts have taught us that we should divide ourselves into two, and not be self-appreciating, subjective and one-sided. Take us, even if it is a "single red flower", after all, it is only one of the "myriad purples and reds"! We must never cover everything with one thing, replace "myriad" and "thousand" with "one"! Moreover, there will never be no backward aspects in "a single red flower". If you are satisfied, you will not see your own shortcomings, you will be self-righteous and stick to the old ways.
    But let's get back to the point, since "a single red flower" is one of the "myriad thousand", then it should also be a component of the "myriad purples and reds", and should make a contribution to the "myriad purples and reds", but the three sisters and I did not have sufficient awareness of this in the past. For example, when we went to other places for exchange screenings in 1964, we learned the special effects of water ripple fluctuation from Shaanxi Province. After learning it, we put the "sky" and "water" in two lenses according to the characteristics of our team's four-lens projector, overcoming the shortcomings of the sky moving when the water moves. We also added a reflection to the word "static," and the reflection also appeared when the word "static" came out, making the picture more realistic and vivid. After we learned the special effects of "flowering" using three lenses from the "May 1st" Cinema in Shijiazhuang, we tried to make "sunflower blossoming", and also added the special effect of "the sun shining brightly", which was better than the original effect. Such two special effects, three lenses are incapable of, they must be performed with a four-lens projector. And the four-lens projector is only available in our county. We thought: With so many unique tricks, it's really unique, and we don't want to introduce it to others. We are afraid that others will know it, and ours will not be new. At that time, the leaders asked us, "Do you do slides and special effects just to grab the 'top spot'? Is it for competing for merit and rewards?" We studied Chairman Mao's "Must Learn to Do Economic Work" with this question. Chairman Mao pointed out in the article: Labor models should play the role of "leader", "backbone", and "bridge". What role did we play? The leaders also criticized us, saying: "Individualism, fame and fortune viewpoints, and arrogant emotions are all bourgeois thoughts and obstacles to progress. We should always use Mao Zedong Thought to check ourselves." Chairman Mao's works have educated us, and the leaders have helped us, and we are determined to correct these shortcomings in actual work. The Xincheng team wanted to see our "Red Flag Floating" special effects, so we taught them to them. The Jiangsu team came from thousands of miles away to study for half a month, and we not only taught them how to master the skills, but also supported them with some slides and special effects equipment.
    "A single red flower is not spring, myriad purples and reds are spring." Indeed, it is. Through study and practice, our minds have become broader, our understanding has been improved, we have seen the Party's entire film industry, we have seen the entire revolutionary interests, and we have seen the excellent situation of "you chase me and I catch up". Otherwise, "myriad purples and reds" will not come out, and "a single red flower" will not be kept. This has also made us understand a truth: If you want all the flowers to be fragrant, everyone must help.

    “红花一朵”与“万紫千红”
    河北省涞水县三姐妹电影放映队　郑义珍
    “红花一朵”的“一”，和“万紫千红”的“万”、“千”，是对立的统一。无数个“一”组成了“万千”，“万千”中包含了无数个“一”。如果不能正确认识这个关系，光看到自己的“红花一朵”，那就会骄傲自满而停滞不前。三姐妹放映队前些时候在这个问题上走过一段弯路。她们学习了毛主席著作，懂得了这个真理，正确地处理了“一”和“万千”的关系，她们就又继续前进了。
    我们放映队，是一九五八年成立的，到现在，已经有七年的时间了。我们队共三个人，这就是我和李景贤、张步荣。群众亲切地管我们叫“三姐妹放映队”，领导上也正式给我们命了名。我们三个丫头所以能够成为人民的电影放映员，正是毛主席思想哺育的结果。俗话说：“雨露滋润禾苗壮”，这一点也不假。这几年来，我们深深感到：凡是把毛主席思想放在心上的时候，我们就有进步；凡是把毛主席思想放在一边的时候，我们就必然退步。要说七年来我们有什么体会，我们的体会就是这一条。
    这几年，领导上给我们多次表扬，人们也说：“你们是红旗一面，红花一朵！”加上《人民日报》《光明日报》等报章杂志都先后登过我们的文章，那时，我们姐妹三人心里都很高兴，真有点飘飘然起来了，觉得“我们队就是不错！别人唱的尽是老词，没什么新东西”。觉得我们这“红花一朵”就不赖哩！不愿再向“万紫千红”、向别的单位学习了。所以，有一段时间，我们的工作落在别人后边了。在全国，河南、湖南赶上来了；在全省，沧州、唐山赶上来了；在全专区，安国、安新也急追直上，超过了我们队的水平。县领导看见这种情况，就及时指示我们说：“要总结一下：为什么你们落后于兄弟队？要挖一挖根子。”根据领导指示，我们三人开始坐下来进行了总结。有的说：“没有充分发挥四镜头幻灯机的作用。”有的说：“幻灯片质量不高。”说来说去，没有说到根上。领导说：“这些对你们来说，不能算是主要原因，主要原因是思想没过硬。”这下提醒了我们，于是就动手挖思想根子，重点学习了毛主席的《中国共产党第八次全国代表大会开幕词》。毛主席说：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”我们正是忘了这个真理，难怪我们要落后！照着毛主席的教导，进一步分析了我们的思想，认识到我们有“三爱三不爱”：只爱看成绩，不爱找缺点；只爱听表扬，不爱听批评；只爱看自己的优点，不爱学别人的长处。病根找到了，我们就对症下药，具体分析了别人的长处。如安国韩慧敏同志的演唱，主要优点是快板打得好，感情充沛，吐字清楚，节奏鲜明，干脆利落，所以开板就压场。更重要的是韩慧敏同志的学习精神好，在北京开会时，别人休息逛大街，她却到曲艺场去学艺。经过这样一分析，我们的认识提高了。
    以上事实教育我们，对自己要一分为二，不要自我欣赏，主观片面。拿我们来说，就算是“红花一朵”吧，可是，也总归是“万紫千红”中之一朵呀！决不能以一盖全、以“一”代替“万”“千”哪！再说“红花一朵”里也决不会没有落后方面。要是满足了，就会看不见自己的缺点，就会自以为是，故步自封。
    话还得说回来，“红花一朵”，既然是“万”、“千”中之一朵，那么它也就是“万紫千红”的组成部分，也就应该对“万紫千红”有所贡献，可是我们姐妹三人对这一点过去认识不足。譬如一九六四年去外地交流映出时，我们学到了陕西省的水纹波动的特技。学到以后，又根据我们队四镜头幻灯机的特点，把“天”和“水”分放在两个镜头里，克服了水动天也动的缺点。我们又把“静”字加上倒影，在出“静”字的同时倒影也随着出现，使画面显得更加真实生动。在我们学到了石家庄“五一”电影院用三镜头表现“开花”的特技后，就试制了“向日葵开花”，另外还加上“太阳放光芒”的特技，比原来的效果好。这样两种特技，三镜头是无能为力的，非用四镜头幻灯机表演不可。而四镜头幻灯机，只我们县里有。我们想：这样绝招多了，真是独份，不想介绍出去。怕别人都会了，我们的就不新鲜了。当时，领导问我们，“你们搞幻灯，搞特技，只是为了把‘尖子’抢到吗？是为了争功论赏吗？”我们带着这个问题学习了毛主席的《必须学会做经济工作》一文。毛主席在文章里指出：劳动模范应该起“带头作用”、“骨干作用”、“桥梁作用”。可我们这算起了什么作用呀？领导上也批评我们说：“个人主义，名利观点，骄傲情绪，这些都是资产阶级的思想，是进步的障碍。应该时时用毛泽东思想来检查自己。”毛主席著作教育了我们，领导帮助了我们，我们决心在实际工作中改正这些毛病。新城队要看我们的“红旗飘”特技，我们就教给了他们。江苏队千里迢迢来学习了半个月，我们不仅教给他们掌握技巧，还支援了他们一些幻灯片和特技设备。
      “红花一朵不是春，万紫千红才是春”。的确这样。通过学习，实践，使我们的心胸更宽广了，认识更提高了，看到了党的整个电影事业，看到了整个革命利益，看到了“你追我赶”的大好形势。要不，“万紫千红”出不来，“红花一朵”也保不住。这又使我们懂得了一个道理：若要万花香，必须大家帮。
