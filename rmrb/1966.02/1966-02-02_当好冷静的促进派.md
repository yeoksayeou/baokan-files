    Currently, on China's industrial and transportation front, there is a widespread movement to learn from Daqing, catch up with Daqing, and surpass Daqing, extensively carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. All sectors, all regions, and all units are focusing on key areas and striving to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced production technology levels. A new high tide of production and construction is continuing to develop.
    This excellent situation is developing on the basis of the unprecedented bumper harvest achieved by the industrial and transportation front last year. We are following the path of running industry according to Mao Zedong Thought, and this path is becoming wider and wider. Practice shows that Mao Zedong Thought can not only solve China's revolution problems, but also solve the problem of China's industrialization path. This year, our task is to advance victoriously and greatly improve the level of industrial production.
    Now, in many places and many enterprises, after the Socialist Education Movement, after studying Chairman Mao's works, after learning from the People's Liberation Army and Daqing, and after discussing the situation and tasks at length, the revolutionary drive of the broad masses is fully mobilized. It can be said that wherever the leadership points, the broad masses can fight. Under such circumstances, the leaders of enterprises, in particular, need to be good, calm promoters, with both enthusiasm and cool-headedness.
    A revolutionary, a leader, must always be a promoter of the socialist revolution and construction. This is a matter of principle, a question of whether or not to make revolution. How can we be good promoters? Not only must we fully mobilize the masses, arouse the enthusiasm of the broad masses, and boost their energy, but also promote the spirit of seeking truth and adhere to a serious, militant, scientific attitude. This is a question of acting in accordance with objective laws and guiding practice with Marxist-Leninist epistemology.
    Revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude, enthusiasm and cool-headedness, are a unity. Lacking either aspect will prevent people from achieving their intended goals. In the current new high tide of increasing production and practicing economy, what issues should we pay attention to in order to be good, calm promoters?
    We must adhere to quality first. This is a major issue of principle. When a mass production high tide arrives, leaders should pay close attention and avoid unilaterally pursuing quantity. Instead, they should emphasize quality first, striving for more, faster, and more economical production with good quality. This is a matter of comprehensively implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction. To be good, calm promoters, we must unswervingly adhere to quality first.
    We must pay attention to the combination of work and rest. Some comrades believe that not engaging in overtime and shock work is not a lively and revolutionary manner. This is a wrong and harmful view. We cannot pursue formalistic enthusiasm. The practice of overtime and intensifying labor cannot make the movement last. Leaders should guide the revolutionary drive of the masses in the right direction, do everything possible to tap potential, grasp the main key to improving production, mobilize the masses, and launch technological innovation and technological revolution.
    We must ensure safe production. People are the most valuable factor in production. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, regardless of what measures are taken, what technological innovations are implemented, or what systems are reformed, we must strictly abide by the principles of safe production. This is a fundamental principle of our socialist enterprise management.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "What we need is a warm but calm mood, tense but orderly work." We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions in leading the campaign to increase production and practice economy.
    Mao Zedong Thought is a combination of high revolutionary spirit and high scientific spirit. As long as we truly study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, we will definitely be able to be good, calm promoters, making our movement to increase production and practice economy this year even more vigorous, solid, and fruitful than last year, so that we can create greater and better achievements in the struggle to catch up with and surpass international advanced production technology levels!

### 当好冷静的促进派

    当好冷静的促进派
    当前我国工业交通战线上，正在普遍学大庆，赶大庆，超大庆，广泛开展增产节约运动；各行各业，各个地方，各个单位，都在有重点、有目标地努力争取赶上和超过世界上先进的生产技术水平。一个生产建设新高潮，正在继续发展中。
    这个大好形势，是在去年工业交通战线取得空前大丰收的基础上发展的。我们按照毛泽东思想办工业的路子越走越宽。实践表明，毛泽东思想不仅能解决我国的革命问题，同样能解决我国工业化的道路问题。今年，我们的任务是乘胜前进，把工业生产水平大大提高一步。
    现在许多地方、许多企业，经过社会主义教育运动，经过大学毛主席著作，经过大学解放军、大学大庆，经过大议形势、大谈任务，广大群众的革命干劲鼓得足足的，可以说是领导指到那里，广大群众就能打到那里。在这种情况下，企业的领导者，特别需要当好冷静的促进派，要热中有冷，冷热结合。
    一个革命者，一个领导者，任何时候都要当社会主义革命和建设事业的促进派。这是一个立场问题，是一个要不要革命的问题。怎样才能当好促进派？不但要充分发动群众，调动广大群众的积极性，鼓足干劲；并且要发扬求实精神，坚持严肃的战斗的科学态度。这是一个按照客观规律办事，用马克思列宁主义认识论指导实践的问题。
    革命精神和科学态度，热和冷，是一个统一体，缺少那一个方面，都会使人们达不到预期的目标。在当前的增产节约的新高潮中，我们要当好冷静的促进派，主要应当注意那些问题呢？
    一定要坚持好字当头，质量第一。这是一个重大的原则性问题。在群众性生产高潮到来的时候，领导者要十分注意，不要片面追求数量，而是要强调好字当头，好中求多，好中求快，好中求省。这是一个全面贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线的问题。我们要当好冷静的促进派，就必须坚定不移地做到好字当头。
    一定要注意劳逸结合。有些同志，以为不搞加班加点，不搞突击，就不象个轰轰烈烈的革命样子。这是一种错误的、有害的看法。我们不能追求形式上的轰轰烈烈，那种加班加点，加强劳动强度的做法，决不可能使运动持久。领导者要把群众的革命干劲引导到正确的方向上去，千方百计地挖掘潜力，抓住提高生产的主要关键，发动群众，展开技术革新和技术革命。
    一定要保证安全生产。人是生产中最宝贵的因素。在增产节约运动中，不论采取什么措施，不论实行什么技术革新，不论改革什么制度，都要严格遵守安全生产的原则。这是我们社会主义企业经营管理的一条根本原则。
    毛泽东同志说：“我们需要的是热烈而镇定的情绪，紧张而有秩序的工作。”我们领导增产节约运动，必须按照毛主席的这个指示办事。
    毛泽东思想是高度的革命性和高度的科学性的结合。我们只要真正活学活用毛泽东思想，就一定能当好冷静的促进派，使我们今年的增产节约运动，更加轰轰烈烈，扎扎实实，取得比去年更大更好的收获，使我们在赶超国际先进的生产技术水平的斗争中，创造更大更好成绩！
