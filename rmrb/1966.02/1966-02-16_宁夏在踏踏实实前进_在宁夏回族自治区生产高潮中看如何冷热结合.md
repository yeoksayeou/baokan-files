    In January of this year, we visited the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Whether in the Yellow River irrigation area with its crisscrossing canals, the arid areas swept by sandstorms, or the humid areas at the foot of the Liupan Mountains, we saw a bustling scene and heard lively discussions everywhere. The entire region is in a situation of great change and great development. Here, the policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production" is very effective. The entire region has achieved consecutive bumper harvests for three years, with both grain production and animal husbandry production greatly exceeding historical highs. The responsible comrades of the Autonomous Region Party Committee said that Ningxia's production level is still relatively low, and cultivation is relatively rough. Compared with some advanced regions, the gap is still quite large. We must continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses to the greatest extent, seize every minute and every second, work hard and practically, and raise agricultural production to a new level.

    We visited some counties and communes in the Autonomous Region, and everywhere we saw the broad masses working tirelessly, braving the severe cold, starting early and working late, accumulating and delivering fertilizer, and actively preparing for plowing, creating a fiery atmosphere. Under the excellent situation, leading comrades at all levels, following the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, maintained a clear head, went deep into the grassroots, relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants, listened to various opinions among the masses, and through analysis and synthesis, supported the good, promoted the correct, and mobilized the revolutionary initiative of the masses to the sharpest edge that could develop production. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses was protected and brought into play to the greatest extent, making the transformation of Ningxia's face a conscious action of the Ningxia masses.

    Combining Coolness and Enthusiasm to Maintain the Enthusiasm of the Masses

    It is normal for problems to arise in work. As long as coolness and enthusiasm are combined, experiences are summarized in time, and problems are solved in time, the enthusiasm of the masses can be maintained and promoted, and the masses can be led forward better.

    In Wu Zhong County, a well-known area in the Yellow River irrigation area, we saw thousands of Mao ditches, bucket ditches, branch ditches, and dry ditches alongside the ancient Qin and Han canals dug two thousand years ago, as well as neat garden fields stretching to the horizon.

    In the past, the fragmented canals historically left behind here, due to the lack of coordinated drainage and irrigation, caused more than half of the county's 180,000 mu of irrigated land to suffer from varying degrees of salinization. In recent years, the Wu Zhong County Party Committee summarized and promoted the advanced experience of the Gu Cheng Brigade in the county in digging drainage ditches, lowering the groundwater level, leveling the land, and implementing garden farming. In particular, in 1964, it led the masses to launch a high tide of large-scale farmland capital construction, digging a large number of drainage ditches and building tens of thousands of mu of garden fields, greatly alleviating the degree of salinization, and achieving significant increases in production that year. However, due to insufficient unified planning, some projects could not be coordinated, and some projects had to be reworked.

    Faced with this situation, what should be done? Some people advocated immediately summarizing experience, affirming achievements, overcoming shortcomings, and continuing to guide the masses forward. Some people were satisfied with the achievements already made, did not pay attention to the problems that arose in the work, and believed that raising these problems would pour cold water on the masses. What should be done?

    The Wu Zhong County Party Committee adopted the first attitude, and conducted timely inspection and summary. They studied Chairman Mao's relevant works and instructions with these problems in mind. After a cool analysis, they believed that repairing drainage ditches was definitely right, and it was normal for problems to arise in the work. If one only felt cold and not enthusiastic when encountering problems, it would dampen the enthusiasm of the masses. But if one only felt enthusiastic and not cold, ignoring the contradictions that had already arisen in the actual work and continuing to do so would waste manpower and resources, and would also dampen the enthusiasm of the masses. Coolness and enthusiasm must be combined, and leaders must work with the masses to seek ways to resolve contradictions. This was precisely to promote the completion of drainage projects, protect and promote the enthusiasm of the masses, and move forward better.

    After reaching a unified understanding, the Wu Zhong County Party Committee sent cadres deep into the grassroots, adopting the method of combining leaders, technicians, and the masses, and further formulated and revised the garden farming plans at the county, commune, and brigade levels. In the process of formulating the plan, they educated cadres and the masses to consider both the interests of their own commune and brigade and the interests of the whole, and to connect the interests of the commune and brigade with the interests of the whole. In this way, the awareness of the masses in the county was raised, and they had a unified plan and reliable methods, so the water conservancy projects were built quickly and well. In 1965, the original plan was to build 50,000 mu of garden fields, but 85,000 mu were built. Together with the 16,000 mu built before 1964, 60 percent of the county's cultivated land had unobstructed drainage and irrigation, and small-plot cultivation was achieved. In that year, the county's grain yield per mu had already "crossed the Yellow River" and approached the "Huai River."

    From this incident, we can see the extreme importance of being a calm promoter. In any work, there must be coolness in enthusiasm and enthusiasm in coolness. Only in this way can we truly and effectively maintain the enthusiasm of the masses and protect the enthusiasm of the masses, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses to the most effective way of developing production.

    Overcoming Negative Factors by Promoting Positive Factors

    To promote the healthy development of a mass production upsurge, it is first necessary to affirm the positive factors and continue to bring into play the subjective initiative of the masses; at the same time, it is necessary to guide the masses with full enthusiasm to overcome negative factors.

    In the Yellow River irrigation area of the Autonomous Region, wherever you go, you can see piles of soil fertilizer stacked on the newly turned land, like undulating hills. The masses have paid arduous labor to strive for this year's bumper harvest. In Yong Ning County, one of the Autonomous Region's concentrated grain producing areas, the preparation for plowing work is even more outstanding. After the socialist education movement, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members have undergone a new change in their mental outlook, are high-spirited, full of fighting spirit, and have launched a high tide of preparation for plowing production centered on accumulating and delivering fertilizer. From here and from some other counties and communes, we learned about a very meaningful debate on accumulating and making fertilizer.

    The soil fertilizers here include kang soil fertilizer, circle soil fertilizer, and house soil fertilizer, etc. These are fertilizers accumulated by the masses in accordance with local conditions, which account for a considerable proportion of farmyard manure. However, these soil fertilizers have a large proportion of loess, and the fertilizer efficiency is not high, resulting in a "loess moving" situation. Transporting this soil fertilizer takes up a lot of labor, reaching 30 to 40 percent in high cases. There is no doubt that the masses are willing to spend so much effort to make and transport soil fertilizer, which is precisely a manifestation of their revolutionary spirit of daring to change the world. However, if too much labor is used in this area, the labor available in other areas will inevitably be reduced, which is not conducive to the development of agricultural production. And the farming technology in this area is relatively rough and requires a lot of labor for intensive cultivation. This is a contradiction, and the contradiction is even more prominent in the production upsurge.

    How should this problem be solved? One view is that this is a traditional habit of the masses and cannot be changed. Another view is that this method of accumulating fertilizer is too wasteful of labor, and the life of "loess moving" must be revolutionarily changed, and soil fertilizer should no longer be accumulated. Of course, both of these views are incorrect and cannot solve the problem. In the high tide of any mass movement, such and such problems will arise. A Marxist-Leninist should first see the enthusiasm of the masses and, in the process of bringing into play the enthusiasm of the masses and raising the awareness of the masses, educate the masses to overcome negative factors. This is exactly what the Ningxia Autonomous Region Party Committee did.

    When a responsible comrade of the Autonomous Region Party Committee was squatting in a brigade in Yong Ning County, he raised this question to the masses for advice, and worked with the masses to carry soil to make fertilizer and study ways to solve the problem. He guided the masses to look at the actual results, calculated detailed accounts of gains and losses with the masses, and patiently educated the masses to understand this principle: Without a certain quantity, there is no quality; but if we do not pay attention to quality, the more quantity, the greater the waste, which is extremely detrimental to production. While affirming the traditional method of accumulating fertilizer, this responsible comrade guided the masses to look forward, paying attention to improving the quality of soil fertilizer and gradually changing the "loess moving" situation, and opening up more sources of fertilizer, putting more effort into trial planting green manure, raising pigs, raising sheep, and breeding livestock. Grasping the positive factors and arranging labor appropriately, the masses had a clear direction and greatly increased their enthusiasm. Not only was the quality of soil fertilizer improved, but other fertilizers also increased.

    The comrades in Ningxia believe that to promote the healthy development of a new high tide of mass production, it is first necessary to affirm the positive factors. Grasping the positive factors is the only way to better bring into play the subjective initiative of the masses. Of course, attention must be paid to negative factors; but we must enthusiastically help the masses to find ways and find a way out. Otherwise, it will dampen the enthusiasm of the masses.

    Proceeding from Reality in Everything, Striving for Practical Results in Everything

    Starting from reality, considering both needs and possibilities; considering both long-term interests and increasing production in the current year; combining soaring revolutionary vigor with a scientific and realistic attitude, will achieve great practical results.

    The potential of the mountainous areas of Ningxia is great, and there is much to be done. To achieve great things, we must proceed from reality, combine soaring revolutionary vigor with a scientific and realistic attitude, and strive for practical results in everything. The practice of building terraced fields in the Gu Yuan area embodies this spirit. Gu Yuan County built 500,000 mu of simple terraced fields last year. Together with the past, there are 910,000 mu, accounting for more than a quarter of the county's cultivated land area. These simple terraced fields were built and took effect in the same year. Last year, this county had the largest production increase in the entire special zone.

    Are they only satisfied with simple terraced fields and not building level terraced fields? No. In the Ba Li Pu Brigade of the Cheng Guan Commune in Long De County, a comrade led us to see the terraced fields on a mountain more than 200 meters high. This mountain may have originally been an inconspicuous earth mountain, but it is now surrounded by layers of terraced fields. When we reached the top of the mountain, we could see mountains connected to mountains and fields connected to fields. The entire mountainous area looked like a beautiful brocade. This comrade pointed out the shortcomings of each terraced field, saying that this piece of land was not flat enough and that the ridges of that piece of land were not up to standard. This shows that they are not satisfied with simple terraced fields, and as long as there is a possibility, they will turn simple terraced fields into level terraced fields. In fact, among the simple terraced fields on this mountain that we saw, there were many level terraced fields. In the long-term plan formulated in the Gu Yuan area last year, it was proposed to strive to turn many simple terraced fields into high-standard level terraced fields within two or three years. A deputy county magistrate in Gu Yuan County said that within three years, 80 percent of the land in the county suitable for level terraced fields will be built into simple terraced fields, and efforts will be made to build all of them into level terraced fields in five years, and production can be doubled. They are determined to move from easy to difficult, from low to high, until the mountainous areas are completely changed.

    Comrades in the Gu Yuan area believe that building terraced fields is a very important measure to control soil erosion and develop agricultural production in mountainous areas. However, whether to build level terraced fields or simple terraced fields, we must proceed from reality, considering both needs and possibilities, and considering both long-term interests and increasing production in the current year. If conditions are available to build level terraced fields, we should actively build them; if conditions are not available, we should build simple terraced fields first. If we try to build level terraced fields reluctantly, it will take up too much manpower, affect production in the current year, and dampen the enthusiasm of the masses. It is wrong to be satisfied with low standards and lack ambition; it is also wrong to be divorced from reality and greedy for big things and high things. Because being divorced from reality will inevitably make it impossible to achieve. Only by proceeding from reality can we achieve practical results.

    宁夏在踏踏实实前进
    ——在宁夏回族自治区生产高潮中看如何冷热结合
    今年一月，我们访问了宁夏回族自治区，不论在渠道纵横的黄河灌区、风沙弥漫的干早地区，还是六盘山麓的阴湿地区，到处看到热气腾腾，听到议论纷纷。全区正处在一个大变革、大发展的形势之中。在这里，抓革命促生产的方针很见效，全区连续三年获得丰收，粮食生产和畜牧业生产都大大超过了历史最高水平。自治区党委负责同志说，目前宁夏的生产水平仍然比较低，耕作比较粗糙，跟一些先进地区比，差距还比较大。我们必须继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬不断革命精神，最大限度地调动群众的积极性，争分夺秒，苦干实干，把农业生产提高到一个新的水平。
    我们访问了自治区的一些县和公社，到处看到广大群众不畏严寒，起早贪黑，积肥送肥，积极备耕，搞得热火朝天。在大好形势下，各级领导同志，遵从毛泽东同志的教导，保持清醒头脑，深入基层，依靠贫下中农，倾听群众中各式各样的意见，经过分析综合，支持好的，发扬正确的，把群众的革命能动性，调动到最能发展生产的刀刃上去。这样，就最大限度地保护和发挥了群众的积极性，使改变宁夏面貌成为宁夏群众自觉的行动。
    冷热结合才能保持群众的积极性
    工作中出点问题，本是正常现象。只要冷热结合，及时总结经验，及时解决问题，就能保持和发扬群众的积极性，更好地领导群众前进。
    我们在黄河灌区有名的吴忠县，看到同二千年前挖的古老渠道秦渠、汉渠并列的，是新挖的千百条毛沟、斗沟、支沟和干沟，是一畦畦整整齐齐的园田，一直延伸到天边。
    过去，这里历史上遗留下来的支离破碎的渠道，由于排灌不配套，曾经使全县十八万亩水浇地，有一半以上出现了不同程度的盐碱化的现象。几年来，吴忠县委总结和推广了本县古城大队开挖排水沟、降低地下水位、平整土地、实行园田化的先进经验；特别是一九六四年，又领导群众掀起了一个大搞农田基本建设的高潮，开挖了大量排水沟，修建了上万亩园田，大大减轻了盐碱化的程度，当年收到了显著的增产效果。但是由于统一规划不够，有的工程不能配套，有的工程还要返工。
    面对这种情况，怎么办？有人主张立即总结经验，肯定成绩，克服缺点，继续引导群众前进。有人满足于已经取得的成绩，不重视工作中出现的问题，认为提出这些问题，会给群众泼冷水。究竟应该怎么办？
    吴忠县委采取了第一种态度，及时进行检查总结。他们带着这些问题，学习了毛主席有关著作和指示。经过冷静的分析，认为修排水沟肯定是对的，工作中出点问题，这是正常的现象。如果碰到问题就只冷不热，会挫伤群众的积极性。但是如果只热不冷，对实际工作中已经产生的矛盾，置之不理，继续干下去，就会浪费人力、物力，同样会挫伤群众的积极性。冷热一定要结合，领导一定要和群众一起寻求解决矛盾的途径。这正是为了促进排水工程的完成，保护和发扬群众的积极性，更好地前进。
    吴忠县委在统一认识以后，派出干部，深入基层，采取领导、技术人员、群众三结合的办法，进一步制订和修订了县、公社、大队三级的园田化规划。在制订规划的过程中，教育干部和群众，既考虑本社队的利益，又考虑整体的利益，把社、队的利益同整体的利益衔接起来。这样，全县群众觉悟提高了，又有了统一规划和可靠的办法，水利工程就修得又快又好。一九六五年，原计划修园田五万亩，结果修了八万五千亩。加上一九六四年以前修的一万六千亩，全县有百分之六十的耕地排灌畅通，做到了小畦耕作。这一年，全县的粮食亩产量已经“跨黄河”而接近“淮河”。
    从这件事中，可以看到当冷静的促进派的极端重要性，做任何工作，必须热中有冷，冷中有热。这样才能真正有效地保持群众的热情和保护群众的积极性，把群众的积极性调动到发展生产最有效的途径上。
    从发扬积极因素中克服消极因素
    要促进群众性生产高潮健康地发展，首先要肯定积极因素，继续发挥群众的主观能动性；同时要满腔热情地引导群众克服消极因素。
    在自治区黄河灌区，不管走到那里，都能看到新翻的土地上堆积着一堆堆的土肥，好象起伏的山岗。群众对争取今年的丰收，付出了艰巨的劳动。在自治区粮食集中产区之一的永宁县，备耕工作做得更加突出。经过社会主义教育运动，广大贫农下中农和社员群众，精神面貌焕然一新，意气风发，斗志昂扬，掀起了一个以积肥送肥为中心的备耕生产高潮。从这里和从别的一些县、社，我们了解到对积肥造肥一个很有意义的争论。
    这里的土肥，有炕土肥、圈土肥和房土肥等。这是群众因地制宜积攒的肥料，在农家肥中占有相当大的比重。但是这种土肥中黄土成分大，肥效不高，存在着“黄土搬家”的情况。运送这种土肥占用劳动力很多，高的达到百分之三十到四十。群众愿意花这么大的力量造土肥送土肥，毫无疑问，这正是他们敢于改天换地的革命精神的表现。但是，这方面占用的劳力多了，其他方面能用的劳力必然减少，对于发展农业生产是不利的。而这个地区耕作技术比较粗糙，需要很多的劳力实行精耕细作。这是一个矛盾，在生产高潮中矛盾就更为突出。
    这个问题应当怎样解决呢？一种意见认为，这是群众传统习惯，无法改变。一种意见认为，这种积肥方法太浪费劳动力，必须革掉“黄土搬家”的命，不再积造土肥。这两种意见当然都是不对的，都是解决不了问题的。在任何群众运动的高潮中，都会出现这样那样的问题。一个马克思列宁主义者，首先要看到群众的积极性，在发挥群众积极性、提高群众觉悟的过程中，教育群众克服消极因素。宁夏自治区党委正是这样做的。
    自治区党委一位负责同志在永宁县一个大队蹲点的时候，提出这个问题向群众请教，同群众一起背土造肥，研究解决问题的办法。他引导群众看实际效果，同群众算得失的细账，耐心地教育群众懂得这个道理：没有一定的数量就没有质量；但是如果不讲质量，数量越多，浪费就越大，对生产极为不利。这位负责同志在肯定传统积肥办法的同时，引导群众向前看，既要注意提高土肥质量，逐步改变“黄土搬家”的情况；又要广开肥源，把更多的力量放在试种绿肥、养猪、养羊、繁殖牲畜方面。抓住积极因素，适当安排劳力，群众方向明确，干劲大增。不仅土肥质量提高了，其他肥料也增加了。
    宁夏同志认为，要促进群众性的生产新高潮健康地向前发展，首先要肯定积极因素。抓住了积极因素，才能更好地发挥群众的主观能动作用。当然必须注意到消极因素；但是要满腔热情地帮助群众想办法，找出路。否则，就会挫伤群众的积极性。
    一切从实际出发  一切务求实效
    从实际出发，既要考虑需要，又要考虑可能；既要考虑长远利益，又要考虑当年增产，把冲天的革命干劲同科学的求实态度结合起来，就会大收实效。
    宁夏山区潜力很大，大有可为。要大有作为，必须从实际出发，把冲天的革命干劲和科学的求实态度结合起来，一切务求实效。固原地区修梯田的做法，体现了这种精神。固原县去年修成了五十万亩简易梯田，连过去的算在一起，共有九十一万亩，占全县耕地面积四分之一以上。这些简易梯田，当年修成，当年收效。这个县去年是全专区增产最多的。
    他们是不是只满足于简易梯田，而不搞水平梯田呢？不是。在隆德县城关公社八里铺大队，一位同志领我们到二百多米高的山上看梯田。这座山，原来也许是很不显眼的土山，现在被一层层梯田环绕着。到了山顶，展眼一望，山连山，田连田，整个山区好象一幅美丽的织锦。这位同志对逐块梯田指出缺点，说这块地还不够平，那块地埂还不合格。这说明他们并不满意简易梯田，只要一有可能，就要使简易梯田变成水平梯田。其实，在我们看到这座山上的简易梯田中，就有许多水平梯田。固原地区在去年制订的长远规划中提出，争取在两三年内，把许多简易梯田变成高标准的水平梯田。固原县一位副县长说，要在三年内把全县适合搞水平梯田的土地，百分之八十修成简易梯田，力争五年全部修成水平梯田，产量可以成倍提高。他们决心从易到难，从低到高，一直到彻底改变山区面貌。
    固原地区的同志认为，修建梯田，是控制水土流失，发展山区农业生产的一项非常重要的措施。但是，究竟是修建水平梯田，还是修建简易梯田，要从实际出发，既要考虑需要，又要考虑可能，既要考虑长远利益，又要考虑当年增产。有条件搞水平梯田的，应当积极修建；条件不具备的，就先搞简易梯田。如果勉强去搞水平梯田，就会过多地占用人力，影响当年生产，挫伤群众积极性。满足低标准，缺乏雄心壮志是不对的；脱离实际，贪大图高，也是不对的。因为脱离实际，必不可能办到。只有从实际出发，才能收到实效。
