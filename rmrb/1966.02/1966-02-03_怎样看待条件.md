    Some comrades say, "To carry out teaching reform, we should give way to the old schools and old teachers with better conditions, because they have more experience, a better foundation, and complete equipment." The implication is that new schools established not long ago and new teachers who have not worked for long can hardly achieve anything in teaching reform.

    *Wenhui Bao* published a short commentary stating: Favorable conditions and unfavorable conditions are always relative, not absolute. There is no such thing as only favorable conditions and no unfavorable conditions; there is also no such thing as only unfavorable conditions and no favorable conditions. The two are constantly developing and transforming each other in the midst of contradictory struggles. Some old schools and old teachers, to some extent, may have a better foundation and more experience, but this only reflects one aspect of the matter; on the other hand, they are also easily bound by more old frameworks, so it will be more difficult for them to break away from the original rut, and the resistance will be greater. Compared with those new schools and new teachers, although there are unfavorable aspects, they have fewer frameworks and fewer constraints, which is conducive to the revolution of breaking the old and establishing the new. This is the greatest favorable condition. It can be seen that the key to doing a good job in teaching reform does not lie in the objective conditions, but in the mental state of the people carrying out teaching reform.

    Indeed, the conditions of each unit are not exactly the same, the foundations are not without differences, and there will inevitably be difficulties in the process of advancement. However, the responsibility of a revolutionary is to strive to create favorable conditions and actively promote the transformation of unfavorable conditions in a favorable direction, so that the teaching reform work can progress more effectively.

### 怎样看待条件

    怎样看待条件
    有的同志说：“搞教学改革，还得让位给条件好的老学校、老教师，因为他们那里经验多，基础好，设备全。”等等。言下之意，那些创办不久的新学校，工作不久的新教师，在教学改革中很难有什么作为。
    《文汇报》发表短评说：有利条件与不利条件，总是相对的，不是绝对的。只有有利条件，不存在不利条件的事情是没有的；只有不利条件，不存在有利条件的事情也是没有的。而两者又总是在矛盾斗争中不断发展，不断地相互转化。一些老学校、老教师，在某种程度上讲，可能是基础好一点，经验多一点，但是这只反映了事物的一面；另一面，他们也容易受旧框框多的束缚，因而要脱离原有的窠臼，阻力也会大一点。而那些新学校、新教师，比较起来，虽然有不利的方面，但是他们框框少，束缚少，有利于破旧立新的革命，这是最大的有利条件。由此可见，搞好教学改革不在于客观条件如何，重要的还在于进行教学改革的人的精神状态。
    诚然，各单位的条件不尽相同，基础也不无差异，前进中也必然会有困难。但是，一个革命者的责任，就是要努力创造有利条件，并积极促使不利条件向着有利方向转化，使教学改革工作进展得更有效果。
