　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: The Italian "Oriental Publishing House's" quarterly "Dongfeng" has been published recently. The first issue of this publication contains three works by Chairman Mao Zedong: "Oppose Book Worship," "Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China," and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?"
    The first issue of "Dongfeng" quarterly states in a letter to readers, "Asia today is one of the crucial centers in the historical process, and we are all actors and witnesses of this historical process; Asia is the center of a great anti-imperialist struggle, and the future world's face largely depends on the development of this anti-imperialist center.
    "One of the most important roles in playing these events is China, due to its powerful influence, due to its formulation of theory - this is an indispensable tool for struggle - China is the vanguard of the Asian people's struggle."
    The letter states, "For three years, the 'Oriental Publishing House' has carried out the work of disseminating the main political documents of China and other Asian countries to meet the increasingly broad demands of public opinion.
    "On the basis of achieving this initial success, the 'Oriental Publishing House' decided to publish 'Dongfeng' magazine to carry out in-depth discussions.
    "This new publication, along with booklets, includes full texts, excerpts, or summaries of translations, short news items, and news from articles published in Chinese newspapers or specialized magazines to provide a complete picture of the political issues, economic issues, cultural issues, and scientific issues discussed and resolved in People's China."
    The first issue of this magazine also reprinted articles from Chinese magazines such as "Hongqi" and "Economic Research."

　　意《东风》季刊登载毛主席著作
　　还译载了中国报刊有关政治经济文化科学的文章
    新华社二十日讯　意大利“东方出版社”创办的《东风》季刊，已经在不久前出版。这家刊物的第一期刊载了毛泽东主席的三篇著作：《反对本本主义》、《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》、《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》。
    第一期《东风》季刊在一封致读者信中说，“亚洲今天是历史进程中生死攸关的中心之一，我们都是这一历史进程的演员和见证人；亚洲是一场巨大反帝斗争的中心，未来世界的面貌在很大程度上取决于这一反帝中心的发展。
    “扮演这些事件的最重要角色之一就是中国，由于它强大的影响，由于它制订的理论——这是进行斗争必不可少的工具——中国是亚洲人民进行斗争的先锋队。”
    这封信说，“‘东方出版社’三年来进行了传播中国和亚洲其它国家的主要政治文件的工作，以满足公众舆论日益广泛的要求。
    “‘东方出版社’在取得这一初步成就的基础上，决定出版《东风》杂志以深入开展讨论。
    “这份新刊物同小册子一起都有从中国报纸或专业性杂志上刊载的文章全文、节录或摘要的译文、简讯和新闻，以便提供关于在人民中国讨论和解决的政治问题、经济问题、文化问题和科学问题的全貌。”
    这家杂志的第一期里还转载了中国《红旗》杂志和《经济研究》等刊物上的文章。
