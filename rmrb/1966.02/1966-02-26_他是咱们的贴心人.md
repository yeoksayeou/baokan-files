　　He is Our Intimate
　　Wang Jinkui, Party Branch Secretary of Xiyunsuo Brigade, Gegang Commune, Qixian County, Henan Province

　　Upon hearing the news of Comrade Jiao Yulu's death, the cadres and poor and lower-middle peasant commune members of our village couldn't help but shed tears.

　　I remember in the winter of 1952, the evening the land reform review work team entered the village, Comrade Jiao Yulu was wearing a patched gray cotton coat, carrying a small bundle, and went to live in the home of poor peasant Meng Guanghua.

　　After living in Meng Guanghua's home for some time, he discovered that although the poor and single Han Yunping was a victim of suffering, he didn't always act very actively and didn't often attend meetings. In order to mobilize him, Comrade Jiao Yulu took the initiative to discuss with Han Yunping, saying, "I'm planning to move into your house, is that alright?" Han Yunping said, "My house only has one room, where would I have you stay?" Comrade Jiao Yulu said, "Old Han, wherever you sleep, I'll sleep." That evening, he moved his bed next to Han Yunping's floor. Late at night, Han Yunping lay on the floor without saying a word. Comrade Jiao Yulu said to him, "Old Han, we're both poor people! You and I have been begging for food since we were little, suffering from hardship, we're family." Old Han hummed. He continued, "Before liberation, we poor people suffered hardship, toil, and oppression. Now the Communist Party leads us to turn over, why don't you work?" As he spoke, tears streamed down both of their faces. Han Yunping said sadly to Comrade Jiao Yulu, "Old Jiao, I will listen to you from now on." and said, "We both share a quilt, it's so cold, let's sleep in the same bed!" From then on, Han Yunping's quilt on the bottom, Jiao's quilt on top, the two slept heart-to-heart for almost four months. Whenever Old Han had work to do, Jiao Yulu would help him. Once, Comrade Jiao Yulu helped Old Han build a wall. He picked up a handful of soil and said to Han Yunping, "Old Han, why does the mud need to be mixed with water?" Old Han said, "Without water, it's just loose sand; mixed with water, the wall becomes solid." Comrade Jiao Yulu said happily, "That's right! Only when we poor people unite together can we overthrow the landlords and local bullies and completely turn ourselves over." With the help of Comrade Jiao Yulu, Han Yunping became more and more enlightened, and his work became more active.

　　During the land reform review movement, many poor and lower-middle peasants participated in the peasant association. Although I am a cripple, under the help and education of Comrade Jiao Yulu, I joined the peasant association and soon became the leader of the peasant association group. At that time, I asked Comrade Jiao Yulu, "I can't speak well, can I do it?" He encouraged me, saying, "We poor people have now turned over and become masters, if you don't know how to do something, learn slowly." Comrade Jiao Yulu often gave us Party classes, telling the stories of the Red Army climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands during the Long March, and talking about the happy prospects of socialism and communism, making us poor and lower-middle peasants feel full of energy when we work.

　　Four months later, Comrade Jiao Yulu was leaving. He told me, "Jinkui, I'm leaving. You must stand up straight, work hard, and strive to become a Communist Party member as soon as possible."

　　On the day of his departure, we all saw him off. He shook hands with us one by one and said, "You go back! We will meet again soon. In the future, you must strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, and strive to do a good job." We still remember every word he said clearly.

　　他是咱们的贴心人
　　河南杞县葛岗公社西云所大队党支部书记　王锦魁
    听到焦裕禄同志逝世的消息，俺村的干部和贫下中农社员们，都忍不住落下了眼泪。
    记得在一九五二年冬季，土改复查工作队进村的当晚，焦裕禄同志穿着一身很多补钉的灰色破棉衣，背着一个小行李卷，住到贫农孟广华家去了。
    在孟广华家住了一段时期后，他发现贫农单身汉韩云平虽是个受苦人，但平时表现得不太积极，不常参加会议。为了发动他，焦裕禄同志就主动找韩云平商量说：“我准备搬到你家去住，行吗？”韩云平说：“我家只有一间房，叫你住哪里呢？”焦裕禄同志说：“老韩，你睡在哪里，我就睡在哪里。”当晚，他把床搬到韩云平的地铺旁边。夜深了，韩云平躺在地铺上不吭声，焦裕禄同志就对他说：“老韩，咱们都是穷苦人哪！我和你从小都是逃荒要饭，从苦水里熬出来的，咱是一家人呀。”老韩哼了一声。他又接着说：“解放前咱们穷人受苦受累受压迫，现在共产党领导咱们翻了身，你为什么不干工作呢？”说着说着，他二人都流出了眼泪。韩云平很难过地对焦裕禄同志说：“老焦，今后我一定听你的话。”并说：“咱俩都是一条被子，天这么冷，咱俩睡在一个床上吧！”从此，铺上韩云平的被子，盖上老焦的被子，二人心连心的睡了将近四个月。老韩有什么活，焦裕禄就帮助他干。有一次，焦裕禄同志帮助老韩垛墙。他抓起一把土来向韩云平说：“老韩，泥为什么要用水和呢？”老韩说：“不用水是把散沙；用水和到一块，墙就坚固啦。”焦裕禄同志高兴地说：“对！咱们贫苦人只有团结在一起，才能打倒地主恶霸，彻底翻身。”在焦裕禄同志的帮助下，韩云平的心眼越来越亮，工作积极起来了。
    在土改复查运动中，许多贫下中农都参加了农会。我虽然是个跛子，在焦裕禄同志的帮助教育下，参加农会不久，就当上了农会组长。当时，我问焦裕禄同志：“我不会讲话，能干得了吗？”他鼓励我说：“我们穷人现在翻身当了主人了，不会干的事，慢慢学嘛。”焦裕禄同志经常给我们上党课，讲红军长征时爬雪山过草地的故事，讲社会主义和共产主义的幸福远景，使咱们贫下中农觉得干起工作来满身是劲。
    四个月后，焦裕禄同志要走了。他嘱咐我说：“锦魁，我要走啦。你要挺起腰杆，好好干，争取早日成为一个共产党员。”
    临走那天，我们都送他，他一一和我们握手说：“你们回去吧！不久我们还会见面的。今后你们要加强团结，提高警惕，努力搞好工作。”他的每一句话，至今我们都还记得清清楚楚。
