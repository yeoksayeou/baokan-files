    Highlight Politics, Make Cultivating Revolutionary Talents the Primary Task of Enterprises!
   *Worker's Daily* Editorial Abstract, February 3rd
    The *Worker's Daily* published an editorial on February 3rd entitled "Highlight Politics, Make Cultivating Revolutionary Talents the Primary Task of Enterprises!"
    The editorial stated that highlighting politics means highlighting Mao Zedong Thought and using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. Highlighting politics in enterprises means running our socialist enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought and taking the Chinese path of industrial development. The road taken by the Daqing Oilfield is a road of highlighting politics and running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought.
    The editorial pointed out that to highlight politics in enterprises, we must make cultivating a large number of revolutionary talents the primary task of the enterprise, and making material products the secondary task.
    Some people say: "Isn't the purpose of enterprises to engage in production? To make producing talents the primary task and producing products the secondary task, wouldn't that be turning things upside down?"
    No, it's not turning things upside down at all. Enterprises should not only produce products, but also produce talents and experience, and put producing revolutionary talents first. Why is this? Marxists and Leninists believe that people are the most active and decisive factor in the productive forces, and the human factor is primary. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not ordinary people; they have the greatest revolutionary ideals and the most powerful fighting power, and they can create any human miracle. With a large number of revolutionary talents, why worry about not achieving high-speed, high-level production! With the primary product, there will definitely be the secondary product! It is precisely because the Daqing Oilfield has a highly revolutionary team armed with Mao Zedong Thought that it has been able to build a world-class advanced oilfield at high speed and high standards!
    The working class is the most advanced and revolutionary class. However, the working class always has to absorb its members from other social strata. These people cannot but bring various non-proletarian ideologies. The working class does not live in a vacuum either, and will often be eroded by bourgeois ideology. Therefore, while transforming the objective world, the working class needs to constantly transform its own subjective world. Therefore, we must do political work, the work of cultivating revolutionary talents.
    It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to cultivate people. Countless facts have proven that revolutionary talents cannot be produced spontaneously; a lot of hard and meticulous work needs to be done. And the most important and fundamental of all work is to organize employees to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought creatively. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to arm everyone, so that everyone does not forget class and class struggle, recognizes the situation of international and domestic class struggle, consciously stands at the forefront of class struggle, and constantly struggles with the bourgeoisie and other hostile class elements to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat; let everyone establish a firm proletarian world outlook, master materialist dialectics, consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology, and to eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology in their own minds; let everyone become conscious revolutionary fighters, indomitably fighting to realize the great historical mission of the working class.
    According to the analysis of some factories, there are three factors that affect the thinking of employees: one is the influence of society; the second is the degree of personal awareness; and the third is political work; among them, personal awareness is fundamental. However, personal awareness is influenced by two aspects: one is the political work of the proletariat, and the other is the attack of spontaneous capitalist forces in urban and rural areas. There are no blank spots in people's minds. If proletarian ideology does not occupy it, bourgeois ideology will inevitably occupy it. Strengthening our political work and arming employees with Mao Zedong Thought is to resist the ideological attack of the bourgeoisie, so that people's thinking can be thoroughly and completely proletarianized.
    The editorial concluded by saying that making the cultivation of revolutionary talents the primary task of enterprises and cultivating a new generation with a high degree of communist consciousness is not only related to the high-speed and high-level development of productive forces, but also to the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the preparation of conditions for the gradual transition from socialism to communism in the future. This is a plan for a hundred years, a thousand years, and ten thousand years! With a highly proletarianized, revolutionary, and combat-effective industrial army, we will be able to withstand any storm and always stand invincible!

### 突出政治，把造就革命化人材作为企业第一位任务！

    突出政治，把造就革命化人材作为企业第一位任务！
   《工人日报》二月三日社论摘要
    二月三日《工人日报》发表《突出政治，把造就革命化人材作为企业第一位任务！》的社论。
    社论说，突出政治，就是突出毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。在企业里突出政治，就要按照毛泽东思想来办好我们社会主义企业，走中国式发展工业的道路。大庆油田所走的道路，就是一条突出政治、按照毛泽东思想来办好企业的道路。
    社论指出，在企业里要突出政治，就要把造就大批革命化的人材作为企业的第一位任务，把出物质产品作为第二位的任务。
    有人说：“企业不是搞生产的吗？把出人材作为第一位的任务，出产品作为第二位任务，岂不弄颠倒了吗？”
    不，一点也不颠倒。企业不光要出产品，还要出人材，出经验，而且要把出革命化的人材放在首位。这是为什么呢？马克思列宁主义者认为，人是生产力中最活跃最有决定性的因素，人的因素第一。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，更不是一般的人，具有最伟大的革命理想，具有最强大的战斗力，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来。有了大批革命化的人材，生产何愁打不出高速度、高水平！有了第一位的产品，就一定会有第二位的产品！大庆油田正是因为有了一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的高度革命化队伍，才能够高速度、高水平地建设起具有世界先进水平的大油田！
    工人阶级是最先进、最革命的阶级。但是工人阶级总是要从其他社会阶层中吸收自己的成员。这些人不能不带来各种非无产阶级的思想意识。工人阶级也不是生活在真空地带，会经常受到资产阶级思想的侵蚀。所以，工人阶级在改造客观世界的同时，需要不断地改造自己的主观世界。所以，我们就要做政治工作，做造就革命化人材的工作。
    十年树木，百年树人。无数事实证明，革命化的人材不可能自发地产生，要做大量的、艰苦的、细致的工作。而在所有工作中最重要、最根本的，是组织职工活学活用毛泽东思想。要用毛泽东思想把大家武装起来，让大家不忘阶级和阶级斗争，认清国际国内阶级斗争的形势，自觉地站在阶级斗争的前列，不断地和资产阶级以及其他敌对阶级分子进行斗争，巩固无产阶级专政；让大家树立起坚定的无产阶级世界观，掌握唯物辩证法，自觉地用毛泽东思想，去抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，去清除自己头脑里所受的资产阶级思想影响；让大家都成为自觉的革命战士，百折不挠地为实现工人阶级的伟大历史使命而奋斗。
    根据一些工厂的分析，影响职工思想的因素有三：一是社会上的影响；二是本人的觉悟程度；三是政治工作；其中本人觉悟是基本的。但本人觉悟又受两方面的影响，一方面是无产阶级的政治工作，一方面是城乡资本主义自发势力的进攻。人的头脑里边是没有空白点的，无产阶级思想不去占领，资产阶级思想就必然要去占领。我们加强政治工作，用毛泽东思想武装职工，就是要抵制资产阶级的思想进攻，让人的思想彻头彻尾、彻里彻外地无产阶级化。
    社论最后说，把造就革命化的人材作为企业第一位任务，培养具有高度共产主义觉悟的一代新人，不仅关系到高速度、高水平发展生产力的问题，还关系到巩固无产阶级专政，关系到为将来由社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义准备条件的问题。这是百年大计，千年大计，万年大计！有了一支高度无产阶级化、革命化、战斗化的产业大军，我们就能经得起任何惊涛骇浪，永远立于不败之地！
