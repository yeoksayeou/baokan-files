    Xinhua News Agency, 11th. According to Taiwan newspapers, the Indian government recently sent former Member of Parliament and Information Officer V. K. B. Pillai to Taiwan to once again secretly collude with the Chiang gang.

    According to reports from the Chiang gang's "Central News Agency" and the "Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily News," Pillai arrived in Taiwan on January 28th and engaged in activities for seven days. Upon arriving in Taipei, he said that his "visit" to Taiwan was "originally authorized by the late former Indian Prime Minister Shastri and now has the support of the new Prime Minister, Mrs. Gandhi."

    He also revealed that the Indian Ministry of External Affairs "attaches great importance" to his trip to Taiwan; before his departure, Indian Foreign Minister Singh specifically summoned him to his "office for a conversation" and asked him to provide a "detailed report" on the "course of his talks" with the Chiang gang upon his return to India.

    Taiwan newspapers revealed that during his stay in Taiwan, Pillai held "talks" with the heads of the Chiang gang and made several speeches advocating for the "normalization of diplomatic relations" between India and Chiang and strengthening "cooperation." On February 3rd, Chiang Kai-shek also "received" Pillai and held secret talks with him.

    It is also reported that in late January, a group of Chiang gang members, with the permission of the Indian government, went to New Delhi to attend a conference of the Pacific Area Travel Association. During the conference, the Indian government showed "extreme courtesy" to these Chiang gang members, and Indian President Radhakrishnan even asked them to convey his "greetings to Chiang Kai-shek."

    Since the Indian government deliberately provoked the Sino-Indian border conflict, the Indian government has repeatedly sent people to collude with the Chiang gang. Now, just as U.S. imperialism is intensifying its military provocations against China, the Indian government is once again sending people to engage in activities in Taiwan. This is yet another self-exposure of the Indian reactionaries serving the U.S. imperialist anti-China conspiracy.

    印度反动派为美帝反华阴谋效劳
    新德里又派人同蒋帮秘密勾结
    印官员在台湾鼓吹加强同蒋帮“合作”
    新华社十一日讯　据台湾报纸报道：印度政府最近派遣前国会议员、新闻官委拉育坦到台湾，再次同蒋帮进行秘密勾结。
    据蒋帮“中央社”和《台湾新生报》消息说，委拉育坦一月二十八日到台湾，活动了七天。他在到达台北时说，他这次“访问”台湾，“原本授意于印度前故总理夏斯特里，现在又得到了新任总理甘地夫人的支持。”
    他还透露，印度外交部对他的台湾之行“很表重视”；临行前，印度外交部长辛格特别召他到“办公室谈话”，并要他回国后把同蒋帮“会谈的经过”作“详细报告”。
    台湾报纸透露，委拉育坦在台湾期间，曾同蒋帮头目举行“会谈”，并多次发表谈话鼓吹印蒋“外交关系正常化”和加强“合作”。二月三日，蒋介石还“接见”了委拉育坦，同他进行了密谈。
    另据报道，一月下旬，一批蒋帮分子经过印度政府允许，曾到新德里参加了太平洋区旅行协会的会议。会议期间，印度政府对这批蒋帮分子“极为礼遇”，印度总统拉达克里希南还要他们向蒋介石致“问候之意”。
    自从印度政府蓄意挑起中印边境冲突以来，印度政府曾多次派人同蒋帮进行勾结。现在，正当美帝国主义加紧对中国进行军事挑衅的时候，印度政府再次派人到台湾活动，这是印度反动派为美帝国主义反华阴谋效劳的又一次自我暴露。
