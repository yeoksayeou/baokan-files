    A Drop of Acid
    Worker of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Coking Plant, Zhan Zhengxiang
    The rain kept falling, the wind howled, worrying the three young men in the pump room, Chen Xiupu, Chen Xianbang, and Li Nianyin.
    Six eyes in the pump room stared intently at the acid tanks and pipes outside the glass window, their six brows furrowing higher and higher. The relentless raindrops beat against the pipes, as if striking their hearts, and their three faces grew increasingly anxious.
    It was almost time to start the machine and send the acid. At this moment, how could they inspect the acid tanks and pipes, covered in raindrops and water droplets, to determine if the equipment was leaking acid? Communist Party member Chen Xiupu raised his head, looked at the sky, and waved his hand: "Go!" Chen Xianbang and Li Nianyin followed him and rushed out. These young men, once called reckless, had experienced so many hardships and tortuous paths in the past two years! To prevent acid from seeping out, day and night, they used their calloused hands to caress the countless welds on the acid tanks and pipes inside and outside the pump room, again and again; in countless days of neglecting sleep and meals, they repeatedly experimented, failed and failed again, and finally used indigenous methods to create noble acid-resistant fillers. Two years ago, when they first came into contact with acid, they didn't even know its temperament. Many times, the acid burned their clothes, their skin, and corroded and melted the newly painted pipe walls and newly laid floor tiles. However, no matter how fierce the acid was, it could not shake their steel-like will. Now, they have basically eliminated the acid and gas leaks, turning this pump room, which used to leak acid and gas everywhere, into a flower of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel.
    Not a single drop of acid can be allowed to leak! Now they are fighting in the wind and rain to check the equipment and pipes for acid leaks. Yes, even a small crack, a sesame-sized drop of acid, will create a river of acid and destroy all the surrounding equipment. Not a single drop of acid can be allowed to leak! These three young men are checking along the crisscrossing network of pipes and large acid tanks. When their eyes can hardly distinguish between acid and rainwater, they use their hands, feeling the seams and joints of the pipes. The rain soaked their clothes, but they didn't feel it at all; the rain blurred their eyes, but they didn't even blink; to clearly distinguish between water and acid, they used their clothes to wipe the water-soaked pipes when the cotton yarn became wet. At this moment, these three young hearts are completely immersed in a tense and meticulous battle.
    Minute after minute passed, they checked again and again. Everything was ready, and it was time to turn on the power and start the pump. Just then, Li Nianyin shouted next to the acid tank: "Acid!" The hearts of the two partners were suddenly suspended, and four eyes, like lightning, immediately projected over. Then, the three of them squatted down together and found a sesame-sized milky white droplet emerging from a weld near the ground. They saw the droplet gradually spread out, forming a thin line wriggling, gradually rising a little milky white mist. Don't underestimate this one drop of acid, as long as it comes into contact with the right amount of water, even steel or even high-grade tiles will turn into powder! At this moment, the hearts of these three partners were as heavy as this three-hundred-ton acid tank.
    "Find a welder!" Chen Xiupu decisively issued the order. Chen Xianbang and Li Nianyin followed his voice and went straight to the workshop. No sooner said than done, the technician and welder arrived immediately. At this time, Chen Xiupu held a piece of lead sheet and said loudly: "Weld, weld towards me!" The master welder weighed the welding handle, looked at Chen Xiupu's hand on the lead sheet, and hesitated. "Weld, quickly weld towards me!" Chen Xiupu urged, and the master welder then asked his assistant to "turn on the power." Sparks flew with a crackling sound, Chen Xiupu's hand was inlaid with a blue halo, sweat mixed with rain, flowing down his face, his two partners reached out to replace him, but he didn't even grunt, didn't even move.
    When the arc light went out, people rushed to check Chen Xiupu's hand that was holding the lead sheet, but he waved that strong hand: "Start the pump!" Suddenly, a loud melody sounded in the pump room, the loud sound seemed to be playing a song of praise.

    一滴酸
    马鞍山钢铁焦化厂工人　詹正香
    雨不停地下着，风呼呼地刮着，急坏了泵房里陈修普、陈先邦、李年寅这三个年青人。
    泵房的玻璃窗上，六只眼睛紧盯着窗外的酸罐、管道，那六条眉毛越拧越高。不停的雨点打在管道上，象打在他们的心窝里，那三张脸呵，越来越显得焦急不安了。
    眼看就要开机送酸，此刻，怎样才能从那遍身雨点水珠的酸罐、管道上检查出设备是否漏酸的情况呢？共产党员陈修普昂头望了望天，一摆手：“走！”陈先邦、李年寅便跟着冲了出去。这几个曾经被人称为不知天高地厚的小伙子，两年来，他们经历了多少艰辛曲折的道路！为了不让酸渗透出来，多少个白天黑夜，他们用一双结了茧的手，一遍又一遍地抚摸着这泵房内外那酸罐和管道上数不清的焊缝；多少废寝忘食的日子，他们反复地试验，失败又失败，终于用土法造出了高贵的耐酸填料。两年前，当他们初次与酸打交道时，他们连酸的脾性还摸不着，多少次，酸把他们的衣服烧坏了，把他们的皮肤烧烂，把新漆的管壁和新铺的地面磁砖腐蚀烧融，然而，酸再凶再厉害，始终不能动摇他们钢铁般的意志。如今，他们基本上消灭了漏酸漏气现象，把这个到处漏酸漏气的泵房，变成了马钢的一朵鲜花。
    不能让一滴酸漏出！现在他们为检查设备和管道上是否漏酸，在风风雨雨中奋战着。是的，哪怕是一个小缝，一个芝麻大的酸滴，它将会造成一道酸的河，毁灭这周围的一切设备，决不能允许有一滴酸漏出！这三个年轻人顺着纵横交错的管道网和粗大的酸罐，察看着，当眼睛难以区别酸液和雨水时，他们就用手，在条条焊缝和一根根管道的接头处抚摸着。雨水湿透了他们的衣服，他们根本没有感觉到；雨水模糊了他们的眼睛，他们眨也没眨；为了清楚地辨别出水与酸，棉纱浸湿了，便用衣襟去擦那水湿的管道。此刻，这三颗年青的心，完全浸沉在一场紧张而精细的战斗中。
    时间一分一秒地过去，他们一遍又一遍地检查着。一切准备就绪，马上送电开泵了。就在这时，李年寅在酸罐旁喊了一声：“酸！”两个伙伴的心一下悬了起来，四只眼睛象电光一般，立即投射过去，紧接着，三个人一齐趴到地下，发现在靠地面一条焊缝处，冒出一个芝麻大的乳白色小液滴，只见那液滴渐渐散开，形成一条细线在蠕动着，渐渐升起一点乳白色的雾气。别看是一滴酸，只要它一接触到适量的水，哪怕是钢铁，甚至高级磁砖，也会变成粉末！此刻，这三个伙伴的心呵，象这三百吨的大酸罐那么沉重。
    “找电焊工来！”陈修普当机立断，发出了号令。陈先邦和李年寅随着他的声音，直奔车间而去。说时迟，那时快，技术员和电焊工立即赶来了。这时，陈修普的手捂着一块铅皮，大声说道：“焊，朝我这边焊！”电焊老师傅掂了掂焊把头，看着那铅皮上的陈修普的手，迟疑了。“焊，快朝这边焊。”陈修普催促着，老师傅这才叫助手“送电”，火花哔哔叭叭地迸飞着，陈修普的手被镶上了一道蓝色的光环，汗水和着雨水，顺着他的脸往下流淌，他的两个伙伴一齐伸出手要接替他，可他连吭也不吭，动也不动。
    当电弧花熄灭，人们抢着来检查陈修普扶铅皮的那只手时，他却把那只坚强的手一挥：“开泵！”顿时，泵房里响起一阵宏亮的乐曲，那宏亮的音响仿佛在高奏一支赞美的歌。
