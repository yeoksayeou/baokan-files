    A rural young woman transforms from a "good old Joe" who doesn't care about anything to a "Li Shuangshuang" who likes to meddle in "other people's business": The reason lies in:
　　I Do As Chairman Mao Says
　　Gu Quan'ying, Commune Member of Xiexin Brigade, Zhengyi Commune, Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province
    I am the daughter of a poor and lower-middle peasant, nineteen years old this year, and have been participating in agricultural production for several years. In the past, I only knew how to work and eat, and rarely spoke. All day long, all year round, I only cared about burying my head in production. Other people's business and the team's business seemed to have nothing to do with me. When I saw some commune members in production only caring about work points and not quality, I didn't dare to offer them any opinions, fearing arguments and scolding. So everyone in the village said I was a complete "good old Joe."
    After the Socialist Education Movement was launched, the work team organized us to study Chairman Mao's works. Only then did I begin to understand that my "good old Joe" act wasn't so good. A truly good person should always care about the collective interest and always think of others. Therefore, I started meddling in "other people's business." Anything that was detrimental to the collective, I would manage; anything that was beneficial to the collective, I would do. The commune members all said: "Quan'ying has completely changed."
    Once, when the team was planting wheat, our women's team leader was only concerned with speed and didn't pay attention to quality. The clods were made very large, and the furrows were crooked, uneven. I thought, wouldn't this affect the team's wheat yield? I should offer her my opinion. But then I thought, she is older than me and has more production experience. Would I cause an argument if I criticized her? While I was hesitating, I remembered "Combat Liberalism." In this article, Chairman Mao said: "Because they are acquaintances, fellow villagers,... knowing that something is wrong, they don't engage in principled arguments with them, but let it go on, seeking peace and amiability.... The result is harmful to the group and also harmful to the individual." I thought, if I don't bring it up to her, wouldn't I be committing liberalism? I should listen to Chairman Mao and combat liberalism! Therefore, I went over to her and said, "Niangniang, the quality of your work today is not good enough. The commune members are watching the furrows you are making and they need to be revised." Niangniang said, "My work is not good, I need to learn from you." She immediately revised her work. My mother saw it and blamed me, saying, "You are so young, what do you know! Meddling with your Niangniang." I said, "As long as it's right, I should manage. Didn't you also study the article 'Combat Liberalism' a few days ago?" My mother didn't say anything more.
  Another time, the brigade leader came to the team to plant wheat. He only managed to do half a *mu* of wheat field in half a day, and the quality was not good. The commune members all had opinions, but they didn't want to say anything. I thought, even though he is a brigade leader, if he has shortcomings, he should be criticized, otherwise, wouldn't that be committing liberalism again? So I boldly offered him criticism. The brigade leader also humbly accepted my opinion and corrected his shortcomings.
    After studying "Combat Liberalism," I deeply felt that in order to safeguard the collective interest and the interests of the masses, when I see those behaviors that are detrimental to the collective, I should oppose them, even if it is my mother and my boyfriend. Once, I saw that when my mother and sister were bundling rice, the rice ears that fell on the ground were not put into the rice bundles. How could we bring every grain home like that! I said to my mother, "Mother, you need to pay attention and put the rice ears that fall on the ground into the rice bundles." My mother didn't respond, and I said it again. As a result, my mother lost her temper and said, "There is only heaven covering the earth, not the earth covering heaven. You dare to manage your mother." Some commune members nearby also said, "Quan'ying ah! Even if you don't look, you still need to consider your mother's feelings. After all, your mother raised you, not you raising your mother." I said, "If what is being done is wrong, even a good grandmother should be managed." After returning home, I said to my mother, "I didn't do this to disrespect you as an elder, but to improve collective production. Chairman Mao taught me to do this." I also said, "We poor and lower-middle peasants should listen to Chairman Mao, establish the attitude of masters, set an example in everything, and care about the collective." After listening to my words, my mother felt that it made sense and realized that she was wrong. From then on, she also became more concerned about the collective.
    My boyfriend is a member of the Communist Youth League, but in recent years he has only cared about burying his head in production and hasn't been very enthusiastic about various tasks. A few days ago, when the youth meeting was held, other youths came, but he didn't come. I asked a youth from the same village as him, "Why didn't Dnan come?" This youth said, "Dnan's mind is not working, he went to bed early tonight." I was very annoyed when I heard this, but I also felt that I had a responsibility to help him. The next day I went to ask him, "Is your father a poor peasant? Are you a son of a poor peasant? Are you a member of the Communist Youth League?" He said, "Yes!" I said, "Since that's the case, you should act like a son of a poor peasant, like a member of the Communist Youth League, and take the lead in everything. If you don't take the lead, should we ask landlords and rich peasants to take the lead?" He had nothing to say. He promised at the time that he would actively participate in the meeting next time. Another time, he was unhappy about night duty. After I found out, I went to ask him, "Are you listening to Chairman Mao? Are you wholeheartedly for the revolution? If you are wholeheartedly for the revolution, you must do a good job of militia night duty." He finally listened to me. Later, every time he did night duty, he did it conscientiously.

### 一个农村女青年，从百事不管的“老好人”，转变为好管“闲事”的“李双双”，原因在那里呢？原因就在： 毛主席怎么讲，我就怎么做

    一个农村女青年，从百事不管的“老好人”，转变为好管“闲事”的“李双双”，原因在那里呢？原因就在：
　　毛主席怎么讲，我就怎么做
　　江苏省昆山县正仪公社协心大队社员　顾全英
    我是一个贫下中农的女儿，今年十九岁，参加农业生产已经好几年了。过去，我只晓得做生活，吃饭，平时难得开声口。一天到晚，一年到头，只顾埋头生产。别人的事、队里的事好象都和我没有关系，在生产中看到有的社员光图工分，不顾质量，自己也不敢向他们提意见，怕吵怕骂。所以村里人都说我是一个道道地地的“老好人”。
    社会主义教育运动开展以后，工作队组织我们学习毛主席著作，这时我才开始明白我这个“老好人”做得不算好。一个真正的好人，应该时时关心集体利益，处处为别人着想。因此，我开始好管起“闲事”来了。只要对集体不利的事，我就去管；对集体有利的事我就去做。社员们都说：“全英这个人完全变了”。
    有一次，队里种麦，我们的妇女队长光顾速度快，不注意质量。土块弄得很大，?头做得弯弯曲曲，高低不平。我想，这样不是要影响队里小麦产量吗？应该向她提出意见。但又一想，她年纪比我大，生产经验比我多，我去批评她，是不是会闹出意见来呢？正在犹豫不决的时候，我想起了《反对自由主义》。毛主席在这篇文章里说：“因为是熟人、同乡、……明知不对，也不同他们作原则上的争论，任其下去，求得和平和亲热。……结果是有害于团体，也有害于个人。”我想，假使不向她提出来，不是犯了自由主义吗？我应该听毛主席的话，反对自由主义！因此，我走过去对她讲：“娘娘，你今天做的生活质量不够，社员都在看你做的?头，需要修改修改。”娘娘说：“我这生活做的是不好，我要向你们学习。”当时就修改了自己的生活。我姆妈看见了就怪我说：“你年纪轻轻的，懂得啥！管起你娘娘来了。”我说：“只要管得对，就应该管。前几天你不是也学习了《反对自由主义》这篇文章了吗？”姆妈就不再说啥了。
  又有一次，大队长来队里种麦，半天时间只弄了半?麦地，并且质量不好。社员们看了都有意见，但是不愿讲。我想，他虽然是个大队长，有了缺点，也应该批评，不然不又是犯了自由主义吗？于是我大胆地向他提出了批评，大队长也虚心接受了我的意见，纠正了缺点。
    学习了《反对自由主义》，我深深地觉得，为了维护集体利益，维护群众的利益，看到那些不利于集体的行为，就应该反对，就是对待我的姆妈和我的对象也要这样做。有一次，我看到姆妈和妹妹捆稻时，落到地上的稻穗没有塞到稻把里去，这样那能颗粒还家！我就对姆妈讲：“姆妈，你们要注意一点，把落在地上的稻穗塞到稻把里去。”姆妈不响，我又讲了一遍。结果姆妈大发脾气，说：“只有天盖地，没有地盖天，你倒敢管起娘来了。”旁边有的社员也讲：“全英啊！千勿看，万勿看，也要看看娘的面。到底是娘养你出来，不是你养娘出来。”我说：“做的不对，就是好婆也应该管。”回家后，我对姆妈说：“我这样做并不是不尊敬你长辈，是为了搞好集体生产，是毛主席教导我这样做的。”我又说：“我们贫下中农应该听毛主席的话，树立起主人翁的态度，事事以身作则，关心集体才对。”我姆妈听了我的话，觉得有道理，认识到自己的不对。从那以后，她也变得对集体关心了。
    我的对象是个共青团员，但这几年他只顾埋头生产，各项工作不怎么热心，前些天开青年会，别的青年都来了，而他没有来。我问一位和他同村的青年：“大男怎么没有来呢？”这位青年说：“大男思想不来事，今晚他老早就睡觉了。”我听了心里很恼火，但又觉得自己有责任帮助他。第二天我就去问他：“你的阿爸是不是一个贫农？你是不是一个贫农的儿子？是不是一个共青团员？”他说：“是格！”我说：“既然是的，你就要象一个贫农的儿子，象一个共青团员，处处起带头作用。你不起带头作用，难道叫地主、富农来起带头作用吗？”他无话可说了，当时保证，下次一定积极参加会议。又有一次他不高兴防夜，我知道后去问他：“你到底听不听毛主席的话？是不是一心为革命？假使是一心为革命，就要把民兵防夜工作做好。”他终于听了我的话，后来每次防夜，他都认真地去防了。
