    In the freezing winter night, the office of the Shaguoyuan Production Team of the Zhuangzhou People's Commune in Mengcheng, Anhui, was brightly lit and filled with warmth: the commune members were discussing the next step in their winter work.
    In 1965, this team's grain yield per mu exceeded the "National Program for Agricultural Development" target, shedding the label of being a backward team that relied on relief grain. However, its cotton production still lagged behind the Huanghai Production Team of the same brigade. What to do? Catch up! Surpass them! As the saying goes, "A crop is like a flower, it all depends on fertilizer." To catch up, they had to vigorously grasp fertilizer this winter. But now the source of fertilizer had become a problem. What to do?
    "I say," the voice of old poor peasant Li Chengfu rang out in the momentarily quiet meeting place, "We can't just watch others digging pond mud and be envious. Let's have a full mobilization and look everywhere. I don't believe we can't find a fertilizer source!"
      "Right!" Production Team Leader Lou Diansheng stood up, pointed to the article "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" in the *Selected Readings from the Works of Chairman Mao* in front of the oil lamp, and said decisively, "The Foolish Old Man's family had the determination to move two big mountains. We are members of the people's commune led by Chairman Mao, can we let the fertilizer source stump us!"
    The next day, just as the east revealed a sliver of dawn, Lou Diansheng shouldered his manure basket and walked out the door. At that moment, the doors of several households in the east and west courtyards were also heard opening. He knew that these commune members were also restless, and his heart couldn't help but feel sweet: what a shared enthusiasm for being masters of the house!
    The cold wind rushed against his face. Lou Diansheng, carrying his manure basket, went straight to the county town. He didn't enter the main streets, nor did he stroll through the alleys, but walked around the city moat, stopping and looking. When he reached the bridge outside the East Gate, the blackened brick wall by the water attracted him. He quickly took off his shoes and rolled up his trousers, carefully stepping into the water.
    "Uncle, what do you want to do?" several Young Pioneers on the shore asked with concern.
    "Well, I'm testing how deep or shallow it is in here."
    "Uncle, the water is cold!" One Young Pioneer, while speaking, readily dropped a long spear – a bamboo pole – used for practicing bayonet drills to Lou Diansheng, "Uncle, you can use this to measure!"
    Lou Diansheng excitedly took the small bamboo pole, inserted it into the center of the moat, and pulled it up to look. Good heavens, the sludge was waist-deep! So he immediately ran ashore and rushed back to the village in one breath. He ran into old man Li Chengfu head-on. Before Diansheng could speak, old man Chengfu said, "Diansheng, I pondered all night and came up with an idea. I think that the old city moat, filled with stagnant water for years, must be a big black gold nest..."
    "Ha!" Diansheng couldn't help but exclaim,
  "We're like plucking the strings and hitting the clapperboard—our thoughts are in sync!"
    Lou Diansheng patted old man Chengfu's hand and said, "I've already measured it. Look! How's the black mud on my legs?!"
    Old man Chengfu carefully examined Diansheng's muddy legs and said excitedly, "Hey! Now we have a place to put our energy!"
    The news that "a fertilizer source has been found" spread throughout the village like wildfire. This village of sixty-two households immediately became lively. As if someone had issued a mobilization order, people rushed to their homes, grabbed shovels and hoes, carried baskets and buckets, gathered together, waiting to set off.
    Lou Diansheng, carrying a large shovel on his shoulder, his dark face beaming with radiance, strode forward, with the commune members following closely behind, heading straight for the East Gate.
    Halfway there, they suddenly heard someone shouting repeatedly from behind. Everyone turned their heads to look: it turned out to be Yang Ruihua, who had been married for two years and given birth to a chubby baby boy last month. Yesterday, her family came to pick her up, and the team leader approved her five days of leave to go back. But why was she back today?
    "Ruihua, is something the matter?" Lou Diansheng looked at her with concern.
      "Yes," Ruihua said, panting, waving the iron shovel in her hand, "To participate in digging fertilizer!"
    "Is your body up to it?"
      "It is."
    The team leader understood the wishes of this young member of the Communist Youth League and knew that persuasion would be useless, so he said warmly, "Go ahead! But be careful with your body!"
    Go ahead! As soon as this army arrived at the city moat, poor peasant commune members Zhao Hongen and Li Jinghua, under the leadership of Lou Diansheng, dug waterways, built embankments, and built dams. Buckets flew in both the north and south ends, those scooping water, those slinging mud, those repairing slopes, those paving roads... In an instant, the voices of people rose to a crescendo, and the labor chants shook the sky.
    The battle continued to the fourth day – January 10th. After a day of labor, the commune members gathered in the office to study Chairman Mao's works. Suddenly, the radio loudspeaker sounded: "The local area will turn cloudy on the 11th, and there will be light to moderate rain on the 12th..."
    Lou Diansheng put down the book in his hand, turned up the lamp a little, stood up, and said to everyone, "It's going to rain. What do you all think we should do about digging the sludge?"
    "What to do?" The room seemed to explode with thunder, "No question, finish the task before the rain!"
    "Right!" Lou Diansheng raised his arm and said, "We must remember Chairman Mao's words: Overcoming difficulties is victory!"
    On the morning of January 11th, dark clouds filled the sky, frost covered the ground, and the northeast wind bent the branches of the trees. The fertilizer accumulation site was in full swing, the sound of mud being slung ashore crackled, and those carrying mud shuttled back and forth non-stop. The wind grew stronger and stronger, the piles of sludge on the shore grew higher and higher; the weather grew colder and colder, but the commune members worked harder and harder.

    数九寒天荡春风
    周恒轩
    寒风凛冽的夜里，安徽蒙城庄周公社沙果园生产队的办公室里却是灯光明亮，热气腾腾：社员们正在商讨着这冬忙的下一步棋如何走法。
    这个队一九六五年粮食单产超了“纲要”，把过去吃救济粮的落后帽子摘掉了；可是，棉产还比同大队的黄海生产队差一着。怎么办？要赶！要超！俗话说，“庄稼一枝花，全靠肥当家”。要赶上去，今冬就得狠抓肥料。可是现在肥源却成了问题，咋办？
    “我说，”静了一会的会场上响起了老贫农李成夫的声音，“咱不能看人家挖塘泥光跟着眼馋。咱也来个全体动员，八方出动。我就不信找不着肥源！”
      “对！”生产队长娄殿生站起身来，指着油灯前《毛主席著作选读》中的《愚公移山》一文，斩钉截铁地说，“愚公一家人都有决心搬走两座大山，我们是毛主席领导下的人民公社社员，还能叫肥源难住！”
    第二天，东方才露出一线鱼肚白，娄殿生便挎上粪箕，开门走出来了。此刻，东西院几家的门都响了。他知道这些社员们也是睡不安稳，心里不由一阵蜜甜：同是一副当家人的热心肠哟！
    寒风扑面吹来，娄殿生挎着粪箕，径直往县城走去。他不进大街，不串小巷，却绕着城壕走走停停，停停看看。当他走到东关外桥头时，那水边发黑的砖墙把他吸引住了。他急忙脱鞋挽裤，一步一试地走进水里。
    “叔叔，您想干啥？”岸上几个红领巾关切地发问。
    “唔，我试试这里头是深是浅。”
    “叔叔，天冷水凉呀！”一个红领巾一面说着，一面顺手撂下一支学练拼刺用的长枪——竹竿给娄殿生，“叔叔，您拿去量吧！”
    娄殿生兴奋地接过小竹竿，插进壕心，拔上一看，好家伙，污泥足有齐腰深哪！于是他立刻拔腿上岸，一口气奔进了村。迎头碰上了李成夫老汉。没容殿生开口，成夫老汉忙说：“殿生，我昨晚琢磨一夜，倒想出个门道。我想那陈年积水不干的老城壕里，保准是个大大的黑金窝……”
    “嗬！”殿生再也忍不住了，
  “咱俩可是拉着弦子打脚板——想（响）到一块了！”
    娄殿生拍拍成夫老汉的手，说道：“我已经去量过了。您看嘛！我这腿上的黑泥咋样？！”
    成夫老汉仔细打量一下殿生那半截泥腿，兴冲冲地说道：“嗨！这下子，劲有处使喽！”
    “肥源找到了”的消息象长了翅膀，一霎时传遍全村。这六十二户的村子马上闹腾起来。仿佛有谁下了动员令，人们各奔各家，抓锹扛锨，抬筐背桶，聚在一起，等候出发。
    娄殿生肩扛大锨，黑黑的脸膛放着光彩，大步向前走着，社员紧随在后，直奔东关而来。
    走到半路，忽听后边有人连声大喊，大伙扭头一看：原来是杨瑞华，过门两年，上月生了个胖娃娃。昨儿个娘家来人接她，队长准她五天假让她回去了。可她为啥今天就回来了呢？
    “瑞华，有事吗？”娄殿生关心地打量着她。
      “有事，”瑞华喘着粗气，扬扬手中铁锨，“参加挖肥！”
    “你身子能行吗？”
      “能行。”
    队长了解这位年轻的共青团员的心意，知道劝说无用，便热情地说道：“干吧！可要注意身子！”
    干吧！这支大军一到城壕边，贫农社员赵洪恩和李景华在娄殿生的带领下，挖开水路，打埂培坝，南北两端水桶齐飞，戽水的戽水，甩泥的甩泥，修坡的、垫路的……霎时间人声鼎沸，劳动号子震响天空。
    战斗进行到第四天——元月十号。一天劳动之后，社员都聚在办公室里学毛主席著作。突然，广播喇叭响了：“本县地区十一号转阴，十二号有小雨到中雨……”
    娄殿生放下手里的书，把灯头挑亮一些，站起身来，面对大家说道：“要下雨了，咱们挖污泥的事，大伙看，怎么办？”
    “怎么办？”屋里刷地象是炸了雷，“没二话，抢在雨前，完成任务！”
    “对！”娄殿生振臂说道：“我们要记住毛主席的话：克服困难，就是胜利！”
    元月十一日清晨，乌云布满天空，寒霜遍地，东北风吹弯了树枝。积肥工地上却干得热火朝天，甩泥上岸辟哩拍啦地响，抬泥的来往穿梭不停。风越刮越大，岸上的污泥越堆越高；天越来越冷，社员们却越干越欢。
