    Leading Cadres Must Take the Lead in Studying and Applying
    The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee has decided to launch a discussion on the relationship between politics and professional work among cadres in various districts and city-level directly affiliated organs in the autonomous region, in order to enhance cadres' consciousness in studying Chairman Mao's works.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 4th) The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasizes that studying Chairman Mao’s works should be taken as the guiding principle for promoting all work, and calls on leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in studying and applying it well.
    The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened successive meetings of the Standing Committee and enlarged meetings of the District and Municipal Party Secretaries to discuss the implementation of the decision of the Central-South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on deeply developing the movement to study Chairman Mao’s works.
    The meeting believed that using Mao Zedong Thought to take command and studying Chairman Mao’s works is the fundamental key to doing all our work well and successfully realizing the Third Five-Year Plan. For every Communist Party member and revolutionary cadre, this is a question of whether to be revolutionary or not, whether to be wholeheartedly revolutionary or half-heartedly revolutionary, whether to be thoroughly revolutionary or to give up halfway.
    The meeting pointed out that in Guangxi, the movement of cadres and workers, peasants and soldiers to study Chairman Mao’s works is flourishing, and a number of activists and advanced units in studying Chairman Mao’s works have emerged on all fronts. Now, it is necessary to guide the situation, strengthen leadership, earnestly summarize experiences, establish typical examples, and further deepen the study movement.
    The meeting especially emphasized that leading cadres at all levels and in all departments must take the lead in studying and applying it, and become models of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works. The First Secretaries of Party committees at all levels, the top leaders of all departments and units, and the core members of leadership at all levels and in all departments must personally lead the study of Chairman Mao’s works, placing it at the forefront of all work.
    The Regional Party Committee has decided to immediately launch a major debate on the relationship between politics and professional work among cadres in various districts and city-level directly affiliated organs in the autonomous region, in order to enhance cadres' consciousness in studying Chairman Mao's works.

    领导干部必须带头学带头用
    广西壮族自治区党委决定在自治区各地、市直属机关干部中开展一次关于政治与业务关系的讨论，增强干部学习毛主席著作的自觉性。
    据新华社南宁四日电　中共广西壮族自治区委员会强调把学习毛主席著作作为推动一切工作的纲，号召各级领导干部带头学好用好。
    中共广西壮族自治区委员会最近接连召开了常委会议和地、市委书记（扩大）会议，讨论贯彻执行中共中央中南局关于深入开展学习毛主席著作运动的决定。
    会议认为：用毛泽东思想挂帅，学习毛主席著作，是我们做好一切工作、胜利实现第三个五年计划的根本关键。对于每一个共产党员和革命干部来说，就是革命不革命的问题，是全心全意革命还是半心半意革命的问题，是彻底革命还是半途而废的问题。
    会议指出，在广西，广大干部和工农群众学习毛主席著作的运动，正在蓬勃发展，在各个战线上已经涌现出一批学习毛主席著作的积极分子和先进单位。现在必须因势利导，加强领导，认真总结经验，树立典型，使这个学习运动进一步地深入发展。
    会议特别强调各级、各部门的领导干部必须带头学，带头用，成为活学活用毛主席著作的表率。各级党委的第一书记，各部门各单位的第一把手和各级各部门的领导核心成员，都要亲自领导学习毛主席著作，把它摆在一切工作的首位。
    区党委决定立即在自治区各地、市直属机关干部中开展一次关于政治与业务关系的大辩论，增强干部学习毛主席著作的自觉性。
