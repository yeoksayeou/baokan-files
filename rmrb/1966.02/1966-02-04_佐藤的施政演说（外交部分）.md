    (Reported by our newspaper) Tokyo, January 28 (Xinhua) – According to Kyodo News Agency, Japanese Prime Minister Sato delivered a policy speech at the plenary session of the House of Representatives on January 28. The contents related to diplomacy are as follows:
    I have always adhered to peace as the basic principle of diplomacy, but the road to achieving true peace is full of difficulties and obstacles. Fundamentally, all countries in the world should not stubbornly adhere to their own主張 (zhǔzhāng) claims, but should maintain an attitude of trying to solve problems through negotiation and make unremitting efforts to do so. This is the road to achieving true peace.
    In this sense, the most urgent issue is the peaceful settlement of the Vietnam dispute.
    I had the opportunity to hear a detailed explanation of the United States' peace efforts. At that time, I was affirmatively informed that the United States has flexible ideas for solving the problem and is earnestly seeking peace. I strongly hope that those belonging to the North Vietnamese regime and the so-called National Liberation Front will not miss this opportunity to achieve peace and will show an attitude of approaching peace.
    The government has been calling on relevant parties in North Vietnam and other countries not to ignore this strong world opinion, but to promptly respond positively to the call for peace negotiations. However, to this day, there has been no satisfactory sign, which is very regrettable. I now urge the relevant countries to exercise restraint again, and express my determination to continue to make the greatest efforts to resolve the Vietnam issue, no matter how the situation develops in the future.
    If we consider that our role in the international community has become more important since our country was elected as a member of the Security Council at the 20th session of the United Nations General Assembly, then we must say that the responsibility for striving for peace is very heavy.
    On the other hand, in the post-war world situation, it is obvious that a country cannot ensure its own security by itself. As some people say, the idea that our country can unilaterally abolish the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and declare neutrality to ensure our country's security is a big illusion. I believe that maintaining the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty system is the most realistic policy to ensure our country's peace and security.
    Maintaining the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty system does not mean negating peaceful coexistence with countries with different ideologies and political systems, nor does it make peaceful coexistence impossible. This can be proved by the fact that recently our country has accumulated good-neighborly relations with the Soviet Union in various fields, and Foreign Minister Shiina visited the Soviet Union for the first time as our country's Foreign Minister after the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union.
    In the recent international situation, the China issue has become increasingly important. For our country, which has had close relations with the Chinese nation since ancient times, it goes without saying that establishing a relationship of coexistence with the entire Chinese nation is a welcome thing.
    However, it must be admitted that as long as Communist China adopts a stubborn attitude like it does now and continues to adopt policies that may shut itself off and return to the international community, there will still be many difficulties in the development of the situation.
    The government intends to maintain the traditional friendly and good-neighborly relations with the Republic of China (中華民國 Zhōnghuá Mínguó), and at the same time, with Communist China, it will take the principle of non-interference in internal affairs as a prerequisite, see clearly where the national interests lie, and treat it cautiously.
    Among Asian countries, some are facing severe food and economic crises. As a member of Asia, our country should take the lead among the world's advanced countries to show warm understanding to these closest countries, and actively carry out cooperation and assistance to help improve this situation.
    At the end of last year, our country took the initiative to participate in the establishment of the Asian Development Bank, and in April, we will hold a Southeast Asian Development Ministerial Conference in Tokyo. These are all based on this spirit. In addition, we are prepared to study emergency assistance measures for Asian countries in urgent need of assistance and take practical and effective measures.
    Some time ago, the restoration of diplomatic relations with South Korea brought us bright hopes. I still intend to appeal to Asian friendly countries in the future, urging them to further implement cooperation in the spirit of mutual respect and mutual concession, which is the road to development and prosperity.

### 佐藤的施政演说（外交部分）

    佐藤的施政演说（外交部分）
    本报讯　据共同社东京二十八日电：日本首相佐藤一月二十八日在众议院全体会议上发表施政方针演说，其中有关外交部分的内容如下：
    我一直把坚持和平作为外交的基本方针，可是，实现真正和平的道路，是艰难险阻的。世界各国，从根本上说，不要只是固执于本国的主张，而要保持通过谈判设法解决问题的态度，并为此而进行坚持不懈的努力，才是实现真正和平的道路。
    在这个意义上，最紧急的问题，是和平解决越南争端。
    我得到机会听取关于美国的和平工作的详尽说明，当时我肯定地了解到，美国对于解决问题抱有灵活的想法，并且认真地寻求着和平。我强烈地希望属于北越政权和所谓民族解放阵线的人们不要错过这个实现和平的机会，而表示向和平接近的态度。
    政府一直呼吁北越等国的有关人士不要不理睬这种强烈的世界舆论，而要对于争取和平的谈判的呼吁，迅速表示积极的反应。但是，时至今日，还没有表现出令人满意的迹象，这是非常遗憾的。我现在再次促请有关国家自重，并且表明决心，不管今后情况怎样演变，都要继续作最大的努力，争取解决越南问题。
    如果考虑到，我国在第二十届联合国大会会议上被选为安全理事会理事国以后，在国际上的作用已经进一步增加了重要性，那就不能不说，争取和平的责任是非常重的。
    另一方面，在战后的世界形势下面，一个国家只靠自己显然是不能确保安全。象一部分人所说的那样，我国单方面废除日美安全条约，宣布中立，就能确保我国的安全的那种想法，是一个很大的幻想。我认为，保持日美安全条约体制，是为了确保我国的和平和安全的最现实的政策。
    保持日美安全条约体制，并不是要否定和不同意识形态和不同政治制度的国家的和平共处，也不是要使和平共处成为不可能。这可以由下述情况得到证明：最近我国同苏联在各方面都积累了睦邻关系，而且，椎名外务大臣在日苏邦交恢复后以我国外务大臣身份第一次访问了苏联。
    在近来的国际形势下，中国问题越来越重要了。对于自古以来就同中国民族有密切关系的我国来说，同整个中国民族建立共处关系这件事情是值得欢迎的，这是不必赘述的。
    但是，不能不承认，只要共产党中国象现在这样采取顽固的态度，继续采取可能自行关闭重新回到国际社会的大门的政策，那就对于事态的发展还会有许多困难。
    政府打算保持同中华民国之间历来的友好亲善关系，同时对于共产党中国，要以互不干涉内政为前提，看清国家利益所在，慎重地加以对待。
    在亚洲国家中间，有的国家正面临严重的粮食危机和经济危机。作为亚洲一员的我国，应该为世界先进国家带头，对最邻近的这些国家表示热情的理解，同时积极进行有助于改善这种现状的合作和援助。
    去年年底，我国主动地参加亚洲开发银行的建立，而且，还要在四月在东京召开东南亚开发部长会议，这些都是根据这种精神的。还有，对于急需援助的亚洲国家，准备研究紧急援助办法，采取切实有效的各项措施。
    前些时候，同韩国恢复邦交给我们带来了光明的希望。我今后仍然打算对亚洲的友邦发出呼吁，促请他们站在彼此尊重的立场上按照互让的精神进一步实行合作，这才是走向发展和繁荣的道路。
