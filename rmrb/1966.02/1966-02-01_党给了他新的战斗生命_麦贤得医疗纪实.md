    The Party Gave Him a New Fighting Life
    ——Medical Notes on Mai Xiande
    Millions of hearts are concerned about the recovery of the health of the hard-boned warrior Mai Xiande. Comrades, now, we are pleased to tell you: Mai Xiande, his vigorous fighting life, has completely overcome the threat of death; his health is also gradually recovering.
    The battle to seize life for Mai Xiande has been won.
    This is the Party and Chairman Mao giving him another fighting life!
    This is another paean to Mao Zedong Thought!
    August 17, 1965, Beijing, in the solemn Great Hall of the People, Chairman Mao and other leaders of the Party and the state, received the meritorious personnel of the "August 6th" naval battle.
    Premier Zhou asked with particular concern: "Wasn't there a turbine soldier who was seriously injured in the head and couldn't see, but insisted on fighting? How is he now?"
    Comrade Kong Zhaonian, who was being received, replied: "Yes, his name is Mai Xiande, and he is still unconscious."
    Vice Premier He Long asked: "Which hospital is he in?"
      "He is in ××× Hospital."
    Premier Zhou specially instructed: "Send doctors to rescue him, be sure to rescue him! Convey the greetings of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to the wounded comrades."
    The cordial concern of the Party and state leaders immediately turned into a huge force to rescue Mai Xiande.
    Swift radio waves, full of the concern and greetings of the Party and state leaders, flew to the front lines.
    Frontline somewhere.
    The Political Department of the unit where Mai Xiande was located set up a special working group to study measures to rescue Mai Xiande.
    The Party Committee of the local People's Hospital held an emergency meeting to convey the instructions from higher authorities.
    Spare no effort in rescue!
    Spare no effort in rescue!
    This is a common battle call. Lacking an X-ray machine, a certain health station quickly sent one over; not enough oxygen, the municipal machinery department immediately transferred the oxygen used in production and sent it. Medical students who were taking their graduation exams also rushed to join the rescue...
    During the operation, Mai Xiande suddenly went into shock. "Immediate blood transfusion!" A low voice came from the operating room, immediately turning into a silent command. Doctor Ke Chengyao immediately requested to donate his own blood. He had recently suffered from bronchitis, and the leadership considered having someone else donate, but he firmly said: "Time is of the essence, my body can handle it, hurry!"
    Intern nurse Huang Youyun hurriedly ran over and said: "I have type O blood, transfuse mine."
    ...In an instant, the medical staff swarmed up, lining up outside the operating room. Everyone had the most earnest desire: "Transfuse mine!"
      "Heal the wounded and rescue the dying, practice revolutionary humanitarianism." Chairman Mao's words resonated in people's hearts.
    Two thousand CCs of the blood of class brothers strengthened Mai Xiande's vitality.
    Mai Xiande's heroic behavior in the naval battle brought so much encouragement to the medical staff! They were determined to take back Mai Xiande's fighting life from the enemy, everyone worked meticulously and cared carefully, working more than twelve hours a day. Comrade Chai Huaixiang, the fifty-year-old vice president of the hospital, stayed up all night during the tense moment of rescue, until the danger was over. Doctors Zhang Weiguang, Lin Youguang, and others slept in the ward at night, observing and grasping the changes in the condition at any time, and insisted on three consultations every day. The nurses were even more inseparable, working day and night, carefully taking care of him. Nurse Huang Kunmei was ill, and the leadership had already approved her semi-vacation, but she insisted on working. She said: "The People's Liberation Army comrades bravely fight the enemy for the Party, for the motherland, and for the people, shedding blood, can't I spend some effort to restore their health?" When Mai Xiande couldn't eat, she used a soft rubber tube to slowly send the cake protein into his stomach. When Mai Xiande had difficulty defecating, she used her fingers to dig it out little by little.
    Under the rescue and care of class brothers, Mai Xiande's condition stabilized.
    The Guangzhou Military Region General Hospital accepted the task of further treating Mai Xiande.
    In the blue sky of the motherland, an airplane carrying Mai Xiande, flew through the white clouds, straight to Guangzhou.
    Zhou Zhengwei, the Political Commissar of Guangzhou Military Region General Hospital, and Vice President An, personally carried the stretcher, carrying Mai Xiande from the plane to the car, and then from the car to the ward. The hospital party committee held an emergency meeting for the treatment of Mai Xiande, the secretary of the hospital party committee said firmly: "We must resolutely implement the instructions of the Party and state leaders, we must take the heroic warriors as an example, not afraid of any difficulties, wholeheartedly rescue the heroic warriors' lives, so that he can recover his health as soon as possible and return to the combat post."
    The special care group for nursing Mai Xiande was composed of excellent personnel. The best room was vacated and thoroughly disinfected.
    The General Hospital made all preparations.
    The comrades of the special care group, shouldering the hopes of the Party and the people of the motherland, were determined to work wholeheartedly to rescue class brothers. They hired famous medical experts and professors in the Guangzhou area for consultation, and also invited experts from Beijing, Shenyang, Xi'an, Shanghai and other places for telephone consultation, and gave Mai Xiande correct and timely treatment.
    Liu Mingduo, director of neurosurgery, often worked until eleven or twelve o'clock. In one operation, he worked continuously on the operating table for more than nine hours, without eating, drinking, or resting. Someone asked him: "Director Liu, you are already in your fifties, are you tired from such a big operation?" Director Liu said: "When I think of the Party and the people's concern for him, when I think of Premier Zhou's instructions, when I think of Mai Xiande's heroic spirit of fighting the enemy bravely, I don't feel tired at all."
    Nurse Li Jin'ai voluntarily gave up her vacation to visit her lover, staying with Mai Xiande day and night, carefully observing any slight changes in him. Once, Mai Xiande sat up from the bed and had a little runny nose. This was originally a small matter that was not easily noticed, but it aroused Li Jin'ai's attention. She and the comrades of the nursing team carefully studied it, and asked the laboratory to test it, and the result was that it was found to be cerebrospinal fluid leakage. The doctor immediately took effective measures to prevent the risk of meningitis in time.
    Mai Xiande's injury gradually improved. When he was able to move, the medical staff took him to study Chairman Mao's quotations, practice walking, practice writing, arithmetic and singing. Whenever Mai Xiande's physical and mental recovery made a little progress, especially when he could write "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!", could study Chairman Mao's quotations, could sing "The East is Red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong..." the medical staff felt infinite happiness and joy.
              ×××
    Mai Xiande has gained a new fighting life. In those countless days and nights of fighting for his new fighting life, what power supported people to carry out selfless battle? It is the power of Mao Zedong Thought, the concern of the Party and state leaders and leaders at all levels, and the letters of condolences sent from all over the motherland across thousands of mountains and rivers. It is these that convey firm belief, tenacious perseverance, and infinite wisdom to the medical staff and to Mai Xiande.
    In order to prepare for future battles, in order to meet more severe tests, Mai Xiande is exercising with the help of medical staff. They know that the motherland's ocean is waiting for its warriors!

    党给了他新的战斗生命
    ——麦贤得医疗纪实
    千万颗心都在关怀着硬骨头战士麦贤得恢复健康的情况。同志们，现在，我们欣喜地告诉大家：麦贤得，他那旺盛的战斗生命，已经完全战胜了死亡的威胁；他的健康也在逐步恢复。
    为麦贤得夺取生命的战斗胜利了。
    这是党和毛主席给了他又一次战斗生命！
    这是又一曲毛泽东思想的凯歌！
    一九六五年八月十七日，北京，庄严的人民大会堂里，毛主席同党和国家的其他领导人，接见“八六”海战的有功人员。
    周总理特别关切地问：“这次不是有一个轮机兵，头部负了重伤，看不见，还一直坚持战斗，现在怎么样？”
    被接见的孔照年同志回答：“是的，他叫麦贤得，现在还昏迷不醒。”
    贺龙副总理问：“他在什么医院？”
      “在×××医院。”
    周总理特别嘱咐：“要派医生去抢救，一定要抢救！你们向伤员同志传达党中央、毛主席对他们的问候。”
    党和国家领导人的亲切关怀，立即变成抢救麦贤得的巨大力量。
    飞速的电波，满载着党和国家领导人的关切和问候，飞向前线。    
    前线某地。
    麦贤得所在部队政治部专门成立工作组，研究了抢救麦贤得的措施。
    当地人民医院的党委召开了紧急会议，传达了上级的指示。
    全力抢救！
    全力抢救！
    这是共同的战斗号角。缺一台X光机，某保健站很快送过来；氧气不大够用，市机械部门立刻把生产上用的氧气抽调送来。正在举行结业考试的医专学生也赶来投入抢救……。
    手术中，麦贤得突然出现休克。“立即输血！”手术室里传出一句低沉的声音，立刻化作一道无声的命令。医生柯成耀，马上要求输自己的血。他最近患气管炎，领导上考虑要别人输，他坚决地说：“时间要紧，我的身体吃得住，快！”
    实习护士黄幼云，急忙跑来说：“我是O型血，输我的。”
    ……刹时，医护人员们蜂拥而上，列队在手术室外。人人怀着最殷切的愿望：“输我的！”
      “救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义。”毛主席的话震响在人们的心头。
    两千CC阶级兄弟鲜红的血液，增强了麦贤得的生命力。
    麦贤得在海战中的英雄行为给医护人员们带来了多么大的鼓舞啊！他（她）们决心从敌人手里夺回麦贤得的战斗生命，个个经心工作，细心护理，每天都工作十二小时以上。五十岁的医院副院长柴怀祥同志，在抢救的紧张时刻，通宵守候，直到脱险为止。医生张巍光、林有光等夜里睡在病房，随时观察掌握病情变化，每天坚持三次会诊。护士更是寸步不离，废寝忘食，细心看护。护士长黄琨美身体有病，领导已经批准她半休，可是她一直坚持工作。她说：“解放军同志为党、为祖国、为人民英勇杀敌，流了鲜血，难道我不能为他们恢复健康花费点心血吗？”麦贤得不能吃饭，她就用软胶管把糕蛋白缓缓地送到他胃里。麦贤得大便有困难，她就用手指一点点挖出来。
    在阶级兄弟的抢救护理下，麦贤得的伤情稳定下来了。
    广州部队总医院接受了进一步治疗麦贤得的任务。
    祖国蓝天上，一架载着麦贤得的飞机，穿过朵朵白云，直飞广州。
    广州部队总医院周政委和安副院长，亲自抬担架，把麦贤得从飞机抬上汽车，又从汽车抬进病房。医院党委为治疗麦贤得而召开了紧急会议，院党委书记坚定地说：“我们要坚决贯彻执行党和国家领导人的指示，一定要以英雄战士为榜样，不怕任何困难，全心全意抢救英雄战士的生命，使他早日恢复健康，重返战斗岗位。”
    护理麦贤得的特护小组，挑选优秀的人员组成。把最好的房间腾出来，彻底消毒。
    总医院做好了一切准备。
    特护小组的同志，肩负着党和祖国人民的希望，下定决心一心一意为抢救阶级兄弟而努力。他们聘请了广州地区有名的医学专家和教授会诊，又请北京、沈阳、西安、上海等地专家进行电话会诊，对麦贤得进行了正确及时的治疗。
    脑外科主任刘明铎，经常工作到十一二点钟。在一次手术时，他连续在手术台工作九个多小时，不吃饭，不喝水，不休息。有人问他：“刘主任，你已经五十多岁了，动这样大的手术累不累呀？”刘主任说：“想起了党和人民对他的关怀，想起了周总理的指示，想起了麦贤得奋勇杀敌的英雄气概，我就一点也不知疲劳了。”
    护士长李金爱主动放弃了探望爱人的假期，夜以继日地守候着麦贤得，细心地观察他的任何微小的变化。一次，麦贤得从床上坐起来，流了一点鼻涕，本来这是一件不易被人注意的小事，却引起了李金爱的重视。她和护理小组同志认真研究，又请化验室化验，结果查清是脑脊液流漏。医生马上采取有效措施，及时防止了引起脑膜炎的危险。
    麦贤得伤势渐渐好起来。当他能活动时，医护人员就带着他学毛主席语录，练走路，练习写字，演算术和唱歌。每当麦贤得的体力和智力的恢复有了一点进步，特别看到他能用手写“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”，能学毛主席语录，能唱“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”时，医护人员都感到无限的幸福和高兴。
              ×××
    麦贤得获得了新的战斗生命。在那些为他争夺新的战斗生命的无数个日日夜夜里，是什么力量支持人们进行忘我战斗的呢？是毛泽东思想的威力，是党和国家领导人以及各级首长的关怀，还有那跨千山，涉万水，从祖国各地寄来的慰问信，就是这些，把坚定的信念、顽强的毅力、无穷的智慧输送给医护人员，输送给麦贤得。
    为了准备未来的战斗，为了迎接更严峻的考验，麦贤得在医护人员帮助下锻炼着，锻炼着。他们知道，祖国的海洋期待着自己的战士！
