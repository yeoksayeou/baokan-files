　　According to Xinhua News Agency on the 24th, some teachers from the Thermal Engineering Teaching and Research Group of the Department of Power Machinery at Tsinghua University, along with some students from the same department, creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and together with the staff of a chemical fertilizer plant in Sichuan, carried out a revolutionary transformation of the key equipment in China's existing nitrogen fertilizer plants—the ammonia synthesis tower. The production capacity of the transformed ammonia synthesis tower has increased by 70% compared to the past. Recently, they summarized their experience and deeply realized that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful spiritual weapon. Arming people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought can lead to victory in conquering scientific and technological peaks.
　　This teaching and research group is a teaching unit mainly focused on researching basic technical theories. In 1963, under the leadership of the Party organization, they studied Chairman Mao's works such as "On Practice" and systematically summarized the experience and lessons learned in carrying out scientific research. Through study and discussion, everyone clarified that scientific research must be oriented towards production and serve production, and that science can only develop in the struggle to transform reality. After the understanding was clear, more than fifty people from the teaching and research group went to relevant departments, factories, and design institutions outside the school to conduct investigations and research. They found that the technology of China's existing ammonia synthesis towers was relatively backward and the output was low. The main problem was the poor heat transfer in the ammonia synthesis towers, but solving the heat transfer problem involved many chemical knowledge they were not familiar with. Faced with this difficulty, the idea of serving production wavered in the minds of a few individuals, who believed that engaging in chemical problems while studying thermal engineering would abandon their own specialties and be detrimental to the development of their profession. With this issue in mind, everyone studied Chairman Mao's expositions on serving the people, and their views changed. They realized that China's fertilizer production could not meet the needs of agricultural development, and in order to produce more fertilizer, they must break through the barrier of lacking chemical knowledge. Things are always transforming; diligent practice and diligent study can turn the incomprehensible into the comprehensible, the unknowing into the knowing, and the amateur into the professional.
　　At the beginning of the ammonia synthesis tower transformation, they saw a new type of synthesis tower with a very complex internal structure in foreign magazines, which had a much higher daily output than the old towers that accounted for the majority in China at that time. At that time, some people believed that it was impossible for these old towers from the 1940s to catch up with the new towers of the 1960s. At this time, they once again studied Chairman Mao's works, established the idea of "breaking superstitions, daring to think and daring to act," and used the viewpoint of "one divides into two" to analyze favorable and unfavorable conditions. The results of the analysis showed that our favorable conditions were: we have a superior socialist system, we have the great Mao Zedong Thought as guidance, and we have the revolutionary spirit and creative spirit of the broad masses. These are the most fundamental and long-term factors. Unfavorable conditions are a late start, backward technology, and a lack of chemical knowledge, but these are all non-fundamental and temporary factors. Lacking chemical knowledge, we can rely on the masses and seek advice from those who are capable. A late start and backward technology, as long as we are unwilling to lag behind and make full use of favorable conditions to catch up quickly, unfavorable conditions can be transformed. Once the spiritual shackles are broken and the mind is liberated, revolutionary enthusiasm will be boosted. Then came the question of whether to build a new tower or reform the old tower. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's idea of proceeding from reality, they further clarified after discussion that scientific research should serve production and be based on China's specific situation and actual needs. The current production in China uses old towers, and reforming old towers is currently a path to increase synthetic ammonia production in a faster, better, and more economical way.
　　At the beginning of the technical transformation of the synthesis tower, some people saw some solutions to heat transfer problems in foreign magazines and imitated them. After working for several months without success, they took a detour. At this time, they once again studied "On Practice" and realized that they must use Chairman Mao's dialectical materialism as guidance to conduct in-depth investigation and research on the object of transformation—the ammonia synthesis tower.
　　Therefore, they sent three teachers to some chemical fertilizer plants to work as interns to understand the production object and used thermal engineering knowledge to conduct theoretical analysis of the heat transfer process inside the synthesis tower. Finally, they found the main contradiction and designed a new component. The chemical fertilizer plant adopted this plan and carried out the first technical transformation of the synthesis tower. However, although the heat transfer performance of the transformed tower was very good, the effect of increasing production was not obvious. They conducted technical summaries again and found that the reason was that while the original contradiction was solved, a new contradiction was produced. After using the new component, heat generation could not keep up, hindering the increase in production. Therefore, they and the workers jointly created a set of operating methods that adapted to the new components, which made the synthesis tower achieve a significant increase in production. The second transformation was successful, and some people developed complacency. In response to this state of mind, they studied Chairman Mao's instruction that "the history of mankind is a history of continuous development from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom." They were determined to continuously make revolution, further analyze and explore the working rules of the synthesis tower, and found that the new component still had shortcomings. After mass research and breaking through several barriers, they finally realized the third technical transformation. The daily production capacity of a single tower was further improved.
　　The teachers and students who participated in the ammonia synthesis tower transformation this time also followed Chairman Mao's teaching that intellectuals must combine with workers and peasants. Whether they were associate professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, or young students and graduate students, they lived in the same dormitory as the workers and insisted on participating in labor, learning from the workers, and popularizing basic theoretical knowledge to the workers. Everyone realized that the combination of intellectuals and workers, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought creatively, is a correct path to quickly overcome technical bottlenecks.

　　清华热工学教研组师生改造氨合成塔经验再次证明
　　毛泽东思想是攻占科技高峰的强大武器
　　知识分子同工人结合是迅速解决技术关键的正确道路科学研究只有面向生产在变革现实的斗争中才能发展
    据新华社二十四日讯　清华大学动力机械系热工学教研组的一些教师和这个系的一些学生活学活用毛主席著作，同四川一个化工厂职工一道，对我国现有的氮肥厂的关键设备——氨合成塔进行了革命性的改造。改造后的氨合成塔，生产能力比过去提高了百分之七十。最近，他们总结了经验，深刻地体会到毛泽东思想是最强大的精神武器，用毛泽东思想武装了人的头脑，就可以战无不胜地攻占科学技术高峰。
    这个教研组是以研究技术基础理论为主的教学单位。一九六三年，他们在党组织的领导下，学习了毛主席的《实践论》等有关著作，系统地总结了开展科学研究工作的经验和教训。通过学习讨论，大家明确了科学研究必须面向生产，为生产服务，只有在变革现实的斗争中，科学才能得到发展。认识明确后，教研组里前后有五十多人次分别到校外有关部门、工厂和设计机关进行调查研究，发现我国现有的氨合成塔技术比较落后，产量低，其中主要问题是氨合成塔的传热不好，但要解决氨合成塔的传热问题，牵涉到很多他们不熟悉的化工知识。面对着这个困难，个别人为生产服务的思想又动摇了，认为学热工的搞化工的问题会放弃自己的特长，对专业的发展不利。带着这个问题，大家学习了毛主席为人民服务的论述，看法变了。他们认识到，我国的化肥生产不能满足农业发展的需要，为了多产化肥，一定要突破缺少化工知识这一关。事物总是转化的，努力实践，努力学习，可以使不懂变为懂，无知识变为有知识，外行变成内行。
    在开始改造氨合成塔时，他们从外国杂志中看到国外有一种内部结构很复杂的新型合成塔，日产量比当时国内数量上占多数的老塔高得多。当时有人认为，这种四十年代的老塔要赶上六十年代的新塔是不可能的。这时，他们就再一次学习毛主席著作，树立“破除迷信，敢想敢干”的思想，并用一分为二的观点，分析有利和不利条件。分析的结果，大家认为，我们的有利条件是：有优越的社会主义制度，有伟大的毛泽东思想作指导，有广大群众的革命精神和创造精神。这些是最根本的、长远起作用的因素。不利条件是起点晚，技术落后，又缺少化工知识，但是这些都是非根本的、暂时的因素。缺乏化工知识，可以依靠群众，向能者求教。起点晚，技术落后，只要不甘于落后，充分利用有利条件急起直追，不利条件是可以转化的。精神枷锁打碎了，思想解放了，革命劲头也就鼓起来了。接着产生了一个建新塔还是改老塔的问题。在毛主席的从实际出发的思想指导下，他们经过讨论，进一步明确了科学研究为生产服务，要立足于我国的具体情况和实际需要。我国当前生产中用的都是老塔，改造老塔在当前是一条多快好省增产合成氨的途径。
    在对合成塔进行技术改造的开始，有些人从外国杂志上看到一些解决传热问题的办法，就如法炮制，搞了几个月没有成功，走了一段弯路。这时，他们再一次学习了《实践论》，认识到，必须应用毛主席的辩证唯物主义思想作指导，对改造对象——氨合成塔作深入的调查研究。
    于是他们派了三位教师到一些化工厂跟班实习，了解生产对象，并运用热工知识对合成塔内的传热过程进行理论分析，终于找出了主要矛盾，设计了一种新部件。化工厂采纳了这项方案，进行了合成塔的第一次技术改造。但是，经过改造的塔，传热性能虽然很好，增产效果并不明显。他们又进行技术总结，发现原因在于解决了原来的矛盾，却又产生了新矛盾。使用新部件后，发热跟不上，妨碍了增产。于是，他们又和工人一起创造出一套与新部件相适应的操作方法，使合成塔获得了显著的增产效果。第二次改造成功了，有些人产生了自满情绪。针对这种思想状态，他们又学习毛主席的“人类的历史，就是一个不断地从必然王国向自由王国发展的历史”的指示。他们决心不断革命，进一步分析探索合成塔的工作规律，发现新部件还有缺点。经过群众性的钻研，闯过几道关口，终于又实现了第三次技术改造。单塔日产能力进一步提高。
    这次到工厂参加氨合成塔改造的师生还遵循毛主席关于知识分子必须和工农结合的教导，不论是副教授、讲师、助教，还是年轻的学生、研究生，都和工人住在一个宿舍里，并坚持参加劳动，向工人学习，还向工人普及基本理论知识。大家体会到，知识分子和工人结合活学活用毛泽东思想，是迅速攻克技术关键的一条正确道路。
