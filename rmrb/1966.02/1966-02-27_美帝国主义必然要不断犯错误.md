　　American Imperialism is Bound to Make Mistakes Constantly
　　He Jiang
    Imperialism and all reactionaries always make mistakes constantly and repeatedly. American imperialism is even more so.
    "U.S. News & World Report" recently republished a memoir by Ridgway, the former commander of the American forces who invaded Korea and commander-in-chief of the "United Nations Forces." This loser at the hands of the Chinese and Korean people lost over 300,000 troops in just fourteen months as commander-in-chief. In this memoir, he tried to summarize the "painful lessons" of the Korean War as someone who had been there, and boasted that he had opposed U.S. involvement in the Indochina War in 1954, to show that he was extremely wise.
    "U.S. News & World Report" probably wanted to show that Ridgway was quite insightful by publishing this memoir at this moment. In fact, as long as people read this article, they will find that Ridgway has not drawn any real lessons from the failure of the Korean War. His views on the Indochina War in 1954 did not grasp the essence of the problem. Therefore, Ridgway still believes today that the United States can achieve something in the Vietnam War. It can be seen that Ridgway is no more brilliant than the likes of Johnson and McNamara. In fact, neither Ridgway nor Johnson and McNamara can learn any lessons from mistakes.
    The American ruling group once called the Korean War "the wrong war, at the wrong time, in the wrong place, with the wrong enemy." In his memoir, Ridgway expressed his rejoicing that the United States did not participate in the Indochina War in 1954. He said, "Thank God, that mistake (referring to the Korean War) was not repeated." However, after a few years, the American invading army threw itself into the South Vietnam battlefield and made mistakes again, and is preparing to make even bigger mistakes.
    Why do imperialism and reactionaries, especially American imperialism, always make mistakes constantly and repeatedly?
    All declining classes and decaying forces always overestimate their own strength and underestimate the strength of the people. They always see the role of things, but not the role of people. In the eyes of American imperialism, it has nuclear weapons, tens of thousands of tons of steel, thousands of planes, and all kinds of new killing weapons, so it thinks it is very great. It cannot see the human factor in war, the fighting will of the revolutionary people. Ridgway thought he was more clever than his colleagues, but in fact, his investigation report on the situation in Indochina in 1954 was a typical example of seeing things but not people.
    Precisely because of this, imperialism and all reactionaries cannot possibly recognize the laws of the objective world, let alone grasp them. As the world's reactionary fortress and international gendarme, American imperialism takes it as its duty to strangle the revolutionary movements of people in various countries, and tries to obstruct the development of the historical trend. But what is the result? In the past twenty years, it has not and cannot prevent the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, it has not and cannot prevent the victory of the Korean people's revolutionary war, and it has not and cannot prevent the development and victory of the revolutionary struggles of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Today, it can absolutely not prevent the final victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. As early as more than a decade ago, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The present era is one in which capitalism and imperialism throughout the world are heading for their doom and socialism and people's democracy are heading for victory." American imperialism vainly attempts to block the great historical trend, how can it not make mistakes?
    Imperialism and all reactionaries make mistakes again and again until their demise, which has become their law. Napoleon ambitiously tried to conquer Europe and conquer the world, but made a big mistake and ended in complete failure. Hitler did not accept, nor could he accept, Napoleon's lessons, and again wanted to conquer Europe and conquer the world, and as a result, he made the same mistake and similarly ended in complete failure. Now, American imperialism has neither accepted the lessons of its predecessors nor accepted its own lessons, and is making one mistake after another, each more serious than the last, until it walks into its grave.

### 美帝国主义必然要不断犯错误

　　美帝国主义必然要不断犯错误
　　何江
    帝国主义和一切反动派，总是不断地、重复地犯错误。美帝国主义更是如此。
    《美国新闻与世界报道》最近重新发表了前侵朝美军头目、“联合国军”总司令李奇微的一篇回忆录。这个朝中人民的手下败将，在担任总司令仅仅十四个月内，就损兵折将三十余万人。在这篇回忆录里，他以过来人的身份，试图总结一下侵朝战争中的“惨痛教训”，并吹嘘他在一九五四年时曾经反对美国参与印度支那战争，以表明自己是极为明智的。
    《美国新闻与世界报道》在此时此刻发表这篇回忆录，大概想表明李奇微是颇有见识的。其实，人们只要读一下他的这篇文章，就会发现李奇微并没有从侵朝战争的失败中得出什么真正的教训。他对一九五四年印度支那战争的一些看法，也并没有抓住问题的本质。因而，李奇微今天还是认为美国在侵越战争中是可以有所作为的。可见，李奇微并不比约翰逊、麦克纳马拉之流有什么高明之处。事实上，李奇微也好，约翰逊和麦克纳马拉也好，都不可能从错误中接受什么教训。
    美国统治集团曾经把侵朝战争称之为“在错误的时间，错误的地点，同错误的敌人，进行错误的战争。”李奇微在回忆录中，对于一九五四年美国没有参与印度支那战争表示庆幸。他说：“感谢上帝，那个错误（指侵朝战争）没有重犯。”可是，事隔数年，美国侵略军投入了南越战场，又犯起错误来了，并且正在准备犯更大的错误。
    帝国主义和反动派，特别是美帝国主义，为什么总是不断地、重复地犯错误呢？
    一切没落的阶级和腐朽力量，总是过高估计自己的力量，过低估计人民的力量的。他们总是看到物的作用，而看不到人的作用。在美帝国主义看来，它手里有核武器，有成万吨钢铁，有成千上万架飞机，有各种各样的新式杀人武器，就以为自己很了不起。对战争中的人的因素，对革命的人民的斗争意志，它是看不到的。李奇微自以为比他的同僚高明，其实，他在一九五四年对印度支那情况所作的调查报告，就是一个见物不见人的典型。
    正是因为这样，帝国主义和一切反动派，根本不可能认识客观世界的规律，更谈不上掌握这个规律。作为全世界的反动堡垒和国际宪兵的美帝国主义，以扼杀各国人民革命运动的刽子手为己任，力图阻挠历史潮流的发展。但是，结果又如何呢？在过去二十年中，它并没有也不可能阻止中国人民革命的胜利，并没有也不可能阻止朝鲜人民革命战争的胜利，并没有也不可能阻止亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民革命斗争的发展和胜利。今天，它也绝对无法阻止越南人民抗美救国斗争的最后胜利。早在十几年前，毛泽东同志就指出：“现在是全世界资本主义和帝国主义走向灭亡，全世界社会主义和人民民主主义走向胜利的历史时代”。美帝国主义妄图阻挡伟大的历史潮流，它怎么能不犯错误呢？
    帝国主义和一切反动派，一次又一次地犯错误，直到它们的灭亡，这已成为它们的规律。拿破仑野心勃勃地妄图征服欧洲、征服世界，结果犯了一个大错误，以彻底的失败而告终。希特勒没有接受、也不可能接受拿破仑的教训，再次想征服欧洲，征服世界，结果犯了同样的错误，同样地以彻底失败而告终。现在，美帝国主义既没有接受它前辈的教训，也没有接受它自己的教训，正在接二连三地犯着一个比一个严重的错误，直到走进它的坟墓。
