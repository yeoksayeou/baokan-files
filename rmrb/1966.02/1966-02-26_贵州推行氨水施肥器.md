    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang – Guizhou Province is promoting an ammonia water fertilizer applicator in rural areas. This fertilizer tool was newly manufactured by the Duyun County Agricultural Machinery Repair Plant.
    With the development of ammonia water production, more and more rural areas in the mountainous regions of Guizhou have begun to use ammonia water fertilizer. Ammonia water has a pungent odor and is corrosive, and it evaporates easily. Using an ammonia water fertilizer applicator to apply ammonia water can prevent harm to farmers' bodies; at the same time, because this applicator can inject ammonia water directly into the soil and automatically cover it with soil, it can avoid ammonia water from evaporating.
    This ammonia water fertilizer applicator has a simple structure, is easy to operate, weighs only about two kilograms, is easy to carry in mountainous areas, and its fertilization efficiency is about five times higher than manual watering.

    贵州推行氨水施肥器
    新华社贵阳电　贵州农村正在推广一种氨水施肥器。这种施肥工具是都匀县农业机械修配厂新制成的。
    随着氨水生产的发展，贵州山区越来越多的农村开始使用氨水肥料。氨水有臭味和腐蚀性，并且容易挥发。采取氨水施肥器施用氨水，可以防止氨水对农民身体的侵害；同时由于这种施肥器能把氨水直接注入土内，并且能自动盖土，因此可以避免氨水挥发。
    这种氨水施肥器结构简单，操作轻便，重量只有两公斤左右，便于山区携带，施肥效率约比人工浇施高五倍。
