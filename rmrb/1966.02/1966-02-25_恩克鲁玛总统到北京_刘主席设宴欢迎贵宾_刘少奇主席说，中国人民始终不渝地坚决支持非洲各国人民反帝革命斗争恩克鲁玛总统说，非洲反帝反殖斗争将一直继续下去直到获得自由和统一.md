　　Xinhua News Agency, February 24th. Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, President of the Republic of Ghana, arrived in Beijing by special plane this afternoon.

　　Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other state leaders, as well as thousands of people from all walks of life in the capital, went to the airport to welcome the distinguished guest.

　　Among the Ghanaian government officials accompanying President Nkrumah on his visit were Foreign Minister A. Quaison-Sackey, Minister of Foreign Trade Kwesi Armah, and others.

　　Greeting the distinguished guest at the airport were also Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gao Chongmin and Xu Deheng, President of the Supreme People's Court Yang Xiufeng, Vice Foreign Minister Ji Pengfei, and others.

　　A welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The band played the national anthems of Ghana and China, and a 21-gun salute was fired. President Nkrumah, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai, reviewed the guard of honor of the three services of the People's Liberation Army. Children presented flowers to President Nkrumah and other Ghanaian guests.

　　When President Nkrumah, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai, met with the welcoming crowds, drums and applause rang out from the crowd. People waved ribbons and bouquets, shouting "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Ghanaian people!" and "Long live the solidarity of the Asian and African people!"

　　Today, colorful flags and the national flags of China and Ghana were hung along East and West Chang'an Avenue in the capital. Portraits of President Nkrumah were erected at intersections, and welcoming banners were hung high in the sky above the streets.

　　Also present at the airport to welcome the guests today were heads of various government departments, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, people's organizations, democratic parties, and the Beijing Municipality.

　　Ghanaian Ambassador to China Bedu-Addo Poku and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China, as well as African friends in Beijing, also went to the airport to greet the President.

　　Xinhua News Agency, February 24th. Chairman Liu Shaoqi hosted a banquet in the Great Hall of the People tonight to warmly welcome Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, President of the Republic of Ghana.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai attended the banquet. Accompanying Chairman Liu at the banquet were Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gao Chongmin and Xu Deheng, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Cai Tingkai, President of the Supreme People's Court Yang Xiufeng, Vice Foreign Ministers Liu Xiao and Ji Pengfei, and others.

　　Ghanaian Foreign Minister A. Quaison-Sackey, Minister of Foreign Trade Kwesi Armah, and others who accompanied President Nkrumah on his visit were also invited to attend the banquet.

　　Chairman Liu spoke at the banquet. He said that the mutual visits of leaders of China and Ghana mark the continuous development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. He wished the Republic of Ghana greater achievements in all aspects in the future.

　　Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that most African countries have achieved independence. However, the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the African people has not ended and must be carried out even more thoroughly. Imperialism headed by the United States is intensifying its pursuit of neo-colonialist policies, attempting to subvert independent African countries and strangle the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the African people. He said that no matter how imperialism stirs up reactionary currents, the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the African people can never be extinguished and is bound to achieve final victory. The Chinese people always stand unswervingly on the side of the African people and resolutely support their just struggle. (The full text of the speech is on page two.)

　　President Nkrumah then spoke. He pointed out that the current struggle of Africa against imperialism and old and new colonialism is being further strengthened. This struggle in Africa will continue until Africa achieves freedom and unity, and joins hands with the progressive forces of the world to make the world a place where peace is guaranteed.

　　He also said that Africa's struggle is closely linked to the struggles of other countries for freedom and independence. Therefore, Asian-African solidarity must be strengthened, and if it is not strengthened, we cannot defeat the reactionary forces, imperialism, and neo-colonialism. He pointed out that solid and strong Asian-African solidarity can make a great contribution to world peace and security. (The full text of the speech is on page two.)

　　Also attending the banquet were heads of various government departments, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, various people's organizations, various democratic parties, and the Beijing Municipality.

    新华社二十四日讯　加纳共和国总统克瓦米·恩克鲁玛博士今天下午乘专机到达北京。
    刘少奇主席、周恩来总理等国家领导人以及首都各界数千人，前往机场欢迎贵宾。
    随同恩克鲁玛总统前来访问的加纳政府官员中，有外交部长阿·奎森—萨基、对外贸易部长奎西·阿马赫等。
    在机场上迎接贵宾的，还有薄一波副总理，郭沫若、林枫副委员长，政协全国委员会副主席高崇民、许德珩，最高人民法院院长杨秀峰，外交部副部长姬鹏飞等。
    机场上举行了欢迎仪式。乐队奏加纳、中国两国国歌，鸣礼炮二十一响。恩克鲁玛总统由刘少奇主席、周恩来总理陪同检阅陆海空三军仪仗队。少年儿童向恩克鲁玛总统和其他加纳贵宾献鲜花。
    当恩克鲁玛总统在刘少奇主席、周恩来总理陪同下同欢迎群众见面的时候，人群中响起锣鼓声和掌声，人们挥舞着彩带和花束，高呼“中国、加纳人民友好万岁”、“亚非人民团结万岁”。
    今天，首都东西长安街上悬挂着彩旗和中加两国的国旗，路口竖立着恩克鲁玛总统的画像，大街上空高悬着欢迎贵宾的横幅标语。
    今天前往机场欢迎的，还有政府各部门、中国人民解放军、人民团体、民主党派和北京市的负责人。
    加纳驻中国大使贝迪亚科·波库和各国驻中国使节，以及在京的非洲朋友，也到机场迎接。
    新华社二十四日讯　刘少奇主席今晚在人民大会堂举行宴会，热烈欢迎加纳共和国总统克瓦米·恩克鲁玛博士。
    周恩来总理出席了宴会。出席宴会作陪的，还有薄一波副总理，郭沫若、林枫副委员长，政协全国委员会副主席高崇民、许德珩，国防委员会副主席蔡廷锴，最高人民法院院长杨秀峰，外交部副部长刘晓、姬鹏飞等。
    随同恩克鲁玛总统来访的加纳外交部长阿·奎森—萨基、对外贸易部长奎西·阿马赫等也应邀出席了宴会。
    刘主席在宴会上讲话。他说，中加两国领导人的相互访问，标志着两国友好合作关系的不断发展。他祝愿加纳共和国今后在各个方面取得更大的成就。
    刘少奇主席说，非洲大多数国家已经取得独立。但是，非洲各国人民的反帝革命斗争并没有结束，还必须更加深入地进行这种斗争。以美国为首的帝国主义，正在变本加厉地推行新殖民主义政策，力图颠覆非洲独立国家，扼杀非洲各国人民的反帝革命斗争。他说，不论帝国主义怎样掀起反动逆流，非洲各国人民的反帝革命斗争是永远扑灭不了的，是一定要取得最后胜利的。中国人民始终不渝地站在非洲人民一边，坚决支持他们的正义斗争。（讲话全文见第二版）
    恩克鲁玛总统接着讲话。他指出，目前非洲反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争是更加加强了。非洲的这一斗争将一直继续下去，直到非洲获得自由和统一，并且同全世界的进步力量携起手来，使世界成为一个和平有保障的地方。
    他还说，非洲的斗争同其他争取自由和独立的国家的斗争是紧紧相连的。因此，亚非团结必须设法加强，如果不加强，我们就不能战胜反动势力、帝国主义和新殖民主义。他指出，坚实有力的亚非团结，能够对世界和平与安全作出很大的贡献。（讲话全文见第二版）
    出席宴会的，还有政府各部门、中国人民解放军、各人民团体、各民主党派和北京市的负责人。
