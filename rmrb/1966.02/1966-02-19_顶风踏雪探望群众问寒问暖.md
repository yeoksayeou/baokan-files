    Wuhu Prefecture and Kunshan County Cadres Study Jiao Yulu Through Practical Actions
    Visiting the Masses in the Snow, Asking About Their Well-being
    Kunshan County's sixty-five-year-old fisherman, Yin Chenzhi, said with tears in his eyes: "In the old society, I held my child and braved the wind and snow to beg for food; today, with such heavy snow, you still come to my boat to care for us so much. We must thank Chairman Mao for this!"
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, February 18th) Recently, a heavy snow fell in the Wuhu Prefecture of Anhui Province, along the Yangtze River. Many cadres who have studied the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, including many county party secretaries and county heads, have, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, braved the wind and snow to go to production teams, study production with the masses, and care about the lives of the masses. Pang Xitian, Secretary of the Langxi County Party Committee, after the snow, on the one hand, had the office cadres call each commune to pay attention to arranging production; on the other hand, he led a group of cadres to the production teams and water conservancy construction sites to understand the production and living conditions of the masses. He also led cadres to sweep snow on the spillway of the reservoir under construction, and organized the workers to repair twelve soil transportation roads, creating conditions for an early start after the snow. The cadres who went to the Lijiacun Brigade of Chengnan Commune to inspect the work found that the house of Huang Wangsheng, a "Five Guarantees" household in the Xiayangwan Production Team, had a thick layer of snow on it, so they immediately helped him clear the snow from the roof with the commune members.
    Zhang Tao, Secretary of the Dangtu County Party Committee, first went to the homes of poor and lower-middle peasant commune members in the Tangnan Commune and Dalong Commune to visit them. He found that some commune members' families lacked firewood. He discussed solutions with the commune and brigade cadres while consulting with the poor and lower-middle peasants on how to fundamentally increase the source of firewood. In the evening, he also worked with the production team cadres and commune members to repair some leaky cattle sheds. At the same time, he asked the county party committee office to notify all localities to do a good job in protecting the cattle from the cold.
    More than two hundred county, district, and commune cadres in Xuancheng County went to the countryside in the snow to visit the masses and ask about their well-being. Li Meiying, Secretary of the Zhugiao Commune Party Committee, at the Zhuqiao Production Team of Zhoucun Brigade, found that the family of a commune member with weak labor was living in relative difficulty, and the head of the household was currently ill at home. Li Meiying immediately discussed with the team cadres to help solve the problem. Li Youan, Secretary of the Shuangqiao Commune Party Committee, braved the wind and snow all day on the 11th to visit seven or eight production teams, inspected the production and living conditions of the masses, and also inspected the cattle sheds one by one.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 18th) Recently, a spring snow fell in the rural areas south of the Yangtze River. Several thousand cadres in Kunshan County, taking Jiao Yulu as an example, braved the wind and snow to visit the thatched cottages of poor and lower-middle peasants and the fishing boats on the large rivers and small streams, asking about their well-being.
    On February 11th, many of the cadres stationed in the Bacheng Commune, like Jiao Yulu, braved the cold wind and heavy snow to go to the brigade and production teams to inspect work. Some went into the cattle sheds to check the cold protection of the cattle, some checked the storage of green duckweed (green fertilizer crops), and some ran to the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants to find out if they had any difficulties in their lives. Li Yijun, the cadre in charge of the station, came to the Yangmu Brigade during the snowfall, arranged post-snow production with the brigade cadres, and immediately went to the production teams to inspect production. Zhou Fengqi, a cadre stationed in the village, braved the snow and ran more than twenty miles to see four cattle sheds. He saw that one cattle shed had no door and many wind leaks, and immediately worked with the commune members to make a door and block the wind holes. He also went to visit old poor peasant commune member Yuan Zhongbiao and hardship household Zhai Jinlong. On the way back and forth, his clothes were soaked with snow water.
    Xu Jinlong, a cadre of the Bacheng Commune, arrived at the Sixth Production Team of Yongfeng Brigade and saw that the two thatched cottages of poor peasant commune member Xue Shoufu were covered with a thick layer of snow, which was in danger of collapsing. He immediately went up to the roof with production team leader Lu Xiaodi to sweep away the snow and prop up the house with bamboo. Xue Shoufu said with emotion: "The cadres are more considerate than we are ourselves."
    The cadres working in the Chengnan Commune, when it snowed, remembered Jiao Yulu's words: "When the snow seals the door, we cannot sit in the office and warm ourselves by the fire, we should go to the masses." Everyone immediately went to visit the fishermen's boats in the snow. Yin Chenzhi, a sixty-five-year-old fisherman, said with tears in his eyes: "In the old society, I held my child and braved the wind and snow to beg for food; today, with such heavy snow, you still come to my boat to care for us so much. We must thank Chairman Mao for this!"

    芜湖专区、昆山县干部以实际行动学习焦裕禄
    顶风踏雪探望群众问寒问暖
    昆山县六十五岁老渔民殷臣之含着眼泪说：“在旧社会，我抱着孩子冒着风雪去讨饭；今天下这么大的雪，你们还来到我船上，这样关心我们，这要感谢毛主席！”
    据新华社合肥十八日电 最近，安徽省沿江的芜湖专区下了一场大雪。学习了焦裕禄同志光辉事迹的许多干部，包括许多县委书记、县长，都象焦裕禄同志那样，顶风踏雪，到生产队去，和群众一道研究生产，关心群众生活。中共郎溪县委书记庞锡田在雪后一方面让办公室干部打电话通知各公社，注意安排生产。一方面带领一批干部到生产队和水利工地去了解群众的生产和生活情况，还带领干部到正在施工的水库溢洪道上去扫雪，并且组织民工修好了十二条运土道路，为雪后早开工创造条件。这个县前往城南公社李家村大队检查工作的干部，发现下杨湾生产队五保户黄旺生家房子积雪较厚，就马上和社员一道，帮助他家扫除了屋上的积雪。
    中共当涂县委书记张涛到了塘南公社和大陇公社首先到一些贫农下中农社员家里去探望。他发现有的社员家里缺柴烧，就一边和社队干部研究解决办法，一边找贫下中农商量如何从根本上增加烧柴来源的问题。晚上，他还和生产队的干部、社员一起，修缮了一些漏风的牛屋。同时要县委办公室通知各地做好耕牛防寒保暖工作。
    宣城县有二百多名县、区、社干部在下雪的时候踏雪下乡，到群众中间去问寒问暖。朱桥公社党委书记李梅英在周村大队朱桥生产队，发现一个劳力弱的社员家里生活比较困难，眼下户主生病在家。李梅英马上就同队干部研究，帮助解决。双桥公社党委书记李有安，十一日一整天，顶风踏雪跑了七八个生产队，检查群众生产、生活情况，还逐个地检查了牛屋。
    据新华社南京十八日电最近江南农村下了一场春雪，昆山县有好几千名干部以焦裕禄为榜样，冒风雪到贫下中农的茅屋里和大河小浜的渔船上，看望群众，问寒问暖。
    在巴城公社蹲点的干部，二月十一日那天，有许多人象焦裕禄那样，顶着寒风大雪，到大队和生产队去检查工作。有的走进牛棚，检查耕牛防寒保暖情况，有的检查绿萍（绿肥作物）保管情况，有的跑到贫农下中农家里去了解他们生活上有无难处。蹲点的负责干部李一钧在下雪时来到杨木大队，和大队干部布置了雪后生产，并立即到各生产队去检查生产。蹲点干部周凤其冒雪跑到二十多里以外的地方去看了四个牛棚。他看到一个牛棚没有门，漏风洞很多，当即和社员们一道弄了一扇门，堵塞了风洞。他还到老贫农社员袁仲标和困难户翟金龙的家里去探望，往返途中，全身的衣服都被雪水浸湿了。
    巴城公社干部徐金龙到了永丰大队第六生产队，看到贫农社员薛寿福的两间茅草屋上雪压得厚厚的，有倒坍的危险。他马上和生产队长陆小弟上屋扫掉积雪，并用毛竹把房子撑好。薛寿福感动地说：“干部想的比我们自己还周到。”
    在城南公社蹲点工作的干部，下雪时想起焦裕禄说的话：“在大雪封门的时候，我们不能坐在办公室里烤火，应该到群众中去。”大家马上就分头冒雪到渔民船上去访问。六十五岁的渔民殷臣之含着眼泪说：“在旧社会，我抱着孩子冒着风雪去讨饭；今天下这么大的雪，你们还来到我船上，这样关心我们，这要感谢毛主席！”
