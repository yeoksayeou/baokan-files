    "The Song of Ouyang Hai" is an inspiring and excellent novel. It can give people strength and encourage them to move forward.

    Recently, I had some problems with my thinking. I envied factories and mines and wasn't very content with rural work. I applied to join the army twice but was not approved, so my mood was a bit low, and I didn't feel like working. After reading "The Song of Ouyang Hai," it sounded an alarm for me, set up a model, and gave me a strong shock. Ouyang Hai always picked up the heaviest burdens at any time and any place, vying to do the most difficult tasks and facing the toughest challenges. Wherever it was most arduous, there he was; wherever it was most difficult, there he was. He strived to be ahead of others in work, never cared about personal enjoyment, and was willing to sacrifice his life to rescue the people's lives and property. For the people, for the revolution, he risked everything. I thought, Ouyang Hai is a youth of the Mao Zedong era, and I am also a youth of the Mao Zedong era; Ouyang Hai is the son of a poor peasant, and I am also the son of a poor peasant, so why can he make such great contributions, while I am doing nothing, only thinking about my own petty affairs? Comparing the two, I feel infinitely ashamed. Thinking of this, I deeply regret that everything I thought before was wrong, which not only affected the Party's work but also hindered my own progress. "The Song of Ouyang Hai" gave me a profound education and pointed out the direction for my future progress. From now on, I must take Ouyang Hai as an example, learn his noble qualities of always working for the revolution and doing everything for the people, listen to the Party, listen to Chairman Mao, settle down in agricultural production, do rural work earnestly and practically, and contribute my own strength to building a new socialist countryside.

    鼓起革命干劲，建设新农村
    欧阳葵
    《欧阳海之歌》是部激动人心的好小说。它能给人增加力量，鼓舞人们前进。
    前一晌，我的思想有点毛病。羡慕工厂矿山，不太安心农村工作。两次参军没批准，情绪有些低沉，工作也没劲干了。读了《欧阳海之歌》，给我敲起了警钟，树立了样板，受到了强烈的震动。欧阳海随时随地拣重担子挑，抢难的做，找硬的上。那里最艰苦，那里就有他；那里最困难，那里就有他。工作他争在别人前头，享受他毫不计较，为了抢救人民的生命财产，牺牲生命也在所不惜。为了人民，为了革命，他把一切都豁出去了。我想，欧阳海是毛泽东时代的青年，我也是毛泽东时代的青年；欧阳海是贫农的儿子，我也是贫农的儿子，为什么他能作出这样大的贡献，我却无所作为，老想着个人鼻子底下的小事呢？两相对照，感到无限惭愧。想到这里，我非常后悔，以前想的全错了，既影响了党的工作，也阻碍了自己的进步。《欧阳海之歌》对我进行了一次深刻的教育，为我指出了前进的方向。今后，我一定要以欧阳海为榜样，学习他处处为革命，事事为人民的高贵品质，听党的话，听毛主席的话，安心农业生产，踏踏实实地搞好农村工作，为建设社会主义新农村贡献自己的力量。
