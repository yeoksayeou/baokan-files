    Workshop blackboard bulletin,
    Really well done!
    Before work, after work,
    Everyone loves to take a look.
    Here rings our oath,
    Here rings the bugle call of the charge;
    Chairman Mao's quotations shine with golden light,
    A round red sun shines in the workshop.
    Workshop blackboard bulletin,
    Really well done!
    “Innovation enthusiasts” come here to learn,
    “Clever girls” come here to offer treasures,
    A great lad conquered a key problem yesterday,
    And gets on the front page of the blackboard bulletin today.
    Compare, learn, catch up, help, and surpass,
    The blackboard bulletin sparks a high tide!
    Workshop blackboard bulletin,
    Really well done!
    The bulletin board connects to Asia, Africa, and Latin America,
    The whole world looks this way—
    Vietnamese brothers beat the flying thieves,
    Equatorial war drums beat loudly,
    The anti-imperialist storm sweeps the globe,
    Revolutionary flames soar to the sky!
    Workshop blackboard bulletin,
    Really well done!
    Here is like a gas station,
    Take a look, and we feel a surge of strength all over!

毛主席  Mao Zhuxi
