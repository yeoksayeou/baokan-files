    As soon as it's their day off, comrades Zeng Taiming, the assistant driller, and He Fuquan, the driver, are kept busy because they both have excellent shoemaking skills, and comrades are happy to bring their worn-out shoes for them to mend. There's quite a story behind Little Zeng and Little He's shoemaking!
    One day in early summer, He Fuquan was picking up rags in the trash pit to mend his clothes when he saw several pairs of leather shoes with holes in the soles. He picked them up and saw that the uppers were all in good condition, just the soles were worn through. He thought: If I could find a way to put new soles on these, wouldn't they be as good as new shoes? He picked them up and brought them back. When his day off came, he asked at the shoe repair shop and, good heavens, the price to repair one pair of shoes was 2.5 yuan, so two pairs would cost five yuan. He Fuquan carried the shoes back to the dormitory, thinking all the way: If I could make a shoe last myself and buy some nails, I could nail the shoes myself and save a lot of money! He told Little Zeng his idea. Little Zeng agreed wholeheartedly. The next day, one went to pick up old shoes and scraps of leather, and the other asked the maintenance station for a shoe last to be made by the blacksmith. The blacksmiths were very supportive and made them a new shoe last. That day, Little He also picked up a lot of old shoe scraps and also asked someone to buy a large package of nails for nailing shoes. On another Sunday, they used their time off to repair the broken shoes they had collected and put these shoes in the team as public shoes. From then on, Little Zeng and Little He became famous for repairing shoes, and on their days off they automatically became volunteer cobblers. Also, since then, we no longer go to the street to repair shoes, and some comrades have also learned to repair shoes.

    义务补鞋匠
    副司钻　程洪福
    一到休息天，可忙坏了司钻曾太明和司机贺福全二位同志，因为他俩有一手补鞋的好手艺，同志们都愿意把破了的鞋拿来叫他们补。提起小曾和小贺补鞋，还有一段故事呢！
    夏初的一天，贺福全到垃圾坑里拣破布补衣服，看到那儿丢了好几双穿通了底的皮鞋。他拣起来一看，帮都好好的，就是通了底。他心想：要能设法把这些底配上，不是能当新鞋穿吗？他把它们拣了回来。到了休息天，他到修鞋铺一问，好家伙，一双鞋补价是二元五，两双就得五元。贺福全提着几双鞋子回到宿舍，一路上心里捉摸着：我要是能自己做一个鞋拐，再去买些钉子，自己来钉鞋，不就可节省很多钱吗？他把想法告诉了小曾。小曾很赞同。第二天，一个去拣破鞋烂皮，一个到保养站要求锻工给打个鞋拐。锻工们很支持他们，给他们打了个新鞋拐。这天，小贺也拣回来很多旧鞋烂皮，还托人买来了一大包钉鞋用的钉子。又一个星期日，他俩就利用休息时间修补好了拣来的破鞋，并把这几双鞋放在班里作公鞋。打那以后，小曾和小贺补鞋就出了名，一到休息天，他们就自动成了义务补鞋匠。也是打那以后，我们就不再上街补鞋了，而且有些同志也学会了补鞋。
