    According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 1st: How to better prevent silicosis from harming mine workers? Chinese scientific and technical workers have explored a relatively complete set of technical experiences. The National Academic Conference on Ventilation and Dust Prevention in Metal Mines, recently held in Wuhan, centrally exchanged experiences in this area. These technical experiences have basically been integrated into a complete system and have been promoted and applied in many metal mines.
    Silica dust is a type of dust containing free silicon dioxide that is produced by mine excavators when drilling, blasting rocks, and loading, unloading, and transporting ore. It is very harmful to the health of mine workers and affects the smooth progress of production.
    In order to better integrate silicosis prevention research with practice, in recent years, scientific and technical personnel engaged in metal mine ventilation and dust prevention have gone to the mines and worked alongside the miners to conduct various research activities, thus achieving many research results suitable for China's mining conditions.
    In the study of mine ventilation systems, scientific and technical personnel have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, broken away from the original foreign frameworks, and creatively researched and successfully developed zonal independent ventilation systems, checkerboard-style and staggered up-and-down ventilation networks suitable for China's complex and changeable mine geological characteristics. These ventilation methods have the advantages of reasonable layout and good ventilation and dust removal effects, and the required equipment is relatively economical and simple, which is very popular among mine workers.
    In the metal mining production process, dust is generated in workplaces such as raises, ore passes, and electric scraper roadways, where labor intensity is high and ventilation is poor. Ventilation and dust removal in these areas has long been a difficult problem in mine ventilation at home and abroad. In recent years, scientific and technical personnel have carried out technological innovations together with enterprise employees, and have researched and developed many effective measures combining indigenous and foreign methods, so that these "difficult problems" have been solved.
    Scientific and technical personnel in various regions have also achieved many results in the automation and mechanization of ventilation and dust prevention equipment and tools. The successfully researched items include electric clock type, mercury or bimetallic sheet contact type local fan automation devices, foldable and electromagnetic automatic air doors, shielding, foot-operated and electric automatic water curtains, and various types of wet and dry dust-collecting rock drills.
    Significant results have also been achieved in the study and adoption of new technologies. The filter membrane dust measurement technology, which has only been developed in foreign countries in recent years, has been widely used in China; newer instruments such as photoelectric dust measurement and electrostatic dust measurement have also been successively tested industrially recently. In addition, the research on new technologies such as electrical dust removal has also achieved many results.
    More than 120 representatives from 22 provinces and cities attended the meeting. Among them were workers, experts, professors, and scientific and technical workers. They unanimously stated that they would continue to take Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, let politics command professional work, push China's metal mine ventilation and dust prevention work to a higher level, and make new contributions to completely conquering silicosis hazards.

    我国金属矿山通风防尘工作获重要成果
    科学技术工作者决心为彻底战胜矽尘危害作出新贡献
    据新华社武汉一日电　如何更好地防止矽尘对矿山工人的危害？我国科学技术工作者已探索出了一套比较完整的技术经验。最近在武汉举行的全国金属矿山通风防尘学术会议，集中交流了这方面的经验。这些技术经验已经基本上配套成龙，并且在许多金属矿山推广运用。
    矽尘是矿山采掘工人在开凿、爆破岩石和装卸、运输矿石时产生的一种含有游离二氧化矽的粉尘。它对矿山工人的身体健康危害很大，影响生产的顺利进行。
    为了使防止矽尘的研究工作更好地结合实际，近几年来，从事金属矿山通风防尘的科学技术人员纷纷下楼出院，深入矿山跟班劳动，同矿山职工一起进行各项研究活动，从而取得了许多适合我国矿山条件的研究成果。
    在矿井通风系统的研究中，科学技术人员发扬自力更生的革命精神，打破原有的洋框框，根据我国矿山矿床地质复杂多变等具体特点，创造性地研究成功了适合我国矿井条件的分区独立的通风系统、棋盘式和上下行间隔式通风网路。这些通风方法，既具有布局合理、通风除尘效果好的优点，所需要的设备也比较经济简便，深受矿山职工的欢迎。
    在金属矿山生产过程中，天井、溜井、电耙巷道等作业地点产生的粉尘多、劳动强度大、通风不良。这些地区的通风除尘，一直是国内外矿井通风中长期没有得到很好解决的老大难问题。最近几年，科学技术人员同企业职工一道开展技术革新，研究出了不少土洋结合的有效措施，使这些“老大难”问题得到了解决。
    各地科学技术人员在通风防尘设备和工具自动化、机械化研究方面，也取得了许多成果。已经研究成功的，有电钟式、水银或双金属片接点式等局扇自动化装置，折叠式、电磁式自动风门，遮挡式、脚踏式和电动式的自动水幕，以及各种类型的湿式和干式捕尘凿岩机等。
    在研究采用新技术方面也取得了显著成果。近几年来在国外才发展起来的滤膜测尘技术，在我国已经普遍应用；比这更新的光电测尘和静电测尘等仪器，最近也相继进行了工业性试验。此外，电气除尘等新技术的研究也取得了不少成果。
    有二十二个省市的一百二十多名代表出席了这次会议。他们当中有工人、专家、教授和科学技术工作者。他们一致表示，要继续以毛泽东思想为指针，以政治统帅业务，把我国金属矿山通风防尘工作推向更高水平，为彻底战胜矽尘危害作出新的贡献。
