　　Advance Bravely Knowing the Difficulties
　　A person in the revolutionary torrent is like a boat sailing against the current; if you don't advance, you retreat. I am determined that if I am not as good as Jiao Yulu in the first half of my life, I must catch up in the second half.
　　Comrade Jiao Yulu's fighting life deeply educated me, gave me courage, and strengthened my confidence and determination to change the backward face of Su County.
　　Comrade Jiao Yulu led the 360,000 people of Lankao to overcome the three scourges of waterlogging, wind and sand, and saline-alkali land, and quickly changed the disaster-stricken appearance. Although Su County is an old disaster area, its natural conditions are better than Lankao's, but its production appearance has not changed as quickly as Lankao's. The main responsibility lies with myself. Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, I am too far behind! Comrade Jiao Yulu faced the "three scourges" without hesitation, advancing in the face of difficulties. But what about me? Instead of advancing in the face of difficulties and daring to take on heavy burdens like Jiao Yulu, I wanted to choose light burdens. I have been in Huaibei for more than ten years, but my thinking has not really taken root. In the face of natural disasters, I lacked strong fighting spirit and accomplished nothing. Sometimes I even thought that the work tasks in Su County were heavy, and it was prone to disasters, so it would be better to work in Jiangnan or Huainan, wanting to transfer away from Su County and escape the difficulties. Therefore, although I have been in Su County for more than ten years, my understanding of Su County is not as much as Jiao Yulu's understanding of Lankao in one year.
　　I repeatedly compared, thought over and over, and found that the difference lay in not studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as flexibly as Jiao Yulu did, especially in not using Mao Zedong Thought to transform my subjective world. In the past, although I also studied Chairman Mao's works, I mostly used them to educate others, and relaxed my self-transformation. I thought that I had been making revolution for half my life, and in the past I followed the Party, and I would continue to follow the Party in the future, and there would be no problems. But that is not how things developed. Now I realize clearly that a person in the revolutionary torrent is like a boat sailing against the current; if you don't advance, you retreat. After learning from Jiao Yulu, I am determined that if I am not as good as Jiao Yulu in the first half of my life, I must catch up in the second half. I cannot rely on my "seniority" and live off my "old capital." I must strictly demand myself with high standards. I must study and apply Chairman Mao's works flexibly, and use the standpoints, viewpoints, and methods of Mao Zedong Thought to transform both the subjective world and the objective world.
　　Currently, the problem before me is that the face of Su County has not changed much. I am determined to work with the people of Su County, with a tenacious will, daring to despise difficulties, and being good at overcoming difficulties. In the struggle against natural disasters, I will take Jiao Yulu as an example and be determined to change the face of Su County.
　　Tang Haiping, Deputy Secretary of the Su County Party Committee, Anhui Province

　　知难勇进
    一个人在革命的洪流中，也如逆水行舟，不进则退。我下定决心，前半辈子不如焦裕禄，后半辈子一定要赶上
    焦裕禄同志战斗的一生，深深地教育了我，给了我勇气，增强了我对改变宿县落后面貌的信心和决心。
    焦裕禄同志领导着兰考三十六万人民，战胜内涝、风沙、盐碱三害，迅速改变了多灾的面貌。宿县虽然是个老灾区，但自然条件比兰考好，生产面貌不如兰考改变得快。主要的责任在自己。我跟焦裕禄同志相比，差得太多太远啦！焦裕禄同志面对着“三害”，毫不犹疑，迎着困难前进。而我呢？不是象焦裕禄那样知难而进，勇于挑重担子，而是想挑轻担子。我来淮北十几年，思想上却没真正扎下根，在自然灾害面前，缺乏顽强的斗志，无所作为。有时还认为宿县工作任务重，好闹灾荒，不如在江南、淮南工作，想调离宿县，逃避困难。因此，虽然身在宿县十几年，但对宿县的情况还不如焦裕禄一年对兰考了解的多。
    我反复对照，左思右想，千差万差，都差在没有象焦裕禄那样活学活用毛主席著作，特别是没有把毛泽东思想用来改造自己的主观世界。过去虽然也学习了毛主席的著作，多是用于教育别人，放松了自我改造。认为自己已革了半辈子命，过去是跟着党走，今后还是会跟着党走下去的，不会有什么问题。事情的发展并不是这样。现在我才清醒地认识到，一个人在革命的洪流中，也如逆水行舟，不进则退。学习焦裕禄以后，我下定决心：前半辈子不如焦裕禄，后半辈子一定要赶上，不能依“老”卖“老”，靠“老本”吃饭，要以高标准严格要求自己。要活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想的立场、观点、方法，来改造主观世界和客观世界。
    当前，摆在我面前的问题是宿县的面貌还没有很大改变，我决心同宿县人民一道，以顽强的意志，敢于藐视困难，善于战胜困难，在同自然灾害作斗争中，以焦裕禄为榜样，立志改变宿县面貌。
    安徽宿县县委副书记　唐海萍
