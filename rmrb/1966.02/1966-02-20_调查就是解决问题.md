    "Investigate first, then decide." The Neixiang County Party Committee, with this practical action, is learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong, and has reasonably resolved the construction plan for the head of the Xingfu Canal. They have done very well.
    The first manifestation of Comrade Jiao Yulu's strong Party spirit is the close connection between theory and practice. Following Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching that "no investigation, no right to speak," he conducted a serious and thorough investigation and study of the overall situation in Lankao County. Based on the actual situation, he formulated a plan to overcome the "three harms." When fierce disputes arose in the construction of the head of the Xingfu Canal, the Neixiang County Party Committee used Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror to examine their own leadership style and working methods, and found a way to solve the problem.
    Comrade Mao Zedong told us that many people engaged in leadership work, when encountering difficult problems that cannot be solved, what should they do? It is to "stretch your legs and walk around in various parts and places within your work area, learn from Confucius' 'ask about everything,' no matter how small your talent, you can solve the problem, because your brain was empty when you left the door, and when you return, your brain is no longer empty, it has already carried various necessary materials to solve the problem, and the problem is solved in this way." The Neixiang County Party Committee acted in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, and the plan for the construction of the head of the Xingfu Canal was smoothly produced. From here, their understanding of Comrade Jiao Yulu's famous saying "eating steamed buns that others have chewed is tasteless" became even deeper.
    In the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experimentation, we are faced with great, arduous, and complex tasks. Many things are unfamiliar to us; some things that were familiar in the past, such as class struggle, can no longer be simply handled according to old experiences due to the development of the situation. Before us, there are countless realms of necessity that have not been recognized. If we do not treat this realm of necessity seriously, as Comrade Jiao Yulu did, in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, then in different aspects of our work, there will be varying degrees of blindness, and there will be no freedom. We must strive to free ourselves from this blindness in different aspects and to varying degrees. Conduct systematic and thorough investigations and studies of the areas in which we work, and grasp first-hand information. This is the only way from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom.
    To conduct investigation and research, grasp first-hand information, and then solve problems, requires arduous labor. In order to weigh the weight of the "three harms" in Lankao County, Comrade Jiao Yulu took the lead in walking through most of the villages in the county, braving the wind and sand, enduring the severe cold, wading through floods, regardless of day and night, fatigue, or danger, inspecting wind gaps, exploring quicksand, and measuring water conditions. His revolutionary spirit, his scientific attitude, and his mass line working methods enabled him to finally understand the laws of the "three harms" in Lankao County and move from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom.
    Investigation and research is a matter for the entire Party, and first and foremost, it is a matter for leading cadres at all levels. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong, the vast number of cadres in our Party have attached importance to investigation and research for many years. However, not all comrades have fully understood the paramount importance of investigation and research in any situation and in any work. Therefore, among many of our comrades, the rough and careless, cartoon-like, and lack of systematic and thorough understanding, the self-righteous subjectivist style, and the empty and superficial formalist style have not been completely eliminated. The Party Central Committee's decision on investigation and research long ago pointed out: "The rough and careless, self-righteous subjectivist style is the first manifestation of impure Party spirit; while seeking truth from facts and closely linking theory with practice is the minimum attitude of a Party member with a strong Party spirit."
    Every Party member, cadre, and especially leading comrades, must resolutely strengthen our Party spirit training in accordance with the Party Central Committee's decisions and Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings. We must adopt an attitude of being highly responsible to the Party and the people in any work and any problem, conduct investigation and research conscientiously, and solve problems in a realistic manner.

### 调查就是解决问题

    调查就是解决问题
    “先调查，后决定”，内乡县委这样用实际行动向毛泽东同志的好学生——焦裕禄同志学习，合理地解决了兴建幸福渠渠首的施工方案。他们作的很对。
    焦裕禄同志党性坚强的第一个表现，就是理论与实际的密切联系，他遵照毛泽东同志“没有调查就没有发言权”的教导，认真地、周密地对兰考县的全面情况进行调查研究，根据实际情况，制定了战胜“三害”的方案。内乡县委在兴建幸福渠渠首工程发生激烈争论的时候，就用焦裕禄同志作镜子，对照检查自己的领导作风和工作方法，找到了解决问题的途径。
    毛泽东同志告诉过我们，许多作领导工作的人，遇到困难问题不能解决，该怎么办呢？就是“迈开你的两脚，到你的工作范围的各部分各地方去走走，学个孔夫子的‘每事问’，任凭什么才力小也能解决问题，因为你未出门时脑子是空的，归来时脑子已经不是空的了，已经载来了解决问题的各种必要材料，问题就是这样子解决了。”内乡县委按照毛泽东同志的教导作了，兴建幸福渠渠首工程的方案也就顺利产生了。从这里，他们对于焦裕禄同志说的“吃别人嚼过的馍没味道”这句名言，体会得也更深刻了。
    在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中，我们面临着伟大、艰巨、复杂的任务。许多事情是我们所不熟悉的；有些过去熟悉的事情，比如阶级斗争，又由于形势的发展，也不能简单地照老经验办事了。在我们面前，有着许许多多未被认识的必然王国。如果我们不是按照毛泽东同志的教导，象焦裕禄同志那样，去认真地对待这个必然王国，那么，在我们工作的不同方面，就会有不同程度的盲目性，就不会有自由。我们必须努力从这种不同方面、不同程度的盲目性中解放出来。系统地、周密地对我们从事工作的领域进行调查研究，掌握第一手资料。这就是从必然王国到自由王国的必经之路。
    进行调查研究，掌握第一手资料，进而解决问题，需要付出艰巨的劳动。焦裕禄同志为了掂一掂兰考县“三害”的分量，带头走遍全县大部分村庄，顶风沙，冒严寒，涉洪水，不分日夜，不顾疲劳，不怕危险，查风口，探流沙，测水情。他的这种革命精神，这种科学态度，这种群众路线的工作方法，使他终于能够认识兰考县“三害”的规律，从必然王国走向自由王国。
    调查研究是我们全党的事情，首先是各级领导干部的事情。我们党的广大干部，在毛泽东同志教导下，多年来是重视调查研究的。但是，对于调查研究在任何情况下、任何工作中的头等重要性，并不是所有同志都已经完全懂得了的。因此，在我们许多同志中，粗枝大叶的、漫画式的、缺乏系统的周密的了解，自以为是的主观主义作风，空疏肤浅的形式主义作风，并没有彻底消灭。我们党中央关于调查研究的决定早就指出：“粗枝大叶、自以为是的主观主义作风，就是党性不纯的第一个表现；而实事求是，理论与实际密切联系，则是一个党性坚强的党员的起码态度。”
    我们每一个党员、干部，特别是领导同志，必须坚决按照党中央的决定和毛泽东同志的教导，加强我们的党性锻炼。我们要在任何工作、任何问题上，都采取对党、对人民高度负责的态度，认真进行调查研究，实事求是地解决问题。
