    American *Newsweek* calls Washington today "the gray capital," writing: "In the memory of almost any Washingtonian, the mood of the nation's capital has never been so bleak or gloomy. It is filled with an atmosphere of anxiety and doubt. The entire Washington conversation about this Asian war is also low, almost a helpless sob." ... These few strokes vividly depict the current predicament of the American ruling group.
    The Johnson administration's policy of aggression in Vietnam has suffered serious setbacks, yet it attempts to seek a way out by expanding the war. This approach cannot but arouse increasingly strong opposition and unease among broad strata of the American people. The wave of the American people's opposition to the war of aggression against Vietnam continues to rise, and the Johnson administration is already in a position of being condemned by thousands at home. At the same time, due to the dead end and bleak prospects in the war of aggression against Vietnam, unprecedented contradictions and disputes have also broken out within the American ruling group over the question of how to continue the aggressive policy in Vietnam. This out-of-the-ordinary phenomenon reflects the current predicament of American imperialism. Precisely because the American ruling group refuses to change its basic policy of aggression against Vietnam, and yet it is impossible to find a way to save America from complete failure, it cannot but fall into great distress, blaming and accusing each other, which naturally becomes unavoidable. How can Washington not be shrouded in an atmosphere of bleakness and gloom, anxiety and doubt?
    Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out that reactionaries will never admit their defeat. This is because they not only need to deceive others, but also need to deceive themselves, otherwise they cannot live. It is entirely predictable that no matter how fierce the current infighting within the American ruling group may be, American imperialism will not deviate from the logic of making trouble, failing, making trouble again, failing again, until its demise. Therefore, even bleaker and gloomier days are still ahead for Washington.

### 为何凄凉和阴郁

    为何凄凉和阴郁
    美国《新闻周刊》把今天的华盛顿称为“灰色的首都”，它写道：在几乎任何一个华盛顿人的记忆里，这个国家首都的心情从来不曾这样凄凉或者阴郁。它充满着焦虑和疑惑的气氛。整个华盛顿关于这场亚洲战争的谈论也低沉得近乎一种毫无办法的啜泣。……这寥寥几笔，活活地画出了美国统治集团当前的窘态。
    约翰逊政府的侵越战争政策遭到了严重挫败，却企图从扩大战争中寻求出路，这种做法当然不能不引起美国广泛阶层越来越强烈的反对和不安。美国人民反对侵越战争的浪潮继续高涨，约翰逊政府在国内已处于千夫所指的地位。同时，由于在侵越战争中走投无路，前途渺茫，美国统治集团内部围绕着在越南的侵略政策究竟要怎样干下去这样一个问题，也爆发了空前未有的矛盾和争吵。这种脱出常轨的现象，反映了美帝国主义目前焦头烂额的困境。正是因为美国统治集团不肯改变它侵略越南的基本政策，而又不可能找到挽救美国彻底失败的办法，它就不能不陷于极大的苦闷之中，互相埋怨，互相责难，自然成为不可避免。华盛顿又怎能不笼罩着一片凄凉和阴郁、焦虑和疑惑的气氛呢？
    毛泽东同志曾经指出，反动派是永远不会承认他们的失败的。这是因为他们不但需要欺骗别人，也需要欺骗他们自己，不然他们就不能过日子。完全可以预料得到，不管美国统治集团内部目前争吵得怎样激烈，美帝国主义是不会背离捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡这个逻辑的。因此，华盛顿更凄凉和阴郁的日子还在后头哩。
