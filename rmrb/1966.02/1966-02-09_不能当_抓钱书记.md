    In 1963, I was transferred to the Chunxi Road Department Store to serve as the Party Branch Secretary. At the time, because it was the first time I had led a relatively large store, I was unsure where to start. Some leading comrades in the store told me: "The work of基层商店 grassroots stores is both specific and complex, but you only need to focus on three things. First, focus on cleanliness and display; second, focus on service attitude; third, focus on completing tasks." He also said, "The first two tasks are ‘盖面菜 showy things,’ the last task is the most practical. Completing the task gives you a strong backbone, and you can speak with confidence." At the time, I thought it made sense. Although there was ideological struggle in my mind, and I knew that the work of the branch secretary was to grasp politics, because I did not highlight politics in my thinking, I lacked resistance to the habit of "emphasizing business and neglecting politics" that originally existed in the store. I felt that political work was relatively empty, difficult to do, and did not easily show results, so it was better to focus on specific business matters, which would be effective immediately.

    Which is the primary task?
    Under the guidance of this thought, my work was inverted. I grasped business very specifically, all the way down to the team level and to the arrangement of goods; I grasped politics in a general way, staying at the level of holding meetings, giving reports, and even using administrative orders to solve ideological problems. At that time, some employees said that I was a "抓钱书记 money-grabbing secretary." I was not convinced when I heard this, thinking: No matter how I grasp things, my heart is focused on completing the store's tasks! The task of a retail store, after all, is to sell money, isn't it?

    My single-minded focus on business not only failed to complete the business plan well, but also fostered bourgeois selfish ideas among the employees, as well as the capitalist business ideology and style of only caring about selling more money. For example, some salespersons competed with each other for customers in order to complete their individual money-selling tasks, arguing and becoming un-united; others were full of enthusiasm for big customers when receiving them, but had a cold attitude towards small customers. In a word, I myself and some of the store's employees had lost our way. How dangerous this was!

    Last year, after the spirit of the National Financial and Trade Political Work Conference was conveyed, I reviewed this detour I had taken and had a new understanding of "completing tasks." In the past, I only saw "tasks" as "turnover," and only saw a few figures in my eyes. Now, I realize that the first standard for measuring the completion of tasks is politics. First, we must see how the task was completed? What are the consequences? Was it completed by relying on political work, or by administrative orders or something else? Was the policy implemented, or did it go down a crooked path? Did it enhance socialist revolutionary thought, or did it develop capitalist thought? I further considered: As a branch secretary, a political instructor, how can I be considered to have completed the task assigned by the Party? We must never look at it only from the perspective of economic tasks, let alone measure it by the amount of money sold, but first and foremost, we should look at what kind of thinking the employees we lead have, and whether it meets the requirements of successors to the proletarian revolution. In other words, cultivating a team of employees with high political consciousness is our primary task.

  Grasp learning to grasp the "root"
    How to grasp political work? The National Financial and Trade Political Work Conference proposed: Highlight politics, put politics in command, that is, put Mao Zedong Thought in command; grasping the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works is the central link in grasping ideological and political work well. According to this instruction, our Party Branch started with organizing employees to study Chairman Mao's works to strengthen political work.

    However, what is the purpose of learning? What are the main problems to be solved? At that time, my thinking was not clear enough. Therefore, in learning, there were problems such as discussing things as they are, learning for the sake of learning, and simplification. For example, when the purchase and sales tasks were not completed, we organized everyone to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Everyone learned and discussed, and it also played a certain role in boosting morale and overcoming difficulties to complete the task, but it could not be consolidated. With the help of our superiors, we discovered through summarizing that the position of political work had not been properly placed, and that strengthening political work was only seen as a guarantee for the completion of the current purchase and sales tasks. In this way, we neglected to fundamentally improve the revolutionary consciousness of the employees, and when organizing the study of Chairman Mao's works, we only grasped the symptoms and did not grasp the root.

      What is the "root"? It is worldview. Specifically for store employees, the first thing to solve is the problem of "for whom to stand at the counter" and "for whom to do business." We then organized all the employees in the store to seriously and repeatedly study "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and launched a large-scale discussion in connection with their ideological reality. This grasp really got to the key. Many employees consciously used Chairman Mao's thought of serving the people to examine themselves, realizing that doing business should serve proletarian politics, and that salespersons should wholeheartedly serve the people.

    After revolutionary thought was initially established, we seized on the living thoughts in the purchase and sales business and used Mao Zedong Thought to solve them, helping everyone further establish the idea of doing business for the revolution and launching a struggle against purely business viewpoints. We successively seized six or seven things that happened in daily purchase and sales activities, such as "the supply of a batch of wool yarn" and "a deal for rubber heels," and organized employees to discuss them. In the end, they all came down to the starting point of considering the problem, that is, whether everything starts from the interests of the people, or from the interests of individuals or small groups? In this way, the study of Mao Zedong Thought became specific, and many employees began to consciously act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. Employees are more enthusiastic about studying Chairman Mao's works. Service attitudes have improved significantly. Customers constantly write letters of thanks or offer verbal and written praise. From here, I truly felt the power of political work. Political work is by no means dispensable, but a fundamental plan that commands everything.

### 不能当“抓钱书记”

    不能当“抓钱书记”
    一九六三年，我被调到春熙路百货商店担任党支部书记。当时，因为是头一次领导一个比较大型的商店，工作从哪里着手，心里没有谱。店里有的领导同志对我说：“基层商店的工作既具体，又复杂，但是只要抓好三件事就行了。就是要一抓清洁陈设，二抓服务态度，三抓完成任务。”他还说：“前两项工作是‘盖面菜’，后一项工作最实在。完成了任务腰杆硬，说得起话。”当时听了，觉得有道理。虽然思想上也有斗争，知道支部书记的工作就是抓政治，但由于自己思想上没有把政治突出出来，对商店里原来存在的“重业务，轻政治”的习惯势力也就缺乏抵抗力。心里认为，政治工作比较空洞，既不好搞，又不容易看出成绩，不如抓业务具体，一抓就见效。
    哪是首要任务？
    在这种思想指导下，我的工作本末倒置了。抓业务很具体，一直抓到小组，抓到商品陈设；抓政治则一般化，停留在开会，作报告，甚至用行政命令的办法去解决思想认识问题。当时，有职工说我是“抓钱书记”，我听了还不服气，心想：不管怎么抓，我一心想的是为了完成商店的任务呀！零售商店的任务，说来说去不就是卖钱吗？
    我这样单纯抓业务，不但业务计划没有完成好，而且在职工中助长了资产阶级的个人自私观念，助长了只顾多卖钱的资本主义经营思想和经营作风。如有些营业员为了完成个人的卖钱任务，互相争买主，吵闹不团结；有的在接待顾客的时候，对大买主满腔热情，对小买主则态度冷淡。一句话，我自己和商店的一些职工已经迷失方向了。这是多么危险哟！
    去年二月全国财贸政治工作会议的精神传达下来，我回顾了这段走过的弯路，对“完成任务”有了新的认识。过去我把“任务”只看成是“营业额”，眼睛里只看到几个数字。现在，我认识到，衡量完成任务好坏的第一个标准是政治。首先要看任务是怎样完成的？后果如何？是依靠政治工作完成的，还是靠行政命令或别的什么？是执行了政策，还是走了邪门歪道？是增强了社会主义的革命思想，还是发展了资本主义思想？我还进一步考虑到：作为一个支部书记，一个政治指导员，怎样才算完成了党交给的任务呢？绝不能只从经济任务来看，更不能用卖钱额多少来衡量，而首先应该看我们带领的职工具有什么样的思想，是否符合无产阶级革命接班人的要求。换句话说，培养一支具有高度政治觉悟的职工队伍，是我们的首要任务。
  抓学习要抓到“本”
    政治工作怎么抓？全国财贸政治工作会议提出：突出政治，政治挂帅，就是毛泽东思想挂帅；抓活学活用毛主席著作，是抓好思想政治工作的中心环节。根据这一指示，我们党支部就从组织职工学习毛主席著作入手，来加强政治工作。
    但是，学习为了什么？主要解决什么问题？当时，思想上是不够明确的。因此，在学习中出现了就事论事，为学习而学习，简单化等情况。如购销任务完不成的时候，就组织大家学习《愚公移山》。大家学了，讨论了，对鼓起干劲，克服困难完成任务也起了一定的作用，但是不能巩固。我们在上级领导的帮助下，通过总结，发现仍然是政治工作的位置没有摆对，把加强政治工作只看成是为了保证当前购销任务的完成。这样，就忽视了从根本上提高职工的革命觉悟，在组织毛主席著作学习的时候，就只抓了标，没有抓到本。
      “本”是什么？是世界观。具体到商店职工来说，就首先要解决“为谁站柜台”“为谁做生意”的问题。我们便组织全店职工认真地反复地学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》，联系思想实际展开了大讨论。这一抓，硬是抓到了关键。许多职工自觉地以毛主席关于为人民服务的思想对照检查自己，认识到做生意要为无产阶级政治服务，营业员要全心全意地为人民服务。
    革命思想初步树立以后，我们又抓住购销业务中的活思想，用毛泽东思想来加以解决，帮助大家进一步树立为革命做生意的思想，同单纯业务观点展开斗争。我们先后抓住日常购销活动中发生的“一批毛线的供应”、“一笔胶底跟的买卖”等六七件事情，组织职工讨论。最终都归结到考虑问题的出发点上，即一切从人民的利益出发，还是从个人或小集团的利益出发？这样一来，学习毛泽东思想就具体化了，不少职工开始能够自觉地按照毛主席的指示办事了。职工们学习毛主席著作更加积极。服务态度显著改善。顾客不断地写来感谢信，或提出口头和书面表扬。从这里，我真正感到了政治工作的威力。政治工作绝不是可有可无的，而是统帅一切的根本大计。
