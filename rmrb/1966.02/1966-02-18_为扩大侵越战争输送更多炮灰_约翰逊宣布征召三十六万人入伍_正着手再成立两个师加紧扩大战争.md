    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th – U.S. President Johnson announced to Congress on the 14th that the United States will conscript approximately 360,000 troops from July 1st of last year to June 30th of this year. This is almost quadrupled compared to the 125,000 originally planned at the beginning of last year.
    Expanding conscription is one of the measures taken by the Johnson administration in an attempt to salvage its defeat by expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. Johnson admitted when talking about this that the expansion of conscription is "a direct result of our commitment to freedom in Southeast Asia."
    Johnson also requested Congress to increase funding for the Selective Service System for this purpose.
    The day before, U.S. Selective Service Director Hershey said in a television interview that the United States would also conscript 160,000 troops from July 1st of this year to June 30th of next year.
    In order to alleviate the difficulty of depleting manpower and send more cannon fodder to the war of aggression against Vietnam, Hershey advocated conscripting young people with minor criminal records. He said that he has ordered local Selective Service offices to re-examine those young people who have not been conscripted for this reason. He also revealed that the authorities intend to forcibly conscript young people who burn their draft cards. Many young people do this because they oppose the U.S. government's policies of aggression and war.
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington – The Johnson administration is currently preparing to establish two more divisions to meet the needs of expanding the war of aggression.
    According to a report by United Press International, the U.S. Continental Army Command recently announced that the U.S. Army is rebuilding the 9th Infantry Division, bringing the number of U.S. Army divisions to seventeen. The 9th Infantry Division was established in 1918 and was deactivated in 1962.
    The U.S. Department of Defense is also stepping up preparations to establish the 4th Marine Division and has submitted a request to Congress for increased funding for this purpose.
    In addition, according to an Associated Press report, the general manager of McDonnell Aircraft Corporation recently announced that the company will double its monthly production of "Phantom" jet fighters used by the U.S. in the war of aggression against Vietnam. To complete this production task, the company's employment will increase by approximately 5,000 people from the current 37,000. A reconnaissance center of the Tactical Air Command in South Carolina has recently begun experimenting with "rapid and active photographic processing equipment." Once this equipment is successfully tested, it will be used extensively in the U.S. military in Vietnam to strengthen the "reconnaissance" activities of the U.S. Air Force. (Attached picture)

    为扩大侵越战争输送更多炮灰
    约翰逊宣布征召三十六万人入伍
    正着手再成立两个师加紧扩大战争
    新华社十五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊十四日向国会宣布，在从去年七月一日到今年六月三十日为止的一年中，美国将征召大约三十六万人入伍。这比在去年年初预定的人数十二万五千差不多翻了两番。
    扩大征兵是约翰逊政府妄图以扩大侵越战争来挽回败局所采取的措施之一。约翰逊在谈到这一点时承认，扩大征兵额“是我们对东南亚的自由所承担的义务的直接结果”。
    约翰逊还要求国会为此而增加征兵局的经费。
    在这前一天，美国征兵局长赫尔希在电视谈话中说，美国从今年七月一日到明年六月三十日还要征召十六万人入伍。
    为了减轻兵源枯竭的困难而给侵越战争输送更多的炮灰，赫尔希主张把那些有轻度犯罪行为的青年征召入伍。他说，已经下令各地征兵局重新审查那些由于这种原因而没有被征召的青年。他还透露，当局打算把那些烧毁征兵证的青年强行征召入伍。许多青年这样做，是因为他们反对美国政府的侵略和战争政策。
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：约翰逊政府为了扩大侵略战争的需要，最近正在着手再成立两个师。
    据合众国际社报道，美国大陆陆军司令部最近宣布，美国陆军正在重建第九步兵师，从而使美国的陆军师达到十七个。第九步兵师是在一九一八年建立的，这个师曾经在一九六二年撤编。
    美国国防部目前还加紧筹建第四海军陆战队师，并为此向国会提出了增加经费的要求。
    此外，据美联社报道，美国麦克唐奈尔飞机公司总经理最近宣布，这家公司将使美国用于侵越战争的“鬼怪式”喷气战斗机的每月生产量增加一倍。为了完成这项生产任务，这家公司的雇用人员将比目前的三万七千人增加大约五千人。在南卡罗来纳州的一个战术空军司令部侦察中心，最近已经开始试验一种“快速和活动的摄影加工装备”。这种装备一旦试验成功，就将在侵越美军中大量使用，以加强美国空军的“侦察”活动。（附图片）
