    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 18th - Former US "Ambassador" to South Vietnam and current Special Advisor to the US President, Taylor, testified yesterday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the Johnson administration's policy of aggression against Vietnam. He emphasized that the United States needed more troops and more bombing to strengthen the war of aggression against Vietnam, vainly attempting to subdue the Vietnamese people with ever-increasing "relentless pressure."
    Taylor expressed opposition to the proposal by former US Ambassador to France, Gavin, and former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kennan, that the United States pursue a "hold strategy" in South Vietnam. He reiterated his "four-point strategy": namely, increasing the US's ground combat capability; intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam; stabilizing the economic, political, and social system of the South Vietnamese puppet regime; and "seeking a decent negotiated settlement." He boasted that these four points were the "best strategy" for the US at present.
    He emphasized that the current 205,000 US troops in South Vietnam were not enough and needed to be further increased. The US's adoption of "offensive military actions" in the war of aggression against Vietnam, including the bombing of North Vietnam, was essential. He demanded that the "scale of attacks" on targets in North Vietnam be "gradually expanded."
    During his testimony, Taylor was questioned by many senators, and fierce arguments broke out between them.
    Democratic Senator Morse accused the US government of violating the Geneva Accords on Indochina. Taylor accused those who criticized and opposed the US government's policy of aggression against Vietnam of giving the American people "extremely false guidance." Morse retorted, "In my opinion, you and the President have been leading the American people astray." Morse's remarks won applause from the people crowded in the back of the Senate's secret meeting room, so much so that the committee chairman Fulbright had to bang on the table to maintain order.
    Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright pointed out that the US military had replaced the French, who were conducting a colonial war in South Vietnam. He expressed "doubt" as to whether US intervention was wise.
    Another Democratic Senator, Gore, expressed particular unease about the risks involved in the US's "quiet, gradual escalation" in Vietnam.
    Senate Democratic Whip Russell Long and Democratic Senator Stennis, among others, spoke in support of the Johnson administration's policy of expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. Stennis said, "We must be prepared to strike the Viet Cong and North Vietnam fiercely and frequently, and strike wherever it is necessary from a military point of view."
    The Senate Foreign Relations Committee resumed its meeting on the 16th. At the meeting on the 16th, some Democratic senators also argued about how to conduct the war of aggression against Vietnam. Russell Long and others clamored to "carry the war of aggression against Vietnam to the end" and expressed support for the government's bill requesting an additional $12.7 billion for the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    Morse and another Democratic Senator, Gruening, proposed an amendment to the above bill, stipulating that US troops should not be sent to Southeast Asia, and that sending troops required explicit authorization from Congress.
    The February 21st issue of *U.S. News & World Report*, published in advance, carried Taylor's conversation with the editors of this weekly.
    Taylor stated at the beginning of the conversation that the United States had no intention of withdrawing its troops from South Vietnam and clamored that the United States would "carry through to the end" its war of aggression in Vietnam and would never retreat. He then touted the "four-point strategy" of strengthening and expanding the war that the United States was implementing in South Vietnam.
    This defeated general from the Vietnam battlefield had to admit that it was impossible for the United States to defeat the South Vietnamese people's armed forces on the battlefield because "the Viet Cong have always had the great advantage of being able to avoid contact." He said that the United States had "no quick solution" and therefore "must have patience and determination."
    In the conversation, Taylor expressed satisfaction with the Soviet Union's position on the Vietnam issue. Someone asked him: "Do you think the Russians might really want to see peace achieved?" He replied, "Yes, one has that feeling, because the Russians have nothing to gain in that part of the world." He also said, "I think the Vietnam War embarrasses them."

    败将泰勒在参院鼓吹扩大侵越战争
    许多参议员表示不满提出严厉质询
    泰勒赞赏苏联领导希望在越南“实现和平”
    据新华社十八日讯　华盛顿消息：美国前驻南越“大使”、现任美国总统特别顾问泰勒，昨天在参议院外交委员会就约翰逊政府侵越政策作证时，强调美国需要有更多的军队和更多的轰炸来加强侵越战争，妄想以不断增加的“无情的压力”使越南人民屈服。
    泰勒表示反对美国前驻法大使加文和前驻苏大使凯南等人提出的美国在南越执行“固守战略”的主张。他重复他的“四点战略”主张：即提高美国的地面战斗的能力；加强对越南北方的轰炸；稳定南越伪政权的经济、政治和社会制度和“谋求体面的谈判解决”。他吹嘘这四点战略是美国目前“最好的战略”。
    他强调，目前在南越的二十万五千名美军是不够的，需要进一步增加。美国在侵越战争中采取“进攻性的军事行动”，包括轰炸越南北方，是必不可少的。他要求对越南北方的目标“逐渐扩大攻击的规模”。
    泰勒在作证中受到许多参议员的质询，他们之间爆发了激烈的争吵。
    民主党参议员莫尔斯指责美国政府违反了关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议。泰勒指责那些批评和反对美国政府侵越政策的人将使美国人民“受到极其错误的指导”。莫尔斯反击说，“依我看，你和总统一直把美国人民引向错误。”莫尔斯这番话赢得了挤得满满的参议院秘密会议室后面的人们的掌声，以致会议主席富布赖特不得不敲桌子来维持秩序。
    外交委员会主席富布赖特指出，美国军队在南越取代了进行殖民战争的法国人。他对美国的干涉是否明智表示“怀疑”。
    另一个民主党参议员戈尔对美国在越南“悄悄的逐步升级”涉及的风险表示特别不安。
    参议院民主党督导拉塞尔·朗和民主党参议员斯坦尼斯等发言支持约翰逊政府扩大侵越战争的作法。斯坦尼斯说，“我们必须准备激烈地、经常地打击越共和北越，而且是从军事观点上看需要打击那里就打击那里”。
    参议院外交委员会于十六日恢复举行会议。在十六日的会议上，一些民主党参议员之间也就侵越战争怎样干的问题发生了争论。拉塞尔·朗等叫嚷要把侵越战争“干到底”，并且表示支持政府要求追加侵越战争拨款一百二十七亿美元的法案。
    莫尔斯和另一个民主党参议员格里宁对上述法案提出了一个修正案，规定不应当把美国军队派到东南亚去，要派军队需要得到国会的明确授权。
    提前出版的二月二十一日一期《美国新闻与世界报道》上发表了泰勒对这家周刊的编辑人员的谈话。
    泰勒在谈话一开始就表示美国一点也没有从南越撤军的意图，叫嚷美国要把它在越南的侵略战争“贯彻到底”，绝不撤退。他紧接着鼓吹美国正在南越实行的强化和扩大战争的“四点战略”。
    这个越南战场的败将不得不承认，美国要在战场上战胜南越人民武装是不可能的，因为“越共一向有着能够避开接触的巨大有利条件”。他说，美国“没有什么迅速解决办法”，因此，“必须有耐心和决心”。
    泰勒在谈话中对苏联在越南问题上的立场表示满意。有人问他：“你是否认为俄国人可能真的希望看到实现和平？”他回答说，“是的，人们有这样一种感觉，因为俄国人在世界的那部分地区没有什么东西可得”。他还说，“我想，越南战争使他们感到为难”。
