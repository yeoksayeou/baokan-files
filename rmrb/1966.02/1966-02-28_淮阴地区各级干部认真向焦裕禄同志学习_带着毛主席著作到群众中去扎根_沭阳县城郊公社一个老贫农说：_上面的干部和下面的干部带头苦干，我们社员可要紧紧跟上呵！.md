　　Huaian Area Cadres at All Levels Earnestly Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu
　　Taking Chairman Mao's Writings to Take Root Among the Masses
    An Old Poor Peasant from the Suburban Commune of Shuyang County Said: "If the Cadres Above and the Cadres Below Take the Lead in Hard Work, We Commune Members Must Follow Closely!"
    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 27) A large number of leading cadres in Huaian Special District, Jiangsu Province, in the upsurge of studying Chairman Mao's writings, are learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu with practical actions, going deep into the front lines of production, determined to do a good job in investigation and research to find ways to achieve stable and high yields, and work with the masses to completely change the low-yield face of the Huaian area.
    At a political work conference convened by the prefectural party committee not long ago, leading cadres of various counties in Huaian Special District, Jiangsu Province, studied the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu in the spirit of rectification. In the study, many county party committee leading cadres compared themselves with Comrade Jiao Yulu and realized that they were not going deep enough into the masses and into reality; they came from the masses too little and went to the masses too much. Some cadres also had ideas of fearing hardship, fearing difficulty, and fearing going to the countryside. They lacked the determination to go deep into the masses and into reality, so they could not see the strength of the masses and could not establish the lofty ambition to change the world. Advanced experiences among the masses were not seen, established, or promoted, and until now, they have not truly grasped the laws of the "three harms" of drought, flood, and salinity in the Huaian area. Everyone believed that the root cause of this situation was that they had not studied and applied Chairman Mao's writings as effectively as Comrade Jiao Yulu, and there were still many selfish ideas in their minds. Why was Comrade Jiao Yulu's study of Chairman Mao's writings so effective? They believed that the key was that he did not sit in the office and pore over books, but went to the masses, to practice, and to the three major revolutionary movements to learn, and he studied with practical problems in mind, so he could learn deeply, apply flexibly, and solve practical problems.
    As soon as the prefectural party committee's political work conference ended, leading cadres and cadres of directly subordinate organs of various counties rushed to the front lines of production. Zhang Yixiang, Secretary of the Guannan County Party Committee, took the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," a hoe, and a backpack, and went with more than ten cadres from the county party committee to the Wuwei Brigade of the Xin'an Commune, which had relatively serious saline-alkali sandy wasteland, to stay there. They were determined to turn the Wuwei Brigade into a model for transforming saline-alkali sandy land and achieving stable and high yields. Cadres in Shuyang County, based on the characteristics of the county's dense lakes and low-lying terrain, which made it prone to flooding and drought, chose the Yezhuang Brigade of the suburban commune, which had relatively poor conditions, as their base, and were determined to thoroughly understand the laws of low yields and frequent disasters in the lake area. Sun Yunqing, Secretary of the County Party Committee, led eighteen cadres to stay in this brigade. They insisted on working for half a day and laboring for half a day, driving the production brigade and production team cadres to participate in labor. Leading cadres of Huaian County went deep into the Jianhuai Brigade, a high-yield model team in the county, determined to summarize high-yield experiences there, use a point to lead the area, and promote production in the county. Under the leadership of the leading cadres of Lianshui and Huaian counties, cadres of county-level organs have asked to go to the most difficult communes and teams to work. More than 300 people have been approved to go to the countryside, and they have expressed their determination not to give up until the "three harms" of drought, flood, and salinity are eliminated and grain output reaches the targets set in the "National Agricultural Development Program." As of now, a total of more than 1,500 cadres from organs in the twelve counties (cities) of the entire special district have gone to the front lines of production. Based on their requests, the Huaian Prefectural Party Committee decided to let them stay in the brigade for a relatively long period, working hard with the commune members for three to five years. The prefectural party committee required them to turn the brigade where they stayed into a model of highlighting politics and relying on their own efforts to turn the tables, and to train themselves into good cadres who are both red and expert.
    After the leading cadres and cadres of directly subordinate organs of various counties went to the countryside, they generally lived in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants and participated in labor with the masses. Some cadres, as soon as they arrived at the grassroots level, not only studied Chairman Mao's writings themselves, but also organized the masses to study. This promoted the participation of cadres in communes, brigades, and production teams in labor and study, and was warmly praised by the masses. Wang Guangde, an old poor peasant from the suburban commune of Shuyang County, said: "Now that the cadres above and the cadres below are taking the lead in hard work, we commune members must follow closely!"
    After the leading cadres of various county party committees went to the grassroots level, the practice of investigation and research was greatly promoted. In order to obtain first-hand materials, they discussed and studied problems with the masses. Gu Wenyu, a cadre of the Suqian County People's Committee, who was leading water conservancy construction, changed the past shortcomings of relying solely on reports from technicians after studying the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu. He personally led technicians to conduct on-site inspections of construction sites to grasp first-hand materials and timely improved some impractical engineering designs, greatly improving the quality of the project. This year, Shuyang County changed dry land to paddy fields. Originally, some people planned to change 200,000 to 300,000 mu, while others advocated 20,000 to 30,000 mu. Because neither side conducted in-depth investigation and research, the two opinions could not be unified. After the county party committee leading cadres went to the grassroots level this time, they investigated and discussed with the masses, and finally decided on 180,000 mu. The masses were very satisfied with this plan.
    The leading cadres of various counties deeply felt that in order to truly take root among the masses and become confidants of the masses, they must be like Jiao Yulu, sharing weal and woe with the masses, being concerned about what the masses are concerned about, and helping the masses when they need it most. On February 21, a heavy snowfall occurred in northern Jiangsu. Cadres from various counties braved the snow before dawn to go to various communes and teams to check on the lives and production of the masses. Li Daochao, Deputy Secretary of the Huaian County Party Committee, notified each commune by telephone on the night of the snowfall to do a good job in preventing frost damage. He had not slept until midnight, and the next morning, he stepped through the snow to the commune to check on the work. Wang Fengling, Minister of the Organization Department of the Shuyang County Party Committee, braved the wind and snow to visit the masses in Guandun Brigade of Maoyu Commune, the most difficult commune in the county. He found that some poor and lower-middle peasants in this brigade were short of grain and firewood, and immediately went to Pingdun Brigade to discuss with cadres and the masses. The Pingdun Brigade lent grain and firewood and personally delivered them to Guandun Brigade. Cadres from various communes, brigades, production teams, and various industries also took action, going deep among the masses to inquire about their well-being. Some commune members said with emotion: "The current cadres have become confidants of our villagers!"
    The cadres of various counties firmly believe that as long as they take root firmly among the masses like Jiao Yulu, fully rely on the masses, and do not take many years, the low-yield and disaster-prone face of the Huaian area can be changed.

　　淮阴地区各级干部认真向焦裕禄同志学习
　　带着毛主席著作到群众中去扎根
    沭阳县城郊公社一个老贫农说：“上面的干部和下面的干部带头苦干，我们社员可要紧紧跟上呵！”
    据新华社南京二十七日电  江苏省淮阴专区各县大批领导干部，在学习毛主席著作的热潮中，用实际行动向焦裕禄同志学习，纷纷深入生产第一线，立志做好调查研究工作，找出实现稳产高产的途径，跟群众一道，彻底改变淮阴地区的低产面貌。
    江苏省淮阴专区各县领导干部，在不久以前地委召开的政治工作会议上，用整风的精神学习了焦裕禄同志的事迹。在学习中，不少县委领导干部和焦裕禄同志对比，察觉到自己深入群众、深入实际不够；从群众中“来”的少，到群众中“去”的多。部分干部还有怕苦、怕难、怕下乡的思想，没有深入群众、深入实际的决心，因此看不到群众的力量，立不下改天换地的雄心壮志，群众中的先进经验看不见、树不起、推不开，直到现在还没有真正掌握淮阴地区旱、涝、盐碱“三害”的规律。大家认为，造成这种情况的根源，就是由于没有象焦裕禄同志那样活学活用毛主席著作，头脑中还夹着不少私心杂念。焦裕禄同志学习毛主席著作为什么那样卓有成效？他们认为，关键在于他不是坐在办公室里啃书本，而是到群众中、到实践中、到三大革命运动中去学的，带着实际问题去学的，因此他能学得深、用得活，能解决实际问题。
    地委政治工作会议一结束，各县领导干部和县直属机关干部纷纷奔赴生产第一线。灌南县委书记张义祥，带了《毛泽东选集》、一把锄头、一个背包，和县委的十多个干部一道，到了盐碱沙荒较严重的新安公社吴圩大队蹲点，他们决心把吴圩大队办成改造盐碱沙地、实现稳产高产的样板。沭阳县干部根据本县湖荡密布、地势低洼、易涝易旱的特点，选择了条件较差的城郊公社业庄大队作为基地，决心把湖荡地区低产多灾的规律摸透。县委书记孙云青带领十八个干部来到这个大队蹲点，他们坚持半天工作、半天劳动，带动生产大队、生产队干部全部参加了劳动。淮安县领导干部深入全县的高产样板队建淮大队，决心在那里总结高产经验，以点带面，推动全县的生产。涟水、淮安两县在领导干部带动下，县级机关的干部纷纷要求到最困难的社队去工作。目前已被批准下乡的有三百多人，他们表示决心，不除旱、涝、碱“三害”，使粮食产量达到“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标，决不罢休。到目前为止，全专区十二个县（市）共有一千五百多名机关干部到了生产第一线。淮阴地委根据他们的要求，决定让他们比较长期地在大队蹲点，与社员一道苦干三年五载。地委要求他们把蹲点大队办成突出政治、自力更生闹翻身的样板，把自己锻炼成为又红又专的好干部。
    各县领导干部和直属机关干部下乡后，一般都住在贫农下中农家里，跟群众一道参加劳动。有的干部一到基层，不仅自己学习毛主席著作，而且组织群众学习。这样就推动了公社、大队、生产队干部更好地参加劳动和学习，受到群众的热烈赞扬。沭阳县城郊公社的老贫农王广德说：“现在上面的干部和下面的干部都带头苦干，我们社员可要紧紧跟上呵！”
    各县县委领导干部到了基层以后，调查研究的风气大大发扬起来。为了取得第一手材料，他们跟群众一起讨论问题、研究问题。正在领导水利建设的宿迁县人民委员会干部顾文友，学习了焦裕禄同志的事迹后，改变了过去单纯依靠技术员汇报的缺点，亲自带领技术员深入工地实地勘察，掌握第一手材料，及时改进了一些不符合实际的工程设计，使工程质量大大提高。沭阳县今年旱地改水田，原来有人计划改二三十万亩，有人则主张搞两三万亩，由于彼此都没有深入实际进行调查研究，两种意见无法统一。这次县委领导干部到基层以后，跟群众一起调查、商量，最后落实为十八万亩。群众对这个规划很满意。
    各县领导干部深深地感到，要使自己在群众中真正扎下根来，成为群众的贴心人，必须象焦裕禄那样，跟群众同呼吸共命运，急群众之所急，在群众最需要的时候，去关心群众，帮助群众。二月二十一日，苏北地区下了一场鹅毛大雪，各县的干部天不亮就冒雪到各社、队去检查群众生活和生产情况。淮阴县委副书记李道才在下雪那天晚上，他用电话逐个通知各公社做好防冻工作，到半夜还未入睡，第二天一早又踏雪奔赴公社检查工作。沭阳县委组织部长王风岭顶风冒雪，到全县最困难的茅圩公社官墩大队看望群众，他发现这个大队有些贫农下中农缺粮缺柴，立即到平墩大队跟干部、群众商量，平墩大队借出粮食、柴草，亲自送到官墩大队。各公社、大队、生产队和各行各业的干部，也都行动起来，深入群众中问寒问暖。有的社员感动地说：“现在的干部都成了咱们庄户人的贴心人啦！”
    各县干部们坚信，只要象焦裕禄那样，在群众中牢固地扎下根子，充分依靠群众，不要多少年，淮阴地区的低产多灾的面貌就能够改变。
