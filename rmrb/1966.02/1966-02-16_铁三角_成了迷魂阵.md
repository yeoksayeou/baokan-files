    “Iron Triangle” Becomes a Bewildering Maze
    Malcolm Browne, a Saigon-based reporter for the Associated Press, described the helplessness and extreme fear of the American invading forces towards the South Vietnamese people’s tunnel warfare in Chapter 3, "New Inventions of the Viet Cong," of his book, "The New Face of War." An excerpt is as follows:
    About twenty miles north of Saigon is an area consisting mainly of jungle and rubber plantations. The Americans call this area the "Iron Triangle." This is a wilderness area of roughly triangular shape, about one hundred square miles in size. Despite all efforts, it has been impossible to drive out the Viet Cong entrenched in this area.
    One reason is that the guerrillas have dug huge networks of tunnels throughout the area. The tunnels are interconnected, like a large maze, with a camouflaged ventilation opening to the surface every fifty yards or so.
    Various attempts to destroy the tunnel network have failed. Sometimes tanks can crush parts of the tunnels, but never all of them. Smoke generators powered by diesel engines pump smoke into the tunnels, but it never seems to smoke out all the enemy. Explosives have blown up large sections of the tunnels. Entrances and exits to the tunnels have been found under stoves in peasant huts and sealed off.
    However, the guerrillas continue to dig with mole-like ingenuity, and the tunnel network continues to expand.
    An American officer told me:
  “I wouldn’t be surprised if I found one of these damn tunnels leading right up to my desk in my office in Saigon.”
    This idea is a bit far-fetched, but not as impossible as it sounds.
    After World War II, the French colonial forces reoccupied Hanoi, the capital of North Vietnam. At the time, they had every reason to believe that Hanoi was militarily secure. But Ho Chi Minh's guerrillas gave the French a big surprise. One day, guerrillas poured into the center of Hanoi from a network of tunnels the French never knew existed, and Hanoi was suddenly at war.
    The Vietnamese guerrillas’ policy of digging tunnels has extended to every area they have reached, even if they are not fighting there. For years, the Viet Cong have built cleverly concealed fortifications in thousands of villages in case they might be needed one day. Rice paddy ridges that look perfectly ordinary are dotted with gun emplacements; inconspicuous holes in the corners of fields conceal machine guns; sniper nests are hidden in tall trees; even cemeteries have become huge networks of Viet Cong bunkers.
    Attacking Viet Cong tunnel networks is often a very laborious and bloody affair, causing heavy casualties among friendly forces (referring to the South Vietnamese puppet army). The tunnel networks are bound to be covered with thousands of camouflaged punji stake traps, another ingenious product of the Viet Cong. These traps are filled with sharpened, barbed stakes pointing upwards, which can easily penetrate the soles of military boots, causing the soldier who steps on it to suffer and lose his ability to fight.
    Recently, the Viet Cong claimed that they had dug three million such punji stake traps in just a small area of the Mekong Delta.
    Mines and booby traps hidden in the traps also made clearing the tunnels very difficult, and sniper fire always lurked at the tunnel vents.
    An injured American captain once told me: "One of them (referring to the guerrillas) stood up and shot at me. I saw him, fired a shot, but he ducked down just as I fired. I cautiously approached the place where he disappeared. It was at this moment that another bullet came from another place about fifty yards away. It was this second bullet that hit me. I believe it must have been the same sniper, using another vent.
    The entrances to the tunnels or armories are sometimes located below the surface of the water next to canals or ponds, and only those who know the way and can swim can find them.

### “铁三角”成了迷魂阵

    “铁三角”成了迷魂阵
    美联社驻西贡记者马耳可姆·布朗在他写的《战争新面貌》一书第三章《越共的新发明》中，描述了美国侵略军对南越人民地道战束手无策和万分惊恐的情况。摘要如下：
    西贡北面大约二十英里有一个主要是丛林和橡胶园的地区。美国人把这个地区叫做
  “铁三角”。这是面积一百平方英里左右大体上呈三角形的荒野地带。尽管做了一切努力，都无法把这个地区据守的越共赶走。
    一个原因是因为游击队在整个地区挖了巨大的地道网。地道互相连接，象个大迷魂阵，每隔五十码左右，就有一个伪装起来的通到地面的通风口。
    企图摧毁地道网的各种尝试都失败了。有时坦克可以压坏一部分地道，但是绝不能毁坏全部。由柴油机发动的烟雾发生机把烟注入地道，但好象从来也没有把所有的敌人熏出来。爆炸炸药曾经炸掉大段的地道。在农民茅屋里的灶底下发现过地道的进出口，并被封闭起来。
    但是，游击队用鼹鼠般的智慧继续挖掘，地道网还在不断扩大。
    有一个美国军官对我说：
  “如果我发现这个倒霉的地道中有一条一直通到我在西贡的办公室桌底下，我也不会感到吃惊。”
    这个想法有点牵强，但是并不象听起来那样不可能。
    第二次世界大战后，法国殖民军重新占领了北越的首都河内。当时，他们有种种理由认为河内在军事上是保了险的。但是胡志明的游击队给法国人来了一个大大的出其不意。有一天，游击队从法国人从来不知道的地道网涌入了河内的中心，顿时河内发生了战争。
    越南游击队的挖掘地道的政策扩及他们所到的每一地区，即使他们并不在那儿打仗。几年来，越共在数以千计的村庄里建筑了隐蔽巧妙的坚固工事，以防备有朝一日可以用上。看起来平平常常的稻田埂上，炮眼星罗棋布；田野角上的洞口并不引人注目，然而洞里却放着机关枪；高高的大树上藏着狙击手的窝巢；就连坟地也变成了越共巨大的掩体网。
    进攻越共地道网往往是非常吃力而又是血腥的事情，会造成友方（指南越伪军）的惨重伤亡。地道网上面和附近必然布满成千的伪装起来的钉签陷阱，这是越共的机智的另一种特产。这些陷阱里插着尖端朝上的带刺的钉签，很容易穿透军靴底，哪个士兵踩上它，就要吃苦头和丧失作战能力。
    最近越共宣称，光在湄公河三角洲的一小块地方，他们就挖设了三百万个这样的钉签陷阱。
    地雷和隐藏在陷阱中的炸弹也给清除地道带来了很大困难，而在地道的通风口总是埋伏着冷枪狙击手。
    有一次一个受伤的美军上尉告诉我说：“他们（指游击队）的一个人站起来向我射击。我看见了他，放了一枪，可是正当我开枪时他蹲了下去。我小心翼翼地向他隐没的地方逼近。正是这个时候，从大约五十码以外的另一个地方，另外一颗子弹飞了过来。打中我的就是这第二颗子弹。我相信一定还是同一个放冷枪的人，他利用了另一个通风口。
    地道口或者武器库的入口，有时是开在运河或者水塘旁边水面以下的地方，只有识路的会游水的人才能找得到。
