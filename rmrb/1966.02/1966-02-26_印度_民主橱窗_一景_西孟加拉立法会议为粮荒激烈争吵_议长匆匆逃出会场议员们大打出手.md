　　Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta, 23rd dispatch: Due to the incompetence of the Indian government and the ruling Congress Party on the grain issue, they tore off the mask of parliamentary democracy on the 22nd and adopted the practice of resorting to violence to suppress the opposition party's questioning of the government in the West Bengal Legislative Council.
　　According to the *Statesman*, when the West Bengal Legislative Council held a meeting on the 22nd, opposition party members questioned the government's policies, demanding that the government provide the people with sufficient grain, conduct a judicial investigation into the incident of the police in the Bengal region opening fire on anti-hunger demonstrators, and release the three opposition party members who were arrested during the anti-hunger demonstrations. According to the Indian constitution, members of parliament enjoy immunity.
　　The Speaker was unable to answer this serious demand and was unable to restore order in the clamorous parliament, so he announced a recess of ninety minutes and hurriedly fled the meeting. As soon as he left the meeting, a ruling party member slapped an opposition party member, and then the two sides started fighting in the meeting place.
　　Legislators fought each other, picking up books, ink bottles, and anything they could get their hands on and throwing them at each other. One legislator raised a table, another grabbed a microphone, and a third took off his shoes to use as weapons against the other.
　　As a result of this fierce conflict, six legislators were injured, one of whom was punched in the nose and bleeding, three were sent to the hospital, and some had their glasses smashed.

　　印度“民主橱窗”一景
　　西孟加拉立法会议为粮荒激烈争吵
　　议长匆匆逃出会场议员们大打出手
    新华社二十三日讯　加尔各答消息：印度政府和执政党国大党由于在粮食问题上的无能，二十二日扯破议会民主的假面具而采取了大打出手的作法来压制反对党在西孟加拉邦立法会议中对政府提出的质询。
    据《政治家报》报道，西孟加拉邦立法会议二十二日举行会议时，反对党议员对政府的政策提出质询，要求政府向人民提供足够的粮食、对在孟加拉地区警察向反饥饿示威者开枪事件进行司法调查、并释放在举行反饥饿示威时被逮捕的三个反对党议员。按印度宪法规定，议员是享有豁免权的。
    议长无法回答这一严正的要求，也无法恢复喧嚷的议会里的秩序，便宣布休会九十分钟，匆匆逃出会场。他刚一离开会场，一个执政党议员就一巴掌打了一个反对党议员，于是双方就在会场内大打起来。
    议员们互相对打，他们拿起书本、墨水瓶和他们所能拿到的任何东西向对方扔过去。有一个议员举起了桌子，另一个抓起了麦克风，第三个脱下了鞋子当武器来对付对方。
    这场激烈冲突的结果，六名议员受伤，其中一个被打得鼻子淌血，三个人被送进医院，有些人的眼镜被打得粉碎。
