    The "Sports News" published on the first page on the 8th short articles written by seven sports workers after studying the immortal deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, Chairman Mao's good student, describing the inspiration and education they received. Here are excerpts from their articles:
        If the Leadership Doesn't Revolutionize, It Can't Lead the Revolution
    After reading the immortal deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, I was once again deeply educated by Mao Zedong Thought. The more I read, the more I felt Comrade Jiao Yulu was great, and I was insignificant; the more I felt the enormous power of Mao Zedong Thought, the more I felt the ugliness of individualist thinking. If we can truly become good students of Comrade Mao Zedong like Comrade Jiao Yulu, then nothing can stump us, and we will definitely be able to complete the revolutionary tasks assigned to us by the Party and the people.
    There will be difficulties in doing work, and when there are difficulties, there must be struggle. Without struggle, difficulties cannot be overcome. The difficulties Comrade Jiao Yulu encountered in his work are incomparably greater than the difficulties we encounter in sports work. He led the people of the entire county to overcome the difficulties in a very short period of time. Why was he able to do this? Because he had the thorough proletarian revolutionary spirit that Chairman Mao often taught communists to have, with no thought of personal gain or loss, wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people, serving the Chinese people and the people of the world completely and thoroughly. This is what I should learn first.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds once again prove that only when a leading cadre is armed with Mao Zedong Thought and truly acts in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought can he correctly lead the work. If the leadership doesn't revolutionize, it can't lead the revolution. To revolutionize, one must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and strive to transform all one's non-proletarian thoughts.　Deputy Director of Hebei Provincial Sports Commission　Su Zhenqi
      Have "Revolution" in Your Mind, and the Masses in Your Heart
    Only with "revolution" in your mind and the masses in your heart is it possible to be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, to have the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, to be disinterested in fame or gain, unafraid of hardship or death, wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people, and also to have that kind of selfless revolutionary spirit to transform the subjective and objective world.
    Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, our working conditions are many times better, but we have not done a good job. If everyone learns his revolutionary spirit and studies and applies Chairman Mao's works in a living way, there is no need to worry about not doing a good job in sports work.
                              Deputy Director of Liaoning Provincial Sports Commission　Dong Lianbi
          First Grasp One's Own Living Thoughts
    The reason why Comrade Jiao Yulu was infinitely loyal to the revolution and dedicated himself to the people was the result of his studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way and arming his mind with the great Mao Zedong Thought. With the Chinese revolution and the world revolution in his heart, he will take the lead in everything on the battle post, set an example everywhere, and wholeheartedly serve the revolution. Sometimes I think I am old, weak, and unable to do it, which is unacceptable individualism. It doesn't matter if you are old, as long as your thinking is not old. To keep your thinking from getting old, you must study Chairman Mao's works with a revolutionary spirit. In the past, we learned to grasp the living thoughts of those below, not to grasp our own living thoughts. When studying Chairman Mao's works, we should first grasp our own living thoughts and transform the subjective world, so that it is easier to learn Mao Zedong Thought.
                                Director of Jilin Provincial Sports Commission　Liao Yunzhou
        Like Him, Read Chairman Mao's Books for Life
    After reading the reports about Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, I was deeply moved by his revolutionary qualities and received great education and inspiration. I initially compared myself with Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds and felt a great gap. First of all, I did not study Chairman Mao's works well, especially failing to study and apply them in a living way like him. The idea of serving the people wholeheartedly has not been fully established. I cannot do everything according to Chairman Mao's instructions, I cannot walk ahead of the masses, my class feelings with the masses are not deep, I do a poor job of going into the actual situation and doing research in my work, I am satisfied with a smattering of knowledge, and I lack the revolutionary spirit of Comrade Jiao Yulu to dedicate myself to the cause of the Party. I have a bit of a stomach problem, so I am worried, seeing Western doctors today and Chinese doctors tomorrow, and I complain when there is a little more work. Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of not fearing hardship or death, and wholeheartedly serving the revolution, I am truly ashamed.
    Through preliminary comparison, I deeply realized that as a Communist Party member, a revolutionary fighter, I must read Chairman Mao's books for life like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform myself for life.
                    Associate of the "August 1st" Sports Team　Liu Haiting
          Sweep Away All Selfish and Miscellaneous Thoughts
    Comparing myself with everything about Comrade Jiao Yulu, I feel that my degree of revolutionization is far behind. There are many aspects of him that are worth learning, the most important of which is the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the revolution, daring to make revolution, and being good at making revolution. I feel that what affects my progress and affects my learning from others is nothing else but my lack of a thorough revolutionary spirit, and my failure to demand myself with the high standards of a proletarian fighter. I want to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, and first of all, I must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, seriously transform my thinking, sweep away all selfish and miscellaneous thoughts, and establish the idea of thorough revolution.
                            Deputy Director of Jiangsu Provincial Sports Commission　Shen Zhandi
         Be Infinitely Loyal to the Revolution
    After reading the reports about Jiao Yulu's deeds, my mood could not be calmed for a long time, and I could not fall asleep all night. Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of infinite loyalty to the revolution and dedication to the people, I felt very deeply and was filled with guilt. As a leading cadre, if you want to do your job well, you must also solve the problem of serving the people, that is to say, you must use Mao Zedong Thought to transform your subjective world, and like Comrade Jiao Yulu, dedicate everything you have to the Party and the people.
                              Deputy Director of Shandong Provincial Sports Commission　Sun Jiwen
         To Do Revolution, One Must Be "Selfless"
    Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, I am far behind. I also have liver disease, but I don't have his high revolutionary spirit. Learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, I must start from this point, not be afraid of disease, overcome disease, and do a good job.

### 体育工作者积极向焦裕禄同志学习

    体育工作者积极向焦裕禄同志学习
    本报讯　《体育报》八日在一版刊登了七位体育工作者学习了毛主席的好学生焦裕禄的不朽事迹后写的短文，叙述了他们受到的激励和教育。现在将他们的文章摘要发表如下：
        领导不革命，就不能领导革命
    读了焦裕禄同志不朽的事迹后，又深深地受到一次毛泽东思想的教育。越读越觉得焦裕禄同志伟大，自己渺小；越读越感受到毛泽东思想的巨大威力，越觉得个人主义思想的丑恶。如果我们能象焦裕禄同志那样真正成为毛泽东同志的好学生，就什么也难不倒我们，就一定能完成党和人民交给我们的革命任务。
    做工作就会有困难，有困难就要斗争，不斗争，困难是克服不了的。焦裕禄同志工作中所遇到的困难，比起我们体育工作遇到的困难大得不可比拟，他在很短的时间里，领导全县人民把困难战胜了。为什么他能这样？因为他有毛主席经常教导共产党人应该具有的无产阶级彻底革命的精神，毫无个人得失之念，一心为革命，一心为人民，完全、彻底地为中国人民和世界人民服务。这是自己首先应该学习的。
    焦裕禄同志的事迹又一次证明：一个领导干部只有用毛泽东思想武装起来，真正按照毛泽东思想办事，才能够正确地领导好工作。领导不革命，就不能领导革命。要革命就要象焦裕禄同志那样活学活用毛主席著作，努力改造自己的一切非无产阶级思想。　河北省体委副主任　苏振起
      脑子里有“革命”，心里头有群众
    脑子里有了“革命”，心里头有了群众，才有可能做到象焦裕禄同志那样，具有无产阶级的彻底革命精神，做到不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民，也才有那种忘我的革命气魄去改造主客观世界。
    同焦裕禄同志比较起来，我们的工作条件不知要好多少倍，但是我们反而没有做好工作。如果大家都来学习他的革命精神，活学活用毛主席著作，就不愁搞不好体育工作。
                              辽宁省体委副主任　董连璧
          先抓自己的活思想
    焦裕禄同志之所以能对革命无限忠诚，为人民鞠躬尽瘁，是他活学活用毛主席著作，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装头脑的结果。心中有了中国革命和世界革命，在战斗岗位上就会事事带头，处处以身作则，一心一意为革命。我有时认为自己老了，身体弱了，不行了，这是要不得的个人主义。年纪大了没关系，只要思想不老就行，要使思想不老，就得带着革命精神学习毛主席著作。过去我们学了去抓下面的活思想，不抓自己的活思想，学习毛主席著作，应该先抓自己的活思想，改造主观世界，这样才比较容易学到毛泽东思想。
                                吉林省体委主任　廖运周
        象他那样终生读毛主席的书
    看了有关焦裕禄同志事迹的报道之后，深为他的革命品质所激动，受到很大的教育和启发。我以焦裕禄同志的事迹初步对照了自己，感到差距很大。首先是对毛主席著作学得不好，特别是未能象他那样活学活用。全心全意为人民服务的思想还未完全树立起来，不能事事按毛主席的指示去办，不能走在群众前头，同群众的阶级感情不深厚，在工作中，深入实际调查研究做的差，满足于一知半解，缺乏焦裕禄同志那种为党的事业鞠躬尽瘁的革命精神。自己有点胃病，就忧心忡忡，今天看西医，明天看中医，工作多一点就叫，同焦裕禄同志那种不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命的精神比较，真是惭愧极了。
    通过初步的对照，使我深深地认识到，作为一个共产党员，一个革命战士，必须象焦裕禄同志那样终生读毛主席的书，终生用毛泽东思想改造自己。
                    “八一”体育工作队协理员　刘海庭
          把一切私心杂念扫除掉
    以焦裕禄同志的一切，对照自己，感到自己革命化的程度差得太远了。他值得学习的方面很多，其中最主要的是一心为革命，敢于闹革命，善于闹革命的精神。我觉得，影响自己进步，影响自己向别人学习的，不是别的，就是自己缺乏彻底革命的精神，没能以无产阶级战士的高标准要求自己。我要向焦裕禄同志学习，首先要活学活用毛主席著作，认真改造自己的思想，把一切私心杂念扫除掉，树立彻底革命的思想。
                            江苏省体委副主任　沈战堤
         要对革命无限忠诚
    读完了关于焦裕禄事迹的报道，心情久久不能平静，彻夜未能入睡。和焦裕禄同志那种对革命无限忠诚，为人民鞠躬尽瘁的精神相比，感触很深，内心愧疚交织。作为一个领导干部，要想把自己的工作搞好，同样必须解决为人民服务的问题，也就是说，要用毛泽东思想来改造自己的主观世界，要象焦裕禄同志那样，把自己的一切献给党，献给人民。
                              山东省体委副主任　孙继文
         干革命就要“忘我”
    和焦裕禄同志相比，自己差得太远。我也有肝病，但却没有他那种高昂的革命精神。学习焦裕禄同志，我就要从这点做起，不怕疾病，战胜疾病，干好工作。
                                  陕西省体委　赵东璧
