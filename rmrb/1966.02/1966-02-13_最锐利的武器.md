    Learning from Chairman Mao's works lies in the word "use." The purpose of mastering them completely lies in application, so special efforts must be made on the word "use." Comrade Tang Aoqing said: "When using them, problems of this or that kind may arise due to insufficient understanding, but I never waver." This spirit is highly commendable.
    I am engaged in the study of theoretical chemistry. I began reading Chairman Mao's works in 1946 when I was studying abroad. From then until the early days of liberation, I read many of Chairman Mao's works, but because I didn't connect them with my own living thoughts and didn't pay attention to putting effort into the word "use," but often read them as general theoretical books, the effect was not good. Later, I gradually clarified the principle of studying for the revolution and linking theory with practice, and paid attention to studying with problems in mind (such as the criticism of resonance theory). I strive to act according to Mao Zedong Thought in practice. For example, after studying "Serve the People" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," I strive to understand Mao Zedong Thought in my work and overcome individualism. In the past, I was reluctant to do administrative work, fearing that it would affect my professional improvement, and regarded administrative work as an extra burden, which was obviously wrong for a revolutionary. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I gradually established the idea of serving the people. In 1956, I not only accepted the task of administrative work, but also actively strived to complete it. At the same time, I tried my best to play my role in teaching and scientific research. Chairman Mao pointed out that we must adhere to the system of cadres participating in collective productive labor, so I strive to do so according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In the past two years, my teaching and scientific research tasks have been relatively heavy, but I have been able to persist in participating in half a day of physical labor every week. Participating in labor is not an end in itself, but through labor, we cultivate the ideological feelings of the working people, cultivate the habit of labor, and narrow the distance between us and the working people in terms of ideological feelings and living habits. For another example, after studying Chairman Mao's instructions on training successors, I strive to highlight politics in teaching and scientific research, put politics first, set an example, and guide young people to study and exercise according to the five criteria and the requirements of being both red and expert. In natural science research, I also strive to act according to Chairman Mao's thought, and strive to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide my scientific research work. Although, when using it, problems of this or that kind may arise due to insufficient understanding, but I never waver. I believe that if I persist in this way, I will gradually truly learn Mao Zedong Thought in the practice of scientific research.
    Natural science research work must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is not only a sharp weapon for studying social sciences, but also a sharp weapon for studying natural sciences.
    I have done nearly 20 years of work in material structure and polymer physical chemistry. I have done more than 40 research projects, only two of which were done before returning to China, but the level was not high and the significance was not great. Now I am not willing to mention them. After returning to China, especially in the past ten years, I have grown relatively quickly in business, my research field has expanded, and I have done more systematically in one field, and it is more meaningful in theory and practice. This is entirely due to the education of the Party, and it is the result of consciously studying and applying Chairman Mao's philosophical thought. I now deeply realize that Chairman Mao's philosophical thought, materialist dialectics, is not only the theoretical weapon for the proletariat and the broad masses of people to carry out class struggle, but also the sharp ideological weapon for exploring nature. If a natural scientist can consciously study and apply Chairman Mao's philosophical thought, and consciously apply materialist dialectics in scientific research, he can discern the essence of things in the complex natural phenomena, find the best way to solve problems, take fewer or no detours, make continuous contributions in science, and accelerate the realization of the leap from the "realm of necessity" to the "realm of freedom."

    最锐利的武器
    吉林大学副校长　唐敖庆
    学习毛主席著作，贵在“用”字。精通的目的全在于应用，所以特别要在“用”字上狠下功夫。唐敖庆同志说：“在用的时候，也可能由于理解不深，因而出现这样那样的问题，但我从不动摇。”这种精神，大可提倡。
    我是研究理论化学的。我读毛主席著作，是从一九四六年在国外留学时开始的。从那时一直到解放初期，我看了毛主席的许多著作，但是由于没有同自己的活思想联系起来，没有注意在“用”字上下功夫，而往往是当着一般的理论书去读的，因此，效果不好。后来逐渐地明确了为革命而学、理论联系实际的原则，注意了带着问题学（如对共振论的批判）。我在实践中努力按照毛泽东思想办事，如学了《为人民服务》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，就努力在工作中体会毛泽东思想，克服个人主义思想。我过去不愿做行政工作，怕影响提高业务，把担任行政工作看成是额外的负担，这对一个革命者来说，显然是错误的。我学习了毛主席著作，逐步地树立起为人民服务的思想，一九五六年不仅接受了行政工作的任务，还积极努力去完成。同时尽力在教学、科学研究工作中发挥自己的作用。毛主席提出：必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度，我就努力按照毛主席的指示去做。近两年来我的教学、科学研究任务都比较重，我每周都能坚持参加半天的体力劳动。参加劳动本身不是目的，而是通过劳动，培养劳动人民的思想感情，培养劳动的习惯，在思想感情上、生活习惯上缩小同劳动人民的距离。又比如，我学习了毛主席关于培养接班人的指示后，我就在教学和科学研究中努力突出政治，把政治放在首位，以身作则，引导青年按照五条标准、按照又红又专的要求去学习、锻炼。在自然科学研究中，我也努力按照毛主席的思想办事，努力用毛泽东思想来指导自己的科学研究工作。虽然，在用的时候，也可能由于理解不深，因而出现这样那样的问题，但我从不动摇。我相信这样坚持下去，就会逐渐地在科学研究的实践中把毛主席思想真正学到手。
    自然科学研究工作，必须以毛泽东思想为指导，毛泽东思想不仅是研究社会科学的锐利武器，也是研究自然科学的锐利武器。
    我在物质结构和高分子物理化学方面做过近二十年的工作，先后做了四十多项研究工作，其中只有两项是回国前做的，但水平不高，意义不大，现在都不大愿意再提它了。我在回国后，特别是近十年内，业务上成长得比较快，研究领域扩充了，在一个领域内也做得比较系统，在理论和实践上也比较地有意义，这完全是在党的教育下得到的，是自觉地学习和运用毛主席哲学思想的结果。我现在深刻地体会到：毛主席的哲学思想，唯物辩证法，不但是无产阶级和广大人民群众进行阶级斗争的理论武器，也是探索自然界的锐利的思想武器。一个自然科学工作者如果能自觉地学习和运用毛主席的哲学思想，在科学研究中自觉地运用唯物辩证法，就能在纷繁复杂的自然现象中洞察事物的本质，找到解决问题的最好途径，少走或不走弯路，在科学上不断做出贡献，加速实现从“必然王国”向“自由王国”的飞跃。
