    Be a "Squad Leader" Like Jiao Yulu
    The conditions in Quanjiao are better than those in Lankao, but we haven't achieved the results we should have. The key lies in the lack of revolutionization of the county committee leadership, especially my failure to be a good "squad leader" like Comrade Jiao Yulu.
    I have repeatedly read "The Model County Party Secretary – Jiao Yulu" several times, and the more I read, the more restless I feel and the more intense the ideological struggle becomes.
    Looking at Lankao, thinking about Quanjiao, learning from Jiao Yulu, and reflecting on myself, there are considerable gaps in terms of ideology, work, and style. The conditions in Lankao were so difficult, but Comrade Jiao Yulu, with the fearless spirit of a revolutionary, waged a tenacious struggle against the "three pests" and created happiness for the people of Lankao. Quanjiao has mountains, embankments, and good people. It is a grain-producing area and is also suitable for developing diversified operations. There is much that can be done, but we have not achieved the results we should have. Where is the problem? The key lies in the lack of revolutionization of the leadership's ideology, especially me, the "squad leader" of the county committee, lacking the thorough revolutionary spirit of Comrade Jiao Yulu. In recent years, I have developed a mindset of seeking stability in my work. This stability lacks revolutionary drive and is based on considerations of "self." Things that can be done are not actively pursued, and I am daunted by certain temporary and localized difficulties. I dare not strive for advancement, fearing that taking too big a step will lead to problems. In my work, I only seek to get by, not to excel. This is actually the ideology of fearing revolution. This is letting down the Party and letting down the people.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu said, "Chewing on leftovers from others is tasteless." In order to grasp first-hand information and explore ways to change the backwardness of Lankao, he was so thorough and meticulous, and he had such a rigorous scientific attitude. To understand the demands of the masses, he talked with an old poor peasant for three days and three nights. In recent years, my mass viewpoint has weakened, I have done less investigation and research, and I lack first-hand material. Even when I understand some situations, I lack class analysis. Due to an undetailed work style, bureaucracy has grown, the democratic style is poor, and I feel uncomfortable and cannot listen to critical opinions.
    After learning from Jiao Yulu, I realized that as the "squad leader" of the county committee, to make everyone care about collective leadership and promote unity, I must be good at uniting, caring for, and inspiring comrades like Comrade Jiao Yulu. Learning this work style of Comrade Jiao Yulu, the first thing is to transform my own worldview. Comrade Jiao Yulu has set a shining example for me of serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly. I will definitely work hard to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's writings, continuously transform my subjective world with Mao Zedong Thought, and establish a worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly.

    要象焦裕禄那样当“班长”
    全椒比兰考的条件好，但是没有做出应有的成绩。关键在于县委领导没有革命化，特别是我自己还没有象焦裕禄同志那样当好“班长”。
    我反复读了数遍《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》，越读心里越不平静，思想斗争很激烈。
    看兰考，想全椒，学习焦裕禄，想自己，不论在思想上、工作上、作风上，差距都不小。兰考的条件那样艰苦，但是焦裕禄同志以革命者的大无畏精神，同“三害”作顽强斗争，为兰考人民创造了幸福。全椒有山、有圩、有好的群众，是粮产区，也适宜发展多种经营，是大有文章可作的地方，但是我们没有做出应有的成绩来。问题在哪里？关键在于领导思想没有革命化，特别是我这个县委的“班长”，缺乏焦裕禄同志那种彻底革命的精神。近几年，我在工作上产生了求稳的思想，这个稳是缺少革命干劲的稳，是从我字上考虑的稳。能办的事情不积极去办，为某些暂时的局部的困难吓倒，上游不敢争，怕步子跨大了出问题。工作上只求过得去，不求过得硬。这实际是不敢革命的思想。这是有愧于党，有愧于人民的。
    焦裕禄同志说：“吃别人嚼过的馍没味道”。为了掌握第一手资料，探索改变兰考落后面貌的道路，他是那样的深入细致，有那样严格的科学态度。他为了了解群众的要求，同一个老贫农谈了三天三夜。而我近几年来群众观点薄弱了，调查研究少了，缺乏第一手材料；了解一些情况，也缺乏阶级分析。由于工作作风不深入，滋长了官僚主义，民主作风差，听到批评意见，就感到不舒服，听不进去。
    学习了焦裕禄，我认识到作为县委的“班长”，要使大家关心集体领导，搞好团结，就要象焦裕禄同志那样善于团结、关心、启发同志。学习焦裕禄同志的这种工作作风，首先一条是要改造自己的世界观。焦裕禄同志为我树立了完全、彻底为人民服务的光辉榜样。我一定下苦功夫，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想不断改造我的主观世界，树立彻底为人民服务的世界观。
