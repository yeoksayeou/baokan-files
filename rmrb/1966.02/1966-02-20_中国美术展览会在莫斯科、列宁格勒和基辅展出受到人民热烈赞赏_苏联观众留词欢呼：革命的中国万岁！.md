    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th – The Chinese Art Exhibition, after being shown in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev for a total of over two months, closed in Kiev on February 11th.

    The exhibition was opened in Moscow on November 29th last year, according to the 1965 implementation plan of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Cooperation Agreement. The exhibition featured 117 pieces of Chinese paintings, propaganda posters, prints, and sculptures. These artworks depicted the life of the Chinese working people and their heroic spirit in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and also reflected the national liberation struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Many viewers praised these artworks in the guest book and gave them high evaluations.

    A viewer in Kiev said that through the exhibition, "I saw the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, fighting for the victory of Marxism-Leninism." A viewer in Moscow wrote, "You have pointed out the direction of artistic development with your distinct creations, and you have successfully expressed joyful creative labor, the spirit of defending the motherland and hating the enemy, and the unity of the Party and the people." A person in Leningrad who signed as "Your sincere engineer" wrote, "Dear Chinese friends, thank you for the ideas you expressed! Thank you for your paintings! You are great!" Another viewer wrote: "Excellent! It convincingly shows that the new life of the Chinese people has produced new art, and there is no doubt that socialism will triumph. This exhibition is a very good gift from the Chinese people to the people of Leningrad in 1966!"

    The Chinese paintings exhibited aroused great interest among the audience. A viewer in Moscow praised the Chinese paintings as wonderful, combining traditional national artistic techniques and skills with modern themes, expressing the life and struggle of the people of New China. He said, "I thank the Chinese painters, they are standing on the right path and are not imitating the decadent tendencies of the West."

    Some viewers especially liked the exhibited propaganda posters. One viewer said, "These works have very good skills, colors, combativeness and ideology, and they reflect the spirit of contemporary China." A retired worker in Kiev said, "Your propaganda posters fill people with confidence, I saw the strength of the Chinese people and the lofty spirit of internationalism." Some viewers enthusiastically wrote: "We are happy that Chinese painters are not standing outside of the struggling people. They stand with Vietnam, the Congo… and black people fighting for human rights." A viewer who signed as "Female Retiree" wrote, "The Chinese painters' propaganda posters and other works are excellent. I understand that the Chinese people are carrying out very arduous struggles and work to oppose the enemy and educate Chinese youth. I like the painting 'Study Chairman Mao's Writings and Cultivate Communist Successors' very much. This reminds me of Mayakovsky's propaganda posters, which called on us to be vigilant and fight for socialism."

    However, a small handful of people, at the instigation of others, used this cultural exchange occasion to deliberately engage in anti-China activities, and made accusations and slanders against the combative artworks reflecting the revolutionary struggles of the Chinese and other countries' people. For example, during the exhibition in Moscow, on the afternoon of December 13, a "viewer" took out a notebook and copied pre-prepared malicious anti-China sentences into the guest book. He falsely accused China of having "personal superstition" and also said that the Chinese people were "suffering"! Some people insisted on saying that the works depicting the Chinese people defending their country and the Vietnamese people resisting the US to save their country were "militaristic," "flaunting power," and a "threat to the United States." Another person, harboring a deep-seated hatred for the socialist system, wrote, "That's a show, almost the same as in the Stalin era, even worse, a sad sight!"

    However, these views and anti-China remarks were strongly refuted by many viewers in the same guest book. Some viewers used a red pen to heavily cross out these anti-China sentences and then wrote their own feelings, warmly praising the exhibition, and cheering: "Long Live Revolutionary China!" One viewer retorted: "The Chinese people are changing the backwardness of centuries in order to create everything new in their own country. Therefore, there is no such thing as 'a show' as written by those who have nothing to do and sneaked in here. … For his words, dear Chinese friends, please ignore it! Similarly, the so-called 'flaunting power' accusations of some pacifists are also stupid. This is a revolution, not a magic trick. Only the blind and stubborn cannot see the difference." Another viewer wrote: "The works are full of life, revolutionary spirit, and reflect a new life. If anyone denies the significance and role of this exhibition, that is a Philistine!"

    Many viewers also wrote enthusiastic and friendly words to the Chinese people and Chinese leaders in the guest book. One viewer said: "Please convey our heartfelt thanks to the Chinese leaders and all the Chinese people, thank you for these works with true artistry and revolutionary spirit." A person who had been to China thirty years ago wrote: "New China, I salute you! After thirty years of separation, it is difficult to recognize. Grow, blossom, rejoice!" An engineer wrote: "Great China, I wish you happiness and success!" A retired worker wrote, "Everyone is happy for the achievements of the brotherly Chinese people, long live the friendship between the people of our two countries!"

    中国美术展览会在莫斯科、列宁格勒和基辅展出受到人民热烈赞赏
    苏联观众留词欢呼：革命的中国万岁！
    新华社莫斯科十八日电 中国美术展览会在莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅先后展出共两个多月后，已经于二月十一日在基辅闭幕。
    展览会是根据中苏文化合作协定一九六五年执行计划于去年十一月二十九日在莫斯科开幕的。展览会上展出中国国画、宣传画、版画和雕塑共一百一十七件。这些艺术作品描绘了中国劳动人民的生活以及他们在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的英雄气概，也反映了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家人民的民族解放斗争。许多观众在留言簿上赞赏这些艺术作品，给予了很高的评价。
    基辅一位观众说，通过展览会，“我看到了中国人民在共产党的英明领导下，为了马克思列宁主义思想的胜利而进行的斗争”。莫斯科的一位观众写道，“你们以自己的鲜明创作指出了艺术的发展方向，你们成功地表现了愉快的创造性的劳动，表现了保卫祖国、仇恨敌人的气概，以及党和人民的团结”。列宁格勒一位署名为“你们的真挚的工程师”的人写道，“亲爱的中国朋友，谢谢你们所表达的思想！谢谢你们的绘画！你们是好样的！”另一位观众写道：“太好了！它很有说服力地表明：中国人民的新生活产生了新的艺术，毫无疑问，社会主义将取得胜利。这个展览会是中国人民在一九六六年里给列宁格勒人带来的一份很好的礼物！”
    展览会上展出的中国国画引起了观众浓厚的兴趣。莫斯科一位观众称赞中国的国画妙极了，它把传统的民族的艺术手法、技巧同现代题材结合起来，表现了新中国人民的生活和斗争。他说，“我感谢中国画家，他们站在正确的道路上，没有模仿西方那种堕落倾向。”
    有的观众特别喜欢展出的宣传画。一位观众说，“这些作品具有很好的技巧、色彩、战斗性和思想性，它们反映了当代中国的精神。”基辅的一位退休工人说，“你们的宣传画令人感到信心百倍，我看到了中国人民的力量和崇高的国际主义精神。”有的观众热情地写道：“使我们高兴的是，中国画家没有站在斗争的人民之外。他们和越南、刚果……和争取人权的黑人站在一起”。一位署名“女退休者”的观众写道，“中国画家们的宣传画和其他作品都好极了。我懂得了中国人民为了反对敌人，为了教育中国青年，进行着非常艰巨的斗争和工作。我很喜欢‘学习毛主席著作，培养共产主义接班人’这幅画。这使我记起了马雅可夫斯基的宣传画，它号召我们提高警惕，为社会主义而斗争。”
    但是，也有一小撮人在别人的唆使下，利用这个文化交流的场合蓄意进行反华活动，并对反映中国和其他各国人民革命斗争的充满战斗性的艺术作品发出责难和诬蔑。例如，当展览会在莫斯科展出期间，十二月十三日下午，就有一个“观众”掏出笔记本，把事先拟好的恶毒的反华词句抄到留言簿上。他诬蔑中国有“个人迷信”，还说什么中国人民“正在受难”！有人硬把描写中国人民保家卫国和越南人民抗美救国斗争的作品说成是“军国主义的”，是“耀武扬威”，是“对美国的威胁”。另一个人则抱着对社会主义制度的刻骨仇恨写道，“那是装样子的，几乎同斯大林时期一样，甚至还要坏得多，可悲的景象！”
    但是，这些观点和反华言论，在同一个留言簿上就受到了许多观众的有力批驳。有的观众用红笔在这些反华词句上狠狠地抹上几道，然后写下自己的观感，热情地赞扬这个展览会，并且欢呼：“革命的中国万岁！”一位观众批驳说：“中国人为了在自己的国家创造一切新的东西，正在改变着几世纪以来的落后面貌。因此，这里根本不存在象前面那些没有事干而溜到这里来的人所写的什么‘装样子’。……对于他的话，亲爱的中国朋友们，请不要去理它！同样，某些和平主义者的所谓‘耀武扬威’的责难也是愚蠢的。这是革命，而不是变戏法。只有瞎子和顽固不化的人才看不到其间的区别”。另一位观众写道：“作品充满生活气息、革命精神，反映了新生活。如果有人否认这个展览会的意义和作用，那就是庸人！”
    许多观众在留言簿上还写下了对中国人民和中国领导人的热情友好的语言。一位观众说：“请转达我们对中国领导人和全中国人民的衷心的感谢，感谢这些作品具有真正的艺术性和革命精神。”一位三十年前曾到过中国的人写道：“新中国，向你致敬！阔别三十年后，已经很难辨认了。生长吧，开花吧，欢乐吧！”一位工程师写道：“伟大的中国，祝你幸福并取得成就！”一位退休工人写道，“大家都为兄弟的中国人民的成就感到高兴，我们两国人民的友谊万岁！”
