    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from Calcutta: Over ten thousand civil servants and students in Calcutta held an anti-hunger demonstration on the 16th, demanding that the Indian government guarantee food supply.
    According to Western news agencies, when students were demonstrating in front of the Barasat court in the suburbs of Calcutta, police brutally opened fire to suppress them, injuring fifty people and arresting many.
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from New Delhi: The authorities in Kerala, India, continue to brutally suppress students and teachers participating in the anti-hunger struggle that began on January 28th. Their barbaric atrocities have aroused great public anger.
    According to a report in the *Link* weekly on the 13th, police used iron-wrapped clubs and tear gas to attack demonstrating students. In Balaramapuram, a suburb of Trivandrum, police broke down classroom doors, smashed desks and blackboards, and fractured a teacher's skull.
    In Quilon, a police force arrived at the Sree Narayana College in six prison vans, attacking students with iron-wrapped clubs and using force. In Kottayam, police stormed a student dormitory and beat students.
    According to recent reports in Indian newspapers, students at Sree Narayana College and some students in other parts of Kerala held one-day hunger strikes on the 9th and 10th respectively, demanding that the police who committed the atrocities be punished. They also demanded the release of all students arrested in the anti-hunger strike and an increase in food rations.
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from New Delhi: The *Hindustan Times* reported on the 17th that the Indian Minister of State for Home Affairs, Jaisukhlal Hathi, revealed in the People's House on the 16th that as of January 1st this year, 3,030 people were still detained under the "Defense of India Act," including 67 members of state legislative assemblies or parliaments.
      The "Defense of India Act" is a reactionary decree passed by the Indian Congress Party government after launching a large-scale armed invasion of China in 1962 to suppress the Indian people and trample on their basic rights. According to this decree, the Indian government can arbitrarily arrest, secretly interrogate, and execute so-called "violators" of this decree.
    In his speech, Hathi also tried his best to justify this reactionary measure of the Indian government to suppress the Indian people under the pretext of "national security being threatened by foreign forces." (Attached picture)

    新华社十七日讯　加尔各答消息：加尔各答一万多名公务人员和学生十六日举行反饥饿示威，要求印度政府保证粮食供应。
    据西方通讯社报道，当学生们在加尔各答郊区巴塞哈特法院前面举行示威时，警察残暴地开枪镇压，有五十人受伤，许多人被逮捕。
    新华社十八日讯　新德里消息：印度喀拉拉邦当局继续残酷镇压参加一月二十八日开始的反饥饿斗争的学生和教师。他们的野蛮暴行激起了公众的极大愤怒。
    据《联系》周刊十三日报道：警察使用包铁警棍和催泪弹攻击示威的学生。在特里凡得琅郊外的巴尔拉马普兰警察撞开教室的门，捣毁书桌和黑板，一名教师被打断了颅骨。
    在奎隆，警察部队乘坐六辆囚车开到斯里纳拉亚纳学院，用包铁警棍袭击学生和使用武力。在科塔延，警察冲进一所学生宿舍，殴打学生。
    据印度报纸最近报道，斯里纳拉亚纳学院的学生和喀拉拉邦其他地方的一些学生九日和十日分别举行一天绝食斗争，要求对施行暴行的警察给予惩办。他们还要求释放在反饥饿罢课中所逮捕的全部学生，增加粮食配给量。
    新华社十七日讯　新德里消息：《印度斯坦时报》十七日报道：印度内政部国务部长贾伊苏克拉尔·哈蒂十六日在人民院透露，在今年一月一日，根据“保卫印度法”被拘留的还有三千零三十人，其中六十七人是邦立法会议或议会的议员。
      “保卫印度法”是印度国大党政府在一九六二年对中国发动大规模武装侵略后，通过的一项镇压印度人民和践踏人民基本权利的反动法令。根据这项法令，印度政府可以任意逮捕、秘密审讯和处死所谓
  “触犯”这个法令的人。
    哈蒂在发言中还竭力借口
  “国家安全受到外来威胁”，为印度政府这一镇压印度人民的反动措施进行辩护。（附图片）
