　　US Military Procurement Fever Causes Production Imbalance
    Shortage of Certain Raw Materials, Civilian Production Forced to Contract
    Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd dispatch from New York: The US Department of Defense is stepping up its orders for large quantities of war materials to meet the needs of the increasingly expanding war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The February 21st issue of the "U.S. News & World Report" magazine quoted official sources as saying that in the first half of this year, the US military is expected to issue orders worth a total of 20 billion US dollars in weapon procurement, research and development of new weapons, and military construction projects, an increase of about 70% over the first half of last year. Among them, the total expenditure for purchasing aircraft, guns, artillery shells, bombs, trucks, and other military equipment is worth about 14.6 billion US dollars, almost double that of the same period last year. During the same period, the Department of Defense will also order food, clothing, and other military supplies worth billions of US dollars.
    The magazine emphasized that "if the Vietnam War expands beyond its currently projected scale, military orders will increase further."
    The magazine pointed out that "the aircraft industry, which was recently in a slump, is now busy with production... operating two or three shifts a day." West Coast aircraft manufacturing giants (including Boeing, Douglas, Lockheed, and Northrop) "are receiving increasing numbers of military orders for transport planes and fighter jets."
    The magazine anxiously stated that the current "military procurement boom is having an impact (on the US economy), and this impact is expected to be even greater in the coming months." It pointed out that the continuous increase in military orders has already caused shortages of certain raw materials and certain business sectors being overwhelmed. According to estimates made by some "industrial observers" that it quoted, if military orders increase significantly, the automobile industry, which is currently operating at a capacity utilization rate of about 90%, will have to compress civilian production.

### 美国军火采购热引起生产失调  某些原料供应不足　民用生产被迫压缩

　　美国军火采购热引起生产失调
    某些原料供应不足　民用生产被迫压缩
    新华社二十三日讯　纽约消息：美国国防部正加紧订购大批战争物资，供应侵越战争日益扩大的需要。
    二月二十一日一期的《美国新闻与世界报道》周刊引官方公布的材料说，今年上半年内，美国军方在武器采购、研究和发展新式武器以及军事建筑工程等方面预计将发出总值二百亿美元的订单，比去年上半年多百分之七十左右。其中，用于采购飞机、枪炮、炮弹、炸弹、卡车及其他军用器材的开支总和约值一百四十六亿美元，几乎比去年同期增加一倍。同期内，国防部还将订购总值数十亿美元的食品、服装和其他军需物资。
    这家周刊强调说，“如果越南战争扩大到超出目前预计的规模，军事订货还将进一步增加。”
    这家周刊指出，“不久前还陷于萧条的飞机工业，现在生产繁忙……。每天要开工两、三班”。西海岸的飞机制造业巨头（包括波音、道格拉斯、洛克希德和诺斯罗普等公司在内），“正在接获越来越多的购买运输机和战斗机的军事订单”。
    这家周刊不安地谈到，目前的“军火采购热潮正在（对美国经济）发生影响，而且这种影响预料在今后几个月里还会更大”。它指出，军事订货的不断增加已经引起某些原料供不应求和某些企业部门应接不暇的现象。据它引某些“工业观察家”所作估计，如果军事订货大量增加，当前开工率已达百分之九十左右的汽车工业，将不得不压缩民用生产。
