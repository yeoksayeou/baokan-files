    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 2nd -- Shanghai has recently manufactured a new type of high-temperature resistant plastic. When made into a thin film, this plastic does not melt even when baked at a high temperature of 200 degrees Celsius, and it can maintain high-voltage insulation performance.
    This newly manufactured high-temperature resistant plastic is also called a new type of high-temperature resistant resin. When enameled wire made from it is wound on a motor, it can ensure that the motor can operate normally at a high temperature of 180 degrees Celsius.

    上海制成新型耐高温树脂
    据新华社上海二日电　上海新近制成一种耐高温的塑料。这种塑料做成薄膜，放在摄氏二百度高温热下烘烤也不熔化，而且能够保持耐高电压的绝缘性能。
    新制成的这种耐高温塑料，又叫新型耐高温树脂。用它做的漆包线绕制在电机上，可以保证电机在摄氏一百八十度高温下能正常运转。
