    According to Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 8th: According to reports from Seoul cited by Pyongyang newspapers, South Korean workers employed by U.S. aggressor troop agencies are continuing their struggle.

    According to reports, more than 1,100 workers in the Paju area of Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, who initiated an indefinite strike on the 5th, held a sit-in in front of the local U.S. aggressor troop base on the 7th to protest the U.S. aggressor troops' barbaric suppression of workers.

    Prior to the sit-in, the workers held a rally, established a struggle committee, and put forward five demands, including requiring the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army to issue a public apology to the workers, immediately reinstate the workers who were unjustly dismissed, severely punish the murderers who bloodily suppressed the workers' struggle and the U.S. officers who ordered the suppression of workers, and compensate the workers for the losses incurred during the suppression.

    The report stated that in order to sabotage the workers' struggle, the U.S. and Park Chung-hee clique are resorting to deceptive tactics such as asking the workers to "go back to work first and negotiate later," a plot that has been resolutely rejected by the workers.

    According to another report, representatives of over 30,000 South Korean workers employed by U.S. aggressor troop agencies issued a statement on the 7th stating that if the U.S. aggressor troop authorities do not meet the demands of the workers in the Paju area by the 12th, they will all stage a sympathy strike and engage in "self-defense struggle." They also lodged a strong protest with the commander of the U.S. forces stationed in South Korea, condemning the U.S. aggressor troops' crimes of suppressing the workers' struggle in the Paju area.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 6th: Newspapers here cited news from Seoul, South Korea, on the 6th, reporting that U.S. aggressor military police occupying South Korea barbarously stabbed eight striking South Korean workers with bayonets on the 5th.

    According to reports, more than 1,100 South Korean workers in the Paju area of Gyeonggi Province, belonging to the U.S. aggressor troops' "Korean Labor Corps," staged a collective strike to oppose the U.S. aggressors' national persecution and the U.S.-Park Chung-hee clique's cruel exploitation, and to demand improved living conditions.

    When the workers, holding up large banners condemning the U.S. aggressors' cruel exploitation, demonstrated at the base of the U.S. aggressor Second Infantry Division, the U.S. aggressor troop authorities dispatched more than 40 fully armed military police and 50 mercenaries to brutally suppress the demonstrating workers. They threw tear gas at the unarmed workers and violently beat and stabbed them with rifle butts and bayonets, seriously injuring eight workers on the spot.

    The angry workers, undeterred by the enemy's bloody suppression, bravely charged towards the U.S. aggressor troops' camp. Subsequently, the workers held a sit-in in front of the U.S. military base, condemning the U.S. aggressors' brutal crimes and demanding that the murderers be punished.

    The Park Chung-hee clique, the loyal running dogs of U.S. imperialism, were extremely alarmed by the workers' resistance struggle. While shielding the U.S. aggressors' atrocities, they dispatched armed military police to the scene, arrested a number of workers, and conducted fascist "interrogations."

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 7th: The Central Committee of the Korean Professional General League issued a statement on the 6th, strongly condemning the U.S. aggressor troops' bloody suppression of South Korean workers and firmly supporting the South Korean workers' just struggle.

    The statement said that the U.S. aggressor troops' bloody suppression of the worker's struggle in the Paju area on the 5th is a blatant trampling on the South Korean people's right to survival and another serious crime against the Korean nation.

    The statement called on all South Korean workers to unite and resolutely struggle to the final victory to drive out the U.S. aggressors and overthrow the Park Chung-hee traitorous clique, and to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    美国侵略军杀伤南朝鲜罢工工人的暴行激起强烈愤怒
    南朝鲜工人坚决斗争要求严惩凶手
    朝鲜职业总同盟强烈谴责美军的血腥镇压
    据新华社平壤八日电　据平壤报纸援引汉城消息说，美国侵略军机关雇佣的南朝鲜工人继续进行斗争。
    据报道，五日举行无限期罢工的南朝鲜京畿道坡州地区的一千一百多名工人，七日到当地美国侵略军部队驻地门前举行静坐斗争，抗议美国侵略军镇压工人的野蛮暴行。
    工人们在静坐斗争之前，举行了集会，成立了斗争委员会，并且提出了五项要求，要求美国第八军司令向工人公开道歉，立即让被无理解雇的工人复职；严惩血腥镇压工人斗争的凶手和向他们下令对工人进行镇压的美国军官；赔偿在镇压时受伤的工人的损失。
    报道说，美国、朴正熙集团为了破坏工人斗争，正在玩弄所谓工人“先上班，后协商”的欺骗手段，这一阴谋遭到了工人的坚决拒绝。
    另据报道，美国侵略军机关雇佣的三万多名南朝鲜工人的代表，七日发表声明说，如果美国侵略军当局十二日以前不答应坡州地区工人的要求，他们将全体举行同情罢工，进行“自卫斗争”。他们还向驻南朝鲜美军司令提出强烈抗议，谴责美国侵略军镇压坡州地区工人斗争的罪行。
    据新华社平壤六日电　据这里报纸六日援引南朝鲜汉城消息报道，霸占南朝鲜的美国侵略军宪兵五日竟野蛮地用刺刀刺伤了八名正在罢工的南朝鲜工人。
    据报道，美国侵略军所属的“韩国劳务团”京畿道坡州地区的一千一百多名南朝鲜工人，为反对美国侵略者的民族迫害和美国—朴正熙集团的残酷剥削和要求改善生活，举行集体罢工。
    当工人们高举着谴责美国侵略者残酷剥削的大幅标语，在美国侵略军第二步兵师的驻地举行示威时，美国侵略军当局竟出动了四十多名全副武装的宪兵和五十多名雇佣军对示威工人进行野蛮镇压。他们对手无寸铁的工人投掷催泪弹，并且用枪托和刺刀向示威工人狠打乱刺。当场使八名工人身受重伤。
    愤怒的工人们不畏敌人的血腥镇压，奋不顾身地冲向美国侵略军的军营。接着，工人们在美军驻地前举行了静坐斗争，谴责美国侵略者的残暴罪行，并且要求惩办凶手。
    美帝国主义的忠实走狗朴正熙集团对工人们的反抗斗争非常惊慌，他们一面庇护美国侵略者的暴行，一面出动武装军警赶往现场，逮捕了一批工人，并进行法西斯“审讯”。
    新华社平壤七日电　朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会六日发表声明，强烈谴责美国侵略军对南朝鲜工人的血腥镇压，坚决支持南朝鲜工人的正义斗争。
    声明说，美国侵略军五日对坡州地区工人斗争的血腥镇压，是对南朝鲜人民生存权利的粗暴践踏，是对朝鲜民族的又一严重罪行。
    声明号召全体南朝鲜工人团结一致，为赶走美国侵略者和打倒朴正熙卖国集团，为实现祖国的自主和平统一，坚决斗争到最后胜利。
