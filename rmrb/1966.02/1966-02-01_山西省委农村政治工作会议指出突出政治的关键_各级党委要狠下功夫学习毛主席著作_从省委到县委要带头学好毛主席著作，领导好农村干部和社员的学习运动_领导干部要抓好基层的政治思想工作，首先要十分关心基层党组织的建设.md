    Editor's Note: Where lies the key to highlighting politics in rural work? The key lies in whether the Party committees at all levels have worked hard in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, whether they act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and whether they adhere to the principle of politics commanding everything.
    The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee pointed out: Taking the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works from the provincial Party committee to the county Party committee is a prerequisite for highlighting politics in all work. This is based on experience.
    We hope that comrades of the Party committees at all levels can create a strong atmosphere of studying Mao Zedong Thought and study Chairman Mao's works well. Our political work is the work of arming the broad masses of cadres, Party members, and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. If comrades of the Party committees at all levels achieve more in studying Chairman Mao's works, our political work will also achieve more; the greater the achievement in studying Chairman Mao's works, the greater the achievement in our political work.

    According to the Shanxi Daily, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee held a rural political work conference in mid-January, using Chairman Mao's remarks on political and ideological work as weapons, reviewed the province's rural political and ideological work, and discussed how to further carry out the movement to study Chairman Mao's works extensively and learn from the People's Liberation Army's political work experience.
    Since the Eighth Central Committee's Tenth Plenary Session, the rural political work in Shanxi Province has been strengthened; after the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee instructed the province to systematically establish rural political work in April 1965, political work has further developed. Political work organizations have been initially established from the province to the work teams, and some work has been done. At present, the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works in the province's rural areas has begun to take shape, and some advanced units and individuals who creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works have emerged.
    The meeting believed that although rural political work has been strengthened, it has not truly achieved what Chairman Mao instructed, that politics is the commander and the soul, and that politics must be highlighted in all work; it has not truly learned the most essential experience of the People's Liberation Army; and it has not worked hard enough on the "application" of studying Chairman Mao's works. Moreover, the leadership of a considerable number of units lags behind the masses. The rural political work team has not yet been systematically rectified and trained, and there are phenomena of being weak, incomplete, impure, and not grasping political work. How to strengthen the regular political work in rural areas has not yet formed a set of mature experiences.
    The meeting believed that the primary reason why the province's rural political work is not strong enough is that the Party's rural committees at all levels have not worked hard enough in studying Chairman Mao's works. Highlighting politics means highlighting Mao Zedong Thought. Only by studying Chairman Mao's works well can we achieve politics commanding everything. Secondly, a considerable number of comrades in the Party's rural committees at all levels have not truly straightened out the relationship between political and ideological work and other work in their thinking. Thirdly, the Party's rural committees at all levels handle too many administrative affairs. The provincial, prefectural, and county levels are not revolutionary enough, and the phenomenon of "five excesses" is still relatively serious, which has impacted political work.
    Comrade Wei Heng, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, made a summary report in the later stage of the meeting, putting forward four suggestions on how to truly highlight politics in the future:
    First, from the provincial Party committee to the county Party committee, we must first take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works well, and we must lead the movement of the vast number of rural cadres, Party members, and commune members to study Chairman Mao's works. We must regard Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instructions for all our work. This is a prerequisite for highlighting politics and letting politics command everything. The biggest enemy in learning at present is empiricism, doing things based on experience and relying on experience to make a living. This is a very dangerous phenomenon. The Provincial Party Committee emphasizes that studying Chairman Mao's works should be placed at the top of all work. The Provincial Party Committee will regularly check the study of Chairman Mao's works by leading cadres above the county Party Secretary level, and will also hold reading sessions for prefectural Party secretaries and responsible cadres of provincial departments to truly institutionalize the study of Chairman Mao's works by leading cadres. At the same time, we must strengthen the leadership of the study of Chairman Mao's works in rural areas, and regard arming the vast number of cadres, Party members, and commune members with Mao Zedong Thought as the most fundamental strategic task of our Party in rural areas, as the foundation for consolidating and developing rural people's communes, developing agricultural production, realizing agricultural modernization, and building a new socialist countryside. To this end, in addition to requiring county and prefectural Party committees to regularly pay attention to training study tutors and summarizing and promoting the experience of studying Chairman Mao's works, the Provincial Party Committee will hold a meeting of activists in studying Chairman Mao's works every year to exchange learning experiences and improve the level of tutors. In terms of learning methods, we must work hard on the "application." According to Chairman Mao's works, we must arrange, inspect, and summarize work, examine our own thoughts and actions, and use Chairman Mao's works as weapons to transform our thoughts and style, and improve our work.
    Second, vigorously grasp the revolutionization of the Party committees at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels. This is the key to highlighting politics. The Party committee is the command headquarters for political work. If the command headquarters is revolutionized, there will be a guarantee for highlighting politics. Among the Party committees, the primary requirement is that the main responsible comrades personally grasp political and ideological work. The Provincial Party Committee has determined that the top and second leaders from the Provincial Party Committee to the Party branch committee of the production brigade must personally grasp political and ideological work and grasp the revolutionization of the Party committee organs themselves. As for the leadership of various administrative departments, in addition to political and ideological work, policies, the allocation of key cadres, and major plans that must be submitted to the Party committee meeting for collective discussion, routine administrative work should be handled by the relevant departments.
    Third, counties and urban suburbs that have already been and are undergoing socialist education, in particular, should study and apply Chairman Mao's works conscientiously and thoroughly. In this regard, they should take the lead and actively and gradually accumulate and summarize more complete and mature experiences.
    Fourth, leading cadres should face the grassroots and earnestly grasp the political and ideological work at the grassroots level. First of all, we must be very concerned about the construction of the grassroots Party organization itself. We must always pay attention to examining, educating, and training the leading backbone of the branch, and ensure that the leadership of the Party branch is in the hands of true and excellent Marxist-Leninists. We must take the promotion of the Party's three major work styles as the center, and continuously improve the level of awareness of the vast number of Party members and the combat effectiveness of the Party branch. The rural grassroots political work team must be rectified. The conditions for grassroots political workers should be: being loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, wholeheartedly serving the people, being able to unite the vast majority of people to work together, and having a democratic work style and a spirit of self-criticism. That is: having a firm position, high awareness, being able to guide the vast number of cadres and the masses to adhere to the correct political direction, and being able to correctly implement the Party's policies; being good at leading the masses to correctly use struggle tactics to fight against class enemies; having a good ideological style, and being able to closely link with the masses. The existing grassroots political workers should be reviewed according to these conditions. For those who need to be adjusted, full democracy should be promoted, and commune members should hold another election. At the same time, some necessary political and ideological work systems should also be established to promote the regularization of political and ideological work and promote the continuous revolutionization of the thinking of cadres, Party members, and commune members.

    山西省委农村政治工作会议指出突出政治的关键
    各级党委要狠下功夫学习毛主席著作
    从省委到县委要带头学好毛主席著作，领导好农村干部和社员的学习运动
    领导干部要抓好基层的政治思想工作，首先要十分关心基层党组织的建设
    编者按：农村工作能不能突出政治，关键在哪里呢？关键在于党的各级委员会，是不是在活学活用毛主席著作上下了狠功夫，是不是按照毛主席的指示办事，坚持以政治统帅一切。
    山西省委指出：从省委到县委，首先带头学好毛主席著作，是在一切工作中突出政治的先决条件。这是经验之谈。
    我们希望，党的各级委员会的同志，能够把学习毛泽东思想的空气搞得浓浓的，把毛主席的著作学得好好的。我们的政治工作，就是用毛泽东思想武装广大干部、党员和群众的工作。各级党委会的同志在学习毛主席著作上多了一分成绩，我们的政治工作也就会多一分成绩；在学习毛主席著作上的成绩越大，我们的政治工作的成绩也就会越大。
    据山西日报报道　中共山西省委一月中旬召开了农村政治工作会议，以毛主席关于政治思想工作的言论为武器，检查了全省农村的政治思想工作，讨论了如何进一步开展大学毛主席著作的运动，把解放军的政治工作经验学到手。
    从党的八届十中全会以来，山西省农村政治工作有所加强；一九六五年四月，山西省委指示全省系统地建立农村政治工作以后，政治工作又有了进一步的发展。从省到作业组初步建立了政治工作机构，并做了一些工作。目前全省农村群众性学习毛主席著作的运动，已经初具规模，出现了一些活学活用毛主席著作的先进单位和先进人物。
    会议认为，尽管农村政治工作有了加强，但是并没有真正做到毛主席所指示的，政治是统帅，是灵魂，在一切工作上突出政治；并没有把解放军最本质的经验学到手；学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫不够。而且，相当一部分单位领导落后于群众。农村政治工作队伍，还没有进行系统的整顿和训练，有不力、不齐、不纯、不抓政治工作的现象。如何加强农村经常的政治工作，还没有形成一套成熟的经验。
    会议认为，全省农村政治工作不够过硬的首要原因，是党的农村各级委员会，在学习毛主席著作上狠下功夫不够。突出政治，就是突出毛泽东思想。只有学习好毛主席著作，才可能做到政治统帅一切。其次，党的农村各级委员会中，还有相当一部分同志，没有真正从思想上摆正政治思想工作和其它工作的关系。再次，党的农村各级委员会包揽行政事务过多。省、地、县三级革命化不够，“五多”现象仍然比较严重，冲击了政治工作。
    中共山西省委第一书记卫恒同志在会议后期作了总结报告，对今后如何真正做到突出政治，提出了四点意见：
    第一、从省委到县委，首先要带头学好毛主席著作，要领导好农村广大干部、党员和社员群众学习毛主席著作的运动，要把毛主席的书当作我们各项工作的最高指示，这是做到突出政治，以政治统帅一切的先决条件。目前学习上的最大敌人是经验主义，凭经验办事，凭经验吃饭。这是一种十分危险的现象。省委强调要把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。省委要定期检查县委书记以上领导骨干学习毛主席著作的情况，并要举办地委书记和省级各部门负责干部的读书会，使领导干部学习毛主席著作真正形成制度。同时，要加强对农村学习毛主席著作的领导，把用毛泽东思想武装广大干部、党员和社员群众，作为我们党在农村最根本的战略任务，作为巩固和发展农村人民公社，发展农业生产，实现农业现代化和建设社会主义新农村的根本。为此，除要求县委、地委要经常注意培养学习辅导员，总结推广学习毛主席著作的经验外，省委每年要召开一次学习毛主席著作积极分子会议，交流学习经验，提高辅导员的水平。在学习方法上，要在“用”字上狠下功夫。根据毛主席的著作，布置、检查和总结工作，检查自己的思想和行动，以毛主席著作为武器，改造思想和作风，改进工作。
    第二、狠抓省、地、县三级党委的革命化，这是突出政治的关键所在，党委会是政治工作的司令部，司令部革命化了，突出政治就有了保证。党委会中又首先要求主要负责同志，要亲自抓政治思想工作。省委确定，从省委到生产大队党支部委员会的第一把手和第二把手，要亲自抓政治思想工作，抓党委机关本身的革命化。至于对各行政业务部门的领导，除政治思想工作，方针政策，主要干部的配备，重大计划，要提交党委会议集体讨论外，日常行政工作，应交给有关部门去处理。
    第三、已经和正在进行社会主义教育的县和城市郊区，尤其要把学习毛主席著作扎扎实实地学好用好。在这方面应当走前一步，积极地逐步地积累和总结出比较完整的和成熟的经验。
    第四、领导干部要面向基层，切实抓好基层的政治思想工作。首先要十分关心基层党组织自身的建设。要经常注意考察、教育、培养支部领导骨干，保证党支部的领导权掌握在真正的优秀的马克思列宁主义者手中。要以发扬党的三大作风为中心，不断提高广大党员的觉悟水平和党支部的战斗力。农村基层政治工作队伍要进行整顿。基层政治工作人员的条件应该是：忠实于毛泽东思想，全心全意为人民服务，能够团结绝大多数人一道工作，有民主作风和自我批评精神。也就是：立场稳、觉悟高，能够引导广大干部和群众坚持正确的政治方向，能够正确贯彻执行党的方针、政策；善于领导群众正确运用斗争策略，向阶级敌人进行斗争；思想作风好，能够密切联系群众。现有基层政治工作人员，应该根据这些条件进行审查。需要调整的，要充分发扬民主，由社员群众另行选举。同时，还要建立一些必要的政治思想工作制度，以促进政治思想工作的经常化，促进干部党员和社员群众思想的不断革命化。
