    Revolutionary Style Spreads Everywhere
    Xie Ding
    Editor's Note: The noble style of "Class Feeling Weighs a Thousand Pounds" has moved many people. Some are not only moved but also connect it to their own thinking and learn from Comrades Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan through practical actions. Naturally, in real life, similar events are not numerous. However, dealing with other personal issues in accordance with the spirit of Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan will also eliminate barriers and strengthen unity. Fangcun Brigade is a vivid example.
    The work team of Fangcun Brigade in Luancheng County, Hebei Province, in order to resolve some disputes among the peasants, organized cadres and the masses to study the "People's Daily" report of December 13, 1965, "Class Feeling Weighs a Thousand Pounds," and the article "A Class in the Heart." It aroused strong reactions among the peasants. Young men and women, elderly people in their seventies and eighties, and Young Pioneers wearing red scarves were all moved by the lofty class feelings of Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan and inspired by their great minds. "Learning from the Zhangs" to deal with trivial disputes between commune members and between neighboring teams, to do good deeds, and to do good things has become a conscious action of the broad masses of commune members.
    "We Judged Wrong!"
    Before reading the report "Class Feeling Weighs a Thousand Pounds," the comrades of the work team introduced that there was such a thing, two boys in their teens were playing in the water together, and one child accidentally pushed the other child into the water and drowned him. If this happened in our team, happened to us, how should we treat it? Everyone discussed it a lot. Some said: "Whose child is not dear to them!" "Not to mention a major event like human life, even ordinary quarrels over two children, for a small chicken, duck, dog, or cat, would be awkward, and some wouldn't speak for several years!" Zhai Qun, a member of the Third Production Team, said: "If someone pushed my boy into the water and drowned him, I would have to fight him with a knife, desperately!" The handling methods proposed by everyone can be summarized into four types: Most people advocated that the parents of the child who pushed the other into the water should bear all the funeral expenses for the deceased; some people advocated that the child who pushed the other into the water should be adopted by the deceased's parents to provide for them in their old age; they said: "The 'Biography of Heroic Women' in old operas judged the case wrong and did it this way." Some people also advocated that the child who pushed the other into the water should carry the banner and smash the tiles for the dead child, and accompany the spirit in mourning; and a few individuals advocated sending the child who pushed the other into the water to the court and demanding his life.
      At this time, the comrades of the work team took out the "People's Daily" and said: "Let's take a look at how the workers Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan thought about and treated this major event concerning human life after their son was pushed into the water and drowned by another family's son!" Then they read the newspaper.
      The meeting place gradually became quiet. As they read, some of the listeners wiped their tears, and some cried uncontrollably. After the article was read, the listeners' faces were stained with tears, and they expressed infinite admiration for Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan with a solemn expression. Initially, those who were worried about the fate of the Mei family's child, who had pushed the other into the water, breathed a sigh of relief at this point.
      "We judged this manslaughter wrong!" At the meeting, people retracted their "judgments" one by one. Zhai Qun said: "I didn't expect the Zhangs to think like that and treat this major event like that!" Old commune member Wang Miaocheng said: "We must learn from Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan!" Everyone discussed it: "It's a new society, but we still have old ideas!" "Class is the most important thing!"
    Profound Education
    People were inspired by the moving report "Class Feeling Weighs a Thousand Pounds" and received a profound class education. Wang Linzhu, a member of the Third Production Team, was the first to examine the issue of taking cottonseed cakes when he went to the Shijiazhuang Grease Chemical Factory to deliver cottonseeds; Zhai Zhenshan and Wang Lianrui also examined the issue of taking the electric saw frame from the Twenty-seventh Production Team of the village..., what should they do? Everyone said in unison: "Poor and lower-middle peasants are one family in the world, and we cannot destroy unity for this kind of thing, send the things back and apologize to them!" Early the next morning, Wang Linzhu and others rode their bicycles and went to the Shijiazhuang Grease Chemical Factory with 11 yuan in cash (because there were no more cottonseed cakes); Zhai Zhenshan and several other commune members went to the Twenty-seventh Team to discuss how to compensate for the electric saw frame (because the original was damaged). Before this, the Twenty-seventh Team had discovered that the electric saw frame was taken by the Third Team. Before Zhai Zhenshan and others from the Third Team went to the Twenty-seventh Team this time, they were worried that things would be difficult. Unexpectedly, after they went, the members of the Twenty-seventh Team were very enthusiastic and said: "It's easy to handle, feelings are strengthened by feelings, you take a little money, it's a token of your feelings, and in the future, we must strengthen our unity."
    The members of the Twenty-seventh Team have also been uneasy these past few days. They have also been thinking about a problem in their minds: In 1962, in order to build the machine well house for the production team, they sawed down more than a dozen large trees from the Loudi and Xuying Brigades, what should they do about this? After Wang Rongzhen, the leader of the Poor Peasants' Association, raised it at the commune member meeting, everyone said:
  "According to the Third Team's approach, prepare the wood, catch up with the cart, send it to them, and apologize."
    The "returning things to their owners" incident also happened in the Thirteenth Team. In the autumn of 1964, under the direction of Zhang Yugui, the production team leader, commune members Zhang Hongbin, Zhang Quntang, etc., took some seed cotton from the threshing ground of the West Jingbi Brigade. Now, Zhang Yugui, Zhang Hongbin, and others are taking cash to compensate and apologize. After meeting, the cadres of the West Jingbi Brigade were very enthusiastic, served tea and water, and also held a commune member meeting to welcome them. The cadres of the West Jingbi Brigade also called on the commune members to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the commune members of the Fangcun Thirteenth Team. Zhang Yugui and others apologized to the commune members of West Jingbi, left the money, and were about to leave. The commune members of West Jingbi stopped them again, kept them for dinner; and stuffed the money into their pockets, saying: "Money is a small matter, our class unity is a major matter. Your initiative to admit your mistake is more important to our education than this money!" One side insisted on compensation; the other side resolutely refused, and as a result of mutual pushing, the West Jingbi Brigade still did not accept the money. The warm scene of class friendship was extremely moving!
    These examples of "taking" to "sending" are not ordinary changes, but revolutionary changes! Wang Guicheng, an old poor peasant from the Thirteenth Team, said excitedly: "I have lived for almost seventy years, and I have never seen such a thing. Since the socialist education movement, the atmosphere has really changed greatly!"
    From Estrangement to Unity
    Since the socialist education movement, the revolutionary spark brewing in the hearts of the peasants has been ignited by the moving story of "Class Feeling Weighs a Thousand Pounds!" Zhang Dong, a poor peasant female commune member of the Twenty-second Team, said, wiping her tears: "Cheng Chunlan has a class in her heart, stands high, and sees far. I was also a child bride at the age of ten, but I am far behind her!" She took the initiative to find Zhang Yuchu's mother to reconcile. Originally, because Zhang Yuchu's mother had many children and little labor and had difficulty in life, she needed the team to take care of her; Zhang Dong's family had a lot of labor and a good life, and she was afraid that the team would take care of many difficult households and deduct more public welfare funds, which would affect her less dividends. She had expressed disagreement with taking care of the Yuchu family at the commune member meeting. From this, the two families became resentful and did not speak for more than a year. Now, Zhang Dong went to Yuchu's mother and confessed: "We are all poor and lower-middle peasants, I shouldn't forget my class sisters!" Yuchu's mother also apologized quickly, "I shouldn't have remembered your hatred, and I shouldn't have just relied on the team to take care of me!" Zhang Ruiqing's son and Zhang Bingyin's son fought, and Zhang Ruiqing's son suffered a loss. Zhang Ruiqing insisted that Zhang Bingyin's family take one yuan and two jiao for maintenance expenses, and since then, the two families have been constantly quarreling and have not spoken for several years. After studying "Class Feeling Weighs a Thousand Pounds," Zhang Ruiqing's wife thought: "Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan's son was pushed into the water and drowned by the Mei family's son, but the Zhangs not only did not quarrel with the Mei family, but restrained their grief to comfort the Mei family, and declined the Mei family's offer to bear the funeral expenses. That's how they treated this major event concerning human life. But what about us? The child was not hurt at all, but we insisted on asking them for money, which is too unreasonable." After discussing it with her husband, she took one yuan and two jiao to return it to Zhang Bingyin's family. Zhang Bingyin's family refused to accept the money and said with emotion: "The money is spent, so let it be spent, our unity of poor and lower-middle peasants is important, and in the future, we should no longer hurt feelings for the sake of the children." The commune members who did not speak to each other in this production team have now reconciled. Because the commune members of the Twenty-second Team were originally not united and could not exert their strength, compared with the Twenty-third Team, the quality and quantity of the land were similar, but the annual grain harvest was 14,000 jin less than the Twenty-third Team. After the commune members checked this way, they realized the harm of disunity and the importance of class unity.
    The Sixteenth Production Team was originally very united, but later, because the former production team leader Zhang Zaozi was unfair in his handling of affairs, it caused dissatisfaction among some commune members, and other commune members who were related to Zhang Zaozi by clan or family protected Zhang Zaozi's mistakes. As a result, the commune members of this team were not united, and they could not discuss production together, which affected production. Now, everyone understands the principle of class unity being important and class interests being important, and they have made self-criticisms and united on a new basis.
    The commune members of the Fangcun Brigade used to say, "How is your east side?" or "How is our west side?" Now no one says that anymore.
    The relations between people and between teams, and many trivial family matters, have been properly handled and resolved, and a new situation of united production and united opposition to the enemy has emerged in the entire brigade.

    革命风尚处处传
    谢丁
    编者按：《阶级感情千斤重》的高尚风格，使许多人受到感动。有些人不仅限于感动，而且联系自己的思想，用实际行动向张永安、程春兰同志学习。自然，在现实生活中，类似的事情毕竟是不多的。可是，依照张永安、程春兰的精神处理个人之间的其他问题，同样会消除隔阂，加强团结，方村大队就是一个生动的例证。
    河北省栾城县方村大队工作队，为解决农民群众彼此之间的一些纠纷，在一九六五年十二月二十日前后，组织干部群众学习了《人民日报》十二月十三日登载的《阶级感情千斤重》的报道和《胸中装着一个阶级》的文章，在农民群众中激起了强烈的反响。青壮年男女，七八十岁的老人，戴红领巾的少年儿童，人人为张永安、程春兰夫妇崇高的阶级感情所感动，为他们伟大的胸怀所激励。“学习张家夫妇”，处理社员之间、邻队之间的一些琐事纠纷，做好人，办好事，已成为广大社员的自觉行动。
    “咱断错了！”
    在读《阶级感情千斤重》这篇报道以前，工作队的同志介绍说，有这么一件事，两个十多岁的男孩子一块儿玩水，一个孩子失手把另一个孩子推进水里淹死了。这件事，如果发生在咱们队里，发生在咱们自己头上，该怎么对待呢？大家议论纷纭。有的说：“谁家的孩子谁不亲呀！”“甭说是人命关天的大事了，就是平常为两个孩子吵架，为一个小鸡小鸭、狗呀猫呀的，也弄得别别扭扭，有的几年还不说话哩！”第三生产队一个叫翟群的社员说：“要是有人把我的男孩子推到水里淹死了，我得跟他动刀子，拼命！”大家提出的处理办法，归纳起来有四种：多数人主张由推人下水的孩子的父母给死者承担全部安葬费用；有一部分人主张，叫推人下水的孩子过继给死者的父母，养老送终；他、们说：“旧戏里的《烈女传》，断错了官司，就是这么办的。”也有人主张，叫推人下水的孩子给死了的孩子打幡摔瓦，陪灵戴孝；还有个别人主张，把推人下水的孩子送法院，要他偿命。
      这时候，工作队的同志拿出了《人民日报》说：“咱们看一看工人张永安、程春兰，他们的儿子被别人家的儿子推下水淹死以后，他们是怎样想的，又是怎样对待这件人命关天的大事的吧！”接着就读报纸。
      会场上渐渐肃静下来了。读着读着，听众中间有的人擦眼抹泪了，有的人情不自禁地哭了。文章读完了，听众们的脸上挂着泪痕，带着一派庄严肃穆的表情，对张永安、程春兰夫妇，表示了无限的景仰。开始，替推人下水的梅家孩子捏着一把冷汗的人，到此也松了一口气。
      “这个人命案，咱断错了！”会场上，人们一个一个地收回了自己的“判决”。翟群说：“我可没有估计到张家夫妇这样想，又是这样对待这件大事呀！”老社员王庙成说：“咱可得好好向人家张永安、程春兰学习哩！”大家议论纷纷：“新社会了，咱还是旧思想呀！”“天底下就是阶级亲呀！”
    深刻的教育
    人们从《阶级感情千斤重》这个感人的报道里，得到了启示，受到了深刻的阶级教育。第三生产队社员王林柱，头一个检查了自己去石家庄油脂化工厂送棉籽时，拿了棉仁饼的问题；翟振山、王连瑞也检查了拿本村二十七生产队的电锯架的问题……，怎么办呢？大家异口同声：“天下贫农是一家，不能为这种事破坏团结，把拿的东西送回去，向人家赔情道歉！”第二天一大早，王林柱等人骑上自行车，带着十一元的现款（因为已经没有了棉仁饼），去了石家庄油脂化工厂；翟振山等几个社员找到二十七队，商量如何赔偿电锯架的问题（因原物已损坏）。在这以前，二十七队就发觉电锯架是三队的人拿了。这次三队的翟振山等去二十七队以前，担心事情难办。不料去了以后，二十七队的社员们挺热情，说：“好办，情打情上来，你们拿一点钱，是点心意就算了，以后要搞好咱们的团结。”
    二十七队的社员们，这几天来心里也不平静。他们脑子里也在想着一个问题：一九六二年他们为了盖生产队上的机井房，从楼底、许营两个大队，锯过十几棵大树，这个问题怎么办呢？贫协组长王荣珍在社员会上提出来以后，大家说：
  “照三队的做法，备好木料，赶上大车，给人家送去，还要赔情道歉。”
    “物归原主”的事，在十三队也发生了。第十三生产队一九六四年秋，在生产队长张玉贵指使下，由社员张洪斌、张群堂等，从西荆壁大队的场里，拿过一些籽棉，现在又由张玉贵、张洪斌等人，带着现款去赔偿、道歉。见面后，西荆壁大队的干部十分热情，茶水招待，还召开社员大会欢迎他们。西荆壁大队的干部还号召社员们学习方村十三队的社员们的革命精神。张玉贵等人向西荆壁的社员们赔了情、道了歉，留下款要走。西荆壁的社员们又把他们拦住，留他们吃饭；并且把钱塞到他们口袋里，说：“钱是小事，咱们的阶级团结是大事。你们主动来认错，对俺们的教育比这些钱还重！”一头坚决要赔偿；一头坚决谢绝，互相推让的结果，西荆壁大队到底还是没有收钱。阶级情谊的热烈场面，感人极深！
    这些由“拿”到“送”的事例，不是一个普普通通的转变，而是一个革命的转变！第十三队老贫农王贵成兴奋地说：“我活了快七十的人了，从来可没见过这样的事。社会主义教育运动以来，真是风气大变了！”
    从隔阂到团结
    从社会主义教育运动以来，农民心里酝酿着的革命火种，被《阶级感情千斤重》这个感人的故事点燃了！第二十二队贫农女社员张冬，擦着眼泪说：“人家程春兰胸中装着一个阶级，站得高，看得远。我也是十几岁上当童养媳，可跟人家差得远了！”她主动地找张玉楚的娘去和解。原来因为张玉楚的娘孩子多劳力少，生活困难，需要队上照顾；张冬家劳力多，生活好，怕队上照顾困难户多，扣的公益金多，影响自己少分红，曾经在社员会上发表过不同意照顾玉楚家的意见。从这，两家结下怨，一年多不说话了。现在张冬找到玉楚的娘跟前检讨说：“咱们都是贫农下中农，我不该忘掉阶级姊妹！”玉楚的娘也忙赔不是，“俺不该记你的恨，也不该光依靠队上照顾！”社员张瑞清的儿子和张丙银的儿子打了架，张瑞清的儿子吃了亏，张瑞清硬叫张丙银家拿了一元二角钱的保养费，从此两家不断吵闹，几年不说话了。学习了《阶级感情千斤重》以后，张瑞清的媳妇想：“张永安、程春兰的儿子被梅家的儿子推到水里淹死了，张家不但没和梅家吵闹，反而抑制住自己的悲痛去劝慰梅家，而且谢绝梅家承担安葬费用，他们这样对待这件人命大事。可咱呢？孩子也没伤着什么，硬叫人家拿钱，这太不象话了。”她和男人商量以后，拿着一元二角钱去退还张丙银家。张丙银家不肯收钱，也感动地说：“钱花了就算花了，咱们贫农下中农的团结要紧，今后咱们不要再为孩子们伤感情就是了。”这个生产队原来相互不说话的社员，现在都和好了。二十二队由于社员原来不团结，劲使不齐，同二十三队比，土地的质量、数量本是相差不多的，可是全年的粮食就比二十三队少收一万四千斤。社员们这样一检查，更加认识到不团结的危害，更加认识到阶级团结的重要。
    第十六生产队，本来很团结，后因前任生产队长张皂子处事不公，引起了一部分社员不满，另一部分与张皂子同族和有亲属关系的社员则袒护张皂子的错误，结果这个队的社员闹不团结，生产上也商量不到一起，使生产受到影响。现在，大家懂得了阶级团结为重、阶级利益为重的道理，作了自我批评，在新的基础上团结起来了。
    方村大队的社员们，过去说起话来，不是“你们东头”如何，就是“我们西头”如何，现在没有人这样说了。
    人与人、队与队之间的关系，许多家长理短的问题，得到了正确处理和解决，全大队出现了一个团结生产、团结对敌的新局面。
