    Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from Melbourne: The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) newspaper "Vanguard" recently published an article entitled "The Publication of the English Edition of Mao Zedong's Selected Works is a Historically Significant Event," stating: "On every issue, Mao Zedong has elucidated and developed Marxism-Leninism. In the contemporary era, the scientific wisdom of the working class is concentrated in him. He deservedly stands alongside Marx, Engels, and Lenin." The article said, "The publication of the four-volume English edition of Mao Zedong's Selected Works is a historically significant event."
    At every critical juncture in history, great figures emerge to lead the people forward. In the history of the development of capitalism, Marx and Engels appeared. They first put forward the scientific principles of communism. The emergence of Marxist theory as a weapon of the working class was historically determined. All of Marx and Engels' works are still widely circulated today. After the death of Marx and Engels, Lenin, the immortal Russian revolutionary genius, stepped forward to continue the work of Marx and Engels. Lenin defended and developed all the basic principles of Marxism. Lenin was entrusted by history to develop Marxism. Leninism is the Marxism of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution.
    The article said: Stalin defended Lenin's doctrine and refuted those who opposed it.
    The article stated: "The great Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong is the true successor to these men. He stood out at a critical moment in history. Armed with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong analyzed the situation in China, the world's most populous country located in the heart of Asia. Through tireless and long-term struggle and practice, and in the struggle against many enemies, his thought established its dominant position. His contribution to the concept of establishing a proletarian revolutionary party is extremely significant. This is a development of Marxism-Leninism. His works 'On Practice' and 'On Contradiction' are themselves great works on Marxist-Leninist philosophy."
    The article pointed out: "Marx said: 'The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.'
      "Mao Zedong understood this better than anyone else. Under his encouragement and leadership, philosophy is being used in daily practice among all Chinese workers and peasants, using it to solve all problems of life and society. Mao Zedong taught that Marxist philosophy serves the masses of the people.
      "Mao Zedong's elucidation of the fact and problems of the existence of contradictions in socialism is also a new contribution to Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong struggled against the erroneous view that there are no more contradictions in socialism and pointed out the universality of contradictions. This is also of great significance in consolidating socialism. To struggle to carry through the victory of socialism to the end is a unique contribution of Mao Zedong.
      "Soviet revisionists have betrayed socialism. They deny that contradictions exist in Soviet society. As a result, instead of controlling these contradictions, they have allowed the people to be controlled by them. Soviet society is degenerating towards capitalism.
      "In analyzing the long-term nature of the revolution, Mao Zedong pointed out that there is no shortcut to realizing the revolution. Long-term struggles must be carried out on all fronts. There are many difficulties and setbacks, but overcoming them will guarantee complete victory."
      "On every issue, Mao Zedong has elucidated and developed Marxism-Leninism. In the contemporary era, the scientific wisdom of the working class is concentrated in him. He deservedly stands alongside Marx, Engels, and Lenin."
    The article concluded by emphasizing the importance of studying Chairman Mao's works, saying: "The publication of his main works in popular form will be of inestimable significance in Australia. These works need to be studied and thought about, re-studied and re-thought about. The principles in the works need practice—thinking—re-practice. They need to be studied by the masses of the people, and applied by the masses of the people." These works "provide weapons that greatly help to understand and solve the revolutionary problems of Australia."

    澳《先锋报》盛赞毛泽东选集英文版出版具有历史意义
    毛泽东对发展马列主义作出了巨大贡献
    新华社五日讯　墨尔本消息：澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》最近发表题为《毛泽东选集的出版是具有历史意义的大事》的文章说：“无论在什么问题上，毛泽东都阐明并发展了马克思列宁主义。在当代，在他身上集中了工人阶级的科学的智慧。他同马克思、恩格斯和列宁并列在一起而当之无愧。”文章说，“四卷本的毛泽东选集英文版的出版是一件具有历史意义的大事。”
    在历史的每一个紧要关头，都有伟大的人物出现来领导人民前进。在资本主义的发展历史中，出现了马克思和恩格斯。他们第一次提出了共产主义的科学原理。马克思主义理论作为工人阶级的武器而产生是历史所决定的。马克思和恩格斯的一切著作今天仍然广为流传。在马克思和恩格斯逝世后，不朽的俄国革命天才列宁挺身而出，继续马克思和恩格斯的工作。列宁保卫并发展了马克思主义的所有的基本原理。列宁是受历史的委托来发展马克思主义的人。列宁主义是帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义。
    文章说：斯大林保卫了列宁的学说，驳斥了反对这种学说的人。
    文章说：“伟大的中国革命家毛泽东是这些人的真正的继承人。他在历史的紧要关头站了出来。用马克思列宁主义全副武装起来的毛泽东分析了位于亚洲心脏的、世界上人口最多的国家——中国的形势。在孜孜不倦的长期的斗争和实践中以及在同许多敌人的斗争中，确立了他的思想的支配地位。他对建立无产阶级革命政党的概念所做的贡献是极其巨大的。这是对马克思列宁主义的一个发展。他的著作《实践论》和《矛盾论》本身就是关于马克思列宁主义哲学的伟大著作。”
    文章指出：“马克思说：‘哲学家们只是用不同的方式解释世界，问题在于改变世界。’
      “毛泽东比其他任何人都更好地理解了这一点。在他的鼓励和领导之下，在全体中国工人和农民中间正在把哲学用于日常实践，利用它来解决一切生活和社会问题。毛泽东教导说，马克思主义哲学是为人民大众服务的。
      “毛泽东对社会主义中存在矛盾的事实和问题的阐释也是对马克思列宁主义做出了一个新的贡献。毛泽东同认为社会主义不再存在矛盾的错误观点进行了斗争，并指出了矛盾的普遍性。这一点在巩固社会主义方面也具有非常重大的意义。为把社会主义的胜利贯彻到底而斗争，是毛泽东的一个独到的贡献。
      “苏联修正主义者背弃了社会主义。他们否认苏联社会中存在着矛盾。其结果是他们不但没有去控制这些矛盾，反而让人民被这些矛盾所控制。苏联的社会正在向资本主义蜕化。
      “在分析革命的长期性时，毛泽东指出，要实现革命，没有什么捷径可走。必须在各个战线进行长期斗争。存在着许多困难和挫折，但是战胜它们就可以保证取得一切胜利。”
      “无论在什么问题上，毛泽东都阐明并发展了马克思列宁主义。在当代，在他身上集中了工人阶级的科学的智慧。他同马克思、恩格斯和列宁并列在一起而当之无愧。”
    文章最后强调学习毛主席著作的重要性，它说：“用普及本形式出版他的主要著作，在澳大利亚将有无可估量的意义。这些著作需要学习和思考、再学习和再思考。著作中的原理需要实践——思考——再实践。它们需要人民大众来研究，人民大众来运用。”这些著作“提供了大大有助于了解和解决澳大利亚革命问题的武器。”
