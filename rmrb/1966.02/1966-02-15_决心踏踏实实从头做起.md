    Determined to Start Anew From the Ground Up
    I am of similar age and background as Comrade Jiao Yulu, but my mental state is not as good as his. Guannan has a lot of saline-alkali wasteland and has suffered from severe natural disasters for several consecutive years. As soon as I arrived in Guannan, I mistakenly thought I was taking over a "bad situation." Unlike Comrade Jiao Yulu, I did not see hope in difficulties or advantages in unfavorable conditions, and I did not make up my mind to forge a new path. As a result, I relied too much on higher authorities and bestowed too much favor on subordinates. Compared to Comrade Jiao Yulu, I feel that I have not fulfilled my responsibilities and am very distressed. In the future, I am determined to take "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," carry a hoe, and take my bedding to stay in grassroots units, starting anew from the ground up in a down-to-earth manner.
            Zhang Yixiang, Secretary of the Guannan County Party Committee, Jiangsu

    决心踏踏实实从头做起
    我和焦裕禄同志年龄相仿，出身一样，不同的是我的精神状态不如他。灌南盐碱沙荒地多，又连续几年遇到严重自然灾害。我一到灌南，就错误地认为自己接的是一副“烂摊子”，不象焦裕禄同志那样，从困难中看到希望，从不利条件中看到有利条件，下定决心要杀出一条路来。结果，对上多依赖，对下多恩赐。和焦裕禄同志比，我感到自己没有尽到责任，非常痛心。今后决心带上《毛泽东选集》，扛上锄头，带着被包，到基层去蹲点，踏踏实实地从头做起。
            江苏灌南县委书记　张义祥
