　　Mao Zedong Thought is a Great Motivating Force for China's Construction
　　Japanese Professor Mitsu Furuta Writes About the Mass Upsurge of the Chinese People in Studying Mao Zedong Thought
　　Xinhua News Agency, February 24th, Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Yokohama National University Philosophy Associate Professor Mitsu Furuta published an article in the January special edition of the magazine "Chuo Koron," pointing out that the Chinese people's study of Mao Zedong Thought has become a tremendous force promoting China's socialist construction.
　　Furuta visited China in the autumn of the year before last.
　　Furuta wrote about the Chinese people's living study and application of Chairman Mao's thought: "In our common sense, so-called philosophical thought does not immediately help solve various problems encountered in daily life after it is studied. However, in the common sense of contemporary Chinese people, philosophical thought should be learned through practical problems encountered in daily life, and after learning it, it should be immediately applied to solve practical problems, and it can be done." "The ideological transformation movement unfolded throughout China through the movement of studying Mao Zedong Thought has clearly become a great force promoting China's current socialist construction. Moreover, it is precisely through this movement that the wisdom and morality of the masses themselves are indeed being actively developed. Perhaps it can be affirmed that if this movement had not been unfolded, China after the success of the revolution would not have been able to conquer various difficulties—such as natural disasters, the Soviet Union's cessation of assistance, etc.—and lay the foundation for a China like today."
　　Furuta said that the purpose of China's ideological transformation movement is to produce new people worthy of shouldering the responsibility of building a new society after the success of the revolution through self-transformation. It shows characteristics that only the Chinese revolution possesses. And its prototype comes from Mao Zedong's own method of mastering Marxist thought. "China's ideological transformation movement is the people's self-transformation movement and self-education movement." "Its goal is to transform oneself into a person with the political consciousness of the working class and the spirit of working selflessly for the interests of the whole, and concentrating on the work one is engaged in. In addition, it also seeks the combination of physical labor and mental labor."
　　Furuta said that the characteristic of China's ideological transformation movement lies in the fact that, in principle, it must be carried out voluntarily by each individual under the leadership of the Party. Furuta said that, in my impression, the mood of Chinese intellectuals is serious and cheerful, and also calm and unhurried, "The life consciousness or life feelings of intellectuals have undergone considerable changes in the changes of the entire society."
　　Furuta pointed out when talking about the policy of cadres going down to do labor: "The purpose of the downward movement, fundamentally speaking, is to overcome the division between physical labor and mental labor and cultivate new people, to overcome the differences between cities and rural areas and the separation of intellectuals from workers and peasants and create a new culture. This constructive enthusiasm to open up a path to a future communist society supports this movement." Furuta said that in order to pass on the spirit of the revolution to young people and make them have socialist consciousness, in school education, attention is also paid to the combination of education and productive labor.
　　Furuta said, "I went to China with the purpose of understanding what individual freedom is like (in China) and what individuals think. The facts there made me realize that China never denies individual freedom, but instead seeks a path to unify the two in the serious and tense relationship between individual freedom and the pursuit of collective happiness."
　　Furuta said: "In terms of culture, the new China has not adopted the position of negating traditional culture across the board, but has adopted the position of critically inheriting (traditional culture). The same critical absorption attitude is adopted towards Western culture. That is to say, it wants to build a new socialist culture through this approach. In this way, the people of China today are overflowing with construction enthusiasm in all aspects, heading towards the future."
　　Furuta said: "Every time I personally witnessed this scene in various parts of China, I deeply felt that China is truly undergoing fundamental changes."

　　毛泽东思想是促进中国建设巨大动力
　　日本教授古田光著文谈中国人民学习毛泽东思想的群众性热潮
    新华社二十四日讯　东京消息：日本横滨国立大学哲学副教授古田光在《中央公论》杂志一月特大号上发表文章指出，中国人民学习毛泽东思想已经成为促进中国社会主义建设的巨大力量。
    古田曾经在前年秋季访问过中国。
    古田在谈到中国人民活学活用毛主席思想时写道：“在我们的常识里，所谓哲学思想，不是学习了以后马上有助于解决日常生活中遇到的各种问题的。但是，在当代中国人的常识里，哲学思想是应当通过日常生活中遇到的实际问题来学习，学了以后应当马上运用来解决实际问题，而且是能够这样做的”。“通过学习毛泽东思想的运动而在全中国展开的思想改造运动本身，显然已经成为促进当前中国的社会主义建设的巨大力量。而且，正是通过这个运动，群众本身的智慧和道德，确实在得到积极的发展。也许可以肯定地说，假如不展开这个运动，革命成功以后的中国就不可能征服种种困难——譬如象自然灾害，苏联停止援助等等——而奠造出一个今天这样的中国。”
    古田说，中国的思想改造运动的目的，是要通过自我改造产生出配得上担负建设革命成功以后的新社会的责任的新人。它显示了只有中国革命才具备的特点。而它的原型出于毛泽东本人掌握马克思主义思想的方法。“中国的思想改造运动，是人民的自我改造运动、自我教育运动”。“它的目标是，把自己改造成为具有工人阶级的政治觉悟和为了全体的利益而奋不顾身地工作的精神，专心致志于自己所从事的工作的人。此外还谋求体力劳动和脑力劳动的结合。”
    古田说，中国的思想改造运动的特点，就在于原则上必须是根据每个人的自愿，在党的领导下来进行的。古田说，就我得到的印象来说，中国知识分子的心情是严肃而开朗的，也是从容不迫的，“知识分子的生活意识或者说是生活感情在整个社会的变化中发生了相当大的变化”。
    古田在谈到干部下放劳动的政策时指出：“下放运动的目的，从根本上说，是要克服体力劳动和脑力劳动的分裂现象而培养新人，是要克服城市和农村的差别以及知识分子和工农的分离现象而创造新文化。要开辟出一条通向未来的共产主义社会的大道这种建设性的热情，支持着这个运动。”古田说，为了把革命的精神传给青少年，使他们具有社会主义觉悟，在学校教育中也重视教育和生产劳动相结合。
    古田说，“我是怀着了解（在中国）个人自由怎么样、个人是怎么想的目的去中国的。那里的事实使我认识到，中国决不否定个人自由，反而是寻求一条道路，以便在个人自由在同追求集体幸福的严肃紧张的关系中使两者统一起来”。
    古田说：“在文化方面，新中国也没有采取把传统文化一概否定的立场，而采取了批判地继承
  （传统文化）的立场。对于西方文化，同样也采取了批判性地吸收的态度。就是说，它要通过这种做法来建设新的社会主义文化。这样，如今中国的人民在各个方面都洋溢着建设的热情，走向未来”。
    古田说：“每当我在中国各地亲眼目睹这种光景的时候，每次都深深地感到：中国真正是在发生根本的变化”。
