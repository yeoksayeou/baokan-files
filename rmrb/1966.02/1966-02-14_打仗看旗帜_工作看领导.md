    Look at the Flag in Battle, Look at the Leader in Work
    Zhao Xingmin, Party Secretary and Factory Director of Liaoyuan Power Plant

    The key to the revolutionization of an enterprise lies first in the revolutionization of its leadership. With revolutionary leadership, we can bring forth a revolutionary team and build a revolutionary enterprise. The workers put it well: "Look at the flag in battle, look at the leader in work!" Whatever the mental state of the leadership, the staff and workers will have the same mental state; soldiers follow their general. Therefore, whether the leadership can take the lead, set an example, is extremely important to bringing out what kind of team. In April 1962, our factory was repairing the water source. At that time, the weather in Northeast China was still very cold. After arriving at the construction site, I was the first to take off my clothes and go into the water, and then everyone followed, quickly completing the task.

    Good words and deeds of the leadership have a good influence on the masses, and the shortcomings and faults of the leadership have a bad influence on the masses. My democratic style was not good enough. I usually criticized others too much, did too little investigation and research, and the masses had opinions. This style was also learned by some middle-level cadres and team leaders. At the year-end general evaluation, a worker criticized the team leader of his team, saying, "Factory Director Zhao's shortcomings have all been learned by you; you don't trust others and you criticize others indiscriminately." This incident educated me greatly, making me acutely aware that the words and deeds of a leader are not only a personal matter, but also a matter of bringing out what kind of team.

    The responsibility of enterprise leadership also lies in educating the masses and arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. But those who educate others must first be educated themselves. If the ideological consciousness of leading cadres is not high, they cannot raise the level of ideological consciousness of the masses. Only by constantly carrying out self-transformation can we better help others carry out transformation. In early 1964, after our factory was rated as a "Five-Good Enterprise," some staff, workers and leading cadres developed complacency and arrogance. The Party Committee recognized that difficulties are a test, and so is honor, and it is an even more complex test. So we studied Chairman Mao's discourses on correctly treating achievements. The Party Committee became clear-headed, regarding the achievements already made as the starting point for continued progress. On the one hand, we launched a discussion among the staff and workers on how to correctly treat honor. On the other hand, we organized the staff and workers to go to other places to find shortcomings and learn from experience. The staff and workers' understanding was enhanced, and their enthusiasm was even greater. As a result, a new upsurge of comparing with, learning from, catching up with, helping, and surpassing each other quickly swept through the entire factory.

    打仗看旗帜　工作看领导
    辽源发电厂党委书记兼厂长　赵醒民
    企业革命化的关键，首先在于领导革命化。有了革命化的领导，才能带出革命化的队伍，建设起革命化的企业。工人说得好：“打仗看旗帜，工作看领导！”领导有什么样的精神状态，职工就会有什么样的精神状态，兵随将转。因此，领导能否率先示范，以身作则，对带出个什么样的队伍极为重要。一九六二年四月间，我厂修水源地，当时东北天气还很冷，到工地后，我第一个脱衣下水，接着大家都跟下去了，很快完成了任务。
    领导上好的言行对群众有好影响，领导上的缺点毛病对群众又有坏影响。我的民主作风不够好，平时批评别人多，调查研究差，群众有意见。这种作风，也被一些中层干部和班组长学去了。在年末总评的时候，有一个工人批评本班班长说：“赵厂长的缺点，都叫你学来了，不相信别人，乱批评别人”，这件事对我教育很大，使我痛切感到：一个领导者的言行，不仅是个人的问题，而是关系到带出一支什么样队伍的问题。
    企业领导的责任还在于教育群众，用毛泽东思想武装群众。但教育别人的人必须先受教育，领导干部思想觉悟不高，就不能提高群众的思想觉悟水平。只有不断进行自我改造，才能更好地帮助别人进行改造。一九六四年初，我厂被评为“五好企业”之后，一部分职工和领导干部产生了骄傲自满情绪。党委认识到，困难是考验，荣誉也是考验，而且是更复杂的考验。于是我们学习了毛主席有关正确对待成绩的论述。党委头脑清醒起来，把已取得的成绩，看成是继续前进的起点。我们一方面在职工中开展怎样正确对待荣誉的讨论，一方面组织职工去外地找差距，学经验，职工认识提高了，干劲更足了。于是全厂迅速掀起了比学赶帮超的新高潮。
