Edition: 6

    On February 17, the Political Department of the Ministry of Culture of the CPC held a symposium on learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, which was attended by more than a dozen literary and art workers from the capital. The meeting was presided over by Comrade Yan Jinsheng, Deputy Minister of Culture and Director of the Political Department, and Comrade Xiao Wangdong, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Ministry of Culture, also attended the meeting.

    Yan Jinsheng: Currently, all units under our Ministry of Culture are studying the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, and some literary and art units have already created literary and artistic works. The main purpose of today's symposium is to ask comrades to talk about their personal experiences and insights from studying Comrade Jiao Yulu.

    Taking Jiao Yulu as a Model
    Becoming a Jiao Yulu-style Cadre on the Literary and Art Front
    Ren Hong (President of the China Children's Art Theater):

    I am engaged in children's drama work, serving 250 million children across the country, which is a great responsibility. In recent years, many heroic figures have emerged in our country, and the appearance of each hero has greatly educated me. Jiao Yulu established the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly. His mind was filled with the people and Mao Zedong Thought.

    Jiao Yulu worked in Lankao for a year and a half, leading 360,000 people. I have been working in the theater for more than ten years, leading 200 people, but the difference in the work we do is so great. Why? Mainly because the "selfish" character and the "I" character still occupy a space in my mind, and the "public" character and the "Party" character occupy less space. Ideologically, there are personal distractions. I always prefer to hear good words and dislike criticism. Nowadays, our literary and art workers often say "one specialty with multiple skills." Some comrades in our theater put it well: "Specialty" means focusing on serving the revolution; "multiple skills" means doing whatever the Party needs us to do.

    Comrade Jiao Yulu is a good model for us to learn from. I will definitely be determined to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way in the future, like Jiao Yulu, always and everywhere with the "Party" character and the "public" character first, resolutely struggle with the "I" character and the "selfish" character, and become a Jiao Yulu-style cadre on the literary and art front.

    Li Huanzhi (Director of the Central National Orchestra):

    The deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu have greatly shaken me. As a revolutionary musician, I have a responsibility to create songs to praise the heroic figures of our era.

    In order to express the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu with musical imagery, I am now rushing to create day and night. In the process of creation, I am both very excited and feel that I have gained a lot. I realize that there is a big gap between myself and Jiao Yulu, and I must learn from him well. On the other hand, because the gap in my own thinking is too big, I cannot express the model Communist Party member - the "noble person" and the "pure person" well. Although I joined the revolution earlier than Comrade Jiao Yulu, compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, I have a big blank in terms of life experience and class feelings. How to revolutionize myself and shorten this gap through study is the most important issue. First of all, in terms of class feelings, if there are no deep and ardent class feelings like Jiao Yulu, good works cannot be written. When I write about the poor and lower-middle peasants' remembrance of Jiao Yulu, what are their feelings? I feel that I cannot quite grasp it. In fact, I am still writing with my own feelings, not the feelings of the real poor and lower-middle peasants.

    I have been engaged in revolutionary literary and art work for more than twenty years. Have I stood on the position of workers, peasants, and soldiers to praise them? I feel that there are still problems. Looking back, how much have we really done for the revolution? Don't be satisfied just because some of your songs are popular with the masses.

    Jiao Yulu has the people in his heart, and he doesn't have himself. And I, on the other hand, have myself in my heart, and sometimes think of the people.

    To learn from Jiao Yulu, it is necessary to master Mao Zedong Thought. Why is it that our study of Mao Zedong's works is always behind the workers and peasants? We have studied for so many years, have a certain cultural level, and it is not that we cannot understand it when we read it. The problem is that we only use what we have learned to apply to others, not to ourselves, and we do not study with class feelings. After being a party member for more than twenty years, I have not mastered Mao Zedong Thought and cannot exert greater combat effectiveness in my work, which is a damage to the class interests of the proletariat.

    I didn't do much work for the revolution in the first half of my life. How should I revolutionize in the second half of my life? I think I should thoroughly revolutionize, and truly, long-term, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly devote myself to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, becoming a literary and art worker who completely and thoroughly serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    Tian Fang (Acting Director of Beijing Film Studio):

    Comrade Jiao Yulu's position, viewpoint, and method are completely armed with Mao Zedong Thought. He only has the people in his mind, not "I". He is always conscientious and diligent in the tasks assigned to him by the Party, and he still does not forget to change the appearance of Lankao before he dies, feeling that he has not completed the tasks assigned to him by the Party.

    Comparing myself, I am greatly shaken. I have been educated by the Party for a not short time, but I am very poor compared with Jiao Yulu. Why can Jiao Yulu do this? It is because there is no "I" in his heart. And for a long time, the word "I" has been too heavy for me. In the past two years, although the word "I" has been restrained, it has not been completely resolved. Why? Because my class position has not been completely resolved.

    Recently, I went to Uxin Banner in Inner Mongolia once. The natural conditions there are very poor, but the herdsmen are full of energy, transforming saline-alkali land, learning to grow crops, and carrying forward the spirit of Dazhai. I was very moved and admired when I watched there, but ideologically and emotionally, I was only in a bystander's attitude. If the position problem is not resolved, the class feelings will not be deep.

    What to do in the future? Only by going deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and studying Mao Zedong's works in struggle and practice, can we thoroughly transform our thinking and completely shift our stand. Comrade Jiao Yulu is a concrete mirror, and I will always learn from him.

    Learning Jiao Yulu's Noble Qualities
    Serving Workers, Peasants and Soldiers Heart and Soul, Not for Fame or Profit
    Yuan Shihai (Deputy Head of the First Troupe of the China Peking Opera Theatre):

    After studying the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, I feel very uneasy and ashamed. He did revolution not for fame, not for profit, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death; when I joined the revolution, it was for fame and profit. These days, I often think: Why is there such a big gap? The main reason is the issue of worldview. I was born in hardship, and I entered the opera school to learn opera since I was a child. In the old society's opera school, it was like being in prison for seven years, and I suffered a lot. It is said that people who have struggled out of such an environment should have feelings for the new society, but that was not the case a few years ago. Because after leaving the school, due to the influence of the old society and the wrong teachings of the senior masters, I also embarked on the road of pursuing fame and fortune. Slowly, I also changed. In life, I pursued the bourgeois lifestyle, and in my career, I pursued the brand of a famous actor.

    After joining the revolution, my old ideas have not been well transformed. It can be said that my "body and head are in different places". My body has arrived in the socialist society, but my head is still full of capitalism. Now, when I think about my pursuit of fame and fortune, I feel very regretful. At that time, the first thing I did when I got up in the morning was to read the newspaper to see if my name was on the newspaper advertisement and what position it was in. In the evening, when I went to the theater to perform, I would go a little earlier and deliberately go to the theater entrance to see where my name was ranked on the playbill; if it was ranked at the back, I would be unhappy, and I might not sing well that night. As a result, it caused a lot of trouble for the revolution and also caused great losses to myself, affecting my progress. Comrade Jiao Yulu has no "I" in everything, and I am inseparable from "I" everywhere. A person who participates in the revolution with the ideological basis of pursuing fame and fortune is bound to take a detour. Therefore, for a long time, my stand has not shifted to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Although I performed modern plays in 1958, I did not persist in it. In the past two years, I have been performing revolutionary modern plays on a large scale. Especially after our Peking Opera actors have studied Mao Zedong Thought, we feel that some problems in our minds have been thought out more clearly. Now I perform modern plays according to what Chairman Mao said. In the performance, it is not only learning the language, actions, and appearance of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but mainly learning their thoughts and feelings.

    In the future, I should work selflessly like Comrade Jiao Yulu, do revolution solidly like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and live a hard and simple life. We actors in our fifties have the responsibility of "carrying on the past and opening up the future". We inherited a set of old things from our predecessors when we were young, and we have suffered a lot from it. We must not use that set of old things to influence young actors. We must set a new example for young people. I want to love Mao Zedong Thought like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and I must study Mao Zedong Thought well like him and thoroughly transform my old ideas.

    Shi Daqian (Director of Beijing Film Studio):

    After studying the deeds of Jiao Yulu, I am both excited and uneasy. What is exciting is that our country has successively emerged with role models such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Jiao Yulu. Although our society has not yet entered communism, communist-style new people - "pure people" and "noble people" as Chairman Mao said - have appeared around us. What is uneasy is that now a serious problem has been raised for us comrades who are engaged in literary and art work, that is, how to learn from heroic figures and how to better reflect heroic figures in literary and artistic creations. If we do not study hard and keep up closely, we will not be able to complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party. I deeply feel that I am behind the situation and far from the requirements of the Party. The main thing is that I have not done enough in the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and in self-transformation. Comrade Jiao Yulu always puts the interests of the people first in everything he does, eliminating all selfish ideas and truly achieving selflessness.

    In recent years, I have also often gone down, but although I have gone down, my heart has not taken root among the working people. Therefore, I am still far away from the vast working people, whether in terms of ideological feelings or lifestyle. I still lack the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly. I have personal distractions in my work, and a small bourgeois kingdom is raging in the depths of my thoughts. My pride and delicacy are more serious. "Pride" means that sometimes my nose is pointing to the sky, and I have not truly placed myself among the people. Therefore, although I have made some films showing advanced figures, I have learned very little advanced ideas. "Delicacy" means being afraid of hardship, unable to bear grievances, and lacking training in hard life, especially being afraid of the hardship of ideological struggle. If these gaps are not eliminated, I cannot be a red propagandist of the Party, and I cannot promote Mao Zedong Thought well. To reflect the heroic figures of our era well in the film, I must transform myself and take root among the people.

    Han Zhongjie (Conductor of the Central Philharmonic Orchestra):

    Jiao Yulu's great deeds have deeply educated me and made me further understand: how should I go in the future.

    I am engaged in symphonic music. Symphonic music comes from abroad. Although we originally thought about letting it serve the Chinese revolution and the workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, because we did not take the right path, the things we made were not welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    Jiao Yulu does his work with class feelings. When he goes to a place, he first goes to understand what the poor and lower-middle peasants want and what difficulties they have, and he considers problems from the interests of the vast poor and lower-middle peasants. I am a band conductor, but I have not investigated what the workers, peasants, and soldiers like and why they cannot accept symphonic music. Jiao Yulu's actions have set an example for me. I want to learn his revolutionary spirit of eliminating natural disasters in Lankao County and contribute to solving the problem of our symphonic music serving the Chinese revolution and the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    Taking Jiao Yulu as a Mirror
    Striving to Study and Apply Mao Zedong Thought in a Living Way, Thoroughly Remold the Worldview
    Jin Ming (Director of the Central Song and Dance Troupe):

    When studying Mao Zedong Thought a few days ago, I often thought about this question: How can I master Mao Zedong Thought? After studying the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, this question has become clearer.

    My own thinking is like the land in Lankao County, with many "saline-alkali lands" that are very large and need to be "turned over" and transformed. Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, the most fundamental gap is the issue of worldview. Jiao Yulu dedicated himself to the people because he has a thorough and complete worldview for the people. I have not established a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people. Jiao Yulu has all the people in his heart, and I have myself in my heart, and it is not easy for other things to squeeze in. I am full of energy for things that suit my taste; there are all kinds of contradictions for things that do not suit me.

    I am engaged in dance creation. If I do not have a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people, it is impossible to establish an artistic view of creating for the revolution and for the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    Jiao Yulu is like a spiritual atomic bomb that has shaken me. I will think of Jiao Yulu in everything I do in the future, clear the "saline-alkali land" in my thinking, and move forward in his footsteps.

    Li Shaochun (Head of the First Troupe of the China Peking Opera Theatre):

    Comrade Shihai is right. The gap between us and Comrade Jiao Yulu is mainly that there is still an "I" in the depths of our minds. I am about the same age and experience as Comrade Shihai. I have been learning opera since I was a child and have been performing opera for more than 30 years, but when all is said and done, performing opera is still for the sake of "I". At that time, what I thought of was being the "star".

    After studying the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, I was greatly educated. Comrade Jiao Yulu can use Mao Zedong Thought everywhere he goes. I have not studied Mao Zedong Thought well. For example, when studying "Serving the People", I recognize all the words on it, but I just don't know how to use it. Comrade Jiao Yulu has brought great strength to me. I have learned one thing from him: how should I use Mao Zedong Thought after I have learned it! I am also a communist party member. Comrade Jiao Yulu dared to let the sun and the moon change to a new sky. He worked hard and lived a simple life, and always thought of his class brothers. But what about me? I don't have his high level of awareness, nor do I have his valuable style.

    Comrade Jiao Yulu's attitude towards illness is also an education for me. My mental state towards illness is not as optimistic as his. My illness is not as serious as his, but I think more about it than he does. In short, the word "I" has not been cleared from my mind. In the future, I must not let it engage in "public-private joint venture" in my mind. I want to learn from Jiao Yulu and be a real communist party member.

    Meng Qingliang (Actor of the China Youth Art Theatre):

    Comrade Jiao Yulu's actions have pointed out to us: how should we be a real communist party member and how should we treat Mao Zedong Thought.

    I have been going down more in the past few years than before. I went to Daqing and was indeed educated. Combining the study of Mao Zedong Thought, my understanding has been improved, but I am still far from ideological revolutionization. Ideological revolution is very difficult. We can say that a specific work task has been completed when the task is completed. However, ideological transformation is not like this. No one can say that their ideological transformation task has been completed. Ideological transformation requires continuous revolution. Here are some examples: In order to make a movie, I went down to be a soldier. At that time, I thought I had done everything that a soldier should do. Soon after, I returned to Shanghai to make a movie and found that my old clothes were really inappropriate, so I quickly made a new set of clothes. Jiao Yulu said, can't we make revolution while sitting on a broken chair? It can be seen that I have not really been a good soldier. When I was in Daqing, Wang Jinxi, who I worked with for over a year, said something like this: The proletariat is a born offensive class. If it doesn't attack, it will stagnate, and revisionism will be produced. At that time, I thought this was a very good statement, and I used it as a heroic statement to talk about it everywhere, but when I encountered many problems, I didn't attack but defended, and sometimes even went backwards. After studying the deeds of Jiao Yulu, it occurred to me that without establishing a worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly, even if people go down, their hearts will not go down.

    Learning Jiao Yulu's Revolutionary Spirit
    Be Good Revolutionary Successors on the Literary and Art Front
    Liu Changyu (Young Actress of the China Peking Opera Theatre):

    Comrade Jiao Yulu is a pure and noble person. Why does he have such great ideas and power? The main reason is the result of living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought.

    I went to the China Opera School at the age of nine. The Party has cultivated me to this day, and I am now able to serve the people. Jiao Yulu said that he is the son of a poor peasant. However, in terms of ideological feelings, I have not yet become a true daughter of a poor peasant like Comrade Jiao Yulu. Last year, when I went to the countryside, it was hot and mosquitoes were biting, so I couldn't stand it anymore. This shows that I am far away from the working people.

    Comrade Jiao Yulu is really like what Lu Xun said, eating grass and squeezing out milk; I eat milk but have not made any contribution to the revolution. In the past, I often considered myself first when something happened. I remember when rehearsing "The Red Lantern," I thought that acting on the same stage with so many famous actors would definitely make me the worst actor, and I had ideological concerns. After the help of the leadership, I realized that I should only learn from Tie Mei and act well as the revolutionary successor, Tie Mei. Later, the leadership assigned me to play a character with shortcomings, and I didn't want to play it because I was afraid that the audience would have a bad impression of me as a result. Later, I thought that this was to set off heroic figures. If I didn't play it and let someone else play it, what kind of style would this be? Why am I thinking about myself again?

    The performance of revolutionary modern Peking Opera has just begun. We, the young actors of this generation, must take on this revolutionary task and let revolutionary modern Peking Opera stand on the stage. In the future, I will be a good student of Chairman Mao like Comrade Jiao Yulu.

    Yang Qiuling (Young Actress of the China Peking Opera Theatre):

    Comrade Jiao Yulu is selfless, egoless, and fearless. He takes Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to action.

    I am a young actor cultivated by the Party, but when I encounter specific problems, the word "I" often pops out. During the Spring Festival performance period, the organization assigned me more than a dozen plays. Due to the climate, I caught a cold and my voice was hoarse. I thought that I had only performed five or six plays. I had to perform, but I was afraid that my voice would be ruined and I would not be able to be an actor. At this time, I studied "Serving the People", overcame the idea of "I" being the leader, and found the correct way to deal with it: rest well at home and take care of my voice, and actively seek medical treatment. In this way, I not only recovered my voice, but also persisted in the performance, satisfying the audience's desire to see the show during the Spring Festival.

    Xiao Wangdong: Comrade Jiao Yulu is a great proletarian fighter, a good student of Chairman Mao, a good servant of the people, and a good example for us. Jiao Yulu is great and ordinary; Jiao Yulu is not easy to learn, but it is easy to learn. If we throw away the word "I", it will be easy to learn. If we still carry the word "I", we will never learn well. The most important thing for us literary and art workers is to study Mao Zedong Thought seriously like Comrade Jiao Yulu, study and apply it in a living way, and demand ourselves seriously and strictly, and work hard on the word "use". If we achieve this, we may become a great and ordinary warrior like Comrade Jiao Yulu. (Attached picture)

### 认真学习焦裕禄　彻底改造世界观——首都文艺工作者学习焦裕禄座谈会

    认真学习焦裕禄　彻底改造世界观
    ——首都文艺工作者学习焦裕禄座谈会
    二月十七日，中共文化部政治部召开了一个向焦裕禄同志学习的座谈会，首都十几位文艺工作者参加了座谈。会议由文化部副部长、政治部主任颜金生同志主持，文化部党委书记萧望东同志也出席了会议。
    颜金生：现在我们文化部所属的各个单位都在学习焦裕禄同志的事迹，有的文艺单位已经创作出了文艺作品。今天的座谈会，主要请同志们谈谈个人学习焦裕禄同志的体会、心得。
    以焦裕禄为榜样
    在文艺战线上做一个焦裕禄式的干部
    任虹（中国儿童艺术剧院院长）：
    我是从事儿童戏剧工作的，为全国二亿五千万少年儿童服务，这个责任很大。这几年，我们的国家涌现出很多英雄人物，每一位英雄的出现，对自己都有很大的教育。焦裕禄树立了完全、彻底地为人民服务的思想，在他的脑子里装满了人民，装满了毛泽东思想。
    焦裕禄在兰考工作一年半，领导三十六万人民。我在剧院工作十多年，领导二百人，而做的工作差距那么大，为什么？主要是因为在我脑子里，“私”字和“我”字还占着地盘，“公”字和“党”字地盘占得还少。思想上有个人杂念，总愿意听好话，不喜欢听批评。现在，我们文艺工作者常说“一专多能”。我们院里有些同志说得好：“专”，就是要专心为革命；“多能”，就是党需要我们干什么就干什么。
    焦裕禄同志是我们学习的好样板，我今后一定下决心活学活用毛泽东思想，象焦裕禄那样，时时处处以“党”字“公”字当头，坚决和“我”字“私”字斗争，在文艺战线上做一个焦裕禄式的干部。
    李焕之（中央民族乐团团长）：
    焦裕禄同志的事迹，对我震动很大。作为一个革命的音乐工作者，我有责任创作歌曲来歌颂我们时代的英雄人物。
    为了用音乐形象把焦裕禄同志的事迹表现出来，现在我正在连夜赶创作，在创作过程中，我一方面很激动，感到有很大收获，想到自己与焦裕禄之间存在很大差距，要很好地向他学习。另一方面，又由于自己思想上的差距太大，不能很好地把模范共产党员——“高尚的人”、“纯粹的人”表现出来。我参加革命虽然比焦裕禄同志早，但与焦裕禄同志比，我在生活经历上、阶级感情上都有很大空白。如何通过学习，使自己革命化，缩短这个差距，这是最主要的问题。首先在阶级感情上，如果没有象焦裕禄那样深厚的、火热的阶级感情，是写不出好作品来的。当我写到贫下中农怀念焦裕禄的时候，他们是什么感情？我感到不大能够捉摸，实际上还是在以我自己的感情在写，而不是真正的贫下中农的感情。
    我搞了二十多年的革命文艺工作，是不是已经立足在工农兵的立场上来歌颂工农兵？我感到还是有问题。回头一看，我们为革命到底做了多少事情？不要以为自己有几首歌曲受到群众欢迎就满足起来。
    焦裕禄心里装着人民，就是没有他自己。而我呢，是心里装着自己，有时候想到人民。
    学习焦裕禄，就要把毛主席思想学到手。为什么我们学习毛主席著作总是落后于工农群众？我们读了那么多年书，有一定文化水平，读了不是看不懂，问题在于我们学了只是用来对人家，而不是对自己，没有带着阶级感情来学。作了二十多年的党员，没有把毛主席思想学到手，不能在工作中发挥更大的战斗力，这就是对无产阶级阶级利益的损害。
    我前半辈子没有为革命做多少工作，后半辈子该怎么革命？我想，应该彻底革命，真正长期地、无条件地、全心全意地投入到工农兵中去，上着天，下着地，成为完全地、彻底地为工农兵服务的文艺工作者。
    田方（北京电影制片厂代理厂长）：
    焦裕禄同志的立场、观点、方法完全是用毛主席思想武装起来的，他脑子中只有人民，没有“我”。对党交给的任务，总是兢兢业业，临死还不忘改变兰考面貌，觉得自己没有完成党交给的任务。
    对比自己，震动很大。自己受党教育时间不短，和焦裕禄相比却很差。焦裕禄为什么能这样，就是因为心里没有“我”。而我长期以来就是“我”字太重。近两年来，虽然“我”字有所收敛，但并没有彻底解决。为什么？因为自己的阶级立场问题还没有完全解决。
    最近，我去内蒙古乌审召一次。那里自然条件很差，牧民干劲十足，改造盐碱地，学种庄稼，发扬了大寨精神。我在那里看，很感动，很钦佩，但思想感情上还只是旁观的态度，立场问题没有解决，阶级感情也就不会深。
    今后怎么做？只有深入工农兵，在斗争中，在实践中学习毛主席著作，彻底改造思想，把立足点完全移过来。焦裕禄同志是一面具体的镜子，我要永远向他学习。
    学习焦裕禄的崇高品质
    不为名，不为利，全心全意为工农兵服务
    袁世海（中国京剧院一团副团长）：
    我学习了焦裕禄同志的事迹以后，心里很不安，很惭愧。他干革命不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死；我参加革命的时候，就是为了名为了利。这些天，我常想：为什么会有这么大的差距呢？主要原因还是世界观的问题。我出身寒苦，自小就入科班学戏，在旧社会的科班里，如同蹲了七年大狱，受了不少罪。按说从那样的环境下挣扎出来的人跟新社会应该有感情哪，可是前几年并不是这样。因为出科以后，由于受了旧社会的熏染，前辈师傅们的错误教导，自己也走上了追求名利的道路。慢慢地自己也就变了，生活上追求资产阶级生活方式，事业上就追求名角的牌子。
    参加革命之后，自己的旧思想没有得到很好改造，可以说是“身首异处”，身子到了社会主义社会，脑袋瓜里还是资本主义的一套。现在想一想自己追求名利的思想觉得很后悔。那时候早晨起来第一件事，就是看报，看看报纸广告上有没有自己的名字，放在什么地位。晚上到剧场去演戏，也早去一会儿，特意到剧场门口看看戏报上自己的名字排在什么地方；如果排的靠后，自己就不痛快，这晚上的戏就兴许唱不好。这样做的结果，给革命带来了不少的麻烦，对自己也有很大的损失，影响了自己的进步。焦裕禄同志处处没有“我”字，我是处处离不开“我”。一个人抱着追求名利的思想基础参加革命，是必然要走弯路的。所以长期以来，我的立足点没转到工农兵方面来。一九五八年虽然演了现代戏，可是就没有坚持下来。近两年大演革命现代戏，特别是我们京剧演员学习了毛主席著作以后，觉得头脑里有些问题想得比较清楚了，我现在演现代戏就按毛主席说的办了。在表演当中，不仅是学工农兵的语言、动作、外表，主要是学他们的思想感情。
    今后应该象焦裕禄同志那样忘我地工作，象焦裕禄同志那样扎扎实实地干革命，艰苦朴素地生活。我们这些五十多岁的演员负有“承上启下”的责任，我们小时候承受了前辈师傅的一套旧东西，我们已经受害不浅了，我们不能再拿那一套旧东西来影响青年演员，我们要给青年树立新的榜样。我要学习焦裕禄同志那样热爱毛主席著作，一定要象他那样好好地学习毛主席著作，彻底改造自己的旧思想。
    史大千（北京电影制片厂导演）：
    学了焦裕禄的事迹以后，一方面是激动，一方面是不安。激动的是我们国家接连出现了雷锋、王杰和焦裕禄这样的榜样，我们的社会虽然还没有进入共产主义，但共产主义式的新人——象毛主席所说的“纯粹的人”，“高尚的人”已经出现在我们身边。不安的是现在对我们这些做文艺工作的同志来说，提出了一个严重的问题，就是如何学习英雄人物，和如何在文艺创作中更好地反映英雄人物的问题。如果我们不好好学习，紧紧跟上去，那就完不成党交给我们的任务。我深深感到自己落后于形势，距离党的要求还很远。主要是在活学活用毛主席著作上，在自我改造上做得很不够。焦裕禄同志处处、事事、时时把人民的利益放在第一位，排除一切私心杂念，真正做到了忘我的程度。
    这几年，我也常下去，可是，虽然下去了，自己的心还没有扎根在劳动人民中间。所以自己无论在思想感情上、生活方式上，距离广大的劳动人民还很远。我还缺乏全意全心为人民服务的思想，做工作有个人杂念，思想深处有一个小资产阶级的王国在那里兴风作浪。我的骄、娇二气比较严重，“骄”就是有时候鼻子朝天，没有真正把自己置身于人民之中。所以虽然拍了些表现先进人物的影片，但是学到的先进思想还很少。“娇”就是怕苦，受不得委屈，对艰苦的生活也缺乏锻炼，尤其是怕思想斗争的苦。这些差距不消灭，就不能做党的红色宣传员，就不能很好宣传毛泽东思想。要很好地在电影中把我们时代的英雄人物反映出来，我必须脱胎换骨地改造自己，扎根于人民之中。
    韩中杰（中央乐团指挥）：
    焦裕禄的伟大事迹深深地教育了我，使我进一步明白了：今后的路子应该怎样走下去。
    我是搞交响乐的。交响乐是从外国来的，原来我们虽然也想到过让它为中国革命服务，为工农兵服务。可是，由于路子没有走对，我们搞的东西，工农兵不欢迎。
    焦裕禄是带着阶级感情做工作的。他到一个地方，就去先了解贫下中农有什么要求和困难，考虑问题都从广大贫下中农利益出发。我是乐队指挥，却没有去调查工农兵喜爱什么，他们为什么不能接受交响乐。焦裕禄的行动，给我树立了榜样，我要学习他消灭兰考县自然灾害的那种革命精神，在解决我们的交响乐为中国革命、为工农兵服务的问题中贡献一分力量。
    以焦裕禄为镜子
    努力活学活用毛主席著作，彻底改造世界观
    金明（中央歌舞团导演）：
    前些日子学习毛主席著作，时常在想这么一个问题：怎么样才能把毛泽东思想学到手？学习了焦裕禄同志的事迹后，这个问题比较明确了。
    自己思想上就象兰考县的土地那样，有很多“盐碱地”，面积很大，需要好好“翻一翻”，改造改造。和焦裕禄同志相比，最根本的一条差距是世界观问题。焦裕禄为人民鞠躬尽瘁，因为他有一个彻底、完全为人民的世界观。自己就没有树立起全心全意为人民的世界观。焦裕禄心里装着的是全体人民，我心里装着的是自己，别的东西是不容易挤进去的。合自己胃口的事情就劲头十足；不合自己的就矛盾百出。
    我是搞舞蹈创作的，如果没有全心全意为人民服务的世界观，就不可能树立为革命、为工农兵而创作的艺术观。
    焦裕禄象一颗精神原子弹一样，震动了自己，以后时时事事要想到焦裕禄，清除自己思想上的“盐碱地”，踏着他的脚印前进。
    李少春（中国京剧院一团团长）：
    世海同志说的很对，我们跟焦裕禄同志有差距，主要是思想深处还有个“我”字。我跟世海同志的年龄、经历相仿，从小学戏，已经演了三十多年的戏了，可是说来说去唱戏还是为了个“我”。那时，想到的就是“挂头牌”。
    学习了焦裕禄同志的事迹以后，受到很大的教育。焦裕禄同志学习毛主席著作处处能用，我学习毛主席著作学得不好，例如学习《为人民服务》，上面的字我全认得，可就是不会用。焦裕禄同志给我带来很大的力量，我从他身上学到一条：学了毛主席著作应该怎么个用法！我也是个共产党员，焦裕禄同志敢于让日月换新天，他工作艰苦，生活朴素，处处想到阶级弟兄，而我呢？我没有他那么高的觉悟，也没具备他那么可贵的作风。
    焦裕禄同志对待疾病的态度对我也是个教育，我对疾病的精神状态就不如他那样乐观。我的病没有他的病重，但是想得却比他多。总之，“我”字在我的头脑里还没有肃清。今后，我决不能让它在我头脑里搞“公私合营”，我要学习焦裕禄那样做一个真正的共产党员。
    孟庆良（中国青年艺术剧院演员）：
    焦裕禄同志的行动，给我们指出了：应该怎样做一个真正的共产党员和怎样对待毛主席著作。
    这几年我下去比以前多了些。我到大庆，确实受到教育，结合学习毛主席著作，认识有所提高，但离思想革命化还差得很远。思想革命是很艰巨的，我们完成一件具体工作任务，可以说这个任务完成了。可是，思想改造就不是这样，谁也不能说，自己的思想改造任务已经完成了。思想改造是要不断地革命。举些例子：为了拍电影，我下去当过兵，当时以为当兵应做的事我都做了。不久，我回到上海去拍电影，发现我身上原有的一身旧衣服，实在不象话，连忙做了一身新衣服。焦裕禄说，难道坐在破椅子上就不能革命吗？可见我并没有真正当好兵。在大庆和王进喜相处一年多，他说过这么句话：无产阶级是天生的进攻阶级，不进攻就要停滞，就会产生修正主义。当时我觉得这话很好，把它当作豪言壮语到处去说，但自己遇到很多问题就不是进攻而是防守，有时甚至是开倒车。学习了焦裕禄的事迹，使我想到，不树立全心全意为人民服务的人生观，人下去了心也还是不会下去的。
    学习焦裕禄的革命精神
    当好文艺战线上的革命接班人
    刘长瑜（中国京剧院青年演员）：
    焦裕禄同志是一个纯粹的人，高尚的人。为什么他身上有这么伟大的思想和力量？主要是活学活用毛主席思想的结果。
    我九岁到中国戏曲学校，党培养我到今天，能够为人民服务了。焦裕禄说他是贫农的儿子，可是，我从思想感情上还没有象焦裕禄同志那样，真正成为贫农的女儿。去年到乡下，天又热，蚊子又咬，我就有点受不了。这说明我和劳动人民有很大距离。
    焦裕禄同志真是象鲁迅说的一样，吃的是草，挤出来的是奶；我吃的是奶，却没为革命作出什么贡献。我过去还常常一事当前，先替自己考虑，记得排《红灯记》时，我想同那么多名演员同台演戏，准是我演得最坏，思想有顾虑。经过领导上的帮助，我才明白，只有向铁梅学习，把革命接班人铁梅演好才对。后来领导上又分配我演一个有缺点的人物，我又不想演，怕因此观众对我印象不好。后来，我想这是为了陪衬英雄人物，如果我不演，让别人演，这是什么风格呢？怎么又想到我自己了呢？
    京剧演革命现代戏还刚开始，我们这一代青年演员要担当起这个革命重任，要让京剧革命现代戏在舞台上立起来，今后我要象焦裕禄同志那样，做毛主席的好学生。
    杨秋玲（中国京剧院青年演员）：
    焦裕禄同志无私，无我，无畏。他把毛主席著作当作行动的指南。
    我是党培养起来的青年演员，可是遇到具体问题，常常“我”字往外冒。春节演出期间，组织上派我十几场戏，因为气候关系，感冒，嗓子哑了。想到才演出五六场，不演不行，可又怕坏了嗓子就当不成演员了。这时候，我就学习《为人民服务》，克服了“我”字当头的思想，找到了正确处理办法：在家时好好休息保养嗓子，积极找医生治疗。这样，既恢复了嗓子，又坚持了演出，满足了观众春节看戏的要求。
    萧望东：焦裕禄同志是伟大的无产阶级战士，是毛主席的好学生，是人民的好勤务员，是我们的好榜样。焦裕禄是伟大的，又是平凡的；焦裕禄是不容易学的，又是容易学的。如果我们抛掉一个“我”字便容易学了。如果还带着个“我”字是永远学不好的。我们文艺工作者，最重要的是要象焦裕禄同志那样认真地学习毛主席著作，活学活用，认真地、严格地要求自己，在用字上狠下功夫。做到这一条，我们就有可能成为一个象焦裕禄同志那样的伟大而平凡的战士。（附图片）
