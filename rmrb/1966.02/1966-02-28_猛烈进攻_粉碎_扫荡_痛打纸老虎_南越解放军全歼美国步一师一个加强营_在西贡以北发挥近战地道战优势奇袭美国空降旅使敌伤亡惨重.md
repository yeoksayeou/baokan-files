    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 27th (Dispatch) -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Thu Dau Mot Province in South Vietnam fiercely attacked the U.S. invading army's 1st Infantry Division and the Australian accomplice troops in Ben Cat town on the 24th, completely annihilating a reinforced battalion of the U.S. invading army and two armored vehicle convoys.

    On the 22nd, a brigade of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division and the Australian accomplice troops launched a large-scale "mopping-up" operation in Nha Do and Phuong Trang, about 11 kilometers northeast of Ben Cat town. The local Liberation Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on the enemy stationed in Nha Do at 1:22 AM on the 24th. According to preliminary reports, after four hours of intense fighting, the Liberation Armed Forces have completely annihilated a reinforced battalion of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division and two armored vehicle convoys equipped with thirty M-113 amphibious armored vehicles, seizing a large quantity of weapons and military supplies.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 27th (Dispatch from Saigon) -- On the 26th, in the "Iron Triangle" area north of Saigon, the South Vietnam Liberation Army fully exploited its advantages in close combat and tunnel warfare, launching a surprise attack on the invading troops of the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. According to Western news agencies, on the 26th, two companies of paratroopers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade ventured into the heavily forested area 32 kilometers north of Saigon, advancing north in two directions. At 3:10 PM, the U.S. troops in the company on the right flank were suddenly attacked by "devastating fire" from Liberation Army forces hidden in nearby tunnels. The Associated Press, in a report on February 27th, quoted an officer as saying, "Recoilless rifle rounds, machine gun bullets, and mortar shells rained down on the column." "The lead company requested air support and tried to retreat, but the Viet Cong accelerated the battle to such a fierce pace that the troops could do nothing but lie on the ground and return fire. Heavy casualties were suffered in this attack."

    The fierce battle lasted for six hours. The company, composed of 200 paratroopers, was almost completely annihilated. The Associated Press reported, "This badly battered company is no longer a combat-effective unit."

    On the morning of the 27th, the enemy gathered some troops to conduct a "search," but the Liberation Army had already victoriously transferred and vanished without a trace.

    It is reported that the troops of the 173rd Airborne Brigade were deployed for this "mopping-up" operation for the first time after more than a month of "rest" and "replenishment," but as soon as they set foot on the liberated area, they were once again battered and bloodied.

　　猛烈进攻　粉碎“扫荡”  痛打纸老虎
　　南越解放军全歼美国步一师一个加强营
　　在西贡以北发挥近战地道战优势奇袭美国空降旅使敌伤亡惨重
    新华社河内二十七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方土龙木省解放武装力量二十四日在边葛镇猛烈袭击美国侵略军第一步兵师和澳大利亚帮凶军，全歼美国侵略军一个加强营和两个装甲车队。
    美国第一步兵师的一个旅和澳大利亚帮凶军，二十二日对边葛镇东北约十一公里的芽多、蓬庄等地发动大规模“扫荡”。当地解放武装力量在二十四日凌晨一时二十二分向驻扎在芽多的敌人发动猛烈进攻。据初步消息，经过四个小时的激烈战斗，解放武装力量已全歼美军第一步兵师一个加强营和拥有三十辆M—113型两栖装甲车的两个装甲车队，缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    据新华社二十七日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放军二十六日在西贡以北“铁三角”地区充分发挥近战和地道战的优势，奇袭美国第一七三空降旅的侵略军，使敌人遭到惨重伤亡。据西方通讯社报道，二十六日，第一七三空降旅的两连伞兵窜入西贡以北三十二公里丛林密布的地区，分成两路向北进犯。下午三点十分，走在右翼的一连美军突然遭到附近隐蔽在地道里的解放军的“毁灭性火力”的袭击。据美联社二十七日在一篇报道中援引一个军官的话说：“无后座力炮弹、机关枪子弹和迫击炮弹象雨点一样落进队伍中来。”“这个先头连要求空军前来支援，并且试图往后撤，但是，越共加快战斗的速度到如此猛烈的程度，以致使军队不能做任何事情，只能匐伏在地上还击。就在这个攻击中遭到了大量伤亡。”
    激烈的战斗进行了六个小时。这个由二百名伞兵组成的连几乎被全部歼灭。美联社报道说：“这个被打得乱七八糟的连已经不成为一支有战斗力的部队了。”
    二十七日早晨，敌人又纠集了一些部队进行“搜索”，但是，解放军早已胜利转移，走得无影无踪了。
    据报道，第一七三空降旅的部队这次是在经过一个多月的“休整”和“补充”后第一次出动“扫荡”，但是，当他们刚刚踏上解放区的土地，就又一次被碰得头破血流。
