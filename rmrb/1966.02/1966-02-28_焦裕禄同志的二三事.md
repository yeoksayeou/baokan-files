　　Two or Three Things About Comrade Jiao Yulu
　　Zhang Shiyi, Head of Zhuaying Commune, Lankao County
    In the winter of 1962, when Comrade Jiao Yulu came to Lankao to serve as the county party secretary, I was working in the Lankao County Party Committee office. I worked with him for more than five months, off and on. His revolutionary spirit of utter devotion to the Party and the people is what I remember most vividly.

    Treating the "Illness" of the Lao Hanling Brigade
    The day after Comrade Jiao Yulu arrived in Lankao, he went deep into the Lao Hanling Brigade of Chengguan Commune. I went with him that time. Lao Hanling Brigade had suffered from continuous natural disasters from 1959 to 1962 and was an old disaster-stricken team. However, this did not scare Comrade Jiao Yulu. He went deep into the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants and made a visit. In the evening, he asked the brigade party secretary to notify nine old poor peasants and experienced old party members who had suffered deeply and were extremely poor to hold a discussion. Through the discussion, he found a way to change the face of Lao Hanling: it was necessary to formulate a reasonable system to protect the natural paulownia seedlings in the fields; it was necessary to plant more economic crops such as peanuts and cotton, and plant fewer grain crops according to the characteristics of the sandy soil (after the paulownia trees grow up and form a forest belt that can prevent wind and fix sand, grain crops should be appropriately increased); it was necessary to formulate a reasonable triangular contract for livestock breeding rewards and penalties, and vigorously breed livestock. The "prescription" for changing the face of Lao Hanling was found. He said to Meng Qingkai, the secretary of the commune party committee: "The poor and lower-middle peasant members see clearly, the problems are raised sharply, and the direction is clear. We must resolutely support them. If we continue to do so, we will be able to change the face of the area quickly." Since then, Comrade Jiao Yulu and I often went to the Lao Hanling Brigade to participate in labor. Now, Comrade Jiao Yulu's prediction has become a reality. The paulownia trees in Lao Hanling Brigade have grown widely, and the windbreak forest belt has begun to play a role in preventing wind and fixing sand. Since the autumn of 1963, the "old disaster team" label of this brigade has been removed, and it has become a surplus grain team.

    Love Every Blade of Grass and Tree in Lankao
    During the Spring Festival of 1963, I followed Comrade Jiao Yulu to the Nanzhang Commune to arrange work. Passing through the territory of Xiaosong Commune, Comrade Jiao Yulu looked at the sandy land in the western part of Xiaosong and said: "If we plant trees on these abandoned dikes and sand dunes, in three to five years, this place will become an oasis. At that time, wouldn't the trees become money trees! The land next to these abandoned dikes and sand dunes can also become fertile farmland!" We returned to the county after touring the communes of Hongmiao, Xiaosong, Nanzhang, Zhang Junmu, and Yifeng. One day, Comrade Jiao Yulu said in the county party committee office: "Lankao is extremely good, it is really a good place. In terms of local products, there are wheat, sorghum, soybeans, peanuts, jujubes and apples, 'lilies' and yams, famous Lankao fermented bean curd, and especially 360,000 hardworking people. Lankao has unlimited potential and a bright future. I will not leave if I don’t change the face of Lankao!"

    Comrade Jiao Yulu's words are very educational to us. The large water pits, depressions, abandoned dikes, and sand dunes that are all over Lankao have never been profitable in the past years. Many comrades, including myself, have no confidence in cultivating these lands. However, Comrade Jiao Yulu regarded those lands as "economic income bases," "cornucopias," "money trees," and fertile fields producing grains after three to five years. To be honest, I feel that it is difficult to work in the disaster area in Lankao, and although I have not made any demands verbally, I really hope that the organization will transfer me to another county. After working with Comrade Jiao Yulu for a period of time, his spirit of seeing the light in the face of difficulties encouraged me and filled me with confidence and strength. Now, I am willing to work in Lankao for the rest of my life.

    Do Whatever the Revolution Needs
    Once in the county party committee office, Comrade Jiao Yulu encouraged us to learn to write, write articles for newspapers, and compose modern dramas. At that time, the comrades in the office said: "Our level is not high, and we can't write well." He said: "As a revolutionary, we must fight against difficulties. Do whatever the revolution needs you to do. If you don't know how to do it, you have to learn!" Then he said: "In 1948, when I first arrived in Henan, it was on the eve of the full-scale launch of the land reform movement. At that time, we needed to publicize it, so our work team organized a play. I had never acted before, but I also participated in the performances of 'Blood and Tears of Hatred' and 'The White-Haired Girl'. In 'The White-Haired Girl', I played Yang Bailao." He also said: "Before 1953, I was engaged in rural work. After 1953, the superiors transferred me to the Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory to engage in industry. I really didn’t know anything, but the revolution needed it, so I should delve into it." Since then, when I was with him, I gradually learned to write documents.

    Do Not Forget the Past
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was born into a poor peasant family. He suffered from the oppression and exploitation of landlords since he was a child, and his life was worse than that of cattle and horses. He was also bullied by Japanese imperialism. Once, when he talked about production and disaster relief work at a meeting of cadres in Chengguan Commune, he said: "The sale of surplus grain in bumper harvest areas is a patriotic manifestation of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism. Our disaster areas can also achieve self-reliance through production and reduce the amount of state-allocated grain, which is also a patriotic manifestation of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism." On the way back after the meeting, he said: "When I mention imperialism, I think of the Japanese devils. I almost died in their hands. That year, I was captured by the devils and forced to work as a coolie. I was taken to the Northeast and locked in a basement prison. It was terribly hot in the summer, and they didn't give us water to drink. Later, everyone elected me as a representative to ask the devils for water, but they refused many times. When we asked hard, they sprayed water into the prison with a faucet, turning the prison into a water prison. The water was chest-deep, and the cold water made everyone shiver. Another time, when it was time to eat, I, as a representative, distributed steamed buns to everyone. In the end, there were no more for me. At that time, I was so hungry that I asked the Japanese devils for steamed buns. They refused. A devil in a khaki uniform put a rope around my neck and made me crawl. I refused, so he beat me with a whip. He beat me for several hours, until I was covered in bruises. We must not forget that there is still imperialism in the world!"

　　焦裕禄同志的二三事
　　兰考县爪营公社社长　张士义
    一九六二年冬天，焦裕禄同志来兰考任县委书记的时候，我正在兰考县委办公室工作。前前后后，我跟他在一块工作有五个多月的时间。他那种对党对人民忠心耿耿的革命精神，是我最难忘的。
    给老韩岭大队治“病”
    焦裕禄同志到兰考的第二天，他就深入到城关公社老韩岭大队。那次是我跟他一起去的。老韩岭大队从一九五九年到一九六二年连续遭受自然灾害侵袭，是个老灾队。可是，这并没有吓倒焦裕禄同志，他深入贫下中农家庭，作了一次访问，晚上又叫大队支部书记通知九个苦大家贫和种地有经验的老贫农，老党员进行座谈。通过座谈，找到了改变老韩岭面貌的途径：必须制定合理制度，保护好田间天然的泡桐树苗；必须根据沙地土质的特性，多种花生、棉花等经济作物，少种粮食作物（待桐树长起来形成林带能起防风固沙作用后，再适当增加粮食作物）；必须制定合理的牲畜繁殖奖罚三角合同，大力繁殖牲畜。改变老韩岭面貌的“药方”找到了。他对公社党委书记孟庆凯同志说：“贫下中农社员看得准，问题提得尖锐，方向看得明确，我们要坚决支持，照这样办下去一定能很快改变面貌。”自那以后，我和焦裕禄同志经常到老韩岭大队去参加劳动。现在，焦裕禄同志的预言已成为现实了，老韩岭大队的泡桐树已经普遍生长起来，防风林带已开始起到防风固沙的作用了。从一九六三年秋季起，这个大队“老灾队”的帽子已经摘掉，而且成为一个余粮队了。
    热爱兰考的一草一木
    一九六三年春节，我跟着焦裕禄同志一起到南彰公社去布置工作，经过小宋公社境地，焦裕禄同志看着小宋西部那些沙丘的土地说：“这些废堤和沙丘，普遍营造上树林，三五年之后，这里就变成绿洲，那时，树不是就成了摇钱树了吗！这废堤和沙丘旁边的土地，也可以变成肥沃的良田！”我们从红庙、小宋、南彰、张君墓、仪封等公社转了一圈回到县里。有一天，焦裕禄同志在县委办公室里说：“兰考好极了，真是个好地方。从这里物产来说，有小麦、高粱、大豆、花生，有大枣和苹果，有‘百合’和山药，有出名的兰考豆腐乳，特别是还有三十六万勤劳的人民。兰考潜力无穷，前途光明。不改变兰考面貌，我就不走！”
    焦裕禄同志的这些话，对我们教育很大。遍布兰考的大水坑、洼子窝、废堤、沙丘，历年来就没有收益过。不少同志，包括我在内，对耕种这些土地是没有信心的。但是，焦裕禄同志把那些土地看成三五年之后的“经济收入基地”“聚宝盆”“摇钱树”和盛产五谷的良田。我在兰考工作这些年来，老实说，我是感到灾区工作难做，虽然口头上没有提出什么要求，但是内心是很希望组织上把我调到外县去工作的。自从我跟随焦裕禄同志工作一段时期后，他那种在困难中看到光明的精神鼓舞着我，也使我充满了信心和力量。现在，我愿意在兰考干上一辈子了。
    革命需要什么就干什么
    有一次在县委办公室里，焦裕禄同志鼓励我们要学习写作，给报纸写稿、编现代戏。当时办公室的同志都说：“我们水平不高，写不好。”他说：“作为一个革命者，必须向困难作斗争。革命需要你干什么你就干什么，不会要去学！”接着他又说：“在一九四八年我刚到河南的时候，正是土地改革运动全面铺开的前夕，那时需要宣传，我们工作队就组织演戏，我没演过戏，也参加演了《血泪仇》和《白毛女》。在演《白毛女》中我扮演的杨白劳。”他还说：“一九五三年以前我是搞农村工作的，一九五三年以后，上级调我到洛阳矿山机器厂去搞工业了，真是什么也不懂，但是革命需要，就应该钻进去。”自那以后，我跟他在一起，就逐渐学着写文件。
    不忘过去
    焦裕禄同志出身于一个贫农的家庭里，自幼受尽了地主的压迫和剥削，生活过得不如牛马。他还受过日本帝国主义的欺压。有一次，他在城关公社干部会上讲生产救灾工作的时候，他说：“丰收地区出售余粮是反帝反修的爱国主义表现，咱们灾区搞好生产自救，少要国家的统销粮也同样是反帝反修的爱国主义表现。”会议结束，我们回来的路上，他说：“提起帝国主义的时候，我就想起了日本鬼子，我差一点死在他们手里。那年我被鬼子抓去当苦力，弄到东北关在一个地下室的监牢里，夏天热的不得了，他们不给水喝。后来大家选我当代表向鬼子要水喝，要了多次也不给。要得狠了，他们用水龙头往牢里喷水，把个监牢喷成了水牢，水齐胸深，冷水激得大家浑身发抖。还有一次开饭的时候，我当代表给大家发馍吃，发到末了，独独没有我的了。那时我饿得不行，就找日本鬼子要馍吃。他们不给，一个穿黄呢子衣服的鬼子，还用绳子套住我的脖子，让我爬行，我不听，他就用鞭子打我，一直被他打了几个小时，打得浑身稀烂。我们不能忘掉世界上还有帝国主义啊！”
