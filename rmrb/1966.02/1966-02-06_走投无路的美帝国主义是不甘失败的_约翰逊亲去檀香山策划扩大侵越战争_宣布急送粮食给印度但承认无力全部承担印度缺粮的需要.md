    Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from Washington: Due to the failure of the war of aggression against Vietnam and the bankruptcy of the "peace talks" fraud, U.S. President Johnson, trapped in a desperate situation, has decided to personally go to Honolulu to preside over a high-level meeting attended by top U.S. military and political officials and the heads of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, to discuss the "entire plan" for the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. This is the first time Johnson has left the U.S. mainland to plan the expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    According to Johnson himself at a press conference held on the 4th, he will fly to Honolulu on the afternoon of the 5th to hold a three-day meeting with U.S. Pacific Commander Sharp, U.S. "Ambassador" to Saigon Lodge, U.S. Commander in Vietnam Westmoreland, and Saigon puppet regime heads Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Van Thieu and other U.S.-puppet officials. Secretary of State Rusk, Secretary of Defense McNamara, and others will accompany him.

    Johnson said that the meeting "will discuss both non-military and military issues." He said, "Of course, we will have a very thorough military briefing, listening to anything Admiral Sharp and General Westmoreland deem worthy of mention. I want to understand them a little more clearly, and I want them to understand me a little more clearly."

    Answering reporters' questions, Johnson said, "We are going there to listen to reports on military and non-military situations, and to exchange views. I don't want to anticipate that we will start making some changes. I am unwilling to say that we will not learn something from this meeting that will either improve or strengthen the situation, but I don't want you to anticipate that the purpose of the meeting is to formulate any different policies, because that is not the purpose."

    Johnson also announced at the press conference that he has authorized the allocation of another three million tons of grain to India from the United States' "surplus" agricultural products. Together with the 3.5 million tons already allocated in the past, the total will reach 6.5 million tons. He said that what he is announcing now is the "most urgent allocation," and "this grain can be obtained immediately and shipped as quickly as possible" because India is facing a "very serious situation" due to drought and famine. He said that India "lacks approximately 19 million tons of grain." When Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi visits the United States in the near future, he will "further study these issues - common problems" with her to try to determine what measures the United States can take to "help" India, and also talk about what India can do to help the United States.

    Johnson admitted that the United States is unable to fully cover India's grain shortage. He said that the grain already promised to India has "reduced" the United States' grain reserves.

    走投无路的美帝国主义是不甘失败的
    约翰逊亲去檀香山策划扩大侵越战争
    宣布急送粮食给印度但承认无力全部承担印度缺粮的需要
    新华社五日讯　华盛顿消息：由于侵越战争失败和“和谈”骗局破产，陷于走投无路窘境的美国总统约翰逊决定亲自出马去檀香山，主持有美国军政大员和南越伪政权头目参加的高级会议，讨论美国侵越战争的“整个计划”。这是约翰逊为策划扩大侵越战争第一次离开美国大陆。
    据约翰逊本人在四日举行的记者招待会上宣布，他将在五日下午乘飞机前往檀香山，同太平洋美军总司令夏普、美国驻西贡“大使”洛奇、侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰以及西贡傀儡政权头目阮高其和阮文绍等美伪官员举行三天会议。国务卿腊斯克、国防部长麦克纳马拉等将随同他一起前往。
    约翰逊说，这次会议“将既讨论非军事问题，也讨论军事问题”。他说，“当然我们将非常彻底地进行军事汇报会，听取夏普海军上将和威斯特摩兰将军认为值得一提的任何情况。我愿稍为清楚地了解他们，我也愿他们稍为清楚地了解我。”
    约翰逊在回答记者问题时说，“我们到那里去是听取军事情况和非军事情况的汇报，并且交换意见。我不想预料会开始作出某种改变。我不愿意说，我们不会从这个会议了解到一些事情，使我们不是使局势好转就是使局势得到加强，但是我不希望你们预料会议的目的是制订任何不同的政策，因为目的不是这样的。”
    约翰逊在记者招待会上还宣布，他已经授权从美国的“剩余”农产品中再拨三百万吨粮食给印度。连同过去已拨的三百五十万吨，总数将达六百五十万吨。他说，他目前宣布的是“最紧急的指拨”，“这笔粮立刻就能拿到并尽快运去”，因为印度由于干旱和饥荒面对着“非常严重的局势”。他说，印度“缺少大约一千九百万吨粮食”。在印度总理英迪拉·甘地夫人在不久将来访问美国时，他将同她“进一步研究这些问题——共同的问题”，来设法确定美国对印度有所“帮助”所能采取的措施，并且也谈谈印度帮助美国所能够做的事情。
    约翰逊承认，美国无力全部承担印度缺粮的需要。他说，已经答应给印度的粮食已使美国粮食储备“减少”。
