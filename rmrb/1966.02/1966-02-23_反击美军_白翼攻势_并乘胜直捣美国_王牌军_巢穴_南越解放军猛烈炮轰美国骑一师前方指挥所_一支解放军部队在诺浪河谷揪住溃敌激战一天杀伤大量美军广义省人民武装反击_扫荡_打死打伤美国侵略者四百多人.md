　　Xinhua News Agency, February 21st Dispatch from Saigon: The South Vietnamese Liberation Army continued to fiercely strike the invading troops of the US 1st Cavalry Division on the 20th, vehemently counterattacking the "White Wing Offensive" launched by the enemy more than 20 days ago, which has already suffered a disastrous defeat.
　　According to Western news agencies, less than 24 hours after the 1st Cavalry Division's base at An Khe was fiercely bombarded by the Liberation Army, the Liberation Army again used mortars at 9:30 p.m. on the 20th to launch a fierce bombardment of the 1st Cavalry Division's forward command post for the "White Wing Offensive" near Bong Son. Many shells hit the command post and a nearby airport.
　　One of the shells exploded only 300 yards west of the tent of the 1st Cavalry Division Commander Kinnard. This sudden attack terrified the American aggressors.
　　They hurriedly dispatched aircraft to drop flares over the command post, and those planes continued to drop flares for more than an hour after the Liberation Army had stopped shelling.
　　During the day on the 20th, a unit of the Liberation Army in the Norang River Valley, about sixteen kilometers southwest of the enemy's forward command post, closely pursued the fleeing remnants of the 1st Battalion of the 5th Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division, and killed and wounded a large number of enemies in a day of fierce fighting.
　　It is reported that the American aggressors also used helicopters on the 20th to transport a company to the area about one and a half kilometers east of the command post, which the American aggressors fearfully call the "Little Iron Triangle," in an attempt to reinforce another 1st Cavalry Division unit surrounded there.
　　The Liberation Army launched multiple attacks on this enemy force that came to its death, engaging in fierce bayonet combat with the enemy, killing and wounding many enemies.
　　United Press International quoted a wounded American staff sergeant, Noe Henderson, as saying that when helicopters evacuated him from the area, "in his platoon, only three out of eleven men were not injured."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 22nd: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the liberation armed forces and guerrillas of Duc Pho District, Quang Ngai Province, South Vietnam, annihilated 539 enemies in the counter-"mopping-up" battles from January 28th to February 7th, including 409 American aggressor troops killed and wounded.
　　They also shot down 15 enemy aircraft, damaged 9, and captured a large number of weapons and military supplies.
　　In order to promote its so-called "Dry Season Offensive Plan," the American aggressors dispatched a regiment or more of American aggressor troops and puppet troops on January 27th, and under the coordination of 18 warships and 120 helicopters, carried out "mopping-up operations" in ten villages including Pho An, Pho Quang, Pho Minh, and Pho Van in Duc Pho District, Quang Ngai Province.
　　The soldiers and civilians of Duc Pho District, who had been waiting in full battle array, continuously attacked the enemy day and night as soon as they set foot on the land of Duc Pho District, causing heavy losses to the enemy.
　　In this counter-"mopping-up" battle, the guerrillas actively cooperated with the main force to attack the enemy mysteriously and unpredictably. The guerrillas of Pho An Village killed 56 American troops and wounded 3 in four days from January 28th to 31st. The guerrillas of this village also cooperated with the main force in combat, killing 80 American aggressor troops and wounding 18. The guerrillas of Pho Phong Village killed 43 American aggressor troops in the battle. The guerrillas of Pho Cuong Village also sneaked into the US military camp command post and killed 31 American bandits on the spot. (Attached picture)

    新华社二十一日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放军二十日继续痛击美国第一骑兵师的侵略军，猛烈反击敌人二十多天前发动的已经遭到惨重失败的“白翼攻势”。
    据西方通讯社报道，在骑一师的老巢安溪刚刚遭到解放军猛烈炮轰后不到二十四小时，解放军又在二十日晚九时半用迫击炮向骑一师设在蓬山附近“白翼攻势”的前方指挥所发动猛烈轰击。这个指挥所和邻近的一个机场附近中了许多炮弹。
    其中一颗炮弹就在骑一师师长金纳德的帐篷西边只有三百码的地方爆炸。这个突然的袭击使美国侵略者吓得心惊胆战。
    他们急忙出动飞机到指挥所上空乱扔照明弹，直到解放军已经停止炮轰了一个多小时以后，那些飞机还在那儿扔个不停。
    在二十日白天，解放军的一支部队在敌军前方指挥所西南约十六公里的诺浪河谷紧紧咬住了正在狼狈撤退的骑一师第五旅第一营的残兵败将，在一整天的激战中，杀伤了大量敌人。
    据报道，美国侵略者二十日还用直升飞机把一个连运到在指挥所东面约一公里半被美国侵略军心惊胆战地称为“小铁三角”的地区，企图增援被包围在那里的另一支骑一师部队。
    解放军向这股前来送死的敌军发动了多次进攻，同敌军展开激烈的白刃战，杀伤许多敌人。
    合众国际社援引一个被打伤的美军上士诺·亨德森的话说，当直升飞机把他从这个地区撤走的时候，“在他的一个班里，十一个人中只有三个人没有受伤”。
    新华社河内二十二日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广义省德普县解放武装力量和游击队在一月二十八日到二月七日的反“扫荡”战斗中，一举歼灭敌人五百三十九名，其中打死打伤美国侵略军四百零九名。
    他们还打落敌机十五架，击伤九架，并且缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    美国侵略者为了推行它的所谓“旱季进攻计划”，在一月二十七日出动了一个团以上的美国侵略军和仆从军，在十八艘战船、一百二十架直升飞机的配合下，向广义省德普县的普安、普光、普明、普文等十个乡进行“扫荡”。
    早已严阵以待的德普县军民，在敌人刚刚踏上德普县土地的时候，就不分昼夜地连续予以打击，使敌人损失惨重。
    在这次反“扫荡”战斗中，游击队积极配合主力部队，神出鬼没地打击敌人。普安乡游击队在一月二十八日到三十一日的四天中，就打死美军五十六名，打伤三名。这个乡游击队还配合主力部队作战，打死八十名美国侵略军，打伤十八名。普丰乡游击队在战斗中先后打死美国侵略军四十三名。普强乡游击队还潜入美军营指挥所，当场打死三十一名美国强盗。（附图片）
