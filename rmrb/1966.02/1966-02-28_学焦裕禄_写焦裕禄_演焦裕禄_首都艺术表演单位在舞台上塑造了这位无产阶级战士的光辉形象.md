　　Learn from Jiao Yulu, Write about Jiao Yulu, Perform Jiao Yulu
　　Capital Art Performance Units Shape the Brilliant Image of This Proletarian Fighter on Stage
    According to Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: Special evening performances dedicated to Jiao Yulu, a good student of Chairman Mao, performed by art performance units under the Ministry of Culture, began in the capital on the 24th and 26th in two separate shows. With the class sentiment of "Learn from Jiao Yulu, write about Jiao Yulu, perform Jiao Yulu," literary and art workers have shaped the brilliant image of this proletarian fighter on the stage.
    More than twenty programs were performed in the two evenings. Among them were dramas, operas, song and dance dramas, recitation dramas, linked performances, and choruses, and even more were shorter forms such as recitations, song performances, dances, solos, instrumental solos, Pingtan storytelling, and comic dialogues. Most of the programs had simple costumes, sets, and props, suitable for performances in urban theaters as well as in the countryside, factories, and army units, for introduction and promotion to the vast number of amateur literary and art activists among workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Many of the excellent programs in this performance were created in a very short time. The greatest feature of this creative activity was being both fast and good. Why could this be achieved? The answer from the creative staff was: first, due to the flexible study and application of Chairman Mao's works, resolutely highlighting politics; this is also the result of their persistent efforts in recent years to go deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, leading to more enriched life accumulation than in the past. Many creative staff members said excitedly: Now we are truly beginning to taste the "sweetness" of highlighting politics. This practice has strengthened our confidence in the revolutionization of creation.

　　学焦裕禄　写焦裕禄　演焦裕禄
　　首都艺术表演单位在舞台上塑造了这位无产阶级战士的光辉形象
    据新华社二十七日讯　由文化部所属艺术表演单位演出的歌唱毛主席的好学生焦裕禄专场晚会，二十四、二十六日起分两场先后在首都开始举行。文艺工作者们满怀着“学焦裕禄，写焦裕禄，演焦裕禄”的阶级感情，在舞台上塑造了这位无产阶级战士的光辉形象。
    两场晚会上共演出二十多个节目。其中有话剧、歌剧、歌舞剧、朗诵剧、联唱、合唱，更多的是形式比较短小的朗诵、歌表演、舞蹈、独唱、独奏、评弹、对口词等。大部分节目的服装布景道具都很简便，既可以在城市剧场演出，也适于下乡下厂下连队演出，向广大工农兵业余文艺活动积极分子介绍推广。
    这次演出的许多优秀节目都是在很短时间中创作出来的。既快又好，是这次创作活动的最大特色。为什么能做到这一点？创作人员们的回答是：首先是由于活学活用毛主席著作，坚决突出政治；这也是他们近年来坚持深入工农兵，生活积累比过去更充实的结果。许多创作人员兴奋地说：现在真正开始尝到突出政治的“甜头”了。这次实践使我们对创作革命化更加增强了信心。
