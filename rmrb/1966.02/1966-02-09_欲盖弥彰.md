    Trying to Conceal Only Makes It More Obvious
    Another batch of American "Peace Corps" members has arrived in Thailand to engage in activities. Thai Deputy Prime Minister Praphas Charusathien, at a "welcome" ceremony, requested that the American "Peace Corps," during their time in Thailand, particularly in public, "not act as if Americans are the masters of the Thai people."
    If the Americans were not the masters of the Thai reactionaries, why would Praphas Charusathien be worried and request that the Americans not act like masters? This is truly a case of trying to conceal only making it more obvious.

    欲盖弥彰
    又一批美国“和平队”到达泰国活动。泰国副总理巴博在“欢迎”仪式上，要求美国“和平队”在泰国期间，特别是在公众场合，“不要表现出美国人是泰国人的主子”。
    如果美国人不是泰国反动派的主子，巴博又何必担心，并且要求美国人不要表现出主子的样子呢？这真正是所谓欲盖弥彰。
