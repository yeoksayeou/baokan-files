    Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds tell us: To ensure that all cadres and all work in the county emphasize politics, the county Party committee leadership must first emphasize politics. For the county Party committee leadership to emphasize politics, the key lies in:
　　We "Squad Leaders" Must First Emphasize Politics
    I was thinking: The most important reason why Comrade Jiao Yulu was able to do so much that greatly benefited the people of Lankao in such a short period of time is that he emphasized politics. He truly used Mao Zedong Thought as his guiding principle. He truly followed Chairman Mao's instructions—to serve the people completely and thoroughly—to guide his actions. To learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, we must emphasize politics like him, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, make great efforts in the "application" aspect, and be consistent in learning and application, in words and deeds.
    In the past, we often talked about emphasizing politics in words, and we also did some political and ideological work, achieving certain results. But politics was always not emphasized prominently. Why is this? Through study and comparison with Comrade Jiao Yulu, I deeply realized: The key problem is that we do not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of emphasizing politics. In actual work, we often consciously or unconsciously equate the relationship between politics and professional work, and sometimes even reverse it. We mistakenly believe that good production means good politics. Therefore, when arranging work, inspecting work, and summarizing work, we often revolve around production measures and do not put effort into political and ideological work. As a result, we are not politically strong enough, which leads to not being strong enough in production.
    The fundamental reason for not emphasizing politics well is that we have not studied Chairman Mao's works enough. We have not armed ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought like Comrade Jiao Yulu. We have studied a lot of Chairman Mao's works, and they have played a significant role, but we have not studied as diligently as Comrade Jiao Yulu, and we have not transformed ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought as strictly as Comrade Jiao Yulu. We have studied Chairman Mao's works mainly to educate others and to solve a specific work problem. Because our attitude towards learning is not correct enough, we have not truly mastered Mao Zedong Thought, and we have not truly solved the problem of serving the people completely and thoroughly in our thinking. The problem of learning attitude, in the final analysis, is a matter of class feeling. What kind of ideological feelings you have determines what kind of learning attitude and learning effect you have. The reason why Comrade Jiao Yulu was able to persistently study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way is mainly because he had deep class feelings for the working people. He deeply understood that Chairman Mao's works spoke the words that millions of working people wanted to say, and that Chairman Mao's every word represented the interests of the people. Therefore, he had a deep affection for Chairman Mao's works. He urgently needed to study Chairman Mao's works well and use Mao Zedong Thought to better serve the working people. To study Chairman Mao's works well, we must regard studying Chairman Mao's works as our conscious action, and we must establish the idea of being highly responsible to the people. Only in this way can we study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a down-to-earth manner and achieve consistency in learning and application, in words and deeds.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds also tell us: To ensure that all cadres and all work in the county emphasize politics, the county Party committee leadership must first emphasize politics. For the county Party committee leadership to emphasize politics, the key again lies in us "squad leaders" emphasizing politics. In the past, we did not have a sufficient understanding or deep experience of this issue. In the past, we had more verbal teaching than personal example, and we saw more problems below and less self-criticism. Comrade Jiao Yulu emphasized personal example over verbal teaching, setting an example of emphasizing politics in front of all the cadres and people of the county. Therefore, every word he spoke was genuine and had weight, and his every word and action influenced all the cadres and people of the county. Comrade Jiao Yulu's living example has made us further understand: We are the leaders of the revolutionary people of the county, and our every move has a pivotal impact on the people of the county and the work of the county. We bear the great responsibility entrusted to us by the Party and the 500,000 people of the county. To complete the great tasks entrusted to us by the Party and the people of the county well and without compromise, we must read Chairman Mao's books seriously and solemnly with a highly responsible attitude towards the people, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and realize ideological revolutionization and the revolutionization of the county Party committee leadership as soon as possible.

### 我们当“班长”的首先要突出政治

专栏：

    焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹告诉我们：要全县干部、全县工作突出政治，首先要县委领导突出政治，要县委领导突出政治，关键在于：
　　我们当“班长”的首先要突出政治
    我在想：焦裕禄同志所以能够在短短的时间内，做出大大有益于兰考人民的事情，最重要的一条，是他突出了政治，他真正用毛泽东思想挂了帅，他真正是按照毛主席的指示——完全、彻底地为人民——来指导自己的行动的。要学习焦裕禄同志，就要象他那样突出政治，象他那样活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，学用一致，言行一致。
    过去，我们在口头上也常讲突出政治，政治思想工作也做了一些，取得了一定的成绩。但政治总是突不出，这是为什么？通过学习，对照焦裕禄同志，使我深深体会到：关键问题是：对突出政治的重大意义认识不足，在实际工作中，常常自觉不自觉地把政治和业务的关系平列起来，有时甚至颠倒过来，错误地认为生产好就是政治好，因而在布置工作、检查工作、总结工作时，常在生产措施上打转转，没有在政治思想工作上下功夫。结果政治上不过硬，带来了生产不过硬。
    没有很好地突出政治，归根到底又是对毛主席著作学得不够。没有象焦裕禄同志那样，首先用毛泽东思想武装自己，我们学习毛主席著作，学了不少，作用也不小，但学得不如焦裕禄同志那样认真，用毛泽东思想来改造自己不如焦裕禄同志那样严格；我们学习毛主席著作，在多数情况下，只是为了教育别人的，为了解决某一项工作问题。由于学习态度不够端正，因此没有真正把毛泽东思想学到手，在思想上没有真正解决完全、彻底地为人民服务的问题。学习态度问题，归根结蒂又是个阶级感情的问题。有什么样的思想感情就有什么样的学习态度、学习效果。焦裕禄同志所以能够坚持不懈地活学活用毛主席著作，主要是他和劳动人民具有深厚的阶级感情。他深深懂得，毛主席著作讲出了千百万劳动人民要讲的话，毛主席的一言一语，代表了人民的利益，因此，他对毛主席著作有了深厚的感情。他迫切需要把毛主席著作学好，用毛主席思想去更好地为劳动人民服务。我们要学好毛主席著作，要把学习毛主席著作当作自己自觉的行动，必须树立对人民高度负责的思想，只有这样，才能踏踏实实地活学活用毛主席著作，才能做到学用一致，言行一致。
    焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹，也告诉我们：要全县干部、全县工作突出政治，首先要县委领导突出政治，要县委领导突出政治，关键又在于我们当“班长”的突出政治。对于这个问题，我们过去认识不足、体会不深。我们过去是言教多，身教少；看到下面的问题多，严于责己少。焦裕禄同志身教重于言教，在全县干部、全县人民面前做出了突出政治的样子，因此他讲出的每一句话是实在的，是有份量的，他的一言一行在影响着全县干部、全县人民。焦裕禄同志的这个活榜样，使我们进一步懂得：我们是全县革命人民的带队人，我们的一举一动对全县人民、对全县工作起着举足轻重的作用，我们担负着党和全县五十万人民交给我们的重大责任。要很好地不折不扣地完成党和全县人民交给我们的伟大任务，我们必须抱着对人民高度负责的态度，认真严肃地去读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，尽速实现思想革命化，实现县委领导革命化。
