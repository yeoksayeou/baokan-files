    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 10th: According to the Cambodian News Agency on February 10th, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk wrote to the President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh, on February 3rd, stating, "Cambodia firmly supports the four-point position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the positions put forward by the National Liberation Front, the sole legal representative of the people of South Vietnam."
    Prince Sihanouk's letter was in reply to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's letter to him on January 24th.
    Prince Sihanouk's reply stated: "On behalf of the Cambodian people and the Royal Government, and in my own name, I would like to once again assure Your Excellency and our Vietnamese brothers of our solidarity and full support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese brothers."
    The reply stated: "We fully agree with our Vietnamese brothers' view regarding the so-called 'peace offensive' launched by the American leaders in an attempt to deceive international public opinion. Cambodia can confirm that, while carrying out this hypocritical offensive, the Cambodian border adjacent to Thailand and South Vietnam is subjected to increasingly fierce provocations and attacks. The fact that the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has resumed has shown to the people of the world that the United States has not abandoned its plan to enslave the countries of Southeast Asia by force."
    The reply pointed out: "The American expeditionary forces' barbaric war against the people of South Vietnam, and the American Air Force's terrorist bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, are undeniable and shameless violations of the 1954 Geneva Accords, the United Nations Charter, and all international laws. We therefore do not quite understand why certain countries actually support or do not firmly condemn the American imperialist aggressors."
    Prince Sihanouk guaranteed in his reply that "Cambodia will spare no effort to strengthen the unity of the Indochinese peoples, who are determined to defend their independence, which is threatened by American neo-colonialist policies."
    The reply stated: "We have severed all relations with the American imperialists and their Saigon and Bangkok lackeys, and are convinced that this decision is a worthy example for all countries that oppose imperialism. We believe that this is a fundamental measure to express condemnation of the aggressors and resolutely resist their evil activities. We still hope that all countries that uphold justice and love peace will, according to their possibilities, provide the Vietnamese people with all forms of assistance they deserve."
    The reply concluded, "I would like to express to you my conviction that, despite the severe trials imposed on the Vietnamese people by the American imperialists, and despite the fact that the American imperialists also seem to be prepared to impose such trials on the Cambodian people, the aggressors will inevitably suffer an irreversible defeat. The fighting solidarity that binds together the peoples of our Indochina countries, as well as the increasing assistance from friendly countries and the peoples of the world, will prove our belief in the future."

    西哈努克亲王复函胡志明主席
    柬埔寨全力支持越南人民正义斗争
    印度支那人民团结战斗必将挫败美国侵略者
    新华社金边十日电　据柬埔寨新闻社十日报道：柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王二月三日写信给越南民主共和国主席胡志明说：“柬埔寨坚决支持越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方人民唯一的合法代表、民族解放阵线所提出的主张。”
    西哈努克亲王的信是答复胡志明主席一月二十四日给他的信件的。
    西哈努克亲王的复信说：“我谨代表柬埔寨人民和王国政府，并以我个人的名义，再一次向阁下和我们的越南兄弟保证，我们声援和全力支持越南兄弟的正义斗争。”
    复信说：“我们完全同意我们越南兄弟关于美国领导人为了企图欺骗国际舆论而进行的所谓‘和平攻势’的观点。柬埔寨可以证实，在进行这一伪善的攻势时，同泰国和南越交界的柬埔寨边境受到越来越猛烈的挑衅和进攻。恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸这一事实已经向全世界人民表明，美国根本没有放弃它用武力奴役东南亚各国的计划。”
    复信指出：“美国远征军对南越人民的野蛮战争，美国空军对越南民主共和国的恐怖轰炸，是对一九五四年日内瓦协议、联合国宪章和所有国际法的无可否认的无耻破坏。因此我们不大理解，某些国家为什么竟然支持或者不坚决谴责美帝国主义侵略者。”
    西哈努克亲王在复信中保证，“柬埔寨将不遗余力地加强我们决心捍卫遭到美国新殖民主义政策威胁的独立的印度支那各国人民的团结。”
    复信说：“我们已经同美帝国主义者及其西贡和曼谷的走狗断绝一切关系，并且确信，这一决定是值得所有反对帝国主义的国家学习的榜样。我们认为，这是表示谴责侵略者和坚决抵抗侵略者的罪恶活动的一个根本措施。我们仍然希望，所有主持正义和爱好和平的国家，根据它们的可能，给予越南人民以应有的各种形式的援助。”
    复信最后说，“我要向你表示，我确信，尽管越南人民受到美帝国主义者强加到他们头上的严酷考验，尽管美帝国主义者看来也准备把这种考验强加到柬埔寨人民头上，侵略者必将遭到无可挽回的失败。把我们印度支那各国人民连接在一起的战斗团结，以及友好国家和世界各国人民的日益增强的援助，将证实我们对前途的信念。”
