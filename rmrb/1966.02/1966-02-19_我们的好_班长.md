    Our Good "Squad Leader"
    Zhang Qinli, Deputy Secretary of the Lankao County Party Committee, Henan

    Comrade Jiao Yulu, Chairman Mao’s good student and our good “squad leader,” has been gone from us for almost two years. For two years, the people of Lankao and the cadres of Lankao have been missing Comrade Jiao Yulu. Whenever he is mentioned, many feel a force urging them to advance bravely in the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao.

      In the most difficult times for the people of Lankao, Comrade Jiao Yulu held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and pointed out the way forward for the people. He armed our county committee with Mao Zedong Thought, giving us the confidence and courage to lead the masses and rely on the masses to overcome the "three harms." In the struggle to eliminate the "three harms," he was adept at following the mass line and at "concentrating, persisting." Therefore, he was also the most heroic and courageous person in the struggle.

    Hanging on my desk is the photo he gave me in the hospital before his death. He always carried this photo with him. At the bottom of the photo, there is a mottled area, stained by the cold sweat that flowed from him due to liver pain while working and lying in bed. On the left side of the photo, I hung his delegate card for the First Congress of the Second Henan Provincial Party Congress. On the right, I hung his presidium card for the county party congress. Whenever I encounter difficulties or successes in my work, I sit at my desk at night, facing Comrade Jiao Yulu, thinking about the Party's teachings, thinking about how I should work. In times of difficulty, he gave me strength; in times of success, he made me vigilant. At this time, the image of Comrade Jiao Yulu comes alive before my eyes...

            An Optimistic and Generous Person

    I first saw him at a county party committee meeting. This simple stranger did not attract my attention at the time. I just regarded him as a cadre sent by a higher level to do disaster relief work. However, he was very interested in everyone's speech, listening attentively, and asking for clarification of some important details. His eager, thirsty desire to understand the situation strongly attracted me. Chairman Mao said that the thing to fear most in all matters is carelessness. This person listened to others so carefully, and I really wanted to know who this careful person was.

    When I learned that he was the newly arrived County Party Secretary, Comrade Jiao Yulu, I went straight to look for him. He was not in his room, and the next day I went to look for him again. He had already gone to the countryside.

    He returned to the county party committee seven or eight days later. At the county party committee meeting, he spoke with relish about how Lankao was a place with great potential. That optimistic and generous mood deeply infected me. I had rarely heard this kind of statement in the past. He said: "The masses are willing to plant *Xiangchun* willows on saline-alkali land. *Xiangchun* willows bloom once in spring, once in summer, and once again in autumn, experiencing three springs and blooming three times in a year, so they are called 'Three Spring Willows.' The people of Lankao pronounce 'three' as 'fragrant,' which is very interesting." Comrade Jiao Yulu's words stunned me. That vast expanse of white saline-alkali land was actually a place of fragrant flowers for three seasons. I was a native of Lankao, but I had never noticed this common thing in the past. He, a Shandong native, learned the details of the *Xiangchun* willows after surveying the masses for only a few days. Speaking of Lankao paulownia, Comrade Jiao Yulu was even more excited. He said: "Lankao paulownia is famous at home and abroad. It is sold abroad to earn foreign exchange, which can support national construction." Then he said with great regret: "There is not enough care for paulownia trees. The young shoots growing from the roots of old paulownia trees can be cultivated into large trees, but they are not well protected now, and some have been eaten by sheep, which is a real pity." After the meeting, he asked me to go to the timber company together to investigate the purchase and export of paulownia boards. When he learned that each cubic meter of paulownia board was worth more than one hundred yuan, he was extremely happy.

    At that time, we were all overwhelmed by the serious disaster relief work. He, however, was so optimistic and full of confidence in the future of the entire county. This reminded me of Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: "Our comrades must see the achievements, see the light, and increase our courage in difficult times." It was because Comrade Jiao Yulu armed his mind with Mao Zedong Thought that he was able to naturally view Lankao with a one-divides-into-two perspective. As soon as he arrived, he used Chairman Mao's viewpoint to correct our views; as soon as he arrived, he raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and used the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle to improve the overall work of our county committee.

        Conduct Investigation and Research Before Holding Unprepared Meetings

    One day, I stood with him on a large embankment north of the city. Seeing a cloud of yellow sand rolling in from the northern sky, he asked: "Where does this wind come from?" I said: "It comes from the old course of the Yellow River behind Zhu'an Village." He said: "Wind has wind paths, and people have human paths. I don't know where this wind and sand fall." At this time, I noticed that the wind and sand did indeed have a path. The head of the wind advanced not far before splitting into a southwest route and a southeast route, sweeping away. From then on, Comrade Jiao Yulu proposed the suggestion of investigating wind gaps and water paths.

    He and the comrades of the county committee often lived in production teams, conducting investigations and research, and leading the masses in the struggle against disasters. When he or other members discovered a problem in their investigation and research that needed to be resolved by a county party committee meeting, he would call us and tell us in detail. He talked about the situation so meticulously that he could even recite a long list of the names of poor and lower-middle peasants and their specific opinions. Finally, he always put forward his own work suggestions. After he finished speaking, he would ask: "Is there a similar situation in your area? If so, what do you have to add?" If he encountered any problems in the county party committee office, he would also personally call each county party committee member in the countryside to solicit opinions. At this time, simply expressing agreement was not enough. He required you to provide specific information from below to illustrate whether the problems he raised were in line with reality. The process of this exchange was actually a process of enabling the comrades of the county party committee to reach a unified understanding of the problems, and a process of preparing for a county party committee meeting. When everything had been brewing for a while, he would set a date for everyone to return to the county party committee for a meeting. At the meeting, everyone spoke enthusiastically and expressed their opinions. In a short period of time, a resolution was formed. Finally, he always said: "Let's go our separate ways." We took the concentrated opinions and went our separate ways to implement them.

    Chairman Mao said: "Meetings should be notified in advance, ... and prepared early." "If there is no preparation, do not rush to hold a meeting." He also said: "The members of the Party committee should notify each other and exchange information about what they know. This is very important for achieving a common language." Comrade Jiao Yulu led the county party committee meetings in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings. The "preparation" he advocated was to conduct investigation and research in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, and to "exchange intelligence" during the investigation and research process. Because our "squad leader" took the lead in doing this and urged everyone to do this, the county party committee meetings were both short and solved problems.

              Attitude Towards Dissenting Opinions

    At county party committee meetings, Comrade Jiao Yulu always chose a place where he could see every comrade and hear every word. He would spread out four or five notebooks in front of him and listen attentively. He would write down good experiences in one notebook and problems raised in another. Even when listening to reports on relevant situations, he would record them in different categories. This method of recording was well-suited to his habit of writing reports and summaries himself. He never asked comrades in the office to draft reports for him.

    The opinions of the county party committee were not always unanimous. Often, if a comrade raised incorrect opinions in the discussion, he would always give that comrade many inspirations in his conclusion, leaving him room for consideration and room for practice.

    Once, the Standing Committee discussed dismantling the old Taihang Dike because this dike obstructed drainage during the flood season. The plan was drafted by me. I said: "It will take a year and a half to complete this plan." Comrade Jiao Yulu asked: "Can it be completed in three months?" I said definitively: "No." I had made detailed calculations of manpower and work efficiency. Jiao Yulu said: "Think again." I didn't believe it could be completed in three months and said: "Our opinions are inconsistent." Hearing this very heavy sentence, he smiled. He said: "Think about how water flows. Water doesn't flow all over the ground, it flows along the depressions. Let's go and see again. If we dig some openings along the flow in the low-lying areas and do less work, maybe it can be completed in two or three months." After hearing his words, I ran to the Taihang Dike the next day. As soon as I saw it, I suddenly realized that the dike did not need to be completely dismantled. As long as three openings, each a hundred or so steps wide, were dug at the water-blocking points, it would be enough. When making the plan, I had been here four or five times. Only this time did I see the real problem. As a result, this work was completed in only a week, and flood drainage was very smooth during the flood season.

    Chairman Mao said: "Correct opinions must be listened to and acted upon." "Incorrect opinions from below must also be listened to. It is wrong not to listen at all; however, if you listen but do not act upon them, you must criticize them." Comrade Jiao Yulu did things in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions.

            Understanding and Friendship Among Comrades

    Comrade Jiao Yulu advocated implementing "face-to-face leadership and painstaking education" for cadres. He regarded this as a matter of emotion in dealing with class brothers. For this reason, he was happy to receive criticism from comrades who did not understand him, even if it was temporary. Comrade Lao Pan, a member of the Standing Committee of the county party committee, once had different opinions on his approach. Once, at a county party committee meeting, Lao Pan raised sharp criticisms of his approach, speaking in a loud voice and with a flushed face. Comrade Jiao Yulu, however, smiled without the slightest change in expression. He was truly a person without selfish thoughts or distracting ideas, a pure person. For the benefit of the people, he could listen to anything.

    Chairman Mao said that understanding, support, and friendship between the secretary and the members are more important than anything else. Comrade Jiao Yulu was a person who forgot "self." Although Lao Pan's opinion was not correct, he understood that Lao Pan thought he was right and put forward the opinion for the benefit of the revolution. Therefore, he acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, understood Lao Pan, and emphasized unity and friendship rather than handling the matter based on whether he himself felt "wronged" or in how he handled the relationship between comrades.

  He firmly believes in the power of the masses
  And the wisdom is endless
    Sometimes, what seems like an ordinary thing to us, Comrade Jiao Yulu can immediately identify as a shining treasure. There was a time when we wanted to find a way to control sandstorms that would be more effective than planting trees to fix the sand. But where was it? Comrade Jiao Yulu said: "The masses have rich experience." When we heard this, we thought that even the masses in the areas affected by sandstorms were helpless.

    Once, I heard from Wei Duobin, a poor peasant in Zhangzhuang, that he had sealed his mother's grave with silt in one morning, and in the years since, the grave had not been blown away by the wind and sand. I told Comrade Jiao Yulu about this, and he said: "One person, one grave, one morning, can be successful. Using the power of the people's commune, one hundred people, one thousand people, ten thousand people, hundreds of thousands of people, working for one year, two years, three years, all the sand dunes near where silt can be obtained, will be sealed with silt, planted with trees, and planted with grass. Wouldn't that turn the terrifying sand dunes into beautiful landscapes!"

    I was very excited when I heard these words. We immediately conducted further investigations and small-scale experiments, and after success, we vigorously promoted it. In just three months, the entire county sealed off more than a thousand sand dunes that were harmful to crops.

    There are many more examples like this of going from the masses to the masses in Comrade Jiao Yulu. I often think, why was he able to do this? I found the answer in Chairman Mao's writings. Chairman Mao said: "The people, and the people alone, are the driving force in the making of world history." He also said: "The masses have boundless creative power." It was precisely because Comrade Jiao Yulu armed his mind with Mao Zedong Thought that he discovered "treasures" among the people.

    Comrade Jiao Yulu, learn from you, be your successor

    I keep in mind many of the things Jiao Yulu said to me. I am especially excited every time I think of what he said to me. He said, "You fought battles on this land during the war years; you are engaged in construction on this land during the construction period. How happy!" This sentence has a thousand pounds of weight in my heart. Every time I remember his words, the scene of Comrade Fan Huang, the former county party committee secretary, sacrificing himself in Lankao during the war years, and the scene of nine comrades sacrificing themselves one after another within a month, appear before my eyes. Now, behind this group of people, there is another tall and heroic proletarian fighter—Comrade Jiao Yulu, who sacrificed his life for the people of Lankao. In front of these martyrs, in front of Comrade Jiao Yulu, I can only feel a little more at ease by fighting and working like them. Comrade Jiao Yulu, I will definitely learn from you and be your successor. I will arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought and contribute everything I have to building a new Lankao.

    我们的好“班长”
    河南兰考县委副书记　张钦礼
    毛主席的好学生，我们的好“班长”焦裕禄同志离开我们快两年了。两年来，兰考人民，兰考的干部，一直在怀念着焦裕禄同志。一提起他来，很多人就觉得有一股力量，督促着自己按照毛主席指出的方向奋勇前进。
      在兰考人民最困难的时候，焦裕禄同志高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，给人们指明了前进的道路；他用毛泽东思想武装了我们县委这“一班人”，使我们有了领导群众、依靠群众战胜“三害”的信心和勇气。而在除治“三害”的斗争中，又是他善于走群众路线，善于“集中起来，坚持下去”，因此，他在斗争中也是最英勇最果敢的人。
    在我的案头挂着他那张临终前在医院给我的照片。这张照片他曾经带在身上。照片的下部，有一片花斑，是他在工作中，在病床上，因肝痛而流出的冷汗所浸染的。在照片左边，我挂上了他的出席党的河南省二届一次代表大会的代表证，在右边挂上了他的党的县代表大会的主席团证。每当我工作遇到困难或者顺利的时候，我便在夜里坐在案前，面对着焦裕禄同志，想着党的教导，想着我该怎样去工作。困难时他给了我力量，顺利时他让我警惕。这时，焦裕禄同志的形象，就在我的眼前活动起来……
            一个乐观而豪爽的人
    我是在县委会上第一次看见他的。这个朴素的陌生人，当时并没有引起我的注意，只把他当作是上级派来搞救灾工作的干部。但是，他对每个人的发言都很有兴趣，专注地倾听着，而且要问清一些重要的细节。他那种如饥如渴急切地要了解情况的样子，强烈地吸引了我。毛主席说，一切事情最怕认真。这个人听人家讲话是那样的认真，我很想弄清这个认真的人是谁。
    我一知道他是新来的县委书记焦裕禄同志时，便径直地去找他，他不在屋，第二天又去找，他已经下乡走了。
    他回到县委来是七八天以后。在县委会上，他津津有味地讲着兰考是个大有可为的地方。那种乐观、豪爽的情绪，深深地感染了我。这种说法，我过去是很少听到的。他说：“群众愿意在盐碱地上种香春柳。香春柳春天开一次花，夏天开一次花，秋天又开一次花，一年过三个春天，开三次花，所以叫‘三春柳’。兰考人把‘三’字念成了‘香’字，是很有意思的。”焦裕禄同志的这些话，简直使我听呆了。那白茫茫的盐碱地，竟是个三季春花一片郁香的地方。我是个土生土长的兰考人，过去却没有注意这个常见的东西。而他，是个山东人，几天内向群众调查就摸到了香春柳的底细。说起兰考的泡桐来，焦裕禄同志的兴致更高了。他说：“兰考泡桐，闻名中外，卖到国外去，换取外汇，能支援国家建设。”接着他又很惋惜地说：“对泡桐爱护不够。老桐树根部生的幼芽，可以培植成大树，现在没有保护好，有的被羊啃掉了，实在可惜。”散会后，他约我一同去木材公司，调查桐板的收购和出口情况。当他知道每立方米桐板价值一百多元时，高兴极了。
    当时，我们都被严重的救灾工作压的喘不过气来。而他，却是这样的乐观，对全县的前途这样充满信心。这使我想起了毛主席的教导。毛主席说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”焦裕禄同志正是由于用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑，才能够很自然地用一分为二的观点看待兰考。他一来，就用毛主席的观点端正我们的看法；他一来，就举起毛泽东思想这面伟大的红旗，用自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，改进我们县委的全盘工作。
        先做调查研究不开无准备的会
    一天，我同他站在城北一条大堤上。见北方半空，一片黄色的风沙滚滚而来。他问道：“这风是从哪里来的？”我说：“是从朱庵村后的黄河故道里。”他说：“风有风路，人有人路。不知道这风沙落向哪里？”这时，我才注意到风沙确实是有路的，这个风头前进了不远，就一路西南，一路东南，浩荡而去。从此焦裕禄同志提出了查风口查水路的建议。
    他和县委的同志们，经常住在生产队里，调查研究，领导群众和灾害斗争。当他或别的委员在调查研究中发现了什么问题，需要县委开会解决时，他就打电话详细的告诉我们。他对情况谈的是那样的细致，甚至能说出一大串贫农社员的名字和他们的具体意见。最后，他总是提出自己的工作建议。他说完了，就问道：“你那里是不是也有这种情况？假若是的，你有什么补充？”他若在县委机关遇到了什么问题，也亲自打电话给在乡下的每一位县委委员，征求意见。这时，你简单地表示同意是不行的，他要求你拿出下边的具体情况，来说明他提的问题是不是合乎实际。这种情况交流的过程，实际上是让县委的同志们对问题取得一致认识的过程，是对县委一次会议进行准备的过程。等到一切都酝酿得差不多了，他便约定一个日子，大家一同回到县委开会。会上，大家发言热烈，各抒己见。只用不长的时间，就形成了决议。最后，他总是说：“各奔前程吧。”我们带着集中起来的意见，又分头去执行了。
    毛主席说：“开会要事先通知，……并且早作准备。”“如果没有准备，就不要急于开会。”又说：“党委各委员之间要把彼此知道的情况互相通知、互相交流。这对于取得共同的语言是很重要的。”焦裕禄同志正是按照毛主席的教导来领导县委会议的。他提倡的“准备”，就是按照毛主席的指示，去作调查研究，并在调查研究的过程中“互通情报”。因为我们的“班长”带头这样做，督促大家这样做，因此，县委会议开起来既短又解决问题。
              对待不同意见的态度
    县委开会，焦裕禄同志总是选一个能看到每一个同志，能听见每一句话的地方坐下来，在面前摊出四五个笔记本子，全神贯注地倾听别人发言。他一会儿在这个本子上记下好的经验，一会儿在那个本子上记下提出的问题，就是听有关情况的汇报，他也是分门别类记录的。这种记录方法，很适合他亲自写报告，写总结的习惯，他从来不叫办公室的同志为他起草报告。
    县委会的意见并不都是一致的。常有一个同志在讨论中提出了不正确的意见，他在做结论时，总是给这个同志许多启示，给他留下考虑的余地，留下实践的余地。
    有一次常委会讨论拆除旧有的太行堤，因为这个堤在汛期阻碍排水。规划是我起草的。我说：“要一年半时间才能完成这项计划。”焦裕禄同志问道：“能不能三个月完成？”我肯定说：“不能。”我是作过详细的人力、工效的计算的。焦裕禄说：“你再想想。”我不相信三个月能完成，说：“咱俩的意见不一致。”听了这句很重的话，他笑了。说：“你想一想，水是怎么流的？水不是漫地流，是顺着泊洼流的。咱们再去看看，在低洼处顺着流势扒一些口子，少做些工，也许两三个月就能完成它。”听了他的话，第二天我就跑到太行堤上去看。一看，我恍然大悟，事实正是那样，大堤无需全部拆除，只要在阻水口扒三个各有百十步宽的口子，就行了。作规划时，我曾经到这里看过四五次。唯有这次看，才看到了真正的问题。结果，只用一周时间，就做完了这项工作，汛期排涝十分顺利。
    毛主席说：“对正确的意见，必须听，并且照它做。”“对下面来的错误意见也要听，根本不听是不对的；不过听了而不照它做，并且要给以批评。”焦裕禄同志正是按照毛主席的指示办事的。
            同志间的谅解和友谊
    焦裕禄同志主张对干部实行“面对面的领导，苦口婆心的教育”。他把这看作是对待阶级兄弟的感情问题。为此，他即使受了暂时不了解他的同志们的批评，也甘之如饴。县委常委老潘同志就是对他的这种作法曾经有过不同意见的。有一次，在县委会议上，老潘对他的这种作法，提出了尖锐的批评，说话的声音很大，脸都气红了。而焦裕禄同志却微笑着，连一点儿声色都没有。他真是个没有私心杂念的人，一个纯粹的人，为了人民的利益，他是什么话都能听下去的。
    毛主席说，书记和委员之间的谅解、支援和友谊，比什么都重要。焦裕禄同志是一个忘“我”的人，老潘那个意见尽管不正确，但是他理解老潘自以为对，才为革命利益提出的。因此，他按毛主席的指示办，谅解老潘，以团结、友谊为重，而不以个人是否“委屈”来处理问题，来处理同志间的关系。
  他坚信群众的力量
  和智慧无穷无尽
    有时，在我们眼里是一件平凡的事物，叫焦裕禄同志一鉴定，立即成了金光闪闪的宝物。有一个时期，我们想用比植树固沙见效更快的办法，来制服沙害。但是，那里有呢？焦裕禄同志说：“群众那里有丰富的经验”。我们听了这话，当时却想，受沙害的地区，群众也是束手无策。
    有一次，我从张庄的贫农魏铎彬的口中，听说他用淤泥土在一个早上把他母亲的坟封住了，几年内，这个坟再没有被风沙吹动。我把这件事对焦裕禄同志说了，他说：“一个人，一个坟，一个早晨，就能成功。我们运用人民公社的力量，一百人，一千人，一万人，十几万人，干一年，二年，三年，凡是近处有淤泥可取的沙丘，都用淤泥封住，栽上树，种上草，岂不是把骇人听闻的沙丘，变成了锦绣！”
    他这一片话，我听了很激动。我们立即进一步作了调查和小面积试验，成功后大力推广。全县只用三个月的时间，就把为害农作物的一千多个沙丘，全部封住了。
    象这样从群众中来到群众中去的事例，在焦裕禄同志身上还有很多。我常常想，他为什么能够做到这一点呢？在毛主席的著作里我找到了答案。毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”又说：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”焦裕禄同志正是因为用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑，才在人民群众中发现了“珍宝”。
    焦裕禄同志，学习你，做你的后来人
    焦裕禄对我说过的许多话，我都时刻铭记在心。每想起他对我说的这样的话，就特别激动。他说：“战争年代，你在这块土地上打仗；建设时期，你在这块土地上搞建设。多高兴呀！”这句话，在我心里有千百斤重的分量。每记起他这段话，战争年代前县委书记范黄同志在兰考牺牲的情景，九个同志在一个月内先后牺牲的情景，都出现在我的面前。如今，在这一群人的后面，又多了一个高大英勇的无产阶级战士——为兰考人民献出了生命的焦裕禄同志。在这些先烈面前，在焦裕禄同志面前，我只有象他们那样的斗争、工作，才觉得稍稍心安一点。焦裕禄同志，我一定学习你，做你的后来人。用毛泽东思想武装自己，为建设新兰考，贡献出自己的一切。
