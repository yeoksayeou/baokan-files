    Indonesian right-wing organization mobs attacked our embassy.
    They wantonly damaged our embassy buildings, injured one of our embassy staff members, smashed our national emblem, stole the embassy's bronze plaque, shouted anti-China slogans, and smeared anti-China slogans. The military police present stood by and even encouraged them. Our embassy repeatedly called the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Police, and other relevant departments, but they never took any security measures.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 3rd: Indonesian right-wing forces openly organized a group of thugs on the 3rd to barbarously attack the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia. These thugs, with the connivance of the Indonesian military police present, wantonly damaged the embassy buildings and injured one of the embassy staff members. This is the most serious incident to date in the planned sabotage of relations between China and Indonesia by Indonesian right-wing forces.
    At 13:10 on the 3rd, more than 1,000 thugs claiming to belong to the "Indonesian University Students Unified Action Command" arrived at the Chinese Embassy in approximately 30 trucks (including two armored vehicles of the Indonesian armed forces), more than 20 motorcycles and other vehicles to carry out rampant provocations and sabotage activities. They shouted anti-China slogans such as "Crush the People's Republic of China," "Drive out the People's Republic of China," "Hang the Chinks," "The People's Republic of China is Nekolim" (Editor's note: Nekolim is an abbreviation of the Indonesian words "neo-colonialism, old colonialism, and imperialism"), and insults to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and smeared the embassy wall with vicious and vulgar anti-China slogans such as "The People's Republic of China is the planner of the September 30th Movement," "Traitors," and "Harlot."
    The thugs climbed onto the wall of the embassy, ​​cursed wildly, and threw hundreds of stones and wooden sticks, paint cans, paint brushes, etc., at the embassy, ​​injuring one embassy staff member and damaging the roof and walls of the embassy buildings, smashing one of the embassy's cars. They also smashed the door lights and street lights on the wall of the embassy and damaged the iron fence on the side door of the embassy.
    The thugs even openly smashed the Chinese national emblem hanging on the gate of the embassy and stole the bronze plaque bearing the mark "Embassy of the People's Republic of China."
    This attack on the Chinese Embassy by these thugs lasted for one hour and twenty minutes. During the thugs' rampage, the dozens of Indonesian military police present not only stood by and did not stop them, but also waved to them and encouraged them.
    During this period, the Chinese Embassy made several telephone calls to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Police, the Mobile Police Headquarters, and other relevant departments, requesting them to take immediate measures to protect the safety of the embassy, but they never took any security measures.

    印尼右派组织暴徒袭击我使馆
    恣意破坏了我大使馆建筑物，打伤了我大使馆工作人员一名，打碎我国国徽，劫走大使馆铜牌，叫喊反华口号，涂抹反华标语。在场军警袖手旁观，并且加以鼓动。我大使馆几次打电话通知印度尼西亚外交部、警察部等有关部门，他们始终没有采取任何安全措施。
    新华社三日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派势力三日公然组织一批暴徒，野蛮地袭击中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆。这些暴徒在在场的印度尼西亚军警的纵容下，恣意破坏了大使馆建筑物，并且打伤了大使馆工作人员一名。这是迄今为止印度尼西亚右派势力有计划制造的破坏中国和印度尼西亚关系的最严重事件。
    三日中午十三时十分，自称属于“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动指挥部”的暴徒一千多人分乘卡车大约三十辆（其中有印度尼西亚武装部队的装甲车两辆）、摩托车和其它车辆二十多辆，到中国大使馆门前进行猖狂的挑衅和破坏活动。他们叫喊：“粉碎中华人民共和国”、“赶走中华人民共和国”、“吊死支那人”、“中华人民共和国是尼哥林（编者按：尼哥林是印度尼西亚文“新老殖民主义和帝国主义”的缩写）”以及侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席等反华口号，并且在大使馆墙上涂抹：“中华人民共和国是九月三十日运动的策划者”、“叛逆者”、“淫妇”等恶毒下流的反华标语。
    暴徒们爬上大使馆的墙头，大肆叫骂，并且向大使馆投掷了几百块石头和木棍、油漆筒、油刷等物，打伤了大使馆一名工作人员，打坏了使馆建筑物的房顶和墙壁，砸坏了使馆的一辆汽车。他们还打碎了使馆的门灯和墙上的路灯，破坏了使馆边门上的铁栅网。
    暴徒们甚至公然打碎悬挂在大使馆大门上的中国国徽，劫走了刻有“中华人民共和国大使馆”标志的铜牌。
    这批暴徒对中国大使馆的袭击历时一小时二十分。暴徒行凶期间，在场的数十名印度尼西亚军警非但袖手旁观，不加制止，而且对他们挥手示意，加以鼓动。
    在这段期间，中国大使馆曾经先后几次打电话通知印度尼西亚外交部、警察部、机动警察司令部等有关部门，要求他们立即采取措施，保护大使馆的安全，但是，他们始终没有采取任何安全措施。
