    (Xinhua News Agency, Paris) This reporter reports: The Franco-West German high-level talks, held every six months, took place here on the 7th and 8th. French newspapers generally gave the talks two comments: "The atmosphere was not bad," but "no significant results were achieved." Many newspapers added, "No one expected such results anyway."
    West German Chancellor Erhard arrived in Paris on the morning of the 7th. He held two talks with French President de Gaulle over these two days, and one talk with French Prime Minister Pompidou. The foreign, defense, and economic ministers of the two countries also held separate talks.
    No official communique was issued. According to spokesmen for both sides, the talks discussed issues such as Western European economic and political cooperation, East-West relations, the German question, the Vietnam question, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization issue. The talks showed that deep divisions between the two governments on a series of major issues still exist. However, since the two countries and the other four countries of the "Common Market" had just reached a temporary compromise at the Luxembourg Six-Nation Ministerial Meeting a few days ago, they had no intention of launching a new major confrontation immediately and felt it was necessary to slightly ease the atmosphere on the surface. Therefore, they avoided or only slightly touched on issues on which the two sides had fundamental differences and sought common ground only on some smaller, specific issues. As a French newspaper said some time ago, the Franco-West German relationship "this bottle has already cracked, and now the point is to be careful not to smash it."
    According to spokesmen for both sides, on the attitude towards the Vietnam issue, the two sides adhered to their respective viewpoints. As everyone knows, West Germany supports the United States' aggression against Vietnam and provides financial and material assistance to the South Vietnamese puppet regime, while de Gaulle does not support the US military intervention.
    On the so-called "German reunification" issue, Erhard did not receive serious support from de Gaulle.
    As for the issue of West Germany's involvement in nuclear weapons, which France firmly opposes, spokesmen said that the two sides did not discuss it at all.
    Regarding Western European economic and political "cooperation," the two sides agreed that the recent decisions of the six "Common Market" countries in Luxembourg should be "given priority." "Political cooperation" remains a "desirable goal," but "no practical and feasible solution has yet been found." In this regard, a sentence in de Gaulle's toast at a luncheon he gave for Erhard yesterday attracted people's attention. He emphasized at the time that the two sides would study some issues "in a spirit consistent with reality." Today's *Le Figaro* published a special article annotating and elaborating on de Gaulle's statement. The article called this sentence "a new color in the relationship between Paris and Bonn."
    It is reported that it was in this spirit of "small steps" that the two sides discussed the issue of "political cooperation" among the six countries of "Little Europe" again in the talks and reached an agreement that this "cooperation" "should receive new impetus." As everyone knows, "political cooperation" is an issue that has been discussed for many years among the six countries without any progress. When France is active on this issue, West Germany is passive, and when West Germany is active, France is passive. In January last year, in order to seize this banner before the general election, Erhard urged de Gaulle to reluctantly agree to convene a six-nation foreign ministers' meeting to promote "political cooperation" during the Rambouillet talks. However, France quickly changed its mind later. After the "Common Market" crisis broke out, this issue was even more highly shelved. This meeting rehashed the old story, but did not even reaffirm the need to convene a foreign ministers' meeting, but only reached an agreement on an empty statement. *Le Figaro* wrote: "It is difficult to say that it is a reconstruction (of political cooperation) because it seems that no concrete plan has been derived from this exchange of views. More precisely, the idea of a political alliance has been hung up again, to be seriously discussed at a better moment in the future."

### 法国西德会谈结束矛盾依旧  双方回避了核武器问题只就“政治合作”取得表面协议  巴黎报纸说会谈只不过在两国裂痕上涂了一层“新色彩”

    法国西德会谈结束矛盾依旧
    双方回避了核武器问题只就“政治合作”取得表面协议
    巴黎报纸说会谈只不过在两国裂痕上涂了一层“新色彩”
    据新华社巴黎电　本社记者报道：每半年举行一次的法国—西德最高级会谈，七日和八日在这里举行。法国报纸普遍对这次会谈给予两句评语：“气氛还不错”，但是“没有达成什么可观的结果”。不少报纸还要加上一句：“本来谁也没有期望能达成这样的结果”。
    西德总理艾哈德是七日上午来到巴黎的。他同法国总统戴高乐在这两天中会谈了两次，同法国总理蓬皮杜会谈了一次。两国外交、国防、经济等部长也分别举行了会谈。
    官方没有发表会谈公报。据双方发言人向记者透露，会谈中讨论了西欧经济和政治合作问题、东西方关系、德国问题、越南问题和北大西洋集团问题等。会谈情况表明，两国政府在一系列重大问题上的深刻分歧仍然存在。但是，由于两国和“共同市场”其他四国几天前刚在卢森堡六国部长会议上取得暂时妥协，无意马上展开新的大交锋，而且认为有在表面上稍稍缓和一下气氛的必要，所以避开或者只是略微触及双方有根本意见分歧的问题，只在一些较小的具体问题上寻求共同点。就象前些日子一家法国报纸所说的那样，法国—西德关系“这只瓶子已经裂开了，现在要小心的是：不要把它砸烂”。
    据双方发言人说，在对待越南问题的态度上，双方坚持各自的观点。大家知道，西德支持美国侵略越南，并且给南越傀儡政权以财政、物质援助，戴高乐则不支持美国的军事干涉。
    在所谓“德国重新统一”问题上，艾哈德并没有得到戴高乐的认真支持。
    至于法国所坚决反对的西德染指核武器问题，据发言人说，双方根本没有讨论。
    关于西欧的经济和政治“合作”，双方同意应该“优先实行”最近“共同市场”六国在卢森堡的决定。“政治合作”仍然是一个“可取的目标”，但是“目前还找不到切实可行的办法”。在这方面，戴高乐昨天中午宴请艾哈德时祝酒词中的一句话引起了人们的注意。他当时强调，双方将“以符合实际的精神”来研究一些问题。今天的《费加罗报》专门发表一篇文章，对戴高乐这句话加以注解和发挥。文章把这句话称为“巴黎、波恩间关系的新色彩”。
    据报道，正是在这种“小步走”的精神下，双方在会谈中又一次讨论了“小欧洲”六国的“政治合作”问题，并且取得协议，认为这一“合作”“应该得到新的推动”。大家知道，“政治合作”是六国之间讨论多年而毫无进展的问题。当法国对这问题积极时，西德就消极，而西德积极时，法国又消极。去年一月艾哈德为了在大选前抓这面旗帜曾在郎布依埃会谈中促使戴高乐勉强同意召开六国外长会议来推进“政治合作”。但法国后来很快变了主意。在“共同市场”危机爆发后，这一问题更是高高挂起了。这次会谈旧事重提，却甚至没有重新肯定要召开外长会议，而只是就一句空话取得协议。《费加罗报》写道：“很难说得上是（政治合作）的重建，因为看来在这次意见交换中，并没有得出任何具体方案。更正确地说，政治联盟的主张又挂起来了，要留待今后更好的时刻去认真讨论。”
