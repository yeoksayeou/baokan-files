    Regarding the Serious Incident of Indonesian Right-Wing Forces Organizing Mobs to Attack Our Consulate in Banjarmasin
    I Lodge the Strongest Protest to the Indonesian Government
    In a note, the Chinese Embassy pointed out: This wave of anti-China provocations, one after another, shows that the Indonesian government disregards the Chinese government's repeated strong protests and solemn demands, and has not fulfilled its promise to prevent such incidents from happening again. The Chinese Embassy expresses its utmost indignation at this and demands that the Indonesian government make a public apology, severely punish the perpetrators and instigators, and compensate for all losses.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 16th. The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia delivered a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on February 15th, lodging the strongest protest to the Indonesian government regarding the serious incident of Indonesian right-wing forces organizing mobs to attack the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Banjarmasin and destroying Chinese shops and residences. The full text of the note is as follows:
    To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia:
    The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia extends its greetings to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, and makes the following representations regarding the serious incident of Indonesian right-wing forces organizing mobs to attack the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Banjarmasin:
    On February 10, 1966, hundreds of rioters calling themselves the "Indonesian University Students United Action Organization" launched a frenzied attack on the Chinese Consulate General in Banjarmasin, violently striking the consulate building with stones and wooden sticks, smashing the windows of the offices, while shouting anti-China slogans such as "Crush the People's Republic of China," "Crush the Chinese Consulate," and "Down with the Chinks." Some rioters even climbed over the walls and rushed into the inner courtyard of the consulate to make trouble and provoke. This atrocity began at 11:35 a.m. and lasted for as long as 65 minutes. That same afternoon, this group of rioters also damaged Chinese shops and residences in Banjarmasin.
    On February 12th, Chinese shops and residences in Banjarmasin, and the Chinese General Association of Banjarmasin were again severely damaged by rioters. On the same day, when Su Sheng, the Chinese Consul in Banjarmasin, met with the Governor of South Kalimantan Province, the car he was riding in was daubed with anti-China slogans in the courtyard of the governor's residence: "Crush the People's Republic of China," "Drive the People's Republic of China out of Indonesia," and "No to the People's Republic of China."
    It must be pointed out that the day before the incident began, the Chinese Consul had met with the Governor of South Kalimantan and requested the authorities to take effective measures to ensure the safety of the Consulate General and its personnel, and to protect the legitimate rights and the safety of life and property of local overseas Chinese. However, the atrocities still occurred, and escalated, and the rioters even unscrupulously carried out anti-China provocations against the Chinese Consul in the governor's residence! These facts show that the relevant authorities in Banjarmasin did not pay attention to the solemn request made by the Chinese Consul, and even more did not take effective measures to ensure the safety of the Chinese Consulate General and the overseas Chinese. This cannot but be deeply regretted!
    Looking back over the past four months or more, the atrocities of the rioters organized by the Indonesian right-wing forces, arbitrarily creating incidents that have deteriorated the relations between China and Indonesia, and arbitrarily trampling on the norms of international law and international practice, have occurred one after another, resulting in the repeated and brutal violation of the privileges of Chinese diplomatic missions. Only seven days after the recent attack and destruction of the Chinese Embassy, there was another atrocity against the Chinese Consulate General and overseas Chinese in Banjarmasin, which is even more serious in nature. This wave of anti-China provocations, one after another, shows that the Indonesian government disregards the Chinese government's repeated strong protests and solemn demands, has not fulfilled its promise to prevent such incidents from happening again, and has not guaranteed the safety of Chinese diplomatic missions.
    The Chinese Embassy expresses its utmost indignation at the above-mentioned serious incident, lodges the strongest protest to the Indonesian government, and demands that the Indonesian government make a public apology for the above-mentioned incident, severely punish the perpetrators and instigators, compensate for all losses suffered by the Consulate General and the overseas Chinese, earnestly fulfill its responsibility to protect the safety of Chinese diplomatic missions and their personnel, guarantee the diplomatic privileges enjoyed by Chinese diplomatic missions and their personnel, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.
    The Chinese Embassy is currently limited by various conditions and has not been able to fully understand the detailed situation of the damage suffered by the Banjarmasin Consulate General and the Banjarmasin Overseas Chinese. Therefore, it reserves the right to make further demands.
    With highest respect.

    就印尼右派势力组织暴徒袭击我马辰领事馆的严重事件
    我向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈抗议
    中国大使馆在照会中指出：这种一波未平一波又起的反华挑衅，表明印度尼西亚政府无视中国政府一再提出的强烈抗议和严正要求，没有履行其保证不再发生这类事件的诺言。中国大使馆对此表示极大的愤慨，要求印度尼西亚政府公开道歉，切实惩办肇事者和主使人，赔偿一切损失。
    新华社十六日讯　中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆二月十五日把一份照会交给印度尼西亚外交部，就印度尼西亚右派势力组织暴徒袭击中华人民共和国驻马辰领事馆和对华侨商店和住宅进行破坏的严重事件，向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。照会全文如下：印度尼西亚共和国外交部：
    中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆向印度尼西亚共和国外交部致意，并就印度尼西亚右派势力组织的暴徒袭击中华人民共和国驻马辰领事馆的严重事件，申述如下：
    一九六六年二月十日，有数百名自称为“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”的暴徒，对中国驻马辰领事馆进行了猖狂的袭击，用石块、木棍猛击领事馆的建筑物，打破了办公室的玻璃窗，同时还喊叫什么“粉碎中华人民共和国”、“粉碎中国领事馆”、“打倒支那人”等反华口号。有的暴徒竟翻越围墙，冲入领事馆的内院，进行捣乱挑衅。此次暴行从上午十一时三十五分开始，历时竟达六十五分钟之久。同日下午，这批暴徒还对马辰市的华侨商店和住宅进行了破坏。
    二月十二日，马辰市的华侨商店和住宅、马辰的中华总会又遭到暴徒的严重破坏。同日，中国驻马辰的苏生领事在会见南加里曼丹省长之际，他所乘坐的汽车，竟在省长官邸的院子内，被暴徒涂写上了反华标语：“粉碎中华人民共和国”、“把中华人民共和国从印度尼西亚赶出去”、“不要中华人民共和国”。
    必须指出，在事件开始发生的前一天，中国领事曾会见了南加里曼丹的省长，要求当局采取切实有效的措施，保障领事馆及人员的安全，保护当地华侨的正当权益和生命财产的安全。但是，暴行事件仍然发生了，而且愈演愈烈，暴徒竟肆无忌惮的在省长官邸内对中国领事进行反华挑衅！这些事实表明，马辰有关当局在中国领事提出郑重的要求之后，并没有加以重视，更没有采取有效的措施，确保中国领事馆和侨民的安全，这不能不令人感到莫大的遗憾！
    回顾四个多月以来，印度尼西亚右派势力组织的暴徒，恣意制造恶化中国、印度尼西亚两国关系的事件，任意践踏国际法准则和国际惯例的暴行，竟接连出现，致使中国外交代表机构的特权一再遭到粗暴侵犯，最近对中国大使馆进行了袭击破坏之后，仅隔七天，又发生了对中国驻马辰领事馆和侨民的暴行，其性质是更加严重的。这种一波未平一波又起的反华挑衅，就表明了印度尼西亚政府无视中国政府一再提出的强烈抗议和严正要求，没有履行其保证不再发生这类事件的诺言，也没有保障中国外交代表机构的安全。
    中国大使馆对上述严重事件表示极大的愤慨，特向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议，并要求印度尼西亚政府对上述事件公开道歉，切实惩办肇事者和主使人，赔偿领事馆和华侨所受到的一切损失，切实履行保护中国外交代表机构及其人员安全的责任，保障中国外交代表机构及其人员应享有的外交特权，并保证不再发生类似事件。
    中国大使馆目前受到各种条件的限制，未能完全了解马辰领事馆和马辰华侨受到破坏的详细情况，为此，保留进一步提出要求的权利。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
