    Xinhua News Agency, 31st – Saigon Dispatch: The South Vietnam Liberation Army on the 31st continued to fiercely attack American invading troops and South Korean mercenary troops in the Phu Son, Tuy Hoa, and Nha Trang areas of the central coast of South Vietnam, as well as near Saigon, inflicting heavy casualties and losses on the enemy.
    According to Western news agencies, the Liberation Army launched a fierce attack on the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division near Phu Son again on the morning of the 31st. This is the third day that the Liberation Army has fiercely attacked the American invading troops here. Reports said that the Liberation Army's heavy mortars and automatic weapons rained down on U.S. troops 16 kilometers north of Phu Son for an hour, pounding one U.S. battalion into disarray and chaos.
    Thirty-two kilometers southwest of Tuy Hoa, the Liberation Army simultaneously attacked a battalion of South Korean mercenary troops from three sides on the 31st. These mercenary troops were preparing to go out for a "sweep," but were instead ambushed by the Liberation Army. In nearly five hours of attack, enemy troops suffered heavy casualties.
    On the 31st, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and a group of South Korean puppet troops operating near Nha Trang were also repeatedly attacked by Liberation Army snipers.
    Before dawn on the 31st, the Liberation Army bombarded a U.S. 1st Infantry Division artillery camp near Saigon with mortars. This artillery camp was only five kilometers from the 1st Infantry Division headquarters located about 20 kilometers northwest of Saigon. According to reports, the fierce shelling lasted for about 25 minutes, causing casualties to the U.S. troops and destroying several helicopters.
    On the 29th and 30th, the Liberation Army also continuously bombarded the camp of the 2nd Battalion, 27th Regiment of the U.S. Army 25th Division near Cu Chi, northwest of Saigon, with mortar fire.
    Xinhua News Agency, 31st – While the U.S. Johnson administration resumed its barbaric bombing of North Vietnam, it brazenly launched a five-pronged offensive in the 160-kilometer area along Highway 1 on the coast of South Vietnam.
    According to Western news agencies, in this long-planned and frenzied offensive, the American invaders dispatched 40,000 combat troops, including Marines, paratroopers, and infantry, and deployed a large number of aircraft and ships for support. According to United Press International, on the 29th alone, U.S. aircraft carried out 287 sorties in the aforementioned area, and five ships belonging to the U.S. Seventh Fleet bombarded the coast.
    The news said that the so-called "Double Eagle Offensive" began on the 28th in the coastal area of Quang Ngai province. American invaders landed more than 5,000 Marines there. United Press International called it "the largest amphibious landing since the Korean War." The so-called "Pile Driver Offensive" was launched by the U.S. 1st Infantry Division on the 28th, more than 30 kilometers southeast of Saigon. Another unit of this division launched the so-called "Cedar Falls Offensive" about 50 kilometers northwest of Saigon. The U.S. 101st Airborne Division launched the "Van Buren Offensive" in Phu Yen province. The 1st Cavalry Division launched the "Masher Offensive" north of Phu Son in the central plains.
    These actions by the United States to expand the war of aggression were carefully prepared during the month it launched a "peace offensive." It further proves that the large amount of "peace" smoke released by the Johnson administration these days is precisely to cover up its large-scale expansion of the war of aggression. But no matter how the American invaders struggle, they cannot save their doomed defeat. The American invaders' "offensive" was met head-on by the army and people of South Vietnam from the very beginning.
    According to the Associated Press, in the "Masher Offensive" launched by the U.S. 1st Air Cavalry Division in the Phu Son area of the central plains, their helicopters were fiercely attacked by the Liberation Army as soon as they landed, "and later, they were heavily fired upon while crossing the rice paddies." The American side itself admitted that this unit suffered so-called "moderate" casualties. The American invading troops who landed in the Quang Ngai area initially could not find the Liberation Army, but were later ambushed by the Liberation Army, suffering heavy casualties.

    美军四万悍然在南越沿海地区发动五路进攻
    南越解放军奋勇迎击予敌重创
    神炮手在蓬山猛轰一小时把一营美军打得狼狈不堪
    新华社三十一日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放军三十一日继续痛击在南越中部沿海蓬山、绥和、芽庄地区，以及在西贡附近的美国侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军，使敌人遭到巨大伤亡和损失。
    据西方通讯社报道，解放军三十一日上午又向蓬山附近的美国第一骑兵师发动了猛烈进攻。这是解放军第三天在这里狠打美国侵略军。报道说，解放军的重迫击炮和自动武器的炮火暴风骤雨般地向蓬山以北十六公里地方的美军轰击，轰击达一小时之久，一营美军被打得狼狈不堪，一片混乱。
    在绥和西南三十二公里地方，解放军在三十一日从三面同时进攻一个营的南朝鲜帮凶军。这批帮凶军正在准备出去进行“扫荡”，但是正在这时却受到了解放军的围攻。在将近五小时的进攻中，敌军伤亡累累。
    三十一日，在芽庄附近活动的美国第一○一空降师部队和一批南朝鲜仆从军，也连连遭到解放军狙击手炮火的袭击。
    解放军三十一日黎明前用迫击炮轰击了西贡附近的美国第一步兵师的炮兵营地，这个炮兵营地距离设在西贡西北约二十公里地方的第一步兵师总部只有五公里。据报道，猛烈的炮火持续了约二十五分钟，使美军遭到了伤亡，并有好几架直升飞机被击毁。
    在二十九日和三十日，解放军还用迫击炮火连续轰击了西贡西北古芝附近的美国陆军第二十五师第二十七团的营地。
    新华社三十一日讯　美国约翰逊政府在恢复对越南北方的野蛮轰炸的同时，在越南南方沿海沿一号公路的一百六十多公里地区悍然发动五路进攻。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国侵略者在这次蓄谋已久的猖狂进攻中，出动了包括海军陆战队、伞兵和步兵等四万名战斗部队，并且出动了大批飞机和舰艇进行配合。据合众国际社报道，仅二十九日一天，美机就对上述地区出击了二百八十七架次，五艘属于美国第七舰队的舰艇在沿海轰击。
    消息说，美国的所谓“双鹰攻势”是二十八日在广义省沿海地区开始的。美国侵略者出动了五千多名海军陆战队在那里登陆。合众国际社称之为，“朝鲜战争以来规模最大的两栖登陆”。所谓“木槌攻势”是美国第一步兵师二十八日在西贡东南三十多公里的地方发动的。这个师的另一支部队在西贡西北约五十公里的地方发动了所谓“鹿皮攻势”。美军第一○一空降师在富安省发动了“范布伦攻势”。第一骑兵师在中部平原蓬山以北发动了“捣碎机攻势”。
    美国的这些扩大侵略战争的行动，是它在发动“和平攻势”的一个多月期间进行了周密准备的。它进一步证明，约翰逊政府这些日子放出的大量的“和平”烟幕，恰恰是为了掩盖它大规模地扩大侵略战争。但是美国侵略者怎样挣扎也挽救不了它输定了的败局。美国侵略者的“攻势”一开始就遭到越南南方军民的迎头痛击。
    据美联社透露，美国第一空中骑兵师在中部平原蓬山地区展开的“捣碎机攻势”中，它们的直升飞机刚刚着陆，就遭到解放军的猛烈袭击，“后来在越过水田时又遭到猛烈的射击”，美国方面自己也承认，这支部队受到所谓“中等程度”的伤亡。在广义地区登陆的美国侵略军开始是找不到解放军，后来却被解放军伺机猛袭，遭到大量杀伤。
