    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 2nd (Dispatch) – According to newspapers here on the 2nd, Choe Yong-gon, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, sent a reply to President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the 1st, expressing full support for the position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and resolutely condemning the U.S. imperialists' plot to further expand the war of aggression against the Vietnamese people and the barbarous act of resuming bombing of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    Chairman Choe Yong-gon's reply was adopted at an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea on February 1st. Chairman Choe Yong-gon's reply stated that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people fully support the position of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The reply pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' aggression against the Vietnamese people has met with strong resistance from the entire Vietnamese people and has been unanimously condemned by the people of socialist countries, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all peace-loving people in the world.
    The reply said, "The Vietnamese people's nationwide anti-American struggle for national salvation to defend the North, liberate the South, and achieve the peaceful reunification of the country is making a great contribution to the struggle of the people of the world for peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism, and is infinitely inspiring them. All peace-loving people in the world unanimously support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and express their militant solidarity with them."
    The reply pointed out that in order to salvage its defeat in the war of aggression against Vietnam and to find an excuse to further expand the war, U.S. imperialism has trotted out the "peace offensive" fraud. However, no matter what "peace" mask U.S. imperialism uses, it cannot conceal its aggressive nature. The U.S. imperialist aggressor troops have resumed the barbaric bombing of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. All kinds of facts clearly prove that the "peace" activities of U.S. imperialism are merely a deceptive means to cover up its expansion of aggression and war in Vietnam and Indochina. The reply said that U.S. imperialism must immediately stop all aggression and war activities in Vietnam and immediately withdraw the U.S. aggressor troops, the troops of its vassal states, military personnel, and all types of weapons from South Vietnam. The peaceful reunification of Vietnam must be resolved by the entire people of North and South Vietnam themselves without any foreign interference.
    If U.S. imperialism does not learn the lessons it deserves from its disastrous defeat and continues to pursue a policy of expanding the war, it will further expose its aggressive nature to the people of the world and end up digging a grave for itself. The U.S. imperialists will be destroyed, and the Vietnamese people fighting for the cause of justice will surely win victory.
    The reply concluded by saying that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people will, as always, continue to do everything in their power to actively support the fraternal Vietnamese people who are fighting against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and for the freedom and independence of their motherland. The Korean people will fight resolutely to the end alongside the Vietnamese people against the U.S. imperialist aggressors.

    崔庸健委员长复函胡志明主席
    完全支持越南人民粉碎美帝扩大战争阴谋
    新华社平壤二日电　据这里报纸二日报道，朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健一日复信给越南民主共和国主席胡志明，表示完全支持越南民主共和国的立场，坚决谴责美帝国主义企图进一步扩大反对越南人民的侵略战争的阴谋和对越南民主共和国领土恢复轰炸的野蛮行为。
    崔庸健委员长的复信是在朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会二月一日举行的扩大会议上通过的。崔庸健委员长的复信说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民完全支持越南民主共和国政府的立场。
    复信指出，美帝国主义对越南人民的侵略遭到了全体越南人民强有力的抵抗，受到社会主义阵营各国人民、亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民的一致谴责。
    复信说，“越南人民为保卫北方、解放南方和实现国家和平统一的全民的反美救国斗争，正在为全世界人民争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义的斗争做出巨大贡献，并且无限地鼓舞着他们。全世界所有爱好和平人民一致支持越南人民的正义斗争，并且向他们表示战斗的声援。”
    复信指出，美帝国主义为了挽救它在侵越战争中遭到的失败和为了寻找进一步扩大战争的借口，搬出了“和平攻势”的骗局。但是，不管美帝国主义运用什么“和平”的假面具，都掩盖不了它的侵略本质。美帝国主义侵略军已经恢复了对越南民主共和国领土的野蛮轰炸。各种事实都清楚地证明，美帝国主义的“和平”活动，只不过是用来掩盖它在越南和印度支那扩大侵略和战争的一种欺骗手段。复信说，美帝国主义必须立即在越南停止一切侵略和战争活动，并且马上把美国侵略军、它的附属国的军队、军事人员和一切类型的武器从越南南方撤走。越南的重新和平统一，必须在没有任何外来势力干涉的情况下，由全体越南北方和越南南方人民自己来解决。
    如果美帝国主义不从已遭到的惨败中吸取应得的教训，反而继续追求扩大战争的政策，那么，它必将在全世界人民面前进一步暴露出自己的侵略本质，落得一个替自己挖掘坟墓的结果。美帝国主义者必将遭到灭亡，为正义事业而战的越南人民必将取得胜利。
    复信最后说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民将一如既往，继续竭尽一切力量，积极支援为反对美帝国主义的侵略、为争取祖国自由和独立而战的兄弟的越南人民。朝鲜人民将同越南人民一道，为反对美帝国主义侵略者坚决斗争到底。
