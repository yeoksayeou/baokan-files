    Hanoi, February 15 (Xinhua) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Binh Dinh Province inflicted heavy blows on the enemy during their fight against the large-scale "sweep" by U.S., puppet, and South Korean mercenary troops from January 28 to February 4. Preliminary statistics indicate that nearly 1,500 enemy troops were annihilated, most of whom were from the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division; over 80 enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed, and over 70 were damaged; many armored vehicles and military vehicles were destroyed, and a large quantity of military supplies were captured.

    On January 28, the American aggressors and puppet troops launched a large-scale "sweep" called "Operation Masher" towards the north of Phu Cat in Binh Dinh Province, vainly attempting to clear Route 1 from Qui Nhon to Sa Huynh, which had been cut off by the southern army and people for a year, and plotting to seize the liberated areas. In this "sweep," the enemy deployed a total of twenty battalions, including nearly 10,000 troops from the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, the 40th and 41st regiments and a paratrooper battle group of the puppet army, and multiple battalions of South Korean mercenary troops, as well as hundreds of aircraft and M-113 amphibious armored vehicles.

    On the morning of January 28, the puppet paratroopers and various South Korean mercenary troops conducted a "sweep" along both sides of Route 1, covering the attacking American troops. Local guerrillas intercepted the enemy three times on the seven-kilometer-long road extending north from Phu Cat, annihilating over 100 enemy troops south of the Phu Ly Bridge in Khanh Phu village, Cat Trinh commune. Subsequently, the enemy divided its forces into three routes to attack Cat Trinh. The first route advanced towards Cat Trinh from Phu Cat; the second route landed via helicopters in the area five kilometers north of Tam Quan and in Gia Huu area; and the third route landed via helicopters in the southwest of Tam Quan and in Cat Trinh.

    Fifteen helicopters had just transported troops to land in Cat Trinh when they were immediately intercepted by the Liberation Armed Forces and almost completely wiped out. The other three battalions of U.S. puppet troops, relying on heavy bombing from aircraft and artillery, launched multiple attacks on the Cat Trinh area, vainly attempting to relieve their accomplices. With an incomparably strong and ingenious fighting spirit, the Liberation Armed Forces not only defended their positions but also repelled and routed three enemy attacks. The Liberation Armed Forces annihilated over 300 enemy troops here, almost completely wiping out a battalion of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division; shot down eight helicopters, and damaged sixteen.

    From January 29 to 31, large numbers of troops from the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division and South Korean mercenary troops continuously "swept" the hilly areas northwest of Tam Quan, north of Phu Cat, and west of Sa Huynh, and were similarly beaten to a pulp by the guerrillas, losing over 500 troops and having four helicopters shot down.

    After suffering a disastrous defeat, the enemy used a large number of aircraft to transport reinforcements. The Liberation Armed Forces were determined to give the enemy no respite, launching continuous day and night offensives against them. On February 2, guerrillas attacked the South Korean mercenary troops stationed in Phu My, annihilating over 100 enemy troops, and destroyed thirteen helicopters and damaged six in Phu Ly and Hoai Hai. On the same day, guerrillas also shot down and destroyed thirty-three American aircraft around Phu Cat. That same night, the Liberation Armed Forces also attacked the Phu Giai airfield where helicopters were concentrated, destroying twenty-eight aircraft and damaging nearly fifty.

    In the two days of February 3 and 4, the Liberation Armed Forces and guerrillas sometimes launched attacks and sometimes used mortars to bombard various enemy positions along Route 1, causing huge losses to the enemy.

    Currently, the fighting in the Phu Cat area is still going on fiercely.

    Washington, February 15 (Xinhua) – The American "Washington Post" revealed the embarrassing defeat of the U.S. invading forces in the recent large-scale "Operation Masher" in Binh Dinh Province in an article on February 10. Excerpts are as follows: "A senior American military officer said dispiritedly last night: 'I don't know how to come up with a way to find their hiding places.'"
      "Once they disperse, chasing them is like an elephant chasing rabbits."
      "Officials describe Allied casualties as light to moderate, but officials privately say: 'You and I both know the price is not light.'"
      "However, people doubt whether the enemy's main force has been found."
      "One thing that not everyone knows is that there were four special forces squads, each with six people, who entered a most treacherous terrain. They fought for four days, engaged in hand-to-hand combat, resulting in seven people being killed and seven injured." (Picture attached)

    南越军民铁拳捣碎美军“捣碎机攻势”
    八天歼敌一千五百人毁伤敌机百余架
    新华社河内十五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，平定省解放武装力量从一月二十八日到二月四日，在反击美、伪军和南朝鲜仆从军大规模“扫荡”战斗中，给敌人以沉重打击，据初步统计歼敌近一千五百名，其中大部分是美国第一骑兵师的侵略军；击落和击毁敌机八十多架，击伤七十多架；炸毁许多装甲车和军车，缴获大量军用物资。
    美国侵略者和伪军一月二十八日向平定省蓬山北部发动了名叫“捣碎机攻势”的大规模“扫荡”，妄图打通被南方军民切断一年的从归仁到沙萤的第一号公路，并且阴谋攻占解放区。在这次“扫荡”中，敌人出动了共二十个营的兵力，其中包括美国第一骑兵师的近一万名军队，伪军的第四十和四十一两个团和一个伞兵战团，南朝鲜仆从军多营，还出动了成百架飞机和M—113两栖装甲车。
    二十八日早晨，伪军伞兵和南朝鲜仆从军的各路军队沿第一号公路两侧进行“扫荡”，掩护进攻的美军。当地游击队在从蓬山向北面伸延的长达七公里的公路上三次截击敌人，在吉兴乡庆福村符理桥以南的地方歼敌一百多名。在这以后，敌人又分兵三路向左吉进攻，第一路从蓬山向左吉进发，第二路从海上用直升飞机在离三关北部五公里的地区和嘉佑地区登陆，第三路用直升飞机在三关西南地区和左吉着陆。
    十五架直升飞机刚刚把军队运到左吉着陆，就立即遭到解放武装力量的阻击，几乎全部被消灭干净。美伪军的另外三个营依靠飞机大炮的狂轰滥炸，向左吉地区发起多次进攻，妄图为它们的同伙解困。解放武装力量的战士们，以无比坚强和机智的战斗精神，不仅守住了阵地，还打退并击溃了敌人的三次进攻。解放武装力量在这里歼灭了三百多名敌人，其中几乎全歼美国第一骑兵师的一个营；击落直升飞机八架，击伤十六架。
    从一月二十九日到三十一日，美国第一骑兵师的大批军队和南朝鲜仆从军接连向三关西北部、蓬山北部、沙萤西部的山丘地区进行“扫荡”，同样被游击队打得落花流水，被歼五百多名，并被击落直升飞机四架。
    敌人遭到惨败后，又使用大批飞机运来援军，解放武装力量决心使敌人无法喘息，向敌人展开了日夜不停的连续进攻。二月二日，游击队袭击了驻在符美的南朝鲜仆从军，歼敌一百多名，在符理和怀会击毁直升飞机十三架，击伤六架。同一天，游击队还在蓬山周围击落击毁美国飞机三十三架。当天晚上，解放武装力量还袭击集中停放直升飞机的符吉飞机场，炸毁飞机二十八架，炸坏近五十架。
    在二月三日和四日两天中，解放武装力量和游击队对在第一号公路上的敌人各个驻地时而进行袭击，时而用迫击炮轰击，给敌人造成巨大损失。
    目前，蓬山地区的战斗仍在激烈进行。
    新华社十五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国《华盛顿邮报》二月十日在一篇文章中透露了侵越美军最近在平定省发动大规模“捣碎机攻势”遭到失败的狼狈相，摘要如下：“一个美国高级军官昨晚丧气地说：‘我不知道怎样才能搞出一套发现他们的隐藏处的办法。’”
      “一旦他们散开，你要追他们，简直就象大象追兔子一样。”
      “官方把盟军的伤亡说成是轻微到中等程度，但是官员们私下说：‘你我都知道代价不轻’”。
      “但是，人们怀疑敌人的主力部队是否已经给找到了。”
      “有一件事并不是大家都知道的，有四个特种部队小队，每队六人，曾进入了一个最险恶的地形。他们打了四天，进行了肉搏战，结果有七人被打死，七人受伤。”（附图片）
