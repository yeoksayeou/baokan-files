　　A Valuable Experience
    The Anshan Iron and Steel Company, in its revolutionary enterprise management, created a new experience in financial work, including comprehensive mobile service teams, economic activity analysis work teams, on-site service personnel, and worker economic accounting staff. Its basic spirit is to make financial work better serve the grassroots of the enterprise. This is a valuable experience.
    The value of this experience lies in its leadership under Mao Zedong Thought, highlighting politics, with politics commanding professional work, so that financial work faces the grassroots, faces the masses, and serves production.
    The value of this experience lies in enabling financial workers to delve into the front lines, conduct investigations and research, and effectively solve key problems in production, achieving more with less money.
    The value of this experience lies in its organic combination of division of labor and integration, service and supervision, professional management and mass management.
    The value of this experience also lies in its mobilization of the worker masses to participate in management, improving the workers' enthusiasm and awareness in managing finances for the household, and at the same time, promoting the ideological revolutionization of office personnel and the revolutionization of financial work.
    Of course, Anshan Iron and Steel Company's experience is still preliminary, and it needs to be further improved and perfected in practice. However, as can be seen from the articles published in this edition today, this is a new path for the revolutionization of financial work.

　　一个可贵的经验
    鞍山钢铁公司在企业管理革命化中，创造了一个财务工作的新经验，其中包括综合巡回服务组、经济活动分析工作队、现场服务员、工人经济核算员等。它的基本精神，是使财务工作更好地为企业的基层服务。这是一个可贵的经验。
    这个经验的可贵之处，在于它以毛泽东思想挂帅，突出政治，政治统帅业务，使财务工作面向基层，面向群众，为生产服务。
    这个经验的可贵之处，在于它使财务工作者深入现场，调查研究，切实地解决生产中的关键问题，做到少花钱，多办事。
    这个经验的可贵之处，在于它把分工与综合、服务与监督、专业管理与群众管理有机地结合起来了。
    这个经验的可贵之处，还在于它发动了工人群众参加管理，提高了工人当家理财的积极性和自觉性，同时，又促进了科室人员的思想革命化和财务工作的革命化。
    当然，鞍山钢铁公司的这个经验还是初步的，它还需要在实践中进一步提高和完善。但是，从今天本版发表的几篇文章中可以看出，这是财务工作革命化的新路子。
