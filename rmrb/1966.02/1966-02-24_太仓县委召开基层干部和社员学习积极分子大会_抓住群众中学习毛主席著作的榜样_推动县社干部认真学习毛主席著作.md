　　According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 23rd: The Taicang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Jiangsu Province has adopted the method of "grasping the masses and promoting the leaders (leading cadres)" to promote the study of Chairman Mao's works by county and commune cadres, achieving significant results.
　　The movement of cadres and the masses in Taicang County to study Chairman Mao's works has developed with the gradual deepening of the Socialist Education Movement. Now, more and more people are participating in the study. Cadres and peasants, young people and old people, the literate and the illiterate, many people are studying. Gu Atao, a poor peasant woman of the Hongjing Brigade of the Shaxi Commune, said: "Lack of education cannot defeat my determination. I have ears to listen, a mouth to ask, and a brain to think." In this way, this old woman, who "doesn't know a bushel of characters," has already studied several of Chairman Mao's articles, understood many revolutionary principles, transformed many old ideas, and done many good things for the collective. Cadres and members of the Beijiao Brigade of the Dongjiao Commune have adopted the "four littles" method when studying Chairman Mao's works, namely: study a little less, explain a little more vividly, remember a little more firmly, and use a little better. Recently, they have further emphasized "four couplings (combinations)" in the word "use," that is: conscious study and conscious use are coupled, what to do and what to study are coupled, learning viewpoints and learning from role models are coupled, and seeing the big picture and starting with small details are coupled. As a result, the more they learn, the more active the political atmosphere becomes.
　　Some leading cadres in Taicang County have fallen behind the masses in studying Chairman Mao's works. The main reason is that they have not correctly positioned politics and work. They verbally agree with politics first, but in reality, they still put work first. When meetings are held, they also talk about highlighting politics, but there is no specific content. Secondly, some leading cadres lack a conscious revolutionary spirit and often use the excuse of being busy with work to not study seriously. Some believe that the Party's policies and instructions are formulated based on Mao Zedong Thought, and it is enough to study them well, without realizing that Chairman Mao's books are the highest instructions for all work. Therefore, the Taicang County Committee recently convened a meeting of activists in the county to study Chairman Mao's works to exchange experiences and establish living role models to promote the study of leading cadres at the county and commune levels.
　　The main leading cadres of Taicang County and communes and the secretaries of the brigade Party branches attended the meeting and listened carefully to the speeches of the commune members, work point recorders, educated youth participating in agricultural production, teachers of the farming-study primary schools, and basic-level cadres. These activists were filled with deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's books. Their speeches were simple and practical. Many cadres were deeply moved after listening and deeply realized that if they did not work hard to study, they would fall behind. Some leading cadres who usually studied relatively well felt that they were still far behind the poor and lower-middle peasants. Leading cadres who usually did not study well felt that they no longer had any excuses for not studying hard.
　　Through this meeting, everyone established confidence in further highlighting politics, grasping the study of Chairman Mao's works, and doing a good job in production; established confidence in taking the lead in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and setting an example; and established confidence that even if one's education is low and one's age is high, one can still study Chairman Mao's works well.
　　As soon as the meeting ended, the County Committee, within the County Committee leadership core and among the County-level office cadres, combined the study of Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds with a rectification spirit to examine the previous stage of studying Chairman Mao's works, and made a decision to strengthen the study. Zhu Jun, the Party Secretary of Fuqiao Commune, after the meeting, led all the commune cadres to the home of Qian Da, the Party Secretary of Yajiang Brigade, an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works, for a day of study, to let everyone personally feel how Qian Da persisted in studying and think about whether they should study even better than him.

　　太仓县委召开基层干部和社员学习积极分子大会
　　抓住群众中学习毛主席著作的榜样
　　推动县社干部认真学习毛主席著作
    据新华社上海二十三日电  中共江苏省太仓县委采用“抓群众、促头头（领导干部）”的办法，推动县、社干部学好毛主席著作，取得了显著效果。
    太仓县干部、群众学习毛主席著作的运动，是随着社会主义教育运动的逐步深入而发展起来的。现在，参加学习的人愈来愈多。干部和农民、青年和老年、有文化的和不识字的，许多人都在学。沙溪公社洪泾大队贫农女社员顾阿桃说：“没有文化难不倒我的决心，我有耳朵可以听，有嘴可以问，有脑子可以想。”就这样，这个“斗大字不识一升”的老年人，已经学了毛主席的好几篇文章，懂得了许多革命道理，改造了许多旧意识，为集体做了不少好事。东郊公社北郊大队的干部、社员，在学习毛主席著作的时候采取“四个一点”的办法，即是：学得少一点、讲得活一点、记得牢一点、用得好一点。最近，他们在“用”字上又强调要“四个碰头（结合）”，即自觉学和自觉用碰头、做什么和学什么碰头，学观点和学榜样碰头、大处着眼和小处着手碰头。结果越学政治空气越活跃。
    太仓县有些领导干部在学习毛主席著作上落后于群众，主要原因是他们没有摆正政治和业务的位置，口头上赞成政治第一，实际上还是业务第一；开起会来也讲要突出政治，但是没有具体内容。其次是有些领导干部缺乏自觉革命精神，往往借口工作忙，没有认真学。有的认为党的政策、指示是根据毛泽东思想制定的，学好就很好了，没有认识到毛主席的书是一切工作的最高指示。因此，太仓县委最近召开一次全县学习毛主席著作的积极分子大会，交流经验，树立活的榜样，以促进县、社领导干部的学习。
    太仓县、社两级主要领导干部和大队党支部书记列席了这次大会，认真听取了社员、记工员、参加农业生产的知识青年、耕读小学教师和基层干部的发言。这些积极分子对毛主席的书充满了深厚的阶级感情。他们的发言讲得朴素而又实在。许多干部听了触动很深，深切地认识到，自己再不努力学习，就要掉队了。有些平时学得比较好的领导干部，觉得自己比起贫下中农来，还是差得太远，平时学得不太好的领导干部，感到再也没有借口不好好学了。
    通过这次会议，大家树立了进一步突出政治、抓好学习毛主席著作和搞好生产的信心；树立了带头活学活用毛主席著作，树立榜样的信心；树立了文化虽低、年纪虽大，也能学好毛主席著作的信心。
    会议一结束，县委就在县委领导核心中，在县级机关干部中，结合学习焦裕禄的光辉事迹，用整风精神检查前一阶段学习毛主席著作的情况，并作出了加强学习的决定。浮桥公社党委书记朱俊，会后带领全体公社干部，到学习毛主席著作积极分子、鸦江大队党支部书记钱大的家里学习一天，让大家亲身感受一下，钱大是怎样坚持学习的，想一想自己是不是应该比他学得更好一些。
