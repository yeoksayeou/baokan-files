　　Heavy Snowstorm Day
    On the morning of the 21st, Lankao County was hit by winds of around force eight, with snowflakes mixed in the wind, and the temperature suddenly dropped to nine degrees below zero. At this time, cadres from various communes and brigades rushed to the homes of commune members to inquire about their well-being. Yang Shisen, the Party branch secretary of the Dafutang Brigade in Guyang Commune, came to the home of poor peasant Old Lady Nie, who had not yet gotten up. Yang Shisen asked from the crack of the door, "Old Lady, today is windy and snowy again. Are you short of food or fuel?" Old Lady Nie thought for a moment and said, "I have enough to eat, burn, and wear, but I don't have a container for water." Yang Shisen turned around and inspected the breeding room and the houses of several commune members. Then, he ran to the Dazhai Supply and Marketing Cooperative, bought a small water tank, delivered it to Old Lady Nie's house, and carried a tank of water for her. Old Lady Nie said with emotion, "You are truly a good cadre of Chairman Mao." Wu Sijing, the deputy director of Guyang Commune, came to the home of poor peasant commune member Kong Linghuan. Kong Linghuan and his wife said with emotion, "In the past, Comrade Jiao came to our house in the wind and snow to deliver food and clothing; now that Comrade Jiao has died, you have come to our house to inquire about our well-being again. The Communist Party really cares about us poor and lower-middle peasants!" Fan Yutian, the deputy secretary of the Yifeng Commune Party Committee, and Bai Baorui, the deputy director, led eight cadres to inspect the Quantou and Daizhuang Brigades. They found that many commune members had already burned through the coal they had bought. They immediately borrowed a car and hauled back six tons of coal for the commune members in one day.

　　大风雪天
    二十一日清晨，兰考县刮起八级左右的大风，风里夹着雪片，气温骤然下降到零下九度。这时，各公社和大队的干部纷纷奔赴社员家里问寒问暖。堌阳公社大付堂大队党支部书记杨世森，来到贫农聂老大娘家，聂老大娘还没有起床。杨世森从门缝里问：“大娘，今儿个又刮风，又下雪，你缺吃缺烧不？”聂老大娘想了想说：“我吃的、烧的、穿的都不缺，就是没有个盛水的物件。”杨世森转身又检查了饲养室和几户社员的房子。然后，跑到大寨供销社买了一口小水缸，送到聂老大娘屋里，并给她担了一缸水。聂老大娘感动地说：“你真是毛主席的好干部。”堌阳公社副社长吴思敬来到贫农社员孔令焕家，孔令焕夫妇两个感动地说：“以前老焦同志在风雪天来俺家送吃送穿；现在老焦同志死了，您又来俺家问寒问暖，共产党真关心俺贫农下中农！”仪封公社党委副书记范玉琠和副社长白报瑞，带领八名干部，分赴圈头和代庄两个大队检查，发现有不少社员买的煤已经烧完。他们立即借来汽车，一天给社员拉回六吨煤。（据新华社讯）
