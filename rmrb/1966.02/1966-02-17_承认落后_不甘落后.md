    Acknowledging Backwardness, Unwilling to Lag Behind
    Comparing myself with Comrade Jiao Yulu, I have fallen behind. However, I am determined to work in Minquan for the rest of my life, and I will never give up until I have completely changed the face of Minquan.
    Minquan and Lankao are neighboring counties. Minquan's natural conditions are somewhat better than Lankao's. In recent years, Minquan's production has gradually increased, but compared with Lankao, the pace seems slow. What is the reason? The masses put it well: "Villages watch villages, households watch households, commune members watch cadres, and cadres watch leaders." This sentence reveals the crux of the problem. Comparing myself with Comrade Jiao Yulu, I am far behind.
    First, emphasizing politics and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is not as good as Jiao Yulu. He was able to adhere to using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, and he was good at using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the vast number of cadres and the masses. But my study of Chairman Mao's works is not deep or thorough enough, and my transformation of my own thinking is also poor. We spend more time discussing production in meetings and less time discussing ideological construction.
    Second, the determination to change the face of Minquan is not as good as Jiao Yulu's. Faced with serious natural disasters, he had revolutionary courage and the determination to die trying to achieve his goals. But I do whatever comes my way, and I grasp whatever the higher authorities assign. I lack the lofty ambition to build a new socialist Minquan.
    Third, my revolutionary drive is not as good as Jiao Yulu's. He had only the cause of the Party and the cause of the people in his heart, and he dared to be a revolutionary vanguard. But I still have "I" in my mind sometimes, simply seeking stability and staying in the middle.
    Fourth, my hard work and thoroughness are not as good as Comrade Jiao Yulu's. He didn't "eat what others had chewed," and despite being seriously ill, he insisted on investigation and research. But I went to the countryside superficially, listening to reports, relying on materials, and relying on ready-made solutions. I had no idea how to fundamentally cure the disasters.
    Fifth, serving the masses and following the mass line is not as good as Jiao Yulu. He adhered to Chairman Mao's teachings of combining the general with the individual and combining leadership with the masses, achieving the principle of "from the masses, to the masses." But in my work, there are more general appeals and fewer individual combinations, more of my own activities and less combination with the masses.
    Jiao Yulu was a county Party secretary, and I am also a county Party secretary. What he has achieved, I have not yet achieved. In the final analysis, it is because I have not closely followed Mao Zedong Thought and lack the spirit of serving the people "completely" and "thoroughly."
    Acknowledging backwardness, unwilling to lag behind. I vow to work in Minquan for the rest of my life, and I will never give up until I have completely changed the face of Minquan's production.
        Chen Jia'en, Second Secretary of the Minquan County Party Committee, Henan

    承认落后不甘落后
    跟焦裕禄同志对照检查，自己落后了；但是我决心在民权干一辈子，不改变民权面貌，永不罢休。
    民权和兰考是村挨村的邻居。民权的自然条件比兰考要好一些。近年来，民权的生产逐步提高，但同兰考比较起来，步子就显得慢了。原因是什么呢？群众说得好：“村看村，户看户，社员看的是干部，干部看的是领导。”这句话，道破了问题的症结。对照焦裕禄同志检查自己，我落后很远了。
    首先，突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作不如焦裕禄。他能够坚持以毛泽东思想统帅一切，并善于用毛泽东思想武装广大干部、群众。而我学习毛主席著作还不深不透，改造自己思想也差，开会讨论生产多，商量思想建设少。
    其二，改变民权面貌的决心不如焦裕禄。他面对严重的自然灾害，有革命的胆略，有不达目的死不瞑目的决心。而我碰到啥干啥，上级布置啥抓啥，缺乏建设社会主义新民权的雄心壮志。
    其三，革命干劲不如焦裕禄。他心中只有党的事业，人民的事业，敢于当革命闯将。而自己有时还有“我”字，单纯求稳，安居中游。
    其四，工作艰苦深入不如焦裕禄同志。他不“吃别人嚼过的馍”，身患重病，坚持调查研究。而我下乡走马观花，听汇报，凭资料，靠吃现成饭，对根治灾害，心中无数。
    其五，面向群众，走群众路线不如焦裕禄。他坚持毛主席教导的一般和个别相结合，领导和群众相结合的工作方法，做到了从群众中来到群众中去。而自己在工作中一般号召多、个别结合少，自己活动多，和群众结合少。
    焦裕禄是个县委书记，我也是个县委书记，他做到的事情，我还没有做到。归根结底，就是没有紧紧跟上毛泽东思想，缺少“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的精神。
    承认落后，不甘落后。我发誓要在民权干一辈子，不彻底改变民权的生产面貌，永不罢休。
