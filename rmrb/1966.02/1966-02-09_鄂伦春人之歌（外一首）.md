    Song of the Oroqen People (and Another Poem)
    Chen Guoping
   Great Khingan Mountains, oh, ninety-nine bends,
   In ninety-nine bends, the Oroqen never left the mountains!
   Great Khingan Mountains, oh, ninety-nine roads,
   In ninety-nine roads, the Oroqen never left the old forest a step!
   Chairman Mao, you pointed out a happy road for the Oroqen,
   The Oroqen stepped into the gate of socialism in one step!
   Great Khingan Mountains, oh, ninety-nine ridges,
   Ninety-nine "fairy posts" have turned into new villages!
   Great Khingan Mountains, oh, ninety-nine mountains,
   In ninety-nine new villages, the sound of songs is loud!
   The mouth harp floats, ninety-nine kinds of joy fill the heart,
   Colorful skirts dance, ninety-nine villages celebrate a bumper year!
   Ninety-nine ridges, flowers bloom on every ridge,
   Ninety-nine kinds of trees, orioles sing in every tree,
   Tractors are running on ninety-nine slopes,
   Motorboats are sounding on ninety-nine rivers,
   Pine cone fragrance, can't compare with the Oroqen's happy life,
   The sun is warm, can't compare with Chairman Mao and the Communist Party!
   Nen River Sends
   The Nen River rushes down from the clouds,
   The flood waves roll like snow, silver waves spray smoke.
   Log drivers rush from beyond the sky with rafts,
   In the torrent, clothing flutters.
   Listen to a whistle blowing from a wave peak,
   Near the reef, see her use a long pole to point,
   Riding giant waves, it seems she's about to fly away from the river,
   A sharp turn bypasses a deep green pool of ten thousand fathoms.
   The Oroqen girl comes ashore, her complexion unchanged,
   Looking at the school badge, she graduated from the Forestry Academy,
   Hearing the wild geese, she changes clothes and mounts a horse,
   The militiaman tells me she is Captain A Shan.
   In the thick fog, hear a few copper whistles tooting,
   When the gun fires, look up and see the geese fall from the clouds,
   Ah, before my eyes is clearly a nation,
   Controlling giant waves,
   Guarding high mountains!

    鄂伦春人之歌（外一首）
    陈国屏
   大兴安岭呵九十九道弯，
   九十九道弯里鄂家没出过山！
   大兴安岭呵九十九条路，
   九十九条路鄂家没出老林一步！
   毛主席您给鄂家指出一条幸福路，
   鄂家一步就跨进了社会主义门户！
   大兴安岭呵九十九道岭，
   九十九个“仙人柱”变了新村！
   大兴安岭呵九十九座山，
   九十九个新村里歌声儿喧！
   口弦飘，九十九种欢乐把心灌满，
   彩裙舞，九十九个村庄庆丰收年！
   九十九道岗，岗岗鲜花放，
   九十九种树，树树翠鸟唱，
   九十九面坡上拖拉机在跑，
   九十九条江里电机船在响，
   松果香，比不上鄂家的日子香呵，
   太阳暖，比不上毛主席和共产党！
   嫩江流送
   嫩江奔腾从云里飞流直下，
   洪波滚雪，银涛喷烟。
   流送工赶木排天外奔来，
   洪涛里飞舞着嗦嗦衣衫。
   浪峰里听一声口哨冲出，
   近礁崖更见她长篙一点，
   乘巨浪好似要离江飞去，
   急转弯又绕过万丈碧潭。
   鄂家女上岸来面色不改，
   看校徽她毕业林业学院，
   闻猎雁她换衣上马，
   民兵告诉我是队长阿姗。
   浓雾里听几声铜哨嘟嘟，
   枪响时抬头看雁坠云间，
   呵，我眼前明明是一个民族，
   在驾驭巨浪，
   在警卫高山！
