    Xinhua News Agency, February 25th. To commemorate the upcoming 1966 "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, the All-China Women's Federation invited the Daqing Oilfield Workers' Families Victory Report Team to perform the drama "The Rising Sun" tonight.
    Over 95% of the Daqing Oilfield workers' families with labor capability have participated in collective productive labor, forming a revolutionary labor force in the construction of Daqing Oilfield. The Daqing Oilfield Workers' Families Victory Report Team consists of 45 members, most of whom are skilled laborers. They include family agricultural production team instructors and members, family workshop workers, as well as seamstresses, electricians, salespersons, and childcare workers. The "Rising Sun" they performed tells the story of how the families of Daqing Oilfield workers, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, gradually embark on the road of laborization, collectivization, and revolutionization.
    Comrade Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, met with the workers' families and watched their performance. Comrade Cai Chang praised their revolutionary spirit of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, actively participating in collective productive labor, and using literary and artistic weapons to promote the ideological revolutionization of workers' families.
    More than 1,000 executive committee members of the All-China Women's Federation and women cadres from central government organs watched today's performance. The Victory Report Team's performance was warmly welcomed by them.

    新华社二十五日讯　全国妇联为纪念即将到来的一九六六年“三八”国际劳动妇女节，今晚请大庆油田职工家属报捷队演出话剧《初升的太阳》。
    大庆油田有劳动能力的职工家属，百分之九十五以上参加了集体生产劳动，是大庆油田建设中一支革命化的劳动大军。大庆油田职工家属报捷队共四十五人，大多是劳动能手。她们中，有家属农业生产队指导员、队员，家属作坊工人以及缝补工、电工、售货员、保育员等。她们演出的《初升的太阳》就是描述大庆油田职工家属在毛泽东思想指导下，逐渐走上劳动化、集体化、革命化道路的一个故事。
    全国妇联主席蔡畅同志会见了职工家属，观看了她们的演出。蔡畅同志赞扬了她们活学活用毛主席著作、积极参加集体生产劳动和用文艺武器促进职工家属思想革命化的革命精神。
    观看今天演出的有全国妇联执行委员和中央机关妇女干部一千多人。报捷队的演出，受到她们极为热烈的欢迎。
