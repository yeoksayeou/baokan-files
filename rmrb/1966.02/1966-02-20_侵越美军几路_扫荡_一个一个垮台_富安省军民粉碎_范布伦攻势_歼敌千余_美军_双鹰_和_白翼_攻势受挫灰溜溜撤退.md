    Hanoi, February 19th (Xinhua) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the military and civilians of Phu Yen Province in South Vietnam, from January 19th to February 9th, crushed the large-scale "sweep" launched by the invading US troops and their puppet army, codenamed the "Van Buren Offensive," annihilating over 1,100 enemies, the majority of whom were invading US troops and South Korean mercenary soldiers.
    The report stated that during this period, the invading US troops, South Korean puppet troops, and the puppet army mobilized fourteen battalions, coordinated with over one hundred helicopters, two artillery battalions, and two armored vehicle regiments, to launch a large-scale invasion of Tuy Hoa District in Phu Yen Province. Wherever the enemy went, they ruthlessly implemented the "three all" policy of kill all, burn all, and destroy all, murdering over three hundred innocent people, mostly children and the elderly, burning thousands of homes, and spreading chemical poisons, destroying large areas of crops, committing heinous crimes.
    The main force of the Liberation Army, local forces, and guerrillas, filled with hatred, were determined to severely punish the enemy. They closely cooperated, bravely and resourcefully employing various tactics, fiercely attacking the enemy day and night.
    On January 21st, the Liberation Army ambushed a battalion of South Korean puppet troops southwest of Tuy Hoa District and Hoa My Commune, annihilating more than one company in one fell swoop. On January 30th, local forces and guerrillas successively crushed eight attacks by South Korean puppet troops on Phu Tho Village in Hoa Dong Commune, killing over 130 enemies. That night, the Liberation Army took the initiative to attack the enemy in Phu Thuan and Sheng Phu villages, eliminating more than one company of South Korean puppet troops and routing another enemy company.
    On February 4th, the Liberation Army intercepted the enemy and attacked enemy reinforcements in Ngoc Lam Village and My Thanh Village, annihilating over 150 invading US troops and South Korean puppet soldiers. Then, on February 6th, guerrillas engaged three enemy battalions in an intense day-long battle in My Canh Village, Hoa Sheng Commune, repelling twelve enemy attacks and annihilating over 120 South Korean puppet soldiers. On February 9th, the invading US troops launched an attack on the foothills of Qi Tuo Mountain, once again encountering fierce resistance from the Liberation Army. Valiant Liberation Army fighters, disregarding the enemy's artillery fire and aerial bombardment, charged forward like an overwhelming force, compressing the enemy into the Sui Phu area. After three hours of fierce fighting, they annihilated over 200 US troops.
    Saigon, February 19th (Xinhua) – News: Two large contingents of invading US troops launching the "Double Eagle Offensive" and "White Wing Offensive" in the coastal areas of central South Vietnam, unable to find the resourceful and flexible South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces and constantly being beaten and frustrated, have begun to retreat crestfallenly in the past two days. They were attacked by the Liberation Armed Forces during their retreat.
    Agence France-Presse, quoting sources from the US invading troops' supreme command on the 18th, stated that these "large-scale actions by the US military failed to accomplish their main mission."
    According to Western news agencies, the "Double Eagle Offensive" launched by over 5,000 US Marines in the coastal areas of Quang Ngai Province was touted as the "largest amphibious landing since the Korean War." However, for twenty days, these invading US troops either found nothing or were beaten. On the 17th, they had to declare the "end" of this "offensive." Reuters reported that these US Marines, supported by 2,000 South Vietnamese puppet troops and US naval gunfire, artillery, and aircraft, have been forced to "withdraw from a five-hundred-square-mile area" along the coast of Quang Ngai Province.
    The "White Wing Offensive" launched by nearly 10,000 invading US First Cavalry Division troops in Binh Dinh Province was subjected to heavy blows from the Liberation Armed Forces from the very beginning. It was reported that from January 28th to February 4th alone, the Liberation Armed Forces annihilated nearly 1,500 enemies in counter-"sweeps," shot down and destroyed over 80 enemy aircraft, damaged over 70 enemy aircraft, and destroyed many enemy armored vehicles and tanks. On February 6th, this contingent of US troops joined up with a portion of US Marines moving south after finding nothing in Quang Ngai Province and launched a large-scale "sweep" of the An Lao Valley in the liberated area. However, for more than ten days, these invading US troops were in a very difficult situation in the An Lao Valley, finding nothing while constantly being attacked by the Liberation Armed Forces. The invading US troops, having suffered greatly, have recently been forced to withdraw from the An Lao Valley. According to Western news agencies, on the 18th, "the last batch of cavalry division troops had withdrawn from the (An Lao) valley." However, the retreating US invading troops became targets of the Liberation Armed Forces' attacks. "Cavalry division soldiers were pinned down by intense fire from both sides of a mountain." When they "crossed a small river, they were attacked again." United Press International reported that the Liberation Armed Forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with US troops near Bong Son for three days since the 17th. A US company has been surrounded by the Liberation Armed Forces 16 kilometers south of the US First Cavalry Division's Bong Son battlefield headquarters. On the 19th, four US helicopters were shot down and damaged by the Liberation Armed Forces' ground fire.

    侵越美军几路“扫荡”一个一个垮台
    富安省军民粉碎“范布伦攻势”歼敌千余
    美军“双鹰”和“白翼”攻势受挫灰溜溜撤退
    新华社河内十九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方富安省军民从一月十九日到二月九日，粉碎了美国侵略军及其仆从军发动的名为
  “范布伦攻势”的大“扫荡”，共歼敌一千一百多名，其中大部分是美国侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军。
    报道说，在这期间，美国侵略军、南朝鲜仆从军和伪军出动了十四个营的兵力，在一百多架直升飞机、两营炮兵和两个装甲车支团的配合下，大举进犯富安省绥和县。敌人所到之处，残酷地实行杀光、烧光、毁光的“三光”政策，杀害了三百多无辜人民，其中大部分是小孩和老人，烧毁成千幢民房，并且撒放化学毒药，毁坏了大片庄稼，犯下了滔天罪行。
    解放军主力部队、地方部队和游击队怀着满腔的仇恨，决心狠狠惩罚敌人，他们密切配合，英勇机智地采用多种战术，不论白天和黑夜，都猛烈地打击敌人。
    一月二十一日，解放军在绥和县西南和美乡阻击一营南朝鲜仆从军，一举歼灭一连多。一月三十日，地方部队和游击队接连粉碎了南朝鲜仆从军对和同乡富寿村的八次进攻，打死敌人一百三十多名。当天晚上，解放军又在富顺和盛富两个村主动袭击敌人，消灭南朝鲜仆从军一连多，并且击溃另一连敌军。
    二月四日，解放军又在玉林村和美成村截击敌人和袭击敌人增援的空降部队，歼灭美国侵略军和南朝鲜仆从军一百五十多名。接着，二月六日，游击队在和盛乡美景村同三营敌军进行了整整一天的激烈战斗，击退了敌人的十二次进攻，歼灭南朝鲜仆从军一百二十多名。二月九日，美国侵略军对奇陀山脚发动进攻，再次遭到解放军的猛烈阻击。英勇的解放军战士们不顾敌人的大炮轰、飞机炸，排山倒海，直把敌人压缩到绥浮地区，激战三小时，歼灭美军二百多名。
    新华社十九日讯　西贡消息：在南越中部沿海地区发动
  “双鹰攻势”和“白翼攻势”的两大股美国侵略军，由于找不到机智灵活的越南南方解放武装力量，并且不断挨打和受挫，近两天来已经开始灰溜溜地撤退。他们在撤退中又遭到解放武装力量的袭击。
    法新社援引美国侵略军最高司令部人士十八日的话说，美军的这些“大规模行动都未能完成他们的主要使命”。
    据西方通讯社报道，由五千多名美国海军陆战队在广义省沿海地区发动的“双鹰攻势”，曾被吹嘘为“朝鲜战争以来规模最大的两栖登陆”。但是二十天来，这些美国侵略军不是扑空，就是挨打，十七日不得不宣告“结束”这个“攻势”。路透社的消息说，这些得到两千名南越伪军和美国海军炮火、大炮和飞机支援的美国海军陆战队，已经被迫从广义省沿海的“五百平方英里的地区撤退了”。
    由近一万名美国第一骑兵师侵略军在平定省发动的“白翼攻势”，从一开始就受到解放武装力量的沉重打击。据报道，单是从一月二十八日到二月四日，解放武装力量在反“扫荡”中就歼敌近一千五百名，击落和击毁敌机八十多架，击伤敌机七十多架，并且炸毁许多敌人的装甲车和战车。二月六日，这股美军同从广义省扑空后向南移动的一部分美国海军陆战队会合，并且向解放区的安老山谷进行大规模“扫荡”。但是十多天来，这批美国侵略军在安老山谷十分狼狈，一面连续扑空，一面却不断遭到解放武装力量的袭击。吃尽苦头的美国侵略军最近已被迫撤出安老山谷。据西方通讯社透露，十八日“最后一批骑兵师的部队已经撤离（安老）山谷”。但是撤退中的美国侵略军又成了解放武装力量的袭击对象。“骑兵师的士兵被从一座山的两边发射出来的猛烈火力所牵制”。当他们“过一条小河的时候，又遭到了袭击”。合众国际社的消息说，解放武装力量从十七日以来已同美军在蓬山附近激战三天。在距离美国第一骑兵师蓬山战地司令部以南十六公里的地方，一连美军已被解放武装力量包围。十九日，有四架美国直升飞机被解放武装力量的地面炮火打落和打伤。
