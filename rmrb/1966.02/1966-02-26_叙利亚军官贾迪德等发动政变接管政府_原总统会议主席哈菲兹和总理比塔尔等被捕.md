　　Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, February 25th: According to Damascus Radio broadcasts, the "Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party Provisional Regional Leadership" took over the government on the morning of the 23rd. The Provisional Regional Leadership announced the suspension of the implementation of the Syrian Provisional Constitution and the dissolution of the National Revolutionary Council.

　　Damascus Radio announced that the former Chairman of the Presidential Council, Hafez, Premier Bitar, and Defense Minister Omran had been arrested. Other leaders of the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, including Aflaq (one of the founders of the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party), Secretary-General Razzaz, Deputy Secretary-General and Vice-Chairman of the Syrian Presidential Council Shebli al-Ayssami, and Chairman of the Syrian National Revolutionary Council Mansur al-Atrash, were also arrested.

　　The new regional leadership appointed former Air Force Commander and one of the leaders of the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, Hafez al-Assad, as Defense Minister, and former Director of Intelligence Ahmed Suweidani as Chief of Staff.

　　Damascus Radio also announced the imposition of martial law throughout the country, the closure of borders, airports, and ports, and the interruption of all telecommunications with the outside world.

　　It is reported that the coup was launched by Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party officers, including former Chief of Staff Salah Jadid. Jadid served as Chief of Staff in 1963 and was elected as a key member of the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party's Syrian Regional Leadership. However, due to the development of his differences with the Hafez faction, he was removed from the post of Army Chief of Staff last September.

　　It is reported that after the coup, fighting broke out near Hafez's residence in Damascus, and the situation has now calmed down. However, the situation in the Aleppo region of northern Syria is currently unclear.

　　叙利亚军官贾迪德等发动政变接管政府
    原总统会议主席哈菲兹和总理比塔尔等被捕
    新华社二十五日讯　大马士革消息：据大马士革电台广播，“阿拉伯复兴社会党临时地区领导”在二十三日清晨接管了政府。临时地区领导宣布停止实施叙利亚临时宪法，并且解散全国革命委员会。
    大马士革电台宣布，原来的总统会议主席哈菲兹、总理比塔尔和国防部长奥姆兰已经被逮捕。阿拉伯复兴社会党的其他一些领导人包括阿弗拉克（阿拉伯复兴社会党的创始人之一）、总书记拉泽兹、副总书记和叙利亚总统会议副主席谢布利·埃萨米和叙利亚全国革命委员会主席曼苏尔·阿特拉什等也被逮捕。
    新的地区领导任命前空军司令、阿拉伯复兴社会党领导人之一哈菲兹·阿萨德担任国防部长，任命前情报局长艾哈迈德·苏韦达尼为总参谋长。
    大马士革电台还宣布在全国实行戒严、封锁边境、机场和港口，中断同外界的一切电讯联系。
    据报道，这次政变是由前总参谋长萨拉赫·贾迪德等阿拉伯复兴社会党军官发动的。贾迪德在一九六三年曾任总参谋长，并当选为阿拉伯复兴社会党叙利亚地区领导的主要成员之一。但是，由于他同哈菲兹派分歧的发展，在去年九月被解除陆军参谋长的职务。
    据报道，政变发生后，在大马士革哈菲兹住所附近发生了战斗，目前局面已经平静。但叙利亚北部阿勒颇地区的局势目前还不明朗。
