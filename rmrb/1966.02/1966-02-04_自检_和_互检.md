  "Self-Inspection" and "Mutual Inspection"
   Hua Youyi, Worker of Beijing United Plate Making Factory
    In our group, there is a worker who is usually serious and responsible in his work, meticulous in every detail. He always conducts "self-inspection" of each product he produces at the end. However, he has a strong sense of self-esteem, believing that his "self-inspected" products will not have any problems; once someone points out a fault to him during "mutual inspection," he is always somewhat unconvinced.
    The opposite of this situation is: some comrades rely on "mutual inspection" and do not pay much attention to "self-inspection." They think that since there is "mutual inspection" anyway, they do not seriously conduct "self-inspection" after finishing work.
    I believe that in production, in order to ensure the quality of products, both "self-inspection" and "mutual inspection" are essential. "Self-inspection" is very important.
  The biggest advantage of "self-inspection" is that: the product is produced by oneself, and one is familiar with all parts of the product. One knows the good and bad points of the product, and "inspecting" is convenient. Therefore, it is wrong to not pay attention to "self-inspection." However, even if "self-inspection" is very strict and detailed, there is still the possibility of missed inspections. Comrades conducting "mutual inspection" of product quality is the best way to remedy missed inspections during "self-inspection." Therefore, it is also incorrect to not welcome "mutual inspection."

  “自检”和“互检”
   北京市联合制版厂工人　华有益
    我们小组有个工人，平时干活认真负责，一丝不苟，对自己生产的产品最后都逐个进行“自检”，但是，他自尊心很强，认为自己“自检”过的产品不会有问题；一旦别人在“互检”中给他指出毛病时，他总有些不服气。
    和这种情况相反的是：有个别同志依赖“互检”，对“自检”极不重视。他们认为反正有“互检”么，所以干完活就不认真进行“自检”。
    我认为，在生产当中，为了保证产品的质量，“自检”和“互检”都是必不可少的。“自检”很重要。
  “自检”的最大优点在于：产品是自己生产的，自己对产品的各个部位都熟悉，产品那里好那里不好，心中有底，“检”起来方便。因此，不重视“自检”是不对的。不过，“自检”即使再严再细，也还有漏检的可能性。同志之间对产品质量进行“互检”，正是补救“自检”时漏检的最好手段。所以，不欢迎“互检”也是不正确的。
