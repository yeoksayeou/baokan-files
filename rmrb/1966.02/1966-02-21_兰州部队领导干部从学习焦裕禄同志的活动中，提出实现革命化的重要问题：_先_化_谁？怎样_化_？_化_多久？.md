    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 20th—In the course of studying Comrade Jiao Yulu, the Party committee secretaries above the regimental level and the intermediate and senior cadres of the Lanzhou Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have conducted in-depth discussions on how to carry out ideological revolutionization—who to "revolutionize" first, how to "revolutionize," and how long to "revolutionize" for. This has enabled everyone to further realize that only by engaging in revolution for a lifetime, studying Chairman Mao’s works for a lifetime, and transforming one's thinking for a lifetime can one maintain revolutionary youth forever.
    Recently, the Party committee of the Lanzhou Military Region held an enlarged meeting to implement the spirit of the All-Army Political Work Conference. At the meeting, the members of the Party committee, the Party committee secretaries above the regimental level, and some intermediate and senior cadres who attended the meeting seriously studied Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds and conducted in-depth discussions on how to learn Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit. During the study, everyone unanimously agreed that Comrade Jiao Yulu was a model of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works. To learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, the first step is to take him as an example, diligently study Chairman Mao’s works, and make great efforts in "application" to promote ideological revolutionization. How to carry out ideological revolutionization? Everyone focused on discussing three issues:
    (1) Revolutionization, who to "revolutionize" first? Everyone believes that, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, one should be a good "squad leader," stand at the forefront, and start by "revolutionizing" oneself.
    Many comrades used Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror to examine their own ideological revolutionization. Some said that their bodies were stronger than Comrade Jiao Yulu's, but their revolutionary drive was not as strong as his; others said that they had received Party education for longer than he had, but their acceptance of Mao Zedong Thought was slower than his. Why is this? Everyone believes that it is because they are not conscious enough about who to "revolutionize" first, and they have not put their own revolutionization in the first place. Then, everyone specifically analyzed the reasons for insufficient "revolutionization," and felt that the most fundamental reason was carrying the burden of being an "old revolutionary" and "red in old age," and relaxing their own ideological transformation. As a result, they focused more on grasping others and less on grasping themselves. In studying Chairman Mao’s works, they focused more on improving work and less on transforming their thinking. Therefore, everyone believes that the most central issue in learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu is learning his ideological revolutionization.
      (2) Revolutionization, how to "revolutionize"? Everyone believes that, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, one should regard Chairman Mao’s books as the highest instructions, make great efforts in "application," and strengthen ideological transformation. Transforming one's thinking means using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to persistently struggle against the "ego" and overcome all kinds of individualism. To study Chairman Mao’s works and make great efforts in "application," the most important thing is to put oneself into it, expose one's personal thoughts, apply what one learns, and correct what one does wrong.
    Everyone believes that to strengthen ideological revolutionization by learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, one must also use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. Ideological transformation mainly relies on one's own conscious effort, but one cannot ignore criticism and help from comrades. In the discussion, everyone also believed that to strengthen ideological revolutionization, one must also go deep into the struggles of the masses, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and share their breath and destiny with the masses. Some comrades examined the shortcomings of being "unable to go down" and "unable to stay," mainly because their feelings for soldiers are not as strong as Comrade Jiao Yulu's feelings for class brothers.
      (3) Revolutionization, how long to "revolutionize" for? Everyone said: Like Comrade Jiao Yulu, one must engage in revolution for a lifetime, "revolutionize" for a lifetime, maintain revolutionary youth forever, and continuously make revolution and advance.
    Everyone believes that revolutionization is a long-term and arduous task, and it cannot be accomplished once and for all through a sudden effort. As long as classes exist, all kinds of non-proletarian thoughts will infiltrate us through various channels. Based on this understanding, in the discussion, everyone raised such a serious question: Should intermediate and senior cadres be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, making revolution and advancing forever? Or should they be content with the status quo and stop moving forward? The answer is affirmative: we must continuously make revolution and advance. Some comrades said, "Like Comrade Jiao Yulu, we must carry a red line through to the end, and we cannot be red for only half the distance, or revolutionize only halfway." When discussing this issue, everyone pointed out that leading cadres should pay attention to preventing special privileges at all times in order to "revolutionize" for a lifetime, and should always maintain the true qualities of ordinary laborers, like Comrade Jiao Yulu.
    Finally, everyone unanimously agreed that to be a thorough revolutionary, the most fundamental thing is to arm one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought. Like Comrade Jiao Yulu, one should act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions in every move and every word, and be a good student of Chairman Mao.

    兰州部队领导干部从学习焦裕禄同志的活动中，提出实现革命化的重要问题：
　　先“化”谁？怎样“化”？“化”多久？
    新华社兰州二十日电　中国人民解放军兰州部队团以上党委书记和中高级干部在向焦裕禄同志学习的活动中，深入讨论了如何进行思想革命化——先“化”谁、怎样“化”、“化”多久的问题，使大家进一步认识到：必须干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想，才能永葆革命青春。
    最近，兰州部队党委为了贯彻全军政治工作会议精神，召开了扩大会议。会上，出席会议的党委委员、团以上党委书记和部分中高级干部，认真学习了焦裕禄同志的事迹，深入讨论了如何把焦裕禄同志的革命精神学到手。学习中，大家一致认为焦裕禄同志是活学活用毛主席著作的典范，向焦裕禄同志学习，首先是以他为榜样，刻苦学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，促进思想革命化。怎样进行思想革命化？大家着重讨论了三个问题：
    （一）革命化，先“化”谁？大家认为，要象焦裕禄同志那样，当好“班长”，站在排头，先从自己“化”起。
    不少同志以焦裕禄同志为镜子，检查了自己思想革命化的问题。有的说自己的身体比焦裕禄同志棒，但革命干劲就不如他；有的说自己受党的教育比他久，但接受毛泽东思想比他慢。为什么会这样？大家认为，就是对革命化首先“化”谁不够自觉，没有把自己的革命化摆在第一位。接着大家具体分析了“化”得不够的原因，觉得最根本的是背了“老革命”、“老来红”的包袱，放松了自己的思想改造。结果，就形成了抓别人多，抓自己少。在学习毛主席著作中，用于改进工作多，用于改造思想少。因此，大家认为学习焦裕禄同志，最核心的问题是学习他的思想革命化。
      （二）革命化，怎么“化”？大家认为，要象焦裕禄同志那样，把毛主席的书当作最高指示，在“用”字上狠下功夫，加强思想改造。改造思想，就是要以毛泽东思想为武器，坚持不懈地与“我”字作斗争，克服形形色色的个人主义。学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，最重要的是要把自己摆进去，把个人的思想亮出来，学了就用，错了就改。
    大家认为，学习焦裕禄同志加强思想革命化，还必须运用批评与自我批评的武器。思想改造主要靠自己自觉进行，但也不能忽视同志间的批评帮助。讨论中大家还认为，加强思想革命化，还必须象焦裕禄同志那样，深入到群众斗争中去，与群众同呼吸，共命运。有些同志检查“下不去”“蹲不住”的毛病，主要是对战士的感情，不如焦裕禄同志对待阶级弟兄那样浓厚。
      （三）革命化，“化”多久？大家说：要象焦裕禄同志那样，干一辈子革命，“化”一辈子，永葆革命青春，不断革命，不断前进。
    大家认为，革命化是个长期、艰巨的任务，不是突击一下，就可一劳永逸。只要有阶级存在，各种非无产阶级思想就会通过各种渠道侵袭我们。基于这个认识，在讨论中，大家提出这样一个严肃的问题：中、高级干部是象焦裕禄同志那样永远革命，永远前进呢？还是安于现状，停止不前呢？回答是肯定的：要不断革命，不断前进。有的同志说，“要象焦裕禄同志一样，一根红线穿到底，不能红半截，革命一半。”在讨论这个问题的时候，大家指出领导干部要做到“化”一辈子，还要时刻注意防止特殊化，要象焦裕禄同志那样，永远保持普通劳动者的本色。
    最后大家一致认为，要做彻底的革命派，最根本的是用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。象焦裕禄同志那样，一举一动，一言一行，都按毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好学生。
