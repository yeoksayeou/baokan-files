    After reading Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, I often think:
    Am I as loyal to the revolution as he was?
    Am I as completely and thoroughly for the people as he was?
    These past few days, my heart has been unable to calm down, and my mind often wonders: Am I, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, wholeheartedly loyal to the revolution? Am I, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, completely and thoroughly dedicated to the people? Compared to Comrade Jiao Yulu, I deeply feel that I am inferior to him in many aspects.
    My ideological revolutionization is not as good as Comrade Jiao Yulu's. In order to completely change the face of Lankao and eradicate the "three harms," he studied and applied Chairman Mao's works creatively in everything he did, strictly demanding himself with revolutionary standards, and driving the revolutionary transformation of the county committee's leadership core. He truly practiced revolutionizing production by first revolutionizing thought; and revolutionizing thought by first resolving the ideological revolutionization of the county committee's leadership core. In recent years, agricultural production in our Changshu has seen some development. Under these circumstances, cadres have begun to develop "three selfs" (pride and complacency, sticking to old ways, self-righteousness), "three satisfactions" (satisfaction, complacency, self-assurance), and "one ceiling" (production has reached its peak) thinking. When addressing these problems, we did not, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, first focus on the ideological revolutionization of the county committee leadership itself, which is reflected in a lack of high standards in thought and work. Therefore, the problems have not been completely resolved. Now, from Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds, I realize that only when the county committee has the thought of continuous revolution and thorough revolution can it guide the cadres and people of the entire county to continuously move forward.
    My work is not as good as Comrade Jiao Yulu's. He carried profound class feelings and the boundless ambition of the proletariat, holding the entire people of Lankao County in his heart, taking the suffering of the masses as his own, and the joy of the masses as his own. In Lankao County, with such severe natural disasters and such difficult lives for the masses, he was not afraid of hardship or death, dared to shoulder heavy responsibilities, and carried out arduous work. Looking at the situation in our Changshu, the conditions are much better than in Lankao, and we should do a better job in production. However, we have not yet met the requirements of the Party and the people at higher levels. This is mainly because I lack profound class feelings in my thinking and lack the thought of "thinking what the masses think and being anxious about what the masses are anxious about," and serving the people completely and thoroughly.
    My work style is not as good as Comrade Jiao Yulu's. He always used a selfless spirit, going deep into reality, conducting investigations and research, and working in a down-to-earth manner, gaining a clear understanding of the entire county's situation. However, I have been working in Changshu for more than two years, and I have not stayed long in one place, nor have I covered a wide enough area. I often talk more and do less, making general calls more and conducting investigations and research less. For example, in some areas of our county with limited land and a large population, developing diversified operations is a major issue. If this problem is not solved, it will not only affect the further improvement of the lives of the commune members, but also affect the sustainable development of agricultural production and the further consolidation of the collective economy. However, I did not, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, go deep into those places, stay there, and work with the masses to find a way out. Therefore, this problem has not yet been solved.
    Why are there these gaps? I feel that the most fundamental problem is that I have not, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, earnestly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works creatively, and used Mao Zedong Thought to transform myself and guide my work. I must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works creatively, take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and everything for the people, and work with all the comrades of the county committee to do a better job in Changshu, and live up to the expectations of the Party at higher levels and the people of the entire county.

### 读了焦裕禄同志的事迹，经常在想：我象他那样赤胆忠心为革命吗？  我象他那样完全彻底为人民吗？

    读了焦裕禄同志的事迹，经常在想：
    我象他那样赤胆忠心为革命吗？
    我象他那样完全彻底为人民吗？
    这几天，我的心始终无法平静下来，脑子里经常在想：自己是不是象焦裕禄同志那样，赤胆忠心地为革命？是不是象焦裕禄同志那样，完全、彻底地为人民？与焦裕禄同志一比，我深深感到有许多方面不如他。
    思想革命化不如焦裕禄同志。他为了彻底改变兰考面貌，根治“三害”，时时事事活学活用毛主席著作，以革命化的要求严格要求自己，并带动县委领导核心革命化。真正做到革生产的命，首先革思想的命；革思想的命，首先解决县委领导核心思想革命化。近年来，我们常熟的农业生产有了些发展。在这种情况下，干部中开始产生了“三自”（骄傲自满、故步自封、自以为是）、“三心”（心满意足、心安理得、心里笃定）、“一到顶”（增产到顶）的思想。在解决这些问题的时候，我们没有象焦裕禄同志那样，首先抓住县委领导本身的思想革命化，反映在思想上、工作上就缺乏高标准的要求。因此，问题没有得到彻底解决。现在我从焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹中认识到，只有县委有了不断革命和彻底革命思想，才能引导全县干部和人民不断前进。
    工作上不如焦裕禄同志。他怀着深厚的阶级感情和无产阶级的雄心壮志，心里装着兰考县全体人民，以群众的痛苦为自己的痛苦，以群众的欢乐为自己的欢乐。在兰考县自然灾害那样严重，群众生活那样困难的情况下，他不怕艰难困苦，不怕生死病痛，敢于挑起重担，进行艰苦工作。从我们常熟的情况来看，条件要比兰考好得多，应当把生产工作搞得更好，但是现在还没有达到上级党和人民的要求。这主要是我在思想上缺乏深厚的阶级感情，缺乏“想群众之想，急群众之急”，完全彻底为人民服务的思想。
    作风上不如焦裕禄同志。他时时以忘我的精神，深入实际，调查研究，踏踏实实去工作，把全县情况弄得清清楚楚。而我到常熟工作已有两年多，点没有蹲下去，面跑得不宽，平时往往口头讲得多，实际做得少，一般号召多，调查研究少。例如我县有些田少人多地区，发展多种经营是个大问题。这个问题不解决，不仅影响到社员进一步改善生活，而且影响到农业生产的持续发展和集体经济的进一步巩固。但是，我没有象焦裕禄同志那样，深入到那些地方，蹲下来，与群众一起研究，闯出一条路来。因此，这个问题到现在还没有得到解决。
    为什么会出现这些差距？我感到最根本的问题是，没有象焦裕禄同志那样，认真地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来改造自己，指导工作。我一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以焦裕禄同志为榜样，树立一心为革命、一切为人民的思想，与县委全体同志一道，把常熟的工作做得更好，不辜负上级党和全县人民的期望。
