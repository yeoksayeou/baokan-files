　　Cultivate Thousands of Jiao Yulus-Like Leading Cadres
　　Rely on Millions of Masses to Thoroughly Change the Face of Henan
　　Henan Provincial Party Committee Plenary Session Studies Jiao Yulu's Deeds, Calls on Party Members, Cadres, and Masses Throughout the Province to Promote the Study of Mao Zedong's Works to a New Stage Through Extensive and In-depth Study of Jiao Yulu

　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, February 23rd: At the recent plenary session of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the comrades participating in the meeting spent two days studying the exemplary deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu. They took Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, combined their thoughts and work to conduct study and discussions, put forward the direction for future revolutionization, and were determined to lead the people of the province to struggle to the end to thoroughly change the face of Henan.

　　Liu Jianxun, First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee, and Wen Minsheng, Second Secretary and Governor of the province, personally presided over the study and discussion. They called on Party members, cadres, and the broad masses throughout the province to launch an extensive and in-depth movement to study Comrade Jiao Yulu. Party committees at all levels must take the lead in studying and lead this study well. It is required that through this study, the movement to study Chairman Mao's works throughout the province be promoted to a new stage, greatly promoting the ideological revolutionization of the people, changing the mental outlook, and cultivating thousands of strong leading cadres like Comrade Jiao Yulu. They pointed out that this spiritual power will inevitably turn into a huge material force in the struggle to thoroughly change the face of Henan.

　　The comrades participating in the meeting unanimously believed that Comrade Jiao Yulu is worthy of being a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong and a great communist fighter. He pioneered a path for Henan to overcome natural disasters and set a brilliant example for the realization of the revolutionization of leadership. Everyone generally felt that compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, they were far behind and needed to catch up. Some comrades said: "After participating in the revolution for decades, I originally thought that the issue of worldview had been resolved, so when studying Chairman Mao's works, I focused more on work methods and paid insufficient attention to ideological transformation. Now it seems that this is not the case. I have not truly understood Chairman Mao's works, and this is reflected in my work, sometimes better and sometimes worse."

　　Some comrades said: "In the past, when work was not done well, I often looked for reasons in work methods. Now I realize that the problem is that the worldview has not been completely resolved." Many comrades proposed that leading cadres at all levels must earnestly solve the problem of better revolutionizing themselves in the second half of their lives, continuously strengthen ideological transformation, and never be satisfied with just "getting by." They must make their thinking "ironclad," eliminate "self," promote "public interest," and establish a thorough revolutionary worldview. They must use their own ideological revolutionization to drive the ideological revolutionization of all cadres, so that they can be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, unafraid of hardship and death, infinitely loyal to the revolution, and dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to the people.

　　Many comrades mentioned in their speeches that Comrade Jiao Yulu's arduous and meticulous working style of conducting investigation and research was a great inspiration to them. Some comrades said: Jiao Yulu went deep among the masses and summarized their experience in eliminating the "three harms" in over a year. We have been working in a region for more than 20 years, but we still don't have a thorough understanding of the situation in the whole region. The fundamental problem is the lack of a pragmatic spirit of going deep among the masses to conduct investigation and research. Some comrades said: Henan often suffers from natural disasters. What do we rely on to overcome them? Comrade Jiao Yulu relied on the masses and took the road of self-reliance; but some local leading cadres are looking upwards, relying on the state, not relying on the masses, not being self-reliant, and not believing that the masses can liberate themselves. As a result, the face of production changes very slowly. This problem must be thoroughly resolved. Everyone expressed that they must be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, having both revolutionary boldness and soaring drive, as well as a pragmatic attitude.

　　The comrades participating in the meeting also talked about not being as full of strong class feelings, vigorously supporting, and actively promoting the advanced things created by the people, like Comrade Jiao Yulu. Some comrades said: We don't summarize advanced experiences enough, don't establish enough models, and don't promote them enough. This is a matter of mental state. There are many Dazhai-style and Daqing-style models in Henan, such as Lin County, Nancuizhuang Brigade, Shiban'yan Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Nanyang Alcohol Factory, etc., and there are also many advanced models in various regions. Although we have paid some attention to them in the past, we have not held up the banner high enough and have failed to promote them vigorously throughout the province and in this region. Some advanced units have become "bonsai." Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, everyone realized that summarizing and promoting advanced models and advanced experiences is not just a matter of work methods, but a matter of attitude towards advanced things.

　　The meeting believed that since the Provincial Party Committee issued the notice on studying Comrade Jiao Yulu, a wave of learning has been set off throughout the province and is developing in depth. The meeting demanded that on the existing basis, the movement to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu should be carried out more widely and deeply, so that every household knows and everyone knows, and that Comrade Jiao Yulu's thorough revolutionary spirit will spread throughout the province.

　　培养千百个焦裕禄那样的领导干部
　　依靠千百万群众彻底改变河南面貌
　　河南省委全体会议学习焦裕禄事迹，号召全省党员、干部和群众通过广泛深入学习焦裕禄，把学习毛主席著作运动推向一个新的阶段
    新华社郑州二十三日电　在最近召开的中共河南省委全体会议上，参加会议的同志，以两天时间学习了焦裕禄同志的模范事迹，以焦裕禄同志为榜样，联系思想和工作进行了学习讨论，提出了今后革命化的方向，决心领导全省人民为彻底改变河南面貌奋斗到底。
    河南省委第一书记刘建勋，第二书记、省长文敏生亲自主持了学习讨论。他们号召全省党员、干部和广大群众开展一个广泛深入地学习焦裕禄同志的运动。各级党委都要带头学习，并领导好这次学习。要求通过这次学习，把全省学习毛主席著作运动推向一个新的阶段，大大促进人的思想革命化，改变精神面貌，培养千百个象焦裕禄同志那样坚强的领导干部。他们指出，这种精神力量，在彻底改变河南面貌的斗争中，必然会变成巨大的物质力量。
    参加会议的同志一致认为，焦裕禄同志不愧为毛泽东同志的好学生，不愧为伟大的共产主义战士。他为河南战胜自然灾害闯出了一条道路，为实现领导革命化树立了光辉榜样。大家普遍感到，和焦裕禄同志相比，自己差距很大，需要迎头赶上。有的同志说：“参加革命几十年来，原以为世界观的问题已经解决，所以在学习毛主席著作时，多偏重于工作方法方面，对改造思想则注意不够。现在看来并非如此，对毛主席的著作并未真正学懂，反映在工作上，有时好一些，有时就差一些。”
    有的同志说：“过去工作做不好，多是从工作方法上找原因，现在认识到是世界观问题还没有彻底解决。”很多同志提出，各级领导干部，必须认真解决后半辈子更好地革命的问题，要永不停息地加强思想改造，决不能满足于“过得去”，一定要使自己的思想“过得硬”，一定要斗掉“我”字，提倡“公”，树立彻底革命的世界观。要以自己的思想革命化，来带动全体干部的思想革命化，做到象焦裕禄同志那样，不怕苦，不怕死，对革命无限忠诚，为人民鞠躬尽瘁。
    许多同志在发言中都提到，焦裕禄同志艰苦细致地进行调查研究的工作作风，对自己有很大启发。有的同志说：焦裕禄同志在一年多的时间里，深入群众，总结了群众除“三害”的经验。我们在一个地区工作二十多年了，至今对全区的情况还摸得不透。根本问题是缺乏深入群众调查研究的实干精神。有些同志说：河南经常遭受自然灾害，战胜灾害依靠什么？焦裕禄同志是依靠群众，走自力更生的道路；可是有些地方的领导干部是两眼向上，依赖国家，不依靠群众，不自力更生，不相信群众自己能够解放自己，结果，生产面貌改变得很慢。这个问题必须彻底解决。大家纷纷表示，一定要象焦裕禄同志那样，做到既有革命的胆略，冲天的干劲，又有实事求是的态度。
    参加会议的同志还谈到，对人民群众创造的先进事物，不象焦裕禄同志那样，充满着强烈的阶级感情，大力支持，积极推广。有些同志说：我们总结先进经验不够，树立典型不够，推广得也不够，这是个精神状态问题。河南有不少大寨式的和大庆式的典型，如林县、南崔庄大队、石板岩供销社、南阳酒精厂等，各地区也有不少先进典型。过去虽然抓了一下，但旗帜举得不高，未能很好在全省、在本地区大力推广，有些先进单位成了“盆景”。和焦裕禄同志相比，大家认识到，总结、推广先进典型和先进经验，这不单是个工作方法问题，而是在对待先进事物的态度的问题。
    会议认为：自从省委发出学习焦裕禄同志的通知以后，全省掀起了学习热潮，并向着深入方面发展。会议要求，在现有基础上，要更广泛更深入地开展向焦裕禄同志学习的运动，做到家喻户晓，人人皆知，让焦裕禄同志的彻底革命精神红遍全省。
