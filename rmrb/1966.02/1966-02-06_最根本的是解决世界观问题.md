    The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee pointed out that arming oneself, arming the vast number of cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought is not a general learning problem, but a problem of whether or not to continue the revolution. County-level and above cadres should also especially emphasize ideological transformation in their studies and further solve the problem of worldview.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th) The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), at a recent series of meetings of prefectural party secretaries and meetings of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee, emphasized that cadres at and above the county level should first seriously study Chairman Mao's works.
    At the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the CPC, attendees exchanged their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works and further realized that highlighting politics and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and arming oneself, arming the vast number of cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, is not a general learning problem, but a problem of whether or not to continue the revolution. It is a question of whether or not to carry the domestic revolution through to the end after the Chinese proletariat has seized power, whether or not to support the world revolution, and whether or not every Communist Party member, revolutionary cadre, and revolutionary people should transform themselves in the process of carrying out the three great revolutions. If we are to carry the revolution through to the end, we must arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought.
    The meeting pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought is the great theory of our great era, and the most powerful ideological weapon for us to do a good job in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and to carry out world revolution. At present, we should first conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and education on the great significance of Mao Zedong Thought among all Communist Party members in the province, so that all party members and the vast number of cadres and the masses can further understand the great significance of studying Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, we must further resolve the living ideas of studying Chairman Mao's works among them, continue to deepen the great debate on the relationship between politics and production, business, and technology, and implement this work at the grassroots level.
    The meeting proposed that, at present, in the whole province, highlighting politics and studying Chairman Mao's works, we should mainly focus on the following three aspects of work: First, we should conscientiously grasp the study of cadres at and above the county level; second, in areas where the socialist education movement is being carried out in the province, we should arrange a period of time in the movement to systematically summarize the work and launch a great debate on the relationship between politics and production, business, and technology, to specifically solve the problem of understanding of highlighting politics and studying Chairman Mao's works, and on this basis, establish a basic-level political and ideological work system; third, in areas where the socialist education movement has not been systematically carried out, we should conscientiously carry out a number of truly outstanding political points at the grassroots level. We must organize a work team to do a good job of highlighting a number of political points, and then use the experience of these points to drive the whole area forward and comprehensively promote these points’ experience.
    The meeting held that, in the future, in addition to doing a good job in regular political and ideological work, all central tasks should highlight politics. For example, the annual busy agricultural production, distribution, and disaster relief struggles in rural areas should all first become political movements, and by carrying out political and ideological education among the masses, we should give full play to people's enthusiasm, complete various tasks, and further promote people's ideological revolutionization.
    The meeting particularly emphasized the importance of cadres at and above the county level studying Chairman Mao's works, and demanded that cadres at and above the county level truly learn well. They are required to be determined and highly conscious in studying Chairman Mao's works. They must study with a fundamental stand and class feeling that is truly loyal to Chairman Mao's thought, believes in it without any doubt at any time, and takes Chairman Mao's works as the criterion for all their actions; it must be clear that the main purpose of studying Chairman Mao's works is to transform thinking and solve problems in work, and first of all to transform thinking. The meeting believed that cadres at and above the county level should also especially emphasize ideological transformation, fight against all individualistic distracting thoughts, and further solve the problems of outlook on life and worldview.
    The meeting also discussed issues such as improving the learning system and strengthening the organization and leadership of learning by party committees at all levels, in accordance with the decision of the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.

    最根本的是解决世界观问题
    广东省委指出，用毛泽东思想武装自己、武装广大干部和群众，并不是一般的学习问题，而是要不要继续革命的问题。县级以上干部在学习中，同样要特别强调改造思想，进一步解决世界观问题。
    据新华社广州四日电　中共广东省委在最近一个时期分别召开的地委书记会议和省委常委会议上，强调指出县级以上的干部首先要认真学好毛主席著作。
    在中共广东省委常委会议上，出席会议的人交谈了学习毛主席著作的心得后，进一步认识到突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想武装自己、武装广大干部和群众，并不是一般的学习问题，而是要不要继续革命的问题。是在我国无产阶级取得政权之后要不要把国内革命进行到底，要不要支援世界革命，每一个共产党员、革命干部和革命人民要不要在进行三大革命的过程中改造自己的问题。如果要将革命进行到底，就必须用毛泽东思想把自己的头脑武装起来。
    会议指出，毛泽东思想是我们这个伟大时代的伟大理论，是我们搞好社会主义革命和社会主义建设、进行世界革命的最强大的思想武器。当前首先应在全省共产党员中广泛、深入地进行关于毛泽东思想的伟大意义的宣传教育，使全体党员和广大干部群众进一步认识学习毛泽东思想的伟大意义。同时要在他们之中进一步解决好学习毛主席著作的活思想，继续深入开展政治与生产、业务、技术的关系问题的大辩论，并将这一工作落实到基层去。
    会议提出，当前全省突出政治、学习毛主席著作，主要应抓好三个方面的工作：一是认真抓好县级以上干部的学习；二是全省开展社会主义教育运动的地区，要在运动中安排一段时间，通过系统地总结工作，开展关于政治与生产、业务、技术的关系问题的大辩论，专门解决突出政治、学习毛主席著作的认识问题，在这基础上，建立起基层的政治思想工作制度；三是没有系统地开展社会主义教育运动的地区，要在基层认真搞好一批真正突出政治的点。要组织一支工作队，搞好一批突出政治的点，然后以点带面，全面推广这些点的经验。
    会议认为，今后除了做好经常性的政治思想工作外，一切中心工作都应当突出政治。例如农村中每年都有的生产大忙、分配以及抗灾斗争等，都应当首先成为政治运动，通过向群众进行政治思想教育，发挥人的积极性，完成各项任务，进一步促进人的思想革命化。
    会议特别强调县级以上干部学习毛主席著作的重要性，要求县级以上干部真正学好。要求他们下定决心，对学习毛主席著作要有高度的自觉。要带着真正忠实于毛主席的思想、任何时候都坚信不疑、把毛主席的著作作为自己一切行动准则这样的根本立场和阶级感情去学；要明确学习毛主席著作，主要是为了改造思想和解决工作中的问题，而首先是为了改造思想。会议认为，县级以上干部同样要特别强调改造思想，同一切个人主义杂念作斗争，进一步解决人生观、世界观的问题。
    会议还根据中共中央中南局的决定，讨论了关于健全学习制度，加强各级党委对学习的组织领导等问题。
