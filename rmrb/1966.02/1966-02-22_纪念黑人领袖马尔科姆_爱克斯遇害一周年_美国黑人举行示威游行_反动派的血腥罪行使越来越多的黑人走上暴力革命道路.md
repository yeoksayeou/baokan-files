　　Xinhua News Agency, February 21st dispatch from New York: Many American Black people held demonstrations and parades on the streets of Harlem in New York City on the 20th to commemorate the first anniversary of the assassination of Black leader Malcolm X.
　　American Black people have also decided to hold a rally on the 21st to commemorate Malcolm X.
　　Malcolm X, the American Black leader who resolutely fought for Black people's freedom, was assassinated by American reactionaries on February 21st of last year while delivering a speech at a Black people's rally in Harlem, New York City.
　　Malcolm X was originally the chairman of the Organization of Afro-American Unity. During his lifetime, he actively fought for the survival rights of American Black people and advocated that American Black people could take all means, including violence, in the struggle against racial oppression and for their own rights. His views were resented by government authorities and racists. Before his assassination, he had been threatened by the American reactionaries in many ways, but he persisted and continued to fight for the rights of American Black people.
　　The American reactionaries’ despicable crime of murdering Malcolm X aroused strong condemnation from American and world public opinion. After his assassination, thousands of people in New York attended his funeral, and about 30,000 people went to the funeral home to pay their respects to his remains.
　　Malcolm X’s blood was not shed in vain. The American reactionaries’ bloody crimes have educated the broad masses of American Black people, making them more determined to join the struggle for their own rights. The stormy development of the American Black people's struggle in the past year is a good proof. More and more American Black people are awakening to the fact that only by taking the path of revolutionary violence pointed out by Malcolm X can they truly liberate themselves. The heroic anti-violence struggle of 7,000 Black people in the Watts district of Los Angeles in August last year marked a new awakening of American Black people.

　　纪念黑人领袖马尔科姆·爱克斯遇害一周年
　　美国黑人举行示威游行
　　反动派的血腥罪行使越来越多的黑人走上暴力革命道路
    新华社二十一日讯　纽约消息：很多美国黑人二十日在纽约市哈莱姆区街道上举行示威游行，纪念黑人领袖马尔科姆·爱克斯遇害一周年。
    美国黑人们还决定在二十一日举行纪念马尔科姆·爱克斯的集会。
    坚决为争取黑人自由而斗争的美国黑人领袖马尔科姆·爱克斯，是在去年二月二十一日在纽约市哈莱姆区一次黑人集会上发表演说时被美国反动派杀害的。
    马尔科姆·爱克斯原是非洲裔美国人统一组织的主席。他生前积极为争取美国黑人的生存权利而斗争，并且主张美国黑人在反对种族压迫，争取自身权利的斗争中，可以采取包括暴力在内的一切手段。他的这种主张遭到了政府当局和种族主义分子的忌恨。在遇害前他就曾经受到过美国反动派的多方威胁，但是他坚持不屈，继续为美国黑人的权利而斗争。
    美国反动派谋杀马尔科姆·爱克斯的卑鄙罪行，引起了美国和世界舆论的强烈谴责。在他遇害后，在纽约有数千人参加了他的葬礼，大约三万人前往殡仪馆瞻仰了他的遗容。
    马尔科姆·爱克斯的血没有白流。美国反动派的血腥罪行教育了美国广大的黑人群众，使他们更坚决地投入争取自身权利的斗争。这一年来，美国黑人斗争疾风暴雨般的发展，就是一个很好的证明。越来越多的美国黑人觉醒到只有走马尔科姆·爱克斯所指出的革命暴力的道路，才能使自己真正得到解放。去年八月间洛杉矶市瓦茨区七千黑人拿起武器进行英勇的抗暴斗争，标志着美国黑人的新觉醒。
