　　　　Colorful

　　The Sato government of Japan is actively preparing to gather a group of American puppets and lackeys from South Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines to hold a so-called "Southeast Asian Countries Development Ministers Conference."  Clearly, its purpose is to put together a new anti-China alliance in Asia.  The Japanese bourgeois newspapers and news agencies do not conceal this.  Kyodo News openly revealed that this "conference" will put forward a "political line that confronts China, which advocates a hardline anti-American line."

　　However, the Sato government is still trying its best to cover up, saying that the meeting has no "political color." Do the Japanese reactionaries think everyone else is colorblind? In fact, with such a bunch of characters sitting together, its "political color" is vivid enough. The Sato clique wants to act as the vanguard of the US in opposing China, and at the same time wants to conceal their actions, which only shows that they are very guilty.

    色彩鲜明
    日本佐藤政府积极准备把南越、泰国、菲律宾等一伙美国的傀儡和仆从召集在一起来开所谓“东南亚各国开发部长会议”。很显然，其目的是要拼凑新的亚洲反华联盟。关于这一点，日本的资产阶级报刊和通讯社也不掩饰。共同社就公开透露，这个“会议”将提出一个“同主张反美强硬路线的中国相对抗的政治路线”。
    但是，佐藤政府还竭力遮遮掩掩，说什么会议毫无“政治色彩”。日本反动派以为别人都是色盲吗？事实上，这样一班脚色坐在一起，它的“政治色彩”就够鲜明的了。佐藤之流既要充当美国反华的急先锋，又想掩饰自己的行迹，只能表明他们心虚得很。
