　　Dazhiqiao Non-staple Food Store, in order to increase business, often went to the street that was planned to be supplied by another store to sell vegetables, but rarely considered how to facilitate the purchase of goods by residents in nearby remote alleys. This practice is obviously wrong.

　　How to solve this problem? The Xuanwai Non-staple Food Store No. 1 Party Branch, which was responsible for leading this store, initially adopted administrative orders.

　　First, boundaries were drawn to determine the supply range of the two stores, prohibiting the Dazhiqiao store from crossing the boundary to sell vegetables; the problem was not solved, so they were criticized at the conference; the problem was still not solved, so they replaced the leading cadres of this store. When things developed to this point, various administrative measures were almost exhausted, but the problem remained unsolved.

　　Later, this Party branch turned back and started with ideological and political work, and as a result, the problem was readily solved.

　　Some comrades who are accustomed to relying on administrative orders always believe that administrative orders are a panacea. One order can solve any problem. The facts of the Dazhiqiao Non-staple Food Store show that without doing political and ideological work, relying solely on administrative orders often cannot solve the problem.

　　Some comrades who are accustomed to relying on administrative orders always think that ideological and political work cannot quench the immediate thirst, and is not as effective as administrative orders. The facts of the Dazhiqiao Non-staple Food Store show that ideological work is effective as soon as it is grasped, and it is truly immediate.

　　People's actions are all controlled by their thoughts. If ideological awareness is not improved and ideological problems are not resolved, how can work be done well?

    什么最灵验
    达智桥副食店为了多做生意，常到按计划该由另一个商店负责供应的大街上去卖菜，而对如何方便附近偏僻胡同的居民买东西，却很少考虑。这种做法，显然不对。
    怎么解决这个问题？负责领导这个商店的宣外副食一店党支部，开始采取的是行政命令的办法。
    先是划界，确定两家商店的供应范围，不许达智桥店跨界卖菜；问题没有解决，又在大会上批评；问题还没有解决，就撤换这个商店的领导干部。事情发展到这一步，各种行政措施快用完了，可是问题照旧没有解决。
    后来，这个党支部返回头来，从思想政治工作入手，结果问题迎刃而解。
    某些习惯于靠行政命令办事的同志，总认为行政命令是万能灵药。一道命令，什么问题也可以解决。达智桥副食店的事实说明，不做政治思想工作，单靠行政命令，往往是解决不了问题的。
    某些习惯于靠行政命令办事的同志，总以为做思想政治工作远水解不了近渴，不如行政命令能立见功效。达智桥副食店的事实却说明，思想工作一抓就灵，真正是立竿见影。
    人的行动都是由思想支配的。思想觉悟不提高，思想问题不解决，工作怎么可能做好呢？
