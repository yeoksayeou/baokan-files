    According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 4th: The Nanfang Brigade of Yixing Commune in Guangling County, Shanxi Province, is conducting mass millet scientific experiments, breaking the outdated concept that "millet is a low-yield crop," and achieving high and abundant millet harvests for two consecutive years.
    In 1964, the brigade's 217 mu of millet yielded an average of 656.5 jin per mu. Last year, the millet planting area was expanded to 257 mu (accounting for more than 35% of the total grain field area). Despite encountering severe natural disasters such as drought, hail, wind, and insects, 217 mu achieved an average yield of 623 jin per mu, and the remaining 40 mu of millet also reached an average yield of 400 jin.
    The Nanfang Brigade is located under the Caoduo Mountains outside Yanmen Pass, on the banks of the Huliu River. The terrain here is high and cold, and the land is barren. In the past, the average millet yield per mu was only 70 or 80 jin. Therefore, for many years, many people always believed that millet had a low yield, a small increase in production, and not much prospect for development, advocating for less millet planting. They pinned their hopes for rapidly increasing grain production on expanding the corn planting area, squeezing the millet land very little when arranging the planting area, and mostly using poor land.
    The small amount of millet planted and the low yield caused many contradictions in the Nanfang Brigade's production and life. The millet that commune members liked to eat, the millet straw used to feed large livestock, and the millet bran used to feed pigs were all reduced, and the collective and commune members' income was also affected. This situation prompted cadres and commune members to re-examine the millet production problem. They seriously summed up their experiences and lessons and believed that it was necessary to rationally arrange the planting ratio of various crops based on the overall needs and local conditions; to carry forward the Dazhai spirit, break the outdated concepts about millet, actively develop millet production, and eliminate the low yield of millet.
    In order to explore the high-yield path of millet, the Nanfang Brigade established a millet scientific experiment group with the participation of cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians, led personally by Liu Qing, the secretary of the brigade party branch; and with this group as the core, launched mass scientific experiment activities. They identified seven excellent varieties of millet suitable for local planting, including "Dabai Gu" and "Dongfang Liang," which have high yields, good quality, and low incidence of disease, and promoted them on a large scale throughout the brigade.
    The inability to ensure a full stand of millet seedlings was a major obstacle to the Nanfang Brigade's substantial increase in millet production. After solving the millet seed problem, the cadres and commune members were determined to overcome this difficulty. One day, Party Branch Secretary Liu Qing and old poor peasant commune members Wang Yuanshan, Wang Xi, and others squatted in the millet field to study the cause of seedling death. They pulled up the dried-up millet seedlings and found a small black spot at the root, like a needle prick. When they peeled it open, they found a small insect inside. Only then did they understand that the millet seedlings were being bitten to death by "stem borers." After long-term observation, Liu Qing learned the entire activity pattern of the stem borer's pupation, moth transformation, egg laying, and hatching of small insects that harm millet seedlings. At key moments, they sprayed pesticides, which worked very well; removed and burned all the "dead-heart seedlings"; and burned the millet stubble in combination with autumn plowing to eliminate overwintering larvae. This ensured a full stand of millet seedlings.
    The brigade also conducted experiments and implemented rational close planting of millet based on water, fertilizer, and other conditions, changing the old rule of "sparse millet produces large ears, leaving three seedlings at a step." This played a significant role in high millet yields.
    Last spring, there was no thorough rain, and the soil moisture was poor. After the seedlings emerged, the lack of seedlings and broken ridges due to drought were very serious. At this time, some people advocated destroying the millet and replanting corn or other crops. The Party branch believed that winning a high millet yield was a revolution, and they must not go backwards. They must find a set of drought-resistant and yield-increasing experiences. Therefore, it was decided to transplant seedlings. Fearing that the dry soil would prevent them from surviving, they carried water to irrigate the transplanted seedlings. Everyone worked together to create the miracle of a full stand of seedlings on every ridge. After entering summer, there was still no thorough rain, and the millet seedlings suffered severely from drought. They adopted measures such as early thinning, early hoeing, and early watering to fight against the drought. In late August, they suffered from hail, wind, and other disasters. They launched hoeing, loosening soil, and topdressing activities, supporting the millet plants that had been knocked down by hail and wind one by one, and finally achieved a bumper harvest of millet in a year of severe drought.

    开展群众性的谷子科学实验
    南房大队谷子低产变高产
  据新华社太原四日电　山西省广灵县宜兴公社南房大队开展群众性的谷子科学实验，破除“谷子是低产作物”的陈旧观念，所种的谷子连续两年高额丰产。
    这个大队一九六四年种植的二百一十七亩谷子，平均亩产六百五十六斤半。去年，谷子种植面积扩大到二百五十七亩（占粮田总面积百分之三十五以上），虽然遇到严重的干旱、雹、风、虫等自然灾害，有二百一十七亩平均亩产达到六百二十三斤，另外四十亩谷子的平均亩产也达到了四百斤。
    南房大队在雁门关外的草垛山下，壶流河畔。这里地势高寒，土地瘠薄，过去谷子的平均亩产量只有七八十斤。因此，多少年来，许多人总是认为谷子产量低，增产幅度小，发展前途不大，主张少种谷子。他们把迅速提高粮食产量的希望寄托在扩大玉米种植面积上，安排种植面积时，把谷子地挤得很少，而且多半是赖地。
    谷子种得少，产量低，使得南房大队在生产和生活上发生了许多矛盾。社员爱吃的小米、喂大牲畜的谷草、喂猪的谷糠都少了，集体和社员收入也受到了影响。这种情况，促使干部和社员不得不重新来认识谷子生产问题。他们认真总结了经验教训，认为一定要从全局需要和当地实际情况出发，合理安排各种农作物的种植比例；要发扬大寨精神，破除对谷子的陈旧观念，积极发展谷子生产，革掉谷子低产的命。
    为了探索谷子的高产道路，南房大队成立了有干部、老农和技术人员参加的谷子科学实验小组，由大队党支部书记刘清亲自领导；并以这个小组为核心，展开了群众性的科学实验活动。鉴定出适宜当地种植的产量高、质量好、发病少的“大白谷”、“东方亮”等七种优良品种谷子，在全大队大面积推广。
    谷子捉不住全苗，是南房大队谷子大幅度增产的难关。干部和社员在解决了谷种问题以后，决心要攻破这道难关。党支部书记刘清和老贫农社员王元善、王喜等人有一天蹲在谷地里，研究死苗的原因，他们拔起干枯了的谷苗，发现根部有个小黑点，象针刺过的一样，剥开一看，里边藏着小虫子。这时他们才懂得了谷苗是被“钻心虫”咬死的。刘清经过长期观察，摸清了钻心虫化蛹、变蛾、产卵，又孵化小虫为害谷苗等全部活动规律。在关键时刻，他们用药剂喷杀，效果很好；将“枯心苗”全部拔掉烧毁；结合秋耕烧掉谷茬，消灭越冬幼虫。这样，就保证了谷子全苗。
    这个大队还经过试验，根据水、肥等条件实行了谷子合理密植，改变了“稀谷秀大穗，一步留三苗”的老规矩。这对谷子高产起了不小作用。
    去年开春，没有下过一场透雨，墒情不好。苗子出土后，因干旱缺苗断垄十分严重。这时候，有人主张毁掉谷子，改种玉米或其它作物。党支部认为，夺取谷子高产是一场革命，决不能走回头路，一定要摸出一套抗旱增产的经验来。因此决定移苗。怕土干栽不活，就担水浇苗移栽。大家一股劲创造了全苗满垄的奇迹。入夏以后，还是没有下一场透雨，谷苗旱得厉害。他们采取了早间苗、早锄苗、早浇水等措施，与干旱进行斗争。八月下旬受了雹、风等灾害，他们又展开锄苗松土、追肥活动，把被冰雹砸倒、大风刮倒的谷子一株一株地扶起来，终于在大旱之年获得了谷子丰收。
