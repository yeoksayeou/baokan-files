    Ordinary Low-Alloy Steel
    Countries around the world generally divide steel into two major categories: carbon steel and special steel. The performance of carbon steel is adjusted by the carbon content in the steel; the performance of special steel is adjusted by valuable alloy elements, so it is also called alloy steel. Compared with carbon steel, special steel has higher strength, better plasticity, and is more resistant to corrosion and wear.
    Ordinary low-alloy steel also adjusts performance with alloy elements, but the content of alloy elements is less than that of special steel, and the quality is between that of special steel and carbon steel. The ordinary low-alloy steel that China is now developing uses other alloy elements that are extremely abundant in China and coexist with iron ore. Moreover, the production process is simpler than that of special steel, the cost is lower, and the output is large, so it can be used as widely as carbon steel. Therefore, although it is alloy steel, it is still classified as ordinary steel and called ordinary low-alloy steel.
    The ordinary low-alloy steel produced in China can replace 1.3 tons, 1.5 tons, or even 2 tons of ordinary carbon steel. Some of it can even replace some special steel.
    The development of ordinary low-alloy steel is not only a revolution in steel products, but also provides material conditions for the product revolution in other sectors of the national economy.

    普通低合金钢
    世界各国通常把钢分为炭素钢和特殊钢两大类。炭素钢以钢中的含炭量来调整性能；特殊钢以贵重合金元素来调整性能，所以又叫做合金钢。比起炭素钢来，特殊钢的强度高，塑性好，耐腐蚀，耐磨损。
    普通低合金钢，也是以合金元素来调整性能，但合金元素的含量比特殊钢少，质量介于特殊钢和炭素钢之间。我国现在发展的普通低合金钢，是使用我国资源极其丰富的跟铁矿共生的其它合金元素。并且生产工艺比特殊钢简单，成本低，产量大，可以象炭素钢那样普及使用。所以，虽然是合金钢，仍然列入普通钢范围，称为普通低合金钢。
    我国生产的普通低合金钢，一吨能顶一吨三、一吨五、甚至两吨普通炭素钢用，有一部分甚至可以代替一部分特殊钢用。
    发展普通低合金钢，不仅是钢铁产品的革命，而且对国民经济其它部门的产品革命，提供了物质条件。
