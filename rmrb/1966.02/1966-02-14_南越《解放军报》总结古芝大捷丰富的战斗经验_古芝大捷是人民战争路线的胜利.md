    Hanoi, February 12th (Xinhua News Agency) – The South Vietnamese "People's Liberation Armed Forces Newspaper" recently published a commentary pointing out that the great victory achieved by the army and people of Cu Chi District in January is a victory for the determination to defeat the American bandits, a victory for the people's war line, and a victory for the combination of mass armed struggle and political struggle.
    In the counter-"sweep" battles fought over half a month, from January 8th to 27th, the army and people of Cu Chi District shattered numerous frantic offensives by over 10,000 American aggressor troops and their accomplice armies, annihilating over 1,500 enemy soldiers, shooting down and damaging nearly 80 enemy aircraft, and destroying and damaging over 50 enemy tanks.
    This commentary detailed and reviewed the combat experience of the Cu Chi Victory. The commentary pointed out that the army and people of Cu Chi District achieved such a great victory in their first large-scale contest with the American aggressor troops and created rich combat experience. These experiences are:
    1. The army and people of Cu Chi District have the determination to strike at the American aggressor bandits and defend their homeland.
    After the American bandits and their lackeys carried out bloody "sweeps" in Ben Cat and War Zone D, which are close to Cu Chi, the army and people of Cu Chi District saw more clearly the enemy's vicious conspiracy and realized more deeply that there is only one way to protect themselves and their homeland: resolutely annihilate the American bandits. After summarizing and carefully studying the anti-"sweep" experiences of other places, they saw that fighting the Americans was not more difficult than fighting the puppet troops, thus enhancing their confidence and determination to be ready to strike at the enemy at any time with a victor's attitude.
    2. The most thorough preparations were made in terms of combat organization.
    Before the counter-"sweep," they meticulously organized the mass evacuation and transfer work; through political work, they instilled in the army and people the will to resolutely strike at and defeat the American bandits; the various units of the Liberation Armed Forces further studied the enemy's possible landing points, enemy marching routes, and search targets, and formulated combat plans; they carefully studied the coordination of the three armed forces, the coordination of military and political affairs, and the coordination of annihilating the enemy and protecting themselves; the guerrillas and the people, according to the needs of combat, further consolidated and repaired combat fortifications, added many minefields and traps, increased a large number of simple weapons, and created more ingenious tactics for striking at the enemy.
    3. With the People's Liberation Army and guerrillas as the backbone, the whole people participated in the battle.
    As soon as the enemy set foot on the land of Cu Chi, they were immediately subjected to continuous resistance from the army and people of Cu Chi. The most prominent point is that the entire population participated in the battle to annihilate the enemy. In the battle, the troops and guerrillas served as the backbone, the combat plans were very specific and meticulous, and when the enemy came, everyone had their own task and could fight independently. The broad masses of the people very calmly and bravely supported the troops and guerrillas in their operations. Everyone participating in the battle spared no effort to continuously contain, encircle, strike at, and eliminate the enemy, plunging the enemy into the sea of people's war.
    4. Armed struggle is combined with political struggle.
    In this counter-"sweep," while carrying out armed struggle against the enemy, the army and people of Cu Chi also launched a powerful political struggle. More than 2,000 people rose up and relied on the power of unity and the force of justice to carry out a heroic struggle, recovering relatives who had been captured by the enemy and property that had been looted, and limiting the losses caused by the enemy.
    5. Relying on combat villages, using simple weapons and flexible tactics, employing various forms, continuously attacking the enemy, and highly demonstrating the power of people's war.
    Wherever the enemy went, they were attacked there. They attacked not only the enemy's large units, but also a squad of enemies, even a single enemy. They fought during the day and at night, continuously and universally. They carried out ambushes, raids, and artillery bombardments, sometimes using rifles and grenades, and sometimes using mines, stakes, and traps. All this formed a tight encirclement, surrounding the enemy layer by layer. Therefore, although the American aggressor troops and their accomplice armies had various state-of-the-art equipment, their marching speed was not much faster than a turtle's, and they could not "advance" more than two kilometers a day.
    6. As long as there is determination, light weapons and simple weapons can be used to destroy enemy tanks and shoot down enemy aircraft.
    In this counter-"sweep," the army and people of Cu Chi County shot down and damaged nearly 80 enemy aircraft and destroyed and damaged over 50 enemy tanks. The achievement of this outstanding record is mainly due to the high determination of the army and people of Cu Chi to eliminate the Americans.

### 南越《解放军报》总结古芝大捷丰富的战斗经验  古芝大捷是人民战争路线的胜利

    南越《解放军报》总结古芝大捷丰富的战斗经验
    古芝大捷是人民战争路线的胜利
    据新华社河内十二日电  越南南方解放武装力量机关报《解放军报》最近发表评论指出，古芝县军民在一月份取得的大捷，是战胜美国强盗的决心的胜利，是人民战争路线的胜利，是群众性的武装斗争和政治斗争相结合的胜利。
    古芝县军民在从一月八日到二十七日的半个多月的反“扫荡”战斗中，粉碎了美国侵略军和它的帮凶军的上万兵力的多次猖狂进攻，歼灭敌军一千五百多名、打落打伤敌机近八十架、击毁击伤敌战车五十多辆。
    这篇评论详细地评述了古芝大捷的战斗经验。评论指出，古芝县军民在同美国侵略军进行的第一次大规模的较量中就取得了这样巨大的胜利，并且创造了丰富的战斗经验。这些经验是：
    一、古芝县军民具有打击美国侵略强盗和保卫家乡的决心。
    美国强盗及其走狗在同古芝靠近的边葛和D战区进行了血腥的“扫荡”以后，古芝县军民更加看清了敌人的恶毒阴谋，更加深刻地认识到，要想保卫自己和保卫家乡，只有一条路：坚决歼灭美国强盗。他们总结并认真学习了其它地方反“扫荡”的经验后看到，打美国佬并不比打伪军困难，因此增强了信心，决心以胜利者的姿态随时准备打击敌人。
    二、在战斗组织方面作好了最充分的准备。
    他们在反“扫荡”前周密地进行了群众疏散转移的组织工作；通过政治工作使军民们树立起坚决打击和战胜美国强盗的意志；解放武装力量的各个单位进一步研究了敌人可能空降着陆的地点、敌人行军路线和搜索目标等，制订了作战计划；周密地研究了三种武装力量的配合、军事同政治的配合、歼灭敌人同保卫自己的配合等问题；游击队和人民群众根据作战的需要，进一步巩固和修整了战斗工事，增设了许多地雷阵、陷阱，增加了大批简陋武器，创造出更多的打击敌人的奇妙战术。
    三、以解放军和游击队为骨干，全民参加战斗。
    当敌人刚刚踏上古芝土地的时候，就立刻遭到古芝军民的连续阻击。最突出的一点是全民都参加了歼灭敌人的战斗，在战斗中，以部队和游击队为骨干，作战计划非常具体和周密，敌人一来，每一个人都有自己的任务，都能够独立作战。广大群众非常镇定和英勇地支援部队和游击队作战。参加战斗的每个人都不惜自己的一切，来连续地牵制、包围、打击和消灭敌人，使敌人陷于人民战争的火海中。
    四、武装斗争同政治斗争相结合。
    在这次反“扫荡”中，古芝军民在对敌人进行武装斗争的同时，还同敌人展开强有力的政治斗争，两千多群众起来依靠团结的威力和正义的气势，进行了英勇的斗争，夺回了被敌人抓去的亲人和抢走的财物，限制了敌人所造成的损失。
  五、依靠战斗村，运用简陋的武器和机智灵活的战术，运用多种形式，连续打击敌人，高度发挥人民战争的威力。
    敌人走到那里，就在那里挨打，他们既打敌人的大部队，见到一个班敌人、甚至一个敌人也打。白天打，夜里也打，连续地打，普遍地打。他们进行伏击、袭击和炮击，有时用步枪、手榴弹打，有时用地雷、桩板和陷阱打，这一切，形成了一个严密的包围圈，把敌人层层围住。因此，尽管美国侵略军和它的帮凶军有着各种最新式的装备，但是，他们行军的速度并不比乌龟快多少，一天“前进”不了两公里。
    六、只要有决心，就可以用轻武器和简陋武器击毁敌人的战车和击落敌人的飞机。
    在这次反“扫荡”中，古芝县军民共打落打伤敌机近八十架，击毁击伤敌战车五十多辆。这一出色战绩的取得，主要是由于古芝军民有高度的歼美决心。
