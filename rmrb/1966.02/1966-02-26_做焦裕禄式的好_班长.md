　　Be a Good "Squad Leader" Like Jiao Yulu
    Jiao Yulu's exemplary deeds prove an undeniable truth: if the county Party committee is revolutionized, the masses will also be revolutionized. I am determined to be a revolutionized squad leader, making the county Party committee truly a revolutionized leading body.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was indeed a good squad leader. Upon arriving in Lankao County, he first focused on the ideological revolutionization of the county Party committee leadership. He organized the study of Chairman Mao's works and led by example, quickly changing the county Party committee's spiritual outlook, mobilizing everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm, and truly making the county Party committee a fighting headquarters with unified thinking, unified action, and leadership over the people of the entire county in the three great revolutionary movements. In just a few years, he basically conquered the "three harms" [waterlogging, sandstorms, and salinization] and changed the face of Lankao. This vivid example proves an undeniable truth, which is that if the county Party committee is revolutionized, the masses will also be revolutionized. With such leadership and masses, we will be invincible in socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    I was transferred from inland areas of our province to Sunke County on the frontier of the motherland in 1963. Looking back on the past three years, the overall work of the county has not improved significantly, and the backward conditions have not changed quickly. This is mainly because I, as the squad leader, failed to study Chairman Mao's works well like Comrade Jiao Yulu, realize ideological revolutionization, proactively unite and help comrades, and mobilize everyone's enthusiasm to fully utilize collective leadership. Instead, I often made arbitrary decisions, conducting "one-man shows" during Standing Committee meetings, talking more myself and allowing others to speak less, preventing comrades' wisdom from being brought into play and making them feel unhappy. Consequently, thinking was not unified, actions were not unified, leadership was weak, and morale was low in daily work, failing to form a strong leading core. In the future, I will definitely take Mao Zedong Thought as my weapon and Comrade Jiao Yulu as my example, determined to be a revolutionized squad leader, making the county Party committee truly a revolutionized leading body.

　　做焦裕禄式的好“班长”
    焦裕禄的模范事迹证明了一条千真万确的真理：县委是革命化的，群众也就会是革命化的。我决心做个革命化的班长，使县委真正成为一个革命化的领导班子
    焦裕禄同志确实是一个好班长。他到兰考县首先抓了县委领导的思想革命化。组织大学毛主席著作、以身作则，很快改变了县委的精神面貌，调动了大家的革命积极性，使县委真正成为一个思想齐、动作齐、领导全县人民进行三大革命斗争的战斗司令部。短短的几年，就基本战胜了三害，改变了兰考的面貌。这个活生生的事例，证明了一条千真万确的真理，那就是县委是革命化的，群众也就会是革命化的，有了这样的领导和群众，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，必将无往不胜。
    我是一九六三年由我省内地调到祖国边疆逊克县工作的，回忆这三年多的时间，全县工作起色不大，落后面貌改变不快，这主要是我这个当班长的没能象焦裕禄同志那样，带头学好毛主席著作，实现思想革命化，主动的团结同志、帮助同志，调动大家的积极性，充分发挥集体领导作用。而往往是独断专行，开常委会时“一言堂”，我说的多，让别人说的少，使同志们的智慧不能发挥，心情不舒畅，因而日常工作中思想不齐，动作不齐，领导无力，精神不振，没有形成一个强有力的领导核心。今后我一定以毛泽东思想为武器，以焦裕禄同志为榜样，决心做一个革命化的班长，使县委真正成为一个革命化的领导班子。
