    According to Xinhua News Agency, Manila, February 11th: More than two thousand Filipino youths and students held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines on the 11th, protesting the U.S. government's enticement of the Philippine authorities to send so-called "engineering personnel" and "security forces" to South Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism.
    Earlier that day, demonstrators, carrying signs saying "Do Not Interfere in Vietnam," demonstrated in front of the Congress, protesting the Congress's discussion of a proposal to send two thousand Filipino engineers and soldiers to South Vietnam.
    The demonstrators distributed leaflets along the way, which said that the proposal submitted to Congress was a "crime against our own people."
    An organization participating in the demonstration condemned the U.S. for launching the war of aggression against Vietnam in order to "destroy Vietnam's independence, just as it devastated our own country's independence in the 1898 Philippine-American War."
    The demonstrators also distributed a declaration, which said: "The war in Vietnam is not our war, and we do not need to participate in it, nor do we need to fight to win it." The declaration said, "If there is freedom to defend, it is our national freedom."

    抗议美国政府诱迫菲律宾当局派兵充当侵越炮灰
    马尼拉两千多青年在美国使馆前示威
    据新华社十一日讯　马尼拉消息：两千多名菲律宾青年和学生十一日在美国驻菲律宾大使馆前举行示威，抗议美国政府诱迫菲律宾当局派遣所谓“工程人员”和“治安部队”到南越去为美帝国主义充当炮灰。
    这天早些时候，示威者曾拿着“不要干涉越南”的标语牌到国会前示威，抗议国会讨论派遣两千名菲律宾工兵和军队去南越的建议。
    示威者在沿途散发传单，它说，提交国会的这项建议是“对我们本国人民犯罪”。
    参加示威的一个组织谴责美国发动侵越战争是要“摧毁越南的独立，就象在一八九八年的菲美战争中摧残了我们本国的独立那样。”
    示威者还散发宣言，宣言说：“越南的战争不是我们的战争，用不着我们参加进去，也用不着我们去打赢它。”宣言说，“如果说有自由要保卫的话，那是我们的民族自由。”
