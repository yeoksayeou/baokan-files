　　Starting with "Comparison"
　　Zhao Xiaoli, Ninth Grade Student, Beijing Jingshan School
    Ouyang Hai had a "tiger"-like vigor. This was not because he was burly and strong, with immense strength; on the contrary, he was not tall, and his body was not very strong. But he had inexhaustible energy, indomitable courage, and the determination to overcome all difficulties.
    Where did the power come from? From Mao Zedong Thought, from deep feelings for the people, from the great ideals of world revolution. It was precisely the awareness of the historical mission he shouldered that generated great spiritual power, broke through physiological limits, and he rushed to do what he could do, and tried his best to do what he could not. Swinging a sledgehammer, carrying wood, continuing to fight on the railway construction site despite suffering from severe dysentery, and working selflessly on the reservoir construction site even with burnt hands – what strong revolutionary perseverance! Ouyang Hai was no different from ordinary people in terms of physiology, but he had something that some people did not have in spirit—the revolutionary "tiger"-like vigor generated by lofty revolutionary ideals.
    In order to support the disaster area, to share the Party's worries, and to struggle against revisionism and get through the difficult days, Ouyang Hai secretly saved food grain by grain, but his revolutionary "tiger" vigor grew day by day. Which of these saved grains was not filled with Ouyang Hai's revolutionary intention? Seeing this, my tears couldn't help but roll down. In the face of such a highly conscious revolutionary fighter, what can I "compare" with? But I want to start with "comparison," find my shortcomings from "comparison," clarify my direction forward from "comparison," and draw revolutionary impetus from "comparison"!

　　从“比”开始
　　北京景山学校九年级学生　赵小丽
    欧阳海有着一身的“虎”劲。这并不在于他膀大腰粗，力大无穷；相反，他个儿不高，身体也不太强壮。但是在他身上却有着使不完的精力，压不倒的勇气，战胜一切困难的决心。
    力量打哪儿来？来自毛泽东思想，来自对人民的深厚感情，来自世界革命的远大理想。正是意识到了自己肩负的历史使命，产生了巨大的精神力量，突破了生理的限度，干得了的他抢着去干，干不了的也拼尽全力去干。抡大锤，扛木头，生着严重的痢疾依旧在铁路工地上坚持战斗，烧坏了双手仍然在水库工地上忘我劳动，这是多么坚强的革命毅力呵！欧阳海在生理上跟普通人一样，并没有什么特殊的地方，然而在精神上却有着一些人所没有的东西——远大的革命理想所产生的革命“虎”劲。
    为了支援灾区，给党分忧，为了跟修正主义斗争，熬过困难的日子，欧阳海瞒着同志，一口一口地节约着粮食，可是革命的“虎”劲却一天比一天大。这节约下来的一颗颗粮食，哪一颗不充满着欧阳海革命的心意？看到这里，我的眼泪不禁滚滚落下。在这样高度自觉的革命战士面前，我还能“比”什么呢？但是我要从“比”开始，从“比”里找出自己的不足，从“比”里明确自己前进的方向，从“比”里汲取革命的动力！
