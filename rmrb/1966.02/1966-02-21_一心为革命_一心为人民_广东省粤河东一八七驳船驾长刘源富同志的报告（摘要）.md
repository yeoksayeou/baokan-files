　　According to Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: Liu Yuanfu, a representative of national advanced figures in industry and transportation, a model worker in water transport, and captain of the Guangdong Yuehe Dong 187 barge, delivered a report entitled "Single-Mindedly for the Revolution, Single-Mindedly for the People" at the expanded meeting of the National Industrial and Transportation Work Conference and the National Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference. The abstract is as follows:

    Editor's Note: From Comrade Liu Yuanfu's speech, we can see that an ordinary worker, having established a sense of ownership of the country and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, can accomplish extraordinary things for the country and the people in an ordinary position.

    The thought of being the master of the country is the same as being single-mindedly for the revolution and single-mindedly for the people, taking the world as one's own responsibility. "The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen" could only be empty words in the era when the people did not have their own way. After liberation, the people completely turned themselves over and became the masters of the country; armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they became conscious masters of the country. For us, these are two revolutions in thinking.

    Why did Comrade Liu Yuanfu work so selflessly after liberation? Why did he cherish every plant and tree of the country so much? Why did he do so well in his job, and why was he able to take risks and overcome difficulties in things outside his job, doing so well as far as he could? This is because he has changed from a slave in the old society to a master of the new China, and he has realized and fulfilled his responsibility to the country and the people. From slave to conscious master, this is a revolution in Comrade Liu Yuanfu's thinking.

    In recent years, why has Comrade Liu Yuanfu become so strong and so conscious? Why does he not only work so well, but also lead so well? This is because he strives to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, constantly drawing strength and wisdom from the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. From an ordinary worker to a conscious revolutionary, this is another revolution in Comrade Liu Yuanfu's thinking.

    Mao Zedong Thought is the highest instruction for all our work. We should more consciously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, constantly transform ourselves, and promote the continuous revolution of our thinking.

    My family is a waterborne family, making a living by fishing, and suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation in the old society. I had ten siblings, and due to the pressure of life, two older sisters were sold to others as child brides, and two older brothers and two younger brothers starved to death. My father suffered from paralysis because he worked in the water for many years, and he was forced to death by the fishing tyrant in a few years. At that time, we were still young and depended on my mother to fish for a living. We often relied on picking wild vegetables to satisfy our hunger. When we couldn't stand the hunger, we went to beg for food. At the age of fourteen, I learned to fish. I couldn't catch a few pounds of fish after a hard day, but the fishing tyrant insisted on buying it for three cents a pound. At the age of eighteen, I helped others punt boats, and twice encountered bandits robbing the boat, tying me to a banyan tree and beating me to death. In the old society, there was really no way for us poor people to survive. When I think of the past, I hate those landlords and bullies, hate the Kuomintang reactionaries, and hate the American imperialists. These bad things are the deadly enemies of our poor people. The more I think about it, the more I love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, my family would have died out long ago! Chairman Mao and the Communist Party want me to go up the mountain of knives and down into the sea of fire, and I am willing to do so.

    All work is not only for the Chinese revolution, but also for the complete liberation of the working people of the whole world.

    Not long after liberation, the comrades of the work team brought a bag of rice to my home, which made me very grateful. But at that time, I only knew that the people's government was good to the poor, and I didn't understand the principles of revolution. Later, I participated in the waterborne bandit suppression and anti-hegemony struggle, and was elected as the village head of the waterborne village. I fought against those bullies with the masses, and I understood a little about the principles of revolution, and I truly realized that the poor people had turned themselves over to be the masters.

    In 1956, the superiors sent me to serve as the captain of the Yuehe Dong 187 boat. This was a wooden barge with a load capacity of more than 20 tons. There were four crew members on the boat. In addition to myself, one was my wife, and the other two were my older brother and sister-in-law. My older brother was deaf and lame, so in reality, there were only three laborers. Later, we were organized into groups and teams. Another boat and my boat were formed into a group, and I became the group leader. At that time, my class consciousness was still low, and I just wanted to desperately do a good job in production to repay Chairman Mao and the Party's kindness, and not to let down the Party's trust in me. Our few people, with concerted efforts, safely and with high quality completed the production tasks year after year. In 1963, I attended the advanced worker conference, and the instructions and calls of the superiors greatly educated me. Last year, I attended the provincial "Five Goods" and advanced worker representatives conference. After the meeting, I responded to the call and more earnestly read Chairman Mao's books. In November, I also studied Comrade Wang Jie's diary. After reading Chairman Mao's books, my heart became clearer and my eyes became brighter. In the past, I only knew that I had to repay Chairman Mao and the Party's kindness, which was not enough. Now I realize that all work is to serve the people, all is for the revolution, not only for the Chinese revolution, but also for the complete liberation of the working people of the whole world.

    Revolution cannot be afraid of difficulties or dangers! What if there are difficulties or dangers? The method is struggle.

    I manage a small wooden barge, without a fixed tugboat to tow it. Traveling in the Dongjiang River, which has many bays and dangerous shoals, we often encounter strong winds and rapid waves. Should we wait if the tugboat is late? Should we go if we encounter strong winds and rapid waves? This is a big question. I think that production is struggle, is revolution, and revolution cannot be afraid of difficulties or dangers! What if there are difficulties or dangers? The method is struggle. My determination is: where I am, there is a boat; where there is a boat, there are goods. I cannot let the state property be lost in vain.

    Once, I punted a boat to Huizhou. When the boat reached Tantoujiao, it suddenly encountered a rapid current head-on. It was too late to turn the boat around, and it looked like the boat was about to hit the rocks. In this critical moment, I hurriedly threw the anchor down, but it didn't work at all. The boat dragged the anchor and still rushed towards the rocks. At this time, I couldn't care about anything else. I picked up the rattan basket and jumped into the water, rushed ahead of the waves, and swam desperately towards the rocks. Approaching the rocks, I quickly leaned against the rocks, clamped the rattan basket with my two feet, and waited for the boat to rush over. Then there was a loud crash. The boat rushed onto the rattan basket. Because the rattan basket served as a buffer, the boat was not broken, and both the boat and the goods were saved. Thinking about it now, the situation was indeed extremely critical. If I had made the decision a little slower, and moved my hands and feet a little slower, the boat would have caught up and either smashed me to pieces or flattened me. What was I thinking at the time? Nothing else. The heroic deeds of Huang Jiguang and Dong Cunrui and the revolutionary spirit of not fearing sacrifice encouraged me.

    In the winter of 1964, the boat went to Shilong. When it reached "Golden Armchair," a strong northerly wind blew up, and it was necessary to stop sailing immediately, but the anchor was not stable, and the boat was shaking violently. It looked like it was about to capsize! I hurriedly jumped into the water, carried the big anchor on my back, and crawled dozens of meters on the bottom of the water, which was more than ten feet deep, until I put the anchor firmly in place, and only then did I avoid this danger.

    As for the people's property, even a blade of grass or a tree should be cherished.

    Sometimes, some people say to me: "Liu Yuanfu, why do you cherish state property so much, and love the boat so much?" I thought about it carefully, and I am really not qualified for such high praise. But, as for the people's property, even a blade of grass or a tree should be cherished. For example, when I am asked to release and transport timber rafts, I have to check the number of timbers. If one is missing, I must find a way to get it back. I think that if one timber is missing, I have not completed the task assigned to me by the Party. I really can't stand those people who lose a chick themselves and look for it from the east village to the west village, but are indifferent when they see the property of the state and the people being lost. I think this kind of person is too unconscious, and has the bourgeois selfish and self-interested thoughts. We must resolutely struggle against this kind of person.

    During the voyage, when I see that the sugarcane of the peasant brothers has fallen into the river, I feel uncomfortable if I don't get it back. Even in winter, I have to help get it back. Once, I salvaged two tons of sugarcane for the farmers, and the commune members praised me as "a good crew member taught by Chairman Mao." I couldn't calm down for a long time after hearing this. I want to truly be a good crew member of Chairman Mao. Another time, I saw that the wooden boards of the shipyard were blown away by the wind, and they were floating all over the river. I and all the crew members went into the water to salvage the wooden boards, from two o'clock in the afternoon until late at night, before we salvaged them all back. The comrades of the shipyard were very grateful to us. I said that this should be thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao's teachings.

    It is common for boats to lose anchors during voyages. No matter whose it is, when I see it, I feel distressed if I don't salvage it. In the past few years, I have salvaged more than 20 iron anchors for other boats. If there is an owner, I will return it to the owner. If there is no owner, I will hand it over to the public. Someone once encouraged me and said: "Your child is sick, and the public will give you a subsidy, but you don't want it. If you sell an ownerless anchor that you picked up, you can get dozens of yuan. Anyway, you picked it up yourself, so it doesn't matter if you sell it." I said: "I won't do this kind of thing for personal gain." I think that if I sell the anchor, then what I sell is not the anchor, but the noble character of our working class. This kind of thing must never be done.

    I am determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, specially pick heavy burdens to carry, and be a good comrade in the revolutionary ranks.

    Since liberation, there have been three things that have moved me the most: The first is that the fishing tyrant was overthrown, and the fishermen turned themselves over; the second is that the Party and the government are single-mindedly for the people, the country is becoming richer and stronger day by day, and the people's lives are stable; the third is that every time a meeting is held, when the leaders meet me, they kindly call me "Comrade Liu Yuanfu." In the face of these living facts, how can my heart not be excited? How can I not do my best to carry heavy burdens for the socialist revolution and socialist construction? Speaking of carrying heavy burdens, I also thought of such a thing: One day, I heard a cadre read Chairman Mao's quotations. Chairman Mao said: "... Pick the heavy burdens to carry, endure hardships before others, and enjoy after others. Such comrades are good comrades." I felt that Chairman Mao said it really well. When I returned home, I asked my son to read this passage to me again and again. I am determined to keep Chairman Mao's words firmly in my heart, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, specially pick heavy burdens to carry, and be a good comrade in the revolutionary ranks.

    Originally, the wooden barges here were unwilling to tow timber rafts, thinking that it was an extra burden. At this time, I was very anxious when I saw that the timber could not be transported out, so I tried to tow timber rafts with wooden barges. The load capacity of our boat is more than 20 tons. Now, in addition to its own load, two boats can tow 500 cubic meters of timber.

    In March of 1965, during the busy farming season, our boat was teamed up with the 136 boat to transport ore, preparing to go to Huizhou. When I was about to leave with the shipping list, I heard that there was a batch of large wood on the dock, which the shipyard needed urgently, and needed to be transported to Huizhou immediately, but unfortunately, it happened to be a strong wind and heavy rain, with big water and rapid waves. The four captains stood in front of the dispatcher and could not do anything. The skilled rafters did not dare to release the shipment. At this time, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings. I must carry this heavy burden. I immediately made a request and said: "Give it to me! I will tow it to Huizhou." I first explained to the crew the significance of urgently transporting this batch of timber, and then explained to them the principle of being brave enough to carry heavy burdens, and also analyzed the weather and water conditions at that time. Everyone agreed with my opinion and came up with several methods for transporting goods and towing timber. During the voyage, the boat ran aground several times, encountered danger several times, and anchored overnight several times. I took the lead in going into the water and completed the task victoriously with all the crew members.

    In February last year, the five cooling water pipes of the Huiyang Sugar Factory were blocked by debris. These five large pipes were buried in the water more than eighteen feet deep. The flow velocity of the water here is very high, and the suction force of the water pipes is also very high. If people go down to poke the pipes, they will be stuck in the pipes if they are sucked in. My boat was passing by here at that time, and I saw many people gathered together, saying one thing or another, and could not think of a way. I heard a cadre from the sugar factory say: "If it is not dredged in time, the whole factory will have to stop production. If it stops for a day, the state will lose 60,000 yuan, and more than 1,000 tons of sugarcane cannot be squeezed, and more than 100 boats cannot be unloaded." These words moved my heart. I thought, if I don't carry this heavy burden, who will? Even if there is a danger to my life, I must never watch the state property being lost. So I made up my mind and jumped into the water. I exerted all my strength, endured the bone-chilling cold, and kept drilling down, found the water pipe, held the pipe with my left hand to stabilize my body, and used my right hand to dig out the debris. I dug and dug, and suddenly felt a force sucking me forward. Fortunately, I leaned to the side of the pipe along the force and avoided the water force, so I was not sucked into the water pipe. After more than 20 dives, and continuous persistence in the underwater battle for more than 30 minutes, the obstacles in the water pipes were finally completely removed, ensuring the normal operation of the sugar factory's production. When I left the water after completing the task, my whole body was numb, my ears were buzzing, and I was unable to move. The worker brothers helped me ashore. Some brought soup, some brought fire, some wiped water, and some put on clothes. All the workers in the factory cheered for my victory. The responsible comrades of the sugar factory also brought a pile of condolence gifts and a sum of remuneration to thank me. I accepted the warm feelings of the worker comrades and declined all remuneration. I said: It's okay if the water pipes are clear. It's my duty to rescue state property.

    I will never forget the kindness of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. I will listen to Chairman Mao's words and serve the people wholeheartedly.

    After liberation, my mother, who had suffered all her life, often said to me with tears in her eyes as soon as she picked up the rice bowl: "You must never forget your roots, never forget how you turned yourself over, and be worthy of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Think before and after, compare your heart with your heart, and do good things for the poor." These words of my mother often lingered in my heart. I will never forget the kindness of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. I will listen to Chairman Mao's words and serve the people wholeheartedly. We people who live on the water often encounter things like adults and children falling into the water. Whether the boat is at the dock or sailing in rapid currents, whether it is day or night, as long as someone falls into the water, I always try my best to rescue them. In the past ten years, I have successively rescued ten workers and farmers, and seven children of dock workers and water transport workers in ten places, plus more than 20 people who were rescued incidentally.

    One day at noon, our boat was docked in Guzhu Town. I was on the shore when I suddenly heard someone falling into the water and calling for help. Looking back, it turned out to be a young woman who went to the river to fetch water, was swept into the bottom of the boat by a whirlpool, and was quickly washed far away from the dock by the rapid current. At this time, I was standing on a cliff more than ten feet high. I didn't have time to find a road, so I jumped into the water, injured my waist by the rocks, and broke my heel. I endured the severe pain and finally rescued the woman from the bottom of the water. The woman's parents said that I was their savior. I said: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors. My family was saved by the Communist Party."

    One winter, at twelve o'clock in the middle of the night, it was windy and rainy, and the cold was piercing. At this time, on the surface of the Guanyinge River in Boluo, three young men who were rafting were blown into the water by a strong wind and rapid waves. One person was holding a bamboo that had been scattered, and was tumbling in the water. As soon as I heard someone calling for help, I immediately drove a small boat to chase after them on the river. In that dark night, I searched many places along the river, and with great effort, I finally rescued them one by one into the boat. Their parents and township cadres thanked me and wanted to give me remuneration. I resolutely refused, so they sent me pennants with gongs and drums. I still said to them, thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's kindness, no need to thank me.

    Chairman Mao's works are like the rudder on our boat, and the navigation marks in the river channel. With it, we will not lose our way during navigation, and we will be able to avoid one hidden reef after another.

    In September last year, I participated in the provincial conference of "Five Goods" workers and advanced figures. At the meeting, I was elected to participate in the presidium of the conference, and I was also invited to watch the ceremony on the viewing platform on National Day. This is something I never dreamed of in the past. I only did a little bit for the people, but the Party and the people gave me such a great honor, which really moved me so much that I didn't know what to say. At this meeting, I heard the introduction of many advanced deeds, which greatly educated me. My outstanding feeling is: to make revolution, we must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. After this meeting, I immediately organized all the crew members and

　　广东省粤河东一八七驳船驾长刘源富同志的报告（摘要）
　　据新华社二十日讯　全国工业交通先进人物代表、水上运输标兵、广东省粤河东一八七驳船驾长刘源富，十八日在全国工业交通工作会议、全国工业交通政治工作会议扩大会议上作了题为《一心为革命一心为人民》的报告，摘要如下：
    编者按：从刘源富同志的这个发言中，我们看到，一个普通工人，树立了国家主人翁思想，用毛泽东思想武装起来，能够在平凡的岗位上，为国家、为人民做出多么不平凡的事情。
    国家主人翁思想，也就是一心为革命、一心为人民，以天下为己任的思想。“国家兴亡，匹夫有责”，在人民没有当家作主的时代，只能是一句空话。解放以后，人民彻底翻身了，成为国家主人翁；用毛泽东思想武装起来，成为自觉的国家主人翁。对我们来说，这是思想上的两个革命。
    刘源富同志在解放以后，为什么那样奋不顾身地工作呢？为什么那样爱护国家的一草一木呢？为什么本职以内的事情做得那么好，本职以外的事情，凡是力所能及的，也能冒险犯难，做得那么好呢？这是因为他由旧社会的奴隶变成了新中国的主人，他意识到、尽到了对国家、对人民的责任。从奴隶到自觉的主人，这是刘源富同志思想上的一个革命。
    刘源富同志近几年来，为什么又变得那样坚强、那样自觉呢？为什么不仅劳动得那样好，领导得也那样好呢？这是因为他努力活学活用毛泽东思想，不断从毛泽东同志著作中吸取力量和智慧。从一个普通劳动者到一个自觉革命者，这是刘源富同志思想上的又一个革命。
    毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的最高指示。我们应该更自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，不断自我改造，促进我们思想不断革命。
    我家是水上人家，靠打鱼过日子，在旧社会受尽了压迫和剥削。我有十个兄弟姊妹，因生活所迫，两个姐姐卖给人家做了童养媳，两个哥哥和两个弟弟活活饿死了。我的爸爸因为长年泡在水里劳动，得了瘫痪病，不几年就被渔霸逼死了。那时我们还小，靠妈妈一个人打鱼过活，常年靠摘野菜充饥，饿得实在顶不住，就去讨饭。十四岁时，我学会了打鱼，辛苦一天打不到几斤鱼，可渔霸硬要用三分钱一斤买去。十八岁时，我帮人撑船，又两次遇到土匪劫船，把我绑在榕树上，打得死去活来。旧社会实在没有我们穷人的活路。我一想起过去的事情，就恨死那些地主恶霸，恨死国民党反动派，恨死美帝国主义。这些坏东西都是我们穷人的死对头。我越想就越热爱毛主席和共产党。不是毛主席、共产党我的一家早死绝了！毛主席和共产党要我上刀山、下火海我都心甘情愿。
    一切工作不但是为中国革命，而且是为全世界劳动人民的彻底解放。
    刚解放不久，工作队的同志给我家里背来一袋米，使我感激不尽。但是那时我只知道人民政府对穷人好，还不懂得革命的道理。后来我参加了水上清匪反霸斗争，当选为水上村村长，跟群众一起斗倒了那些作威作福的坏蛋，我才懂得了一点革命的道理，才真正体会到穷人翻身作主了。
    一九五六年上级派我担任粤河东一八七船驾长。这是一条木驳船，载重二十几吨，船上四个船员，除我自己外，一个是我的老婆，另两个是我的哥哥和嫂嫂，哥哥耳聋脚跛，实际上只有三个劳动力。后来编组编队，另外一个船和我这个船编成一个组，我当组长。那时候，我的阶级觉悟还低，就只想拼命搞好生产，来报答毛主席和党的恩情，不辜负党对我的信任。我们几个人，齐心合力，年年安全优质地完成了生产任务。一九六三年，我参加先进职工会议，听了上级的指示和号召，对我教育很大。去年又出席全省五好和先进职工代表大会，会后我响应号召，更认真地读毛主席的书，十一月又学习了王杰同志的日记。读了毛主席的书，我的心越来越明，眼越来越亮。过去我只知道要报答毛主席和党的恩情，这是不够的。现在我认识到了，一切工作都是为人民服务，都是为了革命，不但是为中国革命，而且是为全世界劳动人民的彻底解放。
    革命就不能怕困难，不能怕危险！有了困难、危险怎么办？办法就是斗争。
    我管的是条小木驳船，没有固定的拖轮来拖，在湾多滩险的东江行船，常常会遇到狂风急浪。拖轮来迟了等不等？遇到狂风急浪走不走？这是一个大问题。我认为，生产就是斗争，就是革命，革命就不能怕困难，不能怕危险！有了困难、危险怎么办？办法就是斗争。我的决心是：有我就有船，有船就有货。我不能白白让国家财产受到损失。
    有一回，我撑船去惠州，船到潭头角，突然遇到一股急流迎头冲来，船要掉头已来不及，眼看船就要撞到岩石上。在这危急的关头，我急忙把锚抛下去，可是一点也不顶事，船拖着锚还是往岩石上冲去。这时我一切都顾不了，抱起藤篓就跳下水，赶在浪头的前面，拼命向岩石游过去，游近岩石，我就赶紧靠在岩石上，用两个脚夹住藤篓，等船冲过来。接着就是哗啦一声，船冲到藤篓上，因为有藤篓作缓冲，船没有被撞破，既救了船，又救了货。现在想起来，当时的情况确实是万分危急的，如果决心下慢一点，手脚缓一缓，船追了上来，不把我撞碎，也会把我撞扁。我当时是怎样想的呢？没有别的，是黄继光、董存瑞的英雄事迹和不怕牺牲的革命精神鼓舞了我。
    一九六四年冬天，船去石龙，行至“金交椅”时，刮起了大北风，需要马上停航，可是锚下不稳，船摇晃得厉害，眼看就要翻船啦！我急忙跳下水去，背着大锚，在一丈多深的水底爬行了几十米，一直把锚放好抓实了，才避过了这场危险。
    对人民的财产，那怕是一草一木，都应该是爱护的。
    有时，有的人对我说：“刘源富，你为什么这样爱护国家财产，这样爱船如命。”我细想，把我提得这样高，实在还不够这个格。但是，对人民的财产那怕是一草一木，都应该是爱护的。譬如说，叫我放运木排吧，多少根木材，我是要查点一番的，短少了一根一定要设法找回来。我认为，少了一根木材，就没有完成党交给我的任务。我对于那些自己丢了一只小鸡，还东村找西村，而见到国家人民财产受损失，却满不在乎的人，实在看不惯。我认为这种人太没有觉悟，是资产阶级自私自利的思想。对这种人要狠狠地同他们斗争。
    在航行中，当我看见农民兄弟的甘蔗有一根掉在河里，不捞起来，心里就不舒服。那怕是冬天，也要帮助给捞起来。有一次，我为农民捞起了两吨甘蔗，社员称赞我是“毛主席教导出来的好船员”，我听了心里很久不能平静，我要真正做个毛主席的好船员。又有一次，看到船厂的木板被风刮走，漂的满河都是，我就和全船职工下水捞木板，由下午二点一直干到深夜，才全部捞了回来。船厂的同志对我们感谢不尽。我说这应该感谢党和毛主席的教导。
    船只在航行中丢锚是常有的事，不管是谁的，当我见到了，不去捞起来就心疼。几年来我一共为别的船只捞起铁锚二十多件，有主人的归还原主，无主的就交公。曾经有人怂恿我说：“你的小孩有病，公家给补助你又不要，你把拣来的无主锚卖一个得几十块钱，反正是自己拣来的，卖掉也算不了什么。”我说：“为了个人得点便宜，去干这种事，我不干。”我想，如果把锚卖掉，那就卖掉的不是锚，而是我们工人阶级的高尚品德，这种事可千万不能干。
    我下决心按照毛主席的指示，专拣重担子挑，在革命队伍中做一个好同志。
    解放以来，有三件事最使我受感动：第一件是把渔霸斗倒了，渔民翻了身；第二件是党和政府一心为人民，国家一天天富强，人民生活安定；第三件是每次开会，首长接见时，都亲切地称我为“刘源富同志”。在这些活生生的事实面前，我内心哪能不激动呢？哪能不使尽我的一切力量为社会主义革命和社会主义建设挑重担子呢？说起挑重担子，还想到这样一件事：有一天，我听干部读毛主席的语录，毛主席说：“……担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。”我觉得毛主席说得实在太好了。回到家里，又叫儿子把这段话给我念了一遍又一遍。我下决心要把毛主席的话牢牢地记在心里，按照毛主席的指示专拣重担子挑，在革命队伍中做一个好同志。
    原来，这里的木驳船都不愿拖带木排，认为是额外负担。这时候，我看到木材运不出去，心里很着急，就试着用木驳船拖木排。我们的这条船载重量是二十多吨，现在，除本身载重外，两条船就能拖五百立方米木材。
    一九六五年农忙的三月，我们的船跟一三六船合组运载矿石，准备去惠州，当我拿着货单要走时，听说码头上有一批大木头，船厂需用很急，需要马上运惠州，可是不凑巧，正碰上大风、大雨，水大浪急，四个船的驾长，站在调度员的跟前，都没有办法，熟练的排工也不敢放运。这时我想起了毛主席的教导，这个重担子我一定要挑，马上提出要求说：“给我！我拖到惠州去。”我首先向职工说明了急运这批木材的意义，又向他们解释了勇于挑重担的道理，并且还分析了当时的天气和水情。大家同意了我的意见，想出了好几个运货又拖木材的方法。船在航行中，几次搁浅，几次遇险，几次夜泊抛锚，我都带头下水，同全体船工一起胜利地完成了任务。
    去年二月，惠阳糖厂的五条冷却水管被杂物堵住了。这五条大管埋在一丈八尺多深的水底下，这里水的流速很大，水管的吸力也很大，人下去捅管子，如果被吸住了，就会卡死在管子里。我的船当时正从这里经过，看见很多人围在一起，你一言，我一语，想不出办法来。我听糖厂的一个干部说：“如果不及时疏通，全厂就要停止生产。停一天，国家要损失六万块钱，一千多吨甘蔗不能榨，一百多条船不能卸载。”这些话打动了我的心。我想这副重担子我不挑谁来挑呢？即使有生命危险，也绝不能眼看着国家财产受损失。于是我决心一下，就跳下水去。我拼了全身的力气，忍受住刺骨的寒冷，一直往下钻，找到了水管，左手抱着管子稳住身体，右手掏拉杂物，掏呀掏的，突然感到一股力量把我往前吸，幸得我顺劲向管旁一偏，避开了水势，才没有被水管吸住。经过二十多次潜下浮上，连续坚持了三十多分钟的水底战斗，终于将水管的障碍物全部排除，保证了糖厂生产的正常进行。当我完成任务离开水面时，全身麻木，两耳嗡鸣，无力动弹。工人兄弟把我搀上岸后，有的端汤，有的端火，有的擦水，有的披衣，全厂工人都为我胜利欢呼，糖厂的负责同志还拿来一堆慰问品和一笔酬款，前来向我道谢。我接受了工人同志们温暖的情谊，谢绝了一切酬劳。我说：水管通了就成，抢救国家财产是我的本份。
    毛主席、共产党的恩情我永远也忘不了，我要听毛主席的话，全心全意为人民服务。
    解放后，受了一辈子苦难的母亲，常常一端起饭碗就一字一泪地对我说：“你永远不要忘本，不要忘记自己是怎样翻身的，要对得起共产党和毛主席，要想前想后，将心比心，要为穷苦人办好事。”母亲的这些话，常常在我心里打转。毛主席、共产党的恩情我永远也忘不了，我要听毛主席的话，全心全意为人民服务。我们生活在水上的人，常常会遇到大人、小孩落水的事情。不论是船在码头还是在急流中航行，不管是白天还是黑夜，只要有人落水，我总是千方百计地抢救。十多年来，我先后在十个地方救起了工人和农民十名，码头工人和水运工人的小孩七名，加上顺手救起的共二十多人。
    有一天中午，我们船靠在古竹镇，我正在岸上时，忽然听见有人落水呼救，掉头一看，原来是一位去河边担水的青年妇女，被漩涡卷进了船底，很快就被急流冲离码头很远了。这时我站在一丈多高的悬岩上，来不及找路，就纵身跳水，被岩石擦伤了腰部，撞破了脚跟，我忍受住剧痛，终于把那位妇女从水底下救上岸来。那妇女的父母说我是救命恩人。我说：“共产党和毛主席才是救命恩人，我的一家都是共产党救活的。”
    有一年的冬天，深夜十二点钟，又是风，又是雨，寒气刺骨。就在这个时候，在博罗观音阁河的河面上，有三个架筏子的青年被一阵强风急浪打到水里，一个人抱着一根被打散了的竹子，在水里翻腾。当我一听到有人喊救命，马上就驾起小艇向江心追去。在那漆黑的夜晚，顺江找了很多地方，费了九牛二虎之力，才把他们一个个救上艇来。他们的父母和乡干部都向我道谢，还要给我酬劳。我坚决不要，他们就敲锣打鼓地给我送锦旗。我还是对他们这样说，要感谢共产党和毛主席的恩情，不必感谢我。
    毛主席的著作就好象我们船上的舵，是河道中的航标，有了它，在航行中就不会迷失方向，就能躲过一个又一个暗礁。
    去年九月，我参加全省五好职工和先进人物代表大会，会上推选我参加大会主席团，在国庆节还请我在观礼台上观礼。这是我过去做梦也没有想到的。我只给人民做了一点点事情，党和人民却给了我这么大的荣誉，真叫我感动得不知说什么好。在这个会上，我听到许多先进事迹的介绍，对我有很大教育。我突出的感觉是：要革命，就必须读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事。这次会以后，我回去马上就组织全船职工和家属学习毛主席著作，光是《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》三篇文章就学了好多遍，我们每天坚持学，船靠码头时学，开航时也学，集体学，个别学，越学心里越亮堂，越学干劲越大。毛主席的著作就好象我们船上的舵，是河道中的航标，有了它，在航行中就不会迷失方向，就能躲过一个又一个暗礁，大风大浪顶得住，什么困难也吓不倒。我们八名船工，学习毛主席著作后，个个干劲十足，过去不敢做的事，现在都抢着干。
    今后，我决心活学活用毛主席著作，一心为革命，一心为人民。手拿竹篙，脚踏船板，心怀祖国，放眼世界，搞好运输，为建设社会主义祖国、打败美帝、支援世界革命贡献自己的一切力量。　（文中插题是本报编者加的）
