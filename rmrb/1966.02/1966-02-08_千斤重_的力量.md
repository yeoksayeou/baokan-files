    The Strength of "A Thousand Catties" of Feeling
    Xiang Qian
    Two boys in their teens were playing in the water together, and one accidentally pushed the other into the water, causing him to drown. If this happened to us, how should we deal with it? – Before reading the newsletter “Class Feeling Weighs a Thousand Catties,” the members of Fangcun Brigade in Luancheng County discussed this question. In the discussion, they proposed four ways to handle it: the parents of the boy who pushed the other into the water would bear all the funeral expenses for the deceased; the boy who pushed the other into the water would be adopted by the deceased's parents to provide for their old age and burial; they would accompany the spirit of the deceased and wear mourning clothes; a life for a life. After reading "Class Feeling Weighs a Thousand Catties," many people said excitedly, "We judged this manslaughter case incorrectly!"
    When Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan dealt with their son's manslaughter case, they did not revolve around flesh and blood or providing for their old age; their minds were so broad, and their spiritual realm was so lofty. They prioritized class unity and revolutionary interests, "placing class feeling above the feeling for their own flesh and blood." "Master Mei is our class brother, a revolutionary comrade, how can we not emphasize unity!" "If we don't restrain our grief and make a fuss... what good would that do for the revolution?" This is how Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan considered the problem. As the saying goes, "The person involved is muddled, the bystander is clear." This saying does not apply to the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought. With a class in their hearts and the word "revolution" in their minds, even when faced with such a major event as manslaughter, being in the position of the "person involved," they are still "clear" and able to handle it correctly.
    Among our class brothers, such things as one's own child being accidentally pushed into the water and drowning by another child are, of course, rare. But small disputes, such as children quarreling or squabbles about dogs and cats, happen frequently. How should we deal with these small disputes in daily life? Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan have set a shining example for us. If we could all be like Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan, prioritizing class unity and revolutionary interests, then these trivial matters would truly be "threading tofu with a horse's tail – you can't lift them up!"
    Such moving deeds as in "Class Feeling Weighs a Thousand Catties" can only appear in socialist today, only in the body of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Once widely disseminated, this moving story will generate the strength of "a thousand catties" among the masses: It enhances people's class feeling, it expands people's minds and hearts, it elevates people's spiritual realm, it enables people to understand how to correctly handle the relationships between class brothers! The enhanced understanding and resolution of mutual disputes, and the strengthening of class unity, by the members of Fangcun Brigade after reading this newsletter; as well as the strong reactions this event has aroused in many factories, shops, troops, schools, neighborhoods, are all proof of this.

    “千斤重”的力量
    向前
    两个十多岁的男孩子一块儿玩水，一个孩子失手把另一个孩子推进水里淹死了。这件事，如果发生在咱们自己头上，该怎么对待呢？——栾城县方村大队的社员们，在没有读《阶级感情千斤重》这篇通讯以前，讨论了这个问题。大家在讨论中提出了四种处理办法：由推人下水的孩子的父母为死者承担全部安葬费用，把推人下水的孩子，过继给死者的父母养老送终，给死者陪灵戴孝，偿命。读了《阶级感情千斤重》以后，许多人激动地说：“这个人命案，咱断错了！”
    张永安、程春兰在处理自己儿子的人命案时，根本没有在骨肉之情和养老送终这些圈子里打转转，他们的胸怀是那么的宽广，精神境界是那么的崇高。他们以阶级团结为重，以革命利益为重，“把阶级感情放在骨肉感情之上”。“梅师傅是我们的阶级兄弟，是革命同志，我们怎能不讲团结！”“要是我们不忍住悲痛，去瞎胡闹……这对革命有什么好处呢？”张永安、程春兰就是这样考虑问题的。俗话说：“当局者迷，旁观者清。”这句话对毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级是不适用的。胸中装着一个阶级，心中怀着革命二字，即使碰着这样的人命大事，处在“当局者”的地位，也还是“清”的，能够正确地加以处理。
    在我们阶级兄弟之间，自己的孩子被别人的孩子失手推下水淹死这样的事情，当然是很少碰到的，但是什么孩子吵架，狗呀猫呀的这类小纠纷却是经常会发生的。应当怎样对待这些日常生活中的小纠纷呢？张永安、程春兰为我们树立了光辉的榜样。如果我们都能象张永安、程春兰那样，以阶级团结为重，以革命利益为重，这些芝麻绿豆、鸡毛蒜皮的事情，那就实在是“马尾穿豆腐——提不得啦”！
    《阶级感情千斤重》这样的感人事迹，只有在社会主义的今天，只有在毛泽东思想武装起来的人的身上，才能够出现。这种感人的故事一经广泛传播，就会在群众中产生“千斤重”的力量：它增强人们的阶级感情，它扩大人们的胸襟怀抱，它提高人们的精神境界，它使人们懂得如何正确处理阶级兄弟之间的关系！方村大队的社员们读了这篇通讯以后，提高了认识，解决了相互之间的一些纠纷，加强了阶级团结；以及这件事情在许多工厂、商店、部队、学校、里弄中所激起的强烈反应，就都是证明。
