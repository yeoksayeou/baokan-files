    Revolutionary Spirit Can Be Transformed into Tremendous Material Force

    From matter to matter, matter is finite; from spirit to matter, matter is infinite. Arming cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary thought and revolutionary spirit can be transformed into a tremendous material force.

    The human factor is primary. People, as long as they have revolutionary spirit, can transform the world and create social material wealth. We had some understanding of this in the past, but our understanding was not deep, and we did not apply it well in our actual work. Last year, we re-studied Chairman Mao's expositions on bringing into play the subjective initiative of people and the transformation of spirit into matter, and guided our actual work, which has achieved very good results.

    Agricultural production in Binhai County has always been low and unstable. The county has an average of nearly two mu of cultivated land per person, but it cannot be self-sufficient in grain and needs a large amount of supply from the state every year. The county has a lot of wasteland and land suitable for growing firewood and trees, but it cannot be self-sufficient in firewood and needs the state to supply coal every year. The county's natural resources are very rich, and there are broad avenues for developing diversified operations, but the production and living funds cannot be solved. Why has this situation been slow to change?

    We studied Chairman Mao's works repeatedly with this question in mind. Chairman Mao taught us: "The fundamental cause of the development of things is not external but internal, residing in the contradictoriness within the thing." Chairman Mao also said: "... we must recognize the reaction of spiritual things, the reaction of social consciousness to social existence." Listening to Chairman Mao's teachings and looking at our own actions, we deeply felt that the crux of the problem was the lack of guidance from Mao Zedong Thought. In the past, we only saw the poor material conditions, and we carried the burden of "old disaster area, poor conditions, weak foundation, and poor commune members," and always felt that to turn over, we had to rely on state support, and relying on our own efforts could only be done slowly, regarding external causes as the decisive factor. We always tried to transform matter with matter, neglecting the subjective initiative of people and the revolutionary spirit of people. Poverty leads to change; we must work and make revolution. Poverty can stimulate revolutionary spirit and can be transformed into infinite material force. However, we did not give prominence to politics, and we did not persist in arming the people with Mao Zedong Thought, educating the people, and using "poverty" as a driving force to promote production.

    Last year, we earnestly studied Chairman Mao's works, and the mental outlook of cadres and the masses has undergone great changes. This is particularly evident in winter production centered on water conservancy.

    Six communes in our county are south of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, and tens of thousands of mu of farmland along the Sheyang River are flooded every year during the rainy season. Originally, we could completely rely on our own efforts to repair the dikes to prevent disasters, but because the leadership only saw the poor material conditions and the difficulty in repairing the dikes, they did not believe in the power of the masses, did not believe in the subjective initiative of people, and looked upward, waiting for support. In this way, we made plans every year, asked for grain and money every year, year after year, but we never got it done. Last year, we organized the vast number of cadres and the masses to repeatedly study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and learn from the spirit of Dazhai, which achieved great results. The masses said: As long as we listen to Chairman Mao's words, the face of production can be greatly changed. The ancient Foolish Old Man could move mountains, and we can build dikes. Once we say we will do it, we will do it, without asking the state for a penny, a load of grass, or a catty of grain. In less than two months, we excavated 1.2 million cubic meters of earth and built a 150-li long dike. Other medium-sized backbone projects were also largely completed with our own hands in a very short time. These were impossible in the past.

    With revolutionary spirit, we can use the state's support where it is most needed, give it greater effect, and achieve faster results. Our county once dug a Yuefan River, organizing tens of thousands of full-time laborers, all of whom were paid by the state. We worked for more than half a year, spending money, but the project was not done well. What is the reason for this? It is because we did not give prominence to politics and develop the spirit of self-reliance, but relied solely on state support. We always thought that if we didn't do it well this year, we would have next year. As a result, the money was spent, the labor was used, but the river was silted up. In the winter of 1965, we excavated a Huangxiang River, and the situation was very different. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the vast number of cadres and the masses cherished the state's small investment very much. Twenty-five thousand laborers completed the task of 50 *hua li* long and 2.6 million cubic meters of earth in fifty days. More importantly, this river was dug in sandy soil. In the past, the masses always thought that rivers could not be dug well in sandy soil. The rivers that were dug would be dug in the first year, silted up in the second year, and leveled in the third year. But this time, the river slopes, green banks, and embankments were all covered with black soil, and an oily mud river was dug out of the sandy soil. Several thousand mu of land along the river have also been improved. Digging the same river, the same people digging the river, why did it cost more money, take longer, have lower efficiency, and have poorer quality in the past, while now it costs less money, takes less time, has faster efficiency, and has higher standards? The main reason is that the mental outlook of the people has changed. The masses all said: "In the past, we relied on the state for everything, which confused our minds and made our hands and feet lazy. Now we think of farming for the revolution, so we have a revolutionary spirit, and we can do things quickly and well."

    Over the past year, we have deeply realized that: from matter to matter, matter is finite; from spirit to matter, matter is infinite. As long as we regularly arm cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, spirit can be transformed into a tremendous material force, which can transform the world and change poverty into wealth.

### 革命精神能转化为巨大物质力量

    革命精神能转化为巨大物质力量
    从物质到物质，物质是有限的；从精神到物质，物质是无穷的。用毛泽东思想武装干部和群众，革命思想、革命精神就能转化为巨大的物质力量
    人的因素第一。人，只要有了革命精神，就能改天换地，就能创造社会物质财富。这点我们过去虽有认识，但是体会不深，在实际工作中没有很好运用。去年我们重新学习了毛主席关于发挥人的主观能动性、精神变物质等论述，指导工作实际，收到很好的效果。
    滨海县的农业生产一直是低而不稳。全县每人平均近二亩耕地，而粮食不能自给，年年要国家大量供应；全县有很多荒地和宜长柴草、树木的土地，而烧草不能自给，每年要国家供应煤炭；全县的自然资源非常丰富，发展多种经营有广阔的门路，而生产、生活资金不能解决。这种现状为什么迟迟改变不了呢？
    我们带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席著作。主席教导我们：“事物发展的根本原因，不是在事物的外部而是在事物的内部，在于事物内部的矛盾性”。毛主席还说：“……必须承认精神的东西的反作用，社会意识对于社会存在的反作用。”听听毛主席这些教导，看看自己的行动，深深感到问题的症结，就是缺少毛泽东思想作指导。过去，只看到物质条件差，背上了“老灾区、条件差，底子薄、社员穷”的包袱，总觉得要翻身得靠国家支持，靠自己翻身只能慢慢来，把外因看成是决定作用。总是试图以物质来变物质，忽视了人的主观能动作用和人的革命精神。穷则思变，要干，要革命。穷可以激励革命精神，可以转化为无穷的物质力量。但是，我们没有突出政治，没有坚持用毛泽东思想武装人民，教育人民，把“穷”作为动力去推动生产。
    去年，我们认真学习毛主席著作，干部群众的精神面貌起了很大变化。这一点，在以水利为中心的冬季生产中看得特别明显。
    我县在苏北灌溉总渠以南有六个公社，沿射阳河一线有几万亩农田，一遇雨季，河水倒灌，年年受害。本来，完全可以自力更生修好圩堤，防止灾害，但是由于领导上只看到物质差，修圩堤有困难，就是不相信群众的力量，不相信人的主观能动作用，两眼向上，坐等支持。就这样年年搞规划，年年要粮要钱，年复一年，始终搞不起来。去年，组织广大干部群众反复学习《愚公移山》，学习大寨精神，收效很大。群众说：只要听毛主席的话，生产面貌就能大改变。古代愚公能移山，我们就能筑圩堤。说干就干，不要国家一分钱、一担草、一斤粮，不到两个月，就挖了一百二十万方土，筑起一百五十里的长堤。其他一些中型骨干工程，也是在很短的时间内，用自己的双手大部分完成了。这些，在过去是办不到的。
    有了革命精神，就能将国家的支援用在刀口上，发挥更大的作用，收到更快的效果。我县曾挖过一条越翻河，组织了上万常备民工，一切由国家包下来，搞了大半年，钱花了，但工程没搞好。这是什么原因？就是因为没有突出政治，发扬自力更生精神，单靠国家支持的结果。总认为今年弄不好有明年，结果呢，钱用了，工花了，河却淤了。一九六五年冬，我们开挖了一条黄响河，情景就大不相同。广大干部群众在毛泽东思想的指引下，十分珍视国家少量投资，二万五千民工，五十天就完成了五十华里长、二百六十万方土的任务。更突出的是，这条河是在沙土地上挖的，过去群众老认为沙土地挖不好河，挖的河，是头年挖，二年淤，三年平。但是这次挖的河，河坡、青坎、堆身全部铺上了黑土，沙土地上挖出了油泥河。沿河还改良了几千亩土地。挖同样一条河，同样的人在挖河，为什么过去用钱多，时间长，工效低，质量差，而现在却是花钱少，时间短，工效快，高标准呢？主要是人的精神面貌变了。群众都说：“过去我们一切靠国家，把头脑弄糊了，手脚也懒了，现在我们想到种田为革命，就有一股革命精神，就能把事情办得又快、又好。”
    一年来我们深切体会到：从物质到物质，物质是有限的；从精神到物质，物质是无穷的。只要经常用毛泽东思想去武装干部和群众，精神就能转化为巨大的物质力量，就能改天换地，就能变穷为富。
