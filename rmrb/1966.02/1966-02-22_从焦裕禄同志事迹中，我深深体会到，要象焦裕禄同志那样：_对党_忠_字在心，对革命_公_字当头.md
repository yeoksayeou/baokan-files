    From Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, I deeply realized that we must be like Comrade Jiao Yulu:
　　"Loyalty" to the Party in our hearts, "Public" interest first for the revolution
    After studying the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong and an outstanding representative of county Party secretaries, I was deeply moved.
    In the winter of 1962, when Lankao County suffered the most severe damage from waterlogging, sandstorms, and saline-alkali soil, Comrade Jiao Yulu was sent there. What a difficult task was placed before him! However, he saw a bright future in the difficulties and uttered the heroic words, "Revolutionaries must show heroism in the face of difficulties." He had the practical spirit of inspecting wind gaps and exploring quicksand while ill, of "personally weighing how much the 'three scourges' of Lankao really weighed," and he also had the determination to change the face of Lankao, "not resting in peace until the goal is achieved." In short, Comrade Jiao Yulu acknowledged, understood, and overcame the serious difficulties. This was the result of his conscientiously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. He used his own practical actions to set a shining example for us of how to correctly deal with difficulties.
    Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, I am far behind! Recalling when I encountered difficulties, I only talked about them, but I didn't personally weigh how much the difficulties really weighed like Comrade Jiao Yulu did, didn't deeply understand the demands of the masses, and lacked an understanding of the great socialist enthusiasm hidden within the masses. As for how to find ways to overcome difficulties and establish the ambition to overcome them, I did even less.
    From Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, I deeply realized that in carrying out the revolution, we will encounter difficulties at any time. The question is what attitude to take towards them. If, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, we are guided by revolutionary thought, acknowledge them, understand them, and overcome them, we will certainly be able to quickly transform difficulties into smoothness; if we are frightened by difficulties, it is impossible to take a further step on the revolutionary road. No matter what difficulties we encounter, the leaders' thinking must not lag behind!
    Learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu is not enough to just talk about it. The conditions in Yushu are no worse than those in Lankao. The grass is tall and there is plenty of water, which is very beneficial for developing animal husbandry. The problem lies in whether the leading members of our county Party committee have the same drive as Comrade Jiao Yulu: "Loyalty" to the Party in our hearts, "Public" interest first for the revolution, and "Sincerity" in their hearts for the people. The human factor is first, ideological work is first, and overcoming "selfishness" and breaking through "difficulties" is invincible. I am determined to take Jiao Yulu as a mirror, examine my thoughts and actions, constantly transform myself, and strive to fully utilize Yushu's favorable conditions and build a new socialist pastoral area!

    从焦裕禄同志事迹中，我深深体会到，要象焦裕禄同志那样：
　　对党“忠”字在心，对革命“公”字当头
    学习了毛泽东同志的好学生、县委书记的出色代表焦裕禄同志的事迹后，我受到了深深的感动。
    在兰考县遭受内涝、风沙、盐碱三害最严重的一九六二年冬天，焦裕禄同志被派到了那里，摆在他面前的任务是多么困难啊！但是，他从困难中看到了光明的前景，说出了“革命者要在困难面前逞英雄”的壮语。他有带病查风口、探流沙、“亲自掂一掂兰考的‘三害’究竟有多大份量”的实干精神，又有改变兰考面貌“不达目的，死不瞑目”的决心。总之，焦裕禄同志对严重困难是承认它、摸清它、战胜它。这是他认真活学活用毛主席著作的结果。他用自己的实际行动，为我们树立了一个如何正确对待困难的光辉榜样。
    和焦裕禄同志比较，我相差了十万八千里！回想我在遇到困难时，只是口里叫困难，却没有象焦裕禄同志那样，对困难究竟有多大份量亲自去掂一掂，对群众的要求去深入了解，对群众中蕴藏的极大的社会主义积极性缺乏认识。至于如何想办法克服困难，树雄心战胜困难，做得更不够了。
    从焦裕禄同志的事迹中，我深深体会到：干革命，任何时候都会遇到困难，问题是用什么态度对待它。如果象焦裕禄同志那样，以革命的思想为指导，承认它，认识它，战胜它，就一定可以很快变困难为顺利；如果被困难吓倒，就不可能在革命的道路上前进一步。无论遇到了什么困难，领导的思想千万不能落后啊！
    学习焦裕禄同志，停留在口头上是不行的。我们玉树的条件不比兰考差，草高水多，对发展畜牧业很有利。问题就在于我们县委领导成员有没有焦裕禄同志那股劲头：对党“忠”字在心，对革命“公”字当头，对人民“诚”字在怀。人的因素第一，思想工作第一，去“私”破“难”，无往不胜。我决心以焦裕禄为镜子，照思想，查行动，不断改造自己，为使玉树的有利条件充分发挥作用，建设社会主义新牧区而努力奋斗！
