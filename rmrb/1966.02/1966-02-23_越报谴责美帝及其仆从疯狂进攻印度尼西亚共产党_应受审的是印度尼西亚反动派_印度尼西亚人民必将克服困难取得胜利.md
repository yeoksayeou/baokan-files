　　Vietnamese Newspaper Condemns US Imperialism and its Puppets for Frantically Attacking the Indonesian Communist Party
　　The Indonesian Reactionaries Should Be Tried
　　The Indonesian People Will Surely Overcome Difficulties and Achieve Victory
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th. The Vietnamese newspaper *People's Army Daily* published an article on the 20th, strongly condemning the persecution of Indonesian communists and other patriotic and progressive forces by Indonesian reactionaries, condemning the "trials" held by Indonesian right-wing forces in Jakarta, and pointing out that the Indonesian people will ultimately be victorious. The article stated that in these days, the revolutionary people of the world cannot help but feel anger at the white terror engulfing Indonesia. For more than four months, the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia, under the manipulation and encouragement of US imperialism, have been frantically persecuting Indonesian communists and other Indonesian patriotic and progressive forces, with large numbers of people being killed, thrown into prison, and subjected to tortures more cruel than those used in the Middle Ages.
    The article pointed out that the current situation in Indonesia is caused by the close collusion between the Indonesian reactionaries and US imperialism. The article stated that US imperialism has been constantly provoking Indonesia for more than a decade, instigating a series of coups in an attempt to force it to deviate from its path of actively struggling against imperialism. However, all these conspiracies have been thwarted by the strength of the various revolutionary organizations, headed by the Indonesian Communist Party. Therefore, the US ruling clique regards the Indonesian Communist Party and patriotic revolutionary forces as a thorn in their side, and they are trying to use their puppets to launch a frenzied attack on the Indonesian Communist Party and other patriotic revolutionary organizations.
    The article pointed out that the frantic attack on the Indonesian revolution by the reactionaries fostered by the United States has not only brought unparalleled suffering to the Indonesian people, but also seriously threatens the situation in neighboring countries. Therefore, the revolutionary people of the world should adopt a firm attitude and strongly condemn this criminal act by US imperialism and its Indonesian lackeys. The article concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people, together with the people of all countries, express strong anger at the terror campaign carried out by the Indonesian reactionaries—the running dogs of the United States. The Vietnamese people strongly condemn the "trials" currently being held in Jakarta. It is the Indonesian reactionaries—the servants of the United States—who should be tried and punished, because they have murdered the people. The Vietnamese people firmly believe that the Indonesian people, with their tradition of dauntless struggle, will surely overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory.

　　越报谴责美帝及其仆从疯狂进攻印度尼西亚共产党
　　应受审的是印度尼西亚反动派
　　印度尼西亚人民必将克服困难取得胜利
    新华社河内二十日电　越南《人民军队报》二十日发表文章，强烈谴责印度尼西亚反动派对印度尼西亚共产党人和其他爱国进步力量进行的迫害，谴责印度尼西亚右派势力在雅加达举行的“审讯”，并且指出印度尼西亚人民定将最后胜利。文章说，这些日子中，全世界革命人民不能不对笼罩印度尼西亚全国的白色恐怖感到愤怒。四个多月来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力，在美帝国主义的操纵和鼓励下，一直在疯狂地迫害印度尼西亚共产党人和印度尼西亚其他爱国进步力量，大批人被杀害、被投入监狱和受到比中世纪使用的更加残酷的酷刑。
    文章指出，印度尼西亚目前的局势，是印度尼西亚反动派和美帝国主义紧密勾结所造成的。文章说，美帝国主义十多年来不断向印度尼西亚挑衅，策动了一系列的政变，以图迫使它脱离它的同帝国主义积极斗争的路线，但是，所有这些阴谋，都被以印度尼西亚共产党为首的各革命组织的力量所挫败了。因此美国统治集团将印度尼西亚共产党和爱国革命力量视作眼中钉，他们力图利用他们的仆从对印度尼西亚共产党和其他爱国革命组织发动疯狂进攻。
    文章指出，受美国豢养的反动派对印度尼西亚革命的疯狂进攻，不仅给印度尼西亚人民带来了无比的苦难，而且还非常严重地威胁着邻国的局势。因此，全世界革命人民应当采取坚决态度，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其印度尼西亚走狗的这种罪恶行动。文章最后说，越南人民同各国人民一起，对印度尼西亚反动派——美国的走狗——进行的恐怖运动表示强烈愤怒，越南人民强烈谴责正在雅加达举行的“审讯”。应当受审受罚的是印度尼西亚反动派——美国的仆从——因为他们杀害了人民。越南人民深信，印度尼西亚人民以其大无畏斗争的传统，定将克服一切困难，取得最后的胜利。
