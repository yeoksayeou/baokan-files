    Learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu
    Dong Biwu
    In Lankao, three scourges persisted, problems unresolved for years.
    Outstanding Jiao Yulu, accepted the mission, difficulties to remove.
    First grasped the leading group, thoughts aligned and agreed;
    Revolutionizing thinking, eliminates all obstacles, leaving none behind.
    To understand the situation, the county committee went to each district;
    Visiting the poor, asking about their hardships, eating and living together with them.
    Personally traversed the county's four borders, the situation known like the back of his hand.
    Severe disasters can be stopped, the leadership's determination is required.
    The masses are actively driven, mobilization, willing to devote themselves.
    The rural potential is great, long neglected in the past.
    Now you advocate this, the path ahead is smooth.
    Knowing the traces of water's comings and goings, dredge and manage the rivers and canals;
    Where are the wind gaps? Plaster the shifting sands with "ointment";
    Terraced fields and ditches, the alkaline soil washed, it becomes fertile.
    Combining the strength of cadres and the masses, building and drawing a blueprint;
    The blueprint is not made up, implementing it, its benefits are initially seen.
    Self-reliance to regenerate, grain supply becomes basically sufficient,
    It is a pity you contracted a chronic illness, your accomplishments not fully seen.
    Long suffering from liver cancer pain, overwork damaged your body,
    Not avoiding severe wind and rain, not uttering hunger or cold cries,
    Concerned with the people's affairs, selfless, as if not existing.
    Strong class viewpoint, struggles not allowed to be smeared?
    Even in death, thinking of the sand dunes, wanting to be buried with them.
    Learning from Mao has a unique perspective, different from ordinary sentiment.
    Our Party mourns Comrade Jiao, whose model can surpass?

    学焦裕禄同志
    董必武兰考存三害，多年患未除。佼佼焦裕禄，受命困难摅。首抓领导班，思想同一趋；思想革命化，万难排无余。为了摸情况，县委走各区；访贫兼问苦，同食亦同居。亲历县四境，形势指掌如。灾重可救止，领导决心须。群众性积极，发动愿驰驱。农村潜力大，过去久忽诸。君今一提倡，前进是坦途。水知来去迹，疏浚理河渠；风口在何处？膏药贴沙墟；台田暨沟洫，碱洗即成腴。结合干群力，建设绘蓝图；蓝图非臆造，施行利见初，自力以更生，粮食云足粗，惜君撄痼疾，功未覩全敷。长抱肝癌痛，劳累损其躯，不避风雨恶，不作饥寒呼，关注人民事，忘身直若无。阶级观点强，斗争岂容诬？死犹念沙丘，埋尸欲与俱。学毛有独到，自与常情殊。吾党悼焦君，模范孰能逾。一九六六年二月九日
