    Shed Private and Selfish Thoughts
    Secretary of the Communist Party Branch of Beijing Fengtai Department Store, Han Likun
    I must learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's thorough revolutionary spirit and do my job well.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's working environment and conditions were extremely difficult, but he had the confidence and determination to lead the people of Lankao County to overcome the "three harms" and build a new Lankao. Compared to myself, the gap is huge. For example, the leadership has repeatedly called on us to learn from "Tianqiao," catch up with "Tianqiao," and surpass "Tianqiao," but I myself only mention "learn" and "catch up," and don't even have the courage to mention "surpass." Why is this? The reason is that I have three fears in my mind: first, I fear that others will say we are arrogant, complacent, and boasting; second, I fear that we will not be able to surpass "Tianqiao," and the employees will complain, and the customers will criticize; third, I fear that we will not be able to surpass "Tianqiao," and the leadership will criticize us. If we only mention "learn" and "catch up," and don't mention "surpass," even if we don't surpass it, there is a way out, and we won't be blamed. These three fears show that I am not yet a completely and thoroughly dedicated Communist Party member serving the people. Because the leadership calls on us to surpass "Tianqiao," it is actually asking us to serve the people better. Because my selfish and impure thoughts are acting up, and I dare not mention the word "surpass," how can serving the people be said to be "complete" and "thorough"? In the future, I must take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, be a cadre who is infinitely loyal to the revolution, and be a Communist Party member without selfish and impure thoughts.
    At the same time, I must also learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's down-to-earth work style that emphasizes investigation and research and pays attention to working methods. If we want to surpass "Tianqiao" and serve the people better, it cannot be just empty talk. We should personally visit the residents and listen to the opinions of consumers, and work with the employees to study the specific measures to surpass "Tianqiao" so that our store can better serve the people.

    甩掉私心杂念
    中共北京丰台百货商店支部书记　韩丽坤
    我一定要学习焦裕禄同志彻底的革命精神，做好自己的工作。
    焦裕禄同志的工作的环境和条件是十分困难的，但是，他却有信心、有决心领导兰考县人民战胜“三害”，进行建设新兰考的斗争。对比自己，差距很大。如领导上一再号召我们学“天桥”、赶“天桥”、超“天桥”，可是我自己却只提“学”和“赶”，连提个“超”字的勇气都没有。为什么会这样？原因是我思想上有三怕：一怕别人说我们骄傲自满、吹牛皮；二怕超不了“天桥”，职工埋怨，顾客批评；三怕超不了“天桥”，领导上批评。如果只提“学”、“赶”，不提“超”，就是超不过，也有一个退身路，不会落埋怨。这三怕思想，说明自己还不是一个完全、彻底为人民服务的共产党员。因为领导上号召我们超“天桥”，实际上就是要求我们更好地为人民服务。自己因私心杂念作怪而不敢提“超”字，为人民服务怎能说是“完全”和“彻底”呢？今后我一定要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，做一个对革命无限忠诚的干部，做一个没有私心杂念的共产党员。
    同时，我还要学习焦裕禄同志那种重视调查研究，讲究工作方法的扎扎实实的工作作风。我们要超“天桥”，要更好地为人民服务，也不能是一句空话，应该亲自去访问居民群众，听取消费者的意见，和职工们一道研究超“天桥”的具体措施，使我们商店能更好地为人民服务。
