    Never "Measure the Wrong Size"
    The handling of an incident where a customer's pants were burned provided us with a lesson in politics: Everything should first be measured with the yardstick of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Last year, we burned a customer's pants. The two different ways we handled this problem before and after reflect two different styles of business management. Through this incident, we further understood the necessity of highlighting politics in everything.
    A customer brought us a piece of beige gabardine fabric and asked us to make a pair of men's trousers. These pants were given to an apprentice to make. Woolen clothes need to be sewn and ironed at the same time. Who knew that she would carelessly scorch the cuff of the trouser leg. Some people worried that if the customer found out, the enterprise would have to pay dozens of yuan in compensation. Others thought of trying to remove the yellow stain. According to past experience, putting it in the sun might fade it, but it didn't work even after being exposed to the sun three times. With the agreed date fast approaching, what could be done? Finally, a solution was devised: take off the cuff and remake it. Fortunately, gabardine fabric doesn't have a clear front and back, so the yellow stain could be turned inside the trouser leg cuff without affecting the quality of the pants, and the customer wouldn't be able to see it. After it was done, everyone looked at it and said there were no flaws. In this way, the pants were sent to the sales department and quietly given to the customer.
    Afterwards, there was a lot of discussion in the workshop and sales department. Many comrades disagreed with this approach, saying that it was abandoning politics and putting business in command. Some people said: "This way of handling it is wrong, it's deceiving the customer. We are a socialist enterprise and should tell the customer the truth, admit our mistake, and compensate if we should." However, some people chimed in to "smooth things over": "We make a lot of clothes here, and it's inevitable that there will be minor problems. If we tell the truth, the customer will definitely jump up, isn't that just asking for trouble?"
    The store leaders discovered this situation and believed that it was a struggle between two management ideologies and two management styles, so they organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's writings and debated the issue of these pants. After studying and repeatedly discussing, everyone realized that this approach was not working thoroughly for the benefit of the people as Chairman Mao taught. This act of deception was the capitalist business ideology at work, and it was "measuring the wrong size" compared to the socialist business principle of seeking truth from facts. If an accident occurs in the work, it will certainly damage the reputation of socialist commerce, but hiding the accident and deceiving the customer is adding insult to injury!
    Chairman Mao said: "If we have shortcomings, we are not afraid to have them pointed out and criticized, but we must never deny them. On the contrary, we must be determined to correct them." The higher-level company and store leaders decided to send someone to the customer's home to apologize and compensate for the loss. The customer was a worker at the Velvet Factory. He hadn't even noticed this problem originally. After we told him about the situation, he not only didn't blame us and didn't want compensation, but instead said with emotion: "Only shops under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party would do this. Your honest attitude is much better than compensating with a few yuan!" The next day, the leading comrades of our store visited again. The customer only said that he hoped we would learn from the experience ideologically and serve the people better in the future. All of this deeply educated us. Some people said: How far this is from my original thoughts!
    This incident gave us a vivid political lesson. We in the clothing industry have two rulers, one bamboo ruler for measuring clothes, and the other ruler for measuring thoughts, which is Mao Zedong Thought. Everything should first be measured with the yardstick of Mao Zedong Thought. We also realized that accidentally burning the pants was originally not a big deal; but trying to deceive and muddle through it became a big problem of treating customers with bourgeois means. In the future, we must be extremely responsible to customers, and we must carefully check every procedure of measuring, cutting, sewing, and ironing to avoid accidents as much as possible. If we accidentally make clothes badly, we must dare to admit our mistakes to the customer. This can gain the customer's understanding and solve the problem reasonably.
    Some experienced masters also realized that as masters, it is not only important to impart excellent skills to apprentices, but more importantly, to spread socialist business ethics. Those muddled thoughts and wrong practices of some people must never be passed on to apprentices.

    千万不要“错了尺寸”
    烫坏顾客一条裤子这件事故的处理过程，使我们上了一堂政治课：凡事应当先用毛泽东思想这把尺子量一量。
    去年，我们烫坏顾客一条裤子。对这个问题，前后两次不同的处理，反映出两种不同的经营作风。通过这件事情，我们进一步懂得了处处突出政治的必要性。
    有位顾客拿来一段米色凡尔丁料子，要我们做一条男式长裤。这条裤子交给一个艺徒去做。毛料衣服是要一边缝，一边烫的。谁知她一不当心，烫黄了裤脚管的翻口。有人担心，如果顾客知道了，企业要赔几十元。也有人想设法把黄渍去掉。按照过去的经验，放在太阳底下可能晒得掉，但是一连晒了三次还是不起作用。眼看约期快到，怎么办呢？最后想出一个办法：拆掉翻口重做。好在凡尔丁料子看不出正面反面，把黄渍翻进裤脚的翻口里边，不会影响裤子质量，顾客也看不出来。做好以后，大家看了，都说没啥破绽。就这样，这条裤子送到门市部，不声不响地给顾客拿去了。
    事后，工场和门市部里都议论纷纷。许多同志不同意这种做法，说这是丢了政治，业务挂帅。有的人说：“这样处理不对头，是欺骗顾客。我们是社会主义企业，应该向顾客说老实话，承认错误，该赔就赔。”可是，也有人在旁边“打圆场”：“我们这里，衣服做得多，难免要出点小毛病。讲了老实话，顾客一定要跳起来，还不是自找麻烦？”
    商店领导发现这种情况，认为这是两种经营思想、两种经营作风的斗争，就组织大家学习毛主席著作，就这条裤子的问题进行辩论。经过学习和反复议论，大家认识到，这种作法是没有按照毛主席教导的那样，彻底地为人民的利益工作。这种欺骗行为，是资本主义经营思想在作怪，同社会主义商业的经营原则——实事求是，“错了尺寸”。工作中出了事故，固然会损害社会主义商业的信誉，隐瞒事故欺骗顾客，就错上加错！
    毛主席说：“如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。”上级公司和商店领导决定派人到顾客家里去道歉，赔偿损失。顾客是绒布厂的工人，他本来还没有发现这一问题，听我们说了这一情况以后，非但不责怪我们，也不要赔偿，反而感动地说：“只有毛主席、共产党领导下的商店，才会这样做。你们这种老老实实的态度，比赔几个钱不知要好多少倍！”第二天，我们商店的领导同志又上门去访问。顾客只是说希望我们从思想上吸取教训，今后更好地为人民服务。这一切，深深地教育了我们。有些人说：这与自己当初的想法距离多远啊！
    这件事情，给我们上了一堂生动的政治课。我们服装行业有两把尺子，一把竹尺，是量衣服的，另一把尺子是量思想的，这就是毛泽东思想。凡事应当先用毛泽东思想这把尺子来量一量。我们还体会到：不当心烫坏裤子，原来不是多了不起的大事；可是想欺骗瞒混过去，那就成了用资产阶级手段对待顾客的大问题。今后，对顾客要极端负责任，量、裁、缝、烫几道工序都要认真把关，尽量避免出事故。偶而做坏了衣服，则要敢于向顾客承认错误。这是可以得到顾客谅解，可以合理解决问题的。
    一些老师傅还体会到：作为师傅，不但要向徒弟传授过硬的技术，更重要的是传播社会主义的商业道德。象有些人那种糊涂思想和错误作法，是千万不能传给徒弟的。
