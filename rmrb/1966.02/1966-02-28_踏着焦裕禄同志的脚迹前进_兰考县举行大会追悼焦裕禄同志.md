　　Advancing in the Footsteps of Comrade Jiao Yulu
    Lankao County Holds Memorial Service for Comrade Jiao Yulu

    On the afternoon of February 26th, the Lankao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a memorial service in front of Comrade Jiao Yulu's tomb, mourning Comrade Jiao Yulu, Chairman Mao's good student.

    That day, five to six thousand people attended the memorial service.

    At the memorial service, Zhao Wenfu, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee Secretariat and Vice Governor, said that at present, the vast number of party members and cadres in the province are studying Chairman Mao's works extensively. Everyone should use Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror to examine their thoughts, review their work, identify shortcomings, and catch up. Under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, let us follow the path of striving for progress and self-reliance, muster our energy, accelerate basic agricultural construction, strengthen all aspects of our work, and strive to change the face of Henan. We will not stop until we achieve our goals.

    Representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants from the Zhao Duolou Brigade, who came to participate in the memorial service, brought their letter of determination to further change the production outlook. Representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants from the Qinzhai Brigade came to attend the memorial service only after every household in the village had completed writing their letters of determination. Five representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants from the Hancun Production Team each brought a shovel. Yang Qingshan, a representative of poor and lower-middle peasants from this production team, said: "Comrade Jiao Yulu gave us Chairman Mao's thought of self-reliance and also gave us a batch of shovels. We relied on Chairman Mao's thought and these shovels to deeply plow the land shovel by shovel, turning production around. In the future, we are determined to continue to follow the path of self-reliance and completely change the production outlook of our team." When representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants from the Shuangyangshu Brigade came to participate in the memorial service, the masses of this brigade were leveling the land and preparing to drill wells, so as to quickly build drought and flood-resistant, stable, and high-yield farmland.

    Not far from the cemetery is Xugongzhuang, a small village with only twenty-odd households, which Comrade Jiao Yulu personally armed with the spirit of self-reliance, turning them into a "hard-boned team." Sun Yutang, a poor peasant representative from Xugongzhuang, was transformed by Comrade Jiao Yulu from a disaster victim into a heroic man who stood tall. Sun Yutang said in front of the tomb: "Old Jiao, you don't need to worry about us anymore. The self-reliance you taught us has brought us self-sufficiency and more. You know, the total team output in 1963 was only 9,000 jin, but last year it reached more than 57,000 jin, and we sold more than 9,000 jin of surplus grain to the state alone."

    Comrade Jiao Yulu loved trees, especially paulownia trees. When he was dying, he was still thinking about the paulownia trees in Lao Hanling. Three young people from Lao Hanling participated in the memorial service. Three years ago, when Comrade Jiao Yulu adopted the suggestion of the old poor peasant Xiao Weifen in Lao Hanling and promoted the planting of paulownia trees everywhere, these three young people were only fifteen or sixteen years old. Comrade Jiao Yulu's promotion simply fascinated them. The three of them quietly built a thatched hut in the north field, lived there, and guarded the forest day and night.

    At that time, Comrade Jiao Yulu was staying in Lao Hanling and was very concerned about the activities of these three young forest rangers. One day, he came to see them. It was early spring, and Comrade Jiao Yulu asked them, "Are you cold?" They all said, "No, we're not cold." He also asked them, "Are there any difficulties?" They said, "No." Hearing these firm and resolute answers, Comrade Jiao Yulu was very satisfied and praised them as young forest ranger heroes. They remembered Comrade Jiao Yulu's words praising them as "little heroes" and said, "Heroes are not afraid of any difficulties." From the spring of 1963 to the autumn of last year, they lived in the small hut for more than two years and guarded the thousands of paulownia trees in a radius of three or four li until they grew up.

    Wu Xiuhua, a poor peasant woman from the Xin Hanling Brigade, stood in front of the tomb, unable to control her tears. In the spring of 1963, Comrade Jiao Yulu heard from someone that Wu Xiuhua's husband had died and that she had to raise six children by herself. One day, Comrade Jiao Yulu came to Wu Xiuhua's house in person. He first checked whether her rooms were leaking, then went to the kitchen to lift the pot lid to see what her family was eating, and learned about the situation of each child in detail. Before leaving, he said to Wu Xiuhua: "Raise your children well. If there are people, there is everything. Now we have the Party and the collective. No matter how big the difficulties are, they are not considered difficulties. Don't bow your head in the face of difficulties." Wu Xiuhua felt that she didn't need anything else at that time, what she needed was this sentence.

    Wu Xiuhua, who was in her forties, stood tall and straight and had always been one of the best laborers in the brigade. Later, she was named a county labor model and attended the county heroes' meeting.

    Wu Xiuhua stood in front of the tomb with tears streaming down her face. She said, "Old Jiao, my eldest son recently joined the Party, and my second son heard the news of your death and said to me with tears in his eyes: 'Mom, if I don't work hard, I'll be letting down the Party and letting down Old Jiao. Old Jiao cared so much about our family. I only have one idea now: how to produce more grain and how to quickly change the face of Lankao.'"

    Zhang Chuande, a poor peasant from Qian Yangzhuang, brought his three-year-old child Ji Jiao to the tomb.

    In the autumn of 1963, when Xiao Xuzhou was just over one year old, his original asthma recurred. The brigade health station and the commune health center sent people to treat him many times, but they could not cure him, and it became more and more serious. One day, Jiao Yulu came to Zhang Chuande's house and immediately asked Zhang Chuande to send the child to the county hospital. After the child was admitted to the hospital, after rescue treatment, he recovered in less than a month. The child's mother was very grateful and said to everyone she met: "If it weren't for the Communist Party, my Xuzhou would have died long ago."

    Comrade Jiao Yulu passed away. Zhang Chuande and his wife were very sad. In order to commemorate Comrade Jiao Yulu, they changed Xiao Xuzhou's name to "Ji Jiao." Now, the three-year-old Ji Jiao can answer familiar people with these words:

    "Ji Jiao, who cured your illness?"

    "Secretary Jiao."

    "What do you want to do when you grow up?"

    "Change the face of Lankao."

    In the child's two simple sentences, there is a deep class feeling of Zhang Chuande and his wife! It contains the determination of Zhang Chuande and his wife to transform the face of Lankao. Zhang Chuande brought his child from forty li away to attend the memorial service, so that the child could inherit Comrade Jiao Yulu's legacy like his name.

### 踏着焦裕禄同志的脚迹前进  兰考县举行大会追悼焦裕禄同志

　　踏着焦裕禄同志的脚迹前进
    兰考县举行大会追悼焦裕禄同志
    二月二十六日下午，中共兰考县委会在焦裕禄同志的墓前，举行追悼大会，悼念毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志。
    这天，参加追悼大会的有五六千人。
    追悼大会上，中共河南省委书记处书记、副省长赵文甫说，目前，全省广大党员、干部正在大学毛主席著作，大家要以焦裕禄同志为镜子，检查思想，检查工作，找出差距，迎头赶上。让我们在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，沿着奋发图强、自力更生的道路，鼓足干劲，加速农田基本建设，加强各方面的工作，为改变河南面貌而奋斗，不达目的，誓不罢休。
    来参加追悼大会的赵垛楼大队的贫农下中农代表，带来了他们进一步改变生产面貌的决心书。秦寨大队的贫农下中农代表看着全村家家户户写完了决心书，才来参加追悼会。韩村生产队五个贫农下中农代表一人带来了一把铁锨，这个生产队的贫农下中农代表杨青山说：“焦裕禄同志把毛主席自力更生的思想交给我们，又给了我们一批铁锨。我们就是靠毛主席的思想，靠这些铁锨，一锨锨地深翻土地，使生产翻了身。今后我们决心继续走自力更生的道路，彻底改变队里的生产面貌。”在双杨树大队的贫下中农代表来参加追悼会的时候，这个大队的群众正在平整土地和准备开钻打井，以便很快建成旱涝保收稳产高产农田。
    离墓地不远是许贡庄，这个只有二十几户人家的小村子，是焦裕禄同志亲手用自力更生的精神武装起来的“硬骨头队”。许贡庄的贫农代表孙玉堂，是焦裕禄同志让他从一个灾民，变成了一个顶天立地的英雄汉。孙玉堂在墓前说：“老焦，你不用再为俺操心了，你教给俺的自力更生换来了自给有余。你知道，一九六三年全队产量才九千斤，去年达到五万七千多斤，光卖给国家的余粮就有九千多斤。”
    焦裕禄同志爱树，特别爱泡桐树。他临终的时候，还惦念着老韩陵的泡桐树。老韩陵有三个青年参加了追悼会。三年以前，焦裕禄同志在老韩陵采纳了老贫农萧位芬的建议，到处宣传种泡桐树的时候，这三个小青年，才只有十五六岁。焦裕禄同志的宣传，简直使他们入了迷，他们三个人悄悄地在北地搭起一个草庵子，住在那里，日夜护林。
    那时，焦裕禄同志在老韩陵蹲点，很关心这三个小护林员的活动。有一天，他来看他们了。那时刚开春不久，焦裕禄同志问他们“冷不冷？”都说“不冷。”又问他们“有困难没有？”他们说：“没有。”听着这些斩钉截铁的回答，焦裕禄同志很满意，称赞他们是护林小英雄。他们记住焦裕禄同志称赞他们是“小英雄”的话，说：“英雄是不怕任何困难的。”从一九六三年春天，到去年秋后，他们在小庵子里住了两年多，把方圆三四里的几千棵泡桐树看管大了。
    来自新韩陵大队的贫农妇女吴秀花，站在墓前，无法控制自己的热泪。一九六三年春，焦裕禄同志不知听谁说吴秀花死了丈夫，自己要带六个孩子。有一天，焦裕禄同志亲自到吴秀花家里来了。他先检查她的几间房子漏不漏，又到厨房掀开锅盖看她家吃的什么，详细了解了每个孩子的情况，临走时，他对吴秀花说：“好好把孩子拉把大，有人，啥都有了。现在有党、有集体，再大的困难不算困难，你不要在困难面前低头。”吴秀花觉得她当时什么也不需要，需要的就是这句话。
    四十多岁的吴秀花，挺着腰杆，昂着头，一直是大队最棒的劳力之一。后来，她被评为县的劳动模范，出席了县群英会。
    吴秀花泪流满面地站在墓前，她说：“老焦，我的大儿子最近入党了，二儿子听说你死的消息，含着泪对我说：‘娘，我要不好好干，对不起党，对不起老焦。老焦对咱一家多关心，我现在只有一个想法：咋样多打粮，咋样赶快改变兰考的面貌。’”
    前杨庄的贫农张传德，扯着他三岁多的孩子继焦来到了墓前。
    一九六三年秋，当小徐州一岁多的时候，原来的气喘病又复发了，大队卫生所，公社卫生院多次派人治疗，都没有治好，而且越来越严重。一天，焦裕禄来到张传德的家里，立即叫张传德把孩子送到了县医院。孩子入院后，经过抢救治疗，不到一个月病就痊愈了。孩子的妈妈非常感激，一见人就说：“要不是共产党，俺徐州早死了。”
    焦裕禄同志逝世了，张传德夫妇十分悲痛，为了纪念焦裕禄同志，他们把小徐州的名字改为“继焦”。现在，三岁多的小继焦，就能对相熟的人答出这样的话：
    “继焦，你的病是谁治好的？”
    “是焦书记。”
    “你长大了干什么？”
    “改兰考面貌。”
    在孩子两句简单的话里，蕴藏着张传德夫妇深沉的阶级情意！包含着张传德夫妇改造兰考面貌的决心。张传德带着孩子从四十里外赶来参加追悼会，为的是要让孩子象他的名字一样继承焦裕禄同志的遗志。
