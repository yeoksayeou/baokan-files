    A Sign of the US Intensifying Aggression and Expanding Adventures in Asia, and a Result of the Disastrous Defeat of US Aggressive Policies in Asia.
    American Imperialism Is Shifting Its Global Strategic Focus from Europe to Asia
    American imperialism is gradually shifting the focus of its counter-revolutionary global strategy from Europe to Asia, directing its spearhead of aggression primarily at China, taking China as its main enemy.

    This major change in the U.S. strategic focus began to brew several years ago, and has gradually matured and become increasingly public in recent years. On October 21st of the year before last, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk declared after the successful explosion of China's first atomic bomb that "the main problem of U.S. foreign policy at present is how to deal with China... with the problem of having nuclear weapons." On January 4th of last year, U.S. President Johnson clamored in his "State of the Union Address" to Congress that "in Asia, the communist revolution is carrying a more aggressive face," while the United States and the Soviet Union can seek "peaceful understanding." On February 18th, U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara testified before the House Armed Services Committee, and, according to U.S. news agencies, he explicitly stated that "China is the main enemy of the United States today," and said that the United States "intends to unswervingly oppose Communist China." These remarks indicate that the U.S. ruling clique has made a decision to shift its strategic focus to Asia.

    After this, U.S. imperialism stepped up its activities in this regard. In mid-December of last year, McNamara, at the meeting of the Ministerial Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, while touting "détente" with the Soviet Union, talked extensively about China's "military potential," clamoring about China's "threat," and attempting to pull its Western European allies to oppose China together. The U.S. plotting joint anti-China efforts at the North Atlantic Group meeting was an unprecedented action. This shows how impatiently U.S. imperialism is implementing and deploying its new strategy with China as its main opponent.

      Reasons for the eastward shift of the global strategic focus:
    China becomes the main obstacle to the United States' pursuit of its aggressive policy
      The victory of the Vietnamese people disrupts the U.S. aggression deployment
        The Soviet revisionists' pursuit of a policy of surrender leaves the U.S. with no worries about its rear

    The eastward shift of the U.S. global strategy is an important sign of U.S. imperialism intensifying its policy of aggression and war in Asia, and it is also the result of the serious setbacks suffered by U.S. imperialism in its policy of aggression and war in Asia. Due to the rapid development of the anti-U.S. revolution in Asia, and due to China's resolute opposition to U.S. imperialism and its firm support for the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, Washington's original global strategy with Europe as its focus has been disrupted, and it has been forced to shift its focus to Asia.

    In recent years, the upsurge of the Asian people's revolutionary movement has made it difficult for U.S. imperialism to cope and has left it exhausted. In particular, the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in the war against U.S. aggression have exposed the true colors of U.S. imperialism as a paper tiger. The victory of the Vietnamese people has further disrupted the U.S. aggressive deployment based on its original global strategy, leaving the United States in a very passive and embarrassing situation where it is stretched thin and unable to cope. The U.S. ruling clique is also worried that the failure in the invasion of Vietnam will cause a "domino crisis" in the U.S. "enslaved Asian countries," with "a second and third South Vietnam appearing." Under these circumstances, U.S. imperialism is trying to concentrate its forces as much as possible, ferociously strengthening its aggressive deployment in Asia,妄想 to block the development of the Asian people's revolutionary struggle and save its failing situation.

    At the same time, the Khrushchev revisionists are stepping up their promotion of the line of "Soviet-U.S. cooperation to dominate the world," making concessions step by step on the German question and the West Berlin question. In the words of the Western press, the United States can "have no worries about its rear" and put its strength into Asia.

      A series of new deployments being taken:
        Strengthening overseas military forces with Asia as the focus
          Gathering the Soviet Union, Japan, and India to form an anti-China alliance
            Making every effort to win over Western European countries to join the anti-China front

    It is under these circumstances that China, which holds high the banner of revolution, has been regarded by U.S. imperialism as the main obstacle to its pursuit of its aggressive policy. U.S. bourgeois commentator Lippmann declared last January that "the center of world turmoil has shifted from the Iron Curtain in Western Europe to the area around Communist China"; the United States will make some "major choices." Another commentator, Reston, said even more bluntly that "for thirty years, the United States has been focusing on containing the Soviet Union, but in the next thirty years, the main force of the United States will be to contain China in Asia." U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara recently said that the United States believes that China is "the biggest problem for the free world."

    In order to achieve its goal of shifting its global strategy eastward, U.S. imperialism is taking a series of new deployments.

    Currently, the Johnson administration is redeploying U.S. overseas military forces with Asia as the focus and China as the target. In the past year, while constantly withdrawing troops to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, the United States has greatly intensified its military deployment in Asia and the Western Pacific to strengthen its military encirclement of China. The number of U.S. troops in this region has increased by nearly 200,000 compared to the past, with ground forces alone increasing from four divisions to eight divisions. The strength of U.S. troops in this region has exceeded the strength of troops stationed in Europe (five divisions and one brigade). Correspondingly, the U.S. military strategy is also shifting from being centered on the U.S.-Soviet confrontation to being centered on the U.S.-China confrontation. On the one hand, the United States has decided to greatly increase its conventional combat capabilities and focus on developing "certain conventional weapon systems that have not been given importance for thirty years." On the other hand, the United States is building what is said to be the largest naval and air force base in Asia at Cam Ranh Bay in South Vietnam, linking it with bases in northern Thailand and southern Laos to form a military base system aimed at China; the deployment of U.S. military bases in Japan has also shifted from the Hokkaido region near the Soviet Union to the Kyushu region aimed at China.

    In addition to adjusting its own forces to deal with China, U.S. imperialism is also racking its brains to gather a large anti-China alliance. According to the U.S. "Christian Science Monitor," this anti-China alliance has the Soviet Union, Japan, and India as its core.

    In order to further strengthen collusion with Soviet leaders, the United States, on the one hand, praises each other on major political issues such as the treaty on the prevention of nuclear proliferation, the World Disarmament Conference, and the UN standing forces, and engages in major political deals; on the other hand, under conditions that are conducive to the U.S. anti-China strategy, it vigorously encourages the Soviet Union to step up its activities in Asia. The U.S. "Business Week" wrote on November 6th of last year that one of the current U.S. policies toward Asia is to "decide not to oppose the Soviet Union's efforts to rebuild its influence in Asia"; "This policy is based on the recognition that the U.S. and the Soviet Union have a certain degree of common interest in opposing China."

    Japan has long been regarded by U.S. imperialism as the main base of aggression in the East, and its importance in the U.S. aggressive strategy is further enhanced. The formal signing of the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" under U.S. instigation shows that the United States allows Japan to extend its influence to South Korea, and through Japan, to organize the forces of South Korea and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan as the core of the Northeast Asian military alliance, serving as a tool for the U.S. anti-China efforts. Japanese militarism is accelerating its revival under the support of the United States and has formulated operational plans with Korea and China as its enemies.

    The United States also continues to control and woo India in order to consolidate this anti-China position on the subcontinent.

    In addition to this, the United States is also making every effort to try to win over Western European countries to participate in the anti-China front hosted by the United States. Britain, which is willing to follow the United States, is the main target of the United States. At present, the so-called "east of Suez" plan being discussed by the United States and Britain aims to jointly deal with China and the revolutionary forces of various Asian countries. As for other Western European countries, following McNamara's promotion of anti-China efforts at the North Atlantic Group meeting last December, Rusk and other U.S. dignitaries have repeatedly clamored, asking them to make "contributions" to support the U.S. "efforts" in Asia.

      Unable to save the failure of the aggressive policy:
          Will get deeper and deeper in Asia and become more embarrassed
              Its position in Europe will be further weakened
                Facing new difficulties and accelerating towards extinction

    U.S. imperialism is gradually shifting its aggressive global strategy from Europe to Asia in order to save the serious crisis of its world strategy. However, this action has brought it new contradictions and difficulties. The United States' shift of its strategic focus to Asia cannot but weaken its strength in Europe. This will be conducive to Western European countries strengthening their struggle against U.S. control and further weaken the U.S. position in Western Europe. Asia is now in a situation of rising revolutionary movements, and the United States is already deeply mired in Vietnam and cannot extricate itself. Putting more forces into Asia will only make it sink deeper and become more embarrassed. The United States attempts to gather an anti-China "holy alliance," but the Khrushchev revisionists have already been discredited and are trapped in internal and external difficulties; anti-U.S. storms in Japan are endless, and the broad masses of the people resolutely oppose the Sato government acting as a pawn for U.S. aggression; India is even more crisis-ridden and has a hard time making a living; as for Western European countries, most of them are lukewarm to following the United States in opposing China. Within the United States, the anti-war wave among the people is rising, and the ruling clique is also full of contradictions, arguing endlessly, and the Johnson administration's situation is becoming increasingly difficult.

    In short, U.S. imperialism has too much aggressive ambition and insufficient aggressive strength, fails everywhere, and is at the end of its rope. It still wants to struggle to the death,妄想to use the method of changing its strategic focus to carry out a counterattack, but this will not solve its difficulties or save its decline, but will only accelerate its process of extinction.

    是美国在亚洲加紧侵略扩大冒险的标志　也是美国侵略亚洲政策惨遭挫败的结果
    美帝国主义正把全球战略重点从欧洲移到亚洲
    美帝国主义正在把它的反革命全球战略的重点，逐步从欧洲转移到亚洲，把侵略矛头主要指向中国，以中国作为它的主要敌人。
    美国战略重点的这种重大改变，早在几年前就开始酝酿，而在近年来逐渐成熟，并日益公开化。前年十月二十一日，美国国务卿腊斯克在我国爆炸第一颗原子弹成功后宣称，“美国目前对外政策的主要问题是如何对付中国……手中有了核武器的问题”。去年一月四日，美国总统约翰逊在他向国会提出的“国情咨文”中叫嚷，“在亚洲，共产主义革命带着一种更富有侵略性的面貌”，而美国同苏联则可以谋求“和平谅解”。二月十八日美国国防部长麦克纳马拉向众议院军事委员会作证时，据美国通讯社透露，他明确提出“中国是今天美国的主要敌人”，并说美国“打算坚定不移地反对共产党中国”，这些言论表明，美国统治集团已经作出了战略重点移向亚洲的决定。
    在这以后，美帝国主义就加紧了在这方面的活动。去年十二月中旬，麦克纳马拉又在北大西洋公约集团的部长理事会会议上在鼓吹同苏联搞“和缓”的同时，大谈中国的“军事潜力”，叫嚷中国的“威胁”，企图拉它的西欧盟国同它一起来反对中国。美国在北大西洋集团会议上策划联合反华，这是前所未见的行动。这表明，美帝国主义是如何迫不及待地在执行并且部署它以中国为主要对手的新战略。
      全球战略重点东移的原因：
    中国成为美国推行侵略政策主要障碍
      越南人民的胜利打乱了美国侵略部署
        苏修执行投降政策使美国无后顾之忧
    美国全球战略东移，是美帝国主义在亚洲加紧推行侵略和战争政策的重要标志，同时也是美帝国主义在亚洲推行的侵略和战争政策遭到严重挫败的结果。由于亚洲反美革命的猛烈发展，由于中国坚决反对美帝国主义，坚决支持各国人民的革命斗争，华盛顿原来以欧洲为重点的全球战略被打乱了，被迫把重点移到亚洲。
    近年来，亚洲人民革命运动的高涨，使得美帝国主义难于招架、穷于应付。特别是越南人民在反对美国侵略的战争中所取得的巨大胜利，揭了美帝国主义的老底，暴露了美帝国主义纸老虎的原形。越南人民的胜利，进一步打乱了美国根据原来的全球战略进行的侵略部署，使美国陷于捉襟见肘、极端被动的狼狈处境中。美国统治集团还担心侵越失败会使美国的侵略地盘发生“多米诺危机”，在美国“奴役下的亚洲国家出现第二个、第三个南越”。在这种情况下，美帝国主义就力图尽可能集中力量，穷凶极恶地加强在亚洲的侵略部署，妄想阻遏亚洲人民革命斗争的发展，挽救自己的失败处境。
    与此同时，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者加紧推行“苏美合作主宰世界”的路线，在德国问题和西柏林问题上步步退让。用西方报刊的话来说，美国可以“无后顾之忧”，而把力量放到亚洲来。
      正在采取的一系列新部署：
        以亚洲为重点加强海外军事力量
          纠集苏联日本印度成立反华同盟
            竭力拉拢西欧国家参加反华阵线
    正是在这种情况下，高举革命旗帜的中国，便被美帝国主义看成为它推行侵略政策的主要障碍。美国资产阶级评论员李普曼在去年一月宣称，“世界动乱的中心已从西欧的铁幕移动到共产党中国的周围地区”；美国将作出一些“重大的抉择”。另一个评论员赖斯顿则更露骨地说，“三十年来，美国一直在集中力量遏制苏联，但是在今后三十年中，美国的主要力量是要在亚洲遏制中国。”美国国防部长麦克纳马拉最近说，美国认为，中国是“自由世界的最大问题”。
    美帝国主义为了实现其全球战略东移的目标，正在采取一系列新的部署。
    目前，约翰逊政府正在以亚洲为重点、以中国为目标，重新部署美国海外军事力量。在过去一年中，美国在不断抽调兵力扩大侵越战争的同时，大大加紧它在亚洲和西太平洋的军事部署，以加强对中国的军事包围。在这个地区的美军比过去已增加了近二十万人，仅地面部队就从四个师增加到八个师。这个地区的美军兵力已超过驻欧洲地区的兵力（五个师一个旅）。与此相适应，美国的军事战略也正以美苏对抗为中心转变为以美中对抗为中心。一方面，美国已经决定要大大增加常规作战能力，注重发展“三十年来所未重视的某些常规武器系统”。另一方面，美国正在南越的金兰湾兴建一个据说是亚洲最大的海空军基地，同泰国北部和老挝南部的基地联系起来，构成矛头针对中国的军事基地体系；美国在日本的军事基地的部署，也由靠近苏联的北海道地区移到指向中国的九州地区。
    美帝国主义除了调整自己的力量来对付中国以外，还正在煞费心机地纠集一个反华大同盟。据美国《基督教科学箴言报》透露，这个反华同盟以苏联、日本和印度为核心。
    为了进一步加强同苏联领导人的勾结，美国一方面在防止核扩散条约、世界裁军会议、联合国常设部队等重大政治问题上相互吹捧，大做政治交易；另一方面，在有利于美国反华战略的条件下，竭力鼓励苏联在亚洲加紧活动。美国《商业周刊》去年十一月六日就写道，目前美国对亚洲的方针之一就是“决定不反对苏联致力于重建它在亚洲的影响”；“这种政策是以承认美苏在反对中国方面有一定程度的共同利益为根据的”。
    日本长期来一直被美帝国主义视作在东方的主要侵略基地，目前在美国侵略战略中的重要性就进一步提高了。“日韩条约”在美国指使下正式签订，表明美国允许日本向南朝鲜伸张其势力，并且经过日本把南朝鲜和台湾蒋介石匪帮的力量组织起来，作为东北亚军事联盟的核心，充当美国的反华工具。日本军国主义在美国扶植下正在加速复活，并且制订了以朝鲜和中国为敌的作战计划。
    对于印度，美国也继续进行控制和拉拢，以巩固这个在次大陆的反华阵地。
    除此而外，美国还竭力企图争取西欧国家参加美国主持的反华阵线。甘心追随美国的英国，是美国的主要对象。目前，美英两国正在商谈的所谓“苏伊士以东”计划，目的就是要共同对付中国和亚洲各国革命力量。对于其它西欧国家，继麦克纳马拉去年十二月在北大西洋集团会议上鼓吹反华以后，腊斯克和其他美国要员又接连叫嚷，要它们为支持美国在亚洲的“努力”作出“贡献”。
      挽救不了侵略政策的失败：
          在亚洲将越陷越深更加狼狈
              在欧洲的地位将进一步削弱
                面临新的困难加速走向灭亡
    美帝国主义把它侵略性的全球战略从欧洲逐步转移到亚洲，是为了挽救它的世界战略的严重危机。但是，这种行动却使它面临了新的矛盾和困难。美国把战略重点转到亚洲，不能不削弱它在欧洲的力量。这将有利于西欧国家加强反对美国控制的斗争，进一步削弱美国在西欧的地位。亚洲今天正处在革命运动高涨的形势中，美国在越南已经深陷泥潭而不能自拔。它把更多的力量投入亚洲，只会使自己越陷越深，更加狼狈。美国企图纠集反华的“神圣同盟”，但是，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者已经声名狼藉，内外交困；日本国内反美风暴不绝，广大人民坚决反对佐藤政府充当美国侵略走卒；印度更是危机重重，日子难混；至于西欧国家，绝大部分都对于追随美国反华表示冷淡。在美国国内，人民反战浪潮日益高涨，统治集团内部也矛盾重重，争吵不休，约翰逊政府的处境越来越困难了。
    总之，美帝国主义侵略野心太大，侵略实力不足，到处失败，日暮途穷。它还要垂死挣扎，妄想用改变战略重点的办法来进行反扑，但这并不能解决它的困难，挽回它的没落，而只会加速它走向灭亡的进程。
