  Where are the Artistic Errors in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office?"
   Wu Yinxun

    Summary: The three "errors" in the creative thinking of the play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," as admitted by Comrade Wu Han, do not touch upon the essence of the problem.

    First, the problem is not in writing about the internal struggles of the feudal ruling class, but in Comrade Wu Han's erroneous view of the basic contradictions at the time, beautifying the feudal ruling class, and obliterating and harmonizing the contradictions between the peasants and the entire feudal ruling class.
    Second, the problem is not that Hai Rui was "overly emphasized," but that the class nature of Hai Rui was distorted.
    Third, Hai Rui's actions should not be beautified at all, and it is not a matter of showing individual work or highlighting individuals. The play highlights Hai Rui's spirit of independent work without fear of isolation in order to encourage right-leaning opportunists who are isolated.
    Comrade Wu Han's vague "admission of errors" is a smokescreen to cover up the real errors.

    In his "Self-Criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'," Comrade Wu Han quoted historical materials to refute Comrade Yao Wenyuan, and finally talked about the "errors" in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office":

    ——"From this, we can conclude that the theme of the play 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' should be the class struggle of the peasants against the landlord-bureaucrat group, not the internal struggle of the feudal ruling class."
    ——"From this, we can conclude that... he (Hai Rui) was overly emphasized, and his image was too lofty."
    ——"From this, we can conclude that... the play only writes about him working alone... promoting individual heroism."

    This is Comrade Wu Han's so-called "self-criticism" on creative thinking!

    Is "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" really wrong on these three issues? No! These three conclusions, seemingly self-critical, are actually evading substantive issues.

    First, can the internal struggle of the feudal ruling class be used as the theme of a historical drama? The answer is yes: although it is not the main subject matter for reflecting historical events and historical figures, we do not object to depicting it. If the internal struggle of the feudal ruling class is written from a Marxist standpoint, and history is correctly reflected through this depiction, what's wrong with that? From a Marxist standpoint, at least the following points should be clarified when looking at the internal struggles of the feudal ruling class in the late Ming Dynasty: First, both sides of the struggle are members of the exploiting class, and their contradictions and struggles do not harm the fundamental interests of the exploiting class. Second, this is a period of decline and decay of a feudal dynasty, and no matter what kind of nature the internal contradictions and struggles of the ruling class have and what different forms they take, they cannot save the inevitable demise of the feudal dynasty. Third, this struggle does not represent the basic contradictions of the society at that time, but it is closely related to the basic contradictions at that time, that is, the increasingly sharp contradiction between the peasants and the landlord class, which is on the eve of a major outbreak.

    How did Comrade Wu Han view and describe the basic contradictions at that time? He said: "The class contradiction in this area is the contradiction between the peasants and the rural officials, not the general contradiction between the peasants and the landlords; the class struggle in this area is the class struggle of the peasants against the rural officials." Therefore, he believes that if he writes about the "class struggle of the peasants against the landlord-bureaucrat group," it seems that it will be correct. Everyone knows that the basic contradiction of feudal society is the contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class. The struggle between peasants and rural officials is only a struggle with some landlords. This struggle is certainly very fierce, but in any case, the contradiction between peasants and rural officials cannot be recognized alone, and the fundamental contradiction between peasants and the feudal ruling class must not be concealed. If Comrade Wu Han does not have a correct understanding of the basic contradictions of feudal society, even if he writes about the "class struggle of the peasants against the landlord-bureaucrat group," it is still impossible to reflect the truth of history, and he will still make this or that kind of mistake.

    What's more, the peasants mentioned by Comrade Wu Han are not real peasants. Comrade Wu Han's judgment on the main contradictions in the Suzhou-Songjiang area is inferred from the severe land annexation there. As some comrades pointed out, the targets of land annexation are mainly small and medium-sized landlords and rich peasants, and those who go to Hai Rui to file lawsuits are also mainly these people. The "people" Hai Rui refers to mainly refers to these people. His "love for the people as children" and "speaking for the people" actually means representing these people to ask the big landlords to make some concessions to ease the contradictions between them, with the aim of consolidating the rule of the feudal dynasty.

    Comrade Wu Han does not analyze the contradictions at that time from a Marxist standpoint, but instead obliterates the basic contradiction between the peasants and the entire landlord class, and regards small and medium-sized landlords and rich peasants as peasants. In this way, in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," he absurdly wrote Hai Rui, a bureaucrat of the feudal ruling class, as a representative of the peasants, and defended the interests of the peasants by relying on the imperial seal issued by the emperor and the "three-foot royal law." Comrade Wu Han has drawn a wonderful picture: one side of the contradiction is the rural official Xu Jie; the other side is the upright official Hai Rui, behind whom stands a large group of peasants in rags, and an emperor wearing a dragon robe, and these three are so harmonious, it seems that as long as the law is upheld and Hai Rui wins, the peasants will be happy. Here, the contradiction between Hai Rui and Xu Jie is highlighted, while the contradiction between the peasants and Hai Rui, the peasants and the emperor, and the entire feudal dynasty and feudal system are all wiped out by the play without a trace. Many comrades' articles pointed out that the play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" beautifies and praises the feudal ruling class, and harmonizes the contradictions between the feudal ruling class and the peasant class. These are the essence of the problem. But Comrade Wu Han avoided these, and did not talk about the fundamental errors of his views and standpoint, but said that his "error" was only that he should not have written about the internal struggles of the feudal ruling class. Isn't this avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial?

    Let's look at the second point. Comrade Wu Han believes that the play is wrong in that Hai Rui was "overly emphasized, and his image was too lofty." According to this statement, Hai Rui himself was originally "lofty," but the play wrote it "too much," that is, exaggerated it too much, which caused the problem. Is that the case?

    If Hai Rui is really a lofty person, then what's wrong with exaggerating and highlighting him in the play? Artistic creation has always allowed exaggeration, and many excellent plays often exaggerate and highlight their heroic characters. However, exaggeration, as an artistic means, must obey the fundamental principle of shaping typical characters in typical environments. Exaggeration is to make the artistic image higher, more concentrated, more typical, more generalized, and more clearly and profoundly reveal the class essence of the characters and the class relations between the characters than the prototype in life, so as to better show the objective laws of life development. What does "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" exaggerate and highlight about Hai Rui? What problem does it want to explain by exaggerating and highlighting the image of Hai Rui? In the play, Comrade Wu Han portrays Hai Rui as a representative of the peasants, and prominently shows how Hai Rui works "for the people," in order to show that Hai Rui is the savior of the peasants. To say that a representative of the landlord class, an official of the ruling group, is the savior of the oppressed can only be said to be an extremely serious distortion, a nonsense without any class point of view. This is far from being a matter of artistic exaggeration and highlighting, but a matter of distorting the class essence of the characters, distorting the class relations between the characters, and advocating class reconciliation and reformism.

    Comrade Wu Han may refute that the play does not also "emphasize" Hai Rui's idea of maintaining the country's foundation and serving the emperor? In his "self-criticism," he excerpted many lyrics in this regard, which is clearly to refute those who criticize him. Unfortunately, these lyrics cannot help Comrade Wu Han. The play writes about Hai Rui's loyalty to the emperor, but it does not reveal that he is a tool for the feudal dynasty to oppress and exploit the people. On the contrary, the play tells people that serving the emperor and serving the peasants are consistent, and the more Hai Rui maintains the feudal law, the more the peasants will get real benefits. Here, what is beautified and praised is more than just Hai Rui alone? What is even more absurd is that the play not only writes a lot about how Hai Rui gave the peasants a "good life" of "no worries about food and clothing," but also finally fabricated an ending in which the evil tyrants were executed and he came off stage as a victorious hero. Comrade Wu Han fabricated these plots that did not exist in history and could never have existed to beautify some of Hai Rui's reform measures. Isn't this advocating reformism? Isn't this singing the opposite tune to the Marxist viewpoint of class struggle? Comrade Wu Han's saying that the problem is what "excessive prominence" and "excessive loftiness" is just a trick to cover up the wrong position!

    Let's look at the third point. Comrade Wu Han said that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is wrong in that "it only writes about him working alone... promoting individual heroism." Obviously, this is also specious. No one has asked Comrade Wu Han to endow the ancients with the spirit of collectivism and revolutionary heroism, and no one intends to deny the role of individuals in history. The problem is, what kind of individual? What kind of individual work?

    If they are outstanding national heroes, thinkers, artists, scientists, and politicians in history who have contributed to defending the motherland or promoting social productivity and the development of the motherland's culture, even though many of them came from the exploiting class, or even the rulers of the feudal dynasty, we do not object to making appropriate evaluations of their individual roles, affirming their contributions, and critically inheriting everything that is beneficial to the people.

    What kind of person is Hai Rui? He is just a feudal bureaucrat. What kind of individual work does he do? He is just maintaining the corrupt and declining feudal dynasty. He has made no contribution to the development of history. For people like Hai Rui, he should not be beautified at all, and it is not a matter of showing individual work or highlighting individuals. May I ask, if, as Comrade Wu Han said in his "self-criticism," we were to vigorously show Hai Rui's social foundation and describe his collective activities, wouldn't that be advocating class reconciliation and reformism? If Hai Rui is shown to be taking the mass line and the peasant masses also support him in maintaining the reform measures of the feudal dynasty, wouldn't this be a great slander against the peasant masses at that time?

    Of course, there is another reason why the play portrays Hai Rui as isolated. There is something hidden in it that is far more unsavory than individual heroism. The theme of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is "dismissal from office." In connection with the historical background in which it was written, it is precisely through Hai Rui's dismissal from office that it expresses sympathy for the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office at that time. Therefore, the more the play portrays Hai Rui as isolated, not tolerated by society, and finally forced to be dismissed from office alone, the more strongly it expresses sympathy for the dismissal of right-leaning opportunists; at the same time, the more it vigorously praises Hai Rui's spirit of independent work without fear of isolation, the more it cheers up the right-leaning opportunists who are isolated and encourages them to go their own way and work alone. Is this just "advocating individual heroism" and not a matter of political position? Comrade Wu Han said this only in an attempt to lightly turn a political problem into a small ideological problem.

    To sum up, the error of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a fundamental error of position, but Comrade Wu Han, through the above three conclusions, explains it as a problem of artistic expression and ideology. What is especially intolerable is that at the end of his "self-criticism," when answering "why he made such a serious mistake," Comrade Wu Han quoted a passage from Comrade Mao Zedong's evaluation of the May Fourth Movement to defend his mistake, saying that his mistake was that he "looked at historical problems formalistically" and "did not have a scientific method of analysis that divides one into two." Of course, Comrade Wu Han's methodology is formalistic, but the error of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is not a formalistic problem of "only talking about advantages and talking less or not talking about disadvantages." It is also necessary to see that although the May Fourth Movement had formalism, it showed a firm anti-feudal spirit and carried out an uncompromising struggle against the feudal system and feudal ethics; but Comrade Wu Han was beautifying the feudal system, praising Hai Rui, a loyal lackey of the feudal dynasty, acting as a defender for a small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist right-leaning opportunists, and shooting vicious arrows at the Party and socialism. Can this be covered up by a hat of formalism?

    In his "self-criticism," Comrade Wu Han had to say a few words such as "the position is wrong" and "it is an error of position," but he was always vague and hesitant about where the mistake was. Since Comrade Wu Han has talked about the issue of position, then he should at least answer: Why did you write this play? What kind of realistic political role do you want it to play? Who do you stand with? Who do you support? Who do you oppose? However, Comrade Wu Han is extremely secretive about these issues! The "issue of position" that he abstractly admits is specifically denied in a blink of an eye, and he tries his best to express that there is no problem with his position. After carefully analyzing Comrade Wu Han's three "errors" regarding "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," people can only draw the conclusion that the three "conclusions" he hurriedly "drew" are precisely the smokescreen to cover up the real errors. But the more he tries to express himself, the more people can't help but ask: If there is nothing unspeakable, why bother to clarify your mind so urgently? The "self-criticism" of ten thousand words is originally a book of denial that does not get to the point.

   《海瑞罢官》的艺术表现错在哪里？
    吴荫循
    提要　吴晗同志所承认的《海瑞罢官》创作思想方面的三点“错误”，都没有接触问题的实质。
    一，问题不在于写了封建统治阶级的内部斗争，而在于吴晗同志对当时的基本矛盾的看法是错误的，美化了封建统治阶级，抹煞和调和了农民和整个封建统治阶级之间的矛盾。
    二，问题不在于把海瑞“突出得过分”，而在于歪曲了海瑞的阶级本质。
    三，海瑞的所作所为根本不应美化，而不是什么表现单干、突出个人的问题。剧本突出海瑞的不怕孤立的单干精神，是为了鼓励陷于孤立的右倾机会主义分子。
    吴晗同志言不及义地“承认错误”，正是掩盖真正错误的烟幕。
    吴晗同志在《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》中引证史料，对姚文元同志反驳了一通之后，终于谈到了《海瑞罢官》的“错误”：
    ——“由此，可以得出结论，《海瑞罢官》这个剧本，主题应该是农民对大地主官僚集团的阶级斗争，而不是封建统治阶级的内部斗争。”
    ——“由此，可以得出结论，……把他（海瑞）突出得过分了，形象过于高大了”。
    ——“由此，可以得出结论，……剧本只写他一个人单干，……宣扬了个人英雄主义”。
    这就是吴晗同志关于创作思想的所谓“自我批评”！
    《海瑞罢官》真的就错在这三个问题上了吗？不对！这三点结论，貌似检讨，其实是在回避实质性的问题。
    先看第一点，封建统治阶级的内部斗争可不可以作为历史剧的主题呢？回答是肯定的：尽管它不是反映历史事件和历史人物的主要题材，但我们并不反对去描写它。如果以马克思主义的立场观点来写封建统治阶级的内部斗争，通过这种描写正确地反映历史，有什么不好呢？以马克思主义的立场观点来看明末时期封建统治阶级的内部斗争，至少应当明确以下几点：第一，斗争的双方都是剥削阶级的一员，他们的矛盾和斗争，都无损于剥削阶级的根本利益。第二，这是一个封建王朝没落腐朽的时期，无论统治阶级内部矛盾斗争具有何种性质和表现着不同的形式，都无力挽救封建王朝的必然灭亡。第三，这种斗争决不代表当时社会的基本矛盾，但它又同当时的基本矛盾，即日益尖锐、正处于大爆发前夜的农民和地主阶级的矛盾之间有着密不可分的联系。
    吴晗同志是怎样看待和描写当时的基本矛盾的呢？他说：“这个地区的阶级矛盾是农民对乡官的矛盾，不是一般的农民对地主的矛盾；这个地区的阶级斗争是农民对乡官的阶级斗争”。所以，他认为如果写了“农民对大地主官僚集团的阶级斗争”，好象就算正确了。谁都知道，封建社会的基本矛盾是农民阶级和地主阶级的矛盾。农民和乡官的斗争，只是同部分地主的斗争，这个斗争当然也是很激烈的，但是无论如何，不能只承认农民与乡官的矛盾，而掩盖农民与封建统治阶级的根本矛盾。如果吴晗同志对封建社会的基本矛盾没有正确的认识，他即使写的是“农民对大地主官僚集团的阶级斗争”，也仍然不可能反映历史的真实，仍然会犯这种或那种错误。
    何况吴晗同志所说的农民实际上并不是真正的农民。吴晗同志关于苏松地区主要矛盾的判断是从那里土地兼并严重这一情况推论出来的。正如有些同志指出的，土地兼并的对象主要是中小地主和富农，到海瑞那里去告状的也主要是这些人。海瑞所说的“民”主要也正是指这些人，他的“爱民如子”、“为民请命”实际上就是代表这些人要大地主作些让步，缓和他们之间的矛盾，目的是巩固封建王朝的统治。
    吴晗同志不以马克思主义的立场观点去分析当时的矛盾，反而抹煞农民和整个地主阶级这一基本矛盾，又把中小地主和富农当作农民，这样他就在《海瑞罢官》里，把封建统治阶级的官僚海瑞荒谬地写成了农民的代表，凭借皇帝颁发的大印、凭借“三尺皇家法”保卫了农民的利益。吴晗同志勾画出了一幅奇妙的图画：矛盾的一方是乡官徐阶；另一方是清官海瑞，海瑞的身后站着一大群鹑衣百结的农民，还有一个身穿龙袍的皇帝，而这三者又是如此和谐一致，似乎只要王法伸张，海瑞胜利，农民也就幸福了。在这里，突出了海瑞和徐阶之间的矛盾，而农民和海瑞的矛盾，农民和皇帝，和整个封建王朝、封建制度之间的矛盾，却被剧本一笔勾销，无影无踪了。许多同志的文章指出：《海瑞罢官》这出戏美化和歌颂了封建统治阶级，调和了封建统治阶级和农民阶级之间的矛盾，这些都是问题的实质。可是吴晗同志避开这些，不谈他的观点和立场的根本错误，而说什么他的“错误”只是不该写封建统治阶级的内部斗争，这难道不是避重就轻吗？
    再看第二点。吴晗同志认为剧本错在把海瑞“突出得过分了，形象过于高大了”。照这个说法，海瑞其人本来是“高大”的，只是剧本写得“过分”了一点，也就是夸张得过火了一点，才出了问题。事情是这样的吗？
    如果海瑞真是一个高大的人，那么，在剧本里夸张一点，突出一点，又有什么错呢？艺术创作从来是允许夸张的，很多优秀剧本对它的英雄人物也往往是夸张地、突出地加以歌颂的。但是，夸张作为一种艺术手段，必须服从塑造典型环境中的典型性格这一根本原则。夸张是为了使艺术形象比生活中的原型更高、更集中、更典型、更具有概括意义，更鲜明深刻地揭示人物的阶级本质和人物之间的阶级关系，更好地展示生活发展的客观规律。《海瑞罢官》夸张和突出海瑞的什么呢？它夸张地、突出地刻划海瑞这一形象是要说明什么问题呢？吴晗同志在剧本中把海瑞写成农民的代表，突出地表现海瑞如何“为人民”操劳，以此来说明海瑞是农民的救星。把一个地主阶级的代表，统治集团的官吏，说成是被压迫者的救星，这只能说是一种极其严重的歪曲，毫无阶级观点的胡诌。这已经远远不是什么艺术上夸张、突出的问题，而是歪曲人物的阶级本质，歪曲人物之间的阶级关系，宣扬阶级调和、改良主义的问题了。
    吴晗同志也许要反驳说，剧本不是也“强调了”海瑞维护国脉报圣上的思想吗？他在“自我批评”里摘录了许多这方面的唱词，分明就是反驳批评他的人。可惜的是这些唱词帮不了吴晗同志的忙。剧本写了海瑞的忠君思想，却并没有揭示出他是封建王朝压迫剥削人民的工具。恰恰相反，剧本告诉人们，为皇帝和为农民是一致的，海瑞越维护封建王法，农民就越得到真实利益。在这里，被美化和歌颂的岂止海瑞一人而已？更荒唐的是，剧本不但大写海瑞如何赐给农民“何愁衣饭”的“好光景”，而且最后还编造了一个处死恶霸，以胜利英雄姿态下场的结尾。吴晗同志杜撰这些历史上没有、也决不可能有的情节，来美化海瑞的一些改良措施，难道不是在宣扬改良主义吗？难道不是和马克思主义的阶级斗争观点唱反调吗？吴晗同志把问题说成什么“过分突出”、“过于高大”，只不过是掩盖立场错误的一种金蝉脱壳之计罢了！
    再看第三点。吴晗同志说《海瑞罢官》错在“只写他一个人单干，……宣扬了个人英雄主义”。显然，这也是似是而非的。谁也没有要求吴晗同志赋予古人集体主义精神和革命英雄主义精神，谁也不打算否认个人在历史上的作用，问题在于，是什么样的个人？单干些什么？
    如果是历史上杰出的民族英雄、思想家、艺术家、科学家、政治家，在保卫祖国方面或者在促进社会生产力和祖国文化发展方面有过贡献的人，尽管他们之中不少的人出身于剥削阶级，甚至是封建王朝的统治者，我们也不反对对他们的个人作用作出适当的评价，肯定他们的贡献，批判地继承一切有益于人民的东西。
    海瑞是个什么人呢？不过是一个封建官僚。他单干些什么呢？不过是维护腐朽没落的封建王朝。他对历史的发展没有任何贡献。对于海瑞这样的人，根本就不应该去美化他，而不是什么表现单干、突出个人的问题。试问，如果象吴晗同志在“自我批评”中说的那样，去大力表现海瑞的社会基础，描写他的集体活动，难道就不是宣扬阶级调和、改良主义吗？如果表现海瑞大走群众路线，而农民群众也支持他维护封建王朝的改良措施，这岂不是对当时的农民群众的极大污蔑吗？
    当然，剧本把海瑞写得孤立是另有原因的，这里头藏着比个人英雄主义远为见不得人的货色。《海瑞罢官》的主题是“罢官”，联系它写作的时代背景来看，它正是通过海瑞的被罢官寄同情于当时被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子。那么，剧本越是把海瑞写得孤立，不见容于社会，最后被迫孤零零地罢官而去，就越强烈地发泄了对于右倾机会主义分子被罢官的同情；同时，它越卖力歌颂海瑞不怕孤立的单干精神，也就越是给陷于孤立的右倾机会主义分子打气，鼓励他们一意孤行地单干下去。这难道只是什么“宣扬个人英雄主义”而不是政治立场的问题吗？吴晗同志这样说，只不过是企图把政治问题轻轻化作小小的思想问题罢了。
    总起来说，《海瑞罢官》的错误是根本性的立场错误，但是吴晗同志通过上面的三条结论，却把它解释成艺术表现上的和思想上的问题。尤其令人不能容忍的是，吴晗同志在“自我批评”的结尾，回答“为什么会犯这样严重性质的错误”时，引用了毛泽东同志评价五四运动的一段话，用来辩解自己的错误，说什么自己所以犯错误，是“形式主义地看历史问题”，“没有一分为二的科学分析方法”。当然，吴晗同志的方法论是形式主义的，但是，《海瑞罢官》的错误并不是什么“只讲优点，少讲或不讲缺点”的形式主义问题。还需要看到，五四运动虽有形式主义，但它表现了坚决的反封建精神，向封建制度、封建礼教进行了不妥协的斗争；而吴晗同志却在美化封建制度，歌颂海瑞这样一个封建王朝的忠实鹰犬，为一小撮反党反社会主义的右倾机会主义分子充当辩护士，向党、向社会主义射出了恶毒的暗箭。这岂是一顶形式主义的帽子所能掩盖得了的？
    在“自我批评”里，吴晗同志也不得不说几句“立场错了”、“是立场性质的错误”等，但错在哪里，始终含含糊糊，吞吞吐吐。吴晗同志既然谈到了立场问题，那么至少应该回答：为什么写这个剧本？要让它发挥什么样的现实政治作用？自己和谁站在一起？拥护谁？反对谁？然而，对这些问题，吴晗同志何其讳莫如深！他抽象承认的“立场问题”，转眼之间就又具体地否认掉了，反过来还极力表白他的立场没有问题。仔细分析了吴晗同志关于《海瑞罢官》的三点“错误”之后，人们只能作出这样的结论：他急忙“得出”的三条“结论”，正是掩盖真正错误的烟幕。但是他越卖力表白，人们就不禁越要发问：不是有什么不可告人的东西，何必那么着急地剖明心迹呢？洋洋万言的“自我批评”，原来是一篇言不及义的抵赖书。
