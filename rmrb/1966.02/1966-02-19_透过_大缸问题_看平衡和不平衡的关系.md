    Seeing the Relationship Between Balance and Imbalance Through the "Big Vat Problem"
    Electroplating Worker Zhang Yaoting
    I am a worker in the electroplating workshop, and there is a troubling matter in production, which is the preparation of electroplating solutions. The solution is made by mixing several chemical raw materials with water. In the past, we used wooden sticks to stir in a big vat, taking turns in groups of three. At most, we could produce one ton of material per shift, which was barely enough to supply production, and we were exhausted. Last month, the equipment in our workshop was adjusted, and the electroplating tanks were increased in number and size. Originally, five tons of material were enough at a time, but now thirteen tons are needed. What to do? On one side are advanced, large-capacity electroplating tanks, and on the other side is the backward big vat and manual stirring. This is like giving a "big bellied man" a small steamed bun to satisfy his hunger. This is of course a contradiction that needs to be resolved.
    Where to start to solve this? I thought about it again and again, and the problem lies with the big vat. If the big vat is not removed, then we need to add more vats and people, which is a way of accommodating backwardness and cannot solve the problem fundamentally. Another way is to simply remove the big vat and make a thorough reform, preparing a "canteen" for the "big bellied man." Comparing the two methods, it seems that the big vat must be removed. Once the method was decided, the determination was there. Comrade Wang Changlin, Comrade Cheng Chaoyou and I repeatedly researched and successfully innovated an electric mixer that can load one ton of material at a time and stir it evenly in thirty minutes. This not only improved the quality and saved labor, but also increased efficiency two-fold. In this way, a weak link in production was broken through.
    This matter made me think of a problem often encountered in production, which is how to understand and treat the phenomenon of imbalance in production development. Through the big vat problem, we can see the dialectical relationship between balance and imbalance in production development. What we workers do in production is to constantly break through weak links and solve the imbalance in production development, so that it can achieve a new balance on a new foundation.

    透过“大缸问题”看平衡和不平衡的关系
    电镀工　张耀庭
    我是电镀车间的工人，生产里有桩挠头的事，就是配制电镀溶液。溶液是由几种化学原料加上水搅拌的，过去我们是用木棍子在大缸里搅，三个人轮流着干，一班顶多能出一吨料，刚刚能供上生产，还累得满头大汗。上个月，我们车间的设备进行了调整，电镀槽子增多加大了，原来一次需要五吨料就够了，现在却需要十三吨，怎么办？一边是先进的大容量的电镀槽，一边是落后的大缸和手工搅拌，这很象是一个大肚子汉，要给他个小馒头垫饥，这当然是个矛盾，需要解决。
    从哪里着手解决，我想来想去，问题出在大缸上。如果大缸不搬走，就需要再增缸、添人，这是迁就落后的办法，不能从根上解决问题。另一个办法，就是干脆把大缸搬走，来个彻底改革，给“大肚子汉”准备个“食堂”。两个办法做了比较，看来不把大缸搬走是不行的。办法定了，决心就有了，我和王长林、程朝有同志反复研究，革新成功了一台电动搅拌器，用它一下子能装一吨料，三十分钟就能搅拌均匀，不仅提高了质量，节约了劳动力，还提高效率两倍。这样，生产上的一个薄弱环节就被突破了。
    这件事情使我联想到生产中常常碰到的一个问题，就是怎样认识和对待生产发展的不平衡现象。透过大缸问题，可以看到生产发展中平衡和不平衡的辩证关系。我们工人搞生产，就是要不断地突破薄弱环节，解决生产发展的不平衡现象，使它在新的基础上得到新的平衡。
