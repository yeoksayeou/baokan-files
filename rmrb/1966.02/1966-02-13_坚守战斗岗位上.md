    Sticking to the Battle Post
    Fan Zhixiu
    In mid-January this year, I returned to my hometown, Zhangjunmu Commune in Lan’kao County, to visit my family. Whether it was my family members, or the commune and brigade cadres, and the commune members, everyone would talk to me about Comrade Jiao Yulu’s exemplary deeds upon meeting me. Everyone praised him as a good head of household for our Lan’kao, and a good cadre of the Communist Party.
    Our team used to be a grain-deficient team. Thanks to Comrade Jiao Yulu leading everyone in hard work and practical efforts, it became a surplus grain team in 1965. Now, inspired by Comrade Jiao Yulu’s revolutionary spirit, everyone is full of confidence, fighting against nature and the land, to win a bumper harvest in agriculture this year. Old poor peasant Wang Qiju is over fifty years old and in poor health, but he is still working hard, saying that he wants to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu. The work point recorder, Han Jinming, is a middle school graduate and was not very dedicated to his work before. Comrade Jiao Yulu’s moving deeds of boundless loyalty to the revolution educated him and made him settle down. He expressed that he would take practical actions to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu’s noble qualities of loving Lan’kao and loving the people, and would never be indecisive about his work. Middle school graduate Wang Yongkuan repeatedly said to me when seeing me off to return to the army: "Comrade Jiao Yulu is a role model for me. I have made up my greatest determination to be red in the countryside and specialized in the countryside."
    At home, my grandfather, grandmother, father, and mother all said to me: "Zhixiu, Old Jiao worked hard for us poor and lower-middle peasants all his life, and we must learn from him. You should stay as long as the army needs you." I immediately expressed to my whole family: I must strive to study Chairman Mao’s writings well, learn Comrade Jiao Yulu’s revolutionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death, accelerate ideological revolutionization, diligently practice the skills to kill the enemy, always stick to the battle post, and be a lifelong proletarian conscript.

    坚守战斗岗位上
    范智修
    今年一月中旬，我回兰考县张君墓公社探家。无论是我家里的人，还是社队干部、社员群众，一见面都要给我谈焦裕禄同志的模范事迹。大家都称赞他是咱兰考的好当家人，是共产党的好干部。
    我们队原是个缺粮队。由于焦裕禄同志带领大家苦干实干，一九六五年已成了余粮队。现在，大家在焦裕禄同志的革命精神感召下，正满怀信心，斗天斗地，要夺取今年农业丰收。老贫农王起聚大伯五十多岁了，身体不大好，但还是一个劲地干，说要向焦裕禄同志学习。记工员韩金明，是个中学毕业生，以前不大安心工作。焦裕禄同志对革命无限忠诚的动人事迹教育了他，使他安下心来。他表示要以实际行动学习焦裕禄同志爱兰考、爱人民的高贵品质，决不三心二意地对待工作。中学毕业生王永宽在送我返回部队时，一再地说：“焦裕禄同志是我学习的榜样。我已下了最大的决心，红在农村，专在农村。”
    在家里，我爷爷、奶奶、父亲和母亲都对我说：“智修，老焦为咱贫下中农苦干一辈子，咱可要向他学习。部队需要你干到什么时候，你就干到什么时候。”我当即向全家表示：一定要努力学好毛主席著作，学习焦裕禄同志不怕苦不怕死的革命精神，加速思想革命化，苦练杀敌本领，永远坚守在战斗岗位上，当一辈子无产阶级义务兵。
