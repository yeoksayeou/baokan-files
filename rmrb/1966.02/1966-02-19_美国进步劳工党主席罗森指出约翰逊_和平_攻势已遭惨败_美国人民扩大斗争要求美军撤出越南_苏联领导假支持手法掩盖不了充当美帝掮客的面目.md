    Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from New York: Milton Rosen, Chairman of the Progressive Labor Party of the United States, published an article in the February 15th issue of the weekly "Challenge" pointing out that despite the role of Khrushchev revisionists as brokers, the "peace" offensive of American imperialism has suffered a shameful bankruptcy.
    The article wrote, "The deceitful 'peace offensive' has come to an end. The Johnson group's attempt to use blackmail to force the Vietnamese people to abandon their struggle for freedom has failed.
      "Johnson's pitiful attempt to show the world that the United States is 'sincerely working for peace' has no more chance of success than a lead balloon.
      "Johnson's conspiracy to deceive the American people has failed. Now, more people are joining the activities demanding that the United States get out of Vietnam immediately!" "The firmness, revolutionary courage, and unity shown by the Vietnamese people in the face of false 'peace propaganda' have set a good example for the world."
    The article continued, "During Johnson's trickery, the (American) newspapers were full of wishful thinking, believing that the Soviet Union would eventually lure the Vietnamese to negotiate with the Johnson group through this or that method. No matter how belligerent the Soviet Union's statements of 'support' for the Vietnamese position were, the American newspapers always understood the essence of these statements: (they were nothing more than) tricks to cover up the Soviet Union's basic role as a broker for American imperialism."
    The article pointed out that the resumption of the bombing of North Vietnam by the United States "only highlights the deception of the Johnson group. It once again shows that they are trying to stay in Vietnam at all costs. Any attempt to 'deal' with this gang of mass murderers is reminiscent of the attempt to 'deal' with Hitler." It said that in these difficult days, the people understand this: "You cannot deal with a brutal ruling class that desires to dominate the world. The only 'deal' is to defeat it."
    Referring to the recent fierce disputes within the American ruling class over the Vietnam policy, the article pointed out that the remarks of Senators Mansfield and Fulbright, the "New York Times" and Lippmann, General Gavin, and General Ridgway show that "their basic assessment is: the United States cannot win this war, and if the United States continues to vigorously wage this war, the result will be heavy political and military losses."
    The article said that the reason these big shots are arguing "is because the Vietnamese people are fighting bravely and hard—because they are winning—and because the sentiment against the Johnson group in the United States is rising rapidly. In order to expand these differences and utilize these differences for the benefit of our people and the Vietnamese people, we must expand militant activities around the policy of immediate withdrawal from Vietnam."

    美国进步劳工党主席罗森指出约翰逊“和平”攻势已遭惨败
    美国人民扩大斗争要求美军撤出越南
    苏联领导假支持手法掩盖不了充当美帝掮客的面目
    新华社十八日讯　纽约消息：美国进步劳工党主席密尔顿·罗森在二月十五日一期《挑战》周报上发表一篇文章指出，尽管有赫鲁晓夫修正主义者充当掮客，美帝国主义的“和平”攻势还是遭到了可耻的破产。
    文章写道，“骗人的‘和平攻势’已告结束。约翰逊集团妄图用讹诈手段迫使越南人民放弃争取自由的斗争，这种尝试已失败。
      “约翰逊力图向全世界表明，美国是在‘真诚地为和平而努力’，这一可怜的尝试就象一个铅制的气球那样上不了天。
      “约翰逊要欺骗美国人民的阴谋失败了。现在，更多的人士投入了要求美国立即滚出越南的活动！”“越南人民在虚假的‘和平宣传’面前所表现出来的坚定性、革命的勇气和团结，给全世界树立了一个良好的榜样。”
    文章接着写道，“在约翰逊玩弄骗局期间，（美国）报纸上一片痴心妄想，以为苏联通过这种或那种办法终将会把越南人诱骗来同约翰逊集团举行谈判。苏联表示‘支持’越南立场的声明不管多么剑拔弩张，美国报纸却始终了解这些声明的实质：（它们不过是）替苏联充当美帝国主义掮客这个基本作用打掩护的花招。”
    文章指出，美国恢复对越南北方的轰炸“只是突出表明了约翰逊集团的欺骗。它再一次表明，他们正不惜一切代价地妄图赖在越南。要同这一伙大规模杀人的匪帮‘打交道’的任何尝试都使人想起同希特勒‘打交道’的尝试”。它说，在这些困难的日子里，人民懂得了这一点：“你不能同一个渴望统治全世界的凶残的统治阶级打交道。唯一的‘交道’就是打败它”。
    谈到美国统治阶级内部最近围绕侵越政策所爆发的激烈争吵时文章指出，参议员曼斯菲尔德和富布赖特之流，《纽约时报》和李普曼、加文将军和李奇微将军等人的言论表明，“他们的基本估计是：美国打不赢这场战争，如果美国继续大力进行这场战争，其结果将是在政治上和军事上遭受惨重的损失”。
    文章说，这些大人物之间所以发生争吵，“是由于越南人民打得英勇，打得狠——因为他们正在赢得胜利——是由于美国国内反对约翰逊集团的情绪正在迅速高涨。为了扩大这些分歧并且出于我国人民和越南人民的利益而利用这些分歧，我们必须围绕立即撤出越南的方针，扩大战斗性的活动。”
