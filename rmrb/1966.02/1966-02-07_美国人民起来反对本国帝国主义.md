    American People Rise Up Against Their Own Imperialism
    By Our Commentator
    On February 5th, in many cities across the United States, large groups of people held demonstrations chanting slogans such as "Stop the Vietnam War, Bring the Troops Home." This is a strong protest and powerful denunciation by the broad masses of the American people against the Johnson government's crimes of resuming bombing of North Vietnam and intensifying the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    Since last year, the American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam has been surging forward wave upon wave. This unprecedented mass struggle has severely hit the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism. In the capitalist fortress of the United States, it has pierced the long night and declared to the world that the American people are moving towards a new awakening. This great demonstration by the American people has pushed the anti-war movement to a new high.
    The American people are a great people. In history, they have opposed imperialist wars of aggression more than once. In the Second World War, they rose up against the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists. Today is different. The broad masses of the American people are rising up against U.S. imperialism, against their own imperialism. This phenomenon is unprecedented in American history. This is a revolutionary and profound change.
    The American reactionaries are teachers by negative example for the people of all countries, and also teachers by negative example for the American people. The Johnson government's crimes of expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam have promoted a new awakening among the American people. The ruthless reality has opened the eyes of the American people, making them see that this dirty war can only bring them endless disasters. The constant increase in military spending for the war of aggression against Vietnam means that the American people have to tighten their belts. Constantly increasing troops on the Vietnam battlefield means pushing more American youths to their deaths, plunging more working people's families into the abyss of pain. With the failure and expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the Johnson government is intensifying fascism at home. The basic rights of the broad masses of American workers, peasants, black people, young students, and intellectuals will be deprived step by step. It is precisely under these circumstances that the people of all strata in the United States cannot but unite and struggle against U.S. imperialism. It is also precisely under these circumstances that the American people are increasingly merging their anti-war storm with the torrent of the world's people's struggle against U.S. imperialism, making their struggle an integral part of the international anti-U.S. united front.
    The American people are a hopeful people. Although their struggle is very arduous and they still face many difficulties, as long as they are not intimidated by violence, are not deceived, advance wave upon wave, and persist in their struggle, the American people will surely become the masters of the United States. As Chairman Mao Zedong said in his "Letter to Comrade Foster": "The night has an end. The American reactionary forces are now hitting walls everywhere, showing that their lifespan will not be very long. The current situation where the enemy is strong and we are weak is completely temporary, and it will surely change in the opposite direction." In fact, the American people's just struggle is by no means isolated. The Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the people of the whole world stand on the side of the American people. The struggles of the people of all countries against U.S. imperialism are powerful support for the American people.
    With the "gradual escalation" of U.S. imperialism's war of aggression against Vietnam, its attack on the American people will also gradually escalate, and the class contradictions within the United States will inevitably become more acute. In the practice of class struggle, the level of consciousness and organization of the American people will surely be further enhanced. Greater changes may occur in American society. More new things will appear

    美国人民起来反对本国帝国主义
    本报评论员
    本月五日，在美国的许多城市，大批群众高呼
  “停止越南战争，把军队撤回来”等口号，举行了示威。这是广大美国人民对约翰逊政府在越南北方恢复轰炸、加紧扩大侵越战争罪行的强烈抗议和有力声讨。
    去年以来，美国人民反对侵越战争的运动此伏彼起，汹涌澎湃，后浪推前浪，一浪接一浪。这个空前规模的群众斗争，沉重地打击了美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，在资本主义堡垒的美国，划破了多年来的沉沉黑夜，向全世界宣告，美国人民正在走向新的觉醒。这次美国人民的大示威，又把反战运动推向了新的高潮。
    美国人民是伟大的人民。在历史上，他们曾经不止一次地反对过帝国主义的侵略战争。在第二次世界大战中，他们起来反对过德意日法西斯。今天不同了。美国的广大群众起来反对的是美帝国主义，是本国的帝国主义。这种现象在美国历史上是空前的。这是一个具有革命性的深刻变化。
    美国反动派是世界各国人民的反面教员，也是美国人民的反面教员。约翰逊政府扩大侵越战争的罪行，促进了美国人民的新觉醒。无情的现实擦亮了美国人民的眼睛，使他们看清了这场肮脏的战争，只能带给他们无穷的灾难。侵越军费不断增加，就是要美国人民勒紧裤带。在越南战场上不断增兵，就是要把更多的美国青年推向死亡，使更多的美国劳动人民的家庭陷入痛苦的深渊。随着侵越战争的失败和扩大，约翰逊政府在国内加紧实行法西斯化，美国广大工人、农民、黑人、青年学生和知识分子的基本权利，就要一步一步被剥夺。正是在这种情况下，美国广大阶层的人民，不能不团结起来，同美帝国主义进行斗争。也正是在这种情况下，美国人民日益把他们的反战风暴同世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争洪流汇合在一起，使自己的斗争成为国际反美统一战线的一个组成部分。
    美国人民是很有希望的人民。尽管他们的斗争十分艰巨，他们还面临着重重困难，但是，只要不畏强暴，不受欺骗，前赴后继，坚持斗争，美国人民就一定会成为美国的主人。正如毛泽东主席在《给福斯特同志的回信》中所说：“黑夜是有尽头的。美国反动势力现已到处碰壁，显示着他们的寿命不会很长了。你们那里目前敌强我弱这种形势，完全是暂时的现象，它一定会向相反的方向起变化。”实际上，美国人民的正义斗争决不是孤立的。越南人民、中国人民和全世界人民，都站在美国人民一边。各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，都是对于美国人民的有力支持。
    随着美帝国主义侵越战争的“逐步升级”，它对美国人民的进攻也要逐步升级，美国国内的阶级矛盾必然更加尖锐化。在阶级斗争的实践中，美国人民的觉悟程度和组织程度，一定会更加提高。美国社会有可能发生更大的变动。北美大陆地平线上还要出现更多的新事物。美国人民反对本国帝国主义斗争的风暴必将有更大的兴起。
