    New Construction New Products
    Successful Research and Development of Two Modern Dustproof Equipments
    Medium-efficiency and high-efficiency air filters and air shower devices have been successfully trial-produced, providing favorable conditions for China's development of science and technology to solve air purification and ultra-purification problems.
    Two modern scientific and technological dust-proof equipments—medium-efficiency and high-efficiency air filters and air shower devices—have been successfully researched and developed by the Building Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. Their main performances have reached the international advanced level.
    With the development of science and technology and modern industry, the requirements for air cleanliness are getting higher and higher. For example, in the graduation workshop of some extremely precise instrument factories, hundreds or even thousands of lines must be engraved within a length of one millimeter. If a grain of dust falls during the engraving process, the quality cannot be guaranteed. Other examples include the smelting of high-purity metals, the rolling of ultra-thin and ultra-thin alloys, the production of ultra-micro electronic tubes and ultra-micro bearings, and the testing and production of radioactive chemical industry and medical and health products, all require highly clean air environment. Workshops producing these products usually use low, medium, and high efficiency filters to filter the air entering the workshop in three stages. In addition, air shower devices should be installed at the entrance of the workshop to remove dust attached to the work clothes and exposed parts of the body of the staff to ensure the high cleanliness of the air in the workshop.
    In the past, China could only produce low-efficiency coarse filters. The successful research and trial production of medium-efficiency and high-efficiency air filters and air shower devices have provided favorable conditions for China to develop science and technology to solve air purification and ultra-purification problems.
    At present, these equipments have been handed over to relevant factories in Beijing for production as a scientific research and production "relay race" project.
    Chongqing Makes Automatic Inspection Machine for Steel Ball Surface Defects
    Chongqing has recently successfully trial-produced an automatic inspection machine for steel ball surface defects, realizing the mechanization of steel ball inspection work.
    Among the several processes of inspecting steel balls in our country, dimensional classification, finish, roundness, and pressure have long been mechanized. Only the inspection of surface defects is currently done manually, which has low work efficiency and is prone to misdetection and missed detection. With the automatic inspection machine for steel ball surface defects, even small dots on the surface of the steel ball that are equivalent to half the diameter of a hair can be accurately selected, and the inspection efficiency can be greatly improved.
    This inspection machine was jointly designed and manufactured by Chongqing University and Chongqing Bearing Factory.
    Shanxi Newly Built a Pair of Modern Large Mines
    Shuiyu Mine, a newly built mine in the Fenxiao Coalfield of Shanxi Province, has recently been officially put into production.
    This modern large mine, which can produce 900,000 tons of raw coal per year, was designed by our country independently, and its complete set of mechanized equipment is also domestically produced.
    The workers who built this large mine thoroughly implemented the principle of closely combining revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific attitude throughout the entire mine construction process, broke foreign dogmas and old frameworks, and carried out technical revolutions and scientific experiments on a large scale, thus achieving "good" first and quality first. After strict inspection and verification, the quality of the mine roadway engineering, transportation equipment, mechanical and electrical equipment, ventilation and drainage equipment, and construction and installation engineering of these two mines have all reached the prescribed standards.

    新建设  新产品
    两种现代防尘设备研究成功
    中效、高效空气过滤器和空气吹淋装置试制成功，为我国发展科学技术解决空气净化和超净化问题，提供了有利条件
    现代科学技术需要的两种防尘设备——中效、高效空气过滤器和空气吹淋装置，已经在冶金工业部建筑研究院研究成功。它们的主要性能，都达到了国际先进水平。
    随着科学技术和近代工业的发展，对空气洁净度的要求也愈来愈高。例如，某些极为精密的仪表工厂的刻度车间，要在一毫米的长度内刻上几百条甚至成千条线，要是在刻度的时候掉上一粒灰尘，质量就不能保证了。其他如高纯金属的冶炼、特细特薄合金的轧制、超微型电子管和超微型轴承的生产，以及放射性化学工业和医药卫生等产品的试验和生产等等，都要求在高度洁净的空气环境中进行。生产这些产品的车间，通常都采用低、中、高三种效率的过滤器对进入车间的空气进行三级过滤。另外，在车间入口的地方，还要安装空气吹淋装置，清除工作人员工作服及人体裸露部分附着的灰尘等等，以便保证车间空气的高度洁净。
    过去，我国只能生产低效率的粗过滤器。中效、高效空气过滤器和空气吹淋装置的研究试制成功，为我国发展科学技术解决空气净化和超净化问题，提供了有利条件。
    目前，这些设备已经作为科研生产“接力赛”项目，交给北京市有关工厂安排生产。
    重庆制成钢球表面缺陷自动检验机
    重庆最近试制成功了钢球表面缺陷自动检验机，实现了钢球检验工作机械化。
    我国在检验钢球的几道工序中，尺寸分类、光洁度、圆度、压强等都早已实现了机械化，只有检验表面缺陷目前还是人工操作，工作效率低，而且容易误检和漏检。有了钢球表面缺陷自动检验机，在钢球表面上即使有相当于一根头发丝直径一半的小点点，也能准确地选出来，检验效率也可以大大提高。
    这种检验机是由重庆大学和重庆轴承厂共同设计制造的。
    山西新建成一对现代化大型矿井
    山西省汾孝煤田上新建的水峪矿井已在最近正式投入生产。
    这对每年能生产九十万吨原煤的现代化大型矿井，是我国自行设计的，它的全套机械化设备也都是国产的。
    建设这对大型矿井的职工们在整个建井过程中自始至终贯彻了革命干劲同科学态度紧密结合的原则，大破洋教条、老框框，大搞技术革命和科学实验，因而做到了好字当头、质量第一。经过严格的检验证明，这对矿井的井巷工程，以及运输设备、机电设备、通风和排水设备，建筑安装工程质量都达到了规定标准。
