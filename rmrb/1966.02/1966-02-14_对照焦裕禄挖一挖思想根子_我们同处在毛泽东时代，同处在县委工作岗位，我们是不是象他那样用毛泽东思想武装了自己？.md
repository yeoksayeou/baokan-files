    In Contrast to Jiao Yulu, Dig Deep into the Roots of Our Thinking
    We Are in the Same Mao Zedong Era, in the Same County Committee Work Positions, Are We Armed with Mao Zedong Thought Like Him?
    The more I read about Comrade Jiao Yulu's exemplary deeds, the more my heart burns, the more I think, the more uneasy I feel: We are in the same Mao Zedong era, in the same county committee work positions, do our leading cadres in Chang'an County arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought like Comrade Jiao Yulu? Do we dedicate our lives to the people with all our heart and soul for the Party and the people, with our hearts closely linked to the people, like him? Do we have his exemplary actions and style? Do we have his good working methods?
    Judging from these aspects, we have a big gap compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu. In addition to thinking methods and working methods, first of all, there is a big gap in ideological awareness. This requires us to compare ourselves with Comrade Jiao Yulu, dig deep into the roots of our thinking, and open our "burden" for inspection. At present, among our leading cadres, there are few who regard revolutionary work as holding "official" positions, reaching out for "official" positions, and only wanting good treatment for themselves, but there are some who hold on to the thought of protecting their "official" positions. Compared with the thinking of "the son of a poor peasant" Comrade Jiao Yulu, this is really a world of difference. With this kind of wrong thinking, one will not actively support good things, nor resolutely oppose bad things; one will not dare to raise questions that others have not raised, nor dare to do things that others have not done. In dealing with the relationship between superiors, subordinates, and comrades around, one does not talk about principles, but only about personal relationships, saying what is convenient for you is convenient for me. No struggle, but value harmony. Just like the kind of people criticized by Chairman Mao in "Rectify the Party's Style," they have also brought the vulgar style of the bourgeoisie into the Communist Party. We also sometimes take our small families and small lives too seriously, and some want to live a "comfortable life." Therefore, the position that the Party and the people occupy in our minds is sometimes smaller. We are also a little too concerned about our bodies. Sometimes when we are a little sick, we feel terrible in our minds, and we ask not to go to the countryside, and to have lighter and less work. It should be said that these ideological manifestations are bourgeois individualism. If we do not consciously overcome it, we will not be energetic in our work; our views and ideas will be conservative, and we will be afraid of this and that, and we will not dare to make progress; we will value harmony and will not dare to carry out ideological struggle. People with this kind of mental state will certainly find it difficult to be a leader, unable to unite and lead the masses to advance bravely, and impossible to make any contribution to the Chinese and world revolution.
    I myself am even worse than Comrade Jiao Yulu. I have more "fear" and less "dare" in my thoughts; my style is not hard-working, down-to-earth, and in-depth enough. Now, I am determined to arm my mind with Mao Zedong Thought, squeeze out non-proletarian thoughts, learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's good example, consciously transform myself, repeatedly transform myself, transform myself for a lifetime, and transform myself into a cadre like Comrade Jiao Yulu as soon as possible.
    Chang'an County has undergone tremendous changes in all aspects after the socialist education movement, and was rated as a red flag at the Northwest Region Agricultural Experience Exchange Conference. However, many aspects of our work are just beginning, and there are still many shortcomings, so we must not be complacent. We express this attitude to the Party: We will resolutely, under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's example, with a hundredfold confidence and tenacious revolutionary spirit, with the spirit of not being overwhelmed by honor, not being overwhelmed by tasks, not being overwhelmed by wind and rain, and not being frightened by difficulties, rely on the people of the whole county to continue working hard.

    对照焦裕禄挖一挖思想根子
    我们同处在毛泽东时代，同处在县委工作岗位，我们是不是象他那样用毛泽东思想武装了自己？
    我读焦裕禄同志的模范事迹，越读心越热，越想心越不安：我们同处在毛泽东时代，同处在县委工作岗位，我们长安县的领导干部是不是象焦裕禄同志那样用毛泽东思想武装了自己？是不是象他那样一心一意为党为人民，和人民群众心贴着心，把一生献给人民？有没有他那样的模范行动和作风？有没有他那样好的工作方法？
    从这些方面来看，我们同焦裕禄同志比，有着很大差距，除了思想方法、工作方法以外，首先是思想意识上有很大差距。这就要求我们对照焦裕禄同志，挖一挖思想根子，打开“包袱”检查一下。目前在我们这些领导干部中，把干革命工作看作当“官”、伸手要“官”、光想自己有好的待遇的人是为数不多的，但是保“官”思想却有一些。这和“贫农的儿子”焦裕禄同志的思想比，真是差之千里。有了这种错误思想，就对好事不积极支持，对坏事不坚决反对；别人没提过的问题不敢提，别人没做过的事不敢做。在处理上下左右同志之间的关系上，不讲原则，只讲个人关系，说什么你方便，我也方便。不要斗争，以和为贵。正象毛主席在《整顿党的作风》中批判的那种人，把资产阶级的庸俗作风也搬进共产党里来了。我们对于自己的小家庭、小日子有时也看得重了一些，有些想过“舒服日子”。因此，党和人民在头脑中占的位置有时也就小了些。我们也有些过于看重自己的身体。有时有点病，思想上就觉得不得了，要求不下乡，工作要轻、要少。应当说，这些思想表现就是资产阶级个人主义。如果我们不自觉地去克服它，工作起来就没有干劲；看问题、出主意会保守，就怕这怕那，不敢进取；就会以和为贵，不敢开展思想斗争。有这种精神状态的人，当然也就难以做一个带头人，无法团结和带领群众奋勇前进，不可能为中国和世界革命作出什么贡献。
    我自己跟焦裕禄同志比，更差一大节子。我思想上的“怕”字多，“敢”字少；作风上不够艰苦、踏实、深入。现在，我下定决心，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，把非无产阶级思想挤出去，学焦裕禄同志的好榜样，自觉改造，反复改造，改造一辈子，尽快变自己为焦裕禄同志那样的干部。
    长安县经过社会主义教育运动，各方面都有了巨大的变化，在西北地区农业经验交流会议上被评为红旗。可是，我们许多方面的工作才是开始，还有不少缺点，绝对不能骄傲自满。我们向党表示这样的态度：坚决在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，学焦裕禄同志的榜样，以百倍信心和顽强的革命精神，凭着荣誉夸不倒、任务压不倒、风雨打不倒、困难吓不倒的精神，依靠全县人民群众，干下去。
