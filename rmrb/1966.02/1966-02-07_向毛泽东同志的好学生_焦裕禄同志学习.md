    Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, Comrade Mao Zedong’s Good Student

    As a Party county committee secretary, Comrade Jiao Yulu is an outstanding representative. With his immortal deeds, he has once again proven a truth: only by arming oneself with Mao Zedong Thought can one serve the people completely and thoroughly, and only then can one correctly lead the masses of people, overcome all kinds of difficulties, and strive for great victory.

    Comrade Jiao Yulu was the former county committee secretary of Lankao County, Henan Province. When he took up this post, it was the year that Lankao County suffered from three major disasters: waterlogging, wind and sand, and saline-alkali soil, and its grain output had fallen to the lowest level in history. It was also when he himself was suffering from a serious illness. With a dauntless revolutionary spirit, Comrade Jiao Yulu used correct leadership methods to fight tenaciously against the severe natural disasters together with the cadres and masses of the entire county, and finally changed the face of Lankao County.

    What force enabled this county committee secretary, who came from a hired laborer background, to have such great courage and such great determination, and to lead practically and conscientiously in solving the urgent problems of hundreds of thousands of people in a county? It is Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Jiao Yulu’s stance, viewpoint, and method of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is a model worthy of our eternal study.

    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that communists must have the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, not for fame, not for profit, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death, wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people, serving the Chinese people and the people of the world completely and thoroughly, being infinitely loyal to the revolution, and devoting themselves to the people until their dying day. To learn Mao Zedong Thought, we must first learn this point.

    Comrade Jiao Yulu is a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong. He went to work in Lankao County with extremely deep class feelings and with a thorough revolutionary spirit. Despite being tormented by a serious illness, he still persevered in his work, disregarding his own safety. When the wind and sand were at their worst, he took the lead in checking the wind gaps and exploring the quicksand; when the heavy rain was pouring, he took the lead in observing the flow of the flood; when the wind and snow came overwhelmingly, he led the cadres to visit the poor and ask about their difficulties, and to send relief grain and funds to the poor and lower-middle peasants. He led by example, maintained the true qualities of the working people, was hardworking and simple, and opposed privileges. He treated people sincerely, was good at uniting comrades, and was a good “squad leader.” He was full of revolutionary optimism. From the serious difficulties of Lankao County, he saw great hope and great potential, and inspired the fighting will of the cadres and masses of the entire county. He disregarded his increasingly serious liver cancer, endured severe pain, and persisted in his work. Comrade Jiao Yulu demonstrated the noble character of a communist. He deserves to be called "a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person free from base interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people," as Comrade Mao Zedong said.

    We communists have no interests other than the interests of the proletariat and the working people. What communists think about is only the working class, only the vast majority of the people. Comrade Jiao Yulu said it well: "Communist Party members should appear in front of the masses when the masses are in the most difficult times." He said so, and he did so. His actions are a model of the selflessness of communists. Only revolutionaries with such qualities can truly creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. A person who is full of individualism and who plans for personal gain in everything he does can read Comrade Mao Zedong’s books, and even recite the words in them, but he can never truly act according to Mao Zedong Thought. The stance, viewpoint, and method of Mao Zedong Thought are consistent. Only comrades who possess a thorough revolutionary stance can more easily learn Mao Zedong Thought, learn correct leadership methods and work methods. Comrade Jiao Yulu’s words and deeds prove this most clearly.

    In order to change the face of Lankao County, Comrade Jiao Yulu’s first task was to grasp the ideological revolutionization of the people, first of all, to grasp the ideological revolutionization of leading cadres, especially the ideological revolutionization of the leading core. He clearly saw that "the key at present lies in changing the thinking of the county committee's leading core." He used the method of grasping the revolutionization of the leading core to mobilize all the cadres and rely closely on the people of the entire county to launch an arduous struggle against natural disasters.

    In order to change the face of Lankao County, Comrade Jiao Yulu carried out a series of investigations and research. Comrade Jiao Yulu fully understood that only by understanding the objective conditions and natural laws of Lankao County would it be possible to find the correct path to transform it. He threw himself into the work of investigation and research, disregarding his own safety. He had such a grand plan: to thoroughly understand the natural conditions of the 1,800 square kilometers of land in Lankao County, and to personally weigh how much the Lankao "three harms" actually weighed. In this work, he had a famous saying: "Eating steamed buns that others have chewed is tasteless." He personally braved wind, sand, rain, and snow to conduct investigations and grasp first-hand materials. This is the work attitude and work method that Comrade Mao Zedong has always advocated. In more than a year, he traveled to more than 120 of the 149 large teams in the county. It was precisely such arduous, systematic, and comprehensive investigation and research that enabled Comrade Jiao Yulu to propose a practical plan to change the face of Lankao.

    In order to change the face of Lankao County, Comrade Jiao Yulu mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, learned from the masses, and fought together with the masses. He concentrated the valuable experiences of the masses in fighting against natural disasters, bit by bit, into the common wealth of the people of the entire county, and became a powerful weapon for the people of the entire county to overcome disasters. In the struggle against disasters, he discovered that the people of Hancun still did not want the state's relief grain and relief funds after suffering a devastating flood, but relied on their own hands to produce and save themselves. He discovered that the Qinzhai Brigade was determined to transform all the saline-alkali land, one shovel at a time, like silkworms eating mulberry leaves. He discovered that Zhao Dulou overcame the difficulties of seven seasons of basically no harvest, insisted on hard work, and won a bumper harvest. He discovered that the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shuangyangshu insisted on taking the path of collectivization, "unbreakable by thunder," when the crops were basically not harvested. He summarized these typical experiences and summarized these creations of the masses into four sentences, which are: "The spirit of Hancun, the determination of Qinzhai, the drive of Zhao Dulou, and the path of Shuangyangshu." Comrade Jiao Yulu used in this way earnestly the leadership method of the mass line that Comrade Mao Zedong consistently advocated: the method of coming from the masses and going to the masses, and the method of concentrating and persisting.

    Comrade Jiao Yulu unified the stance, viewpoint, and method of Mao Zedong Thought and applied them to practical work, which established the strong leadership of the county party committee. With such leadership, combined with the broad masses of the people, we can create a moving and praiseworthy cause that turns the world upside down.

    Comrade Jiao Yulu’s deeds are a great inspiration to county party committee secretaries and leading cadres in all walks of life across the country. From Comrade Jiao Yulu, we can get a clear answer to the question of whom to serve. He has set an example for us of serving the people completely and thoroughly. From Comrade Jiao Yulu, we can also get a vivid answer to the question of how to serve the masses. He has set an example for us of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to solve the practical problems of our own region and department.

    Comrade Jiao Yulu is a good member of our Party and a good son of the Chinese people. By learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu’s work spirit and work methods, there will certainly be more Jiao Yulus, and there will certainly be more leading cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

### 向毛泽东同志的好学生——焦裕禄同志学习

    向毛泽东同志的好学生——焦裕禄同志学习
    作为党的县委书记，焦裕禄同志是一个出色的代表。他用自己不朽的事迹，又一次证明了一条真理：只有用毛泽东思想武装起来，才能够完全地彻底地为人民服务，才能够正确地领导人民群众，克服种种困难，争取伟大的胜利。
    焦裕禄同志是河南兰考县前县委书记。当他踏上这个岗位的时候，正是兰考县遭受内涝、风沙、盐碱三害，粮食产量下降到历史上最低水平的年头，也正是他本人患着严重疾病的时候。焦裕禄同志怀着大无畏的革命精神，运用正确的领导方法，同全县的干部群众一起，对深重的自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争，终于改变了兰考县的面貌。
    是什么力量使这位雇工出身的县委书记有这样大的勇气，这样大的决心，能够踏踏实实、兢兢业业地领导解决一个县几十万群众的迫切问题？是毛泽东思想。焦裕禄同志活学活用毛泽东思想的立场、观点和方法，是永远值得我们学习的榜样。
    毛泽东同志教导我们，共产党人要具有无产阶级的彻底革命精神，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民，完全、彻底地为中国人民和世界人民服务，对革命无限忠诚，为人民鞠躬尽瘁。学习毛泽东思想，首先要学习这一点。
    焦裕禄同志是毛泽东同志的好学生，他是带着无比深厚的阶级感情，带着彻底革命的精神到兰考县去工作的。尽管严重的疾病折磨着他，他还是奋不顾身地坚持工作。当风沙最大的时候，他带头去查风口，探流沙；当大雨瓢浇的时候，他带头察看洪水的流势；当风雪铺天盖地而来的时候，他率领干部访贫问苦，为贫下中农送救济粮款。他以身作则，保持着劳动人民的本色，艰苦朴素，反对特殊化。他诚恳待人，善于团结同志，当好了“班长”。他充满了革命的乐观主义，从兰考县的严重困难当中，看到大有希望，大有可为，鼓起全县干部和群众的斗争意志。他对自己越来越严重的肝癌置之度外，忍受剧痛，坚持工作。焦裕禄同志表现了一个共产党人的高贵品德。他不愧为毛泽东同志所说的“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人”。
    我们共产党人，除了无产阶级和劳动人民的利益以外，没有别的利益。共产党人想到的只是工人阶级，只是绝大多数人民群众。焦裕禄同志说得好：“共产党员应该在群众最困难的时候，出现在群众的面前。”他是这样说的，也是这样做的。他的所作所为，是共产党人的忘我精神的榜样。只有具有这样的品质的革命者，才能真正活学活用毛泽东思想。一个满脑子个人主义、事事处处为个人打算的人，他可以念毛泽东同志的书，甚至可以背诵其中的词句，但是他决不可能真正按照毛泽东思想办事。毛泽东思想的立场、观点、方法是一致的。只有具备了彻底革命立场的同志，才比较容易学到毛泽东思想，学到正确的领导方法和工作方法。焦裕禄同志的言行，最清楚不过地证明了这一点。
    为了改变兰考县的面貌，焦裕禄同志第一项工作就是抓人的思想革命化，首先是抓领导干部的思想革命化，特别是领导核心的思想革命化。他清楚地看到，“眼前关键在于县委领导核心的思想改变。”他用抓领导核心革命化的办法，把全体干部带动起来，紧紧依靠全县人民，同自然灾害展开一场艰巨的斗争。
    为了改变兰考县的面貌，焦裕禄同志进行了一系列的调查研究工作。焦裕禄同志完全懂得，只有认识了兰考县的客观条件和自然规律，才有可能找到改造它的正确道路。他奋不顾身地投入调查研究工作中。他有这样的雄图：要把兰考县一千八百平方公里土地上的自然情况摸透，亲自掂一掂兰考“三害”究竟有多大的份量。在这项工作当中，他有一句名言：“吃别人嚼过的馍没味道。”他亲自冒着风沙雨雪作调查，掌握第一手材料。这是毛泽东同志历来提倡的工作态度和工作方法。他在一年多的时间里，在全县一百四十九个大队中，跑遍了一百二十多个。正是这样艰苦的系统的全面的调查研究，使焦裕禄同志能够提出改变兰考面貌的切合实际的规划。
    为了改变兰考县的面貌，焦裕禄同志发动群众，依靠群众，向群众学习，同群众一起作斗争。他把群众同自然灾害斗争的宝贵经验，一点一滴地集中起来，成为全县人民的共同财富，成为全县人民战胜灾害的有力武器。在抗灾斗争当中，他发现了韩村人民在遭受毁灭性的涝灾之后，仍然不要国家的救济粮、救济款，而靠自己的双手生产自救。他发现了秦寨大队决心象蚕吃桑叶那样一锨一锨地改造全部盐碱地。他发现了赵垛楼战胜七季基本绝收的困难，坚持苦干，夺得丰收。他发现了双杨树的贫下中农，在农作物基本绝收的情况下，坚持走集体化的道路，“雷打不散”。他总结了这些典型经验，把群众的这些创造概括为四句话，这就是：“韩村的精神，秦寨的决心，赵垛楼的干劲，双杨树的道路。”焦裕禄同志就是这样认真地运用了毛泽东同志一贯提倡的群众路线的领导方法：从群众中来、到群众中去的方法，集中起来、坚持下去的方法。
    焦裕禄同志把毛泽东思想的立场、观点和方法统一地运用到实际工作中，这就建立起县委的强有力的领导。有了这样的领导，同广大人民群众结合在一起，就可以干出翻天覆地的可歌可泣的事业。
    焦裕禄同志的事迹，对于全国各地的县委书记同志和各行各业的领导干部，是一个巨大的启发。从焦裕禄同志身上，可以得到为谁服务的鲜明的答案，他为我们树立了一个完全、彻底地为人民服务的典范；从焦裕禄同志身上，也可以得到怎样为群众服务的生动的答案，他为我们树立了一个活学活用毛泽东思想，解决本地区、本部门的实际问题的典范。
    焦裕禄同志是我们党的好党员，是中国人民的好儿子。学习焦裕禄同志的工作精神和工作方法，一定会有更多的焦裕禄出现，一定会有更多的用毛泽东思想武装起来的领导干部出现。
