    Xinhua News Agency, February 4th Dispatch from Brussels: Belgian Communist Party Secretary Grippa published an article in the January 21st issue of the weekly "People's Voice," condemning Khrushchev revisionists for using the so-called "joint action" as a pretext to cover up their cooperation with US imperialism, the number one enemy of the world's people.
    Grippa's article was written to commemorate the 42nd anniversary of Lenin's death. Grippa said: "Lenin's writings condemned the traitorous leaders of the reformist Social Democrats, and also relentlessly condemned the current betrayal activities of Khrushchev revisionism.
      "When Khrushchevites without Khrushchev try to cover up their cooperation with US imperialism, the main fortress of world reaction, under the high-sounding guise of 'joint action,' they are merely copying the methods used by the traitors of the working class that Lenin criticized.
      "The Leninists exposed the betrayal activities of the reformist Social Democratic leaders, which enabled the world proletarian cause to experience a new leap forward. The Marxist-Leninists expose the betrayal activities of modern revisionism, which can strengthen their combat effectiveness and educate millions of new revolutionaries."
    Grippa emphasized: "US imperialism and its Social Democratic lackeys and revisionist collaborators will all be swept away by the storm of revolution." He said: "Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, the people of all countries have achieved one victory after another over imperialism. Just as the Tsar, the anti-Soviet 'cordon sanitaire' of British and French imperialism, Hitler imperialism, and Japanese militarism failed to prevent the revolution from achieving new victories in the past, US imperialism, which is currently the number one enemy of the people of the world, cannot and will not be able to do so in the future."
    Grippa also pointed out in his article: "At present, Leninism is inspiring the revolutionary actions of millions of people. The theory of Marxism-Leninism has been further developed and continues to be developed by revolutionary descendants who link theory with practice. Stalin was Lenin's successor. Mao Zedong has become a contemporary Lenin through his writings."
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 3rd Telegram: The Albanian newspaper "Warrior" published a commentary on the 3rd saying that the US aircraft's resumption of barbaric bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 31 once again exposed the hypocrisy of the Johnson administration's so-called "peace offensive."
    The commentary said that the Johnson administration is increasingly using a two-pronged policy: on the one hand, expanding the war of aggression, and on the other hand, engaging in "peace" scams. However, Johnson always fails in both of these aspects.
    The commentary pointed out that the Johnson administration is already surrounded by anger and hatred. The only ones who follow it are some vassal states, and only the Khrushchev revisionists are enthusiastically cooperating with it. The Khrushchev revisionists are making every effort to try to rescue the US imperialists from the quagmire they are trapped in. When the Johnson government resumed the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and was expanding the war of aggression in South Vietnam, the Khrushchev revisionists were conducting "friendly negotiations" with the US imperialists to sign a "non-proliferation of nuclear weapons" treaty, in order to maintain their nuclear monopoly, thereby realizing the conspiracy of the two major powers to dominate the world. In order to realize Soviet-US cooperation to dominate the world, the representatives of the Khrushchev revisionists participating in the Geneva "disarmament" talks did not say a word of condemnation for the crime of the United States resuming the bombing of the territory of a socialist country, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    比共书记格里巴谴责苏联领导以“联合行动”作幌子掩盖同美帝勾结
    美帝和现代修正主义阻挡不了世界革命的胜利
    阿《战士报》揭露赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为美帝侵越战争帮忙
    新华社四日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时共产党书记格里巴在一月二十一日的《人民之声》周刊上发表文章，谴责赫鲁晓夫修正主义者以所谓“联合行动”作幌子来掩盖他们同世界人民头号敌人美帝国主义的合作。
    格里巴的这篇文章是为纪念列宁逝世四十二周年而写的。格里巴说：“列宁的著作谴责了改良主义的社会民主党背叛的领导人，同时也无情地谴责赫鲁晓夫修正主义目前的背叛活动。
      “当没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫分子试图在冠冕堂皇的‘联合行动’幌子下掩盖他们同世界反动派的主要堡垒美帝国主义实行合作时，他们只不过是抄袭了列宁所批判过的工人阶级叛徒使用的办法。
      “列宁主义者揭露改良主义的社会民主党领导人的背叛活动，这就使世界无产阶级事业经历了新的跃进。马克思列宁主义者揭露现代修正主义的背叛活动，这就能加强自己的战斗力，教育千百万新的革命者。”
    格里巴强调指出：“美帝国主义及其社会民主党走狗和修正主义合作者，都将被革命的风暴扫除净尽。”他说：“在马克思列宁主义指导下的各国人民对帝国主义取得了一个又一个的胜利。正如沙皇、法英帝国主义的反苏‘防疫带’、希特勒帝国主义和日本军国主义过去没有能阻止革命取得新的胜利一样，目前成为全世界人民头号敌人的美帝国主义，现在不能、并且以后也不能作到这一点。”
    格里巴在文章中还指出：“目前，列宁主义鼓舞着千百万人的革命行动。马克思列宁主义的理论已经进一步得到了发展，而且继续被把理论和实际联系起来的革命后代所发展。斯大林是列宁的继承者。毛泽东通过他的著作而成了当代的列宁。”
    新华社地拉那三日电　阿尔巴尼亚《战士报》三日发表评论说，一月三十一日美国飞机恢复对越南民主共和国的野蛮轰炸再一次暴露了约翰逊政府的所谓“和平攻势”的虚伪性。
    评论说，约翰逊政府越来越多地使用两手政策：一手扩大侵略战争，另一手搞“和平”骗局。但是，约翰逊在这两方面总是都遭到失败。
    评论指出，约翰逊政府已经处于愤怒和仇恨的包围之中。追随它的只有某些仆从国家，只有赫鲁晓夫修正主义者热心同它合作。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者作出一切努力，企图把美帝国主义者从陷入的泥潭中挽救出来。当约翰逊政府恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸和正在扩大侵略南越的战争的时候，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者正在同美帝国主义者进行签订“不扩散核武器”条约的“友好谈判”，以便维持他们的核垄断，从而实现两个大国主宰世界的阴谋。为了实现苏美合作主宰世界，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者参加日内瓦“裁军”谈判的代表对美国恢复轰炸一个社会主义国家越南民主共和国的领土的罪行没有说半句谴责的话。
