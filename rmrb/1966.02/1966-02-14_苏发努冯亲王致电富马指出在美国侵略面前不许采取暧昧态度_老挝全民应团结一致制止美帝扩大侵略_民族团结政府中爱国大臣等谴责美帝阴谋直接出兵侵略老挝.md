    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 13th. According to Radio Pathet Lao's broadcast on the 11th, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front and Deputy Prime Minister of the Tripartite National Union Government of Laos, sent a telegram to Prince Souvanna Phouma on January 25th, hoping that he would truly stand on the patriotic position and join the Lao people in stopping the US imperialist conspiracy to directly send troops to invade Laos.

    The telegram pointed out that, in order to avoid its inevitable defeat in Indochina, US imperialism is planning to directly send its troops to occupy the central and lower Laos areas, and has already used B-52 strategic bombers to carry out murderous bombings against the Lao people, with the aim of turning this area into a bridgehead connecting its battlefield in South Vietnam with its military bases in Thailand. Obviously, this will bring new disasters to the Lao people.

    The telegram said that Prince Souvanna Phouma had recently expressed his opposition to US imperialism directly sending troops to invade Laos. The telegram pointed out that if this is Prince Phouma's true attitude, and he is determined to uphold this attitude regardless of the pressure from the American aggressors and their lackeys, the Lao people will welcome it.

    The telegram said that, however, at the same time as Prince Phouma made this statement, he contradictorily continued to echo US imperialist slanders against the Lao Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and openly said that the American robbers respect Laos' peace and neutrality. Therefore, "one cannot help but doubt the true motive behind this self-contradictory double-dealing."

    The telegram reminded Prince Phouma that US imperialism and its lackeys have already committed a large number of crimes against the Lao people over the past year. Despite this, US imperialism and its lackeys are not satisfied with this, nor do they trust him. The telegram asked Prince Phouma to see: "Once they think you are no longer of any use to them, they will abandon you as they have done to others."

    The telegram said that at this serious moment when US imperialism and its lackeys are conspiring to take evil actions against the Lao people, all compatriots have a duty to unite to oppose the American aggressors and save the motherland. It is impermissible to adopt an ambiguous, silent, and equivocal attitude, or even to play a double-dealing trick of false patriotism.

    Prince Souphanouvong finally said that the Lao Patriotic Front's position is unwavering: No matter what form of aggression US imperialism adopts against Laos—relying on the puppet regime and its army to carry out aggression against Laos, or directly sending troops to invade as it is currently planning—the Lao Patriotic Front will fight resolutely together with the Lao people to defend the highest interests of the people and the nation until the US imperialist aggression plan is thwarted and the entire motherland is liberated.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 12th. According to Radio Pathet Lao: The ministers and state secretaries of the Lao Patriotic Front and the patriotic neutral forces in the Tripartite National Union Government of Laos jointly issued a statement on the 7th, strongly condemning the US authorities' conspiracy to send US troops into Laos to expand the war of aggression against Laos.

    The statement said that US imperialism is doing its utmost to accelerate the implementation of a new military adventure plan, attempting to occupy central and lower Laos, connect it with South Vietnam and Thailand, and turn it into a springboard for the United States to expand the war to the entire Indochina, in order to suppress the Southeast Asian national liberation movement.

    The statement pointed out, "Even if US imperialism sends tens of thousands of US troops to Laos and turns Laos into a second battlefield, then this place, located next to South Vietnam, is precisely the second graveyard for burying the American aggressor troops."

    The statement said, "The patriotic members of the National Union Government once again reiterate: the four-point position and five proposals of the National Political Consultative Conference are the only basis for restoring peace in Laos; at the same time, they warmly support the statement issued by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front on January 17, 1966."

    The statement called on all Lao people, regardless of political views or religious beliefs, to unite as one, rally around the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and the patriotic members of the Tripartite National Union Government, and wholeheartedly and resolutely carry out the patriotic struggle to resist American aggression.

    The statement was signed by: Prince Souphanouvong, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Economy and Planning of the Lao National Union Government; Khamsouk Keola, Minister of Health and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs; Phoumi Vongvichit, Minister of Information, Propaganda and Tourism; Chao Souvanna Phouma, State Secretary of Public Works and Transportation; Lieutenant General Heuan Mongkhonvilay, State Secretary of Veterans Affairs; and Khamphèng Boupha, State Secretary of National Economy and Planning.

    苏发努冯亲王致电富马指出在美国侵略面前不许采取暧昧态度
    老挝全民应团结一致制止美帝扩大侵略
    民族团结政府中爱国大臣等谴责美帝阴谋直接出兵侵略老挝
    新华社康开十三日电　据巴特寮电台十一日广播，老挝爱国战线党主席、老挝三方民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王一月二十五日打电报给梭发那·富马亲王，希望他真正站到爱国立场上来，同老挝人民一起制止美帝国主义阴谋直接派兵侵略老挝。
    电报指出，美帝国主义为了免遭它在印度支那的不可避免的覆灭，正在策划直接派它的军队侵占老挝中寮和下寮地区，并且已经使用B—52型战略轰炸机对老挝人民进行屠杀性的轰炸，其目的是要把这个地区变成把它在南越的战场同它在泰国的军事基地联接起来的桥头堡。显然，这一定会给老挝人民带来新的灾难。
    电报说，梭发那·富马亲王不久以前曾经表示反对美帝国主义直接派兵侵略老挝。电报指出，如果这是富马亲王的真正态度，并决心不顾美国侵略者及其走狗的压力坚持这一态度，老挝人民将表示欢迎。
    电报说，然而在富马亲王发表这种声明的同时，却又自相矛盾地不断附和美帝国主义对老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国进行诽谤，并且公然说什么美国强盗是尊重老挝的和平和中立的。因此，“人们不禁要怀疑这种自相矛盾的两面手法的真正动机”。
    电报提醒富马亲王注意到，美帝国主义及其走狗一年多来已经利用他对老挝人民犯下了大量的罪行。尽管如此，美帝国主义及其走狗并不以此满足，也并不信任他。电报要求富马亲王看到：“一旦他们认为你对他们不再有任何用处的时候，他们就会象对其他的人所做的那样，把你抛弃掉。”
    电报说，在美帝国主义及其走狗阴谋对老挝人民采取罪恶活动的这个严重时刻，全体同胞有义务团结起来，反对美国侵略者和拯救祖国。采取暧昧、沉默和模棱两可的态度，甚至玩弄假爱国的两面手法都是不能容许的。
    苏发努冯亲王最后说，老挝爱国战线党的立场是坚定不移的：不管美帝国主义对老挝采取什么侵略形式——依靠傀儡政权及其军队进行对老挝的侵略，或者是象它目前所策划的直接出兵侵略，老挝爱国战线党将同老挝全国人民一道，坚决战斗，以捍卫人民和民族的最高利益，直到挫败美帝国主义的侵略计划和解放整个祖国为止。
    据新华社康开十二日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝三方民族团结政府中的老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量的各位大臣和国务秘书七日联合发表声明，强烈谴责美国当局阴谋派遣美军进入老挝，扩大对老挝的侵略战争。
    声明说，美帝国主义正在竭力加紧推行新的军事冒险计划，企图占领中寮和下寮，使它同越南南方和泰国连结一起，并且变成美国把战争扩大到整个印度支那的战争跳板，以便镇压东南亚民族解放运动。
    声明指出，“即使美帝国主义派遣成万名美军来到老挝，把老挝变成第二个战场，那么，这个位于越南南方旁边的地方，也正是埋葬美国侵略军的第二个坟场。”
    声明说，“民族团结政府的爱国成员再一次重申：全国政治协商会议的四点立场和五项主张，是恢复老挝和平的唯一基础；同时热烈支持老挝爱国战线党中央委员会一九六六年一月十七日发表的声明。”
    声明号召全体老挝人民，不分政治见解和宗教信仰，万众一心，团结在老挝爱国战线党中央和三方民族团结政府爱国成员的周围，全心全力，坚决地进行抗击美国侵略的救国斗争。
    在这项声明上署名的有：老挝民族团结政府副首相兼国民经济和计划大臣苏发努冯亲王，卫生大臣兼代理外交大臣坎苏·高拉，新闻、宣传和游览大臣富米·冯维希，公共工程和运输国务秘书昭苏·冯萨，退伍军人国务秘书昏·蒙昆维莱中将，国民经济和计划国务秘书坎芬·杜纳龙。
