　　Mao Zedong's Thought on People's War Inspires People's Confidence in Defeating U.S. Imperialism
　　Japanese Commentator Aochi Shin Writes that the History of the Chinese Revolution is a History of the Victory of the Mao Zedong Line
    Xinhua News Agency, February 26th Dispatch from Tokyo: A commentary published in the January issue of the Japanese bourgeois magazine "Chuo Koron" by commentator Aochi Shin pointed out that Chairman Mao Zedong's thought on people's war provides a theoretical basis and confidence for people in defeating U.S. imperialism.
    When discussing Chairman Mao's thought on people's war, Aochi wrote: The Beijing "People's Daily" published an article on September 3rd last year by Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao entitled "Long Live the Victory of People's War," which showed us the theoretical basis for this confidence. The main point of Lin Biao's article is that the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan proved that a weak country can ultimately defeat a strong country. "The CCP's strategy during the War of Resistance Against Japan was to build rural base areas, rely on the countryside, surround the cities occupied by the Japanese army, and finally seize the cities. The effectiveness of this strategy has also been fully proven in the civil war fought by the CCP against Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang army."
    The article says, "It can be considered that the history of the Chinese revolution is the history of the victory of the Mao Zedong line." "The focus of Lin Biao's article, namely, the countryside surrounding the cities, is the essence of Mao Zedong Thought, and is the thought that has become the blood and flesh of the old party members."
      "If the essence of Mao Zedong Thought is extended from China to the whole world, then the backward countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are equivalent to the world's countryside, and the advanced countries of the United States and Western Europe are equivalent to the world's cities. It can be considered that China has formulated a plan to establish a united front of the 'world's countryside' and strive for national liberation, surround the 'world's cities' headed by the United States, and finally seize the cities, that is, achieve the liberation of all nations."
    The article says, "Some people think that China has few and weak aircraft and nuclear weapons and is no match for the world's most powerful U.S. military. This view is too superficial. A country with inferior weapons can only wage a long-term protracted war in order to defeat a strong country. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mao Zedong put forward the view that political power is superior to military power in his article 'On Protracted War' and made a correct analysis and estimation. The fact is that the war situation developed completely according to his analysis and estimation. We need to recall this fact."
    The article says that China's "people's communes have full power from military force to educational institutions. Even if China is divided into countless pieces, the people's commune organization, which includes production, military affairs, and education, will still become a base for resistance, a cell. The greatest weapon for waging a protracted war is not weapons, but the power of a huge spiritual outlook composed of thousands upon thousands of cells symbolized by the people's communes. As long as these countless cells are not completely destroyed, it will be impossible to conquer China."

　　毛主席的人民战争思想鼓舞人们战胜美帝信心
　　日本评论家青地晨著文说中国革命史就是毛泽东路线的胜利史
    新华社二十六日讯　东京消息：日本资产阶级杂志《中央公论》一月号刊登评论家青地晨的一篇文章指出，毛泽东主席的人民战争思想，使人们在战胜美帝国主义的问题上得到了理论根据和信心。
    青地在谈到毛主席的人民战争思想时写道：北京“《人民日报》去年九月三日发表的副总理兼国防部长林彪的文章《人民战争胜利万岁》，向我们展现了这种信心的理论根据。林彪文章的要点就是：抗日战争的胜利证明，一个弱国能够最后战胜强国。”“中共在抗日战争时期的战略就是，建设农村根据地，依靠农村，包围被日军占领的城市，最后夺取城市。这种战略的有效性，也已经为中共同蒋介石的国民党军队打的内战中所充分证明。”
    文章说，“可以认为，中国革命的历史，就是毛泽东路线胜利的历史。”“林彪文章的重点，即农村包围城市，是毛泽东思想的精华，是已经成为老党员们的血和肉的思想。”
      “如果把毛泽东思想的精华从中国一国推广到全世界，那么，亚非各国和拉丁美洲的后进国家就相当于世界的农村，美国和西欧的先进国家则相当于世界的城市。可以认为，中国已经制订了一个计划，建立‘世界的农村’和争取民族解放的统一战线，包围以美国为首的‘世界的城市’，最后夺取城市，也就是实现各民族的解放。”
    文章说，“有人认为中国飞机和核武器都又少又弱，不是世界最强大的美军的对手。这种看法太肤浅了。一个武器不精良的国家，为了战胜强国，只有进行长期的持久战。抗日战争时期，毛泽东在《论持久战》一文中提出了政治力胜于军事力的观点，发表了正确的分析和估计。事实是，战局完全按着他的分析和估计发展。我们需要回忆一下这个事实。”
    文章说，中国的“人民公社，从兵力到教育机构，全权在握。即使中国被分割为无数块，包括了生产、军事和教育的人民公社组织，仍将照样成为一个抗战基地，一个细胞。进行持久战的最大武器，不是兵器，而是由人民公社所象征的成千上万个细胞构成的巨大的精神面貌的力量。只要不彻底摧毁这无数个细胞，要征服中国就是不可能的。”
