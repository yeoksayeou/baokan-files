    Ceylon Ambassador Gunawardena hopes for further development of friendly relations between Ceylon and China.
    Vice Premier Bo Yibo strongly condemns US imperialism's resumption of bombing of Vietnam, emphasizing that the Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people in thoroughly defeating US imperialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 4th. Ceylon Ambassador to China Gunawardena and his wife held a reception tonight to celebrate the 18th anniversary of Ceylon's independence.
    Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Yang Xiufeng, and others were invited to attend the reception.
    At the reception, Ceylon Embassy in China Counsellor Cruz read Ambassador Gunawardena's speech, and Vice Premier Bo Yibo gave a speech. In their speeches, they wished for further development of the friendship between the people of China and Ceylon.
    In his speech, Vice Premier Bo Yibo strongly condemned US imperialism's resumption of barbaric bombing of North Vietnam. He said that the US government, through its actions, has completely exposed its so-called "peace offensive" as a complete deception. Now that the hideous face of US imperialism has been fully exposed, the Vietnamese people are fighting more heroically, doubling their blows against the US aggressors. The barbaric aggression of US imperialism against Vietnam has aroused the righteous indignation of peace-loving countries and people around the world. The 650 million Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and will contribute to the thorough defeat of US imperialism.
    Ambassador Gunawardena's speech introduced Ceylon's efforts in construction. He said that since independence, the Ceylon government has strived to unite the people to strive for economic autonomy based on the principle of self-reliance.
    The ambassador said that in international relations, Ceylon has consistently pursued a policy of peaceful coexistence, non-alignment, and neutrality. We adhere to the principle that no country, regardless of its size, strength, or wealth of resources, has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. We firmly believe that people should have the right to choose their system of government.
    He said that today imperialism is once again embarking on the road of war, and the inescapable responsibility of all peace-loving countries is to shout "stop" to them. We oppose imperialism, oppose colonialism and neo-colonialism.
    The ambassador said that Ceylon and China's long-standing ties have been regenerated and consolidated in an atmosphere of goodwill and friendship. We strongly hope that this friendship will be further developed to the mutual benefit of the people of both the People's Republic of China and Ceylon.
    In his speech, Vice Premier Bo Yibo said that the people of China and Ceylon have a traditional and profound friendship, and the people of the two countries have lived in harmony for generations. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Ceylon, the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries have continued to develop on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference. Over the past ten years, China and Ceylon have signed one trade agreement and economic and technical cooperation agreement after another, and economic cooperation between the two countries is progressing smoothly; mutual visits of various cultural and friendly delegations between our two countries have strengthened the friendship and understanding between the people of the two countries.
    Vice Premier Bo Yibo emphasized that the friendly cooperation between China and Ceylon is based on equality and mutual benefit and is in the interests of the people of both countries. We sincerely hope that with the joint efforts of the governments and people of the two countries, this friendly and cooperative relationship will continue to achieve new development.
    Also invited to attend the reception were responsible persons from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other relevant government departments, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, people's organizations, democratic parties, and Beijing.

    锡兰大使举行独立十八周年招待会
    古纳瓦德纳大使希望锡中两国友好关系进一步发展。
    薄一波副总理强烈谴责美帝恢复轰炸越南，强调中国人民坚决支持越南人民彻底打败美帝。
    新华社四日讯　锡兰驻中国大使古纳瓦德纳和夫人今晚举行招待会，庆祝锡兰独立十八周年。
    薄一波副总理，林枫副委员长，政协全国委员会副主席高崇民，国防委员会副主席傅作义，最高人民法院院长杨秀峰等，应邀出席了招待会。
    在招待会上，锡兰驻中国大使馆参赞柯鲁斯宣读了古纳瓦德纳大使的讲话稿，薄一波副总理讲了话。他们在讲话中祝中锡两国人民的友谊进一步发展。
    薄一波副总理在讲话中强烈谴责美帝国主义恢复对越南北方的野蛮轰炸。他说，美国政府用自己的行动，彻底暴露了它的所谓“和平攻势”完全是一个骗局。现在，美帝国主义的狰狞面目已经完全暴露，越南人民正在更加英勇的战斗，加倍打击美国侵略者。美帝国主义对越南的野蛮侵略，激起了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的义愤。六亿五千万中国人民坚决支持越南人民的正义斗争，为彻底打败美帝国主义，作出自己的贡献。
    古纳瓦德纳大使的讲话介绍了锡兰在建设方面的努力。他说，独立以来，锡兰政府根据自力更生原则，尽力团结人民争取经济自主。
    大使说，在国际关系方面，锡兰一贯执行和平共处、不结盟和中立的政策。我们坚持这样的原则，即任何国家，不论其版图大小、力量强弱或资源贫富，都无权干涉一个主权国家的内政。我们坚信人民应当有权选择他们的政府制度。
    他说，今天帝国主义又踏上了战争的道路，一切爱好和平的国家不可推卸的责任是向他们大喝一声停步。我们反对帝国主义，反对殖民主义和新殖民主义。
    大使说，锡兰和中国的历史悠久的联系一直在亲善和友好的气氛中获得再生和巩固。我们强烈地希望，这种友谊将在对中华人民共和国和锡兰两国人民互利的情况下得到进一步的发展。
    薄一波副总理在讲话中说，中锡两国人民有着传统的深厚友谊，两国人民世世代代和睦相处。自从中锡建交以来，两国的友好合作关系，在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的基础上，不断地向前发展。十多年来，中锡两国签订了一个又一个的贸易协定和经济技术合作协定，两国间的经济合作正在顺利进行；我们两国间各种文化友好代表团的相互访问，加强了两国人民间的友谊和了解。
    薄一波副总理强调说，中锡两国的友好合作是建立在平等互利的基础上的，是符合两国人民的利益的。我们衷心地希望，在两国政府和人民的共同努力下，这种友好合作关系将不断取得新的发展。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有外交部和政府其他有关部门的负责人，中国人民解放军、人民团体、民主党派和北京市的负责人。他们当中有曾山、姚依林、韩念龙、楚图南、雷任民、张志让、吴德峰、潘振武、乐松生等。
