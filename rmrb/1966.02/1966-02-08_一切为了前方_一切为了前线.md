　　Everything for the Front, Everything for the Front Line
　　On a highway in North Vietnam, a convoy of vehicles loaded with supplies sped along, braving the enemy planes' frantic bombing and strafing. Beside the portrait of the hero Nguyen Van Troi, which hung in the driver's cabin, were posters with slogans such as "Learn from Nguyen Van Troi, win victories on the transportation line" and "Everything for the front, everything for victory." The drivers were like a flock of nimble eagles. Although they traveled day and night through the flames of war, in the past year, the entire convoy not only did not have a single vehicle destroyed by enemy planes, but also completed the transportation plan ahead of schedule.

　　At the convoy command post in a certain place, we met Nguyen Nhu Van, the convoy leader, who had just returned from the front. He was an outstanding driver who had participated in the Dien Bien Phu campaign, short and sturdy, full of combat vitality. In his hearty and humorous tone, he told us many moving stories of this convoy's fierce struggle with enemy planes.

　　Courage is Victory
　　Once, driver Nguyen Van Thoi was speeding along the highway in his beloved truck. The truck was loaded with supplies urgently needed at the front. He was as anxious as an arrow, hoping to reach his destination as soon as possible. Suddenly, a batch of enemy planes flew in from the sea and spotted the truck. At this moment, Nguyen Van Thoi was exceptionally calm. He instructed his assistant to closely monitor the enemy planes, while he himself gripped the steering wheel tightly, driving non-stop. The enemy planes dived down with piercing whistles. When his assistant shouted "Stop," he immediately slammed on the brakes. The rockets fired by the enemy planes exploded "boom, boom" in front of the truck, shrapnel wounding Nguyen Van Thoi's arm, causing it to bleed profusely. He paid no attention to the wound. When the enemy plane glided over his head, climbed high into the sky, and circled back, he immediately increased the throttle, continued speeding, drove the truck into a concealed location, and successfully completed the mission ahead of schedule. In the past year, almost every driver has experienced combat scenes like Nguyen Van Thoi and achieved the same victory. Now, the drivers all say with great pride: "American planes can only bully cowards. With courage, we are not afraid of them and can find ways to deal with them."

　　"Flares are Useless"
　　One night, Nguyen Nhu Van and two other trucks were driving back. When the trucks reached a long stretch of open ground, suddenly an alarm sounded, and enemy planes flew in. Then, a flash of light illuminated the surroundings of the vehicles, making everything vividly clear. The enemy planes dropped one flare after another. What to do? The enemy planes were about to circle back to bomb and strafe. Not a moment could be lost. Nguyen Nhu Van, who was in the lead truck, signaled to the two trucks behind him and resolutely accelerated, speeding away. When the enemy planes finished circling and dived down, they had already passed the illuminated area. The enemy planes missed, so they rushed in front of the trucks and continuously dropped several flares, trying to intercept the trucks for bombing. The meticulous and daring Nguyen Nhu Van surveyed the surrounding environment, calculated the speed of the trucks, and continued to move forward towards the flares. The enemy planes dived again and missed again. In this way, Nguyen Nhu Van and his comrades repeatedly played hide-and-seek with the enemy planes, running all the way across the open ground. After the trucks were concealed, the enemy planes were still buzzing and dropping flares overhead.

　　Nguyen Nhu Van told us: "At first, some young drivers were indeed a little flustered when they saw these bright things. After fighting with them a few times, everyone said: Flares are useless, they can't scare anyone!" Then, he humorously said that now the drivers hoped to encounter flares on the road, because they could help the drivers speed up!

　　Love the Vehicle as Life
　　Under the enemy planes' frantic bombing, ensuring the safety of the vehicles is the solemn oath that the drivers have made to the motherland. Their slogan is: "Love the vehicle as life, cherish the oil as blood."

　　Once, a convoy team crossed a river. All the other trucks passed smoothly, but one truck was inadvertently trapped in the water. The situation was very urgent: no one could be found on this side of the river to help pull the truck, and there were no boats to cross the river to find people at the time. This worried the driver of the truck very much. Despite the cool breeze and rapid currents that night, the driver took off his clothes and swam across the river. He reported the situation of the trapped truck to his comrades. So, after discussion, everyone swam across the river together, unloaded the supplies from the truck, and camouflaged the vehicle with branches. Although enemy planes constantly circled overhead the next day, they could not find the vehicle. Later, with the help of the people, the truck finally crossed the river safely.

　　Johnson wants to use "resumed bombing" to force the people of North Vietnam to submit. The American propaganda machine clamors to "crush" Vietnam "through air strikes." However, this kind of war blackmail cannot succeed against the heroic Vietnamese people. The news and reports published here on the transportation situation in North Vietnam provide powerful proof.

　　Tens of thousands of transport workers and engineering soldiers in North Vietnam, in the days of frenzied bombing by American planes, regarded the highways as battlefields and the vehicles as weapons, overcoming countless difficulties with dauntless heroism and ingenious methods, ensuring the smooth flow of the transport lines, so that the frontline soldiers could promptly obtain the various supplies needed to strike the American bandits.

　　The reason they can build an unbreakable and un-bombable steel transportation line is that they have a steel will to overwhelm American imperialism in spirit. This great spiritual power cannot be defeated by American bandits' planes and bombs, nor can it be understood by the likes of Johnson.

### 一切为了前方  一切为了前线

    一切为了前方  一切为了前线
    在越南北方的一条公路上，一队满载物资的车辆，冒着敌机的疯狂轰炸、扫射，风驰电掣般地行驶着。驾驶室挂着的英雄阮文追遗象两旁，贴着一幅幅标语，上面写着“学习阮文追，在交通线上打胜仗”、“一切为了前方，一切为了胜利”。司机们象一群矫健的雄鹰，尽管昼夜都穿行在战火之中，但近一年来，全车队不仅没有一辆车被敌机炸毁，而且提前完成了运输计划。
    在某地的车队指挥部里，我们见到了刚从前线返回的车队队长阮如云。他是曾经参加过奠边府战役的优秀司机，个子矮小而结实，浑身充满了战斗的活力。他以那爽朗而富有风趣的声调，向我们谈述了这个车队同敌机进行严酷斗争的许多动人事迹。
    勇敢就是胜利
    一次，司机阮文时正驾驶他心爱的卡车在公路上飞奔。车上装满前线急需的物资。他心急似箭，希望尽快赶到目的地。突然，一批敌机从海面飞来。发现了汽车。这时，阮文时异常镇定，他要助手密切监视敌机，自己仍然紧把方向盘，一刻不停地急驶。敌机带着刺耳的啸声俯冲下来了，助手喊声“停”，他就马上来个急刹车。敌机发射的火箭“轰，轰”在车前爆炸了，弹片打伤了阮文时的手臂，鲜血直流，他丝毫也没理会伤口，当敌机从头上滑过去，爬上高空兜圈子的时候，他立即加大油门，继续飞奔，把车开进隐蔽地点，胜利地提前完成了任务。近一年来，几乎每个司机都经历过象阮文时这样的战斗场面，并且取得了同样的胜利。现在，司机们都满怀豪情壮志地说：“美国飞机只能欺负胆小鬼，有了勇敢就不怕它，就能找出对付它的办法。”
   “照明弹不顶用”
    一天夜晚，阮如云同另外两辆汽车往回赶路，车行到一处很长的开阔地的时候，忽然响起了警报，敌机飞来了。接着，一片闪光，车辆周围亮得耀眼，一切景物看得清清楚楚，敌机扔下来一个又一个照明弹。怎么办？眼看敌机就要绕回来轰炸、扫射了。时间一刻也不能延迟。跑在最前面的阮如云，让助手向后面两辆车打了个招呼，就毅然加快速度飞跑。当敌机绕完了圈子俯冲下来的时候，他们已经越过弹光照明圈。敌机扑了空，便赶到汽车前面连续扔下几个照明弹，企图截住汽车轰炸。心细胆大的阮如云，环顾了一下周围环境，计算了一下车速，迎着照明弹又继续前进。敌机再次俯冲下来，又扑了空。这样，阮如云和他的战友同敌机反复捉迷藏，一直跑完了开阔地，等到汽车隐蔽起来以后，敌机还在头上乱嗡嗡，乱打照明弹。
    阮如云告诉我们说：“起初，有的年青司机见了这个亮家伙，心里确实有些着慌。同它斗过几回以后，大家都说：照明弹不顶用，吓唬不了人！”接着，他风趣地说，现在司机们倒希望在路上能碰上照明弹，因为它可以帮助司机加快速度哩！
    爱车如生命
    在敌机疯狂轰炸的情况下，保证车辆安全，是司机们向祖国作出的庄严誓言。他们的口号是：“爱车如爱生命，惜油如惜血”。
    一次，一个车队小组渡过一条河，其他的车都顺利地过去了，只有一辆车不慎陷在水里。情况是很紧急的：河这边找不到人，无法帮助拉车，而渡河找人当时已无船只。这可急坏了驾驶这辆车的司机。尽管当晚凉风习习，水深流急，这个司机却把衣服一脱，游泳过了河。他把陷车的情况报告了自己的战友。于是，大家一商量，就一齐游过河，把车上物资卸下，用树枝把车辆伪装好。第二天虽然敌机在这里上空不断盘旋，但它无法发现车辆。后来，这辆车在人们的帮助下终于安全地过河了。　　新华社记者　胡本英

    约翰逊想用“恢复轰炸”迫使越南北方人民屈服，美国宣传机器叫嚷要“通过空袭”把越南“打垮”。但是，这种战争讹诈手段，在英雄的越南人民面前是绝对不能得逞的。这里发表的报道越南北方交通运输情况的消息和通讯，提供了一个有力的证明。
    越南北方成千成万的交通运输职工和工兵战士，在美机狂轰滥炸的日子里，把公路当作战场，把汽车当成武器，以大无畏的英雄气概和机智巧妙的办法，克服了无数的困难，保证了运输线的畅通无阻，使前线战士及时地得到了打击美国强盗所需要的各种物资。
    他们所以能够筑成一条打不烂、炸不断的钢铁运输线，是因为他们有着在精神上压倒美帝国主义的钢铁意志。这种伟大的精神力量是美国强盗的飞机和炸弹所根本无法战胜的，也是约翰逊之流所无法理解的。
