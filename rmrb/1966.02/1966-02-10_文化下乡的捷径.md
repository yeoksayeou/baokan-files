　　Culture going to the countryside is a very important aspect, and books are key. However, the countryside is vast and the regions are dispersed. How can we widely and promptly deliver revolutionary books to the hands of the broad masses of peasants? While Xinhua Bookstore should certainly strive to face the countryside and send books there, relying solely on the strength of Xinhua Bookstore is clearly far from enough. Recently, Anhui Province and Changling County in Jilin Province have adopted a method of combining "specialized, part-time, and mass" efforts to popularize the rural book distribution network, which has very well resolved this contradiction. The "specialized, part-time, and mass" combination means taking the professional Xinhua Bookstore as the backbone, the兼营 (concurrently operated) supply and marketing cooperatives as assistants, and relying on the amateur efforts of the masses. The result of doing this is that the rural book distribution network has been greatly expanded.
　　The establishment of the "specialized, part-time, and mass" combination rural book distribution network enables books to quickly go to the countryside, which not only popularizes culture but also facilitates the commune members. The books are delivered to the village entrance and the fields, and the peasants praise, "We can buy food, clothing, and supplies, and now we can also buy things to read. Chairman Mao really thinks of us poor and lower-middle peasants!"
　　Because the distribution network penetrates deeply into the countryside, distribution workers can gain a relatively deep understanding of the needs of the peasants. In this way, the books supplied to the countryside can be "suitable" for them. More importantly, through the popularization and in-depth development of the rural book distribution network, the socialist cultural front in the countryside has been consolidated and expanded. Because revolutionary books and books of scientific knowledge are sent to the countryside more, faster, and more appropriately, the revolutionary books fully play their role in spreading Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and knowledge of class struggle and production struggle in the vast countryside.

    文化下乡的捷径
    海禾
    文化下乡，图书是一个重要的方面。可是农村幅员广阔，地区分散，怎样才能把革命书籍广泛地、及时地送到广大农民的手中呢？新华书店固然要努力面向农村，送书下乡，但光靠新华书店的力量显然是远远不足的。最近，安徽省和吉林省长岭县采取了“专、兼、群”三结合的方法，普及农村图书发行网，就很好地解决了这个矛盾。“专、兼、群”三结合，就是以新华书店专业为骨干，以兼营的供销社为助手，以群众业余力量为依托。这样做的结果，大大扩大了农村的图书发行网。
      “专、兼、群”三结合的农村图书发行网的建立，使图书能迅速下乡，既普及了文化，也方便了社员。书送到了村口，田头，农民们称赞说：“吃的、穿的，用的能买到，如今看的也能买到，毛主席为我们贫下中农想的真周到！”
    由于发行网深入农村，发行工作者就能够比较深入地了解到农民的需要；这样，下乡供应的图书也就能做到“对路”了。重要的是，通过农村图书发行网的普及和深入，巩固和扩大了农村的社会主义文化阵地。由于革命书籍和科学知识书籍下乡下得多、下得快、下得对路，这就充分发挥了革命图书在广大农村中传播马列主义、毛泽东思想，传播阶级斗争和生产斗争知识的作用。提高了农民的社会主义觉悟，推动了农村的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动，丰富了农村的文化生活。
