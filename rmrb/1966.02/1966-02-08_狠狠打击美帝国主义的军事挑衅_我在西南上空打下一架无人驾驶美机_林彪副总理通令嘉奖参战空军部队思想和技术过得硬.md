    Resolutely Strike Down the Military Provocations of U.S. Imperialism
    I Shot Down an Unmanned American Aircraft Over Southwest China
    Vice Premier Lin Biao Issued a Circular of Commendation Praising the Participating Air Force Units for Their Excellent Ideology and Technology

    Xinhua News Agency, 7th. On the afternoon of the 7th, a U.S. imperialist military unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft invaded the airspace of Southwest China to conduct reconnaissance activities and was shot down by the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Lin Biao, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, today issued a commendation order, praising the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for shooting down a U.S. imperialist military unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft over Southwest China.

    The commendation order stated that this battle was accurate and fierce, proving that your ideological style and tactical technology are excellent. This is a victory you have achieved by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continuing to give prominence to politics, and resolutely implementing the Military Commission's policy for the entire army's work in 1966. Your victory is a powerful blow to U.S. imperialism's rampant expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam and its continuous military provocations against us. The commendation order hopes that the air force units participating in this battle will conscientiously sum up their experience, be a hundred times more vigilant, strengthen combat readiness, and be ready to eliminate all enemy aircraft that invade.
