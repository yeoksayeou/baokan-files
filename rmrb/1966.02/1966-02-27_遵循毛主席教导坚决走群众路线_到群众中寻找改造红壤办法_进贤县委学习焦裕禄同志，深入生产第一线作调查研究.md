　　Follow Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely take the mass line
　　Seek methods for transforming red soil from the masses
　　Jinxian County Party Committee learns from Comrade Jiao Yulu, conducts investigations and research by going deep into the front lines of production
　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 26th  After learning from the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, the Jinxian County Party Committee of Jiangxi is working hard to lead ideological revolutionization. They proposed: Go to the most arduous battlefronts to temper revolutionary will, and go to the poorest masses to increase class feelings.
　　Now the County Party Secretary and most of the County Party Committee members have gone to the front lines of production. According to the County Party Committee's decision, they are settling down in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, eating, living, and working with them, and seeking from the masses experiences and methods for controlling mountains, water, and soil, and transforming red soil. County Party Secretary Cai Changqing even took the lead in transferring his base to the most difficult Dayling Brigade of Sanyang Commune in the county. After comparing himself to Jiao Yulu and finding shortcomings, County Party Committee member Hu Jiede resolutely requested to go to a more difficult place for training. With the approval of the County Party Committee, he took his luggage and went to a struggling team to stay and work. He repeatedly expressed to the organization: "I want to thoroughly transform myself in the face of difficulties, and I want to work hard for the people for the rest of my life."
　　Jinxian County is a typical low-yield red soil area in Jiangxi Province. Red soil arable land is acidic, heavy, and compacted, prone to drought and flooding. Red soil mountains are barren and bare, making it difficult for plants to grow. The water surfaces surrounded by red soil hills are gradually silted up by red sand, affecting utilization. Difficult conditions require the county party leaders to shoulder even heavier burdens. In the past, the County Party Committee has also done a lot of work in leading the people of the county to transform red soil. But how can we do it better and faster? The glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu gave them great education and inspiration. In the activity of taking Jiao Yulu as a mirror, comparing thoughts, and finding shortcomings, all members of the County Party Committee and commune party secretaries unanimously realized that to quickly transform the county's natural appearance, the most fundamental thing is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a lively way like Jiao Yulu, transform their subjective world, and achieve complete and thorough service to the people. At the same time, it is necessary to mobilize and rely on the masses, and seek ways to transform red soil from the masses like Jiao Yulu.
　　After learning from Jiao Yulu, the leading cadres of the County Party Committee went to the front lines of production and among the poor and lower-middle peasants to conduct investigations and research in person. Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee Yi Shuilong and Deputy County Head Zhu Xiaoqiu led a group of cadres and technicians to go deep into the barren hills of Beiling and Mashan to conduct on-the-spot surveys, grasp first-hand information, and at the same time visit the masses and summarize the successful experience of local red soil transformation. Based on the collected data, the County Party Committee has decided to establish forest farms in these two places.
　　After the leading cadres of the County Party Committee went deep among the masses, they also discovered that Sanli Commune had good experience in governing red soil cultivated land on steep mountain slopes. In the past, people always thought that the irrigation problem of red soil cultivated land on mountain slopes could not be solved, and the transformation was very difficult. However, Sanli Commune relied on collective strength to draw water up the mountain and turn the slopes into horizontal terraces, solving the irrigation problem of the slopes. At present, the County Party Committee is summarizing and promoting their experience.

　　遵循毛主席教导坚决走群众路线
　　到群众中寻找改造红壤办法
　　进贤县委学习焦裕禄同志，深入生产第一线作调查研究
    新华社南昌二十六日电  中共江西进贤县委学习焦裕禄同志光辉事迹后，正在领导思想革命化方面狠下功夫。他们提出：到最艰苦的斗争前线去锻炼革命意志，到最贫困的群众中去增添阶级感情。
    现在县委书记和大部分县委委员已到生产第一线，并根据县委决定，到贫农下中农家落脚扎根，与贫农下中农同吃同住同劳动，从群众中寻找治山治水治田，改造红壤的经验和办法。县委书记蔡长庆还带头把自己的基点转移到全县中条件最艰苦的三阳公社大岭大队。县委委员胡阶德，对照焦裕禄找了差距以后，坚决地要求到更艰苦的地方去锻炼，经县委批准，他带着行李到了一个困难队蹲点。他再三向组织上表示：“我要到困难中去彻底改造自己，要为人民苦干一辈子。”
    进贤县是江西省典型的红壤低产地区。红壤耕地，酸重板结，易旱易涝；红壤山岭，光秃荒芜，草木难生；受红壤山丘包围的水面，渐渐被红沙淤积，影响利用，艰苦的条件，要求县委领导担起更加重的担子。过去，县委在领导全县人民改造红壤方面也做了不少工作。但是怎样才能搞得更好些、更快些呢？焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹，给了他们以很大的教育和启发。全体县委委员和公社党委书记，在以焦裕禄为镜子，比思想、找差距的活动中，一致认识到，要较快地改造全县自然面貌，最根本的是要象焦裕禄那样，活学活用毛主席的著作，改造自己的主观世界，作到完全、彻底地为人民服务。同时，要象焦裕禄那样，发动群众，依靠群众，从群众中寻找改造红壤的办法。
    学习焦裕禄以后，县委领导干部纷纷到生产第一线去，到贫农下中农当中去，亲自调查研究。县委副书记易水龙、副县长朱啸秋分别带领一批干部和技术员，深入北岭、麻山两个荒岭里，实地勘察，掌握第一手资料，同时访问群众，总结当地改造红壤的成功经验，根据搜集到的资料，县委已决定在这两个地方创办林场。
    县委的领导干部深入群众以后，还发现了三里公社有治理山岭陡坡红壤耕地的良好经验。过去人们总认为山岭陡坡上红壤耕地的灌溉问题无法解决，改造很困难。而三里公社依靠集体力量，把水引上山岭，将坡地整修成水平梯地，解决了坡地的灌溉问题。目前，县委正在总结推广他们的经验。
