　　The "Reason" of Sophistry
　　In Shandong Province, a petroleum supply station had a large oil tank that had been leaking oil for a long time. The soil around the tank was soaked and discolored, but it didn't attract the attention of the station's leaders. Later, comrades from the Shandong Provincial Department of Commerce came to inspect the work and discovered this situation, suggesting they check the oil tank. They didn't take it seriously. It turned out they had a "reason": "Our station has not exceeded the reasonable loss." The comrades from the Provincial Department of Commerce then checked themselves and found that the oil tank was indeed leaking, and after digging several feet deep nearby, there was still a lot of petroleum that had seeped down.
　　In the process of purchasing, selling, transporting, and storing goods, some losses are inevitable, which is called "reasonable loss." The state's regulations on "reasonable loss" indicators were originally measures to prevent waste. However, "the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom." Some people who don't care much about state property have used this indicator as an excuse for waste. They watch as petroleum is unreasonably wasted within the "reasonable loss" indicator and remain indifferent. Is there any semblance of reason in this? The so-called "reason" of this petroleum supply station is just a piece of sophistry from people who don't care about state property.

### 强词夺理之“理”

    强词夺理之“理”
    山东省有个石油供应站，装石油的大油罐长期漏油，油罐周围的土都浸得变了颜色，也没有引起站里领导人员的注意。后来，山东省商业厅的同志到这里来检查工作，发现这一情况，建议他们检查一下油罐。他们还不以为然。原来他们有条“理由”：“我们站没有超过合理损耗。”商业厅的同志便自己动手检查，果然油罐有漏油的地方，在附近地上挖了几尺深，还有不少渗下去的石油。
    商品在购销、运输、储藏的过程中，不可避免地会造成一些损耗，这就叫“合理损耗”。国家规定“合理损耗”的指标，本来是防止浪费的措施。可是，“仁者见仁，智者见智”，有些不大爱护国家财产的人，竟把这个指标作了浪费的借口。他们眼看着石油在“合理损耗”的指标内被不合理的损耗了而无动于衷，这有一丝一毫合理的地方吗？这个石油供应站的所谓“理由”，只是不爱护国家财产的人的一种强词夺理而已。
