    Editor's Note: You are clearly a "villager" like us. This statement from old poor peasant Liu Zongxing was not said casually. It was a fitting assessment of Comrade Jiao Yulu after he and Liu Zongxing sat shoulder to shoulder in the livestock shed for an in-depth conversation. Only a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong could earn such an assessment.

    Comrades working in rural areas should all maintain the true colors of a "villager." What kind of person is a good cadre – a "villager" – in the eyes of the poor and lower-middle peasants? They stand firmly with the poor and lower-middle peasants, consult with the masses on everything, serve the masses wholeheartedly, live frugally, participate in labor, and forever maintain the true colors of the working people. Comrade Jiao Yulu set a good example in all these aspects.

    The more a rural work cadre can maintain the true colors of a "villager," the more he can exert a leadership role. That is to say, the more deeply one goes into the poorest and most miserable poor and lower-middle peasant families, the closer one maintains contact with the poor and lower-middle peasants, the more one can reflect the revolutionary demands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the more firmly one can establish one's revolutionary stance, the more one can understand the true situation in all aspects, and the more one can learn the skills of leading the masses in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation.

    All rural work cadres, especially county committee comrades, to be good students of Comrade Mao Zedong like Comrade Jiao Yulu, should go to the homes of the most struggling poor and lower-middle peasants, to the livestock sheds, completely merge with the masses, and earn the assessment of "villager."

    The radio station is constantly broadcasting the glorious name of "Jiao Yulu." The vast poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao County are immersed in remembrance…

    He Entered the Most Dilapidated and Lowest Thatched Cottage
    A quiet scene pervaded the street of Tushanzhai in Hongmiao Commune. The commune members gathered around the loudspeaker, listening intently to the glorious revolutionary deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu. Strings of tears hung on the faces of the poor peasants; one memory after another churned in the hearts of the class brothers.

    Poor peasant Wang Lianbei of Tushanzhai tightly hugged his youngest son, tears welling up as he said, "Child, no matter how affectionately your father treats you, Secretary Jiao treated you even more affectionately."

    Wang Lianbei recalled the first time he met Comrade Jiao Yulu: It was in the spring of 1963, and Tushanzhai had suffered eight consecutive seasons of crop failures due to disaster. Comrade Jiao Yulu, who had been transferred to Lankao not long before, came to this brigade for the first time. He went from east to west and finally entered the most dilapidated and lowest thatched cottage in the entire team. There was little inside. Wang Lianbei's four or five children huddled together. Seeing this scene, Jiao Yulu said to a cadre who came with him: "Seeing our class brothers living in hardship is like a knife twisting in my heart." He walked up to the children, hugged one of the thinnest tightly, and told Wang Lianbei: "This robber of nature has harmed us badly. As long as we have breath, we must fight it."

    Wang Lianbei stood on the side, feeling sad. At that time, he didn't know that this cadre from the county was Comrade Jiao Yulu; he only knew that this person's warm concern and the heartfelt words he spoke immediately calmed his unsettled mood.

    Wang Lianbei sized up Jiao Yulu. He was dark and thin, and his clothes were very worn. The strangest thing was that he often covered his stomach with one hand, sometimes showing a pained expression. Wang Lianbei concluded that this comrade was ill. He asked him with concern: "Comrade, why are you so thin? I'll cook something for you to eat." Comrade Jiao Yulu laughed heartily and said: "This is how natural disasters have made me thin. When we defeat the old Heaven, I will get fat again."

    Two days later, grain, cloth, money, and a small cart and iron spade were all delivered to Wang Lianbei. This was allocated to him by the county people's committee from the state's relief supplies. Only then did someone tell him that the person who had talked with him was the county party secretary.

    Comrade Jiao Yulu continuously came to Wang Lianbei's home to conduct ideological education on self-reliance. From then on, Wang Lianbei was completely transformed. After the news of Comrade Jiao Yulu's death arrived, Wang Lianbei was extremely saddened. He did not cry or say a word, but only worked hard, digging the river. Many bloody cuts appeared on his hands, and blood flowed down the handle of the shovel. Now, Tushanzhai Brigade has more than enough grain for self-sufficiency, and Wang Lianbei's family eats well and dresses warmly. They stayed by the loudspeaker, listening and thinking. Wang Lianbei said sadly: "Secretary Jiao, you didn't get to see this day before you worked yourself to death for us…"

    In recent days, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Tushanzhai Brigade have all made this determination: to persist in self-reliance in developing production, to commemorate Jiao Yulu in this way.

    Every Word You Said is Etched in My Heart
    In the minds of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao County, Jiao Yulu was not just a good secretary, but first and foremost, he was one of their class brothers. He showed them the way and forged a deeply touching class friendship with them. Xiao Weifen, a livestock keeper from the Lao Hanling Brigade of Chengguan Commune, had talked with Jiao Yulu for three days and three nights. This old poor peasant had once lost his appetite and could not sleep because he missed Comrade Jiao Yulu, and people did not dare to mention the three words "Jiao Yulu" in front of him. At night, after the loudspeaker broadcasting Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds stopped, he leaned on the floor of the livestock room, closed his eyes, and recalled the words they had talked about day and night.

    The first time in the livestock room, Jiao Yulu also sat on the floor and said: "Uncle, taking care of livestock is very hard." Xiao Weifen said: "Before liberation, what kind of hardship haven't I suffered? Compared to that time, this is nothing." Comrade Jiao Yulu said: "To fight against the old Heaven, one must have the spirit of not fearing hardship. But hardship is different. The hardship before liberation was hopeless; the hardship now is bitter first, then sweet, and the days will get better and better." Xiao Weifen looked at Jiao Yulu's attire and listened to what he said, all of which suited his taste, and he liked this newly appointed county party secretary very much. When Comrade Jiao Yulu was leaving, he asked him when he would come again, and he wanted to talk more.

    Two days later, Jiao Yulu came again. This time, he gave Xiao Weifen a big topic, asking him what good methods and ideas he had for changing the face of Lankao. A county party secretary of a county runs to a livestock room to solicit the opinion of a livestock keeper on transforming nature. This kind of trust and importance made Xiao Weifen very uneasy. He said: "Secretary Jiao, this is a big topic, how can I, a rough old man, come up with any ideas." Comrade Jiao Yulu said: "Changing the face of Lankao is everyone's responsibility. You are old and have production experience. I am here to learn from you." Jiao Yulu pointed to the four small and thin animals he was raising and said: "Can this improve production?" He pointed to the barren sand outside the village and said: "Can we completely turn things around relying on this?" With Jiao Yulu's prompting, Xiao Weifen suddenly came up with an idea, he said: "Paulownia trees can be planted in sandy nests to suppress wind, block sand, and have many uses; the development of livestock must be large, this is the lifeblood of our production team; Lankao's sandy soil is best for growing peanuts, and peanut seedlings are also good feed for livestock." Jiao Yulu jumped up with joy and praised: "Good! Good! Good! This is a good idea, it is the three treasures for changing the face of Lankao."

    Xiao Weifen's suggestion was later promoted throughout the county. Comrade Jiao Yulu's leadership style of coming from the masses and going to the masses moved the old man so much that he didn't know what to do, and felt that he was full of inexhaustible energy. Once, he warmly said to Jiao Yulu: "Secretary Jiao, what I'm thinking, you prompt me to say it, and after I say it, you act on it; the words you say to me are also etched in my heart. Your heart is close to me, my heart is close to you, we two have the same mind."

    When Comrade Jiao Yulu was seriously ill and entered the hospital, he cried several times. When the news of his death came, others dared not tell him. After he found out, it was like suffering a disease. His family comforted him: What should a person in their sixties and seventies do being so distraught? They told him to relax. Afterwards, he concentrated all his thoughts on one point: "Taking good care of livestock," this was what Comrade Jiao Yulu had repeatedly instructed him to do before his death. He stayed in the livestock room day and night. His wife brought him dinner every night. He would save one of two steamed buns, and half of one if only one was given, to feed the young livestock at night. He felt that only in this way could he be worthy of Comrade Jiao Yulu.

    Now, when he recalls Jiao Yulu, he says with deep affection: "If Secretary Jiao were alive, how happy he would be! He loved trees, and the thousands of paulownia trees on the edge of our village have all grown up. The number of livestock has increased from four to fourteen. Last year, Lankao had a good year. My family now has a fold of sorghum and a fold of dried sweet potatoes. In the past, Secretary Jiao and I drank wild vegetable soup together. Now, I make good noodles, who can I bring them to?..."

    Clearly a Villager Just Like Us
    Old poor peasant Liu Zongxing of Zhaoduolou Brigade, Zhangjunmu Commune, said: "The first time I saw Comrade Jiao Yulu, he took my hand, and the two of us sat shoulder to shoulder on the floor of the livestock room. I saw that he was wearing a mottled blue cloth jacket, and the vest inside was as tattered as if chickens had pecked at it. I compared my feet with his. He wasn't wearing socks, and his shoes were about the same as mine. I thought to myself: Secretary Jiao! Secretary Jiao, you don't look like a county party secretary at all, you are clearly a villager just like us."

    Villagers understand villagers, and they quickly talked about everything.

    This was the most difficult spring of 1963 in Lankao County. Jiao Yulu discovered that the seven animals raised by Liu Zongxing were fat and shiny. He was very surprised and asked Liu Zongxing to introduce his experience in raising livestock. Liu Zongxing said: "Villagers don't know what experience is, they just work hard in a down-to-earth way. When the harvest is bad, some people abandon their livestock and don't feed them. If you don't want the collective's animals, I want them; all seven animals are raised in my house. I touched the animals that don't understand words and said, as long as I don't die, you won't die. My eight family members all worry about these seven animals, pulling grass to feed the livestock. My third son is a cripple, I made him lie on the ground to dig up grass roots. In one spring, my eight family members dug up more than 10,000 jin of grass. When the wheat was about to head, the grass was eaten up, what to do? I cut the green wheat from one mu of my private plot for the animals to eat. Although people suffered, the animals kept their condition."

    Jiao Yulu listened to Liu Zongxing's narration with tears in his eyes. He said: "You have introduced the most important experience in raising livestock. This is a most valuable treasure, and I want to take you to make reports all over the county."

    This was the first poor peasant hero that Jiao Yulu recommended to the whole county after arriving in Lankao.

    The poor and lower-middle peasants of Zhaoduolou said: "Secretary Jiao has real insight." Some said: "Liu Zongxing is practical and sincere to the collective, he has no false feelings, and Secretary Jiao wholeheartedly serves us, he spotted Liu Zongxing at a glance." Liu Zongxing thought even deeper: "Secretary Jiao is my class brother. Talking with him is like sitting on a cotton bale, comfortable and warm."

    This Bridge is Secretary Jiao's Monument
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was seriously ill and hospitalized. The people of the whole county were anxiously hoping for his condition to improve. Many poor and lower-middle peasants came to the county party committee, asking to visit him in the hospital. In order to let Comrade Jiao Yulu concentrate on treatment, the county party committee repeatedly dissuaded them and did not tell them the real address. When they went back, some people cried all the way.

    Soon, the news of Comrade Jiao Yulu's death came. The vast poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao County were very grieved. They will never forget Comrade Jiao Yulu. They see the sand dunes that have been tamed and think of him; they see the forests that have been formed and think of him; they see the rivers that have been tamed and think of him; even holding the iron shovel for digging rivers and controlling floods makes them think of him. They want to erect a monument to Comrade Jiao Yulu.

    When the commune members of Tushanzhai of Hongmiao Commune were brewing to erect a monument to Comrade Jiao Yulu, Wang Lianbei and the poor and lower-middle peasants came to the bridge in front of the village and stopped. They were silent in recollection with tears in their eyes…. For many years, they had to wade across the river to go to work outside the village. That winter, Comrade Jiao Yulu saw a commune member with sores on his legs wading across the river, felt very sad, and immediately took the initiative to help Tushanzhai build this bridge across the river. Thinking of this, Wang Lianbei said:

    "This bridge is Secretary Jiao's monument."

    This "monument" is engraved with "inscriptions," and these "inscriptions" are the touching class friendship between Comrade Jiao Yulu and the vast poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao. This "inscription" is like an endless stream of warmth, warming the hearts of the vast poor and lower-middle peasants and inspiring them to move forward!

    The commune members of Tushanzhai Brigade, Hongmiao Commune, Lankao County, think of Comrade Jiao Yulu and the fighting days when they planted trees and made forests together to conquer the "three evils" whenever they see the young forest growing vigorously on this sand dune. Cao Yuying, director of the brigade women's federation, and others pointed to the forest belt here and said: "Secretary Jiao led us to control this sand dune."

### 他是俺的阶级兄弟——兰考县贫农下中农心目中的焦裕禄

    他是俺的阶级兄弟
    ——兰考县贫农下中农心目中的焦裕禄
    编者按：你明明是象咱一样的“庄户人”，老贫农刘宗行这句话，绝不是随口说的，而是同焦裕禄同志肩挨肩坐在牲口屋里深谈以后，对焦裕禄同志作的一个恰如其分的鉴定。只有毛泽东同志的好学生，才能取得这样的鉴定。
    在农村工作的同志，都应该保持“庄户人”的本色。贫下中农眼中的好干部——“庄户人”是什么样的呢？他们紧紧地同贫下中农站在一起，凡事同群众商量，全心全意为群众办事，艰苦朴素，参加劳动，永远保持劳动人民的本色。在这许多方面，焦裕禄同志都树立了好榜样。
    一个农村工作干部，越能保持“庄户人”的本色，就越能发挥领导的作用。这就是说，越是深入到最穷最苦的贫下中农当中，同贫下中农保持最紧密的联系，越能反映贫下中农的革命要求，坚定自己的革命立场，越能了解各方面的真实情况，学会领导群众进行阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的本领。
    一切农村工作干部，特别是县委同志们，要象焦裕禄同志那样作毛泽东同志的好学生，就应该象他那样到最困难的贫下中农家里，到饲养棚中，完全同群众打成一片，取得“庄户人”的鉴定。
    广播电台在不断播送着“焦裕禄”这个光辉的名字。兰考县广大贫农下中农，沉浸在怀念之中……
    他走进最破最低的茅屋中
    红庙公社土山寨的街上一片沉静。社员们围聚在喇叭筒下，静听着焦裕禄同志那光辉的革命事迹。一串串泪珠，挂在贫农的脸上；一件件往事，在阶级兄弟的心中翻腾。
    土山寨的贫农王连备紧抱着怀中的小儿子，噙着泪说：“孩子，别看你爹待你亲，待你更亲的还是焦书记。”
    王连备想起了第一次见焦裕禄同志的情形：那是一九六三年春天，土山寨因灾连续八季没有收成。调到兰考不久的焦裕禄同志，第一次到这个大队来，他从东头转到西头，最后走进了全队最破最低的一间茅草屋中。屋里没有什么东西，王连备的四五个孩子围在一起，焦裕禄看到这个光景，对同来的一个干部说：“看到自己的阶级弟兄生活困苦，心象刀剜。”他走到孩子们面前，紧紧搂着其中一个最瘦的，并告诉王连备：“大自然这个强盗，把咱们害苦了，咱们只要有口气，都得跟它拼。”
    王连备站在一边难过。那时，他并不知道这个从县里来的干部是焦裕禄同志；他只知道这个人的问寒问暖，这个人说的那些贴心话，使他那无着落的心情，立即安定了。
    王连备上下打量焦裕禄，他又黑又瘦，衣服很破旧。最奇怪的是他老用一只手捂住肚子，有时现出痛苦的表情。王连备断定这位同志有病。他关心地问他：“同志，你咋这么瘦？我做点饭给你吃。”焦裕禄同志开心地大笑说：“这是被自然灾害弄瘦的，啥时候斗住老天爷，我就会胖起来。”
    两天后，粮、布、钱，还有架小车和铁锨，都给王连备送来了。这是县人民委员会从国家的救济物资中发给他的。这时才有人告诉他，同他谈心的人，是县委书记。
    焦裕禄同志以后不断来王连备家里，向他进行自力更生的思想教育。打这以后，王连备完全变成另外一个人。焦裕禄同志的死讯传来后，王连备难过已极，他不哭也不吭，只是狠狠地劳动、挖河，两手崩了许多血口子，血顺着锨把子往下流。如今，土山寨大队粮食自给有余，王连备一家吃得饱，穿得暖。他们守在喇叭旁边，听着、想着，王连备悲痛地说：“焦书记，你没有来得及看到这一天，就为俺们累死了……”
    几天来，土山寨大队的贫农下中农们，都下了这样的决心：坚持自力更生发展生产，用这个来纪念焦裕禄。
    你说的话句句烙在我心上
    焦裕禄在兰考县的贫农下中农心目中，不光是一个好书记，首先他是他们中的阶级弟兄。他给他们指路，和他们结成感人肺腑的阶级友情。城关公社老韩陵大队的饲养员萧位芬，同焦裕禄谈过三天三夜。这个老贫农因为思念焦裕禄同志，曾一度茶饭不思，人们也不敢在他面前提“焦裕禄”三个字。晚上，当广播焦裕禄同志事迹的喇叭声停止以后，他靠在饲养室里的地铺上，闭上眼，又想起了他们日日夜夜谈过的话。
    第一次在饲养室里，焦裕禄也坐在地铺上，他说：“大爷，喂牲口很辛苦。”萧位芬说：解放前，我啥苦没吃过？比起那时光，这不算苦。”焦裕禄同志说：“和老天爷斗，要有不怕苦的精神。只是苦和苦不同，解放前苦，苦的没指望；如今苦，是先苦后甜，日子越过越好。”萧位芬看看焦裕禄的这身装束，听听他讲的话，都很合自己的脾味，他很喜欢这个新上任的县委书记。焦裕禄同志临走时，他问他啥时候再来，他还想谈。
    两天后，焦裕禄又来了。这回，他给萧位芬出个大题目，问他改变兰考面貌有啥好办法好主意。一个县的县委书记，跑到饲养房里，征求一个饲养员对改造大自然的意见，这种信任和器重，使萧位芬很不安。他说：“焦书记，这大的题，我个大老粗，能拿个啥主意。”焦裕禄同志说：“改变兰考面貌，人人都有份，你年纪大，有生产经验，我是来向你老人家学习的。”焦裕禄指指他喂养的四头瘦小的牲口说：“这能搞好生产吗？”又指指村外一片片荒沙地说：“靠这能彻底翻身吗？”焦裕禄这么一点，萧位芬一下子想出了主意，他说：“沙土窝能种泡桐树，压风，挡沙，用场多；牲口要大发展，这是咱生产队的命根子；兰考的沙土最养花生，花生秧又是牲口的好饲料。”焦裕禄高兴得跳起来称赞道：“好！好！好！这是个好主意，是改变兰考面貌的三大宝。”
    萧位芬的建议，后来在全县推行了。焦裕禄同志这种从群众中来到群众中去的领导作风，感动得这位老人不知咋办好，觉得浑身都是使不完的劲。有一次，他心里热乎乎地向焦裕禄说：“焦书记，我想的，你引我说出来，说出来，你去动；你给我说的话，又句句烙在我心上。你的心贴着我，我的心贴着你，咱俩可是一个心思。”
    焦裕禄同志病重进医院时，他哭过好几次。死讯传来，别的人不敢给他说。以后他知道了，象害了一场病。家里人劝慰他：六七十岁的人，这样悠悠忽忽，咋办？叫他放宽心。以后，他把全部心思凝结在一点上：“喂好牲口”，这是焦裕禄同志生前一再叮嘱过他的话。他日夜守候在饲养室里，老伴每天晚上送来夜饭，送两个馍他留一个，送一个他留一半，夜间给小牲口吃。他觉得只有这样才能对得起焦裕禄同志。
    现在，他回忆起焦裕禄，满怀深情地说：“焦书记要是活着，该多喜欢！他爱树，俺村边的几千棵泡桐树都长大了，牲口由四头发展到十四头，去年兰考是个好年成，俺家现在还有一折子高粱，一折子红芋干，过去，焦书记跟我喝过野菜汤，如今，俺做好面条，去端给谁？……”明明是象咱一样的庄户人
    张君墓公社赵垛楼大队的老贫农刘宗行说：“我第一次看到焦裕禄同志，他拉着我的手，俺俩肩挨肩坐到牲口屋的地铺上。我看他穿着花花打打的蓝布褂子，里头的背心，烂的象鸡叨过一样，我把脚和他的并在一起比比，他没有穿袜子，鞋子和我的差不多。我心想：焦书记呀！焦书记，你那里象个县委书记，明明是象咱一样的庄户人。”
    庄户人了解庄户人，他们很快无所不谈。
    这正是兰考县最困难的一九六三年春。焦裕禄发现刘宗行饲养的七头牲口，又肥又亮。他很奇怪，要刘宗行介绍喂牲口的经验，刘宗行说：“庄户人不知道啥叫经验，只是实打实的干。年成坏，有人把牲口丢下不喂了。你不要集体，我要；七头牲口都喂在我家。我摸着不懂话的牲口说，只要我不死，你就死不了。一家八口人，都为这七头牲口操心，拔草喂牲口。俺的小三是个瘸子，我让他趴在地里剜草根。一春俺八口人刨了一万多斤草。麦子快出穗的时候，草吃光了，咋办？我把一亩自留地的青麦子割下叫牲口吃了。人虽受了屈，牲口保住了膘。”
    焦裕禄含着泪听完刘宗行的叙述，他说：“喂牲口的最重要的经验，你都介绍出来了，这是个最宝贵的财宝，我要带你到全县各地去作报告。”
    这是焦裕禄到兰考后，向全县推荐的第一个贫农英雄。
    赵垛楼的贫下中农说：“焦书记的眼力真。”有的说：“刘宗行对集体实打实，没虚情，焦书记一心一意为着咱，他一眼就看中刘宗行。”刘宗行想的更深：“焦书记是俺的阶级兄弟。我和他谈话，象坐在棉花包上，又舒坦又暖和。”这桥就是焦书记的纪念碑
    焦裕禄同志病重住医院了。全县人民，都在焦虑地盼望他的病情好转。很多贫农下中农都来县委，要求到医院去看望他。县委为了让焦裕禄同志安心治病，多次劝阻他们，也不把真实地址告诉他们。他们回去时，有些人，一路上都在哭。
    不久，焦裕禄同志逝世的讯息传来了。兰考县的广大贫农下中农，十分悲痛。他们永远忘不了焦裕禄同志。他们看到那被治服的沙丘想起他；看见那成林的树木想起他；看见那驯服的河道想起他；就是拿着挖河治水的铁锨也想起他。他们要为焦裕禄同志立纪念碑。
    红庙公社土山寨的社员酝酿给焦裕禄同志立碑的时候，王连备和贫下中农们不约而同地来到村前的桥头，停住了脚步。他们含着泪，沉默在回忆之中……。多少年来，他们出村劳动，都要淌水过河。那年冬天，焦裕禄同志在这里看见一个腿上生了疮的社员淌过河去，十分难过，立即亲自动手帮助土山寨建立了这座跨河桥。想到这里，王连备说：
    “这桥就是焦书记的纪念碑。”
    这“碑”上是刻有“碑文”的，这“碑文”就是焦裕禄同志和兰考广大贫下中农之间的感人肺腑的阶级友情。这“碑文”象一条源源无尽的暖流，温暖着广大贫下中农的心，鼓舞着他们前进！

    兰考县红庙公社土山寨大队的社员，一看到这沙丘上茁壮成长的幼林，就想起了焦裕禄同志和他们共同植树造林、征服“三害”的战斗日子。大队妇女主任曹玉英等人指着这里的林带说：“焦书记领着我们把这沙丘给治住了。”
