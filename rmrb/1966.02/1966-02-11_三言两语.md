    Three Words and Two Phrases

    Relatively Speaking
    U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara praised the "brave spirit" of the South Vietnamese puppet army, saying "they fought very well."
    It's really hard to know where to begin. Isn't it precisely because the South Vietnamese puppet army suffered a complete defeat that the American invading army had to go into battle bare-chested?
    However, when it comes to fighting, the South Vietnamese puppet army is indeed considered "outstanding" compared to those young American masters.

    Exposing Himself
    Nguyen Van Thieu, the head of the South Vietnamese puppet, spoke to reporters about his views on the Geneva Accords, saying pretentiously, "South Vietnam did not sign these agreements."
    What he said is absolutely correct. The South Vietnamese puppet did not sign the Geneva Accords. But what is the reason for this? It is very clear to people that the South Vietnamese puppet regime was created by the United States' destruction of the Geneva Accords. This Saigon puppet leader did not expect that the sentence he thought was clever actually exposed his own background.

    三言两语
    相对而言
    美国国防部长麦克纳马拉夸赞南越伪军表现的“勇敢精神”，说什么“他们仗打得很出色”。
    这真是不知从何说起。不正是由于南越伪军一败涂地，所以美国侵略军才不得不赤膊上阵的吗？
    不过，南越伪军打起仗来，比那些美国少爷兵倒的确还是算得上“出色”的。
    自己露底
    南越傀儡的头子阮文绍对记者谈到他对日内瓦协议的看法，神气活现地说：“南越没有在这些协议上签字。”
    话倒说得一点不差。在日内瓦协议上的确没有南越傀儡的签字。但是，这是什么原因呢？人们都很清楚，南越傀儡政权乃是美国破坏了日内瓦协议制造出来的。这个西贡傀儡头子没想到他自以为得意的这句话实际上正是抖出了自己的老底。
