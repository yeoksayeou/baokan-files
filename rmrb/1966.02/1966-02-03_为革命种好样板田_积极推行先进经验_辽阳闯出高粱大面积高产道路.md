    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 2nd (reporter) – Can sorghum achieve high yields over large areas? The sorghum model fields cultivated in Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province in 1965 tell people with facts that as long as politics are emphasized, the enthusiasm of the masses for farming for the revolution is mobilized, and scientific farming is implemented, sorghum can achieve high yields over large areas.
    The sorghum model fields in Liaoyang County totaled 107,560 mu. These fields belong to the four adjacent communes of Xiaotun, Lanji, Shoushan, and Anping, and the Shoushan Farm. Last year, the climatic conditions here were not considered good. However, due to the masses' strong drive to farm for the revolution, the advanced experiences of labor models and existing scientific achievements were promoted in accordance with local conditions. The average yield per mu of the entire sorghum model field reached more than 400 jin. Among the model fields, the 24,200 mu of sorghum in Xiaotun Commune averaged 545 jin per mu, of which two brigades reached 800 jin and 900 jin per mu respectively.
    1965 was the second year that Liaoyang County established sorghum model fields. The purpose of establishing model fields is mainly to pioneer a path to large-area high yields for sorghum, the local main food crop. However, when it was decided to continue establishing sorghum model fields here at the beginning of the year, ideological obstacles were encountered. Because the sorghum yield increased in the previous year's model fields, some people developed the idea that "production has reached its peak," believing that "all measures have been exhausted and potential has been fully tapped." No matter how much effort is put in, the sorghum yield will not be higher. Some people also felt that it was not worth the effort to run the model fields, and that even if the yield was higher, it would not be as profitable as planting cantaloupe and watermelon.
    The leadership of the model fields analyzed this ideological situation, believing that these problems were ultimately due to a lack of the idea of farming for the revolution and a spirit of continuous revolution. Therefore, they focused on ideological and political work. They led the cadres and commune members of each commune and brigade to study Chairman Mao's works, such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," and combined it with discussions on questions such as "For whom are we farming?" and "Why are we running model fields?" As a result, the revolutionary spirit of the vast number of cadres and the masses was greatly boosted. Each commune and brigade within the scope of the model fields took pride in being able to contribute to the exploration of high-yield sorghum paths, and competed with each other in terms of ideology, looking for gaps, and launching a vigorous and solid competition to learn from, catch up with, help, and surpass each other. Many brigades and production teams, in order to ensure high yields in the model fields, relied on their own efforts to vigorously grasp farmland capital construction. The production teams of Lanjia Commune treated more than 10,000 meters of rivers, freeing more than 1,500 mu of land from water damage. Three brigades, including Xiangyangsi, of Shoushan Commune, built drainage projects in low-lying areas, creating conditions for high yields in the model fields.
    On the basis of the improved awareness of the vast number of cadres and commune members in farming for the revolution and running model fields for the revolution, the leadership of the model fields mobilized the masses to adopt improved varieties in accordance with local conditions, promote the advanced experiences of Xu Baoyan, a special-grade agricultural labor model in Liaoning Province and captain of the Gaochengzi Brigade of Xiaotun Commune, and existing scientific research results, and implement scientific farming. Xu Baoyan's experience is first and foremost to ensure that all seedlings are strong, laying the foundation for ensuring the number of plants and the entire growth and development of sorghum. In the process of sorghum growth and development, corresponding measures are taken based on weather, land, and seedlings to control or promote sorghum growth. For example, after sorghum jointing and before heading, it is the peak period of vegetative growth, requiring a large amount of water and fertilizer. However, if it is allowed to grow freely, it will inevitably grow into a "silly big fellow who only eats but does not work." At this time, multiple hoeings are implemented to cut off some of the sorghum's root system to control its growth. After sorghum heading, the main thing is reproductive growth, which is the key to determining the number and weight of grains. At this time, topdressing of heading fertilizer is heavily applied to achieve large panicles and many grains. The promotion of Xu Baoyan's experience and other scientific achievements in the model fields not only ensured high yields, but also drove mass scientific experimentation activities, and strengthened the technical forces of the communes and brigades. Since the establishment of the model fields, a scientific and technological promotion network centered on the model fields, combining leaders, technicians, and the masses, has been formed here.
    In summarizing the achievements of the sorghum model fields, relevant departments of Liaoyang County believe that there are still some problems in the work of the model fields in 1965. For example, the organized promotion of the model fields' experience is insufficient, some model fields lack necessary farmland capital construction, and the yields of the communes and brigades planting model fields vary widely. At present, they are organizing commune members to solve these problems in order to promote the comprehensive stable and high yield of sorghum in 1966.

### 为革命种好样板田　积极推行先进经验  辽阳闯出高粱大面积高产道路

    为革命种好样板田　积极推行先进经验
    辽阳闯出高粱大面积高产道路
    新华社沈阳二日电　高粱能不能大面积高产？辽宁省辽阳县一九六五年办的高粱样板田用事实告诉人们：只要突出政治，调动群众为革命种田的积极性，并且实行科学种田，高粱完全可以大面积高产。
    辽阳县的高粱样板田共有十万七千五百六十亩。这些田分属于相连的小屯、兰家、首山、安平四个公社和首山农场。去年，这里的气候条件并不算好，但是，由于群众为革命种田的干劲足，因地制宜地推行了劳动模范的先进经验和已有的科学成果，整个高粱样板田的平均亩产量达到四百斤以上。样板田内小屯公社的二万四千二百多亩高粱，平均亩产五百四十五斤，其中，有两个大队亩产分别达到八百斤和九百斤。
    一九六五年，是辽阳县办高粱样板田的第二年。办样板田的目的，主要是为当地的主要粮食作物高粱闯出一条大面积高产的途径来。但是，年初确定在这里继续办高粱样板田时，却遇到了思想障碍。由于上一年办样板，高粱产量有了上升，一部分人产生了“生产到顶”的思想，认为“措施用绝了，潜力挖光了”，再搞，高粱的产量也不会再高。有些人还觉得花力气办样板没便宜，产量再高，也不如多种香瓜、西瓜来钱多。
    样板田的领导机构，分析了这种思想状况，认为存在这些问题，归根到底是缺乏为革命种田的思想和不断革命的精神。于是，狠抓思想政治工作。他们领导各社、队的干部、社员，学习毛主席的著作《纪念白求恩》和《为人民服务》等文章，结合讨论“为谁种地？”、“为什么搞样板？”等问题。这样一来，广大干部、群众的革命精神大振，样板田范围内的各社、队都以能为探索高粱高产道路出力为荣，互相之间比思想、找差距，展开了轰轰烈烈扎扎实实的比学赶帮超竞赛运动。不少大队、生产队为了保证样板田高产，自力更生狠抓农田基本建设。兰家公社各生产队治河一万多米，使一千五百多亩地免除了水害。首山公社向阳寺等三个大队，在洼地上兴修了排水工程，为样板田高产创造了条件。
    在广大干部和社员为革命种田、为革命办样板的觉悟有了提高的基础上，样板田的领导机构，又发动群众，因地制宜的采用良种，推广辽宁省特等农业劳动模范、小屯公社高城子大队队长徐宝岩等人的先进经验和已有的科学研究成果，实行科学种田。徐宝岩的经验，首先是要力保苗全苗壮，为保证株数和高粱的整个生长发育奠定基础。在高粱生长、发育过程中，又看天看地看苗，采取相应的措施，控制或促进高粱生长。象高粱拔节后到抽穗前，正是营养生长盛期，需要大量水、肥，但如果任其生长，必将长成个“光吃饭不干活的傻大个”，这时，就实行多铲多趟切断高粱部分根系，来控制它的生长。高粱出穗以后，主要是生殖生长，是决定粒数粒重的关键，这时，就重施攻穗肥，来实现穗大粒多。象徐宝岩的这套经验和其他科学成果在样板田上的推广，不仅保证了高产，还带动了群众性的科学试验活动，壮大了社、队的技术力量。从办样板田以来，这里以样板田为中心的领导、技术员、群众三结合的科学技术推广网已经形成。
    辽阳县有关部门在总结高粱样板田的成就时认为，一九六五年在样板田工作中，还存在一些问题。如：有组织地推广样板田的经验不够，有些样板田缺乏必要的农田基本建设，种样板田的社队之间产量相差悬殊，等等。目前，他们正在组织社员们着手解决这些问题，以便促进一九六六年高粱全面稳产高产。
