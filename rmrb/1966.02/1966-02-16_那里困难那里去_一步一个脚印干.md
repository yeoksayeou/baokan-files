    These past few days, with tears welling in our eyes, we have read the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu again and again. The more we read, the more moved we are, and the more we feel our blood boiling.

    Comparing ourselves, we find a great gap in both ideological and work style. Our Maqiao Commune in Shanghai County is located in the middle reaches of the Huangpu River, with flat terrain. We have neither major floods nor sandstorms, and certainly no saline-alkali land. The conditions are much better than those in Lankao. However, our production level has not yet reached the expectations of the Party and the people. For example, the so-called biggest problem in the Maqiao area is the high groundwater level, which affects production. This problem is nothing compared to the "three scourges" of Lankao, but we have not solved it well for a long time, and it has become a "long-standing, big, and difficult" problem. What is the reason? After studying the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, the answer found is: "Without revolutionary ideology, there is no revolutionary action." In our thinking, there are the two words "laziness" and "complacency," which are incompatible with revolutionization. Because of "laziness," we are unwilling to do arduous and in-depth and meticulous investigation and research work. Because of being satisfied with the status quo, we lack the action of continuous revolution. Therefore, although we have also dug some ditches and taken some measures in recent years, we have never conducted systematic and in-depth investigation and research on the water conditions, land conditions, and crop conditions of the entire commune. When meetings are held, we can only rely on "approximate" arrangements for work, and we cannot be as clear in direction, determined, and correct in measures as Comrade Jiao Yulu was on many issues.

    The day before yesterday, when we were studying the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, it was the time when the entire commune was conducting a major production inspection. All members of our Party committee and commune cadres changed their work style and, for the first time, abandoned their bicycles and walked all over the commune, changing the previous method of riding bicycles and taking a cursory look. We spent two full days conducting investigation and research. Although this is far from being comparable to Comrade Jiao Yulu's work style, we have learned about many situations that we usually cannot see or hear. After returning, we repeatedly studied the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu in the evening. Although it was late at night, everyone's mood was very enthusiastic. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would learn and apply Chairman Mao's works creatively like Comrade Jiao Yulu, thoroughly change their work style, go deep down, not only be with the poor and lower-middle peasants in form by eating, living, and working together, but also share the same fate and breathe the same air with the poor and lower-middle peasants in thought and class feelings. We will go wherever there are difficulties, work hard and practically step by step, establish a thorough proletarian world outlook of serving the people, fight in the countryside for a lifetime, and dedicate our life's energy to the cause of building a new socialist countryside!

    那里困难那里去　一步一个脚印干
    上海县马桥公社党委副书记　朱凤章
    这几天我们含着满眶热泪，一遍又一遍地读着焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹，越读越激动，越读越感到热血奔腾。
    对照自己，发现无论是思想作风或工作作风方面，差距都很大。我们马桥公社地处黄浦江的中游，地势平坦，既没有大的水涝和风沙，更没有盐碱地，条件比兰考不知好多少倍，但我们的生产水平，还没有达到党和人民对我们的期望。如摆在我们马桥地区的所谓最大问题是地下水位较高，影响了生产，这一问题比起兰考“三害”，根本算不了什么问题，但我们长期以来没有很好解决，成为“老、大、难”的问题。是什么原因呢？通过学习焦裕禄同志的事迹后，找到的答案是：“没有革命化的思想就没有革命化的行动”。在我们思想上存在着与革命化格格不入的“懒”与“满”两个字。由于“懒”，就不愿做艰苦的、深入细致的调查研究工作；由于满足于现状，就缺乏不断革命的行动，因此虽然近年来我们也开了一些沟，采取了一些措施，但从未对全社的水情、地情、物情（农作物情况）作过系统深入的调查研究，开起会来只能凭“大概”布置工作，不能象焦裕禄同志那样对许多问题都做到方向明、决心大、措施对。
    前天，我们学习焦裕禄同志的事迹时，正值全公社进行生产大检查，我们全体党委成员和公社干部改变作风，第一次丢下自行车，徒步跑遍全社，改变了以往骑自行车走马看花的方法，跑了两个整天，进行调查研究。虽然这与焦裕禄同志的工作作风还远远不能比较，但却了解到不少平时看不见、听不到的情况。回来后，晚上又反复学习了焦裕禄同志的事迹，虽然已经深夜，但大家的情绪非常热烈，一致表示：要象焦裕禄同志那样活学活用毛主席著作，彻底改变作风，深入下去，不仅在形式上做到与贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动，而且一定要从思想上、阶级感情上与贫下中农同命运、共呼吸，那里有困难就到那里去，脚踏实地、一步一个脚印地苦干实干，树立彻底为人民的无产阶级世界观，在农村战斗一辈子，把毕生精力献给建设社会主义新农村的事业！
