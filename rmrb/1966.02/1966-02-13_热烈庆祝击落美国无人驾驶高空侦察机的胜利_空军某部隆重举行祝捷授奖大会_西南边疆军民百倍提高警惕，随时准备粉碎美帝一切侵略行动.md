    Xinhua News Agency, February 12th – An air force unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a grand victory celebration and award ceremony today in a certain area of ​​Southwest China, warmly celebrating the major victory of shooting down a U.S. imperialist military unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft on February 7th, and rewarding the combat meritorious units and personnel.
    Xu Shenji, Deputy Commander of the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and local military and government leaders Cha Yusheng, Liu Piyun, and Liu Maogong attended the meeting.
    When the air force soldiers who shot down the enemy plane entered the venue in formation, thunderous applause rang out throughout the audience for a long time.
    At the beginning of the conference, Xu Shenji, Deputy Commander of the Air Force, read the commendation order issued by Lin Biao, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, to the combat meritorious units; Liu Maogong, the person in charge of the local air force unit, read the list of units and commanders and fighters who received awards for their meritorious service in this operation. Amidst warm applause, Xu Shenji and Cha Yusheng, the person in charge of the Southwest region troops, presented certificates of merit to representatives of meritorious units and commanders and fighters.
    In his speech, Xu Shenji pointed out that this battle was well fought, accurately fought, and fiercely fought, fully demonstrating the revolutionary heroism of our army, which is invincible. It once again vividly proved that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat power.
    Xu Shenji strongly condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism in rampantly expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam and constantly carrying out military provocations against us. He encouraged the commanders and fighters of the Air Force to overcome arrogance and rashness, be modest and prudent, increase vigilance a hundredfold, give prominence to politics, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and earnestly learn from Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Jiao Yulu, placing the foothold of all work on the word "fight", and be ready to eliminate any enemy who dares to invade at any time.
    Liu Piyun, the person in charge of the local government, said in his speech that the people of all ethnic groups in the local area should learn from the experience of the participating troops in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and highlighting politics, accelerate socialist revolution and socialist construction, do a good job in the "three implementations" of militia work, and resolutely work with the People's Liberation Army to build an impregnable wall on the southwest border.
    Feng Quanmin, the representative of the participating troops, said in his speech that it is necessary to continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, bear in mind Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty helps one to progress, while arrogance makes one lag behind," continue to give prominence to politics, and do a solid job in all aspects of combat readiness, ready to engage in combat at any time, and strive for greater victories for the motherland and the people.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 12th – The broad masses of military personnel and civilians in the southwest border region of our country have held various gatherings in recent days to warmly celebrate the victory of our air force units in shooting down a U.S. imperialist military unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft in the airspace of the southwest region on February 7th, and to angrily condemn U.S. imperialism for further expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam and stepping up military provocations against us. The border military and civilians, with high fighting spirit, resolutely expressed that they will learn from the combat spirit of the air force units that shot down the enemy plane, be vigilant a hundredfold, and be ready at any time to completely smash all new aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism.
    As soon as the news of our air force units shooting down the invading American plane reached the southwest border region of the motherland, people of all ethnic groups were overjoyed and spread the news. They cheered repeatedly: "It was a great pleasure to fight! It was a good fight!" Many people who witnessed the American bandit plane being beaten up surrounded the wreckage of the plane and shouted, "Down with U.S. imperialism!" Angrily condemning the military provocations of the American bandits. Many border defense soldiers, workers, peasants, and students also held forums to denounce the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism. Ding Liying, a five-good soldier of a certain unit stationed on the border, said at the forum: "The Air Force Big Brothers shot down a U.S. military unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, which is a powerful blow to U.S. imperialism's rampant expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam and continuous military provocations against us. It was a decisive and beautiful fight, and it was really gratifying. We must deal with the aggressors without mercy." Guo Miaomiao, a cadre of a certain agency whose hometown is connected to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by mountains and rivers, said: "I once drank water from the same river with the Vietnamese people and walked on the same street. The bombs of the American bandits bombed Vietnamese soil, just like bombing my heart. U.S. imperialism has recently carried out indiscriminate bombing in Vietnam and sent bandit planes to our airspace for reconnaissance. This shows that the 'peace talks' chanted by U.S. imperialism are completely a big conspiracy and a big fraud, which will never be able to deceive the Vietnamese people and the people of the world." Shen Liurong, an old worker at the Kunming Machine Tool Factory who was bitten by a U.S. invasion army's wolf dog before liberation, participated in a rally denouncing the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism early in the morning of the 8th after finishing his night shift. He said that the American jackals will never change their biting nature. We must be vigilant, step up production, and be ready to support the People's Liberation Army in winning more victories at any time. The Ala Commune, where the Yi people live, was ravaged by the U.S. invasion army before liberation, and many people were killed, and many more became disabled. They are particularly angry at the crime of the American bandit plane invading our airspace. Wang Xiuzhen, whose father was killed by the U.S. military before liberation and who had her left arm broken by a U.S. military vehicle, said that the blood debts owed by U.S. imperialism are all recorded in our hearts. Now it has committed new crimes against the Chinese people, and we must resolutely fight it to the end.
    In the past few days, the broad masses of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the southwest border, while angrily condemning the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism, have further strengthened their combat readiness. From the air force airport to the anti-aircraft gun positions, from the barracks to the border outposts, everyone is determined to take the air force units that shot down the enemy plane as an example, hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, unite as one, intensify military training, pay close attention to the movements of U.S. imperialism in expanding its aggressive war, and be ready at any time to severely crack down on the American aggressors who dare to invade our country. The air force unit that shot down the enemy plane immediately summarized its combat experience and prepared to fight again after the battle. They said: "The victory in this battle is the result of the troops highlighting politics and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We must always bear in mind Chairman Mao's teaching of 'go all out and wipe out the invading enemy,' be prepared for war, and no matter whether the enemy plane is manned or unmanned, we will make sure that it does not return." Feng Quanmin, Lu Xiangxiao, Zhu Yilong, Li Yingshan and others, who have won merit in the battle to defend the motherland's airspace, recently reread Chairman Mao's article "Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle." They said that the enemy is not willing to fail, and they will definitely come again. We must be prepared, and we will beat down as many as they send.

    西南边疆军民百倍提高警惕，随时准备粉碎美帝一切侵略行动
    新华社十二日讯　中国人民解放军空军某部，今天在西南某地隆重举行祝捷授奖大会，热烈庆祝二月七日击落美帝国主义军用无人驾驶高空侦察机的重大胜利，奖励作战有功部队和人员。
    中国人民解放军空军副司令员徐深吉，当地部队和政府负责人查玉升、刘披云、刘懋功等出席了大会。
    当击落敌机的空军战士整队进入会场时，全场掌声雷动，经久不息。
    大会开始，空军副司令员徐深吉宣读了国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪颁发给作战有功部队的嘉奖令；当地空军部队负责人刘懋功宣读了这次作战中立功受奖的单位和指战员名单。徐深吉和西南地区部队负责人查玉升，在热烈的掌声中，分别把奖状授予立功单位代表和指战员。
    徐深吉在讲话中指出，这次战斗打得好，打得准，打得狠，充分显示了我军有我无敌的革命英雄主义气概，再一次生动地证明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。
    徐深吉强烈谴责美帝国主义猖狂扩大侵略越南的战争，并且不断向我进行军事挑衅的罪行。他勉励空军部队指战员，戒骄戒躁，谦虚谨慎，更加百倍提高警惕，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，并认真学习王杰、麦贤得和焦裕禄，把一切工作的立足点放在“打”字上，随时准备消灭一切胆敢来犯的敌人。
    当地政府负责人刘披云在讲话中表示，当地各族人民要学习参战部队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治的经验，加速社会主义革命和社会主义建设，并做好民兵工作“三落实”，坚决和人民解放军一起在西南边疆筑成一道铜墙铁壁。
    参战部队代表冯全民在讲话中表示，要继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，继续突出政治，扎扎实实地做好各项战备工作，随时准备投入战斗，为祖国、为人民争取更大的胜利。
    新华社十二日讯　我国西南边疆广大军民连日举行各种集会，热烈欢庆二月七日我空军部队在西南地区上空一举击落美帝军用无人驾驶高空侦察机一架的胜利，愤怒谴责美帝国主义进一步扩大侵略越南战争，加紧对我进行军事挑衅的罪行。斗志昂扬的边疆军民坚决表示，要学习打落敌机的空军部队有我无敌的战斗精神，百倍提高警惕，随时准备彻底粉碎美帝国主义的一切新的侵略行动。
    我空军部队击落入侵美国飞机的消息一传到祖国西南边疆，各族人民无不欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告。他们连声欢呼：“打得痛快！打得好！”许多目睹美国强盗飞机挨揍的群众，围着飞机残骸，振臂高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”愤怒谴责美国强盗的军事挑衅。许多边防战士和工人、农民、学生也都纷纷举行座谈，声讨美帝国主义的侵略罪行。边疆驻军某部五好战士丁立应在座谈会上说：“空军老大哥打下美国军用无人驾驶高空侦察机，是对美帝国主义猖狂扩大侵略越南战争和不断对我进行军事挑衅的有力打击，打得干脆、漂亮，真是大快人心。对付侵略者就要这样毫不留情地打。”家乡和越南民主共和国山水相连的某机关干部郭苗囡说：“我曾和越南人民同饮一江水，同赶一条街，美国强盗的炸弹炸在越南国土上，就象炸在我的心上一样。美帝国主义最近又在越南狂轰滥炸，并派出强盗飞机到我国领空进行侦察，这说明美帝国主义高唱的‘和谈’，完全是一个大阴谋、大骗局，永远也欺骗不了越南人民和世界人民。”解放前曾被美国侵略军的狼狗咬伤的昆明机床厂老工人沈留荣，八日清晨一下夜班，就参加了声讨美帝国主义侵略罪行的集会。他说，美国豺狼绝不会改变咬人的本性，我们一定要提高警惕，加紧生产，随时准备支援人民解放军打更多的胜仗。彝族人民聚居的阿拉公社，解放前曾遭美国侵略军蹂躏，许多人惨遭杀害，还有不少人成了残废。他们对美国强盗飞机侵入我国领空的罪行格外愤怒。解放前父亲被美军打死，自己又遭美军汽车压断左臂的王秀珍说，美帝国主义欠下的血债，我们都一笔笔记在心里。现在它又对中国人民犯下了新的罪行，我们必须坚决同它斗争到底。
    这几天，驻守西南边疆的人民解放军广大指战员，在愤怒谴责美帝国主义侵略罪行的同时，进一步加强了战备。从空军机场到高炮阵地，从营区到边防前哨，人人都决心以击落敌机的空军部队为榜样，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，团结一心，加紧练武，密切注意美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的动向，随时准备狠狠打击胆敢侵入我国的美国侵略者。击落敌机的空军部队，在战斗结束后，立即总结战斗经验，准备再战。他们说：“这次战斗的胜利是部队突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作的结果。我们要永远牢记毛主席‘全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌’的教导，常备不懈，不管敌机是有人驾驶还是无人驾驶，都叫它有来无回。”在保卫祖国领空的战斗中荣立战功的冯全民、鲁祥孝、朱以隆、李英善等，最近重读了毛主席《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》的文章。他们说，敌人是不甘心失败的，一定还要来，我们一定要准备好，来多少就揍下它多少。
