    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 3rd—The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a memorandum on the so-called "peace seeking" offensive of the United States on the 3rd. The full text is as follows:
    Since the end of December 1965, the US government has launched a "peace seeking" offensive, published the document "The Central Issues in the Vietnam Problem," and proposed the so-called "Fourteen Points Plan" for resolving the Vietnam issue. At the same time, it has clamored about a so-called "pause in bombing" of North Vietnam and heavily publicized the so-called "sincerity" of the United States.
    What new content is in the White House document? What is the essence of the American "peace seeking" offensive?

    (I)
    The White House document of January 3, 1966, rehashes the old tunes of the United States, while also addressing some issues that it has previously avoided. For example, it says that the 1954 Geneva Accords are the "foundation" for restoring peace in Southeast Asia; it also discusses the main issues of this agreement. The United States deliberately wants to make many people believe that it has already "made concessions" and seems to have accepted the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, except for the third point.
    In fact, the United States has not abandoned its policy of aggression against Vietnam. The White House document puts forward two points as the basis of its "Fourteen Points Plan," namely:
    First, it slanders the South Vietnamese people's anti-American patriotic struggle as "aggression from North Vietnam." The United States says bluntly that it will only withdraw its troops when this struggle stops.
    Second, the United States must undertake "obligations" to the Saigon regime and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.
    Vietnam is tens of thousands of miles away from the United States. The Vietnamese people have never offended the United States. In the past, it was US imperialism that interfered in Vietnam and helped the French colonialists carry out the war of aggression against Vietnam. The Vietnamese people's first war of resistance was victorious, and the 1954 Geneva Accords recognized the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the Vietnamese people. But US imperialism continued to grossly interfere in the internal affairs of the Vietnamese people; it fostered a fascist dictatorial puppet regime in Saigon and carried out a "special warfare" to suppress the patriotic movement of the South Vietnamese people. Recently, it sent a US expeditionary force, including 200,000 men, to directly invade South Vietnam; at the same time, it used its air force to attack the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The slander of the United States cannot deceive anyone. The so-called "undertaking obligations" is nothing more than collusion between master and servant to undermine the Geneva Accords. It absolutely cannot be used to cancel out its statement at the 1954 Geneva Conference. This statement is that the United States "will not use threats or force to impede them (the Geneva Accords)." Obviously, US imperialism has seriously violated the 1954 Geneva Accords.
    The United States says that it does not want to keep American troops in South Vietnam, but the condition is that this will happen "after peace is assured," or "when the South Vietnamese people have the right to decide their own destiny without external interference." In fact, it is the United States that is invading South Vietnam, undermining peace, infringing upon Vietnamese sovereignty, and interfering in the internal affairs of the South Vietnamese people. Only when US troops withdraw from South Vietnam will there be peace in South Vietnam, and the right of self-determination of the South Vietnamese people can be respected. Obviously, the United States imperialism’s cunning argument mentioned above is deliberately intended to keep American troops in South Vietnam.
    The United States says that it does not need American military bases in Southeast Asia and that it respects the wishes of Southeast Asian countries that are willing to follow a neutral or non-aligned path. But at the same time, the United States says that it wants to "undertake" its "obligations" to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. As everyone knows, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a military aggressive group established by the United States with the purpose of opposing the Geneva Accords on the issue of Indochina. The United States arbitrarily designated South Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos, and the Kingdom of Cambodia as within the "protection" scope of this group, undermining and infringing on the neutrality and sovereignty of Laos and Cambodia. Obviously, the United States is still plotting to place Indochina and Southeast Asian countries in the US military base system in order to suppress the national liberation movement in this region.
    The United States says that it supports free elections in South Vietnam so that the South Vietnamese people can have a government of their own choice, but the condition is that this must happen "after the Viet Cong lay down their weapons and accept amnesty" (US Secretary of State Rusk's statement on December 23, 1965). Obviously, the United States wants the South Vietnamese people to surrender and recognize the Saigon puppet regime fostered by the US government.
    For eleven years, the US support for the Saigon puppet regime has been the only obstacle to the unification of Vietnam. If the United States still clings to that traitorous and harmful regime, and if the United States refuses to withdraw its troops from South Vietnam, then what they say about the unification of Vietnam is completely hypocritical.
    The US reactionary position on the main issues of the Geneva Accords, and the US actions to undermine this agreement, have exposed that the United States completely disrespects the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue. This also explains why the United States refuses to accept the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, because these four points most faithfully embody the main provisions of the 1954 Geneva Accords.
    The United States says that it can accept the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, except for the third point. The third point is: "The affairs of South Vietnam must be resolved by the South Vietnamese people themselves according to the program of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, and no foreign interference is allowed." As everyone knows, the program of the National Liberation Front is to unite the entire people to strive for the independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality of the South, and then peacefully unify the motherland; to establish in the South a broad national democratic coalition government including representatives from all strata of the people, all ethnic groups, all parties, all religions, and all patriotic people. This program fully complies with the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue and the wishes of all the South Vietnamese people. This is the most important of the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and it is connected with other points as a whole. The United States does not recognize this point because it believes that the South Vietnamese people can only decide their own affairs under the occupation of US troops, after surrendering to the United States, and accepting the rule of the puppet regime fostered by the United States. Opposing the program of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front is opposing the South Vietnamese people's right to national self-determination, and opposing the basic national rights of the Vietnamese people.
    The United States says that if "Hanoi stops its aggression," it will "not be difficult for representatives of the Southern National Liberation Front to participate and put forward their opinions." The US-so-called "aggression by Hanoi" is actually the patriotic struggle of the South Vietnamese people against US aggression. The United States’ proposal for the condition of "Hanoi stopping its aggression" means that the South Vietnamese people must lay down their weapons. The actual situation in South Vietnam is: American aggressors are trampling on Vietnamese territory; the South Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front, are fighting for self-defense. If the United States really wants peace, then it must recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the only true representative of the South Vietnamese people and must negotiate with the National Liberation Front.
    In order to strengthen its deceptiveness, the United States is also playing the trick of "pausing the bombing of North Vietnam." This is a means of deceiving public opinion, attempting to slander the Vietnamese people as "not wanting peace" and finding excuses to strengthen the war of aggression. When the United States had just "paused the bombing" of North Vietnam, the Pentagon generals clamored to resume bombing, and even clamored to use B-52 strategic bombers. Johnson himself blatantly demanded on January 12, 1966, that the Vietnamese people must "make a choice between peace and destruction." This is shameless blackmail, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to accept the conditions of the so-called "unconditional discussion" of the United States.
    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is an independent and sovereign country that no one may violate. The bombing and strafing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by American aircraft is an extremely barbaric act of aggression, violating the 1954 Geneva Accords on the issue of Indochina and violating the norms of international law. The Vietnamese people demand that the United States must permanently stop the bombing and any other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam without any conditions.
    The "Fourteen Points Plan" and the "pause in bombing North Vietnam" are both conspiracies by the United States to negotiate from a position of strength and a means of forcing the Vietnamese people to submit to the American aggressors. The United States wants to get from the conference table what it cannot get on the battlefield.
    The essence of the American "Fourteen Points Plan" is the American attempt to stay in South Vietnam and to permanently divide Vietnam. The American "peace seeking" offensive is only to cover up its conspiracy to strengthen the war of aggression. The position of the Johnson administration is still aggression and expanding the war.

    (II)
    While the US authorities are clamoring about "peace" and "sincerity," they are constantly strengthening and expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. They are asking the US Congress to allocate 10.5 billion US dollars for the Vietnam War in the next fiscal year, equivalent to twice last year; they are also asking for an additional 12.7 billion US dollars in special expenses.
    Many senior Pentagon officials, such as Secretary of Defense McNamara, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler, Secretary of the Air Force Brown, Secretary of the Army Resor, Marine Corps Commandant Greene, and Army Chief of Staff Harold Johnson have successively gone to Saigon to deploy plans to strengthen the war.
    In just one month, during which the United States launched a deceptive new "peace" offensive, the United States sent 13,000 troops to South Vietnam, including two brigades of the 25th Infantry Division and a regiment of the Marine Corps, increasing the total number of US expeditionary forces in the South to more than 200,000. US newspapers revealed that the US authorities also plan to increase the number of US troops in South Vietnam to 400,000 this year. While increasing troops, many new types of war tools, such as jet fighters and tanks equipped with ninety-millimeter caliber cannons, are also being shipped into South Vietnam. The United States is also stepping up the consolidation and expansion of military airports and naval ports in the South.
    While increasing troops, US imperialism is taking extremely barbaric measures to wage a war of destruction in South Vietnam. The heavy artillery of the US Seventh Fleet warships continuously bombards many densely populated coastal areas. US B-52 aircraft taking off from Guam airbases indiscriminately bomb villages, schools, churches, temples, etc., killing innocent residents and destroying houses and crops. From December 25, 1965, to January 24, 1966, B-52 aircraft conducted a total of seventeen bombing raids. US newspapers also revealed that in the new fiscal year, the US government will spend a budget of 500 million US dollars as the cost of B-52 aircraft bombing South Vietnam. The American aggressors use chemical poisons and poisonous gas as weapons of mass murder on a large scale. Poison gas is used as "basic standard equipment" to arm the American troops in South Vietnam. They use helicopters and guns to throw and launch many poison gas bombs, polluting the air in vast areas. The American aggressors also widely released various high-concentration poisonous gases into villages and resident shelters, poisoning tens of thousands of residents, with a large number of residents dying, most of whom were women and children.
    Particularly serious is that recently, the American army and its servant troops have also conducted many "scorched earth" military operations on a large scale. In the last few days of January this year alone, they dispatched 40,000 troops to conduct five "sweeps" at the same time, indiscriminately destroying many vast residential areas in South Vietnam. In these military operations, they killed all, burned all, and destroyed all, committing extremely barbaric crimes in many places. In just one "sweep" conducted by 8,000 American troops and their servant troops from January 8 to 19 against six townships 30 kilometers northwest of Saigon, they killed a large number of innocent residents, burned 1,500 houses, destroyed all the furniture, destroyed 200 tons of rice, killed 200 water buffaloes and oxen, and thousands of other livestock, and used poison gas to kill people hiding in shelters.
    US imperialism has exposed its face as the most barbaric war criminal of the contemporary era. All the Vietnamese people and all progressive mankind strongly protest the US imperialism’s "scorched earth" policy and extremely barbaric means of killing people.
    In North Vietnam, from the time the United States began to clamor about "pausing the bombing" to January 30, 1966, American aircraft invaded the airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam nearly 400 times, conducting provocative activities and preparing for new air raids. On January 5 and 14, 1966, American aircraft bombed and strafed villages in the western region of Thanh Hoa province. From January 1 to 30, 1966, three American unmanned aircraft, one helicopter, and two jet aircraft were shot down in North Vietnam.
    On January 31, 1966, the US Air Force, according to plan, continued to bomb and strafe Hon Go Island north of the demilitarized zone and many residential areas in Quang Binh, Nghe An, Thanh Hoa, and Son La provinces, ending the trick of "pausing the bombing of North Vietnam."
    The US strengthening and expansion of the war against South Vietnam and the continued bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as blatant acts of aggression clearly prove that the United States talks about false "peace" and conducts true war.
    While US imperialism is unprecedentedly intensifying its "scorched earth" military operations against South Vietnam and continuing to barbarically bomb and strafe North Vietnam, it is also replaying despicable tricks that have long gone bankrupt, bringing the Vietnam issue to the United Nations Security Council, attempting to cover up its new sinful actions against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and using the United Nations organization to strengthen its aggression against Vietnam.
    On the other hand, the US authorities are frantically strengthening their military activities in Laos, preparing to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to the entire Indochina, seriously threatening the independence and neutrality of Laos and Cambodia.
    In Laos, the US Air Force has been continuously bombing day and night, "reaching 300 sorties per day, dropping nearly 1,000 tons of bombs and rockets," destroying many houses and temples, and killing many innocent people. The US-backed troops in Laos are pushing forward plans for large-scale offensives into areas controlled by the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces. The United States is also planning to send American troops and its South Vietnamese and Thai puppet troops to participate in the war in central and lower Laos.
    Regarding Cambodia, while American and its puppet aircraft are conducting provocative activities against the Cambodian border areas, the American aggressors are also playing the trick of slandering Cambodia as an excuse to expand the war of aggression against this kingdom. They also blatantly authorized American troops to fire into Cambodia, and even invade the country’s territory. According to the US plan, the Thai authorities have also successively invaded the Cambodian border, strengthening armed provocations against Cambodia.
    The United States is also stepping up its efforts to turn its bases in Thailand into huge military bases, attempting to "play a huge role in the United States' upcoming offensive plans in Vietnam and Indochina."
    The US intensifying its barbaric war of aggression against South Vietnam, and its conspiracies and actions to expand this war, have completely exposed the warlike and extremely brutal face of US imperialism, and also exposed the deceptive nature of Johnson's so-called "peace seeking" offensive.
    The peace-loving people of the world who have strongly opposed the US's cunning arguments of "peace negotiations" and "unconditional discussions" in the past will certainly not be deceived by the US government's "peace seeking" offensive now.
    Many national governments, many international democratic organizations, many people, and world opinion, including progressive public opinion in the United States, have pointed out that "the American peace seeking offensive is a prelude to a larger-scale and crueler intensification of the war of aggression"; "the peace offensive and further expansion of the war of aggression are inseparable"; "Johnson, Rusk, and McNamara are definitely not peace-loving people," but "war criminals who should be tried."
    The Vietnamese people, after eleven years of struggle against US imperialism and its lackeys, clearly know the true face of the American aggressors and will never be deceived or intimidated by them.
    The Vietnamese people very much hope for peace to build their own country, but the Vietnamese people clearly know that to have true peace, there must be true independence.
    For eleven years, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently believed that the 1954 Geneva Accords must be strictly implemented to guarantee the basic national rights of the Vietnamese people and to guarantee peace in Vietnam and Indochina. On April 8, 1965, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam put forward a four-point proposal for resolving the Vietnam issue. The position of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always been a peaceful one.
    As President Ho Chi Minh said in his letter to the heads of many countries on January 24, 1966: "If the US government truly wants a peaceful solution, then they must recognize the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and prove it with practical actions; they must permanently and unconditionally stop the bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Only in this way can a political solution to the Vietnam issue be considered."
    The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declares that any solution that violates the above-mentioned position is inappropriate; any solution that attempts to use the United Nations to interfere in Vietnam is also inappropriate, because such a solution fundamentally violates the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue.
    As long as US imperialism continues to wage its war of aggression against South Vietnam and uses its air force to bomb and strafe the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the people of both North and South Vietnam will not hesitate to sacrifice themselves, resolutely fight to the end, and be determined to complete their sacred mission, defend the sovereignty of the motherland and the independence of the nation, and contribute to defending peace in Southeast Asia and the world.
    US imperialism’s policy of aggression against Vietnam and all its deceptive means are bound to be met with shameful failure.
                                February 3, 1966

### 越南外交部发表关于美国“和平攻势”的备忘录  美国假和平真战争面目再次暴露无遗  越南人民骗不了吓不倒坚决抗战到底

    越南外交部发表关于美国“和平攻势”的备忘录
    美国假和平真战争面目再次暴露无遗
    越南人民骗不了吓不倒坚决抗战到底
    新华社河内三日电　越南民主共和国外交部三日发表了关于美国的所谓“谋求和平”攻势的备忘录，全文如下：
    自一九六五年十二月底以来，美国政府展开了“谋求和平”的攻势，公布了“越南问题的中心”的文件，提出了所谓解决越南问题的“十四点计划”。同时，它还叫嚷所谓“暂停轰炸”越南北方，并大肆宣传所谓美国的“诚意”。
    白宫的文件有什么新内容？美国的“谋求和平”攻势的实质又是什么？
    （一）
    白宫的一九六六年一月三日的文件重弹美国的老调，同时也谈到它向来规避的一些问题。例如它说一九五四年日内瓦协议，是恢复东南亚和平的“基础”；它还谈到这个协议的主要问题。美国故意要使许多人相信它已经“让步”，除了第三项外，它似乎已经接受了越南民主共和国的四项主张。
    事实上，美国并没有放弃对越南的侵略政策。白宫的文件提出了两点，作为它的“十四点计划”的基础，即：
    一、诬蔑越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争是“越南北方的侵略”。美国露骨地说，只有在这个斗争停止的时候，美国才肯撤军。
    二、美国必须承担对西贡政权、对东南亚集体防务条约组织的“义务”。
    越南远离美国万里。越南人民从来没有触犯到美国。过去，正是美帝国主义干涉了越南，帮助法国殖民者进行侵略越南的战争。越南人民的第一次抗战胜利了，一九五四年日内瓦协议承认越南人民的独立、主权、统一和领土完整。但是美帝国主义继续粗暴地干涉越南人民的内部事务；它在西贡扶植了法西斯独裁走狗政权，进行了镇压越南南方人民爱国运动的“特种战争”。最近，它又派遣包括二十万人的一支美国远征军直接侵略越南南方；同时使用空军袭击越南民主共和国。美国的诬蔑是骗不了任何人的，美国的所谓“承担义务”的鬼话，只不过是主奴之间的勾结以便破坏日内瓦协议而已，绝对不能借此勾销它在一九五四年日内瓦会议上的声明。这个声明是，美国
  “将不使用威胁或武力去妨害它们（日内瓦协议）”。显然，美帝国主义已经严重地破坏了一九五四年日内瓦协议。
    美国说什么并不想把美军留在越南南方，但条件是要在“和平得到确保”以后，或“在越南南方人民有权自己决定自己的命运而不受外界干涉的时候”。事实上，正是美国在侵略越南南方，破坏和平，侵犯越南主权，干涉越南南方人民的内部事务。只有美军撤出越南南方，越南南方才会有和平，越南南方人民的自决权才能得到尊重。显然，美帝国主义提出上述的狡猾论调是蓄意要把美军留在越南南方。
    美国说什么它不需要东南亚的美国军事基地，美国尊重愿意遵循中立或不结盟路线的东南亚各国的愿望。但同时，美国又说它要“承担”对东南亚集体防务条约组织的“义务”。众所周知，东南亚集体防务条约组织是由美国成立起来的一个军事侵略集团，其目的是反对关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议。美国横蛮地把越南南方、老挝王国和柬埔寨王国划入这个集团的“保护”范围内，破坏和侵犯老挝和柬埔寨的中立和主权。显然，美国仍然阴谋把印度支那和东南亚各国置于美国的军事基地体系中，以便镇压这一地区的民族解放运动。
    美国说什么它支持在越南南方举行自由选举，使越南南方人民有一个他们自己选择的政府，但条件是必须在“越共放下武器并接受大赦”之后（美国国务卿腊斯克一九六五年十二月二十三日的声明）。显然，美国是要越南南方人民投降，并承认由美国政府扶植起来的西贡傀儡政权。
    十一年来，美国对西贡傀儡政权的扶植，是越南国家统一的唯一阻碍。如果美国还对那个卖国殃民的政权死抱住不放，如果美国不肯从越南南方撤出军队，那么，它们说的有关越南统一的话都完全是虚伪的。
    美国对日内瓦协议各主要问题的反动立场，以及美国对这个协议的破坏行动，已暴露了美国对一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议是完全不尊重的。这一点也说明了为什么美国不肯接受越南民主共和国政府的四项主张，因为这四项主张是最忠实地体现了一九五四年日内瓦协议的主要条款。
    美国说什么除了第三项外，可以接受越南民主共和国政府的四项主张。第三项是：“越南南方事务必须根据越南南方民族解放阵线纲领，由越南南方人民自己来解决，不许外国干涉”。众所周知，民族解放阵线的纲领是，团结全民，争取南方的独立、民主、和平和中立，进而和平统一祖国；在南方成立一个包括各阶层人民、各民族、各党派、各宗教的代表，以及各个爱国人士参加的广泛的民族民主联合政府。这个纲领完全符合一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议和全体越南南方人民的愿望。这是越南民主共和国政府四项主张中最重要的一项，它和其他各项连成一个整体。美国不承认这一项，因为它认为：越南南方人民只有在美国军队的占领下，在向美国投降、并接受美国扶植起来的傀儡政权的统治之后，才能决定自己的事务。反对越南南方民族解放阵线的纲领，就是反对越南南方人民的民族自决权，就是反对越南人民的基本民族权利。
    美国说什么如果“河内停止侵略”，南方民族解放阵线“派代表参加和提出他们的意见并不会有什么困难”。美国的所谓“河内的侵略”，实际是越南南方人民反对美国侵略的爱国斗争。美国提出“河内停止侵略”的条件，是意味着要越南南方人民放下武器。目前越南南方的实际情况是：美国侵略者正在践踏着越南国土；越南南方人民在民族解放阵线的领导下，正在为自卫而战斗。如果美国当真想和平，那么就必须承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民的唯一真正代表，必须与民族解放阵线进行谈判。
    为了加强其欺骗性，美国还玩弄“暂停轰炸北越”的把戏。这是一种欺骗舆论的手段，企图诬蔑越南人民是“不想和平”，为加强侵略战争寻找借口。在美国刚刚“暂停轰炸”越南北方的时候，五角大楼的将领们就大肆叫嚷要恢复轰炸，甚至叫嚣要使用B—52型战略轰炸机。约翰逊本人在一九六六年一月十二日也明目张胆地要越南人民必须在“和平与破坏之间作一抉择”。这是无耻的讹诈，企图强迫越南人民接受美国所谓“无条件讨论”的条件。
    越南民主共和国是一个独立、拥有主权的国家，任何人不得侵犯。美国飞机对越南民主共和国的轰炸、扫射，是一种极端野蛮的侵略行动，违反了一九五四年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议，违反了国际法准则。越南人民要求美国必须永远地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他任何战争行动，而不得提出任何条件。
      “十四点计划”，以及“暂停轰炸北越”都是美国为了实现在实力地位上进行谈判的阴谋、迫使越南人民向美国侵略者屈服的手段。美国想从会议桌上获得它在战场上所得不到的东西。
    美国的“十四点计划”的实质是美国企图死赖在越南南方，妄图长期分割越南。美国的“谋求和平”的攻势只是为了掩盖其加强侵略战争的阴谋而已。约翰逊政府的立场仍然是侵略和扩大战争。
    （二）
    美国当局一面叫嚷“和平”，“诚意”，另一方面却不断加强和扩大侵略越南的战争。它们要求美国国会在下一财政年度中给越南战争拨款一百零五亿美元，相当于去年的两倍；它们还另外要求一百二十七亿美元的特别费用。
    五角大楼的许多高级官员，如国防部长麦克纳马拉、参谋长联席会议主席惠勒、空军部长布朗、陆军部长里索、海军陆战队司令格林、陆军参谋长哈罗德·约翰逊等相继到西贡部署加强战争的计划。
    仅在美国展开骗人的新的“和平”攻势的一个月里，美国就向越南南方增派了一万三千名军队，其中包括第二十五步兵师的两个旅和海军陆战队一个团，把在南方的美国远征军总数增至二十万名以上。美国报刊透露，美国当局还打算在今年内把在越南南方的美军增加到四十万名。在增兵的同时，象喷气式战斗机、装有九十毫米口径火炮的坦克等许多新式战争工具也正在运进越南南方。美国还正在加紧巩固和扩大在南方的军用机场和军港。
    在增兵的同时，美帝国主义正在采取极端野蛮的手段，在越南南方进行一场毁灭性的战争。美国第七舰队军舰的重炮连续不断地轰击沿海许多居民稠密区。从关岛基地起飞的美国B— 52型飞机向村庄、学校、教堂、寺庙等滥肆轰炸，杀害无辜居民，破坏房屋和庄稼。在一九六五年十二月二十五日到一九六六年一月二十四日期间，B—52型飞机总共进行了十七次轰炸。美国报刊还透露说，在新的财政年度里，美国政府将支出五亿美元的预算作为B—52型飞机轰炸越南南方所需的费用。美国侵略者把化学毒药和毒气作为成批地杀人的武器而大规模地加以使用。毒气被当为“基本的标准的装备”来武装在越南南方的美国军队。他们使用直升飞机和枪炮扔掷和发射许多毒气弹，使广大地区的空气染毒。美国侵略者还广泛地向村庄和居民隐避所施放多种高浓度的毒气，使数以万计的居民中毒，大批居民死亡，其中大都是妇女和儿童。
    特别严重的是，最近，美国军队及其仆从军队还大规模地进行多次“焦土”军事行动。仅在今年一月的最后几天，他们就出动四万名军队同时进行五次“扫荡”，滥肆破坏越南南方的许多广大居民区。在这些军事行动中，他们杀光、烧光和毁光，在许多地方犯下了极端野蛮的罪行。仅在美国军队及其仆从军队八千名从一月八日到十九日对距离西贡西北三十公里的六个乡进行的一次“扫荡”中，它们就杀害大批无辜居民，烧毁一千五百栋房屋，破坏所有的家具，毁坏二百吨稻谷，打死水牛和黄牛二百头以及其它家畜成千头，并用毒气来杀害躲在隐避所里的人民。
    美帝国主义已经暴露了它是当代最野蛮的战争罪犯的面目。全体越南人民、全体进步人类强烈抗议美帝国主义的“焦土”政策和极其野蛮的杀人手段。
    在越南北方，从美国开始叫嚷“暂停轰炸”到一九六六年一月三十日期间，美国飞机曾经近四百次侵犯越南民主共和国的领空，进行挑衅活动和为新的空袭作准备。一九六六年一月五日和十四日，美国飞机曾轰炸、扫射了清化省西部地区的村庄。从一九六六年一月一日到三十日，美国无人驾驶飞机三架、直升飞机一架和喷气式飞机两架在越南北方被击落。
    一九六六年一月三十一日，美国空军按照预定计划，又继续轰炸、扫射非军事区以北的昏果岛以及广平、义安、清化和山萝等省的许多居民区，结束了“暂停轰炸北越”的把戏。
    美国加强和扩大对越南南方的战争和继续空袭越南民主共和国的明目张胆的侵略行动，清楚地证明：美国口谈假“和平”，进行真战争。
    美帝国主义空前地加紧对越南南方的“焦土”军事行动和继续野蛮地对越南北方进行轰炸、扫射的同时，还在重新玩弄早已破产的卑鄙花招，把越南问题提到联合国安全理事会，企图掩盖它对越南民主共和国的新的罪恶行动，并且利用联合国组织来加强对越南的侵略。
    另方面，美国当局正在疯狂加强它对老挝的军事活动，准备把侵略越南的战争扩大到整个印度支那，严重地威胁着老挝和柬埔寨的独立和中立。
    在老挝，美国空军夜以继日地接连进行轰炸，“每天达三百架次，投下近一千吨的炸弹和火箭”，毁坏许多房屋和庙宇，杀害许多无辜人民。美国在老挝的走狗军队正在推行大规模进攻老挝爱国战线党和老挝爱国中立力量控制地区的计划。美国还正在筹划派遣美军及其南越和泰国的走狗军队进入中寮和下寮地区参战。
    对于柬埔寨，当美国及其走狗飞机对柬埔寨边境地区进行挑衅活动的同时，美国侵略者还玩弄诬蔑柬埔寨的手段，以作为把侵略战争扩大到这个王国的借口。他们还明目张胆地授权美军可以向柬埔寨境内开枪，甚至侵犯这个国家的领土。根据美国的计划，泰国当局也接连侵犯柬埔寨边境，加强对柬埔寨的武装挑衅。
    美国还正在加紧把它在泰国的基地建设成为庞大的军事基地，妄图为美国在越南和印度支那“即将到来的进攻计划起着巨大的作用”。
    美国正在越南南方加强野蛮的侵略战争以及它扩大这一战争的阴谋和行动，已经完全揭穿了美帝国主义的好战和极端残暴的面目，同时也暴露了约翰逊所谓“谋求和平”攻势的欺骗性质。
    过去曾经强烈反对美国“和平谈判”和“无条件讨论”狡猾论调的世界爱好和平人民，现在也绝不会被美国政府的“谋求和平”攻势所欺骗。
    许多国家政府，许多国际民主组织、许多人士，以及包括美国进步舆论在内的世界舆论已经指出，“美国的谋求和平攻势是更大规模地和残酷地加强侵略战争的序曲”；“和平攻势和进一步扩大侵略战争形影不离”；“约翰逊、腊斯克和麦克纳马拉，绝对不是热爱和平的人”，而是“应该审判的战争罪犯”。
    越南人民经过十一年反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，很清楚地知道美国侵略者的真面目，绝不会被他们所欺骗或吓倒。
    越南人民很希望有和平来建设自己的国家，但是越南人民清楚地知道，要有真正的和平，就必须有真正的独立。
    十一年来，越南民主共和国政府一贯认为，必须严正履行一九五四年日内瓦协议，以保证越南人民的基本民族权利，保证越南和印度支那的和平。一九六五年四月八日，越南民主共和国政府提出了关于解决越南问题的四项主张。越南民主共和国政府的立场始终不渝地是和平的立场。
    正如胡志明主席一九六六年一月二十四日在给许多国家首脑的信中曾经说的：“如果美国政府真正愿意和平解决，那么它们就必须承认越南民主共和国政府的四项主张，并且以实际行动来证明；必须永远地和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和一切其他战争行动。这样才能考虑到越南问题的政治解决办法”。
    越南民主共和国政府声明，违反上述立场的一切解决办法都是不适宜的；想用联合国来干涉越南的一切解决办法也都是不适宜的，因为，这样的解决办法根本上是同一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议相违背的。
    只要美帝国主义还继续对越南南方进行侵略战争，用空军轰炸、扫射越南民主共和国，越南南北两方人民就决不惜牺牲，坚决抗战到底，决心完成自己的神圣任务，保卫祖国的主权和民族的独立，并为保卫东南亚和世界和平作出贡献。
    美帝国主义对越南的侵略政策和它们的一切欺骗手段，必定遭到可耻的失败。
                              一九六六年二月三日
