    Going Deep Among the Masses to Paint Heroes
    --Some Experiences in Creating the "Shi Chuanxiang" Series
    Beijing Painting Academy　Wei Jiangfan
    In 1964, after reading Comrade Shi Chuanxiang's article "Let the Proletarian Revolutionary Spirit Be Passed Down from Generation to Generation" in the newspaper, I thought about going to live at the Chongwen District Cleaning Team. This idea received encouragement and support from the leadership, and in early March of last year, Comrade Yin Shoushi and I went to the youth squad with our luggage.
    We labored with the workers during the day and slept in the collective dormitory at night. At first, the worker comrades warmly took care of me, only letting me carry a little manure. However, because I had been divorced from labor for a long time, I still rubbed my shoulder raw and felt pain all over. At that time, I felt a little shaken, thinking: there are so many factories and rural areas in Beijing, why did I choose to come here? At this time, I opened Chairman Mao's works and saw that Chairman Mao said: "If you want to become one with the masses, you must make up your mind and go through a long and even painful period of tempering." Seeing the scene of Comrade Shi Chuanxiang, who was over fifty years old, working with the young workers selflessly, I was greatly educated and inspired and resolved to persevere.
    The hands and bodies of Comrade Shi Chuanxiang and the young workers were covered in manure, but their souls were the cleanest! Shi Chuanxiang proudly said: "Our hauling manure is doing revolution, it is defending the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao and the health of the people of the capital." When the young workers saw the manure, they happily said, "Great! This kind of manure, when applied to the land, can produce more grain to support national construction and world revolution!" What a noble thought, truly carrying manure buckets while having the motherland in their hearts and the world in their eyes. I am an art worker, and thinking back to how I treated art work in the past, it was not like this. Consciously or unconsciously, I regarded technology and knowledge as private property. Shi Chuanxiang and the youth squad were hauling manure for the revolution, but I had not had the thought of painting for the revolution for a long time. In this sharp contrast, in the process of hauling manure, I realized that what I was hauling was not only manure, but more importantly, the bourgeois stinking thoughts in my mind.
    Living together with Comrade Shi Chuanxiang made me deeply feel that a literary and art worker must first solve the problem of their worldview, must shift their footing to the side of the workers, peasants and soldiers, in order to have common feelings and a common language with the workers, peasants and soldiers, and to have a keen ability to perceive life. Once, when I was riding a bus with Comrade Shi Chuanxiang, he quickly noticed that a young woman was sick and immediately got up to give her his seat. I thought at the time, why is Comrade Shi Chuanxiang, who is over fifty years old, more discerning than me? This is because he is always concerned about others and always thinks of others. He didn't tell me any great truths, but his actions were more persuasive education. If we truly learn from Chairman Mao's works, like Comrade Shi Chuanxiang, observing life with class feelings, and like him, loving the Party and enthusiastically caring about the lives of the masses, then we can discover the great theme of communism and the noble spiritual world of heroic figures, so that our works can better serve the people and encourage the people to move forward.
    Shi Chuanxiang proudly said: "I have been hauling manure for more than thirty years. For the cause of the Party, I am willing to haul for another thirty years." Living in the youth squad for four months was an unforgettable lesson for me, making me realize that Comrade Shi Chuanxiang and the young workers are the ordinary but great heroes of our time. It made me understand a truth: a person's ability may be great or small, but as long as they have the spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self, they are a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who has broken away from low tastes, and a person who is beneficial to the people. Such a person is precisely the example we should learn from, and precisely the object that our literature and art should express and eulogize.
    We were determined to use our brushes to paint the feelings of living in the youth squad. Manure and manure workers were generally considered unsuitable for painting in the past. In the common labor with the workers, our feelings have changed. We deeply felt that painting such paintings is our political responsibility, this is to create images for the shining heroes of our time!
    However, there were many moving deeds of Shi Chuanxiang and the youth squad, where to start? Those life scenes that had inspired and educated us for four months appeared one by one, no longer like before when we were closed off and racking our brains to find creative themes. Now the problem was how to be more concentrated, more generalized, and better to express them. With the help of leaders and comrades, the theme was determined, and it was decided to adopt the form of a series of paintings to reflect the revolutionary spiritual outlook of Shi Chuanxiang and the youth squad. The "Classroom for Cultivating Revolutionary Spirit," "Warm Water and Warm Hearts," "Passing on the Style of Hard Struggle," and "Becoming a People's Representative," which participated in the North China New Year Picture and Print Exhibition this time, are four of the series.
    "Classroom for Cultivating Revolutionary Spirit" reflects the scene of people from all walks of life participating in labor in the youth squad, in order to express people's love and respect for ordinary labor, and to promote the idea that all work is for the revolution. The picture shows police, college students, soldiers, and government officials carrying manure together with Shi Chuanxiang. Why do we put the police in a prominent position? Because we have heard more than once from the old manure haulers complaining that in the old society, it was commonplace for the police to beat and scold the manure haulers. Once, Shi Chuanxiang spilled manure on the street, and the police came over and hit him with three batons, leaving three bloody welts on his body through his cotton-padded clothes. After being beaten, he didn't want to do it anymore, but in that dark old society, he didn't even have the freedom to quit. The manure bully colluded with the police to beat him severely. Therefore, the new society's police comrades' participation in carrying manure especially moved the workers. Therefore, when I was composing the picture, I unhesitatingly placed the people's police in a more important position.
    "Warm Water and Warm Hearts" expresses the love and respect of the people for the manure haulers. In the old society, manure haulers were not respected. Comrade Shi Chuanxiang often told a heartbreaking story: before liberation, he went to a lawyer's house to haul manure. It was hot and he was thirsty and wanted some water to drink. The lawyer was afraid of dirtying his family's water ladle, so he asked the old maid to scoop some water for him in a cat's bowl. Now, when we are working, we often encounter old ladies and Young Pioneers delivering tea and water, and delivering straw hats when it rains. Shi Chuanxiang himself is very moved whenever he mentions these things. He repeatedly said: "This is because the Party and Chairman Mao have taught us well!" I have been thinking, I have seen a lot of things like delivering water, and I take it as ordinary; Shi Chuanxiang is always very excited, and every time he thinks of the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao. This is precisely his specific manifestation of never forgetting the bitterness of the class, never forgetting the origin, loving the Party, loving Chairman Mao, loving the new society, and maintaining revolutionary enthusiasm forever. We painted this painting with this understanding.
    Although we did not bring sketchbooks this time, when we were creating the composition, the images of Shi Chuanxiang and the young workers appeared vividly in our minds. I think this is the initial sweetness we have tasted in following Chairman Mao's teachings. Of course, these four paintings are far from being able to summarize the spiritual outlook of Comrade Shi Chuanxiang and the youth squad. We are prepared to listen to opinions from all sides and continue to process and improve them.
    During the creation of the series of paintings, we had a deeper understanding of the "three-way combination" creation method. In the process of creation, the leading comrades repeatedly pointed out to us: we must highlight politics, we must portray the heroic image well, we must have the atmosphere of life, and constantly correct our direction and improve our understanding. Before, when painting, we only showed the initial draft to a few colleagues. Now we realize that since painting is for the worker-peasant-soldier masses, we must worship the worker-peasant-soldier masses as teachers and humbly listen to their opinions. We have taken the paintings to the cleaning team more than once to solicit opinions.
    In the draft of the painting "Classroom for Cultivating Revolutionary Spirit," the three manure haulers in the back were relatively stiff. The leading comrade of the cleaning team said: "It would be more energetic to paint them walking with their heads held high!" In the painting "Becoming a People's Representative," we originally wanted to show Shi Chuanxiang and the representatives walking towards the Great Hall of the People, with two pillar bases in the background. But the workers unanimously believed that the painting should show the entire front view of the Great Hall of the People, and they said that this would be "more imposing." Later, we changed it according to these opinions.
    Recalling that the reason why my past creations were not very successful, the most fundamental reason was that my worldview had not been transformed and I had not combined with the workers, peasants and soldiers, just as Chairman Mao taught us: "If intellectuals do not combine with the worker-peasant masses, they will accomplish nothing." Both one's own thoughts and feelings and artistic tastes must be thoroughly transformed in the process of learning from the worker-peasant-soldier masses, in order to create works that are needed and welcomed by the workers, peasants and soldiers.

    深入群众画英雄
    ——创作《时传祥》组画的几点体会
    北京画院　韦江凡
    一九六四年在报上看到了时传祥同志《让无产阶级革命精神代代传》的文章，我便想到崇文区清洁队去生活。这个想法得到领导上的鼓励与支持，去年三月初，我和尹瘦石同志便带着行李来到了青年班。
    我们白天和工人们一起劳动，晚上睡在集体宿舍里。开始时，工人同志们热情地照顾我，只让我背一点粪。但是，由于我长期脱离劳动，结果仍把肩磨破了，浑身酸痛。当时我有些动摇，心想：北京有那么多的工厂、农村，我为什么非选择到这儿呢？这时，打开毛主席著作，看到毛主席说：“你要和群众打成一片，就得下决心，经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。”再看看五十多岁的时传祥同志和青年工人一起忘我地劳动的情景，受到了很大的教育和激励，下决心坚持下去。
    时传祥同志和青年工人们的手上、身上有大粪，他们的灵魂却是最干净的！时传祥自豪地说：“我们掏大粪是干革命，是保卫党中央、毛主席和首都人民的健康。”青年工人们看到大粪，高兴地说：“好啊！这种粪上到地里可以多打粮食，支援国家建设和世界革命！”这是多么高尚的思想啊，真是身背粪桶，心怀祖国，放眼世界。我是个美术工作者，回想自己以前对待美术工作却不是这样，自觉不自觉地把技术和知识作为私有，时传祥和青年班是为革命而掏粪，我却长期没有为革命而画画的思想。在这种鲜明的对比下，在掏粪的过程中，我体会到掏的不仅是大粪，更重要的是掏了我脑子里的资产阶级臭思想。
    在和时传祥同志的共同生活中，使我深深感到：一个文艺工作者，必须首先解决自己的世界观问题，必须把自己的立足点移到工农兵这方面来，才能和工农兵有共同的感情、共同的语言，才能对生活有敏锐的感受能力。有一回我和时传祥同志一起乘公共汽车，他很快就觉察到一位青年妇女有病，马上起来让座。我当时想，为什么五十多岁的时传祥同志的目光比我还敏锐呢？这是他时刻关心别人，处处想到别人的缘故。他并没有向我讲什么大道理，但是他的行动却是更有说服力的教育。如果我们真正学好毛主席著作，象时传祥同志那样，带着阶级感情来观察生活，象他那样热爱党，热情地关心群众生活，那么，我们就能发掘共产主义的伟大主题和英雄人物的高尚的精神世界，使自己的作品更好地为人民服务，鼓舞人民前进。
    时传祥自豪地说：“我已经掏了三十多年的大粪，为了党的事业，我愿再掏三十年”。在青年班生活了四个月，是我难忘的一课，使我认识到，时传祥同志和青年工人们正是我们时代的平凡而伟大的英雄。使我懂得了一个真理：一个人能力有大小，但只要有毫不利己专门利人的精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。这样的人，正是我们学习的榜样，也正是我们文艺应该表现和歌颂的对象。
    我们下定决心，要把在青年班生活的感受用画笔画出来。大粪、掏粪工人，在过去一般是认为不能入画的。在和工人的共同劳动中，我们的感情有了变化。深深感到画这样的画是我们的政治责任，这是为我们时代的闪闪发光的英雄人物立象！
    但是，时传祥和青年班的动人事迹很多，从何画起呢？四个月来那些激励过我们、教育过我们的生活画面，一个一个涌现在眼前，再不象从前那样闭户静坐、苦思苦想而找不到创作题材了，现在是如何更集中、更概括、更好地去表现的问题。在领导和同志们帮助下，确定了主题，决定采用组画的形式，反映时传祥和青年班的革命精神面貌。这次参加华北地区年画版画展览的《培养革命精神的课堂》、《水热心暖》、《传艰苦朴素的作风》、《当了人民代表》，便是组画中的四幅。
    《培养革命精神的课堂》反映的是各行各业的人们到青年班参加劳动的情景，以表现人们对平凡的劳动的热爱和尊重，宣传一切工作都是为了革命的思想。画面上画上了民警、大学生、解放军、机关干部和时传祥一起背粪。为什么我们把民警放在显眼的地位呢？因为我们不止一次听到掏粪老工人诉苦说，在旧社会，警察打骂掏粪工人是家常便饭。时传祥有一次在街上洒了粪，警察过来抽了他三警棍，隔棉衣把身上打出了三条血印。他挨打后不想干了，可是在那暗无天日的旧社会，连不干的自由也没有，粪霸又勾结警察毒打他。因此，新社会的民警同志来参加背粪，格外使工人们感动。所以，我在构图的时候，就毫不犹豫地把人民警察摆在比较主要的位置。
    《水热心暖》是表现人民群众对掏粪工人的热爱和尊重。在旧社会，掏粪工人是不被尊重的，时传祥同志常向人讲起一桩痛心的往事：解放前他到一个律师家掏粪，天热口渴，想要点儿水喝，那个律师怕脏了他们家的水舀子，叫老妈子用喂猫的碗舀了点水给他。如今呢，我们劳动时经常遇到老大娘和红领巾送茶送水，下雨送草帽。时传祥本人一提起这些事就非常感动。他一再说：“这是党和毛主席教导得好啊！”我一直在想，象送水这样的事见得多了，我便视为平淡；时传祥却总是很激动，而且每次都想到党和毛主席的教导。这正是他永不忘阶级苦，永不忘本，热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱新社会，永葆革命热情的具体表现。我们就带着这种认识画了这幅画。
    这次我们虽然没有带速写本下去，但是，在创作构思时，时传祥和青年工人的形象却活生生的在我们脑子里出现。我想，这正是我们遵照毛主席的教导所尝到的最初的甜头。当然，这四幅画还远远不能概括时传祥同志和青年班的精神面貌。我们准备听取各方面的意见，继续加工提高。
    在创作组画期间，我们对“三结合”的创作方式有了较深的体会。在创作过程中，领导同志反复给我们指出：要突出政治，要刻画好英雄形象，要有生活气息，不断地为我们端正方向，提高认识。以前画画，画出初稿只给同行几个人看看就行了，现在认识到画画既然是为工农兵群众，就必须拜工农兵群众为老师，虚心倾听他们的意见。我们不止一次地带上画，到清洁队去征求意见。
    《培养革命精神的课堂》这幅画的草稿后边有三个掏粪的人比较呆板，清洁队的领导同志说：“把他们画得昂首阔步的才带劲！”《当了人民代表》这幅画，改画时曾想表现时传祥和代表们正向人民大会堂里走，背景画两个柱基。但是工人们一致认为画面上应表现人民大会堂的正面全貌，他们说这才“有气派”。后来我们遵照这些意见改了。
    回忆自己过去的创作所以成绩不大，最根本的原因就在于自己的世界观没有得到改造，没有跟工农兵结合，正象毛主席教导我们的：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”无论自己的思想感情，还是艺术趣味，都得在向工农兵群众学习中彻底改造，才能创作出为工农兵所需要、所欢迎的作品。（附图片）
