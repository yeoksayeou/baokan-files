	Just Out of Reach
	In order to lure American youth to South Vietnam as cannon fodder, and to try to stimulate the flagging morale of the invading American troops, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a "Soldiers' Rights Act," stipulating that soldiers participating in the Vietnam War would receive preferential treatment in employment, education, housing, and medical care after their discharge.
	This can be said to be "imperial grace." However, with the increasing number of casualties among the invading American troops in Vietnam, no American soldier sent to the South Vietnam battlefield knows when he will lose his life. Isn't the hope of enjoying this "preferential treatment" too slim for them?

    可望不可即
    为了诱骗美国青年去南越充当炮灰，并企图刺激侵越美军涣散的士气，美国众议院通过一项“士兵权利法”，规定参加侵越战争的士兵退伍后，在就业、求学、住房和医疗方面可得到优待。
    这可以说是“皇恩浩荡”了。但是，在侵越美军伤亡日益激增的情况下，被送到南越战场上去的美国士兵谁都不晓得哪一天就会丧命，对他们来说享受这种“优待”的希望不是太渺茫了吗？
