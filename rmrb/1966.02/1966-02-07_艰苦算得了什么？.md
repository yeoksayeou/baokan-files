      The following short articles are selected from wall posters from the 1202 Drilling Team of Daqing Oilfield over the past few years. The 1202 Drilling Team is one of the advanced units of Daqing Oilfield and is known as the "Ever-Sharp Blade." Although these wall poster contributions reflect only snippets of the team's work and life, we can see the spirit of Daqing people in their hard work, meticulous precision, and unwavering accuracy, as well as their thrift, diligence, unity, and friendship in their daily lives. Comrade Mao Zedong, in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, called on our literary specialists to pay attention to the wall posters of the masses. The articles published here are written by workers and grassroots cadres. They write about themselves with a strong sense of life, and the content is revolutionary and socialist, while the writing style is simple, vivid, and direct. This is something we should learn from.

    Heroes Fear No Wind and Snow
    What year was 1960? It was the most severe year of the three years of natural disasters, and it was the year that modern revisionists exerted pressure on our country. However, the Chinese people are full of heroic spirit "letting the swirling clouds fly past, still taking it easy." It was in this year that the people of Daqing marched into the prairie and fought for oil. At that time, although the conditions were so difficult and the grasslands were so cold, the people of Daqing regarded all of this as commonplace. They said:
    What does hardship count for?
    Driller Zhang Shengfu
    In April 1960, our team arrived in Daqing. Daqing was still desolate at that time. Residents were scattered across the prairie, and there were few houses. We lived in a stable of a local livestock farm. This stable was short, damp, had doors but no windows, and had not been used to tether horses for a long time. Part of the roof had collapsed, and the walls had holes here and there. The corners of the room were covered with cobwebs, very dilapidated. We borrowed brooms and shovels from the commune. We swept away the dust while chatting and laughing. Everyone worked together to clean the house and spread some hay on the ground, solving the problem of bedding.
    Whether it was a cowshed or a stable, everyone cleaned the rooms neatly and tidily. Then, they chose the highest and brightest place on the wall to put up a portrait of Chairman Mao. The empty spaces were then filled with slogans, red and green, which were inspiring to look at.
    Before long, the rainy season came. The rain here was heavy and abundant. When it rained, the house would be filled with the sound of dripping. The water on the ground was ankle-deep, and the rainwater that leaked was blackish-red, just like soy sauce. Comrades put basins and teacups on the bedding, and soon they would fill a tank. Captain Ma Deren, despite being sick for three days, asked everyone to move the cement used for cementing into the house to prevent the torrential rain from wetting it, and moved his own bed from the house to the doorway, not sleeping all night.
      (Editor's Note: Over the years, there have been many changes in the personnel of the 1202 Drilling Team, so on this page, the captain has changed several times, and the same person is sometimes a worker and sometimes a cadre. This is for clarification.)
    During the rainy season, the roads were muddy, and trucks delivering fuel and spare parts could not reach the well site, so the comrades carried them themselves. And they put forward
  the bold slogan of "Work hard in light rain, work harder in light rain, and make one day equal to two days in sunny weather." In summer, the sun was scorching, and mosquitoes and gadflies swarmed; in winter, they insisted on operating in the severe cold of minus forty degrees Celsius. But hardship did not scare everyone. Comrade Li Jiliang, the driller, spoke our minds: "Difficult conditions are a good opportunity to train us. The harder it is, the stronger we become, and the harder it is, the more glorious it is." Some people even wrote heroic poems like "Learn from the Red Army crossing the snow-capped mountains, heroes fear no wind and snow."
    In this way, in the difficult environment of the early stage of the battle, we overcame numerous difficulties. The more we fought, the stronger we became!

### 艰苦算得了什么？

专栏：

      这里发表的几篇短文，是从大庆油田一二○二钻井队几年来的墙报稿件中挑选出来的。一二○二钻井队，是大庆油田先进单位之一，被誉为“永不卷刃的尖刀”。这些墙报稿，反映的虽然只是一个队的工作和生活的一些片断，但我们可以通过它们，看到大庆人工作上艰苦奋斗、严细准狠，生活上勤俭节约、团结友爱的精神面貌。毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中，号召我们的文学专门家应该注意群众的墙报。这里发表的文章，出自工人和基层干部的手笔，他们自己写自己，有着浓厚的生活气息，内容是革命的、社会主义的，文风是朴素、生动、干脆的。这一点很值得我们学习。

    英雄何惧风雪寒
    一九六○年是什么年？是三年自然灾害最严重的一年，是现代修正主义者对我国施加压力的一年。可是，中国人民有的是英雄气概“乱云飞渡仍从容”，大庆人就在这一年，向草原进军，为油而战。那时，尽管条件是那样艰难，草原是那样天寒地冻，大庆人却把这一切，一概等闲视之。他们说：
    艰苦算得了什么？
    司钻　张生福
    一九六○年四月，我们队来到了大庆。那时的大庆还是荒凉的。草原上居民分散，房屋也少。我们就住在当地一个畜牧场的马厩里。这座马厩又矮、又潮，有门没窗，很久没拴过马了。部分屋顶塌了，墙也东一个洞西一个眼的。屋角里挂满了蜘蛛网，破旧得很。我们向公社借来了扫帚、铁锨。一边扫尘土，一边有说有笑。大家七手八脚地把房子打扫干净，抱些马草，在地上一铺，床铺就解决了。
    不管牛棚也好，马厩也罢，大家把屋子收拾得干干净净，整整齐齐。然后在墙上选一块最高、最光亮的地方，把毛主席的画象贴上。空的地方再贴些标语，红红绿绿，看了令人振奋。
    没过多久，雨季来了。这里的雨，又多又大，一下起来，屋子里到处嘀嘀嗒嗒地响。地上的水齐脚面深，漏下来的雨水都是黑红色的，和酱油一个样。同志们把脸盆、茶缸放在铺上，一会儿就接一缸子。队长马德仁尽管病了三天，为了不让暴雨把固井用的水泥淋湿，叫大家把水泥搬到屋里，而把自己的床铺从屋子里移到门口，一夜没有睡。
      （编者附注：几年来，一二○二钻井队的人事已有不少变动，所以在这个版上，队长变了好几个人，而同一个人一会儿是工人，一会儿又变成干部了。特此说明。）
    雨季里，道路泥泞，送油料、配件的汽车开不到井场，同志们就自己去抬。并且提出
  “大雨小干，小雨大干，晴天一天当两天”的豪迈口号。夏季烈日当头，蚊虻成群；冬季在零下四十几度的严寒里坚持操作。但艰苦并没有吓倒大家。司钻李继良同志说出了我们的心里话：“条件艰苦，正是锻炼我们的好机会。越艰苦，锻炼得越坚强，越艰苦才越光荣。”有人还写出“要学红军过雪山，英雄何惧风雪寒”那样充满了英雄气概的诗句。
    就这样，我们在会战初期的艰苦环境里，战胜了重重艰难困苦。我们越战越顽强！
