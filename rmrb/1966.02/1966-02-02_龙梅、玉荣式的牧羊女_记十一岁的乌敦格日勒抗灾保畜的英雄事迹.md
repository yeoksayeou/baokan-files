    A shepherd girl of Mongolian nationality, Wudun Gerile, eleven years old, from the Ordos grassland in western Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, bravely fought against blizzards and severe cold for fifteen hours not long ago, protecting the commune's flock of sheep. Her heroic behavior has been praised by the local Party and government, and people commend her as a little hero of disaster resistance and animal protection like Long Mei and Yu Rong.
    Wudun Gerile's home is in the Hongguang Brigade of the Xinzhao Commune in Otog Banner, Ik Zhao League. At dawn on December 22, 1965, she left her mother and drove the flock of sheep out to graze, at which time the weather was clear. Because she wanted to find a good pasture, she drove the flock a bit further. At about 3:00 p.m., as she was preparing to return to the settlement, the climate of the Ordos Plateau suddenly changed, and a strong wind blew, with flying sand and stones, turning the grassland into a dim, yellow world. The flock was startled by the rare Force 8 gale, and the two hundred and ten sheep and goats frantically ran southwest with the wind. Wudun Gerile bravely rushed over, blocking them from the left and right, and gathered the scattered sheep together. The direction home was against the wind, and as she guided the flock to turn around, waves of violent sandstorms pressed against them, forcing the flock to turn around again and run wildly with the wind. It was impossible to drive the sheep home against the wind, so Wudun Gerile closely followed the flock, trying her best to block them, not allowing any to get lost. About two hours later, taking advantage of a slight weakening of the wind, she once again turned the direction of the flock, hoping to return safely to the settlement before the blizzard returned. Unexpectedly, just two li from home, when the houses of the settlement were already visible, the gale rose again, and the flock quickly ran southwest with the wind. At this critical moment, Wudun Gerile did not run home, but still did not leave the collective flock of sheep.
    That night, the temperature on the Ordos grassland dropped to minus 30 degrees Celsius. In the pitch-black night where nothing could be seen, the heroic shepherd girl braved the biting cold, endured extreme fatigue and hunger, and stubbornly followed the flock in the storm. Late at night, even the white shadows of the sheep in front could not be seen clearly, so she ran and shouted. She didn't know when the flock had left her side, and even when her throat was hoarse, she couldn't hear a single bleat or touch a single sheep. After about fifteen hours of fighting against the storm and severe cold, she was exhausted. Near dawn, the little girl fell dizzy on the grassland and fell asleep in the sound of the wind.
    After dawn, the wind stopped. Wudun Gerile was awakened by the cold, and she immediately thought of the lost flock. She raised her numb legs, endured the frostbite, and walked laboriously, continuing to look for the flock. After walking more than a li, she met Ma Baozi, a Han Chinese herdsman living nearby. Seeing that she had encountered an accident, Ma Baozi quickly carried her into his home, and he and his wife gave her hot tea, food, and wine, and also treated her frostbite. As soon as Wudun Gerile regained some energy, she wanted to continue looking for the flock, but her feet were already frostbitten and she could not walk. After Ma Baozi learned about her struggle against the storm and severe cold, he immediately ran to discuss the matter with Dander, a nearby Mongolian herdsman, and sent the little girl to the hospital for rescue.
    While Wudun Gerile was guarding the flock in the storm all night, many local cadres and commune members, including Han Chinese farmers who came to the pastoral area to help dig wells, also divided into several groups and braved the strong wind and severe cold to search the grassland for the shepherd girl and her flock. Until dawn, neither the person nor the sheep were found. Just as Wudun Gerile's mother and everyone were anxious and uneasy, Ma Baozi rushed over to tell people that the little girl had been sent to the commune health center, and the lost flock had also been found. Only one of the two hundred and ten sheep had been frozen to death, and three were missing.
    On the evening of December 23, the Otog Banner Party Committee and the Banner People's Committee sent a car to take Wudun Gerile to the Banner Hospital for treatment. During the treatment, the Deputy Director of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Animal Husbandry Department, who was in the area, and the Party and government leaders of Ik Zhao League and Otog Banner, all went to the hospital to express their condolences to her.
    During her convalescence, Wudun Gerile was very concerned about her flock of sheep. She said to those who came to visit her: "I don't miss home, I just miss my flock of sheep." When the team cadre told her that the flock had been found, she seemed very happy.
    With the careful treatment of the Banner Hospital and the cordial care from all sides, Wudun Gerile's frostbite has been completely cured. Her mother, Aomin, saw that her daughter had recovered her health, and tears of excitement flowed from her eyes, repeatedly expressing her gratitude to the Party and the government for their care for her daughter.
    Wudun Gerile's parents worked as herders for the herdboss before liberation and were destitute. After liberation, their family's life gradually improved. Clever and bright, Wudun Gerile often helped her family herd sheep and deliver lambs from the age of six or seven. After her father passed away, because there were many younger siblings in the family, she often helped her mother graze the sheep, managing the flock very well, and constantly received rewards from the production team. In the production team, she often liked to listen to people read articles by Chairman Mao such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Her older brother also told her some of the principles of herding for the revolution. These all left a deep impression on her. She loved the collective flock of sheep more and more and cared more and more about public interests. She has repeatedly helped neighboring herders find lost lambs, and the surrounding commune members all praised her as a good child of the new society.
    The Otog Banner Committee of the Communist Party of China recently called on cadres, farmers, and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the banner to learn from Wudun Gerile's collectivist ideology of loving the people's commune, not fearing difficulties, being selfless for the public good, and wholeheartedly protecting collective property. The Otog Banner Committee of the Communist Youth League has admitted Wudun Gerile into the Chinese Young Pioneers.

    龙梅、玉荣式的牧羊女
    ——记十一岁的乌敦格日勒抗灾保畜的英雄事迹
    内蒙古自治区西部鄂尔多斯草原上一位十一岁的蒙古族牧羊女乌敦格日勒，不久前在暴风严寒中英勇搏斗十五个小时，保护公社的羊群。她的英勇行为受到了当地党和政府的表扬，人们称赞她是龙梅、玉荣式的抗灾保畜小英雄。
    乌敦格日勒家在伊克昭盟鄂托克旗新召公社红光大队。一九六五年十二月二十二日黎明，她离开了母亲赶着羊群出外放牧，当时天气晴朗。因为要找好草场，她赶着羊群多走了些路。下午三时许她正准备回定居地，鄂尔多斯高原气候突然变化，狂风大作，飞沙走石，草原顿时成了昏黄世界。羊群被罕见的八级大风惊动了，二百一十只绵羊和山羊，顺风向西南拼命奔跑。乌敦格日勒勇敢地飞奔过去，左拦右堵，把跑散了的羊只赶在一起。回家的方向是顶风，她引导羊群刚转过头，一阵阵狂暴的风沙迎面压来，逼迫羊群又转过头顺风乱跑。顶风赶羊回家已不可能，乌敦格日勒就紧紧追随羊群奔走，尽力拦堵，不让羊只失散。大约两小时后，她趁风势稍见减弱，又再次扭转羊群前进的方向，希望能在暴风再起之前安全返回定居地。不料在离家只有二里路、已经可以看到定居地房屋的时候，狂风又起，羊群随风回头往西南方向迅速奔跑。在这关头，乌敦格日勒没有奔回家去，仍旧一步也不离开集体的羊群。
    当天晚上，鄂尔多斯草原的气温降到摄氏零下三十度。英雄的牧羊女在伸手不见五指的黑夜中，冒着刺骨的寒冷，忍受着极度的疲劳和饥饿，仍然在狂风中倔强地跟着羊群奔走。夜深了，连前面白色的羊影子也看不清了，她就一边奔走一边喊叫。羊群不知什么时候已不在她身边，她嗓子喊哑了也听不到一声羊叫，碰不到一只羊。经过同暴风严寒大约十五个小时的搏斗，她已精疲力竭。快到黎明时，这小姑娘昏昏沉沉地倒在草原上，在风声中睡熟了。
    天亮后，风停了。乌敦格日勒被冻醒过来，她立即想起丢失了的羊群。她抬起麻木的腿，忍着冻伤，吃力地走着，继续寻找羊群。走出一里多路，她遇到了住在附近的汉族牧民马保子。马保子看她遭到了意外，赶忙把她抱进自己家里，同妻子一起给她喝热茶、吃饭、灌酒，还给她治疗冻伤。乌敦格日勒刚有了点精神，就要去继续寻找羊群，但她的两脚已经冻伤不能行走。马保子了解她同暴风严寒搏斗的经过后，立即跑去找邻近的蒙古族牧民丹德尔商量，把小姑娘送到医院去抢救。
    当乌敦格日勒彻夜在风暴中护卫羊群的时候，当地许多干部、社员，包括前来牧区帮助打井的汉族农民，也分成几个小组，冒着疾风酷寒在草原上寻找着这个牧羊女和她的羊群。直到天亮，人和羊都没有找到，正当乌敦格日勒的母亲和大家焦急不安的时候，马保子赶来告诉人们小姑娘已被送往公社卫生院，失散的羊群也已找到，二百一十只羊只冻死一只，失踪三只。
    十二月二十三日晚上，鄂托克旗党委和旗人民委员会派出汽车把乌敦格日勒接到旗医院治疗。治疗期间，正在当地的内蒙古自治区畜牧厅副厅长和伊克昭盟和鄂托克旗的党政领导干部都到医院向她进行慰问。
    乌敦格日勒在养伤期间还十分惦念她的羊群，她对前去慰问的人说：“我不想家，就是想我的羊群。”当队干部告诉她羊群已经找到的时候，她显得非常高兴。
    在旗医院的悉心治疗和各方面的亲切照料下，乌敦格日勒的冻伤已经完全治愈。她的母亲敖敏看到女儿恢复健康，激动得流出了热泪，一再表示感谢党和政府对她女儿的关怀。
    乌敦格日勒的父母亲解放前给牧主当牧工，一贫如洗。解放后，他们家的生活才逐渐改善。聪敏灵巧的乌敦格日勒从六、七岁起就经常帮助家里牧羊、接羔。父亲去世后，因为家里弟妹多，她就经常帮助妈妈放牧，把羊群管理得很好，不断获得生产队的奖励。在生产队里，她常喜欢听人念讲毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章。哥哥也给她讲一些为革命放牧的道理。这些都给她留下了深刻的印象。她越来越爱护集体的羊群，越来越关心公共利益。她曾多次帮助邻近牧民寻找丢失的羊羔，周围的社员都称赞她是新社会的好孩子。
    中共鄂托克旗委员会最近号召全旗各民族干部、农牧民学习乌敦格日勒热爱人民公社、不怕困难、舍己为公、一心一意保护集体财产的集体主义思想。共青团鄂托克旗委员会已吸收乌敦格日勒加入中国少年先锋队。　　　　　　　（据新华社讯）
