　　Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, February 26th: While suffering a disastrous defeat in its large-scale "mopping up" operations against the central coastal Binh Dinh and Phu Yen provinces of South Vietnam, the American invading forces have been continuously attacked by the Liberation Army in the provinces north of this region, including Quang Tri, Thua Thien, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai, leaving them unable to attend to both head and tail, suffering heavy losses, and in a state of utter disarray.
    According to Western news agencies, from Quang Tri City in the northernmost province of South Vietnam south along Highway 1, the Liberation Army has recently launched continuous offensives against the periphery of important US-puppet military bases in Quang Tri City, Hue, Da Nang, Chu Lai, and Quang Ngai City, killing and wounding many enemies. According to UPI, since the Liberation Army of Quang Tri Province shelled the Chao Phong puppet military district headquarters near the 17th parallel on the 22nd, it has recently launched "at least one attack every day" against enemy strongholds in Quang Tri Province. On the morning of the 25th, the Liberation Army simultaneously attacked a command post of the US Marine Corps six kilometers west of Phu Bai and two puppet military strongholds northeast of Chao Phong, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. A US Marine Corps jet fighter-bomber attempting to provide support was shot down by the Liberation Army's intense ground fire.
    According to reports, in the Hue area, the Liberation Army has been launching continuous offensives from the 22nd to the 26th, and fierce fighting has been ongoing. On the morning of the 22nd, the Liberation Army attacked a puppet military stronghold about 16 kilometers west of Hue, inflicting heavy casualties on the puppet People's Self-Defense Forces guarding this stronghold. The enemy dispatched two battalions of approximately seven hundred troops to provide reinforcement, but this reinforcement force was ambushed by the Liberation Army en route, suffering numerous casualties.
    According to reports, the US Marine Corps, which suffered a disastrous defeat in the so-called "Operation Double Eagle," launched the so-called "second phase" of "Operation Double Eagle" in Tri Ky City, south of Da Nang, starting from the 20th, but suffered the same fate. Not only could they not "capture" the Liberation Army, but they were also constantly being hit. The Liberation Army also took advantage of the emptiness of the Marine Corps' lair to continuously attack the defending enemies in Da Nang. On the 23rd, the Liberation Army grabbed a patrol team in Da Nang's outer circle and gave them a sound thrashing. On the 24th, the Liberation Army attacked two companies of the Marine Corps again, killing and wounding many enemies.
    According to reports, on the morning of the 26th, the Liberation Army attacked a US Marine Corps stronghold only a few kilometers from Chu Lai. They first bombarded it with intense artillery fire for more than an hour, then launched an assault, quickly breaking through the enemy's three outer defense lines, entering the inner defensive circle, and charging towards the enemy's barracks and tents. They engaged the enemy in close combat, using hand grenades and light weapons to fiercely strike the American devils, leaving the enemy disoriented and chaotic, and many enemies died on the spot.
    Enemy strongholds on the outskirts of Quang Ngai City have also been constantly attacked by the Liberation Army in recent days. According to reports, on the 24th, the Liberation Army simultaneously attacked four enemy strongholds in Son Ha district, 30 kilometers southwest of Quang Ngai City, killing and wounding many enemies. The day before, the Liberation Army also attacked four armed special agent groups engaged in "pacification" activities about eight kilometers southwest of Quang Ngai City, giving many enemies the punishment they deserved.
    According to a UPI report on the 25th, a unit of the US 1st Cavalry Division engaged in "mopping up" operations in the Bong Son area was fiercely attacked by the Liberation Army about 12 kilometers south of Bong Son on the 23rd. After more than two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and "had to withdraw from the defensive circle."

　　粉碎美军在中部沿海地区“钳形攻势”后乘胜出击再显神威
　　南越解放军又在四省打得美军首尾难顾损失惨重
    新华社二十六日讯　西贡消息：美国侵略军在对南越中部中区沿海平定、富安省进行大规模“扫荡”惨遭失败的同时，又在这个地区以北的广治、承天、广南、广义等省连续遭受解放军的打击，首尾不能兼顾，损失惨重，狼狈不堪。
    据西方通讯社报道，从南越最北的广治省的广治市沿一号公路向南，解放军最近一周来对广治市、顺化、岘港、朱莱、广义市等美伪军重要基地外围连续发动进攻，杀伤许多敌人。据合众国际社报道，广治省解放军从二十二日炮轰十七度线附近的潮丰伪军县总部以来，最近向广治省敌军据点“至少每天要发动一次进攻”。二十五日清晨，解放军同时进攻了芙拜西面六公里美国海军陆战队的一个指挥所和潮丰东北的两个伪军据点，使敌人遭到很大伤亡。一架企图支援的美国海军陆战队喷气式战斗轰炸机被解放军猛烈的地面炮火击落。
    据报道，在顺化一带，从二十二日到二十六日解放军不断发动进攻，激战一直在进行。二十二日上午，解放军攻打顺化以西约十六公里的一个伪军据点，使守卫这个据点的伪民卫队遭到惨重伤亡。敌人出动两个营约七百人的兵力前去援救，但这支增援部队在途中又遭到解放军伏击，伤亡累累。
    据报道，在所谓“双鹰攻势”中遭到惨败的美国海军陆战队，从二十日起又在岘港南面的三岐市发动了“双鹰攻势”的所谓“第二阶段”，但同样遭到了失败。他们不但“捕捉”不到解放军，反而不断挨打。解放军还趁海军陆战队老巢空虚之际，不断打击岘港的守敌。二十三日，解放军在岘港外圈揪住了一支巡逻队，猛揍一顿。二十四日，解放军又袭击了海军陆战队的两个连，打死、打伤不少敌人。
    据报道，二十六日清晨，解放军进攻了离朱莱仅数公里的一个美国海军陆战队据点。他们首先用猛烈的炮火进行一个多小时的轰击，接着发起冲锋，迅速地突破了敌军的三道外围防线，进入内层防御圈，冲向敌军的营房和帐篷，同敌人展开近战，用手榴弹和轻武器痛击美国鬼子，打得敌人蒙头转向，乱成一片，许多敌人当即丧命。
    广义市外围的敌军据点，最近几天也不断遭到解放军的袭击。据报道，二十四日，解放军同时进攻了广义市西南三十公里山河县的四个敌军据点，打死、打伤不少敌人。在这前一天，解放军还在广义市西南约八公里处袭击了在那一带搞“绥靖”活动的四个武装特务小组，使不少敌人得到了应得的惩罚。
    据合众国际社二十五日报道，在蓬山一带进行“扫荡”的美国骑兵第一师的一支部队，二十三日在蓬山以南约十二公里处遭到解放军的猛烈进攻。经过两个多小时的激战，敌军遭到很大伤亡，“不得不从防御圈后撤”。
