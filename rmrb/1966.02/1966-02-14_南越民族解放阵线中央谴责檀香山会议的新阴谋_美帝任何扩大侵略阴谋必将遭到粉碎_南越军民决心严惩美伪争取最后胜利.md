    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 12th (via Vietnam News Agency): The Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front issued a statement on February 11th condemning the new conspiracy of aggression plotted by the United States at the recent Honolulu Conference. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    The Johnson clique recently summoned their Saigon stooges, the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky gang, to Honolulu, where they staged an ugly farce of a meeting, issuing a joint "declaration" and "joint communique." As everyone knows, the U.S. war of aggression in South Vietnam has been strongly condemned by the people of the world, including the American people, and its "peace offensive" has been exposed and suffered a shameful defeat. The patriotic and just struggle of the South Vietnamese people has received widespread sympathy and support on all five continents, and the prestige and role of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on the international stage is growing day by day. The people of the world are increasingly widely recognizing the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the sole genuine representative of the 14 million people of South Vietnam, while the puppet regime established by the United States in Saigon is disintegrating and decaying, to the point that everyone hates and abandons it. It is in this situation that U.S. imperialism has had to stage the Honolulu Conference, attempting to use it to cope with international public opinion and create a legal basis for intensifying and expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    From this conference, people can clearly see that the United States is attempting to clothe their Saigon lackeys in a garment of "nationalism" and "independence," and to clamorously announce the "obligations" they have undertaken for their lackeys, in order to use their lackeys as a cover to more ferociously attack the revolutionary movement of the South Vietnamese people. However, this trick has been played again and again for eleven years—from the Ngo Dinh Diem-Ngo Dinh Nhu brothers' period to the current Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky gang—and is not new to anyone. No matter how the United States paints the South Vietnamese puppet regime, it cannot conceal the regime's traitorous and subservient nature. It is a regime established by the United States, which can only survive mainly on American weapons and dollars, and which the United States has repeatedly replaced thirteen times through coups d'état in the past eleven years. U.S. imperialism directly determines everything in South Vietnam, from strategy and tactics to the plans for each military operation, and even the fate of their stooges.

    The words in the Honolulu "joint communique" only confirm the aggressive intentions of U.S. imperialism and the traitorous determination of their stooges.

    In order to "win" the "hearts and minds" of the South Vietnamese people, U.S. imperialism ordered the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky group at the Honolulu Conference to promote their "rural construction plan." In reality, this is just a replica of the old "pacification" plans formulated by Collins, Staley, Taylor, McNamara, and Nguyen Khanh in the past, the purpose of which is to turn the entire South Vietnam into a large prison; to create conditions for U.S. imperialism to plunder the wealth of South Vietnam and loot more manpower and material resources to meet the needs of its war of aggression, and to pave the way for sending more U.S. expeditionary forces to oppose the South Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation struggle.

    People have long seen that it is U.S. imperialism that has invaded South Vietnam, and it is U.S. imperialism that is the source of tension in Indochina and Southeast Asia. However, they brazenly claimed again at the Honolulu Conference that sending hundreds of thousands of American troops to South Vietnam was to fulfill America's "obligations" and "stop" North Vietnam's "aggression" against South Vietnam, claiming that they respect the Geneva Accords and do not seek any bases, any colonial rule, or any alliances. This is truly extremely shameless and clumsy slander and deception. If U.S. imperialism really wants to fulfill their "obligations," why do they not abide by the guarantee they made at the 1954 Geneva Conference that the United States "will not use threat or force to disturb" the Geneva Accords? The United States says it does not seek any bases... or any alliances. Then why did it establish the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, an aggressive bloc, arbitrarily placing South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia under the protection of this alliance, and trying every possible means to pull these Indochinese countries into their Southeast Asian military system? As for the so-called Vietnamese "aggression" against Vietnam, that is the most foolish myth created by U.S. imperialism to cover up its despicable aggressiveness in Vietnam. The foreign troops now stationed in South Vietnam are precisely the expeditionary forces of the United States and its lackeys. The United States says it respects the South Vietnamese people's right to self-determination, then why does it not recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front and its program? The program of the National Liberation Front most fully reflects the urgent aspirations of the 14 million South Vietnamese people, namely, independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and then the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    There is no doubt that the results of the Honolulu Conference clearly show the extremely stubborn attempt of U.S. imperialism and the South Vietnamese traitors to remain in South Vietnam and prepare to further strengthen and expand the aggression against South Vietnam. Their cries of "persistently seeking peace" are nothing more than a smokescreen to cover up their intensified efforts to send more troops and weapons to South Vietnam; to use extremely barbarous means of warfare such as B-52 strategic bombers, poisons, and toxic gases, and to implement the "scorched earth policy" of "kill all, burn all, destroy all" on a larger scale in South Vietnam; to intensify the bombing of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; to escalate the war in Laos, and to intensify provocative attacks against Cambodia.

    In the name of the 14 million South Vietnamese people, the South Vietnam National Liberation Front strongly condemns the conspiracies plotted by U.S. imperialism and the Saigon puppet regime at the Honolulu Conference. The South Vietnam National Liberation Front urgently calls on the governments, organizations, individuals, and peoples of all countries to condemn the U.S. imperialists, stop their bloody hands in South Vietnam, and take more forceful measures to support the South Vietnamese people's just and patriotic struggle. The Honolulu Conference has demonstrated the stubbornness and recklessness of U.S. imperialism. However, U.S. imperialists are suffering heavy defeats militarily and politically. No matter how much effort they exert and what cunning means they adopt, their plot to invade South Vietnam will undoubtedly be crushed.

    The South Vietnamese people have united in the past eleven years to resist U.S. aggression and save the country, and have achieved brilliant victories. They will continue to heighten their vigilance, strengthen their unity, and, with firm determination, fully display their patriotism and fully show their hatred of the enemy, give U.S. imperialism and the traitors more severe blows, defeat their war of aggression, and win final victory.

    南越民族解放阵线中央谴责檀香山会议的新阴谋
    美帝任何扩大侵略阴谋必将遭到粉碎
    南越军民决心严惩美伪争取最后胜利
    新华社河内十二日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会十一日就美国最近召开檀香山会议策划新的侵略阴谋发表声明。声明全文如下：
    约翰逊集团最近把他们的西贡奴才阮文绍—阮高其匪帮召到檀香山，在那里上演了一出开会的丑剧，发表了一个共同“宣言”和“联合公报”。谁都知道，美国在越南南方的侵略战争受到了全世界人民包括美国人民的强烈谴责，它的“和平攻势”被揭穿，遭到了可耻的失败。越南南方人民的爱国正义斗争在所有五大洲得到了广泛的同情和支持，越南南方民族解放阵线在国际舞台上的声望和作用一天天在增长。全世界人民越来越广泛地承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方一千四百万人民的唯一的真正代表，而美国在西贡建立的傀儡政权却在瓦解和腐烂，以致人人都讨厌和弃绝它。正是在这样的情况下，美帝国主义不得不演出檀香山会议，企图以此来应付各国的舆论，为加紧和扩大侵略越南的战争制造法律根据。
    人们从这次会议中可以清楚地看到，美国企图给他们的西贡走狗披上一件“民族主义”和“独立”的外衣，并且喧嚣地宣布对他们的奴才承担的“义务”，以便利用他们的奴才做掩护，更凶恶地进攻越南南方人民的革命运动。但是，十一年来——从吴庭艳—吴庭儒兄弟时期到目前阮文绍—阮高其匪帮时期——这种花招已经再三玩弄过了，对任何人都不新奇了。不管美国怎样给南越傀儡政权涂脂抹粉，也掩盖不住这个政权的奴才卖国性质，这是一个美国建立的政权，主要靠了美国的武器和美元才能活命，而美国在过去十一年中一再用政变把它更换了十三次。美帝国主义直接决定着南越的每一件事，从战略、战术到每一次军事行动的计划，甚至他们的走狗的命运。
    檀香山“联合公报”中的话只是证实了美帝国主义的侵略意图和他们的走狗的卖国决心。
    为了“争取”越南南方人民的“民心”，美帝国主义在檀香山会议上命令阮文绍—阮高其集团宣扬他们的“乡村建设计划”，实际上，这不过是柯林斯、斯特利、泰勒、麦克纳马拉和阮庆过去制定的老一套“绥靖”计划的翻版，其目的是要把整个越南南方变成一个大监狱；创造条件让美帝国主义抢掠越南南方的财富和掠夺更多的人力物力来满足其侵略战争的需要，并为增派美国远征军来反对越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争铺平道路。
    人们早就看到，正是美帝国主义侵略了越南南方，正是美帝国主义是印度支那和东南亚紧张局势的根源，但是，他们竟然再次在檀香山会议上无耻地声称，派遣几十万美军到越南南方是为了履行美国的“义务”和“制止”越南北方对越南南方的“侵略”，声称他们尊重日内瓦协议，不谋求任何基地，任何殖民统治或任何联盟。这真是极其无耻和笨拙的污蔑和欺骗。如果美帝国主义真的要履行他们的“义务”，他们为什么不遵守他们在一九五四年日内瓦会议上作出的保证，即美国“将不使用威胁或武力去妨害”日内瓦协议呢？美国说，它不谋求任何基地……或任何联盟。那末，它为什么成立东南亚条约组织这一侵略集团，专横地把越南南方、老挝和柬埔寨置于这一联盟的保护之下，并且千方百计地要把这些印度支那国家拉入他们的东南亚军事体系之内呢？至于所谓越南人“侵略”越南的说法，那是美帝国主义为了掩饰它在越南表现出来的卑鄙的侵略性而制造出来的最愚蠢不过的神话。现在驻在越南南方的外国军队，正是美国及其仆从的远征军，美国说，它尊重越南南方人民的自决权，那末，它为什么不承认越南南方民族解放阵线和它的纲领呢？民族解放阵线的纲领最充分地反映了一千四百万越南南方人民的迫切愿望，即独立、民主、和平和中立，进而和平统一祖国。
    毫无疑问，檀香山会议的结果清楚地表明了美帝国主义和南越卖国贼要赖在越南南方和准备进一步加强和扩大对越南南方的侵略的极端顽固的企图。他们叫嚷要“坚持不懈地谋求和平”，这只不过是一种烟幕，用来掩盖他们加紧向越南南方增兵和增运武器；使用B—52型战略轰炸机、毒剂、毒气等极端野蛮的战争手段和在越南南方更大规模地实行“杀光、烧光、毁光”的“焦土政策”；加紧轰炸越南民主共和国的领土；加剧在老挝的战争和加紧对柬埔寨发动挑衅性进攻的行动。
    越南南方民族解放阵线以一千四百万越南南方人民的名义，严厉谴责美帝国主义和西贡傀儡政权在檀香山会议上策划的阴谋。越南南方民族解放阵线紧急呼吁各国政府、各团体、个人和人民谴责美帝国主义者、制止他们在越南南方的血手、采取更加有力的措施来支持越南南方人民的爱国正义斗争。檀香山会议已经表明了美帝国主义的顽固和轻率。但是，美帝国主义者正在军事上和政治上遭到沉重失败，不管他们使出多大的力气和采取什么狡猾手段，他们侵略越南南方的阴谋毫无疑问将被粉碎。
    越南南方人民在过去十一年中团结起来，抗美救国，已经取得了辉煌的胜利。他们将继续提高警惕，加强团结，以坚定的决心，充分发挥爱国主义和充分显示对敌人的仇恨，给予美帝国主义和卖国贼更严重的打击，打败他们的侵略战争和赢得最后胜利。
