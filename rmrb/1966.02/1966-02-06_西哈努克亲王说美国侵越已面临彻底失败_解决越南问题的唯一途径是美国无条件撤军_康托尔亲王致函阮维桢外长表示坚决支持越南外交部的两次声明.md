    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 4th – Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk said that there is no other solution except for the unconditional withdrawal of American invaders from South Vietnam.

    Prince Sihanouk made the statement in response to a question raised by journalist Wilfred Burchett. The seventh issue of the recently published magazine "People's Socialist Community" published Prince Sihanouk's reply.

    When asked about his evaluation of the "peace offensive" launched by the United States, Prince Sihanouk said: "The Americans only put forward peace proposals when they have reached a dead end in South Vietnam and their colonialist schemes there face utter defeat. They will also put forward such peace proposals all over the world, while their real opponent, the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, controls four-fifths of its own South Vietnamese territory."

    The Prince said, "This Vietnam problem is entirely caused by the United States itself undermining the most important provisions of the 1954 Geneva Accords, which the American leaders turn a deaf ear to. Therefore, as long as they return to the root of the agreement, there will be no more problems."

    He continued, "'Returning to the root' means abiding by the provisions on the military neutralization of the country. In order to comply with this provision, France at that time had already withdrawn its troops from South Vietnam and dismantled its bases there. Obviously, there is no need for the armies of the United States, South Korea, Australia, and other countries to replace the French army."

    He emphasized, "There is no other solution except for the unconditional withdrawal of these invaders who caused the current situation."

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 5th – According to the Cambodian News Agency, Cambodian Royal Government Cabinet Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prince Kantol said in a letter to the Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Nguyen Duy Trinh, on the 4th: The Cambodian Royal Government and people firmly support the statements issued by the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 9th and 11th, 1966, and firmly stand on the side of the heroic Vietnamese people who are waging a just struggle against the American aggressors.

    In the letter, Prince Kantol expressed concern about the large-scale use of poison gas by the United States in South Vietnam and the criminal actions taken to intensify the war of aggression. The letter stated that the Cambodian Royal Government and the Cambodian people "strongly condemn these war criminals for the barbaric actions and despicable conspiracies they have taken to intensify the war of aggression in South Vietnam and expand the war to the entire Indochina."

    西哈努克亲王说美国侵越已面临彻底失败
    解决越南问题的唯一途径是美国无条件撤军
    康托尔亲王致函阮维桢外长表示坚决支持越南外交部的两次声明
    新华社金边四日电　柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王说，除了美国入侵者从南越无条件撤走外，没有其他解决办法。
    西哈努克亲王是在回答记者贝却敌所提出的问题时这样说的。最近出版的《人民社会同盟》杂志第七期发表了西哈努克亲王的这个回答。
    当问到他对美国发动的“和平攻势”作何评价时，西哈努克亲王说：“美国人只是在他们在南越已经走投无路，而且在那里的殖民主义勾当面临彻底失败的时候才提出和平建议的。他们还会在世界各地提出这种和平建议，他们真正的对手越南南方民族解放阵线控制着自己越南南方五分之四的领土。”
    亲王说，“这个越南问题完全是由于美国自己破坏了一九五四年日内瓦协议的最重要的条款而造成的，而美国领导人对此却装聋作哑。因此，只要他们回到协议的根源上去，就不会再有什么问题了。”
    他接着说，“‘回到根源上去’，就是说要遵守关于这个国家在军事上中立化的条款。为了遵守这项条款，法国当时已经从南越撤出它的军队和撤除它在那里建立的基地。显然，用不着美国、南朝鲜、澳大利亚和其它的军队来代替法国军队。”
    他着重地说，“除了造成目前局势的这些入侵者无条件撤走以外，没有其它解决办法。”
    新华社金边五日电　据柬埔寨新闻社报道，柬埔寨王国政府内阁首相兼外交大臣康托尔亲王在四日写给越南民主共和国外交部长阮维桢的信件说：柬埔寨王国政府和人民坚决支持越南民主共和国外交部一九六六年一月九日和十一日发表的声明，并且坚决站在为反对美国侵略者而进行正义斗争的英雄的越南人民一边。
    康托尔亲王在信中对美国在越南南方大规模使用毒气和为加紧进行侵略战争采取的罪恶行动表示关切。信件说，柬埔寨王国政府和柬埔寨人民“强烈地谴责这些战争罪犯为了加紧侵略南越的战争和把战争扩大到整个印度支那而采取的野蛮行动和卑鄙阴谋。”
