    The Workshop is Blooming with Daqing Flowers
    Shi Jiazhuang Tractor Parts Factory Jiang Ming
    The spring breeze blows open ten thousand trees of flowers, red slogans hang in the workshop: "Strive to be a Daqing enterprise, a Daqing person!" Like a spark scattered in the heart. Stand in front of the slogan, full of energy, stride onto the operating table, the lathe's steel spews fire. Vigorously shake the handle, the machine sounds "da-da," wishing to take down thousands of products at once, not to mention there are hundreds of barriers ahead, a revolutionary red heart can melt steel! Difficulties—snatch! Heavy burdens—shoulder! Our ambition is greater than the sky! Carry a red flag, read the four volumes of golden books, beat the drums and sing to realize revolutionization! Good news flies, the workshop's appearance changes, the furnace is red and the hammer is fierce! Countless iron men wave their arms together, the Daqing spirit blooms red flowers!
