　　In the united anti-China chorus of imperialism headed by the United States, reactionaries of all countries, and Khrushchev revisionists, Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro, following his public attack on China on January 2, issued a lengthy statement on February 6, actively joining the anti-China chorus.

　　In this anti-China statement, Prime Minister Castro used a large amount of venomous language to vilify the People's Republic of China. He accused China of being "dishonest," "shameless," "harboring sinister intentions," "treacherous," "hypocritical," "extremely insidious," "harboring the most vicious intentions," "hiding a dagger," engaging in "blackmail," "exerting pressure, aggression, and strangulation," using "the most base means of pirates, oppressors, and robbers," and carrying out "criminal activities of economic aggression" against Cuba. He even said that China "actually participated in this blockade" (referring to the US imperialist economic blockade of Cuba), that Chinese representatives contacted Cuban officers "with the purpose of enticing defection," and that China's methods and practices were "exactly the same as those used by the US Embassy in our country in the past when attempting to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and impose its will on this nation in one way or another." This statement made China out to be utterly heinous and utterly rotten.

　　China has steadfastly supported, supports now, and will continue to steadfastly support the Cuban people's struggle against US imperialist aggression and in defense of the fruits of their revolution. China has always adhered to proletarian internationalism and resolutely opposes great-power chauvinism. We have always believed that all countries in the world, regardless of size, are equal. Large countries should not bully small countries, and small countries should not bully large countries; everyone should adhere to principles and reason. Prime Minister Castro's incitement against China in his statement, under the pretext of China's rice exports to Cuba and the issue of China's distribution of printed materials in Cuba, is completely unreasonable.

　　Regarding the truth about the rice issue, the person in charge of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade has already listed the facts clearly in two talks on January 9 and January 30 this year. Prime Minister Castro has not been able to refute these facts, but stubbornly tries to shift the responsibility for Cuba's "serious economic difficulties" onto China. This trick of shifting blame is really not clever. Trade between two countries should be based on the principle of mutual benefit, through equal consultation, and in accordance with the agreements reached by both sides. It is normal for the two sides to have different opinions in trade negotiations. How can one use this as a basis to accuse socialist China, which has consistently been loyal to its internationalist obligations and has supported the Cuban people in all aspects, of being the same as the imperialists, of carrying out "criminal activities of economic aggression" against Cuba? In recent years, Cuba has not only failed to change the sugar monoculture economy left over by imperialism, but has instead implemented the so-called "international division of labor principle" of the Khrushchev revisionists, continuing to develop this deformed state, causing Cuba to encounter serious economic difficulties. Was this China's idea? Is this China's fault?

　　The truth about the issue of printed materials is equally clear. The Chinese Embassy and Chinese book distribution agencies are distributing bulletins and publications in Cuba, explaining China's policies and positions, which is completely normal, aboveboard, and beyond reproach. Why can the Cuban Embassy in China distribute printed materials publicizing Cuban viewpoints in China, but the Chinese Embassy in Cuba cannot do the same? Why allow the massive distribution of anti-China propaganda by the Soviet Communist Party leadership in Cuba, while fearing Chinese printed materials like a flood or ferocious beast? Why is there so little confidence in one's own cadres and officers, in one's own people?

　　Currently, anti-China voices are rampant in the world. The addition of Prime Minister Castro to the anti-China chorus is nothing significant. No matter who it is, no matter how much they try to appear impressive, they cannot add any weight; they are merely exposing themselves.

　　In socialist countries, whether it is the prime minister of a large country or the prime minister of a small country, whether it is a prime minister or a general cadre, whether they can be respected by the masses of the people depends on whether they are revolutionary or not, whether they are revolutionary to the end or give up halfway, whether they support revolution or oppose revolution, whether they oppose US imperialism or please US imperialism, whether they practice Marxism-Leninism or practice revisionism. Khrushchev was the prime minister of a very large country. After he embarked on the revisionist path, what kind of "respect" did he receive? Isn't this clear to everyone?

　　Prime Minister Castro once actively advocated "stopping public polemics." However, he has continuously attacked China since March of last year, publicly slandered China at a mass rally on January 2 this year, and issued an anti-China statement on February 6. Prime Minister Castro has gone very far on the anti-China road. Where he will eventually go remains to be seen.

　　The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people are used to being scolded. Not to mention the past scolding. Now, in foreign countries, imperialism headed by the United States scolds us, reactionary nationalists scold us, reactionaries of all countries scold us, and modern revisionists scold us; domestically, Chiang Kai-shek scolds us, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists scold us. It has always been like this, and we are used to it. Our attitude is to let them scold, and give appropriate answers when necessary.

　　We have not yet made a systematic response to Prime Minister Castro's attacks on China, and we reserve the right to respond.

　　Prime Minister Castro's statement on February 6 is a useful piece of material. We are now publishing it in its entirety here and broadcasting it to all parts of the world in multiple languages. We hope that the Chinese people, the people of Latin American countries, and the people of the world will read this material, think about the many questions it raises, and draw their own conclusions.

    在以美国为首的帝国主义、各国反动派和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者联合反华声中，古巴总理菲德尔·卡斯特罗继一月二日公开攻击中国之后，二月六日发表了冗长的声明，积极参加了反华大合唱。
    卡斯特罗总理在这篇反华声明里，使用了大量恶毒的语言，对中华人民共和国破口大骂。他指责中国“不诚实”，“恬不知耻”，“居心险恶”，“背信弃义”，“伪善”，“极端阴险”，“怀着最恶毒的意图”，“暗藏着一把匕首”，进行“敲诈勒索”，“施加压力、侵略和扼杀”，使用“最卑劣的海盗、压迫和强盗的手段”，对古巴进行了“经济侵略的罪恶活动”。他甚至说什么中国“实际上参加了这一封锁”（指美帝国主义对古巴的经济封锁），说什么中国代表同古巴军官接触“目的是劝诱变节”，说什么中国的手段和作法“同美国驻我国大使馆过去在企图干预古巴内政和用这种和那种方式把它的意志强加给这个民族时，所使用过的完全一样”。这篇声明，把中国说得简直是罪大恶极，简直是坏透了。
    中国过去、现在、将来都坚定不移地支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫革命果实的斗争。中国一贯坚持无产阶级国际主义，坚决反对大国沙文主义。我们历来认为，世界上所有国家，不分大小，一律平等。大国不该欺负小国，小国也不该欺负大国，大家都应当讲原则，讲道理。卡斯特罗总理在他的声明中，借口中国向古巴出口大米问题和中国在古巴发行印刷品问题煽动反华，是完全不讲道理的。
    关于大米问题的真相，中国对外贸易部负责人在今年一月九日和一月三十日的两次谈话中，已经列举事实，说得清清楚楚。卡斯特罗总理并没有能够驳倒这些事实，却硬要把古巴经济“遇到严重困难”的责任推到中国身上。这种嫁祸于人的手法，实在太不高明了。两个国家之间的贸易往来，理应根据互利的原则，通过平等协商，按照双方达成的协议办事。双方在贸易谈判中有不同的意见，这本来是正常的。怎么能够因此就把一贯忠于自己的国际主义义务、从各个方面支援古巴人民的社会主义的中国，骂成是跟帝国主义一样，骂成是对古巴进行“经济侵略的罪恶活动”呢？几年来，古巴不但没有改变帝国主义遗留下来的蔗糖单一经济，反而实行赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的所谓“国际分工的原则”，继续发展这种畸形状态，使古巴遇到严重经济困难，难道这是中国人出的主意吗？难道这是中国人的罪过吗？
    关于印刷品问题的真相，同样是很清楚的。中国使馆和中国书报发行机构，在古巴发行公报和书刊，阐明中国的政策和主张，这是完全正常的，是光明磊落、无可非议的。为什么古巴驻华使馆可以在中国散发宣传古巴观点的印刷品，而中国驻古巴使馆就不能这样做呢？为什么让苏共领导的反华宣传品在古巴大量发行，而对于中国的印刷品却象害怕洪水猛兽那样畏惧呢？为什么对本国的干部和军官，对本国的人民群众，那样没有信心呢？
    现在，世界上反华之声甚嚣尘上。在反华合唱队中增加了一位卡斯特罗总理，也没有什么不得了。不管什么人，不管他怎样摆出一副似乎很了不起的架势，其实都不可能加重什么份量，只不过是自我暴露而已。
    在社会主义国家中，不管是大国总理还是小国总理，也不管是总理还是一般干部，究竟能不能受到人民群众的尊重，取决于他革命还是不革命，革命到底还是半途而废，支持革命还是反对革命，反对美帝国主义还是讨好美帝国主义，实行马克思列宁主义还是实行修正主义。赫鲁晓夫是一个很大的国家的总理，他在走上了修正主义的邪路以后，究竟受到了什么样的“尊重”，这不是大家都看到了的吗？
    卡斯特罗总理曾经积极地鼓吹“停止公开论战”。但是，他从去年三月起就对中国连续进行攻击，今年一月二日在群众大会上公开诬蔑中国，二月六日又发表反华声明。卡斯特罗总理在反华的道路上已经走得很远了。他究竟要走到那里去，人们将拭目以待。
    中国共产党和中国人民是被人家骂惯了的。从前骂的不说。现在呢，在外国，以美国为首的帝国主义骂我们，反动的民族主义者骂我们，各国反动派骂我们，现代修正主义者骂我们；在国内，蒋介石骂我们，地、富、反、坏、右骂我们。历来就是这么骂的，已经听惯了。我们的态度是，由他们骂去，在必要的时候给以适当的答复。
    对于卡斯特罗总理攻击中国的言论，我们至今还没有做系统的答复，我们保留答复的权利。
    卡斯特罗总理二月六日的声明是一篇有用的材料。我们现在把它全文刊载在这里，并且用多种语文向世界各地广播。希望中国人民、拉丁美洲各国人民和全世界人民读一读这份材料，想一想它提出的许多问题，得出自己的结论。
