Title: Vietnamese *People's Daily* Publishes Article by a Soldier Arguing that the Only Way to Restore Peace in Vietnam is for the American Devils to Get Out of South Vietnam. Some "Well-meaning People" Fail to Distinguish Between Aggressor and Aggressed, Saying Both Sides Should "Compromise" and "Negotiate." How Strange!

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th. The Vietnamese *People's Daily* published an article by a soldier on the 18th, stating that there is only one way to restore peace in Vietnam: that is, the American devils get out of South Vietnam.

    The article, entitled "Crystal Clear," stated that in this world, sometimes some things are as clear as day, but some people still don't see them, don't want to see them, or pretend not to see them. For example, the issue of war and peace in Vietnam is as clear as day: the American bandits are the aggressors, Vietnam is the aggressed, and must fight to the end for self-defense. If the United States stops its war of aggression, peace in Vietnam can be restored immediately.

    The article said that, however, there are some "well-meaning people" in the world who do not distinguish between aggressor and aggressed, and they say that both sides should "compromise" and "negotiate." How strange!

    The article pointed out that Cambodian Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk recently, in an editorial he wrote for the magazine *Popular Socialist Community*, severely condemned the American bandits, enthusiastically supported Vietnam, and criticized the United Nations, the Vatican authorities, the "governments that call themselves peace envoys," and some so-called "well-meaning people" who came out to advise the Vietnamese people to stop fighting and negotiate peace with the United States.

    The article said that Prince Sihanouk pointed out: Cambodia and Vietnam "now and in the future are unanimous in believing that: 'We want peace, yes, but not peace at any cost, not peace at the expense of national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.'" The Vietnamese people fully agree with Prince Sihanouk's firm words. The Vietnamese people are determined to resist to the end and drive the American bandits out of our beloved homeland.

    The article concluded by saying that there is only one way to restore peace, and that is: the American devils get out of South Vietnam.

    越南《人民报》发表署名战士写的文章指出
    恢复越南和平唯一办法就是美国佬滚出南越
    有些“好心人”对侵略者和被侵略者不分是非，说双方都应该“让步”和“谈判”。真是奇怪！
    新华社河内十八日电　越南《人民报》十八日发表战士写的一篇文章说，只有一个恢复越南和平的办法，那就是：美国佬滚出越南南方。
    这篇题为《昭然若揭》的文章说，世间，有时有些事象白昼一样清楚，但仍有人看不见、不愿看见、或假装没看见。比如越南的战争与和平问题，就是和白昼一样清楚的事：美国强盗是侵略者，越南是被侵略者，必须为了自卫而战斗到底。美国停止侵略战争，便可立即恢复越南的和平。
    文章说，可是，世界上有些“好心人”对侵略者和被侵略者不分是非，他们说双方都应该“让步”和“谈判”。真是奇怪！
    文章指出，柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王最近在他为《人民社会同盟》杂志写的一篇社论中，严厉地谴责了美国强盗，热情地支持了越南，并且批判了联合国、教廷当局、自称为“和平使者的政府”以及一些所谓“好心人”跑出来劝越南人民停止战斗，同美国进行和谈。
    文章说，西哈努克亲王指出：柬埔寨和越南“现在和将来都一致认为：‘要和平，是的，但不是不惜一切的和平，不是拿国家的独立、主权和领土完整来作交易的和平’。”越南人民完全赞同西哈努克亲王这番斩钉截铁的话。越南人民坚决抗战到底，把美国强盗赶出我们亲爱的国土。
    文章最后说，只有一个恢复和平的办法，那就是：美国佬滚出越南南方。
