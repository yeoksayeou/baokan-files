　　According to regulations, boiler workers should arrive at the site half an hour early to prepare for the shift. Once, Jin Chengfu, a boiler worker at Liaoyuan Power Plant, was two minutes late, which did not attract much attention. Unexpectedly, at the post-shift meeting, Jin Chengfu proactively made a self-criticism of this matter. He said, "We workers have a high degree of organizational discipline. If it's stipulated as thirty minutes, not even a second can be off!" Everyone was very moved upon hearing this and said, "Right, we should be conscious and strictly demand ourselves according to high standards!" Jin Chengfu’s self-criticism was praised by everyone.
　　Since we advocate a "strict" work style, we should be "strict with ourselves" like Jin Chengfu, and we should possess the "strict" spirit of "not even a second can be off" like Jin Chengfu. If being two minutes late is Jin Chengfu’s shortcoming, then making a timely self-criticism at the post-shift meeting is Jin Chengfu’s merit. Jin Chengfu criticized his own shortcoming, and everyone praised Jin Chengfu's merit. The self-criticism was good, and the praise was also good.

    检讨和表扬
    按规定，锅炉工人要提前半小时到现场做班前准备。有一次，辽源发电厂锅炉工人金成富迟到了两分钟，大家并没有注意。没想到班后会上，金成富主动地检讨了这件事。他说：“咱工人是有高度组织纪律的。规定三十分，就一秒也不能差！”大家听了，很受感动，都说：“对，咱们应当自觉，按高标准严格要求自己！”金成富的这次检讨受到了大家的表扬。
    我们既然提倡“严”的作风，就应该像金成富这样“严以律己”，就应该像金成富这样具有“一秒钟也不能差”的“严”的精神。如果说迟到两分钟是金成富的缺点；那末，及时在班后会上做了检讨，又是金成富的优点。金成富检讨了自己的缺点，大家又表扬了金成富的优点。检讨得好，表扬得也好。
