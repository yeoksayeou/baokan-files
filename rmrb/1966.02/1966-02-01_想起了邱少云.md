    Remembering Qiu Shaoyun
    The heavy rain lasted for three days and three nights. On the morning of the fourth day, the sky was still not clear. To seize time from the enemy, the troops were pulled out for training. The training ground assigned to the fifth squad, where Mai Xiande was, was a muddy puddle, full of yellow mud soup. How could they crawl in this!
    At this moment, Mai Xiande suddenly remembered the story of the martyr Qiu Shaoyun that the squad leader had told him… He thought, Qiu Shaoyun was burned by flames, and never revealed his target until his death. Could it be that we are even afraid of this puddle…? Thinking of this, Mai Xiande felt as if a fire was burning all over him. He shouted: "We are not afraid of dying in battle against the enemy, so what are we afraid of!" and plunged into the puddle. The yellow mud water immediately soaked Mai Xiande's whole body. The water was very cold, and he couldn't help shivering. Mai Xiande gritted his teeth, steeled his heart, and continued to lie in the water to practice aiming. Inspired by Mai Xiande, the comrades crawled into the water to practice one by one. Instantly, this cold water seemed to be warmed up by the fire of killing the enemy in the hearts of Mai Xiande and his comrades.

    想起了邱少云
    大雨下了三天三夜，到第四天清早，天还没晴，为了和敌人抢时间，部队拉出去搞训练。分配给麦贤得所在的五班训练场地是一块水洼地，尽是黄泥汤。这可怎么爬呀！
    这时，麦贤得猛地想起班长给他讲的邱少云烈士的故事……。他想，邱少云烈火烧身，至死都没暴露目标，难道我们连这块水洼地都……，想到这，麦贤得好象浑身燃起一把火，他喊了一声：“杀敌陷阵死都不怕，还怕这！”就一下扑到洼地上去。黄泥水一下浸湿了麦贤得全身，水很凉，他不由地打了一个冷颤。麦贤得牙一咬心一横，继续伏在水里练瞄准。在麦贤得的带动下，同志们一个一个都爬在水里练起来。刹时，这冷冷的水，也好象被麦贤得和战友们胸中杀敌的烈火烘热了。
