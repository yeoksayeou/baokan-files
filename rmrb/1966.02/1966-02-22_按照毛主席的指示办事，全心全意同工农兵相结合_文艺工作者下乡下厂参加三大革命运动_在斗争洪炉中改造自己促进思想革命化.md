　　According to Xinhua News Agency, February 21st—Adapting to the new situation of the deepening cultural revolution, literary and art workers in various places are forming a surge to go among the worker-peasant masses and participate in actual struggle to strengthen ideological transformation and further promote the revolutionization of literary and art teams. According to incomplete statistics, in the twenty-eight provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, in addition to grassroots cultural teams such as film projection teams that have been active in rural areas for many years, more than 160,000 literary and art workers have already gone to the countryside and factories.
　　This army of literary and art workers has been going to the front lines of rural and industrial production in the past year, with the vast majority going into the countryside to immerse themselves in life and work. Many of them participate in the Socialist Education Movement; others, based on different tasks and professional characteristics such as performance and creation, adopt various organizational forms such as cultural work teams, professional performance teams, writing groups, and staying at selected points for investigation, both immersing themselves in life and carrying out work. Currently, in most provinces and municipalities, the number of personnel going to the mountains and countryside has reached or exceeded one-third of the total number of personnel in their respective regions and units. In many regions and literary and art units, more than half of the personnel are frequently active in rural areas and mines. Cultural departments in various places are comprehensively planning and making overall arrangements to ensure that literary and art workers' immersion among workers, peasants, and soldiers gradually becomes regularized and systematized, thereby ensuring that many literary and art units can regularly have one-third of their personnel participating in the Socialist Education Movement at the grassroots level; one-third going to rural areas and mines to participate in cultural popularization work; and the remaining one-third staying in their units to persist in daily work. Through such alternating rotations, each professional literary and art worker can spend one-third to one-half of their time each year living with workers, peasants, and soldiers.
　　Responsible persons of relevant departments, in analyzing the characteristics and significance of the current movement of literary and art workers going to the mountains and countryside, pointed out that this is the largest, most extensive, and far-reaching socialist cultural grand march since liberation; it is also a century-long plan for the literary and art circles to study Chairman Mao's works, further integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and promote the revolutionization of literary and art teams. This group of literary and art workers going to the mountains and countryside includes party organizations and administrative leaders of cultural departments at all levels, as well as many famous authors, actors, directors, editors, performers, etc., in literature, film, drama, music, dance, fine arts, publishing, and folk art. This time, they are not going down to "collect creative materials" as some did in the past, but mainly to participate in the three great revolutionary movements and transform their thinking. Most of the personnel who went to the countryside this time directly went to production teams or production brigades as soon as they arrived in the countryside, insisted on eating, living, and working with poor and lower-middle peasants, not afraid of getting dirty or tired, truly putting down their airs, being pupils of the masses, wholeheartedly carrying out ideological revolution, and striving to "go to the countryside in both body and mind." In the process of immersing themselves in life, the vast number of literary and art workers diligently studied Chairman Mao's works. Many people used Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as a mirror to examine, compare, and reflect on themselves at all times, find gaps, and learn from advanced examples. The vast number of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants' utter devotion to the revolutionary cause, the soaring enthusiasm and down-to-earth spirit of the socialist "new Foolish Old Man" in transforming heaven and earth, deeply educated the literary and art workers who went to the countryside. At the same time, they accumulated valuable ideological and life foundations for expressing the new socialist life and new socialist people in future creations. They used the phrase "giving charcoal in snowy weather, warming oneself by the fire" to describe the sweetness they tasted from going to the countryside this time. Some people, not long after returning from the countryside, requested to go again. Many people often said affectionately: "I will never forget this rural home for the rest of my life!"
　　While immersing themselves in life and transforming their thinking, the literary and art workers who went to the countryside and factories also used several main channels such as literary and art performances, film and slide screenings, and book distribution, and adopted various forms popular with the masses to bring revolutionary culture to the most grassroots level and to the worker-peasant masses. Many art performance units and film projection teams at the prefectural and county levels that were more frequently active in rural areas in the past have now formulated more reasonable plans for performances in the countryside, striving to enable farmers to see more plays and movies. Many literary and art groups at the provincial and municipal levels, which had less experience in going to the countryside in the past, have also further oriented themselves to the countryside, sending small teams to travel light, climb high mountains, go to remote villages, and deliver performances to their doorsteps, beginning to be called "peasant theater troupes" by the farmers. Many cultural work teams also closely cooperated with the three great revolutionary movements of rural class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, publicizing Mao Zedong Thought, telling current events and the party's policies, commending local good people and good deeds, telling revolutionary stories, teaching revolutionary songs, and actively guiding mass amateur cultural activities, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, changing customs and habits, and further consolidating and expanding the socialist ideological and cultural positions in the countryside. Some comprehensive work teams organized by cultural administration and professional personnel, in the process of in-depth squatting at selected points, also focused on understanding and studying some new situations and new problems in the cultural revolution in rural areas and mines, listening to the opinions and requirements of the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants on cultural work, and studying the experience of cultural work in coordinating with the three great revolutionary movements.
　　The central and local relevant departments attach great importance to the political and ideological work and specific leadership of the literary and art workers who go to the countryside. Leading cadres of many departments personally went to the front line, starting to study and solve new problems that arise in the literary and art workers' immersion in life. Many literary and art workers who went to the countryside and factories expressed in their letters that they must listen to the Party's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, wholeheartedly integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, wholeheartedly serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and temper themselves to be more enriched and stronger in the crucible of mass struggle and labor.

　　按照毛主席的指示办事，全心全意同工农兵相结合
　　文艺工作者下乡下厂参加三大革命运动
    在斗争洪炉中改造自己促进思想革命化
    据新华社二十一日讯　适应文化革命深入发展的新形势，各地文艺工作者正在形成一个到工农群众中去，参加实际斗争的热潮，以加强思想改造，进一步促进文艺队伍的革命化。据不完全统计，全国二十八个省、市、自治区中，除了电影放映队等长年在农村活动的基层文化队伍以外，目前已经有十六万多名文艺工作者下乡下厂。
    这批文艺大军是最近一年来陆续开赴农村、工矿生产第一线的，绝大部分在农村深入生活和工作。他们当中有很多人参加社会主义教育运动；有的则根据演出、创作等不同的任务和业务特点，采取文化工作队、专业演出队、创作小组和蹲点调查等多种多样的组织形式，一边深入生活，一边开展工作。现在，大多数省市的文艺单位，上山下乡的人员都达到或超过了本地区、本单位人员总数的三分之一。不少地区和文艺单位有半数以上的人经常在农村和工矿活动。各地文化部门正在全面规划和统筹安排，使文艺工作者深入工农兵逐步走向经常化和制度化，从而保证许多文艺单位都能够做到经常有三分之一的人员在基层参加社会主义教育运动；三分之一的人到农村和工矿参加文化普及工作；另外三分之一的人留在本单位坚持日常工作。这样交替轮换，每个专业文艺工作者每年就可以有三分之一或一半左右的时间同工农兵生活在一起。
    有关部门负责人在分析当前文艺工作者上山下乡的特点和意义时指出，这是解放以来规模最大、范围最广、影响深远的一次社会主义文化大进军；也是文艺界大学毛主席著作，进一步同工农兵相结合，促进文艺队伍革命化的百年大计。这批上山下乡的文艺工作者中，包括各地文化部门的党组织和行政领导人，以及文学、电影、戏剧、音乐、舞蹈、美术、出版、曲艺等方面许多著名的作者、演员、导演、编辑、演奏人员等。他们这次下去，不象过去有些人下乡只是为了“收集创作材料”，而是以参加三大革命运动、改造思想为主要目的。这次下乡的大多数人员一到农村，就直接深入到生产队或生产大队，坚持和贫农下中农同吃同住同劳动，不怕脏，不怕累，真正放下架子，做群众的小学生，一心进行思想革命，努力做到“人下乡心也下乡”。广大文艺工作者在深入生活过程中，努力学习毛主席著作，许多人以毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》做镜子，随时随地照自己、比自己、想自己，找差距，学先进。广大职工和贫农下中农对革命事业的赤胆忠心，社会主义的“新愚公”们改天换地的冲天干劲和踏实精神，使下乡的文化艺术工作者受到了深刻的教育。同时，为今后在创作中表现社会主义新生活和社会主义新人积累着宝贵的思想和生活基础，他们用“雪中送炭，火暖自身”这句话，形容这次下乡所尝到的甜头。有些人刚刚从农村回来不久，就再度要求下去。许多人常常亲切地说：“我一辈子也忘不了农村这个家！”
    在深入生活、改造思想的同时，下乡下厂的文艺工作者还通过文艺演出、放映电影幻灯和图书发行等几个主要的渠道，采取群众喜闻乐见的多种形式，把革命文化送到最基层去，送到工农群众中去。许多过去比较经常在农村活动的专区、县一级的艺术表演单位和电影放映队，现在更合理地制定了下乡演出规划，力求使农民们能够多看到戏和电影。不少过去下乡较少的省市一级的文艺团体，也进一步面向农村，派小分队轻装出动，上高山，下远乡，送戏上门，开始被农民称做“庄户剧团”。许多文化工作队还紧密配合农村阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动，宣传毛泽东思想，讲述时事和党的方针政策，表扬当地的好人好事，大讲革命故事，教唱革命歌曲，并且积极辅导群众业余文化活动，兴无灭资，移风易俗，进一步巩固扩大农村的社会主义思想文化阵地。一些由文化行政和专业人员组织的综合性工作队，在深入蹲点的过程中，还着重了解和研究农村和工矿文化革命中的一些新情况和新问题，听取广大贫农下中农对文化工作的意见和要求，研究文化工作配合三大革命运动的经验。
    中央和各地有关部门十分重视对下乡文艺工作人员的政治思想工作和具体领导。许多部门的领导干部亲临第一线，着手研究解决文艺工作者深入生活中出现的新问题。许多下乡下厂的文艺工作者在来信中纷纷表示，一定要听党的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，全心全意同工农兵结合，全心全意为工农兵服务，在群众斗争和劳动的洪炉中，把自己锻炼得更加充实，更加坚强。（附图片）
