　　Enterprise Management Departments' "Ulanmuqi"
　　Bian Yejin
    Since the Anshan Iron and Steel Company launched the campaign to learn from the People's Liberation Army, learn from Daqing, and learn from Dazhai to promote the revolutionization of its offices, financial cadres and cadres from other departments have also stepped out of their offices and gone to the grassroots to serve production. At the beginning, our financial cadres only went down one line, only taking care of "money," and did not collaborate with other departments, so we could not thoroughly solve production problems at the grassroots. For example, in order to recover waste heat from production, the Medium Plate Mill needed to establish a vaporization cooling system. The finance department applied to the Construction Bank for a small technical measure loan, but because there was no equipment, construction could not proceed, and having funds was still useless. Due to a lack of comprehensive planning, on the one hand, the company's small technical measure loans could not be spent, and on the other hand, many technical innovation measures lacked this or that, and could not be completed. The financial personnel deeply felt that only by organizing the forces of all business departments to comprehensively serve the grassroots could they truly help. Therefore, with the company's decision, comrades from the finance and accounting, mechanical, power, and planning departments formed a comprehensive roving service group to go to the grassroots to serve production on a roving basis. In more than four months, the comprehensive roving service group solved more than 130 problems for the company's affiliated factories and mines, many of which were long-standing "difficult problems," and were deeply welcomed by the grassroots. The comprehensive roving service group pioneered a new path for the revolutionization of financial work and the revolutionization of office work, and was hailed as the "Ulanmuqi" of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's enterprise management departments.

　　Starting with Ideological Revolution
    At the beginning, the comrades of the comprehensive roving service group were full of worries, had a fear of difficulty, feared that they were not familiar with the business, that the hearts of the people were not aligned, that there would be no support, that they could not make decisions, that they had no capital, and that they could not solve the problems; they also feared that running around the factories and mines would cause them to lose their business skills and delay their future. Especially when they first went down, they heard that there was a shortage of equipment here and a shortage of materials there, and some units even brought out long-standing "difficult problems" that had not been solved for a long time, asking the service group to solve them, which made the comrades of the service group feel embarrassed. Faced with these ideological situations, we felt that we must solve the problem of how to treat the roving service work ideologically. Therefore, we decided to sit down and study Chairman Mao's works first. We studied "On the Chungking Negotiations" with this problem in mind. Chairman Mao said: "What is work? Work is struggle. Those places have difficulties and problems that need us to solve. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, that is a good comrade." "Hard work is like a burden placed before us, to see if we dare to bear it." Chairman Mao's words were precisely aimed at our thoughts. Since we went down to help the factories and mines solve problems, why were we afraid of people raising "difficult problems"? We usually said we wanted to serve the factories and mines, but why did we want to retreat when service was really needed? We repeatedly compared and pondered deeply, overcame the fear of difficulty, and established the confidence and determination that roving service could only be done well and not badly. Everyone realized that in order to transform the objective world, we must first transform our subjective world, and we must transform our subjective world in the practice of transforming the objective world. Everyone also realized that the transformation from sitting in the office in the past and handling affairs based on systems and procedures, relying on "managing" and "controlling," to going to the grassroots, delivering service to the door, and serving the factories and mines is itself a revolution. Since it is a revolution, there will be difficulties and struggles. Whether or not we dare to bear this heavy burden is a question of whether or not we want to make revolution.

    Recognizing the importance of the roving service work does not mean that all ideological problems have been solved. At that time, some comrades said that the company leaders had not been able to solve these "difficult problems" in the past, how could we few people be able to overcome them? With this question in mind, we turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On Contradiction": "At certain times in the revolutionary struggle, difficult conditions outweigh favorable conditions. At such times, difficulty constitutes the principal aspect of the contradiction and favorable conditions the secondary aspect. However, owing to the efforts of the revolutionaries it is possible gradually to overcome the difficult conditions and open up a favorable new situation, thus causing a change in the situation, with favorable conditions predominating and difficult conditions relegated to a secondary position." We understood from this that if we want to solve "difficult problems," we must fully rely on the masses and mobilize the masses to think of ways, and we cannot have dependent thinking. What specific approach should we take? We were still enlightened by Chairman Mao's works: Chairman Mao pointed out in "Reform Our Study": "In any department's work, we must first understand the situation before we can handle it well." In "Oppose Book Worship" he pointed out: "You cannot solve that problem? Then go and investigate the present state of that problem and its history! When you have thoroughly investigated and understood it, you will have a solution to that problem." We repeatedly studied these two passages, and realized that we must start with going deep into reality and conducting investigation and research. In this way, we repeatedly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and constantly carried out ideological revolution, and finally gained the wisdom and strength to dare to overcome difficulties.

　　Serving the Grassroots Wholeheartedly
    After the comprehensive roving service group goes deep into the scene, whether or not it can correctly solve the problems in production depends on whether or not it can always take Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to analyze and study the problems in production. The difficulties existing in factories and mines are almost all inseparable from money, materials, and equipment. It seems that doing good things for the grassroots requires spending money. However, we acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions on diligence and thrift, and carried forward the spirit of poor but hardworking, self-reliance, and hard struggle, and fully tapped internal potential, which not only solved production problems for factories and mines, but also saved a lot of funds for the country. The Cast Pipe Factory needed forty small motors, and many factories and mines lacked this or that. On the one hand, we consulted the idle equipment catalog, and on the other hand, we investigated at the factories and mines, and found 250 idle equipment. Only a part of it was used, which solved the problems in production for the factories and mines and saved 220,000 yuan in investment for the country.

    In the roving service work, we firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "Contradiction exists in the process of development of all things; contradiction permeates the process of development of each thing from beginning to end...," and for every problem that the factories and mines ask to solve, as long as it is conducive to promoting production, we must seize it and never let go, overcome all difficulties, grasp it to the end, and completely solve it. The Cast Pipe Factory successfully innovated a new cast pipe process, which must have a large amount of cooling water to be put into production. The Cast Pipe Factory applied to the company for 180,000 yuan of investment to rebuild a reservoir for this purpose. However, because the opinions of relevant departments were inconsistent, and the investment was large, it had not been resolved. The comrades of the comprehensive roving service group went deep into the reservoir, in front of the cast pipe machine, and in the smoke-filled vertical pipe workshop, watching and asking questions. After on-site investigation, we not only figured out the situation of the cast pipe water supply system, but also saw with our own eyes the backward vertical cast pipe technology left over from the Japanese puppet period, which had low efficiency, high temperature, and flying dust, seriously affecting the health of the workers. A sense of class responsibility inspired us and strengthened our determination to solve this problem.

    On the basis of finding out the situation, the comrades of the comprehensive service group tried two solutions, but they did not work. We also consulted with the young technicians in charge of water in the Power Department and re-brewed two more solutions, but they were not applicable. During the on-site inspection, we found a large water pipe for the East Anshan Mine not far from the Cast Pipe Factory. Could we draw a stream of water from here for the Cast Pipe Factory to use and then send it back? With this idea, we consulted two technical experts one after another. As a result, one believed that this would contaminate the water and affect the quality of ore dressing; the other suspected that sending the water back after use would cause uneven pressure and disrupt the water cycle. At this critical moment, we thought of Chairman Mao's teachings that "The masses are the real heroes" and "The criterion of truth can only be social practice," and we would never retreat in the face of difficulties, but continue to go to the masses, to production practice, humbly ask the masses for advice, and conduct serious investigation and research. In order to solve the water pressure problem, we consulted the young technicians of the design institute and learned that the water pressure can be adjusted with a water pump. In order to select a suitable water pump, we walked nearly 20 miles back and forth along the main water pipe with the comrades in charge of water to conduct tests and get the correct test results. In order to solve the water quality problem, we went to the cast pipe machine with a temperature of more than 40 degrees to ask the workers for advice, and found that the water was originally a closed cycle, and there was no problem of water quality contamination at all. With first-hand materials, the problems raised by the above two technical experts were solved. With the support of the leaders, after joint research by relevant personnel, the plan was determined.

    Having a plan is only the first step in solving the problem. The comrades of the comprehensive service group were determined to grasp it to the end. We invited design, construction, production and other units to organize a "three-in-one" group to discuss on the spot and design on the spot. A series of construction preparations such as applying for investment, materials, handling outsourcing procedures, and transferring equipment were all contracted separately, running to six or seven units one after another, contacting them more than ten times, and obtaining the strong support of relevant departments.

    When the project was nearing completion, it was necessary to tap the main water pipe to divert water, and the problem of whether the water stop would affect the production of the mine appeared again. The comrades of the comprehensive service group went to the water-using units in the mine to investigate and learned that the mine had a reservoir that could be used when the main water pipe was stopped. The last hurdle was also broken.

    This "difficult problem," which was once intended to be solved with 180,000 yuan, was solved this time with only 28,000 yuan. It not only met the needs of continuous cast pipe production in the Cast Pipe Factory and reduced costs, but also solved the problem of the East Anshan Mine needing warm water.

　　Several Experiences
    The comprehensive roving service group is a product of the revolutionization of the offices and an effective new form for the functional management departments of large enterprises to serve the grassroots. It broke the one-sided view that functional departments only talk about division of labor and not integration; only talk about constraints and not promotion; only talk about technology and business, and not politics, and opened up a new way to solve production management problems quickly, well, and economically.

    The comprehensive roving service group can correctly solve the relationship between integration and division of labor. Enterprise management work should serve production, and there should be both division of labor and integration. Things are inherently interconnected, but due to the division of labor of each professional office (section), it is artificially divided. Each professional office "manages its own stall" and "takes charge of its own door," and the problems in production are often not completely solved, resulting in many "difficult problems." The comprehensive roving service group adopted the method of organizing various functional departments to serve the grassroots in a planned way, uniting the division of labor and integration. When problems are encountered, collective investigation and research are conducted, and suggestions and plans are made. Therefore, handling problems can be more comprehensive and combined with reality, greatly reducing the subjective and one-sided components, and the problems are easier to solve. From practice, we have realized that the past "difficult problems" are actually only "old" and not "difficult."

    The comprehensive roving service group can correctly solve the relationship between service and management. Roving service not only does not weaken management, but also strengthens management. The comrades of the comprehensive service group realized from the practice of solving equipment, funds, and other problems for factories and mines that service and management are consistent and not disjointed. Only through service can management be better strengthened. At the same time, in the roving service work, we also found many weak links in business management and problems in the system that are not adapted to the development of production, and strive to improve them in our work. Therefore, roving service is also conducive to overcoming bureaucracy in leading organs.

    Roving service is a method for financial work to follow the mass line, which is conducive to promoting production development and implementing the Party's policy of diligence and thrift in running enterprises. In the past, financial departments were accustomed to sitting in the office, doing routine work, relying on the system and regulations to "strictly manage and control," which bound the enthusiasm of the masses. The above-mentioned difficult problem of cooling water in the Cast Pipe Factory was solved by relying on the masses and concentrating the wisdom of the masses. If we relied solely on the "system and regulations," this good thing would not be done. In the roving service work, financial personnel can often publicize and implement the Party's policy of diligence and thrift in running enterprises and practicing economy, so that the relevant financial and economic systems can be mastered and used by the broad masses. This turns the supervision of the pure financial department into the supervision of the masses.

    Roving service is conducive to financial cadres transforming their thinking and promoting ideological revolutionization. Roving service must go deep into the reality of production and contact the masses, which is more conducive to financial cadres going to the struggle of the three major revolutionary movements to exercise, transforming their subjective world while transforming the objective world, constantly transforming their thinking in practice, establishing the feelings of ordinary workers, overcoming metaphysics, learning dialectics, and establishing the idea of serving production wholeheartedly.

　　企业管理部门的“乌兰牧骑”
　　边野今
    鞍山钢铁公司自从大学解放军，大学大庆，大学大寨，开展机关革命化运动以来，财务干部和其他处室干部一样，也纷纷走出办公室，到基层为生产服务。刚开始的时候，我们财务干部只是单线下去，只管“钱”，不同其他部门协作，结果是不能彻底地为基层解决生产中的问题。例如，中板厂为回收生产中的余热，需要建立汽化冷却设备，财务部门就向建设银行申请小型技术措施贷款，但由于没有设备不能施工，有了资金也还是无济于事。由于缺乏全面安排，一方面，公司申请到的小型技术措施贷款却花不出去，另一方面，有许多技术革新措施缺这少那，办不成。财务人员深深感到只有把各业务部门的力量组织起来，下去全面地为基层服务才行。于是，经公司决定，财务会计、机械、动力、计划等部门的同志组成综合巡回服务组，到基层去，巡回为生产服务。综合巡回服务组，在四个多月中，为公司所属厂矿解决了一百三十多个问题，其中不少是“老大难”问题，深受基层欢迎。综合巡回服务组为财务工作革命化、机关工作革命化开创了一条新路子，被誉为鞍钢企业管理部门的“乌兰牧骑”。
　　从思想革命入手
    开始的时候，综合巡回服务组的同志们顾虑重重，有畏难情绪，怕业务不熟，众心不齐，无人支持，不能做主，没有本钱，解决不了问题；又怕围着厂、矿跑，丢了业务技术，耽误了前程。特别是刚一下去，就听到这里缺设备，那里少材料，有的单位还把长期以来都没有解决的“老大难”问题端了出来，要服务组解决，使服务组的同志感到为难。面对着这些思想情况，我们觉得，必须从思想上解决怎样对待巡回服务工作的问题。于是，就决定先坐下来学习毛主席著作。我们带着这个问题学习了《关于重庆谈判》。毛主席说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。”毛主席的这些话，正是针对我们的思想说的。既然下去是为了帮助厂、矿解决问题，为什么还怕人家提“老大难”问题呢？平时口口声声说要为厂、矿服务，为什么到真正需要服务的时候，又想打退堂鼓呢？我们反复对照深思，克服了畏难情绪，树立了巡回服务只能搞好不能搞坏的信心和决心。大家认识到要想改造客观世界，首先要改造自己的主观世界，而且要在改造客观世界的实践中，改造自己的主观世界。大家还认识到，由过去坐在办公室里靠制度、手续办事，靠“管”、“卡”办事，转变到下基层，送上门，为厂、矿服务，本身就是一场革命。既然是革命，就不会没有困难和斗争。敢不敢承担这副重担子，是想不想、要不要革命的问题。
    认识了巡回服务工作的重要性，并不等于说思想问题都解决了。当时，有的同志说，这些“老大难”问题，过去公司领导都没能解决，咱们这几个人就能啃得动？我们带着这个问题，又向毛主席著作求教。毛主席在《矛盾论》里指出：“革命斗争中的某些时候，困难条件超过顺利条件，在这种时候，困难是矛盾的主要方面，顺利是其次要方面。然而由于革命党人的努力，能够逐步地克服困难，开展顺利的新局面，困难的局面让位于顺利的局面。”我们从中理解到，要想解决“老大难”问题，就要充分依靠群众，发动群众想办法，不能有依赖思想。具体做法又从何入手呢？还是从毛主席著作中得到了启示：毛主席在《改造我们的学习》一文中指出：“任何一个部门的工作，都必须先有情况的了解，然后才会有好的处理。”在《反对本本主义》一文中指出：“你对于那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧！你完完全全调查明白了，你对那个问题就有解决的办法了。”我们反复学习了这两段话，认识到必须从深入实际、调查研究入手。我们就这样反复不断地活学活用毛主席著作，不断地进行思想革命，终于获得了敢于战胜困难的智慧和力量。
　　全心全意为基层服务
    综合巡回服务组深入现场后，能不能正确地解决生产中的问题，关键在于能不能处处以毛泽东思想为指针，分析和研究生产中的问题。厂、矿存在的难题，差不多件件都离不开钱、材料和设备。似乎为基层办好事，非花钱不可。但是，我们按毛主席勤俭节约的指示办事，发扬了穷干苦干，自力更生，艰苦奋斗的精神，充分挖掘内部潜力，既为厂、矿解决了生产问题，又为国家节约了大量资金。铸管厂需四十台小马达，还有许多厂、矿缺这少那。我们一方面查阅了闲置设备目录，一方面到各厂、矿摸底，找到了二百五十台闲置设备，只用了其中的一部分，就为厂、矿解决了生产中的问题，为国家节约投资二十二万元。
    在巡回服务工作中，我们牢记毛主席“矛盾存在于一切事物发展的过程中，矛盾贯串于每一事物发展过程的始终，……”的教导，对厂、矿提出要求解决的每一个问题，只要对促进生产有利，就一定抓住不放，排除万难，一抓到底，彻底解决。铸管厂革新成功一种铸管新工艺，必须有大量冷却水才能投入生产。铸管厂为此向公司申请十八万元投资，改建一座储水池。可是因为有关部门意见不一致，加之投资多，一直没有解决。综合巡回服务组的同志们就深入到储水池旁、铸管机前和烟尘熏人的立管车间，一边看，一边问。经过实地调查，不仅摸清了铸管供水系统的情况，而且亲眼看到日伪遗留下来的落后的立式铸管工艺，效率低，温度高，尘埃飞扬，严重地影响工人的身体健康。一种阶级责任感激发着我们，坚定了我们一定要解决这个问题的决心。
    在摸清情况的基础上，综合服务组的同志们试提了两个方案，都不行。又找动力处管水的青年技术员一起商量，再次酝酿了两个方案，也不适用。在现场查看中，我们发现有一条供东鞍山矿用的大水管，离铸管厂不远，能不能从这里引出一股水供铸管厂使用、用完后再送回去呢？我们带着这个主意，先后请教了两位技术行家。结果是：一个认为，这样会沾污用水，影响选矿质量；一个怀疑，水用后再送回去，压力不一，会打乱用水循环。在这紧急关头，我们又想起了毛主席的“群众是真正的英雄”、“真理的标准只能是社会的实践”的教导，在困难面前决不退缩，继续到群众中去，到生产实践中去，虚心地向群众求教，认真地作调查研究。为了解决水压问题，我们向设计院的青年技术员请教，知道水压可以用水泵来调整。为了选择适合的水泵，我们又和管水的同志一起，沿着主水管往返走了近二十里路，进行测试，得到了正确的测试结果。为了解决水质问题，我们走到温度高达四十多度的铸管机前向工人请教，发现水原来是密闭循环的，根本不存在沾污水质的问题。有了第一手材料，上述两位技术行家提出的问题解决了，在领导支持下，经有关人员共同研究，确定了方案。
    有了方案，还只是解决问题的第一步。综合服务组的同志们决心抓到底。我们邀请设计、施工、生产等单位组织“三结合”小组，到现场就地商量，就地进行设计。对于申请投资、材料、办理外包手续、调拨设备等一系列施工准备工作，都分别包了下来，先后跑了六、七个单位，联系了十多次，取得了有关部门的大力支持。
    工程接近尾期的时候，需要凿通主水管引水，又出现了停水会不会影响矿山生产的问题。综合服务组的同志们又到矿山各用水单位调查，了解到矿山有储水池，可供主水管停水时用。最后一关也突破了。
    这个过去曾经打算用十八万元解决的“老大难”问题，这次只花了二万八千元就解决了。不仅满足了铸管厂连续铸管生产的需要，降低了成本，还解决了东鞍山矿需用温水的问题。
　　几点体会
    综合巡回服务组是机关革命化的产物，是大型企业职能管理部门为基层服务的一个有效的新形式。它破除了那种职能部门只讲分工，不讲综合；只讲制约，不讲促进；只讲技术、业务，不讲政治的片面观点，为多快好省地解决生产管理问题开创了新门路。
    综合巡回服务组能够正确解决综合和分工的关系问题。企业管理工作要为生产服务，既要有分工，又要有综合。事物本来是相互联系的，由于各专业处（科）的分工，把它人为地分割了，各专业处“自管一摊”、“各把一门”，生产上的问题往往得不到彻底解决，造成了不少的“老大难”问题。综合巡回服务组采取把各职能部门组织起来，有计划地为基层服务，把分工与综合统一起来，遇到问题，集体调查研究，出谋划策，因此，处理问题就比较能够综观全局，结合实际，大大减少了主观、片面的成分，问题也好解决了。从实践中，我们体会到，过去的“老大难”问题，实际上只是“老大”，并不“难”。
    综合巡回服务组能够正确解决服务与管理的关系问题。巡回服务不仅不会削弱管理，而且还可以加强管理。综合服务组的同志们从为厂、矿解决设备、资金等问题的实践中，体会到服务与管理是一致的，不是互相脱节的，只有通过服务，才能更好地加强管理。同时，在巡回服务工作中，我们也发现了不少的经营管理上的薄弱环节和体制上不适应生产发展等问题，并且在工作上力求改善。所以，巡回服务也有利于克服领导机关的官僚主义。
    巡回服务是财务工作走群众路线的方法，有利于促进生产发展和贯彻党的勤俭办企业的方针、政策。过去财务部门习惯于坐办公室，例行公事，靠制度、条条“死管硬卡”，束缚了群众的积极性。上述铸管厂冷却水这个难题，就是坚持依靠群众，集中群众智慧共同解决的，如果单凭“制度、条条”，这件好事就办不成。财务人员在巡回服务工作中，就能经常向群众宣传和贯彻党的勤俭办企业、厉行节约的方针、政策，使有关的财经制度能够为广大群众所掌握和运用。这就把单纯财务部门的监督变为群众的监督。
    巡回服务有利于财务干部改造思想，促进思想革命化。巡回服务必须深入生产实际，接触群众，这就更有利于财务干部到三大革命运动的斗争中去锻炼，在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界，在实践中不断改造思想，建立普通劳动者的感情，克服形而上学，学会辩证法，树立全心全意为生产服务的思想。
