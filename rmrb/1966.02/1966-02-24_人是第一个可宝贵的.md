　　Man is the First and Most Precious
    The natural landscapes and production bases of Yanjin and Lankao are roughly the same. Both are old disaster areas in Henan Province, suffering from three major natural disasters year after year: waterlogging, wind and sand, and saline-alkali soil. So, why was Lankao able to subdue the "three harms" in a relatively short period, change production conditions, and initially achieve self-sufficiency in grain? Why haven't Yanjin's achievements in eradicating the "three harms" been as great, and why hasn't the grain shortage situation been reversed? Ultimately, it is because we haven't studied and applied Chairman Mao's works well enough. Chairman Mao taught us: "Of all things in the world, man is the first and most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle can be created." I have been working in Yanjin for five years, and I have always believed that Yanjin is one of the counties with the most serious disasters in the province and the Xinxiang region. No matter how well we work here, it is not easy for the development of agricultural production to move ahead of other brother counties, and the natural landscape cannot be changed quickly. Under the guidance of this thought, I only saw things and not people, and I neglected the active role of the thousands of hard-working people of Yanjin in transforming nature. Therefore, I did not dare to break through or innovate, and I did not have a clear understanding of the situation of subduing the "three harms," and my determination was not great enough. Although I also did some investigation and research work, I did not go as deeply and meticulously as Comrade Jiao Yulu into the wind and sand, into the rainstorms, into the flood torrents, to conduct investigation and research team by team. I did not have a clear enough understanding of the origins and course of the "three harms" in the whole county, and I did not understand them thoroughly enough, and I did not weigh them accurately. How many sand dunes are there in the county? Where are they? How to seal them off? How many wind gaps are there? Where are they? How to block them? How many low-lying areas are there? Where are they? How to manage them? I did not, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, use first-hand materials to formulate a scientific and concrete transformation plan. Because there was no standard in my mind for managing the "three harms," I was not very clear about what would constitute subduing the "three harms," so I was complacent and satisfied with the status quo after making some achievements.
    From the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, I realized how important it is for the "squad leader" of the county party committee to realize ideological revolutionization. In the future, I will take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the leadership team of the county party committee. We will do what Chairman Mao said, so that the county party committee becomes a strong and thoroughly revolutionary leadership core, caring for and relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and closely connecting with the masses; despising difficulties like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and moving forward in the face of difficulties; working selflessly, enduring great hardship and heavy labor like Comrade Jiao Yulu; living a hard and simple life and setting an example like Comrade Jiao Yulu. Grasping the main contradiction of waterlogging, wind and sand, and saline-alkali soil, giving full play to the subjective initiative of people, re-investigating and researching, revising the plan, and striving to completely transform the natural landscape of Yanjin in a relatively short period of time.

　　人是第一个可宝贵的
    延津和兰考的自然面貌、生产基础大体是相同的，都是常年遭受着内涝、风沙、盐碱三大自然灾害，都是河南的老灾区。那么，为什么兰考能在较短时间内制伏“三害”，改变了生产条件，初步实现了粮食自给呢？为什么延津根治“三害”的成绩没有那么大，缺粮局面还没有扭转呢？归根到底是我们活学活用毛主席著作不够。毛主席教导我们：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”我到延津工作五年了，总是认为延津在全省、在新乡地区都是特重灾县之一，在这里工作得再好，农业生产的发展也不易走到其他兄弟县的前边，自然面貌也不易迅速获得改变。在这种思想指导下，只见物，不见人，忽视了成千上万的勤劳的延津人民群众在改造大自然中的积极作用。因此，便不敢闯、不敢创，对制伏“三害”的情况不明，决心不大。我虽然也作了一些调查研究工作，但没有象焦裕禄同志那样深入细致地到大风沙里，到暴雨中，到洪水激流中，逐队调查研究。全县“三害”的来龙去脉摸得不够清，吃得不够透，重量掂得不准。全县有多少个沙岗？在什么地方？怎样封锁？有多少个风口？在什么地方？怎样封堵？有多少个低洼地？在什么地方？怎样治理？没有象焦裕禄同志那样，用第一手材料制定出一个科学的具体的改造方案。由于头脑里没有一个治理“三害”的准绳，究竟怎样才算制伏了“三害”不大清楚，所以取得了一些成绩就沾沾自喜，满足现状。
    从焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹里，我认识到：作为县委的“班长”，实现思想革命化是多么重要。今后，我要以身作则，带头学好毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装县委领导班子。毛主席怎样说的，我们就怎样做，使县委成为一个坚强的、彻底革命化的领导核心，象焦裕禄同志那样关心和依靠贫下中农，密切联系群众；象焦裕禄同志那样藐视困难，迎着困难前进；象焦裕禄同志那样吃大苦，耐大劳，忘我地工作；象焦裕禄同志那样艰苦朴素，以身作则。抓住内涝、风沙、盐碱这个主要矛盾，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，重新调查研究，修订规划，力争在较短时间内，彻底改造延津的自然面貌。
