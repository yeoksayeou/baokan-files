    To Be a Revolutionary Means Summarizing Experiences
    Quite a few grassroots cadres hold incorrect views on summarizing experiences:
    I. They believe that agricultural production is the same year after year, spring, summer, autumn, and winter, always following the three-part song of planting, managing, and harvesting, so there's no need to summarize experiences.
    II. The work of this unit is ordinary and uneventful, with nothing to summarize. If there really were any experience, wouldn't the higher authorities send people to help summarize it? Why bother expending extra effort oneself?
    III. Summarization is a matter for intellectuals. We are completely ignorant of writing and calculating; it's a case of "the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak"!
    The above viewpoints are obviously incorrect. We believe that summarizing experiences is the responsibility of everyone. If anyone doesn't know their own mistakes, of course they cannot correct them; if they are not clear about their own achievements, there is no way to promote them. Continuously summarizing experiences is the inescapable revolutionary responsibility of every revolutionary. The argument of inaction is wrong. As for why not make a summary, I am afraid that there is a lazy ideology at work.

### 是革命者就要总结经验

    是革命者就要总结经验
    有不少基层干部对总结经验存在着不正确的看法：
    一、认为农业生产年复一年，春夏秋冬，总是种、管、收三部曲，用不着总结经验。
    二、本单位工作平平淡淡，没有啥可以总结。如果真的有了经验，上级还不会派人来帮助总结吗？何必自己多费心机。
    三、总结是知识分子的事，咱写写算算一窍不通，是“心有余而力不足”呀！
    上述几种看法显然不对。我们认为，总结经验人人有责。任何人有错误自己不知道，当然也就无法纠正；有成绩自己不清楚，当然谈不上发扬光大。不断总结经验，是每一个革命者义不容辞的革命责任。无所作为的论点是错误的，至于为什么不作总结，恐怕有个懒惰思想在作怪。
