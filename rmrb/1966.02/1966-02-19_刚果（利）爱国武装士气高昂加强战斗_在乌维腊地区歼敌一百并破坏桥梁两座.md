    Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch: Brussels News: According to a report in the January 28th issue of the Belgian newspaper *The Voice of the People*, Benza, a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Youth Union of the Congo (Leopoldville), pointed out at a conference recently organized by the Belgian Committee in Support of the Congo (Leopoldville) Resistance Movement that the morale of the patriotic armed forces of the Congo (Leopoldville) is high, and the armed struggle of the Congolese (Leopoldville) people is continuing to develop.
    Benza said: The armed struggle of the Congolese (Leopoldville) people is being carried out in many areas. They are using guerrilla warfare tactics to eliminate enemy troops. On December 10th of last year, patriotic armed forces in eastern Congo (Leopoldville) occupied the stronghold of Nyangba, 40 kilometers from Albertville, and destroyed 10 kilometers of railway line. In the Uvira area, they killed 100 enemies and also destroyed two bridges leading from Kamanyola to Bukavu.
    Benza emphasized that the patriotic armed forces in the Congo (Leopoldville) must rely on the people in their struggle. He pointed out that relying on the people is an indispensable condition for the patriotic armed forces to achieve victory. He said that in all their work, the patriotic armed forces must solve various problems according to the interests of the people.
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch: Leopoldville News: Mobutu, the head of the Congolese (Leopoldville) puppet regime, signed another reactionary decree on the 15th, stipulating that anyone in the entire Congo is prohibited from holding strikes.
    Mobutu took this fascist measure after about 3,600 teachers in Leopoldville held a three-day strike starting on February 10th. These teachers held the strike because their demands for higher wages had not been answered by the puppet authorities.

    刚果（利）爱国武装士气高昂加强战斗
    在乌维腊地区歼敌一百并破坏桥梁两座
    新华社十七日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：据比利时《人民之声报》一月二十八日一期报道，刚果（利）革命青年联合会中央委员会委员本扎最近在比利时声援刚果（利）抵抗运动委员会组织的一次会议上指出：刚果（利）爱国武装力量的士气高昂，刚果（利）人民武装斗争正在继续发展。
    本扎说：刚果（利）人民武装斗争正在许多地区开展。他们运用游击战的战术消灭敌人的军队。去年十二月十日，刚果（利）东部的爱国武装力量占领了距阿伯特维尔四十公里的尼昂巴据点，破坏了十公里长的铁路线。在乌维腊地区打死了敌人一百人，还破坏了从卡马尼奥拉通向布卡伍的两座桥梁。
    本扎强调刚果（利）爱国武装在斗争中必须依靠人民。他指出：依靠人民是爱国武装取得胜利不可缺少的条件。他说，爱国武装在一切工作中要根据人民的利益解决各种问题。
    据新华社十七日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果（利）傀儡政权头目蒙博托十五日又签署了一项反动法令，规定在全刚果禁止任何人举行罢工。
    蒙博托是在利奥波德维尔大约三千六百名教师从二月十日起举行了三天罢教以后采取这个法西斯措施的。这些教师由于他们提高工资的要求一直得不到傀儡当局的答复而举行了这次罢教。
