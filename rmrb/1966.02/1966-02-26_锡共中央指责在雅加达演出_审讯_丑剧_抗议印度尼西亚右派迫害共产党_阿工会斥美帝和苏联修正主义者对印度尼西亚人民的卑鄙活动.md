　　Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, February 25th – According to news releases published here, the Ceylon Communist Party passed a resolution at its Central Committee meetings held on February 18th and 19th, strongly condemning and protesting the Indonesian right-wing's persecution of the Indonesian Communist Party and progressive individuals.

　　The resolution stated: Indonesian right-wing reactionaries have consistently opposed the progressive political movements in Indonesia, opposed the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-imperialist "Malaysia" policy. They have always secretly colluded with imperialist blocs, especially with US imperialism.

　　The resolution pointed out that Indonesian right-wing reactionaries are using the events of the "September 30th Movement" of 1965 to carry out political persecution against the Indonesian Communist Party and the progressive movement, damaging the good relations that have developed between Indonesia and the People's Republic of China. The resolution also protested the "trial" farce currently being staged in Jakarta under fascist military terror, and demanded the release of all arrested Indonesian Communist Party members and all other progressive individuals. In another resolution it passed, the Ceylon Communist Party Central Committee strongly condemned the actions of the Indonesian right-wing in arresting representatives of the Malayan National Liberation League delegation in Indonesia, and demanded the immediate release of the arrested delegation members. The resolution expressed full support for the Malayan National Liberation League's struggle to smash "Malaysia" and achieve genuine independence for Malaya.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 23rd – The Central Council of Albanian Trade Unions issued a statement on February 22nd, saying that Indonesian reactionary forces, using the September 30th Movement as a pretext, have launched an anti-communist hysteria and implemented medieval terror against democrats and progressive mass organizations. Thousands of workers, trade union activists, and patriots have been arrested, tortured, and brutally beaten to death. The All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions, which enjoys prestige among the broad masses of workers in the country for resolutely carrying out class struggle and anti-imperialist struggle in the interests of the Indonesian revolution and the people, has been disbanded by the right-wing army, and its leaders have been brutally persecuted.

　　The statement said that the Indonesian reactionaries, at the instigation and support of US imperialists and their lackeys, are recently conducting completely fabricated fascist trials of the leaders of the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions and other Indonesian progressives with the aim of covering up their heinous crimes, and attempting to stifle and undermine the Indonesian Communist Party, the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions, and other progressive organizations through this judicial farce, obstruct the Indonesian revolution, and establish a military dictatorship.

　　The statement pointed out that these unspeakable plans orchestrated by the Indonesian reactionaries under the direction of US imperialism are an integral part of the counter-revolutionary global strategy of US imperialism to dominate and exploit the people of other countries, weaken the powerful anti-imperialist front, and suppress the revolutionary and liberation struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

　　The statement said that Albanian workers and their trade union organizations sternly condemn this barbaric act and terrorist activity by the Indonesian right-wing forces, and condemn the conspiracies and despicable activities of the US imperialists and their collaborators, the Khrushchev revisionists, against the freedom-loving Indonesian people. Albanian workers and trade unions are deeply convinced that the revolutionary struggle of Indonesian workers and the heroic people for freedom, independence, sovereignty, democracy, and against imperialism, new and old colonialism, and reactionaries will surely be victorious.

　　The statement demanded that the Indonesian reactionary forces stop their savage suppression of workers, communists, trade union activists, patriots, and progressive organizations, and demanded the immediate restoration of their freedom, democratic liberties, and trade union rights.

    新华社科伦坡二十五日电　根据这里发表的新闻公报，锡兰共产党在二月十八日和十九日举行的中央委员会会议上通过决议，强烈谴责和抗议印度尼西亚右派迫害印度尼西亚共产党和进步人士。
    决议说：印度尼西亚右翼反动分子一向反对印度尼西亚的进步政治运动，反对反帝、反封建和对抗帝国主义的产物“马来西亚”的政策。他们一向同帝国主义集团，特别是同美帝国主义秘密勾结。
    决议指出，印度尼西亚右翼反动分子利用一九六五年
  “九月三十日运动”的事件对印度尼西亚共产党和进步运动进行政治迫害，损害印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国之间已经发展起来的良好关系。决议还抗议在法西斯军事恐怖的情况下，目前正在雅加达演出的“审讯”丑剧，要求释放所有被捕的印度尼西亚共产党党员和其他所有进步人士。锡兰共产党中央委员会在它通过的另一项决议中，强烈谴责印度尼西亚右派逮捕马来亚民族解放同盟驻印度尼西亚代表团代表的行动，并要求立即释放被捕的代表团人员。决议表示完全支持马来亚民族解放同盟粉碎“马来西亚”和争取马来亚真正独立的斗争。
    新华社地拉那二十三日电　阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会二十二日发表声明说，印度尼西亚反动势力以九月三十日运动为借口，发动了反共的歇斯底里，对民主人士及进步群众组织实行了中世纪的恐怖。成千上万的工人、工会积极分子和爱国者被捕被拷打和残酷地被打死。为印度尼西亚革命和人民的利益坚决进行阶级斗争和反帝斗争而在本国广大工人群众中享有威望的全印度尼西亚中央职工会，已经被右派军队解散，其领导人也遭到了野蛮的迫害。
    声明说，印度尼西亚反动派最近在美帝国主义者及其仆从的唆使和支持下，对全印度尼西亚中央职工会的领导人和其他印度尼西亚进步分子进行完全虚构的法西斯审讯的目的是掩盖他们所犯下的滔天罪行，并且力图通过这种审判的滑稽剧，来扼杀和破坏印度尼西亚共产党、全印度尼西亚中央职工会和其他进步组织，阻挠印度尼西亚革命的进程，建立军事独裁制度。
    声明指出，印度尼西亚反动派在美帝国主义的指使下策划的这些不可告人的计划，是美帝国主义统治和剥削其他国家人民，削弱反帝力量的强大阵线以及亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家人民的革命斗争和解放斗争的反革命全球战略的不可分割的一部分。
    声明说，阿尔巴尼亚工人和他们的工会组织严厉谴责印度尼西亚右派势力的这种野蛮行径和恐怖活动，谴责美帝国主义者及其合作者赫鲁晓夫修正主义者对爱好自由的印度尼西亚人民的阴谋和卑鄙活动。阿尔巴尼亚工人和工会深信，印度尼西亚的工人和英勇的人民为争取自由、独立、主权、民主和反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义以及反动派而进行的革命斗争一定会取得胜利。
    声明要求制止印度尼西亚反动势力对工人、共产党人、工会积极分子、爱国者以及进步组织的野蛮镇压，要求立即恢复他们的自由，恢复民主自由和工会权利。
