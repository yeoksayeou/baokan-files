　　Philippine Thousands of People Demonstrate Angrily Expelling Humphrey
　　Humphrey in Strong Philippine People's Protest Sound in Hurriedly Slinking Out of Manila
    Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch from Manila: Thousands of Filipino workers, peasants, and students demonstrated today in front of the American Embassy in Manila, protesting against American aggression in Vietnam and the visit of American Vice President Humphrey to the Philippines to collect cannon fodder.
    Humphrey arrived in the Philippines on this day from New Zealand to conduct a visit, promoting President Johnson's plan, formulated in Honolulu with the heads of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    Demonstrators held torches, waved anti-American placards, and shouted slogans like "Americans, get out!" and "Humphrey, get out!" Their placards read: "Americans are the number one enemy of mankind!", "Execute American war-mongers!", "The murderer Johnson must be hanged!" and "The Peace Corps is an outer organization of the Central Intelligence Agency!" etc.
    On their way to the American Embassy, the demonstrators distributed leaflets condemning American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam.
    Earlier that day, the demonstrators had also held a demonstration in front of the Presidential Palace, protesting against President Marcos's succumbing to American pressure and deciding to send an "engineering battalion" to South Vietnam to work for the United States.
    Leaders of the demonstration also delivered speeches protesting President Marcos's decision.
    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch from Manila: American Vice President Humphrey left Manila for South Korea on the 22nd after inducing Philippine President Marcos to agree to provide cannon fodder for the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    Humphrey arrived in Manila on the 21st amidst strong protests from the Filipino people, and held formal talks with Marcos on the 22nd. Marcos announced at a press conference held after the talks: "I have informed the Vice President (of the United States) of my decision to send an engineering battalion to South Vietnam." He also said that in addition to sending an engineering battalion, he was also willing to send other combat troops to South Vietnam.
    After this matter was announced, a large group of Filipino students held demonstrations in front of the Congress and the Presidential Palace on the 22nd, protesting against the Philippine government's decision to send an engineering battalion to South Vietnam.
    When Humphrey arrived in Manila on the 21st, the airport gate was blocked by demonstrators holding placards with slogans such as "Murderer, get out!" and "Get out of South Vietnam!" Humphrey was quietly escorted away by Philippine police through a back door and took a boat to cross a small river to spend the night in a hotel. Harriman and two American reporters who arrived on the same plane were surrounded by demonstrators. The Associated Press said that Humphrey took the waterway "to avoid traveling by car on the street, because left-wing demonstrators were ambushing on the street." When reporters asked Humphrey about his feelings on the anti-American demonstrations, he shamelessly said: "There are also mass demonstrations in the (United States) domestically." (Attached picture)
    On February 21, thousands of Filipino workers, peasants, and students held a demonstration in front of the American Embassy in Manila, protesting against American aggression in Vietnam and Humphrey's visit to the Philippines to collect cannon fodder. The placard held high by the demonstrators read: "Humphrey, Murderer!" "Americans, Get Out!"

　　菲律宾数千人示威怒逐汉弗莱
　　汉弗莱在菲人民强烈抗议声中匆匆溜出马尼拉
    新华社二十一日讯　马尼拉消息：数千名菲律宾工人、农民和学生今天在马尼拉的美国大使馆前举行示威，抗议美国侵略越南和美国副总统汉弗莱到菲律宾来搜罗炮灰。
    汉弗莱在这一天从新西兰到达菲律宾进行访问，推销约翰逊总统同南越伪政权头目在檀香山拟定的扩大侵越战争的计划。
    示威者举着火把，挥动反美标语牌，高呼“美国佬，滚回去！”“汉弗莱，滚回去！”的口号。他们的标语牌上写着：“美国佬是人类的头号敌人！”，
  “处死美国战争贩子！”，“必须绞死杀人犯约翰逊！”和“和平队是中央情报局的外围组织！”等等。
    示威群众在前往美国大使馆的途中，一路散发了谴责美帝国主义侵略越南的传单。
    这一天早些时候，示威者曾到总统府门前举行了示威，抗议马科斯总统屈从美国的压力决定派一个“工兵营”到南越去为美国卖命。
    示威的领导人还发表了演说，抗议马科斯总统的这个决定。
    据新华社二十二日讯　马尼拉消息：美国副总统汉弗莱二十二日在诱迫菲律宾总统马科斯同意为侵越战争提供炮灰后，离开马尼拉前往南朝鲜。
    汉弗莱二十一日在菲律宾人民的强烈抗议声中到达马尼拉，二十二日和马科斯举行正式会谈。马科斯在会谈后举行的记者招待会上宣布：“我已经把我派工程营去南越的决定通知了（美国）副总统。”他还说，除了派工程营之外，他还愿意派其他作战部队去南越。
    这件事情公布后，一大群菲律宾学生二十二日在国会和总统府门前举行示威，抗议菲律宾政府决定派工程营前往南越。
    汉弗莱二十一日到达马尼拉时，机场大门被高举着“杀人犯滚回去！”“滚出南越！”等标语牌的示威群众挡住。汉弗莱被菲律宾警察悄悄地由后门送走，坐船偷渡小河去宾馆过夜。同机到达的哈里曼和两名美国记者却被示威者包围起来。美联社说，汉弗莱改取水路，“可以避免坐汽车在街上走，因为街上正埋伏着左翼示威者”。当记者问汉弗莱对反美示威的感想时，他居然厚着脸皮说：“在（美国）国内也有群众示威。”（附图片）
