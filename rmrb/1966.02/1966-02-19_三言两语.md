    Brief Comments
    Able to Enter but Unable to Exit
    Taylor, the defeated general of the South Vietnamese people, boasted in a speech that "there is no place in South Vietnam" that the American aggressor troops and South Vietnamese puppet army "cannot enter whenever they want."
    Everyone knows that the current reality is that the US-puppet troops can only entrenched in some isolated strongholds, and are constantly being beaten and bloodied. Isn't Taylor making a laughing stock of himself by bragging like this?
    However, there is some truth in his words. The US-puppet troops always want to "enter," and they can enter some places, but once they enter, they can't get out.
      Wishful Thinking
    According to reports, the United States and its South Vietnamese puppets plan to establish a "highly effective 72,000-strong national police force" to cut off the connection between the South Vietnam Liberation Army and the people.
    What over 500,000 puppet troops and 200,000 American aggressor troops have failed to do, can adding tens of thousands of puppet police accomplish? This is simply wishful thinking. They don't understand that the reason the relationship between the South Vietnam Liberation Army and the South Vietnamese people is like fish and water is not because there are too few puppet police in South Vietnam, but precisely because the police rule of the Saigon puppet regime has driven the people to a dead end.

    三言两语
    进得出不得
    南越人民的手下败将泰勒在一次演说中吹牛说：“南越没有一个地方”不是美国侵略军和南越傀儡军队“什么时候想进去就可以进去的”。
    谁都知道，目前的实际情况是，美伪军只能盘踞着一些孤立据点，而且不断被打得头破血流。泰勒吹这样的牛皮，不是要叫人笑掉牙齿吗？
    不过，他的话也有一半道理。美伪军总是想“进去”，也不是都进不去，但进得去却出不来了。
      异想天开
    据报道，美国和它的南越傀儡打算建立一支“有高度效能的七万二千国家警察部队”，以切断南越解放军同人民的联系。
    五十多万伪军和二十万美国侵略军没有能办到的事情，增添几万傀儡警察就能办得到么？这简直是异想天开。他们不懂得，南越解放军同南越人民的关系之所以有如鱼水，并不是因为南越的伪警察太少，而恰恰是因为西贡傀儡政权的警察统治逼得老百姓无路可走的缘故。
