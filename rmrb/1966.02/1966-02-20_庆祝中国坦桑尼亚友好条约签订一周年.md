    Today marks the first anniversary of the signing of the Friendship Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the United Republic of Tanzania. The Chinese people, with joy, warmly celebrate this memorable day.
    The signing of the China-Tanzania Friendship Treaty is a major event in the history of our two countries' relations, marking a new stage in the friendly cooperation between our two countries.
    The friendship between Tanzania and China is deep and long-standing. As early as over a thousand years ago, the people of our two countries had friendly exchanges. In the years of opposing imperialism and colonialism and striving for national independence and liberation, the people of the two countries sympathized with and supported each other in the struggle. After our two countries gained independence and liberation, this traditional friendship has been further developed. President Nyerere's friendly visit to China last February and Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Tanzania in June opened up new prospects for friendly cooperation between the two countries and brought the friendship between the two peoples to a new peak.
    The rapid development of friendly cooperation between China and Tanzania is not accidental. This is because the people of our two countries have a common historical experience and a common task of struggle; this is because the fruitful cooperation between our two countries fully embodies the spirit of mutual respect, mutual support, and equal treatment; this is because the friendship between our two countries has developed in the common struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism.
    However, imperialism is most afraid of this friendship. In the Congo (Leopoldville) in Africa, in Vietnam in Asia, and in the Dominican Republic in Latin America, American imperialism stretches out its claws of aggression everywhere. American imperialism always carries out its sinful activities under the guise of "defending peace" and "fulfilling its solemn obligations". In order to achieve its goals, American imperialism tries every possible means to disintegrate and undermine the unity of the people of all countries, in order to defeat them one by one and strangle the revolutionary movements of all countries. In recent years, American imperialism has been particularly deliberate in provoking the friendly relations between the Chinese people and the African people. However, the conspiracies and tricks of American imperialism and new and old colonialism will not succeed, and their sinful activities are in vain. The friendly relations between China and Tanzania, the friendly relations between the Chinese people and the African people, cannot be undermined by anyone, and no force in the world can stop the countries and people who uphold unity against imperialism from uniting together.
    The Chinese people have great respect and admiration for the hardworking and brave people of Tanzania. The Tanzanian people have waged unremitting struggles to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty and to oppose imperialist interference and subversion. The Tanzanian people have made remarkable achievements in building and developing the national economy and national culture. The Chinese people sincerely hope that Tanzania will make significant contributions to the anti-imperialist cause and achieve greater success in its construction endeavors.
    The consolidation and development of friendly cooperation between China and Tanzania is not only in the interests of the people of our two countries but also in the interests of Asian-African solidarity and world peace. On the anniversary of the signing of the China-Tanzania Friendship Treaty, we wish the friendship between the people of China and Tanzania to last forever.

### 庆祝中国坦桑尼亚友好条约签订一周年

    庆祝中国坦桑尼亚友好条约签订一周年
    今天，是中华人民共和国和坦桑尼亚联合共和国友好条约签订一周年，中国人民怀着愉快的心情，热烈庆祝这一值得纪念的日子。
    中国和坦桑尼亚友好条约的签订，是我们两国关系史上的重大事件，标志着我们两国的友好合作进入了一个新的阶段。
    坦桑尼亚和中国的友谊是深厚的、悠久的。早在一千多年以前，我们两国人民就有了友好往来。在反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取民族独立和解放的岁月里，两国人民在斗争中相互同情、相互支持。我们两国各自获得独立和解放之后，这一传统的友谊又得到更进一步的发展。去年二月尼雷尔总统对中国的友好访问以及六月间周恩来总理访问坦桑尼亚，为两国友好合作关系打开了新的前景，使两国人民的友谊达到了新的高峰。
    中、坦桑两国友好合作关系的迅速发展，并不是偶然的。这是因为我们两国人民有着共同的历史遭遇，有着共同的斗争任务；这是因为我们两国卓有成效的合作，充分体现了相互尊重、相互支持和平等相待的精神；这是因为我们两国的友谊是在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中发展起来的。
    然而，帝国主义最害怕这种友谊。在非洲的刚果（利）、在亚洲的越南、在拉丁美洲的多米尼加，美帝国主义到处伸出它的侵略魔爪。美帝国主义总是以“保卫和平”、“履行自己庄严的义务”等等为幌子，进行罪恶的活动。为了达到它的目的，美帝国主义千方百计地瓦解和破坏各国人民的团结，以便各个击破，扼杀各国人民的革命运动。近几年来，美帝国主义特别处心积虑地挑拨中国人民和非洲人民的友好关系。但是，美帝国主义和新老殖民主义的阴谋诡计是不能得逞的，它们的罪恶活动是徒劳的。中国和坦桑尼亚两国之间的友好关系，中国人民和非洲人民的友好关系，是任何人也破坏不了的，世界上没有任何势力能够阻挡坚持团结反帝的国家和人民联合在一起。
    中国人民对勤劳勇敢的坦桑尼亚人民十分敬重，十分钦佩。坦桑尼亚人民为维护民族独立和国家主权、反对帝国主义的干涉和颠覆，进行了不懈的斗争。坦桑尼亚人民在建设和发展民族经济和民族文化事业中，取得了显著的成就。中国人民衷心希望坦桑尼亚在反帝事业中作出重大贡献，在建设事业中取得更大成就。
    中国和坦桑尼亚两国友好合作关系的巩固和发展，不仅符合我们两国人民的利益，而且也符合亚非团结和世界和平的利益。在纪念中国和坦桑尼亚友好条约签订一周年的今天，我们祝愿中、坦桑两国人民的友谊万古长青。
