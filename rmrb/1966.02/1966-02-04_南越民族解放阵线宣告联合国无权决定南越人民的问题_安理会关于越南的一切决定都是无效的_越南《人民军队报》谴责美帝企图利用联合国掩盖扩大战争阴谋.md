    South Vietnam National Liberation Front Declares the United Nations Has No Right to Decide the Issue of the South Vietnamese People
    All Decisions of the Security Council Regarding Vietnam Are Invalid
    Vietnamese "People's Army Newspaper" Condemns US Imperialism's Attempt to Use the United Nations to Cover Up its Conspiracy to Expand the War
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 3rd -- According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency: The Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front issued a statement on the 2nd declaring: The United Nations has no right to decide the issue of the South Vietnamese people, and all decisions of the United Nations Security Council regarding Vietnam are invalid.
    The statement pointed out that after the failure of its so-called "peace efforts" farce, US imperialism resumed its air raids on North Vietnam, once again presenting a crude challenge to the Vietnamese people and all peace-loving and just humanity. However, in order to cover up its unjust actions, it requested the convening of the United Nations Security Council, attempting to use this organization to continue spreading its false "peaceful sincerity," slandering the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and distorting the just struggle for national salvation of the South Vietnamese people, in order to serve its conspiracy and actions to escalate and expand the war.
    The statement pointed out that even during the so-called "cessation of bombing of North Vietnam to pave the way for negotiations," US imperialism continued to send aircraft to repeatedly violate the airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent an additional 13,000 American soldiers to South Vietnam, and intensified "sweeps" and massacres, committing many new crimes against the South Vietnamese people. At the same time, the US Air Force has also intensified its bombing of the Laotian liberated areas, instigated Thai and South Vietnamese puppet troops to continuously launch provocative attacks on the border areas of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and actively prepared to escalate and expand the Indochina war. All the above actions of US imperialism exposed the essence of the United States' so-called "peace efforts." US imperialism cannot use the United Nations Security Council to cover up the truth, justify its conspiracies and acts of aggression in South Vietnam, and even less can it force the South Vietnamese people to submit.
    The statement said that the South Vietnam National Liberation Front strongly condemns US imperialism for resuming the bombing of North Vietnam, intensifying its war of aggression against South Vietnam and Laos, and its provocative attacks and sabotage against Cambodia. US imperialism must bear full responsibility for the very serious consequences caused by its actions.
    The statement said that the South Vietnam National Liberation Front resolutely exposes to public opinion US imperialism's conspiracy to intensify its war of aggression against South Vietnam and undermine the Democratic Republic of Vietnam under the guise of the United Nations flag.
    The statement said that the South Vietnam National Liberation Front solemnly declares that the United Nations has absolutely no right to decide the issue of the South Vietnamese people. The South Vietnam National Liberation Front believes that all decisions of the United Nations Security Council regarding Vietnam are invalid and are acts of infringing upon Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity.
    The statement said that the only correct solution to restoring peace in South Vietnam is: US imperialism must withdraw all the troops and weapons of the United States and its lackeys from South Vietnam, remove all US military bases in South Vietnam, and let the South Vietnamese people solve their own internal affairs.
    The statement concluded that if US imperialism refuses to abandon its aggressive ambitions, no matter what barbaric and insidious conspiracies it adopts, it cannot avoid the most shameful and complete defeat.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 3rd -- The Vietnamese "People's Army Newspaper" published a commentary on the 3rd, condemning US imperialism's attempt to use the United Nations to cover up its conspiracy to expand its war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The commentary pointed out that US imperialism is doing this because its intensification of the war of aggression in South Vietnam and the resumption of the bombing of North Vietnam have completely bankrupted its "peace" swindle, placing it in a more isolated position in the world. US imperialism is staging a farce in the United Nations, trying its best to pretend that it still has "peaceful sincerity," attempting to continue to deceive public opinion.
    The commentary said that the more the Washington authorities play this trick, the more clearly it exposes its belligerent face and its helpless and passive predicament.
    The commentary emphasized that the United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue. The basis for resolving the Vietnam issue is the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue,

    南越民族解放阵线宣告联合国无权决定南越人民的问题
    安理会关于越南的一切决定都是无效的
    越南《人民军队报》谴责美帝企图利用联合国掩盖扩大战争阴谋
    新华社河内三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会二日发表声明宣布：联合国无权决定越南南方人民的问题，联合国安全理事会关于越南的一切决定都是无效的。
    声明指出，美帝国主义在它的所谓“和平努力”的丑剧失败之后，恢复了对越南北方的空袭，从而又一次对越南人民和整个爱好和平和正义的人类提出了粗暴的挑战。但是，它为了掩饰自己的非正义行动，又要求召开联合国安全理事会，企图利用这个组织继续散播它虚伪的“和平诚意”，诽谤越南民主共和国政府，歪曲越南南方人民正义的救国斗争，以便为它加剧和扩大战争的阴谋和行动效劳。
    声明指出，就是在所谓“停止轰炸北越为谈判开辟道路”期间，美帝国主义仍继续派飞机一再侵犯越南民主共和国领空，增派一万三千名美国兵到越南南方，并加紧进行“扫荡”和屠杀，对越南南方人民犯下许多新的罪行。同时，美国空军还加紧轰炸老挝解放区，唆使泰国和南越伪军不断对柬埔寨王国的边境地区发动挑衅性进攻，为加剧和扩大印度支那战争积极作准备。美帝国主义的上述一切行动暴露了美国的所谓“和平努力”的实质。美帝国主义不能利用联合国安全理事会来掩盖事实真相，为它在越南南方的阴谋和侵略行动辩解，更不能迫使越南南方人民屈服。
    声明说，越南南方民族解放阵线强烈谴责美帝国主义恢复对越南北方的轰炸、加剧对越南南方和老挝的侵略战争及其对柬埔寨的挑衅进攻和破坏。美帝国主义必须对由于它的行动而引起的十分严重的后果承担全部责任。
    声明说，越南南方民族解放阵线向舆论坚决揭露美帝国主义企图在联合国旗帜的掩护下加紧对越南南方的侵略战争和破坏越南民主共和国的阴谋。
    声明说，越南南方民族解放阵线庄严宣告，联合国根本无权决定越南南方人民的问题。越南南方民族解放阵线认为，联合国安全理事会关于越南的一切决定都是无效的，都是侵犯越南的独立、主权、统一和领土完整的行为。
    声明说，恢复越南南方和平的唯一正确的解决办法是：美帝国主义必须把美国和它的仆从的全部军队和武器撤出越南南方，撤除美国在越南南方的所有军事基地，让越南南方人民自己解决自己的内部事务。
    声明最后说，如果美帝国主义拒绝放弃它的侵略野心，不论它采取什么野蛮的、阴险的阴谋手段，都不能避免最可耻的彻底失败。
    据新华社河内三日电　越南《人民军队报》三日发表评论，谴责美帝国主义企图利用联合国掩盖它扩大侵略越南战争的阴谋。
    评论指出，美帝国主义这样做是因为它加强在越南南方的侵略战争和恢复对越南北方的轰炸，使它的“和平”骗局彻底破产，在世界上陷于更加孤立的境地。美帝国主义在联合国上演丑剧，极力装出还有“和平诚意”的姿态，企图继续欺骗舆论。
    评论说，但是，华盛顿当局越是玩弄这种把戏，就越清楚地暴露出它的好战面目和束手无策的被动困境。
    评论强调指出，联合国根本无权干预越南问题。解决越南问题的基础是一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。
    评论指出，美帝国主义一直控制和利用联合国，把它变成了给美国的侵略行动撑腰的工具。这一次，美国又企图利用联合国来颠倒黑白，掩盖它扩大侵略战争的罪行。
