    The notice from the Communist Party Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region states that Comrade Jiao Yulu has set a model for us in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and a model for serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly. All Party members and cadres, especially leading cadres at the county level and above, must immediately and extensively launch the activity of learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu. In studying Chairman Mao's works, we must take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, examine ourselves, identify shortcomings, and earnestly transform our ideology and improve our work style, striving to become good cadres like Jiao Yulu.
    The notice from the Communist Party Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region requires all cadres, especially members of the leading cores of various departments, commissions, and bureaus directly under the autonomous region and various regional and municipal Party committees, and county Party committees, to take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, conduct self-examination, examine the work of their respective regions and departments, identify shortcomings, establish lofty ambitions, and earnestly improve their work, striving to promote the further revolutionization of each cadre, to realize China's Third Five-Year Plan, and to change the face of Guangxi.
    The notice from the Communist Party Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region states that the most fundamental aspect of learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu is to learn his stance, viewpoints, and methods of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to guide the cause of revolution and construction. Learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu should be an important part of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The notice emphasizes that learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu should be combined with the reality of Tibet, and with one's own ideology, work, and work style, in the spirit of rectification, to identify shortcomings. Through studying, examining, and summarizing the work of one's own region and department, we must grasp the ideological revolutionization of people, especially the ideological revolutionization of leading cadres at the county level and above, transform our ideology, improve our leadership, improve our work, and use Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit to build Tibet and build the frontier.
    The notice from the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee states that learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, in the final analysis, is to learn his deep class feelings, to study Chairman Mao's works at all times and in all matters, to take Chairman Mao's instructions as the highest standard in every word and deed, and to apply the stance, viewpoints, and methods of Mao Zedong Thought to practical work in a unified way. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we must further promote the spirit of hard work and practical work, earnestly stay at selected spots, participate in labor, conduct investigation and research, care about the lives of the masses, closely link with the masses, and strive to realize the revolutionization of the leadership's ideological work style, and promote the socialist education movement and the great production movement that are currently being carried out in depth in our province.
