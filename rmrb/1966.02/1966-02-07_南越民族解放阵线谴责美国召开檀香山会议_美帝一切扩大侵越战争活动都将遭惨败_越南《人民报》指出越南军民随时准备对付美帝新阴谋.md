    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 6th (via Vietnam South Liberation News Agency) – A spokesman for the Foreign Liaison Committee of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front issued a statement on the 6th, strongly condemning the Johnson administration for summoning the Saigon puppets to attend the Honolulu Conference to discuss strengthening and expanding the US war of aggression in South Vietnam.

    The statement pointed out that this special meeting between leaders of the White House and the Pentagon and heads of the Saigon puppet regime is intended to discuss continuing to strengthen and expand the US war of aggression in South Vietnam, while continuing to carry out US deceptive activities with more cunning means to cover up its cruel conspiracies and war actions.

    The statement said that the Honolulu Conference was convened at a time when all US efforts to strengthen its military forces have repeatedly failed, the US "peace efforts" farce has been condemned by world public opinion, and the US lackeys in South Vietnam are seriously at odds, even expressing dissatisfaction with their masters. Another purpose of this meeting is to cheer up the Saigon puppet clique and instigate them to be more active in opposing the people.

    The statement said that Johnson, after ordering US aircraft to resume bombing North Vietnam, convened the South Vietnamese puppet group to discuss strengthening the war against the Vietnamese people. This once again exposed the true face of the so-called "peace efforts" of the United States.

    The statement strongly condemned the above-mentioned illegal collusion between the US aggressors and their servants, the South Vietnamese traitorous clique, and issued a stern warning against their conspiracy to intensify and expand the war of aggression. The statement pointed out that all their activities will only bring them more disastrous failures.

    The statement stated that the people of South Vietnam will never waver in the face of the threats or deceptive actions of US imperialism and its servants. They are determined to carry out their national salvation struggle to the final victory and will surely drive all US aggressors out of South Vietnam.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 6th – Vietnam's "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 6th regarding the meeting in Honolulu between the United States and its Saigon lackeys to plot to strengthen the war of aggression, emphasizing that the Vietnamese military and people are always ready to deal with new US conspiracies, and no matter how much it intensifies the war, it must be defeated.

    The editorial pointed out that this Honolulu Conference was held by the US aggressors in order to cope with the heavy failures they have suffered successively in military and political affairs and to discuss plans for further strengthening the war of aggression.

    The editorial said that in 1965, US imperialism sent 200,000 US troops into South Vietnam to carry out an extremely cruel neo-colonialist war of aggression. However, it not only failed to prevent the sacred patriotic struggle of the Vietnamese people from continuing to develop rapidly, but on the contrary, suffered even more disastrous defeats. The destructive war waged by the United States using its air force against North Vietnam has also been duly punished.

    The editorial said that the more stubbornly the US aggressors continue the war of aggression against Vietnam, the more the anti-American movement of the people of the world and the American people will further develop. Sharp contradictions have also arisen within the US ruling clique due to encountering increasingly greater difficulties.

    The editorial pointed out that the US imperialist "special warfare" against South Vietnam has been completely bankrupt. Its expeditionary forces are deeply mired in the quagmire and are being annihilated more and more. The so-called "superiority" of the US Army and Air Force is being met head-on by the military and civilians of North and South Vietnam. In the world, the United States is more isolated than ever before. Domestically, the movement of the American people against the US ruling clique is also higher than ever. A series of political conspiracies that Johnson has trumpeted to the world have also suffered serious failures. His "unconditional discussions," "fourteen-point plan," "suspension of bombing" and other major deceptions have been exposed one after another by world and American public opinion.

    The editorial pointed out that the United States, in order to save itself from the predicament of the war of aggression against Vietnam, has exhausted all its "magic weapons," including various military and diplomatic means, but each time has added new failures and difficulties. This Honolulu Conference will not have any other result.

    The editorial said that the comprehensive contest between the US aggressors and our people on the military and political fronts over the past year has resulted in our comprehensive victory, and US imperialism has suffered comprehensive defeat. On the battlefield, we have achieved successive victories; on the political front, our just struggle has received the support of the whole world. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's letter to many heads of state on January 24 is receiving very warm support. A movement to aid Vietnam and resist America is developing widely in the world, even in the United States. The US aggressors have been unprecedentedly isolated. The more it intensifies the war of aggression against Vietnam, the more it will be isolated and defeated.

    南越民族解放阵线谴责美国召开檀香山会议
    美帝一切扩大侵越战争活动都将遭惨败
    越南《人民报》指出越南军民随时准备对付美帝新阴谋
    新华社河内六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会发言人六日发表声明，强烈谴责约翰逊政府把西贡傀儡召去参加檀香山会议，讨论加强和扩大美国在越南南方进行的侵略战争。
    声明指出，白宫和五角大楼的领导人同西贡傀儡政权头目之间的这次特别会议是打算讨论继续加强并扩大美国在南越的侵略战争，同时用更加狡猾的手段继续进行美国的欺骗活动，以掩盖它的残酷的阴谋和战争行动。
    声明说，檀香山会议是在美国为加强军事力量所作的一切努力不断遭到失败、美国的“和平努力”丑剧受到全世界舆论的谴责、美国在南越的走狗严重不和，甚至对他们的主子表示不满的时候召开的，这次会议的另一目的是为西贡傀儡集团打气，唆使他们更加积极地反对人民。
    声明说，约翰逊在他下令美国飞机恢复对越南北方轰炸之后，又召集南越傀儡集团讨论加强反对越南人民的战争，这再一次暴露了美国的所谓“和平努力”的真面目。
    声明强烈谴责美国侵略者及其仆从南越卖国集团的上述非法勾结，并且对他们加紧和扩大侵略战争的阴谋提出严正警告。声明指出，他们的一切活动只会给他们带来更惨重的失败。
    声明表示，越南南方人民决不会在美帝国主义及其仆从的威胁或欺骗行动面前动摇，他们决心把他们的救国斗争事业进行到最后胜利，必将把所有的美国侵略者赶出越南南方。
    新华社河内六日电　越南《人民报》六日就美国和它的西贡走狗在檀香山开会策划加强侵略战争发表社论强调指出，越南军民随时准备对付美国的新阴谋，不论它把战争加强到什么程度，都一定要打败它。
    社论指出，这次檀香山会议是美国侵略者为了应付它在军事和政治上的接连遭到惨重失败、商讨进一步加强侵略战争的计划而举行的。
    社论说，在一九六五年，美帝国主义把二十万美军开进越南南方，进行一场极其残酷的新殖民主义的侵略战争。但是，它不仅不能阻挡越南人民的神圣爱国斗争继续迅速发展，相反，却遭到了更加惨重的失败。美国使用空军对越南北方进行的破坏性战争，也遭到了应有的惩罚。
    社论说，美国侵略者越是顽固地继续侵略越南的战争，世界人民和美国人民的反美运动就越进一步发展。美国统治集团内部也由于遇到越来越大的困难而产生尖锐的矛盾。
    社论指出，美帝国主义对越南南方的“特种战争”已经遭到全面破产。它的远征军正深陷泥沼和越来越多地被歼灭。美国陆军和空军的所谓“优势”，正在遭到越南北方和南方军民的迎头痛击。在世界上，美国目前比任何时候都要孤立。在国内，美国人民反对美国统治集团的运动也比任何时候都要高涨。约翰逊向全世界大肆宣扬的一系列政治阴谋也遭到了严重的失败，他的“无条件讨论”、“十四点计划”、“暂停轰炸”等大骗局，接连被世界和美国的舆论所揭穿。
    社论指出，美国为了挽救侵略越南战争的困境，已经用尽了它的一切“法宝”，包括各种军事的和外交的手段，但是，每一次都增加了新的失败和困难。这次檀香山会议，也不会有什么其他结果。
    社论说，过去一年美国侵略者和我国人民之间在军事和政治战线上的全面较量，已经使我们获得全面的胜利，美帝国主义遭到全面的失败。在战场上，我们接连胜利；在政治战线上，我们的正义斗争得到全世界的支持，胡志明主席一月二十四日写给许多国家首脑的信件，正在得到非常热烈的支持。一个援越抗美运动正在世界、甚至在美国广泛地开展起来。美国侵略者遭到空前的孤立。它越是加强侵越战争，就越要遭到更大的孤立和失败。
