Title: What Difference Does a Name Change Make?

    The American aggressors have renamed their much-publicized "Operation Masher" as "Operation White Wing." Perhaps it's because their "Masher" was smashed by the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces as soon as it was deployed, and they felt the name was unlucky.

    Engels has a famous saying: "If you classify a shoe brush and a mammal together, the shoe brush will not grow mammary glands as a result." If the United States changes "Masher" to "White Wing," can it avoid defeat? It can only change "being smashed" to "being defeated and fleeing."

### 易名又如何？

    易名又如何？
    美国侵略者把它大事宣扬的“捣碎机攻势”易名为“白翼攻势”。大概是因为他们的“捣碎机”一出动就被南越人民武装所捣碎，觉得名字不吉利之故罢。
    恩格斯有句名言：“如果把鞋刷子和哺乳动物列为一类，鞋刷子并不会因此就长出乳腺来。”美国把“捣碎机”改名为“白翼”，难道就能避免失败吗？只能是把“被捣碎”改称做“铩羽”罢了。
