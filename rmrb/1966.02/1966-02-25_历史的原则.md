　　History's Principles
    U.S. President Johnson delivered a speech in New York touting his policy of aggression against Vietnam, while seven thousand members of the public held a grand anti-war demonstration outside the venue, demanding that U.S. troops withdraw from South Vietnam. The demonstrating masses held high the flags of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, and shouted slogans against the war of aggression against Vietnam. What a magnificent picture! Johnson, intimidated by the power of the masses, could only sneak in and out through a side door under police "protection". What an embarrassing spectacle!
    In the United States, the truly powerful force is not the American reactionaries, but the American people. People can see this very clearly from here.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said when discussing just and unjust wars: "If the purpose of war directly represents the interests of the people, the more democratic the government, the better the war will proceed. Such a government should not fear the people opposing the war; on the contrary, what this government should worry about is the people not rising up and their indifference to the war. The nature of the war determines the relationship between the government and the people; this is a historical principle." Today, the relationship between the Johnson government and the American people is one of complete opposition. The war of aggression against Vietnam is an unjust war that violates the interests of the American people. Therefore, Johnson naturally cannot help but be terrified by the rising tide of the American people's anti-war movement. Johnson even talks grandly about the so-called traditions of "democracy" and "freedom," attempting to make people believe that the war of aggression against Vietnam has broad support within the United States. How can this deceive anyone? Johnson is doing everything possible to alleviate opposition to his aggressive policies within the United States and to curb the anti-war struggle of the broad masses. However, all his efforts are obviously in vain. No one can change this historical principle pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong.

　　历史的原则
    美国总统约翰逊在纽约发表演说鼓吹侵越政策，七千名公众在会场外举行了盛大的反战示威，要求美军撤出南越。示威群众高举着越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，高呼反对侵越战争的口号。这是多么壮丽的图景呵！约翰逊慑于群众的威力，只能在警察的“保护”下灰溜溜地打边门出入。这又是多么狼狈的丑态呵！
    在美国，真正有力量的，不是美国反动派，而是美国人民。人们从这里也可以看得很清楚。
    毛泽东同志在谈到正义战争和非正义战争的时候说过：“如果战争的目的是直接代表着人民利益的时候，政府越民主，战争就越好进行。这样的政府就不应畏惧人民反对战争，相反，这个政府所顾虑的，应是人民的不起来和对于战争的冷淡。战争的性质决定政府和人民的关系，这是一个历史的原则。”今天，约翰逊政府同美国人民之间的关系，就是一种完全对立的关系。侵越战争是违背美国人民利益的非正义战争，因此，约翰逊就自然不能不对美国人民反战运动的日益高涨怕得要死。约翰逊居然还大谈所谓“民主”、“自由”的传统，力图要人相信侵越战争在美国国内是得到广泛支持的。这又怎么能骗得了人呢？约翰逊正在竭力想方设法缓和美国国内对其侵略政策的反对，遏止广大人民的反战斗争。但是，他的一切努力显然都是徒劳的。任何人都不可能改变毛泽东同志所指出的这一历史的原则。
