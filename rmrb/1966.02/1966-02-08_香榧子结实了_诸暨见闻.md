    Chinese torreya is a relatively precious local product. Chinese torreya is not produced in many places. In Zhejiang Province, the Chinese torreya from Fengqiao District, Zhuji County, is more well-known, and in the Fengqiao area, Zhongjialing Brigade of Dongxi Commune has the largest output. The Chinese torreya tree is a biennial fruit tree, and the life of a tree can reach a thousand years, but the growing period is very slow, requiring about thirty years to mature and bear fruit. Perhaps it is because things are valued when they are rare, so people also call the Chinese torreya tree the "ten-thousand-year flower and fruit."
    Unfortunately, before liberation, farmers could not control the fate of this "ten-thousand-year flower and fruit." For thousands of years, they were allowed to grow and perish on their own. Some trees did not bear fruit for years, even decades, and some trees bore very little fruit even when they did. The maturation of the Chinese torreya was uncertain, and the "ten-thousand-year flower and fruit" became withered and rotten fruit, and people had lost interest in it.
    After liberation, the Chinese torreya trees were protected and valued by the government, and the old farmers put their efforts into the Chinese torreya trees again, but the output of Chinese torreya was still unstable.
    In 1958, a young man named Tang Zhongxun came from the Department of Biology (Botany Major) of Peking University. He volunteered to go to the countryside to get experience, and taught in a part-farming, part-study private middle school in Dongxi Commune. Once, he learned from a student that the Chinese torreya production was low, and the people in the mountains were hoping for a good harvest. So he buried a wish in his heart: to go up the mountain and uncover the secret of why the Chinese torreya did not bear fruit.
    He often used his holidays to travel more than ten miles of mountain roads to the Zhongjialing Brigade in the high mountains to study the Chinese torreya. He met several farmers who were interested in Chinese torreya, asked them about the knowledge of Chinese torreya, and learned from their management experience. He ran all over the mountains during the day and stayed in the homes of the farmers at night. Later, he was transferred to work in the county seat, farther away from the mountains, but he never forgot the Chinese torreya trees on the mountain, never forgot the wishes of the people in the mountains, and never forgot to dedicate his knowledge to the farmers. Whenever he had a chance, he would still run up the mountain and study with the farmers. After several years, he and the farmers discovered that the main reason why the Chinese torreya trees did not bear fruit was that there were few male trees (many people thought that male Chinese torreya did not bear fruit anyway, so they cut them down for use), and female Chinese torreya trees must be pollinated when the male Chinese torreya trees bloom in order to produce high yields. After many experiments, they proved that artificial pollination was effective. A Chinese torreya tree that had not borne fruit for more than sixty years produced more than 150 jin of Chinese torreya after pollination. From 1962, Tang Zhongxun led everyone to carry out artificial pollination for the Chinese torreya trees, and as a result, there were good harvests every year. The masses in the nearby mountains came to learn this new experience. Teacher Tang's name spread in the mountains. The people in the mountains wanted him to stay on the mountain for a long time, and he was willing to stay on the mountain to continue studying the production of Chinese torreya, but unfortunately his job was in the county seat, and every time he reluctantly walked down the mountain. "When can Teacher Tang be left on the mountain?..." The old farmers discussed this matter whenever they met.
    Last May, the county party secretary came to the Zhongjialing Brigade, which is six or seven hundred meters above sea level. When he saw the Chinese torreya trees all over the mountain, the poor and lower-middle peasants told him: "Now it's almost the season for pollinating the Chinese torreya trees, it would be great if Teacher Tang could come up the mountain..." Zhongjialing was the fifth brigade he visited in Dongxi Commune, and it was also the fifth time he heard the poor and lower-middle peasants make this request to him. In the first two brigades, he replied to the poor and lower-middle peasants: "Okay, let us consider this issue." In the third and fourth brigades, the county party secretary had already made up his mind. Now that the poor and lower-middle peasants had made the request again, he immediately decided: Please Comrade Tang Zhongxun put down his work in the county and come up the mountain immediately!
    When the young man received the notice to go up the mountain, he was overjoyed, and that night he rushed to the commune. The county party secretary had a long talk with him under the lamp. Finally, he said to the young man: "You can settle down on the mountain. You can get the trust of the poor and lower-middle peasants, this is the greatest honor. You must humbly continue to study the increase in production of Chinese torreya together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. I congratulate you on quickly flying from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom in the research of Chinese torreya!"
    When I arrived at Zhongjialing, Comrade Tang Zhongxun took me to see the Chinese torreya trees all over the mountain, and I met many farmers in the mountains, who greeted him warmly: "Teacher Tang!" From their expressions of gratification and pride, I seemed to hear people saying in their hearts: "Teacher Tang was transferred here by our county party secretary himself."

### 香榧子结实了——诸暨见闻

    香榧子结实了
    ——诸暨见闻
    姜德明
    香榧子是一种比较名贵的土产。香榧子的产地不多，浙江省以诸暨县枫桥区的较闻名，而枫桥地区又以东溪公社钟家岭大队的产量较多。香榧树是两年生的果树，一棵树的寿命可达千年，但生长期却很慢，需要三十年左右才能长成结实。也许是物以稀为贵吧，所以人们又称香榧树为“万年花果”。
    可惜，在解放以前，农民还不能掌握这“万年花果”的命运，千百年来都是让它自生自灭，有的树连年，甚至十几年、几十年不结实，有的树虽结实却很少。香榧成熟无期，“万年花果”变成了残年败果，人们对它已经失去了兴趣。
    解放后，香榧树得到政府的保护和重视，老农们重又在香榧树上下了功夫，可是香榧产量还不稳定。
    一九五八年，从北京大学生物系植物专业来了一位年青人，他的名字叫汤仲壎。他是自愿到农村来锻炼的，就在东溪公社的一个半农半读的民办中学里教书。有一次他偶然地从学生那里知道了香榧子低产，山里人都盼着它丰收。于是他埋下了一个愿望：上山去揭开香榧子不结实的秘密。
    他常常利用假期，跑十几里的山路，到高山上的钟家岭大队去研究香榧子。他结识了几位对香榧子有兴趣的农民，向他们请教了香榧子的知识，学习他们的管理经验。白天跑遍了群山，夜里就住在农民的家里。后来，他被调到县城去工作，离开山上更远了，但是他始终没有忘记山上的香榧树，没有忘记山里人的心愿，没有忘记把自己的知识献给农民。一有机会，他还是跑上山来和农民一起研究。经过几年的时间，他和农民一起发觉了香榧树不结实，主要是雄树少（很多人认为反正雄榧不结实，便把它们砍掉使用了），而雌榧树必须在雄榧开花时经过授粉才能高产。他们经过多次试验，证明人工授粉办法是有效的。有棵香榧树六十几年不结实了，经过授粉以后，竟产了一百五十多斤香榧子。从一九六二年起，汤仲壎就带领大家给香榧树搞人工授粉，结果年年丰收，附近山里的群众纷纷来学习这套新经验。汤老师的名字便这样在山里传开了。山里人愿他长期留在山上，他也愿意留在山上继续研究香榧子生产，可惜他的工作岗位在县城，每次他都依依不舍地走下山去。“什么时候能把汤老师留在山上呢？……。”老农们见了面就合计着这件事。
    去年五月间，县委书记同志来到了这拔海六七百米的钟家岭大队。当他看到这遍山香榧树的时候，贫下中农们向他表示：“现在又快到香榧树授粉的季节了，汤老师能上山来就好了……。”钟家岭是他在东溪公社访问的第五个大队了，也是他第五次听到贫下中农对他提出了这一要求。在第一二个大队里，他回答贫下中农们说：“好，让我们考虑一下这个问题。”在第三四个大队里，县委书记的心里已经盘算好了。如今贫下中农又一次提出了要求，他马上决定：请汤仲壎同志放下县里的工作，即刻上山来！
    年青人在山下得到上山的通知，真是喜出望外，就在当天夜里他赶到了公社。县委书记在灯下和他作了一次长谈。最后，他对年青人说：“你就在山上安家吧。你能得到贫下中农的信任，这是最大的荣誉。你要虚心地和贫下中农一起继续研究香榧子的增产。我祝贺你在香榧的研究上很快地从必然的王国，飞向自由的王国！”
    当我到了钟家岭上，汤仲壎同志带着我去看遍山的香榧树的时候，碰到了许多山中农民，都亲热地跟他打招呼：“汤老师！”从他们那种欣慰和骄傲的表情上，我好象听到人们的心里在说：“汤老师是我们县委书记亲自给调来的呢。”
