    Why I Can't Go Deep into the Grassroots Communist Youth League
    Wei Mingshen, Deputy Secretary of the Penglai County Committee, Shandong

    Our county has 588 Youth League branches. In recent years, I've only visited about 15% of them. I'm young and strong, full of energy, so why have I visited so few? And within that "few," I even less frequently visit the Youth League branches that are lagging behind or facing difficulties. My so-called frequent visits to the grassroots only involve going to familiar, smooth-sailing, and active places. I used to be satisfied with this situation, but why? Using Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror to examine myself, I realize that I lack Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary spirit of not fearing hardship or death. At such a young age, I rely on listening to reports to guide work, living off "chewing other people's leftovers." What will become of me in the future? It seems that I must undergo a revolution. When "I" is in my mind, my actions will inevitably be "lazy," and I will inevitably be unproductive for the revolution. I must honestly learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, be a complete and thorough revolutionary, and diligently serve the people. Insist on Conducting In-Depth Investigation and Research Su Guanghua, Deputy Manager of Nanjing Coal Construction Company
    Comrade Jiao Yulu possessed both the revolutionary courage to conquer nature and the pragmatic style of proceeding from reality. He followed Chairman Mao's teachings, insisted on conducting in-depth investigation and research, and personally grasped first-hand information. He said, "Chewing other people's leftovers has no flavor." His working style of combining revolutionary vigor with scientific spirit is worth learning from.
    Our Coal Construction Company is a unit responsible for supplying fuel. Under the leadership of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee, we have also done some work and achieved some results in supporting industrial production. Therefore, I thought I had a good grasp of the situation of the factories, so I rarely went down anymore. The comrades below also gradually stopped conducting investigation and research. This year, we launched an increase production and practice economy movement. The first-quarter coal figures proposed by industrial units exceeded the planned supply. Under these circumstances, I and other comrades visited 144 coal-using units for investigation and discovered that we were completely "groping in the dark" while sitting in the office. Some units, due to the thinking of being generous in estimating demand, requested more coal, and because we had no clear understanding, we gave them too much, resulting in coal stockpiles. Some units truthfully reported the amount of coal needed, but because our understanding was insufficient, we were afraid of oversupplying and failed to allocate all of it to them. There were also units whose coal types changed due to changes in production tasks, but because we lacked understanding, we sometimes couldn't meet their needs. After investigation and research, accurately grasping first-hand information, and conducting surplus and shortage adjustments, we vigorously promoted coal conservation and solved the gap without increasing the total supply, thereby supporting production. This investigation deeply educated me that production is constantly developing and the situation is constantly changing. To support production, we must constantly go to production units to understand the situation. Especially as a leader, I must personally go to the front line. Only in this way can I have a say in decision-making. Any complacency is unfounded.
    I realized that to conduct investigation and research like Comrade Jiao Yulu, one must first diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, transform one's thinking, always consider the interests of the people, put the interests of the people first, not seek fame or profit, not fear hardship or death, and dedicate oneself to the revolution and wholeheartedly serve the people. Only in this way can we delve into reality and do arduous work.

    为什么我不能深入基层共青团
    山东蓬莱县委副书记　魏明深
    我们县有五百八十八个团支部，几年来，自己去过的不过百分之十五左右；自己年轻力壮，能蹦能跳，为什么跑得这么少？而且在这个“少”字当中，更少到工作落后和困难的团支部去。所谓常下基层，只不过是到一些熟门顺道，工作活跃的地方跑跑。对这种情况，过去竟心满意足，为什么呢？用焦裕禄同志做镜子照照自己，是自己脑子里少了毛泽东思想，少了不怕苦不怕死的革命精神。自己这么年青就靠听汇报指导工作，就靠“吃别人嚼过的馍”过日子，以后怎么得了。看起来，非给自己来个革命不行。头脑里有“我”，行动上必然是“懒”，必然对革命无所作为。我一定要老老实实地向焦裕禄同志学习，做一个完全、彻底的革命者，勤勤恳恳地为人民服务。坚持深入调查研究南京市煤建公司副经理　苏广华
    焦裕禄同志既有敢于战胜自然的革命胆略，又有一切从实际出发的扎扎实实的作风。他按照毛主席的教导办事，坚持深入调查研究，亲自掌握第一手资料，他说：“吃别人嚼过的馍没味道。”他这种革命干劲和科学精神相结合的工作作风，值得我们很好学习。
    我们煤建公司是一个负责供应燃料的单位。在中共南京市委领导下，我们也做了一些工作，对支持工业生产也取得了一些成绩。因此，我就认为对工厂的情况基本上摸得差不多了，自己就很少再下去。下面的同志，也随着不大调查研究了。今年开展了增产节约运动，工业单位提出来的第一季度要煤数字，超过了计划供应的数字。在这种情况下，我和其他同志分别到一百四十四个用煤单位调查访问，这才发现，我们原来坐在机关里完全是“瞎子摸鱼”。有的单位因为有宽打窄用的思想，多要煤炭，由于我们心中无数，就多给了，造成煤炭积压；有的单位实事求是地报了需要煤炭数，由于我们了解情况不够，深怕供应过头，没有能全部拨给他们；也有的单位，由于生产任务变化，煤种也有了变化，由于我们不够了解，有时也不能满足需要。经过调查研究，切实掌握第一手资料，进行余缺调剂，大搞节约用煤，在没有增加供应总量的情况下，解决了差额，支持了生产。这次调查深深地教育了我，生产是不断发展的，情况是不断变化的，要支持生产，就要不断地到生产单位去摸清情况。特别是作为一个领导，更要亲自上第一线，只有这样，才能在决策的时候有发言权。任何自满情绪都是没有根据的。
    我体会到：要象焦裕禄同志那样作调查研究，首先就要象焦裕禄同志那样认真活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想，处处想到人民的利益，把人民的利益放在第一位，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民。只有这样，才能深入实际做艰苦的工作。
