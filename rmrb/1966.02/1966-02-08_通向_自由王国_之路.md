    Everything in the world is a unity of opposites, which is the fundamental principle of materialist dialectics. Things always develop through the contradictory aspects of mutual connection and mutual struggle, and the correct and incorrect in work are also like this. The idea that errors can be completely avoided, that there can only be correctness and no errors, essentially denies the objective law of the unity of opposites, and is therefore a metaphysical viewpoint. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Without experience, it is difficult to avoid making mistakes. There is a process from inexperience to experience." He also said: "We have taken many detours. But mistakes are often the forerunners of correctness."
    How can mistakes become the forerunners of correctness? It is necessary to correctly summarize historical experience. If we do not make a correct summary of historical experience, it will be difficult to distinguish what is successful from what is wrong, and therefore it will be impossible to recognize the origins and development of things, and of course it will be impossible to use historical experience to guide current work and movements actively and correctly. The situations in Taigu County and Qin County become very clear once they are analyzed and compared. The main reason why Taigu County has been able to continue its leap forward is that the leading cadres of the county have seriously summarized the experiences and lessons of their work in the previous years, affirmed their achievements, corrected their mistakes, distinguished right from wrong, and clarified their direction, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the cadres and the masses has become increasingly high. The reason why the work of Qin County has stagnated for a long time, and even regressed at one point, is mainly because the leading cadres there did not distinguish between right and wrong and rashly threw away the correct and the wrong things together. In 1965, when they recognized this point and correctly summarized their historical experience, their work became active and various productions increased significantly as a result. These facts eloquently illustrate that whether or not we can use the dialectical method of "one divides into two" to correctly summarize historical experience is a major issue related to whether or not the work of a county can move forward.
    Why couldn't the comrades in Qin County correctly treat historical experience in the previous years? Why did they become dispirited or even lose their direction when there were some deviations and problems in their work? There is an extremely important point here that has not been well understood, that is, how to view the historical experience of the revolutionary cause: treat it with a revolutionary sense of responsibility, or simply treat it as the gains and losses of certain leading cadres? If it is the former, we can calmly use the method of "one divides into two" to analyze problems, carry forward our strengths, overcome our shortcomings, and continuously promote the revolutionary cause forward; if it is the latter, we will inevitably be worried, just as the comrades in Qin County checked: up, down, left, and right are all bound by the word "dare not," fearing this and fearing that, and the "fear" ultimately boils down to the word "I." This "I" refers to personal gains and losses. Individualistic things are roadblocks in the socialist revolution and construction cause. Without removing them, it is impossible to move forward; removing them will lead to great progress. Doesn't the great change in Qin County in 1965 powerfully illustrate this point?
    Comrade Mao Zedong has always taught us to attach importance to summarizing experience. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have constantly summarized historical experience to lead the revolutionary movement of our people from one victory to another. Our cause is a great and brand-new cause of liberating all mankind, and it is inevitable that some errors will occur in our work. As long as we follow Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings: practice - summary - re-practice - re-summary, repeatedly, we can make our revolution and construction cause gradually leap from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom.
    Correctly summarizing historical experience is the only way to the "realm of freedom."

    通向“自由王国”之路
    世上万事万物都是对立的统一，这是唯物辩证法的根本原理。事物总是由矛盾着的两个侧面，互相联系又互相斗争而得到发展的，工作中的正确和错误也是如此。那种认为错误完全可以避免，可以只有正确，没有错误，实质上是否认了对立统一这个客观规律，因而是形而上学的观点。毛泽东同志教导我们：“没有经验，就难免要犯错误。从没有经验到有经验，要有一个过程。”他还说：“我们走过了许多弯路。但是错误常常是正确的先导。”
    错误怎样才能成为正确的先导？就是要正确地总结历史经验。如果我们不对历史经验作出正确的总结，就难于分清什么是成功的东西，什么是错误的东西，因而也就不可能认清事物发展的来龙去脉，当然也就无法运用历史经验，能动地、正确地指导当前的工作和运动了。太谷县和沁县的情况，一经分析比较，就看得很分明。太谷县之所以能够持续跃进，主要原因是这个县的领导干部认真地总结了前几年工作中的经验和教训，肯定成绩，修正错误，分清是非，明确方向，干部和群众的革命干劲越来越高涨；沁县的工作之所以长时期停滞不前，甚至一度倒退，主要原因是那里的领导干部不分正确和错误，轻率地把正确和错误的东西一起抛掉。一九六五年，当他们认识到这一点，并且正确地总结了历史经验，那里的工作就活跃起来，各项生产因此大幅度上升。这些事实雄辩地说明，能不能用一分为二的辩证方法，正确地总结历史经验，是关系到一个县的工作能不能向前迈步的重大问题。
    沁县的同志们前几年为什么不能正确对待历史经验，为什么在工作中出了一点偏差和毛病，就精神不振甚至迷失了方向呢？这里有一个极其重要的观点没有很好地认识，那就是如何看待革命事业的历史经验：是以革命事业心去对待，还是单纯地作为某些领导干部个人的得失去对待？是前者，就能够冷静地运用一分为二的方法去分析问题，发扬优点，克服缺点，把革命事业不断地向前推进；是后者，必然忧心忡忡，正象沁县同志所检查的：上下左右都被“不敢”两字所束缚，怕这怕那，而“怕”字归结到底是个“我”字。这个“我”字，就是个人的得失。个人主义的东西，是社会主义革命和建设事业上的拦路虎，不除它，寸步难行；除掉它，就大步前进。一九六五年沁县的大变化，不就有力地说明了这一点吗？
    毛泽东同志历来教导我们要重视总结经验。党中央和毛泽东同志就是不断地进行历史经验的总结，来领导我国人民的革命运动，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。我们的事业是解放全人类的伟大的崭新的事业，工作中出现一些错误是难免的。我们只要按照毛泽东同志的教导：实践—总结—再实践—再总结，多次反复，就可以使我们的革命和建设事业，逐步地由必然王国飞跃到自由王国。
    正确总结历史经验，这是通往“自由王国”的必由之路。
