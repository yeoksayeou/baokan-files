    On the banks of the Yangtze River, at the foot of Mount Tu, stands a Daqing-style enterprise known throughout the country for its adherence to running enterprises diligently and frugally: the Chongqing Nan’an Leather Factory.
    For more than ten years, under the leadership of the Party, this factory has gradually developed from a small production cooperative composed of unemployed shoemakers at the time of liberation into a local state-owned factory producing 200,000 pairs of leather shoes annually; from simple tools such as awls and hammers brought by workers when they joined the factory, it has developed to own hundreds of efficient machines and equipment; from relying on state loans or advance payments from state-owned enterprises to maintain production, it has developed to pay tens of thousands of yuan in profits to the state every year…
    However, when you enter this factory, you will find that the factory office is still the old renovated civilian house that was bought before, the interior still has the old wooden tables and stools from the early days of the cooperative, the factory's more than 20 cadres still have thick calluses on their hands, and the "saving sieve" used since the cooperative period to hold scraps of leather remains in the workshop…. The Nan’an Leather Factory's spirit of hard work and entrepreneurship, its thrifty and frugal traditional style, and its proletarian revolutionary nature have not only been maintained but have also been further developed.

    Not Dropping the "Low Stool"
    The cadres of this factory have a saying: "We come from sitting on low stools."
    Shoemaking workers all produce while sitting on low stools. Cadres not forgetting the low stool means not forgetting their roots, not forgetting their class, and not forgetting the vast number of class brothers.
    In the past, they spent arduous years on low stools alongside the workers. Now, some of them have become secretaries and factory directors, but they still work half a day and participate in production labor half a day. For more than ten years, the cadres have not abandoned this low stool that closely links them to the workers. In the most recent fifteen months of implementing the "three fix and one top" labor system, the factory's twenty-four cadres have personally made 2,036 pairs of leather shoes and 8,507 pairs of leather "straw sandals." They have not only not forgotten their shoemaking skills, but one-third of them have reached the production level of advanced workers.
    In the early days of the cooperative, to create production conditions, cadres took the lead in digging foundations, carrying mud, and moving wood with the workers to build factory buildings. Today, the conditions are very different from before, but cadres are still holding hoes, carrying shoulder poles, leading everyone to build dormitories, build ball fields, and cultivate wasteland on the hillside to grow vegetables, improving their lives with their own hands. To save production costs, cadres often use their spare time to transport raw materials from places more than ten miles away.
    During the entrepreneurial period, to overcome difficulties in production, cadres took the lead in everything, setting an example and leading the masses to do a good job in production. Now that production has developed, cadres are still the same as before, bearing hardship before enjoyment. They have set a principle for themselves: anything beneficial must be for the workers first, then the cadres, and then the leaders. The family members of cadres who originally lived outside the factory still live outside the factory. Although the factory has built some dormitories, they are first assigned to the workers. Hu Jianhua, the current Party Branch Secretary, has been a cadre for almost ten years and still lives in a collective dormitory with single workers, intimately.
    Although the factory has developed, cadres always treat rich days as poor days and never have any special requests. The offices of the secretary and factory director still have those old tables and hard benches. Cadres on business trips always save as much as possible on travel and accommodation expenses. Once, Factory Director Wang Shubei went on a business trip to Shanghai to purchase a batch of materials for making leather shoes. He stayed in Shanghai for five nights, all spent in a bathhouse where accommodation was available. This is the true color of the working class being masters of their own affairs. Such cadres are the most valuable asset in socialist enterprises. The workers all say: We can trust such cadres.

    Remembering the "Family Treasure"
    More than 90% of the workers at the Nan’an Leather Factory are old workers who started this enterprise. As the business has prospered and production has developed, the revolutionary spirit of hard work, entrepreneurship, diligence and frugality of the old leather craftsmen has been passed down.
    In 1954, old material cutter Liao Shuquan picked up scraps of leather left over from cutting materials and small pieces of leather that others had scattered on the ground, placing them in a bamboo sieve, to be matched and selected for use at any time, saving whole pieces of leather. This sense of responsibility as masters of the country, cherishing state property, quickly triggered a chain reaction among the workers. Soon, every material cutter had such a bamboo sieve by their side. From then on, no matter how big or small, good or bad, scraps of leather on the ground could not be seen. The workers called this bamboo sieve the "saving sieve." In 1959, relevant leading departments in Chongqing held an on-site meeting at this factory. Some people thought that the "saving sieve" looked bad in the workshop and suggested putting it away. However, the old workers disagreed. They said, "Diligence and frugality are the foundation of our factory. Abolishing the 'saving sieve' means forgetting our roots." In this way, the atmosphere of diligence and frugality, along with the "saving sieve," has been maintained year after year. According to statistics from the past three years alone, the workers have used the scraps of leather in the "saving sieve" to make more than 14,500 pairs of leather casual shoes, leather "straw sandals," and more than 44,300 leather accessories, increasing the country's income by more than 44,000 yuan.
    Inspired by the "saving sieve," material cutter Li Shaoyun changed from using lead cores to iron pens for cutting materials, in order to save every bit of leather. Old worker Yu Liangxing salvaged waste nails from the sewage ditch, day after day. The workers started from these small things and carried out "eight ones" of saving activities, trying every means to save a penny's worth of leather, a dime's worth of sole leather, an inch of thread, a nail, a cent, a minute, a degree of electricity, and a drop of glue.
    Is this just a penny's worth of leather, an inch of thread? No, this is precisely the revolutionary spirit that has remained unchanged for more than ten years of these old leather craftsmen. Today, taking pride in saving and shame in wasting has become the fashion in this factory.

    Happy to Have Successors
    As production has developed, batches of young people have entered the factory. The old workers of the Nan’an Leather Factory, with deep revolutionary feelings, are concerned about the growth of the younger generation. The Party branch selected the factory's most outstanding master craftsmen to be the guides for the young workers. The master craftsmen passed on their exquisite skills to them, and also passed on the excellent qualities of the working class to them.
    This factory has such a tradition that on the first day a new worker joins the factory, the leaders use the factory's history of hard work, self-reliance, diligence and frugality as a profound class education lesson to educate the new workers, so that they consciously become good successors to the revolution and take up the heavy burden of the revolution.
    Three years ago, such a thing happened here: A girl from a worker's family named Li Faqiong originally wanted to be a textile worker, tying a snow-white apron next to a textile machine and weaving fabrics of various colors. However, after she graduated from technical school, she was assigned to the leather factory. She was disappointed, thinking: What's the point of making things worn on the feet?
    A pair of shoe uppers could be made so symmetrical, even, and smooth in the hands of the master, but Li Faqiong sometimes did not do well, and some leather was wasted. Master craftsman and Communist Party member Wu Suihe taught Li Faqiong, saying, "As long as we have the idea of serving the people, what shoes can't we make well? Making shoes is a revolutionary division of labor. We shoemakers must have revolutionary aspirations and make every piece of leather into high-quality leather shoes." Some workers said, "Which inch of cowhide isn't dripping with the sweat of the working people? How can we casually produce defective products!" "We make leather shoes for the people, and we have no right to waste every inch of leather and every thread."
    With the help of leaders and old workers, Li Faqiong gradually understood the principle that making shoes is also doing revolution. Now, she has become an excellent shoemaker. For more than two years, she has never produced a single defective product. When someone asks her where she works, she proudly replies, "I make leather shoes at the Nan’an Leather Factory!"
    Young material cutter Luo Dongliang was also careless when cutting materials three years ago. Others asked him why he didn't calculate carefully before cutting. He retorted, "Such a big factory, the warehouse is piled with leather like a small mountain, what's the use of this little bit?" Later, he saw that his master Cao Zixiang often racked his brains to explore the most economical cutting method, forgetting to eat and sleep. The master said, "To build socialism, we must be meticulous and make revolution at a distance of a cent." Luo Dongliang felt uneasy after hearing his master's words. He was determined to take his master as an example and link saving every penny of leather with building socialism. Last year, they, master and apprentice, made revolution from a penny of leather. Each of them saved more than 100 square meters of surface leather, equivalent to the material for more than 1,100 pairs of men's leather shoes, and became the factory's famous "red pair."
    At the Nan’an Leather Factory, there are such "red pairs" in every workshop and every group.

    Making Shoes for the Revolution
    Two years ago, the Nan’an Leather Factory conducted an unusual political study test. The question was: Why do you make leather shoes?
    The workers' answer was: For the revolution.
    Making leather shoes for the revolution! This glorious idea has generated immeasurable power in the factory, in the workshop, and on every low stool.
    Making leather shoes for the revolution, being a revolutionary leather craftsman, this is a yardstick in the hearts of Nan’an people. For more than ten years, they have used this yardstick to clarify right and wrong, clarify the direction, and steadily move forward.
    When the factory changed from small to large, from poor to rich, from a cooperative to a state-owned factory, some people felt that production had developed and a state-owned factory should look like a state-owned factory, and wanted to compare with others in terms of grandeur and pomp. However, the factory leaders who came from old leather craftsmen proposed another standard of comparison, which is: compare contributions to the country, compare service to the people, and compare the idea of running enterprises diligently and frugally.
    At one point, some people advocated polishing and shining low-quality leather shoes, applying more shoe polish, and selling them as high-quality leather shoes. This matter aroused strong opposition from the workers, and they raised a serious question:
    "Do we produce leather shoes to make money? Or to serve the people?"
    "To be a revolutionary leather craftsman, we must be honest and wholeheartedly serve the people." This is their answer.
    Nan’an workers think this way and do this way.
    In the factory, in the countryside, at the station, and at the dock, they carry picture albums, hold pencils, measure sizes and draw foot types for the vast number of worker-peasant brothers, and make the most suitable leather shoes for them. In the past two years, they have designed more than 1,800 styles and specifications of leather shoes for workers and peasants.

    Always Moving Forward
    In this factory, more than 95% of the old workers suffered the pain of unemployment in the old society. On the eve of liberation, 90% of the people had no shoes to wear; 87% of the people had only one set of clothes; 83% of the people were illiterate; 90% of the people could not afford to marry a wife…. In that dark old society, they made thousands of pairs of leather shoes for the dignitaries, but what they got was endless poverty and suffering. After liberation, they turned themselves over and became masters of the country. They have especially deep feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao. The staff said: "Without the Party and Chairman Mao, there would be no Nan’an Leather Factory."
    For more than ten years, the staff have always regarded every word of Chairman Mao as a guide for their actions.
    Now, quotations from Chairman Mao are posted everywhere in the factory

    坚持勤俭办企业的道路
    ——记重庆南岸皮革厂进一步发扬无产阶级的革命本色
    长江之滨，涂山脚下，有一座以坚持勤俭办企业闻名全国的大庆式企业——重庆南岸皮革厂。
    十多年来，这个厂在党的领导下，由一群解放时的失业制鞋工人组成的小小生产合作社，逐步发展成一个年产二十万双皮鞋的地方国营工厂；由工人进厂时自带的几把锥子、鎯头等简单工具，发展到拥有上百台高效率的机器设备；由靠国家贷款或国营企业预付订金来维持生产，发展到年年给国家上缴数十万元的利润……。
    但是，当你走进这家工厂以后，就会发现厂部办公室仍然是以前买来经过整修的旧民房，室内还是办社初期那几张旧木桌凳，厂里的二十多名干部人人手上还是结着厚厚的老茧，车间里继续摆着合作社时期一直沿用下来的用来盛边角碎皮的“节约筛”……。南岸皮革厂艰苦奋斗的创业精神，克勤克俭的传统作风，无产阶级的革命本色，不但始终保持下来，而且得到了进一步发扬。
    不丢“矮板凳”
    这个厂的干部有句口头语：“我们是坐矮板凳出身的。”
    制鞋工人都是坐在矮板凳上生产。干部们不忘矮板凳，就是不忘本，不忘阶级、不忘广大的阶级弟兄。
    过去，他们在矮板凳上，和工人们一道度过了艰辛的岁月。现在，他们有的当了书记、厂长，但仍然是半天工作，半天参加生产劳动。十多年来，干部们一直没有丢掉这条把他们和工人紧紧联系在一起的矮板凳。在实行“三定一顶”劳动制度的最近十五个月中，厂里的二十四名干部，就亲手做出了二千零三十六双皮鞋，八千五百零七双皮“草鞋”。他们不仅没有忘掉自己的制鞋手艺，而且三分之一的人的手艺达到了先进工人的生产水平。
    建社初期，为了创造生产条件，干部们曾带头挖地基、担泥巴、搬木料，和工人们一起修建厂房。如今，一切条件都和以前大不相同了，但干部们仍然是手拿锄头、肩扛扁担，带领大家修宿舍，修球场，在山坡上垦荒种菜，自己动手改善生活。为了节约生产费用，干部们还经常利用业余时间，到十几里以外的地方去运回原料。
    创业时期，为了克服生产方面的困难，干部们处处带头，以身作则带领群众搞好生产。现在，生产发展了，干部们跟过去一样，吃苦在前，享受在后。他们给自己规定了一条原则：凡是有利的事，一定是先工人，后干部，再领导。干部家属原来住在厂外的，现在仍然住在厂外。厂里虽然修建了一些宿舍，都首先分配给工人住。现任党总支书记胡建华，当干部已经快十年了，仍跟单身工人一起住集体宿舍，亲密无间。
    尽管工厂发展了，但干部们却总是把富日子当穷日子过，从来没有什么特殊要求。书记、厂长的办公室里，至今仍然是那几张旧桌子，硬板凳。干部出差，所花的交通费和住宿费，能够节省的总是尽量节省。有一次，厂长王树培出差到上海购买一批做皮鞋用的材料，在上海住了五个夜晚，都是在可以住宿的浴室里过的。这是工人阶级当家作主的本色。这样的干部，是社会主义企业里最宝贵的财富。工人们都说：这样的干部我们信得过。
    牢记“传家宝”
    南岸皮革厂的工人，百分之九十以上都是开创这个企业的老工人。家业兴旺了，生产发展了，可是，老皮匠们艰苦创业、克勤克俭的革命精神，一直递传下来。
    一九五四年，划料老工人廖树全，把平时划料剩下的边角皮子和别人剪撒在地上的小块皮子，一块块地拣起来，盛在一个竹筛内，随时镶配选用，节约整皮。这种珍惜国家资财的主人翁思想，很快在工人中引起了连锁反应，不久，每个划料工人身边，都出现了这样的竹筛。从此，地上的皮边胶角，不论是大是小，好的坏的，都看不见了。工人们把这种竹筛叫做“节约筛”。一九五九年，重庆市有关领导部门在这个厂开现场会，有的人认为“节约筛”摆在车间里不好看，主张把它收拾起来。但是，老工人们不同意，他们说：“勤俭节约是我们办厂的根本，取消‘节约筛’就是忘本。”就这样，勤俭节约的风气，便连同“节约筛”一起，年复一年地保持了下来。仅据近三年的统计，工人们用“节约筛”里的边角碎皮，就做出了一万四千五百多双皮便鞋、皮“草鞋”和四万四千三百多件皮杂件，为国家增加了四万四千多元收入。
    在“节约筛”的启示下，划料工李绍云又把原来用铅芯划料改为用铁笔划料，为的是一丝一毫地节约皮子；老工人余良兴在污水沟中捞废钉子，数年如一日。工人们就是从这些小处着手，开展了“八个一”的节约活动，千方百计地节约一分面革、一钱底皮、一寸线、一颗钉、一厘钱、一分钟、一度电和一滴胶水。
    这仅仅是一分皮、一寸线吗？不，这正是老皮匠们十多年来一直不变的革命精神。而今，以节约为荣，以浪费为耻，在这个工厂已经形成风尚。
    喜有后来人
    生产发展了，一批批年轻人进入了工厂。南岸皮革厂的老工人怀着革命的深情，关注着年轻一代的成长。党支部选派了全厂最优秀的老师傅，作青年工人的带路人。老师傅把自己精湛的手艺传给了他们，同时也把工人阶级的优良品质传给了他们。
    这个厂有这样一个传统，新工人进厂的第一天，领导就把厂里克勤克俭、白手起家的创业史，当作一堂深刻的阶级教育课，向新工人进行教育，让他们自觉地当好革命接班人，把革命的重担挑起来。
    三年前，这里就曾发生这样一件事：有一个工人家庭出身的姑娘名叫李发琼，原来很想当一个纺织工人，拴上雪白的围腰在纺织机旁，织出各种颜色的布。但是，她走出技工学校以后，偏偏被分配到皮革厂。她失望了，心想：做脚上穿的东西有啥出息。
    一双鞋帮在师傅手里，可以做得那么对称、匀净、光洁，但是，李发琼有时却做得不好，一些皮子被糟踏了。老师傅、共产党员吴燧和教导李发琼说：“只要我们有为人民服务的思想，什么鞋做不好？做鞋是革命的分工，我们制鞋工人要有革命的抱负，把每张皮子都做成优质皮鞋。”有的工人说：“哪一寸牛皮上，不是滴着劳动人民的汗水，我们怎么能够随便出次品呢！”“我们是为人民做皮鞋，每一寸皮、每一根线，都没有权利浪费。”
    李发琼在领导和老工人的帮助下，逐渐懂得做鞋也是干革命的道理。现在，她已经成了优秀的鞋匠，两年多来再也没有出过一双废品，当有人问她在哪里工作时，她就自豪地回答：“在南岸皮革厂做皮鞋！”
    青年划料工罗栋梁，三年前划料时也是大手大脚，别人问他为什么不仔细算算再划。他反问：“这么大个工厂，仓库里皮子堆得象小山，这一星半点顶啥用？”以后，他看见师傅曹子祥常常为摸索最经济的划料方法，废寝忘食地动脑筋。师傅说：“要建设社会主义，就要斤斤计较，在一分钱的距离上闹革命。”罗栋梁听了师傅的话，感到不安了，他决心以师傅作榜样，把节约每一分皮和建设社会主义联系起来。去年，他们师徒从一分皮上闹革命，每人节约了一百多平方米的面革，相当于一千一百多双男式皮鞋的用料，成了全厂著名的“一对红”。
    在南岸皮革厂，象这样的“一对红”，每个车间、每个小组都有。
    做鞋为革命
    两年前，南岸皮革厂进行了一次不寻常的政治学习测验，题目是：你为什么做皮鞋？
    工人们的答案是：为革命。
    为革命做皮鞋！这个光辉的思想，在工厂里，在车间里，在每一条矮板凳上，产生了不可估量的力量。
    为革命做皮鞋，作革命的皮匠，这是南革人胸中的一把量尺。十几年来，他们用这把量尺，弄清是非，明确方向，踏踏实实地不断前进。
    当工厂由小变大、由穷变富、由合作社变成国营工厂的时候，有的人觉得生产发展了，国营工厂应该象个国营工厂的样子，想同别人比气派、比排场。但是，老皮匠出身的工厂领导者却提出了另一个比的标准，就是：比对国家的贡献，比为人民服务，比勤俭办企业的思想。
    有个时候，有人主张把低质皮鞋磨光擦亮，多上点鞋油，充优质皮鞋出售。这件事引起了工人们的强烈反对，他们提出了一个严肃的问题：
    “我们生产皮鞋究竟是为赚钱？还是为人民？”
    “作革命的皮匠，就要老老实实，全心全意为人民服务。”这就是他们的回答。
    南革工人这样想，也这样做。
    在工厂，在农村，在车站，在码头，他们背着画报，拿着铅笔，为广大的工农兄弟量尺码、画脚型，为他们做出最适脚的皮鞋。近两年来，光是为工农群众设计的皮鞋样式和规格，就有一千八百多种。
    永远向前进
    在这个工厂里，百分之九十五以上的老工人在旧社会饱受过失业的痛苦。解放前夕，百分之九十的人没有鞋穿；百分之八十七的人只有一身衣服；百分之八十三的人不认识字；百分之九十的人娶不起老婆……。在那黑暗的旧社会，他们给达官贵人们做出了成千成万双皮鞋，而所得到的，却是无穷无尽的贫困和苦难。解放后，他们翻了身，做了国家的主人。他们对党、对毛主席怀着格外深厚的感情。职工们说：“没有党，没有毛主席，就没有南岸皮革厂。”
    十多年来，职工们一直把毛主席的每一句话当作自己行动的指针。
    现在，工厂里到处贴着毛主席的语录。读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，成了职工们自觉的革命要求。全厂四百零一名职工，每人身边都有毛主席著作，每天早上，职工们都自动提前上班，抽出半小时来学习毛主席著作，检查思想、工作，寻找不断革命的方向。
