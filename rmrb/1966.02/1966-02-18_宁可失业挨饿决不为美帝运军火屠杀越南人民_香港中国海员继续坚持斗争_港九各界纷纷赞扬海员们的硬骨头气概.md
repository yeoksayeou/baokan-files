    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, February 17th: More and more Hong Kong Chinese seamen would rather lose their jobs and go hungry than resolutely transport military supplies for the American imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam.

    According to a report in the Hong Kong newspaper *Wen Wei Po* on the 16th, recently on two ships in Singapore named "Tung Yue" and "Harald Stange," Hong Kong Chinese seamen resolutely refused to go to South Vietnam and have now left the ships and returned to Hong Kong. In Bangkok, the 31 Hong Kong Chinese seamen on the ship "Ken Me Ken" learned that the ship was going to South Vietnam and immediately expressed their opposition. They resolutely demanded that the shipowner change the route, otherwise they would resign.

    According to reports, since March of last year, nearly a thousand Hong Kong Chinese seamen on 31 ships have directly participated in the struggle to refuse to transport military supplies to South Vietnam for American imperialism in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Bangkok, Australia, East Africa, Central and South America, and other places.

    The Hong Kong *Wen Wei Po* has recently been receiving letters and monetary donations of sympathy from workers, teachers, and students in various industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon for these seamen. Readers warmly praised the seamen's backbone spirit in their letters of sympathy.

    According to the Hong Kong *Wen Wei Po*, recently Hong Kong Chinese seamen on two more freighters refused to transport supplies for the American imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam. Their righteous struggle has been warmly praised by all Hong Kong seamen.

    The newspaper reported that in January of this year, when the ten-thousand-ton "Scotstoun," flying the British flag, arrived in Long Beach, USA, the shipping company suddenly announced that it would require the more than 20 Hong Kong seamen on board to transport weapons for the United States to South Vietnam. All the crew members immediately gathered to discuss and unanimously passed a resolution stating, "We resolutely will not transport arms for American imperialism to kill the Vietnamese people," "We resolutely will not be accomplices of American imperialism," and "We would rather return to Hong Kong and lose our jobs than sail to South Vietnam." Under the united struggle of all the crew members, the shipping company had no choice but to cancel the decision to transport arms and changed course to London.

    Another ship, the "Angel Ima," belonging to a Hong Kong shipping company and sailing on the Indonesia-Singapore line, was chartered to the South Vietnamese puppet authorities when it arrived in Singapore on January 19. Upon hearing the news, all 16 Hong Kong seamen on board unanimously stated that they would resolutely not go to South Vietnam, "We will never tarnish the honor of Hong Kong seamen," and demanded that the shipping company change its decision, otherwise they would all quit. It is reported that these 16 crew members have recently returned to Hong Kong.

    宁可失业挨饿决不为美帝运军火屠杀越南人民
    香港中国海员继续坚持斗争
    港九各界纷纷赞扬海员们的硬骨头气概
    据新华社香港十七日电　越来越多的香港中国海员宁可失业、挨饿，坚决拒绝为美帝国主义侵越战争运输军用物资。
    据香港《文汇报》十六日报道，最近在新加坡又有两艘名为“东裕号”和“哈拉德·斯坦格号”船上的香港中国海员坚决不去南越，现已离船返回香港。在曼谷，一艘“健美健号”船上的三十一名香港中国海员获悉这艘船要去南越后，立即表示反对，他们坚决要求船主改变航线，否则就辞职不干。
    据报道，自去年三月以来，已有三十一艘轮船上的近千名香港中国海员分别在香港、新加坡、日本、曼谷、澳洲、东非、中南美等地直接参加了拒绝为美帝国主义运输军用物资去南越的斗争。
    香港《文汇报》最近不断收到港九各业工人、教师、学生给这些海员的慰问信和慰问金。读者们在慰问信里热情赞扬了海员们的硬骨头气概。
    据香港《文汇报》报道，不久前又有两艘货轮上的香港中国海员拒绝为美帝国主义侵越战争运输物资。他们的正义斗争，受到全体香港海员的热烈赞扬。
    报纸报道，今年一月间，一艘悬挂英国旗的“士葛士顿”万吨轮航抵美国长滩时，船公司突然宣布要船上的二十多名香港海员为美国运军械前往南越。全体船员立即集会讨论，一致通过决心书，表示“坚决不为美帝运军火杀害越南人民”，“坚决不做美帝帮凶”，“宁可返港失业，决不航赴南越”。在全体船员的团结斗争下，船公司不得不取消运载军火的决定，改驶伦敦。
    另一艘属于香港一家船公司所有的航行于印度尼西亚—新加坡线的“安吉尔·伊马”号轮，在一月十九日航抵新加坡时，船公司竟宣布将该轮租与南越傀儡当局。船上全体十六名香港海员闻讯后，一致表示坚决不去南越，“决不玷污香港海员的荣誉”，并要求船公司改变决定，否则就全体不干。消息说，这十六名船员最近已返回香港。
