    Where to Start Learning from Jiao Yulu?
    Of all things, studying Mao Zedong Thought comes first. To learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, we should start here, like him, making studying Chairman Mao's works a lifelong fighting task.
    The first time I read "An Example of a County Party Secretary—Jiao Yulu," my eyes filled with tears, deeply moved by the towering image of this great communist fighter; the second time I read "An Example of a County Party Secretary—Jiao Yulu," my thoughts surged, further inspired by the brilliant deeds of this good student of Comrade Mao Zedong. As county party secretaries, we should learn well from Comrade Jiao Yulu. But there are many things to learn; where should we begin? The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's notice calling on the entire army to learn from Jiao Yulu opened up my thinking: Of all things, studying Mao Zedong Thought comes first, we should start here. So, following this red line, I read "An Example of a County Party Secretary—Jiao Yulu" for the third time, increasingly deeply realizing that we must, like him, take studying Mao Zedong Thought as a lifelong fighting task. I raised several questions and requirements for myself, as the first step in learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu. These questions are:
    I. How can we make the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works truly "creative"?
    We have thought about and talked about the issue of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the past, but we could not grasp the key. Now, Comrade Jiao Yulu has given us a vivid answer: the most important thing for the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works is to have class feelings. Comrade Jiao Yulu, with deep class feelings, studied Chairman Mao's works with great thirst, finding direction, gaining strength, and mastering methods from Chairman Mao's works. The creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works also requires linking with reality and being good at thinking about problems. Comrade Jiao Yulu had an excellent experience in studying Chairman Mao's works: "During the day, go to the masses to investigate and visit, return to read Chairman Mao's works, 'replaying the film' at night, and taking notes in the morning." "Replaying the film" means linking with reality to think about problems, so that learning continuously deepens and understanding continuously improves. The most fundamental aspect of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works lies in acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Comrade Jiao Yulu dedicated his life to the revolution, dedicated his life to studying Chairman Mao's works, and even until his death, Chairman Mao's works were placed on his sickbed. As long as we, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, carry class feelings, go deep into the masses, link with reality to think about problems, and strictly act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we can master Mao Zedong Thought, and we can achieve creative study and application.
    II. Where should we begin to "place" Mao Zedong Thought in command in all aspects?
    Comrade Jiao Yulu also provided us with answers in this regard: To put Mao Zedong Thought in command, we must first place it in the leading core of the county party committee, highlighting politics must start with our county committee; and whether the leading core of the county committee is revolutionized is closely related to the "squad leader," so we must first put it in command in the thinking of us secretaries. How can we make Mao Zedong Thought take command in our minds? From Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, my initial understanding is: First, we must constantly improve our political ideology and walk in front of the masses; second, we must strictly demand ourselves in life, be in no way special, and be among the masses; third, in terms of style, we must be good at uniting the masses, good at learning from the masses, and always advance with the masses.
    III. What should we focus on "transforming" with Mao Zedong Thought?
    Transforming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought is a problem we often talk about, and also a problem we often mention to others, but we have not done well ourselves. So, how should we transform our thinking now? According to my situation, the focus should be on the following aspects: First, ideologically, we must overthrow the "self." Comrade Jiao Yulu had all the people in his heart, but not himself, not for fame, not for profit, putting life and death out of consideration. Although we also have the people in our hearts, we still have ourselves to some extent. This is the core problem of transforming ourselves, and we must completely eliminate all selfish and miscellaneous thoughts, and be determined to establish the idea of ​​serving the public in everything. Second, in work, we must fiercely break the "guarding." In those years, Lankao County suffered from the three harms of waterlogging, wind and sand, and salinity, and Comrade Jiao Yulu regarded them as places to temper people's revolutionary will and cultivate people's revolutionary character. Our county has much better conditions than Lankao County in those years, but because we have the idea of ​​being in the middle reaches, sticking to conventions, lacking the courage of revolutionaries, and lacking the daring to change the world, the level of production is far from meeting the needs of the development of the situation. Therefore, we must do our best to fiercely break the "guarding" in our work, and establish the heroic spirit of fighting against the sky, fighting against the earth, and fighting against wind and rain. Third, in terms of style, we must get rid of the "official." Comrade Jiao Yulu appeared in front of the masses when the masses were most in difficulty, and when the masses needed help the most, he cared for the masses and helped the masses; but in the past few years, we have become "official," enjoying comfort and luxury, and our class feelings have gradually weakened. This is a very dangerous signal, and we must resolutely get rid of the "official" and be a hard-working servant of the people. To overthrow the "self," fiercely break the "guarding," and get rid of the "official," the key lies in transforming our position and views, and we must never rely on "old capital" to eat, or consider ourselves as veterans.
    IV. Taking studying Mao Zedong Thought as a lifelong fighting task, where should the battle be launched first now?
    "Go to the masses, go to practice, and the battle should be launched on the front line of agriculture now." This is the strongest reaction of all comrades in our county after studying the heroic deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, and it is also my most urgent inner requirement. Comrade Jiao Yulu worked in Lankao County for more than a year, running around, doing his best, asking the masses for advice, and discussing with the masses, and finally found the correct way to control local natural disasters. As the saying goes, "If the boatman does not work hard, he will delay the entire boat of people." I must be a good "boatman," determined to bring "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," carrying a hoe, carrying a manure basket, to the front line of agriculture, in the posture of a laborer, eating, living, and working with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and with Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of "food chewed by others has no taste," grasping first-hand information, participating in the three major revolutions, and leading the three major revolutions.

    学焦裕禄从哪里学起？
    千条万条，学习毛泽东思想第一条。学习焦裕禄同志应该从这里学起，象他那样把学习毛主席著作作为毕生的战斗任务。
    初读《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》，热泪盈眶，深为这位伟大的共产主义战士的高大形象所感动；再读《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》，思潮起伏，更为这位毛泽东同志的好学生的光辉事迹所鼓舞。作为县委书记，我们应该好好学习焦裕禄同志。但是要学的东西很多，从什么地方学起呢？中国人民解放军总政治部号召全军学习焦裕禄的通知，打开了我的思路：千条万条，学习毛泽东思想第一条，应该从这里开始。于是我循着这条红线，三读《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》，越来越深刻地体会到，必须象他那样把学习毛泽东思想作为毕生的战斗任务。我向自己提出了几个问题和要求，作为向焦裕禄同志学习的第一步。这些问题是：
    一、活学活用毛主席著作，怎样才能“活”起来？
    活学活用毛主席著作问题，过去我们想过，也说过，就是得不到要领。现在焦裕禄同志给我们作了生动的回答：活学活用毛主席著作，最重要的是要有阶级感情。焦裕禄同志怀着深厚的阶级感情，如饥如渴地学习毛主席著作，从毛主席著作中找到了方向，得到了力量，掌握了方法。活学活用毛主席著作还要联系实际，善于思考问题。焦裕禄同志学习毛主席著作有一条极好的经验：“白天到群众中调查访问，回来读毛主席著作，晚上‘过电影’，早上记笔记。”“过电影”就是联系实际思考问题，使学习不断深入，认识不断提高。活学活用毛主席著作最根本的一条还在于根据毛主席指示办事。焦裕禄同志革命一辈子，学习毛主席著作一辈子，直到临死，在他病榻上还放着毛主席著作。我们只要象焦裕禄同志那样带着阶级感情，深入群众，联系实际思考问题，严格地按照毛主席指示办事，就能把毛泽东思想学到手，也就能做到活学活用。
    二、处处以毛泽东思想挂帅，首先从什么地方“挂”起？
    焦裕禄同志在这方面也为我们作了答案：以毛泽东思想挂帅，首先要挂在县委领导核心上，突出政治必须从我们县委突出起；而县委领导核心是否革命化，和当“班长”的有很大的关系，因此又必须首先在我们当书记的思想上挂帅。怎样使毛泽东思想在我们脑子里挂帅呢？从焦裕禄同志的事迹中，我初步的认识是：第一、在政治思想上要不断提高，走在群众前面；第二、在生活上要严格要求自己，毫不特殊，身在群众之中；第三、在作风上要善于团结群众，善于向群众学习，任何时候都跟着群众一起前进。
    三、用毛泽东思想改造自己，当前重点“改”什么？
    用毛泽东思想改造自己，这是我们常谈的问题，也是常常向别人提到的问题，但是自己并没有做好。那么，现在应当怎样改造自己的思想呢？根据我的情况，重点应放在这样几个方面：第一，思想上要斗倒“我”字。焦裕禄同志心里装着全体人民，唯独没有自己，不为名，不为利，把生死置之度外。我们心里虽然也装着人民，但在一定程度上还装着自己。这是改造自己的核心问题，一定要彻底去掉一切私心杂念，下决心树立一切为公的思想。第二，在工作上要狠破“守”字。当年兰考县遭到内涝、风沙、盐碱三害，焦裕禄同志把它们当作锻炼人的革命意志、培养人的革命品格的场所。我县比当年兰考县的条件好得多，但是因为我们有中游思想，因循守旧，缺少革命者的胆略，缺乏改天换地的闯劲，生产水平还远远不能适应形势发展的需要。所以我们在工作上要全力狠破“守”字，树立斗天斗地斗风雨的英雄气概。第三，在作风上打掉“官”字。焦裕禄同志当群众最困难的时候出现在群众面前，在群众最需要帮助的时候，去关心群众，帮助群众；但是我们前几年有了“官”气，养尊处优，阶级感情逐渐淡薄了。这是一个很危险的信号，必须坚决打掉“官”气，做一个勤勤恳恳的人民勤务员。斗倒“我”字，狠破“守”字，打掉“官”字，关键在于改造自己的立场和观点，决不能凭“老本钱”吃饭，以老资格自居。
    四、把学习毛泽东思想作为毕生的战斗任务，现在战斗应从什么地方先打响？
    “到群众中去，到实际中去，现在战斗应到农业第一线去打响。”这是我县全体同志学习焦裕禄同志英雄事迹后最强烈的反应，也是我最迫切的内在要求。焦裕禄同志在兰考县工作一年多的时间里东奔西走，使尽力气，向群众请教，同群众商量，终于找到了治服当地自然灾害的正确道路。俗语说，“艄公不努力，耽误一船人”。我一定要当好这个“艄公”，决心带着《毛泽东选集》，扛着锄头，背着粪兜，到农业第一线，以劳动者的姿态和贫下中农同吃同住同劳动，以焦裕禄同志“吃别人嚼过的馍没味道”的精神掌握第一手资料，参加三大革命，领导三大革命。
