    Arming Peasants with Mao Zedong Thought
    Hebei Province, Xingtai County, Qicun Commune, Nan Jiasu Brigade Party Branch Committee
    Our Nan Jiasu Brigade has undergone tremendous changes in the past two years. People have become revolutionized, and production has increased. This is all thanks to studying Chairman Mao's works.
    A few years ago, our brigade took a detour. When the Party branch previously emphasized political work, people were full of energy, and production was not bad. In 1960, the branch stopped focusing on politics, ideological work weakened, and we went downhill. Production declined year after year, and we lost our direction. In 1963, after rectifying the branch, we again emphasized politics, vigorously grasping the study of Chairman Mao's works. People, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, underwent a fierce class struggle and two-line struggle. The direction became clear, and everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm was reignited. In recent years, production has advanced by leaps and bounds, and life has become more prosperous.
    How does a rural Party branch emphasize politics? It is to learn from the People's Liberation Army, implement the "Four Firsts," highlight politics, and put the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place, constantly arming the peasants with Mao Zedong Thought.
    Arming peasants with Mao Zedong Thought is a fierce ideological struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. What should we arm ourselves with? We must grasp the fundamentals. From past practice, we have learned that arming peasants with Mao Zedong Thought mainly involves breaking down three things: a vague understanding of class and class struggle, selfishness, and superstition about "Old Man Heaven"; and establishing three basic viewpoints: the viewpoint of class and class struggle; the viewpoint of serving the people wholeheartedly; and the viewpoint that the human factor is primary, daring to struggle, and daring to win. We firmly grasp these essential things, and, in combination with the living thoughts of the commune members, organize everyone to study and apply them repeatedly.
    Without understanding class, one cannot understand revolution; forgetting class means forgetting revolution. Class education is the foundation of all ideological education. We advocate studying with class feelings and applying with class feelings. Starting from this link, we enabled the vast number of commune members and cadres to enter the threshold of living study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Party member and old poor peasant Fu Luoshang, who had served as head of the Poor Peasants' Association and head of public security, was very resolute in the struggle against the enemy in the past. After the cooperativization, his class viewpoint became blurred, he gradually lost his revolutionary enthusiasm, and his work became less active. We inspired him to recall the bitterness of the old society, to study the laws of class and class struggle during the socialist construction period, so that he realized that he must not forget class struggle, he must not forget the revolution, and he must adhere to the revolution to the end. In the past two years, he has actively studied Chairman Mao's works, worked tirelessly for the revolution, and eagerly taken on heavy burdens. In the spring of 1964, the brigade's livestock keeper fell ill, and he voluntarily moved to the feeding shed to feed the livestock for three months. During the Spring Festival in 1965, he braved the cold wind and worked while sick to level the land. In November, when the brigade was building a collective pen, he went to dig the pit at night. He has been repeatedly rated as a "Five-Good" commune member and was also elected as director of the village Poor Peasants' Association and member of the county Poor Peasants' Association. Young commune members grew up in sweetness, without experiencing the class exploitation and oppression of the old society, without understanding class and class struggle, and without deep class feelings. Some people found it difficult to study Chairman Mao's works at the beginning. What to do? We hired eight old poor peasants, such as Liu Luogui and Kang Luomian, to be teachers for the youth, telling family histories and revolutionary stories, educating the youth to "continue the family tree of revolution" and never forget their roots. And we organized them to participate in class struggle, so that many young people changed. Young commune member Wu Dazui was picky about his work and often argued with people. After he listened to Liu Luogui tell the village history and family history, branch secretary Fu Luofan studied "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" with him, and he entered the door. He insisted on reading Chairman Mao's books every day, made rapid progress, and became an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works, and also became a study tutor. He was rated as a "Five-Good" commune member in the winter of 1964, joined the Communist Youth League, and joined the army in the spring of 1965. Many young people and old peasants have been armed with the viewpoints of class and class struggle in this way and embarked on the road of revolutionization.
      "Earning points to eat" and "working to support the family," these petty-bourgeois economic thoughts are a mental yoke around the necks of the peasants. How to break this yoke and make people realize that farming for the revolution requires studying Chairman Mao's works, requires repeatedly studying the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly, and inspiring people to fight selfishness and be revolutionary farmers. We organized commune members to repeatedly study articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." In our brigade, through learning from Lei Feng, many people realized that we can also do what Lei Feng did. A surge of doing good deeds emerged among the commune members, such as helping the "Five Guarantees" households, the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and old poor peasants with grinding flour, cooking, carrying grain, fetching water, making clothes, etc. But after a few days, it cooled down again. Some did good deeds for praise, and stopped doing them if no one praised them. This means they had not truly mastered the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly. We guided everyone to focus on understanding the spiritual essence of Chairman Mao's works. Let people deeply study the "completely" and "thoroughly" in "Serve the People" and the spirit of "utter devotion to others without any thought of self" in "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and compare them with their own thoughts. There emerged among the commune members many "anonymous heroes" who did good deeds. In August 1964, there was heavy rain, and the bridge in the village collapsed. The captain sent people to repair it, but when they got to the field, it had already been repaired. We inquired many times, but could not find the person who repaired the bridge. We promoted this spirit of "anonymous heroes," and deeds of "anonymous heroes" appeared in large numbers.
    Breaking superstition about "Old Man Heaven" and daring to wage war against nature is also a big problem. In the autumn of 1963, the E'gong River flooded most of the crops again. The Party branch members asked, can the Nan Jiasu commune members be subjected to natural disasters forever? We looked for answers in Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to do things, to make revolution." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we decided to mobilize the commune members to harness the E'gong River and decided to build a four-Chinese-mile-long canal to divert water for irrigation. At first, some commune members were superstitious about "Old Man Heaven" and lacked confidence. Some also said: "Opening a canal is a good thing, but I'm afraid it won't work because of the cold weather." After studying "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," in the dead of winter, people carried forward the spirit of the "Foolish Old Man," braving the cold wind and heavy snow, working hard and practically, and finally built this canal, turning the harmful river into a beneficial river that can irrigate more than 1,000 mu of land. Now people call this canal the "Foolish Old Man Canal." After one struggle after another to transform the world, the commune members' minds were liberated, and they truly realized that the human factor is primary, and "Old Man Heaven" can be defeated.
    Arming peasants with Mao Zedong Thought requires grasping the fundamentals. Specifically, different people have different ideological problems, and each person also has different manifestations and problems in each period. Uniformity cannot be forced. We feel that doing political and ideological work is in-depth and meticulous work. We must put in hard work, go deep into the masses, constantly study problems, and never engage in mass movements and act rashly.

    用毛泽东思想武装农民
    河北省行唐县齐村公社南贾素大队党支部委员会
    我们南贾素大队这两年光景大变，人革命了，生产上去了，是靠学毛主席著作起家的。
    几年前，我们大队走过一回弯路。在早先党支部重视政治工作的时候，人们劲头子足，生产也搞得不赖。一九六○年支部一度不问政治，思想工作削弱了，就走了下坡路，生产一年不如一年，迷失了方向。到一九六三年，整顿了支部，又突出了政治，大抓毛主席著作的学习，人们用毛泽东思想武装起来，经过一场激烈的阶级斗争和两条道路斗争，方向明了，大伙革命干劲又起来了，这几年生产大步前进，日子越过越兴旺。
    农村党支部怎么突出政治？就是要大学解放军，落实“四个第一”，突出政治，把活学活用毛主席著作放在第一位，不断地用毛泽东思想武装农民。
    用毛泽东思想武装农民，这是一场兴无灭资的思想斗争。武装什么？应当抓根本。从过去的实践中，我们体会到用毛泽东思想武装农民，主要是破三个东西：对阶级、阶级斗争的模糊认识，私心和对“老天爷”的迷信；立三个基本观点：阶级和阶级斗争观点；全心全意为人民服务的观点；人的因素第一，敢于斗争、敢于胜利的观点。我们紧紧抓住这些本质的东西，结合社员中的活思想，组织大家反复学、反复用。
    不懂阶级，就不懂革命；忘掉阶级，就会忘掉革命。阶级教育，是一切思想教育的基础。我们提倡带着阶级感情学，带着阶级感情用。从这一环入手，使广大社员、干部走进了活学活用毛主席著作的门槛。党员、老贫农傅洛尚，担任过贫农团长、治保主任，以前对敌斗争很坚决。合作化以后，阶级观点模糊了，逐渐丧失了革命积极性，工作不积极了。我们启发他忆阶级苦，学习社会主义建设时期阶级和阶级斗争的规律，使他认识到不能忘记阶级斗争，不能忘记革命，要坚持革命到底。这两年他积极学习毛主席著作，为革命不辞辛苦，抢挑重担子。一九六四年春天，队里饲养员病了，他主动搬到饲养棚喂了三个月的牲口。一九六五年春节期间，他冒寒风带病去平整土地。十一月里队里垒集体圈，他夜里去挖圈坑。他多次被评为“五好”社员，还当选为村贫协主任和县贫协委员。青年社员是在甜水里长大的，没有受过旧社会的阶级剥削和压迫，不懂得阶级和阶级斗争，没有深厚的阶级感情，有些人开始学习毛主席著作，学不进去。怎么办？就聘请老贫农刘洛贵、康洛勉等八人给青年当教师，讲家史，说革命故事，教育青年们“续革命的家谱”，永不忘本。并且组织他们参加阶级斗争，使许多青年转变过来。青年社员吴大嘴干活挑肥拣瘦，还常和人吵架，他听了刘洛贵讲村史、家史以后，支部书记傅洛繁又和他一起学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》，他入了门。他坚持天天读毛主席的书，进步很快，成为学习毛主席著作积极分子，还当了学习辅导员。一九六四年冬被评为“五好”社员，入了团，一九六五年春参了军。许多青年、老农就是这样用阶级和阶级斗争的观点武装起来，走上了革命化道路。
      “挣分吃饭”、“干活养家”，这些小农经济思想是套在农民脖子上的一副精神枷锁。怎么打碎这副枷锁，使人们认识为革命种田，要靠学习毛主席著作，要反复学习全心全意为人民服务的思想，启发人们和私心斗，做革命的庄稼人。我们组织社员反复学习《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》等文章。在我们队里，通过学习雷锋，很多人认识到雷锋做好事，我们也能做，随着在社员中出现了大办好事的热潮，给五保户、烈军属、老贫农推碾、做饭、背粮、打水、做衣服等等。但是没过几天，又冷下去了。有的做好事是为表扬，没人表扬就不做了。这是没有真正把全心全意为人民服务的思想学到手。我们就引导大伙重点领会毛主席著作的精神实质。让人们深入学习《为人民服务》中的“完全”、“彻底”和《纪念白求恩》中的“毫不利己专门利人”的精神，和自己的思想对号。随着在社员中出现了不少办好事的“无名英雄”。一九六四年八月下大雨，村里的桥塌了，队长派人去修，到地里一看，早已修好了。我们多次打听，找不到修桥的人。我们发扬了这种“无名英雄”的精神，“无名英雄”的事迹大量出现。
    破除对“老天爷”的迷信，敢于向大自然开战，也是一个大问题。一九六三年秋天，饿公河又淹没了大部分庄稼。党支部委员们提出，南贾素社员能永远受自然灾害的气吗？我们从毛主席著作中找答案。毛主席说：“穷则思变，要干，要革命。”我们按照毛主席的教导，决心发动社员治理饿公河，决定修一条四华里长的渠道，引水浇地。起初有些社员迷信“老天爷”，信心不足。也有的说：“开渠是好事，怕天寒地冻搞不成。”学习了《愚公移山》，在十冬腊月里，人们发扬了“愚公”精神，冒着寒风大雪，苦干实干，终于把这条渠修成了，把害河变成了能浇一千多亩地的利河。现在人们管这条渠叫做“愚公渠”。经过一次再一次改天换地的斗争，社员们思想解放了，真正领悟到了人的因素第一，“老天爷”是可以打败的。
    用毛泽东思想武装农民要抓根本，具体到不同人的身上，各有各的思想问题，每个时期每个人也有不同的表现和问题，要求不能强求一律。我们感到做政治思想工作是深入细致的工作，一定要下苦功夫，要深入群众，不断研究问题，绝不能大哄大嗡，草率从事。
