　　Mudanjiang Produces Boron Carbide Micro-powder
    Boron carbide micro-powder, an advanced abrasive material, has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Mudanjiang Chemical Materials Factory.
    The development of modern mechanical industry, especially advanced industries, has placed increasingly high processing requirements on many machine parts, requiring both specified dimensions and geometric shapes, as well as a high degree of surface finish. Boron carbide micro-powder can partially replace natural diamonds for grinding various high-hardness, high-precision metal parts. In the past, China relied on imports from abroad for this abrasive material. Now, this factory has begun mass production of this product, supplying 180 industrial enterprises across the country.
    The Mudanjiang Chemical Materials Factory was a small factory founded in 1958 by two office cadres and seven housewives, with very simple equipment conditions. However, with the help of relevant units, the workers, after more than 230 experiments, finally mastered the production rules of this advanced artificial abrasive material.

　　牡丹江制成碳化硼微粉
    高级研磨材料——碳化硼微粉，最近在牡丹江化工材料厂试制成功。
    近代机械工业特别是尖端工业的发展，对许多机器零件提出了越来越高的加工要求，既要求达到规定的尺寸和几何形状，又要求有很高的表面光洁度。碳化硼微粉可以部分地代替天然金刚石，用来研磨各种高硬度、高精度的金属零件。这种研磨材料，我国过去都是依靠国外进口。现在，这个厂已经开始成批生产这种产品，供应全国一百八十个工业企业。
    牡丹江化工材料厂是在一九五八年由两名机关干部和七个家庭妇女创办起来的小厂，设备条件很简陋。但是职工们在有关单位的帮助下，经过二百三十多次的试验，终于掌握了这种高级人造研磨材料的生产规律。
