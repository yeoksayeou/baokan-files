    Always Act According to Chairman Mao's Instructions, Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu with Practical Actions
    Workers of Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant Remember Comrade Jiao Yulu
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, February 12th – In the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant, where Comrade Jiao Yulu worked for nine years, the workers remember Comrade Jiao Yulu with deep feelings. Everyone is determined to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way like Comrade Jiao Yulu, carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, accelerate ideological revolutionization, and learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu with practical actions.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu worked at the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant from 1953 to 1962 for nine years, successively serving as workshop director, production scheduling section chief, and other positions. Zhao Xiangqing, the factory's Party Committee Secretary, said: "Comrade Jiao Yulu always thought of work, the masses, and the revolution during the eight or nine years he was in the factory. We never heard him complain about hardship or difficulties, nor did we ever hear him make any personal demands. This selfless and noble quality is the result of his living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. We must conscientiously learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, transform our own thinking, and be thorough revolutionaries."
    Comrade Jiao Yulu worked in the First Metalworking Workshop for four years when he first arrived at the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant. On the 11th, hundreds of workers in this workshop held a memorial meeting for Comrade Jiao Yulu in front of the oath "Inherit the Legacy and Carry out the Revolution, Dare to Shed Blood and Sacrifice," "Take the Red Flag for the People, Not Afraid of Hardship and Fatigue." The workshop's General Branch Secretary and representatives from six production teams said: Comrade Jiao Yulu used to be a good leader of our workshop and our close comrade-in-arms. He had many ideas for the First Metalworking Workshop during his lifetime, wanting to greatly change the workshop's outlook and improve the level of production. We are determined to take over Comrade Jiao Yulu's work, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions at all times like him, accelerate revolutionization, and turn the First Metalworking Workshop into a Daqing-style workshop as soon as possible.
    At the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant, many workers received Comrade Jiao Yulu's kind care and assistance. Liu Yuying, the deputy section chief of the production scheduling section, who had worked under Comrade Jiao Yulu's guidance for many years, was both excited and saddened after listening to the broadcast of Jiao Yulu's deeds. He said: "Comrade Jiao Yulu truly deserves to be called a good student of Chairman Mao; how can I be worthy of being called a good student of Jiao Yulu? I am still far behind." He said: "Comrade Jiao Yulu took me to Dalian for an internship and later served as the head of our scheduling section. At that time, he explicitly taught me to lead professional work with politics. When holding production meetings, he would first read a passage from Chairman Mao's works, and he would read the newspaper every day, no matter how busy he was with work. He told me that to do a good job, we must grasp ideology. He said that cadres should be viewed from two perspectives; many comrades want to do their jobs well, and it depends on how we lead the 'troops.' Being a leader means coming up with ideas and using cadres. He also instructed that we must conduct in-depth investigations and research when doing work. The scheduling section commands the entire factory's production, and whether the information is accurate will affect the labor of thousands of workers; the key lies in the leadership's work style. Now, looking back, it seems as if his voice and smile are still before my eyes. I will definitely learn from him, transform my thinking, improve my work, and live up to his teachings."
    Lu Yongxun, a dispatcher in the Second Metalworking Workshop, recalled that when he first took up his post, Comrade Jiao Yulu guided him in the correct direction with Chairman Mao's works. He said: "In 1954, I graduated from Zhongyuan University and came to the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant. Comrade Jiao Yulu was our workshop director. At that time, I lacked practical professional knowledge, so I went to Comrade Jiao Yulu repeatedly. He only gave me three books, one was Selected Works of Mao Zedong, and the other two were other political theory books. He said to me: First, you must read the first book well. If you study the first book well, you will also understand the second and third books. At first, I was very unhappy. I thought that I had already studied for more than ten years, and now he is still asking me to study. When will I be able to improve my professional skills? Later, with the specific help of Comrade Jiao Yulu, and after my own practice in these years, I gradually understood that he was helping me improve politically with Mao Zedong Thought, which is the most valuable."
    In the past few days, an issue has been constantly swirling in the mind of Eighth-Grade Technician Yu Yonghe: "People all over the country are learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, but I used to work alongside Comrade Jiao Yulu for seven years. How inappropriate would it be if I couldn't learn his revolutionary spirit." Yu Yonghe received Comrade Jiao Yulu's deep care during the seven years he worked alongside him. He said: "During those seven years, I would often stop by Jiao Yulu's house after work. Usually, when I had difficulties in production, Comrade Jiao Yulu would stay by the machine encouraging me day and night, and he was even stricter with me politically. I didn't come from a working-class family, but Comrade Jiao Yulu didn't look at people with a purely class-based perspective, but he didn't relax in helping me carry out ideological transformation. He often said: Lao Yu, it's good that you are actively working for the Party; but you still have old habits and must withstand the Party's long-term test. I have always kept his teachings in mind, but unfortunately, I haven't transformed myself well enough. Now I think that others are learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, and I should learn even better. I must use Mao Zedong Thought to transform myself, discard everything personal, and contribute my strength to the revolution."
    Some comrades who had once fallen behind but have stood up again miss Jiao Yulu even more. He Zhuolin, the leader of the dispatching group in the dispatching section, and his wife and children, listened to the broadcast three times with tears in their eyes. The tall image of Comrade Jiao Yulu reappeared before He Zhuolin's eyes. Before He Zhuolin came to the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant, he had made mistakes in his work, and after coming to the factory, he had a heavy ideological burden and could not hold his head up all day long. Just as he was distressed, one night, Comrade Jiao Yulu came to his home in heavy snow and had a long talk with him for more than three hours. Jiao Yulu said: "Regarding your mistakes, you should be saddened by the losses suffered by the Party, and you should not consider personal gains or losses. You are very young and still have hope. You must have the courage to stand up. Chairman Mao said that bad things can turn into good things, and as long as you work hard to transform your thinking, you will definitely be able to become a good comrade." Jiao Yulu finally patted him on the shoulder and said: "You must be able to withstand the Party's test of you." These words gave He Zhuolin infinite strength and courage. From then on, Jiao Yulu often cared for him and encouraged him. When Jiao Yulu fell ill, he also called He Zhuolin to his bedside to learn about his thoughts and work. Later, Jiao Yulu went to Zhengzhou for medical treatment and still wrote to him. He Zhuolin did not disappoint Comrade Jiao Yulu's expectations. After a period of testing, he became the leader of the dispatching group responsible for organizing the factory's dispatching work. He said: "I am still far from Comrade Jiao Yulu's requirements for me. I must always take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example and work and live like him."
    The factory also held a workers' congress, calling on all workers to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of thorough revolution. Now, from the factory's leading cadres to the workshop workers, they are all using Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror to find gaps in order to transform their thinking, improve their work style, and change the factory's outlook as soon as possible.

    时时按毛主席的指示办事  用实际行动向焦裕禄学习
    洛阳矿山机器厂职工追念焦裕禄同志
    新华社郑州十二日电　在焦裕禄同志曾经工作过九年的洛阳矿山机器厂，职工们怀着深厚的感情，追念着焦裕禄同志。大家决心象焦裕禄同志那样活学活用毛主席著作，发扬彻底革命的精神，加速思想革命化，以实际行动，向焦裕禄同志学习。
    焦裕禄同志从一九五三年到一九六二年，在洛阳矿山机器厂工作了九年，先后担任过车间主任、生产调度科科长等职务。这个厂的党委书记赵祥庆说：“焦裕禄同志在厂八九年时间，时时刻刻想着工作、想着群众、想着革命，从来没听说他叫过苦、叫过困难，也没听说他在个人问题上提出过任何要求。这种忘我的高贵品质，正是他活学活用毛主席思想的结果。我们要认真向焦裕禄同志学习，活学活用毛主席著作，改造自己的思想，做个彻底的革命者。”
    焦裕禄同志刚到洛阳矿山机器厂，就在第一金工车间工作了四年。十一日，这个车间的几百名职工，在“继遗志干革命敢于流血牺牲”，“接红旗为人民不怕吃苦受累”的誓言面前，举行了悼念焦裕禄同志的大会。车间总支书记和六个生产班组的代表说：焦裕禄同志曾经是咱车间的好领导，是我们亲密的战友。他生前对一金工车间有很多设想，要大大改变车间面貌，提高生产水平。我们决心接好焦裕禄同志的班，象他那样时时按毛主席指示办事，加速革命化，尽快把一金工车间办成大庆式的车间。
    在洛阳矿山机器厂，有许多职工得到过焦裕禄同志的亲切关怀和帮助。曾在焦裕禄同志帮助下工作多年的生产调度科副科长刘玉莹，听了焦裕禄事迹的广播以后，又激动又难过地说：“焦裕禄同志真不愧为毛主席的好学生；我咋样才配称焦裕禄的好学生呢，还差得老远。”他说：“焦裕禄同志曾带我到大连实习，后期担任我们调度科的科长。那时他就明确教导我要以政治带业务。召开生产会议时，他先念一段毛主席著作，每天工作再忙也要看报纸。他告诉我，要抓思想才能做好工作。他说对干部要一分为二，很多同志都是想把工作做好的，就看咱怎么带‘兵’，当领导就是出主意和使用干部。他还嘱咐说，做工作必须深入调查研究，调度科指挥全厂生产，情况准不准，会影响千百个工人的劳动，关键在于领导作风。现在回想起来，好象他的音容笑貌还在眼前。我一定好好向他学习，改造我的思想，改进工作，不辜负他的教导。”
    二金工车间调度员芦永训回忆他刚走上工作岗位时，焦裕禄同志就用毛主席著作给他指引正确的方向。他说：“一九五四年，我从中原大学毕业来到洛阳矿山机器厂，焦裕禄同志是我们的车间主任。当时，我缺乏实际的业务知识，就三番五次去找焦裕禄同志，他却只给了我三本书，一本是毛泽东选集，还有两本其他政治理论书。他对我说：先要读第一本，第一本学好了，第二第三本也就会了。开始我很不高兴，我想自己已经读了十几年书，现在还叫读书，到什么时候才能从业务上提高呢？后来，在焦裕禄同志具体帮助下，又经过自己这几年的实践，才逐渐理解到他是用毛主席思想从政治上帮助我提高，这是最宝贵的。”
    这几天，在八级技工于永和的脑子里，老盘旋着一个问题：“全国各地人们都在向焦裕禄同志学习，而我过去在焦裕禄同志身边工作七年，要是不能把他的革命精神学到手，这多么不应该。”于永和在焦裕禄身边工作七年间，一直得到焦裕禄同志的深切关怀。他说：“七年中，我经常下班后总要顺脚到焦裕禄家里去。平时当我生产上有困难，焦裕禄同志整日整夜陪在机台旁边鼓励我，在政治上更严格要求我。我不是劳动人民家庭出身，但焦裕禄同志不用唯成分论看人，而又不放松帮助我进行思想改造。他常说：老于，你为党积极工作，这很好；但还有旧习气，要经得起党的长期考验。我一直牢记着他的教导，可惜我改造得不够好。现在我想，别人都在学习焦裕禄同志，我更应该学好，一定要用毛泽东思想来改造自己，丢弃个人的一切，为革命贡献自己的力量。”
    一些曾经掉过队又重新站起来的同志，更加怀念焦裕禄。调度科调度组长何卓林和他的爱人、孩子，含着眼泪一连收听了三次广播，焦裕禄同志的高大形象又出现在何卓林眼前。何卓林来洛阳矿山机器厂之前，工作中曾经犯过错误，到厂以后，思想包袱很沉重，整天抬不起头来。正当他苦恼的时候，一天晚上，焦裕禄同志冒着大雪来到他家里，同他畅谈了三个多小时。焦裕禄说：“对待自己犯错误的事，你应当为党遭受了损失而难过，不应当考虑个人得失。你很年轻，还有希望，要有勇气站起来，毛主席说，坏事也能变成好事，只要努力改造自己的思想，一定能成为一位好同志。”焦裕禄最后拍着他的肩膀说：“要经受得起党对你的考验。”这些话给何卓林增加了无限的力量和勇气。从此以后，焦裕禄经常关怀他鼓励他。焦裕禄病倒了，还把何卓林叫到病床前，了解他的思想和工作情况。以后焦裕禄到郑州养病，还给他来信。何卓林没有辜负焦裕禄同志的期望，经过一段时间的考验，他担任了负责组织全厂调度工作的调度组长。他说：“我距离焦裕禄同志对我的要求还很远，要时时刻刻以焦裕禄同志为榜样，象他那样工作和生活。”
    这个厂还召开了职工大会，号召全体职工学习焦裕禄同志的彻底革命精神。现在从工厂领导干部到车间工人，都在以焦裕禄同志作镜子，找差距，以便改造自己的思想，改进工作作风，尽快地改变工厂的面貌。
