　　New Flowers of Resistance Against America and Saving the Nation
　　——Praising the Dance Creations of the Vietnamese Song and Dance Troupe
　　Hu Guogang
    Comrade Qu Hui Jin, head of the Vietnamese Song and Dance Troupe and a poet, said: What we bring are flower branches that were produced in battle, bloomed beside the trenches, and haven't had time to be trimmed. After we excitedly watched their performance, we thought it should be added that it not only has a rich earthy fragrance, but also carries the intense smoke of battle. It's not just generally fragrant, but as Chairman Mao said in his poem "Picking Mulberries - Double Ninth Festival," "battlefield flowers are especially fragrant." It is the development of the traditional art of the Vietnamese people, a new flower blooming in the Vietnamese people's struggle against America to save the nation!
    Dances like "Under the Banner of the Liberation Front," "Wooden Hand Grenades," "Wasp Warfare," and "One Hand Casting Nets, One Hand Holding a Gun," "Meeting at the Anti-Aircraft Artillery Position," "On the Border Line," and others, vividly depict for us, from various aspects of life, a picture of the Vietnamese people in the North under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, and the Vietnamese people in the South under the leadership of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, victoriously carrying out the struggle against America to save the nation: The Vietnamese people in the South "Under the Banner of the Liberation Front" are heroically carrying out a people's war, using not only weapons seized from the enemy and weapons brought by soldiers who revolted from the puppet army to strike the enemy, but even children's "wooden hand grenades" and elderly people's raised wasps can be used to strike and annihilate the American invading bandits. One hand plowing, one hand holding a gun, one hand holding a hammer, one hand holding a gun, "One hand casting nets, one hand holding a gun," soldiers and civilians “Meeting at the Anti-Aircraft Artillery Position” to jointly strike American aerial bandits, and soldiers and civilians jointly patrolling "On the Border Line," vigilantly watching for all the enemy's sabotage activities, are all true reflections of the combat life of the Vietnamese people in the North. The actors, with their own personal experience of combat life and brilliant performances, coupled with the vivid portrayal of music, conducting, and playing, have reached a very high level in both thought and art. We have seen excellent song and dance performances by the Vietnamese people many times in the past, but this is the first time we have seen an entire performance using the form of song and dance art to comprehensively and vividly express the reality of revolutionary struggle. The fact that Vietnamese people's song and dance art can achieve such great development in combat is inseparable from the fact that the Vietnamese people have created countless heroic achievements in the struggle against America to save the nation, providing art workers with a wealth of creative material, and that Vietnamese art workers go deep into the front lines, war zones, and armies to participate in combat with the people, and use literary and artistic weapons to directly inspire the morale of the army and the people, and become members of the battle themselves.
    When we met this time, Comrade Chen Ming, the dance choreographer, on behalf of a group of Vietnamese dance worker comrades who were acquainted with us, presented Chinese dance workers with an extremely precious gift - an American-made "F01" aircraft model carved with a knife by the soldiers guarding the Ham Rong Bridge in Vietnam from the wreckage of downed American aircraft, on which was also engraved the time of shooting down the aircraft "3.4.4.1965." This was given to him by the soldiers when he went there to participate in the battle with them. In the year or so that Comrade Chen Ming has been apart from us, which is also the year or so that American bandits began bombing North Vietnam, he successfully created four dance works in this performance by the Vietnamese Song and Dance Troupe in our country. It is understood that during this year or so, other dance worker comrades in Vietnam, like him, have also successfully created and performed many dance works reflecting the reality of combat life, making outstanding contributions to the Vietnamese people's struggle against America to save the nation and to the development of Vietnamese revolutionary dance art! Through them, we Chinese dance workers extend our highest respect to our closest comrades, comrades, and brothers - the Vietnamese dance workers fighting on the front lines of resistance against America and saving the nation!
    The people of South and North Vietnam have set a shining example for the people of the world in their struggle against America to save the nation; Vietnamese literary and art workers, who go deep into the front lines, war zones, and armies and fight alongside the people, using literary and artistic weapons to inspire the morale of the army and the people, have set an example for us to learn from! I wish the Vietnamese people a great victory in their struggle against America to save the nation! I wish the Vietnamese people a great victory in their revolutionary combat art! (Attached pictures)

　　抗美救国的新花
　　——赞越南歌舞艺术团的舞蹈创作
　　胡果刚
    越南歌舞艺术团团长、诗人瞿辉瑾同志说：我们带来的是在战斗中产生，开在堑壕旁还未来得及剪修的花枝。当我们兴奋地看完了他们的演出之后，想着还应加以补充的是：它不仅具有着浓郁的泥土芬芳，而且还带着炽热的战斗硝烟。它不是一般地香，而是象毛主席在《采桑子·重阳》一词中所说的“战地黄花分外香”。它是越南人民传统艺术的发展，是在越南人民抗美救国斗争中开出来的新花！
    舞蹈《在解放阵线的大旗下》、《木头手榴弹》、《蚂蜂战》和《一手撒网、一手拿枪》、《高射炮阵地相会》、《在边界线上》等，从各个生活侧面，给我们生动地描绘出了一幅幅越南北方人民在越南劳动党、胡志明主席领导下，越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线领导下胜利地进行抗美救国斗争的图画：越南南方人民“在解放阵线的大旗下”，英勇地开展了全民战争，他们不仅用从敌人手中夺过来的武器，伪军中起义士兵带来的武器去打击敌人，连小孩的“木头手榴弹”，老人养的蚂蜂都能用来打击和消灭美国侵略强盗。一手扶犁、一手拿枪，一手拿锤、一手拿枪，“一手撒网、一手拿枪”，军民在
  “高射炮阵地相会”，一同打击美国空中强盗，军民“在边界线上”共同巡逻，机警地注视着敌人的一切破坏活动，则是越南北方人民战斗生活的真实反映。演员以自己亲身战斗生活的体验和精采的表演，加上乐曲、指挥和演奏的生动描绘，在思想上和艺术上都达到了很高的境界。我们过去曾多次看过越南人民优秀的歌舞艺术表演，但看到整个的一场都用歌舞艺术的形式，去全面生动地表现革命现实斗争生活，还是第一次。越南人民的歌舞艺术，在战斗中能获得这样巨大的发展，除了越南人民在抗美救国斗争中创造了无数英雄的业绩，为艺术工作者提供了大量丰富的创作材料之外，与越南的艺术工作者深入前线、战区与军队，和人民一起参加战斗，用文艺武器去直接鼓舞军队和人民的斗志，本身就成了战斗的一员是分不开的。
    舞蹈编导陈明同志，这次和我们相见的时候，他代表和我们相识的一批越南舞蹈工作的战友，送给了中国舞蹈工作者一件极其珍贵的礼物——守卫越南咸龙桥的战士用打下来的美机残骸，用小刀刻成的一个美制“F01”飞机模型，上面还刻着“3．4．4．1965”击落这架飞机的时刻。这是他到那里去和战士们一同参加战斗时，战士们送给他的。陈明同志在和我们相别的一年多的时间里，也就是美国强盗开始轰炸越南北方的这一年多里，他就成功地创作了这次越南歌舞艺术团来我国演出中的四个舞蹈作品。据了解，在这一年多的时间里，越南其他的舞蹈工作同志，也和他一样，都成功地创作和演出了很多反映战斗现实生活的舞蹈作品，为越南人民的抗美救国斗争，为越南革命舞蹈艺术的发展作出了杰出的贡献！我们中国的舞蹈工作者，通过他们向我们最亲密的战友、同志和兄弟——战斗在抗美救国最前线的越南舞蹈工作者，致以崇高的敬意！
    越南南方和北方的人民，在抗美救国斗争中，为世界人民树立了光辉的榜样；越南的文艺工作者，深入前线、战区与军队和人民一起战斗，用文艺武器去鼓舞军队和人民的斗志，为我们树立了学习的榜样！祝越南人民抗美救国斗争的伟大胜利！祝越南人民革命战斗艺术的巨大胜利！（附图片）
