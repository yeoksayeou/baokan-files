　　Give Full Play to the Role of Water Conservancy in Increasing Agricultural Production
　　Hubei's Hilly Areas Widely Build Field Canal Network Projects
    The construction of field canal networks mainly involves three things: First, digging field drainage and irrigation canals to deliver water to the fields, allowing for free drainage and irrigation; second, building field structures to control drainage and irrigation; and third, renovating old ponds and weirs to increase water storage and achieve gravity irrigation, connecting ponds and weirs with canals.
    This newspaper reports that the cadres and commune members in the vast hilly areas of Hubei Province, carrying forward the spirit of continuous revolution, are taking the Jianzhong Brigade of the Qiupei Commune in Huangpi County as an example, and are building field canal network projects in a planned and step-by-step manner. They are comprehensively supporting existing water conservancy facilities, advancing towards high-standard water conservancy, so that water conservancy can better serve agricultural production.
    The construction of field canal networks mainly involves doing three things well: digging field drainage and irrigation canals to deliver water to the fields, allowing for free drainage and irrigation, and creating conditions for scientific water use; building field structures to control drainage and irrigation; and renovating old ponds and weirs to increase water storage, changing pumped irrigation to gravity irrigation, connecting ponds and weirs with canals, irrigating ponds with canals, and irrigating fields with ponds. These small-scale projects are simple in technology, require little money and labor, but have a significant effect. They can ensure timely drainage and irrigation, rational water use, eliminate waterlogged hills, transform cold and waterlogged fields, so that water conservancy can better serve increased agricultural production.
    Since 1958, Hubei Province has built hundreds of large, medium, and small reservoirs in mountainous and hilly areas, controlling more than 10 billion cubic meters of irrigation water sources. In addition to continuously digging main and branch canals from the reservoirs, the problem of drought and water shortage in most hilly areas has been basically solved. However, new contradictions have arisen: after the construction of reservoirs, small ponds and weirs have not been renovated, and the water from the reservoirs cannot play a greater role. Main and branch canals have been dug, but because there are no field water conveyance canals, water is supplied and drained in a series of overflows. Many fields have become waterlogged hills, which damage seedlings and erode fertilizer, and the groundwater level in the low-lying fields cannot be lowered, resulting in "cold soaking," and grain production is still difficult to increase.
    The cadres and commune members of the Jianzhong Brigade of the Qiupei Commune in Huangpi County have gained a deep understanding of the above contradictions in practice. From studying this series of new contradictions, they realized that with large reservoirs, it is also necessary to focus on ponds and weirs; with water sources, it is necessary to continue to solve the problems of how to manage, how to use, and how to irrigate the fields. Starting in the spring of 1964, they began to construct field canal network projects. After more than a year of battle, they have excavated 56 field canals, built more than 370 large and small structures for water distribution and regulation, and renovated 21 old ponds and weirs, increasing the effective irrigation water by more than 44,000 cubic meters. The entire brigade has formed a drainage and irrigation system connecting reservoirs with ponds, ponds with canals, and canals with fields. In the event of drought, opening the auxiliary gates on the ponds and canals, the water flows along the field canals like veins, according to the order of high-water high irrigation and low-water low irrigation, dividing hills and blocks, and flowing into the farmland without interfering with each other. The realization of field canal networking has prevented more than 360 mu of waterlogged hills in this brigade from being scoured by cold water and losing fertilizer; raised the soil temperature of 83 mu of cold and waterlogged fields; and changed 53 mu of perennially waterlogged paddy fields from one crop a year to two crops a year, thus rapidly increasing grain production. Moreover, this place, which has never grown cotton, planted 62 mu of cotton for the first time last year, achieving a good harvest of more than 90 jin of ginned cotton per mu.
    The Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Department attaches great importance to the experience of the Jianzhong Brigade in building field canal network projects. It held a field meeting here in a timely manner, calling on the hilly areas of the province to learn from the experience of this brigade. Huanggang, Xiaogan, Xiangyang and other hilly areas have successively organized more than 20,000 cadres from counties, districts, communes, and brigades to visit and learn from here. After the visit, many representatives unanimously believed that the construction of field canal networks is an important step in the comprehensive support of water conservancy projects and advancement towards high-standard water conservancy, and also a major technical reform measure for building stable and high-yield farmland. In order to better promote the experience of the Jianzhong Brigade, various localities have also established their own models, in order to obtain direct experience and then comprehensively promote it. Huanggang Prefecture's Huanggang, Xinzhou, Huangmei, Hong'an and other eight counties selected 80 brigades last winter as pilot projects for the construction of field canal networks. At present, most of these pilot projects have been basically completed, and some counties are developing from point to area. Huanggang County, in carrying out pilot work, organized cadres and peasant technicians from more than 190 production brigades to participate in planning and construction on the spot, learning while doing, and starting their own work after returning. In this way, the number of brigades in this county carrying out field canal network construction has now expanded to more than 240, with a farmland area of more than 290,000 mu. Xiangyang Prefecture first established models in the Bailian Commune of Guanghua County and the Hongshan Commune of Sui County, and after organizing cadres from various counties to visit and study, the construction of field canal networks quickly developed. Now, each county in this prefecture has a special team specifically responsible for this work, and leaders at all levels have established models, using points to drive the surface. The cultivated land area in the entire prefecture carrying out field canal network construction is about 300,000 mu. The field canal network construction work in Xiaogan Prefecture is also gradually unfolding from point to area.
    When constructing field canal network projects, various localities have paid attention to closely combining it with current production, adopting the method of one-time planning, completed in stages, intensive work during the slack season, light work during the busy season, and no work during the very busy season. Activities requiring more labor, such as material preparation and canal digging, are organized in concentrated efforts during the slack season; the construction of structures requires certain technical skills, so a few people are fixed to specialize in construction. The materials needed for field structures are mainly "soil," taken locally. If they do not understand the technology, they practice on the spot, learning while doing.

　　充分发挥水利对农业增产的作用
　　湖北丘陵区广泛修建田间渠网工程
    修建田间渠网工程主要是办好三件事：一、开挖田间排灌渠道，送水到田，排灌自如；二、修建田头建筑物，控制排灌；三、改造旧塘堰，增加蓄水，实现自流灌溉，使塘堰和渠道连系起来。
    本报讯　湖北省广大丘陵地区的干部和社员，发扬不断革命精神，以黄陂县丘陂公社建中大队为榜样，正在有计划有步骤地修建田间渠网工程，对现有水利设施进行全面配套，向高标准水利化前进，使水利更好地为农业生产服务。
    修建田间渠网工程，主要是办好三件事：开挖田间排灌渠道，送水到田，排灌自如，为科学用水创造条件；修建田头建筑物，控制排灌；改造旧有塘堰，增加蓄水，变提水灌溉为自流灌溉，使塘堰和渠道连系起来，渠灌塘，塘灌田。这些小型工程技术简单，花钱、花工不多，作用却很大。它可以保证及时排灌，合理用水，消灭过水丘，改造冷浸田，使水利更好地为农业增产服务。
    一九五八年以来，湖北省在山区丘陵区兴修了几百座大中小型水库，控制了一百多亿立方米的灌溉水源，加上不断开挖水库干渠和支渠，使大部分丘陵地区干旱缺水问题基本得到解决。但是，这时又发生了新的矛盾：修了水库，小塘小堰没有进行改造，水库的水不能发挥更大作用。开挖了干渠支渠，由于没有田间输水渠道，都是串灌漫灌，串排漫排，很多田成了过水丘，既冲损禾苗，流失肥料，又使地势低洼的冲垄田地下水位不能降低，造成“冷浸”，粮食产量仍难以提高。
    黄陂县丘陂公社建中大队的干部和社员，在实践中对以上矛盾有了深刻的体会，他们从研究这一系列新的矛盾中，认识到有了大水库，还要抓塘堰；有了水源，还要继续解决怎么管，怎么用，怎么灌到田里的问题。他们从一九六四年春天起，就开始着手建设田间渠网工程。经过一年多的战斗，共开挖田间渠道五十六条，兴建分水、节制等大小建筑物三百七十多处，整修旧有塘堰二十一口，增加有效灌溉用水四万四千多立方米。全大队已经形成了库连塘、塘连渠、渠连田的排灌系统。发生干旱，打开塘堰和渠道上的副闸，水便顺着一条条脉筋似的田间渠道，按照高水高灌、低水低灌的秩序，分丘分块，互不干扰地流进农田。田间渠网化的实现，使这个大队的三百六十多亩过水丘避免了冷水冲刷，流失肥料；使八十三亩冷浸田提高了地温；使五十三亩常年渍水的烂泥田由一年一熟，改为一年两熟，因而粮食产量迅速提高。而且这个历来不种棉花的地方，去年第一次植棉六十二亩，获得亩产皮棉九十多斤的较好收成。
    湖北省水利厅对建中大队修建田间渠网工程的经验很重视，及时在这里召开现场会议，号召全省丘陵地区学习这个大队的经验。黄冈、孝感、襄阳等丘陵地区先后组织了两万多名县、区、社队干部前往这里参观取经。许多代表参观后，都一致认为修建田间渠网，是水利工程全面配套，向高标准水利化前进的一个重要步骤，也是建设稳产高产农田的一项重大技术改革措施。各地为了更好地推广建中大队的经验，还办起了自己的样板，以便取得直接经验，再全面推广。黄冈专区的黄冈、新洲、黄梅、红安等八个县，去年冬天就选择了八十个大队，作为修建田间渠网的试点，目前这些试点工程大部分基本完工，有些县正在由点到面地开展。黄冈县，在进行试点工作时，就组织了一百九十多个生产大队的干部、农民技术员到点上参加规划施工，边做边学，回去后自己又干了起来。这样，这个县进行田间渠网建设的大队，现在已扩大到二百四十多个，农田面积达二十九万多亩。襄阳专区首先在光化县白莲公社和随县洪山公社办了样板，组织各县干部参观学习后，田间渠网建设迅速开展起来。现在，这个专区的每个县，都有专门班子具体负责这项工作，各级领导都办有样板，以点带面，全专区进行田间渠网建设的耕地面积约有三十多万亩。孝感专区的田间渠网建设工作，也正在由点到面逐步展开。
    各地在修建田间渠网工程的时候，注意紧密结合当前生产，采取了一次规划，分期完成，农闲大干，农忙小干，大忙不干的办法。备料、挖渠等需工较多的活路，就利用农闲季节组织劳力突击；修建筑物需要一定的技术，就固定几个人专门施工。田间建筑物所需材料，以“土”为主，就地取材，不懂技术就现场练兵，边做边学。
