Title: Cambodian Weekly "The Nationalist" Publishes Editorial: The United States Must Respect the Geneva Accords and Withdraw Troops from South Vietnam. Some people call for the aggressed and the aggressor to negotiate, but ignore the Geneva Accords. If they understood the Geneva Accords, they should demand that the United States withdraw its troops and bases from South Vietnam.

　　Phnom Penh, February 21 (Xinhua) – The Cambodian weekly "The Nationalist" recently published an editorial stating: "The leaders of the United States cunningly say that their only wish is to return to the Geneva Accords." However, "if the United States had strictly abided by the document signed in July 1954, there would have been no 'Vietnam problem' at all."
    The organ of the Cambodian "People's Socialist Community" pointed out in the editorial: Some people are issuing calls "demanding that the warring parties hold negotiations, or to be more precise, that the aggressed and the aggressor hold negotiations, yet they pay no attention whatsoever to what was signed in Geneva twelve years ago."
    The editorial said: "People have the right to doubt whether these governments and individuals who are willing to 'mediate' truly understand the Geneva Accords and the situation in South Vietnam since 1954. If they do understand, it would be enough to send Washington a short note demanding that the United States withdraw its troops and bases from South Vietnam in order to fulfill the agreement that they dare to mention."
    The editorial pointed out that the war in South Vietnam is essentially "the people's resistance against successive governments imposed by a foreign power." It said, "We cannot allow the American army to prevent the South Vietnamese people from deciding their own future today, even by force."
    The editorial said that the United States also knows that its military occupation of South Vietnam violates the Geneva Accords and the United Nations Charter. The United States' claim that it is defending a country supposedly suffering from "foreign aggression" is, of course, absurd.
    The editorial said: "The United States has fallen into a predicament. The United States can only get out of the predicament by returning to the letter and spirit of the Geneva Accords. The condition is that the United States no longer makes new interpretations to maintain its troops and bases there."
    The editorial concluded: "Unfortunately, it is obvious that the madmen in the Pentagon are stubbornly trying to turn South Vietnam into a military base for attacking China. This is the crux of the problem, and this problem is not negotiable and cannot be resolved."

　　柬埔寨《民族主义者》周刊发表社论
　　美国必须尊重日内瓦协议从南越撤军
　　有些人呼吁被侵略者和侵略者谈判却不理会日内瓦协议，如果了解日内瓦协议，就应要求美国从南越撤出军队和基地。
    新华社金边二十一日电　最近一期的柬埔寨《民族主义者》周刊发表社论说：“美国的领导人狡猾地说，他们的唯一愿望是回到日内瓦协议。”但是，“要是美国严格遵守了这个在一九五四年七月签订的文件的话，就根本不会有‘越南问题’了。”
    这家柬埔寨“人民社会同盟”的机关刊物在社论中指出：有些人发出呼吁，“要求交战各方举行谈判，说得更精确一些是要被侵略者和侵略者举行谈判，然而，他们却一点也不理会十二年前在日内瓦签字的东西。”
    社论说：“人们有权怀疑，这些愿出来‘斡旋’的政府和人士，究竟是不是真的了解日内瓦协议和一九五四年以来南越的情况。如果了解的话，只要给华盛顿一个短短的照会，要求美国从南越撤出他们的军队和基地，以履行他们竟然胆敢提到的协议就够了。”
    社论指出：南越战争实质上是“人民反抗一个外国所强加的历届政府”。它说，“我们今天不能容许美国军队阻止南越人民来决定他们自己的未来，那怕是用武力。”
    社论说：美国也知道，它对南越的军事占领是违反日内瓦协议和联合国宪章的。美国说什么它是保卫一个所谓遭受“外来侵略”的国家，这说法当然是荒谬的。
    社论说：“美国已经陷入困境。美国只有回到日内瓦协议的文字和精神的道路上来，它才能摆脱困境。条件就是美国再也不提新的解释来保持它在那里的军队和基地。”
    社论最后说：“不幸，很明显，五角大楼的狂人硬是一味要把南越变成进攻中国的军事基地。这就是问题的症结所在，而这个问题是不能谈判的，也是得不到解决的。”
