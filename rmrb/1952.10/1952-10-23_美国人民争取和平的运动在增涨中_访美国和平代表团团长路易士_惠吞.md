    Mr. Louis Wheaton, head of the American delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, is a black machinist. He is young, energetic, and radiates enthusiasm for the cause of peace. During the peace conference, he was one of the chairmen of the presidium and one of the deputy secretaries-general of the conference. He delivered a report on the five major powers concluding a peace pact on behalf of the conference, and led the working group on this issue. Despite his busy schedule, he took the time to meet with reporters twice to introduce the struggles of the American people for peace.
    Mr. Wheaton said: The American people's movement for peace only began to develop significantly early last year. Prior to this, some people were misled by the US government's war propaganda and still believed that expanding armaments and preparing for war were for so-called "defense" and could solve the domestic unemployment crisis. However, in the war of aggression against Korea, many Americans tasted the bitter fruits of expanding armaments, preparing for war, and war itself. They gradually awakened and began to realize that the ruling class's war propaganda was deceiving them. Since January of last year, the American people's sentiment against war and demanding peace has been rising day by day. Many people wrote letters to newspapers demanding an end to the Korean War. Many family members of soldiers who died in the Korean War refused to accept the medals given to their sons by the government, expressing their disgust for this "dirty war"; hundreds of pilots refused to fly; and young students also launched a movement against military training. Mr. Wheaton said: The father of an American soldier who invaded Korea, based on the list of captured soldiers and their addresses published in the newspaper, wrote letters mobilizing their family members to collect signatures demanding an end to the Korean War, and collected nearly one million signatures in just a few weeks. Robert Thompson, a famous leader of the American peace movement, wanted to go to Canada to attend a peace conference held in Canada. The US government did not issue him a passport. As a result, more than 40,000 American and Canadian people gathered at the border between the two countries to hold a grand protest demonstration. Mr. Wheaton said: "But these are only spontaneous struggles, they are unorganized. We want to unite all the forces for peace in the United States more broadly." He emphasized that the main task of American peace movement workers at present is to promote the close integration of the American peace movement with the American people's struggle for their vital interests.
    Mr. Wheaton is also a trade union worker, so he is particularly familiar with the development of the peace movement among American workers. He said: "The American left-wing unions are fighting for the interests of the workers, and they actively support peace policies. For example, the leader of the United Electrical Workers Union firmly demanded an end to the Korean War; the resolution passed by the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union at its recent annual meeting specifically pointed out the importance of striving for peace. Many other progressive independent unions have also expressed their opposition to the massacre in Korea. The vast membership of the right-wing unions is increasingly dissatisfied with their upper-level leaders' pursuit of Truman's war policy, and their opposition to the war is reflected in the continuous strikes over the past year. Even some leaders of the AFL and CIO, such as Ernst and Rosenblum, have expressed their opposition to the Korean War and demanded peaceful policies. A Northwest Carpenters Union affiliated with the AFL once demanded trade with China, advocating opening the door to trade through consultation." Mr. Wheaton excitedly said that the workers of the Detroit Ford Motor Factory Union (ie, CIO Local 600) had continuously launched struggles against the reactionary policies of the American ruling group and the CIO's upper-level leadership's betrayal of the workers' interests. He said: "Local 600 is a militant organization that frequently struggles to defend the interests of workers—such as fighting for reasonable wages, opposing speed-up systems, and demanding safety equipment. The American ruling group regards it as a thorn in its side, and the so-called 'Un-American Activities Committee' came forward to persecute several progressive leaders of this union, falsely accusing them of engaging in 'un-American activities.' The head of the CIO, Murray, even revoked their leadership position and established an executive committee to usurp the leadership of the union. But the workers firmly supported those progressive leaders who sought their welfare and voted to re-elect them as leaders of the union in the re-election. The victory of their struggle this time had a great impact on the workers of other unions, encouraging them to bravely engage in political struggle." Mr. Wheaton said: "The political nature of the American workers' struggle is gradually increasing. For example, the recently concluded 600,000-strong steelworkers' strike, in addition to the economic purpose of demanding increased wages, also had the political purpose of opposing the war; although the result of this strike did not result in a large increase in wages, it severely hit the American plan to expand armaments and prepare for war." This warrior of the peace movement and the workers' movement seemed to be concluding by saying: "The peace movement has begun to develop among the workers, but it still needs to be consolidated and strengthened, and the American peace movement should be truly based on the working masses."
    After a moment of contemplation, Mr. Wheaton began to talk about the tragic experiences of black people under the policy of racial discrimination in the United States. He said in a heavy tone:
    "Black people in the United States have always been subjected to cruel oppression and exploitation. With the intensification of war preparations, the fascist violence against black people is becoming more and more severe. The activities of the Ku Klux Klan are rampant not only in the South but also in the North. The American ruling authorities are also using 'legal' means to carry out disguised lynching against black people, adding various fabricated crimes to many black people and putting them to death." He went on to say: "Black people do not approve of war. Some people do not deeply hate war because they were able to get jobs that they could not normally get during the First and Second World Wars, but when it is pointed out to them that the result of war will only bring them more cruel oppression and exploitation, they will easily understand." Many outstanding black leaders have done a lot of work in enlightening and uniting black people to fight for freedom and peace. For example, the famous singer Robeson spreads the voice of black people demanding liberation and peace through the "Freedom News" he runs, and on the other hand, educates the black masses to strengthen unity and fight. He also frequently calls on the people to rise up to fight for peace, demand an end to the Korean War, and oppose bacteriological warfare and the atrocities of massacring prisoners of war at mass gatherings. He recently often sings a famous song symbolizing the unity and cooperation of all nationalities, "Four Great Rivers" (referring to the Volga, Yangtze, Hudson, and Thames Rivers), which is welcomed by the broad masses. Another famous black leader, the historian Du Bois, also frequently publishes articles in newspapers or speaks to the masses, criticizing the American government's war policy for leading the people to death. The chairman of the "American Civil Rights Protection Committee," Patterson, submitted a document entitled "We Accuse Genocide" to the United Nations, accusing the American government of persecuting black people and exposing the ferocious faces of American racists to the world. Another example is the black women's leader, the Progressive Party vice-presidential candidate, Mrs. Bass, who is also an outstanding fighter for peace and freedom. She takes the demand for equality, freedom, democracy, and peace as the main content of her election platform.
    The awakening of black people is increasing day by day, and unity is increasing day by day. They established the "American Black Labor Conference" last year. This organization has won the support of black people and other progressives across the country. It has carried out many struggles against racial discrimination and to protect the interests of black people, and has achieved many successes. For example, it has won great victories in securing employment opportunities for black people. This organization not only unites the vast number of black workers and mobilizes them to actively participate in the struggle for freedom and peace, but also strengthens the unity of working people of all races, and also plays a great role in expanding the American peace movement. Mr. Wheaton said with confidence: "In your country, national equality and great unity have been realized, and in our country, it will surely be realized in the future."
    Mr. Wheaton finally said: "This Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will undoubtedly have a great inspiring effect on the American peace movement. Our delegation has broad representation, so after returning home, we can contact the broad masses and convey the achievements of the conference to them." Speaking of his feelings about the peace conference, he said excitedly: "This conference is the most successful and most democratic conference I have ever attended in my life. It was conducted in an atmosphere full of brotherly love. Every representative had full freedom and time to express his opinions after consideration, so that all complex issues could be resolved satisfactorily. This proves that the people of the world can solve all existing problems through consultation. This historic conference is a heavy blow to the plans of the warmongers, and it will greatly encourage the people of all countries to fight for peace. This sentiment is growing rapidly in the United States, and we can expect a new upsurge in the American peace movement to arrive soon."

    美国人民争取和平的运动在增涨中
    ——访美国和平代表团团长路易士·惠吞
    本报记者　谭文瑞
    参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的美国代表团团长路易士·惠吞先生，是一位黑人机械师。他很年青，精力充沛，对争取和平的事业洋溢着热情。在和平会议期间，他是主席团的主席之一，又是大会的副秘书长之一；他代表大会作了关于五大国缔结和平公约的报告，并领导关于这个问题的小组委员会进行工作。他虽然很忙，却抽出时间两次接见记者，介绍了美国人民为争取和平而斗争的情况。
    惠吞先生说：美国人民争取和平的运动，从去年初才有了显著的发展。在此以前，有些人因为受了美国政府战争宣传的蒙蔽，还相信扩军备战是为了所谓“防御”，并可以解救国内的失业危机。但是，在侵略朝鲜的战争中，许多美国人尝到了扩军备战和战争带来的恶果，他们才逐渐醒悟过来，开始认识统治阶级的战争宣传是欺骗他们。去年一月以来，美国人民反对战争、要求和平的情绪，一天天高涨，许多人民写信给报纸，要求停止朝鲜战争。许多在朝鲜战死的士兵的家属，拒绝接受政府发给他们儿子的勋章，表示他们对这个“肮脏的战争”的憎恶；好几百飞行员不肯飞行；青年学生也展开了反对受军事训练的运动。惠吞先生说：有一个侵朝美军士兵的父亲，根据报纸上发表的被俘士兵的名单和地址，写信动员他们的家属去征集要求停止朝鲜战争的签名，在短短几个星期内就收集了近一百万个签名。美国著名的和平运动领袖罗伯逊要到加拿大去参加在加拿大举行的和平会议，美国政府不发给他护照，结果有四万多美国人民和加拿大人民聚集在两国边境举行了一次盛大的抗议示威。惠吞先生说：“但是这些都只是自发的斗争，是没有组织的，我们就是要更广泛地把美国一切拥护和平的力量团结起来。”他强调美国和平运动工作者当前的主要任务是促成美国和平运动与美国人民争取切身利益的斗争密切相结合。
    惠吞先生又是一个工会工作者，因此他对于和平运动在美国工人群众中开展的情形特别熟悉。他说：“美国的左翼工会是为工人的利益而斗争的，它们积极支持和平政策。像联合电气工人工会的领袖，就坚决要求停止朝鲜战争；矿山及冶炼工人工会在最近一次年会中通过的决议特别指出了争取和平的重要性。其他许多进步的独立工会，也纷纷表示反对在朝鲜进行的屠杀。右翼工会广大的会员群众对于他们的上层领导分子追随杜鲁门的战争政策日益不满，他们反对战争的情绪反映在一年来接连不断的罢工中。甚至劳联和产联的一些领袖，如恩斯特、罗山勃伦等也表示反对朝鲜战争，要求采取和平政策。劳联所属的一个西北部木工工会曾要求与中国进行贸易，主张以协商的方式打开贸易的大门。”惠吞先生兴奋地说，底特律福特汽车工厂工会
    （即产联第六百地方工会）的工人，为反对美国统治集团反动政策和产联上层领导出卖工人利益的行为，曾不断展开了斗争。他说：“第六百地方工会是一个富有战斗性的组织，它经常为保卫工人的利益——如争取合理工资、反对赶快制度、要求安全设备等——进行斗争。美国统治集团把它看作眼中钉，由所谓‘非美活动委员会’出面对这个工会的几位进步领袖进行迫害，诬指他们有进行‘非美活
    动’的嫌疑。产联的首领莫莱竟取消他们的领导地
    位，另成立一个执行委员会篡夺该工会的领导权。但是工人们却坚决拥戴替他们谋福利的那几位进步领袖，在改选的时候又投票把他们重选为工会的领导者。他们这一次斗争的胜利，对其他工会的工人发生了很大的影响，鼓舞他们勇敢地投身于政治斗争。”惠吞先生说：“美国工人斗争的政治性是逐渐增强了。例如：不久以前才结束的六十万钢铁工人大罢工，除了要求增加工资的经济目的外，同时有着反对战争的政治目的；这次罢工的结果虽然没有获得增加很多的工资，却严重地打击了美国扩军备战的计划。”这一位和平运动与工人运动的战士好像作结论似的说：“和平运动已开始在工人中发展起来了，但是还需要巩固和加强，应使美国的和平运动真正建立在工人群众的基础上。”
    惠吞先生沉思片刻之后，开始谈到美国黑人在种族歧视政策下的悲惨遭遇。他以沉重的声调说：
    “黑人在美国一直受着残酷的压迫和剥削。随着战争准备的加紧，法西斯分子对黑人的私刑暴行愈来愈厉害了。三K党的活动不仅在南方而且在北方也猖狂起来。美国统治当局并且以‘合法的’手段对黑人进行变相的私刑，以各种捏造的罪名加在许多黑人的身上，把他们处死。”他接着说：“黑人是不赞成战争的。有一些人因为在第一、二次世界大战中能够得到平时得不到的工作，对战争憎恨不深，但是当向他们指出战争的结果只会给他们带来更残酷的压迫和剥削时，他们便会很容易就明白过来了。”许多杰出的黑人领袖在启发和团结黑人起来争取自由与和平方面做了许多工作。例如著名的歌唱家罗伯逊通过他主办的“自由报”传播黑人要求解放与和平的呼声，另一方面教育黑人群众加强团结，进行斗争。他并且经常在群众集会中号召人民起来争取和平，要求停止朝鲜战争，反对细菌战和屠杀战俘的暴行。他最近常唱一支象征各民族团结合作的名曲“四条巨川”（按指伏尔加河、长江、哈德逊河和泰晤士河），受到广大群众的欢迎。另外一位著名的黑人领袖、历史学家杜波依斯也经常在报纸上发表文章或对群众演讲，斥责美国政府的战争政策把人民引向死亡。“美国民权保障委员会”的主席柏特逊曾将一个题名为“我们控诉灭种罪行”的文件送交联合国，控诉美国政府残害黑人的罪恶，向全世界揭露美国种族主义者的凶恶面目。又如黑人妇女领袖、进步党副总统候选人巴斯夫人也是一个卓越的和平与自由的斗士，她以要求平等、自由、民主与和平作为她的竞选纲领的主要内容。
    黑人的觉醒一天天在提高，团结一天天在加强，他们去年成立了“美国黑人劳工会议”。这个组织获得全国黑人和其他进步人士的支持。它曾为反对种族歧视、保卫黑人利益进行了许多斗争，而且得到不少的成就。例如给黑人争取就业机会，就得了很大的胜利。这个组织不仅团结了广大黑人劳工，动员他们积极参加争取自由与和平的斗争，并且加强了各种族劳动人民的团结，对于扩大美国和平运动也有很大的作用。惠吞先生满怀信心地说：“在你们的国家已经实现了民族的平等和大团结，在我们的国家中将来也一定要实现的。”
    惠吞先生最后说：“这次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，对于美国和平运动无疑将有极大的鼓舞作用。我们的代表团有广泛的代表性，因此回国后可以和广大的群众接触，向他们传达大会的成就。”谈到对和平会议的感想时，他兴奋地说：“这次大会是我有生以来所参加过的会议中最成功的一次，也是最民主的会议。它是在充满着兄弟般友爱的气氛中进行的。每个代表都有充分的自由和时间经过考虑以后表示自己的意见，所以能够使所有复杂的问题都得到了圆满解决。这证明世界人民是可以用协商的方式解决一切存在的问题的。这一次历史性的会议对于战争贩子的计划是一个沉重的打击，它将大大鼓舞各国人民争取和平斗争的情绪。这种情绪正在美国迅速成长，我们可以预料，美国和平运动的新高涨不久就会到来。”
