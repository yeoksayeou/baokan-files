Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 14th: The US side's flagrant interruption of the Panmunjom meeting has plunged the Korean armistice negotiations into an unprecedentedly serious crisis, further intensifying the world situation. Developments over the past five months clearly show that this is a premeditated step by the US side to systematically sabotage the armistice and expand the war.

In April of this year, only the issue of prisoner repatriation remained in the armistice negotiations. The hope for peace, threatening the orders and profits of the American capitalists, was closer than ever. Washington then resolved to sabotage the negotiations. The first step in their plan was to provoke on a large scale both inside and outside the meeting, hoping to force our side to abandon the negotiations; if this step failed, then they would openly interrupt the negotiations. According to Washington's timeline, the armistice conference had to be suspended before the UN General Assembly convened, in order to force other countries to support the US's plot to continue and expand the Korean War at the UN through a fait accompli.

In order to obstruct the achievement of an armistice, the US side representatives consistently insisted on the unreasonable demand to detain our captured personnel. The meeting records of the past five months are filled with various provocative actions by the American generals. They shamelessly pretended to be victors, saying that their unilateral demands were "final and unchangeable." They completely refused to negotiate, claiming "nothing to say" in many meetings. They repeatedly adopted the rogue-like method of walking out of the meeting midway, and later continuously insisted on adjourning for a week or ten days. Recently, as the deadline for Washington's predetermined interruption of negotiations gradually approached, they increasingly brazenly used the negotiation meetings as a megaphone for malicious abuse and political propaganda.

Outside the meeting, the US side exhausted all means to create a serious situation obstructing the resolution of the problem. They intensified the indiscriminate bombing of Korean civilians, carried out blatant and provocative large-scale air raids on peaceful towns along the Korean-Chinese and Korean-Soviet borders, and constantly dispatched aircraft to invade Chinese airspace. In the US POW camps, despite our repeated protests, prisoners continued to be massacred on a large scale. At the same time, the US side continued to violate the Panmunjom meeting area, systematically intensifying the use of the meeting area for espionage activities, attempting to create serious incidents and hinder the progress of the meeting.

However, these provocative actions by the US side all failed. Our side has always patiently insisted on negotiations, insisting on a principled resolution of the POW issue in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Therefore, Washington had to take the next step, defying world opinion, and openly interrupt the negotiations. The date was set for October 8, a week before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly.

In order to conceal this sinister premeditated step, the US side began to release smoke screens on September 28, putting forward a so-called "new proposal" that was nothing more than a change of dressing, and giving it great publicity. In fact, they knew that this proposal, which was essentially unchanged, could not solve any problems. Harrison, Clark, and Acheson had already prepared statements to interrupt the negotiations. At the meeting on October 8, Harrison brazenly announced an indefinite adjournment, and walked away without waiting for our side to speak. Although the US side claimed this was an "adjournment," they put forward extremely arrogant conditions for resumption, to close the door to negotiations.

At the meeting on October 8, our chief representative, General Nam Il, unexpectedly presented a new proposal that accommodated the US side's views as much as possible and was fully sufficient to resolve the POW issue. This made the US side's systematic sabotage of the negotiations even more evident. The US side panicked and had to resort to the old trick of news censorship. Even a British Foreign Office spokesman said: "Britain has not heard anything about General Nam Il's proposal from the United Nations Command at all," but only received this information from the Xinhua News Agency's telegram broadcast from Beijing. It was not until a few days later that the American propaganda agency, the United States Information Service, had to reveal fragments of our proposal and tried to distort it.

The fifteen months of Korean armistice negotiations were thus abruptly buried by the US side. United Nations Secretary-General Lie has already faithfully arranged the next step for Washington, saying in his "World Situation" report to the United Nations General Assembly that countries must "share the burden in Korea more fairly." At the same time, American planes are increasingly frequently intruding into the airspace of Northeast China, provoking the powerful People's Republic of China. Obviously, driving soldiers from more countries to their deaths in a larger-scale war is Washington's next plan after interrupting the Korean armistice negotiations. However, this criminal plan of the US side is absolutely intolerable to peace-loving people all over the world. Since the US imperialists dare to openly antagonize the people of the world, they will make themselves more isolated, thereby inviting more tragic failures.

### 美方在联合国大会前夕中断朝鲜谈判是其预谋已久的扩大侵朝战争的步骤

    美方在联合国大会前夕中断朝鲜谈判是其预谋已久的扩大侵朝战争的步骤
    【新华社开城十四日电】美方悍然中断板门店会议，已把朝鲜停战谈判投入前所未有的严重危机，使世界局势更形紧张。近五个月来的事态发展，清楚地显示出这是美方有系统地破坏停战，扩大战争的一个预谋步骤。
    今年四月，停战谈判中只剩下了一个遣俘问题，和平的希望空前迫近地威胁着美国大资本家的订货与利润，华盛顿遂决心破坏谈判。其计划的第一步是在会内会外大规模地挑衅，希图以此迫使我方放弃谈判；这一步如果失败，则公开中断谈判。按照华盛顿的时间表，停战会议必须在联合国大会召开之前中止，以便用既成事实迫使其他国家在联大支持美国继续及扩大朝鲜战争的阴谋。
    为了阻挠停战的达成，美方代表始终坚持扣留我方被俘人员的无理主张。五个多月来的谈判会议记录，载满了美国将军们各式各样的挑衅行为。他们曾厚颜地冒充胜利者，说他们的片面强求是“最后的，不可更改的”。他们曾完全拒绝谈判，在许多次会议上声称“无话可说”。他们曾多次采用流氓式的中途逃会办法，后来更连续坚持休会一周或十天。最近，当华盛顿预定的中断谈判期限逐渐迫近时，他们更把谈判会议愈来愈肆无忌惮地当作恶意谩骂及政治宣传谰调的传声筒。
    在会外，美方更用尽方法造成阻碍问题解决的严重形势。他们对朝鲜平民加紧狂轰滥炸，对朝中及朝苏边境的和平城镇进行露骨挑衅的大规模空袭，不断地派遣飞机侵入中国领空。在美方的战俘营中，尽管我方一再抗议，战俘仍继续遭到大规模的杀戮。同时，美方更不断侵犯板门店会场区，有计划地加紧利用会场区进行特务活动，企图造成严重事件，阻碍会议的进行。
    但是，美方这些挑衅行为都失败了，我方始终耐心地坚持谈判，坚持按日内瓦公约有原则地解决战俘问题。因此，华盛顿不得不采取下一步，冒天下之大不韪，公开中断谈判。日期就定在联合国大会开幕前一周——十月八日。
    为了掩饰这恶毒的预谋步骤，美方在九月二十八日开始施放烟幕，提出一个换汤不换药的所谓“新方案”，大事渲染。事实上，他们明知这个实质一成不变的方案是不能解决任何问题的。哈利逊、克拉克、艾奇逊都早已准备好了中断谈判的声明。在十月八日的会上，哈利逊遂悍然宣布无限期休会，不顾我方还要发言就扬长而去。虽然美方号称这是一个“休会”，但他们提出了极端狂妄的复会条件，来关死谈判之门。
    在十月八日的会上，我方首席代表南日将军恰恰出乎美方意料，提出了一个尽量容纳美方意见、完全足以解决战俘问题的新方案。这就使得美方有系统地破坏谈判的阴谋愈为显明。美方慌了手脚，只好采用新闻封锁的老办法。连英国外交部发言人都说：“英国从联合国军处完全没有听到南日将军的提案”，而是从北京广播的新华社电讯中才得到这个消息的。直到隔了几天之后，美国的宣传机关美国新闻处才不得不透露片段的我方方案，并力图加以歪曲。
    十五个月的朝鲜停战谈判，就这样猝然被美方埋葬了。联合国秘书长赖伊已经在忠顺地替华盛顿布置下一步，在他给联合国大会的“世界形势”报告中，他说各国必须“更公平地分任在朝鲜的负担”。同时，美国飞机正日益频繁地侵入中国东北领空，向强大的中华人民共和国寻衅。显然，驱使更多国家的士兵到更大规模的战争中送死，正是华盛顿中断朝鲜停战谈判后的下一步计划。但是，美方的这种罪恶计划，是全世界爱好和平人民绝对不能容忍的。美帝国主义者既敢于公然与世界人民为敌，他们将使自己更加孤立，从而招致更悲惨的失败。
