To the United Nations at Lake Success, New York:

    The United Nations was established to save mankind "from the scourge of war."
    The Charter of the United Nations stipulates that its duty is to maintain world peace and security and to prevent wars of aggression. However, in the seven years since its establishment, the United Nations has not only violated the principles of the Charter and failed to fulfill its responsibilities, but the war in Korea is being carried out in the name of the United Nations itself. This war has caused large-scale destruction to peaceful Korean villages and cities, and the Korean people and territory have suffered unprecedented bombing and atrocities. Furthermore, in violation of international law, international agreements, and all humanitarian principles, bacteriological warfare is being waged in Korea and Northeast China.
    The Charter of the United Nations respects the equal rights of all nations, recognizes the right of national independence, and the inviolability of national sovereignty. However, the United Nations has repeatedly violated this principle. It has condoned the suppression of national liberation movements in many countries, permitted interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and allowed the sovereignty of many countries' territories, territorial waters, and airspace to be violated. The United Nations has failed to safeguard the sovereignty and equal rights of many Asian and Pacific countries that are fighting for national liberation. For example, for several years it has allowed cruel wars to be waged in Vietnam, Malaya, and other countries, without making efforts to stop this slaughter.
    The United Nations has the obligation to implement and supervise international disarmament, but it has completely failed to fulfill this obligation. On the contrary, the United Nations has allowed several countries to massively expand their armaments and prepare for war. The entire economic burden caused by rearmament has fallen on the people of many countries, thereby lowering the living standards of the people in some countries, while causing boundless poverty and suffering to the people in others.
    The United Nations has not fulfilled its obligation to promote normal international economic relations. Instead, it has allowed certain countries to implement blockades and embargoes in preparation for war, which has undermined normal international trade relations and led several countries to economic crisis. The United Nations has also failed to fulfill its obligation to promote friendly cultural exchanges among nations.
    Even the principle upon which the Charter of the United Nations is based, namely the principle of unanimity among the five major powers, has been undermined.
    Only through consultation among the five major powers can the current international tensions be eased and lasting peace be guaranteed, but the United Nations tolerates the behavior of those countries that deny this principle in order to manipulate its discussions and decisions.
    The United Nations' refusal to allow the People's Republic of China, representing 475 million people, to enter the United Nations and the Security Council further undermines the principle of unanimity among the five major powers.
    The violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the United Nations' failure to maintain peace are not the responsibility of all member states of the United Nations. The primary responsibility for violating the Charter lies with the governments of a very small number of countries, headed by the United States government.
    This situation has aroused deep concern among the governments of many countries and the people of the world. Therefore, the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, attended by 404 representatives and observers from 37 countries, representing the common will of 1.6 billion people in the region to demand peace, submits the following recommendations to the United Nations:
    (1) The United Nations should condemn the act of fostering the revival of militarism in Japan and West Germany. The United Nations should also condemn the conclusion of unilateral treaties with Japan and West Germany aimed at preparing for war, and should use its influence to urge the countries concerned to conclude fair and genuine peace treaties with Japan and Germany. In order to ensure peace, the United Nations should support the Japanese people in establishing an independent, democratic, free, and peaceful new Japan, and support the German people in establishing an independent, unified, democratic, free, and peaceful new Germany.
    (2) The United Nations should immediately facilitate the implementation of a Korean armistice agreement on a fair and reasonable basis. The unreasonable action of the U.S. armistice negotiation representatives in unilaterally suspending the Korean armistice negotiations must be stopped; all prisoners of war on both sides must be unconditionally repatriated in accordance with the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention; all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, must be withdrawn; the Korean people must be allowed to freely resolve their internal problems in their own way.
    (3) The United Nations should take effective measures to ensure the withdrawal of all foreign troops to end the wars being waged in Vietnam, Malaya, and other countries; and to achieve a fair and reasonable solution through consultation to meet the legitimate demands of the aforementioned countries for national independence.
    (4) The United Nations should take action to stop the suppression of national independence and liberation movements in various countries, to stop racial discrimination, to stop interference in the internal affairs of various countries, and to stop the plunder of the resources of various countries. The United Nations should stop the act of forcing aggressive military treaties that violate the national interests of certain countries upon these countries, and should eliminate all foreign military bases in all regions.
    The United Nations must take action to respect and guarantee the right of national independence of the countries in the Near East and the Middle East, and to prevent infringement upon the sovereignty of these countries.
    (5) The United Nations should immediately implement the principle of unanimity among the five major powers, and promote the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and France. All countries are free to participate in this pact. The United Nations should insist on adopting consultation methods to resolve international disputes.
    (6) The United Nations should take effective measures to guarantee the implementation of universal and supervised disarmament, to prohibit the manufacture and use of bacteriological weapons, atomic weapons, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and to urge countries that have not yet ratified the June 17, 1925 Geneva "Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare" to ratify it immediately.
    (7) The United Nations must take effective measures to restore normal economic and cultural relations among countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. All obstacles that hinder normal economic relations, including embargoes and blockades, should be removed.
    The people of the Asian and Pacific regions believe that countries with different social systems and different ways of life can coexist peacefully, and hereby call on all member states of the United Nations to guarantee and implement all the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Only in this way can the United Nations restore its lost prestige and become an authoritative body for maintaining world peace.
    The people firmly demand that the United Nations save mankind from the scourge of war.
                                Asian and Pacific Peace Conference
                                October 12, 1952, Beijing

    致联合国书纽约成功湖联合国大会：
    联合国是为了拯救人类“免于战祸”而建立的。
    联合国的宪章规定它的职责在于维护世界和平与安全及阻止侵略战争。但是，联合国自成立七年以来，不但违反了宪章的原则，未能履行它的职责，而且在朝鲜的战争正是用联合国本身的名义进行的。这个战争，使朝鲜的和平的乡村和城市，遭到大规模的毁灭，使朝鲜的人民和领土遭遇到史无前例的滥炸与暴行。并且违反国际法和国际协定以及一切人道原则，细菌战争正在朝鲜和中国的东北进行着。
    联合国宪章是尊重各民族平等的权利，承认各民族独立的权利和各国主权的不可侵犯性的。但是，联合国一再违反了这一原则，它纵容了对于许多国家民族解放运动的镇压，容许对于别国内政的干涉，容许很多国家的领土、领海、领空主权受到侵犯。联合国对于正在为民族解放而斗争的许多亚洲和太平洋国家的主权和平等权利没有加以保障。例如，几年以来，它让残酷的战争在越南、马来亚等国进行，并没有努力来停止这种屠杀。
    联合国负有执行和监督国际裁减军备的义务，但它完全没有履行这项义务。相反地，联合国却容许好些国家大量扩张军备和准备战争。重整军备所引起的全部经济负担已经落到许多国家人民的身上，因而降低了某些国家人民的生活水平，而使另外一些国家人民受到无限的穷困和苦难。
    联合国没有执行它促进正常国际经济关系的义务。它反而容许某些国家实行封锁和禁运，来准备战争，这就破坏了国际间正常的贸易关系，并使若干国家走向经济危机。联合国也没有执行它促进国际间友好的文化交流的义务。
    就连联合国宪章所赖以建立的原则，即五大国一致的原则，也被破坏了。
    只有通过五大国协商才能够解除目前国际的紧张局势和保障持久和平，但是联合国却容忍那些为了要操纵它的讨论和决定而否认这个原则的国家的行为。
    联合国拒绝代表着四亿七千五百万人民的中华人民共和国进入联合国和安全理事会，这就更进一步破坏了五大国一致的原则。
    联合国宪章遭到破坏，联合国没有能够维持和平，这都不是联合国一切会员国的责任。破坏宪章的主要责任在于以美国政府为首的极少数几个国家的政府。
    这种情况，引起了许多国家的政府和全世界人民的深切关怀。因此，有三十七个国家的四百零四个代表及列席代表参加的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，代表着本区域十六亿人民要求和平的共同意志，向联合国提出下列建议：
    （一）联合国应谴责扶植日本和西德的军国主义复活的行为。联合国也应当谴责与日本和西德缔结旨在准备战争的片面和约，并应运用其影响，促使有关各国与日本和德国缔订公平和真正的和约。为了确保和平，联合国应支持日本人民建立一个独立、民主、自由、和平的新日本，支持德国人民建立一个独立、统一、民主、自由、和平的新德国。
    （二）联合国应在公平合理的基础上立即促使朝鲜停战协定实现。美国停战谈判代表片面中止朝鲜停战谈判的无理行动，必须停止；双方全部战俘，必须依据一九四九年日内瓦公约的规定，实行无条件遣返；一切外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军在内，必须撤退；朝鲜人民，必须让其自由地用他们自己的方法来解决他们的内部问题。
    （三）联合国应采取有效措施，来保证一切外国军队的撤退，以结束在越南、马来亚及其他国家进行的战事；并通过协商来达成公平合理的解决，以满足上述各国争取民族独立的合理要求。
    （四）联合国应采取行动，制止镇压各国民族独立与解放运动的行为，制止种族歧视，制止对各国内政的干涉和对各国资源的劫掠。联合国应制止把违反某些国家民族利益的侵略性的军事条约强使这些国家接受的行为，并使所有地区的外国军事基地一概撤消。
    联合国必须采取行动，以尊重与保证近东、中东各国民族独立的权利，并防止侵犯这些国家的主权。
    （五）联合国应立即执行五大国一致的原则，促成五大国——美国、苏联、中华人民共和国、英国和法国——和平公约的缔结。一切国家都可以自由参加这个公约。联合国应坚持采取协商的方法来解决国际争端。
    （六）联合国应采取有效措施，以保证实行普遍的、有监督的裁减军备，禁止制造和使用细菌武器、原子武器、化学武器和其他大规模毁灭性的武器，并促使尚未批准一九二五年六月十七日日内瓦“关于禁用毒气或类似毒品及细菌方法作战议定书”的国家，立即批准。
    （七）联合国必须采取有效措施，以恢复各国在平等互利基础上的正常的经济和文化关系。一切阻隔正常的经济关系的障碍，包括禁运与封锁在内，应加以撤除。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民，相信不同社会制度和不同生活方式的国家可以和平共处，特号召联合国各会员国家保证并执行联合国宪章的各项原则。只有这样，联合国才能恢复它已失去的威信，而成为维持世界和平的权威机构。
    人民坚决要求联合国拯救人类免于战祸。
                                亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
                                一九五二年十月十二日于北京
