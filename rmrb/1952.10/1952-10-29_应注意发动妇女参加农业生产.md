    Attention Should be Paid to Mobilizing Women to Participate in Agricultural Production
    Comrade Editor: I have recently been working in Lujiang County, Anhui Province, and have found that the leading cadres here do not pay much attention to mobilizing women to participate in production. Women here have never participated in production, and this situation has not changed much to this day. The mutual aid teams in the villages only have men participating in meetings, and women are not allowed to intervene. They say: What is the use of having them at the meetings? Women are often ridiculed if they go to the fields to work. One woman went to the fields to work, and it suddenly rained; some people said that the rain was caused by the woman going to the fields; the woman turned red with embarrassment and never dared to go to the fields again. The male members of the mutual aid team are also unwilling to have the women in their families participate in agricultural labor. When asked in the villages how many female laborers each mutual aid team has, they can give a number and say that they have implemented "equal pay for equal work, evaluation of work and recording of points"; in reality, very few women participate in major agricultural labor. Because the cadres do not attach importance to this issue, it is difficult for some women who want to participate in agricultural labor; if women have some difficulties, such as no one to take care of their children when they participate in production, the cadres do not help solve them. The Sun Lixian mutual aid team is organized by five households, with only five male laborers doing the work; to improve farming methods, it is necessary to mobilize women to participate in production. However, the wages calculated for women are too low, not equal pay for equal work; coupled with the fact that women themselves have many difficulties that cannot be solved, they are unwilling to actively participate in production. This is a great loss to agricultural production. County and district leading cadres should pay attention to solving this problem.

    应注意发动妇女参加农业生产
    编辑同志：我最近在安徽庐江县工作，发现这里的领导干部，很不注意发动妇女参加生产。这里的妇女向来不参加生产，这种情况至今没有什么改变。各村互助组开会，都是只有男人参加，不让妇女过问。他们说：要她们开会有什么用？妇女们偶然下田做活，要被许多人笑话。有一个妇女下田做活，天忽然下雨了，有人就说是妇女下田下坏了；这个妇女被说得满脸通红，以后再也不肯下田了。互助组的男组员也都不愿意自己家里的妇女参加农业劳动。到各村问各个互助组有几个女劳动力，他们也能说出个数目来，并且说实行了“同工同酬、评工记分”；实际上很少有妇女参加农业主要劳动。因为干部不重视这个问题，有些妇女想参加农业劳动，也就难了；妇女有些困难，如参加生产时孩子没人带，干部也不帮助解决。孙立贤互助组是由五户组织起来的，只有五个男劳动力做活；要想改进耕作方法，只有发动妇女参加生产。可是给妇女算的工资太少，不是同工同酬；再加上妇女本身有很多困难不能解决，都不愿意积极参加生产。这对农业生产是一个很大的损失。县区领导干部应当注意解决这个问题。
