    Chairman Bumantsendei's Telegram to Chairman Mao
    To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China:
    On the occasion of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please allow me, in the name of the Mongolian people, the Presidium of the Great People's Khural, and myself, to extend my most sincere congratulations to you and, through you, to the great Chinese people.
    The Mongolian people watch with sincere joy the new and remarkable achievements of the Chinese people, our great neighbor. Because People's China – a strong bulwark of peace in the Far East – its political and economic consolidation and its firm alliance with the great Soviet Union are reliable guarantees for the peace and security of all the people in the world.
    The peace-loving Mongolian people join the Chinese people in celebrating this significant festival and deeply wish the great Chinese people continued new victories in the construction of the national economy and culture and in the cause of fighting for world peace.
    In the name of the Mongolian people, I express the profound conviction that the fraternal friendship and close cooperation between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples are a valuable contribution to the cause of consolidating peace in the Far East.
    Bumantsendei, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic
    Ulaanbaatar, September 29, 1952
