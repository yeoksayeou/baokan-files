    The Yellow River is about to successfully weather its sixth major flood. This is a great victory in China's water conservancy construction under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and it is worthy of our joy and encouragement.
    However, the people's victory has come through arduous struggle. People all know that the Yellow River is the most serious disaster among the major rivers in the country. According to historical records of Yellow River floods, from 602 BC to 1949, there were seven major course changes, with an average of four breaches every ten years. Especially since the Republic of China, the dikes have been in disrepair, and the disasters of the Yellow River have intensified. Let's take the heinous act of Chiang Kai-shek breaching the Yellow River dike at Huayuankou during the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1938 as an example. At that time, it flooded 29,000 square kilometers of fertile land in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, drowned more than 325,000 working people, and countless people were displaced by the flood and died of hunger and disease. Moreover, the southward invasion of the Yellow River resulted in the siltation of the Huai River and its tributaries, thus causing the Huai River disaster. The severity of the disaster is unimaginable. From this, we can also see that the reasons for the Yellow River's disaster are not only natural conditions such as excessive sediment, riverbed siltation, small dry season flow, and large flood flow, but more importantly, the reactionary ruling class of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society neglected and destroyed water conservancy, thus causing a catastrophe for the people.
    With the victory of the People's Liberation War, the entire Yellow River belongs to the people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, millions of working people along the river have overcome various difficulties during the war and economic recovery periods and carried out tremendous Yellow River management work. The original dikes of the Yellow River in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, within the boundaries of Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces, had extremely weak flood resistance capabilities. According to expert research and statistics, based on the flow rate of Shanzhou, if the flood flow reaches 4,000 cubic meters per second, the downstream dikes may breach. If it reaches 10,000 cubic meters per second, the chance of downstream breaches reaches 70%. Therefore, carrying out massive repair, defense, and flood control work to protect the lives and property of the people has become our main task in the past six years. After six years of struggle, especially after the establishment of the Central People's Government, the Yellow River management work has made rapid progress. In terms of dike engineering, more than 1,300 kilometers of dikes have been repaired, completing more than 82 million cubic meters of earthwork. Tens of thousands of dams in the lower reaches have been changed from straw dams (sorghum stalks) to stone dams, completing more than 1.7 million cubic meters of stonework. Moreover, thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party organizations at all levels along the river and the People's Governments at all levels along the river, and the heroic work of farmers and workers, many beneficial experiences have been created, and work efficiency has been improved. Taking earthwork and stonework as an example, at the beginning, one worker could only complete about one cubic meter per day, but now the average for the entire line is two to four cubic meters per worker, increasing efficiency by about one to three times, saving the country a lot of resources. In order to consolidate the dikes, 4.89 million trees have been planted, 17.67 million clumps of grass have been planted, and 42,500 holes have been probed and filled. Considering that the downstream river channel cannot discharge extraordinary floods, and that ice dams often cause danger in the Lijin area of Shandong during the winter, the People's Government built flood diversion and overflow weir projects in Shitou Village, Changyuan County, Pingyuan Province, and Xiaojiezi, Lijin County, Shandong Province in 1951, to store and detain part of the floodwater and ensure the safety of the river. Due to the completion of the above tasks, the dikes have been greatly strengthened, and even when resisting extraordinary floods like the 23,000 cubic meters per second flow in Shanzhou in 1933, there is a solid foundation. Therefore, we have achieved safe passage through major floods for the sixth time this year, effectively protecting the agricultural production of the people on both sides of the Yellow River.
    In terms of water conservancy construction related to the Yellow River, it is also gradually being carried out. The larger-scale projects include the Huangyangzha project in Suiyuan Province and the Yellow River Irrigation Jiwei project in Pingyuan Province. The Yellow River Irrigation Jiwei project was completed this year according to the original plan; in addition to irrigating more than 400,000 mu of land this year, it can also maintain a Jiwei water volume of 10 to 20 cubic meters per second, facilitating shipping from Xinxiang to Tianjin, and also supplementing drought-resistant water for some areas along the Wei River in Hebei Province.
    In terms of fundamental preparation, we know that the ultimate goal of river management is to eliminate harm and promote benefits. In these six years of work, although we have successfully passed six major floods and achieved great achievements, the siltation of the Yellow River, the increased height of the riverbed, the constant changes, and the potential for the largest floods still threaten hundreds of millions of people in the three downstream provinces. At the same time, the Yellow River is the second largest river in China, with approximately 50 billion cubic meters of water and a drop of more than 4,000 meters, containing infinite water conservancy resources. If we fully develop it, it will play a great role in the development of industry and agriculture in the provinces along the Yellow River. Therefore, in order to completely eradicate the "harm" of the Yellow River and fully develop the "benefits" of the Yellow River, the fundamental work of the Yellow River remains our most important goal. Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, under the direct leadership of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, we have also done a lot of preparatory work in this regard. Basic tasks such as surveying, measuring, hydrology, sediment, and geological drilling investigations of the Yellow River have made significant progress, laying the foundation for fundamental work.
    From the above aspects of work, we deeply realize that without the leadership of the Communist Party, without the great revolutionary movements such as land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and without the heroic struggle of the broad working people, it would have been impossible to achieve the above achievements. Therefore, we fully believe that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, we will certainly be able to fundamentally manage the Yellow River, which is known as the most difficult river to manage in the world, and make it serve the Chinese people docilely.

    人民的新黄河黄河
    黄河水利委员会主任  王化云
    黄河即将胜利度过第六次大汛；这是在毛主席及中央人民政府英明领导下的我国水利建设事业中的一件伟大的胜利，值得我们欢欣鼓舞。
    但是人民的胜利是经过了坚苦的斗争的。人们都知道黄河在全国的大河流中是为患最严重的一条河流。根据黄河泛滥的历史记载，从纪元前六○二年到一九四九年，大改道七次，平均每十年决口四次。特别是民国以来，堤防失修，黄河的灾患变本加厉。我们拿一九三八年抗日战争时期蒋介石扒开花园口黄河大堤这一罪恶行为来看，当时曾淹没了豫、皖、苏三省两万九千平方公里的肥沃土地，淹死了三十二万五千余劳动人民，因水灾而流离失所死于饥饿疾病的人民，更不计其数，而且黄河南侵的结果，淤淀了淮河及其支流的河道，因而造成了淮河的灾害。其灾祸的惨重，真是不堪设想。从此也可以看出来黄河为患的原因，不仅是泥沙过多、河道淤淀、枯水小、洪水大等自然条件，更主要的是半殖民地半封建社会的反动统治阶级忽视与破坏了水利事业，因而造成了人民的浩劫。
    随着人民解放战争的胜利，黄河已全部属于人民。沿河千百万劳动人民，在共产党与人民政府的领导下，克服了战争时期与经济恢复时期的种种困难，进行了巨大的治黄工作。在黄河下游的河南、平原、山东三省境内黄河原来的堤岸，抵御洪水的能力是极为薄弱的。据专家研究统计，以陕州的流量为标准，如果洪水流量达到四千秒公方，下游大堤即有决口的可能。如达一万秒公方，则下游决口机会即达百分之七十。因此，进行巨大的修防与防汛工作，以保卫人民的生命财产，就成为我们六年以来的主要工作。经过六年来的斗争，特别是中央人民政府成立以后的时期中，治黄工作获得了迅速的进展。堤防工程方面，培修了一千三百余公里的大堤，完成了土方工程八千二百余万公方，下游数以万计的坝埽均由秸埽（高粱秆子）改为石坝，完成了石方工程一百七十余万公方。而且由于共产党沿河各级组织及沿河各级人民政府的领导，农民与工人的英勇工作，创造了许多有益的经验，提高了工作效率。就土方和石方工程来说，在开始时一个工一天只能做到一公方上下，现在全线平均一个工二至四公方，约提高效率一倍至三倍，为国家节省了大量资财。为了巩固堤防，又完成种树四百八十九万余株，植草一千七百六十七万余丛，锥探填补洞穴四万二千五百余个的任务。鉴于下游河道尚不能排泄超过寻常的洪水，同时在冬季时期，山东利津
    一带又常因冰坝阻水而发生危险，人民政府乃于一九五一年分别在平原省长垣县的石头庄、山东省利津县的小街子两地修建了溢洪堰与溢水堰工程，以蓄滞一部分洪水，保证大河安全。由于以上各项工作的完成，大大加强了堤防，即使在抵御像一九三三年陕州流量两万三千秒公方那样的异常洪水时，也有了巩固的基础。因之今年又第六次获得了大汛安澜，有力地保卫了黄河两岸人民的农业生产。
    在与黄河有关的水利兴修方面，也正在逐步开展，规模较大的工程，有绥远省境的黄杨闸工程与平原省境的引黄灌溉济卫工程。引黄灌溉济卫工程已于今年按照原定计划全部完成；除去今年可以浇地四十余万亩外，并且可以经常保持济卫水量十至二十秒公方，便利了新乡至天津的航运，也补助了河北省卫河沿岸一部分抗旱用水。
    在治本准备工作方面，我们知道治河的最终目的是除害兴利。在这六年的工作中，虽然我们胜利地度过了六次大汛，取得了伟大的成就，但由于黄河泥沙的淤淀，河道加高，变化无常，以及可能到来的最大洪水，依然威胁着下游三省的亿万人民。同时，黄河为我国第二大河，它有约五百亿立方公尺的水量，四千余公尺的落差，蕴藏着无穷的水利资源，如果我们予以全部开发，则对我国黄河沿岸各省工业农业的发展，将发挥伟大的作用。因此我们为了把黄河的“害”全部根除，把黄河的“利”全部开发，黄河的治本工作，仍然是我们一个最重大的目标。自中央人民政府成立以来，我们在中央人民政府水利部直接领导下，在这一方面也做了不少准备工作，对黄河的查勘、测量、水文、泥沙、地质钻探调查等各项基本工作，都有了长足的进展，为治本工作打下了基础。
    从上述几方面的工作来看，我们深刻体会到，如果没有共产党的领导，没有土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝、“三反”“五反”等伟大革命运动，没有广大的劳动人民的英勇斗争，要取得以上的成就是不可能的。因此我们完全相信，在毛主席及中央人民政府英明领导之下，一定能够将世界上号称难治的黄河，予以根本治理，使它驯服地为中国人民服务。（新华社）
