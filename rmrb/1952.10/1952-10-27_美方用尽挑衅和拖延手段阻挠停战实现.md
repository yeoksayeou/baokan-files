Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 26th: The Korean armistice talks officially began on July 10, 1951. After only two days of meetings, the US side interrupted the negotiations under the pretext of a reporter interview issue. Even American reporter Foster was dissatisfied, saying that the US side's "damned note interrupted the talks for such a trivial matter..." But this small matter caused the negotiations to be suspended for three days.

Subsequently, on the issue of the military demarcation line, the US side, because its arrogant demand to occupy 12,000 square kilometers of Korean territory was rejected, again interrupted the negotiations under the pretext of an accidental incident in which some of our guards mistakenly entered the meeting area. Although the US side also had similar incidents at the time, such as US soldiers firing towards Panmunjom, the entrance to the neutral zone, east of Kaesong on the afternoon of July 16, 1951, our side did not make an issue of it to obstruct the meeting. After the incident occurred, our side solemnly guaranteed to the US side that such incidents would not happen again and consistently kept its promise throughout the entire negotiation process. Our side's open and upright attitude and pure record throughout the entire negotiation process fully demonstrate our sincerity towards the armistice talks.

The US side's attitude was completely the opposite of ours. Throughout the entire negotiation process, whenever our side refused to accept the US side's unreasonable demands, the US side would employ its full repertoire of provocative incidents, undermining agreements, and creating unnecessary obstacles. Taking provocative incidents as an example, in 1951, when the negotiations on the military demarcation line were deadlocked due to the US side's insistence on unreasonable demands, the incidents of US aircraft attacking our delegation's convoy in violation of the agreement occurred on July 21st and August 7th; on August 19th, US armed personnel intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone and murdered Yao Qingxiang, platoon leader of our military police; on August 22nd, US aircraft strafed and bombed our delegation's residence; on August 30th, US armed personnel intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone, killing two of our military police and wounding one; on September 1st, US aircraft dropped two bombs near the residence of the chief representative of our delegation; on September 10th, US aircraft intruded into the vicinity of the Kaesong conference area and carried out strafing; on October 12th, US aircraft strafed the Kaesong neutral zone, killing a child named Jiang Yongdun. When the discussion of the third and fourth agenda items was deadlocked because the US side insisted on unreasonable demands, the incidents of US aircraft bombing and strafing the Kaesong neutral zone occurred on December 11th; this year, on January 17th, US aircraft intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone and carried out bombing; on January 18th, US aircraft strafed our delegation's convoy, wounding two people; on April 5th, US aircraft strafed our delegation's convoy, wounding nine people; on May 12th, US aircraft attacked our delegation's convoy, resulting in the death of our staff member Li Dongshu; on May 14th, US aircraft intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone, circled at low altitude, dropped flares, and strafed for as long as 55 minutes. The above are just the more important incidents. As for the incidents of US aircraft violating the agreement and intruding into the conference area, they are too numerous to count. Especially after the US side put forward the unreasonable plan to forcibly detain a large number of our prisoners of war, such provocative acts became even more intensified. During this period, the US side continuously shelled the conference area, and US aircraft continuously bombed our prisoner-of-war camps. Incidents of US aircraft violating the agreement and intruding into the Kaesong neutral zone also increased.

Regarding all these incidents, the US side invariably denied and shirked responsibility. For example, last August, it was clear that our side had captured US military personnel Park Rae-ryang and Kim Bong-deuk, who had sneaked into the neutral zone to commit crimes, but the US side fabricated stories, sometimes saying that the armed organization that invaded the Kaesong neutral zone was a "Republic of Korea citizen" organization, and sometimes saying that it was the work of some mysterious third party. Regarding the incident last year in which US aircraft bombed and strafed our delegation's residence, the US side vehemently denied it in the face of numerous witnesses and evidence, sometimes saying that the bomb fragments were blasted from underground, sometimes saying that they were fired by artillery, and sometimes saying that they were dropped from the sky; sometimes saying that there was no factual basis for the aircraft bombing, and sometimes saying that the US Fifth Air Force's radar had proven that aircraft did appear during the two bombings. In the end, it became increasingly bizarre, and they even said that all these incidents were fabricated by our side ourselves in order to assassinate our representatives. This is truly the behavior of a guilty conscience and utter disarray!

However, in the face of ample evidence, the US side had to repeatedly admit that they had violated the agreement. The important incidents they have admitted to include the US aircraft strafing or bombing the Kaesong neutral zone on September 10th, October 12th, December 11th of last year, and January 17th and May 14th of this year, as well as the shelling of the conference area on June 5th, August 2nd, September 28th, and October 8th of this year, and the US aircraft violating the agreement and intruding into the neutral zone on November 10th of last year, and February 24th, May 23rd, June 7th, August 10th, August 11th, August 16th, October 3rd, and October 8th of this year. These are just some of the ugly records of the US side's destructive negotiating behavior that they have had to admit in the face of irrefutable evidence. There are many more provocative and agreement-breaking incidents that the US side either flatly denies or uses the excuse of investigation, with no follow-up. However, the United States Information Service publicly lied on October 13th, saying that regarding the incidents of the US side damaging the neutral zone, "the results of the investigation found that almost every accusation was untrue." How clean the denial, and how shameless!

Under the coordination of these outside-the-meeting provocations, the US side adopted delaying tactics in the negotiations. On the issue of the military demarcation line, the US side successively proposed plans to seize our territory from July to November last year. On November 11th, the US side formally suggested that the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone be determined before the signing of the armistice agreement, which fundamentally overturned the second agenda item and canceled the conditions for the cessation of all hostilities in Korea. They obviously hoped to gain military advantage through their military offensive before the signing of the armistice agreement since they could not obtain military benefits at the negotiating table. This is their so-called sincerity for an armistice! In the discussion of the third agenda item, the US side attempted to continue to maintain its aggressive forces in Korea after the armistice and interfere in our internal affairs, restricting our construction of airports. On the issue of neutral nation nominations, the US side overturned the agreement that had been reached, advocating the replacement of six neutral nations with four, and unreasonably opposed the inclusion of the Soviet Union as a neutral nation. And the United States Information Service shamelessly lied on October 15th of this year, saying that the preliminary agreement reached by both parties was to form a neutral nation supervisory committee "with five countries," which is obviously a deliberate distortion of the facts.

On the prisoner-of-war issue, the US side's rogue tactics were even more varied and unscrupulous. The prisoner-of-war list they initially submitted only had names in English phonetics, without Chinese or Korean characters, and without specifying rank distinctions. They overturned the Geneva Convention and fabricated a principle of "voluntary repatriation," which in reality was the forced detention of prisoners of war. In order to forcibly detain prisoners of war, the US side used bayonets in their prisoner-of-war camps to forcibly "screen" prisoners of war, forcing prisoners of war to tattoo their bodies and write pledges in blood, creating one prisoner-of-war massacre after another, and finally, disregarding our warnings, unilaterally "released" 38,000 prisoners of war to the Syngman Rhee gang. In order to detain prisoners of war, they deliberately confused prisoners of war with political prisoners, arbitrarily inserting political issues into military negotiations. They deliberately violated the agreement and leaked the contents of administrative meetings. They put forward prisoner-of-war numbers that were created using "muddled" methods, forcing our side to accept them, and when their demands were not met, they yawned and dawdled at the conference table, repeatedly requesting three-day, seven-day, and ten-day recesses, and finally closed the door to negotiations by means of an indefinite recess.

Faced with the US side's provocations and obstruction, our side made the greatest possible concessions and forbearance. For example, on the issue of the military demarcation line, the demarcation issue was only resolved because our side proposed using the existing actual line of contact as the military demarcation line. Our side also proposed that if the actual line of contact does change before the signing of the armistice agreement, the initially determined military demarcation line could be revised. On the issue of designated ports, our side abandoned the demand for three ports per side and changed it to five ports per side. On the issue of neutral nation nominations, our side abandoned the six neutral nations originally agreed upon by both sides and agreed to the US side's demand for four neutral nations. On the issue of prisoners of war, because the US side said that there were South Korean personnel among our captured personnel, our side proposed a method of repatriation based on nationality and region. All of this fully proves that our side has done everything possible in the armistice negotiations and has made the greatest efforts to meet the world's urgent demand for an armistice in Korea.

It is precisely because of our side's sincerity and efforts that the entire draft armistice agreement has been agreed upon. Now, as long as both sides implement the agreement, the armistice can be realized immediately. But at this time, the US side refused to repatriate prisoners of war in accordance with Articles 51 and 52 of the draft agreement and brazenly closed the door to negotiations. This is clearly in order to realize its consistent conspiracy to maintain the stalemate in Korea. US Senator Ferguson revealed on October 19th that he had "obtained facts from the British government knowing that Truman had reached an agreement with former British Prime Minister Attlee to maintain the stalemate in the Korean War." According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on September 26th, US Republican Senator Jenner, when talking about the Korean armistice, said: The US government could have reached an armistice agreement a year ago, "but in order to maintain America's 'artificial prosperity,' it has stubbornly prolonged the war." The conspiracy of the American aggressors to delay and even sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations is so obvious that even those within the American aggressive clique have had to admit it. Isn't Acheson's and the United States Information Service's shameless denial in vain?

### 美方用尽挑衅和拖延手段阻挠停战实现

    美方用尽挑衅和拖延手段阻挠停战实现
    【新华社开城二十六日电】朝鲜停战谈判是在一九五一年七月十日正式开始的。才开了两天会，美方就藉口记者采访问题中断了谈判。连美国记者伏斯特都不满意地说，美方的“该死的照会为了这点鸡毛蒜皮的事就使和谈中断了……”可是这件小事就使谈判停了三天。
    接着，在军事分界线问题上，美方由于狂妄的侵占朝鲜一万二千平方公里土地的要求遭到拒绝，就藉口我方部分警卫人员误入会议地区的偶发事件，再度中断谈判。虽然当时美方也有同样事件发生，如一九五一年七月十六日下午在开城以东有美方士兵向中立区入口处板门店方向射击，但我方并未借题发挥，阻挠会议进行。我方在事件发生以后，就向美方郑重保证不再发生这种事件，并在整个谈判过程中始终遵守自己的诺言。我方这种光明磊落的态度和在整个谈判过程中的纯洁纪录，充分证明了我方对停战谈判的诚意。
    美方的态度却和我方截然相反。在整个谈判过程中，每当我方拒绝接受美方的无理主张时，美方就施展其挑衅寻事、破坏协议、节外生枝的全副破坏本领。拿挑衅事件来说，在一九五一年，当关于军事分界线的谈判因为美方坚持无理主张而陷于僵局的时候，就发生了七月二十一日和八月七日美机违反协议攻击我方代表团车队事件；八月十九日美方武装人员侵入开城中立区杀害我方军事警察姚庆祥排长事件；八月二十二日美机扫射轰炸我方代表团住所事件；八月三十日美方武装人员侵入开城中立区杀害我方军事警察二人，杀伤一人事件；九月一日美机在我方代表团首席代表住所附近投弹两枚事件；九月十日美机侵入开城会场区附近进行扫射事件；十月十二日美机扫射开城中立区杀死儿童姜永敦事件。在第三项议程和第四项议程的讨论因为美方坚持无理要求而陷于僵局时，就发生了十二月十一日美机在开城中立区投弹、扫射事件；今年一月十七日美机侵入开城中立区轰炸事件；一月十八日美机扫射我方代表团车队打伤二人事件；四月五日美机扫射我方代表团车队打伤九人事件；五月十二日美机袭击我方代表团车队，以致我方工作人员李东洙中弹牺牲的事件；五月十四日美机侵入开城中立区低空盘旋，投掷照明弹及扫射达五十五分钟之久的事件。上面所举的还只是比较重要的事件。至于美机违反协议侵越会场区的事件，那就更是数不胜数。特别在美方提出强迫扣留我方大批战俘的无理方案以后，这种挑衅行为更是变本加厉。在这个时期中，美方不断炮击会场区，美机连续轰炸我方战俘营。美机违反协议侵入开城中立区的事件也越来越多。
    对于所有这些事件，美方一味抵赖，推脱责任。例如去年八月间，明明我方已经捕获了潜入中立区行凶的美方军事人员朴来良、金凤得，美方却信口胡诌，忽而说侵入开城中立区的部队是当地的“大韩民国公民”的武装组织，忽而又说是什么神秘的第三者所为。对于去年美方飞机轰炸扫射我方代表团住所的事件，美方在许许多多人证物证面前极口抵赖，忽而说炸弹碎片是从地下炸出的，忽而说是大炮打来的，忽而又说是从天上扔下的；忽而说飞机轰炸毫无事实根据，忽而又说美方第五航空队的雷达已证明两次轰炸时确有飞机出现。说到最后，越来越离奇，竟说所有这些事件都是我方自己因为要谋杀我们的代表而自己制造出来的。这真是做贼心虚，狼狈万状！
    可是在充分的证据面前，美方不得不一再承认他们破坏协议。他们已经承认了的重要事件有去年九月十日、十月十二日、十二月十一日、今年一月十七日、五月十四日的美机扫射或轰炸开城中立区事件，还有今年六月五日、八月二日、九月二十八日、十月八日的炮击会场区事件，还有去年十一月十日、今年二月二十四日、今年五月二十三日、六月七日、八月十日、八月十一日、八月十六日、十月三日、十月八日的美机违反协议侵越中立区事件。这些就是美方在确凿的证据面前不得不承认的破坏谈判行为的一部分丑恶的纪录。还有更多的挑衅和破坏协议事件，美方或则矢口抵赖，或则藉口调查，永无下文。可是美国新闻处却在十月十三日公开撒谎说，关于美方破坏中立区的事件，“调查的结果发现几乎每一项指责都是不真实的”。抵赖得可真干净，也真是无耻！
    在这种会外挑衅配合之下，美方在谈判上采取了拖延战术。在军事分界线问题上，美方从去年七月到十一月接连提出妄想侵占我方地区的方案。到十一月十一日，美方又正式建议将军事分界线和非军事区留到停战协议签字之前再确定，这是根本推翻第二项议程，取消在朝鲜停止一切敌对行为的条件。他们显然因为在谈判桌上得不到军事利益，希望用他们的军事进攻在停战协议签字之前来得到它。他们的所谓停战诚意就是如此！在第三项议程的讨论中，美方企图在停战以后继续保持其在朝鲜的侵略力量，并干涉我方内政，限制我方修建机场。在中立国提名问题上，美方推翻已经达成的协议，主张以四个中立国代替六个中立国，毫无理由地反对以苏联为中立国。而美国新闻处竟然在今年十月十五日无耻地撒谎说双方达成的初步协议是“以五个国家”组成中立国监察委员会，这显然是蓄意歪曲事实。
    在战俘问题上，美方的流氓手段更是五花八门，无所不用其极。他们最初交来的战俘名单是只有英文拼音的名字的，既没有中文或朝鲜文，也没有注明职级区别。他们推翻日内瓦公约，捏造了一个
    “自愿遣返”实际上则是强迫扣留战俘的原则。为了强迫扣留战俘，美方在他们战俘营中用刺刀强迫
    “甄别”战俘，强迫战俘在身上刺字、写血书，制造了一次又一次的屠杀战俘事件，最后并不顾我方警告，片面“释放”三万八千名战俘给李承晚匪帮。他们为了扣留战俘，故意将战俘与政治犯混为一谈，凭空在军事谈判中插进政治问题。他们故意破坏协议，泄露行政性会议的内容。他们提出了用“糊里糊涂”的办法制造出来的遣俘数字，强迫我方接受，并且在要求达不到时，在会议桌上打呵欠、磨洋工，一再要求三天、七天、十天的休会，最后又用无限期休会的办法关上了谈判之门。
    面对着美方的挑衅和阻挠，我方作了最大限度的妥协与忍让。例如，在军事分界线问题上，只是由于我方提出以现有实际接触线为军事分界线，划线问题才得以解决。我方并提议在停战协议签字前如实际接触线确有变化时，已经初步确定的军事分界线可作修正。在特定口岸问题上，我方放弃每方三个口岸的主张，改为每方五个口岸。在中立国提名问题上，我方放弃双方原已协议的六个中立国的主张，同意美方的四个中立国的主张。在战俘问题上，由于美方说我方被俘人员中有南朝鲜籍人员，我方就提出按照国籍地区分类遣返的办法。凡此种种，充分证明我方在停战谈判中已经仁至义尽，为了满足世界人民对朝鲜停战的迫切要求，作了最大的努力。
    正是由于我方的诚意与努力，才使停战协定草案全部得到了协议，现在，只要双方按照协议执行，停战立即可以实现。但是就在这时候，美方拒绝按照协定草案第五十一款、五十二款遣返战俘，悍然关闭了谈判之门。这显然是为了实现其一贯的在朝鲜保持僵局的阴谋。美国参议员福开森十月十九日透露，他曾“从英国政府方面得到事实，知道杜鲁门曾与英国前首相艾德礼订立保持朝鲜战争僵局的协议”。另据法新社华盛顿九月二十六日电称，美国共和党参议员真纳在谈到朝鲜停战时说：美国政府本来在一年前就可以获致停战协议，“但为了要维持美国的‘人工的繁荣’，才硬把战争拖延下去。”美国侵略者拖延以至破坏朝鲜停战谈判的阴谋是如此明显，以致美国侵略集团中的人都不得不承认了，艾奇逊和美国新闻处的无耻抵赖难道不是徒劳么？
