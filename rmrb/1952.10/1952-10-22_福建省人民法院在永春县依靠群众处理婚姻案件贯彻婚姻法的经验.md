Editor's Note: This newsletter was written by comrades who personally led the inspection team and mobile court of Yongchun County, Fujian Province. They have gained better experience in implementing the mass line in the work of the people's judiciary. It is now introduced for reference by various places.

    Yongchun County, Fujian Province, has eight districts, one hundred and twenty-nine townships, and a population of 200,359. It is located in mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation. Until the second half of 1951, the feudal marriage system was still quite prevalent here. According to a survey of fifteen townships in the Second District at that time, among 8,995 women, there were 1,891 child brides, 85 "waiting-for-husband" girls, 1,307 widows, and also many barbaric marriage forms such as rented wives and pawned wives. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, the local Party and government organs made some efforts to publicize it, and some results were also achieved. In the fifteen townships, 73 widows remarried, and 178 unmarried child brides returned home. However, during the same period, there were 499 couples who were married by parental arrangement or by buying and selling.

    In October 1951, during the national inspection of the implementation of the Marriage Law, the Fujian Provincial People's Court, in coordination with relevant departments, organized three inspection teams and mobile courts for the implementation of the Marriage Law, which went to the three regions of northern Fujian, Minhou, and southern Fujian respectively to carry out work. Among them, the team to southern Fujian chose Yongchun County as an experimental area. On the one hand, it conducted in-depth inspections on the implementation of the Marriage Law, and on the other hand, it experimented with how to implement the mass line in judicial work when handling marriage cases. Before the departure of the inspection team, Zeng Jingbing, President of the Fujian Provincial People's Court, instructed the inspection team and the mobile court that they must handle cases for the broad masses of the people, and in handling cases, they must rely on the broad masses of the people and avoid passive courtroom trials.

    After the inspection team and the mobile court arrived in Yongchun County and investigated the marriage situation in Yongchun County, with the support of the CPC Jinjiang Prefectural Committee, the Jinjiang Commissioner's Office, the CPC Yongchun County Committee, and the Yongchun County People's Government, they launched a county-wide mass movement to handle marriage cases. The steps and methods for carrying out this movement are:

    1. Seize typical cases for public trial to educate cadres, mobilize the masses, and launch a mass judicial struggle. Xu Laicheng from Chongqi Township, Second District, Yongchun County, bought a child bride named Huang Xuan six years ago as his wife. Xu Laicheng often beat, scolded, and abused Huang Xuan. On September 23, 1951, Xu Laicheng beat Huang Xuan to death over a trivial matter. The Farmers' Association and the Democratic Women's Federation in the Second District were very indignant about this and demanded that the Yongchun County People's Government severely punish the murderer. The mobile court seized this case for handling: first, the handling opinions were printed and distributed to cadres in districts and townships throughout the county for discussion, and then representatives from each township were selected to participate in the public trial. More than 15,000 representatives from all districts and sectors of the county attended the public trial. The Marriage Law was vigorously publicized before the trial, and the masses were extremely angry during the trial, unanimously demanding the execution of the murderer. The special court organized by the mobile court sentenced Xu Laicheng to death based on the facts of Xu Laicheng's crime and the opinions of the masses. Through this public trial, approximately 80,000 district and township cadres and the masses were directly and indirectly educated. The public trial strongly supported the masses' struggle against the feudal marriage system, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses to strive for freedom of marriage was unprecedentedly enhanced.

    2. Obtain the unified leadership of the Party Committee and the support of the county and district people's governments, and convene an enlarged meeting of township cadres and activists throughout the county. Those who attended the meeting had suffered from the feudal marriage system, and some had unintentionally maintained the feudal marriage system. After the opening of the conference, a report was first made exposing the crimes of the feudal marriage system, explaining the importance of implementing the Marriage Law. Then, people who had suffered from feudal marriage persecution came forward to accuse. Many vivid facts educated all attendees, awakening some people who had unintentionally maintained the feudal marriage system. Then, township cadres and activists were organized to check their understanding of the Marriage Law and compare the advantages and disadvantages of the old and new marriage systems. During the inspection, township cadres revealed more than 110 marriage cases that had been handled improperly due to feudal remnants of thought. Next, the meeting further mobilized mutual exposure and reporting of violations of the Marriage Law and proposed typical cases for discussion. Then, various opinions were collected and several typical cases were pronounced on the spot at the meeting. This not only publicized the Marriage Law and educated the cadres, but also pointed out the correct direction for township cadres to handle marriage cases in the future. After returning, general district and township cadres took the initiative to convene mass meetings, women's meetings, husband and wife reconciliation meetings, bride and groom meetings, and child bride meetings to convey, organize discussions, and root the implementation of the Marriage Law in cadres and the masses.

    3. Absorb township cadres and activists to form temporary people's courts, and expand the mass case handling movement from point to area. After the enlarged meeting, the mobile court first used two districts as pilot projects, and carried out work in the Second and Fifth Districts respectively. The mobile court first convened a meeting of hundreds of activists at the District People's Government, mobilizing township cadres to conduct self-criticism and propose marriage cases that had been handled improperly; then, with seventeen cadres from the mobile court as the backbone, several hundred township cadres and activists were mixed to form several temporary people's courts, and one or two or three were sent to each township to handle marriage cases with the masses in each township. After arriving in the townships, these temporary people's courts also universally convened widow meetings, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law meetings, husband and wife reconciliation meetings, bride and groom meetings, and child bride meetings to conduct discussions, repeatedly publicize the Marriage Law, and mobilize the broad masses.

    The temporary people's courts were warmly welcomed by the masses, and the masses who came to the temporary people's courts every day were in a constant stream. The temporary people's courts handled cases and publicized at the same time. The masses rose up, and the handling of cases was also rapid and reasonable. After the marriage cases in these two districts were completed, the mass case handling movement was launched in the other five districts. In more than a month, seventeen cadres handled a total of 713 marriage cases, and another 83 cases were resolved verbally.

    The inspection team and the mobile court successively convened 102 meetings of all sizes in Yongchun, including county-level expanded cadre meetings, main cadre meetings of each district, farmer representative meetings, youth representative meetings, women's representative meetings, mass meetings, public trial meetings, and sentencing meetings. It is estimated that more than 150,000 people in 105 townships in seven districts (excluding the First District) were educated about the Marriage Law. Each person received education at least once, and up to six or seven times. Each district has basically eliminated the blind spots in publicizing the Marriage Law, and 314 men and women who were bound by the feudal marriage system have been liberated, and 218 families with disharmonious mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law and couples in disputes have been reconciled.

    The mobile court and the inspection team relied on cadres and the masses to propose many marriage cases, and with the assistance of the masses, they were quickly resolved one by one, and the combination of punishing criminals and enlightening the masses' self-education and preventing crimes was achieved, which improved the masses' policy and ideological level. Su Changjiang from Guanshan Township used to beat his wife frequently. Now he realizes that this is illegal and is determined to live in harmony with his wife. Wang Gang, a woman from Tangcheng Township, was sold to You Nanshan as a child bride at the age of six. She had lived for sixteen years under the beatings and abuse of her mother-in-law and husband without daring to resist. After the launch of this mass judicial struggle, she ended her painful life. A woman from Aonan Township was also a child bride. After marriage, she remained a widow for twenty years. Now she has a child bride. She said: "When the child bride grows up, I will let her have freedom of marriage. I will never let her suffer the hardships I have suffered." Now Yongchun County has implemented collective wedding ceremonies, and many widows have begun to marry freely, and the buying and selling of marriages has been effectively combated. After the masses' marriage problems have been reasonably resolved, their labor enthusiasm and production enthusiasm have been universally improved.

    福建省人民法院在永春县依靠群众处理婚姻案件贯彻婚姻法的经验
    庄申远　乐澄清
    编者按：这篇通讯是亲自领导福建省永春县检查组和巡回法庭工作的同志写的。他们在工作中取得了人民司法工作贯彻群众路线的较好的经验。现在介绍出来，供各地参考。
    福建省永春县共八个区，一百二十九个乡，人口二十万零三千三百五十九人。地处山区，交通不便。至一九五一年下半年，封建婚姻制度在这里还相当普遍地存在着。据第二区十五个乡当时调查，八千九百九十五个妇女中，有童养媳一千八百九十一人，等郎妹八十五人，寡妇一千三百零七人，租妻、典妻等野蛮婚姻形态也不少。中华人民共和国婚姻法颁布后，当地党、政机关曾努力作过一些宣传，也收到一些效果。在十五个乡中，寡妇结婚的有七十三人，未婚的童养媳回家的有一百七十八人。但同一时期，由父母包办结婚或是买卖婚姻的，却有四百九十九对。
    一九五一年十月全国检查婚姻法执行情况时，福建省人民法院配合有关部门组织了三个婚姻法执行情况检查组和巡回法庭，分别到闽北、闽侯、闽南等三个地区进行工作。其中赴闽南地区的，选择永春县作为实验地区。一面深入检查婚姻法执行情况，一面从处理婚姻案件中实验司法工作应如何贯彻群众路线。检查组出发前，福建省人民法院院长曾镜冰曾指示检查组和巡回法庭必须为广大人民办案，在办案中又必须依靠广大人民，避免被动的坐堂问案。
    检查组和巡回法庭到达永春县，调查了永春县的婚姻状况后，取得中共晋江地委、晋江专署、中共永春县委、永春县人民政府的支持，即在永春县开展了全县规模的群众性的办理婚姻案件运动，开展这一运动的步骤和方法是：
    一、抓住典型案件进行公审，以教育干部，发动群众，开展群众性的司法斗争。永春县第二区重岐乡徐来成，六年前买了一个名叫黄选的童养媳作妻子。徐来成时常打骂和虐待黄选。一九五一年九月二十三日，徐来成因为一点小事，就把黄选活活打死了。第二区农民协会和民主妇女联合会等团体对此十分愤慨，要求永春县人民政府严惩凶手。巡回法庭就抓住这个案件，进行处理：先把处理意见印发给全县区乡干部讨论，然后由各乡推派代表参加公审。公审大会举行时，到全县各区各界代表一万五千余人。审判前大张旗鼓地宣传了婚姻法，审判时群众情绪非常激愤，一致要求枪毙凶犯。巡回法庭组织的特别法庭根据徐来成的犯罪事实和群众的意见，判处了徐来成死刑。通过这一次公审，直接间接受到教育的区乡干部和群众约八万人。公审大会有力地支持了群众反封建婚姻制度的斗争，广大群众争取婚姻自由的积极性空前提高。
    二、取得党委统一领导及县、区人民政府的支持，在全县召开乡干部、积极分子扩大会议。到会的有身受封建婚姻制度压迫的，也有本身就有意无意维护封建婚姻制度的。大会开幕后，首先作了揭发封建婚姻制度罪恶的报告，说明贯彻婚姻法的重要性。然后由身受封建婚姻迫害的人起来控诉。许多活生生的事实教育了全体到会者，使一部分无意中维护封建婚姻制度的人警醒了过来。然后组织乡干部、积极分子分组检查对婚姻法的认识，对比新旧婚姻制度的好坏。在检查中，乡干部揭露出由于有封建残余思想而处理失当的婚姻案件一百一十余起。接着，会议又进一步发动互相揭发检举违反婚姻法的行为，提出典型案件来讨论。然后集中各种意见，在会上当场宣判几个典型案件。这样既宣传了婚姻法，教育了干部，又给乡干部指出了今后处理婚姻案件的正确方向。一般区、乡干部回去后，都主动地分别召开了群众大会、妇女会、小组会，进行传达，组织讨论，使婚姻法的贯彻执行在干部、群众中扎下了根。
    三、吸收乡干部及积极分子组成临时人民法庭，由点到面，展开群众性办案运动。扩大会议开过后，巡回法庭先以两个区作试点，分别到第二区、第五区展开工作。巡回法庭先在区人民政府召开了数百人的积极分子会议，发动乡干部自我检讨，提出处理失当的婚姻案件；然后以巡回法庭十七个干部为骨干，配合几百个乡干部和积极分子混合组成若干临时人民法庭，每个乡分别派遣一个或二、三个，与各乡群众一起处理婚姻案件。这些临时人民法庭到乡后，又普遍召开了寡妇会、婆媳会、夫妻和好会、新娘新郎会、童养媳会进行座谈，反复宣传婚姻法，把广大群众发动了起来。
    临时人民法庭受到了群众的热烈欢迎，每天到临时人民法庭来的群众川流不息。临时人民法庭一边办案、一边宣传。群众起来了，办案也迅速而合理了。这两个区的婚姻案件办完后，即在其他五个区展开了群众性的办案运动。在一个多月中，十七个干部共处理了七百一十三件婚姻案，另外口头解决八十三件。
    检查组和巡回法庭在永春先后召开县扩大干部会、各区主要干部会、农民代表会、青年代表会、妇女代表会、群众大会、公审大会、宣判大会等大小会议一百零二次。估计七个区（第一区除外）一百零五个乡有十五万以上的人民受到了婚姻法的教育。每人少则一次，多则六、七次。各区已经基本上消灭了宣传婚姻法的空白点，三百一十四对受封建婚姻束缚的男女得到了解放，二百一十八家婆媳不和、夫妻闹纠纷的家庭和睦了。
    巡回法庭和检查组依靠干部、群众提出许多婚姻案件，又在群众协助下一一迅速加以解决，并做到惩罚罪犯与启发群众自我教育、预防犯罪相结合，提高了群众的政策思想水平。观山乡苏昌降过去经常打老婆，现在认识到这是违法行为，下决心要和老婆和睦相处。汤城乡妇女王纲六岁时被卖给尤南山做童养媳，在婆婆、丈夫打骂虐待下过了十六年不敢反抗，在这次群众性司法斗争开展后，结束了痛苦的生活。鳌南乡一个妇女原来也是童养媳，结婚后守了二十年活寡，现在有一个童养媳，她说：“等童养媳长大后，我要让他婚姻自主。我吃过的苦，再不让她吃了。”现在永春县已实行了集体结婚仪式，不少寡妇开始自由结婚，买卖婚姻受到了有力的打击。群众在婚姻问题得到合理解决后，劳动热情和生产积极性普遍提高了。
