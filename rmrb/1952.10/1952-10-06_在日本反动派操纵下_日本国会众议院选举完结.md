Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 3rd: The election of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet was held on October 1st.

Before and during the election campaign, the Liberal Party took many measures to obstruct the democratic forces from participating in the election. The election law was revised. According to the new election law, the duration of the campaign was reduced from thirty days to twenty-five days, while the campaign fee to be paid by candidates was increased from 50,000 yen to 100,000 yen. The revised election law also restricted newspaper coverage and commentary on the general election. These measures were aimed at the Communist Party, because the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, and other bourgeois parties all had many publications serving them.

In addition, candidates of the Communist Party and democratic organizations were also subjected to open threats. From the beginning of the campaign, the bourgeois newspapers spread provocative rumors, saying that the Communist Party was about to launch "disturbances." Regarding this, Kyodo News Agency reported that the Japanese police were ordered to be ready to act at any time. In the course of the campaign, newspaper reports were full of news of the arrest of democratic candidates and their campaign staff.

During the election campaign, many violations of the election law occurred, mostly committed by representatives of the Liberal Party. Candidates of the bourgeois parties received significant financial support from large corporations and representatives of foreign capital.

According to preliminary materials, the four hundred and sixty-six seats in the House of Representatives are distributed as follows:

    Liberal Party – 240 seats
    Progressive Party – 85 seats
    Right-wing Socialist Party – 57 seats
    Left-wing Socialist Party – 54 seats
    Labor-Farmer Party – 4 seats
    "Cooperative Party" – 2 seats
    Small Parties – 5 seats
    Independents – 19 seats
Among the elected candidates, 136 were previously purged, that is, they were prohibited from participating in social activities because of their involvement in Japanese aggression.

Due to the anti-democratic election law and the obstacles created in front of the Communist Party candidates, the Communist Party, despite obtaining 822,540 votes, failed to win a single seat in the House of Representatives.

    在日本反动派操纵下
    日本国会众议院选举完结
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社东京三日讯：日本国会众议院的选举已于十月一日举行。
    在竞选运动之前和竞选运动期间，自由党采取了许多措施，阻挠民主势力参加选举。选举法被修改了。根据新的选举法，竞选运动的期间由三十天减为二十五天，同时候选人应缴纳的竞选费却由五万日元增至十万日元。经修改过的选举法又限制了报纸对于大选的报道及评论。这种措施是针对共产党的，因为自由党、改进党和其他资产阶级政党都拥有许多为他们服务的出版物。
    此外，共产党和民主组织的候选人还受到公开的威胁。从竞选运动一开始，资产阶级报纸就散布挑衅性的谣言，说共产党将要发动“骚乱”。关于这一点，共同通讯社曾报道说，日本警察奉命随时行动。在竞选运动进行的过程中，报纸的报道中充满了民主候选人和他们的竞选活动人员被捕的消息。
    在竞选运动中，发生了许多违反选举法的事情，大多数是自由党的代表们干的。资产阶级政党的候选人得到大公司和外国资本的代表们的重大资助。
    根据初步材料，众议院里的四百六十六个席位是这样分配的：
    自由党——二百四十席，改进党——八十五席，右派社会党——五十七席，左派社会党——五十四席，劳农党——四席，“协同党”——二席，小党派——五席，无党派人士——十九席。当选的候选人里有一百三十六名是先前被整肃的人，就是说，由于他们曾参与日本侵略，他们曾被禁止参加社会活动。
    由于反民主的选举法以及在共产党候选人面前所制造的障碍，共产党虽然获得八十二万二千五百四十张选票，但是在众议院中未能获得一个席位。
