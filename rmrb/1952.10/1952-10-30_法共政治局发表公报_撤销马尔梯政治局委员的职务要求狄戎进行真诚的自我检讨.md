Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 29th: TASS, Paris, October 24th: "L'Humanité" published a communiqué from the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party. The communiqué stated: The Political Bureau met on October 23rd to discuss the situation arising from Marty's resolute refusal to conduct a sincere self-criticism of his serious political deviations and factional activities. These errors of Marty were unanimously condemned by the Central Committee on September 4th, and Marty himself had admitted them more than once.

The Political Bureau studied Marty's self-criticism and believed that not only did he fail to strictly and sincerely criticize his own errors, the roots and consequences of these errors, but he also attempted to defend his political errors and factional activities. This self-criticism can only be regarded as an attempt to draft an anti-Party program, because it distorts the Party's policies, undermines the Party's doctrines and principles, and tramples on the most obvious truths. At a time when the government is launching an offensive, actions that endanger the Party's unity have occurred. Therefore, the Political Bureau unanimously decided to temporarily remove Marty from his position as a member of the Political Bureau, pending a final decision by the next plenary session of the Central Committee.

At the same time, the Political Bureau believes that Dejean's statement is clearly unsatisfactory and does not meet the minimum requirements. The Political Bureau demands that Dejean conduct a sincere self-criticism, and the Party has the right to expect him to do so.

    法共政治局发表公报
    撤销马尔梯政治局委员的职务要求狄戎进行真诚的自我检讨
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十四日讯：“人道报”刊载了法国共产党中央委员会政治局的公报。公报说：政治局在十月二十三日集会，讨论了由于马尔梯坚决拒绝对他的严重政治偏向和派系活动进行真诚的自我批评而引起的情况。马尔梯的这些错误，在九月四日曾被中央委员会一致谴责，而马尔梯本人也曾经不止一次地承认过。
    政治局研究了马尔梯的检讨书，认为他不但没有严格和真诚地批判自己的错误以及错误的根源和后果，反而企图替自己的政治错误和派系活动辩护。这份检讨书只能被认为企图拟订一种反党的纲领，因为它歪曲了党的政策，破坏了党的学说和原则，蹂躏了最明显的真理。正当政府展开进攻的时候，竟发生了这一类危害党的统一的行动。因此，政治局一致决定暂时撤销马尔梯政治局委员之职，留待下届中央委员会全体会议作最后决定。
    政治局同时认为狄戎的声明显然不能令人满意，并且不符合最低的要求。政治局要求狄戎进行真诚的自我检讨，党有权利期待他这样做。
