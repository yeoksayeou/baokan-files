    Mao Qibao Mutual Aid Group Helps Military Families with Harvesting
    Editor: Ling Yanglingyu, a poor peasant military family member in the Eighth Village, Xidu Township, First District, Hengyang County, Hunan Province, was allocated six mu and four fen of land during the land reform. Thanks to the active cultivation by the village farmers and the government's fertilizer loan assistance, the rice grew very well this year. However, when it came time to harvest, it suddenly rained heavily for ten consecutive days. The village farmers mobilized to rush the harvest, but they didn't have time to help Ling Yanglingyu harvest the rice. It looked like the rice in the fields was about to sprout.
    The Mao Qibao Mutual Aid Group in the Sixth Village of the same township, after learning about this, immediately organized five members, led by Mao Qibao, to go to the Eighth Village to help the military family rush the harvest. With the efforts of Mao Qibao and others, Ling Yanglingyu's more than six mu of rice were harvested in just two days, and they also carefully selected rice seeds for Ling Yanglingyu. When rushing the harvest, Mao Qibao and others not only declined wages but also repeatedly urged the host not to waste food. Ling Yanglingyu was very moved. She said in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, "Chairman Mao, the mutual aid group you lead is so good. I will tell my son not to worry about the family and to work hard to learn skills and kill more enemies!" Her rice production this year has increased by five dan compared to last year.
    The spirit of the Mao Qibao Mutual Aid Group in actively helping military families is commendable.

    毛启宝互助组帮助军属收割
    编辑同志：湖南省衡阳县第一区西渡乡八村贫农军属凌杨灵玉在土地改革中分到的六亩四分田，因为本村农民的积极代耕和政府肥料贷款的帮助，今年稻谷一直长得很好。可是当收割的时候，忽然一连下了十天大雨，村里的农民都动员起来抢收，没来得及帮助凌杨灵玉割稻，眼看田里的稻谷就要生芽了。
    同乡六村毛启宝互助组知道这事以后，就马上组织了五个组员由毛启宝带领到八村帮助军属抢收。在毛启宝等的努力下，只两天的功夫就把凌杨灵玉的六亩多稻谷割完了，并且还为凌杨灵玉仔细地挑选了稻种。在抢收时，毛启宝等不但谢绝了工资，还再三叮嘱主人在饭食方面不要浪费。凌杨灵玉很受感动，她在毛主席像前说：“毛主席，你领导的互助组太好了，我要告诉我的儿子不要挂念家里，要努力学习本领，多杀敌人！”她今年比去年增产稻谷五挑。
    毛启宝互助组这种积极帮助军属的精神是值得表扬的。
