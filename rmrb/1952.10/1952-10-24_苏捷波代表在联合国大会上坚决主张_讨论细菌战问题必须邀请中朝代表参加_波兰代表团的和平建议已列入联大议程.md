Xinhua News Agency, 23rd New York Dispatch: The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the 21st to discuss the General Assembly's agenda. Subsequently, the United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the same day to discuss the General Committee's recommendations regarding the agenda.

The General Assembly plenary meeting adopted the General Committee's recommendation to include the Polish delegation's proposal on eliminating the threat of another world war and strengthening international peace and friendly cooperation on the Assembly's agenda.

Another issue discussed by the General Committee and the General Assembly plenary meeting was the United States' request to include the so-called "investigation" of the facts of the United States army's use of bacteriological weapons in Korea on the Assembly's agenda.

At the General Committee meeting, Soviet representative Gromyko declared that if the General Committee recommended inviting representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion, the Soviet delegation would agree to include this issue on the agenda. If the committee took a different attitude on this issue, the Soviet delegation would have to vote against including this issue on the agenda. However, the United States representative tried hard to prevent the discussion of the Soviet proposal in the committee. Ignoring the opposition of the Soviet and Czechoslovak representatives, the committee passed a recommendation to the plenary meeting to include the issue raised by the United States on the agenda. Gromyko opposed this cowardly attitude of the United States, pointing out that it showed that the United States was afraid of hearing the opinions of the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China on the issue raised by the United States government itself. This made it impossible not to conclude that the purpose of the United States in raising this issue was merely to divert the Assembly's attention from the important issues raised by Poland (such as ending the Korean War, the North Atlantic Alliance, and reducing armaments by one-third, etc.).

At the General Assembly plenary meeting discussing the inclusion of the issue raised by the United States on the Assembly's agenda, Soviet representative Gromyko reiterated that the Soviet delegation's attitude remained the same as when this issue was discussed in the General Committee, and did not oppose including this issue on the Assembly's agenda, but the Assembly must simultaneously decide to invite representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of this issue.

Gromyko said that the United States representatives were afraid of letting representatives from China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea participate in the discussion of the issue of the United States armed forces' use of bacteriological weapons. They did not want the Assembly to know the true situation in this regard.

Gromyko said that the United States government was afraid of a fair investigation, and therefore stubbornly insisted on an investigation by the so-called International Committee of the Red Cross. Everyone knows that the Americans suggested entrusting the "investigation" of the United States army's use of bacteriological weapons to this committee, which is completely a submissive tool of the United States State Department, ready to carry out any task at the command of its master, provide any investigation results, and cover up any crimes. The International Committee of the Red Cross has covered up the crimes of the Hitlerite elements in the past, and now it is covering up the criminal activities of the American interventionists in Korea.

Gromyko said that the Soviet delegation believed that it was necessary to submit the following proposal to the General Assembly plenary meeting: "The General Assembly decides to include the issue raised by the delegation of the United States of America on the agenda of the Seventh General Assembly, and at the same time decides to invite representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion of this issue."

The Czechoslovak representative pointed out that the United States delegation was attempting to prevent the discussion of the issue of the United States army's use of bacteriological weapons in Korea. It was precisely for this reason that the United States representative opposed allowing the governments whose territories had been ravaged by this crime and who had accused the United States army of using criminal bacteriological weapons to express their opinions on this issue. Therefore, the Czechoslovak delegation warmly supported the Soviet proposal.

Polish Foreign Minister Skrzeszewski also spoke in support of the Soviet proposal, emphasizing that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the government of the People's Republic of China had both condemned the United States for conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea. This condemnation has been confirmed by authoritative international investigation groups, including investigation groups composed of scientists from different countries. The Polish representative said that it would be absolutely impermissible to only allow the defendant to attend the discussion without allowing the main plaintiffs to participate when the Assembly discusses this issue. Rejecting such a fair proposal from the Soviet Union would clearly show that the United States ruling circles only wanted to desperately divert public attention from the criminal actions of the United States army in Korea.

The representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom claimed that the decision regarding the Soviet proposal should be made by the Political Committee. They attempted to avoid voting on the Soviet proposal in this way. Thus, the representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom tried everything possible to prove that the Soviet proposal was a "procedural" issue.

However, the Soviet, Czechoslovak, and Polish delegations successively exposed this clumsy tactic of the United States and the United Kingdom, and the attempt of the United States and the United Kingdom bloc to avoid voting on the Soviet proposal finally failed. The President of the Assembly had to put the Soviet delegation's proposal to a vote. The representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, and Ukraine voted in favor of the Soviet proposal. The representatives of Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Yemen, Argentina, and Burma abstained. The delegations of Afghanistan and Pakistan did not participate in the vote. The representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom aggression bloc voted against the Soviet proposal.

The open opposition of the representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom bloc to inviting representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of the issue of the United States army's use of bacteriological weapons in Korea showed that they were afraid of a fair investigation into the atrocities of the United States interventionist army.

[This Newspaper News] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Second (Economic and Financial), Third (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural), Fourth (Trusteeship), Fifth (Administrative and Budgetary), and Sixth (Legal) Committees of the United Nations General Assembly began work on October 20th.

The committees adopted the agenda and elected vice-chairmen and rapporteurs.

According to the suggestions of representatives from the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Belarus, Polish representative Professor Lachs was elected as the vice-chairman of the Sixth Committee.

### 苏捷波代表在联合国大会上坚决主张  讨论细菌战问题必须邀请中朝代表参加  波兰代表团的和平建议已列入联大议程

    苏捷波代表在联合国大会上坚决主张
    讨论细菌战问题必须邀请中朝代表参加
    波兰代表团的和平建议已列入联大议程
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会总务委员会于二十一日举行会议讨论大会议程问题，接着，联合国大会全体会议在同日举行会议，讨论总务委员会关于议程的建议。
    大会全体会议通过总务委员会的建议，决定把波兰代表团提出的关于消除另一次世界大战威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作的建议列入大会议程。
    总务委员会及大会全体会议讨论的另一个问题是：美国要求把所谓“调查”美国军队在朝鲜使用细菌武器的事实的问题列入大会议程。
    在总务委员会会议上，苏联代表葛罗米柯即宣称，如果总务委员会建议邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国代表参加讨论，苏联代表团就同意把这一问题列入议程。如果委员会在这个问题上采取另一种态度的话，苏联代表团就不得不投票反对把这一问题列入议程。然而，美国代表在委员会中竭力阻止讨论苏联的建议。委员会不顾苏联和捷克斯洛伐克代表的反对，就通过向全体会议建议把美国所提出的问题列入议程。葛罗米柯反对美国的这种卑怯态度，他指出，这表示美国害怕听取朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的代表在美国政府自己提出的问题上表示意见。这就让人不能不得出这样一个结论：美国提出这一问题的目的，仅仅是想转移大会对于波兰所提出的重要问题（如结束朝鲜战争、北大西洋联盟以及裁减军备三分之一等等问题）的注意。
    在大会全体会议讨论美国所提出的问题列入大会议程时，苏联代表葛罗米柯再度指出，苏联代表团的态度仍然像这问题在总务委员会讨论时一样，并不反对把这问题列入大会议程，但是必须大会同时决定邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的代表参加这一问题的讨论。
    葛罗米柯说，美国代表害怕让中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加关于美国武装部队使用细菌武器问题的讨论。他们不愿让大会知道这方面的真实情况。
    葛罗米柯说，美国政府害怕公正的调查，因此固执地主张由所谓红十字国际委员会进行调查。大家都知道，美国人建议把“调查”美国军队使用细菌武器的工作委托给这个委员会，而这个委员会完全是美国国务院的顺从工具，随时准备奉主子的命令执行任何任务，供给任何调查结果，掩盖任何罪行。红十字国际委员会过去曾掩盖希特勒分子的罪行，现在它又在掩盖美国干涉者在朝鲜的罪恶活动。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联代表团认为必须向大会全体会议提出下述提案：“大会决定，把美利坚合众国代表团提出的问题列入第七届大会的议程，同时并决定邀请中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加这一问题的讨论。”
    捷克斯洛伐克代表指出：美国代表团企图阻止讨论美军在朝鲜使用细菌武器的问题。正是由于这个缘故，美国代表才反对让那些国土受到这种罪行的蹂躏，并向联合国控诉美军使用罪恶的细菌武器的政府在这个问题上发表它们的意见。因此，捷克斯洛伐克代表团热烈支持苏联的提案。
    波兰外交部长斯克列杰夫斯基也发言支持苏联的提案，他着重指出：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府都提出了美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的谴责。这种谴责已获得权威的国际调查团体的证实，其中包括不同国家的科学家所组成的调查团体。波兰代表说：如果在大会讨论这个问题的时候，只让被告出席而不让主要原告参加讨论，那是绝不能容许的。拒绝苏联这样一个公正的提案将清楚地表明：美国统治集团只想拚命转移公众对于美军在朝鲜的罪恶行动的注意。
    美、英两国代表声称：关于苏联提案的决定应由政治委员会作出。他们企图这样来避免表决苏联提出的提案。于是美英两国代表就千方百计地证明苏联提案是一种“程序”问题。
    然而苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰代表团相继揭露美英两国代表这种笨拙的手法，结果美英集团想要避免表决苏联提案的企图终于失败。大会主席不得不把苏联代表团的提案付诸表决。苏联、波兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克和乌克兰代表投票赞成苏联提案。埃及、印度、印尼、伊朗、也门、阿根廷和缅甸代表弃权。阿富汗和巴基斯坦代表团未参加投票。美英侵略集团代表投票反对苏联提案。
    美英集团代表公开反对邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国代表参加美军在朝鲜使用细菌武器问题的讨论，这就表明了他们害怕对美国干涉军的暴行进行公正调查。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：联合国大会的第二（经济与财政）、第三（社会、人道与文化）、第四（托管）、第五（行政与预算）和第六（法律）委员会于十月二十日开始工作。
    各委员会通过了议程，并选出了副主席和报告员。
    根据苏联、乌克兰、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和白俄罗斯代表的建议，波兰代表拉赫斯教授当选为第六委员会的副主席。
