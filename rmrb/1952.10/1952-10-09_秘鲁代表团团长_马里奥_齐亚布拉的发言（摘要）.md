Chairman, fellow delegates:

We, the Peruvian representatives, overcame numerous obstacles from the reactionary military junta to have the honor of attending this historic conference in the capital of New China. We have many reasons to consider this an important honor, one of which is that, for Peru, this is the first time it has been able to send representatives to such an extremely important conference, where people, with lofty aspirations, are building an impregnable fortress against war.

Our delegation is here to express that the Peruvian people wholeheartedly support this sacred peace movement, which is cherished and supported by the hearts of all sincere human beings. Our delegation assures that it will stand with the fraternal people of all countries, actively undertake the responsibility of striving for peace, because peace is the aspiration that inspires human justice.

To achieve international peace and welfare, just as to achieve domestic peace and welfare, constant vigilance, constant cooperation, and organized efforts must be maintained. And just as domestic peace and welfare are obtained, international peace and welfare can only be achieved through dynamic and developing organizations. That is why all the people of Peru firmly support the many proposals of the world peace movement.

Before I conclude my speech, I would like to express our people's warm respect to the People's Republic of China, to the Soviet Union, to the heroic and magnificently sacrificing Korea, and to the European People's Democratic countries, thanking them for their significant contributions to the great cause of world peace. We would also like to pay tribute, through you delegates, to all the countries that, regardless of all dangers, finally managed to attend this historic conference.

Let us win peace together! (Xinhua News Agency)

    秘鲁代表团团长
    马里奥·齐亚布拉的发言（摘要）主席、各位代表：
    我们秘鲁代表克服了反动军阀政权的重重阻难，才有幸得以到新中国的首都来参加这次历史性的会议。我们有许多理由把这件事看作一个重要的光荣，其中一个理由就是：对于秘鲁说来，这还是第一次能够派遣代表参加这样一个极端重要的会议，在这个会议上，人们抱着崇高的决心，正在建立起一个牢不可破的反对战争的堡垒。
    我们代表团在这里表示，秘鲁人民全心全意拥护这神圣的和平运动，这个运动是所有真诚人类的心灵都爱护和支持的。我们代表团保证：它将与各国兄弟人民在一起，积极地负起争取和平的责任，因为和平是鼓舞人类的正义的愿望的。
    要达到国际和平与福利正和要达到国内的和平与福利一样，必须保持经常的警惕、经常的合作和有组织的努力。也正如获得国内的和平与福利一样，国际和平与福利惟有通过有活力和能发展的组织机构才能获得。这就是为什么，我们秘鲁的全体人民，坚决支持世界和平运动的许多提议。
    在我结束讲话以前，我愿向中华人民共和国、向苏联、向英勇的、蒙受壮烈牺牲的朝鲜并向欧洲人民民主国家表示我国人民对它们的热烈的敬意，感谢他们对世界和平的伟大事业作出了重大的贡献。我们还要通过各位代表，向所有不顾一切危险、终于设法来参加这次历史性会议的国家致敬。
    让我们一起赢得和平！（新华社）
