Xinhua News Agency, October 14th dispatch from Paris: Under the direction of the United States, the French Binet government has recently orchestrated a new conspiracy to persecute the French working class, its vanguard the French Communist Party, and French democratic organizations. On October 10th, the Paris military tribunal falsely accused Alain Le Léap, General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and Vice-President of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), of "undermining morale and discouraging spirit" for defending peace and opposing the massacre of the Vietnamese people, and imprisoned him in the Fresnes prison near Paris. In the two days preceding Léripe's imprisonment, the offices of many democratic organizations such as the French Communist Party and the French Republican Youth League in Paris, Marseille, Rouen, Bordeaux, and many other large cities, as well as the "l'Humanité" and "Ce Soir" newspaper offices, were searched. Monier, member of the Seine Provincial Committee of the French Communist Party and commentator for "Avant-Garde," and Laurent, Guédou, and Beaudot, secretaries of the French Republican Youth League, were arrested and imprisoned. The Paris military tribunal also issued arrest warrants on the same charges for Soguier, former Senator, member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and secretary of the Communist Party's Seine Provincial Committee, as well as Zilli, secretary of the French Republican Youth League, and Maissat, member of the league's National Committee Executive Bureau.

The Binet government's persecution was premeditated and is a continuation of the fascist conspiracy to frame the French Communist Party and democratic organizations in May and June of this year. After the start of this new persecution, a dispatch from Agence France-Presse (AFP) from Paris quoted the French bourgeois newspaper "Le Monde" as saying: "The government has long intended to carry out large-scale arrests of communist activists and members of other democratic organizations in Paris and various provinces." The Binet government's new anti-people fascist actions reflect its own serious difficulties. Facing a deepening economic and political crisis, the Binet government vainly attempts to rely on fascist means to intimidate the people and weaken the people's powerful struggle to defend peace and oppose war and treasonous policies, in order to maintain its shaky rule.

However, the Binet government's atrocities have only aroused even higher fighting spirit among the French people. On the 11th, the French General Confederation of Labour (CGT) called on all French workers to rise up against this fascist persecution. Workers and staff of many factories in Saint-Denis, Montreuil, Nice, Rouen, and other cities across the country responded to the CGT's call and held short protest strikes. Many workers who participate in the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC) and the "Workers' Force" (Force Ouvrière) trade union organization of the Socialist Party fought alongside their worker brothers from the CGT. In Paris, railway workers at the Saint-Lazare station, who belong to both the CGT and the CFTC, jointly wrote a letter to Binet demanding the immediate release of Léripe; many shop assistants who belong to the CFTC and "Workers' Force" also demanded an end to the persecution of Léripe. The Lower Seine Provincial Union Federation of the CFTC passed a resolution protesting "any persecution and searches aimed at stifling the trade union movement." The French National Peace Council also decided on the 12th to write an open letter to Michel, the investigating judge of the Paris military tribunal, demanding the immediate release of Léripe and other peace fighters.

Xinhua News Agency, October 14th dispatch from Vienna via TASS on the 13th: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) telegraphed French Prime Minister Binet, protesting the illegal arrest of Alain Léripe, Vice-President of the WFTU and General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labour (CGT). The telegram stated: The news of the illegal arrest of Léripe has aroused the indignation and hatred of working people around the world. Working people of all countries believe that arresting the General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labour at a time when the French working class is fighting for freedom, peace, and against poverty is a provocative act. The WFTU expresses the will of working people around the world and firmly protests this fascist measure that destroys trade union freedom and freedom of speech. The WFTU, representing its 80 million members, demands the immediate release of its Vice-President and an end to the suppression of the trade union movement. The WFTU also demands an end to colonial wars and policies that create war and poverty.

The WFTU also called on the member states of the United Nations to intervene and force the French government to immediately release Léripe.

Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) sent a telegram to French Prime Minister Binet lodging a serious protest regarding the French government's unreasonable detention of Alain Léripe, General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and Vice-President of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). The telegram stated: "Alain Léripe, Vice-President of the WFTU and General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labour, has been unreasonably imprisoned by the French government for engaging in just actions supporting the defense of world peace and opposing the French government's dirty colonial war in Vietnam. We, representing all Chinese workers and working people, lodge a serious protest against this act of blatant violation of democratic rights by the French government, and demand the immediate and unconditional restoration of Léripe's freedom."

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions also sent a telegram to the French General Confederation of Labour (CGT), expressing firm support for the heroic struggle of the French working class to achieve lasting peace and end the war of aggression against Vietnam, and expressed confidence that the final victory will surely belong to the French working class and working people.

    比内政府迫害法国工人阶级逮捕勒里普等
    世界工联和我全国总工会提出严重抗议
    【新华社十四日讯】巴黎消息：在美国指示下，法国比内政府最近又策动了一个迫害法国工人阶级、它的先锋队法国共产党以及法国民主组织的新阴谋。十月十日，巴黎军事法庭诬陷保卫和平、反对屠杀越南人民的法国总工会总书记、世界工会联合会副主席勒里普犯了“败坏民心，沮丧士气”罪，而把他投入巴黎近郊的费雷纳监狱里。在勒里普入狱的前两天中，法国共产党和法兰西共和青年联盟等许多民主组织在巴黎和马赛、卢昂、波尔多、及其他许多大城市的办公处以及“人道报”和“今晚报”报馆，都被搜查，法国共产党塞纳省委员会委员、“前卫报”评论家莫尼埃，法兰西共和青年联盟书记劳伦、盖杜科朗、贝娄脱等，都被捕入狱。巴黎军事法庭并且以同样的罪名发出拘票，要拘捕前参议院议员、法国共产党中央委员会委员、共产党塞纳省委员会书记苏吉埃尔，法兰西共和青年联盟书记齐利及联盟的全国委员会执行局委员麦塞等人。
    比内政府的迫害行动是蓄谋已久的，它是今年五六月间陷害法国共产党和民主组织的法西斯阴谋之继续。在这次新的迫害开始后，法新社从巴黎发出的一条电讯引法国资产阶级报纸“世界报”消息说：“政府早就打算要在巴黎和各省大举逮捕共产党积极分子及其他民主组织的成员。”比内政府的新的反人民的法西斯行动反映出它本身的严重困难。面临着日益深重的经济危机和政治危机的比内政府，妄想依靠法西斯手段来恫吓人民，削弱人民保卫和平反对战争与卖国政策的强有力的斗争，以维持它的动摇不稳的统治。
    但是，比内政府的暴行只激起了法国人民更加高涨的斗争情绪。法国总工会在十一日号召法国全体工人起来反抗这种法西斯迫害。圣但尼、蒙特勒伊、尼斯、卢昂和全国其他各城市许多工厂的职工们响应总工会的号召，举行了短时期的抗议罢工。参加天主教劳工联盟和社会党工会组织“工人力量”的许多劳动者都和法国总工会的工人兄弟们并肩斗争。在巴黎，参加总工会和参加天主教劳工联盟的圣·拉萨车站铁路职工联名写信给比内，要求立即释放勒里普；参加天主教劳工联盟和“工人力量”的许多店员也要求停止迫害勒里普。天主教劳工联盟下塞纳省工会联合会通过决议，抗议“阴谋扼杀工会运动的任何迫害和搜查”。法国全国和平理事会也已经在十二日决定写公开信给巴黎军事法庭侦察庭法官米歇尔，要求立即释放勒里普及其他和平战士。
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十三日讯：世界工会联合会书记处打电报给法国总理比内，抗议非法逮捕世界工会联合会副主席、法国总工会总书记勒里普。电文说：非法逮捕勒里普的消息激起了全世界劳动人民的愤慨和憎恨。各国劳动人民认为：在法国工人阶级正在进行争取自由和平、反对贫穷的斗争的时候，逮捕法国总工会总书记是一种挑衅行为。世界工会联合会表示全世界劳动人民的意志，坚决抗议这种摧残工会自由与言论自由的法西斯措施。世界工会联合会代表它的八千万会员，要求立即释放它的副主席，停止镇压工会运动。世界工会联合会还要求结束殖民战争和制造战争与贫穷的政策。
    世界工会联合会同时要求联合国各会员国出面干涉，迫使法国政府立即释放勒里普。
    【新华社十四日讯】中华全国总工会就法国政府无理拘禁法国总工会总书记、世界工联副主席勒里普一事致电法国政府总理比内，提出严重抗议。电文说：“世界工联副主席及法国总工会总书记勒里普，因从事支持保卫世界和平及反对法国政府在越南进行的肮脏的殖民战争的正义行动、被法国政府无理监禁。我们代表中国全体工人与劳动人民，对法国政府这种悍然破坏民主权利的行为，提出严重抗议，并要求立刻无条件地恢复勒里普的自由。”
    中华全国总工会同时致电法国总工会，表示坚决支持法国工人阶级为争取持久和平与结束侵略越南的战争而进行的英勇斗争，并确信最后胜利一定属于法国工人阶级与劳动人民。
