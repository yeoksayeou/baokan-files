    Strive for International Peace, Oppose Warmongers!
    — Excerpts from the "Pravda" Editorial of October 19th, Soviet Union

    The working people of all countries and all progressive humanity warmly welcome the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the historic speech of the great leader Stalin, and his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." Millions of people fighting for freedom, democracy, and peace welcome these documents, considering them yet another manifestation of the Soviet people's will to fight for the victory of communism, their firm determination to crush the plans of the instigators of new wars, and to safeguard the cause of peace. The working people of all countries rightly believe that the powerful Soviet Union is a solid and reliable fortress of freedom and world peace, and the "shock brigade" of the world's revolutionary workers' movement.

    From its very first days, the Soviet socialist state declared the Leninist-Stalinist policy of international peace and friendship and has steadfastly pursued this policy.

    For many years, the Soviet Union, despite the difficult circumstances of being surrounded by capitalism, bravely exposed the aggressive plans of war-makers and resolutely fought for peace and international security.

    It was due to the heroic struggle of the Soviet people that World War II ended in a way that the instigators of imperialist wars had not anticipated.

    The Soviet state is no longer an isolated island surrounded by capitalist countries. One-third of humanity has freed itself from imperialist oppression and is building a new life under the banner of democracy and socialism.

    In the post-war period, two camps have formed on the international stage. The peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union, is constantly growing in strength and is fighting to maintain and consolidate peace.

    In contrast to the democratic camp, the imperialist camp, led by the United States, is pursuing a policy of aggression and launching another war. In preparation for another war aimed at establishing the world hegemony of American imperialism, the American ruling clique has established the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is reviving German and Japanese militarism and fascism, launched a bloody war of intervention in Korea, is doing its utmost to deceive the people of all countries with lies, and is distorting the genuinely peace-loving policies of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

    In an atmosphere of escalating threats of another war, the Soviet Union is resolutely fighting to maintain and consolidate peace, tirelessly exposing and thwarting the conspiracies of the imperialists. In foreign policy, in the struggle for peace, the basis of all Soviet activities has always been that peaceful coexistence and cooperation between capitalism and communism are entirely possible if there is a willingness to cooperate with each other, a willingness to fulfill the obligations undertaken, and if the principles of equal rights and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed.

    In his report to the 19th Party Congress on behalf of the Central Committee, Malenkov said that the party's basic policy in foreign affairs has always been, and still is, a policy of international peace and ensuring the security of our socialist motherland.

    The Soviet Union's Stalinist policy of peace has always enjoyed the sympathy and support of the masses of people around the world, because this policy not only conforms to the interests of the Soviet people, but also to the most vital interests and aspirations of all progressive humanity.

    In the struggle for peace and against the instigators of new wars, the democratic camp has received the active support of hundreds of millions of ordinary people in all countries who desire peace. The worldwide democratic peace movement is growing stronger day by day. Preparations are actively underway for the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna in December.

    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference recently held in Beijing is extremely important for further developing the peace movement in Asia and around the world. This conference demonstrates the great strength of the national consciousness of the Asian countries that are awakening in the struggle against imperialism, and the strength of their determination to defend peace in the Far East and the world and to oppose American imperialist aggression.

    The forces of peace and democracy are growing stronger. The current balance of power between the imperialist war camp and the peace and democracy camp makes maintaining peace and avoiding a new war a very real prospect.

    The task now is to further intensify the activities of the masses, strengthen the organization of peace advocates, tirelessly expose the warmongers, and prevent them from deceiving the people of all countries with lies. To contain and isolate the adventurers in the imperialist aggressor camp who, in order to make profits, are trying to drag the people of all countries into a massacre. This is the main task of all progressive and peace-loving humanity.

    The strength of the Soviet Union is flourishing, and it is going from one victory to another. No force in the world can stop the development of Soviet society. Our cause is invincible. The Soviet state is moving forward with confidence that will not be weakened by provocation or intimidation. The great leader and teacher Stalin is leading the march towards the victory of communism.

    争取国际和平、反对战争贩子！
    ——苏联“真理报”十月十九日社论摘要
    世界各国的劳动人民和所有的进步人类都热诚欢迎苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的决议、伟大的领袖斯大林的历史性演说和他的光辉著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。正在为自由、民主与和平而战斗的千百万人民都欢迎这些文件，认为它们又一次表现了苏联人民为共产主义的胜利而斗争的意志和他们要粉碎新战争挑拨者的计划及维护和平事业的坚定决心。世界各国的劳动人民公正地认为，强大的苏联是自由与世界和平的坚固可靠的堡垒，是世界革命工人运动的“突击队”。
    苏维埃社会主义国家自从成立的最初几天起就宣布了列宁—斯大林的国际和平友好政策，并一直坚定不移地奉行着这个政策。
    在许多年中，苏联是不顾资本主义包围的困难处境，勇敢地揭露战争制造者的侵略计划，坚决地为和平与国际安全而斗争的唯一国家。
    由于苏联人民的英勇斗争，第二次世界大战才以帝国主义战争挑拨者未曾预料到的方式结束了。
    苏维埃国家再不是一个被资本主义国家包围的孤岛了。三分之一的人类已经摆脱了帝国主义压迫，并且正在民主和社会主义的旗帜下建设新的生活。
    在战后时期中，国际舞台上形成了两个阵营。以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的实力正在不断地增长壮大，正在为维护及巩固和平而进行斗争。
    与民主阵营相反，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营正在奉行侵略和发动另一次战争的政策。为了准备以建立美帝国主义的世界霸权为目的的另一次战争，美国统治集团成立了侵略性的北大西洋集团，正在复活德国和日本的军国主义和法西斯主义，在朝鲜发动了血腥的干涉战争，极力用谎言来蒙蔽各国人民，并歪曲苏联和人民民主国家的真正爱好和平的政策。
    在另一次战争的威胁加剧的气氛中，苏联正在坚决地为维护与巩固和平而战斗，正在不倦地揭露并粉碎帝国主义者的阴谋。在外交政策方面，在争取和平的斗争中，苏联一切活动的根据始终是，如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，并且平等权利与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那末资本主义与共产主义的和平共存与合作就是十分可能的。
    马林科夫在第十九次党代表大会上代表中央委员会所作的报告中说，党在外交政策方面的基本方针一向是，现在也还是国际和平与确保我们社会主义祖国的安全的政策。
    苏联的斯大林和平外交政策过去和现在始终得到全世界人民群众的同情和支持，因为这种政策不仅符合于苏联人民的利益，而且符合于所有进步人类的最切身的利益和愿望。
    在争取和平，反对新战争挑拨者的斗争中，民主阵营得到了世界各国希望和平的数亿普通人民的积极支持。全世界的民主和平运动正在日益壮大。目前正在积极进行将于十二月在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会的筹备工作。
    最近在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，对于进一步展开亚洲和全世界的和平运动是极其重要的。这次会议说明正在反对帝国主义的斗争中觉醒起来的亚洲各国人民的民族自觉有着多么伟大的力量，说明他们保卫远东和世界和平，反对美帝国主义侵略的决心是如何坚强。
    和平和民主力量正在增长壮大。帝国主义战争阵营和和平民主阵营目前力量的对比，使维护和平和避免新战争变成了一个十分现实的前景。
    现在的任务是进一步加紧人民群众的活动，加强和平拥护者的组织，不倦地揭露战争贩子，不让他们用谎言来蒙蔽各国人民。遏止并孤立帝国主义侵略者阵营中的冒险分子，他们为了谋取利润，正在试图把各国人民卷入一次大屠杀。以上就是整个进步与爱好和平的人类的主要任务。
    苏联的力量正在蓬勃发展，它正由一个胜利走向另一个胜利。世界上没有什么力量可以阻止苏维埃社会的发展。我们的事业是不可战胜的。苏维埃国家正怀着不会被挑衅和恐吓所削弱的信心向前迈进。伟大的领袖和导师斯大林领导着向共产主义的胜利前进。　　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯）
