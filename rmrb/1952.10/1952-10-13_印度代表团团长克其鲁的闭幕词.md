Mr. Chairman, Honorable Gentlemen, Dear Friends, Delegates from various countries in Asia and the Pacific region:

Our work is coming to an end. Now we can look back on the past eleven days and at the same time assess the achievements we have made. We, the warriors for peace, are clear-headed people. Although we are full of enthusiasm, we do not overestimate our achievements. Now, as we are about to evaluate the results of our deliberations during the conference, let us continue to maintain a clear head.

Looking back on those past days, think of those discussions—often seemingly endless discussions; those arguments—sometimes not very peaceful; think of the exchange and divergence of opinions on every possible issue by people with very different views; the repeated drafting of resolutions, statements, declarations, and appeals—again and again and again…

Think of all this, and then, based on this situation, look at the amazing consensus of opinion we have shown today on every resolution.

On any other forum in the world, could such an agreement and mutual understanding be reached? I say no. Only the peace movement can accomplish such a miracle. Only the peace movement can inspire each of us with this spirit of friendship and cooperation that permeates the entire conference.

Only the peace movement writes on its banner: we seek and emphasize those issues and words that promote unity, and avoid those that create division.

Glory to the peace movement, the driving force behind the great unity of the people of the world.

However, there is another important factor in this conference held in Beijing, which, in my opinion, is of utmost significance to the progress of our discussions. This factor is the overall attitude of the Chinese delegation and staff in helping all of us reach an agreement with their great efforts. Whenever international tensions reached a dangerous level and peace had to be forced to be realized, our Chinese friends stepped forward, bringing hot Chinese tea, many Chinese cookies and fruits, and of course, the rich special wisdom and open-mindedness they had used to liberate their great motherland, to rescue peace.

I think I am representing the views of you all when I say that if our conference had not been held in this great fortress of freedom and peace—the city of Beijing—if it had not been for the constant and kind care of our outstanding Chinese delegation headed by Mr. Soong Ching Ling, Mr. Guo Moruo, Mayor Peng Zhen, and our dear Secretary-General Liu Ningyi, our conference would never have been able to proceed so smoothly and effectively.

Now let me ask you all if you agree with me to make this calm judgment of our discussions:

The Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference has achieved the greatest success, far greater than the achievements imagined by the most optimistic among us. I ask you to pay attention to our achievements:

First, we have had the largest possible peace demonstration in a regional scope. This peace demonstration was held at one of the most critical junctures in history and discussed issues of paramount importance to the future of the world.

No wonder those war makers have begun to spread lies and slanders against us. A Hong Kong newspaper recently reported that the chairman of this conference was Mr. Molotov. The manufacture of such loud and clamorous lies shows that the victory of our conference has alarmed the enemy.

We all know that through our joint efforts, we have contributed our strength to build a new and powerful defensive wall to protect that noblest lady—the goddess of peace, for we are all her believers.

Second, we have drafted a series of solemn and noble documents and resolutions that will play a powerful role in strengthening the peace movement in all countries in this region and will powerfully influence other people from all walks of life who are still outside our ranks, bringing them into our movement.

Third, we have formally and informally established friendly relations between individual countries and among several countries, which will have a decisive impact on the development of the international situation.

Here I only need to mention one achievement of this conference—an achievement that is very precious to me—and you will agree with my view: the individual contacts between the representatives of various countries in Beijing are of great significance. I am referring to the joint statement of the Indian and Pakistani delegations.

Finally, we have established a new liaison organization to continue the work that has already begun here, to help promote exchanges and contacts between countries in this region. I believe that this step can and will greatly expand and strengthen the peace movement in Asia and the Pacific region.

Dear friends, we can be proud—all of us can be proud—that we have had such great honor to attend this historic event—the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.

The understanding we have gained at this conference has armed us, and we must step up our efforts to strengthen our peace movement. Imperialist countries want to use the economic backwardness of most of our countries to force us to accept their war policies and expand their control over our resources. We must defeat this attempt, we must stop the wars that are taking place on our land. The noble task requires us to make resolute efforts.

We should immediately take concrete steps to implement the resolutions passed by this conference, and strengthen the ties between our countries by exchanging cultural delegations and promoting mutually beneficial trade.

Those who attempt to turn us into cannon fodder for their wars are spreading rumors. Let us prepare to fight back against their deceptive propaganda! Let us spread the message of true peace so that people are no longer deceived.

Let us return to our own countries with the mission of this conference and promote it as widely as possible. Let us strive for the support of leaders from all sectors of society and the broad masses of ordinary people for the conference's letter to the United Nations.

Let us go back with warm memories, remembering the love, kindness, and friendship that filled this conference. Let us go back, not forgetting the hard work of the hundreds of staff members of the conference. We will never forget these men and women staff members, because their efficient and tireless work is the true backbone of this conference.

Let us forever commemorate this great gathering representing half of humanity.

Long live the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.

### 印度代表团团长克其鲁的闭幕词

1952-10-13
第1版()
专栏：

    印度代表团团长克其鲁的闭幕词主席团各位可尊敬的先生们，亲爱的朋友们，来自亚洲及太平洋区域各国的各位代表们：
    我们的工作就要告一结束了。现在我们可以回顾一下过去的十一天，同时来估计一下我们所取得的成就。我们为和平而战斗的人，是头脑清醒的人，尽管我们热情洋溢，但我们不过高估计我们的成就。现在当我们要来对我们在会议期间所深思熟虑而得的成果做估价的时候，让我们继续保持头脑清醒。
    回顾一下过去的那几天。想一想那些讨论——往往几乎像是永远没有完的讨论，那些争论——有时可不是很平和的；想一想见解很不相同的人们在每一个可能的问题上意见的交换和分歧；那些决议、声明、宣言和呼吁书的反复的起草—一次，又一次，再一次……
    想一想这一切，然后根据这种情况，再来看今天我们在每一个决议上所表现的令人惊叹的意见一致的情形。
    在世界的任何其他一个讲坛上，也能够达成这样一种协议和相互谅解吗？我说不能。只有和平运动才能完成这样的奇迹。只有和平运动才能以这种弥漫着整个会议的光辉的友好与合作的精神来鼓舞我们每一个人。
    只有和平运动才在它的旗帜上写着：我们要寻求并强调那些促成团结的问题和辞句，避免那些制造分裂的问题和辞句。
    光荣归于和平运动，这世界人民大团结的动力。
    然而，这次在北京举行的会议上，还有另外一个重要的因素，这个因素据我看来，对于我们的讨论的进行具有极重大的意义。这个因素就是中国代表团与工作人员在他们以巨大的努力帮助我们大家达成协议时所表现的整个的态度。每当国际紧张情势达到了危险程度，必须迫使和平实现的时候，我们的中国朋友们就挺身出来，拿着热的中国名茶，很多中国饼干和水果，自然还有他们曾用以解放自己伟大祖国的丰富的特殊智慧与开阔的眼界，来抢救和平。
    我想，我这样的讲法是代表了你们大家的意思的，就是说，假如我们的会议不在这个自由与和平的伟大堡垒——北京城——举行的话；假如它没有以宋庆龄先生、郭沫若先生、彭真市长及我们亲爱的秘书长刘宁一先生为首的我们出色的中国代表团经常亲切关心的话，我们的会议绝不能进行得这样圆满和有效。
    现在让我来问问大家是否同意我来对我们的讨论，作这个冷静的判断：
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议已经获得了最大的成功，比我们之中最乐观的想像者所想像的成就还要大很多很多。我要求大家注意看一下我们的成就：
    首先，我们已经在一个区域范围内有了尽可能的最壮大的和平示威。这个和平示威是在历史上一个最紧要的关头举行的，并且讨论了对世界的前途无上重要的问题。
    无怪乎那些战争制造者已开始在对我们散布谎言和诽谤。一家香港报纸最近报道说这次会议的主席是莫洛托夫先生。制造这种大喊大叫的谎言，就表示了我们会议的胜利，已使敌人惊慌失措。
    我们全知道由于我们共同工作，我们已经贡献了我们的力量建筑起一道新的强大的防御之墙，来保护那位最高贵的女士——和平女神，因为我们都是她的信徒。
    第二，我们已经拟订了一系列庄严、高贵的文件和决议，它们对于加强这个区域内所有各国的和平运动将起有力的作用，并将有力地影响直到现在还停留在我们队伍以外的其他各界人士，使他们进到我们的运动中来。
    第三，我们在个别国家和若干国家之间正式与非正式地结成了友好的关系，这种关系对于国际情势的发展进程具有决定性的影响。
    在这里我只须提到本会议的一个成就——这个成就对我说来是非常珍贵的——你们就会同意我的见解：在北京的各国代表之间的个别接触是具有重大意义的。我指的是印度代表团和巴基斯坦代表团的联合声明。
    最后，我们已经建立了一个新的联络组织来继续已经在这里开始做的工作，来帮助增进这个区域各国间的交流与接触。我相信，这个步骤能够而且一定会大大地扩大和加强亚洲及太平洋区域的和平运动。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们可以自豪——我们所有的人可以自豪——我们有了这样大的光荣来出席这个历史性的盛会——亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    我们在这个会议上所得到的认识武装了我们，我们就必须加紧努力工作来加强我们的和平运动。帝国主义国家想要利用我们大多数国家经济上的落后，来强迫我们接受他们的战争政策，并扩大对于我们资源的控制。我们必须打败这种企图，我们必须制止在我们这块土地上正在进行的战争。崇高的任务须要我们作坚决的努力。
    我们应该立刻采取具体的步骤，来贯彻这次会议通过的决议，并互派文化访问团，促进互利的贸易，从而加强我们各国间的联系。
    那些企图把我们变为替他们作战的炮灰的人们，正在散布谣言，让我们准备打退他们的欺骗宣传！让我们把真正的和平的信息传播开去，使人民不再受骗。
    让我们带着这个会议的使命回到我们自己国内，尽可能作最广泛的宣传。让我们争取各国的社会各界领袖与广大的普通人民来支持这个会议的致联合国书。
    让我们回去的时候，带着温暖的回忆，记住充满这个会议的热爱、善意和友谊。让我们回去的时候，不要忘记会议的几百位工作人员不辞辛苦的工作。我们永远不会忘记这些男女工作人员，因为他们的有效率的、不懈的工作是这个会议的真正的骨干。
    让我们永远纪念这个代表半数人类的伟大集会。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议万岁。（附图片）
