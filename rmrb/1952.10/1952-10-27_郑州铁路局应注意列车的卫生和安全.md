    Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Should Pay Attention to the Hygiene and Safety of Trains
    To the Editor: The hygiene on the No. 105 ordinary passenger train of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, which departed from Beijing to Xi'an on August 30th, was very poor. The floor of this passenger car was very dirty, and there were many flies in the dining car. Furthermore, on the No. 255 ordinary passenger train from Xi'an to Baoji on September 13th, the train attendants did not clean the car windows, and the glass was almost opaque; the dust on the seats was also very thick; the floor was covered with soil, and after sprinkling water, the entire floor was muddy. According to the train attendants, "There isn't a single mop in the entire car, and there is no hygiene system." The hygiene situation on the No. 244 ordinary passenger train from Baoji to Zhengzhou on September 16th was also not good. This passenger car had no side door, no wind shield, and no railings, making accidents very easy to happen.
    Therefore, I hope that the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau will conduct a comprehensive inspection of the hygiene and safety conditions of trains to correct the phenomena of neglecting hygiene work and neglecting safety. Ding Bo

    郑州铁路局应注意列车的卫生和安全
    编辑同志：八月三十日由北京开往西安的一○五次郑州铁路局的普通客车，卫生工作很差。这个客车的地面很脏，餐车内苍蝇很多。又九月十三日由西安开往宝鸡的二五五次普通客车的列车员，不擦洗车窗的玻璃，玻璃几乎不透明；座位上的灰尘也很厚；地板也被土遮盖了，洒水之后，满地是泥浆。据列车员说：“全车没有一个拖把，更没有卫生制度。”九月十六日，由宝鸡开往郑州的二四四次普通客车的卫生情况也不好。这辆客车没有侧门，没有风档，没有栏杆，很容易发生事故。
    因此，我希望郑州铁路局普遍检查一次列车的卫生和安全的情况，以纠正不重视卫生工作和不重视安全的现象。丁波
