    Madame Vaillant-Couturier Publishes Open Letter
    Condemning Mrs. Roosevelt for Denying the US Government's Germ Warfare Crimes

    Xinhua News Agency, October 21st: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation recently received an open letter from Madame Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, to Mrs. Roosevelt of the United States, dated September 5th, regarding the issue of germ warfare. This letter condemns Mrs. Roosevelt for denying the United States' germ warfare crimes.

    The open letter states that Mrs. Roosevelt and others, in the name of "American women," wrote a letter responding to the Women's International Democratic Federation's letter to American women in May of this year regarding the United States' germ warfare. In the letter, Mrs. Roosevelt and others repeated the denial statements of American newspapers, radio, and the United States government, attempting to conceal the truth about germ warfare.

    The open letter points out that while the US government denies conducting germ warfare, it boasts about manufacturing germ weapons. Captured American airmen admitted to dropping germ bombs in Korea. The US military requested more funds to expand biological warfare research at Camp Detrick in Maryland. A new germ warfare research laboratory has also been built on Long Island in New York. These facts have aroused increasing dissatisfaction among prominent Americans. Even Professor Theodor Rosebury, who directed the US military's germ warfare research institute during World War II, publicly opposed the US government's use of germ weapons in Korea.

    The open letter states that the people of the United States and the world demand that the US government ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol, but the US government has consistently refused. Faced with irrefutable accusations, the US government can only offer unacceptable suggestions to muddle through.

    The open letter rebukes the US government for attempting to use the International Committee of the Red Cross and the so-called World Health Organization, which once covered up the crimes of the German fascists, to conceal its germ warfare crimes.

    The open letter describes the struggle of the American people to demand an end to the atrocities in Korea, an end to the Korean War, and the return of their husbands and sons from Korea, and condemns Mrs. Roosevelt for not standing with the American people against the US military's terrorist acts in Korea.

    The open letter finally rebukes Mrs. Roosevelt, saying: "Your attitude shows that you are trying to conceal the truth, cover up the crimes of the US government in the Korean War, and have revealed yourself to women around the world as an accomplice to this inhumane crime. Women around the world judge you not by your words, but by your actions."

    瓦扬—古久里夫人发表公开信
    谴责罗斯福夫人抵赖美政府细菌战罪行
    【新华社二十一日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会最近收到国际民主妇女联合会总书记瓦扬—古久里夫人九月五日就细菌战问题给美国罗斯福夫人的一封公开信，这封信谴责罗斯福夫人抵赖美国进行细菌战的罪行。
    公开信说，罗斯福夫人等以“美国妇女”的名义写了一封信，答复国际民主妇女联合会在今年五月就美国进行细菌战问题给美国妇女的一封公开信。罗斯福夫人等在信里重复了美国的报纸、广播和美国政府的企图隐瞒细菌战真相的否认声明。
    公开信指出，美国政府一面否认进行细菌战，一面又吹嘘制造细菌武器。被俘的美国空军人员承认他们在朝鲜投掷细菌弹。美国军方要求拨更多的款项来扩大在美国马里兰州狄特里克营的生物战争研究工作。在纽约的长岛又新建了细菌战研究实验室。这些事实，已经引起日益增多的美国名流的不满，就是在第二次世界大战期间主持美军细菌战研究所的提奥多尔·罗兹伯里教授，也公开反对美国政府在朝鲜使用细菌武器。
    公开信说，美国和全世界人民都要求美国政府批准一九二五年的日内瓦议定书，但是美国政府始终拒绝。美国政府在证据确凿的指责面前，只能提出一些不能接受的建议来搪塞一番。
    公开信斥责美国政府企图利用曾经替德国法西斯掩饰罪行的红十字国际委员会和所谓世界卫生组织来掩饰进行细菌战的罪行。
    公开信叙述了美国人民为要求停止在朝鲜的暴行、结束朝鲜战争、让他们的丈夫、儿子从朝鲜回来而进行的斗争，并谴责罗斯福夫人没有和美国人民一起反对美军在朝鲜的恐怖行为。
    公开信最后斥责罗斯福夫人说：“你的态度表明了你企图隐瞒真相，掩饰美国政府在朝鲜战争中的罪行，并且已在全世界妇女面前显露你是这一个违反人道的罪行的同谋犯。全世界妇女不是根据你的言论，而是根据你的行动来判断你的。”
