The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Instructions on Completing the Annual Capital Construction and Industrial Production Plan within the Fourth Quarter" on September 30th. It requires Party committees at all levels in the Northeast, especially urban Party committees, as well as all Party members and workers in state-owned industries, to adopt the most active attitude and make every effort to complete this year's state plan and the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, and to prepare for next year's production and capital construction.

The Northeast Bureau's instructions analyzed the situation of state-owned industrial production and capital construction in the Northeast, pointing out that capital construction and industrial production in August and September made great progress compared with July. In terms of capital construction, by the end of the third quarter, the system of the Northeast Industrial Department had completed 60.9% of the total annual planned workload. The progress of the project increased month by month, with only 8% of the annual plan completed in July, 12% in August, and 18% in September. The construction projects with investments of over 10 billion yuan in provinces and cities also made great progress in August and September, and the quality of the projects also improved. In terms of industrial production, by the end of September, the factories and mines under the Industrial Department were expected to complete 79% of the annual state plan (calculated based on the total value of production); the plan for increasing production and practicing economy was expected to complete the task of 4.47 million tons of grain, which is equal to 89.5% of the department's original annual plan for increasing production and practicing economy. The production situation of local state-owned industries also improved in August and September.

However, the instructions pointed out: In the first three quarters of this year, the state plan was only completed in terms of total production value. The quality and variety of some products have not yet met the state plan and the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, especially the completion of the plan for increasing production and practicing economy after mass discussion is not very good. In capital construction projects, only civil engineering and general engineering have been completed well, while installation engineering and important projects have been completed poorly. The task in the fourth quarter is extremely arduous, because in this quarter, not only must the state's production plan, capital construction plan, and plan for increasing production and practicing economy be completed this year, but also preparations must be made for next year's capital construction and industrial production.

In order to complete the tasks of the fourth quarter, the instructions pointed out: In terms of capital construction, the leading organs of Party committees and industrial departments at all levels should put the leadership of capital construction in the primary position, and immediately correct any tendency to relax the leadership of capital construction or put it in a secondary position. In order to ensure the completion of this year's capital construction plan, special attention should be paid to the following: (1) Strengthen the leadership of installation engineering and overcome the idea of neglecting installation work. To this end, first of all, strengthen equipment management, sort out equipment orders, and find out which orders have arrived and which have not, so as to have a clear understanding and overcome the confusion in equipment management. Secondly, formulate specific construction plans for installation engineering, establish a strict installation responsibility system, and prevent damage to equipment. Before foreign orders are installed, the instructions must be translated to familiarize oneself with the variety and performance of the equipment, and "pre-installation" should be carried out as much as possible to ensure the smooth progress of the installation work. Thirdly, strengthen the Party's work and mass work in installation engineering, check and summarize the experience of the Party's work and mass work in installation engineering, and promote advanced experience among the masses in a timely manner. (2) In terms of civil construction, first of all, on the principle of ensuring quality standards, strive to complete the civil construction project before freezing. To this end, vigorously promote the advanced experience of parallel flow operation method of construction, which is the key to completing the construction plan ahead of schedule. Secondly, since the current civil construction projects have entered the stage of high-altitude operations and final completion, it is necessary to strengthen the safety work of high-altitude operations and the supply of hardware (such as plumbing, electrical, etc.). Thirdly, when certain projects cannot be fully completed before freezing, all difficulties should be overcome and the concrete, brickwork, and other parts of the project should be completed before freezing. Some winter construction units should immediately step up various preparations to ensure winter construction. In short, in installation engineering and civil construction, it is necessary to vigorously promote advanced experiences that ensure quality and complete the project on schedule, and constantly criticize the erroneous thinking of those who do not study new problems, do not listen to the opinions of the masses, do not pay attention to making construction plans, do not take concrete measures to complete the plan, and do not pay attention to improving the working and living conditions of workers, but unilaterally emphasize objective difficulties, so as to ensure the completion of this year's capital construction plan.

In addition, the instructions require that the following important preparations for next year's capital construction must be made in the fourth quarter, otherwise, next year's capital construction tasks cannot be completed. Therefore, the following work must be done effectively:

(1) Strengthen the leadership of design work, promote advanced experience in design work, especially learn from the advanced design experience of the Soviet Union (including promoting the advanced experience of standard design in civil construction projects such as offices, school dormitories, etc.). Leading cadres and technicians of the design department must go to this year's construction site in a timely manner to understand the situation, examine the advantages and disadvantages of design work from the actual situation of the construction site, so as to improve and improve the quality of future design and improve design efficiency, and do a good job in design work. This is the primary issue of whether construction can be carried out on schedule next year and whether the capital construction plan can be completed. Party groups of Party committees and administrative departments of enterprises at all levels must continue to transfer technical personnel to enrich the design department, strengthen the inspection and review of design work, strengthen the scientific management of design work, establish various responsibility systems in design work, strengthen the political and ideological education of technical personnel in the design department, and establish and implement the reward system in the design department. (2) Summarize experience and train cadres. This is extremely important work for improving cadres and doing a good job in next year's capital construction. Each engineering company should immediately start from engineering management (especially the responsibility system in engineering management), improving technology, improving tools, improving labor organization, quota management, wage system, financial cost management, and political work and security work, to formulate a plan for summarizing various advanced experiences, and summarize them in batches and divisions. And the actual experience summed up should be linked to next year's tasks, and education should be carried out among cadres. In addition, the province (city) and the engineering company should be used as units to train the grassroots cadres and activists of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League in engineering units in batches. All leading personnel of the engineering unit must learn and be able to master the main advanced experiences, especially the advanced construction management methods of parallel flow operation according to the instruction chart, and the methods of conducting political work in the capital construction engineering unit. This is an extremely important issue to ensure the successful completion of next year's construction project. (3) Fix 70,000 construction workers and properly handle temporary workers. First of all, fix skilled workers as long-term construction workers. All long-term capital construction workers should be trained this winter. The main contents are: summarizing and promoting advanced technical operation experience according to the type of work, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and conducting systematic political education and political work. As for the temporary workers of each engineering unit, the labor employment committees of each province (city) must also study them as soon as possible and properly handle them. (4) On the basis of summarizing experience and training and educating cadres, reorganize the organization, promote cadres (especially promote activists from workers to serve as construction workers and other responsible work), strengthen the trade union organization, develop the organization of the Party and the Communist Youth League, clean up bad people, and purify the ranks of capital construction workers. (5) Do a good job in the preparation and storage of various materials. According to the needs of each engineering company, where it is necessary and has the conditions to establish affiliated enterprises (such as wood factories, steel bar factories, etc.), they should be planned and established as soon as possible. According to the needs of construction, plan and organize local state-owned enterprises and private enterprises to produce hardware (plumbing, electrical materials, etc.) as soon as possible to prevent this from affecting the construction period next year. (6) Party committees and governments of all cities should formulate urban construction plans in accordance with the long-term construction policy in the future. From next year, all urban construction must be carried out according to plan. Before the start of new construction projects next year, roads should be repaired first. And transport red bricks, sand, and stones to the construction site (specify a reasonable location in advance) to reduce waste. In addition, the safety and welfare of employees (including the planning of fixed workers' dormitories this winter) must also be made with careful planning and carried out as soon as possible.

3. In terms of industrial production, comprehensively completing this year's state production plan and the plan for increasing production and practicing economy is still the most central task of factory and mine production in the fourth quarter. However, attention should be paid to preventing the tendency to unilaterally emphasize increasing labor intensity, neglecting quality, and neglecting safety. Those practices that unilaterally pursue quantity, work overtime, and do not pay attention to personal safety and the safety of machinery and equipment are wrong and must be opposed. Leading cadres of Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League at all levels of enterprises must recognize that the basic situation in enterprises at present is: advanced plans, high enthusiasm of the masses, and many advanced experiences, but the leadership of production management and political work cannot keep up, so after the promotion of some advanced experiences, unreasonable phenomena such as equipment imbalance, unreasonable labor organization, increased accidents, and increased non-production time have appeared in many enterprises. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, in addition to continuing to organize patriotic labor competitions and vigorously promoting advanced experiences with decisive significance, in order to achieve the comprehensive completion of the plan under the condition of ensuring product quality, improving production management and solving safety and welfare issues should be the central work in factories and mines in the coming period.

After elaborating on the various aspects that should be paid attention to in improving production management and safety and welfare work, the instructions continued to point out: Continuing to strengthen political work is one of the keys to ensuring the completion of the state's basic construction plan and industrial production plan. The political work of the capital construction department must be carried out according to the characteristics of the capital construction department: (1) Temporary workers and small-scale peasant producers account for a large proportion in the construction industry; the composition of leading personnel, especially staff and technicians, of some engineering companies is quite impure, and the organizations of the Party and the masses are very weak. Therefore, political organs must be established in engineering companies, engineering offices, and important construction sites, first of all, vigorously strengthen trade union work, rely closely on trade union organizations, examine the composition, clean up bad people. Educate activists, unite the broad masses of workers, improve their awareness, actively and step by step develop the organization of the Communist Youth League, and individually and cautiously absorb conscious members to participate in the organization of the Party in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution to strengthen the leadership of the Party. (2) Due to the large proportion of small peasant producers in the construction industry, and the production method is mostly backward handicraft production methods, and individual labor still accounts for a large proportion, it is necessary to improve the class consciousness of workers, stimulate their labor enthusiasm, launch a mass "finding tricks" movement, improve production tools and production methods, improve labor organization, vigorously promote various advanced experiences, especially learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and gradually mechanize and industrialize production, which will greatly improve labor productivity. This is a long-term and fundamental political and economic task of the political work in the capital construction department. (3) Due to the existence of the first two characteristics, the old management methods of the capital construction department—the style of the foreman, the guild ideology, and other feudal remnants have not been completely eradicated, and in a hidden state, they hinder the implementation of new management methods, which requires continuing to carry out the work of eliminating the foreman and eradicating the style of the foreman and guild ideology according to the specific circumstances, and combining this work to strengthen the education of the democratic management system and implement the democratic management system. (4) Due to the concentration of construction time and the dispersion of construction sites, as well as the construction of different types of work in the same place. In order to reduce waste, ensure quality, and complete the project according to plan, the most fundamental measure is to gradually realize year-round operation and staged flow operation, and at present, it is mainly to promote the advanced management method of parallel flow operation in accordance with the instruction chart. At present, the Party organization and mass organizations need to supervise and assist the administrative management department with more energy to establish and improve various responsibility systems, make material and tool supply plans in a timely manner and allocate them to the site according to the plan, make monthly, semi-monthly, and daily construction operation plans (including the cooperative operation plans of various types of work), stipulate the technical operation procedures of each type of work, and strict inspection and acceptance systems; on the other hand, Party and mass work cadres also need to go deep into the construction site and worker sheds to work regularly, so as to understand the situation in a timely manner and discover and solve problems. At the same time, the Party organization and mass organizations should call on and specifically organize their members to lead all employees with their exemplary role to overfulfill their plans every day in an all-round way. (5) Since construction enterprises are new enterprises, and they are seasonal and mobile, the labor insurance welfare conditions and reward work of employees are worse than those of production factories and mines, and the workplaces are mostly open-air operations and high-altitude operations, special attention must be paid to labor insurance, safety, and welfare work. At present, the Party organization and mass organizations should first assist the administration in doing a good job in the wage work of employees, especially piece-rate wage work, safety work for high-altitude operations and open-air operations, labor insurance registration work, medical work for employee diseases, employee accommodation, meals, drinking water, and employee cultural and recreational activities.

The decision finally pointed out the tasks of political work in factories and mines as follows: (1) Strengthen the Party's specific leadership over the trade union and the Communist Youth League, do a good job in political and ideological leadership, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and fight against various erroneous ideas and styles at any time; (2) Organize forces to go deep into factory and mine workshops to check work, and solve problems in production management and Party and mass work in a timely manner; (3) Face the grassroots, go deep into the grassroots, cultivate typical examples, and specifically help the grassroots to summarize the experience in grassroots work, thereby improving grassroots work; (4) Strengthen the leadership of the provincial (municipal) Party committee over local factory and mine enterprises, and unify the work pace of various systems and departments of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League; (5) According to the instructions of the Northeast Bureau, do a good job in democratic make-up lessons and Party consolidation work.

    东北局关于第四季度内完成全年基本建设与工业生产计划的指示（摘要）
    中共中央东北局，于九月三十日发布“关于第四季度内完成全年基本建设与工业生产计划的指示”，要求东北各级党委特别是城市党委，以及国营工业中的全体党员和全体职工，要以最积极的态度，全力完成今年国家计划和增产节约计划，做好明年生产与基本建设的准备工作。
    东北局的指示分析了东北国营工业生产和基本建设的情况，指出八、九月份的基本建设和工业生产比七月份都有很大的进步。在基本建设方面，至第三季末，东北工业部系统完成全年计划工作总量的百分之六十点九。工程进度逐月增长，七月份只完成全年计划的百分之八，八月份完成百分之十二，九月份则完成百分之十八。省市投资百亿以上的建筑工程，八、九月份亦有很大的进展，工程质量亦有改善。在工业生产方面，至九月底，工业部所属厂矿，预计完成全年国家计划的百分之七十九（按生产总值计算）；增产节约计划预计完成四百四十七万吨粮食的任务，等于该部原订的全年增产节约计划的百分之八十九点五。地方国营工业的生产情况，八、九月份亦有好转。
    但是，指示指出：今年的前三季度内仅仅在生产总值上完成了国家计划，在某些产品的质量和产品的品种方面，还没有完成国家计划和增产节约计划，特别是经群众讨论后的增产节约计划的完成情况还不很好；基本建设工程，也只是土建工程和一般工程完成得好，而安装工程和重要工程则完成得差。第四季度的任务是极其繁重的，因为在这个季度内，不仅要完成今年国家的生产计划、基本建设计划和增产节约计划，而且必须同时做好明年的基本建设和工业生产的准备工作。
    为了完成第四季度的任务，指示指出：在基本建设方面，各级党委和工业部门的领导机关应把对基本建设的领导放在首要地位，立即纠正任何放松对基本建设的领导或将其放在次要地位的倾向。为了保证今年基本建设计划的完成，目前应特别注意：（一）加强安装工程的领导，克服忽视安装工作的思想。为此，首先要加强设备管理工作，清理设备订货，查清哪些订货已到，哪些未到，作到心中有数，克服设备管理上的混乱现象。其次，具体制订安装工程施工计划，建立严格的安装责任制度，防止设备的损坏。国外订货在安装以前，必须将说明书译出以熟悉设备品种与性能，并尽量进行“预安装”，以保证安装工作的顺利进行。再次，加强安装工程中的党的工作与群众工作，检查与总结安装工程中党与群众工作经验，对于群众中的先进经验，要及时加以推广。（二）土木建筑方面，首先应在保证质量标准的原则下，争取结冻之前完成土建工程，为此要大力推广平行流水作业法的施工先进经验，这是提前完成施工计划的关键所在。其次，由于目前土建工程，都已进入高空作业与最后完工阶段，因之必须加强高空作业的安全工作与五金器材（如水暖、电气等）的供应工作。再次，某些工程在结冰前不能全部完工时，则应克服一切困难，在结冰前完成混凝土、砌砖等部分的工程。某些冬季施工单位应立即加紧各种准备工作，以保证冬季施工。总之，在安装工程与土建工程中，要以大力推广保证质量、按期完工的先进经验，经常批判那种不钻研新的问题，不倾听群众意见，不注意做好施工计划，不采取具体措施完成计划，不注意改善工人的劳动条件与生活条件，而片面强调客观困难的错误思想，从而保证今年基本建设计划的完成。
    此外，指示要求第四季度内必须作好明年基本建设的各项重要准备工作，否则，明年的基本建设任务就无法完成。因此必须切实做好下列工作：
    （一）加强设计工作的领导，推广设计工作的先进经验，特别是学习苏联的先进设计经验（包括在机关、学校宿舍等土建工程中推行标准设计的先进经验）。设计部门的领导干部与技术人员必须及时地到今年的施工现场中去了解情况，从施工现场的实际中去考核设计工作中的优点与缺点，以便改进与提高今后设计的质量并提高设计效率，作好设计工作。这是明年能否按期施工，能否完成基本建设计划的首要问题。各级党委各企业行政部门的党组必须继续抽调技术人员充实设计部门，加强设计工作的检查与审查，加强设计工作的科学管理，建立设计工作中的各种责任制度，加强设计部门技术人员的政治思想教育工作，建立与实行设计部门的奖励制度。（二）总结经验，训练干部。这是提高干部与做好明年基本建设极为重要的工作。各工程公司应即着手从工程管理（特别是工程管理中的责任制）、改进技术、改进工具、改善劳动组织、定额管理、工资制度、财务成本管理与政治工作、保安工作等方面，拟定出总结各种先进经验的计划，分批分工进行总结。并将总结出的实际经验联系明年任务，在干部中进行教育。此外，应以省（市）与工程公司为单位，分批轮训工程单位党、行政、工会、青年团的基层干部与积极分子。务使所有工程单位的领导人员，学会并能掌握主要的几种先进经验，特别是按指示图表进行平行流水作业的先进施工管理方法，与在基本建设工程单位进行政治工作的方法，这是保证明年建设工程胜利完成的极为重要的问题。（三）固定七万建筑工人，妥善处理临时工。首先把有技术的工人固定下来，作为长年建筑工人。所有长年基本建设工人，今冬应加以训练，主要内容是：按工种总结与推广先进技术操作经验，学习苏联的先进经验，进行系统的政治教育与政治工作。至于各工程单位的临时工，各省（市）劳动就业委员会，亦须及早专门研究，加以妥善的处理。（四）在总结经验、训练教育干部的基础上整顿机构，提拔干部（特别要提拔工人中的积极分子担任施工员及其他负责工作），壮大工会组织，发展党与青年团的组织，清洗坏人，纯洁基本建设工人的队伍。（五）作好各项材料的准备工作与储备工作。各工程公司根据需要，凡需要并有条件建立附属企业（如木工厂、铁筋工厂等）的，均应及早筹划建立。根据建设需要及早计划与组织地方国营企业与私营企业生产五金器材（水暖、电气材料等），防止因此影响明年工期。（六）各城市党委、政府均应根据今后长期建设的方针，制订城市建设计划。自明年起所有城市建设均需按计划进行。明年新建工程在正式开工之前，应首先修好道路。并将红砖、砂、石运到工地（事先指定合理地点），以减少浪费。此外，职工的安全福利（包括今冬固定工人宿舍的筹划）工作，亦必须作出周密的计划，及早进行。
    三、在工业生产方面，全面完成今年的国家生产计划与增产节约计划仍是第四季度厂矿生产中最中心的任务。但要注意防止片面强调提高劳动强度，忽视质量，忽视安全等偏向。那种片面追求数量，加班加点，不注意人身安全与机电设备安全的做法都是错误的，必须加以反对。各级企业党、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部必须认识，目前企业中的基本情况是：计划先进，群众情绪高涨，先进经验很多，但生产管理与政治工作的领导则跟不上，因而在某些先进经验推广之后，在很多企业中出现了设备不平衡，劳动组织不合理，事故增多，非生产时间增加等不合理的现象。因之，第四季度内除继续组织爱国主义劳动竞赛，大力推广有决定意义的先进经验，以达到在保证产品质量的条件之下全面完成计划之外，在厂矿企业中应将改善生产管理，解决安全福利问题，作为今后一个时期内的中心工作来进行。
    指示在阐述了改善生产管理与安全福利工作应注意的各个方面以后，继续指出：继续加强政治工作，是保证完成国家基本建设计划和工业生产计划的关键之一。基本建设部门的政治工作，必须根据基本建设部门的特点进行：（一）建筑工业中临时工人与农民小生产者占有很大的比重；某些工程公司领导人员特别是职员与技术人员的成份相当不纯，而党与群众的组织则很薄弱。因之，工程公司工程处与重要的工地，必须建立政治机关，首先以大力加强工会工作，紧紧依靠工会组织，审查成份，清洗坏人。教育积极分子，团结广大职工群众，提高其觉悟，积极地有步骤地发展团的组织，并按党章规定，个别慎重地吸收觉悟分子参加党的组织，以加强党的领导。（二）由于建筑工业中农民小生产者成份的比重大，其生产方式又多是落后的手工业生产方法，个体劳动还占很大的比重，因之，提高职工的阶级觉悟，启发其劳动积极性，发动群众性的“找窍门”运动，改善生产工具与生产方法，改善劳动组织，大力推广各种先进经验，特别是学习苏联的先进经验，使生产逐渐机械化、工厂化，必将大大地提高劳动生产率。这是基本建设部门中政治工作长期而根本的政治与经济任务。（三）由于前两个特点的存在，基本建设部门旧的管理方法——把头作风、行会思想等封建余孽尚未完全根除，且以隐蔽的状态，阻碍新的管理方法的贯彻，这就需要根据具体情况，继续进行清除把头与肃清把头作风与行会思想的工作，并结合这一工作加强民主管理制度的教育与贯彻民主管理制度。（四）由于施工时间的集中与施工现场的分散，以及不同工种在同一场合施工。为了减少浪费，保证质量与按计划完工，最根本的措施是逐渐实现常年作业及分段流水作业，而在目前则主要是推广按指示图表实行平行流水作业的先进管理方法。目前需要党的组织与群众组织一方面以更多的精力监督与协助行政管理部门建立与健全各种责任制度，及时作好材料、工具供应计划并按计划调拨到现场，作好月、旬、日的施工作业计划（包括各工种的配合作业计划），规定各工种的技术操作规程以及严格的检查与验收制度；另方面亦需要党、群众工作干部经常深入工地、工棚进行工作，以便及时了解情况，发现与解决问题。同时党组织与群众组织应号召并具体组织自己的成员，以自己的模范作用，带领全体职工，每日超额地全面完成自己的计划。（五）由于建筑企业是新的企业，加以季节性与流动性大，职工的劳保福利条件与奖励工作较生产厂矿均差，而作业场所则多为露天作业与高空作业，尤须注意劳保、安全与福利工作。目前党组织与群众组织应首先协助行政作好职工的工资工作特别是计件工资工作，高空作业与露天作业的安全工作，劳保登记工作，职工疾病的医疗工作，职工的住宿、吃饭、喝水以及职工的文化娱乐工作等。
    决定最后指出目前厂矿企业中政治工作的任务如下：（一）加强党对工会、青年团的具体领导，作好政治思想领导，开展批评与自我批评，随时与各种错误思想作风作斗争；（二）组织力量深入厂矿车间检查工作，及时解决生产管理与党、群众工作中的问题；（三）面向基层，深入基层，培养典型，具体帮助基层总结基层工作中的经验，从而提高基层工作；（四）加强省（市）委对当地厂矿企业的领导，统一党、行政、工会、青年团各系统各部门的工作步调；（五）根据东北局的指示，作好民主补课与整党工作。
