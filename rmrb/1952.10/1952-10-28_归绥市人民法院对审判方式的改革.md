    Reform of the Trial Method by the Gui Sui Municipal People's Court
    Ai Ding
    After the "Three-Anti" Movement, especially after learning the lessons of the Zhang Shunyou incident, the Gui Sui Municipal People's Court of Suiyuan Province further examined bureaucratic tendencies and adopted a new method of open, public trials in judicial work. It initially implemented the mass line, further connected with the masses, and played a significant role in publicizing policies and laws.
    In the past, the Gui Sui Municipal People's Court had conducted some investigation and research work in its trial work and implemented public pronouncements of verdicts, making some reforms to the old judicial system and style. However, most trial personnel were too deeply influenced by old legal concepts. They did not pay enough attention to investigation and research, did not care about the sufferings of the masses, lacked political responsibility, and had vague policy viewpoints. As a result, undesirable work styles such as sitting in court and questioning, subjective conjecture, and shirking responsibility still existed in trial work. Consequently, many cases were wrongly judged, and errors infringing upon human rights occurred. Assistant Judge Li Jinlu handled Zhang Shunyou's wage issue based on one-sided materials and subjectively wrongly sentenced Zhao Baoshan, who had no concrete evidence of guilt, to three years of imprisonment for theft. These are clear examples. After the "Three-Anti" Movement, in order to thoroughly eliminate these old ideas, old systems, and old work styles, the Gui Sui Municipal People's Court, in addition to establishing a system of hierarchical responsibility, a work reporting system, and a system for handling letters from the masses, established a system of open trials in trial work. The civil and criminal cases accepted by the court, except for a few that were inconvenient to be tried publicly, were mostly placed in street-facing courtrooms for public trials. The masses could freely attend the court hearings and raise questions and opinions to the judges and the cases they were trying.
    Experience has shown that this trial method can help the People's Court correctly try cases and make the connection between the People's Court and the masses closer. During trials, many attending people can offer useful opinions. For example, before the trial of the case of Song Renying's abuse of her grandson Chen Ningsheng, the court's opinion was to sentence Song Renying to imprisonment. During the public trial, when soliciting opinions from the masses, someone suggested: "Song Renying works very well and sends her grandson to school. She just shouldn't beat and scold the child. If she is sentenced to imprisonment, relying solely on her daughter (Chen Ningsheng's stepmother) to spin wool will not be enough to support the lives of three people, and the child's schooling will also become a problem." Based on the opinions of the masses, the court staff, after research, still sentenced Song Renying to six months in prison, but suspended the sentence for six months and had Song Renying make a self-criticism in front of the masses. The masses were very satisfied with this judgment, and Song Renying no longer abused Chen Ningsheng afterwards. The active opinions of the attending people greatly strengthened the sense of responsibility of the judges. Every judge deeply felt that in order to explain the case clearly to the masses in court and explain the policies, they had to conduct serious investigations and research and carefully study the policies and laws before the trial, otherwise, the trial could not be conducted. The past styles of subjective conjecture, one-sided handling, failure to explain policies, sitting in court and questioning, and shirking responsibility are no longer feasible.
    The attending people, seeing that the judges could accept their opinions, further enhanced their sense of ownership and actively assisted the judges in their work, providing evidence and materials for the cases, and refuting those parties who deliberately quibbled in court. On July 15th of this year, Li Xiufeng, a petty thief who had undergone labor reform but had not been completely reformed, stole a pouch and five thousand yuan from Yu Sifu, a cart worker. Yu Sifu discovered this at the time and sent him to court. Li Xiufeng did not admit it, saying that he had picked it up, and claimed to be a farmer who had come to the city to buy things. The judge saw that he did not look like a farmer and conducted a public trial of the case. During the trial, Li Xiufeng still quibbled. At this time, a person who had undergone reform with Li Xiufeng stood up and questioned Li Xiufeng: "Why are you still doing this? The government sincerely helped us reform, you should not commit another crime. Old brother, I advise you to tell the truth." The attending people all laughed and said to Li Xiufeng: "Those who were with you in the past have all spoken, why haven't you?" Li Xiufeng finally told the truth.
    In terms of publicizing policies and laws, because it can be combined with specific cases for publicity, it is particularly persuasive. The process of ideological transformation of Li Lingxia, a citizen of the Second District, is a vivid example. Li Lingxia once arranged her son's marriage single-handedly. After her son got married, he ran away from home because he was dissatisfied with the marriage, and wrote home repeatedly asking for a divorce. Li Lingxia did not agree. However, after attending several public trials of marriage disputes, because he personally witnessed the pain and misfortune caused by arranged marriages and buying and selling marriages to young men and women, he recognized the harm of the feudal marriage system and wrote to his son, agreeing to his divorce. He also said to others: "I will no longer interfere with my second son's marriage, let them handle it according to the Marriage Law!" Because the court can combine the handling of cases with the publicity of policies and laws, the policy level of the masses has been improved, and some disputes can be resolved by themselves. For example, before Wang Shoulan divorced her husband, both parties negotiated the distribution of property, alimony, and who would raise the child in a reasonable and legal manner, and then went to the government to obtain a divorce certificate. The phenomenon of men and women arguing in court over the division of property and who would raise the child no longer exists.
    In order to comprehensively publicize policies, the court often organizes several cases of the same nature but with different circumstances for sentencing. On one occasion, two divorce cases with different circumstances were resolved simultaneously: In the first case, the woman requested a divorce. Based on the materials from the investigation and research and the circumstances revealed by both parties in court, the court knew that they had always had a good relationship in the past, but had only recently had a quarrel and requested a divorce. Therefore, they were reconciled in court. The second case was a divorce case filed by the man. The court learned in advance that their marriage was arranged by their parents and that they had always had a bad relationship. However, during the trial, in order to continue to find a way to reconcile them, the judge tried various methods, such as inviting the parents of both parties to court to persuade them to reconcile and soliciting opinions from the masses. However, the man insisted on divorcing. Until the end, not only did the parents of both parties and the attending people unanimously believe that they had no other choice but to divorce, but even the woman, who had originally insisted on not divorcing, agreed to divorce. Thus, the court ruled for divorce. Some people personally saw that the court handled divorce cases so carefully, and then realized that their past misconceptions of the People's Court as "only judging divorce cases" and "women can get divorced unconditionally, while men need 'eight conditions' to get divorced," etc., were distortions of policy. Another trial of a rent dispute case also corrected the misconception that "the countryside distributes the land of landlords, and the city will also distribute houses in the future."
    The court's comprehensive publicity of policies and laws not only corrected many people's misconceptions about policies and laws but also prevented many disputes from occurring. The number of civil and criminal cases accepted by the Gui Sui Municipal People's Court is much less than in the past: the number of cases decreased by 46 percent from July 16th to August 15th compared to the period from June 15th to July 15th. In particular, there have been only four rent dispute cases in the most recent month, compared to twenty-six in the previous month.
    This mass line trial method has been welcomed and praised by the majority of citizens in Gui Sui. There are many people attending the court hearings every day, averaging three or four hundred people, including farmers who have come from the countryside specifically to participate. When trying some cases with greater educational significance, units such as the Democratic Women's Federation, trade unions, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce not only send representatives to sit in on the trials but also organize their masses to participate in formation. The masses all said in unison: "This way of trying cases is truly fair and selfless, truly doing things for our people."

    归绥市人民法院对审判方式的改革
    艾丁
    绥远省归绥市人民法院经过“三反”运动，尤其是接受了张顺有事件的教训，进一步检查了官僚主义之后，在司法工作方面采取了公开的当众审判的新方式，初步贯彻了群众路线，进一步联系了群众，在宣传政策法令上也起了很大作用。
    归绥市人民法院过去在审判工作中，也做过一些调查研究工作，并实行公开宣判，对于旧的司法制度与作风做过一些改革。但是一般审判人员由于受旧法观点的影响太深，不重视调查研究工作，不关心群众的疾苦，缺乏政治责任心，政策观点模糊，在审判工作中依然存在着坐堂问案、主观臆断以及推出了事等不良作风，因而也错判了不少案件，并发生过侵犯人权的错误。助审员李进录根据片面材料处理张顺有的工资问题，主观地把没有确实罪证的赵宝山以窃盗犯的罪名错判三年徒刑，都是显明的例子。“三反”运动以后，归绥市人民法院为彻底清除这种旧思想，旧制度、旧作风，除建立了逐级负责制、工作报告制及处理群众来信等制度以外，在审判工作方面建立了公开审判的制度，把法院所受理的民事、刑事案件，除少数不便公开审判的以外，大部都放在临街法庭上作公开审判。群众可以自由到法庭旁听，并对审判员及其所审理的案件提出问题和意见。
    经验证明，这种审判方式能够帮助人民法院正确地审理案件，并使人民法院和群众的联系更加密切。审判时，不少旁听群众能提出有益的意见。如审判宋任英虐待外孙陈宁生一案之前，法院的意见是对宋任英判处徒刑。当众审判时征求群众意见，有人提出：“宋任英劳动很好，还送外孙上学，就是不该打骂孩子。要是判她徒刑，单靠她女儿（陈宁生的继母）一人纺毛线，顾不来三个人的生活，小孩上学也成了问题。”法院工作人员根据群众的意见，经过研究，虽仍判处宋任英半年徒刑，但缓刑半年，并让宋任英在群众面前做了检讨。群众很满意这样判决；宋任英以后也不再虐待陈宁生了。旁听群众积极提出意见，大大加强了审判员的责任心。每一个审判员都深深地感觉到，自己要在法庭上当面向群众把案情交代清楚，讲明政策，就不能不在审判前认真进行调查研究，认真学习政策法令，否则就无法进行审判。过去那种主观臆断、片面处理、不说明政策以及坐堂问案、推出了事的作风，现在是再也行不通了。
    旁听的群众见审判员能接受他们的意见，就更加提高了主人翁的自觉，积极协助审判员进行工作，对案件提供证据，材料，并当庭驳斥那些故意狡赖的当事人。今年七月十五日，一个经过劳动改造但未改造好的小偷李秀峰偷了马车工人郁四甫的一个贴包和五千元。当时被郁四甫发觉，送到法院。李秀峰不承认，说是拾的，并自称是进城买东西的农民。审判员看他不像农民，便将此案进行当众审判。审判时，李秀峰仍然狡辩。这时一个曾和李秀峰一起经过改造的人站起来指问李秀峰：“你怎么还干这个？政府那样诚心帮助我们改造，你不应当再犯。老哥，我劝你还是说实话吧。”旁听的群众都笑了，并对李秀峰说：“过去和你一起的都说了，你还不说？”李秀峰最后说了实话。
    在宣传政策法令方面，因为能结合具体案件进行宣传，所以特别有说服力。第二区市民李凌霞思想转变的过程是一个生动的例子。李凌霞曾一手包办自己儿子的婚姻。他儿子结婚后，因为对婚姻不满而出走，三番五次写信回家要求离婚。李凌霞不同意。但他在旁听了几次婚姻纠纷案件的公开审理后，因为亲眼看到了父母包办婚姻和买卖婚姻给青年男女所造成的痛苦和不幸，他认识了封建婚姻制度的害处，便写信给他的儿子，赞成他离婚。他并对别人说：“我二儿子的婚事我再也不管了，让他们按婚姻法去办吧！”由于法庭能结合处理案件宣传政策法令，群众的政策水平提高了，有些纠纷便能自己解决了。如王寿兰和丈夫离婚前，双方把财产、生养补助费及孩子归谁抚养等问题都协商得合理合法，然后到政府领了离婚证。过去在法庭上男女双方因为分财产、孩子归谁抚养等纠纷争持不下的现象，现在都没有了。
    为了全面宣传政策，法庭常常把几件性质相同、案情不同的案件组织起来进行宣判。有一次同时解决了两件案情不同的离婚案：第一件是女方要求离婚，法庭根据调查研究的材料和男女双方当庭谈出的情况，知道他们过去一向感情很好，只是在最近发生口角，才提出离婚。于是便当庭予以调解和好。第二件是男方提出的离婚案。法庭事先了解他们结婚是父母包办的，一向感情不好。但在审判时，为了继续寻觅能够使他们和好的路子，审判员想了各种办法，如邀请双方的家长到庭劝和，征询群众的意见等。但男方坚决要离。直到最后，不但双方的家长和旁听的群众都一致认为他们除了离婚之外再没有其他办法可想，而且连原来坚持不离的女方也同意离婚了。这样法庭才判决离婚。有些人亲眼看到法庭处理离婚案件是如此慎重，才觉悟到过去把人民法庭看成“光判离婚官司”和“女方无条件也可以离婚，男方要‘八个条件’才能离婚”等等错误看法，是曲解了政策。另一次有关房租纠纷案件的审判，也纠正了某些人认为“农村分地主的土地，城市将来也要分房子”的错误看法。
    法庭全面地宣传政策法令，不但纠正了许多人对政策法令的错误认识，也防止了许多纠纷的发生。现在归绥市人民法院所受理的民事、刑事案件，比过去大大减少了：七月十六日到八月十五日一个月间，比六月十五日到七月十五日一个月间减少了百分之四十六。尤其是关于房租纠纷的案件，最近一个月只有四件，而过去一个月有二十六件。
    这种群众路线的审判方式，受到归绥广大市民的欢迎和称赞。每天开庭时，旁听的人都很多，平均每天有三、四百人，其中包括从农村特地赶来参加的农民。在审判一些教育意义较大的案件时，民主妇女联合会、工会、工商联合会等单位除派代表陪审外，并组织它们的群众整队参加。群众都异口同声说：“这样审案子真正公正无私，真是为咱们人民办事情。”
