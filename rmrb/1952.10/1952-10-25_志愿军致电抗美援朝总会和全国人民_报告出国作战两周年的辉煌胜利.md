Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 24th: The entire command and staff of the Chinese People's Volunteers, along with all combatants and workers, sent a telegram on the 24th to the Chinese People's Committee for Resistance to America and Aid Korea and the people of the nation, reporting the glorious victory of two years of fighting abroad and expressing their determination to fight to the end for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Chinese People's Committee for Resistance to America and Aid Korea and the people of the nation:

	In October 1950, in order to defend our beloved motherland and aid the Korean people, we crossed the Yalu River and fought alongside the heroic Korean People's Army against the American aggressors. Over the past two years, with the strong support and enthusiastic encouragement of the people of the motherland, we have crushed all of the enemy's offensives, large and small, and established a solid defensive line near the 38th parallel. In the fighting, we annihilated over 661,000 enemy troops, causing serious losses to American imperialism's manpower and resources. In particular, thanks to the enthusiastic donation movement for weapons launched by the people of the motherland, we have greatly improved our equipment and established a fairly strong artillery force, an excellent air force, and a young tank force. In the struggle against enemy aircraft, floods, and snowstorms, we have established a strong logistics transportation system suited to the requirements of modern warfare, ensuring that the front-line troops receive timely and adequate supplies. With the deep concern and direct assistance of the people of the motherland, we have also defeated the American aggressors' inhumane germ warfare and chemical warfare, further improving the health level of our troops and gaining valuable experience in anti-germ warfare and anti-chemical warfare. In these common struggles, we have established an unbreakable fighting friendship with the Korean People's Army and the Korean people, a friendship that guarantees we will closely coordinate to achieve final victory.

	We have heard from the Korean front that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, our motherland has made tremendous achievements in various construction projects and is about to embark on large-scale economic and cultural construction. The great motherland will steadily move towards a brighter and happier future along the path shown by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. This is the greatest encouragement for us, and it also makes us feel more keenly the importance of our own responsibilities.

	We deeply know that only by resisting and stopping the aggression of American imperialism can we ensure the peaceful construction of our motherland. Now, the American aggressors are even more blatantly indicating their intention to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations and conspire to expand the war. We hereby solemnly swear to the people of the motherland: We will continue to fight heroically, redouble our efforts to improve our combat effectiveness, constantly inflict heavier blows on the aggressors, carry the sacred cause of resisting America and aiding Korea to the end, and strive to defend Asian and world peace!

	Respectfully,

	The entire command and staff of the Chinese People's Volunteers, along with all combatants and workers.

	October 24th

    志愿军致电抗美援朝总会和全国人民
    报告出国作战两周年的辉煌胜利
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员暨全体工作人员二十四日致电中国人民抗美援朝总会并全国人民报告出国作战两周年的辉煌胜利，并表示为和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗到底的决心。电文如下。中国人民抗美援朝总会并全国人民：
    一九五零年十月，我们为了保卫可爱的祖国和援助朝鲜人民，跨过鸭绿江，与英雄的朝鲜人民军并肩抗击美国侵略者。两年来，我们在祖国人民大力支援和热情鼓舞下，已经粉碎了敌人的一切大小进攻，在三八线附近建立起一条巩固的防线，并在战斗中歼灭敌军六十六万一千余人，使美帝国主义的兵员和物资遭到严重的损耗。特别是由于祖国人民热烈地开展捐献武器的运动，使我们大大地改善了自己的装备，建立了相当强大的炮兵部队、优秀的空军和年青的战车部队。在与敌机、洪水和风雪的斗争中，我们建立了适合现代化战争要求的强大的后勤运输系统，使前线部队及时得到充足的物资供应。在祖国人民的深切关怀和直接帮助下，我们还打败了美国侵略者灭绝人性的细菌战和化学战，进一步提高了部队的健康水平，取得了反细菌战和反化学战的宝贵经验。在这些共同的斗争中，我们与朝鲜人民军、朝鲜人民建立了牢不可破的战斗友谊，这种友谊保证我们将密切协同地走向最后的胜利。
    我们在朝鲜前线听到祖国在毛主席的英明领导下，各项建设工作已经取得了巨大的成就，而且即将进行大规模的经济建设和文化建设。伟大的祖国将循着中国共产党和毛主席所昭示的道路，稳步走向更加光明和幸福的前途。这是对于我们的最大的鼓舞，因而也使我们更加感到自己责任的重大。
    我们深深知道：只有抵抗和制止美帝国主义的侵略，才能保障祖国的和平建设。现在，美国侵略者更露骨地表示它要破坏朝鲜停战谈判和阴谋扩大战争。我们特向祖国人民庄严宣誓：我们一定继续英勇战斗，百倍努力地提高自己的战斗力，不断予侵略者以更沉重的打击，把抗美援朝的神圣事业进行到底，并为保卫亚洲和世界和平而努力奋斗！
    中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员暨全体工作人员敬上
    十月二十四日
