In his speech, President Ding Xilin, on behalf of all members of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, congratulated the Indian delegation for their great contribution to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Ding Xilin pointed out that on the eve of this peace conference, the Indian people had universally launched the "Asia Week" and "Asia Day" movements, and had held regional peace conferences in various parts of India, selecting a broadly representative delegation, which fully demonstrated the Indian people's love for peace and their emphasis on this peace conference.

In his reply, delegation leader Kitchlew emphasized the importance of friendship between the Indian and Chinese people for defending world peace. He said that if the 350 million people of India and the 475 million people of China unite together, they can not only defend the peace of Asia, but also make a great contribution to defending world peace.

Deputy delegation leader Chand expressed the hope for the strengthening of friendship between the Chinese and Indian people. He said that in the movement to defend peace, Sino-Indian friendship will play a great role.

Ambassador Raghavan said, I am not speaking tonight as a diplomat, but as a newly arrived Indian in Beijing. I believe that when the representatives participating in the peace conference return to India, they will not only bring back the influence of the peace conference, but also bring back the sincere friendship of the Chinese people.

The banquet proceeded in a friendly atmosphere from beginning to end.
