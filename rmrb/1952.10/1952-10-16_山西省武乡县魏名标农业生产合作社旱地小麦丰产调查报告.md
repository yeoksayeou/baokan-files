Shanxi Province suffered severe natural disasters this year, resulting in widespread wheat yield reductions. However, the Wei Mingbiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zaoying Village not only avoided yield reduction but also achieved an overall bumper harvest, setting a high-yield record. This fully demonstrates the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives.

The Wei Mingbiao Agricultural Production Cooperative was established in March 1951 through the merger and reorganization of two model mutual aid teams. Initially, it had only nineteen households, later expanding to twenty-six households. The cooperative has a total of 447.7 mu of cultivated land (mostly hillside dryland), 44 laborers (including 23 full-time male laborers, 3 part-time male laborers, 8 full-time female laborers, and 10 part-time female laborers), 9 head of cattle, and 1 donkey. The cooperative makes rational use of labor and livestock, organizing them into three farming groups (7 to 10 people per group) to collectively manage all cultivated land, implementing a "contracted output with guaranteed production" system and recording work points based on piecework. Those who exceed their targets are commended and rewarded, while those who fail to meet their targets due to reasons other than natural disasters are given criticism or have their work points deducted. In addition, the cooperative also has a sideline occupation group (4 people) that operates a flour mill and raises 19 pigs, and a sheep herding group (5 people) that herds 223 sheep. The sideline occupation group and the sheep herding group have opened up sources of fertilizer for the cooperative's agricultural production, increasing fertilizer application by 70 percent compared to last year. The cooperative also established a technology group, a study group, and a hygiene group, and designated an "Patriotic Inspection Day." On ordinary days, they regularly check and revise the patriotic pact and production plans on "Patriotic Inspection Day," which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members, improved their political awareness and cultural level, and cultivated their collective consciousness. Everyone sees a bright future and loves the great motherland even more. In the patriotic production increase emulation campaign, all cooperative members worked hard to improve production techniques, thus obtaining a comprehensive bumper harvest of wheat. This year, the Wei Mingbiao Agricultural Production Cooperative harvested 29,090 jin of wheat from 100.7 mu, averaging 288.88 jin per mu, exceeding the average yield of ordinary farmers in the village by 140 percent, exceeding the average yield of mutual aid teams in the village by 74.54 percent, and exceeding the cooperative's average yield last year by 26 percent. Among them, 16.42 mu of high-yield land averaged 486.56 jin per mu, with the highest yield reaching 733.16 jin per mu, setting a new high-yield record for dryland wheat in Shanxi Province in 1952.

The high-yield experience of the 2.12 mu new record high-yield land of the Wei Mingbiao Agricultural Production Cooperative is as follows:

(1) Deep plowing, early plowing, water storage for seedling protection, carrying water and accumulating ice, and moisture conservation for drought prevention. The Zaoying Village area is a dryland farming area with one crop per year, and water storage and moisture conservation are crucial to ensuring a bumper harvest. In order to store summer rainwater, the Wei Mingbiao Agricultural Production Cooperative seized the time to shallowly plow once along the wheat rows with a plow without a moldboard immediately after the previous wheat crop was harvested, about four inches deep, in order to turn over the wheat stubble and break the soil surface to receive rainwater for deep plowing. During the Major Heat solar term, they used a seven-inch step plow with two large cattle plowing crosswise once, reaching a depth of seven inches. This deep plowing not only can receive a large amount of rainwater in the dog days of summer, weathering the soil and promoting the decomposition of organic matter, but also can turn over the weeds and stubble on the ground and bury them in the soil to increase the humus in the soil. At the same time, it turns the lower soil up, which becomes ripe soil after being exposed to the high heat of the dog days, and the air is easy to circulate, so that the organic matter in it is decomposed by bacteria into available nutrients for plants to use. At the same time, due to the deepening of the cultivated layer, the root system of wheat can develop better, expanding the absorption area of ​​the roots, making the stems strong and the roots solid, making it less prone to lodging. After this deep plowing, no harrowing was carried out, because the ground was uneven, and harrowing would increase the weathering area and rainwater would easily seep in. The third time was plowing diagonally, more than five inches deep, and still no harrowing after plowing. The fourth time was deep plowing of four or five inches during the Limit of Heat solar term, because at this time there was little rain, so harrowing was carried out immediately after plowing to loosen and crush the topsoil to prevent the water that had been received from being lost. The fifth plowing was five days after the White Dew solar term, using a plow without a moldboard for shallow plowing, about three inches deep. This was mainly to plow into wide ditches (about four inches) for sowing. After sowing, harrowing was carried out once, the purpose of which was to cover the soil and loosen the topsoil to reduce evaporation. When the seedlings were about to emerge, they were harrowed again, which could preserve moisture and break the hard crust of the topsoil, which was conducive to the emergence of seedlings. The cooperative not only focused on water storage and moisture conservation before and after sowing, but also paid attention to this work throughout the entire growth period of wheat. For example, before the winter freeze, the cooperative members carried more than 100 loads of water from the small stream at the foot of the mountain. The following year, they broke the ice in the small stream and moved it to the high-yield land, a total of more than 10,000 jin. They cultivated once again when the wheat turned green. Although there was no serious lack of rain during the growing season of wheat, this series of drought prevention measures provided a strong guarantee for a bumper harvest.

(2) Regulating soil, increasing base fertilizer, and timely topdressing. The south half of the high-yield land of the Wei Mingbiao Agricultural Production Cooperative is what is called black alkaline soil in the local area, which is more fertile. The north half is loess, and the soil is poor. In order to mix all the soil evenly, they exchanged thousands of catties of soil from the south half and the north half last year, so that they were mixed evenly. After the Beginning of Autumn, they pulled out the perennial alfalfa roots growing on the hillside and scraped thousands of catties of soil and spread it on the ground. This kind of soil is rich in aggregates and organic matter and is very fertile. After these two soil adjustments, the soil of the entire field became a mixed soil with a better structure, which made the wheat grow well. Because wheat is a crop that is "rich from the womb," they paid attention to applying sufficient base fertilizer. Before the second plowing, more than 300 sheep were used to lie down for two nights. According to the local calculation of three sheep lying down for one night to equal one load of manure, a total of more than 200 loads of sheep manure were applied. Before the third plowing, they lay down for another two nights, totaling 200 loads of sheep manure, and mixed with 30 loads of human manure and urine. During the fourth plowing, they applied four dou of half-cooked black beans and 40 loads of human manure and urine (mixed with hillside soil that had been scraped off and spread on the ground). A total of 470-480 loads of manure fertilizer (human and sheep manure) were applied before and after the 2.12 mu of land, plus four dou of black beans, with about 240 loads of base fertilizer applied per mu. They combined each plowing to apply fertilizer in different soil layers in stages, distributed very evenly, so that wheat could get sufficient nutrients everywhere after rooting. Because sheep manure had not been well composted, it was applied early. Sheep manure and human manure and urine were mixed and applied, because human manure and urine ferment quickly and can promote the timely decomposition of organic matter in sheep manure. At the same time, sheep manure contains more nitrogen and phosphorus elements, and human manure and urine and black beans are also rich in nitrogen, which can not only make wheat grow well, but also increase the cold resistance, drought resistance, and resistance to diseases and insect pests of wheat. On the third day after spring cultivation this year, they applied a mixed fertilizer of 617 jin of human manure and urine and pig manure and urine per mu of wheat field. This topdressing also played a certain role in increasing production, because microorganisms in the soil cannot quickly recover activity after a cold winter, and there are few available nutrients, and wheat seedlings after overwintering are often very weak and need to absorb a lot of nutrients to recover growth. Therefore, it is very important to apply fast-acting topdressing in a timely manner.

(3) Selecting fine varieties and implementing close planting. The wheat in the high-yield land of the Wei Mingbiao Agricultural Production Cooperative is called "Dabai Wheat," which is the best variety selected at the township, district, and county levels, and has excellent characteristics such as high yield, hard stalks, fertilizer resistance, lodging resistance, gall resistance, and tight grain. They have been planting this variety for several years and have been selecting seeds continuously for two years. Last year's seeds were selected from the field. When sowing, more than four qian of Ceresan was used to mix with every fifteen jin of seeds, and red alum bran was sprinkled on the wheat field to kill mole crickets. At the same time, they increased the amount of seeds and expanded the area occupied by seeds to implement close planting. They used their hands to evenly sow the seeds in the opened plow furrow, using 13 jin of seeds per mu, which is 60 percent more than the local general amount of seeds (about 8 jin). The row spacing was one chi, and the sowing width was about four cun. Because the seeds were sown evenly, there was a certain distance between each wheat grain, and they could all obtain a certain nutrient area and develop well. This sowing method makes full use of the land area per unit, with 74 spikes per square chi, a total of 444,000 spikes per mu, which is more than twice the number of wheat spikes per mu of ordinary farmers in the local area.

The wide-row strip planting in the high-yield land of the Wei Mingbiao Agricultural Production Cooperative basically conforms to the principle of close planting. However, in order to use the land more rationally and economically, the row spacing of one chi can be shortened to six cun. According to the calculation of one liang per thousand grains of "Dabai Wheat," the amount of sowing per mu can be increased from 13 jin to 18 jin or 20 jin. Last year, some of the cooperative's wheat fields were still planted by spot sowing. In order to strive for a greater harvest next year, all wheat fields should increase the amount of seeds, shorten the row spacing, and implement close planting.

    山西省武乡县魏名标农业生产合作社旱地小麦丰产调查报告
    中央人民政府农业部粮食生产司
    山西省武乡县今年小麦遭受了严重的自然灾害，普遍减产，惟有枣堙村魏名标农业生产合作社不但没有减产，相反地获得了全面丰收，并创造了高额丰产纪录。这充分地显示了农业生产合作社的优越性。
    魏名标农业生产合作社是在一九五一年三月由两个模范互助组合并改组成立的；最初只有十九户，后发展到二十六户。全社共有耕地四百四十七亩七分（大部是山坡旱地）；劳动力四四个（其中有男全劳动力二十三人、半劳动力三人，女全劳动力八人、半劳动力十人）；畜力有大牛九头，驴一头；新式农具有七寸步犁二部，五寸步犁一部，锄草机一部。社内的劳动力和畜力做到合理使用，共组成三个耕作组（每组七至十人），统一经营全部耕地，实行“包工保产”和按件记工，超额完成任务的加以表扬奖励，不是因天灾而不能完成任务的就酌情给予批评或扣劳动日。另外，社内还有一个副业组（四人），经营粉房一个，养猪十九头；一个牧羊组（五人），牧羊二百二十三头。副业组和牧羊组给全社的农业生产开辟了肥料来源，使今年施肥就比去年增加了百分之七十。社内并成立了技术小组、学习小组和卫生小组，定有“爱国检查日”，平时经常在“爱国检查日”检查修订爱国公约和生产计划，从而大大鼓励了社员们的生产积极性，提高了社员的政治觉悟和文化水平，培养了社员们的集体观念，大家看到美好的未来，更加热爱伟大的祖国。在爱国增产竞赛运动中，全体社员努力改进生产技术，因而获得了小麦的全面丰收。今年，魏名标农业生产合作社一百亩七分小麦，实收二万九千零九十斤，平均每亩产二百八十八点八八斤，超过村内一般农民的平均产量百分之一百四十，超过村内互助组平均产量百分之七十四点五四，超过该社去年平均产量百分之二十六；其中有十六点四二亩丰产地平均每亩产四百八十六点五六斤，最高每亩产七百三十三点一六斤，创造了一九五二年山西省旱地小麦丰产新纪录。
    魏名标农业生产合作社的二点一二亩新纪录丰产地的丰产经验如下：
    （一）深耕、早耕、蓄水保苗、担水积冰、养墒防旱。枣堙村一带是一年一熟制的旱作地区，蓄水保墒是保证丰收的重要一环。为了蓄纳夏天雨水，魏名标农业生产合作社在前作麦子收后，即抓紧时间用不带犁镜的犁顺麦行浅耕一次，深约四寸，目的在耕倒麦茬，划破地皮，以便接纳雨水，好行深耕。大暑节他们用七寸步犁，两头大牛横着耕一次，深达七寸；这样深耕不仅能接纳伏天的大量雨水，风化土壤，促进有机质分解的功效，并能将地面杂草残茬翻埋于土中增加土壤中的腐植质，同时把下层土壤翻上来，经伏天高热阳光曝晒，变成熟土，空气易于流通，使其中有机质经细菌分解作用，成为可给态的养料，供给植物利用。同时由于加深了耕层，小麦的根系能更好地发展，扩大了根的吸收面积，使茎杆壮健，根基巩固不易倒伏。这次深耕后不行耙耢，理由是地面凸凹不平，耙耢后将增大风化面积，雨水易于渗入。第三次是斜着耕的，深五寸多，耕后仍不耙耢。第四次在处暑节深耕四、五寸，因此时雨水已稀少，故耕后立即耙耢，使表土疏松细碎，阻止已接纳的水分散失。第五次犁地是在白露后五天，用不带犁镜的犁浅耕，深三寸左右；这次主要是犁成宽沟（约四寸），以便播种。在播种完后即耢一次，其作用是一面覆土，一面疏松表土，减少蒸发。在苗将要出土时又耢一次，可以保墒，同时打破表土硬壳，利于幼苗出土。该社不是单在播种前后着重蓄水保墒，而是在小麦整个生长期间都重视了这一工作。如在冬季结冰前，社员们从山坡下的小溪里担了一百多担水；次年又将小溪里的冰块打碎搬到丰产地，共搬了一万多斤；在麦子反青时又中耕了一次。虽然在小麦生长期中，雨水不十分缺乏；但这一系列的防旱措施，给丰收作了有力的保证。
    （二）调剂土壤、增施基肥、适时追肥。魏名标农业生产合作社的丰产地，南半部是当地的所谓黑卤土，土性较肥沃。北半部是黄土，土质较差。为着使全部土壤能混合一致，他们去年将南半部的土壤和北半部的土壤互相调换了数千斤，使彼此混合均匀。立秋后又将山坡上生长着多年生蓿根草拔下，括取了数千斤土，撒铺到地里；这种土壤富有团粒性和有机质，是很肥沃的。经过这两次的土壤调剂，全田的土壤变成了结构较好的混合土，使小麦生长良好。由于小麦是“胎里富”的庄稼，他们注意施足了基肥。在第二次耕地前以三百多头羊卧了两夜，按当地以三头羊卧一夜合一担粪计，共施羊粪二百多担；在第三次耕地前又卧了两夜，合羊粪两百担，并混合人粪尿三十担；在第四次耕地时施煮成半熟的黑豆四斗和人粪尿四十担（混拌括下的山坡土撒施到地里）；二点一二亩地前后共施粪肥
    （人、羊粪）四百七、八十担，加上黑豆四斗，每亩地施基肥约二百四十担。他们结合每次耕地分期施肥，将肥料耕翻在不同的土层中，分布很均匀，小麦扎根后到处可得充足的养料。因为羊粪未经过很好的沤腐，所以早期施用。羊粪和人粪尿混合施用，是由于人粪尿发酵快，可以促进羊粪中的有机质及时分解；同时，羊粪含氮、磷元素较多，人粪尿和黑豆的含氮量也很丰富，不仅能使小麦生长良好，并能增加小麦耐寒耐旱的能力和对病虫害的抵抗力。在今年春季中耕后第三日，他们在每亩麦地里追施了六百十七斤人粪尿和猪粪尿的混合肥料；这次追肥对增产也起了一定的作用，因为经过一个寒冬，土壤中微生物不能很快恢复活动，可给养料很少，而越冬后的麦苗常常是很衰弱的，需要吸收很多的养料来恢复生长；所以及时的施以速效性追肥是很重要的。
    （三）选用良种，实行密植。魏名标农业生产合作社丰产地的小麦叫“大白麦”，是乡、区、县三级当选的最优良品种，具有产量高、茎秆硬、耐肥、不倒伏、抗疸、口紧等优良特性。他们种植这一品种已有数年，并经过两年连续选种，去年的种子是田间穗选出来的。播种时，每十五斤种子用了四钱多赛雷散进行拌种，并使用红矾拌麸子撒到麦地里，以毒杀蝼蛄。同时，他们增加了种子量，扩大了种子占有面积，实行密植。他们在开好的犁沟内用手将种子均匀撒播，每亩用种量合十三斤，较当地一般用种量（八斤左右）多百分之六十；行距为一尺，播幅宽约四寸；由于种子撒播均匀，每颗麦粒之间有一定的距离，它们都能获得一定的营养面积而良好地发育生长。这种播种方法，使单位面积土地得到比较充分的利用，每平方尺内有七十四个穗子，每亩合四十四万四千个穗子，较当地一般农民每亩麦穗数要多出一倍以上。
    魏名标农业生产合作社丰产地的宽幅条播，基本上是合乎密植原则的；但为了更合理、更经济地利用土地，一尺的行距可缩短为六寸；播种量根据“大白麦”种每千粒重一两计，每亩可由十三斤增加到十八斤或二十斤。去年该社有一部分麦田仍用点播；为争取明年更大的丰收，全部麦田均应增加种子量，缩短行距，实行密植。
