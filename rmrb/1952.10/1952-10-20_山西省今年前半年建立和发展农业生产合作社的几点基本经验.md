Several Basic Experiences in Establishing and Developing Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Shanxi Province in the First Half of This Year
The Rural Work Committee of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    I. We must establish and develop agricultural production cooperatives steadily and actively.

    Last year, Shanxi Province piloted 57 agricultural production cooperatives in the old revolutionary base areas of Southeast Shanxi and Northwest Shanxi, and gained preliminary experience. This year, according to the instructions of the North China Bureau, we implemented the policy of steady and active development, and continued to establish agricultural production cooperatives on the basis of last year. As far as the whole province is concerned, agricultural production cooperatives are still in the trial stage. Therefore, we stipulate that the establishment of cooperatives must be based on a strong Party foundation and a good mutual aid team foundation as the primary conditions; at the same time, we must abide by the principles of mass voluntarism and leadership approval. From the autumn of last year to the spring of this year, the local Party committees conducted top-down investigations and research with emphasis and planning; and mobilized the masses in the villages preparing to establish cooperatives to conduct full deliberation. Subsequently, the responsible comrades of the local Party committees personally organized short-term training classes for village, district, and county-level cadres. The training content included the direction of rural production development, the basic policies of the mutual aid and cooperation cause, and the experience of the ten agricultural production cooperatives piloted in Changzhi Prefecture last year. A total of more than 800 people were trained in the province. During the training process, the villages that requested the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives were further reviewed, and those that did not meet the conditions were persuaded to postpone their establishment. In this way, 262 new cooperatives were established in the province this spring. After the summer harvest, Changzhi Prefecture established another 148 new cooperatives. Including those already established last year, there are now 467 cooperatives in the province.

    However, the development of agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province is very uneven. Shanxi has 90 counties, of which 33 counties have not yet established cooperatives, while Wuxiang County alone has 44. This situation must be changed step by step.

    Due to the implementation of a steady cooperative establishment policy, and due to the leading organs of Party committees and people's governments sending a large number of cadres to go deep into the villages to provide direct assistance, all agricultural production cooperatives in the province, except for one cooperative in Wangjiadian Village, Zuoquan County, which was suspended halfway due to problems, have achieved remarkable results in this year's patriotic production increase competition, and have played a great role in promoting the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement. However, it should be pointed out that some Party and government leading organs, when implementing the above-mentioned policy, only emphasized the steady side and ignored the active side, and their leadership thinking still has a certain degree of conservatism. This is the main reason for the uneven development of agricultural production cooperatives in the province.

    II. Agricultural production cooperatives have greatly promoted the rural patriotic production increase competition and the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    Since the beginning of spring this year, all parts of Shanxi have organized large-scale patriotic production increase competitions with agricultural production cooperatives as the core, and surrounding mutual aid groups and individual farmers. In the competition, each agricultural production cooperative used the method of mutual inspection and comparison to publicize the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives to the surrounding masses. Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Yang Fengshan in Pingshun, Wang Jinyun in Wuxiang, Shi Cunjin in Licheng, Zhang Zhiquan in Yushe, Dong Jinniu in Zuoquan, Wang Dianjun in Xiyang, and Guanmenqian in the suburbs of Taiyuan, and other agricultural production cooperatives, conducted "seven checks and seven comparisons" with the surrounding mutual aid groups and individual farmers (check the nature of the land and compare whether fertilization and sowing are done according to the land conditions; check the quality and quantity of fertilizer and compare superior varieties; check the quality of cultivation and compare the level of technology; check the surplus labor and compare the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations; check the amount of labor saved and compare the size of achievements; check political awareness and compare patriotic actions; check the patriotic production increase plan and compare the degree of completion of the plan). When the agricultural production cooperatives held evaluation and summary meetings, they invited representatives of mutual aid groups and village cadres from the village to participate, and used the method of organizing observation meetings to publicize the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics from nine counties including Licheng and Pingshun, a total of more than 4,000 Party members, village cadres, mutual aid group representatives, labor models, and propagandists participated in the observation meetings. Various counties also widely reported on agricultural production cooperatives to the masses through various meeting formats. In Wuxiang County, more than 23,000 village cadres and masses directly heard the reports, accounting for about one-seventh of the county's total population.

    Through inspection, evaluation, and extensive publicity, agricultural production cooperatives have greatly promoted the patriotic production increase competition and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Specifically, it is manifested in:

    First, many mutual aid groups are actively requesting or have begun to prepare to establish agricultural production cooperatives. Many individual farmers have joined mutual aid groups in order to participate in agricultural production cooperatives. Many people who used to doubt whether agricultural production cooperatives could be run well no longer doubt it. Party members, cadres, labor models, and advanced mutual aid groups in more than 4,000 villages around the agricultural production cooperatives are requesting or actively preparing to establish cooperatives. Under the impetus of agricultural production cooperatives, almost all individual households in Xiguxian Village, Tunliu, have joined mutual aid groups. Many temporary mutual aid groups have been transformed into year-round mutual aid groups in order to strive for early establishment of cooperatives. The rapid development and improvement of mutual aid groups in the province in the first half of this year is inseparable from the leading role of agricultural production cooperatives.

    Second, the abundant harvest experience of agricultural production cooperatives has been valued by the majority of farmers. After many rural cadres and propagandists in Yicheng visited the abundant harvest fields of Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiliang Village, they broke their conservative ideas and began to pay attention to the issue of improving technology. 174 Party members, cadres, labor models, and mutual aid group representatives from ten villages around Dazhai Village, Yushe, visited Zhang Zhiquan Agricultural Production Cooperative's abundant harvest fields and small farms, which not only increased their confidence in increasing production, but also learned many advanced experiences. There are many such examples.

    III. Several experiences in running agricultural production cooperatives well.

    First, strengthening the Party's political and ideological leadership is the key to running agricultural production cooperatives well. When cooperative establishment began this year, many people did not understand the nature of agricultural production cooperatives, and "three fears" of "being afraid of eating from a big pot," "being afraid of harvesting less grain," and "being afraid of not being free" occurred. Party committees at all levels used vivid examples of agricultural production cooperatives, combined with Comrade Gao Gang's article "On the Direction of Rural Economic Development," to conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and education to the masses, and concentrated their efforts to solve these ideological problems. The motives of the members to join the cooperative are different, the level of awareness is different, and the attitude towards agricultural production cooperatives is also different. Party organizations at all levels should often conduct political and ideological education for members. The Wuxiang County Committee studies the work of agricultural production cooperatives once a month, and holds a meeting of cooperative establishment cadres every two months. Each county committee member is specifically responsible for leading several cooperatives, responsible for studying and solving the ideological problems existing among members. The district Party committee secretaries personally grasp one or two cooperatives to create typical experiences; the district committee holds a meeting of county and district cadres stationed in villages to lead agricultural production cooperatives once a month to study the situation and exchange experiences. The Party branches of all villages in the county that have established agricultural production cooperatives must discuss the work of production cooperatives once a month; and establish Party groups within agricultural production cooperatives, using the exemplary role of Party members to unite and educate the masses. Therefore, the development of more than 40 agricultural production cooperatives in the county is normal and healthy. The members generally reflect: "Agricultural production cooperatives are like trains; Communist Party members are like the locomotive, leading us towards a happy society." The experience of most agricultural production cooperatives in the province proves that establishing political instructors, propagandists (or propaganda groups), reading groups, clubs, libraries, and "patriotic inspection day" systems within the cooperative is the best way for Party organizations to conduct daily political and ideological work for the masses inside and outside the cooperative.

    Second, we must implement the distribution policy of mainly distributing dividends based on labor in order to make agricultural production cooperatives develop firmly forward. However, when implementing the distribution policy of mainly distributing dividends based on labor, we must, according to the different actual conditions of various places, determine the proportion of dividends for land and labor appropriately after full discussion by the members. In terms of work evaluation and point calculation, most agricultural production cooperatives adopt the method of fixed scores and flexible evaluation, but a few cooperatives implement a piece-rate system. All of these different work recording methods should currently be allowed to exist according to the needs of the actual situation.

    Third, we must fully promote democracy and establish appropriate labor discipline in order to enable agricultural production cooperatives to fully exert the advantages of collective management. Now, in addition to implementing the principle of "voluntary participation and freedom to withdraw," agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province have established financial, meeting, work recording, work evaluation, reward and punishment, and other systems. All cooperatives stipulate that the members' congress is the highest authority organization within the cooperative, and the members' congress elects a cooperative affairs committee to specifically implement the resolutions of the members' congress. In terms of labor discipline, in general, according to the principle of simplicity and ease of implementation, it is stipulated that members must obey the unified allocation of the cooperative in labor production, must cherish public property, must participate in the cooperative's life review meetings, must ask for leave if there is something, and must not be late or leave early during labor. These democratic living systems and labor discipline regulations play a positive guarantee role in the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives.

    Fourth, agricultural production cooperatives must have a relatively long-term production and construction plan, and at the same time must continuously improve labor organization and pay attention to cultivating new technical talents. Many agricultural production cooperatives in the old liberated areas of Changzhi have formulated three-year or five-year production and construction plans this year, and the members generally feel that they have a goal to strive for, and their production enthusiasm is even higher. Some people used to be afraid of having too much surplus labor and not finding a way out, but now they are not worried about how much surplus labor they have. In order to realize the construction plan, there must be a set of scientific and reasonable labor organization and management system. In this regard, agricultural production cooperatives in various places do not yet have mature experience, and it is urgent to create, summarize, and promote successful experience. At present, agricultural production cooperatives in various places generally attach importance to the improvement of production technology, and have discovered a group of technical experts; however, most cooperatives do not pay enough attention to summarizing and promoting advanced production experience and cultivating technical talents in a planned way. This point should be paid attention to. In addition, in order for agricultural production cooperatives to realize larger construction plans in agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, etc., it is also very necessary to give timely financial support from state loans and strong support from supply and marketing cooperatives in the supply and marketing of production materials and agricultural and sideline products.

    Fifth, in the patriotic production increase competition, agricultural production cooperatives compare and observe each other with mutual aid groups and individual farmers, which is a good way to find shortcomings and improve work. For example, when Hao Qisheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in the fourth district of Yangcheng conducted comparison and observation with the masses, the masses outside the cooperative reflected: "The land processing in the cooperative is uneven, with more processing on good land and less processing on bad land; individual members have the idea of hiring labor." The cooperative immediately launched inspection, discussion, and mutual criticism based on this reflection, and solved these problems. The prestige of the cooperative increased accordingly.

    山西省今年前半年建立和发展农业生产合作社的几点基本经验
    中共山西省委农村工作委员会
    一、必须稳健地、积极地建立
    和发展农业生产合作社
    去年山西省在晋东南和晋西北老区试办了五十七个农业生产合作社，取得了初步的经验。今年，我们根据华北局的指示，贯彻稳健的积极的发展方针，在去年的基础上，继续建立农业生产合作社。就全省情况来说，目前农业生产合作社还处在试办时期，因此，我们规定：建社必须以党的基础较强、互助组基础较好为首要条件；同时必须遵守群众自愿和领导批准的原则。各地委从去年秋后到今年春天，都有重点、有计划地进行了自上而下的调查研究；并发动准备建社的村庄的群众，进行充分的酝酿。接着，各地委负责同志亲自主办了村、区、县三级干部的短期训练班。训练内容为农村生产发展方向，互助合作事业的基本政策和去年长治专区试办十个农业生产合作社的经验。全省共训练了八百余人。在训练过程中，对要求建立农业生产合作社的村庄，又作了进一步的审查，凡条件不具备的，都用说服方法劝其缓办。这样，今春全省新办了二百六十二个社。夏收后长治专区又新办了一百四十八个社。加上去年已有的，现在全省共有四百六十七个社。
    但是，山西全省农业生产合作社的发展是很不平衡的。山西共有九十个县，其中有三十三个县尚未建社，而武乡一县就有四十四个。这种情况，必须有步骤地加以改变。
    由于实行了稳健的建社方针，由于各级党委、人民政府的领导机关派遣大批干部深入各村直接进行帮助，因此，全省除左权县王家店村一个社因发生问题而中途停办外，其余的农业生产合作社都在今年的爱国增产竞赛运动中获得了显著的成绩，对整个互助合作运动发挥了极大的推动作用。但是，应当指出，某些党、政领导机关在执行上述方针时，只强调了稳健的一面，而忽视了积极的一面，他们在领导思想上还存在着某种程度上的保守倾向，这是全省农业生产合作社发展不平衡的主要原因。
    二、农业生产合作社对农村爱
    国增产竞赛运动和互助合
    作运动发生了极大的推动
    作用
    今年入春以来，山西各地都以农业生产合作社为核心，组织周围的互助组和单干农户，开展了大规模的爱国增产竞赛运动。在竞赛运动中，各个农业生产合作社都用相互检查评比的方式，向周围群众宣传了农业生产合作社的优越性。平顺的李顺达、郭玉恩、杨峰山，武乡的王锦云，黎城的石寸金，榆社的张志全，左权的董金牛，昔阳的王殿俊和太原市郊区观门前等农业生产合作社，都和周围的互助组、单干农民进行了“七查七比”（查土地性质，比是否作到因地施肥下种；查肥料的质量数量，比优良品种；查耕作好坏，比技术高低；查剩余劳力，比农业副业结合；查省工多少，比成绩大小；查政治觉悟，比爱国行动；查增产竞赛计划，比计划完成程度）。各农业生产合作社召开评比总结大会时，都邀请本村的互助组代表和村干部参加，并采用组织观摩会的方法，宣传农业生产合作社的好处。据黎城、平顺等九县极不完全的统计，参加观摩会的党员、村干部、互助组代表、劳动模范、宣传员等共达四千余人。各县还通过各种会议形式，广泛地向群众作了关于农业生产合作社的报告。武乡全县直接听到过报告的村干部和群众有二万三千多人，约占全县总人口的七分之一。
    通过检查评比和广泛宣传，农业生产合作社对于爱国增产竞赛运动和互助合作运动发生了极大的推动作用。具体表现在：
    第一、许多互助组积极要求或已开始准备办农业生产合作社。许多单干农民为了参加农业生产合作社而先参加了互助组。许多曾经怀疑农业生产合作社能否办好的人现在都不怀疑了。各地农业生产合作社周围已有四千多个村庄的党员、干部、劳动模范、先进互助组正在要求或积极准备办社。屯留西故县村的单干户在农业生产合作社的推动下，差不多都参加了互助组。许多临时互助组为了争取及早办社，已转变为常年互助组。今年上半年全省互助组的迅速发展和提高，和农业生产合作社的带头作用是分不开的。
    第二、农业生产合作社的丰产经验已为广大农民所重视。翼城许多农村干部和宣传员参观了西梁村吴春安农业生产合作社的丰产田以后，打破了保守思想，开始重视提高技术的问题。榆社大寨村周围十个村的党员干部、劳动模范、互助组代表一百七十四人，参观了张志全农业生产合作社的丰产田和小农场，不但提高了增产的信心，并且学到了许多先进经验。这类的例子是很多的。
    三、办好农业生产合作社的
    几点经验
    第一、加强党的政治思想领导，是办好农业生产合作社的关键。今年开始建社的时候，许多人还不了解农业生产合作社的性质，发生了“怕吃大锅饭”、“怕少收粮”、“怕不自由”的“三怕”思想。各级党委运用农业生产合作社的生动事例，结合高岗同志“关于农村经济发展方向”的文章，对群众进行了广泛、深入的宣传教育，集中力量解决了这些思想问题。社员入社的动机不同，觉悟程度不同，对农业生产合作社的态度也不一致。各级党的组织应该经常对社员进行政治思想教育工作。武乡县委会每月研究一次农业生产合作社工作，每两月召开一次办社干部的会议。每个县委委员专门领导几个社，负责研究和解决社员存在着的思想问题。各区区委书记都亲自掌握一两个社，创造典型经验；区委会每月召开驻村领导农业生产合作社的县、区干部会议一次，研究情况，交流经验。该县所有建立了农业生产合作社的村庄的党支部，每月都要讨论一次生产合作社的工作；并在农业生产合作社内部建立了党的小组，以党员的示范作用，团结和教育群众。因此，该县四十多个农业生产合作社的发展都是正常的、健康的。社员普遍反映：“农业生产合作社好比火车；共产党员好比火车头，带领着咱们向着幸福的社会走去。”全省大多数农业生产合作社的经验证明：在社内建立政治教员、宣传员
    （或宣传组）、读报组、俱乐部、图书馆以及“爱国检查日”制度，是党组织向社内外群众进行日常的政治思想工作的最好方法。
    第二、必须贯彻以劳力分红为主的分配政策，才能使农业生产合作社巩固地向前发展。但在执行以劳力分红为主的分配政策时，必须根据各地实际情况的不同，经过社员充分讨论，适当地确定土地和劳力的分红比例。在评工计分方面，大多数农业生产合作社是采取死分活评的办法，但也有少数社实行按件记工的制度。以上这些不同的记工办法，目前都应按照实际情况的需要允许其存在。
    第三、必须充分发扬民主，建立适当的劳动纪律，才能使农业生产合作社充分发挥集体经营的优越性。现在全省的农业生产合作社除贯彻了“入社自愿，出社自由”的原则以外，都订立了财务、会议、记工、评工、奖惩等制度。各社都规定了以社员大会为社内最高权力组织，由社员大会产生社务委员会，具体执行社员大会的决议。在劳动纪律方面，一般都根据简便易行的原则，规定了社员在劳动生产上必须服从社的统一调配，必须爱护公共财物，必须参加社内生活检讨会，有事必须请假，劳动时不得迟到早退等办法。这些民主生活的制度和劳动纪律的规定，对农业生产合作社的巩固和发展起着积极的保证作用。
    第四、农业生产合作社必须有相当长时期的生产建设计划，同时必须不断地改善劳动组织和注意培养新的技术人才。长治老解放区很多农业生产合作社在今年订立了三年或五年的生产建设计划，社员们普遍感到有了奋斗目标，生产情绪更为高涨。有些人过去怕节余劳力多了找不到出路，现在不管有多少节余劳力，都不发愁了。为了实现建设计划，必须有一套科学、合理的劳动组织和经营管理制度。在这一方面，各地农业生产合作社还没有成熟的经验，亟须创造、总结和推广成功的经验。目前各地农业生产合作社一般都已重视生产技术的改良工作，而且已经发现了一批技术能手；但大部分社对于总结、推广先进生产经验和有计划地培养技术人才还不够注意。这一点是应该提起注意的。此外，为了使农业生产合作社实现农、林、水利等方面的较大的建设计划，及时给予国家贷款的扶植和供销合作社在生产资料和农副业产品的供销方面的有力支援，也是非常必要的。
    第五、农业生产合作社在爱国增产竞赛运动中，和互助组、单干农民互相评比、互相观摩，是发现缺点改进工作的好方法。例如：阳城四区郝启盛农业生产合作社在和群众进行评比观摩时，社外群众反映：“社里土地加工不匀，好地加工多，坏地加工少；个别社员有雇佣思想。”该社即根据这个反映，展开检查讨论和互相批评，把这些问题都解决了。社的威信随之提高。
