To Chairman Mao Zedong, the Great Leader of the Chinese People Who Sincerely Assist the Korean People:

As the entire Korean people are engaged in fierce battles in the anti-aggression war to achieve the independence and unification of their homeland and eliminate the American and British armed invaders, and as we welcome the second anniversary of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army's entry into Korea to fight, we extend to you, esteemed Chairman, and through you to the fraternal Chinese people and all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the gratitude and honor of the entire nation.

The outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, led by the great Chinese Communist Party and your wise self, have established immortal feats and achievements since arriving on the Korean battlefield.

The heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fought shoulder to shoulder in close unity, frustrating and bankrupting the frenzied attacks of the American and British armed invaders, driving the enemy south of the 38th parallel, and laying a solid foundation for the final annihilation of the enemy.

The glorious feats achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the past two years since entering Korea to fight alongside the Korean People's Army in overcoming all kinds of difficulties, and the internationalist spirit displayed by the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, will forever shine in the history of our country.

Respected Chairman Mao Zedong: The historical friendship and militant solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China have been further consolidated in the struggle against our common enemy, the American and British armed invaders.

The powerful anti-American and aid-Korea movement of the 500 million people of China, the strong fortress of Asian peace, constantly and powerfully inspires the Korean people who have risen up to fight for the expulsion and annihilation of the American and British armed invaders from Korea and to defend the freedom, independence, and honor of their homeland.

The Korean people bravely overcome all trials and difficulties and are filled with the firm determination to thoroughly eliminate the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples – the American and British armed invaders – and to achieve the unification and independence of their homeland. The victories and achievements gained in the past by the soldiers and commanders of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have already shown that the united strength of the Korean and Chinese peoples can defeat the American and British armed invaders.

Without a doubt, the struggle of the Korean and Chinese peoples, with the support and solidarity of the peace-loving people of the world, led by the great Soviet people, will surely be victorious.

For the prosperity and development of the People's Republic of China, the happiness of the Chinese people, and the lasting peace and security of Asia, I wish you, esteemed Chairman, boundless longevity.

The Pyongyang City Celebration of the Second Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Entry into Korea to Fight
