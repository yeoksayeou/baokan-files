To the Editor:

Because farmers do not understand the operating procedures for mechanical farm tools and because technical safety work in various regions is insufficient, several personal injury accidents have occurred recently in Northeast China during the use of mechanical farm tools. For example, Feng Wenxing, a farmer in the Second District of Huachuan, was using a threshing machine when the wheat became damp, causing the "drum" of the threshing machine to become blocked and unable to rotate. He actually used his foot to kick the "drum," resulting in his right leg being severed by the machine below the knee. Another example is Chen Guizhi, a female trainee at the Jixian Agricultural Technology Extension Station, who put her hand into the machine's gears while it was running, resulting in two of her fingers being bitten off by the gears. Recently, I went to Kaiyuan County in Liaoxi Province and heard of similar situations. If various regions do not raise a high degree of vigilance to prevent the continued occurrence of similar situations, it will not only cause irreparable losses to farmers, but also hinder the promotion of new agricultural tools. The agencies and staff responsible for promoting mechanical farm tools should teach farmers the methods of using mechanical farm tools in detail and pay attention to conducting technical safety education for farmers on a regular basis.

    应对使用机械农具的农民进行技术保安教育
    编辑同志：由于农民不懂机械农具的操纵规程，加以各地技术保安工作做得不够，东北各地最近先后发生了使用机械农具时人身损伤事故多起。如桦川二区农民冯文兴，在使用脱粒机时，因小麦潮湿，把脱粒机上的“滚桶”塞住，不能转动，他竟用脚去蹬“滚桶”，结果右腿由膝盖下被机器绞断了。另如集贤农业技术推广站女学员陈桂芝，在机器转动时把手伸到机器牙轮中，结果叫牙轮把手指咬去了两个。最近我到辽西省开原县，也听到一些同样的情况。各地如不引起高度警惕，防止类似情形的继续发生，不但会给农民造成不可挽回的损失，而且会使新式农具推广工作受到阻碍。负责推广机械农具的机关和工作人员，应当把机械农具的使用方法详细地教给农民，并注意经常对农民进行技术保安教育。　　　　　　　　　　　　李明发
