Comrades!

The convening of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) is an event of great historical significance. Members of the Communist Party of China have shown great interest and concern for this congress. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has specially dispatched six of us as representatives to offer congratulations to the congress. (Stormy and prolonged applause) Therefore, I feel the greatest honor today to have the opportunity to personally read to the congress the message of greetings from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, signed by Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. (Stormy and prolonged applause, eventually turning into cheers) The message of greetings from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is as follows:

Respected Comrade Stalin! (Applause)

Respected delegates to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)!

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of all its members, extends its heartfelt respect and warm congratulations to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)! (Prolonged applause)

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), founded and cultivated by Lenin and Stalin, has achieved unparalleled great victories of world historical significance in long-term struggles. It led the great October Socialist Revolution, opened a new era in human history, and began the fundamental transformation from the old capitalist world to the new socialist world; it led the Soviet people to victoriously build a socialist society, creating a new social system without the exploitation of man by man; it led the Soviet people and the Soviet army to achieve victory in the Great Patriotic War, thus liberating humanity from the enslavement of German, Italian, and Japanese fascism and opening up a broad path for the cause of striving for lasting peace and people's democracy for the people of the world; it is now leading the Soviet people to fight for the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet Union, moving towards an infinitely beautiful communist society. All this is an extremely brilliant contribution to the world communist movement. All this has infinitely encouraged the working people of the world and strengthened their confidence in fighting for their own liberation and for the great future of communism.

Lenin and Stalin are the banners guiding the working people of the world forward. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a model for communist parties and workers' parties in all countries. (Prolonged applause) The Soviet Union, under the leadership of Lenin's and Stalin's Party—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—is a powerful fortress of world peace and democracy. All progressive causes in the world are inseparable from the existence and development of the Soviet Union. The people of the world look up to the Soviet Union, regarding it as their future and their hope. The oppressed nations of the East, long enslaved by imperialism, see the achievements of Soviet construction and the Soviet Union's efforts for world peace, thus increasing their courage a hundredfold in the national liberation movement. (Applause)

The Communist Party of China was established under the direct influence of the great October Revolution and taking the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as an example. Comrade Stalin's genius instructions on the Chinese revolution are of inestimable significance for the Communist Party of China in leading the Chinese people to achieve revolutionary victory. The victory of the Chinese revolution and the great achievements of the construction cause in the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China prove that correctly applying the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin according to the specific conditions of each country, and correctly applying the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in revolution and construction, is invincible. (Stormy and prolonged applause)

The convening of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) is an event of great international significance. This congress will bring great encouragement and strength to the working people of the world and all peace-loving people. I wish the congress success! I wish the Communist Party of the Soviet Union even more brilliant victories in the glorious cause of leading the Soviet people in communist construction and defending world peace!

Long live to the great and glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union! (Prolonged applause)
Long live the victory of Marxism-Leninism! (Prolonged applause)

Long live Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world! (Stormy applause, finally turning into cheers. All rise and cheer, Long live Comrade Stalin! Hurrah!)

Long live the eternal and strong friendly alliance between the people of China and the Soviet Union! (Stormy and prolonged applause, finally turning into cheers. All rise.)

    苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会的召开是一件具有伟大历史意义的事件。中国共产党的党员对于这次大会表示了极大的兴趣和关切。中国共产党的中央委员会特派我们六个人为代表向大会致贺。（暴风雨般经久不息的鼓掌）因此，我今天能有机会亲自向大会宣读由中国共产党中央委员会毛泽东主席签字的中国共产党中央委员会的祝词，使我们感到最大的荣幸。（暴风雨般经久不息的鼓掌，最后变成一片欢呼声）中国共产党中央委员会的祝词如下：敬爱的斯大林同志！（鼓掌）苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会敬爱的代表同志们！
    中国共产党中央委员会代表自己的全体党员谨向苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会致以衷心的敬意和热烈的祝贺！（经久不息的鼓掌）
    为列宁、斯大林所创立和培养出来的苏联共产党（布尔什维克）在长期斗争中取得了具有世界历史意义的无可比拟的伟大胜利。它领导了伟大的十月社会主义革命，在人类历史上开辟了新世纪，开始了从资本主义旧世界进入社会主义新世界的根本转变；它领导了苏联人民胜利地建成了社会主义社会，创造了没有人剥削人的新社会制度；它领导了苏联人民和苏联军队取得了伟大卫国战争的胜利，因而从德意日法西斯奴役下解救了人类并为全世界人民争取持久和平与人民民主的事业开辟了宽广的道路；它现在又领导苏联人民为苏联发展的第五个五年计划而奋斗，向着无限美满的共产主义社会迈进。这一切都是对于世界共产主义运动极其辉煌的贡献。这一切都无限地鼓舞了全世界劳动人民，增强了他们为争取自己解放、为共产主义的远大前途而斗争的信心。
    列宁、斯大林是引导全世界劳动人民前进的旗帜。苏联共产党是世界各国共产党和工人党的模范。（经久不息的鼓掌）在列宁、斯大林的党——苏联共产党领导下的苏联是世界和平民主的强大堡垒。世界上一切进步事业都是和苏联的存在与发展分不开的。全世界人民仰望着苏联，把苏联看作自己的将来和自己的希望。在帝国主义长期奴役下的东方被压迫民族，看见苏联建设的成就，苏联为世界和平的努力，因而百倍地加强了自己在民族解放运动中的勇气。　（鼓掌）
    中国共产党是在伟大的十月革命的直接影响下并以苏联共产党为榜样而建立起来的。斯大林同志关于中国革命的天才指示，对于中国共产党领导中国人民取得革命胜利具有无法估量的重大意义。中国革命的胜利以及中华人民共和国成立以后三年来的建设事业的巨大成就证明了：根据各个国家的具体情况，正确地运用马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说，正确地运用苏联共产党关于革命与建设的经验，是无往而不胜利的。（暴风雨般经久不息的鼓掌）
    苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会的召开是一件具有重大国际意义的事件。这次代表大会将给全世界劳动人民和一切爱好和平的人民带来伟大的鼓舞和力量。敬祝代表大会的成功！敬祝苏联共产党在领导苏联人民进行共产主义建设和保卫世界和平的光荣事业中获得更加辉煌的胜利！
    伟大的光荣的苏联共产党万岁！（经久不息的鼓掌）
    马克思列宁主义的胜利万岁！（经久不息的鼓掌）
    全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师斯大林同志万岁！（暴风雨般的鼓掌，最后变成一片欢呼声。全体起立，欢呼斯大林同志万岁，乌拉！）
    中苏两国人民的永远的强大的友好同盟万岁！（暴风雨般的经久不息的鼓掌，最后变成一片欢呼声。全体起立。）
