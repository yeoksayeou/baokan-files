Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference continued its plenary session on the evening of the 11th, listening to speeches from representatives of various countries. At the evening session, eleven representatives from nine countries spoke, including parliamentarians, musicians and poets, Catholic priests, nuclear physicists, and entrepreneurs. In their speeches, they all stated their firm determination to strive for peace, freedom, and national independence. Scientists opposing the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction also issued powerful calls at the meeting.

The executive chairmen of the evening session were: Carlo Di Pierro Bertisky (Panama), Hikmet (Turkey), Diego Montaña Cuéllar (Colombia), Stelios Iacovides (Cyprus), and Sulodo (Indonesia).

The meeting began at 8:30 PM, presided over by Executive Chairman Carlo Di Pierro Bertisky.

S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, the representative of Ceylon and a member of parliament, spoke first. He pointed out that imperialists occupied many military bases in Ceylon. The people of Ceylon demand that no country be allowed to establish or occupy military bases on Ceylonese territory; that all foreign troops withdraw from Asian countries so that the people of these countries can decide their own way of life; and that atomic energy and other modern sciences must serve the construction and benefit of mankind, rather than be used to destroy mankind. Bandaranaike particularly appealed to the youth of all countries not to kill each other. He emphasized that in Asia, the national liberation struggle against imperialism is the struggle for peace. The united strength of the people of Asian countries will bring liberation and lasting peace to mankind. His speech was warmly welcomed.

The Indian representative, the famous Bengali novelist, Manoj Basu, addressed the conference with congratulations. He said: Weapons can kill people, but they cannot kill the hearts of the people. Our literature will awaken joy and love for humanity in the hearts of the people. Ordinary men and women demand to live peaceful lives. But a handful of warmongers are plotting to use them as cannon fodder. Let the literature of the new era tear off the enemy's mask. Let the enemy be isolated, lose strength, and be hated by all people. Let the people of all countries build a society based on friendship through mutual understanding.

The American representative, Joan Hinton, a former research fellow at the Institute for Nuclear Studies at the University of Chicago, walked onto the stage amidst warm applause and delivered a statement to the Japanese delegation (full text to be issued separately). In the name of a scientist who had worked at an atomic bomb test site, she appealed to scientists in the United States and Japan: Let us work harder to ban atomic bombs, bacteriological warfare, and all weapons of mass destruction. Her statement was warmly welcomed by the audience, and all the representatives stood up to express their respect to her.

Then, eight American representatives walked onto the stage amidst music and stormy applause to present flowers and flags to the Japanese representatives. When the American representatives presented the green peace flag painted with a dove of peace to the Japanese representatives, the applause became even more enthusiastic. The representatives of the American and Japanese people warmly shook hands and paid their respects amidst the enthusiastic applause of peace fighters from Asian and Pacific countries.

The Pakistani representative, Hanif, said in his speech: American imperialism is establishing military bases in many countries. The revival of Japanese militarism has shocked peace-loving people all over the world. They are committing heinous crimes in Korea. Although Korea is far from us, we can hear the cries of the Korean people. Their pain is our pain. We congratulate them on their victory, and we have an indelible love for them.

The Israeli representative, Nina Fienhaus, addressed the audience, extending greetings on behalf of the Jews and Arabs of Israel. She said that the fundamental problem in the Near East and Middle East countries is the attempt by American and British imperialism to turn these countries into military bases for attacking the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. But the people of Israel will never fight against the Soviet Union. Last month, a street rally and demonstration against extending the term of military service, and protests by soldiers in Israel, showed that the people of Israel want peace and oppose war. Fienhaus pointed out that under the instruction of Washington, the Israeli government has participated in the arms race, and military spending in the 1952-1953 national budget accounts for 45 percent. The government has also implemented a policy of national discrimination and oppression against the Arab minority. Due to the arms race, people's lives are mired in poverty. Fienhaus emphasized that the masses of the people have increasingly seen the true purpose of the government's policies, so they demand an end to the interference of imperialists in Israel and neighboring Arab countries, and demand a stop to the arms race. Israel will never become a base for the United States against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. As long as the people of the Near East and Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region, and the whole world work together, they will surely achieve world peace.

The Ecuadorian representative, Professor Juan Morales Eloy, a Catholic priest and member of the World Peace Council, spoke in his capacity as a Catholic priest. He praised the achievements of New China, saying that heroic workers, students, and peasants, and excellent women, under the wise government of Mao Zedong, have transformed their country into a vast field of production. Professor Eloy said: We firmly believe that Catholics all over the world will understand the sincerity of this great peace movement and will help achieve its goals. It is inconceivable that a church worker, a priest, would distort the truth, or lag behind in the struggle to realize the legitimate hopes of the people. Professor Eloy said: The Christian Bible says, "Love your neighbor as yourself," and the classics of Eastern religions go even further, saying, "Love your neighbor more than yourself." The common maxims of Jews, Christians, Catholics, Buddhists, Muslims, Brahmins, Taoists, and other religious people all over the world are: Love your neighbor, love peace. We all demand peace for all mankind. When Eloy finished speaking, the audience applauded enthusiastically, and many representatives shook hands with him to congratulate him.

The Canadian representative, Elgin Nish, a fisheries operator, spoke in favor of the people of the Pacific region maintaining friendly economic relations and free trade. Through trade, a path to friendship and peace will be found. Elgin Nish denounced the "Tripartite Fisheries Treaty" signed by the United States, Canada, and Japan after the infamous Treaty of San Francisco was concluded. He said that because of this treaty, Canada and Japan were forced to give up the rights of their nationals to fish in certain high seas in the North Pacific along the coast of Alaska. It is hard to imagine any independent country signing such a "treaty," but Japan signed it, and Canada has also indicated its willingness to do so, despite angry protests from the fishing industry. Elgin Nish finally said: Peace means life and profession. Let us join hands to defend peace and bring an era of lasting happiness and prosperity to the people of all countries.

The meeting was then presided over by Executive Chairman Stelios Iacovides.

The Japanese representative, Hideo Sakurai, the chairman of Ba Shoji Co., Ltd., spoke on the issue of economic exchanges. He pointed out that the characteristics of the Japanese economy are: Japan relies on overseas for about 20 percent of its food, and many raw materials. Since the end of 1948, the United States has begun to use Japan's economic weaknesses, turning Japan's industries into its arsenals, and打击和平工业 (not translated). After launching the war of aggression against Korea, the United States forced Japan to ban trade with the Soviet Union and New China, forcing Japan to buy food and raw materials from the United States at extremely high prices. As a result, imports increased, production costs increased, prices rose, and unemployment increased, making Japanese industry further dependent on US military orders and engaged in military production. Sakurai said: However, now the Japanese people have realized that restoring trade with China and the Soviet Union and conducting free economic exchanges with all countries are inseparable from the struggle for peace. He then described how the Japanese people organized the Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Trade Promotion Conferences, the preparatory committee of the Japan International Trade Promotion Committee, and prepared to conduct free economic exchanges with various countries and received widespread support from domestic public opinion. He said that after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement in June this year, the joy of the Japanese people over Sino-Japanese trade has risen. Sakurai finally said: For Japan, if it wants to move towards the road of peace, it must immediately abolish the one-sided Treaty of San Francisco and seek liberation from the economic oppression of the United States. Without this, Japan's peace is absolutely unimaginable.

The Pakistani representative, Mujibur Rahman, first congratulated the Chinese people on their efforts in opposing war and defending peace. He said that the Chinese people and their government, due to their great progress and amazing development on various fronts, have become a beacon for the oppressed nations of the world, especially in Asia. Rahman said that in order to continue to maintain its rule and exploitation, imperialism does not hesitate to threaten the people with war. They are terrified of the awakening of the people of Asian countries and their movements, and have begun to carry out frenzied war preparations everywhere. Rahman described the situation of imperialism and reactionaries undermining and suppressing the people's movements in the Asian and Pacific regions, and the reactionary aggressors creating discord between people, in order to prolong their oppression and rule. Rahman said: The problems of the general people in the Asian and Pacific regions are the same. They demand to survive and also allow others to survive. They have no hatred for anyone, nor are they jealous of others. Only exploiters use differences in religion, belief, and thought to create divisions to divide the people. Rahman denounced US imperialism for disregarding human life and property in Korea, delaying the armistice negotiations, and continuing the war. He said: The American imperialists could not cope with the resistance of the people and even used bacteriological weapons and chemical weapons. I really cannot condemn this crime in words. But I dare to assert that this crime will soon be judged by the public opinion of the people of the world. His speech ended in warm applause.

The Iraqi representative, the poet Samawi, first described the arduous struggle of the people of Iraq, a country with a long civilization, for liberation and peace. He said that in Iraq, the so-called freedom is only the freedom of feudal rule enjoyed by the slaves of the colonialists. Trade union organizations are banned, and newspapers are banned. There is no freedom of assembly, association, or strike. Prisons are filled with peace fighters, and the streets are filled with secret agents. Terror rules the entire country. The bodies of martyrs, the gallows of Baghdad, the chains in prisons, all of this proves the Iraqi people's will to demand independence and peace. Samawi said: Even so, the struggle continues. Even so, I am speaking today on the land of China. The great struggle of the Chinese people makes us believe that a free and happy life is possible. Because of our admiration for the Chinese people, I lower my voice. We are gathering under the Chinese sky with a tradition of benevolence, on the Chinese land sprinkled with the blood of patriots. Our purpose is to build a wall so that the people of all countries can defend against the terror of the war prepared by American imperialism. The victory of the Korean people in the struggle against the successors of Nazism has aroused the admiration and respect of all mankind and prompted the oppressed nations to establish the will to dig the grave of imperialism. The sun of freedom will eventually shine on this region of the world—the entire Asia-Pacific region. Iraq is united with all countries, and everyone is moving forward on the road of peace and freedom. Samawi's passionate speech was warmly welcomed.

The Ceylonese representative, Chang Hikkaduwaveik, chairman of the All Ceylon Dockworkers' Union, continued to speak. He said: The American imperialists committed the crime of using bacteriological weapons. This crime is much greater than the crimes of the Nazi war criminals who were tried in Nuremberg in 1946. Justice and democracy demand that those who are responsible for crimes against humanity must be punished.

Then, all the representatives of the Chilean delegation stepped onto the stage amidst music to present gifts to the conference. Maria Canepa, a Chilean female representative, recited with passion a long poem dedicated to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference by the Chilean female poet Gabriela Mistral. When she recited: Let us defend the future of today and tomorrow! Let every man and woman become a loyal son and daughter of peace, loyal to our sacred mother. A storm of applause erupted in the audience. Then, the Chilean representatives presented a silk Chilean flag to the conference, expressing the sincere support of the Chilean people for the conference. At this time, the joyful applause continued for a long time.

Finally, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Conference, Hai (Pakistan), announced that the conference had received 821 congratulatory telegrams and 23,274 congratulatory letters from the vast number of people of all walks of life in various parts of China. In these telegrams and letters, they all expressed their determination to work hard to strengthen the patriotic production increase and economy campaign and to strengthen learning to defend peace. Letters and telegrams from various places continued to fly in like snowflakes. The representatives of the conference warmly applauded the firm determination of the Chinese people to defend peace. Hai also read letters from hundreds of American prisoners of war and many British prisoners of war in Korea to the conference. All the representatives were deeply moved by the sincere desire for peace of these prisoners of war.

The evening meeting was adjourned at this point.

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第十日晚间会议情况
    【新华社十一日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在十一日晚间继续举行全体会议，听取各国代表发言。在晚间会议上发言的有九个国家的十一位代表，他们中间有议员、音乐家和诗人、天主教神父、原子核物理学家和企业家。他们在发言中都申述了争取和平、自由与民族独立的坚强决心。反对制造大规模杀人武器的科学家也在会上发出了有力的呼声。
    晚间会议的执行主席是：卡罗·第·皮尔奥·柏特里斯基（巴拿马），希克梅特（土耳其），迪埃哥·蒙塔尼亚·库艾拉（哥伦比亚），斯第里安诺斯·杰柯维德斯（塞浦路斯），苏洛多（印度尼西亚）。
    会议在下午八时三十分开始，由执行主席卡罗·第·皮尔奥·柏特里斯基主持。
    锡兰代表、国会议员萨·迪·般达拉纳克首先发言。他指出帝国主义者在锡兰占据了许多军事基地。锡兰人民要求不许任何国家在锡兰国土上建立或占据军事基地；要求一切外国军队撤离亚洲各国，以便这些国家的人民决定他们自己的生活方式；要求原子能和其他现代科学必须为人类的建设和利益服务，而不用来毁灭人类。般达拉纳克特别呼吁一切国家的青年不要互相残杀。他强调说：在亚洲，反对帝国主义的民族解放斗争就是争取和平的斗争。亚洲各国人民的力量团结起来，就会给人类带来解放和持久和平。他的发言受到热烈欢迎。
    印度代表、著名孟加拉文小说家蒙诺志·鲍斯向大会致祝词。他说：武器可以杀死人，可是不能杀死人民的心。我们的文学将会在人民的心中唤起喜悦和对人类的爱。普通的男女都要求过和平的生活。但一小撮战争贩子却阴谋把他们当作炮灰。让新时代的文学撕下敌人的面具吧。让敌人被孤立起来，失去力量并被一切人们所憎恨吧。让各国人民通过相互了解来建设一个以友爱为基础的社会。
    美国代表、前芝加哥大学原子核研究院物理学研究员琼·辛顿在热烈掌声中走上主席台，发表了向日本代表团的声明（全文另发）。她以一个曾经在原子弹实验场工作过的科学家的名义，向美国和日本的科学家呼吁：让我们更加努力争取禁止原子弹、细菌战争和一切大规模杀人武器。她的声明受到全场的热烈欢迎，全体代表起立向她表示敬意。
    接着，八个美国代表在音乐声和暴风雨般的掌声中，走上主席台向日本代表献花献旗，当美国代表把绘有和平鸽的绿色和平旗帜送给日本代表时，全场掌声更趋热烈，美国人民和日本人民的代表在亚洲及太平洋各国和平战士的热烈掌声中亲切地紧紧握手致意。
    巴基斯坦代表哈尼夫在发言中说：美国帝国主义正在许多国家建立军事基地。复活日本军国主义已经使得全世界爱好和平的人民震惊。他们正在朝鲜制造滔天的罪恶。虽然朝鲜离我们很远，但我们听得见朝鲜人民的呼喊。他们的痛苦就是我们的痛苦。我们祝贺他们的胜利，我们对他们抱着不可磨灭的热爱。
    以色列代表妮娜·斐安豪斯发言时代表以色列的犹太人和阿拉伯人向全体代表致敬。她说近东和中东国家的基本问题就是美、英帝国主义企图把这些国家变成进攻苏联和人民民主国家的军事基地。但是以色列人民永远不会同苏联作战。上个月以色列有一个反对延长兵役年限的街道集会和示威游行，及兵士的抗议运动，表明了以色列人民是希望和平反对战争的。斐安豪斯指出：在华盛顿的授意之下，以色列政府参加了军备竞赛，一九五二年至一九五三年国家预算中的军备费占百分之四十五。政府又实行反对少数民族阿拉伯人的民族歧视和压迫政策。由于军备竞赛，人民生活陷于困苦境地。斐安豪斯强调说：人民群众已日益看清政府政策的真正目的，所以要求结束帝国主义者对以色列与邻近阿拉伯国家的干涉，要求停止军备竞赛。以色列决不会成为美国反对苏联和人民民主国家的基地，只要近东和中东、亚洲太平洋区域及全世界人民同心协力，一定能取得世界和平。
        厄瓜多尔代表、天主教神父、世界和平理事会理事胡安·摩拉雷斯·埃洛伊教授以天主教神父的身份发言。他盛赞新中国的成就，他说雄赳赳的工人、学生和农民，优秀的妇女已在毛泽东贤明政府的领导下把他们的国家变成了广大的生产园地。埃洛伊教授说：我们深信全世界的天主教会人士必定会了解这次伟大和平运动的真诚，必定会帮助实现它的目标。不能想像一个教会工作人员，一个神父会歪曲真理，会在争取实现人民的正当希望的斗争中落于人后。埃洛伊教授说：基督教的圣经说：“爱你的邻人像爱你自己一样”，东方宗教的经典更进一步说：“爱你的邻人甚于爱你自己”。全世界的犹太教徒、基督教徒、天主教徒、佛教徒、伊斯兰教徒、婆罗门教徒、道教徒以及其他教徒的共同的箴言是：爱你的邻居，爱和平。我们大家都要求全世界人类的和平。埃洛伊发言结束时，全场掌声热烈，许多代表并和他握手致贺。
    加拿大代表、渔业经营者艾尔金·尼什发言主张太平洋区域各国人民应当保持友好的经济关系和自由贸易。通过贸易将会找到通向友好与和平的道路。艾尔金·尼什痛斥美国、加拿大、日本在臭名远扬的旧金山条约成立后即签订的“三国渔业条约”。他说由于这个条约，加拿大和日本就被迫放弃它们的国民在阿拉斯加沿岸北太平洋某些公海中捕鱼的权利。很难想像任何独立的国家会在这样一个“条约”上签字，可是日本签了字，而加拿大也表示准备这样做，尽管渔业界纷纷提出了愤怒的抗议。艾尔金·尼什最后说：和平意味着生命和职业。让我们携起手来保卫和平，为所有国家的人民带来永久的幸福和繁荣的时代。
    会议至此由执行主席斯第里安诺斯·杰柯维德斯主持。
    日本代表、巴商事株式会社董事长樱井英雄作了关于经济交流问题的发言。他指出日本经济的特点是：日本约有百分之二十的粮食，和许多原料要仰给于海外。自一九四八年年底以来，美国就开始利用日本经济的弱点，把日本的产业变为它的兵工厂，打击和平工业。美国在发动了侵略朝鲜的战争之后，又强迫日本禁止对苏联和新中国的贸易，使日本不得不以极高的代价向美国购买粮食和原料。结果引起入超增加，生产成本提高，物价上涨，失业人数增加，使日本工业进一步依赖美国的军事订货，从事军需生产。樱井英雄说：但是，现在日本人民已经认识到恢复对中、苏的贸易以及对一切国家进行自由的经济交流，是与争取和平分不开的。他接着叙述了日本人民组织日中和日苏贸易促进会议、日本国际贸易促进委员会筹备委员会，准备和各国进行自由经济交流并受到国内舆论普遍支持的情形，他说今年六月，日中贸易协议缔结以后，日本人民对中日贸易的喜悦情绪已高涨起来。樱井英雄最后说：对日本来说，如果要向和平大道前进，就必须立刻废除旧金山的片面和约，从美国的经济压迫下求得解放。不是这样，日本的和平是绝对不可想像的。
    巴基斯坦代表穆其布尔·拉赫曼发言时首先对中国人民在反对战争保卫和平中的努力表示祝贺，他说中国人民和他们的政府由于在各种战线上的巨大进步和惊人发展，已成为世界上特别是亚洲被压迫民族的灯塔。拉赫曼说，帝国主义为了继续维持它的统治和剥削，不惜以战争威胁人民。它们对亚洲各国人民的觉醒和他们的运动感到惊恐，已开始在各处进行疯狂的战争准备。拉赫曼叙述了帝国主义和反动派破坏及镇压亚洲及太平洋区域的人民运动的情形，和反动侵略者制造人与人之间的不和，借以延长他们的压迫与统治的情形。拉赫曼说：亚洲及太平洋区域一般人民的问题都是同一的。他们要求生存，同时也让别人能够生存，他们对任何人都没有仇恨，也不妒嫉别人。只有剥削者才利用宗教、信仰、思想的不同制造分歧来分裂人民。拉赫曼痛斥美帝国主义在朝鲜不顾人类的生命财产，拖延停战谈判，继续战争。他说：美帝国主义者应付不了人民的抵抗，竟然使用细菌武器和化学武器，我实在无法用言语来谴责这种罪行。但是我敢断定：这种罪行不久必然要在世界人民的公意面前受到审判。他的演说在热烈的掌声中结束。
    伊拉克代表、诗人萨马威发言时首先叙述文明悠久的伊拉克人民正在为了解放与和平作着艰苦的斗争。他说在伊拉克，所谓自由只是殖民者的奴才们才有的封建统治自由。工会组织被禁止了，报纸被取缔了。没有集会、结社、罢工的自由。监狱里禁闭着和平战士，街道上充塞着特务，恐怖统治着整个国家。烈士们的尸首、巴格达的绞台、监狱里的锁链，这一切证明伊拉克人民要求独立与和平的意志。萨马威说：虽然如此，斗争却继续进行着。虽然如此，我今日却在中国的土地上讲话。中国人民的巨大斗争使我们相信一种自由和幸福的生活是可能的。由于对中国人民的敬佩，我放低我的声音。我们在有着仁爱的传统的中国的天空之下，在洒过爱国者的鲜血的中国土地上集会。我们的目的是修筑一座城墙，使各国人民可以防卫美帝国主义所准备的战争的恐怖。朝鲜人民在反对纳粹主义继承者的斗争中的胜利，引起全人类的钦仰与尊重，并促使被压迫民族树立挖掘帝国主义坟墓的意志。自由的太阳终将照耀在世界的这个地区上——整个亚洲与太平洋区域。伊拉克和所有国家结合在一起，大家在和平与自由的大道上向前迈进。萨马威的热情洋溢的讲演，受到热烈的欢迎。
    锡兰代表、全锡兰码头工人工会主席昌·希卡杜维克接着发言。他说：美帝国主义者犯了使用细菌武器的罪行。这种罪行比那些一九四六年在纽伦堡受审判的纳粹战犯的罪行还要大得多。正义与民主要求，那些对于违反人道的罪行负有责任的人，必须受到惩罚。
    接着，智利代表团全体代表在音乐声中步上主席台向大会献礼。智利女代表马丽亚·伽奈巴热情横溢地朗诵了智利女诗人加勃里埃拉·米斯特拉尔献给亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的长诗。当她朗诵到：让我们保卫今日和明天的未来吧！让每一个男人和女人，变成和平的忠实儿女，忠实于我们神圣的母亲。全场激起了暴风雨般的掌声。接着，智利代表把丝质的智利国旗一面献给大会，表示智利人民对大会的热诚拥护。这时，欢愉的掌声历久不息。
    最后，大会副秘书长哈伊（巴基斯坦）宣布大会收到中国各地各阶层广大人民发来的八百二十一封贺电和两万三千二百七十四封贺信。在这些电报和信件中，他们都表示要努力加强爱国增产节约运动、加强学习以保卫和平的坚强意志。各地的函电还像雪片一样从各地继续飞来。大会代表们为中国人民保卫和平的坚定决心热烈鼓掌。哈伊又宣读了在朝鲜的几百个美国战俘和许多英国战俘给大会的信。全体代表为这些战俘们要求和平的真挚愿望深深感动。
    晚间会议至此休会。
