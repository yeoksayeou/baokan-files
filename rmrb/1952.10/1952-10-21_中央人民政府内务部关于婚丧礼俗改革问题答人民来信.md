    For over a year, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government has received letters from Mr. Yu Zishan, Jin Daifu, Ji Xinyou, Sun Xiangzhi, Li Houren, Tong Mingyi, Liu Guoyi, Yang Gennan, Fan Guangsheng, and others, suggesting reforms to wedding and funeral customs. The issues raised in these letters can be summarized into the following two points.

    I. Suggestions that the government enact laws to universally implement cremation. The reasons given are: (1) Past burials occupied a lot of good farmland; (2) Coffins and other funeral items cost a lot; (3) Burial is unhygienic, especially for those who die from infectious diseases, as burying them in the ground may spread the disease to the living. Therefore, it should be stipulated that cremation be implemented uniformly in the future. Cremation is both economical and hygienic, does not hinder descendants' remembrance of their ancestors, can expand arable land, and can break superstitions.

    II. Old "wedding" rituals still prevail in vast rural areas and even exist in many cities. These rituals are very wasteful. Many people cannot afford the dowry, so they cannot get married even after being engaged; others go into debt or even bankruptcy because of weddings. Therefore, the government should formulate unified new "wedding and funeral rites" to eradicate these extravagant and wasteful feudal rituals.

    Our response to the above suggestions is as follows:

    I. Regarding the issue of burial of corpses. Burial indeed has many disadvantages, and cremation indeed has many advantages. However, it is not appropriate for the government to enact laws to promote cremation at present. Because: The vast rural areas have "different customs every ten miles," making it difficult to unify customs through laws. The superstitious ideas that people have due to long-term feudal rule cannot be solved by the government issuing a law. In particular, our country is a multi-ethnic country, and each ethnic group has its own customs and habits; the maintenance and reform of the customs and habits of various ethnic groups are determined by themselves, as stipulated clearly in Article 53 of the Common Program. For the above reasons, the government cannot stipulate that cremation be implemented uniformly at present, but should, based on the different conditions of each region, promote and publicize it through the government, raise the awareness of the masses, and let the masses take the initiative to reform.

    Cremation should first be promoted in large and medium-sized cities. Because cities have a large population and little land, objective conditions limit the development of burial; urban people are better educated and more likely to accept cremation. Cities like Shanghai and Beijing already have cremation facilities, and many people have already practiced cremation. In order to promote cremation, we suggest that social welfare organizations and individuals running funeral homes in various cities should have cremation equipment and provide as much convenience as possible to the masses who hold cremations.

    II. Regarding the issue of wedding ceremonies. Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, open buying and selling of marriages has been prohibited, but many parents still take advantage of old customs and habits to engage in buying and selling marriages in disguise, making ideas on exchanging gifts when their children are engaged or married, interfering with freedom of marriage. Therefore, old wedding ceremonies are not only extravagant and wasteful, but also become breeding grounds for buying and selling marriages and obstacles to the freedom of marriage for men and women. It is necessary to reform them. Over the past three years, young men and women in many regions have created solemn, novel, and economical wedding ceremonies—collective weddings—in the struggle to win freedom of marriage. This type of ceremony is very popular with the masses and has spread from cities to rural areas, gradually becoming popular in vast rural areas. In order to promote this new type of wedding ceremony, we suggest that local democratic women's federations, civil affairs departments, and other social welfare organizations provide assistance and guidance, and we also hope that local newspapers and other publications will introduce some experiences.

    In short, it is not appropriate to stipulate rigid "unified wedding and funeral rites" for the reform of wedding and funeral customs at present. Instead, under the general principle of increasing production and practicing economy, the people should be educated (not forced by orders) to be simple and unpretentious in handling wedding and funeral matters. Local people's governments and people's organizations should consciously support new ceremonies and promote new customs.

### 中央人民政府内务部关于婚丧礼俗改革问题答人民来信

    中央人民政府内务部关于婚丧礼俗改革问题答人民来信
    一年多以来，中央人民政府内务部先后接到郁子善、金大夫、季莘囿、孙相志、李厚仁、佟明义、刘国义、杨根南、范广生等先生建议改革婚丧礼俗的来信。信中提出的问题，归纳起来有以下两个。
    一、建议政府定出法令，普遍实行火葬。理由是：（一）过去的土葬占了许多良田；（二）棺木和其他送葬品花费很大；（三）土葬有碍卫生，特别是患传染病死了的人，埋在土里也可能向外传染给活人。因此应规定今后一律实行火葬。火葬既经济，又合乎卫生，也无碍后嗣对先人的纪念，还可以扩大耕地面积和破除迷信。
    二、旧的“娶亲”仪式，仍流行于广大农村，甚至在不少城市也存在。这种仪式浪费很大。不少人因赔不起妆奁，订了婚不能结婚；也有人因结婚而负债，甚至破产。因此政府应制定统一的新的“婚丧礼制”，铲除这种铺张浪费的封建仪式。
    对于上述建议，我们的答复如下：
    一、关于尸体葬埋问题。土葬确有许多害处，火葬确有很多好处。但目前由政府规定法令推行火葬是不妥当的。因为：广大的农村“十里不同俗”，很难把习俗用法令统一起来。长期的封建统治所给予人们的迷信观念，也绝不是政府颁布一个法令就可以解决了的。特别是我们国家是一个多民族的国家，各个民族都有自己的风俗习惯；各民族的风俗习惯的保持和改革，决定于他们自己，这在共同纲领第五十三条中规定得很明白。由于以上理由，目前政府不可能规定一律实行火葬，而应根据各地不同情况，经过政府提倡宣传，提高群众的觉悟，由群众自己主动地去改革。
    火葬目前以先在大中城市中提倡为好。因为城市人多地少，客观条件限制了土葬的发展；城市人民文化程度较高，也易于接受火葬办法。上海、北京等城市已有火葬设备，不少人也已实行火葬。为了提倡火葬，我们建议各城市举办殡仪馆的社会公益团体和个人，应有火葬器设备，并给予举行火葬的群众以可能的方便。
    二、关于结婚仪式问题。自婚姻法颁布后，公开的买卖婚姻是被禁止了，但仍有不少做父母的，他们借着旧的风俗习惯，变相地进行买卖婚姻，在儿女订婚、结婚互送礼物上打主意，干涉婚姻自由。因之，旧的结婚仪式不仅是铺张浪费，而且成了买卖婚姻的温床，男女婚姻自由的障碍。加以改革是必要的。三年来，许多地区的男女青年在争取婚姻自由的斗争中，已创造了隆重、新颖而且经济的结婚仪式——集体结婚。这种仪式很受群众欢迎，并已由城市发展到农村，在广大农村中逐渐流行起来。为了提倡这种新的结婚仪式，我们建议各地民主妇女联合会和民政部门以及其他社会公益团体予以协助、指导，也希望各地报纸和其他刊物介绍一些经验。
    总之，目前婚丧礼俗的改革，尚不宜规定硬性的“统一的婚丧礼制”，而应该是在增产节约的总原则下，教育人民（不是强迫命令）在处理婚丧事情上要简单朴素，各地人民政府和人民团体应有意识地支持新的仪式，提倡新的风尚。
