Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th TASS: The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) continued its sessions on October 8th. The morning session of the Congress was chaired by Andrianov.

    He permitted Aristov to propose a motion regarding the report of the Central Auditing Commission of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Aristov proposed approving the report of the Central Auditing Commission of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The Congress unanimously approved this motion.
    After passing the resolution on the report of the Central Auditing Commission, the Congress proceeded to discuss the third item on the agenda: "Directives of the 19th Party Congress on the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the USSR for 1951-1955 (Fifth Five-Year Plan)." Comrade M. Z. Saburov, Chairman of the State Planning Committee, delivered the report.
    At the beginning of his report, Saburov emphasized that the Fifth Five-Year Plan continues the line of the previous Stalin Five-Year Plans of peaceful development of the Soviet economy, planned expansion of the socialist economy, and improvement of the people's welfare. The implementation of the Fifth Five-Year Plan will be an important stage in the gradual transition of the Soviet Union from socialism to communism.
    Saburov said that due to the completion of the previous, i.e., the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the level of pre-war development of the Soviet national economy has been greatly surpassed. Its successful completion made the adoption of the Fifth Five-Year Plan possible. The Fifth Five-Year Plan will ensure the further development of all sectors of the national economy and the improvement of the people's cultural and living standards.
    He then listed the main indices of the new Five-Year Plan. Many of the figures listed in the report reflect the Soviet people's continuous and accelerated advance towards communism.
    The new Five-Year Plan stipulates an increase of approximately seventy percent in industrial output within five years. This means that in 1955, the total industrial output will be three times the pre-war level. The average annual rate of industrial development will be approximately twelve percent.
    Our socialist industry will not only increase in quantity but also improve in quality. Laborious operations will be fully mechanized, production will be widely automated, and the energy resources of the national economy will be increased. The completion of one of the great communist construction projects on the Volga River—the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station—and other large power plants will play an important role in this work.
    Agriculture also has equally bright prospects. The level of mechanization of agriculture will be further improved, the efficiency of cultivation will be further increased, and the yield per unit area will also increase. Protective forest belts will be planted on five million hectares, 35,000 ponds and reservoirs will be built, and the area of irrigated land will be expanded by thirty to thirty-five percent.
    Rail, sea, river, air, and automobile transport, as well as communication tools, will be developed on a large scale.
    Based on the development of the national economy, the material and cultural standards of the people will be greatly improved. The national income of the Soviet Union will increase by at least sixty percent during the five-year period.
    The plan stipulates that the total amount of capital construction will increase by about ninety percent compared to the Fourth Five-Year Plan.
    Saburov emphasized that the new plan clearly reflects the necessary conditions of the basic economic law of socialism: guaranteeing the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by means of continuously developing and improving socialist production on the basis of the highest technology.
    He then pointed out that the Party organizations, during the discussion of the draft directives of the Five-Year Plan, put forward many suggestions and supplements. All these suggestions and supplements are filled with concern for the overall development of the country. This document has been warmly welcomed by the Soviet people and the working people of the people's democracies, who see in it their future and a powerful factor in strengthening the cause of world peace.
    Comrade Saburov concluded his report by saying that the Soviet people will spare no effort to ensure the victorious completion and overfulfillment of this Five-Year Plan. The Soviet people, closely united around the Communist Party and around their beloved leader and teacher Comrade Stalin, are advancing towards communism with full confidence. The audience responded to his words with stormy applause.
    After a short recess, the Congress began discussing Saburov's report.
    Aristov (Chelyabinsk) spoke first, emphasizing that the 19th Party Congress has very significant meaning for building communism on Soviet soil and for the international communist movement. This Congress will greatly strengthen the power of our Party and will further enhance the prestige of the Soviet Union among the working people of the world.
    Aristov pointed out that the speed of further development of the Soviet Union stipulated in the new Five-Year Plan is very high, but undoubtedly completely feasible.
    In the years since the 18th Party Congress, the main industry of the Chelyabinsk Oblast—the steel industry—has grown, and it now produces more metal than the entire metal output of Tsarist Russia. The factories in this oblast are very likely to greatly exceed the prescribed production targets.
    Aristov suggested stipulating the acceleration of mining and extracting mineral resources. He pointed out the backwardness in the design of industrial enterprises and emphasized the need to expand the connection between science and production and increase the number of scientific research institutions in the Chelyabinsk Oblast.
    Aristov emphasized that the grain of the Chelyabinsk Oblast is completely self-sufficient. He proposed studying the issue of early sowing to ensure increased yields.
    He continued by saying that in the post-war years, the Urals have become one of the largest bases of the national economy and a major supplier of metal, machinery, and equipment needed for the great communist construction projects. The strength of the Soviet Urals comes from the people, who are infinitely loyal to their homeland, to their own Party, and to the great Stalin—the creator of the second center of coal and metallurgy in the East.
    Minister of the Petroleum Industry Baibakov spoke next, talking about the major changes that have taken place in the oil extraction and refining industry from the 18th Congress to the 19th Congress. The government has taken measures to rapidly restore the oil industry in the areas ravaged by the German fascist invaders and to massively develop the oil extraction industry in new areas. Under the direction of Comrade Stalin, a new oil-producing center—the Second Baku—was established between the Volga and the Urals. Significant changes have also occurred in other oil-producing regions.
    In terms of already explored oil resources, the Soviet Union is now among the countries with the richest oil reserves in the world, which makes it possible for us to greatly increase the speed of work and complete Comrade Stalin's directive on increasing the annual oil production to 60 million tons ahead of schedule.
    The state has established a new gas industry. Huge gas pipelines and gas factories have been established. Explored natural gas resources make it possible to supply many cities with gas and also to develop gas chemical engineering.
    The draft directives of the Congress prescribe particularly important tasks for oil workers. The draft directives stipulate an increase in oil production of eighty-five percent. Baibakov said that this means that oil workers must complete major tasks on a huge scale.
    Baibakov believes that the draft directives of the Congress emphasize the need to further increase oil production in the eastern states of the country, the need to greatly increase the amount of drilling, and the widespread adoption of new methods for extracting oil.
    In conclusion, Baibakov said that, without a doubt, under the leadership of our glorious Party, Soviet oil workers will certainly be able to complete the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan regarding the extraction and refining of oil and gas ahead of schedule.
    Near the end of the morning session, representatives of many foreign communist parties delivered congratulatory speeches. The delegates to the Congress welcomed these guests, representing the working people of various countries, with warm applause. The speeches by the leaders of the international communist movement profoundly expressed friendship and solidarity in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.
    The participants warmly welcomed Liu Shaoqi, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, who conveyed the friendly congratulations of the Chinese Communist Party and the entire great Chinese people to the delegates. Amidst stormy applause, he read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, signed by Chairman Mao Zedong (the congratulatory message is issued separately). His words were met with sustained applause from the delegates.
    Klement Gottwald, Chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, received a warm welcome. At the beginning of his speech, he conveyed the congratulations of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and all working people to the Congress. He said: The news of the convening of the 19th Congress and the publication of the Congress's historic documents have received a very broad response in his country. Hundreds of thousands of working people in the cities and countryside of Czechoslovakia have undertaken socialist tasks to greet the Congress and are victoriously completing these tasks. Gottwald said that the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has always learned from the Bolsheviks how to fight and how to win. Comrade Stalin's new and important work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is an inexhaustible source of experience for the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in its daily struggle to build and strengthen the socialist system and in its work to maintain peace.
    On behalf of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the entire country, Gottwald expressed heartfelt thanks to the Soviet working people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), and Comrade Stalin himself for the invaluable assistance that the people of Czechoslovakia have received from the Soviet Union.
    Gottwald's speech was repeatedly interrupted by prolonged applause from the delegates.
    Then, Longo, Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, spoke and was warmly welcomed by the delegates.
    On behalf of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party and Togliatti himself, he conveyed the fraternal greetings and congratulations of the 2.5 million members of the Italian Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, as well as workers, peasants, other working people, and democrats, to the delegates, the Bolshevik Party, and its great leader Comrade Stalin.
    Longo said, our salute to you, to your Congress and to Comrade Stalin, is a salute to the saviors who rescued Europe and the whole world from Fascist oppression, is a salute to the builders of the new communist society, who point out to mankind the road to liberation and progress, is a salute to the protectors of international peace and friendship!
    Longo pointed out: The great victory of communism brings joy to the working people of Italy and inspires their struggle. These victories contribute to the maintenance of world peace and contribute to the strengthening of international friendly relations. Longo's speech was repeatedly interrupted by sustained applause.
    The morning session adjourned at this point.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th TASS: The afternoon session of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on October 8th continued the discussion of the report by M. Z. Saburov on the "Directives of the 19th Party Congress on the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the USSR for 1951-1955 (Fifth Five-Year Plan)".
    Niyazov, the chairman of this session, allowed Babayev, the representative of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, to speak. Babayev said: Like all the Soviet people, during the holding of the 19th Congress, the Party has obtained great achievements in building communism. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Stalin himself, with the great assistance of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, especially the great Russian nationality, the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic has obtained remarkable achievements. In the Soviet era, the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic has changed from a backward border region into an advanced Soviet republic with highly developed industry and agriculture. Culture in national form and socialist content is developing smoothly. Turkmenistan has implemented universal seven-year education, and it has several higher education institutions, a university, and more than fifty scientific institutions. An Academy of Sciences was established in 1951. The Communist Party educates the working people in the spirit of Soviet patriotism, infinite loyalty to the cause of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, and to the cause of communist construction.
    Then Babayev talked about the magnificent prospects for the further development of the Turkmen Republic due to the opening of the Turkmen Grand Canal. He believes that the excavation of this canal must be accelerated. Babayev criticized the Soviet Ministry of Cotton Growing, the Ministry of Power Stations, and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, saying that they did not fully assist the Turkmen Republic.
    Vinidiktov (Moscow) described the achievements of the Soviet Union in the development of agriculture. The Soviet Union has restored and surpassed the pre-war level of production in a short period. In the post-war five-year period, the level of material and technical equipment of farms has improved, and their public enterprises have been further consolidated. The high level of mechanization and improved efficiency of agricultural work on collective farms enables the Soviet Union to increase wheat production to unprecedented levels in the country, making the Soviet Union consistently the world's number one wheat producer.
    There have been great changes in the varieties of crops. In the past five years, the Soviet Union has cultivated 290 new varieties of high-yielding grains and adopted them in agriculture.
    Vinidiktov acknowledged the criticisms made by Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Malenkov in his report, as well as by some representatives in their speeches, regarding the Ministry of Agriculture. He said that the Ministry of Agriculture will take measures to eliminate the existing shortcomings.
    Finally, he described the further development of agriculture under the new Five-Year Plan.
    Korotchenko (Ukrainian Republic) said that the Party organization and the entire people of Soviet Ukraine, like the entire Soviet people, wholeheartedly support the draft directives of the 19th Party Congress on the new Five-Year Plan (a great plan for further struggle for the construction of a communist society). This historical document reflects Stalin's concern for further consolidating the strength of our beloved motherland and for developing the economy and culture of all brotherly republics of the Soviet Union as much as possible.
    The new Five-Year Plan reflects the peaceful aspirations of the Soviet state and demonstrates the greatness of socialism and its absolute superiority over capitalism. It will further consolidate our cooperation with the people's democratic countries.
    Korotchenko described the great achievements of the Soviet people using the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic as an example. Ukraine has completed the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and is now producing more coal, ore, metal, electricity, sugar, and agricultural products than before the war.
    The people of Ukraine gladly welcome the measures stipulated in the draft directives of the Congress to further expand the construction of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station and the South Ukrainian Canal. Considering the great need for electricity and the necessity to start cultivating the new irrigated areas in the south of the republic as soon as possible, Korotchenko suggested that the second post-war Five-Year Plan should stipulate a large amount of investment in order to quickly excavate the South Ukrainian Canal and build the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station. He put forward several other suggestions regarding the further development of certain sectors of the national economy of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.
    Then Bulganin, one of Stalin's closest comrades-in-arms, spoke. The delegates welcomed him with sustained and stormy applause.
    Bulganin reviewed the path the Soviet state has traveled since the 18th Congress. He said that we can point out with satisfaction and pride that the policy of our Party is correct, that it has always taken the interests of the people as its guide for action, and that it has aimed at strengthening the Soviet state as much as possible. The Party's policy and its practical activities were subjected to the greatest test in the difficult days of the Great Patriotic War, when the situation was such that either the Soviet Union would maintain its independence, and our country would continue to have freedom, or it would become a colony, and its people would become slaves of German imperialism. But the Soviet Union overcame the enormous difficulties that no other country could have overcome, and finally achieved victory, proving that it was stronger than Hitler's Germany.
    Bulganin then described the unparalleled achievements and victories of the Soviet army in the Great Patriotic War. Each of these victories can become a glorious page in the military history of our people.
    Bulganin said: The great Stalin is the organizer and inspirer of all the victories of the Soviet people and the Soviet army. The planning and conduct of all decisive battles in the Great Patriotic War, the defeat of Hitler's Germany and militarist Japan—all these achievements were accomplished under the direct guidance of Comrade Stalin and according to his brilliant plan. The results of the war showed the whole world how powerful a force the Soviet Union is. When Bulganin said these words, the hall resounded with stormy applause.
    The post-war years have once again demonstrated the strength of the Soviet state. The Soviet people not only have the strength and the possibility to heal the wounds of war, but also have the strength and the possibility to greatly develop industry, transportation, agriculture, culture, and improve the material welfare of the working people.
    Bulganin then talked about the main issues of the new Five-Year Plan. He emphasized that the tasks stipulated in this plan place significant demands on the Party, Soviet, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations, requiring them to mobilize the broad masses of working people to complete and overfulfill the tasks of this Five-Year Plan. He then talked about the need to further improve the Party's ideological work.
    In the final part of his speech, Bulganin discussed the international situation. He described the conspiracies of the American aggressors who are attempting to incite another world war. Bulganin said that if they bring about this great war, it will cause a powerful counterattack by all freedom-loving people, and freedom-loving people will spare no effort to eliminate capitalism forever. These words caused sustained applause.
    When Bulganin's speech ended, the hall resounded with stormy cheers for the eternity of Stalin. Everyone stood up and shouted: "Long live the great Stalin!"
    At the meeting, Aristov read out a congratulatory telegram from Tokuda, Secretary General of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, amidst warm applause.
    Representative Kuznetsov (Moscow) spoke of the epoch-making victories achieved by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party and under the guidance of the brilliant leader and teacher Comrade Stalin. The directives on the Fifth Five-Year Plan are a brilliant program for the Soviet Union to continue advancing along the road to communism.
    The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates further supplying industry with a large number of complete machines, which will make it possible to further improve the level of mechanization of laborious operations and achieve a high level of labor productivity. Kuznetsov emphasized that the further development of socialist competition on a national scale, the dissemination of the experience of advanced producers, and the expansion of the mass movement of inventions and rationalization proposals are also of the greatest significance for the implementation of the Five-Year Plan.
    Kuznetsov continued by saying that due to the Communist Party's constant concern, great achievements have been made in improving the living standards of the working people during the period between the 18th Congress and the 19th Congress. In 1951, the income of workers and staff, on average, increased by fifty-seven percent per person compared to before the war, and the income of farmers increased by sixty percent. The Soviet people can currently purchase twice as many goods for the same amount of money as in 1947. Just in terms of the state's social insurance expenditure, it increased from 8.6 billion rubles in 1940 to 21.4 billion rubles in 1952. The number of sanatoriums and rest homes is constantly increasing. This year, 4.5 million workers and staff will go on vacation to various resort areas across the country.
    A large part of Kuznetsov's speech talked about the consolidation of the fraternal relations and friendship between the Soviet people and the working people of other countries, and about the consolidation of the solidarity of the international working class. Kuznetsov said: The working class in capitalist countries is more resolutely and in a more organized way opposing the policies of hunger, poverty, and war pursued by the imperialist governments.
    When Ponomarenko appeared on the podium, the delegates welcomed him warmly.
    Ponomarenko pointed out that the various achievements of the Soviet state summarized in the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and in the report on the new Five-Year Plan demonstrate the victory of the Party's general line, the selfless spirit of the Soviet people, the supreme loyalty of the Soviet people to the Party, to the Central Committee, and to Comrade Stalin, and that they are closely united around the Party, the Central Committee, and Comrade Stalin.
    The tasks stipulated in these reports show the Party's great concern for the further upsurge of the national economy and for the further improvement of the material welfare and cultural standards of the Soviet people.
    The situation in the imperialist camp, the camp of aggression, is completely the opposite. The characteristics of that camp are: the absolute and relative impoverishment of the working class, the decline of agriculture, and the bankruptcy of the vast masses of toiling peasants. For example, in Turkey, which is unreasonably praised as a model of a free country by American big shots, five million peasant households are indeed "free"... free to the point of not even having a small piece of land. And among the peasant households that do have such a small piece of land, only one in 150 has a plow.
    Ponomarenko said that the socialist transformation of the countryside is one of the greatest achievements of the Soviet system. All the necessary conditions have been created for the smooth development of agriculture equipped with powerful new-style machines. This year, the total grain output has reached 8 billion poods. The continuous increase in total grain output is the main achievement of socialist agriculture.
    Due to the various achievements in agriculture, the quality and quantity of agricultural products and raw materials handed over to the state have been significantly improved. Ponomarenko listed moving figures, pointing out that the amount of grain, meat, milk, wool, sugar beets, etc. handed over to the state is increasing year by year.
    Ponomarenko said that all men and women across the Soviet Union are delighted by the great achievements obtained in our country's agriculture. These achievements indisputably prove the decisive superiority of socialist agriculture over capitalist agriculture. The new Five-Year Plan has opened up even broader prospects for the development of socialist agriculture.
    Rakosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, was warmly welcomed by the delegates. He extended his warm congratulations to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on behalf of his Party and the Hungarian people. His speech was repeatedly interrupted by prolonged and stormy applause. Rakosi spoke of the new life being built in the People's Democratic Hungary, and that the Hungarian people were liberated with the help of the Soviet Union. Rakosi then said that the Hungarian working people not only regard the Soviet Union as their liberator, but also as the model they follow, and as the foundation of their progress and happiness. The Hungarian people understand that their position is within the powerful peace camp of 800 million people led by the Soviet Union. In this camp, they are faithfully and selflessly fighting for their bright future and against the manufacturers of imperialist wars. We have a lot to learn from this unshakable unity and bold and correct constructive criticism and self-criticism, which we have personally seen in this Congress, and these are the source of new victories. The Hungarian Working People's Party and the Hungarian people sincerely and warmly congratulate the vanguard of the international revolutionary workers' movement, the battle-tested vanguard of the people of all countries in their struggle for freedom and peace—the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the success of its 19th Congress.
    When the chairman invited Harry Pollitt, the long-tested leader of the workers' movement and General Secretary of the British Communist Party, to speak, the hall resounded with another round of warm applause.
    Harry Pollitt said that he and John Gollan, on behalf of the British Communist Party, extended sincere fraternal congratulations to the historic 19th Congress of the great Soviet Communist Party and its leader, the teacher and friend of the working people of the world, Comrade Stalin. They were deeply proud of this high honor. These words elicited stormy applause. Pollitt emphasized the great significance of the Congress for workers all over the world, including the British working people who are fighting for peace and socialism. The 19th Congress, more fully than ever before, demonstrated the Soviet people's construction plans, correct ideas, and humanitarian spirit. For the people of the Western world who are living in a state of economic panic and in an atmosphere of war hysteria, it is a shining beacon, and it once again demonstrates that the Soviet people live for constructive labor, not for destruction, and for peace, not for war! (Applause)
    The 19th Congress pointed out the road to communism. It marks a new era (the Stalin era in world human history) of complete freedom, happiness, and the great ideal of a peaceful life. (Stormy and lasting applause)
    The afternoon session of the Congress ended after Harry Pollitt's speech. The next session will be held on October 9th.

    苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会第四日会议
    讨论大会关于新五年计划的指示草案
    通过批准联共（布）中央检查委员会报告的决议
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科九日电：苏联共产党
    （布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会在十月八日继续开会。大会上午会议由安德里亚诺夫担任主席。
    他允许阿里斯托夫提出关于联共（布）中央检查委员会的报告的动议。阿里斯托夫提议批准联共（布）中央检查委员会的报告。大会一致通过了这项动议。
    大会在通过关于中央检查委员会的报告的决议后，进而讨论第三项议程：“第十九次党代表大会关于一九五一年—一九五五年苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示”。由国家计划委员会主席马·萨·萨布罗夫同志作报告。
    萨布罗夫在报告开始时着重指出第五个五年计划继续了前几个斯大林五年计划的和平发展苏联经济、有计划地扩大社会主义经济及改善人民福利的路线。第五个五年计划的实现，将是苏联逐渐从社会主义过渡到共产主义的一个重要阶段。
    萨布罗夫说，由于完成了前一个即第四个五年计划，战前苏联国民经济发展的水平已被大大超过了。它的胜利完成，使得第五个五年计划的采行成为可能。第五个五年计划将保证国民经济各部门的进一步发展和人民文化水平与生活水平的提高。
    接着他列举出了新五年计划的主要指数。报告里面列举的许多数字反映了苏联人民不断加速地向共产主义前进。
    新五年计划规定在五年内工业产量增加百分之七十左右。这就是说，在一九五五年工业总产量将为战前水平的三倍。工业发展的每年平均速率约为百分之十二。
    我们的社会主义工业不仅将要在量上增加，而且也要在质上提高。费力的操作将完全机械化，生产将广泛自动化，国民经济的动力资源将要增加。伏尔加河上的伟大共产主义建设工程之一——古比雪夫水电站及其他庞大的动力厂的完成，将在这项工作中起重要的作用。
    农业也有着同样光辉的前景。农业的机械化水平将进一步提高，耕作的效率将更加提高，单位面积产量也要增加。将种植五百万公顷的防护林带，建造三万五千个池塘和水库，灌溉田地的面积将扩大百分之三十至三十五。
    铁路、海洋、内河、空中和汽车运输以及通讯工具将大规模地发展。
    在国民经济发展的基础上，人民的物质和文化水平将大大提高。苏联的国民收入在五年时期之内至少将增加百分之六十。
    计划规定基本建设的总量比第四个五年计划约增加百分之九十。
    萨布罗夫着重指出，新计划明白地反映了社会主义基本经济法则的必要条件：用在最高技术基础上不断发展和改进社会主义生产的方法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    他接着指出：党组织在讨论五年计划指示草案时，提出了许多建议和补充。所有这些建议和补充充满了对于国家全面发展的关怀。这个文件受到了苏维埃人民和各人民民主国家的劳动人民的最热烈的欢迎，他们从这个文件中看到了他们的将来和加强全世界和平事业的强大因素。
    萨布罗夫同志在结束他的报告时说：苏联人民将不遗余力地保证胜利完成并超额完成这个五年计划。苏联人民紧密地团结在共产党的周围、团结在他们敬爱的领袖和导师斯大林同志的周围，正在满怀信心地向着共产主义前进。与会者对他的话报以暴风雨般的掌声。
    在短时的休会后，代表大会对萨布罗夫的报告进行讨论。
    阿里斯托夫（车里雅宾斯克）首先发言，他强调指出第十九次党代表大会对于在苏维埃国土上建设共产主义、对于国际共产主义运动有着十分重大的意义。这次代表大会将大大加强我们的党的力量，将进一步提高苏联在全世界劳动人民中间的威信。
    阿里斯托夫指出：新五年计划中规定的苏联进一步发展的速度是很大的，但是毫无疑问是完全切实可行的。
    在第十八次党代表大会以后的年代中，车里雅宾斯克州的主要工业——钢铁工业——增长了，现在它所生产的金属比沙皇俄国的全部金属产量还要多。这一州的工厂极有可能大大超过规定的生产目标。
    阿里斯托夫建议规定加速开凿并采掘矿藏，他指出了工业企业设计上的落后现象，并强调必须扩大科学与生产之间的联系并增加车里雅宾斯克州的科学研究机关的数目。
    阿里斯托夫强调：车里雅宾斯克州的谷物已完全可以自给。他提议研究提早播种的问题以保证提高产量。
    他继续说，在战后的年代，乌拉尔已变成了国民经济的最大的基地之一和伟大的共产主义建设工程所需要的金属、机器和装备的主要供应者之一。苏维埃乌拉尔的力量来自人民，他们对于祖国，对于他们自己的党，对于伟大的斯大林——东方的煤与冶金的第二中心区的创造者——都是无限忠诚的。
    石油工业部部长巴伊巴科夫接着发言，他谈到从第十八次代表大会到第十九次代表大会这段时期内在石油开采和提炼工业中发生的重大变化。政府曾经采取措施使遭受德国法西斯侵略者蹂躏的地区的石油工业迅速恢复并大规模发展新地区的石油开采业。根据斯大林同志的指示，在伏尔加和乌拉尔之间建立了一个新的产油中心——第二个巴库。在其他产油地区也发生了重大的变化。
    就已经经过勘察的石油资源来说，苏联现在居于世界石油最丰富的国家之列，这就使我们有可能大大增加工作的速度，提前完成斯大林同志关于把石油的年产量提高到六千万吨的指示。
    国家已建立了新的瓦斯工业。巨大的瓦斯管干线和瓦斯工厂已经建立。经过勘察的天然瓦斯资源使许多城市得到瓦斯供应成为可能，同时还使瓦斯化学工程的发展成为可能。
    代表大会的指示草案给石油工人规定了特别重要的任务。指示草案规定，增加提油量百分之八十五。巴伊巴科夫说，这就是说，石油工人必须完成巨大规模的重大的任务。
    巴伊巴科夫认为代表大会的指示草案强调需要在国家的东部各州进一步提高石油产量，需要大大地增加钻探量，以及广泛地采用新法开采油矿。
    巴伊巴科夫在结语中说，毫无疑问，在我们光荣的党的领导下，苏联石油工人一定能提前完成第五个五年计划中关于石油和瓦斯的开采与制炼的任务。
    在上午会议快结束时，许多外国共产党的代表发表了祝贺演说。代表大会的代表们以热烈的鼓掌欢迎这些代表各个国家的劳动人民的来宾。国际共产主义运动领袖们的演说深刻地表现了在争取和平、民主与社会主义的斗争中的友谊与团结。
    与会者热烈地欢迎中国共产党书记刘少奇，他向代表们转达了中国共产党和全体伟大的中国人民的友好祝贺。在暴风雨般的掌声中，他宣读了由毛泽东主席签字的中国共产党中央委员会的祝词（祝词另发）。他的话博得了代表们的经久不息的掌声。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党主席克利门特·哥特瓦尔德受到了热烈的欢迎。他在演说开始时代表捷克斯洛伐克共产党和全体劳动人民向代表大会致贺。他说：第十九次代表大会召开的消息及关于代表大会的历史性文件的发表在他的国家内得到了非常广泛的响应。几十万捷克斯洛伐克的城乡劳动人民为迎接代表大会承担了社会主义任务并正在胜利地完成这些任务。哥特瓦尔德说，捷克斯洛伐克共产党一向是向布尔什维克党人学习如何战斗和如何获胜的。斯大林同志的新的重要著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”是捷克斯洛伐克共产党在建立并加强社会主义制度的日常斗争中和在维护和平的工作中的取之不尽的经验的源泉。
    哥特瓦尔德代表捷克斯洛伐克共产党和整个国家为捷克斯洛伐克人民从苏联获得的极其宝贵的援助向苏联劳动人民、向苏联共产党（布尔什维克）和斯大林同志本人，致衷心的感谢。
    哥特瓦尔德的发言一再为代表们的长时间的掌声所打断。
    然后由意大利共产党副总书记隆哥讲话，代表们对他表示热烈欢迎。
    他奉意大利共产党中央委员会及陶里亚蒂本人之命，向代表们、布尔什维克党及其伟大的领袖斯大林同志转达意大利二百五十万共产党员和共产主义青年团团员，以及工人、农民、其他劳动人民和民主分子的兄弟敬礼和祝贺。
    隆哥说，我们向你们、向你们的代表大会和斯大林同志致敬，就是向使欧洲和全世界免受法西斯压迫的救星致敬，就是向新的共产主义社会的建设者致敬，他们给人类指出走向解放和进步的道路，就是向国际和平与友好的保护者致敬！
    隆哥指出：共产主义的伟大胜利带给意大利劳动人民欢欣，鼓舞着他们的斗争。这些胜利有助于维护世界和平并有助于加强国际友好关系。隆哥的发言屡为经久不息的掌声所打断。
    上午会议至此休会。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科九日电：苏联共产党
    （布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会八日下午会议继续讨论马·萨·萨布罗夫所作的“第十九次党代表大会关于一九五一年—一九五五年苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示”的报告。
    这次会议主席尼雅佐夫让土库曼苏维埃社会主义共和国代表巴巴耶夫发言。巴巴耶夫说：和全体苏维埃人民一样，在举行第十九次代表大会时，党在建设共产主义方面获得了伟大的成就。在党中央委员会和斯大林同志本人的领导下，在苏联各民族，首先是伟大的俄罗斯民族的巨大帮助下，土库曼苏维埃社会主义共和国获得了显著的成就。在苏维埃时代，土库曼苏维埃社会主义共和国已从一个落后的边疆地区转变为一个工业和农业高度发达的先进的苏维埃共和国。民族形式、社会主义内容的文化正在顺利地发展。土库曼已实行了普及七年制教育，它有几个高等教育机关、一所大学、五十多个科学机关。一九五一年成立了一个科学院。共产党以苏维埃爱国主义、对列宁和斯大林党的事业及对共产主义建设事业的无限忠诚的精神教育劳动人民。
    接着巴巴耶夫谈到由于土库曼大运河的开凿，土库曼共和国面临进一步发展的宏伟远景。他认为必须加速开凿这条运河。巴巴耶夫批评了苏联植棉部、电站部和邮电部等，说它们没有充分援助土库曼共和国。
    维尼迪克托夫（莫斯科）叙述了苏联在农业的发展方面获得的成就。苏联在短期内就恢复了并且超过了战前的生产水平。在战后五年期中，农场的物质技术设备水平提高了，它们的公有企业进一步巩固了。集体农场农业工作机械化的高度水平和耕作效率的提高使苏联可以把小麦的产量提高到国内空前的数字，使苏联小麦的产量稳居世界第一位。
    在作物的品种方面发生了很大的变化。在过去五年内，苏联培育了二百九十种产量很高的各种谷物的新品种，并在农业中采用了。
    维尼迪克托夫承认联共（布）中央委员会书记马林科夫在报告中以及一些代表在发言中对农业部提出的批评。他说，农业部将采取措施消灭现有的缺点。
    最后他叙述了在新的五年计划下农业进一步发展的情形。
    科罗特钦科（乌克兰共和国）说，苏维埃乌克兰的党组织和全体人民像整个苏联人民一样，衷心地拥护第十九次党代表大会关于新五年计划（更进一步为建设共产主义社会而斗争的伟大计划）的指示草案。这个历史性的文件反映了斯大林对于进一步巩固可爱的祖国的实力，对于尽一切可能发展苏联所有兄弟共和国的经济与文化的关怀。
    新五年计划反映了苏维埃国家的和平愿望，表现了社会主义的伟大以及它对资本主义的绝对优越性。它将愈加巩固我们与各人民民主国家之间的合作。
    科罗特钦科以乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国为例，叙述了苏维埃人民的巨大成就。乌克兰已提前完成了战后五年计划，现在正生产着比战前为多的煤、矿砂、金属、电力、糖和农产品。
    乌克兰人民愉快地欢迎代表大会的指示草案所规定的为进一步展开卡霍夫卡水电站和南乌克兰运河的建设而采取的措施。考虑到对电力的大量需要，考虑到尽早开始垦殖共和国南部新的灌溉地区的必要性，科罗特钦科建议第二个战后五年计划应规定大量的投资，以便能够迅速开凿南乌克兰运河和兴建卡霍夫卡水电站。他提出了关于进一步发展乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国国民经济的某些部门的若干其他建议。
    接着由斯大林的最亲密的战友之一布尔加宁发言。代表们以经久不息的暴风雨般的掌声对他表示欢迎。
    布尔加宁回顾了苏维埃国家自第十八次代表大会以来所经历的道路。他说，我们可以满意而骄傲地指出，我们党的政策是正确的，它始终以人民的利益为它的行动指南，并以极力巩固苏维埃国家为其目的。党的政策和它的实际活动在伟大爱国战争的艰苦的日子里受到了最大的考验，当时的情形是这样的：或者是苏联保持它的独立、我们的国家继续有着自由，或者是它变成一个殖民地、它的人民成为德国帝国主义的奴隶，二者必居其一。可是，苏联克服了非其他任何国家所能克服的巨大困难，终于取得了胜利，证明它是比希特勒德国更坚强的。
    布尔加宁接着叙述苏维埃军队在卫国战争中所获得的无与伦比的业绩与胜利。在其中每一个胜利都可以成为我们人民的军事史上辉煌的一页。
    布尔加宁说：伟大的斯大林是苏维埃人民和苏维埃军队的一切胜利的组织者与鼓舞者。伟大卫国战争中一切决定性的战役的筹划与进行，希特勒德国和军国主义日本之被击溃——所有这些业绩都是在斯大林同志的直接指导下，按照他的天才计划完成的。战争的结果向全世界表明了苏联是一个多么强大的力量。布尔加宁说这些话的时候，大厅里响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    战后的年代再度表示了苏维埃国家的力量。苏联人民不仅有力量和可能来医治战争创伤，而且也有力量和可能来大大发展工业、运输业、农业、文化及提高劳动人民的物质福利。
    布尔加宁接着谈到新五年计划的主要问题。他着重指出，这个计划所规定的任务向党、苏维埃、工会及共产主义青年团组织提出了重大的要求，要它们动员广大的劳动人民群众来完成和超额完成这个五年计划的任务。他接着谈到必须进一步提高党的思想工作。
    布尔加宁在他的发言的最后部分讨论了国际局势。他叙述了企图煽起另一次世界大战的美国侵略者的阴谋。布尔加宁说，假如他们促成了这个大战，那么这将引起一切爱好自由的人民的有力的反击，爱好自由的人民将不遗余力地把资本主义永远消灭掉。这些话引起了经久不息的掌声。
    当布尔加宁的发言结束时，大厅中响起了暴风雨般地欢呼斯大林万岁的声音。全体起立高呼：“伟大的斯大林万岁！”
    会上，阿里斯托夫在热烈的掌声中宣读了日本共产党中央委员会总书记德田的贺电。
    代表库兹涅佐夫（莫斯科）说到苏联人民在共产党领导下、在天才的领袖与导师斯大林同志指引下所获得的划时代的胜利。关于第五个五年计划的指示乃是苏联沿着走向共产主义的道路继续前进的辉煌的纲领。
    第五个五年计划规定进一步以完备的机器大量供应工业，这就可能使费力的操作机械化的水平更加提高，达到高度的劳动生产率。库兹涅佐夫强调指出：进一步发展全国规模的社会主义竞赛、传播先进生产者的经验以及扩大发明与合理化建议的群众性运动对于执行五年计划也是具有最大意义的。
    库兹涅佐夫接着说：由于共产党的不断关怀，在第十八次代表大会和第十九次代表大会之间这一段时期中，在提高劳动人民的生活水平方面获得了极大的成就。一九五一年职工收入，平均每人比战前增加了百分之五十七，农民的收入增加了百分之六十。苏联人民目前可以用同样的钱数购得相当于一九四七年两倍的物品。单就国家的社会保险经费来说，一九四○年为八十六亿卢布，一九五二年就增加到了二百一十四亿卢布。疗养院和休养所的数目正在不断增加。今年赴全国各疗养区度假的职工将达四百五十万人。
    库兹涅佐夫的演说有很大一部分谈到苏联人民与其他国家劳动人民兄弟关系和友谊的巩固，谈到国际工人阶级团结的巩固。库兹涅佐夫说：资本主义国家的工人阶级正在更加坚决地而且以更有组织的方式来反对帝国主义政府所奉行的饥饿、贫穷与战争的政策。
    波诺马林科在讲台上出现时，代表们予以热烈欢迎。
    波诺马林科指出：苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会的报告中以及关于新五年计划的报告中所总结的苏联国家的各种成就，证明了党的总路线的胜利、证明了苏联人民的忘我精神，证明了苏联人民对党、对中央委员会、对斯大林同志无上忠诚并且亲密团结在党、中央委员会和斯大林同志的周围。
    这些报告中所规定的任务，表明了党对于国民经济的更进一步高涨、对于苏联人民的物质生活福利和文化水平的更进一步提高非常关心。
    帝国主义阵营、侵略阵营中的情形却是完全相反的，那个阵营中所表现的特征是：工人阶级的绝对贫穷化和相对贫穷化，农业衰落，广大劳苦农民群众破产。例如，在美国大头子毫无道理地誉为自由国家模范的土耳其，五百万农户是的确“自由”了……自由到连一小块土地都没有了。而有这么一小块土地的农户，一百五十家之中仅有一家有一付犁。
    波诺马林科说：乡村实行社会主义的改造乃是苏维埃制度的最大成果之一。已为备有强大新式机器的农业的顺利发展创造了一切必要条件。今年谷物总产量已达八十亿普特，谷物总产量的不断增加乃是社会主义农业的主要成就。
    由于农业方面的各种成就，交给国家的农产品与原料的质量和数量都很显著地增进了。波诺马林科列举动人的数字，指出交给国家的谷物、肉类、牛奶、羊毛、甜菜等等都一年比一年增多。
    波诺马林科说：苏联全国男女都因为我国农业方面所得到的伟大成就而欢欣鼓舞。这些成就不容争论地证明了社会主义农业较之资本主义农业具有决定性的优越性。新五年计划为社会主义农业的发展开拓了更加远大的前途。
    匈牙利劳动人民党总书记拉科西受到代表们热烈的欢迎，他代表他的党和匈牙利人民向苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会表示热烈的祝贺。他的演说一再被历久不息的暴风雨般的掌声所打断。拉科西说到在人民民主的匈牙利建立的新生活，说到匈牙利人民是赖苏联的帮助而得到解放的。　拉科西接着说：匈牙利劳动人民不但把苏联看作他们的解放者，而且也看作他们所效法的榜样，看作他们进步和幸福的基础。匈牙利人民了解他们的地位是在以苏联为首的八亿人民的强大的和平阵营里面。在这个阵营里面，他们忠诚地、忘我地为他们的美好的将来、为反对帝国主义战争制造者而斗争。从这种不可动摇的团结一致和大胆而正确的建设性的批评与自我批评上，我们要学习很多的东西，这些都是我们在这里的代表大会中亲眼看到的，这些都是新胜利的源泉。匈牙利劳动人民党和匈牙利人民衷心地、热烈地祝贺国际革命工人运动的先锋队、各国人民为自由与和平而斗争的经过战斗考验的先锋队——光荣的苏联共产党及其第十九次代表大会的成功。
    当主席请久经锻炼的工人运动领袖、英国共产党总书记哈利·波立特发言时，全场又响起一片热烈的掌声。
    哈利·波立特说：他和约翰·高兰代表英国共产党向伟大的苏联共产党的具有历史意义的第十九次代表大会和它的领袖、全世界劳动人民的导师和朋友斯大林同志表示诚恳的兄弟般的祝贺。他们深以这种高度的荣誉引为骄傲。这些话引起了暴风雨般的掌声。波立特着重指出代表大会对全世界工人包括为和平与社会主义奋斗的英国劳动人民在内的重大意义。第十九次代表大会比以前任何时期都更充分地表现出苏联人民的建设计划、正确思想和人道精神，对于生活在经济恐慌的情况下、生活在战争歇斯底里的气氛中的西方世界的各国人民，是一座光芒万丈的灯塔，它又一次表现出：苏联人民是为建设性的劳动不是为破坏而生活的，是为和平不是为战争而生活的！（鼓掌）
    第十九次代表大会指出到达共产主义的道路。它标志着一个新时代（世界人类历史上的斯大林时代）的完全自由、幸福、和平的生活的伟大理想。（暴风雨般的历久不息的掌声）
    大会下午会议在哈利·波立特的演说以后宣告结束。下一次会议将在十月九日举行。
