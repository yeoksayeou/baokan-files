Xinhua News Agency Report: The sixth day of the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference continued on the afternoon of the seventh at 3:20 PM. The executive chairpersons of the afternoon meeting were: Mrs. Grace Knight (Canada), Don Philip Gunawardena (Ceylon), Hegayev (Soviet Union), Rafael López Malo (Mexico), Rasuna Said (Indonesia).

The meeting proceeded under the chairmanship of Grace Knight, a worker in the United Church of Canada. Deputy Secretary-General Hai announced that representatives attending the conference were continuing to arrive. Currently, there were 361 representatives from 37 countries, 37 observers, and representatives from international organizations and specially invited observers, totaling 418 people.

The afternoon meeting heard speeches from Echeverria, Vice President of the International Union of Students, and representatives from Japan, India, Korea, New Zealand, the Soviet Union, Australia, Burma, and Costa Rica. The representatives' speeches fully demonstrated the love of peace among the people of various countries. When representatives from Japan, Korea, Burma, and other countries spoke about their people's opposition to the revival of Japanese militarism and their demand for the establishment of a peaceful and democratic Japan, the whole venue repeatedly erupted in thunderous applause.

After the meeting began, the chair first invited Echeverria, Vice President of the International Union of Students, to speak. On behalf of the International Union of Students, representing 5.3 million students from 72 countries, he paid tribute to all attendees. He pointed out that the colonial system was the mortal enemy of democratic education, and the situation of students in colonies and dependent countries was particularly serious, with extremely poor learning, living, and sanitary conditions. Students in these regions played an important role in the struggle for national independence and peace because they knew that only by eliminating the colonial system could the situation of students be improved simultaneously. He announced that the International Union of Students would convene the Third World Student Congress next summer, and students in the Asia and Pacific regions, in particular, should use the preparations for the congress to promote the work of struggling for peace and national independence and strengthen friendly ties with students around the world. He concluded by saying that the resolutions produced by the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference would help students in this region play a greater role in the cause of world peace.

After his speech, Echeverria, on behalf of the International Union of Students, presented the China Peace Committee with a carved glass bottle, expressing the respect of students from all countries for the great Chinese people. When the gift was presented, the whole venue stood up and applauded for a long time.

Ogura Kinji, a member of the Japanese delegation and a representative of the Japan Youth Homeland Front, spoke about the suffering and struggle of Japanese youth. He pointed out that the American occupation authorities were causing extreme disaster and humiliation to Japanese youth, women, and students. The American army was recruiting Japanese youth as mercenaries. However, the Japanese people would never allow this heinous conspiracy to succeed. "Japanese youth will no longer take up guns to fight against their Asian brothers" and "Women will no longer send their husbands, sons, and loved ones to the battlefield" had become the common slogans of all Japanese youth and mothers. A signature campaign against the revival of militarism and conscription was currently underway throughout Japan. Ogura Kinji's speech expressed the firm determination of Japanese youth to oppose war and was warmly welcomed by the whole venue with thunderous applause.

Govind Sahai, a member of the Indian delegation, former Parliamentary Secretary of the Northern Province Government, and currently a member of the Northern Province Legislative Assembly, took the stage to speak. He said that the San Francisco "Peace Treaty with Japan" and the "US-Japan Security Treaty" deprived Japan of its sovereignty and violated the basic peaceful requirement of maintaining friendly relations between Japan and all Pacific coastal countries. This was a measure taken by the United States to promote its war plans. The Indian people supported the Japanese people in opposing these two treaties and believed that they should be replaced by a genuine treaty signed by all relevant countries. This treaty should stipulate the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Japan, prohibit any foreign country from establishing military bases in Japan, and ensure that the Japanese people enjoy complete sovereignty. Sahai said that the peace movement in India was developing, and the fact that more than sixty representatives came to participate in the conference showed that enthusiasm for the peace movement had arisen in our country. Sahai emphasized that the opportunity for the Indian delegation to meet with their Pakistani brothers in Beijing to discuss enhancing peaceful friendship between the two countries was an important task for the peace movements in India and Pakistan.

Jeong Seong-yeon, Deputy Head of the Korean Delegation and a member of the Korean National Committee for the Defence of Peace, then spoke, focusing on the Japanese issue.

Montague, Head of the New Zealand Delegation and National Secretary of the New Zealand Peace Council, spoke next.

After Montague's speech, fifty-four representatives from more than thirty ethnic groups in China, including Mongolians, Tibetans, Manchus, Huis, Miaos, Yaos, Yis, Sanis, Dais, Zhuangs, and Gaoshans, wearing brightly colored national costumes and carrying the love and respect of all Chinese ethnic groups for the conference, entered the venue to music. They presented hadas and flowers to the presidium. Then, representatives of Muslims in Beijing presented the conference with a huge red banner more than a zhang long. During the presentation of gifts and banners, the venue erupted in prolonged applause, fully demonstrating the close unity between peace fighters from Asian and Pacific countries and the Chinese people.

After a break, the meeting continued at 5:30 PM, chaired by Don Philip Gunawardena, a member of the Ceylon delegation and a journalist.

Hegayev, a Soviet representative and Chairman of the Peace Committee of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, took the stage to speak amidst warm applause. He extended greetings to representatives from all countries on behalf of the people of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and pointed out that the Soviet people firmly opposed the adventurous actions of the imperialists and advocated peaceful methods to resolve all disputes. Hegayev expressed his support for the program of action for defending peace proposed in Guo Moruo's report. He described in detail the rapid development of the economic and cultural lives of the people of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic after the establishment of the Soviet regime. He said that the people of the sunny and prosperous Soviet Uzbekistan would continue to work actively with the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union and the people of all countries for the noble cause of world peace.

The speech by Mrs. Ralph, an Australian representative who had lived and worked in China for thirty-five years, vividly and kindly expressed the firm will of good people to strive for peace, and was warmly welcomed by the whole venue. When Mrs. Ralph solemnly declared that they were about to leave China to return to their country to continue their peace work in response to an urgent call, the venue resounded with prolonged applause. Her simple and moving speech was warmly welcomed by the whole venue. The attendees all stood up and applauded for a long time.

Su Po Dun (formerly translated as Ma Po Deng), Secretary of the Burmese Delegation and Vice Chairman of the Karen National Congress, expressed the views of the Burmese people, who had personally suffered the horrors of Japanese fascism, on the Japanese issue. Su Po Dun said that the Burmese people had learned from their own experience that the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" meant blood, sweat, and tears for them, but the Burmese people had also heard the original Japanese fascists shouting out "Greater East Asia Zone" again. Su Po Dun pointed out that American imperialism and its Japanese lackeys were clamoring for the rearmament of Japan, which meant that the danger of suffering was about to recur, even more seriously. Su Po Dun expressed the sympathy of the Burmese people for the Japanese people. He said: We are determined to unite with the Japanese people to oppose the interference, occupation, and enslavement of American imperialism. Su Po Dun, on behalf of the Burmese delegation, supported the proposals on the Japanese issue put forward by Guo Moruo and the Japanese representatives and expressed the hope that there could be concrete ways of cooperation between the people of Asian and Pacific countries and the Japanese people. The people of all countries should support the struggle of the Japanese people for independence, peace, and democracy in every possible way.

Vital Murillo, a Costa Rican representative and mathematics professor, then spoke as a Catholic.

Next, Deputy Secretary-General Hai announced that the conference had received congratulatory messages from the following organizations and individuals: the Lao Free National United Front, the American Peace Crusaders, the Albanian National Peace Committee, the Red Cross Society of China, the Connecticut Peace Committee of the United States, the Youth Peace and Friendship Council of Northern California, the Swedish Mr. Flormonto, the West Finland Peace Committee, the Esperanto Peace Committee of Denmark, and Mr. Rene of Belgium.

The meeting adjourned amidst applause after announcing the program for tomorrow.

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: The seventh day of the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference began at 9:20 AM on the 8th. Nine representatives spoke at the meeting, some from Southeast Asia, some from the Middle East, some from Latin America, some from the United States, and some from the French colony of Algeria in distant North Africa. These representatives from different countries all expressed the peace wishes of their people to the conference. Their speeches deeply impressed people with the firm determination of those fighting for national independence to strive for peace. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by peace fighters from all countries.

The executive chairpersons of the meeting were: Xu Chunzhi (Korea), Ataur Rahman (Pakistan), Ravi Shankar Shivram Vyas (India), Louis Alley (New Zealand), Nguyen Xuan Thuy (Vietnam).

After the executive chairperson, Korean representative Xu Chunzhi, announced the start of the meeting, Ahmed Kassal, a representative from Syria and Lebanon, spoke first.

Ahmed Kassal pointed out that the people of Syria and Lebanon, who are fighting to defend peace and national independence, broadly support this historically significant peace conference. Because this conference will make a great contribution to the peaceful resolution of the Japanese issue, the cessation of the Korean War, and the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. He then described the struggle of the people of Syria and Lebanon against the Middle East Command, which aims at aggression, demanding a stop to the Korean War, protesting against the US government's bacteriological warfare, and demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. He pointed out that although the military dictatorship had carried out brutal suppression of the peace movement, the people of Syria and Lebanon had not bowed their heads. They knew that in the struggle for peace and national independence, their brothers in the Asia and Pacific regions, the great Soviet Union, and the People's China were with them. He exclaimed: The awakened Arab peoples are no longer asleep. They will not rest easy until they have achieved peace, freedom, and national independence.

Narawila Dhammaratana, the head of the Ceylonese delegation, wearing a yellow robe and enjoying social prestige in Ceylon, was warmly welcomed when he took the stage to speak. He excitedly announced that the Ceylonese government's trade delegation had recently signed an equal and mutually beneficial trade agreement with China, with China supplying Ceylon with 80,000 tons of much-needed rice, and the Ceylonese government guaranteeing China the convenience of purchasing rubber in Ceylon. He said that if Asian and Pacific countries could conduct such equal and mutually beneficial trade, it would bring stability and peace to our region and the world. His speech immediately caused unanimous and excited applause from representatives of all countries.

In his speech, Dhammaratana also pointed out that the people of Ceylon had long suffered the pain of being trampled underfoot by foreign oppressors. Now, due to Ceylon's important strategic position in the Indian Ocean, its bases and ports were being used by imperialists to carry out military aggression, and its minerals were being shipped away to manufacture atomic weapons. At the same time, the United States' lowering of rubber prices and forced embargo had caused serious consequences for Ceylon's economy. Only after China bought Ceylon's rubber did Ceylon avoid a total collapse in rubber prices. He said that Ceylon had to rely on imports for two-thirds of its food, and only peace could bring Ceylon daily food. The people of Ceylon urgently hoped to take all possible steps to stop the war-mongers' heinous acts in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and especially in Japan. Dhammaratana said: After we return home, we will do our best to turn our peace movement into a genuine mass movement. He said: The people of Asian countries who are still fighting for freedom are watching the example set by the great Chinese people with envious and grateful eyes. His speech received a warm response.

Suri Tongwanit, a Thai representative, pointed out in his speech that because Thailand has abundant resources and is in a strategic location, the United States has spared no effort to turn Thailand into a base for launching aggressive wars. He also pointed out that this behavior of the United States threatened peace in Asia and damaged Thailand's independence and autonomy. Suri Tongwanit condemned the United States for reviving Japanese militarism as a tool for aggression against Asia, and the US military's barbaric crimes of conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea. He said: The Thai government has sent troops to Korea to fight alongside the US military, and many Thai soldiers have become cannon fodder. Stopping the Korean War and withdrawing Thai troops is the unanimous demand of the Thai people. The embargo on goods to people's democratic countries has caused hardship for the Thai people. Since Thailand joined the "embargo," rubber prices have fallen by more than 60 percent. The Thai people demand the abolition of the "embargo" and need freedom of trade. Suri Tongwanit pointed out that American control and the Thai government's policy of promoting military expansion and war preparation are the root causes of all the hardships of the Thai people. He firmly declared: For national independence and for a free and happy life, the way out for the Thai people is to unite with the 1.6 billion people in the Asia and Pacific regions and fight against the aggressors.

After Suri Tongwanit spoke, the Thai delegation, carrying flowers and a green banner embroidered with a dove of peace, walked to the podium, presented it to the representatives of the heroic Korean people in battle, and embraced the Korean representatives excitedly. Amid thunderous applause, Suri Tongwanit read out the dedication of the Thai delegation, which said: "We, the entire members of the Thai delegation, extend our sincere respects to our Korean brothers who have sent representatives to this peace conference! The Thai government was the first government in Asia to send troops to participate in the aggression against Korea, but this is the matter of the Thai government, it is not the will of the Thai people. We want to firmly declare here: We - the Thai people have been constantly preventing this unjust action and opposing the atrocities in Korea. We also want to declare that the Thai people love and sympathize with their Korean brothers very much. The Thai people are fighting to make the Thai government withdraw its troops in Korea." This solemn statement once again aroused a storm of applause.

Valadares, the head of the Nicaraguan delegation and a psychologist, spoke next. He first expressed his respect to the representatives of all countries attending the conference and to the Chinese people, and expressed his enthusiastic support for the heroic struggle of the people of Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and Laos against imperialist aggression. He pointed out that due to the Nicaraguan government's policy of preparing for war, the people of the whole country are currently encountering a serious economic crisis. The Nicaraguan government attempted to send young people to participate in the aggressive war against Korea, but this intention was immediately rejected by people of all walks of life. Valadares said: In the history of the republic since its founding, the Nicaraguan people have encountered the terror of foreign occupation three times. American troops have killed and plundered our people. We reiterate our determination to fight for the peace of our country. Although our situation is very difficult, we must still do so. Although our country is small, we will certainly be able to do our part to achieve peaceful understanding between countries.

Guchi Mohammed, an observer representing the Algerian people who are bravely fighting for national independence, walked onto the stage amidst warm applause. Guchi said: We, at this meeting, with deep excitement, pay tribute to the peoples who have suffered from the wars created by the imperialists. We want to pay tribute to the Korean delegation, to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, and to the delegations of Vietnam and Malaya. Guchi pointed out that the people of Algeria and the people of Vietnam are united. Although the Algerian dockworkers have extremely difficult material lives, they have been refusing to load French ships heading to Vietnam for five years. The mothers of Algeria demand the return of their sons who were deceived into joining the French aggressive army in Vietnam by violence or tricks. Our farmers drove away the imperialist agents who recruited soldiers for the Vietnam War. Our people believe that their struggle against the Vietnam War is a contribution to the entire struggle for the defense of peace. Guchi then condemned the French imperialists for intensifying the suppression of the Algerian national movement with the support of the US imperialists. He pointed out that the Algerian people have united to oppose the policies of oppression and war. Finally, amidst the passionate enthusiasm of the entire venue, Guchi made a solemn oath: The Algerian people unanimously swear never to be allies of the imperialist oppressors, and never to fight against the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the people of all countries.

As Guchi walked back to his seat after his speech, Ngo Gia Kham, an outstanding labor model from Vietnam, stepped forward and shook his hand. Uncontrollable enthusiasm moved the representatives of these two nations, who were opposing the same enemy - French imperialism - to embrace each other. The whole venue applauded warmly for this touching fraternal friendship.

Ghulam Muhammad Khan, Vice Chairman of the Pakistan Peace Committee, spoke next. He first pointed out the great significance of the peace conference for maintaining peace in the Asia and Pacific regions. Ghulam condemned the US military for conducting bacteriological warfare, saying: Peaceful residents on the border between North Korea and China are being mercilessly massacred by vicious weapons and germ bombs. He assured the representatives of all countries on behalf of the 80 million people of Pakistan that the Pakistani people are with you in jointly committing to the cause of peace and are prepared to defend the cause of peace at any cost. He said: Pakistan desperately needs a long period of uninterrupted peace to move towards social, industrial, and economic progress. He expressed great satisfaction with the friendly contact between the Indian and Pakistani peace delegations in Beijing and praised the great progress of New China on the road to freedom, peace, and prosperity. Finally, Ghulam exclaimed "Long live peace, long live free and prosperous Asia," ending his speech amidst warm applause.

After a short break, the meeting continued under the chairmanship of Ataur Rahman, a representative from Pakistan.

Amador, a representative of the people of Honduras, said: The economic, social, and political situation of the people of Honduras today - the tragic situation of dependent countries and oppressed people - compels us to embark on the path of pursuing hope. The people of Honduras know that the only way for them and all enslaved people to achieve national liberation is to win and maintain world peace and the friendship of the people of all countries, just like the fraternal friendship shown at our great meeting. Amador described the political and economic control of Honduras by the United States, and said: We are able to fight against war preparations, and we will not let a single Honduran shed a drop of blood for the cause of crime and death. Amador passionately conveyed the friendly feelings of the peace advocates of Honduras to the Chinese people and said to all representatives: Let us burn war in the flame of everlasting friendship.

Mrs. Wilcox, a white-haired American representative in her sixties, spoke on behalf of the peace-loving people of the United States and was received with extremely warm welcome. She said that 70 percent of the American people had requested an immediate end to the Korean War in opinion polls. She then sternly condemned the barbaric acts of the US armed forces in using napalm bombs and bacteriological weapons to massacre the Korean people and massacre prisoners of war, as well as the US government's acts of occupying Taiwan, reviving Japanese and German militarism, and exerting economic exploitation and political pressure on Latin American countries. She pointed out: Although the propaganda machines of the United States have caused ideological confusion among the American people through rumors and distortions, the peace movement is still developing day by day, and the organization of the peace movement has developed to more than 3,000, including people from various fields of society. The attempt by the US ruling group to pass a bill on universal military training in peacetime in Congress has been shattered by the people's protests. Finally, Mrs. Wilcox firmly declared: The American people hate the Korean War, and we know it is unjust. We want peace, an immediate realization of peace. After her speech, all the representatives expressed their great welcome to the American people's will to demand peace.

The next speaker was Valdo Chávez Velasco, a representative from El Salvador. Based on the personal suffering of the Latin American people from enslavement, he condemned the colonial system. He suggested condemning the colonial system in the conference's declaration. He also said: We have received telegrams informing us that the government of El Salvador, under the pretext of the convening of the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, has thrown 1,200 peace fighters in our country into prison, and in fact, they want to prevent the possible impact of this conference on people's minds in advance. This incident shows what the governments of Latin America fostered by the US State Department can do. He emphasized that the people love peace, and history will punish the criminals. Finally, on behalf of the El Salvador delegation, he requested those attending the peace conference to protest against the government of El Salvador and support the people who are suffering in the struggle for peace.

After Valdo Chávez Velasco finished his speech, Hai, Deputy Secretary-General of the Peace Conference, stood up and presented a draft of a protest telegram to the government of El Salvador. All the representatives unanimously applauded and passed the protest telegram.

Finally, Deputy Secretary-General Hai announced that the conference had received congratulatory messages from three international trade union organizations, including the International Federation of Teachers' Unions.

The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.

    【本报讯】据新华社讯：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第六日会议在七日下午三时二十分继续进行。下午会议的执行主席是：格莱丝·奈特夫人（加拿大），顿·菲立普·古纳瓦地尼（锡兰），贺捷耶夫（苏联），拉法尔·洛培斯·马洛（墨西哥），拉苏娜·萨依特（印尼）。
    会议在执行主席、加拿大联合教会工作者格莱丝·奈特夫人主持下进行。副秘书长哈伊宣布：出席会议的代表正在继续到达。现在到会的已经有三十七国的代表三百六十一人，列席代表三十七人；以及国际组织的代表和特邀的列席代表等共四百一十八人。
    下午会议听取了国际学生联合会副主席艾切伐里亚的发言，以及日本、印度、朝鲜、新西兰、苏联、澳大利亚、缅甸和哥斯达黎加八个国家的代表的发言。代表们的发言充分显示各国人民对和平的热爱。当日本、朝鲜、缅甸等国的代表谈到各国人民反对复活日本军国主义、要求建立和平、民主的日本的时候，全场一再响起雷般的掌声。
    会议开始后，主席首先请国际学生联合会副主席艾切伐里亚讲话。他以代表七十二个国家五百三十多万学生的国际学联的名义，向全体与会者致敬。他指出：殖民制度是民主教育的死敌，殖民地和附属国学生的情况特别严重，学习、生活、卫生情况十分恶劣。这些地区的学生在争取民族独立与和平的斗争中，起着重要的作用。因为他们知道，只有消灭了殖民制度，学生的情况才能够同时得到改善。他宣布：国际学联将在明年夏天召开第三届世界学生大会，亚洲及太平洋区域的学生，尤其应该利用大会的准备工作来推进为和平与民族独立而斗争的工作，并加强与世界各地学生的团结友好的联系。他最后说：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议所产生的决议，将帮助这个地区的学生对世界和平事业起更大的作用。

    日本代表团团员、日本青年祖国战线代表小仓金吉发言，报告日本青年的痛苦和斗争的情况。他指出，美国占领当局正使日本青年、妇女和学生遭到极大的灾难和侮辱。美国军队正在搜罗日本青年做雇佣兵。但是，日本人民绝不允许这种凶恶的阴谋得逞。“日本青年再不拿起枪来与亚洲的兄弟作战”、“妇女们再不要把丈夫、儿子和爱人送到战场上去”，已经成为全日本青年和母亲们的共同口号。日本全国目前正在展开反对军国主义复活和反对征兵的签名运动。小仓金吉的发言表示出日本青年反对战争的坚强决心，受到全场热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    印度代表团团员、前北方省政府驻国会秘书、现任北方省立法议会议员高文德·萨海登台发言。他说：旧金山“对日和约”和“美日安全条约”使日本丧失了主权，违反了使日本和一切太平洋沿岸国家保持友好关系的基本和平要求。这是美国推行战争计划的措施。印度人民支持日本人民，反对这两个条约，并认为应以有一切有关国家来签订的真正和约来代替。这个和约应规定一切外国军队自日本撤退，任何外国不得在日本建立军事基地，日本人民应享有完整的主权。萨海说：印度的和平运动正在发展，这次有六十多个代表来参加会议，说明我们国家里已经产生了对和平运动的热情。萨海强调指出印度代表团这次有机会在北京会晤巴基斯坦的弟兄，来讨论增进两国间和平友谊，这是印度和巴基斯坦的和平运动所要作的重要工作。
    朝鲜代表团副团长、朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会委员郑圣彦接着发言，专门讨论日本问题。

    会议在休息后于五时三十分继续进行，由执行主席、锡兰代表团团员、新闻工作者顿·菲立普·古纳瓦地尼主持。
    苏联代表，苏联乌兹别克共和国和平委员会主席贺捷耶夫在热烈掌声中登台发言。他代表苏联乌兹别克共和国人民向各国代表敬礼，并指出苏联人民坚决反对帝国主义者的冒险举动，主张用和平方法解决一切争端。贺捷耶夫表示拥护郭沫若报告中所提出的保卫和平的行动纲领。他详细叙述了苏联乌兹别克人民的经济生活及文化生活在苏维埃政权建立后飞跃发展的情形。他说：阳光普照、欣欣向荣的苏联乌兹别克的人民，今后还要和苏联各族人民及各国人民一道，积极为崇高的世界和平事业而斗争。

    缅甸代表团秘书、克伦族大会副主席苏波登（前译马·坡登）在会上的发言，表达了曾身受日本法西斯恐怖的痛苦的缅甸人民对日本问题的意见。苏波登说：缅甸人民从切身的经验中体会到“大东亚共荣圈”对他们就意味着血汗与眼泪，但缅甸人民又听到原来的日本法西斯分子重又喊出“大东亚地带”。苏波登指出美帝国主义和它的日本走狗叫嚣着重新武装日本，这就意味着痛苦又有重新来临的危险，甚至还要严重。苏波登表示缅甸人民对日本人民的同情，他说：我们决心和日本人民团结一致，反对美帝国主义的干涉、占领和奴役。苏波登代表缅甸代表团支持郭沫若和日本代表提出的关于日本问题的建议，并表示希望亚洲及太平洋各国人民与日本人民之间能有具体的合作方式。各国人民应该用一切可能的方式，支持日本人民争取独立、和平与民主的斗争。
    哥斯达黎加代表、数学教授维塔尔·穆里洛以天主教徒的身份，接着发言。

    【新华社八日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第七日会议在八日上午九时二十分开始举行。会议上有九个代表发言，他们有的来自东南亚，有的来自中东，有的来自拉丁美洲，有的来自美国，还有的来自遥远的非洲北部的法国殖民地——阿尔及利亚。这些来自不同国度的代表，都向大会表示了本国人民的和平愿望。他们的发言使人深深感到那些为民族独立而斗争的人民争取和平的坚定决心。他们的发言都受到各国和平战士的热烈的欢迎。
    会议的执行主席是：徐春植（朝鲜），阿陶尔·拉赫曼（巴基斯坦），拉维·山加尔·史佛兰姆·维亚斯（印度），路易·艾黎（新西兰），阮春水（越南）。
    执行主席、朝鲜代表徐春植宣布会议开始后，首先由叙利亚和黎巴嫩代表阿姆德·喀萨尔发言。
    阿姆德·喀萨尔指出：为保卫和平与民族独立而斗争着的叙利亚和黎巴嫩人民，广泛地支持这个有历史意义的和平会议。因为这次会议对于和平解决日本问题、制止朝鲜战争、禁止细菌武器，将有极大的贡献。他接着叙述了叙利亚和黎巴嫩的人民反对以侵略为目的的中东司令部和要求停止朝鲜战争、抗议美国政府进行细菌战、要求五大国缔结和平公约的斗争情形。他指出：尽管军事独裁政权对和平运动进行了野蛮的镇压，但是叙利亚和黎巴嫩的人民并没有低头，他们知道在争取和平与民族独立的斗争中，亚洲及太平洋区域的兄弟们，伟大的苏联和人民中国，是和他们在一起的。他高呼：觉醒过来的阿拉伯各族人民不再酣睡了，在没有获得和平自由与民族独立之前，他们决不能高枕无忧。
    披着黄袍的锡兰代表团团长、在锡兰享有社会声望的那拉威拉·达马拉塔纳法师，上台发言时受到热烈欢迎。他首先兴奋地宣布：锡兰政府的贸易代表团最近已经和中国签订了一个平等互利的贸易协定，中国供给锡兰所迫切需要的大米八万吨，锡兰政府也保证给予中国在锡兰购买橡胶的便利。他说：如果亚洲及太平洋各国都能够进行这样的平等互利的贸易，那将使我们这个区域和全世界得到安定与和平。他的发言立刻引起各国代表们一致的兴奋的掌声。
    达马拉塔纳法师在发言中又指出：锡兰人民长期遭受被外国压迫者踩在脚底下的痛苦，而现在，由于锡兰在印度洋中的重要战略地位，它的基地和港口正被帝国主义用来进行军事侵略活动，它的矿产被运去制造原子武器。同时，美国压低橡胶价格和强迫禁运，给锡兰的经济造成了严重后果。只是在中国购买锡兰的橡胶以后，锡兰才避免了橡胶价格的全部崩溃。他说：锡兰的粮食有三分之二要依靠进口，只有和平，锡兰才能得到每天的粮食。锡兰人民急切希望采取一切可能的步骤，制止战争贩子在朝鲜、越南、马来亚，特别是在日本的罪恶行为。达马拉塔纳法师说：我们回国以后，将用全力把我们的和平运动变成真正的群众运动。他说：仍然在为着自由而斗争的亚洲各国人民，都在用羡慕和感激的目光注视着伟大的中国人民所树立的榜样。他的发言得到热烈的响应。
    泰国代表?素里·通哇匿在发言中指出由于泰国有丰富的资源，又处于战略要地，美国就不惜采取各种手段将泰国变成它发动侵略战争的基地。他并指出美国的这种行为威胁了亚洲的和平，损害了泰国的独立自主。?素里·通哇匿斥责美国复活日本军国主义作为侵略亚洲的工具，和美国军队野蛮地在朝鲜进行细菌战的罪行。他说：泰国政府派遣军队往朝鲜与美军一同作战，许多泰国士兵已变成炮灰。停止朝鲜战争，撤回泰国军队，这是泰国人民一致的要求。禁运货物往人民民主国家已使泰国人民受到困苦，自从泰国参加“禁运”以来，橡胶价格已降低了百分之六十以上。泰国人民要求废除“禁运”，需要有贸易的自由。?素里·通哇匿指出美国的控制和泰国政府推行扩军备战政策是造成泰国人民一切困苦的根源。他坚定地宣称：为了民族独立、为了自由幸福的生活，泰国人民的出路就是和亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民团结起来，与侵略者进行斗争。
    ?素里·通哇匿发言后，泰国代表团携带着鲜花和一面绣有和平鸽的绿色锦旗走上主席台，献给战斗中的朝鲜英雄人民的代表，激动地和朝鲜代表们拥抱起来。在雷动的掌声中，?素里·过哇匿宣读了泰国代表团的献词，献词说：“我们泰国代表团全体团员，向派有代表出席这次和平会议的朝鲜兄弟们致真挚的敬礼！泰国政府是亚洲第一个派遣军队参加侵略朝鲜的政府，但是，这是泰国政府的事，它并不是泰国人民的意愿。我们要在这里坚决地声言：我们——泰国人民曾经不断地阻止这种不正义的行动并反对在朝鲜的暴行。我们同时还要声明，泰国人民非常热爱和同情朝鲜兄弟，泰国人民正在进行斗争，使泰国政府撤回在朝鲜的军队。”这个庄严的声明，又一次引起暴风雨般的掌声。
    尼加拉瓜代表团团长、心理学家瓦拉达勒斯接着发言。他首先向出席会议的各国代表和中国人民表示敬意，并表示热诚支援朝鲜、越南、马来亚和寮国人民反对帝国主义侵略的英勇斗争。他指出：由于尼加拉瓜政府执行准备战争的政策，全国人民目前正遭遇到严重的经济危机。尼加拉瓜政府企图派遣青年去参加侵略朝鲜的战争，但这个意图立即被各阶层人民拒绝了。瓦拉达勒斯说：尼加拉瓜人民在共和国成立以来的历史上曾三次遭遇外国占领的恐怖。美国军队曾经杀害和劫掠过我们的人民。我们重申：我们决心要为我国的和平而战斗。尽管我们的处境非常困难，我们仍然要这样做。虽然我们国土很小，但是我们一定能够尽我们的一分力量使各国之间获致和平的谅解。
    正在为民族独立而英勇斗争的阿尔及利亚人民所派的列席代表顾奇·摩罕默德，在热烈的掌声中走上讲台。顾奇说：我们在这个会议上，怀着深深激动的心情，向那些身受帝国主义者制造的战争之苦的人民致敬。我们要向朝鲜代表团、向英勇的中国人民志愿军，并向越南和马来亚的代表团致敬。顾奇指出：阿尔及利亚的人民和越南人民是团结一心的，阿尔及利亚的码头工人虽然物质生活极为困苦，但是五年以来，他们一直拒绝给开往越南的法国船装货。阿尔及利亚的母亲要求送回被用暴力或诡计骗到越南去参加法国侵略军的儿子。我国农民赶走了为越南战争招兵的帝国主义代理人。我国人民认为，他们反对越南战争的斗争，是对整个保卫和平斗争的贡献。顾奇接着谴责法帝国主义者在美帝国主义者的支持下，对阿尔及利亚民族运动加强镇压的行为。他指出阿尔及利亚人民已团结起来反对压迫和战争的政策。顾奇最后在全场激昂的热情中发出庄严的誓言说：阿尔及利亚人民一致宣誓决不作帝国主义压迫者的同盟，决不对苏联、对人民民主国家和各国人民作战。
    顾奇在发言后走回他的席次时，越南杰出的劳动模范吴嘉嵌上前和他握手。不能抑制的热情，使这两个正在反对着同一个敌人——法国帝国主义的民族的代表激动地拥抱在一起。全场都为这种感人的兄弟般的战斗友谊热烈鼓掌。
    巴基斯坦和平委员会副主席吴拉姆·穆罕默德·汗接着发言。他首先指出和平会议对于维护亚洲及太平洋区域和平的重大意义。吴拉姆斥责美国军队进行细菌战说：北朝鲜和中国边界的和平居民，正遭受着恶毒的武器和细菌炸弹的无情屠杀。他代表巴基斯坦人民向各国代表保证说：八千万巴基斯坦人民和你们在一起共同致力于和平事业，并准备不惜任何代价来保卫和平事业。他说：巴基斯坦非常需要长时期的、不受干扰的和平，以走向社会、工业和经济的进步。他对印度和巴基斯坦和平代表团在北京的友好接触极感满意，并盛赞新中国在自由、和平和繁荣的道路的巨大进步。吴拉姆最后高呼“和平万岁，自由繁荣的亚洲万岁”，在热烈掌声中结束了他的发言。
    会议在短时间的休息后，在执行主席、巴基斯坦代表阿陶尔·拉赫曼主持下继续进行。
    洪都拉斯人民的代表阿马多尔发言说：洪都拉斯人民今天的经济、社会和政治情况——就是附属国和被压迫人民的可悲的情况，使我们不得不走上追求希望的道路。洪都拉斯人民知道他们和一切被奴役的人民要获得民族解放，唯一的方法就是要赢得并维护世界和平和各国人民的友好，就如在我们这个伟大的会议上所表现的兄弟友好一样。阿马多尔叙述了美国在政治、经济上控制洪都拉斯的情形，并且说：我们是能够和战争准备作斗争的，我们不使一个洪都拉斯人民为犯罪和死亡的事业流一滴血。阿马多尔热情地传达了洪都拉斯和平拥护者对中国人民的友好感情，并向全体代表说：让我们在永远不衰的友谊的火焰中把战争烧毁。
    头发银白的六十多岁的美国代表维尔科克斯夫人，代表美国和平人民上台讲话，受到极热烈的欢迎。她说，百分之七十的美国人民曾在民意测验中要求立即停止朝鲜战争。她接着严正地谴责美国武装部队使用凝固汽油弹、细菌武器屠杀朝鲜人民以及屠杀战俘的野蛮行为，及美国政府侵占台湾、复活日、德军国主义、对拉丁美洲各国施行经济剥削和政治压力等行为。她指出：尽管美国的许多宣传机器的造谣和歪曲在美国人民中造成了思想混乱，但是和平运动仍在日益开展，和平运动的组织已发展到三千个以上，其中包括社会中各个不同领域的人。美国统治集团要在国会里通过实行和平时期普遍军训法案的企图，已因人民的群起抗议而被粉碎了。维尔科克斯夫人最后坚定地宣称：美国人民憎恨朝鲜战争，我们知道那是非正义的。我们要和平，立刻实现和平。发言毕，全体代表对于美国人民要求和平的意志，表示极大的欢迎。
    接着发言的是萨尔瓦多代表瓦尔多·查维斯·维拉斯科。他根据拉丁美洲人民遭受奴役的切身苦痛，谴责殖民制度。他建议在会议的宣言中谴责殖民制度。他又说：我们接到电报，知道萨尔瓦多政府以亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开为藉口，把我国一千二百位和平战士投入监狱，而实际上是想事先防止这次会议对人民思想上可能发生的影响。这件事使人看到：美国国务院所扶植起来的拉丁美洲的政府可以干出什么勾当来。他强调说，但是，人民是爱好和平的，历史将会给罪犯以惩罚。他最后代表萨尔瓦多代表团要求出席和平会议的人士对萨尔瓦多政府提出抗议，支持在争取和平的斗争中受到痛苦的人民。
    瓦尔多·查维斯·维拉斯科发言毕，和平会议副秘书长哈伊起立提出了致萨尔瓦多政府的抗议电的草稿。全体代表一致鼓掌通过了这个抗议电。
    最后，副秘书长哈伊宣布大会收到教育工作者工会国际等三个国际工会组织的贺电。
    会议在上午十二时休会。
