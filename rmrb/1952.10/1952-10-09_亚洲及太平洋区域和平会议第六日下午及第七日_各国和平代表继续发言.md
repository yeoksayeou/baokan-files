Xinhua News Agency Report: The sixth day of the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference continued on the afternoon of the seventh at 3:20 PM. The executive chairpersons of the afternoon meeting were: Mrs. Grace Knight (Canada), Don Philip Gunawardena (Ceylon), Hegayev (Soviet Union), Rafael LÃ³pez Malo (Mexico), Rasuna Said (Indonesia).

The meeting proceeded under the chairmanship of Grace Knight, a worker in the United Church of Canada. Deputy Secretary-General Hai announced that representatives attending the conference were continuing to arrive. Currently, there were 361 representatives from 37 countries, 37 observers, and representatives from international organizations and specially invited observers, totaling 418 people.

The afternoon meeting heard speeches from Echeverria, Vice President of the International Union of Students, and representatives from Japan, India, Korea, New Zealand, the Soviet Union, Australia, Burma, and Costa Rica. The representatives' speeches fully demonstrated the love of peace among the people of various countries. When representatives from Japan, Korea, Burma, and other countries spoke about their people's opposition to the revival of Japanese militarism and their demand for the establishment of a peaceful and democratic Japan, the whole venue repeatedly erupted in thunderous applause.

After the meeting began, the chair first invited Echeverria, Vice President of the International Union of Students, to speak. On behalf of the International Union of Students, representing 5.3 million students from 72 countries, he paid tribute to all attendees. He pointed out that the colonial system was the mortal enemy of democratic education, and the situation of students in colonies and dependent countries was particularly serious, with extremely poor learning, living, and sanitary conditions. Students in these regions played an important role in the struggle for national independence and peace because they knew that only by eliminating the colonial system could the situation of students be improved simultaneously. He announced that the International Union of Students would convene the Third World Student Congress next summer, and students in the Asia and Pacific regions, in particular, should use the preparations for the congress to promote the work of struggling for peace and national independence and strengthen friendly ties with students around the world. He concluded by saying that the resolutions produced by the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference would help students in this region play a greater role in the cause of world peace.

After his speech, Echeverria, on behalf of the International Union of Students, presented the China Peace Committee with a carved glass bottle, expressing the respect of students from all countries for the great Chinese people. When the gift was presented, the whole venue stood up and applauded for a long time.

Ogura Kinji, a member of the Japanese delegation and a representative of the Japan Youth Homeland Front, spoke about the suffering and struggle of Japanese youth. He pointed out that the American occupation authorities were causing extreme disaster and humiliation to Japanese youth, women, and students. The American army was recruiting Japanese youth as mercenaries. However, the Japanese people would never allow this heinous conspiracy to succeed. "Japanese youth will no longer take up guns to fight against their Asian brothers" and "Women will no longer send their husbands, sons, and loved ones to the battlefield" had become the common slogans of all Japanese youth and mothers. A signature campaign against the revival of militarism and conscription was currently underway throughout Japan. Ogura Kinji's speech expressed the firm determination of Japanese youth to oppose war and was warmly welcomed by the whole venue with thunderous applause.

Govind Sahai, a member of the Indian delegation, former Parliamentary Secretary of the Northern Province Government, and currently a member of the Northern Province Legislative Assembly, took the stage to speak. He said that the San Francisco "Peace Treaty with Japan" and the "US-Japan Security Treaty" deprived Japan of its sovereignty and violated the basic peaceful requirement of maintaining friendly relations between Japan and all Pacific coastal countries. This was a measure taken by the United States to promote its war plans. The Indian people supported the Japanese people in opposing these two treaties and believed that they should be replaced by a genuine treaty signed by all relevant countries. This treaty should stipulate the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Japan, prohibit any foreign country from establishing military bases in Japan, and ensure that the Japanese people enjoy complete sovereignty. Sahai said that the peace movement in India was developing, and the fact that more than sixty representatives came to participate in the conference showed that enthusiasm for the peace movement had arisen in our country. Sahai emphasized that the opportunity for the Indian delegation to meet with their Pakistani brothers in Beijing to discuss enhancing peaceful friendship between the two countries was an important task for the peace movements in India and Pakistan.

Jeong Seong-yeon, Deputy Head of the Korean Delegation and a member of the Korean National Committee for the Defence of Peace, then spoke, focusing on the Japanese issue.

Montague, Head of the New Zealand Delegation and National Secretary of the New Zealand Peace Council, spoke next.

After Montague's speech, fifty-four representatives from more than thirty ethnic groups in China, including Mongolians, Tibetans, Manchus, Huis, Miaos, Yaos, Yis, Sanis, Dais, Zhuangs, and Gaoshans, wearing brightly colored national costumes and carrying the love and respect of all Chinese ethnic groups for the conference, entered the venue to music. They presented hadas and flowers to the presidium. Then, representatives of Muslims in Beijing presented the conference with a huge red banner more than a zhang long. During the presentation of gifts and banners, the venue erupted in prolonged applause, fully demonstrating the close unity between peace fighters from Asian and Pacific countries and the Chinese people.

After a break, the meeting continued at 5:30 PM, chaired by Don Philip Gunawardena, a member of the Ceylon delegation and a journalist.

Hegayev, a Soviet representative and Chairman of the Peace Committee of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, took the stage to speak amidst warm applause. He extended greetings to representatives from all countries on behalf of the people of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and pointed out that the Soviet people firmly opposed the adventurous actions of the imperialists and advocated peaceful methods to resolve all disputes. Hegayev expressed his support for the program of action for defending peace proposed in Guo Moruo's report. He described in detail the rapid development of the economic and cultural lives of the people of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic after the establishment of the Soviet regime. He said that the people of the sunny and prosperous Soviet Uzbekistan would continue to work actively with the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union and the people of all countries for the noble cause of world peace.

The speech by Mrs. Ralph, an Australian representative who had lived and worked in China for thirty-five years, vividly and kindly expressed the firm will of good people to strive for peace, and was warmly welcomed by the whole venue. When Mrs. Ralph solemnly declared that they were about to leave China to return to their country to continue their peace work in response to an urgent call, the venue resounded with prolonged applause. Her simple and moving speech was warmly welcomed by the whole venue. The attendees all stood up and applauded for a long time.

Su Po Dun (formerly translated as Ma Po Deng), Secretary of the Burmese Delegation and Vice Chairman of the Karen National Congress, expressed the views of the Burmese people, who had personally suffered the horrors of Japanese fascism, on the Japanese issue. Su Po Dun said that the Burmese people had learned from their own experience that the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" meant blood, sweat, and tears for them, but the Burmese people had also heard the original Japanese fascists shouting out "Greater East Asia Zone" again. Su Po Dun pointed out that American imperialism and its Japanese lackeys were clamoring for the rearmament of Japan, which meant that the danger of suffering was about to recur, even more seriously. Su Po Dun expressed the sympathy of the Burmese people for the Japanese people. He said: We are determined to unite with the Japanese people to oppose the interference, occupation, and enslavement of American imperialism. Su Po Dun, on behalf of the Burmese delegation, supported the proposals on the Japanese issue put forward by Guo Moruo and the Japanese representatives and expressed the hope that there could be concrete ways of cooperation between the people of Asian and Pacific countries and the Japanese people. The people of all countries should support the struggle of the Japanese people for independence, peace, and democracy in every possible way.

Vital Murillo, a Costa Rican representative and mathematics professor, then spoke as a Catholic.

Next, Deputy Secretary-General Hai announced that the conference had received congratulatory messages from the following organizations and individuals: the Lao Free National United Front, the American Peace Crusaders, the Albanian National Peace Committee, the Red Cross Society of China, the Connecticut Peace Committee of the United States, the Youth Peace and Friendship Council of Northern California, the Swedish Mr. Flormonto, the West Finland Peace Committee, the Esperanto Peace Committee of Denmark, and Mr. Rene of Belgium.

The meeting adjourned amidst applause after announcing the program for tomorrow.

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: The seventh day of the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference began at 9:20 AM on the 8th. Nine representatives spoke at the meeting, some from Southeast Asia, some from the Middle East, some from Latin America, some from the United States, and some from the French colony of Algeria in distant North Africa. These representatives from different countries all expressed the peace wishes of their people to the conference. Their speeches deeply impressed people with the firm determination of those fighting for national independence to strive for peace. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by peace fighters from all countries.

The executive chairpersons of the meeting were: Xu Chunzhi (Korea), Ataur Rahman (Pakistan), Ravi Shankar Shivram Vyas (India), Louis Alley (New Zealand), Nguyen Xuan Thuy (Vietnam).

After the executive chairperson, Korean representative Xu Chunzhi, announced the start of the meeting, Ahmed Kassal, a representative from Syria and Lebanon, spoke first.

Ahmed Kassal pointed out that the people of Syria and Lebanon, who are fighting to defend peace and national independence, broadly support this historically significant peace conference. Because this conference will make a great contribution to the peaceful resolution of the Japanese issue, the cessation of the Korean War, and the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. He then described the struggle of the people of Syria and Lebanon against the Middle East Command, which aims at aggression, demanding a stop to the Korean War, protesting against the US government's bacteriological warfare, and demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. He pointed out that although the military dictatorship had carried out brutal suppression of the peace movement, the people of Syria and Lebanon had not bowed their heads. They knew that in the struggle for peace and national independence, their brothers in the Asia and Pacific regions, the great Soviet Union, and the People's China were with them. He exclaimed: The awakened Arab peoples are no longer asleep. They will not rest easy until they have achieved peace, freedom, and national independence.

Narawila Dhammaratana, the head of the Ceylonese delegation, wearing a yellow robe and enjoying social prestige in Ceylon, was warmly welcomed when he took the stage to speak. He excitedly announced that the Ceylonese government's trade delegation had recently signed an equal and mutually beneficial trade agreement with China, with China supplying Ceylon with 80,000 tons of much-needed rice, and the Ceylonese government guaranteeing China the convenience of purchasing rubber in Ceylon. He said that if Asian and Pacific countries could conduct such equal and mutually beneficial trade, it would bring stability and peace to our region and the world. His speech immediately caused unanimous and excited applause from representatives of all countries.

In his speech, Dhammaratana also pointed out that the people of Ceylon had long suffered the pain of being trampled underfoot by foreign oppressors. Now, due to Ceylon's important strategic position in the Indian Ocean, its bases and ports were being used by imperialists to carry out military aggression, and its minerals were being shipped away to manufacture atomic weapons. At the same time, the United States' lowering of rubber prices and forced embargo had caused serious consequences for Ceylon's economy. Only after China bought Ceylon's rubber did Ceylon avoid a total collapse in rubber prices. He said that Ceylon had to rely on imports for two-thirds of its food, and only peace could bring Ceylon daily food. The people of Ceylon urgently hoped to take all possible steps to stop the war-mongers' heinous acts in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and especially in Japan. Dhammaratana said: After we return home, we will do our best to turn our peace movement into a genuine mass movement. He said: The people of Asian countries who are still fighting for freedom are watching the example set by the great Chinese people with envious and grateful eyes. His speech received a warm response.

Suri Tongwanit, a Thai representative, pointed out in his speech that because Thailand has abundant resources and is in a strategic location, the United States has spared no effort to turn Thailand into a base for launching aggressive wars. He also pointed out that this behavior of the United States threatened peace in Asia and damaged Thailand's independence and autonomy. Suri Tongwanit condemned the United States for reviving Japanese militarism as a tool for aggression against Asia, and the US military's barbaric crimes of conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea. He said: The Thai government has sent troops to Korea to fight alongside the US military, and many Thai soldiers have become cannon fodder. Stopping the Korean War and withdrawing Thai troops is the unanimous demand of the Thai people. The embargo on goods to people's democratic countries has caused hardship for the Thai people. Since Thailand joined the "embargo," rubber prices have fallen by more than 60 percent. The Thai people demand the abolition of the "embargo" and need freedom of trade. Suri Tongwanit pointed out that American control and the Thai government's policy of promoting military expansion and war preparation are the root causes of all the hardships of the Thai people. He firmly declared: For national independence and for a free and happy life, the way out for the Thai people is to unite with the 1.6 billion people in the Asia and Pacific regions and fight against the aggressors.

After Suri Tongwanit spoke, the Thai delegation, carrying flowers and a green banner embroidered with a dove of peace, walked to the podium, presented it to the representatives of the heroic Korean people in battle, and embraced the Korean representatives excitedly. Amid thunderous applause, Suri Tongwanit read out the dedication of the Thai delegation, which said: "We, the entire members of the Thai delegation, extend our sincere respects to our Korean brothers who have sent representatives to this peace conference! The Thai government was the first government in Asia to send troops to participate in the aggression against Korea, but this is the matter of the Thai government, it is not the will of the Thai people. We want to firmly declare here: We - the Thai people have been constantly preventing this unjust action and opposing the atrocities in Korea. We also want to declare that the Thai people love and sympathize with their Korean brothers very much. The Thai people are fighting to make the Thai government withdraw its troops in Korea." This solemn statement once again aroused a storm of applause.

Valadares, the head of the Nicaraguan delegation and a psychologist, spoke next. He first expressed his respect to the representatives of all countries attending the conference and to the Chinese people, and expressed his enthusiastic support for the heroic struggle of the people of Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and Laos against imperialist aggression. He pointed out that due to the Nicaraguan government's policy of preparing for war, the people of the whole country are currently encountering a serious economic crisis. The Nicaraguan government attempted to send young people to participate in the aggressive war against Korea, but this intention was immediately rejected by people of all walks of life. Valadares said: In the history of the republic since its founding, the Nicaraguan people have encountered the terror of foreign occupation three times. American troops have killed and plundered our people. We reiterate our determination to fight for the peace of our country. Although our situation is very difficult, we must still do so. Although our country is small, we will certainly be able to do our part to achieve peaceful understanding between countries.

Guchi Mohammed, an observer representing the Algerian people who are bravely fighting for national independence, walked onto the stage amidst warm applause. Guchi said: We, at this meeting, with deep excitement, pay tribute to the peoples who have suffered from the wars created by the imperialists. We want to pay tribute to the Korean delegation, to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, and to the delegations of Vietnam and Malaya. Guchi pointed out that the people of Algeria and the people of Vietnam are united. Although the Algerian dockworkers have extremely difficult material lives, they have been refusing to load French ships heading to Vietnam for five years. The mothers of Algeria demand the return of their sons who were deceived into joining the French aggressive army in Vietnam by violence or tricks. Our farmers drove away the imperialist agents who recruited soldiers for the Vietnam War. Our people believe that their struggle against the Vietnam War is a contribution to the entire struggle for the defense of peace. Guchi then condemned the French imperialists for intensifying the suppression of the Algerian national movement with the support of the US imperialists. He pointed out that the Algerian people have united to oppose the policies of oppression and war. Finally, amidst the passionate enthusiasm of the entire venue, Guchi made a solemn oath: The Algerian people unanimously swear never to be allies of the imperialist oppressors, and never to fight against the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the people of all countries.

As Guchi walked back to his seat after his speech, Ngo Gia Kham, an outstanding labor model from Vietnam, stepped forward and shook his hand. Uncontrollable enthusiasm moved the representatives of these two nations, who were opposing the same enemy - French imperialism - to embrace each other. The whole venue applauded warmly for this touching fraternal friendship.

Ghulam Muhammad Khan, Vice Chairman of the Pakistan Peace Committee, spoke next. He first pointed out the great significance of the peace conference for maintaining peace in the Asia and Pacific regions. Ghulam condemned the US military for conducting bacteriological warfare, saying: Peaceful residents on the border between North Korea and China are being mercilessly massacred by vicious weapons and germ bombs. He assured the representatives of all countries on behalf of the 80 million people of Pakistan that the Pakistani people are with you in jointly committing to the cause of peace and are prepared to defend the cause of peace at any cost. He said: Pakistan desperately needs a long period of uninterrupted peace to move towards social, industrial, and economic progress. He expressed great satisfaction with the friendly contact between the Indian and Pakistani peace delegations in Beijing and praised the great progress of New China on the road to freedom, peace, and prosperity. Finally, Ghulam exclaimed "Long live peace, long live free and prosperous Asia," ending his speech amidst warm applause.

After a short break, the meeting continued under the chairmanship of Ataur Rahman, a representative from Pakistan.

Amador, a representative of the people of Honduras, said: The economic, social, and political situation of the people of Honduras today - the tragic situation of dependent countries and oppressed people - compels us to embark on the path of pursuing hope. The people of Honduras know that the only way for them and all enslaved people to achieve national liberation is to win and maintain world peace and the friendship of the people of all countries, just like the fraternal friendship shown at our great meeting. Amador described the political and economic control of Honduras by the United States, and said: We are able to fight against war preparations, and we will not let a single Honduran shed a drop of blood for the cause of crime and death. Amador passionately conveyed the friendly feelings of the peace advocates of Honduras to the Chinese people and said to all representatives: Let us burn war in the flame of everlasting friendship.

Mrs. Wilcox, a white-haired American representative in her sixties, spoke on behalf of the peace-loving people of the United States and was received with extremely warm welcome. She said that 70 percent of the American people had requested an immediate end to the Korean War in opinion polls. She then sternly condemned the barbaric acts of the US armed forces in using napalm bombs and bacteriological weapons to massacre the Korean people and massacre prisoners of war, as well as the US government's acts of occupying Taiwan, reviving Japanese and German militarism, and exerting economic exploitation and political pressure on Latin American countries. She pointed out: Although the propaganda machines of the United States have caused ideological confusion among the American people through rumors and distortions, the peace movement is still developing day by day, and the organization of the peace movement has developed to more than 3,000, including people from various fields of society. The attempt by the US ruling group to pass a bill on universal military training in peacetime in Congress has been shattered by the people's protests. Finally, Mrs. Wilcox firmly declared: The American people hate the Korean War, and we know it is unjust. We want peace, an immediate realization of peace. After her speech, all the representatives expressed their great welcome to the American people's will to demand peace.

The next speaker was Valdo ChÃ¡vez Velasco, a representative from El Salvador. Based on the personal suffering of the Latin American people from enslavement, he condemned the colonial system. He suggested condemning the colonial system in the conference's declaration. He also said: We have received telegrams informing us that the government of El Salvador, under the pretext of the convening of the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, has thrown 1,200 peace fighters in our country into prison, and in fact, they want to prevent the possible impact of this conference on people's minds in advance. This incident shows what the governments of Latin America fostered by the US State Department can do. He emphasized that the people love peace, and history will punish the criminals. Finally, on behalf of the El Salvador delegation, he requested those attending the peace conference to protest against the government of El Salvador and support the people who are suffering in the struggle for peace.

After Valdo ChÃ¡vez Velasco finished his speech, Hai, Deputy Secretary-General of the Peace Conference, stood up and presented a draft of a protest telegram to the government of El Salvador. All the representatives unanimously applauded and passed the protest telegram.

Finally, Deputy Secretary-General Hai announced that the conference had received congratulatory messages from three international trade union organizations, including the International Federation of Teachers' Unions.

The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.
