Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 17th: From the counter-offensive launched by the Korean and Chinese People's troops on October 6th until the 11th, a glorious victory of annihilating over 8,000 enemies has been achieved.

This counter-offensive, of considerable scale, was conducted in more than twenty areas on the front line, ranging from near Longtian-ri, close to the mouth of the Imjin River in the west, to Mundung-ri in the east. On the night of the 6th, our troops successively captured twenty-one enemy positions, annihilating many platoons and companies of enemies, and then controlled six important hilltop positions, preparing to inflict more casualties on the counter-attacking enemies. On the morning of the 7th, fierce battles broke out on these six hilltops. The battle for the area northwest of Cheorwon and southeast of Kimhwa was particularly fierce. A large mountain near Yaksan-dong, seven kilometers northwest of Cheorwon, has been contested repeatedly for six full days. Our soldiers, controlling the ridge, repelled countless counter-attacks by enemy companies and battalions every day. The fighting on the 11th was particularly intense. The enemy sent more than seventy aircraft, thirty-five tanks, and four hundred soldiers to seize the main peak of this mountain, launching seven successive "group charges" of densely packed troops, but all were beaten back by our troops in a state of utter rout. The abandoned enemy corpses almost covered the foothills. Later, the enemy drove two hundred more soldiers to launch two counter-attacks on the high ground west of the main peak, but they were also repelled. In the several days of fighting in the area northwest of Cheorwon, the Li Pseudo-Army’s 9th Division suffered a series of disastrous defeats and had to commit all its reserves to the battle. As a result, two regiments of the division suffered devastating blows, with more than 5,000 killed and wounded. In the battle for the areas of Mt. Kuridong-dong and Mt. Gyoyang-dong northeast of Kimhwa, our troops fought bravely and dealt heavy blows to the repeated counter-attacks of the Pseudo-Gyeonggi Division, annihilating more than 1,400 enemies in six days. In areas east of Longtian-ri, on the high ground north of Mt. Gogyangdae, northwest of Mt. Sanggasan, northwest of Byeonam-ri, and east of Amdong, our troops also annihilated more than 2,000 enemies in six days. In continuous counter-attacks, the enemy fired an average of more than 83,000 shells per day at our entire front line, with two days reaching more than 100,000 shells. An average of 594 enemy aircraft sorties assisted each day, but none of these could help their counter-attacking troops retake the hilltop positions.

While hitting back at enemy counter-attacks, our troops continued to counter-attack the enemy in other sections of the front. On the night of the 10th, our troops captured five enemy positions west of Mundung-ri, annihilating most of one defending enemy company and three platoons.

Our frontline anti-aircraft artillery units also dealt a heavy blow to the American aerial bandits in these six days, shooting down eighteen enemy planes and damaging thirty-two.

    朝中部队六天歼敌八千余名
    前线高射炮部队击落击伤敌机五十架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】朝中人民部队在十月六日开始进行的反击战，到十一日为止，已取得歼敌八千名以上的光辉胜利。
    这次规模相当巨大的反击战，是在西起临津江口附近的龙田里、东到文登里的正面战线的二十多个地区进行的。六日夜，我军先后攻占二十一处敌军阵地，歼灭了许多成连成排的敌人之后，便控制了其中的六座重要的山头阵地，准备给予前来反扑的敌人以更多的杀伤。七日早晨，就在这六个山头上爆发了激烈的争夺战。其中铁原西北和金城东南地区的争夺战尤为激烈。在铁原西北七公里的药山洞附近的一座大山，已经反复争夺了六个整天。控制着山岭的我军战士，每天都打退敌人成连成营的无数次的反扑。十一日的战斗特别激烈，敌军出动了七十多架飞机、三十五辆坦克和四百个士兵来抢夺这座大山的主峰，先后进行了七次人群密集的“集团冲锋”，但都被我军打得丢盔曳甲地溃退下去，被抛弃的敌人尸首几乎布满了山麓。后来敌人又驱使二百个士兵向主峰以西高地上进行了两次反扑，也同样被击退。在铁原西北地区的几天争夺战中，李伪军第九师连续遭到惨败，不得不将它的预备队全部投入战斗，结果该师两个团都遭到歼灭性的打击，死伤达五千多人。在金城东南栗洞东山和轿岩山东北高地的争夺战中，我军奋勇痛击伪京畿师的多次反扑，六天中已歼敌一千四百多名。在龙田里以东，高阳岱北山、上佳山西北、边岩里西北、岩洞以东等处高地上，我军在六天中也歼敌二千多名，敌人在连日反扑中，向我全线阵地平均每日发炮八万三千多发，有两天发炮竟达十万发以上；助战的敌机平均每天出动五百九十四架次之多，但是这些都不能帮助其反扑部队夺回山头阵地。
    在与打击敌人反扑同时，我军继续在战线的其他地段反击敌人。十日夜，我军在文登里以西攻取敌军阵地五处，歼灭守敌一个连和三个排的大部。
    我前线高射炮部队在这六天中也予美国空中强盗以惨重打击，击落敌机十八架，击伤敌机三十二架。
