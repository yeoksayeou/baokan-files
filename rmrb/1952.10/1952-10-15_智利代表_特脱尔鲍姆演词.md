Chilean Representative
Teitelboim's Speech

Friends from China!

We come from a distant place. We are your brothers on the other side of the Pacific, and we represent the love of peace of the people of Latin America. In Beijing, we Asians, within ten days, freely and democratically discussed the basic task of our era: namely, the concrete protection of peaceful coexistence. We know that peace is not only the symbol of the dove flying in the sky, but is composed of the flesh and blood of the struggle for national liberation. With peace, all good people will have bread and progress. As representatives of sixteen hundred million people, we see here that under the wings of the dove of peace, all thoughts and beliefs, all peoples and all races can coexist.

This conference enriched our movement because it gave us many new and valuable experiences and practical solutions. In this place we see more clearly how quickly the peace camp is expanding, much larger than the forces on the side of the warmongers. Through personal observation, we know that no force in the world can destroy the brotherly and intimate friendship between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the new democratic countries, and the people of all countries.

Now, as the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is about to end, we would like to say to all our friends, to the Chinese government and the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace: "In the name of our peoples, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you."

We do not want to say goodbye. We would like to say this: "We feel that the Pacific is beginning to become a bridge of unity for the people of the countries on both sides of it, and no longer the high wall of division that war and colonialism have erected for us—the enemy of peace, the oppressor of the past and present makes us have to complete the task."

Moreover, this ocean will be more peaceful and glorious when the resolutions of our conference are realized through the organization and hard work of the people of all countries, that is, when peace, which is cherished and conducive to construction—the atmosphere absolutely necessary for human happiness, freedom, culture and the development of various arts—is re-established in Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Malaya. By then, mothers will think of the use of bacteriological weapons only as a terrible nightmare, and by then, American aggressors will no longer bomb the borders and inviolable fields of Northeast China. By then, all peoples will have won their independence. By then, Japan will be a free and democratic country, and no longer a cannon in the hands of imperialism aiming at the noble heart of China.

When we see countless ships carrying wheat, machines, copper, nitrate, oil, tin, tea, rice and wisdom sailing in all directions on our common ocean, this ocean will appear more peaceful. By then, these ships will carry tens of thousands of passengers, including workers, artists, engineers, industrialists and farmers; as well as those young men and women who ensure free economic and cultural exchange.

Dear friends: We will soon return home. We are very sad that we have just met the heroic Chinese people and now we have to leave them. But at the same time, we will be very happy to return, because we have seen their new life, and also because we are now returning to our respective fighting posts to complete a noble task: namely, to carry out the struggle for peace in the countries of the Americas. We plan to tell the people of each of our countries faithfully everything we have seen and everything we have experienced after we return. We only need to tell them the truth, and this truth is as great as the land of China and the hearts of the Chinese people, it is a message of extreme importance, and we have the obligation to turn it into the thoughts and actions of the masses.

After we return, we must tell the ordinary people of the American continent: "Listen! Men and women who suffer from hunger and injustice, who dream of a good life! We have seen that kind of life: we have seen the largest nation that has been oppressed for thousands of years, today living a free and independent life, which they have achieved through their own struggle." In China, a great new dawn has appeared. We have seen this great construction carried out in a peaceful environment with our own eyes. Almost ten days ago, we saw the great surging peace power they showed in front of Tiananmen. We have personally confirmed this indestructible moral and political unity that exists between the people and the government. We deeply admire their mature awareness and their high degree of organization, both domestically and internationally. We are moved by the care given to men, women and children.

We want to tell our people that on a very important day in 1949, Chairman Mao said: "Our nation will never again be a nation that is insulted, we have stood up." We will strive to explain to them how this sentence has become a reality.

Yes, no matter where we go, we see that China has stood up and China is moving forward. Today, it is a nation loved and respected by the people of the world, a country with hundreds of millions of friends all over the world, this country is an example and a beacon for us South Americans. We want to tell our friends on the other side of the ocean: The Chinese people are not just an extremely humble, polite, and hospitable nation, a nation with unlimited value, a strong labor force, and full of ancient wisdom; but for us, most importantly, it is a nation that shows the way to freedom to all colonies and vassal states. For us, what we must thoroughly study is its land reform. We came here to enter a great and glorious school to learn.

We will return to our old world—to a world corrupted by imperialism and feudal forces—we will remember this new world in our hearts. We will not hide this beautiful scene in our hearts; we will tell all our people that they are suffering the unfortunate consequences of the war policy. Latin America is not a docile slave of foreign tycoons. Day after day, it continues to struggle for peace, national liberation and human happiness. It is also fighting against military conventions, for the recovery of raw material resources and for the maintenance of its national culture. In this great movement, China is a great source of inspiration. Here, the horn of the peace fighter is loud and powerful. We only have one thing to say: The echo of the conference of the people of Asian and Pacific countries will cross the ocean, and cities and villages in the Americas will hear it.

We solemnly guarantee to bring this flag back to our people. We are confident that they will do their part to fight to make the friendship between our countries and all countries in the world last forever.

### 智利代表  特脱尔鲍姆演词

    智利代表
    特脱尔鲍姆演词中国的朋友们！
    我们来自很远的地方。我们是太平洋那一岸你们的弟兄，我们代表着拉丁美洲人民对和平的热爱。　在北京，我们和亚洲人在十天以内共同自由地、民主地讨论了我们这个时代基本的任务：那就是具体地保卫和平共处这个问题。我们知道和平不仅是那飞翔在天地之间的鸽子的象征，而是由争取民族解放斗争的血肉所组成的。有了和平，一切善良的人，就有面包和进步。作为十六亿人类的代表，我们在这里看到了在和平鸽的翅膀之下，一切思想和信仰，所有的人民和所有的种族都是可以共处的。
    这次会议丰富了我们的运动，因为它给了我们许多新的、宝贵的经验和实际的解决办法。在这个地方我们更明白地看到了和平阵营是以何等的速度在扩大，比战争贩子那一边的力量大得多。我们通过亲身的观察知道世界上没有力量能够破坏苏联、中华人民共和国、新民主主义国家以及所有各国的人民之间的兄弟般的亲密友谊。
    现在，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议就要结束，我们愿意向我们所有的朋友，向中国政府和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会说：“以我们各国人民的名义，从我们心的深处向你们道谢。”
    我们不愿说再见。我们想这样说：“我们觉得现在太平洋以正在开始成为它的两岸各国人民的一座团结的桥梁了，而不再是战争和殖民主义给我们树立的那座使我们分裂的高墙了——这是和平的敌人，过去与现在的压迫者使我们不能不完成的任务。”
    而且，这个海洋还要更加和平和光荣的，那就是当我们会议的决议由于各国人民组织起来，努力工作而得到实现的时候，那就是当被人珍贵着的和平，很有利于建设的和平——人类幸福、自由、文化和各种艺术发达所绝对需要的气氛——重又在朝鲜、越南、寮国、高棉和马来亚实现的时候。到那时，母亲们回想到细菌武器的使用，只当它是一个可怕的梦魔，到那时，美国侵略者不再轰炸中国东北的边境和不可侵犯的田野了。到那时，所有各国人民都已经赢得他们的独立了。到那时，日本已是一个自由民主的国家，而不再是帝国主义手中的一尊向中国高贵心脏瞄准着的大炮了。
    当我们看到载着麦子、机器、铜、硝酸盐、油、锡、茶、米和智慧的无数条船在我们这个共同的海洋上向着各方面行驶的时候，这个海洋将会显得更加平静的。到那时，这些船只将载着成千上万的旅客，有工人、艺术家、工程师、工业家和农民；还有那些年轻的男人和女人，他们使得自由的经济与文化交流有了保证。
    亲爱的朋友们：不久我们就要回国了。我们很难过，我们刚刚认识了英勇的中国人民，现在就要离开他们了。但同时我们也将很高兴地回去，因为我们看到了他们的新的生活，同时也因为我们现在是要回到我们各自的战斗岗位上去完成一个崇高的任务：那就是在美洲各国进行争取和平的斗争。我们打算在回去以后把我们所看到的一切以及所经过的
    一切忠实地告诉我们每一个国家的人民。我们只要告诉他们真实的情况就行了，这个真实的情况是像中国的土地和中国人的心胸一样伟大，它是一个意义极端重大的消息，我们有义务把它变成群众的思想和行动。
    我们回去以后，我们一定告诉美洲大陆的普通人民：“听着！遭受饥饿和不公正的待遇、梦想过好生活的男女们！我们已经看到了那种生活：我们已经看到了几千年来遭受压迫的世界上最大的民族，今天过着自由和独立自主的生活，这是靠他们自己的斗争得来的。”在中国，出现了伟大的新的黎明。我们亲眼看到了这种在和平环境中进行的伟大建设。差不多在十天以前，我们看到了他们在天安门前表现的那种奔腾澎湃的伟大的和平力量。我们已经亲眼证实了这种在人民和政府间存在的不可摧毁的道德与政治上的团结。我们深深敬佩他们在国内和国际上表现出来的成熟的觉悟和他们高度的组织性。我们为男人、妇女和儿童所得到的关照而感动。
    我们要告诉我们的人民，在一九四九年，一个极重要的日子里，毛主席曾说：“我们的民族将再也不是一个被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站起来了。”我们将努力向他们说明这句话是怎样地变成了事实。
    是的，不论在什么地方，我们都看到中国已经站起来了，中国在前进。今天，它已是一个被世界人民所爱戴所尊敬的民族，一个在世界各地有着几万万朋友的国家，这个国家，是我们南美洲人的榜样和灯塔。我们要告诉我们的远在海洋的那一岸的朋友们说：中国人民还不止是一个极端谦和、多礼、好客的民族，一个有无限价值，有强大的劳动力并充满着古老的智慧的民族；而对我们说来，最重要的，它乃是一个向一切殖民地和附庸国家指示走向自由之路的民族。对于我们，我们所必须彻底研究的乃是它的土地改革。我们来到这里正是走进一个伟大辉煌的学校学习来了。
    我们将回到我们的旧世界去——回到帝国主义和封建势力所腐蚀的世界去——在我们心里将记住这个新的世界。我们不会把这个美好的光景藏在心里；我们要告诉所有我们的人民，他们正在遭受着战争政策的不幸后果。拉丁美洲不是外国大亨的驯服奴隶。一天接一天，它为了和平、民族解放和人类幸福不断地进行斗争。它也为了反对军事公约，为了收回原料的资源和维护它的民族文化而斗争。在这个伟大的运动里面，中国是一个伟大的鼓舞力量。在这里，和平战士的号角是响亮而有力量的。我们只有一件事还要说一说：亚洲及太平洋各国人民的会议的回声将要越过海洋，美洲的城市和乡村中都会听到它。
    我们庄严地保证把这面旗帜带回给我们的人民看。我们确信他们会尽他们的一份力量来斗争，使我们各国间，全世界各国间的友谊永远存在下去。
