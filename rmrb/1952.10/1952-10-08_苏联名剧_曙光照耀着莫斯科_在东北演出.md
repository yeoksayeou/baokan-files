    Soviet Famous Play "Dawn Over Moscow" Performed in Northeast China
    Xue Yuan
    The Northeast People's Art Theatre performed the famous Soviet drama "Dawn Over Moscow" in Shenyang and Dalian, receiving warm welcome and praise from the broad masses of the audience. It provided a profound communist education to the audience and played a certain role in promoting the improvement of the current industrial construction in Northeast China. The "Northeast Daily" specially organized extensive discussions for the performance of this drama, and "Northeast Literature and Art" also published a review article.

    "Dawn Over Moscow" expresses the active enthusiasm, full of confidence, and constantly inventing and creating people who build a better life in the Soviet state, on the road to communism, carrying out a firm struggle against conservatives and new-style bureaucrats who lack a sense of novelty. It illustrates that only by constantly engaging in irreconcilable struggle against the erroneous ideas that hinder the cause of building communism can the cause of communism be advanced. "Dawn Over Moscow" means that the brilliant dawn of communism has illuminated the Soviet land, "tomorrow has already arrived," and the new communist era requires all the people of the Soviet Union to "transform the world according to the laws of beauty" and create a poetic and beautiful life for mankind.

    "Dawn Over Moscow" depicts the conflict between two types of people and two types of thinking that occurred in a textile factory. Factory Director Kapitolina has strong conservative ideas; she "only looks at life from the window of her office." She cannot see the improvement of the cultural level and material life of the Soviet people today, nor can she realize the reality of the imminent arrival of communism. Therefore, she leads production only by blindly pursuing quantity and ignoring the improvement of quality. Although she loves the factory and works selflessly all day long, the calico produced by their factory is rough in material and ugly in color, unable to meet the needs of the people. This backward conservative thinking was severely criticized by Party Secretary Kurepin. Kurepin is an excellent cadre of the Party. Although he is new to the factory, he is good at learning, able to rely on the masses, discover the main problems in the work, and adhere to principles and fight against incorrect ideas. Kapitolina's daughter, Sanya, is a vibrant young woman who loves her work. Dissatisfied with her mother's conservative views, she, with the encouragement and support of Kurepin, experiments with making a brightly colored and beautifully patterned material to replace the poor-quality products. Sanya's experiment finally succeeded, producing a calico as beautiful as the dawn and clouds.

    The full and vivid character images in this drama gave the audience a deep impression. The positive characters in the play all possess the beautiful communist thoughts and moral qualities; they are full of passionate love for the motherland, the people, the work, and the labor, and full of creative enthusiasm for a better life. Even Kapitolina, who made mistakes but resolutely repented once she realized them, is also endearing. From this play, people see the real scene of socialist society, and how the people of the Soviet state are carrying out fierce struggles with all outdated things and concepts in order to create a better future.

    The play has been performed 136 times in Northeast China up to September 24, with an audience of more than 156,000 people. The reason why it can receive such a warm welcome and give the audience such a profound education is because what it describes and criticizes exactly matches some of the situations in our work, and it hits the weaknesses in the thinking of some of our cadres. In our factories and enterprises, are there not also such "new-style bureaucrats"? They do not trust the masses, and they adopt a negative attitude towards the promotion of advanced experience. In order to avoid being criticized as "backward," they also shout about promoting advanced experience, but they do not solve the actual difficulties of the workers, do not improve labor organization, and always emphasize objective difficulties everywhere, thinking that "there is no way at all," saying "the old habits of the workers cannot be changed!" Or "the conditions are different, let's just do it the old way!" Are there not comrades who do not value the preferences of the vast consumers, do not mobilize all employees to improve their work, and whose production and supply lack foresight and are divorced from the needs of the market? Are there not cadres who lack the spirit of care and encouragement like Kurepin's for Sanya towards the newborn things, towards the workers and masses who are dissatisfied with the status quo, have beautiful ideals, and are enthusiastic about reforming their work? Are there not cadres who only see the part and not the whole, and do not know that the production or marketing of a unit is closely related to all aspects of society, but only use a narrow and one-sided view like Kapitolina's to "complete the task"? Are there not some comrades who are responsible for the Party's leadership work who lack principles, accommodate each other among comrades, "are afraid of hurting feelings," and take a liberal attitude towards bad phenomena, without criticism or struggle, and thus lose the Party's leading role? ... "Dawn Over Moscow" just gave a painful and powerful criticism to all these erroneous ideas.

    In the many comrades' reflections published in the "Northeast Daily," it is very clear that this drama has a wide and profound educational significance for us. Li Zhengguang, Deputy Director of the Textile Administration Bureau of the Northeast Industrial Department, said: "The needs of the people of the new China are constantly increasing with the rapid development of the country's economic construction. We lead the textile industry, which is closely related to the people's lives. Although we also pay attention to the quality requirements of the products, we always have to wait for the market sales situation to reflect that the people no longer welcome our products before we passively improve the quality standards. We cannot grasp the law of the improvement of people's lives, and constantly improve the quality in a planned way to meet the needs of the people." Guo Changfu, Chairman of the Northeast District Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union, said: "In our textile system, all levels of working cadres also have varying degrees of conservative thinking. When discussing production plans, they feel that the plans are set too high and are afraid of not being able to complete the tasks; when discussing quality, they feel that it is much stronger than in the past, and it improves year by year. How can it be improved now? These comrades cannot boldly look forward, cannot see the demands of the people, nor can they see the potential in industrial production, and cannot see the possibility of improving quality." Hu Xulun, Manager of the Northeast District Company of the China Department Store Corporation, said: "We often have a situation where the supply lags far behind the needs of the masses. Some of our stores have been called 'Black and White (Cloth) Companies' by the people. Because what the people need now is beautiful calico, colored cloth and sturdy twill." Cai Yeqiao, Deputy Director of the Shenyang Woolen Mill, said: "To a certain extent, we also only pursue quantity. Although we have reached the specifications, the people do not like our products, and they are piled up in the trade department. Our factory has completed the task of increasing production and practicing economy, but the goods are pressed in the trade department, which causes losses to the country." Wang Bangping, Director of the Storage and Transportation Bureau of the Northeast People's Government Trade Department, said: "The circulation process of commodities of a socialist nature is a whole, but in the past we had a strong small producer's way of thinking, 'I do mine, you do yours,' which is a separatist approach." Wei Wenfeng, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Shenyang Smelter, said: "'Dawn Over Moscow' has been of great help to our leading ideology and quality make-up work. In particular, the character of Kurepin has been very enlightening to me personally. From him, we see how to 'turn the future into reality, and turn tomorrow into today', thus enhancing the confidence in work and victory." Many comrades examined their work and conducted ideological self-criticism. "Dawn Over Moscow" thus enlightened us in many ways with its high degree of ideological and artistic quality.

    The playwright Anatoly Surov drew the theme of his work from a rich realistic life, and created fleshy and vivid character images. The author's political ideas are truly reflected through a high degree of artistic expression, through the typical character of the characters; it is not an abstract lecture on political principles, but a deep excavation of real life, reflecting the essential contradictions of things and the movement and resolution of these contradictions. Therefore, it can deeply move people and have a huge educational effect on the audience.

    The performance of this play by the Northeast People's Art Theatre is a very meaningful work. It has played a direct educational role for the broad masses of the audience, especially the working cadres of factories and enterprises, and it is also a good learning experience for literary and art workers.

    苏联名剧“曙光照耀着莫斯科”在东北演出
    雪原
    东北人民艺术剧院在沈阳和大连演出了苏联著名话剧“曙光照耀着莫斯科”，受到广大观众的热烈欢迎和称赞。它对广大观众进行了深刻的共产主义教育，并对当前东北工业建设的改进，起了一定的推动作用。“东北日报”特为这个剧的演出组织了广泛的讨论，“东北文艺”也发表了评论文章。
    “曙光照耀着莫斯科”是表现苏维埃国家里的积极热情，满怀信心，以不断的发明和创造，建设美好的生活的人们，在向共产主义前进的道路上，对于缺乏新鲜事物的感觉的保守主义者、新型官僚主义者，所进行的坚决的斗争。它说明了：只有不断地向阻碍建设共产主义事业的错误思想作不调和的斗争，才能把共产主义事业推向前进。“曙光照耀着莫斯科”就是意味着共产主义灿烂的曙光，已经照临在苏联大地上，“明天已经到来”，新的共产主义时代，要求苏联全体人民“按照美的法则来改造世界”，创造人类诗一般的美好生活。
    “曙光照耀着莫斯科”是描写一个纺织工厂内所发生的两种人物、两种思想的冲突。厂长卡碧特丽娜有浓厚的保守思想，她“只是从办公室的窗子里看人生”。她看不到苏联今天人民文化水平和物质生活的提高，也意识不到共产主义即将到来的现实。所以她领导生产只是盲目地追求数量，忽视质量的提高。虽然她热爱工厂，终日忘我地工作，可是她们的工厂所出产的花布却质料粗糙，花色难看，不能满足人民的要求。这种落后保守思想遭到了党委书记库列平严厉的批评。库列平是党的优秀的干部，虽然初到工厂，但是他善于学习，能够依靠群众，发现工作中的主要问题，并且坚持原则和不正确的思想进行斗争。卡碧特丽娜的女儿桑妮亚，是一个充满朝气的热爱工作的青年，她不满她母亲的保守观点，在库列平的鼓励和支持下，她试验制造一种颜色鲜艳，花样美丽的料子，来代替质量粗劣的产品。桑妮亚的试验终于成功，制出了像曙光、像云彩一样美丽的花布。
    这个剧中的丰满的鲜明的人物形象，给了观众以深刻的印象。剧中正面人物都具备着优美的共产主义的思想与道德品质，他们对祖国、对人民、对工作、对劳动充满了热烈的爱，对美好生活充满了创造的热情。就是那个犯了错误而一经认识就决然悔改的卡碧特丽娜也是使人感到可亲可爱的。从这个剧里，人们看到了社会主义社会的实景，看到了苏维埃国家的人们在怎样地为创造美好的未来而和一切陈旧的事物和观念进行着剧烈的斗争。
    这个剧在东北上演，到九月二十四日止已演出了一百三十六场，观众达十五万六千余人。它所以能够受到这么热烈的欢迎，给予观众以这样深刻的教育，是因为它所描写和批评的也正好符合我们工作上的一些情况，正好击中了我们有些干部的思想上的弱点。在我们的工厂企业部门中，不是也有这样的“新型官僚主义者”吗？他们不相信群众，对先进经验的推广采取消极态度，他们为了怕被人批评为“落后”，也喊叫推广先进经验，但不去解决工人的实际困难，不去改善劳动组织，总是处处强调客观困难，认为“一点办法也没有”，说什么“工友的老习惯，改不过来！”或是“条件不同，还是照老样做下去吧！”不是有的同志不重视广大消费者的喜爱，不去发动全体职工改进工作，生产供应缺乏预见性，脱离市场的需要吗？不是有的干部对于新生的萌芽的东西，对于不满于现状，怀着美好的理想，热心于改革工作的职工群众，缺乏像剧中库列平对桑妮亚那样关心和鼓励的精神吗？不是有的干部只看局部，看不见整体，不晓得一个单位的生产或供销，是与社会各方面发生着密切的联系，而只是像卡碧特丽娜那样的用狭隘的片面的观点去
    “完成任务”吗？不是有些担负党的领导工作的同志缺乏原则性，在同志间互相迁就，“怕伤感情”，对待不良现象采取自由主义的态度，不批评，不斗争，因而丧失了党的领导作用吗？……“曙光照耀着莫斯科”正好给了这一切错误思想以痛切的有力的批评。
    在“东北日报”发表的许多同志的感想文字中，十分清楚地表明了这个剧对于我们有多么广泛而深刻的教育意义。东北工业部纺织管理局副局长李正光说：“新中国的人民的需要是随着国家经济建设的迅速发展不断地提高的，我们领导着与人民生活密切相关的纺织工业，虽然也注意了产品的质量要求，但总是要等市场的推销情况反映人民已经不欢迎我们的产品的时候，我们才被动地提高质量标准。我们不能掌握人民生活提高的规律，有预见性地、有计划地不断提高质量来满足人民的需要。”中国纺织工会东北区委员会主席郭常夫说：“在我们纺织系统，各级工作干部中也都存在着程度不同的保守思想。一讨论到生产计划，就觉得计划订的高了，怕任务完不成；一讨论到质量就觉得比过去强多了，一年比一年提高，现在还怎么提高呢？这些同志不能大胆地向前看，看不到人民的要求，也没有看到工业生产中的潜在力，看不到质量提高的可能。”中国百货公司东北区公司经理胡叙伦说：“我们常常出现一种状况，供应远远落后于群众的需要。我们的某些商店曾被人民群众称为：‘黑白（布）公司’。因为，人民现在需要的已经是漂亮的花布、色布和坚实的斜纹布了。”沈阳毛织厂副厂长蔡野樵说：“在一定程度上，我们也是只追求数量，虽然达到了规格，但人民不喜欢我们的产品，堆在贸易部里。我们厂是完成了增产节约任务，但货物压在贸易部里却又给国家造成损失。”东北人民政府贸易部储运局局长王邦平说：“社会主义性质的商品流转过程是一个整体，而我们过去却存在着浓厚的小生产者的思想方法，‘我做我的，你做你的’，这是一种割裂的作法。”沈阳冶炼厂党委书记魏文风说：“‘曙光照耀着莫斯科’对我们领导思想，质量补课工作都有很大的帮助。特别是库列平这个人物对我个人的启发教育很大，从他身上我们看到如何‘使未来变为现实，使明天变为今天’，因而增强了工作和胜利的信心。”许多同志检查了工作，进行了思想检讨。“曙光照耀着莫斯科”就是这样以其高度的思想性和艺术性，多方面地启发着我们。
    剧作者安纳托利·苏洛夫从丰富的现实生活中吸取了作品的主题，创造了血肉丰满的人物形象。作者的政治思想是通过高度的艺术表现，通过典型的人物性格真实地体现出来的；它不是抽象的政治原则的讲说，而是深刻地挖掘了现实生活，反映了事物的本质的矛盾和这个矛盾的运动与解决。因此，它就能够深刻地感动人，对观众产生巨大的教育作用。
    东北人民艺术剧院演出这个剧本，是一件很有意义的工作。它对广大观众特别是工厂企业工作干部起了直接的教育作用，对文艺工作者也是一种很好的学习。
