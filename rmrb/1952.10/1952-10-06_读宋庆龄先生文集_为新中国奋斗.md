Reading "Struggle for New China," a Collection of Essays by Soong Ching Ling
Wang Ruoshui

"Struggle for New China" is a magnificent and brilliant work advocating for the victory of the Chinese revolution and the defense of world peace. In this book, the author, Madam Soong Ching Ling, has collected her important speeches, articles, and statements published since 1927. This collection not only allows people to see a revolutionary personality standing firm in the face of violent storms but also reflects, in some important aspects, the history of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle during that era.

The author is one of the outstanding political activists of modern China: she was a staunch supporter of Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies of alliance with Russia, cooperation with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, and a close friend of the Chinese working class and the Chinese Communist Party. Her noble character, her consistent loyalty to the cause of the people's revolution and world peace, her clear and firm political views, and her courageous and fearless fighting spirit are all reasons for the Chinese people to feel honored and proud of her.

The first article in the book, "Statement of Protest Against the Violation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Revolutionary Principles and Policies," is a famous document opposing counter-revolution. This document was published on July 14, 1927, on the eve of the Kuomintang's open betrayal in Wuhan. The author severely denounced this shameless betrayal and announced her split with the traitors. She believed that only by relying on the working class and the peasantry could there be a victory for the Chinese revolution. In this militant document, she pointed out the important position of the working class and peasantry in the revolution, saying:

	"These two classes (referring to workers and peasants – author's note) are the foundation of our strength in our struggle to overthrow imperialism, abolish the unequal treaties that enslave us, and effectively unify the country. They are the new pillars for building a free New China. Without their support, as a revolutionary party, the Kuomintang's social program would be weak, chaotic, and illogical; without their support, political issues would be unclear. If we adopt any policies that weaken this support, we are shaking the foundations of the Party, betraying the masses, and not truly loyal to Sun Yat-sen."

She rebuked those traitors who violated Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary principles and policies, saying:

	"Sun Yat-sen's policies are clear. If the leaders of the Party cannot implement his policies, they are no longer true believers of Sun Yat-sen; the Party is no longer a revolutionary party, but merely a tool of this or that warlord. The Party will not become a vibrant force striving for the future happiness of the Chinese people, but will become a machine, an instrument of oppression of the people, a parasite that uses the current system of slavery to enrich itself."

Here, she declared her "temporary withdrawal" from the Kuomintang and stated that she "will no longer participate" in the implementation of the Kuomintang's new policies.

A month after publishing this statement, the author published "Statement Before Going to Moscow," announcing her visit to the Soviet Union. In this statement, she affirmed that "the Chinese Communist Party is undoubtedly the greatest driving force among the internal revolutionary forces in China," that "the Soviet Union has not imposed unequal treaties on China," and that "the Soviet Union is the strongest among all revolutionary forces in the world," reiterating her position of adhering to Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies.

After the "September 18th" Incident in 1931, she published an essay entitled "The Kuomintang is No Longer a Political Force." This essay began with a categorical declaration: "As a political force, the Kuomintang has ceased to exist."

She believed that "Is it any wonder that the Kuomintang is now disgraced and despised and hated by the whole country? Sun Yat-sen's will has never been truly implemented for a single day." She pointed out the essence of Chiang Kai-shek's rule, saying: "It can be clearly seen that the new unified government is composed of agents of imperialism, such as Japan, France, Britain, and the United States, serving these conflicting masters, and it will continue to accept the orders of the imperialists and suppress any form of mass movement of the Chinese nation seeking liberation."

Finally, she wrote: "I cannot bear to see Sun Yat-sen's forty years of work destroyed by a small group of selfish and self-serving Kuomintang warlords and politicians. I cannot bear to see China, with its 475 million people, perish at the hands of imperialism because the Kuomintang has abandoned its own principles."

	"Therefore, I have no choice but to frankly declare that since the purpose of organizing the Kuomintang was to make it a revolutionary machine, and since it has failed to fulfill the task for which it was created, we need not regret its demise."

She continued to write with unparalleled confidence in the people's revolutionary cause:

	"I firmly believe that only a revolution based on the masses and serving the masses can smash the power of warlords and politicians, can break free from the shackles of imperialism, and can truly implement socialism. I am convinced that although the reactionary forces in power today are carrying out acts of terror, millions of true revolutionaries in China will not abandon their responsibilities; on the contrary, due to the urgency of the current situation in the country, they will intensify their work and advance victoriously toward the goals set by the revolution."

History is a powerful testament to the outstanding insights and firm confidence of this brave warrior. Eighteen years after she published this essay, millions of true revolutionaries in China and all the people who longed to break free from the shackles of imperialism finally won a glorious victory in the revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong.

The article "The Kuomintang is No Longer a Political Force" clearly marked the end of the author's period of identifying herself as a Kuomintang leftist. She began to independently engage in various practical activities that were broadly linked to the people's revolutionary struggle and the world peace movement. In order to resist the terror rule of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, in 1932, she and Lu Xun, Yang Quan, and others initiated the organization of the "China League for Civil Rights." In the article "The Tasks of the China League for Civil Rights," she loudly appealed:

	"We demand the release of all political prisoners. They are not criminals, they are pioneers in the struggle for human liberation. ... The essence of the Chinese people is being destroyed in prisons; while hooligans, warlords, professional politicians, capitalists, and feudal landlords hold important positions in the government, offering our country to imperialism. This is truly an unparalleled scandal. If China is not to become an enslaved country, our demand for the release of all political prisoners is a revolutionary necessity."

The author enthusiastically praised the true democratic system of the Soviet Union and criticized the so-called democracy of capitalist countries, believing that this democracy "is merely a system that strictly protects the power of a small group of exploiters." And the Kuomintang's so-called laws are even more a tool that "openly and shamelessly serves the interests of a very small number of feudal landlords, capitalists, and imperialists."

The people's democratic rights are inviolable. She issued a warning to the Kuomintang reactionaries:

	"Those who think they can indefinitely extend their bloody rule over the people are greatly mistaken. The masses of the people must fight for their basic rights. This struggle will strengthen, will sweep the country, and will make China strong and unified. ..."

Since Japan's occupation of Northeast China in 1931, the national crisis has become increasingly serious. During this period, Madam Soong Ching Ling waged a tremendous struggle to respond to the Chinese Communist Party's call to stop the civil war and unite to resist Japan and to strive for its realization.

In the article "Chinese Workers, Unite!", the author pointed out that it is impossible to rely on the Chiang Kai-shek government to wage the war of resistance against Japan. She wrote:

	"The Chiang Kai-shek government cannot unify China, cannot lead the armed people to carry out the national revolutionary war against Japanese imperialism, and cannot give land to the peasants. Why can't it? Because it always wants to compromise with imperialism. Because it fears the armed people more than the imperialist aggressors, because it is the representative of the landlord and bourgeois cliques that oppress the masses, harm the country, and bring disaster to the people."

She believed that only the broad masses of peasants under the leadership of the working class were an irresistible force to defeat Japanese imperialism. She firmly opposed the anti-communist war of the Chiang Kai-shek government and called on the people of the whole country to rise up to stop the Kuomintang reactionaries' attack on the Chinese red area centered on Jiangxi. In her speech "China's Freedom and the Anti-War Struggle" delivered at the Shanghai Anti-War Conference in 1933, she pointed out: "The vast Soviet area has existed in China for many years, and this fact is the hope, promise, and guarantee that the vast Chinese people will follow the same path." At this secret anti-war conference held in disregard of the White Terror in the Kuomintang area, she repeatedly stated the necessity of revolutionary classes and oppressed people to carry out armed struggle to resist oppression and strive for national liberation, "because the reactionary forces will never automatically give up their power." Finally, she appealed to the people of the whole country:

	"Let us unite and fight against those who betray the country and sell our territory to the imperialists province by province! Let us unite and use our greatest strength to defend the Chinese workers and peasants who have already been liberated from the bonds of imperialist rule and feudal exploitation, and who are now suffering the fifth and largest-scale attack by the Kuomintang army. This attack is directly aided by $16 million of the $50 million lent by the United States to the Chiang Kai-shek government, aided by American planes, bombs, and flight instructors, and aided by the full support of the navies of Japan, Britain, the United States, and France to the Kuomintang (such as the recent Fujian Incident), and aided by all kinds of material and spiritual assistance from the imperialists."

At the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in 1937, she sternly rebuked those anti-communist elements, saying: "How absurd it is that we can still hear the old tune of 'Suppressing the Communists first before resisting Japan' today! Are we going to break an arm before resisting Japan?" ("Implementing Sun Yat-sen's Will")

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the author was an active supporter and propagandist of the Chinese Communist Party's united front policy and the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. The "Statement on Kuomintang-Communist Cooperation" shows her active support for the anti-Japanese national united front. She opposed the Kuomintang's conspiracies to undermine unity and undermine the war of resistance. In the article "China Needs More Democracy," she pointed out that "The anti-Japanese national united front does not mean that the parties belonging to it cannot have their own views and goals. It does not mean the dictatorship of any one party or faction." "Lack of democracy allows compromisers and appeasers to operate in secret, preparing to surrender; many of them are not only colluding with the enemy, but also have links with the entire conspiracy of the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis against human progress." In the "Open Letter to Chinese Friends Overseas," she stated that the China Defense League she led must focus its relief efforts on the liberated areas created by the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. She said:

	"The reason why we focus on the guerrilla areas is because, although they have tied down and are still tying down almost half of Japan's forces in China, they have not received any weapons or financial assistance for three years, as well as medical assistance that is particularly relevant to our work. When Spain was armed and resisting fascism alone in Europe, the unfortunate 'non-interference' policy prevented it from obtaining weapons. And today, the army that is most heavily attacking the Japanese fascist positions in China is encountering a more severe and cruel 'non-interference' policy. The domestic political blockade deprives them of doctors, surgical instruments, and medicines; they cannot even get them from foreign friends. We do not ask for preferential treatment for them, but for equal treatment, for the lifting of the blockade, and we appeal to everyone not to acquiesce to the blockade."

After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the author was an opponent of the United States' conspiracy to aid Chiang Kai-shek in launching a civil war. In the "Statement on Promoting the Organization of a Coalition Government and Calling on the American People to Stop Their Government's Military Assistance to the Kuomintang," the author wrote:

	"The American people are the allies and old friends of the Chinese people, and we must clearly tell them that this is a disastrous path. We must tell them that the reactionaries in the United States are colluding with the reactionaries in China, acting as accomplices. We must tell them that the American troops currently in China are not strengthening the peace of the Chinese people. We must advise them that all loans can only be lent to a government that is truly representative of the people and recognized by the people. We must tell them that if the United States can clearly state that it will no longer supply arms and military assistance, then the Chinese civil war will never expand."

After the national liberation in 1949, the author published many powerful works with ardent feelings for the revolutionary people, praising New China and striving for world peace. These works are magnificent poems recited by a wide range of readers. It is no longer necessary to introduce these recent works in detail in this short article.

"Struggle for New China" is a militant and enthusiastic book. The publication of this book is a welcome event. We firmly believe that the Chinese and world people will be inspired by this book and gain the power to create a peaceful and happy life.

    读宋庆龄先生文集“为新中国奋斗”
    王若水
    “为新中国奋斗”是一部争取中国革命胜利和保卫世界和平的辉煌的巨著。在这本书里面，作者宋庆龄先生收集了她在一九二七年以来所发表的重要的演讲、文章和声明。这本集子不仅使人们看到屹立在疾风暴雨中坚贞不屈的一个革命的人格，而且从一些重要的方面反映了这一时代的中国人民的革命斗争的历史。
    作者是近代中国的卓越的政治活动家之一：她是孙中山联俄、联共和扶助农工三大政策的坚决的拥护者，中国工人阶级和中国共产党的亲密的友人。她的高尚的品质，她的对于人民革命和世界和平事业的一贯的忠诚，她的鲜明而坚定的政治见解，她的勇敢无畏的斗争精神，都足以使中国人民为她感到光荣和骄傲。
    本书的第一篇文章“为抗议违反孙中山的革命原则和政策的声明”就是一个反对反革命的著名的文件。这个文件发表于一九二七年七月十四日，正是武汉国民党公开叛变的前夕。作者严厉地指斥了这个无耻的叛变，并且宣布与叛徒们分裂。她认为只有依靠工人阶级和农民阶级，才可能有中国革命的胜利。在这个战斗的文件中，她指出工农阶级在革命中的重要地位说：
    “这两个阶级（按指工农——作者）在我们打倒帝国主义、废除奴役我们的不平等条约和有效地统一全国的斗争中，都是我们力量的基础。他们是建设自由新中国的新柱石。如果没有他们的支持，作为一个革命的政党，国民党的社会纲领便会软弱无力、混乱而不合逻辑；如果没有他们的支持，政治问题就模糊不清。如果我们采取了削弱这种支持的任何政策，我们便动摇了党的基础，出卖了群众，而且不是真正忠于孙中山。”
    她斥责那些违反孙中山的革命原则和政策的叛徒们说：
    “孙中山的政策是明明白白的。如果党内领袖不能贯彻他的政策，他们便不再是孙中山的真实信徒；党也就不再是革命的党，而不过是这个或那个军阀的工具而已。党就不成为一种为中国人民谋未来幸福的生气勃勃的力量，而会变为一部机器、一种压迫人民的工具、一条利用现在的奴隶制度以自肥的寄生虫。”
    在这里她声明从国民党“暂时引退”，对于国民党新政策的执行，“将不再参加”。
    在发表这个声明一个月以后，作者发表“赴莫斯科前的声明”，宣布她将访问苏联。在这个声明中，她认定“中国共产党无疑地是中国内部革命力量中最大的动力”，“苏联没有以不平等条约加之于中国”，“苏联在世界上所有革命力量中最为壮大”，再一次申述了她的坚持孙中山三大政策的立场。
    一九三一年“九一八”事变以后，她发表了一篇题为“国民党已不再是一个政治力量”的论文。这篇论文一开头就斩钉截铁地宣布说：　“当作一个政治力量来说，国民党已经不复存在了。”
    她认为“国民党今天已名誉扫地，受到全国的厌弃和痛恨，还有什么可奇怪的呢？孙中山的遗嘱连一天也没有真正实行过。”她指出蒋介石统治的本质说：“可以明白地看出，新的统一的政府是由日、法、英、美等帝国主义的代理人组成的，是服务于这群利害冲突的主子的，它将继续接受帝国主义者的命令，镇压中国民族求解放的任何一种形式的群众运动。”
    最后，她写道：“我不忍见孙中山四十年的工作被一小撮自私自利的国民党军阀、政客所毁坏。我更不忍见四万万七千五百万人的中国，因国民党背弃自己的主义而亡于帝国主义。”
    “因此，我不得不率直地宣布，既然组织国民党的目的是以它为革命的机器，既然它未能完成它所以被创造起来的任务，我们对它的灭亡也就不必婉惜。”
    她以对于人民革命事业的无比的信心继续写道：
    “我坚决地相信：只有以群众为基础并为群众服务的革命，才能粉碎军阀、政客的权力，才能摆脱帝国主义的枷锁，才能真正实行社会主义。我深信：虽然今天当权的反动势力在进行恐怖活动，中国千百万真正的革命者必不放弃自己的责任；反之，由于国家当前形势的危急，他们将加紧工作，朝着革命所树立的目标胜利前进。”
    历史是这个勇敢的战士的卓越见解和坚固信心的有力的见证。在她发表这篇论文的十八年以后，中国千百万真正的革命者和全体企望摆脱帝国主义枷锁的人民终于在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下获得了革命的辉煌的胜利。
    “国民党已不再是一个政治力量”一文显然结束了作者自居为国民党左派的时期。她开始独立地进行与人民的革命斗争及世界保卫和平运动有广泛联系的各种实际活动。为了反抗蒋介石政权的恐怖统治，在一九三二年，她和鲁迅、杨铨等发起组织“中国民权保障同盟”。在“中国民权保障同盟的任务”一文中，她大声疾呼说：
    “我们要求释放一切政治犯。他们不是罪犯，他们是人类解放斗争的先驱者。……中国人民的精华在监狱中被摧残得奄奄一息；而流氓、军阀、职业政客、资本家和封建地主却把持政府中的要职，把我们的国家奉送给帝国主义。这真是无比的丑行。如果要中国不成为一个被奴役的国家，我们释放所有政治犯的要求就是革命上必要的要求。”
    作者热烈地颂扬苏联的真正的民主制度，并且指摘资本主义国家的所谓民主，认为这种民主“不过是严密保障着一小撮剥削者的权势的一种制度。”而国民党的所谓法律更是“公开地、无耻地为极少数的封建地主、资本家和帝国主义者的利益服务”的工具。
    人民的民主权利是不容侵犯的。她对国民党反动派发出警告说：
    “那些自以为可以无限期延长他们对人民的血腥统治的人是大错特错了。人民大众一定要为他们的基本权利而斗争。这个斗争会加强起来，会席卷全国，会使中国强大和统一。……”
    自一九三一年日本侵占东北后，民族危机日益严重。在这时期，宋庆龄先生为响应中国共产党提出的停止内战一致抗日的主张并争取其实现而进行了巨大斗争。
    在“中国的工人们，团结起来！”一文中，作者指出决不能依靠蒋介石政府来进行抗日战争。她写道：
    “蒋介石政府不能统一中国，不能领导武装人民进行抵抗日本帝国主义的民族革命战争，不能给农民土地。为什么不能呢？因为它总是想对帝国主义妥协。因为它怕武装的人民甚于帝国主义侵略者，因为它是欺压群众、祸国殃民的地主和资产阶级集团的代表。”
    她认为只有工人阶级领导下的广大农民群众才是战胜日本帝国主义的不可抗拒的力量。她坚决反对蒋介石政府的反共战争，号召全国人民起来制止国民党反动派对以江西为中心的中国红色区域的进攻。在一九三三年上海反战大会上发表的演词“中国的自由与反战斗争”中，她指出：“广大的苏维埃区域已经在中国存在了许多年，这个事实便是广大的中国人民将走上这同一条道路的希望、诺言和保证。”在这个不顾国民党区白色恐怖而举行的秘密的反战大会上，她反复地申述了革命阶级和被压迫人民为反抗压迫和争取民族解放进行武装斗争的必要性，“因为反动势力永远不会自动放弃它们的权力”。最后，她向全国人民呼吁说：
    “让我们团结起来，向那些背叛国家，把我们的国土一省一省地出卖给帝国主义者的人们作斗争！让我们团结起来，用我们最大的力量来保卫那已经由帝国主义统治和封建剥削的羁绊中解放出来的中国工人和农民，他们现在正受着国民党军队第五次而且是最大规模的进攻。这次的进攻直接受到美国贷与蒋介石政府的五千万美元中一千六百万美元的帮助，受到美国的飞机、炸弹和飞行教练的帮助，受到日、英、美、法的军舰对国民党的全力帮助（如最近的闽变），受到帝国主义各色各样物质的与精神的帮助。”
    在一九三七年国民党的三中全会上，她严正地斥责那些反共分子说：“在今天居然还可以听到‘抗日必先剿共’的老调，这是多么荒谬！我们要先打断一只手臂之后再去抗日吗？”（“实行孙中山的遗嘱”）
    在抗日战争中，作者是中国共产党的统一战线政策和八路军新四军的积极支持者和宣传者。“关于国共合作的声明”表明了她积极拥护抗日民族统一战线的立场。她反对国民党破坏团结破坏抗战的阴谋。在“中国需要更多的民主”一文中，她指出，“抗日民族统一战线并不是说各个属于它的党派不能有各自的观点和目标。并不意味着任何一党一派的独裁。”“缺乏民主使妥协派和求和派能够在暗中活动，准备投降；他们当中有很多人不仅与敌人勾结，并且还与罗马—柏林—东京轴心反人类进步的整个阴谋有联系。”在“给中国在海外的朋友们的公开信”中，她声明她所领导的保卫中国同盟必须把救济工作的重点放在八路军和新四军所创造的解放区。她说：
    “我们所以把重点放在游击区，是因为他们虽然牵制了并且仍在牵制着日本在中国几乎一半的兵力，但是他们已经有三年没有得到过任何武器和金钱的援助，以及与我们的工作特别有关的医药援助。西班牙单独在欧洲武装反抗法西斯的时候，不幸的‘不干涉’政策使它得不到武器。而今天最沉重地打击日本法西斯在中国的阵地的军队，却遇到一个更严厉、更残忍的‘不干涉’政策。国内政治的封锁使他们没有医生、外科器械和药品；甚至由国外友人送来的，他们也得不到。我们并不要求给他们优先待遇，而是要求平等待遇，要求取消封锁，并吁请大家不要对封锁默许。”
    在抗日战争结束以后，作者是美国援助蒋介石进行内战阴谋的反对者。在“关于促成组织联合政府并呼吁美国人民制止他们的政府在军事上援助国民党的声明”中，作者写道：
    “美国人民是中国人民的盟友和老友，我们必须明白地告诉他们，这是一条灾难的道路。必须告诉他们，美国的反动分子正在与中国的反动分子互相勾结，狼狈为奸。必须告诉他们，目前在中国境内的美国军队并不在加强中国人民的安宁。必须忠告他们，所有的借款只能借给人民所承认的真正代表人民的政府。必须告诉他们，如果美国能明白表示不再供给军火和军事援助，那末，中国的内战就决不会扩大。”
    在一九四九年全国解放以后，作者以对于革命人民的火热的感情发表了许多歌颂新中国和争取世界和平的有力的作品。这些作品是广大读者所传诵的壮丽的诗篇。关于这些近年来的作品，已不需要在这篇短文中多作介绍了。
    “为新中国奋斗”是一本战斗的、热情洋溢的书。这本书的出版是一个值得欢迎的事件。我们深信中国和世界人民都将从这本书受到鼓舞，获得创造和平幸福生活的力量。
