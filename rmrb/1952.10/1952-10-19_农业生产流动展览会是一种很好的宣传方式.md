    Agricultural Production Mobile Exhibition is a Good Way to Publicize

    To the Editor: In order to further break the conservative thinking of farmers in production and set off a higher upsurge of patriotic production increase, the People's Government of Liling County, Hunan Province, specially organized an agricultural production mobile exhibition, which is being exhibited in key areas in all districts and townships of the county in rotation. This method has been very effective.

    The main contents of the exhibition are: (1) An explanation of the ten major production policies for 1952; (2) Li Chenggui's experience in high-yield rice; (3) Specimens of diseases and insect pests; (4) Agricultural tools of today's Soviet Union. In addition, there are current affairs news on the issue of the worker-peasant alliance. These contents are presented in photos, posters, comic strips, slides, and physical objects, with concise and popular text annotations. Despite being in the busy farming season, the broad masses still spare time to visit. There are always seven or eight hundred people attending every day, and more than a thousand at times. Three farmers in Dazhang Township, who didn't have time during the day, came with horse lanterns at night and copied some production experiences and methods to take back. Several old farmers over seventy years old dispelled their concerns about "more production, more burden" after listening to the explanation of the production policy by the commentator. Some farmers who only knew part of Li Chenggui's high-yield experience in the past said after watching the comic strips: We have learned the whole set of skills. Some farmers are determined to organize themselves to purchase new agricultural tools and pesticides, and actively increase production. After visiting the exhibition, many rural cadres wrote in the opinion book: We must lead the masses to do a good job in production.

    Liling County is now preparing for a larger agricultural production mobile exhibition.

    We believe that this kind of agricultural production mobile exhibition is a good way to publicize production policies, knowledge, and technology to the masses, and we specially write it out for rural areas everywhere to refer to and try to implement.

    农业生产流动展览会是一种很好的宣传方式
    编辑同志：湖南醴陵县人民政府为了进一步打破农民在生产上的保守思想，掀起更高的爱国增产热潮，特地举办了一个农业生产流动展览会，有重点地轮流在全县各区、乡进行展览。这个办法收效很大。
    展览会的主要内容有：（一）关于一九五二年的生产十大政策的说明；（二）李呈桂水稻丰收的经验；（三）病虫害标本；（四）今日苏联的农具。此外，还有关于工农联盟问题等的时事新闻。这些内容用照片、挂图、连环画、幻灯和实物表现出来，并有简明通俗的文字加以注释，广大群众虽在农忙期间，还是挤出时间前来参观。每天总有七、八百人到会，多时在一千人以上。大璋乡有三个农民，白天没有时间，晚上提着马灯来看，并且把一些生产上的经验和办法抄录回去。有好几个七十岁以上的老农民听了讲解员解释生产政策，打消了“多增产多负担”的顾虑。有些农民过去只知道李呈桂丰产的部分经验，这回看了连环画，都说：整套本领都学会了。有些农民决心组织起来购买新农具和药械，积极增产。很多农村干部参观了展览会后，在意见簿上写道：要领导群众搞好生产。
    现在醴陵县正在筹备一个更大的农业生产流动展览会。
    我们认为，这种农业生产流动展览会是向群众宣传生产政策、知识、技术的一个好方法，特写出来供各地农村参考试办。
