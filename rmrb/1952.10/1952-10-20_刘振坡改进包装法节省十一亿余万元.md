    Liu Zhenpo Improves Packaging Methods, Saving Over 1.1 Billion Yuan

    To the Editor: Liu Zhenpo, the deputy section chief of the packing room at the Jiang ○ Three One Factory in Wuhan, has improved packing work and saved the country more than 1.1 billion yuan during two cotton clothing packing assignments, while also reducing the number of workers needed by more than forty.

    In the past, the work in the packing room was very chaotic. The production responsibility system and the statistical system were not well established. After the folding and packing workers had packed the clothes, no one checked the quantity and quality. Errors in size, quantity, and record-keeping, as well as rework, occurred frequently. Also, because of the fear of damaging the buttons on the clothes, they dared not compress the clothing packages as much as possible. As a result, the clothing packages were loose and large, wasting countless packaging materials.

    This February, Liu Zhenpo constantly studied and found the reasons why the buttons were easily damaged and the clothing could not be compressed as much as possible: The wooden boards of the pressing machine lacked elasticity. Therefore, he and his comrades immediately nailed cotton and cowhide elastic devices onto the upper and lower boards of the pressing machine, reducing the hardness of the pressing plates of the packing machine. They also improved the folding methods, using several layers of clothing to protect the buttons as much as possible, and paying attention to preventing the buttons of two pieces of clothing from pressing against each other, thus compressing the packaging volume. The original packaging volume of single clothing, 4.5 cubic feet, was changed to 3.625 cubic feet. The cotton clothing package was compressed from one foot and three inches high to seven inches high, while ensuring that the buttons were not damaged. The original regulation was ten pieces per cotton coat package, but now the number has been increased to fourteen pieces per package.

### 刘振坡改进包装法节省十一亿余万元

    刘振坡改进包装法节省十一亿余万元
    编辑同志：武汉市江○三一工厂打包室副室长刘振坡，改进包装工作，在两次包装单服棉服任务中，为国家节省了十一亿一千余万元，还少用了四十多名工人。
    从前打包室的工作非常混乱。生产责任制度和统计制度都没有很好的建立。叠包员把衣服包叠好之后，无人检查数量和质量，经常发生错号、错数、错账及返工现象，又因为怕压坏衣服扣子，不敢尽量压缩衣包，因此，衣包又松又大，浪费了无数的包装材料。
    今年二月，刘振坡不断钻研，找出了容易压坏扣子和不能尽量压缩的原因：是压包机的木板没有收缩性，于是，他和同志们马上把压包机上下板上钉上了棉花和牛皮的弹性的装置，减少了打包机压板的硬度，并又改善了叠包方法，尽量用数层衣服保护扣子，并注意把两件衣服扣子不互相压在一起，因此压缩了包装体积。由原来单衣包装体积四点五立方市尺，改为三点六二五立方市尺。棉衣包由一尺三寸高，压到七寸高，并保证不压坏扣子。棉大衣原来规定每包十件，现增到每包能装十四件。
