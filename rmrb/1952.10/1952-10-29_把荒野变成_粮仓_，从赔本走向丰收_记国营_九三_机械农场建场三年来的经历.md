    Turning Wilderness into a "Granary", Moving from Losses to Harvests
    —A Record of the State-Run "93" Mechanized Farm's Experiences in the First Three Years
    Ding Lüshu
    Here, at 49 degrees north latitude on the western foothills of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, lies the Nenjiang grassland, part of the "Great Northern Wilderness." Three or four years ago, this was still a desolate wilderness, sparsely populated, with wolves, badgers, foxes, and roe deer running rampant. Now, a large-scale mechanized state-run farm has emerged here – the State-Run "93" Farm. It has developed 10,000 hectares of fertile land and constructed 11,000 square meters of new-style housing. Fully mechanized agricultural production has transformed this wilderness into a "granary" producing ten thousand tons of grain annually.

    This spring, the farm participated in the joint patriotic production increase competition challenge issued to brother farms across the country. The original challenge plan stipulated that the yield of all land should exceed that of last year and be 20% higher than the yield of local farmers. The "93" Farm successfully overfulfilled this plan. They planted 5,700 hectares of spring wheat and achieved an overall bumper harvest, averaging 1,400 kilograms (2,800 *jin*) per hectare, an increase of over 174% compared to last year's yield (510 kilograms per hectare), and 30% higher than the average wheat yield of local farmers.

    Improving Farming Methods, Increasing Yields

    In the autumn of 1949, hundreds of workers came here to begin building the farm. They erected many tents on this wild grassland, and dozens of car drivers drove tractors they had never driven before to start reclaiming the autumn wilderness. Winter comes early to the "Great Northern Wilderness"; by October, it was already snowing heavily. That winter, there were not enough houses, so many people still lived in tents, using their blood to resist the minus 40-degree cold. However, when they first arrived that autumn, no one understood the effectiveness of agricultural machinery. They unloaded the plowshares and coulters from the five-bottom plows, using only the moldboard to plow the land. Although they opened up 2,000 hectares of wasteland that autumn, they only reached a depth of 15 or 16 centimeters. The quality of land preparation was poor, and weeds grew everywhere. When harrowing, they only knew to harrow along the ridges, but this did not break up the soil at all. At that time, they also did not know what was the appropriate sowing depth and seed quantity. In the first year, some wheat was sown at a depth of 12 centimeters, with an average of only three million seeds sown per hectare, and some as few as just over two million. As a result, the yield was pitifully low. In 1950, the average wheat yield was only 816.26 kilograms per hectare. Everyone then realized that improving farming methods and increasing yields was an overridingly serious issue. However, some people still had conservative ideas and were afraid to boldly improve technology. Some people believed that deep plowing was not suitable for local conditions, arguing that deeper plowing would cause the crops to "grow greedily" (grow more branches and leaves and fewer seeds), which would affect the yield. The basis of this argument was that "the farmers in this area have never plowed so deep." But they did not understand that farmers using old-fashioned wooden plows simply could not achieve deep plowing. Some comrades also believed that this area was suitable for the so-called "dry farming method" and that ridges must be made. For this purpose, they had made the Shenyang Agricultural Implement Factory spend a lot of effort researching seeders suitable for ridging. In 1951, the wheat growth was still not good. In addition, it rained when the wheat ripened, and the wheat only yielded 510 kilograms per hectare. At this time, everyone gradually realized from practical experience that the Soviet deep plowing, flat sowing, and dense planting were the most advanced and valuable experiences. When plowing this year, they put all the coulters and plowshares back on the five-bottom plows, increasing the plowing depth to over 23 centimeters. In terms of sowing technology, everyone also found experiences that were in line with local realities. For the main crop—wheat—everyone knew that the sowing depth of three to five centimeters was the most suitable, and the sowing amount was 4.5 million to 5 million seeds per hectare.

    The bumper harvest of 5,700 hectares of wheat this year fully demonstrates that improving farming methods is the key to increasing yields. Some of the wheat fields were planted with the Soviet "Lyutestsens 62" variety and were cultivated relatively well, with a yield of 5,600 *jin* per hectare. From this fact, all the farm workers recognized another problem: this year's average yield (2,800 *jin* per hectare) could still be greatly improved. Therefore, everyone paid more attention to improving agricultural technology.

    Improving Mechanical Technology, Overcoming Waste

    In the early stages of the farm's construction, because everyone did not understand agricultural machinery, machine parts were often damaged, and accidents occurred constantly. One Nazi tractor plowed the land with a five-bottom plow, but not only removed the plowshares and coulters, but also unloaded one of the moldboards, turning a good five-bottom plow into a "four-bottom plow." At that time, people also did not understand combined operations. One tractor ran around the field with only one seeder, seriously wasting fuel. However, these pioneers did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties. They constantly summarized experiences and lessons and constantly studied diligently. Now, this farm has trained more than 400 tractor drivers and more than 40 cadres who can master the operation and mechanical technology of a mechanized farming team. Last year, only 80 people could operate combines; this year, there are already 108 people. Thus, not only are there enough personnel to manage 10,000 hectares of land, but also a group of people have been sent to work in other areas.

    In the upsurge of learning and studying technology, everyone has mastered skilled mechanical technology and brought the effectiveness of machinery into play. Now, one Nazi tractor can connect and pull four seeders or three disc harrows; the quality of tillage has also fully met the standards. When harvesting wheat in 1950, each Stalin No. 6 combine could only harvest an average of 1,100 kilograms per hour; in 1952, it reached 2,200 kilograms. There has also been great progress in mechanical repair.

    Technological progress has increased mechanical efficiency to a relatively high degree. In 1952, the farm managed 10,000 hectares of land, using a total of 60 tractors, mainly 37 Nazi tractors. These 37 Nazis had to bear 37,019 standard *mu* (soft hectares) [Note] of operations; according to operating time, each machine averaged 1,170 hours of operation per year.

    During this year's wheat harvest, they launched the "Red Flag Wheat Sea Competition" movement. The farm had a total of 5,700 hectares of wheat and 46 combines; the task for each was more than 120 hectares. On the eve of the wheat harvest, most comrades believed that the mechanical efficiency was not high, and they were afraid that they would not be able to complete the task. They expressed doubt about the operating quota. Driver Zhang Yukun (a member of the Communist Youth League) and combine operator Lou Ying's locomotive group recognized early on that the mechanical efficiency was not low, but that the machinery was damaged because everyone did not pay attention to maintenance. They strengthened the repair and maintenance of the combine and implemented a dedicated responsibility system and a "people look for faults, don't let faults look for people" work method. Therefore, at the beginning of the wheat harvest, they broke through the quota of 21 tons of wheat harvested per day per combine stipulated by the State Farm Administration Bureau, and then created a new record of harvesting 40.41 tons per day. This fact eliminated the ideological obstacles of all the staff. Everyone learned from the working methods of Zhang Yukun's locomotive group and successfully completed the wheat harvest task. Zhang Yukun's locomotive group won the red flag of the "Wheat Sea Competition," and their combine was honorably named "Reporting Victory to Chairman Mao." They had the least losses in harvesting, completed the most tasks, and saved the most fuel. The total wheat harvest loss of the farm this time was 503 tons, accounting for about 7% of the total output. Zhang Yukun's locomotive group had a loss rate of only 1.45%; if the entire farm could reduce the loss rate to 1.45%, it could harvest an additional 420 tons of wheat. The quota for the use of oil was stipulated as 5 kilograms per ton of wheat harvested; Zhang Yukun's locomotive group only used 3.42 kilograms, a reduction of 30%; if the entire farm could reduce fuel consumption by 30%, including the reduction in harvesting losses, the entire farm could increase production and save more than 700 million *yuan* in this wheat harvest. Reducing losses and saving fuel are really issues that deserve special attention.

    In the past three years, many distressing things have happened on this farm. At one point, a large number of tractors arrived, but there was a shortage of towed agricultural implements, and many tractors were left unused. A large amount of soybeans were planted, but there was a lack of preparations for weeding, and the staff had no way of finding the crops in the grass. In 1951, 7,000 hectares of wheat were planted, but there was a lack of preparation for the wheat harvest. When the wheat ripened, it rained continuously, the machines could not go to the ground, and as a result, more than 40% of the total output was lost. In terms of operation and management, the responsible cadres had serious supply system thinking, only knowing to ask the superiors for money and machines. When too many machines came, they could not be used, not only paying a lot of money for repairs and maintenance, but also seriously tying up funds. In 1951, more than 3 billion *yuan* of fixed capital was tied up in machinery.

    In the past three years, they have learned lessons from many distressing things and gradually found the direction of progress. A basic lesson that everyone has summarized is that establishing a new farm must first have precise investigation and research, formulate strict plans, and advance step by step. Everyone also recognizes that the most serious problems at present are eliminating waste and increasing production.

    Cultivation and Operation Management Still Need to Be Improved

    There are still some problems with the "93" farm in terms of farming methods and operation and management: the yield is not high enough, and consumption should be reduced. This year, every hectare harvested 2,800 *jin* of wheat, and the production cost was 2,000 *jin*; although it is no longer losing money, the proportion of costs is still too large. In order to solve these problems, they have made several decisions:

    1. Starting next year, implement an eight-year crop rotation system with large fields of pasture. Three years of experience have proven that implementing scientific farming methods is the main key to increasing yields. Implementing a "grass-crop rotation system" can systematically change the soil structure and increase soil fertility in accordance with scientific methods, gradually increasing the yield to a higher level.

    2. Implement diversified operations combining agriculture and animal husbandry. In the past, this farm only grew crops. In the past three years, they have found that this kind of operation is unscientific. The shortcomings of this operating method are first manifested in the allocation of labor—there is a shortage of labor during busy farming seasons, and a large amount of labor is idle during slack farming seasons. At the same time, due to the long production process, the turnover of working capital is slow, with only one cycle per year. They plan to develop animal husbandry starting next year to rationally adjust labor, accelerate the turnover of funds, and closely combine with the grass-crop rotation system.

    3. Implement a work system of guaranteed output, guaranteed cost, special area and special responsibility, and all-inclusive responsibility. They plan to divide the land into areas starting next year, with
    one mechanized farming team as a unit, responsible for farming to the end. In terms of cost expenditure, they must stipulate a quota. The repair and maintenance costs of each tractor and the consumption of oil are all discussed by everyone to determine a standard quota. Then, according to the provisions of the quota, the work units are paid with "promissory notes," and they receive oil and materials for repairing machinery with "promissory notes." This will enable everyone to have a clear understanding of the numbers and strengthen the idea of economic accounting. Output quotas are also set. In order to ensure the good implementation of these systems, they have also formulated reward and punishment measures. The implementation of this system will enable all the masses on the farm to participate in operation and management and work together to complete the country's production tasks.

    Leading Neighboring Farmers to Advance Together

    The farmers see the mechanized production and often say with envy, "The machine turns around once, it's worth half a year of our work." This is indeed the case. Taking the Nazi tractor as an example, it pulls four seeders, sowing 96 rows at a time, and can sow more than 60 hectares a day; this is equivalent to the labor of 180 people and 180 livestock. Isn't that equivalent to more than half a year? Taking the Stalin No. 6 combine as an example, one machine can harvest more than 20 hectares of wheat a day, and combine reaping and threshing; this is equivalent to the labor of 250 people and many livestock. Isn't that even more than half a year? From the perspective of production capacity, each person on a mechanized farm can cultivate at least 15 hectares of land. From the perspective of harvest volume, each hectare can currently harvest nearly 3,000 *jin* of soybeans or wheat. In this way, one laborer can produce 45,000 *jin* of grain per year. In the future, continuously improving mechanical efficiency and improving farming methods, the yield will be even higher. This is something that individual farmers cannot compare with. In this area, a farmer, plus all the women, children, and old people in the family, busy themselves, and use their own livestock, can only cultivate 4 hectares a year; due to the backwardness of the production method, the harvest on the same area is half less than mechanized production.

    The farmers near the "93" Farm have gradually improved their understanding of mechanized collectivization. This year, the farmers of Xinsheng Village, Nenjiang Third District, organized a collective farm under the leadership of the Party—the Xinsheng Collective Farm. They signed a contract with the "93" Farm to use the farm's machinery for cultivation, and the production capacity has increased by 50%. In the past, one laborer could only cultivate 4 hectares of land; in the first year of using machines, it increased to 6 hectares, and the yield also increased greatly. This not only brought the farmers of the Xinsheng Collective Farm closer to greater happiness, but more importantly, it pointed out a way forward for the vast number of farmers. In the past, because there were still many shortcomings in the farm, there was a lot of waste, the output was not high, and there was no conscious connection with the peasant masses, its demonstration and educational role was not very great. This situation has begun to change this year. In the future, it will better and more unite the local farmers around itself and lead them to gradually embark on the road of mechanized collectivization.

    [Note] A standard *mu* is called a "soft hectare" in the Soviet Union; it is based on the standard of one hectare of cultivated land by a tractor, and all different operations throughout the year are converted into a unified unit of one hectare of cultivated land.

    把荒野变成“粮仓”，从赔本走向丰收
    ——记国营“九三”机械农场建场三年来的经历
    丁履枢
    这里是北纬四十九度小兴安岭西麓的嫩江草原，也是“北大荒”的一部分。三、四年以前，这里还是一片荒芜的原野，人烟稀少，狼、獾、狐狸、狍子到处奔跑。现在，这里已经出现了一个规模宏大的机械化国营农场——国营“九三”农场。它已经开发了一万公顷肥沃的耕地，建设了一万一千平方公尺的新式房舍。全部机械化的农业生产，把这一片荒野变成了一个年产万吨粮食的“粮仓”。
    今年春天，这个农场参加了联名向全国兄弟农场提出的爱国增产竞赛的挑战。原来的挑战计划中规定：全部土地产量要超过去年，要比当地农民的产量高出百分之二十。“九三”农场胜利地超额完成了这个计划。他们种了五千七百公顷春小麦，得到了全面的丰收，平均每公顷收获了一千四百公斤
    （二千八百市斤），比去年的产量（每公顷收获五百一十公斤）增加了百分之一百七十四强，超过当地农民小麦平均产量百分之三十。
    改进耕作方法，提高产量
    一九四九年的秋天，几百名职工来到这里，开始建设农场。他们在这荒草野甸上架起了许多帐篷，几十名汽车司机驾驶着从来没有驾驶过的拖拉机，开始开垦秋荒。“北大荒”的冬天来得很早，十月间就已是大雪纷飞的季节。那年冬天，房子少，住不下，许多人仍然住在帐篷里，用热血抵挡零下四十度的严寒。可是，在那年秋天初来的时候，谁也不懂得农业机械的效能，他们把五铧犁的犁刀和小铧全部卸了下来，只用大铧耕地。头一年秋天虽然开了两千公顷荒地，但只达到十五、六公分深。整地质量低劣，杂草丛生。耙地的时候，他们只知道顺垅耙，但这样耙过去，根本没有起到碎土的作用。对于播种的深度和种籽的数量，那时也不知道怎样才是合适的。头一年有的小麦播了十二公分深，平均每公顷只播种了三百万粒种子，有的竟少至二百多万粒。结果，产量低得可怜，一九五○年平均每公顷小麦只收了八百一十六点二六公斤。大家这时才认识到改进耕作方法、提高产量是一个压倒一切的严重问题。可是，部分人员还是有保守思想，不敢大胆地改进技术。有些人认为耕深不适宜于当地的条件，耕深了庄稼要“贪青”（多长枝叶，少长籽粒），会影响产量。这一部分同志的根据是“这一带的农民从来没有耕过那么深”。但他们并不了解农民用旧式木犁，根本不可能作到深耕。还有一些同志认为这个地方适宜用所谓“干燥农作法”，必须起垅。为了这个目的，他们曾经使沈阳农具工厂花费了很多精力，研究适合于起垅作业的播种机。一九五一年，小麦成长状况仍然不好。加以麦熟时下了雨，每公顷小麦只收了五百一十公斤。这时候，大家从实际体验中，逐步认识到苏联的深耕、平播、密植是最先进最宝贵的经验。到今年耕地时，才把五铧犁全部带上了小铧和犁刀，使耕地深度达到了二十三公分以上。在播种技术上，大家也摸着了切合当地实际情况的经验。以主要作物——小麦来说，大家知道了播种深度以三公分到五公分为最合适，播种量每公顷以四百五十万粒到五百万粒为合适。
    今年五千七百公顷小麦的丰收，充分说明了改进耕作方法是提高产量的关键。一部分麦田种的是苏联“留特斯广斯六二号”品种，而且耕作得比较好，每公顷产量达到了五千六百斤。全场职工们从这个事实上又认识了一个问题：今年的平均产量（每垧二千八百斤），还是可以大大提高的。因此，大家就更注意改进农作技术了。
    提高机械技术，克服浪费
    这个农场在建场初期，因为大家都不懂得农业机械，时常弄坏机件，不断发生事故。有一台纳齐拖拉机带五铧犁耕地，不但摘掉了犁刀、小铧，而且卸去了一个铧子，把好好的五铧犁弄成了“四铧犁”。那时人们也不懂得联结作业，一个拖拉机只带着一台播种机满地跑，严重地浪费了燃料。但是，这些拓荒者没有在困难面前低头。他们不断总结经验教训，不断苦心钻研学习。到现在，这个农场里已经锻炼出来了四百多名拖拉机驾驶员，和四十多个能掌握一个机耕队的作业和机械技术的干部。去年，能操作康拜因的只有八十个人，今年已达到了一百零八人。这样，不但有了经营一万公顷土地所需要的足够的人员，而且还输送了一批人员到其他地区去工作。
    在学习、钻研技术的热潮中，大家已经掌握了熟练的机械技术，发挥了机械的效能。现在，一台纳齐拖拉机能联结牵引四台播种机，或三台圆盘耙；在耕作质量上，也完全达到了标准。一九五○年收割小麦，每台斯大林六号康拜因每小时平均只能收打一千一百公斤，一九五二年达到了二千二百公斤。在机械修理方面也有了很大的进步。
    技术的进步使机械效率提高到了较高的程度。一九五二年全场经营一万公顷土地，共用六十台拖拉机，以三十七台纳齐拖拉机为主力。这三十七台纳齐要担负三万七千零十九个标准垧（软公顷）〔注〕的作业；按照作业时间计算，每台机器全年平均作业时间为一千一百七十小时。
    在今年麦收的时候，他们展开了“麦海红旗竞赛”运动。全场共有五千七百公顷小麦，四十六台康拜因；每台的任务是一百二十多公顷。在麦收的前夕，大多数同志都认为机械效率不高，恐怕完不成任务，对于作业的定额，都表示怀疑。驾驶员张玉崑（青年团员）和康拜因手娄英同志的机车组，很早就认识了机械效率并不低，只是由于大家不注意保养，把机械搞坏了。他们加强了康拜因的修理和保养工作，实行了专责制和“人找故障，不叫故障找人”的工作方法。因此，麦收一开头，他们就突破了国营农场管理局规定的每台康拜因每天收打二十一吨小麦的定额，接着，又创造了每天收割四十点四一吨的新纪录。这个事实扫除了全场人员的思想障碍。大家都学习张玉崑机车组的工作方法，顺利地完成了麦收任务。张玉崑的机车组夺得了“麦海竞赛”的红旗，他们的康拜因被光荣地命名为“向毛主席报捷号”。他们在收割中损失最少，完成任务最多，节省燃料也最多。这次全场的麦收损失为五百零三吨，约占总产量的百分之七。张玉崑机车组的损失率只有百分之一点四五；如果全场都能把损失率降低为百分之一点四五，就可以多打四百二十吨小麦。使用油料的定额，规定每收打一吨小麦用五公斤，张玉昆机车组只用了三点四二公斤，降低了百分之三十；如果全场都能把油料消耗降低百分之三十，连同收割损失的减少，全农场在这一次麦收中就可以增产节约七亿元以上。减少损失和节约燃料，实在是一个值得特别重视的问题。
    三年里，这个农场中还发生过不少令人痛心的事情。有一个时期，来了大批的拖拉机，但是缺乏牵引的农具，许多拖拉机放着用不上。播种了大量的大豆，但是缺乏除草的准备，职工们在草里找庄稼，弄得毫无办法。一九五一年种了七千公顷小麦，但是缺乏麦收的准备；麦子熟了的时候，阴雨连绵，机器下不了地，结果损失了总产量的百分之四十以上。在经营管理上，负责干部有严重的供给制思想，只知道向上级要钱要机器；机器来多了，用不了，不但大量地支付了修理维护的费用，而且严重地积压了资金。一九五一年在机械方面曾积压固定资金三十多亿元。
    三年里，他们从许多痛心的事情中取得了教训，渐渐地摸着了前进的方向。大家总结出的一条基本的教训是：建立一个新的农场，必须先有精密的调查研究，拟定严格的计划，有步骤地前进。大家也认识了当前最严重的问题，就是消灭浪费，提高产量。
    耕作和经营管理还要继续改进
    “九三”农场在耕作方法上和经营管理上仍然存在着一些问题：产量还不够高，消耗还应该降低。今年每公顷收获麦子二千八百斤，生产成本就要两千斤；虽然不再赔钱了，但成本所占比例还是太大。他们为了解决这些问题，作出了几项决定：
    一、从明年开始，实行牧草大田八年轮作制。三年来的经验证明了实行科学的耕作方法，是提高产量的主要关键。实行“草田轮作制”，就可以有计划地依照科学的方法，改变土壤结构，增加土地肥沃度，逐渐把产量提高到更高的水平。
    二、实行农牧结合的多角经营。过去这个农场只是种地。在这三年中，他们发现了这样经营是不科学的。这种经营方法的缺点，首先表现在劳动力的配备上——农忙时候感到劳力不足，农闲时期又闲着大批劳力。同时，由于生产过程漫长，流动资金周转迟缓，一年只有一个周期。他们计划从明年开始发展畜牧业，合理地调剂劳力，加速资金的周转，并且可以和草田轮作制密切结合起来。
    三、实行包产量、包成本、专区专责、一包到底的作业制度。他们计划从明年开始把土地划成区，
    一个机耕队为一个单位，负责包耕到底。在成本支出方面，要规定定额。每台拖拉机的修理保养费和油料的消耗，都由大家讨论定出标准的定额。然后根据定额的规定，付给各作业单位以“本票”，凭
    “本票”领油、领修理机械的材料。这样就可以使大家心中有数，加强经济核算的思想。在产量上，也定出了定额。为了保证很好地执行这些制度，他们还制定了奖惩办法。实行这种制度，就可以使全场群众都参加经营管理，同心协力完成国家的生产任务。
    带领附近农民一同前进
    农民们看到机械化的生产，常常很羡慕地说：“机器转一转，顶咱干半年。”事实就是如此。就以纳齐拖拉机来说，它牵引四台播种机，一播九十六行，一天能播种六十多公顷；这就相当于一百八十个人工和一百八十个畜工的劳动。这不是相当于大半年吗？再以斯大林六号康拜因来说，一台机器一天能收割二十多公顷小麦，而且连割带打；这就相当于二百五十个人工和许多畜工的劳动。这不更是一个大半年吗？从生产能力来看，机械农场每一个人，最少能耕种十五公顷土地。从收获量来看，目前每一公顷就能收获近三千斤大豆或小麦。这样，一个劳动力每年就能生产四万五千斤粮食。今后不断地提高机械效能，改进耕作方法，产量将会更加提高。这更是个体农民没法比的。这一带地方，一个农民，加上全家妇女老小，忙忙碌碌，再用上自己的牲畜，一年只能耕种四公顷；由于生产方式的落后，在同样的面积上的收获量要比机械化生产少一半。
    “九三”农场附近的农民们逐渐提高了对机械化集体化的认识。今年，嫩江三区新胜村的农民，在党的领导之下，组织起来一个集体农庄——新生集体农庄。他们和“九三”农场订立了合同，使用农场的机器耕种，生产能力已经提高了百分之五十。过去一个劳动力只能耕种四公顷土地；使用机器的头一年，就提高到六公顷，而且产量也大为提高了。这不仅使新生集体农庄的农民向更大的幸福走近了一步，更重要的是给广大的农民指出了一条前进的道路。过去，因为农场内部还有很多缺点，浪费很大，产量不高，也没有有意识地联系农民群众，它起的示范和教育作用还不很大。今年，这种情况已开始改变了。今后，它将更好地更多地把当地农民团结在自己的周围，带动他们逐步走向机械化集体化的道路。
    〔注〕标准垧在苏联叫“软公顷”；就是以拖拉机耕熟地一公顷为标准，把全年不同的作业都折合成耕熟地一公顷的统一单位。
