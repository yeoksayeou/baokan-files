Dear comrades!

Today is the second anniversary of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers going abroad to fight, a day that the Korean people will never forget.

During the most difficult period of the Korean people's just struggle against the armed intervention of the American and British imperialists, the great Chinese people, holding high the banner of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country, sent their outstanding sons and daughters to the Korean front and directly aided the Korean people with their blood.

This momentous October 25th, two years ago, reversed the course of the Korean war against aggression and became the turning point to ensure final victory.

Since then, for two years, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have fought shoulder to shoulder in close cooperation, dealing heavy blows to the enemy who boasted of being powerful, driving them back south of the 38th parallel from the area north of the Chongchon River, and establishing a stalemate along the 38th parallel.

This has allowed the people of North Korea to restore their democratic and free life. Therefore, the Korean people warmly congratulate the great victory of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers in resisting America and aiding Korea. We extend our gratitude and respect to the great Chinese people who sent their beloved sons and husbands to the Korean front, and we extend our heartfelt gratitude and respect to the great Chairman Mao Zedong, who consistently and deeply cares about resisting America and aiding Korea.

On behalf of the Korean people, I once again extend my sincere gratitude and high respect to Commander Peng Dehuai of the loyal and heroic sons and daughters of the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and to the great Chinese people and their leader, Chairman Mao Zedong.

Dear comrades!

In the arduous struggle against the American imperialist aggressors, the Chinese and Korean peoples have not only gloriously defended the freedom and independence of their motherlands, but have also demonstrated the superiority of the people's democratic system, further consolidated the political and ideological unity of the people, and made great contributions to the cause of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the great Chinese people have achieved brilliant successes in large-scale national construction. This struggle for national construction, together with the movement to resist America and aid Korea, has spread like wildfire throughout every corner of China, and the Chinese working people have displayed unparalleled patriotic enthusiasm in the patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy. The tremendous achievements of the Chinese people have infinitely inspired the Korean people, who, in a difficult war environment, are devoting all their strength to opposing the American imperialist aggression, and have further strengthened the Korean people's confidence in victory.

The heroic struggle and brilliant achievements of the Chinese and Korean peoples are closely related to the interests of peace-loving people all over the world. Therefore, the world peace and democracy camp, headed by the great Soviet Union, and progressive humanity are actively supporting the Chinese and Korean peoples.

Dear comrades!

The Chinese People's Volunteers, armed with lofty proletarian internationalism and Mao Zedong Thought, treat the Korean people as their own brothers, cherishing the rivers and mountains of Korea as they cherish the land of their own motherland. They will never allow the enemy to seize an inch of Korean territory, and they fight selflessly for justice and peace, and are invincible.

They are not only brave and skilled in battle, but also save others at the risk of their own lives in the hail of bullets of the enemy, and help the families of soldiers and martyrs who lack labor in agricultural production as if it were their own business. They also save their own rations to help the suffering farmers and the general population.

Therefore, the Korean people regard the Chinese People's Volunteers as their own sons and daughters, their own brothers.

Bai Zheng-nyeo, a Korean woman who sent her son to the Korean People's Army, sincerely made several sets of underwear and sent them to the Volunteers, and wrote a letter saying: I really wanted to make something delicious to celebrate my son's birthday, and in the same way, I would like to celebrate your victory in place of your distant mothers. … I believe that the person who receives this letter will definitely avenge this old mother, and will bravely annihilate the enemy together with my son…. This is the common feeling and expectation of all the Korean people towards the Chinese People's Volunteers.

This flesh-and-blood friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples has been further consolidated in the flames of annihilating the American aggressors. The Korean people believe that it is an infinite honor and something to be proud of to have such true comrades-in-arms.

The brilliant achievements made by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fighting shoulder to shoulder will forever shine in the history of Korea, and the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples cannot be destroyed by any force.

In contrast, after the American imperialist group's aggressive plans were thwarted by the power of the Chinese and Korean peoples, the contradictions within them have increased day by day, and the dark future of the warmongers has further promoted the overall crisis of the imperialist camp.

Although the American imperialists have continued to suffer shameful defeats in the face of the powerful and just force of the Chinese and Korean peoples, they are unwilling to accept this lesson and are still delaying the armistice negotiations, trying every possible means to expand the war.

However, no attempt or power of the American aggressors can defeat the firm will of the Chinese and Korean peoples. The Chinese and Korean peoples will surely smash the American aggressors' conspiracy to undermine the negotiations, and fight to the end to achieve an armistice in Korea on a fair and reasonable basis, to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea, and to enable the Korean people to peacefully resolve the Korean issue themselves.

Dear comrades!

The Korean people must further consolidate the comradely unity with the Chinese people forged in blood, and in order to win the final victory, unite firmly around their beloved leader General Kim Il-sung, overcome all difficulties, and persevere in the heroic struggle with the determination to shed every last drop of blood.

The final victory will surely belong to the side of justice and truth,

It must belong to our side, which is receiving the active support and solidarity of peace-loving people all over the world.

Long live the second anniversary of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war to resist America and aid Korea!

Victory and glory belong to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers!

Long live the heroic Korean People's Army!

Long live the brotherly friendship and unbreakable unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples in the struggle against our common enemy, American imperialism!

Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, who sincerely helps the Korean people's liberation war!

Long live General Kim Il-sung, the beloved leader of the Korean people!

Long live Marshal Stalin, the great teacher of peace-loving people all over the world and the friend of our two peoples!

### 朝鲜驻我国大使权五稷的讲话

专栏：

    朝鲜驻我国大使权五稷的讲话亲爱的诸位！
    今天是朝鲜人民永远不能忘记的英勇的中国人民志愿军出国作战的二周年纪念日。
    朝鲜人民的反对美英武装干涉者的正义斗争曾经历过最艰难的时期，伟大的中国人民高举着抗美援朝保家卫国的旗帜，把自己的优秀儿女派遣到朝鲜前线，直接用鲜血援助了朝鲜人民。
    这一意义重大的两年前的十月二十五日，把朝鲜的反侵略战争扭转了过来，成了确保最后胜利的转折点。
    从那以后，两年的期间，英勇的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军紧密的并肩作战，给自夸为强大的敌人以沉重的打击，把已爬进到清川江以北的敌人，击退到三八线以南，使敌我的战线在三八线附近对峙了起来。
    这样就使朝鲜北半部的人民恢复了民主自由的生活。所以，朝鲜人民热烈祝贺英勇中国人民志愿军的伟大抗美援朝的辉煌胜利。向派遣了自己亲爱的儿女和丈夫到朝鲜前线去的伟大的中国人民，致以感谢和敬意；并向经常地深切关怀抗美援朝的伟大的毛泽东主席，致以衷心的感谢和敬意。
    我代表朝鲜人民的意愿，再一次谨向中国人民的忠实而英勇的儿女中国人民志愿军的彭德怀司令员和伟大的中国人民及其领袖毛泽东主席，致以热诚的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    亲爱的诸位！
    在与美帝国主义侵略者的艰苦的斗争当中，朝中两国人民不但很光荣地保卫了自己祖国的自由独立，也显示了人民民主制度的优越性，更加巩固了人民的政治和思想上的统一，也于维护亚洲及世界和平的事业尽了莫大的贡献。
    伟大的中国人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在大规模的国家建设上争取了辉煌的成就。这
    一国家建设的斗争和抗美援朝运动一起，在全中国的每一个角落，像燎原之火似地广泛展开，中国的劳动人民在爱国增产节约运动中，发挥了无比的爱国热忱。中国人民的这种巨大成就，无限鼓舞了在艰苦的战争环境中、拿出所有的力量反对着美帝国主义侵略的朝鲜人民，也更加强了朝鲜人民的胜利信心。
    朝中两国人民的英勇斗争和辉煌成就，是和全世界爱好和平人民的利益密切相关联着的。所以，以伟大苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营和进步的人类，都在积极支持着朝中两国人民。
    亲爱的诸位！
    以崇高的无产阶级国际主义和毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民志愿军，拿朝鲜人民就当做是亲弟兄，他们爱护朝鲜河山，就像爱护自己祖国的国土
    一样。他们绝不让敌人夺去朝鲜的寸土，他们为了正义与和平，忘我地斗争，所向无敌。
    他们不但英勇善战，而且在敌阵的枪林弹雨中，舍己救人，还帮助了劳动力不够的军、烈属进行农业生产，就当做自己的事情一样；他们又把自己的口粮节省下来，救济了受难的农民和一般人民。
    所以，朝鲜人民把中国人民志愿军看成是自己的儿女、自己的亲弟兄。
    把自己的儿子送到朝鲜人民军的朝鲜妇女白正女，她诚心诚意做了几套内衣，送给志愿军，并写了一封信，她的信里说到：我很想做些好吃的东西来祝贺我儿子的生日，和这一样，我很想代替你们的远离的母亲，我来祝贺你们胜利。……我相信：接到我这封信的人，一定会替这老母亲伸冤报仇，一定会和我的儿子一起，勇敢地把敌人歼灭掉……。这是全体朝鲜人民对于中国人民志愿军所共有的感情和期待。
    朝中两国人民的这种血肉相关的友谊，在击歼美国侵略者的火焰中，更加巩固起来，朝鲜人民以为：能有这样的真正战友是无限光荣的，值得夸耀的。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，所立下的辉煌功绩，将在朝鲜的历史上永远灿烂，朝中两国人民的友谊、团结，是任何的力量所不能摧毁的。
    与此相反，美帝国主义集团的侵略计划，由于朝中人民的威力而遭到破产以后，它们内部的矛盾日益增加，战争挑拨者们的黑暗前途，更加促进了帝国主义阵营的全面的危机。
    美帝国主义者们，虽然在朝中人民的强大的正义的武力面前，继续遭到了可耻的失败，而它不愿接受这一教训，还在拖延停战谈判，千方百计地企图扩大战争。
    可是，美国侵略者的任何企图和力量，也决不能挫败朝中人民的坚强斗志。朝中两国人民，一定会粉碎美国侵略者的破坏谈判的阴谋，为在公平合理的基础上，实现朝鲜停战，为使一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，为使朝鲜人民自己和平解决朝鲜问题而斗争到底。
    亲爱的同志们！
    朝鲜人民要更加巩固用鲜血结成的与中国人民的战友的团结，为了争取最后的胜利，巩固地团结在自己敬爱的领袖金日成将军的周围，克服一切的艰难困苦，以流尽最后一滴血的决心，坚持着英勇的斗争。
    最后的胜利是一定属于正义和真理的这一边的，
    一定是属于受着全世界爱好和平人民的积极支持与声援的我们这一边的。
    英勇的中国人民志愿军抗美援朝参战二周年万岁！
    胜利和光荣属于英勇的中国人民志愿军！
    英雄的朝鲜人民军万岁！
    在反对共同的敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，朝中两国人民的兄弟友谊和牢不可破的团结万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖、诚心援助朝鲜人民解放战争的毛泽东主席万岁！
    朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成将军万岁！
    全世界爱好和平人民的伟大导师、我们两国人民的亲友——斯大林大元帅万岁！
