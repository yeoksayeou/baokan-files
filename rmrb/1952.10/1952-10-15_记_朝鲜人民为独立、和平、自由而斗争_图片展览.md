    A Record of the "Photo Exhibition of the Korean People's Struggle for Independence, Peace, and Freedom"
    Jin Feng
    Amidst towering mountains and turbulent currents, a heroic Korean woman is poling a wooden raft, transporting timber; preparing to rebuild her homeland on the ruins destroyed by the American military. On her face, hardened by the cruel war, we see the Korean people's complete faith and hope for building a peaceful life.
    This is one of the photos in the "Photo Exhibition of the Korean People's Struggle for Independence, Peace, and Freedom." All the photos take us to that heroic country, the place that all humanity is anxiously watching. It shows where the black shadow of war actually comes from, and what the American government, which claims to be "civilized," has actually done in Korea. The contrast between war and peace is so clear here. We first see a series of pictures of the peaceful and happy lives of the people of North Korea who have gained independence and freedom. Farmers are celebrating the victory of land reform, female tractor drivers are joyfully cultivating the land, and lovely Korean mothers are smiling while holding heavy ears of grain. Welcoming peaceful construction, cement factory workers are sending out thousands of tons of cement, and textile workers are working diligently at their looms. Farm women are buying daily necessities at cooperatives, and workers are happily spending their vacations by the sea, with accordions playing lively tunes. New nurseries are being established, and babies are sleeping sweetly in snow-white cribs. Ancient operas are being performed, and farmers are dancing harvest dances in the fields. All this is so much like what is happening on our motherland's soil!
    However, at this very moment, the shadow of war has quietly crept towards the peaceful people. The Wall Street capitalists, who were fattened by the blood of the people in World War II, discovered that the market that had "prospered" because of the war was rapidly shrinking, and industrial production was declining year after year. Thus, we see American Ambassador to South Korea Muccio and his South Korean lackeys plotting the invasion of North Korea in front of a large map: American officers are training South Korean soldiers, and the spearhead of an aggressive military map of "Northern Expedition" points directly to the Yalu River, and Dulles, the representative of the Wall Street bosses, comes to the "38th Parallel." The sinful cannon fire rang out. As a result, American industrial production "increased" due to military orders, and the wallets of Wall Street bosses kept bulging. Their profits in 1951 were thirteen times higher than in 1938. This is the real reason for the Korean War.
    This is a planned and evil murder. Napalm bombs are thrown at churches, hospitals, and schools, bayonets are aimed at unarmed women and children, machine guns mow down prisoners of war, and the American air force spreads plagues and death. This is cruelty and ugliness beyond human imagination, as one of the representatives of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference who came to visit wrote: "The entire country has been destroyed and devastated," which is "much worse than he could have imagined."
    However, peace will surely triumph over war, and freedom will triumph over slavery. For the sake of their free homeland, the sons and daughters of Korea took up their guns. As the flames of war approached the border of New China, the outstanding sons and daughters of China crossed the Yalu River. We see the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers passing through dense forests, wading through icy water, advancing—pursuing the American aggressors. Then the American government was forced to accept the armistice negotiations, and shamelessly delayed and sabotaged the negotiations. American generals brazenly announced the bombing of more peaceful cities. Now, the land of Korea is still burning, and the blood of heroes is still flowing.
    Looking at these facts, people cannot help but worryingly ask: Will the bombs dropped on the Korean people's heads fall on our heads tomorrow? Will those sinful flies and fleas carrying bacteria crawl on our children tomorrow? Are the remnants of German and Japanese fascists not being re-armed by American officers, just like the South Korean reactionaries? Where will they head tomorrow?
    More and more people are breaking free from the fog of deception and deception spread by that small group of warmongers. Today, when mothers in India watch their sleeping babies in their cradles, and British housewives pray for family peace at the dinner table, they will remember: the napalm and germ bombs being dropped in Korea, the burning houses, the female guerrillas with guns, and the avenging mothers. Hundreds of millions of people all over the world understand that their peaceful lives are closely related to the struggle of the heroic Korean people. They care about and fully support the Korean struggle.
    At the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing, representatives from thirty-six countries paid tribute to the heroic Korean people. Representatives of 1.6 billion people unanimously demanded an immediate end to the Korean War and a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. "Long live peace," just like what is written in various languages by hands of different colors in the visitor's book of the exhibition. The determination and strength of 1.6 billion people will allow that Korean woman's house to be built on the ruins, and let the green shade of peace cover the beautiful land of Korea.

    记“朝鲜人民为独立、和平、自由而斗争”图片展览
    金凤
    在崇山间、在激流中，一位英勇的朝鲜妇女正撑着木排，运输着木材；准备着，在被美军破坏的废墟上重建家园。在她的被严酷的战争磨练得十分坚毅的脸上，我们看到了朝鲜人民对于建立和平生活的全部信念和希望。
    这是“朝鲜人民为独立、和平、自由而斗争”图片展览中的一幅。全部图片把我们带到那英雄的国度，那全人类焦灼地注视着的地方。那里显示着：战争的黑色魔影究竟来自何方，自称“文明”的美国政府究竟在朝鲜干了些什么。战争与和平的对比在这里是这样的分明。我们首先看到的是一幅幅获得独立、自由的北朝鲜人民和平、幸福生活的图画。农民们在庆祝着土地改革的胜利，女拖拉机手愉快地耕种着土地，可爱的朝鲜母亲抱着沉甸甸的谷穗微笑。迎接着和平建设，水泥厂的工人送出千百吨水泥，纺织女工在织布机前紧张劳动。农妇们正在合作社选购日用品，工人们愉快地在海边度着假期，手风琴轻快地拉起来。新的托儿所在建立起来，婴儿在雪白的小床上甜睡着。古老的歌剧在上演，农民们在田野里跳着丰收舞。这一切，多么像我们祖国土地上正在发生着的！
    但是，就在这个时候，战争的魔影，已经悄悄地向着和平的人民袭来。在第二次世界大战中用人民的血喂养得更肥的华尔街资本家，发现因大战而
    “繁荣”的市场在迅速萎缩，工业生产量在年年下降。于是，我们看到美国政府驻南朝鲜大使缪锡俄和他的南朝鲜奴才在一张大地图前策划着进攻北朝鲜的阴谋：美国军官在训练着南朝鲜士兵，一张“北伐”军事地图的侵略矛头直指向鸭绿江边，华尔街老板的代表杜勒斯来到“三八”线。罪恶的炮声响了起来。于是，美国的工业生产量因军事定货而
    “上升”，华尔街老板的钱包不断胀起来。他们在一九五一年的利润比一九三八年增加十三倍。这就是朝鲜战争的真正原因。
    这是有计划的罪恶的谋杀。凝固汽油弹投向教堂、医院和学校，枪刺对着手无寸铁的妇女、儿童，机枪扫射着战俘，美国的空军散布着瘟疫和死亡。这是超出人类想像的残酷和丑恶，正如来参观的一位亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表所写的：“整个国家被毁灭和破坏”，这比他“所能想像的更坏得多”。
    但是，和平必将战胜战争，自由将战胜奴役。为了自由的祖国，朝鲜的儿女们拿起了枪。战火迫近新中国边境，优秀的中华儿女跨过鸭绿江。我们看到朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军穿过密林，涉过冰水，前进——追击着美国侵略军。然后是美国政府被迫接受停战谈判，又无耻地拖延破坏谈判。美国将军们悍然宣布轰炸更多的和平城市。现在，朝鲜的土地还在燃烧着，英雄们的鲜血还在流着。
    看看这些事实，人们不得不耽心地问：投在朝鲜人民头上的炸弹，明天会不会落到我们头上来？那罪恶的带着细菌的苍蝇、跳蚤，明天不会爬到我们孩子们身上来吗？德国和日本的法西斯残余势力，不正像南朝鲜的反动派一样在由美国军官重新武装起来吗？他们明天将开向何方？
    愈来愈多的人们，正从那一小撮战争贩子所散布的蒙蔽、欺骗的毒雾中摆脱出来。今天，当印度的母亲注视着摇篮中熟睡的婴儿，英国的家庭主妇在晚餐桌上祈祷着一家平安的时候，她们会想起：正在朝鲜投掷的凝固汽油弹和细菌弹，燃烧的房屋，拿枪的女游击队员和复仇的母亲。全世界成亿万的人们懂得：他们的和平生活和英勇的朝鲜人民的斗争息息相关。他们关怀和全力支持朝鲜斗争。
    在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上，有三十六个国家的代表向英雄的朝鲜人民致敬。十六亿人民的代表一致要求立即停止朝鲜战争，和平解决朝鲜问题。“和平万岁”，正像那展览会的意见簿上，由各色皮肤的手用各国文字所写的。十六亿人民的决心和力量将让那位朝鲜妇女的小屋在废墟上建立起来，让和平的绿荫覆盖着朝鲜美丽的土地。（附图片）
