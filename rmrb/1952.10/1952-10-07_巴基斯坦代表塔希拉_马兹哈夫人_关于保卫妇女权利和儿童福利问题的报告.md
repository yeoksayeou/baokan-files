Mr. Chairman and Friends:

    On behalf of the Pakistan delegation, I would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for the honor our delegation has received to make a report on the protection of women's rights and child welfare. This report concerns the majority of the people in the Asian and Pacific region. Furthermore, its importance lies in the fact that it is more closely related to people who have nothing to do with the manufacture of war, and among these people, a large proportion are merely helpless victims of the most vicious weapons invented by mankind. Today's war is no longer just a matter of concern for the directly participating armies. It is a total war, which may destroy all of humanity and all the achievements of mankind in the field of civilization. Therefore, today's struggle against war must be a collective effort to mobilize the strength and wisdom of peace-loving people from all countries around the world, more so than ever before.

    The impact of war on the lives of women and children is not easy to express in appropriate language. Who with a conscience can see a mother bidding farewell to her son, knowing she will never see him again, without being moved? Who can not feel pain in their soul when they think of the thousands upon thousands of women who have lost their husbands due to the cruel war machines that manufacture death on a massive scale? And how can even the most ruthless and cruel person remain indifferent when seeing innocent babies snatched from their mothers' arms to be used as bayonet practice targets? Who can pretend not to see the problem when thousands upon thousands of children are being killed, slaughtered, or crippled in the wars being waged in Korea, Malaya, and Vietnam, when the world faces the terrible prospect of a conflagration that could engulf the entire globe? Before I go on to discuss other aspects of the issues of war and peace related to the protection of women's rights and child welfare, I would like to first quote a story reported by an American journalist in "Time" magazine. He said that in a town in South Korea, he saw a young boy, one of the millions seeking shelter on the platform of an uncovered train station. When the American journalist spoke to him, he asked what his plans were. The young war orphan replied, "I have no plans, because I will die soon." The American journalist asked him, "Why?" He said, "Because when it was cold last year, my brother died; when it is cold this year, it will be my turn to die." Millions more Korean children, Malayan children, and Vietnamese children could very well and truthfully make such a terrible prophecy about their own fate, because these countries are also being visited by the demons of war that come with every imperialist intervention.

    Friends, if we cannot unite sufficient strength, if we cannot develop and mobilize the people of all countries to join our ranks, if we cannot accomplish the glorious task we have undertaken, then perhaps it is your son, perhaps it is my son, who, when questioned by one of the journalists who follow the pillaging imperialist armies, will utter these chilling words: "When it is cold, it will be my turn to die."

    Besides those countries where the struggle for peace is part of the struggle against foreign aggression, in other countries in Asia, the threat of war and the carrying out of war preparations seriously hinder the progress of women in their struggle for human equality, and hinder the common desire to ensure that our children receive the best upbringing and care.

    I will first talk about my own country, Pakistan. Because firstly, in the short time available, we could not—and we apologize to other Asian countries for this—have sufficient time to study the general situation of other countries, and secondly, in Pakistan, the situation of women's rights and children's well-being is as bad as in any other country.

    The social situation in Pakistan exposes the evils of imperialist plunder. Imperialism has controlled our country for almost two centuries, using Pakistan as a source of raw materials and cheap labor. The new state of Pakistan, established in 1947, has done little to eliminate the damaging effects of decades of long-term enslavement. Pakistani women suffer from a bad system that limits education to a small portion of the population, while a backward economy forces the vast majority of people into unemployment or underemployment, and effective social welfare measures are virtually non-existent. In addition to this, Pakistani women also suffer from various special obstacles. Co-educational education is hindered. Because of even less emphasis on girls' education, it is not surprising that among the ten percent of the literate population in Pakistan, women account for almost less than two percent. In terms of legal and political rights, although some laws have been passed recently to allow women to inherit a portion of their parents' property and other rights, most of these rights have not been realized. There are still some areas in our country where women are actually treated as slaves. In these backward areas, it is very common to sell women or exchange them as commodities, making them live a life no different from the worst form of slavery. With few exceptions, it can be said that women in our country have not yet obtained their legitimate equal status in society, because granting rights on paper is of no use unless, at the same time, social conditions are created that can implement these rights. The average monthly income per person in Pakistan is only about ten rupees or one pound, and women, occupying a low position in the social and economic system of this country, have to bear the brunt of the suffering of poverty. Most of them do not receive adequate medical treatment, and they live in extremely unsanitary environments, easily contracting preventable diseases such as malaria and lung disease. In Pakistan, there is only one qualified doctor for every 30,000 people, and the number of female doctors is far from meeting the needs of our people. This environment forces thousands of Pakistani women into a life of degradation and shame, living a precarious existence by begging or selling their bodies. Although prostitution and begging are prohibited by law, these are just clauses on paper, mocking the suffering of these helpless and defenseless people.

    Pakistani women are beginning to realize that the growing danger of war not only threatens their families and causes them to be scattered, not only presents the possible scenario of their husbands dying and their sons being killed, but also that the current insecure situation, the burden of war preparations, and the semi-colonial nature of our country's economy can hinder our country's progress, and that the struggle for women's rights is inseparable from the future of the country. It is very meaningful that the first group in Pakistan to respond to the call of the Paris Peace Conference was a women's organization—the Punjab Women's Democratic Association. Women oppose war not only because war will inevitably bring them more suffering, but also because when they hear about the unnecessary suffering and disasters suffered by women and children in other parts of the world, their hearts cry out in pain. With the rare exception of someone like Irma Grese, who is a disgrace to women, no woman, whether in Pakistan or elsewhere, can hold back tears when she thinks of a Korean child crying on the chest of his mother who was burned to death by napalm, no woman can turn a blind eye to the insults inflicted on Korean women by foreign troops, and no woman can ignore the fact that in Malaya, headhunters are searching for the heads of young patriots as trophies. Women's honor, proper care for their children, and the heads of their sons—all these are precious to all women. In order to maintain the right to enjoy the benefits of civilized life, to maintain the right to raise their children, to maintain the right to see their children grow up without becoming targets of the terrible tricks of headhunters, Asian women must stand on the same front as the warriors for peace.

    Children are very undervalued in Pakistan, so much so that proper care and welfare for them has become a very important national issue. Economic conditions have reduced the lives of a large proportion of people to the point of starvation, so our children do not get enough food, and the food they do get is not nutritious. The childhood of ordinary children is spent in dirty streets, and when they are able to do some work, they have to help their parents earn a few more coins.

    The infant mortality rate in Pakistan is reportedly as high as 20 percent. There are not enough clinics or hospitals. More than half of the population has never seen a doctor, so disease is constantly increasing in Pakistan.

    Although the demand for education has increased recently, the number of schools is not enough to meet the needs of a population of about 80 million. A serious shortage of teachers, the high cost of books, pens, ink, and other things—all these greatly hinder the universality of education. Pictorial teaching methods are very lacking, and radio and movies have not yet been used as educational tools. Five percent of our children can afford to see a movie occasionally, and what they see are movies about American cowboys and hooligans, so the education they receive does not instill humanistic ideas and promotes the decadent morality of a social system that reverses the standards of human culture.

    The situation is the same in other South Asian countries. The dowry system is very prevalent in many areas, and girls are considered a burden. Education is declining, child welfare is neglected, prostitution and high infant mortality rates are common. In addition, like in Bengal, wartime famines sacrificed 3.5 million lives. In some countries, famines occur due to the oppression of war, and in all famines, women and children always suffer the most. In all these countries, the movement to protect women's rights and child welfare is progressing in various ways, and this movement has become increasingly linked to the peace movement. Taking the work of Indian women as an example, Dougyd Gaul, a 25-year-old housewife, collected 60,000 signatures in the movement to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace treaty.

    Korea has a long history of suffering and misfortune. For a long time, it was under the oppression of Japanese imperialism, and after five years of liberation in northern Korea, the United States, under the shameful cover of the United Nations, carried out interference, destroying Korea's wishes and using all means to enslave this brave nation.

    In the five years after the liberation of northern Korea after the war, the People's Government did a lot of work to improve the lives of women and children by protecting health and popularizing cultural education, and giving them full political, legal, and economic equality. Children's palaces and kindergartens have been established everywhere. There are 218 kindergartens and nurseries in northern Korea. The number of students has doubled compared to when they were just liberated from Japanese oppression, and the number of schools has quadrupled. The infant mortality rate quickly began to decline. The government prohibited the employment of child labor under the age of 14.

    However, just as a new life was beginning, the dark forces of American intervention entered Korea. It was announced that when Hwanghae Province was temporarily occupied by the Americans, 120,000 people were killed or burned alive, most of the victims being defenseless women and children from two or three months to ten years old. Three hundred women and children were concentrated in a stone house and burned to death. In Munji (place name, transliteration), Zhang Yandu (transliteration) was first captured, then raped, and then her five children were killed in front of her. Her youngest daughter, two years old, was trampled to death. There are many more examples of crimes committed under the banner of the United Nations that can be cited. The most inhumane of all the crimes committed by the Americans was launching bacteriological warfare. Cities like Pyongyang were bombed, and large numbers of peaceful residents—men, women, and children—were killed.

    There is no doubt that the Korean people demand peace and freedom from interference. Women all over the world sympathize with their desire to achieve these goals.

    Another country in battle, experiencing the same experiences as Korea, is Vietnam. Due to the six years of crazy violence that France has carried out in Vietnam, which is now supported and assisted by American imperialism, this country has suffered greatly. The French systematically carried out activities of plundering the people's property, destroying crops, and slaughtering livestock, plunging the people into the deepest suffering and causing children to suffer from hunger, cold, and disease. In the Hongkai mining area, a group of workers' children were in class, and the invaders gouged out their eyes and threw some of them into the sea. On June 14, 1948, soldiers of the French Expeditionary Force, while attacking the village of My Trach in Quang Tri Province, captured 100 children and killed them in various unimaginable ways. In central Vietnam, some commanders openly instigated their soldiers to systematically rape women, infecting these women with syphilis. Even 60-year-old women and 10-year-old girls were not spared. The spread of infectious diseases became a disaster for the people.

    In response to all these atrocities, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and people's organizations have, in the past six years, paid special attention to protecting children. Regulations such as prohibiting child labor, subsidizing workers with children under the age of 16, and providing special assistance to orphans caused by the war have been implemented. Collective education for children from the age of eight has been carried out. The terrible impact of the war on Vietnamese women and children is very clear to everyone who understands it. Malaya is a large concentration camp in the UK, where the situation is the same as in Vietnam, where the British also brought death and destruction to many patriotic women and children.

    In this situation, it is no wonder that the Vietnamese people and the Malayan people demand peace, because only in a peaceful environment can they develop their countries and take all measures to protect and promote the welfare of women and children.

    The situation in Japan is the most contradictory. On the surface, the old Japanese Empire was a strong and prosperous country, and even today under foreign occupation, Japanese industry and trade are still developing. However, looking only at the surface can be deceiving. In the past, Japan was under the rule of the most reactionary militarism, and now it is even more burdened with a foreign occupation. The recently signed enslaving so-called peace treaty in San Francisco, which I am ashamed to admit that the Pakistani government also signed, further increases the danger of militarism reviving. This "peace" treaty deceives the Japanese people into believing that they have achieved independence, while at the same time this "peace" treaty continues the old social order, consolidates the position of American capital in Japan, and prepares to turn Japan into a huge military base for aggression against China, Southeast Asia, and Australia.

    In this situation, anyone can imagine the difficult situation of the Japanese people, especially women and children. In the 14 years of aggressive war launched in Japan, these helpless children paid a heavy price. Almost all Japanese children were born and raised during the war. During World War II, many children were killed and became disabled. In addition, many children who lost their parents were abandoned on the streets. The Japanese people still cannot forget the terrible massacres suffered by hundreds of thousands of their compatriots, who died painfully under the first atomic bombs dropped on the two cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

    A report from the International Conference on Child Welfare said: "Living in such a state of poverty, too poor to even raise their children, Japanese mothers are very afraid of having more children. In addition, Japanese newspapers publish various reports almost every day, talking about abandoned children, talking about how parents commit suicide and go to their deaths with their children. Not only that, in Japan, children are also bought and sold like commodities. It is said that in the past year alone, more than 300,000 children were sold."

    In addition, child laborers, war orphans, and other children cannot even receive elementary school education. During the harvest season, 80 percent of schoolchildren cannot attend school because they must participate in work.

    Also, the welfare of mothers and children is neglected because the government allocates too little funding. Sixty percent of Japan's budget this year is for war preparations, and the Japanese people are protesting this situation. The Japan Teachers and Staff Union, an organization of more than 500,000 teachers, is fighting against the revival of militaristic education and demanding the implementation of compulsory education at the expense of the state.

    What the Japanese people urgently need is peace. They keenly feel this need. They want to do everything possible to stop the American invaders from using the Japanese people as cannon fodder, and instead of using the budget for war preparations, they want to use it for peaceful construction work.

    This report on the situation in South Asian countries is gloomy, but our mood is much lighter when we talk about the great progress in the Soviet Union and the great progress China has made after being liberated from the shackles of the US State Department and its agents. Here, women have gained full equality, and the male dominance of many centuries has been eradicated. Feelings of fear and unease have been driven away, and Soviet women and Chinese women are contributing all their strength alongside men in building their countries and creating a new life. The commemorative ceremony of China's National Day convinces us that China is moving forward, and Chinese women have fully participated in all aspects of political, economic, and social life.

    No language can describe the suffering that war has brought to Chinese mothers and children. During the long eight years of the war against Japanese aggression, women and children suffered the most.

    The first thing the new China brought to mothers and children was peace, and peace is the most important aspect of women's lives. Various new reforms have improved people's living standards, and women have become completely equal to men in all aspects. The rights of women and children are guaranteed, and they are now protected by the state. Eighty-five percent of rural areas in China have their own health stations, midwives are scientifically trained, and for all these reasons, the infant mortality rate has been greatly reduced. The number of children currently in school has increased to 56 percent, which is the highest figure in Chinese history. Free education is widely provided in cities and rural areas, and new methods have been used to cultivate children's moral education.

    The most important law on women enacted by the Chinese People's Government is the "Marriage Law." This law for the first time gives women equal rights with men. Abolish the feudal marriage system of arranged marriage, male superiority, and disregard for the interests of children. Implement a new democratic marriage system of freedom of marriage for men and women, monogamy, equality between men and women, and protection of the legitimate interests of women and children.

    I think this one provision is enough to prove to us that Chinese women have finally gained freedom and equality.

    Chinese women are playing an active role in national government agencies, and many women have held important positions in governments at all levels.

    More than 340 million people have signed a declaration calling on the five major powers to conclude a peace treaty and voted against rearming Japan.

    In the Soviet Union, women have been given the same pay for the same work as men. Soviet women have become skilled workers, technicians, engineers, workshop directors, and factory directors and deputy factory directors in enterprises.

    Soviet women are also actively involved in agricultural production. In the post-war period, they have made great achievements in increasing crop yields, developing animal husbandry, and realizing Stalin's plan to transform nature.

    Soviet women also play an important role in national education and public health. More than a million female teachers are educating the thriving new generation. More than a million women work in the public health system. Before the revolution, Russia had only 2,000 female doctors, but today in the Soviet Union, there are 207,000 female doctors. In Uzbekistan alone, there are 550 hospitals and clinics.

    Soviet women widely participate in the administrative work of the state. Two hundred and ninety women have become representatives of the Supreme Soviet. Two thousand two hundred and nine women have been elected as representatives of autonomous republics, and more than 500,000 women have been elected as representatives of local Soviets. Women account for more than 40 percent of the people's judges and people's jurors. In various republics, many women have served as ministers and deputy ministers.

    In the Soviet Union, many systems have been established regarding women's labor and the protection of motherhood and children. Working women receive salaries as usual during pregnancy and childbirth.

    In 1951, the government allocated 6 billion rubles as subsidies for families with large populations or mothers without support.

    In the Soviet Union, ordinary and increasingly numerous free maternity hospitals and gynecological and pediatric clinics have been established. Countless nurseries and kindergartens serve mothers and their children.

    Regarding the lives of Soviet children, I don't need to say much. There is a saying that the only privileged class that exists in the Soviet Union today, and is entirely created by Soviet society, is children; they enjoy the best that the world can provide, they receive free compulsory education, and each of them has an equal opportunity to grow and develop. All the conditions that may be required for the healthy physical and mental development of all children, the next generation of the Soviet people, have been met.

    In short, we can only agree with the demands made by the International Conference on Child Welfare held in Vienna this April. The facts are undeniable, and this fact is increasingly deeply felt by the women's movements in every Asian country: that the prerequisite for protecting women's rights and child welfare is to establish lasting peace. Therefore, the common task of women around the world is to put the struggle against war first. Many new acts of terror have been created on the soil of Asia under the command of American generals whose concept of defense leads them to send troops to foreign territories thousands of miles away from the United States. They want to use bacteriological warfare and napalm bombs to defend democracy, and if that is not enough, they threaten humanity with atomic war. The peace-loving American people, whose representatives (including women) have also attended this conference, let us resolutely resist the expansionist activities of American imperialism and its accomplices. We must oppose the establishment of military bases in our country, we must oppose sending our sons and brothers out as cheap cannon fodder, we must oppose the attempts of war profiteers to divide humanity, and we must unite and move forward with determination to strive for peace and defend peace. In this noble cause, Asian women will stand at the forefront, because they benefit the most from peace and lose the most in war.

    Call

    Good men and women!

    Let us concentrate our efforts and unite to defend the right to life of all children in the world, to guarantee health, and the right to develop moral and intellectual education.

    We want governments to guarantee these rights: Laws protecting children should be passed everywhere, and existing laws should be implemented.

    Let us demand that important parts of the budget be put forward to meet social and cultural needs, used to protect mothers and children, and not to expand armaments.

    Let us openly oppose and condemn acts of inciting racial discrimination, violence, and war in schools, in certain children's publications, and in film and radio programs.

    To protect our children, let us use all our strength to rebuild and consolidate peace among the peoples of all countries.

    Let us take action to urge our governments to end the wars that are slaughtering the children of Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya.

    Let us take action to the United Nations Disarmament Committee, to eliminate the heavy burden of military budgets for the welfare of children.

    Let us demand that the cruel crime of mass slaughter of children by using atomic, chemical, and bacteriological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction of human life be condemned and prohibited.

    We demand that all countries ratify the Geneva Protocol signed in 1925, which declares bacteriological weapons illegal.

    Let us declare to the world that the colonial peoples have the right to liberate themselves from oppression, which has made them unable to breathe, and has caused their children to suffer sacrifices.

    People of the world, let us strengthen the bonds of fraternal cooperation! For the sake of saving children! Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates:

    Before I take my seat, I want to pay tribute to some important leaders of international women's movements. These women, because of their talents, courage, and loyalty to the cause of social justice and peace, have won the heartfelt love of women all over the world and have become models for the millions of women who are engaged in the struggle to pursue truth, to uphold human dignity, and to save mankind from war.

    First of all, Madame Soong Ching Ling, the leader of the new women of China, who has struggled for many years to liberate her Chinese sisters; she has played a brilliant role in realizing the new China that her noble husband, the great Chinese revolutionary Dr. Sun Yat-sen, idealized; she is continuing to fight today to liberate women from the chains of the past.

    Madame Eugénie Cotton, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, is a brave warrior for the cause of peace and women's liberation. Hidden behind her gentle demeanor is an indomitable, steel-like will.

    There is also the Soviet Union's Kosmodemyanskaya, who dedicated the great Zoya to her motherland. After losing her two children in the world war, she became even stronger and fought to ensure that children around the world have the right to grow up. Kosmodemyanskaya is not only a school teacher of the great Soviet Union—she is also a teacher of all women in the world.

    I would also like to mention Anna Seghers, the great German novelist, and Pak Chong-ae, the flower of Korean women. Their countries have been divided by imperialists, one suffering from the flames of war and the other threatened by war. These women are fighting for national unity, national freedom, and the autonomy of their people.

    The record of women's service to humanity would not be complete without mentioning Mrs. Felton of the United Kingdom. Mrs. Felton's work for the cause of peace will write a glorious page in British history. Mrs. Bass of the United States is worthy of respect because she expresses all the best things in this great land, which is now in the hands of neo-fascists. Mrs. Felton, Mrs. Bass, your tears are washing away some of the blood debts owed by the American and British armies and their allies in Korea, Malaya, and Vietnam. Your work will lead to a world without bloodshed. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 巴基斯坦代表塔希拉·马兹哈夫人  关于保卫妇女权利和儿童福利问题的报告

1952-10-07
第5版()
专栏：

    巴基斯坦代表塔希拉·马兹哈夫人
    关于保卫妇女权利和儿童福利问题的报告主席先生和朋友们：
    我谨代表巴基斯坦代表团，对于我们的代表团得到作关于保卫妇女权利和儿童福利问题的报告的光荣，表示我们衷心的谢意。这个报告关系到亚洲及太平洋区域大多数的人民。此外，它的重要性还在于它更密切地关系到与制造战争没有任何关系的人们，而在这些人们之中，有一大部分仅仅是人类所发明的最恶毒的武器的无助的受害者。今日的战争已经不再是仅仅和直接参战的军队发生关系的事情了。它是一个总体战，可能毁灭全部人类和人类在文明的领域所有的一切成就，因此今日反对战争的斗争，比起从前来必须更加是一个需要动员全世界各国爱好和平的人民的力量与智慧的全体的努力。
    妇女和儿童的生活受到战争的影响，是不容易用恰当的语言表达出来的。凡是有良心的人，谁能看到一个母亲向自己知道将永不能再看见的儿子道别时而不受到感动呢？当想到成千成万的妇女由于大规模制造死亡的残酷的战争机器而失去了丈夫时，谁的灵魂能不感到痛苦呢？而且当看到无辜的婴儿们从他们的母亲怀里被夺过去当作劈刺练习的目标时，即使是最无情、最残忍的人，又怎能无动于衷呢？当成千成万的儿童由于在朝鲜、马来亚和越南所进行的战争而正在被杀戮、被宰割或变成残废时，当世界面临着可怕的并且可能燃遍全世界的战火的景象时，谁能装着看不见这个问题呢？在我没有往下谈到有关保卫妇女权利和儿童福利的战争与和平问题的其他方面以前，我愿意先引一个美国记者在“时代”周刊上所报道的一个故事。他说他在南朝鲜的一个城镇里看到一个年轻的男孩，他是在一个没有遮掩的火车站的月台上寻求栖身之所的千万人中的一个。那个美国记者在和他谈话时，问到他的计划是什么。这个年轻的战争孤儿回答说：“我没有计划，因为不久我就要死了。”那个美国记者问他：“为什么？”他说：“因为去年天冷时，我的哥哥死了；今年天冷时，就该我死了。”千万的更多的朝鲜儿童、马来亚儿童和越南儿童，可以很好地并很真实地做出这样的关于他们自己命运的可怕预言，因为这些国家也为随着每一次帝国主义的干涉而来的战争魔鬼所光顾了。
    朋友们，假如我们不能团结起足够的力量，假如我们不能发展并动员世界各国人民来参加我们的行列，假如我们不能完成我们自己已经担当起来的光荣任务，那么也许是你的儿子，也许是我的儿子，当受到跟随着劫掠的帝国主义军队而来的记者群中的一个人的询问时，他会说出这令人心寒的几个字来：“当天冷的时候，就该我死了。”
    除了那些争取和平的斗争就是反对外国侵略的斗争的一部分的国家之外，在亚洲其他各国中，战争的威胁与进行备战，严重地阻碍着妇女们争取人类平等的权利的斗争的进展，阻碍着要使我们的儿童得到最好的抚养与照顾的普通愿望。
    我先讲一讲自己的国家巴基斯坦。因为首先，在短促的时间中，我们不可能——这一点我们向其他亚洲国家道歉——有充分的时间去研究其他国家的一般情况，其次，在巴基斯坦，妇女权利与儿童幸福的情况像任何其他国家的情况一样恶劣。
    巴基斯坦的社会情况，暴露了帝国主义的罪恶掠夺。帝国主义掌握我们的国家差不多已有两世纪之久，利用巴基斯坦作为供给原料与贱价劳动力的来源。一九四七年建立的巴基斯坦新国家，在消除数十年长期奴役的损害性的影响方面，做得很少。巴基斯坦妇女受到不良制度的害处，这种制度使教育只限于人口中的一小部分人，而落后的经济迫使广大的人民陷于失业或半失业，同时社会福利的有效措施实际上是不存在的。除此之外，巴基斯坦的妇女们还受到各种特殊的障碍。男女同校的教育受到阻难。由于对女子教育更不重视，因此毫不足怪，在巴基斯坦百分之十的识字人口中，妇女差不多连百分之二也不到。在法律和政治权利方面，虽然最近曾通过一些法律，使妇女可以分得她们父母的财产及其他权利的一部分，但这些权利大部分都没有实现。我国仍有某些地区，那里的妇女实际上是被当作奴隶看待，在这些落后的地区里，很普遍地在贩卖妇女或把妇女作为商品交换，使他们过着与最坏的奴隶制度无异的生活，除了少数例外，可以说我国妇女还未能在社会中得到他们的合法的平等地位，因为赋予一纸空文的权利是无济于事的，除非跟这同时，创造出能够实行这些权利的社会条件。巴基斯坦每人每月平均收入只有约十个卢比或者一英镑，而妇女又在这个国家的社会、经济制度中处于卑下的地位，她们就不得不首当其冲地担受贫困折磨的重担。她们大多数都得不到适当的医药治疗，并且她们都在极不卫生的环境里生活着，很容易患一些本来可以预防的疾病，如疟疾及肺病。在巴基斯坦，三万个人中间只有一个合格的医生，而女医生的数目，比起我们人民的需要来却相差得更远。这种环境，迫使成千的巴基斯坦妇女沦入堕落和耻辱的生活中去，以行乞或出卖肉体来苟延残喘地生活着；法律上虽然禁止卖淫和行乞，但是这都是纸上的条文，是对于这些无援无助的人们的苦难遭遇的嘲笑。
    巴基斯坦的妇女们开始认识到：日益增长的战争危险，不只是威胁着她们的家庭而使之分散，不只是显示出她们夫死子亡的可能情景，而且，目前的不安全的局面、备战的负担以及我国经济的半殖民地性，都能够阻止我们国家前进，而争取妇女权利的斗争与国家的前途是分不开的。巴基斯坦最先响应巴黎和平会议的号召的就是一个妇女团体——旁遮普妇女民主协会，这是很有意义的。妇女们反对战争，不仅因为战争一定会带给她们更多的痛苦，而且也因为，当她们听到在全世界其他部分妇女与儿童遭受到的不必要的痛苦与灾难的时候，她们的内心就会因为悲痛而呼号。除了丢女性的脸的保爱尔萨·科赫这样稀有的例子以外，没有一个妇女，无论在巴基斯坦或在其他的地方，当她想到一个朝鲜的儿童伏在他那被凝固汽油弹烧死的母亲的胸前痛哭的时候，会忍住不流泪的，没有一个妇女对于外国军队加予朝鲜妇女的侮辱的行为能够熟视无睹的，没有一个妇女能够漠视：在马来亚，那些猎取人头的人们在搜索着年青的爱国志士的头颅当做胜利品。妇女们的荣誉，对她们的孩子的适当的照顾，她们儿子的头颅，这一切对于所有妇女都是宝贵的。为着保持享有文明生活的好处的权利，为着保持抚养她们的孩子的权利，为着保持亲眼看到她们的孩子长大成人而不致变成猎取人头者的恐怖伎俩的目标的权利，亚洲的妇女必须和争取和平的战士站在同一条战线上。
    儿童们在巴基斯坦是很不被重视的，以致对他们的正当的照顾和福利已成了一个非常重要的全国性问题了。经济条件使很大部分人的生活降低到挨饿的程度，因此我们的儿童们得不到足够的食物，而能够得到的一些食物又都是缺乏营养的。一般儿童的幼年生活都是在肮脏的街道中度过的，当他们能够做一些工作的时候，他们就得帮助父母多挣几个钱。
    巴基斯坦的婴孩死亡率根据报道已高到了百分之二十。没有足够的诊所或医院。人口中的一半以上从来没有看过医生，因此巴基斯坦的疾病是在不断地增加着。
    虽然对教育的要求最近是增加了，可是学校的数目是不够应付八千万左右的人口的。严重的师资的缺乏，书籍、钢笔与墨水、以及别的东西的昂贵，这些都大大地阻碍了教育的普遍。形象化的教育方法很缺乏，无线电和电影至今还没有被用作教育的工具。我们的儿童中有百分之五是偶而看得起一次电影的，他们所看到的是关于美国牧人和流氓的片子，所以他们所得到的教育，就是灌输的不是人道思想和宣扬颠倒人类文化标准社会制度中的颓废道德。
    在其他南亚洲各国中，情况是相同的。妆奁制度在许多地区都很盛行，女孩子被认为是一种负担。教育衰废，儿童幸福被忽视，娼妓制度与婴孩大量死亡是普遍的现象。此外，就像在孟加拉省那样，战时的灾荒牺牲了三百五十万人的生命，在有些国家里，由于战争的压榨，灾荒一度发生，而在一切灾荒中，受难最重的总是妇女与儿童。在所有这些国家里，保卫妇女权利与儿童幸福的运动，正以各种方式在进行着，这种运动已日益与和平运动连系在一起了。以印度妇女的工作为例，窦吉德·高尔，一位二十五岁的家庭妇女，在要求五大国缔结和平公约的运动中就曾征集了六万个签名。
    朝鲜有很长久的苦难和不幸的历史。在很长的时期中它是处在日本帝国主义的压迫之下，而在朝鲜北部获得解放五年以后，美国却在联合国可耻的掩护下进行了干涉，破坏了朝鲜的愿望，并且使用了一切手段来奴役这个勇敢的民族。
    在战后朝鲜北部获得解放的五年中，人民政府做了许多工作，用保护健康与普及文化教育的方法来改进妇女和儿童的生活状况，并给予他们充分的政治上、法律上和经济上的平等。到处都设立了儿童宫和幼儿园。朝鲜北部有二百一十八个幼儿园和托儿所。学生的数目比他们刚刚从日本压迫下解放出来的时候增加了两倍，学校的数目增加了四倍。婴儿的死亡率很快地就开始减低了。政府禁止雇用十四岁以下的童工。
    可是，新的生活刚刚开始，美国干涉的黑暗势力进入了朝鲜。据宣布在黄海道暂时被美国人占领的时候，就有十二万人民被杀死或活活烧死，大部分的牺牲者都是无力的妇女和从两三个月到十岁的儿童。三百个妇女和儿童被集中在一幢石头房子里，把她们全部烧死。在文济（地名，译音）张延度
    （译音）先被抓住，然后被强奸，接着，她的五个孩子也在她的面前被杀死。她的最小的一个两岁的女儿被踩死了。在联合国旗帜下所犯的罪行，还有很多的例子可以举出来。美国人所犯的一切罪行中最惨无人道的是发动细菌战。像平壤那样的城市都受到了轰炸，大量的和平居民——男子、妇女和儿童都被杀害。
    毫无疑问，朝鲜人民要求和平，要求不受干涉的自由。全世界的妇女们是同情他们要求达到这些的目的愿望的。
    另一个战斗中的国家，经历着和朝鲜相同的经验，那就是越南。由于法国在越南已经进行了六年的疯狂暴行，现在这又得到美帝国主义的支持和帮助，这个国家遭受了极大的痛苦。法国人有系统地进行了掠夺人民的财物、毁坏庄稼、屠杀牲畜的活动，使人民陷入最深的苦难中，使儿童遭受饥寒和疾病。在红开矿区，有一群工人子弟在上课，侵略者把他们的眼睛挖出来，更把他们之中的一些人抛到海里去。一九四八年六月十四日，法国远征队的兵士在袭击广治省美泽村时，抓住了一百个小孩，用各种难以设想的方法把他们杀死。在越南中部，有些司令官公开地唆使他们的兵士有组织地强奸妇女，使这些妇女传染上梅毒。甚至六十岁的老妇和十岁的女孩也不能例外。传染病的散布成了人民的灾祸。
    针对所有这些暴行，越南民主共和国政府和人民团体在过去六年中，特别关心保卫儿童的问题。禁止童工，津贴子女在十六岁以下的工人，特别资助战争造成的孤儿等，种种规定都已经实行了。从八岁起的儿童集体教育已经举办了。战争对越南妇女和儿童的可怕的影响，是每个明白人都知道得十分清楚的。马来亚是英国的大集中营，这里的情况和越南一样，在这里，英国人也把死亡和毁灭带给了许多爱国妇女和儿童。
    在这种情形下，无怪乎越南人民和马来亚人民都要求和平，因为只有在和平的环境中，他们才能发展他们的国家，才能采取一切措施来保护和促进妇女和儿童的福利。
    日本的情况是最矛盾的。从表面上看来，旧的日本帝国是一个强大和繁荣的国家，甚至今天在外国占领下，日本的工业和贸易仍在发展中。但是，光看外表是会受骗的。在从前，日本是处在最反动的军国主义的统治之下，而现在更加上了一个外国的占领。最近在旧金山签订的奴役性的所谓的和约，我惭愧地承认巴基斯坦政府也在它上面签字，更增加了军国主义复活的危险。这个“和”约欺骗了日本人民，使他们相信他们已经取得了独立，同时这个“和”约也使旧的社会秩序延续下去，巩固了美国资本在日本的地位，并且准备把日本变成一个侵略中国、东南亚及澳洲各国的巨大军事基地。
    在这种情况之下，任何人都可以想像到日本人民，特别是妇女和儿童们的困难的处境。在日本所掀起的十四年的侵略战争中，这些无助的儿童付出了重大的代价。几乎所有的日本儿童都是在战争中出生和长大起来的。在第二次世界大战当中，许多儿童被杀害和变成残废了。此外，许多失去了父母的儿童被抛弃在街头、日本人民还是不能忘怀他们好几十万的同胞们所遭受的可怖的大规模屠杀，他们在投在广岛和长崎两个城市的第一批原子弹之下痛苦地死亡了。
    国际保卫儿童会议上的一个报告中说：“处在这样一个贫困的境地，穷到甚至无力抚养他们的孩子，日本的母亲们非常害怕再多生孩子。此外，日本的报纸差不多每天都登载各种报道，讲道被抛弃的儿童，讲到父母们如何以自杀来和他们的孩子一同走上死路。还不止如此，在日本，儿童也像商品一样，被拿去做买卖。据称只去年一年，有三十万以上的儿童被贩卖了。
    此外，童工和战争孤儿以及其他的儿童，甚至也都不能受到小学教育。在收成的季节里，百分之八十的学童不能上学校，因为他们必须参加工作。
    还有，对母亲和儿童的福利，因为政府拨款太少而被忽略了。日本本年度的预算中百分之六十是在为备战用的，日本人民正在抗议这种情况。日本教职员工会，一个有五十万以上的教师的组织，正在进行斗争，反对军国主义教育的复活，要求实行由国家负担全部费用的义务教育。
    日本人民迫切需要的是和平。他们殷切地感觉到这个需要，他们要尽力制止美国侵略者拿日本人民去当炮灰，而且，不把预算用在备战上，而要用在和平的建设工作上去。
    这个关于南部亚洲各国的情况报告是阴暗的，但是当我们谈到苏联方面巨大的进步、以及中国从美国国务院和它的代理人的枷锁中解放出来以后所取得的巨大的进步的时候，我们的心境就轻快多了。在这里，妇女已经获得了完全平等，许多世纪以来的男子统制权已经被铲除了。恐惧和不安的感觉已经被驱除，苏联的妇女和中国的妇女正和男子并肩地贡献出一切力量在建设他们的国家和创造一种新的生活。中国国庆日的纪念仪式使我们相信中国正在前进，中国妇女已充分参加政治的、经济的和社会的各方面生活。
    没有语言能够描绘出战争带给中国母亲和儿童的痛苦。在反对日本侵略的漫长的八年的岁月里，受害的大多是妇女和儿童。
    新中国首先给母亲和儿童带来了和平，而和平是妇女生活中最重要的一面。种种新的改革提高了人们的生活水准、妇女在各方面已经完全和男子平等。妇女与儿童的权利得到保障，他们现在受到国家的保护。中国百分之八十五的农村都有了他们自己的卫生站，产婆都受到科学的训练，由于这一切原因，婴儿的死亡率大大地减低了。目前在学儿童的数目已增加到百分之五十六，这是中国历史上最高的数字。在城市与农村里普遍地举办了免费教育，他们已经使用新的方法来培养儿童的德育。
    中国人民政府所订的最重要的关于妇女的法律是
    “婚姻法”。这个法律第一次给予妇女与男子平等的权利。废除包办强迫、男尊女卑、漠视子女利益的封建主义婚姻制度。实行男女婚姻自由、一夫一妻、男女权利平等、保护妇女和子女合法利益的新民主主义婚姻制度。
    我认为这一条便足以向我们证明中国妇女终于得到了自由和平等了。
    中国妇女在国家政府机关中正起着积极的作用，很多妇女已在各级政府中担任着重要的职务。
    三亿四千万以上的人民已在要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言书上签了名并投票反对重新武装日本。
    在苏联妇女已得到和男子同工同酬的待遇。苏联妇女当了熟练工人、技师、工程师、车间主任、企业中的厂长和副厂长。
    苏联妇女也积极地参加农业生产。在战后，她们在提高农作物产量方面，在发展牧畜业和实现斯大林改造自然的计划方面，都取得了巨大的成就。
    苏联妇女在国民教育与公共卫生方面也起着重要的作用。百万以上的女教师正教育着蓬勃成长的新的一代。百万以上的妇女在公共卫生系统中工作。革命前的俄国，只有二千名女医师，可是今天在苏联，已有二十万七千名女医师。单是在乌兹别克斯坦，就有五百五十所医院和诊疗所。
    苏联妇女广泛地参加了国家的行政工作。二百九十位妇女已当了最高苏维埃的代表。二千二百零九个妇女被选为自治共和国的代表，五十万以上的妇女被选为地方苏维埃的代表。妇女在人民法官和人民陪审员中占百分之四十以上。在各个共和国里，有许多女子都当了部长、副部长。
    在苏联，关于妇女劳动以及保护母性和儿童，都规定了许多制度。劳动妇女在怀孕和分娩期间都照样领取薪金。
    一九五一年间，政府拨发了六十亿卢布的款项作为给家庭人口众多或没有依靠的母亲们的津贴。
    在苏联，已经建立了普通的而且为数日益增多的免费的产科医院以及妇科和儿科的诊所。无数的托儿所和幼儿园在为母亲和她们的孩子们服务。
    关于苏联儿童们的生活，我用不着说了，人们有这么一种说法：现在在苏联唯一存在的特权阶级、而且是完全由苏维埃社会所产生的特权阶级，就是儿童；他们享有世界上所能得到的最好的东西，他们所受的教育是免费的义务教育，他们每一个人都有成长与发展的平等机会。一切儿童们身心的健康发育所可能需要的一切条件，苏维埃人民的下一代都已经具备了。
    总而言之，我们只有赞成今年四月在维也纳举行的国际保卫儿童大会所提出的要求。事实已经不容争辩，而这一事实，也为每一个亚洲国家的妇女运动越来越深刻地感觉到：那就是保卫妇女权利和保卫儿童福利的先决条件，是建立持久的和平。因此，全世界妇女共同的任务，就是要把反对战争的斗争放在第一位。在美国将军指挥之下，许多新的恐怖事件已在亚洲的土地上制造出来，这些美国将军们的国防观念使他们率领军队到远离美国几千里路以外的外国领土上去。他们要用细菌战和凝固汽油弹来保卫民主，假如这还不够的话，就再用原子战来威胁人类。爱好和平的美国人民，他们的代表们（包括妇女在内）也莅临这次会议，让我们一起坚决反抗美国帝国主义和它同伙们的扩张活动。我们要反对在我们国土上建立军事基地，我们要反对把我们的儿子和兄弟们送出去做廉价的炮灰，我们要反对战争贩子们分裂人类的企图，我们要团结起来，意志坚定地前进，争取和平，保卫和平。在这个崇高的事业中，亚洲的妇女将站在最前列，因为她们在和平中得益最多，在战争中损失最大。
    号召
    善良的男女们！
    让我们集中全力团结起来保卫世界上一切儿童的生活权利，保障健康以及发展德育和知育的权利。
    我们要各国政府保证这些权利：每一个地方都应通过保卫儿童的法律，现有的法律应付诸实施。
    让我们要求从预算中提出重要部分来满足社会与文化的需要，用来保卫母亲与儿童，而不用来扩充军备。
    让我们公开地反对并谴责在学校中、在某些儿童出版物中、在电影和无线电节目中、煽动种族歧视、暴力和战争的行为。
    为了保卫我们的孩子，让我们用一切力量重建并巩固各国人民间的和平。
    让我们行动起来，促使我们的政府结束屠杀朝鲜、越南和马来亚儿童们的那些战争。
    让我们向联合国裁军委员会采取行动，为了儿童们的福利，取消军事预算的沉重负担。
    让我们要求斥责和禁止使用原子、化学和细菌等大规模毁灭人类生命的武器来大批屠杀儿童的残酷罪行。
    我们要求所有的国家批准一九二五年签订的，宣布细菌武器为非法的日内瓦议定书。
    让我们向世界宣告，殖民地人民是有权利把自己从压迫之下解放出来的，这种压迫已在使他们无法呼吸了，已经使他们的儿女遭受牺牲。
    全世界的人民，让我们加强兄弟合作的联系吧！为了拯救儿童！主席先生，各位代表：
    在我就坐以前，我要向一些国际妇女运动重要的领袖们致敬。这些妇女，由于她们的才能，勇敢和对社会正义与和平事业的忠诚，已博得全世界妇女的衷心爱戴，成为正在从事于为追求真理、为维护人类的尊严以及为从战争中拯救人类的斗争的千百万妇女们的榜样。
    首先是中国新妇女的领袖宋庆龄夫人，她多少年为解放她的中国姊妹们而斗争；她在实现她高贵的丈夫，中国伟大的革命家孙中山先生所理想的新中国中起了光辉的作用；她今天正在继续为使妇女从过去的锁链中解放出来而奋斗。
    国际民主妇女联合会主席戈登夫人是和平事业与妇女解放的一位勇敢的战士，她底温文的仪表里却藏着一个坚强不屈的钢铁般的意志。
    还有苏联的柯斯莫捷绵斯卡亚，她把伟大的卓娅献给了她的祖国，她在世界大战中失去了她的两个儿女以后变得更加坚强，为使世界上的儿童有权利长大成人而斗争。柯斯莫捷绵斯卡亚不仅是伟大苏联的一位学校教师——她也是全世界一切妇女的教师。
    我还要提到安娜·西格斯，德国的伟大小说家，和朴正爱，朝鲜妇女的花朵。她们的国家被帝国主义者所分割，一个受到战争的烽火，另一个受到战争的威胁，这些妇女为了国家统一，民族自由，和他们人民的自主权而斗争。
    妇女为人类服务的记载，如果不提到英国的费尔顿夫人，那就不会完全了，费尔顿夫人对和平事业的工作将在英国历史上写下光辉的一页。美国的巴斯夫人是值得尊敬的，因为她表达了一切在这伟大的国土上最美好的东西，现在这块土地却掌握在新法西斯分子的手中。费尔顿夫人，巴斯夫人，你们的眼泪正在洗掉美英军队和他们的同盟军在朝鲜、马来亚和越南所流的一些血债。你们的工作将引向一个不再流血的世界。（新华社）
