    The Economics of Peace
    – Supplementary Report by Indian Delegation Deputy Leader, Gyan Chand, on Economic Exchange
    It is generally accepted that lasting peace cannot be obtained or maintained without a sound economic foundation. Therefore, whether viewed from a domestic or international perspective, it is of utmost importance to correctly handle prominent and pressing economic problems. These should be resolved by countries taking coordinated and consistent measures both domestically and internationally, in a spirit of fairness, while appropriately considering the specific needs of certain countries and the welfare of all nations.

    In the approximately seven years following World War I, until 1925, the world had largely achieved economic recovery. Now, seven years after the end of the war, the world’s economic distress remains extremely severe. This is mainly due to the Korean War, extremely large-scale rearmament, and the unwillingness of certain colonial powers to recognize or satisfy the legitimate national demands of people in many countries.

    It is clearly known that since 1950, the situation has deteriorated significantly. People's living standards have greatly declined. Economic development in most countries has been hindered and obstructed. Especially in Asia and most Pacific region countries, the lack of food, production equipment, and other conditions necessary for economic development has become severe, causing widespread economic hardship. The economies of many countries have reached the brink of collapse, and, worse, reactionary economic and social trends that had been suppressed or even reversed after 1945 have resurfaced. Unless countered, these reactionary trends seem poised to regain dominance, harming the best interests of the people in these countries. The current urgent task is to take international-scale action, not only to alleviate economic tensions, but also to promote collaborative efforts to reverse the situation, and to harness the economic capabilities and resources of the people for peaceful purposes. This includes simultaneously reforming and developing the economies of these countries, alleviating and gradually eliminating hunger, preventing and combating disease, raising the cultural level of the people, and achieving these goals within an organization of universal goodwill and genuine international cooperation.

    These considerations, needless to say, are particularly relevant to the vast majority of countries in this region, which are of greatest concern to this conference. With three or four notable exceptions, the economies of these countries are backward. Their production techniques are antiquated, virtually unchanged, despite the almost unbelievable technological advancements of the past century and a half. Their internal economic relations not only subject the masses to undue and extreme suffering, denying them the basic opportunities for development and fair treatment, but are essentially oppressive. Their ongoing industrialization is not only wholly inadequate but also unbalanced. This industrialization is not planned and implemented primarily with the interests of these countries in mind. In most cases, it places these countries in a position of economic dependence on and subordination to powerful foreign interests.

    These countries are primarily agricultural, but rural economies are not only technologically extremely backward but also support parasitic interest groups. Cultivation units are mostly uneconomical and wasteful. For the vast majority of cultivators, the main source of their economic energy has been exhausted due to years of continuous torment, difficult circumstances, and a continuous and mostly unsuccessful struggle to barely maintain a meager existence.

    The overall consequence of these factors is an unstable and moribund economy, which means extreme poverty and destitution for the masses, concentration of economic power, and control of the most important economic lifelines in these countries by foreign interest groups. These situations are obviously incompatible with the maintenance of lasting peace. To enable these countries to strive for and maintain peace, the first essential condition is, besides achieving independence for countries that are not yet politically independent, that they must obtain complete autonomy in economic decision-making and action, must have unrestricted control over all strategic sectors of their economies, and must be able to resist the pressure of powerful nations. These powerful nations have been and are still using the urgent need for food and other necessities of these countries to force politically independent countries to accept their views and policies.

    These countries need technical and economic assistance, but they have never received assistance under conditions consistent with their true economic freedom. Whenever these countries must choose between economic autonomy and foreign economic assistance, they should unhesitatingly choose economic autonomy for the sake of their best interests. This is a lesson learned from past and present experiences. Any country that ignores this lesson will not only cause serious harm to itself but also prolong the life of the dying imperialist economy. This will severely hinder its own future and the cause of peace. In fact, they must take coordinated action to eliminate the old remnants of their economies, fully control industry, especially basic industries and decisive economic activities.

    Of course, every country can choose its own methods and pace for remedying its economy, but no country in this region can consider itself truly free, nor should it, unless it can steer its economy to meet its own needs. However, this is impossible without realizing true domestic control and abolishing foreign control over economic life in many important aspects.

    The opinion I am now presenting does not contradict the following opinion, which is to say, genuine and truly deserved economic cooperation is needed and should be promoted and realized. Economic aid without any conditions, whether overt or covert, should of course be welcomed – the more the better.

    In this sense, economic autonomy by no means implies economic isolationism or economic stagnation. For these countries, it is extremely important to unfold and maintain a high rate of economic development. At the same time, they must maintain their freedom, seek domestic stability, and satisfy the needs of the rapidly awakening masses. Economic autonomy and self-reliance must go hand in hand. Any country should use its own human resources, and to a large extent its own material resources, to accomplish its own economic liberation.

    These countries have almost unlimited reserves of capacity, social enthusiasm, and potential power to harness, provided they understand the fundamental importance of these forces and take the necessary steps to utilize them. The Chinese people—our admired hosts—have demonstrated on a grand scale in the past three years what we can achieve in this regard, and have also demonstrated that the masses in action can move mountains and overturn seas.

    To repeat, each country should choose its own path, find the secret to entering the treasury full of undiscovered wealth, and thus obtain a life with unlimited development prospects. In Asian countries and most countries in the Pacific region, this work must be carried out immediately, without further delay.

    No matter in what way this work is carried out, it should be adapted to the needs of the masses and give full play to their creativity, eliminate the backward elements in economic life, and correct all kinds of inappropriate measures that have existed in the past. Unless the masses can see that they will have the kind of material life and the complete life realized by the transformation of a new man that is commensurate with their clear destiny, they will not take active action. With this prospect, it is clear that they will be able to raise the spirit of self-restraint necessary for public and private affairs to a very high level.

    Giving technical guidance and training to the masses is of course very important, but this is actually a social investment in human capital, which can be provided once the entire people hear the call of the future to them, and rise up to respond to this call with vigorous confidence. These countries, whether bold or timid, do not trust foreign aid programs, and therefore have to take great political risks, relying on their own individual and, to some extent, collective efforts to achieve economic expansion and development.

    In order for the people to fully play their role, they must jointly participate in the arduous task of forming and developing the economic life of these countries. They should not only be passive tools for implementing the policies stipulated above, but should be active members in formulating and implementing policies; they should have the necessary understanding of their own roles; and they should also be given the opportunity to play their roles. This is true economic democracy and development, as well as training cadres from all levels of the people—especially from the non-privileged classes who have been burdened and silent throughout history. This means acquiring new technologies for managing economic life and abolishing all exclusive economic privileges.

    These considerations are equally valid for India and for the countries in this region, and are raised because they are related to our current economic problems. Now that we have achieved political independence, we must use it to achieve economic autonomy and self-reliance. The difficulties within India have created a situation and material shortages that need to be alleviated as soon as possible.

    There is currently a famine in various parts of India. Although this was initially caused by drought, inflation caused by large-scale rearmament has pushed up food prices, increasing the suffering of the people. The view that India can and should achieve a large degree of self-sufficiency in terms of necessities has been accepted to some extent, but its complexities still need to be clarified so as to serve as the basis for formulating public policy.

    India fully understands the importance of Asian unity as a contribution to the cause of peace, but we must also implement the means of realizing this unity in thought and later in action.

    I hope that this conference can pave the way for a further understanding of these issues and establish an organization to continue studying common problems and exploring ways to solve these problems on an international basis. In this regard, we should take a planned approach to implement policies that will increasingly strengthen the economic unity of the Asian and Pacific region in a spirit of experimentation, guided by experience.

    In terms of trade, the business relationships between these countries in the past were mainly determined by historical factors, which no longer exist or are gradually losing importance. It would naturally be a good thing if intra-regional trade could be developed in this region, but it is clear that the development of such trade will be determined by the degree of economic division of labor or specialization of each country.

    In the past, a very important factor that has restricted the development of trade between countries in this region is that the economies of these countries are basically similar, so the scope for exchanging special products is very narrow. As the rapid industrialization of these countries develops, as it will in fact, the importance of this factor will diminish.

    If more and more consultation methods or other methods are adopted for issues related to common interests, a certain degree of consistency can be achieved in economic policies and development directions. A major obstacle currently hindering the free flow of goods is the monopoly of shipping by a small number of countries. The exercise of this monopoly power is now harming the interests of those countries that need to develop trade and commerce. Therefore, it is in the public interest to restrict or even eliminate as much as possible the power of these large shipping groups to maliciously discriminate against the interests of other countries. In order to establish the economies of these countries on the basis of true economic differences in costs, and not just relying on accidental factors, it is also necessary to reduce and gradually eliminate imbalances in wage systems, working conditions, and protective legislation.

    In order to promote the development of trade in these countries, it is necessary to abolish all restrictive measures currently implemented that discriminate against other countries, especially the blockade against China. All countries, especially Japan, should be allowed to develop trade relations without hindering their natural development.

    Japan is a country that has reached a high level of industrial development and technical skill and experience. It has a very important role to play in the rapid economic development of the countries in this region that we expect. In order to play this role, Japan must apply its resources, technology, and experience to peaceful tasks, thereby finding an increasingly expanding market for its industrial products and contributing to the development and prosperity of the entire region. Japan's economy has not developed normally because it is restricted to engaging in war purposes. It is under pressure not to enter the large and growing markets. The internal adjustments of economic life necessary for its own development have been hindered by the same factors. It can be expected that the increasing unity of the Asian economy will enable Japan to more easily eliminate this hindrance, enabling it to make an important contribution to the development of this entire region.

    Intra-regional trade in this region will definitely become an increasingly important factor in the future. Therefore, it is best to formulate some coordinated measures to promote and develop this factor in accordance with the principles of mutual benefit and avoiding conflicts of interest as much as possible.

    Before concluding this speech, for the sake of convenience, let me present the main points of this statement. These points are:

    (1) Lasting peace can only be based on building the economy of each country in this region on a solid and progressive foundation.

    (2) The economies of most countries in this region are being hindered by oppressive factors; the role of these factors must be reduced, and the forces of internal expansion must be allowed to play their full role as soon as possible.

    (3) These countries must combine complete autonomy and self-reliance for their own benefit, and also for the benefit of world peace, and fully develop the creativity of their people to engage in development and construction work. Their huge source of human power is a highly valuable wealth, which must be fully utilized to increase prosperity and trade.

    (4) There is enormous potential for the development and expansion of intra-regional trade in this region. This potential must be realized through meticulous, planned, and joint measures. The natural development path of trade in this region has been hindered by historical factors and trade discrimination. Trade must be promoted to allow its natural exchange, free from any artificial obstacles.

    (5) Japan has a major role to play in the development of this region. It is most beneficial for Japan to use its resources for peaceful endeavors and to develop close cooperative relations with other countries in the region—especially with China. The same is true for Australia and New Zealand. Australia and New Zealand are actually also part of this region. For their own benefit and for the benefit of peace, they must also cooperate closely with the people of other countries in this region. Australia and New Zealand also have the potential to play an important role in the economic development in this region. We hope that they will recognize the need to adapt to the needs of the situation.

    (6) Asian unity is necessary for the growth and development of this region. Therefore, this unity must be carefully cherished. At the same time, specialized agencies must be established to continuously study and consider the common problems in this region.

    Most countries in this region have common needs, common problems, and even common sufferings. War will make them lose everything and will not give them any benefits. This is even more the case for them than for other countries in the world. For them, peace is not only a social ideal worth pursuing, but also an urgent economic need. Without peace, they will forever be poor, have prevalent diseases, and be unable to resist various serious dangers from within and without.

    On the other hand, their economic weakness will give powerful countries the opportunity to use them as tools to implement their policies and make them obey the interests of these countries. Peace is necessary for economic development, and the strength of Asia built on the basis of common needs and common interests is a necessary bulwark of peace. We must build this bulwark as soon as possible, so we must work with enthusiasm, use our intelligence, and have confidence in peace. We must achieve peace and dedicate ourselves to peace.

    和平的经济
    ——印度代表团副团长杰安·昌德关于经济交流的补充报告
    一般都认为，没有健全的经济基础，持久的和平是既不能得到也不能保持的。因此，不论从国内或国际的观点看来，极端重要的一件事就是正确地处理突出迫切的经济问题，并由各国在国内和在国际上采取协同一致的办法本着公正的精神来加以解决，同时适当照顾到某些国家的特殊需要，以及所有国家的福利。
    在第一次世界大战以后的大约七年之内，即到一九二五年，世界已经在很大程度上实现了经济的恢复。现在，战争结束也已七年，但世界经济的窘迫仍然极其严重。这主要由于朝鲜战争，极大规模的重整军备，和某些殖民国家的不愿承认或满足许多国家中人民的正当的民族要求。
    大家都清楚地知道，自从一九五○年以来，形势已经恶劣得多了。人民的生活水准已经大大降低了。大多数国家的经济发展受到阻滞与妨害。特别是亚洲和大多数太平洋区域国家，粮食、生产设备和其他经济发展所必要的条件的缺乏已经很严重，并且引起了广泛的经济困难。许多国家的经济已经窘困到了将要崩溃的地步，而且，更坏的是在一九四五年以后曾经被阻止甚至被打退的反动的经济与社会趋势又抬了头。除非加以反击，这种反动趋势似乎又将重新取得优势，而损害这些国家人民的最大利益。当前紧急的任务，在于采取国际规模的行动，不仅来缓和经济的紧张情势，而且促进共同合作的努力，以便挽回大局，并发挥人民的经济能力与资源，用于和平事业，譬如：同时改革和发展这些国家的经济，减轻和逐步消灭饥饿，防止和战胜疾病，提高人民的文化水平，并在一个普遍善意和真诚国际合作的组织中去实现这种目的。
    这些考虑，不必要多说，特别适合于这个区域中的绝大多数国家，也就是和我们这次会议关系最大的国家。这些国家的经济除了三四个显著的例外，都是落后的。它们的生产技术都是古老的，实际上没有改变过，尽管过去一个半世纪技术上已有使人几乎难以置信的进步。它们国内的经济关系，非但使人民大众遭到不应遭到的极端困苦，不给他们得到发展和公平待遇的起码机会，它们国内的经济关系实质上是压迫的关系；它们已在进行的工业化，不但完全不充分，而且是不平衡的。这种工业化在计划和执行时并不是首先从这些国家的利益出发。这种工业化在大多数情形之下，使这些国家在经济上处于倚赖和从属于强大外国利益的地位。
    这些国家主要是农业国，但是农村经济不但在技术上极端落后，还要供养寄生的利益集团；耕种单位大都是不经济而且浪费的，并且对于绝大多数的耕耘者说来，由于多年来不断受到种种折磨，由于他们处境艰难，为了勉强维持可怜的生活而不得不进行继续不断而多半不成功的斗争，他们的经济精力的主要源泉已经枯竭。
    这些因素的作用所造成的总的后果，就是一种不稳定的和垂死的经济，这种经济意味着人民大众的极度穷困和贫乏，经济力量集中，外国利益集团控制着这些国家中的最重要的经济命脉。这些情况很明显地是和持久和平的维护互不相容的，要使这些国家争取并维护和平，第一个基本条件便是，除了在政治上还没有独立的国家取得独立外，它们必须得到经济上决定与行动的完全自主权，必须无限制地控制它们经济中所有战略性部门，并且要能够抵抗强国的压力。这些强国过去和现在都在利用这些国家对粮食和其他必需品的迫切需要，而迫使政治上还保持独立的国家接受它们的见解和政策。
    这些国家需要技术和经济的援助，但是它们从来没有在符合他们真正经济自由的条件下得到援助。每当这些国家在经济自主和外国经济援助两者之间必须有所选择的时候，为他们的最大利益着想，他们应该毫不踌躇地选择经济的自主。这是从过去和现在的经验中得来的一个教训，任何一个国家如果不理会这个教训，不但会给自己造成严重的损害，而且会延长垂死的帝国主义经济的生命。这也就会严重地妨害它自己的前途与和平事业。事实上，他们必须采取协同一致的办法清除他们经济上旧的残余，完全掌握工业，特别是基本工业和决定性的经济活动。
    当然每一个国家可以选择自己的补救经济的方法和步调，但是在这个区域里没有一个国家能够自认为是真正自由的，而且也不应该自认为真正自由，除非它能驾驭自己的经济来适应自己的需要。可是，如果不实现真正本国的控制、取消在许多重要方面外国对经济生活的控制，那末这一点就不可能达到。
    我现在提出的这个意见与下面这点意见并无抵触，即是说，真正名符其实的经济合作是需要的，也是应该促使它实现的。不论明的暗的，没有任何条件的经济援助，当然应该欢迎——越多越好。
    在这个意义上，经济自主决不是说经济闭关主义或经济停滞。对于这些国家来说，展开与维持高速度的经济发展是极为重要的。同时，还必须保持它们的自由，谋求国内的安定和满足在迅速觉悟中的群众的需要。经济自主和自力更生一定要相辅并进。任何国家都应该利用它自己的人力，而且在很大程度上利用它自己的物力，来完成自己的经济解放。
    这些国家有着几乎无限的贮藏的能力、社会的热忱以及可以利用的潜在力量，只要他们懂得这些力量的基本重要性，并且采取必要的步骤去加以利用。中国人民——我们所敬佩的主人，在过去三年中，就曾大规模地证明了我们在这方面可能获得什么样的成就，也证明了行动中的群众是能够移山倒海的。
    再重复一遍，每个国家都应该选择它自己的道路，找出进入满藏着未被发觉的财富的宝库的秘诀，从而获得有无限发展前途的生活。在亚洲各国和大多数的太平洋区国家里，这项工作必须立即进行，不容许再耽搁下去。
    不管这一项工作用什么方式来进行，对于群众来说，都应该是适应他们的需要而发挥他们的创造力，消灭经济生活中倒退的因素和改正历来存在的种种不妥当措施。除非群众能够看见他们将来会有和他们的明白的命运相称的那种物质生活和重作新人所实现的完满的生活，他们是不会积极行动起来的。有了这种前途，很明显，他们就能够把为了公私事业所必须的自我克制的精神提到很高的程度。
    给群众以技术指导和训练自然是很重要的，但这其实是对人力资本的社会投资，一旦全体人民听到了前途对他们的号召，并且对这号召建立了蓬勃的信心，因而起来响应这号召的时候，就可能提供出这种资本。这些国家，不管是大胆的或怯懦的，都不信赖外国的援助计划，因此不得不在政治上冒着极大的风险，依靠他们自己各别的和在某种程度上依靠集体的努力，来取得经济的扩大和发展。
    为了使人民充分发挥自己的作用，必须让他们共同参加形成和发展这些国家经济生活的艰巨事业。他们不应当只作为执行上面所规定的政策的被动工具，而应当是制订和实施政策的积极成员；应当让他们对于自己的作用有必要的了解；而且还要给他们发挥作用的机会。这样才是真正的经济民主和发展，以及从各个阶层的人民中间训练干部——特别是从有史以来被重担压得一声不响的非特权阶层中间去训练。这就意味着取得管理经济生活的新技术并且废除一切独占的经济特权。
    这些考虑对于印度和对于这个区域的国家同样有效，由于和我们当前的经济问题有关系，所以被提出来。既然取得了政治独立，我们就必须利用它来取得经济上的自主和自立。印度内部的困难已造成了一种需要尽早缓和的局势和物资匮乏的情形。
    目前印度各地都闹饥荒。这在最初虽然是天旱所造成的，但是由于大规模的重整军备引起了通货膨胀，使得粮价抬高，人民的痛苦更大。关于印度必需品方面能够而且应当做到大量自给的看法，在某种程度上已为大家所接受，但是它的错综复杂还必须加以澄清，以使作为制定公共政策的基础。
    印度十分了解亚洲团结一致作为对和平事业的贡献的重要性，但是我们还必须在思想上和以后在行动上把实现这种团结的办法付诸实施。
    我希望这次会议能为这些问题的进一步了解铺平道路，并且建立一个机构继续研究共同问题，研究在国际的基础上解决这些问题的办法。在这一方面，我们应当以实验的精神以经验来指导，采取有计划的步骤实行使亚洲和太平洋区域经济团结日益增强的政策。
    在贸易方面，过去这些国家之间的商务关系主要是由历史的因素决定的，这些历史因素目前已经不存在了，或者是逐渐失去了重要性。如果能够在这个区域里发展区域内的贸易，自然是很好的一件事，但是事情很明显，这种贸易的发展将由每一个国家经济上的分工或专门化的程度所决定。
    过去在这个区域内限制各国之间贸易发展的一个十分重要的因素就是：这些国家的经济基本上是类似的，因而交换特产的范围很狭小。随着这些国家工业化的迅速发展，而事实上也会如此，这一因素的重要性将会减少。
    如果对于有关共同利益的问题越来越多采取协商办法或采取其他方式，经济政策和发展方向是可以达到某种程度的一致的，目前阻碍商品自由流通的一个主要障碍就是少数国家对于航运的垄断。这种垄断权的行使现在正妨害着那些需要发展贸易和商业的国家的利益，因此，限制甚至尽可能取消这种大航运集团恶意歧视其他国家利益的权力，是合乎大众的利益的。为了使这些国家的经济建立在成本的真正经济差别的基础上，而不只是依靠偶然的因素，减低并逐渐取消工资制度、工作条件以及保护立法上的不平衡，也是必要的。
    为了促进这些国家贸易的发展，必须废除目前施行的一切歧视其他国家的限制措施，特别是对中国的封锁。应该让一切国家，特别是日本，发展贸易关系，而不要妨害它的自然发展。
    日本是一个在工业发展上和技术熟练及经验上已达到高度水平的国家，它对于我们所期待的这个区域的国家的经济的迅速发展，要起非常重要的作用。为了起这个作用，日本必须把它的资源、技术和经验应用到和平的任务上来，从而为它的工业品找到日益扩大的市场，并有助于整个区域的发展和繁荣。日本的经济因为被限制于从事战争目的而得不到正常的发展，它受到压力不能进入消纳量很大而且在日益增大的市场。为了它本身的发展所必须的经济生活的内部调节，已受到同样因素的妨碍。可以这样期望，亚洲经济的日益团结将使日本能够比较容易地消除这种妨害，使它能够对这整个区域的发展作重要的贡献。
    这个地区的区内贸易一定会成为今后一天比一天重要的一个因素。因此最好制订一些协同一致的措施，依照相互有利并尽可能避免利害冲突的原则，促进并发展这个因素。
    在结束这个发言之前，为了方便起见，把这个声明的要点提出来。这些要点是：
    （一）只有在使这个区域的每个国家的经济建筑在一个稳固和进步的基础上，持久和平的基础才能奠定。
    （二）这个区域的大多数国家的经济正受到压制因素的阻碍；必须减少这些因素的作用，并且尽速使得内部的扩展力量充分发挥作用。
    （三）这些国家为了他们自己的利益，同时也是为了世界和平的利益，必须将完全的自主与自立结合起来，并且充分地发展他们人民的创造力，以从事发展和建设工作。他们的巨大的人力的源泉正是具有高度价值的财富，必须充分利用来增进繁荣和贸易。
    （四）这个区域的区内贸易有巨大的发展与扩大的可能性。这种可能性必须通过缜密的有计划的共同措施才能付诸实现。这个区域的贸易的自然发展道路，曾经为历史的因素与贸易上的差别待遇所妨害。贸易必须加以促进，使其自然交流，不受任何人为的阻碍。
    （五）对于这个区域的发展，日本要起很大的作用。利用自己的资源于和平事业和发展与这个地区的其他国家——尤其是与中国——之间的亲密的合作的关系，对日本说来最是有利。对于澳大利亚与新西兰说来也是一样。澳、新两国实际上也属于这个地区。为了他们自己的利益，为了和平的利益，他们也必须和这个地区其他国家的人民亲密合作。对于这区域里的经济发展，澳、新两国也有可能发挥重要的作用。我们希望他们会认识到有必要适应局势的需要。
    （六）亚洲的团结对于这个区域的成长与发展是必要的。因此必须慎重地爱护这个团结。同时，必须设立专门机关继续不断地来研究和考虑这个区域的共同问题。
    这个区域的大多数国家，都有共同的需要，共同的问题，甚至有共同的苦楚。战争会使他们失去一切，而不会给他们任何好处。比起世界上其他国家来，他们更是这种情形。对于他们来说，和平不仅是一个值得追求的社会理想，而且是一个迫切的经济需要。没有和平，他们将永远贫穷、疾病流行，而且抵御不了内部和外来的种种严重危险。
    另一方面，他们在经济上的软弱，将使强国有机会利用他们作为实现其政策的工具，并使他们服从这些国家的利益。和平为经济发展所必需，而建筑在需要一致和利益一致的基础上的亚洲的力量，则是和平的必要的堡垒。我们必须尽早把这个堡垒建立起来，因此我们就必须满腔热情，运用才智并对和平满怀信心地进行工作。我们一定要实现和平，并且献身于和平。（新华社）
