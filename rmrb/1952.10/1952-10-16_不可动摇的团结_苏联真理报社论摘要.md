    Unshakable Unity
    ——Summary of a Pravda Editorial
    How many great events, truly historical events, have already taken place in the halls of the Kremlin! Future generations of historians, writers, and artists, when studying the Stalin era, will draw inspiration from the various congresses held by this great party, the Lenin-Stalin party, which solved many issues of world-historical significance, and from the historical meetings held in this hall by party and government leaders with workers, peasants, and intellectuals.
    Year after year, these events have more vividly and clearly demonstrated the ever-growing strength of our socialist system. Its strength lies in the spiritual and political unity of our society. Its strength lies in the unshakable and unbreakable unity of the people and their own party—the fighting alliance of like-minded communists—around their great leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin.
    During the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, this unity has manifested itself in all its greatness and spiritual beauty.
    Comrade Stalin's recent brilliant work, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," published shortly before the opening of this Party Congress, illuminates the path for the Soviet people and all mankind. Armed with Stalin's thought, the Party Congress formulated a plan for building communism. The delegates to the Congress, representing the entire Party and all the Soviet people, expressed their gratitude to Comrade Stalin in the most heartfelt terms.
    Representatives of fraternal Communist Parties and other working-class parties from various countries also spoke heartfelt words, just like the delegates of the Congress. Their enthusiastic and moving congratulations and telegrams vividly illustrated the strength and unity of the peace and democracy camp, and their loyalty and love for Comrade Stalin, the leader, teacher, and friend of the people of all countries.
    Yesterday's final meeting, especially the scene when Comrade Voroshilov, the chairman of yesterday's meeting, invited Comrade Stalin to speak, movingly demonstrated the unshakable unity and cohesion between the entire Party and its leader.
    The fervent atmosphere among all attendees at that time was unprecedented, and even in a language as rich, vivid, and expressive as our great Russian language, it is difficult to find suitable words to describe it. The delegates to the Congress—party leaders tempered in the hardships of life, white-haired scientists, world-renowned military figures who had performed heroic deeds, writers, famous Stakhanovite workers, and collective farmers—all the living embodiment of the best qualities of our people, all stood up, clapping excitedly, and the hall resounded with shouts of "Hurrah!" Representatives of fraternal parties from various countries, such as Maurice Thorez, Wilhelm Pieck, Bolesław Bierut, Klement Gottwald, Mátyás Rákosi, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Vălko Chervenkov, Dolores Ibárruri, and others, also joined the delegates in hailing the leader and teacher of the people of all countries.
    Comrade Stalin's speech will be an invaluable aid to the international revolutionary workers' movement. It will illuminate the path of this movement, and it will be repeatedly studied by the people of all countries and all continents.
    We Soviet communist fighters, the "shock brigade," will also be inspired by this speech, gain new strength, and unwavering confidence in the inevitable final victory of the great ideals of Lenin and Stalin.

    不可动摇的团结
    ——苏联真理报社论摘要
    在克里姆林宫大厅里已经发生多么多的伟大事件，真正历史性的事件啊！今后多少代的历史家、文学家、艺术家在研究斯大林时代时，将从这个伟大的党、列宁—斯大林党所举行的、解决了许多具有世界历史意义的问题的各次代表大会中，从党与政府领袖和工人、农民、知识分子在这个大厅里所举行的历史性的会议中得到启示。
    年复一年，这些事件更加生动地、清楚地显示了我们社会主义制度力量的不断增长。它的力量就在于我们社会的精神和政治的团结。它的力量就在于人民和他们自己的党——思想一致的共产主义者的战斗联盟——围绕在他们的伟大领袖与导师斯大林同志周围的不可动摇的、牢不可破的团结。
    在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会开会期间，这种团结已经以其全部的伟大和精神上的美显示出来。
    在这次党代表大会开会前不久发表的斯大林同志最近的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，照亮了苏维埃人民和全人类的道路。党代表大会以斯大林思想为武器，制订了建设共产主义的计划。大会的代表们代表全党和全体苏维埃人民，用最由衷的词句表达了他们对斯大林同志的感激。
    各国兄弟共产党和其他工人阶级政党的代表也和大会代表一样说出了衷心的话。他们的热情的、动人的贺词和贺电生动地说明了和平民主阵营的力量和团结，说明了他们对各国人民的领袖、导师和朋友——斯大林同志的忠诚和爱戴。
    昨天的最后一次会议，特别是昨天的会议主席伏罗希洛夫同志请斯大林同志发言时的景象，动人地表现了全党与领袖间的不可动摇的团结和一致。
    当时全体与会者那种热烈的情况是空前的，甚至在像我们伟大的俄罗斯语言这样丰富、生动和富有表现力的语言里，也难于找得出适当的字句来加以形容。大会的代表们——在艰苦的生活中百炼成钢的党的领袖，白发的科学家，举世闻名的、曾经创造英雄业绩的军人、作家、著名的斯塔哈诺夫式工作者和集体农民——我们人民的一切优秀品质的活的体现者全都站了起来，激动地鼓着掌，全场震响着一片“乌拉”的声音。各国兄弟党的代表，如莫里斯·多列士、威廉·皮克、波列斯拉夫·贝鲁特、克利门特·哥特瓦尔德、玛吉阿斯·拉科西、乔治乌—德治、维尔科·契尔文科夫、多洛列斯·伊巴露丽等人，也都和代表们一道，向这位各国人民的领袖和导师欢呼。
    斯大林同志的演说对国际革命工人运动将是非常宝贵的援助。它将照耀着这个运动的道路，它将被一切国家、一切大陆的人民反复地研读。
    我们苏维埃共产主义战士“突击队”也将从这篇演说中得到鼓舞，得到新的力量和对列宁和斯大林的伟大理想必然取得最后胜利的不可动摇的信心。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科十五日电）
