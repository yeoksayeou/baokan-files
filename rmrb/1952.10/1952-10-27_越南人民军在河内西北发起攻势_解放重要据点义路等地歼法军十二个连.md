Xinhua News Agency, October 26th Dispatch from North Vietnam:  Between October 14th and 20th, the Vietnamese People's Army, in battles to attack the invading French army's Northwest Military District, liberated the important stronghold of Nghia Lo and the entire vast, fertile rice-producing area on the right bank of the upper Red River, eliminating twelve battalions of the invading French army.

According to an announcement by the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army: In the area between the upper Red River and the Black River in northwestern Vietnam, from October 14th to 16th, the Vietnamese People's Army crushed several outpost strongholds of the invading French army's Nghia Lo military sub-district. On the evening of the 17th, they captured Nghia Lo city, the center of the Nghia Lo military sub-district, and pursued the fleeing French army in a victorious advance. As of October 20th, according to incomplete statistics, the Vietnamese People's Army eliminated twelve battalions of the invading French army, with prisoners accounting for the majority, including all personnel of the French army's Nghia Lo military sub-district headquarters. The Vietnamese People's Army also seized a large quantity of weapons and a large amount of ammunition, food, and other military supplies stored in various strongholds.

The Nghia Lo area is part of the region where the Thai people of northwestern Vietnam live. The French colonialists implemented their sinister "divide and rule" policy in Vietnam, establishing a so-called "Thai Autonomous State" in the Thai-populated area and building a Northwest Military District in this area in an attempt to occupy and hold it firmly. The French army's Nghia Lo military sub-district was one of the four military sub-districts of this French military district. The French army established a defensive line centered on Nghia Lo, including a series of strongholds, as a barrier for the entire Northwest Military District.

At the beginning of the battle to attack the French army's Nghia Lo military sub-district, the Vietnamese People's Army first captured the French army strongholds of Dong Bo, Thuong Pong Lo, Nam Me, Bac Han, Ca Vinh, and Chai Mong in three days from October 14th to 16th, eliminating the French army at these strongholds. After these victorious battles, the Vietnamese People's Army occupied Nghia Lo, controlled the entire 80-kilometer-long highway between Yen Bai and Nghia Lo, and expanded the anti-war base area on the right bank of the Red River. On October 18th, the Vietnamese People's Army continued to remove the French army stronghold of Qua Nhi on Highway 16 and pursued the French army that fled in a panic from Gia Hoi, north of Nghia Lo. During the same period, the Vietnamese People's Army also removed the French army strongholds of Nha Phu and Pin Mo in the Phu Yen area. The pursuit battle is still ongoing. The Vietnamese people in this area, who have suffered greatly from the French army's forced labor, grain plundering, and exorbitant taxes, warmly welcome and support the Vietnamese People's Army. In Chai Mong, an old man warmly shook the hand of a Vietnamese People's Army soldier and said, "We have been waiting for you to come. We know that Chairman Ho will not forget us."

TASS, Moscow, October 26th:  Major General Moskovsky published a commentary in "Pravda" on the 25th analyzing the situation in Vietnam, stating: The French colonialists have suffered extremely heavy losses in manpower and material resources. From December 1946 to June 1952, the Vietnamese People's Army eliminated 219,346 French officers and soldiers. Currently, more than 90 percent of the country's territory (with a population of approximately 20 million) is under the control of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The commentary then pointed out: The situation in North Vietnam has become very unfavorable for the invading French army. As of mid-October of this year, the French army in North Vietnam only held a narrow strip of land along the Red River and Black River, as well as the cities of Hanoi, Haiphong, and Mong Cai. The French army has built solid fortifications around these strongholds. In recent days, the People's Army troops launched an offensive northwest of Hanoi, liberating the important French stronghold of Nghia Lo and a large new area. They eliminated twelve battalions of the French army, seized many weapons, and captured many prisoners. Under the continuous attacks of the People's Army, the French army is retreating steadily.

Moskovsky concluded by writing: The situation in Vietnam has once again proven that the people of colonies and dependent countries are putting up more resolute resistance to the imperialist enslavers.

    越南人民军在河内西北发起攻势
    解放重要据点义路等地歼法军十二个连
    【新华社二十六日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：在十月十四日到二十日之间，越南人民军在进攻侵越法军西北军区的战斗中，解放了侵越法军的重要据点义路和红河上游右岸全部广阔的肥沃产米地区，歼灭了侵越法军十二个连。
    据越南人民军总司令部公布：越南人民军在越南西北部红河上游和黑水江之间地区，于十月十四日到十六日，粉碎了侵越法军义路军分区的前哨据点多处后，十七日晚攻克了义路军分区的中心义路城，并乘胜追击溃逃的法军。截至十月二十日为止，据不完全的统计，越南人民军歼灭了侵越法军十二个连；俘掳的占其中大部分，包括法军义路军分区司令部全部人员在内。越南人民军并缴获了大量武器及积存在各个据点中的大量弹药、粮食和其他军用品。
    义路地区是越南西北部泰族人民聚居地区的一部分。法国殖民者在越南实施“分而治之”的罪恶政策，在泰族聚居地区设立了一个所谓“泰族自治邦”，并在这地区建立了一个西北军区，企图盘踞固守。法军义路军分区，是这个法军军区的四个军分区之一。法军以义路为中心建立了一条包括一系列据点的防线，作为整个西北军区的屏障。
    在进攻法军义路军分区的战斗展开之初，越南人民军首先在十月十四日到十六日三天中一举攻下了东菩、上朋罗、南媚、北汉、歌永与柴蒙等法军据点，消灭了这些据点的法军。经过这些胜利战斗之后，越南人民军攻占了义路，掌握了安沛与义路间全长八十多公里的公路，扩大了红河右岸的抗战根据地。十月十八日，越南人民军继续拔除了第十六号公路上的法军据点寡尔，追击从义路以北佳会慌忙逃走的法军。同一期间，越南人民军并拔除了富安地区的法军据点雅富和贫莫。追击战斗现仍继续进行中。在这个地区中饱受法军拉夫、夺粮和横征暴敛之苦的越南人民，热烈欢迎和拥护越南人民军。在柴蒙，一位老人热烈地握着一名越南人民军战士的手说：“我们一直都在盼望你们来，我们知道胡主席是不会忘记我们的。”
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯考夫斯基少将二十五日在“真理报”发表评论分析越南战局说：法国殖民者在人力与物力上受到了极大的损失。从一九四六年十二月到一九五二年六月，越南人民军歼灭了法军官兵二十一万九千三百四十六人。目前全国领土有百分之九十以上（人口约计二千万）在越南民主共和国政府的控制下。
    评论接着指出：北越的形势已使侵越法军感觉非常不利。到今年十月中旬为止，法军在北越仅仅据守着红河与黑水江两岸的一条狭窄地带以及河内、海防与芒街等城市，法军在这些据点的周围建筑了坚固的防御工事。这几天来，人民军部队在河内西北发动攻势，解放了重要的法军据点义路和一大片新的地区。他们消灭了法军十二个连，缴获了许多武器，捉到了许多俘虏。在人民军的不断进攻之下，法军节节败退。
    莫斯考夫斯基最后写道：越南的形势已经又一次证明：殖民地与附属国的人民都在向帝国主义奴役者进行更坚决的抵抗。
