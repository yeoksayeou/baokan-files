    "Labor Daily" is a Good Teacher for Our Worker Art Workers
    Editor's Note: The work experience of Shanghai "Labor Daily" in organizing and cultivating worker art workers is worth the reference of art work comrades from newspapers and periodicals and other amateur art organizations in various places. Now, the letters from some comrades of the "Worker Art Correspondent Artwork Research Group" of "Labor Daily" are published below:
    We are all workers and shop assistants who love art. In August 1950, our own newspaper, "Labor Daily," led us to establish a "Worker Art Correspondent Artwork Research Group." The members of our research group have grown from 28 to 195, and one large group has been divided into four subgroups (divided by region), and the subgroups are further divided into several mutual aid groups. In the past two years, in coordination with various construction movements, more than 1,670 paintings have been published in the newspaper (statistics as of July this year), and a large number of cartoons and propaganda paintings have also been reproduced in our own units. We have participated in activities such as the Shanghai Joint Art Exhibition, the East China Works Exhibition and Observation Meeting, and the Red May Workers' Art Exhibition, and some of our works have won awards. The acquisition of these achievements is inseparable from the daily cultivation and education of us by the "Labor Daily." The responsible comrades of the newspaper often give us reports, explain to us the politics, current affairs, policies, the nature and tasks of correspondents, and issues related to art creation. We discussed these issues in group meetings and created according to these instructions. After the paintings were completed, we observed and discussed them, launched criticism and self-criticism, and exchanged creative experiences. In addition, the newspaper also regularly organized writer's original manuscript observation meetings, "sick manuscript" exhibitions, sketching excursions, visits to exhibitions, and screenings of slides (art works). Through all of this, we have gradually clarified the relationship between politics and art and improved our ideological and artistic levels. Many of our comrades have gone from not being able to paint to being able to paint; from painting poorly to painting better. Many comrades have led art groups in their work units or industrial trade unions, some comrades have become members of the editorial board of the Shanghai Textile Workers' Union Pictorial, and three comrades have become art workers who have been separated from production. Our relationship with the newspaper has therefore become even closer. In addition to supplying the newspaper with paintings on weekdays, we also help the newspaper with registration, statistics, and other work. We regularly collect workers' opinions on the newspaper in order to improve our newspaper's work.
    At present, the newspaper is pointing out some shortcomings to us, asking us to strive to establish the characteristics of workers' paintings, and overcome some purely technical viewpoints in past studies. We follow this instruction and start with sketching workers' lives and production, and strive to further improve our creation politically and artistically so that we can better serve production and construction.

### “劳动报”是我们工人美术工作者的好先生

    “劳动报”是我们工人美术工作者的好先生
    编者按：上海“劳动报”组织与培养工人美术工作者的工作经验值得各地报刊和其它业余美术组织的美术工作同志参考。现在把“劳动报”的“工人美术通讯员画稿研究组”部分同志的来信发表于后：
    我们都是爱好美术的工人和店员，一九五○年八月间我们自己的报纸——“劳动报”领导我们成立了一个“工人美术通讯员画稿研究组”。我们研究组的组员已由二十八人发展到了一百九十五人，由一个大组分出四个小组（按地区划分），小组的下面又分出几个互助小组。两年来，配合各项建设运动，在报上发表了一千六百七十多幅画（今年七月为止的统计），在本单位还复制了大量的漫画和宣传画。参加了上海联合美展、华东作品观摩会、红五月工人美展等活动，其中有些作品还得了奖。这些成绩的获得是和平日“劳动报”对我们的培养教育分不开的。报社负责同志常常给我们做报告，给我们讲解政治、时事、政策和通讯员的性质、任务以及有关美术创作上的问题。我们在小组会上就根据这些问题来讨论；根据这些指示来创作。画出画来之后就观摩讨论，展开批评与自我批评，交流创作经验。另外报社还经常组织作家原稿观摩会、“病稿”展览会、远足写生、参观展览会、放映幻灯（美术作品）等活动。通过这一切使我们逐渐明确了政治和艺术之间的关系，提高了我们的思想水平和艺术水平。我们好多同志已经从不会画到能画；从画的不好到画的较好了。有许多同志领导了自己工作单位或产业工会的美术小组，有的同志已经成为上海纺织工会画刊的编委，有三位同志已经成为脱离生产的美术工作者了。我们和报社的关系也因此更紧密地联在一起，我们平日除了供给报社画稿之外还帮助报社做登记、统计等工作。经常地搜集工人对报纸的意见，以改进我们报纸的工作。
    目前报社正给我们指出了一些缺点，要我们为树立工人画的特色而努力，克服过去学习中一些单纯技术观点的偏向，我们遵从这个指示，先从画工人生活和生产速写等入手，努力使创作从政治上艺术上再提高一步，以便我们更好地来为生产建设服务。
