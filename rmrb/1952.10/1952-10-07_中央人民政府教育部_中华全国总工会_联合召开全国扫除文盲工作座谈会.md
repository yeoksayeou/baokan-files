    The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened the National Literacy Campaign Symposium from September 23rd to 27th. The meeting was attended by the heads of the Industrial and Agricultural Spare-time Education Departments of the Education Bureaus of the People's Governments of major administrative regions, the heads of the Cultural and Educational Departments of the Trade Unions, the Cultural and Educational Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee, the heads of the Cultural and Educational Departments and Bureaus of the five provinces and two cities of North China, and cadres from relevant departments such as the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, the Financial and Economic Committee, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the General Administration of Publications, and the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, totaling forty-nine people. The meeting first discussed the report by Qian Junrui, Deputy Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, on the principles of the literacy campaign, and unanimously agreed that eliminating illiteracy among workers, peasants, soldiers, working people, and worker-peasant cadres is a necessary condition for our country to carry out economic construction and democratic construction; at the same time, it is also an urgent demand of the national working people. Therefore, carrying out the literacy campaign is an urgent and major political task. Leaders at all levels should lead this movement, which has great historical significance, with the spirit of leading previous revolutionary movements. Plans must be made to basically eliminate illiteracy throughout the country in the next five to ten years. At the same time, everyone also clarified the standard for eliminating illiteracy, which is first to enable the illiterate to become literate, and then to seek consolidation. That is to say, to enable illiterate and semi-literate people to recognize about two thousand characters, be able to read popular books and newspapers, and write short articles of three to five hundred characters, and consolidate this learning achievement to lay the foundation for further study. In order to prevent and overcome the current tendency in some places to only pay attention to speed when promoting the rapid literacy method, and not to pay attention to consolidation, resulting in speed without success, creating "half-baked" and "relapsed" phenomena, as well as the deviations of being too hasty, impatient, and perfunctory, it is necessary to carry out consolidation work effectively. To this end, everyone unanimously agreed to divide the teaching into two stages: blitz and consolidation. In the blitz stage, one must learn phonetic alphabet and pinyin, recognize about two thousand characters, read several textbooks, and learn to write short articles of three to five hundred characters; in the consolidation stage, one must consolidate the learning achievements of the previous stage and appropriately improve the level of language and common sense. One should continue to read several kinds of common sense readers through the guidance of teachers and the mutual assistance of learning groups, and continue to practice writing. Tests should be conducted regularly, and a final exam should be held. Those who pass will be issued a literacy diploma by the government as a non-illiterate. Based on the above spirit of emphasizing consolidation, the meeting also listened to Lin Handa, Director of the Industrial and Agricultural Spare-time Education Department of the Central Ministry of Education, about the experience of Xiyukou Village in Wenshui County, Shanxi, and Jiang Ling, Deputy Director of the Industrial and Agricultural Spare-time Education Department, about the plan for the national literacy campaign. The participants unanimously agreed that the general goal of the national literacy campaign should be to eliminate illiteracy among cadres of national agencies, organizations, and workers and peasants within two years; to eliminate illiteracy among industrial workers nationwide within three or four years; to eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged peasants and workers in all industries nationwide within six or seven years; and to strive to eliminate all illiteracy nationwide within ten years. It was also agreed that this year's main task is to prepare for the large-scale literacy campaign in the future, and to make good preparations in terms of ideology, experience, teachers, teaching materials, and reading materials, so that the national literacy campaign can advance steadily with preparation and planning. Representatives from various regions combined this report, checked and revised the literacy plans of their respective regions, and conducted discussions on specific issues such as learning time, teacher training, organizational leadership, funding expenditures, and teaching materials and reading materials. Finally, Liu Zijiu, Minister of the Cultural and Educational Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, made a concluding report. He first elaborated on the relationship between the literacy campaign and economic construction, and then analyzed the characteristics, difficulties, and favorable conditions of the literacy campaign. He then put forward to the participants that the future task is to carry out the campaign vigorously, steadily, from point to area, and complete it within a limited time. To this end, it is necessary to strive for the support of local party committees and people's governments and give full play to the strength of the masses to overcome difficulties. At the same time, it is necessary to attach importance to summarizing the experience of key experiments, and require all regions to obtain mature, systematic, and comprehensive experience in all aspects such as blitz literacy, consolidating literacy skills, training teachers, and teaching materials and methods in one village, one factory, one street, and one agency. In this winter, we should do a good job in various preparatory tasks to lay the foundation for the large-scale literacy campaign next year. In the entire process of the movement, we should constantly carry out the struggle on two fronts. On the one hand, we must oppose conservative ideas, oppose bureaucracy that is indifferent to the urgent needs of the broad masses of workers and peasants, and oppose the outdated concepts of sticking to conventions without believing in new methods; on the other hand, we must also oppose the task viewpoints of being eager for quick success, acting rashly, and achieving speed without success, and deviations such as no preparation, no leadership, no inspection, and no summary. He also put forward preliminary solutions to several specific issues, such as workers' learning time, standards, steps, leadership, teachers, and funding.

    中央人民政府教育部
    中华全国总工会
    联合召开全国扫除文盲工作座谈会
    中央人民政府教育部、中华全国总工会于九月二十三日至二十七日联合召开了全国扫除文盲工作座谈会。出席会议的有各大行政区人民政府教育部工农业余教育处处长、工会文教部长、华北行政委员会文教局以及华北五省二市的文教厅厅长、文教局局长和中共中央宣传部、政务院文化教育委员会、财政经济委员会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、出版总署、中央人民政府财政部等各有关部门的干部共四十九人。会议首先讨论了中央人民政府教育部钱俊瑞副部长关于扫除文盲运动方针的报告，一致认为从工农兵劳动人民及工农干部中扫除文盲，是我们国家实行经济建设和民主建设的必要条件；同时，也是全国劳动人民的迫切要求。因此，开展扫除文盲运动，是一项迫切和重大的政治任务。各级领导应以领导历次革命运动的精神来领导这一个具有伟大历史意义的运动。并须定出计划，以期在今后五年至十年内基本上扫除全国文盲。同时，大家也都明确了扫除文盲的标准，首先是要使不识字者识字，然后求其巩固。这就是说，使文盲半文盲认识二千字左右，能够阅读通俗书报和写三、五百字的短文，并把这一学习成果巩固下来，打下进一步学习的基础。为了防止与克服目前有些地方在推行速成识字法时，只注意快，不注意巩固，以致速而不成，造成“夹生”“回生”现象以及过急过躁草率从事等偏差，必须切实进行巩固工作。为此，大家一致同意在教学上分成突击与巩固两个阶段，在突击阶段，必须学会注音字母与拼音、识字二千左右，读几册课本，并学会写三、五百字的短文；在巩固阶段，要把上一阶段的学习成果巩固下来并适当提高语文与常识水平，应继续通过教师的指导和学习组的互助，阅读常识读本若干种，并继续练习写作。平时进行测验，最后举行考试，及格者由政府发给识字学习的毕业文凭，作为非文盲。根据以上着重巩固的精神，会议又听取了中央教育部工农业余教育司林汉达司长关于山西文水县西峪口村的经验介绍，和工农业余教育司江凌副司长关于全国扫除文盲的计划的报告，与会者一致同意全国扫盲的总目标，应在两年内扫除全国各机关团体工农干部中的文盲；三四年内，扫除全国产业工人中的文盲，六七年内，扫除全国农民青壮年中和全国行业工人中的文盲，争取在十年内，将全国文盲全部扫除。并同意今年主要是作今后大规模扫盲运动的准备工作，要作好思想、经验、师资、教材读物各项准备，以使全国扫盲运动能以有准备有计划地稳步前进。各地代表结合这一报告，检查与修改了本地区的扫除文盲计划，并进行了学习时间、师资训练、组织领导、经费开支、以及教材读物等具体问题的讨论。最后由全国总工会文教部部长刘子久做总结报告，他首先阐述扫除文盲运动和经济建设的关系，接着分析了扫除文盲运动的特点、困难及其有利条件后，向与会者提出今后的工作任务是大张旗鼓、稳步前进、由点到面，限期完成。为此，须争取各地党委和人民政府的支持并充分发挥群众的力量，来克服困难。同时要重视总结重点试验的经验，要求各地在一个村、一个厂、一条街、一个机关取得关于突击识字、巩固读写能力、培养师资以及教材教法等各方面的成熟的系统的全面的经验。在今冬应做好各项准备工作，为明年大规模的开展扫除文盲运动打下基础。在整个运动进行中间，应不断进行两条战线的斗争。一方面要反对保守思想，反对对广大工农群众的迫切需要漠不关心的官僚主义，反对不相信新方法而墨守成规的陈腐观念；另一方面也要反对急于求成、草率从事、速而不成的任务观点，和无准备、无领导、无检查、无总结等偏差。他并对几个具体问题，如工人学习时间、标准、步骤、领导、师资、经费等，提出了初步的解决办法。　（新华社）
