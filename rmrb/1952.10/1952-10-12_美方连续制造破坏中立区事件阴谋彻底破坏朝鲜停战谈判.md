Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th -- Following Harrison's planned suspension of the armistice talks on the 8th, the U.S. side has continuously created a series of incidents to sabotage the Panmunjom conference area, and taken other provocative actions, attempting to push the negotiations to a final rupture. On the morning of the 8th, two U.S. military aircraft violated the agreement and intruded into the conference area. On the same day, after the plenary session of both delegations adjourned, the U.S. side even used artillery to bombard the side of the highway that our delegation's vehicles had to pass on their return from Panmunjom to Kaesong, conducting provocations. At around 7:00 PM on the same afternoon, the U.S. side shelled the conference area. On the 9th, U.S. aircraft conducted provocative bombing and strafing along the edge of the Kaesong neutral zone throughout the day.

Since August, the U.S. side has been insisting on longer and longer recesses, and creating more and more incidents that violate the agreement. They have used artillery to bombard the conference area, sent aircraft to intrude into the conference area, dropped slanderous leaflets in the conference area, used the conference area as a passage for secret agents to enter and exit our area, and dispatched plainclothes secret agents to the conference area to carry out kidnapping. Their various despicable incidents of sabotaging the agreement have emerged one after another, with over eleven formal protests lodged by our side. After Harrison announced an indefinite recess, the U.S. side immediately stepped up the creation of incidents. Their intention is obviously to gradually tear up the agreement on the conference area and the neutral zone, thereby completely destroying the Korean armistice talks.

    美方连续制造破坏中立区事件阴谋彻底破坏朝鲜停战谈判
    【新华社开城十日电】继哈利逊在八日有计划地中止停战谈判之后，美方更连续制造一连串破坏板门店会场区的事件，并采取其它挑衅行动，企图把谈判推向最后破裂。八日上午，美方军用飞机两架破坏协议侵入会场区。同日，双方代表团大会休会后，美方竟用大炮轰击我方代表的车辆从板门店返回开城必经的公路的侧面，进行挑衅。同日下午七点钟左右，美方炮击会场区。九日，美机整日在开城中立区边沿进行挑衅性的轰炸和扫射。
    从八月以来，美方坚持休会的时间愈来愈长，制造破坏协议的事件也愈来愈多。他们用大炮轰击会场区，派飞机侵越会场区，在会场区投掷诬蔑性的传单，把会场区用作特务出入我区的通道，派遣便衣特务到会场区来进行绑票。他们的各种卑鄙的破坏协议事件，层出不穷，经我方正式抗议的，就有十一次之多。哈利逊宣布无限期休会后，美方立即加紧制造事件，其意图明显地是要逐渐撕毁会场区及中立区协议，从而彻底破坏朝鲜停战谈判。
