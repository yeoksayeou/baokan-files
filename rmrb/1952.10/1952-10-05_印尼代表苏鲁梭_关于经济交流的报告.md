    Chairman and esteemed gentlemen:

    First, please allow me to thank you for giving me this opportunity to report on the issue of economic exchange at this conference.

    We know that the Asia-Pacific region has over sixteen billion people, accounting for more than two-thirds of the world's population. In addition to its large population, this region, especially Southeast Asia, is a major producer of raw materials and also a vast market.

    Southeast Asia possesses abundant natural resources and diligent and intelligent working people. Its rubber production accounts for 90 percent of the world's total, and tin accounts for 66 percent of the world's total.

    Indonesia alone possesses one-third of the world's total rubber production and one-fifth of the world's total tin production, and its oil production is also considerable.

    In addition to the above-mentioned products, Southeast Asia also produces oil, sugar, rice, copra, timber, tea, and more. However, the economy of Southeast Asia is very backward, and the people's lives are very poor.

    The main reason for this phenomenon is that the countries in this region have never had genuine independence and mutually beneficial international trade. Such genuine independence and mutually beneficial international trade are indispensable conditions for promoting the industrialization of these countries and improving the living standards of the people.

    Undeniably, the development of international trade has great significance for Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, Thailand, Malaya, the Philippines, and even India and Pakistan. Before World War II, most of these countries did not achieve political and economic independence, and their international trade was based on serving the interests of the suzerain states. Like other economically backward countries in the Asia-Pacific region, these countries mainly relied on the export of raw materials. For example, Indonesia and Malaya relied on the export of rubber, tin, oil, and copra; Pakistan relied on the export of jute and cotton; Burma and Thailand relied on the export of rice; and Ceylon relied on the export of tea and rubber.

    The industries of these countries were very backward, and they were merely dumping grounds for the surplus goods of the suzerain states.

    Except for a few rice-producing countries, these countries generally lacked food and therefore needed to import it. For example, Indonesia needs to import about 600,000 tons of rice every year.

    The dependence of Southeast Asian countries on the export of raw materials and the import of many necessities has created extreme instability in their economies, even seriously threatening their future with economic crises and further declining living standards.

    Such a tragic scene is becoming increasingly apparent before us. The situation in Japan shows that Japan has now become a base for the economic aggression of American financial groups. Through its ruling decrees in Japan, the United States has used Japan's industry and cheap labor to manufacture many industrial products and sell them at high prices for exorbitant profits. The United States controls Japan's foreign trade. Japan urgently needs coal and salt but has to buy them from other countries at high prices, even though the Japanese people hope to establish trade relations with New China, especially to buy coal and salt from China. However, the United States, through its puppet organization, the Yoshida government, has tried every possible means to prevent Sino-Japanese trade.

    The United States controls 20 to 50 percent of the shares of more than a dozen large enterprises in Japan. The rule of American financial groups over the Japanese economy has not only caused the collapse of Japanese national capital but also subjected the economic trade of other countries to the control of American financial groups. For example, in Indonesia, more than 50 percent of national textile enterprises have already gone bankrupt.

    At a time when these countries are facing economic crises and trade difficulties, the advocacy of developing international trade plays a great role in eliminating unreasonable economic situations and improving people's living standards.

    This is especially important for Southeast Asian countries that still need to rely on one or two countries for foreign trade.

    In 1950 and 1951, exports to the UK and the US accounted for 40 percent of India's total exports, and imports from the UK and the US accounted for 42 percent. In 1950, 36 percent of the goods in Ceylon came from the UK and the US. In the Philippines, 70 percent of the goods came from the United States.

    Therefore, the policies of these one or two countries will immediately affect the economies and foreign trade of Southeast Asian countries.

    When these countries encounter economic crises, they shift the burden to Southeast Asian countries, which seriously threatens the lives and destinies of the people of Southeast Asian countries.

    Therefore, developing international trade and eliminating the phenomenon of economic monopoly and control by one or two countries is the only way to ensure our economic independence.

    But regrettably, after World War II, although some Southeast Asian countries seemed to have gained political independence in form, their colonial and semi-colonial economic foundations have not changed. In terms of foreign trade, they are still subject to unequal foreign interference, still forced to engage in unequal exchanges with certain foreign countries, and still unable to freely conduct foreign trade.

    What is different from the past is that Southeast Asian countries are now facing American imperialism. We know that when American imperialism gave the Philippines so-called independence in 1946, it forced the Philippines to accept the "Bell Trade Act."

    The same is true in Indonesia. Our Indonesian peace activists have reminded the Indonesian people to pay attention to the fact that American imperialism is attempting to establish a so-called "free trade agreement" with Indonesia.

    When the prices of Southeast Asian countries' exports rise, American imperialists threaten to stop purchasing or lower prices with substitutes until the prices fall before they buy. On the other hand, it also threatens to stop "aid" to Southeast Asian countries that accept "US aid," preventing these countries from conducting normal trade with each other and with peaceful and democratic countries.

    American imperialism also illegally used the United Nations' voting machine to pass a resolution, which is a resolution to impose an embargo on China. They have held international conferences on raw materials, manipulated by them, with the aim of controlling the consumption and production of Southeast Asian countries.

    The above facts show that American imperialism is trying its best to monopolize the foreign trade of Southeast Asian countries.

    In the United States' embargo list, Indonesia's main export raw materials such as rubber, tin, and oil, as well as the export raw materials of other Southeast Asian countries, are listed as strategic materials. In this way, American imperialism is able to control and manipulate those materials. In order to obtain cheaper tin prices, they threatened not to buy to drive down the tin prices. From April 12 to August 1, 1951, the United States lowered tin prices ten times, resulting in a decrease in tin prices from $1.505 per pound to $1.002 per pound.

    On July 16, 1952, the U.S. Senate's tin subcommittee admitted that the fall in tin prices under the coercion of the U.S. government had earned American imperialism $500 million in profits. They forced the price of rubber down by prohibiting private use of rubber and threatening to increase the production of synthetic rubber by 1 million tons per year: from $0.81 per pound in June 1951 to $0.38 per pound in April 1952. As a result, countries producing rubber and tin, such as Indonesia, Malaya, and Thailand, had to reduce their exports, which on the one hand caused raw materials to pile up and on the other hand greatly increased unemployment. In addition to reducing national tax revenue and foreign exchange, these also caused economic bankruptcy and lower living standards.

    As Indonesia has experienced, due to the result of the embargo, rubber prices plummeted, and in 1951, Indonesia lost 650 million guilders in foreign exchange. In 1950, before the embargo was implemented, Indonesia earned 1,145,000,000 guilders in foreign exchange, while in 1951, Indonesia only earned 495,000,000 guilders. The embargo not only caused the country to lose foreign exchange but also caused the people who produce rubber to suffer poverty and hardship.

    Before the embargo, Indonesian rubber producers could have an income of 1,800 guilders per month. After deducting living expenses of 450 guilders, rubber vinegar of 100 guilders, and paying 250 guilders for rubber rolling machine rent, they could have an income of 1,000 guilders per month, but after the embargo, they could only have an income of 600 guilders per month, while living and costs would cost 800 guilders. This example shows that they would have a deficit of 200 guilders per month since the embargo.

    As a result of the embargo, thousands of tons of rubber in Indonesia could not be sold and were allowed to melt, while the people of China needed this raw material. For example, as a means to meet the needs of Chinese farmers for truck and cart tires, we can see the vast market for raw materials in Southeast Asian countries. However, in January 1952, Malaya's rubber exports decreased by 21,000 tons compared to December 1951.

    I remember that Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China once said, "Blockade" and "embargo" have been used by China to eliminate the semi-colonial dependence in the Chinese economy and shorten the process of China's complete economic independence, while it is the imperialists themselves who are truly hit. These can be proved by the celebration of the National Day of the People's Republic of China held in Beijing two days ago. I would like to add here that it is our Southeast Asian countries that are suffering from the disaster of blockade and embargo.

    Southeast Asian countries have supplied the United States and other countries with many valuable raw materials for the development and recovery of the economies of those countries. However, it is regrettable that Southeast Asian countries have not obtained from these countries the products that supply their own national economic development. The necessities that Southeast Asian countries can buy from the United States and other countries for their own needs in order to develop their national industry and agriculture are now decreasing year by year in quantity.

    In 1950, Southeast Asian countries exported 1.7 million tons of rubber, an increase of 50 percent compared to 1937. Rubber exports in 1951 were even higher than in 1950. However, the import of industrial products necessary for Southeast Asian countries has greatly decreased, such as a decrease of one-third in 1950 compared to 1949. This import figure is already greatly reduced compared to the pre-war period, and the pre-war import figure of industrial products actually fell far short of meeting the needs of Southeast Asian economic development.

    This fact illustrates what materials Southeast Asian countries need and what materials Southeast Asia has supplied. Imperialist countries are unwilling to respect each other and implement mutually beneficial trade. Most of the items they supply are not necessities for the people; they sometimes also supply some industrial products, but those industrial products are things that countries can manufacture themselves, such as artificial fiber products, perfumes, soaps, shoe polish, inferior canned food, old newsprint, etc.

    This extremely deformed and unfair phenomenon exists between some Southeast Asian countries and also exists in the economic relations between Southeast Asian countries and countries outside the region. This fact not only causes losses to the people of Southeast Asia but also does not conform to Article 55 of the United Nations Charter. This article stipulates that the United Nations has a responsibility to promote "higher standards of living, full employment, and conditions of economic and social progress and development." But the United Nations has not faithfully carried out this task. On the contrary, the United Nations' passage of the embargo bill proves that the United Nations is implementing a policy that violates the Charter.

    For Southeast Asian countries, establishing economic relations based on complete fairness, reasonableness, mutual benefit, and mutual respect is a necessary way to solve the problem. At the same time, we Southeast Asian countries will not allow the existence of artificial obstacles such as embargoes, blockades, and other war measures, because these endanger peaceful relations and common cooperation between countries.

    The unity of the people of Southeast Asian countries, striving for peace, and demanding the development of peaceful and fair economic relations will enhance and promote the signing of trade agreements between countries and peoples; and through active mutual trade between Southeast Asian countries and between Southeast Asian countries and various people's democratic countries, mutual exchange of exhibitions of industrial and agricultural products and exchange of commercial delegations, so as to carry out the conclusion of various commercial agreements.

    The victory of this work will not only raise the living standards of the people of Southeast Asian countries but also be a major contribution to the prosperity and happy lives of the people of Southeast Asian countries and the people of the world.

    The bright days of the future can only exist in peaceful and just economic relations, and such economic relations can only exist when the atmosphere of war is cleared and peace is guaranteed.

    Therefore, for the happiness and prosperity of the people of the Asia-Pacific region, I propose the following three suggestions:

    (1) We must develop international trade and eliminate artificial obstacles. This will enable us to produce more rice, rubber, tin, cotton, jute, wool, tea, and enable us to trade at very reasonable and fair prices to exchange for more necessities and machinery, increase the number of employees, and improve our material living standards. This effort is inseparable from saving world peace. Therefore, I suggest: calling on the people of the Asia-Pacific region to rise up, promote the development of international trade, urge governments to eliminate various artificial obstacles, and strive to widely develop international trade; at the same time, I suggest: condemning all artificial obstacles to international trade such as blockades and embargoes and war measures that endanger international peace and cooperation.

    (2) The International Economic Conference has pointed out to the people of the world the correct path from developing international trade to improving the living standards of the people of all countries. Since the conference, trade relations between countries have begun to tend to recover and develop, and blockade and embargo measures have been opposed by the broad masses of the people. The Chinese people and the Japanese people have signed the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and have made many brilliant efforts to fully implement the trade agreement. This is a major contribution made by the Chinese people and the Japanese people to the development of international trade in the Asian and Pacific regions. Therefore, we suggest: Governments or peoples of various countries negotiate trade agreements, hold international industrial and agricultural product exhibitions, and send representatives to conduct various forms of trade contacts with each other.

    (3) The U.S. government's unreasonable coercion of the United Nations to pass the proposal to impose an economic blockade on China violates the spirit of the United Nations Charter and has not been supported by Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, India, Pakistan, and Burma, which have the largest populations and territories. This proposal hinders the major economic interests of Southeast Asian countries, which have close relations with China since ancient times, and has caused major losses to the economic recovery and development of Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, I suggest: calling on the United Nations to immediately take necessary steps to develop international trade on a worldwide scale on the basis of equality and mutual benefit among all countries, and to abolish artificial obstacles to international trade that violate the spirit of the United Nations Charter.

    Thank you. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 印尼代表苏鲁梭  关于经济交流的报告

    印尼代表苏鲁梭
    关于经济交流的报告
    主席及各位敬爱的先生：
    首先请允许我向你们致谢，因为我能够有这个机会在大会上作经济交流问题的报告。
    我们知道亚洲及太平洋区域拥有占世界人口三分之二以上的十六亿人民。除了人口众多之外，这个地区，特别是东南亚地区，是重要原料的产地，同时也是一个广大的市场。
    东南亚拥有丰饶的天然资源和勤俭而聪明的劳动人民。它的橡胶产量占世界总产量的百分之九十，锡占世界总产量的百分之六十六。
    仅是印度尼西亚就拥有世界橡胶总产量的三分之一，及世界锡总产量的五分之一，而石油产量也不算少。
    除了上述物产，东南亚也出产石油、糖、米、椰干、木材、茶等。但东南亚的经济却是很落后的，而且人民生活是很穷困的。
    造成这种现象的主要原因就是因为这个地区中的国家，从来未曾有过真正的独立与平等互利的国际贸易。而这种真正的独立与平等互利的国际贸易正是促进这些国家工业化和提高人民生活水准不可缺少的条件。
    无可否认的，发展国际贸易对于印尼、缅甸、锡兰、泰国、马来亚、菲律宾乃至印度、巴基斯坦都具有一种重大的意义。在第二次世界大战以前，这些国家大部分没有得到政治上和经济上的独立，它的国际贸易都是建筑在为宗主国利益服务的基础之上。这些国家像亚洲及太平洋区域的其他经济落后的国家一样，主要依靠原料的出口，例如印尼及马来亚依靠橡胶、锡、石油和椰干的出口，巴基斯坦依靠黄麻和棉花的输出，缅甸和泰国依靠大米的输出，锡兰依靠茶叶与橡胶的输出。
    这些国家的工业很落后，它们只是宗主国剩余物资的倾销地。
    除了少数产米国家以外，这些国家一般都缺乏粮食，因此需要输入粮食。例如印尼每年需要输入六十万吨左右的大米。
    东南亚各国之依赖原料出口和许多必需品入口的事实，造成了它们经济的极端不稳定性，甚至使他们的前途受到经济危机的严重威胁，生活水平更趋下落。
    这样的惨景越来越明显地呈现在我们的面前。日本的局势说明了日本目前已成为美国财阀经济侵略的基地。通过它在日本的统治法令，美国利用了日本的工业和廉价的劳动力制造许多工业品，而以高价抛售牟取暴利。美国控制了日本的对外贸易。日本迫切需要的煤和盐不得不以高价向别的国家购买，虽然日本人民希望与新中国建立贸易关系，特别需要向中国购买煤和盐。但美国却透过他的仆从机构——吉田政府，千方百计地阻止中日贸易的进行。
    美国在日本控制了十多个大企业的百分之二十至百分之五十的股份。美国大财阀对日本经济的统治，不但造成了日本民族资本的崩溃，而且也使其他国家的经济贸易同样受到美国大财阀的控制。例如，在印尼百分之五十以上的民族纺织企业已经倒闭。
    在这些国家面临经济危机和贸易困难的时候，发展国际贸易的主张对于消除不合理的经济情况和提高人民生活水平是有很大的作用的。
    对于对外贸易尚需依赖一两个国家的东南亚国家，这就尤为重要。
    一九五○年和一九五一年印度的出口总额中，对英美的输出占百分之四十，自英美的进口则占百分之四十二。一九五○年在锡兰，百分之三十六的商品是来自英美的商品。在菲律宾百分之七十的商品来自美国。
    因此这一两个国家的政策就会马上影响到东南亚各国的经济及其对外贸易。
    当这些国家遭遇经济危机时，它们便把这重担转嫁给东南亚国家，这样就严重地威胁了东南亚国家人民的生活与命运。
    因此，发展国际贸易与消除被一两个国家在经济上所垄断和控制的现象，是保证我们经济独立的唯一方法。
    可是令人遗憾的是第二次世界大战以后，虽然东南亚有些国家在形式上似乎已经得到了政治上的独立，但是它们殖民地与半殖民地的经济基础并未改变。在对外贸易方面它们仍受着不平等的外国干预的影响，仍然被迫对某些外国进行着不等价的交换，仍然不能自由地进行对外贸易。
    与过去不同的是，目前东南亚国家面对着的，是一个美帝国主义。我们知道，当美帝国主义在一九四六年给菲律宾以所谓独立时，它曾经强迫菲律宾接受“贝尔贸易法案”。
    在印尼也如此，我们印尼的和平运动者曾经提醒印尼人民注意美帝国主义企图与印尼成立所谓“自由贸易协定”这一事实。
    当东南亚各国的输出品价格上升时，美帝国主义者便以停购压价或利用代替品来威胁，直到落价时才购买。另一方面它又以停止“援助”来威胁接受
    “美援”的东南亚国家，阻止这些国家相互之间的及这些国家对和平民主国家之间的正常贸易。
    美帝国主义还非法地运用联合国的表决机器通过一项决议，就是对中国实行禁运的决议。他们曾经举行由他们操纵的有关原料问题的国际会议，他们的目的是要操纵东南亚各国的消费与生产。
    上面的事实说明美国帝国主义是正在竭力设法企图垄断东南亚各国的对外贸易。
    在美国的禁运货单中，印尼的主要输出原料如树胶、锡、石油，以及其他东南亚各国的输出原料，都被列入战略物资的货单中。这样，美帝国主义就能够控制与操纵那些物资。为了获得更便宜的锡价，他们用不愿购买的威吓来压低锡价。从一九五一年四月十二日至八月一日之间，美国已压低锡价十次，其结果是使锡价由每磅一·五○五美元降到一·○○二美元。
    一九五二年七月十六日，美国参议院的锡小组委员会承认：在美国政府强制下的锡价的跌落，已替美国帝国主义挣来五亿美元的利润。他们以禁止私人使用树胶，并以增加制造人造胶每年一百万吨的威胁，硬把胶价压低了：从一九五一年六月的每磅八角一分美元压低到一九五二年四月的三角八分美元。其结果是出产树胶和锡的国家如印尼、马来亚、泰国等都不得不降低其输出，因而一方面使原料堆积起来，另一方面使失业者大大增加。这些除了造成国家税收与外汇的降低以外，还造成了经济破产及生活程度的降低。
    如同印尼所体验过的一样，由于禁运的结果，橡胶价格骤跌，因而在一九五一年，印尼损失了六十五万万盾的外汇。在一九五○年，禁运未实施之前，印尼获得的外汇是一、一四五、○○○、○○○盾，而在一九五一年，印尼只获得四九五、○○○、○○○盾的外汇。禁运不仅仅使国家损失外汇，同时也使生产橡胶的人民蒙受贫穷与困苦。
    在禁运之前，印尼生产橡胶者每人每月可以有一千八百盾的收入。扣去生活费四百五十盾，树胶醋
    一百盾，缴纳辗胶车租二百五十盾外，每月能有一千盾的收入，但是禁运后，他们每月只能有六百盾的收入，而生活与成本就要支出八百盾。这例子说明，自禁运以来他们每月要不敷二百盾。
    由于禁运的结果，印尼有数以千吨计算的橡胶不能卖出而任它溶化，反之中国的人民却需要这原料。例如说，作为满足中国农民需用的卡车及大车的轮胎来说，我们就可以看出东南亚国家的原料的市场的广大。但是，在一九五二年一月，马来亚的橡胶输出比一九五一年十二月减少了二万一千吨。
    我记得中华人民共和国的周恩来总理曾经说过，
    “封锁”和“禁运”正好被中国用以肃清在中国经济中的半殖民地的依赖性，缩短中国在经济上获取完全独立自主的过程，而真正受到打击的，反而是帝国主义者自己。这些是可以从两天前在北京举行的庆祝中华人民共和国国庆获得证明的。我在这里还要补充一句，就是：遭受封锁和禁运的打击的灾害的，还有我们东南亚各国。
    东南亚国家供给了美国及其他国家以许多贵重原料，用以发展与恢复对这些国家的经济。然而使人遗憾的是，东南亚国家并没有从这些国家获得供自己国家经济发展的产品。东南亚国家所能向美国等国家买到的为自己所必需的、以便发展本国工农业的必需品，于今在数量上是一年比一年地减少了。
    在一九五○年，东南亚国家输出一百七十万吨橡胶，比一九三七年增加了百分之五十。一九五一年的橡胶输出比一九五○年还要增多。但是，东南亚国家所必需的工业品的进口却大大减少，如一九五○年比一九四九年减少了三分之一。这个进口数字比较战前业已大为减少，而战前的工业品的进口数字，实际上远不能满足东南亚经济发展的需要。
    这个事实说明了：东南亚国家所需要的是什么物资，和东南亚又供给了什么物资。帝国主义国家并不愿意彼此相互尊重和实行互利的贸易。他们所供给的物品，大部分都不是人民所必需的；他们有时也供给一些工业品，但那些工业品都是各国所能够自己制造的东西，例如人造纤维制成品，香水、肥皂、鞋油、低劣的罐头食品、旧新闻纸等。
    这种极端畸形与不公平的现象存在于东南亚若干国家之间，也存在于东南亚国家与这区域以外的国家之间的经济关系上。这事实不但造成东南亚人民的损失，而且也与联合国宪章的第五十五节条文不相符合。这条文规定联合国有责任促进“较高的生活程度，全民就业及经济与社会进展。”但是联合国并没有忠实的执行这个任务。反之，联合国之通过了禁运法案，证明了联合国是在执行着违犯宪章的政策。
    对东南亚国家来说，建立在完全公平合理、互惠互利、相互尊重的基础上的经济关系，是解决问题的必要途径。同时，我们东南亚各国将不允许人为的障碍，如禁运、封锁及其他战争措施的存在，因为这些都危害了和平的关系以及国与国之间的共同合作。
    东南亚国家人民团结一致、争取和平，要求发展和平与公平的经济关系，就会增强和促使各国与人民之间签订贸易协定；并通过积极的东南亚各国之间以及东南亚各国与各人民民主国家之间的互相贸易，相互交流展览工农业产品与交换商业代表团，以便进行订立各种的商业协定。
    这工作的胜利，不但将提高东南亚国家人民的生活水平，而且是对东南亚国家人民以及全世界人民的繁荣与幸福生活的重大贡献。
    未来的明朗的日子，是只有在和平与公正的经济关系上才能存在的，而这种经济关系又只有在战争气氛肃清与和平获得保障的情况下才能存在。
    因此，为了亚洲及太平洋区域人民的幸福与繁荣，我提出下列三个建议：
    （一）我们必须发展国际贸易，消灭人为障碍。这样才能使我们生产更多的大米、橡胶、锡、棉花、麻、羊毛、茶叶，而且能使我们以很合理公平的价格进行交易，来交换更多的生活必需品和机器，增加就业人数，提高我们的物质生活水准。这种努力与拯救世界和平是分不开的。因此我建议：号召亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民起来，为推动国际贸易与发展，敦促各国政府消除各种人为的障碍，为广泛开展国际贸易而努力；同时建议：谴责一切封锁禁运等对国际贸易的人为障碍及危害国际和平合作的战争措施。
    （二）国际经济会议已为全世界人民指出了从发展国际贸易来提高各国人民生活水准的正确道路。会议以来，各国之间的贸易关系已经开始趋于恢复与发展，封锁禁运措施受到广大人民的反对。中国人民与日本人民之间签订了中日贸易协议，而且为全部实施贸易协议作了许多辉煌的努力，这是中国人民和日本人民为开展亚洲和太平洋区域国际贸易所作的重大贡献。因此我们建议：各国政府或人民之间，商订贸易协议，举办国际工业农业产品展览，并互派代表进行各种不同方式的贸易接触。
    （三）美国政府在联合国中无理地强迫联合国所通过的对中国实行经济封锁的提案，是违反联合国宪章精神的，而且没有得到人口最多、领土最大的东南亚国家如印尼、印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸等国的支持。这个提案妨碍着自古以来就与中国有着密切关系的东南亚国家的主要经济利益，使东南亚国家经济的恢复与发展，蒙受了重大的损失。因此我建议：呼吁联合国立即采取必要步骤，以谋在各国平等互利的基础之上发展全世界规模的国际贸易，并取消违反联合国宪章精神的对国际贸易的人为障碍。
    谢谢。（新华社）
