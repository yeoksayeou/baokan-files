Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 5th: TASS Moscow dispatches: Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky received U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to the Soviet Union, Mr. Maxwell, at the Soviet Foreign Ministry on October 3rd and handed him the following note:

    “The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the honor to inform the United States Government: As is well known, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Kennan, made a statement greatly slandering the Soviet Union during a conversation with representatives of the West Berlin press and American journalists at Tempelhof Airport in Berlin on September 19th. This statement seriously violates the generally recognized norms of international law. In this statement, which was published in several West German newspapers, Mr. Kennan even compared the situation of Americans in Moscow with his experiences when he was allegedly detained by the Nazis in Germany in 1941 and 1942. Mr. Kennan said: 'If the Nazis had allowed us to walk in the streets but not allowed us to talk to any Germans, then that would be exactly the same as our situation living in Moscow today.'
    “Mr. Kennan's statement is completely untrue and hostile to the Soviet Union.
    “In view of the above, the Soviet government considers it necessary to declare that it considers Mr. Kennan to be a persona non grata and insists on the immediate recall of Mr. Kennan from the position of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union.”

    After receiving the note, Mr. Maxwell said that he would immediately deliver the note to the U.S. Government.

    苏联要求立即召回诽谤苏联的美驻苏大使
  　【新华社五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长维辛斯基于十月三日在苏联外交部接见美国驻苏联临时代办麦克斯维耐，交给他下面的照会：
    “苏联外交部很荣幸地通知美国政府：众所周知，美国驻苏联大使凯南先生九月十九日在柏林的泰姆派霍夫机场和西柏林报界代表及美国记者谈话时发表了一项声明，大肆诽谤苏联。这项声明严重地违反了公认的国际法准则。在若干西德报纸加以刊载的这项声明中，凯南先生竟把美国人在莫斯科的情况和据说是一九四一年到一九四二年他在德国被纳粹拘留时的经历来比较。凯南先生说：‘如果纳粹曾经准许我们在街上行走而不准我们和任何德国人谈话，那末，这种情况就恰恰和我们今天住在莫斯科的情况一样。’
    “凯南先生的这项声明完全是不真实的，而且是仇视苏联的。
    “鉴于上述情况，苏联政府认为必须声明，它认为凯南先生已经是一个不受欢迎的人，并且坚持立即把凯南先生从美国驻苏联大使的职位上召回。”
    麦克斯维耐在接到照会后说，他会立即把这份照会交给美国政府。
