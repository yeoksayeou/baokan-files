Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 30th – Around the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering the war in Korea – from the 21st to the 26th, the Korean and Chinese People's forces engaged in fierce blocking actions, counterattacks, and artillery battles in many locations, eliminating more than 4,000 enemy troops in six days.

The battle for two high ground positions near Shangganling, north of Jinhua, has continued for nearly half a month. In the repeated struggle for hilltop positions, our heroic defending troops often temporarily withdrew into nearby tunnel fortifications to continue fighting after inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. When the enemy barely managed to climb into the ground field fortifications, our soldiers often, under the cover of artillery fire, annihilated all the enemy troops occupying the positions in one fell swoop. In the six days since the 21st, our forces have eliminated more than 1,700 enemy troops on the two high grounds. Before the 20th, our forces had already eliminated more than 8,000 enemy troops in the battles on these two high grounds and nearby mountainous areas. Adding the results of the above six days, a total of nearly 10,000 enemy troops have been eliminated on this front, which is only more than ten li long.

In these six days, our forces also launched counterattacks against the enemy in areas west and southwest of Lianchuan, such as Gaowang-ri, Pingcun, and southeast of Jincheon, and once occupied nine enemy positions, successively eliminating one enemy company, four platoons, and one squad. Including the results of blocking actions in other areas, a total of more than 1,300 American, Canadian, and Rhee puppet troops were eliminated.

The powerful artillery units of the Korean and Chinese People's forces continuously engaged in fierce artillery battles with the enemy, killing and wounding more than 1,100 enemy troops in six days.

The frontline anti-aircraft artillery units shot down and damaged sixteen enemy aircraft in six days.

    在金化以北上甘岭附近争夺战中
    朝中人民部队半月歼敌近万名
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十日电】在中国人民志愿军出国作战两周年纪念日前后——二十一日到二十六日，朝中人民部队在许多地方进行了激烈的阻击战、反击战和炮战，六天中歼灭敌军四千多名。
    金化以北上甘岭附近两个高地的争夺战，已持续了将近半个月。在反复争夺山头阵地的战斗中，英勇的我军守备部队常常在杀伤大量敌军之后，暂时转入附近的坑道工事继续作战；当敌人勉强地爬进地面野战工事以后，我军战士又常常在炮火掩护下一举把占领阵地的敌人全部歼灭。自二十一日以后的六天中，我军在两个高地上已歼敌一千七百多名。二十日以前，我军已在这两个高地及其附近山地的战斗中歼敌八千多名，加上上述六天的战果，这条仅十多里长的战线上共计已歼敌近万人。
    在这六天中，我军又在涟川以西和西南的高旺里、坪村及金城东南等地区向敌军进行反击，一度攻占敌军阵地九处，先后共歼守敌一个连、四个排和一个班。加上其他地区的阻击战的战果，共计歼灭美军、加拿大军、李伪军一千三百多名。
    朝中人民部队的强大炮兵部队，不断与敌人进行激烈的炮战，在六天中打死打伤敌人一千一百多名。
    前线高射炮部队，六天中击落击伤敌机十六架。
