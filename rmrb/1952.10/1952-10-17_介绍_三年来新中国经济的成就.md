Since the founding of the People's Republic of China three years ago, thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, the Chinese people, just as on other fronts, have achieved brilliant victories on the economic front. To help people at home and abroad understand and study the economic development of New China, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade recently compiled the book "The Economic Achievements of New China in the Past Three Years." This book contains twenty-two important essays on finance and economics written by responsible leaders of the CCP Central Committee and the Central People's Government. The first eleven articles were written between December 1949 and June of this year, and the last eleven were written to commemorate this year's National Day. From these essays, we can not only clearly see the tremendous achievements of China's economic construction over the past three years, but also clearly see the arduous journey through which these achievements were obtained.

The first article in this book is Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on June 6, 1950: "Strive for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation." In this historically significant document, Chairman Mao brilliantly analyzed the international and domestic situation at the time, pointing out: "The current international situation is favorable to us." (Original book, page 1) However, since pre-liberation China was an economically backward semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries severely damaged China's economy. Therefore, he also pointed out: "In the newly liberated areas (with a population of approximately 310 million) ... the conditions for carrying out economic construction in a planned manner have not yet been obtained." (Original book, pages 3-4) Based on the situation at the time, Chairman Mao called on the people of the whole country and governments at all levels to work together to strive for a fundamental turn for the better in the nation's overall financial and economic situation within three years or a little longer. However, in less than three years, Chairman Mao's call has been victoriously realized through the joint efforts of the people of the whole country and governments at all levels. Comrade Bo Yibo pointed out in "The Achievements of the People's Republic of China in the Past Three Years": "Following the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, through the efforts of the people of the whole country, China's financial and economic situation has fundamentally improved in less than three years. China's industrial and agricultural production has now fully recovered and exceeded the highest pre-war levels, the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure have been completely balanced, and prices have been completely stabilized." (Original book, page 104)

Why were we able to victoriously complete this glorious task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao in such a short period of three years? First of all, it was because we followed Chairman Mao's instructions to "carry out land reform work step by step and in an orderly manner" (Original book, page 4). The article "The Great Victory of the Land Reform Movement in the Past Three Years" pointed out: Now, "the land reform movement has been basically completed nationwide. In the past three years, land reform has been completed in areas with a population of approximately 300 million agricultural people. Adding the old liberated areas where land reform was completed three years ago, the agricultural population in the areas where land reform has been completed accounts for more than 90% of the total agricultural population in the country. Except for ethnic minority areas such as Xinjiang and Tibet, and Taiwan, which is yet to be liberated, there are only 30 million agricultural people in areas where land reform has not yet been completed. These areas will also complete land reform in 1952 or at the latest before the spring plowing of 1953. In the agricultural areas of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, land reform will also be implemented this winter and next spring." (Original book, page 111)

Land reform liberated agricultural productive forces, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers for production has been unprecedentedly high. As a result, the entire agricultural production has been rapidly restored and developed. The article "The Great Achievements in Agricultural Production of New China in the Past Three Years" pointed out: "In the past three years, agricultural production has shown an upward trend year by year. ... Judging from the growth and harvest of crops in various places, this year's production plan can be completed and may even be exceeded. In this way, this year's grain output in our country will exceed the pre-war level by 9%, cotton will exceed the pre-war level by more than half, tea will increase by about two and a half times compared with 1950, flue-cured tobacco will increase by about two times compared with 1950, silkworm silk will increase by about 50% compared with 1950, and fruit production will also be greatly increased, of which citrus production has doubled." (Original book, page 129) In addition, the restoration and development of animal husbandry and aquaculture have also achieved great success.

Land reform and agricultural recovery laid the foundation for future industrialization. As Comrade Chen Yun said in the article "The Situation of Financial and Economic Work in the People's Republic of China in the Past Year" on October 1, 1950, "The purpose of restoring agriculture is to quickly solve the needs of grain and industrial raw materials (especially cotton), and at the same time open up a vast market for urban industry. After appropriate agricultural recovery, the grain supply in large cities and the raw materials for the textile industry can be independent of imperialism, and the foreign exchange consumed by grain and cotton, which has been a major import item in our country for many years, can be diverted to purchase machinery and accumulate funds for industrialization." (Original book, pages 68-69) In the past three years, based on the great victory of land reform and the rapid restoration and development of agricultural production, the restoration and development of industrial production has been very rapid. In the article "The Restoration and Development of Industry in Our Country in the Past Three Years," Comrade Li Fuchun used the figures of the restoration and development of several major industrial productions in the country over the past three years compared with the highest annual output before liberation, and pointed out eloquently: "Our industrial production in 1952, with the exception of individual products, will generally exceed, and even far exceed, the highest annual output before liberation. This will undoubtedly considerably increase the proportion of modern industry in our national economy." (Original book, page 123) Of particular note is the development of heavy industry, which has a decisive role in all industries and agriculture. "In terms of the structure of industry, there have also been certain changes in the past three years. Our heavy industry has developed more than light industry, especially the manufacture of steel and machinery, and the domestic self-sufficiency rate of various machines and industrial equipment is gradually increasing. Therefore, the comparative relationship between the total output value of light and heavy industry has also changed: in 1949, the ratio of the production of means of production to the production of consumer goods in industry was 32.5% to 67.5%; in 1952, it will be 43.8% to 56.2%." (Ibid.)

The achievements of New China's industry in the past three years are inseparable from the working class's high degree of wisdom and enthusiasm in industrial production. The article "The Chinese Working Class on the Eve of Large-Scale Economic Construction" pointed out: "In 1950, more than 683,000 workers participated in labor competitions; in 1951, 2.38 million people participated in the competition; in the first half of 1952, after the 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' movements, more than 80% of all employees participated in the patriotic production increase and economy movement. Over the past three years, the broad masses of employees have created a lot of advanced experience and put forward many rationalization proposals in all aspects such as improving machinery, improving operating methods, and improving labor organization. ... Due to the high enthusiasm for production and creativity of workers throughout the country, labor productivity has been greatly improved. The labor productivity of workers in Northeast China in 1951 has exceeded the highest level before liberation by 42%, and in the first half of 1952, it exceeded the same period in 1951 by 20.9%. ... In such a heroic undertaking, a large number of model figures have emerged. According to statistics in 1951, we already have more than 86,500 labor models." (Original book, pages 175-176)

In addition to the general recovery and development of production, in the past three years, we have also begun to carry out many large-scale construction projects at an unprecedented speed. The article "The Great Achievements of Water Conservancy Construction in Our Country in the Past Three Years" said: "In the past three years, we have carried out cultivation and repairs to most of the more than 42,000 kilometers of dikes and levees across the country. For some rivers with more serious floods, such as the Huai River, the Yi and Shu Rivers in East China, and the Yongding River, Daqing River, and Chaobai River in North China, we have already begun to carry out fundamental treatment of the entire basin. For the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, which are particularly large rivers, because the fundamental treatment projects cannot be completed in the short term, temporary and effective defense measures have also been taken to eliminate the threat of abnormal floods." (Original book, page 134) Among them, the Huai River water conservancy project and the Jingjiang flood diversion project are rare in the world in terms of their scale and speed of progress. In terms of railways, the article "The Achievements of the People's Railways in the Past Three Years" said: "In order to develop the people's economy and develop inland resources, the Central People's Government has made large investments in building new roads since the second half of 1950. ... As of the end of August 1952, a total of 1,267 kilometers of railways had been built in two years." (Original book, page 146)

As a result of the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, New China's trade work has also achieved great success. The article "The Adjustment and Development of National Commerce in the Past Three Years" pointed out that domestic trade in the past three years has been carried out on the basis of the division of labor and cooperation between the new state-owned trade, cooperative trade, and private trade. Under the policy of extensively developing urban-rural exchanges, "the national commodity turnover has been increasing year by year. If 1950 is 100, then 1951 is about 130, and the estimated minimum for 1952 is 170. The sales volume of national agricultural products, by-products, and major commodities is constantly expanding. ... In the past three years, the volume of grain, cotton cloth, and kerosene has increased by about 150%, and the volume of other major commodities has generally increased by about 50%." (Original book, page 152) Foreign trade has also shown a brand new situation. In the past three years, "we have eliminated the semi-colonial dependence of foreign trade and established new foreign trade relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. We have transformed from a country with a long-term trade deficit in history into a country with a balance of imports and exports" ("Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China in the Past Three Years," Original book, page 160).

Regarding the state's financial work, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's policy of "consolidating the unified management and unified leadership of financial and economic work, consolidating the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure, and stabilizing prices" (Original book, page 4), the tight situation of the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure has long been gone. Comrade Bo Yibo pointed out in "The Achievements of the People's Republic of China in the Past Three Years": "Our country's revenue and expenditure ... were already close to balance in 1950. In the subsequent period, due to the crazy aggression of American imperialism, we had to use a lot of force to strengthen national defense construction and support the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Even so, our national fiscal revenue and expenditure in 1951 and 1952 were not only able to maintain a balance but also had a surplus. ... In 1952, more than 50% of the funds in our national general budget were used for economic construction and cultural and educational construction." (Original book, page 108)

In general, our national economy has been fully restored in the past three years. In the future, we will embark on the road of large-scale economic construction throughout the country. The last article in this book, "The Great Victory on China's Economic Front in the Past Three Years," summarizes the tremendous achievements of China's economy in the past three years and points out: "Although the speed of our economic development is very fast, because we are a large country with the largest population in the world, the time for our industrialization will be quite long. Although the achievements of the past three years have been very great, the task of future construction will undoubtedly be more arduous than in the past. ... The people of the whole China will, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, follow the overall national construction plan, concentrate all their efforts to fight for industrialization, and fight for the bright future of socialism." (Original book, page 192)

On the eve of the upcoming climax of large-scale economic construction across the country, the book "The Economic Achievements of New China in the Past Three Years" will add a hundredfold confidence and strength to the broad masses of people.

    介绍“三年来新中国经济的成就”
    中国国际贸易促进委员会编  一九五二年十月人民出版社出版
    陈大可
    中华人民共和国成立三年以来，由于毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导，中国人民在经济战线上，也如同在其他战线上一样，已经获得了辉煌的胜利。为了帮助国内外人们了解和研究新中国经济发展的情况，最近，中国国际贸易促进委员会编纂了“三年来新中国经济的成就”一书。这本书共选辑了二十二篇中共中央和中央人民政府负责首长所撰的关于财政经济方面的重要论文。其中前十一篇是在一九四九年十二月到今年六月间撰的，后十一篇是为了纪念今年国庆节撰的。从这些论文中，我们不仅可以清晰地看到三年来中国经济建设的巨大成就，并且可以清晰地看到这些成就的取得是经过了怎样艰苦的历程的。
    这本书的第一篇文章是毛主席一九五○年六月六日在中国共产党第七届第三次中央全体会议上的报告：“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”。在这一具有历史意义的文件中，毛主席精湛地分析了当时国际国内的情势，指出：“目前的国际情况对于我们是有利的。”（原书第一页）但是，由于解放前的中国原是一个经济落后的半封建半殖民地国家，国民党反动派的长期统治，使中国的经济遭到了严重的破坏。因此，他同时又指出：“在新解放区（约有三万万一千万人口）……还没有获得有计划地进行经济建设的条件。”（原书第三——四页）根据当时的情况，毛主席号召全国人民和各级人民政府共同努力，在三年或者多一些的时期内，争取国家整个财政经济状况的根本好转。但是，现在还不到三年，毛主席的这个号召，已在全国人民和各级人民政府的共同努力下胜利地实现了。薄一波同志在“中华人民共和国三年来的成就”中指出：“按照毛泽东同志的指示前进，通过全国人民的努力，在不到三年的时间内已使中国财政经济情况根本好转了。中国工农业生产现已全部恢复和超过战前最高的水平，国家财政收支已完全平衡，物价已完全稳定。”（原书第一○四页）
    为什么在这短短的三年内，我们能够胜利地完成毛主席交给我们的这个光荣任务呢？首先就是因为我们按照了毛主席的指示，“有步骤有秩序地进行土地改革工作”（原书第四页）。“三年来土地改革运动的伟大胜利”一文指出：现在，“土地改革运动已在全国范围内基本上完成。约有三亿农业人口的地区，在这三年之中完成了土地改革。加上三年以前即已完成土地改革的老解放区，完成土地改革地区的农业人口已共占全国农业人口总数的百分之九十以上。除新疆、西藏等少数民族地区及尚待解放的台湾以外，只有三千万农业人口的地区尚未完成土地改革，这些地区也将在一九五二年内至迟于一九五三年春耕以前完成土地改革。在新疆各民族的农业区，也将于今冬明春实行土地改革。”（原书第一一一页）
    土地改革解放了农业生产力，广大农民的生产积极性是空前地高涨了。因之，整个农业生产得到了迅速的恢复和发展。“三年来新中国农业生产上的伟大成就”一文指出：“三年来，农业生产呈现了逐年上升的趋势。……从现在各地庄稼生长和收获的情形看来，今年的生产计划可以完成，并且可能超过。这样，我国今年粮食产量将超过战前百分之九，棉花将超过战前一半以上，茶叶约比一九五○年增产两倍半，烤烟约比一九五○年增产两倍，家蚕丝约比一九五○年增产百分之五十，水果产量也大大提高，其中柑桔产量增加了一倍。”（原书第一二九页）此外，畜牧业和水产业的恢复和发展，也得到了很大的成就。
    土地改革和农业恢复为今后工业化奠下了基础。正如陈云同志一九五○年十月一日在“中华人民共和国过去一年财政和经济工作的状况”一文中所说，“恢复农业的目的，在于迅速解决粮食与工业原料（尤其是棉花）的需要，同时即为城市工业开辟广大的市场。农业适当恢复之后，大城市的粮食供应与纺织工业的原料才能不依赖帝国主义，并使过去多少年来，占我们国家主要入口项目的粮食、棉花所消耗的外汇，可以转而购买机器，为工业化积累资金。”（原书第六八、六九页）三年来，基于土地改革的伟大胜利及农业生产的迅速恢复和发展，工业生产的恢复和发展是非常迅速的。李富春同志在“三年来我国工业的恢复与发展”一文中，用全国几项主要工业生产三年来恢复和发展的数字与解放前最高年产量作对比，雄辩地指出：“我们一九五二年的工业生产，除个别产品外将要普遍超过，甚至远远超过解放前的最高年产量。这无疑地会相当地提高现代工业在我国国民经济中的比重。”（原书第一二三页）特别值得注意的，是对一切工农业有决定作用的重工业的发展。“就工业的结构而言，三年来也已经有了一定的变化。我们的重工业比轻工业有更大的发展，特别是钢材和机器的制造，各种机器与工业器材的国内自给率正在逐渐增大。因此轻重工业生产总值的对比关系也已发生了变化：一九四九年工业中生产资料的生产与消费资料的生产对比为百分之三十二点五比六十七点五；一九五二年将为百分之四十三点八比五十六点二。”（同上）
    三年来新中国工业的成就，是与工人阶级在工业生产中发挥高度的智慧和积极性分不开的。“大规模经济建设前夜的中国工人阶级”一文指出：“一九五○年，有六十八万三千多工人参加了劳动竞赛；一九五一年就有二百三十八万人参加了竞赛；一九五二年上半年，‘三反’、‘五反’运动后参加爱国增产节约竞赛运动的占全体职工百分之八十以上。三年以来，职工群众对于改进机器、改进操作方法、改进劳动组织等各方面，创造了很多先进经验，提出了很多合理化建议。……由于全国工人高度发挥了生产积极性和创造性，使劳动生产率大大提高。东北工人在一九五一年的劳动生产率已超过解放前最高水平百分之四十二，一九五二年上半年又比一九五一年同期超过百分之二十点九。……在这样的英雄事业中间，涌现出大批的模范人物，据一九五一年的统计，我们已经有了八万六千五百多位劳动模范。”（原书第一七五—一七六页）
    除了一般的生产恢复和发展之外，三年来，我们还开始以空前的速度，进行着许多规模巨大的建设工程。“三年来我国水利建设的伟大成就”一文说：“三年来，我们对于全国四万二千余公里堤防，绝大部分进行了培修。对一些水灾比较严重的河流，如淮河，华东的沂河、沭河，华北的永定河、大清河、潮白河等，已经开始进行全流域的根本治理。长江、黄河这些特别巨大的河流，因为治本工程不是短期所能完成，也举办了临时性的有效的防御措施，以解除异常洪水的威胁。”（原书第一三四页）其中特别是淮河水利工程和荆江分洪工程，无论就其规模或进行速度来说，都是世所罕见的。在铁道方面，“三年来人民铁道的成就”一文说：“为了发展人民经济，开发内地资源，中央人民政府自一九五○年下半年起，即以大量投资修筑新路。……截至一九五二年八月底止，两年内业已修筑了共长一千二百六十七公里的铁路。”（原书第一四六页）
    由于工农业生产恢复和发展的结果，新中国的贸易工作也获得了很大的成绩。“三年来全国商业的调整与发展”一文指出，三年来的国内贸易是在新的国营贸易、合作社贸易和私营贸易分工合作的基础上进行着的。在广泛开展城乡交流的方针下，“全国商品流转额在逐年增加中，如以一九五○年为一○○，则一九五一年约为一三○，一九五二年预计最低为一七○。全国农产品、副产品及各主要商品的销售量正在不断扩大，……三年中粮食、棉布、煤油增加了百分之一百五十左右，其他各种主要商品一般都增加了百分之五十左右。”（原书第一五二页）对外贸易也已出现了一个崭新的局面。三年来，“我们肃清了对外贸易的半殖民地的依赖性，在平等、互利的基础上建立了新的对外贸易关系。我们已经由历史上长期入超的国家，转变成为进口和出口平衡的国家”（“中华人民共和国三年来的对外贸易。”，原书第一六○页）
    关于国家财政工作方面，在毛主席“巩固财政经济工作的统一管理和统一领导，巩固财政收支的平衡和物价的稳定”（原书第四页）的方针指导下，国家财政收支的侷促情况，也早已一去不复返了。薄一波同志在“中华人民共和国三年来的成就”中指出：“我们国家的收支，……在一九五○年已经接近了平衡。以后的时期中，由于美帝国主义的疯狂侵略，我们不得不用很大的力量加强国防的建设并支援抗美援朝。虽然如此，我们的国家财政收支在一九五一年和一九五二年不但能保持平衡而且还有结余……。在一九五二年，我们的国家总预算中，已有百分之五十以上的经费用于经济建设和文化教育建设。”（原书第一○八页）
    总起来说，三年来我们的国民经济已经全面恢复。今后，我们将走上全国大规模经济建设的道路。这本书最后的一篇文章“三年来中国经济战线上的伟大胜利”，即综述了三年来中国经济的巨大成就，并指出：“我们经济发展的速度虽然很快，但因我们是一个世界上人口最多的大国，我们工业化的时间将是相当长的。过去三年的成绩虽然十分伟大，但今后的建设工作，其任务不言而喻将比过去更为繁重。……全中国人民将要在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，学习苏联先进经验，按照国家总的建设计划，集中全力为工业化而奋斗，为社会主义的光明前途而奋斗。”（原书第一九二页）
    在这全国大规模经济建设高潮即将到来的前夕，“三年来新中国经济的成就”一书将给广大人民增添百倍的信心和力量。
