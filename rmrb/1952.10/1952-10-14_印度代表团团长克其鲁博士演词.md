Friends,

You asked me to speak in the capital of New China, at this mass meeting in this beautiful city. This is an honor for my country and for me personally. Please allow me to express my deep gratitude.

At the same time, on behalf of the sixty-odd Indian delegates participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, I express our deepest gratitude to the Chinese people.

No words can express our gratitude for the warm hospitality that the Chinese people have shown us.

For the past eleven days, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has discussed various serious and difficult issues, the resolution of which concerns the peace of Asia and the world. I declare with great confidence that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has answered these questions and pointed out solutions; if these solutions are accepted, they can and will guarantee true peace.

In the past, I have never attended such a conference, where so many men and women from various countries gathered together in such a friendly atmosphere, exchanged opinions, shared feelings, and told each other their hopes, joys, and anxieties. These people came from different social strata and held very different political views. But there was no distance between them. For the long eleven days, the delegates often discussed, debated, and argued fiercely, yet frankly and passionately—or, one might add, even continued at night. Finally, they made several important resolutions, and no one expressed dissatisfaction when each resolution was passed.

The reason for achieving such remarkable unity is precisely because we are working together to save peace and striving to achieve the deepest desires of all upright people.

I am convinced that the millions of people in India will also wholeheartedly welcome and support the resolutions passed by the conference and participate in the great peace movement.

Before ending my speech, I would also like to say that this conference has further strengthened the friendly ties between our two countries. We have seen your great achievements with our own eyes. We have seen how pleasant life is in New China. We must tell the truth about New China to our people at home and tirelessly expose the lies spread by those who try to drag us into war.

The unity of China and India is the guarantee of peace in Asia, and no force in the world can destroy the unity between these two countries!

Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people!

Long live peace!

    印度代表团团长克其鲁博士演词亲爱的朋友们：
    你们要我在新中国的首都，在这个美丽的城市的群众大会上讲话，这是我的国家，也是我个人的荣誉，请允许我表示深厚的谢意。
    同时，我代表参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的六十余位印度代表向中国人民表达我们最深切的感激。
    对于中国人民给予我们的盛情招待，任何话语都表达不出我们的感谢。
    十一天以来，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议讨论了各种严重而且困难的问题，这些问题的解决关系着亚洲与世界的和平。我以极大信心宣称，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议已经对这些问题作了答复，并且指出了解决办法；这些解决办法如果被接受，能够而且必将保障真正的和平。
    过去，我从来没有参加过这样一个会议，有这样多来自各国的男女们在这样友好的气氛里，聚集一堂，交换意见，交流情感；互相倾诉自己的希望，欢乐和忧虑。这些人来自不同的阶层，抱着非常不同的政治见解。但他们中间没有任何距离，在长长的十一天里，代表们常常激烈地然而坦白而热情地讨论着、争辩着。或者可以这样加上一句，甚至在夜里还在继续。最后，他们做出了几个重要的决议，每个决议通过时都没有任何一个人表示不满。
    所以能取得这样卓越的团结的原因，正因为我们是共同为拯救和平而努力，为达到一切正直的人们的最深切的愿望而努力。
    我确信，印度的千百万人民也将全心欢迎并支持大会通过的决议并参加伟大的和平运动。
    在结束讲话以前，我还想说的是，这次大会进一步加强了我们两国间的友谊联系。我们亲眼看到了你们的伟大成就，我们看到了在新中国，生活是怎么样的愉快。我们一定要把新中国的真实情况告诉我们国内的人民，并且不疲倦地揭穿那些企图把我们拖入战争的人们所散布的谎言。
    中国与印度的团结是亚洲和平的保证，世界上没有任何力量能够破坏这两个国家间的团结！
    中印两国人民友谊万岁！
    和平万岁！
