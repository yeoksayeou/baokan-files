Thanks to the outstanding spirit of the gentlemen responsible for preparing this Asian and Pacific Regions People’s Peace Conference, countries in the Asian and Pacific regions were able to present their opinions on the main agenda at the plenary session. The Pacific Ocean unites us, but the forces of war want to turn it into the burial ground for the supreme aspirations of us, the people, for peace.

Those enduring the brutality of total war in the sacrificed Asian nations have contemplated all the horrific aspects of the Korean issue; we, the countries far in the rear of the Americas and isolated from the outside world, must contemplate the Korean issue as well. Entrusting the supplementary report on the Korean issue to a Latin American country is most natural, because Latin American countries like Colombia are being used by others as testing grounds to trial run a dark system preparing to be imposed on the entire Americas, as a guarantee of a source of reserves in the event of a major war.

Colombia, far on the edge of the Americas, is in a situation today similar to Spain during Franco's rebellion in Europe; such a resemblance is not small and cannot be ignored. Because of its geographical situation, its economic fragility, its low level of mass political awareness, and the existence of a hidden civil war, Colombia has become one of the best and most effective places in the whole of South America to start reviving the means of the Nazi-fascist government that can best uphold the policy of war. Almost all South American countries have bilateral military agreements with the United States, which give the U.S. government the right to order the signatory countries to send troops to Korea, and use the unfortunate precedent of Colombia sending troops to Korea as a basis for this request. The current sad plight of Colombia, and the resulting domestic and international horrors, will be re-enacted throughout South America.

Today, Colombia is being used as an example to prove that war policies can count on Latin American support. The people of Colombia have to endure the humiliation and sorrow of watching their peace-loving peasant compatriots being dragged from their fields to the Korean battlefield, to attack a distant country like aggressors, a country that has never provoked us, a country we are unfamiliar with, a country that has been dedicated to defending its freedom for centuries.

The tradition of the Korean people is to bravely resist invaders attempting to seize their independence, while Colombia, apart from the arduous struggle for liberation from Spanish tyranny in the early nineteenth century, has no bellicose tradition. We grew up in an environment of independence, with a strong passion for freedom. The views of those who created our nation are based on the principle of respecting the rights of others. They are always willing to solve problems with reason rather than the use of force, and always want to reach a level of political sophistication that subordinates partisan feelings, ambitions, and contradictions to the autonomous will of the people. Therefore, there is nothing in our history that would make us overnight accomplices in military intervention in a country far from our own; nor could anything in the future make us oppose a nation that, like us, has suffered under foreign yokes, a nation that today is pointing out a glorious path for those who are beginning to extricate themselves from the vicious nightmare of colonialism.

If anything can bring us closer to Korea, it is that we share a common past, a relationship through blood ties, if the original peoples who migrated to the Americas really came from those groups of Asians who migrated from the floating islands mentioned in legends, and the mysterious symbols and scripts used in some former cultures of Colombia also suggest that they have a common origin with the most ancient cultures of the Far East.

The appearance of Colombian soldiers on the Korean battlefield, and the fact that war-mongers still want to have Latin American armies participate universally in this abominable adventure soon, is morally, politically, socially, and economically inexplicable and indefensible. This fact makes it our responsibility, and makes it necessary for you, to study the situation in Colombia in considerable detail. The situation in Colombia can be summarized as follows:

Today our people are embroiled in two wars—one internal and one international—both of which were launched by our government in an autocratic Nazi-Falangist manner. This government intends to gain U.S. support for its policy of bloody repression of the people by sending Colombian troops to Korea.

Delegates, we ourselves are facing a most filthy agreement, one of the most disgusting covenants in the historical records of modern times: that is, to exchange people for money and weapons, so that Colombia is reduced to a land of poverty and suffering. Our blood is stained on the hands of the dictators who oppress us; it is also stained on the hands of the fellows at the State Department, who supply weapons to deal with the people of Colombia, and guarantee to conceal the crimes of genocide, which so far only Hitler's Germany has carried out on a large scale, so that people do not know about them.

A brief account of the facts is enough to illustrate this strange situation.

In 1946, as a result of the division of progressive forces, a group of minorities with Falangist tendencies seized power in Colombia. This victory was precarious because the opposition still controlled Congress and other mass organizations. Then, the government systematically, with a set of policies formulated for a specific purpose, began a campaign of terror to eliminate the leading cadres of the opposition and undermine its electoral institutions. Using tactics carefully copied from Hitlerism and Falangism, they extended their power into those areas that were economically weaker and culturally more backward, intimidating opponents of the current regime. From the end of 1946 to the beginning of 1948, the police assassinated about fifteen thousand citizens. In this way, they seized the peasants' land, killed their families, burned their houses, destroyed their food, and forced them to migrate in large numbers to the borders and cities of Colombia.

But the government's position remained very unstable. The opposition forces united around a prestigious leader, winning two consecutive general election victories, thereby regaining the majority and expanding its strength. This emerging force, moving towards regaining power democratically, was cut short by the assassination of this popular leader in the capital of the republic on April 9, 1948. The whole world knows what happened in Colombia that day. The governments of Bogotá and Washington colluded to blame it on communist sabotage, in an attempt to cover up the fact that thousands of people had been killed before that day.

This policy of terror was later extended to the whole country. At the same time, they concealed it with ingenuity and meticulousness. The whole world knows this fact: this crime was only beneficial to the Falangist forces, because the comrades-in-arms of the assassinated leader gave the Falangists a lot of trouble.

The suppression of April 9, which cost the lives of thousands of Colombians, did not end the government's atrocities. The Lidice incident, which shocked the world during the days of Nazi terror, was re-enacted several times in Colombia. Towns with one or two thousand people were completely destroyed, and atrocities such as rape, torture, looting, and mass shootings spread rapidly. At the time accurately predicted by the strategists of the Nazi-Falangist group, this atrocity was extended to the Congress. Right inside the Congress, a representative was assassinated by supporters of the government, and another very prominent politician was seriously injured.

The atmosphere needed to close Congress, enforce press censorship, and infringe upon human rights and trade union rights had been created. When people write the history of these terrible years, the whole world will be horrified to see the evil consequences of the barbaric tragedy produced by the seeds sown by Nazi-Falangists in Colombia.

Following these events and their shameful consequences, we have entered the present day. Less than a month ago, before the delegates from Colombia attending this peace conference had set off, the house of former President Alfonso López was ransacked and burned by the political police. The house of this opposition leader, and another newspaper of the same nature, occupied by the most widely circulated newspaper in Colombia, run by another former president of the republic, Mr. Eduardo Santos, suffered the same fate. The positions of these figures and newspapers are far from revolutionary. They are commonly regarded as similar to democratic newspapers in North America.

The moral people responsible for these scandalous acts have a resume that is very clear to the State Department in Washington. Since 1936, when they were still an opposition party, they adopted Hitler's method of seizing power. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, they declared their support for Franco. During World War II, they sided with the Axis powers, letting everyone know that it made no difference to them whether the Panama Canal was in the hands of the United States or Japan. It was the State Department in Washington itself that would put their names on the North American blacklist. However, today we see that it is this Washington State Department that has become the main supporter of the Colombian dictatorship.

How could this be possible?

To promote their work, the dictators of our country felt it necessary to keep world opinion ignorant of their crimes, or to know only some fragments and deliberately fabricated lies. Moreover, they needed loans and frequent, rapid arms assistance, and technical support for their policies and armies trained in party ideology. In exchange for those weapons, that assistance and cooperation, what could these enemies of yesterday, these "blacklisted" figures, this Axis Fifth Column, pay in a strategically important place like Colombia?

General MacArthur's fait accompli in Korea gave the Colombian dictatorship an opportunity to conclude an extremely vicious treaty with the U.S. State Department. In order to collude with the State Department, in order to exchange the silence of American news agencies, in order to exchange the arms needed to suppress the rising resistance of Colombians demanding freedom, the dictatorship hastily agreed to and dispatched Colombian troops to Korea. According to the constitution, the dispatch of armed forces abroad requires the approval of Congress. Disregarding this provision, violating the common will of the Colombian people, the dictatorship arbitrarily incorporated soldiers and sailors from our armed forces into the expeditionary force sent to Korea.

Undoubtedly, Washington hopes that other Latin American countries will follow the unfortunate example of the Colombian dictatorship. This assumption of the State Department proved to be futile. However, the Bogotá government, not content with undermining the constitution of the republic and violating the peaceful sentiments of our people, hastily agreed to give more rewards to those who supplied it with weapons to carry out domestic terror, and to ensure that the news agencies remain silent about its crimes. In public construction projects, they are continuing to replace Colombian contractors and technicians with American capitalists and professionals, thus returning to the situation that once existed in the past. In 1950, when the patent concession of the Colombian Tropical Oil Company—a subsidiary of Mobil Oil—expired, the main oil fields in Colombia should have automatically belonged to the state. This was a day that Colombia had longed for for many years, a decisive stage in its struggle for economic independence. However, the dictatorship, tolerant and generous to its criminal partners, made a mockery of these national hopes: it signed a contract, using a new name, to lease the main departments of this enterprise indefinitely to the former lessees, calling it the exclusive right to refine and distribute oil. It appears to be a state-owned enterprise, but in reality, it is controlled by the same Mobil Oil branch.

This vicious collusion between the Bogotá dictatorial government and the Washington government has reached a ridiculous degree, a behavior despised by every civilized country, and the Colombian people will one day settle accounts for this. When the United Nations Commission on Human Rights held a meeting in Havana in 1949, the representative of the Colombian dictatorial government was elected chairman of this solemn conference. The representative of this government, which deprives people of their rights, arbitrarily murders the lives of humiliated citizens, robs their property, and damages their reputation, was actually given the highest honor in a conference aimed at defending all the rights that have been barbarously destroyed in Colombia. Turning through the entire history of mankind, one cannot find a more despicable and ridiculous absurdity. This is the seal of approval that the U.S. State Department has stamped on the treaty it has signed with the dictatorial regime, which is currently re-enacting the terrible collusion of Franco and Hitler in the Americas, and is rapidly sending troops to Korea, which the U.S. State Department wants to use as bait to lure the rest of Latin America.

The tyrannical behavior of the Syngman Rhee-like figures in Colombia has led people across the country to organize guerrilla forces by agreement, as a last resort to defend themselves. The American news agencies, according to the treaty we have denounced above, call these guerrillas bandits. For three years, these guerrillas have been carrying out an increasingly strong resistance to the government's oppressive behavior. Therefore, due to the evil and fatal consequences of the war policy, the situation in Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya will also begin to appear in Latin America.

The Colombian guerrillas, these simple people from the countryside, although they do not have much political awareness, are very clear about the relationship between the current civil war in Colombia and the war policy being implemented in Korea. They have declared in their own struggle program that they are in favor of peace and against sending troops to Asia. They have said: "Some people abroad are implementing war policies in the name of defending democracy. We do not yet have democracy in Colombia. At this time, it is impossible for Colombia to have domestic peace."

The greatest lesson that Colombians have learned from the Korean War is also a very beneficial lesson for other Latin American countries that have been forced to send troops to Asia according to military agreements forced by Washington. This lesson is given to us by our unfortunate compatriots; when they returned from the Korean front, some were injured, some were disabled, and some, disillusioned, recounted how they had personally witnessed the heroic resistance of the North Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and how they realized that the slogan of "fighting for freedom and democracy" shouted by the troops under American command was nothing but a pack of lies. In order to pay the highest respect to the Peace Conference of the Peoples of Asia and the Pacific Region, the Colombian delegation has specially brought a statement from a group of veterans of the Korean War. In this statement, they demanded an end to this absurd and criminal war and called for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact. After simply listing these facts that have occurred in our country in recent years, the Colombian delegation hopes that it will be sufficient to illustrate the inside story of the conspiracy that allowed Colombian soldiers to be sent to the Korean front. The majority of public opinion in our country not only opposes and hates this military expedition, but also angrily condemns and deeply opposes the use of bacteriological and chemical weapons against peaceful residents, and the physical and mental persecution of prisoners of war. The US government bears great responsibility for all these crimes.

The rest of Latin America, because their situation is not as unfavorable as Colombia's, has so far succeeded in preventing the dispatch of expeditionary forces to Korea. The President of Guatemala resolutely refused to send his country's soldiers away from the borders of his country to die in an unwarranted war of intervention; the Mexican government, under the pressure of the mass movement against armed intervention in Korea, cautiously postponed the initial discussion on military agreements; the Argentine government had to give in to the will of the people, which was manifested in repeated strikes by workers and a popular vote signed by three million people; the powerful movement of peace fighters in Brazil twice rejected the obligations undertaken by the government; the national police of Costa Rica went on strike as soon as the possibility of participating in the Korean War was announced; the peace fighters of Chile thwarted the government's attempt to implement the State Department's mandatory order - all this shows that the peoples of Latin American countries refuse to participate in what they consider to be an unjust war, and they see that if this war expands, it will endanger their own independence. But despite this, due to the bilateral agreements recently signed, they may still be drawn into the adventure that has caused Colombia to suffer tragic consequences in the future. We must urgently ask them to remain vigilant and redouble their efforts for peace.

The arrival of the esteemed American delegation is an invaluable contribution to the success of our work. They should know and should tell the American people about the facts we have denounced. As Ms. Soong Ching Ling said, American public opinion must realize that many atrocities are being carried out in its name, the honor of this great nation is being unnecessarily damaged, and its power can force its government to adopt peaceful policies.

We believe that one of the fundamental tasks of this conference of the peoples of Asia and the Pacific Region is to take all measures to ensure that the great people of Lincoln and Jefferson can decisively express their opposition to the war, because this war is being waged without taking into account their wishes and defending their true interests, but rather gambling with their fate. The will of the American people can and must be won over to work for peace. Broadly speaking, especially for peace fighters in Latin America, this means eradicating many erroneous and harmful remnants. While we persist in the struggle for national independence, we must clearly state that the peace struggle in the Americas is by no means against the United States. We know how to distinguish between the American people and those who are actually responsible for the heinous crimes committed in Asia and the Americas. The Colombian delegation has to emphasize this point in particular, because its own tragic example is a warning. No honest person would attribute the responsibility for the Colombian flag being disgraced in the war of aggression against Korea to the Colombian people. Similarly, we peace fighters around the world should enable the American people to remedy the mistakes that the war-mongers have placed on them, and to relieve them of the responsibility that the war-mongers have placed on them.

Delegates, the Colombian people, who have been engaged in a civil war against their own will and forced to participate in an international war, hope that you and the millions of people you represent will immediately and effectively cooperate with their forces. These forces, in such difficult circumstances, are working to prevent the continued dispatch of soldiers to Korea, and are working to ensure that the State Department no longer supports our domestic dictatorial regime, which is full of crimes and does not deserve support.

    哥伦比亚代表团团长库艾拉
    关于朝鲜问题的补充报告
    由于负责这次亚洲及太平洋区域人民的和平会议筹备工作的各位先生的卓越的精神，亚洲及太平洋区域各国，得在全体会议上对主要的议程提出它们的意见。太平洋把我们联合起来，而战争的力量竟想把太平洋变为我们这些人民争取和平的无尚崇高的愿望的葬身之地。
    那些在被牺牲的亚洲国家内正在忍受全面战争的残暴手段的人们，已经考虑了朝鲜问题的各方面的恐怖情状；我们这些远在美洲后方和外界隔离的国家，也必须同样考虑朝鲜问题。把关于朝鲜问题的补充报告付托给一个拉丁美洲的国家是最自然的事，因为像哥伦比亚这样的拉丁美洲国家正被他人用作实验场所，来试行一种准备强加于整个美洲的黑暗制度，作为一旦大战爆发时后备军来源的保证。
    远在美洲边缘的哥伦比亚今天的情形，与当年欧洲佛朗哥叛变时的西班牙相似，类似的情形不算小而且是不可忽视的。由于它的地理形势，由于经济上的脆弱，由于群众的政治觉悟不高，由于存在着隐蔽的内战，哥伦比亚便成为在整个南美洲说来着手复活最能坚持战争政策的纳粹法西斯政府手段的一个最好的和最有效果的一个地方。差不多所有南美洲国家都和美国订有双边军事协定，这些协定允许美国政府有权命令各签约国派遣军队到朝鲜去，并以哥伦比亚派遣军队到朝鲜去的不幸的先例，作为这种要求的根据。哥伦比亚当前的可悲处境，及其由此而生的国内和国际的恐怖状况，就将重演于南美洲各地。
    如今，哥伦比亚被用来证明战争政策可以指望得到拉丁美洲的支持的实例。哥伦比亚的人民不得不忍受侮辱和悲痛，眼看爱好和平的农民同胞从他们的田地里被拉到朝鲜战场，像侵略者一样地去攻击一个辽远的国家，一个从未向我们挑衅的、我们所不熟悉的、百年来致力于保卫它的自由的国家。
    朝鲜人民的传统是对企图夺取他们的独立的侵略者作英勇的抵抗，而哥伦比亚却除去在十九世纪初期进行从西班牙的独裁统治下求解放的艰苦斗争外，并没有任何好战的传统。我们生长在独立的环境中，有着强烈的要求自由的热情，那些创造我们国家的人的观点是建筑在尊重别人的权利的原则上的，他们总是情愿以理性而不以使用武力来解决问题，总是想达到一个政治修养的水平，使他们把党派的情感、野心和矛盾服从于人民的自主的意志。因此，在我们的历史上没有任何东西会使我们一夜工夫就变成对一个离我们自己国家很远的国家去进行军事干涉的同谋者；将来也不可能有任何事情会使我们去反对一个和我们一样，曾在外国桎梏下受难的民族，这个民族今天正给那些开始要从恶毒的殖民主义噩梦中自拔出来的民族指出了一条光辉的道路。
    假如有什么能使我们同朝鲜靠拢的话，那就是我们有着共同的过去，有过主亲的关系，如果移居美洲的原始人们真是从那些传说中提到的忽沉忽浮的岛屿上迁来的亚洲的集团，而哥伦比亚以前的一些文化所用的神秘的符号文字，也暗示它们与最古代远东的那些文化有共同的来源。
    哥伦比亚的兵士出现在朝鲜的战场上，以及战争贩子还想要使拉丁美洲的军队在最近普遍地参加这个可恶的冒险，这从道德、政治、社会和经济上来讲都是无法说明和申辩的事情。这个事实使我们有责任，并使你们有必要来相当详细地研究哥伦比亚的情况。哥伦比亚的情况总括起来可以这样来说：
    今天我们人民被卷入了两个战争——一个是内部的，一个是国际的——这两个战争都是我国政府以一种专制的纳粹——长枪党的方式发动起来的，这个政府打算以派遣哥伦比亚军队到朝鲜去，来换得美国对它血腥镇压人民的政策的支持。
    各位代表们，我们自己正面对着一个最污秽的协议，一个在现代的历史记载上最恶心的公约：那就是以人来换得金钱和武器，使哥伦比亚沦为穷困和苦难之邦。我们的血沾染在压迫我们的独裁者手上；也沾染在国务院的家伙们手上，国务院供给武器来对付哥伦比亚的人民，并且保证把那迄今只有希特勒德国才大规模实行过的绝灭种族的罪行掩蔽起来不让人们知道。
    一篇简短的事实的叙述就足够说明这种怪现状了。
    一九四六年，由于进步力量分裂的结果，一个有长枪党倾向的少数人的集团在哥伦比亚掌握了政权。这个胜利是不稳固的，因为反对派的势力还控制着国会及其他群众团体。然后，政府有系统地，用一套为达到一定目的而制定的政策，开始进行恐怖活动，以消灭反对派的领导干部，并破坏它的选举机构。他们用细心地从希特勒主义和长枪党那里抄袭来的战术，把力量深入到那些经济上较弱文化上较落后的地区，恐吓现政权的反对者。从一九四六年底到一九四八年初，警察暗杀了约一万五千个公民。就用这种方式，他们夺去了农民的土地，杀害他们的家属，烧毁他们的房屋，毁坏他们的粮食，并强迫他们大批迁移到哥伦比亚的边界和城市中去。
    但是政府的地位仍然很不稳固。反对势力团结在一个声望卓著的领袖周围，接连赢得了两次大选的胜利，从而重新取得多数并且扩大了它的力量。这一种走向以民主的方式再度夺取政权的新兴力量由于一九四八年四月九日这位众望所归的领袖在共和国的首都被刺杀而遭到夭折。全世界都知道那一天在哥伦比亚发生了什么事，波哥大和华盛顿两个政府串通，推委说这是由于共产党的破坏，以企图掩盖在那一天以前有成千的人民被杀害的事实。
    这一恐怖政策，后来更被扩大到全国。同时，他们以巧妙与细致的手法掩盖起来了。全世界都知道这个事实：这个罪行只是对长枪党势力有利。因为被暗杀的这位领袖的战友们给长枪党许多麻烦。
    四月九日的镇压，付出了成千哥伦比亚人民的生命，并没有结束政府的暴行，在纳粹恐怖的日子里，全世界深为震动的利台斯事件，好几次在哥伦比亚重演。有一二千人的城镇整个被毁灭、强奸、酷刑、劫掠和集体枪杀等暴行迅速地蔓延。在纳粹—长枪党集团的战略家们准确预测的时间里，这个暴行被扩展到国会之内。就在国会里面，一个代表被政府的拥护者所刺杀了，还有一个非常卓越的政治家负了重伤。
    封闭国会，强制新闻检查和侵犯人权与工会的权益所需要的空气已经制造出来了。当人们写下这些可怕岁月的历史时，全世界将会惊怖地看到由于纳粹——长枪党分子在哥伦比亚播下的种子所产生的野蛮的悲剧的恶果。
    接着这些事件及其可耻的恶果之后，我们就进入了目前的时日。不到一个月以前，在哥伦比亚出席这个和平会议的代表还没有出发之前，前总统阿丰琐·罗伯兹的房子被政治警察所洗劫并且烧毁。另一个前共和国总统艾杜阿多·圣托斯先生所办的在哥伦比亚销路最广的报纸所占用的这个反对党领袖的房子和另一家同样性质的报纸也遭到同样的命运。上述的这些人物和报纸的立场，远不是革命的立场，普通只认为与北美的民主报纸相似。
    这些可耻行为的道义负责人有着为华盛顿的国务院所非常清楚的履历。自从一九三六年以来，当他们还是一个反对党的时候，他们就采用了希特勒夺取政权的办法。当西班牙内战的时候，他们宣布站在佛朗哥方面。在第二次世界大战中，他们倒向轴心方面，让大家都知道吧，对他们来说，巴拿马运河到底是在美国手中或是在日本手中，是毫无关系的。正是华盛顿的国务院自己，就会把他们的名字列在北美黑名单上。可是，今天我们看到正是这个华盛顿国务院已经成为哥伦比亚独裁政治的主要支持者了。
    这种情形怎么可能呢？
    为了推动他们的工作，我国的独裁者感到有必要不让世界舆论知道他们的罪行，或者仅仅知道其中的一些零星片断和故意捏造出来的一套假话。而且，他们需要贷款和经常、迅速的武器援助，需要对于他们政策的技术支援和受过党义训练的军队。为了换取那些武器、那些助力和合作、这些昨天的敌人、这些“黑名单”上的人物、这个轴心第五纵队，像在哥伦比亚这样具有战略重要性的地方，他们能够付出什么呢？
    麦克阿瑟将军在朝鲜的既成事实给予了哥伦比亚独裁政权以一个机会，和美国国务院缔结一项极凶恶的条约。为了与国务院勾结，为了换取美国通讯社的沉默，为了换取在镇压要求自由的哥伦比亚人的日益高涨的反抗中所需要的武装，独裁政权急忙答应并派遣了哥伦比亚军队到朝鲜去。根据宪法规定，派遣武装部队出国是需要获得国会的批准的。独裁政权撇开这一规定，违反哥伦比亚人的共同意志，擅自把我们武装部队的士兵和水手编入派往朝鲜的远征军。
    无疑地，华盛顿希望其他拉丁美洲国家都遵循哥伦比亚独裁政权的不幸的例子。国务院的这个设想证明是落空了，然而波哥大政府并不满足于破坏共和国宪法和违反我国人民的和平情绪，急忙答应以更多的报酬给予那些供给它以武器来施行国内恐怖、并保证通讯社对于它的罪行保持缄默的人们。在公共建设工程中，他们正继续以美国的资本家和专业人员来代替哥伦比亚的承造商和技术人员，这样便回复到过去历史上曾经出现过的情况。一九五○年，在哥伦比亚热带石油公司——美孚油公司的附属机构——专利开采权期满时，哥伦比亚各主要油田本应自动归国家所有。这是哥伦比亚多年来渴望到来的一天，也就是它在争取经济独立过程中的一个决定性的阶段。然而，对于自己的犯罪伙伴宽容大度的独裁政权，却对这些全国性的希望开了一次玩笑：它签订了一项合同，用一个新的名义，将这项企业中的主要的部门无限期地出让给以前的租借人，称之为石油精炼和分配的专营，它表面上看来好像是一个国营企业，而实际上却被同一美孚油公司分公司所控制着。
    波哥大独裁政府与华盛顿政府之间的这种恶毒的狼狈为奸的行为达到了可笑透顶的程度，这一行为是每一个文明国家所不齿，而哥伦比亚的人民总有一天要来算账的。一九四九年联合国人权委员会在哈瓦那举行会议的时候，哥伦比亚独裁政府的代表被选为这个隆重的大会的主席。这个剥夺人权，任意屠杀被屈辱了的公民的生命，抢劫他们的财产，损坏他们的名誉的政府的代表，居然在以保卫一切在哥伦比亚受到野蛮摧残的权利为目标的大会中被赋与最高的荣誉。翻遍人类的全部历史，再也找不出比这更加卑鄙可笑的怪事。这就是美国国务院在与独裁政权所签订的条约上所盖的批准的印记，而这个独裁政权目前正在美洲重演着佛朗哥和希特勒的可怕勾当，正急速派遣军队到朝鲜去，美国国务院想用这种办法作为引诱拉丁美洲其余国家的钓饵。
    哥伦比亚的李承晚之流的横暴行为，使得全国各地人民，不约而同地组织了游击队，作为保卫自己的最后手段。美国通讯社根据上面我们痛斥的条约把这些游击队称为土匪，三年来，这些游击队对于政府的压迫行为进行着日益加强的抵抗。因此，由于战争政策的毒恶的致命的结果，朝鲜，越南，寮国，高棉以及马来亚的局面也将开始在拉丁美洲出现。
    哥伦比亚的游击队，这些来自农村的朴素的人民，尽管政治上没有多少认识，但是他们对于目前哥伦比亚的内战和在朝鲜所实行的战争政策之间的关系还是认识得很清楚的。他们在自己的斗争纲领中曾经宣布赞成和平，反对向亚洲遣送军队，他们曾经说过：“国外还有人在假借保卫民主的名义实行战争政策，在哥伦比亚我们还没有民主，在这种时候，哥伦比亚是不可能有国内的和平的。”
    哥伦比亚人从朝鲜战争得到的最大教训，对于那些被强迫按照华盛顿所强制成立的军事协定向亚洲遣送军队的其他拉丁美洲国家，也是一个非常有益的教训。这个教训是我们那些遭受不幸的同胞给我们的；当他们从朝鲜前线回来的时候，有的受了伤，有的残废了，灰心失望地述说了他们如何亲眼看到北朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军英勇的抵抗，如何认识了在美国指挥下的军队中所喊叫的“为自由、为民主而斗争”的口号不过是一派谎言。为了向亚洲及太平洋区域的人民的和平会议表示崇高的敬意，哥伦比亚代表团特别带来了朝鲜战争退伍军人团体的一个声明书。在这个声明书上，他们要求停止这个荒谬的罪恶战争，并且要求缔结五大国和平公约。哥伦比亚代表团希望在简单地列举了最近几年在我们国家内所发生的这些事实之后，就足以说明那种允许派遣哥伦比亚士兵赴朝鲜前线的阴谋的内幕。我们国家大多数的舆论，不但反对和痛恨这个军事远征，而且愤怒地谴责，深切地反对向和平居民使用细菌武器和化学武器，反对对战俘施行肉体上的和精神上的迫害。而这一切罪行美国政府都要负重大的责任。
    拉丁美洲其余各国，因为处境不像哥伦比亚那样不利，到目前为止成功地阻止了派遣远征军去朝鲜。危地马拉总统断然拒绝派遣他的国家的兵士远离本国的边疆到一个没有理由的干涉战争中去送死；墨西哥政府，在人民群众反对武装干涉朝鲜的运动压力下，以谨慎的方式延期举行关于军事公约的初步讨论；阿根廷政府不得不对人民的意愿让步，人民的意愿表现在工人的屡次罢工和获得三百万人签名的民意投票上面；巴西和平战士的有力的运动，二次拒绝了政府所承担的义务；哥斯达黎加的国家警察一听到宣布有可能参加朝鲜战争时，就举行了罢勤；智利和平战士阻碍了政府实行国务院强制命令的企图——这一切表明了拉丁美洲的各国人民拒绝参加他们认为非正义的战争，他们看到：这个战争如果扩大，必将危及他们自己的独立。但是尽管如此，由于最近签订的双边公约，他们在将来仍有可能被卷入使哥伦比亚遭到悲惨后果的冒险中去。我们必须迫切地请他们保持警惕，并加倍努力争取和平。
    可敬的美国代表团的到来对我们的工作的胜利是一个难以估价的贡献，他们应该知道，也应该把我们所指斥的事实告诉美国人民。宋庆龄女士说得好，美国的舆论必须认识到有许多暴行是假借它的名义而进行的，这个伟大民族的荣誉受到无谓的损害，而它的力量是可以迫使它的政府采取和平政策的。
    我们认为：亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民这次大会的基本任务之一，就是采取一切措施确保林肯和杰斐逊的伟大的人民能够决定地表示他们反对战争的意见，因为这个战争在进行时没有考虑到他们的愿望和保卫他们的真正利益，而是拿他们的命运来作赌注。美国人民的意志是能够也必须争取过来为和平而努力的。扩大来看，特别对拉丁美洲的和平战士来说，这意味着要肃清许多错误和有害的残余。我们一面坚持争取民族独立的斗争，一方面我们又必须明确地表示美洲的和平斗争绝对不是反对美国，我们知道怎样分清美国人民和对于在亚洲和美洲所犯的滔天罪行实际上应该负责的那些人。哥伦比亚代表团在这点上不得不特别强调，因为它自己悲痛的例子就是一个警告。没有一个正直的人会把哥伦比亚国旗在侵略朝鲜战争中受到污辱的责任归诸哥伦比亚人民。同样，我们全世界的和平战士应该使美国人民能够补救战争贩子推在他们身上的错误，解脱战争贩子推在他们身上的责任。
    各位代表，违背了他们自己的意志而从事内战和被迫参加国际战争的哥伦比亚人民希望你们和你们所代表的千百万人民立刻并有效地和他们的力量合作。这种力量在这样艰苦的环境下正在努力阻止继续派遣兵士到朝鲜去，正在努力使得国务院不再支持罪恶累累、不值得支持的我们国内独裁政权。
