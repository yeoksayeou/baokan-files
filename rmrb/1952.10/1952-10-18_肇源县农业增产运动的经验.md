Experiences in the Agricultural Production Increase Campaign in Zhaoyuan County
Ren Guodong, Secretary of the Zhaoyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Zhaoyuan County has 118,000 hectares of arable land. The county's production increase plan for this spring requires a grain output of 600,000 shi (approximately 60,000 metric tons), averaging nearly 6 shi of grain per hectare. This plan was formulated based on the general requirement of increasing grain production by 5 dou (approximately 50 kg) per hectare compared to last year. At the time, the leadership felt uncertain about achieving this plan, and when it was initially implemented among the masses, it encountered many resistant ideas. For example, when cadres helped groups to set plans, some farmers said, "With land like ours, yielding five or six shi of grain per hectare is already backbreaking." "Even if we set a plan, it's hard to get a good harvest if the heavens don't send rain." Some groups, although having set plans, lacked confidence in completing them, saying things like, "We have to be careful"; some model laborers, after setting production increase plans, dared not tell others, fearing being called "braggarts." Therefore, the competition campaign at this stage was limited to meetings, among cadres, and among model laborers; by April 20th, only 1% of the mutual aid teams in the county had set plans and participated in the competition.

Later, after conducting in-depth self-education on comparing the old and new paths among the masses; after leading cadres and farmers jointly inspected and studied the possibilities for increasing production on local land, gradually implementing the production increase methods of equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection; and continuously improving mutual aid teams during the implementation of the new production increase methods; and after regularly checking, evaluating, and launching red banner competition campaigns by season, entering the second plowing and weeding period, the mass production increase movement greatly developed. This is reflected in: the area of land creating new records increased from 912 hectares to 9,126 hectares, and the number of villages creating new records increased from 16 to 30. 100% of the land creating new records received topdressing fertilizer, some receiving it three times. For villages and groups creating new records, 70% to 80% of the cultivated land was topdressed, and in some villages and groups, it reached 100%. The area of cultivated land in the county that received topdressing fertilizer reached 22.5%, and the area of millet, soybeans, sorghum, and other crops that were thinned reached 27,000 hectares, accounting for 22.9% of the total cultivated land area. The area of seedling replacement and transplanting reached 5,159 hectares. Judging from the nearly 10,000 hectares of crops that are growing well now, if there are no special disasters, it is possible to harvest an average of 15 shi of grain per hectare.

During the production increase movement, the Party's work and mass work became more active, and the role of Party members in the production movement also improved. The Peace Village in the Second District originally had a poor work foundation. Through the organization and leadership of the Party branch, 100% of the village's cultivated land implemented thinning and topdressing, making Peace Village a new record village. Mutual aid teams led by Party members in the county accounted for one-quarter of the total number of mutual aid teams that won red banner awards. At the same time, general mutual aid teams also generally improved a step further. The masses reflected, "In previous years, people used to complain a lot when it came to weeding, but this year, everyone is planning for the long term." According to statistics, during the summer weeding, 451 temporary and seasonal groups improved one to two levels, accounting for a little over 10% of the total. Women and semi-able-bodied laborers participating in the production increase movement reached 85% of the total, changing some farmers' views of underestimating women. Everywhere, one hears, "This year, we owe a lot to the women..." Even the elderly praised the role of women in production.

From the above situation, it can be seen that Zhaoyuan County's patriotic production increase movement is combined with the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the improved agricultural technology movement, and gradually developed. The entire development process of the movement is roughly as follows:

April 20th is Guyu (Grain Rain), and the sowing season is urgent, but the masses have little confidence in completing the production increase plan, and the cadres lack specific methods. Therefore, how to launch a high tide of patriotic production increase competition throughout the county was an urgent task at that time. The county party committee understood that the production increase plans of many groups basically listed the perennial yield figures, and did not think of increasing production (some even lowered the actual yield of good years to the perennial yield). The reason for this, in addition to the different ideological concerns of the farmers, was mainly that the farmers did not know how to make the land produce more grain. However, high yields in mass production have long existed. For example, in 1951, Fang Chunzhi harvested 31 shi of millet per hectare; Luo Qinglin harvested 35 shi of sorghum per hectare; Jin Shurong harvested 25 shi of corn per hectare. Their farming methods differed from those of ordinary people in that they planted, weeded, and cultivated in a timely manner and applied manure for three consecutive years. Luo Qinglin also adopted methods such as close planting and sparse thinning. Last year was relatively dry, and their land was not very good, but these high yields appeared, which attracted everyone's attention. The county party committee convened cadres in Sihetun to conduct research, collected ears of medium-yielding grain from last year and weighed them. Corn ears weighed three taels (approximately 110 grams), sorghum weighed one and a half taels (approximately 55 grams), and millet weighed three qian (approximately 11 grams). According to a calculation of 3,600 square chi (approximately 1,200 square meters) per hectare, if 80 millet plants are planted per chi, 47 shi can be harvested per hectare; if 7 sorghum plants are planted per chi, 27 shi can be harvested per hectare; if 3 corn plants are planted per chi, and calculated by single ear (in fact, some are double ears), 18 shi can be harvested per hectare. If more manure can be applied and there is sufficient rainfall, and the number of weeding and cultivation passes is increased, more grain can be harvested.

The above calculation is not high, but everyone is surprised why they only harvested a few shi of grain in the past, or a little more than ten shi at best, and never harvested so much grain. So, they further studied the reasons for the low yields in the past. They first started by studying the sowing. Everyone agreed that this was due to rough cultivation, uneven seed distribution, and frequent breaks in the rows (blank spaces). Uneven soil covering by the soil covering tool, empty spaces left by the soil compacting, stubble not completely removed, and the destruction caused by diseases and insect pests, these reasons meant that the results of hard work each year only yielded one-third of the potential. That is to say, the value of the reduction in yield per hectare each year is more than that of a horse. This greatly reminded everyone that the land can produce more grain.

Then, everyone further studied how to overcome the above shortcomings, improve farming techniques, and ensure a bumper harvest this year.

1.  The quality of seeds plays a major role in increasing yield. According to the experience of the masses, in previous years, head smut disease accounted for one-tenth or two-tenths of sorghum, and sometimes even more; similarly, one-tenth or two-tenths of millet spikes were shriveled. This requires careful selection of seeds. For millet seeds, in addition to selecting seeds with salt water, it is also necessary to implement warm water soaking, or use copper sulfate or 2% distilled spirits to mix the seeds to prevent head smut disease. Solving this problem can protect the seedlings and increase production by two-tenths or three-tenths. As the farmers' saying goes, "Choosing good seeds for planting is like having two more rows of land." It can be seen that farmers have such experience.

2.  Improve sowing methods to eliminate the phenomenon of uneven seed distribution. Because the old farming method was very rough, after the small seedlings emerged, some rows were broken (blank spaces), and some were as thick as a horse's mane. The reason for this is related to seeding, soil covering, soil compacting, etc. First of all, because the ditch opened by the plow is triangular, the bottom of the ditch is very narrow, and when the soil covering tool is used, the soil is squeezed from both sides, making the seeds at the bottom of the ditch even more concentrated. This not only makes the seedling row narrow, but also very thick, causing the seeds to form clumps. According to the inspection, in a seedling row that is one chi (approximately 33 cm) long and one cun (approximately 3 cm) wide, there are 140 to 150 millet plants. Some ears grow very small, and some cannot grow at all. Therefore, when plowing, a half-brick, or a horse's head bone, or two wooden sticks tied behind the "heart" of the plow should be placed after the plowing tool, and a horizontal stick should be tied to the lower end of the sticks to drag a flat bottom groove, so that the bottom sits more soil, the seedling row is wide, and the seeds are evenly scattered at the same time.

Secondly, poor seeding is also one of the reasons for broken rows and missing seedlings. To seed well, in addition to being careful when seeding, it is also necessary to widen the seeding device to form a flat surface. It is best to make a triangular shape with a wooden board to make it as wide as the ridge, and insert wooden strips on both sides to prevent seed leakage. In addition, use nails to penetrate the board to form equidistant serrations, and the density of the nails can be determined according to different seeds. When seeding, the seeds are scattered evenly from both sides of the equidistant small nails.

Again, soil covering and soil compacting are also important for protecting seedlings and increasing production. The soil covering tool used by farmers is generally in the shape of an ox, and the soil is uneven. Therefore, when soil covering, it often drags heaps and the soil covering thickness is uneven. The thick places cannot grow out, and the thin places encounter spring dryness and the seeds dry out or are eaten by birds, which easily leads to broken rows and missing seedlings. In addition, when soil compacting, there are generally about two cun (approximately 6 cm) of space between the front and rear feet that are not stepped on, the seeds are prone to dryness, and the seeds under the stubble are difficult to grow if the stubble is not removed. This is also an important reason for broken rows and missing seedlings. In order to make up for this loss, the soil covering tool in the shape of an ox can be changed to a board soil covering tool to make the soil cover evenly, but the floating soil in the middle is thick. A side soil covering tool should be added to the plow to drag the stubble and make it slide into the ridge ditch. Soil compacting is best changed to egg-shaped rollers, and the middle of the rollers is changed to a flat shape. The ridges can be pressed by placing the rollers on a sled frame, and can be placed between the two hind legs of the plow so as not to pull away the seeds.

Finally, incomplete removal of stubble is harmful to production increase. It will make the seeds not covered tightly, affecting seed germination and growth, and it is also one of the sources of insect pests. Therefore, finding ways to clean up the stubble before planting is a very important factor in increasing production.

3.  Improve weeding and cultivation methods and implement thinning. Farmers are accustomed to "leaving a row in the middle whether there are seedlings or not," or "leaving thick in sparse places, and sparse in thick places," turning the original primitive seedling row of about three cun (approximately 10 cm) into a little more than one cun (approximately 3 cm) wide. The purpose is to provide ventilation, but the method of thinning at equal intervals is not adopted to allow air to circulate. As a result, crops only occupy one-tenth of the land area, greatly wasting land fertility, which is the biggest reason for reduced production. Therefore, the most important thing in the first weeding is to determine how many seedlings to keep, and the phenomenon of weeding "sprouts" in the past should be corrected to prevent seedling strangulation. When weeding two or three times, be careful. If there is grass at the seedling roots, do not use a hoe to cut it, but remove it by hand to avoid cutting off the seedlings. When cultivating, use a plough with a chisel or a three-way plough (with wings), and tie a bundle of grass to the neck of the plough to fertilize the soil, so that the top of the ridge forms a square, which has a certain effect on preserving the roots, resisting drought, and resisting waterlogging. This soil fertilization method does not affect deep cultivation, it just reduces the slope of the ridge, and compared with the old soil fertilization method, it has more advantages than disadvantages.

After such research, the cultivation methods of wide sowing, equal spacing, thinning, and seedling protection were determined.

The wide sowing, equal spacing, thinning, and seedling protection method must be determined according to the width of the local ridge bottom and different crops. The scale of wide sowing is based on the degree to which proper soil fertilization can be obtained on the basis of the original cultivation. Equal spacing thinning must be treated differently according to soil quality. The single-plant spacing of various crops should be: on fertile black soil with abundant humus, sorghum must be kept at five cun (approximately 17 cm), corn at one chi and three cun (approximately 43 cm), soybeans at four cun (approximately 13 cm), and millet should be widely sown at 3.6 cun (approximately 12 cm) to 4.5 cun (approximately 15 cm), leaving two rows of seedlings, thinned into dog-bite patterns, with a plant spacing of 1.5 cun (approximately 5 cm) (within the same row) and 2.4 cun (approximately 8 cm) (between two rows); on barren land (such as sandy soil, yellow soil), sorghum must be kept at 6 to 7 cun (approximately 20 to 23 cm), corn at more than 1.5 chi (approximately 50 cm), and soybeans at 2.5 to 3 cun (approximately 8 to 10 cm). While widening the sowing area, attention must be paid to providing a large amount of fertilizer required by crops. In addition to applying accumulated manure, topdressing fertilizer must be applied in a timely manner.

In order to implement this new production increase method, education was repeatedly carried out among the masses. After publicizing this production increase method to the masses at the beginning of the spring plowing, the farmers felt surprised and skeptical. Some said, "Measuring with eggshells can produce so much grain. I have never heard of it in my lifetime of farming." In order to break the ideological concerns of the masses, we used many examples of high yields (such examples exist in almost every village) to educate the farmers. For example, Yang Ertoutou of Zhiyuan Village in the Twelfth District opened 1.2 mu (small mu) of wasteland in 1943 and harvested 50 shi and 4 dou of millet; Zhang Sen of Yangliu Village harvested 1.6 shi of wild millet from half a mu. Their main experiences were wide sowing, thinning, and ensuring full seedlings. During the organization of farmer discussions, some farmers proved these facts; some secretly planned to try it out; some regretted saying, "This method was proposed too late, my land is almost sown." Some farmers said, "The Communist Party is really great, they have thought of things we never thought of." During the sowing season, we widely organized cadres and farmers to inspect the fields, greatly promoting the improvement of sowing work. Many masses established various technical requirements for sowing within the groups, and generally carried out seed disinfection. In the Second District alone, more than 800 jin (approximately 400 kg) of distilled spirits were used to mix seeds to eliminate head smut disease.

After the sowing was completed, the county launched a technical competition, mainly to check seed treatment, sowing operation methods, etc., and studied how to implement summer weeding thinning, seedling protection, and topdressing work. At the same time, this was used as content to train key members of the production team. After the competition, the masses' enthusiasm for increasing production was further increased. However, during the first weeding stage in the summer weeding season, it was found that some farmers had the idea of "cherishing seedlings" when implementing equal spacing thinning, and doubted whether they could really achieve the planned yield, fearing that it would cost too much labor. In order to eliminate these ideological obstacles in a timely manner, the leadership widely organized the masses to go to the fields of advanced farmers to actually observe the distance between the seedlings, let the masses calculate the yield themselves, and organized more than 3,000 people to visit the county demonstration farm, which further strengthened the farmers' determination to implement the new production increase method. In addition, the situation of weeding and injuring seedlings was constantly checked to educate farmers. In the patriotic production increase movement, the county party committee decided to strengthen the work of the party branch, calling on party members and members of the Communist Youth League to actively learn production increase techniques and lead the masses.

After the above series of work, the number of villages planning to create new records almost doubled, and the output increased by one to two times compared to the original plan, and the new record land increased to nearly ten times. The masses' understanding of this production increase method has also improved. On this basis, the leadership launched more than 6,800 people to transplant seedlings on 5,159 hectares of land.

Due to the gradual promotion of this new production increase method, it is required that the form of production organization adapt to the development of this movement. Therefore, it is proposed that in the Red Banner Competition, not only should production increase technology be carefully studied, but also women and semi-able-bodied laborers should be mobilized to participate in production, which requires specific solutions to the difficulties of women participating in production. For example, the Third District organized elderly women to help young and middle-aged women who went to the fields to cook and take care of children, and various places generally organized key female members to learn thinning technology on the spot. Some places sent experienced old farmers to serve as technical instructors for women's teams. In this way, the men, women, old, and young in the rural areas were organized into the production increase movement to encourage and check each other to ensure the realization of the production increase plan.

Through this year's production increase movement, we deeply realized that as long as we closely connect with the masses and conduct in-depth and specific investigations and studies, we can continuously improve our work and obtain the knowledge we need. The method of increasing production by wide sowing, equal spacing, thinning, and seedling protection was researched and discovered from the experience of high yields of local farmers this year and in the past. These experiences were also adopted in production in the past, but they were not valued. This year's production increase movement vividly educated us that in future work, we should be more敏锐 (Minrui - quick-witted, sharp) to observe new things, summarize the experiences of the masses, and make good use of the existing experiences to promote our cause to move forward continuously.

    肇源县农业增产运动的经验
    中共肇源县委书记    任国栋
    肇源县有十一万八千垧耕地，今春所订的全县增产计划要求产粮六十万石，平均每垧产粮将近六石。这个计划是按照每垧地比去年增产五斗粮的一般要求制订的。当时领导方面对实现这一计划曾感到把握不大，在群众中开始执行时，也碰到了许多抵抗的思想。如干部帮助小组订计划时，有的农民说：“像我们这样的地，一垧地打五、六石粮顶折腰了”“再订计划老天爷不下雨也难打粮”。有的小组虽已订出计划，但组员对完成计划的信心不大，如说：“可得搂着点”；有的劳动模范订了增产计划不敢向外说，怕别人说是“吹牛”。因此，这一时期的竞赛运动只是停留在会议上、干部间和劳动模范间；至四月二十日，全县只有百分之一的互助组订了计划参加竞赛。
    以后，经过在群众中深入地进行新旧道路对比的自我教育；经过领导干部和农民一道检查、研究本地土地增产的可能性，逐步地贯彻等距、宽播、间苗、保苗的增产办法，并在贯彻新的增产办法的过程中不断地提高互助组；又经过按季定期检查评比和开展红旗竞赛运动，进入第二遍铲趟时期，群众性的增产运动有了很大的发展。这表现在：创造新纪录的土地已由九百一十二垧增加到九千一百二十六垧，创造新纪录的村由十六个增至三十个。创造新纪录的土地百分之百地上了追肥，有的上了三遍。创造新纪录的村、组的耕地面积，施追肥的达到百分之七十至八十，部分村、组达到百分之百。全县耕地施追肥的面积达到百分之二十二点五，谷子、大豆、高粱等作物间苗的达二万七千垧，占总耕地面积百分之二十二点九。补苗移苗的面积达五千一百五十九垧。就现在近万垧发育较好的庄稼看，如无特殊灾害，平均每垧地有可能打十五石粮。
    在增产运动中，党的工作和群众工作更加活跃了，党员在生产运动中的作用也提高了。二区和平村原来工作基础不好，经过支部的组织领导，全村耕地百分之百地实行了间苗和施追肥，使和平村成为新纪录村。全县党员领导的互助组获得红旗优胜奖的占得红旗奖的互助组总数的四分之一。同时，一般互助组也普遍提高了一步。群众反映：“往年一到铲地时就打唧唧，今年都往长远打算了。”据统计，夏锄中临时组、季节组提高一级到两级的有四百五十一个，占总数的百分之十强。妇女和半劳动力参加增产运动的达到总数的百分之八十五，转变了某些农民轻视妇女的观点，到处听到的是“今年多亏了妇女……”，连老年人也赞扬妇女在生产中的作用了。
    从上述情况中可以看出，肇源县的爱国增产运动，是和互助合作运动、改进农业技术运动相结合，逐步发展起来的。整个运动发展的过程，大致是这样：
    四月二十日是谷雨，播种期已紧迫，但是群众对完成增产计划的信心不大，干部又缺乏具体办法，因此，如何在全县掀起一个爱国增产竞赛运动的高潮，是当时的紧急任务。县委了解很多小组的增产计划，基本上是罗列了常年产量数字，并没有想法增加生产（有的甚至把好年头的实际产量降低为常年产量），其原因除农民有不同的思想顾虑外，最主要的是农民不知道如何能使土地多打粮食。但群众生产中的高额产量早是存在的。例如一九五一年方纯志一垧谷子打了三十一石；罗庆林一垧高粱打了三十五石；金树荣一垧苞米打了二十五石。他们的耕作方法和一般人不同的是种、铲、趟及时，并且连上了三年粪。罗庆林还采取了密植、疏苗等办法。去年较旱，他们的土地又不是很好的，但却出现了这些高额产量，这就引起了大家的重视。县委在四合屯召集干部进行了研究，搜集去年产量中等的穗头过秤，苞米一穗粮重三两，高粱重一两半，谷子重三钱。根据每垧三千六百平方弓计算，谷子每弓如种八十棵，每垧即可收获四十七石；高粱每弓如种七棵，每垧可收二十七石；苞米每弓如种三棵，以单穗计算（实际有部分是双穗的），每垧可收十八石。如果能多上粪，雨水较足与增加铲趟遍数，那就会打更多的粮食。
    以上的算法并不高，但是大家很奇怪为什么过去只打几石粮，好的也只打十多石，而从来没有打过这样多的粮食。于是就进一步研究了过去打粮少的原因。首先从播种研究起。大家一致认为这是由于耕作粗糙、点种稀厚不匀和经常出现断条（空白地）。?地时扶拉子（一种盖土工具）盖土不匀、踩格子（是在播种后用脚把土踩实或用镇压器把土压实，使土壤和种籽密接，便于发芽）拉空、茬子未彻底除净，又常遭受病虫害的破坏，这些原因使每年辛勤劳动的结果，仅仅能收获三分之一，这就是说，每垧地每年减产的价值比一匹马还多。这就大大地提醒了大家，地是能够多打粮的。
    接着大家更进一步研究了如何克服上述缺点，改进耕作技术，保证今年获得丰产。
    一、种籽的好坏，对增加产量起着很大作用。根据群众经验，往年高粱的黑穗病要占十分之一、二，有的甚至还多些；谷穗子同样也有十分之一、二的瘪子。这就要精选籽种。如谷子种，除用盐水选种外，还必须实行温汤浸种，或者用王铜或百分之二的烧酒拌种，来防止黑穗病。把这一问题解决了，就能保住幼苗，可增产十分之二、三。农民俗语说：“种地选好种，等于土地多两垅。”可见农民有这样的经验。
    二、改进播种方法，消灭撒种稀厚不均的现象。由于旧耕作法很粗糙，小苗出土后有的断条（空白地），有的厚如马鬃，究其原因，与点种、盖土、踩格子等都有关系。首先，由于?把铧子豁的沟是三角形，沟底很窄，又加上拉子盖土时，两边一挤，使沟底的种籽更多，这样不但苗眼窄，而且非常厚，使种籽形成撮。据检查，长一尺、宽一寸多的苗眼有一百四、五十棵谷子的现象，有的穗长的很小，有的根本就长不出来。因此，?地必须在?耙撩子后边放一块半截砖，或马头骨，或用两根木棍绑在?耙“心”后边，并在棍子下端绑一横棍，使其拖成平沟底，这样，下边坐土多，苗眼宽，同时撒种均匀。
    其次，点种不好，也是造成断条、缺苗的原因之一。要点种好，除了应在点种时细心外，同时需要把点葫芦加宽，使其形成平面。最好是用木板做成三角状，使其与垅一样宽，两边镶上木条，以防止漏种，另用洋钉透过该板钉成等距离的锯齿形，钉的稀密可根据不同的种籽而确定。点种时，使种籽从等距的小钉两边往下走，撒的均匀。
    再次，扶拉子、踩格子对于保苗增产也很重要。农民使用的拉子一般都是牛样子式的，加上地里有茬子、土不渲，因此扶拉子时往往拖堆、盖土厚薄不匀，厚处长不出来，薄处遇到春干种籽即干掉或露种被鸟吃掉，这样就容易产生断空缺苗。另外，踩格子时，前后脚之间，一般都空出二寸左右地方未踩着，种籽易发干，有茬子的地方不剔去茬子就踩，使茬子下面的种籽不易长出来，也是断条缺苗的重要原因。为了弥补这一损失，可把牛样子式的拉子改变为板拉子，使土盖的均匀，但中间浮土厚，应在耲耙上加一旁拉子，一拖茬子就能使其滑到垅沟里去。踩格子最好改用鸡蛋滚子，把滚子当中改变成平面形，用爬犁架起来压垅台，可把它架在耲耙的两个后腿之间，这样不致于拉走种籽。
    最后，茬子消除的不干净，对增产为害不小。它会使种籽盖土不严，影响种籽发芽生长，同时也是发生虫灾的根源之一。因此设法在种地前把茬子弄净，是增产很重要的因素。
    三、改进铲趟方法，实行间苗。农民习惯“有苗没苗，当中留一条”，或“厚留稀，稀留厚”，使原来三寸左右的原始苗眼变成一寸多宽，目的是为了通风，而不采取等距间苗办法使空气流通，结果，作物仅占土地面积的十分之一，大大地浪费了地力，这是减产的最大原因。因此，铲头遍地最重要的是决定留苗多少，并且应该纠正过去铲“萌生”的现象，以防止勒苗。铲二、三遍时要细致，苗根有草不要用锄头拶，可以薅去，以免砍掉苗。趟地用铧镏子或用折三铧子（打翅的），同时绑一草把羁在铧的脖子上，以便培土，使垅顶形成方形，对于保根、抗旱、抗涝有一定作用。这种培土法并不影响深趟，只是使垅的坡度减少，和旧的培土法比较，利多弊少。
    经过这样的研究，便确定了宽播、等距、间苗、保苗的培植方法。
    宽播、等距、间苗培植法须根据当地垅底的宽窄与不同的农作物而定。宽播的尺度以能在原来耕作基础上得到适当的培土为度。等距间苗尚须分别土质作不同处理。各种农作物的单棵间隔，在腐植质多的肥沃黑土上，高粱须保持五寸，苞米一尺三，大豆四寸，谷子宽播三寸六至四寸五，留两行苗，间成狗咬纹形，株距一寸五（同行内）和二寸四（两行间）；在贫瘠的土地上（如沙土、黄土）高粱须保持六至七寸，苞米一尺五以上，大豆二寸半至三寸。在加宽播种面积的同时，必须注意大量供给作物所需的肥料，除上积肥外，必须及时追肥。
    为了贯彻这一新的增产方法，在群众中反复地进行了教育。春耕开始时向群众宣传了这种增产办法后，农民们感到惊奇和怀疑，有的说：“用鸡蛋壳量可以打这样多的粮，我干一辈子庄稼活都没听说过。”为了打破群众的思想顾虑，我们用许多高额产量的实例（这种实例几乎村村都有）来对农民进行教育。如十二区支援村杨二老头，一九四三年开一垧二亩（小垧）荒，收谷子五十石四斗；杨柳村张森半亩野生糜子收一石六斗。他们的主要经验也就是宽播、间苗和保证全苗。在组织农民座谈中，有的农民证明了这些事实；有的暗自计划想试试看；有的后悔地说：“这个办法提出太晚了，我的地快种完了。”有的农民说：“共产党真伟大，想不到的事都给我们想到了。”在播种时期，我们曾广泛组织干部与农民到地里检查，大大推动了改进播种工作，很多群众在小组内订立了播种上的各种技术要求，并普遍地进行了种籽消毒，仅二区就用了八百多斤烧酒拌种，以消灭黑穗病。
    全县在播种结束后，展开了技术评比，主要是检查种籽处理、播种的操作方法等，并研究了如何贯彻夏锄间苗、保苗、追肥工作。同时以此作为训练生产组骨干的内容。经过评比，群众的增产情绪是更加提高了。但在夏锄阶段铲趟头遍地时，发现有的农民在实行等距间苗时存有“惜苗”的思想，并怀疑是否真能达到计划产量，怕多费工钱。为了及时消除这些思想障碍，领导方面又广泛地组织了群众到先进的农民的地里去实地察看苗的距离，让群众自己算产量；又组织了三千多人到县示范农场去参观，这就更加强了农民实行新的增产方法的决心。此外并不断检查铲趟伤苗的情况以教育农民。在爱国增产运动中，县委曾决定加强支部工作，号召党员、团员积极学习增产技术，并带动群众。
    经过上述一系列工作后，计划创造新纪录的村几乎增加了一倍，而且产量比原计划增加了一倍到两倍，新纪录地增加到近十倍。群众对这一增产办法的认识也提高了。在此基础上，领导方面又发动了六千八百多人在五千一百五十九垧土地上进行了移苗补苗。
    由于这种新的增产法的逐步推广，要求生产组织形式适应于这一运动的发展，因此提出在红旗竞赛中，不仅要认真学习增产技术，而且要发动妇女和半劳动力参加生产，这就需要具体解决妇女参加生产的困难。如三区组织了老太太帮助下地的青年壮年妇女做饭、带孩子，各地普遍组织了妇女骨干实地学习间苗技术，有的地方派生产经验丰富的老农给妇女小组担任技术指导。这样便把农村中的男女老少都组织到增产运动中来，互相鼓舞，互相检查，以保证增产计划的实现。
    经过今年的增产运动，我们深深地体会到只要密切联系群众，深入地进行具体的调查研究，就可以不断地提高我们的工作，并取得所需要的知识。宽播、等距、间苗、保苗增产的方法，就是从当地农民今年与过去的高额产量经验中研究发掘出来的。这些经验过去在生产中也曾被采用过，但不为人所重视。今年的增产运动，生动地教育了我们在今后工作中应更敏锐地去体察新的事物，总结群众的经验，很好地运用已有的经验，推动我们的事业不断前进。
