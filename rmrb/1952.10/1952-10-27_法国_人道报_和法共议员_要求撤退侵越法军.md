Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 26th. The French newspaper "L'Humanité" prominently published news of the Vietnamese People's Army's victory in the Nghĩa Lộ campaign on the 20th. It also published a commentary reiterating the demand that the French government negotiate with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and immediately withdraw the French Expeditionary Force from Vietnam. The commentary pointed out that the news of the Nghĩa Lộ campaign in Vietnam showed that the French Expeditionary Force suffered significant losses. Continuing this war will have unimaginable consequences for France. The commentary said: Some enemies of the people are now forced to admit that France spends 500 billion francs annually on the war in Indochina, making a genuine economic recovery impossible.

The commentary exposed the Pinay government's unwillingness to end the war in Vietnam, and pointed out that when U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Allison was about to go to Saigon to examine whether France was fully complying with Washington's instructions, French Minister for Relations with the Associated States of Indochina, Letourneau, and Secretary of State for Defense, Chevigné, rushed to meet with Allison.

The commentary also said: The Pinay government considers demanding peace as a crime, therefore imprisoning the Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labour, Le Léap, and the leaders of the Republican Youth of France.

"L'Humanité" finally pointed out that peaceful negotiations with President Ho Chi Minh and the immediate withdrawal of the French Expeditionary Force from Vietnam is the only solution that aligns with the interests of the French people. "L'Humanité" called on the French people to unite, defeat the schemes of the traitors, and strive for a peaceful future.

Xinhua News Agency, 26th. TASS, Paris: The French National Assembly listened to a report on the 24th by Defense Minister Pleven regarding the defeat of the French Expeditionary Force in Northern Vietnam. While speaking about the loss of Nghĩa Lộ, one of France's main strongholds in Vietnam, Pleven attempted to explain the failure as being due to "climatic conditions unfavorable to the Expeditionary Force." At the same time, Pleven admitted the superior strength of the Vietnamese People's Army.

Communist Party member Cioccioni then spoke. He emphasized that the defeat of the French Expeditionary Force could not be explained by "climatic conditions." He said: "The war being waged in Indochina is unpopular. It violates the constitution and the UN Charter, and conflicts with the national interests of the French people." He further pointed out that the French Expeditionary Force is waging war against the entire Vietnamese people, which is the reason why the war is bound to fail from a military point of view.

Cioccioni concluded by saying that the French government has never responded to the repeated peace proposals made by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

When Cioccioni said that immediately engaging in peaceful negotiations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was the only decision that aligned with the fundamental wishes of the French people, Communist Party members applauded enthusiastically.

    法国“人道报”和法共议员
    要求撤退侵越法军
    【新华社布拉格二十六日电】法国“人道报”二十日以显著的版位刊载了越南人民军在义路战役获胜的消息，并发表评论重新要求法国政府与越南民主共和国政府进行谈判，并立即从越南撤退法国远征军。评论指出：越南义路战役消息说明了法国远征军蒙受重大的损失。这个战争再打下去，将使法国遭到不堪设想的后果。评论说：一些与人民为敌的人，现在也不得不承认，法国每年在印度支那花去战费五千亿法郎，就使得法国谈不上经济的真正恢复。
    评论揭露比内政府不想结束越南战争，并指出：当美国助理国务卿艾利逊正要到西贡去考察法国是不是完全遵从华盛顿的指示的时候，法国印度支那联邦成员国关系部部长勒都尔诺和国防部的德谢维尼赶去和艾利逊会谈。
    评论又说：比内政府将要求和平作为有罪，因此把法国总工会总书记勒里普以及法兰西共和青年联盟的领袖们关进牢狱里。
    “人道报”最后指出：与胡志明主席进行和平谈判和立即从越南撤退法国远征军，是符合法国人民利益的唯一解决办法。“人道报”号召法国人民联合行动起来，战胜卖国者的阴谋，努力争取和平的前途。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国国民议会于二十四日听取了国防部长普利文关于法国远征军在越南北部战败的报告。普利文谈到法军失去了法国在越南主要强大据点之一的义路时，企图解释这次失败是由于“对远征军不利的气候条件”。但同时普利文承认越南人民军的优越力量。
    共产党议员希奥沃尼接着发言。他强调指出：法国远征军的战败是不能够以“气候条件”来解释的。他说：“在印度支那所进行的战争是不得人心的。它违反了宪法和联合国宪章，并且与法国人民的民族利益相抵触。”他进一步指出：法国远征军是在向越南全体人民进行战争，这便是从军事观点来看，这次战争一定要失败的原因。
    希奥沃尼最后说：法国政府从来没有答复过越南民主共和国政府再三提出的和平建议。
    当希奥沃尼说到立刻与越南民主共和国进行和平谈判是唯一符合法国人民根本愿望的决定的时候，共产党议员们热烈地鼓掌。
