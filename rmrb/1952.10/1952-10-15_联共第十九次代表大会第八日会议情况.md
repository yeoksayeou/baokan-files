Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 14th: The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) continued its session on the 13th.

    The morning session was chaired by Niyazov.

    Kaganovich rose to speak, proposing a motion that was met with prolonged applause from the delegates.

    On behalf of the Central Committee of the Party, Kaganovich put forward a proposal to revise the Party Program.

    Kaganovich said that the 18th Congress had elected a commission to revise the program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). As everyone knows, the Party lost some outstanding comrades who were part of this commission - Comrades Kalinin, Zhdanov, Shcherbakov, and Yaroslavsky. The commission was therefore unable to carry out its task. The Great Patriotic War, the work of healing the wounds of war, and the extensive work of restoring the national economy hindered the completion of the commission's work.

    Currently, after the 19th Congress, conditions will be more favorable for carrying out this complex task. We have gained rich experience in the Great Patriotic War and in the work of restoring and further developing the national economy.

    Kaganovich continued, saying that the current period of our Party's work is fundamentally different from the period in 1919 when our Party adopted the Party Program. Since the 8th Congress adopted the current Party Program, fundamental changes have taken place in international relations and in the socialist construction of the Soviet Union. Our country has transformed from a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial-collective agricultural socialist country. The past multi-structural economy no longer exists; the socialist economic system and the two forms of socialist ownership - ownership by the whole people and collective farm ownership - dominate the entire economy. Under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, our country has built socialism.

    For more than thirty years since the adoption of the Party Program, the Party and its leader, Comrade Stalin, guided by creative Marxism-Leninism, have elevated the Party's theory and developed and enriched the theory of Marx, Engels, and Lenin with new scientific discoveries.

    The revised Party Program must embody all the new contributions made by our leader and teacher - the great Stalin - to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. (Stormy applause)

    The new, revised Party Program must summarize the world-historical experience of the great October Socialist Revolution, the experience of building socialism in the Soviet Union, and further point out the path to fulfilling the Party's main task - building a communist society by gradually transitioning from socialism to communism.

    The classic work of Comrade Stalin, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," plays a decisive role in the work of revising the Party Program and pointing out the path for further building communism. This great work is a major event in the ideological and theoretical life of our Party, in the ideological and theoretical life of all the nationalities of the Soviet Union, and in the ideological and theoretical life of all fraternal communist parties.

    It is our happiness that the brilliant and creative theoretical works of the great Stalin constantly enrich and arm our Party and the people of our country who are building communism. (Stormy and prolonged applause).

    Kaganovich then submitted a draft resolution on revising the Party Program to the 19th Party Congress for discussion. The hall resounded with stormy applause, and everyone stood up.

    Andriyanov then spoke, saying that since the revision of the Party Program was not a new issue, and the 18th Party Congress had already studied it, the delegates of the Congress were fully aware of it, so on behalf of the Leningrad and Moscow delegations, he proposed that this issue not be discussed and that the draft resolution proposed by Kaganovich be adopted.

    The motion of Andriyanov was passed at the meeting.

    The resolution on revising the Program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was unanimously adopted.

    The entire hall resounded with prolonged applause again.

    Next, the Chairman of the Communist Party of Germany, Max Reimann, spoke. The congress responded with thunderous and prolonged applause.

    Reimann extended fraternal combat greetings to the delegates of the 19th Congress. In the name of all the men and women of West Germany who are now fighting to defend peace and strive for German unification, he expressed deep gratitude to Stalin for all his efforts to secure a just peace treaty for the German people and to rebuild a unified Germany.

    The American imperialists, with the support of the Adenauer government, are turning West Germany into the main base for launching aggressive wars in Europe. They refuse to accept the Soviet Union's proposals for a peaceful resolution of the German question, and they do not allow the German people to obtain a peace treaty, national unification, and independence.

    Reimann emphasized that the residents of West Germany have begun to understand more and more clearly that the proposals of the Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic are the only path to a peaceful resolution of the German question.

    Reimann said, we guarantee to do everything in our power to prevent Germans from taking up arms against the peace-loving Soviet people and the people of other countries (his words won the stormy applause of all the delegates). We will unite all patriotic forces in West Germany in a broad movement to fight for a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

    Reimann concluded by cheering for the eternal friendship between the German people and the Soviet people, for the glorious and invincible Communist Party of the Soviet Union, for the genius leader and teacher of the working class of the world, and for Comrade Stalin, the best friend of the German people. The delegates stood up, and a storm of applause resounded throughout the hall. The Secretary of the Central Committee of the Icelandic United Socialist Party, Bjarnason, delivered a congratulatory speech and was warmly welcomed by the Congress. He said that the Icelandic people established their republic in 1944, but the United States conquered this new republic. The Icelandic people are bravely fighting to strengthen their resistance to American imperialism. In this struggle, the United Socialist Party is the leading and unifying force. The Icelandic people are not alone. Their struggle is sympathized with by millions of men and women who have been liberated from imperialist oppression.

    The Chairman of the Communist Party of Austria, Köplenich, addressed the Congress on behalf of the Communist Party of Austria and all progressive forces in Austria, and he was welcomed with stormy applause.

    He said that millions of people are closely watching the work of the 19th Party Congress, and the resolutions of the Congress will have historical significance for the working people of the world. The revised Party Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union depicts the noble image of a communist party member who is politically resolute and morally pure, and we must emulate this example.

    Köplenich continued, saying that West Austria is being drawn into the war preparations of the Atlantic aggressive bloc on an even larger scale. The Austrian people express their gratitude to the Soviet Union, because the fact that the American imperialists have not been able to completely engulf Austria to this day is entirely due to the Soviet Union. In their arduous struggle against the Western imperialists and their Austrian puppets who are trying to drag Austria into the Atlantic aggressive bloc, the members of the Communist Party of Austria draw new strength, courage, and confidence from the victories of the Soviet Union. We must do everything in our power to thwart the conspiracies of the warmongers.

    Köplenich cheered for the friend and teacher of the world, the great standard-bearer of communism, J. V. Stalin, and the whole hall responded with a storm of applause.

    The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Israel, Mikunis, expressed the warm fraternal congratulations of the Communist Party of Israel and the working people of Israel to the Congress. The delegates responded with applause.

    He said that the people of Israel have not forgotten and will never forget that the heroic Soviet army saved the world from fascist enslavement and rescued millions of Jewish people from the bloody claws of the Hitler gang.

    Due to the treacherous pro-American policy pursued by the Israeli government, this country has become an American-dominated area where American monopoly capitalists run rampant. The people of Israel are opposed to the plan to turn their country into an American military base.

    The Communist Party of Israel is leading the masses of the Israeli people in the struggle for peace and national independence, for bread and freedom, against the policy of discrimination against Arabs, and for friendship and cooperation with the people of the Middle East.

    Mikunis concluded by cheering for the heroic Soviet people, their great party, and their leader and teacher Comrade Stalin, and the whole hall responded with enthusiastic applause.

    The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Luxembourg, Urbany, on behalf of the Communist Party of Luxembourg and the working people of his country, expressed their love and gratitude to the Soviet Union, the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the great leader and teacher Comrade Stalin. (Prolonged applause)

    He emphasized the world-historical significance of this congress of the Lenin-Stalin Party. He said: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with its brilliant victories in socialist and communist construction, and with its policy of defending peace and national independence, gives the people of Luxembourg enormous help in their struggle against the imperialist war-makers. The people of Luxembourg are increasingly uniting under the banner of peace, democracy, and socialism, and rallying around the defender of peace and progress - the Soviet Union.

    When the General Secretary of the Swiss Labor Party, Wug, appeared on the stage, the delegates expressed a warm welcome.

    He said that participating in the work of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a great honor for our party, for the Swiss working class, and for all the true democrats and progressives in our country. Here they see the international fraternal solidarity shown by the great Lenin-Stalin Party in the struggle to uphold peace, democracy, and socialism with communist and workers' parties of all countries in the world.

    Wug pointed out that the Swiss Labor Party opposes the American bloc, upholds the national independence of the motherland, and advocates the establishment of genuine friendly relations with all countries - first and foremost with the Soviet Union, democratic China, and the people's democratic countries.

    When the representative of the Yugoslav Patriots' League, which is fighting to liberate the Yugoslav people from the fascist oppression and imperialist shackles of the Tito-Ranković clique, Popivoda, rose to speak, the hall resounded with stormy applause.

    He said, dear Soviet brothers, the representatives of the Yugoslav people are deeply grateful to be able to speak from the great stage of the 19th Congress of the Lenin-Stalin Party. This is a great honor and help for the Yugoslav people who are fighting against fascism. The Yugoslav people fully understand that you distinguish between the heroic Yugoslav people and the imperialist lackey clique that forcibly and deceptively seized power in Yugoslavia.

    Popivoda pointed out that the Yugoslav patriots, who are fighting to liberate the Yugoslav people from the fascist oppression and imperialist shackles of the Tito-Ranković clique, are filled with deep admiration and gratitude for Comrade Stalin. Thank you, Comrade Stalin, for exposing the true faces of the traitors and imperialist lackey bandits - the Tito-Ranković fascist clique - which is of great significance to the Yugoslav people and the entire international labor movement.

    This Yugoslav patriot representative recounted the tragic fate of the Yugoslav people living under a terrifying dictatorial system, and described the increasingly large-scale struggle waged by workers, peasants, and working intellectuals against the brutal Tito-Ranković regime. The American aggressors, with the assistance of their lackey Tito, are exploiting Yugoslavia's strategic raw materials and military bases.

    He continued, saying that the purpose of our league is to overthrow the fascist Tito regime, break the chains of imperialist enslavement, restore the people's democratic system in Yugoslavia, return Yugoslavia to the camp of democracy and socialism, restore its friendly relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and fight for international peace and cooperation. (Applause)

    Popivoda spoke of the boundless love of the revolutionaries and all working people of Yugoslavia for the Soviet Union, for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and for Comrade Stalin.

    He emphasized that we love the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) because it is the mother of all revolutionary parties of the working class, a treasure house of the greatest wisdom of mankind, and a model for promoting heroism and self-sacrifice for the benefit of the working people. It is dear and close to us because its creators are the greatest geniuses of mankind, Lenin and Stalin. We love it because it is deeply concerned about our people; we love it because it is engaged in a great cause for the victory of communism.

    Popivoda finally cheered for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and cheered for Comrade Stalin, and the hall resounded with a storm of applause.

    As Popivoda left the stage, the whole hall stood up, and the applause continued for a long time.

    The Congress read out congratulatory telegrams from the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of Mexico, Chile, Pakistan, Thailand, Ceylon, Paraguay, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Puerto Rico, the Central Committee of the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus, the leading organs of the Communist Party of San Marino, and the National Committee of the Communist Party of New Zealand. The reading of these congratulatory telegrams was repeatedly interrupted by prolonged applause.

    The communist party members and working people of these countries warmly congratulated the historically significant 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and paid tribute to the great Soviet people and to the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, Comrade Stalin. These congratulatory telegrams pointed out that the 19th Congress has great significance for the people of all countries and all communist parties in the world, and that this meeting shows the great achievements made by the Soviet state in transitioning from socialism to communism. The congratulatory telegrams pointed out that the example of the Soviet Union inspires the democratic and patriotic forces to fight for peace and democracy. The communist parties of these countries cheered for international friendship, for the invincible Lenin-Stalin party, for the bastion of peace and socialism, the Soviet Union, and for the great architect of communism, the leader and friend of the people of all countries, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin. The concluding remarks of these congratulatory telegrams aroused stormy and prolonged applause.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 14th: The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) continued its session on the afternoon of the 13th, chaired by Batolichev. The Congress heard a report from the committee elected by the Congress to review the proposals and supplements to the draft revision of the Party Constitution regarding the results of its work.

    The Congress unanimously passed the resolution on changing the name of the Party amidst stormy applause.

    The Congress then unanimously passed the resolution on revising the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), and passed the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Stormy applause continued for a long time, followed by cheers, resounding throughout the hall.

    The next meeting will be held on October 14th.

    联共第十九次代表大会第八日会议情况
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十四日电：苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会十三日继续开会。
    上午会议由尼雅佐夫担任主席。
    卡冈诺维奇起立发言，提出一项动议，得到了大会代表们的经久不息的掌声。
    卡冈诺维奇奉党中央委员会的命令，提出了一项关于修改党纲的建议。
    卡冈诺维奇说，第十八次代表大会曾选出了一个修改苏联共产党（布尔什维克）党纲的委员会。大家知道，党失去了组成这个委员会的若干卓越的同志——加里宁同志、日丹诺夫同志、谢尔巴科夫同志和雅罗斯拉夫斯基同志。委员会因而无法执行它的任务。伟大的卫国战争、医治战争创伤的工作以及恢复国民经济的范围广泛的工作，阻碍了委员会工作的完成。
    目前，在举行第十九次代表大会之后，条件将更加有利于这个复杂的工作的进行。我们在伟大卫国战争中以及在恢复和进一步发展国民经济的工作中取得了丰富的经验。
    卡冈诺维奇接着说，我党工作的目前时期，与一九一九年我党通过党纲的那个时期已有了根本的改变。自从第八次代表大会通过目前的党纲以来，在国际关系上、在苏联的社会主义建设方面都发生了根本的变化。我们的国家已从一个落后的农业国变成一个强大的工业—集体农业的社会主义国家。过去经济的多种结构已经不存在了；社会主义经济制度和社会主义所有制的两种形式——全民所有制和集体农场所有制——支配着整个的经济。在斯大林同志的领导下，我国已经建成了社会主义。
    自从党纲通过三十多年以来，党及其领袖斯大林同志以创造性的马克思—列宁主义为指南，已经提高了党的理论，并以科学的新发现发展和丰富了马克思—恩格斯—列宁的理论。
    修改了的党纲必须体现我们的领袖和导师——伟大的斯大林贡献给马克思—列宁主义宝库的一切新的东西。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    新的、修改了的党纲必须总结伟大的十月社会主义革命的世界—历史性经验，苏联建设社会主义的经验，并且进一步指明执行党的主要任务——通过逐渐从社会主义过渡到共产主义的办法建设共产主义社会——的道路。
    在修改党纲和指明进一步建设共产主义道路的工作上起决定性的重要作用的，是斯大林同志的经典著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。这部伟大著作在我党的思想和理论生活中，在苏联各族人民的思想和理论生活中，在所有兄弟共产党的思想和理论生活中，都是一个重大的事件。
    伟大斯大林的天才的、创造性的理论著作，使正在建设共产主义的我们的党和我国人民经常不断地丰富起来和武装起来，这是我们的幸福。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）。
    卡冈诺维奇接着把关于修改党纲的决议草案提交第十九次党代表大会讨论。会场上响起了暴风雨般的掌声，全体起立。
    安德里亚诺夫继起发言，他说，由于修改党纲并不是个新问题，并且第十八次党代表大会就早已研究过这个问题，代表大会代表对此都完全清楚，因此他代表列宁格勒和莫斯科代表团动议对于这个问题不进行讨论，并通过卡冈诺维奇所提出的决议草案。
    会上通过了安德里亚诺夫的动议。
    关于修改苏联共产党党纲的决议案一致通过。
    全场再度响起了经久不息的掌声。
    接着德国共产党主席马克斯·雷曼发言。大会报以雷动的长时间的鼓掌。
    雷曼向第十九次代表大会的代表们致以兄弟的战斗的敬礼。他以所有现在正在为保卫和平和争取德国统一而斗争的西德男女的名义，向斯大林表示深切的谢意，感谢他为德国人民谋取公正的和约和重建德国统一的一切努力。
    美帝国主义者在阿登纳政府的支持下，正把西德变为在欧洲进行侵略战争的主要基地。他们拒绝接受苏联关于和平解决德国问题的建议，他们不让德国人民获得和平条约、国家统一和独立。
    雷曼强调说，西德居民已开始愈来愈明白，苏联政府和德意志民主共和国政府的建议是和平解决德国问题的唯一道路。
    雷曼说，我们保证尽我们的一切力量阻止德国人拿起武器来反对爱好和平的苏联人民和其他国家人民（他的话博得了全体代表们的暴风雨般的掌声）。我们将把西德的一切爱国力量团结在争取一个统一的、民主的、爱好和平的德国的广泛运动中。
    雷曼最后为德国人民和苏联人民之间的永恒的友谊，光荣的不可战胜的苏联共产党，全世界工人阶级天才的领袖和导师、德国人民最好的朋友斯大林同志而欢呼。代表们起立，暴风雨般的鼓掌声响遍大厅。　冰岛统一社会党中央委员会书记柏雅那逊致贺词，受到代表大会的热烈欢迎。他说，冰岛人民在一九四四年建立了他们的共和国，但是美国征服了这个新的共和国。冰岛人民正在英勇地进行斗争，加强他们对美帝国主义的抵抗。在这个斗争中，统一社会党是领导和团结的力量。冰岛人民不是孤独的。他们的斗争得到千百万从帝国主义压迫下获得解放的男女的同情。
    奥地利共产党主席柯普勒尼希以奥地利共产党和奥地利所有进步力量的名义，向代表大会致贺，他受到暴风雨般鼓掌的欢迎。
    他说，千百万人民正在密切地注意第十九次党代表大会的工作，代表大会的决议对于世界劳动人民将具有历史性重要意义。苏联共产党的修改了的党章描绘出一个在政治上坚决、在道德上纯正的共产党员的崇高形像，我们一定要效法这个榜样。
    柯普勒尼希继续说，西奥地利正在更大规模地被拖到大西洋侵略集团的备战活动中。奥地利人民对苏联表示感激，因为美帝国主义者迄今未能完全吞没奥地利，完全是由于苏联的缘故。奥地利共产党党员在他们反对力图把奥地利拖入大西洋侵略集团的西方帝国主义者和他们的奥地利傀儡的艰苦斗争中，从苏联的胜利中汲取到新的力量、勇气和信心。我们一定要尽一切力量挫败战争贩子们的这些阴谋。
    柯普勒尼希为全世界的朋友和导师、共产主义的伟大旗手约·维·斯大林欢呼，全场报以暴风雨般的鼓掌。
    以色列共产党中央委员会总书记米库尼斯向大会表达了以色列共产党和以色列劳动人民的热烈的兄弟般的祝贺、代表们报以鼓掌。
    他说，以色列人民没有忘记而且永远不会忘记英勇的苏联军队把世界从法西斯奴役中拯救出来，而且把千百万犹太人民从希特勒匪帮的血爪中拯救出来。
    由于以色列政府奉行卖国亲美的政策，这个国家已经变成了美国垄断资本家在那里横行无忌的一个美国统治地。以色列人民是反对将他们国家变成美国军事基地的计划的。
    以色列共产党正在领导着以色列人民大众争取和平与民族独立、争取面包与自由、反对歧视阿拉伯人政策和争取与中东人民友好与合作的斗争。
    米库尼斯最后为英勇的苏联人民，他们伟大的党、他们的领袖与导师斯大林同志欢呼，全场报以热烈的鼓掌。
    卢森堡共产党中央委员会总书记欧班尼代表卢森堡共产党和他的国家的劳动人民向代表大会表示对于苏联、光荣的苏联共产党和伟大的领袖与导师斯大林同志的热爱和感激。（经久不息的掌声）
    他强调指出列宁—斯大林党这次代表大会的世界—历史性的意义。他说：苏联共产党，用它在社会主义和共产主义建设中的辉煌胜利，用它的保卫和平与民族独立的政策，给予卢森堡人民反对帝国主义战争制造者的斗争以巨大的帮助。卢森堡人民愈来愈多地团结在和平、民主与社会主义的旗帜下，围绕在和平与进步的捍卫者——苏联的周围。
    当瑞士劳工党总书记武格在讲台上出现时，代表们表示热烈的欢迎。
    他说，参加苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的工作，对于我们的党，对于瑞士工人阶级，对于我国所有的真正民主分子和进步分子是一个极大的荣幸。他们在这里看见了伟大的列宁—斯大林党在为了维护和平、民主和社会主义而进行的斗争中所表现的与世界各国共产党和工人党的国际兄弟团结。
    武格指出，瑞士劳工党反对美国集团，拥护祖国的民族独立，拥护与所有的国家——首先是与苏联，民主中国和人民民主国家——建立真正的友好关系。
    争取从铁托—兰科维奇集团的法西斯压迫和帝国主义束缚下解放南斯拉夫人民的南斯拉夫爱国者联盟的代表波皮沃达起立发言时，会场上响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    他说，亲爱的苏联兄弟们，南斯拉夫人民的代表也能到列宁—斯大林党第十九次代表大会的伟大讲台上来讲话，心中十分感激。这对正在与法西斯主义作斗争的南斯拉夫人民是一个极大的荣幸和帮助。南斯拉夫人民十分了解，你们对于英勇的南斯拉夫人民和用强迫欺骗的手段夺取了南斯拉夫政权的帝国主义走狗集团是分别看待的。
    波皮沃达指出，正在争取从铁托—兰科维奇集团的法西斯压迫和帝国主义束缚下解放南斯拉夫人民的南斯拉夫爱国者心中，充满了对斯大林同志的十分钦仰和感激的情绪。谢谢斯大林同志，卖国贼和帝国主义走狗匪帮——铁托—兰科维奇法西斯集团——的本来面目被揭露了，这对南斯拉夫人民和整个国际劳工运动具有非常重大的意义。
    这位南斯拉夫爱国者代表叙述了在恐怖的独裁制度下面过活的南斯拉夫人民的悲惨命运，并叙述了工人、农民和劳动知识分子对残暴的铁托—兰科维奇政权进行的规模日益巨大的斗争。美国侵略者正在他们的走狗铁托的援助下，利用南斯拉夫的战略原料和军事基地。
    他接着说，我们的联盟的目的就是推翻法西斯铁托政权，挣断帝国主义奴役的锁链，在南斯拉夫恢复人民民主制度，使南斯拉夫回到民主和社会主义阵营，恢复它与苏联和人民民主国家间的友好关系，并为国际的和平与合作而斗争。（掌声）
    波皮沃达谈到南斯拉夫的革命者和全体劳动人民对苏联，对苏联共产党和斯大林同志的无限热爱。
    他强调说，我们热爱光荣的苏联共产党（布尔什维克），因为他是工人阶级所有革命政党的母亲，是人类最伟大的智慧的宝库，是为了劳动人民的利益发扬英雄主义和自我牺牲精神的典范。它对我们是亲爱的和亲近的，因为它的缔造者是人类最伟大的天才列宁和斯大林。我们热爱它，因为它十分关怀我们的人民；我们热爱它，因为它正在为共产主义的胜利而从事伟大的事业。
    波皮沃达最后欢呼苏联共产党，欢呼斯大林同志，会场上响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    在波皮沃达离开讲台时，全场起立，掌声经久不息。
    代表大会宣读了墨西哥、智利、巴基斯坦、泰国、锡兰、巴拉圭、厄瓜多尔、危地马拉和波多黎各共产党中央委员会，塞浦路斯劳动人民进步党中央委员会，圣马力诺共产党领导机构及新西兰共产党全国委员会的贺电。这些贺电的宣读一再为经久不息的掌声所打断。
    这些国家的共产党员和劳动人民热烈地祝贺具有历史意义的苏联共产党第十九次代表大会并向伟大的苏联人民以及全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师斯大林同志致敬。这些贺电指出：第十九次代表大会对于各国人民和全世界所有共产党具有伟大的意义，这次会议表明了正在从社会主义过渡到共产主义的苏维埃国家所取得的伟大成就。贺电指出：苏联的榜样鼓舞着民主爱国的力量为争取和平与民主而斗争。这些国家的共产党人为国际间的友好、为不可战胜的列宁—斯大林的党、为和平与社会主义的堡垒苏联而欢呼，为共产主义的伟大的建筑大师、各国人民的领袖和朋友约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林而欢呼。这些贺电的结束语都引起了暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声。
