    Yangquan Coal Mine Should Improve Coal Quality
    To the Editor: Since the "Three-Anti" Movement, the coal production of the Yangquan Mine, under the Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, has significantly increased, but the quality has deteriorated day by day. If this situation of low coal quality is not resolved as soon as possible, it will not only cause losses in industrial production but also affect the reputation of state-owned trade and the sales of industrial products. For several months, the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company has promptly informed the Yangquan Mine of the declining coal quality and the opinions of users in various regions, but there has been no improvement to date. For example, in April, the East China Coal and Building Materials Company allocated 300 tons of Yangquan coal to the Shanghai Dasheng Textile Factory No. 3. According to the factory's trade union, 140 jin of gangue (coal containing stone) could be picked out from every 300 jin of Yangquan coal. Jiangyin Huaming Power Plant, Huilun Cloth Factory, and Changzhou Coal and Iron Industry have all questioned the large amount of gangue contained in Yangquan coal. The supply section of Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory reflected that this year they allocated 1,000 tons of Yangquan mixed coal to their employees, and among the 400 tons of lump coal, there were 50 tons of pebbles. According to statistics from Comrade Yao Lujun of the Nanjing Coal and Building Materials Branch, the transportation and handling costs for the gangue and pebbles contained in Yangquan coal shipped to East China amount to 1.5 billion yuan annually. We believe that "improving coal quality" should be one of the most pressing tasks for the mine and is also a general requirement of coal users in various regions. We suggest that the relevant responsible departments promptly investigate the above situation and urge the Yangquan Mine to provide a practical guarantee for the quality of coal produced in the future.

### 阳泉煤矿应该提高产煤质量

    阳泉煤矿应该提高产煤质量
    编辑同志：中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局所属阳泉矿生产的煤，在“三反”运动以后，产量较前显著提高，但质量日趋低劣。这种煤质低劣的情形如不及早加以解决，不但会使工业生产遭受损失，而且会影响国营贸易的信誉和工业品的推销工作。数月来中国煤业建筑器材公司曾将煤质降低的情形及各地用户的意见，及时告知阳泉矿，但至今仍无改进。比如，四月间华东区煤建公司拨给上海大生纺织三厂阳泉煤三百吨，据该厂工会反映，在三百斤阳泉煤中，就能拣出僵块（含石性煤）一百四十斤。江阴华明电厂、汇纶布厂、常州煤铁业都对阳泉煤内含有多量僵块的情形提出质问。石家庄大兴纱厂供应科反映：今年他们拨给职工一千吨阳泉混煤，其中四百吨块煤中就有五十吨碣石。据南京煤建分公司姚禄钧同志统计：调运到华东的阳泉煤所含的僵石、碣石占用的运输装卸费用，每年即达人民币十五亿元。我们认为“提高煤质”应是矿方目前最迫切的任务之一，也是各地用煤户普遍的要求。我们建议有关负责部门，对上述情况速予检查，并督促阳泉矿对今后产煤质量提出切实保证。
