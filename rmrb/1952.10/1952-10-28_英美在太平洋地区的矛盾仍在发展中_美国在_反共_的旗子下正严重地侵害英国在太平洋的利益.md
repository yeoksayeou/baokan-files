Xinhua News Agency, 26th. The Anglo-American contradictions in the Pacific region, which were brought to the surface by Britain's exclusion from the core of the Pacific aggressive bloc organized by the United States, are still developing.

    The American ruling clique is actively using the "ANZUS Council" as the core for organizing the Pacific aggressive bloc and seizing dominance in the Pacific. The United States has consistently insisted on excluding Britain from the core of this aggressive bloc. As early as the first meeting of the so-called "ANZUS Council" in early August, Britain requested to participate, but the United States replied that "it was too early." On September 22nd, when the United States, Australia, and New Zealand held a military representative meeting of the three-country council in Honolulu, the United States, disregarding the reasons personally put forward by British Prime Minister Churchill, even refused Britain's request to send observers to the meeting.

    The United States' deliberate and blatant seizure of British colonial interests in the Pacific in the process of piecing together the Pacific bloc is increasingly causing unease and resentment among the British ruling class. United Press International, London, September 25th, reported: British officials believe that not allowing Britain to participate in the US-Australia-New Zealand meeting "is an act of 'direct American interference' in federal affairs." The British bourgeois press openly stated that the United States' refusal to allow Britain to attend the Honolulu meeting shows that the United States not only wants to drive Britain out of the Pacific but also out of Britain's dominions. The "Daily Mail" said with a mixture of grievance and indignation: "Since Britain cannot enter through the front door, it tries to sneak in through the back door. Britain begged: If it cannot send a delegation (Britain has the right to send a delegation), then let Britain send observers to attend. But the answer was: 'No.' It seems that even the back door has a sign saying 'No Entry.' If we lose our position here and lose it there, then we will soon lose everything. If we silently endure this rude refusal, then all our rights will gradually be deprived."

    Britain is unwilling to have its "all rights deprived," so it will naturally try to sneak into the core of the Pacific aggressive bloc through the "front door" or "back door." However, this effort by Britain continues to be blocked by the United States. According to a Reuters report from Canberra on October 12th, "Authorities in the Australian capital said yesterday that the United States has warned Australia that it will abandon the ANZUS treaty if Australia and New Zealand demand that Britain participate." According to the "News Chronicle's" diplomatic observer, although the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Australia have expressed their willingness for Britain to participate in the Pacific Pact, "some government officials and entrepreneurs in Australia are probably willing to maintain good relations with the United States rather than appease the angered British."

    This centrifugal tendency of the British Commonwealth dominions towards the British Empire, which reflects the open and covert struggle between the Anglo-American ruling groups in the Pacific region, has alarmed the British bourgeois press. According to a Reuters report from Manchester on October 13th, the "Manchester Guardian" said: "Britain's exclusion from the Pacific Council has caused Britain's prestige to plummet." "None of the reasons given by the United States for not accepting Britain's participation is convincing, nor does any of them conceal the fact that the real reason is the shift of power." The newspaper pointed out: That is, "Australia and New Zealand are shifting their focus from their alliance with Britain to their alliance with the United States."

    Thus, in the Pacific region, American imperialism, under the banner of "opposing communism," is seriously infringing upon Britain's traditional interests in the Pacific. While the British ruling clique is still obsequiously following and implementing American policies, it has to continue to resist the United States' frenzied offensive to seize British interests in the Pacific. United Press International, London, July 7th, reported: "British officials have made it clear that Britain does not recognize the recent rejection of its request to join the Council as valid. It will raise its request to send observers to the Council again after discussing it with representatives from Australia and New Zealand who will come to London next month for the Commonwealth Conference."

    英美在太平洋地区的矛盾仍在发展中
    美国在“反共”的旗子下正严重地侵害英国在太平洋的利益
    【新华社二十六日讯】随着英国被排斥于美国所组织的太平洋侵略集团的核心之外而表面化的英美在太平洋地区的矛盾，现在仍在发展中。
    美国统治集团正积极利用“澳新美理事会”作为组织太平洋侵略集团的核心与攫取太平洋的统治地位的工具。美国始终坚持将英国排斥在这一侵略集团的核心的门外。早在八月初所谓“澳新美理事会”举行第一次会议时，英国就要求参加，美国的答复是“为时尚属过早”。九月二十二日美澳新三国在檀香山举行三国理事会的军事代表会议时，美国不顾英国首相邱吉尔亲自提出的理由，甚至对英国派遣观察员列席会议的请求，也飨以闭门羹。
    美国在拼凑太平洋集团的过程中这样处心积虑而又露骨地夺取英国在太平洋的殖民利益，正日益引起英国统治阶级的不安和愤懑。合众社伦敦九月二十五日消息说：英国官员们认为不让英国参加美澳新三国会议，“是‘美国直接干涉’联邦事务的行为”。英国资产阶级报纸公开地说：美国拒绝英国参加檀香山会议，这表明美国不仅要把英国撵出太平洋，而且要把英国撵出英国的自治领。“每日邮报”怀着委屈与愤懑交集的心情说：“既然英国从正门进不去，于是便设法从后门钻进去。英国央求：如果不能派代表团（英国是有权派代表团的）的话，那末也让英国派遣观察员出席。但回答却是：‘不行’。看来，就是后门也挂着‘此路不通’的牌子。如果我们自己的地位这里也丧失掉，那里也丧失掉，那末很快就要丧失殆尽了。如果我们对这种无礼的拒绝默加忍受，那末我们的一切权利都会渐渐被剥夺去的。”
    英国既不甘愿自己的“一切权利被剥夺”，自然就还要设法从“正门”或“后门”钻进太平洋侵略集团的核心。但是英国的这种努力正继续受到美国的阻挠。据路透社堪培拉十月十二日消息，“澳大利亚首都权威人士昨天说：美国已向澳大利亚提出警告：如果澳大利亚和新西兰要求让英国参加，它将放弃美澳新公约。”而据“新闻纪事报”的外交观察家说：虽然澳大利亚的总理和外交部长表示愿意英国参加太平洋公约，“但是，澳大利亚一部分政府官员和一些企业家恐怕是宁愿与美国维持良好关系，而不愿去安慰发了怒的英国人。”
    这种反映了英美统治集团在太平洋地区明争暗斗的英联邦自治领对大英帝国的离心倾向，引起了英国资产阶级报纸的惊叫。据路透社曼彻斯特十三日消息，“曼彻斯特卫报”说：“英国被摈弃在太平洋理事会门外，使得英国的威望一落千丈。”“美国不接受英国参加的理由中，没有一项理由是令人信服的，也没有一项理由能掩饰这样一个事实：真正的原因是力量的转移。”该报指出：那就是“澳大利亚和新西兰把重心从它们与英国的联盟转移到它们与美国的联盟”。
    这样，在太平洋地区打着“反对共产主义”旗子的美帝国主义，正在严重地侵害英国在太平洋的传统利益。英国统治集团一面仍在卑躬屈节地追随和执行着美国的政策，一面不得不继续对美国夺取英国在太平洋的利益的疯狂进攻进行抵抗。合众社伦敦七日消息说：“英国官员明白表示，英国并不承认最近对它请求参加理事会的拒绝是有效的。它将在下月与来伦敦举行联邦会议的澳大利亚和新西兰的代表商谈之后再行提出它要派观察员列席理事会的要求。”
