    Thank You, Heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    Liang Sicheng, Professor of Tsinghua University

    You, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, have crossed the Yalu River and fought side-by-side with the Korean People's Army against the American invading army for two years. This lofty internationalist and patriotic action has achieved a great victory, safeguarding world peace, inspiring the liberation struggle of oppressed nations worldwide, and educating the broad masses of the Chinese people, guaranteeing and promoting the progress of the motherland's various construction undertakings. On this significant anniversary, recalling the victories on the Korean front and the brilliant achievements of the motherland's construction deepens my love for the motherland even further.

    When the invading American army approached our border, I supported Premier Zhou Enlai's statement that we "cannot stand idly by"; however, I did not know how to "deal" with it. When you, the heroic Volunteer Army, crossed the border and achieved a brilliant victory in the Battle of the Chongchon River, my confidence was strengthened. Subsequent victories, one after another, allowed me to see the concrete manifestation of the power of the people time and time again. At the same time, the American imperialists' massacre of women and children, indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities, abuse and killing of prisoners of war, and use of inhumane bacteriological weapons in Korea, these facts repeatedly showed me the true face of American civilization, the true face of American science and technology, and cleared away the remnants of my pro-American and worshipful-of-America thoughts.

    Domestically, in these two years, I have seen the great victory of the land reform movement. I have seen the great victory of the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries. I have seen the great victory of the ideological remolding movement. I have seen young men and women across the country respond so enthusiastically to the call to defend the motherland, with tens of thousands enlisting in the army. I have also seen the enthusiasm of the people across the country in supporting the Volunteer Army, donating enough money for more than three thousand seven hundred aircraft in one go. I have witnessed the complete failure of the American imperialists' embargo and blockade against us, and I have seen the continuous emergence of miracles in our country's economic construction. Every single one of these things cannot but move me.

    In such a review, I realize that from the "miracles" of national-scale brilliant construction to my own insignificant self-transformation, none of it could have been achieved without the protection of you, the heroic Volunteer Army, and the inspiration of your heroic deeds. I also think: What kind of special people are these respectable and lovable protectors, inspirers, and educators of ours? No, most of you come from the fields of the motherland. Our most beloved people are the "ordinary" working people. This realization has strengthened my class feelings and consolidated my newly transformed class stance.

    Chairman Mao has repeatedly told us that the Chinese people are diligent, brave, and full of wisdom. Three years ago, at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Mao declared to the world: "The Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population, have stood up." My understanding of these words in the past was not profound enough. The great victory of resisting America and aiding Korea and the brilliant achievements of the motherland's construction over the past two years are the victories and achievements of the heroic Volunteer Army and the diligent, brave, and wise working people. All these victories and achievements have made the People's Republic of China one of the most powerful, most respected, and most feared countries in the world. Our international status has been elevated to an unprecedented level. Only now can I truly appreciate the meaning of "we have stood up." This realization comes from the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea.

    I also loved my motherland in the past. I loved her magnificent rivers and mountains, her vast and beautiful land, and her rich and splendid cultural heritage, but that was not enough. Under reactionary rule, my love for the motherland could only be limited to caressing an ancient brick, appreciating the ancient Zhao County Bridge, and marveling at the architecture of the Temple of Heaven. Even more painful is that these passive patriotic feelings with a nostalgic and melancholic tone were actually trampled upon and utilized by the reactionary rulers and American imperialists. In fact, I served them for twenty years. The two years of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and a series of movements carried out under the guarantee of this great movement—especially the "Three-Anti" movement and the ideological remolding movement—have made me realize that the motherland has even more lovable things, that is, the great, diligent, brave, and wise working people. The outstanding sons and daughters who make up the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are the most outstanding examples. Therefore, the content of the motherland that I love is richer than the motherland I knew in the past. I love my motherland a thousand times more!

    As an architectural worker, I thank you—the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army—for guaranteeing that we can carry out peaceful construction for the motherland. As a people's teacher, I thank you for educating us and helping us with our ideological remolding, thereby promoting the adjustment of departments and faculties in universities. As a Chinese, I thank you for defending "our beloved motherland" and ensuring that she "will embark on prosperity and strength from now on." As a person who loves the motherland, I thank you for enriching the content of my concept of the motherland; I thank you for teaching me to love the working people. As a person who loves peace, I thank you for defending world peace with your flesh and blood, making the whole world firmly believe that peace will surely triumph over war! I thank you, our most respectable and most lovable people!

    感谢你们，英勇的中国人民志愿军
    清华大学教授　梁思成
    你们，英勇的中国人民志愿军跨过鸭绿江和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，反击美国侵略军，已经两年了。这一崇高的国际主义和爱国主义行动的伟大胜利，保卫了世界和平，鼓舞了全世界被压迫民族的解放斗争，也教育了全中国的广大人民，保障了和推动了祖国的各项建设事业的进行。在这意义重大的纪念日，回忆两年来朝鲜前线的胜利和祖国建设的辉煌成就，更加深了我对祖国的热爱。
    当侵朝美军逼近我们边境时，我拥护周恩来总理的声明，我们“不能置之不理”；但是我不知道应该如何“理”法。等到你们，英勇的志愿军一跨过国境，在清川江的一次战役中就取得了辉煌的胜利，我的信心坚定了。以后一次又一次的胜利，使我一次又一次地看见了人民力量的具体表现。同时，美帝国主义在朝鲜屠杀妇女儿童、滥炸和平城市、虐杀战俘、使用灭绝人性的细菌武器，这些事实，一次又一次地使我清楚地看到了美国文明的真面目，美国科学技术的真面目，肃清了我崇美亲美的思想残余。
    在国内，这两年中，我看到了土地改革运动的伟大胜利。看到了大张旗鼓地镇压反革命的伟大胜利。看到了思想改造运动的伟大胜利。看到了全国青年男女那样热烈地响应保卫祖国的号召，成千成万地报名参军。我也看到了全国人民支援志愿军的热情，一口气就捐献了三千七百多架飞机。我看见了美帝国主义对我们的禁运和封锁的彻底失败，看到了我国经济建设上不断涌现出来的奇迹，每一桩事情，都不能不使我感动。
    在这样一次的回忆中，我体会到从全国性的辉煌建设的“奇迹”到我个人渺小的自我改造，哪一件不是在你们，英勇的志愿军的保卫下和你们的英雄事迹的鼓舞下才取得的。我又想：我们这些可敬可爱的保卫者、鼓舞者、教育者又是些什么特殊人物呢？不是的，你们绝大多数都来自祖国的田间。我们最可爱的人就是“平凡”的劳动人民。这样的体会增强了我的阶级情感，巩固了我新近转变过来的阶级立场。
    毛主席曾多次告诉我们：中国人民是勤劳、勇敢、富有智慧的。三年前，毛主席在中国人民政协第一届全体会议上，向全世界宣布：“占人类总数四分之一的中国人从此站立起来了。”我过去对这几句话的体会是不够深刻的。两年来抗美援朝的伟大胜利和祖国建设的辉煌成就就是英勇的志愿军和勤劳、勇敢、智慧的劳动人民的胜利和成就。这一切胜利和成就已使中华人民共和国成为世界最强大、最受尊敬、最使敌人畏惧的国家之一。我们的国际地位空前地提高了。这样我可真正地体会到“我们已经站起来了”的意义了。这样的体会是从抗美援朝的胜利中得来的。
    我过去也热爱我的祖国，我爱她的锦绣河山，宽广美丽的土地，爱她丰富灿烂的文化遗产，不过那是不够的。在反动统治之下，我对祖国的爱，只能限制在对一块古砖的摩娑，限制在对赵县古桥的欣赏，在对天坛建筑的赞叹上。更痛心的，就是这些带有怀古幽情的消极的爱国感情，也竟被反动统治者和美帝国主义者践踏和利用，实际上我为它们服务了二十年。两年的抗美援朝运动，以及在这伟大运动的保障下进行的一系列的运动——特别是“三反”运动和思想改造运动，使我认识了祖国更可爱的东西，那就是伟大的、勤劳、勇敢、智慧的劳动人民。组成中国人民志愿军的优秀儿女就是最优秀的典型。因此，我所爱的祖国的内容，比过去所认识的祖国更为丰富了。我更千百倍地爱我的祖国！
    作为一个建筑工作者，我感谢你们——英勇的中国人民志愿军保证了我们得以为祖国进行和平建设。作为一个人民教师，我感谢你们教育了我们，帮助了我们的思想改造，从而促进了高等学校的院系调整。作为一个中国人，我感谢你们保卫着“我们亲爱的祖国”，保证她“从今走上繁荣富强”。作为一个爱祖国的人，我感谢你们丰富了我对祖国的观念的内容；感谢你们教会了我热爱劳动人民。作为一个爱好和平的人，我感谢你们以你们的血肉，保卫了世界和平，使全世界坚定地相信，和平必定战胜战争！我感谢你们，我们最可敬、最可爱的人！
