Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 22nd: The UN General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the 20th to continue the general debate.

　　The Peruvian representative, Belaunde, spoke in support of the US position on the Korean issue.

　　The Australian representative, Casey, as usual, made slanderous anti-Soviet remarks and expressed support for the US position on the Korean issue and at the Panmunjom armistice negotiations. Then he talked about the relationship between non-self-governing territories and colonial countries. His opinion was: The United Nations should not interfere in this relationship, and colonial countries should have full freedom to exploit the people of non-self-governing territories.

　　The Bolivian representative, Suazo, then spoke, talking about Bolivia's economic problems. He emphasized that for many years, a group of tin mining tycoons joined forces with feudal landlords to cruelly exploit the broad masses of the Bolivian people. The extremely high mortality rate and extremely low wages in Bolivia proved this fact. This unbearable situation inevitably led to the development of the liberation movement in Bolivia, in which representatives of the middle class, workers, and peasants participated. He also said that Bolivia's economy had been threatened by the pressure exerted by foreign buyers who purchased Bolivian raw materials.

　　The Uruguayan representative, Charron, requested assistance for underdeveloped countries.

　　The head of the Czechoslovak delegation, Sekaninová, refuted the remarks of the Australian representative, Casey, in her speech, pointing out that Casey made the slander in order to divert the attention of the General Assembly from the colonial countries' plunder of the people of dependent countries. She condemned the US ruling clique for reviving German militarism and explained that the Czechoslovak people fully recognized the importance of a fair solution to the German question in accordance with the Soviet government's proposal.

　　Sekaninová wholeheartedly supported the Polish delegation's proposal to eliminate the threat of another world war and strengthen international peace and friendly cooperation. She particularly emphasized that the General Assembly must take resolute measures to stop the Korean War. All peace-loving mankind demanded the restoration of peace in Korea and demanded an end to the US aggressors' despicable crime of using bacteriological weapons against the Korean and Chinese people.

　　Sekaninová then spoke about the issue of US interference in the internal affairs of other countries. She pointed out that Czechoslovakia had become the target of hostile actions instigated by the US government. In violation of universally recognized principles of international law, the US government was training saboteurs and criminals and sending them to Czechoslovakia to carry out espionage and establish terrorist and subversive organizations. The purpose of US policy was to undermine the peaceful construction of Czechoslovakia and other peace-loving countries, which constituted a threat to international peace and security. Therefore, the Czechoslovak delegation requested the General Assembly to discuss the important and urgent issue of US interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

　　Since no more representatives expressed a desire to speak in the general policy debate, the plenary session's general debate was temporarily adjourned and would continue when someone requested to speak.

    联合国大会二十日继续进行一般辩论
    捷代表强调必须制止侵朝战争
    并制止美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会二十日举行全体会议，继续进行一般辩论。
    秘鲁代表碧朗第发言支持美国在朝鲜问题上所采取的立场。
    澳大利亚代表卡希照例发表了反苏的诽谤言论，而且表示支持美国在朝鲜问题上和在板门店停战谈判中所采取的立场。随后他就谈到非自治地区与殖民国家之间的关系问题。他的意见是：联合国不应该干涉这种关系，殖民国家应该有剥削非自治地区人民的充分自由。
    玻利维亚代表苏亚索随后发言，他谈到了玻利维亚的经济问题。他强调说：许多年来，一群经营锡矿的富豪与封建地主联合起来对玻利维亚广大人民群众进行残酷的剥削，玻利维亚极高的死亡率和极端菲薄的工资，就证明了这一事实。这种难以忍受的情况，不可避免地使玻利维亚国内的解放运动开展起来，参加这个运动的有中等阶级、工人和农民的代表。他又说：由于购买玻利维亚原料的外国买主对玻利维亚施用压力，玻利维亚的经济已经受到威胁。
    乌拉圭代表查龙奈要求援助落后国家。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长塞卡尼诺娃在发言中驳斥了澳大利亚代表卡希的言论，并指出卡希所以进行诽谤是为了要转移大会对于殖民国家掠夺附属国人民的注意。她谴责美国统治集团复活德国军国主义，并说明捷克斯洛伐克人民充分认识到按照苏联政府的建议公平解决德国问题的重要性。
    塞卡尼诺娃衷心拥护波兰代表团所提出的消除另一次世界大战威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作的建议。她特别强调说，大会必须采取坚决措施制止朝鲜战争。全体爱好和平的人类都要求在朝鲜恢复和平，要求制止美国侵略者对朝鲜和中国人民使用卑鄙的细菌武器的罪行。
    塞卡尼诺娃接着谈到美国干涉其他国家内政问题。她指出，捷克斯洛伐克已成为美国政府策动的敌对行动的目标。美国政府违反举世公认的国际法准则，正在训练破坏分子和罪犯，并派遣他们到捷克斯洛伐克，进行间谍活动和建立恐怖及颠覆组织。美国政策的目的在破坏捷克斯洛伐克和其他爱好和平国家的和平建设，这构成了对国际和平与安全的威胁。因此，捷克斯洛伐克代表团要求大会讨论美国干涉其他国家内政这个重要又迫切的问题。
    由于不再有代表表示希望在一般政策辩论中发言，全体会议一般辩论暂告一段落，至有人要求发言时再继续举行。
