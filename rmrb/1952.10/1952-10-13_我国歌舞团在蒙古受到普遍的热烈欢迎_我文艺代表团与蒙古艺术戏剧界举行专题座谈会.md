Under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and with the help of the Soviet Union, especially in the past ten years, Mongolian people's art has made significant progress. Now, there are organizations guiding art in all provinces of Mongolia. Art exhibitions have been held every year since 1949.
