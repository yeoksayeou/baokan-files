    Unite as One to Defend Peace
    —Report on the Second Day of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Guo Moruo, Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation
    Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:
    Today, the sixteen hundred million people of the Asian and Pacific regions entrust their lofty aspirations for peace in Asia, the Pacific, and the world to the peace conference we are holding here. This makes us deeply feel the responsibility of each of our representatives to fight for the cause of peace and the historical significance of this peace conference.
    Since the adjournment of the Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held from June 3rd to 6th this year, the people of countries along the Pacific Rim in Asia, Australia, and the Americas have actively taken action, enthusiastically endorsing the declaration of the preparatory meeting and the proposals on various preparatory tasks, and actively electing their representatives to hold the current Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. This fully demonstrates how eager the sixteen hundred million people in this region, like all good people in the world, are for peace.
    When we accepted the entrustment of our people to participate in this conference, we each had a very clear impression in our memories. That is the common demand expressed by loving parents, innocent children, and young couples in millions of peaceful families. They demand that everyone be free from the fear and anxiety of war and live peaceful lives so that, under possible conditions, life can become more fulfilling. This kind of good wish for a peaceful life deeply moves everyone with a conscience.
    However, the shadow of war insists on threatening us. And this threat is now becoming increasingly serious, forcing us to urgently mobilize to defend peace.
    Delegates, today people clearly see that in our region, the flames of war in Korea have been burning for more than two years, and the armistice negotiations have been going on for more than a year. People are eager to stop the Korean War in order to pave the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and other issues in the Far East. However, during the armistice negotiations, peaceful residents in Korea and Northeast China suffered the harm of inhuman germ warfare. This appalling crime has recently been confirmed by the investigation of the International Scientific Commission composed of impartial scientists from six countries—Britain, France, Italy, Sweden, the Soviet Union, and Brazil. At the same time, the power stations on the Yalu River on the border between Korea and China, as well as peaceful construction, peaceful cities, and peaceful residents in northern Korea, are constantly subjected to crazy bombing; in the POW camps in Geoje Island, Busan, Jeju Island, and other places, captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are constantly being massacred in large numbers. Armistice negotiations continue to be delayed and are constantly subjected to barbaric obstruction, and the Korean War is in danger of continuing to be prolonged and expanded. This poses a direct and serious threat to the peace of the Asian and Pacific regions.
    Delegates, we see very clearly that the US government and its generals have violated the wishes of the American people, violated international agreements that countries around the world, including the United States, have unanimously signed, and abandoned the traditions of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln, and are striving to pursue a war policy. This is already a fact that cannot be concealed in the slightest. They are constantly intensifying war propaganda and frantically engaging in activities that undermine peace and provoke war in all aspects. They have already formed the "North Atlantic Treaty" group and are brewing the organization of the "Pacific Pact" group and the Middle East group. They are doing their utmost to create international tensions and create new war dangers.
    Under the war policy of the US government, the internal affairs of many countries are being interfered with by foreign countries, and foreign military bases are constantly expanding in various countries in eastern and southern Asia, Australia, the Americas, the Near East, the Middle East, North Africa, and Western Europe. Many countries have not achieved true national independence, or their independent sovereignty is suffering from increasingly serious infringements. From the perspective of the situation in Southeast Asian countries, US monopoly capital has controlled many important economic lifelines and is constantly creating excuses to seize more privileges in these countries. Therefore, the US government's many violent interferences in the political and military affairs of these countries have followed one after another. The United States is also assisting other countries in their armed intervention in Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam and Malaya, and is doing its utmost to provoke conflicts between Asian countries and between various ethnic groups within countries, spreading seeds of racial discrimination, religious disputes, and discord. As for the Middle Eastern countries, such as Iran, Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, they are also being ravaged by unequal trade from the United States, their industries and agriculture are declining, and their trade and payments have huge deficits, putting their national finances in trouble. As a result of inflation and rising prices, the cost of living has risen sharply. Compared with before the war in 1951, Iran was 750 percent, Turkey was 500 percent, and Iraq was 400 percent. This prompts the people of Asian countries to rise up first to oppose the war policy of the United States. Under the war policy of the US government, the US military budget has reached an astronomical figure. Not to mention the distant past, please look at the economic message and budget message that US President Truman submitted to the US Congress on January 16 and 21 this year. These messages stated that the total financial expenditure of the US government for the fiscal year from July 1 this year to June 30 next year is 85.4 billion US dollars. In this total amount, the funds directly used to expand armaments and the Korean War and the so-called "common security" are 65 billion US dollars, accounting for 76.1 percent of the total budget. If we add other expenses related to the above-mentioned military purposes, the total amount accounts for 88.4 percent of the total budget. This is a painful burden for the American people. Truman also announced that he would "reduce the use of urgently needed materials in the manufacture of many peacetime goods," so he could not but admit that "some smaller production enterprises will encounter serious problems." He also could not but admit that the US national finances had produced a "large deficit." So he asked to extend the "Defense Production Act" for another two years, asking the American people to "endure hardship" and shoulder the "heavy burden" of expanding armaments.
    Under the war policy of the US government, the remaining forces of Western Nazi Germany are being supported, and the remaining forces of Eastern militarist Japan are also being stepped up for revival. Japan's remilitarization is undoubtedly the greatest threat to the peace of the Asian and Pacific regions. The people of the Asian and Pacific regions can no longer endure another disaster of Japanese militarist aggression.
    During World War II, the war of aggression launched by Japanese militarists in the East caused unprecedented disasters in many invaded countries. It caused China to lose more than ten million lives and more than 50 billion US dollars in property. It caused more than two million Indonesian workers to die from hard labor, tens of thousands of soldiers were forced to become cannon fodder, and thousands of patriots sacrificed in Japanese prisons. It caused the people of the Philippines to die more than 1.1 million people and lose more than 5.5 billion US dollars in property. It caused Burma to lose more than 18 billion rupees in wealth. It caused more than two million Vietnamese people to die of hunger. It cut off India's food imports and starved more than 3.5 million people to death. Its bombing of Australia still left scars. And what benefits did the Japanese people get? Two million orphans and 1.83 million widows answered this question well. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by two atomic bombs, and the 4.974 billion US dollars in military occupation fees borne during the more than six years of occupation, answered this question well.
    However, the wounds of World War II have not yet fully recovered, and Japanese militarism is recovering at a rapid pace. On September 8, 1951, the San Francisco Conference signed a "Treaty of Peace with Japan" and a US-Japan "Security Treaty" without the participation of the Soviet Union, China, Mongolia, India, and Burma. On February 28 this year, the US government and the Japanese Yoshida government signed the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement." Those treaties and agreements were officially declared to have "taken effect" on April 28 this year, and at the same time, the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan were dissolved. On the same day, the Japanese Yoshida government and the Taiwan Kuomintang also signed the so-called "Japan-China Peace Treaty," openly expressing hostility to the 475 million Chinese people. Recently, on July 26, we saw the signing of a US-Japan "Facilities and Areas Agreement." It more clearly stipulates that Japan must provide a total of 612 military bases and facilities, including barracks, naval, land, and air force training grounds, airports, and naval bases, of which 300 are for the permanent use of the US military. The density of these military bases and facilities has reached one per 600 square kilometers. Under conditions that completely violate international agreements, the Japanese armed forces have been stepped up for expansion and equipment, and more than 184,000 Japanese war criminals have been released or re-employed, and the germ warfare criminal Shiro Ishii and others have already participated in the germ warfare against Korea and Northeast China. The ban on Japan's manufacture of military materials and weapons has been lifted, so a large number of bombs, napalm bombs, etc. manufactured by Japan have been used to destroy peaceful cities in Korea and massacre peaceful residents in Korea.
    In order to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism and organize the so-called "Pacific Pact" group with Japan as its core, the "US, Australia, and New Zealand Council" held its first meeting in Honolulu from August 4 to 6 under the auspices of the US government. The US government, at this meeting, put forward a plan to establish a "Pacific Pact" similar to the "North Atlantic Treaty" with Japan as its core, whose "military responsibility scope" would "extend from the Bering Strait through the Aleutian Islands, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Australia to New Zealand," and with Korea as "an outpost" of this "scope." The countries convening this meeting completely disregarded the voices of the people of Southeast Asia and Australia against the revival of Japanese militarism, and placed the entire Southeast Asia and Australia under the threat of Japanese militarist aggression again.
    Japan's ruling clique has long been scheming to make a comeback, and now, under the protection and instigation of the US occupation forces, they are starting to relive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere." Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida gave a speech on August 4 to the heads of the disguised Japanese military department—the "National Safety Agency" headquarters. He declared that "the establishment of the National Safety Agency is to organize a new army," and "the United States hopes that Japan will lead Asia," so he expressed his determination to "answer the hopes of the United States." This expression of determination is very obvious, and we have long seen it from the facts. We have seen that Japan's budget this year has increased by 30 percent compared to last year, and direct and indirect military spending has reached 70 percent of the total budget. But at the same time, we have also seen that Japan's peaceful industry has suffered great destruction, and more than 6,700 small and medium-sized enterprises have been forced to go bankrupt; the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in Japan has reached 18 million. According to materials from the Japanese Ministry of Labor, in the second half of 1951, there were 658 cases of workers and farmers registering to sell their children; it is unknown how many were unregistered. According to a report in the "Asahi Shimbun," there were 22,622 suicides in Japan in 1951. This is the evil result of Yoshida's government "answering the hopes of the United States." However, they do not care about the life or death of the Japanese people, but are wholeheartedly running wildly to reorganize their military and want to dominate Asia again.
    Delegates, look, under this war policy of the US government, isn't the change in the situation in the Asian and Pacific regions a bit pressing? This situation has shocked the peace-loving people of the Asian and Pacific regions and has also shocked the good people who love peace all over the world. However, the US government and its generals cannot be satisfied. Recently, some people have publicly declared that they want to establish an army with "strong offensive potential" to "liberate" all people's democratic countries. If we allow this dangerous situation to develop, what kind of disaster will the people of the Asian and Pacific regions and the people of the world suffer? Isn't it as clear as fire?
    Delegates, we people of the Asian and Pacific regions have fresh memories of the war disasters we have suffered in the past, and we can no longer tolerate the threat of new wars. Our demands are the same as those of peace-loving people all over the world. Everyone must work hard to strive for and defend peace.
    Here, please allow me to cite examples from several countries to illustrate.
    First of all, please allow me to especially introduce the efforts of the Japanese people to strive for peace. Although the Japanese ruling clique, under the support of the United States, is enthusiastically reviving militarism, the Japanese people are firmly opposed to it. On May Day this year, the large-scale parade of 4 million people across Japan most powerfully expressed the Japanese people's firm will to oppose slavery and oppose the revival of militarism. The words of Takahashi Masao, a trade union member who was injured and died in the parade, and his mother touched the hearts of the people of the world. Takahashi Masao's mother said sadly at the founding meeting of the Tokyo Mothers' Association: "I found an application in my son's bag, writing 'We want freedom, we want peace, we want human life.' As his mother, I want to realize my son's wishes." This is just one example of thousands of Japanese mothers. There is no doubt that the Japanese people's heroic struggle for peace is linked to their struggle for national independence, freedom, and democracy. Their just struggle will surely receive the full support of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions and even the people of the world who love peace and justice.
    Secondly, in the United States, we have also seen that since the "New York Peace Conference" held in March 1949, the movement to strive for peace has gradually spread throughout the United States. Peace-loving people from all walks of life in the United States, including famous American atomic scientists Professor Philip Morrison and Professor Oliver Lawford, have signed the Stockholm Declaration. After the US government's armed intervention in the Korean War broke out, the American people have constantly protested against the US government's policy. The "American National Peace Conference," which represents the common demands of trade unions, farmers' groups, church groups, and writers, scientists, and artists from 48 states in the United States, put forward proposals such as completely restoring peace in Korea and immediately holding negotiations between major powers when it was held last June, fully demonstrating that the American people and the people of all countries in the world are one family in the struggle to defend peace, and we should unite more closely.
    In Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines, the people clearly recognize that their struggle against aggression and for national independence is an inseparable part of the Asian and Pacific regions and the world's peace movement; at the same time, the growing peace movement in the Asian and Pacific regions and the world is one of the important factors helping their struggle to achieve victory as soon as possible. Therefore, they not only actively and heroically continue to implement the struggle against aggression and for independence, but also enthusiastically and on a large scale respond to and participate in the movement to defend peace.
    In various countries in the Southeast Asian region, we have seen that the people's movement to defend peace has been launched very universally throughout the country. Take India as an example, under the call of the "All India Peace Conference," the Indian people's peace movement has been constantly advancing since 1949. The All India Trade Union Congress, the Progressive Writers' Association, students, women, farmers' groups, and prominent social figures have all participated in the great wave of defending peace. In Indonesia, more than 500,000 Indonesian people signed the Stockholm Declaration, and by April 1952, the number of people who signed the declaration supporting the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers had exceeded 600,000. In Burma, organizations to defend peace have been established in major and minor cities, counties, and many villages across the country; in May this year, Burmese peace fighters also held a All Burma Congress for the Defense of World Peace and a large-scale demonstration parade to defend peace. In Pakistan, more than 50,000 people participated in the most recent peace conference in Lahore, reflecting the people's eager desire for peace and their willingness to participate in peace gatherings.
    In Thailand and Ceylon, the peace movement has also gained widespread support from people from all walks of life.
    In the Middle East and Near East countries, people know how to combine their struggle for national independence and democratic freedom with the struggle for peace.
    Under the leadership of peace defense organizations in Australia and New Zealand, the struggle to defend peace is unfolding in various ways in various aspects.
    In the Americas, in March this year, American peace fighters overcame serious difficulties and convened the Second American Continental Peace Conference in the capital of Uruguay, summarized the experience of the American peace movement, and pointed out the tasks of the American peace movement in the future. In Canada, the peace movement is developing day by day.
    In Mongolia, all adults, regardless of their beliefs, signed the Stockholm Declaration and the declaration supporting the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers. The Mongolian people are working hard for peaceful construction.
    In the Soviet Union, the struggle for peace has always illuminated the history of the Soviet Union; the movement to defend peace has always been regarded by the Soviet government and people as the most sacred and great cause. Under the leadership of the Soviet government, the Soviet people are not only actively and enthusiastically participating in the peace movement, but are also creating their own beautiful life and defending world peace through large-scale peaceful labor. The power of the people produces many miracles. The post-war five-year plan has been completed ahead of schedule, and a new five-year plan has been implemented since 1951, making the lives of the Soviet people full of peace and happiness. Just in terms of water conservancy, the Soviet people completed the huge construction project of the Volga-Don Canal named after Lenin in a very short period of time. They are building the world's largest irrigation system and hundreds of powerful pumping stations and mechanical irrigation equipment, preparing to irrigate more than 28 million hectares of deserts, semi-deserts, and arid areas. This is absolutely impossible for those countries that are preparing to provoke war.
    In China, we have seen that the people liberated themselves after a long and arduous struggle. Because of their personal experience, they understand the value of peace most. Therefore, they regard defending the peace of the Far East and the world as their primary responsibility and glorious task. More than 340 million Chinese people signed the declaration supporting the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers. On the one hand, they are continuing to work tirelessly to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and restore and defend peace in the Far East; on the other hand, they are more wholeheartedly engaged in peaceful construction, making their lives prosperous. In the past three years, just in terms of various water conservancy projects, the amount of earthwork excavated is more than ten times more than when the Panama Canal was built and more than twenty-three times more than when the Suez Canal was built. If these earthworks were built into a dike one meter high and one meter wide, they could encircle the equator forty-three times. Due to the realization of various democratic reforms, and due to the extremely high enthusiasm of Chinese workers, farmers, and other working people in the patriotic increase production and practice economy movement, China's industry and agriculture have been rapidly restored and developed. The output of major industrial and agricultural products has exceeded the highest record in Chinese history. The national finances for 1951 not only achieved balance but also had a surplus. National prices are stable, people's lives have generally improved, the unemployment problem has been basically solved, comprehensive labor employment is about to be realized, and large-scale economic and cultural construction will be further launched.
    The facts fully show that the direction and goals of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions are consistent, and they are all for striving for and defending peace. The fact that the Soviet Union and China are vigorously engaged in peaceful construction further shows that they do not want war. Because peaceful construction and preparing for war cannot coexist. Whoever prepares for war cannot carry out peaceful construction. This is very common sense. The Soviet Union and China have repeatedly expressed their warm desire for peace, and in various international conferences, they have repeatedly proposed and supported suggestions to consolidate international peace and security. They have proven by action that they and countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully.
    In the long-term comparison of situations, the people of the world have gradually understood the truth of the facts. Everyone feels the threat of military expansion and the restrictions of blockades and embargoes, so they unanimously pursue peace and oppose war.
    Of course, the movement to defend peace is inseparable from the struggle for national independence and freedom. Lasting peace must be based on the end of national oppression and national slavery. This truth is not only reflected in the struggle of the Japanese people, but also in the struggle of the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, and in the struggle of the people of all countries in the Middle East, Near East, North Africa, and other places where national independence is being ravaged and national sovereignty is being infringed. Replacing slavery with friendship, replacing violence with consultation, replacing war with peace, not invading others, and not being invaded by others, helping each other in peaceful construction to reduce human disasters and increase international security, isn't all this worthy of the common efforts of peace-loving mankind?
    Precious life is a very natural requirement of people. So despite the fact that war mongers are calling for human self-slaughter, such as recently someone saying such words: "Letting Asians slaughter Asians is a shortcut to establishing peace." However, several of the prisoners of war who dropped germ bombs in Korea frankly admitted that they were suffering from pangs of conscience. The facts are before us. The peace-loving people of Asia, the people of the Pacific region, and even the people of the world will not so easily slaughter each other. Although some people are stepping up the arming of West Germany, it is the West German people who are strongly opposed to the arming of West Germany. Although some people are stepping up the arming of Japan, it is the Japanese people who are strongly opposed to the arming of Japan. We believe that those who regard human self-slaughter as convenient as cockfighting and dogfighting and obtain excessive profits from it are bound to fail.
    Delegates, "Peace cannot be waited for; peace needs peace-loving people to unite and strive for it." This is a famous saying in the declaration of the preparatory meeting. Since we understand the demands of the people, accept the entrustment of the people, and participate in such a historically significant Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, we have the responsibility to put forward some concrete proposals on the various issues threatening the security of this region, based on the declaration and proposals of the preparatory meeting. Now I would like to submit five requests to the conference, which have been preliminarily discussed during the preparatory period, and request the conference to discuss and adopt them.
    1. We demand a comprehensive solution to the Japanese issue and to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism. This is to conclude a peace treaty with Japan in accordance with the principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter, the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Proclamation and Agreement; to withdraw all foreign occupation forces stationed in Japan; to support the Japanese people's right to independence, peace, and democracy, and under such conditions, to agree that the Japanese people enjoy armed forces for self-defense.
    2. We demand that necessary steps be taken to achieve a fair and reasonable end to the wars in Korea and other places. This is to implement the armistice in Korea in accordance with all the terms of the agreement that have already been reached in the Korean armistice negotiations, in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, to unconditionally repatriate all prisoners of war, to stop all indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities, peaceful construction, and peaceful residents; to withdraw all foreign troops in Korea, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, and to let the Korean people solve their own internal affairs. Conflicts in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Malaya, and other places, as well as unrest in the Near East, Middle East, and other regions, must also be resolved peacefully under fair and reasonable principles. No country shall interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, the national independence of these countries should be respected, and their domestic problems should be solved by themselves.
    3. We demand that the five major powers, the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and China, conclude a peace treaty, implement international disarmament, and prohibit the use of atomic weapons, germ weapons, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction; we demand that the governments of all countries ratify and effectively implement the "Protocol on the Prohibition of the Use of Poisonous Gases or Similar Gases and Bacteriological Methods of Warfare" concluded in Geneva on June 17, 1925; and we demand condemnation of crimes of mistreating and massacring prisoners of war and civilians.
    4. We demand that the national independence of all countries be guaranteed, that no country infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries' territories, territorial waters, and airspaces, and that no military bases be established in other countries; that the people of all countries have the freedom to choose their own political system and way of life, and that they can fully develop fair trade and cultural exchanges between the people of all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully and should respect each other. We demand the immediate cessation of the implementation of any international blockade, embargo, and monopoly policies.
    5. We demand that the clamor about war and the propaganda of racial hatred be prohibited, that discrimination against colored people be eliminated, and that all suppression of the peace movement be abolished. The people of all countries should have the freedom to participate in the peace movement, and the people of all countries who have suffered persecution for participating in the peace movement should be guaranteed the right to open appeals and enjoy freedom.
    Delegates, we believe that these are the common demands of the sixteen hundred million people of the Asian and Pacific regions. Peace-loving people all over the world are supporting us, and we have the responsibility to persevere in the struggle to realize these demands. Our cause is just. Realizing these demands will guarantee a lasting and just peace in the Asian and Pacific regions, and will further guarantee a lasting and just peace in the world. Countless experiences prove that people's good wishes must be realized through their own efforts. Therefore, in order to stop war, defend peace, and realize our wishes, we call on the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, and we call on the people of the world, regardless of nationality, occupation, class, political views, religious beliefs, and lifestyles, to unite more widely and closely, to take active action, and to make long-term efforts. Although the threat of war is becoming more and more serious, the warmongers who betray human reason are only a very small number of people after all. As long as we unite as one and persevere in the struggle for the cause of peace, replace the settlement of disputes by force with a spirit of consultation, replace blockade and monopoly with equality and mutual benefit, and replace national slavery with mutual friendship, we will have the power to make peace triumph over war!

    团结一心，保卫和平
    ——在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第二日会议上的报告
    中国代表团副团长  郭沫若
    主席、各位女士、各位先生：
    今天亚洲及太平洋区域各国的十六亿人民，把他们对于亚洲、太平洋区域与全世界的和平的崇高愿望，寄托于我们在这里所召开的和平会议。这使我们深切地感觉到我们每个代表为和平事业而奋斗的责任和这个和平会议所具有的历史意义。
    自从本年六月三日至六日举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议闭幕以后，亚洲、澳洲及美洲沿太平洋各国的人民都积极地行动了起来，热烈地拥护筹备会议的宣言和关于各项筹备工作的提议，并踊跃选出自己的代表，来举行现在的这个亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。这就充分地表明本区域十六亿人民，和全世界善良的人民一样，要求和平的愿望是怎样的殷切。
    当我们接受到本国人民的付托，来参加这个会议的时候，我们每个人的记忆里都会有着非常鲜明的印象。那就是在千百万和平的家庭中，慈爱的父母，天真的子女，年轻的夫妇们所表示的共同的要求。他们要求每个人都能够免除战争的恐惧和忧虑，安宁地过着和平的生活，以便在可能的条件下，使生活变得更美满一些。他们对于和平生活的这种善良的愿望，使每一个有良心的人都不能不受到深切的感动。
    然而，战争的魔影却偏偏要来威胁我们。而且这威胁现在是愈来愈严重了，使我们不能不紧急地动员起来从事和平的保卫。
    各位代表，今天人们都清楚地看到，在我们的区域里面，朝鲜的战火已经燃烧了两年多，停战谈判也进行到一年多了。人们都渴望停止朝鲜战争，以便为和平解决朝鲜问题及远东其他问题开辟道路。然而在停战谈判期间，在朝鲜和中国东北和平的居民却蒙受了违反人道的细菌战的毒害。这一骇人听闻的罪行，最近又由六个国家——英国、法国、意大利、瑞典、苏联、巴西的公正科学家们所组成的国际科学委员会的调查所证实了。同时，朝中边界鸭绿江上的发电站及朝鲜北部的和平建设、和平城市与和平居民也不断遭受着疯狂的轰炸；在巨济岛、釜山、济州岛等地战俘营中的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员也不断地被大批屠杀。停战谈判继续被拖延下来，时时遭受蛮横的阻挠，朝鲜的战争还有继续延长与扩大的危险。这就造成了对亚洲及太平洋区域和平的直接的严重的威胁。
    各位代表，我们是看得很清楚的，美国政府及其将军们违反了美国人民的愿望，违犯了世界各国包括美国在内曾一致签订的国际协定，背弃了华盛顿、杰斐逊、林肯的传统，而努力奉行着战争政策，这已经是丝毫也不能掩饰的事实了。他们不断地在加紧战争宣传，并在各方面疯狂地进行着破坏和平挑拨战争的活动。他们已经组成了“北大西洋公约”集团，又正在酝酿组织“太平洋公约”集团和中东集团。他们极力制造着国际的紧张局势，制造着新的战争危险。
    在美国政府的战争政策之下，许多国家的内政受到外国的干涉，外国的军事基地不断地在亚洲东部和南部、澳洲、美洲、近东、中东、北非及欧洲西部的各国扩张着。许多国家没有获得真正的民族独立，或者是独立主权在遭受着日益严重的侵犯。从东南亚洲各国的情形来说，美国垄断资本已控制了许多重要的经济命脉，并且不断制造藉口，企图在这些国家中攫取更多的特权。因之，美国政府对这些国家的政治上以及军事上的许多狂暴的干涉也就接踵而来了。美国还在援助其他国家对东南亚各国如越南、马来亚的武装干涉行动，并且极力挑拨亚洲各国之间及各国内部各个民族之间的冲突，散播种族歧视、宗教纠纷与不和的种子。至于中东诸国，如伊朗、土耳其、伊拉克、叙利亚与黎巴嫩等，也受着美国不等价贸易的摧残，工农业日益衰落，贸易和收支发生巨额的逆差，使国家财政陷于困境。通货膨胀和物价高涨的结果，使生活指数猛烈上升，以一九五一年与战前相比，伊朗为百分之七百五十，土耳其为百分之五百，伊拉克为百分之四百。这就促使亚洲各国人民不能不首先起来反对美国的战争政策。在美国政府的战争政策之下，美国的军事预算达到了天文数字般的庞大。远的且不必说，请看今年一月十六日和二十一日，美国杜鲁门总统先后向美国国会提出的经济咨文和预算咨文吧。这些咨文提出：美国政府从今年七月一日到明年六月三十日为止的这个会计年度内，全部财政支出为八百五十四亿美元。在这个总数中，规定着直接用于扩充军备和朝鲜战争的费用以及所谓“共同安全”的经费，是六百五十亿美元，占全部预算的百分之七十六点一。如果再加上其他与上述军事目的有关的开支，总数共占全部预算的百分之八十八点四。这对于美国人民是一个沉重的痛苦的负担。杜鲁门同时宣布了还要“减少急需物资在制造许多和平时期物品方面的使用”，因此他不能不承认“某些规模较小的生产企业将遇到严重的问题”。他也不能不承认美国的国家财政已经产生了“大量赤字”。于是他要求把“国防生产法”再延长两年，要求美国人民“忍受困难”，并且挑起扩充军备的“沉重的担子”。
    在美国政府的战争政策之下，西方纳粹德国的残余势力正被扶植起来，东方军国主义日本的残余势力同样正被加紧复活。日本的重新军国主义化对于亚洲及太平洋区域的和平，无疑地是最大的威胁。亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民决不能再忍受一次日本军国主义侵略的灾害了。
    第二次世界大战时期，日本军国主义者在东方发动的侵略战争，在许多被侵略的国家中是造成了空前的灾难的。它使中国人民损失了一千万以上的生命和五百亿美元以上的财产。它使印尼二百万以上的劳动者死于劳役，十几万士兵被迫去当炮灰，千百志士牺牲在日军监狱之中。它使菲律宾人民死亡了一百一十多万人，财物损失了五十五亿美元以上。它使缅甸损失了一百八十几亿卢比的财富。它使二百多万的越南人民因饥饿而死亡。它使印度的粮食进口断绝，饿死了三百五十多万人。它对澳大利亚的轰炸，至今还留下了创痕。而在日本人民方面又受到了什么好处呢？两百万的孤儿和一百八十三万的寡妇，很好地回答了这个问题。广岛和长崎所遭受的两枚原子弹的轰炸，被占领的六年多的期间所担负了的四十九亿七千四百万美元的军事占领费，很好地回答了这个问题。
    然而第二次世界大战的创伤还没有完全恢复转来，而日本的军国主义却采取迅速的步调恢复转来了。一九五一年九月八日旧金山会议签订了没有苏联、中国、蒙古、印度和缅甸参加的“对日和约”及美日“安全条约”。今年二月二十八日美国政府又和日本吉田政府签订了美日“行政协定”。那些条约和协定，在今年四月二十八日已被宣布正式“生效”，同时并宣布解散远东委员会和盟国对日委员会。日本的吉田政府和台湾国民党也在这同一天签订了所谓“日华和约”，公开表示与四亿七千五百万的中国人民为敌。最近，七月二十六日，我们又看见了一项美、日“设施和区域协定”的签订。它更明白规定日本必须提供营房、海陆空军演习场、飞机场、海军基地等军事基地和军事设施共六百十二处，其中三百处是供美军永久使用的。这种军事基地和军事设施，其密度竟达到每六百平方公里一处。在完全违背国际协定的条件下，日本的武装部队已被加紧扩充与装备起来，日本的战争罪犯已有十八万四千余名被释放或起用，细菌战犯石井四郎等人早已经参加了对朝鲜和中国东北的细菌战了。日本制造军火和武器的禁令已被解除，因而已经有大批由日本制造的炸弹、凝固汽油弹等被用来毁灭朝鲜的和平城市，屠杀朝鲜的和平居民。
    为了加速复活日本军国主义，组织以日本为核心的所谓“太平洋公约”集团，今年八月四日至六日，在美国政府主持下的“美、澳、新理事会”曾经在檀香山开了第一次会议。美国政府在这个会议上，提出了建立一个和“北大西洋公约”相类似的以日本为核心的“太平洋公约”计划，它的“军事责任范围”要“从白令海峡经阿留申群岛、日本、台湾、菲律宾、澳大利亚到新西兰”，而以朝鲜为这个“范围”的“一个前哨”。召集这个会议的国家完全不顾东南亚洲和澳洲各国人民反对复活日本军国主义的呼声，而把整个东南亚洲和澳洲各国重新放在日本军国主义的侵略威胁之下了。
    日本的统治集团早就处心积虑地想死灰复燃，现在他们在美国占领军的卵翼和唆使之下，又开始在重温着“大东亚共荣圈”的老梦了。日本首相吉田茂，在八月四日曾向变相的日本军部——“保安厅”总部的头领们发表演说，他宣称“保安厅的成立是为了组织一支新的陆军”，“美国希望领导亚洲的是日本”，因此他表示决心要“回答美国的希望”。这种决心的表示是很明显的，我们早就从事实中看出了。我们看到日本今年的预算比起去年来又增加了百分之三十，而直接和间接军费竟达到预算总额的百分之七十。但同时我们也看到日本的和平工业遭受到极大的摧残，有六千七百多家中小企业业已被迫破产；日本人民的失业者和半失业者已经达到一千八百万人。根据日本劳动省的材料，一九五一年下半年，工人、农民登记出卖子女者有六百五十八起；未经登记的还不知道有多少。又根据“朝日新闻”的报道，一九五一年日本的自杀者为两万二千六百二十二人。这就是吉田政府为了“回答美国的希望”所造成的恶果。然而他们不管日本人民的死活，却死心踏地为重整军备而狂奔，想重新来称霸亚洲。
    各位代表，请看，在美国政府的这种战争政策之下，亚洲及太平洋区域的形势的改变，不是有点咄咄逼人吗？这形势已经使亚洲及太平洋区域爱好和平的人民都受到了震惊，也使全世界爱好和平的善良人民都受到了震惊。然而美国政府及其将军们还不能满足，最近竟有人在公开宣称要建立具有“强大的进击潜力”的军队，来“解放”一切人民民主国家。如果听任这种危险的形势发展下去，那末，亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，全世界的人民，会遭受到怎样的灾难，不是明如观火的吗？
    各位代表，我们亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民对过去所受的战争灾难记忆犹新，我们再也不能忍受新战争的威胁了。我们的要求和全世界爱好和平人民的要求是一致的。大家都要努力来争取和保卫和平。
    在这里请允许我举出若干国家的例子来做说明吧。
    首先，请允许我特别介绍日本人民争取和平的努力。日本的统治集团尽管在美国的扶植之下，热狂地复活着军国主义，但日本人民是坚决反对的。今年五一劳动节，在日本全国有四百万人的大规模游行，最有力地表示了日本人民反对奴役和反对军国主义复活的坚强意志。在游行中受到弹压因伤致死的工会会员高桥正雄和他母亲的话打动着世界人民的心弦。高桥正雄的母亲在东京母亲会成立大会上悲愤地说：“我从我儿子的衣包里搜到了一通申请书，写着‘要自由，要和平，要有人的生活’，作为他的母亲，我要实现我儿子的愿望。”这是千千万万日本母亲中之一例。毫无疑问，日本人民为争取和平而进行的英勇斗争，和他们争取国家的独立、自由、民主的斗争是连在一起的。他们的正义斗争，必将得到亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，乃至全世界爱好和平与正义的人民的全力支持。
    其次，在美国，我们也看到从一九四九年三月召开的“纽约和平大会”以来，争取和平的运动就在美国各地逐渐开展起来。美国各阶层爱好和平的人们，包括美国著名的原子科学家费里普·莫里逊教授，奥立佛尔·拉吴法教授等，都在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。在美国政府武装干涉朝鲜的战争爆发以后，美国人民对于美国政府的政策不断地提出抗议。代表美国四十八州的各业工会、农民团体、教会团体和作家、科学家、艺术家们的共同要求的“美国全国和平大会”，在去年六月召开的时候，提出了完全恢复朝鲜和平、立即举行大国谈判等项主张，充分地表明了美国人民和全世界各国人民，在保卫和平的斗争中是一家人，我们应该更加紧密地团结在一起。
    在朝鲜、越南、马来亚、菲律宾，人民清楚地认识到：他们反对侵略和争取民族独立的斗争，本身就是亚洲及太平洋区域和世界保卫和平运动的不可分割的部分；同时，日益壮大的亚洲及太平洋区域和世界保卫和平运动，又是帮助他们的斗争早日获得胜利的重大因素之一。因此，他们不仅积极英勇地继续贯彻反对侵略争取独立的斗争，而且还热烈地大规模地响应和参加保卫和平的运动。
    在东南亚地区各国，我们看到人们保卫和平的运动很普遍地在全国范围内展开了。拿印度来说，在“全印和平大会”的号召之下，印度人民的和平运动，从一九四九年以来，不断地向前推进。全印工会大会、进步作家协会、学生、妇女、农民团体和社会著名人士，都参加到保卫和平的伟大浪潮里来了。在印度尼西亚，印尼人民在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的达五十多万人，到一九五二年四月，在拥护五大国缔结和平公约宣言上签名的业已超过了六十万人。在缅甸，保卫和平的组织业已在全国各大中小城市、各县及许多乡村中建立了起来；本年五月，缅甸的和平战士们还举行了一次全缅甸的保卫世界和平代表大会和一次保卫和平示威大游行。在巴基斯坦，仅仅在拉合尔这个古老城市的最近一次和平大会中，就有五万多人参加，反映了人民要求和平的殷切愿望和愿意参加和平集会的热烈情绪。
    在泰国和锡兰，和平运动也获得了各阶层人民广泛的拥护。
    在中东、近东各国，人民知道如何将他们争取民族独立与民主自由的斗争与争取和平的斗争结合起来。
    在澳洲和新西兰保卫和平机构的领导之下，保卫和平的斗争正在各个不同的方面以各种不同的方式展开。
    在美洲，今年三月间，美洲的和平战士们突破了严重困难，在乌拉圭京城召开了第二届美洲大陆和平会议，总结了美洲和平运动的经验，指出了今后美洲和平运动的任务。在加拿大，和平运动正在一天比一天开展。
    在蒙古，全体成年人，不问其信仰如何，都在斯德哥尔摩宣言和拥护五大国缔结和平公约宣言上签了名。蒙古人民正在为和平建设而努力奋斗。
    在苏联，争取和平的斗争一直照耀着苏联的历史；保卫和平的运动，一直被苏联政府和人民认为是最神圣伟大的事业。苏联人民在苏联政府领导之下，不仅在积极热烈地参加和平运动，而且正以大规模的和平劳动来创造着自己的美好生活，并保卫着世界和平。人民的力量产生着不少的奇迹。战后的五年计划已经提前完成了，并从一九五一年开始又在实行着新的五年计划，使苏联人民的生活充满着和平幸福，仅仅以水利一项来说，苏联人民在很短的时间内完成了以列宁命名的伏尔加—顿运河的巨大的建设工程。他们正在建设世界上最大的灌溉系统和成百个强大的抽水站及机械灌溉设备，准备灌溉两千八百万公顷以上的沙漠、半沙漠和干旱地区。这绝不是那些准备挑动战争的国家所能够做到的。
    在中国，我们看到人民经过长期艰苦的斗争而解放了自己，他们由于亲身的体验，最了解和平的可贵。因此，他们把保卫远东与世界和平看做是自己的首要责任和光荣任务。中国人民在拥护五大国缔结和平公约宣言上签名的超过了三亿四千万。他们一方面正在继续不屈不挠地为和平解决朝鲜问题、恢复和保卫远东和平而斗争；另一方面，更在一心一意地从事和平建设，使自己的生活欣欣向荣。三年来只就各种水利工程来说，挖掘土方的数量，就比凿巴拿马运河时多出十倍以上，比凿苏彝士运河时多出二十三倍以上。这些土方，如果筑成一道一公尺高一公尺宽的长堤，可以环绕赤道四十三周。由于各种民主改革的实现，由于中国的工人、农民及其他劳动人民以极高度的热情卷起了爱国增产节约运动，中国的工业和农业已经迅速地恢复并发展了起来。主要工业品和农业品的产量，都已超过了中国历史上的最高纪录。一九五一年度的国家财政不但达到了平衡，而且还有结余。全国物价稳定，人民生活普遍上升，失业问题已经基本解决，全面的劳动就业即将实现，大规模的经济和文化建设就要进一步展开。
    事实完全说明，亚洲及太平洋各国人民努力的方向和目标是一致的，都是为了争取与保卫和平。苏联和中国在大力从事和平建设的事实更说明了他们不要战争。因为和平建设与准备战争是不能并立的。谁要是准备战争，谁就不能够进行和平建设。这是很普通的常识。苏联和中国都已经再三表示了他们对于和平的热烈愿望，在各种国际会议中，他们都屡次提出和拥护巩固国际和平与安全的建议。他们已经用行动来证明了他们和其他社会制度不同的国家是能够和平共处的。
    在长期的形势对比中，世界人民已经逐渐地明了到事实的真相了。大家都感受着扩军备战的威胁和封锁禁运的限制，因而也就一致追求和平而反对战争。
    当然，保卫和平的运动与争取民族独立与自由的斗争是分不开来的。持久的和平必须建基在民族压迫与民族奴役的结束之上。这一真理不仅表现在日本人民的斗争中，同时也表现在亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的斗争中，表现在中东、近东、北非等地所有民族独立受着蹂躏、国家主权受着侵犯的各国人民的斗争中。使友好代替奴役，使协商代替暴力，使和平代替战争，不侵略别人，也不受别人侵略，在和平建设中，有无相助，以减少人类的灾难，增进国际的安全，难道这一切值不得爱好和平的人类来共同努力吗？
    宝贵生命，本是人们很自然的要求。所以尽管战争野心家们在以人类自相屠杀相号召，如最近竟有人说出了这样的话：“让亚洲人屠杀亚洲人是建立和平的捷径”。然而在朝鲜投过细菌弹的战俘们，却有好几个人坦白地承认，他们在受着良心的责备。事实摆在我们的面前，爱好和平的亚洲人民，太平洋区域人民乃至全世界人民是不会那样轻易地自相屠杀的。尽管有人在加紧武装西德，而极力反对武装西德的却就是西德人民。尽管有人在加紧武装日本，而极力反对武装日本的却就是日本人民。把人类的自相屠杀，看成像斗鸡斗狗一样轻便而从中取得超额利润的人们，我们相信他们是必然要失败的。
    各位代表，“和平不能坐待，和平需要爱好和平的人民团结起来争取”，这是筹备会议宣言里面的一句名言。我们既体会着人民的要求，接受着人民的委托，参加了这样一次有历史意义的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，我们有责任对于威胁着本区域安全的各项问题，根据筹备会议的宣言和提议，提出一些具体的主张。我现在仅就在筹备期中经过初步协商的五项要求，向大会提出，请求大会讨论并加以采纳。
    一、我们要求全面解决日本问题，制止日本军国主义的复活。这就是按照联合国宪章、开罗宣言、雅尔塔协定、波茨坦公告和协定所规定的原则，缔结对日和约；撤退驻留日本的一切外国占领军；支持日本人民取得独立、和平、民主的权利，在这样的条件之下，并同意日本人民享有自卫的武装力量。
    二、我们要求采取必要的步骤，使朝鲜等地的战争得到公平合理的结束。这就是按照朝鲜停战谈判已经取得协议的全部条款，按照日内瓦各项公约，无条件地遣返全部战俘，实现朝鲜停战；停止一切对和平城市、和平建设与和平居民的滥施轰炸；撤退在朝鲜的一切外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军在内，让朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜的内政问题。在越南、寮国、高棉、马来亚等地的冲突，在近东、中东及其他地区的不安，也必须在公平合理的原则之下求得和平解决。任何国家都不得干涉别的国家的内政，这些国家的民族独立应该受到尊重，他们的国内问题应由他们自己解决。
    三、我们要求美、英、法、苏、中五大国缔结和平公约，实行国际裁军，禁止使用原子武器、细菌武器、化学武器及其他大量杀人武器；要求一切国家的政府批准并切实履行一九二五年六月十七日在日内瓦订立的“关于禁用毒气或类似毒气及细菌方法作战议定书”；并要求谴责虐待与屠杀战俘及平民的罪行。
    四、我们要求保障各国人民的民族独立，任何国家不得侵犯别国的领土、领海、领空等主权，不得在别国内建立军事基地；各国人民都有自由选择自己认为满意的政治制度和生活方式，并能在平等互利的基础上，充分发展各国人民之间的公平贸易与文化交流。各种社会制度不同的国家是可以和平共处的，是应当相互尊重的。我们要求立即停止任何国际的封锁、禁运与垄断政策的执行。
    五、我们要求禁止关于战争的叫嚣和种族仇恨的宣传，取消对于有色人种的歧视，取消一切对和平运动的压制。各国人民都应有参加和平运动的自由权，各国因参加和平运动而遭受迫害的人们，应获得公开申诉和享受自由的保证。
    各位代表，这些，我们相信，是亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民的共同要求。全世界爱好和平的人民都在支持着我们，我们有责任为实现这些要求而坚持奋斗。我们的事业是正义的。实现了这些要求，就能保障亚洲及太平洋区域的持久、公正的和平，也就能进一步保障世界的持久、公正的和平。无数的经验证明，人们的善良愿望，要变成美好的现实，是必须经过人们自己的努力去争取的。因此，为了制止战争，保卫和平，实现我们的愿望，我们号召全亚洲及太平洋区域的各国人民，并号召全世界的人民，不分民族、职业、阶层、政治见解、宗教信仰和生活方式，更加广泛地亲密地一致团结，积极行动起来，作长期的努力。尽管战争的威胁愈来愈严重，然而背叛人类理智的好战者毕竟只是极少数的人，只要我们团结成一条心，坚持不懈地为和平事业而奋斗，以协商精神代替武力解决，以平等互利代替封锁垄断，以相互友好代替民族奴役，我们就有力量使和平战胜战争！
