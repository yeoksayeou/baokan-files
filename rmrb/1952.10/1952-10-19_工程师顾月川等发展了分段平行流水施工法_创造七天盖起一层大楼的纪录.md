Engineer Gu Yuechuan and others from the North Construction Site of a certain Engineering Office of the First Engineering Company of the Northeast Industrial Department, learned from advanced Soviet construction experience and developed a segmented parallel assembly line construction method. Beginning in early September, they achieved the feat of building one story of a building in seven days at the 524109 project construction area. The entire 5,800-plus square meter, two-building, three-story structure in this area was completed with a construction period shortened by 71 percent compared to the original plan (110 days).

The 524109 project was an additional task decided by a certain factory at the end of August this year; due to the urgent need, it was decided to complete it this year. However, if the past working methods were followed, it would not be possible to complete the project this year, even if construction could be carried out in the severe winter. Faced with such a serious task, all the staff at the construction site did not bow their heads and actively sought ways to overcome the difficulties. Gu Yuechuan, the engineer in charge of the construction site, and others first carefully studied the superior principles of segmented construction and parallel assembly line operations in advanced Soviet construction management methods, and carefully studied the advantages of the segmented stepped continuous operation method, then integrated and improved them. Finally, they created a new segmented parallel assembly line construction method, which shortened the construction period, improved quality, and solved this serious difficulty.

The basic characteristics of this segmented parallel assembly line construction method are: 1. The entire project is divided into segments for construction; 2. Assembly line circulation between segments; 3. Parallel operation between processes; 4. Interlocking gears between trades.

That is, first divide the entire project construction area into several segments, then formulate instruction charts, and fix various labor forces according to planned needs. Secondly, start construction in sequence, circulate upwards, and carry out parallel operations. For example, the intersecting parallelism between carpentry and bricklaying is as follows: when the bricklayer starts bricklaying, the carpenter simultaneously erects formwork supports and doorways; when the bricklayer moves to the second segment after砌到the doorway, the carpenter follows up by finishing the windows and then erecting the second segment of formwork supports; when the bricklayer turns back to brick above the windows, the carpenter simultaneously supports the beams; when the bricklayer砌到平口砌the first floor, the carpenter only needs a short time to complete all the formwork supports. In the work process, the scaffolding is used inside, so the vacant time occupied by non-direct construction operations can be eliminated. In addition, parallel construction was also organized for tying steel bars and installing electrical conduits. Thirdly, trades are organized to form interlocking gears, without any confusion. For example, three processes—supporting formwork, tying steel bars, and pouring concrete—can be carried out in assembly line construction on a building. Therefore, the relationship between trades, between processes, is closely coordinated, without any delay or production downtime.

The new advanced construction experience not only speeds up progress, but also strengthens mutual supervision and operation and guarantees project quality because directly related trades can operate in parallel and in assembly line construction on one section.

In addition, because every minute of operation of each trade is carried out under advanced construction methods, advanced operating experience is easily promoted. The bricklayers in the construction area of the project completely promoted double-handed mortar squeezing under the windows, and promoted the advanced Soviet mortar squeezing and scraping method at the windows. Bricklaying increased from 800 bricks in the past to 1,500 bricks, and up to 2,000 bricks for others. Carpenters, rebar workers, cement workers, and plasterers all promoted specialized division of labor in assembly line operations, guaranteeing quality. (Chang Jing)

    工程师顾月川等发展了分段平行流水施工法
    创造七天盖起一层大楼的纪录
    东北工业部第一工程公司某工程处北工地专责工程师顾月川等，学习苏联先进施工经验，发展了分段平行流水施工法，从九月初开始在五二四一○九工程工区做到了七天盖一层大楼。该工区全部五千八百多平方公尺的两幢三层大楼建筑，比按原计划（一百一十天）缩短工期百分之七十一。
    五二四一○九工程是某厂今年八月末决定追加的任务；由于需用迫急，决定今年完工。但是如果按照过去的工作方法，就算严冬可以施工，今年也是没法完成的。工地全体职工在这样严重的任务面前没有低头，积极设法克服困难；工地专责工程师顾月川等首先认真学习苏联先进施工管理方法的分段施工和平行流水作业的优越原理，并细致研究了分段阶形连续作业法的优点，然后加以综合改进，终于创造了更新的分段平行流水施工法，使工期缩短，质量提高，解决了这一严重困难。
    这种分段平行流水施工法的基本特点是：一、全部工程划分工段施工；二、工段之间流水循环；三、工序之间平行作业；四、工种之间齿轮相咬。
    这就是首先把整个工程工区划分为若干工段，然后制定指示图表，根据计划需要，固定各种劳动力。其次，依次开工循环上升并进行平行作业，如木作工程和砌砖工程之间的相交平行是这样：瓦工开始砌砖，木工就同时立模型板支柱及门口；当瓦工砌到门口转入第二段，木工又随之立完窗口并接着立第二段模型板支柱；当瓦工转回再砌窗口以上时，木工即同时支梁柁；当瓦工把第一层楼砌到平口，木工只需很短时间就将全部模型板支完了。在工作过程中，并互相利用支柱搭作里脚手，因此非直接施工操作所占用的空隙时间可根本消灭。此外，绑扎铁筋和配电管也组织了平行施工。再次，就是工种之间组成齿轮相咬，互不错乱。如支盒子板、扎铁筋、打混凝土三道工序，可以在一幢大楼上流水施工，因此工种与工种的关系，工序与工序之间，都是紧密的配合，没有任何窝工或生产的空隙时间。
    新的先进施工经验，不单是在进度方面更加快，而且由于直接相关的工种之间能以在一个工段上平行作业和流水施工，因而加强了相互间的监督操作，保证了工程质量。
    另外由于各个工种，每分钟的作业都是在先进施工方法下进行操作，因此操作方面的先进经验也便于推广。该工程工区瓦工在窗口下全部推广了双手挤浆，在窗口处推广了苏联先进的挤浆兼刮浆，砌砖由过去八百块提高到一千五百块，多者二千多块。木工、铁筋工、洋灰工、抹灰工全部推广了专业分工的流水作业，保证了质量。    （常静）
