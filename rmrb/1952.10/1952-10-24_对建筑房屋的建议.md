    Suggestions for Building Houses
    Editor: As the motherland's large-scale economic construction is about to begin, many units in major cities are starting capital construction. When various units purchase land in the suburbs or certain areas to build houses, many residents need to move, and their housing problems are to be solved by the land-purchasing units. Before the land-purchasing units find new housing for the residents, they build some temporary housing for them. After the new housing is available, the temporary housing is demolished. This expense is significant and wasteful. Therefore, I suggest that local people's governments, based on municipal construction plans, first invest in building some residential housing in certain areas, which can be rented to various construction units to temporarily house relocated residents; later, they can be rented to general residents, so the various construction units do not have to build and demolish temporary housing. This will not only save the country a sum of money, but also solve the housing problems of some residents. The above opinions are provided for relevant departments' reference.

### 对建筑房屋的建议

    对建筑房屋的建议
    编辑同志：祖国的大规模经济建设即将开始，在各大城市中有许多单位正着手基本建设。各单位在城郊或某些地区购地建房时，有许多居民需要搬家，他们的住房问题由购地单位设法解决。在购地单位没有为居民找到新住房以前，为他们盖一些临时住室，有了新住房后，再把临时住室拆去。这笔费用很大，而且浪费。因此，我建议各地人民政府根据市政建设计划，在一定地区先由政府投资，盖好一些居民住房，租给各建筑单位临时供给迁房居民居住；以后再租给一般居民，各建筑单位就不必盖、拆临时住室了。这样不但给国家节省一笔钱，也可以解决一部分居民的住房问题。以上意见提供有关部门参考。
