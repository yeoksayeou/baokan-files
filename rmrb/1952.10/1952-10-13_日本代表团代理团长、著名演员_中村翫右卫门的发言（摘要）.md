    Speech by Nakamura Kanzaburo XVII, Acting Head of the Japanese Delegation and Famous Actor (Summary)
    I am an actor, and my father and brother are also actors. I started on the stage at the age of five and have continued my acting career for forty-seven years. Together with my friend Chojuro Kawarasaki, I formed the "Zenshinza" theater troupe in 1930. Why would an actor become a peace fighter?
    As everyone knows, during the Tojo era in Japan, the Japanese people were plunged into an abyss of ignorance and misfortune. Theater, film, and all culture were deprived of freedom under the high pressure of militarism. We were forced to stage plays that promoted war. After the war, I reflected on the fact that, although I had always opposed the war in my heart, the fact that I had performed plays promoting war on the stage had harmed the people of the world and the people of Japan. I deeply felt that Japan must apologize to the people of the world! And my apology lies in resolutely dedicating myself to the cause of peace, so that war will never happen again. Gentlemen, this is by no means the case for me alone; the Japanese people are all seriously expressing their intention to do their best for the cause of peace.
    However, the joy that postwar Japan, as a democratic country, could devote itself to world peace has become a fleeting dream. The American warmongers' conspiracy to use Japan as a base for an even more ferocious war of aggression against Asia than in the Tojo era, and as a base for launching a third world war of aggression, is already being implemented. Precisely because of this, the Japanese people are now suffering from the disasters of life again. People inwardly demand healthy and vigorous films and theater, and they want to get a moment's comfort because of the hardships of life. But the warmongers skillfully use this opportunity to promote colonial culture, and paint all culture, including radio, newspapers, magazines, film, theater, art, education, and science, with pro-American and militaristic colors.
    Our Zenshinza theater troupe has produced two films from the year before last, last year, and this year. Of all the films shown in Japan last year, a total of 215 films were imported, of which 150 were American films; 15 were British, French, and Italian films, but only two were Soviet films. This is an example of the current pro-American tendency in Japan. Moreover, the film companies are now managed by war criminals who have been purged; Toho Company has expressed its opposition to China and the Soviet Union and prohibits the production of democratic films. In response, with the aim of guiding the development of national democratic films towards peace, and in cooperation with progressive filmmakers, we explained the situation during theatrical performances across the country, raised funds from the masses, and began the unprecedented task of accumulating funds from small amounts, relying on the strength of the broad masses of people from all walks of life, led by workers and peasants, and independently produced the film "No, We Want to Live!" Our ability to use the strength of the masses to produce democratic films is a huge resistance to colonialized films; therefore, we immediately suffered violent oppression. At the same time as filming began, four cinematographers disappeared, delaying the progress of the filming. They were arrested and detained for a week by the US military authorities for unfounded reasons. We have also been subjected to destruction by movie theaters and other various forces. Finally, for no apparent reason, more than a thousand policemen rushed into our residences at dawn and destroyed all the props. They opened the boxes of unexposed film, making it impossible to continue filming.
    Although we have suffered these unspeakable oppressions, the support given to us by the people has always been overwhelmingly dominant. We have cried more than once because of this enthusiasm. The masses in the factories, in their difficult lives, engaged in side jobs and sold blood in order to raise funds, and sent us the money they earned in this way. In the countryside, old women took out small paper packets from their aprons, and then took out money from the small paper packets and gave it to us, saying, "Take it and do a good job." A third-year female student from Maebashi Middle School came to my room and took out 1,000 yen as film funds, saying, "I have been saving since I was a child, preparing to study abroad when I grow up, and I saved the money in this way. I heard that the 'Zenshinza' theater troupe is going to make the best film in Japan, and now I am bringing all my savings." There are countless examples like this in our country. Moreover, the Chinese people and the Japanese in China, with friendly sincerity, sent us 300,000 yen of funds raised from distant China. I really couldn't hold back my tears. Encouraged by this, we successfully produced the film "No, We Want to Live!" and continued to produce democratic films such as "As a Mother, As a Woman," "Hakone Fuunroku," "Yamabiko School," and "Children of the Atomic Bomb" based on the demands of the masses and with the money of the masses. We received assistance from many cultural groups.
    In May of this year, when our "Zenshinza" theater troupe went to perform in the coal mines of Hokkaido, at the Akabira coal mine in Toyosato, we agreed to borrow the elementary school for the performance. However, the company, the town mayor, the head of the education department, the union cadres, and the police discussed during the banquet and decided not to let us perform; they suddenly said that the elementary school could not be borrowed. The workers who had already bought tickets flocked to the school. More than 2,000 people crowded in front of the lecture hall, shouting, "Perform! Perform!" Thanks to the strength of the masses, we finally performed. The police who were dispatched had no choice but to ambush us on the way back and arrest eleven students and members of our troupe who watched the show. There was no arrest warrant at all; it was just a brutal exercise of violence.
    Gentlemen! This elementary school can allow elementary school students to watch nude plays but will not let us perform Moliere's "The Miser" and the Japanese classical masterpiece national dance Kinmatsu's "Shunkan." This is what a government that once banned the performance of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" did. The crazy Yoshida government, which suppressed these valuable heritages of world culture, completely exposed its fascist true colors, and there is no more certain evidence than this. Hitler burned all the famous works and persecuted writers; there is no difference between them.
    The Yoshida government finally issued an arrest warrant for me. I know that they did this because they were afraid that I had given spiritual encouragement to the coal miners' struggle for peace, they wanted to use nude plays to paralyze the workers, they wanted to destroy national culture, and they wanted to strangle the "Zenshinza" theater troupe. In order to resist this oppression, I resolutely went to the stage to perform. I announced that my struggle against violence is to serve the people; this is the path of true art. I said to the masses: "If you tell me to go, I will go to the police station immediately. My body is yours. I will act according to your instructions. I am waiting for you to tell me what to do." Thousands of spectators shouted with tears in their eyes, applauding like thunder, saying: "We protect you, there is no crime, there is no need to go." I, as an actor, was moved to tears by this happiness.
    Since then, under the protection of the masses, I detoured to many places such as Sapporo, Muroran, Hakodate, Otaru, and Sunakawa to perform. The government authorities dispatched armed police, plainclothes detectives, and even police reserves, chasing me on trains, streets, and theaters with tear gas, pistols, and batons. Under the protection of the masses, I still openly played "Shunkan" on the stage.
    The audience shouted at the police who broke into the theater: "You are not allowed to move around during the performance." Some people who were hit on the head with batons were even unconscious for twelve hours. Because the police used violence, thousands of people were injured. The masses cursed angrily: "Our taxes support you guys. You have all turned into dogs." Who exactly used violence? The masses personally realized where the violence really came from. I really can't express the anger in my heart about these scenes I experienced personally. In Otaru, an old woman was finally beaten to death by a baton, and she was a respectable martyr for peace. I think her death was not in vain.
    Gentlemen! Everywhere, workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, and people from all walks of life, risked their lives, united like one person, to protect culture, to protect the "Zenshinza" theater troupe, and to protect me; what does this mean? This is the expression of true love for peace, freedom, and democracy! This is the national anger erupted from the resistance to militarist oppression.
    Throughout Japan, the Japanese people are fighting for peace in all aspects; and this is the struggle for peace that has emerged on the theater front. Amidst the encirclement and violence of thousands of policemen, performing grandly on the stage, I have personally experienced this united strength of the Japanese people and this great potential of the nation. This united strength is precisely the strength of peace. This force shows that it can defeat war.
    The Japanese people have been mobilized to fight for peace. The Japanese people are willing to risk their lives to defend peace, and I have personally realized in every day's meeting that you are also willing to risk your lives to fight together for peace. I would like to express the greatest respect and trust to you on behalf of the Japanese people. In Japan, even an actor like me has to stand up and fight for peace, and the people's peace movement is moving forward. The power of this Japanese peace movement is now sending me here in order to realize the desire to unite with the Asian people.
    For the sake of peace, we must discuss the cause of peace with all the workers, peasants, intellectuals, entrepreneurs, and everyone else in Asia, and carry out a common struggle. And, I want to repeatedly ask you to give the Japanese people assistance; that is, to ask you to fight together for the overall reconciliation that the Japanese people demand! (Xinhua News Agency)

    日本代表团代理团长、著名演员
    中村翫右卫门的发言（摘要）
    我是一个演员，父亲和哥哥也都是演员。我从五岁时起开始登上舞台，到现在已继续了四十七年的演员生活。我和我的朋友河原崎长十郎一起在一九三○年就组织了“前进座”剧团。为什么一个演员会成为和平战士呢？
    大家都知道，在日本的东条时代，日本人民陷于无知的与不幸的深渊，演剧、电影、一切的文化，在军国主义高压之下，被剥夺了自由。我们被强迫上演宣传战争的戏剧。战争结束后，我反省到：自己虽然在内心里始终反对战争，但是在舞台上曾经演过宣传战争的戏剧的事实，使世界的人民和日本的人民都受到损害；我深深地感到日本必须向世界的人民谢罪！而我的谢罪，就在于为了今后不再发生战争，要坚决地贡献全部身心于争取和平的事业。诸位先生，这也决不仅我一个人是如此；日本人民都是认真地表示要为和平事业尽他们的心力的。
    但是，战后的日本作为民主国家，能够尽力于世界和平的喜悦，已成为一瞬间的美梦了。美国战争贩子把日本当作比东条时代更为凶恶的侵略亚洲战争的据点，当作发动第三次世界侵略战争的基地的阴谋，已经在实行起来了。正因为这样，日本国民现在又在遭受着生活的灾难了。人们在内心里要求着健康的和有气魄的电影和演剧，他们因为生活困苦想得到片刻的安慰。但是战争贩子们就巧妙地利用这个机会推行殖民地化的文化，把广播、报纸、杂志、电影、演剧、美术、教育、科学等一切的文化，都涂上了亲美的和军国主义化的色彩。
    我们前进座剧团，从前年、去年到今年摄制了两部电影。去年度日本全部上演的电影，输入的电影共有二百一十五部，其中一百五十部都是美国片；十五部是英国、法国、意大利的片子，苏联片却只有两部。这就是现在日本亲美倾向的例子。而且，电影公司又由被解除整肃的战犯来担任经理了；东宝公司表示了反对中国和苏联的态度，禁止摄制民主化的电影。对此，我们以导向和平的民族的民主电影的发展为目的，和进步的电影工作者合作，在全国举行戏剧公演的时候，说明情况，向群众募集资金，开始了世界上前所未有的以零碎积聚得来的资金、依靠以工人、农民为首的各阶层广泛的人民群众的力量，自主地摄制了“不，我们要活下去！”这部片子。我们能够用群众的力量摄制民主的电影，这对于殖民地化的电影是一个巨大的反抗；因此，立刻就遭受到暴力的压迫。开始拍片的同时，有四个摄影师失踪了，延迟了摄影的进行。因为他们以莫须有的理由被美军当局逮捕并扣留了一个星期。我们还受到电影院方面及其他各种的破坏。最后终于又莫名其妙地有一千名以上的警察，在拂晓时分冲进我们的住宅，捣毁了所有的道具。打开了没有感光的胶片的盒子，使摄影陷于不能进行的地步。
    我们虽然遭受了这些说不完的压迫，但是人民所给予我们的支持，始终是占压倒优势的。我们不止一次地被这种热情感动得哭了。工厂里的群众，在困苦的生活中，为了筹集资金，有的从事副业，有的卖血，把这样得到的钱送给我们。在农村里，老大娘从她的围裙里拿出了小纸包，又从小纸包里拿出钱来给我们，说：“拿去吧，好好干。”前桥中学一个三年级的女学生，走到我的房内来，拿出一千圆来作为电影的资金，说：“我从小的时候起就开始积蓄，预备长大了到外国去留学，钱是这样地攒起来的。听说‘前进座’剧团要拍一部日本最好的电影，现在把全部存款都拿来了。”这样的例子，在我国不计其数。还有中国人民和在中国的日本人，以友好的真心从辽远的中国把募集起来的三十万元的资金寄给我们。我实在忍不住我的眼泪。我们受到这些鼓励，把“不，我们要活下去！”这部片子摄制成功。并且继续产生了根据群众的要求和用群众的金钱摄制的“作为母亲，作为女人”、“箱根风云录”、“山彦学校”、“原子弹下的孩子们”这些民主的影片。我们得到了许许多多文化小组的援助。
    今年五月，我们“前进座”剧团到北海道的煤矿去公演的时候，在丰里的赤平煤矿，说好借小学校举行公演。但是公司方面、镇长、教务主任、工会干部和警察们，在宴会中商量好不让我们演出；突然说小学校不能借用了。已经买了票的工人都涌到学校里来。两千多人拥挤在讲堂的前面，叫嚷着：“演吧！演吧！”由于群众的力量，我们终于上演了。出动来的警察们无可奈何，只好在我们回去的路上打伏击，把看戏的学生和我们的团员逮捕了十一人。这根本是没有逮捕命令的；只是蛮横地行使暴力。
    各位先生！这个小学校可以给小学生们看裸体剧而不让我们上演莫里哀的“守财奴”和日本古典杰作民族舞踊近松的“俊宽”。这就是曾经禁止上演英国剧圣莎士比亚的“仲夏夜之梦”的政府所干的勾当。压制这些世界文化宝贵遗产的疯狂的吉田政府，完全暴露了它的法西斯的本来面目，再没有比这更确实的证据了。希特勒曾经焚毁所有著名的作品，迫害作家；他们之间没有任何不同之处。
    吉田政府终于对我发出了逮捕命令。我知道：他们这样作，是害怕我对煤矿工人为和平的斗争作了精神的鼓励，他们要用裸体剧来麻痹工人们，他们要破坏民族文化，他们要扼杀“前进座”剧团。我为了反抗这个压迫断然地到舞台上去出演。我宣布我对暴力进行斗争，就是为人民服务；这也就是真正的艺术的道路。我向群众说：“如果你们叫我去，我就立刻到警察署去。我的身体是你们的。我听从你们的指示而行动。我等待你们叫我怎样干。”数千个观众流着眼泪，鼓掌如雷地叫喊着说：“我们保护你，没有犯罪，没有去的必要。”我，作为一个演员，为这种幸福感动得泣不成声。
    自此以后，我在群众的保卫之下，绕道到扎幌、室兰、函馆、小樽、砂川等许多地方出演。政府当局出动了武装警察、便衣侦探甚至警察后备队，在火车上、街上和戏园里，拿着催泪弹、手枪、棍棒追赶着我。我在群众的保护之中仍然公开地在舞台上扮演“俊宽”。
    观众对于闯进戏院里来的警察，叫着说：“在上演的时间里不许你们乱动。”头上被棍棒打了的人，有的甚至人事不知达十二小时。因为警察行使暴力，有数千人负伤。群众怒骂着说：“我们的税款养活着你们这些家伙。你们都变成了狗了。”到底是谁行使了暴力呢？群众亲身认识到了暴力真正是从那里来的。我亲身经历到的这些情景，实在说不出满腔的愤怒。在小樽，终于有一位老婆婆遭受棍棒的殴打而死了，这就是一个可尊敬的保卫和平的牺牲者。我认为她的死不是白死了的。
    诸位先生！到处的工人、农民、学生、知识分子、中小工商业者、所有各阶层的人们，冒着生命的危险，团结得像一个人一样，保卫文化，保卫“前进座”剧团，保卫着我；这是意味着什么呢？这是对于和平、自由、民主的真正的爱情的表现！这是对于军国主义压迫的反抗所迸发的民族的愤怒。
    在日本全国，日本人民在所有的方面为和平而进行斗争；而这是在演剧战线上所出现的为和平的斗争。在数千名警察的包围和行使暴力之中，堂堂皇皇地在舞台上出演，这种日本人民的团结力量，这种国民的伟大的潜力，我已经亲身地体验到了。这种团结的力量，正是和平的力量。这个力量，显示着是可以战胜战争的。
    日本人民为了争取和平已在动员起来了。日本人民为了保卫和平不惜生命，诸位先生也能不惜生命地共同为争取和平而斗争，我在每天的会议上也已经亲身地认识到了。我愿意代表日本国民对诸位先生表示最大的敬意和信任。在日本，像我这样一个演员，也不得不起来为和平而斗争，人民的和平运动，正在向前发展着。这个日本和平运动的力量，现在把我派遣到这里来，就是为了要实现和亚洲人民团结起来的愿望。
    为了和平，我们要和全亚洲的工人、农民、知识分子、企业家和所有一切的人们商量和平的事业，进行共同的斗争。并且，我要一再地要求诸位先生给日本人民以援助；那就是要求你们为日本人民所要求的全面媾和而共同斗争！    　（新华社）
