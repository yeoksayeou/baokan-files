Xinhua News Agency, October 24th dispatch: According to TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held its first meeting on October 22nd. The meeting was characterized by a sharp struggle over the order of discussion of various items on the committee's agenda.

The US-British group of representatives attempted to force the committee to postpone discussion of the most important international issues, such as the Korean question, the Polish delegation's proposal on "Eliminating the Threat of Another World War and Strengthening International Peace and Friendly Cooperation," and the issues of Tunisia and Morocco.

Polish Foreign Minister Skrzeszewski demanded that the committee first discuss the Polish proposal, as it concerned fundamental issues such as ending the Korean War, reducing armaments, banning atomic, bacteriological, and other weapons of mass destruction, and concluding a Great Power Peace Pact.

Soviet Representative Gromyko supported the Polish representative's request. He said: The Soviet delegation believes that the Political Committee should first discuss the Polish proposal because it concerns the most important and urgent issues, namely international peace and security. Gromyko emphasized that the people of the world are demanding an early end to the Korean War, a ban on atomic and bacteriological weapons, and the conclusion of a Great Power Peace Pact. If the committee does not do so, it is following the intentions of those governments that do not want to resolve any of these issues.

After the representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, and Belarus emphasized the extreme importance of the issues raised in the Polish representative's proposal, the US-British group representatives were forced to change their tactics. Although they continued to oppose placing the Polish proposal as the first item on the committee's agenda, they did not dare to oppose the proposal by some delegations to first discuss the Korean question, because the vast majority of representatives from Asian, Latin American, and Western European countries emphasized at the committee meeting that ending the Korean War was the General Assembly's primary task. The Political Committee passed the motion to place the Korean question as the first item on the committee's agenda.

The US-British group mustered enough votes to reject the Polish delegation's proposal to place the elimination of the threat of another world war and the strengthening of international peace and friendly cooperation as the first item on the committee's agenda. The representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, and Ukraine voted in favor of this proposal. Representatives from eight countries, including Yemen, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan, abstained. Subsequently, the US-British majority group again rejected the Polish proposal to place the issues raised by Poland as the second item on the agenda.

Despite the opposition of the representatives of the colonial powers, the Political Committee decided to place the issues of Tunisia and Morocco as the second and third items on the committee's agenda. Thirty-four delegations voted in favor of this proposal, including the Soviet Union, Poland, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, thirteen Arab and Asian countries, and some Latin American countries such as Chile, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Uruguay, and El Salvador. Twenty delegations voted against this proposal, including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch, New York, October 23rd: The United Nations General Assembly Special Political Committee elected Simpson, the representative of Liberia, as Vice-Chairman and Salazar, the representative of the Dominican Republic, as Rapporteur at the morning meeting on October 22nd. After a brief discussion following the election, the committee adopted the agenda. During the discussion of the agenda, Australian Representative Shaw suggested placing the following two issues—the treatment of people of Indian origin in the Union of South Africa and the racial conflict caused by the South African government's apartheid policy (racial discrimination policy) in the Union of South Africa—at the end of the agenda, but his attempt failed.

Indian Representative Pandit urged an early discussion of these issues because they involve threats to world peace. The United States and Britain supported Australia, while the Soviet Union, Pakistan, Iraq, and Mexico supported India's proposal.

Finally, the committee adopted Pakistan's proposal to place these two issues as the second and third items on the agenda with thirty votes in favor, twelve votes against, and fourteen abstentions. The committee unanimously adopted the issue of Palestinian refugees as the first item on the agenda without objection. The meeting was adjourned until October 23rd.

    联大政治委员会对议程次序展开尖锐斗争
    苏波等国代表坚主首先讨论波兰和平建议
    美英集团竟横加阻挠证明其不愿和平解决任何问题
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会十月二十二日举行第一次会议，会议的特点是关于委员会议程上各个项目讨论次序的尖锐斗争。
    美英集团代表企图强使委员会把朝鲜问题、波兰代表团提出的“关于消除另一次世界大战威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作”的建议、突尼斯与摩洛哥问题等最重要的国际问题放在后面讨论。
    波兰外交部长斯克列杰夫斯基要求委员会首先讨论波兰建议，因为这个建议涉及像结束朝鲜战争，裁减军备，禁止原子武器、细菌武器与其他大规模毁灭性武器以及缔结大国和平公约这样根本性的问题。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯支持波兰代表的要求。他说：苏联代表团认为政治委员会应该首先讨论波兰的建议，因为这个建议涉及最重要、最迫切的问题，即国际和平与安全的问题。葛罗米柯强调说：世界各国人民都要求尽早结束朝鲜战争，禁止原子武器与细菌武器，缔结大国和平公约。如果委员会不这样做，它就追随了那些对这些问题一个也不想解决的政府的意图。
    在苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰和白俄罗斯的代表强调指出波兰代表的建议所提出的问题是极其重要的以后，美英集团代表被迫改变了他们的策略。虽然他们继续反对把波兰建议列为委员会议程第一项，但是没有敢反对一些代表团所提出的首先讨论朝鲜问题的建议，因为绝大多数亚洲、拉丁美洲和西欧国家的代表都在委员会会议上强调指出：结束朝鲜战争是大会首要的任务。政治委员会通过把朝鲜问题列为委员会议程第一项。
    美英集团凑够票数，否决了波兰代表团所提把消除另一次世界大战威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作的问题列为委员会议程第一项的建议。苏联、波兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克和乌克兰代表在表决中投票赞成这个建议。也门、伊朗、伊拉克和阿富汗等八个国家代表弃权。接着，美英多数集团又否决了波兰所提把波兰提出的问题列为议程第二项的建议。
    尽管殖民国家代表的反对，政治委员会仍然决定把突尼斯和摩洛哥问题列为委员会议程的第二、第三项。三十四个代表团投票赞成这个建议，其中包括苏联、波兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰、十三个阿拉伯和亚洲国家，一些拉丁美洲国家如智利、巴西、古巴、墨西哥、乌拉圭和萨尔瓦多等。二十个代表团投票反对这个建议，其中包括英国、法国、比利时、荷兰和新西兰。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日电：联合国大会特别政治委员会在十月二十二日上午会议上选举利比里亚代表辛普森为副主席，多米尼加代表萨拉沙尔为报告员。在选举之后经过简单讨论就通过了委员会的议程。在讨论议程的时候，澳大利亚代表萧氏曾建议把下列两个问题——南非联邦印度籍人民所受到的待遇问题以及南非政府的种族隔离政策
    （种族歧视政策）在南非联邦引起的种族冲突问题——摆在议程的最后，但是他的企图失败了。
    印度代表潘迪特夫人敦促早日讨论这些问题，因为这种问题涉及对于世界和平的威胁问题。美、英两国支持澳大利亚，苏联、巴基斯坦、伊拉克和墨西哥则支持印度的主张。
    最后，委员会以三十票赞成，十二票反对，十四票弃权通过了巴基斯坦提出的把这两个问题列为议程的第二、三项的建议。委员会无异议地一致通过把巴勒斯坦难民问题列为议程的第一项。会议至此休会到十月二十三日再行复会。
