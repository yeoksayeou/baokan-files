    Resolutely Defend Peace and Fight to the End for the Victory of Resisting America and Aiding Korea!
    --Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' Participation in the War
    The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers have been fighting abroad for two years to resist America and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, and defend peace in the Far East and the world.
    For two years, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have jointly resisted the American imperialist aggressor army and the accomplice armies of its sixteen vassal states, defeated the elite main forces of the American army, navy, and air force; defeated the attacks of the American imperialists' inhumane bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and napalm bombs; overcome countless difficulties, and achieved a great victory in the Korean anti-aggression war.
    Over the past two years, the development of the Korean War situation has become more favorable to the Chinese and Korean people and more unfavorable to the enemy.
    From October 25, 1950, to October 15 of this year, the Chinese and Korean People's armies annihilated a total of more than 660,000 enemy troops, of which more than 290,000 were American troops. They shot down and damaged more than 7,300 enemy aircraft and destroyed and damaged more than 2,000 enemy tanks. The war strength of the American invading army has been greatly weakened, while the Chinese and Korean People's armies have become stronger and stronger in battle. The Chinese People's Volunteers have not only strengthened their modern technical equipment in the war, but also become familiar with and mastered this technical equipment and enriched their modern combat experience. American generals have already cried out that their air superiority is gradually disappearing, and our army's artillery fire is "fierce" and "accurate." At present, the Chinese and Korean People's armies have a consolidated defense line, so they can not only smash every enemy attack but also take the complete initiative to strike the enemy. Our transportation and supply work has also been improved unprecedentedly. The enemy's attempt to cut off our front-line material supply with frantic bombing has obviously become a fantasy. Even the American aggressors' inhumane germ warfare has failed in the struggle against bacteriological warfare by the Chinese and Korean People's armies and the broad masses of the people.
    The victory of the Korean anti-aggression war has further encouraged the confidence and determination of our people and the Korean people to jointly oppose the American aggressors. Our people have simultaneously promoted various reforms and construction work in the great movement to resist America and aid Korea. We have already managed to support the war, stabilize prices, and carry out construction at the same time. In 1952, industrial and agricultural production reached and exceeded the highest annual output before the war. Railways, transportation, forestry, water conservancy, and other construction have also made great progress. With the development of economic construction, cultural construction has also made significant achievements. The fighting unity of the Chinese and Korean people has become more consolidated. The strength of this unity cannot be destroyed by the American aggressors.
    The anti-aggression struggle of the Chinese and Korean people is closely related to the struggle of people all over the world to defend peace. The victory in the Korean War not only defended the independence and freedom of Korea but also struck a blow to the American imperialists' ambition to dominate the world, and encouraged the confidence and courage of the peace-loving people of Asia and the world to oppose American aggression and defend world peace. This is a huge contribution to the cause of world peace.
    The difficulties of the American aggressors are increasing. The war of aggression against Korea has caused the American armed forces to suffer an average of more than 10,000 casualties per month and consume about 800,000 tons of materials per month. The United States has spent $20 billion on the Korean War in the past two years. The prolongation of the war can only deepen the economic crisis in the United States, further demoralize the invading army, and deepen the contradictions between imperialists. The American aggressor army's atrocities of rape, murder, arson, and indiscriminate bombing in Korea have long aroused the opposition of the people of the world. The crime of the United States in carrying out germ warfare in Korea has aroused even more anger and opposition from the people of the world. The aggressors who launched the war are reaping the bitter fruits of their own actions, and they will not be able to escape their final defeat.
    The righteous receive much support, while the unjust receive little support. This is the fundamental reason why the Chinese and Korean people are bound to win and the American aggressors are bound to fail. The facts on the Korean battlefield over the past two years have proved this, and the facts at the Korean negotiating table have also proved this.
    In the year and three months of the armistice negotiations, the American representatives put forward many extremely absurd conditions at the negotiating table. For example, in the discussion of determining the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, the American representatives stubbornly insisted on seizing 12,000 square kilometers of land in northern Korea. In the discussion of the issue of armistice supervision, the U.S. side attempted to interfere in the internal affairs of Korea and demanded restrictions on the restoration and construction of airports in northern Korea. Especially regarding the discussion of the prisoner-of-war issue, since December of last year, for ten months, the U.S. side has violated the Geneva Convention and insisted on the absurd proposition of so-called "voluntary repatriation," attempting to detain 68% of our volunteers and 20% of the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, and forcibly hand them over to the Lee Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to serve as cannon fodder. When these unreasonable demands of the U.S. side were solemnly rejected by the Chinese and Korean sides, they were unreasonable, refused to negotiate, absconded from the meeting, adjourned the meeting regularly, and until recently unilaterally announced an indefinite adjournment, bringing the negotiations to a standstill and on the verge of rupture. At the same time, the U.S. side also adopted various extremely despicable and shameless hooligan tactics outside the meeting, such as using so-called "military pressure," infringing upon and bombing neutral zones, killing staff members of the Chinese and Korean sides, carrying out germ warfare, using chemical weapons, torturing and killing captured personnel of the Chinese and Korean sides, and indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities and peaceful residents in the rear of Korea, in an attempt to force the Chinese and Korean sides to submit and accept their unreasonable conditions. However, the Chinese and Korean sides are justified, strong, steadfast, and unyielding. The Chinese and Korean sides have promptly and solemnly exposed the various absurd propositions of the U.S. side and responded to all provocations of the U.S. side to sabotage the negotiations with resolute and powerful actions.
    The Chinese and Korean sides have clearly told the American imperialists that it is absolutely impossible to get at the negotiating table what it cannot get on the battlefield; similarly, it is also in vain to try to get on the battlefield what it cannot get at the negotiating table. Now, the Korean armistice negotiations only have the issue of repatriating prisoners of war left. As long as the American imperialists abide by the already agreed-upon draft armistice agreement, abide by the Geneva Convention, and repatriate all prisoners of war on both sides, the negotiating stalemate can be quickly broken, and the Korean armistice can be realized at an early date. However, we also see more clearly that the ruling group in the United States, for the high profits of a few monopoly capitalists, is continuing to create a tense international situation. They are attempting to realize their conspiracy to expand the war by sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations. Therefore, after a year and three months of armistice negotiations, due to the deliberate sabotage of the U.S. side, there is still the possibility of a rupture. This is what we and all peace-loving people in the world should be vigilant about.
    We, the Chinese people, will continue to adhere to our consistent position of peacefully resolving the Korean issue and strive to achieve a Korean armistice on a fair and reasonable basis. As long as there is still a possibility of continuing the armistice negotiations, we will continue to persist in the Korean armistice negotiations. But since the American aggressors are still continuing their aggression and sabotaging the negotiations, we must continue to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and fight heroically to smash the American imperialists' conspiracy to sabotage the negotiations and expand the war, and fight until the Korean armistice is realized on a fair and reasonable basis. No matter what threats or tricks the American imperialists come up with that have existed or never existed in the world, they will never be able to stop the Chinese and Korean people from achieving the final victory in this heroic and sacred struggle. In our country, we must continue to consolidate national defense, strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and defend the peaceful construction of the motherland.
    In the two years of the sacred war to resist America and aid Korea, the Chinese people have forged an unbreakable brotherly fighting friendship with the Korean people. The common struggle of our two peoples has received warm support from the progressive people of the world. At the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference that just concluded in Beijing, the resolution on the Korean issue pointed out: "The armistice negotiations, which the people of Asia and the world have longed to reach an agreement on at an early date, have been greatly obstructed because the American representatives have refused to repatriate all prisoners of war and unilaterally decided to adjourn the meeting indefinitely." "The Korean War is in danger of prolongation and expansion, and the situation in the Far East is becoming more serious." Therefore, the conference put forward four proposals on the Korean issue, calling on the people of the world to make every effort to resolve the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis. We fully support this just proposal and support the demand put forward in the letter from the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to the United Nations that "the United Nations should immediately promote the realization of a Korean armistice agreement on a fair and reasonable basis." Although American imperialism is still oppressing its vassal states, forcing many member states of the United Nations to dare not express their desire for an immediate end to the Korean War, we believe that as long as the Chinese and Korean People's armies, the Chinese and Korean people, and the people of the world continue to work hard, the Korean War can certainly be victoriously ended, and American imperialism's declining aggressive policy will inevitably be completely defeated.

### 坚决保卫和平，为抗美援朝的胜利奋斗到底！——纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战两周年

    坚决保卫和平，为抗美援朝的胜利奋斗到底！
    ——纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战两周年
    英勇的中国人民志愿军，为了抗美援朝、保家卫国，为了保卫远东和世界的和平，出国作战已经两周年了。
    两年以来，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，共同抵抗着美帝国主义侵略军及其十六个仆从国家的帮凶军，击败了美国陆、海、空军的精锐主力；击败了美帝国主义所使用的灭绝人性的细菌武器、化学武器和凝固汽油弹等的进攻；战胜了无数的困难，取得了朝鲜反侵略战争的伟大胜利。
    两年来朝鲜战争形势的发展，对于朝中人民更加有利，对于敌人更加不利了。
    朝中人民军队自一九五○年十月二十五日至今年十月十五日，共歼灭敌军六十六万余人，其中美军占二十九万余人。击落击伤敌机七千三百余架，击毁击伤敌坦克二千余辆。美国侵略军的战争实力大大削弱了，朝中人民军队却愈战愈强了。中国人民志愿军不仅在战争中加强了现代化的技术装备，而且在战争中熟习与掌握了这些技术装备，丰富了现代化的作战经验。美国的将军们，已经叫喊他们的空中优势正逐渐消失，而我军的炮火，是“猛烈”而且“准确”的。目前，朝中人民军队已经有了巩固的防线，因而不仅能够粉碎了敌人的每一次进攻，而且可以完全主动地打击敌人。我方的运输供应工作也已空前地改善了。敌人以疯狂轰炸来断绝我前线物资供给的企图，显然成了幻想。就连美国侵略者灭绝人性的细菌战，也在朝中人民军队和广大人民反细菌战斗争中失败下去了。
    朝鲜反侵略战争的胜利，更加鼓舞了我国人民与朝鲜人民共同反对美国侵略者的信心和决心。我国人民在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，同时推进了各项改革和建设工作。我们已经做到了一面支援战争，一面稳定物价，一面进行建设。一九五二年的工农业生产已经达到并超过了战前最高的年产量。铁路、交通、林业、水利等各种建设，也有很大进步。随着经济建设的发展，文化建设也有显著成绩。朝中人民的战斗团结更加巩固了。这个团结的力量是美国侵略者所不能摧毁的。
    朝中人民反侵略斗争是和全世界人民所进行的保卫和平的斗争息息相关的。朝鲜战争的胜利，不仅保卫了朝鲜的独立自由，而且打击了美帝国主义称霸世界的侵略气焰，鼓舞了全亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民反对美国侵略、保卫世界和平的信心和勇气。这对于世界人民保卫和平的事业是一个巨大的贡献。
    美国侵略者的困难越来越多了。侵朝战争使美国武装部队每月平均死伤一万余人，消耗物资每月在八十万吨左右。美国用于朝鲜的战费两年来已达二百亿美元。战争的延长只能使美国国内的经济危机加深，侵略军士气更加不振，并使帝国主义之间的矛盾日益加深。美国侵略军在朝鲜奸淫烧杀狂轰滥炸的暴行，早已引起了全世界人民的反对。美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的罪行，更引起了全世界人民的愤怒和反对。发动战争的侵略者正在自食其恶果，它将不能逃避其最后的失败。
    正义者多助，反正义者寡助，这就是朝中人民所以必胜、美国侵略者所以必败的根本原因。两年来朝鲜战场上的事实已经这样地证明了，在朝鲜谈判桌子上的事实也这样地证明了。
    在一年零三个月的停战谈判中，美国代表在谈判桌上所提出的许多条件都是极端荒谬的。例如在确定军事分界线和非军事区问题的讨论中，美国代表曾经固执地要强占朝鲜北部一万二千平方公里的土地。在关于停战监督问题的讨论中，美方曾妄图干涉朝鲜内政，要求限制朝鲜北部修复和建筑机场。尤其关于俘虏问题的讨论，从去年十二月开始到现在十个月以来，美方一直违反日内瓦公约，坚持所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，企图扣留我方志愿军百分之六十八、朝鲜人民军被俘人员的百分之二十，要强迫把他们交给李承晚、蒋介石匪帮充当炮灰。而当美方的这些无理主张遭到朝中方面严正拒绝的时候，他们就蛮不讲理，拒绝协商，由逃会，定期休会，直到最近片面宣布无限期休会，使谈判陷于中断，濒于破裂。同时，美方还在会议外采取种种极端卑鄙无耻的流氓手段，如使用所谓“军事压力”，侵犯和轰炸中立区，杀害朝中方面工作人员，进行细菌战，使用化学武器，虐待与残杀朝中方面被俘人员，以及对朝鲜后方和平城市与和平居民的狂轰滥炸等等，企图来压迫朝中方面屈服，接受其无理条件。但是，朝中方面是理直气壮，坚定不屈的。朝中方面及时地严正地揭露了美方的各种荒谬主张，并以坚决有力的行动，回击了美方破坏谈判的一切挑衅。
    朝中方面明白地告诉了美帝国主义者：要想在谈判桌上得到它在战场上所得不到的东西，是绝对不可能的；同样，它要想在战场上得到它在谈判桌上得不到的东西，也是枉费心机的。现在朝鲜停战谈判，只剩下一个遣返战俘的问题了。只要美帝国主义按照已经达成协议的停战协定草案，遵守日内瓦公约，全部遣返双方战俘，谈判僵局是可以迅速打开，朝鲜停战是可以早日实现的。然而我们也更清楚地看到，美国的统治集团，为了少数垄断资本家的高额利润，正继续制造紧张的国际局势。他们正企图以破坏朝鲜停战谈判的方法来实现其扩大战争的阴谋，因此进行了一年零三个月的停战谈判，由于美方的蓄意破坏，仍有破裂的可能。这是我们和全世界一切爱好和平的人们所应共同警惕的。
    我们中国人民将继续坚守我们一贯遵循的和平解决朝鲜问题的立场，力谋在公平合理基础上实现朝鲜停战。只要继续停战谈判还有可能，我们就将继续坚持朝鲜停战谈判。但是既然美国侵略者还在继续进行侵略，破坏谈判，我们就必须继续支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，以英勇的战斗去粉碎美帝国主义破坏谈判、扩大战争的阴谋，一直战斗到在公平合理的基础上实现朝鲜停战为止。美帝国主义无论拿出世界上存在过的或没有存在过的什么威胁，什么诡计，也休想阻止朝中人民这种英勇的神圣的奋斗达到最后的胜利。在我国国内，我们必须继续巩固国防，加强抗美援朝工作，保卫祖国的和平建设。
    在两年来神圣的抗美援朝战争中，中国人民已经与朝鲜人民结成了牢不可破的兄弟般的战斗友谊。我们两国人民的共同斗争受到了全世界进步人类的热烈支援。在北京刚刚闭幕的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，在关于朝鲜问题的决议中指出：“亚洲及世界人民所渴望早日获得协议的停战谈判，已因美国代表拒绝遣返全部战俘并片面决定无限期休会而遭受重大阻挠。”“朝鲜战争有延长和扩大的危险，并使远东局势更加严重。”因而会议提出了关于朝鲜问题的四项主张，号召全世界人民，尽一切努力，使朝鲜问题在公平合理的基础上获得解决。我们完全拥护这个正义的主张，并拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议致联合国书上所提出的“联合国应在公平合理的基础上立即促使朝鲜停战协定实现”的要求。尽管美帝国主义还在压迫它的附庸国家，迫使联合国的许多会员国不敢表现出它们对于立即停止朝鲜战争的渴望，但是我们相信，只要朝中人民军队、朝中人民和全世界人民继续努力，朝鲜战争一定可以胜利结束，美帝国主义的日暮途穷的侵略政策一定要遭到彻底的失败。
