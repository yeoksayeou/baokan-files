    A Democratic and Happy Family
    ——Visiting the Family of Lü Pei, a Member of the Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Lin Zhong
    The day I visited the home of Lü Pei, a member of the Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ju County, Shandong, happened to be the day they were holding their regular family meeting. In front of a portrait of Chairman Mao, the whole family, adults and children, sat around a table, eating lunch and holding a meeting. Golden cornbread, pancakes, fragrant egg and vermicelli soup, steaming hot, everyone was eating so sweetly and heartily.
    First, Lü Pei spoke up: "Let's start the meeting. It's been over half a month, let's check each other's progress on our individual patriotic production increase plans...." After a short silence, the floodgates opened. Lü Chunxiang (Lü Pei's eldest daughter) gave Lü Chunshui (Lü Pei's second son) some criticism. She said to Chunshui: "You were good for the first few days after making the plan, but these last few days you haven't been as good as before. You say you have things to do at home when you're at the cooperative, and you say you have things to do at the cooperative when you're at home. You're just playing games on both sides." Then, Lü Chunchi (Lü Pei's eldest son), Lü Chunxiu (Lü Pei's second daughter), and others praised Lü Chunlan (Lü Pei's third daughter), saying that she was active in labor, and always got up early to take the lead in working; they also pointed out that her shortcoming was that she was still a bit short-tempered and needed to correct that. Aunt Zhang Wenxiu (Lü Pei's wife) also criticized Lü Pei, saying that he was very active in the cooperative's affairs, but didn't care about the family's affairs at all. Lü Chunlan then suggested to her mother: she has fulfilled her tasks of cooking and feeding the pigs, but she still doesn't pay much attention to hygiene. Finally, the discussion focused on two issues: one was Lü Chunxiang's opposing opinion to her mother's criticism of her father for being active in the cooperative's affairs but not active in the family's affairs. She said: "This can't be said to be a shortcoming. We should care about the cooperative's affairs. If we only care about the family and don't care about the cooperative, the cooperative won't be run well, and we can forget about having such a good life." The other was the issue of hygiene. The whole family felt that this was a major issue. If we don't pay attention to hygiene, we won't be healthy and won't be able to work and produce well.
    This family has a total of nine people. Lü Pei is the storekeeper of the agricultural production cooperative, and Lü Chunxiang is the vice-chairman of the cooperative. They work diligently in the cooperative every day. They said: "We must strive to be labor models and go to the province to attend the meeting after the autumn harvest!"
    "My mother has also become a progressive element," Lü Chunxiang said, laughing. Aunt Zhang Wenxiu took over and narrated a story that happened last year that the children use as a joke. Last year, when the new year was approaching, the whole family held a family meeting. At the meeting, Lü Pei made a suggestion that they should no longer build a "heaven and earth shrine" to worship the gods during the New Year. Lü Chunxiang was the first to agree with this suggestion. Everyone also felt that it was right to do so, but Zhang Wenxiu was still a bit hesitant, thinking that it was an old custom and that not building the shrine would cause bad things to happen. But this was just a thought in her mind, because she was afraid that everyone would oppose it, and she didn't have enough reasons to convince others, so she didn't dare to say it. On the afternoon of the thirtieth of the twelfth lunar month, she secretly built the "heaven and earth shrine". This caused a commotion. When Lü Pei came back and saw it, he scolded her for being "old-fashioned" and "superstitious". Zhang Wenxiu also argued with him, her face red and her neck thick. In the end, Lü Chunxiang persuaded her father, saying, "What's the use of just arguing? Let's hold a family meeting to resolve it." That night, Zhang Wenxiu couldn't sleep in bed, her mind churning with thoughts. The past difficult life, the struggle for liberation, organizing together... one scene after another appeared before her eyes, and she became more and more sad. She resented her own backward thinking and said in her heart, "I can't not change!" The next morning, she and Chunshui demolished the newly built shrine together. From that time on, after finishing her household chores every day, Zhang Wenxiu went to the fields to work. In the patriotic donation movement, she was the first to propose that they should learn from the labor model Lü Hongbin and donate two hundred and fifty catties of wheat. Chairman Mao called for it, and she would go wherever he called.
    The situation in Lü Pei's family is also gradually changing. Lü Pei himself said: "These few years of life have really been a great education for me!"
    Lü Pei used to be a hot-tempered person. The difficult days of the old society made his temper flare up frequently. At that time, the whole family of six people made carpentry work day and night, and Zhang Wenxiu spun thread day and night, but they still lacked food and clothing. The children cried from hunger, Zhang Wenxiu complained that Lü Pei had no ability, and Lü Pei complained that the family was just a bunch of gluttons, so there was not a day without quarrels. When Lü Pei got angry, he would drink a lot of alcohol and go home to scold everyone to vent his anger. The adults and children didn't dare to face him. This dark life tormented Lü Pei's whole family, and Zhang Wenxiu often said bitterly: "I don't know what sins I committed in my past life."
    After liberation, Chairman Mao's brilliance illuminated his home. They were allocated nineteen mu of land in the land reform, and later implemented organization and development of production, built six new houses, and life became richer day by day. Lü Pei's rough temper also changed greatly; but he was still dictatorial on certain things in the family, and often quarreled with his family. However, people's awareness was increasing day by day. Every time at the family meeting, Lü Pei's undemocratic style was criticized. At a family meeting last year, even seven-year-old Chunrong criticized him for scolding people and drinking. This meeting was a powerful education for Lü Pei, and he began to consciously overcome his undemocratic style. After that, whenever there were important matters concerning the family, he would always discuss them with the whole family.
    After joining the agricultural production cooperative, their harmonious family life was filled with new working relationships, everyone was focused on one goal - building a happier life, so they became more united and active.
    The National Day is coming soon, and the whole family unanimously agreed to write a letter to Chairman Mao.
    Still during a gathering for lunch, a scribe was invited, and everyone sat around a small table, enthusiastically writing a letter to Chairman Mao. Zhang Wenxiu said: "Whenever I pick up a soft cornbread pancake or a white flour steamed bun, and see the newly made big floral calico quilt, I think of the past sorghum pancakes and the tattered patchwork quilt that the whole family of six shared, and I also think of Chairman Mao. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no family like ours! I wish him good health." Lü Chunxiang said: "I want to tell Chairman Mao that I, a poor girl who used to be looked down upon, have become the vice-chairman of the agricultural production cooperative under the education of the Party, and I have honorably joined the Communist Youth League. I used to be illiterate, but now I can read the Yishui Rural News. In the future, I will work even harder, study harder, and serve the people and the motherland." Finally, Lü Pei added: "Let's make a guarantee to Chairman Mao! Tell Chairman Mao that we have fully understood that without the country, there is no family, and without taking the road of organization, there will be no prosperous life. I guarantee to obey the call of the country in everything, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, resolutely run the agricultural production cooperative well, and learn from the Soviet elder brother, so as to move towards the happy collective farm road as soon as possible!"

    一个民主愉快的家庭
    ——访吕鸿宾农业生产合作社社员吕培的家庭
    林中
    我到山东莒县吕鸿宾农业生产合作社的社员吕培家的那天，正赶上他们开家庭例会。在毛主席像前，全家大人孩子团团地围了一桌子，一面吃午饭一面开会。焦黄的玉米，煎饼，香喷喷的鸡蛋熬粉皮，热气腾腾，个个都吃的那么香甜。
    首先是吕培开口了：“开会吧，半个多月了，咱们就互相检查检查个人的爱国增产计划的执行情况吧……。”稍微沉默了一会，话匣子便拉开了。吕春香（吕培长女）给吕春水（吕培次子）提意见，她对着春水说：“你订了计划的头几天还好，这几天就不如以前了，在社里说家里有事，在家里说社里有事，净两头捣鬼。”接着，吕春池（吕培长子）、吕春秀（吕培次女）等表扬了吕春兰（吕培三女），说她劳动积极，每天都是早起带头干活；也指出她的缺点是脾气还有些暴躁，要改正。张文秀大娘（吕培妻）也给吕培提了意见，说他对社里的事很积极，对家里的事一点也不管了。吕春兰则向母亲提出：她担负的做饭、喂猪等任务是做到了，就是还不大讲卫生。最后讨论集中在两个问题上：一个是吕春香对母亲给父亲提的对社里的事情积极、对家里的事情不积极的意见，提出相反的意见。她说：“这不能说是缺点。应当对社里的事情关心，要是光顾家里不管合作社，合作社办不好，也就别想有这样的好生活了。”一个是卫生问题，全家人都认为这是一个大问题，不好好讲卫生，就会使身体不健康，不能好好劳动生产。
    这个家庭共九口人，吕培是农业生产合作社的保管股股长，吕春香是合作社的副社长，每天都在合作社辛勤地工作着。他们说：“一定争取做劳动模范秋后到省里去开会！”
    “俺娘也成了进步分子了。”吕春香说着笑起来。张文秀大娘把话接过来，叙述了一个在去年发生的被孩子们作为笑谈的故事。去年快过年的时候，全家开了一个家庭会。会上，吕培提了一个意见，说过年不要再扎天地棚供神了。吕春香首先赞成了这个意见。大家也都觉着这样办很对，只有张文秀还有些犹豫，认为这是一个老风俗，怕不搭天地棚会惹出不好来。但这只是心里话，因为怕大家反对，又没有充分的理由说服别人，也就没敢说出来。到了腊月三十日的下午，她偷偷地把天地棚搭起来了。这一下可闹出事来了。吕培回来一看就“老封建”、“老迷信”地骂了起来。张文秀也脸红脖子粗地和他争吵。最后，还是吕春香劝着父亲，说：“光吵有什么用呀，还是开个家庭会解决解决吧。”晚上，张文秀躺在床上睡不着，脑子里七上八下地翻腾起来。过去的苦难生活，翻身斗争、组织起来……一出一出地呈现在眼前，她越想越难过。她怨恨自己的落后思想，心里说：“不改正可不行啊！”第二天一清早，她就和春水两个人把才搭好的天地棚拆掉了。从那时起，张文秀每天干完了家里的活，就到地里去劳动。在爱国捐献运动中，她首先提出要向劳动模范吕鸿宾看齐，捐献了二百五十斤小麦。毛主席号召到那里，她就要走到那里。
    吕培家里的这种情况，也是逐渐转变的。吕培自己说：“这几年的生活真是对我的一大教育啊！”
    吕培过去是一个火性人。旧社会里的苦难日子使他这种脾气经常发作。那时，全家六口人，白天黑夜做木匠活，张文秀白天黑夜纺线，可是还是缺吃少穿。孩子饿的直哭，张文秀埋怨吕培没本事，吕培埋怨家里人净是吃货，因而没有一天不吵架。吕培生起气来，就喝上一气酒，回家大骂一场消气。大人孩子都不敢见他的面。这种不见天日的生活折磨着吕培的全家，张文秀常狠狠地说：“不知那辈子作了孽。”
    解放了，毛主席的光辉照亮了他的家。他们在土地改革中分得了十九亩土地，以后实行组织起来，发展生产，盖了六间新房子，生活一天比一天富裕起来了。吕培的粗暴脾气也有了很大转变；但对家庭里的某些事情仍是独断专行，常常还和家里的人争吵，可是，人们的觉悟一天天地提高，每次家庭会上，吕培的不民主作风都受到批评，在去年的一次家庭会上，连七岁的春荣也对他骂人、喝酒提出意见。这次会议对吕培是个有力的教育，他开始自觉地克服那不民主的作风。以后，凡是关于家庭的一些重要事情，总是要多和全家商量。
    参加了农业生产合作社以后，他们这种和谐的家庭生活，又为新的工作关系充实起来，大家都集中到一个目标—建设更幸福的生活，因此就愈变得团结、活跃了。
    国庆节快来了，全家一致意见要给毛主席写一封信。
    仍是在一个团聚的午餐中，请了一个代笔人，大家围坐在一张小桌子旁边，热烈地给毛主席写起信来。张文秀说：“我一拿起软活活的玉米煎饼、白面馍馍，看见新做的大花洋布被，就想起过去的穇子煎饼和全家六口人盖的一床破补钉被，也就想起了毛主席，没有毛主席就没有俺这一家人啊！我祝福他老人家身体健康。”吕春香说：“我要告诉毛主席，我这个过去被人瞧不起的穷女孩子，在党的教育下，已成了农业生产合作社的副社长了，并且光荣地参加了青年团。过去瞎字不识，现在已能看沂水农村报了。今后我更要加倍地努力工作，努力学习，为人民服务，为祖国服务。”最后，吕培又作了补充说：“咱再向毛主席来个保证吧！说给毛主席，俺们已完全明白了没有国就没有家，不走组织起来的道路，就不会有富裕的生活。我保证处处服从国家的号召，巩固工农联盟，坚决办好农业生产合作社，向苏联老大哥学习，好尽快地走向幸福的集体农庄的道路！”
