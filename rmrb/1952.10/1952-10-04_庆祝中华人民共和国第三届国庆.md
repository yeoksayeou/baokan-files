The heroic Chinese people are a shining example for all peoples who are still subjected to imperialist plunder and oppression in their struggle for national freedom and independence. The deep and close friendship between the German people and the Chinese people has strengthened the great world peace camp, which, under the leadership of the powerful Soviet Union, will shatter the conspiracy of the American warmongers to launch a third world war; the friendship between the German people and the Chinese people has encouraged the German people to strengthen their struggle for national unification, the conclusion of a just peace treaty, and the defense of peace.
