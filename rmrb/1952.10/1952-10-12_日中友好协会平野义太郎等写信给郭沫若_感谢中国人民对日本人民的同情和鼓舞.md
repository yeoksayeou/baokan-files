Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: The presidium of the Japan-China Friendship Association's Cultural Conference, Yositaro Hirano, Kan Bunpo, Kenzo Nakajima, Daihokushi Murakumo and others wrote to Guo Moruo on September 13th, expressing their gratitude for the sympathy and encouragement given to the Japanese people in his open letter to the Japanese people on September 5th, "A Second Open Letter to the Japanese People on the Occasion of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference", and determined to strive to promote cultural exchanges between China and Japan and save peace. The letter is summarized as follows:

    We were very pleased to read your "Second Open Letter to the Japanese People on the Occasion of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference" written on September 5th.

    We feel that today's cultural exchange between Japan and China is particularly urgently needed by the Japanese people, so we convened the Japan-China Friendship Cultural Conference. At the meeting, we examined the achievements of past cultural exchanges between Japan and China by category, and discussed various conditions for future development and methods to promote development.

    The Japanese cultural circles are now facing a serious crisis. The Yoshida government has become a servant of imperialism hostile to Asia, attempting to rebuild the system of aggression against Asia, adapting Japanese culture to this system, and creating a so-called war culture full of decay and hypocrisy.

    We have personally experienced that the things that destroy Japanese life and culture are primarily wars of aggression. Today, everyone knows that Japan's prosperity depends on economic exchanges with China, that is, to restore and develop Japan-China trade. With the exception of military industries, everyone engaged in all peaceful industries in Japan, whether workers or entrepreneurs, sincerely hope that the "China-Japan Trade Agreement" can be realized, and a trade promotion movement has been launched throughout the country.

    Japanese culture is now being devastated by the corrupt and decadent culture of international imperialism. Japan, which is covered with more than 600 military bases, is full of gambling machines and "Bangbang" girls selling smiles to American and British soldiers.

    American films full of murder, lewdness, and speculation have dominated the nation's cinemas.

    However, we know that the essence of this culture is a means of driving Japan towards the destruction of war.

    The Japanese people, who are used as "human gophers" for atomic bomb experiments, hate the resurgence of militarism, and the movement to defend peace is growing stronger every day. The Japanese people also know that without peace, the Japanese people cannot achieve happiness and prosperity.

    The most touching part of the talks given by Ko Ra, Miyakoshi, and Hoashi after returning from China was about how sincerely the Chinese people love peace, how they do not bear old grudges, and how they extend friendly hands to the peace-loving Japanese people.

    Japanese cultural circles are deeply concerned about China's new culture and eager for cultural exchanges between the two countries. Today, the purpose of this conference is to entrust the representatives attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held soon in Beijing to hand over the various reports and resolutions passed here to the representatives of peace-loving Asian countries and the Chinese people.

    We unanimously express our sincere gratitude for your sympathy for the Japanese people in colonial status, your profound understanding and encouragement of the colonial struggle, and the enthusiastic invitation of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to us, and we are determined to do our best to save peace.

    日中友好协会平野义太郎等写信给郭沫若
    感谢中国人民对日本人民的同情和鼓舞
    【新华社十日讯】日中友好协会文化会议主席团平野义太郎、甘文芳、中岛健藏、村云大朴子等四人于九月十三日写信给郭沫若，对他在九月五日所写的“为亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开第二次给日本人民一封公开信”对日本人民的同情和鼓舞，表示感谢，并决心努力促进中日两国文化交流和拯救和平。该信摘要如下：
    我们非常高兴地接读了九月五日你写的“为亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开第二次给日本人民一封公开信”。
    我们感到今天日本和中国在文化方面的交流，对日本人民特别迫切需要，因此我们召开了日中友好文化会议。在会上，我们分门别类地检查了过去日中两国文化交流的成果，讨论了今后发展的各种条件和促进发展的方法。
    日本文化界现在面临着严重的危机。吉田政府变成了以亚洲为敌的帝国主义的奴仆，企图重建侵略亚洲的体制，使日本文化适应这个体制，造成充满腐朽和虚伪的所谓战争文化。
    我们切身体验到破坏日本的生活和文化的东西首先就是侵略战争。今天谁都知道，日本的繁荣要依靠和中国在经济上的交流，也就是要恢复和发展日中贸易。除去军事工业以外，从事于日本的一切和平工业的人，不论是工人或实业家，都衷心期望“中日贸易协议”能够实现，并在全国展开了促进贸易运动。
    日本文化现在被国际帝国主义腐朽堕落的文化摧残着。布满了六百多处军事基地的日本，到处都是赌博机器和向美、英军人卖笑的梆梆女郎。
    充满了杀人、淫荡和投机的荒淫无稽的美国影片，霸占了全国的电影院。
    然而，我们知道这种文化的本质是驱使日本走向毁灭的战争的手段。
    被当作“人类土拨鼠”来供原子弹实验的日本人民，憎恨军国主义的再起，保卫和平的运动与日俱增地强大起来了。日本人民也知道没有和平，日本人民就不可能得到幸福和繁荣。
    高良、宫腰、帆足三人从中国回来以后发表的谈话，日本人民最受感动的一部分是谈到中国人民如何真诚爱好和平，如何不记宿怨，向爱好和平的日本人民伸出友爱的手来。
    日本文化界深切关心中国的新文化，切望两国文化的交流。今天本会议的目的是委托出席不久将在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表把这里通过的各项报告和决议交给爱好和平的亚洲各国代表和中国人民。
    对于你对处在殖民地地位的日本人民的同情和对殖民地斗争的深刻理解和鼓舞，以及亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议对我们的热诚的邀请，我们一致表示诚心感谢，并有决心尽全力来拯救和平。
