Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 22nd. After more than two years of desperate war of aggression against Korea under the stolen name of the United Nations, the American aggressors are now using the United Nations Charter to cover up their crimes of undermining the Korean armistice negotiations. The US Information Service stated on the 15th: "The United Nations Command has consistently adhered to the moral principles based on the United Nations Charter throughout the Korean armistice negotiations." Acheson also praised the ruffians he sent to Panmunjom as negotiation representatives for "upholding the principles of the United Nations Charter" at the United Nations General Assembly on the 16th. However, the entire process of the Korean armistice negotiations proves that the American way of "upholding the principles of the United Nations Charter" is to completely undermine the principles of the United Nations Charter, refuse to resolve disputes through peaceful means, refuse to respect the national sovereignty of the other party, and unscrupulously pursue its military interests through military provocations and so-called military pressure in the armistice negotiations.

From the very beginning of the armistice negotiations, the US side showed no sincerity in resolving the issue in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. On the eleventh day after the start of the negotiations, namely July 21, 1951, eight American F-94 jet fighters blatantly invaded Chinese Northeast airspace to provoke, and seven were shot down on the spot by the Chinese People's Air Force. This shows that the US side attempted to use military pressure to strengthen their position in the negotiations.

Coordinating with these military provocations, the US side attempted to gain military interests at the negotiating table that they could not obtain at the front line. They boasted about their bankrupt "air and sea superiority" at the armistice negotiation meetings and shamelessly demanded compensation from the land in the negotiations, therefore, they demanded the establishment of a military demarcation line north of the existing battle line, attempting to occupy 12,000 square kilometers of our territory.

The US demand was so absurd that even Reuters reporters said: It is the first time in history that one of the belligerents has demanded territory in armistice negotiations based on air and sea power. Because this unreasonable demand was rejected, the US side continued to send aircraft to invade the Kaesong neutral zone, creating incidents of killing our guards in the neutral zone, and finally shamelessly bombing the residences of the Korean and Chinese delegations, attempting to murder our negotiators, which forced the negotiations to be suspended for two months. During this period, the US side launched the so-called "limited summer offensive" and "autumn offensive" on the front lines, and again hoped to use military pressure to seize what could not be obtained from the negotiations. Van Fleet clamored: "The only medicine for armistice negotiations is the victory of the United Nations forces."

However, the Korean and Chinese People's Army crushed the US offensive, which made the American aggressors a little more sober and sat down again for negotiations, and the issue of the military demarcation line was resolved because of our proposal for an on-the-spot ceasefire.

In the discussion of the third agenda item, the US side even more unreasonably demanded to send military personnel to inspect and conduct aerial reconnaissance of our rear, and attempted to interfere in our internal affairs, demanding to restrict the right of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to repair and build airports in its own territory. This is a blatant violation of the principle of respecting the sovereign equality of all countries in the United Nations Charter.

What is particularly intolerable is the US side's barbaric attitude on the issue of prisoners of war. Article 1 of the United Nations Charter stipulates: "To adjust or resolve international disputes or situations that may disrupt peace by peaceful means and in accordance with the principles of justice and international law." However, the US side completely abandoned the United Nations Charter, disregarded all international conventions and the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War signed by the United States itself, fabricated an absurd principle of "voluntary repatriation" out of thin air, and used all kinds of inhuman, Geneva Convention-violating abuse and insults to forcibly conduct unfounded "screenings" of prisoners of war, attempting to deprive prisoners of war of their right to be repatriated to their homes, and detain a large number of prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder for expanding the war of aggression. In their prisoner-of-war camps, batches of prisoners of war were massacred for refusing to be enslaved and demanding to be repatriated to their home countries, and even the International Committee of the Red Cross and American generals Dodd and Colson, who were loyal to the US government, could not deny this bloody atrocity. Just recently, 165 Chinese People's Volunteers captured on Jeju Island were beaten to death or injured for celebrating the National Day of their motherland. This has nothing in common with the principle of "promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all" in the United Nations Charter. This is completely unacceptable behavior under the moral principles of the United Nations Charter.

In order to force the Korean and Chinese sides to accept its unreasonable repatriation plan, the US side even took out heinous bacteriological weapons. This inhuman crime of the US side not only violates the 1925 Geneva Protocol, but also undermines the spirit of the United Nations Charter.

Obviously, the American aggressors came to the United Nations to recruit troops, attempting to force other countries in the United Nations to participate in the war of aggression against Korea under the name of "upholding the principles of the United Nations Charter" in order to win more profits for the bosses on Wall Street, and the facts have proved that the United States' various actions in the war of aggression against Korea and in the Korean armistice negotiations have barbarously undermined the principles and spirit of the United Nations Charter.

### 美方妄图以联合国宪章掩饰破坏谈判罪行

    美方妄图以联合国宪章掩饰破坏谈判罪行
    【新华社开城二十二日电】美国侵略者在盗窃联合国名义对朝鲜进行了两年多绝望的侵略战争以后，现在又拿联合国宪章来掩饰他们破坏朝鲜停战谈判的罪恶行为了。美国新闻处在十五日说：“联军司令部在整个朝鲜停战谈判过程中，一直是恪守联合国宪章以之为基础的道德原则的。”艾奇逊在十六日联合国大会上，也称赞他派到板门店来充当谈判代表的那些流氓“一直维护联合国宪章的原则”。但是朝鲜停战谈判的全部过程证明：美国方式的“维护联合国宪章原则”，就是彻底破坏联合国宪章原则，拒绝以和平方法解决争端，拒绝尊重对方的国家主权，并且在停战谈判中肆无忌惮地以军事挑衅和所谓军事压力，追求其军事利益。
    从停战谈判一开始，美方就表现了毫无按照联合国宪章原则来解决问题的诚意。在谈判开始以后的第十一天，即一九五一年七月二十一日，美国F—九十四式喷气战斗机八架公然侵入中国东北领空挑衅，当场被中国人民空军击落七架。这说明美方企图用军事压力来加强他们在谈判中的地位。
    在这种军事上的挑衅行为配合之下，美方就在谈判桌上企图得到他们在前线上不能得到的军事利益。他们在停战谈判会议上夸耀他们早已破产了的
    “海空军优势”，无耻地要求在谈判中从陆地上得到补偿，因此他们要求在现有战线以北设立军事分界线，企图侵占我方领土一万二千平方公里。
    美方这个要求是如此荒谬，以至路透社的记者都说：交战一方根据空中和海上的威力在停战谈判中要求领土，这还是历史上的第一次。由于这个无理的要求遭到拒绝，美方就不断以飞机侵入开城中立区，制造杀害中立区我方警卫人员的事件，最后竟无耻地轰炸朝中代表团住所，企图谋杀我方谈判代表，这迫使谈判停顿了两个月之久。在这期间，美方在前线发动了所谓“夏季目标有限的攻势”和“秋季攻势”，又希图用军事压力来夺取从谈判中所得不到的东西。范佛里特公然叫嚣：“停战谈判的唯一药剂，就是联合国军队的胜利。”
    可是朝中人民军队粉碎了美方的进攻，这才使美国侵略者头脑稍为清醒了些，再度坐下来进行谈判，军事分界线问题才因我方提出的就地停战办法而得以解决。
    在第三项议程的讨论上，美方更无理地要求派遣军事人员来对我方后方进行视察和空中侦察，并企图干涉我方内政，要求限制朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在自己境内修理和建筑飞机场的权利。这就粗暴地破坏了联合国宪章的尊重各国主权平等的原则。
    尤其令人不能容忍的是美方在战俘问题上的横蛮态度。联合国宪章第一条规定：“以和平方法并依正义及国际法之原则，调整或解决足以破坏和平之国际争端或情势。”可是美方完全抛弃了联合国宪章，置一切国际惯例和美国自己签字的一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约于脑后，凭空制造了一个“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则，用种种惨无人道，违反日内瓦公约的虐杀和侮辱来对战俘强迫进行毫无根据的“甄别”，企图剥夺战俘被遣返回家的权利，并扣留大批战俘充当扩大侵略战争的炮灰。在他们的战俘营里，整批整批的战俘因为拒绝被奴役、要求遣返祖国而遭到屠杀，就是效忠美国政府的红十字国际委员会和美国将军杜德、柯尔生都不能否认这种血腥的暴行。就在最近，济州岛上的中国人民志愿军被俘人员因为庆祝祖国国庆而被打死、打伤的有一百六十五人之多。这与联合国宪章的“增进并激励对于全体人类之人权及基本自由之尊重”的原则毫无相同之处，这完全是联合国宪章的道德原则所绝不能容许的行为。
    美方为了强迫朝中方面接受其无理的遣俘方案，甚至拿出了十恶不赦的细菌武器。美方这一灭绝人性的罪行不但是违背了一九二五年日内瓦议定书，同时也是破坏了联合国宪章的精神的。
    很显然，美国侵略者到联合国来招兵买马，企图用“维护联合国宪章原则”的名义，强迫联合国中其他国家参加侵朝战争，来替华尔街的老板们争得更多的利润，而事实证明，美国在它所发动侵朝战争中以及它在朝鲜停战谈判中的种种行动都是野蛮地破坏了联合国宪章的原则和精神的。
