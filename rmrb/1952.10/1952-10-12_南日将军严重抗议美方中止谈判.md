Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th - General Nam Il, our chief representative at the Korean armistice negotiations, lodged a strong protest today against the unreasonable and unilateral announcement by the U.S. side of an indefinite adjournment, thereby sabotaging the armistice negotiations. The full text is as follows:

On October 8th, you disregarded the reasonable proposal put forward by our side for a negotiated solution to the POW issue, unilaterally announced an indefinite adjournment, and abruptly left the meeting without waiting for our side to speak, decisively suspending the Korean armistice negotiations that are of concern to the world. This series of unreasonable actions on your part is clearly a blatant manifestation of your planned sabotage of the negotiations, which will absolutely not be tolerated by peace-loving people around the world.

Since the discussion of the POW issue began, your side has consistently insisted on the so-called voluntary repatriation, which is actually the forcible detention of prisoners of war, a complete violation of the 1949 Geneva Convention, and has never made any serious efforts to negotiate a solution to the problem. To realize this unreasonable demand, your side has taken a series of provocative actions inside and outside the conference room. This time, when our side put forward a reasonable plan sufficient to solve the POW issue, you refused to negotiate and suspended the negotiations. This is your premeditated plan, and an attempt to pressure the upcoming United Nations General Assembly to endorse your conspiracy to sabotage the negotiations and expand the war.

On our side, we have consistently advocated resolving all issues in the armistice negotiations through consultation on a fair and reasonable basis. Regarding the POW issue, which is currently the only obstacle to the Korean armistice, our side adheres to the just position of the Geneva Convention and the terms of the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both sides, and will never abandon the fair and reasonable principle of repatriating all prisoners of war. However, in order to find a solution to the problem, we have always maintained that the methods and steps for releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war can be negotiated. And this time, our proposal adopted your suggestion to send all prisoners of war to the demilitarized zone for exchange.

Our side's repeated efforts to negotiate a solution to the POW issue and your side's unreasonable refusal to negotiate and suspension of negotiations are in stark contrast. Facts speak louder than words, and your side cannot escape the serious responsibility for sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations. Regarding your actions of refusing to negotiate and suspending the negotiations, I am ordered to lodge a serious protest with your side. Your side must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    南日将军严重抗议美方中止谈判
    【新华社开城十一日电】朝鲜停战谈判我方首席代表南日将军十一日对美方无理片面宣布无限期休会，破坏停战谈判的事件，提出严重抗议，全文如下：
    十月八日你方置我方为协商解决遣俘问题而提出的合理方案于不顾，片面宣布无限期休会，未等我方发言即中途退出会场，断然中止了举世关心的朝鲜停战谈判。你方这一连串的无理行动，显然是你方有计划地破坏谈判的明白表现，全世界爱好和平的人民对此绝对不会予以容忍。
    自从讨论遣俘问题以来，你方一直坚持完全违反一九四九年日内瓦公约的所谓自愿遣返实即强迫扣留战俘的主张，从未作过任何认真的协商以解决问题的努力。为实现这一无理要求，你方在会场内外采取了一系列的挑衅行动。此次你方在我方提出足以解决遣俘问题的合理方案之际，竟而拒绝协商，中止谈判，实为你方预谋，并企图以此压迫即将开会的联合国大会赞同你方破坏谈判、扩大战争的阴谋。
    在我方方面，则一贯主张在公平合理的基础上协商解决停战谈判中的所有问题。就目前唯一阻碍着朝鲜停战的遣俘问题说，我方坚守日内瓦公约的正义立场及双方业已达成协议的停战协定草案条款，决不放弃双方遣返全部战俘的公平合理原则。但为求得问题的解决，对于释放与遣返全部战俘的方法与步骤，我方从来就主张可以协商。而这一次我方所提建议，就采纳了你方关于将全部战俘送至非军事区实行交换的意见。
    我方为解决战俘问题所作的多次协商努力与你方蛮不讲理拒绝协商中止谈判的行动，形成了鲜明强烈的对照。事实胜于雄辩，你方不能逃脱破坏朝鲜停战谈判的严重责任。对于你方拒绝协商中止谈判的行动，我奉命向你方提出严重抗议。你方必须对由此而产生的一切后果负完全的责任。
