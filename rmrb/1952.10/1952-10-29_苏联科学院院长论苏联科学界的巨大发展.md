Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th. Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, published an article in Pravda on the 23rd, discussing the great development of Soviet science. Nesmeyanov wrote: Soviet science is a constructive science. Soviet scientific research workers have surpassed the achievements of scientists in capitalist countries in many aspects and occupy the leading position in the world scientific community. The Soviet socialist system guarantees that the Soviet scientific community has the conditions and speed of development that capitalist countries do not and cannot have. Evidence of this is the great expansion of the Soviet scientific research institution network: it has doubled since the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Academy of Sciences has almost sixty times as many scientific research workers and a budget almost seven hundred times that of pre-revolutionary times. Since 1917, the number of scientific books published by the Soviet Academy of Sciences has increased nearly twenty-five times. The Soviet Academy of Sciences and its branches have become the largest scientific center in the world. There are twelve academies of sciences in the various republics, seven academies of sciences in various scientific fields, hundreds of scientific research institutes, and approximately nine hundred higher education institutions. The development of scientific institutions in the various republics is particularly rapid. Since the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has established ten academies of sciences in the republics and eleven branches of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. There has been a significant increase in the number of scientific workers in the national republics and national autonomous regions. For example, in Central Asia, where only 2% of the population was literate before the October Revolution, more than eighty higher education institutions, many scientific research institutes, and four republic academies of sciences have now been established; these four republic academies of sciences alone have twice as many scientific researchers as the entire Russian Empire. The number of people who have won Stalin Prizes for scientific achievements and inventions has been increasing year by year, with the Stalin Prizes awarded in 1950 being four times that of 1945. Nesmeyanov continued: The training of scientific personnel is a supremely important condition for scientific progress. The Soviet Union has more than 25,000 graduate students who continue their studies after graduating from university and are trained to engage in scientific research for life. In the Soviet Academy of Sciences alone, there are 2,500 graduate students from fifty-eight nationalities who are striving for master's and doctoral degrees. Nesmeyanov concluded: The further development of the various scientific departments of the Soviet Union, which have already achieved remarkable results, will bring Soviet science to its peak, while making the science of capitalist countries lag further behind. The Soviet socialist system and its rapid advance towards a communist society are sufficient to ensure that this will be the case in the future.

    苏联科学院院长论苏联科学界的巨大发展
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫院士二十三日在真理报发表一篇文章，论述苏联科学界的巨大发展。涅斯米扬诺夫写道：苏联科学是一种建设性的科学。苏联科学研究工作者在许多方面已超过了资本主义各国科学家的成就，在全世界科学界占第一把交椅。苏维埃社会主义制度，保证苏联科学界具备资本主义国家所没有而且也不可能有的条件和发展速度。这方面的证据便是苏联科学研究机关网的大大扩张：自从苏联共产党举行第十八次代表大会以来已增加了一倍。苏联科学院拥有差不多相当于革命前六十倍的科学研究工作者，预算差不多相当于革命前的七百倍。一九一七年以来，苏联科学院出版的科学图书已增加到将近二十五倍。苏联科学院及其分院已成为全世界最大的科学中心机关。各加盟共和国的科学院有十二个，各科学部门的科学院有七个，各种科学研究所有几百个，高等教育机关约九百个。各加盟共和国科学机关的发展特别迅速。在苏联共产党举行第十八次代表大会以来，苏联已创办了十个加盟共和国的科学院和十一个苏联科学院分院。各民族共和国和民族州区的科学工作人员已有显著的增加。例如，中亚细亚在十月革命前只有百分之二的人识字，现在那里已建立了八十多个高等教育机关、许多科学研究所和四个共和国的科学院了；单是这四个共和国的科学院，就拥有相当于沙皇俄国全国两倍的科学研究人员。因科学成就和发明而荣获斯大林奖金的人数逐年增多，一九五○年颁发的斯大林奖金就相当于一九四五年的四倍。涅斯米扬诺夫继续说：科学工作人员的训练是科学进步的无上重要条件，苏联有两万五千多名大学毕业后继续深造的研究生，为终身从事科学研究而受训练。单是苏联科学院中就有五十八个民族的二千五百名研究生，正在争取硕士和博士学位。涅斯米扬诺夫最后说：已经有了显著成就的苏联各科学部门的进一步发展，将使苏联科学登峰造极，而使资本主义国家的科学更加落在后面。苏联的社会主义制度及其向共产主义社会迅速迈进，足以确保将来的情形一定是这样。
