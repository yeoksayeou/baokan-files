    Indian Representative
    Govind Sahai's Speech (Abstract)
    I come from the land of Sakyamuni and Gandhi—two universally recognized apostles of peace and human friendship. We are traditionally, and by nature, a peace-loving people. We believe in the principle of living ourselves and letting others live. We, as a people, have condemned acts of aggression and foreign interference, and have supported the cause of peace, national self-determination, democracy, and national independence. We feel immense grief over the senseless war being waged in Korea and the use of the most inhumane weapons of mass murder to slaughter innocent people. The dragging out of the armistice negotiations and the systematic bombing of power plants during this period of armistice negotiations demonstrate the true nature of the vicious conspiracy adopted by American policymakers in this region. Their interference in Vietnam, recognition of the Chiang Kai-shek regime in Taiwan, blockade of China, prolongation of the Korean War with various pretexts, coupled with the remilitarization of Japan—all these are enough to convince us that their war conspiracy is organized and their acts of interference and aggression are systematic.
    The peace of the Asian and Pacific region is a matter of life and death for us. If we take a cold-eyed attitude toward these war conspiracies, our freedom will certainly be harmed.
    The Indian people believe that Japan's sovereignty and friendly relations between all Pacific Rim countries, especially between China and Japan, are two fundamental prerequisites for lasting peace in the Pacific Rim and Asian countries. The San Francisco "Treaty of Peace with Japan" and the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" completely disregard and violate these two basic elements of peace. They have become a threat not only to Japan but also to the countries of the Asian and Pacific region and to peace elsewhere in the world. A clear attempt by American war-mongers, colluding with Japanese militarists, is to turn Japan into a base of aggression to attack the people's movements for freedom in Asian countries.
    The Indian people congratulate the Japanese people on their growing and heroic struggle to defend peace, independence, and democracy, and to oppose the forces of aggression. Their movement is not only to save themselves, but also directly encourages the struggle of other Asian countries for peace, independence, and democracy. The Indian people guarantee their full moral support for the Japanese people's struggle for peace and national autonomy. The Indian people believe that the San Francisco "Treaty of Peace with Japan" as well as the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" and the "Administrative Agreement" are invalid and must be replaced by a genuine treaty signed by all relevant countries. This treaty should stipulate:
    (1) All foreign troops must withdraw, and no foreign country should be allowed to establish military bases on Japanese territory.
    (2) The Japanese people should enjoy complete sovereignty, and they should be guaranteed democratic and peaceful development.
    The Indian people have demonstrated their deep concern for peace, as they have condemned atrocities in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya.
    Our visit to China has been of great benefit to us and has refreshed our vision with the fresh vitality of thought and life. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our Chinese hosts—they have prepared an opportunity for all of us to discuss and consider issues related to our mutual interests together in an atmosphere of freedom and harmony. After returning home, we must expand and deepen our activities, and fully mobilize peace-loving people all over the world to confront total war and oppose the forces of war and aggression.

    印度代表
    高文德·萨海的发言（摘要）
    我来自释迦牟尼与甘地的国土——两位全世界公认的和平与人类友好的使徒。我们在传统上，在性情上，都是一个爱好和平的民族。我们相信自己生活也让别人生活的原则。我们以人民的身份谴责过侵略行为和外国的干涉，并且支持过和平事业、民族自决、民主和民族独立。我们对于在朝鲜进行的无意义的战争和利用最惨无人道的杀人武器来屠杀无辜人民的行动，感到莫大的悲痛。停战谈判的拖延和在这停战谈判的时期内有系统地轰炸发电厂的行动，都显示出美国决策者在这个地区所采取的恶毒的阴谋的真正本质。他们干涉越南，承认台湾蒋介石政权，封锁中国，以种种藉口来延长朝鲜战争，再加上使日本重新军国主义化——这一切都足以使我们相信他们的战争阴谋是有组织的，他们的干涉和侵略的行为是有系统的。
    亚洲及太平洋区域的和平对我们来说具有生死存亡的意义。假如我们对这些战争阴谋采取冷眼旁观的态度，我们的自由一定会受到损害。
    印度人民认为日本的主权和一切太平洋沿岸国家间的友好关系，特别是中国与日本间的友好关系，是太平洋沿岸和亚洲各国持久和平的两个基本的先决条件。旧金山“对日和约”与“美日安全条约”完全不顾并违反了这两个和平的基本要素。它们成了不仅是对日本，同时也是对一切亚洲及太平洋区域的国家以及世界其他地方的和平的一种威胁。美国战争贩子们与日本军国主义分子们勾结的一个明显的企图，就是要把日本变为侵略基地以进攻亚洲各国人民的争取自由的运动。
    印度人民祝贺日本人民保卫和平、独立和民主与反对侵略势力的日益高涨的英勇斗争。他们的运动不单是为了拯救他们自己，而且是直接鼓励了其他亚洲国家争取和平、独立和民主的斗争。印度人民保证在道义上全力支持日本人民为和平及民族自主的斗争。印度人民认为，旧金山“对日和约”以及
    “美日安全条约”和“行政协定”是无效的，而必须用一切有关国家所签订的真正和约来代替。这个和约中应规定：
    （一）一切外国军队必须撤退，任何外国都不许在日本领土上建立军事基地。
    （二）日本人民应享有完整的主权，并应保证他们有民主与和平的发展。
    印度人民已经证明了他们对和平的深切关怀，因为他们谴责了在朝鲜、越南和马来亚的种种暴行。
    我们这次来访问中国使我们得到极大的好处，也使我们眼界一新，看到了思想和生活的新鲜活力。我愿对于我们中国的主人致以衷心的感谢——他们为我们所有的人准备了一个机会，使我们能够在自由和融洽的空气里一起讨论和考虑有关我们相互的利益的问题。我们在回国以后，必须扩大和加深我们的活动，把全世界爱好和平的人民都全面动员起来，来对抗全面战争，并反对战争和侵略的势力。     （新华社）
