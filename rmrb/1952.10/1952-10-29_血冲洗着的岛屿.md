    Island Washed in Blood
    Ai Qing
    
    Geoje Island, Jeju Island, a murderous aura fills the islands, American soldiers rampage, as if on a battlefield. Patton tanks drive into the POW camps, flaunting their might before unarmed prisoners of war, this is the fascist "moral standard," treating the most despicable acts as "glory." Whether it's Clark or Van Fleet, they are all hooligans wielding weapons as "heroes," persecuting prisoners of war is their accomplishment, hoping to make a great contribution to sabotaging the negotiations. They put sand in the ration bags, wanting to starve the unyielding people to death; in order to realize their despicable plan [Note], many prisoners of war are executed every day. They forbid the prisoners of war to sing freely, forbid them to walk with their chests held high, forbid them to commemorate their motherland's festivals, forbid them to return to their hometowns. Day in and day out, flustered, the executioners reveal their cowardly faces, killing people and then not daring to admit it, saying "they put the rope around their own necks." Whether killed or starved, they did not die! Those who die for justice do not die! No matter how cruel American imperialism is, the will to resist will never die! When the day of revenge comes, the island of death will be reborn, the sunlight of freedom shining on the sea, waves carrying the songs of victory...
    
    [Note] Refers to the American imperialist conspiracy to hand over the prisoners of war to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek.

    血冲洗着的岛屿
    艾青巨济岛，济州岛，岛上杀气腾天，美国兵横冲直闯，好像上了战场。巴顿式坦克开进了战俘营，在徒手的战俘面前显威风，这就是法西斯的“道德标准”，把最卑鄙的行为当作“光荣”。不管克拉克还是范佛里特，都是流氓拿了武器当“英雄”，迫害战俘是他们的业绩，想在破坏谈判里立大功。在口粮袋里装进了沙子，想把不屈服的人们饿死；为了实现卑鄙的计划〔注〕，每天有许多战俘被处死。他们不准战俘自由歌唱，不准战俘走路挺着胸膛，不准战俘纪念祖国的节日，不准战俘回到自己的家乡。一天到晚慌慌张张，刽子手露着卑怯的嘴脸，杀死了又不敢承认，说是“自己把绳子套上脖子”。无论杀死饿死都没有死！为正义而死的人没有死！美帝国主义再怎么残忍，反抗的意志永远不会死！等复仇的日子来临，死亡之岛将要重生，自由的阳光照耀着海水，波浪里传出胜利的歌声……〔注〕指美帝国主义阴谋要将战俘交给李承晚和蒋介石。
