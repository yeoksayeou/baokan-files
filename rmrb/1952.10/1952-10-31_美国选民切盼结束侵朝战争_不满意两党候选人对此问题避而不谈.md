Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 26th: TASS, New York, October 23rd—The struggle between the Democratic and Republican candidates in the United States has become increasingly fierce. Candidates from both parties and their supporters are constantly giving speeches to American voters. According to a reader of the "Compass Daily", they gave voters "a lot of sweet promises" in their speeches. However, whether it is Stevenson or Eisenhower, they all avoid the issues that every ordinary American voter is most concerned about, such as quickly ending the Korean War, reducing taxes, and stopping inflation.

Even American bourgeois newspapers have to call the Korean War issue a "forgotten issue," and at the same time have to admit that it is the issue that all levels of people in the United States are most anxious about.

A recent issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine wrote: "All indications show that the Korean War issue currently has the greatest impact on voters... In 1952, the war issue included many aspects. War means drafting 47,000 young people into the army every month, thus causing panic and anxiety in the families of millions of young people of draft age. War means weekly increases in personnel losses, bringing sorrow to the families, friends, and neighbors of the dead... Accompanying the war are high taxes and rising living expenses. The absence of victory prospects and the endless war has also caused feelings of despair. According to politicians, the Korean issue has deepened the disappointment and dissatisfaction of many people. The Democratic Party and Stevenson are trying to evade responsibility for the war. The Republican Party is trying its best to push the responsibility for the war onto the Democratic Party."

"Inquirer" commentator Rubel recently traveled all over the country to understand the mood of voters. After returning, he wrote a series of articles on this issue, which were published in various American newspapers. Rubel came to a conclusion as a result of talking with many representatives from all walks of life: "What really worries most American people is the issue of war and peace, the threat of business depression and inflation." Rubel also pointed out: "The issue of drafting young people into the Korean War is one of the issues in the election campaign that causes the most resentment against the government...."

"Wall Street Journal" reporter Harling, stationed in Evansville (Indiana), also talked about the mood of the voters. Explaining the mood of the farmers in the vicinity of Vanderburgh, Indiana, he wrote: "What worries the farmers the most is the Korean War issue and how to stop the war." Quoting a certain official, Harling wrote: Farmers generally believe that those billionaires are delaying the war in order to maintain the production of munitions. Farmer voters, like all other voters, cannot find answers to their anxious questions in Eisenhower and Stevenson's ingratiating campaign speeches.

An editorial in the "Eastern Farmers Union News" wrote: Farmer voters have not heard the Democratic and Republican candidates' "promises to achieve genuine world peace and end the senseless Korean massacre. They have not proposed negotiations between major powers to resolve existing differences, unrestricted trade between countries around the world, upholding the principles of the United Nations Charter, and assisting colonial peoples in gaining freedom and independence."

### 美国选民切盼结束侵朝战争  不满意两党候选人对此问题避而不谈

    美国选民切盼结束侵朝战争
    不满意两党候选人对此问题避而不谈
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：美国民主党与共和党候选人之间的斗争已日益激烈。两党候选人和他们的支持者不断向美国选民发表演说。据“指南针日报”的一个读者表示，他们在演说中给选民以“大量甜蜜的诺言”。但是，不管是史蒂文森还是艾森豪威尔，对每一个普通美国选民最着急的问题，如迅速结束朝鲜战争、减轻捐税、制止通货膨胀等问题都避而不谈。
    甚至美国资产阶级报纸也不得不把朝鲜战争问题称为“被遗忘了的问题”，同时也不得不承认它是美国各阶层人民最焦虑的问题。
    最近一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志写道：“一切迹象表明：目前朝鲜战争问题对选民的影响最大……。在一九五二年，战争问题包括许多方面。战争意味着每月要征召四万七千名青年入伍，因此使千百万有役龄青年的家庭惊恐不安。战争意味着每周增长的人员损失，给死者的家庭、朋友和邻居带来悲哀……伴随着战争而来的是高额的捐税和生活费用的上升。没有胜利远景和没有止境的战争还引起了人们的绝望的情绪。据政治家们的意见，朝鲜问题加深了许多人的失望和不满情绪。民主党和史蒂文森企图逃避战争的责任。共和党则竭力把战争责任推到民主党身上。”
    “问询报”的评论员鲁贝尔不久以前曾遍访全国各地了解选民情绪，回来以后，他就这个问题写了一系列的文章，刊登在美国各报上。鲁贝尔和社会各阶层的许多代表谈话的结果得到一个结论：“使大多数美国人民真正感到不安的就是战争与和平的问题，是商业萧条和通货膨胀的威胁。”鲁贝尔同时指出：“征召青年入伍参加朝鲜战争的问题，是竞选运动中那些最使人对政府感到愤慨的问题之一。……”
    “华尔街日报”驻伊凡斯维尔（印第安纳州）记者海林也谈到了选民们的这种情绪。他说明印第安纳州梵德尔堡近郊的农民的情绪说：“最使农民们不安的是朝鲜战争问题和如何停止战争的问题。”海林引用某一官方人士的话写道：农民们普遍认为，那些亿万富翁在拖延战争，以维持军火的生产。农民选民们像其他所有的选民一样，他们所焦虑的问题在艾森豪威尔和史蒂文森那些笼络人心的竞选演说中找不到回答。
    “东方农民联盟报”的一篇社论写道：农民选民们直到现在没有听到民主党与共和党的候选人“要取得真正的世界和平、结束无谓的朝鲜屠杀的诺言。他们没有提出大国进行谈判以解决现存分歧的问题，没有提出世界各国之间不受限制地进行贸易，维护联合国宪章原则、协助殖民地人民获得自由和独立的问题”。
