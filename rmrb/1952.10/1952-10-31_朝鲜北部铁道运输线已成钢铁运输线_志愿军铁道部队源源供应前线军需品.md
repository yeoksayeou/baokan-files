Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 30th - The northern Korean railway transport line has become an indestructible steel transport line. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps and anti-aircraft artillery units, with the assistance of the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, have overcome enemy air raids, destruction, and natural difficulties. They have not only ensured a continuous supply of military supplies to the front but also helped the Korean people overcome some of the difficulties in wartime material life.

For the past two years, the U.S. invading air force has carried out frantic and severe bombing and destruction of the northern Korean railway transport line, but it has not achieved its goal of cutting off northern Korean railway transportation. In the early days of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's entry into Korea, most of the northern Korean railways and bridges were destroyed by enemy aircraft. The commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps bravely overcame the enemy's harassment and the difficulties of severe cold, and quickly built bridges, ensuring the smooth flow of the railway transport line. During the floods last year, enemy aircraft carried out a so-called "strangulation war" in the Anju, Kasan, and Sunchon triangle area, bombing a vital area of our railway transportation day and night. A short section of the line guarded by a certain unit was attacked by enemy aircraft three to five times a day. However, thanks to the unit's commanders and fighters' day and night efforts to repair it, the train still ran as usual. In the struggle to overcome the enemy's so-called "key bombing" this spring, a bridge guarded by the seventh company of a certain unit was subjected to continuous concentrated bombing by enemy aircraft, with a total of more than 7,000 heavy bombs dropped. However, the company's commanders and fighters fought heroically for seventy-six days and nights, always ensuring that trains passed every night. As a result, the company was awarded a collective second-class merit. In the heroic struggle against enemy aircraft, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps also produced many heroes who rushed to unload time bombs. For example, Guo Jinsheng, a first-class fighter of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and a special-class meritorious person, has removed more than 600 time bombs and cluster bombs and extracted 15,000 kilograms of explosives from the bombs, worth more than 160 million yuan in RMB. He also taught 43 people how to dismantle time bombs.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps not only fought against enemy aircraft but also against the floods and snow of nature. In July and August last year, Korea experienced the largest flood in more than 40 years, and the soldiers engaged in a heroic battle with the floods. Yang Liandi, a martyr who had already sacrificed his life and a famous first-class people's hero in China, commanded a platoon at that time to bravely and skillfully build a floating bridge three times in the raging waves of the Qingchuan River, which flowed at a speed of six meters per second, ensuring the smooth flow of the transport line during the flood. When building a certain bridge, Liu Jike, a member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League of the sixth company of a certain unit, led a group to create a record of one person digging 3.5 cubic meters of frozen soil in one night. Platoon leader Qiu Fengzhang led a platoon to chisel open the solid ice in order to lay wooden cages in the middle of the river to fill the foundation. He worked barefoot in the ice river for nine hours and finally successfully completed the task.

In the tense and arduous struggle for repairs, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps also launched a rationalization proposal movement, which greatly improved the technical level and improved the organization of construction. Han Futang, a first-class meritorious person from a certain unit, created a "I-beam sliding control machine," which not only avoided any danger in the bridge construction project but also saved half of the manpower and shortened the erection time by two-thirds. Qi Guozhen, deputy company commander of a certain unit, and others collectively created a "universal gauge ruler," which can replace several tools such as a gauge ruler, a level ruler, and a superelevation ruler. Peng Naijiu, deputy company commander and second-class meritorious person from a certain unit, and others created an "adjustable screw wrench," which overcame the difficulties of intermediate repairs and increased work efficiency four times compared with the original.

In order to save the country's resources, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps also enthusiastically launched a movement to obtain materials locally, collect waste materials and discarded materials, and make tools and materials themselves. According to statistics from January last year to August this year alone, the collected steel rails can be used to build a 200-kilometer-long line, and the salvaged and repaired steel beams can be used to build two Yellow River iron bridges. The collected, salvaged, and self-made materials can fill 4,681 train cars, worth more than 190 billion yuan, which can be used to purchase 128 fighter jets.

    朝鲜北部铁道运输线已成钢铁运输线
    志愿军铁道部队源源供应前线军需品
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十日电】朝鲜北部的铁道运输线已成为一条炸不断、打不烂的钢铁运输线。中国人民志愿军铁道部队与高射炮部队在朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军的协助下，战胜了敌机的轰炸破坏和自然界的困难，不但做到将大量军需物资源源地供应前线，并且帮助朝鲜人民克服了一部分战时物质生活的困难。
    两年来，美国侵朝空军对朝鲜北部的铁道运输线进行了疯狂的严重的轰炸破坏，但是并没有达到它断绝朝鲜北部铁道运输的目的。在中国人民志愿军入朝初期，朝鲜北部铁路、桥梁大部被敌机炸毁。志愿军铁道部队的指战员们英勇地战胜了敌机的袭扰与严寒的困难，很快修建起一座座桥梁来，保证了铁路运输线的畅通。去年洪水期间，敌机在安州、价川、顺川三角地区进行所谓“绞杀战”，日夜轰炸我军铁路运输的一个咽喉地带。仅某部守卫的一段短短的线路，就每天遭敌机三次到五次的空袭。但在该部指战员日日夜夜的紧张抢修下，仍旧保持了火车的照常通行。今年春天在战胜敌机所谓“重点轰炸”的斗争中，某部第七连守卫的某座桥梁曾遭受敌机连续集中轰炸，共落重磅炸弹七千多枚，但该连指战员英勇奋斗七十六昼夜，始终保证每夜通车。该连因而荣立集体二等功一次。在与敌机的英勇斗争中，中国人民志愿军铁道部队还出现了许多抢卸定时炸弹的英雄人物。如朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一级战士荣誉勋章获得者、特等功臣郭金升，曾先后卸除定时炸弹、子母弹等六百多枚，从炸弹中取出炸药一万五千公斤，价值人民币一亿六千多万元。他并且教会了四十三人拆卸定时炸弹。
    中国人民志愿军铁道部队不仅与敌机作斗争，且要与自然界的洪水和冰雪作斗争。去年七、八月间朝鲜发生了四十多年来最大的一次洪水，战士们与洪水展开了英勇的搏斗。已经牺牲的烈士、全中国著名的一级人民英雄杨连第，当时曾指挥一个排在清川江每秒钟流速六公尺的惊涛骇浪中，英勇机智地先后搭架浮桥三次，保证了洪水期间运输线的畅通。在修建某座桥梁时，某部第六连中国新民主主义青年团团员刘继可带领一个组，创造了一人一夜挖冻土三点五立方公尺的最高纪录。排长仇凤章为了在江心下木笼填基础，曾带领一个排凿开坚冰。赤身钻入冰河中工作九个小时，终于胜利地完成任务。
    在紧张艰苦的抢修斗争中，中国人民志愿军铁道部队还开展了合理化建议运动，因而大大地提高了技术水平和改善了施工组织。某部一等功臣韩福堂创造了“工字梁滑动管制机”，不但避免了架桥工程中的任何危险，而且节省人力二分之一，缩短架设时间三分之二。某部副连长齐国珍等集体创造了“万能道尺”可以代替道尺、水平尺、超高尺等几种工具。某部副连长二等功臣彭耐久等创造了“活动螺丝搬子”，克服了中间抢修的困难，使作业效率比原来提高四倍。
    为了节省祖国资财，中国人民志愿军铁道部队并热烈地开展了就地取材、搜集废材弃材和自造工具材料的运动。仅据自去年一月至今年八月的统计，搜集的钢轨可修一条二百公里长的线路，打捞、修理的钢梁可筑两座黄河大铁桥。搜集、打捞和自制的材料，可装四千六百八十一个车皮，价值一千九百多亿元，可购买战斗机一百二十八架。
