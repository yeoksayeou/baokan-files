    The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and various democratic parties sent a telegram to General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, congratulating the Korean People's Army and the Korean people on their great victory over the American aggressors in the past two years. The telegram is as follows:
    To General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army:

    On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting alongside the Korean People's Army against American aggression, we would like to express our highest combat salute on behalf of the Chinese people to you and all the heroic Korean People's Army, and to the Korean people who are bravely resisting American aggression.

    The long-standing friendship between the people of Korea and China has been further consolidated and developed in the common struggle against American aggression. This fraternal friendship is the most reliable guarantee for us to defeat the enemy.

    In the past two years, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have been closely united, fighting bravely, and achieving great victories, defending the independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, defending China's security, defending peace in the Far East and the world, and inspiring all peace-loving people in the world. The heroic Korean People's Army and the victorious struggle of the Korean people against the aggressors have won the respect and love of all peace-loving people in the world.

    American imperialism is still not reconciled to its failure. It is continuing to sabotage the armistice negotiations and plotting to expand the war of aggression. It recently suspended the armistice negotiations in a brazen manner by declaring an indefinite recess, attempting to use this to pressure its puppet countries in the United Nations General Assembly to agree to a plan to expand the war of aggression. But the conspiracy of American imperialism is bound to fail. We, the Chinese people, will continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and strive to support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and strive for the realization of the Korean armistice on a fair and reasonable basis, and for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

    We believe that the people of Korea and China, with the sympathy and support of all peace-loving people in the world, will surely be able to crush the shameless conspiracy of American imperialism, victoriously end the Korean War, and stop the expansion of the war of aggression.

    Long live the heroic Korean People's Army and the Korean people!
    Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the people of Korea and China!

    中国人民政协全国委员会和各民主党派
    致电金日成将军祝贺胜利
    【新华社二十四日讯】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会和各民主党派致电朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军，祝贺朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民两年来抗击美国侵略者的伟大胜利。电文如下：朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军：
    值此中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩反抗美国侵略的两周年纪念日，我们谨代表中国人民向您和全体英勇的朝鲜人民军，向英勇反抗美国侵略的朝鲜人民，致以崇高的战斗的敬意。
    朝、中两国人民之间具有悠久历史的友谊，已在反对美国侵略的共同斗争中更加巩固和发展起来。这种兄弟友谊就是我们战胜敌人的最可靠的保证。
    两年来，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军亲密团结，英勇作战，取得了伟大的胜利，保卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立，保卫了中国的安全，保卫了远东及世界的和平，鼓舞了全世界一切爱好和平的人民。英勇的朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民的打击侵略者的胜利斗争，已获得了全世界一切爱好和平的人民的尊敬和爱戴。
    美帝国主义现在仍然不甘心于自己的失败，它正在继续破坏停战谈判，阴谋扩大侵略战争。它最近已蛮横地以宣布无限期休会的方法，中止了停战谈判，企图借此在联合国大会上压迫其仆从国家同意扩大侵略战争的计划。但是美帝国主义的阴谋是一定要失败的。我们中国人民将继续加强抗美援朝的工作，努力支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，为争取在公平合理的基础上实现朝鲜停战，并和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗。
    我们相信，朝、中两国人民，在全世界一切爱好和平的人民的同情与支持下，一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的无耻阴谋，胜利地结束朝鲜战争，制止侵略战争的扩大。
    英勇的朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民胜利万岁！
    朝中两国人民的牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
