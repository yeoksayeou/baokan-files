Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th (TASS): The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) continued its sessions on the 11th. The morning session was chaired by Shayahmetov. The meeting continued to discuss the report made by N.S. Khrushchev on the draft revision of the Charter of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). K.P. Zhukov from the Voronezh region spoke first.

Zhukov said that the revision of the Party Charter was necessary because life itself demanded it. The purpose of the revision is to further strengthen the leading role of the Party.

Approximately 20,000 Communist Party members participated in Party meetings and district, city, and regional Party representative conferences to discuss the draft revision of the Party Charter. They all warmly endorsed the draft and put forward opinions and suggestions, demonstrating great concern for strengthening Party unity, consolidating the Party ranks, and increasing the vanguard role of Communist Party members in socialist development.

Zhukov described the work of the Voronezh regional Party organization, and he also said that despite the enormous damage caused by the German fascist aggressors in this region, the level of industrial and agricultural production in the region now greatly exceeds that of the pre-war period.

Zhukov concluded by describing the Voronezh regional Party organization's infinite loyalty and unity to the great cause of Lenin and Stalin.

Comrade Bokov from Saratov described the Party's tremendous and unshakable prestige among the people.

The broad masses of working people have a deep confidence in the Party's cause just as they do in their own cause; they are following the Party and their leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin.

Bokov said that Communist Party members of the Saratov Party organization unanimously endorsed the draft revision of the Party Charter. They pointed out at their meetings that this Party document stipulates the main tasks of the Party, the duties and rights of Communist Party members, and it is permeated with Stalin's concern for carrying out Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism and for maintaining the Party's unbreakable unity.

Bokov quoted some opinions and supplements to the draft revision of the Party Charter put forward by Communist Party members. He said that the new Party Charter reflects the thoughts and aspirations of the broad masses of Party members, and it serves the cause of building communism. Communism is our tomorrow, and no force in the world can prevent the Soviet people from marching towards the final victory of communism.

Next to speak was Fedor Kuznetsov, a representative from Moscow. He said that the revised Party Charter summarizes the rich experience accumulated by the Party in its development since the 18th Congress; it develops and specifies the basic organizational principles of the Party to adapt to the new tasks of communist construction.

Kuznetsov said that the extensive discussion of the documents submitted to the 19th Congress by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) by Party organizations in the army further enhanced the creativity, initiative, and enthusiasm of Party members, and helped to expose and eliminate shortcomings in the Party's work.

During the discussion of the draft, Communist Party members in the army particularly emphasized the enormous importance of the provisions in the revised Party Charter regarding ideological work and mastering Marxism-Leninism. The speaker urged everyone to pay attention to Stalin's words: if our army has a sufficient number of well-tempered cadres, our army will be invincible.

The draft revision of the Party Charter shows that the responsibility of Party members to fulfill their obligations to the Party has increased. In the army, this means that every Communist Party member must have superior military and political training and must be a model of high military discipline. Kuznetsov emphasized the importance of the task stipulated in the new Party Charter of extremely strengthening the Soviet Union's active defense against the aggressive actions of its enemies.

Kuznetsov concluded by assuring the Congress that political workers and Party organizations in the Soviet army will diligently strive to strictly follow the new Party Charter to cultivate Communist Party members.

Cheprakov, a representative from the Sakhalin region, said: Thanks to the help and care of the Party, the government, and Comrade Stalin, Communist Party members and all the working people of the Sakhalin region have done a lot of work in eliminating the consequences of the Japanese aggressors' plundering rule. In a very short period, factories of all sizes have been restored, and the previously backward coal mines, fishing grounds, and paper mills have been rebuilt and equipped with modern machinery. Cities and district centers are expanding and improving.

Cheprakov went on to explain the great significance of the revisions made in the Party Charter. In the work of carrying out the great task of building communism, the guiding and leading role of our Party and the role of every Communist Party member have been infinitely enhanced. The new Party Charter greatly improves the Party's combat effectiveness.

Cheprakov said that the work of the Sakhalin Party organization has shortcomings. Communist Party members of the Sakhalin region will make every necessary effort to eliminate these shortcomings as soon as possible and fulfill the tasks they are responsible for. They will, together with all the Soviet people, raise their vigilance, strengthen national defense, and make every necessary effort to prevent interference by the American and Japanese aggressors and other enemies of our country who are building communism for the peaceful labor of the Soviet people.

Vagapov, a representative of the Bashkir Autonomous Republic, began his speech by talking about the Party's wise Leninist-Stalinist national policy, thanks to which the various nationalities of the Soviet Union have become advanced socialist nations. He cited the Bashkir Autonomous Republic as an example, which has become a developed industrial region of the Soviet Union with large-scale socialist agriculture.

When talking about the new revised Party Charter, Vagapov emphasized that the new Party Charter will further strengthen the role of Party organizations and every Party member.

The historic documents submitted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the 19th Congress for discussion have aroused a new political and labor upsurge among Party members and all the working people in the Bashkir Autonomous Republic. More than 40,000 members of the Bashkir regional Party organization participated in the discussion of the draft revision of the Party Charter.

Vagapov concluded by saying that the Bashkir regional Party organization, like our entire Party, is closely united and participates in the 19th Congress with loyalty to the Party Central Committee and Comrade Stalin. It is prepared to continue to carry out all the tasks assigned by the Party and its beloved leader, Comrade Stalin.

Rumyantsev, a representative of the Velikiye Luki region, emphasized that the draft revision of the Party Charter reflects the new and greater tasks of communist construction, and the new and greater demands of the Party on every Party member in this regard. He said that this document was unanimously endorsed at all Party meetings. The discussion of the documents submitted to the 19th Congress by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union greatly strengthened the work of Party organizations. Party members criticized the work of their Party committees, Party and Soviet organizations, and responsible personnel according to the higher requirements of the new draft Party Charter.

Rumyantsev concluded by assuring the 19th Congress that in the face of new historical tasks, the Velikiye Luki Party organization will be more closely united around the Leninist-Stalinist Party Central Committee and the great Stalin.

Kakarov, a representative of the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Republic, said that the 19th Congress unanimously endorsed the Central Committee's political line and its practical work, thereby expressing the will of our entire heroic Party.

The Soviet people, infinitely loyal to the Bolshevik Party, voluntarily entrust their fate to the Party, because they know that the Leninist-Stalinist Party has no other interests than the interests of the people, and they know that the Party is leading them to overcome all the difficulties encountered on the road and to victoriously march towards the great goal of communism.

Kakarov cited vivid facts to illustrate the unprecedented progress made by this autonomous republic since the establishment of the Soviet government. Due to the resolute implementation of the Leninist-Stalinist national policy, the Buryat-Mongol people established a state and became a socialist nation. Kakarov said that we owe all this to the Communist Party, to the Soviet government, and to the great leader, Comrade Stalin.

All Party organizations discussed the draft revision of the Party Charter and generally expressed their endorsement, because these revisions reflect the rich experience gained by the Party in the development of the Party.

Pitychenko, a representative of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, said that the immortal cause of Lenin and Stalin has become the cause of all Soviet people in our country, because the working masses regard the Communist Party as their Party, as their own beloved Party, and they are deeply concerned about strengthening this Party. Pitychenko said that Communist Party members and all the working people in the Ukrainian capital warmly welcomed the documents submitted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the 19th Party Congress. In Kiev, more than 3,000 Party meetings discussed the documents of the Congress. Communist Party members put forward many suggestions at the meetings. Pitychenko cited specific examples from the work of the Kiev Party organization to illustrate the importance of the provisions in the Party Charter regarding probationary Party members.

He said that the draft revision of the Party Charter is a document of great historical significance. The new tasks facing our Party in the period of gradual transition from socialism to communism in our country require the formulation of such a Party Charter.

Chairman Shayahmetov announced that the Congress had received a congratulatory telegram from the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States. The delegates to the Congress responded with a stormy and prolonged applause. Everyone stood up.

Shayahmetov went on to say that the members of the delegation of the Communist Party of the United States could not attend the Congress because "American democracy" would not allow them to attend; the U.S. government refused to issue visas to the delegation of the Communist Party of the United States.

Batorichev read out the full text of the congratulatory telegram. The reading of the congratulatory telegram was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause.

The congratulatory telegram congratulated the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, pointed out the great role played by the Soviet Union in defeating Hitlerism and defending international peace and democracy, and hailed the Soviet Union's outstanding achievements in national industrialization and socialist construction.

The majority of the American people want peace and sincerely hope to establish friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union. The members of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States wrote that they know that the people of the world can prevent the new world war being prepared by the American imperialists. The people of all countries will do everything possible to achieve this great goal. (Stormy, prolonged applause. Everyone stood up.)

Next on stage was Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. He was welcomed by the delegates and guests of the Congress with a stormy and prolonged applause. Wilhelm Pieck, on behalf of the German people and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, extended warm, fraternal, and militant greetings to the Congress. He expressed gratitude for the great assistance given by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, especially J.V. Stalin, to the German Democratic Republic in its construction. The demonstration held by 600,000 working people in Berlin on October 7 this year—which was also watched by the Soviet government delegation led by Comrade Shvernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union—was a manifestation of the German people's cherishing and striving for friendship with the Soviet Union, and also a manifestation of the German people's respect for Comrade Stalin.

Wilhelm Pieck continued, our Party faces significant tasks in the struggle for peace and the unification of Germany, and against the war plans of the American imperialists. The American imperialists want to impose a militaristic general treaty on West Germany and drag it into the aggressive Atlantic Treaty system. American imperialism vainly attempts to turn West Germany into a military base in Europe and force the German people onto a bloody path of fratricidal war.

In contrast, the Soviet government, in its note to the three Western powers, pointed out concrete and acceptable methods for a peaceful solution to the German question.

Wilhelm Pieck said that we have organized a broad popular movement to strive for mutual understanding in Germany. The Presidium of the West German Federal Assembly had to receive a delegation elected by our People's Chamber and listen to the opinions that the delegation had to express.

The German people want to live a peaceful life in their own unified country, and no force in the world can deny these 70 million people the right to exist as a nation. This statement caused prolonged applause.

We have built the German Democratic Republic into a base for the struggle for peace and a unified Germany.

Wilhelm Pieck concluded by hailing the great communist architect J.V. Stalin. This again caused cheers throughout the venue. The whole audience stood up.

Uruguayan Communist Party Secretary Arismendi, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Uruguayan Communist Party, congratulated the Congress and the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, J.V. Stalin. Arismendi was warmly welcomed by the delegates. Arismendi said that the American imperialists, with the help of the landlords, their lackeys, big capitalists, and merchants, vainly attempt to turn Uruguay into a base for aggressive war, a source of cannon fodder, and a supply of raw materials for their monopoly capital. The Uruguayan proletariat and all the people are loudly opposing this criminal activity, and they are declaring more and more loudly that they will never serve as cannon fodder in the anti-Soviet aggressive war that the imperialists are preparing.

Arismendi concluded by hailing the Congress, J.V. Stalin, and the friendship between the Uruguayan people and the great Soviet people, to which the entire venue responded with stormy applause.

Groot, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Netherlands, extended congratulations to the Congress, and the delegates warmly welcomed him.

He said, please allow me in particular to express my deep gratitude for the victory you have achieved under the command of the unprecedentedly great general, Comrade Stalin, in defeating German fascism and Japanese militarism.

We are convinced that we can say this not only on behalf of our Party, but also on behalf of the majority of the Dutch people whom you have liberated from the enslavement of the terrible Hitlerite bandits. The people of our country will always remember everything that the great and powerful Soviet Union has done for them.

As a symbol of gratitude, Groot presented the Presidium of the Congress with a flag from the Amsterdam Party organization, which was inscribed with the words "The Dutch people will never fight the Soviet Union." The entire venue stood up. Stormy applause resounded throughout the hall.

Hagberg, Chairman of the Communist Party of Sweden, was warmly welcomed by the delegates.

He said, in the history of mankind, there has never been a person who has had such great significance for so many people as Comrade Stalin. (Stormy applause)

I take this opportunity to express the deep gratitude and admiration in the hearts of the Swedish people from this podium, which is watched by the eyes of the people all over the world, because in 1940, thanks to the actions taken by the Soviet government, their country was able to avoid the occupation that Hitler's Germany was preparing.

The heroic Soviet people and their glorious army saved Sweden, allowing Sweden to maintain peace and independence throughout the war. This is no accident. The consistent peace policy pursued by the Soviet government proves this.

Hagberg hailed the great socialist architect Comrade Stalin, and the delegates and guests of the Congress responded with a stormy applause.

After Hagberg's speech, the morning session adjourned.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 12th (TASS): The afternoon session of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on the 11th was chaired by Comrade Andrianov. The session continued to discuss Comrade Khrushchev's report on the draft revision of the CPSU (B) Charter. Omsk delegate Lebedev spoke first.

He said that the Party has turned the Soviet land into an invincible socialist fortress. The Soviet people regard the Lenin-Stalin Party as their long-tested leader and teacher. Our people owe all these epoch-making achievements to the Communist Party, to the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, to the Party's wise and far-sighted policies, and to the Party's tireless work.

Lebedev emphasized that the tasks stipulated in Comrade Malenkov's report on the work of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B), give significant responsibility to Party organizations at all levels, tasking them to improve their work and make it perfect, and to strengthen their ties with the masses every day. The draft revision of the Party Charter guides the work of Communist Party members in order to successfully complete these important tasks. The great significance of the revised Party Charter is that it reflects the rich experience that our Party has accumulated since the 18th Congress.

He then said that the Communist Party members of the Omsk region unanimously endorsed the draft revision of the Party Charter.

Leningrad delegate Sakharov said that, like all the Soviet people, the soldiers, non-commissioned officers, warrant officers, and generals of the Soviet Navy greeted the 19th Congress of the great Lenin-Stalin Party with great political enthusiasm.

The victories of socialism and the magnificent prospects of building communism outlined in the Party's instructions on the Five-Year Plan (the Fifth Five-Year Plan) inspire all naval personnel to strive for new achievements in their military and political training.

Sakharov emphasized that Comrade Stalin's instructions have always determined and continue to determine the direction and content of naval scientific thought. All naval personnel, in order to repay Comrade Stalin's paternal care and follow his wise instructions, are tirelessly improving their skills. The ranks of naval officers, naval experts, senior technicians, and outstanding personnel in military and political training who are infinitely loyal to the motherland and the Lenin-Stalin Party are growing and consolidating.

Sakharov continued to point out that the Navy is carrying out large-scale cultural and educational work. Many officers' and sailors' clubs, theaters, libraries, film projection equipment, and radio stations have now been established in the Navy.

Communist Party members in the Navy discussed and unanimously endorsed the draft revision of the Party Charter at their meetings. This Party Charter will raise the organizational and ideological work of our Party to a new and higher level, and will increase its strength and unity.

Delegate Kasnoskat (Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic) said that the draft revision of the Party Charter has been unanimously endorsed by all Party organizations in Lithuania.

Communist Party members have very enthusiastically discussed the documents related to the Congress, especially the draft revision of the Party Charter. In the discussions, they critically analyzed their own activities in order to ensure further improvement in all of the Party's work.

Kasnoskat pointed out that the Lithuanian Communist Party has greatly grown and strengthened since joining the CPSU(B). It has absorbed the best representatives of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals who are loyal to the Party's cause and the cause of communist construction. Thanks to the division of districts and the establishment of regional and district Party committees, the leadership of grassroots Party organizations has improved. These measures have brought the Party's organs closer to Party members and increased the role of grassroots organizations. However, the work of many grassroots organizations has not yet reached the standard, and there is still much to do to ensure that all grassroots organizations do their job well. The revised Party Charter puts forward important tasks to the grassroots organizations that constitute the foundation of the Party. The new Party Charter submitted for consideration by the Congress will further enhance the Party's combat effectiveness and increase the responsibility of every Communist Party member.

For us, there is nothing more glorious than belonging to the great Lenin-Stalin Party and fighting tirelessly within its ranks, under the leadership of Stalin, for the bright future of mankind—communism.

Tskhovrebashvili, a representative of the Georgian Republic, said that the draft instructions on the Five-Year Plan (the Fifth Five-Year Plan) for the development of the Soviet Union and the draft revision of the Party Charter put forward concrete tasks for the communist construction of our country before the Party and the Soviet people.

The great leaders of the working class, Lenin and Stalin, have always attached particular importance to organizational issues at all stages of the development of our Party. The Party's leadership methods and working methods should meet the needs of specific historical circumstances. The Party has always been improving its working methods and methods, enriching its content, and making it perfect, so as to ensure the unwavering implementation of the political and economic tasks it faces.

The revised Party Charter will further enhance the combat capability of Party organs, ensure closer unity, improve the organization of the Party ranks, and increase the enthusiasm of Communist Party members in implementing the Party's policies.

Georgian Communist Party members discussed and fully endorsed the revised Party Charter. Tskhovrebashvili then talked about the suggestions and revisions put forward by Georgian Communist Party members on the draft Party Charter.

Koreyev, a representative from the Tyumen region, said that the Party organization in the Tyumen region actively discussed the documents published by the Central Committee in preparation for the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). Communist Party members unanimously endorsed the huge plans drawn up by the Party for the further rapid development of our country's economy and culture and the draft revision of the Party Charter, and put forward some suggestions.

At Party congresses and meetings, the issue of properly selecting and educating cadres has received special attention from Communist Party members. The provisions in the draft Party Charter—resolutely implementing the Party's instructions on correctly selecting cadres according to their political qualities and professional abilities—have received heartfelt endorsement. Communist Party members have pointed out that Party committees should be bolder in promoting advanced young workers to leadership positions, implement the policy of using both old and new cadres, and pay special attention to promoting and training women cadres. As Comrade Stalin taught us, we must do everything possible to take care of cadres, help them when they need help, encourage them when they have achieved success in their work, and promote them.

Koreyev went on to say that the Party organization in our region will, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Party Congress, improve the work of educating cadres in the spirit of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, in the spirit of loyalty and honesty to the Party and the state, in the spirit of strict compliance with Party discipline and state laws, and in the spirit of fidelity to principles and intolerance of shortcomings.

Moscow delegate Ilyichev spoke next. He said that the activities of our Party have always adhered to an unshakable Marxist principle: new political tasks require new organizational forms in our work and require improvement of the Party's organizational weapons. The draft revision of the Party Charter submitted to the Congress for discussion reflects Comrade Stalin's further development of the theory of Marxist parties. The Party Charter is based on new political tasks and the rich experience accumulated by the Party in organizational work.

Ilyichev then described the work of the Soviet press and publishing industry. As Lenin and Stalin have consistently emphasized, the Soviet press and publishing industry must play a major role in the development of the Party and the state and in promoting the creativity and initiative of the masses. He said that in this regard, our press and publishing industry, especially newspapers, including the central newspapers, is not yet up to standard. From the rostrum of the 19th Congress, we should say that without carrying out serious principled self-criticism and criticism from below, our press and publishing industry cannot fulfill its lofty mission, and its staff cannot fulfill their responsibilities. The press and publishing industry must play a particularly important role in organizing socialist emulation among the masses and conducting communist education for the working people based on Marxism-Leninism.

Delegate Lukyanov (Yaroslavl) said: The 19th Congress is a very important event in the life of our Party and the Soviet Union. This congress points out the path of further development, the path of building communism.

The widespread and unqualified endorsement of the Party's instructions on the new Five-Year Plan and the draft revision of the Party Charter, and the socialist emulation that has unfolded throughout the country in order to welcome the Congress, show the people's determination to continue to advance under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and achieve new victories, turning Comrade Stalin's teachings on the gradual transition from socialism to communism into practice.

Lukyanov then talked about the draft revision of the Party Charter, and he emphasized the particular importance of the following articles in the Party Charter: Party members are obligated to carry out self-criticism and criticism from below, expose shortcomings in their work and ensure that they are eliminated, and report shortcomings in their work to the Party's leadership organs up to the Party Central Committee, regardless of who is involved in the report. This high requirement for Communist Party members will help the Party to successfully solve all future problems.

Lukyanov then suggested that a clause should be specifically added to the Party Charter emphasizing that every Communist Party member has a responsibility to do everything possible to protect socialist property.

The discussion of Khrushchev's report on the draft revision of the Charter of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) ended here.

Comrade Khrushchev did not make a concluding speech.

At the suggestion of Comrade Suslov, the Congress unanimously adopted the following resolution: accept the original text of the revised Party Charter as a basis, and elect a committee to study and propose revisions and supplements to the original text of the revised Party Charter.

After the committee was elected, the chairman of the meeting, Comrade Andrianov, invited Comrade Bilan, a representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Turkey, to speak, and he was warmly welcomed by the delegates.

He said that the Turkish people are using every possible means to express their most sincere feelings for their great neighbor, the Soviet Union. The following slogans can be seen on the walls of houses and on the machines of factories: Stalin is peace! Stalin is national independence! Stalin is liberation! Long live Stalin!

These words won stormy applause in the hall. Bilan went on to say that the Turkish people will never fight their friend, the Soviet Union. They are unwilling to shed blood for the American billionaires and Turkish millionaires.

They are willing to maintain harmonious and friendly relations with the Soviet people, who have always shown respect for Turkey's national independence and national glory.

The attendees listened attentively to the speech of the representative of the Greek people, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Greece, Zachariadis. He paid tribute to the 19th Party Congress, the great and progressive Russian people and other people of the Soviet Union, and Comrade Stalin.

When he said that in all the difficult and arduous days, Comrade Stalin had always been on the side of the Greek people and sympathetic to their struggles, stormy applause rang through the hall.

Zachariadis went on to say that the Greek people have not lost their hope of liberation, and in the struggle against the American and British imperialists and their lackeys, they have not lost their courage and determination. The Greek people are revitalizing their forces to fight against the servants of American imperialism and strive for their freedom, democracy, and peace.

He concluded by saying: May our great Stalin live forever, for the benefit of all the people of the world. All those present responded with stormy applause.

Communist Party members in the Free Territory of Trieste warmly congratulated the Congress. Representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Trieste, Dominiz, said that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a beacon illuminating the struggle of people of all countries for a stable and lasting world peace and for the maintenance of national independence.

He said, we would like to wish the 19th Party Congress—the Congress of peace and communist construction—success.

Danish Communist Party Chairman Larson spoke next, and he was warmly welcomed by the Congress.

He said that the Bolshevik Party is a teacher and shining example for communist parties and workers' parties in all countries, and it is leading Soviet society from socialism to communism. We are greatly honored to be able to attend its historically significant Congress. He continued, the achievements and prosperity of the socialist motherland encourage us people living in countries of the Atlantic Treaty Organization, where the economic situation is becoming increasingly difficult as a result of the expansion of armaments.

Larson concluded by shouting: Long live peace, friendship, and cooperation between the Danish people and the Soviet people! May our great and dear Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin be healthy and live forever, for the benefit of all mankind!

Those present responded with stormy applause. Everyone stood up.

Next, Comrade Radmanesh, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran, spoke.

He said that the Lenin-Stalin peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union is a guarantee of Iran's independence. The Soviet-Iranian Treaty of 1921 was the first equal treaty concluded between Iran and a major power. He said that this treaty is now and will continue to be an important factor in our national independence. We will never allow the American and British imperialists to carry out their crazy plans for Iran, and we will never allow them to turn Iran into their colony and a springboard for attacking the Soviet Union.

The Iranian people will never take up arms against their best and most beloved friend—the Soviet Union. (Stormy applause)

Radmanesh concluded by hailing the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Iran, the Lenin-Stalin Party, and the leader and teacher of the working people of the world, Comrade Stalin. The delegates stood up and thunderous cheers rang out.

The next speaker was Comrade Bakdash, General Secretary of the Syrian and Lebanese Communist Parties. He conveyed the congratulations of the workers, farmers, and all true patriots of Syria and Lebanon to the 19th Congress, as well as to all the Soviet people and the great Stalin.

He said: Comrades! You are the hope of all mankind. Because of you, our people and the people of all countries in the world have steadfast confidence in the inevitable victory of the struggle for independence, democracy, and socialism.

He concluded by shouting: Long live Soviet-Arab friendship! Long live the 19th Congress of the Bolshevik Party, the Congress of peace and communist construction! Long live the genius of mankind, the great friend of the Syrian and Lebanese people, our beloved leader and teacher, the great Comrade Stalin! (Everyone stood up, with stormy applause)

The Congress will continue to meet on October 13.

    苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会第七日
    继续讨论联共党章修正案
    通过决议接受修正了的党章原文作为基础选出委员会研究并提出修正和补充意见
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十二日电：苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会十一日继续开会。上午会议由沙亚赫米托夫主持。会议继续讨论恩·斯·赫鲁晓夫所作的关于苏联共产党（布尔什维克）党章修正草案的报告。佛罗内兹州的克·普·儒可夫首先发言。
    儒可夫说，党章之所以必需修正是因为生活本身要求这样做。修正的目的是进一步加强党的领导作用。
    约有二万共产党员参加了党的会议和区、市、州党代表会议讨论党章修正草案。他们都热烈地赞同这个草案，并提出了意见和建议，对于加强党的团结、巩固党的队伍、增加共产党员在社会主义发展中的先锋作用表现了极大的关怀。
    儒可夫叙述了佛罗内兹州党组织的工作，他又说，尽管德国法西斯侵略者在这一州造成了巨大的损害，现在这一州的工业和农业生产水平还是大大地超过了战前。
    儒可夫最后叙述了佛罗内兹州党组织对于列宁和斯大林伟大事业的无限忠诚和团结。
    萨拉托夫的鲍科夫同志叙述了党在人民中的巨大的、不可动摇的威信。
    广大的劳动人民对党的事业和对他们自己的事业一样具有深切的信心；他们是跟随着党和他们的领袖与导师斯大林同志的。
    鲍科夫说，萨拉托夫党组织的共产党员一致赞同党章修正草案。他们在他们的会议上指出：这个党的文件规定了党的主要任务、共产党员的义务和权利，它浸透了斯大林对于开展布尔什维克的批评与自我批评、对于保持党的牢不可破的团结的关怀。
    鲍科夫引述了共产党员所提出的对于党章修正草案的一些意见和补充。他说，新的党章反映了广大党员群众的思想和愿望，它是为共产主义建设事业服务的。共产主义是我们的明天，世界上没有
    一个力量能够阻止苏维埃人民向共产主义的最后胜利迈进。
    接着发言的是莫斯科代表费多尔·库兹涅佐夫。他说，修正的党章归纳了党自十八次代表大会以来在发展中积累之丰富经验；它发展了并具体化了适应共产主义建设的新任务的党的基本组织原则。
    库兹涅佐夫说，军队里的党组织对于苏联共产党
    （布尔什维克）中央委员会提交第十九次代表大会的文件的广泛讨论，进一步提高了党员的创造性、主动性和积极性，并且帮助揭发和消灭了党的工作中的缺点。
    在讨论草案的时候，军队里的共产党员特别强调指出，修正的党章中关于思想工作和精通马克思—列宁主义的原则的规定，具有巨大的重要意义。发言者促请大家注意斯大林说过的话：如果我们的军队中有足够数目的久经锻炼的干部，我们的军队就是不可战胜的。
    党章修正草案表明党员履行对党的义务的责任增加了。在军队里，这就是意味着每一个共产党员必须有优越的军事和政治修养，必须是一个高度军事纪律的模范。库兹涅佐夫着重指出新党章中规定的极度加强苏联对其敌人的侵略行动的积极防御这一任务的重要性。
    库兹涅佐夫最后向代表大会保证：苏联军队中的政治工作者和党组织一定孜孜不倦地努力严格地遵照新党章来培养共产党员。
    库页岛州的代表切普拉科夫说：由于党、政府和斯大林同志的帮助和关怀，库页岛州的共产党员和全体劳动人民在消除日本侵略者的强盗统治的后果方面，已做了许多工作。在很短的时期内，大小工厂恢复了，以前落后的煤矿、渔场和造纸厂都改建了，并配备了现代机器。城市和各区中心正在扩大和改善。
    切普拉科夫接着说明党章中所作的修正的巨大意义。在执行建设共产主义伟大任务的工作中，我们党的指导和领导作用以及每个共产党员的作用已无限地提高了。新党章大大提高了党的战斗力。
    切普拉科夫说，库页岛的党组织的工作是有缺点的。库页岛州的共产党员将作一切必要的努力，来尽快消灭这些缺点和执行他们所担负的任务。他们将和全体苏联人民一道提高警惕，加强国防并作一切必要的努力，以防止美日侵略者及我国其他敌人干涉正在建设共产主义的苏联人民的和平劳动。
    巴什基尔自治共和国的代表瓦加波夫在发言的开头就谈到党的英明的列宁—斯大林民族政策，由于这个政策，苏联各个民族业已成为先进的社会主义民族。他举出巴什基尔自治共和国做例子，它已经成为苏联发达的工业地区，并有大规模的社会主义农业。
    瓦加波夫在谈到新的修正的党章时着重指出：新党章将进一步加强党组织和每个党员的作用。
    苏联共产党中央委员会提交第十九次代表大会讨论的历史性文件，已在巴什基尔自治共和国党员和全体劳动人民中间引起了新的政治和劳动高潮。巴什基尔边疆区党组织四万多党员参加了党章修正草案的讨论。
    瓦加波夫最后说，巴什基尔边疆区党组织，像我们整个党一样紧密团结，怀着对党中央委员会和斯大林同志的忠诚参加第十九次代表大会。它准备继续执行党和它的敬爱领袖斯大林同志指定的一切任务。
    维利基·鲁基州代表鲁米扬切夫强调指出，党章修正草案反映了共产主义建设的新的更大的任务，和党在这一方面对每一个党员的新的更大的要求。他说，这个文件在党的一切会议上都得到一致的赞同。苏联共产党中央委员会提交第十九次代表大会的文件的讨论，大大加强了党组织的工作。党员根据新党章草案的更高的要求批评了他们的党委员会、党和苏维埃组织的工作人员及负责人员。
    鲁米扬切夫最后向第十九次代表大会保证，在新的历史性任务面前，维利基·鲁基的党组织将更加紧密地团结在列宁、斯大林党中央委员会和伟大的斯大林的周围。
    布利亚蒙古自治共和国代表卡卡罗夫说，第十九次代表大会一致赞同中央委员会的政治路线及其实际工作，从而表达了我们整个英雄的党的意志。
    无限忠诚于布尔什维克党的苏联人民自愿把他们的命运交给党，因为他们知道列宁、斯大林的党除了人民的利益外没有其他的利益，他们知道党正领导着他们克服路上遇到的一切困难，胜利地走向共产主义的伟大目标。
    卡卡罗夫列举了生动的事实，说明这个自治共和国自从成立了苏维埃政府以来所获得的空前的进展。由于坚决实行了列宁—斯大林民族政策，布利亚蒙古人民成立了国家并变成了社会主义民族。卡卡罗夫说，这一切，我们都得感谢共产党，感谢苏维埃政府，感谢伟大的领袖斯大林同志。
    所有的党组织都讨论了党章修正草案，并普遍表示赞同，因为这些修正反映了党所获得的关于党的发展方面的丰富经验。
    乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国代表庇提钦科说，列宁与斯大林的不朽事业已经成为我国全体苏维埃人民的事业，因为劳动群众把共产党看做是他们的党，看做是他们自己的敬爱的党，他们都深切关怀加强这个党。庇提钦科说，乌克兰首都的共产党员和全体劳动人民，都十分热烈地欢迎苏联共产党中央委员会提交第十九次党代表大会的文件。在基辅，有三千多个党的会议讨论了代表大会的文件。共产党员在会上提出了许多建议。庇提钦科根据基辅党组织的工作举出具体的例子，来说明党章中关于候补党员的条文的重要性。
    他说，党章修正草案是一个具有极大历史意义的文件。我们党在我国由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的时期中所面临的新任务，要求制订这样的党章。
    主席沙亚赫米托夫宣布大会收到美国共产党全国委员会的贺电。大会代表报以暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声。全体起立。
    沙亚赫米托夫接着说，美国共产党代表团的团员们所以不能列席大会，是因为“美国民主”不让他们前来参加大会；美国政府拒绝发签证给美国共产党代表团。
    巴托里切夫宣读了贺电全文。贺电宣读时再三为热烈的掌声所打断。
    贺电向苏联共产党第十九次代表大会表示祝贺，指出苏联在击败希特勒主义和保卫国际和平与民主方面所起的巨大作用，并欢呼苏联在国家工业化和社会主义建设方面的卓越成就。
    大多数美国人民愿意和平，并衷心地希望与苏联建立友好合作。美国共产党全国委员会的委员们写道，他们知道，全世界人民能够防止美帝国主义者正在准备的新的世界大战。各国人民将尽一切力量来达到这个伟大的目标。（暴风雨般的、历久不息的掌声。全体起立）
    接着登台的是德国统一社会党主席威廉·皮克。他受到了大会的代表和来宾的暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声的欢迎。威廉·皮克代表德国人民，代表德国统一社会党向大会致热忱的、兄弟般的、战斗的敬礼。他对于苏联共产党中央委员会，特别是约·维·斯大林在建设方面给予德意志民主共和国的伟大援助表示感激。六十万劳动人民今年十月七日在柏林举行的示威——苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克同志率领的苏联政府代表团也观看了这次示威——是德国人民珍视并争取与苏联的友谊的表现，也是德国人民尊敬斯大林同志的表现。
    威廉·皮克继续说，我们的党在争取和平和德国的统一、反对美帝国主义者的战争计划的斗争中，面临着重大的任务。美帝国主义者要把一个军国主义的一般性条约强加在西德身上，并把它拖到侵略性大西洋公约体系里去。美帝国主义妄想把西德变成欧洲的军事基地，并迫使德国人民走上自相残杀的战争的流血道路。
    与此相反，苏联政府则在致西方三国的照会中，指出了和平解决德国问题的具体的和可以接受的方法。
    威廉·皮克说，我们已组织了一个争取德国的互相了解的广泛的人民运动。西德联邦议会主席团曾不得不接见我国人民议会所选出的代表团并听取该代表团必须表示的意见。
    德国人希望在他们自己的统一的国家中过和平的生活，世界上没有任何力量能够不让这七千万人民得到作为一个国家而存在的权利。这段话引起了经久不息的鼓掌。
    我们已把德意志民主共和国建设成为进行为和平、为统一的德国而斗争的基地。
    威廉·皮克最后为伟大的共产主义建筑师约·维·斯大林欢呼。这又引起整个会场的欢呼。全场起立。
    乌拉圭共产党书记阿里斯孟第代表乌拉圭共产党中央委员会向代表大会，向全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖与导师约·维·斯大林致贺。阿里斯孟第受到代表们的热烈欢迎。阿里斯孟第说，美帝国主义者在地主、他们的走狗、大资本家和商人的帮助下，妄想把乌拉圭变成侵略战争的一个基地，变成一个炮灰来源地和他们垄断资本的原料供应地。乌拉圭的无产阶级和全体人民正在大声疾呼地反对这种罪恶活动，他们愈来愈响亮地宣布：他们决不在帝国主义者所正在准备的反苏的侵略战争中充当炮灰。
    阿里斯孟第最后为代表大会，为约·维·斯大林，并为乌拉圭人民和伟大的苏维埃人民的友好欢呼，全场报以暴风雨般的掌声。
    荷兰共产党中央委员会总书记格鲁特向代表大会致贺，代表们予以热烈的欢迎。
    他说，请特别容许我为了你们在空前伟大的名将斯大林同志指挥下所获得的战胜德国法西斯主义和日本军国主义的胜利，向你们表示深切的感谢。
    我们深信，我们不仅能够代表我们的党，而且能够代表被你们从恐怖的希特勒匪帮的奴役下解救出来的大多数荷兰人民，来说这句话。我国人民将永远记得伟大的强有力的苏联为他们所做的一切。
    作为感谢的象征，格鲁特向代表大会主席团献阿姆斯特丹党组织的旗帜一面，上面题着“荷兰人民将永不和苏联作战”。全场起立。暴风雨般的掌声震荡了大厅。
    瑞典共产党主席哈格堡受到了代表们的热烈欢迎。
    他说，在人类历史上，一个人对于这样多的人具有这样重大意义，像斯大林同志那样，是从来没有过的。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我借这个机会在全世界人民的眼光所注视的这个讲台上来表达瑞典人民心中的深深谢意和钦仰，因为在一九四○年，由于苏联政府采取的行动，他们的国家才避免了希特勒德国正在准备的占领。
    英雄的苏联人民、他们光荣的军队拯救了瑞典，使瑞典在整个战争时期能够保持和平与独立。这并不是偶然的。苏联政府一贯奉行的和平政策可以证明这一点。
    哈格堡欢呼伟大的社会主义建筑师斯大林同志，代表大会的代表和来宾报以暴风雨般的掌声。
    在哈格堡发言后，上午会议休会。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十二日电：苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会十一日下午会议由安德里亚诺夫同志担任主席。会上继续讨论赫鲁晓夫同志关于联共（布）党章修正草案的报告。鄂木斯克代表列别捷夫首先发言。
    他说，党已经把苏维埃国土变成了一个不可战胜的社会主义堡垒。苏联人民认为列宁、斯大林党是他们的久经考验的领袖和导师。我们的人民之所以有这一切划时代的成就，应该感谢共产党，感谢列宁—斯大林的领导，感谢党的英明的、有远见的政策，感谢党的不懈的工作。
    列别捷夫强调指出，联共（布）中央委员会书记马林科夫同志关于中央委员会工作的报告中规定的任务，给予各级党组织以重大的责任，责成它们改进工作，使之臻于完善，并每日加强与群众的联系。党章修正草案指导共产党员的工作，以便胜利完成这些重要的任务。修正的党章的重大意义在于它反映了我们的党在第十八次代表大会以来所积累的丰富的经验。
    他接着说，鄂木斯克州的共产党员一致赞同党章修正草案。
    列宁格勒代表萨哈罗夫说，像所有的苏联人民一样，苏联海军的战士、士官、校尉和将军们以极大的政治热情迎接伟大的列宁、斯大林的党的第十九次代表大会。
    党关于苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示所概述的社会主义的胜利和建设共产主义的壮丽前景，鼓舞全体海军人员努力在他们的军事和政治训练中获得新的成绩。
    萨哈罗夫强调指出，斯大林同志的指示过去一向决定了、现在也仍然决定着海军科学思想的方向和内容。全体海军人员为了报答斯大林同志的慈父般的关怀并遵循他的英明指示，正在孜孜不倦地提高自己的技术。对祖国和列宁—斯大林党无限忠诚的海军军官、海军专家、高级技术人员以及军事与政治训练方面的优秀人员的队伍正在壮大着并巩固着。
    萨哈罗夫继即指出：海军正在展开大规模的文教工作。现在在海军中已设立了许多的军官和水兵俱乐部、剧院、图书馆、电影放映设备和广播电台。
    海军中的共产党员在他们的会议上讨论了并一致赞同党章修正草案。这个党章将把我们党的组织与思想工作提高到新的更高的水平，并将增加它的力量与团结。
    代表卡斯诺斯卡特（立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国）说，党章修正草案已经得到立陶宛全体党组织的一致的赞同。
    共产党员十分热烈地讨论了有关代表大会的文件，特别是党章修正草案。他们在讨论中批判地分析了他们自己的活动，以便保证进一步改善党的全部工作。
    卡斯诺斯卡特指出，立陶宛共产党自从加入联共（布）以来，已经大大地壮大和加强了。它吸收了忠于党的事业、忠于共产主义建设事业的工人、集体农民和知识分子中最优秀的代表入党。由于区的划分和州、区党委会的建立，对基层党组织的领导改善了，这些措施使得党的机构与党员更为接近，并提高了基层组织的作用。可是，许多基层组织的工作还没有达到标准，要保证所有基层组织做好工作，还有许多事情要做。修正党章在构成党的基础的基层组织面前提出了重要的任务。提交代表大会考虑的新党章，将进一步提高党的战斗力和增加每个共产党员的责任。
    对于我们来说，再没有任何事情比属于列宁—斯大林伟大的党并在它的队伍内、在斯大林的领导下，不倦地为人类光明的前途——共产主义——而奋斗更光荣了。
    格鲁吉亚共和国代表茨霍夫莱巴什维利说，第十九次党代表大会关于苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示草案以及党章修正草案，在党和苏维埃人民面前提出了我国共产主义建设的具体任务。
    工人阶级的伟大领袖列宁和斯大林，一向特别重视我们党的发展的各阶段的组织问题。党的领导方式和党的工作方法应当符合具体历史情况的需要。党始终在改进它的工作方式和方法，丰富它的内容，使其达到完善的地步，从而保证坚持不渝地执行它面前的政治和经济任务。
    修正的党章将进一步提高党机构的战斗能力，保证更加紧密的团结，改进党的队伍的组织，提高共产党员执行党的政策的积极性。
    格鲁吉亚共产党员讨论了并且完全赞同修正的党章。茨霍夫莱巴什维利接着谈到格鲁吉亚共产党员对党章草案提出的建议和修正。
    第乌门代表哥莱耶契夫说，第乌门州党组织积极地讨论了中央委员会发表的为苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会所准备的文件。共产党员一致赞同党为了进一步迅速发展我国经济和文化而拟订的巨大计划以及党章修正草案，并且提出了一些建议。
    在党的大会和会议上，适当挑选和教育干部的问题，受到共产党员的特别注意。党章草案中的规定——坚决执行党关于按照政治品质和业务能力正确地选拔干部的指示，获得衷心的赞同。共产党员们指出，党委员会应当更大胆地把先进的青年工作人员提拔到领导工作岗位上去，执行关于老干部和新干部一同使用的政策，特别注意提拔与训练妇女干部。像斯大林同志教导我们的那样，必须尽一切可能照顾干部，在他们需要帮助的时候帮助他们，在他们工作有成绩的时候鼓励他们，并且提拔他们。
    哥莱耶契夫接着说，我们州的党组织将遵照党中央委员会和党代表大会的指示，用布尔什维克的批评和自我批评的精神、对党和国家忠诚老实的精神、严格遵守党纪国法的精神、忠于原则和不容忍缺点的精神来改进教育干部的工作。
    莫斯科代表伊里切夫接着发言。他说，我们党的活动一贯遵守着一个不可动摇的马克思主义原则：新的政治任务要求在工作中采取新的组织形式，要求改进党的组织武器。提交代表大会讨论的党章修正草案，反映了斯大林同志进一步发展了的关于马克思主义政党的学说。党章是从新的政治任务，是从党在组织工作方面积累的丰富经验出发的。
    伊里切夫接着叙述了苏联新闻出版事业的工作。正如列宁和斯大林一贯强调指出的，苏联新闻出版事业必须在党和国家的发展中，在促进群众的创造性和进取心方面，起重大作用。他说，在这一方面，我们的新闻出版事业，特别是报纸，包括中央报纸在内，还不够标准。从第十九次代表大会的讲台上，我们应该说，如果不开展认真的原则性的自我批评和自下而上的批评，我们的新闻出版事业就不能完成它的崇高使命，它的工作人员也就不能完成他们的职责。新闻出版事业必须在组织群众的社会主义竞赛和根据马克思—列宁主义对劳动人民进行共产主义教育方面，起特别重大的作用。
    代表鲁基扬诺夫（雅罗斯拉夫尔）说：第十九次代表大会是我们党和苏维埃生活中一件非常重要的事情。这个大会指明了进一步发展的道路，建设共产主义的道路。
    党关于新五年计划的指示和党章修正草案所得到的普遍的毫无保留的赞成，和全国为了迎接大会而展开的社会主义竞赛，显示人民决心在党中央委员会领导下继续前进并且取得新的胜利，把斯大林同志关于从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的教言变成实际。
    鲁基扬诺夫继而谈到党章修正草案，他着重指出党章中下面几条的特殊重要性，这几条规定：党员有义务开展自我批评与自下而上的批评，揭露他们工作中的缺点并保证加以消灭，向党的领导机关直至党的中央委员会报告工作中的缺点，不管报告牵涉到什么人。这种对共产党员的高度要求将有助于党胜利地解决今后的一切问题。
    鲁基扬诺夫于是建议：在党章中应该特别增加关于强调每一个共产党员有责任尽力保护社会主义财产的条文。
    赫鲁晓夫关于苏联共产党（布尔什维克）党章修正草案的报告的讨论至此结束。
    赫鲁晓夫同志没有作总结发言。
    在苏斯洛夫同志建议下，代表大会一致通过以下决议：接受修正了的党章的原文作为基础，选举一个委员会来研究并提出对修正了的党章的原文的修正和补充。
    委员会选出后，会议主席安德里亚诺夫同志请土耳其共产党中央委员会代表毕兰同志致词，他受到代表们的热烈欢迎。
    他说，土耳其人民正利用一切可能的办法来表示他们对伟大的邻邦苏联的最诚挚的感情。在房屋的墙壁上，在工厂的机器上都能看到以下的标语：斯大林就是和平！斯大林就是民族独立！斯大林就是解放！斯大林万岁！
    这些话在大厅里博得了暴风雨般的掌声。毕兰接着说，土耳其人民将永远不对他们的朋友苏联作战。他们不愿意为美国的亿万富翁和土耳其的百万富翁流血。
    对于一向对土耳其的民族独立和民族光荣表示尊重的苏联人民，他们愿意保持和睦的、友好的关系。
    与会者注意地倾听希腊人民的代表、希腊共产党中央委员会总书记萨查利阿第斯的发言。他向第十九次党代表大会，伟大的、进步的俄罗斯人民和苏联的其它人民及斯大林同志致敬。
    当他说到在所有艰难困苦的日子里，斯大林同志一直是站在希腊人民这一边并同情他们的斗争的时候，暴风雨般的掌声响遍全厅。
    萨查利阿第斯接着说，希腊人民并没有失去他们得到解放的希望，在反对美、英帝国主义者和他们的奴才的斗争中，他们没有失去勇气和决心。希腊人民正在重振他们的力量进行斗争，反对美帝国主义的仆从，争取他们的自由、民主与和平。
    他最后说：祝我们的伟大的斯大林万寿无疆，以造福全世界人民。全体与会者这时报以暴风雨般的掌声。
    的里雅斯特自由区的共产党员热诚地祝贺代表大会。的里雅斯特共产党中央委员会代表多米尼兹说，苏联共产党是一座灯塔，照耀着各国人民为争取稳固的持久的世界和平、为维护民族独立而进行的斗争。
    他说，我们谨祝第十九次党代表大会——和平与共产主义建设的代表大会成功。
    丹麦共产党主席拉荪接着致词，他受到大会热烈的欢迎。
    他说，布尔什维克党是各国共产党和工人党的导师和光辉的榜样，它正领导着苏维埃社会从社会主义走向共产主义，我们能列席它的这个具有历史意义的代表大会，是十分荣幸的。他继续说，社会主义祖国的成就和繁荣鼓舞着我们生活在大西洋公约国家的人民，在那里，由于扩张军备的结果，经济处境日益困难。
    拉荪最后高呼：丹麦人民和苏联人民之间的和平、友好与合作万岁！祝我们伟大的亲爱的约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林健康和万寿无疆，以造福全人类！
    与会者报以暴风雨般的掌声。全体起立。
    接着由伊朗人民党中央委员会总书记拉德马涅契同志致词。
    他说，苏联的列宁、斯大林和平外交政策是伊朗独立的保障。一九二一年的苏伊条约是伊朗和一个大国缔结的第一个平等条约。他说，这个条约现在是，将来还是我们民族独立的重要因素之一。我们决不允许美、英帝国主义者执行他们对伊朗的疯狂计划，决不允许他们把伊朗变为他们的殖民地和进攻苏联的跳板。
    伊朗人民决不拿起武器反对他们最好和最敬爱的朋友——苏联。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    拉德马涅契最后为苏联和伊朗两国人民之间的友谊，为列宁、斯大林的党，为全世界劳动人民的领袖和导师斯大林同志欢呼。代表们起立，响起了雷动的欢呼声。
    下一个致词的是叙利亚和黎巴嫩共产党总书记巴克达斯同志。他向第十九次代表大会，以及全体苏联人民和伟大的斯大林转达了叙利亚和黎巴嫩工人、农民和所有真正的爱国者的祝贺。
    他说：同志们！你们是全人类的希望。由于你们，我国人民和全世界各国人民已对争取独立、民主和社会主义的斗争的必定胜利有了坚定的信心。
    他最后高呼：苏联—阿拉伯友好万岁！布尔什维克党第十九次代表大会，和平与共产主义建设的大会万岁！人类的天才、叙利亚和黎巴嫩人民的伟大朋友、我们敬爱的领袖和导师伟大的斯大林同志万岁！（全体起立，暴风雨般的掌声）
    代表大会将在十月十三日继续开会。
