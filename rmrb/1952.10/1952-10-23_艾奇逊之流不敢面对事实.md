    Acheson and his ilk dare not face the facts
    In order to resolutely continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea, the United States suddenly and unilaterally suspended the Panmunjom armistice negotiations on October 8. In their letter to Clark, commander-in-chief of the US invading forces in Korea, Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai exposed and condemned this American conspiracy on October 16, and at the same time put forward solemn demands in line with the peace aspirations of the people of the world. Park Heon-young, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, also sent a telegram to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on October 17, requesting that the letter from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to Clark and the full text of the draft Korean Armistice Agreement be distributed to the delegations of all member states and the members of the United Nations Security Council. , so that they can understand the circumstances of the interruption of the Korean negotiations. This request is obviously very legitimate and necessary. However, United Nations officials under the manipulation of the United States suppressed Foreign Minister Park Heon-young's telegram and attachments, and distorted it by saying that Foreign Minister Park Heon-young only requested that "a summary of the Korean armistice negotiation proposal" and "part of the agreement" be included in the United Nations record.
    This despicable and cowardly behavior of the United States in the United Nations shows that Acheson and his ilk dare not face the facts and dare not present the truth to the people.
    As is well known, in his speech at the current United Nations General Assembly, Acheson not only attempted to shirk the blame for the United States' delay and sabotage of the Korean armistice negotiations, demanding that the United Nations support the United States' violations of the Geneva Convention, but also openly stated that the United States would make the Korean War "permanent." He demanded that its vassal states provide more manpower and material resources to make bloody profits for Wall Street monopoly capitalists. In order to achieve this shameful goal, Acheson displayed his talent for lying, saying that the Korean armistice negotiations failed to reach an agreement because the Korean and Chinese sides had been refusing the "reasonable conditions" of the US side. But as long as people look at the ironclad facts listed in the letter from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to Clark, Acheson's lies will be completely bankrupt. Therefore, Acheson and his ilk are very afraid of making public the letter from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai at the United Nations General Assembly.
    Acheson is particularly afraid that every representative to the United Nations will understand such a prominent fact: that all issues in the Korean negotiations have been agreed upon due to our efforts, and all that remains is the issue of full repatriation of prisoners of war in accordance with the terms of the agreement. If it were not for the US side deliberately obstructing the issue of prisoners of war and insisting on its absurd proposition of "voluntary repatriation" with inhumane methods, the Korean armistice negotiations would have been realized long ago, Korea would have been restored to peace long ago, and prisoners of war on both sides would have returned home long ago to live peaceful lives. It is for this reason that United Nations officials, at the direction of the United States, hypocritically said that Foreign Minister Park Heon-young only sent the United Nations "a summary of the armistice negotiation proposal" and "part of the agreement." The United States is attempting to create an incorrect impression on people in this way, as if the Korean armistice negotiations are still far from reaching an agreement, in order to lure those vassal states, which Acheson scolded as "timid" and "unable to muster the courage," deeper into the sinful quagmire of the war of aggression.
    But in the face of facts and justice, Acheson and his ilk are precisely
    "timid" and "unable to muster the courage." Otherwise, why don't they dare to distribute our letter from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to Clark at the United Nations General Assembly?
    This shameful act of the United States in blocking true news and distorting the truth will not prevent its lies from going bankrupt; on the contrary, it further exposes the conspiracy of the United States to deliberately sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations and use the United Nations General Assembly to expand the war of aggression. Therefore, all peace-loving people will be more vigilant and fight for a Korean armistice and to defend peace.

    艾奇逊之流不敢面对事实
    美国为了决心继续并扩大侵朝战争，于十月八日突然片面地中止了板门店的停战谈判。我方金日成、彭德怀两将军在十月十六日致美国侵朝军总司令克拉克的信中，已经揭穿了和斥责了美国的这一阴谋，同时提出了符合全世界人民和平愿望的严正要求。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永并于十月十七日致电联合国秘书长，要求把金日成、彭德怀两将军致克拉克的信及朝鲜停战协定草案全文，分发给各会员国的代表团及联合国安全理事会的各理事，以便使他们了解朝鲜谈判中断的情况。这一要求显然是十分正当和必要的。但是在美国操纵下的联合国官员却把朴宪永外务相的电报和附件扣压下来，并且歪曲地说朴宪永外务相只要求将“朝鲜停战谈判建议的摘要”和“一部分协议”列入联合国记录。
    美国在联合国中所做的这种卑鄙懦怯的行为，说明艾奇逊之流不敢面对事实，不敢把事实真相在人们面前摆出来。
    如所周知，艾奇逊在这次联合国大会上的演说中，不但企图推卸美国拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的罪责，要求联合国支持美国违背日内瓦公约的行为，并且公然表示美国将使朝鲜战争“持久化”，要求它的仆从国家提供更多的人力物力，去为华尔街垄断资本家牟取血腥利润。为了达到这一可耻目的，艾奇逊发挥了他的说谎本领，说什么朝鲜停战谈判未达成协议，是因为朝中方面一直拒绝美方的“合理条件”。但是只要人们看一看金日成、彭德怀两将军致克拉克的信中所列举的铁的事实，艾奇逊的谎言就会完全破产。因此，艾奇逊之流就十分害怕把金日成、彭德怀将军的信在联合国大会上公开出来。
    艾奇逊特别害怕联合国每一个代表都了解这样一件突出的事实：即朝鲜谈判中的所有问题都已因我方的努力而达成协议，剩下的只是按照协定的条款实行战俘全部遣返的问题。如果不是因为美方故意在战俘问题上横加阻挠，用惨无人道的方法坚持其“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，那末朝鲜停战谈判必然早已实现，朝鲜必然早已恢复和平，双方战俘也必然早已回家过和平生活了。就是因为这个缘故，联合国官员在美国指使下，就假惺惺地说朴宪永外务相只给联合国发来“停战谈判建议的摘要”和“一部分协议”。美国企图这样给人们造成一个不正确的印象，似乎朝鲜停战谈判距离达成协议还很遥远，以便诱使那些被艾奇逊斥骂为“胆小怕事”、“拿不出勇气来”的仆从国家，更深一步地陷入侵略战争的罪恶泥淖中。
    但是在事实和正义的面前，艾奇逊之流正是
    “胆小怕事”和“拿不出勇气来”的。否则为什么他们不敢在联合国大会上分发我方金日成、彭德怀两将军致克拉克的信呢？
    美国这种封锁真实消息，歪曲事实真相的可耻行为，并不能使它的谎言欺骗免于破产；相反地，它更加暴露了美国蓄意破坏朝鲜停战谈判，并利用联合国大会扩大侵略战争的阴谋诡计。因此，一切爱好和平的人民必将更加提高警惕，为争取朝鲜停战和保卫和平而斗争。
