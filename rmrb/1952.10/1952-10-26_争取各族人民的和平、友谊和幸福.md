    Striving for Peace, Friendship, and Happiness for All Ethnic Groups
    Kozhevnikov, Soviet Representative to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    On this festive day, the capital of the People's Republic of China, Beijing, is solemn and beautiful.
    In these days, every Soviet person's heart is filled with joyful and internationalist pride due to the great construction achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong.
    The achievements of the Chinese people are a great contribution to the cause of peace. The achievements of the People's Government in building a new China are a reliable pillar and inspiring example for all nations in the Asian and Pacific regions in their struggle for peace and national independence.
    There is no need to list the tremendous achievements of the Chinese people in such a short period, these achievements are well known to the working people of the world, especially to the Soviet people, because the fraternal unity and friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people are unbreakable.
    A new consciousness and a new social system have been firmly established among the Chinese people, which is the result of the Chinese Communist Party's outstanding and unremitting educational work. The Chinese people have a love for the Chinese Communist Party like a son for his mother, and they clearly realize that it is due to the heroic actions of the Chinese Communist Party that the Chinese people have been freed from feudal and imperialist enslavement and have embarked on the bright road to universal happiness and prosperity.
    The great liberated creative power of the Chinese people is used for great purposes. This power has generated labor heroism in the broadest masses, making it a powerful driving force for new people.
    These excellent characteristics bring the Soviet and Chinese peoples closer and promote a spiritual, brotherly understanding, a profound friendship, and unlimited respect between the two peoples. The Chinese people are using water conservancy projects to control China's largest rivers, turning vast lands that were once deserts due to flooding into fertile fields. This great work is felt, excited, and understood by no other people as much as by the Soviet people, because the Soviet people are engaged in great communist construction, grand projects to transform nature, and magnificent water conservancy structures built with the efforts of the entire people.
    Soviet communist construction is not only completing great construction tasks, but also cultivating new technical intellectual cadres from the ranks of the working class who have mastered the most advanced and high-level technologies. I believe that China's great construction is also such a school for technical cadres.
    Before setting off for Beijing, I visited the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station—one of the great communist construction projects. At that time, the builders of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, who had completed their work tasks, had already transferred there.
    Here I would like to talk about how the collective farmers of Kuibyshev Oblast are now preparing to use the equipment of the great water conservancy construction to further improve the effectiveness of agriculture.
    The Soviet government has put forward tasks for the collective farmers and created conditions for the chairmen of our collective farms to receive higher agricultural technical education in recent years.
    At the same time, a comprehensive system of electrical mechanization will be established in the agricultural work of the states surrounding the communist construction project. In collective farms, many electrician-mechanic training classes have been opened. At experimental farms, thousands of collective farm mechanics are studying the characteristics of new electric agricultural machines.
    New, high-yielding crops that have never been planted here before will be planted on millions of hectares of land that will be covered with perfect irrigation systems.
    The Soviet Academy of Sciences has formulated scientific principles, the application of which will enable new crops in new regions to achieve the highest yields. Thousands of agronomists are teaching farmers in experimental areas new agricultural methods.
    New, unprecedented yields and a new height of agricultural productivity further increase the affluent life of collective farms and the budgets of collective farms. The management of collective farms is formulating five-year plans to develop their own collective farms, so as to further use new high incomes for the basic construction and cultural construction of collective farms. In our country, the close connection between peasant labor and worker labor, and the close connection between rural culture and urban culture are being realized in this way. In this way, by adopting the most modern, powerful, and comprehensive technologies and the achievements of agricultural science, Soviet collective farmers have forever freed themselves from heavy labor, while using their liberated energy to further master all aspects of Soviet culture and to serve well the cultivation of millions of educated, advanced, and highly conscious people of Soviet society, who are able to gloriously realize the great plans for the construction and development of the Soviet Union planned by Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the working people of the world.
    The powerful electric torrents of the great communist construction projects have put forward new tasks for Soviet science and technology: to manufacture new machines—combined machines and machine tools—unprecedented in world technology and fundamentally different from those currently manufactured.
    Not long ago, at the invitation of the State Committee, I visited a new automated factory that can manufacture automobile parts without any manual contact; the entire factory only has fourteen people. The work of the factory is silent. The finished products, packaged by machines, are automatically loaded onto trucks. This factory made me feel like a mythical miracle. I had a feeling of being immersed in the distant future. But the State Committee did not approve this factory. The committee suggested that the designers reduce the staff of the factory to four people through further automation. Later, they told me that such automated factories would be very common. The increase in the number of factories with four workers will be a very considerable figure in terms of saving technical cadres, as the shortage of technical cadres is increasing due to our great construction.
    After talking about these, is it still necessary to talk about how drastically the nature of Soviet workers' labor is changing, and at the same time, what good conditions are being established for the comprehensive and harmonious development of people whose physical labor has been liberated by modern automated machines?
    The cheapest electricity and abundant resources are the source of further lowering the prices of all industrial products and raising the real wages of Soviet working people. Due to all this, the lives of the Soviet people will become happier.
    The instructions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union unfolded before the people of the world the Soviet people's great post-war five-year construction plan, the purpose of which is to realize further peaceful construction.
    This great plan inspires every Soviet person, opens up new and infinitely broad prospects for creative labor, and raises people's awareness with patriotic pride and the determination to contribute all their strength to great peaceful construction.
    In these days, the Soviet people turn their filial gaze to the great leader and mentor, the genius creator of the people's happiness, and the great standard-bearer of world peace, Comrade Stalin, with love and gratitude. The Soviet people are happy for the success of the Chinese people in these days of the third anniversary of their great victory, and believe that the Chinese people, under the leadership of their great leader Mao Zedong, will be able to realize in a very short period of time the great plan for further comprehensive construction for the happiness and prosperity of all the heroic Chinese people.
    The Soviet representatives who came to Beijing to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference have personally seen how strong and consistent the Chinese people's desire for peace is, how the Chinese people are diligently realizing great construction tasks in their own country, and how they are turning it into a reliable pillar of the cause of peace.
    The common great struggle for peace brings the Soviet and Chinese peoples closer and strengthens the unbreakable friendship between us. This common struggle is an unshakable foundation for consolidating world peace, and inspires the people of the world to participate in the heroic struggle for peace, giving them a strong belief that the forces of peace will defeat the dark forces of war.

    争取各族人民的和平、友谊和幸福
    出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议苏联代表　科热夫尼科夫
    在这个节日里，中华人民共和国的首都北京是庄严而美丽的。
    这些天来，每个苏联人的心中，由于中国人民在中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导下获得了伟大的建设成就，都充溢着愉快的和国际主义的自豪感情。
    中国人民的成就是对于和平事业的巨大贡献。人民政府在建设新中国方面的成就，是亚洲和太平洋区域各民族在争取和平与民族独立斗争中的可靠支柱，是令人鼓舞的范例。
    不必列举中国人民在极短期间内所获得的巨大成就，这些成就已被全世界劳动人民所熟知了，特别是苏联人民知道得更清楚，因为苏联人民和中国人民的兄弟般的团结和友谊是永不可破的。
    新的意识，新的社会制度，已在中国人民中巩固地确立了起来，这是中国共产党所进行的卓越的、不懈的教育工作的结果。中国人民对中国共产党怀着儿子对母亲一般的热爱，他们都清楚地认识到，由于中国共产党的英勇行为，中国人民才摆脱了封建的和帝国主义的奴役，走上了普遍幸福和繁荣的光明大道。
    中国人民伟大的解放了的创造力量，是用于伟大的目的的。这种力量在最广大的群众中产生了劳动的英雄主义，使它成为新的人物的强有力的动力。
    这些优良的特点使苏联人民和中国人民日益接近，并促使两国人民有着精神上亲如兄弟的互相谅解，有着最深刻的友谊和无限的尊敬。中国人民用水利工程来控制中国最巨大的河流，使从前因被水冲淹而变成荒漠的广大土地从此成为肥田。这种伟大的工作，对于任何其他人民来说，都不能像苏联人民那样感到亲切、兴奋和了解，因为苏联人民正在进行伟大的共产主义建设、宏伟的改造自然工程，和以全体人民的努力来建造的雄伟的水利建筑。
    苏联的共产主义建设，不仅在完成着伟大的建设任务，而且也从掌握最先进的高级技术的工人阶级队伍中培养出新的技术知识分子干部来。我认为，中国的伟大建设也同样是这种技术干部学校。
    我启程赴北京以前，曾到过古比雪夫水电站——伟大的共产主义建设工程之一。那时候，完成了工作任务的列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的建造者们，已经转到了那里。
    这里我想谈一谈古比雪夫州集体农民现在为了进
    一步提高农业的效力，如何准备使用伟大的水利建筑设备的情形。
    苏联政府给集体农民提出了任务，并为我国各集体农庄主席在最近几年内能受到高等农业技术教育创造了条件。
    同时，在共产主义建设工程周围各州的农业工作，将要建立起全面的电气机械化的制度。在集体农庄，已开办了许多电力机械师训练班。在实验农场，数以千计的集体农庄的机械师正在研究新电力农业机器的特性。
    在将要布满完善灌溉系统的数百万公顷的田地上，将要种植起过去这里从未种植过的新的、高额收获的作物。
    苏联科学院制订了科学的原则，这些原则的应用，将使新地区的新作物达到最高的收获量。成千
    的农学家们用新的农业方法来教导实验地区的农民。
    新的空前的收获量和农业的新的高度生产效能，使集体农庄的富裕生活和集体农庄的预算更加提高。集体农庄的管理处制订发展自己集体农庄的五年计划，以便把新的高度的收入进一步用于集体农庄的基本建筑和文化建设。在我国，就这样实现着农民劳动与工人劳动的接近，农村文化与城市文化的接近。这样，苏联集体农民借着采用最现代化的、强有力的综合技术和农业科学的成就，永远摆脱了繁重的劳动，同时把他们的解放了的精力用来进一步掌握苏联文化的各方面，用来良好地服务于培养数以百万计的有教养的、先进的、高度自觉的苏维埃社会的人，这些人是能够光荣地实现为全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖斯大林所策划的建设和发展苏联的新的伟大计划的。
    伟大共产主义建设工程的强有力的电力巨流，给苏联的科学和技术提出了新的任务：制造新的、世界技术中空前的，而且根本上异于现在所制造的机器——联合机和工作母机。
    不久以前，我曾应国家委员会的邀请参观过一个新的自动工厂，这个工厂用不着手的任何接触就能制造汽车零件，整个工厂只有十四个人。工厂的工作是无声无息的。被机器包装好的现成物品，自动地装上卡车。这个工厂使我感到了一种神话似的奇迹。我有一种好像沉溺在辽远的将来中的感觉。但是国家委员会没有认可这个工厂。委员会建议设计家们以进一步自动化的方法把工厂的工作人员缩减到四个人。后来，他们告诉我说，这样的自动工厂将很普遍。四个工人的工厂数量的增加，在节省技术干部方面将是一个非常可观的数字，由于我国的伟大建设，技术干部缺乏的情况是在增加着的。
    在谈了这些以后，关于苏联工人劳动性质在怎样剧烈地改变着，同时为现代自动机器解放了的体力劳动的人们的全面的、协和的发展建立着怎样良好的条件，还需要再谈吗。
    最廉价的电力，和丰富的资源，就是进一步降低一切工业品价格，和提高苏联劳动人民的实际工资的泉源。由于这一切，苏联人民的生活将更加幸福起来。
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的指示，在全世界人民面前展开了苏联人民战后伟大的五年建设计划，这个计划的目的是为了实现进一步的和平建设。
    这个伟大的计划鼓舞着每个苏联人，为创造性的劳动开辟了新的无限远景，用爱国主义的自豪和把自己的所有力量贡献给伟大和平建设的决心，提高了人们的觉悟。
    苏联人民在这些日子里怀着热爱和感谢把自己的儿子的视线转向伟大的领袖和导师、人民幸福的天才创造者、全世界和平的伟大旗手斯大林同志。苏联人在中国人民伟大胜利第三周年的这些日子里为它的成功而愉快，并相信：中国人民在自己的伟大领袖毛泽东领导下，在极短期间内将能实现为了全体英勇的中国人民的幸福和繁荣的进一步全面建设的巨大计划。
    到北京出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的苏联代表们亲眼看见了，中国人民对和平事业的渴望是如何强烈和一致，中国人民如何在自己国家里辛勤地实现了伟大的建设任务，如何把它变成和平事业的可靠支柱。
    为争取和平而进行的共同的伟大斗争，使苏联人民和中国人民愈益亲近，使我们之间的牢不可破的友谊愈益巩固，这种共同斗争是巩固全世界和平的不可动摇的基础，并鼓舞全世界人民参加争取和平的英勇斗争，使他们的心中产生和平力量战胜战争黑暗势力的坚强信念。
