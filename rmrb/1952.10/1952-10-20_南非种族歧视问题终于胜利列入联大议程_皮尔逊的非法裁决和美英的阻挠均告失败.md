Xinhua News Agency, New York, 19th: According to TASS, the United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the morning of October 17 to discuss whether to include the issue of racial discrimination practiced by the Government of the Union of South Africa in South Africa on the agenda of the General Assembly.

    First to speak was the representative of the Union of South Africa, Jooste, who demanded that the issue of racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa not be included in the agenda. He insisted that the racial discrimination policy of the Union of South Africa was a matter to be decided internally and that the United Nations had no right to interfere.

    British representative Jebb and Australian representative Casey supported the claims of the representative of the Union of South Africa; Indian representative Mrs. Pandit, Chilean representative Santa Cruz, and Iraqi representative Jamali all emphatically pointed out that the racial discrimination policy of the Union of South Africa had had an impact worldwide and that the United Nations General Assembly had the right to intervene in this matter.

    Assembly President Pearson suggested that the Assembly vote on the point of whether the Assembly has the right to consider this issue. Chilean representative Santa Cruz and Mexican representative Nervo criticized Pearson's opinion, saying that this procedure was contrary to precedent and that the issue for the Assembly to decide was whether to include the issue of racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa on the agenda, not whether the Assembly has the right to deal with this issue.

    Soviet representative Vyshinsky said that the President of the Assembly was attempting to usurp the rights of the Assembly for the second time. He said that this action was not a good omen for future events. Vyshinsky pointed out that the President of the Assembly was trying to give a new interpretation to the rules of procedure, and said that this action of the President of the Assembly was contrary to precedent, legally absurd, and an insult to the representatives. Vyshinsky said that he fully agreed with the accusations made by Mexican representative Nervo against the ruling of the President of the Assembly, and said that Nervo's opinion was in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the rules of procedure of the Assembly. Vyshinsky demanded that the Assembly declare the ruling of the President of the Assembly invalid.

    The Assembly then voted on Pearson's ruling and rejected his ruling by an absolute majority. Forty-three countries voted against Pearson's ruling, including the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian Republic, the Byelorussian Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, all Arab and Asian countries, almost all Latin American countries, and many other countries. Only the delegations of ten countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, voted in favor of the President of the Assembly's ruling. Seven delegations abstained.

    After the vote, Iraqi representative Al-Khalidy strongly criticized the President of the Assembly and asked him what he thought about the fact that an absolute majority of delegations had voted against his ruling.

    The Iraqi representative warned the President of the Assembly that he should not use his authority and warned him that one person alone could not determine the powers of the Assembly and that the issue must be discussed after a decision had been made. The Assembly then voted on the proposal to include the issue of racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa on the agenda. Forty-six delegations voted in favor of the proposal; six delegations voted against the proposal; and eight abstained. Only Australia, Colombia, France, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and Britain voted against.

    The morning session then adjourned.

    南非种族歧视问题终于胜利列入联大议程
    皮尔逊的非法裁决和美英的阻挠均告失败
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯，联合国大会于十月十七日上午举行全体会议，讨论是否将关于南非联邦政府在南非所施行的种族歧视的问题列入大会议程。
    首先发言的是南非联邦代表约斯特，他要求不把关于南非联邦的种族歧视问题列入议程。他硬说南非联邦的种族歧视政策是一种应由内部决定的事务，联合国无权过问。
    英国代表杰伯和澳大利亚代表卡希支持南非联邦代表的主张；印度代表潘迪特夫人、智利代表圣克鲁兹和伊拉克代表贾马利都着重地指出：南非联邦的种族歧视政策已在全世界发生了影响，联合国大会是有权过问这个问题的。
    大会主席皮尔逊建议大会就大会是否有权审议这个问题一点，进行表决。智利代表圣克鲁兹和墨西哥代表纳孚指责皮尔逊的意见，并说：这种程序是违反先例的，大会应予决定的问题是：是否将关于南非联邦的种族歧视的问题列入议程，而不是大会是否有权处理这个问题。
    苏联代表维辛斯基说：大会主席已经是第二次试图僭夺大会的权利了。他说：这种行动对于将来的事情，不是一个良好的预兆。维辛斯基指出：大会主席试图对议事规则加以新的解释，并说：大会主席这种行动是违反先例的，在法律上是很荒谬的，而且是对于代表们的侮辱。维辛斯基说，他完全同意墨西哥代表纳孚对于大会主席的裁决提出的指责，并说：纳孚的意见是符合联合国宪章和大会议事规则的。维辛斯基要求大会宣布大会主席的裁决无效。
    大会随即就皮尔逊的裁决进行了表决，并以绝对大多数否决了他的裁决。投票反对皮尔逊裁决的，有四十三个国家，其中包括苏联、乌克兰共和国、白俄罗斯共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、所有阿拉伯国家和亚洲国家、几乎所有的拉丁美洲国家以及其他许多国家。投票支持大会主席的裁决的，只有美、英、法等十个国家的代表团。七个代表团弃权。
    表决以后，伊拉克代表哈利第激烈地指责大会主席，并问他对于绝对大多数代表团投票否决他的裁决一事有什么感想。
    伊拉克代表告诫大会主席说，他不可利用自己的职权，并警告他说：单独一个人是不能决定大会的权限的，问题必须经过决定才可以讨论。随后大会对于主张将南非联邦的种族歧视问题列入议程的提案，进行表决。投票支持这个提案的有四十六个代表团；投票反对这个提案的有六个代表团；八票弃权。投反对票的只有澳大利亚、哥伦比亚、法国、新西兰、南非联邦和英国。
    上午会议至此结束。
