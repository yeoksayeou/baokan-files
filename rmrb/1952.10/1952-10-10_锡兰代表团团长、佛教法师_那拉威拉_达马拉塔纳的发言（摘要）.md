    Speech by N.Dharmaratana, Head of the Ceylon Delegation, Buddhist Monk (Summary)
    Before beginning my speech, I would like to happily announce, on behalf of our peace delegation, the greatest delight at the successful signing of a trade agreement between the governments of China and Ceylon.
    Many of you have probably already read in the Chinese newspapers the welcome news of the signing of a trade agreement between our two countries. According to the agreement, China will give us 80,000 tons of rice to alleviate our rice supply shortage, and on the other hand, the Ceylon government will give the Chinese government every facility to purchase rubber in Ceylon.
    This is indeed exciting news. We are confident that if other Asian countries follow this example – and undoubtedly they will – it will bring stability and peace to our region and the world.
    We in Ceylon have a proud tradition, that in the entire 2,300 years since our founding, we have never participated in any war of aggression against other nations. However, this has not spared our country from the wars of colonial oppression, and the suffering of being trampled underfoot by foreign oppressors for a long time. Even now, despite the fact that the vast majority of our people desire peace, Britain is using our sea and air bases to wage war. Our ports are being used arbitrarily by the United States, Britain, and France for military transport, to advance their military activities in Southeast Asia.
    Ceylon's monazite sand, after processing, is exported to the United States and Britain for the manufacture of atomic weapons. We are being dragged into a war against our Asian neighbors, with whom we were originally at peace. The danger of these wars spreading to Ceylon is very real.
    Ceylon unfortunately has a reputation for occupying an important strategic position in the Indian Ocean. Therefore, imperialists naturally want to use it as a base for aggression, and as a result, we have suffered colonial oppression for more than 400 years. Today, we are again facing the danger of being turned into another "unsinkable aircraft carrier" to serve the aggressive plans of the US-British bloc.
    According to reports, one of the secret decisions passed at the recent Honolulu Conference was to use Ceylon as the logistics headquarters for the United States in the Southeast Asia region. It must be pointed out that this decision was passed at a conference in which neither the Ceylon government nor the Ceylon people were represented.
    Therefore, the peace movement in Ceylon naturally focuses on the issue of using our bases to carry out wars of aggression. We have put forward the following demands as our central slogan:
    (1) Abolish the so-called "Defense Agreement" that leases Ceylon's bases to Britain;
    (2) Ceylon's bases must not be used to commit aggression against any country;
    (3) The Ceylon government must not participate in any country's war plans against any other country.
    However, our concern is not only to prevent our country from being used as a war base, thereby ensuring our own security, but also to prevent the current trend that would cause another world war.
    Our people have already felt the consequences of preparedness and the arms race. Currently, most of our trade has close ties with countries like the United States and Britain, which are increasingly turning to arms production, and this has had a very serious impact on our living standards and the prospects for economic development.
    As they increase arms production, the prices of goods they sell to us continue to rise, while in comparison, the prices they pay for the goods they buy from us continue to fall. Because of the "Cold War," we are forbidden from developing trade relations with countries like the Soviet Union and China, which are willing to buy our goods and sell us what we need.
    A related issue is the export of Ceylon rubber. Rubber is one of our three main exports. In the past, most of our rubber was sold to the United States and Britain. Recently, the United States has used its monopoly position as the main customer for our rubber to drive down rubber prices, and refuses to buy our rubber unless it is at a very low price. At the same time, the United States is putting pressure on the Ceylon government to prevent us from selling rubber to the Soviet Union, New China, or the Eastern European People's Democracies. The United States threatens to stop American aid if Ceylon trades with the non-capitalist world.
    This has brought very serious consequences to our economy. The prices of our exported goods have fallen sharply. Fortunately, the pressure from the masses opened a gap in the American forced embargo. It was because of the people's demands that the government was forced to lift the restrictions on selling rubber to New China. Thus, last year, China became our largest customer for rubber, thereby helping us avoid the complete collapse of rubber prices.
    We are also pleased that the pressure from the people has prompted the Ceylon government to send a trade delegation led by a minister to sign a trade agreement with New China. We are very happy, and we are sure that from now on we will see the beginning of a new chapter in friendly trade and political relations between Ceylon and China.
    I think it is very meaningful that the Ceylon trade delegation and the peace delegation came to China at the same time. There is a close link between trade and peace. Two-thirds of our food supply depends on imports. And most of that has to be imported from Asian countries. If war breaks out, the disruption of shipping and the economic disruption of grain-producing countries will mean starvation for the people of Ceylon. Therefore, peace in Asia equals the uninterrupted supply of our food. Peace in Asia also means the development of mutually beneficial trade with all countries. So, to get our daily food, we must maintain peace in Asia.
    Therefore, peace will not only save us from the horrors of war, but peace is equal to the development of trade. Peace enables us to raise our living standards. Peace enables our country to develop.
    In our own hemisphere, what is contributing to the worsening international situation is the Korean War, the rearmament and militarization of Japan by the United States, and the oppressive colonial wars being waged in colonial countries such as Malaya and Vietnam.
    We believe that the first step to ease the tense war situation in Asia is to immediately stop the Korean War, and to resolve the Korean problem on the basis of withdrawing all foreign troops in Korea and giving the Korean people the freedom to decide their own internal affairs. Our people were horrified to hear reports of the U.S. government's use of bacteriological weapons in Korea. We not only demand the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons, but also demand the trial and punishment of those governments and people who conduct inhumane bacteriological warfare.
    A rearmed and militarized Japan will be a permanent threat to peace in Asia, as past painful experiences have taught us. As long as American imperialism is allowed to rearm Japan and militarize it, Asia will never have peace. Peace can never be achieved without the consent of Japan's neighbors, such as the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, Burma, and India, to a separate peace treaty with Japan. We firmly believe that this conference must oppose the U.S. government's rearmament and militarization of Japan, and must demand negotiations to conclude a peace treaty with Japan that is acceptable to all concerned countries. We must also insist that after such a peace treaty has been concluded, all foreign occupying forces must withdraw from Japan, while guaranteeing the Japanese people a democratic and peaceful life.
    We firmly oppose imperialist countries interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. We especially oppose the direct military intervention by the United States, France, and Britain in countries such as Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, as well as the increasingly large-scale indirect intervention by the United States in the affairs of Ceylon, India, and other Asian countries. We demand an immediate end to the wars in Malaya and Vietnam, the withdrawal of foreign troops from these countries, and the freedom for the people of these countries to manage their own affairs.
    Before I conclude my speech, I would like to thank our Chinese comrades on behalf of the entire Ceylon delegation, not only for doing such a good job in preparing for the conference, but also for the exceedingly good hospitality they have given us. Because of the victory of the Chinese anti-imperialist revolution, China has been liberated and has re-emerged as a world power, which is one of the greatest factors in consolidating peace in Asia. We cheer for the People's Republic of China and the unity of the Chinese nationalities. The people of Asian countries who are still fighting for freedom are watching with admiration and gratitude as the great Chinese people set an example for them.

### 锡兰代表团团长、佛教法师  那拉威拉·达马拉塔纳的发言（摘要）

    锡兰代表团团长、佛教法师
    那拉威拉·达马拉塔纳的发言（摘要）
    在开始我的发言以前，我要愉快地宣布：我以我们和平代表团的名义，对于中国和锡兰的政府圆满地签订贸易协定一事，表示最大的高兴。
    你们大家恐怕不少人已经从中国报纸上读到我们两国政府签订贸易协定的可喜的消息，根据协定，中国将给我们八万吨大米来消除我们大米供应的不足，另一方面锡兰政府将给中国政府以在锡兰购买橡胶的一切便利。
    这确是令人兴奋的消息。我们确信：假如其他亚洲国家都跟随这个榜样——毫无疑问，他们是会这样的——那将使我们区域和世界得到安定与和平。
    我们锡兰有一个足以自豪的传统，那就是在我们建国以来的整个两千三百年中我们从没有参与过任何侵略其他民族的战争。但是，这并没有使我国免受殖民压迫的战争，和长期被外国压迫者踩在脚下的痛苦。就在眼前，尽管我们绝大多数人民希望和平，英国正利用我们的海、空军基地来进行战争。我们的港口被美国、英国和法国任意使用，进行军事运输，来推进它们在东南亚的军事活动。
    锡兰的单晶矿砂，经过加工，就被输出到美国和英国，供制造原子武器之用。我们正被拖进反对亚洲邻国的战争，而这些国家本来是和我们相安无事的。这些战争蔓延到锡兰的危险是的确存在的。
    锡兰不幸有着在印度洋中占重要战略地位的名气。因此，帝国主义者为了侵略的目的，自然就想把它当作一个基地，结果我们在过去四百多年中便受尽了殖民地的压迫。今天，我们又面临着被变为另一条“不沉的航空母舰”为美英集团国家的侵略计划服务的危险。
    根据报道，最近檀香山会议上所通过的秘密决定之一，就是要把锡兰用作美国在东南亚区的后勤总部。必须指出：这一决定是在一个锡兰政府和锡兰人民都没有派代表参加的会议上通过的。
    因此，锡兰的和平运动就自然把重点放在使用我们的基地来进行侵略战争的这个问题上。我们已经提出下列要求，作为我们的中心口号：
    （一）取消把锡兰的基地租给英国的所谓“防御协定”；
    （二）不得利用锡兰的基地对任何国家进行侵略；
    （三）锡兰政府不得参加任何国家针对任何其他国家的战争计划。
    但是，我们所关怀的不仅在于防止我们的国家被用作一个战争基地，从而确保我们自己的安全；而且在于防止会引起另一次世界大战的目前的趋势。
    我们的人民已经感受到备战与军备竞赛的后果了。目前，我们的大部分贸易和美国与英国这些国家有着密切的关系，这些国家越来越转向军备生产，已经给我们的生活水平与经济发展的前途，一个十分严重的影响。
    由于它们增加军备生产，它们卖给我们货物的价格不断上涨，而在两者相比之下，它们购买我们货物所付的价格却不断下降。因为“冷战”的关系，我们被禁止与苏联和中国这样的国家发展贸易关系，这些国家却是愿意买我们的货物和卖给我们所需要的东西的。
    一个有关的问题就是锡兰橡胶的出口的问题。橡胶是我们三项主要出口货之一。在过去，我们大部分的橡胶是卖给美国和英国的。最近，美国利用它是我们橡胶主要主顾这个垄断地位，压低橡胶价格，并且除非在一个很低的价格上，否则就拒绝收买我们的橡胶。同时，美国对锡兰的政府施以压力，不让我们把橡胶卖给苏联、新中国或东欧人民民主国家。如果锡兰与非资本主义世界通商，美国就用停止美援来威胁。
    这给我们的经济带来了十分严重的结果。我国出口商品的价格急遽跌落。幸亏是群众的压力，给美国的强迫禁运打开了一个缺口。正是由于人民的要求，政府才被迫取消了对出卖橡胶给新中国的阻碍。这样，在去年，中国便成为我们橡胶的最大主顾，从而帮助我们避免了橡胶价格的全部崩溃。
    另外我们感到高兴的是，人民的压力已经促使锡兰政府派遣了一个由一位部长领导的贸易代表团与新中国签订一项贸易协定。我们感到很高兴，我们肯定从此将看到锡兰与中国间的友好贸易与政治关系的新的一章的开始。
    我认为，锡兰的贸易代表团与和平代表团同时来到中国是非常有意义的。贸易与和平之间有着密切的联系。我们的粮食供给有三分之二需要依靠进口来维持。而其中的大部分是要从亚洲各国输入的。如果发生战争的话，航运的断绝和产粮国家的经济失常，就将意味着锡兰人民的饥饿。因此，亚洲的和平就等于我们的粮食供应不致中断。亚洲的和平还意味着与各国互惠贸易的发展。所以要取得我们每日的粮食，就必须维护亚洲和平。
    因此，和平不但会把我们从战争的恐怖里拯救出来，而且和平就等于贸易的发展。和平使我们得以提高生活水平。和平能使我们的国家得以发展。
    在我们自己的这个半球上，促成国际局势日益恶化的事情就是朝鲜战争，美国重新武装日本和使日本军国主义化，以及正在马来亚和越南等殖民地国家进行的压迫殖民地的战争。
    我们认为缓和亚洲紧张的战争局势的第一个步骤就是马上停止朝鲜战争，以及在撤退一切在朝鲜的外国军队并给朝鲜人民决定自己内政的自由的基础上解决朝鲜问题。我们的人民听到了关于美国政府在朝鲜使用细菌武器的报道，感到非常惊骇。我们不但要求禁止使用细菌武器，而且还要求审判和惩办那些进行惨无人道的细菌战的政府和人们。
    一个重新武装起来的、军国主义化的日本对于亚洲的和平将是一个永久的威胁，这一点，过去的惨痛经验已经告诉了我们。只要容许美帝国主义重新武装日本，使日本军国主义化，亚洲就永久不能有和平。如果没有日本的邻国，如中华人民共和国、苏联、缅甸、印度等国的同意，而单独和日本签订和约，和平也是永远得不到的。我们坚信，这次会议一定要反对美国政府重新武装日本和使日本军国主义化，一定要要求进行谈判，来缔结一个能为一切有关国家所接受的对日和约。我们还必须坚持，在缔结了这样的和约以后，一切外国占领军队必须撤出日本，同时还要保证日本人民的民主的和平的生活。
    我们坚决反对帝国主义国家干涉其他国家的内政。我们尤其反对美国、法国和英国在朝鲜、越南和马来亚等国所进行的直接的军事干涉，以及美国对于锡兰和印度与其他亚洲国家的事务所进行的规模越来越大的间接干涉。我们要求立即停止马来亚和越南的战争，撤退这些国家的外国军队，给予这些国家的人民以管理他们自己事务的自由。
    在我结束我的发言以前，我要代表整个锡兰代表团感谢我们的中国同志们，不但要感谢他们对于会议的筹备工作做得那样好，而且更要感谢他们给予我们的过好的招待。由于中国反对帝国主义的革命的胜利，中国得到了解放并且重新成为一个世界强国，这是巩固亚洲和平的最大因素之一。我们为中华人民共和国和中国各民族的团结欢呼。仍然在为着自由而斗争的亚洲各国人民都在用羡慕和感激的目光注视着伟大的中国人民为他们树立榜样。
