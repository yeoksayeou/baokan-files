The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a conference on industrial production and capital construction from October 5th to 7th. Responsible cadres from the Party committees of various provinces and cities in the Northeast, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, and other relevant departments reported on the progress of industrial production and capital construction plans and the problems existing in their work. Comrade Gao Gang spoke at the meeting, giving instructions for future work.

Since the Northeast Bureau held a symposium on production and capital construction in August, the completion of industrial production and capital construction plans has improved, with the index of plan completion increasing month by month. Many factories, mines, and construction sites have completed their plans ahead of schedule. However, the tasks to be completed in the fourth quarter are still very heavy. In terms of production, in addition to completing 21 percent of the total annual national plan value for the Northeast Industrial Department system, each factory and mine must also complete the increased production and conservation plan after mass discussion. In terms of capital construction, 39.1 percent of the annual plan must be completed in the fourth quarter. Although the completion of the increased production and conservation plan has not yet been statistically compiled, according to materials from some units, there is still a considerable distance from completing the plan. Moreover, preparations for next year's capital construction and production must also be completed in the fourth quarter.

In response to the above situation, Comrade Gao Gang pointed out: The improved completion of the plan in August and September shows that our plan is advanced and realistic, and that the enthusiasm of the workers is extremely high. As long as leading cadres at all levels of the Party committees, administrative departments, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League continue to strengthen their leadership in completing the national plan and the increased production and conservation plan, go deep into factories, mines, and construction sites to solve specific problems, continue to firmly grasp the promotion of advanced experience, and conscientiously pay attention to appropriately improving security and welfare conditions, the morale of the workers will be even higher, and the plan can be completed.

However, this only shows that we have the conditions to complete the plan, and to turn possibility into reality, we must make great efforts subjectively.

In order to successfully complete such arduous tasks in the fourth quarter, Comrade Gao Gang particularly emphasized specific leadership and the issue of improving worker safety and welfare.

Comrade Gao Gang said: In the past few years, we have done a lot in industrial leadership and learned a lot, but now we are not completely proficient yet, and we need to further delve into it. We should not obliterate past achievements, but if we do not further improve production management in a solid and down-to-earth manner, so that our production management skills are adapted to the creative labor enthusiasm of the workers, it will not be possible to continue to promote our industrial construction well. Comrade Gao Gang called on leading cadres at all levels of the Party committees, administrative departments, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League to go deep down, especially to those important factories and mines where the plan is not well completed, the difficulties are the greatest, and the potential strength has not been well utilized, to check, study, and help solve specific problems such as unreasonable labor organization, unbalanced equipment, disjointed processes, unsafe production, untimely supply of raw materials, and uneven production. We must combine improving production management and solving specific problems with completing tasks. We must not only complete the task, but also improve the management level. When going down to inspect, we must pay special attention to the promotion of advanced experience, and each factory and mine must designate special institutions and personnel to be responsible for promoting advanced experience. After going down, we must specifically help grassroots cadres summarize the experience in grassroots work. For example, how to be a factory director, how to be a Party committee secretary, how to be a grassroots trade union chairman and Communist Youth League secretary, how to be a workshop director, a workshop branch secretary, etc. Each province and city should summarize typical experiences to educate cadres.

Secondly, when mobilizing workers to complete tasks, we must simultaneously do a good job in worker safety and welfare. At present, enterprises have a large amount of major repair funds, technical organizational measures funds, and enterprise incentive funds. These funds must be used very reasonably to improve worker safety and welfare conditions—mainly to solve the key problems of each factory and mine, especially those important factories and mines, according to the characteristics of each industrial system. Such as gas and roof collapse problems in the coal mine system, ventilation problems in the textile system, smoke and dust problems in the smelting system, and so on. These important safety and welfare issues in important industrial systems and important factories and mines must be thoroughly resolved. Other issues such as housing and transportation should also be actively resolved gradually according to specific circumstances.

Finally, Comrade Gao Gang repeatedly emphasized: The success or failure of this year's national plan and increased production and conservation plan not only affects the national construction and the huge economic tasks of future construction, but also has a major political impact on the working class itself, both domestically and internationally. Our working class is the leading class of the country, a class that is consistent in word and deed. We must undertake the responsibility entrusted to us by the country and fulfill our promises. Party committees in all provinces and cities, all Party members and all workers in enterprises must adopt the most active attitude to improve production management and safety and welfare work, organize labor competitions well, promote advanced production experience, and strive to overfulfill this year's national plan and the increased production and conservation plan worth eight million tons of grain.

    东北局召开工业生产与基本建设会议
    高岗同志号召东北国营工业中的全体党员和全体职工，全力完成今年国家计划和增产节约计划，并做好明年生产与基本建设的准备工作
    中共中央东北局于十月五日至七日召开工业生产与基本建设会议。东北各省市党委和东北人民政府工业部、东北总工会等的有关负责干部，分别汇报了工业生产与基本建设计划完成的情况及工作中存在的问题。高岗同志在会上发言，对今后工作给予指示。
    自东北局于八月召开生产和基本建设座谈会以来，工业生产与基本建设计划完成的情况已有好转，完成计划的指数逐月上升，很多厂矿和工地提前完成了计划。但是，第四季度中应该完成的任务仍很繁重。在生产方面，东北工业部系统除要完成全年国家计划总值的百分之二十一外，各厂矿并要完成群众讨论后的增产节约计划；在基本建设方面，第四季度要完成全年计划的百分之三十九点一。增产节约计划完成情况虽尚未统计，但据某些单位材料看来，离完成计划尚有相当距离。而且，明年基本建设与生产的准备工作也要在第四季度内做好。
    针对上述情况，高岗同志指出：八、九月份计划完成情况好转，说明我们的计划是先进的而且是切合实际的，说明职工的劳动热情是极高的。只要各级党委、行政、工会、青年团领导干部继续加强对完成国家计划和增产节约计划的领导，深入厂矿和工地具体解决问题，继续抓紧推广先进经验，并认真注意适当地改善保安福利状况，职工的情绪会更加高涨，计划是可以完成的。
    但是，这只是说明我们有条件可以完成计划，而要把可能变成现实，还必须从主观上作很大努力。
    为了在第四季度中胜利地完成这样繁重的任务，高岗同志特别强调了具体领导与改善职工安全福利的问题。
    高岗同志说：几年来，我们在工业领导方面做了不少事情，学了不少东西，但是，现在我们还不是完全内行了，还需要再进一步深入地钻研。我们不应当抹煞过去的成绩，但如果不再进一步扎扎实实地改善生产管理，使我们的生产管理技能与职工的创造性的劳动热情相适应，就不可能很好地继续推动我们的工业建设前进。高岗同志号召各级党委、行政、工会、青年团领导干部都要深入下去，特别要深入到那些重要的、计划完成得不好的、困难最大的、潜在力量未很好发挥的厂矿中去，检查、研究和帮助解决劳动组织不合理、设备不平衡、工序不衔接、生产不安全、原材料供应不及时、生产不均衡等等具体问题。要把改善生产管理、解决具体问题与完成任务结合起来。既要完成任务，又要把管理水平提高一步。在下去检查的时候，要特别注意先进经验的推广情况，各厂矿都要指定专门的机构和人员专司推广先进经验的工作。下去以后，要具体帮助基层干部总结基层工作中的经验。比如怎样做厂长，怎样做党委书记，怎样做基层工会主席和青年团书记，怎样做车间主任、车间支部书记等等，每个省市都应总结出典型经验来教育干部。
    其次，在动员职工完成任务时，必须同时做好职工的安全福利工作。现在各企业都存有大量的大修理基金、技术组织措施费和企业奖励基金。这些钱一定要很合理地使用来改善职工的安全福利状况——主要地应根据各个产业系统的特点，解决各个厂矿特别是那些重要厂矿的关键性问题。如煤矿系统的瓦斯和冒顶问题、纺织系统的通风问题、冶炼系统的烟害灰尘问题等等。这些重要的产业系统、重要的厂矿中的重要的安全福利问题，必须彻底解决。其他如住房、交通等问题，亦应根据具体情况，逐步地积极设法解决。
    最后，高岗同志反复强调：今年国家计划与增产节约计划完成的好坏，不仅影响着全国建设和今后建设的巨大经济任务，而且是对工人阶级本身，对国内和国际上都有重大的政治影响。我们工人阶级是国家的领导阶级，是言行一致的阶级，我们必须承担起国家付托给我们的责任，实践自己的诺言。各省市党委、企业中的全体党员和全体职工，必须采取最积极的态度改进生产管理与安全福利工作，很好地组织劳动竞赛，推广先进生产经验，争取超额完成今年的国家计划与价值八百万吨粮食的增产节约计划。
