Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The representatives elected by the Australian people to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference were obstructed by the Menzies government in various ways, and some were unable to attend the conference. These barred representatives sent greetings to the Peace Conference from Sydney on October 1, expressing their determination to strive with greater efforts to realize the goals of the Peace Conference and world peace.
    The telegram reads as follows:
    "The Australian representatives who were refused passports and travel facilities to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference send their congratulations to the Peace Conference, and they are determined to strive at a higher level for the goals of the Peace Conference and world peace. We applaud the nine Australian representatives who defeated the ban imposed by the Menzies government at the request of the U.S. State Department and are now attending the Peace Conference in Beijing. We pledge to make efforts to hold a grand peace conference in Australia after they return. The Peace Conference in Beijing has greatly helped to expand the peace movement in Australia. We cannot attend the Peace Conference because the government has fully mobilized its power, including the vigilance of the navy and other pro-war elements. But the Menzies government, with this action, has given the Beijing Peace Conference the greatest possible publicity, and its attack on the rights of the people has caused serious concern at home. We are deeply convinced that peace will triumph over the evil forces that create war."
    The telegram was signed by the Reverend Van Eerde, an Australian representative who had attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

    澳大利亚被阻代表
    致电祝贺和平会议
    【新华社三日讯】澳大利亚人民选出参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表，因为孟席斯政府多方阻挠，一部分未能出席会议。这些被阻代表在十月一日自悉尼电和平会议致意，并表示决心以更大努力为实现和平会议的目标和世界和平而奋斗。
    电文如下：
    “被拒绝给予出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的护照和旅行设备的澳大利亚代表们，向和平会议致祝贺之意，他们决心在更高的水平上为和平会议的目标和世界和平而奋斗。我们向那击败了孟席斯政府应美国国务院的要求而实施的禁令，现在在北京出席和平会议的九个澳大利亚代表鼓掌。我们保证进行努力，争取在他们回来之后，在澳大利亚举行盛大的和平会议。北京的和平会议已大大地帮助了在澳大利亚扩展和平运动。我们不能出席和平会议，是因为政府完全动员了它的力量，包括海军和其他主张战争的人的警戒。但是孟席斯政府用它这种行动给了北京的和平会议以最大可能的一次宣扬，它对人民权利的攻击已引起国内的严重忧虑。我们深信，和平将战胜制造战争的恶势力。”
    电文由曾出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的澳大利亚代表范·伊尔德牧师署名。
