	The Precious Days of the Romanian Army Song and Dance Ensemble in China
	Monaisigu·Kaoernailiu, Head of the Romanian People's Republic Army Song and Dance Ensemble

	The Romanian People's Republic Army Song and Dance Ensemble has spent nearly two months in the People's Republic of China. So far, the ensemble has performed twenty-eight shows in Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places, with an audience of nearly 250,000 people.

	The ensemble members feel very happy and honored because they can use their performances to consolidate and deepen the cultural exchange and friendship between the Chinese and Romanian people.

	In every city the Romanian People's Republic Army Song and Dance Ensemble visited in China, just like in Beijing, the great capital of China, we were warmly welcomed, and we were surrounded by enthusiastic cheers at all times. The leading comrades of the ensemble were also honored to be received by Chairman Mao, which fully demonstrates the close friendship between our two peoples.

	After we return to Romania, we will constantly publicize the enthusiastic welcome and love we received from the great Chinese people. At the same time, we will tell all the Romanian people about the peaceful and happy life of the Chinese people and the great revolutionary struggle and ideals of the Chinese people, which we have personally seen and recognized during these precious days in China. We are convinced that the working people of the People's Republic of China are wholeheartedly safeguarding the cause of peace in Asia and the world, and under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, they are consolidating and prospering their free motherland, which is playing a huge role in the peace and democracy camp. We have also seen the Chinese people's deep internationalist spirit and their infinite respect and love for the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin.

	The Chinese people's strong will and confidence in defending peace and striving for peace are manifested in their heroic, selfless, and constructive labor.

	In Shanghai, we visited a large textile factory and talked to the workers. They told us about their past difficult lives and the happy lives they have built today. They are all overfulfilling their production tasks and constantly improving the quality of their products. We also visited the countryside and visited the Land Reform Exhibition in Hankou, where we learned about the differences between the Chinese countryside in the past and today. In the past, it was hunger, oppression, and darkness; but today, after land reform and the elimination of feudalism, schools, clinics, cooperatives, and cultural centers have been generally established in the countryside, and the lives of Chinese farmers are becoming happier and happier.

	In Hankou, we saw a huge model of the inclined surface of the Jingjiang Dike. In Nanjing, we saw Chinese intellectuals learning Filatov's method in a workers' hospital. In the Beijing Library, we visited the cultural treasures of the Chinese people. We fully saw with what will and strength the Chinese working people are serving their motherland and peace.

	Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, the labor and struggle of the Chinese people have achieved remarkable results. The song and dance ensemble was honored to visit great peace constructions, such as the Workers' Cultural Palace and workers' residences in Shanghai, the hospital in Hankou, the Workers' Cultural Palace in Nanjing, and so on. After returning to Beijing, we saw a documentary film of the Huai River's massive construction project. The greatness of the project truly amazed us. These great achievements of the Chinese people have allowed us to further understand the great power of the Chinese people. At the same time, we saw their unparalleled hatred for our common enemy – the American imperialists and their lackeys – who vainly attempt to undermine the thriving new lives of the people's democratic countries.

	The exhibition of the U.S. government's bacteriological warfare crimes in Korea and Northeast China ruthlessly exposed the true face of the American imperialists, the deadly enemies of the Chinese and Romanian people, as well as the people of the whole world. The Chinese people are not afraid of the scare tactics of the "paper tiger". They firmly believe that they will surely win.

	On October 1st, we saw the sea of people reporting their achievements to Chairman Mao and expressing their determination to continue to advance along the path of peace and democracy. We saw the parade of the Chinese working people and the review of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We are convinced that the great heroic people are absolutely not afraid of their enemies and are able to defeat them. We are convinced that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and with the help of the Soviet people who are building communism, will advance from victory to victory.

	Finally, I would like to especially point out that every member of the Romanian People's Republic Army Song and Dance Ensemble will bring back to our motherland, Romania, the love we have received from the Chinese people. We are very grateful to the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government for inviting the song and dance ensemble, which enabled us to spend a series of extremely valuable days in the People's China.

	After returning to our own country, every comrade of the Romanian Song and Dance Ensemble will become an enthusiastic fighter for deepening the friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples and widely publicizing the great achievements of the People's China.

    罗马尼亚部队歌舞团在中国的可贵的日子
    罗马尼亚人民共和国部队歌舞团团长  莫耐斯古·考尔耐利乌
    罗马尼亚人民共和国部队歌舞团在中华人民共和国度过了将近两月的时间，到目前为止，歌舞团曾在北京、南京、上海、杭州、广州、汉口等地演出二十八场，观众将近二十五万人。
    歌舞团团员们都感到非常高兴和荣誉，因为他们能以自己的演出来巩固和加深中国人民与罗马尼亚人民之间的文化交流和友谊。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国部队歌舞团在中国所到过的城市里，好像在伟大的中国的首都北京一样，都受到热情的款待，我们时时刻刻被热烈的欢呼包围着。歌舞团的领导同志们还很荣幸地受到了毛主席的接见，这充分地表现了我们两国人民紧密的友情。
    当我们回到罗马尼亚以后，我们会时时刻刻宣扬我们所受到的伟大中国人民对我们的热情款待和热爱。同时，还要把我们在中国这些可珍贵的日子里所亲自看到和认识到的中国人民的和平幸福的生活和中国人民伟大的革命斗争和理想告诉给全罗马尼亚人民。我们确信中华人民共和国的劳动人民正全心全意保卫亚洲和全世界和平的事业，并在中国共产党的领导下巩固和繁荣自己在和平民主阵营中发挥着巨大力量的自由祖国。我们同时也看到了中国人民深厚的国际主义精神和对苏联及斯大林同志的无限的尊敬与敬爱。
    中国人民保卫和平及争取和平的坚强意志和信心表现在自己英勇的、忘我的、建设的劳动中。
    我们在上海曾访问过一个很大的纺织工厂，并且和工人们谈了话，他们告诉我们，他们过去所过的困苦的生活，和今天他们自己建立起来的幸福的生活。他们在生产上都是超额的完成生产任务和不断的提高生产质量。我们也访问了乡村，并在汉口参观了土地改革展览会，在那里我们了解到中国农村过去和今天的不同。在过去，是饥饿、压迫和黑暗；而今天，经过土地改革，消灭了封建制度以后，农村里已普遍地设立起学校、诊疗所、合作社和文化馆，中国农民的生活是越来越幸福了。
    在汉口我们看到了巨大的荆江大堤倾斜面的模型，在南京我们看到了中国知识分子在工人医院中学习了费拉托夫的方法，在北京图书馆中参观了中国人民的文化宝藏，我们充分地看到中国劳动人民是用怎样的意志和力量来为祖国为和平而服务的。
    中国人民在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的领导下的劳动和斗争获得了卓越的成绩。歌舞团很荣幸地访问了伟大的和平建设，例如在上海的工人文化宫和工人住宅，在汉口的医院，在南京的工人文化宫等等。回到北京后，我们又看见淮河巨大建设工程的记录影片，工程的伟大真使我们惊异。中国人民这些伟大的成就，使我们更进一步地了解了中国人民的巨大力量。同时我们看到他们对那妄想破坏人民民主国家欣欣向荣的新的生活的我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义者及其仆从们的无比憎恨。
    美国政府在朝鲜和中国东北所进行的细菌战罪行展览会，无情地揭露了中国人民和罗马尼亚人民以及全世界人民的死敌美帝国主义者的真面目。中国人民是不怕“纸老虎”的恐吓的，他们深信自己一定会胜利。
    在十月一日我们看见了向毛主席报告自己的成绩，表示自己不断地沿着和平民主道路前进的决心的海一般的人群，我们看见了中国劳动人民的游行队伍和中国人民解放军的检阅。我们深信伟大英雄的人民是绝不怕他们的敌人的，并能够击溃敌人。我们深信中国人民在毛泽东同志的领导下和正在建设共产主义的苏联人民的帮助下从胜利走向胜利。
    最后我要特别指出：罗马尼亚人民共和国部队歌舞团的每一个团员会把我们受到的中国人民对我们的热爱带回我们的祖国罗马尼亚去。我们非常感谢中央人民政府文化部对歌舞团的邀请，这使我们能在人民的中国度过一连串极其可贵的日子。
    回到自己的祖国以后，罗马尼亚歌舞团的每一个同志都将成为加深中罗两国人民的友谊，广泛宣扬人民中国伟大成就的热情的战士。
