    Good Land Can Turn Bad if Farming Techniques Are Not Emphasized
    Comrade Editor: During the autumn inspection of abundant harvests in Wangjiazhuang, Fifth District, Licheng, Shanxi, the following situation was discovered: Individual households' good land had turned bad, while agricultural production cooperatives' bad land had turned good. In this village, there was a nominal mutual aid team member named Li Fengxiang, whose conservative thinking was very serious. For many years, he had relied on his good plot of land to produce grain. He often said, "My land is the best in the village; even without fertilizer, I'll still get a good harvest." Therefore, he was unwilling to join the mutual aid team, nor did he pay attention to farming techniques. Speaking of his land, not only the old and young of Wangjiazhuang knew about it, but even people from neighboring villages were clear that it was indeed Wangjiazhuang's top-quality land, with an expected yield of 2.1 shi. Therefore, the masses gave it the nickname "Grain Stack Land." However, due to Li Fengxiang's lack of attention to technology, continuous rough cultivation, and insufficient fertilizer application, this good land had turned bad this year. This year, Li Fengxiang only plowed this land twice and hoed it twice, applying only a little over 80 dan of wheat bran fertilizer per mu. As a result, the millet grown on "Grain Stack Land" was very poor. The stalks were short, the ears were small, the grains were shriveled, and the chaff was large. After evaluation and weighing, this famous "Grain Stack Land" only yielded 390 jin of grain per mu, which was lower than the village's average millet yield of 465 jin per mu. Conversely, although the land of the Dong Taoqi Agricultural Production Cooperative was not as good as "Grain Stack Land," it had organized intensive processing and fertilization, repaired edges and built embankments, and improved the soil, resulting in an average harvest of 535 jin per mu for the cooperative's 58.7 mu of millet. The cooperative had five plots of stony, infertile land with an expected yield of only 6 dou per mu. However, due to the implementation of collective management, the application of 200 dan of sheep manure per mu, and the planting of the excellent variety "Dao Ba Qi" millet, along with careful and timely cultivation, each mu yielded 612 jin. Compared to Li Fengxiang's "Grain Stack Land," this was a stark contrast.
    The peasant representatives from various villages who came to Wangjiazhuang to participate in the inspection of abundant harvests, upon seeing such a fact, all said: This is how to get more grain and become rich! As long as we participate in agricultural production cooperatives, overcome conservative thinking, and improve farming techniques, we can do it. The representatives of each village expressed their intention to learn from the Dong Taoqi Agricultural Production Cooperative. Li Fengxiang also realized the harm of "going it alone" and conservatism and requested to join the agricultural production cooperative.

### 不讲究耕作技术，好地也会变成坏地

    不讲究耕作技术，好地也会变成坏地
    编辑同志：山西黎城五区王家庄在秋季检查丰产情况时，发现了这样一件事情：单干户的好地变成了坏地，农业生产合作社的坏地变成了好地。这个村有一个挂名的互助组员李逢祥，他的保守思想很严重，许多年来，他就凭着自己的一块好地打粮食。他常说：“我那块地，全村数第一，就是不上肥，打粮食也少不了。”所以他既不愿意参加互助组，也不讲究耕作技术。提起他那块地，不仅王家庄的老少都知道，就是邻村的人们也很清楚，这确是王家庄的特等好地，应产量是二点一石，因此，群众就给它送了个外号，叫“谷堆地”。但是，由于李逢祥不讲究技术，连年耕作粗糙、上粪又不多，到了今年，这块好地已经变成了坏地。今年，李逢祥在这块土地上仅仅耕了两次，锄了两次，每亩只上了八十多担麦糠粪。因此，“谷堆地”长的谷子很不好。秆低、穗小、籽秕、糠大。经评比过秤以后，这块有名的“谷堆地”每亩只打了三百九十斤粮食，赶不上全村谷地每亩四百六十五斤的平均产量。相反的，董桃气农业生产合作社的土地虽然不如“谷堆地”好，但经过组织起来加工加肥、修边垒堰、改良土壤，却使全社五十八亩七分谷子，每亩平均收获五百三十五斤。该社有五片石厚土薄每亩只有六斗应产量的下等地，由于实行了集体经营，每亩地施羊肥二百担，种了优良品种“刀把齐”谷子，耕作又周到适时，每亩地竟收获六百一十二斤。这和李逢祥的“谷堆地”比起来，实在是个鲜明的对照。
    到王家庄来参加检查丰产情况的各村农民代表看到这样一个事实，都说：这可找到了多打粮食，由穷变富的门路了，只要参加农业生产合作社，克服保守思想，改进耕作技术就行。各村的代表都表示要向董桃气农业生产合作社学习。李逢祥也认识到了“单干”和保守的害处，要求参加农业生产合作社。　　　　张文显　郭席珍
