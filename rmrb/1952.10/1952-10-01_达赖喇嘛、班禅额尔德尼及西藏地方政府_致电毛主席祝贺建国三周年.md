Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 30th -- The Dalai Lama, Panchen Erdeni, and the Kashag (Tibetan Local Government) sent telegrams to Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government on the 27th, congratulating the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    The Dalai Lama's Congratulatory Telegram
    To Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:
    On the occasion of the joyous celebration by the people of the whole country of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government, in addition to holding enthusiastic celebrations in the Tibetan region, I would like to extend my highest respects to you on behalf of all the monks and laypeople of Tibet. Over the past three years, under your leadership and that of the Central People's Government, the motherland has achieved great success. Especially since Tibet's peaceful liberation, for more than a year the Tibetan people have returned to the big family of the motherland, the People's Liberation Army and the Tibetan people have been closely united, consolidating national defense, developing production, building roads, establishing hospitals and schools, and constructing Tibet in all aspects; and have achieved great success. I firmly believe that in the future, under your leadership and that of the Central People's Government, as in the period since liberation, Tibet's religion will be able to develop freely, and the people's lives will be improved day by day.
    Finally, I wholeheartedly congratulate:
    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all fraternal nationalities in China!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Dalai Lama

    Panchen Erdeni's Congratulatory Telegram
    To Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities:
    Under the wise leadership of you, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, the achievements of our motherland in all aspects over the past three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China have surpassed any era in history. The people of the whole country are meeting the high tide of large-scale economic construction with unparalleled confidence and perseverance, which is extremely exciting. Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet a year ago, with the help of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet, the Tibetan people have begun a new life. Based only on what I have seen in the more than three months since I returned to Tashilhunpo Monastery: the issuance of agricultural loans has provided some assistance to the production of poor farmers, and the recent industrial loans have more vigorously assisted industrial production. The state-owned Tibet Trading Company has signed a contract with Tibetan wool merchants to purchase wool, which not only solves the problem of the wool merchants' unsold wool, but also solves the livelihood problems of the vast pastoral areas. Medical personnel treat Tibetan people without compensation, ensuring the health of the Tibetan people. All of these have allowed the Tibetan people to experience the warmth of returning to the big family of friendship and cooperation among all nationalities of the motherland from their actual lives.
    On the occasion of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I would like to sincerely lead the political and religious officials and monks and laypeople of Tashilhunpo Monastery in Rear Tibet to extend our highest respects to you—the leader of our great motherland—and congratulate our great motherland on the brilliant achievements it has achieved!
    Panchen Erdeni

    The Tibetan Local Government's Congratulatory Telegram
    To Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:
    On the occasion of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, in addition to holding grand ceremonies to celebrate warmly, we would like to extend our highest respects to you—the great Chairman Mao!
    Since Tibet's peaceful liberation, and the Tibetan people's return to the big family of all nationalities of the motherland, on the basis of the close unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, we are working hard to carry out the great cause of consolidating national defense and various constructions; we fully believe that in the future, Tibet's religion will surely be able to develop freely, and the people's lives will surely be further improved. We will strive to thoroughly realize the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." We sincerely wish Long Live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all fraternal nationalities in China!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Kashag of the Tibetan Local Government

    伟大的各民族人民领袖毛主席：
    在您和中国共产党，中央人民政府的英明领导下，中华人民共和国建国三年来，我们祖国在各方面的成就都超过了历史上的任何时代。全国人民正以无比的信心和毅力迎接全国大规模经济建设高潮，令人无限兴奋。西藏和平解放一年来，在人民解放军进藏部队帮助下，西藏人民已开始了新的生活。仅就我返回札什伦布寺的三个多月所见到的：如发放农贷款对穷苦农民的生产给了一定的帮助，最近的手工业贷款，更有力地帮助了手工业生产，国营西藏贸易公司与西藏羊毛商人签订了收购羊毛合同，不仅解决了羊毛商人的存毛出路问题，也解决了广大牧区人民的生活问题。医务人员无代价地给藏族人民治病，使藏族人民健康得到保障。所有这些，已使西藏人民从实际生活中体验到回到祖国各民族友爱合作大家庭的温暖。
    际此中华人民共和国建国三周年纪念之际，谨以至诚率领后藏札什伦布寺所属政教官员，僧俗民众向您——我们伟大祖国的领导者，致以崇高的敬意，并祝贺我们伟大祖国已获得的光辉成就！
    班禅额尔德尼
