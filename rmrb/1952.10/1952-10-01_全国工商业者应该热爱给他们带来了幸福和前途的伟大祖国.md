    National Industrialists and Businessmen Should Love the Great Motherland That Has Brought Them
    Happiness and a Bright Future
    Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction  Huang Yanpei
    Today is the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the happiest day for the Chinese people, and also the most historically significant day since the Soviet October Revolution. Because from this day three years ago, not only has the face of China undergone tremendous changes, but also a profoundly deep impact has been generated in the lives of people all over the world. In the past three years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country, following the direction he indicated, have achieved brilliant victories on the military front, the economic front, the cultural front, the ideological front, and on the fronts of land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea. The victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements this year has laid a solid foundation for the upcoming large-scale national construction.
    The people of the whole country have begun to live an increasingly happy life, and are increasingly respected by the people of all countries in the world day by day. Everyone knows that these glories, this happiness, and the infinitely bright future that is already visible, would have been absolutely impossible without the leadership of Chairman Mao and the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The glory, happiness, and infinitely bright future that the vast majority of people are increasingly enjoying is the content of our new China. All people who love the glory and happiness of the vast majority of people cannot but love the new China. Patriotism has become a universally developing ideology among the broad masses of people in all strata of our country, and has also become a powerful weapon for us to carry out various patriotic movements.
    China's national industrialists and businessmen suffered bitterly from the oppression and squeezing out by imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and bureaucrat-capitalism in the past. Therefore, before the establishment of the new China, they participated in the revolutionary struggle to establish a people's China for a certain period. In the three years since the founding of the country, they have played a certain role in national construction, the restoration and development of production, the exchange of materials, and in patriotic movements such as resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea. The patriotic thoughts and behaviors of national industrialists and businessmen have been praised by the people, while their "five poisons" thoughts and behaviors have also been severely criticized and opposed. Because the "five poisons" thoughts and patriotism are completely contradictory. After the victorious conclusion of the great "Five-Anti" movement, we are deeply convinced that the patriotism of China's national industrialists and businessmen will become clearer and more consolidated.
    First of all, we must not be afraid of repetition and repeatedly point out that China's national industrialists and businessmen have a role to play at the present stage, and the state will definitely adhere to the policy of supporting private economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and encourage their active operation. As early as March of this year, Chairman Mao instructed us that private capital has made contributions in the new China and still needs considerable development on the way to socialism. Chairman Mao also told us: There is nothing wrong with capitalists seeking profits, as long as they can take into account the interests of the country and the workers; it is not good to only seek personal gain without regard to the interests of the country and the workers. Chairman Mao also instructed industrialists and businessmen to study the Common Program well. This means that it is certain that we industrialists and businessmen have a role and a position in the new China. There are also clear ways to play this role and maintain this position. As long as our national industrialists and businessmen can actively engage in production and management under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, and at the same time transform themselves with the Common Program as the criterion, this is fulfilling their due responsibilities to the country and realizing Chairman Mao's current expectations for industrialists and businessmen. I believe that the patriotic thought of Chinese national industrialists and businessmen after the "Five-Anti" movement should have such a clear content.
    Secondly, we should point out that as long as Chinese national industrialists and businessmen fulfill their responsibilities at the present stage, they do not have to worry about their future. Some people always cannot let go of such a question: What will happen to me when socialism is implemented? Chairman Mao had already answered this question in June 1950: "As long as someone is truly willing to serve the people, and has indeed helped and done good things during the period when the people are still in difficulty, and continues to do so consistently, and does not give up halfway, then the people and the people's government have no reason to abandon him, and have no reason not to give him the opportunity to live and the opportunity to serve." Comrades in the industrial and commercial circles! Chairman Mao has clearly instructed us, so what else can we doubt? I think what deserves our attention is no longer the question of whether national industrialists and businessmen have a future, but how they can follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "truly serve the people" and "continue to do so consistently, and not give up halfway," and also how to create the preconditions for their own opportunities to live and opportunities to serve. As long as we recognize the true problem, work hard according to Chairman Mao's words, and strive to be an honest patriot and a thorough executor of the Common Program, our future, to be sure, is very bright. Conversely, if we groan without being ill, or hesitate to move forward, we will be delaying our own future, failing the country, and failing Chairman Mao's original intention of all his kind teachings to us. The reason why Chinese national industrialists and businessmen have a role now and a way out in the future is because they are originally in a new democratic country with such a great leader as Chairman Mao. If we look at the situation of industrial and commercial circles in other countries in the world and compare them, we will feel the supreme happiness of Chinese national industrialists and businessmen even more, and thus feel the incomparability of the motherland even more lovable. In today's world, there are three situations for the bourgeoisie: one is the reactionary bourgeoisie of imperialist countries such as the United States and Britain; everyone can foresee the inevitable destruction of imperialism. One is the bourgeoisie of semi-colonial countries; Chinese national industrialists and businessmen have experienced this taste, and recalling it, it is probably "unbearable to look back"! One is the bourgeoisie of our new China. Think back to the three situations, compare them with each other, and we cannot help but feel extremely excited for Chinese national industrialists and businessmen. The People's Republic of China is so lovable to China's industrial and commercial circles! China's industrial and commercial circles are so happy! In the new democratic period, we participated in the state power, obtained legitimate development, and national bourgeoisie members, through self-education and self-transformation, will still be able to steadily move towards socialism in the future. We should admit this situation, this future, is the greatest happiness of Chinese industrialists and businessmen. Other countries cannot imagine it. We should thank Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party.
    Finally, we should point out that the bright road for Chinese industrialists and businessmen is no longer open to doubt. If we want to take this road well, we must first thoroughly transform our own thinking. After the National Day, industrialists and businessmen across the country should, on the one hand, more correctly promote the enthusiasm for production and management, and on the other hand, enthusiastically and conscientiously launch the study of the Common Program, and cultivate and strengthen their own Common Program thinking and patriotism in the study, and strive to exert the greatest strength in the upcoming large-scale economic construction. This is our most sincere hope for the industrial and commercial circles on National Day.

    全国工商业者应该热爱给他们带来了
    幸福和前途的伟大祖国
    中国民主建国会总会主任委员  黄炎培
    今天是中华人民共和国开国纪念的三周年，是中国人民最快乐的日子，也是苏联十月革命以后，最富有世界历史意义的日子。因为从三年前的这一天起，不仅中国的面貌发生了巨大变化，就在全世界的人民生活中间，也产生了无比深刻的影响。三年当中，全国人民在毛主席领导下，依照了他所指示的方向，在军事战线上、经济战线上、文化战线上，思想战线上以及土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝的战线上，都取得了辉煌的胜利。今年“三反”“五反”运动的胜利，更给即将到来的全国大规模建设，奠定了强固的基础。
    全国人民已开始过着日益幸福的生活，并一天一天地愈益受到世界各国人民的尊敬。这些光荣、这些幸福、和已经看得到的无限美好的前途，谁都知道，没有毛主席的领导，没有中华人民共和国的成立，是绝对不可能得到的。最大多数人日益增加的光荣、幸福和无限美好的前途，就是我们新中国的内容。一切爱好最大多数人光荣和幸福的人们，不能不爱新中国。爱国主义思想已成为我国各阶层广大人民普遍发展的思想，也成为我国开展各种爱国运动的有力武器。
    中国的民族工商业者，过去吃尽帝国主义、国民党反动派、官僚资本压迫和排挤的苦头，因此，他们在新中国建立以前，曾在一定时期中参加了建立人民中国的革命斗争。建国三年来，他们对国家的建设，对生产的恢复与发展，物资的交流等工作，以及在抗美援朝等爱国运动中，都起了一定的作用。民族工商业者的爱国思想和行为受到人民的称许，同时他们的“五毒”思想和行为也受到严正的批判和反对。因为“五毒”思想和爱国主义思想是完全抵触的。在伟大的“五反”运动胜利结束之后，我们深信中国民族工商业者的爱国主义思想将更加明确起来，更加巩固起来。
    首先我们要不惮词费一再指出，中国民族工商业者在现阶段是有作用的，国家对待他们一定坚持着扶助有利于国计民生的私人经济事业，并鼓励其积极经营的方针。早在今年三月间毛主席就指示我们，私人资本在新中国是有贡献的，在走向社会主义方向的时候，还需要相当的发展。毛主席还告诉我们：资本家图利没有什么不好，只要能够顾到国家和工人的利益；不顾国家之利、工人之利，只图个人之利，这才是不好的。毛主席还指示工商业家要好好地学习共同纲领。这就是说，我们工商业者在新中国里面有作用、有地位，是可以肯定的。有发挥这样作用、保持这样地位的办法，也是清清楚楚的。只要我们民族工商业者能在工人阶级、国营经济领导之下积极地从事生产、经营，同时又以共同纲领为准则来改造自己，这就是对国家尽了应尽的责任，实现了毛主席此时对于工商业者的期望。中国民族工商业者在“五反”运动以后的爱国主义思想，我以为应该具备这样明确的内容。
    其次，我们应该指出：只要中国民族工商业者善尽其在现阶段的责任，他们是不愁没有前途的。有人老放不下这样的问题，到实行社会主义时我怎样呢？对于这一问题，毛主席早在一九五○年六月间已经回答过了：“只要谁肯真正为人民效力，在人民还有困难的时期内确实帮了忙，做了好事，并且是一贯地做下去，并不半途而废，那末，人民和人民的政府是没有理由不要他的，是没有理由不给他以生活的机会和效力的机会的。”工商界的同志们！毛主席这样清楚地指示我们，我们还有什么可以怀疑的呢？我以为值得我们注意的已经不是民族工商业者有无前途的问题，而是他们如何遵照毛主席的指示“真正为人民效力”“并且是一贯地做下去，并不半途而废”的问题，同时也是如何为他们自己创造生活机会、效力机会的前提的问题。只要我们认清楚真实问题之所在，依照毛主席的话，使劲儿干，努力做一个诚实的爱国主义者，做一个共同纲领的彻底执行者，我们的前途，肯定地说，是很光明的。反之，如果无病呻吟，或者踌躇不进，那是自己耽误了前程，有负国家，也有负毛主席对于我们一切亲切教诲的原意。中国民族工商业者之所以现在有作用，以后有出路，是因为他们原在有毛主席这样伟大领袖的新民主主义的国家之中。如果看一看世界上其他各国工商界的情况，加以比较，我们就更会感觉到中国民族工商业者的无上幸福，因而也就越发感觉到祖国的无比可爱。在今天世界中，资产阶级有三种情况：一种是美英等帝国主义国家的反动资产阶级；帝国主义的必然毁灭的前途，这是人人都能想见的。一种是半殖民地国家的资产阶级；此中滋味，中国民族工商业者是过来人，回忆起来，怕真是“不堪回首”吧！一种就是我们新中国的资产阶级。三种情况，前后回想一下，彼此对比一下，我们不能不为中国民族工商业者感到无比兴奋。中华人民共和国对于中国工商界真是太可爱了！中国的工商界真是太幸福了！在新民主主义时期，我们参加了国家政权，得到正当的发展，民族资产阶级分子经过自我教育和自我改造，在将来还有可能稳步地走向社会主义，我们应该承认这种情况，这种前途，是中国工商业者最大的幸福。别的国家是不能想像的。应该感谢毛主席和中国共产党。
    最后我们应该指出：中国工商业者的光明大路，是再也不容怀疑的了。要想很好地走上这条路，必须先要彻底地改造自己的思想。全国的工商业者，在国庆以后应该一面更正确地发扬生产和经营的积极性，一面热烈地、认真地展开共同纲领的学习，要在学习中培养并加强自己的共同纲领思想和爱国主义思想，争取在即将到来的大规模经济建设中，发挥最大的力量。这是我们在国庆日对工商界的最恳切的希望。
