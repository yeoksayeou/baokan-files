Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 10th: On the same day that Harrison announced the indefinite suspension of the armistice negotiations, Clark in Tokyo and Acheson in Washington simultaneously issued statements with content as absurd as Harrison's remarks at the negotiation meetings, attempting to shift the responsibility for sabotaging the armistice negotiations to the Korean and Chinese side. These pre-prepared statements demonstrate that the US side had already decided to close the door to negotiations at the meeting on October 8th.

However, contrary to the US side's expectations, General Nam Il presented a fair and reasonable new proposal at the meeting on the 8th, adopting some of the US side's suggestions. At that time, the US side arrogantly and completely refused to pay attention to the Korean and Chinese side's new proposal, and hastily and unreasonably withdrew from the meeting without waiting for our side to speak, thereby achieving the goal of suspending the armistice negotiations. But the US side knows that if the people of the world—including the American people—knew this fact, they would not be able to escape the responsibility of refusing to negotiate and deliberately sabotaging the negotiations. Therefore, they are now completely silent about General Nam Il's new proposal, attempting to deceive the world with this despicable news blackout. For example, the US military radio station in Tokyo broadcast on the 9th: "The Allied Forces suggested an indefinite adjournment until the Communist side either accepts one of the Allied Forces' three proposals or presents a solution of their own." Clark also openly lied in his statement, saying that the Korean and Chinese side "did not put forward their own constructive suggestions." But this kind of deception cannot cover up the truth. The world has now begun to learn the content of General Nam Il's new proposal. It is clear that since the US side refused to consider the Korean and Chinese side's new proposal and put forward the request for an indefinite adjournment, then the responsibility for sabotaging the armistice negotiations should undoubtedly be borne entirely by the US side, which can never be evaded by a statement.

In his statement, Acheson admitted that the three proposals put forward by Harrison on September 28th were just old tricks to maintain the so-called "no forced repatriation" principle in a different guise. The Korean and Chinese side has repeatedly stated that the principle of repatriating all prisoners of war stipulated in the Geneva Convention is the only principle that the Korean and Chinese side adheres to. The US side is now using so-called "suggestions" that completely violate this internationally recognized principle to force the Korean and Chinese side to "choose one," which shows that they are only using these so-called "suggestions" to deceive the people of the world and thereby escape their responsibility for delaying the negotiations, and they simply do not want to solve the problem. Although Acheson and Clark attempted to re-peddle the tattered goods that have long been notorious in their propaganda market, describing the prisoners of war forcibly detained by them as prisoners of war who "resist repatriation to the death," a series of prisoner-of-war massacre incidents in US prisoner-of-war camps has completely exposed this lie. The massacre on Jeju Island on October 1st shows that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, who are called "anti-communist collaborators" by the US side, are actually completely patriotic and firmly demand repatriation. In contrast to these bloody facts, the so-called "humanitarian principles" and "individual rights" in Acheson and Clark's mouths seem extremely shameless. In the eyes of the American aggressors, prisoners of war are only cannon fodder that can be driven to carry out aggressive wars, and not people who should be respected, and if they demand any individual rights, even the right to celebrate the national day of their motherland, they will be slaughtered. Acheson's so-called "basic principles of the United States and the United Nations" and Clark's so-called "basic ideals" are to send prisoners of war to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs in order to "make the most effective use of them" for aggressive wars. The United States Information Service openly and vulgarly reported on October 1st that a US Department of Defense official pointed out that "in future wars," if 16,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who supposedly "do not wish to be repatriated" obtain so-called "freedom," it "will greatly benefit the allies." In pursuit of this "benefit," 27,000 prisoners of war have already been unilaterally handed over to the Syngman Rhee gang by the US side, and 11,000 prisoners of war are being transferred. This is the concrete realization of the US side's so-called "ideal."

After committing all these lawless crimes, Clark now has the gall to nauseatingly talk about "human rights." But the facts prove that the American aggressors simply do not understand what human rights are. They use gasoline bombs, bacteriological weapons, and other large-scale massacre weapons against peaceful towns and peaceful residents in Korea, attempting to deprive the Korean people of their right to survival; they massacre prisoners of war who demand repatriation on a large scale, attempting to deprive the prisoners of war of their right to return home and live a peaceful life; they massacre and abuse people of color in the United States, practice racial discrimination, and suppress people who are fighting for peace, attempting to deprive the American people of their democratic rights; they establish military bases all over the world and send their troops to foreign countries to run amok, attempting to deprive the people of these countries of their rights to independence and autonomy. In the eyes of these thugs who violently trample on human rights, all solemn international treaties are just scraps of paper that they can tear up at will. They are a group of bloodthirsty beasts who have lost their human conscience. All they have is the 독재자's vicious desire to use the blood of innocent people to exchange for more dollars for themselves!

In their statements, Acheson and Clark repeatedly reassure their vassal states that the US side's suspension of armistice negotiations "does not mean that they have lost hope for an armistice." This is clearly to appease the dissatisfaction of these vassal states in order to drag them into greater adventures in the future. In fact, the US side has used the suspension of armistice negotiations to cut off the retreat of these vassal states, forcing them to face the fact that the armistice negotiations have stopped and the war is still going on. In this way, the American aggressors can force them to agree to the American aggressive policy at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly and spur them to contribute more people and money to take chestnuts out of the fire for Wall Street in a larger-scale war. United Press International reported on the 8th that in the United Nations, most people believe that "the suspension of negotiations opens the door for a comprehensive discussion of the political issues of the Korean War at the United Nations General Assembly meeting to be held next week." The "Wall Street Journal" revealed on October 3rd that "the United States will urge the United Nations General Assembly to pass a tough resolution to tell the Communists that they should accept the recently proposed armistice proposals." The newspaper also said that if the US side's demands are rejected, the US "decision-makers and Pentagon officials are already preparing more violent retaliation plans to deal with North Korea and Communist China." American newspapers and news agencies have long been clamoring for vassal states to "shoulder more of the burden of the Korean War."

The facts have fully proven that the US side deliberately uses the sabotage of the Korean armistice negotiations to expand the war and threaten the world, while the Korean and Chinese side has demonstrated a firm commitment to continuing negotiations on the internationally recognized principle of prisoner repatriation. Any destructive means and threats of intimidation by the US side cannot shake the Korean and Chinese side's will to adhere to principles and persist in consultation and negotiation. The shameless behavior of the US side has been condemned and opposed by the whole world and will mobilize peace-loving people all over the world more widely to fight to defeat the conspiracies of the American aggressors and to save peace.

### 艾奇逊克拉克发表荒谬声明  妄图推卸美方破坏停战谈判罪责  我方合理新建议竟遭拒绝证明美方蓄意扩大侵略战争

    艾奇逊克拉克发表荒谬声明
    妄图推卸美方破坏停战谈判罪责
    我方合理新建议竟遭拒绝证明美方蓄意扩大侵略战争
    【新华社开城十日电】就在哈利逊宣布无限期中止停战谈判的同一天，东京的克拉克和华盛顿的艾奇逊立刻同时发表了内容和哈利逊在谈判会议上的发言同样荒谬的声明，企图把破坏停战谈判的责任推给朝中方面。这些早就准备好了的声明，说明美方事先就已经决定要在十月八日的会议上关闭谈判之门。
    但是出乎美方预料，南日将军在八日的会议上提出了一项公平合理的、采纳了美方意见的新建议。当时美方就蛮横地完全拒绝注意朝中方面的新建议，并慌忙地无理地不等我方发言，就擅自退出会场，从而达到使停战谈判中止的目的。但是美方知道，如果全世界人民——包括美国人民在内——知道了这个事实，他们就逃脱不了拒绝协商、蓄意破坏谈判的责任。因此他们现在绝口不谈南日将军的新建议，企图用这种卑劣的新闻封锁来欺骗全世界。例如，美方东京军中电台在九日广播说：“联军建议无限期休会，直至共方或者接受联军三项建议中的一项，或自己提出一项解决方案时为止。”克拉克也在他的声明中公开撒谎说：朝中方面“没有提出他们自己的建设性的建议”。但是这种欺骗手段是掩盖不了事实的真相的。全世界现在已经开始知道南日将军的新建议的内容了。事情很明显，既然是美方拒绝考虑朝中方面的新建议，提出无限期休会的要求，那末破坏停战谈判的责任不用说完全应由美方担负，这决不是一纸声明所能推卸得了的。
    艾奇逊在他的声明中承认，哈利逊在九月二十八日提出的三项建议，是换汤不换药的保持了所谓“不强迫遣返”原则的老一套办法。朝中方面早就一再声明，日内瓦公约的遣返全部战俘的原则是朝中方面信守的唯一原则。美方现在拿完全违背这个国际公认的原则的所谓“建议”来强迫朝中方面“任择其一”，这说明他们只是拿这些所谓“建议”来欺骗世界人民，并借此逃脱他们拖延谈判的责任，根本就不想解决问题。虽然艾奇逊和克拉克企图再度贩卖他们在他们的宣传市场上早就臭名远扬的破烂货色，把被他们强迫扣留的战俘说成是“至死抗拒”遣返的战俘，但是在美方战俘营中发生的一连串屠杀战俘事件，已经完全戳穿了这个鬼话。十月一日济州岛上的屠杀事件，说明被美方称为“反共合作”的中国人民志愿军战俘，实际上完全是热爱祖国，坚决要求遣返的。在这些血腥事实的对照之下，艾奇逊和克拉克嘴里的所谓“人道原则”和“个人权利”，就显得十分无耻。在美国侵略者看来，战俘只是可以被驱策来进行侵略战争的炮灰，而并不是应该予以人格尊重的人，如果他们要求任何个人权利，即使是庆祝祖国节日的权利，他们就要遭到杀戮。艾奇逊的所谓“美国与联合国的基本原则”，克拉克的所谓“基本理想”，就是把战俘送给李承晚、蒋介石匪帮，以便“最有效地利用他们”进行侵略战争。美国新闻处在十月一日公然下流已极地报道说：美国国防部官员指出，“在将来的战争中”，假如一万六千名所谓“不愿被遣返”的中国人民志愿军战俘获得所谓“自由”，
    “即将对盟国有很大的好处”。为了追求这种“好处”，两万七千名战俘已经被美方片面移交给了李承晚匪帮，一万一千名战俘正在被移交。这就是美方所谓“理想”的具体实现。
    在干了这一切无法无天的罪行以后，克拉克现在居然来令人欲呕地大谈其什么“人权”了。但是事实证明，美国侵略者根本不懂得什么是人权。他们对朝鲜和平城镇和平居民使用汽油弹、细菌武器等等大规模屠杀武器，企图剥夺朝鲜人民的生存权利；他们大规模屠杀要求遣返的战俘，企图剥夺战俘的回家过和平生活的权利；他们在美国国内屠杀和虐待有色人民，厉行种族歧视，并镇压为和平而斗争的人民，企图剥夺美国人民的民主权利；他们在全世界建立军事基地，把他们的军队派到外国去横行霸道，企图剥夺这些国家的人民的独立自主的权利。在这些横暴地蹂躏人权的匪徒看来，一切庄严的国际条约只是一张废纸，他们可以任意撕毁。他们是一群嗜血成性的野兽，在他们身上已经丧失了人类的良知。他们所有的只是用无辜人民的鲜血来替自己换取更多美元的独夫的狠毒欲望罢了！
    艾奇逊和克拉克在他们的声明中最后一再安慰他们的仆从国家说，美方中止停战谈判“并不等于对停战丧失了希望”。这显然是为了平息这些仆从国家的不满，以便将来把它们拖入更大的冒险。事实上，美方已经用中止停战谈判斩断了这些仆从国家的后路，迫使它们面临这样一个事实，就是停战谈判已经停止，战争仍在继续进行。这样，美国侵略者就可以逼着它们在即将举行的联合国大会上同意美国的侵略政策，并鞭策他们拿出更多的人和钱来替华尔街在更大规模的战争中火中取栗。合众社在八日就报道说，在联合国里，大多数人都以为“停止谈判给在下周召开的联合国大会会议上全面讨论朝鲜战争的政治问题打开了大门。”十月三日“华尔街日报”透露“美国将促使联合国大会通过强硬的决议来告诉共方说，他们应该接受最近提出的停战建议”。该报还说：如果美方的要求遭到拒绝，美国的“决策者和五角大楼人士已经在准备更猛烈的报复计划来对付北朝鲜和共产党中国”。美国的报纸和通讯社很久以来就叫嚷着要仆从国家“更多地承担朝鲜战争的负担”了。
    事实已经完全证明：美方蓄意用破坏朝鲜停战谈判，扩大战争来威胁全世界，而朝中方面则已经表现了坚持在国际公认的遣俘原则上继续进行谈判的坚定主张。美方的任何破坏手段和威胁恐吓，丝毫不能动摇朝中方面坚持原则、坚持协商谈判的意志。美方的无耻行为，已经受到全世界的谴责和反对，并将使全世界爱好和平的人民更广泛地动员起来，为击败美国侵略者的阴谋，为拯救和平而斗争。
