Xinhua News Agency, 27th. Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, telegraphed the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Pearson, on the 27th regarding the inclusion of the U.S. government's so-called proposal to investigate allegations of U.S. bacteriological warfare on the agenda of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The telegram reads as follows:

Mr. Pearson, President of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, New York:

On October 21st, under the coercion of the U.S. government representative, the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly included the U.S. government's so-called proposal to investigate allegations of U.S. bacteriological warfare on the agenda, and at the same time rejected the reasonable suggestion made by the Soviet representative to invite the parties concerned—the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—to attend and participate in the discussion.

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China hereby authorizes me to protest the United Nations' unilateral decision to include the so-called proposal to investigate allegations of U.S. bacteriological warfare on the agenda without inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion, and its rejection of the reasonable suggestion made by the Soviet representative, and to submit the following request to the United Nations General Assembly:

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the Chinese people, as the direct target and direct victim of bacteriological warfare conducted by U.S. interventionists, have the right and the necessity to send representatives to attend this session of the United Nations General Assembly and participate in the discussion of the so-called proposal to investigate allegations of U.S bacteriological warfare. The United Nations Seventh General Assembly should immediately invite the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to send representatives to attend this session of the General Assembly, present a report to the General Assembly on U.S. bacteriological warfare in China, and provide full evidence of this fact.

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China solemnly declares that without the participation of representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, any discussion and decision of the General Assembly regarding the so-called proposal to investigate allegations of U.S. bacteriological warfare will be illegal and therefore invalid.

I hereby submit this to you and request that Mr. President forward this telegram to all member states of the United Nations.

Zhou Enlai
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China

    周恩来外长电联合国大会
    抗议片面将调查指控细菌战提案列入议程
    要求邀请我代表出席报告美国细菌战罪行
    【新华社二十七日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来在二十七日就联合国第七届大会将美国政府提出的所谓调查指控美国进行细菌战的提案列入议程一事致电联合国大会主席皮尔逊。电文如下：纽约联合国第七届大会主席皮尔逊先生：
    十月二十一日联合国第七届大会在美国政府代表强制之下，将美国政府提出的所谓调查指控美国进行细菌战的提案列入议程，同时拒绝了苏联代表所提出的邀请当事国——中华人民共和国及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国出席参加讨论的合理建议。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府兹特授权本人，对于联合国未经邀请中华人民共和国的代表参加讨论，而片面决定将所谓调查指控美国进行细菌战的提案列入议程，并否决了苏联代表所提出的合理建议的行为，表示抗议，并向联合国大会提出如下要求：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，中国人民以美国干涉者进行细菌战的直接对象和直接受害者的资格，有权并有必要派遣代表出席本届联合国大会，参加关于所谓调查指控美国进行细菌战提案的讨论。联合国第七届大会应立即邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府派遣代表出席本届大会，向大会提出关于美国在中国进行细菌战的报告，并提供关于这一事实的充分证据。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府郑重声明：没有中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表参加，大会任何关于所谓调查指控美国进行细菌战的讨论和决定都将是非法的，因而是无效的。
    专此奉达，并请主席先生将这一电报转知联合国全体会员国为盼。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长  周恩来  一九五二年十月二十七日  北京
