Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 28th: The United Nations General Assembly, in its plenary meeting on October 25th, adopted the report of the Credentials Committee, which included two recommendations initially put forward by the United States: to recognize the credentials of the Kuomintang clique and to not consider any proposals requesting to allow representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations during this session of the General Assembly. The General Assembly's "voting machine" rejected the Soviet proposal to deny the credentials of the Kuomintang representatives.

At the beginning of the discussion, Belorussian representative Kiselev, supported by representatives from Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, and Burma, requested the adoption of the Soviet proposal. During the discussion, Polish representative Naszkowski said that "the remnant group of Kuomintang soldiers" had established a "mercenary army in Taiwan with the funding of the Pentagon," and the United States intended to use this army as a tool for its aggression in Asia.

U.S. representative Gross requested the adoption of the Credentials Committee's recommendation. The British representative said that he could not agree with the recommendation to recognize the Kuomintang's credentials and, therefore, requested the General Assembly to vote separately on the Credentials Committee's two recommendations. However, he also believed that it was too early to hold any vote on the issue of Chinese representation at the present time.

The Israeli representative opposed the recommendation not to consider the issue of the representation of the People's Republic of China, saying that the General Assembly could not avoid discussing this issue again during this session of the General Assembly.

The General Assembly subsequently adopted the entire report of the Credentials Committee, with 42 votes in favor. The Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Burma, and Sweden voted against it, and Afghanistan, Bolivia, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Israel, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, and Yugoslavia abstained.

Soviet representative Zorin immediately requested a vote on the Soviet proposal, but at the suggestion of U.S. representative Gross, the General Assembly decided not to vote on the Soviet proposal with 45 votes in favor, 6 votes against, and 4 abstentions.

The General Assembly then elected Colombia, Lebanon, and Denmark as members of the Security Council, replacing Brazil, the Netherlands, and Turkey, whose terms will expire at the end of this year.

The General Assembly then elected six members of the Economic and Social Council to replace the following six countries: Canada, Czechoslovakia, Iran, Mexico, Pakistan, and the United States. The terms of these six countries will expire at the end of this year.

Before the vote, the Chairman reminded the representatives that members of the Economic and Social Council whose terms were expiring could still be elected in this election. Venezuela, Australia, the United States, India, and Turkey were elected in the first round of voting. The sixth member of the Economic and Social Council was not elected because, after several rounds of voting, no candidate country (Czechoslovakia, Pakistan, Yugoslavia) obtained the necessary two-thirds majority vote to be elected.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 28th: The United Nations General Assembly continued to elect members of the Economic and Social Council at its plenary meeting on October 27th. In addition to the ten votes held at the meeting on October 25th, the General Assembly held three more votes today. After the thirteenth vote, under the pressure of the U.S.-British bloc, the representative of Tito's Yugoslavia was elected as a member of the Economic and Social Council. One-third of the representatives voted for the representative of Czechoslovakia.

Subsequently, two new members of the Trusteeship Council were elected to replace Iraq and El Salvador, whose terms will expire at the end of this year. The new member of the Trusteeship Council elected by the General Assembly was Syria, and El Salvador was re-elected.

The General Assembly decided to study the Security Council's annual report without any discussion.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 24th: The Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a brief meeting on the morning of October 23rd. The meeting has been adjourned until October 27th because no representative was prepared to speak on the first item on the agenda - the Palestinian refugee issue.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 28th: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Hickerson openly extorted "manpower and lives" from other countries of the United Nations so that the U.S. government could continue its war of aggression against Korea.

Hickerson made this demand in a speech on United Nations Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on the 24th. Hickerson admitted that the American people were already feeling "impatience and disappointment" with the war of aggression against Korea, but Hickerson said: "The only realistic way before us is to persevere in Korea, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy and minimizing our losses as much as possible."

Hickerson indicated that if the Korean and Chinese side did not accept the U.S. side's plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war, the war would have to continue. Hickerson demanded more military aid from other member states of the United Nations in order to achieve the U.S. government's goal of continuing the war of aggression while reducing U.S. military losses. Hickerson said: "There should be more troops in Korea at present, so that they can be prepared to continue fighting during the necessary period, and we will do our best in the General Assembly to urge the member states that have not sent troops to Korea to fulfill their responsibilities in Korea." Hickerson openly extorted "manpower and lives" from other member states of the United Nations to serve as cannon fodder for the U.S. war of aggression. He said that these countries "must be prepared to share an appropriate proportion of the sacrifices and risks, and each country must make the most valuable contribution it can - manpower and lives."

Hickerson's speech, which once again made extortionate demands, was clearly made to coordinate with Acheson's speech in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. The speeches of both of these people show that what the U.S. government is now pursuing is by no means peace in Korea, but the continuation and intensification of the war in Korea.

    联合国大会二十五日全体会议上
    苏联代表力主否认国民党代表的证书
    美助理国务卿希克逊公开向其他国家勒索侵朝炮灰
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会十月二十五日的全体会议通过了全权证书委员会的报告，这个报告包括最初由美国提出的两项建议：承认国民党集团的代表权和在本届大会期间对要求准许中华人民共和国代表参加联合国的各项建议不作任何考虑。大会的“表决机器”否决了苏联提出的否认国民党代表的证书的建议。
    在开始讨论时，白俄罗斯代表基塞列夫在波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度和缅甸等国代表的支持下要求通过苏联的提案。在讨论中，波兰代表纳斯科夫斯基说：“国民党军人的残余集团”在“五角大楼的资助下在台湾建立了一支雇佣军”，美国打算用这支军队作它侵略亚洲的工具。
    美国代表葛罗斯要求通过全权证书委员会的建议。英国代表说：他不能同意承认国民党的证书的建议，因此，他要求大会对全权证书委员会的两项建议分别举行投票。但是他又认为在目前情况下就中国代表权问题举行任何投票为时尚早。
    以色列代表反对不考虑中华人民共和国代表权问题的建议，他说，大会不能不在本届大会期间再次讨论这个问题。
    大会随后通过了全权证书委员会的全部报告，投票结果有四十二票赞成。苏联、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、缅甸和瑞典等国投反对票，阿富汗、玻利维亚、危地马拉、印度、印度尼西亚、以色列、巴基斯坦、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、也门和南斯拉夫等十一国弃权。
    苏联代表佐林随即要求投票表决苏联的提案，但在美国代表葛罗斯的建议下，大会以四十五票赞成、六票反对、四票弃权，决定对苏联的建议不予表决。
    大会随后选出哥伦比亚、黎巴嫩和丹麦为安全理事会的理事国，以代替巴西、荷兰和土耳其三国，后三国的任期将于今年年底届满。
    大会随后又选举经济暨社会理事会的六个理事，以代替下列的六个国家：加拿大、捷克斯洛伐克、伊朗、墨西哥、巴基斯坦和美国。这六国的任期将于今年年底届满。
    在举行投票之前，主席提醒代表说，经济暨社会理事会任期将满的理事国，仍可在这次选举中当选。委内瑞拉、澳大利亚、美国、印度和土耳其在第一次投票中当选。经济暨社会理事会的第六个理事国没有选出，因为经过几次投票，没有一个候选国（捷克斯洛伐克、巴基斯坦、南斯拉夫）获得当选必需的三分之二多数票。
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会十月二十七日的全体会议上继续选举经济暨社会理事会的理事。大会除在十月二十五日的会议上举行的十次投票以外，今天又举行了三次投票。到第十三次投票以后，在美英集团的压力下才把铁托的南斯拉夫的代表选为经济暨社会理事会的理事。有三分之一的代表投票选举捷克斯洛伐克的代表。
    随后又选出了两名托管理事会的新理事，以代替伊拉克和萨尔瓦多两国，这两国的任期将于本年年底届满。大会选出的托管理事会的新理事是叙利亚，萨尔瓦多重新当选。
    大会没有经过任何讨论便决定研究安全理事会的本年度报告。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十四日电：联合国大会特别政治委员会于十月二十三日上午举行了一次简短的会议。会议已决定延期到十月二十七日再开，因为没有一个代表准备就议程中第一项——巴勒斯坦难民问题发言。
    【新华社开城二十八日电】美国助理国务卿希克逊公开向联合国其他国家勒索“人力与生命”，以便美国政府继续进行侵朝战争。
    希克逊是在二十四日在美国威斯康星州密尔窝基发表联合国日的演说时提出这个要求的。希克逊承认，美国人民对于侵略朝鲜的战争已经感到“不耐与失望”，但是希克逊说：“摆在我们面前唯一现实的办法就是在朝鲜坚持下去，给予敌人以沉重的损失，使我们的损失尽可能减少。”
    希克逊表示，如果朝中方面不肯接受美方的强迫扣留战俘的方案，战争就还要继续下去。希克逊要求联合国其他会员国拿出更多军事援助，以达到美国政府的既要继续侵略战争、又要减少美军损失的目的。希克逊说：“目前在朝鲜应该有更多的军队，以便在必要的期间内能准备继续作战，我们要在大会中尽力争取没有派军队到朝鲜去的各会员国履行其在朝鲜的责任。”希克逊公开向联合国其他会员国勒索“人力与生命”，来充当美国侵略战争的炮灰。他说，这些国家“必须准备分担适当比例的牺牲与危险，每一国家必须作其力所能及的最有价值的贡献——人力与生命。”
    希克逊这篇再次提出勒索要求的演说，显然是为了配合艾奇逊在联合国大会政治委员会中的演说而发表的。这两个人的演说，都表明美国政府现在所追求的决不是朝鲜的和平，而是继续和加强在朝鲜的战争。
