Resolution on Women's Rights and Children's Welfare

    Today, in many countries around the world, women and children are suffering from hunger and death and are paying a terrible price because of the inhuman acts of those who wage wars of aggression. Currently, the majority of people killed in the aggressive wars in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya and other countries are women and children. We, the representatives gathered in Beijing to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, driven by conscience, want to make the world aware of the suffering of women in this region and their heroic actions in the struggle for peace.

    Women are the givers of life; they are the enemies of war. They account for more than half of humanity, and they are a powerful force in the struggle of all people to defend peace and fight for national independence. Children are the creators of the future.

    We are deeply proud of the burning desire for a completely independent life shown by those people who are currently being massacred in large numbers and are suffering the pain of war on their own soil. From the great heroic deeds, the glorious achievements of labor, and the indomitable courage of women, especially Korean women, we are inspired.

    The future belongs to them.

    We are deeply proud of the courage and tenacity shown in the face of persecution and oppression by the people of countries burdened by the heavy burden of war preparations and suffering from hunger and poverty. Their governments are driving them to participate in aggressive wars that kill their fellow human beings. We are proud that they are determined to defend the material and spiritual welfare of women and children, shielding them from the suffering caused by the policies of war.

    Their struggle will never fail.

    We are deeply proud of the people of those countries who have already achieved brilliant successes, where conditions of freedom and independence have unleashed unlimited potential for creative peaceful life; where women and children have won complete equality, security and peace.

    They are our hope.

    We firmly believe that the time has come for the people of the world to clearly express their common will to achieve the following:

    — To resolve all international disputes justly and peacefully.

    — To use the vast resources of the world to improve the welfare of all the world's people.

    — To allow all people the freedom to enjoy equal opportunities, and all women to enjoy equal status.

    We call on the women of all countries to unite closely and support the struggle of women in the Asian and Pacific regions for peace and full equality.

    We call on all peace-loving women in all countries of the Asian and Pacific regions, regardless of nationality, language, religion or political belief and social status, to unite as one and take measures appropriate to the specific conditions of each country to work for world peace.

    We call on all women to strengthen their organizations for peace, establish organizations to protect children, and maintain close contact.

    We call on women's organizations to organize more women in cities and villages, so that women from the widest possible strata can understand the significance of this great struggle and unite them more closely around the common goal of women in all countries of the world – the goal of winning a just and lasting peace.

    On behalf of all women as givers of life, and all children as builders of the future, we make the following demands:

    We demand an end to the war of aggression in Korea and the achievement of a fair settlement. We demand an end to the wars in Vietnam, Malaya and other countries, and the withdrawal of foreign troops from those countries.

    We demand that atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction be declared illegal, and that war propaganda be banned.

    We demand that governments divert war funds to essential social welfare programs, such as the health, material and spiritual welfare of women and children.

    We demand that governments guarantee and improve the political, economic, educational and social rights of all women.

    We demand that governments abolish all laws that discriminate against women and children, and create the necessary conditions to ensure that they obtain complete equality, happiness and peace.

                            Beijing, October 12, 1952

    关于妇女权利与儿童福利的决议
    今天世界上有许多国家的妇女和儿童正在遭受着饥饿与死亡，并由于制造侵略战争者的非人道行为，正在付出可怕的代价。目前在朝鲜、越南、马来亚等国的侵略战争中被杀害的人民大半是妇女和儿童。我们聚集在北京参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表们，受着良心的驱使，要使全世界知道这个区域妇女的痛苦和她们为和平斗争的英勇行为。
    妇女是生命的给予者；她们是战争的敌人。她们占人类半数以上，在全体人民为保卫和平与争取民族独立的斗争中，她们是一支强大的力量。儿童是未来的创造者。
    我们深感自豪，那些目前被大量屠杀，并正在自己的国土上遭受战争痛苦的人民，对完全独立的生活表现出灼热的愿望。从妇女们，尤其是朝鲜妇女们的伟大的英雄事迹、劳动的辉煌成就和不屈不挠的勇气，我们得到了鼓舞。
    未来是属于他们的。
    我们深感自豪，那些受到备战的沉重负担，遭受饥饿和贫困的国家的人民，在迫害和压迫面前表现了勇敢和坚韧。他们的政府正驱使他们参加残杀同类的侵略战争。我们骄傲，他们决心保卫妇女和儿童的物质及精神福利，使他们免受战争政策所造成的痛苦。
    他们的斗争决不会失败。
    我们深感自豪，那些已经取得了辉煌成就的国家的人民，在他们那里，自由和独立的条件已经为创造性的和平生活发挥了无限的潜力；在他们那里，妇女和儿童已经赢得了完全的平等、安全与和平。
    他们是我们的希望。
    我们深信，时间已经到了，全世界人民应当明确表示他们的共同意志，以实现下列各点：
    ——公正地和平地解决一切国际纠纷。
    ——利用全世界的广大的资源以增进全世界人民的福利。
    ——使一切人民有享受同等机会的自由，一切妇女享受平等地位。
    我们号召各国妇女紧密团结，支持亚洲及太平洋区域妇女争取和平和完全平等的斗争。
    我们号召亚洲及太平洋区域各国一切爱好和平的妇女，不分民族、语言、宗教或政治信仰及社会地位，一致团结起来，采取适合各国具体情况的措施，为世界和平而努力。
    我们号召一切妇女加强她们的争取和平的组织，建立保卫儿童的组织，并保持密切联系。
    我们号召妇女组织，在城市与乡村组织更多的妇女，使尽量广泛的各阶层的妇女了解这个伟大斗争的意义，把她们更紧密地团结在全世界各国妇女的共同目标的周围——这个目标就是赢得正义的与持久的和平。
    我们代表作为生命给予者的一切妇女，和作为未来建设者的一切儿童，提出下列要求：
    我们要求停止侵略朝鲜的战争并实现公平解决。我们要求制止越南、马来亚及其他国家的战争，并撤退那些国家中的外国军队。
    我们要求把原子武器、细菌武器及其他大量屠杀的武器宣布为非法，并禁止战争宣传。
    我们要求各国政府把战争款项，改用在必需的社会福利事业上，如：妇女儿童的卫生、物质和精神的福利事业。
    我们要求各国政府保证并提高一切妇女的政治的、经济的、教育的和社会的权利。
    我们要求各国政府废除一切歧视妇女儿童的法律，并创造必要的条件以保证他们得到完全的平等、幸福与和平。
                            一九五二年十月十二日于北京
