    The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has concluded. This congress has enormous international significance. It is especially significant for the people of our country, who are resisting America and aiding Korea and are about to enter into large-scale economic and cultural construction.

    The congress discussed and approved the political line and practical work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks); adopted the directives of the 19th Party Congress on the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union (Fifth Five-Year Plan) for 1951-1955; adopted the resolution on the revision of the program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the resolution on changing the name of the party, and the resolution on the revision of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; and elected new central organs. Before the closing session, Comrade Stalin, amidst the enthusiastic cheers of all the delegates and leaders of communist and workers' parties from various countries, delivered his speech of world-historical significance.

    Comrade Stalin's speech and Comrade Malenkov's report, with extremely convincing arguments, explained the two situations and two futures of the world's two camps—the imperialist camp and the peaceful democratic camp; explained the incomparable superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system; and pointed out the path for the Soviet Union to move towards communism and for the people of capitalist countries to strive for complete victory in their liberation struggles.

    Since 1929, despite the severe Patriotic War, the Soviet Union's industrial production has increased thirteenfold; the industrial production of capitalist countries, even with the stimulus of expanding armaments, has stagnated at its original level. The United States, completely unaffected by the war, has only seen its industrial production double. The countries of the world democratic camp, led by the Soviet Union, already have a population of 800 million, accounting for one-third of the world's population, are politically united, economically thriving, and have a steadily improving standard of living. They have formed a world market of peaceful democratic countries that opposes the world market of the imperialist aggressive camp, and its development is not threatened by economic crises. The world imperialist camp, led by the United States, has been greatly weakened, is politically disunited, and the contradictions between countries, especially the contradictions between the United States and Britain, are intensifying. The imperialist world market is shrinking, economic crises are inevitable, wars between imperialist countries are also inevitable, and the people are in poverty, unemployment, famine, and the threat of war. The Soviet Union is moving towards communism with full confidence. As Comrade Malenkov said: "We have all the necessary conditions to build a complete communist society. The natural wealth of the Soviet state is inexhaustible. Our country has shown its ability to use this enormous wealth for the benefit of the working people. The Soviet people have shown their ability to build a new society, and they look forward to the future with full confidence." The other countries of the world peaceful democratic camp, with the kind help of the Soviet Union, are also building socialist and new democratic societies. And "the bourgeoisie—the main enemy of the liberation movement—is different from before, it has changed greatly, it has become more reactionary, it has lost contact with the people, and has thus weakened itself." (Stalin) In capitalist countries, the bourgeoisie has no shadow of liberalism, no shadow of "national principles"; the banners of democracy, freedom, and national independence will no longer be raised by anyone except communist and democratic parties.

    The flourishing development of the world peaceful democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, and the disintegration and unpopularity of the imperialist aggressive camp led by the United States, are fundamentally explained in Comrade Stalin's recent work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." Comrade Malenkov elaborated on Comrade Stalin's argument:

    "Comrade Stalin proved that the main features and requirements of the basic law of modern capitalism are: 'to secure the maximum of capitalist profit through the exploitation, ruin and impoverishment of the majority of the population of the given country, through the enslavement and systematic robbery of the peoples of other countries, especially backward countries, and, lastly, through wars and militarization of the national economy, which are utilized for the obtaining of the highest profits.' ('Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR') This law exposes and explains the striking contradictions of capitalism, and completely exposes the roots of the aggressive and predatory policies of capitalist countries. The operation of this law leads to the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, and inevitably causes the maturity and outbreak of all contradictions in capitalist society.

    "In stark contrast to decaying capitalism is the rising, prosperous socialist system. The main features and conditions of the basic economic law of socialism discovered by Comrade Stalin are: 'the securing of the maximum satisfaction of the constantly rising material and cultural requirements of the whole of society through the continuous expansion and perfection of socialist production on the basis of higher techniques.' (Ibid.) Comrade Stalin has explained that the purpose of the socialist mode of production is not for profit, but for man and his needs, for satisfying his material and cultural needs. Ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the ever-increasing material and cultural needs of the whole society is the purpose of socialist production, while the continuous expansion and perfection of socialist production on the basis of the highest technology is the means to achieve this purpose. The operation of this law will lead to the surge of social productive forces, the prosperity of society, and the continuous improvement of the material welfare and cultural level of the working people."

    What lies before the Chinese people is the task of carrying out large-scale economic and cultural construction. For this purpose, we have another task, which is the task of opposing war and defending peace. According to the various reports and discussions at the 19th Congress of the CPSU, it makes us clearer: as long as we strive to strengthen our national defense forces, strive for victory in resisting America and aiding Korea, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and unite international friends, we will surely win peace. Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the CPSU provides us with extremely important and rich experiences in economic construction, cultural construction, political power construction, and party construction, which we can and should correctly apply according to the specific circumstances of our country.

    The spirit that fills the documents of the 19th Congress of the CPSU is the confidence in the victory of building communism, and the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Comrade Malenkov's report should become a document that comrades working in various positions study carefully, in order to improve our work and achieve greater success in our various tasks.

    For the success of future construction, and for opposing aggressive wars and defending international peace, the people of our country must strive to learn from the Soviet Union and strive to consolidate and strengthen our friendly alliance with the Soviet Union.

    Comrade Stalin said: "After our party seized power in 1917, and after our party took practical measures to eliminate the oppression of capitalists and landlords, representatives of fraternal parties expressed their admiration for the courage and success of our party, and gave our party the title of 'shock brigade' of the world revolutionary workers' movement. They used this to express their hope that the success of this 'shock brigade' would alleviate the suffering of the people of all countries groaning under capitalist oppression. I think our party has not failed this hope."

    We Chinese communists and the Chinese people know from our own personal experience what great help the socialist Soviet Union, led by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, has given to our revolution and construction.

    As early as the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, said: "In this world, all imperialists are our enemies. If China wants independence, it must not leave the assistance of socialist countries and the international proletariat. That is to say, it cannot leave the assistance of the Soviet Union, and it cannot leave the assistance of the proletariat of Japan, Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and other countries in carrying out anti-capitalist struggles in their own countries." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume II, page 651) In 1945, the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan finally won victory with the direct assistance of the Soviet Union.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said again in 1949: "Please think about it, if there were no existence of the Soviet Union, if there were no victory of the anti-fascist Second World War, if Japanese imperialism had not been defeated, if the new democratic countries had not emerged, if the oppressed nations of the East were not rising to struggle, if there were no struggles between the people of capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the reactionaries who rule them, if there were no combination of all this, then the international reactionary forces piled on our heads would surely be many times greater than they are now. In this situation, could we have won? Obviously not. If we had won, would it have been possible to consolidate it?" ("On the People's Democratic Dictatorship") Since then, the achievements of our country's various recovery work, transformation work, and construction endeavors, and the improvement of our country's international status, have all been achieved with the help of the Soviet Union and the help of the people of all countries in the world.

    Comrade Mao Zedong also said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is our best teacher, and we must learn from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union." The Chinese Communist Party was established by taking the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as an example. Our revolution was successful by correctly applying the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Our future construction undertakings will also be successful because we can learn from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    The achievements of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have greatly increased our confidence in the struggle for us Chinese communists and the Chinese people, and illuminated our path forward—the path from new democracy to socialism to communism, the path of uniting international friends to oppose war and uphold peace.

### 苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的国际意义

    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的国际意义
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会闭幕了。这次大会具有非常巨大的国际意义。对于正在抗美援朝并即将进入大规模经济建设与文化建设的我国人民，尤其有深刻的意义。
    代表大会讨论和批准了苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会的政治路线和实际工作；通过了第十九次党代表大会关于一九五一年——一九五五年苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示；通过了关于修改苏联共产党党纲的决议，关于更改党的名称的决议和关于修改苏联共产党党章的决议；选举了新的中央机构。在闭幕之前，斯大林同志在全体代表和各国共产党、工人党领袖的热烈欢呼中，发表了他的具有世界历史意义的演说。
    斯大林同志的演说，马林科夫同志的报告，都以极其令人信服的论据，说明了世界两大阵营——帝国主义阵营与和平民主阵营的两种情况，两种前途；说明了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的无可比拟的优越性；并且指出了苏联走向共产主义及资本主义各国人民争取解放的斗争达到完全胜利的道路。
    苏联从一九二九年以来，中间虽然经过严重的卫国战争，但工业生产已增加到十三倍；资本主义各国的工业生产，即使靠了扩张军备的刺激，仍然停滞在原来的水平，完全未受战争损害的美国，工业生产也仅仅增加到两倍。以苏联为首的世界民主阵营各国，已经有八万万人口，即占全世界人口的三分之一，政治上是团结的，经济上是蓬勃发展的，人民的生活水平是日益提高的，并且形成了与帝国主义侵略阵营的世界市场相对立的和平民主阵营国家的世界市场，它的发展不受经济危机的威胁。以美国为首的世界帝国主义阵营，已经大大削弱，政治上是不团结的，各国之间的矛盾首先是美英之间的矛盾正在尖锐化，帝国主义的世界市场日益缩小，经济危机不可避免，帝国主义国家之间的战争也不可避免，人民处于贫苦、失业、灾荒和战争威胁之中。苏联满怀信心地向共产主义前进，正如马林科夫同志所说：“我们有着建成一个完全的共产主义社会的一切必要条件。苏维埃国家的天然财富是取之不尽的。我们国家已表明它有能力利用这种巨大的财富来为劳动人民谋福利的。苏联人民已经显示了他们建设新社会的本领，他们满怀信心地展望着将来。”世界和平民主阵营的其他各国，在苏联的亲切帮助之下，亦正在建设着社会主义和新民主主义的社会。而“资产阶级——解放运动的主要敌人——已经和以前不同了，它已经大大地变了，已经变得更加反动了，它已经失去了和人民的联系，因而削弱了自己。”（斯大林）在资本主义国家中，资产阶级连一点点自由主义的影子也没有了，连一点点“民族原则”的影子也没有了；民主自由和民族独立的旗帜，除了共产主义和民主的政党以外，再没有人会举起它来了。
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营蒸蒸日上的发展，以美国为首的帝国主义侵略阵营的分崩离析，众叛亲离，其根本原因在斯大林同志的最近著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中作了精辟的论证。马林科夫同志阐述斯大林同志的这个论证说：
    “斯大林同志证明了：现代资本主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求是：‘用剥削本国大多数居民并使之破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家、特别是落后国家的人民的办法，最后用那些可以用来保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大的资本主义利润’（‘苏联社会主义经济问题’）这个法则揭露并说明了资本主义的惊人矛盾，而且把资本主义国家的侵略掠夺政策的根源完全揭露出来了。这个法则的作用导致资本主义总危机的加深，并且引起资本主义社会一切矛盾的必然成熟和爆发。
    “与腐朽的资本主义完全相反的是上升的、繁荣的社会主义制度。斯大林同志发现的社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和条件是：‘通过在优越的技术基础上进行的社会主义生产的不断发展和不断趋于完善，保证社会所有成员的不断增加的物质和文化要求得到最高限度的满足。’（同上）斯大林同志已经说明，社会主义生产方式的目的不是为了利润，而是为了人和他的需要，为了满足他的物质需要和文化需要。保证整个社会的不断增加的物质需要和文化需要得到最大限度的满足是社会主义生产的目的，而在最高的技术基础上进行的社会主义生产的不断的发展和趋于完善则是达到这个目的的手段。这种法则所发生的作用就要导向社会生产力的高涨，社会的繁荣以及劳动人民的物质福利和文化水平的不断提高。”
    放在中国人民面前的，是进行大规模的经济建设与文化建设的任务。为此目的，我们就有另一个任务，这就是反对战争、维护和平的任务。根据联共第十九次代表大会中的各项报告和讨论，使我们更加清楚地认识：只要我们努力加强国防力量，争取抗美援朝的胜利，巩固人民民主专政，团结国际友人，就一定可以赢得和平。马林科夫同志在联共第十九次代表大会上的报告，在经济建设、文化建设、政权建设和党的建设等方面，为我们提供了极其重要的、可以而且应该依照我国具体环境正确地运用的丰富的经验。
    充满在联共第十九次代表大会文件中的精神，就是对于建设共产主义的胜利的信心，和批评与自我批评的精神。马林科夫同志的报告，应该成为我们在各个岗位上工作的同志仔细学习的文件，以求得改善我们的工作，使我们的各项工作取得更大的成就。
    我国人民，为了今后建设事业的成功，为了反对侵略战争维护国际和平，必须努力向苏联学习，努力巩固与加强与苏联的友好同盟。
    斯大林同志说：“在一九一七年我们党取得政权以后，在我们党采取了实际措施消除了资本家和地主的压迫以后，兄弟党的代表们对我们党的勇敢和成功表示敬佩，给予我们党以世界革命工人运动‘突击队’的称号。他们以此表示他们希望这支‘突击队’的成功减轻在资本主义压迫下呻吟的各国人民的痛苦。我认为我们的党并没有辜负这种希望”。
    我们中国共产党员，中国人民，从自己的切身经验中知道苏联共产党所领导的社会主义苏联，给了我们的革命和建设事业以何等重大的帮助。
    早在抗日战争初期，我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志就说：“这个世界上，所有帝国主义都是我们的敌人，中国要独立，决不能离开社会主义国家和国际无产阶级的援助。这就是说，不能离开苏联的援助，不能离开日本和英、美、法、德、意各国无产阶级在其本国进行反资本主义斗争的援助。”（毛泽东选集第二卷第六五一页）一九四五年，中国人民的抗日战争终于在苏联的直接援助下获得了胜利。
    毛泽东同志在一九四九年又说：“请大家想一想，假如没有苏联的存在，假如没有反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利，假如没有打倒日本帝国主义，假如没有各新民主国家的出现，假如没有东方各被压迫民族正在起来斗争，假如没有美国、英国、法国、德国、意大利、日本等等资本主义国家内部的人民大众和统治他们的反动派之间的斗争，假如没有这一切的综合，那么，堆在我们头上的国际反动势力必定比现在不知要大多少倍，在这种情形下，我们能够胜利么？显然是不能的。胜利了，要巩固，也不可能。”（“论人民民主专政”）从那时以来，我国各项恢复工作，改造工作，和建设事业的成就，我国国际地位的提高，都是得到苏联的帮助，和世界各国人民的帮助的。
    毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”一书中还说：“联共就是我们的最好的先生，我们必须向联共学习。”中国共产党就是以苏联共产党为榜样而建立起来的。我们的革命是在正确地运用苏联共产党的经验中成功的。我们今后的建设事业，也将因为我们能向联共学习而得到成功。
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的成就，对我们中国共产党和中国人民来说，是大大地增加了我们的奋斗信心，照明了我们的前进道路——由新民主主义过渡到社会主义到共产主义的道路，团结国际友人以反对战争、拥护和平的道路。
