Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 23rd -- New York dispatch: William Z. Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, published an article in the "Daily Worker" on October 14th, entitled "Korean Prisoners of War and the United Nations General Assembly." Foster pointed out that the United States intends to play tricks at the United Nations General Assembly, demanding the continuation and expansion of the Korean War, which "puts the whole world in the face of a most dangerous prospect of war expansion." Foster called on the American people to work together to stop these conspiracies of the warmongers.

Foster said: "Wall Street's war instigators have made billions in profits from the reactionary Korean War, and they妄想 (dare to) squeeze more profits from a larger-scale war from the American and other peoples. These people shamelessly use the issue of prisoners of war to carry out their base plans. They violate international law, claiming that they have the right to arbitrarily decide which prisoners should or should not return to their homeland, first creating disputes in a barbaric way. Therefore, the responsibility for the stalemate in the issue of prisoners of war lies entirely with Washington and its puppets in the United Nations."

Foster emphasized: "What should be done in this critical situation is: immediately repatriate the prisoners of war to China and North Korea respectively, because China and North Korea make such demands based on international law and common sense. At the same time, there should be an immediate ceasefire in Korea according to the agreement reached by both sides. This is the fundamental issue that the American people must resolve in order to prevent the current dangerous world situation from further deteriorating and possibly turning into a full-scale war."

Foster concluded: "The American people are already extremely disgusted with the unlucky and reactionary Korean War. They have expressed this in many ways. The current United Nations General Assembly provides an opportunity to stop this unnecessary and useless massacre and ease world tensions. But to do this, the people, especially organized workers, must speak out loudly. They must let everyone know their desire for peace and ensure that these desires are respected."

Xinhua News Agency, 23rd -- TASS, New York dispatch: American peace advocates held a demonstration in front of the United Nations Building on the evening of the 21st, with about 5,000 people participating. The demonstrators demanded an immediate ceasefire in Korea. They held flags and signs with slogans such as: "Immediately stop the slaughter in Korea, continue negotiations." The demonstrators shouted peace slogans as they passed the United Nations Building. The demonstration was organized by the "New York Peace Association," which includes representatives from various labor unions, religious organizations, and other organizations.

    【新华社布拉格二十三日电】纽约消息：美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特在十月十四日的“工人日报”上发表文章，题为“朝鲜战俘和联合国大会”。福斯特指出：美国打算在联合国大会上玩弄花样，要求继续并扩大朝鲜战争，这“使得全世界面对着一个最危险的战争扩大的前途”。福斯特号召美国人民协力制止战争贩子的这些阴谋。
    福斯特说：“华尔街的战争挑拨者从反动的朝鲜战争中取得了亿万的利润，他们妄想从一个规模更大的战争中，在美国和其它人民身上榨取更多的利润，这些人厚颜无耻地利用战俘问题来进行他们的卑污计划。他们违背国际法，声称他们有权随意决定那一个俘虏应该或是不应该回到他们的祖国去，首先横蛮地制造了争执。因此，使得战俘问题产生僵局的责任，完全在华盛顿和它在联合国内的傀儡身上。”
    福斯特强调说：“在这种危急的情况下应该做的事情是：立刻把战俘分别遣回中国和北朝鲜，因为中国和北朝鲜以国际法和普通常识为根据作这样的要求。同时，应该根据双方已达成的协议，立刻在朝鲜停火。这就是美国人民为了要防止目前危险的世界局势进一步恶化并可能变成全面战争而必须解决的基本问题。”
    福斯特结语说：“美国人民对于倒运的和反动的朝鲜战争已经感到极为厌恶。他们在许多方面作了这样的表示。本届联合国大会提供了制止这一不必要的和无用的屠杀以及缓和世界紧张局势的机会。但是要做到这一点，人民，尤其是有组织的工人，必须大声疾呼。他们必须让大家知道他们的和平愿望，并使这些愿望得到尊重。”
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：美国和平拥护者二十一日晚在联合国大厦前举行示威游行，参加的约有五千人。游行者要求在朝鲜立即停火。他们举着旗帜和标语牌，上面写着：“立即停止在朝鲜的屠杀，继续谈判。”游行者走过联合国大厦时，高呼和平的口号。这次的游行是由“纽约和平协会”主持的，参加这一协会的有各种工会、宗教及其他组织的代表。
