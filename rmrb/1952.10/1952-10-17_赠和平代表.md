    To the Peace Delegates
    You have denounced the witch who is accustomed to sowing discord. You have denounced the villain who arranges military bases everywhere. You have denounced the thug who worships atomic weapons. You have denounced the robber who believes in germ warfare. Your accusations summarize the understanding of our 1.6 billion people (and more than just our 1.6 billion people!). We are even clearer about who the enemy is. You have shown the completely selfless love of humanity. You fervently embrace those whom the reactionaries consider deadly enemies. You make brothers who have been estranged by slander swear never to quarrel again. You have shown your determination to create a better life. You say that to welcome youth, we must protect mothers and children. You say that to nourish body and mind, we must exchange economy and culture. Your expressions summarize the desires of our 1.6 billion people (and more than just our 1.6 billion people!). Our hearts are all the same. You have made it clear that peace will not fall to the ground like an apple, nor will it fly in on its own like a magpie flapping its wings. You have made it clear that peace must be fought for, just as Michurin said: "We cannot wait for the gifts of 'nature.' We must wrest things from 'nature.'" Your explanations have increased the courage of our 1.6 billion people (and more than just our 1.6 billion people!). We must work together with one heart!

    赠和平代表
    叶圣陶你们控诉了惯搞挑拨离间的巫婆。你们控诉了到处安排军事基地的恶棍。你们控诉了崇拜原子武器的暴徒。你们控诉了迷信细菌战争的强盗。你们的控诉归纳了咱们十六亿人的认识，（何止咱们十六亿人的呢？）咱们更清楚谁是敌人。你们表现了完全无私的人类的友爱，反动派认作死对头的，你们跟他们热烈拥抱，你们让谗言离间了的亲弟兄，现在发誓再不阋墙。你们表现了创造美好生活的决心，你们说迎接青春必须保卫母亲和孩子，你们说营养身心必须交流经济和文化。你们的表现综合了咱们十六亿人的愿望，（何止咱们十六亿人的呢？）咱们的心全都一个样。你们阐明了和平不会像苹果一样自个儿落在地上，也不会像喜鹊一样自个儿拍着翅膀飞来。你们阐明了和平必须争取才能到手，正像米丘林说的——“我们不能等待‘自然’的恩赐，“我们必须向‘自然’争取东西。”你们的阐明增长了咱们十六亿人的勇气，（何止咱们十六亿人的呢？）咱们得同心协力的干！
