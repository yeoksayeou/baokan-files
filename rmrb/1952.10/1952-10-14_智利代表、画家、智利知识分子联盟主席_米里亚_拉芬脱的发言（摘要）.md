    Chilean Representative, Painter, and President of the Chilean Intellectuals' Alliance
    Mirian Lafent's Speech (Summary)

    I, on behalf of the Chilean Intellectuals' Alliance and the people's artists, extend my warm greetings to this historic conference.

    The Chilean Intellectuals' Alliance was founded by Pablo Neruda during the Spanish Civil War to defend our culture from fascist infringement and to resist any trends that undermine human dignity and social progress. Now, this alliance is promoting and participating in the peace movement, because only in a peaceful environment can humanity fully develop forward.

    The majority of Chilean artists and intellectuals have already participated in the struggle of the world's people to defend peace and the struggle of oppressed people worldwide.

    Chile is an economically backward country, and the living standards of workers and general staff are terribly low. However, despite such poverty, Chilean writers and artists have not sold their souls or compromised on matters of principle.

    Thanks to the unity between the people and the artists, we can see a shift in our activities in Chile, that is, a new realism is rapidly developing towards the standard that art must cooperate with the national independence movement and serve peace.

    Chile has abundant natural resources. The Chilean soil is rich in extremely important industrial mineral deposits. Chile has always been known for its production of nitrate and copper. We also produce iron, coal, and manganese. These are our main resources. However, these resources have so far been our misfortune, because imperialism paid attention to it from the very beginning: first attention, and then it robbed it with hands and guns.

    First, in the early nineteenth century, British imperialism, and then the Americans, used their dollars to seize copper and iron mines, taking whatever they could get their hands on. From that time on, our motherland was sold out day by day. Foreign pressure is becoming more and more open and barbaric. In the past few years, new nitrate deposits have also been plundered by imperialism. The monopoly of our copper mines is becoming more and more severe. Our oil fields, which until recently were almost completely unexploited, are now controlled by world trusts. The recently discovered uranium mines have become the subject of negotiations between the Chilean government and the American ambassador.

    Imperialism has done everything possible in the cultural field to put our culture in an extremely dangerous situation. The purpose of imperialism is to weaken us and deprive us of what we still retain intact—national consciousness; this national consciousness is what we all know, although our country is a very small country, we occupy a valuable position in the international family, we know that our country can produce great poets, historians, and great creators in various fields of thought and work who are completely Chilean, and can give the world's cultural treasure a very precious contribution. Imperialists want to make us cosmopolitan. They want us to abandon our own problems.

    We affirm that all the values created by mankind are universal. We affirm that Thomas Mann, Sanín Cano, Hikmet, Jorge Amado, Guo Moruo, or Ehrenburg all have their universality, but we can never recognize the kind of universality that sacrifices the nation. At the same time, we also affirm the kind of universality that is in harmony with the special traditions of various countries, the kind of universality that can make a Chilean poet like Pablo Neruda, who has won the World Peace Prize, cherished and loved by the people of the world, the kind of universality that enables us to deeply understand the essence of England in Shakespeare's works and understand the true essence of France in Laperre's works.

    But imperialism is not interested in this kind of universality that takes national character as the first priority. The universality that imperialism wants is the kind of universality that can make a Chilean forget that he is still a Chilean in the final analysis. Imperialism's demand on our culture is that it should not reflect our independence and our urgent demands for liberation.

    Imperialism used all available means to achieve this goal. It uses scholarships to lure young intellectuals. It fills our film industry with war-mongering or disgusting shallow films. It provides us with a large number of books and periodicals of the same nature, and conducts crazy publicity for these books and periodicals. It monopolizes our book industry, and our market serves as a pocket-sized detective novel that praises evil and robbery. It promotes the worship of the so-called North American racial superiority, tries its best to portray the North American aggressors in Korea as legendary figures, and tries its best to create isolation and division. It attempts to undermine all possibilities of establishing cultural ties with other countries, including South American countries.

    All this brings fatal danger to our national culture. This problem also affects all Latin American countries.

    Recently, Mistral, together with Sanín Cano and Joaquín García Monge, issued an appeal to the intellectuals of the Americas, calling on them to meet and discuss issues related to themselves and the people of the Americas. The countries of the Americas have decided to hold this conference in Santiago, Chile, at the beginning of next year.

    Chilean intellectuals have participated in all the struggles of their people. In words and deeds, they have been with those organizations that are fighting for peace and progress on this or that front, these fronts are either against signing military pacts or educational agreements with the United States, or demanding the restoration of civil rights or maintaining relations with all countries in the world. When necessary, intellectuals also take to the streets. They unite around trade unions and all those organizations that call on them to participate in actions, because the people's struggle is their own struggle.

    The Chilean Intellectuals' Alliance supports the following demands: ending the Korean War, prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons in accordance with the Geneva Protocol, and respecting all international agreements and establishing the broadest cultural relations between all countries in the world.

    I want to tell our noble Chinese friends that our intellectuals are determined to follow your heroic struggle for peace until final victory, because your victory is also our victory.

    On behalf of the Chilean Intellectuals' Alliance and all the people's artists, I would like to express my respect and admiration to the leader of the People's Republic of China, the brilliant beacon of all intellectuals in the world, the writer Mao Zedong.

### 智利代表、画家、智利知识分子联盟主席  米里亚·拉芬脱的发言（摘要）

    智利代表、画家、智利知识分子联盟主席
    米里亚·拉芬脱的发言（摘要）
    我代表智利知识分子联盟和人民艺术家，向这个历史性的会议热烈致敬。
    智利知识分子联盟是在西班牙内战时期由巴勃罗·聂鲁达所创办的，目的在于保卫我们的文化使它不受到法西斯的侵害，抵抗任何有损人类尊严和社会进化的趋势，而现在这个联盟则正在推动并参加和平运动，因为只有在和平的环境中，人类才有可能充分地向前发展。
    大部分智利的艺术家和知识分子，都已经参加了世界人民保卫和平的斗争和全世界被压迫人民的斗争。
    智利是一个经济落后的国家，工人和一般职员的生活水平低得可怕；但是，尽管生活如此贫困，智利的作家和艺术家们并没有出卖自己的灵魂，或者在原则性的问题上妥协。
    由于人民和艺术家间的团结，在智利我们可以看到我们的活动方向的转变，那就是一种新的现实主义正在迅速地朝着那种艺术必须与民族独立运动合作并为和平服务的现实主义标准发展着。
    智利有富饶的天然资源。智利的土地下埋藏着极丰富的极端重要的工业矿藏。智利素来以硝石和铜的生产著称于世。我们还出产铁、煤和锰。这些都是我们的主要富源。但是，这些富源直到现在一直也是我们的不幸，因为帝国主义一开始就对它注意：起初还是注意，然后就用手和枪炮来抢夺了。
    先是在十九世纪初叶的英帝国主义，接着来了美国人，用它的金元夺取了铜矿、铁矿，凡是它能夺到手的东西，都夺过来。从那时候起，我们的祖国就一天天地被卖出去了。外国压力愈来愈公开愈野蛮。在过去这几年中，新的硝石矿藏也被帝国主义掠夺了去。对于我们的铜矿的垄断变得越来越厉害。我们的油田，一直到最近还差不多是完全未加开采的，现在也被世界托辣斯所控制了。最近才发现的铀矿，变成了智利政府和美国大使谈判的主题。
    帝国主义千方百计在文化方面所进行的种种工作已使我国文化处于极端危险的境地。帝国主义的目的是要削弱我们，剥夺我们至今还完整保持着的东西——民族意识；这种民族意识就是我们都知道，我国虽然是一个很小的国家，但我们在国际大家庭中占着有价值的地位，我们知道，我们的国家能够产生完全智利型的伟大的诗人、历史学家、各种思想领域和工作领域的伟大创造者，并能给世界文化宝库以极珍贵的贡献。帝国主义者要使我们成为世界主义者。他们要我们抛开我们自己的问题。
    我们肯定人类所创造的一切价值是有普遍性的。我们肯定托玛斯·曼、萨宁·卡诺、希克梅特、乔治·亚马多、郭沫若或爱伦堡都有他的普遍性，但我们决不能承认那种牺牲民族的普遍性。同时我们也肯定那种与各个国家的特殊传统相调和的普遍性，那种可以使曾经得到过世界和平奖金的巴勃罗·聂鲁达那样的智利诗人受到世界人民的珍视和爱戴的普遍性，那种普遍性能使我们在莎士比亚的作品里深切地了解英国的本质而在拉培雷的作品里了解真正的法国的本质。
    但是帝国主义对于这种以民族性格为第一要义的普遍性是不感兴趣的。帝国主义所要的普遍性，是那种可以使一个智利人忘记自己归根结底还是智利人的普遍性。帝国主义对我们的文化的要求就是要它不反映我们的独立和我们对于解放的迫切要求。
    帝国主义使用了一切能利用的手段以求达到这个目的。它用奖学金来引诱青年知识分子。它以煽动战争的或是令人作呕的浅薄的影片充塞我们的电影界。它以同样性质的书刊大量供给我们，并替这些书刊进行疯狂的宣传。它垄断了我们的图书业，使我们的市场充当着赞扬罪恶和强盗行为的袖珍本的侦探小说。它宣扬对于那种所谓北美洲的种族优越性的崇拜，尽力把在朝鲜的北美侵略者描写为传奇式的人物，并极力制造隔绝和分裂。它企图破坏我们与别的国家，包括南美洲的国家在内，建立文化联系的一切可能性。
    这一切给我国民族文化带来了致命的危险。这个问题也同样影响着所有的拉丁美洲国家。
    最近，米斯特拉尔与萨宁·卡诺、豪金·加西亚·孟赫共同向美洲的知识分子发出呼吁，号召他们开会，讨论与他们自己和美洲各国人民都有关系的问题。美洲各国已决定明年年初在智利的圣地亚哥举行这次大会。
    智利的知识分子参加了他们人民的一切斗争。他们在言行上一直与那些在这条或那条阵线上进行争取和平与进步的斗争的组织在一起，这些阵线要不是反对与美国签订军事公约或教育协定，便是要求恢复民权或与世界上所有国家保持关系。在必要的时候，知识分子也走到街头上去。他们团结在工会和所有那些号召他们参加行动的组织周围，因为人民的斗争就是他们自己的斗争。
    智利知识分子联盟支持下面的各项要求：结束朝鲜战争，遵照日内瓦议定书的规定禁用细菌武器，并尊重一切国际协定以及建立世界各国间最广泛的文化关系。
    我要告诉我们高贵的中国朋友，我国知识分子决心追随你们英勇的争取和平的斗争，直到赢得最后胜利为止，因为你们的胜利也就是我们的胜利。
    我谨代表智利知识分子联盟及所有的人民艺术家，向中华人民共和国的领袖、世界一切知识分子的光辉灿烂的灯塔、作家毛泽东表示敬重和钦佩之意。
