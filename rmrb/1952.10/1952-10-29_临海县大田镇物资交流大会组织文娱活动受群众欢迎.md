    To the Editor: Organizing cultural and recreational activities to conduct various forms of propaganda during rural market materials exchange conferences is a practice worth promoting. In September, our Datian Town in Linhai County held a primary market materials exchange conference focusing on retail sales. At the conference, we established a cultural service station, an exhibition, and a broadcasting station, and organized film teams, slideshow teams, puppet troupes, Yue Opera troupes, and rural theater troupes to perform. These activities were warmly welcomed by the masses. The exhibition included sections on agricultural production, maternal and child health, Sino-Soviet friendship, and resistance to America and aid to Korea. In the agricultural production exhibition alone, 17,952 people visited in two days. Farmers were most interested in the exhibited new-style farm tools and pest control equipment. Some farmers wanted to try the pest control sprayers after seeing them, and some wanted to buy one to take home. Because each one cost over a hundred thousand yuan, which one household could not afford, the explainers told everyone about the benefits of organizing and participating in mutual aid teams, explaining that several families could afford to buy one together. The most attractive part of the maternal and child health exhibition was the physical education demonstration comparing new and old midwifery methods. The explainer (a midwife) used her own experience to explain the harms of the old method of delivery and the benefits of the new method. Many women were very moved after hearing this. Wang Juxiang, a woman from Jingtou Village, Liangtoumen Township, Dongcheng District, cried when she thought of her own pain, saying, "I gave birth to three children, all of whom were killed by the old method of delivery, and my husband still scolded me." After seeing the patriotic health posters, exhibits, and models, Zhou Xiaomei, a farmer from Houzhuang Village, Tangli Township, Datian District, said, "When I heard about patriotic health work in the village, I didn't understand it very well, but now I understand it all after seeing the exhibition." In addition, the Sino-Soviet friendship and Resist America, Aid Korea photo exhibitions, and the political map comparing the strength of the two major camps in the world, were also visited by many farmers. These exhibitions played a significant role in improving farmers' production technology, promoting production increase competitions, exchanging production experience, promoting new-style farm tools, and publicizing various policies. The most popular items in the cultural service station were comic strips and pictures. After seeing pictures of the happy life of Soviet collective farmers, farmers said, "We will be even better when we get to socialism. Now we must work hard to produce."

    The film teams, slideshow teams, Yue Opera troupes, rural theater troupes, etc., organized by the conference, had a total audience of more than 14,000 people. Their performances of programs such as "When the Grapes are Ripe," "Production Cooperative," "Preferential Treatment for Military Dependents," and "Brother and Sister Going to Market," which were coordinated with the central work, were all warmly welcomed by the masses. The general feedback was: in the past, the Kuomintang reactionary rule's market was full of gambling stalls; now, not only can you buy things, but there are also pictures to see and operas to watch. Farmers, in order to see the movie "Female Tractor Driver," some ignored the blazing sun and waited to buy tickets, and some who could not get home after the late night show slept in the theater overnight. All of this shows that the broad masses of farmers have a very urgent need for cultural entertainment.

    临海县大田镇物资交流大会组织文娱活动受群众欢迎
    编辑同志：在乡镇的物资交流大会中，通过文化娱乐活动进行各项宣传是值得推广的形式。我们临海县大田镇九月间曾举行了以零售为主的初级市场物资交流大会，会上，我们举办了文化服务站、展览会、广播站，并组织了电影队、幻灯队、木偶剧团、越剧团、农村剧团等进行演出，这些活动受到了群众的热烈欢迎。展览会的内容有农业生产、妇幼卫生、中苏友好和抗美援朝等部分。仅农业生产展览部分，两天就有一万七千九百五十二人参观。农民对展览的新式农具、除虫器具最感兴趣。有的农民看了治虫的喷射器后都很想试一试，有的农民想买一架回去。因为要十几万元一架，一家人家买不起，讲解员就向大家讲组织起来参加互助组的好处，说明几家人合买就买得起了。妇幼卫生展览室里最吸引人的是新、旧接生法对比的实物教育。讲解员（接生婆）根据自己经验来说明旧法接生的害处，和新法接生的好处；很多妇女听了非常感动。东塍区两头门乡井头村妇女王菊香联想到自己的痛苦时哭了，她说：“我生了三个小孩，都被旧法接生害死了，丈夫还骂我。”看了爱国卫生的挂图、实物和模型展览品以后，大田区塘里乡后庄村农民周小妹说：“在村里听讲爱国卫生工作，听不大懂，现在看了一次展览会都弄明白了。”此外，中苏友好、抗美援朝图片展览及世界两大阵营力量对比的政治大挂图，参观的农民也是很多的。这些展览会对农民提高生产技术、推动丰产竞赛、交流生产经验、推广新式农具、宣传各种政策，均起了很大的作用。文化服务站里最受欢迎的是连环图画和图片，农民看了苏联集体农民幸福生活的图片后，说：“我们到社会主义就更好了，现在要努力生产。”
    大会组织的电影队、幻灯队、越剧团、农村剧团等的演出，共有观众一万四千多人。他们配合中心工作演出的“葡萄熟了的时候”、“生产合作社”、
    “优待军属”、“兄妹赶集”等节目，都受到了群众热烈的欢迎。一般的反映是：过去国民党反动统治的集市上都是赌博摊；现在不但有东西买，还有画看、有戏看。农民们为了看一看电影“女拖拉机手”，有的不顾太阳当头晒，等着买票，有的夜戏晚了赶不上回家就睡在戏场里过夜。这些都说明了广大的农民对文化娱乐的要求是非常迫切的。
