(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 12th) According to reports from American newspapers and news agencies: In order to continue stealing the name of the United Nations and spur other countries to expand their war of aggression against Korea, the American aggressors are preparing to propose so-called "proposals expressing a 'hard-line' policy" at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. The U.S. side's unreasonable act of announcing the indefinite suspension of armistice negotiations in Panmunjom is part of this new conspiracy.

According to a report in the American "Christian Science Monitor" on October 1st, the U.S. government has drafted two proposals to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. "One will be submitted when the General Assembly opens, and the other will be submitted a month or more later." The first proposal will force other countries in the United Nations to "express their approval of the United States' handling of the truce negotiations in Panmunjom on behalf of the United Nations" and will require the Korean and Chinese sides to accept a method that "no prisoner should be forced to return home against his will." If this method, which has been repeatedly declared by the Korean and Chinese sides as absolutely unacceptable and violates the Geneva Convention, is rejected, "then the proposal expressing a 'hard-line' policy will be put forward."

The American aggressors want to propose at the United Nations General Assembly an unreasonable plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war, which they know is unacceptable to the Korean and Chinese sides, and demand that the Korean and Chinese sides accept it. This is obviously an attempt to create an excuse to continue or even expand the war of aggression against Korea, in order to mobilize those other countries that the United States calls half-hearted to provide more manpower and material resources to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the Wall Street monopoly capitalists, and to force these countries to share the responsibility for sabotaging the armistice negotiations and expanding the war of aggression. The United Press International's New York United Nations dispatch on the 5th admitted that the U.S. government's plan is to first ask these countries to "agree" with what the United States "has done so far," and then say that since you agree, then you should "more fully support this war in terms of troops and supplies." As early as September 11th, Wall Street's mouthpiece, the "New York Times," had rebuked these countries, saying: "Now is the time when the entire United Nations, especially certain member states, must face the reality of the problem, and must put forward their own new solutions to the problem, otherwise, they must bear the responsibility for future developments not only in words but also in deeds."

The American aggressors' attempt to put the Korean issue to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion is the result of their complete failure in the war of aggression against Korea. Everyone remembers that the U.S. government used all kinds of illegal and despicable means to prevent the Sixth United Nations General Assembly from discussing the Korean issue proposed by the United States itself. At that time, arrogant U.S. generals still thought that they could use military offensives to get what they could not get at the armistice negotiation table. They were afraid that the discussions of the United Nations General Assembly would hinder them from obtaining the fruits of military victory.

However, the facts of the past eight months have proved that the American aggressors have not been able to achieve the victory they expected, either on the front lines or at the negotiating table. On the contrary, things are getting worse and worse for them. Their casualty figures are soaring. Although the American aggressors hope to stimulate the arms race in the United States and other countries by continuing the Korean War and delay the outbreak of the economic crisis, the increasing casualties have made the American people increasingly opposed to this "unpopular war of unknown purpose." The American "World-Telegram and Sun" admitted on September 20th that the American "public's resentment of the war situation and the long-term stalemate in Panmunjom may erupt into hysteria." Now that the American aggressors want to continue and even expand the Korean War, they have to try their best to use the casualties of soldiers from other countries to replace the casualties of American soldiers, in order to alleviate the dissatisfaction of the vast number of American people. A United Press International Washington dispatch on October 9th revealed this despicable intention of the U.S. government. The news said: "There are strong indications in Washington that the United States is willing to drag on indefinitely in Korea because it wants to rely on non-American soldiers to take over the task of combat... This can reduce the number of American casualties." It is precisely for this purpose that the U.S. government has chosen the United Nations General Assembly as the place for it to spur these countries to provide cannon fodder.

This shameless conspiracy of the American aggressors, which aims to further oppress the United Nations to support their destruction of the Geneva Convention and expansion of the war, nakedly exposes the hideous features of their warmongers. It cannot scare the great Korean and Chinese people. The Korean and Chinese side will continue to unswervingly fight for the repatriation of all prisoners of war in accordance with the sacred principles of the Geneva Convention. If the American aggressors refuse to remember the lessons given to them by the powerful Korean and Chinese People's forces for more than two years, then they will surely encounter even greater failures. They will also be strongly opposed by the people of the world, including the American people. As for those other countries that are bound by the U.S. dollar, they are now being forced by the U.S. government to face the abyss of a greater war. Will they follow U.S. imperialism to self-destruct in the expanding flames of war? Or will they jump out of the quagmire of the war of aggression against Korea, so that the Korean armistice can be realized? This is the time for them to make a final choice.

### 美国阴谋利用联大扩大侵朝战争

    美国阴谋利用联大扩大侵朝战争
    【新华社开城十二日电】据美国报纸和通讯社报道：美国侵略者为了继续盗窃联合国名义，鞭策其他国家来扩大进行侵朝战争，准备在即将举行的联合国大会中提出所谓“表示‘强硬’政策的提案”。美方在板门店宣布无限期中止停战谈判的无理破坏行为，乃是这个新阴谋的一部分。
    据美国“基督教科学箴言报”在十月一日报道说，美国政府已经拟就了将在联合国大会上提出的两个提案。“一个将在联大开幕时提出，另一个将在开幕以后一个月或更久以后提出”。第一个提案将迫使联合国中的其他国家“对代表联合国的美国在板门店处理休战谈判的做法表示赞同”，并将要求朝中方面接受“不应违反任何俘虏自己的意志而将他强迫遣送回家”的办法。如果这个早为朝中方面一再声明绝对不能接受的违反日内瓦公约的办法遭到拒绝，“那末表示‘强硬’政策的提案将要提出来”。
    美国侵略者想在联合国大会上提出明知为朝中方面所不能接受的强迫扣留战俘的无理方案，要求朝中方面接受，这显然是企图替继续以至扩大侵朝战争制造藉口，以便动员那些美国所谓三心两意的其他国家拿出更多的人力物力来替华尔街垄断资本家火中取栗，并迫使这些国家分担破坏停战谈判、扩大侵略战争的责任。合众社纽约联合国五日电承认，美国政府的计划是首先要求这些国家“同意”美国“到目前为止已经做过的事”，然后说，既然你们同意，那你们就应该“在军队与供应品方面更充分地支持这个战争”。早在九月十一日，华尔街的喉舌“纽约时报”就已经训斥这些国家说：“现在已经是这样的时候了：联合国全体，特别是某些会员国必需正视问题的现实，并且必须提出它们自己的新的解决问题的办法，要不然，就必须不仅在言语上，而且也在行动上承担对于将来事态发展的责任。”
    美国侵略者企图把朝鲜问题放到联合国大会上去讨论，是它在侵朝战争中遭到彻底失败的结果。大家记得，美国政府曾经用尽一切非法的、卑鄙的手段，阻止联合国第六届大会讨论美国自己提出来的朝鲜问题。那时候，狂妄自大的美国将领们还以为他们能用军事进攻来得到他们在停战谈判桌上所不能得到的东西，他们唯恐联合国大会的讨论会妨碍他们取得军事胜利的果实。
    可是八个月来的事实，证明美国侵略者无论在前线上，无论在谈判桌上，都没有能够得到他们所期望的胜利。恰恰相反，事情对他们愈来愈不妙了。他们的伤亡数字正在扶摇直上。美国侵略者虽然希望用继续进行朝鲜战争来刺激美国以及其他国家的军备竞赛，延缓经济危机的爆发，但是愈来愈大的伤亡却使美国人民愈来愈反对这个“不得人心的不知为何而战的战争了。”九月二十日美国“世界电讯与太阳报”承认，美国“公众怨恨战局及板门店的长期僵局的情绪，可能会爆发成为歇斯底里症”。美国侵略者现在既要继续进行以至扩大朝鲜战争，就不得不想尽量用其他国家士兵的伤亡来代替美国士兵的伤亡，以缓和美国广大人民的不满。合众社华盛顿十月九日的消息透露了美国政府的这种卑劣意图。这个消息说：“华盛顿有强烈的迹象表明美国愿意在朝鲜无尽期地拖下去，是因为它想依赖非美国士兵来接替作战的任务……这是可以减少美国的伤亡人数的。”正是为了达到这个目的，美国政府选择了联合国大会作为它鞭策这些国家出炮灰的场所。
    美国侵略者这种旨在更进一步压迫联合国来支持他们破坏日内瓦公约并扩大战争的无耻阴谋，赤裸裸地暴露了他们战争贩子的狞恶面目。它是吓不倒伟大的朝中人民的。朝中方面将继续坚持不渝地为按照日内瓦公约的神圣原则遣返全部战俘而斗争。如果美国侵略者不肯记取强大的朝中人民部队两年多来所给予他们的教训，那末他们必定将遭遇更大的失败。也必将遭到包括美国人民在内的全世界人民的强烈反对。而对于那些被美元束缚着的其他国家来说，它们现在正被美国政府逼着面临更大的战争的深渊。跟着美帝国主义一起在扩大的战火中自取覆亡呢？还是跳出侵朝战争的泥坑，从而使朝鲜停战得以实现呢？这是它们作最后抉择的时候了。
