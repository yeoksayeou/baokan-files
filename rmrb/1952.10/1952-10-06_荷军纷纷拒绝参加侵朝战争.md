    Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, 2nd. TASS dispatch: Dutch newspapers reported that a Dutch battalion in Korea was recently sent to the front lines and suffered heavy losses in combat. Newspapers publish lists of fallen soldiers daily. Newspapers also point out that incidents of desertion or refusal to fight for the American interventionists are increasing within the Dutch battalion. The authorities are intensifying repressive measures and acts of terror in an attempt to suppress the soldiers' protests against the Netherlands' participation in the criminal war against the Korean people. According to the Dutch "World Daily," the Dutch military court sentenced soldier Carnes to five years in prison for refusing to go to Korea to fight for the American interventionists.

    荷军纷纷拒绝参加侵朝战争
    【新华社讯】塔斯社海牙二日电：荷兰报纸报道，在朝鲜的荷军一个营，最近被送上前线，并在战斗中遭到了重大的损失。报纸每日公布阵亡士兵的名单。报纸也指出，荷兰营中开小差或拒绝为美国干涉者作战的事件是越来越多了。当局正在加紧采取镇压措施与恐怖行动，企图压制士兵们对荷兰参加反朝鲜人民的罪恶战争的抗议。据荷兰“世界日报”报道，荷兰军事法庭判处士兵卡恩斯五年徒刑，因为他拒绝到朝鲜为美国干涉者作战。
