    Report from Le Dinh Tham, Head of the Vietnamese Delegation, on the Issue of National Independence

    Presidium, esteemed delegates:

    The Vietnamese People's Delegation feels boundless joy and excitement as it faces the Asia and Pacific Peace Conference, which is proceeding victoriously. On behalf of the Vietnamese people, we extend our heartfelt greetings to you all and convey the Vietnamese people's fervent desire for independence, freedom, and peace.

    Because of the victory of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, we are able to gather joyfully in Beijing to carry out a historically significant mission. We express our highest respect and gratitude to Chairman Mao and the Chinese people.

    Gentlemen!

    "National independence and world peace," although two distinct issues, are closely intertwined. World peace can only be achieved when nations attain independence; conversely, national independence can only be guaranteed when there is world peace.

    Faced with the threat of a new world war, the independence of various nations in Asia and the Pacific is encountering increasingly severe threats and violations. Many countries' internal affairs are being interfered with, their economies are being monopolized, and they are being subjected to blockades in all aspects. Some countries are being forced to sign treaties in preparation for war, compelled to cede their territory as foreign military bases or allow foreign troops to occupy their lands. Wars have erupted in many countries due to the invasion of enemy forces.

    This situation has already been summarized in the report on national independence presented by the Chilean delegate. Following that report, please allow us to introduce the situations of countries suffering from armed intervention, as armed aggression is a blatant form of infringing upon national independence. It has provoked local wars in Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya, and is deepening the crisis of a world war.

    (I)

    The highest and most intense form used by aggressors in interfering in Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya is armed aggression. However, while conducting armed aggression, they also employ other forms, such as economic and cultural interference. All these forms of aggression are combined to eliminate the free will of the people of the invaded countries by any means.

    Aggressor armies are the instruments of war used by the interveners to realize their conspiracies, built upon the most brutal policies passed down through generations. They create divisions between ethnic groups, inciting one to attack another. They sow discord among the people of the same country, causing them to kill each other. In Korea, American imperialism, using the banner of the United Nations, mobilized the armies of fourteen countries to attack Korea, while also organizing the Syngman Rhee puppet army, implementing a policy of Koreans fighting Koreans. In Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, the French invading army includes seventeen different ethnic groups, in addition to French and French colonial troops, including mercenaries of various races, including members of Hitler's SS troops. Furthermore, French colonialists and American aggressors are now working to organize puppet armies in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, implementing their policy of using local people to fight local people. The situation in Malaya is similar. Since 1950, the British rulers have also used Malayans as mercenary troops to massacre the Malayan people striving for national independence. Recently, the interveners have also been mutually deploying troops, using the army of one intervened country to attack another.

    The aggressors spare no brutal actions to eliminate the free will of the invaded nations, employing insane violence and malicious conspiracies to conquer another nation. In Korea, they adopted a policy of inhumane destruction, using bacteriological weapons, creating monstrous crimes condemned by all of humanity. In Malaya, they dropped poison gas bombs on civilian villages. Elsewhere, they are similarly conducting insane bombing campaigns aimed at massacres of peaceful residents. For example, in March 1952, in Cambodia, they bombed the village of Da Bang Lei to the ground, burning 300 civilian houses and killing 50 residents. Even the precious ancient cultural heritage of the Khmer people, the Da Bang Dek Temple, was damaged. In Laos, in April 1951, the village of Song Viny in Vientiane Province was bombed into a field of rubble. In July 1951, the villages of Ban Mei and Ban Wu suffered the same fate. In Vietnam, with the help of American imperialism, French aircraft have recently used more gasoline bombs. They dropped gasoline bombs and other bombs all over the small villages of the Viet Bac plains and in densely populated areas. In March 1952, their aircraft dropped a large number of gasoline bombs in the Dong Cao and Yue Lu areas of Thai Binh Province, burning 2,000 civilian houses. In addition to using gasoline bombs, incendiary bombs, and other bombs to massacre people, the aggressors also use all other extremely barbaric and unconscionable means of killing people. Since ancient times, every country has had the custom of respecting the elderly. However, just this April, French aggressors buried alive twenty-six of our elderly people in Duc Ban Village in Ha Nam Province.

    Terror and slaughter cannot weaken the free will of millions of men and women who have resolved to "rather die than be slaves." Economic sabotage has become an unparalleled vicious strategic action. This July, American interventionist aircraft bombed the hydroelectric plant on the Yalu River. This monstrous crime of destroying the precious fruits of labor is enough to expose their true face as enemies of the people's lives. In other countries, especially in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya, the aggressors adopted an extremely savage and malicious policy of killing people by creating famine. Japanese fascists and their running dogs, the French reactionary colonialists, used this policy in Vietnam, causing a severe famine in 1945 that killed two million people. Today, this fascist barbarity is being reenacted by imperialists in Malaya, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. They use various methods to destroy all food supplies for the people's livelihoods. In Malaya, they use chemicals to destroy crops. In Laos, in December 1951, in Mangshan, Shenna Province, they robbed the people of their grain and threw it all into the river. In Vietnam, Colonel Duras, following the intention of Lieutenant General Lima Reis, the commander of the French army in Viet Bac, issued order No. ZTC699, ordering: "French troops must loot or burn all the grain in the villages. Burn all the grain with gasoline. If the amount of grain is too large, report to the air force for assistance." In just one small village of Minh Duc in Hai Duong Province, they looted or burned more than 2,000 tons of grain. The invading army not only destroys the food that has already been produced, but also actively destroys the production work that is carried out with extreme difficulty under wartime conditions. In Malaya, they drove 500,000 farmers away from their hometowns, leaving vast fields barren. In Laos, those farmers who were driven away from their hometowns had to abandon their fields and search for food in the mountains and forests. In Vietnam, they put forward the slogan "Killing a Vietnamese farmer is equivalent to killing a Vietnamese soldier." The interveners also paid special attention to slaughtering draught animals, because draught animals are the precious property of Asian farmers. In Cambodia, they killed thousands of draught animals. Vietnamese farmers had to drag the plow themselves because too many draught animals were killed. Everyone knows how important water is to rice. But General Valemi, commander of the French army in central Vietnam, issued a notice on January 11, 1951, to "completely destroy sluice gates and all water conservancy projects." In March, April, and May of this year, in central Vietnam, French aircraft bombed sluice gates and canals used to divert water for irrigation. At the same time that the American aggressors were bombing the hydroelectric power plant on the Yalu River, on June 13, 1952, eighty B-26 French aircraft took turns bombing the Tuo Kuang sluice gate in Vietnam. This sluice gate was used to defend the entire eastern area of northern Vietnam from floods, and it was also a water conservancy project for irrigating the vast fields of the three rich provinces of Thai Nguyen, Bac Giang, and Bac Ninh.

    Obviously, they are attempting to exterminate other nations by creating famine, to create chronic but also the surest death for people by destroying daily necessities, and to force people to surrender and submit to them by all means of abuse and cruelty.

    In Malaya, there are 410 concentration camps that they euphemistically call "New Immigration Villages," but these so-called "villages" with beautiful names are surrounded by electrified barbed wire. Under the threat of enemy guns, 265,000 Malayan residents were forced to leave their hometowns to go there, and many people died on the way. In Laos, residents living along the road from Vientiane to Prabang were also driven to other concentration areas. In Vietnam, in October 1951, 16,000 people from the three counties of Tien Hung, Duyen Ha, and Hung Nhan in Thai Binh Province were driven to the large-scale concentration camp in Bo City. They stood in a football field surrounded by five layers of barbed wire. Sixteen thousand people were forced to squeeze together like this, day after day, suffering. Old people leaning on crutches and mothers holding babies suffered from wind and rain, scorching sun, and torture by the French invading army. Many people died because they could not bear the pain, fatigue, hunger, and thirst. Among them, 68 infants in swaddling clothes starved to death in their mothers' arms due to lack of milk.

    Here, we want to emphasize a serious disaster that the people of Asian countries living in war are suffering today, that is, barbaric acts of rape. In Malaya and Vietnam, interveners are frantically and shamelessly continuing to expand the despicable act of raping women. Respect for women is the virtue of any civilized nation. However, in any place occupied or passed through by the invading army, they carried out the beastly act of gang rape. This inhuman act is regarded as a tactical means and encouraged by their superior officers. In Cambodia, French troops raped girls in Buddhist schools. In Vietnam, they raped nuns in Gao Mai Catholic Church. In some places, as many as 80% of women were raped. The crime of rape not only lost human morality and insulted women, but also brought disaster to society, that is, the prevalence of venereal diseases.

    However, when a nation has risen up to fight to defend its peaceful life, the atrocities of war-mongers cannot weaken their fighting will. The crimes of war-mongers can only deepen their hatred for war-mongers and strengthen their fighting will.

    The people of countries suffering from armed intervention have been suffering from the disasters of war since World War II. Today, they are fighting to end this disaster. They firmly oppose war and sincerely hope that mankind can avoid the disaster of a new world war.

    (II)

    Today's war of aggression in Korea is the first step in the plan of the American-led imperialist group to invade Asia and provoke a new world war. When the Korean War first started, the people of the world had already seen this clearly. The Korean issue is no longer just a matter of concern for the people of our Asia. For more than two years, this issue has become a daily concern for good people all over the world.

    Other armed interventions in the Asia and Pacific region are also part of the invasion plan of the American-led aggressor group to invade Asia. For example, Acheson once stated that "Vietnam will become the second Korea." McDonald, the British High Commissioner in Malaya, once said: "The fate of the free world in Southeast Asia is determined on the battlefield of northern Vietnam." The French Plevin said it even more bluntly. In July 1950, he said, "What France has been doing in Indochina (referring to Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos) for five years is exactly the same as what the United States is doing in Korea. This is the two wings of a battle line."

    The policy of the American imperialists is to support the British policy in Malaya and to assist the French colonialists in carrying out wars of aggression in the territories of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Today, American imperialism has openly interfered in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries. Various imperialist countries have blatantly monopolized the economies of Southeast Asian countries and occupied various strategic materials. Eighty percent of the rubber and fifty-two percent of the tin used by American imperialism are plundered from Southeast Asia.

    For seven years, the planes, artillery, various weapons, and all military supplies used by the French colonialists in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia have been supplied by American imperialism. By 1951, the military expenses used by the American imperialists in the war of aggression against Vietnam had reached 2.2 billion US dollars. In the talks between American envoys Truman, Hayes, and French High Commissioner Bignon in September 1950, the American imperialists proposed to the French colonialists the request to let them use all the airfields in Vietnam. On December 23, 1950, American imperialism and French imperialism and their puppets in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos signed a so-called joint defense of Indochina agreement. In this agreement, French imperialism and its running dogs allowed the American imperialists to use the seaports of Haiphong, Tourane, Cam Ranh Bay, and Saigon "when necessary." At present, the French colonialists' command structure in Indochina has so-called military and other departmental advisors of American imperialism. Truman and Hayes, the special envoys of American imperialism in Indochina, are now sitting in Saigon instructing the commanders of the French colonialists and manipulating the puppets of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos behind the scenes. Trapnell replaced Barling, who committed suicide six months ago, as the head of the American military advisory group in Saigon. American imperialist invasion General Krich directly serves as the chief of staff of the French Air Force in the Far East.

    The most prominent manifestation of the American imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war of aggression in Southeast Asia is their intervention in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, which Acheson called "the key to Southeast Asia." A French peace fighter, Pierre Godeau, wrote: "Without American aid, the war in Vietnam would have ended long ago." On March 13 of this year, US Secretary of Defense Lovett said in a speech to the US Congress: "The strategic and geographical location of this region of Vietnam, as well as the very important raw materials it supplies, such as tin and rubber, make it necessary for us to continue to support the French government with effective action..." The French rulers have repeatedly admitted that they are carrying out wars of aggression in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in order to protect American interests. Former Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in Indochina Tassigny said: "France sends French youth and commanders to Vietnam, 12,000 kilometers away from home, to die for the benefit of others." Using the blood of French youth that the French rulers cheaply sold to them, American imperialism is trying to turn Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos into their colonies in Southeast Asia, providing rich strategic materials and important military bases.

    According to the common plan of the American-led aggressor group, the British rulers are actively implementing conscription in Malaya.

    Recently, the American-led imperialist group has been more actively expanding the war in Southeast Asia. In June 1951, the commanders-in-chief of the American, British, and French forces in the Far East met in Singapore to formally discuss how to collude to realize this conspiracy. From the Singapore meeting attended by Tassigny, Harding, and Stuver, to the Honolulu meeting, American, British, and French politicians and military commissioners held continuous meetings in Washington and Paris to advance their conspiracy. In July of this year, American, French, British, and Australian military commissioners met again to discuss the establishment of a standing committee in Indochina to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam and prepare for an attack on China. Simultaneously with the restoration of Japanese militarization, the sabotage of the Panmunjom negotiations, and the war of aggression against Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya, are serious threats to Asian and world peace and flames of war that imperialists are preparing to use to burn Asia and the world.

    (III)

    Armed aggression is directly threatening the common peace and security of mankind. The people of all countries who are forced to take up arms to defend their independence realize that lasting world peace can only be guaranteed when national independence is respected.

    This deep understanding has strengthened their fighting will.

    The unity between all countries and all nations, and the unanimous desire of the people of the whole country for freedom and peace, is the source of their powerful strength. No matter which country it is, the unity of the nation has a solid and broad foundation. Korea has the Korean Fatherland Front; Malaya has the Anti-British Alliance; Cambodia has the Cambodian National United Front; Laos has the Lao Free Front; and Vietnam has the Viet Minh Front. In addition, the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos also have the alliance of the three peoples.

    The people, who have a high degree of patriotism and love for peace, have increasingly strong fighting power. Encouraged by the great victory of the heroic Korean people, the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Malaya are working harder and winning many victories. In Cambodia, the Cambodian Liberation Army has launched 170 battles of various sizes in the past six months. In Vietnam, the Vietnamese People's Army has eliminated 220,000 invading troops in seven years of fighting, including 140,000 European and African soldiers. The enemy's "annual death of officers on the Vietnamese battlefield is more than the annual training of French military academies." These serious losses have made it very embarrassing for the French rulers to implement the American master's order to join the North Atlantic Army.

    Because they love labor, love peace, and yearn for a better life, these nations fighting for independence are striving to build their own motherland in many ways while fighting against the invaders. In the liberated areas of Malaya, Laos, and Cambodia, farmers are actively increasing production, and the activities of eliminating illiteracy are also developing vigorously. Due to the patriotic competition movement, the young Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which grew up in the smoke of war, has not only achieved successive military victories, but also achieved brilliant results in national construction. Although in a state of war, the lives of the broad masses of people are much better than during the French colonial rule. The Vietnamese People's Government pays attention to improving the people's lives and encourages the people to produce. This year, the people of Vietnam are working hard to implement the plan to increase production and practice economy, and agricultural productivity has increased by 10%. Especially in the liberated areas, there have been no disasters or epidemics in the seven years of war. Since the August Revolution of 1945, 200,000 voluntary and unpaid cultural teachers have freed 14 million people from illiteracy. This year, 70% of the Vietnamese people are literate, which is a big difference from the 10% literacy rate during the French colonial rule. Vietnam's national education is developing from elementary school to university. In Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh and other provinces, there were only 30,000 school children under French colonial rule. Today, this number has soared to 400,000. This cultural movement is booming among the broad masses. The Vietnamese people have many more opportunities to sing, dance, read newspapers, and watch dramas than before. The above-mentioned achievements in labor and culture of the people of various countries in combat show that the lives of the people of various countries are developing towards a new and vibrant aspect. If there is no aggression, no war, how rapid will people's progress be!

    Their struggle is part of the great movement to defend world peace. In Malaya, the signature campaign to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace treaty must be carried out in secret. Many students in Singapore have participated in the signature. In Cambodia, the signature campaign is also continuing to develop. Many monks have also signed. In Laos, the National Cadre Conference of the Lao Free Front launched a signature campaign in July 1951. In Vietnam, 5 million people have signed the Stockholm Declaration, and more than 9 million have signed the Berlin Declaration. The desire for peace of the people of various countries in combat is also clearly expressed in the policy of leniency towards prisoners of war. In particular, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly released prisoners of war from the French and European and African armies. Recently, on May 19, 1952, to celebrate President Ho Chi Minh's birthday, and on July 14, 1952, to commemorate the French Revolution, the Vietnamese government released another 500 prisoners of war. Among those released prisoners of war was Lieutenant Colonel Du Lin, an officer in northern Vietnam, who was the chairman of the Committee for the Defense of World Peace in the POW camp.

    All nations that are carrying out armed struggles for national independence and world peace have received the sympathy and help of peace-loving people all over the world. They have not only been encouraged by the fraternal countries of neighboring Asian countries and the people of countries far away in Europe, Africa and the Americas, but they have also often received their practical support. The people of various countries who are fighting are very excited and firmly believe that nothing is stronger than the power of a nation's united struggle, and nothing is more powerful than the close friendship between the people of various countries.

    We must emphasize that the people of the United States, Britain, France and other countries are working hard to oppose the wars of aggression being waged in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Malaya. In particular, it should be pointed out that the French people's movement demanding an end to the dirty war in Vietnam and demanding that the French colonial aggressor forces withdraw from Vietnam is growing. French peace vanguards such as Henri Martin and Raymonda Dien are dear comrades-in-arms of the people who are fighting for their independence. The united struggle of the French people and the people of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos is a lofty symbol of the will for peace of mankind today. The mutual cooperation of the struggle between the people of aggressor countries and the people of the countries that are being invaded is an effective action to obstruct the aggressors from launching wars and to defend peace. It should be developed and promoted.

    Distinguished representatives!

    The armed interventions that exist in our region are still continuing and are becoming more intense day by day. The Korean people have lived through the most serious and glorious days in their history in the past two years. The war in Malaya has lasted for four years. The wars in Cambodia and Laos have lasted for nearly seven years. The anti-aggression war in Vietnam has lasted for seven years and ten days.

    As long as these armed interventions do not stop, the struggle of the people of Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya to defend freedom and independence will not end for a day. Facing these increasingly barbaric crimes brought about by armed intervention, the people of the world are loudly appealing, demanding that these evil behaviors can no longer continue to develop, and demanding an immediate end to this unjust war.

    The people of the invaded countries naturally do not want war. They are only forced to take up arms to defend their right to survival and national independence. The people of the countries that launched the war of aggression have long been demanding an end to the war of aggression.

    Only a small handful of people advocate the war of aggression. They attempt to treat the people of some countries as slaves and attempt to launch the Third World War.

    When the independence of one nation is destroyed, the independence of other nations is threatened. Those armed interventions that are continuing are threatening common peace and security. If we are not vigilant, the flames of war burning in local areas can easily turn into large-scale and comprehensive disasters.

    Solving the problem of armed intervention is not an individual problem of the people of the various interfered countries, but a problem of concern to peace-loving people all over the world.

    The Korean representative has put forward specific suggestions on resolving the Korean issue based on the specific circumstances of the Korean War and its special impact on today's international situation. This suggestion is in line with the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world.

    The issue of national independence of the people of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya has also been repeatedly raised by world peace fighters.

    At the World Peace Council held in Vienna in 1951, a resolution was made on resolving the armed conflicts in Vietnam and other places in Southeast Asia such as Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya. Mr. Guo Moruo's general report at this meeting also mentioned this issue. The independence of these nations is one of the necessary factors for defending peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world.

    The people of Asia and the Pacific region must demand:

    Immediately stop the armed interventions in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya. All foreign troops must withdraw from these countries.

    The right to national independence must be respected. The people of all countries must have the right to freely handle all their own affairs without interference from any country.

    These demands are in line with the aspirations of the people of all countries, in line with the principle of national self-determination determined by the United Nations Charter, and in line with the spirit of sacred freedom and equality of mankind and all nations.

    Only when all nations achieve independence can common peace and security be consolidated.

    Without national independence, there can be no true peace in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya, and without national independence, there can be no lasting world peace.

    The peaceful will of the people of Asia, the Pacific and the world, and the desire for independence of the people of all countries who are fighting to defend their independence, will guarantee the independence of all nations.

    Peace will surely triumph. (Xinhua News Agency)

    越南代表团团长黎廷探
    关于民族独立问题的补充报告主席团，各位代表：
    越南人民代表团面对着正在胜利进行着的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，感到无比的愉快和振奋。我们谨代表越南人民向各位致以亲爱的敬礼，并向各位转达越南人民爱好独立、自由与和平的热望。
    由于毛泽东主席所领导的中国人民业已获得胜利，我们才能够在北京欢聚一堂，执行具有历史意义的任务，我们谨向毛主席和中国人民表示崇高的敬意和感谢。
    各位先生！
    “民族独立和世界和平”虽然是两个问题，但却是紧密地互相联在一起的。各民族获得独立，世界才能和平，相反的，也只有世界有了和平，各民族的独立才能得到保障。
    在世界新战争的威胁面前，亚洲及太平洋的各个民族的独立正遭受到愈来愈严重的威胁和侵犯。许多国家的内政被干涉，经济被垄断，各方面都被封锁，有的国家被迫签订了准备战争的条约，被迫将自己的领土作为外国的军事基地或者是让外国军队盘踞在自己的领土上。许多国家由于敌人军队的侵入而引起了战争。
    这种情况，在智利代表所作的关于民族独立问题的报告中已经有了概括的说明。接着这个报告之后，请容许我们介绍一下被武装干涉的各国情况，因为武装侵略是一种明目张胆地侵犯民族独立的形式，它曾经在朝鲜、越南、寮国、高棉、马来亚挑起了局部的战争，而且正在加深着世界战争的危机。
    （一）
    侵略者们在干涉朝鲜、越南、寮国、高棉和马来亚等地的时候，所使用的最高和最剧烈的形式是武装侵略。但是，在进行武装侵略的同时，他们也使用其他形式，如经济、文化的干涉等。所有这一切形式的侵略都是结合在一起的，那就是用一切方法来消灭各被侵略国家人民的自由意志。
    侵略军队是干涉者用以实现其阴谋的战争工具，侵略军队是干涉者们用世代相传的最残酷的政策建立起来的。他们制造各个民族间的分裂，煽动一个民族向其他另外一个民族进攻，他们在同一个国家的人民中进行挑拨离间，使他们互相残杀。在朝鲜，美帝国主义利用联合国的招牌，出动着十四个国家的军队向朝鲜进攻，同时还组织李承晚伪军，实行用朝鲜人打朝鲜人的政策。在越南、寮国和高棉，法国侵略军的成份包括有十七个不同的种族，除了法国和法国殖民地的军队以外，还有包括各个种族的雇佣兵，其中有希特勒SS挺进队的队员，此外，法国殖民者和美国侵略者现在还努力组织越南、高棉和寮国的傀儡军队，实行其用本地人打本地人的政策。马来亚的情形也是如此，为了屠杀争取民族独立的马来亚人民，从一九五○年起，英国统治者们，也用马来亚人作为雇佣军队。最近干涉者们还互相调用军队，用一个被干涉国的军队去进攻另外一个被干涉的国家。
    侵略者不惜以任何残暴的行动来消灭各被侵略民族的自由意志，不惜用疯狂的暴力和恶毒的阴谋去征服另一个民族。他们在朝鲜采用了惨无人道的毁灭政策，使用细菌武器，制造出了为全人类所指责的滔天罪行。在马来亚，他们在平民的村庄里投下毒气弹。在其他地方，他们也同样地在进行着以大量屠杀和平居民为目的的疯狂轰炸，例如，一九五二年三月，在高棉，他们把大邦雷村炸为平地，三百所民房被烧毁，五十个居民被炸死，连那珍贵的高棉民族的古代文化遗迹大邦德克寺也被炸坏了。在寮国，一九五一年四月，万象省的送维尼村被炸成了一片瓦砾之场，一九五一年七月，班美村和班吾村也遭受了同样的命运。在越南，由于得到了美帝国主义的帮助，法国飞机最近所用的汽油弹更多了，他们把汽油弹和其他的炸弹投遍在越北平原上的小乡村以及人口集中的区域中去，一九五二年三月，他们的飞机在太平省的同高、月吕地区中投下了大量的汽油弹，烧毁了两千所民房。除了用汽油弹、烧夷弹和其他炸弹大量屠杀人民以外，侵略者还使用了一切其他极其野蛮的丧尽天良的杀人手段来屠杀人民。自古以来，任何一个国家都有尊重老人的风俗，可是，就在今年四月，法国侵略者却在河南省的德板村活埋了我们二十六位老人。
    恐怖和残杀的手段，不能削弱已经决心“宁死不作奴隶”的千百万男女的自由意志。破坏经济就成了一个无比恶毒的战略行动。今年七月，美国干涉者的飞机轰炸鸭绿江的水电厂。这种摧残珍贵的劳动果实的滔天罪行正足以揭穿他们与人民的生活为敌的真面目。在其他的国家里，特别是在越南、寮国、高棉和马来亚，侵略者们采用了无比野蛮恶毒的政策，用制造饥饿的方法来杀害人民。日本法西斯和他的走狗法国反动殖民者就曾经在越南使用过这种政策，从而造成了一九四五年二百万人被饿死的严重灾荒。这种法西斯的野蛮行为，今天又被帝国主义者在马来亚、寮国、高棉和越南等地重演了。他们要用种种方法来破坏一切供给人民生活的粮食。在马来亚，他们用化学用品来破坏庄稼。在寮国，一九五一年十二月，他们在深那省的芒山把老百姓的谷子抢光，然后全部抛入河里去。在越南，杜拉中校秉承着越北法军总指挥立马黎斯中将的意旨，下了ZTC699号命令，命令：“法国军队必须抢光或烧光各个村庄的粮食。用汽油把一切粮食烧光。如果粮食的数量太多，可以报告空军前往协助”。只在海洋省的一个小的明德村里，他们就劫掠或焚烧了二千吨以上的谷子。侵略军不但破坏已经生产出来的粮食，他们还积极地对在战争条件下极其困难的情况下所进行的生产工作加以摧毁。在马来亚，他们驱逐五十万农民离开自己的乡土，让一望无边的田野荒芜了。在寮国，那些被驱逐离开乡土的农民，要被迫荒芜了自己的田地而到山林中去寻找食粮。在越南，他们提出了“杀一个越南农民等于杀一个越南兵士”的口号。干涉者还特别注意残杀耕畜，因为耕畜是亚洲农民的珍贵财产。在高棉，他们杀死了数以千计的耕畜。越南的农民由于耕畜被杀太多，只好自己拖犁耕地。谁都知道水对禾稻是如何重要的。但越南中部法军总指挥瓦勒美在一九五一年一月十一日发出了一个通知，要“彻底破坏水闸和一切水利工程”。在今年的三、四、五月间，在越南中部，法国飞机轰炸水闸和用以引水灌溉的河渠。在美国侵略者轰炸鸭绿江水电厂的同时，一九五二年六月十三日，八十架B二六式的法国飞机，轮流不断地轰炸越南的托况水闸，这个水闸是用以防御整个越南北部东面一带水患的，同时也是灌溉太原、北江、北宁等三个富裕省份的广大田地的水利工程。
    很明显的，他们企图用制造饥荒的方法来消灭其他的民族，用破坏日常生活资料的方法来给人们制造慢性的但同时也是最有把握的死亡，企图用一切虐待和残酷的手段来迫使人们向他们投降屈服。
    在马来亚，有四百一十个他们美其名为“移民新村”的集中营，但是这些被他们起了漂亮名字的所谓“村”却是四周围绕着通上电流的铁丝网的。二十六万五千马来亚的居民，在敌人的枪口威胁之下被迫离开故乡而到那里去，很多人在途中就已经死亡了。在寮国，居留在从万象到柏拉班的公路两旁的居民也同样被他们驱逐到其他的集中区去。在越南一九五一年十月，太平省的先兴、缘河、兴仁三县有一六、○○○人被驱逐到波市的规模宏大的集中营中，他们站在围绕着五层铁丝网的足球场里，一万六千人就这样被迫挤在一起，一天又一天地站在那里受罪，扶着拐杖的老人，抱着婴儿的母亲饱受风吹雨打烈日晒，受着法国侵略军的拷打，很多人因为受不了痛苦、疲倦、饥饿、口渴的侵袭而死亡了，其中有六十八个还在襁褓中的婴孩由于缺乏乳汁而在母亲的手中活生生地饿死。
    在这里，我们要特别强调生活在战火中的亚洲各国人民，今天所遭受着的一个严重灾难，那就是野蛮的强奸行为，在马来亚和在越南一样，干涉者们正在疯狂无耻地继续扩大强奸妇女的卑鄙行动。尊重妇女是任何一个有文明民族的德性，然而，在任何一个为侵略军所占领或经过的地方，他们就进行了集团强奸的野兽行为。这种灭绝人性的举动，被视为战术的手段而得到了他们上级军官们的鼓励。在高棉法军强奸佛教学校的少女，在越南他们奸污在高卖教堂的女修道士。有些地方竟有百分之八十的妇女被奸污了。奸污的罪恶不但丧失了人类的品德，污辱了女性，它还给社会带来了灾害，那就是花柳病的流行。
    然而，当一个民族已经起来为保卫自己和平生活而斗争的时候，战争贩子的暴行并不能削弱他们的斗争意志，战争贩子的罪恶只能加深他们对战争贩子的仇恨，更加坚定他们的斗争意志。
    正在遭受武装干涉的各国人民，从二次大战以来，就在不断地受着战争的灾难，他们今天正在为着结束这种灾难而斗争，他们坚决反对战争，热诚地渴望人类能够避免一次新的世界大战的灾难。

    今天在朝鲜所进行的侵略战争是以美国为首的帝国主义集团侵略亚洲和挑起世界新战争计划中的第一步。当侵朝战争刚开始时，全世界人民就已经看清了这一点。朝鲜问题已不仅是我们亚洲人民所担忧的问题了。两年多来，这个问题已成为全世界善良的人们每天关心的问题。
    在亚洲及太平洋区域所进行的其他的武装干涉，也是以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团侵略亚洲计划中的一部分，例如艾奇逊曾表示过，“要变越南成为朝鲜第二”。驻马来亚的英国高级专员麦唐纳曾经说：“东南亚自由世界的命运，是决定于越南北部的战场上。”法国的普利文说得更为露骨，他于一九五○年七月间说过，“五年来法国在印度支那（指越、棉、寮三国）所干的事情是和美国在朝鲜所干的事情完全相同的，这是一个战线的两翼”。
    美帝国主义者的政策就是支持英国在马来亚的政策，同时并援助法殖民主义者在越、棉、寮的领土上进行侵略战争。今天美帝国主义已公然干涉东南亚各国的内政，各个帝国主义国家明目张胆地垄断了东南亚各国的经济，霸占着各种战略物资。美帝国主义所用橡胶的百分之八十和所用锡的百分之五十二，都是从东南亚掠夺去的。
    七年来，法殖民主义者在越南、寮国和高棉所使用的飞机大炮和各种武器以及一切军用品都是美帝国主义供应的。到一九五一年为止，美帝国主义者用在侵越战争上的军费已达到二十二亿美元。一九五○年九月间，在美国特派员端兰、海斯和法国高级专员毕容的会谈中，美帝国主义向法殖民主义者提出让他们使用法国在越南所有飞机场的要求。一九五○年十二月二十三日，美帝国主义和法帝国主义及其越、棉、寮的傀儡们签订了一个所谓共同防守印度支那协定，在这个协定中，法帝国主义及其走狗让美帝“在所谓必要的时候”，使用海防、土伦、金兰湾、西贡等海港。目前法殖民主义者在印度支那的指挥机构，都有美帝国主义所谓军事和其他部门的顾问。在印度支那的美帝国主义的特派员端兰、海斯现正坐在西贡指示法殖民主义者的指挥官，并在幕后操纵越、棉、寮的傀儡们。特拉普涅尔，代替了在六个月前自杀的白林克为美帝驻西贡的军事顾问团团长。美帝国主义者侵略将领克立克直接地当法国驻远东空军的参谋长。
    美帝国主义企图扩大东南亚侵略战争的阴谋，表现得最突出的就是他们干涉了被艾奇逊称为“东南亚的钥匙”——越、棉、寮。法国的一位和平战士皮尔·戈特曾经写着：“如果没有美国的援助，越南的战争该早已结束了。”今年三月十三日，美国国防部长罗维特在美国国会讲演时曾经说过：“越南这个区域的战略和地理位置，以及它所供应的甚为重要的原料，例如锡和橡胶等，使我们必须继续以有效的行动支持法国政府……。”法国的统治者屡次的公认他们是为了保护美国的权益，而在越、棉、寮进行侵略战争。前驻印度支那法军总司令塔西尼说过：“法国为了别人的利益而把法国青年和指挥官送到距本国一万二千公里外的越南去送死。”美帝国主义用法国统治者廉价卖给他们的法国青年的血，企图把越、棉、寮变成为他们在东南亚的殖民地，提供富饶的战略物资和重要的军事基地。
    根据以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团的共同计划，英国统治者在马来亚积极实行征兵。
    最近，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团更积极地在东南亚扩大战争。一九五一年六月，美英法远东军队的总司令员，在新加坡会谈正式讨论到如何勾结起来实现这个阴谋。从塔西尼、哈丁、史枢波参加的新加坡会议到檀香山会议，美英法的政客和军事专员，为了推进他们阴谋，曾在华盛顿和巴黎连续不断地开会，今年七月美法英澳的军事专员再开会讨论在印度支那成立一个常务委员会来扩大侵略越南的战争和准备进攻中国的问题。与恢复日本军国主义化同时，破坏板门店谈判，侵略越南、寮国、高棉、马来亚的战争，都是对于亚洲和世界和平的严重威胁，是帝国主义者准备用来燃遍亚洲和全世界的战争火焰。

    武装侵略正直接威胁着人类的共同的和平与安全。被迫拿起武器来保卫自己的独立的各国人民体会到，只有在民族独立得到尊重的情形下，世界的持久和平才能得到保证。
    这种深刻的体会更加强了他们战斗的意志。
    各国内各民族间的团结，以及全国人民对于自由与和平的一致愿望，就是他们强大力量的源泉。不论在那一个国家，民族的团结都有稳固和广泛的基础，朝鲜有朝鲜祖国战线；马来亚有抗英同盟；高棉有高棉民族统一阵线；寮国有寮国自由阵线；越南有越联阵线；此外，越、棉、寮三国人民还有三国人民的联盟。
    具有高度的爱祖国和爱和平的热情的人民，他们斗争的力量日益壮大。越南、高棉、寮国、马来亚等国人民在英勇的朝鲜人民的伟大胜利鼓舞下，越加努力奋斗，并赢得很多的胜利。在高棉，高棉解放军在过去的六个月中已展开了大小一百七十次的战斗。在越南，越南人民军在七年来的战斗中已消灭了二十二万侵略军，其中有十四万欧、非籍的士兵。敌人在越南战场上“每年死亡的军官，比法国军事学院每年所训练出来的还要多”。这些严重的损失，使法国统治者无法执行美国主子参加北大西洋军队的命令而感到非常狼狈。
    由于热爱劳动，热爱和平，渴望更美好的生活，这些为独立而斗争的各民族一面在进行抵抗侵略者的战斗，一面在为建设自己的祖国而作多方面的努力。在马来亚、寮国、高棉的解放区农民积极地增加生产，扫除文盲的活动也正在日益蓬勃地发展着。由于爱国主义竞赛运动，在战争的硝烟中生长起来的年青的越南民主共和国，不仅取得了接连的军事胜利，同时，在建国方面也获得了辉煌的成绩。虽然是处在战争的状况下，但广大的人民群众的生活却要比法殖民主义者统治时期好得多。越南人民政府注意改善人民的生活，鼓励人民生产。今年越南全国人民努力实现增产节约计划，农业的生产率增加了百分之十。尤其是在解放区，在七年战争中，没有发生过灾荒和病疫。自一九四五年八月革命以来，二十万自愿不拿薪水的文化教员使一千四百万人脱离了文盲状态。今年越南人民百分之七十已经识字，比起法殖民主义者统治时期的只有百分之十的人识字是一个很大的差别。越南的国民教育是从小学发展到大学的。在清化、义安、河静等省在法殖民主义者统治时期只有三万学童，今天这个数目已激增到四十万人了。这个文化运动正在广大的群众中蓬勃地发展着。越南人民唱歌、跳舞、阅读书报、看戏的机会比从前多了好几倍。上述的正在战斗中的各国人民在劳动和文化上的成就，表现出各国人民的生活正向着新生的富有朝气的方面发展。假如没有侵略，没有战争，人们的进步该会多么迅速啊！
    他们的战斗是伟大的保卫世界和平运动的一部分。在马来亚，要求五大国缔结和平公约的签名运动要在秘密中进行的。很多新加坡的学生都参加了签名。在高棉，签名运动也在继续发展。很多和尚也都签名了。在寮国，寮国自由战线全国干部会议曾经在一九五一年七月发起了签名运动。在越南已经在斯德哥尔摩的宣言上签名的有五百万人，而在柏林宣言上，签名的已经超过了九百万。战斗中的各国人民热爱和平的心愿，还在宽待俘虏的政策上明显地表示出来。特别是越南民主共和国的政府已经多次释放法国和欧非军队的俘虏。最近，在一九五二年五月十九日祝贺胡志明主席寿辰时和一九五二年七月十四日纪念法国大革命的节日里，越南政府又把五百名战俘释放了。在那些被释放的俘虏中，有越北的一个军官杜林中校，他是战俘营中的保卫世界和平委员会的主席。
    一切正在为了民族独立与世界和平而进行武装斗争的民族，都得到全世界爱好和平人民的同情与帮助，他们不但得到亚洲邻邦各兄弟国家和远在欧洲、非洲和美洲各国人民的鼓舞，而且还常常获得了他们的实际支援。正在进行战斗中的各国人民，他们非常兴奋地深信：没有任何东西会比一个民族团结斗争的力量更强大，没有任何东西比各国人民间的亲爱友谊更有力了。
    我们必须强调指出，美英法等国人民正在努力反对在朝鲜、越南、高棉、寮国和马来亚进行着的侵略战争的运动。特别要指出，法国人民的要求停止在越南的肮脏战争，要求法殖民者的侵略军队撤出越南的运动正在日益壮大着。法国人民的和平先锋战士如亨利·马丁，雷蒙达·第安，他们是正在为争取自己独立而斗争的人民的亲爱战友。法国人民和越南、高棉、寮国人民的团结斗争，是今天人类和平意志的一个崇高的标志，侵略国与被侵略国人民的互相配合的斗争，对于阻挠侵略者发动战争和保卫和平，是一个有效力的行动，是应该加以发展推进的。
    各位代表！
    在我们区域中所存在的武装干涉，现在还在继续着并且是在一天比一天更加剧烈地进行着。朝鲜人民在过去两年的时间中过着他们自己历史上最严重同时也是最光辉的日子；马来亚的战争已经延长到四年之久；高棉和寮国的战争已经将近七年了；越南的反侵略战争，已经进行了七年零十一天。
    这些武装干涉一天不停止，朝鲜、越南、寮国、高棉、马来亚的人民保卫自由独立的斗争也就一天不会结束。面对着这些由武装干涉带来的一天比一天更加野蛮的罪行，全世界人民都在大声疾呼，要求这些罪恶行为不能再继续发展下去，要求立刻停止这种非正义的战争。
    被侵略的各国的人民，自然不愿意战争，他们只是被迫不能不拿起武器来保卫自己的生存权利和民族独立。发动侵略战争的国家的人民，很久以来也一直在要求停止侵略战争了。
    主张侵略战争的人，只是一小撮而已，他们企图把一些国家的人民当作奴隶，企图发动第三次世界大战。
    一个民族的独立遭受了摧残，其他各民族的独立也就受到了威胁。那些正在继续进行着的武装干涉，正在威胁着共同的和平与安全；如果我们不加警惕，那些在局部地区燃烧着的战争火焰，就会很容易变成大规模的和全面的灾害。
    解决武装干涉的问题并不是各被干涉国家人民的个别的问题，而是全世界爱好和平人民所关心的问题。
    朝鲜代表已经根据朝鲜战争的特殊情况和它对今天国际形势所起的特殊影响，提出了关于解决朝鲜问题的具体建议。这个建议是符合于全世界爱好和平人民的意愿的。
    越南、寮国、高棉、马来亚等民族的民族独立问题，也曾多次为世界和平战士所提出。
    一九五一年在维也纳召开的世界和平理事会中，作出了关于解决越南及东南亚其他各地如寮国、高棉、马来亚等地武装冲突的决议；在郭沫若先生这次会议做的总报告里也已经提到了这个问题。这些民族的独立是保卫亚洲及太平洋区域与全世界和平的必要因素之一。
    亚洲及太平洋区域的人民必须要求：
    立刻停止在越南、寮国、高棉、马来亚等地所进行的武装干涉，一切外国军队必须撤离这些国家。
    民族独立的权利必须得到尊重，各国人民必须有权来自由处理自己的一切事务，不受任何国家的干涉。
    这些要求是符合各国人民的愿望，符合于联合国宪章所决定的民族自决的原则，符合于人类和各民族的神圣的自由平等的精神的。
    只有各个民族都获得独立，共同的和平与安全才能巩固。
    没有民族独立，在越南、寮国、高棉和马来亚等地不可能有真正的和平，没有民族独立也就不可能有世界的持久和平。
    亚洲、太平洋和全世界人民的和平意志，和正在为保卫自己的独立而斗争的各国人民争取独立的愿望，将使各个民族的独立获得保障。
    和平一定胜利。         （新华社）
