Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 29th: American military aircraft invading Korea bombed and strafed our Northeast Liaodong Province on October 26th, once again causing a serious tragedy of killing and wounding many of our civilians.

Eight American F-84 fighter planes invaded the airspace of Ji'an County, Liaodong Province, at 5:42 AM on the 26th, and at 5:47 AM invaded the airspace of Shihushang, conducting dive bombing and strafing, and dropping seven bombs, killing two of our civilians and wounding seventeen.

When the enemy planes ran rampant, our ground air defense forces launched fierce artillery fire at the enemy planes, shooting down one enemy plane. The pilot of the plane parachuted and landed, and was captured alive by our army. The captured pilot is named Lyle W. Cameron, 23 years old, residing at 5102 Garland St., Lincoln, Nebraska, U.S.A. He belongs to the 9th Squadron of the 49th Group of the U.S. Fifth Air Force, serving as a second lieutenant wingman pilot, with military number 23634A. The plane he was flying was an F-84 type, with tail number 439. He is a living witness to the U.S. Air Force's invasion of our country's airspace.

For more than two years, the American aggressors have repeatedly invaded our country's airspace, carrying out direct provocations. Recently, on the one hand, they unilaterally suspended negotiations, refused to resume negotiations, and continuously violated the Neutral Zone Agreement, taking various provocative actions against the Panmunjom conference area. On the other hand, they have been actively conspiring to use the United Nations General Assembly to prolong and expand the war of aggression. At this moment, the American aggressors have once again invaded our country's airspace, and deeply penetrated our inland areas to carry out indiscriminate bombing and strafing, killing and wounding many of our civilians. This clearly proves that the American imperialists are deliberately carrying out barbaric provocations against us, attempting to further create incidents and expand the war. The people of our country feel boundless anger and hatred for this kind of crazy provocative behavior by the American imperialists. The American aggressors must bear the inescapable responsibility for this provocative behavior.

    美机侵我东北领空杀伤和平居民
    我击落敌机一架活捉敌驾驶员
    【新华社沈阳二十九日电】美国侵朝军用飞机于十月二十六日侵入我国东北辽东省施行轰炸扫射，又一次造成杀伤我国平民多人的严重惨案。
    美国F—84战斗机八架在二十六日上午五时四十二分侵入我辽东省辑安县上空，五时四十七分侵入我石湖上空进行俯冲扫射，并投弹七枚，炸死我国平民二人，炸伤十七人。
    当敌机肆虐时，我地面防空部队向敌机发出猛烈炮火，击落敌机一架。该机驾驶员于跳伞降落后，已被我军生俘。该俘名叫拉尔·卡麦隆（LYLE．W．CAMERON）今年二十三岁，家住美国内布拉斯加州林肯城加蓝得街五一○二号（5102,GARLAND ST.LINCOLN,NEBRASKA,U.S.A）现属美第五航空队第四十九大队第九中队，任少尉僚机驾驶员，军号二三六三四A。他所驾的飞机为F—84型机，机号四三九。他是美国空军侵犯我国领空的活的见证。
    两年多以来美国侵略军曾多次侵入我国领空，进行直接挑衅。最近，他们一方面片面中止谈判，拒绝恢复谈判，并连续破坏中立区协议，对板门店会场区采取各种挑衅行为，另一方面又极力阴谋利用联合国大会来延长并扩大侵略战争。正在这个时候，美国侵略军竟再次侵入我国领空，并深入我内地肆行轰炸扫射，杀伤我国平民多人。这显然证明美帝国主义者蓄意对我进行野蛮挑衅，企图借此进一步制造事件，扩大战争。对于美帝国主义者这种疯狂挑衅行为，我全国人民感到无比愤怒，无比仇恨。美国侵略者必须对于这种挑衅行为负起无可逃避的责任。
