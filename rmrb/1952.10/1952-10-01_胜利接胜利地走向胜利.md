    Victory After Victory Leads to Victory
    Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy
    Marxism-Leninism, which applies universally, is invariably victorious because it conforms to the universal truth of the interests of all mankind. It has been fully proven by the victory of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union and its brilliant achievements over the past thirty-five years; it has been fully proven by the establishment and development of the People's Democratic countries in Eastern Europe; it has been fully proven by the victory of the anti-aggression wars of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; it has been even more fully proven by the emergence and growth of the People's Republic of China, which we ourselves are proud of. In 1949, the Communist Party of China, after only twenty-eight years since its establishment, completely liberated a China that had been sinking into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society with approximately 9.6 million square kilometers of land and 475 million people, and established a new China, which was an unprecedented historical victory. Only three years after this new country was born, it not only stood up like an adult but also did things that ordinary adults could not do. Such a great victory could not have been achieved without a people's revolution led by the working class armed with Marxism-Leninism.
    Victory continues to follow victory. The disasters inflicted on the Chinese people by long-term feudal oppression and a hundred years of imperialist oppression are profound. What the Kuomintang reactionary rule left behind was a country with a backward economy, culture, and everything else. Anyone would be anxious for the new China receiving such a legacy. But we have an incomparably sharp weapon, which is Mao Zedong Thought, the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the actual situation of the Chinese revolution. Our leader, Chairman Mao, and the Communist Party of China have used this weapon to achieve great achievements of victory after victory in three years.
    First of all, in terms of national defense: We strengthened the people's own People's Liberation Army from the People's Liberation War; the quality of the People's Liberation Army has been praised by the world, and its tactics have been admired by the world. Now our army's equipment is also strong, and we are building a strong people's navy and air force.
    The Chinese people love peace. We wrote in the Common Program: "Strive for… peace…"; and also wrote: "...to ensure lasting world peace." Although we have a strong people's liberation army of army, air force, and navy, we use it to defend ourselves; to resist aggression; and never to invade others. Because the Chinese people recognize on the basis of Marxism-Leninism that aggression is self-destruction, and that only by building a socialist society and living peacefully with the people of the world is the righteous path for mankind. We believe in Marxism-Leninism, we are experimenters of Mao Zedong Thought, we do not have the brand of the word "aggression" in our minds, we only firmly oppose aggression, and firmly strive for peace. However, before the aggressors repent, our national defense should be strong enough to defend our peaceful life. We already have a strong national defense construction to protect peace, which is a great victory following the national liberation.
    Secondly, we want to be close friends with all mankind—the people of the whole world; more than sixty fraternal ethnic groups in our country have truly become as close as brothers in a big family. We must strive to make the people of the world brothers. Because the new China has gained the trust of the people of the world, we are currently hosting the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The fact that this conference is considered suitable to be held in China symbolizes that the power of peace is flourishing, like the sun rising higher and higher from the east; the maintenance of lasting world peace is entirely possible. This should be said to be a determined victory.
    Third, the diplomatic victory of the new China is first manifested in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in 1950; the alliance between the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union laid the cornerstone for defending the Far East and world peace. The People's Democratic countries in Eastern Europe that have established diplomatic relations with us have successively signed cultural agreements with us. These agreements fully demonstrate the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance. We have continuously exchanged cultural delegations, performing arts troupes, acrobatic troupes, etc. with them; we have exchanged cultural gifts; and what is particularly worth mentioning is the exchange of professors and the assignment of students, which are opening a new era in history. Such people's diplomacy is also a diplomacy of common victory.
    Fourth, the foundation of our new country is very solid. As people's political power organizations at all levels have been established throughout the country, the people's democratic system has been automatically implemented by the people. Regarding national and local affairs, the people earnestly put forward their own opinions; in their own meetings, there are often tens of thousands of proposals; this shows that they have truly gained freedom; it shows that the people are truly powerful. After the land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the people have a more intimate understanding of their relationship with the country; they also have a concrete understanding of the superiority of the people's democratic dictatorship in the new democratic stage.
    The nature of society has changed, the nature of the country has changed, and we are creating our own people's laws in practice. In addition to the fundamental law—the Common Program—we have now formulated the Trade Union Law, the Marriage Law, the Land Reform Law, the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, the Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption, the Labor Insurance Regulations, the Agricultural Tax, the Industrial and Commercial Tax Regulations and many important regulations and rules; the new national legal system is gradually being perfected. In terms of administrative supervision, we have supervision committees at all levels from the central to the local level, and there are also supervision correspondents in various state organs, all of whom have independent powers. The people can report the dereliction of duty of administrative staff to the supervisory organs. This also plays a great role in consolidating our political power.
    The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements officially began in January of this year. This is a serious political struggle following the three major movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. It is also a major movement of social reform. This movement is not only necessary for laying a good foundation for the development of construction after the improvement of finance and economy; it is also necessary for consolidating our people's democratic dictatorship and accelerating the construction of our new democracy.
    The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have yielded great results, that is, they have initially transformed the thinking of state workers, cleared away the five poisonous thoughts of illegal bourgeois elements, defended the Common Program, and further consolidated the leading position of the working class. This is a great victory.
    Fifth, regarding finance and economy: On June 6, 1950, Chairman Mao made a report on "Strive for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation" at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In his report, he mentioned that "the People's Government has realized unified management and unified leadership of national financial and economic work within the recent months, strived for a balance of financial revenue and expenditure, stopped inflation, and stabilized prices." He also made the conclusion: "The batch of victories we have now achieved on the economic front… shows the beginning of the improvement in the financial and economic situation." He also pointed out: "To achieve a fundamental turn for the better in the financial and economic situation, three conditions are needed, namely: (1) the completion of land reform; (2) the rational adjustment of existing industry and commerce; (3) a substantial reduction in the expenses required by state organs." He also said: "I and everyone believe that these conditions can be achieved with complete certainty in about three years. By then, we can see the fundamental improvement of the entire financial and economic situation of our country." The timetable set by Chairman Mao is accurate, only two years and three months from the time he spoke to the present. Not only has our country's finance balanced its revenue and expenditure, but there is also a surplus; this year, the agricultural surcharge has been completely exempted. This is one side of the financial victory.
    Due to Chairman Mao's call to "Strive for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation," everyone regards improving labor productivity as their constant central task. No matter in which aspect, labor models continue to emerge; not only learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, but also creating many new working methods. Therefore, industrial and agricultural production have made significant progress. The brilliant achievements in the economic field over the past three years are unprecedented.
    Sixth, "With the advent of the high tide in economic construction, a high tide in cultural construction will inevitably appear;" this is what Chairman Mao instructed us to prepare for. Facts have proved that in the past three years, the economy has not only recovered but also developed; therefore, the education cause, which mainly serves economic construction, has developed significantly and rapidly year by year with the development of economic construction. Three major events closely related to economic construction are: (1) In October 1951, the State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Decision on Reforming the School System," abolishing the old school system that served the bourgeoisie and establishing a new school system that serves the people. The characteristics of this school system are: (1) to serve the working class, peasants, and the masses, so that they and their children can have the right to education; (2) schools at all levels and types are convenient for the working class, peasants, and the masses to receive education, so that they are interconnected and communicated, and there can be many paths to the university; (3) professional education is determined to supply the talents needed for national construction; (4) The six-year two-level primary school system has been changed to a five-year consistent system, so that children of urban and rural people can also receive complete primary education. In order to implement the new school system to meet the needs of economic construction, we have carried out the adjustment of departments and faculties of universities and specialized colleges. (2) Due to the invention of Qi Jianhua's rapid literacy method, we are using it to train teachers to eliminate illiteracy. We have boldly put forward the slogan of eliminating illiteracy. We plan to eliminate 14 million illiterate people this winter and spring based on preliminary experience; (3) Ideological transformation; Chairman Mao said: "Ideological transformation, first of all, the ideological transformation of various intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reform and gradually implement industrialization in all aspects." The ideological transformation of teachers at all levels of schools is the main condition for teaching students well; at the end of autumn in 1951, we carried out ideological transformation among teachers in universities, and due to the promotion of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the ideological transformation movement was generally carried out, and the thinking of teachers has generally improved.
    Culture, science, and health: Due to the improvement of people's lives after liberation, whether in urban or rural areas, people have cultural and entertainment needs; literature, art, science, technology, drama, movies, and slides are urgently needed by them. In 1951, the national movie audience reached 360 million person-times; among them, the audience of projection teams in factories, rural areas, and troops was about 140 million person-times. Excellent people's movies are warmly welcomed by the masses. At the 5th and 6th International Film Festival competitions, our films such as "Daughters of China" and "Steel Soldiers" received awards. Our cultural and art troupes and acrobatic troupes have also received awards abroad. The old operas that are loved by the vast masses have been somewhat innovated under the correct policy of the people's government's opera reform. Science has been combined with practice to serve economic construction, and considerable discoveries have been made in resource surveys. Under the correct policy of "prevention first," the health cause has reduced the prevalence of epidemics year by year, and cleanliness has made remarkable achievements. These are all victorious achievements on our cultural front.
    The great victories we have achieved on various fronts in the past three years have been achieved by the people's government led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China correctly implementing the Common Program. All the work of building the motherland in the past three years has been carried out in accordance with the Common Program under Chairman Mao's bright vision and decisive decision. If we comprehensively and correctly study the Common Program, we can not only understand that all "step-by-step" work is implementing the policies stipulated in the Common Program, but also feel that prominent movements such as resisting America and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, "loyalty and honesty," and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, if we look for the basis in the Common Program, there are clear regulations. Because some of us have not studied enough, we neither closely link the Common Program with our own work, nor do we look at the various chapters and articles of the Common Program in isolation, or take the attitude of "not seeking thorough understanding"; or after reading it, we do not deeply appreciate it; then naturally it is not easy to understand why certain things are necessary to do, and why certain things are not done earlier, not done later, but must be done at this time and other truths. If we study the Common Program deeply, if we study the Common Program in connection with "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," we should "suddenly understand." Because the Common Program is a concrete manifestation of Mao Zedong Thought. "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" are important developments of Mao Zedong Thought on dialectical materialism.
    The achievements of victory after victory obtained in the past three years are the glory of our people, and this glory should be attributed to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. How do we continuously develop victory? We can only work together to study Mao Zedong Thought, study the Common Program, and strive to thoroughly implement the Common Program.
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

    胜利接胜利地走向胜利
    中国民主促进会主席  马叙伦
    放之四海而皆准的马列主义，是无往而不胜利的，因为它是符合于全人类利益的普遍真理。它在苏联十月革命的胜利和它三十五年来的辉煌成就上完全证明了；它在东欧人民民主国家的成立和发展上完全证明了；它在朝鲜、越南民主共和国的反侵略战争胜利上完全证明了；它在值得我们自己骄傲的中华人民共和国的产生和成长上更完全证明了。一九四九年，中国共产党的建立才二十八年，已把一个沉沦为半殖民地半封建社会的而拥有约九百六十万平方公里土地、四亿七千五百万人民的中国完全解放，成立了新的中国，已是一个空前的历史胜利；在这一新国家呱呱坠地后才三足岁，它不但和成人一般地站了起来，它还做了一般成人所不能做到的事情。这不是以马列主义武装起来的工人阶级领导的人民革命，决不能取得这样伟大的胜利。
    胜利还是接着胜利来的。长期的封建压迫和一百年帝国主义压迫所给中国人民的灾难是深重的。国民党反动统治所留下来的是一个经济、文化和一切都落后的国家。新中国得到这样遗产，任何人都在为它焦心。但我们有一个犀利无比的武器，就是马列主义与中国革命实际结合的毛泽东思想，我们中国人民的领袖毛主席和中国共产党运用了这个武器，就在三年中取得了胜利接着胜利的伟大成就。
    首先是国防方面：我们从人民解放战争中壮大了人民自己的人民解放军；人民解放军的品质，已为世界所称道，战术也为世界所惊奇。现在我国陆军的装备也强盛了，我们正建设着强大的人民海军和空军。
    中国人民是爱好和平的，我们在共同纲领上写着：“为……和平……而奋斗”；又写着：“……以保障世界的持久和平。”我们虽然有了强大的人民解放军的陆军、空军和海军，我们用来保卫自己；用来抵抗侵略；决不用来侵略别人。因为中国人民都在马列主义基础上认识到侵略是毁灭自己，只有自己建设社会主义的社会，和世界人民一道和平共处，是人类正义的生路。我们是相信马列主义的，我们是毛泽东思想的实验者，我们头脑上没有侵略这个名词的烙印，我们只有坚决反对侵略，又坚决争取和平。但是，在侵略者还未悔悟以前，我们的国防是应该强大到足以保卫自己的和平生活的。我们已有强大的保卫和平的国防建设，这是接着全国解放的一个大胜利。
    其次，我们是要和全人类——全世界人民做亲密的朋友的；我们国内六十个以上的兄弟民族，已真正亲密得和大家庭里的同胞兄弟一样。我们必须争取到世界人民都是兄弟般的朋友。由于新中国已取得世界人民的相信，我们正在目前做了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的东道主。这个会议的被认为适宜在中国召开，就象征了和平的力量正方兴未艾，像太阳正从东方步步高升；世界持久和平的保持是完全可能的。这应该说是一个已确定了的胜利。
    第三，新中国的外交胜利，首先表现在一九五○年的中苏友好同盟互助条约；中苏两大国的同盟给保卫远东及世界和平奠定了基石。和我们建立了邦交的东欧各人民民主国家，都先后和我们订立了文化协定。这些协定，充分表现了友好互助的精神。我们和它们不断地互派了文化考察团、文工团、杂技团等；互相致送了文化礼物；尤其值得提出的，还交换了教授，交派了留学生，这都是开历史的新纪元的。这样的人民外交，也是共同胜利的外交。
    第四，我们新国家的基础是很巩固的。由于全国各级人民政权机构都已成立，人民民主制度已由人民自动执行。有关国家和地方的事情，人民都认真地提出自己的意见；在他们自己的会议上，提案有的多到万件以上；这表现了他们真正得到了自由；表现了人民真正是有力量的。在经过土地改革、镇压反革命、“三反”、“五反”运动后，人民更亲切地认识了他们和国家的关系；他们对人民民主专政在新民主主义阶段的优越性，也有了具体的了解。
    社会性质改变了，国家性质改变了，我们正在实际体验中创造我们人民自己的法律。我们现在除了根本法——共同纲领外，已制定了工会法、婚姻法、土地改革法、惩治反革命条例、惩治贪污条例、劳动保险条例、农业税、工商业税条例和许多重要的条例、规章；新国家法律制度，已在逐渐完备中。在行政的监察方面，我们有从中央到地方的各级监察委员会，各国家机关中还有监察通讯员，都有独立的职权。人民都可以向监察机关揭发行政工作人员的失职行为。这也对于巩固我们政权有很大
    的作用。
    本年一月正式开始了“三反”、“五反”运动，这是接着抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动后的一个严肃的政治斗争，也是一个社会改革的重大运动。这一运动不仅是财政、经济好转后，为发展建设打下一个良好基础有此必要；为了巩固我们的人民民主专政，加速我们新民主主义的建设也有此必要。
    “三反”、“五反”运动有了很大的收获，就是初步改造了国家工作人员的思想，清除了资产阶级不法分子的五毒思想，保卫了共同纲领，进一步巩固了工人阶级的领导地位。这是一个很大的胜利。
    第五，关于财政经济方面：在一九五○年六月六日，毛主席在中国共产党第七届第三次中央全体会议上作了“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”的报告，他在报告中提到“人民政府在最近几个月内实现了全国范围内的财政经济工作的统一管理和统一领导，争取了财政的收支平衡，制止了通货膨胀、稳定了物价。”他还作了：“我们现在在经济战线上已经取得的一批胜利……表现了财政经济情况的开始好转”的结论。他还指出：“要获得财政经济情况的根本好转，需要三个条件，即：（一）土地改革的完成；（二）现有工商业的合理调整；（三）国家机构所需经费的大量节减。”他又说：“我和大家都相信，这些条件是完全有把握地能够在三年左右的时间内争取其实现的。到了那时，我们就可以看见我们国家整个财政经济状况的根本好转了。”毛主席定的时间表是准确的，从他说话的时候到现在，只有两年零三个多月。我们国家的财政，不但收支已平衡了，还有多余；今年农业附加税已全部免征。这是财政胜利的一面。
    由于毛主席的“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”的号召，每个人将提高劳动生产力作为自己经常的中心任务。不论在那一方面，劳动模范不断地出现；不但学习苏联的先进经验，而且创造了许多新的工作方法。所以，工业、农业生产都有显著的进步。经济方面三年来获得的辉煌成就，是史无前例的。
    第六，“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮；”这是毛主席指示我们要作准备的话。事实证明，三年来经济方面，不但恢复，还在发展；所以主要的为经济建设服务的教育事业，很显著地逐年随着经济建设的发展而迅速发展。密切与经济建设有关的三件大事是：（一）一九五一年十月，中央人民政府政务院公布了“关于改革学制的决定”，废除了旧的为资产阶级服务的学制，建立了新的为人民服务的学制。这学制的特点：（1）为工农人民大众服务，使他们和他们的子女都可以有受教育的权利；（2）各级各类学校都为便利工农大众得受教育，使它们互相衔接、沟通，可以条条大路通大学；（3）确定了专业教育，为国家建设供应需要的人才。（4）把六年两级制的小学改为五年一贯制，使城乡人民的子女同样可以受到完全的初等教育。我们为了执行新学制来配合经济建设的需要，已进行了大学和专门学院学校的院系、科系调整。（二）由于祁建华速成识字法的发明，我们已在用它来训练扫除文盲的师资，我们已大胆提出了扫除文盲的口号，我们计划根据初步经验，在今冬和明春扫除一千四百万的文盲；（三）思想改造；毛主席说：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之
    一。”各级学校教师的思想改造，是教好学生的主要条件；我们在一九五一年的秋末，就在高等学校的教师方面，进行思想改造，又由于“三反”、“五反”运动的推动，思想改造运动的普遍进行，教师的思想一般都有所提高了。
    文化、科学、卫生方面：由于解放后人民生活的改进，不论城乡，人民都有文化、娱乐的要求；文艺、科学、技术、戏剧、电影、幻灯，都为他们所迫切需要。一九五一全国电影观众达三亿六千万人次；其中工厂、农村、部队的放映队观众约一亿四千万人次。优秀的人民电影，受到人民群众的热烈欢迎。在第五和第六届国际电影节比赛会上，我们的“中华女儿”、“钢铁战士”等片得到奖状。我们的文工团、杂技团也在国外得到奖誉。为广大群众所喜爱的旧戏曲，在人民政府戏曲改革的正确政策下已得一定的革新。科学已与实际结合，为经济建设服务，资源勘测，有了相当的发现。卫生事业在以“预防为主”的正确方针下，使流行疫症，逐年减少，清洁有了显著的成绩。这都是我们文化阵线上的胜利成果。
    我们三年来在各个战线上的伟大胜利，是由毛主席和中国共产党所领导的人民政府正确执行共同纲领而取得的。三年来建设祖国的一切工作，都是按照共同纲领在毛主席光烛远见、当机立断下进行。我们如果全面地、正确地学习了共同纲领，不但可以了解一切“按步就班”的工作，都是在执行共同纲领规定的政策，就是觉得突出的如抗美援朝、镇压反革命、“忠诚老实”、“三反”、“五反”各种运动，我们如果向共同纲领里去找寻根据，都有明白的规定。由于我们中有些人学习不够，既不把共同纲领和自己工作紧密地联系起来，又把共同纲领的各章各条孤立地来看，或者拿了“不求甚解”的态度去看；或者看过了不去深切地体会；那自然就不容易了解某些事情为什么必要做，某些事情为什么不早做，不迟做，而一定要在这个时候做等等道理。我们如果把共同纲领深切研究一下，如果把共同纲领和“实践论”、“矛盾论”联系起来研究，我们该会“豁然贯通”。因为共同纲领是毛泽东思想的具体表现。“实践论”和“矛盾论”则是毛泽东思想对于辩证唯物论的重要发展。
    三年来得到的胜利接着胜利的成就，是我们全国人民的光荣，这个光荣该归于毛主席和中国共产党。我们怎样不断地发展胜利呢？我们只有一齐来努力学习毛泽东思想，学习共同纲领，为彻底实现共同纲领而奋斗。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！    
    中国人民伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
