    Suggestion to Use "Road Paving and Water Blocking" Method to Improve Low-Lying Sloping Land
    Editor: There are many low-lying sloping areas in the North China Plain. In years with little rain, crops in the low-lying areas can grow well, but the sloping areas suffer from drought. In years with abundant rain, crops in the sloping areas can grow well, but the low-lying areas suffer from flooding. Therefore, in these areas, drought and flood disasters occur year after year. It is necessary to change this situation to ensure that crops in these areas achieve high yields. The method devised by farmers in the Nanwang Lake area of Nanwang County in the North China Plain to change this situation is, in my opinion, worth promoting. The Nanwang Lake area is also low-lying and sloping, higher in the east and lower in the west. Every year, there is a lot of rain in summer and autumn, the sloping land is eroded by water, and the soil becomes hard. The low-lying areas accumulate water into channels, forming Nanwang Lake. Only after the lake water dries up in autumn can farmers take the opportunity to plant a season of wheat. Later, some farmers raised the roads on the east and west sides of their fields to block the water flowing down from the slopes, and at the same time block the water in their own fields to prevent it from flowing outwards, and tried to level the land. In this way, they could also sow seeds in the spring, and the seedlings grew well.
    Farmers in North China say, "Heavenly rain cannot drown crops," meaning that the rainfall in North China is basically not enough for crops, only low-lying areas near slopes are prone to waterlogging. Therefore, in the low-lying sloping areas of North China, if the "road paving and water blocking" method of Nanwang Lake can be adopted, the fields can be filled and raised in sections according to the natural terrain, separated into squares, so that the low-lying areas can be planted year-round, and the water on the sloping land can also be retained. This can change the situation where low-lying sloping land either suffers from floods or droughts.

### 建议用“垫路挡水”办法修整洼坡地

    建议用“垫路挡水”办法修整洼坡地
    编辑同志：华北平原有不少洼坡地区，雨少年份，洼地作物能够长好，但坡地要闹旱灾；雨多年份，坡地作物能够长好，但洼地要闹水灾。因此，这些地区，旱灾水灾连年不断。必须改变这种情况，才能保证这些地区的农作物得到丰产。平原南旺县南旺湖一带的农民想出的改变这种情况的办法，我认为是值得推广的。南旺湖一带也是洼坡地，东高西低。每年夏秋雨水多，坡地被水冲刷，土壤变硬；洼地积水成渠，形成南旺湖。只在秋后湖水干涸时，农民才能乘隙种上一季小麦。后来有些农民把自己田地东西两头的道路垫高，挡住坡上流下的水，同时挡住自己地里的水，使其不向外流，并设法把地整平。这样，春季也能下种了，苗也长得好。
    华北地区的农民说：“天落雨淹不死庄稼”，意思是华北地区的雨水基本上不够庄稼需要，只有临坡洼地，容易积水成灾。因此，在华北的洼坡地区，如能采取南旺湖“垫路挡水”办法，按照自然地势，有计划地把田地分段填高，隔成方格，洼地就可常年种植，坡地的水也可以保持。这就可以改变洼坡地不是闹水灾就是闹旱灾的情况。
