Xinhua News Agency, October 17th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Yoshida government formally reorganized the core of the new Japanese army—the so-called "Police Reserve Force"—into the "Security Force" on the 15th. This is a prelude to the Yoshida government's open and large-scale rebuilding of the Japanese aggressor army.

The so-called "Police Reserve Force" was established by the Yoshida government under the orders of the United States in July 1950, after the latter launched the war of aggression against Korea. At that time, the "Police Reserve Force" had a total of 75,000 personnel, and was organized into four divisions modeled after the U.S. Army. In the two years since, with the support of the United States, the "Police Reserve Force" has expanded to 110,000 people, and is preparing to further expand to 180,000, and even 320,000, in accordance with U.S. instructions. The "Police Reserve Force" not only wears American-style uniforms and receives training from U.S. military "advisors," but also is equipped with American "leased" weapons—light and heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, mortars, heavy artillery, and tanks. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are also actively planning to equip the "Security Force" with aircraft. An aviation school will soon open at the former site of the Japanese Army Aviation School near Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, to train new air force personnel. The Yoshida government is also calculating to allocate a huge sum of 100 billion yen to the "Security Force" and the "Maritime Safety Force" in the next fiscal year to expand their strength. These measures by Japan to actively restore militarist aggression are only a beginning. Yoshida publicly announced on the eve of the general election (September 28) that in the next four years, he will devote himself to "restoring national power" and rearming.

Facts show that the establishment of the "Police Reserve Force" and the "Security Force" is by no means for the genuine self-defense needs of Japan, but to restore the aggressive Japanese army and establish an American mercenary force. Japanese Prime Minister and concurrently "Director-General of the Security Agency" Yoshida arrogantly said to the personnel of the "Security Agency" on August 4: The "Police Reserve Force" should become the "backbone of the new national army" of Japan, and "the United States hopes that the Japanese people will lead Asia." In the ceremony of reorganizing the "Police Reserve Force" into the "Security Force," he also delivered a speech entitled "The Determination of the New National Army," continuing to advocate militarism. Kyodo News Agency Tokyo, October 12 dispatch, when talking about "whether the Security Force will be changed into a defense force," quoted "political observers" as saying: "The United States believes that Japan's defense (!) is part of its Far East operation plan and hopes that Japan has its own defense force."

### 吉田政府重建侵略军的前奏  “警察后备队”改编为“保安队”

    吉田政府重建侵略军的前奏
    “警察后备队”改编为“保安队”
    【新华社十七日讯】东京消息：日本吉田政府在十五日正式把日本新陆军的核心——所谓“警察后备队”改编为“保安队”，这是吉田政府公开大规模重建日本侵略军队的前奏。
    所谓“警察后备队”是美国在发动侵朝战争之后，于一九五○年七月间命令吉田政府建立的。在当时“警察后备队”共有兵员七万五千人，仿照美国陆军的编制组成了四个师。两年以来，在美国的扶植之下，“警察后备队”已经扩充为十一万人，并且准备遵照美国的指令再扩充为十八万人，以至三十二万人。“警察后备队”不但穿着美国式的制服和受着美军“顾问”的训练，并且装备着美国“租借”的武器——轻重机关枪、火箭炮、迫击炮、重炮以及坦克。美、日反动派也正在积极进行使“保安队”装备飞机的计划。一所航空学校即将在静冈县滨松附近的前日本陆军航空学校的旧址开学，以训练新的空军人员。吉田政府并在计算在下一个会计年度中拨给“保安队”和“海上警备队”以一千亿日元的巨款，来扩充它们的实力。日本这种积极恢复军国主义侵略势力的措施，还仅是一个开端。吉田已经在大选的前夕（九月二十八日）公开宣布，在今后的四年中，他将致力于“恢复国力”，重整军备。
    事实说明，“警察后备队”以及“保安队”的建立，绝不是为了日本的真正自卫的需要，而是为了恢复侵略性的日本陆军和建立美国的雇佣兵团。日本首相兼“保安厅”长官吉田于八月四日曾经对“保安厅”的人员狂妄地说：“警察后备队”要成为日本“新国军的骨干”，“美国希望领导亚洲的是日本国民”。他在“警察后备队”改编为“保安队”的仪式中，又发表以“新国军的决心”为题的演说，继续鼓吹黩武主义。共同社东京十月十二日电在谈到“保安队是否将改变为国防军”时，引“政治观察家”的谈话说：“美国认为日本的防御（！）是它的远东作战计划的一部分，并希望日本有它自己的国防军。”
