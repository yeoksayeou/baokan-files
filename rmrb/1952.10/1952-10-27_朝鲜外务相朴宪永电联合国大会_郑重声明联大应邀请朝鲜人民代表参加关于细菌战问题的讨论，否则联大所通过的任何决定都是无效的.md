Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 25th—Pak Hon-yong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, telegraphed Pearson, President of the United Nations General Assembly, on the 24th regarding the issue of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly discussing an on-site investigation into the facts of bacteriological warfare. The telegram is as follows:

    The fact that the American interventionists used bacteriological weapons in North Korea has long been confirmed by authoritative international investigation teams such as the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and the International Scientific Committee for Investigating the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China, as well as Chinese bacteriological experts, and the confessions of captured American pilots who directly participated in the bacteriological warfare against our peace-loving people. According to reports, the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly has disregarded this and, on October 21, under the coercion of representatives of the American government, discussed the issue of conducting an on-site investigation into the circumstances of the American interventionists' use of bacteriological weapons.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea hereby authorizes me to make the following statement to you regarding the United Nations General Assembly's illegal and unilateral discussion of the issue of investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare without inviting the true representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate:

    The rejection of the proposal of the Soviet representative, which conforms to the interests of our people and all peace-loving people in the world, shows that some countries, ignoring the legitimate rights representing the vital interests of the Korean people, attempt to discuss the Korean issue at future sessions of the United Nations General Assembly without the participation of the true representatives of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, representing the will of the entire people, requests that you invite representatives of our people to participate in the current United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the situation of the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea, so that representatives of our people can once again prove to the members of the United Nations General Assembly the fact that the American interventionists are using bacteriological weapons in our country.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly declared, and hereby declares once again, that the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people will never recognize any decision adopted by the United Nations General Assembly without the participation of representatives of the Korean people, and such decisions will be deemed invalid.

    I request Your Excellency the President to inform all member states of the United Nations of this statement.

    Pak Hon-yong
    Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    Pyongyang, Korea, October 24, 1952

    朝鲜外务相朴宪永电联合国大会
    郑重声明联大应邀请朝鲜人民代表参加关于细菌战问题的讨论，否则联大所通过的任何决定都是无效的
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永在二十四日就联合国第七届大会讨论对细菌战事实进行实地调查问题一事致电联合国大会主席皮尔逊。电文如下：
    美国干涉者在北朝鲜使用细菌武器的事实，在很久以前就已经由国际民主法律工作者协会调查团和调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会等有权威的国际调查团与中国细菌学专家们以及直接参加细菌战反对我们爱好和平的人民的战俘美国驾驶员的供词所证实。根据报道：联合国第七届大会竟对此置于不顾，而在十月二十一日在美国政府代表们的强制下，讨论了为调查美国干涉者使用细菌武器的情形进行实地调查的问题。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府特授权本人就联合国大会没有邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的真正代表参加而非法地片面地讨论关于调查细菌战事实的问题向你作如下的声明：
    符合我们人民和全世界一切爱好和平人民利益的苏联代表的提议之被否决，表明某些国家无视代表朝鲜人民切身利益的合法权利，企图在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的真正代表的参加下，在今后的联合国大会上讨论朝鲜问题。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表全体人民的意志，要求你邀请我们人民的代表参加目前联合国大会关于在朝鲜使用细菌武器的情况的讨论，让我们人民的代表，在联合国大会的会员们面前，再一次证明美国干涉者在我们国家使用细菌武器的事实。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾屡次声明，兹特再一次声明：联合国大会在没有朝鲜人民代表参加的情形下所通过的任何决定，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全朝鲜人民都决不予以承认，那样的决定将被认为是无效的。
    我要求主席阁下将此项声明告知全体联合国会员国。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相　朴宪永
    一九五二年十月二十四日朝鲜平壤
