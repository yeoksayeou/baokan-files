The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Congratulatory Telegram to General Kim Il-sung

Respected General Kim Il-sung:

Under your wise leadership, the heroic Korean People's Army, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese People's Volunteers, is striking at the common enemy. For two years, you have defeated the invading forces of more than a dozen countries headed by US imperialism and the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang, putting US imperialism in a dilemma and effectively safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. This great victory has given powerful encouragement to the people of the world who are fighting for peace, independence, and freedom. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers going abroad to fight, we, the literary and art workers of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, extend our brotherly greetings to you, and through you to the heroic Korean People's Army and the Korean people!

China and Korea are as closely related as lips and teeth, and the people of China and Korea have a traditional friendship in history. This friendship has become even closer because the armies of our two countries are fighting against the enemy together and have achieved brilliant victories; this friendship cannot be destroyed by any violence; this friendship is a powerful guarantee for continuing to smash the invaders' conspiracies and thoroughly defeat US imperialism.

Respected comrades, the Chinese people are connected with you heart to heart. When your good news arrives, all the Chinese people are jubilant and encouraged. We literary and art workers will, like the people of our country, do our best to use literary and artistic weapons to redouble our efforts to support you. We will fight to the end for our common goal—striving for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis, and realizing peace in Asia and the world.

Long live the great friendship between the people of Korea and China!

The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce's Congratulatory Telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteers

Commander Peng Dehuai and all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Volunteers going abroad to fight, we, on behalf of all industrialists and businessmen in the motherland, extend our highest respect and most cordial greetings to the Volunteer comrades who, together with the Korean People's Army, have established immortal feats for the independence and freedom of Korea, the security of our motherland, and the peace of Asia and the world.

In the past two years, your heroic and outstanding struggle has disrupted the US imperialists' criminal invasion plan, forced their bloody hands back to the south of the 38th parallel, and provided a more reliable guarantee for the motherland's construction and the happy life of the people of the motherland; it has greatly encouraged the common aspiration of the people of the world to safeguard peace. In the past two years, the great achievements in the motherland's economic construction and the unprecedented development of industrial and commercial enterprises have been inseparable from your brilliant victories. We, all industrialists and businessmen, guarantee to respond with the highest enthusiasm to Chairman Mao's great call to increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, closely cooperate with the needs of the front and the rear, and contribute all our strength to further prosper the motherland's economy and welcome the upcoming large-scale national construction.

We express our infinite indignation at the US aggressors' inhuman bacteriological warfare and their shameless acts of attempting to forcibly detain prisoners of war and announcing an indefinite suspension of the Korean armistice negotiations; we fully support the reasonable proposal put forward by Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to resume armistice negotiations. We also guarantee to support your just struggle with practical actions of high patriotism and internationalism, so that the Korean issue can be resolved on a fair and reasonable basis as soon as possible.

We wish you to create greater victories and wish you good health.

The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce's Congratulatory Telegram to General Kim Il-sung

Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, General Kim Il-sung:

As our Chinese people warmly celebrate the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers going abroad to fight, we, on behalf of all Chinese industrialists and businessmen, extend our brotherly concern and cordial greetings to you, and through you to the heroic Korean nation and its heroic armed forces, and pay our highest respect.

For two years, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, under your unified command, have won great victories. These victories have not only defended the national independence of the Korean people and the security of China, but also strengthened the confidence of the oppressed people in resisting aggression and encouraged the will of the people of the world to strive for peace, thus guaranteeing that peace will surely prevail. We are proud of the heroism of our brother country, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; we feel great honor to be able to send our best sons and daughters to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army!

The people of China and Korea have a long history and an unbreakable friendship. We will always stand firmly together to jointly resist the enemies who harm peace. We, all Chinese industrialists and businessmen, will resolutely continue to support the just struggle of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers with practical actions in various ways, until this struggle is victoriously concluded and the Korean issue is peacefully resolved.

Long live the friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea forged with flesh and blood!

Long live the victory of the people of China and Korea in resisting the common enemy!

    英雄的朝鲜人民军在您的英明领导下，与我国人民志愿军并肩作战，打击着共同的敌人。两年来已经打败了以美帝国主义为首的十多个国家的侵略军与李承晚匪帮，使美帝国主义陷于进退维谷的境地，有效地保卫了远东与世界的和平。这种伟大的胜利，给全世界为和平、独立、自由而斗争的人民以有力的鼓舞。现当中国人民志愿军出国作战两周年之际，我们中华全国文学艺术工作者们，特向您，并通过您向英雄的朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民致以兄弟的敬礼！
    中朝两国是唇齿相依的，中朝人民在历史上有传统的友谊。这种友谊由于我们两国人民的军队共同抗击着敌人，并取得辉煌胜利而更加亲密；这种友谊是任何暴力也不能摧毁的；这种友谊正是继续粉碎侵略者的谋阴与彻底战胜美帝国主义的有力的保证。
    敬爱的同志们，中国人民和你们是心心相连的。当你们的捷报传来时，全中国人民莫不欢欣鼓舞。我们文艺工作者将和我国人民一样，将竭尽全力利用文艺武器来加倍努力支援你们。为了我们共同的目的——争取朝鲜问题在公平合理的基础上和平解决，实现亚洲及世界和平而奋斗到底。
