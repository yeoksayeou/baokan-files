Comrade A. I. Notkin,

I did not rush to reply because I considered the questions you raised not urgent. Moreover, there were other urgent matters that naturally diverted my attention from your letter.

I will respond point by point.

Regarding the first point.

In my "Opinions," there is a well-known principle: society is not powerless before scientific laws; people, having recognized the economic laws, can use them to benefit society. You assert that this principle cannot be applied to other social formations; it is only effective under the socialist and communist systems. For example, under the capitalist system, the spontaneous nature of the economic process would not allow society to use economic laws to benefit itself.

This is incorrect. During the bourgeois revolutions, for example in France, the bourgeoisie used the well-known law that production relations must correspond to the nature of the productive forces to oppose the feudal system, overthrow the feudal production relations, establish new bourgeois production relations, and make these relations correspond to the productive forces that had grown within the feudal system. The bourgeoisie achieved this not because of any special abilities but because they had a direct interest in it. The feudal lords resisted this not because of their stupidity but because they had a direct interest in obstructing the implementation of this law.

Regarding our socialist revolution, the same can be said. The working class used the law that production relations must correspond to the nature of the productive forces to overthrow the bourgeois production relations, establish new socialist production relations, and make these relations correspond to the nature of the productive forces. The working class was able to do this not because of any special abilities but because they had a direct interest in it. The bourgeoisie, which had become a counter-revolutionary force from the early stages of the bourgeois revolution, vigorously resisted the implementation of this law—not because of their lack of organization, nor because the spontaneous nature of the economic process drove them to resist, but mainly because they had a direct interest in opposing the implementation of this law.

From this, it follows:

1. To some extent, the use of the economic process and economic laws to benefit society occurs not only under the socialist and communist systems but also under other social formations.
2. In class societies, the use of economic laws is always class-based, and the standard-bearers of using economic laws to benefit society are always the progressive classes, while the decaying classes resist this.

In this regard, the difference between the proletariat and other classes that have historically carried out transformations of production relations is that the class interests of the proletariat are merged with the interests of the vast majority of society, because the proletarian revolution is not the elimination of one form of exploitation or another, but the elimination of any exploitation. As for the revolutions of other classes, they are only the elimination of one form of exploitation or another, and are limited by their narrow class interests that are in conflict with the interests of the vast majority of society.

In the "Opinions," it is mentioned that the use of economic laws to benefit society has a class background. It says: "In the natural sciences, the discovery and application of new laws proceed more or less smoothly; in contrast, in the field of economics, the discovery and application of new laws that violate the interests of the decaying forces of society encounter their strong resistance." But you did not pay attention to this.

Regarding the second point.

You assert that only under the socialist and communist systems can production relations fully correspond to the nature of the productive forces, while in other social formations, only partial correspondence is possible.

This is incorrect. After the bourgeois revolution, when the bourgeoisie destroyed the feudal production relations and established bourgeois production relations, there was undoubtedly a period when the bourgeois production relations fully corresponded to the nature of the productive forces. Otherwise, capitalism would not have developed as rapidly as it did after the bourgeois revolution.

Furthermore, the phrase "full correspondence" should not be understood in an absolute sense. It cannot be understood as if, under the socialist system, there would never be a phenomenon where production relations lag behind the growth of productive forces. Productive forces are the most active and revolutionary force in production. This force, even under the socialist system, undoubtedly moves ahead of production relations. Production relations are only adjusted after some time to correspond to the nature of the productive forces.

So, how should the phrase "full correspondence" be understood? It should be understood that under the socialist system, production relations usually do not conflict with productive forces, and society has the ability to timely adjust lagging production relations to correspond to the nature of the productive forces. Socialist society has the ability to do this because there are no decaying classes within it that can organize resistance. Of course, even under the socialist system, there are backward and inert forces that do not understand the necessity of changing production relations, but these forces are not difficult to overcome and will not lead to conflicts.

Regarding the third point.

From your arguments, it is clear that you consider the means of production produced by our nationalized enterprises, primarily the means of labor, to be commodities.

Can the means of production under our socialist system be considered commodities? In my opinion, they cannot be.

A commodity is a product that can be sold to any buyer, and after the sale of the commodity, the commodity owner loses ownership of the commodity, while the buyer becomes the owner of the commodity, who can resell, pledge, or let it rot. Do the means of production fit this definition? Obviously, they do not. First, the means of production are not "sold" to any buyer, not even "sold" to collective farms, but are only distributed by the state to its own enterprises. Second, the owner of the means of production—the state—does not lose ownership of them when they are handed over to a particular enterprise, but rather retains full ownership. Third, the manager of the enterprise, after receiving the means of production from the state, does not become the owner of these means of production, but is recognized as being commissioned by the Soviet state to use these means of production according to the plan given by the state.

From this, it is clear that under our system, the means of production cannot be classified as commodities.

Then, why do we talk about the value of the means of production, their cost, their price, etc.?

There are two reasons:

First, this is necessary for valuation, accounting, for calculating the profits and losses of enterprises, for checking and supervising enterprises. But this is only the formal aspect of the matter.

Second, this is necessary for the convenience of selling the means of production to foreign countries in foreign trade. Here, in the field of foreign trade, and only in this field, our means of production are indeed commodities, and are indeed sold (not in quotation marks).

Thus, in the field of foreign trade circulation, the means of production produced by our enterprises retain the characteristics of commodities both in substance and form, but in the field of domestic economic circulation, the means of production lose the characteristics of commodities, are no longer commodities, and go beyond the scope of the operation of the law of value, retaining only the shell of commodities (valuation, etc.).

How can this special situation be explained?

The problem lies in the fact that under our socialist conditions, economic development does not proceed in a revolutionary manner, but in a gradually changing manner. The old things are not simply abolished, but change their nature to adapt to the new things, retaining only their form. As for the new things, they do not simply abolish the old things, but penetrate into the old things, changing the nature and functions of the old things, without destroying their form, but utilizing their form to develop the new things. In our economic circulation, not only commodities are like this, but money is also like this, and even banks are like this. Banks lose their old functions and acquire new functions, while retaining the old form and being utilized by the socialist system.

If one looks at the problem from a formal point of view, from the point of view of the surface process of phenomena, one will arrive at an incorrect conclusion, as if the categories of capitalism in our economy also retain their effectiveness. If one uses the Marxist method of analysis to look at the problem, that is, strictly distinguishing the content of the economic process from its form, the deep process of development from surface phenomena, one will arrive at a single correct conclusion: the old categories of capitalism in our country have mainly retained their form, their external appearance, but in substance, these categories in our country have fundamentally changed to meet the needs of the development of the socialist national economy.

Regarding the fourth point.

You assert that the law of value has a regulatory influence on the prices of the "means of production" produced in agriculture and sold to the state at procurement prices. Here, you are referring to raw materials such as cotton. Here, you can also add flax, wool, and other agricultural raw materials.

First, it should be pointed out that in such cases, agriculture does not produce "means of production," but raw materials that are part of the means of production. One should not play with the term "means of production." When Marxists talk about the production of means of production, they first refer to the production of means of labor—Marx calls this the "mechanical means of labor, the sum of which can be called the system of bones and muscles of production," which system constitutes the "characteristic mark of the production of a certain era." Equating a part of the means of production (raw materials) with the entire means of production, including means of labor, is contrary to Marxism, because Marxism considers that, compared to all other means of production, means of labor play a decisive role. Everyone knows that raw materials themselves cannot produce means of labor, although certain raw materials are necessary materials for the production of means of labor, yet without means of labor, it is impossible to produce any raw materials.

Second, does the law of value have a regulatory influence on the prices of raw materials produced in agriculture, as you, Comrade Notkin, assert? If our country had "free" fluctuations in the prices of agricultural raw materials, if competition and the law of anarchic production operated in our country, if our country had no planned economy, if the production of raw materials was not regulated by the plan, then the influence of the law of value would indeed be regulatory. However, since in our national economic system, there are no such "ifs," the influence of the law of value on the prices of agricultural raw materials will certainly not be regulatory. First, the prices of agricultural raw materials in our country are fixed, regulated by the plan, and not "free." Second, the scale of production of agricultural raw materials is not determined by spontaneous forces or any accidental factors, but by the plan. Third, the means of production necessary for the production of agricultural raw materials are not concentrated in the hands of individuals or individual groups, but in the hands of the state. Since this is the case, what regulatory influence of the law of value is there? As a result, the law of value itself is regulated by the facts peculiar to socialist production mentioned above.

Therefore, one cannot deny that the law of value influences the formation of the prices of agricultural raw materials; it is one of the factors in this regard. However, one cannot deny even more that this influence does not play a regulatory role and cannot play a regulatory role.

Regarding the fifth point.

Regarding the profits of the socialist national economy, in the "Opinions," I refuted some comrades who asserted that since our planned national economy does not pay much attention to profitable enterprises and allows unprofitable enterprises to coexist with them, it is as if the planned national economy negates the principle of profitability itself in the economy. In the "Opinions," it is said that the profitability of individual enterprises and individual branches of production cannot be compared with the higher form of profitability given to us by socialist production, because socialist production avoids the crisis of overproduction and ensures the continuous improvement of our production.

However, if one draws the conclusion from this that the profitability of individual enterprises and individual branches of production is of no particular value and therefore not worth paying attention to, that would be incorrect. This is of course incorrect. The profitability of individual enterprises and individual branches of production is of great significance from the point of view of developing our production. This should be taken into account whether in planned construction or planned production. This is the basic knowledge of economic activity at our current stage of development.

Regarding the sixth point.

I do not know how to understand your statement about capitalism: "greatly changed in form and expanded production." One should say that such production, and even expanded production, does not exist in the world.

Obviously, at a time when the world market has split and the range of world resources seized by the major capitalist countries (the USA, Britain, France) has begun to shrink, the cyclical nature of capitalist development—growth and contraction of production—will certainly still exist. However, the growth of production in these countries will proceed on a shrinking base, because the production volume of these countries will decrease.

Regarding the seventh point.

The general crisis of the world capitalist system began during the First World War, especially after the USSR withdrew from the capitalist system. This is the first stage of the general crisis. During the Second World War, especially after the peoples' democratic countries of Europe and Asia withdrew from the capitalist system, the second stage of the general crisis unfolded. The first crisis of the First World War period and the second crisis of the Second World War period should be regarded not as separate, isolated, independent crises, but as two stages in the development of the general crisis of the world capitalist system.

Is the general crisis of world capitalism only a political or only an economic crisis? It is neither. It is a general, that is, comprehensive crisis of the world capitalist system, which includes both economic and political aspects. At the same time, it is also clear that the basis of this crisis is, on the one hand, the increasing disintegration of the capitalist world economic system, and on the other hand, the increasing economic strength of the countries that have withdrawn from capitalism—the USSR, China, and other peoples' democratic countries.

**Regarding the Errors of Comrade L. D. Yaroshchenko**

On March 20 of this year, Comrade Yaroshchenko wrote a letter distributed to the members of the Politburo of the CPSU (B), discussing several economic issues that were discussed at the well-known November meeting. In this letter, he complains that his "views were not reflected in any way" in some of the main summary documents of the discussion, as well as in Comrade Stalin's "Opinions." In addition, in this short letter, there is a suggestion from Comrade Yaroshchenko: to allow him to write a "Political Economy of Socialism" within a year or a year and a half and to provide him with two assistants to do this work.

I think that it is necessary to examine the essence of Comrade Yaroshchenko's complaint and his suggestion.

Let us start with his complaint.

What exactly are the "views" of Comrade Yaroshchenko that were not reflected in the aforementioned documents?

1. The main error of Comrade Yaroshchenko

If one were to evaluate Comrade Yaroshchenko's views in a few words, one would have to say that his views are non-Marxist, and therefore extremely erroneous.

Comrade Yaroshchenko's main error is that in the question of the role of productive forces and production relations in social development, he has departed from Marxism, excessively exaggerating the role of productive forces and, accordingly, excessively diminishing the role of production relations, to the point of declaring that production relations under the socialist system are a part of the productive forces.

Comrade Yaroshchenko agrees to recognize that production relations have some role under the conditions of "antagonistic class contradictions," because there, production relations "are in contradiction with the development of productive forces." However, he limits this role to a negative role, to the role of a factor that hinders the development of productive forces and binds the development of productive forces. Any positive function of production relations, Comrade Yaroshenko does not see.

As for the socialist system, where there are no "antagonistic class contradictions" and production relations "no longer contradict the development of productive forces," Comrade Yaroshchenko believes that here, any independent role of production relations is disappearing, production relations are no longer a major factor in development, and are swallowed up by productive forces, just as a part is swallowed by the whole. Comrade Yaroshchenko says, "In the socialist system, people's production relations are included in the organization of productive forces as a means, a component of this organization." (See Comrade Yaroshchenko's letter to the Politburo)

Thus, what is the main task of the political economy of socialism? Comrade Yaroshchenko answers: "Therefore, the main problem of the political economy of socialism is not the study of people's production relations in socialist society, but the formulation and development of the scientific theory of the organization of productive forces in social production, the theory of the planning of the national economy." (See Comrade Yaroshchenko's speech at the plenary discussion)

This indeed explains why Comrade Yaroshchenko is not interested in economic issues such as the existence of various forms of ownership in our economy, commodity circulation, the law of value, etc., in the socialist system, considering these to be secondary issues that can only lead to scholastic disputes. He openly declares that in his political economy of socialism, "the disputes about the role of certain categories of political economy of socialism—value, commodity, money, credit, etc.—which in our country often take on a scholastic character, will be replaced by healthy discussions and scientific arguments about the rational organization of productive forces in social production." (See Comrade Yaroshchenko's speech at the sectional discussion)

Thus, there is a political economy without economic issues.

Comrade Yaroshchenko believes that if the "rational organization of productive forces" is arranged, it will be possible to transition to communism without much difficulty. He believes that this is sufficient for the transition to communism. He openly declares:

"The main struggle for the construction of a communist society under the socialist system is reduced to the struggle for the correct organization of productive forces and the rational use of productive forces in social production." (See Comrade Yaroshchenko's speech at the plenary discussion) Comrade Yaroshchenko solemnly declares: "Communism—this is the highest scientific organization of productive forces in social production."

Thus, the "rational organization of productive forces" includes the essence of the communist system without remainder.

From all this, Comrade Yaroshchenko concludes that for all social formations, there cannot be a unified political economy, but there should be two kinds of political economy: one is the political economy of the various social formations before socialism, whose object is the study of people's production relations; the other is the political economy of the socialist system, whose object should not be the study of production relations, that is, economic relations, but the study of the problem of the rational organization of productive forces.

Comrade Yaroshchenko's views are such.

What can be said about such views?

First, it is incorrect to say that the role of production relations in social history is limited to the role of hindering the development of productive forces. When Marxists speak of the hindering role of production relations, they do not mean any production relations, but only the old production relations that can no longer correspond to the development of productive forces and therefore hinder the development of productive forces. However, in addition to old production relations, it is known that there are new production relations that replace the old production relations. Can one say that the role of new production relations is reduced to hindering the development of productive forces? No, one cannot. On the contrary, new production relations are a major and decisive force that truly determines the further and powerful development of productive forces. Without these new production relations, productive forces would be doomed to stagnate, as is the case now in capitalist countries.

No one can deny that the productive forces of Soviet industry have undergone tremendous development in several five-year plans. However, if we had not replaced the old capitalist production relations with new socialist production relations in October 1917, there would not have been such development. Without this change in our production relations, that is, economic relations, the productive forces of our country would have stagnated, as they are now stagnating in capitalist countries.

No one can deny that the productive forces of our agriculture have undergone tremendous development in the last twenty to twenty-five years. However, if we had not replaced the old capitalist production relations in the countryside with new collectivist production relations in the 1930s, there would not have been such development. Without this change in production, the productive forces of our agriculture would have stagnated, as they are now stagnating in capitalist countries.

Of course, new production relations cannot remain new forever, and they do not remain new forever; they begin to age and come into conflict with the further development of productive forces, and begin to lose their role as the main promoter of productive forces, becoming a hindrance to productive forces. At that time, new production relations appear to replace these already aged production relations, and the role of new production relations is to become the main promoter of the further development of productive forces.

The development of production relations from the role of hindering productive forces to the role of the main promoter of productive forces, and from the role of the main promoter of productive forces to the role of hindering productive forces—this characteristic of development is one of the main elements of Marxist dialectical materialism. This is known to all those who are now learning Marxism. Originally, Comrade Yaroshchenko did not know this.

Second, it is incorrect to say that the independent role of production relations, that is, economic relations, is disappearing under the socialist system, that production relations are being swallowed up by productive forces, and that social production under the socialist system is reduced to the organization of productive forces. Marxism regards social production as a whole, which has two inseparable aspects: social productive forces (the relationship of society to natural forces, society in the struggle with natural forces to obtain the necessary material means) and production relations (the mutual relations of people in the production process). These are two different aspects of social production, although they are inseparably connected. Precisely because they are two different aspects of social production, they can influence each other. To assert that one of these aspects can be swallowed up by the other and become a component part of it is a serious violation of Marxism.

Marx says:

"In production, people not only influence nature but also influence each other. They cannot engage in production if they do not unite in a certain way to carry out joint activities and exchange their activities. In order to engage in production, people enter into certain connections and relationships, and it is only through these social connections and relationships that there is a relationship of people to nature, a relationship of production." (See "Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Russian edition, Volume 5, page 429)

Thus, social production consists of two aspects, which, although inseparably connected, reflect two different kinds of relationships, namely, the relationship of people to nature (productive forces) and the mutual relationships of people in the production process (production relations). Only with the presence of these two aspects of production can there be social production—whether under the socialist system or other social formations.

Perhaps, Comrade Yaroshchenko does not quite agree with Marx. He considers that this principle of Marx is not applicable to the socialist system. Therefore, he reduces the problem of the political economy of socialism to the problem of the rational organization of productive forces, and discards production relations, that is, economic relations, and separates productive forces from production relations.

Thus, in Comrade Yaroshchenko, it is not Marxist political economy, but something like Bogdanov's "universal organizational science."

Thus, Comrade Yaroshchenko, after adopting the correct idea that productive forces are the most active and revolutionary forces in production, has carried this idea to an absurdity, denying the role of production relations, that is, economic relations, under the socialist system; and what was originally a lively social production, he has turned into one-sided and empty production technology, that is, something like Bukharin's "social organizational technique."

Marx says:

"In the social production of their life, people enter into definite relations that are independent of their will, these relations of production correspond to a definite stage of development of their material productive forces. The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political, and intellectual life process in general." (See "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy")

This means that every social formation, including socialist society, has its own economic base consisting of the sum total of people's production relations. Thus, the question arises: what is the economic base of the socialist system in Comrade Yaroshchenko? Everyone knows that Comrade Yaroshchenko has already eliminated the domain of production relations, which has some independence, under the socialist system, and has merged the remaining remnants of production relations into the organization of productive forces. I ask, does the socialist system have its own economic base? It seems that since the domain of production relations, which has some independence, has disappeared under the socialist system, the socialist system has no economic base.

Thus, there is a socialist system without its own economic base. This is a rather ridiculous thing...

Generally speaking, is it possible to have a social system without its own economic base? Perhaps, Comrade Yaroshchenko thinks it is possible. However, Marxism considers that such a social system does not exist in the world.

Finally, to say that communism is the rational organization of productive forces, that the rational organization of productive forces includes the essence of the communist system without remainder, and that if productive forces are rationally organized, it will be possible to transition to communism without much difficulty, is incorrect. In our literature, there is another definition of communism, another formula for communism, namely, Lenin's formula: "Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country." It seems that Comrade Yaroshchenko does not like Lenin's formula, and uses his own invented formula "Communism—this is the highest scientific organization of productive forces in social production" to replace Lenin's formula.

First, no one understands what Comrade Yaroshchenko boasts of this "highest scientific" or "rational" organization of productive forces. What is the specific content of this organization? Comrade Yaroshchenko, in his speeches at the plenary discussion and sectional discussion, and in his letter to the members of the Politburo, repeats this mythical formula dozens of times, but he does not attempt to explain in any way how this organization of productive forces, which supposedly includes the essence of the communist system without remainder, should be understood.

Second, if one has to choose between these two formulas, then the one that should be discarded is not the only correct formula of Lenin, but the so-called formula of Comrade Yaroshchenko, which is obviously fabricated and non-Marxist, and is something taken from Bogdanov's arsenal—"universal organizational science." Comrade Yaroshchenko believes that if productive forces are rationally organized, abundant products can be obtained and a transition to communism can be made, and a transition can be made from the formula "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" to the formula "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." This is a great mistake, which exposes his ignorance of the laws of the development of the socialist economy. Comrade Yaroshchenko imagines the conditions for the transition from socialism to communism too simply, in a childishly simple way. Comrade Yaroshchenko does not understand that if collective farm group ownership, commodity circulation, etc., economic facts remain, it will not be possible to obtain abundant products that can satisfy all the needs of society, nor will it be possible to transition to the formula "from each according to his needs." Comrade Yaroshchenko does not understand that before transitioning to the formula "from each according to his needs," society must go through a series of economic and cultural transformation stages, in which labor will change from merely a means of subsistence to the first need of life for the members of society, and public ownership will become the unshakable and inviolable foundation of social existence.

To prepare for the transition to communism in practice and not just in declarations, at least three basic prerequisites must be realized.

First, it must be ensured that the continuous growth of the entire social production, with the growth of the production of means of production taking the leading position. The growth of the production of means of production must take the leading position not only because this production should ensure the equipment needed by its own enterprises and all other departments of the national economy, but also because without this production, it is impossible to realize expanded reproduction.

Second, it is necessary to gradually raise the level of collective farm ownership to the level of public ownership, and also gradually replace commodity circulation with product exchange, so that the central government or another social economic center can control the entire product of social production for the benefit of society.

Comrade Yaroshchenko asserts that under the socialist system, there is no contradiction between the production relations of society and productive forces. This is incorrect. Of course, our current production relations are in a period when they fully correspond to the growth of productive forces and push productive forces forward by leaps and bounds. However, if one is self-satisfied with this and thinks that there is no contradiction between productive forces and production relations in our country, that would be incorrect. Because the development of production relations lags behind and will continue to lag behind the development of productive forces, contradictions undoubtedly exist and will continue to exist. Under the correct policy of the leadership, these contradictions will not turn into antagonisms, and thus there will be no conflict between the production relations of society and productive forces. If we implement the incorrect policy recommended by Comrade Yaroshchenko, it will be a different matter. In this case, conflict will be inevitable, and our production relations may become a serious obstacle to the further development of productive forces.

Therefore, the task of the leadership is to timely identify the growing contradictions and timely take measures to make production relations correspond to the growth of productive forces to overcome these contradictions. This is primarily related to economic phenomena such as collective farm group ownership and commodity circulation. Of course, at present, these phenomena are being effectively utilized by us to develop the socialist economy, and they are undoubtedly bringing undeniable benefits to our society. Undoubtedly, they will also bring benefits in the near future. However, at the same time, these phenomena have begun to hinder the powerful development of our productive forces, because they are hindering the business of completely including the entire national economy, especially agriculture, in state planning. If this is not seen, it is inexcusable blindness. Undoubtedly, the further we go, the more these phenomena will hinder the further growth of our productive forces. Therefore, the task is to gradually transform collective farm ownership into public ownership and also gradually replace commodity circulation with product exchange, thus eliminating these contradictions.

Third, it is necessary to raise the cultural level of society to such a height that it ensures the all-round development of the physical and mental abilities of all members of society, so that the members of society can receive an education that makes them active participants in social development, can freely choose their occupation, and will not be bound for life to a particular occupation due to the existing division of labor.

To achieve this, what is needed?

If one thinks that it is possible to achieve such a great cultural upsurge of society without greatly changing the current state of labor, that would be incorrect. To achieve this, first of all, it is necessary to reduce the daily working hours to at least six hours, and then to five hours. This is necessary to ensure that the members of society have sufficient free time to receive a comprehensive education. Secondly, to achieve this, it is necessary to implement compulsory comprehensive technical education, which is necessary to ensure that the members of society can freely choose their occupation and will not be bound for life to a particular occupation. Thirdly, to achieve this, it is necessary to fundamentally improve living conditions, to raise the actual wages of workers and employees by at least one fold, and perhaps even more, by not only directly raising monetary wages, but more importantly, by continuously lowering the prices of daily necessities.

The basic prerequisites for preparing the transition to communism are such.

Only after all these prerequisites are fully realized can one hope that labor will change from a burden to "the first need of life" (Marx) for the members of society, "labor from a heavy burden will become a pleasure" (Engels), and public ownership will be regarded by all members of society as the unshakable and inviolable foundation of social existence.

Only after all these prerequisites are fully realized can one transition from the socialist formula "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" to the communist formula "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."

This will be a fundamental transition from one economy, namely, the socialist economy, to another, higher economy, namely, the communist economy.

Thus, the transition from socialism to communism is not as simple as Comrade Yaroshchenko imagines.

To reduce this entire complex and diverse task, which requires major economic changes, to the "rational organization of productive forces," as Comrade Yaroshchenko does, is to replace Marxism with Bogdanov's fallacies.

2. Other errors of Comrade Yaroshchenko

1. From his incorrect views, Comrade Yaroshchenko drew incorrect conclusions about the nature and object of political economy.

Comrade Yaroshchenko believes that each social formation has its own unique economic laws. Starting from this point, he denies the necessity of a unified political economy that studies all social formations. But he is completely wrong, and here he is diametrically opposed to Marxist thinkers like Engels and Lenin.

Engels says that political economy is the "science of the conditions and forms under which the various different societies have produced and exchanged, and with it, the conditions and forms under which the products have been distributed" ("Anti-Dühring"). Therefore, political economy studies not the economic development laws of a particular social formation, but the economic development laws of various different social formations.

Everyone knows that Lenin fully agreed with this. In criticizing Bukharin's pamphlet "The Economic Theory of the Transition Period," he pointed out that Bukharin limited the scope of political economy to commodity production, primarily to capitalist production, which is incorrect; he simultaneously pointed out that here, Bukharin "retreated a step behind Engels."

The definition of political economy provided in the draft of the textbook on political economy is in full agreement with this. In this draft, it is said: political economy is the science that studies the laws of the production and distribution of material means of subsistence in the various stages of development of human society.

This is very clear. Various social formations, in their economic development, not only follow their own unique economic laws, but also follow economic laws common to all social formations, for example, the law of the unity of productive forces and production relations in a single social production, the law of the relationship between productive forces and production relations in the development of all social formations. Therefore, various social formations are not only separated from each other by their own unique laws, but are also connected with each other by economic laws common to all social formations.

Engels is completely correct: "To give a comprehensive criticism of bourgeois political economy, it is not enough to know the forms of production, exchange, and distribution of capitalism. One must—even if only in general terms—study and compare the forms that preceded the capitalist form or that coexist with the capitalist form in less developed countries." ("Anti-Dühring")

It seems that here, on this issue, Comrade Yaroshchenko is in tune with Bukharin.

Next, Comrade Yaroshchenko asserts that in his "political economy of socialism," "the categories of political economy—value, commodity, money, credit, etc.—will be replaced by healthy discussions about the rational organization of productive forces in social production"; therefore, the object of this political economy is not the production relations of socialism, but "the formulation and development of the scientific theory of the organization of productive forces, the theory of the planning of the national economy, etc."; the production relations under the socialist system lose their independent role and are swallowed up by productive forces, becoming a component part of them.

Title: On the Question of the Basic Economic Law of Socialism
Author: 斯大林

Page: 1

It must be said that in our country, no "Marxist" who has gone mad has ever spoken such nonsense. What does it mean to have a socialist political economy without economic problems, that is, production problems? Is there such a political economy in the world? In socialist political economy, what does it mean to replace economic problems with the problem of the rational organization of productive forces? This is tantamount to abolishing socialist political economy. Comrade Yaroslavsky is precisely doing this. He is abolishing socialist political economy. Here, he is completely in agreement with Bukharin. Bukharin said that when capitalism is destroyed, political economy will also be destroyed. Comrade Yaroslavsky did not say this, but he is doing it. He is doing the thing that Bukharin advocated and that Lenin opposed. Comrade Yaroslavsky is following in Bukharin's footsteps.

Moreover, Comrade Yaroslavsky reduces the problems of socialist political economy to the problem of the rational organization of productive forces, to the problem of the planning of the national economy, and so on. But he is completely wrong. The problem of the rational organization of productive forces, the problem of the planning of the national economy, and so on, are not the objects of political economy, but the objects of the economic policy of the leadership. These are two different domains, and they cannot be confused. Comrade Yaroslavsky confuses these two different things, and that is why he has run into a wall. Political economy studies the laws of the development of the production relations of people, that is, economic relations. This includes: (a) the forms of ownership of the means of production; (b) the different social groups' positions in production and their mutual relations that arise from this, or as Marx said, "the mutual exchange of their activities"; (c) the forms of distribution of products, which are entirely determined by the production relations. All these together constitute the object of political economy. This definition lacks the term "exchange" from Engels' definition. It lacks this term because "exchange" is usually understood by many people not as something characteristic of all social forms but only of certain social forms, namely, commodity exchange, which sometimes leads to misunderstandings, although Engels' term "exchange" does not refer only to commodity exchange. However, the thing that Engels referred to with the term "exchange" is obviously included in the above definition as a constituent part. Therefore, in terms of content, the definition of the object of political economy is completely consistent with Engels' definition.

Secondly, when people talk about the basic economic law of a certain social formation, they usually proceed from the following point: a social formation cannot have several basic economic laws; it can have only one basic economic law as the basic law. Otherwise, each social formation would have several basic economic laws, which would contradict the concept of a basic law itself. However, Comrade Yaroslavsky does not agree with this. He believes that the basic economic law of socialism can be not one, but several. This is hard to believe, but it is a fact. In his speech at the plenary session, he said:

"The quantity and proportion of the material total of social production and reproduction are determined by the fact and prospects of the growth of the labor force drawn into social production. This is the basic economic law of socialist society, which determines the structure of social production and reproduction under the socialist system."

This is his first basic economic law of socialism.

In the same speech, Comrade Yaroslavsky declared:

"The ratio of the first department to the second department in socialist society is determined by the need for the production of means of production, and the scale of this production is determined by the quantity of the entire able-bodied population drawn into social production. This is the basic economic law of socialism, and at the same time, this is the requirement derived from the labor right of Soviet people in our constitution."

This is the so-called second basic economic law of socialism.

Finally, in his letter to the members of the Central Committee, Comrade Yaroslavsky declared:

"From this, the characteristics and requirements of the basic economic law of socialism, as I see it, can be roughly formulated as follows: the continuous growth and improvement of the material and cultural conditions of life of society."

This is already the third basic economic law of socialism.

Are all these laws the basic economic laws of socialism, or is only one of them? If it is one of them, then which one is it? Comrade Yaroslavsky did not give an answer to these questions in his letter to the members of the Central Committee. In his letter to the members of the Central Committee, when he formulated the basic economic law of socialism, he probably "forgot" that three months earlier, in his speech at the plenary session, he had already formulated the other two basic economic laws of socialism. Perhaps he thought that no one would notice this very unskillful trick. But his plan obviously failed.

Let us assume that Comrade Yaroslavsky's first two basic economic laws of socialism no longer exist, and that Comrade Yaroslavsky now considers the third formula he stated in his letter to the members of the Central Committee to be the basic economic law of socialism. Let us look at Comrade Yaroslavsky's letter.

In this letter, Comrade Yaroslavsky said that he does not agree with Comrade Stalin's definition of the basic economic law of socialism in his "Opinion." He said:

"In this definition, the main thing is 'to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the needs of the whole society...'. Here, it is indicated that production is a means to achieve this main purpose, that is, to satisfy needs. This definition gives grounds to think that the basic economic law of socialism you have formulated is not based on production being primary, but on consumption being primary."

Obviously, Comrade Yaroslavsky has completely failed to understand the essence of the problem and does not see that the discussion of whether consumption or production is primary is irrelevant to the problem. When people talk about one social process being primary over another, their starting point is usually that these two processes are more or less of the same kind. One can and must say that the production of means of production is primary over the production of means of consumption, because in both cases we are talking about production, and therefore they are more or less of the same kind. But one cannot say that consumption is primary over production or production is primary over consumption, if one says that, it is incorrect. Because production and consumption are two completely different domains, although they are interconnected, they are still different domains. Comrade Yaroslavsky obviously does not understand that what is being talked about here is not the primacy of consumption or production, but what purpose society sets for social production, what task it makes social production serve, for example, under the socialist system. Therefore, Comrade Yaroslavsky's statement that "production is the basis of life in socialist society, just as it is the basis of life in any other society" is also completely irrelevant to the problem. Comrade Yaroslavsky forgot that people do not produce for the sake of production, but for the sake of satisfying their needs. He forgot that production that is disconnected from satisfying social needs will decline and perish.

Can one generally speak of the purpose of socialist production or capitalist production, generally speak of the tasks that capitalist production or socialist production serves? I think one can and should.

Marx said:

"The direct purpose of capitalist production is not the production of commodities, but the production of surplus value or profit in its developed form; not the production of products, but the production of surplus products. From this point of view, labor itself is productive labor only in so far as it creates surplus value or surplus products for capital; in so far as the worker does not create this, his labor is unproductive labor. Consequently, the quantity of productive labor used is of interest to capital only in so far as it increases the quantity of surplus labor; only in so far as this is the case, we call the necessary labor time necessary. As long as labor does not produce such results, it is superfluous, it is to be stopped. Therefore, the quantity of productive labor used is of interest to capital only in so far as it increases the quantity of surplus labor; only in so far as this is the case, we call the necessary labor time necessary. As long as labor does not produce such results, it is superfluous, it is to be stopped."

"Capitalist production has as its purpose, with the smallest amount of capital advanced, to create the greatest amount of surplus value or surplus products; since this result cannot be achieved by the overwork of the worker, capital has the tendency to produce the product with the least possible expenditure, that is, to save labor power and expenditure..."

"From the actual position of the worker in capitalist production, the worker himself is only a means of production, not the purpose itself, and not the purpose of production." (See "Theory of Surplus Value," Volume II, Part II)

Marx's words are especially excellent because they not only succinctly and accurately determine the purpose of capitalist production, but also point out what the main purpose and main task should be for socialist production.

Therefore, the purpose of capitalist production is profit, and consumption is only necessary for capitalism in so far as it ensures the completion of the task of obtaining profit. Outside of this, the problem of consumption loses its meaning for capitalism. People and their needs disappear from the field of vision.

What is the purpose of socialist production? What is the main task that socialist production should serve under the socialist system?

The purpose of socialist production is not profit, but people and their needs, that is, the satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of people. The purpose of socialist production, as stated in Comrade Stalin's "Opinion," is "to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole society."

Comrade Yaroslavsky thinks that here it is said that consumption is primary over production. This is, of course, a confused idea. In fact, the problem here is not that consumption is primary, but that socialist production serves its main purpose, that is, to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole society.

Therefore, to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole society is the purpose of socialist production; to make socialist production continuously grow and improve on a high technological basis is the means to achieve this purpose.

The basic economic law of socialism is such.

Comrade Yaroslavsky wants to maintain the so-called "primacy" of production over consumption, and therefore he concludes that the "basic economic law of socialism" is "the continuous growth and improvement of the material and cultural conditions of life of society." This is completely wrong. Comrade Yaroslavsky has brutally distorted and damaged the formula stated in Comrade Stalin's "Opinion." In Comrade Yaroslavsky, production has been turned from a means into an end, while ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of society has been abolished. The result is that production growth is for the sake of production growth, production is the end in itself, and people and their needs have disappeared from Comrade Yaroslavsky's field of vision.

Therefore, as the purpose of socialist production, people disappear, and the last remnants of Marxism in Comrade Yaroslavsky's "concept" also disappear, which is not surprising.

Thus, in Comrade Yaroslavsky, it turns out that it is not production that is primary over consumption, but rather the bourgeois ideology system is primary over the Marxist ideology system.

Thirdly, the question of Marx's theory of reproduction should be discussed separately. Comrade Yaroslavsky asserts that Marx's theory of reproduction is only a theory of capitalist reproduction, and it does not contain anything that can be effective for other social formations, including the socialist social formation. He says:

"To transfer Marx's reproduction formulas, which he formulated for the capitalist economy, to socialist social production is the result of a dogmatic understanding of Marx's teachings and is in contradiction with the essence of his teachings." (See Comrade Yaroslavsky's speech at the plenary session)

Next, he asserts that:

"Marx's reproduction formulas do not correspond to the economic laws of socialist society and cannot serve as the basis for the study of socialist reproduction." (Ibid.)

When talking about Marx's simple reproduction theory, in which he established a certain ratio between the production of means of production (the first department) and the production of means of consumption (the second department), Comrade Yaroslavsky says:

"The ratio of the first department to the second department in socialist society is not determined by Marx's formula of 'the V + M of the first department and the C of the second department.' Under socialist conditions, the mutual connection of the above-mentioned first department and second department in their development should not exist." (Ibid.)

He asserts that:

"Marx's theory of the ratio between the first department and the second department is not applicable under the socialist conditions of our country, because Marx's theory is based on capitalist economics and its laws." (See Comrade Yaroslavsky's letter to the members of the Central Committee)

This is how Comrade Yaroslavsky criticizes Marx's theory of reproduction.

Of course, Marx's theory of reproduction, which he formulated as a result of studying the laws of capitalist production, reflects the characteristics of capitalist production and naturally has the form of capitalist commodity value relations. It could not be otherwise. But in Marx's theory of reproduction, if one sees only this form and does not see its basis, does not see its basic content, which is effective not only for the capitalist social formation but also for all social formations, especially for the socialist social formation, then one does not understand this theory at all. If Comrade Yaroslavsky had any understanding of this problem, then he would understand this obvious truth: Marx's reproduction formulas are by no means limited to reflecting the characteristics of capitalist production; they also contain many basic principles of reproduction that are effective for all social formations, especially for the socialist social formation. The basic principles of Marx's theory of reproduction, such as the principle of the division of social production into the production of means of production and the production of means of consumption; the principle of the priority of the growth of the production of means of production in expanded reproduction; the principle of the ratio between the first department and the second department; the principle that surplus product is the only source of accumulation; the principle of the formation and use of social funds; the principle that accumulation is the only source of expanded reproduction, all these basic principles of Marx's theory of reproduction are not only effective for the capitalist social formation, but any socialist society in planning the national economy cannot do without these principles. It is worth noting that Comrade Yaroslavsky himself, although he so arrogantly despises Marx's "reproduction formulas," in discussing the problem of socialist reproduction, has to repeatedly resort to these formulas.

How did Lenin and Marx view this problem?

Everyone knows Lenin's criticism of Bukharin's "Economics of the Transition Period." In these opinions, everyone knows that Lenin acknowledged that Marx's formula of the ratio between the first department and the second department, which is precisely what Comrade Yaroslavsky strongly opposes, is effective for both socialism and "pure communism," that is, the second stage of communism.

As for Marx, everyone knows that he did not like to leave the study of the laws of capitalist production, and in his "Capital," he did not study the question of whether his reproduction formulas are applicable to socialism. However, in "Capital," Volume II, Chapter 20, "The Constant Capital of the First Department," when discussing the exchange of the products of this department within this department, he incidentally pointed out that this exchange of the products of this department will continue under the socialist system, just as it does under capitalist production. Marx said:

"If production is socially owned and not capitalist, then it is obvious that the products of the first department, for the purpose of reproduction, will be redistributed among the various production departments of this department as means of production: part will remain directly in the production department that produced it, and part will be transferred to other production departments, thus establishing a continuous movement of exchange between the various production departments of this department." (See Marx's "Capital," Russian edition, Volume II, page 307)

Therefore, although Marx studied the laws of capitalist production, he did not think that his theory of reproduction was effective only for capitalist production. On the contrary, he obviously thought that his theory of reproduction was also effective for socialist production.

It should be noted that in his "Critique of the Gotha Program," when analyzing the economy of socialism and the transition period to communism, Marx proceeded from the basic principles of his theory of reproduction, obviously considering these basic principles to be applicable to the communist system.

It should also be noted that in his "Anti-Dühring," when criticizing Dühring's "economic system" and explaining the economy of the socialist system, Engels also proceeded from the basic principles of Marx's theory of reproduction, considering these basic principles to be applicable to the communist system.

The fact is such.

As a result, here, in the question of reproduction, Comrade Yaroslavsky, although he makes outrageous remarks about Marx's "formulas," has run into a wall.

Fourthly, at the end of his letter to the members of the Central Committee, Comrade Yaroslavsky proposes to entrust him with the writing of "Socialist Political Economy." He writes:

"Based on the definition of the object of socialist political economy that I have expressed in the plenary session, the group discussions, and this letter, using the dialectical method of Marxism, I can solve the various basic problems of socialist political economy theoretically in one year, at most one and a half years, with the help of two people, and expound the Marxist, Leninist-Stalinist theory of socialist political economy, which will certainly turn this science into an effective weapon for the people's struggle for communism."

One cannot but admit that Comrade Yaroslavsky's flaw is not modesty. Even, using some literary expressions, one can say: "It is quite the opposite."

It has already been said that Comrade Yaroslavsky confuses socialist political economy with the economic policy of the leadership. The object of socialist economy that he considers to be the rational organization of productive forces, the planning of the national economy, the formation of social funds, and so on, are not the object of socialist political economy, but the object of the economic policy of the leadership.

I need not say that the serious errors and non-Marxist "views" of Comrade Yaroslavsky make it impossible for us to entrust him with such a task.

Conclusion:

(1) Comrade Yaroslavsky's accusation against the leaders of the discussion is meaningless, because the leaders of the discussion are Marxists and cannot reflect Comrade Yaroslavsky's non-Marxist "views" in their summary documents.

(2) The request to entrust Comrade Yaroslavsky with the writing of socialist political economy cannot be considered serious, at least because his request is full of the smell of Hlestakov.  Y. Stalin, May 22, 1952

[Note] Hlestakov is the main character in Gogol's famous comedy "The Inspector General." He is a typical figure of a swindler, a hypocrite, and a shameless person. —Translator

Reply to Comrades Sanina and Vinsh

I have received your letter. It can be seen that you are deeply and seriously studying the economic problems of our country. The letter contains many correct statements and interesting views. But apart from this, the letter also contains some serious theoretical errors. In this reply, I want to talk only about these errors.

First, on the question of the nature of the economic laws of socialism

Comrades Sanina and Vinsh assert that: "Only because of the conscious actions of Soviet people engaged in material production, the economic laws of socialism are produced." This thesis is completely incorrect.

Is there an objective regularity in the development of the economy that exists outside of us and is not subject to the will and consciousness of people? Marxism's answer to this question is affirmative. Marxism believes that the laws of socialist political economy are the reflection in people's minds of the objective regularity that exists outside of us. But the formula of these two comrades answers this question negatively. That is to say, these two comrades stand on an incorrect theoretical position, which asserts that the economic laws of development under the socialist system are "created" and "transformed" by the leadership of society. In other words, they have deviated from Marxism and taken the road of subjective idealism.

Of course, people can discover these objective laws, understand them, and rely on them, use them to benefit society. But people can neither "create" nor "transform" them.

Suppose we temporarily adopt the incorrect theoretical position, deny the existence of objective regularity in the economic life of society under the socialist system, and proclaim the possibility of "creating" economic laws and "transforming" economic laws. What will be the result? This will plunge us into the kingdom of chaos and chance, make us dependent on these chances like slaves, make us not only lose the possibility of understanding things, but even blindly grope in this chaotic chance. This will make us abolish the science of political economy, because if we do not recognize objective regularity and do not study these regularities, science cannot exist and develop. If science is abolished, we will not be able to foresee the course of events in the domestic economic life, that is, we will not be able to do even the most basic economic leadership work.

In the end, we will be at the mercy of those "economic" adventurers who are determined to "destroy" the laws of economic development, do not understand and do not consider objective regularity, and come to "create" new laws.

Everyone knows the classic statement of Marxism on this problem provided by Engels in his "Anti-Dühring":

"The social forces, like the natural forces, act blindly, coercively, and destructively before we understand and respect them. But once we understand them, study their activities, directions, and influences, then we can completely control them, make them increasingly subject to our will, and use them to achieve our goals. This is especially true for the powerful productive forces of modern times. When we stubbornly refuse to understand the nature and characteristics of the productive forces—while the capitalist mode of production and its defenders are against this understanding—these productive forces always act against us and against our interests, as has been detailed above. But when the nature of the productive forces is understood, they will become obedient servants in the hands of the united producers, transforming from a demonic ruler into a submissive servant. The difference here is like the difference between the destructive electric force in lightning and the tamed electric force in the telegraph machine and the arc lamp, and like the difference between the fire of a fire and the fire used by people. When people can handle modern productive forces according to their finally understood nature, the anarchic production in society will be replaced by the planned regulation of production in society, which is for the satisfaction of the needs of the whole society and each member of society. Then the capitalist mode of appropriation will be replaced by a new mode of appropriation. In the capitalist mode of appropriation, the products first enslave the producers and then enslave the appropriators, while the new mode of appropriation is based on the nature of modern means of production: on the one hand, the products are directly appropriated by society as the means of maintaining and expanding production, and on the other hand, the products are directly appropriated by individuals as the means of life and enjoyment."

Second, on the question of the method of raising the collective farm ownership to the level of national ownership

In order to raise the collective farm ownership (which, of course, is not national ownership) to the level of national ("public") ownership, what methods should be adopted?

Some comrades think that, following the example of the handling of capitalist property in the past, the property of the collective farms should be directly nationalized and declared to be public property. This proposal is completely incorrect and absolutely cannot be adopted. The property of the collective farms is socialist property, so we cannot handle it in the same way as capitalist property. We cannot say that the property of the collective farms is not socialist property just because it is not national property.

These comrades think that the transfer of the property of individuals or individual groups to the state is the only or at least the best form of nationalization. This is incorrect. In fact, the transfer to the state is not the only, even the best form of nationalization, but the most primitive form of nationalization, as Engels correctly said in "Anti-Dühring" on this point. When the state still exists, the transfer to the state is undoubtedly the most easily understood primitive form of nationalization. But the state is not eternal. With the expansion of the scope of socialist activities in the majority of countries in the world, the state will gradually wither away, and thus the problem of transferring the property of individuals and individual groups to the state will naturally disappear. The state will definitely wither away, and society will definitely remain. Therefore, the successor of public property is not the state that is about to wither away, but society itself, represented by the central economic leadership.

Then, in order to raise the collective farm ownership to the level of national ownership, what methods should be adopted?

As the basic method to raise the collective farm ownership in this way, Comrades Sanina and Vinsh propose: to sell the basic means of production concentrated in the agricultural machinery stations to the collective farms, making them the owners, thus relieving the state of the burden of basic investment in agriculture, and making the collective farms themselves bear the expenses of maintaining and developing the agricultural machinery stations. They say:

"If it is thought that the investment of the collective farms should mainly be used for the cultural needs of the collective villages, while the needs of agricultural production should still be mainly invested by the state in large quantities, this is incorrect. Because the collective farms have the ability to completely bear this burden, and to relieve the state of this burden, is it not more correct? In order to produce a large number of consumer goods domestically, the state still has a lot to do in its investment."

To argue for this proposal, the proposers put forward several arguments:

First, they cite Stalin's statement that means of production are not sold to collective farms, and the proposers doubt Stalin's point, claiming that the state is indeed selling means of production to collective farms, such as large sickles, small sickles, and other small tools, as well as small engines, and so on. They think that since the state sells these means of production to the collective farms, then the state can also sell all other means of production, such as the machines of the agricultural machinery stations, to the collective farms.

This argument is untenable. Of course, the state sells small tools to the collective farms, which is allowed by the regulations of the agricultural labor associations and the constitution. But can small tools and means of production such as the machines of the agricultural machinery stations, or, for example, land, which is also a means of agricultural production, be compared? Obviously, they cannot. They cannot be compared because small tools do not determine the fate of the collective farm's production at all, but means of production such as the machines of the agricultural machinery stations and land, under the current conditions of our country, can completely determine the fate of agriculture.

It is not difficult to understand that when Stalin said that means of production are not sold to collective farms, he was referring not to small tools, but to the basic means of production of agriculture, that is, the machines of the agricultural machinery stations and land. The proposers play with the word "means of production," confusing two different things, and they unknowingly run into a wall.

Second, Comrades Sanina and Vinsh also cite that at the beginning of the mass collective farm movement—at the end of 1929 and the beginning of 1930, the Central Committee of the CPSU (B) itself advocated transferring the agricultural machinery stations to the ownership of the collective farms, while requiring the collective farms to repay the value of the agricultural machinery stations within three years. They think that although this matter failed at that time "because" the collective farms were "poor," but now, when the collective farms are already rich, it is possible to return to the policy of selling the agricultural machinery stations to the collective farms.

This argument is also untenable. In early 1930, the Central Committee of the CPSU (B) did indeed decide to sell the agricultural machinery stations to the collective farms. At that time, this decision was made according to the suggestion of some members of the collective farm shock brigades, as an experiment, as a trial, in order to return to this issue in a short time to review it. But the first review showed that this decision was inappropriate. After a few months, that is, at the end of 1930, this decision was canceled.

The subsequent growth of the collective farm movement and the development of collective farm construction made the collective farm members and the leadership personnel finally realize that concentrating the basic means of production of agriculture in the hands of the state, in the hands of the agricultural machinery stations, is the only way to ensure the high-speed growth of collective farm production.

We are all glad to see the great increase in agricultural production in our country, the increase in the production of grain, cotton, flax, sugar beets, and so on. What is the source of this increase? The source of this increase is modern technology, the many modern machines serving all these production departments. The problem here is not just about general technology, but about technology that cannot stop, it must continue to improve day by day, old technology must be discarded, replaced by new technology, and new technology must be replaced by the latest technology. If this is not done, the rapid development of socialist agriculture in our country is unimaginable, whether it is a rich harvest or abundant agricultural products, it is unimaginable. But to discard tens of thousands of wheel-type tractors and replace them with caterpillar-type tractors, to discard tens of thousands of old combine harvesters and replace them with new combine harvesters, and, for example, to manufacture new machines for technical crops, what does this mean? This means to bear a loss of tens of billions, which cannot be fully recovered until six to eight years later. Even if the collective farms in our country are millionaires, can they bear such a huge loss? No, they cannot, because they do not have the ability to bear the loss of tens of billions of expenses that can only be fully recovered after six to eight years. Such a loss can only be borne by the state, because the state, and only the state, can bear the loss of replacing old machines with new machines, because the state, and only the state, can bear the loss of recovering this expense only after six to eight years.

After understanding all this, then what does it mean to propose to sell the agricultural machinery stations to the collective farms for ownership? This means to cause the collective farms to suffer huge losses, to bankrupt the collective farms, to destroy the mechanization of agriculture, and to reduce the speed of collective farm production.

From this, it can be concluded that Comrades Sanina and Vinsh's proposal to sell the agricultural machinery stations to the collective farms for ownership is a step backward, an attempt to turn the wheel of history backward.

Let us assume for a moment that we accept the proposal of Comrades Sanina and Vinsh and start to sell the basic means of production, the agricultural machinery stations, to the collective farms for ownership. What will be the result?

First, the result will be that the collective farms will become the owners of the basic means of production, that is, they will be in a special position that no enterprise in our country has, because it is known that even nationalized enterprises in our country are not the owners of the means of production. What reason can be used as the basis for the special position of the collective farms? What progressive, forward-looking reason can be used as the basis? Can it be said that such a position will promote the collective farm ownership to the level of national ownership, will accelerate our society's transition from socialism to communism? If it is said that such a position will only make the collective farm ownership farther away from national ownership, not closer to communism, but farther away from communism, is it not more correct?

Second, the result will be the expansion of the scope of commodity circulation, because a huge amount of means of agricultural production will be put into the scope of commodity circulation. Can the expansion of the scope of commodity circulation make us advance towards communism? What do Comrades Sanina and Vinsh think? If it is said that it will only hinder our advance towards communism, is it not more correct?

The fundamental error of Comrades Sanina and Vinsh is that they do not understand the role and significance of commodity circulation under the socialist system, do not understand that commodity circulation is incompatible with the future of the transition from socialism to communism. Perhaps they think that even with commodity circulation, it is possible to transition from socialism to communism, and commodity circulation will not hinder this cause. This is a serious error due to not understanding Marxism.

In his "Anti-Dühring," Engels criticized Dühring's advocacy of the "economic commune" operating under the conditions of commodity circulation and proved that the existence of commodity circulation would necessarily make Dühring's so-called "economic commune" revive capitalism. Perhaps Comrades Sanina and Vinsh do not agree with this. Then they are even more untenable. But we Marxists proceed from this famous Marxist principle: the transition from socialism to communism and the communist principle of distributing products according to needs exclude any commodity exchange, and therefore also exclude the transformation of products into commodities, and at the same time, the transformation of products into value.

The situation with the proposal and arguments of Comrades Sanina and Vinsh is such.

In order to raise the collective farm ownership to the level of national ownership, what steps should be taken in the end?

The collective farm is not an ordinary enterprise. The land cultivated by the collective farm is no longer the property of the collective farm, but the property of the whole nation. Therefore, the collective farm is not the owner of the land it cultivates.

Next, the basic means of production used by the collective farm are not the property of the collective farm, but the property of the whole nation. Therefore, the collective farm is not the owner of the basic means of production.

Again, the collective farm is a cooperative enterprise, it uses the labor of its own members, distributes income to the members according to labor days, and the collective farm has its own seeds used for production, which are renewed every year.

The question is, what does the collective farm actually own, what is the property of the collective farm that it can freely and completely dispose of? This property is the products of the collective farm, the products produced by the collective farm, that is, grain, meat, oil, vegetables, cotton, sugar beets, flax, and so on, while buildings and individual plots in the collective farm are not included. The problem is that a large part of this product, that is, the surplus product of the collective farm, enters the market, and thus enters the system of commodity circulation. It is precisely this situation that now hinders the raising of the collective farm ownership to the level of national ownership. Therefore, it is precisely from this aspect that work should be done to raise the collective farm ownership to the level of national ownership.

In order to raise the collective farm ownership to the level of national ownership, it is necessary to exclude the surplus product of the collective farm from the system of commodity circulation and include it in the system of product exchange between the state industry and the collective farm. The essence of the problem lies here.

We do not yet have a developed system of product exchange, but there are the beginnings of product exchange in the form of "barter" of agricultural products.

Everyone knows that "barter" has been implemented for the products of cotton-growing, flax-growing, sugar beet-growing, and other collective farms. Of course, this is an incomplete, partial "barter," but it is a "barter" after all. It should be noted that the term "barter" is inappropriate and should be replaced by "product exchange." The task is to cultivate these beginnings of product exchange in all departments of agriculture and develop them into a vast system of product exchange, so that the collective farms can obtain not only money but mainly the necessary manufactured goods when they hand over their products. Such a system requires a large increase in the products sent from the city to the countryside, so the implementation of this system does not need to be rushed, but should be done according to the degree of accumulation of manufactured goods in the city. However, this system should be implemented resolutely, step by step, to reduce the scope of commodity circulation and expand the scope of product exchange.

Such a system not only reduces the scope of commodity circulation, making it easier for socialism to transition to communism, but also allows us to include the basic property of the collective farm, the products of the collective farm, in the overall system of national planning.

In order to raise the collective farm ownership to the level of national ownership under the current conditions of our country, this will be a practical and decisive measure.

Is such a system beneficial to the farmers of the collective farms? Undoubtedly, it is beneficial. It is beneficial because the products obtained by the collective farm farmers from the state will be much more and much cheaper than those obtained in commodity circulation. Everyone knows that the collective farms that have signed product exchange ("barter") contracts with the government have obtained much greater benefits than those that have not signed such contracts. If the product exchange system is extended to all collective farms in the country, then these benefits will become the benefits that all collective farm farmers in our country can enjoy.  Y. Stalin, September 28, 1952

    苏联社会主义经济问题
    答А·И·诺特京同志
    斯大林诺特京同志！
    我没有急于回信，因为你所提出的问题，我认为并不是紧急的。加之还有别的带紧急性的问题，自然，就把对你的来信的注意力转移了。
    我来逐点回答。
    关于第一点。
    在我的“意见”中有一个大家知道的原理：社会在科学法则面前并不是无能为力的，人们认识了经济法则，就能利用它们来为社会谋福利。你断定说，这一原理不能适用于其他社会形态，它只能在社会主义制度和共产主义制度下才有效，比方说，在资本主义制度下，经济过程的自发性质，就不会使社会有可能利用经济法则来为社会谋福利。
    这是不对的。在资产阶级革命时代，例如，在法国，资产阶级就曾利用生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这个大家知道的法则来反对封建制度，推翻了封建的生产关系，建立了新的资产阶级的生产关系，并且使这种生产关系和在封建制度内部生长起来的生产力的性质相适合。资产阶级做到了这件事，并不是由于它的特殊本领，而是因为它对于这件事有切身的利害关系。封建主反抗这件事，并不是由于他们的愚钝，而是由于他们有切身的利害关系，要来阻挠这一法则的实现。
    关于我国的社会主义革命，也应该这样说。工人阶级利用生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的法则，推翻了资产阶级的生产关系，建立了新的社会主义的生产关系，并且使这种生产关系和生产力的性质相适合。工人阶级能够做到了这件事，并不是由于它的特殊本领，而是因为它对于这件事有切身的利害关系。已从资产阶级革命初期的先进力量变成了反革命力量的资产阶级，曾经竭力反抗这一法则的实现，——它之所以反抗，并不是由于它没有组织性，也不是因为经济过程的自发性质推动它去反抗，而主要是由于它有切身的利害关系，要来反对这一法则的实现。
    由此可见：
    一、在某种程度内利用经济过程、经济法则来为社会谋福利，这样的事情也不仅在社会主义制度和共产主义制度下发生，而且在其他社会形态下也发生。
    二、在阶级社会里利用经济法则无论何时何地都有阶级背景，而且利用经济法则为社会谋福利的旗手无论何时何地都是先进阶级，而衰朽的阶级则反抗这件事情。
    在这件事情上，无产阶级与其他曾在历史上完成过生产关系变革的阶级间的差别就在于：无产阶级的阶级利益是和社会绝大多数人的利益融合在一起的，因为无产阶级革命不是消灭这种或那种形式的剥削，而是消灭任何剥削；至于其他阶级的革命，却只是消灭这种或那种形式的剥削，而为它们与社会绝大多数人利益相矛盾的狭隘阶级利益所限制。
    在“意见”中说到利用经济法则为社会谋福利这件事的阶级背景。那里说：“在自然科学中，发现和应用新的法则是或多或少顺利地进行的；与此相反，在经济学领域中，发现和应用那些触犯社会衰朽力量的利益的新法则，却要遇到这些力量极强烈的反抗。”但是你没有注意到这一点。
    关于第二点。
    你断定说，只有在社会主义制度和共产主义制度下，才能达到使生产关系完全适合生产力的性质，而在其他社会形态下，只能实现不完全的适合。
    这是不对的。在资产阶级革命之后，当资产阶级破坏了封建的生产关系、确立了资产阶级的生产关系的时代，无疑地曾经有过一个时期，资产阶级的生产关系是完全适合生产力的性质的。否则，资本主义就不会像它在资产阶级革命之后那样迅速地发展了。
    其次，“完全适合”这种说法是不能在绝对的意义上来理解的。不能把这种说法理解为仿佛在社会主义制度下，决没有生产关系落后于生产力的增长的现象。生产力是生产中最活动、最革命的力量。这种力量，就在社会主义制度下，也无可争辩地是走在生产关系前面的。生产关系只是经过一些时候，才会被改造得适合于生产力的性质。
    那末，“完全适合”这种说法该怎样来理解呢？应该理解为在社会主义制度下，通常不会弄到生产关系和生产力发生冲突，社会有可能及时使落后了的生产关系去适合生产力的性质。社会主义社会有可能做到这点，是因为在这社会的成分中没有那些能够组织反抗的衰朽的阶级。当然，就是在社会主义制度下，也有落后的惰性的力量，它们不了解生产关系有改变的必要，但是这种力量，当然不难克服，而不致把事情弄到冲突的地步。
    关于第三点。
    从你的议论中可以看出，你把我们国有化企业所生产的生产资料，首先是生产工具，看做是商品。
    可不可以把我国社会主义制度下的生产资料看做是商品呢？据我看来，无论如何是不可以的。
    商品是这样的一种产品，它可以出售给任何买主，而且在商品出售之后，商品所有者便失去对商品的所有权，而买主则变成商品的所有者，他可以把商品转售、抵押或让它腐烂。生产资料是否适合于这个定义呢？显然，是不适合的。第一，生产资料并不“出售”给任何买主，甚至不“出售”给集体农庄，而只是由国家分配给自己的企业。第二，生产资料所有者——国家，在把生产资料交给某一个企业时，丝毫不失去对它们的所有权，相反地，是完全保持着所有权的。第三，企业的经理，从国家手中取得了生产资料之后，不但不变成这些生产资料的所有者，相反地，是被确认为受苏维埃国家的委任，依照国家所交下的计划，来使用这些生产资料的。
    由此可见，无论如何不能把我国制度下的生产资料列入商品范畴中。
    那末，为什么又讲生产资料的价值，讲它们的成本，讲它们的价格等等呢？
    有两个原因：
    第一，这是为了估价、为了核算、为了计算企业的盈亏、为了检查和监督企业所必需的。但这只是事情的形式的一面。
    第二，这是为了在对外贸易上便于把生产资料出售给外国所必需的。这里，在对外贸易领域内，并且仅仅是在这个领域内，我们的生产资料才确实是商品，才确实被出售（不是加引号的出售）。
    这样看来，在对外贸易流通领域内，我国企业所生产的生产资料，无论在实质上或形式上都保持着商品的特性，可是在国内经济流通领域内，生产资料却失去商品的特性，不再是商品，并且超出价值法则发生作用的范围之外，仅仅保持着商品的外壳（估价等等）。
    这种特殊情况究竟怎样解释呢？
    问题在于：在我国社会主义条件下，经济发展并不是以变革的方式，而是以逐渐改变的方式进行的，旧的东西并不是简单地被废除干净，而是把自己的本性改变得与新的东西相适应，仅仅保持着自己的形式；至于新的东西也不是简单地消灭旧的东西，而是渗到旧的东西里面去，改变旧东西的本性和机能，并不破坏它的形式，而是利用它的形式来发展新的东西。在我国的经济流通中，不仅商品是这样，而且货币也是这样，连银行也是这样，银行失去自己旧的机能并取得了新的机能，同时保持着旧的形式而为社会主义制度所利用。
    如果从形式上的观点，从现象表面过程的观点来看待问题，就会得出不正确的结论，仿佛资本主义的范畴在我国经济中也保持着效力。如果用马克思主义的分析方法来看待问题，即把经济过程的内容和它的形式、把深处的发展过程和表面现象严格地区别开来，那就可以得出一个唯一正确的结论，即资本主义的旧范畴在我国保留下来的，主要是形式，是外表，实质上这些范畴在我国已经根本改变得与社会主义国民经济发展的需要相适合了。
    关于第四点。
    你断定说，价值法则对于在农业中所出产的、依照采购价格出售给国家的“生产资料”的价格，发生着调节的影响。你在这里所指的是例如棉花这种原料的“生产资料”。在这里你还可以再加上亚麻、羊毛及其他农业原料。
    应该首先指出，在这种情形下，农业所生产的并不是“生产资料”，而是生产资料之一的原料。不能玩弄“生产资料”这个术语。当马克思主义者说生产资料的生产时，首先是指生产工具的生产，——马克思把这叫做“机械的劳动资料，其总和可称为生产的骨骼和筋肉的系统”，这个系统组成“社会生产一定时代的作为特征的标志”。把一部分生产资料（原料）和包括生产工具的整个生产资料等量齐观，就是违反马克思主义，因为马克思主义认为，和其他一切生产资料来比，生产工具是具有决定作用的。谁都知道，原料本身不能生产生产工具，虽然某几种原料也是生产生产工具所必需的材料，可是没有生产工具是不能生产任何原料的。
    其次，价值法则对农业中所生产的原料的价格的影响，是否像你诺特京同志所断言的那样，是具有调节作用的呢？如果我国存在着农业原料价格的“自由”涨跌，如果竞争和生产无政府状态的法则在我国发生作用，如果我国没有计划经济，如果原料的生产不是由计划来调节的，那末，价值法则的影响就会是有调节作用的了。但是，因为在我国的国民经济体系中，并没有这些“如果”，所以价值法则对于农业原料价格的影响无论如何不会是有调节作用的。第一，我国农业原料的价格是固定的，由计划规定的，而不是“自由”的。第二，农业原料的生产规模并不是由自发的力量、不是由什么偶然的因素来决定，而是由计划来决定的。第三，为生产农业原料所必需的生产工具，不是集中在个别人或个别集团手中，而是集中在国家手中。既然这样，还有什么价值法则的调节作用呢？结果，价值法则本身也是由社会主义生产所特有的上述事实来调节的。
    因此，不能否认，价值法则是影响农业原料价格的形成的，它是这方面的因素之一。但是尤其不能否认，这种影响并不起调节作用，也不可能起调节作用。
    关于第五点。
    说到社会主义国民经济的赢利，我在“意见”中曾反驳某些同志，这些同志肯定说，既然我国计划性的国民经济不大重视赢利的企业，并且容许不赢利的企业也和这些企业并存，仿佛计划性的国民经济抹煞经济中的赢利性这个原则本身。在“意见”中说，个别企业和个别生产部门的赢利是决不能和社会主义生产所给予我们的那个高级形式的赢利相比的，因为社会主义生产使我们避免生产过剩的危机，并保证我们的生产不断提高。
    但是，如果从此得出结论说，个别企业和个别生产部门的赢利是没有特别价值的，所以不值得加以重视，那就不对了。这当然是不对的。个别企业和个别生产部门的赢利，从发展我国生产的观点来说，是有巨大意义的。无论在计划建设或计划生产时，这都是应该注意到的。这是我国现今发展阶段上经济活动方面的起码知识。
    关于第六点。
    不知道应该怎样了解你这个关于资本主义的说法：“形式大大改变了的扩大的生产”。应该说，这样的而且还是扩大的生产，是世界上所没有的。
    显然，在世界市场已经分裂和主要资本主义国家（美、英、法）攫取世界资源的范围开始缩小了的时候，资本主义发展的循环性质——生产的增长和减缩——一定还会存在。不过，这些国家生产的增长将在缩小的基础上进行，因为这些国家的生产量将要减缩。
    关于第七点。
    世界资本主义体系的总危机，是在第一次世界大战时期，特别是在苏联脱离资本主义体系之后开始的。这是总危机的第一阶段。在第二次世界大战时期，特别是在欧洲和亚洲的各人民民主国家脱离资本主义体系之后，展开了总危机的第二阶段。第一次世界大战时期的第一次危机和第二次世界大战时期的第二次危机，应该看做不是个别的、彼此隔离的独立危机，而是世界资本主义体系总危机发展的两个阶段。
    世界资本主义的总危机是否仅仅是政治的或仅仅是经济的危机呢？既不是前者，也不是后者。它是世界资本主义体系中既包括经济、也包括政治的总的即全面的危机。同时也就很清楚，这种危机的基础，一方面是资本主义世界经济体系的瓦解现象日益加剧，另一方面是脱离资本主义的各国——苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的经济实力日益增长。  约·斯大林  一九五二年四月二十一日
    关于Л·Д·雅罗申柯同志的错误
    今年三月二十日，雅罗申柯同志写了一封信分送给联共（布）中央政治局各委员，说到在大家知道的十一月讨论会上所讨论过的几个经济问题。他在这封信中申诉说，在讨论会的一些总结性的主要文件中以及在斯大林同志的“意见”中，雅罗申柯同志的“观点没有得到任何反映”。此外，在这封短信中还有雅罗申柯同志的建议：请准许他在一年或一年半内编写出“社会主义政治经济学”，并给他两个助手来作这一工作。
    我以为，必须从本质上来考察雅罗申柯同志的申诉和他的建议。
    我们先从他的申诉开始。
    究竟在上述文件中没有得到任何反映的雅罗申柯同志的“观点”，是什么呢？
    一、雅罗申柯同志的主要错误
    如果用一两句话来评定雅罗申柯同志的观点，那就应该说，他的观点是非马克思主义的，因而是极端错误的。
    雅罗申柯同志的主要错误是，他在生产力和生产关系在社会发展中的作用这个问题上，离开了马克思主义，过分夸大了生产力的作用，同样也就过分缩小了生产关系的作用，竟至宣布社会主义制度下的生产关系是生产力的一部分。
    雅罗申柯同志同意承认生产关系在“对抗的阶级矛盾”条件下有某种作用，因为在那里，生产关系“是与生产力的发展相矛盾的”。但是他把这种作用限制为消极的作用，限制为阻碍生产力发展和束缚生产力发展的因素的作用。生产关系的其他机能、任何积极的机能，雅罗申柯同志是没有看到的。
    至于说到已经没有“对抗的阶级矛盾”而且生产关系“再也不与生产力的发展相矛盾的”社会主义制度时，雅罗申柯同志便认为，在这里，生产关系的任何独立的作用都在消失，生产关系不再是发展的重大因素，而且被生产力所吞没，犹如部分被整体吞没一样。雅罗申柯同志说，在社会主义制度下，“人们的生产关系包括在生产力的组织中，作为这种组织的一个手段、一个成分。”（见雅罗申柯同志给中央政治局的信）
    这样一来，社会主义政治经济学的主要任务又是什么呢？雅罗申柯同志回答说：“所以，社会主义政治经济学的主要问题不在于研究社会主义社会中人们的生产关系，而在于制定和发挥社会生产中生产力组织的科学理论、国民经济发展计划化的理论。”（见雅罗申柯同志在全体讨论会上的讲话）
    这的确也就说明，雅罗申柯同志对社会主义制度下的这些经济问题，如我国经济中各种不同形式的所有制的存在、商品流通、价值法则等等，并不感到兴趣，认为这都只能引起烦琐学派式的争论的次要问题。他公然宣称，在他的社会主义政治经济学中，“关于社会主义政治经济学某些范畴——价值、商品、货币、信贷等等——的作用的争论，即在我国常常带着烦琐学派式的性质的争论，将用关于社会生产中生产力合理组织的健全议论以及这种组织的科学论证来代替。”（见雅罗申柯同志在分组讨论会上的讲话）
    这样，就是没有经济问题的政治经济学了。
    雅罗申柯同志以为，只要安排好“生产力的合理组织”，就可以没有特别困难地从社会主义过渡到共产主义了。他认为，为了过渡到共产主义，这已经十分够了。他公然宣称：
    “在社会主义制度下争取建成共产主义社会的主要斗争，是归结为在社会生产中正确组织生产力和合理使用生产力的斗争。”（见雅罗申柯同志在全体讨论会上的讲话）雅罗申柯同志郑重宣称：“共产主义——这就是社会生产中生产力的最高科学组织。”
    这样，“生产力的合理组织”就把共产主义制度的本质包括无遗了。
    雅罗申柯同志从这一切便作出结论说，对于一切社会形态，不可能有统一的政治经济学，而应该有两种政治经济学：一种是关于社会主义社会以前各种社会形态的政治经济学，其对象是研究人们的生产关系；另一种是关于社会主义制度的政治经济学，其对象应当不是研究生产关系即经济关系，而是研究生产力合理组织的问题。
    雅罗申柯同志的观点就是这样。
    对于这种观点可以讲些什么呢？
    第一，说生产关系在社会历史中的作用只限于是束缚生产力发展的阻碍作用，这是不对的。当马克思主义者讲到生产关系的阻碍作用时，他们所指的并不是任何生产关系，而只是已经不能适合生产力发展、因而阻碍生产力发展的旧生产关系。但是，除了旧生产关系以外，大家知道，还有代替旧生产关系的新生产关系。可不可以说，新生产关系的作用归结为阻碍生产力的作用呢？不，不可以。恰恰相反，新生产关系是这样一种主要的和有决定性的力量，它真正决定生产力进一步的而且是强大的发展，没有这种新的生产关系，生产力就注定要萎靡下去，如像现在资本主义国家中的情形一样。
    谁也不能否认，我们苏联工业的生产力在几个五年计划中，有巨大的发展。但是，如果我们没有在一九一七年十月用新的社会主义的生产关系来代替旧的资本主义的生产关系，那就不会有这样的发展。没有我国生产关系即经济关系中的这种变革，我国的生产力就会萎靡下去，如像它现时在资本主义国家中萎靡的情形一样。
    谁也不能否认，我国农业的生产力在最近二十年至二十五年中，有巨大的发展。但是，如果我们在三十年代没有用新的集体化的生产关系来代替农村中旧的资本主义的生产关系，那就不会有这样的发展。没有这种生产的变革，我国农业的生产力就会萎靡下去，如像它现时在资本主义国家中萎靡的情形一样。
    当然，新的生产关系不能永远是新的，而且也不永远是新的，它开始变旧，并与生产力的进一步发展发生矛盾，而开始失去其为生产力的主要推进者的作用，并变成生产力的阻碍者。那时候，就出现新生产关系来代替这种已经变旧了的生产关系，新生产关系的作用就是充当生产力进一步发展的主要推进者。
    生产关系从生产力阻碍者的作用发展到生产力主要推进者的作用，以及从生产力主要推进者的作用发展到生产力阻碍者的作用，——这样一种发展的特性，是马克思主义唯物辩证法的主要因素之一。这是现在一切初学马克思主义的人都知道的。原来雅罗申柯同志却不知道这一点。
    第二，说生产关系即经济关系的独立作用在社会主义制度下是在消失，说生产关系是在被生产力吞没着，说社会生产在社会主义制度下是归结为生产力的组织，这是不对的。马克思主义是把社会生产看作一个整体，它具有两个不可分割的方面：社会生产力（社会对自然力的关系，社会在与自然力作斗争中来取得必要的物质资料）和生产关系（人们在生产过程中的相互关系）。这是社会生产的两个不同的方面，虽然它们是不可分割地互相联系着的。正因为它们是社会生产的两个不同的方面，所以它们能够互相影响。硬说这两个方面中有一个可以被另一个吞没而变成它的组成部分，就是极严重地违反马克思主义。
    马克思说：
    “人们在生产中不仅影响自然，而且也互相影响。他们如果不以一定方式联合起来进行共同活动并互相交换自己的活动，便不能从事生产。为了从事生产，人们就发生一定的联系和关系，而且只有通过这些社会联系和关系，才有人们对自然的关系，才有生产。”（见“马克思恩格斯全集”，俄文本，第五卷，第四二九页）
    可见，社会生产是由两个方面组成，这两个方面虽然是不可分割地互相联系着，但却反映两种不同的关系，即人们对自然的关系（生产力）和人们在生产过程中的相互关系（生产关系）。只有具备生产的这两方面，才能有社会生产，——不管在社会主义制度下或其他社会形态下都是一样。
    大概，雅罗申柯同志是不十分同意马克思的。他认为马克思的这个原理是不适用于社会主义制度的。正因为如此，所以他把社会主义政治经济学问题归结为合理组织生产力的问题，而抛开了生产关系即经济关系，并使生产力与生产关系脱节。
    这样，在雅罗申柯同志那里，就不是马克思主义的政治经济学，而是波格丹诺夫的“普遍组织科学”之类的东西了。
    这样，雅罗申柯同志在采纳了生产力是生产中最活动、最革命的力量这个正确思想以后，却把这个思想弄到了荒谬的地步，竟否认社会主义制度下生产关系即经济关系的作用；而且，本来是生气蓬勃的社会生产，他却弄成了片面的和空洞的生产工艺学，即布哈林的“社会组织技术”之类的东西了。
    马克思说：
    “人们在自己生活的社会生产中（即在人们生活所必需的物质资料的生产中——斯大林注），彼此间发生一定的、必要的、不以他们的意志为转移的关系，即与他们当时的物质生产力发展程度相适合的生产关系。这些生产关系的总和就组成社会的经济结构，即法律的和政治的上层建筑所借以建立起来，而且有一定的社会意识形式与之相适应的现实基础。”（见“政治经济学批判”序言）
    这就是说，每个社会形态，连社会主义社会也在内，都有自己的由人们生产关系的总和所构成的经济基础。于是发生一个问题：在雅罗申柯同志那里，究竟社会主义制度的经济基础是怎样的呢？大家知道，雅罗申柯同志已经消灭了社会主义制度下的生产关系这个多少带独立性的领域，而把生产关系剩下的一点残余归并到生产力组织之内。试问，社会主义制度有没有它自己的经济基础呢？看起来，既然生产关系这一多少独立的力量在社会主义制度下已经消失，那末社会主义制度只好没有自己的经济基础了。
    这样，就是没有自己经济基础的社会主义制度。这是相当可笑的事情……
    一般讲来，没有自己经济基础的社会制度是不是可能的呢？大概，雅罗申柯同志认为是可能的。但是，马克思主义却认为，这样的社会制度在世界上是没有的。
    最后，说共产主义是生产力的合理组织，说生产力的合理组织把共产主义制度的本质包括无遗了，说只要合理地组织生产力，就可以没有特别困难地过渡到共产主义，这是不对的。在我国的文献中，有共产主义的另一个定义、共产主义的另一个公式、即列宁的公式：“共产主义是苏维埃政权加全国电气化。”看起来，雅罗申柯同志不喜欢列宁的公式，于是用他自己杜撰的公式“共产主义——这就是社会生产中生产力的最高科学组织”，来代替列宁的公式。
    第一，谁也不明白，雅罗申柯同志所吹嘘的这个生产力的“最高科学”组织或“合理”组织是什么？这组织的具体内容是什么？雅罗申柯同志在全体讨论会和分组讨论会上的讲话中，在给中央政治局委员们的信中，几十次重复这个神话般的公式，然而他无论在那一个地方，都没有试图用片言只字来说明这个仿佛把共产主义制度的本质包括无遗的生产力的“合理组织”，究竟应该怎样来了解。
    第二，如果对这两个公式加以选择的话，那末应该抛弃的，就不是唯一正确的列宁的公式，而是雅罗申柯同志的所谓公式，他这公式显然是臆造的和非马克思主义的，是从波格丹诺夫的武器库——“普遍组织科学”中拿来的东西。雅罗申柯同志以为，只要做到合理地组织生产力，就能获得丰富的产品并过渡到共产主义，就能从“按劳取酬”的公式过渡到“各取所需”的公式。这是大错特错的，这暴露了他对于社会主义经济发展的法则一窍不通。雅罗申柯同志过于简单地、小孩般简单地想像从社会主义过渡到共产主义的条件。雅罗申柯同志不了解，如果让集体农庄集团所有制、商品流通等等经济事实仍然存在，那就既不能获得能满足社会一切需要的丰富产品，也不能过渡到“各取所需”的公式。雅罗申柯同志不了解：在过渡到“各取所需”的公式以前，社会必须经过一系列的经济改造和文化改造阶段，在这些阶段中，劳动将在社会成员面前从仅仅维持生活的手段变成为生活的第一需要，而公有制将变成为社会存在的不可动摇和不可侵犯的基础。
    为了准备在实际上而不是在宣言上过渡到共产主义，至少必须实现三个基本的先决条件。
    第一，必须切实加以保证的，不是神话般的生产力的“合理组织”，而是全部社会生产的不断增长，而生产资料生产的增长要占优先地位。生产资料生产的增长之所以必须占优先地位，不仅是因为这种生产应当保证自己的企业以及国民经济其他一切部门的企业所需要的装备，而且是因为没有这种生产就根本不可能实现扩大再生产。
    第二，必须用实行起来有利于集体农庄因而也有利于整个社会的逐渐过渡的办法，来把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，并且也用逐渐过渡的办法使产品交换制来代替商品流通，使中央政权或其他某个社会经济中心能够为了社会福利来掌握社会生产的全部产品。
    雅罗申柯同志断定说，在社会主义制度下，社会的生产关系和生产力之间没有任何矛盾。这是错误的。当然，我国现今的生产关系是处在这样一个时期，它完全适合于生产力的增长，一日千里地把生产力向前推进。但是，如果以此自满，以为在我国生产力和生产关系之间不存在任何矛盾，那就不正确了。因为生产关系的发展是落后于并且将来也会落后于生产力的发展，所以矛盾无疑是有的，而且将来也会有的。在领导机关的正确政策下，这些矛盾就不会变成对立，而这样也就不会弄到社会的生产关系和生产力发生冲突。如果我们执行类似雅罗申柯同志所推荐的不正确的政策，那就会是另一种情形了。在这种场合下，冲突将是不可避免的，我国的生产关系可能变成生产力进一步发展的极严重的阻碍者。
    因此，领导机关的任务在于及时地看出日益增长的矛盾，并及时地采取办法，使生产关系适合于生产力的增长，来克服这种矛盾。这首先是与集体农庄集团所有制、商品流通这种经济现象有关的。当然，目前这些现象是在被我们有成效地利用来发展社会主义经济，而且它们也在给我国社会带来毫无疑问的利益。无疑地，它们在最近的将来也将带来利益。但同时这些现象已在开始阻碍我国生产力的强大发展，因为它们正在阻碍这种由国家计划化来完全包括全部国民经济、特别是包括农业的事业，如果看不出这点，那就是不可原谅的盲目了。不容置疑，愈向前去，这些现象就会愈加阻碍我国生产力的进一步增长。所以，任务就在于要逐渐把集体农庄所有制转为全民所有制以及也是逐渐用产品交换制代替商品流通，这样来消灭这些矛盾。
    第三，必须使社会达到这样高度的文化发展，保证社会一切成员全面发展他们的体力和智力，使社会成员能获得足以成为社会发展的积极活动家的教育，能自由地选择职业，而不致由于现存的劳动分工而终身束缚于某一种职业。
    为了做到这点，究竟需要什么呢？
    如果认为用不着大大改变现今的劳动状况，便可以达到社会成员的这种强大的文化高涨，那就不正确了。为了做到这点，首先需要把每天的劳动时间至少缩短到六小时，然后再缩短到五小时。这是使社会成员有充分的自由时间来获得全面教育所必需的。其次，为了做到这点，需要实行普及义务的综合技术教育，这是使社会成员有可能自由选择职业而不致终身束缚于某一种职业所必需的。再次，为了做到这点，需要根本改善居住条件，把工人和职员的实际工资至少提高一倍，也许还要更多，办法是不仅直接提高货币工资，而且特别重要的，是继续不断地降低日用品价格。
    准备过渡到共产主义的基本条件就是这样。
    只有把这一切先决条件全部实现之后，才可以希望，劳动将在社会成员面前，从累赘变成“生活的第一需要”（马克思），“劳动从沉重的负担变成愉快”（恩格斯），公有制将被社会全体成员看作是社会存在的不可动摇和不可侵犯的基础。
    只有把这一切先决条件全部实现之后，才可以从社会主义的公式“各尽所能，按劳取酬”，过渡到共产主义的公式“各尽所能，各取所需”。
    这将是从一种经济即社会主义经济到另一种更高的经济即共产主义经济的根本过渡。
    可见，从社会主义过渡到共产主义的事业，并不像雅罗申柯同志所想像的那样简单。
    企图把这全部复杂的和多样性的事业、需要有极重大经济变更的事业归结为“生产力的合理组织”，像雅罗申柯同志所做的那样，就等于以波格丹诺夫谬论来偷换马克思主义。
    二、雅罗申柯同志的其他错误
    一、雅罗申柯同志从自己不正确的观点出发，作出了关于政治经济学的性质和对象的不正确的结论。
    雅罗申柯同志认为每一社会形态有它自己的独特的经济法则。他从这点出发，就否认有论述一切社会形态的统一的政治经济学的必要。但他是完全不对的，他在这里是与恩格斯、列宁这样的马克思主义者背道而驰了。
    恩格斯说，政治经济学是“研究人类各种不同社会中借以进行生产和交换，及与此相适应，借以经常进行产品分配的条件和形式的科学”（“反杜林论”）。因此，政治经济学所研究的，不是某一种社会形态的经济发展法则，而是各种不同的社会形态的经济发展法则。
    大家知道，列宁是十分同意这点的，他在批判布哈林的小册子“过渡时期的经济”时说，布哈林把政治经济学的作用范围局限于商品生产，首先是局限于资本主义生产，这是不对的；他同时指出，在这里，布哈林是“比恩格斯后退了一步”。
    政治经济学教科书未定稿中所提供的政治经济学的定义，是与此十分符合的。在这未定稿中说：政治经济学是研究“人类社会各个不同发展阶段上社会物质资料的生产和分配法则”的科学。
    这是很明白的。各种不同的社会形态在它的经济发展中，不仅服从自己特有的经济法则，而且还服从一切社会形态所共有的经济法则，例如，在单一的社会生产中生产力和生产关系的统一的法则，在一切社会形态发展过程中生产力和生产关系间的关系法则。所以，各个社会形态不仅以自己特有的法则互相分开着，而且以一切社会形态所共有的经济法则互相联系着。
    恩格斯说得完全对：“要全面地对资产阶级政治经济学进行这个批判，只认识生产、交换和分配的资本主义形式是不够的。还必须——那怕是大体上——研究和比较资本主义形式以前的各种形式或较为不发达的国家中与资本主义形式并存的各种形式。”（“反杜林论”）
    看起来，在这里，在这个问题上，雅罗申柯同志是与布哈林互相呼应起来了。
    其次，雅罗申柯同志断定说：在他的“社会主义政治经济学”中，“政治经济学的各个范畴——价值、商品、货币、信贷等等——将用关于社会生产中生产力合理组织的健全议论来代替”；因而这种政治经济学的对象不是社会主义的生产关系，而是“制定和发挥生产力组织的科学理论、国民经济计划化的理论等等”；社会主义制度下的生产关系丧失着自己独立的作用，并被生产力吞没着而成为它的组成部分。
    必须说，在我们这里还没有一个发了疯的“马克思主义者”讲过这种胡说八道的话。要知道，没有经济问题即生产问题的社会主义政治经济学是什么意思呢？难道世界上有这样的政治经济学吗？在社会主义政治经济学中，用生产力组织问题来代替经济问题，这是什么意思呢？这就是取消社会主义政治经济学。雅罗申柯同志正好是这样作的，——他在取消社会主义政治经济学。在这里，他是与布哈林完全结合起来了。布哈林说过，资本主义消灭时，政治经济学也必定随着消灭。雅罗申柯同志没有这样说，却是这样作，作这种取消社会主义政治经济学的事情。诚然，他同时装出不完全同意布哈林的样子，但这是诡计，而且是不值一文的诡计。事实上，他作的就是布哈林所鼓吹而为列宁所反对的这件事。雅罗申柯同志是在跟着布哈林的尾巴跑。
    其次，雅罗申柯同志把社会主义政治经济学问题归结为生产力合理组织的问题，归结为国民经济计划化的问题等等。但是他大错特错了。生产力合理组织的问题、国民经济计划化的问题等等，并不是政治经济学的对象，而是领导机关经济政策的对象。这是两种不同的领域，不能混为一谈。雅罗申柯同志把这两种不同的东西混淆起来，所以他碰壁了。政治经济学是研究人们生产关系发展的法则。经济政策是由此作出实际结论，把它们具体化，在这上面建立自己的日常工作。把经济政策的问题堆压在政治经济学上，就是戕害这门科学。
    政治经济学的对象是人们的生产关系、即经济关系。这里包括：（甲）生产资料的所有制形式；（乙）由此产生的各种不同社会集团在生产中的地位以及它们的相互关系，或如马克思所说的，“互相交换自己的活动”；（丙）完全以生产关系为转移的产品分配形式。这一切共同构成政治经济学的对象。这个定义中缺少恩格斯定义内的“交换”这个术语。其所以缺少，是因为“交换”通常被许多人了解为不是一切社会形态而只是某些社会形态所特有的商品交换，这有时候就会引起误会，虽然恩格斯所说的“交换”这个术语不仅是指商品交换。但是，恩格斯用“交换”这个术语所指的东西，显然已包含在上述定义中，作为其组成部分。因而，就其内容讲来，政治经济学对象的这个定义是与恩格斯的定义完全相符合的。
    二、当人们谈到某一社会形态的基本经济法则时，他们通常是从下列这点出发的：社会形态不能有几个基本经济法则，它只能有某一个基本经济法则来作为基本法则。要不然的话，每个社会形态就会有几个基本经济法则，这就与基本法则的概念本身相矛盾。然而，雅罗申柯同志并不同意这点。他认为，社会主义的基本经济法则可以不是一个，而是几个。这是难于相信的，但这是事实。他在全体讨论会上的讲话中说：
    “社会生产和再生产的物质总量的多少和对比，是由被吸引到社会生产中的劳动力增长的事实和前途来决定的。这是社会主义社会的基本经济法则，它制约着社会主义制度下社会生产和再生产的结构。”
    这是他的社会主义的第一个基本经济法则。
    雅罗申柯同志在同一讲话中宣称：
    “第一部类和第二部类的对比关系在社会主义社会中是由生产资料生产的需要所制约的，这种生产的规模是由被吸引到社会生产中的一切能劳动的人口的多少来决定。这是社会主义的基本经济法则，同时这是我国宪法从苏联人的劳动权引伸出的要求。”
    这是所谓社会主义的第二个基本经济法则。
    最后，雅罗申柯同志在给中央政治局委员们的信中宣称：
    “从这点出发，社会主义基本经济法则的特点和要求，在我看来，可以大致表述如下：社会的物质和文化生活条件的生产之不断增长和日益完善。”
    这已经是社会主义的第三个基本经济法则了。
    这一切法则都是社会主义的基本经济法则呢，或者仅仅它们中间的一个才是呢？如果是它们中间的一个，那末究竟是那一个呢？对于这些问题，雅罗申柯同志在最后给中央政治局委员们的信中并没有给予回答。他在给中央政治局委员们的信中表述社会主义的基本经济法则时，想必他“忘记了”在三个月前全体讨论会上的讲话中他已经表述过社会主义的其他两个基本经济法则，大概他以为别人不会注意这个很不高明的手法。但他的打算显然是落空了。
    我们就假定，雅罗申柯同志所表述的前两个社会主义基本经济法则已不存在，就假定雅罗申柯同志现在认为在他给中央政治局委员们的信中所述明的第三个公式是社会主义的基本经济法则。我们来看一看雅罗申柯同志的这封信吧。
    雅罗申柯同志在这封信中说，他不同意斯大林同志在“意见”中所提出的社会主义基本经济法则的定义。他说：
    “在这个定义中主要的是‘保证最大限度地满足整个社会……的需要’。在这里，表明生产是达到这个主要目的、即满足需要的手段。这个定义使人有根据认为，你所表述的社会主义的基本经济法则不是从生产占首要地位出发，而是从消费占首要地位出发。”
    显然，雅罗申柯同志完全没有了解问题的本质，并且看不见，消费或者是生产占首要地位的议论是与问题无关的。当人们讲到某种社会过程对其他过程占首要地位时，他们的出发点通常是：这两种过程多少是同一类的。可以而且必须说，生产资料的生产对消费资料的生产占首要地位，因为在这两种场合下，我们所说的都是生产，因而它们多少是同一类的。但决不能说消费对生产占首要地位或生产对消费占首要地位，如果这样说，那就是不正确的。因为生产和消费是两个完全不相同的领域，诚然，这是两个互相联系着、但毕竟各不相同的领域。雅罗申柯同志显然不了解，这里所说的不是消费或生产占首要地位，而是社会给社会生产定出什么目的，它使社会生产——比方说——在社会主义制度下服从于什么任务。因此，雅罗申柯同志关于“生产是社会主义社会的生活基础，犹如是其他任何社会的生活基础一样”的说法，也是与问题完全无关的。雅罗申柯同志忘记了，人们不是为生产而生产，而是为满足自己的需要而生产。他忘记了，跟满足社会需要脱节的生产是会衰退和灭亡的。
    可不可以一般地讲社会主义生产或资本主义生产的目的，一般地讲资本主义生产或社会主义生产所服从的任务呢？我以为是可以而且应当的。
    马克思说：
    “资本主义生产的直接目的，不是生产商品，而是生产剩余价值或在发展形式下的利润；不是生产产品，而是生产剩余产品。从这个观点看来，劳动本身只是在它给资本创造利润或剩余产品的情形下，才是生产的劳动。只要工人不创造这种东西，他的劳动就是不生产的劳动。因而，被使用的生产劳动量，只是在由于有这劳动量——或相当于这劳动量——而剩余劳动量得以增长的情形下，才使资本感到兴趣；只是在这样的情形下，我们叫做必要的劳动时间才是必要的东西。只要劳动不产生这样的成果，那它就是多余的，就是应当被停止的。
    “资本主义生产的目的，始终是以最小限度的预付资本，来创造最大限度的剩余价值或最大限度的剩余产品；既然这种结果不能由工人的过度劳动来获得，资本就产生这样的倾向，即力求以尽量少的费用来生产该产品，——力求节省劳动力和费用……
    “从工人在资本主义生产中的实际地位来了解，工人本身只是生产的资料，而不是目的本身，也不是生产的目的。”（见“剩余价值论”，第二卷，第二部）
    马克思这些话之特别卓越，不仅一方面简要而精确地判定了资本主义生产的目的，而且另一方面指出了应当向社会主义生产提出的主要目的，主要任务。
    因此，资本主义生产的目的是取得利润，至于消费，只有在保证完成取得利润这一任务的情形下，才对于资本主义是需要的。在这以外，消费问题对于资本主义就失去意义。人及其需要就从视野中消逝。
    社会主义生产的目的是什么呢？社会主义制度下社会生产应当服从的主要任务又是什么呢？
    社会主义生产的目的不是利润，而是人及其需要，即满足人的物质和文化的需要。社会主义生产的目的，如在斯大林同志“意见”中所说的那样，是“保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要”。
    雅罗申柯同志以为这里所说的是消费对生产“占首要地位”。这当然是糊涂想法。其实，我们这里的问题不是消费占首要地位，而是社会主义生产服从于它的主要目的——保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    因此，保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要，就是社会主义生产的目的；在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善，就是达到这一目的的手段。
    社会主义的基本经济法则就是如此。
    雅罗申柯同志想保持生产对消费的所谓“占首要地位”，于是断定说：“社会主义的基本经济法则”就是“社会的物质和文化条件的生产不断增长和日益完善”。这是完全不对的。雅罗申柯同志粗暴地歪曲了和损害了斯大林同志“意见”中所表述的公式。在雅罗申柯同志那里，却把生产从手段变成了目的，而保证最大限度地满足社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要，则被取消了。结果弄成生产增长是为了生产增长，生产是目的本身，而人及其需要就从雅罗申柯同志的视野里消失了。
    所以，作为社会主义生产目的的人消失，雅罗申柯同志“概念”里的马克思主义的最后残余也随之消失，这是毫不奇怪的。
    这样，在雅罗申柯同志那里，就弄成了不是生产对消费“占首要地位”，而好像是资产阶级思想体系对马克思主义思想体系“占首要地位”这类的东西了。
    三、马克思的再生产理论的问题是要单独谈一谈的。雅罗申柯同志断定说，马克思的再生产理论仅仅是资本主义的再生产理论，它不包含对于其他社会形态——其中也对于社会主义社会形态——能发生效力的什么东西。他说：
    “把马克思给资本主义经济制定的再生产公式搬到社会主义的社会生产上来，是对马克思学说作教条主义理解的结果，而且是与他的学说的本质相矛盾的。”（见雅罗申柯同志在全体讨论会上的讲话）
    其次，他断定说：“马克思的再生产公式不符合于社会主义社会的经济法则，不能作为研究社会主义再生产的基础。”（同上）
    讲到马克思在其中规定了生产资料的生产（第一部类）和消费资料的生产（第二部类）之间的一定对比关系的简单再生产理论时，雅罗申柯同志说：
    “第一部类和第二部类之间的对比关系，在社会主义社会中不是由马克思的‘第一部类的V＋M和第二部类的C’这个公式所制约的。在社会主义条件下，上述第一部类和第二部类在发展中的相互联系是不应当存在的。”（同上）
    他断定说：“马克思所制定的关于第一部类和第二部类间的对比关系的理论，在我国社会主义条件下是不能适用的，因为马克思这个理论的基础是资本主义经济及其法则。”（见雅罗申柯同志给中央政治局委员们的信）
    雅罗申柯同志就是这样斥责马克思的再生产理论。
    当然，马克思由于研究资本主义生产法则的结果而制定出来的再生产理论，是反映资本主义生产的特点，自然也就具有资本主义商品价值关系的形式。不这样也是不可能的。但是，在马克思的再生产理论中，如果仅仅看到这个形式，而看不出它的基础，看不出它那不仅对于资本主义社会形态发生效力的基本内容，就是一点也不懂得这个理论。假如雅罗申柯同志在这个问题上有什么理解的话，那末他也就会懂得这个显而易见的真理：马克思的再生产公式决不只限于反映资本主义生产的特点；它同时还包含有对于一切社会形态——特别是对于社会主义社会形态——发生效力的许多关于再生产的基本原理。马克思的再生产理论的这些基本原理，类如关于社会生产之分为生产资料的生产与消费资料的生产的原理；关于在扩大再生产下生产资料生产的增长占优先地位的原理；关于第一部类和第二部类之间的对比关系的原理；关于剩余产品是积累的唯一源泉的原理；关于社会基金的形成和用途的原理；关于积累是扩大再生产的唯一源泉的原理，——所有马克思的再生产理论的这一切基本原理，不仅对于资本主义社会形态是有效的，而且任何一个社会主义社会在计划国民经济时，不运用这些原理也是不行的。值得注意的，是雅罗申柯同志本人虽然如此高傲地蔑视马克思的“再生产公式”，但他在讨论社会主义再生产问题时却不得不再三再四地去求助于这些公式。
    列宁、马克思是如何看待这个问题呢？
    列宁批判布哈林的“过渡时期的经济”一书的意见，是大家都知道的。在这些意见中，大家知道，列宁承认，马克思关于第一部类和第二部类的对比关系的公式，也就是雅罗申柯同志所极力反对的公式，不论对于社会主义或“纯粹共产主义”、即共产主义第二阶段，都是有效的。
    至于马克思，那末大家知道，他不喜欢离开对资本主义生产法则的研究，他在自己的“资本论”中，并没有研究过他的再生产公式是否适用于社会主义的问题。然而，他在“资本论”第二卷第二十章“第一部类的不变资本”这一节中，论述第一部类的产品在这一部类内部的交换时，曾顺便指出，这一部类的产品的交换，在社会主义制度下，也会像在资本主义生产下那样不断地进行。马克思说：
    “如果生产是社会公有的而不是资本主义的，那末很明显，第一部类的产品，为了再生产的目的，将作为生产资料同样不断地重新分配于这一部类的各个生产部门之间：一部分直接留在生产它自己的生产部门，另一部分则转到另一些生产部门，于是在这一部类各个生产部门之间就建立起不断对流的运动。”（见马克思“资本论”，俄文本，第八版，第二卷，第三○七页）
    因此，虽然马克思研究的是资本主义生产法则，但他决不认为他的再生产理论仅仅对于资本主义生产才是有效的。恰恰相反，他显然认为他的再生产理论对于社会主义生产也能是有效的。
    应该指出，马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中，在分析社会主义经济和到共产主义的过渡时期的经济时，是从他的再生产理论的基本原理出发的，显然他认为这些基本原理对于共产主义制度是一定适用的。
    也应该指出，恩格斯在他的“反杜林论”中，批判杜林的“社会制度”和说明社会主义制度的经济时，也是从马克思的再生产理论的基本原理出发的，认为这些基本原理对于共产主义制度是一定适用的。
    事实就是如此。
    结果，在这里，在再生产问题上，雅罗申柯同志虽然对于马克思的“公式”发出放肆的议论，却又碰了壁。
    四、雅罗申柯同志在给中央政治局委员们的信的末尾，建议委托他编写“社会主义政治经济学”。他写道：
    “根据我在全体讨论会和分组讨论会上以及这封信中所表述的社会主义政治经济学的对象的定义，应用马克思主义的辩证方法，我能在一年内，至多一年半，在两个人的帮助下，从理论上来解决社会主义政治经济学的各种基本问题，阐明马克思主义的、列宁斯大林的社会主义政治经济学理论，这个理论定会把这一科学变成人民为共产主义而斗争的有效武器。”
    不能不承认，雅罗申柯同志所犯的毛病并不是谦虚。甚至，使用某些文学家的笔法，可以说：“而是恰恰相反。”
    上面已经讲过，雅罗申柯同志把社会主义政治经济学和领导机关的经济政策混为一谈。他所认为的社会主义经济学的对象——生产力的合理组织、国民经济的计划化、社会基金的形成等等——并不是社会主义政治经济学的对象，而是领导机关经济政策的对象。
    我已不必说，雅罗申柯同志所犯的严重错误以及他的非马克思主义的“观点”，使我们不能给予他这样的委托。×××结论：
    （一）雅罗申柯同志对讨论会领导人的控诉是没有意义的，因为讨论会领导人是马克思主义者，以不能在自己总结性的文件中反映雅罗申柯同志的非马克思主义的“观点”。
    （二）对于雅罗申柯同志请委托他编写社会主义政治经济学的请求，不能认为是郑重的，至少是因为他这请求中充满着赫列斯达可夫〔注〕的气味。  约·斯大林  一九五二年五月二十二日
    〔注〕赫列斯达可夫是果戈理著名喜剧“巡按”中的主角。他是一个招摇撞骗、虚伪轻浮、厚颜无耻的典型人物。——译者
    答萨宁娜和温什尔两同志
    我收到了你们的信。可以看出，你们是在深刻地认真地研究我国的经济问题。信中有不少正确的说法和有意思的见解。但除此以外，信中也有一些严重的理论上的错误。在这封回信中，我想只来谈谈这些错误。
    一、关于社会主义经济法则的性质问题
    萨宁娜和温什尔两同志断定说：“仅仅由于从事物质生产的苏联人的自觉行动，才产生出社会主义的经济法则。”这一论点是完全不正确的。
    是不是在我们身外客观地存在着不以人们的意志和意识为转移的经济发展的规律性呢？马克思主义对这个问题的回答是肯定的。马克思主义认为，社会主义政治经济学的法则是存在于我们身外的客观规律性在人们头脑中的反映。但是萨宁娜和温什尔两同志的公式对这问题的回答是否定的。这就是说，这两位同志是站在不正确理论的观点上，这理论断定社会主义制度下经济发展的法则是由社会领导机关所“创造”、“改造”的。换句话说，他们脱离了马克思主义，走上了主观唯心论的道路。
    当然，人们能发现这些客观的规律性，认识它们，并且依靠它们，利用它们来为社会谋福利。但是人们既不能“创造”也不能“改造”它们。
    假定说，我们暂且采取不正确理论的观点，否认社会主义制度下的经济生活中有客观规律性的存在，并宣告可能“创造”经济法则，“改造”经济法则。结果会怎么样呢？这就会使我们陷身在混乱和偶然性的王国，使我们处在奴隶似地依赖于这些偶然性的地位，使我们不仅失去了解事情的可能性，而且简直会在这偶然性的混乱中瞎摸。
    这就会使我们取消政治经济学这门科学，因为不承认客观的规律性，不研究这些规律性，科学是不能存在和发展的。取消了科学，我们就没有可能预见国内经济生活中事变的进程，即没有可能把那怕是最起码的经济领导工作做好。
    归根到底，我们就会受那班决心“消灭”经济发展法则、不理解和不考虑客观规律性而来“创造”新法则的“经济”冒险主义者任意摆布。
    大家都知道恩格斯在他的“反杜林论”里所提供的马克思主义对这问题的经典说法：
    “社会的力量如同自然力一样，在我们没有认识它们和重视它们以前，发生着盲目的、强制的、破坏的作用。可是我们一经认识了它们，研究了它们的活动、方向和影响，那末，我们就能完全作主，使它们愈来愈多地服从我们的意志，并借助它们来达到我们的目的。这特别是指现代强大的生产力。在我们还执拗地拒绝了解生产力的本性和性质的时候——而资本主义的生产方式及其维护者是反对这种了解的，——生产力总是起违反我们、反对我们的作用，它总是支配着我们，正像在上面详细叙述过的那样。可是，当生产力的本性一被了解之后，它就会在联合起来了的生产者手中，由恶魔似的支配者变成顺从的奴仆。这里的差别，正像雷电中带破坏性的电力与电报机上和弧光灯中驯服的电力之间的差别一样，也正像火灾的火与供人使用的火之间的差别一样。当人们能按照现代生产力的终于被认识了的本性来处理它的时候，生产中的社会的无政府状态便会由生产中的社会的有计划调节来代替，这种生产是为了满足整个社会以及社会中每个成员的需要的。那时资本主义的占有方式，将由新的占有方式来代替。在资本主义占有方式中，产品开始是奴役生产者，以后又奴役占有者，而新的占有方式则是以现代生产资料的本性为根据的：一方面是社会直接占有作为维持和扩大生产的资料的产品，另一方面是个人直接占有作为生活和享乐的资料的产品。”
    二、关于把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制水平的办法问题
    为了把集体农庄所有制（这当然不是全民所有制）提高到全民的（“国民的”）所有制的水平，必须采取些什么办法呢？
    有些同志以为，应该依照从前处理资本主义财产的例子干脆把集体农庄财产收归国有，宣布它是全民的财产。这个建议是完全不正确的，是绝对不能采纳的。集体农庄的财产是社会主义的财产，所以我们无论如何不能像处理资本主义财产那样来处理它。无论如何不能因为集体农庄的财产不是全民的财产，就说集体农庄的财产不是社会主义的财产。
    这些同志以为，把个别人或个别集团的财产转归国家所有，是唯一的或无论如何是最好的国有化〔注〕形式。这是不对的。事实上，转归国家所有，这并不是唯一的、甚至也不是最好的国有化形式，而是原始的国有化形式，正如恩格斯在“反杜林论”里关于这点所正确说过的那样。当国家还存在的时候，转归国家所有，无疑地是最容易理解的原始的国有化形式。但国家并不是永世长存的。随着社会主义的活动范围在世界大多数国家中的扩大，国家将日渐消亡，因而把个别人的财产和个别集团的财产转归国家所有的问题当然也就会消失。国家一定消亡，而社会是一定留存下来的。因此，作为全民财产的承继人的，已经不是将要消亡的国家，而是以中央经济领导机构为代表的社会本身。
    那末，为了把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，应该采取什么办法呢？
    作为这样来提高集体农庄所有制的基本办法，萨宁娜和温什尔两同志提议：把集中在农业机器站的基本生产工具出售给集体农庄，归其所有，这样来解除国家对农业作基本投资的负担，并达到使集体农庄自己来担负维持和发展农业机器站的费用。他们说：
    “如果以为集体农庄的投资应该主要用在集体农村的文化需要上，而对于农业生产的需要，仍旧应该由国家进行基本的大批投资，那就不正确了。因为集体农庄已有充分能力把这一负担完全承当起来，而使国家解除这一负担，岂不是更加正确些吗？为了在国内制造出丰富的消费品，国家在自己的投资方面还有不少的事情要做。”
    为了论证这一建议，建议人提出了几个论据：
    第一，援引斯大林所说生产资料甚至不出售给集体农庄的这句话，建议人怀疑斯大林的这一论点，宣称国家毕竟在出售生产资料给集体农庄，如像大镰刀、小镰刀之类的小农具以及小发动机等等生产资料。他们认为，既然国家把这些生产资料出售给集体农庄，那末国家也可以把农业机器站的机器之类的一切其他生产资料出售给集体农庄。
    这一论据是不能成立的。当然，国家是把小农具出售给集体农庄的，依照农业劳动组合章程和宪法，这是可以的。但是可不可以把小农具和像农业机器站的机器那样的农业基本生产资料，或者，例如，像那也是农业基本生产资料之一的土地相提并论呢？显然，是不可以的。其所以不可以，是因为小农具丝毫也决定不了集体农庄生产的命运，可是像农业机器站的机器以及土地这样的生产资料，在我国当前的条件下，是完全可以决定农业的命运的。
    不难理解，当斯大林说生产资料不出售给集体农庄的时候，他所指的不是小农具，而是农业的基本生产资料，即农业机器站的机器、土地。建议人玩弄“生产资料”这字眼，把两种不同的东西混为一谈，他们不知不觉地碰了壁。
    第二，萨宁娜和温什尔两同志又引证说，在群众性的集体农庄运动开始的时期——一九二九年末和一九三○年初，联共（布）中央自己曾主张把农业机器站转归集体农庄所有，同时要求集体农庄在三年内偿清农业机器站的价值。他们认为，虽然这事情当时“因为”集体农庄“贫穷”而失败了，但是现在，当集体农庄已经富裕的时候，可以回头来采取把农业机器站出售给集体农庄的政策。
    这一论据也是不能成立的。在一九三○年初，联共（布）中央确实决定过把农业机器站出售给集体农庄。当时是按照一部分集体农庄突击队员的建议，作为试验、作为尝试而通过这个决定的，为的要在不久之后回到这个问题上来加以审查。但头一次检查就表明这一决定是不妥当的。过了几个月，即在一九三○年末，就把这个决定取消了。
    后来集体农庄运动进一步的增长和集体农庄建设的发展，使集体农庄庄员以及领导工作人员都最后地确信，把农业的基本生产工具集中在国家手中，集中在农业机器站手中，是保证集体农庄生产高速度增长的唯一方法。
    我们大家都庆幸我国农业生产的巨大增长，谷物、棉花、亚麻、糖萝卜等等生产的增长。这种增长的源泉是什么呢？这种增长的源泉就是现代技术，就是许许多多为这一切生产部门服务的现代化机器。这里的问题，不仅在于一般的技术，而是在于技术不能停止不前，它必须继续日新月异地改进，旧的技术必须作废，代之以新技术，新的再代之以最新的。不这样做，我国社会主义农业的突飞猛进就是不可思议的，无论丰富的收获，无论丰足的农产品，也都是不可思议的。但是，要把几十万架车轮式的拖拉机作废，代之以履带式的拖拉机，把几万架陈旧了的联合机作废，代之以新的联合机，以及例如，为技术作物制造新的机器，这是什么意思呢？这就是说，要负担几十亿的支出，这些支出非经过六年到八年之后不能完全收回。即使我国的集体农庄是百万富翁，它们负担得了这样大的支出吗？不，负担不了，因为它们没有力量负担要在六年至八年之后才能完全收回的几十亿的费用。这种支出只有国家才负担得了，因为国家，并且只有国家才负担得起用新机器去更换旧机器所受到的这种损失，因为国家，并且只有国家才承担得起因在六年到八年之后才能收回这笔费用而受到的这种损失。
    明白这一切之后，那末要求把农业机器站出售给集体农庄归其所有，是什么意思呢？这就是说，使集体农庄遭受巨大损失，使集体农庄破产，破坏农业的机械化，减低集体农庄生产的速度。
    由此可得出结论说，萨宁娜和温什尔两同志建议把农业机器站出售给集体农庄归其所有，就是向落后方面退后一步，就是企图把历史的车轮拉向后转。
    就暂且假定一下，我们接受了萨宁娜和温什尔两同志的建议，并着手把基本生产工具、农业机器站出售给集体农庄归其所有。这会得到什么结果呢？
    第一，结果就会是集体农庄成了基本生产工具的所有者，换句话说，它们就会处于我国无论那一个企业都没有的特殊地位，因为大家知道，在我国，甚至国有化的企业也并不是生产工具的所有者。究竟用什么理由来作为集体农庄的这种特殊地位的根据呢，用什么进步的、前进的理由来作为根据呢？可不可以说，这样的地位就会促使集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，就会加快我们的社会从社会主义过渡到共产主义呢？如果说这样的地位只会使集体农庄所有制离开全民所有制更远，不是使得接近共产主义，反而是使得远离共产主义，岂不是更正确些吗？
    第二，结果就会是扩大商品流通的活动范围，因为巨量的农业生产工具会投进商品流通的范围。商品流通范围的扩大能不能使得我们向共产主义推进呢？萨宁娜和温什尔两同志以为如何？说它只会阻滞我们向共产主义前进，岂不是更正确些吗？
    萨宁娜和温什尔两同志的基本错误，是在于他们不了解商品流通在社会主义制度下的作用和意义，不了解商品流通是和从社会主义过渡到共产主义的前途不相容的。大概他们以为，就是有商品流通，也可以从社会主义过渡到共产主义去，商品流通是不会妨碍这个事业的。这是由于不了解马克思主义而犯的严重错误。
    恩格斯在他的“反杜林论”里批评杜林主张的在商品流通条件下活动的“经济公社”时，确凿证明商品流通的存在必然要使杜林的所谓“经济公社”去复活资本主义。大概，萨宁娜和温什尔两同志是不同意这一点的。那末，他们就更站不住脚了。但是，我们马克思主义者是从这个著名的马克思主义原理出发：从社会主义过渡到共产主义以及依照需要来分配产品的共产主义原则，是摈斥任何商品交换的，因而也摈斥把产品转化为商品，同时也就是把产品转化为价值的。
    关于萨宁娜和温什尔两同志的建议和论据的情形，就是如此。
    为了把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，归根到底应该采取什么步骤呢？
    集体农庄不是普通的企业。集体农庄耕种的土地早已不是集体农庄的财产，而是全民的财产。因而，集体农庄并不是它所耕种的土地的所有者。
    其次，集体农庄借以进行工作的基本生产工具，并不是集体农庄的财产，而是全民的财产。因而，集体农庄不是基本生产工具的所有者。
    再次，集体农庄是合作企业，它使用自己庄员的劳动，按照劳动日把收入分配给庄员，而且集体农庄有自己年年更换的、用于生产的种籽。
    试问，集体农庄究竟占有一些什么，它可以随心所欲、完全自由支配的集体农庄财产是什么？这种财产就是集体农庄的产品、集体农庄生产的产品，即谷物、肉类、油类、蔬菜、棉花、糖萝卜、亚麻等等，而建筑物和集体农庄庄员园地中的个人副业不计在内。问题在于，这种产品的大部分、即集体农庄生产的剩余品，进入市场，从而列入商品流通系统中。正是这种情况现在阻碍着把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平。所以正应该从这一方面展开工作，来把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平。
    为了把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，必须将集体农庄生产的剩余品从商品流通系统中排除出去，把它们列入国家工业和集体农庄间的产品交换系统中。问题的实质就在这里。
    我们还没有发达的产品交换制度，但是有以“换货”为形式的农产品产品交换的萌芽。
    大家知道，对植棉、种麻、种糖萝卜和其他的集体农庄的产品早已实行“换货”了。诚然，这是不完全的、部分的“换货”，但总算是在“换货”了。要顺便指出：“换货”这个名词是不妥当的，应该用“产品交换”来代替它。任务是在于，要使农业的一切部门中都培植这些产品交换的萌芽，并把它们发展成为产品交换的广大系统，以便集体农庄在交出自己的产品时不仅取得货币，而主要是取得必要的制成品。这样的制度需要大量地增加城市送交农村的产品，所以，推行这种制度无需特别急忙，要随着城市制成品积累的程度而定。但是应该一往直前、毫不犹豫地推行这种制度，一步一步地缩小商品流通的活动范围，而扩大产品交换的活动范围。
    这样的制度既缩小着商品流通的活动范围，就使社会主义易于过渡到共产主义。此外，它使我们有可能把集体农庄的基本财产、集体农庄生产的产品包括进全民计划化的总的系统中。
    为了在我国现今条件下把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，这将是实际的和有决定意义的办法。
    这样的制度对于集体农庄的农民是否有利呢？无疑是有利的。其所以有利，是因为集体农庄农民从国家手中获得的产品，将比在商品流通中获得的要多得多，价钱也便宜得多。大家知道，与政府订有产品交换（“换货”）合同的集体农庄所获得的利益，较之没有订立这种合同的集体农庄，要多得无比。如果产品交换制度推广到全国所有的集体农庄，那末这些利益就要成为我国全体集体农庄农民都能享受的了。  约·斯大林  一九五二年九月二十八日
