Several Experiences in Party Building Work in Beijing
The Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
    According to the central government's instructions on Party building work, the Beijing Municipal Committee carried out the following tasks in July and August: (1) conveyed the central government's instructions on Party building work to all Party members and conducted relatively thorough ideological mobilization work; (2) each district committee and each industrial and mining enterprise Party committee formulated annual plans for developing the Party and specific plans for August and September; (3) selected and registered activists and began educational observation work; (4) identified a group of organizers and assigned specific tasks; (5) by the end of August, the city had admitted more than 2,500 new Party members. The Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee sent personnel to conduct key inspections of these new Party members. The results of the inspection proved that these new Party members met the eight conditions of the Party member standard.
    In the development of Party work in July and August, the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee gained the following experiences:
    First, to mobilize the entire Party to do a good job in developing the Party, it is first necessary to repeatedly and deeply convey the central government's instructions on Party building work, point out the necessity and possibility of developing the Party at present, point out that developing the Party is the task of the entire Party, and that any phenomenon of not caring about or underestimating the development of Party work is not allowed, so that every Party member clearly recognizes that developing the Party is an obligation that they should fulfill. At the same time, Party committees at all levels must specifically lead the development of Party work, put the development of Party work on the agenda, and take the lead in doing it. Facts have proven that only in this way can the development of Party work be done well. For example, the original Eighth District Committee attached importance to the development of Party work from the very beginning. At the district committee meeting, relatively thorough research and discussion were conducted on issues such as formulating plans for developing the Party, selecting activists and organizers, and mastering the Party member standards. At the same time, the district committee members made specific divisions of labor, which effectively promoted the development of Party work in the entire district and smoothly completed the task of receiving more than sixty new Party members in July and August. However, some Party committees do not attach importance to the development of Party work, or they attach importance to it in words but not in practice, pushing this work to the organization department, and even asking cadres of the organization department to do other work. In such units, not only can the task of developing the Party not be completed, but also the idea that some cadres and some Party members despise the development of the Party is further developed. For example, some people say: "Whichever task is emphasized, we will focus on that." "If the administrative task is not completed, we will be criticized, and the development of Party work can be postponed." Under the control of this idea, an individual branch has not started to do the development of Party work until the end of August.
    Second, the development of Party work must be carried out publicly. It is necessary to publicly publicize communism, the Communist Party, and the eight conditions of the Communist Party member standard, so that everyone not only knows that we want to develop the Party, but also knows how we develop the Party. After this, we can publicly call on activists to apply for Party membership and conduct education and observation of activists. Some people are afraid that doing so will make the development of Party work passive and are unwilling to adopt this method, but instead secretly talk about the "eight conditions" behind closed doors. Also, because they do not publicly publicize the issue of developing the Party to the masses, some activists do not know about the development of the Party. Some people think: "There must be a quota for Party members, and once it reaches five million, it will stop developing, right?" Therefore, they dare not apply for Party membership. These situations have seriously affected the development of Party work. In fact, all departments that publicly carry out publicity and publicly carry out the development of Party work have greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of activists to strive for Party membership. The encouragement to the general public is also very great, making everyone clearly recognize their direction of struggle. This shows that the development of Party work must be carried out publicly.
    Third, emphasize the combination of the development of Party work and the central task. Some people regard the development of Party work and the central task as completely opposed, thus abandoning or relaxing the development of Party work. This is because they have not recognized that the entire process of developing Party work can be combined with the central task. After non-Party activists are educated about communism, the Communist Party, and the eight conditions of the Communist Party member standard, their class consciousness can be rapidly improved, and their enthusiasm for production will also increase. This effectively promotes the central task. On the other hand, the Party also deeply examines the class consciousness and work performance of activists in these central tasks. The Party General Branch of the No. 5 Factory of the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing and Assembly Plant combined production with the development of Party work. After publicity and education, the production enthusiasm of non-Party activists in the factory was generally improved, and they expressed that they would strive for Party membership in production. In this way, the development of Party work promoted the production of the entire factory.
    Fourth, educating and observing non-Party activists is an important key in the development of Party work. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must pay sufficient attention to this work and list it as one of the Party's regular tasks. If the work of educating and observing activists is seen as just a temporary crash task before receiving new Party members, then not only will the development of Party work not be done well, but errors may also occur. At the same time, all Party members should be educated to recognize this point and pay attention to doing a good job in educating and observing activists.
    There should be unified regulations on the conditions for activists to prevent the biases of being too high or too low due to inconsistent conditions. After determining the conditions for activists, we can register activists and conduct systematic education and in-depth observation of them. In some departments with fewer Party members, Party organizations can directly or through organizations such as the Communist Youth League and trade unions, assign certain tasks to activists, and ask them to further play their active role in the work under the direct leadership of the Party, in order to examine their actual level of awareness. At the same time, Party organizations should provide activists with various specific assistance in order to overcome their shortcomings and errors in work and thought in a timely manner, and gradually raise them to the level of Party members.
    Fifth, educate the entire Party to correctly grasp the Party member standard. In the development of Party work in Beijing in July and August, there was a relatively widespread phenomenon of demanding too much in grasping the Party member standard, emphasizing that activists must have "miracles," and saying that those who work hard in their work have "little political effect" and are not admitted to the Party. Some deliberately raise minor aspects of life to the height of principle, arbitrarily label people, and seize on shortcomings that others have already overcome; some require workers to comprehensively and systematically understand communism; some, upon hearing an activist say that "the interests of the Party also include personal interests," believe that this activist has "individualism" and is not qualified; some believe that some activists have not experienced life-and-death tests in a peaceful environment and are not reliable, and wait and see. This has caused confusion in the thinking of activists, who do not know how to be qualified or how to look like a Party member. In general, some activists feel that the eight conditions of the Communist Party member standard are unattainable and dare not apply for Party membership. This has affected the development of Party work. Therefore, Party committees must proactively and systematically organize cadres of Party grassroots organizations to learn how to correctly grasp the Party member standard through analyzing specific objects at the beginning of the development of Party work. At the same time, we must always check and collect actual examples of being too high or too low in grasping the Party member standard and educate the entire Party. We must make it clear to everyone that the eight conditions of the Communist Party member standard are the conditions for joining the Party now, and also the direction of future hard work, explaining that those who generally understand the eight conditions, recognize the eight conditions, and strive in practical actions according to the eight conditions can join the Party.
    Sixth, select a group of capable organizers and strictly control the development of Party work. According to the specific tasks of developing the Party, Beijing selected 558 people with a correct work style, loyal to the Party, and with a certain ability to develop the Party to be municipal committee organizers, most of whom are Party committee secretaries, Party committee members, general branch secretaries, general branch members, and responsible Party member cadres of mass organizations, organs, industrial and mining enterprises departments. The task of the organizers is to: talk to the objects of development, examine whether they have the conditions for joining the Party, and responsibly put forward opinions on how to handle them. When talking to the objects of development, the organizers must prepare in advance, such as understanding the basic situation of the objects of development, and determining the central content of the conversation according to different objects, but the main thing is to examine whether the objects of development have the conditions for joining the Party.

    北京市建党工作的几点经验
    中共北京市委组织部
    根据中央关于建党工作的指示，北京市委在七、八两月份作了以下几件工作：（一）向全体党员传达了中央关于建党工作的指示，并进行了比较充分的思想动员工作；（二）各区委和各工矿党委都制订了全年发展党的计划和八、九月份的具体计划；（三）对积极分子进行了选择和登记工作，并开始了教育考察工作；（四）确定了一批组织员，并具体分配了任务；（五）到八月底，全市已接收了二千五百多名新党员。对于这批新党员，北京市委组织部曾派人进行了重点检查。检查结果，证明这些新党员都符合党员标准的八项条件。
    在七、八两月的发展党的工作中，北京市委组织部取得了以下几点体验：
    第一，要动员全党作好发展党的工作，首先要反复地深入地传达中央关于建党工作的指示，指出目前发展党的必要和可能，指出发展党是全党的任务，一切不关心或轻视发展党的工作的现象是不容许的，使每个党员明确地认识发展党是自己应尽的义务。同时各级党委必须具体领导发展党的工作，把发展党的工作放在议事日程上，以身作则，带头去作。事实证明，只有这样，才能把发展党的工作作好。如原八区区委一开始就重视发展党的工作，在区委会上，对制订发展党的计划、选择积极分子和组织员的工作以及掌握党员标准等问题，都曾作了比较充分的研究和讨论。同时区委委员又作了具体分工，因而有力地推动了全区的发展党的工作，顺利地完成了七、八月份接收六十多个新党员的任务。但是有些党委对发展党的工作是不重视的，或者口头上重视，实际上不重视，把这项工作推给组织部门去管，甚至还要组织部门的干部作其他工作。在这样的单位，不仅不能完成发展党的任务，而且使某些干部和某些党员轻视发展党的思想更加发展。例如有人说：“那一头抓得紧，就干那一头。”“行政任务完不成要受批评，发展党的工作可以往后拖。”在这种思想支配下，有个别支部直至八月底还没有动手作发展党的工作。
    第二，必须公开进行发展党的工作。要公开宣传共产主义、共产党和共产党员标准的八项条件，要使大家不仅知道我们要发展党，而且知道我们怎样发展党。在这之后，即可公开号召积极分子申请入党，并对积极分子进行教育和考察。有人怕这样作会使发展党的工作陷于被动，不愿采用这种方式，而是偷偷摸摸地关门讲“八条”。又因为不向群众公开宣传发展党的问题，所以有些积极分子就不知道发展党这回事。有的人则想：“党员有定额吧，到了五百万就不发展了吧？”因而不敢申请入党。这些情形都严重地影响了发展党的工作。事实上，凡是公开进行宣传，公开进行发展党的工作的部门，就大大地鼓舞了积极分子争取入党的情绪。对一般群众的鼓舞也很大，使大家明确认识了自己的奋斗方向。这就说明，发展党的工作是必须公开进行的。
    第三，强调发展党的工作和中心工作相结合。有些人把发展党的工作和中心工作看成是完全对立的，因而放弃或放松了发展党的工作。这是因为他们没有认识发展党的工作的整个过程，都是可以和中心工作相结合进行的。非党积极分子经过关于共产主义和共产党以及共产党员标准的八项条件的教育后，阶级觉悟就能迅速地提高，而生产积极性也随之提高。这就有力地推动了中心工作。另一方面，党也就在这些中心工作中，深入地考察了积极分子的阶级觉悟和工作表现。北京市汽车制配厂第五厂党总支，就是结合生产进行发展党的工作的。该厂经过宣传教育后，非党积极分子的生产积极性普遍提高，纷纷表示要在生产中争取入党。这样发展党的工作就推动了全厂的生产。
    第四，教育和考察非党积极分子是发展党的工作中的重要关键。因此各级党委对这一工作必须予以足够的重视，列为党的经常工作之一。如果把教育和考察积极分子的工作看成只是接收新党员之前的一种临时突击工作，那末，发展党的工作不仅不能作好，还可能发生错误。同时应该教育全体党员都认识到这一点，都注意作好教育和考察积极分子的工作。
    关于积极分子的条件，应有统一的规定，以防止条件不一致而发生过高过低的偏向。在确定积极分子的条件以后，即可登记积极分子，并对他们进行系统的教育和深入的考察工作。有些党员少的部门，党的组织可以直接或通过青年团、工会等组织，给积极分子分配一定的任务，要他们在党的直接领导下，更加发挥其在工作中的积极作用，借以考察他们的实际觉悟程度。与此同时，党的组织要给积极分子以各种具体帮助，以便及时克服他们在工作上、思想上的缺点和错误，逐渐把他们提高到党员的水平。
    第五，教育全党正确地掌握党员标准。北京市在七、八月份发展党的工作中，在掌握党员标准上，比较普遍地存在要求过高的现象，强调积极分子必须是“有奇迹”，而把在工作上埋头苦干的人说成是“政治作用不大”的，不吸收入党。有的就有意地把生活小节提到原则高度，乱扣帽子，而抓住别人已经克服了的缺点不放；有的要求工人全面地系统地了解共产主义；有的听到积极分子说“党的利益也包含个人利益”，就认为这个积极分子有“个人主义”，不够条件；有的认为某些积极分子在和平环境中没有经过生死考验，不保险，再等待等待。这样就使积极分子思想发生混乱现象，不知道怎样才够条件，怎样才能像个党员的样子。总的说，有些积极分子感到共产党员标准的八项条件可望而不可及，不敢申请入党。这就影响了发展党的工作。因此，党委必须在发展党的工作一开始就主动地有计划地组织党的基层组织的干部通过对具体对象的分析，学会正确地掌握党员标准。同时要随时检查和搜集在掌握党员标准上的过高或过低的实际例证，向全党进行教育。要向大家讲清，共产党员标准的八项条件是现在入党的条件，也是今后努力奋斗的方向，说明一般地懂得八项条件、承认八项条件，并且在实际行动中按照八项条件而努力的人，才可以入党。
    第六，选拔一批得力的组织员，严格控制发展党的工作。北京市根据发展党的具体任务，选拔了五百五十八个作风正派、对党忠诚、有一定的发展党的能力的人当市委组织员，其中绝大多数是党委书记、党委委员、总支书记、总支委员以及群众团体、机关、工矿、企业部门负责的党员干部。组织员的任务是：和发展对象进行谈话，考察其是否已具备入党条件，并负责地提出处理意见。在和发展对象进行谈话时，组织员必须事先作好准备工作，如了解发展对象的基本情况，根据不同对象确定谈话中心内容，但主要的是考察发展对象是否具备入党条件。
