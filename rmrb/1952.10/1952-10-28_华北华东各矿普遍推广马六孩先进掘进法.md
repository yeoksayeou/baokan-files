    The advanced experience in coal mine tunneling – the Ma Liu-hai multi-drift cyclic tunneling method – has been widely promoted in mines in North and East China, achieving remarkable results. According to statistics from eight mining bureaus, including Datong, Shandong, Jingxi, Yangquan, Jiaozuo, and Jingxing: among 145 tunneling teams, 112 teams have adopted the advanced tunneling experience of the Ma Liu-hai team. All tunneling teams in Datong and Jingxi mines have fully adopted the two-drift semi-cyclic operation. The average monthly progress of each tunneling team in various mines has increased by 22% to 167% compared to before the promotion. This has initially solved the long-standing problem in coal mine production where tunneling work could not keep up with coal mining needs. Especially after the widespread promotion of deep-hole operations, bottom-hole cavity blasting, and air-gap blasting methods in July of this year, the tunneling efficiency of each round of blasting has been greatly improved. In the past, ordinary tunneling teams could only advance about one meter per round of blasting, but now many teams have reached 1.8 meters to 2 meters, with the highest reaching 2.8 meters. Due to the increased tunneling efficiency, production costs have decreased accordingly. For example, the cost per meter of advance for the Yongqiang First Tunneling Team of Shandong Taozhuang Coal Mine in September was reduced by 30% compared to August.
    While promoting advanced tunneling experience, various mines have also paid attention to the safe production of workers in each tunneling team. Wang Fuyou, a technician from Shandong Hongshan Coal Mine, and Luan Xuexian, a mechanical and electrical worker from Xihe Coal Mine, have both created coal dust removers, which can eliminate more than 80% of coal dust, making a significant contribution to the labor protection of tunneling workers.
    In order to further consolidate and develop the Ma Liu-hai tunneling method and adapt to the increased tunneling efficiency, various mines have made new developments in improving transportation conditions and achieving transportation mechanization. In particular, the Ma Liu-hai tunneling team of Datong Coal Mine has tested the use of loading machines on the tunneling face, laid double tracks in the roadways, and installed mobile turntables and lightweight winches. This has greatly improved transportation efficiency and gradually achieved a balanced development between various processes of tunneling work. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华北华东各矿普遍推广马六孩先进掘进法
    煤矿掘进工作的先进经验——马六孩多孔道循环掘进工作法，已在华北、华东各矿普遍推广，取得显著成绩。据大同、山东、京西、阳泉、焦作、井陉等八个矿务局的统计：在一百四十五个掘进组中，已有一百十二个组推广了马六孩小组的先进掘进经验。大同、京西两矿的所有掘进组已全部采用了两孔道半循环作业。各矿每个掘进组的平均月进度，已比推广前提高了百分之二十二到百分之一百六十七。这就使煤矿生产中长期存在的掘进工作赶不上采煤需要的问题获得初步解决。特别是今年七月各矿普遍推广了深孔作业和眼底空心爆破、空眼爆破等先进爆破方法以后，每一遍炮的掘进效率已大大提高。过去一般掘进组每遍炮只能进一公尺左右，现在不少组已达到一点八公尺到两公尺，最高已达到二点八公尺。由于掘进效率提高，生产成本就随着降低。如山东陶庄煤矿永强第一掘进队每进一公尺的成本，九月份就比八月份减低了百分之三十。
    各矿在推广先进的掘进经验的同时，也已注意到各掘进组工人的安全生产。山东洪山煤矿技术员王福友和西河煤矿机电工人栾学贤都创造了煤岩粉的除粉器，可以消除煤岩粉百分之八十以上，对掘进工人的劳动保护有重大的贡献。
    为了进一步巩固和发展马六孩掘进法，适应提高了的掘进效率，各矿在改善运搬条件、实现运搬机械化方面已有了新的发展。特别是大同煤矿马六孩掘进组，在掘进工作面上试用了装车机，在巷道里铺设了双轨，安置了活动转盘和轻便绞车。这就大大提高了运搬效率，逐步地达到了掘进工作各个工序间的平衡发展。（新华社）
