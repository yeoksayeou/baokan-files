    Reader's Letter

    Editor: In order to make the broad masses of people universally aware of the brilliant achievements of the new China in the three years since its founding, our street propaganda team has given reports to the residents of various locations. I personally participated in five large and small report meetings, with a total of more than 400 residents attending, accounting for 70% of all households. The feedback after the meetings was generally very good. Through such publicity, the residents further recognized the greatness of the motherland and increased their love for the motherland.

    This made me think about the publicity for the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference. Hundreds of representatives from 37 countries attended this conference. They represent different social strata, different political beliefs, and different religious beliefs, etc., but they hold the same purpose—to defend peace—to discuss the issue of defending peace in the Asian and Pacific region. This is welcomed and supported by peace-loving people all over the world. Therefore, our propagandists should do everything possible to widely publicize the significance of this conference to the masses in various ways, so that everyone knows it, so that the broad masses of people can better participate in the movement to defend peace and strive for lasting peace in the world.

    宣传员应广泛宣传和平会议的意义
    编辑同志：为了使广大人民普遍地知道新中国开国三年来的辉煌成就，我们街道宣传队曾经分别向各驻地居民作了有关的报告。仅我直接参加的即有五个大小不同的报告会，到会的居民共有四百多人，占全部住户的百分之七十。会后反映一般都很好。通过这样的宣传，使居民更进一步认识了祖国的伟大，增加了对祖国的热爱。
    由此我想到对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的宣传问题。参加这个会议的有三十七个国家的代表数百人，他们代表着不同的社会阶层、不同的政治信仰、不同的宗教信仰等等，但他们却抱着同一个目的——保卫和平，来商讨关于保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平问题。这是全世界爱好和平的人们所欢迎和拥护的。因此，我们宣传员应该尽一切力量，用各种方式把这个会议的意义向群众做广泛宣传，使得家喻户晓，从而使广大人民更好地参加保卫和平的运动，为争取全世界的持久和平而斗争。
    北京前门区薛家湾派出所街道宣传队宣传员  刘步唐
