    Fengfeng Coal Mine Achieves Good Results in Cleaning Up the Warehouse
    Editor: In the patriotic production increase and economizing movement, the leadership of Fengfeng Coal Mine paid great attention to handling the equipment that had been stockpiled in the warehouse for a long time, solving many problems. In July, the mine established an organization to handle stockpiled equipment and organized key personnel (including technical personnel) from the various factories and mines' material departments to visit the general warehouse of the mining bureau, enabling everyone to understand the actual situation of the stored equipment. As a result, many pieces of equipment that had been stockpiled for several years and could not be found in the past were discovered. For example, when the Mechanical and Electrical Department needed a five-horsepower motor in the past, the warehouse said there were none, and two new ones were purchased from other places, but this time it was discovered that there were three in stock. In the past, when the repair shop needed flanges, the warehouse also said there were none, causing the repair shop to stop work and wait for materials. This time, it was discovered that there were many flanges stored in the scrap warehouse. Comrades from the power plant visited the scrap warehouse and found that the electric meters in the scrap were not only usable but also of better quality than the new ones.
    In order to quickly and rationally handle this large batch of stockpiled equipment, everyone came up with many effective methods. Comrades in the warehouse created a detailed list of stockpiled equipment and distributed it to the material departments of various factories and mines for reference. When each material requisitioning unit requisitioned materials, they first issued a promissory note and took them out, and then completed the formal procedures when they could be used, etc. At present, all units of Fengfeng Coal Mine are actively making budget contracts and trying their best to use existing equipment first. The Second Mine has already included the utilization of 54 kinds of stockpiled equipment in the material contract for the fourth quarter.

    峰峰煤矿清理仓库成绩良好
    编辑同志：在爱国增产节约运动中，峰峰煤矿领导方面十分重视地处理了长期积压在仓库里的器材，解决了很多问题。七月份，该矿成立了处理积压器材的机构，并组织了各厂矿用料部门主要人员（包括技术人员）到矿务局总仓库进行参观，使大家了解了库存器材的实际情况。结果积压好几年的和过去找不到的许多器材都被发现了。如机电处过去需用五马力电动机时，仓库说没有，另从外地采购了二部新的，但这次发现库存有三个。过去，修理厂领法蓝盘时，库里也说没有，以致修理厂停工待料，这次发现废品库里存了很多法蓝盘。电厂同志参观废品库，发现废品里的电表不但能用，而且质量比新的还好。
    为了迅速地合理地处理这一大批积压器材，大家想出了好多有效的办法。仓库的同志制造了积压器材明细表，发给各厂矿用料部门作为参考。各领料单位在领料时，先打借条领出，能用时再办正式手续等。目前峰峰煤矿各单位正积极作预算合同，想尽先使用旧有器材。第二矿已经把利用五十四种库存器材列入第四季用料合同中。
