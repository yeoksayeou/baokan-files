The Party-Building Experience of the Original Eight District Party Committees of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC
Zhang Tong

The Party Committees of the Original Eight Districts of Beijing (now merged with part of the Original Ninth District to form Xuanwu District) implemented the instructions of the Party Central Committee on party-building work and developed 62 new party members in July and August in a planned and prepared manner under leadership.

Fully prepare ideologically and organizationally

In early June, the Eight District Party Committee saw the Central Committee's instructions on party building and focused on studying the situation of the party organizations in the entire district, and deliberated on the preparatory work for party building. The proportion of party members in the district's government offices, schools, and factories was very small. Among the more than 100 local state-owned and private factories of all sizes in the district, a large proportion had not yet established party organizations. Even in factories where party organizations had been established, there were very few party members in the main power departments and among the technical workers. Under these circumstances, it would not be possible to build the party by relying solely on the organization department of the district committee; it was necessary to mobilize all party members to do it.

After the Beijing Municipal Committee assigned the task of party building, the Eight District Party Committee immediately conveyed it to all party members, requiring each branch to quickly formulate a party-building work plan and mobilize party members to discuss party-building work.

The discussions in various branches and groups reflected that many branches and party members still had many erroneous ideas about party-building work: One was to underestimate party-building work. A section chief (branch committee member) of the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau confessed: "In the past, I thought it would be impossible to fail to complete administrative tasks, but party-building work could be delayed." Party members of the Cement Tile Factory asked the branch secretary when the party would be built. The branch secretary said: "Where is there time to do this!" The party member then asked: "The whole country is carrying out party-building work, and the district committee has also made arrangements. What should we do?" The branch secretary replied: "The district committee is only doing this, we still have to do administrative work." Some party members also regarded party building as "the business of the branch committee members." The second situation was that some party members had a closed-door mentality. The director of the Jiaotong Cotton Mill said: "Our factory should have developed new party members long ago, but when I think of the standards for Communist Party members, I feel that this person is not qualified and that person is not qualified." Some branch committee members believe that those who now request to join the party have not undergone any "tests" or "training." Some even think that those who now request to join the party are "somewhat opportunistic"... In response to these ideological situations, the organization department of the district committee held various meetings (general membership meetings, joint meetings of branch secretaries, etc.), repeatedly explaining the importance and possibility of party building; party building is the task of the entire party, and every party member has the obligation to do party work, and sternly criticized the erroneous idea of underestimating party-building work. Later, all the groups launched discussions and put forward future practices. Xue Fei (party member), director of the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, voluntarily attended the branch committee meeting to discuss party-building work. At the meeting, he took the lead in recommending an activist to the branch. Other branch committee members reviewed their past thoughts of not attaching importance to party-building work. Some branches also held symposiums for activists to understand the ideological situation of the activists and listen to the activists' opinions on the branch. This enabled the branch committee members and party members to more deeply understand the necessity and possibility of party building, and the idea of underestimating party-building work was gradually eliminated.

At the same time, the organization department of the district committee conducted investigations into the activists. In addition to sending cadres to investigate, it also held symposiums for various types of activists (cadres of the Communist Youth League and grass-roots trade unions, workers, government employees, etc.). Through these symposiums, the organization department of the district committee generally learned that most of the activists had a relatively correct understanding of the party, eagerly requested to join the party, and were now active in work and production. Although some of them were not politically aware enough, they could reach the standards of party members after education and training. Others did not understand the nature of the party, believing that "the Communist Party is a peasant party," and some were unclear about the consistency of personal interests and the interests of the party, believing that party members "have no personal interests at all." Education should be strengthened for these people to raise their class consciousness.

After each branch formulated a party-building plan, the district committee held a meeting to discuss and formulate a district-wide party-building plan, and made the following decision: Party member cadres of the trade union office and the district committee of the Communist Youth League should be responsible for doing a good job in the party-building work of factories that do not yet have party organizations. The meeting also specifically discussed the work of the organizers. Everyone launched a discussion on the task of the organizers. Some believed that: "The purpose of the organizer's conversation is to conduct an education for the development target." Some believed that: "The purpose of the organizer's conversation is only to examine whether the development target meets the eight conditions for party member standards." Others thought that: "The conversation is just a formality." Finally, everyone unified their understanding: the task of the organizer is not only to examine whether the development target meets the party member standards, but also to conduct an effective education based on the individual's specific situation. Finally, the organizer's conversation tasks were assigned, and a specific schedule for the conversation was arranged.

Selecting, educating, and cultivating activists

After the district committee's party-building plan was approved by the municipal committee, the organization department of the district committee carefully studied the selection of activists by each branch. At this time, the organization department of the district committee found that the party branch of the private Dahua Pottery Company underestimated the degree of consciousness of the masses and demanded too much of the activists. The company had more than 200 employees, including 50 members of the Communist Youth League and 60 to 70 trade union and Youth League cadres, but the branch initially only proposed nine activists. This was because some party members, and even individual branch responsible cadres, believed that only people without shortcomings could be activists; otherwise, it would affect the prestige of the party. At that time, this idea was quite common in the entire district, so the organization department of the district committee held various meetings and used various examples to repeatedly explain that there were now conditions to widely and extensively select activists. Therefore, it was necessary to boldly carry out selection based on the conditions for activists stipulated by the Beijing Municipal Committee; otherwise, it would be divorced from the masses and would affect the progress of party-building work. At the same time, it was explained that one should not use party member standards to select activists. After the activists were selected, they should be cultivated and educated to raise them to the level of party members. The organization department of the district committee also pointed out to each branch: arrange all activists in order, dividing them into development targets, cultivation targets, etc. At this time, the organization department of the district committee also sent people to provide specific assistance. The understanding of the party organizations and party members in the entire district gradually became clear, the scope of activist selection expanded, and the number of activists also increased. The Dahua Pottery Company increased from nine activists to thirty-two.

Next was the issue of strengthening the education and cultivation of activists. The district committee specially organized an amateur training class for activists, systematically educating those who could be used as development targets on party member standards. A total of 77 people participated in the study, and 120 people audited. The study lasted a total of seven days. The training class explained the eight conditions for Communist Party member standards in three times, and the students launched discussions based on the content of the explanations and combined with actual thoughts. Especially when studying the third, fourth, and fifth conditions of the Communist Party member standards, many people launched fierce ideological struggles on the issue of unconditionally subordinating personal interests to the interests of the party and striving for the cause of communism for life. As a result, correct thinking prevailed and class consciousness was raised. Wang Qingyuan, an employee of the Sanyang Flour Mill, participated in the "Anti-Three Evils" movement as a member of the "tiger fighting" team. Because the work was very tense, he was so tired that he vomited blood twice. When discussing unconditionally subordinating personal interests to the interests of the party, he thought: if I join the party, I have to play an exemplary role in everything, will I have to vomit blood again? He thought about it again and again, and felt that it was difficult to advance or retreat. Finally, he thought of the 25,000-mile Long March, when the Red Army crossed snow-capped mountains and grasslands, eating little and drinking less, with endless difficulties, but nothing prevented the Red Army's determination to move forward. Wang Qingyuan figured it out and resolutely requested to join the party, willing to strive for the cause of communism to the end!

After the education of the amateur training class for activists, the activists had a more systematic understanding of communism and the Communist Party, and had a correct understanding of their own shortcomings or mistakes. Most of them had made up their minds to strive for the cause of communism. Among the 77 trained activists, more than 60 formally applied to join the party.

Correctly grasp party member standards and recruit new party members

Correctly grasping the eight conditions for Communist Party member standards is an important issue in party building. This, in addition to the branch's usual education and review of activists, depends on the organizer's assessment. At the beginning, the organizers of the Eight Districts had no experience in how to correctly grasp the party member standards, especially the organizers who had never done party work felt even more helpless. The district committee paid attention to the leadership of the organizers, mainly helping the organizers solve the problem of how to correctly grasp the party member standards. When the organizers conducted conversations, the organization department of the district committee often sent people to listen in, understand the content of the conversations, and discover problems. More importantly, it selected typical figures for specific analysis to improve everyone's ability to grasp the party member standards. The organization department of the district committee had selected various types of development targets and held meetings for organizers to discuss them. There were different opinions at the beginning of the discussion, and only later did they reach a consensus. For example:

Gao Yizhi of the Fourth Branch of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau came from a student background, had a clear history, and worked diligently. When he first entered the city, he managed food in the general affairs section. Before the "Anti-Three Evils" movement, he was transferred to personnel work. He achieved results in his work, worked hard, studied hard, and is now a member of the Communist Youth League branch committee; he applied to join the party in 1950 and now wants to join the party again. However, he does not have great work courage, and has not achieved outstanding results in his work, and is not very dare to criticize people. During the discussion, some people believed that Gao Yizhi did not have outstanding achievements in his work, "could not play a vanguard role," and could be developed or not. In the end, everyone affirmed that: From all aspects of Gao Yizhi, he basically meets the eight conditions of a Communist Party member standard and can be developed into the party.

Liu Yong is a porter in the newly built Flour Mill. Before the "Anti-Three Evils" movement, he was active in production, but his relationship with the masses was not very good; he did not clearly understand the exploitation and oppression he had suffered in the past. He said: "I won't do it if I'm angry." The "Anti-Three Evils" movement gave him a great education. During the "Anti-Three Evils" movement, he actively participated in the "tiger fighting" team and worked very actively. His attitude towards the masses also improved. After talking with him, he also recognized the oppression he suffered in the old society. He also had a correct understanding of the Communist Party and communism. However, some people believe that: Liu Yong has not made progress for a long time and advocate not admitting him to the party. After discussion, everyone agreed that Liu Yong had a good composition, a clear history, and the "Anti-Three Evils" movement raised his class consciousness, was active in production and work, corrected his past shortcomings, and basically met the party member standards. He should be regarded as a development target.

This discussion meeting was equivalent to everyone doing a field exercise in grasping the standards. In particular, the discussion on Gao Yizhi made everyone clearly recognize that one should not have excessive demands on new party members, such as demanding "miracles," which is incorrect. One should see whether this person has met the party member standards. If he has met the party member standards, he should be admitted to the party. The discussion on Liu Yong's issue made everyone clearly realize that one should look at people from a developmental point of view. Through this meeting, the organizers had a further understanding of the issue of grasping the standards, and everyone felt that they had a bottom line in their hearts when talking to the development targets again.

In order to enable the entire party to accurately grasp the party member standards and recruit new party members, the organization department of the district committee specially held a joint meeting of branch secretaries, re-presented the several development targets discussed by the organizers for everyone to discuss. After the discussion, the conclusions of the organizers' discussion were conveyed to everyone, which played a demonstrative role in enabling each branch to grasp the party member standards.

In July and August, the original Eight Districts had 77 development targets. After the organizers talked with them, they found that 7 of them were not yet highly conscious, and there were still some problems with the history of 2 of them that needed further investigation.

The basic method for organizers in the Eight Districts to grasp the party member standards is to conduct specific analysis of specific objects. Before talking to the development targets, they first made full preparations: reading materials, contacting the branch, understanding the development targets' usual performance, and studying their key problems. When talking with them, they should see whether the development target understands the eight conditions for party member standards, acknowledges the eight conditions for party member standards, and is willing to make practical efforts for the eight conditions for party member standards.

After the organizer believes that they can be developed, they will return the applicant to the branch general meeting for discussion and approval.

    中共北京市原八区区委的建党经验
    张同
    中共北京市原八区（现已和原九区一部分合并为宣武区）区委贯彻执行了党中央关于建党工作的指示，在七八月份，有领导有计划有准备地发展了六十二名新党员。
    充分做好思想上和组织上的准备工作
    六月初，八区区委看到了中央关于建党的指示，就着重研究全区党组织的情况，酝酿建党准备工作。全区机关、学校、工厂的党员比例都很少，全区一百多个地方国营和私营大小工厂中，有一大部分还没有建立党的组织。就是已经建立了党组织的工厂，在主要的动力部门和技术工人中党员也很少。在此种情况下，光靠区委组织部门去建党是不成的，必须动员全体党员去做。
    北京市委布置建党任务以后，八区区委马上向全体党员传达，要求各支部很快订出建党工作计划，并发动党员讨论建党工作。
    从各支部、各小组的讨论中，反映出不少支部和党员对建党工作还有很多错误思想：一种是轻视建党工作。公安局外四分局的一个科长（支部委员）曾检讨说：“以前认为行政任务完不成不行，但建党工作可以拖一拖。”洋灰瓦厂党员问支部书记什么时候建党。支部书记说：“哪有时间搞这个！”党员又问：“全国都要进行建党工作，区委也已经布置，咱们应该怎么做？”支部书记回答：“区委是光搞这个的，我们还要搞行政工作。”也有一部分党员把建党看作是“支部委员的事”。第二种情况是某些党员中存在着关门主义情绪。交通制棉厂的厂长说：“我们厂子早就应该发展新党员了，可是一想到共产党员标准，就觉得这个人不够条件，那个人也不够条件。”有的支部委员认为现在要求入党的人，都没有经过什么“考验”和“锻炼”。甚至还有人认为现在要求入党的人“多少有点投机”……区委组织部针对这些思想情况，召开了各种会议
    （党员大会、支部书记联席会等），反复地说明建党的重要与可能；建党是全党的任务，每个党员都有作党的工作的义务，并严正地批判了轻视建党工作的错误思想。后来，各小组都展开了讨论，提出了今后的作法。公安局外四分局局长薛飞（党员）自动列席讨论建党工作的支委会会议。会上他以身作则地向支部推荐了一个积极分子。其他支委检查了过去不重视建党工作的思想。有的支部还召开了积极分子座谈会，了解积极分子的思想情况，倾听积极分子对支部的意见。这样使支部委员和党员更深刻地体会到建党的必要性与可能性，轻视建党工作的思想逐渐扫除了。
    同时，区委组织部对积极分子进行了了解工作，除了派干部下去了解外，还分别召开了各种类型（青年团和基层工会干部、工人、机关工作人员等）的积极分子座谈会。区委组织部通过这些座谈会，一般地了解到：大部分积极分子都对党有了比较正确的认识，迫切要求入党，现在工作、生产都积极，虽然其中有些人的政治觉悟不够高，但经过教育、培养，是可以达到党员标准的。另有少数人对党的性质还不了解，认为“共产党是农民党”，也有的对个人利益与党的利益的一致性认识不清，认为党员“根本没有个人利益”。对这些人更应该加强教育，提高他们的阶级觉悟。
    在各支部订出建党计划后，区委就开会讨论，制订了全区建党计划，并作了这样的决定：工会办事处、青年团区工委的党员干部要负责作好还没有党组织的工厂的建党工作。会上又具体地讨论了组织员的工作。大家对组织员的任务问题展开了讨论。有的认为：“组织员谈话，是为了对发展对象进行一次教育。”有的认为：“组织员谈话的目的只是审查发展对象是否够党员标准的八项条件。”也有的人认为：“谈话是个手续。”最后大家统一了认识：组织员的任务既要审查发展对象是否够党员标准，也要根据本人的具体情况进行一次有效的教育。最后分配了组织员的谈话任务，并具体安排了谈话日程。
    选拔、教育和培养积极分子
    区委建党计划经市委批准之后，区委组织部仔细地研究各支部选拔积极分子的情况。这时区委组织部门发现私营大华窑业公司党支部对群众的觉悟程度估计不足，对积极分子的要求过高。全公司有职工二百多人，其中有青年团员五十人，工会和团的干部六七十人，但支部开始只提出九个积极分子。这是因为有些党员甚至个别支部负责干部，认为没有缺点的人才能作积极分子，否则要影响党的威信。当时这种思想在全区是相当普遍的，因此区委组织部召开各种会议，用各种实例反复地说明现在有条件广泛地大量地选拔积极分子，因此必须根据北京市委所规定的积极分子条件，大胆地进行选拔，否则就会脱离群众，就会影响建党工作的进行。同时说明不能用党员标准去选拔积极分子的理由。在积极分子选拔出来以后，就要进行培养和教育，把他们提高到党员的水平。区委组织部又向各支部指出：把全部积极分子进行排队，分为发展对象，培养对象等几类。这时，区委组织部还派人下去作了具体帮助。全区党组织和党员的认识逐渐明确起来，积极分子选拔的范围扩大了，积极分子的数目也增多了。大华窑业公司就由九个积极分子增加到三十二个。
    接着就是加强对积极分子的教育和培养的问题。区委专门办了一个积极分子业余训练班，对可作发展对象的系统地进行了党员标准教育。参加学习的共有七十七人，旁听的有一百二十人。学习时间共七天。训练班把共产党员标准的八项条件分作三次讲解，学员根据讲解的内容，联系实际思想展开讨论。特别是学习到共产党员标准的八项条件的第三、四、五条时，不少人在个人利益无条件服从党的利益和终身为共产主义事业奋斗的问题上，展开了激烈的思想斗争。结果，正确思想占了上风，阶级觉悟提高了。三阳面粉厂职员王庆元在“五反”运动中参加“打虎”队，因为工作十分紧张，累得吐了两次血。讨论到个人利益无条件服从党的利益时，他想：入了党事事都要起模范作用，是不是还要累得吐血呢？他左思右想，觉得进退两难，最后他想到二万五千里长征时，红军过雪山、草地，少吃短喝，说不尽的困难，都没有阻止红军前进的决心。王庆元想通了，坚决要求入党，愿为共产主义事业奋斗到底！
    经过积极分子业余训练班的教育，积极分子对共产主义和共产党有了较有系统的了解，对自己的缺点或错误也有了正确的认识，其中大部分人已下定了为共产主义事业奋斗的决心。在七十七名受训的积极分子中，有六十多人正式申请了入党。
    正确掌握党员标准接收新党员
    正确地掌握共产党员标准的八项条件是建党中的一个重要问题。这除了支部平时对积极分子的教育和审查外，就决定于组织员的考察。开始八区的组织员对如何正确地掌握党员标准没有经验，特别是没有作过党的工作的组织员更感到没办法。区委就注意了对组织员的领导，主要是帮助组织员解决如何正确地掌握党员标准的问题。组织员进行谈话时，区委组织部经常派人去旁听，了解谈话的内容，发现问题。更重要的是选择典型人物进行具体分析，提高大家掌握党员标准的能力。区委组织部曾挑选了各种类型的发展对象，召开组织员会议进行讨论。开始讨论时有不同意见，最后才取得一致。例如：
    北京市公安局外四分局高一之，学生出身，历史清楚，工作踏实。他才进城时，在总务股管理伙食，“三反”运动以前调作人事工作，工作有成绩，埋头苦干，学习努力，现在是青年团支委；一九五○年即申请过入党现在又要求入党。但他的工作魄力不大，工作也没有突出的成绩，对人不大敢进行批评。讨论中，有人认为高一之工作没有突出成绩，“起不了先锋作用”，可发展可不发展。最后大家才肯定了：从高一之的各方面来看，基本上具备了共产党员标准的八项条件，可以发展入党。
    刘永是新建面粉厂搬运工人。“三反”运动以前，他生产就积极，但和群众关系不很好；对过去所受的剥削和压迫认识不清，他说：“受气就不干了。”“三反”运动给他教育很大。在“三反”运动中，他积极地参加了“打虎”队，工作很积极，对群众的态度也变好了，经过谈话也认清了在旧社会所受的压迫。他对共产党和共产主义，也就有了正确的认识。但有些人认为：刘永进步的时间不长，主张不吸收他入党。经过讨论后，大家才一致认为刘永成分好，历史清楚，“三反”运动提高了他的阶级觉悟，生产、工作积极，改正了过去的缺点，基本上够党员标准，应该作为发展对象。
    这次讨论会，等于大家作了一次掌握标准的实地演习。特别是对高一之的讨论，使大家明确认识了对新党员不能有过高要求，如要求有“奇迹”等，这是不正确的。应看这个人是否已具备党员标准，具备了党员标准就应该吸收入党。关于刘永问题的讨论，使大家明确认识到应以发展的观点看人。通过这次会议，组织员在掌握标准的问题上有了进一步的认识，大家都感到再和发展对象谈话，心里就有底了。
    为了使全党都能确切地掌握党员标准接收新党员，区委组织部又特别召开了支部书记联席会议，把组织员讨论的几个发展对象重新摆出来让大家讨论。讨论后，再把组织员讨论的结论向大家传达，给各支部掌握党员标准，起了示范作用。
    七、八月份，原八区本有七十七个发展对象，经组织员谈话，审查出其中有七人觉悟还不高、两人历史还有些问题需要继续调查。
    八区的组织员掌握党员标准的基本方法是对具体对象进行具体分析。他们在和发展对象谈话之前，首先作充分准备：看材料、和支部联系、了解发展对象平时的表现，研究他的症结问题。谈话时要看发展对象是否懂得党员标准八项条件，承认党员标准八项条件，并愿为党员标准八项条件作实际的努力。
    在组织员认为可以发展后，即将申请入党者再交回支部大会讨论通过。
