Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 15th: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers created the highest record of enemy annihilation since last December in September. In a total of 282 operations throughout the month, they annihilated a total of 30,939 enemy troops, exceeding the number of enemies annihilated in August by approximately 6,000. During this month, our army, with unparalleled bravery and tenacity, and employing ingenious and flexible tactics, engaged in a series of repeated positional battles with the enemy, inflicting heavy casualties on them. At the beginning of the month, the focus of the fighting was in the eastern part of the central front. Starting on the evening of the 6th, our army launched a forceful counterattack against the constantly advancing enemy; simultaneously, we captured two high grounds southeast of Kimhwa, and in the subsequent repeated battles, inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, killing over 2,000 enemy troops, and inflicting a severe blow on the ROK Army's Gyeonggi Division. By mid-September, the focus of the fighting shifted to the western front. After the 18th, our army annihilated over 1,000 American troops in the four-day battle for the high ground east of Sangpo-ri northwest of Cheorwon. In the battle for the Seosan hill west of Goya-dai northwest of Yeoncheon, which lasted for thirteen days, nearly 1,000 American troops were killed again. By late September, the focus of the fighting shifted again to the northeast area of Mt. Mundung in the eastern mountain range; in the battle for the high ground east of Jangseung-ri, our army bravely repelled the attacks of an entire regiment of enemy troops supported by aircraft and tanks. At the end of the month, our army, in coordination with powerful artillery fire, launched a series of counterattacks on both the east and west banks of the Bukhan River and controlled an important commanding height on the east bank of the Bukhan River.

    In September, regardless of the size of the enemy's intrusions from the front lines or landings from the sea, without exception, they were annihilated or repelled by our army in a very short period of time. On the 2nd, a company of American troops intruded into a high ground held by our army northwest of Cheorwon. After only half an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy troops were killed or wounded more than 80 people and then collapsed and retreated. On the 9th, two companies of American troops, under the cover of five tanks and artillery fire, intruded again, but were killed or wounded by our army more than 150 people within two hours and then collapsed and retreated. During this month, our army also repelled four enemy landing harassment attempts on the Yeon-an Peninsula front on the west coast.

    In the fighting in September, our army's powerful artillery units and young tank units closely cooperated with the infantry in combat, playing a significant role. In addition to cooperating with the infantry in combat, our artillery units also killed or wounded 7,909 enemy troops independently. Our heroic snipers killed or wounded a total of 6,554 enemy troops in September, accounting for more than 21 percent of the total number of enemies annihilated that month.

    In September, the enemy vainly attempted to reduce its losses in ground operations by strengthening air force activities on the front lines, but the result was quite the opposite. The losses of the enemy's ground forces increased, and the losses of the enemy's air force in the front-line areas also increased. The fact that our army's front-line anti-aircraft units shot down or damaged 181 enemy aircraft this month is a good proof.

    The American aggressor army, which has suffered a serious defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, has not given up its attempt to continue and expand the war of aggression, and has recently announced a complete blockade of the entire coast of Korea. This action conceals an unspeakable conspiracy. No matter what new military adventures the enemy is brewing, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, maintaining a high degree of vigilance, will give the enemy even heavier blows at any time.

    The comprehensive battle results of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in September are as follows: (incomplete statistics)
    1. Annihilated 30,939 enemy troops, including 12,924 American troops, 1,147 British troops, 152 Canadian troops, and 16,716 ROK Army troops.
    2. Major captured items: 2 anti-aircraft guns, 3 recoilless guns, 3 flamethrowers, 11 Bazookas, 11 mortars, 1 anti-aircraft machine gun, 151 light and heavy machine guns, and 836 various guns, and 86 various communication devices.
    3. Shot down 199 enemy aircraft, damaged 268 enemy aircraft, destroyed or damaged 160 enemy vehicles, destroyed or damaged 162 enemy tanks, destroyed or damaged 67 enemy artillery pieces of various types, and sunk 1 enemy destroyer, 1 landing craft, and 1 minesweeper.

    朝中部队九月份歼敌三万余名
    毁伤敌机四百六十七架坦克百六十二辆
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在九月份创造了自去年十二月以来歼敌的最高记录。在全月二百八十二次的作战中，共计歼灭敌军三万零九百三十九名，比八月份的歼敌数字超过了约六千名。在这个月中，我军以无比的英勇和顽强，并运用了巧妙灵活的战术与敌军进行了一连串反复的阵地争夺战，而且在战斗中大量地杀伤了敌人。在月初，战斗的重心在中部战线偏东地区。自六日傍晚开始，我军即向不断进犯的敌人展开有力的反击；同时攻下金城东南两个高地，并在以后的反复争夺战中大量杀伤敌人二千多名，予李伪军京畿师以惨重打击。至九月中旬，战斗的重心移向西线。十八日以后，我军在铁原西北上浦防以东高地的四天争夺战中即歼灭美军千名以上。在涟川西北高阳岱西山的争夺战进行了十三天，又歼美军近千名。至九月下旬，战斗的重心又转向东线丛山峻岭的文登东北地区；在长承里以东的高地争夺战中，我军奋勇击退有飞机和坦克配合的整团敌人的进攻。月底我军在强大炮火配合下又在北汉江东西两岸展开了一连串的反击战，并控制了北汉江东岸的一个重要制高点。
    在九月份里，任凭敌人从正面战线或从海上登陆的大小窜犯，每次都无例外地在很短时间内即被我军歼灭或击退。二日，美军一个连向铁原西北我军一个高地窜犯，激战仅半小时，敌军就被杀伤八十多人后溃退。九日，美军两个连在五辆坦克和炮火掩护下又来窜犯，也只在两小时之内就被我军杀伤一百五十多人后溃退。在这个月中，我军还在西海岸延安半岛前线共击退敌人四次登陆袭扰。
    在九月份的战斗中，我军强大的炮兵部队及年青的战车部队曾密切地配合步兵作战，起了很大作用。除配合步兵作战外，我炮兵部队还单独打死打伤敌军七千九百零九名。我英勇的狙击手在九月份中共射死射伤敌军六千五百五十四名，占全月歼敌总数百分之二十一强。
    九月份中，敌人妄想以加强前线的空军活动减轻其地面作战的损失，但结果恰恰相反。敌军地面部队的损失增多了，敌空军在前线地区的损失也同样增大。我军前线对空射击部队在这个月击落击伤敌机一百八十一架就是很好的证明。
    在侵朝战争中遭受了严重失败的美国侵略军，仍没有放弃其继续并扩大侵略战争的企图，最近又宣布全面地封锁朝鲜全境海岸，这种行动掩盖着一个不可告人的阴谋。不管敌人酝酿什么样新的军事冒险，保持着高度警惕性的朝中人民军队将随时给予敌人以更沉重的打击。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军九月份的综合战果如下：（不完全统计）
    一、歼灭敌军三万零九百三十九名，其中包括美军一万二千九百二十四名，英军一千一百四十七名，加拿大军一百五十二名，李伪军一万六千七百一十六名。
    二、主要缴获：机关炮二门、无后座力炮三门、火焰喷射器三具、九零火箭筒十一具、迫击炮十一门、高射机枪一挺、轻重机枪一百五十一挺和各种枪八百三十六枝，各种通讯机八十六部。
    三、击落敌军飞机一百九十九架，击伤敌军飞机二百六十八架，击毁击伤敌军汽车一百六十辆，击毁击伤敌军坦克一百六十二辆，击毁、击伤敌军各种炮六十七门，击沉敌军驱逐舰、登陆艇、扫雷艇各一艘。
