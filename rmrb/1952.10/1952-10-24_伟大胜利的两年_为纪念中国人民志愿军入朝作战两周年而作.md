Two Years of Great Victory
— Written in Commemoration of the Second Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Entry into Korea to Fight
Piao Yiyu, Representative of the Headquarters of the Korean People's Army stationed with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

All patriotic people of Korea greet with deep gratitude this day of great significance in the history of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea – October 25th, the Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid to Korea.

Two years ago, the independence and freedom of our country faced a new and critical juncture. The U.S. aggressors, following the old path of Japanese imperialism, attempted to destroy all of Korea, ordering their troops to invade our northern regions madly. At this critical moment, our great neighbor, the Chinese people, stepped forward and sent the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to aid our people in jointly resisting the U.S. aggressor troops. The Korean people will never forget that this heroic force, with selfless and heroic combat, helped our people rescue our country from danger.

October 25th was the turning point in our anti-aggression war. In the two years since then, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army and our Korean People's Army, fighting side by side, have victoriously carried out five large-scale campaigns on the Korean battlefield, halting the enemy's frantic offensives and driving them back from the Yalu River to the vicinity of the 38th parallel. The Korean and Chinese People's Armies have consolidated their positions near the 38th parallel, stabilizing the Korean war situation. The democratic and free life of the people in the northern half of our country has been guaranteed, and reconstruction and restoration of production work have begun during the war.

The Korean people, with unparalleled joy, warmly congratulate the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on its great victories in the two years of fighting against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. This victory not only defended our country's independence and freedom, completely shattered the U.S. imperialists' dream of destroying our country and then attacking the Chinese mainland, but also punctured the U.S. imperialists' paper tiger mask, greatly enhancing the world's people's confidence in victory against aggression and in defense of peace. The U.S. imperialists have投入投入 approximately one-third of the total strength of the U.S. Army's regular forces into the Korean battlefield. The technology and equipment of the U.S. invading forces far surpass those of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. However, the U.S. aggressor troops were still defeated. The great victory of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies disrupted the U.S. aggressors' plan to launch a world war and effectively defended peace in the Far East and the world.

Our two countries, China and Korea, have a long tradition of friendship. As far back as 360 years ago, during the Imjin War, the Chinese people sent troops to help our people repel the Japanese pirates' invasion of our country. In the recent half-century, the people of China and Korea have aided each other against a common enemy – Japanese imperialism. In today's struggle against the new enemy – U.S. imperialism – the traditional friendship between the people of China and Korea has undergone new development. This is because our friendly neighbor China is already a New China led by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and our country is already a New Korea led by the Korean Workers' Party and General Kim Il-sung. The people of both countries have become the true masters of their own countries, becoming heroic people inspired by a new spirit of patriotism and internationalism. They love their motherland and defend the independence and freedom of their countries. And when their neighbors are subjected to barbaric aggression by imperialism, they can express deep sympathy and provide great, selfless, and sincere assistance.

In the past two years, the assistance given to our country by the Chinese people has been sincere, great, and selfless. The brotherly friendship developed between the people of China and Korea in combat is precious and inspiring. In our difficult and critical days, the Chinese people, regardless of their fatigue and losses in the long revolutionary war, resolutely dispatched the People's Volunteer Army to help our country and jointly resist the aggression of U.S. imperialism, and have continuously provided our country with assistance in terms of materials and manpower. On the battlefield, the soldiers of China and Korea shed blood and sweat together, closely cooperating, supporting each other, encouraging each other, rescuing each other, and learning from each other, fully demonstrating brotherly affection. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army cherishes the interests of our people anytime, anywhere, truly cherishing every mountain, every river, every blade of grass and tree in Korea, without committing the slightest offense; they cherish our people as they cherish their own parents and siblings. They help the people with production, relieve disaster victims, treat patients, and rescue the lives and property of our people, resulting in thousands and hundreds of internationalist fighters like Luo Shengjiao who sacrificed themselves to save others. Our people sincerely thank the Chinese people and the Volunteer Army for this assistance, and following the instructions of General Kim Il-sung, cherish the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as they cherish their own children—the Korean People's Army, welcoming the Volunteer Army everywhere, helping to repair roads and build bridges, delivering food and boiling water, rescuing the wounded and sick, and intensifying production to support the front lines.

Such unity and friendship between the people and people's armies of China and Korea are built on the foundation of the just cause of anti-aggression, and therefore it is unbreakable. Any despicable rumors and provocations by U.S. imperialism are futile and can never shake or undermine our unity; and our sincere friendship and iron unity are the strong force and important guarantee for continuing to strike heavy blows at the U.S. aggressors and striving for a victorious end to the Korean war against aggression.

The great victory of the Korean war against aggression over the past two years shows that with the reliable assistance of the great Chinese people and the joint combat of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, we have defeated the aggressor troops of more than a dozen countries headed by U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee traitorous army on the Korean battlefield. From this, it can be seen how powerful the entire peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is. In contrast, due to its failure in the Korean war of aggression, the U.S. imperialists' manpower and material resources continue to suffer severe losses on the Korean battlefield, and they are in an increasingly difficult and weak situation. With the failure of U.S. imperialism in the Korean war of aggression, the contradictions between the belligerent ruling class and the broad masses of people in the United States, and the contradictions between the United States and other vassal states invading Korea, are increasingly expanding and deepening. The situation of world development is favorable to the peace and democracy camp, unfavorable to the imperialist aggressive camp; favorable to the Korean and Chinese People's Armies fighting against aggression, and unfavorable to the invading army and the Lee bandits headed by U.S. imperialism. The people and the People's Army of our country fully recognize this favorable situation, looking forward to the future with full confidence in victory. They are determined to unite more closely with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, to fight to the end for the final victory of the Korean war against aggression, and for a peaceful solution to the Korean question!

I wish the Korean and Chinese People's Armies even greater victories in their joint operations in the third year!

    伟大胜利的两年
    ——为纪念中国人民志愿军入朝作战两周年而作
    朝鲜人民军总部驻中国人民志愿军代表　朴一禹
    全朝鲜的爱国人民怀着深深的感激之情，迎接在我们朝鲜民主主义人民共和国历史上具有伟大意义的日子——十月二十五日中国人民志愿军抗美援朝纪念日。
    两年前，我国的独立和自由面临着一个新的危急关头。走日本帝国主义老路的美国侵略者企图灭亡全朝鲜，命令其军队向我国北部疯狂进犯。在这个危急的关头，我国伟大的邻邦中国人民便挺身而出，派遣中国人民志愿军来援助我国人民共同抗击美国侵略军。朝鲜人民永远不能忘记：这支英雄部队以忘我的英勇战斗，帮助我国人民把我国从危急中挽救了出来。
    十月二十五日，是我国反侵略战争的转折点。从那时以来的两年中，英勇的中国人民志愿军和我国人民军一道，在朝鲜战场上胜利地进行了五次大规模的战役，阻止住了敌人的疯狂进攻，并将敌人从鸭绿江边赶回到三八线附近。朝中人民军队已在三八线附近巩固了自己的阵地，使朝鲜战局稳定下来了。我国北半部人民的民主、自由的生活得到了保障，并在战争期间开始了重建和恢复生产的工作。
    朝鲜人民以无比的欢欣，热烈祝贺中国人民志愿军抗美援朝作战两年来的伟大胜利。这个胜利不仅保卫了我国的独立自由，彻底粉碎了美帝国主义灭亡我国、进而进攻中国大陆的迷梦；而且戳穿了美帝国主义的纸老虎的假面具，大大提高了世界人民反对侵略、保卫和平的胜利信心。美帝国主义投入朝鲜战场的陆军部队约占美国陆军正规部队总兵力的三分之一强，美国侵朝军队的技术和装备远远地超过中朝人民军队，然而，美国侵略军仍被打败了。中朝人民军队的伟大胜利，打乱了美国侵略者发动世界战争的计划，有效地保卫了远东和世界的和平。
    我们中朝两国在历史上是有着悠久的传统的友谊的。远在三百六十年以前的壬辰战争中，中国人民曾派出军队帮助我国人民打退了日寇对我国的侵犯。最近半世纪中，中朝两国人民又互相援助反对共同的敌人——日本帝国主义。在今天反对新的敌人——美帝国主义的斗争中，中朝两国人民的传统友谊又有了新的发展。这是因为我们的友邻中国已经是一个由中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导的新中国，我国也已经是一个由朝鲜劳动党和金日成将军领导的新朝鲜。两国人民都成了自己国家的真正主人，成了被新的爱国主义与国际主义精神鼓舞的英雄人民。他们热爱自己的祖国，保卫自己国家的独立和自由。而在自己的邻邦遭到帝国主义的野蛮侵略时，他们便能够表示深厚的同情，进行伟大无私的真诚的援助。
    两年来，中国人民给予我国的援助是真挚的，伟大无私的。中朝两国人民在战斗中发展的兄弟般的友谊是可贵的，令人兴奋鼓舞的。在我国艰难、危急的日子里，中国人民不顾在长期革命战争中的疲惫和损耗，毅然派遣了人民志愿军来帮助我国，共同抵抗美帝国主义的侵略，又不断在物质上、人力上给予我国以援助，中国人民志愿军在战场上忍受和克服一切困难，以忘我的精神英勇作战。在战斗中，中朝人民战士流血流汗在一起，紧密配合，互相支援，互相鼓励，互相救护，互相学习，充分表现了兄弟般的情谊。中国人民志愿军随时随地爱护我国人民的利益，真正做到爱护朝鲜的一山一水，一草一木，秋毫无犯；他们爱护我国人民如同爱护他们自己的父母兄弟。他们帮助人民生产，救济灾民，医疗病人，救护我国人民生命财产，出现了成千成百个罗盛教型的舍己救人的国际主义战士。我国人民衷心感激中国人民和志愿军的这种援助，并遵照金日成将军的指示，爱护中国人民志愿军如同爱护自己的儿女——朝鲜人民军一样，到处欢迎志愿军，帮助修路架桥，送饭烧水，救护伤病员，加紧生产支援前线。
    中朝人民及其人民军队的这种团结和友谊是建立在反侵略的正义事业的基础上的，因而它是牢不可破的。美帝国主义任何的可耻造谣，挑拨离间，都是徒然的，是绝不能动摇和破坏我们的团结的；而我们之间的真诚友谊和铁的团结，正是继续沉重地打击美国侵略者、争取朝鲜反侵略战争胜利结束的坚强力量和重要保证。
    两年来朝鲜反侵略战争的伟大胜利说明：我们有了伟大的中国人民的可靠援助，有了中国人民志愿军的并肩作战，我们就在朝鲜战场上打败了以美帝国主义为首的十多个国家的侵略军和李承晚卖国军。由此可见，以苏联为首的整个和平民主阵营的力量是何等强大。与此相反，美帝国主义由于在侵朝战争中的失败，它的人力、物力继续在朝鲜战场上遭到严重的消耗，因而已处在愈战愈困难，愈战愈弱的悲惨境况中。随着美帝国主义在侵朝战争中的失败，美国国内好战的统治阶级与广大人民之间的矛盾，美国与其他侵朝的附庸国家之间的矛盾，正在日益扩大和加深。世界发展的形势有利于和平民主阵营，不利于帝国主义侵略阵营；有利于进行反侵略战争的中朝人民军队，不利于以美帝国主义为首的侵略军和李匪军。我国人民和人民军充分认清了这种有利形势，满怀着胜利信心瞻望着未来，他们坚决和中国人民志愿军更加亲密团结，为争取朝鲜反侵略战争的最后胜利，为和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗到底！
    预祝中朝人民军队在第三年的共同作战中获得更加伟大的胜利！
