    Beijing Post Office Promptly Handles Letters from the Public

    To the Editor: The Beijing Post Office attaches great importance to letters from the public and promptly handles all letters from the people raising suggestions, inquiries, requests, etc., to the post office. The "Public Service Section" of the bureau registers all letters and opinion forms (sent by the bureau to people from all walks of life) it receives. If the section can answer them, it immediately writes back or answers by telephone. If it needs to forward them to relevant departments for comments or needs to be handled after research by leading departments, it immediately forwards them, and after a decision is made, it immediately replies to the letter writer. The "Public Service Section" also often attaches relevant promotional materials in the reply letter for the letter writer's reference. For example, if someone does not understand the scope of the post office's "solicitation" and "purchase on behalf" services, a description of these services is attached; if someone does not understand the mail delivery zoning situation, a delivery zoning map is attached. In this way, people from all walks of life feel very convenient. Many people write letters saying: "Now it is truly the people's postal service led by Chairman Mao, and it is doing so well." "The current postal staff are worlds apart in their work and attitude compared to before liberation." According to preliminary statistics from the section, from January to June of this year, it received 203 letters and 583 opinion forms from people from all walks of life; replied to 431 letters; and sent out 1,294 letters soliciting opinions. In addition, it answered 2,421 inquiries over the phone. In order to cooperate with the patriotic production increase movement, the section has included "promptly and accurately handling public issues" in its work plan.

    北京邮局及时处理群众来信
    编辑同志：北京邮局很重视群众来信，凡是人民群众向邮局提出建议、询问、要求等的来信，都能及时处理。该局“公众服务股”收到各界人民来信和意见表（该局寄发各界人民的），就分别登记，本股能解答的，马上写回信或用电话解答，需要转相关部门签注意见或需经领导部门研究后办理的，马上转出，决定办法后即函复来信人。“公众服务股”还经常把有关的宣传品，附在复信里赠送来信人参考。譬如有人不了解邮局的“征询”和“代购”等业务范围，就附送介绍这些业务的说明书；有人不明白邮件投递分区的情况，就附送投递分区图。这样，各界人民都感到很方便。许多人来信说：“现在真是毛主席领导的人民邮政，办得这样好。”“现在的邮政人员在工作上、态度上和解放前比较有天渊之别。”据该股初步统计，今年一月到六月，收到各界人民来信二百零三件，意见表五百八十三件；复信四百三十一件；发出征求意见的信一千二百九十四件，另外还在电话上解答过询问二千四百二十一次。该股为了配合爱国增产运动，已把“迅速准确地处理公众的问题”订入工作计划。
