The upcoming Peace Conference for Asia and the Pacific Region in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, is a momentous event of great international significance.

The peace conference in Beijing, like the preparations in various countries for the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna in December, clearly demonstrates the great and insurmountable power of the peace movement among all nations.

"Peace can be preserved and consolidated if the people of all countries take up the cause of defending peace and defend it to the end." - Comrade Stalin's wise words inspire peace defenders in all countries.

For the first time in history, representatives of various nations that have endured centuries of colonial oppression, and most of whom still suffer from it, will gather at the peace conference in Beijing. The conference will discuss the most important issues that agitate the people of Asia and the Pacific region, and will formulate a plan to defend peace in this region of the Earth.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said: "This conference of ours is a people's representative meeting, and its purpose is upright and just. Our purpose is to save peace. We demand the democratization of Japan and oppose the resurgence of Japanese militarism; we demand universal disarmament and oppose the use of atomic, bacteriological, and chemical weapons of mass destruction;... we demand a swift and peaceful resolution of the issues in Korea and Southeast Asian countries, and oppose violent interference in the internal affairs of other countries. These purposes are upright and just, and they are not only the wishes of the people of Asia and the Pacific region, but also the common wishes of peace-loving and just people all over the world."

The people of Asia and the Pacific region will demonstrate at the conference the strength they have grown, their firm determination to defend peace, and deliver a rebuff to the instigators of a new world war.

U.S. imperialism has consistently pursued a policy of aggression in the Asia and Pacific region. After crushing Japanese militarism, American monopoly capitalists put forward a plan to turn this continent into an American colony. However, the U.S. imperialists' hope of completely enslaving Asia has been shattered. In the countries of Asia and the Pacific, the national liberation movement has gained the widest scope. The victory of the Chinese revolution, completed with the establishment of the People's Republic of China, dealt the most powerful blow to the imperialist colonial system.

After suffering a defeat in China, the U.S. imperialists intensified their aggressive activities. They provoked a predatory war of aggression in Korea and, in the course of the war, used the most barbarous methods to massacre peaceful residents. However, their attempts to force the heroic Korean people to their knees and to intimidate all the people of the Asia and Pacific region with various barbaric methods of warfare have gone bankrupt. The freedom-loving Korean people, with the support of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, bravely repelled all attacks by the interventionists. The brave example of the Korean people inspires all the other people of Asia and the Pacific region who are fighting against the colonialists and for national independence.

The U.S. imperialists are attempting to find support in Asia from the Japanese militarists, who have not been eliminated. The separate peace treaty with Japan, forced by Washington, aims to turn the country into an American colony and an American military base. The American foreign policy of concluding the so-called "Pacific Pact" aims to accelerate and expand preparations for aggressive war.

The people of Asia, the Pacific region, and Latin America understand that these conspiracies of the American ruling clique will cause new sharpenings of international relations. The awareness of the growing threat of war awakens them to redouble their efforts in the struggle for peace and against the warmongers.

The population of the countries in Asia and the Pacific region accounts for more than two-thirds of the world's population. Sixteen hundred million people live in this region. These people have experienced all the burdens of war. They deeply hate imperialist enslavement. They are increasingly aware that the success of the cause of defending peace and the success of the liberation movement largely depend on their activity in the struggle against the imperialist warmongers.

The characteristic of the peace movement in Asia and the Pacific region is the rapid progress of this movement. The broad masses of the people are joining the active struggle against the instigators of a new world war.

The preparations for the Beijing conference, which are widely unfolding in the countries of Asia and the Pacific region, mark a new upsurge in the struggle for peace, and representatives from more than thirty countries should participate in this conference. In many countries, national congresses for the defense of peace have been held, and at these congresses, the determination of the people of all ethnic groups to defend peace more actively has been expressed. The delegates to the conferences were elected at thousands of meetings of workers, peasants, and intellectuals.

The Third All-India Peace Congress was convened not long ago, and the Congress solemnly declared that the Indian people have always been peace-loving people and hate war. The Congress, representing hundreds of millions of Indians, demanded: Do not use India's resources, people, ports, and airfields for aggressive war, and do not participate in treaties and agreements that could drag India into foreign aggression plans and undermine India's sovereignty. In a special resolution on "Peace in Korea," the Congress said that the Indian people declared that "they are completely unrelated to the inhuman actions carried out in Korea under the guise of the United Nations, and are willing to condemn such actions together with the people of other countries in the world."

The powerful upsurge of the peace movement in Japan is of great significance. Tens of millions of demonstrations protesting the re-militarization of Japan by American imperialists and rallies defending national independence, opposing American occupation, and opposing turning Japan into an American military base have been held in many cities and villages.

In Pakistan and Burma, Indonesia and Thailand, Vietnam and Malaya—in every country in Asia, preparations for the conference are accompanied by a strong upsurge in the struggle for peace. The people of Latin American countries—Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala—are also sending their representatives to Beijing.

The Chinese people greet the peace conference with great achievements in building a new life. China has reached the pre-war level of production, and at the same time, it has exceeded the pre-war level of production in both industry and agriculture. A foundation has been laid for the transition to large-scale economic construction. The achievements of the People's Republic of China are of great international significance because they enhance the confidence of the nations of the East in their own strength and abilities and point them to an example of struggle for peace, national independence, and freedom.

The call of the Korean National Peace Defense Congress, which was held not long ago, has penetrated the hearts of every simple person. In the enthusiastic declaration adopted at the conference, the Korean people declared that peace triumphing over the aggressive forces waging war in Korea is a great contribution to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world.

The Soviet people are sending their representatives to the peace conference in Beijing. Our people, engaged in peaceful and constructive labor, persistently and tirelessly fight for peace and defend the cause of peace.

The people of the whole world congratulate the convening of the Peace Conference for Asia and the Pacific region. The powerful peace movement convincingly proves that the people have the insurmountable power to stop the aggressors and defend peace throughout the world.

    和平保卫者的力量在增长
    ——苏联真理报九月二十三日社论
    最近在中华人民共和国的首都北京，将召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。这次会议的召开，是巨大的具有国际意义的事件。
    在北京召开的和平会议，和各国正在展开的对十二月将在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会的筹备工作一样，显明地表示出各族人民保卫和平运动的伟大的和不可克服的力量。
    “如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”——斯大林同志的这句英明的话，鼓舞着各国的和平保卫者们。
    几世纪来经受了殖民地压迫而且大多数直到现在仍然遭受着殖民地压迫的各族人民的代表们，将在北京的和平会议上有史以来第一次聚会在一起。会议将讨论使亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民激动的最重要问题，将制订保卫地球上这一地区的和平的方案。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若说：“我们这一次的会议是人民代表会议，目的是正大光明的。我们的目的就是要拯救和平。我们要求日本民主化、反对日本的重新军国主义化；要求普遍裁军、反对使用大量杀人的原子能、细菌、化学武器；……要求朝鲜及东南亚各国的问题迅速地得到和平解决，反对以暴力干涉别人内政。这些目的是正大光明的，不仅是亚洲及太平洋区域人民的愿望，也是全世界爱好和平正义的人民的共同愿望。”
    亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，将在会议上表明他们已经增长了的力量，表明他们保卫和平的坚强决心并给新世界战争的挑拨者一个反击。
    美帝国主义在亚洲及太平洋地区一贯进行着侵略政策。在粉碎日本军国主义之后，美国垄断资本家们就提出了变这一洲为美国殖民地的计划。然而美帝国主义者全部奴役亚洲的指望是被打碎了。在亚洲及太平洋各国，民族解放运动获得了最广泛的规模。以建立了中华人民共和国而完成的中国革命的胜利，给了帝国主义殖民制度一个最有力的打击。
    美帝国主义者在中国遭受到失败以后，便加强了它们的侵略活动。他们在朝鲜挑起了掠夺性的侵略战争，并在战争过程中使用最野蛮的屠杀和平居民的方法。但是，他们迫使英勇的朝鲜人民屈膝、以进行战争的各种野蛮方法来威吓亚洲及太平洋区域全体人民的企图，已经破产了。爱好自由的朝鲜人民，在英雄的中国人民志愿军的支援下，勇敢地打退干涉者的一切进攻。朝鲜人民的勇敢榜样，鼓舞着亚洲及太平洋区其他为反对殖民者、争取民族独立而斗争着的全体人民。
    美帝国主义者企图在亚洲从没有被消灭的日本军国主义者方面来寻找支柱。被华盛顿所强迫签订的单独对日和约，其目的就是把这个国家变成美国的殖民地，变成美国的军事基地。美国关于缔结所谓
    “太平洋公约”的外交政策，旨在加速和扩大侵略战争的准备。
    亚洲、太平洋地区和拉丁美洲的人民懂得，美国统治集团的这些阴谋将引起国际关系新的尖锐化。对于增长着的战争威胁的认识，唤起他们加倍努力从事争取和平、反对战争贩子的斗争。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国的人口占全人类三分之二以上。这个区域居住着十六亿人。这些人体验过战争的一切重荷。他们深深地憎恨帝国主义的奴役。他们愈来愈意识到，保卫和平事业的成功，解放运动的成功，在很大的程度上有赖于他们在反对帝国主义战争贩子的斗争中的积极性。
    亚洲及太平洋各国保卫和平运动的特点，是这一运动的突飞猛进。广大的人民群众都加入反对新世界战争挑拨者的积极斗争中。
    在亚洲及太平洋区域各国广泛展开的对北京会议的筹备工作，标志着争取和平斗争的新高涨，在这次会议上应有三十多个国家的代表参加。在许多国家中，都举行了保卫和平的全国代表大会，在这些代表大会上表示出各族人民更加积极地保卫和平的决心。会议的代表们是在工人、农民和知识分子的成千的会议上选举出来的。
    不久以前召开了第三届全印度和平大会，大会郑重地宣称，印度人民一向是爱好和平的人民，而且是憎恨战争的。大会代表着数亿印度人要求：不要把印度的资源、人、海港和飞机场供用于侵略战争，不要参加能够把印度拖入外国的侵略计划和破坏印度主权的条约和协定。大会在“关于朝鲜的和平”的特别决议中说，印度人民宣布“跟假借联合国名义在朝鲜所干的非人道的行动是完全不相干的，并愿和世界其他国家人民一道谴责这种行动。”
    日本保卫和平运动的有力的高涨，具有重要的意义。千千万万的抗议美国帝国主义分子使日本重新军国主义化的示威和保卫国家独立、反对美国占领，反对把日本变成美国军事根据地的集会，在许多城市和农村都举行了。
    在巴基斯坦和缅甸，印度尼西亚和泰国，越南和马来亚——在亚洲的各个国家中，对大会的准备工作伴随着争取和平斗争的强有力的高涨。拉丁美洲各国——墨西哥、哥伦比亚、智利、秘鲁、厄瓜多尔、危地马拉——的人民也把自己的代表送向北京。
    中国人民以建设新生活中的巨大成就来迎接和平会议。中国达到了战前的生产水平，同时不论在工业或农业方面都超过了战前的生产水平。为过渡到大规模的经济建设奠定了基础。中华人民共和国的成就有着巨大的国际意义，因为它提高了东方各民族对自己力量和能力的信心，指给他们争取和平、民族独立和自由的斗争的榜样。
    不久以前举行了的朝鲜全国保卫和平大会的号召深入了每个纯朴人的心。在大会上所通过的热烈的宣言中，朝鲜人民宣称，和平战胜在朝鲜进行战争的侵略力量，是保卫亚洲和全世界和平事业中的巨大贡献。
    苏联人民把自己的代表送向北京的和平会议。从事和平建设性劳动的我国人民，坚持和不倦地为争取和平而战并保卫着和平事业。
    全世界的人民都祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开。强有力的保卫和平运动使人信服地证明，人民有着能够制止侵略者和保卫全世界和平的不可克服的力量。
