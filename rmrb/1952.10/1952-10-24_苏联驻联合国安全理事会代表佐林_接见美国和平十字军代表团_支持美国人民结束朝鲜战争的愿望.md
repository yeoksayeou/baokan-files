Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd, TASS, New York: The Soviet Representative to the United Nations Security Council, Zorin, received a delegation of American Peace Crusaders on October 20th. The delegation was led by Richardson, one of the leaders of the Peace Crusaders.

The delegation included prominent representatives of the American progressive movement, Uphaus and Balong, as well as leaders of local branches of the American Peace Crusaders and trade union representatives from New York, Connecticut, and several other states.

The delegates spoke about the American Peace Crusaders' struggle for peace, pointing out that their organization reflects the desire of the vast majority of the American people for an immediate end to the Korean War and a peaceful resolution of all other international issues.

Richardson, on behalf of the delegation, said: In view of the increasing anxiety of the American people regarding the continuation of the Korean War and the lack of any measures taken by the American government to end this war, the American Peace Crusaders have decided to appeal to all United Nations member state delegations to take steps at this General Assembly to immediately stop the Korean War.

The delegates spoke about their impressions from visiting representatives of several United Nations member states, including the United States, saying that these countries' representatives did not even want to take measures to end the Korean War before the results of the American presidential election were revealed. They said that the American representatives blamed the failure of the Korean negotiations on the Korean and Chinese sides.

Zorin answered the questions raised by the delegation in detail, pointing out that the Soviet government has always strived for world peace and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This time, in the speech of the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, he expressed support for the proposal put forward by the Polish delegation, which advocated eliminating the threat of another world war, strengthening peace and friendly cooperation among all peoples, and advocated stopping the shameful Korean War.

Zorin pointed out that the rumors spread by American newspapers and American official representatives that the interruption of the Korean armistice negotiations was the fault of the Korean and Chinese sides were fabricated. He also proved that it was none other than the US military command in Korea that disrupted the negotiations, and they even refused to discuss the suggestions recently put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides, which could have served as the basis for reaching an agreement on the prisoner-of-war issue.

Zorin emphasized that the US military command and American newspapers believed that even the representatives attending the United Nations General Assembly should not be allowed to see the proposals from the Korean and Chinese sides.

The members of the Peace Crusaders delegation sincerely thanked Zorin and assured him that the organization they represented would tirelessly strive for peace, and first and foremost, to end the Korean War.

    苏联驻联合国安全理事会代表佐林
    接见美国和平十字军代表团
    支持美国人民结束朝鲜战争的愿望
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：苏联驻联合国安全理事会代表佐林在十月二十日接见了美国和平十字军的一个代表团，率领代表团的是和平十字军领袖之一李查逊。
    代表团里有美国进步运动著名代表厄普豪斯和巴奥朗，纽约、康涅狄格及其他几州的美国和平十字军地方支部的领袖和工会代表。
    代表们谈到美国和平十字军进行争取和平斗争的情形，并且指出，他们的组织反映绝大多数美国人民要求立即停止朝鲜战争与和平解决其他一切国际问题的愿望。
    李查逊代表代表团说：鉴于美国人民对于朝鲜战争继续进行以及美国政府并未采取任何措施结束这个战争日益感到焦虑，美国和平十字军决定吁请全体联合国会员国代表团在本届大会上采取步骤立即制止朝鲜战争。
    代表们谈到他们访问包括美国在内的一些联合国会员国的代表的印象说：这些国家的代表甚至不想在美国总统选举结果揭晓以前采取措施结束朝鲜战争。他们说：美国代表把朝鲜谈判失败的责任推在朝中方面。
    佐林详细答复了代表团所提出的问题，并指出：苏联政府始终为世界和平与和平解决朝鲜问题而努力，这一次又在苏联代表团团长维辛斯基的演说中表示支持波兰代表团所提出的建议，这建议主张消除另一次世界大战威胁，加强和平与各国人民友好合作，并主张制止可耻的朝鲜战争。
    佐林指出美国报纸和美国官方代表散布的所谓朝鲜停战谈判中断是朝中方面的过失的谣言是虚构的。他并且证明：破坏谈判的不是别人，正是在朝鲜的美军司令部，他们甚至拒绝讨论朝中方面最近提出的本可以作为达成战俘问题协议的基础的建议。
    佐林强调说：美军司令部和美国报纸认为甚至不能让出席联合国大会的代表看到朝中方面的建议。
    和平十字军代表团团员们诚挚地向佐林道谢，并向他保证，他们所代表的组织将不倦地为争取和平，首先为争取结束朝鲜战争而奋斗。
