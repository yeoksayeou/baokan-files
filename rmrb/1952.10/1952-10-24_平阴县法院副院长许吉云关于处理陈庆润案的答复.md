    Response from Xu Jiyun, Deputy President of Pingyin County Court, Regarding the Handling of the Chen Qingrun Case
    Comrade Editor: We sincerely accept the criticism from Comrade Li Zemin published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on August 27 regarding our court's delay in handling the Chen Qingrun case of abuse of his wife.

    We were unaware of the incident in which Chen Qingrun's wife, Chen Li, unable to bear the abuse, took her two children to commit suicide by drowning. This demonstrates the seriousness of our bureaucracy. When we accepted the case, Chen Qingrun had already fled in fear of punishment. However, we explained the policies to Chen Li and provided her with education. Once Chen Qingrun is apprehended, we will promptly handle the matter. In addition, Chen Li has already applied to the court for a divorce from Chen Qingrun, which we have granted. We have also awarded her three mu of land, and she will have custody of the younger daughter.

    We hope readers will continue to offer opinions on our work to help us improve.
    Xu Jiyun, Deputy President, Pingyin County People's Court, Shandong Province

    平阴县法院副院长许吉云关于处理陈庆润案的答复
    编辑同志：八月二十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表的李泽民同志对我院拖延处理陈庆润虐待妻子案的批评，我们诚恳接受。
    陈庆润的妻子陈李氏不堪受虐待而带着两个孩子去投水自杀的事件发生后，我们还不知道，这说明我们的官僚主义是严重的。我们受理该案时，陈庆润已畏罪潜逃。但我们对陈李氏已说明政策并已进行教育。待陈庆润归案后，我们当迅速处理。另外，陈李氏已经来法院申请和陈庆润离婚，我们准她离婚了，并且判给她土地三亩，小女孩也归她抚养。
    希望读者继续对我们的工作提出意见，帮助我们改进工作。
    山东省平阴县人民法院副院长　许吉云
