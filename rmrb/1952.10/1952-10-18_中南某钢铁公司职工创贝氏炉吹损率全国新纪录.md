    Workers of a Steel Company in Central and Southern China Set New National Record for Bessemer Converter Blow Loss Rate
    Bessemer converter workers and staff of a steel plant in a steel company in Central and Southern China, under the leadership of Liu Weizhen, the section chief of the Bessemer converter section and a model worker, recently created a new national record of 6% for the Bessemer converter blow loss rate. The average blow loss rate of the Bessemer converter was also reduced by 9.38%, which can save the country 9.789 billion yuan of wealth every year. The company's Bessemer converter adopts low-silicon blowing operation, and the average blow loss rate in the past was 20.3%, resulting in a large loss of molten iron. At the end of last year, model worker Liu Weizhen and others studied and improved the operating methods, which greatly reduced the blow loss rate. However, because it was not summarized and promoted, some workers still blew according to their old methods. This time, after the increase production and practice economy movement was launched, Liu Weizhen and others reorganized the experiment and measurement. The average blow loss rate gradually decreased, creating a new national record. According to the summary of these two experiments, the new operating method is: after each furnace is blown for three to four minutes (before the silicon flame begins to boil), start releasing air, with the air pressure at about 30 mm of mercury column, and rock the furnace to zero or five degrees to minimize the amount of molten liquid ejected from the furnace. When the carbon flame becomes violent, increase the amount of air released again.

    中南某钢铁公司职工创贝氏炉吹损率全国新纪录
    中南某钢铁公司炼钢厂贝氏炉工人职员，在贝氏炉工段段长、劳动模范刘维振领导下，于最近创造了贝氏炉吹损率百分之六的全国新纪录。贝氏炉的平均吹损率也比过去降低百分之九点三八，每年可为国家节约九十七亿八千九百多万元的财富。该公司贝氏炉采取低矽吹炼作业，过去平均吹损率为百分之二十点三，铁水损失很大。去年年底劳动模范刘维振等曾研究改进操作方法，使吹损率大为降低。但因没有加以总结推广，有的工人还是按照自己的老办法吹炼。这次，增产节约运动开展以后，刘维振他们重新组织试验和测定。平均吹损率逐渐降低，创造了全国新纪录。根据这两次试验的总结，新的操作方法是：每炉吹炼到三、四分钟以后（矽焰未开始沸腾前），即开始放风，风压在水银柱三十公厘左右，并将炉子摇到零度或五度上，使炉内熔液很少喷出。一直到炭焰凶烈时，又增大放风量。
