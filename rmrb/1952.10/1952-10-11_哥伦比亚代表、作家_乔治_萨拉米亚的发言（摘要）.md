    Colombian Representative and Writer
    Jorge Zalamea's Speech (Abstract)
    The United States has violated the solemn guarantees it made in Potsdam to make Japan a peaceful and democratic country, and is now turning this "Land of the Rising Sun" into its largest base for aggression against Asian countries, and closing the door for them to promote culture and trade with countries in the Western Pacific and the people of the Americas. This action by the United States has a dual significance, implying that the fate and direction of Latin America in the coming centuries will undergo fundamental changes. The re-militarization of Japan will inevitably lead to the militarization of Latin America, for which bilateral agreements have long been prepared.
    To facilitate the militarization of our countries under foreign rule, the Washington government will increasingly interfere in the internal affairs of these countries.
    The people of Colombia already understand what the collusion between domestic reactionaries and foreign warmongers means. They have also suffered the great disasters that come with militarization. Our situation should be a warning to other Latin American countries. We call on the Latin American representatives attending this conference to do everything in their power, work tirelessly and fearlessly, to defeat those schemes.
    Indeed, the scale of our work may be limited, but this limitation must be transformed into more intensified action, conveying the beliefs we have gained to our people. The Colombian delegation believes that this Asian and Pacific Regions People's Conference is an absolutely necessary precursor to the Vienna World People's Peace Congress, which will be written in history as a great day and a sign of the glorious victory of the struggle for peace. Today we work with you in this belief, and tomorrow we will work with our own people in the same belief.
    Our delegation would like to express warm praise and sincere thanks to the preparatory committee of this conference, and with great emotion, deeply appreciates the hospitality and friendship given to us by the incomparable Chinese people. The Chinese people show us at every moment the noble qualities of the human spirit, qualities that we never knew or have forgotten. Sometimes their humble nobility makes us ashamed of our rudeness in the face of the finest products of civilization.
    The happiness of the people is the only correct measure of the great spirit of their leaders. Now everyone knows that the Chinese people are building their new homeland with great joy, bringing new life to their long-standing destiny. In this way, it is not difficult for us to measure the greatness of Mao Zedong. The Colombian delegation hopes with reverence that the greatest happiness of the Chinese people will continue to be a yardstick at all times and in all circumstances. (Xinhua News Agency)

    哥伦比亚代表、作家
    乔治·萨拉米亚的发言（摘要）
    美国违背了它在波茨坦所作的使日本成为一个和平民主国家的庄严保证，现在正在使这个“日出之国”成为它侵略亚洲各国的最大基地，并且关上了他们向西太平洋各国和美洲人民推广文化和贸易的门户。美国这种行动有着双重意义，暗示着拉丁美洲在今后几世纪中的命运和方向将要起基本上的变化。日本的重新军国主义化将必然地引起拉丁美洲的军国主义化，而双边协定早就为此作好了准备。
    为了便于使我们的国家在外国的统治下军国主义化，华盛顿政府将越来越要干涉这些国家的内政。
    哥伦比亚人民已经了解国内反动派与外国战争贩子之间的勾结意味着什么。他们也遭受过随军国主义化而来的大灾难。我国的境遇对于拉丁美洲其他国家应当是一个警告，我们要求参加这次会议的拉丁美洲代表们竭尽全力，始终不懈并不怕牺牲地努力工作，来击败那些诡计。
    的确，我们的工作规模可能是受到限制的，可是这种限制必须化成更为加强的行动，把我们所获得的信念传达给我们的人民。哥伦比亚代表团相信，这次亚洲及太平洋区域人民的大会是维也纳世界人民和平大会的绝对必要的前驱，这个大会将写在历史里，作为一个伟大的日期以及争取和平的斗争获得辉煌胜利的标志。今天我们本着这个信念和你们一起工作，明天我们就要本着同样的信念和我们自己的人民一起工作了。
    我们代表团愿意向这次会议的筹备委员会表示热烈的赞美和诚挚的感谢，并且怀着非常激动的心情，深深地感激着无比的中国人民所给予我们的招待和友谊。中国人民每时每刻都对我们显示人类精神的崇高品质，这种品质是我们从不知道或者已经忘记了的。有时他们谦虚的高贵品质使我们在最美好的文明产品之前为自己的粗野而感到惭愧。
    人民的幸福是衡量他们领袖们伟大精神的唯一正确的尺度。现在大家都知道，中国人民正在怀着极其愉快的心情建设他们新的家园，给他们历史悠久的命运带来新生。这样，我们就不难衡量毛泽东伟大之处。哥伦比亚代表团怀着崇敬的心情希望在无论什么时候和在无论什么情况下，中国人民最大的幸福将继续成为一个准尺。    （新华社）
