    Promoting the Mobile Medical Service in Workshops
    A month ago, the medical staff of the No. 1 Factory of the Northeast Mechanical Industry Bureau went deep into the workshops to treat workers, which achieved good results. Recently, the medical staff of Beijing People's Printing Factory and the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory also organized medical teams and medical stations to go deep into the workshops, solving the difficulty for workers to see a doctor and boosting the workers' production morale. This once again proves that this is a good working method and should be promoted.
    Although the medical equipment of state-owned factories and mines has been greatly improved in the past three years, and the number of medical staff has also increased day by day, its development speed still cannot keep up with the needs of the workers. In addition, the workers cannot leave the workshop during production time, so the time for seeing a doctor is crowded together. Therefore, in many factories and mines, workers have to wait a long time to see a doctor, even delaying production; the medical staff are too busy because there are too many patients during the consultation time. In particular, the thinking of some medical staff has not been well transformed, and they lack a serious and responsible attitude towards workers' illnesses, which also affects the relationship between workers and medical staff.
    After the implementation of mobile medical treatment in workshops, these contradictions have been resolved. First of all, medical staff going deep into the workshops for treatment can greatly shorten the waiting time for workers to see a doctor, which also increases the workers' production time. At the same time, with ample consultation time, the diagnosis can be more detailed. This is of great benefit to ensuring the health of workers. Secondly, medical staff serving workers in the workshops strengthens the unity between workers and medical staff. It is also convenient for medical staff to deeply find out the causes of workers' illnesses and propose preventive measures from a positive perspective to improve sanitary conditions.
    Some medical staff said: "We do not directly participate in production, so we cannot increase production and practice economy." This view is obviously wrong. The experience of Beijing People's Printing Factory and others proves that medical staff going deep into the workshops to serve the working masses solves their difficulties in seeking medical treatment and greatly encourages their enthusiasm for increasing production and practicing economy. Therefore, medical workers also have a share in the completion of the enterprise's task of increasing production and practicing economy. It is hard to imagine that the workers' health conditions are in a mess, and they can still do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy.
    After the "Three-Anti" Movement, the ideology and work style of medical staff have changed a lot, and they have established the concept of serving the masses. Therefore, this new working style and working method have emerged. All medical staff in factories and mines should promote this method and learn the new working style of these medical staff.

### 推广车间巡回医疗法

    推广车间巡回医疗法
    在一个月以前，东北机械工业管理局第一厂的医务人员，深入车间为职工治病，收到很好的效果。最近，北京人民印刷厂、国营天津第二棉纺织厂医务人员也组织医疗组和医疗站深入车间，解决了职工看病的困难，鼓舞了职工生产情绪，再一次证明了这是一个好的工作方法，应当加以推广。
    国营厂矿企业的医疗设备，三年来虽然有很大改进，医务人员也日益增多，但其发展速度还是赶不上工人的需要，加之工人们生产时间不能离开车间，看病时间就挤在一起。所以，许多厂矿企业中工人看病一直要等很长时间，甚至耽误生产；医务人员则由于看病时间的病人太多，忙不过来。特别是某些医务人员的思想还未得到很好改造，缺乏以认真负责的态度对待工人的疾病，也影响工人和医务人员的关系。
    车间巡回治疗实行后，解决了这些矛盾。首先，医务人员深入车间治疗，可以大大缩短工人看病候诊时间，也就增加了工人生产的时间，同时，看病时间充裕，诊断也能比较细致。这对保障工人身体健康有很大益处。其次，医务人员下车间为工人服务，加强了工人和医务人员的团结。医务人员也便于深入地找出工人生病的原因，从积极方面提出预防的办法，改善卫生条件。
    有些医务人员说：“我们不直接参加生产，不能增产节约。”这种看法显然是错误的。北京人民印刷厂等的经验证明，医务人员深入车间为职工群众服务，解决了他们治病的困难，大大地鼓舞了他们增产节约的热情，因此企业增产节约任务的完成，医务工作者也是有份的。很难想像工人的卫生状况一团糟，还能把增产节约搞好。
    医务人员在“三反”运动以后，思想作风已有很多改变，树立了为群众服务的观点，所以才有这种新的工作作风和工作方法的出现。一切厂矿企业的医务人员，都应推广这种方法，学习这些医务人员的新的工作作风。
