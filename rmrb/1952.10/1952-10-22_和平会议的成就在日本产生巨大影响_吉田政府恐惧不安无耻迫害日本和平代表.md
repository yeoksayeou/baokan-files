    The Achievements of the Peace Conference Have Generated a Huge Impact in Japan
    The Yoshida Government, Fearful and Uneasy, Shamelessly Persecutes Japanese Peace Delegates
    [Xinhua News Agency, 21st] The Japanese Yoshida government, which is actively reviving militarism under the instructions of the US government, feels great fear and unease about the huge impact that the successful conclusion of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has had in Japan. It is now employing despicable means of further persecuting the Japanese representatives who attended the Peace Conference in an attempt to stifle the Japanese people's struggle to thoroughly implement the resolutions of the Peace Conference.
    It is reported that on the 16th, the Yoshida government issued arrest warrants for seven Japanese representatives who participated in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, namely, Togo Kameda, Kiyoshi Ozawa, Hiroki Kojima, Shunpei Fukui, Wan'emon Nakamura, Kinkichi Ogura, and Kenta Kaneko. At the same time, one thousand policemen raided the Japanese Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, the "Shin-engeki" theater troupe, and the residences of the aforementioned representatives. Representatives of the Japanese Communist Party, the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, and the "Shin-engeki" theater troupe resolutely protested the above-mentioned persecution by the police to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 16th.
    Under the direction of the US government, the Yoshida government had used the shameless means of refusing to issue passports to Japanese peace representatives and instructing secret agent thugs to beat them up in order to obstruct and prevent Japanese peace representatives from attending the Peace Conference. It fantasized that this would disrupt the convening and success of the Peace Conference. The Tokyo "Observer" said triumphantly on September 24: "Because the Japanese government refused to issue passports to the sixty Japanese representatives attending the conference, this move caused the conference to lose some propaganda value at the beginning." (AFP, Tokyo, September 24) However, thirteen Japanese peace representatives, led by Wan'emon Nakamura, representing Jiichiro Matsumoto, finally broke through the various obstacles of the Yoshida government, overcame many difficulties, arrived in Beijing, and participated in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. According to Kyodo News, the Yoshida government showed "a rather flustered appearance." This panic of the Yoshida government is not difficult to understand, because it finally failed to prevent the representatives of the Japanese people from using the Peace Conference to accuse the American occupiers and Japanese reactionaries of their crimes to the people of Asia, the Pacific, and the world, and to express the Japanese people's desire and determination for independence, democracy, freedom, and peace.
    What particularly alarmed the Yoshida government was that the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions extended a hand of friendship to the Japanese people through the Peace Conference, and made resolutions on the Japanese issue and other resolutions that were in line with the wishes of the Japanese people. Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo, on the 13th, admitted that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference "will play an important role." The Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Asahi Shimbun" on the 13th also had to acknowledge: "The significance of the Beijing Conference (referring to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference) attended by representatives from thirty-seven countries cannot be underestimated. This conference is extremely important for Asia."
    The fact is that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, convened to represent the peaceful aspirations of the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, including the Japanese people, has already begun to have an impact in Japan, encouraging the Japanese people's will to strive for peace and independence, and will continue to have a huge and profound impact. At the time of the Peace Conference, the Japanese people had been closely paying attention to and concerned about the situation and progress of the Peace Conference. Japanese newspapers published a lot of news about the Peace Conference. Sometimes, newspapers were published and sold on the streets forty minutes after hearing reports from Beijing Radio. Because of this, the Yoshida government became even more panicked and intensified its persecution of Japanese peace representatives and peace-loving people in the country. However, the Japanese people's firm will to thoroughly implement the resolutions of the Peace Conference is obviously by no means something that any persecution and suppression measures by the Yoshida government and its American masters can stop. The despicable behavior of the Yoshida government in persecuting Japanese peace representatives and democratic organizations can only further expose its shameful and despicable face of hostility to peace and fear of peace.

### 和平会议的成就在日本产生巨大影响  吉田政府恐惧不安无耻迫害日本和平代表

    和平会议的成就在日本产生巨大影响
    吉田政府恐惧不安无耻迫害日本和平代表
    【新华社二十一日讯】在美国政府指示下积极复活军国主义的日本吉田政府，对于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的胜利成功在日本所产生的巨大影响，感到很大的恐惧和不安，现正采用进一步迫害出席和平会议的日本代表的卑鄙手段，来扼杀日本人民为彻底实现和平会议决议而进行的斗争。
    据悉，吉田政府已于十六日对参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的龟田东伍、小泽清、儿岛博基、福井骏平、中村玩右卫门、小仓金吉和金子健太等七位日本代表发出逮捕令。同时有一千名警察抄查亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议日本筹备委员会、全日本学生自治会总联合会、“前进座”剧团和上述代表们的住宅。日本共产党、全日本学生自治会总联合会和“前进座”剧团的代表们已于十六日向东京都警视厅、法务省及外务省坚决抗议警察的上述迫害行为。
    吉田政府在美国政府的指使下，曾使用拒发日本和平代表出国护照并指使特务暴徒加以殴打的无耻手段，阻挠和禁止日本和平代表出席和平会议。它幻想这样就能破坏和平会议的召开和成功。东京“观察家”曾于九月二十四日洋洋得意地说：“由于日本政府拒绝把护照发给参加会议的六十名日本代表，这一着使会议在开始时就丧失一些宣传价值。”（法新社东京九月二十四日电）但是，以松本治一郎的代表中村玩右卫门为首的十三名日本和平代表，终于突破吉田政府的种种阻挠，克服重重困难，到达北京，并且参加了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。据共同社说，吉田政府表现出了“颇有慌张失措的神气”。吉田政府的这种慌张失措是不难理解的，因为它终于未能制止日本人民的代表在和平会议中向亚洲、太平洋和全世界人民控诉美国占领者及日本反动派的罪恶，申诉日本人民要求独立、民主、自由、和平的意愿和决心。
    尤其使吉田政府感到恐慌的是：亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民，通过和平会议向日本人民伸出了友谊的手，并作出了符合日本人民的意愿的关于日本问题的决议和其他决议。共同社东京十三日电承认：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议“将要发挥重要的作用”。日本资产阶级报纸“朝日新闻”十三日也不得不认为：“不能看轻有三十七个国家的代表参加的北京会议（按指亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议）的意义。这个会议对亚洲是极其重要的。”
    事实是代表包括日本人民在内的亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的和平意愿而召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，在日本已经开始产生影响，鼓舞着日本人民争取和平与独立的意志，并且将继续产生巨大而深刻的影响。在和平会议举行的时候，日本人民一直都在密切地注意和关心和平会议的情况和进展。日本报纸都用很大的篇幅登载有关和平会议的消息。有时，报纸在收听到北京电台的报道以后四十分钟就出版并在街上被叫卖了。正因为如此，吉田政府就更加恐慌起来，加紧迫害日本和平代表和爱好和平的国内人民。但是日本人民要求彻底实现和平会议决议的坚决意志，显然决不是吉田政府及其美国主子的任何迫害和镇压措施所能制止的。吉田政府迫害日本和平代表和民主团体的卑鄙行为，只能更加暴露它敌视和平与害怕和平的可耻且可鄙的面目。
