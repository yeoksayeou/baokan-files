    Judicial reform movements have been launched across the country. The five agencies of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Group (including the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate) have also deeply engaged in the ideological struggle against old legal views. After key reviews and extensive exposure and criticism, it has been proven that many comrades in the five agencies have adhered to the people's legal views in the implementation of business principles and policies, but some comrades also have strong old legal views. Only through this mass cleansing has the class nature of the old legal views been recognized, and it has been realized that it is fundamentally incompatible with the Marxist-Leninist legal view. Now, old legal views have been universally rejected in the five agencies and have lost their market.

    In this ideological struggle against old legal views, the five agencies profoundly exposed and criticized the ugly face of the old legal views and their anti-people ideological essence. Before the struggle, some comrades often flaunted their years of "old legal career" and regarded themselves as "authorities" in the Chinese legal field. Deep in their minds was a kingdom of the old feudal landlord and comprador-bureaucrat-capitalist legal system, filled with all kinds of reactionary and decadent legal goods from past reactionary dynasties to Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang that oppressed the people. These goods were regarded by them as the orthodoxy of Chinese law and revered as the standard. They could not see or look down on the people's legal system, and they could not see or look down on their own laws created by the people from revolutionary struggles. They insisted that the people's China led by the working class had "no law to follow." What is the "law" they are talking about? No matter what they say verbally, it is essentially the Kuomintang's "Six Codes"! People with this view are blind to the people's law. They do not understand that the people's law can only be created in class struggle and after obtaining state power; they do not understand that whatever the nature of state power, there is the corresponding nature of law. They thought that old laws could be used to replace new laws, and that the laws of the reactionary ruling class used to oppress the people could be used to replace the revolutionary laws of the liberated people. They could not distinguish the principled boundary between the people's law and the reactionary law. The people seized power by revolutionary means and crushed the old rule, and the law representing the will of the reactionary ruling class must of course be abolished and cannot be inherited or copied. Lenin said that the new regime creates a new rule of law and a new order, and we do not recognize any laws of the reactionary regime. People with the above views do not understand this principle.

    People who stand on the old legal viewpoint say: "Criminal law has universality." The reason is: people's democratic countries have criminal law, and bourgeois countries also have criminal law. This kind of "supra-class" statement is essentially standing on a reactionary position. They regard the suppression adopted by the people's regime against counter-revolutionary criminals and the persecution of revolutionary people by the reactionary ruling class as things without any difference; they regard the revolutionary criminal law aimed at protecting the interests of the people and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and the reactionary criminal law aimed at protecting the reactionary ruling class as things without any difference. Therefore, in criminal law, they particularly emphasize the so-called "protection of personal rights" and "equality before the law." Based on this "theory," someone once argued that in the land reform, the peasants' just struggle against the landlords should not be "excessive," otherwise it would infringe upon the landlords' "personal rights." Of course, we stipulated in the Land Reform Law that peasants are not allowed to carry out arbitrary arrests, beatings, and killings of landlords. But this is only to ensure the orderly and smooth completion of the land reform, to achieve the elimination of the feudal landlord class and the liberation of the peasants; what is the similarity between this and the reactionary old legal view that stands on the position of the landlord class to prohibit the infringement of the landlord's "personal rights," obliterate the political goal of eliminating the landlord class, and make the landlord also receive "equal" treatment before the people's law?

    On the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, people with old legal views particularly emphasized the so-called "preparatory crimes" and "attempted crimes," and the so-called "statute of limitations." After the people seized power, it is necessary to implement severe suppression of the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements in order to protect and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship; but these people detach themselves from this political reality and the entire policy to talk about law in vain, advocating that counter-revolutionary criminal activities such as attempted riots or preparations for murder should not be punished, and cannot be punished. Isn't this obviously condoning and shielding counter-revolutionary elements? Their boundless advocacy of leniency towards counter-revolutionary elements, in Lenin's words, is cruelty to the people.

    On the issue of marriage, people with old legal views discriminate against women's equal and free rights, oppose women's property rights, and describe men marrying "concubines" as "contractual" relationships, treating women as commodities. This is precisely the decadent and reactionary view of the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, which is directly contrary to the spirit of the people's Marriage Law.

    When drafting a law, people with old legal views first consider the style and format of the law. They nag and nag and want to turn the people's law from wording to the entire form into the appearance of the old law. Therefore, some people did not hesitate to copy the old law when drafting certain regulations and rules, even copying entire articles and chapters. They simply do not know that what we want is a legal form that is popular, easy to understand, and can be mastered by the people; they do not even understand that the people's law is created by summarizing the struggle experience of the people.

    People with old legal views are very enthusiastic about the so-called "judicial independence" that is divorced from politics, as if they can exist independently from political struggle. Therefore, they do not want political leadership and "make independence" from politics. They do not understand that politics and law are the same thing, and they do not understand the principle that politics determines law and law serves politics.

    In short, in terms of position, viewpoint, and method, the old legal view is fundamentally incompatible with the Marxist-Leninist legal view.

    The Central Committee had already issued instructions on abolishing the old reactionary ruling class's rule of law and establishing a new people's rule of law. The instructions clearly pointed out that the Kuomintang's "Six Codes" and all its laws and decrees are not partially but fundamentally unacceptable because it "can only be a tool to protect the reactionary rule of landlords, compradors, and bureaucratic capitalists," and for the masses of the people it can only be "suppression and restraint." The Central Committee also educated us to constantly despise and criticize the Kuomintang's "Six Codes" and all other reactionary laws, decrees, and all reactionary laws and decrees of capitalist countries in Europe, America, and Japan; but people with old legal views regard these things as treasures and cite them everywhere, and of course, they do not even talk about learning and mastering the Marxist-Leninist view of the state and the law to educate and transform themselves. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the State Council's "Instructions on Strengthening the People's Judicial Work" clearly stipulate the abolition of the old law and the establishment of the new law. People with old legal views should earnestly examine whether they have implemented these instructions and regulations, and whether they have clearly distinguished the principled boundary between the new and old laws; after thorough examination and cleansing, they should establish a clear view of the people's rule of law, stand on the position of the people's revolution, and fight for the consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship, and fight for the highest interests of the vast majority of people. Only in this way can they become people's legal workers in name and in fact.

    必须彻底改革司法工作
    清算反人民的旧法观点
    叶澜
    司法改革运动，已在全国各地发动起来。中央政法合署五机关（包括最高人民法院、最高人民检察署）也深入地开展了反对旧法观点的思想斗争。经过重点检讨和广泛的揭发，批判，事实证明：在业务方针政策的执行上，五个机关中许多同志是坚持了人民的法律观点，但也有一些同志有着浓厚的旧法观点。这次经过群众性的清算，才认清了旧法观点的阶级本质，认识到它和马克思列宁主义的法律观根本不能相容。现在，旧法观点在五个机关里已经遭到普遍的唾弃，失掉了它的市场。
    五个机关在这次反对旧法观点的思想斗争中，深刻地揭露和批判了旧法观点的丑恶面貌和其反人民的思想本质。在开展斗争以前，有的同志时常以其多年的“旧法生涯”炫耀，自视为中国法律界的“权威”。在他们的思想深处，是一个封建地主和买办官僚资产阶级旧法法统的王国，里面充斥着历代反动王朝以至蒋介石国民党的各种压迫人民的反动腐朽的法律货色。这些货色被他们认作中国法律的正统，奉为圭臬。他们看不见也看不起人民的法统，看不见也看不起人民从革命斗争中创造出来的自己的法律。他们硬说工人阶级领导的人民的中国“无可司之法”。他们所说的“法”是什么呢？不管他们口头上怎么说，实质上就是国民党的“六法”！具有这种观点的人，在人民的法律面前是盲者。他们不懂得人民的法律只能在阶级斗争中创造，在取得国家政权以后来创造；不懂得有了什么性质的国家政权，就有什么性质的法律。他们以为可以用旧法代替新法，可以用反动统治阶级压迫人民的法律代替翻了身的人民的革命法律。他们划不清人民的法律和反动的法律之间的原则界限。人民用革命手段取得了政权，粉碎了旧的统治，代表反动统治阶级意志的法律当然也必须废除，而不能承袭或搬用。列宁说过新政权创造新法治、新秩序，我们不承认反动政权的任何法律。具有上述观点的人是不懂得这个原则的。
    站在旧法观点上的人们说：“刑法具有世界性。”理由是：人民民主国家有刑法，资产阶级国家也有刑法。这种“超阶级”的说法，实质上是站在反动立场上的。他们把人民政权对于反革命罪犯所采取的镇压和反动统治阶级对革命人民的迫害，看成毫无分别的事情；把目的在保护人民利益、巩固人民民主专政的革命刑法和目的在保护反动统治阶级的反动刑法，看成毫无区别的东西。因而在刑法中特别强调所谓“保护个人人身权利”，“法律面前人人平等”。以这种“理论”为依据，曾有人这样主张：在土地改革中，农民对地主的正义的斗争不能“过分”，否则就是侵犯了地主的“个人人身权利”。诚然，我们在土地改革法中曾经规定不许农民对地主实行乱捕、乱打、乱杀。但这只是为了保证土地改革有秩序地顺利完成，达到封建地主阶级的消灭和农民的解放；这和站在地主阶级立场禁止侵犯地主“个人人身权利”、抹杀消灭地主阶级的政治目标、使地主也在人民的法律面前得到“平等”待遇的反动的旧法观点有什么相同之处呢？
    在镇压反革命活动的问题上，具有旧法观点的人特别强调所谓“预备犯”和“未遂犯”，强调所谓“时效”。在人民取得政权以后，必须对反革命分子的破坏活动实行严厉的镇压，才能保护与巩固人民民主专政；但这些人却脱离开这个政治实际和整个政策来空谈法律，主张所谓暴动未遂或准备谋杀等反革命犯罪活动不应办罪，不能办罪，这不是极明显地在纵容和包庇反革命分子吗？他们这种对反革命分子宽大无边的主张，按列宁的说法，就是对人民的残忍。
    在婚姻问题上，具有旧法观点的人歧视妇女的平等自由权利，反对妇女的财产权利，把男人娶“小老婆”说成“契约”关系，把女人当成商品，这正是地主阶级和官僚资产阶级的腐朽反动的观点，这与人民的婚姻法的精神是直接相违背的。
    具有旧法观点的人在草拟一种法律时，首先考虑的是法律的体例、格式。他们呶呶不休地要把人民的法律从词句到整个形式都变成旧法律的样子。因此曾有人在草拟某些法规和条例时，不惜照抄旧法，甚至整条整章地抄袭。他们根本不知道我们所要的，是人民喜闻乐见的、容易看得懂并能掌握的法律形式；更不了解人民的法律是总结人民群众的斗争经验而创造的。
    具有旧法观点的人，非常热中于脱离政治的所谓“司法独立”，似乎他们是可以脱离政治斗争而独立存在的。因此他们不要政治领导，向政治“闹独立性”。他们不理解政治和法律是一回事，不理解政治决定法律和法律为政治服务的道理。
    总之，在立场、观点和方法上，旧法观点是和马克思列宁主义的法律观点根本不相容的。
    废除旧的反动统治阶级的法治，建立新的人民法治，中央早已有过指示。指示中明白指出，国民党的“六法全书”及其一切法律、法令，不是一部分而是根本要不得，因为它“只能是保护地主与买办官僚资产阶级反动统治的工具”，而对人民群众则只能是“镇压与束缚”。中央又教育我们，对国民党的“六法全书”及其他一切反动的法律、法令和欧美日本资本主义国家的一切反动的法律、法令经常地蔑视和批判；但具有旧法观点的人却是把这些东西奉为至宝，到处引用，当然更谈不到学习和掌握马克思列宁主义的国家观、法律观来教育改造自己了。人民政协共同纲领及政务院“关于加强人民司法工作的指示”中，对废除旧法、建立新法都规定得很明确，具有旧法观点的人应切实检查自己是否执行了这些指示和规定，是否划清了新旧法律的原则界限；经过彻底的检查与清算，树立明确的人民法治的观点，站到人民革命的立场上来，为人民民主专政的巩固而斗争，为最大多数人的最高利益而斗争。只有如此，才能使自己成为名符其实的人民法律工作者。
