How the Correct Design of Factory 6850 Was Achieved
    Wang Jingzhi

    Factory 6850 is the first newly built heavy machinery factory in our country. A portion of the project has now been completed and has partially started production. It is the first time in our country that such a large machine factory has been built. Based on our current design capabilities and experience, there are many difficulties in building such a factory. However, because thorough investigation and exploration work was carried out before the design, and careful consideration was given during the preliminary design with the help of Soviet experts, people with erroneous views were persuaded and their thinking was unified, so its design was relatively successful.

    The construction of the factory was decided at the First National Machinery Industry Conference in 1950. The conference also decided on the factory site near a certain steel center based on the country's supply of steel, iron, and coal. After the conference, the factory preparatory office invited domestic experts, professors, and technical workers related to the construction of heavy machinery factories to hold multiple investigation meetings, collected information on the product types, scale, operating processes, equipment specifications, labor conditions, etc. of heavy machinery factories, and investigated the labor supply, transportation, postal and telecommunications, astronomy, hydrology, and coal and electricity supply at the factory site.

    All the necessary design information was available. However, due to different viewpoints of the designers, two different design schemes for the factory scale and workshop layout were proposed, which caused fierce debates among the technical personnel.

    The first scheme stipulated that the factory's manufactured products should be various medium-heavy and heavier machines, such as metallurgical equipment, coal mining equipment, heavy construction equipment, heavy chemical equipment, and heavy-duty machine tools. According to this scheme, in terms of equipment, it was necessary to order various large-scale equipment, such as extra-large hydraulic presses, steam hammers, extra-large metal cutting machine tools, and in large quantities. Those who advocated this scheme believed that only by establishing such a large-scale factory could there be sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the country. At the same time, according to this scheme, in order for the factory to continue to develop in the future, considerable space should be left between the workshops (a distance of more than 150 meters should be maintained) for the addition of new construction.

    The second scheme stipulated that the factory should manufacture medium-heavy machinery, with not too many product types, and should mainly produce general industrial and mining machinery and equipment. Therefore, the factory equipment should be calculated according to a medium-heavy factory, the scale is not as large as the former, and therefore, in terms of factory layout, the distance between the workshops should not be too far.

    Why are there two design schemes with such different opinions? What are their reasons?

    Those who proposed the first design scheme only started from needs and development, regardless of technical possibilities and economic rationality. They believed that our country urgently needed heavy machinery, and the construction of the factory was a long-term plan for a hundred years, and should not be limited by realistic conditions. Therefore, the scale of the factory should rather be large than small, the product types should rather be many than few, and the product specifications should be as large as possible, so that in the future, with the needs of national economic development, it could manufacture any kind of machinery and equipment. Those who proposed the second scheme considered needs in conjunction with realistic conditions and development in conjunction with economic rationality. They believed that the heavy and large machinery and equipment currently needed could be temporarily imported from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. They have rich manufacturing experience and advanced technology, the quality of the manufactured products is good, and it is guaranteed to be usable after purchase. We should determine the factory scale, product types, and specifications according to our current technical conditions, and then build a factory that can manufacture heavy and extra-large machinery and equipment after we have gained experience in building factories and mastered production technology. Therefore, if the factory building is doubled now for the future development of the factory, it would also be uneconomical. Doubling it is not as good as building a new factory.

    As a result of the debate, those who advocated the first scheme prevailed. The preliminary design was determined. Those who advocated the first design scheme believed that the factory design had been carefully considered, and the designers were the top experts in the country. If there were still errors, it would be unavoidable. They requested immediate allocation of funds to purchase materials and organize construction. Those who insisted on the second design scheme advocated that construction should be organized only after Soviet experts have studied it.

    In the spring of 1951, Soviet expert Comrade Krimsky was invited to the construction site. He inspected the conditions of the factory site, studied various investigation materials, and understood the two design schemes. Based on the Soviet construction experience, he pointed out that several principles must be paid attention to in building a factory: First, it is impossible for a machine factory to manufacture all machines. Second, the scale, product types, and specifications of the factory must be determined according to realistic technical conditions. The reason is very simple: Designing a factory apart from the technical possibilities of construction and production not only increases the difficulty of building the factory, but even if the factory is built, there are no large numbers of workers who have mastered production technology to carry out production. Third, advanced technical norms must be adopted to consider the scale of the factory and workshops and the number of equipment. The equipment of each workshop must be balanced according to the quantity of products, so that the equipment capacity can be fully utilized and waste avoided. Fourth, the overall layout of the factory should not be too dispersed, because if it is too dispersed, the internal transportation lines of the factory will be prolonged and the transportation equipment will be increased, which not only increases the cost of building the factory, but also increases the operating time during future production due to the long transportation lines between the workshops, affecting the increase in output and the reduction in costs. At the same time, if the workshops are too dispersed, the utilization coefficient of the factory land will be reduced, wasting useful national land and increasing construction costs. This kind of frequent waste is the most uneconomical principle.

    Based on the above opinions, Comrade Krimsky and the designers re-studied for two weeks, re-determined the scale of the factory and the preliminary design, made the original scattered layout very compact, reduced the excessive and unnecessary equipment and factory building area, and changed the internal transportation system of the factory. This preliminary design is the guideline for the technical designs made in 1951 and 1952.

    Because the factory conducted sufficient research and absorbed the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and re-determined the overall layout and preliminary design, it ensured that no mistakes were made in the construction work.

    六八五○厂的正确设计是怎样得来的
    王敬之
    六八五○厂是我国新建的第一个重型机器厂，现在已经完成了一部分工程，并已部分开始生产。在我国，建设这样大的机器厂，还是第一次。根据我们现有的设计能力和经验来说，要建设这样一个工厂，有很多困难。但是，由于在设计前，作了周密的调查和勘察工作，在初步设计时，又在苏联专家的帮助下，作了慎重的考虑，说服了有错误观点的人，统一了思想，所以，它的设计是比较成功的。
    该厂是在一九五零年第一次全国机器工业会议上决定建设的，会议并根据国家的钢、铁、煤等供应情况，决定厂址在某钢铁中心的附近。会议以后，该厂筹备处即邀请了国内有关重型机器工厂建设的专家、教授和技术工人举行了多次的调查会议，搜集有关重型机器厂的产品品种、规模、操作过程、设备规格、劳动条件等资料，并调查了厂址所在地的劳动力供应、交通邮电、天文水文以及煤电的供应等资料。
    所需要的各种设计资料都有了。但由于设计人员的观点不同，提出了两种不同的工厂规模和车间布置的设计方案。并曾在技术人员中引起了激烈的争论。
    第一种方案，规定该厂的制造品为各种中重型以上的机器，如冶金装备、采煤设备、重型的建筑装备、重化工装备和重型工作母机等。根据这一方案，在设备方面，必须订购各种大型的设备，如特大型的水压机、汽锤、特大型金属切削机床，并且数量要多。主张这一方案的人，他们认为只有建立这样大规模的工厂，才能有充分的余力满足国家的需要。同时，根据这项方案，为了工厂将来不断发展，在车间之间就应留出相当大的空间（距离保持在一百五十公尺以上），以备增加新的建设。
    第二种方案，规定该厂制造中重型机器，产品种类不要太多，应以生产一般工矿的机器设备为主。因此，工厂设备应该按中重型工厂来核算，规模不如前者，因而厂房布置方面，各车间的距离也不要太远。
    为什么会产生两种意见相差很远的设计方案？他们的理由何在？
    提出第一种设计方案的人，只从需要和发展出发，不顾技术的可能性和经济的合理性。他们认为我们国家非常需要重型机器，该厂的建设又是百年大计，不应受现实条件的限制。因此，工厂的规模应该是宁大勿小，产品种类宁多勿少，产品规格越大越好，以便将来随着国家经济发展的需要，要什么机器设备它都可以制造。而提出第二种方案的人，则是结合着现实的条件来考虑需要，结合着经济的合理性来考虑发展。他们认为目前需要的重型和大型机器设备，暂时可以从苏联和人民民主国家输入，他们有丰富的制造经验和先进技术，制造品的质量好，买来后保证能用；我们应该根据我们目前的技术条件来确定工厂规模、产品种类和规格，等到取得建厂的经验和掌握了生产技术，再建设能制造重型和特大型的机器设备的工厂。因此，如果现在就为将来工厂的发展而将厂房扩大一倍，也是不经济的。扩大一倍就不如另建新厂。
    争论的结果，主张第一种方案的人占了优势。初步设计被确定了。主张第一种设计方案的人认为工厂的设计已经考虑成熟了，设计人员又都是国内第一流专家，如果还有错误，那也是无法避免的了。他们要求赶紧拨款购买材料，组织施工。而坚持第二种设计方案的人，则主张请苏联专家研究以后才组织施工。
    一九五一年春天，苏联专家克里姆斯基同志应邀来到工地。他考察了厂地的条件，研究了各种调查资料，又了解了两种设计方案，再根据苏联的建设经验，指出建设工厂必须注意几个原则：一、一个机器工厂是不可能制造所有的机器的。二、必须根据现实的技术条件来决定工厂的规模、产品种类和规格。道理很简单：脱离建设和生产的技术可能性去设计工厂，不仅增加建厂的困难，而且即使把工厂建设起来了，也没有能掌握生产技术的大批工人去进行生产。三、必须采用先进的技术定额来考虑工厂及车间的规模和设备的数量，各车间的设备必须按产品的数量来取得平衡，这样才能充分发挥设备能力，避免浪费。四、工厂总的布置不宜太分散，因为太分散了就会延长厂内的运输线，增加运输设备，这不仅增加建厂的费用，而且在将来生产时，由于车间与车间之间的运输线过长，增加作业时间，影响产量的提高和成本的降低。同时，车间太分散了，就降低工厂土地的利用系数，浪费国家有用的土地，增加建设费用。这种经常性的浪费，是最不合乎经济的原则的。
    根据以上的意见，克里姆斯基同志和设计人员重新研究了两个星期，重新确定工厂的规模和初步设计，把原来分散的布置改得很紧凑，把过多的和不必要的设备和厂房面积给以削减，改变了厂内运输系统。这个初步设计就是一九五一、一九五二年做的技术设计的准绳。
    由于该厂作了充分的研究和吸收苏联的先进经验，重新确定了总的布置图和初步设计，才保证了在建设工作中不犯错误。
