    The Korean people are very concerned and attentive to the development of the situation in Japan.
    The American ruling clique, realizing that it is impossible to invade all of Asia by relying solely on its own strength, wants to turn Japan into its own colony and military base, and use it as a gendarme to destroy the independence, freedom, and peace of the Asian people. Based on the illegally signed one-sided peace treaty with Japan and the "US-Japan Security Treaty," Japan is rapidly rearming itself with the support of the United States. This seriously threatens the independence, freedom, and peace of the people in the Asian and Pacific regions, including the Japanese people.
    For the Korean people today, the restoration of Japanese militarism has become a component of the American aggressors' war of aggression against Korea, aimed at destroying the independence and freedom of our motherland.
    American aggressors have already built more than 600 military bases and military facilities on Japanese territory. As a result, today, the unprecedented bestial bombing that has turned many peaceful cities and villages in Korea into desolate ruins, and the mass slaughter of our peaceful women, children, and elderly innocent residents, are almost all carried out from Japan as a base.
    The American aggressors also support Japan's military industry, and today, various bombs and lethal weapons, such as napalm bombs, used on the Korean front are mostly manufactured in Japan. Not only that, the American aggressors, in contempt of international law and human morality, hired Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals such as Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano in order to use bacteriological weapons to destroy mankind in Korea and Northeast China. In fact, many Japanese mercenaries and a large number of military supplies have long been mobilized to the Korean front.
    In the war of aggression against Korea, the American aggressors have not only directly used the Japanese in military terms in this way, but they are also frantically running around trying to get the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan and the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique of Korea to sign a so-called ROK-Japan military agreement. The American aggressors also forcibly compelled the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan to forcibly send 600,000 Korean compatriots residing in Japan under the control of the Syngman Rhee traitorous bandits. They deliberately create discord between the Japanese and Korean peoples, causing serious unease and threats to the lives of Koreans in Japan.
    These series of facts are some of the disasters currently directly suffered by the Korean people due to the restoration of Japanese militarism, and these cannot but be a signal of serious danger to other people in the Asian and Pacific regions who are not directly harmed now.
    We, the Korean people, lived under the unbearable slave life of oppression, exploitation, and slaughter under the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism for as long as thirty-six years. The great Chinese people have also suffered decades of shameful aggression. Moreover, at the end of Japanese imperialism, which people within the scope of their so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" had not suffered the barbaric aggression, plunder, and persecution of Japanese imperialism?
    Then, assuming that Japan, with the support of the American ruling clique, becomes the outpost for their aggression in Asia and restores itself to militarism, it is not difficult to imagine what its results will bring to the Japanese people and what it will bring to the people of the Asian and Pacific regions.
    Therefore, the struggle against the remilitarization of Japan is not only the task of the Japanese people, but also the common cause of all the people in the Asian and Pacific regions who long for independence, freedom, and peace.
    Therefore, on behalf of the Korean people who are directly harmed by the revival of Japanese militarism, I call on the people of the Asian and Pacific regions to unite as one and launch a resolute struggle to stop the revival of Japanese militarism. Precisely because of this, we must abolish the San Francisco separate peace treaty with Japan and all its accompanying aggressive treaties and agreements, which are aimed at turning Japan into an American colony and military base and reviving Japanese militarism; we demand: to immediately sign a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan with the consent of the countries participating in the war against Japan, in accordance with the principles of the Potsdam Agreement; withdraw foreign troops stationed in Japan; oppose providing any military bases and military facilities and any pretext for interference in internal affairs.
    Only in this way can Japan not be transformed into a colony subordinate to other countries, but become a democratic, autonomous, and independent country; only in this way can Japan not become a flashpoint for war in Asia, but play an important role in safeguarding peace.

    朝鲜代表团副团长郑圣彦关于日本
    问题的发言（摘要）
    朝鲜人民对于日本局势之发展，是非常关心和注意的。
    已经觉得单靠自己的力量是不可能侵略全体亚洲的美国统治集团，想把日本变为它自己的殖民地和军事基地，要利用它来做为毁灭亚洲人民的独立、自由与和平的宪兵。根据非法签订的片面对日和约和“美日安全条约”，日本在美国的扶植下，迅速地重新武装起来。这很严重地威胁着包括日本人民在内的亚洲及太平洋区域人民的独立、自由与和平。
    而对今天的朝鲜人民来说，日本军国主义的恢复已成了旨在毁灭我们祖国的独立、自由的美国侵略者们的侵朝战争的构成部分。
    美国侵略者在日本领土内已经建设了六百余处的军事基地和军事设施。其结果，今天把朝鲜的许许多多的和平城市和乡村变为荒凉的废墟，大量屠杀我们和平妇女、儿童和老年人等无辜居民的史无前例的兽性轰炸，差不多都是以日本为基地而进行的。
    美国侵略者还扶植了日本的军需工业，今天在朝鲜前线所使用着的凝固汽油弹等的各种炸弹和杀人武器，多半都在日本制造着。不仅止此，美国侵略者们蔑视国际法则和人类道德，为了在朝鲜和中国的东北使用毁灭人类的细菌武器，它们聘用了石井四郎、若松次郎和北野政藏等日本的细菌战犯。实际上，早就有很多的日本雇佣兵和大批的军需器材动员到朝鲜前线来了。
    美国侵略者们在侵略朝鲜的战争中，不但已经这样把日本人直接利用到军事上，他们还想使日本的吉田反动政府和朝鲜的卖国贼李承晚集团签订一个所谓韩、日军事协定而疯狂奔走着。美国侵略者还强使日本的吉田反动政府把侨居在日本的六十万朝鲜同胞，强迫遣送到李承晚卖国匪帮的支配之下。他们故意制造日本人民和朝鲜人民间的挑拨，使在日本的朝鲜人民受到生活上的严重的不安与威胁。
    这些一连串的事实，是由于日本军国主义的恢复，朝鲜人民目前所直接遭到的一些灾难，而这些对于现在不直接受害的亚洲及太平洋区域其他人民，也不能不是严重危险的信号。
    我们朝鲜人民曾在日本帝国主义的殖民地统治下，过了不可忍受的被压制、被剥削、被屠杀的奴隶生活，达三十六年之久。伟大的中国人民也曾遭受过数十年可耻的侵略。不仅如此，在日本帝国主义的末期，凡是在它们所制造的所谓“大东亚共荣圈”范围内的人民，那有不曾遭受过日本帝国主义的野蛮侵略、掠夺和迫害的呢？
    那末，假设日本在美国统治集团的扶植之下，成为它们侵略亚洲的前哨，再恢复成军国主义的话，它的结果，能给日本人民带来些什么，能给亚洲及太平洋区域人民带来些什么，就不难想像了。
    所以，反对日本重新军国主义化的斗争，不仅是日本人民的任务，也应该是渴望独立、自由与和平的全体亚洲及太平洋区域人民的共同事业。
    因此，我代表由于日本军国主义之复活而直接受害的朝鲜人民，号召亚洲及太平洋区域人民一致团结起来，为制止日本军国主义之复活而展开坚决的斗争。正因为这样，我们要废除旨在变日本为美国殖民地和军事基地、并复活日本军国主义而非法签订的旧金山单独对日和约及其一切附带的侵略性的条约和协定；我们要求：根据波茨坦协定的原则，在对日参战国的同意下，立即签订全面的对日和约；撤退驻日的外国军队；反对提供一切军事基地及军事设施与以任何藉口的内政干涉。
    只有这样，日本才能不变为隶属于他国的殖民地，而成为民主主义的自主独立国家；只有这样，日本才能不成为亚洲战争的起火点，而为保卫和平尽重要的作用。
