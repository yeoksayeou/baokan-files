Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The various units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army at the front held gatherings in various locations on the 24th to celebrate the great victories of the past two years of fighting abroad. At the commemorative meetings, all units solemnly read Commander Peng Dehuai's order issued to celebrate the second anniversary of the Volunteer Army's participation in the war. All commanders and combatants unanimously stated: We will resolutely carry out Commander Peng's order and fight to the end to achieve a fair and reasonable resolution of the Korean issue.
    Representatives of the various sub-delegations of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, which is conducting慰問 (comfort) activities in the front-line units, participated in the commemorative meetings of the Volunteer Army units. They represented the people of the motherland in extending congratulations and慰問 to the Volunteer Army, and reported on the achievements of the motherland's construction in various fields and the situation of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. They also read the congratulatory telegram from the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to the Volunteer Army at the commemorative meeting. The Volunteer Army commanders and combatants deeply thanked the people of the motherland for their love and support. Soldiers of a certain unit wrote more than a thousand letters in one day, asking the delegation to hand them over to the people of the motherland. They expressed to the people of the motherland that they will strive for more victories to repay the care of the people of the motherland.
    Party and government organs in various parts of Korea, the Korean people, and the local People's Army also sent representatives to participate in the commemorative meetings of the Volunteer Army units to extend their congratulations to the Volunteer Army. A delegation of Korean people from a certain place, participating in the commemorative meeting of a certain Volunteer Army unit in the central line, specially transferred the gifts from the Hungarian people to the Korean people—photos, handkerchiefs, soap, candy, cigarettes, biscuits, sewing needles, etc.—to the Volunteer Army soldiers. The Democratic Women's League of a certain place presented a bunch of plump ears of grain to a certain Volunteer Army unit on the eastern front. In their congratulatory message, they said:
    "Volunteer Army comrades not only fight at the front, but also help us with spring plowing, repairing canals, and transplanting rice seedlings, enabling us to obtain the largest harvest in thirteen years. The ears of grain we are presenting now are the fruits of our joint labor with the Volunteer Army comrades."
    On the positions jointly guarded by the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, the soldiers of the Volunteer Army and the People's Army held joyous and friendly get-together parties.
    Since October 14th, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies on the central front have annihilated more than 10,000 enemy troops in counterattacks. On the evening of the anniversary, a platoon of a certain Volunteer Army unit launched a counterattack against a enemy-occupied hilltop position near Fangping-ri, southeast of Kimhwa. The battle lasted for ten minutes, and the position was captured, completely annihilating a reinforced platoon of enemy troops. The brave soldiers at the front celebrated the glorious anniversary with new victories.
