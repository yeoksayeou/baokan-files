    Central Academy of Fine Arts Students Help with Art Propaganda Work in Fangshan Mine, Western Beijing
    Editor: Our art propaganda work at the Fangshan Mine in Western Beijing, though it had some foundation in the past, never really took off due to a lack of specific guidance. This year, in early July, seven students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, including Wen Lipeng and Leng Yanmei, came here and patiently helped us draw cartoons about safety, hygiene, and "finding shortcuts." This not only cultivated our creative abilities but also greatly promoted the patriotic production increase and economization movement in our mine (especially in safety education). After seeing the cartoons, the workers often said, "We must pay attention to safety regulations and not sleep underground!" This shows that the cartoons have profoundly educated everyone. In addition to guiding us in drawing cartoons and writing artistic characters every day, the students also taught us to sing and dance in the evenings. Therefore, in just one month, they established a deep friendship with the workers. Everyone said, "We will answer the students' help by doing a good job in the art propaganda work of the Fangshan Mine!"

    中央美术学院同学到京西房山矿帮助美术宣传工作
    编辑同志：我们京西房山矿的美术宣传工作，在过去虽然有些基础，但是由于缺乏具体的指导，总是开展不起来。今年七月初，中央美术学院闻立鹏、冷延梅等七位同学到这里，耐心地帮助我们画出了有关安全、卫生、“找窍门”等漫画。这样不但培养了我们的创作能力，并且对本矿的爱国增产节约运动起了很大的推动作用（特别是在安全教育方面）。工友们看了漫画以后常说：“可得重视保安规程，别在井下睡觉！”可见漫画已深刻地教育了大家。同学们每天除指导我们画漫画、写美术字以外，还在晚上教我们唱歌、跳舞。因此在短短的一个月中，他们和工友建立了深厚的友情，大家都这样说：“我们要以搞好房山矿的美术宣传工作，来回答同学们对我们的帮助！”
