    Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Army of the Romanian People's Republic
    Romania Sampeir
    On October 2nd, the working people of the Romanian People's Republic celebrate the founding day of the Romanian People's Republic Army with ardent and joyful hearts.
    The selection of October 2nd as a celebration day for this great people is of great significance. On October 2nd, 1943, J.V. Stalin agreed to establish on Soviet territory the First Romanian Volunteer Division to fight for the liberation of the motherland under Hitler's rule. This division is recorded in the history of the motherland under the name "Tudor Vladimirescu Division." The people of Romania, with deep gratitude, named the first unit of their People's Army after their dearest friend, Stalin.
    This division was organized and trained on Soviet soil. At home, the Romanian Communist Party, led by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, established the armed guards of patriotic workers. These guards were led by Bodnaras, now the Minister of the Armed Forces of the Romanian People's Republic.
    Under the favorable conditions created by the glorious Soviet army liberating Romania, the Romanian Communist Party, through the armed guards of patriotic workers, organized and completed the arrest of the fascist Antonescu traitorous government and eliminated the Hitlerite groups attempting to destroy the nation's capital. Simultaneously, the Party led and organized the struggle to turn weapons against Hitler's Germany. The fourteen Romanian divisions fighting on the Second Ukrainian Front fought alongside the Soviet army, crossed a thousand kilometers, and liberated more than three thousand eight hundred places, including fifty-three towns, in Transylvania, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. Marshal Stalin mentioned the Romanian army several times in his orders, and due to the results of the battle to liberate Debrecen, the "Tudor Vladimirescu Division" was awarded the Soviet "Red Banner Order" and named "Vladimirescu-Debrecen Division" by Marshal Stalin. Thus, together with the Soviet army and with its assistance, the Romanian soldiers recorded a glorious page in the history of their motherland.
    All the struggles made by the Romanian Communist Party to create the "Tudor Vladimirescu Division," to organize the armed guards of patriotic workers, and to mobilize the Romanian troops in the anti-Hitler war, provided the necessary conditions for the creation of a People's Army modeled on the Soviet army – the strongest army in the world. Since the end of 1947 (December 30th), when the last reactionary pillar, the Hohenzollern autocracy, was overthrown domestically and internationally, and the Romanian People's Republic was proclaimed, the entire Romanian army became a conscious and strong fighting force defending their own motherland and the peaceful construction of the working people.
    Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, speaking at the Romanian Workers' Party conference in February 1948 about the nature and tasks of the new army, said: "For our peaceful motherland and its people, this army, whose task is to strengthen the Romanian People's Republic, is the defender of our independence and sovereignty – the fortress of the interests of the Romanian People's Republic and its people, the school of the people – that is how we view the mission of the Romanian People's Republic Army."
    Since 1948, significant social and economic changes have taken place in the Romanian People's Republic: the main means of production have been nationalized, the socialization of agriculture has begun, and the main cornerstones of building socialism have been laid. The armed forces of the Romanian People's Republic are defending with firm and unwavering will the fruits of victory obtained by the builders of socialism in the Romanian People's Republic. That is why the new Constitution of the Romanian People's Republic stipulates: "Military service is compulsory. Serving in the armed forces of the Romanian People's Republic is the glorious duty of all the people of the Romanian People's Republic."
    The army of the Romanian People's Republic is composed of conscious citizens who enjoy all the rights conferred upon the working people by the constitution and actively participate in public life. It is an army in which all working people who participate in it, regardless of their ethnicity, enjoy equal rights, bear the same obligations, and are united in a common and boundless loyalty to their free country. Within the armed forces of the Romanian People's Republic, only the sons of the working people are qualified to serve in the military. This conscription system is one of the fundamental guarantees that the army unconditionally serves the interests of the working class and its allies and defends these interests. Therefore, the relationship between the combatants and commanders in the Romanian People's Army is like that of brothers. Soldiers, sergeants, and officers are united by common interests. This interest is the interest of the working people. They do their best to protect it. This is also one of the sources of the strength of the Romanian People's Army.
    This army is a school for the people, a school for creating new types of people.
    The entire personnel of the army are educated in the supreme traditional spirit of the people and in the struggle for the freedom and independence of the motherland. They will not forget the heroic deeds of the people who resisted the Turkish invaders for centuries. The immortal heroic images of the working class, such as Stefan Gheorghiu, Ilie Pintilie, Petre Ceaikovski, Bela Breiner... and others, are their powerful models. These heroes encourage them to love their motherland and encourage them to defend their motherland unremittingly and resist the enemy.
    The youth in the army are educated in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and in the respect and love for the cause of the struggle for the freedom and independence of all peoples. The soldiers of the Romanian People's Republic forces, closely linked to the working people, are educated in the spirit of love and infinite gratitude to the victorious socialist state, the Soviet Union, and to the leader beloved by all workers, J.V. Stalin. They thank and admire the revolutionary struggle of the great Chinese people and the victories won by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They love the long-tested leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the people and leaders of the fraternal people's democratic countries.
    The commanders and fighters of the armed forces of the Romanian People's Republic hate with all their strength the American and British imperialists and their heinous lackeys who attempt to re-enslave the people. For the common enemies of humanity who dare to infringe upon the freedom and independence of the people, the personnel of the armed forces of the Romanian People's Republic are determined to strike them relentlessly. In Romania, soldiers are admiringly watching the heroic struggle of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers against American and British imperialism. They know that this struggle is also a struggle to defend peace.
    The combat training of the army of the Romanian People's Republic is based on Soviet military art and science, the science of victory created by the great Stalin.
    The Romanian army, through the cultural activities that are being carried out in various units, is making a significant contribution to the cultural revolution of the motherland. The song and dance troupe of the Romanian People's Republic forces—which is now honored to perform before the Chinese people—helps to strengthen the patriotism and internationalism of the broad masses of soldiers of the Romanian People's Republic, and also helps the original folk art of the Romanian people and ethnic minorities to shine and become richer.
    The old army of the bourgeois landlord class was a tool for oppressing and exploiting the masses of the people and for corrupting the masses of soldiers who were forced into military service. The Romanian People's Republic Army has nothing in common with the old army. The Romanian People's Republic Army is the army of the people, because its task is to defend peace, defend socialist construction, and oppose imperialism; in terms of the class composition of its members, its commanders and soldiers are specially recruited from among the working people; it has the political education of socialist patriotism and proletarian internationalism; it has a profound dedication to the people and the socialist cause; and, it has military thought and organization under the influence of the great Stalin's military science.
    The Romanian people need peace and fight for peace. This strong will for peace is reflected in the creative efforts of the working people in socialist construction, reflected in the use of the vast majority of the national budget expenditure for huge peaceful construction and social and cultural undertakings, and reflected in the Romanian people's increasingly active participation in the various peace movements initiated by peace fighters around the world. The commanders and fighters of the armed forces of the Romanian People's Republic know that in the battle for peace, constantly strengthening the defense capabilities of their motherland is their best contribution.

    罗马尼亚人民共和国建军节
    罗马尼亚  萨姆彼尔
    十月二日，罗马尼亚人民共和国的劳动人民以热切愉快的心情来庆祝罗马尼亚人民共和国的建军节日。
    选择十月二日做为这个伟大人民的庆祝节日是具有重大意义的。在一九四三年十月二日，约·维·斯大林同意在苏维埃领土上建立一支为解放希特勒统制下的祖国而斗争的罗马尼亚的志愿军第一师。这一师，以“都德·府拉其米尔斯古师团”为名而记载在祖国的历史上。罗马尼亚的人民怀着深切的感激以其最亲爱的友人斯大林的名字命名其人民军队的第一支部队。
    在苏维埃的土地上组织了并且训练了这个师。在国内，乔治乌—德治领导的罗马尼亚共产党创立了爱国工人的武装警卫队。这些警卫队曾为现在罗马尼亚人民共和国武装部队部部长波德纳拉斯所领导。
    在光荣的苏联军队解放了罗马尼亚所创造的有利条件下，罗马尼亚共产党通过爱国工人的武装警卫队，组织了和完成了逮捕法西斯安东尼斯库卖国政府分子的工作，并且扫除了要想破坏国家首都的希特勒集团。同时，党领导了并组织了将武器转向希特勒德国的斗争。在第二乌克兰战线作战的十四个罗马尼亚师与苏维埃军队共同作战，跨过了一千公里，在德兰斯斐文尼亚、匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克，解放了三千八百多个地方，其中包括五十三个城镇。斯大林大元帅在其命令中曾几次的提到罗马尼亚的军队，由于解放德不来金城镇的战斗结果“都德·府拉其米尔斯古师团”曾荣获苏维埃“红旗勋章”，并被斯大林大元帅命名为“府拉其米尔斯古—德不来金师团”。就这样，与苏维埃的军队一起并在其援助之下，罗马尼亚的士兵在他们祖国的历史上记下了光荣的一页。
    罗马尼亚共产党为了创立“都德·府拉其米尔斯古师团”，为了组织爱国工人武装警卫队以及为了在反希特勒战争中动员罗马尼亚的队伍所作的一切斗争都供给了创立以苏维埃军队——世界上最强大的军队——为范例的人民军队的必要条件。自从一九四七年末（十二月三十日），国内及国际上最后一个反动支柱霍亨佐伦专制政权被推翻，罗马尼亚人民共和国宣告成立时，整个罗马尼亚军队便成为一支保卫他们自己祖国及劳动人民的和平建设的有觉悟的及坚强的战斗部队。
    乔治乌—德治同志在一九四八年二月罗马尼亚工人党会议上谈到新军队的性质及任务时说：“为了我们和平的祖国及其人民，这支以加强罗马尼亚人民共和国为自己任务的军队是我们独立及主权的保卫者——罗马尼亚人民共和国及其人民的利益的堡垒、人民的学校——我们便是这样地来看罗马尼亚人民共和国军队的使命的。”
    一九四八年以来，罗马尼亚人民共和国内发生了重大的社会及经济的变革：主要的生产手段都已国有化，农业的社会化也已开始，建立社会主义的主要基石都已树立。罗马尼亚人民共和国的武装部队正在以坚决及不可动摇的意志来保卫着罗马尼亚人民共和国内社会主义建设者所得到的胜利果实。这就是为什么罗马尼亚人民共和国新宪法上规定：“服兵役是强迫性的。在罗马尼亚人民共和国的武装部队里服兵役是罗马尼亚人民共和国全体人民的光荣职责。”
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的军队，是由有觉悟的享有一切宪法上赋予劳动人民的权利并积极参加公共生活的公民所组成的。它是这样的一支军队：凡参加这支军队的劳动人民，不问其种族如何，均享有同等权利，负有同样义务并团结在共同对他们的自由国家的无限忠诚里。在罗马尼亚人民共和国的武装部队内，只有劳动人民的儿子才配参军，这种征兵制度是军队无条件地为工人阶级及其同盟者的利益服务并保卫这种利益的基本保证之一。因此，在罗马尼亚人民军中的战斗员和指挥官之间关系，犹如兄弟。士兵，军曹，军官们因利益相同而结合在一起。这利益就是劳动人民的利益。他们尽全力来保卫它。这也是罗马尼亚人民军力量的源泉之一。
    这支军队是人民的学校，是创造新型人物的学校。
    军队的全体人员是在人民的至高无上的传统精神和为争取祖国的自由独立的斗争中教育出来的。他们不会遗忘几世纪来抵抗土耳其侵略者的人们的英勇事迹。工人阶级不朽的英雄形象，如：斯蒂芬·乔治，伊利·品梯利，配孚·蔡森柯，贝拉·布瑞纳尔……等人，都是他们有力的模范。这些英雄们鼓励他们热爱他们的祖国，并且鼓励他们毫不懈怠地保卫祖国与抵抗敌人。
    军队中的青年受到无产阶级国际主义精神的教育，受到对于为全体人民的自由和独立的斗争事业的尊敬与热爱的教育。与劳动人民紧密联系的罗马尼亚人民共和国部队的士兵们受到对胜利的社会主义国家苏联及对全体工人所爱戴的领袖约·维·斯大林的热爱和无限感激的精神的教育。他们感谢和钦佩伟大的中国人民的革命斗争与中国人民解放军所获得的胜利，他们热爱中国人民久经锻炼的领袖毛泽东主席及人民民主兄弟国家的人民和领袖。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的武装部队的指挥员与战士们以全付力量憎恨那些企图重新奴役人民的美英帝国主义者及其万恶的走狗们。对于敢于侵犯人民自由与独立的人类公敌，罗马尼亚人民共和国的武装部队人员坚决予以无情的打击。在罗马尼亚，士兵们正敬佩地注视着朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军反对美英帝国主义的英勇斗争。他们知道，这个斗争同时也就是保卫和平的斗争。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国军队的战斗训练是以苏维埃军事艺术与科学为基础的，那是伟大的斯大林所创造的胜利的科学。
    罗马尼亚军队，通过在各个部队中正在进行着的文化活动，对祖国的文化革命，作了重大的贡献。罗马尼亚人民共和国部队歌舞团——就是现在以在中国人民之前演出为光荣的歌舞团——帮助加强了罗马尼亚人民共和国广大士兵们的爱国主义和国际主义精神，同样也帮助了罗马尼亚人民和少数民族原有的人民艺术，使它放射光芒，益臻丰富。
    资产阶级地主阶级政权的旧军队是压迫和剥削人民群众的工具，是使被迫当兵的士兵群众堕落的工具。罗马尼亚人民共和国军队则与旧军队无丝毫共同之处。罗马尼亚人民共和国军队是人民的军队，因为它的任务是保卫和平，保卫社会主义建设，反对帝国主义；从成员的阶级成分来讲，它的指挥员和士兵们是特地从劳动人民中间征召起来的；它有社会主义爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义精神的政治教育；它对于人民和社会主义事业有深邃的献身精神；而且，它具有在伟大的斯大林军事科学影响下的军事思想和组织。
    罗马尼亚人民需要和平，并为和平而战斗。这种强有力的和平意志，反映在劳动人民为社会主义建设而作的创造性的努力，反映在把国家预算开支中的绝大部分用之于巨大的和平建设和社会文化事业，和反映在罗马尼亚人民愈来愈积极地参加全世界和平战士发起的历次和平运动。罗马尼亚人民共和国武装部队的指挥员、战士们都知道在争取和平的战斗中，不断地加强他们祖国的国防力量就是他们最好的贡献。
