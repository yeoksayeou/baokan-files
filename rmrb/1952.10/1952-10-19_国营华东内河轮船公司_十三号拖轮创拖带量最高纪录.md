No. 13 Tugboat Sets Highest Towing Record

    The workers of the state-owned East China Inland River Shipping Company's No. 13 tugboat successfully learned from the advanced experience of Soviet ships, the "single-row towing method," and created a national record of averaging 14.07 tons towed per horsepower.
    In the past year, the No. 13 tugboat has worked hard to learn from the advanced Soviet experience of the "single-row towing method," overcoming conservative thinking such as "the average towing capacity per horsepower should not exceed four tons," and continuously increasing the towing capacity. On August 20, the ship set a record of averaging 12.88 tons towed per horsepower on the Wuxi to Shanghai route. Afterwards, they summarized their experience and, on August 28, created a new national record of averaging 14.07 tons towed per horsepower, while ensuring safe navigation. This time, they towed eleven wooden boats with a total load of 656.5 tons, an average speed of 5.05 kilometers per hour, and coal consumption reduced by 7.46 kilograms per hour compared to the quota. The main methods they used to increase towing power were to reduce water resistance. For example, keeping the eleven wooden boats in a straight line while sailing; arranging the smaller wooden boats in the front row when forming the convoy; loading more goods in the stern of the boat during loading to raise the bow, and so on. In addition, the stoker adding coal evenly, and the drivers paying attention to utilizing the water flow in the航道 (navigation channel), also played a big role. (Xinhua News Agency)

    十三号拖轮创拖带量最高纪录
    国营华东内河轮船公司十三号拖轮的职工，学习苏联轮船的先进经验“一列式拖带法”成功，创造了每匹马力平均拖带十四点零七吨的全国最高纪录。
    最近一年来，十三号拖轮努力学习了苏联先进经验“一列式拖带法”，克服了“每匹马力平均拖带量不得超过四吨”等保守思想，不断提高拖带量。八月二十日，该轮在从无锡至上海的航线上，便创造了每匹马力平均拖带十二点八八吨的纪录。事后他们总结了经验，又在八月二十八日创造了每匹马力平均拖带十四点零七吨的全国新纪录，并且保证了航行安全。这一次共拖带了木船十一艘，总载重达六百五十六吨半，航速每小时平均五点零五公里，烧煤每小时较定额减少了七点四六公斤。他们增加拖带力量的主要方法，是设法减少水的阻力。如在行驶时，使十一条木船保持成一条直线；在编列时，把小木船排放在前列；在装货时，船尾部分多装货物，使船头升高等等。另外，司炉加煤时均匀，驾驶人员等留心利用航道中的水流，也起了很大作用。    （新华社）
