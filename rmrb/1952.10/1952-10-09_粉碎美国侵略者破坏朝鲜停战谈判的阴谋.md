    The Korean armistice talks, which are of deep concern to people all over the world, held another plenary session on October 8. In order to advance the negotiations and stop the Korean War, our side put forward a fair and reasonable new proposal that accepted some of the U.S. side's opinions. However, the U.S. side stubbornly and unreasonably refused to discuss it, openly opposed the world's people's desire for peace, and announced an indefinite adjournment of the Korean armistice talks. Thus, the U.S. side's deliberate conspiracy to oppose international conventions and international practice, to sabotage the negotiations in order to plunge the world's people into a major war threat, and to refuse consultation and resolutely implement its war will with cruel violence, was exposed by their tyrannical actions. Peace-loving people all over the world will undoubtedly recognize the ferocious faces of a small handful of American imperialists and will unite more closely to strengthen their enormous efforts to fight for peace.
    As everyone knows, after the U.S. side put forward so-called three different suggestions on September 28, it requested a ten-day recess. The U.S. side's three suggestions were, in essence, completely permeated with the unreasonable demand to forcibly detain prisoners of war, and in each proposal, it advocated that prisoners of war who "oppose repatriation" should not be repatriated to their homes to live peaceful lives. This completely violates the Geneva Convention and Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement that both sides have already agreed upon. The purpose of the U.S. proposal is to attempt to cover up the substance of detaining prisoners of war with formal minor changes, deceive the people of the world, and use this to escape responsibility for delaying the negotiations. Therefore, the three suggestions of the American aggressors are completely unacceptable.
    However, in order to end the Korean War and to satisfy the world's people's desire for a Korean armistice as soon as possible, our side adopted the formal changes in the U.S. proposal at the October 8 meeting based on the principle that both sides should release and repatriate all prisoners of war, that is, all prisoners of war should first be sent to the demilitarized zone to be taken over by the other side to complete the initial release procedures, instead of implementing immediate and complete repatriation. Our side also proposed that after the prisoners of war have been handed over to the side to which they belong, Red Cross teams from both sides could visit them to promote and explain the principle of guaranteeing that prisoners of war will no longer participate in the Korean War after being repatriated, so that they can return home to live peaceful lives. In order to further dispel the U.S. side's concerns, our side made further reasonable efforts, stipulating in the proposal that when the two sides taking over the prisoners of war conduct visits to the prisoners of war and classify and repatriate them according to the principles of nationality and region, neutral country inspection teams must be present to observe. People all over the world will see at a glance that our new proposal is another major effort by our side to strive for an armistice and to strive for peace. If negotiations are conducted on the basis of this proposal to discuss methods, a Korean armistice can be achieved quickly.
    People all over the world eagerly await the realization of a Korean armistice. The American people are burdened with the heavy burden of the aggressive war, and their desire for peace and an armistice is particularly deep. This is a fact revealed by the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference. However, the American aggressors have gone their own way, completely ignoring the peaceful demands of the people of the world, including the American people, turning a blind eye to our side's efforts, and resolutely refusing to negotiate, announcing an indefinite adjournment to threaten and disrupt the negotiations. Just when the people of the world could see the prospect of the flames of war being extinguished and the bloodshed ending, the American imperialists took such an openly hostile action against their heartfelt wishes, which is absolutely intolerable to the people of the world. American imperialists must bear serious responsibility for the barbaric crime of delaying and disrupting the Korean armistice talks.
    The Geneva Convention is a solemn international law for dealing with the issue of prisoners of war. It is the mature crystallization of the wisdom and established rules of mankind regarding the handling of prisoners of war over hundreds of years. It is an important international norm for ending wars and restoring peace, and is observed and implemented by countries all over the world. The United States government personally participated in the formulation of this convention and signed it. They have repeatedly declared that they abide by this convention. However, on the entire issue of prisoners of war in the Korean War, the American aggressors have, from beginning to end, in terms of murdering, abusing, and insulting prisoners of war, forging prisoners of war's signatures and fingerprints, refusing to issue prisoners of war rations, forcing prisoners of war to perform dangerous labor, discriminating against and persecuting prisoners of war due to political beliefs, and so on, violated all the important provisions of the Geneva Convention. In particular, they insisted on detaining prisoners of war and openly took action to unilaterally "release" more than 20,000 of our captured personnel, handing them over to the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. At the time of this handover, Van Fleet, the direct commander of the U.S. forces invading Korea, openly violated Article 52 of the draft armistice agreement regarding guaranteeing that prisoners of war would not participate in the Korean War, ordering these captured personnel of our side to join the Syngman Rhee bandit army and "fight together" with the bandit army against the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. These barbaric assertions and actions of the American aggressors completely abandoned the solemn international obligations imposed on them by the sacred Geneva Convention. They violently tore up Article 118, Article 7, and Article 21 of this convention. We know that the provisions of all international charters are intended to reduce international disputes and safeguard peace, and the Geneva Convention was precisely formulated to end wars and restore peace. If this universally recognized international charter can be allowed to be arbitrarily torn up by a small number of monopoly capitalists in one country because they want to persist in war to continue extracting huge profits, then the legal foundation of international relations will be completely destroyed, and peace will be under greater threat. Indeed, Hitler and the Japanese militarist Tojo once relied on tearing up international treaties to plunge the people of the world into war. However, the people who have experienced World War II are already highly aware and highly vigilant people. We absolutely cannot allow such heinous acts to succeed again.
    The entire basis of the American imperialists' so-called voluntary repatriation is built on the Hitler-esque shameless lies of so-called prisoners of war refusing repatriation, so-called prisoners of war preferring collective suicide to returning home to live peaceful lives. They say that the reason they have to do this is for the sake of humanity and individual rights. However, our captured personnel on Geoje Island risked the bloody massacres by the U.S. side to oppose the aggressors' so-called screening and to fight for their individual right to demand complete repatriation. Our captured personnel on Jeju Island, especially our volunteer army captured personnel in the 3A prisoner of war camp on Jeju Island's Mogeunpo, where the U.S. side supposedly detains "Chinese prisoners who cooperate against communism," disregarded the U.S. side's planned massacre and insisted on celebrating our great motherland's National Day on October 1 to express their love for the motherland and their individual will to demand to go home. Our captured personnel who were forced by the enemy to become airborne spies risked their lives to throw grenades into the aircraft cabin to destroy the enemy aircraft, demonstrating their hatred for the enemy and their longing for the motherland. On Geoje Island, on Jeju Island, in Busan, Masan, Nonsan, and in all places and locations where the U.S. side detains our captured personnel, our captured personnel's bloody struggle against American imperialists, revolving around opposing screening, opposing detention, and fighting for the individual right of all prisoners of war to be repatriated home, unfolded extensively with one falling and another following. They are by no means preferring collective suicide to repatriation. On the contrary, they are risking the unprecedentedly brutal collective massacre by the U.S. invading army to insist on repatriation. This is a great epic written in their own blood by prisoners of war throughout history who have resisted violence and insisted on their rights. Faced with the heroic struggle of our captured personnel who are protecting their sacred rights, the American invading army murderers are at a loss. They used all kinds of weapons used against powerful enemies on the battlefield, including tanks, poison gas, machine guns, grenades, etc., to suppress our captured personnel with brutally unparalleled massacres, attempting to destroy their individual will and deprive them of their individual right to demand repatriation home. These are all iron facts personally admitted by Colson, the former commander of the American prisoner of war camp. According to reports from British and American news agencies alone, since February of this year, more than 1,000 of our captured personnel have been sacrificed, and according to reports from escapees from our captured personnel, the number of those sacrificed is already five to six thousand. Can people not clearly see here that the American imperialists' so-called "humanity" is a demonic path of exterminating humanity, and their so-called individual rights are the power of destroying individual rights?
    From the American aggressors' behavior of destroying peaceful Korean towns and peaceful residents with large-scale bombing using so-called military pressure in order to detain prisoners of war, and from their cruel behavior of detaining the youths of seventeen countries on the Korean battlefield, causing them to suffer huge casualties of 20,000 to 30,000 people per month in order to detain prisoners of war, people can see a ferocious fact, that is, the American imperialists are determined to implement their will to detain prisoners of war with cruel violence. The entire history of mankind tells us that it is precisely this behavior of exterminating humanity, destroying individual rights, and believing in violence that has constantly led to wars, causing endless great disasters to mankind. However, history has reached today, when the forces of peace have risen infinitely and imperialism is weakening day by day. The American imperialists' violent propositions of exterminating humanity, destroying the individual rights of prisoners of war, and destroying the peaceful lives of the people have never gained any advantage in the past, and will only suffer greater failures in the future.
    Now, people can see that after suffering major failures in launching the Korean War of aggression, the American imperialists, although forced to sit at the negotiating table to negotiate an armistice, are actually still pursuing military interests that cannot be obtained from the war. They once demanded that the military demarcation line be drawn within 12,000 square kilometers of the territory of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and once demanded that military personnel be sent to inspect the rear areas of Korea after the armistice and demanded to interfere in the internal affairs of Korea by restricting the repair and construction of airports by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. After these and many other aggressive demands of theirs were defeated, they insisted on detaining our prisoners of war in order to so-called prevent our side from obtaining "unfair military advantages," sending them to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to serve as cannon fodder, in order to prepare for their plan to expand the war. They still occupy our Taiwan, and their air force increasingly frequently invades our airspace to bomb and strafe and kill and injure our people. They have engaged in various unreasonable provocative actions against our country. These facts all show the American aggressors' sinister conspiracy to pursue the expansion of the war in the negotiations.
    Now, they are openly refusing to consult, refusing to negotiate, and using the indefinite adjournment of the negotiations to make shameful, repeatedly failing threats against our side, hoping to use this to achieve their military objectives of detaining prisoners of war, and attempting to expand the war.
    The well-trained people of Korea and China, who defeated the American aggressors in the Korean War, will never be intimidated by any threats from the American imperialists. We will continue to adhere to negotiations, resolutely fight to safeguard the dignity of the Geneva Convention, and fight to win the individual right of all prisoners of war to be repatriated home to live peaceful lives. Our cause is a just cause of peace. Our interests are the common interests of the people of the world. We firmly believe that peace-loving people all over the world will work together with us to fight to the end to crush the American imperialists' war conspiracy to sabotage the negotiations in Korea and to win a Korean armistice.

### 粉碎美国侵略者破坏朝鲜停战谈判的阴谋

    粉碎美国侵略者破坏朝鲜停战谈判的阴谋
    全世界人民所深切关心的朝鲜停战谈判，在十月八日又开了一次大会。我方为了推进谈判以便停止朝鲜战争，特提出一个公平合理的并接受了美方部分意见的新提案，但美方却蛮横无理地拒绝加以讨论，并公然与世界人民的和平愿望为敌，宣布朝鲜停战谈判无限期休会。至此，美方蓄意与国际公约和国际惯例为敌，蓄意破坏谈判以陷世界人民于重大的战争威胁之中，并蓄意拒绝协商、决心以残酷暴力来贯彻其战争意志的毒辣阴谋，就由于他们的这一横暴行动而大白于世。全世界爱好和平人民必将因此更加认清美国一小撮帝国主义者的狰狞面目而更加团结一致，加强为和平而斗争的巨大努力。
    众所周知，美方于九月二十八日提出了所谓的三个不同的建议之后，曾要求休会十天。美方的三个建议在实质上完全是贯穿着强迫扣留战俘的无理要求，在每一个提案中都主张所谓“反对遣返”的战俘不予遣返回家过和平生活。这完全是违背日内瓦公约和双方已经协议了的停战协定草案第五十一第五十二两款的。美方提案的目的是企图以形式上的微小变动来掩盖其扣留战俘的实质，欺骗世界人民，并借此逃脱其拖延谈判的责任。因此，美国侵略者的三个建议是完全不能接受的。
    但是，我方为了结束朝鲜战争，以便早日满足世界人民对朝鲜停战的渴望，在十月八日的大会上根据双方应释放和遣返全部战俘的原则，采纳了美方提案中形式上的变动，即将全部战俘首先送至非军事区交由对方接管以完成初步的释放手续，而不实行立即全部遣返。我方并提出在战俘已经交与所属一方接管后，可由双方红十字会小组对之进行访问，来宣扬和解释保证战俘被遣返后不再参加朝鲜战争，以便他们回家过和平生活的原则。我方为了进一步解除美方的顾虑更作了合理的努力，在提案中规定在接管战俘的双方对战俘进行访问和按照国籍地区分类原则来进行分类和遣返时，须由中立国视察小组在场观察。全世界人民一眼就会看清，我们的这个新提案是我方为了争取停战，争取和平的又一次重大努力。如果在这个提案的基础上，来就方法上进行协商，朝鲜停战是可以迅速实现的。
    全世界人民都迫切地期待着朝鲜停战的实现，美国人民身荷侵略战争的沉重负担，他们要求停战的和平愿望尤为深切，这是亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议所表露的事实。可是美国侵略者竟一意孤行，完全漠视世界人民，包括美国人民的和平要求，对我方的努力视而不见，并断然拒绝协商，宣布无限期休会，以破坏谈判来进行威胁。正当全世界人民可以望见战火熄灭、流血终止的前景的时候，美帝国主义者竟对他们的衷心愿望采取如此公开的敌对行动，这是全世界人民所绝对不能容忍的。美帝国主义者必须对拖延并破坏朝鲜停战谈判的蛮横罪行负严重的责任。
    日内瓦公约是处理战俘问题的庄严国际法规，是数百年来人类关于处理战俘问题所发挥的智慧和所形成的规律的成熟结晶。它是结束战争、恢复和平的重要国际准则，为全世界各国所遵守奉行。美国政府亲自参加制定这一公约，并且在这一公约上签了字。他们曾经多次宣称他们是遵守这一公约的。但是，在朝鲜战争中的整个战俘问题上，美国侵略者却自始至终，在屠杀、虐待和侮辱战俘，伪造战俘签字和指纹等方面，在拒发战俘口粮，强迫战俘服危险劳役，因政治信仰歧视并迫害战俘等等方面，全部违背了日内瓦公约的所有重要条文。特别是他们坚持要扣留战俘，并且公然采取行动，片面“释放”了两万以上的我方被俘人员，把他们交给李承晚匪帮。在这样交送的时候，美国侵朝军的直接指挥官范佛里特竟公然违反停战协定草案第五十二款关于保证战俘不参加朝鲜战争的规定，命令我方这些被俘人员参加李承晚匪军并和匪军来“一道抗击”朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。美国侵略者的这些蛮横主张和行动彻底背弃了神圣的日内瓦公约所加之于他们的庄严国际义务，他们横暴地撕毁了这一公约的第一百一十八条，第七条和第二十一条。我们知道：一切国际约章的规定就是为了减少国际纠纷，保障和平，而日内瓦公约又恰恰是为了结束战争，恢复和平而制定的。如果这种举世公认的国际约章能够听由一个国家的少数垄断资本家因为要坚持战争来继续榨取庞大利润而把它任意撕毁，那么，国际关系的法律基础就要完全破坏，和平就要受到更大的威胁。诚然，希特勒和日本军国主义者东条是曾经倚靠撕毁国际条约而把全世界人民投入了战争的。但是，经过了第二次世界大战的人民已经是具有高度觉悟和高度警惕的人民，我们绝对不能容许这样的罪恶行为再度得逞。
    美帝国主义所谓自愿遣返的全部基础，建筑在所谓战俘拒绝遣返，所谓战俘宁愿集体自杀，不愿回家过和平生活的希特勒式的无耻谎言上面。他们说他们之所以要这样做，是为了人道和个人权利。可是我方在巨济岛上的被俘人员却冒着美方的血腥屠杀，来反对侵略者的所谓甄别，来争取他们要求全部遣返的个人权利。我方在济州岛上的被俘人员，特别是在济州岛上慕琴浦美方所谓拘留“合作反共的中国俘虏”的三A战俘营中的我志愿军被俘人员，不顾美方有准备的大屠杀计划，坚持在十月一日庆祝我们伟大祖国的国庆节日，以此来表达他们对祖国的热爱和要求回家的个人意志。我方被敌强迫去当空降特务的被俘人员冒着自己的生命危险，把手榴弹掷在飞机舱内来毁灭敌机，以示他对敌人的仇恨和对祖国的向慕。在巨济岛，在济州岛，在釜山、马山、论山，在所有美方拘留我被俘人员的地方和场所，我方被俘人员对美帝国主义者的血腥的斗争环绕着反对甄别、反对扣留、为争取全部战俘遣返回家的个人权利而前仆后继地广泛展开。他们决不是宁愿集体自杀而不愿遣返，正相反，他们是在冒着美国侵略军空前残暴的集体屠杀来坚持遣返。这是有史以来战俘为了反抗暴力、坚持本身权利而用自己的鲜血写下来的伟大史诗。美国侵略军杀人犯面对我被俘人员这种为了保护自己的神圣权利而进行的壮烈斗争，手足无措。他们使用了各种对待战场上的强大敌手的武器，包括坦克、毒气、机关枪、手榴弹等等，以残暴绝伦的大屠杀来镇压我方被俘人员，企图以此来摧毁他们的个人意志，剥夺他们要求遣返回家的个人权利，而这些都是美国前战俘营长官柯尔生亲笔承认了的铁的事实。仅仅据英美通讯社的报道，自今年二月以来，我被俘人员遭受牺牲的已经是一千余人，而根据我被俘人员逃出者的报告则牺牲者已经有五六千人。人们在这里难道还看不清楚美帝国主义者所谓的“人道”是灭绝人道的魔道，他们所谓的个人权利是摧毁个人权利的强权么？
    从美国侵略者为了扣留战俘而用所谓军事压力的大规模轰炸来毁灭朝鲜和平城镇与和平居民的行为中，从他们为了扣留战俘而将十七个国家的青年人们扣留在朝鲜战场上，使他们遭受每月二三万人的巨大伤亡的残酷行为中，人们可以看到一个狰狞的事实，那就是美帝国主义者决心要用残酷暴力来贯彻他们的扣留战俘的意志。整个人类历史告诉我们，就是这种灭绝人道、摧毁个人权利、迷信暴力的行为在不断地导致战争，使人类遭受不绝的巨大灾难。但是历史已经走到了和平力量无限高涨、帝国主义日就衰弱的今天，美帝国主义者这种灭绝人道、摧毁战俘个人权利、毁灭人民和平生活的暴力主张在过去从来不曾讨得任何便宜，在今后也只有遭受更大的失败。
    现在，人们可以看清，美帝国主义者在其发动朝鲜侵略战争遭受了重大失败之后，虽然是被迫坐在谈判桌上在谈判停战，但实际上他们还是在追求从战争中所得不到的军事利益。他们曾经要求把军事分界线划在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一万二千方公里的领土之内，曾经要求在停战后派遣军事人员来朝鲜的后方地区进行视察并要求以限制朝鲜民主主义人民共和国修理和建筑机场来干涉朝鲜的内政。在他们的这些以及其他许多侵略要求被击退了之后，他们就为了所谓不使我方得到“不公平的军事利益”而坚持要扣留我方战俘，把他们送交李承晚蒋介石匪帮充当炮灰，以为其扩大战争的计划预作准备。他们至今强占我国台湾，他们的空军日益频繁地侵入我国领空轰炸扫射并杀伤我国人民。他们对我国进行各种无理的挑衅行动。这些事实都说明美国侵略者在谈判中追求扩大战争的罪恶阴谋。
    现在，他们竟公然拒绝协商，拒绝谈判，并以破坏谈判的无限期休会来对我方进行可耻的、屡试屡败的威胁，希图借此来达到他们扣留战俘的军事目的，并企图扩大战争。
    久经锻炼的、并在朝鲜战争中击败了美国侵略者的朝中两国人民是决不会为美帝国主义者的任何威胁所吓倒的。我们将继续坚持谈判，坚决为维护日内瓦公约的尊严而斗争，为争取全部战俘遣返回家过和平生活的个人权利而斗争。我们的事业是正义的和平的事业。我们的利益是全世界人民的共同利益。我们坚决相信全世界爱好和平人民将和我们一道共同努力，为在朝鲜粉碎美帝国主义者破坏谈判的战争阴谋，赢得朝鲜停战而奋斗到底。
