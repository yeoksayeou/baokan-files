    [Reported by this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: American Communist Party National Committee Chairman Foster published an essay in the New York "Daily Worker" on October 3, denouncing the "Jeju Island Massacre." Foster said: "The overall political-military goal behind the Jeju Island massacre is to try to create a situation that leads to the breakdown of the Panmunjom armistice negotiations. This is part of a broad warmongering plan by American leaders in Korea. This plan includes: treating prisoners of war in a manner that North Korea and China cannot accept unless they virtually surrender; intensifying attacks by the army, navy, and air force; insisting on increasingly long interruptions in peace negotiations; and systematically creating an atmosphere of pessimism and despair about the negotiations in order to lay the groundwork for them to simply stop the negotiations later."
    Foster warned that by that time, they would be able to use the failure of the armistice negotiations as an excuse at the upcoming United Nations conference to get the U.S.'s aggressive war plans approved.
    Foster called on the peace forces in the United States to step up the campaign for a Korean armistice now and to organize a strong peace movement to continue the struggle after the election.
    Another dispatch: The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the front page on the 3rd, entitled "We Demand a Verdict." The editorial began by saying, "The crimes committed by American murderers on Jeju Island against the Chinese prisoners in their care are among the most despicable of crimes." The editorial said: "The victims are prisoners of war, who are entitled to all the treatment and protection stipulated by international conventions. The slaughter of prisoners of war is a violation of conventions that the United States should abide by. They have even committed atrocities that even the Nazis and Japanese fascists were afraid to commit. During the last war, British and American prisoners of war were never massacred when celebrating their own national holidays. The fact is that the American aggressors in Korea are afraid of something they don't understand, and they are frightened by this fear. They are beside themselves and in a state of panic because they are faced with a spirit. This is the spirit of free people, and their will to defend the freedom they have gained cannot be suppressed."
    Belgium's "Red Flag" published an article on the front page on October 2 entitled "New Crimes Against Humanity Committed in Korea." The article stated: "The barbarity of the American occupation forces in South Korea seems to have no end. The crimes they have recently committed surpass in scale all the previous massacres they carried out on Geoje Island." The article went on to say that this once again shows that the U.S. side's lies about these prisoners refusing repatriation are self-contradictory. "Red Flag" said: "Thus, who can still have a little bit of faith in the 'humanitarian' lies boasted by Washington to conceal its policy of obstructing the Panmunjom negotiations?"
    France's "L'Humanité" published news of the U.S. military's massacre of prisoners on Jeju Island on the front page on October 2, and wrote: The U.S. side's continuous slaughter of prisoners of war on Jeju Island and Geoje Island has made it increasingly clear to the world that the Chinese and Korean prisoners are demonstrating in practice that they are loyal to their motherland, and the U.S. military's slaughter of them is an attempt to obstruct this loyal expression, but it has failed.

    美国共产党主席福斯特著文
    指出美方屠杀战俘目的在于破坏停战谈判
    英比法等国进步舆论一致抗议美国屠杀战俘的暴行
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特于十月三日在纽约“工人日报”上发表论文，痛斥“济州岛的屠杀”。福斯特说：“济州岛屠杀的幕后的总的政治—军事目的，是想设法制造一种导致板门店停战谈判破裂的情况。这是在朝鲜的美国首脑们广泛的好战计划的一部分。这个计划包括：以一种使北朝鲜和中国除非实际上屈膝否则根本不能接受的态度对待战俘问题；加紧海陆空三军的进攻；坚持越来越长的和平谈判的中断时间；有计划地制造关于谈判的悲观和绝望的气氛，以便为他们日后干脆停止谈判奠定基础。”
    福斯特警告说：到那个时候，他们就能在即将举行的联合国会议上以停战谈判失败为藉口而使美国的侵略战争计划得以批准。
    福斯特号召美国的和平力量现在加紧进行争取朝鲜停战的运动，并且组织强大的和平运动在选举结束以后继续进行斗争。
    又讯：伦敦“工人日报”三日以首页刊载社论，题为“我们要求给予裁判”。社论开头说，“美国杀人犯在济州岛对他们照管的中国俘虏所犯的罪行要算是罪行中最卑鄙的了。”社论说：“受害者是战俘，他们有权享受国际公约所规定的一切待遇和保护。屠杀战俘就是破坏美国理应遵守的公约。他们竟然干出了纳粹以至日本法西斯分子都有所忌惮的残暴行为。在上次战争中，英美战俘在庆祝他们自己国家的节日的时候也从没有遭到过屠杀。事实是：朝鲜的美国侵略者害怕一种他们所不了解的东西，他们为这种恐惧吓倒了。他们六神无主，他们陷于惊悸不定之中，因为他们面对着一种精神。这是自由人民的精神，他们要保卫他们已经获得的自由的意志是压制不了的。”
    比利时的“红旗报”十月二日在第一版上发表题为“在朝鲜对人类干出来的新罪行”的文章。文章说道：“南朝鲜境内美国占领军的野蛮行为似乎是没有止境的。他最近干出来的罪行在规模上超过了他们以前在巨济岛上进行的一切屠杀。”该文接着说：这件事再一次说明美方所说的这些俘虏拒绝遣返的谎言是自相矛盾的。“红旗报”说：“这样，谁还能有一点点相信华盛顿为了掩饰其阻挠板门店谈判的政策而夸耀的‘人道’的假话呢？”
    法国的“人道报”十月二日在第一版刊载了美军屠杀济州岛俘虏的消息，并且写道：美方不断在济州岛与巨济岛屠杀战俘，使全世界日益明白中国和朝鲜俘虏正在以实际行动表明他们是忠实于他们的祖国的，美军屠杀他们是企图阻挠这种忠实的表示，但是失败了。
