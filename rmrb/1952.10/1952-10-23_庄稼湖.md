    "Crop Lake"
    By Our Correspondent Bai Yuan
    If you don't know what kind of disasters the Huai River floods once brought to the people on both banks of the Huai River, it is best to go outside Zhengyangguan in the middle reaches of the Huai River to take a look. To the west and southwest of Zhengyangguan, one lake connects to another, joining the Huai River west of Zhengyangguan to form a vast expanse of water. Underneath those lakes were originally flat fields. It has been fourteen years since the floods of 1938 submerged this area of land. Now, standing on the newly built embankment outside Zhengyangguan, you can still see the submerged villages in the distance. In those villages, there is nothing but one or two isolated houses and a few collapsed walls. Turning away from that vast expanse of water, across an embankment, to the southeast of Zhengyangguan, there are two connected lakes, one is Chengdong Lake of Zhengyangguan, and the other is Wangjia Lake. These two lakes used to be like the lakes on the other side, perpetually overflowing with a vast expanse of water. After the harnessing of the Huai River, the People's Government plans to control these lakes one by one: building embankments along the lake shores, constructing sluice gates, first draining the entire lake water, re-cultivating the past submerged fields, and when a large flood breaks out in the Huai River basin, and the Huai River cannot accommodate such a large amount of water, then, in a planned and controlled manner, release a portion of the water into the lake, and after the flood passes, drain the water out again. In this way, the fields in the lake will not be flooded year after year. Now, the two lakes we see have been growing crops since last year. A long drainage channel runs through the center of the lake. The crops fill the lake, just like the lake water, with no end in sight. In the harnessed Huai River basin, there are many such lakes. After draining the water from the lakes, and through people's cultivation, crops grow out of the lakes. People call such lakes "Crop Lakes".
    About three or four li south of Zhengyangguan, on the shore of these two lakes, there is a village called Mengwan Village. This village was not originally in this location. Standing on the Huai River embankment, looking towards the southwest of Zhengyangguan, about seven or eight li away, in that vast expanse of water, there are a few trees. Under the trees, you can vaguely see collapsed earthen walls. That is the former Mengwan Village. Fourteen years ago, the flood submerged that place. The people of Mengwan Village scattered and fled. It was not until last year, after the water of Chengdong Lake and Wangjia Lake in Zhengyangguan was drained, that the people of Mengwan Village, who had been wandering in various places, gradually returned to their hometown. However, not all the original people of Mengwan Village returned. After more than ten years of life's changes, some people had already settled down elsewhere; some families, due to the pressures of life before liberation, had lost contact with their relatives during their wandering, and now they could not be found; some who did not return had already died in unknown foreign lands. There was a fifty-year-old man named Meng Zhaoke who, during the great flood of 1938, left his hometown with his old mother, wife, and two young children. During the days of wandering, his old mother and one child starved to death outside; his wife also dispersed under the pressure of life; another daughter was given away because he could not afford to raise her. Meng Zhaoke returned to the current Mengwan Village alone. After the people returned, the government first allowed them to cultivate a portion of the land in Chengdong Lake and Wangjia Lake that had already been drained, and helped them rebuild their homes by the lake. Then, the government led the people of Mengwan Village to carry out land reform. During the land reform, the government workers encountered a special difficulty: because the entire project of harnessing the Huai River had not yet been completed, the lake water around the original Mengwan Village had not yet been drained. How should the survey and registration of those underwater lands be carried out, and how should the land rights of each field be determined? However, the peasants said: Even if it sinks to the bottom of the sea, we remember those fields, how big and how wide each one is; from the sweat we shed, we know which piece of land should belong to which owner. Thus, under the actions of the masses, the government led the peasants of Mengwan Village to complete the land reform and allocate land to the peasants.
    In these days of rebuilding their lives, people's lives were very difficult. In the beginning, when they first returned here, they had nothing but their hands. They built small thatched sheds by the lake to live in, bought livestock and farm tools with government loans, and began to plow and cultivate in the dried-up lake. In the original lake bottom, there was a thick layer of silt. When the seeds were scattered into it, the crops grew without fertilizer. But at the same time, as the water in the lake dried up, many reeds also grew everywhere. People cut down the reeds that grew out of the ground and turned the roots over from the soil, but when they looked the next morning, patches of reeds sprouted from underground again. People cultivated while fighting those reeds, and only after many days of hard work did they reclaim this land. After the people of Mengwan Village obtained the first year's harvest last year, they first slowly laid a good foundation for their lives. They expanded those small thatched sheds and built many houses. Now, beside those houses, the sunflowers planted by the people have blossomed and seeded. On the lake shore, full of crops, the cattle released from the village are quietly eating grass. Several newly bought lambs are tied under an earthen embankment at the edge of the village. They run up and down there, sometimes standing on the embankment and silently gazing at the lake full of crops, marveling at the changes in this human life.
    That day I walked along the Huai River embankment to this village. Under a small thatched shed at the edge of the village, several farmers from the village were sitting together. "What are you doing here?" I said. A farmer of about fifty or sixty years old answered me: "Not doing anything. When we have time, we sit together." Later they told me: Since the year when the flood occurred in their hometown, everyone fled to the outside, and no one thought they would be able to come back and gather together. At this moment, a child who looked only eleven or twelve years old ran over from that field of crops, holding a fish more than half a foot long in both hands, shouting as he ran. "Where did you catch the fish?" I asked the farmers sitting in the shed. They told me that after the water in the lake dried up, in those small depressions, as long as you scoop a jar into the water, you can scoop out a jar of fish. Hearing the child's shouting, a very young girl came out of a house, wearing a brand new student uniform. Behind her was another child. This young girl's name is Meng Lisheng. The one who caught a fish and ran from the field was her younger brother, named Meng Xianhuai. The one following behind Meng Lisheng was a child from another family, named Huo Shan. The people in the shed told me that it was because of fleeing that Huo Shan was born a child. Meng Lisheng saw us, ignored her younger brother, and walked towards the shed. Meng Xianhuai and Huo Shan, on the other hand, were excitedly talking about the fish as they ran into the village. The people in the shed introduced me, saying that Meng Lisheng is a member of the Youth League in this village (there are only three Youth League members in this village now), and during the land reform, she led the masses in the village and resolutely fought against the landlords. Now, in the village, for the sake of the masses, she often works from day to night without rest. The people in the shed also told me: Mentioning Meng Lisheng's family's past escape, she is still sad now. From the people's conversation, I learned that Meng Xianhuai was actually seventeen years old, but because the family often had nothing to eat when they fled outside, he only grew to be about eleven or twelve years old. I turned my head to look at the nineteen-year-old Meng Lisheng, who also only looked like fourteen or fifteen years old. I asked Meng Lisheng to tell me about her family's situation when they fled outside. She said: "At that time, I followed my mother to work in the landlord's house. My mother cooked, washed clothes, and hulled rice for others,... I looked after children for others,..." I saw that she was speaking so difficultly, so I changed the topic. "Where was this uniform made?" I asked her, looking at the student uniform she was wearing. "My uncle made it."
    "Where does your uncle live?" "More than ten li away from here, he also only returned last year after escaping." "When you came back, what did your uncle say when he saw you?" "He said, I didn't expect you to still be alive,... in the future, we must follow Chairman Mao,... and produce well." At this time, Meng Lisheng raised her head, with tears that she could not suppress in her eyes.
    Leaving that small thatched shed, I walked with Meng Lisheng towards the village. Not far away was her house. I asked Meng Lisheng: "Who is at home?" Meng Lisheng saw that I wanted to go in, stopped beside her house, smiled, and gently said to me: "Don't go in, my mother just gave birth to a younger brother at home." We slowed our steps and walked past the door of her house. In that half-closed door, the sunlight shining in from outside the house quietly spread on the ground. Her mother was lying on her side on the bed against the wall, with the swaddled child lying flat beside her with his little face turned up, as if he had just been fed not long ago. Now, both mother and child were sleeping contentedly and without worries. After passing Meng Lisheng's house, in a courtyard, a thirteen or fourteen-year-old child and his father were making adobe bricks, preparing to build a house. I saw the father and son working tirelessly in the sun, and I didn't dare to disturb them, so I followed Meng Lisheng to another farmer's house, where I sat for a while. When I came out, a golden sunset was floating over the lake full of crops. A flock of returning swallows flew past the newly built roof ridge, gently strumming the human smoke that was rising again on this land with their wings.

    “庄稼湖”
    本报记者　白原
    如果你不知道淮河的洪水曾经给淮河两岸的人民带来怎样的灾难，最好到淮河中游的正阳关外面去看看。在正阳关的西边和西南边，一个湖泊接着
    一个湖泊，和正阳关西面的淮河结在一起，连成了一片茫茫的大水。在那些湖泊底下，原来都是一片平坦的田地。自从一九三八年洪水把这一片田地淹没，已经十四年了。现在站在正阳关外面那一道新筑的堤岸上，远远地还可以望见那些被水淹没的乡村。在那些乡村里，除了一两间孤零零的房屋和几堵坍塌的墙垣，什么也没有了。从那一片茫茫的大水的方向掉过头来，隔着一道堤岸，在正阳关的东南方，这边还有两个连接起来的湖泊，一个是正阳关的城东湖，一个是王家湖。这两个湖原来也和那边的湖一样，终年漫溢着一片茫茫的湖水。治理淮河以后，人民政府计划要把这些湖泊一个个地控制起来：在湖边修筑堤岸，建造水闸，首先把整个湖水排干，将过去被淹没的田地重新开辟出来，遇到淮河流域暴发大洪水，淮河不能容纳这样的大水的时候，然后再有计划、有节制地放一部分水到湖里去，待洪水一过，就又把水排出来。这样，湖里的田地也就不会年年被水淹没了。现在，我们所看见的这两个湖，从去年开始，就是这样长起庄稼来了。一条长长的排水的渠道从湖中心穿过。满湖的庄稼，就如同那满湖的湖水一样，看不到边缘。在治理以后的淮河流域，有不少这样的湖泊，将湖里的水排干以后，经过人们的耕种，就从湖里长起庄稼来。人们把这样的湖叫做“庄稼湖”。
    距正阳关以南约三、四里地，在这两个湖的湖边上，有一个村子叫孟湾村。过去这个村子并不是在这个地方。站在淮河的河堤上，朝着正阳关的西南方望过去，距这里大约七、八里，在那一片茫茫的大水里有几棵树木，在树底下隐隐约约地可以看见坍塌的土墙，那就是过去的孟湾村。十四年以前，大水淹没了那个地方。孟湾村的人民四散逃亡。直到去年，正阳关城东湖和王家湖的湖水排干了以后，飘流在各个地方的孟湾村的人民才陆续地回到了故乡。但是，回来的并不是孟湾村原来的全部的人们。经过了十几年的生活的变迁，有一些人已经在外面安了家；有一些家庭在解放以前，因为生活的逼迫，在飘流中散失了的亲人现在都找不着了；有一些没有回来的人则早已死在没有人知道的异乡。有一个五十多岁的孟照科，一九三八年大水时带着自己的老母亲、妻子以及两个小孩子离开了家乡。在飘流的日子里，老母亲和一个小孩子饿死在外面；妻子也在生活的逼迫下离散了；另一个女孩子因为无法抚养，给了人家。剩下孟照科一个人回到了现在的孟湾村。人们回来以后，政府首先把已经排干了水的城东湖和王家湖的一部分土地让他们耕种，并帮助他们在湖边重建他们的家园。接着，政府又领导孟家湾村的人民进行土地改革。土地改革中，政府的工作人员曾经碰到一种特殊的困难：因为治理淮河的全部工程还没有完成，原来的孟家湾村周围那一片湖水还没有排干。对于那些水底下的土地，怎样来进行调查、登记，怎样来确定每一块田地的地权呢？但是，农民们说：那怕它沉到了大海里去，我们也记得那些田地，每
    一块有多大、多宽；从我们所流过的汗水，我们知道那一块土地应该属于那一个主人。于是，在群众的行动下，政府领导孟家湾村的农民完成了土地改革，给农民分配了土地。
    在这些重建生活的日子里，人们的生活曾经是很艰难的。开始的时候，他们刚刚回到这里，除了双手，什么也没有。他们在湖边搭起一些小小的草棚子住下来，用政府的贷款买了牲口和农具，就在已经干了的湖里犁耕起来。在原来的湖底，积着一层厚厚的淤泥，把种籽撒到里面去，不用上粪，庄稼就长起来了。但同时，湖里的水一干，许多的芦苇也到处长了起来。人们把长出地面的芦苇砍掉，把根从土地里翻过来，但第二天早晨一看，一片一片的芦苇又从地底下冒出来了。人们一面耕种，一面和那些芦苇作斗争，经过了许多日子的辛苦的经营，才把这一片土地开辟了出来。孟家湾村的人民在去年获得了第一年的丰收以后，首先就慢慢地将生活的基础打好。他们将那些小小的草棚扩充起来，建筑了许多的房子。现在，在那些房子旁边，人们所种植的向日葵已经开了花、结了籽。在那长满庄稼的湖边，从村子里放出来的牛静静地吃着青草。几只才买来的小羊羔被拴在村边的一个土坎下面。它们在那里上上下下地奔跑着，有时候站在土坎上面朝着那满湖的庄稼默默地张望，惊奇地看着这人间的生活的变迁。
    那一天我沿着淮河的堤岸走到这个村子里去。在村边的一个小小的草棚子下面，几个村里的农民坐在一起。“你们在这里干什么？”我说。一个五、六十岁的农民回答我：“不干什么。有功夫，大家在一起坐坐。”后来他们告诉我：自从家乡发生大水那一年，大家逃难到外面去，谁也没有想到还能够回来聚在一起。正在这个时候，一个看来只有十
    一、二岁的小孩从那一片庄稼地里跑过来，双手捧着一条半尺多长的鱼，一边跑着一边在叫嚷。“在那里捉的鱼？”我问那些坐在棚子里的农民。他们对我说，湖里的水干了以后，在那些小小的洼地里，只要把一个罐子往水里一捞，就可以捞出一罐子鱼来。听见了那个小孩的叫嚷，从一家房子里走出来一个很年轻的姑娘，穿着一身崭新的学生装。在她的后面，还跟着另一个小孩。这个年轻姑娘叫孟丽生。捉了一条鱼从地里跑过来的是她的弟弟，叫孟宪怀。跟在孟丽生后面的则是另一家的一个小孩子，名字叫霍山。棚子里的人们告诉我，那是因为逃难，在霍山生的一个小孩。孟丽生看见我们，没有理会她的弟弟，就向棚子里走来了。孟宪怀和霍山两个则兴致勃勃地一边谈说着关于那条鱼的事情，一边跑进了村子里去。棚子里的人们向我介绍，说孟丽生是这个村子的青年团员（在这个村子里，现在只有三个青年团员），在进行土地改革的时候，在村子里领导群众，坚决地向地主作了斗争，现在在村子里，为了群众的事情，常常从白天工作到深夜也不休息。棚子里的人们还对我说：提起孟丽生一家人过去逃难的事情，现在她还难过。从人们的谈话里，我才知道孟宪怀原来已经十七岁了，因为过去逃难在外面，一家人常常没有吃的，所以到现在才长得像十一、二岁这么大。我掉头来看一看十九岁的孟丽生，长得也只像是十四、五岁的样子。我请孟丽生把她们一家人在外面逃难时的情形告诉我。她说：“那时候我跟着母亲在地主家里做活。母亲给人家做饭、洗衣服、舂米，……我给人家看孩子，……”我看见她说得那么艰难，于是改变了话题。“这是在那里做的衣服？”我望着她身上穿的那一套学生装问她。“舅舅给做的。”
    “舅舅住在那里？”“离这里十几里地，也是去年才逃难回来。”“你们回来的时候，舅舅见了你们说些什么？”“他说，想不到你们还活着，……今后要跟着毛主席，……好好生产。”这时候，孟丽生把她的头抬起来，两只眼睛里带着抑止不住的眼泪。
    离开了那个小草棚子，我和孟丽生一起往村子里走去，不远，就是她家的房子。我问孟丽生：“谁在家里？”孟丽生看见我想要进去，在她们家的房子旁边停住脚步，微笑着轻轻地对我说：“不要进去，我母亲在家里才生过小弟弟。”我们放轻脚步，从她家的门口走过去。在那一扇半掩着的房门里，从房子外面照进去的阳光静静地铺在地上。在靠壁的床上侧身躺着她的母亲，包裹着的小孩仰着小脸平平地躺在她的身旁，仿佛喂过了奶才不久。现在，母子两个人都满足地、没有挂虑地睡着了。走过孟丽生家的房子，在一个场子里，一个十三、四岁的小孩子和他的父亲在那里打土坯，准备盖房子。我看见他们父子两个在太阳下不停地忙碌着，不敢打扰他们，就跟着孟丽生走到了另外一个农民的家里去，在那里坐了好一会。出来的时候，在那长满庄稼的湖上已经浮泛着一片金色的斜阳。一群归家的燕子从那新盖起来的屋脊上面飞过去，用它们的翅膀轻轻地拨弄着那些重新在这土地上升起来的、人间的炊烟。
