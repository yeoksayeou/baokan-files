    Envoys of the Motherland's People
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhou Zemin, Lin Lin
    As the heroic days of the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers going abroad to fight are approaching, the second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, composed of more than a thousand people and carrying the concern and respect of 475 million people for the heroic Chinese and Korean troops and the Korean people, has gloriously arrived at the Korean front.
    The scale of the delegation is unprecedented. The delegates are a great concentration of outstanding people from all over the country: there are representatives of various democratic parties headed by the Communist Party of China; there are representatives of various brotherly ethnic groups such as Han, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Miao, Yi, Yao, Korean, Uyghur, Kazakh, Tatar, and overseas Chinese returning from abroad; there are representatives of workers, peasants, the People's Liberation Army, students, youth, women, cultural workers, journalists, industrialists, businessmen, and religious circles.
    The representatives converged from various cities and villages of the motherland, from the borders and southeastern coasts of the motherland, and from various different work posts. Among them are Cui Zairen, a representative of the People's Liberation Army engineering corps and a builder of the border area in the western border of the motherland, at the northern foot of the Tianshan Mountains, more than 5,000 meters above sea level; Xia Bao, a representative of herdsmen from the Qinghai grassland; Baden, a Tibetan representative from Danba, Xikang; Chen Lifu, a combat hero of the People's Liberation Army Navy from the southeast coastal defense line; Kong Xiangming, a representative of the air defense force from the sacred national gateway, the Yalu River; and Chen Yangzeng, a representative of overseas Chinese who recently returned from abroad. Geographically, our motherland—especially the border regions of the southwest and northwest—is so far away from the Korean front, but as the representatives who traveled thousands of miles over mountains and rivers said: "Through thousands of clouds and mountains, our hearts are always flying to the front, embracing the heroes."
    In the delegation, there are outstanding labor models from various construction fronts; there is the famous industrial labor model Ma Hengchang; there is the agricultural labor model Zeng Guangfu; there is the Northwest automobile driving model Wang Xianzhang who travels in the border desert areas; there is the industrial model Qian Jiaguang who actively studied and improved several machines and was promoted from an ordinary worker to deputy factory director; there is Yang Jiahua, a famous seventeen-year-old advanced group model roving worker of the Chen Shulan group; there is Yi Jidong, the village chief of Wangmang Village, an agricultural high-yield model village in the Northwest; there is He Dahai, a youth representative from Chongqing 101 Steel Plant who completed the task of manufacturing steel rails for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway ahead of schedule; and there is Liu Yonghui, a worker representative who built the Tianlan Railway. In addition, the delegation also includes Dong Quanzhong, the father of martyr Dong Cunrui, a representative of the families of model martyrs, and Zhang Benzhou, the father of Zhang Jihui, a combat hero of the Volunteer Air Force and a model military dependent.
    In the delegation, there are also famous Peking Opera actors Ye Shenglan and Du Jinfang; Pingju opera actress Xiao Bai Yushuang; Shandong Kuaishu storyteller Gao Yuanjun; patriotic actress Chang Xiangyu; film actors Jin Yan and Zhao Dan; as well as the literary and art work troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and literary and art work teams from East China, North China, Northeast China, Northwest China, Southwest China, and Central South China.
    These are the best representatives sent by the Chinese people. It is these representatives who will bring to the front the hearts of hundreds of millions of people, more precious than any gift.
    When the news of the Chinese people organizing the second delegation to Korea spread in various cities, villages, mountains, and seas, from the border areas to the central cities, from institutions to families, with what deep feelings did people entrust their representatives to bring lofty care and respect to the front! The peasants of Wangmang Village said to their representative Yi Jidong: "You know how much we miss our most beloved people! We miss them during the New Year and festivals; we care about them in wind and rain; we are grateful to them when we see the thriving crops; and we think of them when we put on new clothes. Taking advantage of your opportunity to go, please give them our best regards!" Workers and peasants in many places have put forward plans to increase production and support the front to the representatives. A peasant woman in the Southwest carried her baby on her back and braved the rain to send the nineteen-year-old female representative Zhang Lirong to Korea, repeatedly urging her:
    "We will definitely complete the patriotic high-yield plan in your place. Go and comfort our relatives well! Bring back and tell us more of their heroic stories!" Musa Rouzi, a Uyghur farmer in Xinjiang, held Asaide's hand tightly when he saw their representative Asaide off, saying:
    "I really want to go with you to comfort the most beloved people. I hope you represent the Uyghur people, especially me, Musa Rouzi, to express my highest respect to the dearest people. You should shake hands tightly with the Volunteers and the People's Army, just like I am shaking hands with you now, and bring my love to them. You must understand what they need and like the most, and tell me when you come back. I will definitely support them with all my strength and try to meet their needs..." As he said this, he shed tears of excitement.
    The Chinese people have chosen the most meaningful gifts and entrusted the representatives to bring them to the front to give to the heroes standing at the forefront of defending world peace and the security of the motherland.
    Among the gifts, we can see the things that the commanders and fighters of the Volunteers are most concerned about: various books, pictorials, and pictures describing the great achievements of the motherland in construction over the past three years. Among them are a complete set of photos of "The Great Motherland"; a complete set of photos of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway from the beginning of construction to its early opening; a written report on the opening of the Northwest Tianlan Railway eight months ahead of schedule; and pictures of the construction of the Kangzang Plateau, the development of production, and the Huai River project over the past two years, as well as the progress of New China...
    Among the consolation items, the most numerous are large quantities of finely made towels, handkerchiefs, enamel cups, pipes, commemorative albums, stationery, envelopes, cigarettes, candies, and some ivory chopsticks, silver chopsticks, and Fenjiu wine. Each consolation item has language with deep affection. The white enamel cup is sprayed with the red words "Presented to the Most Beloved People" or "Presented to the Brave Korean People's Army." The shiny bakelite pipe is engraved with the golden words: "Motherland - My Mother." The stationery is printed with the pattern of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea commemorative medal, and the envelope is printed with the pattern of Tiananmen, the capital of the great motherland. The specially made consolation cigarettes are beautifully decorated, with a heroic image of Chinese and Korean soldiers fighting side by side printed on the box, and every cigarette is printed with the heroic words - "Strike at the US Aggressors." On the snow-white silk handkerchief, the pattern of the glorious commemorative medal for Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea is printed in the center of the eight bright red characters of "Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country." Someone calculated that it would take 1,500 trucks to transport these consolation items alone.
    The workers in the factories that manufactured this large batch of consolation items deeply penetrated their great love into the products. The workers regarded it as the greatest glory and comfort that the finished products they produced could be used by the most beloved people. The workers in Shanghai, in cooperation with engineers and cadres, tried every means to create a new record in using machines to mass-print silk handkerchiefs; the workers in 34 enamel factories in Shanghai gave full play to their high enthusiasm, increasing the daily output of enamel cups from the past maximum of 12,000 to 80,000. Tianjin Hengda Cigarette Factory surpassed the highest historical record in both quality and quantity in the specially made consolation cigarettes. Employees of the private Xieli Bakelite Factory selected the workers with the best eyesight to inspect the goods, and if there was even a slight grain on the customized pipes, they would pick them out and put them aside, not letting them be packed and shipped. They said: "We want to make every beautiful and sturdy pipe accompany the Volunteers in fighting the enemy on the Korean front!" The workers in the sugar factory proposed: "We must make the sugar clean, and we will not work without washing our hands, to ensure that the heroes are strong and healthy when they eat it!" Transportation workers in Tianjin refused to accept wages when moving consolation items, saying: "We offer our voluntary labor as a gift to the heroes!"
    Among the consolation items, there are also many precious local products and specialties brought by representatives from various places. Among them are the famous Yunnan Tuo Tea, Guizhou Maotai Wine, Yunnan Baiyao, Xuanwei Ham, Sichuan Northern Tremella, and raisins from the Turpan Basin. There are also precious tonics specially sent to General Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai - wolfberries from Zhongwei County, Ningxia. The beautiful tapestry given to General Kim Il-sung by the people of Hotan, Xinjiang. In addition, representatives of ethnic minorities also brought many ethnic gifts: ethnic shoes and socks carefully embroidered by Qinghai girls, 46 Uyghur hats given by the Uyghur people, and the most respected gift of the Tibetan people - Hada.
    The soldiers of the Southwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are concerned about the cultural learning of the Volunteers, and they sent the latest quick literacy textbooks, literacy cards, word-matching cards, and sentence-writing cards to the Volunteers in battle. They said: "Let the Volunteer comrades better strengthen their cultural learning, quickly master modern tactics and technology, and severely attack the US aggressors, defend the motherland and world peace."
    The employees of Chongqing 101 Steel Plant engraved the red words "Dedicated to Commander Peng Dehuai," "Dedicated to General Kim Il-sung," and "Presented to Combat Heroes" on the Chinese-style steel rail samples they made for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway not long ago, and entrusted the delegation to bring them to the front. The factory's labor models dedicated their most precious honors - medals, commemorative medals, commemorative albums, etc. to the heroes on the front. They said: "Honor should first belong to the heroes who fought to defend the motherland and world peace!"
    The representatives of the delegation came to the Korean battlefield with great determination and joy. Bai Yuying, a preacher of the Chinese Christian Church in Beijing, her mother unfortunately died the day before her departure. After handling the funeral affairs, she resolutely set off with the delegation the next day. She said: "My mother's death is my personal matter, but the consolation is the people's matter. I am a member of the 475 million people and should come!" Her eighty-year-old father, Mr. Bai Chengyi, also encouraged her and said: "Go, you should go, this is for the strength of the motherland!" After receiving the notice to go to Korea, Deng Maiwei, a representative of the Yao ethnic group in Guangdong Province, walked across 90 miles of mountain roads to reach the concentration point. Lu Jindi, an advanced worker in the fine yarn workshop of the No. 19 State-owned Cotton Mill and a worker representative, was suffering from a headache when she heard the news of entering Korea. That day, due to her happy mood, she forgot her illness and even increased her production efficiency to watching 768 spindles, breaking the highest record of watching 576 spindles during the third labor competition. Fang Lingru, a 55-year-old professor in the Department of Literature at Fudan University, cares for the heroes on the front with a mother's heart. She said: "I usually love my children the most, but now I love the soldiers on the front even more than my children. Over the past two years, they have made great contributions to the cause of peace and have suffered all kinds of hardships. This time I can come to the front to comfort them, which really makes me feel both distressed and happy!"
    When the representatives left home, the same voice echoed throughout the vast land of the motherland: Tell the dearest people: We have people if you need people, and we have grain if you need grain..., our 475 million people are determined to step up production, support the front, and will not stop until the victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea!
    Now, the delegation is carrying out extensive consolation activities on the Korean front and in the rear. They will more closely combine the hearts of the Chinese and Korean people and the Chinese and Korean heroes. They will bring back to the motherland a large number of heroic deeds of the Volunteers and the Korean military and civilians. Through their activities, the heroic Chinese and Korean people's troops will fight more bravely, and the large-scale economic construction that the Chinese people are about to begin will be even more encouraged. They will certainly successfully and victoriously complete the glorious mission entrusted to them by the 475 million people.

    祖国人民的使者
    新华社记者  周泽民  林麟
    当中国人民志愿军出国作战两周年的英雄日子即将到来的时候，带着四亿七千五百万人民对中朝英雄部队和朝鲜人民的关怀和敬意的、由一千多人组成的中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团，又光荣地抵达了朝鲜前线。
    慰问团的规模是空前巨大的。全团代表是全国各地优秀人物的大集中：有以中国共产党为首的各民主党派的代表；有汉、蒙、回、藏、苗、彝、瑶、朝鲜、维吾尔、哈萨克、塔塔尔等各兄弟民族及海外归国华侨的代表；有工人、农民、解放军、学生、青年、妇女、文化工作者、新闻工作者、工商业者和宗教界的代表。
    代表们是从祖国的各个城市和农村，从祖国的边疆和东南海岸，从各个不同的工作岗位上汇合起来的。在他们之中，有来自祖国西部边疆，拔海五千多公尺的天山山脉北部的边疆建设者——人民解放军工兵部队代表崔在任；有来自青海草原的牧民代表夏保；有来自西康丹巴的藏族代表巴登；有来自东南海防线上的人民解放军海军战斗英雄陈立富；有来自神圣的国门鸭绿江畔的防空部队代表孔祥明；有新自海外归国的华侨代表陈仰曾。从地理上看，我们祖国——特别是西南和西北的边疆地区和朝鲜前线是相隔得那样遥远，但是，正如翻山涉水万里远来的代表们所说：“透过千重云雾万重山，我们的心时刻飞向前线，和英雄们拥抱在一起。”
    在慰问团中，有在各种建设战线上杰出的劳动模范；有著名的工业劳动模范马恒昌；有农业劳动模范曾广福；有飞驰在边疆沙漠地区的西北汽车驾驶模范王宪章；有积极钻研、改进数部机器、从普通工人提升为副厂长的工业模范钱嘉光；有十七岁的著名的陈树兰先进小组模范落纱工作者杨嘉华；有农业丰产模范西北丰产模范村——王蟒村村长益冀东；有为成渝铁路制造钢轨提前完成任务的重庆一○一钢铁厂青年代表何大海；有建设天兰铁路的工人代表刘永会。此外，在慰问团中还有模范烈士家属代表董存瑞烈士的父亲董全忠，志愿军空军战斗英雄张积慧的父亲、模范军属张本周。
    在慰问团中，还有京剧名演员叶盛兰、杜近芳；评剧名演员小白玉霜；山东快书名演员高元钧；爱国女艺人常香玉；电影演员金焰、赵丹；以及中国人民革命军事委员会总政治部文艺工作团和来自华东、华北、东北、西北、西南、中南的文艺工作队。
    这就是中国人民所派遣的最优秀的代表。就是这些代表，将带给前线比任何礼物都珍贵的几万万人民的心意。
    当中国人民组织第二届赴朝慰问团的消息在各个城市、农村、山间和海上传开时，从边陲地区到中心城市，从机关到家庭，人们是以多么深厚的感情委托自己的代表把崇高的关怀和敬意带到前线去啊！王蟒村的农民们向他们的代表益冀东说：“你是知道的，我们是多么想念我们最可爱的人啊！我们过年过节想念着他们；刮风下雨关心着他们；看见茁壮的庄稼感激着他们；穿起新衣也想起了他们。借着你去的机会，替我们好好慰问他们吧！”许多地方的工人、农民都向代表们提出增加生产、支援前线的计划。西南一位农民妇女背着她的娃娃冒雨送十九岁的女代表张莉蓉赴朝时，再三叮嘱说：
    “我们一定代替你完成爱国丰产计划，你好好去慰问我们的亲人吧！多多把他们的英雄故事带回来说给我们听呵！”新疆维吾尔族农民木沙肉孜在欢送他们的代表阿赛德时，紧紧地握着阿赛德的手说：
    “我真想和你一道去慰问最可爱的人，希望你代表维吾尔族，特别代表我木沙肉孜，向最亲爱的人表达我最崇高的敬意。你要像我现在和你握手一样，紧紧地去和志愿军、人民军握手，把我的爱带给他们。你要好好了解他们需要和最喜欢什么东西，回来告诉我，我一定全力支援和设法满足他们的需要……。”说这话时，他激动得流下了眼泪。
    中国人民选择了最有意义的礼物，托代表们带到前方来送给站在保卫世界和平和祖国安全最前列的英雄们。
    在礼物中，我们可以看到有志愿军指挥员和战斗员们最关切的东西：描写祖国三年来建设上伟大成就的各种书籍、画报和图片。其中有成套的“伟大的祖国”的照片；有成渝铁路从开始修建到提前通车的整套照片；有西北天兰铁路提前八个月通车的文字报告；还有建设康藏高原、发展生产和两年来治淮工程以及新中国在前进等方面的图片……。
    慰问品中，最多的是大批精制的毛巾、手帕、搪瓷杯、烟斗、纪念册、信笺、信封、香烟、糖果以及部分象牙筷、银筷和汾酒等。每一件慰问品上，都有情意深长的语言。白色的搪瓷杯喷上红色的“赠给最可爱的人”或“赠给英勇的朝鲜人民军”的字。乌光闪闪的电木烟斗上镌着金色的字：“祖国——我的母亲”。信笺上印有抗美援朝纪念章的图案，信封上印有伟大祖国的首都天安门的图案。特制的慰问烟，装璜得十分美丽，盒子上印有并肩战斗的中朝战士的英雄像，每支纸烟上，都印有英雄的语言——“打击美国侵略者”。雪白的丝质手帕上，在“抗美援朝、保家卫国”八个鲜红大字的当中印着光辉灿烂的抗美援朝纪念章的图案。有人计算了一下：光运送这些慰问品，就需要一千五百辆大卡车。
    承制这大批慰问品的各工厂里的工人们，把自己伟大的爱深深渗透在产品中。工人们以生产出来的成品能为最可爱的人使用引为最大的光荣和安慰。上海的工人，和工程师、干部通力合作，想尽一切办法，创造了使用机器大规模印染丝质手帕的新纪录；上海三十四家搪瓷厂的工人，发挥了高度的积极性，使搪瓷杯从过去每天最高产量一万二千只提高到每天制造八万只。天津恒大烟厂在特制的慰问烟中，质量和数量都超过了历史上的最高纪录。私营协力电木厂职工挑选眼力最好的工人验货，只要定制的烟斗上有一丝纹路，就挑出来放在一边，不让装箱运走。他们说：“要使每一个又美观又坚固的烟斗，伴随志愿军在朝鲜前线打击敌人！”制糖厂的工人们提出：“一定把糖做得干净，不洗手不工作，保证英雄们吃了身强力壮！”天津市的运输工人在搬运慰问品时，拒绝收受工资，他们说：“我们以义务劳动作为对英雄们的献礼！”
    慰问品中还有各地代表们带来的许多名贵的土产、特产。其中有著名的云南沱茶，贵州的茅台酒，云南的白药，宣威的火腿，川北的银耳，吐鲁蕃盆地的葡萄干。还有专门送给金日成将军和彭德怀司令员的名贵补品——宁夏中卫县的构杞子。新疆和阗人民献给金日成将军的美丽的壁毯。此外，少数民族代表还带来许多的民族礼物：有青海姑娘精心刺绣的民族鞋、袜，维吾尔族人民赠的四十六顶维吾尔帽子和藏族人民最尊敬的礼物——哈达。
    中国人民解放军西南军区的战士们关怀着志愿军的文化学习，他们把最新的速成识字法课本和识字牌、配字牌、写话牌送给战斗中的志愿军。他们说：“让志愿军同志们更好地加强文化学习，迅速地掌握现代化的战术和技术，狠狠地打击美国侵略者，保卫祖国与世界和平。”
    重庆一○一钢铁厂的职工们，在不久前为成渝路所做的中华式钢轨样品上镌上“献给彭德怀司令员”、“献给金日成将军”和“赠给战斗英雄”等红字，托慰问团把它们带到前线来。厂里的劳动模范们将自己最珍贵的荣誉——奖章、纪念章、纪念册等献给前线的英雄们。他们说：“荣誉首先应该属于为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平而战的英雄们！”
    慰问团的代表们都带着极大的决心和喜悦来到朝鲜战地。北京市中华基督教布道员白玉瑛在出发的前一天，她的母亲不幸病故，她料理丧事后，第二天就毅然地随团出发。她说：“母亲死是我个人的事，慰问是人民的事，我是四亿七千五百万人民中的一员，就应该来！”她的八十岁的父亲白诚一老先生也鼓励她说：“去，应该去，这是为了祖国的强嘛！”广东省瑶族代表邓买尾一接到到朝鲜去的通知后，就徒步翻越九十里的山路赶到集中地。国棉十九厂细纱间先进工作者、工人代表陆金弟，在听到入朝的消息时，正患头痛，当天由于心情愉快把病也忘了，竟将生产效率提高到看七百六十八个纱锭，突破了第三次劳动竞赛时看五百七十六个纱锭的最高纪录。五十五岁的复旦大学文学系教授方令儒，以母亲的心情关怀着前线的英雄们。她说：“我平常是最爱我的儿女的，现在我爱前线上的战士们甚于我的儿女。两年来，他们对和平事业作了多大的贡献，吃了千辛万苦，这次我能来到前线慰问他们，真使我又心疼，又喜欢！”
    当代表们离家就道时，在祖国广大的土地上到处震响着同一个声音：告诉最亲爱的人们：要人有人，要粮有粮……，我们四亿七千五百万人民，决心加紧生产，支援前线，不到抗美援朝战争胜利结束，誓不休止！
    现在，慰问团正在朝鲜前线和后方展开广泛的慰问活动。他们将把中、朝人民和中、朝英雄们的心更加紧密地结合在一起。他们将把志愿军和朝鲜军民大量的英雄事迹带回祖国。通过他们的活动，将使英雄的中、朝人民部队战斗得更英勇，将使中国人民即将开始的大规模的经济建设得到更大的鼓舞。他们定将出色地胜利地完成四亿七千五百万人民所交给的光荣使命。
