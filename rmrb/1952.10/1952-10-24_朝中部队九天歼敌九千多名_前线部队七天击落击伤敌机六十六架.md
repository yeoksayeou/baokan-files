Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 23rd – In the past week, the enemy launched a so-called "largest offensive since last October" in the central sector. This offensive was met with a heavy blow by our frontline troops.

	This fierce battle took place on a front line stretching approximately ten li from the northeast of Tieyuan to the north of Jinhua. The enemy deployed up to two divisions. The enemy pounced fiercely, vainly attempting to salvage some face after their recent disastrous defeat, but what they "reaped" was a large number of casualties. Before dawn on October 14, the enemy unleashed a barrage of intense artillery fire, followed by simultaneous assaults with more than two regiments on two high grounds south of Shangganling north of Jinhua, and five other forward outposts of our army nearby. Our defending troops fought bravely to meet the enemy, and in the first day of battle alone, our army killed or wounded more than 1,300 enemy soldiers. In five locations, the enemy was routed after only two or three hours of fighting. After the 14th, the enemy continued its offensive, but all were bravely repelled by our frontline defenders. The fighting on the two high grounds south of Shangganling north of Jinhua was the fiercest and lasted the longest. On the first day, the enemy attacked here with five battalions, supported by aircraft and tanks. In a series of continuous battles for the hills, the enemy once climbed to the top of the hills, but was eventually driven back down by our army. More than 400 enemy bodies were abandoned on the slopes. In order to seize one of the hills, which was more than 500 meters high, the enemy launched continuous attacks with four battalions every day. The field fortifications on this hill changed hands several times. Whenever the enemy temporarily occupied the field fortifications, our army retreated into nearby tunnels to continue killing and wounding the enemy. On the 19th, our army launched a fierce counterattack under the cover of powerful artillery fire, annihilating more than 2,500 enemy troops in one fell swoop.

	By the 20th, more than 8,000 enemy troops had been annihilated on this section of the front. The so-called "largest offensive since last October" has begun to decline.

	In addition, in the eight days from the 12th to the 19th, our army successively captured nine enemy outposts in areas west of Wendengli, west of Jincheng, and northwest of Lianchuan, annihilating three full enemy battalions, one full company, four full platoons, and the majority of two companies and two platoons, totaling more than 1,200 enemy troops. In areas such as Gaoyangdae, northwest of Gaolangpu-ri, and northeast of Jiaoyan Mountain, our army repelled more than ten enemy incursions, annihilating more than 500 enemy troops.

	In the seven days from the 12th to the 18th, our frontline anti-aircraft artillery units shot down 32 enemy aircraft and damaged 34 enemy aircraft.

    朝中部队九天歼敌九千多名
    前线部队七天击落击伤敌机六十六架
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十三日电】在最近一周内，敌军在中线发动了一次所谓自去年十月以来“最大的攻势”。这一攻势，遭到我前线部队的沉重打击。
    这一激烈的战斗，发生在铁原东北到金化以北约十多里的一段战线上。敌人投入的兵力达两个师。敌人恶狠狠地扑来，妄图为它们不久前的惨败捞回一点面子，但是它“收获”到的却是大量的伤亡。十月十四日黎明前，敌军发射了一阵猛烈的炮火，随后便以两个多团的兵力同时向金化以北上甘岭以南的两个高地，和附近的另外五个我军前哨阵地发起冲锋。我守军奋勇迎击敌人，仅在第一天的战斗中，我军即杀伤敌军一千三百多人。其中有五个地方，只打了两三小时，敌军就被击溃。十四日以后，敌军继续其攻势，但都被我前线守军英勇击退。其中以金化以北上甘岭以南两个高地上的战斗最激烈，持续最久。敌军在第一天中以五个营的兵力向这里进攻，并有飞机坦克配合。在连续的山头争夺战中，敌人曾一度爬上山头，但最后仍被我军赶下山去。敌军遗弃在山坡上的尸体，就有四百多具。敌人为了抢夺其中一个五百多公尺高的山头，每天投入四个营的兵力连续进攻。这一山头上的野战工事曾几度易手。每当敌人暂时占领野战工事后，我军便转入附近的隧道中继续杀伤敌人。十九日，我军在强大炮火掩护下猛烈反击，一举歼灭敌人二千五百多名。
    到二十日为止，敌军在这一段战线上已被歼灭八千多名。所谓自去年十月以来的“最大的攻势”，已开始衰退下去。
    另外，在十二日到十九日的八天中，我军先后又在文登里以西，金城以西和涟川西北等地区攻占敌人九处前哨阵地，歼灭守敌三个整营、一个整连、四个整排、和两个连、两个排的大部，共计一千二百多名。在高阳垈、高浪浦里西北、轿岩山东北等地区我军击退敌人十多次窜扰，歼敌五百多名。
    在十二日到十八日的七天中，我军前线对空射击部队共击落敌机三十二架，击伤敌机三十四架。
