    Beijing Successfully Builds Asphalt Pebble Roads
    Editor: In the past, when we built asphalt roads, we used crushed stone with sharp edges quarried from the mountains as aggregate. Recently, our technical personnel learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and adopted the method of using pebbles as aggregate. The source of pebbles is very convenient, and no processing is required. We have now changed most of the pebble roads originally planned to be built in the eastern and western suburbs of Beijing to asphalt pebble roads. The unit price per cubic meter of asphalt pebble road is 32,000 to 49,000 yuan, but the unit price per cubic meter of asphalt crushed stone road is more than 110,000 yuan. Promoting this advanced road construction method in other parts of the country will definitely save the country a lot of wealth. In areas with more pebbles, using this road construction method will save even more.

    北京市修筑沥青卵石路成功
    编辑同志：过去我们修筑沥青路时，都是用山上开采出来带棱角的碎石做骨材，最近我们的技术人员学习苏联先进经验，采用以卵石做骨材的办法。卵石的来源很方便，又不用加工。现在我们已将原拟在北京东郊、西郊修筑的大部分卵石路改为沥青卵石路。沥青卵石路每方公尺的单价为三万二千元到四万九千元，但沥青碎石路每方公尺的单价却为十一万多元。在全国其他地区推广这一先进的筑路方法，一定能为国家节省大量的财富。在多卵石的地区，采用这个筑路方法，节约会更多一些。
