    Scholarship and Peace
    —Excerpts from the Speech by Nan Bo, Deputy Head of the Japanese Delegation and Professor at Hitotsubashi University

    As a scientist, I feel two great joys now that I am on Chinese soil.
    First, needless to say, is the joy of attending this peace conference, as I firmly believe that scholarship dedicated to striving for peace is true scholarship.
    The second joy is that I have personally witnessed that in China, scholarship already belongs to the people, and it exists for the people.
    We scientists must draw a living lesson from the fact that in China, natural and social sciences serving peace are contributing to the happiness of the people every day.
    Needless to say, science and technology should serve peace-loving people. But today, warmongers are mobilizing science and technology for war purposes.
    Since the beginning of human history, the most cruel examples of the use of natural science and technology have been the atomic bomb, germ warfare, and chemical warfare.
    American imperialism, not only in its own country but also in Japan, which it has forcibly enslaved, is mobilizing science and technology for brutal war and aggression against the whole of Asia.
    Departments related to military affairs in Japanese universities, such as ordnance and pyrotechnics, which had been temporarily suspended after the war, have virtually been revived. In the field of germ warfare, a group of Japanese bacteriologists, who can be said to be the predecessors of the Americans and who had been purged, have long been cooperating with American imperialists. This group of Japanese scientists and technicians are faithfully acting as accomplices of the United States, expanding their inhumane criminal acts in the war of aggression against Korea.
    After Japan signed the San Francisco unilateral peace treaty, the entire Japanese territory has definitively become a military base for the United States.
    Faced with such a crisis, we must resolutely fight against the aggressors who lead science and technology astray and lead culture to its death.
    Our task is to wrest the brilliant science and technology, which our ancestors painstakingly built, from the hands of the demons of war.
    Scientists must also realize that resolutely defending peace is the most urgent and important task today, and act according to this conviction.
    So, what specific work must we carry out immediately?
    The first is the issue of stopping and opposing war. On the one hand, some natural scientists participated in the American germ warfare in Korea and became war criminals; but on the other hand, the International Scientific Commission, organized to scientifically investigate the facts of germ warfare, is an exciting example of natural science being mobilized to stop war and achieve peace.
    I would like to take this opportunity to express my respect to the scientists who participated in this investigation for their adherence to the truth in the face of all persecution by reactionary forces.
    We hope that natural scientists will continue to expose the facts of war crimes scientifically in the future, and declare as loudly as possible who are the enemies of peace and who are the enemies of science.
    We must affirm once again that in the absence of peace, independence, and freedom, science, technology, and culture will either be led astray or will face death.
    We must recognize that only the realization of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, a prerequisite for peace in Asia and the Pacific, can establish true independence, autonomy, and freedom not only for Asia, but also for other countries oppressed under imperialism today.

    学问与和平
    ——日本代表团副团长、日本国立一桥大学教授南博发言摘要
    我作为一个科学家，现在在中国的土地上，感到了两种很大的喜悦。
    其一，不用说就是：深信争取和平的学问才是真正的学问的我，出席了这次和平会议的喜悦。
    第二个喜悦就是：我亲自看到了，在中国，学问已经为人民所有，它为人民而存在。
    我们科学家必须从这样一个事实得到活的教训，那就是：在中国，为和平服务的自然科学和社会科学，是每天都在为人民的幸福而贡献着力量的。
    不用说，科学和技术，是应该为爱好和平的人民服务的。但今天，战争贩子们正把科学和技术动员到为了战争目的方面去。
    自人类有历史以来，自然科学和技术以最残酷的方法被利用的例子，那就是原子弹、细菌战和化学战。
    美帝国主义，不仅在其本国，同时也在其强迫奴化中的日本，正在把科学和技术动员到对整个亚洲的残暴的战争和侵略上面。
    战后曾经中断过一时的、日本各大学有关军事方面的学科，例如兵工学、火药学等部门，实际上已在复活。在细菌战方面，可以说是美国人的前辈的、那一群曾经被整肃过的日本细菌学者，早已经和美帝国主义者合作了。这一群日本的科学家和技术工作者们，正在忠实地充当美国的帮凶，在侵朝战争中扩大他们的无人道的犯罪行为。
    日本签订旧金山片面和约以后，整个日本国土已经决定地变成了美国的军事基地。
    面临着这样的危机，我们必须对把科学和技术引入歧途并使文化走向死亡的侵略者，坚决地进行斗争。
    我们的任务，就是把这个我们的祖先们辛勤建立起来的、辉煌的科学和技术，从战争贩子的魔鬼的手中夺回来。
    科学家也必须觉悟到，坚决地保卫和平，是今日最紧急、最重大的任务，并根据这个信念行动起来。
    那末，我们必须立刻具体地进行的工作是什么呢？
    首先是制止和反对战争的问题。一方面有部分自然科学家参加美国在朝鲜进行的细菌战而成为战争罪犯；但另一方面，为了科学地调查细菌战的事实而组织起来的国际科学委员会，正是自然科学为了制止战争和达成和平而被动员起来的、令人兴奋的例子。
    我愿借这个机会，对参加这次调查的科学家们，不畏惧反动势力的一切迫害而坚持真理的行为，表示敬意。
    我们希望自然科学家，今后继续从科学上揭露战争犯罪的事实，并尽量大声地宣布谁是和平的敌人，谁是科学的敌人。
    我们必须再一次肯定：在没有和平、独立和自由的地方，科学、技术和文化，或者被引入歧途，或者要遭到死亡。
    我们必须认识到：唯有对日本实现缔结全面和约这一个亚洲及太平洋的和平的前提条件，不仅是亚洲，包括其他今日在帝国主义统治下受着压迫的各国，才能确立真正的独立、自主和自由。（新华社）
