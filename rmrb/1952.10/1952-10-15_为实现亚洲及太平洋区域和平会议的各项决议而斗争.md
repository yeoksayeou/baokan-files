    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in our capital, Beijing, successfully concluded on the morning of October 13th. This conference achieved complete success, which will undoubtedly be of great significance in further mobilizing and organizing the vast people of Asian and Pacific countries to defend peace and oppose aggression. We warmly celebrate the complete success of this conference.
     The great achievement of this conference lies first in the fact that, after the discussions at this conference, the peace representatives of various countries have reached a completely consistent understanding of the crux of the current situation. As pointed out in the documents unanimously adopted by this conference: the policy of aggressive war adopted by the US government and the governments of some countries that follow the US government is the general root cause of the serious threats to international peace and the national independence of the people of all countries. At this conference, it was clearly distinguished who is the enemy of international peace and national independence, and who is the friend of international peace and national independence. This thoroughly exposed all the hypocritical propaganda of the heads of the US government and the US generals who are trying to fool the people and drag them into the abyss of a new war. This matter is very important for mobilizing and uniting the broader masses of the people of all countries to participate in the struggle to defend peace and oppose aggression.
    Secondly, this conference formulated a concrete action program for the 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions to strive for and defend peace, as well as to strive for and defend national independence. The delegates to the conference unanimously adopted two declarations and nine resolutions, the main contents of which are: (1) To immediately achieve a ceasefire in Korea on a fair and reasonable basis; to end the wars in Vietnam, Malaya and other regions; and to withdraw all foreign troops from these regions. (2) To prevent the revival of Japanese militarism; to conclude genuine peace treaties between relevant countries and Japan; and to establish a new Japan that is independent, democratic, free, and peaceful. (3) To oppose one country interfering in the internal affairs of another country; to oppose one country infringing upon the sovereignty of another country; and to defend and realize national independence. (4) To oppose blockades and embargoes; and to promote economic cooperation and cultural exchange among countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. (5) To prohibit incitement to war; to oppose racial discrimination; to defend women's rights; and to promote children's welfare. (6) To promptly conclude a five-power peace pact. To implement disarmament and prohibit the use of atomic, bacteriological, and chemical weapons, as well as other weapons of mass slaughter. (7) In order to publicize the resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and promote their implementation, to establish an Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee as a permanent liaison institution for the peace movements among the countries in this region. The above-mentioned declarations and resolutions of this conference represent the urgent demands and the highest interests of the 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions at the present stage. Therefore, they will undoubtedly be able to guide the broader masses of the people to unite and struggle forward, and to achieve complete victory in defending peace and national independence through long-term efforts.
    The victory of this conference once again proves that: in the common cause of defending peace and freedom, the broad masses of the people of all countries are able to unite themselves and unite with each other. The three hundred and sixty-seven delegates from thirty-seven countries who participated in this conference, despite their different races and nationalities, different classes and occupations, different religious beliefs, and different political views, were able to reach a complete consensus after sincere democratic discussions and consultations. The widespread application of this broad united front approach and sincere consultation method will surely powerfully promote the further upsurge of the peace movement in various countries.
    The Chinese people are the initiators of this conference with great historical significance, which is a great honor for our people. But precisely because of this, a major responsibility falls on the shoulders of our people: our people must most actively and exemplarily implement the various resolutions of this conference, and most actively and exemplarily unite all the people in Asian and Pacific countries who love peace and freedom, in order to realize the various resolutions of this conference.
    The declarations and resolutions of this conference should be disseminated to every corner of our country, so that every household knows about and supports and implements these declarations and resolutions. In order to achieve this, the reporters and propagandists in various places should take the great achievements of this conference as the center, and widely conduct propaganda among the masses of the people on international and domestic current affairs, and mobilize people from all walks of life to hold small gatherings during the gaps in production and work to discuss the various decisions of this conference. In these propaganda activities, it is necessary to call on the people of the whole country, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, to unanimously support and implement the various resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference with practical actions. We must call on the people of the whole country to further strengthen the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, to strive for a greater victory in the struggle against aggression, to achieve a ceasefire in Korea on a fair and reasonable basis, and to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue under the principle of withdrawing all foreign troops, in order to restore and consolidate peace in the Far East. We must also call on the people of the whole country to more broadly launch the patriotic production increase movement, to support the Chinese People's Volunteers who are heroically fighting to defend our country's security, to defend peace in the Far East and the world, and to welcome the large-scale peaceful construction that is about to begin. These are the main practical tasks that the people of our country should do in order to implement the resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Every new victory in our work will be a new blow to the aggressors and war-mongers, and will be a new contribution to the cause of peace. Let the people of our country unite better themselves, and unite better with the people of Asian and Pacific countries, and with the people of the world, and continue to advance towards greater victories in defending peace and opposing aggression, and towards greater victories in building our great country!

    为实现亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各项决议而斗争
    在我国首都北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，已经在十月十三日早晨闭幕了。这次会议取得了圆满的成功，这对于进一步动员和组织亚洲及太平洋区域各国广大人民起来保卫和平、反对侵略，毫无疑问是有极大意义的。我们热烈地庆祝这次会议的圆满成功。
     这次会议的巨大成就，首先在于，经过了这次会议的讨论，各国和平代表对于目前形势的症结所在已经有了完全一致的认识。正如这次会议一致通过的各项文件所指出：美国政府以及追随美国政府的一些国家的政府所采取的侵略战争政策，就是国际和平和各国人民的民族独立遭受严重威胁的总根源。在这个会议上，谁是国际和平和民族独立的敌人，谁是国际和平和民族独立的友人，是分得清清楚楚的了。这样就彻底地揭穿了美国政府首脑和美国将军们一切愚弄人民、企图把人民拖入新战争深渊的虚伪宣传。这件事，对于动员和团结各国更加广大的人民来参加保卫和平、反对侵略的斗争，是十分重要的。
    其次在于，这次会议为亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民制订了一部争取和保卫和平，以及争取和保卫民族独立的具体的行动纲领。这次会议全体代表一致地通过了两个宣言书和九项决议，其最主要的内容，就是：（一）立即在公平合理的基础上，实现朝鲜的停战；结束越南、马来亚及其他地区的战争；并从这些地区撤退一切外国军队。（二）制止日本军国主义复活；缔结有关各国与日本之间的真正的和约；建立独立、民主、自由与和平的新日本。（三）反对一个国家干涉另一国家的内政；反对一个国家侵犯另一国家的主权；保卫并实现民族独立。（四）反对封锁和禁运；在平等互利基础上促进各国间的经济合作和文化交流。（五）禁止煽动战争；反对种族歧视；保卫妇女权利，增进儿童福利。（六）迅速缔结五大国和平公约。实行裁减军备，禁止使用原子、细菌和化学武器及其他大规模屠杀的武器。（七）为了宣传亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的决议，并促其实现，建立亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会，作为本区域各国间和平运动的常设联络机构。这次会议的上述宣言和决议，代表了亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民在目前阶段的迫切要求和最高利益，因此它们毫无疑问地必定能够引导更加广大的人民群众，团结一致地向前斗争，经过长期的努力，来达到保卫和平和民族独立的完全胜利。
    这次会议的胜利，又一次地证明了：在保卫和平和自由的共同事业中，各国的广大人民是能够自己团结起来，并且互相团结起来的。参加这次会议的来自三十七个国家的三百六十七位代表，尽管种族和民族不同，阶层和职业不同，宗教信仰不同，政治见解不同，但是经过真诚的民主讨论和协商，便能取得完全的意见一致。这种广泛的团结方针和真诚的协商办法的广泛应用，必能有力地推动各国和平运动的进一步高涨。
    中国人民是这次具有巨大历史意义的会议的倡议者，这是我国人民的极大光荣。但正因为这样，一个重大的责任就落在我国人民的肩上：我国人民必须最积极地、模范地执行这次会议的各项决议，最积极地、模范地团结亚洲及太平洋各国一切爱好和平和自由的人民，来实现这次会议的各项决议。
    这次会议的宣言和各项决议，应该传布到我们全国的每一个角落去，使家家户户都知道并且拥护和执行这些宣言和决议。为着做到这一步，各地的报告员、宣传员，都应该以这次会议的伟大成就为中心，向人民群众广泛地进行一次关于国际时事和国内时事的宣传，并发动各界群众，利用生产和工作的空隙，举行小型集会，来讨论这次会议的各项决定。在这些宣传工作中，必须号召全国人民，包括中国人民志愿军在内，一致拥护、并以实际行动来执行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各项决议。我们必须号召全国人民更加加强抗美援朝的工作，来争取反侵略斗争的更大胜利，达到在公平合理的基础上实现朝鲜的停战，并在撤退一切外国军队的原则下达到朝鲜问题的和平解决，以便恢复和巩固远东的和平。我们还必须号召全国人民更加广泛地开展爱国增产运动，来支援正在为保卫我国安全、为保卫远东及世界和平而英勇斗争的中国人民志愿军，和迎接即将开始的大规模的和平建设。这些就是我们全国人民为贯彻亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的决议所应该做的主要的实际工作。我们这些工作的每一个新的胜利，都将是对于侵略者和战争贩子的新的打击，都将是对于和平事业的新的贡献。让我们全国人民自己更好地团结起来，并与亚洲及太平洋各国人民、与全世界人民更好地团结起来，向着保卫和平和反对侵略的更大胜利，向着建设我们伟大国家的更大胜利而继续前进吧！
