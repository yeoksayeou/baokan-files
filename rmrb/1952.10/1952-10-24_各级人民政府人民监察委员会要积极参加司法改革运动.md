    People's Supervisory Committees at All Levels of People's Governments Should Actively Participate in the Judicial Reform Movement
    Tan Pingshan, Director of the People's Supervisory Committee of the Government Administration Council

    The vigorous judicial reform movement is unfolding across the country. This is a revolutionary movement against old legal viewpoints and to reform the entire judicial organs. The purpose of this movement is to thoroughly transform and rectify people's judicial organs at all levels, eliminate those bad elements who violate laws and regulations and are deeply entrenched in bad habits beyond redemption, eradicate the influence of reactionary old legal viewpoints and old judicial styles, establish the people's revolutionary legal viewpoints and revolutionary work styles, purify the people's judicial organs politically, organizationally, and ideologically, gradually establish and improve the people's judicial system, and reform political and legal education. Therefore, the judicial reform movement is an important measure to further strengthen and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement. Moreover, the judicial reform movement is of great importance to the cause of national construction. Stalin said, "At present, during the period of construction, the suppression organs, the army, and other organizations are as necessary as they were during the civil war. Without these organs, it is impossible for the dictatorship to carry out guaranteed construction work." Chairman Mao said, "Our current task is to strengthen the people's state apparatus, which mainly refers to the people's army, the people's police, and the people's courts, in order to protect national defense and the interests of the people." People's judicial organs at all levels have played a positive role in the construction of the motherland and have achieved certain successes. However, the materials revealed in the judicial reform movement show that many people's judicial organs, because they are manipulated and corrupted by a small number of bad elements and personnel with strong old legal viewpoints, do not use the people's new laws as the basis for handling cases, but instead follow the complicated judicial procedures formulated by the reactionary rulers to oppress and make things difficult for the working people. They adopt methods of ignoring, not summoning, not inquiring, not judging, and not executing to deal with the lawsuits of the people. Some even wear the cloak of revolution, use their powers to engage in shameless acts of embezzlement, bribery, extortion, and rape of women. More seriously, they completely stand on the reactionary class position, shield counter-revolutionaries, speak for counter-revolutionaries, allow them to be at large, and condone their destruction of the cause of national construction, committing serious crimes that endanger the interests of the state and the people. Therefore, the proposal of this judicial reform movement is very correct and timely, and it will create strong guarantee conditions for our country's large-scale economic construction and cultural construction. Therefore, carrying out the judicial reform movement is a great political task.
    The People's Supervisory Committees at all levels are organs that supervise whether state organs at all levels and their public servants violate state policies, laws, or harm the interests of the state and the people, and accept and handle people's accusations against public servants. In this judicial reform movement, they must give full play to the role of supervisory work. The People's Supervisory Committee of the Government Administration Council has already instructed the People's Supervisory Committees in various regions to cooperate in carrying out the judicial reform movement at the beginning of the movement, and the People's Supervisory Committees in various regions have already done some work in this regard.
    Since the source of old legal viewpoints is the reactionary ruling class's view of the state and law, as well as the reactionary laws, decrees, and judicial system that safeguard the interests of the ruling class, then those who are invaded by this poisonous influence are not only the people's judicial organs, but also some people with weak revolutionary will in other organs of power will also be affected by it. Therefore, the struggle against old legal viewpoints should also become a task of the people's supervisory organs themselves.
    Our people's supervisory organs were newly established after the founding of New China, and attention was paid to political quality when allocating cadres. Therefore, the organization of people's supervisory committees in various regions is generally pure. However, in the "Three-Anti" movement, a very small number of people's supervisory committees were exposed to have impure organizations. This cannot be ignored. Some people's supervisory committees, when handling people's complaint cases, did not adopt a positive and responsible attitude towards the masses, did not pay attention to the actual effect of solving problems, but instead pushed things off; or transferred them level by level, delaying the time; or did not pay attention to inspection, simply relying on official documents, making the problems unresolved for a long time. For example, the People's Supervisory Committee of Hebei Province, regarding the case reported by Dou Tianlin that his son was subjected to torture by village cadres for stealing grain and was fined grain many times, which affected the life of his whole family, sent a letter to the Luan County People's Government for investigation and handling in June 1950. By June 1951, it had urged five times without a solution, and then transferred it to the Tangshan Special District Office for investigation and handling. By August 1952, it had urged five times and still had not been resolved. This is intolerable. Some supervisory personnel showed the bad style of "imperial envoys" when inspecting work; some put on bureaucratic airs, did not approach the masses, and aroused the opposition of the masses, saying, "Such people cannot do supervisory work!" There were also supervisory personnel who did not pay attention to investigation and research when handling cases, emphasized the old subjective and arbitrary interrogation techniques, and believed that cases could be judged based on facial expressions; others often quoted old legal provisions and old legal terms, believing that these words and sentences were "concise and comprehensive" and "accurate and appropriate." This is the erosion of the old legal viewpoint on the people's supervisory organs, which must be criticized and eliminated in conjunction with the judicial reform movement, so as to improve the people's supervisory work.
    In order to assist the judicial organs in carrying out the judicial reform movement, the People's Supervisory Committees at all levels should strengthen the work and leadership of the people's supervisory correspondents, the people's reporting reception rooms, and the people's opinion boxes. The current central task of the people's supervisory correspondents should be to investigate and report on the illegal and disciplinary facts of judicial personnel. The people's reporting reception rooms should provide various conveniences to the reporting personnel. The people's opinion boxes should be in charge of special personnel and opened on time. All materials and opinions reported by the people must be dealt with quickly, and those that should be handled by relevant departments should be transferred quickly, and no backlog should be allowed. Those who retaliate against or retaliate against the informants must be severely punished. The handling of illegal and disciplinary cases in the judicial reform movement should be serious and cautious, seek truth from facts, and strictly prevent hasty actions. It is necessary to earnestly grasp and implement the policy of combining ideological transformation with organizational rectification. The general bureaucratic work style should of course be opposed, but it should be distinguished from the old legal viewpoint and the old judicial work style, so as to focus on attacking the reactionary old legal viewpoint. For typical cases of educational significance, after handling, we should seize the opportunity to circulate notices or publicize them through other means. On the one hand, we should fully expose the crimes of bad elements mixed in the people's judicial organs and the harm of old ideas and old work styles. On the other hand, we should commend good cadres and establish models, so as to promote the movement, educate cadres and the masses, improve the understanding of the construction of the people's judiciary, and enhance the close relationship between the people's judicial organs and the people.
    In the judicial reform movement, some people mistakenly believe that New China does not yet have new laws, and has not yet cultivated new judicial cadres. If the old laws are completely abolished, there will be no basis for handling cases, and therefore they hold a skeptical attitude towards the movement. This is completely mystifying the law and defending the old law. In fact, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have long started the construction of people's laws in the process of creating people's power, and have accumulated a lot of judicial work experience. In the three years since the establishment of the Central People's Government, it has promulgated many important basic laws and other laws, decrees, regulations, and resolutions, which are all the criteria for us to handle cases. The basic conditions for people's judicial cadres are firm stand, correct viewpoints, and a pragmatic working spirit. All outstanding members of people's organizations such as workers, peasants, youth, and women can serve as judicial workers. The active elements in the existing judicial cadres can be promoted to important positions. Facts have proved that the people's courts in the land reform and "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have resolved many major and complex cases, and they have been resolved very well. Of course, the people's laws still need to be continuously created, and the people's judicial cadres still need to be trained in a planned way, but we must never doubt the judicial reform movement because of this. On the contrary, the judicial reform movement is an important step in educating judicial cadres and carrying out judicial construction.
    Now the judicial reform movement in various places has gained preliminary experience and achievements. The completion of this movement will make the people's judicial organs at all levels truly become a powerful weapon for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and ensuring national construction. This victorious outcome is foreseeable.

    各级人民政府人民监察委员会要积极参加司法改革运动
    政务院人民监察委员会主任　谭平山
    轰轰烈烈的司法改革运动，正在全国范围内展开。这是一个反对旧法观点和改革整个司法机关的革命运动。这个运动的目的是要彻底改造和整顿各级人民司法机关，清除那些违法乱纪和恶习甚深不堪改造的坏分子，肃清反动的旧法观点和旧司法作风的影响，树立人民的革命法律观点和革命工作作风，使人民司法机关从政治上、组织上和思想上纯洁起来，使人民的司法制度逐步的建立和健全起来；并改革政法教育。因此，司法改革运动是在“三反”运动的胜利基础上，进一步加强与巩固人民民主专政的重要措施。不仅如此，司法改革运动对于国家建设事业有着重大关系。斯大林说：“现时，在建设时期中，镇压机关、军队以及其他组织，也是如在国内战争时期一样必要的。如果没有这些机关，那末专政就没有可能进行有若干保证的建设工作。”毛主席说：“我们现在的任务是要强化人民的国家机器，这主要地是指人民的军队，人民的警察和人民的法庭，借以保护国防和保护人民利益。”各级人民司法机关在祖国的建设工作中，起了它的积极作用，是有一定成绩的。但是从司法改革运动中所揭露的材料说明，有不少的人民司法机关因为被少数坏分子和具有浓厚旧法观点的人员所操纵和腐蚀，它不以人民的新的法律做为处理案件的依据，而是沿用反动统治者制定的专以压迫和刁难劳动人民的繁琐的司法程序，采取不理、不传、不问、不判、不执行的办法，来对待人民群众的诉讼，甚至有的披着革命外衣，利用职权，进行贪赃枉法、敲诈勒索、奸淫妇女的无耻勾当，更严重的是它完全站在反动阶级立场，包庇反革命分子，替反革命分子说话，听任他们逍遥法外，放纵他们破坏国家建设事业，犯有危害国家和人民利益的严重罪行。因此，这次司法改革运动的提出是非常正确而适时的，它将给我们国家大规模经济建设和文化建设创造有力的保证条件。所以开展司法改革运动是一个伟大的政治任务。
    各级人民监察委员会是监察各级国家机关及其公务人员是否违反国家政策、法令或损害国家人民利益，并接受及处理人民对公务人员控诉的机关，在这次司法改革运动中，必须充分发挥监察工作的作用。政务院人民监察委员会在运动开始的时候，已经指示各地人民监察委员会配合进行司法改革运动，各地人民监察委员会已经在这方面做了一些工作。
    由于旧法观点的来源是反动统治阶级的国家观和法律观以及维护统治阶级利益的反动法律、法令和司法制度，那末，受到这种污毒侵袭的就不仅是人民司法机关，其他政权机关中的一些革命意志薄弱的人也同样会受到它的影响。因此，反对旧法观点的斗争，也应成为人民监察机关自身的任务。
    我们人民监察机关由于是在新中国诞生之后新建立的机关，在配备干部时并注意了政治质量，因此，各地人民监察委员会的组织一般说是纯洁的。但在“三反”运动中也暴露了极少数的人民监察委员会有组织不纯的现象。这是不容忽视的。有些人民监察委员会在处理人民控诉案件时，不是采取对群众积极负责的态度，不注意解决问题的实际效果，而是推出了事；或是层层转办，延误时日；或者不注意检查，单纯依靠公文来往，使问题长期不得解决。如河北省人民监察委员会对窦天霖反映其子因偷粮被村干部私刑拷打并多次罚粮，致影响其全家生活一案，于一九五○年六月函送滦县人民政府查处，至一九五一年六月催办五次，未得解决，又转送唐山专署查处，到一九五二年八月催办五次，仍未解决，这是不能容忍的。有的监察人员在检查工作时表现了“钦差大臣”的恶劣作风；有的摆官僚架子，不接近群众，引起群众反对说：“这样的人不能做监察工作！”还有的监察人员，在处理案件中不注意调查研究，强调旧的主观臆断的审讯技术，认为根据脸色表情即可判案；也有的经常引用旧法律条文和旧法律名词，认为这些词句是“言简意赅”，“确切妥当”。这就是旧法观点对于人民监察机关的侵蚀，必须结合司法改革运动予以批判清除，使人民监察工作提高一步。
    为了协助司法机关开展司法改革运动，各级人民监察委员会应加强人民监察通讯员、人民检举接待室和人民意见箱的工作与领导。人民监察通讯员目前应以调查报告司法人员的违法乱纪事实为中心任务之一。人民检举接待室应给检举人员以各种方便。人民意见箱应有专人负责，按时开检。所有人民检举的材料和意见，必须迅速处理，应交有关部门办理者，迅速转送，不得积压。如有打击或报复检举人者，必予严惩。对于司法改革运动中违法乱纪案件的处理，要严肃慎重，实事求是，严防草率从事，务须认真掌握与贯彻思想改造与组织整顿相结合的方针，一般的官僚主义作风当然应该反对，但应与旧法观点、旧司法作风区别开来，以便着重地打击反动的旧法观点。对于有教育意义的典型案件，在处理后应抓紧时机进行通报或通过其他方式宣传，一面应充分揭露混入人民司法机关中的坏分子的罪行和旧思想、旧作风的危害，一面应表扬好的干部，树立模范，借以推动运动，教育干部与群众，提高对人民司法建设的认识，增进人民司法机关与人民群众的密切联系。
    在司法改革运动中，有些人错误地认为新中国尚没有新法律，还未培养出新司法干部，如果完全废除了旧法，处理案件将无所依据，因而对运动抱着怀疑的态度。这完全是把法律神秘化，为旧法做辩护。事实上，中国人民在中国共产党领导下，在创造人民政权的过程中，早就着手了人民法律的建设，已经积累了不少的司法工作经验，中央人民政府成立三年来更颁布了许多重要的基本大法和其他法律、法令、条例和决议，这些都是我们处理案件的准绳。人民司法干部的基本条件是立场坚定、观点正确和实事求是的工作精神，所有工、农、青、妇等人民团体中的优秀分子都可充任司法工作人员，现有司法干部中的积极分子，更可提拔到重要岗位上来。事实证明：在土地改革和“三反”“五反”运动中的人民法庭，解决了很多重大、复杂的案件，而且是解决得很好。当然，人民的法律还需要继续创造，人民司法干部还需要有计划的培养，但绝不能因此怀疑司法改革运动，相反的，司法改革运动正是教育司法干部，进行司法建设的重要步骤。
    现在各地司法改革运动已经获得了初步经验和成绩，这个运动的完成，将使各级人民司法机关真正成为巩固人民民主专政，保证国家建设的有力武器。这一胜利成果是可以预期的。
