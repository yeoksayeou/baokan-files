    Great Harvest in the Lhasa Plain
    In the Lhasa Plain in September, if you walk along the green banks of the Lhasa River, you will see how the farmers and the People's Liberation Army soldiers are working hard and happily in the autumn harvest.
    This year in the Lhasa Plain, the yield of highland barley and wheat in most areas has doubled compared to last year. This is the first harvest season after the peaceful liberation of Tibet.
    Farmers in villages near Lhasa are celebrating the harvest with jubilation. On September 19th, farmers in many villages held meetings in their unique ethnic forms to celebrate the harvest. Dongka Village also held a grand horse racing festival on this day. A large white tent was set up in the open space in front of the village, with various ears of highland barley and wheat inserted in front of the tent. Villages nearby selected farmers who were tall and strong, dressed in the armor of warriors from the Tang Dynasty, carrying bows and arrows, holding fire guns, and riding decorated horses, to participate in the equestrian and archery competitions of the harvest celebration. Smiling Tibetan men and women, all dressed in their best clothes, also rushed to participate. The Tibetan farmers also invited the People's Liberation Army stationed nearby to participate in the grand event. On this day, the people celebrating the harvest danced, jumped, and sang heartily. At the same time, the People's Liberation Army also organized harvest teams, bringing sickles and cooking utensils, to help the farmers in the villages of the Lhasa Plain with the autumn harvest. Doctors from the Lhasa People's Hospital also went to the countryside with various medicines to treat sick farmers, ensuring that during the autumn harvest period, families with sick farmers would not be delayed in their harvest time due to illness.
    Before liberation, farmers in the Lhasa Plain, because they had no seeds during the spring plowing, left many fields barren. This spring, after the farmers in the Lhasa Plain received interest-free seed loans from the advance detachment political department of the troops entering Tibet, the phenomenon of land abandonment was greatly reduced. The People's Liberation Army soldiers took the lead in wasteland reclamation and production, which greatly encouraged the farmers' enthusiasm for production. Farmers in Deqing area also newly reclaimed more than 100 mu of wasteland this year. Families who rarely applied fertilizer to the fields in the past have increased the amount of fertilizer applied this year. In addition, with sufficient rainfall, the crops grew particularly vigorously. Therefore, in the new harvest year, the farmers are particularly happy. While harvesting, they are also preparing for next year's harvest. Farmers in some areas have already begun to divert water from the Lhasa River, preparing to irrigate and cultivate the fields after the harvest. Now in the Lhasa Plain, everywhere you can hear the Tibetan people's songs of gratitude to the People's Liberation Army: In past years, tears flowed endlessly, but this year, mountain songs cannot be sung enough. Our People's Liberation Army has come, and the dark clouds have been cleared away to reveal a clear sky.

### 拉萨平原大丰收

    拉萨平原大丰收
    九月的拉萨平原上，如果沿着碧绿的拉萨河岸走去，就会看到农民们和解放军的战士们如何紧张而愉快地在进行秋收。
    今年拉萨平原上，绝大部分地区的青稞和小麦的产量都比去年增加了一倍，这是西藏和平解放后第一个丰收的季节。
    拉萨附近各村的农民，都为庆祝丰收而狂欢。在九月十九日那天，很多村庄的农民用特有的民族形式开会庆祝丰收。东卡村也在这天举行了一次盛大的赛马会，村前旷场上搭着白色的大帐篷，帐篷前面插着各种青稞和小麦穗。附近各村都挑选出身长力大的农民，穿戴着祖国唐代武士的盔甲，背着弓箭，手执火枪，骑着装束后的骏马，来参加庆祝丰收大会的骑射大竞赛。笑容满面的男女藏民，也都穿着最好的衣服赶来参加。藏族农民还邀请了驻在附近的人民解放军参加盛会。这天，庆祝丰收的人群舞着、跳着，纵情地歌唱着。同时，人民解放军也组织了收割队，带着镰刀、炊具，到拉萨平原各村庄帮助农民进行秋收。拉萨市人民医院的医生，也带着各种药品下了乡，替害病的农民看病，保证在秋收期间，使有害病的农民家庭不因有病人而耽误秋收时间。
    解放以前，拉萨平原上的农民，因为在春耕时没有种籽，把好多田地都荒芜了。今年春天，拉萨平原上的农民得到进藏部队先遣支队政治部的无息贷放种籽后，土地荒芜的现象便大大减少了。人民解放军战士带头开荒生产，也大大地鼓舞了农民的生产热情。德庆地方的农民，今年还新开垦了一百多亩荒地。往年很少在田里施肥的人家，今年施肥量都增多了，再加上雨水充足，庄稼长得特别茁壮。因此，在新的丰收年里，农民们都表现得特别欢乐，他们一面收割，一面为第二年的丰收作准备。有些地区的农民已经开始从拉萨河引水，准备收割后就灌田耕地。现在拉萨平原上，到处可以听到藏民们感激人民解放军的歌声：往年眼泪流不尽，今年山歌唱不完，来了我们的解放军，拨开乌云见晴天。
