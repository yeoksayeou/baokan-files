    As a representative of the people of Burma, a country that suffered three years of fascist terror at the hands of the Japanese during the last war, we feel it is our duty to present to this conference the sentiments of the Burmese people on the Japanese question.

    First, Burma was drawn into the Second World War as a colonial country. The Japanese fascists invaded Burma and seized this colony from the hands of the British and American imperialists.

    The Burmese people learned from personal experience that the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" promoted by the Japanese fascists meant blood, sweat, and tears for the Burmese slaves, and arrogance, exploitation, and prosperity for the Japanese fascist masters. However, shortly before the Burmese delegation left Burma, some old-line Japanese fascists, now disguised as friendly neighbors under the leadership of Minami Jiro, came to Burma to visit, wooing former colleagues to relive the friendship of "co-prosperity" and even wanting to openly revive the slogan of the "Greater East Asia Zone." The Burmese people saw through them: they are not representatives of the Japanese people, but merely the running dogs of the American warmongers.

    They seem to have forgotten that the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" caused the Burmese people to lose half of their total national investment, which is about 1.75 billion rupees, and caused the Burmese people to lose countless lives.

    Secondly, during the period of Japanese fascist occupation, our entire economy, from the small fish paste industry to oil refineries, was seized by the Japanese fascists. But today, representatives of Japanese monopoly capitalists are pouring into Burma again, making sweet-sounding suggestions for Japanese and Burmese enterprises to operate jointly. Yoshida has already begun talking about Japanese technical assistance, wanting to replace the Truman Point Four Program, which has been rejected by the Burmese people.

    Thirdly, during the Japanese fascist occupation, the Burmese people completely lost their freedom. Everyone, except those employed by the fascist security forces, was subject to being drafted for forced labor at any time. More than 200,000 people lost their lives in the construction of the Burma-Siam Railway, the Burma-Arakan Highway, and other construction projects in sparsely populated malaria-ridden areas. There is not a single person or their immediate family who has not suffered physical abuse, rape, and plunder by the Japanese fascists.

    These are the sufferings that the Burmese people endured under the trampling of the Japanese fascist bandits in the past, and they also signify the danger of suffering recurring, this time even more severely.

    The Burmese people do not have any hatred or malice towards the Japanese people. When the Burmese people heard that the Japanese people were heroically opposing the American imperialist occupation like they did on May Day this year, and when they heard of the heroic Matsukawa Incident, their hearts turned towards the Japanese people, and they jointly opposed American imperialism with them. Similarly, when we heard the solemn, sincere, and lofty speeches of the representatives of the Japanese people at this conference, we further strengthened our determination to unite with the Japanese people to oppose American imperialist interference, occupation, and enslavement.

    We support the suggestions made by Mr. Guo Moruo and the Japanese representatives regarding the Japanese question.

    But we would also like to add a point: we hope that there can be more concrete ways of cooperation between the Japanese people and the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific region. The people of all countries in the world should use all possible means—whether it is sympathetic support movements or sending delegations—to connect with the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy. Only in this way can we effectively assist the heroic struggle of the Japanese people.

### 缅甸代表、克伦族大会副主席  苏波登关于日本问题的发言（摘要）

    缅甸代表、克伦族大会副主席
    苏波登关于日本问题的发言（摘要）
    在上次战争中，我国受日本法西斯恐怖的痛苦有三年之久，作为这个国家人民的代表，我们认为我们有责任把缅甸人民对日本问题的感想，提供给这个会议。
    首先，缅甸是作为一个殖民地国家被卷入第二次世界大战的。日本法西斯分子侵入缅甸，从英美帝国主义者手中抢夺了这块殖民地。
    缅甸人民从切身的经验中体会到：日本法西斯分子宣传的“大东亚共荣圈”，对缅甸的奴隶们意味着血汗与眼泪，对日本法西斯主子们，则意味着骄横、剥削与繁荣。但是，就在缅甸代表团离开缅甸前不久，一些日本老牌法西斯分子们，现在伪装做友善的邻居在南大佐率领之下，前来缅甸访问，拉拢昔日的同僚重温“共荣”的友谊，甚至想公开复活“大东亚地带”这个口号。缅甸人民看穿了：他们并不是日本人民的代表，只是美国战争贩子的走狗。
    他们想是忘记了“大东亚共荣圈”曾经使缅甸人民损失了国民投资总额的一半，那就是约十七亿五千万卢比，并且使缅甸人民丧失了无数生命。
    其次，在日本法西斯占领的时期中，我国的整个经济，从细小的鱼浆工业直到炼油厂，全被日本法西斯分子所攫夺。但是，今天日本垄断资本家的代表又涌入了缅甸，花言巧语地建议日本与缅甸的企业共同经营。吉田已经开始谈到日本的技术援助，想进而代替已被缅甸人民唾弃的杜鲁门第四点计划。
    第三，在日本法西斯占领时期，缅甸人民完全失去了自由。除了那些被法西斯警备队雇用的人之外，每个人随时都会被征去进行强迫劳动。有二十多万人就在修建缅甸——暹罗铁路、缅甸——阿拉干公路以及其他在人烟稀少的疟疾流行地区进行的建设工程中，丧失了生命。没有一个人或是他的直系亲属没有遭受过日本法西斯分子的肉体蹂躏、奸淫和掠夺的。
    这些就是过去缅甸人民在日本法西斯匪徒蹂躏下遭受到的痛苦，同时也意味着痛苦又有重新来临的危险，这一次甚至还要严重。
    缅甸人民对于日本人民并没有任何的憎恨和恶意，当缅甸人民听说日本人民像今年五一节那样英勇地反对美帝国主义的占领时，听见英雄的松川事件时，他们的心向着日本人民，和他们共同反对美帝国主义。同样，我们在这个会议中听到日本人民代表的严肃、真挚和崇高的发言时，我们更进一步加强了我们的决心和日本人民团结一致，反对美帝国主义的干涉、占领和奴役。
    我们支持郭沫若先生和日本代表所提出的关于日本问题的建议。
    但是我们还想作一点补充：我们希望日本人民和亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民间能有更为具体的合作方式。世界各国人民应该用一切可能的方法——不论是同情的支援运动或是派遣代表团，和日本人民争取独立、和平与民主的斗争联系起来。只有这样，我们才能有效地援助日本人民的英勇斗争。
