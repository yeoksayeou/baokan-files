The Evil Consequences of Truman Government's Mad Expansion of Military Production
The Stagnation of American Industrial Production Becomes Increasingly Obvious

[Report from this newspaper] American newspapers and magazines have recently published articles commenting on the American economic situation, acknowledging that a new and obvious state of stagnation has appeared in American industrial production. An article published by the American capitalist magazine "U.S. News & World Report" on September 5 acknowledged this fact in a worried tone.

On the one hand, this magazine talked about how military production plays a decisive role in the major industrial sectors of the United States, and is the "most solid (?!)" pillar "that will not be withdrawn suddenly" to "maintain corporate prosperity," and that this production "is approaching its peak." On the other hand, the magazine cannot help but immediately acknowledge that "there is a threat now," that is, "whether more and more sectors in industry have been dangerously over-expanded," because this "most expanded industry" may "experience any major reduction," and the result of the reduction will not only "greatly disappoint those industries that are expanding," but more sadly, it will "slow down the overall industrial expansion" and "draw away a giant pillar of American prosperity in sales, employment... and other aspects." The magazine also admitted that this threat is "a question that is happening in the minds of many entrepreneurs now." So, how much of the "possibility of threat" that the magazine said is reality? This magazine, which not long ago was overjoyed to clamor for the "unlimited prosperity" of the American economy, was forced to admit that even "some entrepreneurs, when looking to the future, see a slowdown in business." Because even now "there is no impetus to build new factories or purchase new equipment." Irrefutable facts forced the author of the article to sigh dejectedly: "Other sectors of post-war prosperity have also been frustrated." Finally, in circuitous and obscure tones, this magazine revealed a practical situation in American domestic economic life: "After the largest prosperity in history, the expansion of American enterprises is beginning to show signs of receding. In the plans of many large entrepreneurs, the cost of purchasing factories and equipment has suddenly formed a downward trend."

[Report from this newspaper] The American "Compass Daily" published an article by columnist Stone on September 21. This article, based on the report published by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, commented on the economic situations of the United States and some capitalist countries in Western Europe. The article published in the "Compass Daily" on September 21 stated: "The depressing report published by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe this week has global significance and contains clues pointing to the future of the world economy. Aside from jargon, this report, made by the most qualified economic experts in the world, says that if everything remains the same, Europe only simply has to choose a path between inflation and economic recession. In the simplest terms, the situation is this: The Western world is encountering a crisis of overproduction. It does not have the ability to absorb the means of production and consumer goods currently being produced. Even though a large portion of this production is produced for military purposes, it still cannot be absorbed."

The article traced back the situation before the outbreak of the Korean War and said: "Economists with various political views all agreed that economic recession was imminent in 1950. The specter of overproduction was about to be realized." But "the outbreak of the Korean War" made "the danger of economic recession disappear overnight. A huge rearmament plan made up for the sluggishness that began to occur in the economy. The following facts reflect the extent of the role this event played: The average annual new investment in new production capacity between 1950 and 1951 was about ten times the average annual investment in new production capacity between 1938 and 1945. But even more important in the long run than this is that the outbreak of the Korean War brought about a speculative frenzy, which led to a sharp rise in the prices of basic commodities. Speculators ran abroad to buy futures, firmly believing that a never-ending spiral (of rising prices) had begun."

The "Compass Daily" continued: "By January 1952, it was clear that the Korean War was unlikely to expand into a general conflict in the foreseeable future. As a result, prices began to fall in February this year. The situation today is that the lack of commodities has turned into a glut of commodities, oppressing the world market that cannot absorb it today. This result, of course, deepened the dollar shortage of our European allies and further disrupted the balance of trade. On top of these, we must now add the fact that we have reached a situation similar to that before the outbreak of the Korean War. It is now clear that military orders have absorbed, and will continue to absorb, a large portion of the results of the productive energy developed in the Western world over the past decade. But—and this is precisely the difficulty of the problem—the expansion of armaments cannot absorb all of it. In addition, the expansion of armaments has the effect of reducing the living standards of the people, thereby reducing their purchasing power, and in turn deepening their inability to absorb all the goods produced by this society. ... In other words, we are now encountering a crisis of overproduction again. In turn, this crisis of overproduction is further exacerbated by the fact that the United States strictly prohibits Western Europe from selling goods to the Soviet region of the world economy."

### 杜鲁门政府疯狂扩张军事生产的恶果  美国工业生产停滞情况愈益明显

    杜鲁门政府疯狂扩张军事生产的恶果
    美国工业生产停滞情况愈益明显
    【本报讯】美国的报纸和刊物最近发表了一些评论美国经济情况的专文，承认美国的工业生产又出现一种新的明显的停滞状态。美国大资本家的刊物“美国新闻与世界报道”于九月五日发表的一篇文章就是以忧虑的语调承认了这一事实的。
    这个杂志一方面谈到在美国的主要工业部门中，军事生产起着决定性的作用，而且是一根“不会在突然之间被抽掉”的“维持企业繁荣最坚固（？）的支柱”，而且这种生产“已经接近最高峰了”。另一方面，这个杂志不能不立刻承认“现在还有一种威胁”，这种威胁就是“在工业是否有愈来愈多的部门已经危险地过分扩张了”，因为这种“扩张最大的工业”可能“发生任何重大的缩减”，而缩减的结果不仅会使“那些正在扩张的工业大为扫兴”，而更伤心的是它将使“工业扩张全盘减缓”，就会“抽去一根美国在售货、就业……和其他方面繁荣的巨柱”。这个杂志并且承认，这种威胁是“许多企业家心中现在发生的问题”。那末，杂志所说的“威胁的可能性”究竟有多少是现实呢？这个在不久前曾经为美国经济“无限繁荣”而得意忘形喧嚷过的杂志被迫承认，甚至“有些企业家在展望未来时，他们所看到的是企业方面的减缓。”因为甚至在现在“并没有建造新工厂或购置新设备的推动力”。推不倒的事实，迫使该文作者垂头丧气地叹道：“战后繁荣的其他部门也已经受到挫折了”。最后，在转弯抹角和种种隐晦的笔调中，这个杂志道出了美国国内经济生活的一个实际情况：“美国企业的扩张在经过历史上最大一次的繁荣之后，正开始露出消退的征候来。在许多大企业家的计划中，购置工厂和设备的费用突然形成下降之势。”
    【本报讯】九月二十一日的美国“指南针日报”刊载了专栏作家史东的文章，这篇文章以联合国欧洲经济委员会公布的报告为基础，评述了美国以及西欧一些资本主义国家的经济局势。“指南针日报”九月二十一日刊载的专文称：“联合国欧洲经济委员会本星期公布的那个令人沮丧的报告，具有世界性的意义，并含有指出世界经济前途的线索。撇开专门术语来讲，这一个全世界最有资格的经济专家们所做的报告中说，如果一切情况不变，欧洲只有在通货膨胀和经济萎缩之间简单地选择一条路。化为最简单的话，情形就是这样：西方世界遇到了一个生产过剩的危机。它没有能力吸收目前所生产出来的生产工具和消费品。尽管这个生产量中有一大部分是为了军备目的而生产的，它还是不能吸收。”
    该文追述了朝鲜战争爆发前的情况说：“抱有各种不同的政治见解的经济学家们都一致认为一九五○年时经济萎缩已迫于眉睫。生产过剩的魅影快要实现了。”但是“朝鲜战争的爆发”使得“经济萎缩的危险一夜之间消失了。一个巨大的重整军备计划，弥补了经济中开始发生的迟滞现象。下列事实反映了这事所起作用的程度：一九五○及一九五一年间投向新生产能力的每年平均新投资额，大约达于一九三八至一九四五年间新生产能力每年平均投资额的十倍。但是从长期看来甚至比这点更为重要的是，朝鲜战争的爆发带来了一番投机的狂热，以致引起了基本商品价格的狂涨。投机家们跑到国外去购买期货，坚决地相信一次永不完结的螺旋式（价格上升）已经开始了。”
    “指南针日报”接着说：“到一九五二年一月时已经很明显，朝鲜战争在看得见的将来大概不会扩大为一般的冲突。其结果，今年二月物价开始降低。今天的情况是，商品缺乏已经变成了商品充斥，压迫着今天还不能够把它吸收的世界市场。这结果当然加深了我们欧洲盟友的美元荒，并且更进一步地扰乱了贸易的平衡。在这些上面现在必须加上这个事实：我们又达到了类似朝鲜战争爆发之前的情况。现在已经明白，军备的订货过去曾吸收、并且将继续吸收西方世界过去十年中发展的生产能量之成果的一大部分。但是——这而且正是问题的困难之处——扩军并不能吸收其全部。此外，扩军会发生减低本国人民生活水准的影响，因此，降低了他们的购买力，转而更加深了他们的无力吸收这个社会所生产的全部商品。……换句话说，我们现在又遇到了生产过剩的危机。转过来，这个生产过剩的危机，因为美国严格禁止，使得西欧不可能售货给世界经济中的苏联地区而更加尖锐化了。”
