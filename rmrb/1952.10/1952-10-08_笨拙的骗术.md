    Clumsy Trickery
    Li Gao
    This spring, when the American aggressors' crime of using bacteriological weapons was first exposed, the defenders of the American bacteriological warfare criminals still pretended to "refute" the evidence presented by the Chinese and Korean people. For example, a New York dispatch from the US News Agency on April 3rd quoted "the famous Dr. Du Bois" as saying that "none of the bacteria mentioned by the Communist newspapers can be carried on insects." The next day, "Voice of America" broadcast that "the head of the Entomology and Arachnid Department of the American Museum of Natural History, Mr. Curran, claimed that these photos (referring to the photos published in the People's Daily on March 15th) were distorted photos of harmless insects." Unfortunately, bacteriology, entomology, infectious diseases, etc., are not "exclusive" "secrets" of the United States. Recently, after the publication of the report of the International Scientific Commission investigating bacteriological warfare in Korea and China, facing this ironclad evidence, the US government, apart from issuing a few "die-hard denial" statements from the US State Department and the Secretary of Defense, has remained silent. The Du Bois's have also disappeared. However,
    "The New York Times" and some of its followers have adopted another approach, desperately launching personal attacks on the scientists of the International Scientific Commission, accusing them of being disloyal to "the group accused by the Communists of using bacteriological weapons."
    Even more unfortunately, when people around the world look at the scientists' testimony, they only require them to be loyal to the facts and loyal to science.
    The futility of empty denials and personal attacks has made some accomplices eager to curry favor with their American masters anxious. They had to muster the courage of Don Quixote attacking windmills and come out to "refute" the content of the International Scientific Commission's report. This is the British "Daily Telegraph." The gentlemen of this newspaper know that there is no way to "argue," so they have to resort to a clumsy and vile trick. They conceal over ninety percent of the content of the International Scientific Commission's report from their readers, and then use thick ink to alter and add to the little bit they leave behind according to their own ideas, and then publish it in their own newspaper and sternly "refute" it, saying: "Look, this is the report of the International Scientific Commission, how absurd this report is!"
    Please take a look at the "Daily Telegraph's" distorted description of the Daedong incident in the International Scientific Commission's report on September 22nd:
    "On the night of May 16th, farmers in Daedong County heard an airplane flying overhead. They suspected it was an American plane. The next morning, several of them ate clams and later contracted cholera. They suspected that they contracted cholera because they ate these clams. They suspected that these clams were contaminated with cholera bacteria because the foreign devils put cholera bacteria in them. The foreign devils loaded clams into airplanes and then dropped the clams in Daedong County at night."
    Then, the "Daily Telegraph" said that the International Scientific Commission came to its conclusions by "solemnly listening to these nonsense."
    Everyone may wish to compare this quote from the "Daily Telegraph" with the original text of the International Scientific Commission's report to see what similarities there are between the two, and who is actually talking "nonsense." The defenders of the American bacteriological warfare criminals are extremely bored. They concealed all the ironclad testimonies, physical evidence, medical evidence, bacteriological examination results, and scientific judgments regarding the Daedong incident mentioned in the original text and attachments of the International Scientific Commission's report, and replaced it with a few "nonsense" sentences fabricated by themselves, plus a series of "they suspected." They thought that this would "defeat" the report!
    On the same day, the "Daily Telegraph" also announced that the International Scientific Commission believed the confessions of Inak, Quinn, O'Neill, Kness, and other four American Air Force prisoners of war, but "these confessions are self-contradictory."
    Where are the "contradictions"? Let's take an example to see the tactics of the defenders of the American bacteriological warfare criminals!
    According to the "Daily Telegraph," "Inak clearly contradicts himself" because Inak said on one page of his confession that he had only seen bacteriological bombs at night, but on another page he drew an unusually clear diagram of a bacteriological bomb. Isn't this self-contradictory?
    As long as people open Inak's confession, they will know that Inak had already explained clearly: he had listened to a secret lesson at 1:00 pm on August 25, 1951, "the main part of the lesson was dedicated to explaining the weapons used in bacteriological warfare." What is so strange about an American Air Force lieutenant who has listened to a course specifically explaining bacteriological weapons and has personally dropped bacteriological bombs twice drawing a simple diagram of a bacteriological bomb? The "Daily Telegraph" completely concealed the part of Inak's confession about attending the course and extracted the few sentences in which Inak stated that he first saw a bacteriological bomb at night to "prove" that his confession was "contradictory." This kind of deception is really "brilliant"!
    This kind of trick adopted by the British "Daily Telegraph" when defending its American masters is not new in the United States. On May 7th this year, the American "International News Service" used the same method to deal with the confession of American Air Force prisoner of war Quinn. It secretly changed the time when Quinn admitted to attending a bacteriological warfare course in Korea last December in the confession to
    "August" (when Quinn was still in the United States) to "prove" the "absurdity" of Quinn's confession.
    This trick of the American "International News Service" has long been exposed. The pitiful "Daily Telegraph" did not learn its lesson and stumbled in its footsteps. It originally wanted to clear the charges for its American masters, but the result was as the saying goes: "Washing a mud Buddha - the more you wash, the dirtier it gets."
    The defenders of the American bacteriological warfare criminals may have their own plans. They estimate that it is difficult for people in the United States, Britain, and many other countries to read the original text of the International Scientific Commission's report. Therefore, their empty denials and clumsy tricks can always play a deceptive role among some people. Therefore, we call on all people who love peace and the future of mankind to not only read the International Scientific Commission's report for themselves, but also to tell everyone the true content of the report. The dignity of science must not be damaged by these despicable and vile methods used by American bacteriological warfare criminals and their defenders.

    笨拙的骗术
    李高
    今年春天，美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行刚被揭露出来的时候，美国细菌战犯的辩护者们对于中、朝两国人民提出来的证据，还装出要“辩驳”一番的架势。比如，美国新闻处四月三日纽约电引用美国“著名的杜波斯博士”的话说：“共产党报纸”“所说的细菌没有那一种可以带在昆虫身上”。第二天，“美国之音”又广播说：“美国自然历史博物馆昆虫蜘蛛室主任寇兰称，这些照片（指人民日报三月十五日发表的照片）是被歪曲了的无害昆虫的照片。”可惜得很，细菌学、昆虫学、传染病学等等，都不是美国“独有”的“秘密”。最近，调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战国际科学委员会的报告书发表以后，面对着这铁的证据，美国政府除了让美国国务院和国防部长发表了几句“死不认账”的声明以外，再也不开腔了，杜波斯们也消声匿迹了。不过
    “纽约时报”和它的一些追随者则另外采取了一种手法，拼命地向国际科学委员会的科学家们进行人身攻击，斥责他们不忠于“被共产党指责使用细菌武器的集团”。
    更可惜，全世界人民来看科学家的见证时，却只要求他们忠于事实、忠于科学。
    空口否认和人身攻击的徒劳无效，使某些急于在自己的美国主子跟前邀功的帮凶着急起来了。他们不得不鼓起唐·吉诃德先生攻打水车的勇气，出来“驳斥”国际科学委员会报告书的内容。这就是英国“每日电讯报”。这个报纸的先生们知道，“辩”是没有办法“辩”的，他们只好乞灵于一种笨拙、下流的骗术。他们把国际科学委员会报告书内容的百分之九十几向他们的读者隐瞒起来，留下的一点点则用浓墨大笔，按自己的意思把它涂改、增添一通，然后登到自己的报上严加“驳斥”道：“你们看，这就是国际科学委员会的报告书，这报告书多荒谬啊！”
    请看看九月二十二日“每日电讯报”歪曲国际科学委员会报告书里关于大同事件的一段叙述：
    “五月十六日夜间，大同郡的农民听见一架飞机在上空飞行。他们猜想这是一架美国飞机。第二天早晨，其中有几个人吃了蛤蜊，后来就得了霍乱病。他们猜想，他们之得霍乱病，是因为吃了这些蛤蜊。他们猜想，这些蛤蜊之所以会染上霍乱菌，那是因为洋鬼子把霍乱菌放进去的缘故。外国鬼子把蛤蜊装入飞机，然后在夜间把蛤蜊投在大同郡。”
    接着，“每日电讯报”说，国际科学委员会就是“一本正经地聆听这些胡说”而作出结论的。
    大家不妨把“每日电讯报”这段引述和国际科学委员会报告书的原文对照着读一下，看看这两者之间究竟有什么相同之处，究竟是谁在说“胡话”。美国细菌战犯的辩护者无聊透顶，他们把国际科学委员会报告书的原文和附件所说的关于大同事件的铁一样的人证、物证、医学的证据、细菌学检查结果和科学的判断等等通通隐瞒掉，而换上自己诌出来的几句“胡话”，再加上一连几个“他们猜想”。他们以为这样就把报告书“打倒”了！
    “每日电讯报”同一天又宣布说：国际科学委员会相信伊纳克、奎恩、奥尼尔、克尼斯等四个美国空军战俘的供词，而“这些供词是自相矛盾”的。
    “矛盾”在什么地方呢？我们举个例子来看看美国细菌战犯的辩护者的手法吧！
    据“每日电讯报”说，“伊纳克明显地跟他自己矛盾”，因为伊纳克在供词的一页上说，他只在黑夜里看见过细菌弹，可是在另一页上他又画出了一张异常清楚的细菌弹图样。这不是自相矛盾吗？
    人们只要打开伊纳克的供词，就知道伊纳克早就交代清楚了：他在一九五一年八月二十五日下午一时听过一次秘密课，“课程的主要部分是专门讲解细菌战所用的武器”。一个听过专门讲解细菌武器的课程而且亲手投过两次细菌弹的美国空军中尉，画出一张简单的细菌弹图样有什么奇怪呢？“每日电讯报”把伊纳克供词中关于听课这一段完全隐瞒掉，而摘出伊纳克说明他头一次看见细菌弹是在夜里的那几句话来“证明”他的供词“矛盾”。这种障眼法真是“高明”呵！
    英国“每日电讯报”给美国主子辩护时采取的这种骗术，在美国来说本已不算新奇。今年五月七日，美国“国际新闻社”就采用过同样的办法来对付美国空军战俘奎恩供词。它把供词里奎恩承认去年十二月在朝鲜听了一次细菌课的时间偷偷地改为
    “八月”（那时奎恩还在美国），用来“证明”奎恩供词的“荒谬”。
    美国“国际新闻社”这套骗术早被揭穿了。可怜的“每日电讯报”竟没有接受教训，踩着它的脚后跟摔交。它本想给自己的美国主子洗刷一下罪责，结果弄成像俗语所说的：“泥菩萨洗澡——越洗越脏”。
    美国细菌战犯的辩护者们也许有他们的打算，他们估计在美国、英国以及其他许多国家里，人们是很难读到国际科学委员会的报告书的原文的。所以他们的空口否认和笨拙骗术，总可以在一部分人中间起些欺骗作用。因此，我们呼吁所有热爱和平、热爱人类前途的人们，不独要自己去读读国际科学委员会的报告书，而且要把报告书的真实内容告诉所有的人。科学的尊严，决不能让美国细菌战犯和他们的辩护者用这些卑鄙、下流的方法来损毁。
