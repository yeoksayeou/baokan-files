What is the origin of the so-called "Six Codes"?
Shi Ban

Chinese old law has a history of thousands of years. Starting from the six chapters of the *Fa Jing* written by Li Kui of the Warring States period, successive feudal dynasties have formulated laws, such as the Han Law, the Laws of the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, the Sui Law, the Tang Law, the Song Xing Tong, the Yuan Dian Zhang, the Ming Law, the Qing Law, and even the Kuomintang's "Six Codes". For two thousand years, they have been passed down in one continuous line, all weapons for the reactionary ruling class to suppress and bind the broad masses of people. What we call the old legal viewpoint is the general term for anti-people legal viewpoints, and it is represented by the reactionary Kuomintang's "Six Codes". The "Six Codes" is a name adopted from Japan, including laws such as the Constitution, Criminal Law, Civil Law, Commercial Law, Procedural Law (Criminal Procedure Law and Civil Procedure Law), and Court Organization Law (another saying is to list Criminal Procedure Law and Civil Procedure Law separately, and remove the Court Organization Law, calling it the Six Codes).

The Kuomintang's reactionary laws mainly consist of two parts: the first part is statutory law, or written law, mainly the "Six Codes" formulated by the Kuomintang reactionaries.

(1) Constitution: In the late Qing Dynasty, "Constitutional Outline" and "Nineteen Articles" were promulgated, but they collapsed before they could be implemented. After the Xinhai Revolution, the Nanjing Provisional Government promulgated the "Provisional Constitution". Later, Yuan Shikai stole power and conspired to become emperor, and promulgated the "New Covenant Law". In between, there was also the "Temple of Heaven Constitution Draft" drafted by the old National Assembly. In 1923, Cao Kun, a warlord of the Northern Warlords, bribed his way to the presidency and promulgated another "Cao Kun Constitution". During the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, the "Political Program During the Period of Tutelage," the "Organic Law of the National Government," and the "Covenant Law During the Period of Tutelage" were successively promulgated. The characteristic of this "Covenant Law" was to legalize the Kuomintang reactionaries' dictatorial autocracy, emphasize anti-revolutionary centralism, have the Kuomintang represent the National Assembly to exercise "political power," and have the Kuomintang reactionaries take overall control of national "governance power," implementing a one-party dictatorship. In May 1937, the "May 5th Constitution Draft" was also announced, but it was not implemented. On the eve of the collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, a puppet National Assembly was convened to formulate a constitution for their own purposes. This constitution was drafted by reactionary leaders such as Zhang Junmai and adopted a dictatorial presidential system, which was a completely fascist version.

(2) Criminal Law: In the feudal ruling era of China, all laws were called criminal law, which also included some civil clauses or cases. Its characteristic was to protect landlords, suppress peasants, maintain feudal ethics, and impose very cruel punishments. In the late Qing Dynasty, on the one hand, Shen Jiaben, Wu Tingfang, and others revised the old laws and promulgated the "Current Criminal Law"; on the other hand, they hired Japanese Okada Asataro, Matsuoka Yoshimasa, and others to draft the "New Criminal Law". Later, the "Provisional New Criminal Law" announced by Yuan Shikai was this draft. It was implemented for seventeen years until the collapse of the Northern Warlord rule. The Kuomintang reactionary government promulgated the Criminal Law in 1928. The main content was to absorb the criminal law principles of capitalist countries such as Japan, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland to rule the people, while retaining the feudal system. For example: a married woman who commits adultery is to be sentenced, while a married man who commits adultery is not punished, allowing men to arbitrarily play with women. This is a complete male chauvinist viewpoint. What is even more prominent is the cruel suppression and massacre of revolutionary people. Especially the new criminal law promulgated in 1935, which contains a strong fascist content. The most significant is the chapter on "Security Measures," which is a cruel criminal law used to suppress people of all classes who resist reactionary rule, beyond the general criminal law. In the past, fascist countries such as Germany and Italy widely used this "security measure" and massacred millions of anti-fascist people. In several states in the United States, according to security procedures, "criminals" are subjected to inhuman "disinfection measures." The Kuomintang reactionaries are precisely inheriting the mantle of Hitler, Mussolini, and American imperialism. In addition, the Kuomintang reactionaries further formulated many special criminal laws and orders, such as the "Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Against the Republic of China," the "Provisional Measures for Trying Bandit Cases During the Bandit Suppression Period," the "Regulations on Reformatories" (during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War), as well as the "Measures to Prevent the Activities of Dissident Party Members" (during the Anti-Japanese War), the "Regulations for Suppression of Rebellion," the "Organic Regulations of Special Criminal Courts" (during the Third Domestic Revolutionary War), etc., all of which adopted fascist barbaric means to cruelly suppress the people and maintain their reactionary rule.

(3) Civil Law: In the feudal era of China, due to the "integration of all laws," there was no independent civil law, only mixed in the criminal law, and there were not many clauses. In the late Qing Dynasty, the Japanese Matsuoka was hired to draft the "Civil Law," and the draft was completed in the Xinhai year. It is divided into five parts: General Principles, Obligation, Real Rights, Family, and Inheritance. Part of it is copied from the codes of capitalist countries, and part of it follows the old system of the feudal dynasties. During the rule of the Northern Warlords, the Frenchman Escarra was hired to participate in the compilation of the "Civil Law Draft," but it was not promulgated. At that time, judges handled cases by citing some clauses related to marriage and money debts in the Qing Criminal Law, and also used the civil laws of Japan, Germany, and other countries as reference and supplement, which was called jurisprudence. The Kuomintang reactionary government successively promulgated the entire Civil Law from 1929 to 1931, also divided into five parts, which was drafted based on the "Civil Law Draft" compiled by the Northern Warlord government with some deletions and revisions. It mainly copied the revised civil laws of capitalist countries such as Switzerland and Germany, but still retained some feudal things. Among them, the two chapters on perpetual tenancy and dianyed rights in the Real Rights part are to protect the land ownership of the landlord class. In the Family part, there are strict restrictions on marriage between men and women, for example, marriage with an adulterer is not allowed, and relatives within five degrees of kinship with hierarchical distinctions are not allowed to marry; there are differences between illegitimate and legitimate children, and the property of husband and wife favors the husband's management rights and disposal rights; provisions such as family conferences are inherited from feudal clanism; and the General Principles and Obligation parts are copied from the codes of capitalist countries.

(4) Commercial Law: China's commercial law began in the late Qing Dynasty, drafted by Wu Tingfang, and later promulgated three types: General Rules for Merchants, Company Law, and Bankruptcy Law. The content generally adopts the legal system of the United Kingdom and its colonies. During the rule of the Northern Warlords, it was revised and some Japanese commercial law clauses were incorporated. The Kuomintang reactionary government successively promulgated four types: Company Law, Negotiable Instruments Law, Maritime Law, and Insurance Law, as well as Commercial Registration Law, Trademark Law, Banking Law, Exchange Law, and Bankruptcy Law. All of these were to facilitate the economic aggression of imperialism and the monopoly of bureaucratic bourgeoisie. For example, allowing imperialist countries to establish companies in China, invest in Chinese companies to participate in business, and purchase land and build factories in China are all open protections of imperialist economic aggression in China. In addition, there are regulations on the management of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce during extraordinary periods, and monopoly regulations on tobacco and alcohol and salt, which are tools to help the four major families monopolize, cruelly exploit the people, and oppress the Chinese national bourgeoisie.

(5) Procedural Law: China's procedural procedures in the feudal era were scattered in the criminal law and were not very complete. Its characteristic was arbitrary, dictatorial, dark, and cruel. For example, torture to extract confessions was a very common phenomenon. In the late Qing Dynasty, a "Trial Regulations for Trial Courts at All Levels" was promulgated, and later the Japanese Okada and Matsuoka were invited to draft the "Criminal Procedure Law" and "Civil Procedure Law". During the rule of the Northern Warlords, the "Criminal Procedure Regulations" and "Civil Procedure Regulations" were promulgated, completely imitating the procedural procedures of Japan and Germany at that time. The Kuomintang reactionary government promulgated the "Criminal Procedure Law" and "Civil Procedure Law" several times. The "Criminal Procedure Law" of 1928 and the "Civil Procedure Law" of 1932 were based on the above two regulations, with some revisions. In 1935 and 1945, the "Criminal Procedure Law" and "Civil Procedure Law" were revised and re-promulgated, but basically there were no changes. For example, there are many kinds of provisions on the jurisdiction of cases in the "Civil Procedure Law," the most prominent of which is the so-called "exclusive jurisdiction". Regarding marriage cases, the woman must file a lawsuit in the man's place of residence. Another example is that the "Criminal Procedure Law" stipulates that incidental civil matters must meet certain conditions; but during the civil procedure, it is absolutely not allowed to have incidental criminal matters. The characteristics of these procedural laws are complicated procedures, which are convenient for restricting and ruling the people.

(6) Court Organization Law: In the feudal ruling period in China, cases were mostly judged by county officials, and there was no court organization. In the late Qing Dynasty, it was necessary to "change the law and reform" to deceive the people, establish trial courts and prosecutor's offices, and promulgate the Court Organization Law, adopting a four-level and three-trial system. The Northern Warlord government still used it, and the Kuomintang reactionary rule did not change it in the early days. In 1935, the "Court Organization Law" was promulgated, and it was slightly revised and re-promulgated in 1946. Except for the change to a three-level and three-trial system, there was not much change. This law was also copied from the codes of capitalist countries (mainly Japan and Germany). In order to deceive the people, it hypocritically emphasized "judicial independence," the opposition between prosecution and trial, and detailed internal division of labor. Later, special criminal courts were specially established to handle so-called "political prisoner" cases, which were presided over by more reactionary secret agents to cruelly suppress the people.

The second component of the Kuomintang reactionary government's law is the "precedents" and "interpretations" of the pseudo-courts.

In the imperialist countries of the United States and Britain, the so-called "common law" is generally applied. The source of this law is the "judgment precedents" of the court on specific cases. These precedents are used as the basis for future judgments of similar cases. This method has not only been preserved in the United States and Britain for a long time, but has also been happily adopted by the reactionary ruling classes of other countries. Using "precedents" can arbitrarily embody the intention of reactionary rule, and it is more convenient to be arbitrary and do whatever one wants. The role of "interpretations" is also the same. It can be mechanically interpreted according to the will of the reactionary rulers, or it can be expanded. For example, private executions of blacks often occur in some states in the United States, but they can be free from legal sanctions. According to the interpretation of their jurists, they believe that: "When the fixed occasions in the legal norms are not suitable for social daily life, it is possible to use considerable common sense within the scope of tradition (the common law of the United States and Britain is based on traditional customs) and allow the judge to freely exercise discretion." The reason why the number of "judgment precedents" and "interpretations" made by the pseudo-Beiyang warlord government's Dali Yuan and even the Kuomintang reactionary ruling period courts is very large, several times more than the promulgated legal provisions, is precisely this. For example, the pseudo-Dali Yuan has such an interpretation example: "After the owner has effectively revoked the tenancy, if the tenant pays off the rent arrears, the tenancy cannot be restored without the owner's consent." (Tongzi No. 1232) This is obviously an interpretation example to protect landlords and oppress peasants. Another example is the interpretation example of the Kuomintang pseudo-Supreme Court saying: "Although concubines are not stipulated by the Civil Law, the concubine and the head of the family have the purpose of permanent cohabitation (omitted), and should be regarded as family members." (Shangzi No. 107) This is to recognize the legality of men taking concubines. There is a judgment example that says: "If a wife is abused by the direct relatives of her husband, causing her to be unable to live together, although she may request a divorce, the so-called abuse must be based on facts that are objectively sufficient to confirm that there are indeed circumstances under which they cannot live together before a divorce can be granted." (Shangzi No. 762) This is to restrict the freedom of women to divorce, and to regard the abuse of women as not necessarily a reason for divorce, in order to protect the feudal patriarchal rule and suppress and persecute women. Another example is that the pseudo-Supreme Court once interpreted: "Communist Party cases should be convicted of counter-revolution." (Jiezi No. 16) On September 5, 1931, the pseudo-Executive Yuan issued an instruction: "The Provisional Regulations for Punishing Bandits in the Bandit Suppression Area and the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Against the Republic of China are allowed to be used with variations." Such things show that the precedents and interpretations of the pseudo-courts are nothing more than clever supplements and arbitrary expansions of anti-people laws, all for the purpose of protecting their reactionary rule.

From the historical facts of the old Chinese law mentioned above, since the Zhou and Qin Dynasties, because the laws of all dynasties have always been tools for the reactionary ruling class to oppress the people, so for a common purpose—oppressing the people—this dynasty can use or copy the laws of that dynasty. The Kuomintang's reactionary laws also copied the laws of fascist countries. Therefore, the Kuomintang's reactionary "Six Codes" has three sources: one is to inherit the laws and decrees of the feudal dynasties and the Northern Warlord period, which is basically a feudal reactionary legal system; the second is to transport many legal clauses of capitalist countries that deceive and oppress the people; and the third is to absorb the laws and decrees of fascist countries such as Germany, Japan, and Italy. It can be seen that the "Six Codes" is the culmination of feudal, comprador, and fascist reactionary legal thought. Therefore, the "Six Codes" and all laws, decrees, and judicial systems of the Kuomintang reactionaries are oppressive to the people, thoroughly reactionary, and fundamentally contrary to the people's legal principles of New China, and must be completely destroyed. Therefore, the movement against old legal viewpoints that we are now carrying out is not just against the specific provisions of the Kuomintang's "Six Codes," but against all reactionary legal thoughts and judicial systems.

    所谓“六法全书”是什么来历
    施班
    中国旧法已有数千年的历史。远自战国李悝所写法经六篇开始，历代封建王朝都订有法律，如汉律、魏晋六朝律、隋律、唐律、宋刑统、元典章、明律、清律、以至国民党的“六法全书”。两千年来一脉相传，都是反动统治阶级镇压与束缚广大人民的武器。我们所称旧法观点，即是反人民的法律观点的总称，而又以反动的国民党“六法全书”为代表。“六法全书”是沿用日本的名称，其中包括宪法、刑法、民法、商法、诉讼法（刑事诉讼法和民事诉讼法）、法院组织法等法律（另有一说，把刑事诉讼法和民事诉讼法分列，除去法院组织法，称为六法）。
    国民党的反动法律，主要有两个组成部分：第一个部分是制定法或叫成文法，主要是国民党反动派所制定的“六法全书”。
    （1）宪法：满清末季曾颁布“宪法大纲”和“十九信条”，未及施行即垮台。辛亥革命后，南京临时政府颁行过“临时约法”。后来袁世凯窃夺政权，阴谋称帝，又颁布“新约法”。中间还有旧国会拟成的“天坛宪法草案”。到一九二三年，北洋军阀曹锟贿选总统，又颁布一次“曹锟宪法”。国民党反动统治时期先后颁行“训政时期施政纲领”、“国民政府组织法”及“训政时期约法”。这个“约法”的特点是使国民党反动派的独裁专制合法化，强调反革命的中央集权，由国民党代表国民大会行使“政权”，由国民党反动派总揽国家“治权”，实行一党专政。一九三七年五月还宣布过“五五宪草”，未施行。到蒋匪帮崩溃前夕，又召开伪国民大会，制定御用宪法。这个宪法是由反动头子张君劢等起草，采取独裁式总统制，完全是法西斯化的版本。
    （2）刑法：中国在封建统治时代，所有法律都叫刑法，其中也夹杂着一些民事性质的条款或案例。它的特征是保护地主，镇压农民，维护封建伦常，处刑非常残酷。满清末年，一面由沈家本、伍廷芳等删改旧法律，颁行“现行刑律”；一面聘请日本人冈田朝太郎、松冈义正等起草“新刑律”。后来袁世凯宣布援用的“暂行新刑律”，就是这个草案。施行十七年，直到北洋军阀统治崩溃。国民党反动政权于一九二八年颁行刑法，主要内容是吸取日、德、奥、瑞士等资本主义国家统治人民的刑法原则，同时保留着封建制度体系。例如：对于有夫之妇与人通奸要判刑，而对于已结婚的丈夫与人通奸则不处罚，使男子可以任意玩弄女性，这是十足的男尊女卑观点。更突出的是残酷地镇压与屠杀革命人民。尤其是一九三五年颁行的新刑法，其中含有浓厚的法西斯蒂的内容。最显著的如“保安处分”
    一章，这是超越于一般刑法以上，用来镇压反抗反动统治的各阶级人民的一种残酷刑法。过去，德、意等法西斯国家就曾广泛利用这种“保安处分”，屠杀了上百万的反法西斯的人民。而在美国的几个州内，依保安程序，“犯罪人”竟遭受到非人道的
    “消毒处分”。国民党反动派正是继承了希特勒、墨索里尼以及美帝国主义的衣钵。此外，国民党反动派还进一步制订了好多特别刑事法令，如“危害民国紧急治罪法”，“剿匪期内审理盗匪案件暂行办法”，“反省院条例”等（第二次国内革命战争时期），以及“防止异党分子活动办法”（抗日战争时期），“戡乱条例”，“特种刑事法庭组织条例”（第三次国内革命战争时期）等等，都是采用法西斯的野蛮手段来残酷地镇压人民、维护其反动统治的。
    （3）民法：中国封建时代由于“诸法合体”，没有独立的民法，只夹杂在刑律里面，条款也不多，满清末年，聘日本人松冈起草“民律”，辛亥年完成草案。内分总则、债权、物权、亲属、继承五编。部分是抄袭资本主义国家的法典，部分是沿袭封建王朝的旧制。北洋军阀统治时期，曾聘法国人爱斯加拉参加编订“民法草案”，但没有颁布。当时法官办案是援用满清刑律里面一些有关婚姻、钱债的条款，又把日、德等国的民法作为参考和补充，叫做法理。国民党反动政府于一九二九年至一九三一年间先后颁行全部民法，也是分列五编，这是根据北洋军阀政府所编的“民法草案”加以删改而拟订的。主要是抄袭了瑞士、德国等资本主义国家的修正民法，但仍保留着若干封建的东西。其中物权编内永佃权、典权二章，即是为了保护地主阶级的土地所有权。亲属编内，男女间婚姻有严格限制，例如不得与相奸者结婚，姻亲在五亲等内有尊卑名分的不得结婚等；非婚生子与婚生子有差别，夫妻的财产偏重夫的管理权、处分权；亲属会议等等规定，都是承继封建宗法主义的；而总则和债编则是抄袭了资本主义国家的法典。
    （4）商法：中国有商法，是从满清末季开始，由伍廷芳起草商律，后颁行商人通例、公司律、破产律三种。内容大体上是采用英国和其殖民地的法制。北洋军阀统治时期又加以修改，渗入些日本商法条文。国民党反动政权先后颁布了公司法、票据法、海商法、保险法四种，另外还有商业登记法、商标法、银行法、交易所法、破产法。所有这些都是为了便于帝国主义的经济侵略和官僚资产阶级的垄断独占。如准许帝国主义国家在中国设立公司，投资于中国公司参加业务，可以在中国购买土地、建筑厂房等规定，都是公开保护帝国主义在中国的经济侵略的。此外，还有非常时期管理农矿工商条例，烟酒专卖、食盐专卖条例种种，更是帮助四大家族垄断独占，残酷剥削人民，压迫中国民族资产阶级的工具。
    （5）诉讼法：中国封建时代的诉讼程序散见于刑律中，不大完备。它的特征是专横武断，黑暗残酷。如刑讯逼供是极普遍的现象。满清末季颁行一个“各级审判厅试办章程”，后又请日本人冈田、松冈起草“刑事诉讼律”、“民事诉讼律”。北洋军阀统治时期颁行了“刑诉条例”、“民诉条例”两种，完全是仿效日本、德国当时的诉讼程序。国民党反动政权曾数次颁行“刑事诉讼法”和“民事诉讼法”。一九二八年的“刑诉法”和一九三二年的“民诉法”，都是以上述两种条例为蓝本，酌加修改而成。一九三五年和一九四五年又将“刑诉法”和“民诉法”修正后重新颁布，但基本上没有变动。如“民事诉讼法”中关于案件管辖的规定有好多种，最突出的是所谓“专属管辖”。关于婚姻案件，女方一定要到男方住地起诉。又如“刑事诉讼法”中规定附带民事要具备一定条件；但民事诉讼进行中，则绝对不许附带刑事。这些诉讼法的特点，是程序烦琐，便于束缚和统治人民。
    （6）法院组织法：中国在封建统治时期，多由县官判案，没有法院组织。清朝末季要“变法维新”，欺骗人民，建立审判厅，检察厅，颁布了法院编制法，采取四级三审制。北洋军阀政府仍旧沿用，国民党反动统治初期也没有改变。到一九三五年颁行“法院组织法”，一九四六年略加修改又重新颁布，除改为三级三审制外，也没有多大变动。这个法也是从资本主义国家（主要是日、德两国）的法典抄袭来的。它为了欺骗人民，虚伪地强调“审判独立”，审、检对立和内部细密分工。以后更专设特别刑事法庭，专办所谓“政治犯”案件，由更反动的特务分子主持，残酷地镇压人民。
    国民党反动政府的法律的第二个组成部分，是伪法院的“判例”和“解释例”。
    在美、英帝国主义国家，普遍适用的是所谓“成例法”。这种法的来源，是法院对具体案件的“判决例”。以这些判例作为以后判决类似案件的依据。这种办法不但在美、英两国长时期地保存着，而且也为其他国家的反动统治阶级所乐于采用。用“判例”能随心所欲地体现反动统治的意旨，更便于专横武断，为所欲为。“解释例”的作用也是如此。可以按照反动统治者的意志机械解释，也可以扩张解释。如在美国某些州内经常发生私人处死黑人事件，但可以不受法律制裁。依照他们法学家的解释，认为：“因为法律规范中固定的场合如与社会日常生活不相适应时，是可以用传统（美、英的成例法就是依传统习惯）的范围内相当常识，而由法官来自由裁量的。”中国伪北洋军阀政府大理院以至国民党反动统治时期法院造的“判决例”、“解释例”之所以数量很多，比较颁行的法律条文还要多几倍，其原因就在此。如伪大理院有这样一个解释例：“既经业主有效撤佃之后，若佃户补清欠租，不经业主同意，仍不能恢复佃权。”（统字第一二三二号）这显然是保护地主、压迫农民的一种解释例。又如国民党伪最高法院的解释例说：“妾虽为民法所不规定，惟妾与家长既以永久共同生活为目的（中略），应视为家属。”（上字第一○七号）这是承认男人纳妾为合法。有一判决例说：“妻受夫之直系尊亲属之虐待致不堪为共同生活者，虽得请求离婚，但所谓虐待必其事实在一般客观上足以认其确有不能共同生活之情形，方得准许离婚。”（上字第七六二号）这是限制妇女的离婚自由，而把妇女遭受虐待认为不一定是离婚理由，借以保护封建的夫权统治，压制、迫害妇女。又如伪最高法院曾解释：“共产党案件应依反革命论罪。”（解字第一六号）一九三一年九月五日伪行政院训令规定：“剿匪区域内惩治盗匪暂行条例及危害民国紧急治罪法准予变通使用。”如此等等，说明伪法院的判例和解释例无非是反人民的法律的巧妙补充和随意扩大，一切都是为了保护其反动统治。
    从前面所述中国旧法的史实看来，自周、秦以来，由于历代的法律一贯是反动统治阶级压迫人民的工具，所以，为了一个共同目的——压迫人民，这一朝代可以沿用或抄袭那一朝代的法律。国民党的反动法律，则还抄袭了法西斯国家的法律。所以国民党反动的“六法全书”，其来源有三：一是承袭封建王朝和北洋军阀时期的法令，这部分基本上是属于封建的反动法律体系的；二是搬运许多资本主义国家的欺骗人民压迫人民的法典条文；三是吸取了德、日、意等法西斯国家的法令。可见“六法全书”是集封建的、买办的、法西斯的反动法律思想之大成。因此，“六法全书”以及国民党反动派一切法律、法令和司法制度，都是压迫人民的，彻头彻尾地反动的，与新中国的人民法律原则根本相违反的，必须予以全部的摧毁。因此，我们现在所开展的反旧法观点的运动，决不只是反对国民党“六法全书”的具体条文，而是反对一切反动的法律思想和司法制度。
