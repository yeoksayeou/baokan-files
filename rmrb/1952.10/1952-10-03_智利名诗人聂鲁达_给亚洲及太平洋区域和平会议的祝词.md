The famous Chilean poet Neruda
Message of Congratulations to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference

For more than a century since the independence of the Americas, the peoples of the Americas have gazed at the ocean, asking the vast and boundless Pacific, but they have seen nothing and received no answer.

However, great nations, peoples in struggle, like wonderful fruits, grow, blossom, bear fruit, and develop on the distant shores of the Pacific.

The ocean separates us. The ocean becomes an abyss, drowning out the voices of mankind.

Across this ocean, in the past, were only colonists seeking blood and treasure, and imperialists. They sought and found oil, tin, tea, nitrates, copper, sugar, and pearls. But they did not gain the friendship and love of the people. Strong voices of protest spread across the seven seas. These voices became words. These words became songs. These songs became weapons, became victories in struggle.

This is the voice of the oppressed people. They are tired of the abuse and humiliation inflicted upon them, tired of the insatiable greed of foreigners, but they are not tired of fighting. All seven seas have heard their songs.

In order to prevent people from hearing the people's songs, there are no new ships traveling on the ocean; however, the voices of those who fight for the sacred cause, for peace, for freedom, for brotherly love between people, are extraordinarily loud.

In Iquique, the old Chilean seaport that exports nitrates, in Guayaquil, Ecuador, in Manzanillo, a small seaport in Mexico, the voices from across the ocean are listened to with all our hearts. The words of Mao Zedong are recited and spread widely throughout North and South America, and people everywhere listen with respect and love.

For us, the people of the Americas, this voice is familiar; it is our own voice. Therefore, the ocean cannot stop it. It crosses the vast and deep ocean.

The imperialists vainly attempt to blockade the great people of China. The governments of Latin American countries have lost their national self-esteem and independent sovereignty and have accepted the order of the blockade. However, it is we, these small countries, who are being blockaded. China continues to grow stronger, and its voice becomes louder and louder, spreading throughout the world. At the same time, the small countries along the Pacific coast are being squeezed dry by the big merchants and bankers of New York and continue to be impoverished. Ships cross the sea only to transport weapons and instruments of destruction. But the people of the whole world have seen these ships, recognized the fact of the massacred Korea, and heard the songs of friendship from distant people.

The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is the great chorus of voices of friendship flying across the ocean. This united song will for the first time sing of resistance to isolation, resistance to aggression, resistance to greed and destructive forces.

This is the first time that the people of Asia and the Pacific coast have united closely, in order to understand each other, to exchange ideas and achievements, hopes and realities, experiences and plans, to exchange bags full of rice and wheat, instead of weapons of murder.

The people of Asia and the Pacific coast are all concerned about this important conference. Let the ocean unite us with its torrential waves, eliminate distance, and bring human cultures closer together on the path of peace and creation.

    智利名诗人聂鲁达
    给亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的祝词
    自从美洲各国独立以来，一个多世纪之久，美洲各国的人民瞭望着海洋，向那广大无边的太平洋致问，可是他们什么也没有看见，他们没有得到答复。
    然而，伟大的民族，在斗争中的各国人民，好像美妙的果实一般，在太平洋遥远的海岸上成长、开花结果和发展。
    海洋使我们分开。海洋成为一个深渊，淹没了人类的声音。
    横渡这个海洋的，过去仅仅是一些寻找鲜血和财宝的殖民者，此外就是帝国主义者。他们寻找并且找到了石油、锡、茶、硝酸盐、铜、糖和珍珠。可是他们却得不到人民的友谊和爱。强劲的抗议呼声传遍了七大洋。这呼声变成了言语。这言语变成歌唱。这歌唱又变成了武器，变成了斗争的胜利。
    这是被压迫人民的呼声。他们对于加在他们身上的虐待凌辱，对于外国人的贪得无餍已感到厌倦，可是他们并不倦于斗争。七个大洋全都听见他们的歌声。
    为了使人听不见人民的歌唱，海洋上不再有新的船只来往；然而那些为了神圣的事业而斗争的人们，为了和平，为了自由，为了人与人之间的友爱而斗争的人们的声音异常响亮。
    在输出硝酸盐的老旧智利海港伊基圭，在厄瓜多尔的瓜阿基尔，在墨西哥的小海港曼萨尼罗，从海洋对岸传来的声音都被全心倾听，毛泽东的言语被人传诵，并且在南北美洲广泛传播，到处的人民都怀着敬意和热爱来倾听。
    对于我们美洲人民，这个声音是熟悉的；它也就是我们自己的声音。因此海洋不能拦阻，它横过了辽阔深邃的海洋。
    帝国主义者妄想封锁伟大的人民中国。拉丁美洲各国政府丧失了民族自尊心和独立主权，接受了封锁的命令。但是，被封锁的却是我们这些小国家。中国继续壮大起来，它的声音一天比一天宏亮，传遍了世界。而同时，太平洋沿岸的小国家被纽约的大商人和银行家压榨得油干血尽，继续穷困下去。轮船横渡大海，只为了输送武器和破坏性的工具。但是，全世界人民都看见了这些船只，认识了受着残杀的朝鲜的事实，也听见了远方人们的友爱的歌声。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议就是飞越海洋的友爱声音的大合唱。这团结起来的歌声将要第一次唱出反抗隔离、反抗侵略、反抗贪婪和破坏力量的歌曲。
    这是第一次，亚洲和太平洋沿岸的人民紧紧联合起来，为了互相了解，为了互相交换思想和成果、希望和现实、经验和计划，为了互相交换装满米麦的口袋，而不是杀人的武器。
    亚洲和太平洋沿岸的人民都关心着这个重大的会议。让海洋用它的滔滔不绝的波涛把我们团结起来，消灭距离，在和平与创造的道路上使人类的文化互相接近。（新华社）
