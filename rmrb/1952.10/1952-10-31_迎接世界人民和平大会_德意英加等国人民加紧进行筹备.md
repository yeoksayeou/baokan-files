Xinhua News Agency, October 30th:

    People in Germany, Italy, Britain and Canada are stepping up preparations for the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna in December.

    German Peace Committee Secretary-General Wellmann said: Germany will send approximately 150 representatives to the World People's Peace Congress, of which 100 will be representatives from West Germany and approximately 50 will be representatives from the German Democratic Republic. The West German representatives will be selected at peace conferences currently being held throughout West Germany. The representatives from the German Democratic Republic will be selected at the conference on promoting mutual understanding among the German people and striving for a just peace treaty, to be held in Berlin from November 28th to 29th this year. Currently, peace conferences are being held in all states and districts of the German Democratic Republic and in various places in West Germany. Representatives from all walks of life—workers, farmers, intellectuals, students, veterans, and housewives—are speaking at the meetings, expressing their strong support for the World People's Peace Congress.

    In Italy, peace rallies are being held everywhere, and many local rallies have combined opposition to the construction of bases by the U.S. military in Italy with the peace movement. The town of Ghedi in the province of Brescia held a "Day for Peace and Independence" to protest the U.S. military's plan to build an airport in Ghedi.

    At conferences in the three provinces of Treviso, Udine and Forlì, working people also protested against the construction of airports by the U.S. military in the area. At conferences held in Milan and other places, the masses unanimously condemned the bacteriological warfare waged by the American aggressors against the people of Korea and China. Professor Oliver, an Italian member of the International Scientific Commission, delivered a speech at the Milan conference. Nitti, a member of the Italian Parliamentary Peace Committee, also sent a letter to Joliot-Curie, representing Italian parliamentarians in expressing their willingness to participate in the World People's Peace Congress.

    The British Preparatory Committee for the World People's Peace Congress has received official notification that fourteen representatives to the congress have been elected in various regions, including prominent trade unionists and representatives of various peace organizations. In Canada, when the Third National Conference of the Canadian Women's Assembly was held in Toronto, all the delegates unanimously expressed their support for the World People's Peace Congress and selected Elizabeth Brown as a representative to attend the congress.
