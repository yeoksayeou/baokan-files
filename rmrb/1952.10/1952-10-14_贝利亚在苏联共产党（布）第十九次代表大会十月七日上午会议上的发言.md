    Comrades! Comrade Malenkov's report of the Central Committee summarizes the activities of our Party during the period from the Eighteenth to the Nineteenth Congress. There were two events of particular significance in the lives of our Party and the peoples of all nationalities of the Soviet Union during this period, and I would like to talk about these two events.
    The first event was the Great Patriotic War.
    This war determined the fate of our country and the countries and peoples of Europe and Asia. Everyone understands that if the Hitler bandit gang's alliance had been victorious, the result would have been the terrible enslavement and destruction of the people of our country and the people of many other countries, hundreds of millions of people would have been reduced to slavery, and the fascist barbarians would have destroyed modern civilization and set mankind back decades.
    This did not happen mainly because the peoples of all nationalities of the Soviet Union won a complete victory in the life-and-death struggle against the fascist aggressors. The sudden and treacherous attack on the Soviet Union created conditions favorable to the Hitler bandit army in the early stages of the war. However, at the cost of huge sacrifices, and with the people exerting all their material and spiritual strength to support it, the Soviet Union victoriously defended its independence, defeated the enemy that had caused the armies of European countries to flee at the mere sight of it, and thus saved mankind and its civilization.
    The inspirer and organizer of the great victory of the Soviet people was the Communist Party led by Comrade Stalin. (Prolonged applause) From the early days of the war, when our country was in a very serious situation, Comrade Stalin led the State Defense Committee and the armed forces of our country. Our wise and fearless leader, with the greatest courage, led the Soviet army and the entire Soviet people through the flames of war, through the difficulties and tests of war, and defeated the enemy. Our Party and the peoples of all nationalities of the Soviet Union were extremely fortunate to have Comrade Stalin leading the Soviet state and its army in that difficult period. (Prolonged, stormy applause)
    The victory of the Soviet people proved to the world that the strength and power of our socialist country is unshakable.
    This is one of the most important lessons of the Great Patriotic War. However, not everyone has learned the lessons of history. The American imperialists, fattened by two world wars and intoxicated by dreams of world hegemony, are once again pushing the peoples of all countries into the abyss of world war.
    Currently, the American bosses, that is, the Morgan family, the Rockefeller family, the Mellon family, the DuPont family, etc., who control the American state and war machine, are working hard to organize new world monopolies such as the European Coal and Steel Community and the World Oil Cartel in order to control the economies of other countries more quickly and make them serve their own interests. They want to establish their absolute rule all over the world so that they can safely obtain super profits by plundering and enslaving the peoples of other countries.
    To achieve this goal, they need war. In preparing for war, the big American capitalists collude with the American military and adopt the entire set of methods of the fascist regime in order to suppress the people's desire to maintain peace and suppress any resistance from the people to their reckless policies. While pushing the United States onto the road to war, they also expect that arms expansion and the war situation will enable them to prevent economic crises. But this crisis is relentlessly approaching the American economy, and no trick or gamble by the American financial giants can prevent it. They are accelerating the expansion of armaments and making their entire economy subordinate to the purpose of preparing for war. As a result, they are more afraid of peace than of war, although there is no doubt that if they really launch a war, they will only bring themselves closer to collapse and destruction. (Applause)
    They are establishing a series of military bases all over the world and are desperately piecing together various aggressive military blocs, frantically preparing for war against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries. They are constantly sending spies and saboteurs from the dregs of humanity gathered from all over the world into our country and other peace-loving countries. In the struggle against enemy spies, the vigilance of the Soviet people is the sharpest weapon. There is no doubt that the improvement and strengthening of the vigilance of the Soviet people will make the spies of the imperialist warmongers unable to use their tricks, no matter how many spies are sent and how cleverly they are disguised. (Applause)
    The blatant and unreasonable provocations and adventures against the Soviet Union by the American military authorities (numerous naval, land, and air force exercises, "inspection" trips by Atlantic Group military leaders in areas close to the Soviet border, and various activities by American military aircraft near the eastern and western borders of the Soviet Union) are clearly intended to disturb the mood of the Soviet people and maintain a war psychosis in their own country and in the countries they are vassals to.
    Only incorrigible fools would expect such provocations to intimidate the Soviet people. (Prolonged applause) The Soviet people know how much all the provocations and threats of the warmongers are worth. The Soviet people continue to engage in their peaceful construction with unwavering calmness. They have confidence in the strength and power of their country and army, and their country and army are capable of giving a devastating blow to anyone who dares to invade our country and dispelling their thoughts of violating the Soviet border once and for all. (Stormy applause)
    Another most important event in the life of the Party and the Soviet people is the new and huge development of the national economy, which has made it possible for us to raise our industrial level to 2.3 times the pre-war level and take a big step forward on the road from socialism to communism. The war launched against us by the Hitler fascist bandits was the most cruel and arduous of all the wars our country has experienced, and it interrupted our peaceful development. The Hitler bandits implemented a barbaric "scorched earth" tactic in the areas they occupied, causing serious damage to the Soviet national economy.
    Therefore, when the war ended, we faced the most difficult task: to restore normal life in the areas that had been subjected to German occupation, to restore the pre-war level of industry and agriculture, and then to surpass this level to a considerable extent.
    In this difficult period, Comrade Stalin prepared a comprehensive plan for the revitalization of the national economy for us and instructed us on how to accomplish it. With his characteristic iron will and energy, Comrade Stalin directly guided the Party and the state in organizing the working class, collective farmers, and intellectuals to carry out all the work to realize the post-war Five-Year Plan. Everyone knows that the post-war Five-Year Plan has been successfully completed. (Applause)
    At present, our country's industry, agriculture, and transportation are developing on the basis of the most advanced machines and technologies, which guarantees the continuous increase of all social production on an unprecedented scale.
    Here are a few examples illustrating the scale of our industrial production: The total industrial output in 1951 and 1952 was 22 percent more than the total industrial output in all the years of the first and second Five-Year Plans. (Applause) In 1952 alone, the output of major items in industrial production, such as electricity, steel, coal, petroleum products, cement, and consumer goods, was much greater than the output in all the years of the first Five-Year Plan.
    As for the machine-building industry, which is the foundation of the technical progress of the entire national economy, it is developing even faster. This year alone, more machines and equipment will be produced than the output of the first and second Five-Year Plans combined.
    With the improvement of socialist production, the lives of all the Soviet people are constantly improving year by year.
    In terms of economy, politics, and national defense, the Soviet Union today is unprecedentedly powerful, and it has greater strength to withstand any test. (Prolonged applause)
    If the enemy dares to launch a war against us, the Soviet Union, leading the camp of peace and democracy, will certainly be able to give any group of imperialist aggressor countries a devastating counterattack, and will certainly be able to eliminate and punish the arrogant aggressors and warmongers. (Applause)
    Comrades! A decisive condition for the Soviet people to achieve victory in war and in peaceful economic and cultural development is the wise and far-sighted national policy of our Party. More than sixty nationalities, tribes, and ethnic groups live and work together in this Soviet multi-ethnic country. Under these conditions, the implementation of a correct national policy is of great importance to the victory of our common cause—strengthening the Soviet Union's power and building a communist society.
    The scientifically demonstrated and profound theory on the national question, which is part of the Leninist proletarian revolutionary theory, is the basis of our Party's national policy. Lenin and Stalin were the formulators of the Communist Party's program and policy on the national question. Therefore, our national policy is called the Lenin-Stalin national policy. Our Party's national policy is warmly supported and unanimously endorsed by the peoples of all nationalities of the Soviet Union.
    Lenin and Stalin directly led the establishment of the Soviet multi-ethnic country. After the death of the great Lenin, Comrade Stalin has been guiding all the work of our Party in building brotherly cooperation among the various nationalities of our country, in strengthening the alliance of the various republics, and in developing the economy and culture of the peoples of all nationalities of our country.
    Comrade Stalin played an important role in interpreting the Marxist-Leninist theory on the national question. He enriched Marxism-Leninism with the theory on the national question, he developed the Leninist theory on the consistency of the domestic and international tasks of the working class and on the strategy and tactics of the national liberation movements in the era of imperialism, he studied the theoretical basis of the national policy implemented by the Communist Party in the multi-ethnic Soviet state environment, and he created the theory on socialist countries and their development in the struggle for the victory of communism.
    The great October Revolution overthrew capitalism, liberated the peoples of all nationalities in Russia, eliminated national oppression, and brought true rebirth to the peoples of all nationalities. After the bourgeoisie and its nationalist parties were overthrown, and after the Soviet system was consolidated in our country, a new socialist state emerged from the old bourgeois state, and has been developing and growing ever since.
    The actual imbalance in economic and cultural development between the advanced nationalities of central Russia and the nationalities in the formerly more backward border regions left over by the Tsarist system has been eliminated in our country due to the consistent implementation of the Lenin-Stalin national policy. Today there are no more backward nationalities in our country. The new socialist nationalities in our country have fundamentally changed their appearance and have developed into advanced modern nationalities in the years of socialist construction.
    What does the concept of advanced socialist nationality contain?
    Based on Comrade Stalin's classic definition of a nation and his theory on new socialist nationalities, and based on the historical experience of our Soviet multi-ethnic country, we can say that an advanced socialist nationality has the following main characteristics:
    First, it has the most progressive social and state system in the world, in which there are no exploiting classes, and all power belongs to the people.
    Second, it has a highly developed socialist industry and large-scale socialist agriculture.
    Third, the residents are universally literate, children receive compulsory education, and there is a developed higher education system that guarantees the training of national cadres specializing in various aspects of economic and cultural work; science and art are developed.
    Fourth, through the development of trade, to ensure increased real wages for workers and income for farmers, thereby systematically improving the living standards of all residents, building cities and improving cities, and improving living conditions; it has a vast network of medical institutions that can guarantee the protection of people's health.
    Fifth, the victory of the idea of equality among all races and nationalities, and the victory of the idea of friendship among all nationalities.
    Do our Soviet republics have these characteristics of an advanced socialist nationality? Yes, they have these characteristics.
    Let's take a look at the facts.
    Everyone knows that the Tsarist system was the oppressor and executioner of the peoples of all nationalities in Russia. Many non-Russian nationalities had no rights at all. They did not have their own country, they were ruled by Tsarist officials, and affairs in all institutions were handled through Russian, which was not understood by the local nationalities.
    Under the Soviet system, the peoples of all nationalities in our country have established and developed their own countries. Under the Soviet regime, the border regions of Tsarist Russia have been transformed from colonies and semi-colonies into truly independent states - Soviet republics. They have their own territory, national autonomy, their own constitutions, and their own laws. In the power organs, economic organs, administrative organs, and judicial organs of the union republics, autonomous republics, national states, national special zones, national districts, and national villages, men and women elected by the people who understand the lifestyles, customs, and psychology of the local residents are managing state affairs in the local languages understood by all residents.
    There is no such true national equality in any bourgeois country. This is understandable, because it is impossible to eliminate national oppression within the scope of the capitalist system. Everyone knows that the entire state administrative system of bourgeois countries is built on the basis of inequality among various races and nationalities, racial discrimination, and the use of nationalist prejudices to incite discord and conflict among the various nationalities. In our era, racial and national discrimination is particularly severe in two countries - the United States and the Union of South Africa.
    The Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union, consistently implementing the Lenin-Stalin national policy, while vigorously developing the entire national economy of the Soviet Union, enabled the economically backward national republics to achieve more rapid development. This has eliminated the past economic and cultural inequalities among the peoples of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. This is undoubtedly one of the most significant achievements of the national policy of the Soviet state.
    The achievements in development of the various Soviet national republics can be illustrated by many convincing materials, but I will only give a few examples.
    In the years of several Stalin Five-Year Plans, the metallurgical, petroleum, and chemical industries have been transformed in the Soviet republics; huge hydroelectric power stations, agricultural machines, tractor and automobile factories, cement plants, large textile mills, food factories, and many other industrial establishments have been built.
    From the examples of the eastern Soviet republics (Uzbek, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Turkmen, and Tajik republics), it can be seen that the development of national republics, especially large-scale industries, is faster than the industrial development of the Soviet Union as a whole. The output of large-scale industries in these republics increased 22 times from 1928 to 1951, while the entire Soviet Union increased only 16 times during the same period.
    Everyone knows that not long ago, the industrial development of the eastern border regions of Tsarist Russia was no different from that of their neighbors such as Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan.
    In the Soviet era, our Central Asian republics have rapidly surpassed the eastern countries neighboring the Soviet Union in industrial development, and have far surpassed them. Taking electricity, an important indicator of industrial development, as an example, if we compare the above-mentioned Soviet republics with several eastern countries, we can see that the five Soviet republics (Uzbek, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Turkmen, and Tajik) with a total population of approximately 17 million produce three times as much electricity as the total electricity produced by Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan with a population of 156 million. (Applause) If we compare the electricity output of one Soviet republic, such as Azerbaijan, with Turkey, we can see that Soviet Azerbaijan, which has only one-seventh of the population of Turkey, produces four times as much electricity as Turkey, which has stuck its head into the American "aid" trap (the whole audience roared with laughter).
    Our Soviet republics have also greatly surpassed the old industrial countries of Western Europe in development. For example, let us compare one Soviet republic—Ukraine—with two large bourgeois countries in Europe—France and Italy. Of course, not everything can be compared in this example. Everyone knows that in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the exploiting classes have long been eliminated, factories, workshops, land, and all the products of labor have become the property of the people, unemployment has disappeared, and all power belongs entirely to the people. In this regard, France and Italy, where the capitalists are in power, have been lagging behind Soviet Ukraine for more than 30 years. (The whole audience cheered) Therefore, we can only compare some of the most important economic statistics of these countries.
    The Soviet Ukraine has twice been subjected to foreign invasion since its existence, and has finally been revived from the ruins and ashes left by the invaders. It now produces much more pig iron than France and Italy combined; (Applause) it produces more steel and rolled metal than France, and more than three times that of Italy; it mines one and a half times more coal than France and Italy combined; the tractors manufactured by Soviet Ukraine, calculated in horsepower, are almost three times the total manufactured by France and Italy combined; it produces much more grain, potatoes, beets, and sugar than France and Italy combined.
    Due to the development of socialist industry and collective agriculture, the Ukrainian people live a prosperous life and enjoy all the benefits of culture, which the working people of France and Italy are deprived of.
    The rapid economic development of the Baltic Soviet republics after the establishment of the Soviet system can also illustrate the problem. Comparing the three union republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia with Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium, it can be seen that the industrial development speed of the three Soviet republics far exceeds the industrial development speed of the above-mentioned European capitalist countries.
    By the beginning of 1952, the level of industrial production in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic had increased to 2.4 times the pre-war level; 3.6 times in the Latvian Republic, and 4.1 times in the Estonian Republic; while during the same period, the level of industrial production in Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium only slightly exceeded the pre-war level, and the economies of these Soviet republics suffered much greater destruction in the war.
    It is worth pointing out that in old capitalist Latvia, even according to the figures tampered with by the rulers at the time, industrial production only increased to 1.5 times from 1913 to 1939 (that is, in 26 years); while in the new Soviet Latvia, from 1940 to 1951 (that is, in 11 years), despite the war and the devastation of enemy occupation, industrial production has increased to 3.6 times.
    The achievements in agricultural development are just as great.
    The victory of the Soviet collective farm system has made the agriculture of the various Soviet republics rise steadily. The collective farm system is one of the greatest achievements of the Soviet regime, because this system has absorbed the masses of farmers to build socialism, opened up new and unprecedented opportunities for the development of all agricultural production sectors, and created the conditions for the continuous improvement of the material and cultural levels of millions of farmers.
    Therefore, now in all the Soviet republics, we have large-scale socialist agriculture, conducting a large amount of commodity production, widely applying the latest achievements in agronomy, and having new agricultural equipment that is better equipped than the agriculture of any other country.
    This situation can be seen in every republic of the Soviet Union. However, now I will specifically talk about the situation in the eastern republics in this regard. Everyone knows that before the establishment of the Soviet government, agriculture in those areas was the most backward in the country, and there were no agricultural machines of any kind, not even the simplest ones.
    Now, in the fields of the collective farms and state farms in the Uzbek, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Turkmen, and Tajik Soviet Socialist Republics, there are 121,000 tractors (calculated in 15 horsepower units), 23,000 combine harvesters, 102,000 machines for sowing, cultivating, and picking cotton, and hundreds of thousands of other types of agricultural machines and tools.
    The agricultural machinery equipment in the eastern Soviet republics far exceeds that of the most developed capitalist countries in Europe. (Applause)
    Taking the supply of tractors as an example, in the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, there are an average of 14 tractors for every 1,000 hectares of cultivated land. In France, the same amount of cultivated land has only 7 tractors with smaller horsepower; in Italy, the same amount of cultivated land has only 4 tractors with smaller horsepower. Needless to say, the number of tractors in other countries in the East is even more negligible. The Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic has one tractor for every 70 hectares of cultivated land, while Pakistan has one tractor for every 9,000 hectares, India has one tractor for every 13,000 hectares, and Iran has one tractor for every 18,000 hectares.
    The socialist agriculture has been equipped with a large number of machines, which has greatly reduced the labor of farmers. In addition to modern scientific farming methods and the extensive development of irrigation work, this has guaranteed a bumper harvest.
    Taking cotton as an example, cotton is one of the main industrial crops of the developed and diverse agriculture in the eastern Soviet republics. The average yield per unit area of raw cotton in these republics in 1951 was 21 centners per hectare.
    No cotton-producing country in the world can compare with the yield per unit area obtained by Soviet cotton planters. In the same year—1951, the yield per unit area of cotton in Egypt was 11.5 centners per hectare, 8.3 centners in the United States, 3.4 centners in India, 5.2 centners in Pakistan, 7.2 centners in Turkey, and 4.5 centners in Iran.
    It should be taken into account that the cotton area in the eastern Soviet republics is very large, which can be seen from the fact that the cotton production of the above-mentioned republics is equal to the total cotton production of India, Egypt, Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan.
    (Applause)
    These are some facts about the economic development of the Soviet national republics. They show that the economies of these republics are continuing to grow and develop without any crises or recessions. Finally, these facts show how much the people who have gotten rid of the shackles of imperialism and liberated themselves from the rule of landlords and capitalists can achieve. (Applause)
    In order to establish an advanced socialist economy in the Soviet national republics, it is necessary to eliminate cultural backwardness in most areas of the republics, promote cultural development on the widest scale, establish a wide network of elementary and secondary schools teaching in their own national languages, reorganize the higher education system, and train large numbers of skilled workers, engineers, technicians, agronomists, livestock breeding experts, teachers, and doctors from all nationalities.
    As a result of the implementation of the Lenin-Stalin national policy, the peoples of all nationalities in the Soviet Union have completed a true cultural revolution.
    At present, more than two million engineering and technical personnel are working in industrial construction and transportation; approximately 400,000 agronomists, livestock breeding experts, forestry, and other experts are engaged in agricultural work; nearly two million teachers and lecturers are working in schools, technical schools, and higher education institutions; and urban and rural health institutions have nearly 300,000 physicians and 900,000 doctors, assistant doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel. Every Soviet republic now has hundreds of thousands of experts who have received higher education.
    The Soviet republics have established a series of higher education institutions and technical schools to train cadres of Soviet intellectuals from local nationalities. When the Soviet regime was established, there were a total of 96 higher education institutions in our country, most of which, with very few exceptions, were located in the main central cities of Russia. These schools had a total of 117,000 students.
    Now there are a total of 887 higher education institutions in the Soviet Union, with 1.4 million students. There are now 216,000 students in Ukraine, 104,000 in the Central Asian Soviet republics, 80,000 in the Transcaucasian republics, 35,000 in Belarus, and 37,000 in the Baltic republics.
    The Soviet republics have not only greatly surpassed the eastern countries abroad in the development of higher education, but have also greatly surpassed the countries of Western Europe.
    For example, there are now 58 students in higher education per 10,000 residents in Tajikistan, 60 in Turkmenistan, 64 in Kyrgyzstan, 71 in Uzbekistan, and 93 in Azerbaijan. However, there are only 3 people in higher education per 10,000 people in Iran, 9 in India, 12 in Egypt and Turkey, 21 in Sweden, 32 in Italy, 34 in Denmark, and 36 in France.
    Since the establishment of the Soviet government, 48 nationalities have created their own writing systems and have printed textbooks, books, and newspapers in their own national languages. In the past 30 years, the Soviet republics have established approximately 90,000 well-equipped schools, nearly two-thirds of which are located in the union republics and autonomous republics of various nationalities. With the development of the socialist economy, the welfare of the peoples of all nationalities in the Soviet Union has also improved year by year. In all the Soviet republics, the real wages of workers and the income of farmers have greatly increased. Between 1940 and 1951, the total income of workers and farmers increased by 78 percent.
    The Soviet state has done a lot of work in protecting the health of the peoples of all nationalities in our country. The abundant medical services prepared for the people are proof of this. I will list some examples from some Soviet republics to illustrate this point.
    Before the establishment of the Soviet government, there was only one doctor for every 31,000 people in Uzbekistan, which was similar to the situation in Pakistan today. Now there is one doctor for every 895 people in the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. The Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic is many times stronger in terms of the number of doctors than Egypt, which has one doctor for every 4,350 people; at the same time, it is also stronger than some Western European countries, such as France, which has one doctor per 1,000 people, and the Netherlands, which has one doctor per 1,160 people.
    In the Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic, there is one doctor for every 490 people. Therefore, in terms of medical services, the people of Soviet Azerbaijan are 7.5 times stronger than the people of Turkey and 22 times stronger than the people of Iran. In the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, there is one doctor for every 373 people, and in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, there is one doctor for every 483 people. The people of these two republics enjoy medical services that are stronger than those of the people of any country in the world. But the people of the Soviet republics not only have a large number of doctors who are always at their service. To understand the full picture, it must be remembered that in the Soviet Union, people enjoy all kinds of medical services free of charge, and millions of working people go to sanatoriums and resorts every year, while in bourgeois countries, medical services are mostly paid for and are very expensive. Therefore, medical services are beyond the financial reach of the broad masses of working people, and going to resorts and sanatoriums in those countries is a privilege of parasitic exploiters.
    Under the Soviet social system and state system, the development of socialist nationalities, the true elimination of economic and cultural inequality among nationalities, and the lasting cooperation of nationalities in defending the Soviet state, defending against foreign enemy invasions, and building socialism have made the idea of national equality and the idea of friendship among nationalities firmly established and completely victorious in our country.
    The friendship among the peoples of all nationalities in our country has been tested many times. One of the greatest tests of the consolidation of friendship among the peoples of all nationalities was the war against the Hitler bandit gang alliance.
    After the Great Patriotic War, the friendship among the peoples of all nationalities in our country was given a new and powerful expression in the period of restoring the socialist economy in the border areas that had been subjected to enemy occupation. All the Soviet people wholeheartedly participated in the work of restoring the economy of the occupied republics and states, because they regarded this work as something of great importance to them and also as an urgent task of great importance to the country. Which people in a bourgeois country can help each other like this?
    Now, as the Soviet Union gradually transitions from socialism to communism, the friendship among the peoples of all nationalities in the Soviet Union has gained new content in the process of development. The high economic and cultural levels achieved by the Soviet republics have created the possibility for them to participate more actively in solving the major problems of the entire country.
    The force that unites the friendship among the peoples of all nationalities in our country is the Russian people, the Russian nation—the most outstanding nation among all the nations of the Soviet Union. (Stormy applause)
    In October 1917, the Russian working class, under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, completed the greatest and most historically significant achievement: it broke through the front line of world imperialism, destroyed the forces of the bourgeoisie, and shattered the shackles of national and colonial oppression that were pressing down on the peoples occupying one-sixth of the world's land. Undoubtedly, without the help of the Russian working class, the peoples of all nationalities in our country could not have resisted the White Guards and interventionists, and could not have built socialism. As for the nationalities that had not previously undergone the stage of capitalist development, without the long-term, continuous, and systematic help of the Russian working class, they could not have transitioned from pre-capitalist economic forms to socialism.
    Comrade Stalin once said that the open-mindedness, faithful character, and endurance inherent in the Russian people were particularly powerfully demonstrated during the Great Patriotic War. Due to their heroism, courage, and decisiveness, the Russian people won universal praise in this war and were considered to be the leading Soviet force among the various nationalities of our country. (Prolonged applause)
    Following the example of the Russian people, all other nationalities in our country fought shoulder to shoulder with the Russian nationality in a spirit of self-sacrifice against the enemy; they, like the Russian nationality, were the creators of our victory in defeating Hitler Germany and imperialist Japan. The peoples of all nationalities in our country have proven to the world that the Soviet socialist multi-ethnic country based on the Stalinist friendship of all nationalities has a powerful and invincible force.
    Common vested interests are the basis of the friendship among the nationalities of our country. The factor that unites the nationalities of the Soviet Union is their willingness and determination to defend the freedom, independence, and happy life they have obtained under the Soviet government from the encroachment of any enemy; the factor that unites them is their joint effort to build a communist society. The people of our country clearly know that, united in a single Soviet state—the Union of Republics—by the unbreakable Stalinist friendship, they are invincible, able to victoriously build communism and defend their fruits from any danger.
    Our Party and Comrade Stalin himself have been paying attention to ensuring that the Soviet national policy is correctly implemented. In the struggle against the enemies of Leninism, the Party victoriously implemented the Lenin-Stalin national policy, ensuring the final and complete defeat of great-nation chauvinism, bourgeois nationalism, and bourgeois cosmopolitanism.
    The great contribution of Comrade Stalin, the leader of our Party, is that his wise leadership has ensured the true revival and unprecedented rise of the material and spiritual forces of the peoples of all nationalities in our country (applause), uniting them in an unbreakable brotherly friendship and guiding them toward a great goal—the strengthening of the strength of our country and the victory of communism. (Prolonged, enduring applause. All rise.)
    The victories achieved in the development of socialist nationalities under the unified, multi-ethnic Soviet state system are of great international significance. Our example points out to the working class in capitalist countries the road to liberate themselves from exploitation, poverty, and unemployment, and from the increasing danger of fascism.
    Our example points out to the people of colonial and dependent countries the road from oppression and enslavement to freedom and independence, from national strife and hatred to brotherly friendship among nations, from hunger and poverty to a prosperous life, and from ignorance and cultural backwardness to the flourishing of culture, science, and art.
    The entire historical process has repeatedly confirmed the words of Comrade Stalin, the leader of our Party: "We have now reached the stage where socialism can become (and has begun to become!) the banner of liberation for millions of people in the vast colonial countries under imperialism."
    The ideas of freedom and national independence and the ideas of socialism have penetrated into the most remote corners of the enslaved countries.
    The people struggling for liberation know that the great camp of peace and democracy is on their side; the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries are defending peace, freedom, independence, and the true equality of all races and nationalities. The very existence of these countries has curbed the dark forces of reaction, thereby making the struggle of oppressed nationalities easier to carry out.
    The ruling groups of the United States and other bourgeois countries, in the face of the increasingly high national liberation movement, appear so weak and powerless that they shout that the struggle of the oppressed people against their oppressors is the result of Soviet propaganda in the East.
    The unfortunate bourgeois politicians can find the answer in what Comrade Stalin said many years ago. Comrade Stalin said: "People accuse us of carrying out propaganda in the East... We do not need to carry out propaganda in the East. Any citizen of a dependent country or colony, as long as they come to the Soviet Union, can see how we govern the country, how black and white people, Russian and non-Russian people, people of all colors and all nationalities undertake work and jointly govern a great country. This can convince them that our country is the only country where the fraternity of all nationalities has become a reality rather than an empty phrase. The fact that the Soviet Union exists, we don't need written or oral propaganda at all."
    (Prolonged applause)
    The people's democratic countries are drawing on the rich experience gained in building and consolidating the multi-ethnic Soviet state when building their new lives.
    The relations between democratic countries are a completely new type of relations, which are unprecedented in human history. The main characteristics of this relationship are based on the following:
    Contrary to imperialism's policy of commanding and enslaving other peoples, all countries, large and small, enjoy true and complete equality, safeguarding the sovereignty and independence of each country, and not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries;
    Contrary to the policy of secret contracts, conspiracy, and infighting practiced by imperialist countries, countries respect each other's national interests, and the peoples of all countries trust and love each other;
    Contrary to the fierce struggle for raw materials and markets within the imperialist camp, countries conduct close economic cooperation and mutual assistance, fully guaranteeing the most favorable conditions for developing the economy in accordance with the national interests of each country;
    Contrary to imperialism's policy of militarizing the economy, instigating and accelerating another world war, and attacking the living standards of the working people, democratic countries jointly strive to defend peace, restore and develop economic and cultural relations between all countries, regardless of their economic and social systems, in order to improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people in all countries around the world.
    The characteristic of the relations between countries within the imperialist camp is that American capital has a delusional desire to dominate the world. After weaving a net all over the world, American imperialism, like a forever insatiable spider, sucks up the fat and blood of many nationalities and countries, and does not hesitate to use all means to enslave them. The most common method is to carry out enslavement under the guise of so-called American "aid." When a country receives American "aid," it immediately loses its sovereignty and independence and becomes a vassal state. Such a country can at most hope to act as an unequal partner.
    Britain, which was once called the "Lord of the Seas" and the "World Factory," is now acting as such an unequal partner to the United States. American imperialism is increasingly depriving Britain of raw materials and markets, and is using various methods to drive it out of Europe and Asia, seizing its strongholds one after another. It has now reached the point where the United States even rudely rejected the most basic requirements put forward by the British government, refusing to allow it to send an observer to the negotiations held by the United States and the British dominions of New Zealand and Australia on the so-called Pacific Pact. Regarding this, even the British conservative newspapers recently complained bitterly, saying that Britain was being treated as a poor relative who was reprimanded, despised, or looked down upon.

    贝利亚在苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会十月七日上午会议上的发言
    同志们！马林科夫同志所作的中央委员会的报告，总结了我党在第十八次代表大会到第十九次代表大会之间的这一段时期的活动。在这段时期我们的党和苏联各族人民的生活中发生了两件具有特别重大意义的事件，我想谈谈这两个事件。
    第一件事就是伟大的卫国战争。
    这次战争，决定了我国及欧亚两洲的国家和人民的命运。人人都明白，假如希特勒匪帮的联盟取得胜利，其结果就会是我国人民及许多其他国家人民遭受可怕的奴役和毁灭，亿万人民就会沦于奴隶的境地，法西斯野人就会破坏现代文明而使人类倒退数十年。
    这种情况所以没有发生，主要是由于苏联各族人民在与法西斯侵略者进行的生死斗争中获得了彻底的胜利。苏联之突然遭受背信弃义的攻击，在战争初期阶段造成了有利于希特勒匪军的条件。但苏联以巨大牺牲的代价，在人民拿出一切物质和精神力量极力支援下，胜利地保卫了自己的独立，击溃了曾经使得欧洲各国陆军望风而逃的敌人，从而拯救了人类及其文明。
    苏联人民的伟大胜利的鼓舞者和组织者是斯大林同志所领导的共产党。（经久不息的掌声）从我们国家处在非常严重的境地的战争初期起，斯大林同志就领导着国防委员会和我国的武装部队。我们的英明的、大无畏的领袖，以最大的勇气，领导苏联军队和全体苏联人民穿过战争的烈火，通过战争的困难和考验，战胜了敌人。我们的党和苏联各族人民在那个困难时期有斯大林同志领导着苏维埃国家和它的军队，是极其幸运的。（经久不息的、暴风雨般的掌声）
    苏联人民的胜利向全世界证明，我们的社会主义国家的力量和威力，是不可动摇的。
    这是伟大卫国战争的最重要的教训之一。然而，并不是所有的人都领会历史的教训的。靠两次世界大战中养肥了的、陶醉在世界霸权的梦想中的美帝国主义者，正在重新把各国人民推进世界战争的深渊里去。
    目前美国的头子们，即控制美国的国家和战争机器的摩根家族、洛克菲勒家族、梅隆家族和杜邦家族等，正在努力组织欧洲煤钢联营集团和世界石油卡特尔之类新的世界垄断机构，以便更快地控制其他国家的经济，使之为他们自己的利益服务。他们想要在世界各地建立他们的绝对统治，以便他们可以稳稳当当地靠掠夺及奴役其他国家人民来获得超额利润。
    为了达到这个目的，他们就需要战争。美国大资本家为了准备战争，就和美国军人勾结在一起，采取法西斯政权的整套办法，以便在国内镇压人民要求保持和平的愿望，镇压人民对他们的轻率的政策的一切反抗。他们在把美国推向战争道路时，还指望军备扩张和战争局面能够使他们防止经济危机。但是这种危机正在无情地向美国经济逼来，美国财政大王们的任何诡计，任何赌博都防止不了这种危机。他们加速地扩张军备并使他们的整个经济都服从准备战争的目的，结果他们对和平就比对战争还要害怕，虽然毫无疑问地，如果他们真的发动了战争，就只会使他们自己更加接近崩溃和毁灭。（掌声）
    他们在世界各地建立了一系列的军事基地并且拚命地拼凑各种侵略性的军事集团，疯狂地准备着反对苏联和其他爱好和平国家的战争。他们不断地把那些从世界各地收罗来的人类败类中的间谍和破坏分子派进我国和其他爱好和平的国家里。在反对敌人间谍的斗争中，苏联人民的警惕性是一个最锋利的武器；毫无疑问，苏联人民警惕的提高和加强，会使帝国主义战争贩子的间谍无所施其伎俩，那怕派来的间谍再多，他们伪装得再巧妙。（掌声）
    美国军事当局对苏联进行的明目张胆的无理挑衅和冒险（无数次海陆空军演习，大西洋集团军事头目在接近苏联边境的地区进行的“视察”旅行，美国军用飞机在苏联的东西边界附近进行的种种活动），都分明是想扰乱苏联人民的心情并维持他们自己国家里和他们附庸国家里的战争心理。
    只有不可救药的糊涂虫才会期望这样的挑衅吓倒苏联人民。（经久不息掌声）苏联人民知道战争贩子的一切挑衅和威胁值几个钱。苏联人民怀着毫不动摇的镇静心情，继续地从事他们的和平建设。他们对于自己国家和军队的力量和威力具有信心，他们的国家和军队对任何胆敢进犯我国的人，是能够给予歼灭性的打击并一劳永逸地打消他们侵犯苏联国境的念头的。（暴风雨般的掌声）
        党与苏维埃人民生活中另一个最重要的事件，是国民经济的新的巨大的发展，这种发展使我们有可能把我们的工业水平提高到战前水平的二点三倍，并在从社会主义到共产主义的道路上迈进一大步。希特勒法西斯匪帮对我们发动的战争是我们国家经历过的所有战争中最残酷与最艰苦的战争，这次战争打断了我们的和平发展。希特勒匪徒在他们占领的区域内实行野蛮的“焦土”战术，使苏维埃国民经济遭受到严重的创伤。
    因此，当战争结束时，我们面临了这样最困难的任务：使遭受德国占领的地区恢复正常的生活，恢复工业与农业的战前水平，随后在颇大的程度上超过这个水平。
    在这个困难的时期，斯大林同志给我们准备了一项复兴国民经济的全盘计划，并指示我们如何把它完成。斯大林同志以他特有的铁的意志与精力，直接指导党与国家在组织工人阶级、集体农民与知识分子为实现战后五年计划而进行的所有工作。大家知道，战后五年计划已经胜利地完成了。（掌声）
    目前，我们国家的工业、农业与运输业正在最先进的机器与技术的基础上发展，它保证了所有社会生产在空前的规模上不断提高。
    这里是说明我们工业生产规模的几个例子：一九五一年和一九五二年的工业总生产量比第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划期间所有年代的工业总生产量多百分之二十二。（掌声）单在一九五二年，像电力、钢铁、煤炭、石油产品、水泥及消费品这些工业生产中主要项目的产量，就比第一个五年计划所有年代中的产量大得多。
    至于就作为整个国民经济技术进展基础的机器制造工业来说，它的发展速度更大。单在今年，生产出来的机器和设备就要比第一个和第二个五年计划加在一起的产量还多。
    随着社会主义生产的提高，苏维埃全体人民的生活也在一年一年不断地提高与改善。
    在经济上与政治上，正像在国防力量上一样，今天的苏联已空前强大，它有更大的力量经受任何考验。（经久不息的掌声）
    如果敌人胆敢对我们发动战争，领导和平民主阵营的苏联一定能够给予帝国主义侵略国家的任何集团以歼灭性的反击，一定能够消灭与惩罚狂妄的侵略者与战争制造者。（掌声）
    同志们！苏维埃人民之所以能够在战争中和在和平的经济与文化发展中获得胜利，我们党的明智的、有远见的民族政策是一个决定性的条件。六十多个民族、部落和部族在这个苏维埃多民族的国家里共同生活着、工作着。在这种条件下，执行正确的民族政策，对于我们的共同事业——加强苏联力量与建设共产主义社会——的胜利，就具有非常重要的意义。
    作为列宁主义无产阶级革命学说一部分的、经过科学论证的、关于民族问题的精辟理论，是我们党的民族政策的基础。列宁和斯大林是共产党关于民族问题的纲领和政策的制订者。因此，我们的民族政策被称为列宁—斯大林民族政策。我们党的民族政策受到苏联各族人民的热烈赞助与一致拥护。
    列宁和斯大林直接领导了苏维埃多民族国家的建立。伟大的列宁逝世之后，斯大林同志一直在指导着我们党在建立我国各民族间的兄弟般合作方面，在加强各共和国的联盟以及发展我国各族人民的经济与文化方面的一切工作。
    斯大林同志在阐释马克思—列宁主义关于民族问题的学说方面起了重要的作用。他用关于民族问题的理论丰富了马克思—列宁主义，他发展了列宁主义关于工人阶级的国内和国际任务的一致性、关于帝国主义时代的民族解放运动的战略和策略的学说，他研究出共产党在多民族的苏维埃国家环境中实行的民族政策的理论基础，并创造了关于社会主义国家和它们在争取共产主义胜利的斗争中的发展学说。
    伟大的十月革命推翻了资本主义、解放了俄国的各族人民，消灭了民族压迫，给各族人民带来了真正的新生。在资产阶级及其民族主义的政党被推翻后，当苏维埃制度在我国巩固后，新的社会主义国家从旧的资产阶级国家中产生了，并且一直在发展着、成长着。
    由沙皇制度遗留下来的、俄罗斯中部先进的各民族与在过去较它们落后的边境地区各民族之间在经济和文化发展上的实际不平衡状态，已由于列宁—斯大林民族政策的始终一贯的执行，而在我国消除了。今天我国已不再有任何落后民族了。我国境内的新的社会主义民族已根本改变了它们的面貌，并在社会主义建设的年代里发展为先进的现代民族。
    先进的社会主义民族的概念包含些什么内容呢？
    从斯大林同志对于民族所下的经典定义及他关于新的社会主义民族的学说出发，从我们苏维埃多民族国家的历史经验出发，我们可以说，一个先进的社会主义民族具有下列几个主要特点：
    第一，有世界上最进步的社会和国家制度，在这个制度中没有剥削阶级，全部政权属于人民。
    第二，有一个高度发达的社会主义工业和大规模的社会主义农业。
    第三，居民普遍识字，儿童都受义务教育，拥有保证训练专门从事经济和文化各方面工作的民族干部的发达的高等教育系统；科学和艺术发达。
    第四，通过发展贸易，以保证增加职工的实际工资和农民的收入，从而有步骤地提高全体居民的生活水平，建设城市和改善城市，改善居住条件；拥有一个能保证保护人民健康的广大的医疗机构分布网。
    第五，各种族和民族平等的思想的胜利、各民族友好的思想的胜利。
    我们各苏维埃共和国是不是已具有一个先进的社会主义民族的这些特点呢？是的，它们已具有这些特点。
    让我们再来看一看事实。
    大家知道，沙皇制度是俄国各族人民的压迫者和刽子手。许多非俄罗斯民族都毫无权利可言。它们没有自己的国家，它们被沙皇官员统治着，一切机关中的事务都是通过当地民族所不懂的俄语来处理的。
    在苏维埃制度下，我国各族人民都建立了并发展了它们的国家。在苏维埃政权下，沙皇俄国的边境民族地区已经从殖民地与半殖民地变成真正独立的国家——苏维埃共和国。它们有自己的领土，有民族自治权，有自己的宪法、自己的法律。在加盟共和国、自治共和国、民族州、民族专区、民族区和民族村的权力机关、经济机关、行政机关和司法机关中，人民所选出的、通晓当地居民的生活方式、风俗习惯和心理的男女，正在用全体居民都懂得的当地语言管理着国家事务。
    任何资产阶级国家中都没有这种真正的民族平等。而这是可以理解的，因为在资本主义制度范围内消灭民族压迫是不可能的。大家都知道，资产阶级国家的整个国家行政体系就建筑在各种族和民族不平等、种族歧视和利用民族主义的偏见煽动各民族间的不和和冲突的基础上。在我们的时代，两个国家——美国和南非联邦——的种族和民族歧视特别厉害。
    一贯执行列宁—斯大林民族政策的苏联共产党和政府，在大力发展苏联整个国民经济的同时，使经济上落后的民族共和国获得了更迅速的发展。这便消除了苏联各族人民间过去的经济和文化不平等的情况。这无疑是苏维埃国家的民族政策的最重大的成就之一。
    各个苏维埃民族共和国的在发展上的成就，可以用许多令人信服的材料来说明，但我只举几个例子。
    在几个斯大林五年计划的年代中，冶金、石油及化学工业在苏维埃共和国中面貌一新；巨大的水电站，农业机器，拖拉机和汽车工厂，水泥厂，大纺织厂，食品工厂及许多其他工业机构都建立起来了。
    从东部各苏维埃共和国（乌兹别克、哈萨克、吉尔吉斯、土库曼和塔吉克等共和国）的例子中可以看出，民族共和国的工业，特别是大规模工业的发展比苏联从整个说来的工业发展还要快。这些共和国的大规模工业的产量，自一九二八年到一九五一年增加到二十二倍，而整个苏联在同一时期中只增加到十六倍。
    大家知道，不久以前，沙皇俄国东部边境地区的工业发展，和它们的邻国如土耳其、伊朗和阿富汗等国是没有什么区别的。
    在苏维埃时代，我们的中亚细亚各共和国在工业发展方面迅速地超过了与苏联为邻的东方各国，而且是远远地超过了它们。拿作为工业发展重要指标的电力来说，如果把上述的苏维埃共和国与若干东方国家加以比较，我们就可以看到：这五个共拥有约一千七百万人口的苏维埃共和国（乌兹别克、哈萨克、吉尔吉斯、土库曼、塔吉克）所生产的电力，为拥有一亿五千六百万人口的土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦、埃及、伊拉克、叙利亚及阿富汗各国总共生产的电力的三倍。（掌声）如果我们以一个苏维埃共和国，例如阿塞拜疆的电力产量来与土耳其比较，我们可以看出只拥有土耳其人口七分之一的苏维埃阿塞拜疆所生产的电力，为把头伸到美“援”圈套中的土耳其所生产的电力的四倍（全场哄然大笑）。
    我们的苏维埃共和国在发展方面还大大超过西欧的老的工业国家。例如，让我们以一个苏维埃共和国——乌克兰——与欧洲两个大的资产阶级国家——法国和意大利——来比较。当然，在这个例子中，并不是每件东西都可以比较的。大家知道：在乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国内，剥削阶级早已被消灭，工厂、工场、土地与所有劳动产品都成为人民的财产，失业情况已经一去不复返，一切权力全部属于人民。在这方面，资本家执政的法国和意大利早在三十多年以前就落在苏维埃乌克兰的后面了。（全场欢腾）因此，我们只能拿这些国家的某些最重要的经济统计数字来作比较。
    苏维埃乌克兰自从存在之日起曾经两度遭受外国的侵略，后来终于从侵略者留下的废墟和灰烬中复兴起来，现在它所生产的铣铁比法、意两国生产的总和还多得多；（掌声）它所生产的钢和压延金属超过了法国，为意大利的三倍有余；它所开采的煤为法、意两国开采量总和的一倍半；苏维埃乌克兰制造的拖拉机若用马力计算差不多为法、意两国总共制造的三倍；它所生产的谷物、马铃薯、甜菜和糖比法、意两国总共生产的还多得多。
    由于社会主义工业和集体农业的发展，乌克兰人民过着繁荣的生活，享受着文化方面的一切福利，而法国和意大利的劳苦大众是被剥夺了这些的。
    波罗的海沿岸各苏维埃共和国在建立了苏维埃制度后在经济上获得的迅速发展也同样可以说明问题。把立陶宛、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚三个加盟共和国与挪威、荷兰、比利时比较一下就可看出，三个苏维埃共和国的工业发展速度远远超过了上述欧洲资本主义国家的工业发展速度。
    到一九五二年初，立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国的工业生产水平，已提高到战前水平的二点四倍；拉脱维亚共和国三点六倍，爱沙尼亚共和国四点一倍；而在同一时期，挪威、荷兰、比利时的工业生产水平只稍稍超过了战前，而在战争中这几个苏维埃共和国的经济所受的破坏要大得多。
    值得指出的是：在旧的资本主义拉脱维亚，甚至根据经过当时的统治者窜改过的数字来看，从一九一三年到一九三九年（即在二十六个年头中），工业生产只增加到一点五倍；而在新的苏维埃拉脱维亚，从一九四○年到一九五一年（即在十一个年头中），尽管还有战争和敌军占领的蹂躏，工业生产已增加到三点六倍。
    农业发展上的成就也是一样的巨大。
    苏联集体农场制度的胜利使得各苏维埃共和国的农业稳步上升。集体农场制度是苏维埃政权所获得的最大成就之一，因为这种制度把农民群众吸收来建设社会主义，为一切农业生产部门的发展开辟了新的空前未有的机会，而且创造了不断改进千百万农民的物质与文化水平的条件。
    因此，现在我们在所有的苏维埃共和国里，都有了大规模的社会主义农业，进行着大量的商品生产，广泛地应用着农艺学上的最新成就，有着比其他任何国家的农业装备都要好的新式农业装备。
    这种情形，在苏联的每一个共和国里都可以看到。但是，现在我要再来专谈东部各共和国在这方面的情况，大家知道，在苏维埃政府建立前，那些地区的农业是全国最落后的，没有任何种类的农业机器，甚至连最简单的农业机器也没有。
    现在，在乌兹别克、哈萨克、吉尔吉斯、土库曼和塔吉克这几个苏维埃社会主义共和国的集体农场和国家农场的田野上，有着十二万一千台拖拉机（以十五匹马力为单位），两万三千台联合收割机，十万二千台播种、培育和采摘棉花的机器和几十万台其他种类的农业机器和工具。
    东部各苏维埃共和国的农业机器装备远远超过欧洲最发达的资本主义国家。（掌声）
    以拖拉机的供应为例，在乌兹别克苏维埃社会主义共和国，平均每一千公顷的耕地面积就有十四台拖拉机。而在法国，同样大的耕地只有七台马力小得多的拖拉机；在意大利，同样大的耕地，只有四台马力小得多的拖拉机。不待说，东方其他国家的拖拉机的数目就更是微不足道了。乌兹别克苏维埃社会主义共和国每七十公顷的耕地面积就有一台拖拉机，而巴基斯坦每九千公顷才有一台拖拉机，印度每一万三千公顷才有一台，伊朗每一万八千公顷才有一台。
    社会主义农业获得了大批机器的配备，已经大大减轻了农民的劳动，再加上现代的科学耕作方法和广泛地发展灌溉工作，就保证了丰收。
    以棉花为例，棉花是东方各苏维埃共和国发达的多样性的农业的主要工业作物之一，这些共和国一九五一年原棉的单位面积产量平均每公顷为二十一生丁纳。
    世界上没有那一个产棉国家能比得上苏联植棉者所获得的单位面积产量。在同一年——一九五一年，埃及棉花的单位面积产量是每公顷十一点五生丁纳，美国为八点三生丁纳，印度为三点四生丁纳，巴基斯坦为五点二生丁纳，土耳其为七点二生丁纳，伊朗为四点五生丁纳。
    应该考虑到，苏联东部各共和国的棉田面积很大，这从上述各共和国产棉量等于印度、埃及、伊朗、土耳其和阿富汗产棉量总和一事就可以看出。
    （掌声）
    这就是关于苏联各民族共和国经济发展的一些事实。它们表明，这些共和国的经济正在继续不断地增长和发展，没有任何危机和不景气现象。最后，这些事实表明了摆脱帝国主义束缚和从地主及资本家的统治中解放出来的人民，能够获得多大的成就。（掌声）
    为了在苏维埃民族共和国中建立先进的社会主义经济，那就必须消灭各共和国大部分地区中的文化落后现象，在最广泛规模上促进文化发展，建立广泛的以本民族语言教学的初等学校和中等学校网，从新组织高等教育制度，大规模地训练各民族的熟练工人、工程师、技术人员、农学家、牲畜饲养专家、教师和医生。
    由于实施列宁—斯大林民族政策的结果，苏联各族人民完成了一个真正的文化革命。
    目前，两百多万工程和技术人员在工业建设和运输方面进行工作；约有四十万农业学家、牲畜饲养专家与造林及其他专家从事农业工作；将近两百万教师和讲师在学校、技术学校和高等教育机关中工作；城市和乡村卫生机关差不多有三十万医师和九十万医生、助理医生、看护和其他的医务人员。每一个苏维埃共和国现在已有几十万受过高等教育的专家。
    各苏维埃共和国已建立了一系列的高等教育机关和技术学校，训练当地各民族的苏维埃知识分子干部。当苏维埃政权成立时，我国的高等教育机关共有九十六所，其中除去极其少数外，大部分都设立在俄罗斯的主要中心城市。这些学校的学生共十一万七千名。
    现在苏联共有高等教育机关八百八十七所，学生一百四十万名。现在乌克兰的学生有二十一万六千名，中亚细亚各苏维埃共和国十万零四千名，外高加索各共和国八万名，白俄罗斯三万五千名，波罗的海各共和国共三万七千名。
    各苏维埃共和国在高等教育发展方面不仅已大大地超过了国外的东方国家而且还大大地超过了西欧国家。
    例如，现在塔吉克受高等教育的学生每一万居民中即有五十八名，土库曼六十名，吉尔吉斯六十四名，乌兹别克七十一名，阿塞拜疆九十三名。然而，在伊朗每一万人中受高等教育的只有三名，印度九名，埃及与土耳其十二名，瑞典二十一名，意大利三十二名，丹麦三十四名，法国三十六名。
    自从苏维埃政府成立以来，四十八个民族已经创造了他们自己的文字，并且用他们本民族语文印行了教科书、书籍和报纸。在过去三十年之内，苏联各共和国建立了约九万所设备完善的学校，其中差不多有三分之二都分设在各民族的加盟共和国以及自治共和国之内。随着社会主义经济的发展，苏联各族人民的福利也一年年地提高了。在所有的苏维埃共和国，职工的实际工资以及农民的收入都大大提高了。在一九四零年到一九五一年之间，职工及农民的收入的总和增加了百分之七十八。
    苏维埃国家在保护我国各族人民的健康方面作了许多工作。为人民准备的充裕的医疗服务就是一个证明。我将列举某些苏维埃共和国的实例来说明这一点。
    在苏维埃政府成立以前，乌兹别克每三万一千人只有一个医生，那种情况和巴基斯坦今天的情况相差不多。现在乌兹别克苏维埃社会主义共和国每八百九十五人就有一个医生。乌兹别克苏维埃社会主义共和国在医生的人数方面，如果和埃及比较起来，就强了不知多少倍，埃及每四千三百五十人才有一个医生；同时，如与西欧相比，也胜过西欧好些国家，例如在法国每千人有一个医生，在荷兰每一千一百六十人才有一个医生。
    在阿塞拜疆苏维埃社会主义共和国，每四百九十个人有一个医生。因此，在医疗服务方面，苏维埃阿塞拜疆的人民比土耳其人民强七倍半，比伊朗人民强二十二倍。在格鲁吉亚苏维埃社会主义共和国，每三百七十三个人有一个医生，在亚美尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国，每四百八十三人有一个医生，这两个共和国的人民所享有的医疗服务比世界上任何国家的人民都强。但是各苏维埃共和国的人民不仅是有大量医生随时为他们服务。要了解全面情况，必须记住，在苏联，人民都是免费享受各种医疗服务的，每年有千百万劳动人民到疗养院和休养所去，而在资产阶级国家里，医疗服务大都是要付钱的，而且是很贵的。因此，医疗服务是广大的劳动人民的财力所不及的，而在那些国家里，到休养区和疗养院去是寄生剥削者的特权。
    在苏维埃社会制度和国家制度下，社会主义民族的发展，各民族间经济和文化上的不平等的真正消除，各民族在保卫苏维埃国家，防御外国敌人的入侵和建立社会主义过程中的经久合作，使得民族平等的思想、各民族间友好的思想在我们国家内稳固地建立了起来，而且取得了完全的胜利。
    我国各族人民之间的友谊已经经过多次考验。各族人民友谊之巩固的一次最大考验是反对希特勒匪帮联盟的战争。
    在伟大的卫国战争以后，我国各族人民间的友谊在恢复曾经遭受敌人占领的边疆区的社会主义经济时期，又有了充满新的力量的表现。全体苏联人民都全心全意地参加了恢复被占领过的各共和国与各州经济的工作，因为他们认为这个工作是对他们有重大关系的事情，也是对国家有重大关系的迫切任务。有哪一个资产阶级国家的人民能这样地互相援助呢？
    现在，随着苏联逐渐从社会主义过渡到共产主义，苏联各族人民的友谊已经在发展的过程中获得了新的内容。各苏维埃共和国所达到的高度经济与文化水平，已经为它们更积极地参与解决整个国家的重大问题创造了可能性。
    把我国各族人民的友谊集合起来的力量是俄罗斯人民、俄罗斯民族——苏联一切民族中最杰出的民族。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    在一九一七年十月，俄国工人阶级在列宁斯大林党的领导下完成了最伟大的具有历史意义的业绩：它突破了世界帝国主义的阵线，摧毁了资产阶级的力量，并且粉碎了压在占世界六分之一土地的人民身上的民族—殖民压迫的枷锁。无疑的，没有俄罗斯工人阶级的帮助，我国各族人民就不能抵抗白卫军和干涉军，就不能建设社会主义。至于以前没有经过资本主义发展阶段的各民族，如果没有俄罗斯工人阶级的长期不断的、有系统的帮助，他们就不可能由资本主义以前的经济形态过渡到社会主义。
    斯大林同志曾经说过，俄罗斯族人民所固有的开朗的胸襟、忠实的性格和忍耐力，在伟大的卫国战争期间有了特别有力的表现。由于他们的英雄主义、勇气和果敢，俄罗斯族人民在这次战争中赢得了普遍的赞扬，被认为是我国各个民族中间的领导苏联的力量。（长时间的掌声）
    效法着俄罗斯族人民的榜样，我国一切其他民族和俄罗斯民族肩并肩地以自我牺牲的精神对敌人作战；它们和俄罗斯族人民相同，都是我们打败希特勒德国与帝国主义日本的胜利的缔造者。我国各族人民向世界证明：以各民族的斯大林式友谊为基础的苏维埃社会主义多民族国家具有一种强大而不可战胜的力量。
    共同的切身利益，是我国各民族间的友谊的基础。苏联的各民族团结一致的因素，是他们捍卫在苏维埃政府下获得的自由、独立、幸福的生活，使之不受任何敌人的侵犯的意愿和决心；他们团结一致的因素是他们建设共产主义社会的共同努力。我国人民清楚知道，由于牢不可破的斯大林友谊而团结在单一的苏维埃国家——共和国联盟——中，他们就是不可战胜的，能够胜利地建设共产主义和保卫他们的果实，使之免受任何危险。
    我们的党和斯大林同志本人一直在注意保证苏维埃的民族政策得到正确的执行。在对列宁主义的敌人进行的斗争中，党胜利地执行了列宁—斯大林民族政策，保证最后彻底击败大民族沙文主义、资产阶级民族主义和资产阶级世界主义。
    我们的党的领袖斯大林同志的伟大贡献是，他的英明领导保证了我国各族人民的物质和精神力量的真正复活和空前高涨（掌声），把他们团结在牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊中，并指导他们朝着一个伟大的目标——我们国家的力量的加强和共产主义的胜利——努力。（经久不息的掌声）
    在统一的、多民族的苏维埃国家制度下所获得的社会主义民族发展方面的胜利，是具有伟大的国际意义的。我们的榜样给资本主义国家的工人阶级指出了他们从被剥削、贫困和失业的情况中、从日益增加的法西斯主义的危险中求得解放的道路。
    我们的榜样给殖民地和附属国的人民指出了从被压迫和被奴役走向自由与独立、从各民族纷争和仇恨走向各民族兄弟般友好、从饥饿和贫困走向繁荣的生活、从愚昧和文化落后走向文化、科学和艺术欣欣向荣的道路。
    整个历史过程已一再证实了我们党的领袖斯大林同志的话：“我们现在到了这样的阶段：社会主义能成为（并且已开始成为！）帝国主义下的广大殖民地国家中千百万群众解放的旗帜。”
    自由和民族独立的思想、社会主义的思想已深入到被奴役国家的最偏僻的角落里了。
    为争取解放而斗争的人民知道：伟大的和平民主阵营是站在他们方面的；苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家正在捍卫和平、自由、独立和一切种族与民族的真正平等，这些国家的存在本身就制止了反动派的黑暗势力，从而使得被压迫民族的斗争易于进行。
    美国和其他资产阶级国家的统治集团，在日益高涨的民族解放运动面前显得如此的软弱无力，于是他们就叫嚷说：被压迫人民对他们的压迫者进行的斗争是苏联在东方宣传的结果。
    倒霉的资产阶级政客们可以从许多年前斯大林同志说的话中找到答案。斯大林同志说：“人们指责我们在东方进行宣传……我们是不需要在东方进行宣传的。附属国或殖民地的任何公民，只要来到苏联，就可以看到我们是如何治理国家的，黑种人和白种人、俄罗斯人和非俄罗斯人、各种肤色和各民族的人民是如何担当着工作和共同治理着一个伟大的国家的。这样就可以使他相信：我们的国家是各民族的友爱已成为现实而不是一句空话的唯一的国家。苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的存在这种事实的宣传，我们就根本不需要文字的或口头的宣传。”
    （经久不息的掌声）
    人民民主国家在建设它们的新的生活时，正在吸取在建设与巩固多民族的苏维埃国家时所获得的丰富经验。
    民主国家之间的关系是一种完全新型的关系，这种关系是人类历史上前所未有的。这种关系的主要特点建立在这样的基础上：
    与帝国主义的命令和奴役他国人民的政策相反，所有大小国家一律享有真正的完全平等，保卫每个国家的各项主权和独立，不干涉他国的内部事务；
    与帝国主义国家所实行的秘密订约、阴谋捣鬼、明争暗斗的政策相反，各国彼此尊重民族利益，各国人民之间彼此信赖友爱；
    与帝国主义阵营内部进行的竞相夺取原料和市场的激烈斗争相反，各国进行密切的经济合作与互助，完全依照每个国家的民族利益来保障发展经济的最有利的条件；
    与帝国主义的使经济军事化、策动和加速另一次世界大战、并向劳动人民的生活水平进攻的政策相反，民主国家共同努力保卫和平，恢复与发展一切国家之间的经济与文化关系，不论其经济与社会制度如何，以便改进全世界所有国家的亿万人民的生活。
    帝国主义阵营内的国与国之间的关系的特点是，美国资本有一种妄想统治全世界的、贪得无餍的欲望。美帝国主义在全世界各地密布罗网以后，就像一只永远不知餍足的蜘蛛一样，吸尽许多民族和国家的脂血，并且不惜使用一切手段来奴役他们。最惯用的方法是在所谓美“援”的掩饰下进行奴役。当一国获得美“援”时，它就马上丧失了它的主权和独立，变为一个附属国。这样的国家最多能盼望充当一个不平等的伙伴。
    现在充当美国的这样一个不平等伙伴的，就是一度被称为“海上霸王”和“世界工厂”的英国。美帝国主义正日益使英国得不到原料和市场，并用各种方法把它从欧洲和亚洲赶出去，一个接一个地把它的据点抢夺了去。现在已达到这样的地步：美国甚至毫不客气地拒绝了英国政府所提出的最起码的要求，拒绝让它派一名观察员参加美国和英国自治领新西兰和澳大利亚所举行的关于所谓太平洋公约的谈判。关于这一点，甚至英国的保守派报纸最近也沉痛地抱怨，说英国被当作一个受人申斥、轻视或看不起的穷亲戚看待了。（全场哄然大笑）保守派报纸之一“每日邮报”坦白说道，假如英国忽而在这里失去一个据点，忽而又在那里失去一个据点，那么不久它就没有可以丧失的了。（全场大笑）英国统治集团是不会不明白这一点的；但他们仍继续唯美国之命是从，还鼓起腮巴装胖子。（全场哄然大笑）
    美国的帝国主义者头子们正把他们所奴役的国家变成侵略战争的桥头堡，正在要那些国家的青年充当炮灰。这样，那些已经依赖美国的国家就一步一步地走上了致命的战争道路。
    美帝国主义已经成为世界反动势力的支柱和堡垒，不论在什么地方资本主义面临危险，它就拚命去挽救它，不论在什么地方殖民统治和最反动的政权受到民族解放运动和民主革命的威胁，它就拚命去维持这种殖民统治和这些最反动的政权。它正在轻率地步德国法西斯主义的后尘，要它的士兵成为压迫爱好自由人民的警察和刽子手。依赖美国的国家里的人民将举国一致抵抗美国干涉他们的生活，把这些不速之客赶出他们的国家去，是十分自然的。他们正以燃烧的仇恨回敬美国人，因为美国人侮辱了他们民族的光荣和尊严。
    而美国人民呢，尽管有人天天向他们灌输骗人的思想，说有一种外国威胁存在，他们仍然开始认识到这种宣传的荒谬绝伦；而在越来越大的军事支出的重压下，他们对于美国统治集团目前的政策，也越来越表示不满。
    同志们，我们党在第十九次代表大会上必须报告的主要成就便是苏联已获致了无比的力量和国际威信。我们之所以获致这种成就是因为实行了把我国从农业国变为先进的工业国的工业化政策；是因为实行了把我们的农业变为世界上最进步的大规模机械化农业的集体化政策；是因为始终遵守了列宁—斯大林民族政策——一个促成苏联各族人民牢不可破的团结与友爱的政策；是因为始终不渝地遵循了斯大林的旨在维护国际和平的外交政策。我国各族人民的福利和文化已经达到了很高的水平。
    历史告诉我们：我国在苏维埃时代三十五年中所达到的工业成就，资本主义国家要花几个世纪才能达到。在苏维埃年代，苏联的工业产量增加到三十九倍，英国花了一百六十二年（从一七九零年到一九五一年）才做到这一步，法国工业生产在过去的九十年中，增加到不足五点五倍。至于美国，它的工业产量在过去三十五年中只增加到二点六倍。这个社会主义国家所以能在史无前例的短短的期间获得了这样的成绩，是因为苏维埃制度为苏联经济与文化迅速发展开辟了空前的可能性，是因为领导我国人民为社会主义斗争的，是知道应当做些什么而又不为困难所屈服的共产党。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们国家走到社会主义胜利的道路不是一条容易的道路。在这条道路上，内部和外部的困难和障碍不在少数，但是我们的党经常处于随时都可以动员起来的状态，而且已经顺利地克服了这些困难和障碍。现在我们面对着重大而复杂的共产主义建设问题，我们的党、领导苏维埃国家的党，必须预见到种种困难，并且充分武装起来，以领导人民克服这些困难。我们深信，列宁和斯大林所创立和培养的我们的党将永远能够胜任它的伟大任务。（掌声）
    斯大林同志与伟大的列宁一道建立并巩固了我们的党，在一九一七年十月领导俄国工人阶级进攻资本主义，建立了世界上第一个苏维埃国家。在伟大的列宁逝世后，二十五年多以来，斯大林同志一直领导着我们的党和苏联人民沿着建立新的共产主义的生活的创造性的道路前进。在这条道路的每一个新阶段，斯大林同志都在理论上武装我们的党，教导我们的党预见事件的进一步发展，并集中我们党的力量来解决主要的问题。
    斯大林同志在他的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”里进一步发展了马克思—列宁主义理论，这是党的思想生活中的一件重大事件。
    斯大林同志在他的著作中所提出的原则和结论，是特别重要的，因为它们为马克思—列宁主义科学的发展开辟了新的一章，而且与苏联的共产主义社会建设的主要任务有不可分割的关系。大家知道，马克思和恩格斯把社会主义从空想变为科学。伟大的列宁发展了马克思主义，他创造了关于社会主义国家及在我国建设没有阶级的社会主义社会的方法的学说。党在斯大林同志的领导下把这个学说应用到生活中去，获得了划时代的胜利：社会主义已从人类最伟大思想家的梦想变为现实。苏联人民已建设了社会主义社会，我国已进入了从社会主义社会逐渐过渡到共产主义社会的时期。
    在这种情况下，我们的党遇到了有关马克思—列宁主义学说的新问题。要完成由社会主义过渡到共产主义的事业必须创造一些什么必要条件呢？为了达到这个目的需要做些什么事情呢？什么是主宰着这个重要的历史时期的基本自然法则呢？我们看见斯大林同志对于这一切与我们苏维埃社会前进有关的非常重要的迫切问题如何提出了清楚明晰的答案，这些答案为党和苏联人民照亮了前面的道路。
    毫无疑问，我们的代表大会和我们整个的党将把斯大林同志关于完成由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义事业的条件和方法的指示，当作他们建设共产主义的战斗纲领而予以接受。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）
    我们党和全体苏联人民以极大的热情迎接着这个斯大林纲领。这个纲领引起了苏联人民最美好的希望，并鼓舞他们为了伟大的列宁—斯大林思想的胜利去完成新的英雄的业绩。（掌声）
    我们在共产主义道路上的胜利前进，将成为各国工人阶级和劳动人民在他们为和平、民主和社会主义而从事的革命斗争中得到鼓舞的无穷源泉。
    在第十九次代表大会的这些历史性的日子里，团结紧密的苏维埃人民空前坚固地团结在他们自己的共产党的周围，并准备为他们祖国的光荣创造新的劳动业绩。（掌声）
    我国各族人民可以相信：以马克思—列宁主义理论武装的共产党，在斯大林同志指导之下将领导我国走向理想的目标——共产主义。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声。全体起立。）
