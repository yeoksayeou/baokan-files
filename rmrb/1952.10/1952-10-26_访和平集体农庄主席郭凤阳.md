Visiting Guo Fengyang, Chairman of the Heping Collective Farm
　　Yan Ling

Guo Fengyang, Chairman of the Heping Collective Farm, came to Beijing to participate in the grand celebrations of the Third National Day, carrying the honor and joy of all the collective farmers in the farm. His days in Beijing coincided with the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Everywhere were bright slogans of "Defend Peace" and resounding shouts of "Long Live Peace." All of this made Guo Fengyang even more excited and encouraged. He said to the reporter: "Peace" is truly a glorious name! We must run our collective farm even better and ensure that we do not disgrace this good name.

The Heping Collective Farm was established in April of this year, located in Heping Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province. Before 1948, this village was not called Heping Village, but Linjingyuetun. For the peasants, this was a name full of bitterness and resentment, because Lin Jingyue was a big landlord who monopolized everything in the village and forcibly imposed his stinky name on the village. One can imagine what kind of life the peasants lived.

In August 1945, the Soviet Red Army sent troops to Northeast China and rescued the people of Northeast China from hell. From 1947 to 1948, the Communist Party led the local peasants to carry out land reform, uprooting the rule of the landlord class. At the celebration meeting for the victory of the struggle, the peasants decided to change Linjingyuetun to Heping Village. The peasants said: "The Communist Party leads us in the struggle to let everyone live a peaceful life; the Soviet Red Army drove away the Japanese devils for the sake of peace. If we maintain peace, we can live better and better." This spring, the peasants in this village took another step forward, and 108 households organized a collective farm. What should the collective farm be called? After much discussion, it was finally decided to call it "Peace."

Good Harvest, Good Life

Guo Fengyang talked about the good harvest of their collective farm with a victorious smile. Their farm has nearly 700 hectares (one hectare equals one hectare, equivalent to 15 mu) of land (including more than 80 hectares of newly reclaimed wasteland), most of which is planted with wheat (spring wheat) and soybeans, and a small part is planted with millet, sorghum, corn, and vegetables. Although the wheat suffered from blight, the average yield per hectare was still more than three shi (about 500 jin of wheat per shi); more than ten hectares of high-yield land yielded more than six shi per hectare (before liberation, local wheat yielded only a little more than two shi per hectare, and from 1948 to 1951, the average yield per hectare was about two shi five dou, and the good yield could reach more than four shi). The average yield of soybeans per hectare is more than eight shi
(Each shi of soybeans is also about 500 jin), and more than a dozen hectares of high-yield land can yield more than ten shi per hectare (before liberation, local soybeans could only yield more than three shi per hectare, and from 1948 to 1951, the average yield per hectare was about seven to eight shi). This year, the average yield of millet per hectare is eleven shi (about 460 jin of millet per shi), and the best yield can reach fifteen shi per hectare (before liberation, local millet could only yield three or four shi per hectare, and from 1948 to 1951, the average yield per hectare was about five shi to seven shi). This year, the average yield of corn per hectare is about thirteen shi (about 440 jin of corn per shi), and more than eight hectares of high-yield land can yield more than twenty shi per hectare (before liberation, local corn generally yielded only about five shi per hectare, and from 1948 to 1951, the average yield per hectare was about ten shi). The yield of all crops has increased compared to before the establishment of the collective farm, and of course it has increased even more than before liberation. Before liberation, it was considered good if a local poor peasant could get ten shi of grain per year for each labor force. From 1948 to 1951, the average annual income per labor force was fifteen to twenty shi of grain; this year, after the establishment of the collective farm, those who worked well can earn thirty shi of grain per person; the least can also earn twenty shi of grain. Zhuang Yuanzhang Cai is a good "labor"; he has a horse and seven hectares of land. Last year, in the mutual aid group, he only earned twenty-four shi of grain in a year; this year, he can earn more than thirty shi of grain.

Now, the collective property of the farm has 136 horses, 23 carts, and five sets of new-style horse-drawn agricultural implements. They paid attention to developing animal husbandry from the beginning, and this year they have raised 139 cattle, 130 sheep, and more than 60 pigs, which are centrally raised by a livestock group. Several years ago, more than 80 households who joined the farm used a tattered quilt for two or three people. This year, before the wheat was harvested, the supply and marketing cooperative signed a contract with the farm and gave the farm members more than 12,000 feet of good cloth on credit. The farm members had already prepared their winter cotton clothes early, and everyone had a quilt; the women made new skirts and added many brightly colored cloth shirts. A few years ago, people often didn't have enough to eat, let alone go to school. Now, there are already more than 110 children in the entire farm attending elementary school, and six children are studying in middle school in the county. The entire farm subscribed to 49 copies of newspapers and some magazines. Some of these newspapers and periodicals are subscribed to by the farm management committee, some are subscribed to by the production teams, and some are subscribed to by each household.

The material and cultural life of the collective farm is rising day by day. This is only the first year, but it is just the beginning. Guo Fengyang said that they do not plan to build beautiful houses immediately; they want to put the greatest strength into developing production. They first want to add new agricultural tools and good fertilizers. In terms of construction, they have already bought a lot of wood this year and plan to build a brick kiln next year, first to build a place to raise livestock, and then to build a public meeting room. As for the residences of the farm members, they will talk about it in the future. The farm members all agree with this approach. They know that as long as production is done well, they are not afraid of not having good houses to live in.

From Individual Economy to Collective Economy through Mutual Aid and Cooperation

There is happiness in collective farms, and most people already understand this principle. However, to bring peasants who have lived in an individual economy for thousands of years to this happy paradise, to establish the collective ownership economy of the collective farm, one must not be impatient. It must be rooted very deeply and steadily, and it must constantly fight against the backward, dispersed individual economic thinking that invades it. The Heping Collective Farm is developing according to this law. In the first year after land reform, 1948, there were eight permanent mutual aid groups in the village. In 1949, the number of permanent mutual aid groups increased to ten, three of which had new-style agricultural implements. In 1950, these ten mutual aid groups were further expanded and consolidated, with each group developing to 15 to 19 households. In 1951, there were 12 such mutual aid groups, five of which had public new-style agricultural implements, and each group accumulated some public property. Two mutual aid group leaders were elected as agricultural labor models of the province. In the twelfth lunar month of last year, two agricultural production cooperatives were established in the village, and the mutual aid groups also had new developments. Only three "solo" peasants remained in the village. The party and Youth League organizational foundation of this village is also relatively good; before the establishment of the farm, there were a total of 39 party members (now there are 42), and 40 Youth League members (now there are more than 90). Most of the party members participated in training classes organized by the county's leading organs and received a relatively systematic education on the future of social development. This spring, they also conducted widespread publicity and education work on the two paths of rural development among the masses in the village. This place is close to state-owned farms, and many peasants have seen the benefits of large-scale farming with their own eyes, and it is also convenient to use the farm's machines for farming. When the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives was brewing in the twelfth lunar month of last year, the majority of the masses were full of enthusiasm for this further move towards collectivization; they quickly fed the livestock together and concentrated the grass used for fodder. The leaders of Heilongjiang Province studied the situation in this village and decided to pilot a collective farm in this village (Heilongjiang Province piloted two collective farms, the other is called "Xinsheng" Collective Farm, in Nenjiang County), as a living example to guide peasants to collectivization through mutual aid and cooperation.

Heping Village has a total of five administrative villages (including eight natural villages), of which three villages (Center Village, Northeast Village, Unity Village) have the best work foundation. The collective farm was piloted in these three villages. Some important situations of this collective farm are different from the "Spark" Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province. The land, agricultural tools, and houses of the "Spark" Collective Farm were initially supplied by the state. The land, draft animals, agricultural tools, and other means of production of the "Heping" Collective Farm were transformed from private to public ownership of the collective farm; before the establishment of the farm, 66 percent of the 108 households lived a middle peasant life. In order to take care of the original private economic foundation of the peasants, to take care of the interests of the middle peasants who joined the farm, and to stabilize the enthusiasm of individual peasants outside the farm to expand production, they adopted the method of averaging shares based on labor force. The original land, draft animals, vehicles, main agricultural tools, seeds, fodder, etc. of the farm members
are all converted into the collective ownership of the collective farm at a price. The farm averages the total value of the property handed over by all farm members based on the number of all farm members (both male and female laborers who are 16 years old or older can participate in the farm as formal farm members) as the share capital that each farm member should pay. If the actual value of the property handed over by the farm member exceeds the specified share capital, the farm will return it to the individual within two years. If the share capital is insufficient, the full amount will be paid within two years. Regardless of whether it is a refund or a supplementary payment, interest will be earned or paid at the agricultural loan interest rate of the bank. Farm members retain their own vegetable garden land; three mu for families with three or fewer people, four mu for four to five people, and five mu for six or more people. Farm members have the right to use the vegetable garden land, but cannot rent, sell, or transfer it. Horses, regardless of size, are owned by the collective farm. As long as each household pays the share capital, it can keep
one large cow and one small calf; each household can freely raise pigs and poultry.

The collective farm distributes the income of the farm according to the number of labor days that farm members work in the farm. At the beginning of planting wheat, they determined the labor days based on the complexity, lightness, and quantity of the work. For example, sowing seeds requires certain skills, and carrying seed bags requires effort, so one day of work is recorded as 1.2 labor days; plowing is recorded as one full labor day; the work of supporting the small puller (soil covering tool) is light, so it is recorded as 0.7 labor days. However, because the technical difference in plowing with wooden plows is not large, everyone wants to do a full labor day's work. People who cannot do well in sowing and plowing also compete to sow and plow, and are unwilling to do light work and fragmented work. Therefore, the method was changed later: the farm management committee determined the labor day quota for various jobs according to the general work efficiency of the farm members, and contracted them to the farming teams (the entire farm is divided into six farming teams, two in each village) using the contract system; if the tasks assigned to the farm by the farm are completed in less than the quota time, they are still calculated according to the originally assigned labor day quota. The land, draft animals, vehicles, and agricultural tools used by each team are fixed and do not change without special needs. If the original output is exceeded on the fixed plot of land, the entire team will be rewarded with physical objects. When each team assigns tasks to farm members, labor days are not temporarily calculated according to the complexity, lightness, and weight of the work, but are evaluated once each season according to the labor strength, technical level, and "fixed points" of each farm member. After a period of work is completed, a "live evaluation" is carried out according to the actual labor achievements and labor attitude of each person. In the future, when various jobs can and must be divided into grades to determine reasonable quotas, after the masses are familiar with the method of calculating labor days, this scoring method can be abolished and labor days can be calculated directly.

The distribution of the total income of the farm is temporarily stipulated as follows: in addition to paying agricultural tax, 3% of the total income is used as public accumulation funds to purchase agricultural tools, livestock, and carry out public construction; 1% of the total income is used as welfare funds to help the elderly, disabled, families of martyrs and military personnel who temporarily lack labor force, and subsidize temporary nurseries within the farm; seeds and fodder are left according to the needs of the second year, and no fixed proportion is specified; farm office expenses, public newspaper and magazine expenses, etc., are stipulated to not exceed 1% of the total income; expenses for repairing agricultural tools, purchasing fertilizers and pesticides, and insurance premiums are paid according to actual needs.

The Struggle between Collectivism and Individualism

Even with a better foundation, the collective farm cannot be established smoothly. Because mutual aid and cooperation are still based on the individual economy; it is still not a simple matter to transform from a peasant participating in mutual aid and cooperation into a collective peasant. When the collective farm was about to be established, the rich peasants spread rumors saying that the collective farm would distribute the grain equally after the harvest; they also said that after being busy until autumn, everyone would only get half of the grain, and the public would take away half. Some old ladies listened to the words of the saboteurs and also clamored, saying: after that, eating and wearing will not be free, we have to eat what we have to eat, and wear what we have to wear. The hens will have to turn in all their eggs and won't be able to buy even a needle and thread for themselves. Some families had quarrels over the question of whether or not to participate. The more affluent peasants were uneasy, and some people couldn't sleep all night considering whether or not to join the farm. Wang Huaiyi specially called his son Wang Hongsheng (a communist party member) who was studying in the city back to ask if joining the farm was a good thing. Wang Hongsheng said: We've been looking forward to it, how could it not be a good thing? Wang Huaiyi wanted to keep a horse for his own use, but his son also dissuaded him. After his son explained it to him, he learned that the collective farm had a bright future, and he was very happy to join. When he was leading his horse to have its value assessed, many people were particularly "conflicted" in their thinking. Because the price of horses was expensive when they bought them in the past, and the value was assessed according to the current market price when they joined the farm, which was lower than in the past, they thought they were "losing money" and didn't want to bring their horses out. The party members took the lead in pulling their horses out for everyone to evaluate without any hesitation, and carefully calculated the accounts and talked about the future for those who had concerns. In the end, everyone converted their horses into public property. The working group sent by the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party relied on the party members, Youth League members, and village cadres of Heping Village, and held many discussion meetings in villages and districts to explain the specific methods of running the collective farm to everyone, debunked the rumors of the saboteurs one by one, and dispelled the ideological concerns of many people. As a result, 108 of the 120 households in the three villages joined the farm, except for 10 households (some wanted to "wait and see, and then join if it's really good", some were afraid of suffering losses because of their weak labor force, and two households were landlords and were not approved to participate).

The contradictions and struggles between collectivist and individualist thought continued to take place after the farm was established. Guo Fengyang said that after the farm was established, no major detours were taken, but minor problems occurred constantly. The ideological problems of some people were not truly solved when they joined the farm. They were swept in by "following the trend" and "riding the wave", and the ideological struggle did not stop after they joined the farm. In particular, the relatively affluent households had "conflicts" in their hearts at every period. They thought: although their property has been priced and turned into public property, and they have hundreds of thousands of yuan left over, there is still no guarantee how it will be given to them in the future. Although it is said that it will be paid off within two years, and interest will be calculated, who knows if it will "change"? Some people are afraid that they will not harvest much grain in the autumn; those with weak labor are afraid that even if a lot of grain is harvested, they will not get much; the poor households who are short of share capital when they join the farm are afraid that they will not be able to make up the share capital after the autumn, and they are also afraid that eating and wearing will be a problem after they make up the share capital. In short, many people are still "not clear", so they are not very motivated in production; they take the attitude of "carrying big work", and only do what the captain tells them to do; some people are unwilling to work, so they pretend to have a stomachache and a headache. When planting land, some people only pay attention to their own small garden plots and are not concerned enough about the farm's farmland; a few people secretly send the manure that has already been turned into public property to their own garden plots. Some people also want to keep some "backups" and leave some when they turn in seeds to the farm; as a result, there were not enough wheat seeds, and some seeds were borrowed from the government to meet the needs of sowing. Lin Jingfeng used to have ten hectares of land and four horses, and only one labor force; in the past, he mostly relied on exchanging his horses for other people's labor, and he did not work much and did not harvest less grain; after joining the farm, he would be recorded as being absent from work if he did not work, and he would get less grain, so his thinking has always been wavering. Zhou Mingli's mare gave birth to a foal after it became public property of the collective farm, and he cried bitterly, complaining that his brother should not have persuaded him to join the farm. In the early period, some people did not take care of public property, and there was a phenomenon that "no one helped even if the oil bottle fell over." Some people think: the public property is all mine, and it is not all mine; it is all mine when I use it, and it is not mine when I take care of it. Because they were not taken care of well enough, two big horses and three foals died of illness. Several hundred whip tips were broken in one spring. Some women borrowed money from the management committee to buy a straw hat when they went to the fields to work; some people asked the management committee for subsidies even if they had a little illness. Some of these phenomena occurred because the system was not strict enough or reasonable enough, but the most fundamental reason was still the individualism at work, and the education of collectivism was not enough. The problems occurred most in the two teams of Unity Village, because the work foundation of this village was relatively weak among the three villages. Guo Fengyang said: From this fact, it can also be seen that collectivization cannot be impatient and must be done step by step; it is not possible for some cadres to blindly "ride the wave" and want to leap up in one step.

The most serious task facing the leading cadres of the farm and the local party organization is to strengthen ideological education and use collectivist ideas to overcome the deep-rooted individualist ideas that have grown on the basis of the individual economy for thousands of years. They were not frightened by the many bad phenomena mentioned above, but they did not underestimate these phenomena. They knew that the task of struggle before them was not temporary but long-term; not temporary but regular. This task cannot be accomplished by oral speeches alone, but more importantly by the practical actions of party members and Youth League members, by sincere concern for the lives of the masses, and by the great achievements created by collective strength. Each team has six or seven party members and some Youth League members, and each party member and Youth League member can guarantee to consolidate at least one person and constantly improve their level of ideological awareness. These people have been working together in mutual aid groups for many years, and it is easy to talk about anything. As soon as they discover that someone has a knot in their thinking or someone has difficulties in their life, they immediately try to solve it for him. In addition to party members and Youth League members, the management committee also unites and relies on some non-party activists, and holds an activist meeting every seven or eight days to drive more people forward through them. The management committee also often convenes meetings for some farm members who are performing poorly to solicit their opinions on the farm, inquire about their difficulties, raise issues for them to discuss, and provide guidance to the management committee. At the end of spring plowing and summer weeding, farm member meetings were held to discuss the work of a stage, and the management committee made a summary report to make everyone more aware of the unparalleled superiority of the collective farm, and to make it clearer that doing well is for everyone, and at the same time, it is for oneself. After the wheat was harvested, the grain was distributed according to the prescribed methods, and everyone received much more grain than in the past, so many people's hearts were settled. People's eyes are no longer constantly circling on their own foals, but they see that the collective farm has a "promising start", and everyone is working harder and harder. Some people who used to be more lazy have all made self-criticisms at large and small meetings, shed tears of remorse, and are determined to work hard in the future. Until now, only one farm member—Lin Jingfeng—is still wavering, and the thoughts of others to work in the farm for a long time have been solid. Even Zhou Mingli, who was the least active in the past, has changed. Su Xuejun, who is in his fifties, originally had eight hectares of land and three horses, and mainly relied on exchanging his horses for labor. After joining the farm, he also complained: my horses are being used by you for nothing! Later, he participated in the work of transporting wood for the farm (for building livestock sheds), and saw the enthusiastic help of government staff for the collective farm, and saw the power of the farm's 20 carts transporting wood together. At this moment, he understood: "This is a good direction! Five years from now, my life will definitely be several times better than my life with eight hectares of land and three horses in the past. All the previous ideas were really wrong!" Now he is in charge of feeding the 38 horses of the two teams, and he is very attentive. He said: That horse also has my share, and I must feed them all fat.

Facts are the Most Powerful Education

The benefits of the collective farm are now recognized by everyone in the village. Because of the rational division of labor, the labor force can be well utilized. Old Ren Tou, who is in his sixties, can't do the work in the fields as well as a whole labor force, but he gets the same pay for feeding the horses in the first team as a whole labor force. Chu Fengxiang, who is in his sixties, said: "I can live five more years by establishing a collective farm." There are hundreds of hectares of wasteland in the whole village. Not to mention individuals, even mutual aid groups can only open one or two hectares; the collective farm opened 85 hectares in one year, and harvested more than 700 shi of grain on it. Next year, it plans to open 100 hectares; as long as there are machines, it is not afraid of not being able to open it, and not afraid of not being able to plant it. No peasant can develop animal husbandry on a relatively large scale except for collective farms. The past boundaries and barren lands were eliminated in the spring plowing, and this alone increased 17 hectares of arable land. In the past, each household only planted two or three mu of flax, and there was no way to use a seeder. The collective farm used it. In the mutual aid group, several land-clearing plows were left unused, but this year, after the establishment of the farm, they felt that they were not enough to use. The Central Village has a high terrain and poor soil quality, which can resist waterlogging but not drought, so it mainly grows drought-resistant millet and potatoes; the Northeast Village has a low terrain and good soil quality, which can resist drought but not waterlogging, so it mainly grows wheat, soybeans, and flax. The farm members said: we are no longer afraid of drought and flood!

Collectivization plus mechanization is an invincible force. The Heping Collective Farm still uses horse-drawn mechanical agricultural implements for farming this year, and has already achieved good results. Of course, it will be even better to use tractors in the future. Before they organized mutual aid groups, each labor force could only plant about three hectares of land; after organizing mutual aid groups, especially after starting to use new-style agricultural implements in 1949, each labor force could plant more than four to five hectares of land; this year, the farm averaged seven hectares of land per labor force. Guo Fengyang said: when harvesting wheat, four rocker reapers and one rotary-arm reaper were started together, which was both beautiful and pleasant to hear. Only a rustling sound was heard, and large pieces of wheat were lying on the ground in piles. When harvesting wheat manually, clothes were always soaked with sweat, and a season of wheat harvest would wear them to shreds; now, the wheat is harvested without sweating, and the clothes are still snow-white after a wheat day. The machine has liberated people, and now no one in the farm does not love the machine. In particular, after the implementation of the special responsibility system, there are fewer phenomena of not cherishing public property.

Machines not only improve work efficiency, but also improve people's thinking. In August, the state-owned farm sent two tractors to plow the land for the Heping Collective Farm, and the Keshan Agricultural Experiment Station also sent a "universal machine" to help them threshing. When the tractor was about to arrive in the village, almost all the men, women, and children of the farm turned out, lined up, carried flags, and ran a long way to meet it. After seeing these machines that did not use horses for farming, everyone's collectivist thinking was even more consolidated. They all said: if we had not collectivized, how could we have had such benefits?

"Only Success, No Failure"

"Only success, no failure!" This was the instruction given by the superiors to the local party organization when the Heping Collective Farm was established. Judging from the current situation, ideological education and organizational leadership still need to be strengthened, and production tools and farming techniques still need to be improved; however, basically it can be said that they have succeeded—not only has more grain been harvested, but the thought of collectivization has also taken root. The collective farm is also a collective "school"; not only have the farm members improved their thinking a step in this "school", but the nearby peasants have also been deeply affected. Many farmers near the farm are eager to join the farm. The peasants in the several villages of Heping Village that have not established a farm all want to move to the Central Village. Those who originally bought wood to build houses temporarily did not build them; they planned to find a place in the Central Village to build. The leadership had considered whether to transfer the two small villages with relatively backward work to other nearby administrative villages. They were very unwilling when they heard about it. They said: "We are next to socialism, how can you ask us to leave socialism? We can't let us go out no matter what! We were backward in the past, but we will work hard to catch up in the future, first do a good job in the mutual aid group, and then run the agricultural production cooperative. Whenever we are qualified enough and the conditions are met, if you say that we can enter the farm, we will enter!" Several relatively affluent households with a dozen hectares of land and three or four horses each still held the attitude of "wait and see" in the spring, but now they also want to join the farm.

Guo Fengyang said: in the first year, we didn't have enough experience, and the horse-drawn mechanical agricultural implements were not enough to use; to say we were tired, we were indeed a little tired. But the income is much better than before, and the income of 95% of the farm members is about one-third more than in previous years. Neighboring areas suffered from hail disasters, and we also sent more than 1,000 feet of cloth and a lot of money, and used carts to send vegetables, beans, eggplants, and potatoes to our peasant brothers in the disaster areas. To say it's difficult, it is indeed difficult, much more complicated than mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, and at least twice as busy as when I was the village chief. I have to keep the affairs of the whole farm in mind all the time; sometimes I have to go to each team to see and ask questions before going to sleep, and solve
some problems. But can a communist party member be afraid of difficulties? No. The party has given me strength and the ability to do more and more things. A few years ago, I was still a "big worker", and now I am the chairman of the collective farm, and I have come to Beijing to meet Chairman Mao. I must study hard and go back to run our farm better.

    访和平集体农庄主席郭凤阳
    燕凌
    和平集体农庄主席郭凤阳，带着全农庄集体农民的光荣和快乐，到北京参加了第三届国庆节的盛典。他在北京的一些日子，又正是亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议开会的时候。到处是鲜明的“保卫和平”的标语，到处是响亮的“和平万岁”的呼声。这些都使郭凤阳更加兴奋鼓舞。他对记者说：“和平”真是一个光荣的名字！我们一定要把我们的集体农庄办得更好，保证不辱没这个好名称。
    和平集体农庄是今年四月成立的，地点在黑龙江省克山县的和平村。在一九四八年以前，这个村子并不叫和平村，而叫林井岳屯。对农民说来，这是一个充满了辛酸和愤恨的名字；因为林井岳是个大地主，他霸占了村里的一切，把他的臭名字硬加在村子上面。农民过着怎样的生活，就可想而知了。
    一九四五年八月，苏联红军出兵东北，把东北人民从地狱里救了出来；一九四七年到一九四八年，共产党领导当地农民群众实行土地改革，把地主阶级的统治连根拔起，掀倒在地。农民们在庆祝斗争胜利的大会上，决定把林井岳屯改为和平村。农民们说：“共产党领导我们斗争，就是为了要大家过和平安宁的生活；苏联红军为我们赶走日本鬼子，也是为了和平。保住了和平，我们就能把日子过得越来越好。”今年春天，这个村子的农民们又向前跨进了一步，一百零八户组织了一个集体农庄。集体农庄叫个什么名字呢？大家讨论来讨论去，最后还是决定叫“和平”。
    好收成，好生活
    郭凤阳带着胜利的微笑谈起他们的集体农庄的好收成。他们的农庄共有近七百垧（一垧等于一公顷，合十五市亩）土地（内有新开的荒地八十多垧），大部分种的是小麦（春麦）和大豆，小部分种的是谷子（粟）、高粱、苞米（玉米）和蔬菜。小麦虽然害了疸病，每垧平均还收了三石多（每石小麦约五百斤）；有十多垧丰产地每垧收了六石多（解放前当地小麦每垧不过收两石多一点，一九四八年到一九五一年每垧平均能收二石五斗左右，好的能收四石多）。大豆平均每垧能收八石多
    （每石大豆也是五百斤左右），有十几垧丰产地每垧能收十石多（解放前当地大豆每垧只能收三石多，一九四八年到一九五一年平均每垧约收七石到八石）。谷子（粟）今年平均每垧能收十一石（每石谷子约四百六十斤），最好的每垧能收十五石（解放前当地谷子每垧只能收三、四石，一九四八年到一九五一年平均每垧约收五石多到七石）。今年苞米平均每垧约收十三石（每石苞米约四百四十斤），有八垧多丰产地每垧能收二十多石（解放前当地苞米一般每垧只能收五石左右，一九四八年到一九五一年每垧约收十石多）。所有的作物的产量都比成立集体农庄以前增加了，比解放以前增加得当然更多了。解放以前，当地贫农每个劳动力每年能得到十来石粮食就算不错的了。一九四八年到一九五一年，平均每年每个劳动力能收入十五到二十石粮食；今年成立集体农庄后，劳动得好的每人能收入三十来石粮食；最少的也能收入二十石粮食。庄员张才是一个好“劳动”，他有一匹马，七垧地；去年在互助组里，一年才收入二十四石粮食；今年能收入三十多石粮食。
    现在，农庄里的公有财产已经有一百三十六匹马，二十三辆大车，五套新式马拉机械农具。他们一开始就注意了发展畜牧，今年已经养了一百三十九条牛，一百三十只羊，六十多口猪，由一个畜牧组集中饲养着。加入农庄的人，在几年以前，有八十多户都是三两个人伙用一条破被子。今年，麦子还没收下来，供销合作社就和农庄订了合同，赊给庄员一万二千多尺好布，庄员们家家老早都把过冬的棉衣准备好了，每人都有了一床被子；妇女们做了新裙子，添了许多鲜艳的布衫。几年前，人们常常吃不饱，更不要说上学了。现在全农庄已经有一百一十多个孩子上了小学，六个孩子在县里的中学念书。全农庄订了四十九份报纸，还订了一些刊物。这些报刊有的是农庄管理委员会订的，有的是各生产队订的，有的是各家自己订的。
    集体农庄的物质生活和文化生活天天在上升着。这才是头一年，不过是刚刚开始。郭凤阳说，他们不打算马上建筑漂亮的房子，他们要把最大的力量放在发展生产上。他们首先要添新农具和好肥料。在建筑方面，他们今年已经买到不少木材，打算明年建设一个砖窑，先盖饲养牲畜的地方，然后盖一个公用的会议室。至于庄员们的住宅，将来再说。庄员们都赞成这样做。他们知道，只要生产搞好了，不怕没有好房子住。
    从个体经济经过互助合作的路到达集体经济
    有集体农庄就有幸福，多数人都已经懂得了这个道理。但是，要想把过了几千年个体经济生活的农民带到这个幸福的乐园里来，要想把集体农庄公有制的经济树立起来，那是万万性急不得的。必须使它扎下很深很稳的根基，必须不断地和侵袭它的落后的分散的个体经济思想作斗争。和平集体农庄正是按照这个规律发展起来的。土地改革以后的第一年，一九四八年，全村就有了八个常年互助组。一九四九年，常年互助组增加到十个，其中有三个组有了新式农具。一九五○年，这十个互助组更加扩大和巩固了，每组发展到十五户至十九户。一九五一年，这样的互助组有了十二个，其中五个组有了公有的新式农具，各组都积累了一些公共财产。有两个互助组长当选为全省的农业劳动模范。去年腊月间，村里成立了两个农业生产合作社，互助组也有了新的发展，全村“单干”的农民只剩了三户。这个村的党和青年团的组织基础也比较好；农庄成立前，共有三十九名党员（现在有四十二名）、四十名团员（现有九十多名）。大部分党员参加过县的领导机关举办的训练班，受了比较系统的社会发展前途的教育；今年春天，他们又在全村群众中普遍进行了关于农村发展的两条道路的宣传教育工作。这里靠近国营农场，许多农民亲眼看到过大规模耕作的好处，也便于使用农场的机器进行耕作。在去年腊月间酝酿成立农业生产合作社时，多数群众对于这种进一步走向集体化的组织充满着热情；他们很快就把牲口喂在一起，把做饲料用的草集中起来了。黑龙江省领导方面研究了这个村子的情况，就决定在这个村子试办一个集体农庄（黑龙江省试办了两个集体农庄，另一个叫“新生”集体农庄，在嫩江县），作为引导农民经过互助合作的道路走向集体化的一个活榜样。
    和平村共有五个行政屯（包括八个自然屯），其中三个屯（中心屯、东北屯、团结屯）工作基础最好，集体农庄就是在这三个屯试办的。这个集体农庄的若干重要情况，和松江省桦川县的“星火”集体农庄是不同的。“星火”集体农庄的土地以至农具、房屋，最初都是由国家供给的。“和平”集体农庄的土地、耕畜、农具和其他生产资料，都是从私有转化成集体农庄公有的；成立农庄前，一百零八户中，百分之六十六都过着中农生活。为了照顾农民原来的私有经济的基础，照顾入庄的中农的利益，并稳定庄外个体农民扩大生产的积极性，他们采取了以劳动力为单位平均入股的办法。庄员原有的土地、耕畜、车辆和主要农具、种籽、饲料等，
    一律折价归集体农庄公有。农庄把全体庄员缴公的财产总值用全体庄员（凡年满十六岁的男女劳动者都可参加农庄做正式庄员）人数平均，作为每个庄员应缴的股金数。庄员实际缴公的财产价值超过规定的股金数的，由农庄在两年内退还给本人。股金不足的，在两年内补缴足额。不论多退或少补，都按银行农业贷款的利率得利息或出利息。庄员都留有自用的菜园地；三口人以下的留三亩，四至五口人留四亩，六口人以上的留五亩。庄员对菜园地有使用权，但不能出租、出卖或出让。马匹不论大小都归农庄公有。每一农户只要缴足了股金，可以留
    一个大母牛和一个小牛犊；各户可以随意喂养猪和家禽。
    集体农庄是按庄员在农庄工作的劳动日的多少分配农庄的收入的。在开始种麦的时候，他们是按工作的繁简、轻重和数量定出劳动日。如撒播种籽需要一定的技术，并且背种籽口袋要费力气，种一天记一点二个劳动日；扶犁的记一个整劳动日；扶小拉子（盖土工具）的活轻，记零点七个劳动日。可是，因为用木犁种地技术差别不大，谁也要做整劳动日的活，做不好播种、扶犁工作的人，也争着要播种、扶犁，都不愿作轻活和零碎活。所以，后来又改变了办法：农庄管理委员会按照庄员现有的一般的工作效率，定出各种工作的劳动日定额，用包干制的办法包给各耕作队（全农庄分六个耕作队，每屯两个）；如果不到定额时间就完成了农庄分配给的任务，仍以原来分配的劳动日定额计算。每个队所用的土地、耕畜、车辆、农具都是固定的，没有特殊的需要就不变动。在固定的地段上超过了原定的产量，就给全队以实物奖励。各队分配任务给庄员的时候，暂时不按工作的繁简、轻重计算劳动日，而在每季按每个庄员劳动强弱、技术高低评定一次
    “死分”，做完一段活，再按每个人的实际劳动成绩和劳动态度实行“活评”。到将来各种工作都可能而且必要分等定出合理定额的时候，在群众熟悉了计算劳动日的方法以后，就可以取消这种评分的办法，而直接计算劳动日了。
    农庄的总收入的分配，暂时是这样规定的：除了缴农业税以外，以总收入的百分之三作公积金，购买农具、牲畜和进行公共建筑；以总收入的百分之一作为福利基金，帮助庄内各户老人、残疾者、暂时缺乏劳动力的烈属军属和补助临时托儿所；种籽、饲料按第二年的需要留下，没有规定固定的比例；农庄办公费、公用书报费等，规定不超过总收入的百分之一；修理农具、购买肥料农药的费用和保险费等，按实际需要支出。
    集体主义和个人主义的斗争
    即使有较好的基础，集体农庄也不可能一帆风顺地成立起来。因为互助合作搞得再好，也仍然是建立在个体经济的基础上的；从一个参加互助合作的农民变为集体农民，仍然不是一件简单的事。当集体农庄刚要成立的时候，富农造谣说：集体农庄打了粮食要大家平摊；还说：忙到秋天，只给大家一半粮食，公家要拿走一半。有些老太太听了破坏分子的话，也吵着说：以后吃穿都不得自由了，要吃啥都得吃啥，要穿啥都得穿啥，小鸡下蛋都得归公，自己想买个针头线脑的都不行了。有些家庭里为了参加不参加的问题吵起架来。比较富裕的农民心情不安，有的人为着考虑是不是要加入，通夜睡不着觉。王怀义特别把他在城里读书的儿子王洪生（共产党员）叫回去，问入庄好不好。王洪生说：盼都盼不到呢，怎么还说不好？王怀义想自己留一匹马使用，也被儿子劝阻了。他听儿子一讲解，知道集体农庄前途远大，这才很乐意地加入了。在牵马评价时，许多人思想上特别“起矛盾”；因为过去买马时马价贵，入庄时按当时市价评，比过去要低些，他们就认为“赔钱了”，不想把马牵出来。党员带头毫无顾虑地把马都拉出来让大家评价，并且仔细给有顾虑的人算账、讲前途；最后，大家才都把马折价归公了。中共黑龙江省委派去的工作组依靠和平村的党员团员和村干部，分屯分片开了许多讨论会，把办集体农庄的具体办法给大家讲明白，把破坏分子的谣言一一戳破，解除了许多人的思想顾虑。结果，三个屯的一百二十户，除十户（有人要“等一等瞧，真好了再入”，有人因为劳力弱怕吃亏，有两户是地主成分没有被批准参加）之外，其余的一百零八户都加入了。
    集体主义和个人主义思想的矛盾和斗争，在农庄成立以后继续不断地进行着。郭凤阳说：农庄成立以后，大弯路没有走，小问题可是不断发生。有些人入庄的时候思想问题并没有真正解决，是“随大流”、“赶浪头”卷进来的，入庄后思想斗争并没有停止；特别是原来比较富裕的户，每个时期心里都要“起矛盾”。他们想：虽然财产计价归公后，自己有多余的几百万元，可是将来到底怎么给还没有把握；虽然说两年内还清，还算利息，可是谁知道会不会“变”？有些人怕到秋天打不了多少粮食；劳力弱的害怕即使打了很多粮食，自己也分不到多少；贫困户入庄时短欠股金的，怕秋后补不上股金，还怕补上股金以后吃穿发生问题。总之，有不少人还“不摸底”，因此生产劲头不大；他们抱着“扛大活”的态度，队长叫干啥才干啥，推推动动；有的人不愿干活了，就装作肚痛头痛。种地的时候，有些人只注意自己的小园子地，对农庄的庄稼地不够关心；有少数人还偷偷地把已经归公的粪往自己的园地里送。有些人还想留点“后手”，给农庄缴种籽时留下一些；结果小麦种籽没有凑够，还是向政府贷了一些种籽，才满足了播种的需要。林景风原来有十垧地，四匹马，只有一个劳动力；他过去大半是指望马工换别人的人工，自己不多劳动也不少收粮食；入了农庄，不干活就要记误工，就要少分粮食，他思想一直是动摇的。周明礼的母马归了集体农庄公有以后，下了马崽子，他大哭一场，埋怨他哥哥不该劝他加入农庄。对于公共财产，最初一个时期有些人也不加爱护，发生了“油瓶子倒了也没人扶”的现象。有些人认为：公家的财产，都是我的，也都不是我的；使用的时候都是我的，保管的时候都不是我的。因为照管得不够好，病死了两匹大马和三个马崽子。一春天，鞭梢子就弄坏了几百个。有的妇女下地做活要买个草帽，也向管理委员会借钱；有人有一点点小病，也请管理委员会补助。这些现象的发生，有些是因为制度还不够严密、不够合理，但最根本的原因还是个人主义思想作怪，集体主义的教育不够。问题发生得最多的是团结屯的两个队，原因就在于这个屯的工作基础在三个屯中是比较弱的。郭凤阳说：从这个事实也就可以看出，集体化不能性急，要一步一步走；有些干部盲目地“赶浪头”，想一步跨上去，那是不行的。
    摆在农庄领导干部和当地党的组织面前的最严重的任务是加强思想教育，用集体主义的思想战胜千百年来在个体经济基础上生长着的根深蒂固的个人主义思想。他们没有被上面所说的许多不好的现象吓退，可是也没有轻视这些现象。他们知道：他们面前的斗争任务不是一时的，而是长期的；不是暂时的，而是经常的。这个任务不能只靠口头讲话完成，更重要的是靠党员团员的实际行动，靠对群众生活的真诚关心，靠集体力量创造出来的巨大成就。各队都有六七个党员和一些团员，每个党员团员都能保证巩固住至少一个人，不断提高他们的思想觉悟水平。这些人都是在互助组里一起干了多年的，有什么话都好说。一发现那个人思想上有什么疙瘩、那个人生活上有什么困难，就立即设法给他解决。除了党员团员之外，管理委员会还团结和依靠了一些非党积极分子，每七、八天都要开一次积极分子会，通过他们带动更多的人前进。对一些表现得比较落后的庄员，管理委员会也时常召集他们开会，征求他们对农庄的意见，询问他们有什么困难，提出问题让他们讨论，管理委员加以辅导。在春耕、夏锄结束的时候，都召开了庄员大会，讨论一个阶段的工作，由管理委员会作总结报告，使大家更认识了集体农庄的无比优越性，更认清了干得好是为了大家，同时，也就是为了自己。麦收以后，按规定的办法分了粮食，而且每个人都比过去得到的粮食多得多，许多人的心就安定下来了。人们的眼光不再是经常在自己那马崽子上打圈子，而看到了集体农庄“苗头不小”，大家干起活来越来越起劲了。有些过去比较懒散的人，都在大会小会上做了自我检讨，掉下了悔恨的眼泪，决心以后好好劳动。到现在，只有一个庄员——林景风还是比较动摇的，别的人长期在农庄干下去的思想都扎实了；连过去最不积极的周明礼等人也都转变过来了。五十多岁的苏学君，原来有八垧地、三匹马，主要是靠着马工换人工。加入农庄后，他也发过牢骚：我的马算白给你们使了！后来他参加了为农庄运木材（盖畜舍用）的工作，看到了政府工作人员对集体农庄的热情帮助，看到了农庄二十辆大车一齐运木材的力量。这一下，他明白过来了：“这是个好方向！五年以后，我的生活准比我过去那八垧地三匹马的日子要强几倍。以前的想法真是全都错了！”现在他管喂养两个队的三十八匹马，非常尽心，他说：那匹马也有我的一份，我一定要把一个个都喂肥。
    事实是最有力的教育
    集体农庄的好处，现在是全村的人都承认了。因为实行了合理的分工，劳动力都能很好地发挥出来。六十多岁的老任头，干地里的活顶不上整劳动力，在第一队喂马，得到了整劳动力的报酬。六十多岁的初凤翔说：“成立了集体农庄，我能多活五年。”全村有几百垧荒地，不要说个人，就是互助组也只能开一两垧；集体农庄一年就开了八十五垧，在这上面就收了七百多石粮食，明年还准备开一百垧；只要有机器，就不怕开不动，不怕种不了。比较大规模地发展畜牧，除了集体农庄，农民谁也办不到。过去的地界、荒地头，在春耕中就消灭了，只是这一项就增加了十七垧耕地。种亚麻，过去每家只种两三亩，没法用播种机，集体农庄就用上了。在互助组里，几台开荒犁放着没处用，今年成立了农庄，反而感到不够使了。中心屯地势高，土质不太好，能抗涝不抗旱，就多种耐旱的谷子、土豆；东北屯地势洼，土质好，能抗旱不抗涝，就多种小麦、大豆、亚麻。庄员们说：今后旱涝都不怕了！
    集体化加机械化是无坚不摧的力量。和平集体农庄今年仍是用马拉机械农具耕作，已经有了很好的成绩，以后使用拖拉机，当然就会更好了。他们组织互助组以前，每个劳动力只能种三垧地左右；组织了互助组、特别是一九四九年开始使用新式农具以后，每个劳动力就能种四垧多到五垧多地；今年，农庄平均每个劳动力种了七垧地。郭凤阳说：割麦的时候，四架摇臂收割机，一架转臂收割机一齐开动，又好看又好听，只听哗哗哗一片响声，大片大片的麦子就一堆一堆躺在地上了。人工割麦时，衣服老是浸透了汗，收一季麦就穿得稀碎；现在不出汗就把麦子割下来了，衣服穿一个麦天还是雪白的。机器把人解放了，现在庄员们没有一个不爱护机器的。特别是实行了专责制以后，不爱惜公共财产的现象更少了。
    机器不但提高了工作效率，还提高了人们的思想。八月间，国营农场派了两架拖拉机来给和平集体农庄犁地，克山农业试验场也派了一架“万能机”来帮助他们打场。拖拉机快到村的时候，农庄的男女老少几乎全体出动，排着队，打着旗，跑很远路去迎接。看了这些不用马的机器耕作，大家的集体化思想更加巩固了。都说：要不是集体起来，怎么能有这样的好处？
    “只能成功，不能失败”
    “只能成功，不能失败！”这是和平集体农庄成立时上级给当地党组织的指示。就现在的情况来看，思想教育和组织领导还是需要继续加强的，生产工具和耕作技术还是需要继续改进的；但是，基本上可以说，他们是成功了——不但粮食打得多，集体化的思想也扎了根。集体农庄同时也就是个集体化的“学校”；不但庄员们在这个“学校”中把思想提高了一步，附近的农民们也受了很深刻的影响。农庄附近的许多农户，都热望着加入农庄。和平村没有成立农庄的几个屯的农民，都想往中心屯搬。原来买好了木料要盖房子的，暂时也不盖了；打算在中心屯找下地方盖。有两个工作比较落后的小屯，领导方面曾考虑是不是把它们划归附近别的行政村。他们听到了很不愿意。他们说：“我们挨着社会主义跟前，怎么要我们离开社会主义？高低不能要我们出去！我们过去落后，以后可要努力赶上去，先把互助组搞好，再办农业生产合作社，什么时候程度够了，条件够了，说可以叫我们进农庄了，我们就进！”有几个每户有十来垧地、三四匹马的比较富裕的户，春天还抱着“等一等瞧”的态度，现在也想入庄了。
    郭凤阳说：头一年，没经验，马拉机械农具也不够使；说累，确实是累一些。可是收入比以前好得多了，百分之九十五的庄员的收入比往年都多了三分之一的样子。邻近地区遭了雹灾，我们还送了一千多尺布和许多钱，把菜、豆角、茄子、土豆用大车给灾区农民弟兄们送去。说难，也确实难，比互助组、农业生产合作社都复杂多了，比我当村长时还要忙上至少一倍，时时刻刻都要把全农庄的事放在心上；有时不睡觉要先到各队去看看问问，解决
    一些问题。可是共产党员能怕难吗？不怕。党给了我力量，也给了我能耐，使我越来越能做更多的事。几年以前，我还是个“扛大活”的，现在，我做了集体农庄主席，而且到北京来会见了毛主席。我一定要好好学习，回去把我们的农庄办得更好。
