An Overview of Animal Husbandry in New China

In the past three years, China's animal husbandry has made significant achievements, with livestock numbers increasing year by year. In 1951, compared with 1937, when the War of Resistance Against Japan began, the number of livestock nationwide was 80% for horses, 105% for donkeys, 29% for mules, 116% for cattle, 89% for water buffalo, 82% for sheep, and pigs and chickens had also approached pre-war levels. It is estimated that by the end of 1952, the number of all types of livestock, except for horses and mules, would approach or exceed the levels of 1937. With the recovery and development of animal husbandry production, the lives of people in pastoral areas have also generally improved significantly. For example, in the Hulunbuir League of Inner Mongolia, most of the herders' tents have been replaced with new felt, and they have begun to wear silk and satin and eat wheat flour.

China's vast agricultural and pastoral areas produce large quantities of livestock and fertilizer, large amounts of industrial raw materials, and livestock products needed for export and people's livelihoods every year. Before liberation, due to the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and the plunder and destruction of Japanese imperialism, animal husbandry suffered serious damage. In the early days of the national liberation in 1949, China's animal husbandry showed an unprecedented decline. Comparing 1949 with 1937, horses decreased by 24%, donkeys decreased by 6%, mules decreased by 60%, cattle decreased by 10%, water buffalo decreased by 18%, sheep decreased by 33%, and the losses of pigs and chickens were even greater; moreover, animal diseases were rampant everywhere, and there was a shortage of grass and feed, leading to livestock deaths; the quality and productivity of livestock also generally declined.

In the three years after liberation, the People's Government made various efforts and has rapidly restored China's animal husbandry from a state of decline to pre-war levels.

I. Implementation of the policy of protecting and rewarding livestock breeding. Over the past three years, under the general policy of "protecting livestock and rewarding breeding," local people's governments have implemented important measures such as protecting draught cattle, providing loans for relief, supporting private breeding households, selecting and retaining breeding stock, and holding livestock competitions. In terms of protecting draught cattle, local people's governments have promulgated decrees strictly prohibiting slaughter and have timely corrected the phenomenon of indiscriminate slaughter. For example, in Shanghai, in the winter of 1949, 11% of the cattle slaughtered did not meet the standards; by September 1950, this had dropped to 1.8%. Local people's governments have issued huge amounts of animal husbandry loans and relief funds, which have greatly promoted the protection and rewarding of livestock breeding. For example, in 1951, the animal protection and relief funds issued in the pastoral areas of Suiyuan reached 13 billion yuan, relieving the poor herders from the predicament of having to sell or slaughter large numbers of livestock due to a lack of grass and feed. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also carried out in-kind loans, lending 10,298 head of livestock to households without livestock or with few livestock in 1951. Due to the lack of breeding stock in various places, the People's Government, in addition to organizing local state-owned breeding stations, has also vigorously supported private breeding households to improve their business and eliminate the phenomenon of empty pregnancy in female animals. According to incomplete statistics, there are now more than 20,000 private breeding households throughout the country that have been supported by the People's Government. In addition, various places have also used symposiums and training classes to increase the number and efficiency of livestock breeding. While breeding various livestock in large numbers, local people's governments have also mobilized the masses to select and retain excellent male breeding stock, and have systematically improved the quality of livestock. For example, after the Northeast People's Government announced the reward measures for publicly selected male breeding stock in 1950, more than 25,000 head of excellent breeding stock were selected. Various places have also combined with the patriotic increase production campaign to focus on holding various livestock competitions. The Northeast held four artificial insemination foal competitions and sixty-nine draught cattle competitions, which powerfully educated and encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen to improve livestock breeds.

II. Vigorously prevent and control animal diseases. Before liberation, various serious animal diseases that harmed livestock, such as rinderpest and anthrax, were rampant everywhere, causing a large number of livestock deaths. In the three years after liberation, local people's governments vigorously mobilized the masses, united and transformed traditional Chinese medicine veterinarians, and adopted advanced medical technology to carry out epidemic prevention work, which has achieved remarkable results. At present, rinderpest has been basically eradicated nationwide, and diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax, and blackleg have also been greatly reduced. For example, in 1951, 30% of the counties in the Northwest region had outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in livestock, but after eight months of active prevention and control, they were all eradicated. In 1950, more than 46,000 head of livestock nationwide suffered from anthrax, but in 1951, this had been reduced to more than 5,000 head. In 1950, 11,000 head of livestock in Hebei Province died from anthrax, but in 1951, only 700 head have died to date. In 1949, blackleg was prevalent in 29 counties in Shanxi Province, of which 1,500 head of cattle died in three counties alone; however, by 1951, the epidemic area had been reduced to 20 counties, and the number of cattle deaths had dropped to 540 head. Other animal diseases have also gradually decreased. For example, in the Northeast region, more than 100,000 horses suffered from mange in 1949, but it has now been basically eliminated; in East China, the area where hog cholera and swine erysipelas occurred in 1950 covered 92 counties and cities, but by 1952, the area where hog cholera was prevalent had been reduced to 20 counties, and swine erysipelas had been reduced to 60 counties. Local people's governments vigorously mobilized the masses, adopting quarantine, blockade, disinfection, and carcass destruction, combined with preventive injections. According to incomplete statistics, within three years, a total of 87,010,349 head of poultry and livestock have been vaccinated, 36,900 traditional Chinese medicine veterinarians have been united and transformed, and 1 million farmers and herdsmen have been mobilized to participate in epidemic prevention work.

III. Improve livestock feeding and management. In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, farmers and herdsmen lived on the verge of desperation, and their feeding and management of livestock were extremely crude, resulting in large numbers of livestock deaths and losses. After liberation, in response to the needs of animal husbandry, the People's Government vigorously mobilized farmers and herdsmen to cut grass, dig wells, build sheds and pens, and prevent and control animal pests, improving livestock feeding and management. For example, more than 15,000 sheds and pens have now been built in the pastoral areas of Suiyuan, which can accommodate more than 400,000 sheep. In 1952, 80% of the livestock in Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces had barns. In 1951, Inner Mongolia stored more than 970 million kilograms of winter grass. Farmers in agricultural areas also generally attached importance to storing winter grass. Farmers in Luonan County, Shaanxi Province, also cut more than 800,000 kilograms of grass in the winter of 1951 to protect livestock to survive the winter safely. In animal husbandry areas, opening up water sources and preventing and controlling animal pests are also important tasks for protecting livestock. In the past three years, the pastoral areas of Suiyuan alone have built 3,200 water wells, which have expanded the grassland area and solved the problem of livestock drinking water. In the vast pastoral areas, animal pests are extremely serious. In 1951, 10,510 head of livestock in the Hulunbuir League of Inner Mongolia were eaten by wolves. The People's Government launched a wolf-killing campaign, and after the broad masses of herdsmen vigorously killed wolves, the harm situation has been significantly reduced. In the past three years, Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan have killed a total of more than 53,000 wolves.

In the past three years, the People's Government has paid attention to protecting and improving grasslands in pastoral areas. Ningxia Province organized a grassland management committee, which has achieved remarkable results in leading herdsmen to close beaches and cultivate grass. On the closed grasslands, grass production has greatly increased, and livestock have been well-fed. For example, in 1951, none of the more than 3,000 sheep in Shitouliangzi Village, Er District, Yanchi County, Ningxia, died in winter; the lamb survival rate reached 91.6%. In 1952, Ningxia Province delineated a total of more than 11,000 square li of rotational grazing grassland. In addition, Inner Mongolia's implementation of free grazing and pasture adjustment measures has also achieved significant results in promoting livestock breeding. For example, after Sonid Right Banner in Xilin Gol League implemented free grazing and pasture adjustment in 1951, the livestock breeding rate has increased from 2.7% in the past to 23%.

IV. Getting organized has created unlimited development prospects for animal husbandry. Over the past three years, various forms of cooperation and mutual assistance have been adopted in various places to organize farmers and herdsmen to develop animal husbandry production. For example, the herdsmen of Xin Barag Left Banner in Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia, organized disaster-resistant mutual aid groups, and only 20 of the 580,000 head of livestock died during the winter of 1951. In a grass-cutting season, each labor force in the animal husbandry production mutual aid group of Huheletai, Chen Barag Banner, cut more than 32,000 jin of grass, while other individual households in the area could only cut an average of more than 16,000 jin of grass per labor force. The fifth zuo of Donglian Banner in Xilin Gol League had ten herdsmen who organized a flock-based lambing mutual aid group. In the face of severe wind and snow in 1951, not a single livestock died, which powerfully educated farmers and herdsmen on the superiority of collective management. In addition, provinces such as Ningxia and Xinjiang have systematically led herdsmen to organize grassland management committees to jointly and rationally use grasslands, so that livestock can survive the winter safely and the breeding rate has generally increased.

In the past three years, all major administrative regions and provinces across the country have established animal husbandry and veterinary institutions. At present, there are 114 animal husbandry farms nationwide. In livestock breeding, various places have adopted advanced methods, and the breeding rate has greatly increased. Various places have also purchased a variety of excellent Soviet breeding stock, and are actively working to improve the quality of livestock. The organizational structure for preventing and controlling animal diseases has developed more rapidly, and there are now 1,209 institutions for preventing and controlling various animal diseases nationwide. In the past three years, a total of more than 170 million cubic centimeters of various biological drugs have been produced, which powerfully guarantees the safety of livestock. At present, the number of animal husbandry and veterinary professionals nationwide has grown to nearly 10,000. All of these have laid a good foundation for more rapid development of animal husbandry in the future. What is even more noteworthy is that the awareness of the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen has been raised in the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and their enthusiasm for production has reached an unprecedented high. They have begun to understand the benefits of getting organized to develop animal husbandry. This has created extremely favorable conditions for widely launching the patriotic livestock increase movement and further developing animal husbandry.

    新中国畜牧事业概况
    三年来，我国的畜牧业已有显著的成绩，牲畜逐年增加。一九五一年全国的牲畜数，和抗日战争开始的一九三七年比较，马为百分之八十，驴为百分之一百零五，骡为百分之二十九，黄牛为百分之一百一十六，水牛为百分之八十九，绵羊为百分之八十二，猪、鸡也已接近战前水平。估计到一九五二年年底，除马、骡以外，其他各种牲畜的数量都将接近或超过一九三七年的数量。随着畜牧生产的恢复和发展，牧区人民的生活也已普遍显著地提高。如内蒙呼纳盟，牧民的帐幕大部分都换了新毡子，而且他们已开始穿上绸缎、吃到面粉了。
    我国广大的农区和牧区，每年都出产大量的牲口和肥料、大宗的工业原料、外销和人民生活上所需要的畜产品。解放前，由于国民党反动统治和日本帝国主义的掠夺摧残，使畜牧业遭到严重的破坏。一九四九年全国解放初期，我国畜牧事业呈现着空前未有的衰落现象。如以一九四九年和一九三七年比较，其中马减少了百分之二十四，驴减少了百分之六，骡减少了百分之六十，黄牛减少了百分之十，水牛减少了百分之十八，绵羊减少了百分之三十三，猪和鸡的损失更大；而且到处发生兽疫和缺乏草料、牲畜死亡的现象；牲畜的品质和生产能力也普遍退化。
    解放后的三年当中，人民政府作了各种努力，已使我国的畜牧业从衰落状态迅速恢复到战前水平。
    一、贯彻了保护和奖励繁殖牲畜的政策。三年来各地人民政府在“保护牲畜，奖励繁殖”的总方针下，实施了保护耕牛、贷款救济、扶植民营配种户、选留种畜、以及召开牲畜比赛会等重要措施。在保护耕牛方面，各地人民政府颁布了严禁宰杀的法令，及时纠正了滥宰现象。如上海市在一九四九年冬，屠宰的牛有百分之十一不合标准；到一九五○年九月，已降到百分之一·八。各地人民政府都发放了巨额的畜牧贷款和救济款，对保护和奖励繁殖牲畜起了极大的推动作用。如一九五一年，绥远牧区发放的保畜救济款达一百三十亿元，解除了贫苦牧民因缺乏草料不得已而大量出售或屠宰牲畜的窘困。内蒙古自治区并进行了实物贷放，一九五一年贷给无畜户和少畜户的牲口达一万零二百九十八头。各地种畜缺乏，人民政府除组织地方国营配种站外，更大力地扶植民营配种户改进业务，消除了母畜空怀的现象。据不完全统计，现在全国各地经人民政府扶植起来的民营配种户，已达两万多户。此外，各地还运用召开座谈会、举办训练班，来提高牲畜的配种数量和效率。在大量繁殖各种牲畜中，各地人民政府同时发动群众选留优良种公畜，有计划地改良了牲畜品质。如东北区人民政府在一九五○年公布了民选种公畜奖励办法后，经选定的优良种畜达两万五千多头。各地并结合爱国增产竞赛运动，有重点地举办了各种牲畜比赛会。东北召开了四次人工授精马驹比赛会、六十九次耕畜比赛会，有力地教育和鼓舞了广大农民、牧民改良牲畜品种的热情。
    二、大力防治兽疫。解放前，各种严重为害牲畜的兽疫，如牛瘟、炭疽等等到处流行，造成牲畜很大的死亡。解放后三年来，各地人民政府大力发动群众，团结改造中医兽医，采用先进的医学技术，展开防疫工作后，已获得显著的成绩。目前全国范围内，牛瘟已基本扑灭，口蹄疫、炭疽和气肿疽等疫病也已大为减少。如一九五一年西北区有百分之三十的县份发生牲畜口蹄疫，经过八个月积极防治，便全部扑灭。一九五○年全国发生炭疽病的牲畜有四万六千多头，一九五一年已缩减到五千多头。一九五○年河北省死于炭疽的牲畜一万一千头，一九五一年迄今只死了七百头。一九四九年气肿疽在山西省内流行达二十九个县，其中有三个县就死牛一千五百头；然而到了一九五一年疫区已缩小到二十个县，死牛降到五百四十头。其他兽疫也都逐渐减少。如东北区在一九四九年有十万多匹马发生马癞，现在已经基本消灭；华东区的猪瘟、猪丹毒，在一九五○年发病的区域有九十二个县市，到一九五二年猪瘟流行区域已缩小到二十个县，猪丹毒缩小到六十个县。各地人民政府大力发动群众，采用隔离、封锁、消毒、毁尸，结合预防注射，据不完全统计，三年之内，经过预防注射的禽畜共达八千七百零一万三百四十九头，团结改造中医兽医三万六千九百余人，发动参加防疫工作的农民、牧民共达一百万人。
    三、改善牲畜的饲养管理。过去农民、牧民在国民党反动统治下，生活濒临绝境，对牲畜的饲养管理曾极其粗放，以致造成牲畜的大批死亡和损失。解放后，人民政府针对畜牧业的需要，大力发动农民、牧民及时割草、打井、修建棚圈和防除兽害，改善了牲畜的饲养管理。如绥远牧区现已修建棚圈一万五千多处，可容纳羊四十多万只。辽东、辽西两省一九五二年百分之八十的牲畜都有了厩舍。内蒙地区一九五一年贮存冬草达九亿七千多万公斤。农区农民对贮存冬草也普遍重视，陕西雒南县农民在一九五一年冬天也打草八十多万公斤，保护牲畜安全过冬。畜牧地区，开辟水源和防除兽害，也是保护牲畜的一项重要工作。三年来仅绥远牧区修建水井三千二百眼，使草原面积扩大，同时解决了牲畜饮水困难。在辽阔的牧区中，兽害极为严重，一九五一年内蒙呼纳盟被狼吃掉的牲畜达一万零五百一十头。人民政府发起打狼运动，经广大牧民大力扑杀后，为害情况显著减少。三年来内蒙和绥远共打狼五万三千多头。
    三年来，人民政府在牧区注意了保护草原和改良草原的工作。宁夏省组织草原管理委员会，领导牧民封滩育草有显著成绩。在封闭的草原上，牧草产量大大提高，牲畜得到饱食。如一九五一年，宁夏盐池二区石头梁子村的三千多只羊，冬季无一死亡；羔羊的成活率达到百分之九十一·六。一九五二年宁夏全省划定轮牧草原共约一万一千多平方华里。此外内蒙地区实行自由放牧和调剂牧场的措施，对于促进牲畜繁殖也获得了重大的效果。如锡林郭勒盟苏尼特右旗在一九五一年实行自由放牧调剂牧场后，牲畜增殖率已由过去百分之二·七，提高到百分之二十三。
    四、组织起来，为畜牧事业创造了无限的发展前途，三年来各地已开始采用各种合作互助的形式，组织农民、牧民发展畜牧生产。如内蒙呼纳盟新巴尔虎左翼旗的牧民，组织了抗灾互助小组，在一九五一年过冬期中，五十八万头牲畜只死了二十头。陈巴尔虎旗胡和勒泰的畜牧生产互助组在一个割草期中，每一劳动力割草三万二千多斤，而当地其他单干户，每个劳动力平均只能割草一万六千多斤。锡林郭勒盟东联旗第五佐，有十户牧民组织了拨群接羔互助组，在一九五一年大风雪侵袭中，一头牲畜也没有死，有力地教育了农民、牧民对集体经营的优越性的认识。此外如宁夏、新疆等省，有计划地领导牧民组织草原管理委员会，共同合理使用草原，使牲畜安全过冬，繁殖率也普遍提高。
    三年来，全国各大行政区和省都已设立畜牧兽医机构。目前全国已有畜牧场一百一十四处。繁殖牲畜中，各地接受了先进的方法，繁殖率大为提高。各地并购进苏联多种优良种畜，积极地为改良牲畜的品质而努力。防治兽疫的组织机构发展更为迅速，现在全国已有防治各种兽疫的机构一千二百零九所。三年来，共制成各种生物药品一亿七千多万公撮，有力地保证了牲畜的安全。现在全国各种畜牧兽医专业干部已发展到近一万人。这些都为今后更迅速地发展畜牧事业，打下了良好的基础。更值得注意的是：广大的农民、牧民在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动中，觉悟程度提高，生产情绪空前高涨，他们已开始了解到组织起来发展畜牧业的好处。这已为广泛地开展爱国增畜运动，进一步发展畜牧业创造了极有利的条件。
