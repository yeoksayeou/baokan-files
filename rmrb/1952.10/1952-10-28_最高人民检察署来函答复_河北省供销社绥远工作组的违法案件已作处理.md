    Supreme People's Procuratorate Replies
    Illegal Activities of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Suiyuan Work Group Have Been Dealt With

    Editor: After the People's Daily "Letters from Readers" column published Wang Zhenjiu's letter on July 11th last year, reporting on "The Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Suiyuan Work Group colluding with private merchants in illegal and undisciplined activities, causing serious losses to the people's property," this Procuratorate immediately instructed the Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate to conduct a thorough investigation in coordination with relevant departments. After the Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and other relevant departments organized a joint inspection team to the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative to review materials and conduct on-the-spot investigations, the details of the case and the responsibilities of the relevant personnel have been investigated and dealt with accordingly.

    The facts prove that Wang Zhenjiu's report was correct. In the autumn of 1949, in order to complete the task of promoting the sale of disaster area goods and exchanging them for grain, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative formed the Suiyuan Work Group, headed by Zhou Ying, specifically responsible for this disaster relief task. However, Zhou Ying lost his revolutionary stance, disregarded government decrees, lacked a sense of responsibility for state and people's property, colluded with private merchant Xing Zongzhou, accepted bribes, shielded private merchants from smuggling and evading taxes, and operated the work entrusted by the people from the standpoint of private merchants, resulting in significant losses of 821 million yuan to state property, and leaving extremely bad political influence on the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Chahar and Suiyuan.

    After the "Three-Anti" movement, the Hebei Provincial People's Court, based on the investigation materials of the joint inspection team, sentenced Zhou Ying to ten years imprisonment with a reprieve; the relevant personnel involved in the case were also sentenced according to the degree of their crimes. The bribes and embezzled materials received by the offenders were recovered by the state. In addition, the奸商 (deceitful merchant) Xing Zongzhou was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment and ordered to repay the outstanding amount of 170 million yuan.

### 最高人民检察署来函答复  河北省供销社绥远工作组的违法案件已作处理

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    最高人民检察署来函答复
    河北省供销社绥远工作组的违法案件已作处理
    编辑同志：去年七月十一日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了王振九关于“河北省供销社绥远工作组勾结私商违法犯纪使人民财产受严重损失”的检举信以后，本署即指示河北省人民检察署协同有关部门进行彻查。经河北省人民检察署、中共河北省委纪律检查委员会和中华全国合作社联合总社等有关部门组织联合检查组到河北省供销合作总社进行审核材料、实地调查后，已将案情及有关人员的责任分别调查清楚，并已作了处理。
    事实证明，王振九的检举是对的。河北省供销合作总社在一九四九年秋季，为了完成推销灾区物品、换回粮食的任务，组成了绥远工作组，以周英为组长，专责担任这一救灾任务。但周英丧失革命立场，不顾政府法令，缺乏对国家人民财产的责任感，与同乡私商邢宗周勾结，收受贿赂，包庇私商走私漏税，站在私商立场来经营人民委托的工作，致使国家财产遭受八亿二千一百余万元的重大损失，并给河北省供销合作总社在察哈尔、绥远两地留下了极坏的政治影响。
    “三反”运动后，河北省人民法院已根据联合检查组的调查材料，判周英十年有期徒刑缓期执行；该案有关人员也各按其犯罪程度，分别处刑。各犯所受贿赂及贪污物资，追归国有。另对奸商邢宗周判处有期徒刑十五年，并追还所欠一亿七千余万元款额。
