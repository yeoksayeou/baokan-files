    Notice on Preventing and Eliminating Overwintering Pink Bollworm from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives
    In 1952, pink bollworm infestations occurred widely in cotton-producing areas. Cotton suffered from shedding of buds and flowers, boll rot, and hardened bracts, which not only affected quality and reduced yield but also made it unsuitable for the promotion of superior varieties. According to investigations in the past two years, more than 80% of overwintering pink bollworms are carried into cotton warehouses with seed cotton. Therefore, cotton fields within ten miles of cotton gins or cotton collection stations suffer serious damage.
    Now, cotton picking has begun in various places, and cooperative departments are purchasing large quantities of cotton for warehousing and processing. To improve cotton quality and avoid losses in cotton production, it is essential to eliminate overwintering pink bollworms in all regions. East China already has a considerable foundation for this work and has carried out comprehensive prevention and elimination this year. In other cotton-producing areas, agricultural departments and cooperative departments should closely coordinate and cooperate in key areas to earnestly implement the following tasks:
    1. Each province should select key cotton-producing areas to implement the prevention and elimination of overwintering pink bollworms on a trial basis, with farms, cotton farms, cotton gins, or cotton collection stations as centers, guiding nearby cotton farmers in prevention and elimination. Each center point should pay attention to inspection, timely summarize and absorb prevention and elimination experience, to improve technology. We initially propose the following key areas: Beijing Suburban Area: Wulidian Farm, Shuangqiao Farm, Nanyuan Cotton Gin. North China Area: Fengnan, Langfang, Shijiazhuang, Handan, Nangong, Gaotang, Fengle, Xiaoji, Linfen, Jiexian Cotton Gins; Linqing, Anyang Cotton (Agricultural) Farms. Central South Area: Pingle, Daying, Shashi, Jinshi Cotton Gins; Xujiapeng, Pengze Cotton Farms. Northwest Area: Jingyang Cotton Farm. Northeast Area: Dashiqiao, Xiong Yue, Yishan, Heishan.
    2. Cotton (agricultural) farms, cotton gins, or cotton collection stations should carry out chemical prevention and elimination. 1. Spray or smear a 3-foot wide band of DDT solution containing 5% active ingredient (e.g., one catty of 50% wettable DDT mixed with ten catties of water) on the walls around the flower piles or cotton warehouses, at a height above the flower piles. After the pink bollworms crawl out, they will be chronically poisoned when they pass through the sprayed area, dying in as little as half a month or as long as four to five months. 2. Before applying the pesticide, estimate the maximum amount of cotton to be stored to determine the location of the application, i.e., the application must be above the flower piles. If the height of the flower piles is close to the top of the wall, the pesticide solution must be applied to the ceiling (roof). 3. Apply the pesticide once a month, each time spraying or smearing evenly. Check the mortality rate of the insects half a month after each application. 4. Batch statistics of the time and quantity of seed cotton entering and leaving the warehouse, and finally total the amount of cotton stored, to accumulate the amount of seed cotton that has undergone prevention and elimination. 5. Cotton gins should promptly clear and destroy residual debris. 6. Each factory, station, or place will purchase the required pesticides on its own.
    3. Guide cotton farmers in prevention and treatment. 1. Sun the seed cotton several times. Spread a circle of plant ash around the sunning area to prevent the pink bollworms from crawling out, and then concentrate on eliminating them. 2. After sunning, store the cotton in the warehouse. Pay attention to sweeping around the flower piles and on the surrounding walls. If the number of insects is small, cover the flower piles with cloth sheets, hemp bags, or reed mats, and uncover them every morning and evening to shake off the insects and concentrate on eliminating them. 3. Burn the stored cotton stalks as much as possible before the Qingming Festival.

    关于防除越冬红铃虫的通知
    一九五二年各产棉区普遍发生红铃虫，棉花受害后便落花、落蕾、烂铃、僵瓣，不仅影响品质，降低产量，而且不适于作良种的推广。据最近两年来调查，有百分之八十以上的越冬红铃虫随籽花带入棉仓，因此，靠近轧花厂或收花站周围十里以内棉田的棉花均受严重灾害。
    现在各地已开始收花，合作部门要大量收购棉花进仓加工。为了提高棉花品质和避免棉花生产的损失起见，各地必须把越冬的红铃虫予以消灭。华东对这项工作已有相当基础，今年已进行全面防除，其他各棉区在重点地区，应由农业部门与合作部门密切联系与配合，切实试行下列各项工作：
    一、防除越冬红铃虫各省应选择重点棉区试行，以农场、棉场、轧花厂或收花站为中心，指导附近棉农进行防除。各中心点要注意检查，及时总结、吸取防除经验，以便提高技术。我们初步提出重点区如下：京郊区：五里店农场、双桥农场、南苑轧花厂。华北区：丰南、廊房、石家庄、邯郸、南宫、高唐、丰乐、小冀、临汾、解县轧花厂；临清、安阳棉（农）场。中南区：平乐、大营、沙市、津市轧花厂；徐家棚、彭泽棉场。西北区：泾阳棉场。东北区：大石桥、熊岳、义山、黑山。
    二、棉（农）场、轧花厂或收花站要进行药剂防除。1、在堆花间或棉仓周围的墙壁上，在高出花堆的地位，用含有效成份百分之五的滴滴涕液（例如用百分之五十可湿性滴滴涕一斤加水十斤）喷射或涂抹三尺的宽度，红铃虫爬出后，通过所喷之药，慢性中毒最快半月、最迟四、五个月即死去。2、施药前应估计最高贮花量，再决定施药的位置，即施药必须高出花堆，如花堆的高度与墙壁上端接近时，则药液必须施在顶板（棚顶）上。3、每隔一月施药一次，每次施药（喷射或涂抹）要匀，施药半月后进行检查死虫率。4、分批统计籽棉入仓和出仓的时间与数量，最后总计贮棉量，以便累计经过防除的籽棉数量。5、轧花厂应及时清毁残屑。6、各厂、站、场所用之药剂由各厂、站、场自行筹购。
    三、指导棉农除治。1、将籽花多晒几次，在晒花厂周围用草木灰撒成一个圆圈，防止红铃虫向外爬行，然后集中消灭。2、晒后入仓，在花堆四处及周围墙壁上注意扫除，如数量不多，用布单、麻袋或芦席盖在花堆上，每天早晚揭开，把虫抖下，集中消灭。3、将贮存的棉秸尽量在清明节前烧光。
