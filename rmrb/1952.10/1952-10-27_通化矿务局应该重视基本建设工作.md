    The Tonghua Mining Bureau Should Emphasize Basic Construction Work
    Editor: The leading cadres of the Tonghua Mining Bureau in Northeast China do not pay enough attention to basic construction work, resulting in a chaotic situation in the bureau's basic construction work.

    This year, the Tonghua Mining Bureau has sixty-three projects of various sizes. Earthwork and building construction were scheduled to start in mid-April, but until the first half of April, they were still rushing the design work. In July, the higher-level leadership proposed that production and basic construction departments should be strictly separated, and cadres should be adjusted to improve the organizational structure of basic construction. However, this issue has not been resolved to this day. The Basic Construction Company has not been established, the Basic Construction Section has not provided specific leadership to the construction teams, and the mines have not provided specific assistance to the construction teams. The construction team leaders said: "We are now in a 'no-man's land'." The Basic Construction Section's engineering unit has only one civil engineering technician and one construction team leader, and they do not even know which projects the mining bureau has, so it is impossible to grasp the progress, conduct timely inspections, and carry out acceptance. The design unit lacks on-site investigations during the design process, resulting in frequent phenomena of unsound designs causing waste. The supply of materials is also very untimely. Staff members are not in a stable working mood because the organizational structure has not been adjusted. In terms of manpower allocation, the leadership has not paid attention to transferring stronger cadres to the basic construction department, and some mines have even transferred some sick workers to the basic construction department. In this way, the workers transferred to the basic construction department have ideological concerns, and some people think that they were transferred because they "made mistakes in their work" or "did not work well." The political work of the basic construction department is also very weak. The party's general branch secretary is part-time, there are not enough grass-roots trade union chairmen, and there are no cultural instructors. There are no plans for workers' political education and cultural learning. These situations should be corrected quickly. Zhang Yong

### 通化矿务局应该重视基本建设工作

    通化矿务局应该重视基本建设工作
    编辑同志：东北通化矿务局的领导干部对于基本建设工作重视不足，以致局内的基本建设工作存在混乱现象。
    今年，通化矿务局有大小六十三件工程。土木建筑工程预定在四月中开工，但是直到四月上半月，还在突击设计工作。七月份，上级领导方面提出生产与基本建设部门要严格划分，同时调整干部，健全基本建设的组织机构。但是，一直到现在这一问题仍没有解决。基本建设公司没有成立，基本建设科对工程队没有实行具体领导，各矿对工程队也没有进行具体帮助。工程队长说：“我们现在成了三不管”。基本建设科工程股内只有一名土木建筑技术员，一名工程队长，他们对矿务局里有那些工程都不知道，当然谈不到掌握进度、及时检查、验收了。设计股在设计时缺乏实地调查，因而设计不周造成浪费的现象经常发生。材料供应也很不及时。工作人员们因为组织机构没有调整好，工作情绪也不安定。在人力调配上，领导方面并没有注意把较强的干部调到基本建设部门中去，有些矿竟然将一些病号的工人调到基本建设部门。这样，调到基本建设部门的工人思想上便有顾虑，有人认为是“工作犯了错误”或“干活干的不好”才调来的。基本建设部门的政治工作也很薄弱。党的总支书记是兼职，基层工会主席不够，文化教员也没有，工人的政治教育和文化学习都没计划。这些情况应该很快纠正。　张勇
