    At the Capital Celebration of the Second Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers Entering Korea to Fight
    Opening Speech by Zhang Xiruo, Standing Committee Member of the China Peace Committee
    Comrades, today marks the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers going abroad to fight. People from all walks of life in the capital are holding this meeting today to celebrate this glorious day. First, on behalf of the people of the capital and all the people of China, I would like to pay the highest respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and express our warm congratulations on their great victory.
    In the past two years, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have fought bravely, arduously, and skillfully, inflicting extremely serious blows on the American aggressors and their accomplices and puppet troops. From October 25, 1950, to October 15 this year, the Chinese and Korean people's forces have killed, wounded, and captured more than 660,000 enemy troops, including more than 290,000 American aggressor troops; shot down and damaged more than 7,300 American aircraft; and captured and destroyed many enemy weapons, equipment, and other war materials.
    The great victory achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army together has not only defended the security of the motherland and guaranteed the independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but also disrupted the American aggressors' plan to launch a world war, effectively defended peace in the Far East and the world, and greatly encouraged the people of Asia and the world, strengthening their determination and confidence in victory in defending peace and opposing aggression.
    While achieving brilliant victories in the war on the Korean front, our national movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has also achieved great success. Donations for weapons alone have amounted to funds that can purchase 3,710 fighter planes. This has not only strongly supported the just struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, but also promoted the accelerated progress of various democratic reforms and construction undertakings, such as consolidating national defense, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and developing industrial and agricultural production, as well as political, cultural, and educational endeavors.
    However, the U.S. imperialists have not yet learned the lessons of their defeat. Although they have been forced to conduct Korean armistice negotiations, they fear peace. Therefore, they have been using all kinds of despicable means to delay, obstruct, and sabotage these negotiations, and have inhumanely launched bacteriological warfare in Korea and our Northeast, while also wantonly bombing peaceful cities and innocent people in Korea, and massacring our prisoners of war on a large scale. Recently, after the U.S. negotiating representatives unreasonably announced an indefinite suspension of the negotiations, U.S. aggressor army commander Clark openly rejected the proposal by Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to resume negotiations, plotting to expand the war of aggression against Korea. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and must more actively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, so as to more forcefully support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, in order to strive for a victorious end to the Korean war against aggression and a fair and reasonable peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Our people and the Chinese People's Volunteers will strive with one heart and one mind, and will never give up until this goal is achieved.
    Let us shout:
    Glory to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army!
    Long live the Chinese People's Volunteers!
    Long live the Korean People's Army!
    Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!
    Long live General Kim Il-sung, the great leader of the Korean people!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    在首都庆祝志愿军出国作战两周年大会上
    抗美援朝总会常务委员张奚若的开会词
    今天是中国人民志愿军出国作战两周年纪念。首都各界人民今天在这里举行大会，就是为了庆祝这个光辉的日子。我首先代表首都各界人民和全中国人民，向中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军致崇高的敬礼，并对他们所赢得的伟大胜利表示热烈祝贺。
    两年来中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军一道进行了英勇的、坚苦的、机智的战斗，给了美国侵略者及其帮凶和傀儡军队极其严重的打击。从一九五○年十月二十五日到今年十月十五日，中朝人民部队毙、伤、俘敌军六十六万多人，其中包括美国侵略军二十九万人以上；击伤、击落美国飞机七千三百多架；此外还缴获和摧毁了敌人许多武器装备及其他作战物资。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在一起所取得的伟大胜利不但捍卫了祖国的安全，保障了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立；并且打乱了美国侵略者发动世界大战的计划，有效地保卫了远东及世界的和平，从而大大地鼓舞了亚洲及全世界人民，加强了他们保卫和平、反对侵略的决心和胜利信心。
    与朝鲜前线作战取得辉煌胜利的同时，在我们国内，全国人民的抗美援朝运动也获得了伟大成就，仅捐献武器一项，就捐献了可以购买三千七百一十架战斗机的献款。这不但有力地支持了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的正义斗争，而且推动了巩固国防、土地改革、镇压反革命、发展工农业生产和政治文化教育等各项民主改革和建设事业的加速进行。
    但是，美帝国主义者直到现在并没有接受失败的教训。他们虽然被迫进行了朝鲜停战谈判，但他们又惧怕和平。因此他们一直使用了种种卑鄙的手段来拖延、阻挠和破坏这个谈判，而且灭绝人性地在朝鲜及我国东北等地发动了细菌战，同时狂轰滥炸朝鲜的和平城市及无辜人民，并大规模地屠杀我方战俘。最近在美方谈判代表无理地宣布无限期地中止谈判之后，美国侵略军总司令克拉克更公然拒绝金日成、彭德怀两将军要求恢复谈判的建议，阴谋扩大侵朝战争。因此，我们必须继续加强抗美援朝工作，必须更加积极地开展增产节约运动，以便更有力地支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，来争取朝鲜反侵略战争的胜利结束和朝鲜问题的公平合理的和平解决。我们全国人民和中国人民志愿军必将万众一心地努力奋斗，不达到这个目的，誓不罢休。
    让我们高呼：
    光荣归于中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    朝鲜人民军万岁！
    中朝人民牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
    朝鲜人民的伟大领袖金日成将军万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
