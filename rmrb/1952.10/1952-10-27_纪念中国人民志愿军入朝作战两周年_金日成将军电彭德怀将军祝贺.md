On the occasion of the second anniversary of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army entering Korea to fight, I, on behalf of the entire Korean people and the officers and men of the Korean People's Army, and in my own name, extend warm congratulations and gratitude to you and, through you, to all the officers and men of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, holding high the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homes and our country, came to the Korean battlefield and, together with the Korean People's Army, displayed courage and heroism, severely打击ing the American and British armed invaders, and thwarting the American imperialists' adventurous plan to conquer Korea, the People's Republic of China, and all of Asia.

The Korean people and the Korean People's Army, who have risen up to wage a just Fatherland Liberation War for the freedom, independence, and honor of their motherland, are encouraged by the internationalist assistance of the fraternal Chinese people and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and have further strengthened their confidence in final victory.

I wish you and all the officers and men of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army even more brilliant achievements and victories in the just struggle to eliminate the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese people, the American imperialist aggressors.

Kim Il-sung
Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
October 24, 1952
