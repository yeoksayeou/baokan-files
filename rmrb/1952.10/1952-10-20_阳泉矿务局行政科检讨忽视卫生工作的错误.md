    Yangquan Mining Bureau Administrative Section's Self-Criticism for Neglecting Sanitation Work
    Editor: We believe the reader's criticism, published in the People's Daily's "Letters from Readers" column, regarding our department's neglect of employee sanitation work is correct. We have already conducted an inspection in collaboration with health and medical personnel and the workers. In addition to strengthening existing sanitary facilities, we are also preparing to move the toilets to a more appropriate location. The leadership has already approved the budget for this, and after the relocation, we plan to spread black alum and lime in the toilets to kill flies and insects, and universally install fecal covers. Designated personnel will be assigned to clean them. In addition, we will certainly strengthen sanitary education for canteen staff in the future, and regularly inspect canteen equipment. We will correct any shortcomings found in a timely manner.

    阳泉矿务局行政科检讨忽视卫生工作的错误
    编辑同志：人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载的读者对我处忽视职工卫生工作的批评，我们认为是正确的。我们已经协同卫生医务人员和工人群众进行了检查。除加强现在的卫生设备外，我们并准备把厕所迁移到适当的地方，这笔预算费领导方面已经批准，迁移后准备在厕所里洒铺黑矾石灰，以灭蝇虫，并普遍做了粪盖，设有专人打扫。另外，今后我们一定加强对食堂工作人员的卫生教育，随时检查食堂的设备，发现缺点后及时加以纠正。
