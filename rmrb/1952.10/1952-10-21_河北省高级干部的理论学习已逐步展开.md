The theoretical study of senior cadres in Hebei Province is gradually unfolding under the direct leadership of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. In May, in order to strengthen the theoretical study of senior cadres in a planned way, the Hebei Provincial Committee adopted the method of first organizing the study of senior cadres of provincial-level organs, and then gradually promoting the study of senior cadres in various regions. On May 24, the Provincial Committee issued a notice on organizing the study of senior cadres of provincial-level organs. Under the personal leadership of Lin Tie, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, and nominated by the Provincial Committee, 57 senior cadres (increased to 73 by mid-September) were first organized to study. The organization of the study was divided into three large groups according to the party and mass organizations, government, and military regions, with Lin Tie, Ma Guorui, Yang Xiufeng, Xue Xun, Wang Qicai, and Yu Quanshen serving as the heads and deputy heads of the large groups, respectively. The large groups were further divided into several small groups as regular activity units. They began studying "On Contradiction" in July (the government system started later due to policy inspection). The study method was basically self-study, combined with informal discussions in mutual aid groups, and a forum was held once a week. Senior cadres in the party and mass organizations system have held ten forums during the study of "On Contradiction." To strengthen ideological guidance, a theoretical guidance group of four people was also organized to be responsible for studying the theoretical problems raised in the study.

With the start of the study in provincial-level organs, the study of party history by members of the prefectural and municipal party committees in various regions also began in June. In late June and early August, the Provincial Committee asked members of the prefectural and municipal party committees to report on their individual study plans and study progress. By mid-September, the Provincial Committee had received 36 study plans (three collective ones) and 15 study reports from members of the prefectural and municipal party committees. There were two situations in the study of the prefectural and municipal party committee members: a small number with higher theoretical levels formed advanced groups and formulated their own study plans. Some studied "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party," and others studied "On Contradiction" and "On Practice." The majority studied party history together with ordinary cadres. There were also two situations: one was that the members of the prefectural and municipal party committees formed separate groups and formulated plans according to the plan of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee, studying ahead of the ordinary cadres, and participating in and guiding the study discussions of the ordinary cadres when necessary. This method was very helpful to the study of ordinary cadres, but in some places, the phenomenon of insufficient integration with the study of ordinary cadres occurred; the other was to study together with ordinary cadres without forming separate groups. This method had a great effect on encouraging the enthusiasm of ordinary cadres to study and on timely understanding and solving the study problems of ordinary cadres, but in terms of improving the study of senior cadres themselves, it was not as good as the former. According to the study of the Provincial Committee, the correct method should be to insist on forming separate groups for senior cadres, but also to actively participate in and guide the study of ordinary cadres, especially to give more enlightening reports and answer questions to ordinary cadres.

In the nearly four months of theoretical study, senior cadres in Hebei Province have generally overcome the spontaneous state of being unplanned and unsystematic, and have begun to establish relatively normal study organizations and systems, and thus have gained some gains, which are mainly reflected in: First, on the basis of the "Three-Anti" Movement, through study, they have further realized the importance of studying theory and appreciated the guiding significance of theory for practical work. Many comrades have increased their interest in studying theory and have begun to develop study habits, basically adhering to the study system. They have also explored some experiences in study methods. Second, most members of the prefectural and municipal party committees and a few provincial-level cadres have been able to closely integrate with the party history study of机关 cadres, which not only enriched their own study content, but also strengthened the ideological leadership of the study of ordinary cadres because some comrades gave lectures, answered questions, and participated in the study discussions of ordinary cadres, thus promoting the study of ordinary cadres. When studying "On Contradiction," the Baoding Municipal Committee also studied party history and divided the work to give lectures, which greatly promoted the study of the municipal committee itself and the study of ordinary cadres. Third, policy views and work methods have been improved. After studying, combined with checking their views on current work and policies, provincial-level cadres generally felt that their understanding of the bourgeoisie was clearer and realized that the past deviations in implementing policies towards the bourgeoisie were mainly due to problems with ideological methods, so they failed to specifically analyze the characteristics of the Chinese bourgeoisie. In studying "On Contradiction," they felt that grasping the main contradictions in their work was an important link in improving their work. They are currently studying the main contradictions in their work. After studying party history, many comrades in the prefectural and municipal party committees have a deeper and more specific understanding of Chairman Mao's correct line in various periods. However, in the current study, there are still some problems, mainly: First, ideological guidance is not strong. For example, the Provincial Committee's ideological guidance to the study of the prefectural and municipal party committees is not specific enough, and leaders at all levels lack specific assistance to comrades with lower levels, which affects the study effect. Second, the study organization and system have been established, but they are not solid enough. The contradiction between work and study has not been resolved for some comrades, and study time is still encroached upon. Therefore, strengthening the planning of work and further improving the consciousness of study through study is still a problem that should be solved. Third, the study of most provincial-level comrades is divorced from the study of ordinary 机关 cadres, which affects enriching their own study content and strengthening the leadership of the study of ordinary cadres. Fourth, development is unbalanced. This phenomenon exists both in the implementation of the system and in the gains of the study. Therefore, strengthening the leadership of backward departments and individuals in the study is also a very important task.

    河北省高级干部的理论学习已逐步展开
    河北省高级干部的理论学习，是在中共河北省委直接领导下逐步开展起来的。五月间，河北省委为了有计划地加强高级干部学习，采取了首先组织省级机关高级干部学习，然后逐步推动各地高级干部学习的方法。五月二十四日省委发出了组织省级机关高级干部学习的通知，在省委书记林铁亲自领导下，经省委提名，首先组织了五十七名（到九月中旬已增为七十三名）高级干部进行学习。学习的组织是按党和群众团体、政府、军区系统分为三个大组，由林铁、马国瑞、杨秀峰、薛迅、王奇才、于权伸等分任各大组正副组长。在大组之下又分为若干小组，作为经常活动单位。他们学习“矛盾论”是从七月份开始的（政府系统因作政策检查，开始较晚）。学习方法基本是自学，并结合互助小组漫谈，每周开一次座谈会。党和群众团体系统的高级干部在“矛盾论”学习中，已座谈过十次。为加强思想指导，他们并组织了四个人的理论指导组，负责研究学习中提出的理论问题。
    随着省级机关学习的开始，各地地委、市委委员的党史学习在六月份也开始了。在六月下旬及八月上旬，省委曾要各地委、市委委员报告个人学习计划及学习情况。到九月中旬，省委已收到地委、市委委员的学习计划三十六份（集体的三份），学习报告十五份。地委、市委委员的学习有两种情况：一部分（少数）理论水平较高的编成高级组，自订学习计划。有的学“关于若干历史问题的决议”，有的学“矛盾论”、
    “实践论”。另一部分（多数）和一般干部一同学习党史。这也有两种情况，一种是地委、市委委员单另编组，根据省委宣传部的计划自订计划，学在一般干部的前面，必要时参加和指导一般干部的学习讨论会。这种方法对一般干部的学习帮助较大，但有的地方也发生了和一般干部学习结合不够的现象；另一种是和一般干部一块学习，不另编组。这种方法对鼓励一般干部学习的积极性和及时了解和解决
    一般干部的学习问题有很大的作用，但就提高高级干部本身学习来说，不如前一种。根据省委的研究，正确的方法应当是坚持高级干部单独编组，但又要积极参加和指导一般干部的学习，特别是多向一般干部作启发报告、解答问题。
    河北省高级干部在将近四个月的理论学习过程中，一般已克服了无计划无制度的自流状态，开始建立起比较正常的学习组织和制度，因而有了一定的收获，这主要表现在：一、在“三反”运动的基础上，经过学习，更加认识了学习理论的重要，体会了理论对实际工作的指导意义。不少同志提高了学习理论的兴趣，开始养成了学习习惯，基本上坚持了学习制度。在学习方法上也摸索到一些经验。二、大部分地委、市委委员和少数省级干部，都能和机关干部的党史学习密切结合，这不但使自己的学习内容更加充实，而且因为有的同志给一般干部讲课、解答问题，参加一般干部的学习讨论会，从而加强了对一般干部的学习的思想领导，推动了一般干部的学习。保定市委在学习“矛盾论”时兼学党史，分工讲课，对市委本身学习和一般干部学习都起了很大的推动作用。三、政策观点和工作方法已有提高。省级干部经过学习，结合检查自己对当前的工作和政策的观点，大家普遍感到对资产阶级的认识更加明确了，体会到过去在执行对资产阶级的政策中发生某些偏向，主要是思想方法有毛病，因而未能具体地分析中国资产阶级的特性。在学习“矛盾论”中，感到抓工作中的主要矛盾是提高工作的重要环节。目前他们正在研究自己工作中的主要矛盾。各地委、市委委员学习党史后，很多同志对毛主席各时期的正确路线领会得更加深刻具体了。但是，在当前学习中，也还存在着一些问题，主要是：一、思想指导不强。如省委对各地委、市委的学习，思想指导不够具体，各级领导对水平较低的同志缺乏具体帮助，以致影响了学习效果。二、学习组织和制度是建立起来了，但还不够巩固。部分同志工作和学习的矛盾尚未解决，学习时间仍有被侵占的现象。所以加强工作计划性，通过学习进一步提高学习自觉性还是一个应当解决的问题。三、省级大部分同志的学习和一般机关干部的学习脱节，对丰富自己的学习内容和加强对一般干部学习的领导都有影响。四、发展不平衡。无论在执行制度和学习收获方面都有这种现象。因此，加强对学习落后部门和个人的领导，也是很重要的工作。
