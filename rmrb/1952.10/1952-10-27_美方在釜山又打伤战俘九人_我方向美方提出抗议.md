Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 26th. The U.S. side injured nine more of our captured personnel in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp on the 23rd. According to the U.S. authorities: the cause of this atrocity, like the series of massacre incidents recently created by the U.S. side on Geoje Island, is related to the prisoners of war protesting the U.S. side's arbitrary seizure of prisoners of war under the pretext of "relocating" the camp. Our captured personnel were thus subjected to the barbarous suppression of the U.S. military.

Suffering heavy casualties on the battlefield for months, the U.S. side is now clamoring that it does not have enough manpower. Their massive seizure of people in prisoner-of-war camps is clearly aimed at using our captured personnel as cannon fodder for their conspiracy to continue and expand the war of aggression. Prisoners of war who resolutely refuse to participate in the U.S. war of aggression are sent to undisclosed places to be executed or tortured. According to fragmentary news reports from the U.S. side alone, similar incidents have recently occurred many times on Geoje Island and the Korean Peninsula. This shows that behind the U.S. side's consistent implementation of news blockade, a large-scale conspiracy to forcibly use prisoners of war as cannon fodder is actually being intensified in all U.S. prisoner-of-war camps.

The prisoners of war in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp have always been forcibly called by the U.S. side as "preferring death to returning home." In April of this year, the U.S. side forcibly "relocated" a large number of prisoners of war they declared as "refusing repatriation" from Geoje Island to Busan and other prisoner-of-war camps on the Korean Peninsula. However, these prisoners of war who were forcibly called "refusing repatriation" have been arbitrarily massacred because they opposed forced detention and resolutely demanded repatriation. This once again exposes the U.S. side's wild lies about the so-called "preferring death to returning home" of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. It is ridiculous that while the U.S. side continues to carry out war crimes in prisoner-of-war camps that are even more barbaric than the Nazis, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson shamelessly talked about maintaining the UN Charter at the UN General Assembly. This is the word and deed of the U.S. authorities.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 25th. On October 23rd, the U.S. side injured nine of our captured personnel in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp. General Nam Il, chief representative of our delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations, protested to the other side about this, pointing out that the other side must bear full responsibility for every war crime of maltreatment and massacre of prisoners of war.

    美方在釜山又打伤战俘九人
    我方向美方提出抗议
    【新华社开城二十六日电】美方二十三日在釜山战俘营内又打伤我方被俘人员九名。据美方当局透露：发生这次暴行的原因，与美方最近在巨济岛制造的一连串屠杀事件一样，与战俘抗议美方以“迁移”营场为名恣意抓走战俘有关，我方这些被俘人员因此遭到了美军的野蛮镇压。
    在战场上连月遭受了惨重伤亡的美方，最近正大喊人力不够。他们在战俘营内大肆抓人，显然是在使我方被俘人员充当他们阴谋继续和扩大进行侵略战争的炮灰。坚决拒不参加美方侵略战争的战俘，则被送到不可告人的地方去处死或受折磨。仅据美方片段的新闻报道，最近在巨济岛和朝鲜大陆已发生了多次同样的事件，这说明在美方一贯施行的新闻封锁后面，实际上是所有美方战俘营都在加紧推行着一个大规模强迫战俘充当炮灰的阴谋。
    釜山战俘营内的战俘向来是被美方强称为“宁死也不愿回家”的。在今年四月间，美方把大批被他们宣布为“拒绝遣返”的战俘，从巨济岛强迫“迁移”到釜山及其他在朝鲜大陆上的战俘营去。但是，这些被强称为“拒绝遣返”的战俘却一直因为反对强迫扣留、坚决要求遣返而被恣意屠杀。这就再一次拆穿了美方散布的所谓朝中战俘“宁死不愿回家”的漫天大谎。滑稽的是正当美方在战俘营中继续进行着比纳粹还野蛮的战争罪行的同时，美国国务卿艾奇逊却在联合国大会上厚着脸皮大谈维护联合国宪章。这就是美国当局的言和行。
    【新华社开城二十五日电】十月二十三日美方在釜山战俘营打伤我方被俘人员九人。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军对此向对方提出抗议，指出对方必须对每一次虐待与屠杀战俘的战争罪行负完全的责任。
