    Yunnan Tin Company Workers Achieve Success Using New Exploration Methods
    Kunming, Yunnan—Exploration workers at the Gejiu Yunnan Tin Company have adopted the Soviet advanced experience of "龟裂" (guīliè) fracturing blasting for drilling, yielding significant results. The average exploration efficiency across the mine has increased by 95%, and explosives consumption has been reduced by 20%.
    The "龟裂" fracturing blasting method involves drilling horizontally. The arrangement and distance of the boreholes follow specific rules. When Yunnan Tin Company workers initially experimented with this advanced experience, they encountered some difficulties. However, with strong support from leadership and joint technical improvements by workers and technicians, the new exploration method has achieved remarkable success. Currently, exploration workers throughout the mine have widely adopted the "龟裂" fracturing blasting method for drilling. They have also strengthened transportation within the pits, balancing exploration progress with transportation capacity.

    云南锡业公司工人采用新法探矿获成绩
    个旧云南锡业公司探矿工人采用苏联先进经验——龟裂爆破法打眼，收到很大成绩。全矿探矿效率平均提高百分之九十五，炸药节约百分之二十。
    龟裂爆破法是采取平面打眼方法。眼的排列和距离都有一定规则。云南锡业公司工人开始试验这种先进经验时，曾遇到一些困难；后经领导方面大力支持，工人和技术人员共同在技术上作了种种改进，新法探矿才取得显著成效。目前全矿探矿工人已普遍采用龟裂爆破法打眼，同时也加强了坑内的运输工作，使探矿的进度和运输能力取得平衡。
