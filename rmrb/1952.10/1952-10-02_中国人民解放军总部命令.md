Order from the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
October 1, 1952, Beijing

To all commanders, combatants, political workers, logistics personnel, and engineering and technical personnel of the Army, Air Force, Navy, and People's Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

We, together with the people of the whole country, warmly celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China!

In the past three years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of our country have achieved tremendous achievements and victories in all aspects of national construction. Except for Taiwan, all of our country's territory has been liberated; our national defense has been increasingly consolidated; the Chinese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has achieved a great victory, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in coordination with the Korean People's Army, have inflicted a great blow on the U.S. imperialist aggressors; the national land reform work has been basically completed; all ethnic groups in the country have achieved unprecedented unity; through the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, a new high tide of increasing production and practicing economy has emerged, and the social outlook has been completely renewed; the national economic recovery and transformation work has been basically completed, the national financial and economic situation has fundamentally improved, the living standards of the people across the country have gradually improved, and cultural construction and ideological transformation movements have made great progress. During the same period, the construction of all branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the movement to popularize technical mastery and cultural learning throughout the army, has also achieved significant results. For this, I would like to extend my warm congratulations and heartfelt thanks to you and to the people of the whole country! However, we must never forget that the U.S. imperialists are still occupying our territory—Taiwan, continuing to delay and sabotage the Korean armistice talks, continuing to carry out inhuman germ warfare, continuing to slaughter prisoners of war, indiscriminately bombing peaceful residents of Korea, and constantly carrying out military provocations against our country, plotting to expand the war of aggression; at the same time, the U.S. imperialists are also actively supporting the revival of Japanese and West German militarist forces, using Japan and West Germany as new military bases for wars of aggression, creating a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, in order to safeguard the security of our country, to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, I order you: constantly raise your vigilance, firmly grasp the weapons in your hands, be familiar with and proficient in your own work, constantly improve your cultural level and military and political knowledge, strengthen physical exercise, strengthen organization and discipline, and develop the excellent style of hard work, endurance, integrity, and simplicity, and strive to liberate Taiwan, consolidate national defense, and ensure the smooth progress of national construction!

Long live the Chinese People's Liberation

    中国人民解放军总部命令
    一九五二年十月一日于北京
    中国人民解放军陆军、空军、海军和人民公安部队的指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员、后勤工作人员、工程技术人员全体同志们！
    我们和全国人民一起，热烈地庆祝中华人民共和国成立的三周年！
    三年来，我国人民在毛主席的领导下，在国家建设的各个方面都获得了巨大的成绩和胜利。我国领土，除台湾外已全部解放；我国国防已日臻巩固；中国人民的抗美援朝斗争已取得了伟大胜利，中国人民志愿军协同朝鲜人民军已给予美帝国主义侵略者以极大的打击；全国的土地改革工作已经基本上完成；全国各民族达到空前的大团结；经过伟大的“三反”和“五反”运动，出现了新的增产节约运动的高潮，社会面貌焕然一新；国家经济恢复和改造工作已基本完成，国家财政经济情况已根本好转，全国人民生活已逐渐改善，文化建设和思想改造运动有极大进步。在这同一期间，中国人民解放军各兵种的建设，普及全军的掌握技术及学习文化的运动，亦有重大成绩。为此，我特向你们和向全国人民致以热烈的祝贺和衷心的感谢！但是，我们一刻也不能忘记，美帝国主义者仍在侵占着我国的领土——台湾，继续拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，继续进行绝灭人性的细菌战，继续屠杀战俘，滥炸朝鲜和平居民，并不断向我国进行军事挑衅，阴谋扩大侵略战争；同时，美帝国主义者又积极扶助日本和西德军国主义势力的复活，利用日本和西德作为新的侵略战争的军事基地，造成对远东及世界和平的严重威胁。因此，为了保卫我国的安全，为了保卫远东及世界和平，我命令你们：时刻地提高警惕，紧紧掌握自己手中的武器，熟悉和精通自己的业务，不断提高文化水平和军事政治知识，加强体质锻炼，加强组织性和纪律性，并发挥艰苦耐劳、廉洁朴素的优良作风，为解放台湾、巩固国防、保障国家建设顺利进行而奋斗！

    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民大团结万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    中国人民胜利的组织者、鼓舞者——中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    总司令  朱德
