    New Zealand Representative Mrs. Smith
    Supplementary Report on Protecting Women and Children's Welfare Issues

    Dear fellow peace fighters:

    We have already heard some reports about the situation of women and children in Asian and Latin American countries.

    We are excited about the tremendous progress in the lives and welfare of women and children in New China. The complete freedom and equality they now enjoy inspire those of us in countries that have not yet achieved these rights.

    We deeply appreciate the suffering of women and children in other Asian countries, especially Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, who are suffering from all the cruel ravages of modern warfare. We are deeply shocked to see evidence of the mass destruction of civilians through saturation bombing, napalm bombs, and bacteriological warfare. We recognize our responsibility to redouble our efforts to deeply imprint the tragedies that are happening in these countries today in the hearts of our people.

    The countries of the South Pacific have no experience of modern warfare on their territories, which has created a false sense of security. It is important that our people recognize that our women and children are gradually being threatened by the erroneous policy adopted by our government in following the US government's opposition to the Asian people, which is extending to the heads of our women and children.

    The possibility of a rearmed Japan, under the control of its old leaders, attacking the South Pacific countries is at least the same as attacking a strong and independent China.

    In addition to this external threat, our government's policy of making the country's economy serve the war is also threatening our social and economic way of life. For many years, New Zealand's social legislation, in particular, has been considered a model for Western countries. For example, New Zealand was the first country to grant women the right to vote, and for many years the infant mortality rate has been one of the lowest in the world. Universal education, child allowances, and health services have long been part of our social system. But even if it has not completely stopped, our progress is slowing down today; on the other hand, we see China implementing various progressive legislations relating to women and children.

    As military spending increases, some educational expenses are reduced accordingly. We can further anticipate that as the economic situation worsens due to rearmament, social services will further shrink. In fact, the "Wall Street Journal" is already complaining that too much of New Zealand's income is used for social services.

    Although women can participate in many occupations, their status is generally lower than that of men. They are paid much less than men for doing the same work, and women do not have the same obligation as men to serve as jurors. The concept that marriage is not only a woman's sole career but also her main career is being cultivated painstakingly. It is difficult for a woman to get continued employment after marriage. She must choose between continuing to work or having children, because day care centers, kindergartens, and other facilities are completely inadequate.

    For most women with young children, they are economically completely dependent on their husbands. It is this economic foundation that generates all kinds of inequalities and perceptions, which is the general picture of our life today.

    Although Australia does not have the various forms of exploitation of farmers that are common in Asia, we have a special form of exploitation in New Zealand that is specifically targeted at women and children. This method is called "share milking," where the whole family is hired to milk cows in exchange for a portion of the milk as remuneration. Often, the conditions are exploitative for women and children; if a family is to live on a subsistence level, women and children have to work in the milk shed at four o'clock in the morning. This adds to the suffering of the children, who have to get up so early and walk a long way to school, and then return to the milk shed after school in the evening.

    Although New Zealand can feel a certain degree of pride in the economic and social status that the Maori people have obtained, there are some situations that cannot be ignored. The Maori people theoretically enjoy equality, but in fact they still face some discrimination, especially in the issue of housing. Generally speaking, the houses where our Maori people live are very poor. Another example of racial discrimination is the statement often seen in Auckland: "Maoris need not apply." This is a great pain for the women and children of the Maori people.

    The economic and social status of the Australian aborigines is very low. Since the first day of European migration to Australia, the aborigines have been strongly oppressed. This oppression has often manifested itself in open violence and large-scale massacres, often wiping out entire tribes. Today, there are still harsh laws to manage the aborigines. They do not have the right to vote or claim social insurance. Namatjira, one of Australia's most talented painters, suffers from severe racial discrimination. The education of aboriginal children is almost entirely dependent on missionaries in the areas where the aborigines live. Employment opportunities are extremely narrow and mainly limited to servants and agricultural laborers. The percentage of people suffering from lung disease, especially among women and children, is very high.

    On the Pacific islands, such as the Cook Islands, the Solomon Islands, and other small islands, the living standards of women and children are very low. Except for the larger cities, education and medical treatment are entirely handled by missionaries. Most islands do not have secondary or technical education facilities. Many boys and girls have to go elsewhere to find jobs when they are a little older.

    We have said before that the South Pacific countries have not suffered the ravages of war until today. However, a kind of insidious war from the United States is directly threatening our children. That is the war against their moral character, transforming children's views and attitudes towards life into barbaric or distorted ones through movies, comic books, and serial radio programs. The comic books they read are entirely devoted to depicting savagery and brutality, and overemphasize pornography. These comic books have a strong tendency towards racial prejudice and cultivate a sense of white superiority. It habituates children's minds to wars of conquest and undermines their moral character, thus inevitably leading to the atrocities currently committed in some Asian countries. Many films produced by American film studios promote war, violence, and cruelty. Through songs and radio dramas, the degradation of women is also particularly obvious.

    Defending women and children is defending the future of mankind. In the past two world wars, large-scale bombing, extermination camps, and many other acts of terror have been seen. Since World War II, more children may have suffered than during the war. For our children, we demand a better situation for our children than we had. We want them to grow into creative, thoughtful, and cooperative people, living in a world where human development equals unexplored resources, where they can work together in harmony, treat the people of other countries as brothers, and share the fruits of their labor. We, the advancing women of the world, demand a world that can ensure peace.

    Because one thing is certain. Women do not want to raise children to adulthood only to be conscripted and sent to die on foreign battlefields. Women around the world demand peace. They need peace, and as long as they work together, they can and will win peace. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 新西兰代表史密斯夫人  关于保卫妇女及儿童福利问题的补充报告

专栏：

    新西兰代表史密斯夫人
    关于保卫妇女及儿童福利问题的补充报告各位和平战友们：
    我们已经听过了一些有关亚洲与拉丁美洲各国的妇女和儿童情况的报告。
    我们对新中国妇女和儿童的生活和福利的巨大进步，感到兴奋。她们现在所享受的完全的自由和平等，鼓舞了我们这些还没有取得这些权利的国家的人们。
    我们深深体会到亚洲其他国家，特别是朝鲜、越南和马来亚的妇女和儿童所遭受的苦难，她们正在遭受着现代战争的一切残酷摧残。我们看到用饱和轰炸、凝固汽油弹与细菌战争等等大量毁灭平民的证据，深深感到震惊。我们认识到，我们有责任加倍努力把今天这些国家里正在发生着的全部悲剧深深地印在我们人民的心中。
    南太平洋各国没有过在它们领土上进行现代战争的经验，因而使人们产生了一种虚假的安全感。重要的是，我国人民应该认识到我们的妇女儿童正在逐渐受到一种威胁，这就是由于我们政府所采取的追随美国政府反对亚洲人民的错误政策所招致的威胁正在伸展到我国妇女和儿童们的头上来。
    重新武装起来的、并又在旧领导人物控制之下的日本，用全力来进攻南太平洋各国的可能性，至少和进攻强大、独立的中国是同样的。
    除了这种外部的威胁之外，我们的政府使本国经济为战争服务的政策，也威胁着我们的社会和经济生活方式。多年来，特别是，新西兰的社会立法都被人认为是西方国家的模范。譬如说，新西兰是第一个承认妇女选举权的国家，而且，许多年来婴儿死亡率都一直是全世界上最低的国家之一。普及教育、儿童津贴与卫生事业，长久以来都是我们社会制度的一部分。但是，即使说还没有完全停顿，今天我们的进步也是慢下来了；而在另一方面，我们看到中国正在实行有关妇女和儿童的各种进步立法。
    军事费用增加，某些教育用费就随之减少。我们可以进而预料到，随着重整军备引起的经济情况的恶化，社会服务事业也会进一步收缩。事实上，“华尔街日报”已经在埋怨新西兰的收入中用于服务社会事业的是太多了。
    虽然许多种职业妇女都能参加，她们的地位一般还是低于男子的地位。她们做同样工作所拿的工资还是比男子低得多，而且，妇女没有和男子一样做陪审员的义务。结婚即使不是妇女唯一的事业，也是妇女主要的事业，这个概念被煞费苦心地培养着。一个妇女在结婚以后很难得到继续工作的便利条件。她一定要在继续工作或者是生儿育女二者之间选择一个，因为日间托儿所、幼稚园和其他的设备是全然不敷应用的。
    对于大多数有年幼子女的妇女来说，她们在经济上等于完全依靠她们的丈夫。就是这个经济基础产生了种种不平等现象和看法，那就是我们今日生活的一般面貌。
    虽然澳洲各国并没有具备亚洲所普遍存在的种种剥削农民的形式，我们在新西兰倒有一种特别针对妇女和儿童的剥削方式。这种方式叫做“分奶制”，就是一家老小全被雇去挤牛奶，以分到一部分牛奶作为报酬。往往它的条件就是对于妇女和儿童的剥削，假如一个家庭要过只够糊口的生活、妇女和儿童就不得不在早晨四点钟到牛奶棚里去工作。这增加了儿童的苦难，他们这样早起来以后，还要走很远的路去上学，在黄昏放学以后，又要回到牛奶棚去。
    虽然新西兰对马奥里民族所得到的经济和社会地位还可以感到某种程度的自豪，这里有些情况却是不能忽视的。马奥里民族在理论上可以享受平等，可是事实上却仍然遭到一些歧视，特别是在住房的问题上。一般地讲，我们马奥里人民所住的房屋是很差的。另外一个种族歧视的例子就是在奥克兰常看到这样的声明：“马奥里人毋庸接洽”。这对马奥里民族的妇女和儿童真是一种很大的痛苦。
    澳洲土著人民的经济和社会地位真是非常低的，自欧洲人移殖到澳洲的第一天起，就强烈压迫土人，这种压迫常常表现为公开的暴力行动和大规模的屠杀，时常是整个部落都被消灭掉了。今天还有用严厉的法令来管理土人。他们没有选举权或要求社会保险的权利。那马基利是澳大利亚最有才能的画家之一，他就遭受着苛酷的种族歧视。土著儿童的教育差不多只靠着传教士在土人所住的地方进行。就业之路是极端狭窄的，而且主要地限于作仆役和农业雇工。患肺病者的百分比特别是在妇女和儿童中是非常高的。
    在太平洋诸岛上例如科克群岛、所罗门群岛以及其他小群岛上，妇女和儿童的生活水准真是低得很的。除了比较大一些的城市外，教育和医药治疗是全由传教士办理的，大多数岛屿上都没有中等教育或技术教育的设备。很多男孩子和女孩子到了稍微大一些的时候就不得不到其他地方去找寻职业。
    我们已经在前面说过，南太平洋各国直到今天还没有遭到过战争惨祸。然而，来自美国的某种阴险的战争正直接威胁着我们的儿童。那就是对他们的道德品质作战，通过电影、连环画、和连续性的广播节目把儿童对人生的看法和态度变成是野蛮的或歪曲的。他们所看的连环画完全是以描写野蛮和残暴为内容的，并且过分强调色情。这些连环画有着强烈的种族偏见倾向，并培养着白种人的优越感。它使儿童的思想习惯于征服性的战争，并破坏儿童的道德品质，因此也就必然会引向目前在亚洲一些国家所犯的暴行。美国电影制片厂所出的许多影片，内容都是宣传战争、暴力和残酷的。通过歌曲与无线电广播剧，妇女的堕落也表现得特别明显。
    保卫妇女与儿童就是保卫人类的未来。在过去两次世界大战里，已经见到了大规模的轰炸、杀人营与许多其他的恐怖行为。自二次世界大战以来，遭受苦难的儿童也许比在大战时还多。为了我们的孩子，我们要求给我们的孩子以比我们更好的境遇。我们要他们长成为富有创造能力的、有思想的、善于跟人合作的人，生活在那样一个世界里，在那里，人类开发一向等于没有着手开发的资源，他们可以和谐地在一起工作，把别国的人民当作兄弟，共享他们工作的成果，我们，世界上正在前进的妇女们，要求一个可以确保和平的世界。
    因为有一件事情是肯定的。妇女们不愿孩子抚养到成人后被强征入伍，再让他们在外国的战场上送命了。全世界的妇女要求和平。她们需要和平，同时，只要她们在一起共同努力，就能够而且一定会赢得和平。　（新华社）
