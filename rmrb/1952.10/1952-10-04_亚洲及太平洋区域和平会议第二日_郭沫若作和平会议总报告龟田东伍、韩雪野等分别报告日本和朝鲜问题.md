Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch.
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference continued its sessions on the morning of the 3rd. All representatives listened to the report on the first agenda item of the conference: the general report by Guo Moruo, Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation, entitled "Unite as One, Defend Peace" (full text to be published separately).

    The morning session began at nine o'clock, with James (Australia), Sirindib (Mongolia), Damaratana (Ceylon), Rahimiān (Iran), Dechin Kodo Mai (Burma), and Kuaila (Colombia) serving as executive chairmen. After the meeting began, Executive Chairman James invited Guo Moruo to deliver the general report of the conference. When Guo Moruo stepped onto the podium, all the representatives stood up and applauded to welcome him.

    In his report, Guo Moruo first pointed out the ardent desire for peace of the 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions and the historical significance of this peace conference. Guo Moruo said: The threat of war compels us to urgently mobilize to defend peace. Guo Moruo discussed the situation in the Asian and Pacific regions, emphasizing that the US government, in violation of the wishes of the American people and international agreements, is trying to create international tension and new dangers of war. He said: During the Korean armistice negotiations, peaceful residents in Korea and Northeast China suffered from the harm of germ warfare, Korean peaceful residents continued to suffer crazy bombing, Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war were continuously massacred, and the armistice negotiations suffered savage obstruction. Under the war policy of the US government, foreign military bases continue to expand in eastern and southern Asia, Australia, the Americas, the Near East, the Middle East, North Africa, and Western European countries. Many countries have not gained true national independence, or their independent sovereignty is suffering increasingly serious threats. Guo Moruo focused on the threat posed by the revival of Japanese militarism to peace in the Asian and Pacific regions. After recounting the disasters caused by the Japanese militarist aggressors who launched aggressive wars in China, the Philippines, Burma, Vietnam, and other countries during World War II, he emphasized the current situation in which the US government and the Japanese ruling clique fostered by it are colluding with each other to actively revive Japanese militarism. Guo Moruo said: If this dangerous situation is allowed to develop, the people of the Asian and Pacific regions and the people of the world will suffer new disasters. The people of the Asian and Pacific regions must no longer endure another disaster of Japanese militarist aggression.

    Guo Moruo emphasized: We, the people of the Asian and Pacific regions, have fresh memories of the war disasters we have suffered in the past. We can no longer tolerate the threat of new wars. Everyone must work hard to strive for and defend peace. He described in detail the vigorous development of the peace movement in various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, explaining that the efforts of the people of all countries are consistent. He pointed out: The Soviet Union and China are vigorously engaged in peaceful construction, which shows that they do not want war. The Soviet Union and China have repeatedly expressed their ardent desire for peace. They have proven by their actions that they can coexist peacefully with countries with different social systems. In the long-term comparison of situations, the people of the world have gradually understood the truth and unanimously pursued peace and opposed war. Guo Moruo said: Precious life is a very natural requirement of people. The war mongers are doomed to failure as they call for humans to slaughter each other.

    Guo Moruo then put forward five demands based on the declaration of the preparatory meeting and the proposals initially discussed during the preparatory period, and submitted them to the conference for discussion and adoption. These five demands are:

    1.  Demand a comprehensive solution to the Japanese issue and curb the revival of Japanese militarism. This means concluding a peace treaty with Japan in accordance with the principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter, the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation and agreements; withdrawing all foreign occupation forces stationed in Japan; and supporting the Japanese people in obtaining the rights to independence, peace, and democracy. Under these conditions, it is also agreed that the Japanese people enjoy armed forces for self-defense.

    2.  Demand that necessary steps be taken to achieve a fair and reasonable end to the wars in Korea and elsewhere. This means unconditionally repatriating all prisoners of war and realizing the Korean armistice in accordance with all the terms of the draft Korean Armistice Agreement that has already been agreed upon, in accordance with the Geneva Conventions; stopping all indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities, peaceful construction, and peaceful residents; withdrawing all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, from Korea, and allowing the Korean people to solve their own internal affairs. Conflicts in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Malaya and other places, and unrest in the Near East, the Middle East, and other regions, must also be resolved peacefully in accordance with fair and reasonable principles. No country shall interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, the national independence of these countries should be respected, and their domestic problems should be resolved by themselves.

    3.  Demand that the five major powers, the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and China, conclude a peace pact, implement international disarmament, and prohibit the use of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction; demand that the governments of all countries ratify and earnestly implement the "Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare" signed in Geneva on June 17, 1925; and demand that crimes of abusing and slaughtering prisoners of war and civilians be condemned.

    4.  Demand to guarantee the national independence of all countries. No country shall infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries, such as their territories, territorial waters, and airspace, and shall not establish military bases in other countries; the people of all countries have the freedom to choose the political system and lifestyle they deem satisfactory, and can fully develop fair trade and cultural exchanges between the people of all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully and should respect each other. We demand the immediate cessation of the implementation of any international blockade, embargo, and monopoly policies.

    5.  Demand the prohibition of war-mongering and the propagation of racial hatred, the abolition of discrimination against colored people, and the abolition of all suppression of the peace movement. The people of all countries should have the freedom to participate in the peace movement, and people in all countries who have been persecuted for participating in the peace movement should be guaranteed the right to open appeals and enjoy freedom.

    When Guo Moruo put forward the above requirements one by one, all the representatives applauded enthusiastically.

    Guo Moruo finally said that as long as we unite as one, replace the settlement of disputes by force with the spirit of consultation, replace blockade and monopoly with equality and mutual benefit, and replace national enslavement with mutual friendship, we will have the power to make peace triumph over war. After Guo Moruo finished speaking, all the representatives stood up and applauded enthusiastically for a long time.

    Next, the Korean delegation presented flags to the conference. To the sound of music, the Korean delegation, led by its leader Han Xueye, presented two banners from the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace and the Korean Federation of Literary and Artistic Organizations to the Presidium to congratulate the conference. There was constant applause in the venue during the flag presentation.

    The conference then read out congratulatory telegrams from Park Jung-ae, Vice Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Nenni, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, as well as the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the German Peace Committee. There was enthusiastic applause throughout the venue when the telegrams were read out. The morning session adjourned at 11:10 am.

    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch.
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference continued its sessions on the afternoon of the 3rd. All representatives listened to reports on the second agenda item of the conference - on the Japan issue, and the third agenda item - on the Korean issue.

    The meeting began at 3 pm. Liu Ningyi, Secretary-General of the Peace Conference, first announced that two Australian representatives, ten Burmese representatives, and two Indian observing representatives arrived in Beijing on the 2nd. As of the 3rd, the number of representatives, observing representatives, and specially invited guests attending the conference has reached 412. Liu Ningyi said: The two newly arrived Australian representatives overcame many difficulties to obtain passports and come to Beijing. All the representatives applauded warmly, welcoming the newly arrived representatives.

    The executive chairmen of the afternoon session were: Hikmet (Turkey), Han Xueye (Korea), Ellen Courtney Monteith (New Zealand), Rasuna Said (Indonesia), Mrs. Sanderson (Canada), Manuel Agustín Aguirre (Ecuador).

    After the meeting began, Hikmet, a famous Turkish poet and peace activist, served as the executive chairman. The report on the second agenda item, the report on the Japan issue, was given by Japanese representative Kameda Togo (full text to be published separately, see page 2). Kameda Togo stepped onto the podium amidst enthusiastic applause. In his report, Kameda Togo first described the great significance of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to the Japanese people. He pointed out that the Japanese people allowed Japanese militarism to carry out aggressive wars, which caused unprecedented war disasters to various Asian nations. The Japanese people deeply feel their responsibility. At the same time, the Japanese people also tasted the bitter juice of this consequence, experiencing all kinds of pain in the war and the great disasters of being under foreign occupation after the defeat. However, Japanese militarism, seven years after declaring unconditional surrender, has openly revealed its ferocious posture again under the support of the US occupiers. A small group of warmongers has already used Japan as a base for conducting the Korean War, and attempted to use Japan as a military base to expand the war to China, Southeast Asia, and other regions of Asia and Australia. Kameda Togo emphasized that the Japanese people have begun to awaken and clearly recognize that it is their serious responsibility to unite with the nations of Asia and the Pacific region and work together to eliminate the threat of the revival of Japanese militarism. Kameda Togo spoke about the Japanese people's struggle to oppose war and defend peace amidst warm applause. He said: The movement to defend peace is increasingly penetrating cities, villages, and all classes throughout Japan. This movement is developing forward, focusing on the demands of opposing rearmament, "no interference in Korea," abolishing war treaties, and realizing comprehensive peace. Kameda Togo pointed out that the current path of the Japanese people's struggle is to conclude genuine and comprehensive peace treaties with the countries concerned, to oppose unilateral treaties that create war, and to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism. He emphasized: The content of the comprehensive peace we demand is: the withdrawal of foreign occupation forces from Japan, the prohibition of foreign countries from establishing military bases in Japan, and the guarantee of the integrity of Japanese national sovereignty, recognizing that they have the right to peaceful and democratic development. His words won warm applause from the audience.

    Kameda Togo finally said: We clearly know that to realize our demands, we must go through a difficult struggle process. At the same time, the resolution of this major issue related to the security of the Asian and Pacific region is impossible without the joint efforts of the broad masses of the people in this region. The Japanese people sincerely hope to unite closely with the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific region and work together to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and defend peace in the Asian and Pacific region. After Kameda Togo finished his report, the audience stood up and applauded warmly, fully demonstrating the deep sympathy and support of the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific region for the Japanese people, and their common determination to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism.

    Next, Victor James, the head of the Australian delegation, gave a supplementary report on the Japan issue (full text to be published separately, see page 2). James said that the rise and expansion of Japanese militarism has been the source of deep concern in Australia for many years. After Japan invaded China in 1931 and 1937, Australian dockworkers fought heroically, insisting on refusing to load various strategic materials that the Australian government sold to Japan. After Japan launched the Pacific War of aggression in 1941, Australian seaports were also bombarded by the Japanese navy and air force, and tens of thousands of Australian people became prisoners of the Japanese army and suffered great pain. James pointed out that, after the war, Japan was completely under the rule of the United States, and the roots of Japanese militarism remained untouched. He said that the unilateral "peace treaty with Japan" formulated by the United States is a treaty that betrays the security and future of the Australian people. This treaty immediately aroused the opposition of the vast majority of the Australian people. James emphasized that the governments of the Soviet Union, People's China, India, and Burma, which account for half of the world's population, have not signed this treaty. Although the Australian government signed it, the Australian people did not sign it. James's words won warm applause. James pointed out that because the Australian government has obeyed the US government's war plan in the Pacific, dragging the people of Australia and New Zealand into another war treaty - the US-Australia-New Zealand Security Treaty - our people are faced with two paths: either to become allies of Japanese militarism, or to become its victims. Both will destroy us. The only solution is for our people to fight alongside the people of China, Japan, and other Asian and Pacific countries against the war that is being plotted. James ended his report amidst enthusiastic applause.

    After James's report, representatives of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation presented flowers to the Presidium. There was continuous applause in the venue, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.

    Next, Luis Wheaton, Deputy Secretary-General of the Peace Conference, head of the US delegation, and black peace activist, read out congratulatory telegrams from Matsumoto Jiichiro, the head of the Japanese delegation who was unable to attend the meeting due to the obstruction of the US and Japanese reactionaries, a telegram from Ruth Gage-Colby, Secretary of the "Committee to Encourage American Participation in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference," and congratulatory telegrams from the peace committees of Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, and Guatemala. These congratulatory telegrams all warmly supported the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and wished the conference a complete success. The meeting adjourned temporarily after reading out the congratulatory telegrams.

    The conference resumed at 5:30 pm, with Ellen Courtney Monteith (New Zealand) as the executive chairman. Han Xueye, the head of the Korean delegation, chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, and famous writer, gave the report on the third agenda item: the report on the Korean issue. When Han Xueye stood on the podium, everyone stood up, and there was a long and stormy applause, marking the supreme respect and powerful support of the 1.6 billion people of Asia and the Pacific region for the heroic Korean people.

    The title of Han Xueye's report was: "On the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue on a Reasonable Basis" (full text to be published separately, see page 3). In his report, he detailed the various brutal crimes committed by the US aggressors since launching the war of aggression against Korea, as well as its forced armistice negotiations under the heavy blow of the Korean people and the pressure of world opinion. Han Xueye pointed out that more than a year of armistice negotiations has shown that the US ruling clique does not want an armistice, but wants to expand the war and wants to obtain in the negotiations what it has failed to obtain in the war. Han Xueye exposed the US's tricks of delaying and sabotaging negotiations, and sternly condemned the US's crimes of forcibly detaining and persecuting Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, using bacteriological and chemical weapons, and indiscriminately bombing peaceful Korean cities and residents. He said that if the US ruling clique and generals attempt to continue to sabotage negotiations and expand the war, it will only cause the Korean people to fight more heroically and more resolutely. The Korean people are bound to fight to the end for the peace, independence, and unification of their motherland. Han Xueye emphasized that the Korean people have made great efforts to strive for the peace of their motherland and the world. In order to prevent the various sufferings and misfortunes that have befallen the Korean people today from befalling the people of other countries tomorrow, the Korean War must first be ended on a fair and reasonable basis. Han Xueye then put forward the following specific methods for peacefully resolving the Korean issue: First, demand compliance with international law and international practices, especially the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, and, based on the draft armistice agreement that has been agreed upon by both sides, completely repatriate prisoners of war from both sides and quickly realize the Korean armistice; Second, demand the immediate condemnation and cessation of the bacteriological warfare carried out by the US interventionists in Korea and the destructive bombing of peaceful cities and villages; and punish the organizers of these crimes as war criminals; Third, demand that all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, withdraw from Korea after the Korean armistice agreement is concluded, so that the Korean people can solve their own internal affairs themselves. Han Xueye finally said that he believes that if the above points can be realized, it will not only eliminate the suffering and misfortune that the Korean people are currently suffering, but also pave the way for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and other issues in the Far East; and it will certainly greatly help to maintain the cause of peace in the Asian and Pacific region and the world. When Han Xueye finished his report and walked back to his seat, all the participants once again stood up and applauded for a long time, paying tribute to the peace envoy of the heroic Korean people.

    Next, Diego Montaña Cuéllar, the head of the Colombian delegation, gave a supplementary report on the Korean issue (full text to be published separately, see page 3). He first used the domestic political situation in Colombia since 1946 to illustrate the relationship between Latin American countries and the Korean issue. Montaña Cuéllar pointed out that entrusting a Latin American country with a supplementary report on the Korean issue is the most natural thing, because Latin American countries like Colombia are being used by others as experimental sites to try out a dark system that is being prepared to be imposed on the entire Americas, as a guarantee of a reserve army source in the event of a major war. Almost all South American countries have bilateral military agreements with the United States, which allow the US government to order the signatory countries to send troops to Korea. However, the biggest lesson Colombians have learned from the Korean War is also a very beneficial lesson for other Latin American countries that have had to send troops to Asia in accordance with the military agreements forcibly established by Washington. This lesson is given to us by our unfortunate compatriots; when they returned from the Korean front, some were injured, some were crippled, and they told with disappointment how they had personally witnessed the heroic resistance of the North Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and how they realized that the slogan "fighting for freedom and democracy" shouted in the US-led army was nothing but a lie. To show their high respect to the Peace Conference of the people of the Asian and Pacific region, the Colombian delegation specially brought a statement from the Korean War veterans' group. In this statement, they demanded an end to this absurd and criminal war and demanded the conclusion of a five-power peace pact. The public opinion in our country, the majority not only opposes and hates this military expedition, but also angrily condemns and deeply opposes the use of bacteriological and chemical weapons against undefended peaceful residents, and opposes the physical and mental persecution of prisoners of war. The remaining Latin American countries, because their situation is not as unfavorable as Colombia's, have so far succeeded in preventing the dispatch of expeditionary forces to Korea. But despite this, due to the recently signed bilateral agreements, they may still be drawn into the adventure that has had tragic consequences for Colombia in the future. We must urgently ask them to remain vigilant and redouble their efforts to strive for peace.

    Montaña Cuéllar went on to say that we believe that one of the basic tasks of this conference of the people of the Asian and Pacific region is to take all measures to ensure that the American people can decisively express their opposition to the war, because this war is being waged without considering their wishes and defending their true interests, but is gambling with their destiny. The will of the American people can and must be won over to work for peace. We peace fighters all over the world should enable the American people to remedy the mistakes and relieve the responsibility that the war-mongers have pushed on them.

    Montaña Cuéllar concluded by saying that, distinguished representatives, the Colombian people, who have been engaged in civil war against their own will and forced to participate in international wars, hope that you and the millions of people you represent will immediately and effectively cooperate with them. In such a difficult environment, they are working hard to prevent the continued dispatch of soldiers to Korea. The report of the head of the Colombian delegation received a warm response. Han Xueye, the head of the Korean delegation, warmly embraced this peace envoy of the Colombian people.

    Finally, an extremely moving scene appeared in the venue. Executive Chairman Montésh announced that the Indian delegation presented a gift to the Korean delegation, and everyone stood up and applauded. To the sound of music and enthusiastic applause, the peace representatives of the two countries, led by Han Xueye, the head of the Korean delegation, and Dr. Kitchlew, the head of the Indian delegation, stepped onto the rostrum one after another. The Indian delegation presented a silver plate to the Korean delegation, on which was engraved in Hindi: "The Indian people dedicate this to the brave, peace-loving Korean people." The gifts also included scarves, embroidered clothing and handbags from Kathiawar, lacquered and gilded water bottles and bracelets. The white and yellow scarves entrusted to the Korean delegation to be given to Mrs. Park Jung-ae were embroidered with "Dedicated to the brave peace fighters, a gift from the peace-loving people of India." During the presentation of gifts, the Indian representatives threw flowers at the recipients, expressing blessings. The female representatives of India and the female representatives of Korea embraced each other warmly for a long time. At this time, the continuous applause became more and more enthusiastic. This exciting scene vividly illustrates that the fraternal solidarity between the peoples of all countries fighting for peace, independence and freedom is increasingly strengthened.

    The meeting was then adjourned. Representatives of various countries flocked to the seats of the Korean delegation, warmly shaking hands with the Korean representatives. Luis Wheaton, the head of the US delegation, stepped forward and warmly shook hands and embraced Han Xueye, the head of the Korean delegation.

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第二日
    郭沫若作和平会议总报告
    龟田东伍、韩雪野等分别报告日本和朝鲜问题
    【新华社三日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议三日上午继续开会，全体代表听取了关于大会的第一项议题的报告：中国代表团副团长郭沫若的“团结一心，保卫和平”的总报告（全文另发）。
    上午会议在九时开始，由詹姆斯（澳大利亚）、锡林迪布（蒙古）、达马拉塔纳（锡兰）、拉希米安（伊朗）、德钦哥都迈（缅甸）、库艾拉（哥伦比亚）担任执行主席。会议开始后，执行主席詹姆斯请郭沫若作会议的总报告。当郭沫若步上讲台时，全体代表起立鼓掌欢迎。
    郭沫若在报告中首先指出亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民要求和平的殷切愿望，和这次和平会议的历史意义。郭沫若说：战争的威胁使我们不能不紧急地动员起来保卫和平。郭沫若论述了亚洲及太平洋区域的形势，强调指出美国政府违反美国人民的愿望和国际协定，极力制造国际紧张局势和新的战争危险。他说：在朝鲜停战谈判期间，朝鲜和中国东北的和平居民却蒙受了细菌战的毒害，朝鲜和平居民不断遭受疯狂的轰炸，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员不断被屠杀，停战谈判遭受野蛮的阻挠。在美国政府的战争政策下，外国军事基地不断在亚洲东部和南部、澳洲、美洲、近东、中东、北非及欧洲西部各国扩张，许多国家没有获得真正的民族独立，或者是独立主权在遭受着日益严重的威胁。郭沫若着重指出日本军国主义复活对亚洲及太平洋区域和平的威胁。他在叙述了第二次世界大战时期，日本军国主义侵略者发动侵略战争，在中国、菲律宾、缅甸、越南及其他国家造成的灾难之后，强调指出目前美国政府和在它扶植下的日本统治集团互相勾结积极复活日本军国主义的情形。郭沫若说：如果听任这种危险形势发展下去，亚洲及太平洋区域的人民及全世界人民将会遭受新的灾难。亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民决不能再忍受一次日本军国主义侵略的灾害了。
    郭沫若着重说：我们亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民对过去所受的战争灾难记忆犹新。我们再也不能忍受新战争的威胁了。大家都要努力来争取和保卫和平。他详细叙述了和平运动在亚洲及太平洋区域各国蓬勃发展的情况，说明各国人民的努力方向是一致的。他指出：苏联和中国正大力从事和平建设，这说明他们不要战争。苏联和中国都已再三表示了对于和平的热烈愿望，他们已经用行动证明了他们和其他社会制度不同的国家是能够和平共处的。在长期的形势对比中，世界人民已经逐渐明了了事实真相，一致追求和平反对战争，郭沫若说：宝贵生命是人们很自然的要求。战争野心家以人类自相屠杀相号召，他们是必然要失败的。
    郭沫若接着提出根据筹备会议的宣言和提议在筹备期间经过初步协商过的五项要求，提请大会讨论采纳。这五项要求是：
    一、要求全面解决日本问题，制止日本军国主义的复活。这就是按照联合国宪章、开罗宣言、雅尔塔协定、波茨坦公告和协定所规定的原则，缔结对日和约；撤退驻留日本的一切外国占领军；支持日本人民取得独立、和平、民主的权利，在这样的条件之下，并同意日本人民享有自卫的武装力量。
    二、要求采取必要的步骤，使朝鲜等地的战争得到公平合理的结束。这就是按照朝鲜停战谈判已经取得协议的全部条款，按照日内瓦各项公约，无条件地遣返全部战俘，实现朝鲜停战；停止一切对和平城市、和平建设与和平居民的滥施轰炸；撤退在朝鲜的一切外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军在内，让朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜的内政问题。在越南、寮国、高棉、马来亚等地的冲突，在近东、中东及其他地区的不安，也必须在公平合理的原则之下求得和平解决。任何国家都不得干涉别的国家的内政，这些国家的民族独立应该受到尊重，他们的国内问题应由他们自己解决。
    三、要求美、英、法、苏、中五大国缔结和平公约，实行国际裁军，禁止使用原子武器、细菌武器、化学武器及其他大量杀人武器；要求一切国家的政府批准并切实履行一九二五年六月十七日在日内瓦订立的“关于禁用毒气或类似毒气及细菌方法作战议定书”；并要求谴责虐待与屠杀战俘及平民的罪行。
    四、要求保障各国人民的民族独立，任何国家不得侵犯别国的领土、领海、领空等主权，不得在别国内建立军事基地；各国人民都有自由选择自己认为满意的政治制度和生活方式，并能在平等互利的基础上，充分发展各国人民之间的公平贸易与文化交流。各种社会制度不同的国家是可以和平共处的，是应当相互尊重的。我们要求立即停止任何国际的封锁、禁运与垄断政策的执行。
    五、要求禁止关于战争的叫嚣和种族仇恨的宣传，取消对于有色人种的歧视，取消一切对和平运动的压制。各国人民都应有参加和平运动的自由权，各国因参加和平运动而遭受迫害的人们，应获得公开申诉和享受自由的保证。
    当郭沫若逐项提出上述要求时，全体代表一致热烈鼓掌。
    郭沫若最后说，只要我们团结成一条心，以协商精神代替武力解决，以平等互利代替封锁垄断，以相互友好代替民族奴役，我们就有力量使和平战胜战争。郭沫若讲毕，全体代表一致起立热烈鼓掌经久不息。
    接着朝鲜代表团向大会献旗。在音乐声中，朝鲜代表团由团长韩雪野率领，把朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会和朝鲜文学艺术总同盟祝贺会议的锦旗两面献给主席团。献旗时会场上掌声不断。
    会上接着宣读了朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会副委员长朴正爱，世界工会联合会总书记赛扬和世界和平理事会常务委员会副主席南尼，以及世界民主青年联盟和德国和平委员会的贺电。宣读时全场热烈鼓掌。上午会议至十一时十分休会。
    【新华社三日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议三日下午继续举行会议。全体代表听取了关于大会第二项议题——关于日本问题和第三项议题——关于朝鲜问题的报告。
    会议在下午三时开始。和平会议秘书长刘宁一首先宣布，二日有澳大利亚代表二人、缅甸代表十人、印度列席代表二人到达北京。到三日为止，出席会议的代表、列席代表及特邀来宾已达四百一十二人。刘宁一说：新到的两位澳大利亚代表是克服了很多困难才取得护照来到北京的。全体代表热烈鼓掌，欢迎新到会的代表。
    下午会议的执行主席是：希克梅特（土耳其）、韩雪野（朝鲜）、艾伦·柯特尼·蒙太施（新西兰）、拉苏娜·萨依特（印尼）、桑德逊夫人（加拿大）、曼努爱尔·阿古斯丁·阿吉勒（厄瓜多尔）。
    会议开始后，土耳其著名的诗人与和平战士希克梅特任执行主席。由日本代表龟田东伍作第二项议题的报告：关于日本问题的报告（全文另发，见第二版）。龟田东伍在热烈的欢迎掌声中走上发言台。龟田东伍在报告中首先叙述了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议对于日本人民的重大意义。他指出：日本人民由于允许日本军国主义进行了侵略战争，曾使亚洲各民族遭受到空前的战祸，日本人民深深感觉到自己的责任。同时，日本人民也尝到了这一后果的苦汁，历尽了战争中的各种痛苦和战败后处于外国占领之下的极大灾难。然而，日本军国主义在宣布无条件投降七年以后的今天，在美国占领者的扶植下又公开表露了凶恶的姿态。一小撮战争贩子已经把日本作为进行朝鲜战争的基地，并企图以日本作为军事基地，向中国、东南亚和亚洲、澳洲其他区域扩大战争。龟田东伍强调说：但是，日本人民已经开始觉醒过来，清楚地认识到和亚洲及太平洋区域各民族团结一致共同努力消灭日本军国主义复活的威胁，是自己的严重的责任。龟田东伍在热烈的掌声中谈到了日本人民为反对战争保卫和平而斗争的情形。他说：保卫和平的运动正日益深入到日本全国的城市、农村和一切阶层之中。这个运动正集中在反对重整军备、“不要干涉朝鲜”、废除战争条约、实现全面媾和的要求上面向前发展。龟田东伍指出：日本人民当前斗争的道路就是要与各有关国家订立真正的带有全面性质的和约；反对制造战争的片面和约，并制止日本军国主义的复活。他强调说：我们要求的全面媾和的内容就是：从日本撤退外国占领军，禁止外国在日本设立军事基地，保证日本民族的主权完整，承认他们有和平民主的发展权利。他的话博得了全场的热烈掌声。
    龟田东伍最后说：我们清楚地知道，要实现我们的要求，必须经过艰苦的奋斗过程。同时，这一有关亚洲及太平洋区域安全的重大问题的解决，没有这个区域广大人民的共同努力，是不可能的。日本人民衷心愿望与亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民紧密地团结在一起，共同为反对日本军国主义复活、保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平而努力。龟田东伍报告毕，全场起立报以热烈的鼓掌，充分表明了亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民对日本人民的深切同情和支持，以及他们共同一致地反对复活日本军国主义的决心。
    接着，澳大利亚代表团团长维克多·詹姆斯作了关于日本问题的补充报告（全文另发，见第二版）。詹姆斯说：日本军国主义的兴起和扩张，是澳大利亚多年来深重忧虑的根源。一九三一年和一九三七年日本侵略中国之后，澳大利亚码头工人曾英勇斗争，坚持拒绝装运澳洲政府卖给日本的各种战略物资。一九四一年日本发动了太平洋侵略战争之后，澳大利亚的海港也遭受到日本海空军的轰击，成千成万的澳大利亚人民成为日军俘虏，受尽痛苦。詹姆斯指出：但是在战后，日本完全是在美国的统治之下，日本军国主义的根源还是原封不动。他说：美国所制订的单独“对日和约”，乃是出卖澳大利亚人民的安全与前途的一个条约，这个条约立即引起澳大利亚绝大多数人民的反对。詹姆斯强调指出：占世界人口半数的苏联、人民中国、印度和缅甸的政府没有在这个和约上签字。虽然澳大利亚政府签了字，但是澳大利亚人民并没有签字。詹姆斯的话博得了热烈的掌声。詹姆斯指出：由于澳大利亚政府服从了美国政府在太平洋的战争计划，把澳大利亚和新西兰人民拖进了另外一个战争条约——美、澳、新三国安全条约，使我们的人民面临着两条路：不是成为日本军国主义的同盟者，就是成为它的牺牲品。这两者都会使我们毁灭。唯一的解决办法就是，我们的人民与中国、日本及其他亚洲和太平洋国家的人民并肩为反对正在阴谋策划的战争而斗争。詹姆斯在热烈掌声中结束了他的报告。
    詹姆斯报告后，北京市民主妇女联合会的代表向主席团献花，会场上掌声不断，空气极为热烈。
    接着，和平会议副秘书长、美国代表团团长、黑人和平战士路易士·惠吞宣读了由于美、日反动派的阻挠还未能出席会议的日本代表团团长松本治一郎的贺电，“促使美国人民参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议委员会”秘书鲁莎克的贺电，捷克斯洛伐克、蒙古和危地马拉三国和平委员会的贺电。这些贺电都热烈支持亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，并预祝会议获得圆满的成功。会议在宣读贺电后暂时休会。
    大会在五时三十分复会，由艾伦·柯特尼·蒙太施（新西兰）任执行主席。朝鲜代表团团长、朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会委员长、著名作家韩雪野作了第三项议题的报告：关于朝鲜问题的报告。当韩雪野站上讲坛时，全体起立，响起了经久不息的暴风雨般的掌声，标志着亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民对于英雄的朝鲜人民的崇高的敬意和有力的支持。
    韩雪野报告的题目是：“关于在合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题”（全文另发，见第三版）。他在报告中详细地叙述了美国侵略者发动侵朝战争以来的种种残暴的罪行以及它在朝鲜人民的沉重打击和世界舆论的压力下被迫举行停战谈判的经过。韩雪野指出：一年多的停战谈判表明，美国统治集团并不想停战，而是想扩大战争，并想在谈判中得到战争中所没能得到的东西。韩雪野揭破了美方拖延和破坏谈判的诡计，严正指责了美国强迫扣留并迫害朝中被俘人员、使用细菌和化学武器并滥炸朝鲜和平城市与居民的罪行。他说：如果美国统治集团和将军们企图继续破坏谈判、扩大战争，只能引起朝鲜人民更加英勇、更加坚决地斗争。朝鲜人民是一定要为他们祖国的和平、独立、统一而奋斗到底的。韩雪野强调说：朝鲜人民为了争取祖国与全世界的和平，曾作了莫大的努力。为了使今天落在朝鲜人民头上的各种苦难与不幸，明天不落到其他国家人民的头上去，首先要在公平合理的基础上结束朝鲜战争。韩雪野接着提出和平解决朝鲜问题的具体办法如下：第一、要求遵守国际法与国际惯例，特别是一九四九年日内瓦公约的规定，并根据双方已经达成协议的停战协定草案，全部遣返双方俘虏，迅速实现朝鲜停战；第二、要求立即谴责和制止美国干涉者在朝鲜所进行的细菌战和对和平城市与乡村的破坏性的滥炸；并对于这些罪行的组织者以战争罪犯来惩处；第三、要求一切外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军，在朝鲜停战协定成立后，从朝鲜撤退，让朝鲜人民自己来解决自己的内政问题。韩雪野最后说：我相信，如能够实现以上几点的话，那就不但能够消除今天朝鲜人民所正在遭受的苦难与不幸，并能为和平解决朝鲜问题及远东其他问题开辟道路；进而也一定大大有助于维护亚洲及太平洋区域和全世界和平的事业。当韩雪野报告完毕走回席位时，全体与会者再一次起立，作经久不息的鼓掌，向英雄的朝鲜人民的和平使者致敬。
    接着，哥伦比亚代表团团长迪埃哥·蒙塔尼亚·库艾拉在会上作了关于朝鲜问题的补充报告（全文另发，见第三版）他首先拿一九四六年以来哥伦比亚国内的政治情况来说明拉丁美洲国家与朝鲜问题的关系。蒙塔尼亚·库艾拉指出：把关于朝鲜问题的补充报告付托给一个拉丁美洲的国家是最自然的事，因为像哥伦比亚这样的拉丁美洲国家正被他人用作实验场所，来试行一种准备强加于整个美洲的黑暗制度，作为一旦大战爆发时后备军来源的保证。差不多所有南美洲国家都和美国订有双边军事协定，这些协定允许美国政府有权命令各签约国派遣军队到朝鲜去。但是，哥伦比亚人从朝鲜战争得到的最大教训，对于那些不得不按照华盛顿强制成立的军事协定，向亚洲遣送军队的其他拉丁美洲国家，也是一个非常有益的教训。这个教训是我们那些遭受不幸的同胞给我们的；当他们从朝鲜前线回来的时候，有的受了伤，有的残废了，灰心失望地述说了他们如何亲眼看到北朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军英勇的抵抗，如何认识了在美国指挥下的军队中所喊叫的“为自由、为民主而斗争”的口号不过是一派谎言。为了向亚洲及太平洋区域的人民的和平会议表示崇高的敬意，哥伦比亚代表团特别带来了朝鲜战争退伍军人团体的一个声明书。在这个声明书上，他们要求停止这个荒谬的罪恶战争并且要求缔结五大国和平公约。我们国家的舆论，大多数不但反对和痛恨这个军事远征，而且愤怒地谴责，深切地反对向毫无防御的和平居民使用细菌武器和化学武器，反对对战俘施行肉体上的和精神上的迫害。拉丁美洲其余各国，因为处境不像哥伦比亚那样不利，到目前为止成功地阻止了派遣远征军去朝鲜。但是尽管如此，由于最近签订的双边公约他们在将来仍有可能被卷入给了哥伦比亚以悲惨后果的冒险中去。我们必须迫切地请他们保持警惕，并加倍努力争取和平。
    蒙塔尼亚·库艾拉接着说：我们认为：亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民这次大会的基本任务之一，就是采取一切措施确保美国人民能够决定地表示他们反对战争的意见，因为这个战争在进行时没有考虑到他们的愿望和保卫他们的真正利益，而是拿他们的命运来作赌注。美国人民的意志是能够也必须争取过来为和平而努力的。我们全世界的和平战士应该使美国人民能够补救战争贩子推在他们身上的错误和解脱责任。
    蒙塔尼亚·库艾拉最后说：各位代表，违背了他们自己的意志而从事内战和被迫参加国际战争的哥伦比亚人民，希望你们和你们所代表的千百万人民立刻并有效地和他们合作。他们在这样艰苦的环境下正在努力阻止继续派遣兵士到朝鲜去。哥伦比亚代表团团长的报告得到了热烈的反应。朝鲜代表团团长韩雪野热烈拥抱这位哥伦比亚人民的和平使者。
    最后，会场出现了极动人的场面。执行主席蒙太施宣布印度代表团向朝鲜代表团献礼，全体起立鼓掌。在音乐声和热烈的掌声中，以朝鲜代表团团长韩雪野和印度代表团团长克其鲁博士为首的两国和平代表们先后登上主席台。印度代表团以银盘一个献给朝鲜代表团，盘上用印地文刻着：“印度人民献给英勇的爱好和平的朝鲜人民”。礼物中还有围巾、卡第亚瓦利的刺绣服装和手提包、雕漆嵌金的水瓶和手镯。委托朝鲜代表团转送给朴正爱夫人的交织着白色和黄色的围巾上绣有“献给勇敢的和平战士，印度爱好和平的人民赠。”献礼时，印度代表向受礼者投掷鲜花，表示祝福。印度的女代表和朝鲜的女代表经久地热烈拥抱在一起。这时，不断的掌声愈趋热烈。这个令人激动的场面，生动地说明了为和平、独立与自由而斗争的各国人民间的兄弟团结正日益加强。
    会议至此宣布休会。各国代表纷纷涌向朝鲜代表团的座位前，和朝鲜代表热情地握手，美国代表团团长路易士·惠吞趋前与朝鲜代表团团长韩雪野热烈握手、拥抱。
