Xinhua News Agency report: The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference continued on the morning of the fourth. At the morning session, all the delegates heard reports on the fourth and fifth items on the agenda, namely the report and supplementary report on cultural exchange, and the report and supplementary report on economic exchange.

    The executive chairmen of the morning session were: Louis W. Heston (United States), León Valladares (Nicaragua), Diego Montaña Cuéllar (Colombia), Cheik Mouhammed, El-Achmar (Lebanon and Syria), and Jacob M. Maazus (Israel).

    After the meeting began, Louis W. Heston, head of the U.S. delegation and Black peace fighter, served as executive chairman. Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, head of the Indian delegation, delivered a report on cultural exchange (full text to be published separately, see page 2). In his report, he proposed the main items of the cultural exchange program: (1) Exchange of cultural delegations. (2) Exchange of delegations composed of scientists and engineers. (3) Exchange of delegations composed of farmers, industrial workers, and handicraftsmen. (4) Exchange of sports teams, and if possible, organize regional competitions. (5) Exchange of children's toys between as many countries as possible.
    (6) Exchange of students. (7) Study of foreign languages, and lectureships in major languages should be established in universities where possible.
    (8) Hold art exhibitions, screen films, and perform plays and dances. If possible, dance troupes and music workers' visits should be organized. (9) Translate foreign books. (10) Hold regular meetings of cultural workers. (11) Exchange book catalogs and literary and scientific publications. (12) Celebrate great cultural anniversaries. National institutions should suggest anniversaries that can be celebrated in the Asian and Pacific regions. Kitchlew's report was met with enthusiastic applause.

    Next, Ismael Cosío Villegas, head of the Mexican delegation, gave a supplementary report on cultural exchange (full text to be published separately, see page 2). Cosío's report won enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    After the report on cultural exchange concluded, the conference approved the list of chairmen and vice-chairmen of the seven subcommittees proposed by the presidium for discussing the Japanese issue, the Korean issue, the cultural exchange issue, the development of economic relations issue, the national independence issue, the issue of signing a Five-Power peace treaty, and the issue of promoting and protecting the welfare of women and children, as well as the list of chairmen and vice-chairmen of the drafting committee for the peace conference declaration (the above lists will be published separately). Representatives from various countries participated in the discussions in each subcommittee, and each representative was free to choose to participate in any subcommittee. The meeting was temporarily adjourned at this point.

    The meeting continued at 10:50 a.m., with Diego Montaña Cuéllar, head of the Colombian delegation, serving as executive chairman. Suruoso of Indonesia delivered the report on the fifth item on the agenda—the report on economic exchange (full text to be published separately, see page 2). In his report, Suruoso put forward the following three suggestions on the issue of economic exchange:
    (1) International trade must be developed and artificial barriers eliminated. This effort is inseparable from saving world peace. Therefore, I suggest calling on the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions to rise up and work to eliminate all kinds of artificial barriers and to extensively develop international trade; at the same time, I suggest condemning all war measures such as blockades and embargoes. (2) The Moscow International Economic Conference has pointed out the correct path for people all over the world to improve their living standards by developing international trade. Since the conference, trade relations between countries have begun to recover and develop. The Chinese and Japanese people have signed the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and have made many brilliant efforts to fully implement the trade agreement. This is a major contribution made by the Chinese and Japanese people to the development of international trade in the Asian and Pacific regions. Therefore, we suggest: governments or people of various countries negotiate trade agreements, hold international industrial and agricultural product exhibitions, and exchange representatives to conduct trade contacts in various ways. (3) The U.S. imperialists unreasonably forced the United Nations to pass a proposal to impose an economic blockade on China, which violates the spirit of the United Nations Charter and has not been supported by many Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, I suggest calling on the United Nations to immediately take necessary steps to develop international trade on a global scale on the basis of equality and mutual benefit among all countries, and to remove artificial barriers to international trade that violate the spirit of the United Nations Charter. Suruoso's report was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    Next, Finlay MacKenzie, a Canadian representative, also gave a supplementary report on the fifth item (full text to be published separately, see page 2). He focused on the issue of economic exchange between North and South American countries. When MacKenzie's report ended, the audience continued to applaud.

    Dr. Gyan Chand, Deputy Head of the Indian Delegation and a famous economist, then delivered a supplementary report on economic exchange, entitled "The Economics of Peace" (full text to be published separately, see page 3). The morning session adjourned after Gyan Chand's report.

Xinhua News Agency report: The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference continued its fourth-day session at 3:20 p.m.

    The executive chairmen of the afternoon session were: Matsu Motoji Ichiro’s representative Nakamura Gan'uemon (Japan), Ismael Cosío Villegas (Mexico), Ramón Amaya Amador (Honduras), Stylianos Jacovides (Cyprus), and Jacinto Castellanos Rivas (El Salvador).

    After the meeting began, Nakamura Gan'uemon served as executive chairman. K.P. Vikumtavasan of Ceylon delivered a supplementary report on economic exchange (full text to be published separately). His report received enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    Next, the conference began to hear a report on the sixth item—the issue of national independence, presented by Mrs. Poblete, head of the Chilean delegation, member of the World Peace Council, and Secretary-General of the Chilean Peace Conference. This active female peace fighter from Latin America was welcomed with a standing ovation and enthusiastic applause as soon as she stepped onto the podium.

    Mrs. Poblete's clear-cut, confident, and powerful report was repeatedly interrupted by applause. When she finished her report, all the delegates once again stood up to pay tribute to this enthusiastic peace fighter. (The full text of Mrs. Poblete's report will be published separately.)

    After a short break, the meeting continued at 4:50 p.m., with Ismael Cosío Villegas serving as executive chairman. Hai (Pakistan), Deputy Secretary-General of the Peace Conference, read out congratulatory telegrams from various parties and people's organizations in Vietnam, the India People's Theater Association, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, six literary and art organizations including the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Korean National Committee for Defending Peace, the Polish National Peace Committee, and Stephen S. Tieve, Chairman of the African Federation of Labor Unions. Each congratulatory telegram was warmly welcomed.

    The audience stood up and applauded warmly to welcome Le Dinh Tham, the representative of the Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting for independence and peace.

    Le Dinh Tham, head of the Vietnamese delegation, gave a supplementary report to the conference on the issue of national independence (full text to be published separately).

    Le Dinh Tham's report demonstrated Vietnam's strong and unyielding will to fight for independence and peace, and was enthusiastically supported by all the delegates.

    Next, amidst intertwined music and applause, the Vietnamese delegation and the Lao delegation successively presented flags to the conference. On behalf of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, Le Dinh Tham presented the conference with a red brocade flag embroidered with the golden words "Defend National Independence and World Peace." Also presented to the conference were letters of respect signed by 150 representatives of the Vietnamese People's Army and local troops, and a portion of the more than 3,000 congratulatory letters from all walks of life in Vietnam. When Nohak Phoumsavan, head of the Lao delegation, presented the flag, he said in his speech: We present the flag to the conference on behalf of the Lao people who are fighting. This simple flag symbolizes the Lao people's love for peace, and at the same time expresses the Lao people's willingness to unite with the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions to fight for peace. At this time, the storm-like applause in the venue showed people's love and respect for these two heroic nations who are fighting for peace and national independence.

    Then, Rahimiān, head of the Iranian delegation and former member of parliament, a representative from another Middle Eastern nation bravely fighting for national independence, gave a supplementary report on the issue of national independence (full text to be published separately).

    When Rahimiān finished speaking, all the delegates stood up and applauded enthusiastically.

    General Petit, Vice-Chairman of the French National Peace Council, who was attending the Peace Conference, addressed the conference after the Iranian representative's report. He conveyed the warm respect of the French National Peace Council and millions of French people to the conference. He also expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people, their government, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the peace conference organizers. He said: The great victory of the Chinese people and the complete success of this peace conference will greatly influence the struggle we are waging. One day, we will see peace definitively triumph over war. After tracing the history of the French government's perfidious launch of a brutal war of aggression against Vietnam, General Petit said that he guaranteed that he would do his best to participate in the work of mobilizing the people after returning home, and strive for a swift end to this ugly war. He said: Your important meeting will powerfully promote this result. It will help realize a new era of lasting peace that we all hope for.

    General Petit's speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause from the audience.

    Next, Gopalan, an Indian representative and member of the Indian Parliament, spoke. He emphasized the importance of the issue of national independence for maintaining peace. He said: As long as there is national enslavement and oppression in the world, world peace is not guaranteed. Gopalan went on to talk about how U.S. imperialism is plotting to turn India into their base for aggression in Southeast Asia. However, he said, the Indian people love peace, hate war and war-makers, and they will never allow India to be turned into an imperialist base and transit station. He emphasized: Unity is strength. As long as the people of the Soviet Union, China, India, and other countries in the Asian and Pacific regions unite, they can defeat the warmongers and establish world peace and freedom.

    Gopalan's speech was also frequently welcomed by enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    After Gopalan's speech, the third day of the Peace Conference was adjourned.

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第三日
    听取关于文化、经济交流等报告
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在四日上午继续举行会议。在上午的会议上，全体代表听取了关于会议第四项议题和第五项议题的报告，即关于文化交流的报告和补充报告及关于经济交流的报告和补充报告。
    上午会议的执行主席是：路易士·惠吞（美国），勒恩·瓦拉达勒斯（尼加拉瓜），迪埃哥·蒙塔尼亚·库艾拉（哥伦比亚），契克·穆哈默德、埃尔—阿契玛尔（黎巴嫩和叙利亚），贾可布·马九斯
    （以色列）。
    会议开始后，由美国代表团团长、黑人和平战士路易士·惠吞任执行主席。印度代表团团长赛福丁·克其鲁博士作了关于文化交流的报告（全文另发，见第二版）。他在报告中提出了文化交流纲领的主要项目：（一）互派文化访问团。（二）互派科学家和工程师所组成的访问团。（三）互派农民、产业工人、手工业者所组成的访问团。（四）互派体育队，如果可能的话，可以组织区域竞赛。（五）在尽可能多的国家之间，交换儿童玩具。
    （六）交换留学生。（七）学习外国语文，在可能的情况下，应在各大学设立各种主要语文的讲座。
    （八）举办艺术展览会，放映影片，表演戏剧和舞蹈。如有可能，应当组织舞蹈团和音乐工作者的访问。（九）翻译外文书籍。（十）举办文化工作者的定期会议。（十一）交换图书目录以及文学和科学出版物。（十二）庆祝伟大的文化纪念日。全国性的机构应建议庆祝可以在亚洲和太平洋区域举行的纪念日。克其鲁报告毕，全场热烈鼓掌。
    接着，墨西哥代表团团长伊斯玛尔·科西奥·维里盖斯作了关于文化交流的补充报告（全文另发，见第二版）。科西奥的报告赢得了全场的热烈的掌声。
    关于文化交流的报告结束之后，大会通过了主席团提出的讨论日本问题、朝鲜问题、文化交流问题、发展经济关系问题、民族独立问题、签订五大国和平公约问题及促进和保卫妇女及儿童福利问题的七个小组委员会正副主席的名单，以及和平会议宣言起草委员会的正副主席的名单（上述各项名单另发）。各个小组委员会由各国代表分别参加讨论，每一个代表自由选择参加任一个小组委员会。会议至此暂时休会。
    会议在十时五十分继续进行，由哥伦比亚代表团团长迪埃哥·蒙塔尼亚·库艾拉任执行主席。印尼代表苏鲁梭作了会议的第五项议题的报告——关于经济交流的报告（全文另发，见第二版）。苏鲁梭在报告中，就经济交流问题提出了下列三个建议：
    （一）必须发展国际贸易，消灭人为障碍。这种努力与拯救世界和平是分不开的。因此我建议号召亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民起来，为消除各种人为的障碍，为广泛开展国际贸易而努力；同时建议谴责一切封锁禁运等战争措施。（二）莫斯科国际经济会议已为全世界人民指出从发展国际贸易提高各国人民生活水准的正确道路。会议以来各国之间的贸易关系已经开始趋于恢复与发展。中国人民与日本人民之间签订了中日贸易协议，而且为全部实施贸易协议作了许多辉煌的努力，这是中国人民和日本人民为开展亚洲和太平洋区域国际贸易所作的重大贡献。因此我们建议：各国政府或人民之间，商订贸易协议，举办国际工业农业产品展览，并互派代表进行各种不同方式的贸易接触。（三）美帝国主义在联合国中无理地强迫联合国通过的对中国实行经济封锁的提案，是违反联合国宪章精神的，而且没有得到许多东南亚国家的支持。因此我建议呼吁联合国立即采取必要步骤，以谋在各国平等互利的基础上发展全世界规模的国际贸易，并取消违反联合国宪章精神的对国际贸易的人为障碍。苏鲁梭报告毕，全场响起了热烈的掌声。
    接着，加拿大代表芬雷·马肯辑也就第五项议题，作补充报告（全文另发，见第二版）。他着重谈到了关于南北美洲国家经济交流的问题。马肯辑报告结束时，全场掌声不断。

    高普兰的发言也频频受到听众热烈鼓掌欢迎。
