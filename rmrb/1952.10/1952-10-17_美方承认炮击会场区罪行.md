Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th -- On October 15th, the US Chief Liaison Officer, McCaslin, sent a letter to our Chief Liaison Officer, admitting the US side's act of violating the agreement by shelling the conference area on October 8th. Three days earlier, McCaslin had sent a letter to our side, admitting that US military aircraft violated the agreement by flying over the conference area on October 8th. Both of these provocative incidents occurred on the same day that the US side publicly announced the suspension of the armistice negotiations. Since the resumption of armistice negotiations on October 25th last year, the US side has shelled the conference area four times, and each time has had to admit responsibility for violating the agreement. US aircraft have intruded into the airspace over the conference area eighteen times, of which the US side could not deny and finally admitted to nine times, the US side cunningly denied three times, and the other times the US side's "investigation" is still ongoing, with no outcome. The US side's frequent violation of the agreement and betrayal of promises not only proves that they have no credibility, but also clearly shows that creating incidents is part of their premeditated plan to sabotage the negotiations.

    美方承认炮击会场区罪行
    【新华社开城十六日电】十月十五日，美方首席联络官麦卡塞致函我方首席联络官，承认十月八日美方炮击会场区的破坏协议行为。三天以前，麦卡塞曾致函我方，承认十月八日美方军用飞机违反协议，飞越会场区的行为。这两次挑衅事件都发生在美方公然宣布中断停战谈判的当天，从去年十月二十五日停战谈判复会以来，美方曾先后炮击会场区四次，每次都不得不承认破坏协议的责任。美机曾侵越会场区上空十八次，其中美方无法抵赖终于承认的达九次，美方狡猾抵赖者三次，其他各次美方“调查”至今，迄无下落。美方如此频繁地破坏协议，背弃诺言，不但证明他们毫无信义，而且清楚地说明制造事件是他们预谋的破坏谈判计划中的一个部分。
