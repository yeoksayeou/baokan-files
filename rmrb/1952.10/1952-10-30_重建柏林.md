    Rebuilding Berlin
    Those who visited Berlin shortly after the surrender of Fascist Germany in 1945 could not help but be shocked by the terrible devastation of this German capital. But now, anyone who sees the German working people laboring enthusiastically to rebuild Berlin cannot help but be moved and excited by the rebirth of this nation and their strong will. Rebuilding Berlin from the ruins of war with their own strength is the determination and action of hundreds of thousands of Berlin builders and the entire Democratic Germany today.
    The plan to rebuild Berlin was proposed by the German Socialist Unity Party in November 1951. This plan requires builders to clear nearly ten million cubic meters of rubble and debris from East Berlin within five years, and to rebuild countless new high-rise buildings, flat and wide avenues, and gardens filled with fountains, transforming Berlin to be more beautiful and magnificent than before. This plan was warmly received by the residents of Berlin and the people of the whole country. People contributed to the reconstruction work by donating materials and volunteering their labor.
    On January 2, 1952, the great Berlin reconstruction work officially began. Forty-five thousand people participated in the labor that day, including workers, staff, residents, and government leaders headed by Premier Grotewohl. Since then, the number of volunteers has increased day by day. They participated in volunteer shifts from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM or from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM, according to their own time. In the work of clearing rubble, many people completed more than half or more of their quotas. By July of this year, more than 800,000 Berlin residents and people from all over the country had participated in volunteer labor.
    The main project of rebuilding Berlin this year is the construction of a east-west thoroughfare - Stalin Avenue. In this area, which is about two kilometers long and one kilometer wide, broken walls, ruins and piles of rubble will be cleared, and thirteen brand-new buildings will stand next to the wide boulevards. These buildings, ranging from six or seven stories to twelve or thirteen stories high, have 2,000 well-equipped rooms.
    The construction work on Stalin Avenue is intense and enthusiastic. Every day at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the construction site becomes lively. Batches of workers, residents, office staff, students and people's police come to the construction site from all directions with tools, roll up their sleeves, and work with high spirits to clear rubble and transport debris; some saw wood, others build walls. At this time, the dazzling lights illuminate the construction site brightly, powerful cranes busily swing their long arms to send building materials back and forth, radio broadcasters report important news and the construction achievements of the builders, and sometimes broadcast moving music.
    The builders of Stalin Avenue not only enjoy the pleasure of working for the construction of the motherland in their own work, but also receive the support of the entire Berlin and the broad masses of the German people. More than one million working people in Democratic Germany donate 3% of their annual wages for the reconstruction of Berlin; workers launch competitions to manufacture building materials and reduce costs; farmers put forward guarantees to increase grain production; scientists and engineers contribute their talents and experience; symphony orchestras and choirs often come here to sing the most exciting programs for the builders. On the construction site, one can also see the steel produced by the Riesa Iron and Steel Plant, the cement transported from Dresden, and the wood donated by the Brandenburg farmers.
    Now, the builders have seen the results of their labor, and buildings have appeared on Stalin Avenue. On the eve of May Day this year, the first nine-story building, forty meters high, stood on the south side of Stalin Avenue. Thirty-two households—including workers, technicians, people’s police, doctors, and teachers—have moved into this new home. This building not only has spacious rooms, plenty of sunlight, modern water, electricity, and sanitary facilities, but also soundproof floors, automatic electric water heaters, and a rooftop garden with a panoramic view of Berlin. "Moved from underground to heaven," this is the feeling of the father of the female worker Milita Kamba, a new resident of the high-rise who had lived in a dark basement, after moving into the high-rise. Indeed, for the people of Democratic Germany who lived in air-raid shelters in the early post-war period and struggled all day for their daily food, they cannot help but be excited and joyful to see their lives rising day by day today.
    The new high-rise buildings standing on Stalin Avenue are shining brightly in the sun, attracting the residents of Berlin, symbolizing the vision of Berlin's construction and the future of Democratic Germany. With the efforts of the German working people, democratic Berlin will be built into a beautiful and peaceful city. (Attached picture)

    重建柏林
    在一九四五年法西斯德国投降后不久到过柏林的人们，都不能不为这个德国首都被毁的可怕面貌而触目惊心；但是现在谁要是再见到德国劳动人民为重建柏林而热情劳动的情形，则又不能不为这个民族的新生和他们的坚强意志而感动兴奋。把柏林从战争的废墟上用自己的力量重建起来，这就是今天成千成万柏林建设者和整个民主德国人民的决心和行动。
    重建柏林的计划，是德国统一社会党在一九五一年十一月提出来的。这个计划要求建设者们在五年内清除东柏林的近一千万立方公尺的瓦砾碎砖，并重建起无数新的高楼大厦、平坦宽广的大道和布满着喷泉的花园，把柏林改造得比从前更加美丽，更加宏伟。这个计划得到了柏林居民和全国人民的热烈响应。人们用捐献物资和志愿劳动的方式来为重建工作献出一份力量。
    一九五二年的元月二日，伟大的柏林重建工作正式开始了。四万五千人参加了这一天的劳动，这里边包括工人、职员、居民和以格罗提渥总理为首的政府首长。自此以后，志愿劳动的人数就一天比一天增多起来。他们按照自己的时间，分别参加每天下午从五时到八时，或从八时到十一时的志愿劳动班。在清理瓦砾的工作中，很多人完成了超过他们定额的一半以上或者更多的任务。到今年七月时，参加志愿劳动的柏林居民和各地人民已经有八十万以上了。
    今年重建柏林的主要工程是建造一条横贯东西的大道——斯大林大街。在这一个约长二公里、宽一公里的地区内，断墙残垣和成堆的瓦砾将被清除，十三座崭新的大楼将要在宽广的林荫大道旁耸立起来。这些高达六、七层至十二、三层不等的大楼，拥有二千间设备完善的房间。
    斯大林大街的建设工作是紧张而热烈的。每到下午五点钟，建筑现场上就热闹开了。一批批的工人、居民、机关人员、学生和人民警察带着工具从四面八方来到工地，卷起了衣袖，精神饱满地从事清理瓦砾，搬运碎砖等工作；有的人锯木，有的人砌墙。这时候，耀眼的灯光把工地照得通明，强大的起重机忙碌地摆动着它的长臂，把建筑材料送来送去，无线电广播器报告着重要新闻和建设者们的劳动成就，还有时播送出动人的音乐。
    斯大林大街的建设者们不仅在自己的工作中享受到了为建设祖国而劳动的愉快，并且也得到了整个柏林和广大德国人民的支持。一百多万民主德国劳动人民把自己每年所得工资的百分之三捐献出来作为重建柏林之用；工人们为制造建筑器材和减低成本而展开竞赛；农民们提出了增产粮食的保证；科学家和工程师献出了他们的才能和经验；交响乐队和歌咏团经常来到这里为建设者们演唱最精彩的节目。在工地上，人们还会见到里沙钢铁厂出产的钢材，从德累斯顿运来的水泥和布兰登堡农民捐献的木材。
    现在，建设者已经见到了他们自己的劳动成果，一幢幢的楼房已经在斯大林大街上出现了。今年五一节前夕，在斯大林大街的南面，耸立起了第一座高达四十公尺的九层大厦。三十二家住户——包括工人、技师、人民警察、医生和教员，已搬进了这所新居。这座楼房不但有宽敞的房间，充足的阳光，现代化的水电、卫生设备，而且还有隔音地板、自动电气煮水器和可以眺望柏林全景的屋顶花园。“从地下搬进了天堂”，这就是曾经住过阴暗的地下室的高楼新居户、女工米利塔·卡姆巴的父亲在搬进高楼后的感觉。的确，对于在战后初期曾经生活在防空洞里，曾经整天为每日的粮食而奔走的民主德国人民来说，今天不能不因为看到自己生活的天天上升而兴奋喜悦。
    耸立在斯大林大街上的新高楼，正在阳光下闪发着耀眼的光芒，它吸引着柏林的居民，象征着柏林建设的远景和民主德国的未来。在德国劳动人民的努力下，民主柏林将被建设成为一个美丽的和平的城市。（附图片）
