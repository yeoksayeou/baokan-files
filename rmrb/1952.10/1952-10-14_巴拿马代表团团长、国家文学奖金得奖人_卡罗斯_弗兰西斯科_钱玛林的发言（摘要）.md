We crossed several continents, overcame the obstruction of the American intelligence agencies and the oppression of our own government to come here, so we arrived a little late. But these things did not prevent us from coming here, to be among these enthusiastic peace-loving people. We have come here not to seek benefits for the imperialist robbers, but to share this feeling fraternally with the people of all countries in the world; to share this feeling with those who shed blood in the struggle for peace, especially the resolute Korea, the strong Laos, Vietnam and Malaya, and especially the motherly China, the powerful homeland of Mao Zedong, New China.

Panama is the "White Haired Girl" of Latin America. If you look for Panama on the capitalist map, you will see that, because of that canal, we are neither in Bolivar's South America nor in Morazán's Central America. In fact, we seem to have no place to stand. This is because the American jackals do not want Panama to be a free country, but want Panama to become a "White Haired Girl" in the black hole of capitalist exploitation.

At the same time, when the Americans seized this canal, which was originally dug by the French, they also seized the railway that runs across the isthmus. They seized the water in the river (for example, Panama City must pay the US government when using water originating from a Panamanian river). They seized the airspace, and later the electricity. They seized large tracts of land; maintained the yellow rule of bananas; on the land they seized, jackals lick the rubber sap; this situation persecutes our landless peasants, and also engulfs the agricultural laborers of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Jamaica.

The US government is not satisfied with plundering these riches; it has virtually occupied our roads, transportation, and underground mineral resources.

Officials in the US State Department prepared the conditions for seizing power. The American occupation has plunged the working people into poverty and unemployment, while it has allowed local lackeys and local emperors to occupy positions of power. The feudal lands of the canal and banana plantations are the factories for Panama's congressmen and presidents. Panamanian laws are made from these places. However, whenever a successive government cannot serve the intentions of the Americans, when the pressure of the people can no longer be contained, the American robbers have to come up with a special trick. Thus, the imperialist feudal lords use so-called American-made coups to replace a batch of puppets. Coups are a crude form of imperialism disguising its interference in our internal affairs. No country on our beautiful continent is immune to coups. To some extent, the history of Latin America is the history of American-made coups.

Delegates, this region in the Pacific Ocean is the center of activity for American capitalists. The US Permanent Military Conference operates in this place. It is from this place that they exploit the workers of Central America and the Caribbean, where they separate blacks from whites, destroy national aspirations, and extract millions of dollars... It is from here that the insatiable capitalist jackals rule Latin America. It is from here that they pull the strings controlling Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, which explains why the labor of Nicaraguan workers under the "tropical palm trees" is so painful, why Honduran miners die from lung disease, why the hands and feet of the people of Costa Rica are as pale and dry as agave plants, why the will of the people of the Antilles is worn down, and why Panamanian workers lose their strength and their language. With the help of coups, the imperialists are able to establish a dictatorial network of white descendants, where petty dictators are smug about swallowing blood and wealth, and kowtow to the Florida Peninsula. To avoid disgusting everyone at the meeting, I will not mention their names.

For this reason, the Panama and Caribbean Command is located in Balboa, in the Canal Zone. Under the shadow of cannons, the noise of airplanes, and the range of destroyer guns, it is not only our small country, but the entire region. The Panama and Caribbean region includes Venezuela, Colombia, and Central America. Not only our cocoa, hemp, and bananas, but also the oil of Venezuela, Colombia, and Costa Rica, the cattle and sheep of Honduras, and the coffee of Guatemala. The Panama and Caribbean Command not only has information about the military, but also about geography, soil, underground mineral resources, and our economy. It not only possesses important files, but most importantly, it possesses archives... blacklists written in code with ordinary names - the names of peaceful warriors fighting for national liberation, patriotic women, and revolutionary youth. Their files are files of war, and when the day comes when they want to imprison the elite of those who are fighting for human happiness in dark and gloomy prisons, these files will play an important role.

This organization works as precisely as a clock, but this is not enough for American policy. It needs a circus to match the firing of the Canal's cannons. Political rhetoric is necessary. Therefore, we see that today there is a movement advocating a Central American alliance. What the American devils want is to connect their properties, oil fields, and banana plantations; reduce tariffs; move freely in joy; gather their supervisors, guns, tear gas, and grapeshot; rob with steel knives and wooden sticks, and because of their insatiable greed, they cannot be satisfied with piecemeal plunder, but want to plunder everything. While they are uniting the exploiters of the people, they are dividing the workers of Panama and Costa Rica; they are provoking student relations, interrupting cultural exchanges, and undermining the unity in the struggle for peaceful construction and national independence.

Delegates: The true patriots of Central America do indeed hope to establish an alliance... hope to establish a federation... but a federation of the people, a federation of the workers who are being exploited in the banana plantations of Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador today. We do not want a federation of bandits and thieves under the leadership of belligerent imperialism, but an alliance of democratic people under the progressive pentagram and the lovely dove of peace softly calling and flapping its wings.

If this is the imperialist attack in political and economic terms, then its cultural and social offensive is equally fierce. The overwhelming power of the United States has destroyed our culture, as can be seen from the following: movies depicting hooligans and bandits, broadcasts of the Voice of America, a large number of comic books depicting pornography and crime, our stores spread the habit of using English, and waiters in our cafes explain the menu in English. The passage of infantry and marines through the canal brings scenes of chaos and corruption. The streets of the cities at both ends of the canal, Panama City and Colón, are full of soldiers and sailors, who have almost occupied the entire place. Our saying goes: "Panamanians, pay attention! The fleet is coming..." In ordinary Panamanian language, this means fathers, watch out for your daughters; husbands, guard your wives; vegetable vendors, display your goods; bar owners, let the soldiers know that your bar is open; Panama National Police, prepare to be beaten by American soldiers in front of the Canal Zone military police patrolling our streets; unfortunate Cuban, Costa Rican, and Chilean women, prepare to sell yourselves in dance halls and other places of depravity and corruption.

Racial discrimination is prevalent in the Panama Canal Zone, where the only white people are Americans, and racial discrimination is also widespread in some socially important places and some private schools.

But, despite the imperialist exploitation in the Canal Zone, cultural aggression, pompous guns, and petty kings living high on the hog, the people of Panama have been acting fiercely, resolutely, and bravely. They have struggled time and time again against tyrannical rule, against those who sell out the interests of the people, and against all forms of imperialism.

This activity is the battle of the entire people, including small merchants, small industrialists and businessmen, workers, farmers, students, professors, and women.

Long after the end of the anti-fascist war and the surrender of Japan, the United States still wanted to continue to use the air force bases it had acquired throughout Panama. The Panamanian government had originally entered into an agreement with the United States to hand over these bases to the United States unconditionally, but after the war, the Americans insisted that the threat of war still existed and demanded a new agreement, allowing the United States to continue to use these bases for thirty years, and to extend it for another thirty years after the expiration of the new agreement. The Americans insisted that this was necessary because the threat of war still existed. The people asked: "Who is threatened?" The Americans replied: This must be done for peace and the security of the Americas. The Panamanian people resolutely opposed this myth of imperialism, and despite the imperialist guns, they swarmed to the streets, and despite the shooting and tear gas, forced the Panamanian National Assembly to refuse to ratify this new agreement.

About two years ago, maybe a little earlier or a little later, a local emperor in our country at that time, in order to show the imperialists a hand, gathered a group of volunteers to fight in Korea. Among the extremely poor people, only those who wanted to leave the country or go abroad to venture joined, and there were 300 of them in total. These people were very happy because in this way, their economic problems would be solved. However, alas! What a great irony. After these volunteer soldiers underwent physical examinations, the military authorities rejected the Panamanian government's courtesy, because this group either had spondylitis or was full of lice, either had lung disease or suffered from other diseases. This group did not have enough blood to fight... The despicable shamelessness of our government has reached such a degree.

Nevertheless, more than two hundred Panamanians joined the US Army. Although they enjoyed the same treatment as Americans, they, like Colombians, ran to Korea, and not only lost their lives, but also lost their nationality.

One of them was very willing to go to Korea to fight, because he thought that imperialism was invincible and that the Korean patriots were only fighting with bows and arrows. Later he came back – in a black coffin. Coincidentally, in those days, an important Panamanian died - he was a student, and he was an outstanding fighter in the struggle to drive the Americans out of the air force base. On the one hand, the government promoted the funeral of that so-called "patriot" who died to defend the freedom of Korea, and on the other hand, the Canal Zone authorities also sent troops and greatly exaggerated it. They wanted to say that the funeral of the soldier who died in Korea was of great significance. But the student, the funeral of that true patriot, although they did not boast about it, the people went to participate in groups, and did not go to participate in the funeral of the murderer who murdered the Koreans. Our people answered the imperialist aggressors in such a simple way.

Delegates, this is what little Panama has to say at this great conference. Panama's significant anti-imperialist sentiment will drive our future struggle for peace. For this struggle, we need the help of Latin American countries threatened by the strong batteries of the Canal Zone to rescue our country - the White Haired Girl - from the American exploitation cave.

After we return to Panama, we will tell the people of Panama: the people of the Asian and Pacific regions do not want war. We will tell the Panamanian people the stories we have heard about the crimes of the imperialists in Asia. We will tell them about the construction enthusiasm of the great New China. We will tell them that when we were in Czechoslovakia, we wanted to find where the Iron Curtain was, but we tried so hard and still could not find it. We will tell people everywhere that the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference does not want the Canal Zone and the Caribbean Command to drop an atomic bomb on the Panama Canal to frame the Soviet Union in order to launch a war, because the atomic bomb will not only kill all the enemies of peace, but also kill the peace-loving people. We repeat, this beautiful canal must never be used for war! (Xinhua News Agency)

    巴拿马代表团团长、国家文学奖金得奖人
    卡罗斯·弗兰西斯科·钱玛林的发言（摘要）
    我们跨过了几个大陆，克服了美国谍报机关对我们的阻挠以及本国政府对我们的压迫才能前来，因此到得迟了一点。但是这些并没有阻止我们来到这里，来到这些热情洋溢的爱好和平的人士中间。我们来到这里不是为帝国主义强盗们谋利益，而是来兄弟般地与全世界各国人民分享这种感情；与争取和平斗争中流洒着热血的人们，特别是意志坚决的朝鲜、坚强的寮国、越南和马来亚，尤其是慈母般的中国，毛泽东的强大的祖国，新中国共同享受这种感情。
    巴拿马是拉丁美洲的“白毛女”。如果你在资本主义的地图上去找巴拿马，你们就会看到，由于那条运河，我们既不在玻利华尔的南美，也不在墨拉赞的中美。事实上，我们好像没有容身的地方。这都是由于美国豺狼们不愿意巴拿马成为一个自由的国家，而希望巴拿马变成在资本主义剥削黑洞中的“白毛女”。
    同时，当美国人夺取这条当初曾经由法国人开凿的运河时，他们也夺取了那段横贯地峡的铁路。他们攫夺了河里的水（例如，巴拿马城在使用源出于一条巴拿马河流的水时，必须付钱给美国政府）。他们攫夺了领空，后来又攫夺了电力。他们劫取了大片的土地；维持着香蕉的黄色统治；在他们劫取的土地上，豺狼舐食着橡胶树胶；这种情形迫害着我国无地的农民，也吞噬了哥斯达黎加、尼加拉瓜、洪都拉斯、萨尔瓦多和牙买加的农业劳动者。
    美国政府并不满足于掠夺这些财富，它在实际上已经占有了我国的道路、交通和地下矿藏。
    美国国务院的官员们准备了夺取政权的条件。美国的占领使劳动人民陷于穷困与失业的境地，而它却让本地的走狗和土皇帝占据着掌权的地位。运河和香蕉园的封建土地就是巴拿马议员与总统的制造所。从这些地方制定出巴拿马的法律。然而，每当继起的政府不能为美国人的意图效劳时，当人民的压力不能再被阻遏时，美国的强盗们就要出一个特别花样。于是帝国主义的封建主就用美国制造的所谓政变来换一批傀儡。政变是帝国主义掩饰其干涉我们各国内政的粗暴的形式。在我们这个美丽的大陆上，没有一个国家不受政变之害。拉丁美洲的历史在某些程度上来说，就是美制政变的历史。
    各位代表，太平洋上这个地区就是美国资本家活动的中心。美国常设军事会议就在这个地方活动。就是从这个地方出发，他们剥削中美和加勒比的工人，在这里他们把黑人与白种人隔开，他们摧毁民族的志气，他们榨取千百万的金钱……就是从这里出发，贪得无餍的资本主义豺狼统治着拉丁美洲。就是从这个地方出发，他们拉着控制哥斯达黎加、尼加拉瓜、萨尔瓦多、危地马拉和洪都拉斯的牵线，这就说明为什么尼加拉瓜工人在“热带棕榈树”下的劳动是那么痛苦，为什么洪都拉斯的矿工们因肺病而死亡，为什么哥斯达黎加人民的手足像龙舌兰树那样灰白和枯燥，为什么安的列斯群岛人的意志被消磨，为什么巴拿马工人丧失了他们的力量和他们的语言。帝国主义者借政变之助，能够建立一个白人子孙的独裁统治网，那儿的小独裁者以吞咽鲜血和财富而洋洋自得，向佛罗里达半岛卑躬屈膝。为了不愿在会议上使大家恶心，我不提他们的名字。
    为了这个原因，巴拿马及加勒比区司令部设在运河地区的巴尔菩亚活动。在大炮的阴影下，飞机的闹声下和驱逐舰枪炮的射程内的不仅是我们小小的国家，而是整个的区域。巴拿马及加勒比区，包括委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚和中美。不仅我们的可可、大麻和香蕉，还有委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚和哥斯达黎加的石油，洪都拉斯的牛羊，危地马拉的咖啡。巴拿马及加勒比区司令部不但有着关于军队的情报，还有关于地理、土壤和地下矿藏，以及我们经济的情报。它不但拥有重要的卷宗，最重要的是，它是拥有档案……用密码写的普通姓名的黑名单——为民族解放而斗争的和平战士，爱国妇女和革命青年的姓名。他们的卷宗是战争的卷宗，当有一天他们要把为人类幸福而斗争的人们中的精华监禁到黑暗阴郁的监狱中去的时候，这些卷宗就将发生重要的作用。
    这个组织像时钟一样精密地在进行工作，但这对美国的政策说来还是不够的。它需要一个马戏团，来配合运河大炮的发射。政治上的花言巧语是必需的。因此我们看到，今天有着一个主张中美联盟的运动。美国鬼子所希望的是把他们的财产、油田和香蕉园连接起来；减低关税；沉浸在欢乐里自由来往；把他们的总管、枪炮、催泪弹和葡萄弹汇集起来；用钢刀和木棍来抢劫，由于他们的贪得无餍，他们不能满足于零碎的掠夺而要整个地来掠夺。当他们一面把人民的剥削者联合起来，一面在分裂巴拿马和哥斯达黎加的工人；他们挑拨学生的关系，打断文化的交流，破坏争取和平建设，争取民族独立的斗争中的团结。
    各位代表：中美洲真正的爱国者的确希望成立联盟……希望成立联邦……但是要人民的联邦，今日在巴拿马、哥斯达黎加、洪都拉斯、尼加拉瓜和萨尔瓦多的香蕉园中被剥削的工人的联邦。我们不要在好战的帝国主义领导下的匪徒和盗贼的联邦，而要一个在进步的五角星和柔和地叫着和扑着翅膀的可爱的和平鸽下面的民主人民的盟邦。
    如果这就是帝国主义在政治和经济方面的攻击，那么，它在文化和社会方面的进攻也是同样凶猛。美国的压倒势力摧毁了我们的文化，这可以从下列种种看出来：描写流氓和匪徒的电影，美国之音的广播，大批描写色情和犯罪的连环画，我们的商店散布用英文的习气，我们咖啡馆的侍者用英文解释菜单。步兵和海军陆战队通过运河时带来骚乱和腐化的景色。在运河两头的城市巴拿马城和科伦的街道上尽是兵士和水兵，他们几乎把整个地方都占去了。我们的俗话说：“巴拿马人，注意！舰队来了……”，用平常的巴拿马话来说，这意味着父亲们，当心你们的女儿；丈夫们，看守着你们的妻子；卖菜的小贩，摆出你们的货物来吧；酒吧间老板，让兵士们知道你们的酒吧已开市吧；巴拿马国家警察们，准备当着在我们街上巡逻的运河区宪兵的面遭受美国兵士的殴打吧；不幸的古巴、哥斯达黎加和智利的女人，准备在跳舞场和其他堕落腐化的地方出卖你们自己吧。
    种族歧视盛行于巴拿马运河区，那里仅有的白人就是美国人，在若干具有社会重要性的地方和某些私立学校中，种族歧视也广泛地存在着。
    但是，不顾帝国主义在运河区的大量剥削、文化侵略、神气十足的枪炮和混日子的小国王，巴拿马的人民一直是激烈地、坚决地、勇敢地行动着。他们一次又一次地进行斗争，反对暴虐统治，反对那些出卖人民利益的人，反对各种各样形式的帝国主义。
    这种活动是全体人民的战斗，包括小商贩、小工商业者、工人、农民、学生、教授和妇女。
    在反法西斯战争结束和日本投降之后许久，美国还想继续使用它所获得的巴拿马各地的空军基地。巴拿马政府本来和美国订有一项协定，并无条件地把这些基地交给美国，但是战后，美国人一口咬定战争威胁仍然存在，要求成立新协定，准许美国继续使用这些基地三十年，并得在新协定满期后再延长三十年。美国人坚持说，这样做是必要的，因为战争威胁仍然存在。人民问：“威胁着谁呢？”美国人回答说：为了和平和美洲的安全，必须这样做。巴拿马人民坚决地反对帝国主义的这种神话，他们不顾帝国主义的枪炮，蜂涌到街头，不顾枪击、催泪弹迫使了巴拿马国民议会拒绝批准这个新协定。
    大约在两年以前，也许早一点也许晚一点，我们国家当时的一个土皇帝，为了要向帝国主义者表现一手，召集一批志愿军到朝鲜去作战。在极穷苦的人中间，想离开本国的或是想到国外去冒险的人才参加，他们总共有三百人。这些人非常高兴，因为这样一来，他们的经济问题就解决了。然而，唉！这是多么大的一个讽刺。在这群志愿军士兵们检查了身体以后，军事当局却拒绝了巴拿马政府的所献的殷勤，原因是这群人不是有着脊椎炎就是满身虱子，不是有肺病就是患着别的疾病。这群人没有足够的鲜血去打仗……我国政府的卑鄙无耻竟到了这样的程度。
    尽管如此，还是有二百多个巴拿马人参加了美国陆军。他们虽然享受着俨然像美国人一样的待遇，但是他们也像哥伦比亚人一样，跑到朝鲜，不但丧失他们的性命，也丧失了国籍。
    他们当中有一个人很愿意到朝鲜去打仗，他以为帝国主义是所向无敌的，朝鲜的爱国者们只不过用弓箭作战。后来他回来了——装在一口黑色的棺材里。恰巧就在那几天，一位重要的巴拿马人死了——他是一个学生，在把美国人赶出空军基地的斗争中他是一个杰出的斗士。一方面，政府对那个所谓为了保卫朝鲜的自由而死去的“爱国者”的出殡大事宣传，另一方面运河区当局也派出军队和大大加以渲染。他们要把这个在朝鲜死去的士兵的出殡说成是具有极大重要意义的事情。但是，那个学生，那个真正的爱国者的殡葬，虽然没有他们大事吹擂，人民却都成群结队地去参加，而不去参加那个谋害朝鲜人的杀人犯的出殡。我国人民就用这样简单的方式回答了帝国主义侵略者。
    各位代表，这就是小小的巴拿马要在这次伟大的会议上说的话。巴拿马的显著的反帝国主义情绪，将推动我们未来争取和平的斗争。为了这个斗争，我们需要拉丁美洲受到运河区强大的炮台的威胁的国家给以帮助，来把我国——白毛女喜儿——从美国剥削的山洞中救出来。
    我们回巴拿马以后，要告诉巴拿马的人民：亚洲及太平洋区域各国的人民不要战争。我们要告诉巴拿马人民我们所听到的关于帝国主义者在亚洲的罪行的情节。我们要告诉他们伟大的新中国的建设热情。我们要告诉他们，在捷克斯洛伐克的时候，我们要想找寻铁幕在哪里，但是费尽力气还是没有找到。我们要到处告诉人民，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议并不希望运河区和加勒比海司令部在巴拿马运河上投一颗原子弹来嫁祸苏联以发动战争，因为原子弹不仅会杀死所有和平的敌人，而且也会杀死爱好和平的人。我们重复一遍说，这条美丽的运河决不能用于战争！（新华社）
