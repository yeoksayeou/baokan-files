Editorial

    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, lasting eleven days, successfully concluded yesterday. The conference extensively discussed the current situation in the Asian and Pacific regions and reached unanimous resolutions on various important issues concerning the struggle for and defense of peace. These resolutions fully reflect the firm will of the sixteen hundred million people in the Asian and Pacific regions to urgently demand peace and oppose war, and provide a clear program of action for the people of all countries to further strengthen and expand the common struggle to defend peace.
    Today, the Asian and Pacific regions are suffering from the disasters of war or facing serious threats of war, and the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries cannot be realized. In discussing this situation, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference unanimously agreed that this is the result of the US government's pursuit of its aggressive policy in the Asian and Pacific regions. For example, the US aggressors launched the aggressive war in Korea, and today are still delaying and undermining the armistice negotiations, plotting to expand the aggressive war; still occupying China's territory of Taiwan; openly turning Japan into a military base for aggression, supporting the revival of Japanese militarism; expanding military bases everywhere, forcing many countries to conclude aggressive military agreements; and everywhere provoking ethnic conflicts and religious disputes, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and suppressing national independence movements in various countries. These aggressive acts of the US government are in complete violation of all international laws, especially incompatible with the United Nations Charter. As everyone knows, the United Nations was established to save mankind "from the scourge of war," and the United Nations Charter stipulates that its responsibility is to maintain world peace and security and prevent aggressive wars. Therefore, in addition to passing the "Appeal to the People of the World," calling on the people of all countries to rise up to strive for and defend peace and stop all crimes of the US aggressors, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference also passed the "Letter to the United Nations," calling on the United Nations to earnestly fulfill its own responsibilities and stop all conspiracies of the US aggressors to expand the war. However, people know that since the United Nations was established seven years ago, it has not only violated the principles of the Charter and turned a blind eye to various aggressive acts of the US aggressors, but the US aggressors have even carried out the aggressive war in Korea in the name of the United Nations. The seven proposals put forward by the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to the United Nations provide the United Nations with an opportunity to restore its prestige lost among the people of the world. All member states of the United Nations should guarantee the implementation of the various principles of the United Nations Charter, so that the United Nations becomes an institution that maintains peace in accordance with the wishes of the people of the world.
    The current main task of defending peace in the Asian and Pacific regions is to stop the revival of Japanese militarist forces, guarantee Japan's national independence and the democratic rights of the Japanese people, so that Japan can become an independent, democratic, and peace-loving Japan. The "Resolution on the Japanese Issue" of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, as well as the reports and speeches of representatives of various countries at the Peace Conference, clearly reflect this demand of the Japanese people and the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions. The reason why the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions are so concerned about the Japanese issue is that many countries have suffered for a long time from the disasters of the Japanese militarist aggressive war, and the wounds have not yet healed; and now the US aggressors want to support the Japanese militarist forces as the main accomplices of the United States in carrying out aggressive wars; and the Japanese militarist forces are also dreaming of relying on the support of the US aggressors to make a comeback and repeat the aggression. This is absolutely not allowed by the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions. The facts of the past year show that the Japanese Yoshida government, in accordance with the orders of the US government, is accelerating the restoration of the Japanese army and navy, releasing a large number of war criminals, re-employing former fascist military officers, and restoring the production of heavy weapons such as airplanes and tanks; the US aggression against Korea was carried out with Japan as a base. The accelerated revival of Japanese militarist forces is increasingly seriously threatening the peace and security of various countries. This not only violates the wishes of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions, but also completely violates the interests of the Japanese people, and has therefore been resolutely resisted by the Japanese people. At present, the Japanese people are making unremitting efforts to establish an independent, democratic, free, and peaceful new Japan, which is an extremely important force in our struggle to defend peace and oppose the militarization of Japan in the Asian and Pacific regions. The people of all countries should support this heroic and just action of the Japanese people. The "Resolution on the Japanese Issue" of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference calls for stopping the conspiracy of the US aggressors to revive Japanese militarist forces, and advocates concluding a genuine peace treaty with Japan that guarantees the Japanese people's right to independence, peace, and democracy, and agrees that the Japanese people should maintain armed forces for self-defense under such conditions. This resolution fully expresses the wishes and will of the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, including the Japanese people. Because an independent, democratic, and peace-loving Japan is an important factor in maintaining peace and stability in the Asian and Pacific regions.
    Another urgent task of defending peace in the Asian and Pacific regions is to immediately stop the Korean War and quickly restore peace in Korea. For more than a year since the Korean armistice negotiations, the US aggressors have been delaying and undermining the Korean armistice negotiations in order to continue to maintain the tense situation in the world, so that it can mobilize to expand its arms and prepare for war and expand its aggressive war. In order to achieve this ulterior motive, the US aggressors disregarded international credibility, violated the principles of the Geneva Convention, which it had signed itself in 1949, violated the draft armistice agreement clauses that had been agreed upon by both sides, attempted to forcibly detain prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and frequently carried out barbaric massacres in prisoner-of-war camps such as Koje Island and Nonsan; the US aggressors also violated the 1925 Geneva Protocol, and carried out inhumane bacteriological warfare in Korea and our country, and used chemical weapons, napalm bombs, and other large-scale killing weapons, and barbarically bombed peaceful facilities and peaceful people in Korea, massacring a large number of women, the elderly, and children, and destroying many peaceful cities and towns and cultural relics. All peace-loving people are eager to stop the Korean War in order to pave the way for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and other issues in the Far East. However, the US aggressors, disregarding the peaceful wishes of the people of the world, recently resolutely refused to negotiate and unilaterally announced an indefinite recess of the armistice negotiations, obviously deliberately continuing to prolong and expand the aggressive war against Korea. This further poses a serious threat to peace and security in the Asian and Pacific regions. The "Resolution on the Korean Issue" of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is the only just and feasible way to stop the Korean War and restore peace in Korea. The people of all countries should take active action to force the US government to accept this just peace, thereby stopping the US aggression against Korea from being prolonged and the war from being expanded to other regions.
    In view of the fact that the national independence movements in many countries in the Asian and Pacific regions are being obstructed by foreign interventionists, especially the US aggressors are establishing military bases everywhere, seriously infringing upon the sovereignty of various countries, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and plundering the resources of various countries, and these countries are eagerly hoping to gain independence and freedom, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference passed the "Resolution on National Independence Issues," expressing concern and sympathy for the just demands of the people of these countries, which will undoubtedly encourage the people of these countries to demand independence and peace. In his welcoming speech at the opening of the Peace Conference, Comrade Peng Zhen, deputy head of the Chinese delegation, explained the correct relationship between the issue of national independence and the peace movement: "Guaranteeing and realizing genuine national independence is an absolutely necessary condition for establishing peace, because genuine peace can never be established on the basis of one country enslaving another country or arbitrarily infringing upon the sovereignty of another country. To achieve genuine peace, the national independence of all countries must be respected and guaranteed, and no country can interfere in the internal affairs of other countries in any way." Therefore, any oppressed country rising up to fight for national independence is precisely for the sake of defending genuine peace and should be sympathized with and supported.
    The people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions have always had extremely close economic and cultural ties. Developing economic and cultural exchanges between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit without discrimination will help improve the living standards of the people of various countries, enhance mutual understanding among the people of various countries, and strengthen and consolidate the friendship and cooperation between the people of various countries. However, in recent years, the US government, for the aggressive purpose of expanding its arms and preparing for war, has forced many countries to implement its embargo policy, plundering the resources of various countries in large quantities and monopolizing the markets of various countries, bringing unemployment, hunger, and pain to many countries, and further increasing international tensions. The "Resolution on Economic Exchange Issues" and the "Resolution on Cultural Exchange Issues" of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference are aimed at breaking this artificial and unreasonable phenomenon and promoting economic and cultural exchanges between countries, which is obviously beneficial to the people of all countries and helps the cause of defending peace.
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference also passed the "Resolution on Intensifying the Movement to Strive for the Conclusion of a Peace Pact by the Five Great Powers," the "Resolution on Women's Rights and Children's Welfare," the "Resolution on Supporting the Convening of the World People's Peace Congress," and the "Resolution on Establishing the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee," etc. These are all extremely important measures for defending the cause of peace in the Asian and Pacific regions and the world. The people of all countries will undoubtedly receive great encouragement from these resolutions and will wage a more resolute struggle to achieve the great goals stipulated in these documents.
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has achieved such great success mainly because the representatives of various countries have a clear and unanimous understanding of the current situation in the Asian and Pacific regions, correctly reflecting the will of the people of various countries to demand peace and oppose war, and holding unlimited enthusiasm and confidence in the cause of defending peace. Therefore, the three hundred and sixty-seven representatives who participated in this Peace Conference, although they came from thirty-seven different countries, had various different political views, different religious beliefs, and different nationalities and occupations, were able to unite together, put the common interests of peace in the first place, and carry out the work of defending peace with a high degree of democratic consultation, so that various resolutions were successfully adopted unanimously. This demonstrates the unprecedented unity of the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions. The victorious success of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will not only have a huge and profound impact on the peace movement in the Asian and Pacific regions, but also make a significant contribution to the world's cause of defending peace. It will mobilize and organize more and more people to join the struggle to defend peace, thereby creating favorable conditions for the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna this December.
    The Chinese people warmly hail the great success of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, firmly support the various resolutions of the conference, and will fight to the end for the thorough implementation of these resolutions. We hope that after returning to their own countries, the representatives of various countries will widely disseminate the spirit and resolutions of this Peace Conference among the people, strive to popularize it deeply among the people, and mobilize and organize more and more peace-loving people to work hard for the common interests of peace. Collecting the will of thousands of people can be transformed into infinite power; the enemies of peace will be more isolated, war can be stopped, and peace can be ensured.

### 拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各项决议

    拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各项决议
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，历时十一天，已于昨日圆满闭幕。会议广泛地讨论了当前亚洲及太平洋区域的形势，对有关争取和保卫和平的各项重要问题，作出了一致的决议。这些决议，充分地反映了亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民迫切要求和平、反对战争的坚决意志，为各国人民进一步加强和扩大保卫和平的共同斗争，提供了一个明确的行动纲领。
    今天亚洲及太平洋区域正遭受着战争的灾难，或者面临着严重的战争威胁，各国人民的和平愿望无法实现。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在讨论这种形势中，一致认为这是美国政府在亚洲及太平洋区域推行其侵略政策的结果。如美国侵略者发动了朝鲜的侵略战争，今天仍在拖延和破坏停战谈判，阴谋扩大侵略战争；仍然侵占着中国领土台湾；公然把日本变成军事侵略基地，扶植日本军国主义复活；到处扩充军事基地，强迫许多国家缔结侵略性军事协定；并到处挑拨民族冲突和宗教纠纷，干涉别国内政，镇压各国的民族独立运动。美国政府这些侵略行为，是完全违反一切国际公法的，尤其是与联合国宪章不相容的。大家知道，联合国是为了拯救人类“免于战祸”而建立的，联合国的宪章规定，它的职责是维护世界和平与安全及阻止侵略战争。因此，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议除通过了“告全世界人民书”，呼吁各国人民起来争取与保卫和平，制止美国侵略者的一切罪行外，还通过了“致联合国书”，呼吁联合国切实履行它自己的职责，制止美国侵略者扩大战争的一切阴谋。但是，人们知道联合国自成立七年以来，不仅违反了宪章原则，对美国侵略者的各种侵略行为熟视无睹，而且美国侵略者竟用联合国的名义在朝鲜进行着侵略战争。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议向联合国所提出的七项建议，是向联合国提供了恢复它在全世界人民中所失去的威信的机会。联合国各会员国家都应该保证执行联合国宪章的各项原则，使联合国成为符合于全世界人民愿望的维护和平的机构。
    保卫亚洲及太平洋区域和平的当前主要任务，就是必须制止日本军国主义势力的复活，保证日本的民族独立和日本人民的民主权利，以便使日本成为一个独立、民主与爱好和平的日本。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议“关于日本问题的决议”以及各国代表在和平会议上的报告和发言，都明确地反映了日本人民和亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的这种要求。亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民，对日本问题所以这样关切，是因为许多国家过去长期遭受日本军国主义侵略战争的灾难，至今创痕未复；而美国侵略者现在又要把日本军国主义势力扶植起来，作为美国进行侵略战争的主要帮凶；而日本军国主义势力也在梦想依靠美国侵略者的扶植，卷土重来，重演侵略，这是亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民所绝对不能允许的。过去一年中的事实表明，日本吉田政府按照美国政府的命令，正在加紧恢复日本的陆军和海军，释放大批战犯，起用旧日的法西斯军官，恢复飞机、坦克等重武器的生产；美国侵略朝鲜的战争，就是以日本为基地进行的。日本军国主义势力的加速复活，越来越严重地威胁着各国的和平与安全。这不仅违背亚洲及太平洋区域人民的愿望，也是完全违背日本人民的利益的，因此已经遭到日本人民的坚决反抗。目前日本人民正为建立一个独立、民主、自由、和平的新日本而进行着不懈的努力，这是我们亚洲及太平洋区域保卫和平、反对日本军国主义化的斗争中的一支极为重要的力量。各国人民应当支持日本人民这种英勇的正义行动。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议“关于日本问题的决议”中，号召制止美国侵略者复活日本军国主义势力的阴谋，主张缔结一个保证日本人民取得独立、和平、民主权利的真正的对日和约，在这样的条件下并同意日本人民保有自卫的武装力量。这个决议完全表达了包括日本人民在内的亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的愿望和意志。因为一个独立的民主的爱好和平的日本，是亚洲及太平洋区域保持和平与安定的重要因素。
    保卫亚洲及太平洋区域和平的另一个急迫的任务，就是立即停止朝鲜战争，迅速恢复朝鲜的和平。朝鲜停战谈判一年多来，由于美国侵略者要继续保持世界的紧张局势，以便它动员扩军备战，扩大侵略战争，一直在拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判。为了达到这一不可告人的目的，美国侵略者不顾国际信义，破坏了一九四九年它自己曾签字的日内瓦公约的原则，违背了双方已经达成协议的停战协定草案条款，企图强迫扣留朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员，并在巨济岛、论山等地战俘营中经常进行野蛮的屠杀；美国侵略者又破坏了一九二五年日内瓦议定书，在朝鲜和我国进行了灭绝人性的细菌战，并使用了化学武器、凝固汽油弹等大规模杀人武器，对朝鲜的和平设施、和平人民进行野蛮轰炸，屠杀了大批妇女、老人和儿童，毁灭了许多和平城乡和文化古物。一切爱好和平的人民都渴望着停止朝鲜战争，以便为和平解决朝鲜问题和远东其他问题开辟道路。可是，美国侵略者不顾世界人民的这种和平愿望，最近更断然拒绝协商，片面宣布停战谈判无限期休会，显然是在蓄意继续延长和扩大对朝鲜的侵略战争。这就进一步造成了对亚洲及太平洋区域和平安全的严重威胁。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议“关于朝鲜问题的决议”，是停止朝鲜战争、恢复朝鲜和平的唯一公正可行的办法。各国人民应该积极行动起来，迫使美国政府接受这个公正的和平，从而制止美国侵略朝鲜战争的延长和把战火扩大到其他地区。
    鉴于亚洲及太平洋区域许多国家的民族独立运动，正遭受着外国干涉者的阻挠，尤其是美国侵略者到处建立军事基地，严重地侵犯各国的主权，干涉别国的内政，掠夺各国的资源，而这些国家迫切地渴望着获得独立自由，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议通过了“关于民族独立问题的决议”，对这些国家人民的正义要求寄予关切和同情，这无疑将鼓舞这些国家人民要求独立、要求和平的信心。我国代表团副团长彭真同志在和平会议开幕时的欢迎词中，对于民族独立问题与保卫和平运动的正确关系曾有所说明：“保障和实现真正的民族独立，是建立和平的绝对必要的条件，因为真正的和平，决不可能建立在一个国家奴役另一个国家或任意侵犯另一国家的主权的基础上。要实现真正的和平，各国的民族独立必须受到尊重和保证，任何国家不能以任何方式去干涉别国的内政。”因此，任何被压迫的国家起来争取民族的独立，正是为了保卫真正的和平，应该受到同情和支持。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民间，历来在经济方面和文化方面，都有着极密切的联系。各国在平等互利的基础上，不加歧视地发展互相间的经济交流和文化交流，将会有助于各国人民生活水平的提高，增进各国人民之间的相互了解，增强和巩固各国人民之间的友谊和合作。可是，近年以来，美国政府为了扩军备战的侵略目的，强迫许多国家执行其封锁禁运政策，以大量掠夺各国的资源，垄断各国的市场，给许多国家带来了失业、饥饿和痛苦，更增加了国际间的紧张局势。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议“关于经济交流问题决议”和“关于文化交流问题决议”，就是要打破这种人为的不合理的现象，促进各国之间的经济和文化的交流，这显然是有利于各国人民，有助于保卫和平的事业的。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议还通过了“关于加紧争取五大国缔结和平公约运动的决议”、“关于妇女权利与儿童福利的决议”、“关于拥护召开世界人民和平大会的决议”、“关于建立亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会的决议”等，这都是对于保卫亚洲、太平洋区域和全世界和平事业的极重要的措施，各国人民无疑将从这些决议中获得重大的鼓舞力量，来为实现这些文件所规定的伟大目标进行更坚决的斗争。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议获得这样重大的成就，主要是基于各国代表对于当前亚洲及太平洋区域的形势有着明确的一致的认识，正确地反映了各国人民要求和平、反对战争的意志，对保卫和平事业抱着无限的热忱和信心。因此，参加这个和平会议的三百六十七位代表，他们虽然来自三十七个不同的国家，具有各种不同的政治见解，不同的宗教信仰，不同的民族和职业，却能够一致团结起来，把共同的和平利益放在首要的地位，用高度的民主协商的精神进行保卫和平的工作，致使各项决议得以顺利地获得一致的通过，这表现了亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的空前团结。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的胜利成功，这不仅对于亚洲及太平洋区域保卫和平运动，必将发生巨大而深刻的影响，而且对世界保卫和平事业也作出了重大的贡献，它必将动员和组织更广大的人民投入到保卫和平的斗争中来，从而为今年十二月在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会创造了有利的条件。
    中国人民热烈欢呼亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的伟大成功，坚决拥护会议的各项决议，并将为彻底实现这些决议而奋斗到底。我们希望各国代表回到自己的国内后，把这个和平会议的精神和决议，在人民中间进行广泛的传达，力求普及深入人心，动员和组织更多更广泛的爱好和平的人民，为了共同的和平利益而努力。集合千万人的意志，就可以化为无穷的力量；和平的敌人就会更加陷于孤立，战争就可以制止，和平就可以确保。
