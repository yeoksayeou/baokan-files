    An Ordinary Shop Assistant
    Fu Dong
    One day, a farmer came to the No. 1 Department Store of the Beijing Wangfujing Department Store. "Uncle, what would you like to buy?" A young female shop assistant greeted him with a smile. The farmer took out a piece of paper from his pocket with the following written on it: "Seven chi of large red floral foreign cloth, seven chi of lilac serge, seven chi of green floral cloth..." He handed the paper to the shop assistant and said with a smile, "It's a good year, we have money, so I'll buy some fashionable floral clothes to make a dowry for my daughter." The female shop assistant chose the fabric on the shelves as if she were choosing it for herself, and finally took out a piece of bright red floral cloth and presented it to the farmer: "This material is good, what do you think?" The farmer touched it, asked the price, and said, "Do you have anything even more floral? These days, girls in the countryside love to dress up and wear the most floral clothes." The female shop assistant immediately stood on a stool and took down the most floral material from the shelf, holding it up against herself and saying, "This material would look especially good on a young girl!" The female shop assistant patiently took out each item for him and said to him, "Take your time, don't rush, buy something that you really like." Her words made the customer smile.
    This young female shop assistant's name is Zheng Cairong. She is patient and enthusiastic towards customers. A large crowd often gathers in front of her counter. Before one person has finished choosing, another comes to ask for goods, but no matter how busy she is, she always says with a smile, "Comrade, please wait a moment, I'll be right with you!" Many people who have bought cloth from her often look for her as soon as they enter the store the second time. Whether the customer buys something or not, she always makes sure they leave satisfied.
    What force makes Comrade Zheng Cairong treat customers with such patience and enthusiasm?
    When Zheng Cairong was a child, her family was so poor that they didn't even have cornbread to eat; the clothes she wore were all made from her older sister's old clothes. One year, the family finally saved some money and wanted to make her a Haichang blue gown. She excitedly ran to the entrance of a not-so-small cloth store. However, she saw that the people going in and out of this cloth store were all Kuomintang officers in woolen military uniforms and heavily made-up ladies, and she didn't dare to go in. At that time, who would notice a poor girl like her? She stood outside the display window, looking and choosing again and again, until she had completely chosen what she wanted before finally walking into the store. She stood in the store for a long time, but no one paid attention to her. She saw the shopkeeper's eyes glance over her several times, but he immediately went back to greeting those gentlemen and ladies. It wasn't until almost all the customers had left that the shopkeeper slowly walked over, looking impatient, and asked her what she wanted to buy. She didn't dare to choose carefully and hurriedly bought a piece of Haichang blue gown material and ran out. She took this material, which was said to be "never fading," back home, measured it with a ruler, and found that the size was not enough; after being washed once, it shrank a lot; after being washed a few times, the color faded into patches of blue and white. She was sad for many days because of this "Haichang blue" gown. Now that she is a shop assistant in a state-owned store, she has never forgotten that sad event. She often thinks, "The money of the working class comes hard-earned, I can't let them buy unsatisfactory things." She is so considerate of customers, for example, she always tells customers clearly how much a certain cloth will shrink after being washed.
    One day, Zheng Cairong was working busily when a female comrade from the People's Liberation Army walked over and said, "Comrade, why is the attitude of the comrade selling hot water bottles in the Second Department Store different from yours?" Zheng Cairong asked and learned that this female comrade planned to buy a dozen small hot water bottles and half a dozen large hot water bottles, but she was so angry because of the shop assistant's bad attitude that she didn't buy them. She immediately said, "I'll go buy them with you." After the customer left, she said to the shop assistant, "Comrade, don't forget what the leaders told us, our work has a great impact on the production and life of the masses. She is a female comrade from the army, maybe sick PLA comrades are waiting in bed to use hot water bottles!" From then on, the comrade selling hot water bottles changed her work attitude.
    When Zheng Cairong started learning to sell cloth, some backward elements said, "What a joke. I've never seen a woman selling cloth before. It takes three years for a man to learn to sell cloth and stand behind the counter. Can a teenager handle the cloth?" After hearing these words, she was a little discouraged. When the leaders found out, they said to her, "Have you seen the movie 'General Without Feet'? Do you know why he can still fly a plane even without feet? In New China, as long as you work hard, is there any difficulty that can't be overcome?" Zheng Cairong remembered the apprentice in the shop across from her house when she was a child, who got up every day before dawn, stood behind the counter all day, and also had to light the fire, cook, and empty the spittoons, so busy that he couldn't even drink a mouthful of water. And the boss would often beat and kick him. She also remembered that after she came to the company, the leader of the cloth group got up an hour and a half early every morning to teach her how to use the abacus and measure cloth, and after settling the accounts at ten o'clock in the evening, he taught her how to measure and tear cloth. She thought: Why do the leaders teach and help me so carefully? From then on, she studied even harder. In less than three months, she learned everything that used to take three years to learn before liberation. Now she can not only sell cloth, but also sell more than others. She often overfulfills her tasks and can also help others. Zheng Cairong said, "Every day I stand behind the counter, and I feel unspeakably happy when I see people squeezing out in batches in front and people squeezing in in groups behind. My work adds happiness and joy to them, why shouldn't I be happy?"

    普通一店员
    傅冬
    有一天，北京王府井大街百货公司第一商场来了一个农民。“老乡，你要买点什么呀？”一位年青的女售货员笑嘻嘻地招呼他。这个农民从口袋里掏出一个纸条子，上面写着：“大红花洋布七尺，雪青哔叽七尺，绿色花布七尺……”。他把纸条子递给售货员，笑着说：“好年成，有了钱，买几件时兴的花衣裳，给闺女作嫁装。”女售货员就像给自己选衣料一样，在货架子上挑了又挑，最后拿出一匹鲜艳的大红花布，送到农民的面前：“这料子不错，你看怎么样？”这个农民摸了摸，问了问价钱，说：“有再花一点的吗？这阵子乡下闺女都爱打扮了，爱穿顶花的衣裳。”女售货员立刻站到凳子上，从货架上取下一匹最花的料子，在自己身上比划着说：“这料子年青姑娘穿上再好看不过啦！”女售货员毫不厌烦地一样一样地给他拿，并且对他说：“慢慢挑，莫着急，要买就买得合心意。”她说得这位顾客笑起来了。
    这位年青的女售货员名叫郑彩荣。她对顾客耐心而又热情。她的柜台前经常挤着一大群人，这个还没挑完，那个又来要货，而她不管有多忙，总是笑眯眯地说：“同志，请等等，我马上就来！”有不少在她手里买过布的人，第二次来了，常常是一进门就找她。无论顾客是否买了东西，她总是让顾客满意而去。
    什么力量使郑彩荣同志这样耐心、热情地对待顾客呢？
    郑彩荣小时候家里穷得连窝窝头都没得吃；她穿的衣服，都是用姐姐的旧衣裳改的。有一年，家里好不容易积了点钱，想给她做件海昌蓝大褂穿。她兴冲冲地跑到一家不小的布店门口。但是，她看到这个布店进进出出的都是穿呢军服的国民党军官和涂脂抹粉的太太小姐，她就不敢进去了。在那个时候，谁看得见她这个穷姑娘呢？她站在窗橱外看了又看，选了又选，直到完全选好了，方才走进店里去。她在店里站了半天，没有人理她。她看见掌柜的眼光几次从她身上溜过，但立刻就又忙着招呼那些老爷太太去了。直到顾客差不多都走了，掌柜的才慢慢地走过来，满脸不耐烦的样子，问她买什么。她没敢挑选，匆匆买了件海昌蓝大褂料，就跑出来了。她带着这件据说是“永不褪色”的衣料回到家里，用尺子一量，尺寸不够；下过一次水，缩了一大截；洗过没有几水，颜色就褪成一块蓝、一块白的了。她为这件“海昌蓝”大褂，难过了好多天。现在，她做了国营商店里的售货员，但那件使她伤心的事情，却从来没有忘记。她常常想：“工农群众的钱来得不容易，我不能让他们买不称心的东西。”她为顾客想得这么周到，比如，什么布下水以后会缩多少，她总是对顾客说得清清楚楚。
    有一天，郑彩荣正在紧张地工作着，一位解放军女同志走过来说：“同志，为什么第二商场卖暖水袋的同志的态度，和你们不一样？”郑彩荣一问，才知道这位女同志打算买一打小暖水袋，半打大暖水袋，但因售货员态度不好，气得没有买，她马上就说：“我和你一同去买。”顾客走了以后，她对那位售货员说：“同志，别忘了领导上给我们讲过的话，我们的工作对群众的生产、生活有很大的关系。她是个部队里的女同志，说不定生了病的解放军同志，正在床上等着用暖水袋呢！”从这以后，那位卖暖水袋的同志就改变了工作态度。
    郑彩荣开始学习卖布的时候，个别落后分子曾这样说：“笑话。从来也没见过女的卖布，男人学卖布，还要三年才能站柜台，十几岁的毛孩子兜得动布吗？”她听了这些话，也曾有点灰心。领导同志知道了，对她说：“你看过‘无脚飞将军’那个电影吗？你知道他为什么没有了脚还能开飞机？在新中国，只要自己努力，还有什么困难克服不了的？”郑彩荣想起小时候自己对门那家铺子里的学徒，每天天不亮就起来，站一天柜台，还得生火、作饭、倒痰盂，忙得连口开水都喝不上。而老板动不动还拳打脚踢。她又想起她到了公司以后，布匹组的组长每天早晨早起一个半小时，教她打算盘、兜布，晚上十点结完账，又教她练习量布、撕布的情形。她想：领导同志这样用心教导自己帮助自己为的是什么呀？从此以后，她学习更有劲了，不到三个月，就把解放以前要三年功夫才能学会的东西统统学会了。她现在不但会卖布，而且卖得比别人多。她经常超额完成自己的任务，还能帮助别人。郑彩荣说：“我每天站在柜台后边，看见前面的人一批一批挤出去，后面的人成群结队地挤进来，心里就有说不出的高兴。我的工作给他们增添了幸福和欢乐，为什么不高兴呢？”
