Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th TASS: The Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) continued in the Kremlin Palace on October 7th. Bulganin presided over the morning session. The agenda was to discuss the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and the report of the Central Auditing Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). Käbin (Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic) spoke first.

	Käbin said: Comrade Secretary Malenkov summarized the achievements of the Party's work since the Eighteenth Party Congress in the report of the Central Committee. What solemn and great achievements! The reason for these achievements is the wise leadership of Comrade Stalin, the leader and teacher of our Party. The Communist Party of Estonia is very honored that, since 1940, as a detachment of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, it has participated in this great construction effort.

	Käbin used Soviet Estonia as an example to illustrate the unparalleled superiority of socialism, which has liberated the source of the unfettered creativity of the masses. He spoke glowingly of the Party's great organizational role and the victory of Lenin-Stalin's national policy. With the fraternal help of the great Russian people and the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union, Soviet Estonia has been transformed in a very short period of time from an agricultural country with only a small-scale peasant economy and a vassal state of imperialist countries into a republic with highly developed industry and socialist agriculture.

	A strong gas and shale industry has been established.

	When Käbin spoke of the rapid progress in agricultural mechanization, he emphasized Stalin's extremely wise instruction that only the state can afford the expenses required to equip agriculture with first-class equipment, because collective farms cannot do so themselves. The collective farmers of Estonia are enthusiastically grateful to the Party and the Soviet government for re-equipping agriculture with new, modern machines.

	The Chairman then invited Beria to speak. The congress greeted this great Stalin's closest comrade-in-arms with stormy, sustained applause.

	Beria said: In the period between the Eighteenth Congress and the Nineteenth Congress, two things are particularly noteworthy in the life of our Party and the Soviet people. The first is the Great Patriotic War. The fate of our country and the fate of various countries and peoples in Europe and Asia were decided in that war. The Soviet Union defended its independence, thoroughly defeated the enemy, and thus saved mankind and human civilization. The Communist Party led by Comrade Stalin was the driving force and organizer of the Soviet people's great victory. Beria said to the thunderous applause of the delegates: In this critical period, Comrade Stalin commanded the Soviet state and its army. This is the great fortune of our Party and the peoples of the Soviet Union. The victory of the Soviet people showed the world that the power of our socialist country is indestructible.

	However, not everyone has understood the lessons of history. The American imperialists, fattened by two world wars and intoxicated by the delusion of establishing world hegemony, are again pushing the peoples of various countries into the abyss of world war, although, without a doubt, if they launch a war, it will only accelerate their collapse and demise. These words aroused stormy applause.

	Beria said: Another thing of the greatest significance in the life of the Party and the Soviet people is the new and massive upsurge in the national economy, which has enabled our industry to increase to 2.3 times the pre-war level. Industrial output in the past two years alone was 22 percent higher than the total industrial output during the first and second five-year plans.

	A large part of Beria's speech, which received great attention from the audience, discussed the historically unprecedented progress of various socialist nations, which is a clear proof of the victory of the Lenin-Stalin national policy implemented by our Party. These new socialist nations have fundamentally changed their faces in the Soviet era and have developed into progressive modern nations.

	Before the revolution, the industrial development of Central Asia was no different from that of neighboring countries such as Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan. Today, thirty-five years after the Great October Revolution, the electricity produced by Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, with a population of 17 million, is three times the total electricity of the Near East countries, with a population of 156 million.

	All of this clearly shows the world what achievements nations can achieve when they break away from imperialism and are liberated from the rule of landlords and capitalists.

	Beria then spoke of the great Russian people as the leading force of the Soviet Union.

	Beria concluded his speech with the following sentence:

	The people of all ethnic groups in our country can be confident that the Communist Party, armed with the theory of Marxism-Leninism and under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, will lead our country to our determined goal—communism.

	The delegates rose to their feet and responded to this sentence with enthusiastic cheers.

	Chernyshev (Kaliningrad) said: The years spent between the two congresses are truly another period of victory for the Communist Party's policy, a victory for the invincible ideas of Lenin and Stalin. Both industry and agriculture have exceeded pre-war levels, the economic strength of the Soviet land has been enhanced immeasurably, the international prestige of the Soviet Union has been raised, and a major step has been taken towards the road to communism.

	Chernyshev further described the great achievements of the working people of the young Kaliningrad Oblast. A huge socialist industry equipped with the latest Soviet machines has developed, and hundreds of factories have been restored, built, and constructed. Fundamental changes have taken place in agriculture. Huge collective farms, state farms, machine tractor stations, and land reclamation stations have been established.

	Chernyshev said: The bright dawn of peace and happiness shines brightly over our country, illuminating the path of the oppressed and exploited people of the world. Our people are advancing towards communism with full confidence. Leading our people to this goal is a great figure, whose iron will for victory and his inexhaustible energy inspire us to new victories. This person is the banner of the Party, this person is our beloved Stalin.

	After a short break, the congress reconvened under the chairmanship of Kaganovich. He invited Kiselev (Rostov-on-Don) to speak. Kiselev said: The Rostov Oblast, which suffered deeply under the temporary occupation of the German fascist bandits, has recovered in a short period of time and has greatly expanded its economy. In the past eight years, the government has invested billions of rubles in the economy of the Rostov Oblast. Hundreds of mines and enterprises have been restored and built. Kiselev painted a vivid picture of the implementation of Stalin's plan to transform nature.

	The fertile land in the Don River basin, irrigated by the Don River and protected by protective forest belts, will soon receive an unprecedented bumper harvest.

	Irrigation and water supply for dry land will help collective farms and state farms in the Rostov Oblast to additionally produce 40 million poods of wheat and many other products on the same area.

	Kiselev criticized the work of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture in constructing irrigation systems. In his conclusion, he also analyzed the shortcomings and errors in the work of the Party, Soviet, and economic organizations in the Rostov Oblast.

	Niyazov (Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic) said: Uzbekistan is the country's main supplier of cotton, silk, Persian lamb, and jute. The amount of cotton delivered to the state last year greatly increased compared to 1940. In the past three years alone, the income of collective farms has more than tripled. The republic currently has nearly two thousand collective farms with incomes of more than one million rubles.

	Niyazov said: However, the Party organization of the republic has not fully utilized the possibility of increasing cotton production. The harvest of some collective farms is still not high. In agriculture, the abundant machines are far from being fully utilized.

	Niyazov then spoke of the great significance of the initiative of collective farms and Party organizations in several states of Uzbekistan, which decided to open up tens of thousands of hectares of new land for agriculture with the help of the government using the public resources of collective farms.

	Niyazov criticized the Soviet Ministry of Cotton Planting and the Ministry of Agriculture for not providing enough assistance to the republic in further developing cotton planting.

	Gavrov (Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic) continued to speak, saying: The Party has completed a large amount of work in training communists with Marxism-Leninism and in educating the working people with communism. The ideals of Marxism-Leninism have grasped the hearts of the Soviet people and have generated great strength in their hearts to fight for communism. The decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and the instructions of Comrade Stalin have raised the level of all ideological work of the Party and have dealt crushing blows to nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and other manifestations of alien ideologies. The creative discussions on various issues of philosophy, biology, linguistics, and political economy have had a huge impact on the development of Soviet science. The recent publication of Comrade Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is a major event in the life of the Party and the people.

	Gavrov also pointed out: In the Tajik Republic, the Marxist-Leninist education of cadres has not yet reached the necessary level; there are major shortcomings in ideological work.

	When Gavrov talked about the great significance of literature, he said: So far, literature has not adequately reflected the heroic achievements of the Soviet people. Only a small number of monumental works on the key issues of our time have been created to date. Soviet cinema is also backward. Artists and filmmakers are arguing endlessly with writers, arguing about who among them should be blamed more for the backwardness of art and film. If the time spent on these arguments were used for creation, we could see many good plays in theaters and many good movies on the screen.

	Arutyunov (Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic) spoke, and when he talked about the economic progress of the Soviet Union, he emphasized: Industry is constantly developing not only in the central regions of the Soviet Union, but also in the remote states of the Soviet Union. Soviet Armenia is a clear example, where industry, agriculture, and culture are developing rapidly. For example, this year's total industrial output in Armenia is equivalent to four times the pre-war level in 1940.

	When Arutyunov mentioned the issue of ideological work, he pointed out: Stalin's doctrine on linguistics gave a new impetus to the development of Armenian national culture and opened up the prospect of further development of science and the national form and socialist content of literature and art. The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on ideological issues has armed the Armenian Party organization to fight against the manifestations of bourgeois nationalism and has facilitated the Marxist-Leninist training of cadres.

	Arutyunov talked about the work of Party organizations in large collective farms at the end of his speech.

	The delegates participating in the congress listened attentively to the report of the Credentials Committee. Committee Chairman Begov said: After reviewing the credentials of each delegate, the Credentials Committee confirmed that the election of all delegates to the congress fully complied with the decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on the proportion of delegates and the election procedures of delegates to the congress. The Party congresses and conferences in various places that elected delegates showed the Party's unbreakable unity. Begov said in applause: Our Party is united and grandly held this congress, and everyone is closely united around the Central Committee and around our great leader and teacher Comrade Stalin.

	A total of 1,192 delegates with voting rights and 167 delegates with the right to speak but without voting rights attended this congress. All delegates have attended the congress.

	Begov cited the figures on the large increase in Party members, which convincingly proved the strong appeal of the Party's banner and the Soviet people's infinite love and loyalty to the great Communist Party.

	The Party organizations of four new union republics (Latvia, Moldavia, Lithuania, and Estonia), the western states of Ukraine and Belarus, the young Kaliningrad Oblast, and southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands sent delegates to the congress for the first time.

	The report listed the figures on the increase in the number of Party grassroots organizations.

	There were representatives of 37 nationalities among the delegates, including Party cadres and government workers, and people engaged in socialist economic and cultural work. Attending the congress were leading figures in the field of science and engineering, advanced figures in industry and agriculture, engineers, agricultural experts, teachers, economists, doctors, and legal workers.

	The composition of the delegates shows that the Party organizations at all levels selected their best figures, the most active workers of the Party, those who had heroically fought for the freedom and independence of our motherland during the Patriotic War, and those who are now working selflessly to implement Stalin's great plan to build communism in the Soviet Union to participate in the Nineteenth Congress.

	The congress unanimously approved the report of the Credentials Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th TASS: The afternoon session of the Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on October 7th continued to discuss the reports of the Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks).

	Chairman Kaganovich invited Beryayev (Barnaul) to speak.

	Beryayev described the working people of the Altai Krai actively participating in the work of communist construction together with the entire Soviet people. He said: The Siberians fought heroically in the Patriotic War, dedicating all their energy, knowledge, and experience to consolidate the rear during the war, and now they have created brilliant achievements in peaceful construction labor.

	Beryayev continued: The draft directives of the Fifth Five-Year Plan mentioned the preparation work for the construction of irrigation systems to divert water to irrigate the Kulunda Steppe. After the completion of this task, it will fundamentally change the agriculture of the Altai Krai and its adjacent areas, increase grain yields, and create favorable conditions for developing animal husbandry and improving its productivity.

	Plass (Molotov City) spoke, describing the close connection between the Party and the people. He said: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has convened its Nineteenth Congress in an atmosphere loved by the entire people. The men and women of the Soviet Union have always unhesitatingly entrusted their fate to the Party of Lenin and Stalin, and under its leadership are advancing towards the peak of human happiness—communism.

	When Plass described the brilliant achievements of the national industrialization policy, he cited the western Urals as an example, where the main departments of heavy industry are constantly developing. He said: The working people of the Urals call their prosperous area Stalin Urals with sincere respect and gratitude. The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates that the Kama Hydropower Station in this area will generate electricity, and the construction of another huge hydropower station—the Votkinsk Hydropower Station on the Kama River—will begin. However, even then, only 15 percent of the water resources in the western Urals will be utilized. Plass pointed out: It is very convenient to build large and medium-sized hydropower stations on the rivers of the Molotov Oblast. He also talked about the work of the timber industry and some other economic issues.

	Yegorov (Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic) said in his speech: Since the Eighteenth Party Congress, the relationship between the Soviet people and the Bolshevik Party has become closer. The socialist consciousness of hundreds of millions of working people has been significantly improved, which is vividly reflected in the unprecedented political activity of the people and the high tide of labor enthusiasm.

	The Karelo-Finnish Republic is growing and strengthening in the fraternal big family of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. Not a trace of the former Russian border forest area remains in Karelia. The timber industry equipped with new machines has developed on a large scale, supplying the country with millions of cubic meters of timber every year. The republic's paper production is now almost three times the pre-war level in 1940. The amount of fish caught is constantly increasing, and the public enterprises of collective farms are developing. The republic has made significant progress in culture with national forms and socialist content. The Communist Party of the republic feels the concern and attention of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and Stalin himself in its activities every day.

	Yegorov pointed out that some departments have not provided sufficient assistance to the development of some important parts of the republic's economy.

	Ignatov (Krasnodar) spoke, citing examples from the life of Soviet Kuban to show the great victories the Party has achieved in communist construction. He pointed out: Usually the Kuban area is not only one of the largest granaries in the country, but also an important industrial center. In recent years, investments in industrial development in this area have reached several billion rubles. Kuban supplies the country with machine tools, precision instruments, oil, cement, and canned food. The construction of a fine wool factory, a cotton textile factory, and other factories has now begun.

	Due to the impartial implementation of the Party's policy in the development of collective farms, agriculture has achieved new achievements. Due to the merger of collective farms, it is possible to use excellent machines more effectively, which has significantly increased yields.

	The collective farms and state farms in the Kuban area are paying more and more agricultural products to the state every year. For example, this year Kuban paid the state 23 million poods more wheat than in 1940 before the war. Agricultural mechanization is expanding. Plowing has been fully mechanized, and 99 percent of the work of harvesting cereal grains and sunflowers has been mechanized, etc. The Party organization has trained excellent machine operators and greatly improved the cultural and technical level of collective farmers.

	Ignatov raised the issue of using local water resources for irrigation and power generation. He said in the end: The communists of the Krasnodar Krai will unite the working people of Kuban to implement the tasks stipulated by the Nineteenth Party Congress, and under the leadership of the Central Committee and under the guidance of Comrade Stalin, they will surely gloriously complete the tasks assigned to them.

	Korneichuk (Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic) began his speech by praising the heroic achievements made by the multi-ethnic Soviet people under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Lenin-Stalin Party. He said: The hearts of men and women are burning with infinite love and sincere gratitude for the inspirer of all historical victories, their beloved father and teacher, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.

	Korneichuk emphasized: One of the greatest victories of our Party is that the Soviet people, nurtured by the great ideals of Lenin and Stalin, have become mentors to people in countries around the world on how to arrange their lives. The people of all ethnic groups in the great ancient country of China deeply respect the Soviet people as their elder brother.

	Korneichuk said: The Russian people have been giving fraternal assistance to Ukraine for hundreds of years.

	Korneichuk spoke of the development of Soviet Ukraine in all aspects and contrasted this phenomenon of prosperity with the hard lives of workers in capitalist countries dominated by the law of the jungle.

	He advocated taking a vigilant and uncompromising attitude towards any manifestation of bourgeois nationalism.

	In the last part of his speech, Korneichuk critically analyzed the activities of Soviet writers and assured the congress that writers, artists, and composers, all those engaged in artistic work who have created works that are highly admired and loved by the entire Soviet people, will surely do their best to delight the Soviet motherland with new masterpieces inspired by the genius of the great friend of Soviet literature and art, Comrade Stalin.

	The congress adjourned after Korneichuk's speech. Delegates and guests took a short break and returned to the conference hall.

	As Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin and his loyal comrades took their seats on the podium, all the delegates stood up, and a storm of cheers echoed through the Kremlin. The entire venue cheered: "Long live Comrade Stalin! Stalin Comrade, hooray!"

	Chairman Kaganovich invited Razzakov (Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic) to speak. He spoke of the great achievements made by all national republics and all socialist nations. Due to the unbreakable friendship of the people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union and the implementation of the Lenin-Stalin national policy, the Kyrgyz people have made unprecedented progress. They made a revolutionary leap from feudalism to socialism, avoiding the stage of capitalist development. Razzakov cited many notable facts to prove the great achievements of the republic in various departments of the national economy, its culture, science, and art. He said: According to the new Five-Year Plan, Soviet Kyrgyzstan will have greater development.

	Razzakov also talked about many shortcomings in the republic's agricultural leadership. He criticized several ministries, especially the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, because the ministry's leading cadres rarely studied the situation on the ground and did not provide the republic with practical assistance to solve specific problems.

	The next speaker was the Minister of the Soviet Army, Marshal of the Soviet Union Vasilevsky, who was warmly welcomed by the congress.

	Marshal Vasilevsky said: The soldiers, sergeants, officers, and generals of the Soviet Army all realize that they are one with the entire people. The communists in the army and all active-duty soldiers of the Soviet Army are greeting the Nineteenth Party Congress with new achievements in combat drills and political training. They have never been as united as they are now around their beloved leader and great commander, Stalin.

	When Marshal Vasilevsky talked about the international situation, he pointed out: The Soviet Union is leading the peace camp and firmly pursuing a peaceful foreign policy. However, the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy does not mean its military weakness.

	Vasilevsky said: The comprehensive new plan for the peaceful development of the Soviet Union formulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan once again shows the world the infinite vitality of socialism and the great superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system. The Soviet Army is vigilantly guarding the historical fruits of our people, guarding their outstanding present and their more magnificent and beautiful future.

	Marshal Vasilevsky said at the end of his speech: The situation of the Soviet Army's combat drills and combat training, its mobilization preparedness, and its combat preparedness make us fully qualified to assure the Party, the government, and Comrade Stalin himself that the Soviet Army will surely fulfill its task to protect the constructive labor of the Soviet people and to defend the national interests of the Soviet Union.

	Kaganovich announced: The Presidium of the Congress received a proposal to end the discussion on the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). The delegates unanimously passed this motion.

	Malenkov does not intend to make a speech in response to the discussion.

	The congress then proceeded to adopt a resolution. A delegate from the Moscow Party organization, Gapitonov, put forward the following resolution on the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks):

	The Nineteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), having listened to and discussed the report of Comrade Malenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), on the work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), hereby resolves: to approve the political line and practical work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks).

	This resolution was unanimously adopted in a storm of sustained cheers. All the delegates stood up, and the entire venue cheered: "Long live Comrade Stalin! Glory to the great Stalin!"

	Kaganovich announced: Guests from various countries—delegations from the Communist Party and other fraternal workers' parties—attended the Nineteenth Party Congress.

	Bierut, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a congratulatory message to the congress on behalf of the Polish United Workers' Party, and he was warmly welcomed by the congress. Bierut praised the great role and significance of the historical victories that the Soviet Union has achieved and is achieving under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and the wise leader—the great Stalin—for the fate of all progressive humanity, and he spoke of the solemn greatness of the current era (which he called the Stalin era). He conveyed the congratulations of the Polish working people to the congress. The Polish working people expressed deep gratitude to the Soviet people and their party for being liberated from fascist slavery, for regaining national independence, and for the selfless and warm assistance that the Soviet Union has given to the Polish people in the post-war years. Bierut said: The Polish United Workers' Party draws ideological strength from the great treasure house of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks).

	After Bierut's speech, the meeting adjourned. The next meeting will be held on October 8th.

    苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会第三日会议
    通过关于联共中央委员会报告的决议
    批准联共中央委员会的政治路线和实际工作
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科八日电：苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会于十月七日在克里姆林宫大厅继续举行。布尔加宁主持上午会议。议程是讨论苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会的报告和苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央检查委员会的报告。开宾（爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国）首先发言。
    开宾说：中央委员会书记马林科夫同志在中央委员会的报告中已总结了自从第十八次党代表大会以来党的工作成绩。庄严伟大的成绩啊！其所以获得了这些成绩，是我党的领袖和导师斯大林同志的英明领导的结果。爱沙尼亚的共产党非常荣幸，自从一九四○年以来，它作为伟大的苏联共产党的一个支队，参加着这种伟大建设的努力。
    开宾以苏维埃爱沙尼亚为例，来阐明社会主义的无比的优越性，社会主义已把那没有解放过的群众创造力的泉源解放出来了。他畅谈党的伟大组织作用，以及列宁—斯大林民族政策的胜利。苏维埃爱沙尼亚凭借伟大的俄罗斯人民和苏联各族人民的兄弟般的帮助，在很短的时期中，已从一个只有小农经济的农业国、从帝国主义国家的附庸国一变而为拥有高度发展的工业与社会主义农业的共和国了。
    一种强大的煤气与页岩工业已经创办起来。
    开宾说到农业机械化方面的迅速进步时，强调指出斯大林的极为英明的指示，指示说：唯有国家才能负担用头等设备来装备农业所需的费用，因为集体农场自己是不能够这么办的。爱沙尼亚的集体农场农民热忱感激党和苏维埃政府用新的现代机器把农业重新装备起来。
    主席接着请贝利亚发言。大会以暴风雨般的、经久不绝的鼓掌欢迎这位伟大的斯大林的最亲密的战友之一。
    贝利亚说：在第十八次代表大会和第十九次代表大会之间的这段时期中，我们的党和苏联人民的生活中有两件事情是特别显著的。第一件是伟大的爱国战争。我国的命运以及欧洲和亚洲各个国家和各国人民的命运都在那次战争中被决定了。苏联维护了它的独立，它彻底地打垮了敌人，从而也挽救了人类和人类的文明。斯大林同志所领导的共产党乃是苏联人民伟大胜利的原动力和组织者。贝利亚在代表们雷动的掌声中说：在这个危急时期，有斯大林同志指挥苏维埃国家和它的军队。这乃是我们的党、苏联各族人民极大的幸运。苏联人民的胜利向全世界表明了，我们社会主义国家的威力是不可摧毁的。
    然而，并不是所有的人都领会历史的教训。靠两次世界大战养肥了的并且被建立世界霸权的妄想所陶醉了的美帝国主义者，又在把各国人民推到世界战争的深渊里面去，虽然，毫无疑问，他们若是发动战争的话就只有加速他们的崩溃与灭亡。这几句话引起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    贝利亚说：党和苏联人民生活中的另一件具有最伟大意义的事情乃是国民经济新的、声势浩大的高涨，这种高涨已经使我国工业的水平可以提高到战前的二点三倍。过去两年的工业产量就比第一个和第二个五年计划期间的工业总产量多百分之二十二。
    贝利亚受到听众极大注意的演说中，有一大部分谈论到各社会主义的民族在历史上空前的进步，这种进步乃是我们的党所实行的列宁—斯大林民族政策之胜利的明证。这些新的社会主义的民族在苏维埃时代已经根本改变了它们的面目并已发展为进步的现代的民族。
    在革命以前，中亚细亚的工业发展跟土耳其、伊朗、阿富汗等邻国并没有什么差别。今天，在伟大十月革命三十五年以后，拥有一千七百万人口的哈萨克、乌兹别克、吉尔吉斯、塔吉克和土库曼所生产的电力，已相当于拥有一亿五千六百万人口的各个近东国家电力总和的三倍。
    所有这些向全世界清楚地表明：和帝国主义断绝了关系，并且从地主及资本家统治下解放出来的民族，能够获得一些什么成就。
    贝利亚接着说到伟大的俄罗斯人民是苏联的领导力量。
    贝利亚用下面的一句话结束了他的演说：
    我国各族人民可以相信：用马克思—列宁主义的理论武装着的、在斯大林同志领导之下的共产党一定会把我们的国家领到我们认定的目标——共产主义。
    代表们全体起立，对这句话报以热烈的欢呼。
    契尔尼雪夫（加里宁格勒）说：在两次代表大会之间所度过的这些年，真正是共产党政策又一胜利的时期，这是战无不胜的列宁和斯大林的思想的胜利。工业和农业都已超过战前的水平，苏维埃国土的经济实力已经无比地增强，苏联的国际威望已经提高，并且向共产主义道路上迈进了一大步。
    契尔尼雪夫进一步叙述年轻的加里宁格勒州的劳动人民所获得的巨大成就。以苏联最新式机器装备起来的巨大的社会主义工业已经发展，数以百计的工厂已经恢复、修建和建筑起来。农业上已经起了根本的变化。庞大的集体农场、国家农场、机器拖拉机站和土地开垦站已经设立。
    契尔尼雪夫说：和平与幸福的灿烂的曙光在我国上空放出万丈光芒，照耀着全世界被压迫被剥削的人民的道路。我国人民正在满怀信心地向共产主义前进。领导我国人民到达这一目标的，是一位伟大的人物，他对胜利的钢铁般的意志和他的无穷尽的精力鼓舞着我们到达新的胜利，这一个人是党的旗帜，这一个人便是我们的亲爱的斯大林。
    在短时间的休息以后，大会在卡冈诺维奇主持下重新开会。他请基塞列夫（顿河罗斯多夫）发言。基塞列夫说：在德国法西斯匪帮暂时占领下受过深重灾难的罗斯多夫州，在短短的时期中已经恢复过来，并且已把它的经济大大地扩充了。在过去八年中，政府在罗斯多夫州的经济方面，投资达几十亿卢布。成百的矿场和企业已经恢复和建造起来。基塞列夫把实现斯大林改造自然计划的一幅生动的画面描绘了出来。
    为顿河的水所灌溉并为防护林带所保护的顿河流域的肥沃的土地，不久将要得到空前的丰收。
    干燥土地的灌溉和供水，将帮助罗斯多夫州的集体农场和国家农场在同样面积上额外增产四千万普特小麦和许多其他产品。
    基塞列夫批评了苏联农业部在修建灌溉系统方面的工作。他在结语中并分析了罗斯多夫州的党、苏维埃和经济组织的工作中所存在的缺点和发生的错误。
    尼雅佐夫（乌兹别克苏维埃社会主义共和国）说：乌兹别克是全国棉、丝、波斯羔羊和黄麻的主要供应者。去年交给国家的棉花较一九四○年大大增加。单在最近三年，集体农场的收入就增加到三倍以上。共和国现有将近两千个集体农场的收入在一百万卢布以上。
    尼雅佐夫说：然而，共和国的党组织并没有充分利用增加棉产量的可能性。有些集体农场收成依然不高。在农业方面，远没有充分利用丰富的机器。
    尼雅佐夫接着说到乌兹别克若干州的集体农场及党组织的倡议的重大意义，这些农场和党组织决定借政府的帮助用集体农场的公共资源为农业开辟几万公顷新土地。
    尼雅佐夫批评了苏联植棉部和农业部对该共和国进一步发展植棉工作所给予的帮助不够。
    加伏罗夫（塔吉克苏维埃社会主义共和国）继起发言说：党在使共产党员受到马克思—列宁主义锻炼方面，在使劳动人民受到共产主义教育方面，已完成了大量工作。马克思—列宁主义的理想已经掌握住苏联人民的心灵，已经在他们的心中产生了为共产主义而斗争的伟大力量。苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会的决定和斯大林同志的指示，已提高了党的一切思想工作的水平，已经使民族主义、世界主义以及异己思想的其他表现受到了粉碎性的打击。关于哲学、生物学、语言学和政治经济学各种问题的创造性的讨论，已对苏维埃科学的发展有了巨大的影响。最近斯大林同志的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”的出版，是党和人民生活中的一件大事。
    加伏罗夫同时指出：在塔吉克共和国，干部们所受马克思—列宁主义教育还没有达到必要的水平；在思想工作方面存在着重大的缺点。
    加伏罗夫谈到文学的伟大意义时说：到目前为止，文学反映苏联人民的英雄伟业还很不充分。迄今只创作了少量以我们时代的关键问题为主题的纪念碑式的作品。苏联电影也是落后的。艺术与电影工作者们跟作家们争论不休，争论他们中间究竟谁对于艺术与电影的落后应受到更多的责备。如果把花费在这些争论上的时间用来从事创作，我们就可以在剧院中看到许多好戏，在银幕上可以看到许多好影片了。
    阿鲁提诺夫（亚美尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国）发言，他说到苏联的经济进步时，强调指出：不仅在苏联的中央地区，而且在苏联的边远州区，工业都在不断发展。苏维埃亚美尼亚便是一个明显的例证，那儿的工业、农业和文化都在迅速发展着。例如，今年亚美尼亚工业总产量就相当于战前一九四○年的四倍。
    阿鲁提诺夫提到思想工作问题时指出：斯大林关于语言学的学说给予亚美尼亚民族文化的发展一种新的推动力，并且展开了科学以及民族形式与社会主义内容的文学和艺术更进一步发展的前途。苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会关于思想问题的决定，已把亚美尼亚的党组织武装起来为反对资产阶级民族主义的表现而斗争，已使干部受马克思—列宁主义的训练感到了便利。
    阿鲁提诺夫在结束他的发言时谈到了大集体农场中的党组织的工作。
    参与代表大会的代表们聚精会神地听取了资格审查委员会的报告。委员会主席别哥夫说：资格审查委员会审查了每一位代表的证书之后证实：代表大会所有代表的选举完全符合苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会关于代表比例和代表大会代表的选举程序的决定。各地选出代表的那些党代表会议与代表大会表明了党的牢不可破的团结。别哥夫在掌声中说：我们的党团结一致而且声势浩大地举行这次代表大会，大家紧密地团结在中央委员会的周围，团结在我们伟大的领袖和导师斯大林同志的周围。
    这次代表大会共有具有表决权的代表一千一百九十二人，具有发言权但无表决权的代表一百六十七人。所有代表都已出席代表大会。
    别哥夫援引了关于党员大量增加的数字，这些数字令人信服地证明了党的旗帜的强大的吸引力，证明了苏联各族人民对于伟大共产党无限的爱戴与忠诚。
    四个新的加盟共和国（拉脱维亚、摩尔达维亚、立陶宛和爱沙尼亚），乌克兰与白俄罗斯西部各州，年轻的加里宁格勒州，库页岛南部和千岛群岛的党组织第一次派代表出席代表大会。
    报告中列举了关于党的基层组织数目增加的数字。
    代表当中有三十七个民族的代表，有党的干部和政府工作人员，有从事社会主义经济与文化工作的人。出席代表大会的有著名的科学与工程界的领袖，有工业和农业方面的先进人物，有工程师、农业专家、教师、经济学家、医生和法律工作者。
    代表的成分表明各个党组织把它们最优秀的人物，党的最积极的工作者，那些曾在爱国战争期间为我们祖国的自由与独立而英勇战斗过，并且正在为执行斯大林的在苏联建设共产主义的伟大计划而忘我工作的人们选了出来参加第十九次代表大会。
    大会一致通过了资格审查委员会的报告。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科八日电：苏联共产党
    （布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会十月七日下午会议，继续讨论苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会和中央检查委员会的报告。
    主席卡冈诺维奇请柏里雅耶夫（巴尔瑙尔）发言。
    柏里雅耶夫叙述阿尔泰边疆区的劳动人民和苏联全体人民一同积极参加共产主义建设的工作。他说：西伯利亚人在卫国战争中英勇作战，在战时献出他们所有的精力、知识和经验以巩固后方，现今在和平建设劳动中又创造了辉煌的业绩。
    柏里雅耶夫接着说：第五个五年计划指示草案说到进行建设灌溉系统以引水灌溉古仑达草原的准备工作。这一项任务完成以后，将使阿尔泰边疆区及其毗连区域的农业发生根本的变化，将要增加谷物的收获量，为发展牲畜饲养业及提高它的生产力创造有利的条件。
    普拉斯（莫洛托夫市）发言，叙述党和人民的密切的联系。他说：苏联共产党已经在全体人民热爱的氛围中召开它的第十九次代表大会了。苏联的男女们始终毫不踌躇地把他们的命运托付给列宁和斯大林的党，在它的领导下向着人类幸福的高峰——共产主义——前进。
    普拉斯叙述国家工业化政策的辉煌成就时举出乌拉尔西部作为一个例子，那里重工业的主要部门正在不断发展中。他说：乌拉尔的劳动人民怀着衷心的敬重和感激把他们的繁盛的地区称作斯大林乌拉尔。第五个五年计划规定使这个区域的卡马水电站发电，并开始建筑另一个巨大的水力发电站——卡马河上的沃特金斯克水电站。然而即使到了那时，乌拉尔西部的水力资源也只被利用到百分之十五的程度。普拉斯指出：在莫洛托夫州的河流上建筑巨型的和中型的水电站都是很便利的。他并且谈到木材工业的工作和其他一些经济问题。
    叶哥罗夫（卡累利阿—芬兰苏维埃社会主义共和国）在他的发言中说：自从第十八次党代表大会以来，苏联人民和布尔什维克党的关系更密切了。亿万劳动人民的社会主义意识已经显著地提高，这从人民的空前的政治积极性上和劳动热情的高涨上极其生动地反映了出来。
    卡累利阿——芬兰共和国在苏联各族人民的兄弟般的大家庭内正在成长和壮大中。作为过去俄国边僻森林地带的那种标志，在卡累利阿并没有留下丝毫的痕迹。配备新式机器的木材工业已经大规模发展，它每年供给国家数百万立方公尺的木材。共和国纸张的产量现在差不多相当于战前一九四零年的三倍。捕鱼量不断增加，集体农场的公有企业正在发展。共和国在民族形式和社会主义内容的文化上已有显著的进步。共和国的共产党在它的活动上每天感觉到苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会和斯大林亲身的关怀与注意。
    叶哥罗夫指出若干部门对共和国经济中一些重要部分的发展并没有予以充分的帮助。
    伊格纳托夫（克拉斯诺达）发言，他从苏维埃库班的生活中举出例子，表明党在共产主义建设上所获得的伟大胜利。他指出：通常库班区域不但是全国最大的谷仓之一，而且也是一个重要的工业中心。最近几年，在这一区域在工业发展方面的投资已达几十亿卢布。库班供给全国工作母机、精密仪器、石油、水泥和罐头食物。现已开始建筑一所细羊毛工厂，一所棉织品工厂和其他工厂。
    由于在集体农场发展上不偏不倚地执行了党的政策，农业已经得到了新的成就。由于集体农场的合并，因而有可能更有效地使用上等的机器，使收获量有显著的增加。
    库班区域的集体农场和国家农场向国家缴纳的农产品每年都在增加。例如，今年库班向国家缴纳的小麦，较战前一九四零年多二千三百万普特。农业机械化正在扩充中。耕种都已充分机械化，收割带穗的谷物及向日葵的工作有百分之九十九已机械化等等。党组织已经训练出优秀的机器操纵者干部，大量提高了集体农民的文化和技术水平。
    伊格纳托夫提出利用地方水力资源从事灌溉和发电的问题。他在最后说：克拉斯诺达边疆区的共产党员们将团结库班的劳动人民执行第十九次党代表大会所规定的任务，在中央委员会领导下，在斯大林同志指导下，一定会光荣地完成交与他们的任务。
    考涅楚克（乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国）的演说首先赞扬多民族的苏联人民在列宁—斯大林党中央委员会领导之下作出的英勇的业绩。他说：男男女女的心灵中燃烧着对一切历史性胜利的鼓舞者、他们亲爱的父亲和导师约·维·斯大林的无限热爱与诚挚的感激。
    考涅楚克强调指出：我们的党最伟大的胜利之一是，受列宁与斯大林的伟大理想培养出来的苏联人民，在世界各国人民看来，已经成为指导他们如何安排生活的导师。伟大的古国——中国的各族人民怀着深深的敬爱把苏联人民称为他们的老大哥。
    考涅楚克说：俄罗斯人民几百年来一直给予乌克兰兄弟般的援助。
    考涅楚克说到苏维埃乌克兰各方面的发展，并且拿这种繁荣的现象跟那受资本主义弱肉强食法则支配的资本主义国家劳动者们艰苦的生活作了对照。
    他主张对资产阶级民族主义的丝毫表现都要采取警惕与不妥协的态度。
    考涅楚克在他演说的最后一部分用批判的态度分析了苏联作家的活动，并且向大会保证：作家、艺术家和作曲家，凡是曾经创作过一些受到全体苏联人民非常推崇与喜爱的作品的从事艺术工作的人们，一定尽力用他们受了苏维埃文学与艺术的伟大朋友斯大林同志天才思想的启发而创作出来的新的杰作使苏维埃祖国感到喜悦。
    代表大会在考涅楚克演说之后宣布休会。代表与来宾们略事休息后又回到会议厅中就座。
    当约·维·斯大林和他的忠诚的战友们在主席台上就座时，全体代表起立，暴风雨般的欢呼声响彻了克里姆林宫。全场欢呼：“斯大林同志万岁！斯大林同志，乌拉！”
    主席卡冈诺维奇请拉柴柯夫（吉尔吉斯苏维埃社会主义共和国）发言。他说到所有民族共和国、所有社会主义民族获得的伟大成就。由于苏联各族人民牢不可破的友谊，由于列宁—斯大林民族政策的贯彻实施，吉尔吉斯人民获得了空前的进步。他们从封建制度向社会主义作了革命的飞跃，避免了资本主义的发展阶段。拉柴柯夫援引了许多显著的事实，证明共和国国民经济各部门，它的文化、科学与艺术方面的伟大成就。他说：根据新五年计划，苏维埃吉尔吉斯将有更大的发展。
    拉柴柯夫同时谈到了共和国农业领导方面的许多缺点。他批评了几个部，尤其是苏联农业部，因为该部的领导干部很少实地研究情况而且也没有给予该共和国以实际的帮助来解决具体的问题。
    接着发言的是苏联陆军部长、苏联元帅华西列夫斯基，他受到大会的热烈欢迎。
    华西列夫斯基元帅说：苏军的战士、士官、军官和将军们都体会到他们与全体人民是一体的。军队中的共产党员和一切苏军现役将士都以战斗操练和政治训练中的新成就来迎接第十九次党代表大会，他们从来不曾像现在这样团结在热烈爱戴的领袖和伟大统帅斯大林的周围。
    华西列夫斯基元帅说到国际形势时指出：苏联领导着和平阵营，坚定地推行着爱好和平的外交政策。然而，苏联爱好和平的外交政策决不是意味着它的军事上的软弱。
    华西列夫斯基说：在第五个五年计划中拟定的关于苏联和平发展的包罗一切的新方案，再度对全世界显示出社会主义的无限活力，显示出社会主义经济制度对于资本主义经济制度的伟大优越性。苏军警觉地守护着我国人民的历史性的果实，守护着他们的卓越的现在以及更加庄严美好的将来。
    华西列夫斯基元帅在发言的末尾说：苏军的战斗操练和作战训练的情况，及其动员准备和战斗准备，使我们有十足的资格对党、对政府、对斯大林同志本人提出保证：苏军必将光荣履行任务以保护苏联人民的建设性的劳动，以保卫苏联的国家利益。
    卡冈诺维奇宣布：大会主席团接到一项建议，就是建议把关于苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会的报告的讨论告一结束。代表们一致通过这项动议。
    马林科夫不拟发表关于答复讨论的演说。
    大会接着就要通过一项决议。莫斯科党组织的一个代表加皮托诺夫提出了关于苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会的报告的决议如下：
    联共（布）第十九次代表大会，听取并且讨论了联共（布）中央委员会书记马林科夫同志关于联共（布）中央委员会的工作报告之后，兹特决议：批准苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会的政治路线和实际工作。
    这个决议在暴风雨似的经久不息的欢呼声中一致通过。全体代表起立，大厅中全场欢呼：“斯大林同志万岁！光荣归伟大的斯大林！”
    卡冈诺维奇宣布：各国来宾——共产党和其他兄弟工人党的代表团列席了第十九次党代表大会。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席贝鲁特，代表波兰统一工人党向大会致贺词，他受到大会的热烈欢迎。贝鲁特盛赞苏联在苏联共产党（布尔什维克）和英明领袖——伟大斯大林的领导下所已经取得的和正在取得的历史性的胜利对于一切进步人类的命运的伟大作用与意义，他说到目前时代（他称之为斯大林时代）的庄严伟大。他传达波兰劳动人民对大会的祝贺。因为从法西斯奴役下获得解放，因为恢复了民族独立，并且因为苏联在战后年代中给予波兰人民的那种毫无私心的亲切援助，波兰劳动人民对苏联人民和他们的政党表示深切的感激。贝鲁特说：波兰统一工人党从苏联共产党（布尔什维克）的伟大宝库中吸取到思想力量。
    贝鲁特演说后，会议散会。下次会议将于十月八日举行。
