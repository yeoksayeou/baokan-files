    The Struggle of the Malayan People for National Independence and Peace
    Malayan Representative to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference Zeng Xuehong
    Currently, the Malayan people are engaged in a persistent struggle for national independence and peace.
    The Malayan people love freedom and peace and have a glorious tradition of striving for independence and defending peace. Since the British invaders intruded into Malaya in 1786, the Malayan people have continuously launched resolute struggles against British colonial rule and for national liberation and independence. From 1941 to 1945, during the "dark days" when Japanese militarists occupied Malaya and implemented extremely cruel and bloody rule, the British army fled in disarray. The Malayan people, without fear, used their united strength to bravely wage an anti-Japanese guerrilla war and finally, with the support of the people of all countries, defeated the Japanese invaders and achieved victory. The great victory of the Malayan people's anti-Japanese war proved their determination to fight for national independence and peace and also proved that they have sufficient strength to defeat the enemy in order to win independence and defend peace.
    After Japan's surrender, what the Malayan people wholeheartedly hoped for was to quickly heal the wounds of war and build a peaceful, free, and beautiful life. However, the British imperialists, disregarding this good wish of the Malayan people, brutally suppressed the Malayan people's post-war democratic demands and continued and intensified their colonial enslavement system in Malaya. In less than half a year after the end of the war, the hideous face of British imperialism's increasingly cruel rule over the Malayan people was fully exposed. In December 1945, the British forcibly disbanded the "Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army," which had contributed to the anti-Japanese struggle, and successively arrested anti-Japanese elements and their leaders. At the same time, the British announced the restoration of all its reactionary laws from before the war, including the "Expulsion Ordinance" and the "Sedition Ordinance," etc. In February 1946, Lord Mountbatten, the former Supreme Allied Commander Southeast Asia, openly dispatched a large number of military police and secret agents to bloodily massacre the masses participating in the "Singapore Fall Commemoration Meeting," creating the famous "February 15th Massacre." The Malayan people, who had been tempered and awakened by the anti-Japanese war, could absolutely not tolerate this oppression by the British colonial authorities. Therefore, they rose up to struggle and launched a vigorous democratic movement. The post-war Malayan people's democratic movement was very high. For example, in January 1946, the 190,000-worker general strike in Singapore, protesting the British authorities' unreasonable arrest of worker leaders, was responded to by a market strike by 90% of the business community throughout Malaya, paralyzing transportation and public institutions throughout the country. Another example is the general strike of all sectors of Malaya in October 1947 against the British "Malayan New Political System" plan, which also greatly hit the British imperialist colonial policy.
    In June 1948, in order to further suppress the Malayan people's independence movement, the British colonial authorities launched a full-scale military offensive against the Malayan people. For more than four years, with the support of American imperialism, Britain dispatched nearly 400,000 soldiers, police, and various new types of aircraft and artillery, and even repeatedly violated international law, using large amounts of poison gas and chemical weapons, etc., massively bombing civilian houses and destroying crops, and cruelly slaughtering vast numbers of peaceful residents. Up to now, the British colonial authorities have detained and deported more than 30,000 innocent people, including a large number of women, children, and the elderly, all of whom have been subjected to insults, torture, and other kinds of torture by the British military police (the number of penalties reaching more than 70 kinds). In rural areas, more than 400,000 farmers and a large number of workers have been driven out of their fields and work areas and concentrated in more than 400 "New Villages," where they are closely monitored by British military police and secret agents, completely losing their freedom, and many are even deprived of the right to work. In addition, Britain has implemented measures such as "collective punishment" in an attempt to coerce the Malayan people to submit to its violent rule. However, Britain's thorough fascist reign of terror in Malaya precisely exposed its great fear of the democratic forces of the Malayan people.
    However, the heroic Malayan people have not been intimidated or subdued by the British bloody suppression; on the contrary, they have waged a resolute struggle to realize the lofty ideal of national independence. The outstanding sons and daughters of all ethnic groups in Malaya formed the Malayan National Liberation Army, repeatedly smashing the barbaric attacks of the British invading army, and developing from the initial nine detachments to the present twelve detachments. Under the resolute attack of the Malayan people, the British imperialists' arrogant dream of "quelling the war within fifteen months," which was boasted of when the war was launched in June 1948, the so-called "Anti-Bandit Month" offensive launched in early 1950, and the anti-people military plan implemented from 1950 to 1951—the "Briggs Plan," etc.—have all failed shamefully. The personnel responsible for implementing these bloody plans, such as former Malayan Army Commander-in-Chief Major General Boucher and former Malayan Federation Operations Commander Lieutenant General Briggs, have also been dismissed.
    In the struggle, the Malayan people, regardless of the British military police's slaughter and at the risk of their lives, supplied the guerrillas with grain and other items, resolutely resisted the British colonial authorities' large-scale forced relocation plan, as well as its "grain control" and barbaric "collective punishment" measures. The heroic struggle of the broad Malayan youth against conscription has severely hit the Malayan British colonial authorities' conspiracy to expand the army. Therefore, its first large-scale forced conscription plan was shamefully defeated after only completing 15 percent. For more than four years, the Malayan people have shed blood and sacrificed for the just cause of national independence, advancing wave upon wave, and their moving heroic deeds are too numerous to mention.
    The rule of the British colonialists has not only deprived the Malayan people of their right to independence but also devastated their peaceful lives. It is well known that Malaya's rubber and tin production is very rich, ranking first in the world. However, the rubber and tin produced by the Malayan people through hard work every year are all plundered by Britain. In 1951, Britain earned a net profit of more than 400 million US dollars from the Malayan people, an increase of about one-sixth compared to 1950; British-capital rubber and tin companies thus obtained an average dividend of 40 to 50 percent, with the highest reaching 150 percent. On the other hand, the lives of the Malayan people have deteriorated sharply. For example, the cost of living index increased by 70 percent compared to the previous year, and in Singapore alone, the total number of unemployed people reached 15 percent of the total number of workers. Not only that, but the Malayan people are also forced to bear the huge war costs of the colonial war waged by Britain in Malaya, which amounted to more than 300 million US dollars in 1952, an average of about 50 US dollars per person, equivalent to 20 months of living expenses for one person. The heavy exploitation of the British colonial authorities has completely destroyed the peaceful and happy life of the Malayan people.
    The adventurous war of aggression waged by the United States in Korea, as well as its frantic war preparations policy, have caused even deeper disasters for the Malayan people. Recently, Malaya has experienced a severe economic crisis: rubber prices have plummeted by two-thirds, and rubber production has shrunk by two-fifths; large numbers of workers are unemployed, and the wages of employed workers have also been cut by 10 to 50 percent; the people's living standards have further declined, and purchasing power has been reduced by 50 to 60 percent; industry and commerce are generally depressed, and industrial output and commercial turnover have generally shrunk by more than 30 percent. All of this is the evil result of the US's implementation of an aggressive policy of "embargo" and refusal to purchase low-grade rubber in order to monopolize the world rubber market, which has brought to the Malayan people.
    From their own personal experience, the Malayan people have deeply realized the importance of defending peace and striving for peace. They love peace and extremely hate the British colonial authorities' aggressive acts and the American war policy. The Malayan people cannot but be enthusiastic about the peace movement and actively fight for the cause of peace. Under the heavy persecution of the British, the Malayan people bravely and enthusiastically responded to the call of the World Peace Council, launched a peace signature campaign, and achieved great results. The Malayan people's desire for peace cannot be stifled, and the Malayan peace movement is rising and developing day by day.
    In November 1951, the General Headquarters of the Malayan National Liberation Army issued a statement expressing its support for the resolutions of the Second Session of the World Peace Council, advocating that the Malayan war be resolved through peaceful negotiations on the principle of national self-determination and the withdrawal of foreign troops. The Malayan people believe that this is a reasonable proposition, so they fully support it and are willing to work for its realization.
    The convening of this Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is a great encouragement to the Malayan people, who love peace and are persevering in the struggle for national independence and peace. The more than six million people of Malaya warmly welcome and fully support this peace conference and have sent representatives to participate in the conference. The Malayan representatives expressed to the conference the aspirations of their country's people to love peace and strive for independence, put forward the correct way to solve the Malayan problem, and appealed to the people of the world, especially the people of countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, to resolutely stop the war atrocities that the British colonial authorities are carrying out in Malaya and are increasingly expanding and intensifying, and to support the Malayan people's just war for independence and defending peace. The Malayan people's just struggle is not isolated, which has been once again well proven by the repeated and keen concern for the Malayan issue from the representatives of various countries attending this peace conference and the distinguished guests participating in the conference. The Malayan people are very precious and very grateful for this enthusiastic assistance from the people of the world.
    The Malayan people especially cannot forget the profound friendship of the great Chinese people for them and the deep sympathy for their arduous struggle. The great experience of the Chinese people in defeating imperialist aggression, winning national liberation and independence, and striving for their own peaceful and happy life is an excellent example for the Malayan people. The continuous victories of the heroic Chinese people's great struggle against aggression and defending peace will greatly encourage the Malayan people who are struggling for independence and peace to move forward.
    The Malayan people firmly believe that the united strength of the people of the world is fully capable of defending peace. The Malayan people are equally confident in the inevitable victory of their own just struggle for independence and peace, because this struggle is based on the unshakable desire for independence and peace of the more than six million Malayan people and has received the enthusiastic support of the peace-loving people of the world. And the victory of the Malayan people's struggle is also a victory for the world's peace cause.

    马来亚人民为民族独立与和平事业而斗争
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议马来亚代表  曾雪虹
    目前，马来亚人民正在为民族独立与和平事业而进行着坚持不懈的斗争。
    马来亚人民热爱自由与和平，有着争取独立与保卫和平的光荣传统。自一七八六年英国侵略者侵入马来亚的时候起，马来亚人民就不断地展开了反对英国殖民地统治，争取民族独立解放的坚决斗争。一九四一年至一九四五年，在日本军国主义者侵占马来亚，实行极端残酷的血腥统治的“黑暗的日子”里，英国军队狼狈败逃，马来亚人民毫不畏惧地用团结一致的力量，英勇地进行了抗日游击战争，并终于在世界各国人民的支持之下，打败了日本侵略者，取得了胜利。马来亚人民抗日战争的伟大胜利，证明了他们为民族独立与和平事业而斗争的决心，也证明了他们是有足够的力量去战胜敌人，以赢得独立与保卫和平的。
    日本投降后，马来亚人民所一心热望的，是迅速治理战争创伤，建设安居乐业、自由美好的生活。可是，英国帝国主义不顾马来亚人民的这个善良愿望，横蛮地打击马来亚人民战后的民主要求，继续实行而且加紧它在马来亚的殖民地奴役制度。在战争结束还不到半年的时光中，英国帝国主义加倍残酷地统治马来亚人民的狰狞面孔，即已完全暴露。一九四五年十二月，英国强行解散坚持抗日斗争有功的“马来亚人民抗日军”，并相继逮捕抗日分子及其领袖。与此同时，英国又宣布恢复其在战前的一切反动法令，包括“驱逐法令”与“煽动法令”等等。一九四六年二月，前东南亚盟军统帅蒙巴顿更公然派出大批军警特务，血腥屠杀参加“新加坡沦陷日纪念大会”的群众，造成有名的“二、一五大血案”。经过抗日战争的锻炼而且觉醒了的马来亚人民，是绝对不能忍受英国殖民当局的这种种压迫的。于是，他们奋起斗争，展开了蓬勃的民主运动。战后马来亚人民民主运动十分高涨。例如：一九四六年一月新加坡十九万工人大罢工，抗议英当局无理逮捕工人领袖，得到全马来亚百分之九十的商界罢市响应，使全国各地交通运输与公共机关陷入瘫痪状态。又如：一九四七年十月全马来亚各界反对英国“马来亚新政制”计划的总罢业，也大大地打击了英国帝国主义的殖民地政策。
    一九四八年六月，英国殖民当局为了进一步镇压马来亚人民的独立运动，向马来亚人民实行了全面的军事进攻。四年多来，在美国帝国主义的支持下，英国出动将近四十万的军警和各种新式飞机大炮，甚至一再违反国际公法，大量使用毒气和化学武器等等，大规模滥炸民房和摧毁庄稼，残酷地屠杀广大的和平居民。截至现在为止，英国殖民当局已把三万多的无辜人民拘禁与驱逐出境，其中包括大批妇女、幼童和老年人，他们都毫无例外地受到英国军警的凌辱、拷打和其他各种毒刑（刑罚之多，竟达七十余种）。在乡村地区，有四十余万农民和大批工人已被赶出他们的田园和工作地区，集中管制在四百多个“移殖新村”里，受着英国军警特务的严密监视，完全丧失了自由，不少甚至连工作权利也被剥夺了。此外，英国还实行“集体惩罚”等措施，企图胁迫马来亚人民屈从于其暴力统治之下。但是，英国在马来亚的彻头彻尾的法西斯恐怖统治，恰恰暴露了它对马来亚人民民主力量是十分畏惧的。
    然而，英勇的马来亚人民并没有被英国的血腥镇压所吓倒、所屈服；相反地，他们为着实现民族独立的崇高理想而进行了坚决的斗争。马来亚各民族人民的优秀儿女组成了马来亚民族解放军，一再粉碎了英国侵略军的野蛮进攻，并从最初成立时的九个支队发展到现今的十二个支队。在马来亚人民的坚决打击下，英国帝国主义在一九四八年六月发动战争时所吹嘘的“十五个月内平息战争”的狂妄梦想，在一九五○年初发动的所谓“反匪月”进攻，从一九五○年至一九五一年实施的反人民军事计划——“布里格斯计划”等等，都已先后可耻地破产了。负责执行这些血腥计划的人员，如前马来亚陆军总司令布却尔少将和前马来亚联合邦作战总指挥布里格斯中将等，也都已被撤职。
    在斗争中，马来亚人民不顾英国军警的屠杀，冒着生命危险，以粮食和其他物品供应游击队，坚决反抗英国殖民地当局大规模强迫搬迁的计划，以及它的“粮食统制”和野蛮的“集体惩罚”等措施。广大的马来亚青年反对征兵的英勇斗争，则严重地打击了马来亚英国殖民当局的扩军阴谋。因此，它的第一个大规模强迫征兵的计划，仅仅完成百分之十五就遭到了可耻的失败。四年多来，马来亚人民为着民族独立的正义事业流血牺牲，前仆后继，其可歌可泣的英雄事迹是无法尽数的。
    英国殖民者的统治，不但剥夺了马来亚人民的独立权利，而且摧残了他们的和平生活。人所共知，马来亚的橡胶和锡的产量是十分丰富的，占世界产量的第一位。但是，马来亚人民每年用辛勤劳动生产得来的橡胶和锡，都全给英国掠夺去了。一九五一年，英国从马来亚人民身上赚得纯利四亿多美元，较一九五○年约增加了六分之一；英国资本的胶锡公司因此平均获得了百分之四十至五十的红利，最高的竟达百分之一百五十。而另一方面，马来亚人民的生活却急剧恶化。例如：生活指数较上一年增加百分之七十，仅在新加坡一地，全部失业人口即达工人总数的百分之十五。不但如此，马来亚人民还被迫担负着英国在马来亚所进行的殖民战争的巨额战费，一九五二年度约在三亿美元以上，即每人平均负担五十美元左右，相当于一个人二十个月的生活费。英国殖民当局的沉重压榨，完全破坏了马来亚人民安居乐业的和平幸福生活。
    美国在朝鲜所进行的冒险的侵略战争，以及它的疯狂的备战政策，使得马来亚人民遭受到更加深重的灾难。最近马来亚爆发了严重的经济危机：橡胶价格暴跌了三分之二，橡胶生产量减缩了五分之二；大批工人失业，在业工人的工资也被削减了百分之十至五十；人民的生活水平更加降低，购买能力已减低了百分之五十至六十；工商业普遍萧条，工业产额和商业营业额一般都减缩了百分之三十以上。这一切，就是美国实行“禁运”和拒绝收购低级胶以垄断世界橡胶市场的侵略政策，给马来亚人民带来的恶果。
    马来亚人民从自己的切身体验当中，深刻地认识到保卫和平、争取和平的重要意义。他们热爱和平，极端憎恨英国殖民当局的侵略行为和美国的战争政策。马来亚人民不能不热心于和平运动，积极地为和平事业而斗争。马来亚人民在英国的重重迫害之下，勇敢地热烈地响应了世界和平理事会的号召，发动和平签名，而且取得了巨大的成绩。马来亚人民的和平愿望是不能被扼杀的，马来亚和平运动是一天比一天地高涨着、发展着。
    一九五一年十一月，马来亚民族解放军总司令部发布声明，表示拥护世界和平理事会第二届会议的决议，主张在民族自决和撤退外国军队的原则下，以和平谈判的方式来解决马来亚战争。马来亚人民认为这是一个合理的主张，因此完全拥护它，并且愿意为其实现而努力。
    此次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，对于酷爱和平并为民族独立与和平事业而坚持着斗争的马来亚人民，是一个极大的鼓舞。马来亚六百多万人民热烈欢迎和全力拥护这个和平会议，并且派遣代表参加了大会。马来亚代表向大会表达了他们国家的人民热爱和平、争取独立的心愿，提出了正确解决马来亚问题的途径，并吁请了全世界人民，首先是亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民，坚决制止英国殖民当局在马来亚所进行着的而且是日益扩大和加紧着的战争暴行，支持马来亚人民争取独立与保卫和平的正义战争。马来亚人民的正义斗争并不孤立，从出席这次和平会议的各国代表先生们和参加会议的贵宾们对于马来亚问题一再的热切关怀当中，又一次得到了极好的证明。马来亚人民是非常珍贵和十分感激全世界人民对于他们的这种热情的援助的。
    马来亚人民特别不能忘却伟大的中国人民对于他们的深厚的友谊，以及对于他们的艰苦斗争的深厚同情。中国人民战胜帝国主义侵略，赢得民族独立解放，并且为着自己的和平幸福生活而努力奋斗的伟大经历，乃是马来亚人民极好的榜样。英雄的中国人民反对侵略，保卫和平的伟大斗争接二连三的胜利，将极大地鼓舞着为争取独立与和平而斗争的马来亚人民的前进。
    马来亚人民坚信：全世界人民团结一致的力量，是完全能够捍卫和平的。马来亚人民对于他们自己为争取独立与和平的正义斗争之必然胜利，同样是满怀信心的，因为这个斗争是以六百多万马来亚人民的不可动摇的独立与和平的愿望为基础的，并且得到了全世界和平人民的热烈支持。而马来亚人民的斗争的胜利，同时也就是世界和平事业的一个胜利。
