Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 8th. Korean and Chinese People's Army continues to kill and wound large numbers of enemies in mountain battles everywhere. According to incomplete statistics, more than three thousand enemy troops were annihilated in the first five days of October.

During these five days, fierce mountain battles were fought in the Lianchuan southwest area in the west and on the east bank of the North Han River in the east. On the western front, our army launched counterattacks against the constantly invading enemy, and on the evening of the 2nd, captured five positions including the North Mountain of Xichangli southwest of Lianchuan, annihilating six platoons and one squad of the defending enemy, totaling more than 280 people. In the three days from the 3rd to the 5th, our army annihilated more than 1,800 enemies who came to counterattack on two high grounds near Xichangli. On the eastern front, on two high grounds near Yuyunli on the east bank of the North Han River, our army annihilated nearly a thousand enemies in two days of blocking battles. The battle for these areas was more intense than last month. Under the cover of airplanes and artillery, the enemy concentrated entire battalions of troops to launch continuous rounds of attacks on one high ground, vainly attempting to seize the mountain position. The heroic Korean and Chinese People's Army calmly responded to the battle, and as soon as the enemy climbed close to the top of the mountain, they suddenly launched fierce fire at them, causing the enemy to suffer heavy casualties and retreat in defeat.

From the 1st to the 5th, the enemy窜犯 more than ten times in other areas of the front line, and were repelled by our army in a very short period of time each time. In these small battles, about 220 enemy troops were annihilated.

In these five days, our artillery units killed and wounded nearly a thousand enemy troops, destroyed nine enemy tanks, and damaged ten enemy tanks. Our frontline anti-aircraft units shot down nineteen enemy planes and damaged thirty-eight enemy planes.

    朝中部队五天歼敌三千名以上
    前线对空射击部队毁伤敌机五十七架
    【新华社朝鲜前线八日电】朝中人民军队继续在各处山地争夺战中杀伤大量敌人，据不完全统计，在十月份的头五天中共歼灭敌军三千名以上。
    在这五天中，在西线的涟川西南和东线的北汉江东岸地区激烈地进行着山地争夺战。西线我军向不断进犯的敌人展开反击战，在二日夜间分别攻下涟川西南西场里北山等五个阵地，全歼守敌六个排和一个班，共二百八十多名。在三日至五日的三天中，我军在西场里附近的两个高地上又歼灭了前来反扑的敌人一千八百多名。在东线北汉江东岸渔云里附近的两个高地上，我军在两天的阻击战中歼灭了近千名敌人。上述地区的争夺战比上月份更为激烈。敌人曾在飞机、大炮掩护下集中整营兵力向一个高地进行不间断地轮番攻击，妄图夺取山头阵地。英勇的朝中人民部队沉着应战，待敌人刚爬近山头时即突然向他们发射猛烈火力，使敌人遭受惨重伤亡，纷纷向后败退。
    在一日至五日间，敌人在前线其他地区窜犯十次以上，每次都在很短时间内被我军击退。在这些小的战斗中，敌军被歼约二百二十多名。
    这五天中我炮兵部队打死打伤敌军近千名，击毁敌军坦克九辆，击伤敌军坦克十辆。我前线对空射击部队打落敌机十九架，打伤敌机三十八架。
