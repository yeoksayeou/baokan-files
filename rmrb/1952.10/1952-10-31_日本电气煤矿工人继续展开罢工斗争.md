Japanese electrical and coal mine workers continue to launch strike struggles.

[Report from this newspaper] Comprehensive news: To demand wage increases to improve living standards, the broad masses of Japanese workers have recently launched continuous strike struggles.

The All-Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union, with 120,000 members, held seven consecutive power outage strikes on September 24, October 3, 7, 11, 15, 21, 22, and 28. The fifth strike by Japanese electrical industry workers on the 15th caused 104 hydroelectric power plants and 21 thermal power plants across Japan to cease operations, reducing the national electricity supply by 18 percent. The sixth strike on the 21st and 22nd caused power outages for eight hours each day. According to the union's plan, the strike reduced power generation by 20 percent on the first day and 25 percent on the second day. According to the Japan Central Electric Power Dispatch Office's statistics on the seventh power outage strike, as of 11:00 AM on the 28th, workers from 171 hydroelectric power plants and 16 thermal power plants had participated in the strike. It is estimated that this strike will reduce the national electricity supply by 25 percent.

The Japan Coal Miners' Union, representing workers from sixteen major coal mining companies, held a 48-hour strike on October 13 and 14, with 240,000 workers participating. The strike reduced coal production by 100,000 tons per day. It began an indefinite strike on the 17th. Small and medium-sized coal mine unions in Kyushu, Yamaguchi, Joban, Hokkaido, and other regions, with approximately 30,000 workers, also planned to begin a strike on the 25th in support of the major coal mining companies' workers.

The Yoshida government is using reactionary laws and despicable means to undermine and suppress the Japanese workers' strike movement. The American occupation forces have even threatened to implement "martial law" if "order" cannot be maintained. However, the Japanese working class has not been intimidated by the fascist terror of the US and Japanese reactionaries. On the contrary, the struggle is becoming increasingly fierce. While the electricity and coal mine workers are on strike, the Japan Council of Government Employees Unions launched a struggle on the 13th of this month to demand a year-end bonus equivalent to two months' salary. The workers of the National Railway Workers' Union have also put forward demands for wage increases. Japanese metalworkers, auto workers, and synthetic chemical workers are also preparing to put forward demands for wage increases.

10,000 workers from various unions affiliated with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held a rally in Tokyo on the 25th. They passed a resolution to support the wage increase strike struggles of the electrical industry workers and coal miners, demanding that the basic monthly salary of Japanese government officials be immediately increased to 16,800 yen. They also demanded the overthrow of the reactionary Yoshida government. The workers participating in this rally also held a demonstration parade after the meeting.

    日本电气煤矿工人继续展开罢工斗争
    【本报讯】综合消息：日本广大工人为了要求增加工资以改善生活，最近展开了连续的罢工斗争。
    拥有十二万名会员的全日本电气产业工会于九月二十四日、十月三日、七日、十一日、十五日、二十一日和二十二日、二十八日连续举行了七次停电罢工。日本电气产业工人在十五日举行的第五次罢工，使日本全国一百零四家水力发电厂和二十一家火力发电厂停止了工作，使日本全国电力供应减少了百分之十八。二十一日和二十二日举行的第六次罢工，每天停电八小时。根据工会的计划，第一天罢工使发电量减少百分之二十，第二天减少百分之二十五。第七次停电罢工据日本中央电力调配所统计，到二十八日上午十一时为止，参加这次罢工的已有一百七十一个水力发电厂和十六个火力发电厂的工人。估计这次罢工将使日本全国电力供应量减少百分之二十五。
    代表十六个大煤矿公司工人的日本煤矿工会于十月十三日和十四日两天举行了四十八小时的罢工，参加罢工的工人有二十四万人，罢工使煤产量每天减少了十万吨。并自十七日起，开始了无一定期限的罢工。九州、山口、常磐、北海道等地中小煤矿工会约三万工人，为了声援大煤矿公司的工人，也定于二十五日起开始罢工。
    吉田政府利用反动法律并以卑劣手段破坏及镇压日本工人的罢工运动，美国占领军并扬言假若“秩序”不能维持就要实行“戒严”。但是日本工人阶级并没有被美、日反动派法西斯恐怖的迫害所吓倒，斗争反而是愈来愈激烈了。在电业及煤矿工人大罢工的同时，日本官厅工会协议会于本月十三日发起了要求发给相当于两个月薪金的年终津贴的斗争。国营铁道工会工人也已经提出增加工资的要求，日本金属工人、汽车工人以及合成化学工人等也已准备提出增加工资的要求。
    日本工会总评议会所属各工会的工人一万人于二十五日在东京举行集会，通过决议，支援电气产业工人和煤矿工人要求增加工资的罢工斗争，要求立即将日本政府机关工作人员每月的基准工资提高到一万六千八百日圆，同时要求打倒反动的吉田政府。参加这个集会的工人并在大会结束后举行了示威大游行。
