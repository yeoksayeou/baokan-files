The "Truth" newspaper in the Soviet Union today reprinted Comrade Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," published in the magazine "Bolshevik." This new classic work includes several of Comrade Stalin's works on economic issues related to the 1951 discussion.

Comrade Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is a great contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory. This new theoretical work by Comrade Stalin is a brilliant example of the inseparable unity of revolutionary theory and revolutionary practice. This scientifically significant work, which is extremely important both theoretically and practically, has profound international significance.

Comrade Stalin, through his profound research into fundamental modern issues, summarizing the experiences of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the international revolutionary movement, continuously enriches Marxist-Leninist theory with new scientific principles and conclusions. These works by Comrade Stalin point out the path to the complete victory of communism to the Soviet people, encourage the working people of the people's democratic countries to create glorious achievements in socialist construction, and call on the working people of the world to struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

These new theoretical works of Comrade Stalin are published at a time when our party, the entire Soviet people, are welcoming the significant day of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) with great excitement, and this congress will determine the party's tasks in the current historical stage.

"Now, – as written in the draft amendment to the Party Constitution – the main task of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is: to build a communist society through the gradual transition from socialism to communism, to continuously improve the material and cultural level of society, to educate members of society in the spirit of internationalism and fraternal ties with the working people of all countries, and to strive to strengthen the active defense of the Soviet motherland to prevent enemy aggression."

In his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Comrade Stalin comprehensively elucidated the fundamental issues of socialist political economy, analyzed for the first time in Marxist literature the nature of socialist economic laws, defined the basic economic law of socialism, and determined the basic conditions for the gradual transition from socialism to communism. Comrade Stalin creatively developed the theories of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, dealt a fatal blow to various anti-Marxist views, and criticized the erroneous arguments of individual economists.

Comrade Stalin revealed the nature and role of socialist economic laws, which are objective laws reflecting the process of economic development independent of people's will. People can discover the laws of nature and society, understand them, study them, take them into account in their actions, and use them for the benefit of society, but people cannot change or abolish these laws. Therefore, it is extremely wrong to think that under socialism people can eliminate economic laws and create other laws or "transform" these laws according to their own will. Comrade Stalin teaches us that economic laws are not eliminated, but lose their effectiveness due to the emergence of new economic conditions, retire from the stage, and give way to new laws, which are not created by people's will but arise on the basis of new economic conditions.

However, society is not powerless in the face of laws. After understanding economic laws, relying on them, society can use them for the benefit of society. The banner bearers of using economic laws for the benefit of society are always and everywhere the advanced classes, while the declining classes resist this. There must be social forces capable of overcoming this resistance. In our country, this force has been found, in the form of the alliance of the working class and the peasantry. This is the secret of why the Soviet regime was able to crush the old social forces, and why the economic law that relations of production must conform to the nature of the productive forces has gained full scope for action in the Soviet Union. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the Soviet regime, based on the economic law that relations of production must conform to the nature of the productive forces, socialized the means of production, making them the property of the whole people, thereby eliminating the system of exploitation and creating socialist economic forms. Without this law, and without relying on this law, the Soviet regime would not have been able to complete its tasks.

Comrade Stalin's discovery of the basic economic law of socialism is of immense significance.

"The main features and requirements of the basic economic law of socialism," Comrade Stalin teaches us, "can be roughly expressed as follows: to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by means of the continuous growth and continuous improvement of socialist production on the basis of high technology."

This definition reveals the deepest essence of socialism, the nature of socialism. In this definition, the purpose of socialist production is emphasized, and the means to achieve this purpose are pointed out. The basic economic law of socialism represents the enormous superiority of socialism over capitalism. The purpose of socialist production is not profit, but people and their needs. Socialist production is subordinate to the main purpose – to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society.

The Party, proceeding from the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism, guides the continuous development of the economy and ensures the smooth completion of the national economic plan. The draft directives of the 19th Party Congress on the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the USSR in 1951-1955 clearly reflect the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism discovered and scientifically demonstrated by Comrade Stalin.

"The Fifth Five-Year Plan," the draft directives state, "determines a new and grand upsurge in the Soviet national economy and ensures a further and enormous increase in the material welfare and cultural level of the people. The implementation of the Fifth Five-Year Plan will be a major step forward on the road of development from socialism to communism."

In elaborating the basic problems of socialist political economy, Comrade Stalin comprehensively explained the characteristics of commodity production under the socialist system. He made the following important scientific conclusion: under the socialist system, there exists a special kind of commodity production, namely commodity production without the participation of capitalists, which is basically related to the commodities of the united socialist producers. The scope of activity of this commodity production is limited to personal consumer goods. Comrade Stalin explained that under the socialist system, the means of production cannot be included in the category of commodities. The necessity of special commodity production under the socialist system is constrained by the existence of two basic forms of socialist production – the state (national) form and the collective farm form.

Unlike capitalism, commodity production under the socialist system does not lead to the generation of capitalist relations. Due to the decisive conditions of the establishment of public ownership of the means of production and the elimination of the wage labor system and the system of exploitation, commodity production is placed within strict limits. Comrade Stalin linked the study of commodity production and the law of value under the socialist system with the actual tasks of socialist management, with profitability, economic accounting, valuation, and so on.

Comrade Stalin, the great scientific giant and genius architect of communism, paid great attention to explaining the laws of the transition from the first stage of communism to the second stage. When talking about the scientific definition of communism, Comrade Stalin pointed out that Lenin's formula "Communism is Soviet power plus electrification of the whole country" is the only correct formula.

Comrade Stalin demonstrated the conditions for the gradual transition from socialism to communism, which is a new outstanding contribution to the theory of scientific communism.

Comrade Stalin pointed out that in order to prepare for the transition to communism in practice rather than in declarations, three basic prerequisites must be met.

First, it must be effectively guaranteed that all social production is constantly growing, and that the growth of the production of the means of production takes priority, without which it is impossible to achieve expanded reproduction.

Second, the ownership of collective farms must be raised to the level of ownership by the whole people by means of gradual transition that is beneficial to collective farms and therefore also beneficial to the whole society, and the system of product exchange must be used to replace commodity circulation by means of gradual transition.

Third, society must reach such a high level of cultural development that it guarantees the all-round development of the physical and intellectual abilities of all members of society, so that members of society can obtain an education sufficient to become active participants in social development, and can freely choose their occupations without being bound to a certain occupation for life due to the existing division of labor.

Only after all these prerequisites have been fully realized will the fundamental transition from one economy, namely the socialist economy, to another higher economy, namely the communist economy, be realized.

In his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Comrade Stalin also made a profound Marxist analysis of the most important problems of contemporary capitalism.

Comrade Stalin teaches us that the main characteristics and requirements of the current basic economic law of capitalism are: "to ensure the maximum capitalist profit by means of exploiting the majority of the country's residents and making them bankrupt and impoverished, by means of enslaving and continuously plundering the people of other countries, especially the people of backward countries, and by means of wars and the militarization of the national economy aimed at ensuring the highest profits."

Comrade Stalin showed the sharpening of the general crisis of capitalism at the present stage and emphasized that the most important result in the economic field of the Second World War and its economic impact must be considered the disintegration of the unified and all-encompassing world market. This determines the further deepening of the general crisis of the world capitalist system.

In contrast to the capitalist camp, a unified and powerful socialist camp has been formed, which has caused the disintegration of the unified and all-encompassing world market and the formation of two parallel and mutually opposed world markets. At the same time, the United States, Britain, and France, by implementing a policy of economic blockade against the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries of Europe, have promoted the consolidation of the formation of a new parallel world market, although not out of their own intention. The countries of the socialist camp have already been economically united and have established economic cooperation and mutual assistance. The formation of a powerful socialist camp shows that the scope of the seizure of world resources by major capitalist countries will not expand but will shrink, the conditions of the world sales market will worsen for these countries, and the phenomenon of insufficient start-up of enterprises in these countries will increase. All this shows that although the cyclical nature of capitalist development is still preserved, the growth of production in capitalist countries will proceed on a reduced basis, because the production volume of these countries will be reduced.

Comrade Stalin pointed out that the world capitalist system is undergoing a comprehensive economic and political crisis. The basis of this crisis is the increasingly violent disintegration of the world capitalist economic system, and the growing power of various countries that have broken away from the capitalist system – the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries. The weakening of capitalism has deepened its internal contradictions and sharpened the struggle between imperialist robbers.

Comrade Stalin teaches us that arming our cadres with the knowledge of the laws of socio-economic development is one of the most important tasks of the Party. Therefore, the creation of a textbook on Marxist political economy is of great significance.

Comrade Stalin wrote: "This textbook is not only needed by our Soviet youth. It is especially needed by the communists of all countries and all those who sympathize with the communists. Our foreign comrades want to know how we got rid of the shackles of capitalism, how we transformed the national economy in the spirit of socialism, how we achieved friendly relations with the peasants, how we made our country, which was recently poor and weak, into a rich and strong country, what is a collective farm, and why we have not eliminated commodity production, currency, trade, etc., although we have socialized the means of production. They want to know all this and many other things, not simply out of curiosity, but to learn from us and to use our experience for their own countries. Therefore, the publication of a good textbook on Marxist political economy has not only domestic political significance, but also great international significance."

Comrade Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is the highest stage of the development of Marxist-Leninist political economy. The publication of this work is an extremely important event in the ideological life of the Party and the Soviet people. It has truly historical significance. Stalin's work will have a huge impact on the development of advanced Soviet science. It will help our cadres more deeply understand the laws of social development. It will play a huge role in ideologically arming foreign communist and workers' parties.

Our Party is implementing Comrade Stalin's genius instructions, leading the Soviet people forward to the victory of communism.

    对于马克思列宁主义理论的伟大贡献
    苏联“真理报”十月三日社论
    今天“真理报”转载了“布尔什维克”杂志所发表的斯大林同志的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。这一新的经典著作，包括了斯大林同志就一九五一年讨论会有关的经济问题所写的几篇作品。
    斯大林同志的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”是对于马克思列宁主义理论的伟大贡献。斯大林同志这一新的理论著作，是革命理论和革命实践不可分割的统一的光辉范例。这一在理论上和实践上都极其重要的科学著作，具有极重大的国际意义。
    斯大林同志以其对于现代根本问题的深刻研究，概括苏联社会主义建设和国际革命运动的经验，不断地以新的科学原理和结论来丰富马克思列宁主义理论。斯大林同志的这些作品给苏联人民指出走向共产主义完全胜利的道路，鼓舞各人民民主国家的劳动人民在社会主义建设中创立光荣的勋业，号召全世界劳动人民为和平、民主与社会主义而斗争。
    斯大林同志的这些新的理论作品，是在我们的党、全体苏联人民正以万分兴奋的心情来迎接联共
    （布）第十九次代表大会这一有重大意义的日子里发表的，而这次代表大会将决定党在现今历史阶段上的任务。
    “现在，——在修改党章的草案中写道，——苏联共产党的主要任务是：通过由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的途径来建立共产主义社会，不断地提高社会的物质和文化的水平，用国际主义以及与世界各国劳动人民建立兄弟联系的精神来教育社会成员，竭力加强苏维埃祖国的积极防御，以防止敌人的侵略行动。”
    斯大林同志在“苏联社会主义经济问题”这一著作中全面地阐明了社会主义政治经济学的根本问题，破天荒第一次在马克思主义文献中分析了社会主义经济法则的性质，规定了社会主义的基本经济法则，并确定了从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的基本条件。斯大林同志创造性地发展了马克思、恩格斯、列宁的学说，给了各种反马克思主义的观点以致命的打击，批判了个别经济学家的错误论断。
    斯大林同志揭示了社会主义经济法则的性质和作用，这些法则是反映不以人们的意志为转移的经济发展过程的客观法则。人们能发现自然和社会的法则，认识它们，研究它们，在自己的行动中估计到它们，利用它们来为社会谋福利，但是人们不能改变和废除这些法则。因此，认为在社会主义条件下人们能消灭经济法则，并按照自己的意志创造其他法则或“改造”这些法则，这是极其错误的。斯大林同志教导我们说：经济法则并不是被消灭，而是由于出现了新的经济条件而失去效力，退出舞台，让位给新的法则，这些新的法则并不是由人们的意志创造出来，而是在新的经济条件的基础上产生的。
    然而社会在法则面前并不是无能为力的，社会认识了经济法则以后，依靠它们，就能利用它们来为社会谋福利。利用经济法则来为社会谋福利的旗手，无论何时何地都是先进的阶级，而衰朽的阶级则对此表示反抗。必须有能够克服这种反抗的社会力量。在我国，找到了这种力量，其形式就是工人阶级和农民的联盟。苏维埃政权之所以能够粉碎了旧的社会力量，而生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这个经济法则之所以在苏联获得了发生作用的充分广阔场所，其秘密就在于此。斯大林同志指出：苏维埃政权依据生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一经济法则，把生产资料公有化了，使之成为全民的财产，因而消灭了剥削制度，创造了社会主义经济形式。如果没有这个法则，不依靠这个法则，苏维埃政权是不能完成自己的任务的。
    斯大林同志之发现社会主义的基本经济法则，是具有极巨大的意义的。
    “社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求，——斯大林同志教导我们说，——可以大致表述如下：用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。”
    这个定义揭示了社会主义最深刻的实质、社会主义的本性。在这个定义中，强调了社会主义生产的目的，指出了达到这个目的的手段。社会主义的基本经济法则表示了社会主义对于资本主义的巨大优越性。社会主义生产的目的不是利润，而是人及其需要。社会主义生产服从于主要目的——保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    党从社会主义基本经济法则的要求出发，指导经济不断地向前发展，保证国民经济计划的顺利完成。第十九次党代表大会关于一九五一—一九五五年苏联发展五年计划的指示草案，清楚地反映了斯大林同志所发现的和科学地论证了的社会主义基本经济法则的要求。
    “第五个五年计划，——指示草案中指出道，——决定苏联国民经济的新的壮大的高涨，并保证人民的物质福利和文化水平的进一步巨大的增长。
    第五个五年计划的实现，将是在从社会主义到共产主义的发展道路上迈进一大步。”
    斯大林同志在阐释社会主义政治经济学的基本问题时，全面地说明了社会主义制度下商品生产的特点。他作出了下面这个重要的科学结论：在社会主义制度下，存在着特种的商品生产，即没有资本家参加的商品生产，这种商品生产基本上是与联合的社会主义生产者的商品有关的。这种商品生产的活动范围只限于个人消费品。斯大林同志说明了，在社会主义制度下不能把生产资料列入商品范畴中。社会主义制度下特种商品生产的必要性，是由社会主义生产的两种基本形式——国家的（全民的）形式和集体农庄的形式——的存在所制约的。
    与资本主义不同，商品生产在社会主义制度下并不引起资本主义关系的产生。由于生产资料公有制的建立与雇佣劳动制度和剥削制度的消灭这些决定性的条件，商品生产是被放置在严格的范围内。斯大林同志把社会主义制度下商品生产和价值法则的研究，与社会主义经营的实际任务，与赢利、经济核算、估价等等联系起来。
    伟大的科学巨匠、天才的共产主义建筑师斯大林同志极其注意说明从共产主义第一阶段过渡到第二阶段的规律性。斯大林同志在讲到共产主义的科学定义时指出：列宁的公式“共产主义是苏维埃政权加全国电气化”，是唯一正确的公式。
    斯大林同志论证了从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的条件，这是对于科学共产主义理论的新的杰出的贡献。
    斯大林同志指出，为了准备在实际上而非在宣言上过渡到共产主义，必须实现三个基本的先决条件。
    第一，必须切实加以保证的，是全部社会生产的不断增长，而生产资料生产的增长要占优先地位，没有这点，就不可能实现扩大再生产。
    第二，必须用实行起来有利于集体农庄因而也有利于整个社会的逐渐过渡的办法，来把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，并且也用逐渐过渡的办法使产品交换制来代替商品流通。
    第三，必须使社会达到这样高度的文化发展，保证社会一切成员全面发展他们的体力和智力，使社会成员能获得足以成为社会发展的积极活动家的教育，能自由地选择职业，而不致由于现存的劳动分工而终生束缚于某一种职业。
    只有在这一切先决条件全部实现之后，才会实现从一种经济即社会主义经济到另一种更高的经济即共产主义经济的根本过渡。
    斯大林同志在其“苏联社会主义经济问题”这一著作中，对于现今资本主义极主要的问题也作了深刻的马克思主义的分析。
    斯大林同志教导我们说，现今资本主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求是：“用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。”
    斯大林同志表明了现阶段资本主义总危机的尖锐化，并着重指出：第二次世界大战及其经济影响在经济方面的最重要的结果，必须认为是统一的无所不包的世界市场的瓦解。这决定了世界资本主义体系总危机的进一步加深。
    与资本主义阵营相对立，形成了统一而强大的社会主义阵营，这就引起统一的无所不包的世界市场的瓦解，两个平行的也是互相对立的世界市场的形成。同时，美国、英国和法国因对苏联、中国和欧洲各人民民主国家实行经济封锁的政策，便促成了新的平行的世界市场的形成的巩固，虽然并不是出于它们的本意。社会主义阵营的各个国家已经在经济上结合起来，并且建立了经济上的合作和互助。强大的社会主义阵营的形成是表明，各主要资本主义国家夺取世界资源的范围将不会扩大而会缩小，世界销售市场的条件对于这些国家将会恶化，而这些国家的企业开工不足的现象将会增大。这一切都表明，资本主义发展的周期性质虽然还保存着，可是资本主义国家生产的增长将在缩小的基础上进行，因为这些国家的生产量将要减缩。
    斯大林同志指出，世界资本主义体系正经历着经济和政治的全面危机。这一危机的基础就是世界资本主义经济体系愈来愈剧烈的瓦解，以及从资本主义制度脱离出来的各个国家——苏联、中国和其他各人民民主国家的威力日益强大。资本主义的削弱更加深了它内部的矛盾，使帝国主义强盗间的斗争更尖锐化。
    斯大林同志教导我们说，以社会经济发展法则的知识来武装我们的干部，是党的最重要的任务之一。因此，创作马克思主义政治经济学教科书，便具有巨大的意义。
    斯大林同志写道：“这本教科书不仅对于我们苏联的青年是需要的。它对于各国共产党人以及一切同情共产党人的人们是特别需要的。我们的外国同志们想知道，我们是怎样挣脱了资本主义的镣铐的，我们是怎样以社会主义精神来改造了全国经济的，我们是怎样达到了与农民建立友好关系的，我们是怎样使得我们这个不久以前还是贫弱的国家变成了富强的国家的，什么是集体农庄，为什么我们虽然生产资料已经公有化了，但还没有消灭商品生产、货币、贸易等等。他们想知道这一切以及其他许多东西，并不是简单地为了好奇，而是要向我们学习，并为了自己的国家来利用我们的经验。因此，一本好的马克思主义政治经济学教科书的出版，不仅具有国内的政治意义，而且具有巨大的国际意义。”
    斯大林同志的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”是马克思列宁主义政治经济学发展的最高阶段。这一著作的出版是党和苏联人民思想生活中极重大的事件。它具有真正历史的意义。斯大林的著作对于先进的苏维埃科学的发展将发生巨大的影响，它将帮助我们的干部更深刻地认识社会发展的法则，它在从思想上武装外国的共产党和工人党方面将起巨大的作用。
    我们党正在实现斯大林同志的天才指示，领导苏联人民前进，达到共产主义的胜利。
