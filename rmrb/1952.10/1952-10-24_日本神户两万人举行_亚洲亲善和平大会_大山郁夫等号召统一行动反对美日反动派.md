With the applause of the entire crowd, Toshio Tachibana, a former Diet member of the Communist Party, delivered a speech at the meeting. He emphasized: "Faced with the crisis of the motherland, political parties of all classes should unite on one front, drive the U.S. imperialists out of Japan, and advance to overthrow the traitors."

Ikuo Oyama also called for unified action at the meeting.

Iwao Matsui, a candidate for the House of Representatives from the left-wing Socialist Party, also stated in his speech that joint struggle is truly the demand of the people and is the only path the Socialist Party should take.

    【新华社二十二日讯】东京迟到消息：两万日本人民于九月二十五日在神户举行了“亚洲亲善和平大会”。著名的和平战士大山郁夫也从东京赶来参加大会。在近畿地方各大学教授座谈会的提议之下，大会一致通过决议，要求共产党、劳农党、左派社会党组成统一战线，进行联合斗争。
    共产党的前国会众议员立花敏男在全体群众的鼓掌欢迎下，在会上发表了演讲。他强调说：“面对着祖国的危机，各阶级的政党应该团结在一条战线上，把美帝国主义者从日本赶出去，为打倒卖国贼而前进。”
    大山郁夫在会上也号召采取统一行动。
    左派社会党众议员候选人松井岩男在会上发表演说时也认为：联合斗争才真正是人民大众的要求，这是社会党应走的唯一道路。
    此外，大会并决议要求美国占领军立即撤退，反对制造、运送和使用屠杀人民的武器。
