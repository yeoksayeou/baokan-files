All-China Federation of Cooperatives
Holds Second National Cooperative Industrial Production Conference

    The All-China Federation of Cooperatives held its Second National Cooperative Industrial Production Conference from August 25th to September 5th. Eighty-three representatives from cooperative federations in major administrative regions, provinces (cities), and typical grassroots cooperatives across the country attended the meeting. The conference summarized the work of the past year, exchanged experiences, revised the articles of association of industrial production cooperatives, and formulated a production increase and economy plan, as well as implementation steps for the 1953 work guidelines and production plan.

    A year ago, many members of industrial production cooperatives across the country did not directly participate in labor, and many industrial production cooperatives were even led by capitalists, making them not true production cooperatives. The First National Cooperative Industrial Production Conference in June of last year decided to "rectify before developing." The rectification of industrial production cooperatives was a process of struggle. After rectification, by the end of 1951, the number of members in industrial production cooperatives nationwide decreased from 260,000 to 139,000. Although the number of members decreased, the quality of the members was purified, laying the foundation for the consolidation and development of cooperatives. By June of this year, the number of members had increased to 200,000. In the first half of 1951, Shandong Province's industrial production cooperatives had 46,335 members; in the second half of the year, this increased by 9,258; and in the first half of 1952, it increased by another 28,776. Before rectification, the Xi'an Xinyi Lane Dyeing and Weaving Production Cooperative had only 60 members. After purging six handicraft capitalists, purifying the ranks, and establishing systems, the number of members increased to 124. This proves that the decision to "rectify before developing" was completely correct.

    Over the past year, national industrial production cooperatives have made achievements in production. In 1952, national industrial production cooperatives could produce 44,000 tons of pulp, of which 30,000 tons were supplied to the national paper-making industry as raw materials. National iron and woodworking production cooperatives and production groups produced more than 30 million pieces of large and small agricultural tools annually, supplying them to rural areas in large quantities.

    Over the past year, industrial production cooperatives in various regions have gained the following experiences:

    First, there is great potential in the productivity of Chinese handicrafts. As long as they are organized, the relations of production of handicrafts are changed, the exploitation system is completely abolished, the labor organization is rationally changed, and the production enthusiasm of the masses of handicraft workers is improved. According to some typical materials, even using the original production tools, generally a high output can be achieved. After the Renjiayu Iron Production Cooperative in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, was organized, the production rate of general groups increased by 29.4%, and that of advanced groups increased by 66%.

    Second, the sales of industrial production cooperative products are crucial to the development or failure of the cooperative. It is necessary to improve product quality, reduce costs, and lower prices to achieve high quality and low prices, so that products can be sold far and wide. For example, the Changsha Cotton Weaving Cooperative in Hunan Province experienced sluggish sales in the first quarter of this year due to poor product quality and insufficient size; after improving quality and specifications, sales opened up.

    Third, advanced production management methods such as technical quota management, assembly line operation, piece-rate wages, and bonus systems for exceeding quotas are also applicable to industrial production cooperatives. For example, after the Ganhe Village Sulfur Production Cooperative in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, implemented the four quotas of fixed personnel, fixed materials, fixed quality, and fixed quantity, quality improved, costs decreased, and production efficiency rapidly increased. After the Patriotic Iron Production Cooperative in Hefei City, Anhui Province, implemented quota management, output increased by 60%. The experience of many production cooperatives proves that the piece-rate wage system and the bonus system for exceeding quotas are important factors in improving the production enthusiasm of handicraft workers. Therefore, this conference proposed that various regions should implement them.

    Fourth, when industrial production cooperatives are first organized, in-depth investigation and research should be conducted, and industries should be carefully selected; first, attention should be paid to whether the source of raw materials is sufficient and whether the products have a market. Without investigation and research, without focusing on selecting industries, blindly organizing, and developing randomly, failure is certain.

    Fifth, strengthening class education for members and carrying out ideological transformation are major issues related to the development direction of industrial production cooperatives. To guide small handicraftsmen from the individual economy to the collective economy track, they must be organized according to the principle of voluntariness, and according to the articles of association of the production cooperative, the original production relations of handicrafts must be changed to cooperative and mutual assistance relations, and the wage system of remuneration according to labor must be implemented in order to give full play to the enthusiasm of producers, improve production, and make them realize from their own experience that the collective economy is much better than the individual economy. Only in this way can the shortcomings of small handicraftsmen's scattered, backward, conservative, and selfish habits be overcome, so that industrial production cooperatives can develop normally and healthily, and the degeneration of production cooperatives into capitalism can be avoided.

    After exchanging experiences and listening to reports from leaders of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and Soviet experts, representatives from various regions unanimously believed that industrial production cooperatives play an important role in the entire national economy and have broad prospects for development. The delegates to the meeting increased their confidence in organizing and developing industrial production cooperatives nationwide. The representatives also gained a deeper understanding of the close relationship between industrial production cooperatives and national economic construction, industrial and agricultural production. For example, industrial raw materials produced by pulp, soda ash, sulfur, and leather tanning materials production cooperatives are all necessary for large-scale industry. At present, the products of weaving and dyeing, knitting, iron and wood agricultural tools, bamboo and rattan weaving, civil engineering, and building materials industrial production are in short supply. It is necessary to organize handicraft production in a planned way to supplement the deficiencies in the products of the national large-scale industry. In particular, organizing the production of special handicrafts is of great significance. Chinese special art crafts are highly valued all over the world. Organizing the export of special handicrafts can be exchanged for machines to build the national industry. During the discussion process, the representatives from various regions gained new inspiration and understanding, which will be of great help in grasping the development direction and industry selection of industrial production cooperatives in the future.

    In exchanging experiences, representatives from various regions summarized the experience of rectification in various regions, and introduced advanced experiences and specific situations of typical grassroots cooperatives in organizing production increase and economy, business management, cultural education, and welfare facilities. In order to promote advanced experience and reward inventions, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives specially selected two typical cooperatives, seventeen model cooperatives, and five inventors to give awards. All the representatives were greatly encouraged by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives' emphasis on accumulating experience and rewarding typical models. Everyone expressed that they would make the greatest efforts to implement the various resolutions of this conference in practical work.

    Through this conference, representatives of industrial production cooperatives from various regions have reached a consensus on major issues such as the development direction of industrial production cooperatives, industry selection; the establishment of local production cooperative federations, consolidation and development of organizations; improving business operations, implementing quota management, promoting advanced experience, strengthening ideological education, and implementing and deepening the production increase and economy movement. It is foreseeable that the national industrial production cooperatives will achieve greater development if the various decisions of this conference are earnestly implemented in various regions.

    中华全国合作社联合总社
    召开第二次全国合作社工业生产合作会议
    中华全国合作社联合总社于八月二十五日到九月五日召开了第二次全国合作社工业生产合作会议。到会的有全国各大行政区、省（市）合作社联合社和典型基层社代表八十三人。会议总结了一年来的工作，交换了经验，修改了工业生产合作社章程，并拟定了增产节约方案及一九五三年工作方针和生产计划的实施步骤。
    一年以前，全国各地许多工业生产合作社的社员，很多不直接参加劳动，甚至有不少生产合作社的领导掌握在资本家手里，不是真正的生产合作社。去年六月第一次全国合作社工业生产合作会议，决定“先整理再发展”。整理工业生产合作社的经过是一个斗争的过程。各地工业生产合作社经整顿后，到一九五一年底，社员由二十六万减少到十三万九千人，社员数量虽然减少，但社员质量纯洁了，并为合作社的巩固和发展打下了基础。到今年六月，社员又增加到二十万人。一九五一年上半年，山东省工业生产合作社社员为四万六千三百三十五人，下半年增加了九千二百五十八人；到一九五二年上半年又增加了二万八千七百七十六人。西安信义巷染织生产合作社在整顿前，社员只六十人，清洗了六名手工业资本家，纯洁了队伍，建立了制度，社员发展到一百二十四人。这就证明“先整理再发展”的决定是完全正确的。
    一年来全国工业生产合作社在生产上是有成绩的。一九五二年全国工业生产合作社可产纸浆四万四千吨，其中三万吨系供给国家造纸工业做原料。全国铁木业生产合作社和生产小组，年产大小农具三千多万件，大量地供应农村。
    一年来各地工业生产合作社的工作已取得如下一些经验：
    第一，中国手工业的生产力存在着很大的潜力，只要组织起来，改变手工业的生产关系，彻底取消剥削制度，合理地改变劳动组织，提高手工工人群众的生产积极性，根据一些典型材料，就是利用原来的生产工具，一般也可以达到很高的产量。山西阳泉市任家峪铁业生产合作社组织起来后，一般的组生产率提高百分之二十九点四，先进组提高百分之六十六。
    第二，工业生产合作社产品销路是关系着合作社发展或失败的关键。必须提高产品质量，降低成本，减低售价，做到价廉物美，才能远近畅销。如湖南长沙棉织社今年第一季度因产品质量太坏，尺码不足，销路停滞；经过提高品质，改进规格后，销路就打开了。
    第三，技术定额管理，流水作业，计件工资和超额奖励制度等先进生产管理方法，对于工业生产合作社也是适用的。如山西省阳泉市甘河村硫磺生产合作社实行定员、定材、定质、定量四种定额后，质量提高，成本降低，生产率迅速提高。安徽省合肥市爱国铁业生产合作社实行定额管理后，产量提高百分之六十。不少生产合作社的经验证明，计件工资制和超额奖励制对提高手工业工人的生产积极性是很重要的因素，因此这次会议提出各地应贯彻执行。
    第四，工业生产合作社在开始组织时，应深入调查研究，慎重选择行业；首先要注意原料来源是否充足，产品是否有销路。不经过调查研究，没有重点地选择行业，盲目组织，乱加发展，招致失败是可以肯定的。
    第五，加强对社员的阶级教育，进行思想改造，是关系着工业生产合作社发展方向的重大问题。把小手工业者从个体经济引导到集体经济轨道上来，必须按自愿的原则把他们组织起来，并须根据生产合作社章程，改变手工业原来的生产关系为合作互助关系，实行按劳取酬的工资制度，才能充分发挥生产者的积极性，将生产搞好，并使他们从亲身经验中，体会到集体经济比个体经济好得多。也只有这样，才能克服小手工业者散漫、落后、保守自私的毛病，使工业生产合作社得到正常的健康的发展，并可避免生产合作社变质走资本主义的道路。
    各地代表经过相互交换经验及听了全国合作总社领导人和苏联专家的报告后，一致认为工业生产合作社在整个国民经济中有重大作用，且有广阔发展前途。与会代表对于在全国范围组织和发展工业生产合作社都提高了信心。代表们对于工业生产合作社与国家经济建设、工农业生产的密切关系也得到进一步的认识。如纸浆、土碱、硫磺、制革鞣料等生产合作社生产的工业原料，都为大工业所必需。现在织染、针织、铁木农具、竹藤编织、土建工程、建筑材料等工业生产的产品都感供不应求，必须有计划地组织手工业生产，以补国家大工业产品之不足。尤其是组织特种手工艺生产更有重大意义。中国特种美术工艺品在全世界上评价甚高，组织特种手工艺品出口，可以换取机器来建设国家工业。各地代表在讨论过程中，得到了新的启示和认识，这对今后掌握工业生产合作社发展方向及行业选择是有很大作用的。
    各地代表在交换经验中，总结了各地整社的经验，介绍了各地典型基层社组织增产节约，经营管理，文化教育，福利设施等先进经验和具体情况。全国合作社联合总社为推广先进经验，奖励创造发明起见，特选定两个典型社、十七个模范社及五位发明创造工作者给予奖励。全体代表对全国总社重视积累经验，奖励典型模范，得到极大的鼓舞。大家都表示要把这次会议的各项决议用最大的努力贯彻到实际工作中去。
    各地工业生产合作社代表经过这次会议，对于工业生产合作社发展方针，选择行业；成立各地的生产合作社联合社，巩固和发展组织；提高业务经营，实行定额管理，推广先进经验，加强思想教育，贯彻和深入增产节约运动等重大问题，都取得了一致的意见。各地根据这次会议各项决定，切实执行起来，全国工业生产合作社将要得到更大的发展，是可以预计的。　（新华社）
