Visiting "Lu Xun's Former Residence"
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Shen Rong

"Lu Xun's Former Residence" is located in a remote alley in the Xicheng district of the capital, specifically at No. 21, West Third Alley, Gongmenkou, Fuchengmen.

For the past three years, how many people have often thought: If only Mr. Lu Xun were still here! As the new China advances, more and more people admire Mr. Lu Xun, and the feeling of missing Mr. Lu Xun has become deeper and deeper. We are eagerly hoping to learn more from this great fighter, and "Lu Xun's Former Residence" itself is very good teaching material.

The comrade in charge of managing "Lu Xun's Former Residence" led us to visit the various rooms. This is a typical Beijing small courtyard house, which Mr. Lu Xun bought with money borrowed from a friend and renovated according to his own ideas.

The north house is a three-bay structure, with the main room protruding one bay towards the backyard, serving as Mr. Lu Xun's bedroom and studio. This room is very small, only about twelve square meters. The interior furnishings were arranged by Ms. Xu Guangping according to the conditions at the time. Everything here is very simple and plain, indicating that the master of this house lived the life of a strong and hardworking warrior.

A bed is placed under the north-facing glass window. It is a wooden bed covered with a thin layer of bedding. Against the east wall is a small desk with a wicker chair in front of it. This room was not heated even in winter; the stove was in the outer main room. The winters in Beijing are so cold, and Mr. Lu Xun often worked here until late at night. "Wild Grass" and "A Call to Arms," among others, were written here. Sometimes he would doze off with his clothes on, then bury himself back under the kerosene lamp and continue working. The kerosene lamp he used is still on the table. He was very strict with himself and never let a day pass casually.

A box sits at the eastern end of the bed, with books on top. When Mr. Lu Xun occasionally lay on the bed to rest, he would casually browse books or appreciate art. In Mr. Lu Xun's life, there was very little rest that involved doing nothing.

A bookshelf sits at one end of the desk, where he kept the books he used frequently. On the west side of the room are a tea table and two chairs. The young people whom Mr. Lu Xun loved were received in this room. At that time, young people came to him almost every day. Sundays were the liveliest; before one group left, another would arrive. Although Mr. Lu Xun was very busy and cherished his time, he never refused such visitors. At that time, these two chairs and the edge of the bed would be full of people, and the smoke from cigarettes filled the small room. Mr. Lu Xun would have deep conversations with the young people here, guiding them in their struggles and in their studies. In this way, through contact with friends, especially young people, he closely connected with the broad masses of the people and was closely related to them. How happy he was when he was with young people! Ms. Xu Guangping said that at such times, his laughter could often be heard in the next room.

Pens, inkstones, and other writing utensils were placed neatly on the desk. When Mr. Lu Xun was alive, everything was always so neat. Everything had its place, making it convenient to use. He considered this very important, saying that if books and utensils were misplaced, it would be like a pharmacist misplacing medicines.

There is also an alarm clock on the desk. Mr. Lu Xun was very punctual. He worked late into the night and went to bed very late, but this clock would wake him up on time the next day. At that time, he taught at Peking University and the Women's Normal University, and worked as a secretary in the Ministry of Education. He went to work on time every day.

The room south of Mr. Lu Xun's residence is the main room. The furnishings are also extremely simple. On the east side is a square table and two chairs for dining. Near the door, there is an uncovered wicker trunk containing Mr. Lu Xun's frequently changed clothes. In winter, a small stove was lit here. The rooms on the east and west sides of the main room were originally occupied by Mr. Lu Xun's family, but now they are filled with many books. Most of the books from his Shanghai residence have been transported here; together with those originally here, there are more than 10,000 volumes. These books have been preliminarily sorted, and the People's Government has designated specialists to prepare and print a catalog.

Leaving the north house, there is a small courtyard where Mr. Lu Xun personally planted lilacs, which are now growing luxuriantly. Behind the north house is another backyard with yellow plum blossoms and other trees planted by Mr. Lu Xun himself.

The jujube trees mentioned in "Autumn Night," according to the comrade in charge of managing "Lu Xun's Former Residence," refer to the two trees outside the north wall of the backyard, which have long been cut down. A locust tree now grows there. The south house consists of two rooms, one large and one small, which used to be Mr. Lu Xun's study and reception room. The furnishings here are also extremely simple, mainly bookshelves and book boxes filled with books. On the east wall hangs a portrait of Mr. Lu Xun. A crystal vase sits on a small table in the study, enclosed in a box. This was a gift from the Czechoslovakian cultural delegation. Over the past three years, many international friends have visited here. Soviet writer Fadeyev and others have also visited here.

Since the founding of the new China, "Lu Xun's Former Residence" has been opened once a year on the anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death. When it is open, the crowds flow endlessly. It was first opened on October 19, 1949, and more than 10,000 people came to pay their respects that day. The line of visitors stretched long and filled the two nearby alleys. Last year it was open for a month. This year it will be open for half a month, starting from October 19th. Even when it is not open, people come with letters of introduction every day, requesting to visit. Mr. Lu Xun spent his life pursuing the rebirth of China. Now his wishes have been realized, and his fighting spirit is being increasingly promoted and carried forward. He will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese people.

### 访“鲁迅故居”

    访“鲁迅故居”
    新华社记者　沈容
    “鲁迅故居”在首都西城一条偏僻的小胡同里，就是阜城门宫门口西三条二十一号。
    三年来，有多少人常常这样想，如果鲁迅先生还在，该多好！随着新中国的前进，景仰鲁迅先生的人越来越多了，怀念鲁迅先生的心情也越来越深切了。我们热望着从这个伟大的斗士学习到更多的东西，而“鲁迅故居”的本身就是很好的教材。
    管理“鲁迅故居”的同志带领我们参观了各个房间。这是一座典型的北京小四合院，是鲁迅先生借朋友的钱买来，又按照自己的意思翻造过的。
    北屋是三开间，堂屋向后院突出一间，是鲁迅先生的卧室和工作室。这间房子很小，大约只有十二平方公尺。室内的陈设由许广平先生按当时的情况布置起来。这里一切都很简单，很朴素，表明这个屋子的主人所过的是坚强辛勤的战士的生活。
    靠北面玻璃窗下放着床，这是一只木板床，上面铺着薄薄的被褥。靠东墙摆着一张小小的书桌，桌前是一张藤椅。这间屋子，就是在冬天也是不生火的，火炉在外面的堂屋里。北京的冬天这样寒冷，鲁迅先生经常在这里工作到深夜。“野草”和“呐喊”等就是在这里写成的。他有时候和衣打一个瞌睡，又埋头在煤油灯下继续工作了。他用的那盏煤油灯现在还放在桌上。他律己很严，绝不让日子随便过去。
    床的东头放着一只箱子，上面放着书。鲁迅先生偶尔躺在床上休息的时候，就随手翻阅书籍或欣赏美术作品。在鲁迅先生的生活中，什么事情也不做的那种休息是很少的。
    书桌的一头是一只书架，他把经常要用的书放在这里。屋子的西边放着一只茶几和两把椅子。鲁迅先生所热爱的青年们，就被接待到这间屋里。那时几乎每天有青年来找他。星期天最热闹了，这一批还没有走，那一批又来了。鲁迅先生虽然很忙，很珍惜自己的时间，但是他从来不拒绝这样的来客。那时，这两把椅子上和床沿上都坐满了人，香烟的烟雾充满了这间小小的屋子。鲁迅先生就在这里和青年们深谈，指导他们进行斗争和研究学问。他就是这样通过和朋友们特别是青年们的接触，紧紧地和广大群众联系，和他们息息相关。和青年们在一起的时候，他多么愉快啊，许广平先生说，在这种时候，在隔壁屋子里也常常听到他的笑声。
    桌上笔砚等用物都放得很整齐。鲁迅先生在时，一切经常是这样整齐的。什么东西都有一定的地方，用起来很方便。他把这点看得很重要，他说如果书籍和用具放错了地方，就好像药剂师放错了药品一样。
    书桌上还放着一只闹钟。鲁迅先生很守时。他工作到深夜，睡得很迟，这只钟就在第二天准时叫醒他。那时他在北京大学、女子师范大学教书，在教育部当佥事。他每天都准时上下班。
    鲁迅先生住室的南面一间是堂屋。陈设也极简朴，东边是吃饭用的一张方桌和两把椅子。靠门的地方，放着一只没有加盖的藤箱，里面放着鲁迅先生经常换洗的衣服。在冬天，这里才生一只小火炉。堂屋东西两边的房间，原来是鲁迅先生的家属住的，现在放了许多书。他的上海寓所里的书，绝大部分都已运来；连同原来在这里的，一共有一万多册。这些书都经过初步整理，人民政府已指定专人，准备编印一个书目。
    出了北屋是一个小院子，这里有鲁迅先生亲手种的丁香，现在长得很茂盛。北屋的后面还有一个后院，里面有鲁迅先生手栽的黄刺梅和其他树木。
    “秋夜”里所说的枣树，据管理“鲁迅故居”的同志说，是指后院北墙外的两棵，它们早已被砍掉了。那里现在长着一棵槐树。南屋是一大一小两间，从前是鲁迅先生的书房和会客室。这里的陈设也极简单，主要是装满了书的书架和书箱。东边墙上，挂着一张鲁迅先生的画像。书房的小桌上放着一只水晶花瓶，装在一只盒子里。这是捷克斯洛伐克文化代表团赠送的。三年来，到这里来过的国际友人很多。苏联名作家法捷耶夫等也来这里参观过。
    新中国成立以来，每年在先生逝世纪念日的时候“鲁迅故居”开放一次。开放的时候，人群川流不息。一九四九年十月十九日第一次开放，那天来瞻仰的人在一万以上。参观者的行列，长长地排满了附近的两条胡同。去年开放了一个月。今年从十月十九日起开放半个月。在不开放的时候，也每天有人带着介绍信来，要求参观。鲁迅先生一生追求着中国的新生。现在他的愿望实现了，他的战斗的精神正在日益发扬和光大。他永远活在中国人民心里。
