Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: The victory of the Vietnamese People's Army in the Nghĩa Lộ area has greatly alarmed the French colonialists. French Minister of National Defense Pleven, in a report to the French National Assembly on the 24th, while stating that France "must not be overly alarmed by this," also admitted that the fall of Nghĩa Lộ was a "heavy blow" to French prestige. A spokesperson for the French invading forces in North Vietnam also admitted: "Losing Nghĩa Lộ, located on the highway to the rice-producing region, is the most serious defeat for the French army in nine months."

When the Vietnamese People's Army besieged Nghĩa Lộ, the commander of the French invading forces in North Vietnam, Salan, flew over Nghĩa Lộ to supervise the battle, dispatched two battalions of paratroopers for reinforcements and airdropped ammunition to the besieged troops, and ordered the air force to carry out non-stop bombing for the first time in the invasion of Vietnam. The French Minister of Relations with the Associated States of Indochina, Letourneau, who was in Vietnam for "inspection," also rushed to Hanoi three days ahead of schedule, given the critical situation in Nghĩa Lộ. However, the rapidly developing offensive of the Vietnamese People's Army shattered all attempts by the French invading forces to hold the Nghĩa Lộ area. The Associated Press admitted: In this battle, the Vietnamese People's Army used "the fiercest artillery fire they have never used in the six-year Indochina War." The Vietnamese People's Army advanced so rapidly that after the Vietnamese People's Army captured Nghĩa Lộ, the communique of Salan's headquarters still said: "The fate of the French troops defending Nghĩa Lộ is unknown." It was only when French reconnaissance planes discovered the Vietnamese People's Army escorting long lines of French prisoners northward that the French colonialists learned the fate of these subordinates.

Before the Vietnamese People's Army attacked the Nghĩa Lộ area, the head of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group to Indochina, Trapnell, said on October 13th that the United States had "greatly accelerated" the shipment of military equipment to the French invading forces in Vietnam. On the same day, the Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in Indochina, Salan, said that 42,000 tons of new equipment had been shipped from the United States to Vietnam in the past four months. A United Press International dispatch from Paris on the 13th, quoting "French sources," even boasted that "the increase in American aid and the continuous expansion of loyal native troops are changing the situation." France was confident of "gaining an advantage" over the Vietnamese People's Army and therefore could withdraw some troops to aid European defense. The Nghĩa Lộ battle showed that "American aid" failed to save the failing fate of the French invading forces in Vietnam. A United Press International dispatch from Tokyo on the 25th admitted: "The situation, which appeared to be gradually stabilizing with the help of large quantities of ammunition and equipment shipped by the United States, suddenly collapsed in front of the French and Vietnamese troops."

### 越人民军义路大捷给侵越法军沉重打击  说明“美援”挽救不了法国殖民统治的失败命运

    越人民军义路大捷给侵越法军沉重打击
    说明“美援”挽救不了法国殖民统治的失败命运
    【新华社二十八日讯】越南人民军在义路地区的胜利，使法国殖民者十分恐慌。法国国防部长普利文二十四日在法国国民议会作报告时，虽然声明法国“决不能因此过分惊慌”，但是他又承认：义路的失陷是对法国威望的一个“沉重打击”。北越法国侵略军的发言人也承认：“丢失了位于通到盛产大米地区的公路上的义路，是法军九个月以来最严重的失败。”
    当越南人民军围攻义路的时候，北越法国侵略军司令李纳尔曾乘飞机到义路上空督战，派遣两营伞兵空降增援和向被围的守军空投弹药，并下令空军作侵越战争以来第一次的连夜不停的轰炸。前往越南“视察”的法国印度支那联邦成员国关系部部长勒都尔诺，鉴于义路局势危急，也提前三天赶往河内。但是，越南人民军发展迅速的攻势，粉碎了侵越法军一切盘踞义路地区的企图。美联社承认：在这次战斗中，越南人民军使用了“他们在历时六年的印度支那战争中从未使用过的猛烈炮火”。越南人民军进展如此迅速，以至在越南人民军攻下义路后，李纳尔司令部的公报还说：“防守义路的法军命运不知是怎样的。”到了法军的侦察机发现越南人民军押送长长行列的法军俘虏往北走，法国殖民者才知道了他们的这批部属们的下场。
    在越南人民军进攻义路地区以前，美国驻印度支那军事顾问团团长特拉普奈尔在十月十三日说：美国已“大大加速”运送军事装备给侵越法军。同日，法国驻印度支那法军总司令萨兰说：在过去四个月中已有四万二千吨的新装备从美国运抵越南。合众社巴黎十三日电所引的“法国人士”更大肆吹嘘说：“美援的增加和忠实的土著军队的不断扩充，正在改变局势。”法国深信对越南人民军“取得优势，因此可以撤退一些军队援助欧洲防务”。义路战役说明：“美援”并没有能够挽救侵越法军的失败命运。合众社东京二十五日电承认：“在美国所运的大量军火和装备的援助下看来是逐渐稳定的局面，突然在法、越部队面前告吹了。”
