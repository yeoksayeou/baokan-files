Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 29th: Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, head of the Indian delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, issued the following statement on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea to fight, before leaving Guangzhou to return to his country:

    On the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers joining the Korean War to protect the motherland's borders from the aggression of the American aggressors, I, on behalf of the peace-loving people of India, extend my warmest greetings to them and their great commander, General Peng Dehuai. The heroic actions of the Chinese People's Volunteers and their great victory not only saved the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from enslavement by the American imperialists, but, more importantly, shattered the American aggressors' sinister plot to further expand the Korean War in order to launch a third world war. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers inflicted a serious defeat on the American aggressors and their vassals in the Korean War, thereby safeguarding world peace. The victory of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers over the invading troops in Korea greatly encouraged the struggle of peace-loving people around the world against the warmongers. But the American imperialists still refuse to learn any lessons from their failures in Korea. They are doing everything possible to undermine the armistice negotiations and want to continue the war of aggression in Korea. I am sure their plan is doomed to failure. The peace movement in India is doing its best to help Korea achieve peace as soon as possible. I would like to assure the Chinese People's Volunteers at this solemn moment that we will redouble our efforts in this regard so that their noble mission can be completed soon.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 29th: Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, head of the Indian delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, issued the following statement before leaving Guangzhou regarding the protest against the Japanese government's order to arrest Japanese peace representatives:

    The Indian delegation participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference strongly protests the Japanese government's decision to order the arrest of several Japanese representatives participating in the conference. This decision once again proves that the Japanese government, under the orders of American imperialism, is trying to destroy the just forces of the Japanese people striving for a free and peaceful life. The people engaged in the peace movement in India have been watching the growing strength of the Japanese people with great enthusiasm, and we, the representatives, had many opportunities to meet with Japanese friends in Beijing and learned about the real situation in Japan from them. We, representing the peace-loving people of India, demand that the Japanese government revoke the arrest warrant and allow the leaders of the Japanese peace movement to return home freely to report to the people on the situation of the great Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

[This Newspaper's Report] According to Xinhua News Agency: The head of the Indian delegation, Saifuddin Kitchlew, along with representatives, observers, and staff, a total of eighteen people, left Guangzhou on the 27th, taking a route through Hong Kong to return to their country.

    印度和平代表团团长克其鲁离广州前发表谈话
    盛赞中国人民志愿军抗美援朝的伟大胜利
    并发表声明坚决抗议吉田政府下令逮捕日本和平代表
    【新华社广州二十九日电】出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的印度代表团团长、全印和平理事会主席赛福丁·克其鲁博士在离广州返国前发表关于中国人民志愿军出国二周年纪念的谈话如下：
    在中国人民志愿军为了保卫祖国边境免受美国侵略者进犯而参加朝鲜战争两周年之际，我代表爱好和平的印度人民向他们和他们的伟大的司令员彭德怀将军致以热烈的敬礼。中国人民志愿军的英雄行为和他们的伟大胜利，不仅拯救了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国免受美帝国主义者的奴役，而且，尤其重要的，粉碎了美国侵略者进一步扩大朝鲜战争以便发动第三次世界大战的罪恶阴谋。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战争中使美国侵略者及其附庸遭到严重失败，从而保障了世界和平。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军对侵朝军队的胜利，大大鼓舞了全世界爱好和平人民反对战争贩子的斗争。但是美帝国主义者仍然拒绝从他们在朝鲜的失败中记取任何教训。他们正千方百计地尽力破坏停战谈判，要想在朝鲜继续侵略战争。我确信他们的计划是注定要失败的。印度的和平运动正尽全力来帮助朝鲜尽速获得和平。我愿意在这个庄严的时候向中国人民志愿军保证：我们将在这方面加倍努力，使他们的崇高使命能够很快完成。
    【新华社广州二十九日电】出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的印度代表团团长赛福丁·克其鲁博士，在离广州前发表关于抗议日本政府下令逮捕日本和平代表的声明如下：
    参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的印度代表团坚决抗议日本政府下令逮捕参加会议的几位日本代表的决定。这个决定再一次证明了，日本政府奉美帝国主义的命令，正竭力摧毁日本人民争取自由与和平生活的正义力量。印度从事和平运动的人民一直非常热情地注视日本人民日益壮大的力量，同时我们代表们曾在北京有多次机会与日本友人会晤，从他们那里了解到日本的真实情况。我们代表印度爱好和平的人民要求日本政府撤销逮捕令，准许日本和平运动的领袖们回国自由地向人民报告伟大的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的情况。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：印度代表团团长赛福丁·克其鲁和代表、列席代表、工作人员一行十八人，二十七日离广州取道香港返国。
