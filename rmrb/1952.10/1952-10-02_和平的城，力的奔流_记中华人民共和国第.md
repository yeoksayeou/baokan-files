A City of Peace, a Torrent of Strength
—A Record of the Third National Day of the People's Republic of China in Beijing
By Our Correspondent

October 1st, the Third National Day of the People's Republic of China.

New China is laughing, the capital of New China is laughing! Tiananmen Square in the capital, the great people's leader Chairman Mao standing on Tiananmen, the foreign guests on the reviewing stand, the representatives from over thirty countries attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, are all laughing!

Under the blue sky, in the sunshine, a sea of colorful flags, a world of vibrant flowers, an endless torrent of people. They are jumping, shouting, cheering! This is a blessing for the youth of our great motherland, a paean to the glorious achievements of the motherland's revolution and construction over the past three years, a vow to defend the victorious fruits of the motherland and to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world! To say it is joyful, it is truly joyful; to say it is beautiful, it is truly beautiful; to say it is strength, it is truly strength!

Our invincible strength is not only manifested in the solemn steps of our land, air, and naval soldiers, not only in the roar of heavy tanks and the roar of jet planes, but also in the production, work, and study achievement record boards of workers, peasants, students, office staff, and cultural and art workers, and also in the singing of thousands upon thousands of innocent children wearing red scarves, in the waving of bouquets in their small hands, in their waving, smiling, and cheering to their leader, in the flocks of doves flying, and in the earth-shattering cries of "Defend Peace!"

Here, heroic model figures from all fronts of the motherland, heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers from the Korean front, representatives of people of all ethnic groups from the border regions of the motherland, and leading figures, together with foreign guests from various countries, gathered in Beijing with a common aspiration, gathered at Tiananmen Square in Beijing.

When our great people's leader Chairman Mao Zedong and his close comrades-in-arms appeared on Tiananmen, thousands upon thousands of eyes converged, and applause and cheers converged. Mutual respect and love flowed together. Tiananmen Square was seething!

What power brought them together here? What are their wishes? It is peace! Peaceful labor! Opposing war! Opposing aggression and plunder! When people released large groups of white doves into the clear sky, letting them fly all over the sky, the whole audience cheered thunderously. Foreign friends stroked the white doves that fell beside them, and the sunlight shone on the smiles on their faces.

Under the backdrop of red flags and flowers, people crowded around or held high their various labor products, models of products, descriptions of production progress, and production creations and inventions. Here are the advanced operating methods of construction workers, magnificent and beautiful buildings, including the Peace Hotel, school buildings, and factories recently built in fifty-nine days to receive representatives to the peace conference; there are the labor creations of railway workers, coal miners, steel workers, power generation workers, and papermakers; there are the grains, melons, vegetables, and other agricultural products produced by farmers. Young students carry huge models of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong and hold books in their hands. This is the great power to defend peace!

The famous Turkish poet and peace fighter Hikmet told reporters:

"What is passing through the square today is the new China, the free China, the China with a long history and culture, the China of labor. This China has transformed the old society and is transforming nature. The people of this China believe in their creativity and believe in the friendship of her friends. This China advocates world peace. This China illuminates the path to liberation for colonial and semi-colonial countries around the world. If possible, all those who have been deceived by the warmongers in the world should be allowed to see this parade. If the warmongers come to see, it is not bad either. They will see that the new China of the people is invincible. If they still have a bit of conscience and reason, they should see that China wants peace!" When the Japanese representatives remembered the bloody suppression and devastation of the May Day parade by the American imperialists and their running dogs, they were so moved that they shed tears. Yuemon Nakamura told reporters:

"The Chinese people have created such a beautiful and happy country in just three years, which makes us have to express our highest respect. We deeply know that the happiness of the Chinese people is also the happiness of the Japanese people. We hope that Japan can be liberated as early as China; we hope that the people of Asia can work harder to promote the realization of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan; and we hope that the people of the world can be happy..."

This represents the common voice of hundreds of millions of people.

As the white jade railings of Tiananmen were painted with a layer of light purple dusk, countless hardworking housewives lit the five-star red lanterns they made themselves, hanging in front of the gate. The golden and brilliant Tiananmen stands tall in the midst of thousands of lights. People were all wearing festive and brightly colored clothes, pouring into Tiananmen Square from all directions like a tide, crowding the square until it was impenetrable.

The salutes sounded, fireworks flew into the sky, bursting with colorful sparks. Shouts of surprise were constantly heard from the crowd.

The music was continuously broadcast, the happy people danced wildly, and songs resounded through the night sky of this peaceful city. This peaceful city, a city that never sleeps!

    和平的城，力的奔流
    ——记中华人民共和国第三届国庆节在北京
    本报记者
    十月一日，中华人民共和国第三届国庆日。
    新中国在欢笑，新中国的首都在欢笑！首都的天安门、站在天安门上的伟大人民领袖毛主席、观礼台上的外宾们、来自三十多国的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表们，都在欢笑！
    蓝天下，阳光中，缤纷的旗帜的海，万紫千红的鲜花的世界，无穷无尽的人的奔流。他们在跳跃、呐喊、欢呼！这是对伟大祖国的青春的祝福，是对祖国三年来革命和建设的辉煌成就的礼赞，是对保卫祖国的胜利果实、保卫远东和世界和平的誓言！说愉快，这是真正的愉快；说美丽，这是真正的美丽；说力量，这是真正的力量！
    我们的不可战胜的力量不但表现在陆、空、海军战士们的庄严的步伐上，不但表现在重型坦克的巨响和喷气式飞机的吼声里，也不但表现在工人、农民、学生、机关工作人员、文化艺术工作者的生产、工作和学习的成绩纪录牌上，而且表现在成千成万围着红领巾的天真的孩子们的歌唱里，表现在他们小手里的花束的挥舞里，表现在他们向自己领袖的招手、微笑、欢呼里，表现在一阵阵和平鸽子的纷飞里，表现在惊天动地的“保卫和平！”的呼声里！
    在这里，来自祖国各个战线上的英雄模范人物、来自朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军英雄、来自祖国边疆的各民族人民的代表与领袖人物，和来自各国的外宾，都怀着共同的愿望，汇集到北京，汇集到北京的天安门。
    当我国伟大的人民领袖毛泽东主席和他的亲密战友们出现在天安门上的时候，成千成万的眼睛汇集在一起，掌声和欢呼声汇集在一起。相互的尊敬和热爱汇流在一起。天安门广场沸腾了！
    什么力量使他们汇集到这里来呢？他们的意愿是什么呢？是和平！和平的劳动！反对战争！反对侵略和掠夺！当人们把大群大群的白鸽子放入晴空，任其漫天飞翔的时候，全场欢声雷动。外国朋友们抚摩着飞落到他们身边的白鸽，阳光照射着他们脸上的微笑。
    在满眼红旗和鲜花的掩映下，人们簇拥着或高擎着自己各种劳动的生产品、生产品的模型、生产进展的说明、生产上的创造和发明。这里有建筑工人们的先进操作法，巍峨的美丽的建筑物，包括新近以五十九天建成的接待和平会议代表的和平宾馆、学校校舍和工厂；有铁路工人、煤矿工人、钢铁工人、发电工人、造纸工人的劳动创造；有农民生产的粮食、瓜菜和其他农产物。青年学生们，抬着毛泽东选集的巨大模型，手里举着书本。这就是保卫和平的伟大力量！
    土耳其著名诗人与和平战士希克梅特对记者说：
    “今天在广场经过的是新的中国，自由的中国，有着悠久历史和文化的中国，劳动的中国。这个中国改造了旧的社会，并正在改造着自然。这个中国的人民相信自己的创造力，相信她的朋友的友谊。这个中国主张全世界和平。这个中国给世界上的殖民地半殖民地国家照亮了解放自己的道路。可能的话，应当让世界上一切受战争贩子欺骗的人都来看看这里的游行。如果有战争贩子来看，也不是很不好。他们会看到人民的新中国是不可战胜的。如果他们还有一点良心和理智，他们应该看得出中国愿意和平！”日本的代表们想起日本人民今年五一游行受美帝国主义及其走狗的血腥镇压和摧残时，一个个都激动得落了眼泪。中村玩右卫门对记者说：
    “中国人民仅仅三年就创造了这样美好的幸福的国家，这使我们不得不表示崇高的敬意。我们深深知道，中国人民的幸福也就是日本人民的幸福，我们希望日本也能像中国一样早日得到解放；希望亚洲人民能更加努力，促进全面对日媾和的实现；并希望全世界人民都得到幸福……”
    这代表着亿万人民共同的心声。
    当天安门的白玉栏杆涂上一层淡紫色的暮霭时，无数勤劳的主妇的手，点起悬挂在门前的她们手制的五星红灯。金光灿烂的天安门耸立在万家灯火中。人们都穿着节日的鲜艳的服装，像潮水一样从四面八方涌到了天安门广场，把广场挤得水泄不通。
    礼炮响了，天空飞起了焰火，迸发了五彩的火星。人群中不断传出惊喜的叫声。
    音乐连续在播送，幸福的人们在狂舞，歌声响彻了这和平城的夜空。这和平的城，不夜的城！
