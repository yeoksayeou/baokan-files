Chairman, esteemed delegates, and friends:

The people of all of China, together with the people of the capital, Beijing, extend our heartfelt and warm welcome to the delegates and friends attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. We are very pleased that you have come here, undeterred by the hardships of a long journey, for the sake of peace. This conference is a great and epic event. It offers us an opportunity to accomplish an extremely important task at a critical juncture in history. We gather here to once again fully demonstrate that humanity is certainly capable of creating peace. People all over the world eagerly await the results of our planning for the cause of peace.

This is the second international conference for the defense of peace held in China. This conference is significantly different from the previous one. Both conferences have given us excellent lessons. I would like to briefly discuss with you the situation in Shanghai in September 1933 when we fought for peace.

At that time, Japan had already forcibly occupied Northeast China and was preparing to use it as a base for a full-scale invasion of us, and then launch an attack on the Asian and Pacific regions. This piratical plundering and violence was an extremely serious threat to world peace. Therefore, it aroused angry condemnation from politicians, international organizations, trade unions, and ordinary men and women around the world. The then peace organization, the Anti-Imperialist League, particularly condemned it. The Anti-Imperialist League was a broadly based organization that was doing everything it could to stop the unprecedented offensive against the people of the world that the aggressors were clearly preparing in the 1930s. The Japanese invasion of China was the beginning of an attack on the people of Asia and the Pacific regions. The Anti-Imperialist League correctly recognized its seriousness and therefore decided to send a delegation to China.

Although the situation in China at that time was extremely tense, the Chinese branch of the Anti-Imperialist League warmly welcomed this decision. At that time, we had to not only resist the Japanese aggressors, but also fight against domestic enemies. The reactionary government, with the support of imperialist countries, was actually encouraging the aggressors. At the same time, it had launched a civil war against the people's liberation areas in southern China and was implementing a white terror against the people in other parts of the country.

You can imagine that at that time, anyone who advocated domestic unity, united resistance against foreign enemies, seeking internal peace for the Chinese people and world peace, was actually risking their lives. But despite this danger, we still carried out our work according to our plan, welcomed the delegation, and mobilized public opinion to stop the aggression. The reactionary authorities were full of hatred for us from the very beginning, and persecuted, intimidated, obstructed, and slandered us in every way. Many of those who we asked to cooperate with us were frightened away. No one dared to rent us a venue. The reactionary authorities did not allow the representatives of the Anti-Imperialist League to land. I myself had to defy the ban and go to the ship to welcome these anti-imperialist peace fighters from Europe.

We must not allow these friends to travel a long distance and gain nothing, so we decided to hold a meeting. Since we were forced to abandon open meetings, we prepared to hold secret meetings. Since we were under close surveillance, we had to maintain strict secrecy. Even I myself did not know where the meeting would be held until dawn one morning, when I was taken to a dark and desolate house in the factory district of Shanghai. The representatives could only go there one by one. Some of them even went there secretly in the middle of the night. When I arrived, everyone, including the foreign guests, was sitting on the floor, because the only furniture in the room was a small table for the secretary. We were actually conducting reports and discussions in whispers. This is how we discussed peace in 1933.

Since then, we have made great progress. Initially, the Anti-Imperialist League represented 30 million people. Now, the movement initiated by the World Peace Council to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact has been signed by more than 603 million people. Comparing the two, doesn't this prove that the general public's demand for international cooperation has greatly increased? Doesn't this show that the ranks of those demanding peace are rapidly growing, moving forward, and becoming a dominant force in the world?

Let's compare the circumstances of the meetings between 1933 and today! Now, when peace representatives come to China, they are treated as honored guests. When you walk into the venue, the eyes of all Chinese people are on you. For the cause of peace, all possible conveniences have been prepared for you. Reports and discussions will be transmitted by radio and newspapers, reaching even the smallest villages. The Chinese people's movement to defend peace, which has already reached its climax, will now set off a new climax.

Dear friends, the very fact that we can gather here today marks a major development in the cause of peace in human history. For the vast and diverse populations living in the Asian and Pacific regions or even further afield, this has glorious significance. China's example has further strengthened their grasp of a fundamental truth: national independence and peace emerge from the same struggle.

At the present stage of world history, people will no longer be deceived. In the minds of the people, what is beneficial to imperialism and what is beneficial to the oppressed people has been clearly demarcated. The struggle for national independence and the demand for world peace are increasingly closely linked. The oppressed people ask: "Who exactly wants war?" The answer is before their eyes—those countries that build military bases in their territories and station foreign troops to suppress them. They ask: "Who exactly is destroying the many steels, oils, fabrics, and foods produced by our labor and urgently needed for our lives?" The answer is also before their eyes—those countries that invade their territories, cruelly plunder their national wealth, and at most give them back a few breadcrumbs. "Who exactly makes mothers heartbroken and weeping rivers of tears for their children?" The answer is even more obvious—still those countries that separate mothers and children and cruelly send young people to the slaughterhouses of war.

These questions and answers lead people to a realization. This realization merges the demands for independence and peace into one.

For example, the people of Latin America have refused to participate in the United States' aggression in Korea. They have openly and firmly warned their government leaders: "No interference in Korea!" Several countries have had to cancel their agreements with the United States in this regard. The determination of the people to continue along this path has been manifested in the "Montevideo Conference". This was a conference convened by the people of North and South America despite the opposition of the warmongers, and the circumstances of the conference were very similar to the past situation in China that I mentioned earlier.

Throughout the Asian and Pacific regions, we can find many similar examples that prove the persistence and determination to fight for national independence and peace. The preparation for this conference, in particular, proves this point.

This trend is so significant that everyone can see it, even those who fear losing the value of their gold and stocks. This makes them even more afraid and more frantic. They struggle desperately to stop these changes that are beneficial to national independence and world peace. They intensify the implementation of all plans to enhance domestic and foreign control and plunder. They rudely disregard proposals and intentions for genuine consultation and good neighborly coexistence. Since June 1950, the imperialist countries, headed by the US ruling clique, have launched all-out offensives. They cruelly suppressed the liberation movements in the Near East, the Middle East, and Africa. They have increased economic and political pressure on Latin America and other regions. In Korea, they have moved from talking about and planning aggression to the stage of military attack. They forcibly occupied China's Taiwan and are openly preparing to invade our mainland. In Vietnam and Malaya, they have also intensified military action.

It is no accident that the imperialists use extremely vicious means for every military action in the Far East. They have a fixed pattern: complete contempt for the people of Asian countries. Their intention is to destroy everything, to destroy the residents of these places and their culture as much as possible, in order to run rampant and plunder arbitrarily. Racism and genocide have become their creed in these places, just as in their own countries.

Although they have implemented this bloody policy, the US ruling class and their partners have suffered defeats on every front. They are beginning to recognize a fact that modern history has proven: the perpetrators of fascism and its methods are inescapable. They are bound to encounter opposition from the broad mass movements and powerful people's armies loyal to the motherland and the cause of peace. Those who get rich in war must be held accountable for their crimes on the battlefield. In the hearts of people all over the world, their actions are condemned as "dirty wars." Even in their own countries, their calls for force have caused anxiety among the people; they are increasingly finding it difficult to drive the people to fight for them. Look at the number of American aviation pilots who refuse to fly in Korea, and look at the number of soldiers who deliberately injure themselves at the front. The French government has to hire thugs from the old Nazi stormtroopers or unemployed youths from West Germany to fight in Vietnam. The British people are most unwilling to send their sons to Malaya, so the British government has to recruit underage youths overseas to replenish its troops.

Those who make war their business do not seem to be able to appreciate the ominous signs foreshadowed by this situation. They cannot understand that every act of barbarity will accelerate their doomed fate. For example, in Korea, the American army's mad destruction is worse than Hitler's, but they still feel it is not enough, and they want to far surpass Hitler in the business of destroying an entire nation. In Korea and Northeast China, they have consistently used the most brutal weapons, conducting germ warfare, using germs to harm people and livestock, poisoning water sources, and damaging crops. Because of this behavior, according to international laws and conventions, the US government has further made itself the main war criminal.

In Vietnam and Malaya, the crimes committed by the US's servant states are equally heinous. They use chemical weapons in the air, deliberately destroying crops. Entire villages are destroyed, and residents are driven into concentration camps. The consequences of these mad acts of violence are the same as in Korea. The people are resisting more stubbornly. The ugliness of the war and the viciousness of the war conspirators have been exposed without exception; every crime they commit brings them closer to extinction.

Germ warfare, mad destruction, and bestial massacres have aroused the anger of all good and upright people. In every country, it has caused deep concern and widespread resentment. From this, it can be seen that the US government and its accomplices have isolated themselves from peace-loving people all over the world and suffered a serious political defeat. This failure will have long-term effects. The people will never forget it.

There are some other things that the people will never forget and forgive. These include the US ruling clique's continued occupation and rearmament of Japan and West Germany. The militarists of Germany and Japan have left a permanent hatred in our hearts. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that when they pick up their weapons again, we fear for the future of peace. It is not difficult to understand that when we know that large numbers of war criminals have been released, military and fascist organizations are still preserved, and huge enterprises have been returned intact to the monopolists who promoted fascism and war, we worry about the security of the world.

Obviously, all this is to prepare for further military adventures. It is also obvious that those bloodthirsty war merchants think that the people will blindly accept everything. But they have miscalculated again. This conference proves this point. People who cherish peace will never accept the conspiracy of rearming the revanchist elements of Germany and Japan. Most of the people in Germany and Japan will not accept this conspiracy either. They demand to wash away the shame of the past, establish a new life, and regain the respect of the people of the world. In these two countries, workers and people's organizations have held many large-scale demonstrations against rearmament, against the treaties forced upon them by the United States, and against using their industrial power for war production. There are strong peace movements in both countries. The people of the world wholeheartedly support the struggle of the German and Japanese people for peace.

Dear friends: We must strive forward to ensure that this and every peace effort achieves victory. Although our peace movement, because of its vast scale and excellent organization, has generated tremendous power, although the ranks of our peace movement are united and have the resolute action of hundreds of millions of people, we must maintain the momentum we already have. We must work harder to make our sincerity in cooperating with all who desire peace more fruitful. In terms of the scope of the peace movement, there are still areas that have not been reached, and there are some blank areas that are requesting to participate in this greatest struggle of mankind. Moreover, there are many such areas in our region. In this regard, of course, there are many difficult problems to be solved, but these difficulties are easier to overcome compared to the disasters of war. Moreover, we already have a powerful guarantee of final victory, that is, the vast majority of people in the world demand peace. They are absolutely unwilling to let their blood and sweat be used to cast weapons of murder to destroy other people and then turn around and destroy themselves. They want to have food to eat, comfortable houses to live in, good clothes to wear, and they and their children want to enjoy culture. Women suffer the most from the disasters of war. In order to protect their children, Asian women will stand with peace-loving people all over the world to resolutely defend peace. They know that they can only get what they want when world peace is achieved.

I believe that our work should revolve around several urgent central issues:

Mobilize the people to demand a cessation of all wars currently underway and to seek peaceful solutions through genuine consultation. This, of course, includes the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya.

Mobilize the people to demand that all countries that have participated in the war legally end the previous war in accordance with international agreements, and thereby guarantee to the whole world that the past hostile countries will work for peace and live for peace in the future.

Mobilize the people to demand the prohibition of the use of all weapons of mass slaughter and declare these weapons illegal; those who have used such weapons in the current war must be tried in accordance with international law.

Mobilize the people to demand the removal of all obstacles to international trade and cultural exchanges, and to promote full trade and cultural exchanges between people of all countries for the benefit of people all over the world.

Mobilize the people to strive for moral conditions conducive to peaceful coexistence, to strive for healthy air to eliminate hatred and war, and to build friendship and understanding among people all over the world.

These should be our working goals. If we can accomplish our task within this scope, we will further contribute to world security. I have full confidence that we will successfully achieve our goals.

Long live the people of the world!

Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

Long live world peace!

    动员起来！为亚洲、太平洋区域与全世界的和平而斗争！
    ——在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议开幕式上的开幕词
    开幕式执行主席  
    宋庆龄
    主席、各位代表和朋友们：
    全中国的人民，和首都北京的人民在一起，向出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表们、朋友们，表示衷心的热烈的欢迎。您们为了和平，不辞长途跋涉的辛劳，来到此地，我们感到非常高兴。这次会议是一个伟大的、具有史诗意义的事件。它给予我们一个机会，使我们能够在历史的紧要关头完成一个极端重要的任务。我们在这里聚集一堂，要再一次充分地证明，人类是一定能创造和平的。世界各地的人民都热切地期待着我们为和平事业筹划的结果。
    这是在中国举行的第二次保卫和平的国际会议。这次会议比起前次会议来，有着显著的不同。这两次会议都给了我们极好的经验教训。我想把一九三三年九月间我们在上海为和平而斗争的情况，和各位简单谈一下。
    那时候，日本已经强占了中国的东北，而且准备用它作为基地向我们全面进攻，然后向亚洲及太平洋区域发动进攻。这种海盗式的掠夺与暴行，对世界和平是一种极其严重的威胁。因此它引起了全世界的政治家、国际团体、工会和一般男女的忿怒指责。当时的和平组织，反帝大同盟，特别加以谴责。反帝大同盟是一个成员很广泛的组织，它正在竭尽全力进行斗争，来制止侵略者在三十年代中显然已准备着的向世界人民的空前大进攻。日本进犯中国是向亚洲及太平洋区域人民进攻的开始。反帝大同盟正确地认识到它的严重性，因此决定派遣一个代表团到中国来。
    虽然中国当时的形势极端紧张，但是反帝大同盟中国支部却热诚地欢迎这个决定。当时我们不仅要抵抗日本侵略者，而且还要对国内的敌人作斗争。反动政府在帝国主义国家支持之下，实际上是在怂恿着侵略者。同时它已对中国南部的人民解放区发动内战，并且向全国其他地区的人民施行白色恐怖。
    你们可以想像，在那时候，谁要主张国内团结、一致抵抗外敌，谋求中国人民内部的和平与世界的和平，实际上就得冒生命的危险。但是尽管面对着这种危险，我们依然按照我们的计划进行工作，欢迎代表团，并且动员舆论制止侵略。反动当局一开始就对我们仇恨万分，从各方面向我们进行迫害、恐吓、阻挠和诽谤。我们请求来与我们合作的人，许多都被吓走了。没有人敢把会场租给我们。反动当局不准反帝大同盟的代表们登陆。我本人不得不违抗禁令，到船上去欢迎这些欧洲来的反帝的和平战士。
    我们决不能使这些朋友长途跋涉而一无所获，我们决定召开一次会议。我们既然被迫放弃公开会议，就准备举行秘密会议。由于我们正处于严密监视之下，我们就必须严守秘密。连我自己都不晓得举行会议的地点在那里，直到一天早晨的黎明时候，我被带到上海工厂区的一幢阴暗凄凉的房子里。代表们只能一个一个地单独前往。甚至还有一部分人是在深夜里偷偷地到那里去的。当我到达时，每一个人，连外宾在内，都坐在地板上，因为房间里唯一的家具是供秘书用的一张小棹子。我们实际上是在低声耳语之中进行报告和讨论的。这就是我们在一九三三年讨论和平的情况。
    自从那时以来，我们已有了很大的进展。当初反帝大同盟代表着三千万人民。现在由世界和平理事会所发起要求五大国缔结和平公约的运动，签名者已有六亿零三百万以上的人民。把两者比较一下，这不是证明了一般人民对于争取国际合作的要求，已经大为增强了吗？这不是说明了要求和平的队伍正在迅速地壮大，向前迈进，成为世界上一支占优势的力量了吗？
    再就会议举行的情况，把一九三三年和今天比较
    一下吧！现在，当和平代表们莅临中国，他们受到上宾的招待。当你们走进会场时，全中国人民的眼睛都望着你们。为了和平事业，一切可能办到的方便都给你们准备好了。报告和讨论都会由无线电和报纸传达出去，连最小的村庄都达到。中国人民保卫和平运动，本来已经达到高潮，现在还要掀起更新的高潮。
    亲爱的朋友们，今天我们能在这里聚集一堂，这件事实本身就标志着人类历史中的和平事业的重大发展。对于居住在亚洲及太平洋区域甚或更远地方的广大而不同地区的人民群众，这是有着辉煌的意义的。中国的榜样，使他们更坚定地掌握了一个基本真理：民族独立与和平是从同一个斗争中产生出来的。
    在世界历史的现阶段，人民不会再受欺骗了。在人民的心目中，什么是有利于帝国主义的，什么是有利于被压迫人民的，已经界线分明。争取民族独立的斗争和对于世界和平的要求，日益密切地连系起来了。被压迫的人民问：“究竟谁要战争？”答案就摆在他们眼前——就是那些在他们的领土上建筑军事基地、驻扎外国军队来镇压他们的国家。他们问：“究竟谁在破坏我们劳力所生产和我们生活所迫切需要的那许多钢铁、石油、布匹和食物呢？”答案也摆在他们眼前——就是那些侵入他们的国土、残酷地掠夺他们的国家财富而最多只给还他们一点面包屑的国家。“究竟谁使母亲们为她们的孩子而伤心痛哭、泪流成河呢？”答案也是再明显不过的——还是那些使母子骨肉分离、把青年人残酷地送到战争屠场上去的国家。
    这些问题和答案使人们得到一种认识。这种认识把争取独立与和平的要求熔合为一。
    举一个例子：拉丁美洲的人民已经拒绝参加美国在朝鲜的侵略。他们已经公开地、坚决地警告他们的政府领袖：“不许干涉朝鲜！”有几个国家已经不得不取消它们和美国在这方面的协议。人民继续沿着这条道路前进的决心，已经在“蒙得维的亚会议”中表现出来了。这是南北美洲人民不顾战争贩子的反对而召开的一次会议，会议召开时的环境很像我前面所提到的中国过去的情况。
    在整个亚洲及太平洋区域，我们可以找到许多相似的例子，证明争取民族独立与和平的坚持与决心。这次会议的筹备工作，尤其证明了这一点。
    这种趋势已经非常显著，谁都看得出来，甚至那些唯恐失去他们的黄金和股票价值的人们，也都看到了。这使他们更加害怕，更加疯狂。他们拚命地挣扎，企图阻止这些对各民族独立及世界和平有利的变动。他们加紧推行增强国内外控制与掠夺的全部计划。他们对于真诚协商、睦邻共居的建议与意图，竟粗暴地置之不理。自从一九五○年六月以来，以美国统治集团为首的帝国主义国家发动了各方面进攻。他们残酷地镇压近东、中东与非洲的解放运动。他们对拉丁美洲以及其他地区增强了经济和政治压力。在朝鲜，他们从谈论与策划侵略进到武力进攻的阶段。他们强占中国的台湾，并且公开准备侵略我们大陆。在越南和马来亚，他们也加紧军事行动。
    帝国主义者对于远东的每一个军事行动，都使用着穷凶极恶的手段，并不是偶然的。他们已有了一套固定的方式：完全蔑视亚洲各国的人民。他们的意图是毁灭一切，把这些地方的居民和他们的文化尽量毁灭，以便横行无阻，恣意掠夺。种族主义和灭种政策成为他们在这些地方推行的信条，正如在他们本国一样。
    虽然他们实行了这种血腥政策，美国统治阶级和他们的伙伴还是在每一条战线上都遭遇失败。他们开始认识到近代历史已经证明的一个事实：法西斯主义与方法的施行者，是罪无可逃的。他们必然要碰到忠于祖国与和平事业的广大民众运动与强大人民军队的反对。在战争中发财的人，必须对他们在战场上的罪行负责。在全世界人民的心目中，他们的行动被斥为“肮脏的战争”。甚至在他们国内，他们鼓吹武力的叫嚣也引起人民的焦虑；他们越来越感到要驱使人民为他们作战的困难。请看一看拒绝在朝鲜飞行的美国航空驾驶员的数目吧，看一看在前线故意伤害自己身体的士兵的数目吧。法国政府不得不雇用旧日纳粹挺进队的暴徒或西德的失业青年到越南去作战。英国人民最不愿意把他们的儿子送到马来亚去，因而英国政府不得不在海外征募未成年的青年来补充兵额。
    那些以战争为业的人，似乎还不能体会到这种情形所预示的凶兆。他们不能了解，每一次的野蛮暴行，会更加速注定他们没落的命运。例如在朝鲜，美国军队的疯狂破坏，比之希特勒有过之而无不及，但是他们还觉得不够，他们在毁灭整个民族这一勾当上，还要远超过希特勒。他们在朝鲜和中国的东北，一贯地使用最残酷的武器，进行细菌战争，用病菌来伤害人民和牲畜，在水源投毒并损害农作物，由于这种行为，按照国际法律和公约，美国政府已经进一步使它自己成为主要的战犯了。
    在越南和马来亚，美国的仆从国家所犯的罪行也同样地恶毒。他们在空中使用化学武器，故意毁坏庄稼。整个村庄被消灭，居民们被赶进集中营。这些疯狂的暴行所产生的结果，和在朝鲜的暴行是一样的。人民更加顽强地进行反抗。战争的丑恶和战争阴谋家的狠毒已经暴露无遗；他们所犯的每一件罪行，都使他们更接近于灭亡。
    细菌战、疯狂破坏和兽性屠杀激起了所有善良正直人民的愤怒。在每一个国家里，都引起了深切的关心和普遍的愤恨。由此可见，美国政府和它的帮凶们已经自绝于全世界爱好和平的人民，并且遭到严重的政治失败。这种失败将会有长远的影响。人民是永远不会忘却的。
    还有一些其他事情，也是人民永久不能忘却和饶恕的。其中包括美国统治集团的继续占领与重新武装日本和西德。德国和日本的军国主义者已经在我们内心深处留下了永久的仇恨。因此，不难了解，当他们重新拿起武器的时候，我们就为和平的前途忧惧。不难了解，当我们知道大批战犯被释放、军事和法西斯组织依然保存下来，庞大的企业又原封不动地交还给推行法西斯主义与战争的垄断资本家的时候，我们就替世界的安全担心。
    很明显的，所有这些是为了准备进一步的军事冒险。也很明显的，那些嗜杀成性的战争贩子，以为人民会盲目地接受一切。但是他们又一次地估计错了。我们这次会议就证明了这一点。珍爱和平的人们，决不会接受重新武装德国和日本的复仇主义分子的阴谋诡计的。德国和日本大部分人民也不会接受这种阴谋诡计的。他们要求洗刷过去的耻辱，建立新的生活，重新得到世界人民的尊重。在这两个国家中，工人和人民的团体曾经举行许多大规模的示威游行，反对重新武装，反对美国强迫签订的条约，反对把他们的工业力量用于战争生产。这两个国家里都有强大的和平运动。全世界人民都衷心地支持德国和日本人民争取和平的斗争。
    亲爱的朋友们：我们必须努力前进，保证这次和每一个和平的努力都得到胜利。虽然我们的和平运动，由于它的广大规模和优良组织，已经产生了巨大的力量，虽然我们和平运动的队伍是团结一致的，而且有好多万万人民的坚决行动，但是我们必须好好地保持现在已有的动力。我们必须更加努力，使我们愿意与一切希望和平的人们合作的诚意获得更大的成果。就和平运动的范围来说，目前还有地区尚未达到，还有一些空白区正在要求参加人类这一最伟大的斗争。而且在我们的区域中，就有很多这类的地区。在这方面，当然有许多困难问题须待解决，但这些困难与战争的灾祸相比，究竟是比较容易克服的。何况我们已经有了得到最后胜利的有力保证，那就是世界上极大多数人民都要求和平。他们决不愿意让他们的血汗被用于铸造杀人武器，用来毁灭其他人民，再转回来毁灭他们自己。他们要有饭吃，有安适的房子住，有好的衣服穿，他们自己和儿女都要享受文化。妇女所受战争的灾害最深，为了保卫她们的孩子，亚洲的妇女将和全世界爱好和平的人们在一起，坚决地保卫和平。他们知道，只有世界和平实现了，他们才能获得他们所要的这些东西。
    我认为，我们的工作应该环绕在几个迫切的中心问题上：
    动员人民，要求停止目前正在进行的一切战争，并且用真诚协商的方法谋得和平解决。这当然包括在朝鲜、越南和马来亚进行的战争。
    动员人民，要求所有曾经参加战争的国家根据国际协定，合法地结束以前的战争，并以此向全世界保证，过去的敌对国家，今后将为和平而工作、为和平而生活。
    动员人民，要求禁止使用一切集体屠杀的武器并宣布这些武器为非法；对于在目前战争中曾经使用这种武器的人们，必须按照国际公法加以审判。
    动员人民，要求扫除对于国际贸易与文化交流的一切障碍，并且为了全世界人民的利益，促成各国人民间贸易和文化方面的充分交流。
    动员人民，争取有助于和平共居的道德条件，争取健康空气，以消除仇恨与战争，建立全世界人民之间的友爱与谅解。
    这些应该是我们的工作目标。如果我们能够在这个范围内完成我们的任务，我们对于世界安全就会有进一步的贡献。我有充分的信心，相信我们一定会胜利地达到我们的目标。
    世界人民万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
