Nakamura Gan'emon first thanked the actors, saying: As an actor, I was deeply moved after watching the performance of "The White Haired Girl." He said that the powerful acting skills and genuine emotions of the Chinese actors demonstrated that they had understood Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thoughts. On behalf of the Japanese film industry, theater industry, and all Japanese actors who are fighting for peace, I present flowers to the Chinese actors. He pointed to the flowers and said: "These flowers represent the Japanese actors' desire to join hands with you and continue to work hard to put on better performances for the struggle for peace." After his speech, he shook hands with the actors one by one and embraced the actor who played Dachun, at which point the applause of the entire audience was deafening. He then shook hands with every actor on the stage, and many attendees were even moved to tears.
