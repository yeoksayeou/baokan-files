I have received all the documents from the discussion conference on the evaluation of the draft of the textbook on political economy, including: "Suggestions for Improving the Draft of the Textbook on Political Economy," "Suggestions for Eliminating Errors and Inaccuracies in the Draft," and "Materials on the Explanation of Controversial Issues."

Regarding all these materials, as well as the draft of the textbook, I believe the following opinions must be presented.

I. On the Nature of Economic Laws Under the Socialist System

Some comrades deny the objective nature of scientific laws, especially the objective nature of the laws of political economy under the socialist system. They deny that the laws of political economy reflect the laws of processes that are not subject to human will. They believe that, due to the special role assigned to the Soviet state by history, the Soviet state and its leaders can abolish existing political economic laws, "establish" new laws, and "create" new laws.

These comrades are greatly mistaken. Obviously, they have confused two different things: one is scientific laws, which reflect objective processes in nature or society that are not subject to human will; the other is decrees issued by the government, which are created by human will and have only legal force. But these two things cannot be confused in any way.

Marxism regards scientific laws—whether they are laws of natural science or political economy—as the reflection of objective processes that are not subject to human will. People can discover these laws, understand them, study them, consider them in their actions, utilize them to benefit society, but people cannot change or abolish these laws, especially not create or establish new scientific laws.

Does this mean, for example, that the results of the action of natural laws, that is, the results of the action of natural forces, are absolutely unavoidable, and that the destructive power of nature appears in any place and at any time with spontaneous, uncontrollable, and uninfluenced-by-humans force? No, that is not the meaning. Of course, in astronomy, geology, and other similar processes, even if people have already recognized their development laws, they are indeed powerless to influence them. If these processes are excluded, then in many other cases, people are not powerless to influence natural processes. In all such cases, if people recognize natural laws, consider them, rely on them, and are good at applying and utilizing them, they can limit the scope of their action, guide the destructive power of nature in another direction, and turn the destructive power of nature into a benefit for society.

Let us take one example from many. In ancient times, floods, floods, and the destruction of houses and crops caused by them were considered unavoidable disasters, and people were powerless to stop them. However, with the passage of time and the development of human knowledge, when people learned to build dikes and hydroelectric stations, they were able to prevent what was previously considered unavoidable water disasters from happening to society. Not only that, people also learned to stop the destructive power of nature, so to speak, to tame it, and turn water power into a benefit for society, using water to irrigate fields and obtain power.

Does this mean that people thereby abolished natural laws, scientific laws, and created new natural laws, new scientific laws? No, that is not the meaning. The issue is that the entire process of preventing the destructive effects of water power and utilizing it for the benefit of society does not violate, change, or destroy scientific laws, nor does it create new scientific laws. On the contrary, this entire process is realized precisely according to natural laws, scientific laws, because any violation of natural laws, even the slightest violation, will only cause confusion in things and destroy the process.

The same must be said about the laws of economic development, about the laws of political economy—whether it is the capitalist period or the socialist period. Here, as in natural science, the laws of economic development are objective laws that reflect economic development processes that are not subject to human will. People can discover these laws, understand them, rely on them, utilize them to benefit society, guide the destructive effects of certain laws in another direction, limit the scope of their action, and give other laws that are struggling to open up a path for themselves a wide scope for action. But people cannot eliminate these laws or create new economic laws.

One characteristic of political economy is that its laws, unlike the laws of natural science, are not immutable; most of the laws of political economy are operative in a certain historical period, after which they give way to new laws. However, the original laws are not abolished but lose their effectiveness due to the emergence of new economic conditions and retreat from the stage, giving way to new laws, which are not created by human will but arise on the basis of new economic conditions.

Some people cite Engels' "Anti-Dühring," citing his formula: with the abolition of capitalism and the socialization of the means of production, people will gain the power to control their means of production, gain freedom from the oppression of social economic relations, and become the "masters" of their own social life. Engels calls this freedom "recognized necessity." What does "recognized necessity" mean? This means that after people recognize objective laws ("necessity"), they will consciously use these laws to benefit society. Therefore, Engels says in the same place:

"The laws of people's own social actions, which until now have stood in opposition to people as alien, ruling laws of nature, will be applied by people with perfect knowledge, and will thus be subjected to their rule."

It is clear that Engels' formula is not favorable to those who believe that existing economic laws can be abolished and new economic laws can be created under the socialist system. On the contrary, this formula is not to abolish economic laws but to recognize them and be good at using them.

Some people say that economic laws have a spontaneous character, that the actions of these laws are unavoidable, and that society is powerless before them. This is incorrect. This is to idolize the laws and make oneself a slave to the laws. It has been proven: society is not powerless before the laws. After society recognizes economic laws, relies on them, it can limit the scope of their action, utilize them to benefit society, and "control" them, just as in the case of natural forces and their laws, as shown in the example of river floods.

Some people cite the special role of the Soviet government in the construction of socialism, as if this role makes it possible for the Soviet government to abolish existing economic development laws and "establish" new economic development laws. This is also incorrect.

The special role of the Soviet government is explained by two circumstances: first, the Soviet government does not replace one form of exploitation with another form of exploitation, as in previous revolutions, but abolishes any exploitation; second, due to the lack of any ready-made socialist economic germs within the country, the Soviet government had to create new socialist economic forms on what can be called "virgin soil."

This task was undoubtedly difficult and complex, unprecedented. However, the Soviet government has gloriously completed this task. But it completed this task not because it supposedly abolished existing economic laws and "established" new economic laws, but only because it relied on the economic law that production relations must correspond to the nature of the productive forces. Previously, our productive forces, especially in industry, were social in nature, but the form of ownership was private, capitalist. The Soviet government, based on the economic law that production relations must correspond to the nature of the productive forces, socialized the means of production, making them the property of all the people, thereby abolishing the system of exploitation and creating a socialist economic form. Without this law, without relying on this law, the Soviet government would not have been able to complete its task.

The economic law that production relations must correspond to the nature of the productive forces has long been struggling to open up a path for itself in capitalist countries. It has not yet opened up a path for itself, has not yet gained a wide scope for action, because it has encountered the extremely strong resistance of the decaying forces of society. Here, we encounter another characteristic of economic laws. In natural science, the discovery and application of new laws proceed more or less smoothly; on the contrary, in the field of economics, the discovery and application of new laws that touch the interests of the decaying forces of society encounter the extremely strong resistance of these forces. Therefore, there must be social forces capable of overcoming this resistance. In our country, such a force was found, and its form was the alliance of the working class and the peasantry, which constitutes the absolute majority of society. Such a force has not yet been found in other countries, that is, capitalist countries. The Soviet government was able to crush the old social forces, and the economic law that production relations must correspond to the nature of the productive forces was able to gain a fully broad scope for action in our country, the secret of which lies in this.

Some people say that the necessity of planned (proportional) development of the national economy makes it possible for the Soviet government to abolish existing economic laws and create new economic laws. This is completely incorrect. It is not possible to confuse our annual plans and five-year plans with the objective economic law of planned development of the national economy. The law of planned development of the national economy arises as the antithesis of the law of competition and anarchic production under the capitalist system. It arises on the basis of the socialization of the means of production after the law of competition and anarchic production loses its effectiveness. It acts because only on the basis of the economic law of planned development of the national economy can the socialist national economy function. This means that the law of planned development of the national economy enables our planning agencies to plan social production correctly. However, it is not possible to confuse possibility with reality. These are two different things. To turn this possibility into reality, it is necessary to study this economic law, to master it, to learn to apply it with complete knowledge, and to formulate plans that fully reflect the requirements of this law. It cannot be said that our annual plans and five-year plans fully reflect the requirements of this economic law.

Some people say that some economic laws, including the law of value, operating in our socialist system have been "transformed" or even "radically transformed" on the basis of a planned economy. This is also incorrect. Laws cannot be "transformed," especially not "radically transformed." If it were possible to transform laws, then it would also be possible to abolish laws and replace them with other laws. The theory of "transforming" laws is the residue of the incorrect formula of "abolishing" and "establishing" laws. Although the formula of transforming economic laws has long been prevalent among us, it is necessary to discard this formula for the sake of accuracy. It is possible to limit the scope of action of this or that economic law, to prevent their destructive effects (if any), but it is not possible to "transform" or "abolish" laws.

Therefore, when people talk about "conquering" natural forces or economic forces, about "controlling" them, etc., they do not mean that people can "abolish" scientific laws or "establish" scientific laws. On the contrary, they only mean to say that people can discover laws, understand them, master them, learn to use them with complete knowledge, utilize them to benefit society, and thus conquer them, gain control over them.

Thus, under the socialist system, the laws of political economy are objective laws that reflect the laws of economic life processes that are not subject to our will. Those who deny this principle actually deny science, and denying science is to deny any possibility of foresight, and thus to deny the possibility of leading economic life.

Perhaps someone will say that what is said here is correct and well-known, but there is nothing new in it, and therefore it is not worth the time to restate well-known truths. Of course, there is nothing new here, but if one thinks that it is not worth the time to restate some truths we are familiar with, then that is wrong. The point is that every year thousands of young new cadres approach our leadership core, full of enthusiasm to help us, eager to show themselves, but they have not received sufficient Marxist education, do not know many truths we are familiar with, and have to grope in the dark. The great achievements of the Soviet government amaze them, the extraordinary success of the Soviet system has made them dizzy, and they think that the Soviet government is "omnipotent," is "effortless," that it can abolish scientific laws and establish new laws. What should we do with these comrades? How should we educate them in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism? I think that systematically repeating so-called "well-known" truths and patiently explaining these truths is one of the best methods for Marxist education of these comrades.

II. On the Issue of Commodity Production Under the Socialist System

Some comrades assert that after the Party seized power in our country and nationalized the means of production, it was wrong to retain commodity production. They believe that the Party should have eliminated commodity production at that time. On this point, they cite Engels' words as proof:

"Once society has taken possession of the means of production, then commodity production and the domination of the product over the producer will both disappear."

(See "Anti-Dühring")

These comrades are greatly mistaken.

Let us analyze Engels' formula. Engels' formula cannot be considered entirely clear, because it does not specify whether it refers to society taking possession of all the means of production or only a part of the means of production, that is, whether all the means of production are transferred to public ownership or only a part of the means of production. This means that Engels' formula can be understood in one way or another.

In another place in "Anti-Dühring," Engels speaks of taking possession of "all the means of production," of taking possession of "the entire sum of the means of production." This means that Engels, in his own formula, refers not to the nationalization of a part of the means of production, but to the nationalization of all the means of production, that is, not only the means of production in industry, but also the means of production in agriculture.

It is clear that Engels is referring to those countries where, not only in industry, but also in agriculture, capitalism and the concentration of production have developed to such an extent that it is possible to expropriate all the means of production in the country and transfer them to public ownership. Therefore, Engels believes that in such countries, in addition to the socialization of all the means of production, it is also necessary to eliminate commodity production. This is, of course, correct.

By the end of the 19th century, at the time of the publication of "Anti-Dühring," there was only one country, Britain, where the development of capitalism and the concentration of production in industry and agriculture had reached such a height that, once the proletariat seized power, it would be possible to expropriate all the means of production in the country and transfer them to public ownership, and to eliminate commodity production.

Here, I set aside the question of the significance of foreign trade, which occupies a huge share in the national economy of Britain. I believe that only after studying this question can the final solution to the question of the fate of commodity production in Britain after the proletariat seizes power and nationalizes all the means of production be found.

Even, not only at the end of the 19th century, but also at present, there is no country where the development of capitalism and the concentration of production in agriculture have reached the level we see in Britain. As for the other countries, although there is capitalist development in the countryside, there are still a considerable number of middle and small private producers, whose fate should be determined when the proletariat seizes power.

But here there is a question: if in a certain country, as in our country, when the proletariat seizes power and the favorable conditions for overthrowing capitalism are already in place, capitalism in industry has concentrated the means of production to such an extent that they can be expropriated and transferred to social ownership, but agriculture, although there is capitalist development, is still so scattered due to the large number of middle and small private producers that it is not possible to raise the question of expropriating these producers, then what should the proletariat and its party do?

Engels' formula does not give an answer to this question. But this formula should not answer this question, because it is based on another question, and this other question is: what should be the fate of commodity production after the socialization of all the means of production?

Therefore, if it is not all the means of production that can be socialized, but only a part of the means of production, and the favorable conditions for the proletariat to seize power are already in place, then what should be done? Should the proletariat seize power, and after seizing power, should commodity production be immediately eliminated?

Of course, it is not possible to call the opinions of some poor Marxists an answer, who believe that under such conditions, one should refuse to seize power and wait until capitalism bankrupts millions of middle and small producers, turns them into hired laborers, and concentrates the means of production in agriculture. Obviously, Marxists cannot choose such an "exit" if they do not want to disgrace themselves.

It is also not possible to take another poor Marxist opinion as an answer, who believes that perhaps one should seize power and begin to expropriate the middle and small producers in the countryside, socialize their means of production. Marxists cannot take this absurd and criminal path, because such a path would destroy any possibility of the victory of the proletarian revolution and would throw the peasants into the camp of the enemies of the proletariat for a long time.

Lenin gave an answer to this question in his works on the "Grain Tax" and the famous "Cooperative Plan."

Lenin's answer can be summarized as follows:

(A) Do not miss the favorable conditions for seizing power, the proletariat should seize power, do not wait until capitalism bankrupts millions of middle and small individual producers;

(B) Expropriate the means of production in industry and transfer them to public ownership;

(C) As for the middle and small individual producers, they should gradually be united into production cooperatives, that is, united into large-scale agricultural enterprises, collective farms;

(D) Develop industry in every way, establish a modern technological base for large-scale production for collective farms, and do not expropriate collective farms, but on the contrary, supply them with first-class tractors and other machinery;

(E) To achieve economic unity between the city and the countryside, industry and agriculture, commodity production (through the exchange of buying and selling) should be maintained for a certain period of time, this being the only form of economic connection with the city that farmers can accept, and every effort should be made to expand Soviet trade, that is, state trade and cooperative-collective farm trade, and drive all capitalists out of commodity circulation.

The history of socialist construction in our country proves that the path of development designed by Lenin is completely correct.

Undoubtedly, for all capitalist countries with a considerable number of middle and small producers, this path of development is the only possible and appropriate path to the victory of socialism.

Some people say that commodity production will inevitably lead to capitalism under any conditions. This is incorrect. It is not true that commodity production and capitalist production are the same. These are two different things. Capitalist production is the highest form of commodity production. Only when there is private ownership of the means of production, only when labor power appears as a commodity on the market, the capitalist can buy it and exploit it in the production process, and only when the system of capitalist exploitation of hired labor exists in the country, commodity production will lead to capitalism. Capitalist production begins in such a situation, that is, when the means of production are concentrated in private hands, and the workers, deprived of the means of production, have to sell their labor power as a commodity. Without this situation, there is no capitalist production.

But if the conditions that turn commodity production into capitalist production are not met, if the means of production are no longer private property but socialist property, if the system of hired labor no longer exists, and labor power is no longer a commodity, if the system of exploitation has long been abolished, then what? Can it be said that commodity production will still lead to capitalism? No, it cannot be said so. After all, our society is a society where the system of private ownership of the means of production, the system of hired labor, and the system of exploitation no longer exist.

It is impossible to regard commodity production as something independent and self-existent, regardless of the surrounding economic conditions. Commodity production is older than capitalist production. It existed under the system of slavery and served the system of slavery, but it did not lead to capitalism. It existed under the feudal system and served the feudal system, but although it prepared some conditions for capitalist production, it did not lead to capitalism. If we note that in our country, commodity production has not expanded without limit and all-inclusively, as under capitalist conditions, commodity production, due to the decisive economic conditions of the establishment of public ownership of the means of production, the abolition of the system of hired labor, and the abolition of the system of exploitation, is strictly limited, then why can commodity production not serve our socialist society for a certain period of time without leading to capitalism?

Some people say that after the establishment of public ownership of the means of production and the abolition of the system of hired labor and exploitation in our country, the existence of commodity production has lost its meaning, and therefore commodity production should be eliminated.

This is also incorrect. At present, in our country, there are two basic forms of socialist production: one is the state's public form, and the other is the form that cannot be called public, the collective farm form. In state enterprises, the means of production and products are public property. In the enterprises of collective farms, although the means of production (land, machinery) also belong to the state, the products are the property of individual collective farms; because the labor in collective farms, like seeds, is their own, and the land given to collective farms for permanent use by the state, collective farms actually control it as their own property, although they cannot sell, buy, rent, or mortgage this land.

This situation makes it possible for the state to control only the products of state enterprises, while the products of collective farms can only be controlled by collective farms as their own property. However, collective farms are willing to transfer their products only in the form of commodities, willing to exchange these commodities for the commodities they need. At present, except through the connection of commodities, except through the exchange of buying and selling, there is no other economic connection with the city that collective farms accept. Therefore, commodity production and commodity circulation are currently necessary things in our country, just as they were about thirty years ago when Lenin announced that commodity circulation must be expanded with all our might.

Of course, after the emergence of a single, all-encompassing production department with the right to control all consumer goods in the country, replacing the two basic production departments, the state-operated department and the collective farm department, commodity circulation and its "monetary economy" will disappear as unnecessary factors in the national economy. However, as long as this condition is not met, as long as there are still two basic production departments, commodity production and commodity circulation should remain as necessary and extremely useful factors in the national economic system of our country. How to establish this single, unified department? Is it to let the state-operated department simply absorb the collective farm department, which is very difficult to imagine (because this will be understood as the expropriation of collective farms), or to organize a unified public (with representatives of state industry and collective farms) economic organization, which initially has the right to account for all consumer goods in the country, and after a period of time also has the right, for example, to distribute products by exchange of products? This is a special question that needs to be discussed separately.

It can be seen that commodity production in our country is not ordinary commodity production, but special commodity production, commodity production without the participation of capitalists, which is basically related to the commodities of united socialist producers (state, collective farms, cooperatives). Its scope of activity is limited to personal consumer goods. Obviously, it cannot develop into capitalist production, and it is destined to serve the cause of developing and consolidating socialist production together with its "monetary economy."

Therefore, the opinions of some comrades are completely incorrect, who claim that since the socialist society does not abolish the form of commodity production, then in our country it seems that all the economic categories peculiar to capitalism should be restored: labor power as a commodity, surplus value, capital, capital profit, average rate of profit, etc. These comrades confuse commodity production with capitalist production, believing that since there is commodity production, there should be capitalist production. They do not understand that commodity production in our country is fundamentally different from commodity production under the capitalist system.

And I think that several other concepts taken from Marx's "Capital," which is a special analysis of capitalism, and forcibly applied to our socialist relations, should also be abandoned. Among them, I refer to such concepts as "necessary" labor and "surplus" labor, "necessary" products and "surplus" products, "necessary" time and "surplus" time. Marx analyzed capitalism to explain the source of the exploitation of the working class, that is, surplus value, and to provide the working class, deprived of the means of production, with the spiritual weapon to overthrow capitalism. Obviously, the concepts (categories) used by Marx here are completely in line with capitalist relations. However, now that the working class not only has not been deprived of power and the means of production, but also holds power and owns the means of production, it is very strange to still use these concepts. Now, under our system, it is very absurd to say that labor power is a commodity, that workers are "employed," as if the working class that owns the means of production employs itself and sells its labor power to itself. Now it is also very strange to talk about "necessary" labor and "surplus" labor: as if under our conditions, the labor of workers given to society to expand production, develop education and health care, and organize defense, etc., is not as necessary for the working class that now holds power as the labor used to meet the personal needs of workers and their families.

It should be noted that in his "Critique of the Gotha Program," Marx, who is no longer studying capitalism but also incidentally studying the first stage of communist society, admits that labor given to society to expand production, manage education and health care, pay management expenses, establish reserves, etc., is as necessary as labor used to meet the consumption needs of the working class.

I think that our economists should eliminate this phenomenon of incompatibility between old concepts and the new situation of our socialist state, and replace old concepts with new concepts that are compatible with the new situation.

We can tolerate this incompatibility for a certain period of time, but now it is time for us to finally eliminate this incompatibility.

III. On the Issue of the Law of Value Under the Socialist System

Sometimes people ask, in our country, under our socialist system, does the law of value exist and does it operate?

Yes, it exists and operates. Where there are commodities and commodity production, there cannot be no law of value.

In our country, the scope of the operation of the law of value first includes commodity circulation, includes the exchange of commodities through buying and selling, includes mainly the exchange of commodities for personal consumption. Here, in this field, the law of value certainly maintains a regulating role within a certain range.

However, the operation of the law of value is not limited to the scope of commodity circulation, but also extends to the production side. Indeed, the law of value does not have a regulating role in our socialist production, but it still influences production, which must be considered in the leadership of production. The point is that the consumer goods necessary to compensate for the labor power expended in the production process are produced and sold in our country as commodities subject to the law of value. It is precisely here that the influence of the law of value on production can be seen. Therefore, in our enterprises, such problems as economic accounting and profit, cost, price, etc., have practical significance. Therefore, our enterprises cannot but should not ignore the law of value.

Is this good or bad? This is not bad. Under our current conditions, this is indeed not bad, because this situation educates our economic workers to produce rationally and makes them observe discipline. It is not bad because this situation teaches our economic workers to calculate production, to calculate production accurately, and to estimate the real things in production with the same accuracy, instead of talking about imaginary "approximate numbers." It is not bad because this situation teaches our economic workers to seek, discover, and utilize the potential reserves within production, instead of wasting them. It is not bad because this situation teaches our economic workers to constantly improve production methods, reduce production costs, achieve economic accounting, and make the enterprise profitable. This is a good practical school that accelerates the growth of our economic workers and turns them into true leaders of socialist production at the present stage of development.

The bad thing is not that the law of value influences the production in our country. The bad thing is that our economic workers and planning workers, with the exception of a few, know very little about the operation of the law of value, do not study this operation, and are not good at considering this operation in their accounting. This indeed explains why there are still some chaotic phenomena in the field of price policy in our country. Here is one of many examples: not long ago, in order to benefit the cotton industry, it was decided to adjust the price ratio of cotton and grain, to determine the price of grain sold to cotton growers, and to increase the price of cotton delivered to the state. Then, our economic workers and planning workers proposed a suggestion that could not help but surprise the Central Committee members. Because according to this suggestion, the price of one ton of grain was almost the same as the price of one ton of cotton, while the price of one ton of grain was equal to the price of one ton of bread. The Central Committee members pointed out: due to the additional costs of milling and baking, the price of one ton of bread should be higher than the price of one ton of grain; cotton is generally more valuable than grain, and the world market prices of cotton and grain also prove this. But the proposers could not give any clear reason for the Central Committee members' views. Therefore, the Central Committee had to handle this matter personally, lowering the price of grain and raising the price of cotton. If the suggestions of these comrades had been legally effective, what would have been the result? We would have bankrupted the cotton growers and had no cotton.

However, does all this mean that the law of value has as broad a scope of operation in our country as it does under the capitalist system, and that the law of value is the regulator of production in our country? No, that is not the meaning. In fact, under our economic system, the operation of the law of value is strictly limited within a certain range. As mentioned earlier, under our economic system, the activity of commodity production is limited within a certain range. The same must be said about the scope of the operation of the law of value. Undoubtedly, in cities and rural areas, without the private ownership of the means of production, and with the socialization of the means of production, the scope of the operation of the law of value and its influence on production will be strictly limited.

In the same direction, the law of planned (proportional) development of the national economy operates, which replaces the law of competition and anarchic production.

In the same direction, our annual plans and five-year plans, as well as our general economic policy, operate, which are based on the requirements of the law of planned development of the national economy.

All this makes the scope of the operation of the law of value in our country strictly limited. Under our system, the law of value will not play the role of a regulator of production.

This indeed explains this "surprising" fact: although socialist production in our country is developing continuously and vigorously, the law of value in our country has not led to crises of overproduction, but the same law of value, which has a broad scope of operation under the capitalist system, although the speed of production development in capitalist countries is very low, leads to periodic crises of overproduction.

Some people say that the law of value is an eternal law that is applicable to all historical development periods. If the law of value will lose its effectiveness as a regulator of exchange relations in the second stage of communist society, then in this stage of development it will still maintain its effectiveness as a regulator of the relations between different production departments, as a regulator of the distribution of labor between different production departments.

This is completely incorrect. Just as the law of value, value is a historical category associated with the existence of commodity production. Once commodity production disappears, value along with its various forms and the law of value will also disappear.

In the second stage of communist society, the amount of labor used to produce products will not be calculated in a roundabout way, not through value and its various forms, as in the system of commodity production, but directly by the number of hours spent on the production of products. As for the distribution of labor, the distribution of labor between different production departments will not be regulated by the law of value, which has then lost its effectiveness, but by the growth of the demand for products by society. This will be such a society where production will be regulated by the needs of society, and calculating the needs of society will have paramount importance for the planning agencies.

The following statement is also completely incorrect, that is, in our current economic system, that is, in the first stage of the development of communism, the law of value seems to regulate the "proportions" of the distribution of labor between different production departments.

If this were correct, it would be difficult to understand why in our country, we have not put all our efforts into developing light industry, which is more profitable than heavy industry, which often does not make a profit and sometimes cannot make a profit at all?

If this were correct, it would be difficult to understand why in our country, we do not close many heavy industry enterprises that cannot make a profit for the time being and where the labor of workers cannot produce the "expected effect," and do not open new light industry enterprises that can definitely make a profit and where the labor of workers can produce a "great effect"?

If this were correct, it would be difficult to understand why in our country, we do not, according to the law of value that supposedly regulates the "proportions" of the distribution of labor between different production departments, transfer workers from enterprises that are very necessary for the national economy but make little profit to more profitable enterprises?

It is obvious that if we follow the footsteps of these comrades, we will have to give up the leading position of the production of means of production. But what does giving up the leading position of the production of means of production mean? This means eliminating the possibility of continuous growth of our national economy, because if the leading position of the production of means of production is not simultaneously realized, it is impossible to achieve the continuous growth of the national economy.

These comrades have forgotten that the law of value is only the regulator of production under the capitalist system, under the existence of private ownership of the means of production, under the existence of competition and anarchic production, the existence of crises of overproduction. They have forgotten that in our country, the scope of the operation of the law of value is limited by the existence of public ownership of the means of production, by the operation of the law of planned development of the national economy, and thus by our annual plans and five-year plans, which roughly reflect the requirements of this law.

Some comrades have concluded from this that the law of planned development of the national economy and the planned nature of the national economy are eliminating the principle of profit in production. This is completely wrong. The situation is exactly the opposite. If we do not examine profit from the standpoint of individual enterprises or individual branches of production, nor from the standpoint of one year, but from the standpoint of the entire national economy and from the standpoint of, say, ten to fifteen years (this is the only correct way to handle the issue), then the temporary and unstable profits of individual enterprises or individual branches of production cannot be compared with the stable and enduring high form of profits that the law of planned development of the national economy and the planned nature of the national economy provide us with. They enable us to avoid the cyclical economic crises that disrupt the national economy and cause great material damage to society, and ensure that our national economy grows rapidly and continuously.

In brief: there is no doubt that under the present socialist conditions of production in our country, the law of value cannot be the "regulator of proportions" in the distribution of labor among the various different branches of production.

IV. On the Problem of Eliminating the Antagonism Between Town and Country, Between Mental and Physical Labor, and on the Problem of Eliminating the Differences Between Them

This title covers many fundamentally different issues, but I have combined them into one chapter not to confuse them, but solely for the sake of brevity in exposition.

The problem of eliminating the antagonism between town and country, between industry and agriculture, is a well-known problem that Marx and Engels raised long ago. The economic basis of this antagonism is that under the capitalist system, the entire process of development of industry, commerce, and credit makes the countryside suffer from the city, makes the peasant suffer from expropriation, and makes the majority of the rural population suffer from ruin. Therefore, under the capitalist system, the antagonism between town and country should be regarded as an antagonism of interests. On this basis, there arose the hostility of the countryside towards the city, towards the "city folk" in general.

Undoubtedly, in our country, with the elimination of capitalism and the exploitation system, and with the consolidation of the socialist system, the antagonism of interests between town and country, between industry and agriculture, must also disappear. And this is exactly what has happened. The socialist cities, our working class, in the cause of eliminating landlords and kulaks, have given our peasants tremendous help, consolidating the basis of the alliance between the working class and the peasantry, and systematically supplying the peasants and their collective farms with first-class tractors and other machinery, making the alliance between the working class and the peasants into a friendship between them. Of course, workers and collective farm peasants remain two classes that are different in status. But this difference in no way weakens their friendly relations. On the contrary, their interests are on a common line, on the common line of consolidating the socialist system and striving for the victory of communism. Therefore, it is not surprising that the distrust of the countryside towards the city, and especially the hatred towards the city, has disappeared without a trace.

All this indicates that the basis of the antagonism between town and country, between industry and agriculture, has been eliminated by the present socialist system in our country.

Of course, this does not mean that the elimination of the antagonism between town and country should lead to the "death of large cities" (see Engels' "Anti-Dühring"). Not only will large cities not die out, but new large cities will also appear, which are the centers of the most developed culture, which are not only the centers of large-scale industry but also the centers of the powerful development of the processing of agricultural products and all branches of the food industry. This will promote the cultural prosperity of the whole country and bring the living conditions of the countryside up to the level of the cities.

As for the problem of eliminating the antagonism between mental and physical labor, we have a similar situation. This problem is also a well-known problem that Marx and Engels raised long ago. The economic basis of the antagonism between mental and physical labor is the exploitation of physical laborers by mental laborers. Everyone knows that under the capitalist system, there is a split between the physical laborers and the management in enterprises. Everyone knows that the hostile attitude of workers towards factory managers, foremen, engineers, and other technical personnel is developed on the basis of this split. Obviously, with the elimination of capitalism and the exploitation system, the antagonism of interests between physical and mental labor must also disappear. In our present socialist system, it has indeed disappeared. Now physical laborers and management are not enemies but comrades and friends, all members of a unified production collective, all extremely concerned about the progress and improvement of production, and the past enmity between them has not left a trace.

As for the problem of eliminating the essential differences between town (industry) and countryside (agriculture), between physical and mental labor, this is a problem of an entirely different nature. This problem has not been raised by the classic writers of Marxism. This is a new problem raised by the practice of socialist construction in our country.

Is this problem fabricated? Does it have any practical or theoretical significance for us? This problem cannot be regarded as fabricated. On the contrary, it is extremely important for us.

For example, if we take the difference between agriculture and industry, then in our country, this difference is due not only to the fact that the conditions of labor in agriculture are different from those in industry, but primarily and mainly to the fact that in industry we have state ownership of the means of production and products, while in agriculture we do not have state ownership, but only collective, collective farm ownership. It has been said before that this situation leads to the preservation of commodity circulation, and only when the difference between industry and agriculture disappears, commodity production and all its consequences will also disappear. Therefore, it cannot be denied that the disappearance of this essential difference between agriculture and industry is of paramount importance to us.

The same must be said about the problem of eliminating the essential difference between mental and physical labor. This problem is also of paramount importance to us. Before the mass socialist emulation began to unfold, the development of industry in our country was not proceeding smoothly, and many comrades even raised the question of reducing the pace of industrial development. This was mainly due to the fact that at that time the cultural and technical level of the workers was too low, far behind the level of the technical personnel. However, when socialist emulation in our country has become mass-based, the situation has fundamentally changed. It is precisely after this that industry has begun to advance at an accelerated pace. Why has socialist emulation become mass-based? Because among the workers, there are batches of comrades who not only mastered the basic technical knowledge but also went further, standing on the same level as the technical personnel, beginning to correct the shortcomings of technicians and engineers, breaking the outdated existing norms, adopting new, more modern norms, etc. What if not a few workers, but the majority of workers, raised their cultural and technical level to the level of technical personnel? Then our industry would reach a height that the industry of other countries could not reach. Therefore, it cannot be denied that the elimination of the essential difference between physical and mental labor by raising the cultural and technical level of workers to the level of technical personnel is of paramount importance to us.

Some comrades assert that after a certain period, not only the essential differences between industry and agriculture, between physical and mental labor, will disappear, but any differences between them will also disappear. This is wrong. The disappearance of the essential differences between industry and agriculture cannot lead to the disappearance of any differences between them. Due to the differences in working conditions in industry and agriculture, some differences between them, although non-essential, will undoubtedly exist. Even within industry, if we are talking about various different branches, the working conditions are not the same everywhere: for example, the working conditions of coal miners are different from those of workers in mechanized shoe factories, the working conditions of miners are different from those of workers in the machine-building industry. If this is correct, then some differences between industry and agriculture will certainly be preserved.

The same must be said about the differences between mental and physical labor. The essential difference between them in terms of the disparity in cultural and technical levels will undoubtedly disappear. But some non-essential differences will still be preserved, at least because the working conditions of enterprise managers are different from those of workers.

Comrades who hold the opposite view probably rely on a well-known saying in some of my speeches, where it is said about the elimination of differences between industry and agriculture, between physical and mental labor, without adding that this refers to the elimination of essential differences, not all differences. Comrades have understood my saying in this way, that is, they have taken it to mean the elimination of all differences. But this shows that this saying is not precise, not satisfactory. It must be discarded and replaced by another saying, namely, the elimination of essential differences between industry and agriculture, between physical and mental labor, and the preservation of non-essential differences.

V. On the Problem of the Disintegration of the Unified World Market and the Deepening of the Crisis of the World Capitalist System

The most important result of the Second World War and its economic consequences must be considered the disintegration of the unified, all-encompassing world market. This situation determined the further deepening of the general crisis of the world capitalist system.

The Second World War itself was the product of this crisis. During the war, the two capitalist alliances that fought each other, each hoping to crush the enemy and gain world hegemony, sought to find a way out of the crisis from here. The United States hoped to defeat its most dangerous competitors, Germany and Japan, seize foreign markets, the world's raw material resources, and gain world hegemony.

However, the war dashed these hopes. Indeed, the competitors of the three major capitalist countries, the United States, Britain, and France, Germany and Japan, were defeated. But at the same time, China and other European people's democracies broke away from the capitalist system and, together with the Soviet Union, formed a unified and powerful socialist camp, standing in opposition to the capitalist camp. The economic result of the existence of the two opposing camps is that the unified, all-encompassing world market disintegrated, and now there are two parallel and opposing world markets.

It should be noted that the United States, Britain, and France themselves facilitated the formation and consolidation of this new parallel world market, of course, not out of their own volition. They imposed an economic blockade on the Soviet Union, China, and the European people's democracies that did not join the "Marshall Plan" system, intending to strangle them. In fact, they did not strangle them, but consolidated this new market.

Of course, the main thing in this regard is not the economic blockade, but the fact that in the post-war period, these countries united economically and established economic cooperation and mutual aid. This cooperation experience shows that no capitalist country can provide genuine help and technically sophisticated help like the Soviet Union. The problem is not only that this help is extremely cheap and first-class in technology. The problem is primarily that the basis of this cooperation is the sincere desire for mutual aid and the common economic upswing. As a result, in these countries, there has been a high-speed development of industry. It can be said with confidence that under such a high rate of industrial development, these countries will soon not only not need to import goods from capitalist countries but will themselves feel the need to export their surplus products to other countries.

However, from this it can be concluded that the scope of the seizure of world resources by the major capitalist countries (the United States, Britain, France) will not expand but will shrink; the conditions of the world market for the sale of goods for these countries will worsen, and the phenomenon of underutilization of enterprises in these countries will increase. This is the reason why the disintegration of the world market leads to the deepening of the general crisis of the world capitalist system.

This is something that the capitalists themselves feel, because losing markets like the Soviet Union and China is very difficult not to feel. They desperately try to patch up these difficulties with the "Marshall Plan," the Korean War, the arms race, and the militarization of industry. But this is like a drowning man clutching at a straw.

Due to this situation, two questions arise before the economists:

(A) Can it be asserted that Stalin's well-known thesis, put forward before the Second World War, about the relative stability of the market in the period of the general crisis of capitalism, is still valid?

(B) Can it be asserted that Lenin's well-known thesis, published in the spring of 1916, that although capitalism is decaying, "overall, capitalism has developed more rapidly than ever before," is still valid?

I think not. Due to the new conditions created by the Second World War, both of these theses should be considered to have lost their validity.

VI. On the Problem of the Inevitability of War Between Capitalist Countries

Some comrades assert that due to the development of the new international conditions after the Second World War, war between capitalist countries is no longer inevitable. They believe: the antagonism between the socialist camp and the capitalist camp is more acute than the antagonism between capitalist countries; the United States has controlled other capitalist countries to such an extent that it can prevent them from fighting each other and weakening each other; the advanced elements of capitalism have learned the lessons of the two world wars that brought serious harm to the entire capitalist world to such an extent that they will not allow themselves to be drawn into a war between capitalist countries again—due to all this, war between capitalist countries is no longer inevitable.

These comrades are wrong. They see only the surface phenomena that flash before the eyes, but do not see the latent forces that, although not yet clearly manifested, will nevertheless determine the course of events.

From the surface, everything seems to be "peaceful"; the United States has made Western Europe, Japan, and other capitalist countries dependent on it; Germany (West Germany), Britain, France, Italy, Japan have fallen into the iron claws of the United States, obediently carrying out the will of the United States. But if one thinks that this "peace" will "last forever," that these countries will endure the rule and oppression of the United States indefinitely, that they will not try to break free from the shackles of the United States and take the path of independent development, then one is wrong.

Let us first look at Britain and France. Undoubtedly, these are both imperialist countries. Undoubtedly, cheap raw materials and guaranteed markets of sale are of paramount importance to them. Can one imagine that when the Americans, under the pretext of the "Marshall Plan" "aid," penetrate the economy of Britain and France, trying to turn it into an appendage of the American economy, when American capital seizes raw materials and markets of sale in British and French colonies, thus preparing to cause the high profits of British and French capitalists to collapse, Britain and France will endure the present situation indefinitely? If it is said that capitalist Britain, and then capitalist France, will ultimately have to break away from the embrace of the United States, clash with the United States, in order to ensure their independent position, and of course, also ensure high profits, is this not more correct?

Now let us look at the main defeated countries, Germany (West Germany) and Japan. These countries are now living a miserable life under the iron hoof of American imperialism. Their industry and agriculture, their commerce, their foreign and domestic policies, their entire life, are shackled by the American "system" of occupation. But these countries, which yesterday were powerful imperialist states that shook the foundations of British, American, and French rule in Europe and Asia, if one thinks that these countries will not try to rise again, break the American "system," and take the path of independent development, this is like believing in ghosts.

Some people say that the antagonism between capitalism and socialism is more acute than the antagonism between capitalist countries. This is correct in theory. This is correct not only now, at present, but also before the Second World War. This is something that the leaders of the capitalist countries also more or less understand. However, the Second World War did not start with an attack on the Soviet Union, but with a war between capitalist countries. Why? First, because for capitalism, an attack on the Soviet Union, that is, on a socialist country, is more dangerous than a war between capitalist countries, because the question that a war between capitalist countries raises is only the question of certain capitalist countries gaining an advantage over other capitalist countries, while the question that an attack on the Soviet Union necessarily raises is the question of the very existence of capitalism. Second, because the capitalists, for the sake of "propaganda," shout about the "aggression" of the Soviet Union, but they themselves do not believe in the aggression of the Soviet Union, because they estimate the peaceful policy of the Soviet Union and know that the Soviet Union itself will not attack capitalist countries.

After the First World War, people also thought that Germany had been completely defeated, just as some comrades now think that Japan and Germany have been completely defeated. At that time, people also talked and shouted in the newspapers that the United States had made Europe dependent on it, that Germany would never rise again, that there would be no more wars between capitalist countries. Although this was the case, Germany, after being defeated, after fifteen to twenty years, broke free from slavery and took the path of independent development, stood up again as a strong country, and stood firmly on its feet. It is noteworthy that it was not someone else but Britain and the United States who helped Germany stand up economically and raise its military economic potential. Of course, the United States and Britain helped Germany stand up economically with the intention of directing the already risen Germany against the Soviet Union, that is, using it against the socialist countries. However, Germany first used its own strength to fight against the Anglo-French-American bloc. And when Hitler's Germany declared war on the Soviet Union, the Anglo-French-American bloc did not unite with Hitler's Germany but had to form an alliance with the Soviet Union to fight against Hitler's Germany.

It is clear that at that time, the struggle between capitalist countries for markets and their desire to drown their competitors was, in practice, more acute than the antagonism between the capitalist camp and the socialist camp.

What guarantee is there that Germany and Japan will not rise again, will not try to break free from the shackles of the United States, and thus live their own independent lives? I think there is no such guarantee.

From this, it is clear that the inevitability of war between capitalist countries still exists.

Some people say that since a powerful people's force has now risen, which is defending peace and opposing a new world war, Lenin's thesis about the inevitability of imperialist war should be considered outdated. This statement is wrong.

The current peace movement aims to arouse the masses to struggle for the maintenance of peace and the prevention of a new world war. Therefore, its purpose is not to overthrow capitalism and establish socialism—it is limited to the democratic purpose of struggling for the maintenance of peace. This is the difference between the current peace movement and the movement during the First World War to turn the imperialist war into a civil war, because the latter movement went further, it had a socialist purpose.

It is possible that in a certain combination of circumstances, the struggle for peace will flare up into a struggle for socialism in some place, but this will no longer be the current peace movement, but a movement to overthrow capitalism.

The most likely outcome is that the current peace movement, that is, the movement to maintain peace, will, upon achieving victory, prevent a new war, delay a new war for a while, temporarily maintain the current peace, and make the warlike government resign and replace it with another government that is willing to maintain peace for a while. This is certainly good. Even very good. However, this is still not enough to fundamentally eliminate the inevitability of war between capitalist countries. It is not enough because, despite all the victories of the peace movement, imperialism still exists, still exists, and therefore the inevitability of war also still exists.

To eliminate the inevitability of war, it is necessary to eliminate imperialism.

VII. On the Problem of the Basic Economic Laws of Modern Capitalism and Socialism

Everyone knows that the problem of the basic economic laws of capitalism and socialism has been raised several times in discussions. Various opinions have been expressed on this issue, including the most absurd ones. Indeed, the majority of those who participated in the discussion reacted little to this issue and did not make any decisions on it. However, no one who participated in the discussion denied the existence of these laws.

Does the basic economic law of capitalism exist? Yes, it exists. What is this law? What are its characteristics? The basic economic law of capitalism is such a law that it does not determine this or that individual aspect or individual processes of the development of capitalist production, but determines all the main aspects and all the main processes of the development of capitalist production, and therefore determines the essence of capitalist production, determines the essence of capitalist production.

Is the law of value the basic economic law of capitalism? No, it is not. The law of value is first of all the law of commodity production. It existed before capitalism, just as it continues to exist after the overthrow of capitalism, for example, in our country, although its scope of action is limited. The law of value, under capitalist conditions, has a wide scope of action, it plays a great role in the development of capitalist production, but it does not determine the essence of capitalist production and the basis of capitalist profit, it does not even raise such a question. Therefore, the law of value cannot be the basic economic law of modern capitalism.

For the same reason, the law of competition and the anarchy of production, or the law of the uneven development of capitalism in different countries, cannot be the basic economic law of capitalism.

Some people say that the law of the average rate of profit is the basic economic law of modern capitalism. This is wrong. Modern capitalism, that is, monopoly capitalism, cannot be satisfied with the average rate of profit, and this average rate of profit, due to the increase in the organic composition of capital, has a tendency to decline. Modern monopoly capitalism does not require an average rate of profit, but rather a rate of profit that is sufficiently high to ensure the maximum profit necessary for the expansion of reproduction.

The law that best fits the concept of the basic economic law of capitalism is the law of surplus value, that is, the law of the production and increase of capitalist profit. This law truly predetermines the basic features of capitalist production. However, the law of surplus value is too general a law, it does not touch on the question of the highest rate of profit, and ensuring this rate of profit is the condition for the development of monopoly capitalism. To remedy this deficiency, it is necessary to concretize the law of surplus value, to develop it to suit the conditions of monopoly capitalism, and at the same time to consider that monopoly capitalism requires not just any profit, but precisely the maximum profit. This will be the basic economic law of modern capitalism.

The main characteristics and requirements of the basic economic law of modern capitalism can be roughly stated as follows: by exploiting the majority of its own population and making them bankrupt and impoverished, by enslaving and constantly plundering the peoples of other countries, especially the backward countries, and by waging wars and militarizing the national economy aimed at ensuring the highest profit, to ensure the maximum capitalist profit.

Some people say that it can be considered that the average rate of profit is still sufficient for the development of capitalism under the present conditions. This is wrong. The average rate of profit is the minimum limit of profit, and if it falls any lower, capitalist production will become impossible. However, if it is thought that the heads of modern monopoly capitalism, in seizing colonies, enslaving the peoples of various countries, and organizing new wars, that is, the best "business" for the heads of modern capitalism, which they strive to ensure for themselves, is only the average rate of profit, that would be laughable. No, it is not the average rate of profit, nor the usual slightly higher than the average rate of profit, but precisely the maximum profit that is the driving force of monopoly capitalism. It is precisely because it is necessary to obtain the maximum profit that monopoly capitalism is driven to take such risky steps as enslaving and constantly plundering colonies and other backward countries, turning many independent countries into dependent countries, organizing new wars, that is, the best "business" for the heads of modern capitalism, which they consider to be the best way to obtain the maximum profit, and attempting to seize the economic hegemony of the world.

The significance of the basic economic law of capitalism is precisely that this law, since it determines all the most important phenomena in the development of the capitalist mode of production, since it determines the upswing and crisis of capitalist production, its victories and defeats, its strengths and weaknesses, the entire process of the development of its contradictions, enables us to understand and explain all these phenomena.

Look at one of the many "amazing" examples.

Everyone knows that in the history and practice of capitalism, there have been facts that show the vigorous development of technology under the capitalist system, when capitalists appeared as the standard-bearers of advanced technology, as revolutionaries in the field of production technology. But everyone also knows that there have been other facts that show the cessation of technological development under the capitalist system, when capitalists appeared as reactionaries in the field of new technology, and often resorted to manual labor.

How to explain this amazing contradiction? Only by the necessity of obtaining the maximum profit, that is, by the basic economic law of modern capitalism, can this be explained. When new technology promises the highest profit to capitalism, capitalism supports new technology. When new technology no longer promises the highest profit to capitalism, capitalism opposes new technology, advocating a return to manual labor.

As for the basic economic law of socialism, does it exist? Yes, it exists. What are its main characteristics and requirements? The main characteristics and requirements of the basic economic law of socialism can be roughly stated as follows: by means of highly developed technology, to ensure the constant growth and constant improvement of socialist production, to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole society.

Therefore, it is not the maximum profit but the maximum satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of society; it is not the development of production with intervals of upswing and crisis, but the constant growth of production; it is not the periodic intervals in the development of technology that come with the destruction of social productive forces, but the constant improvement of production on a highly developed technological basis.

Some people say that the basic economic law of socialism is the law of the planned and proportional development of the national economy. This is wrong. The planned development of the national economy, that is, the national economy planning that more or less truly reflects this law, if it does not know for what task the planned development of the national economy is being carried out, or if the task is unclear, it itself cannot provide anything. The law of the planned development of the national economy can only produce the desired effect if it knows the task that the planned development of the national economy is to accomplish. The law of the planned development of the national economy itself cannot provide this task. The planning of the national economy can even less provide this task. This task is contained in the basic economic law of socialism, that is, it is expressed in the aforementioned requirements of this law. Therefore, the action of the law of the planned development of the national economy can only be fully manifested when it is based on the basic economic law of socialism.

As for the planning of the national economy, it can only achieve good results if it meets the following two conditions: (a) it correctly reflects the requirements of the law of the planned development of the national economy, (b) it meets the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism in all respects.

VIII. Other Problems

(1) On the Problem of Extra-Economic Compulsion Under the Feudal System

Of course, extra-economic compulsion played a role in consolidating the economic power of the feudal landlords, but the basis of the feudal system is not extra-economic compulsion, but feudal land ownership.

(2) On the Problem of the Personal Property of Collective Farm Households

If the draft of the textbook says "each household in the collective farm has cows, small livestock, and poultry for personal use," then this is incorrect. Everyone knows that in fact, cows, small livestock, poultry, etc., are not for the personal use of households in the collective farm, but are the personal property of the households. The phrase "for personal use" is probably taken from the model charter of the agricultural labor associations. But in the model charter of the agricultural labor associations, there is an error. In the more carefully drafted Soviet Constitution, it is expressed differently, namely:

"Each household in the collective farm ... owns all the subsidiary economy on this plot of land, as well as the dwelling, food animals, poultry, and small tools as its personal property."

This is certainly correct.

In addition, it should be said in more detail that each member of the collective farm, according to local conditions, has one to several cows, several sheep, goats, pigs (also according to local conditions from several to several) and an unlimited number of poultry (ducks, geese, chickens, turkeys) as his personal property.

This detailed description is of great significance to our foreign comrades who want to know exactly what remains as the personal property of each household in the collective farm after the realization of agricultural collectivization in our country.

(3) On the Problem of the Amount of Rent Paid by Peasants to Landlords and the Amount of the Cost of Purchasing Land

In the draft of the textbook, it is said that as a result of the nationalization of land, "peasants were freed from paying rent to landlords, the total amount of which was about five hundred million rubles a year" (it should be said "gold rubles"). It is necessary to make this figure accurate, because in my opinion, this figure does not calculate the rent of the whole of Russia, but only the rent of the majority of the provinces of Russia. Here it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that in some border areas of Russia, rent was paid in kind, it seems that the authors of the draft of the textbook did not consider this. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that the peasants were not only freed from rent, but also from the annual cost of purchasing land. Is this considered in the draft of the textbook? In my opinion, it is not considered, but it should be considered.

(4) On the Problem of the Combination of Monopoly Organizations and State Organs

The term "combination" is inappropriate. This term, in appearance and expression, indicates the proximity of monopoly organizations and state organs, but does not reveal the economic significance of this proximity. The issue is that in the process of this proximity, not only a combination occurs, but also the subordination of state organs to monopoly organizations. Therefore, the term "combination" should be removed and replaced with the expression "subordination of state organs to monopoly organizations."

(5) On the Problem of the Use of Machines in the Soviet Union

In the draft of the textbook, it is said: "In the Soviet Union, machines are used wherever they can save labor for society." This is completely incorrect. First, machines in the Soviet Union always save labor for society, so we do not know of any situation in the Soviet Union where machines do not save labor for society. Second, machines not only save labor but also lighten the work of workers, so, unlike capitalist conditions, workers in our conditions are extremely willing to use machines in the labor process.

Therefore, it should be said that there is no place like the Soviet Union where machines are so willingly used, because machines save labor for society and lighten the work of workers; because there is no unemployment in the Soviet Union, workers are extremely willing to use machines in the national economy.

(6) On the Problem of the Material Conditions of the Working Class in Capitalist Countries

When people talk about the material conditions of the working class, they usually refer to the workers in production, without considering the material conditions of the so-called reserve army of the unemployed. Is this correct way to view the problem of the material conditions of the working class? I think it is not correct. Since there is a reserve army of the unemployed, and its members cannot survive except by selling their labor power, then the unemployed cannot but be included in the working class, but since they are included in the working class, then their poverty cannot but affect the material conditions of the workers in production. Therefore, I think that in explaining the material conditions of the working class in capitalist countries, it is also necessary to consider the conditions of the reserve army of the unemployed.

(7) On the Problem of National Income

I think it is necessary to add a new chapter on national income in the draft of the textbook.

(8) On the Problem of a Special Chapter in the Textbook on the Creators of Socialist Political Economy, Lenin and Stalin

I think the chapter "Marxism on the Doctrine of Socialism. Lenin and Stalin's Creation of Socialist Political Economy" should be removed from the textbook. It is completely unnecessary in the textbook, because it does not provide anything new, but only tediously repeats things that have been explained in more detail in the previous chapters.

I have no objections to the "suggestions" of Comrades Ostrovityanov, Leontiev, Shevlyakov, Gatovskii, and others on the remaining issues.

IX. The International Significance of the Marxist Political Economy Textbook

I think comrades have not fully appreciated the significance of the Marxist political economy textbook. This textbook is not only needed by our Soviet youth. It is especially needed by communists in various countries and by all those who sympathize with communists. Our foreign comrades want to know how we broke free from the shackles of capitalism, how we transformed the national economy with a socialist spirit, how we established friendly relations with the peasants, how we turned our country, which was recently poor and weak, into a rich and powerful country, what collective farms are, and why we, although the means of production have already been nationalized, have not yet abolished commodity production, money, trade, etc. They want to know all this and many other things, not just out of curiosity, but to learn from us and to use our experience for their own countries. Therefore, the publication of a good Marxist political economy textbook not only has domestic political significance but also has great international significance.

Therefore, we need a textbook that will be a must-read not only for revolutionary youth in our country but also for revolutionary youth abroad. Its volume should not be too large, because a large textbook cannot be a must-read and is difficult to understand and master. But it should contain all the basic things about our economy and the economy of the capitalist and colonial systems.

Some comrades proposed during the discussion to add many new chapters to the textbook, historians proposed such suggestions on the historical side, politicians on the political side, philosophers on the philosophical side, economists on the economic side. However, this will make the volume of the textbook unlimitedly large. This is of course not permissible. This textbook is to explain political economy problems using the historical method, but this does not mean that we should turn the political economy textbook into a history of economic relations.

We need a textbook of five hundred pages, at most not exceeding six hundred pages. This will be a must-read book on Marxist political economy, a good gift to the young communists of the world.

However, due to the fact that the theoretical level of Marxism in most foreign communist parties is not high, such a textbook will also be of great benefit to the non-youth communist cadres in these countries.

X. Ways to Improve the Draft of the Political Economy Textbook

Some comrades were too zealous in "criticizing" the draft of the textbook, scolding the authors for their mistakes and negligence, asserting that the draft had failed. This is unfair. Of course, there are mistakes and negligence in the textbook, mistakes and negligence in big things are almost always present. However, in the end, the majority of those who participated in the discussion still admitted that the draft of the textbook can be used as the basis for the future textbook, if some corrections and additions are made. Indeed, if we compare this draft of the textbook with the current textbooks in circulation, we can conclude that this draft of the textbook is much better than all the existing textbooks. The great merit of the authors of the draft of the textbook lies in this.

I think that to improve the draft of the textbook, a small commission should be appointed, which should include not only the authors of the textbook, not only those who agree with the opinion of the majority at the discussion, but also those who disagree with the opinion of the majority at the discussion and strongly criticize the draft of the textbook.

It would be best if the commission also included an experienced statistician to check the figures and add new statistical materials to the draft, and also an experienced jurist to check the accuracy of the wording.

The commission members should be temporarily relieved of any other work, and they should be provided with sufficient material guarantees so that they can devote themselves to the compilation of the textbook.

In addition, a commission of, say, three people should be appointed to finally proofread the textbook, which is also necessary to achieve uniformity of style, which was not achieved in the draft of the textbook.

    苏联社会主义经济问题
    ——给经济问题讨论会的参加者
    对于与一九五一年十一月讨论会有关的经济问题的意见
    斯大林
    我已收到因评定政治经济学教科书未定稿而举行的经济问题讨论会的一切文件，其中包括：“对改善政治经济学教科书未定稿的建议”，“对消除未定稿中的错误和不确切处的建议”，“关于争论问题的说明材料”。
    对于这一切材料，以及对于教科书未定稿，我认为必须提出如下的意见。
    一、关于社会主义制度下经济法则的性质问题
    某些同志否认科学法则的客观性质，特别是否认社会主义制度下政治经济学法则的客观性质。他们否认政治经济学法则是反映不以人们的意志为转移的过程的规律性。他们认为，由于历史所赋予苏维埃国家的特殊作用，苏维埃国家及其领导者能废除现存的政治经济学法则，能“制定”新的法则，“创造”新的法则。
    这些同志是大错特错了。显然，他们把下列两种东西混为一谈了：一种是科学法则，它反映自然中或社会中不以人们的意志为转移的客观过程；另一种是政府所颁布的法令，它是依据人们的意志创造出来，并且只有法律上的效力。但这两种东西无论如何是不能混为一谈的。
    马克思主义把科学法则——无论是指自然科学法则或政治经济学法则都一样——了解为不以人们的意志为转移的客观过程的反映。人们能发现这些法则，认识它们，研究它们，在自己的行动中估计到它们，利用它们来为社会谋福利，但是人们不能改变或废除这些法则，尤其不能制定或创造新的科学法则。
    这是不是说，例如，自然法则发生作用的结果、即自然力发生作用的结果是根本无法防止的，自然力的破坏作用在任何地方和任何时候都是以自发的、无可抑制的、不受人们影响的力量而出现的呢？不，不是这个意思。当然，在天文、地质及其他某些类似的过程中，人们即使已经认识了它们的发展法则，也确实无力去影响它们。如果把这些过程除外，那末在其他许多场合下，就可能影响自然过程这点来说，人们决不是无能为力的。在一切这样的场合下，人们如果认识了自然法则，估计到它们，依靠着它们，善于应用和利用它们，便能限制它们发生作用的范围，把自然的破坏力引导到另一方向，使自然的破坏力转而为社会造福。
    我们且从许许多多的例子中举出一个来看。在上古时代，江河泛滥、洪水、以及由此引起的房屋和庄稼的毁灭，曾经认为是无法防止的灾害，人们无力加以制止。然而，随着时间的推移，随着人类知识的发展，当人们学会了修筑堤坝和水电站的时候，就能使社会防止在从前看来是无法防止的水灾。不但如此，人们还学会了制止自然的破坏力，可以说是学会了驾御它们，使水力转而为社会造福，利用水来灌溉田地，取得动力。
    这是不是说，人们就因而废除了自然法则、科学法则，创造了新的自然法则、新的科学法则呢？不，不是这个意思。问题在于防止水力的破坏作用并利用它来为社会谋福利的这一整个程序，是丝毫没有违反、改变或消灭科学法则，丝毫没有创造新的科学法则的。恰恰相反，这一整个程序是确切地根据自然法则、科学法则而实现的，因为对自然法则的任何违反，即使是极小的违反，都只会引起事情的混乱，引起程序的破坏。
    对于经济发展法则，对于政治经济学法则，——无论是指资本主义时期或社会主义时期都一样，——也必须这样说。在这里，也如在自然科学中一样，经济发展的法则是反映不以人们的意志为转移的经济发展过程的客观法则。人们能发现这些法则，认识它们，依靠它们，利用它们来为社会谋福利，把某些法则所发生的破坏作用引导到另一方向，限制它们发生作用的范围，给予其他正在争取为自己开辟道路的法则以发生作用的广阔场所。但是人们不能消灭这些法则或创造新的经济法则。
    政治经济学的特点之一就在于：它的法则与自然科学的法则不同，不是长久不变的；政治经济学法则，至少是其中大多数，是在一定的历史时期中发生作用的，在此以后，它们就让位给新的法则。但是原来的这些法则，并不是被消灭，而是由于出现了新的经济条件而失去效力，退出舞台，让位给新的法则，这些新的法则并不是由人们的意志创造出来，而是在新的经济条件的基础上产生的。
    有人引证恩格斯的“反杜林论”，引证他如下的这个公式：随着资本主义的消灭和生产资料的公有化，人们将获得支配自己生产资料的权力，将获得解脱社会经济关系压迫的自由，而成为自己社会生活的“主人”。恩格斯把这种自由叫作“被认识了的必然性”。究竟“被认识了的必然性”是什么意思呢？这就是说，人们认识了客观的法则（“必然性”）之后，将十分自觉地运用这些法则来为社会谋福利。正因为如此，所以恩格斯在同一地方说：
    “人们自己的社会行动的法则，直到现在都如同异己的、统治着人们的自然法则一样而与人们相对立，这些法则将被具有完备知识的人们应用，因而将服从他们的统治。”
    可见，恩格斯的这个公式，决不是对于那些以为在社会主义制度下可以消灭现存经济法则和创造新经济法则的人们有利的。恰恰相反，这个公式不是要消灭经济法则，而是要认识它们和善于运用它们。
    有人说，经济法则具有自发性质，这些法则所发生的作用是不可防止的，社会在它们面前是无能为力的。这样说是不对的。这是把法则偶像化，是让自己去做法则的奴隶。已经证明：社会在法则面前并不是无能为力的，社会认识了经济法则以后，依靠它们，就能限制它们发生作用的范围，利用它们来为社会谋福利，并“驾御”它们，正如在自然力及其法则方面所发生的情形一样，正如上面所举的江河泛滥的例子表明的情形一样。
    有人援引苏维埃政权在建成社会主义方面的特殊作用，仿佛这种作用使苏维埃政权有可能去消灭现存的经济发展法则，并“制定”新的经济发展法则。这也是不对的。
    苏维埃政权的特殊作用，是由下列两种情况来说明的：第一，苏维埃政权不是以另一种剥削形式去代替一种剥削形式，如像以往革命中的情形那样，而是消灭了任何剥削；第二，由于国内缺乏任何现成的社会主义经济的萌芽，苏维埃政权当时必得在可以说是“空地上”创造新的社会主义的经济形式。
    这个任务无疑是困难而复杂的，是没有先例的。然而，苏维埃政权光荣地完成了这个任务。但是，它之所以完成了这个任务，并不是因为它似乎消灭了现存的经济法则，“制定”了新的经济法则，而仅仅是因为它依靠了生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这个经济法则。以前我国的生产力，特别在工业中的生产力，是具有社会性的，但所有制的形式却是私人的，资本主义的。苏维埃政权依据生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这个经济法则，把生产资料公有化了，使之成为全体人民的财产，因而消灭了剥削制度，创造了社会主义的经济形式。如果没有这个法则，不依靠这个法则，苏维埃政权是不能完成自己的任务的。
    生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一经济法则，早已在资本主义国家中争取为自己开辟道路。它之所以还没有给自己开辟出道路，还没有获得发生作用的广阔场所，这是因为它遇到了社会衰朽力量极强烈的反抗。在这里，我们碰到了经济法则的另一个特点。在自然科学中，发现和应用新的法则是或多或少顺利地进行的；与此相反，在经济学领域中，发现和应用那些触犯社会衰朽力量的利益的新法则，却要遇到这些力量极强烈的反抗。因此，必须有能够克服这种反抗的力量，社会力量，在我国，找到了这种力量，其形式就是占社会绝大多数的工人阶级和农民的联盟。这种力量在其他国家、即资本主义国家中还没有找到。苏维埃政权之所以能够粉碎了旧的社会力量，而生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这个经济法则之所以在我国获得了发生作用的充分广阔场所，其秘密就在于此。
    有人说，我国国民经济有计划的（按比例的）发展的必然性，使苏维埃政权有可能来消灭现存的经济法则和创造新的经济法则。这是完全不对的。不能把我们的各个年度计划和五年计划跟国民经济有计划发展、按比例发展的客观经济法则混为一谈。国民经济有计划发展的法则，是作为资本主义制度下竞争和生产无政府状态的法则的对立物而产生的。它是当竞争和生产无政府状态的法则失去效力以后，在生产资料公有化的基础上产生的。它之所以发生了作用，是因为只有在国民经济有计划发展的经济法则的基础上，社会主义的国民经济才能进行。这就是说，国民经济有计划发展的法则，使我们的计划机关有可能去正确地计划社会生产。但是，不能把可能同现实混为一谈。这是两种不同的东西。要把这种可能变为现实，就必须研究这个经济法则，必须掌握它，必须学会以完备的知识去应用它，必须制定出能完全反映这个法则的要求的计划。不能说，我们的各个年度计划和五年计划都完全反映出这个经济法则的要求。
    有人说，在我国社会主义制度下发生作用的若干经济法则，连价值法则也在内，是在计划经济的基础上“改造过的”，或者甚至是“根本改造过的”法则。这也是不对的。法则不能“改造”，尤其不能“根本改造”。如果能改造法则，那也就能消灭法则，而以另外的法则去代替它们了。“改造”法则的论点，就是“消灭”和“制定”法则的这种不正确公式的残余。虽然关于改造经济法则的公式，早已在我们这里流行起来，可是为了准确起见，必须把这个公式抛弃。可以限制这些或那些经济法则发生作用的范围，可以防止它们发生的破坏作用（当然，如果有的话），但是不能“改造”或“消灭”法则。
    因此，当人们讲到“征服”自然力量或经济力量，讲到“控制”它们等等的时候，他们决不是想说：人们能够“消灭”科学法则或“制定”科学法则。恰恰相反，他们只是想以此来说明，人们能够发现法则，认识它们，掌握它们，学会以完备的知识去运用它们，利用它们来为社会谋福利，从而征服它们，求得控制它们。
    这样，在社会主义制度下，政治经济学的法则是反映不以我们的意志为转移的经济生活过程的规律性的客观法则。否认这个原理的人，事实上就是否认科学，而否认科学，也就是否认任何预见的可能性，因而就是否认领导经济生活的可能性。
    也许有人会说，这里所说的都是正确的和众所周知的，可是其中并没有什么新东西，因而不值得花费时间来重述众所周知的真理。当然，在这里的确没有什么新东西，但是如果以为不值得花费时间来重述若干我们熟悉的真理，那就不对了。问题在于，每年有成千的年青的新干部来接近我们这个领导核心，他们抱着热烈的愿望要帮助我们，抱着热烈的愿望要显示自己，但是他们没有受到足够的马克思主义的教育，不知道我们所熟悉的许多真理，而不得不在黑暗中摸索。苏维埃政权的巨大成就使他们惊讶，苏维埃制度异乎寻常的成功冲昏了他们的头脑，他们就以为，苏维埃政权是“无所不能”的，是“什么都不费力”的，它能消灭科学法则，能制定新的法则。我们对于这些同志该怎样办呢？要如何以马克思列宁主义的精神去教育他们呢？我以为，有系统地重复所谓“众所周知”的真理，耐心地解释这些真理，便是以马克思主义教育这些同志的最好的方法之一。
    二、关于社会主义制度下的商品生产问题
    某些同志断定说，党在我国取得了政权并把生产资料收归国有以后，还保存商品生产，是作得不对的。他们认为，党在当时便应当消除商品生产。关于这点，他们引了恩格斯如下的话来作证明：
    “一旦社会占有了生产资料，那末商品生产以及产品对生产者的统治，将同时被消除。”
    （见“反杜林论”）
    这些同志是大错特错了。
    我们来分析一下恩格斯的这个公式吧。恩格斯的这个公式不能认为是十分明确的，因为其中没有指出，这里所说的是社会占有一切生产资料，还是只占有一部分生产资料，即一切生产资料转归全民所有，还是仅仅一部分生产资料转归全民所有。这就是说，恩格斯的这个公式可以了解成这样，也可以了解成那样。
    在“反杜林论”的另一个地方，恩格斯讲到占有“一切生产资料”，讲到占有“生产资料的全部总和”。这就是说，恩格斯在他自己的公式中所指的，不是把一部分生产资料收归国有，而是把一切生产资料收归国有，即不仅把工业中的生产资料，而且也把农业中的生产资料都转归全民所有。
    由此可见，恩格斯所指的是这样一些国家，在那里，不仅在工业中，而且也在农业中，资本主义和生产集中都充分发达，以致可以剥夺全国的一切生产资料，并把它们转归全民所有。因而，恩格斯认为，在这样的国家中除了把一切生产资料公有化以外，还应该消除商品生产。这当然是正确的。
    在十九世纪末，到“反杜林论”出版的时候，只有英国一个国家是这样的国家，在那里，工业和农业中的资本主义发展和生产集中已达到这样的高度，只要无产阶级取得了政权，就有可能把国内的一切生产资料转归全民所有，并且消除商品生产。
    在这里，我撇开了在英国国民经济中占有巨大比重的对外贸易对于英国的意义这个问题。我以为，只有研究了这个问题之后，才能最终解决在英国无产阶级取得政权并把一切生产资料收归国有以后商品生产的命运问题。
    甚至，不仅在十九世纪末，而且在现时也还没有一个国家在农业中的资本主义发展和生产集中是已经达到了像我们在英国所看到的那种程度。至于说到其余的国家，虽然那里的农村中有着资本主义的发展，可是农村中却还有人数相当众多的中小私有生产者阶级，这些人的命运是在无产阶级取得政权时应该予以确定的。
    但是这里有一个问题：如果在某个国家内，也曾在我们国家内，当无产阶级取得政权和推翻资本主义的有利条件已经具备，工业中的资本主义已把生产资料如此集中，以致可以剥夺它们，把它们转归社会所有，可是那里的农业，虽然有了资本主义的发展，却因有人数众多的中小私有生产者而仍然如此分散，以致没有可能提出剥夺这些生产者的问题，那末，无产阶级及其政党该怎么办呢？
    恩格斯的公式对于这个问题并没有给予回答。但是，这个公式也不应当回答这个问题，因为它是在另一个问题的基础上产生的，而这另一个问题就是，在一切生产资料公有化以后，商品生产的命运应当怎样？
    因此，如果可以公有化的不是一切生产资料，而仅仅是一部分生产资料，而无产阶级夺取政权的有利条件又已经具备，那将怎么办呢，——无产阶级是否应该夺取政权，在夺取政权以后是否必须立即消灭商品生产呢？
    当然，不能把某些可怜的马克思主义者的意见叫作回答，他们认为，在这样的条件下，应该拒绝夺取政权，只有等到资本主义使千百万中小生产者破产、把他们变为雇农、并把农业生产资料集中起来以后，才可以提出无产阶级夺取政权和一切生产资料公有化的问题。显然，马克思主义者是不能选择这样的“出路”的，如果他们不愿意使自己丢尽脸皮的话。
    也不能把另一种可怜的马克思主义者的意见当作回答，他们以为，也许应该夺取政权，并着手剥夺农村的中小生产者，把他们的生产资料公有化。马克思主义者也不能走这条荒谬和犯罪的道路，因为这样的道路就会摧毁无产阶级革命胜利的任何可能性，就会把农民长久地抛掷到无产阶级敌人的阵营中。
    对于这个问题，列宁在关于“粮食税”的一些著作以及有名的“合作社计划”中，给了回答。
    列宁的回答可以简括如下：
    （甲）不要放过夺取政权的有利条件，无产阶级应该夺取政权，不要等待到资本主义使千百万中小个体生产者居民破产的时候；
    （乙）剥夺工业中的生产资料，并把它们转归全民所有；
    （丙）至于中小个体生产者，那就要逐渐地把他们联合到生产合作社中，即联合到大规模的农业企业、集体农庄中；
    （丁）以一切方法发展工业，为集体农庄建立大规模生产的现代技术基础，并且不要剥夺集体农庄，相反地，要加紧供给它们头等拖拉机和其他机器；
    （戊）为了城市和乡村、工业和农业的经济结合，要在一定时期内保持商品生产（通过买卖的交换）这个为农民唯一可以接受的与城市进行经济联系的形式，并且要以全力展开苏维埃贸易，即国营贸易和合作社—集体农庄贸易，把所有一切资本家从商品流通中排挤出去。
    我国社会主义建设的历史，证明列宁所策画的这条发展道路是完全正确的。
    不容置疑，对于一切具有人数相当众多的中小生产者阶级的资本主义国家，这条发展道路是使社会主义获得胜利的唯一可能的和适当的道路。
    有人说，商品生产在任何条件下总还是要引导到而且一定会引导到资本主义。这是不对的。并非在任何时候，也不是在任何条件下都是如此！不能把商品生产和资本主义生产看成一样。这是两种不同的东西。资本主义生产是商品生产的最高形式。只有存在着生产资料的私有制，只有劳动力作为商品出现在市场上，资本家能够购买它并在生产过程中剥削它，因而只有在国内存在着资本家剥削雇佣工人的制度时，商品生产才会引导到资本主义。资本主义生产是在这样的场合开始的，即生产资料是集中在私人手中，而被剥夺了生产资料的工人不得不把自己的劳动力作为商品出卖。没有这种情形，就没有资本主义生产。
    但是，如果没有具备这些使商品生产转化为资本主义生产的条件，如果生产资料已经不是私有财产而是社会主义财产，如果雇佣劳动制度已经不存在，而劳动力已经不是商品，如果剥削制度早已消灭，那又怎么样呢？可不可以认为商品生产总还会引导到资本主义呢？不，不可以这样认为。要知道，我国社会正是生产资料私有制度、雇佣劳动制度、剥削制度早已不存在了的社会。
    决不能把商品生产看作是某种不依赖周围经济条件而独立自在的东西。商品生产比资本主义生产更老些。它在奴隶制度下就存在过，并且替奴隶制度服务过，然而并没有引导到资本主义。它在封建制度下就存在过，并且替封建制度服务过，可是，虽然它为资本主义生产准备了若干条件，却没有引导到资本主义。如果注意到，在我国，商品生产没有像在资本主义条件下那样漫无限制和包罗一切地扩展着，商品生产由于生产资料公有制的建立、雇佣劳动制度的消灭和剥削制度的消灭等决定性的经济条件，而受到极严格的限制，试问，为什么商品生产就不能在一定时期内同样地为我国社会主义社会服务而并不引导到资本主义呢？
    有人说，在我国生产资料公有制已经建立，而雇佣劳动制度和剥削制度已被消灭以后，商品生产的存在就失去了意义，因此就应该消除商品生产。
    这也是不对的。现今在我国，存在着社会主义生产的两种基本形式：一种是国家的全民的形式、一种是不能叫作全民的集体农庄的形式。在国家企业中，生产资料和产品是全民的财产。在集体农庄的企业中，虽然生产资料（土地、机器）也属于国家，可是产品却是个别集体农庄的财产；因为集体农庄中的劳动也如种籽一样，是它们自己所有的，而国家交给集体农庄永久使用的土地，集体农庄事实上是作为自己的财产来支配的，虽然它们不能出卖、购买、出租或抵押这些土地。
    这种情况就使得国家所能支配的只是国家企业的产品，至于集体农庄的产品，只有集体农庄才能作为自己的财产来支配。然而，集体农庄只愿以商品的形式把自己的产品转让出来，愿意以这种商品换得它们所需要的商品。现时，除了经过商品的联系，除了通过买卖的交换以外，与城市的其他经济联系，都是集体农庄所不接受的。因此，商品生产和商品流通，目前在我国，也像大约三十年以前当列宁宣布必须以全力扩展商品流通时一样，乃是必要的东西。
    当然，在出现了有权支配全国一切消费品的一个无所不包的生产部门，来代替两种基本生产部门即国营部门和集体农庄部门之后，商品流通及其“货币经济”就会作为国民经济的不必要的因素而消失了。但是，只要这个条件还不具备，只要还存在着两种基本生产部门的时候，商品生产和商品流通便应当作为我国国民经济体系中必要的和极其有用的因素而仍然保存着。怎样来建立这种单一的统一的部门呢？是让国营部门干脆吞没集体农庄部门，——而这是很难设想的（因为这会被了解为对集体农庄的剥夺），——还是组织统一的全民的（有国家工业和集体农庄代表参加的）经济机构，即起初有权统计全国一切消费品，而经过一个时期也有权例如以产品交换方式来分配产品的经济机构呢？这是一个特别的、需要单独讨论的问题。
    可见，我国的商品生产并不是通常的商品生产，而是特种的商品生产，是没有资本家参加的商品生产，这种商品生产基本上是与联合的社会主义生产者（国家、集体农庄、合作社）的商品有关的。它的活动范围只限于个人消费品。显然，它决不能发展为资本主义生产，而且它注定了要和它的“货币经济”一起共同为发展和巩固社会主义生产的事业服务。
    所以，有一些同志的意见是完全不对的，他们宣称，既然社会主义社会不消灭商品生产形式，那末在我国似乎就应当恢复资本主义所特有的一切经济范畴：作为商品的劳动力、剩余价值、资本、资本利润、平均利润率等等。这些同志把商品生产和资本主义生产混为一谈，认为既然有商品生产，就应该有资本主义生产。他们不了解，我国的商品生产是与资本主义制度下的商品生产根本不同的。
    并且我以为，也必须抛弃从马克思专门分析资本主义的“资本论”中取来而硬套在我国社会主义关系上的其他若干概念。就中我是指这样的一些概念，如“必要”劳动和“剩余”劳动、“必要”产品和“剩余”产品、“必要”时间和“剩余”时间。马克思分析资本主义，是为了说明工人阶级受剥削的泉源、即剩余价值，并且给予被剥夺了生产资料的工人阶级以推翻资本主义的精神武器。显然，马克思在这里所使用的概念（范畴）是与资本主义关系完全适合的。但是现在，当工人阶级不仅没有被剥夺政权和生产资料，反而掌握着政权和占有生产资料的时候，还使用这些概念，这是非常奇怪的。现在，在我国制度下，说劳动力是商品，说工人“被雇佣”，这真是十分荒谬的，好像占有生产资料的工人阶级自己被自己雇佣，把自己的劳动力出卖给自己一样。现在讲到“必要”劳动和“剩余”劳动，也是同样奇怪的：仿佛在我国条件下，交给社会以便用来扩大生产、发展教育和保健事业以及组织国防等等的工人劳动，对于现在掌握政权的工人阶级，并不是像用来满足工人及其家庭的个人需要的劳动那样必要的。
    应该指出，马克思在他已经不是研究资本主义而是也顺便研究共产主义社会第一阶段的
    “哥达纲领批判”中，承认交给社会来扩大生产、办理教育和保健事业、支付管理费、建立后备物资等等的劳动，是与用来满足工人阶级消费需要的劳动同样必要的。
    我以为，我们的经济学家应当消除旧概念和我们社会主义国家新情况之间这种不相适合的现象，而用适合新情况的新概念来代替旧概念。
    我们能容忍这种不适合的现象到一定的时候，但是现在已经是我们应当最后肃清这种不适合的现象的时候了。
    三、关于社会主义制度下的价值法则问题
    有时人们问，在我国，在我们的社会主义制度下，价值法则是不是存在，是不是发生作用呢？
    是的，是存在的，是发生作用的。在有商品和商品生产的地方，也就不能没有价值法则。
    在我国，价值法则发生作用的范围，首先是包括商品流通，包括通过买卖的商品交换，包括主要是个人消费的商品的交换。在这里，在这个领域中，价值法则当然是在一定范围内保持着调节者的作用的。
    但是，价值法则的作用，并不限于商品流通范围内，同时也扩展到生产方面。诚然，价值法则在我国社会主义生产中，并没有调节的作用，可是它总还影响生产，这在领导生产时是不能不考虑到的。问题在于，为了抵偿生产过程中耗费的劳动力而必需的消费品，在我国是作为受价值法则支配的商品来生产和销售的。也正是在这里可以看出价值法则对生产的影响。因此，在我们的企业中，这样一些问题，如经济核算和赢利问题、成本问题、价格问题等等，就具有现实的意义。所以，我们的企业是不能不而且不应该不考虑到价值法则的。
    这好不好呢？这并不坏。在我国现今条件下，这的确不坏，因为这种情况教育我们的经济工作人员来合理进行生产，并使他们遵守纪律。其所以不坏，是因为这种情况教我们的经济工作人员计算生产量，精确地计算生产量，并且同样精确地估量生产中的现实事物，而不去侈谈凭空想出来的“大概数字”。其所以不坏，是因为这种情况教我们的经济工作人员寻求、发现和利用生产内部潜在的后备力量，而不去糟蹋它们。其所以不坏，是因为这种情况教我们的经济工作人员不断地改进生产方法，降低生产成本，实现经济核算，并使企业能够赢利。这是很好的实践的学校，它加速我们经济工作干部的成长，加速把他们变成现今发展阶段上真正的社会主义生产领导者。
    糟糕的并不是价值法则影响我国的生产。糟糕的是我们的经济工作人员和计划工作人员，除了少数的例外，对于价值法则所发生的作用知道得很差，不研究这种作用，不善于在自己的核算中考虑这种作用。这的确也就说明，为什么在价格政策问题方面，我国还存在有一些混乱现象。这里是许许多多例子中的一个：不久以前，为了植棉业的利益，曾经决定调整棉花和谷物的比价，确定售给植棉者的谷物价格，并提高交售给国家的棉花价格。于是，我们的经济工作人员和计划工作人员就提出了不能不使中央委员们惊异的建议。因为按照这个建议，一吨谷物的价格差不多和一吨棉花的价格一样，同时一吨谷物的价格和一吨面包的价格相等。中央委员们指出：由于磨粉和烘烤的额外费用，一吨面包的价格应当高于一吨谷物的价格；棉花一般应当比谷物值钱得多，棉花和谷物的世界市场价格也证明了这一点。而建议人对于中央委员们的这些意见，没有能够说出任何明白的道理来。因此，中央只得亲自来处理这件事情，降低谷价，提高棉价。假如这些同志们的建议获得了法律上的效力，结果会怎样呢？那我们就会使植棉者破产，就会没有棉花。
    然而，这一切是不是说价值法则在我国有像在资本主义制度下同样广阔的发生作用的场所，价值法则在我国是生产的调节者呢？不，不是这个意思。事实上，在我国的经济制度下，价值法则的作用是被严格地限制在一定范围内的。前面已经说过，在我国的经济制度下，商品生产的活动是限制在一定范围内的。关于价值法则发生作用的范围，也必须这样说。无疑地，在城市和农村中，没有生产资料私有制，以及把生产资料公有化，就不会不限制价值法则发生作用的范围及其对生产的影响程度。
    在同一方向发生作用的，是国民经济有计划的（按比例的）发展的法则，这个法则代替了竞争和生产无政府状态的法则。
    在同一方向发生作用的，是我国的各个年度计划和五年计划以及我国一般的整个的经济政策，它们都是以国民经济有计划发展法则的要求为依据的。
    这一切就使得价值法则在我国发生作用的范围受到了严格的限制。在我国的制度下，价值法则不会起生产调节者的作用。
    这的确也就说明了这个“令人惊异”的事实：虽然我国的社会主义生产有不断的和蓬勃的发展，价值法则在我国却没有引导到生产过剩的危机，可是在资本主义制度下有广阔作用范围的同一个价值法则，虽然资本主义国家的生产发展速度很低，却引导到周期性的生产过剩的危机。
    有人说，价值法则是一切历史发展时期都一定适用的恒久的法则。如果价值法则在共产主义社会第二阶段时期会丧失其为交换关系调节者的效力，那末它在这个发展阶段中仍将保持其为各个不同生产部门关系的调节者、各个不同生产部门劳动分配的调节者的效力。
    这是完全不对的。正如价值法则一样，价值是与商品生产的存在相关联的一种历史范畴。商品生产一消失，价值连同它的各种形式以及价值法则，也都要随之消失。
    在共产主义社会的第二阶段上，用于生产产品的劳动量，将不是以曲折迂回的方法，不是凭借价值及其各种形式来计算，如像在商品生产制度下的情形那样，而是直接以耗费在生产产品上的时间数量、钟点数量来计算的。至于说到劳动分配，那末各个生产部门间的劳动分配，将不依靠那时已失去效力的价值法则来调节，而是依靠社会对产品的需要量的增长来调节的。这将是这样一种社会，在那里，生产将由社会的需要来调节，而计算社会的需要，对于计划机关将具有头等重要的意义。
    下面这个论断也是完全不正确的，就是说在我们现今的经济制度下，即在共产主义社会发展的第一阶段上，价值法则仿佛调节着各个不同生产部门间劳动分配的“比例”。
    假如这是正确的，那就不能理解，为什么在我国，没有用全力去发展那比起往往赢利较少而且有时简直不能赢利的重工业说来是最能赢利的轻工业？
    假如这是正确的，那就不能理解，为什么在我国，不关闭许多暂时还不能赢利、而且工人的劳动在其中不能产生“应有效果”的重工业企业，也不开设确实能赢利、而且工人的劳动在其中能产生“巨大效果”的轻工业的新企业？
    假如这是正确的，那就不能理解，为什么在我国，不依据仿佛调节着各个不同生产部门间劳动分配的“比例”的价值法则，把工人从对于国民经济虽很需要但赢利很少的企业，调到更能赢利的企业中去？
    显而易见，如果追随着这些同志的脚步走去，那我们就不得不把生产资料生产的首要地位让给消费资料的生产。然而，放弃生产资料生产的首要地位，又是什么意思呢？这就是说，消灭我国国民经济不断增长的可能性，因为如果不同时实现生产资料生产的首要地位，就不可能造成国民经济不断的增长。
    这些同志忘记了，价值法则只是在资本主义制度之下，在生产资料私有制存在之下，在竞争和生产无政府状态、生产过剩的危机存在之下，才能是生产的调节者。他们忘记了，在我国，价值法则发生作用的范围是被生产资料公有制的存在、被国民经济有计划发展的法则的作用所限制的，因而，也被大致反映这个法则的要求的我国各个年度计划和五年计划所限制的。
    某些同志由此作出结论说，国民经济有计划发展的法则与国民经济的计划化，消灭着生产赢利的原则。这是完全不对的。情形正好相反。如果不从个别企业或个别生产部门的观点，不从一年的时间来考察赢利，而是从整个国民经济的观点，从比方十年到十五年的时间来考察赢利（这是唯一正确处理问题的方法），那末，个别企业或个别生产部门暂时的不牢固的赢利，就决不能与牢固的经久的高级赢利形式相比拟，这种高级赢利形式是国民经济有计划发展法则的作用及国民经济计划化所提供给我们的，因为它们使我们避免那种破坏国民经济并给社会带来巨大物质损害的周期性的经济危机，而保证我国国民经济有高速度的不断增长。
    简略地说：不容置疑，在我国现今的社会主义生产条件下，价值法则不能是各个不同生产部门间劳动分配方面的“比例调节者”。
    四、关于消灭城市和乡村间、脑力劳动和体力劳动间的对立的问题以及关于消灭它们之间的差别的问题
    这个标题涉及许多本质上互不相同的问题，但是我把它们都合并在一章中，这不是把它们混为一谈，而唯一是为了阐述上的简要。
    关于消灭城市和乡村间、工业和农业间的对立的问题，是马克思和恩格斯早已提出的大家知道的问题。这个对立的经济基础，是资本主义制度下工业、商业、信贷制度的整个发展进程使乡村遭受城市剥削，使农民遭受剥夺，使大多数农村人口遭受破产。因此，资本主义制度下的城市和乡村间的对立，应该看作是利益上的对立。在这个基础上产生了农村对城市、对一般“城里人”的敌对关系。
    无疑地，在我国，随着资本主义和剥削制度的消灭，随着社会主义制度的巩固，而城市和乡村利益的对立、工业和农业利益的对立也必定消失。事情也正是这样发生了的。社会主义城市、我国工人阶级在消灭地主和富农的事业上所给予我国农民的巨大帮助，巩固了工人阶级和农民的联盟的基础，而有系统地供给农民及其集体农庄以头等的拖拉机和其他机器，更使工人阶级与农民的联盟变成了他们之间的友谊。当然，工人和集体农庄农民，仍然是两个在地位上彼此不同的阶级。但是这个差别丝毫不削弱他们的友谊关系。恰恰相反，他们的利益是位置在一条共同线上，位置在巩固社会主义制度和争取共产主义胜利的共同线上。因此，过去乡村对城市的不信任，尤其是对城市的憎恨，连一点影子都没有了，这是毫不奇怪的。
    这一切都表明，城市和乡村间、工业和农业间的对立的基础，已经被我国现今的社会主义制度消灭了。
    当然，这不是说，城市和乡村间对立的消灭应当引导到“大城市的灭亡”（见恩格斯的
    “反杜林论”）。不仅大城市不会灭亡，并且还要出现新的大城市，它们是文化最发达的中心，它们不仅是大工业的中心，而且是农产品加工和一切食品工业部门强大发展的中心。这种情况将促进全国文化的繁荣，并使乡村的生活条件向城市看齐。
    关于消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的对立的问题，我们有类似的情况。这个问题也是马克思和恩格斯早已提出的大家知道的问题。脑力劳动和体力劳动对立的经济基础，是脑力劳动者对体力劳动者的剥削。大家知道，在资本主义制度下，企业中体力劳动者与领导人员之间是存在着分裂的。大家知道，工人对待厂长、工长、工程师及其他技术人员就好像对待自己的敌人一样的那种敌对态度，就是在这个分裂的基础上发展起来的。显然，随着资本主义和剥削制度的消灭，体力劳动和脑力劳动间利益的对立也必定消失。它在我国现今的社会主义制度下，确实也消失了。现在体力劳动者与领导人员并不是敌人，而是同志和朋友，都是一个统一生产集体的成员，都极端关心生产的进步和改善，他们之间过去的仇视连一点影子也没有了。
    至于消灭城市（工业）和乡村（农业）间、体力劳动和脑力劳动间的差别的问题，却完全是另一种性质的问题。这个问题没有被马克思主义的经典著作家们提出来过。这是我国社会主义建设的实践所提出的新问题。
    这个问题是不是臆造出来的呢？它对于我们有没有什么实践的或理论的意义呢？决不能把这个问题看作是臆造出来的。恰恰相反，它对于我们是极其重要的问题。
    例如，如果拿农业和工业的差别来说，那末在我国，这种差别不仅由于农业的劳动条件与工业的劳动条件不同，而首先和主要是由于在工业中我们有生产资料和产品的全民所有制，而在农业中我们却没有全民所有制，只有集团的、集体农庄的所有制。前面已经说过，这种情况引导到商品流通的保存，只有工业和农业间的这个差别消失时，商品生产及其一切后果才会随之消灭。因而，不能否认，农业和工业间的这个本质差别的消失，对于我们应当有头等重要的意义。
    关于消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动间本质差别的问题，也必须这样说。这个问题对于我们也有头等重要的意义。在开始展开群众性的社会主义竞赛以前，我国工业的发展是进行得并不顺当的，有许多同志甚至提出了要降低工业发展速度的问题。这主要是由于当时工人的文化技术水平太低，远远落后于技术人员的水平。然而当社会主义竞赛在我国已具有群众性的时候，情形就根本改变了。正是在这以后，工业就以加快的速度向前迈进了。为什么社会主义竞赛具有了群众性呢？因为在工人中间有了整批整批的同志，他们不仅掌握了基本的技术知识，而且更前进了，与技术人员站在同一水平上，开始纠正技师和工程师的缺点，打破已经陈旧的现行定额，采用新的更加现代化的定额等等。假如不是少数工人，而是大多数工人都把自己的文化技术水平提高到了工程技术人员的水平，结果会怎么样呢？那我国的工业就会提高到其他各国工业所不能达到的高度。因而，不能否认，用提高工人文化技术水平到技术人员水平的办法，来消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动间的本质差别，对于我们是不能不有头等重要意义的。
    某些同志断定说，经过一个时期，不仅工业和农业间、体力劳动和脑力劳动间的本质差别会消失，而且它们之间的任何差别也会消失。这是不对的。工业和农业间本质差别的消灭，不能引导到它们之间任何差别的消灭。由于工业和农业中的工作条件有差别，工业和农业间的某种差别虽然是非本质的，无疑是会存在的。甚至在工业中，如果指的是各种不同的部门，那末工作条件也不是到处一样：例如，煤矿工人的工作条件不同于机械化鞋厂工人的工作条件，采矿工人的工作条件不同于机器制造业工人的工作条件。如果这是对的，那末工业和农业间的某些差别，就更加要保存下来了。
    关于脑力劳动和体力劳动间的差别，也必须这样说。它们之间就文化技术水平悬殊来说的本质差别，无疑是会消失的。但是某种非本质的差别还会保存下来，至少是因为企业领导人员的工作条件与工人的工作条件不一样。
    持有相反论断的同志们，大概是依据我的某些言论中大家知道的一个说法，在那里说到了工业和农业间、体力劳动和脑力劳动间的差别的消灭，而没有附带说明，那是指本质差别的消灭，而不是一切差别的消灭。同志们正是这样了解了我的说法，即认定了它的意思是说一切差别的消灭。但这就表明，这个说法是不确切的，不能令人满意的。必须把它抛掉，用另一个说法，即用工业和农业间、体力劳动和脑力劳动间本质差别的消灭与非本质差别的保存的说法去代替它。
    五、关于统一的世界市场的瓦解与世界资本主义体系危机加深的问题
    第二次世界大战及其经济影响在经济方面的最重要的结果，必须认为是统一的无所不包的世界市场的瓦解。这个情况决定了世界资本主义体系总危机的进一步加深。
    第二次世界大战本身就是由这种危机产生的。在战争时期互相撕打的两个资本主义同盟，其中每一个都指望粉碎敌方，而获得世界霸权，它们曾想从这里寻找摆脱危机的出路。美国指望击溃自己最危险的竞争者德国和日本，攫取国外市场、世界的原料资源，并取得世界霸权。
    然而战争使这些指望落空了。诚然，作为美、英、法三个主要资本主义国家竞争者的德国和日本是被击溃了。但同时，中国和其他欧洲各人民民主国家却脱离了资本主义体系，和苏联一起形成了统一的和强大的社会主义阵营，而与资本主义阵营相对立。两个对立阵营存在之经济结果，就是统一的无所不包的世界市场瓦解了，因而现在就有了两个平行的也是互相对立的世界市场。
    应该指出，美国、英国、法国自己促成了这个新的平行的世界市场的形成和巩固，当然这不是出于它们的本意。它们对于苏联、中国和没有加入“马歇尔计划”体系的欧洲各人民民主国家实行经济封锁，想以此窒杀它们。事实上却并没有窒杀得了，反而巩固了这个新的市场。
    当然，在这方面主要的事情还不在于经济封锁，而是在于战后时期中这些国家在经济上结合起来了，并且建立好了经济上的合作和互助。这个合作的经验表明，没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。结果，在这些国家中便有了高速度的工业发展。可以满怀信心地说，在这样高的工业发展速度之下，很快就会使得这些国家不仅不需要从资本主义国家输入商品，而且它们自己还会感到必须把自己生产的多余商品输往他国。
    但是，由此可以得出结论说：各主要资本主义国家（美、英、法）攫取世界资源的范围，将不会扩大而会缩小；世界销售市场的条件对于这些国家将会恶化，而这些国家的企业开工不足的现象将会增大。这也就是由于世界市场瓦解而使世界资本主义体系总危机加深的原因。
    这是资本家们自己也感觉到的，因为失去像苏联和中国这样的市场是很难不感觉到的。他们竭力想用“马歇尔计划”、侵朝战争、军备竞争、工业军事化来弥补这些困难情况。但是这很像快要淹死的人抓住一根草一样。
    由于这种情况，在经济学家面前便出现了两个问题：
    （甲）可不可以断言，斯大林在第二次世界大战以前所提出的大家知道的论点，即关于资本主义总危机时期市场相对稳定的论点，仍旧有效呢？
    （乙）可不可以断言，列宁在一九一六年春天所发表的大家知道的论点，即资本主义虽然腐朽，但“整个说来，资本主义却较以前发展得更迅速无比”的论点，仍旧有效呢？
    我以为，不可以这样断言。由于有第二次世界大战产生的新条件，这两个论点都应该认为是已经失效了的。
    六、关于资本主义国家间战争不可避免的问题
    某些同志断定说，由于第二次世界大战后新的国际条件的发展，资本主义国家间的战争已经不再是不可避免的了。他们认为：社会主义阵营和资本主义阵营间的矛盾，是比资本主义国家间的矛盾更为剧烈；美国把其他资本主义国家已经控制到了这种程度，能够不让它们互相作战和彼此削弱；资本主义的先进分子对于给整个资本主义世界带来严重伤害的两次世界大战的经验教训已经体会到这种程度，不会让自己再把资本主义国家卷入相互间的战争中，——由于这一切，资本主义国家间的战争便不再是不可避免的了。
    这些同志错了。他们只看见在表面上闪现着的外表现象，而没有看见那些暂时虽还未明显地发生作用，但终究会决定事变进程的潜在力量。
    从外表上看来，一切都好像是“平安无事”的；美国已使西欧、日本和其他资本主义国家仰其配给；德国（西德）、英国、法国、意大利、日本都陷入了美国的铁爪中，顺从地执行着美国的意旨。但是如果以为，这种“平安无事”会“永世地”保存下去，以为这些国家将无止境地忍受美国的统治和压迫，以为它们不会设法挣脱美国的镣铐，而走上独立发展的道路，那就错了。
    我们首先看一看英国和法国吧。无疑地，这两个都是帝国主义国家。无疑地，廉价的原料和有保证的销售市场，对于它们具有头等重要的意义。可不可以设想，当美国人在“马歇尔计划”“援助”的叫嚣下，打入英国和法国的经济，竭力把它变成美国经济的附属品，当美国资本在英、法殖民地攫取原料和销售市场，从而准备使英、法资本家的高额利润遭到大崩溃，而英法两国竟会无止境地忍受现在的这种情况呢？如果说，资本主义的英国，接着还有资本主义的法国，归根到底将不得不从美国的怀抱里挣脱出来，同美国发生冲突，以便保证自己有独立地位，当然也保证自己有高额的利润，这是不是更正确些呢？
    我们现在来看一看主要的战败国德国（西德）和日本吧。这两个国家现在在美国帝国主义的铁蹄下过着可怜的生活。它们的工业和农业，它们的商业，它们的对外政策和对内政策，它们的整个生活，都被美国的占领“制度”加上了镣铐。要知道，这些国家昨天还是震撼了英国、美国、法国在欧洲和亚洲统治基础的强大帝国主义国家。如果认为这些国家不会设法重新站起来，打破美国的“制度”，奔上独立发展的道路，——这就等于相信神怪。
    有人说，资本主义和社会主义间的矛盾比资本主义国家间的矛盾更为剧烈。从理论上讲来，这当然是对的。这不仅在现时、在目前是对的，就在第二次世界大战以前也是对的。这是资本主义国家领导者们也多少懂得的。然而，第二次世界大战终究不是从对苏联作战开始，而是从资本主义国家间的战争开始的。为什么呢？第一，因为对于资本主义说来，对苏联作战、即对社会主义国家作战，是比资本主义国家间的战争更加危险，因为资本主义国家间的战争所提出的问题，只是某些资本主义国家对其他资本主义国家取得优势的问题，而对苏联作战所一定要提出的问题，却是资本主义本身存亡的问题。第二，因为资本家虽然为了“宣传”的目的叫嚷什么苏联的侵略，可是他们自己也不相信有苏联的侵略，因为他们估计到苏联的和平政策，并且知道苏联自己是不会进攻资本主义国家的。
    在第一次世界大战以后，人们也曾经认为德国是被彻底击溃了，正如现在某些同志认为日本和德国是被彻底击溃了一样。当时人们在报刊上也谈论和叫嚷美国已使欧洲仰其配给，说德国再也不能站起来，说从此以后，资本主义国家间的战争再也不会发生了。虽然如此，但是，德国却在被打败后，经过这么十五年到二十年的工夫，又从奴役下挣脱出来，走上了独立发展的道路，作为一个强国站立起来并站住了脚。同时值得注意的是，帮助德国在经济上站立起来并提高它的军事经济潜力的不是别人，而正是英国和美国。当然，美国和英国帮助德国在经济上站立起来时，是打算指使已经站立起来的德国来反对苏联，即利用它来反对社会主义国家的。然而，德国却首先用自己的力量去反对英、法、美集团。而当希特勒德国向苏联宣战的时候，英、法、美集团不仅没有与希特勒德国联合起来，反而不得不同苏联结成联盟来反对希特勒德国。
    可见，当时资本主义国家间争夺市场的斗争以及它们想把自己的竞争者淹死的愿望，在实践上是比资本主义阵营和社会主义阵营间的矛盾更为剧烈。
    试问，有什么保证使德国和日本不重新站立起来，不设法挣脱美国的镣铐，从而过自己的独立生活呢？我以为这样的保证是没有的。
    由此可见，资本主义国家间战争的不可避免性是仍然存在的。
    有人说，既然现今已经有强大的人民力量成长起来，它们正在保卫和平反对新的世界大战，所以列宁关于帝国主义不可避免地要产生战争的这个论点，应该认为是已经过了时的。这种说法是不对的。
    现今的和平运动，其目的是唤起人民群众去为维护和平、防止新的世界大战而斗争。因而，它所抱的目的不是推翻资本主义和建立社会主义，——它只限于为维护和平而斗争的民主目的。这就是现今维护和平的运动与第一次世界大战时期变帝国主义战争为国内战争的运动不同的地方，因为后一运动曾经走得远些，它抱有社会主义的目的。
    可能，在各种情况的一定凑合下，争取和平的斗争会在某个地方爆发成争取社会主义的斗争，但这将不再是当前的和平运动，而是推翻资本主义的运动了。
    最可能的，当前的和平运动、即保持和平的运动在获得胜利时，就会使新的战争得以防止，使新的战争暂时延缓，使当前和平暂时维持，使好战政府辞职而代之以别的愿意暂时维持和平的政府。这当然是好的。甚至是很好的。但是，这仍然不足以根本消灭资本主义国家间战争的不可避免性。其所以不足，是因为纵然有保卫和平运动的这一切胜利，但帝国主义仍然保持，仍然存在，因而战争之不可避免性也仍然是存在的。
    要消灭战争的不可避免性，就必须消灭帝国主义。
    七、关于现代资本主义和社会主义的基本经济法则问题
    大家知道，资本主义和社会主义的基本经济法则问题曾经几次在讨论会上提出过。在这方面发表过各种不同的意见，直到最荒谬的意见。诚然，大多数参加讨论的人，对于这个问题反应得很少，而且在这方面没有作出任何决定。可是，参加讨论的人谁也没有否认这些法则的存在。
    资本主义的基本经济法则是不是存在呢？是的，是存在的。这法则是什么呢？它的特点何在呢？资本主义的基本经济法则是这样一种法则，它不是决定资本主义生产发展的某一个别方面或某些个别过程，而是决定资本主义生产发展的一切主要方面和一切主要过程，因而是决定资本主义生产的实质、决定资本主义生产的本质的。
    价值法则是不是资本主义的基本经济法则呢？不是的。价值法则首先是商品生产的法则。它像商品生产一样，在资本主义以前就存在过，而且在推翻资本主义以后，例如在我国，也继续存在着，诚然，它发生作用的范围是被限制了的。价值法则在资本主义条件下有广阔的作用范围，它在发展资本主义生产方面发生很大的作用，但是它不仅不决定资本主义生产的实质和资本主义利润的基础，甚至没有提出这样的问题。所以，价值法则不能是现代资本主义的基本经济法则。
    依据同一理由，竞争和生产无政府状态的法则，或各国资本主义发展不平衡的法则，都不能是资本主义的基本经济法则。
    有人说，平均利润率的法则是现代资本主义的基本经济法则。这是不对的。现代资本主义即垄断资本主义不能满足于平均利润，加之这种平均利润由于资本有机构成的增高，还有下降的趋势。现代垄断资本主义所要求的不是平均利润，而是相当经常地实现扩大再生产所必需的最大限度的利润。
    最适合于资本主义的基本经济法则这个概念的，是剩余价值法则，即资本主义利润的产生和增殖的法则。这个法则真正预先决定资本主义生产的基本特点。然而，剩余价值的法则是过于一般的法则，它没有涉及最高利润率的问题，而保证这种利润率却是垄断资本主义发展的条件。要弥补这个缺陷，就必须把剩余价值法则具体化，把它发展起来适应于垄断资本主义的条件，同时要考虑到，垄断资本主义所要求的不是随便什么利润，而正是最大限度的利润。这才会是现代资本主义的基本经济法则。
    现代资本主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求，可以大致表述如下：用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。
    有人说，总可以认为平均利润对于资本主义在现今条件下的发展还是足够的。这是不对的。平均利润是最低限度的赢利，再低下去，资本主义生产就会成为不可能了。但是，如果认为现代垄断资本主义的头子夺取殖民地、奴役各国人民、策动战争所力求给自己保证的不过是平均利润，那就可笑了。不，不是平均利润，也不是那照例比平均利润稍为高些的超额利润，而正是最大限度的利润才是垄断资本主义的发动力。正由于必须取得最大限度的利润，才推动垄断资本主义去采取这样冒险的步骤，如奴役和不断掠夺殖民地和其他落后国家，把许多独立国变为附属国，组织新战争、即现代资本主义的头子们认为是取得最大限度利润的最好“生意”，以及企图攫取世界的经济霸权。
    资本主义基本经济法则的意义也就在于，这个法则既然决定资本主义生产方式发展方面
    一切最重要的现象，既然决定资本主义生产的高涨和危机，它的胜利和失败，它的长处和短处，——它的矛盾发展的全部过程，——便使我们能够了解和说明这一切现象。
    请看许许多多“令人惊异”的例子中的一个例子。
    大家知道，在资本主义的历史和实践中，有过表明资本主义制度下技术蓬勃发展的事实，那时资本家表现为先进技术的旗手、生产技术发展方面的革命家。但是大家同样知道，也有过另一种表明资本主义制度下技术终止发展的事实，那时资本家是表现为新技术发展方面的反动者，并常常转而使用手工劳动。
    怎样来说明这种惊人的矛盾呢？只有用现代资本主义的基本经济法则，即用取得最大限度利润的必要性才能加以说明。当新技术向资本主义预示着最大利润的时候，资本主义就拥护新技术。当新技术不再预示着最大利润的时候，资本主义就反对新技术，主张转而采用手工劳动。
    关于现代资本主义基本经济法则的情形，就是如此。
    社会主义的基本经济法则是不是存在呢？是的，是存在的。这个法则的主要特点和要求何在呢？社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求，可以大致表述如下：用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    因而，不是保证最大限度的利润，而是保证最大限度地满足社会的物质和文化的需要；不是带有从高涨到危机以及从危机到高涨的间歇状态的生产发展，而是生产的不断增长；不是伴随着社会生产力的破坏而来的技术发展中的周期性的间歇状态，而是生产在高度技术基础上不断完善。
    有人说，社会主义的基本经济法则是国民经济有计划的、按比例的发展的法则。这是不对的。国民经济有计划的发展，也就是说，多少真实地反映这一法则的国民经济计划化，如果不知道国民经济有计划的发展是为着什么任务而进行，或者任务不明确，那它本身是不能提供出什么来的。国民经济有计划发展的法则，只是在具有国民经济的计划发展所要实现的任务时，才能产生应有的效果。国民经济有计划发展的法则本身并不能提供这个任务。国民经济计划化尤其不能提供这个任务。这个任务是包含在社会主义的基本经济法则中，即表现于这一法则的上述要求内。因此，国民经济有计划发展的法则的作用，只是在它以社会主义基本经济法则为依据时，才能充分发挥起来。
    至于说到国民经济的计划化，那末，它只有遵守下列两个条件时，才能得到良好的结果，这两个条件是：（甲）它正确地反映国民经济有计划发展的法则的要求，（乙）它在各方面适合社会主义基本经济法则的要求。
    八、其他问题
    （一）关于在封建制度下的经济外的强制问题
    当然，经济外的强制在巩固农奴制地主的经济权力方面起过作用，但封建制度的基础并不是经济外的强制，而是封建土地所有制。
    （二）关于集体农庄农户的个人财产问题
    如果教科书未定稿中说“集体农庄内每一农户有乳牛、小牲畜和家禽供个人使用”，那就不正确了。大家知道，事实上，乳牛、小牲畜、家禽等等不是供集体农庄内农户个人使用，而是农户的个人财产。“供个人使用”这个说法，大概是从农业劳动组合模范章程中搬来的。但在农业劳动组合模范章程中是有错误的。在更加缜密制定的苏联宪法中，则是另外一种说法，即是：
    “集体农庄内每一农户……拥有此园地上所有的副业，以及住宅、食用牲畜、家禽和小农具为其个人财产。”
    这当然是正确的。
    此外，应该更详细地说，每个集体农庄庄员按当地的条件，有一头到多少头乳牛，多少只绵羊、山羊、猪（也是按当地的条件由多少到多少）以及不限数量的家禽（鸭、鹅、鸡、火鸡）作为他个人的财产。
    这种详细叙述对于我们的外国同志是有巨大意义的，他们想确切知道，在我国实现了农业集体化以后，集体农庄内每一农户究竟还剩下有什么东西是他个人的财产。
    （三）关于农民交给地主的地租数额问题以及关于购买土地的费用数额问题
    在教科书未定稿中说，由于土地收归国有的结果，“农民免除了交给地主的地租，其总额每年约为五亿卢布”（应当说“金卢布”）。应该把这个数字弄准确，因为在我看来，这个数字所计算的并不是整个俄国的地租，而只是俄国大多数省份的地租。在这里必须注意到，在俄国的一些边区，地租是以实物缴纳的，看起来教科书未定稿的作者们没有考虑到这一点。此外，必须注意到，农民不仅免除了地租，而且也免除了每年购买土地的费用。教科书未定稿中是否考虑到了这一点呢？在我看来，并没有考虑到，然而这是应该考虑到的。
    （四）关于垄断组织与国家机关的结合问题
    “结合”这个名词是不适当的。这个名词在表面上和说法上是表明垄断组织和国家机关的接近，可是没有揭示这种接近的经济意义。问题在于，这种接近的过程中所发生的不单是结合，而是国家机关服从于垄断组织。因此，应该去掉“结合”这个名词，而代之以“国家机关服从于垄断组织”这个说法。
    （五）关于苏联使用机器的问题在教科书未定稿中说：“在苏联，在机器能给社会节省劳动的一切场合下，都是使用机器的。”这完全不是应有的说法。第一，机器在苏联总是给社会节省劳动的，因此我们不知道在苏联的条件下有机器不给社会节省劳动的情形。第二，机器不仅节省劳动，而且同时还减轻工作人员的劳动，因此，与资本主义的条件不同，在我国的条件下，工人是极乐意在劳动过程中利用机器的。
    所以应该说，没有任何地方像在苏联这样乐意使用机器，因为机器给社会节省劳动，并且减轻工人的劳动；由于在苏联没有失业的现象，所以工人极乐意在国民经济中使用机器。
    （六）关于资本主义国家内工人阶级的物质状况问题
    当人们谈到工人阶级的物质状况时，通常总是指生产中的在业工人，而没有估计到所谓失业后备军的物质状况。这样看待工人阶级物质状况的问题，是不是正确呢？我以为是不正确的。既然有失业后备军，而它的成员除了出卖自己的劳动力就无法生存，那末失业者是不能不列入工人阶级之中的，但是，既然他们列入工人阶级之中，那末他们的赤贫状况，就不能不影响生产中在业工人的物质状况。因此我以为，在说明资本主义国家工人阶级的物质状况时，也应该估计到失业工人后备军的状况。
    （七）关于国民收入的问题
    我以为，一定要在教科书未定稿内添进关于国民收入的新的一章。
    （八）关于教科书中有社会主义政治经济学创造者列宁和斯大林的专门一章的问题
    我以为，“马克思主义关于社会主义的学说。列宁和斯大林之创造社会主义政治经济学”这一章，应该从教科书里删去。它在教科书中是完全不需要的，因为它并未提供什么新东西，而只是无味地重复那些在前几章中已经比较详细讲过的东西。
    在其余的问题上，我对于奥斯特洛维疆诺夫、列昂捷夫、舍比洛夫、加托夫斯基和其他同志们的“建议”，没有什么意见。
    九、马克思主义政治经济学教科书的国际意义
    我以为，同志们没有估计到马克思主义政治经济学教科书的全部意义。这本教科书不仅对于我们苏联的青年是需要的。它对于各国共产党人以及一切同情共产党人的人们是特别需要的。我们的外国同志们想知道，我们是怎样挣脱了资本主义的镣铐的，我们是怎样以社会主义精神来改造了全国经济的，我们是怎样达到了与农民建立友好关系的，我们是怎样使得我们这个不久以前还是贫弱的国家变成了富强的国家的，什么是集体农庄，为什么我们虽然生产资料已经公有化了，但还没有消灭商品生产、货币、贸易等等。他们想知道这一切以及其他许多东西，并不是简单地为了好奇，而是要向我们学习，并为了自己的国家来利用我们的经验。因此，一本好的马克思主义政治经济学教科书的出版，不仅具有国内的政治意义，而且具有巨大的国际意义。
    因此，需要一本能成为不仅是国内革命青年而且是国外革命青年的必读的教科书。它的篇幅不应太大，因为篇幅太大的教科书不能作为必读书，而且很难把它领会、掌握。但是它应当包含有关我国经济以及资本主义和殖民地体系的经济的一切基本东西。
    某些同志在讨论时提议给教科书添进许多新的章节，历史家就历史方面、政治家就政治方面、哲学家就哲学方面、经济学家就经济方面提出这样的建议。但是，这会使得教科书的篇幅无限扩大。这当然是不能容许的。这本教科书是用历史方法来阐明政治经济学问题，但这不是说，我们应当把政治经济学教科书变成经济关系史。
    我们需要一本五百页至多不超过六百页的教科书。这将是马克思主义政治经济学的必读书，是给予世界各国年青共产党人的良好礼物。
    但是，由于外国大多数共产党的马克思主义理论水平不够，这样的教科书也会给予这些国家的非年青的共产党员干部以很大的好处。
    十、改善政治经济学教科书未定稿的办法
    某些同志在讨论时过于热心地“斥责”教科书未定稿，责骂作者们的错误和疏忽，肯定说未定稿失败了。这是不公正的。当然，教科书中是有错误和疏忽的，错误和疏忽在大事情中差不多总是有的。但是不管怎样，绝大多数参加讨论会的人终究承认，教科书未定稿可以作为将来教科书的基础，只要作若干修正和补充就可以了。的确，只要把这教科书未定稿和现在通行的政治经济学教科书比较一下，就可以得出结论说，这教科书未定稿是比现有的一切教科书高明得多的。教科书未定稿的作者们的巨大功绩，就在这里。
    我以为，要改善教科书未定稿，应该指派一个人数不多的委员会，其中不仅有教科书的作者们，不仅有赞成讨论会上大多数人的意见的人，而且有反对讨论会上大多数人意见和猛烈批评教科书未定稿的人。
    最好，委员会中也包括一位有经验的统计学家来检查数字并给未定稿添加新的统计材料，而且也包括一位有经验的法学家来检查措词的确切性。
    应该暂时解除委员会委员的其他任何工作，在物质方面给予他们充分的保证，使他们能够专心致力于教科书的编纂工作。
    此外，应该委派一个——比方说——由三个人组成来最后校审教科书的校审委员会，这对于求得文体的统一也是必要的，可惜在教科书未定稿中没有做到这一点。
    把最后定稿的教科书呈交中央的期限为一年。
