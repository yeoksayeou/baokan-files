The report discusses the period's characteristics: further stabilization of the internal situation in the Soviet Union, the development of the entire national economy, and socialist culture. After the closure of the 18th Party Congress, the Soviet people continued to successfully implement the third five-year plan, further strengthening the Soviet Union. During these years, significant achievements were made in the development of the national economy.

The peaceful labor of the Soviet people was interrupted by the treacherous attack by fascist Germany on the Soviet Union. The history of the Soviet state entered a difficult period—the Great Patriotic War. During this war, the working class, collective farmers, and Soviet intelligentsia demonstrated high consciousness and patriotism both on the front lines and in the rear.

After the Soviet Union's historic victory in the war, it entered a new period of peaceful economic development. The Soviet state, relying on its own human and material resources without external aid, quickly restored the economy damaged by the war and pushed it forward, surpassing the pre-war economic indicators.

Due to the progress in the recovery of industry and agriculture, we were able to abolish the rationing of food and industrial goods in 1947 and implement a currency reform. These measures, along with the five reductions in the prices of food and industrial goods, increased the purchasing power of the Soviet ruble and ensured an increase in the material well-being of the working people. In 1950, the ruble was converted to the gold standard, and its exchange rate increased.

The achievements in restoring and developing the economy enabled the Soviet state to undertake new major national economic tasks, including the construction of powerful hydroelectric stations on the Volga and Dnieper rivers, the excavation of large navigable canals and irrigation channels, and the planting of protective forest belts in vast regions of our country.

The historical events that occurred during the period under discussion show that the Soviet social and state system is not only the best organizational form for raising the economy and culture of our country during the years of peaceful construction but also the best organizational form for mobilizing all the forces of the people to repel the enemy during wartime. These events also show that the political activism of the working people has greatly increased, the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people around the Communist Party has been further strengthened, the brotherly cooperation of the peoples of the Soviet Union has been further strengthened, and Soviet patriotism has been further developed.

Our people are determined to continue to work selflessly for the happiness of the socialist motherland and to complete the historical task of building a communist society with glory. (Stormy, sustained applause)

I. Further Growth of the Soviet National Economy

A. Industry

During the pre-war years of several five-year plans, the Soviet Union achieved socialist industrialization. A powerful industry is the foundation for the development of the entire national economy and the preparation of active defense. The years of war particularly proved the correctness of our Party's policy of national industrialization. The implementation of the Soviet industrialization policy had a decisive significance for the fate of the Soviet people and saved our motherland from enslavement.

In the difficult conditions of war, the Party was able to quickly transfer industry to a wartime track. All the most important industrial enterprises were moved from the war zone to the eastern regions. During the war years, the Soviet state found within itself sufficient strength and resources not only to quickly put the relocated enterprises into operation but also to accelerate the establishment of new enterprises, mainly heavy industry plants. Although the fascist invaders temporarily occupied economically important regions of our country, our industry during the war produced various military equipment and ammunition for the front, and their quantities increased year by year.

With the end of the war, industry shifted from military production to civilian production. The Party set the task of first massively developing heavy industry—especially metallurgy, fuel, and power industries—because without heavy industry, it is impossible to solve the tasks of restoring and further developing the national economy. At the same time, the Party paid special attention to expanding the production of consumer goods to raise the living standards of the people.

It took a considerable amount of time to restore industrial production to pre-war levels. Industrial output reached and exceeded the pre-war level of 1940 in 1948, coal mining in 1947, steel and cement production in 1948, pig iron production and oil extraction in 1949, shoe production in 1950, and cotton textile production in 1951. This means that the war delayed our industrial development by about eight to nine years—approximately two five-year plan periods.

Due to the successful restoration and development of industry in the post-war years, the current level of industrial production is significantly higher than the pre-war period. Here are the figures for this:

Growth of Soviet Industrial Products
(1940 as 100)

| Year | Total Industrial Output | Output of Means of Production | Output of Consumer Goods |
|------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1940 | 100                     | 100                           | 100                       |
| 1944 | 104                     | 136                           | 54                        |
| 1945 | 92                      | 112                           | 59                        |
| 1946 | 77                      | 82                            | 67                        |
| 1947 | 93                      | 101                           | 82                        |
| 1948 | 118                     | 130                           | 99                        |
| 1949 | 141                     | 163                           | 107                       |
| 1950 | 173                     | 205                           | 123                       |
| 1951 | 202                     | 239                           | 143                       |
| 1952 | 223 (planned)           | 267 (planned)                | 156 (planned)             |

From these figures, it can be seen that in 1945 and 1946, the level of industrial production declined. This was due to the significant reduction in military-technical production after the war, and it took some time for industry to shift to a peaceful track. The adjustment of post-war industrial production was basically completed in 1946, after which the output of our industry began to rise rapidly. In 1951, the total industrial output was more than twice that of 1940. In 1952, our industry made further progress.

Everyone knows that this year's entire plan for industry is not only being successfully completed but is also being overfulfilled. Therefore, we have every reason to believe that the industrial output of 1952 will be approximately 2.3 times that of 1940. The industry producing means of production has developed particularly rapidly; its total output for 1951 was 2.4 times the pre-war level, and the total output for 1952 will be approximately 2.7 times the pre-war level. The output for 1952 will be as follows: pig iron 25 million tons, approximately 70% more than in 1940; steel 35 million tons, approximately 90% more than in 1940; rolled metal 27 million tons, more than twice the 1940 output; coal 300 million tons, more than 80% more than in 1940; oil 47 million tons, more than 50% more than in 1940; electricity 117 billion kilowatt-hours, 2.4 times the 1940 output; machinery and equipment will be more than three times the 1940 output.

Regarding the annual increase in the output of the most important industrial sectors, in recent years, it has been much faster than in the pre-war period. For example, in the last three years (1949-1951), during which not only the pre-war level of industrial production was restored but also exceeded, the output of pig iron increased by 8 million tons, steel by 13 million tons, and rolled metal by 10 million tons. In the pre-war period, to increase such large outputs, pig iron required 8 years, steel required 9 years, and rolled metal required 12 years. The coal mining output in these three years increased by 74 million tons, and oil by 13 million tons. In the pre-war period, to increase such large outputs, coal required 6 years, and oil required 10 years. The electricity output in these three years increased by 37 billion kilowatt-hours. In the pre-war period, to increase the electricity output by this much, it required 9 years.

The increase in the production of means of production and the development of agricultural output have provided a reliable foundation for the development of the consumer goods industry. The total output of this industry in 1951 was 43% higher than in 1940, and the output in 1952 will be approximately 60% higher than in 1940. The output figures for 1952 will be as follows: cotton textiles will exceed 5 billion meters, approximately 30% more than in 1940; wool textiles will be nearly 1.9 billion meters, approximately 60% more than in 1940; silk textiles 2.18 billion meters, 2.8 times the 1940 output; leather shoes 250 million pairs, approximately 20% more than in 1940; rubber shoes 125 million pairs, 80% more than in 1940; sugar 330 million tons, more than 50% more than in 1940; industrially processed animal oils 380,000 tons (a large amount of homemade oil is not included in this figure), which will be more than 70% higher than the pre-war industrial production of animal oils.

Due to the successful restoration and development of industry in the post-war period, the industrial output per capita in the Soviet Union has now exceeded the pre-war level. For example, in 1951, the output of electricity per capita was more than twice that of 1940, pig iron 50% more, steel 70% more, coal 60% more, cement more than twice, cotton textiles 20% more, wool textiles more than 60%, paper 70% more, etc.

During the period under discussion, especially in the post-war years, the productive base of our industry has been greatly expanded and consolidated due to the construction of new factories and the reconstruction of existing factories. In the period from 1946 to 1951, out of the total investment of approximately 500 billion rubles in the national economy, more than 320 billion rubles were invested in industry. During this period, approximately 7,000 large state industrial enterprises were restored and newly built and put into operation. Compared to 1940, the fixed productive assets of industry in 1952 had increased by 77%.

However, the issue is not just about the quantitative increase in fixed productive assets. Another characteristic of this past period is the continuous progress of industrial technology. In capitalist countries, technological development has periodic interruptions, accompanied by the destruction of social productive forces due to economic crises. In contrast, the Soviet Union has no economic crises, and its production is continuously improving thanks to high technology and the achievements of advanced Soviet science. In the post-war years, all industrial sectors were equipped with new machines and machinery, more perfect technological processes were applied, and production was more rationally organized. During this period, due to the addition of new machines with higher productivity, the number of machine tools increased to 2.2 times. In the past three years alone, the Soviet machine-building industry produced approximately 1,600 new types of machines and machinery.

Our science plays a huge role in promoting further technological development; it helps the Soviet people to understand the natural resources and forces more thoroughly and to utilize them more effectively. In the period after the end of the war, our scientists have successfully solved many scientific problems of great national economic significance. One of the most important achievements of Soviet science in this period is the discovery of the method of producing atomic energy. Thus, our science and technology have ended the monopoly of the United States in this field and dealt a serious blow to the warmongers who had tried to use the secret of atomic energy production and the possession of atomic weapons as a means of blackmailing and intimidating the peoples of other countries. Although the Soviet state has mastered the real possibility of producing atomic energy, it still hopes very much that this new type of energy will be used for peaceful purposes, for the happiness of the people, because the use of atomic energy in this way can infinitely expand human control over the spontaneous forces of nature, provide great possibilities for increasing productivity, progress in technology and culture, and increase social wealth.

The great achievements of Soviet science and technology can be seen from the annual awarding of the Stalin Prizes for outstanding scientific works, inventions, and fundamental improvements in production methods. A total of 8,470 scientists, industrialists, transport workers, and agricultural workers have been awarded the honor of Stalin Prize winners.

An important result of industrial development is the rapid development of the eastern regions of the Soviet Union during this period, which has greatly changed the distribution of industry in our country. The eastern regions—the Volga basin, the Urals, Siberia, the Far East, the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Central Asian republics—have established a powerful industrial base for our country. By 1952, the total industrial output of these regions had increased to three times that of 1940. In 1951, the industrial output of the eastern regions accounted for about one-third of the total industrial output of the Soviet Union, steel and rolled metal accounted for more than half, coal and oil accounted for nearly half, and electricity accounted for more than 40%.

These are the main achievements of the development of Soviet industry during the period discussed in the report.

The tasks for the development of industry in the coming years have been indicated in the draft directive on the fifth five-year plan of the Soviet Union, which has been submitted to this Congress for review. These tasks are: by 1955, to raise the level of industrial production to 70% higher than in 1950; the production of means of production will increase by approximately 80%, and the production of consumer goods will increase by approximately 65%. This increase in industrial production means that by 1955, the industrial production will be three times that of 1940.

The fifth five-year plan means that our country has taken another big step forward on the road from socialism to communism. (Applause)

Our industry has all the possibilities to complete the various tasks it will undertake. Today, all industrial sectors are equipped with more perfect machines, have skilled workers, engineers, and technical personnel, and industrial enterprises do not lack raw materials and materials. The problem now is to fully utilize these possibilities, resolutely eliminate all shortcomings in work, and tap the unused reserves in production and turn them into a powerful force for the development of the national economy.

Industry not only completes the state plan every year but also overfulfills it. However, the overall good work of the entire industry still covers up the poor work of many enterprises that have not completed the tasks assigned by the state, resulting in the national economy not obtaining a considerable amount of products. However, the government departments have not taken the necessary measures to ensure that each enterprise completes the plan, and often transfer the tasks originally assigned to poorly performing enterprises to advanced enterprises. Therefore, poorly performing enterprises rely on advanced enterprises to survive.

One of the main reasons why these enterprises have not been able to complete the state plan is that their production is uneven in each month. The Party has repeatedly pointed out this shortcoming to the leaders of the economy. However, even now, there are still many enterprises that work intermittently, completing almost half of the monthly production plan in the last ten days, which leads to underutilization of capacity, overtime work, increased waste, and hindrance to the work of related enterprises.

Some enterprises, in order to complete the total production plan, even resort to methods that are detrimental to the state interests, producing excessive secondary products, and not completing the tasks specified in the state plan for the production of extremely important products. Some industrial sectors violate the state standards for product quality. The facts of producing substandard goods for consumers that do not meet the specified standards and technical conditions are known to everyone. Machine-building factories produce unfit, unfinished machine designs. Light industry enterprises still produce a large number of low-quality goods. These phenomena are harmful to the national economy. These shortcomings in industrial work are unacceptable. The state plan is the law. All enterprises must complete the tasks assigned by the state and ensure that the national economy obtains the products it needs. The leaders of the economic departments and party organizations are responsible for ensuring that each enterprise not only completes the plan in terms of total output but absolutely in terms of producing all items according to the state plan, for striving to improve product quality in a planned manner, and for investigating and completely eliminating the causes that hinder the normal operation of enterprises.

Special attention should be paid to the task of ensuring the continuous and maximum increase in labor productivity in various industrial sectors.

At every stage of socialist construction, our Party has been striving for a planned increase in labor productivity because it is an extremely important condition for improving and enhancing socialist production. This is the main reason why the work of production development in the Soviet Union has made great progress. From 1940 to 1951, labor productivity in industry increased by 50%, and 70% of the increase in industrial output during this period was due to the increase in labor productivity. In the construction industry, labor productivity increased by 36% in the same period.

The rapid increase in labor productivity in the Soviet Union is mainly due to the widespread use of new machinery and the adoption of advanced technological processes in the national economy, the mechanization and electrification of production, especially the mechanization of labor-intensive and heavy work, as well as the improvement of labor organization, the general and cultural education level of the working people, and the improvement of professional skills. The socialist economic system provides unlimited opportunities for the use of the latest improved machinery. In the Soviet Union, machinery not only saves labor but also lightens the work of the workers. Therefore, in the conditions of the socialist economy, workers are very fond of using machinery in the labor process, which is not the case under the capitalist system. Soviet workers are directly interested in increasing labor productivity because they know that this will strengthen the economic power of the Soviet Union and improve the living standards of the working people. The basis of high social labor productivity under the socialist system is the unity of the interests of the state and the people.

However, in our industry, the existing possibilities for increasing labor productivity have not been fully utilized. First of all, this can be seen from the fact that many enterprises have not completed their plans for increasing labor productivity. It should be noted that the government departments have not paid sufficient attention to this important issue; the government departments do not ensure that each enterprise completes its task of increasing labor productivity, but often satisfy themselves with the average results of the entire sector, without taking appropriate measures to bring lagging enterprises to the level of advanced enterprises.

In many enterprises, due to the inability to properly utilize the existing mechanized tools, the increase in labor productivity has been hindered; the fact that the equipment is treated with indifference and allowed to be wasted is unacceptable. In any enterprise, the mechanization of production necessarily frees up part of the workers, who can then be used to expand production in this enterprise or go to work in new enterprises. However, some enterprise leaders do not strive to properly utilize mechanized tools to increase labor productivity but often manage the enterprise in the old way, using a large amount of manual labor.

Another serious shortcoming in the mechanization of production is that in some sectors, the mechanization of the production process is either completely absent or insufficient. In many enterprises where the main production processes are highly mechanized, auxiliary work, including the delivery, transportation, and loading of raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products, is rarely mechanized. All of this reduces the overall economic effect of mechanization and hinders normal production.

Another obstacle to the increase in labor productivity is that in many enterprises and construction sites, labor organization is unsatisfactory, resulting in the waste of a lot of working time. The relevant government departments often determine the number of workers in enterprises or construction sites without sufficient study of actual needs and without investigating whether the labor force is used appropriately. In enterprises, especially in construction sites, the "fluidity" of workers still exists, which is very harmful to production.

In the improvement of labor productivity, technical norms play a significant role. However, in many enterprises, technical norms are unsatisfactorily established. There are still reduced norms, so-called experimental-statistical norms, which do not correspond to the modern level of production technology, do not reflect the experience of advanced workers, and do not stimulate the growth of labor productivity. Such experimental-statistical norms account for a large proportion in many enterprises, exceeding 50% of the existing production norms.

The task of party organizations, economic organizations, and trade union organizations is to quickly eliminate the causes that hinder the increase in labor productivity, ensure that all sectors, enterprises, and production units of the national economy complete and overfulfill the tasks of increasing labor productivity. It is necessary to resolutely eliminate the shortcomings that occur in the utilization of our rich technology, resolutely implement the plans for the complete mechanization and automation of the production process, more widely apply the latest achievements of science and technology in all sectors of the national economy, continuously improve the organizational forms and methods of labor and production, and better utilize the labor force.

Comrades! Our industry is constantly expanding and developing, becoming stronger and more perfect in technology every day. We will continue to develop the productive forces of our socialist industry in various ways, which is the foundation of the strength of our motherland and the basis for improving the material well-being of the Soviet people. (Sustained applause)

B. Agriculture

At the beginning of the period discussed in the report, that is, at the time of the 18th Congress, the collective farm system in our country had already been very consolidated, the collective farms had been strengthened, and the socialist economic system had been established as the sole form of agriculture.

The war temporarily halted the development of agriculture and caused it significant losses, especially in the occupied areas, where the Hitler invaders destroyed and plundered collective farms, agricultural machine stations, and state farms. However, despite the great difficulties of the war, the collective farms and state farms in the eastern regions continuously supplied the army and the people with grain and provided raw materials for light industry without interruption. If it were not for the collective farm system, if it were not for the selfless labor of the collective farm members, their high political consciousness, and high organization, we would not have been able to solve this extremely difficult task.

When turning to peaceful construction, the Party faced the task of restoring and further developing agriculture as quickly as possible. In the post-war period, the Party paid special attention to the organizational and economic consolidation of collective farms, helping them to restore and further develop their public economy and, on this basis, improve the material well-being of the collective farm members. The merger of small collective farms is of great significance for the further development of agricultural productivity because large collective farms can more easily develop and improve their public economy. Currently, there are 97,000 merged large collective farms, while on January 1, 1950, there were 254,000 small collective farms.

Due to the implementation of the measures taken by the Party and the government, the difficulties in agriculture caused by the war and the severe drought of 1946 that followed have been successfully overcome, and in a short period, the pre-war level of agricultural product production has been restored and exceeded.

In the post-war years, the sown area was quickly restored, the harvest increased, and the total output of grain, technical crops, fodder crops, vegetables, melons, and other crops also increased. In 1952, the sown area of various crops exceeded the pre-war level by 5.3 million hectares.

In the third year after the war, grain production was restored to the pre-war level, and in the following years, it increased significantly, while the commercial grain also increased significantly. This year (1952), the total grain harvest reached 8 billion centners, (Stormy applause) and the total harvest of the most important grain crop—wheat—was 48% higher than in 1940. (Applause)

The grain problem, which was previously considered the most acute and serious, has thus been successfully and irrevocably solved. The development of cotton and sugar beet production was particularly rapid in the post-war period: in 1951, the total output of raw cotton exceeded the pre-war level by 46%, and sugar beets by 31%. These extremely important crops have obtained an even more abundant harvest this year. The output of oilseeds, potatoes, and fodder crops has exceeded the pre-war level; moreover, in 1951, the total harvest of juicy fodder (root crops, melon fodder crops, and hay crops) was 25% higher than in 1940. The output of flax, vegetables, and melon crops has significantly increased in the post-war years. However, due to the insufficient attention of the Party, Soviets, and agricultural agencies to the production of these necessary crops, the output of flax and vegetables in many regions has not yet reached the pre-war level.

As in previous years, the state procurement plans for grain, cotton, sugar beets, oilseeds, potatoes, vegetables, and other agricultural products, as well as livestock products, are being successfully fulfilled this year.

Our agricultural skills are becoming more proficient; its output is becoming richer, and the products it produces for the market are increasing. We must understand this extremely important feature of the development of our agriculture. Now that the grain problem has been successfully solved, the achievements in agriculture can no longer be measured only by the level of grain production. From the materials listed above, it can be seen that in addition to the achievements in grain production, we have also made great achievements in the development of the production of cotton, sugar beets, oilseeds, fodder crops, and other crops. Today, our agriculture has changed in quality; it is fundamentally different from the old-style agriculture with low productivity and extensive farming methods. In 1952, the sown area of various crops in the Soviet Union was 1.4 times that of 1913, the sown area of grain increased by 5%, and the sown area of technical crops, vegetables, and melon crops increased to more than 2.4 times, and the sown area of fodder crops increased to more than 11 times. Currently, the value of technical crops accounts for more than 40% of the total value of commercial crops. Therefore, if we only estimate the achievements in agriculture by the level of grain production, it would be a serious mistake.

In the post-war years, we have paid great attention to equipping agriculture with new technology. Otherwise, we would not have been able to solve the task of restoring and further developing agriculture in such a short period. Now, the total number of agricultural machines includes a large number of new, improved diesel-engine tracked tractors, self-propelled combines, hay harvesters, sugar beet combines, flax combines, cotton pickers, and other high-productivity machines. The total horsepower of tractors owned by agricultural machine stations and state farms has increased by 59% compared to the pre-war period, and the total horsepower of combines has increased by 51%.

Agriculture has obtained many new machines that mechanize labor-intensive operations in livestock farming. With the significant improvement in the level of mechanization of agricultural and forestry work in the post-war years, the network of agricultural machine stations has expanded, and many afforestation stations, pasture improvement stations, and livestock machinery stations have been established to mechanize the work of planting protective forest belts, drainage, and pasture improvement, as well as labor-intensive operations in livestock farming. In this period, a total of 1,546 new agricultural machine stations, afforestation stations, pasture improvement stations, and livestock machinery stations have been established, bringing the total number of these types of stations to 8,939.

The achievements in agriculture in the post-war years have created the conditions for completing greater tasks in agriculture. The interests of the national economy and the task of further improving the well-being of the Soviet people require a greater expansion of agricultural product production. In the draft directive on the fifth five-year plan, it is stipulated that in five years, the total harvest will increase as follows: grain by 40 to 50%, including wheat by 55 to 65%, raw cotton by 55 to 65%, flax by 40 to 50%, sugar beets by 65 to 70%, sunflowers by 50 to 60%, potatoes by 40 to 45%, and the production of fodder crops will approximately double or triple.

Now that the pre-war level of sown area has been restored and exceeded, the only correct path to increasing agricultural output is to further increase the yield in every possible way. Increasing the yield is the main task of agriculture. To successfully complete this task, it is necessary to improve the quality of field work, shorten the time of field work, improve the use of tractors and other agricultural machines, complete the mechanization of the main work in agriculture, ensure the rapid implementation of perennial grass rotation in collective farms and state farms, improve the planting of seeds, implement the correct system of cultivation in all places, and increase the area of fertilized and irrigated land. It is necessary to strengthen the organizational role of agricultural machine stations in collective farms, increase the responsibility of agricultural machine stations for the implementation of the plans for the yield and total output of crops and for the development of livestock farming.

Our agriculture must raise productivity and efficiency to a higher level, must have a highly developed grass planting and correct crop rotation system, and must allocate more land for the cultivation of technical crops, fodder crops, vegetables, and potatoes.

Due to the significant achievements in the upsurge of agriculture, the large-scale development of livestock farming has become the central task of the Party and the government in the post-war years in the development of agriculture. From July 1945 to July 1952, the number of cattle in the Soviet Union increased by 13.5 million, sheep by 41.8 million, pigs by 21.2 million, and horses by 5.6 million. In 1948, the number of various cattle reached the pre-war level of 1940, and in 1950, the number of sheep and this year the number of pigs also reached the 1940 level. To ensure a solid foundation for the production of livestock products, the Party has paid special attention to the development of the productive livestock farming of collective farms and state farms. Now, the livestock farming of collective farms and state farms, both in terms of the proportion of livestock and in terms of the production of livestock products, occupies an absolute dominant position in the country. The total and commercial output of meat, dairy, oil, eggs, fur, and leather in the entire Soviet Union has exceeded the pre-war level. (Applause)

To meet the increasing demand of the people for livestock products and to meet the increasing demand of light industry for raw materials, livestock farming must be further significantly developed. In the draft directive on the fifth five-year plan, it is stipulated that in five years, the total number of cattle in the entire agricultural sector will increase by 18 to 20%, and the number of cattle owned by collective farms will increase by 36 to 38%; the total number of sheep will increase by 60 to 62%, and the number of sheep owned by collective farms will increase by 75 to 80%; the total number of pigs will increase by 45 to 50%, and the number of pigs owned by collective farms will increase by 85 to 90%; the total number of horses will increase by 10 to 12%, and the number of horses owned by collective farms will increase by 14 to 16%; the number of poultry owned by collective farms will increase to three to three and a half times. The directive stipulates the increase in the output of livestock products as follows: meat and fat will increase by 80 to 90%, milk will increase by 45 to 50%, fur will increase to two to two and a half times, and eggs (collective farms and state farms) will increase to six to seven times.

The increase in the number of livestock and the simultaneous large-scale increase in their products will remain the main task in the development of livestock farming. To successfully complete this task, it is first necessary to establish a solid fodder base in all collective farms and state farms, ensure good livestock pens, and widely mechanize the work of livestock farming.

Livestock farming must be developed into a productive, large-scale commercial livestock farming with high returns. In the improvement of the breeds of collective farms and state farms, in ensuring the rapid reproduction of existing breeds, and in the creation of new, high-yielding breeds of livestock for agriculture, efforts must continue. Only by correctly combining the increase in the number of livestock with the improvement of breeds and the increase in livestock products can the normal development of livestock farming be possible.

State farms have significantly developed and consolidated in the post-war period; their cultivated area has significantly expanded compared to the pre-war period, and their number of productive livestock, sown area, and agricultural product production have also increased. However, there are still serious shortcomings in the work of state farms. One of the main shortcomings in the work of many state farms is the high cost of grain, meat, dairy products, and other products. State farms must develop many sectors of the economy, improve production organization, implement the complete mechanization of all labor-intensive work, increase the output of agricultural crops and livestock products to ensure further increased supply to the market, and significantly reduce production costs.

The construction of irrigation systems and the planting of protective forest belts are of great significance for the further development of agriculture. Many large irrigation systems equipped with modern technology were built before the war, and old irrigation systems were reconstructed; therefore, the actual area of irrigated land in the Central Asian republics and other regions of the Soviet Union has increased by 1.5 times, making it possible to successfully complete such an important task as significantly increasing cotton production. The work of planting protective forest belts has begun.

The construction of irrigation systems and the planting of protective forest belts have been carried out on a larger scale in the post-war years. Large irrigation systems are being built in the South Caucasus republics, and after the completion of this project, the actual area of irrigated land in this region will increase by 1.5 times in the coming years. The work of irrigating the Central Black Earth Region (Kursk, Oryol, Voronezh, and Tambov regions) with fertile but drought-prone soil to ensure the harvest of grain, technical crops, and other crops has been ongoing since 1947. In the steppes and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union, large state protective forest belts, windbreaks on collective farms and state farms, and the construction of ponds and reservoirs have been carried out on a large scale since 1948. In the past three and a half years, collective farms, state farms, and forestry stations have planted protective forests on 2.6 million hectares of land and built more than 12,000 ponds and reservoirs. In regions with excessive rainfall, primarily in Belarus and the Baltic republics, as before the war, large-scale projects to drain swamps and low-lying areas are being carried out.

Due to the construction of large irrigation systems and hydroelectric power stations on the Volga, Don, Dnieper, and Amu Darya rivers, and the navigation of the Volga-Don Canal named after V. I. Lenin, a broad prospect has opened up for agriculture. The construction of these hydroelectric power stations and irrigation systems will ensure the irrigation of another 6 million hectares of new land, the use of zonal irrigation to bring water to another 22 million hectares of pastures, and the provision of broad possibilities for the electrification of agricultural production, the implementation of electric plowing, electric combines, and other electric agricultural machinery.

In addition to the construction of large-scale irrigation projects, the irrigation systems on all irrigated lands are being successfully reconstructed into new irrigation systems; under this system, the area of irrigated regions will be significantly expanded by improving the distribution of irrigation network branches, reducing the number of permanent irrigation ditches in the fields, and replacing them with temporary irrigation ditches, thus making it possible to more fully utilize the irrigated land and water and create more favorable conditions for the mechanization of agriculture on irrigated land.

The completion of the large-scale work on the development of irrigation, the planting of protective forest belts, and the drainage of swampy areas, as stipulated in the plan, will raise our agriculture to a higher level, and our country will no longer be affected by changes in climate. Our task is to successfully complete the work on the development of irrigation, the planting of protective forest belts, and the drainage of swampy areas within the specified period. The Party, Soviets, and economic organizations must pay special attention to this work.

It is also very important to take measures to increase the output of agricultural crops in the non-black soil regions of the European part of the Soviet Union. Everyone knows that the non-black soil regions have favorable climatic conditions and sufficient rainfall, so there are great possibilities for the successful development of agriculture and livestock farming in these regions.

However, the output of agricultural crops in the non-black soil regions is still low. To ensure a bumper harvest every year, it is necessary to first apply a large amount of lime on acidic soils, apply a sufficient amount of organic and mineral fertilizers, and develop the sowing of grasses and improve cultivation methods in various ways.

In the process of restoring and developing agriculture, our Party, Soviets, and agricultural agencies have improved their leadership of collective farms, agricultural machine stations, and state farms in the post-war years. However, there are still errors and shortcomings in this work.

What are the errors and shortcomings in agricultural leadership? What are the tasks in this regard?

First of all, it must be pointed out that some of our leading cadres, especially in the work of merging smaller collective farms, have adopted incorrect, narrow-minded utilitarian methods to solve the construction of collective farms. They proposed to quickly rebuild the countryside on a large scale to form large collective farm towns, eliminate all old collective farm buildings and peasant houses, and establish large "collective farm towns," "collective farm cities," and "agricultural cities" in new locations, believing that this is the most important task in the organizational and economic strengthening of collective farms. The mistake made by these comrades is that they forgot the main production task facing the collective farms and placed some secondary issues, narrow-minded utilitarian work, and the arrangement of life in collective farms in the first place.

Undoubtedly, the arrangement of comfortable living is important, but it is still a secondary and subordinate issue, not the main issue, and the arrangement of life can only be successfully solved on the basis of the development of public production. If the main production task is forgotten or underestimated, it will lead our entire practical work in the countryside astray, hinder the further development of collective farms, and harm the arrangement of life and all socialist construction work. The Party has taken timely measures to correct this incorrect tendency in the construction of collective farms. The Party, Soviets, and agricultural agencies must continue to pay constant attention to the consolidation and development of the public economy of collective farms—the main force of collective farms—and on this basis, ensure an increase in the production of collective farms for the market and further improve the material and general living conditions of collective farm members.

Secondly, it must be pointed out that many collective farms and state farms have universally established auxiliary enterprises for the production of bricks, tiles, and other industrial products. Experience has shown that this increases the cost of building materials and industrial products, and more importantly, it diverts the strength of collective farms and state farms, making them unable to properly solve the problem of agricultural production and hindering the development of agriculture. This situation must be corrected, and collective farms and state farms must concentrate all their strength on the further development of diversified agricultural production to fully utilize their economic reserves and natural conditions, and increase the output of grain, cotton, sugar beets, flax, potatoes, meat, dairy products, eggs, fur, vegetables, fruits, tea, and other agricultural products as much as possible. As for building materials and other industrial products, our state industry and production cooperatives can and must fully supply all these products to collective farms and state farms at low prices.

Thirdly, it must be admitted that the waste of collective farm property and other violations of the agricultural labor collective regulations still exist. Some officials in the Party, Soviets, and agricultural agencies not only do not protect the interests of the public economy of collective farms but even steal the property of collective farms; they brazenly violate Soviet laws, adopt unreasonable means, and arbitrarily destroy laws when dealing with collective farms. These officials use their positions to occupy public land, force the management committees and chairmen of collective farms to supply them with grain, meat, dairy products, and other items for free or at low prices, exchange their livestock with few products for the livestock of collective farms with many products and more valuable, and so on. All these actions detrimental to collective farms and the state cause serious damage to collective farm members, hinder the further organizational and economic consolidation of collective farms, and undermine the authority of the Party and the Soviet state. It is necessary to resolutely stop the violation of the agricultural labor collective regulations, and those who steal the property of collective farms should be regarded as enemies of the collective farm system and severely punished according to the laws of the socialist state.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 5th.

Next, it must be pointed out that the Party, the Soviets, and the agricultural agencies have handled important issues such as the labor organization of collective farms in an unsatisfactory manner. Everyone knows that in the labor organization of collective farms, certain leaders have taken an incorrect line, using specialized work brigades within the collective farms and abolishing production brigades. This practice is actually against the mechanization of grain cultivation, resulting in the weakening of the collective farms. The work done to eliminate these errors and distortions can greatly improve the labor organization of the collective farms and strengthen the production brigades. However, there are still major shortcomings in this regard. Many collective farms do not have fixed production brigades; production resources are not allocated for the exclusive use of each production brigade, resulting in a lack of responsibility; due to poor management, a large part of the working time is wasted, thus reducing the labor productivity of the collective farm members and failing to complete the production work on time. The Party, Soviets, and agricultural agencies must strive every day to improve the labor organization of the collective farms. Within the collective farms, a more progressive income distribution system should be implemented. According to this system, the income of the collective farms should be distributed to the members according to the number of labor days they work and directly according to the actual quantity of agricultural products produced by the production brigades, work teams, or each collective farm member. This will greatly increase the labor productivity of the collective farm members, completely eliminate the phenomenon of equalizing remuneration, and further increase the value of labor days.

Furthermore, it must be pointed out that the phenomenon of solving many practical problems with stereotyped, formulaic methods in agricultural work has not been eliminated. The leaders of the Party, Soviets, and agricultural agencies often ignore the specific conditions of the locality and issue the same directives to all districts, all collective farms, agricultural machine stations, and state farms regarding agricultural technology, livestock breeding, labor organization, and other agricultural issues. These directives, while correct and necessary for some districts and farms, are often useless and sometimes even harmful to others. Among the staff of the Party, Soviets, and agricultural agencies, there are still many who judge and try to lead agriculture based on so-called average indices. These staff members judge the harvest based on average statistical figures, and the same is true for the productivity of livestock products. Those who are satisfied with average statistical figures do not see the poor conditions of the backward districts, collective farms, and state farms. Therefore, it is impossible to take effective measures in time to provide them with the necessary help. On the other hand, these average indices also do not show the advanced districts, collective farms, and state farms. For them, the tasks assigned based on average indices cannot stimulate them to work better but will only delay and hinder their development.

Finally, we must talk about the main shortcomings in the application of scientific achievements and advanced experience in agriculture. We have many advanced collective farms, agricultural machine stations, and state farms; there are thousands of advanced agricultural production workers who have creatively applied scientific achievements, thereby greatly increasing the harvest and the productivity of livestock products. However, the work of propagating advanced experience and applying it to the production of collective farms and state farms is still unsatisfactory. Our agricultural science has made great contributions to the development of agriculture. The anti-scientific and reactionary ideas in agricultural science have been exposed and defeated, and this science is now developing on the sole correct basis—the basis of the materialist Michurin doctrine—and arming our workers in practical activities to develop agriculture. However, despite the achievements of agricultural science, it still cannot meet the needs of the production of collective farms and state farms. The socialist agricultural system has opened a broad path for science, making it possible to rapidly popularize scientific achievements and advanced experience, enabling all collective farms, agricultural machine stations, and state farms to apply these achievements and experiences. Now, the Party, Soviets, and agricultural agencies have a very important responsibility: to use all means to unleash the initiative and creativity of scientific workers and practical workers, to expand the ranks of farmers who have achieved remarkable results in increasing the harvest and the productivity of livestock products, to support everything that is advanced and progressive, and to apply the scientific achievements and advanced experience in agriculture to the production of collective farms and state farms more quickly.

Comrades! We are all delighted by the tremendous development of our socialist agriculture. Our farming and livestock breeding are now in a new, thriving upsurge. There is no doubt that in the next few years, the well-equipped collective farms, agricultural machine stations, and state farms will achieve even greater successes in developing agriculture, and our country will have abundant grain to supply the people and abundant raw materials to supply the rapidly developing light industry. (Prolonged applause)

Commodity circulation, transportation, and postal services

With the development of our industry and agriculture, commodity circulation has also developed. In the few years since the war, the turnover of state and cooperative trade has increased to 2.9 times, far exceeding the pre-war level. In 1951, state and cooperative stores sold to the people 80% more meat and meat products than in 1940; 60% more fish and fish products; 80% more animal fats; almost double the amount of vegetable oils and other fats; 70% more sugar; 80% more textiles; and 50% more footwear. The state and cooperative retail trade network has expanded, the variety of goods has increased significantly, and the quality has improved.

However, there are still many serious shortcomings in our trade. Trade organizations rarely study the needs of the people; they often make mistakes in the transportation and distribution of goods to the states and republics. In some places, the service to buyers is very inadequate. The current task is to eliminate these shortcomings in the short term and raise Soviet trade to a new, higher level. The draft directive on the fifth five-year plan stipulates that by the end of the plan, the turnover of state and cooperative retail trade should be increased by about 70% compared to 1950.

With the increase in production and commodity circulation, various forms of transportation and cargo transportation have developed. During the Great Patriotic War, our transportation, especially railway transportation, successfully completed the arduous task of ensuring the supply of military needs and essential goods for the national economy. In the years since the war, various forms of transportation have not only recovered but also developed much more than before the war. Compared to 1940, the cargo turnover of railways last year increased by about 80%, river and sea cargo turnover increased by 60%, automobile cargo turnover increased to 3.1 times, and civil aviation cargo turnover increased to 9.2 times. Last year, the average daily loading of railway cars was about 40% higher than in 1940.

Today, all forms of transportation have a more solid technical foundation. Due to the restoration of double-tracking and the laying of new double tracks, the expansion of branch lines, the laying of heavy rails, the expansion of automatic block signaling, and other measures, the carrying capacity of the main railway lines has increased; new railways have been built and put into operation; the work of electrifying the railways with the most frequent cargo transportation is still continuing; locomotives and cars have increased significantly—more powerful locomotives and cars with larger capacities have increased significantly.

In water transportation, the length of inland waterways in 1951 increased by 23,000 kilometers compared to 1940. Sea and river transportation have expanded with the increase in cargo and passenger ships. Since 1940, the mechanization of loading and unloading work has increased significantly; in 1951, it increased by 83% in the river transportation department and by 90% in the maritime transportation department.

Automobile transportation has been equipped with new, more advanced trucks and buses. Compared to 1940, the network of improved roads has expanded to 3.1 times. In the few years since the war, communication tools such as postal services, telegraphs, telephones, and radio have further developed. The national telephone and telegraph systems have expanded, and the call capacity of urban telephones has improved. Now, all central cities of districts are connected by telephone and telegraph with the central cities of states; the work of installing telephones in village Soviets and agricultural machine stations has also been basically completed. The radio listening network is now almost twice that of 1940. Postal services have greatly expanded; the length of postal air routes has increased to 2.5 times.

Along with the achievements, there are also serious shortcomings in transportation and postal services. Many railway enterprises, shipping companies, and automobile companies have not completed the loading and cargo transportation plans assigned to them. There is still a lot of idle time in the loading and unloading of railway cars and ships. The phenomenon of unreasonable, long-distance railway cargo transportation has not been eliminated. Automobile transportation work is still poorly organized, with a lot of idle time in the scheduling of loaded trucks, and many vehicles run empty.

In the shortcomings of the postal service, it should be noted that the postal service for the needs of the national economy and residents is still not accurate enough.

It is necessary to further develop and improve various forms of transportation and postal services, to cherish transportation equipment and to pay constant attention to its maintenance and protection, to develop and strengthen the technical equipment of various types of transportation, and to use all means to improve postal, telegraph, and telephone services.

Economic austerity is an extremely important means of further improving the national economy

The Soviet Union relies on its own resources and the sources of internal capital accumulation to develop the national economy. Therefore, our Party has always paid great attention to the strictest economy, regarding thrift as an extremely important condition for creating capital accumulation in the national economy and correctly utilizing accumulated capital. As a method of socialist management, thrift has played an important role in the industrialization of the state. Since our national economy is now experiencing another rapid upsurge, and the prices of daily necessities are falling, thrift has become even more important. The more fully and rationally production resources are utilized, the more carefully we manage our economy, the greater the victories we will achieve in the development of various sectors of the national economy, and the greater the achievements we will achieve in improving the material and cultural level of the people.

However, there are serious shortcomings in the exploitation and correct utilization of the internal resources of the national economy.

First, it must be pointed out that there are huge losses and non-productive expenditures in enterprises. In many industrial sectors, production capacity is still not used appropriately. Many departments of the government consider the "difficulties" in production when determining the capacity of enterprises. When calculating production capacity, they often use reduced equipment productivity standards; when determining the labor quota required for the production of goods, they do not consider the advanced technology and improved labor organization methods. These departments do not use the internal resources of enterprises more effectively to increase production but often request the government to invest in the establishment of new enterprises. Many enterprises suffer huge losses due to poor management and waste of materials, raw materials, fuel, electricity, tools, and other valuable resources; in addition, the established expenditure standards are often violated; very perfect substitutes are not vigorously promoted; there is a lot of waste in production. For example, in 1951, the total losses and non-productive expenditures in enterprises of national significance amounted to 4.9 billion rubles, of which 3 billion rubles were due to waste.

Due to the improper use of production capacity and poor management, many industrial enterprises have not completed their tasks in reducing production costs, allowing waste. There are also huge shortcomings in the drafting of production cost plans. Certain economic responsible persons, considering narrow departmental interests, harming state interests, use methods such as increasing material consumption quotas and arbitrarily increasing the labor quota indicators for the production of various goods to retain "reserve forces" in the production cost reduction plans. The practice of drafting production cost plans that harm state interests in some enterprises shows that the relevant departments of the government have not exercised the necessary supervision over this issue. The relevant departments of the government do not conduct a thorough study of the production conditions of each enterprise, do not take necessary measures to ensure the gradual reduction of production costs, and allow production cost plans to be drafted without review and approval.

Second, it should be pointed out that thrift is particularly poorly implemented in the construction industry. Our construction industry is still very costly. Construction workers are far less effective in reducing production costs than industrial workers. There are many major shortcomings in the organization of the construction industry, the use of mechanized tools is inappropriate, labor productivity is low, materials are used unreasonably, and overhead costs are very high. A major shortcoming in basic construction is that manpower and resources are dispersed among many construction organizations, including many small construction organizations that cannot effectively use mechanized tools. All these factors increase construction costs, make the administrative management apparatus cumbersome, and increase overhead costs; for example, in 1951, the overhead costs in the construction industry exceeded the budget by more than 1 billion rubles, and the construction industry not only did not achieve the planned profit of 2.9 billion rubles but also incurred a loss of 2.5 billion rubles.

Third, there are huge losses and non-productive expenditures in agriculture. Currently, the scale of agricultural machinery equipment is much larger than before the war. However, there are still major shortcomings in the use of tractors and agricultural machinery. Many agricultural machine stations and state farms are not satisfactory in the maintenance of machinery and tractors, resulting in machinery being worn out before its time, and the expenditure on machinery repairs is very large; the consumption of fuel and lubricating oil is also very high. All these factors increase the cost of tractor work.

In many agricultural machine stations, collective farms, and state farms, the situation of poor management has not been eliminated; work is poorly organized, resulting in the failure to achieve the planned standards of harvest and causing huge losses to the harvest; the management of collective farm property is unsatisfactory; due to poor livestock breeding, many collective farms have a high mortality rate of livestock, and the productivity of livestock products is very low.

In transportation, there are also huge losses and non-productive expenditures. On many railways, in many shipping companies and automobile enterprises, due to the failure to complete the loading plans, the idle time of cars, ships, and loaded trucks is very long, the additional consumption of fuel, and the many losses caused by poor management, the amount of overspending and losses is considerable. The phenomenon of treating locomotives, cars, ships, and loaded trucks carelessly, causing huge losses to the state, is still common.

Again, the expenditure on the procurement, storage, and sale of agricultural products is very high; the business expenses of trade organizations are also very high. The staff of procurement, trade, and sales organizations are too many. In the central and local areas, many procurement and sales organizations often procure and sell the same products and raw materials. The shortcomings in the procurement and sales plans have led to unreasonable, long-distance transportation. In the procurement, storage, and sale of agricultural products, the phenomenon of high overhead costs is due to the fact that the relevant departments of the government have not paid sufficient attention to the reduction of overhead costs and have not controlled the cost of the procured agricultural products. Due to the lack of control over costs by the relevant departments of the government, various evils have arisen, allowing procurement organizations to cover up their poor management by including all losses and waste in the procurement costs. The organizational work of procurement, supply, and sales is lacking in proper order, and the lack of strict economy has caused the state to suffer tens of billions of rubles in losses.

Finally, the amount of administrative management expenses is still very high. The number of staff in many state management agencies has been repeatedly reduced in recent years. But this is mainly done under the orders of superiors according to administrative procedures, and the problem of reducing the expenses of administrative management agencies has not become a constant concern of the leaders of various agencies and organizations. Many departments and bureaus employ more than the quota of personnel. The agencies and organizations of states, cities, and districts also have a large number of excess personnel.

Experience has shown that through the improvement of the work of administrative management agencies and the improvement of the organizational work of procurement and sales, a part of the workforce has been freed up, and more will be freed up in the future. Economic agencies and party organizations are responsible for appropriately using this freed-up workforce to serve the development of the national economy. The relevant departments of the government, the labor reserve department, party organizations, and trade unions must pay attention to ensuring that these cadres obtain the necessary production technology, so that they can go to the economic sectors that need to increase personnel to exert their abilities.

The situation of waste of materials, money, and manpower in various sectors of the national economy shows that many responsible persons have forgotten the need for thrift, they do not care about the rational and economical use of state funds, they have not paid due attention to the improvement of financial and economic work in the enterprises and agencies they are responsible for, party organizations have not paid attention to these shortcomings, and have not corrected the mistakes of these responsible persons.

The current task is to stop the indifference of economic responsible persons and party organizations to poor management and waste. The issue of thrift should always be the central link in all our economic work and party work. We should always pay attention to educating the Soviet people with the spirit of cherishing public, socialist property. We must eliminate all phenomena of waste of resources, manpower, and funds, and ensure the planned completion and overfulfillment of the task of reducing product costs. We must intensify the fight against poor management; drastically reduce the overhead costs in industry, construction, transportation, agriculture, and trade, procurement, and sales organizations; take decisive steps to simplify the structure of state agencies and economic agencies and reduce their administrative expenses; the financial departments should strengthen the control over the completion of economic plans and thrift through the ruble. Our economic workers must master the socialist management methods perfectly, improve their technical and economic knowledge, improve production methods in a planned manner, find, exploit, and utilize the potential of the national economy. Promoting the socialist competition movement is very important for the smooth completion of the task of developing the national economy. The Party has always paid great attention to organizing this competition and believes that the main purpose of socialist competition is to enable backward workers to reach the level of the best workers in their work and to catch up with the best workers. In our society, the example of active labor plays a very important role in the various sectors of socialist construction. The Soviet people feel every day from their own experience that with the best examples of production organization, the adoption of new technologies and various innovations and inventions, labor will be lightened, and the material living standards of laboring people will be improved. In all sectors of socialist construction, we have countless examples that can be used to illustrate how workers have exerted their initiative and creativity to ensure the continuous development and improvement of socialist production. Our people have long been famous for their initiative, wit, and inventive genius.

The enemies of socialism and their various echoers have called socialism an institution that suppresses individuality. There is nothing more naive and vulgar than this statement. The facts have proved that the socialist system can guarantee the freedom of individuality, the development of individual and collective creativity, and create favorable conditions for the development of talents and genius hidden deep within the people.

In our country, honest work is highly respected and promptly encouraged. The Party and the government are widely implementing the system of awarding bonuses and medals to laborers who have achieved success in the national economy and culture. Since the end of the Patriotic War, the Soviet Union has awarded medals and badges to 1,346,000 workers, collective farm members, scientists, engineers, technicians, clerks, doctors, teachers, and other workers. To commend the outstanding innovative activities of 6,480 laborers in our country, the state has awarded them the high title of Hero of Socialist Labor.

The task of the Party, Soviets, economic departments, and trade unions and the Communist Youth League is to further expand the competition movement in all sectors of socialist construction, vigorously encourage the advanced examples and progressive innovations in work, and use various methods to popularize advanced experience among all laboring people to help backward workers reach the level of advanced workers. In the struggle between the new and the old, the advanced and the backward, it is important not only to see the forces that create a new social system but also to constantly develop these forces, to care about how to develop them in various ways, and to organize them tirelessly and unremittingly for smooth progress and perfection.

Improving the material well-being, health, and cultural level of the people

The achievements of various sectors of the national economy have further improved the material and cultural living standards of Soviet society. This is a very logical result, and there can be no other result, because in our country, the development of socialist production is for the maximum satisfaction of the ever-increasing material and cultural needs of society.

The main indicator of the improvement of the living standards of the Soviet people is the continuous increase of national income. From 1940 to 1951, the national income of the Soviet Union increased by 83%. Unlike capitalist countries, where a large part of the national income is seized by the exploiting class, in the Soviet Union, all national income is the property of the laboring people. About three-quarters of the national income is used to meet the material and cultural needs of the Soviet laboring people, and the rest is used to expand socialist production and meet other national and social needs.

The most important source of the increase in the actual wages of workers and employees and the actual income of peasants is the consistent policy of the government to reduce the prices of daily necessities. As a result of the five reductions in state retail prices from 1947 to 1952, the current prices of food and industrial goods are on average half of what they were in the fourth quarter of 1947.

Everyone knows that workers and employees in our country can receive various social insurance allowances from the state, receive pensions from the social maintenance fund, enter sanatoriums, rest homes, and children's care institutions for free or at a reduced rate, and have paid vacations every year. All urban and rural laborers receive free medical treatment. The state provides allowances to mothers with many children and single mothers in cities and villages; the state guarantees free education in primary and seven-year schools; students receive scholarships. The total value of the above subsidies and allowances received by urban and rural laborers in 1940 was 40.8 billion rubles, and in 1951, it was 125 billion rubles.

Due to the increase in the monetary wages of workers and employees and the increase in the cash and in-kind income of peasants, due to the reduction in the prices of daily necessities and the increase in other subsidies provided by the state to the people, the actual income of workers and employees in 1951 was on average about 57% higher per person than in 1940, and the actual income of peasants was on average about 60% higher per person.

The draft directive on the fifth five-year plan stipulates that in the five-year period, the national income of the Soviet Union should be increased by at least 60%, the actual wages of workers and employees should be increased by at least 35% (including the reduction of retail prices), and the cash and in-kind income of collective farm members (calculated in cash) should be increased by at least 40%.

Housing construction and municipal construction are being carried out on a large scale in our country. In just a few years since the war, 155 million square meters of new housing have been built in cities and workers' residential areas, and 3.8 million houses have been built in agricultural areas. The scale of housing construction is particularly large in the areas that were occupied during the war. However, despite the large-scale housing construction, there is still a significant shortage of housing in our country. The relevant departments of the government and local Soviets have not been able to implement the housing construction plans assigned to them year after year, failing to fully utilize the funds allocated by the state for this purpose. In just the past two years, due to the failure to complete the housing construction plan, the construction of 4 million square meters of residential housing has been delayed. Many economic and party leaders do not consider the housing needs of laborers as a priority and have not taken steps to implement the plans for housing construction and repair.

The current task is to strive to expand housing construction. The draft directive on the fifth five-year plan stipulates that the basic construction fund for state housing will be increased to about twice that of the fourth five-year plan.

The Party and the government have always shown and continue to show great concern for the health of our people. The state's health expenditure, including the funds used for this purpose from the social insurance fund, has increased from 11.2 billion rubles in 1940 to 26.4 billion rubles in 1951. On this basis, public medical and health services have been further improved and expanded. In 1951, the number of hospital beds in cities and villages increased by 30% compared to 1940. The network of sanatoriums has expanded. The number of doctors in the country has increased by 80%.

Due to the improvement of the material and cultural level of the people and the improvement of public medical services, the mortality rate in our country has decreased. In the past three years, the population has increased by 9.5 million. (Prolonged applause)

Education expenditure has increased from 22.5 billion rubles in 1940 to 57.3 billion rubles in 1951, that is, it has more than doubled. Just in the few years since the war, 23,500 schools have been built. Now, the number of students in the Soviet Union is 57 million, almost 8 million more than in 1940. Seven-year and ten-year schools have been greatly expanded; from 1940 to 1951, the number of students in grades five to ten increased by 25%. The number of students in secondary technical schools and other secondary specialized schools increased by 40% during this period, while the number of students in higher education increased by 67%. Just in 1952, 221,000 young specialists graduated from higher education to work in various sectors of the national economy, and this year, 375,000 new students were enrolled. Now, the Soviet Union has about 5.5 million specialists who have graduated from higher education or secondary specialized schools, which is about 2.2 times that of the pre-war period.

Given the increasing importance of science in our social life, the Party has always been concerned with its development. The Soviet state has begun to build and equip a vast network of scientific research institutions and has created the most favorable conditions for the development of science; the Soviet state has ensured the large-scale training of scientific personnel. In the Soviet Union, the number of scientific research institutions, laboratories, and other scientific institutions increased from 1,560 in 1939 to 2,900 by the beginning of 1952. The number of scientific personnel has almost doubled during this period. From 1946 to 1951, the state spent 47.2 billion rubles on the development of science.

In the past few years, the network of cultural and educational institutions in cities and villages has been greatly expanded. Now, the country has 368,000 libraries of various types. Since 1939, the number of libraries has increased by more than 120,000. The number of books published annually has reached 800 million, an increase of 1.8 times compared to 1940. From 1939 to the present, the number of sound film equipment in cities and villages has almost tripled.

An extremely important and indispensable part of Soviet culture is literature and art. We have achieved great success in the development of Soviet literature, fine arts, theater, and film. A significant proof of this is that every year many talented workers in this field receive the Stalin Prize. A total of 2,339 literary and artistic workers have been awarded the honorable title of Stalin Prize winner.

The achievements are great, but if we do not see the major shortcomings in the development of our literature and art because of these achievements, that would be wrong. The problem is that although great achievements have been made in the development of literature and art, many works still have insufficient ideological and artistic levels. Our literature and art still produce many mediocre, dull, gray works, sometimes even crude and shoddy works that distort Soviet reality. In the works of some writers and artists, the vibrant and multifaceted life of Soviet society is depicted as lifeless and dull. In such an important and popular form of art as film, shortcomings still exist. Our film workers can produce films of high educational value, but the number of such films is still small. Our film industry has the ability to produce many different types of good films, but this ability has not been well utilized.

It must be considered that the ideological and cultural level of Soviet people has been greatly improved; the Party is cultivating their aesthetic appreciation with the best literature and art works.

Soviet people cannot tolerate dull, unthinking, and unrealistic works; they demand high standards from the creative work of our writers and artists. Our writers and artists must mercilessly criticize the errors, shortcomings, and unhealthy phenomena encountered in society in their works; they must create positive artistic images, portray the brilliant personality of new-type people, and help cultivate qualities, habits, and customs free from the poisons and vices produced by capitalism in our society's people. However, in our Soviet novels and plays, as well as in films, works such as satire are still lacking today. If it is believed that there is no material for satire in our Soviet reality, that is incorrect. We need Soviet Gogols and Saltykov-Shchedrins whose satire, like fire, burns all the negative, decaying, and dying things in life, all the things that hinder progress.

Our Soviet literature and art must boldly portray the contradictions and conflicts of life, must be good at using criticism as a weapon, and regard it as an effective educational tool. The power and significance of realistic art lie in the fact that it can and must excavate and portray the noble spiritual qualities of ordinary people and typical, positive characteristics, creating bright artistic images of ordinary people that are worthy of being models and examples for others.

In creating artistic images, our artists, writers, and art workers must always remember that typicality is not only the most common thing but also the thing that most fully and sharply expresses the essence of certain social forces. According to the Marxist-Leninist understanding, typicality is not some statistical average. Typicality is consistent with the essence of a certain social-historical phenomenon; it is not just the most common, frequently occurring, and ordinary phenomenon. Conscious exaggeration and prominent depiction of an image do not exclude typicality but rather more fully excavate and emphasize it. Typicality is the basic category of party spirit in realistic art. The issue of typicality is often a political issue.

Only when we have waged a resolute struggle against the crude works of our artists and writers, only when we have ruthlessly eliminated the falsity and decay in literary and artistic works, can the noble task facing literary and artistic workers be smoothly solved. In the great struggle to cultivate new, brilliant things in social life and eliminate old, dying things, our literary and artistic workers bear a great responsibility. The responsibility of our writers, artists, composers, and film workers is to delve deeper into the life of Soviet society, creating artistic masterpieces worthy of our great people. (Applause)

Comrades, we have achieved great success in improving the material well-being and cultural level of the Soviet people. However, we cannot be satisfied with the current achievements. Our task is to ensure the continuous improvement of the material and cultural level of the Soviet people on the basis of the overall development of the national economy. Our Party will continue to show unremitting concern for how to maximize the satisfaction of the ever-increasing needs of the Soviet people, because the happiness and prosperity of the Soviet people are the highest criterion of our Party. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

Further consolidation of the Soviet social and state system

In the period since the Eighteenth Party Congress, our Soviet state has continued to develop and grow stronger.

The economic foundation of our state—the socialist ownership of the means of production—has developed and consolidated. During this period, the friendly cooperation between the workers, peasants, and intellectuals who make up Soviet socialist society has been further strengthened.

In the face of the greatest difficulties, our social and state system has proven to be the strongest, most vital, and most stable in the world, and the experience of war has proven this. The reason why the Soviet socialist system has such indestructible power is that it is a truly people's system established by the people themselves, which enjoys the strong support of the people and guarantees the full development of all material and spiritual forces of the people.

The enemies of Marxism and those who vulgarize Marxism have advocated a theory that is extremely harmful to our cause, claiming that the Soviet state will decline under the conditions of capitalist encirclement. The Party has defeated and refuted this rotten theory, proposing and proving a conclusion that in the case where the socialist revolution has already won in one country and capitalism still rules in most other countries, the country that has won the revolution must not weaken its state but must strengthen it with all its might; that even under the communist system, the state must be preserved if capitalist encirclement still exists. If we had allowed our state to weaken in the past, we would not have been able to achieve the achievements we are proud of today in peaceful construction. If we had not strengthened our state, our army, our punitive and investigative organs in the past, we would have found ourselves empty-handed in front of the enemy and faced the danger of military defeat. The Party has made the Soviet state an unbreakable socialist fortress because it has always, in the past and now, continued to strengthen the socialist state with all its might. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

When the fascist invaders attacked our country, they expected internal instability in the Soviet society and state system and the weakness of the Soviet rear. However, everyone knows that the war has overturned their plans. Comrade Stalin said: Once war breaks out, our front and rear, due to their unity and internal cohesion, will be stronger than the front and rear of any other country. His historic judgment has been completely proven. In the war, the armed forces and rear of the Soviet power became stronger. The selfless labor of the Soviet people in the rear and the heroic struggle of the Soviet Army and Navy on the front will be forever inscribed in history as an unprecedented feat of the people defending their homeland. Our army and navy were built up, strengthened, and fought under the direct leadership of Comrade Stalin. (Stormy, prolonged applause) The brilliant military leader, the organizer of the historic victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War, Comrade Stalin created advanced Soviet military science and armed our army with the art of defeating the enemy. Our people love their army and navy, care for them constantly, and pay attention to them. The armed forces of the Soviet Union have been, are, and will be a reliable shield for the security of our motherland. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

The great Patriotic War and the years of peaceful development after the war have once again shown that the Soviet social system established under the leadership of the Party is the best form of social organization; the Soviet state system is an example of a multi-ethnic state. Many of our enemies and malicious people in the bourgeois camp have been chattering endlessly, claiming that the multi-ethnic Soviet state is an unstable state, placing their hopes on the division of the Soviet peoples, and predicting the inevitable collapse of the Soviet Union.

They measure our state by the standards of their bourgeois states because there are national contradictions and conflicts in their states. The enemies of socialism cannot understand that as a result of the great October Revolution and socialist transformation, the peoples of our country have been united on the basis of complete equality with a strong friendship. (Applause) Our Party, adhering to the Lenin-Stalin national policy, has consolidated the multi-ethnic Soviet state, developed friendship and mutual cooperation among the peoples of the Soviet Union, supported, guaranteed, and encouraged the cultural progress of all the peoples of our country in all aspects, and waged an uncompromising struggle against all kinds of nationalists. The Soviet state system, which has withstood the severe test of war and has become a true example and model of national equality and cooperation in the world, demonstrates the great victory of the Lenin-Stalin theory on the national question. (Prolonged applause)

Our Party will now and in the future protect the unity and friendship of the peoples of the Soviet Union like the apple of its eye, just as it has consolidated and will continue to consolidate the multi-ethnic Soviet state in the past. (Stormy applause)

During the period covered in the report, new nations have joined the Soviet family. The Lithuanian, Moldavian, Latvian, and Estonian Soviet Socialist Republics have been established in succession. The entire Ukrainian nation has been united in a single state. Belarus has united the entire Belarusian nation into one family. In the northwest, we now have more just and more defensible new borders. In the Far East, the Soviet Union has recovered the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands, which were previously separated from Russia. Now, the borders of the Soviet Union are more in line with the historical development of the peoples of our country than ever before.

With the help of the peoples of many brother republics, some new union republics have made great progress in industrialization in a short period of time, transformed small-scale farming onto the socialist path, completed the collectivization work, and are successfully developing socialist agriculture.

In the post-war period, the basic functions of our state—economic and cultural-educational functions—have developed and been further strengthened. The rapid progress of socialist construction and the task of deepening the leadership of the Party and Soviets into districts, towns, and villages require many reforms in the administrative divisions of our country, the establishment of new states, districts, and districts. The growth of the national economy requires further changes in the organizational forms of state management of various departments of industry, agriculture, and other aspects of the national economy. This is reflected in the tightening of the staffing of central state management agencies and the establishment of new agencies.

Of the greatest significance for the consolidation of our state is the consistent implementation of the principles of socialist democracy, which are the basis of the Stalin Constitution. In the post-war period, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Supreme Soviets of the Union and Autonomous Republics, and the local Soviets of Workers' Deputies have undergone two elections.

These elections were held in a great political upsurge, and they once again demonstrated the unity of our people and the boundless trust of our people in the Communist Party and the Soviet government. (Stormy applause)

The tasks of the Party in domestic policy are:

(1) To continue to firmly strengthen the economic power of our state, to organize and lead the peaceful labor of the Soviet people to complete and overfulfill the major tasks stipulated in the fifth five-year plan of the Soviet Union as an important stage in the transition from socialism to communism;

(2) To promote the further development of industry and transportation. To more widely use the latest achievements in science and technology in industry, construction, and transportation, to use all means to improve labor productivity, strengthen discipline to complete state plans, and ensure the high quality of products. To continuously reduce production costs, because this is the basis for continuously reducing the wholesale and retail prices of all goods;

(3) To further develop agriculture so that our country can produce abundant grain for the people in the shortest time and abundant raw materials for light industry. To ensure the absolute completion of the main tasks in agriculture—to strive to increase the yield of all crops, increase the number of livestock, and at the same time improve their productivity, increase the total and commercial output of agricultural and livestock products. To improve the work of agricultural machine stations and state farms. To improve the labor productivity of collective farms, to further strengthen the public economy of collective farm members, to increase their wealth, and on this basis, to ensure the further improvement of the material well-being of collective farm members;

(4) To implement strict economy in all sectors of the national economy and all kinds of management agencies;

(5) To further develop advanced Soviet science to make it the first in the world. (Applause) To concentrate the efforts of scientists to solve scientific problems related to the utilization of the extremely rich natural resources of our country more quickly. To strengthen the creative cooperation between science and production, because this can enrich science with practical experience and at the same time help practical workers to solve the problems they encounter more quickly;

(6) To strive to develop the creativity of the working people of our motherland, to further expand the socialist competition movement, to be unremitting in caring for the emergence of more and more active model examples of new ways of organizing labor in all sectors of socialist construction, and to constantly popularize these model examples of work among all laboring people, so that the model examples of advanced workers in our society are emulated by more and more people working on the labor front;

(7) To further improve the material well-being of our people; to continuously increase the actual wages of workers and employees, to improve the living conditions of laboring people; to use all means to help increase the income of peasants. To develop Soviet culture; to improve people's education and health work; to constantly pay attention to the further development of Soviet literature and art;

(8) To strengthen our social and state system to the greatest extent. To further develop the political activism and patriotism of the Soviet people, to strengthen the spiritual and political unity and friendship of the peoples of our country;

(9) To be vigilant against the machinations of warmongers. To use all means to strengthen the Soviet Army, Navy, and intelligence agencies. (Stormy applause)

    苏联共产党（布）中央委员会的报告
    ——苏联共产党（布）中央委员会书记马林科夫在苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会上所作
                    （续昨）
    （二）苏联的内部情况
    报告所谈时期的特点是：苏联内部状况的进一步稳固，整个国民经济和社会主义文化的发展。第十八次党代表大会闭幕后的最初两年中，我国劳动人民继续顺利地执行第三个五年计划，使苏联得到了进一步的巩固。在这些年份中，在国民经济的发展方面获得了新的成就。
    苏联人民的和平劳动因法西斯德国对苏联发动的背信弃义的进攻而中断了。苏维埃国家的历史上开始了一个艰难的时期——伟大卫国战争时期。在这个战争的过程中，工人阶级、集体农民和苏维埃知识分子在前线和后方都表现了高度的自觉性和对祖国的忠诚。
    苏联以历史性的胜利结束了这次战争以后，便进入新的、经济发展的和平时期。苏维埃国家依靠它自己的人力物力，没有外力的援助，在短期内就恢复了被战争破坏的经济，使它向前发展，越过了战前的经济指标。
    由于工业和农业的恢复有了进展，我们在一九四七年就能够废除食品和工业品的配给制，实行币制改革。这些措施以及食品和工业品的五次减价，提高了苏联卢布的购买力，保证了劳动人民物质福利的增加。一九五○年，卢布改为金本位制，它的外汇率提高了。
    在恢复和发展经济方面获得的成就，使苏维埃国家有可能着手实现新的重大的国民经济任务，其中包括在伏尔加河和第聂伯河上建筑强大的水电站，开凿巨大的通航运河和灌溉渠，在我国广大地区植造防护林带。
    在报告所谈时期内发生的历史事件，表明了苏维埃社会制度和国家制度不仅是我们国家在和平建设的年代中使经济提高和文化提高的最好组织形式，而且是在战时动员人民一切力量去打退敌人的最好组织形式。这些事件也表明了劳动人民的政治积极性已大大提高，团结在共产党周围的苏联人民的精神上和政治上的团结已进一步巩固，苏联各族人民的兄弟合作已进一步加强，苏维埃爱国主义已进一步发展。
    我国人民决心继续奋不顾身地为社会主义祖国的幸福而劳动，光荣地完成建设共产主义社会的历史任务。（暴风雨般的经久不息的鼓掌）
    一、苏联国民经济的进一步高涨
    甲、工业
    在战前几个五年计划的年代中，苏联实现了社会主义工业化。强大的工业是发展整个国民经济和准备积极国防的基础。战争的年代特别有力地证明了我们党的国家工业化的总方针是正确的。苏联工业化政策的实现，对苏联人民的命运具有决定性的意义，并且拯救我们的祖国免受奴役。
    在战争的困难环境中，党能够很快地把工业转移到战时轨道上。一切最重要的工业企业的设备，都由战区移到东部地区。在战争年代中，苏维埃国家在自己身上找到了足够的力量和资源，不仅足以使迁移的企业迅速开工，而且足以加紧建立新的企业，主要是重工业工厂。虽然法西斯侵略者暂时占领了我国经济上重要的地区，但是我国的工业在战争期间为前线制造了各种军备和弹药，数量还一年比一年加多。
    随着战争的结束，工业又由军事生产改为民用生产。党提出了首先大规模发展重工业——特别是冶金、燃料和电力工业——的任务，因为没有重工业，要解决恢复及进一步发展国民经济的任务是不可能的。同时，党特别注意扩大日常消费品生产，以提高人民的生活水平。
    要把国民经济恢复到战前水平是需要相当时间的。工业年产量是在一九四八年达到并超过战前一九四○年的水平，煤的采掘量是在一九四七年，钢和水泥的生产是在一九四八年，铣铁的生产和石油的开采是在一九四九年，鞋类的生产是在一九五○年，棉织品的生产是在一九五一年。这就是说，战争使我们的工业发展耽搁了八九年——大约两个五年计划的时期。
    由于工业在战后几年中的顺利恢复和发展，现在的工业生产水平大大超过了战前时期。下面是这方面的数字：
    苏联工业产品增长情形
                （以一九四○年为一百）
                                  其中
           工业总产量  生产资料产量  消费品产量一九四○年　一○○　   一○○　      一○○一九四四年　一○四　   一三六　      五四一九四五年　九二　     一一二　      五九一九四六年　七七　     八二　        六七一九四七年　九三　     一○一　      八二一九四八年　一一八　   一三○　      九九一九四九年　一四一　   一六三　      一○七一九五○年　一七三　   二○五　      一二三一九五一年　二○二　   二三九　      一四三一九五二年  二二三　   二六七　      一五六（计划中）（规定的）（数字）
    由这些数字中可以看出，在一九四五年和一九四六年，工业生产水平曾经下降。这是由于军事技术的生产在战后大大缩小了，而工业转移到和平的轨道上还需要有相当的时间。战后工业生产的调整基本上是在一九四六年完成的，此后我国工业的产量就开始迅速上升，一九五一年工业总产量为一九四○年产量的两倍多。一九五二年在我国工业的发展方面又取得了新的进展。
    大家知道，今年关于工业的整个计划不仅顺利地完成着而且正在超额完成，因此，我们有充分理由相信：一九五二年的工业产量大约将为一九四零年产量的二点三倍。制造生产资料的工业有了特别迅速的发展；它的一九五一年的总产量为战前水平的二点四倍，一九五二年的总产量大约将为战前水平的二点七倍。一九五二年的产量将如下：铣铁二千五百万吨，约比一九四零年增加百分之七十；钢三千五百万吨，约比一九四零年增加百分之九十；压延金属二千七百万吨，为一九四零年产量的两倍多；煤三亿吨，比一九四零年增加百分之八十多；石油四千七百万吨，比一九四零年增加百分之五十多；电力一千一百七十亿瓩时，为一九四零年的二点四倍；机器和设备将为一九四零年产量的三倍多。
    至于最重要的工业部门的产量每年的增加率，近年来也比战前时期快得多。例如，在一九四九年到一九五一年这最近三年（这个时期不但恢复了而且超过了战前的工业生产水平）中，铣铁产量增加了八百万吨，钢一千三百万吨，压延金属一千万吨；而在战前，要增加这样大的产量，铣铁需要八年，钢需要九年，压延金属需要十二年。煤的采掘量在这三年中增加了七千四百万吨，石油一千三百万吨；而在战前，要增加这样大的产量，煤需要六年，石油需要十年。电力产量在这三年中增加了三百七十亿瓩时；而在战前，电力产量增加这么大，需要九年的时间。
    生产资料生产量的增加和农业产量的发展已为消费品工业的发展提供了可靠的基础。这种工业一九五一年的总产量比一九四零年增加了百分之四十三，一九五二年的产量大约将比一九四零年增加百分之六十。一九五二年产量的数字将如下：棉织品将在五十亿公尺以上，比一九四零年约多百分之三十；毛织品将近一亿九千万公尺，比一九四零年约多百分之六十；丝织品两亿一千八百万公尺，为一九四零年产量的二点八倍；皮鞋两亿五千万双，比一九四零年约多百分之二十；胶鞋一亿二千五百万双，比一九四零年多百分之八十；糖三百三十多万吨，比一九四零年多百分之五十以上；工业加工的动物油三十八万多吨（尚有大量家制的油未算计在内），这将比战前工业生产动物油的产量多百分之七十以上。
    由于战后时期工业的顺利恢复和发展，苏联工业按人口平均计算的出产额现在已超过战前水平。例如，一九五一年电力的产量按人口计算每人平均所得比一九四零年多至二倍以上，铣铁多百分之五十，钢多百分之七十，煤多百分之六十，水泥多至二倍以上，棉织品多百分之二十，毛织品多百分之六十以上，纸张多百分之七十，等等。
    在报告所谈的时期中，特别是在战后年代，由于建造了新的工厂和改建了现有的工厂，我国工业的生产技术基础得到很大的扩大和巩固。就在一九四六—一九五一年，在投入国民经济中的约五千亿卢布的全部投资中，有三千二百亿卢布以上是工业投资。在这个时期中，恢复和新建起来并开了工的巨大的国家工业企业约有七千个。与一九四零年相比，工业的固定生产资财到一九五二年已提高了百分之七十七。
    但是，问题并不仅仅在于固定生产资财在量的方面提高了。过去这一个时期还有另一个特点，就是工业技术的不断进步。在资本主义国家中，技术发展有周期性的中断，伴随这种中断的现象是，社会生产力因经济危机而遭到破坏；与资本主义国家的情况恰成对照，苏联并没有经济危机，它的生产正依靠高度的技术和先进的苏维埃科学的成就而不断地益臻完善。在战后年代中，一切工业部门都装备了新的机器和机械，应用了更完善的技术作业法，并对生产进行了更合理的组织。在这一时期中，由于补充了新的生产力更高的机器，工作母机的数量已增加到二点二倍。单在过去三年中，苏联机器制造业就生产了约一千六百种新型的机器和机械。
    我们的科学在促进技术的进一步发展方面起着巨大的作用；它正以它的发现来帮助苏联人民更详细地了解自然的富源和力量，并更有效地利用它们。在战争结束以后的时期中，我们的科学家已经成功地解决了许多具有巨大国民经济意义的科学问题。在这个时期中苏联科学的一个最重要的成就是发现了生产原子能的方法。这样，我们的科学与技术就结束了美国在这方面的垄断局面，给予战争挑拨者以严重打击，这些战争挑拨者曾尽力利用制造原子能的秘密和占有原子武器作为讹诈和恫吓其他国家人民的手段。苏维埃国家虽然掌握了生产原子能的真实可能性，仍然非常希望使这种新型的能量使用于和平目的，为人民谋幸福，因为这样利用原子能可以无限地扩展人类对自然界自发力量的控制，使人类有巨大的可能来提高生产力，在技术和文化上求进步，并增加社会财富。
    苏联科学和技术的巨大成就可以从每年颁发的奖励卓越科学著作、发明和生产方法根本改进的斯大林奖金得到证明。有八千四百七十位科学、工业、运输和农业工作者荣获了斯大林奖金获得者的光荣称号。
    工业发展的一个重要成果是苏联东部的工业在这个时期中有了飞速的发展，结果我国工业的分布状况大大地改变了。我国东部——伏尔加河流域、乌拉尔、西伯利亚、远东、哈萨克苏维埃社会主义共和国和中央亚细亚的各加盟共和国——已经建立起我国强大的工业基地。到一九五二年，这些地区的工业总产量已增为一九四零年的三倍。一九五一年，东部地区的工业生产量占全苏联工业生产量的三分之一左右，钢和压延金属占一半以上，煤和石油几乎占一半，电力占百分之四十以上。
    这就是苏联工业的发展在报告所谈到的时期内所获得的主要成就。
    今后数年内我国工业发展方面的任务已由关于苏联发展第五个五年计划的指示草案指出了，这个指示草案已提交这次代表大会审查。这些任务是：到一九五五年，把工业生产水平提高到比一九五○年高百分之七十左右；生产资料的产量约增加百分之八十，消费品产量约增加百分之六十五。这种提高工业生产量的任务意味着：到一九五五年，工业生产量将为一九四○年的三倍。
    第五个五年计划意味着：我国在从社会主义走向共产主义的道路上，又迈进了一大步。（鼓掌）
    我们的工业具备着完成这些行将担负起的各项任务的一切可能性。今天工业各部门都装备了更完善的机器都有熟练的工人、工程师和技术人员，工业企业也不感到原料和材料的缺乏。现在的问题是充分地利用这些可能性，坚决地消灭工作中的一切缺点，发掘生产中的未加利用的后备力量并把它变成发展国民经济的强大力量。
    工业不仅每年完成国家计划，而且还超额完成国家计划。但是整个工业的良好工作的总指数还掩盖着不少企业的低劣工作，这些企业没有完成国家指定的任务，结果国民经济没有得到相当数量的产品。但是政府各部也没有采取应有措施来保证每个企业完成计划，而往往把原来交给工作低劣的企业的任务转交给先进的企业。因此，工作低劣的企业就依靠先进的企业来过活。
    这些企业所以没有能完成国家计划的主要原因之一，是它们在每个月份中的生产不均匀。党曾一再向经济方面的领导者指出这种缺点。但是即使在现在还有不少的企业是时作时辍地工作，它们把差不多半个月的生产计划放到最后的十天中完成，这就引起了开工不足、加班赶工、废品增加以及妨害有关企业的工作等现象。
    有些企业为了完成总生产量的计划，竟至采取违反国家利益的办法，超额地生产次要货品，而不去完成国家计划所规定的关于生产极重要货品的任务。有些工业部门违犯国家规定的产品质量标准。给消费者制造不合规定标准和技术条件的次货，这些事实是大家知道的。机器制造工厂在设计工作尚未全部完成时，把不合用的、设计尚未完成的机器图样拿去制造。轻工业企业还在生产大量降低质量的货物。这些现象都是对国民经济有害的。工业工作中的这些缺点是不能容忍的。国家的计划就是法律。所有的企业必须完成国家交给它们的任务，保证国民经济得到它所需要的产品。经济方面和党组织的领导者有责任保证每个企业不仅在总产量方面而且绝对地在按照国家的计划生产一切物品方面完成计划，有责任为了有计划地提高产品质量而努力，有责任查究并完全消灭妨碍企业正常工作的原因。
    对于保证不断地尽量提高工业各部门的劳动生产率的任务，应该予以特别的注意。
    在社会主义建设的各个阶段，我们的党一直在为有计划地提高劳动生产率而努力，因为它是提高并改进社会主义生产的极重要条件。这是苏联的生产发展工作得到了巨大进展的主要原因。从一九四○年到一九五一年，工业方面的劳动生产率提高了百分之五十，而这个时期工业产量的增加有百分之七十是由于劳动生产率的提高。在建筑业方面，劳动生产率在同一个时期中提高了百分之三十六。
    苏联劳动生产率的迅速提高，主要是由于国民经济中广泛地使用新机器和采用先进的技术作业法，生产机械化和电气化，特别是费力的、沉重的工作机械化，以及劳动组织的改善，劳动人民一般教育水平和文化水平的提高和业务熟练程度的提高。社会主义经济制度为使用最新改良的机器提供了无限的机会。在苏联，机器不仅能节省劳动力，并且还能减轻工作者的劳动。因此，在社会主义经济条件之下，工人们非常喜欢在劳动过程中使用机器，在资本主义制度下，情形则不是这样。苏联工人是直接关心提高劳动生产率的，因为他知道这样就可以巩固苏联经济的力量和提高劳动人民的生活水平。社会主义制度下高度社会劳动生产率的基础就是国家和人民的利益的一致。
    可是，在我国工业方面，提高劳动生产率的现有可能性还远没有加以充分利用。首先，这可以从许多企业没有完成它们提高劳动生产率的计划看出来。应当指出，政府各部对这个重要的问题，没有予以足够的注意；政府各部不是确保每一个企业都完成它的提高劳动生产率的任务，而往往满足于整个部门所取得的平均成绩，而没有采取适当措施使落后企业达到先进企业的水平。
    在许多企业中，由于未能很好地利用现有的机械化工具，劳动生产率的提高受到了阻碍；对装备采取漠不关心和任其浪费的态度这样不可容忍的事实是存在着的。在任何企业中，生产的机械化必然要随着腾出一部分工人来，从而可以用他们在这个企业中扩大生产；或到新企业中去工作。但是，若干企业领导者不是努力使机械化工具得到适当的利用，以提高劳动生产率，而往往是以旧的方法来管理企业，大量使用手工劳动。
    生产机械化方面的另一个严重缺点是，在生产过程的机械化方面，有些部门不是完全没有机械化，就是机械化不够。在许多主要生产过程已经高度机械化的企业中，辅助工作，包括原料、材料和制成品的送达搬运和装载之类费力的工作，则很少机械化。所有这些都减少了机械化的全盘经济效果，并妨害了正常生产。
    妨碍劳动生产率之提高的另一个障碍是，在许多企业和建筑工地，劳动组织不能令人满意，结果便浪费了许多工作时间。政府有关各部往往不经过充分研究实际需要，也不调查一下劳动力是否使用得当，便确定了企业或建筑工地的工人数目。在企业中，尤其是在建筑工地，工人的“流动性”仍然存在，这对生产危害很大。
        在提高劳动生产率方面，技术定额有很大的意义。可是在许多企业中，技术定额规定得不能令人满意。那里仍然存在着减低的定额，所谓试验——统计定额，这种定额不符合现代生产技术水平，不能反映先进工人的经验，不能刺激劳动生产率的增长。这种试验——统计定额在许多企业中占的比例极大，超过现有生产定额的百分之五十。
    党组织、经济组织和工会组织的任务，就是迅速消灭妨碍劳动生产率提高的原因，保证国民经济各部门、各企业、各生产单位完成并超额完成提高劳动生产率的任务。必须坚决根除在利用我们现有丰富技术时发生的缺点，必须坚决执行生产过程的全部机械化和自动化的计划，必须在国民经济各部门更广泛地应用最新的科学和技术的成就，必须不断改进劳动和生产的组织形式和方法，必须更好地使用劳动力。
    同志们！我们的工业在不断扩大、发展，一天比一天变得更强大，在技术上更臻完美。我们将继续以各种方法来发展我们社会主义工业的生产力，这是我们祖国实力的基础和增进苏联人民物质福利的基础。（经久不息的鼓掌）
    乙、农业
    在报告谈到的这个时期开始的时候，即在第十八次代表大会的时候，我国的集体农庄制度已经非常巩固，集体农庄已经加强，社会主义经济制度已经确定为唯一的农业形式了。
    战争暂时使农业的发展停顿下来，并使它遭受了重大损失，特别是在沦陷区，希特勒侵略者在那里破坏了、掠夺了集体农庄、农业机器站和国营农场。可是，尽管战时的困难是很大的，但东部地区的集体农庄和国营农场却毫不间断地以粮食供给军队和人民，以原料供给轻工业。如果没有集体农庄制度，如果没有集体农庄男女庄员们的奋不顾身的劳动，如果没有他们的高度政治觉悟和高度组织性，我们就不能解决这个极困难的任务。
    在转向和平建设时，党面临了以最快的速度恢复和进一步发展农业的任务。在战后时期，党特别关切的，是在组织上和经济上巩固集体农庄，帮助它们恢复和进一步发展公有经济，并在这个基础上增进集体农庄庄员们的物质福利。小集体农庄的合并对于农业生产力的进一步发展，具有重大的意义，因为大集体农庄能够更顺利地发展并改进它们的公有经济。目前有九万七千个合并成的大集体农庄，而在一九五○年一月一日的时候，它们是二十五万四千个小集体农庄。
    由于党和政府所采取的措施的实现，农业方面因战争以及接踵而来的一九四六年的严重旱灾所引起的困难已经胜利地克服了，在短时期内，已经恢复了而且超过了战前的农产品生产水平。
    战后数年中，播种面积迅速恢复了，收获量提高了，谷物、技术作物、饲料作物、蔬菜、瓜类以及其他农作物的总产量也增加了。一九五二年各种农作物的播种面积超过了战前水平五百三十万公顷。
    战后的第三年，谷物生产量恢复了战前水平，随后几年中又增加了，同时，商品谷物也大大提高了。今年（一九五二年），谷物的总收获量达八十亿晋特，（暴风雨般的鼓掌）而最重要的粮食作物——小麦——的总收获量比一九四○年增加了百分之四十八。（鼓掌）
    以前认为最为尖锐、最为严重的问题——谷物问题——就这样顺利地解决了，彻底而无可改变地解决了。战后时期中棉花和糖萝卜生产的发展特别迅速：一九五一年原棉的总产量超过战前水平百分之四十六，糖萝卜超过百分之三十一。这些极重要的作物在今年已得到更丰稔的收获。榨油作物、马铃薯和饲料作物的产量已超过了战前水平；而且，一九五一年多汁的饲料（根类饲料作物、瓜类饲料作物和秣草作物）的总收获量比一九四○年增加了百分之二十五。亚麻、蔬菜和瓜类作物的产量在战后几年中已大大增加。可是，由于党、苏维埃和农业机关对于这些必需的作物的生产未予以足够的注意，许多州内亚麻和蔬菜的产量仍未达到战前水平。
    今年和往年一样，国家收购谷物、棉花、糖萝卜、含油种籽、马铃薯、蔬菜和其他农产品以及饲畜业产品的计划正在顺利完成中。
    我国的农业技艺日益熟练；它的出产日益丰富，它为市场生产的产品日益增多。我们必须了解我国农业发展的这个极重要的特点。现在，既然谷物问题已经顺利地解决了，农业方面所获得的成就就可以不再用老办法，即仅仅用谷物的产量来衡量了。从上面列举的材料中可以看出，除了谷物生产方面的成绩外，我们在发展棉花、糖萝卜、榨油作物、饲料作物和其他农作物的生产方面也取得了巨大的成绩。我们今天的农业在质量上已起了变化；它与生产力很低的、采取粗放农作法的旧式农业有根本的区别。一九五二年苏联的各种作物的播种面积为一九一三年的一点四倍，谷物的播种面积增加了百分之五，而技术作物、蔬菜和瓜类作物的播种面积则增加到二点四倍以上，饲料作物的播种面积增加到十一倍以上。目前技术作物的价值占商品农作物总值的百分之四十以上。因此，如果仅仅用谷物生产的水平来估计农业方面的成就，那就犯了严重的错误。
    在战后几年中，我们十分注意用新技术来装备农业。否则，我们就不可能在短短的时期内解决恢复并进一步发展农业的任务。现在农业机器的总额中又包括进大量新的、改良了的柴油引擎履带式拖拉机、自动推进联合收割机、干草收割机、糖萝卜联合收割机、亚麻联合收割机、摘棉机以及其他生产力很高的机器。农业机器站和国营农场所拥有的拖拉机的总马力比战前增加了百分之五十九，联合收割机的总马力增加了百分之五十一。
    农业得到了使饲畜业中的费力操作机械化的许多新机器。随着战后几年中农业和林业工作机械化程度的大大提高，农业机器站网扩大了，许多造林站、牧场改良站和饲畜业机器站已经设立起来，以便使种植防护林带的工作、排水和草原牧场的改良工作以及饲畜业中的费力操作机械化。在这个时期中，总共设立了一千五百四十六个新的农业机器站、造林站、牧场改良站和饲畜机器站，使目前这几种机器站的总数增至八千九百三十九个之多。
    战后在农业发展方面所获得的成就，已创造了能够在农业方面完成更大任务的条件。国民经济的利益和进一步改善苏联人民福利的任务，都要求更大地扩大农产品的生产。在关于第五个五年计划的指示草案中，规定在五年中总收获量增加如下：谷类百分之四十到五十，其中小麦百分之五十五到六十五，原棉百分之五十五到六十五，麻百分之四十到五十，糖萝卜百分之六十五到七十，向日葵百分之五十到六十，马铃薯百分之四十到四十五，饲料作物的生产约增加两三倍。
    现在，战前播种面积的水平既已恢复并且超过，增加农业产量的唯一正确路线就是用各种可能的方法进一步提高收获量。提高收获量是农业的主要任务。为了顺利地完成这个任务，那就必须提高田间工作的质量，缩短田间工作的时间，改善使用拖拉机和其他农业机器，完成农业上主要工作的机械化，保证迅速在集体农庄和国营农场中实施多年生草类轮种制，改善种籽的种植，在各处实施正确的耕作制度，增加肥料和灌溉地的面积。必须加强农业机器站在集体农庄中的组织作用，提高农业机器站对于完成农作物收获量和总产量的计划以及对于发展饲畜业的责任。
    我们的农业必须把生产率和效率提高到更高的水平，必须有高度发展的牧草种植和正确的作物轮种制，必须分配更多的土地来种植技术作物、饲料作物、蔬菜和马铃薯。
    由于在农业高涨中所获得的重大成就，大力发展饲畜业就成为党和政府在战后年代中发展农业的中心任务。在从一九四五年七月到一九五二年七月的期间，苏联的牛增加了一千三百五十万头，羊四千一百八十万只，猪二千一百二十万只，马五百六十万匹。一九四八年各种牛的头数已达到战前一九四○年的水平，一九五○年羊的只数和今年猪的只数也都先后达到一九四○年的水平。为了使饲畜业产品的生产有稳固的基础，党曾特别注意发展公有的集体农庄和国营农场的出产丰富的饲畜业。现在，集体农庄和国营农场的饲畜业，无论在牲畜头数中所占的比重方面或者在饲畜业产品生产方面，都在国内占绝对优势。整个苏联的肉类、乳类、油类、蛋类、兽毛和皮革的总产量和商品产量，都已超过了战前的水平。    （鼓掌）
    为了满足人民对牲畜产品的日益增加的需要，为了满足轻工业对原料的日益增加的需要，饲畜业必须进一步大大发展。在关于第五个五年计划的指示草案中，规定在五年内整个农业方面的牛的头数要增加百分之十八到二十，而属于集体农庄公有的牛的头数则要增加百分之三十六到三十八；羊的只数总共增加百分之六十到六十二，而集体农庄的羊的只数则增加百分之七十五到八十；猪的只数总共增加百分之四十五到五十，集体农庄的猪的只数则增加百分之八十五到九十；马的匹数总共将增加百分之十到十二，集体农庄的马的匹数将增加百分之十四到十六；集体农庄的家禽只数将增加到三倍至三倍半。指示草案规定牲畜产品增加的数目如下：肉类和油脂增加百分之八十到九十，奶类增加百分之四十五到五十，兽毛增加到两倍至两倍半，蛋类（集体农庄和国营农场的）增加到六倍至七倍。
    公有的集体农庄和国营农场牲畜头数的增加及其产品的同时大量增加今后仍然是饲畜业发展中的主要任务。为了顺利地完成这项任务，首先必须在所有的集体农庄和国营农场建立巩固的饲料基地，保证牲畜有良好的牲畜栏，并使饲畜业的工作广泛地机械化。
    必须把饲畜业发展成一个出产丰富的、能提供大量商品畜产品的和收益很大的饲畜业。在改良集体农庄和国营农场牲畜的品种方面，在保证现有品种的牲畜迅速繁殖方面，以及在创造出产丰富的农业上用的牲畜的新品种方面，还必须继续努力。只有使牲畜头数的增加与品种的改良及畜产品的增加正确地配合起来，饲畜业的正常发展才有可能。
    国营农场在战后时期大大地发展和巩固了；它们的耕种面积比战前时期大大地扩大了，它们的出产丰富的牲畜的头数，播种面积和农产品的生产也都增加了。但是国营农场的工作中还存在着严重的缺点。许多国营农场工作中的主要缺点之一就是谷物、肉类、乳类和其他产品的成本很高。国营农场必须发展许多部门的经济，改进生产组织，实行一切最费力的工作的全部机械化，增加农业作物的收获量和畜产品生产率，以便保证进一步增加对市场的供应，并大大降低生产成本。
    对于农业的进一步发展有重大意义的，是灌溉工程的进行和防护林带的植造。许多以现代技术装备起来的巨大灌溉系统在战前就建设好了，旧的灌溉系统也加以改建了；因此，中央亚细亚的各共和国和苏联其他地区实际受灌溉的土地面积就增加到一倍半，这样，就使得顺利完成像大大提高棉花生产这样重要的任务成为可能。植造防护林带的工作已经开始了。
    建设灌溉系统和植造防护林带的工作在战后几年中采取了更大的规模。南高加索各共和国正在兴建巨大的灌溉系统，这个工程完成后，这个地区实际受灌溉的土地面积在最近几年中将增加到一倍半。灌溉中央黑土地带（库尔斯克、奥勒尔、佛罗聂兹和坦波夫各州）土质十分肥沃但常闹旱灾的土地以便保障谷物、技术作物和其他作物的收获的工作，自一九四七年以来，就一直在进行。在苏联欧洲部分草原和森林草原地带各州植造巨大的国家防护林带，在集体农庄和国营农场上建造防风林以及开凿池塘和水库的工作，自一九四八年以来，就一直在大规模地进行着。在过去三年半中，集体农庄、国营农场和林场已经在二百六十万公顷的土地上植造了防护林，并建造了一万二千多个池塘和水库。在雨水过多的地区，首先是白俄罗斯和波罗的海沿岸的各共和国，像战前一样，正在进行吸干沼泽和低湿地带的巨大工程。
    由于伏尔加河、顿河、第聂伯河和阿姆·达里亚河上的巨大水电站和灌溉系统的建造，由于以弗·伊·列宁的名字命名的伏尔加河—顿河运河的通航，在农业面前展开了广阔的远景。这些水电站和灌溉系统的建造将保证我们再灌溉六百多万公顷的新土地，利用分区灌溉把水引到另外的二千二百万公顷的牧场，并为农业生产的电气化、电耕的实施、电动联合机以及其他电动农业机器的采用提供了广大的可能性。
    除了正在建造大规模的灌溉工程以外，全部受灌溉的土地上的灌溉系统正在顺利地改建成新的灌溉系统；在这种系统下，受灌溉的地区要大大地扩大，办法是：改善灌溉网支渠的分布，减少田地中的永久灌溉渠的数目，用临时灌溉渠来代替，这样就有可能更充分地利用受灌溉的土地和水，并为受灌溉的土地上的农业的机械化创造更有利的条件。
    计划中所规定的关于发展灌溉、植造防护林带和吸干沼泽地带的大规模工作的完成，将把我们的农业提高到更高的水平，我国可以永远不受气候变化的危害。我们的任务是在规定的时期内胜利地完成发展灌溉、植造防护林带和吸干沼泽地带的工作。党、苏维埃和经济组织必须特别注意这个工作。
    采取措施提高苏联欧洲部分非黑土地带各区的农业作物的收获量也是很重要的。大家知道，非黑土地带各区有着有利的气候条件和足够的雨水，因此，这些地区在顺利发展农业和饲畜业上是有很大可能的。
    可是，非黑土地带各区农作物的收获量仍然很低。而要使农作物年年丰收，就必须在这里首先在酸性土壤上大规模地施用石灰，同时施用足够数量的有机物肥料和矿质肥料，并以各种办法发展草类的播种与改进耕作法。
    在恢复和发展农业的过程中，我们的党、苏维埃和农业机关在战后几年来已经改进了它们对于集体农庄、农业机器站以及国营农场的领导。但是，在这项工作中仍然存在着错误和缺点。
    在农业领导上的错误和缺点是什么呢？在这方面的任务又是什么呢？
    首先，必须指出，我们的一些领导工作者，特别是在合并较小集体农庄的工作上，采取了错误的、狭隘的功利主义的办法，来解决集体农庄的建设问题。他们建议迅速大规模重建农村，以组成大型的集体农庄镇，消灭所有旧有的集体农庄建筑、农民房屋，在新的地址建立起大型的“集体农庄镇”、“集体农庄城”和“农业城”，认为这是在组织上和经济上加强集体农庄的工作中的最重要的任务。这些同志所犯的错误是：他们忘记了集体农庄面前的主要的生产任务，而把一些枝节问题、狭隘的功利主义的工作，和集体农庄中生活的安排问题放在第一位。
    毫无疑问，舒适的生活的安排问题是很重要的，但是它们毕竟是枝节的，从属的，而不是主要的问题，而且，生活的安排问题只有在发展公共生产的基础之上，才能顺利地解决。如果忘记或过低估计主要的生产任务，那就会把我们在农村中的全部实际工作引上不正确的道路，就会阻碍集体农场的进一步的发展，并且会使生活的安排和所有社会主义建设的工作都受到损害。党及时地采取了措施来纠正集体农庄建设方面的这种不正确的倾向。党、
    苏维埃和农业机关必须继续对集体农庄的公共经济——集体农庄的主要力量——的巩固与发展予以经常的关注，并且在这个基础上，保证增加集体农庄供应市场的生产，并进一步提高集体农庄庄员的物质和一般生活条件。
    其次，还须指出，许多集体农庄和国营农场都在普遍地建立制造砖瓦和其他工业品的附属企业。经验证明：这样就增加了建筑材料和工业产品的成本，而尤其重要的是，这样就分散了集体农庄和国营农场的力量，使它们不能好好地去解决农业生产问题，反而妨碍了农业的发展。这种情况必须予以纠正，集体农庄和国营农场必须集中全部力量来进一步发展多种部门的农业生产，以便充分利用它们的经济后备力和自然条件，使谷物、棉花、糖萝卜、亚麻、马铃薯、肉类、乳类、蛋类、兽毛、蔬菜、水果、茶叶以及其他农产品的产量尽可能增加。至于建筑材料和其他工业品，我们的国家工业和生产合作社已经能够而且必须充分地以低价对集体农庄和国营农场供应所有这些产品。
    其次，必须承认，浪费集体农庄的财产及其他违反农业劳动组合规章的情况仍然存在。党、苏维埃和农业机关中的某些工作人员，不但不保护集体农庄的公共经济的利益，反而自己盗窃集体农庄的财产；他们粗暴地违反苏维埃法律，在他们与集体农庄发生关系时，采取蛮不讲理的手段，恣意破坏法律。这些工作人员利用他们的职位来占据公有的土地，迫使集体农庄管理委员会和主席免费或低价供应他们谷物、肉类、乳类以及其他物品，他们以他们自己的产品很少的牲畜交换集体农庄的产品很多的、比较值钱的牲畜，以及诸如此类的事。所有这些不利于集体农庄、不利于国家的行动，使集体农庄庄员遭受严重的损害，妨碍了集体农庄在组织方面和经济方面的进一步巩固，破坏了党和苏维埃国家的威信。必须坚决制止破坏农业劳动组合规章的行为，应该把盗窃集体农庄财产的人当作集体农庄制度的敌人，按照社会主义国家的法律，给以极严厉的惩处。
    其次，必须指出，党、苏维埃和农业机关处理像集体农庄的劳动组织问题这样重要的问题的情况，是不能令人满意的。大家知道，在集体农庄的劳动组织工作上，某些领导人采取了不正确的路线，在集体农庄内使用特殊化的工作小组，取消了生产工作队；这种做法实际上是反对谷物耕作的机械化，结果就引起集体农庄的削弱。为了消灭这些错误和歪曲而做的工作可以使我们大大改善集体农庄的劳动组织工作及加强生产工作队。可是，在这一方面，仍然有着重大的缺点。许多集体农庄没有成员固定的生产工作队；生产资料没有分配给各个生产队专营专用，这样就产生了无人负责现象；由于管理不善，大部分工作时间被浪费了，这样就减低了集体农庄庄员的劳动生产率而使生产工作没有按时完成党、苏维埃和农业机关必须天天努力改进集体农庄的劳动组织工作。在集体农庄内应实行更进步的收入分配制度，根据这种制度，集体农庄的成员按照他们进行工作的劳动日单位的数目而且直接根据工作队、工作小组或每个集体农庄庄员所生产的农产品的实际数量，来分配集体农庄的收入。这将大大提高集体农庄庄员的劳动生产率，完全消除报酬平均化的现象，并进一步增加劳动日单位的价值。
    此外，必须指出，农业工作的领导机关用千篇一律的公式化的办法来解决许多实际问题的现象仍然没有消灭。党、苏维埃和农业机关的领导者往往忽视当地的具体情况，而就农业技术、牲畜饲养、劳动组织以及其他农业问题向所有区、所有集体农庄、农业机器站和国营农场发出同样的指示，这些指示对某些区和农场虽是正确的和必要的，但对其他的区和农场常常是无用的，有时甚至是有害的。在党、苏维埃和农业机关的工作人员中，仍有不少人根据所谓平均指数来判断和试图领导农业。
    这些工作人员根据平均的统计数字来判断收获量，而对畜产品生产率也是这样判断。满足于平均统计数字的人就看不到落后的区、集体农庄和国营农场的糟糕情况。因此就不可能及时采取有效的措施给它们以必要的帮助。另一方面，从这些平均指数中也不可能看到先进的区、集体农庄和国营农场，对于它们来说，根据平均指数所派定的任务，就不能刺激它们更好地进行工作，只会延缓和妨碍它们的发展。
    最后，必须谈一谈在农业中应用科学成就及先进经验方面存在的主要缺点。我们有许多先进的集体农庄，农业机器站与国营农场；有数以千计的先进的农业生产工作者，他们创造地应用了科学成就，从而大大提高了收获量和畜产品生产率。但是宣传先进经验并把它应用到集体农庄和国营农场生产中的工作仍然不能令人满意。我们的农业科学对农业的发展作了很大的贡献。农业科学中的反科学的和反动的思想已经被揭露和打倒了，这门科学现在是在唯一正确的基础上——在唯物主义的米丘林学说的基础上——发展着，并武装我们的工作人员在实际活动中来发展农业。但是尽管农业科学获得了这样的成就，它仍然不能适应集体农庄和国营农场生产的需要。社会主义的农业制度给科学开辟了一条宽阔的道路，它使迅速推广科学成就和先进经验成为可能，它使所有的集体农庄、农业机器站和国营农场都能够应用这些成就和经验。现在党、苏维埃和农业机关有着一项最重要的责任，就是用一切办法发挥科学工作人员和实际工作人员的主动创造精神，扩大在提高收获量和饲畜业的产品生产率方面有显著成绩的农民的队伍，支持一切先进的和进步的事物，更快地把农业方面的科学成就与先进经验应用到集体农庄与国营农场生产的各方面去。
    同志们！我们大家都为我们的社会主义农业的巨大发展而欢欣。我们的农作业和饲畜业现在正处在蓬勃的新的高涨中。毫无疑问，在今后几年中，我们有着良好机器设备的集体农庄、农业机器站和国营农场在发展农业方面将获得更重大的成就，我们的国家将有充分的粮食供给人民，将有充分的原料供给迅速发展着的轻工业。（经久不息的鼓掌）
    丙、商品流转、运输和邮电
    随着我国的工业和农业的发展，商品流转也有了发展。在战后几年中，国营贸易和合作社贸易的商品流转额增加到二点九倍，大大超过了战前水平。在一九五一年，国营商店和合作社商店售给人民的肉类和肉制品比一九四○年增加百分之八十；鱼类和鱼制品增加了百分之六十；动物油增加百分之八十；植物油及其他油脂差不多增为两倍；糖增加了百分之七十；织物增加了百分之八十；鞋类增加了百分之五十。国营和合作社零售贸易网扩大了，物品的种类大大增加了，质量也提高了。
    不过，在我们的贸易中仍然有许多严重的缺点。贸易机构仍然很少研究人民的需要；它们在运送和分配给各州和各共和国货物的工作中常犯错误。在某些地方，为购买者的服务做得很不够。目前的任务是在短期内消灭这些缺点，并把苏维埃贸易提高到新的更高的水平。在关于第五个五年计划的指示草案中规定在计划完成时把国营和合作社零售贸易额比一九五○年提高百分之七十左右。
    随着生产和商品流转的增加，各种运输与货运发展了。在伟大卫国战争年代里，我们的运输、特别是铁路运输胜利地完成了保证军需和国民经济必需品供应的艰巨任务。在战后的数年中，各种运输不仅恢复了，而且比战前大大发展了。与一九四○年比较，过去一年铁路货运量增加了百分之八十左右，内河和海路货运量增加了百分之六十，汽车货运量增加到三点一倍，民用航空货运量增加到九点二倍。过去一年中铁路平均每日车厢载运量比一九四○年约增加百分之四十。
    今天各种运输都有了更加巩固的技术基础。由于复轨的恢复和新复轨的敷设、支线的扩展、重型铁轨的敷设、自动闭塞装置的扩展以及其他措施，铁路主要干线的载运量增加了；新的铁路筑成了，并且通车了；使货运最频繁的铁路电气化的工作仍在继续进行中；机车和车厢大大增加了——马力强大的机车和载运量很大的车厢更是大大增加了。
    在水路运输方面，一九五一年内河航线的长度比一九四○年增加了二万三千公里。海运和内河运输已随着货船和客船的增加而扩大了。
    一九四○年以来，装卸工作的机械化程度大大地提高了；一九五一年，内河航运部方面增加了百分之八十三，海上运输部方面增加了百分之九十。
    汽车运输配备了新的、更完善的货车和客车。比起一九四○年来，路面改进了的公路网扩充到三点一倍。
    战后几年中，诸如邮政、电报、电话和无线电之类的通讯工具进一步发展了。全国的电话和电报系统扩大了，城市电话的通话能力也提高了。现在所有区的中心城市与州的中心城市之间都有电话和电报联系；村苏维埃和农业机器站装设电话的工作也基本上完成了。无线电收听网现在几乎是一九四○年的两倍。邮递工作大大地扩展了；邮政航空线的长度增加到两倍半。
    和获得成就的同时，运输和邮电方面也有着严重的缺点。许多铁路企业、航运企业和汽车企业没有完成规定给它们的装卸和运货的计划。铁路车厢和船只的装卸工作中仍然有许多空闲时间。不合理的、过度远程的铁路货运的现象迄今还没有消灭。汽车运输工作仍然组织得很坏，载重车调度中有许多空闲时间，使用中的车辆跑空车的时候也很多。
    在邮电业的缺点方面，应该提到：邮电机关为国民经济和居民的需要服务仍然有不够准确的地方。
    必须进一步发展并改进各式运输与邮电的工作，爱护运输设备并且经常地注意修理保护，发展并加强各种类型的运输的技术设备，用一切方法改进邮递、电报与电话的工作。
    丁、实行严格的节约，这是进一步提高国民经济的一个极重要手段
    苏联是依靠自己的资源，依靠它内部资金积累的来源来发展国民经济的。因此，我们党过去和现在一直非常注意实行最严格的节约，把厉行节约当做在国民经济中创造资金积累和正确利用积累资金的极重要的条件。作为社会主义管理的方法，厉行节约对国家工业化曾起了重要的作用。既然现在我们的国民经济又有一次突飞猛进的高涨，同时日用必需品的价格又在降低，厉行节约就显得更加重要了。生产资源愈能充分地、合理地加以利用，我们愈能精打细算地管理我们的经济，那末我们在国民经济各部门的发展方面获得的胜利就愈大，我们在提高人民物质和文化水平方面获得的成绩也就愈大。
    但是，在发掘和正确利用国民经济的内在资源方面，存在着严重的缺点。
    首先，必须指出企业方面的巨大损失和非生产的开支。在许多工业部门里面，生产能力仍然使用得很不适当。政府的许多部在决定企业的能力时就考虑着生产中的“困难”。在计算生产能力的时候，常常使用缩小了的设备生产率标准；在确定物品生产中所需要的劳动量定额时，并没有把先进的技术和改进了的劳动组织方法考虑在内。这些部不是更有效地利用企业的内在资源以提高生产量，反而不时要求政府投资建立新的企业。许多企业发生由于管理不善和浪费材料、原料、燃料、电力、工具和其它贵重物资而造成的巨大损失；此外，已确定的开支标准也经常被破坏；十分完美的代用品没有得到大力提倡；生产中还有大量的废品。譬如在一九五一年内，有全国意义的企业中的损失和非生产的开支总数达四十九亿卢布，其中有三十亿是由于废品造成的损失。
    由于生产能力的利用不当以及管理不善所引起的巨大损失，许多工业企业未能完成它们在降低生产成本方面的任务，它们容许浪费。在拟订生产成本的计划方面企业中也有巨大的缺点。某些经济负责人员由于考虑狭隘的本位的利益，不顾损害国家利益，用提高材料消耗定额以及毫无根据地提高生产各种物品所需的劳动量指标等方法，在降低生产成本的计划中人为地保留“后备力量”。某些企业中这种对国家利益有损的拟订生产成本计划的办法，表明了政府有关各部对这个问题没有实行应有的监督。政府有关各部不对每个企业的生产条件加以切实的研究，不采取必要的措施以保证有步骤地降低生产成本，而让生产成本计划不经过审查和批准，就拟订出来。
    其次，应当指出，厉行节约在建筑业方面特别做得不好。我们的建筑业仍然是花费很大的。建筑工人在降低生产成本方面远不及产业工人。在建筑业的组织方面有许多重大缺点，机械化的工具使用不当，劳动生产率很低，不合理地使用材料，杂费极高。在基本建设中的一个重大缺点是人力物力分散在许多建筑组织中，包括许多不能有效使用机械化工具的细小的建筑组织。所有这些都使建筑成本提高，使行政管理机构庞大，使杂费增加；例如，在一九五一年，建筑业方面的杂费比预算多十亿卢布以上，建筑业在这一年不但未能获得计划所预定的二十九亿卢布的利润，反而亏蚀了二十五亿卢布。
    再次，在农业方面也有巨大的损失和非生产的开支。目前农业机器装备的规模较战前大得许多。但在使用拖拉机和农业机器方面仍有重大缺点。许多农业机器站和国营农场在保养机器和拖拉机方面的情况是不能令人满意的，因此，机器不到时候就用坏了，机器修理方面的超额开支很大；燃料和滑润油的耗费也过大。所有这些都使拖拉机工作的成本提高。
    在许多农业机器站、集体农庄和国营农场中，管理不善的情况仍未消除；工作组织得不好，使收获量未能达到计划的标准，并使收获遭到巨大损失；对集体农庄财产的管理是不能令人满意的；由于牲畜饲养不良，许多集体农庄的牲畜病死的很多，畜产品的生产率很低。
    在运输方面，也有巨大的损失和非生产的开支。在许多铁路上，在许多轮船和汽车运输机构中，由于未能完成载运计划，车厢、轮船和载重车的停歇时间很长，燃料的额外消耗以及因管理不善而引起的许多损失，超支和亏损的数额是相当大的。以漫不经心的态度对待机车车辆、轮船和载重车因而给国家造成巨大损失的现象仍然很多。
    再次，农产品的采购、贮藏和销售方面的经费过大；贸易机构的业务开支也是很大的。采购、贸易和销售机构的工作人员过多。在中央和地方，许多采购和销售机构往往采购和销售同样的产品和原料。采购和销售的计划方面的缺点造成了不合理的、距离过长的运输。在采购、贮藏和销售农产品的工作中，杂费过高的现象是由于管理采购和销售机构的政府各部没有适当地注意减少杂费的问题，没有控制所采购的农产品的成本。由于政府有关各部没有控制成本，种种弊端就随着产生，以致使采购机构可以把一切损失和浪费都计算在采购费用内，以掩饰他们的管理不善。采购、供应和销售的组织工作缺乏适当的秩序，以及没有实行严格的节约，给国家造成了数十亿卢布的损失。
    最后，行政管理费的数额仍然很高。许多国家管理机关的工作人员在近年来已一再缩减。但这主要是在上级命令下按照行政手续实行的，削减行政管理机构的经费问题还没有成为各机关和各组织负责人员经常注意的问题。许多部、处容用超过定额的人员。各州、市和区的机关和机构也有大量超额人员。
    经验证明：由于行政管理机关工作的改进以及采购和销售的组织工作的改进，正腾出一部分工作人员，而且将来还会腾出一部分工作人员。经济机构和党组织有责任适当地使用这批腾出的工作人员来为发展国民经济服务。政府有关各部、劳动后备部、党和工会的组织必须注意使这些干部获得必要的生产技术，使他们能够到那些在发展中需要增加人员的经济部门中去发挥他们的能力。
    国民经济各个部门的浪费材料、金钱和人力的情况说明，许多负责人员已经忘记需要厉行节约，他们不关心合理地和节约地使用国家经费，他们对他们所负责的企业和机关中财务经济工作的改进没有予以适当的注意，党的组织没有注意这些缺点，也没有纠正这些负责人员的错误。
    目前的任务是制止经济方面的负责人员和党组织对于管理不善和浪费现象的漠不关心的态度。厉行节约的问题应当经常是我们的一切经济工作和党的工作的中心环节。我们应当经常注意以爱惜公共的、社会主义财产的精神教育苏联人民。必须根除一切浪费物资、人力和财力的现象，有计划地保证完成和超额完成降低产品成本的任务。必须加紧反对管理不善的现象；大刀阔斧地减少工业、建筑业、运输业、农业方面以及贸易、采购和销售机关中的杂费；采取坚决的步骤来简化国家机关和经济机关的机构，并减少其行政费；财政部门应通过卢布来加强对完成经济计划和厉行节约的控制。我们的经济工作人员必须完善地掌握社会主义的管理方法，必须提高他们的技术和经济知识，有计划地改进生产方法，寻找、发掘和利用国民经济的潜在力量。推进社会主义竞赛运动对于顺利完成发展国民经济的任务是十分重要的。党一向非常注意组织这种竞赛，并且认为，社会主义竞赛的主要目的是使落后的工人在工作中达到最优秀的工人的水平，向最优秀的工人看齐。在我们的社会的情况下，积极劳动的榜样在社会主义建设的各部门中起着很重要的作用。苏联人民从他们自己的经验中每天都体会到：由于有着生产组织的最优秀的范例，由于采用新技术与各种革新和发明，就必然使劳动减轻，并使劳动人民物质生活水平得以提高。在社会主义建设的所有部门，我们有许许多多的例子，可以用来表明劳动者怎样发挥主动创造精神以保证社会主义生产的不断发展和改进。我国人民很早就以富有主动创造精神、机智和发明的天才而著名于世。
    社会主义的敌人和他们的形形色色的应声虫们把社会主义说成是压制个性的制度。再没有比这种说法更幼稚，更粗鄙的了。事实已经证明：社会主义制度能够确保个性自由、个人和集体的创造力的发展，并且创造了从各方面发展隐藏在人民群众深处的才干与天才的有利条件。
    在我国，诚实的工作受到极大的尊重，而且受到及时的鼓励。党和政府正在广泛地实行以奖金和勋章授与在国民经济和文化各方面工作上获得成就的劳动人民的制度。自从卫国战争结束以来，苏联已经给一百三十四万六千名工人、集体农庄庄员、科学家、工程师、技术人员、职员、医生、教员及其他工作者颁发了勋章和奖章。为了表扬我国六千四百八十名劳动者卓越的革新家的活动，国家已授予他们社会主义劳动英雄的崇高称号。
    党、苏维埃、经济部门以及工会和共产主义青年团等组织的任务，是更广泛地扩大社会主义建设各方面的竞赛运动，极力鼓励工作中的优良范例及先进工作者和革新者的进步的创举，用种种方法在全体劳动人民群众中推广先进经验，借以帮助落后工人达到先进工人的水平。在新与旧、先进与落后之间的斗争中，重要的是不仅要看到创造新社会制度的力量，并且要不断发展这些力量，关心怎样用各种方法来发展他们，并为了顺利前进而不倦地组织它们，使之臻于完善。
    二、进一步提高人民生活的物质福利、保健及文化水平
    国民经济各部门的成就，使得苏维埃社会的物质和文化生活水平跟着进一步提高了。这是十分合乎规律的，除此以外，是不可能有其他结果的，因为在我们的国家中，社会主义生产的发展就是为了最高限度地满足社会上不断增加的物质和文化需要。
    苏联人民生活水平上升的主要标志，是国民收入的不断增加。从一九四○年到一九五一年，苏联国民收入增加了百分之八十三。与资本主义国家有着显著区别的是：在资本主义国家中，国民收入有一大半被剥削阶级夺去了，而在苏联，全部国民收入都是劳动人民的财产。国民收入的四分之三左右用来满足苏联劳动人民个人的物质和文化需要，其余的用来扩大社会主义生产和供给其他全国需要与社会需要。
    工人和职员的实际工资和农民实际收入的增加，最重要的来源是政府一贯采取的降低日用品价格的政策。由于在一九四七年到一九五二年五次降低国家零售价格的结果，目前食品和工业品的价格平均比一九四七年第四季低两倍。
    大家知道，我国工人和职员可以领到由国家付给的各种社会保险津贴，从社会赡养基金中领取养老金，免费或减费进疗养院、休养所和儿童保育机关，每年并有工资照付的假期。所有的城乡劳动人民都得到免费医疗。国家在城乡中发给儿女众多的母亲和单身母亲以津贴；国家保证初等学校和七年制学校的免费教育；给学生发助学金。城乡劳动人民在一九四○年所得到的上述补助和津贴的总值为四百零八亿卢布，一九五一年的总值则为一千二百五十亿卢布。
    由于工人和职员的货币工资的增加以及农民现金收入和实物收入的增加，由于日用品的减价以及国家给予人民的其他补助的增加，一九五一年工人和职员的实际收入平均每人较一九四○年增加了百分之五十七左右，农民的实际收入平均每人增加了百分之六十左右。
    关于第五个五年计划的指示草案，规定在五年期间使苏联的国民收入至少增加百分之六十，使工人和职员的实际工资至少增加百分之三十五（零售价格的降低计算在内）；并且使集体农庄庄员的现金收入和实物收入（以现金计算）至少增加百分之四十。
    住房建筑和市政建设在我们国内大规模地进行着。仅在战后几年内，城市和工人住房区修建了面积共一亿五千五百多万平方公尺的新住宅，在农业区域修建了三百八十多万幢住宅。在战争时期被占领过的地区，住房建筑的规模尤其庞大。但是尽管有大规模的住房建筑，我们国内仍有显著的房屋不足现象。政府有关各部和地方苏维埃一年接着一年地未能执行给它们规定的住房建设计划，使国家拨作这种用途的经费未能得到充分的利用。单在过去两年内，由于没有完成住房建筑计划，就耽误了四百多万平方公尺居住面积的住房的修建。还有许多经济方面的和党的负责人员把关心劳动人民的住房需要当作次要的事情，他们并未采取步骤去实行关于建筑和修理住房的计划。
    目前的任务是竭力扩充住房建筑。关于第五个五年计划的指示草案规定国家住房建筑方面的基本建设基金将增加为第四个五年计划的两倍左右。
    对于保障我国人民的健康，党和政府一向表示了、而且继续表示着极大的关怀。国家的保健经费，包括社会保险基金中用于这方面的经费在内，已自一九四○年的一百一十二亿卢布增加为一九五一年的二百六十四亿卢布。在这个基础上，公共的医药和卫生事业得到了进一步的改进和扩展。一九五一年，城市和乡村的医院的病床数目比一九四○年增加了百分之三十。疗养院网扩大了。全国医生人数增加了百分之八十。
    由于人民的物质和文化水平的提高和公共医疗事业的改进，我国的死亡率降低了。在过去三年中，人口净增了九百五十万。（经久不息的鼓掌）
    教育费已自一九四○年的二百二十五亿卢布增加为一九五一年的五百七十三亿卢布，也就是说，增加为两倍半以上。单说在战后几年中，就建筑了两万三千五百所学校。现在苏联的就学的人数为五千七百万，几乎比一九四○年多八百万。七年制和十年制的学校大量扩充了；从一九四○年到一九五一年，五年级到十年级的学生人数增加了百分之二十五。中等技术学校和其他中等专科学校的学生人数在这一段时期增加了百分之四十，而高等学校的学生人数则增加了百分之六十七。单在一九五二年，高等学校就有二十二万一千名青年专家毕业，到国民经济的各部门中工作，今年又招收了三十七万五千名新生。现在苏联约有五百五十万从高等学校或中等专科学校毕业的专家，也就是相当于战前的二点二倍。
    鉴于科学在我们社会生活中的意义一天天增大，党经常关心它的发展。苏维埃国家已着手建设和装备一个庞大的科学研究机关网，并为科学的发达创造了最有利的条件；苏维埃国家保证了大规模训练科学工作人员。在苏联，科学研究机关、实验室以及其他科学机关的数目在一九三九年为一千五百六十所，到一九五二年年初，就增加为二千九百所。科学工作人员的数目在这一段时期差不多增加为两倍。在一九四六年至一九五一年这一段时期内，国家用于发展科学的费用达四百七十二亿卢布。
    在过去几年中，城乡文化教育机关网广泛地扩充了。现在全国拥有三十六万八千个各种类型的图书馆。自一九三九年以来，图书馆增加了十二万多个。每年出版的书籍达八亿册，比一九四○年增加了一点八倍。从一九三九年到现在，城市和乡村的有声电影设备的数目几乎增加到三倍。
    苏维埃文化中极重要的和不可缺少的组成部分是文学和艺术。我们在苏联文学、造型艺术、戏剧和电影的发展中获得了重大的成就。显著的证明就是在这一方面每年都有许多天才的工作者获得斯大林奖金。有二千三百三十九位文学艺术工作者荣获了斯大林奖金得奖人这一崇高的称号。
    成就是很大的，但如果因为这些成就而看不到我国文学与艺术发展中的重大缺点，那就不对了。问题是，尽管在文学与艺术发展方面取得了重大的成就，但是许多作品的思想和艺术水平仍然不够高。我们的文学与艺术仍然产生了许多平庸乏味的灰色的作品，有时简直是歪曲苏联现实的粗制滥造的作品。在有些作家和艺术家的作品中，苏联社会的生气勃勃的和多方面的生活被描绘得毫无生气、枯燥乏味。在电影这样一个重要的、普及形式的艺术中缺点仍未消除。我们的电影工作者能够摄制有高度教育价值的好影片，但这种影片的数目还很少。我们的电影业具有生产很多不同类型的好影片的一切可能性，但这个可能性未能被很好地利用。
    必须考虑到，苏联人的思想和文化水平已经大大提高了；党正以最优秀的文学和艺术作品来培养他们的欣赏力。
    苏联人不能容忍乏味的、没有思想性的和不真实的作品，他们向我国作家和艺术家的创作提出了很高的要求。我们的作家和艺术家必须在作品中无情地批评在社会中遇到的错误、缺点和不健康现象；他们必须创造正面的艺术形象，表现新型人物的人格的光辉灿烂，在我们社会的人民中这样来帮助培养摆脱了资本主义所产生的毒疮和恶习的品质、习惯和风气。但是，在我们苏联的小说和戏剧方面，正如在电影方面一样，像讽刺之类的作品到今天仍然是缺乏的。如果认为我们苏维埃的现实没有可讽刺的材料，是不正确的。我们需要苏维埃的果戈理和谢德林，他们的讽刺像火一样把生活中的一切反面的、腐朽的和垂死的东西，一切阻碍进步的东西都烧毁了。
    我们的苏维埃文学和艺术必须大胆地表现生活的矛盾和冲突，必须善于使用批评的武器，把它当做一个有效的教育工具。现实主义艺术的力量和意义就在于：它能够而且必须发掘和表现普通人的高尚的精神品质和典型的、正面的特质，创造值得做别人的模范和效仿对象的普通人的明朗的艺术形象。
    在创造艺术形象时，我们的艺术家、文学家和艺术工作者必须时刻记住：典型不仅是最常见的事物而且是最充分、最尖锐地表现一定社会力量的本质的事物。依照马克思—列宁主义的了解，典型绝不是某种统计的平均数。典型性是和一定社会—历史现象的本质相一致的；它不仅仅是最普遍的、时常发生的和平常的现象。有意识的夸张和突出地刻划一个形象并不排斥典型性，而是更加充分地发掘它和强调它。典型是党性在现实主义艺术中表现的基本范畴。典型问题经常是一个政治性的问题。
    只有当我们对我们的艺术家和作家的粗劣作品进行了坚决的斗争的时候，只有当我们把文学和艺术作品中的虚伪性和腐朽性无情地加以根除的时候，文艺工作者面前的崇高任务才能顺利地解决。在培养社会生活中新鲜的、光辉的东西和根除衰老的、垂死的东西的伟大斗争中，我们的文艺工作者担负着巨大的责任。我们的作家、艺术家、作曲家和电影工作者的责任便是更加深入地研究苏维埃社会的生活，创造无愧于我国伟大人民的艺术巨著。（鼓掌）
    同志们，我们在增进苏联人民的物质福利和提高他们的文化方面，已取得巨大成就。但是，我们不能满足于现有的成就。我们的任务是：在整个国民经济发展的基础上保证继续不断提高苏联人民的物质与文化水平。我们党将继续不断表现不倦怠的关心怎样最大限度地满足苏联人民经常发展着的需要，因为苏联人的幸福和苏联人民的繁荣就是我们党的最高准绳。（暴风雨般的经久不息的鼓掌）
    三、苏维埃社会和国家制度的进一步巩固
    在从第十八次党代表大会以来的这段时期中，我们苏维埃国家继续发展着、壮大着。
    我们国家的经济基础——生产资料的社会主义所有制——已发展并巩固了。在这个时期中，组成苏维埃社会主义社会的工人、农民和知识分子之间的友好合作进一步加强了。
    在最大的困难面前，我们的社会和国家制度证明是世界上最坚强的、最富有生命力的和最稳固的，战争的经验已证明了这一点。苏维埃社会主义制度之所以具有不可摧毁的力量，是由于它是由人民自己建立起来的真正的人民的制度，它得到人民的大力支持，并保证人民的一切物质力量和精神力量的发扬光大。
    马克思主义的敌人与把马克思主义庸俗化的人们曾鼓吹一个对我们的事业极有害的理论，说在资本主义包围存在的情况下，苏维埃国家会衰亡下去。党击败并驳倒了这种腐烂的理论，提出并论证了一种结论，就是：在社会主义革命已经在一个国家内取得胜利、而资本主义还统治着其他大部分国家的情况下，革命取得胜利的国家决不可削弱它的国家，而必须尽一切力量巩固它的国家；就是在共产主义制度下，国家仍须保存，如果那时资本主义包围还存在的话。如果我们过去听任我们的国家衰弱下去，那么我们就不可能获得我们今天引以自豪的、我们在和平建设中所获得的成就。如果我们过去没有巩固我们的国家、我们的军队、我们的惩罚与侦查机关，我们就会发现我们在敌人面前是赤手空拳，有遭受军事失败的危险的。党已使苏维埃国家成为一个牢不可破的社会主义的堡垒，因为它过去曾经、现在还继续尽最大的力量巩固着社会主义国家。（暴风雨般的鼓掌）
    当法西斯侵略者进攻我们国家的时候，他们指望苏维埃社会和国家制度的内部不稳，指望苏联的后方虚弱。但是，大家都知道，战争打翻了他们的如意算盘。斯大林同志说过：一旦发生战事，我国的前方与后方，由于他们的同心协力和内部团结，会比任何其他国家的前方与后方都要坚强。他这个历史性的论断完全被证实了。在战争中，苏维埃强国的武装部队和后方变得更强大了。苏联人民在后方的忘我劳动，和苏联陆军与海军在前线的英勇斗争，将以人民保卫祖国的史无前例的伟绩而永垂史册。我们的陆军和海军是在斯大林同志的直接领导下建立起来，壮大起来，和进行战斗的。（暴风雨般的经久不息的鼓掌）天才的军事领袖、苏联人民在伟大卫国战争中获得的历史性胜利的组织者斯大林同志创造了先进的、苏维埃军事科学，并以战胜敌人的艺术武装了我们的军队。我国人民热爱他们的陆军和海军，经常地关怀他们，注意他们。苏联的武装部队过去是、现在是、将来也是我们祖国安全的可靠屏障。（暴风雨般的经久不息的鼓掌）
    伟大的卫国战争以及战后的和平发展的年月再一次说明了在党的领导下建立起来的苏维埃社会制度是最好的社会组织形式；苏维埃国家制度是一个多民族国家的典范。资产阶级阵营里的我们的许多敌人和心怀恶意的人们一直喋喋不休地硬说多民族的苏维埃国家是一个不稳固的国家，他们把希望寄托在苏联各族人民的分裂上，而且预言苏联的崩溃是无可避免的。
    他们以他们的资产阶级国家的标准来衡量我们的国家，因为在他们的国家里是存在着民族间的矛盾和纷争的。社会主义的敌人不能了解：由于伟大的十月革命和社会主义改造的结果，我国各族人民，已在完全平等的基础上，以一种坚固的友谊紧紧地联系在一起了。（鼓掌）我们的党，坚持不渝地奉行列宁—斯大林的民族政策，巩固多民族的苏维埃国家，发展苏联各族人民之间的友谊和互相合作，在各方面支持、保障和鼓励我国各族人民文化的进步，并对所有形形色色的民族主义分子进行不调和的斗争。经受了战争的严重考验并已成为全世界真正民族平等与合作的榜样和典范的苏维埃国家制度，显示列宁—斯大林关于民族问题的理论的伟大胜利。（经久不息的鼓掌）
    我们党现在和将来都要像卫护我们的眼珠一样来卫护苏联各族人民的团结和友谊，党过去巩固了，今后还要继续巩固多民族的苏维埃国家。（暴风雨般的鼓掌）
    在报告谈到的这段时期内，又有新的民族加入了苏维埃大家庭。立陶宛、摩尔达维亚、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚各苏维埃社会主义共和国相继成立了。整个乌克兰民族团聚在统一的国家里。白俄罗斯已把整个白俄罗斯民族团结在一个家庭中了。在西北部，我们现在有了更公正的，更符合于国防利益的新疆界。在远东，苏联收复了以前从俄国分割出去的库页岛南部和千岛群岛。现在苏联的国界比从前任何时候都更加符合于我国各族人民的历史发展情况。
    在许多兄弟共和国人民的帮助下，一些新的加盟共和国在短短的时期内不仅在工业化方面有了很大的进展，而且把小农经济转上了社会主义的道路，完成了集体化工作，并且正在顺利地发展社会主义农业。
    在战后时期，我们国家的基本机能——经济组织和文化教育的机能——发展了，并且更为加强了。社会主义建设的迅速进展和使党和苏维埃的领导深入区、镇和村的任务，要求在我国的行政区划方面实行许多改革，需要成立新的州、专区和区。国民经济的增长需要进一步改变工业、农业以及国民经济其他方面各部门的国家管理机构的组织形式。这一点反映在中央国家管理机构编制的紧缩和新机构的成立上。
    对于巩固我们国家具有最大意义的，是始终不渝地实行作为斯大林宪法之基础的社会主义民主原则。在战后时期中，苏联最高苏维埃、加盟共和国与自治共和国最高苏维埃及地方劳动者代表苏维埃，都经过了两次选举。
    这些选举是在伟大的政治高潮中举行的，它们再度表现了我国人民的团结和人民对于我们共产党及苏维埃政府的无限信任。（暴风雨般的鼓掌）
    党在国内政策方面的任务是：
    （1）继续坚定不移地加强我们国家的经济力量，组织与领导苏维埃人民的和平劳动，以完成与超额完成作为从社会主义过渡到共产主义期间之重要阶段的第五个苏联发展五年计划中规定的重大任务；
    （2）促进工业与运输业进一步的发展。把科学与技术方面的最新成就更广泛地利用在工业、建筑业与运输业方面，用一切方法提高劳动生产率、加强纪律以完成国家计划，并保证产品的优良质量。不断地降低产品成本，因为这是不断降低所有物品的批发与零售价格的基础；
    （3）进一步发展农业，以便我国能在最短期间为人民出产丰富的粮食并为轻工业出产丰富的原料。保证绝对完成农业方面的主要任务——竭力增加一切农作物的收获量，增加牲畜的数目，同时提高其产品生产率，增加农产品和畜产品的总产量和商品产量。改进农业机器站和国营农场的工作。提高集体农庄的劳动生产率，进一步加强集体农庄庄员的公有经济，增加它们的财富，并在这个基础上保证进一步提高集体农庄庄员的物质福利；

    （5）进一步发展先进的苏维埃科学，使它在世界上居第一位。（鼓掌）使科学家集中力量更加迅速地解决有关利用我国的极其丰富的天然资源的科学问题。加强科学和生产之间的创造性的合作，因为这是用实际经验来丰富科学，同时可以帮助实际工作人员更快地解决他们所碰到的问题；
    （6）竭力发展我们祖国的劳动人民的创造性，更广泛地开展社会主义竞赛运动，不懈地关心使社会主义建设各部门出现愈来愈多的用新方式组织劳动的积极模范榜样，在全体劳动人民中间不断推广这些模范工作的榜样，以便使我们社会的先进的工作人员的榜样，被愈来愈多地在劳动战线上工作的人员所效法；
    （7）进一步增进我国人民的物质福利；不断增加工人和职员的实际工资，改善劳动人民的居住条件；以一切方法协助增加农民的收入。发展苏维埃文化；改善人民教育和保健工作；经常注意进一步发展苏维埃文学与艺术；
