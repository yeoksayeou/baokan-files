    Experiences in Reforming Judicial Work in Anhui Province and Southern Jiangsu Region
    By our reporter Lin Hong
    The judicial reform work in Anhui Province and the Southern Jiangsu Region has basically concluded, and is about to transition to the construction phase after clearing up backlog cases. The majority of the People's Courts in these two regions have correctly implemented the policy of combining organizational rectification with ideological reform, and adopted the method of extensively mobilizing the masses from within and without. This has fundamentally achieved the goal of purifying the people's judicial organs. Judicial personnel have generally and preliminarily distinguished the principled boundaries between the new and old laws, strengthened the connection between the masses and the People's Courts, and established the prestige of the People's Courts among the masses.

    The reason why the judicial reform work in Anhui Province and the Southern Jiangsu Region has achieved great success in a relatively short period is primarily because the responsible comrades of the Party and the People's Government attached great importance to this work. They assigned specific personnel to regularly monitor the progress of the work, provided timely instructions on policies and guidelines, and promptly transferred a group of stronger cadres to participate in the work of the People's Courts before and after the start of this work. These measures ensured that the higher-level leading organs could timely discover the advantages and disadvantages in the work, and that the People's Courts, which were originally relatively weak, had a strong leadership core, guaranteeing the smooth progress of the judicial reform work.

    Secondly, it unified the understanding of judicial reform, and mobilized internal personnel to conduct self-examinations and mutual exposure and accusation. At the beginning of the judicial reform work in these two regions, some leaders and general judicial personnel of the People's Courts lacked a correct and comprehensive understanding of this work. Some leaders of the People's Courts regarded judicial reform as a simple organizational rectification, and neglected the ideological reform to oppose the old legal viewpoints. Some believed that there were not many old personnel in their courts, or that organizational rectification and personnel handling had already been carried out after the "Three-Anti" campaign, and felt that there were no major problems. Many old cadres believed that they had been tested by the revolution and that there were no major problems, holding the mistaken idea of only rectifying the old judicial personnel. General new cadres believed that they had not studied old laws or worked in old judicial organs, and had nothing to rectify. Old judicial personnel had negative thoughts or resistance emotions of "waiting to be rectified" and fearing unemployment and legal punishment. The above-mentioned various erroneous thoughts and emotions hindered the development of the judicial reform work. The Party and government leading organs in Anhui Province and the Southern Jiangsu Region, based on these situations, focused on correcting everyone's understanding of the judicial reform work in the early stage. The Southern Jiangsu Region held another conference of mayors and county People's Court presidents in mid-July, emphasizing that People's Courts at all levels should first do a good job in ideological mobilization, repeatedly explaining the importance, principles, and policies of the judicial reform work to everyone, and organizing everyone to study relevant documents. In particular, the heads of the People's Courts should take the lead in making self-criticisms, enlightening, and promoting general staff. The Anhui Provincial People's Court promptly reported and criticized various erroneous thoughts and practices, and the Party and government leading organs of several special districts also specially convened meetings to re-study the steps and methods for carrying out judicial reform work; or concentrated all the judicial cadres of the entire special district for study and self-criticism, with the Party and government负责人负责人作启发动员报告 and the presidents of the special district sub-courts making self-criticisms. The People's Courts at all levels in the two regions took these correct measures, quickly overcoming various erroneous and negative thoughts and emotions; then, in connection with the mobilization reports and various documents, they began to conduct universal self-examinations and mutual exposure and accusation. These measures quickly exposed many serious facts of violating laws and discipline, engaging in corruption and perverting justice, and various reactionary old legal thoughts and old judicial styles. For example, Zhang Wenzhi, a judge of the Jiangning County People's Court in the Southern Jiangsu Region, stole the materials of a counter-revolutionary element with six lives of blood debts, and privately changed the sentence of the criminal to five years in prison. Lu Qi, a trial worker of the Suzhou Municipal People's Court, scolded workers when handling a labor dispute case, saying, "You have eaten the boss's food for more than ten years, and even a dog wags its tail, you are not even as good as a dog." These serious situations made the leaders and general staff of the People's Courts in various places deeply realize the necessity of judicial reform, further overcome the paralyzing complacency of the new and old cadres, and made them determined to actively participate in the judicial reform work and earnestly transform themselves. General old judicial personnel also began to realize the serious errors in their thoughts and styles, and felt that they were not worthy of doing people's judicial work if they did not thoroughly transform themselves. In addition, the heads of the People's Courts repeatedly explained the policies of judicial reform, which prompted the general old judicial personnel to expose the problems in their thoughts and styles. In this way, the judicial reform work formed a mass movement within the courts.

    Furthermore, in addition to mobilizing all personnel within the courts to act together, Anhui Province and the Southern Jiangsu Region also widely publicized the significance of judicial reform to the masses, deeply mobilizing the masses to expose and accuse, and put forward suggestions for improving judicial work. In addition to convening various mass meetings according to regions and organizational systems, another effective method was to seize typical events in misjudged cases during the movement and hold mass rallies to publicly announce the results of the retrial. This approach effectively stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in judicial reform and encouraged the masses to participate in various meetings and the interest and courage to make suggestions to the People's Courts. According to incomplete statistics, the People's Courts at all levels in Anhui Province held a total of 435 various sizes of forums, small mass meetings, and democratic inspection meetings, with more than 188,000 people participating, including grassroots cadres, Party and League members, activists from streets and villages, litigants, and representatives of mass organizations such as workers, peasants, youth, and women, basically achieving the goal of universally and deeply mobilizing the masses. The masses put forward a total of 2,628 suggestions on judicial staff's corruption, malpractice, infringement of human rights, misjudgment of cases, and improvement of judicial work. Fifteen cities and counties in the Southern Jiangsu Region also universally convened similar mass meetings at the end of July and the beginning of August, collecting 698 various opinions. The opinions put forward by the masses fully exposed the problems existing in the People's Courts at all levels in Anhui Province and the Southern Jiangsu Region. After studying and verifying these opinions and materials, the responsible cadres of the People's Courts, according to the principle of combining punishment and education, seriously and impartially handled those personnel who violated laws and dereliction of duty and who had serious old legal thoughts and old judicial styles. Except for a few bad elements with heinous crimes who were arrested and brought to justice, the majority were either transferred or given training.

    The People's Courts in Anhui Province and the Southern Jiangsu Region have mostly carried out judicial reform work in accordance with the above-mentioned principles and steps, and have achieved great success. First, it fully exposed the serious facts of certain bad elements in the people's judicial organs violating laws and discipline, engaging in corruption and perverting justice, and extortion, forcing a very small number of old judicial personnel who committed heinous crimes and refused to confess their crimes to lower their heads and confess their crimes; at the same time, it also exposed and criticized various reactionary old legal thoughts and old judicial styles, enabling general judicial personnel to preliminarily draw a clear line between the people's judicial work and the reactionary judicial work, and determined to continue to transform and improve themselves in future work. Second, the masses put forward many active and constructive suggestions to the People's Courts, such as judicial work must implement the mass line, the People's Courts should set up inquiry, writing, and people's reception rooms, do not delay handling cases, allow oral complaints, thoroughly correct the old legal viewpoints and the old yamen style, and the old trial system. These suggestions are of great help in improving judicial work. Third, it educated the broad masses, further enabling them to see clearly the fundamental difference between the People's Courts and the courts of the reactionary ruling class, recognize that the People's Courts are the people's own courts, and begin to establish close relationships with the People's Courts. The masses in various places said that in the past, when they walked to the gate of the pseudo-court, they did not dare to take a look; today, the People's Government has mobilized the masses to make suggestions to the court, which is unprecedented. The broad masses warmly support judicial reform, and many people have also expressed that they will assist the People's Courts in doing a good job in trial work in the future, and some have already begun to do so.

    安徽省和苏南区改革司法工作的经验
    本报记者  林洪
    安徽省和苏南区的司法改革工作已基本结束，即将经过清理积案，转入建设阶段。这两个地区的大多数人民法院，都正确地执行了组织整顿和思想改造相结合的方针，采取了由内到外广泛发动群众的办法，基本上达到了纯洁人民司法机关的目的，司法工作人员一般地初步划清了新旧法律的原则界限，密切了群众和人民法院的联系，树立了人民法院在群众中的威信。
    安徽省和苏南区的司法改革工作所以能在较短的时间内取得较大的成绩，首先是由于党和人民政府的负责同志十分重视这一工作。他们曾确定专人经常掌握工作进行的情况，及时地给与方针政策的指示，并在这一工作开始前后及时地抽调了一批较强的干部参加了人民法院的工作。这些措施，使上级领导机关能够及时发现工作中的优点缺点，使原来工作比较弱的人民法院有了坚强的领导核心，保证了司法改革工作的顺利进行。
    其次，是统一对司法改革的认识，发动内部人员自我检查，互相检举揭发。这两个地区司法改革工作开始的时候，部分人民法院的领导人和一般司法工作人员对这一工作缺乏正确的全面的认识。有些人民法院的领导人把司法改革看成简单的组织整顿，忽视了反对旧法观点的思想改造工作。有些则认为本院的旧人员不多，或者是“三反”后已作了组织的整顿和人员的处理，觉得没有什么大问题。许多老干部认为自己经过革命考验，问题不大，抱着专整旧司法人员的错误想法。一般新干部认为自己没有学过旧法或没有在旧司法机关作过事，也没有什么可整的。旧司法人员则存在着“等待挨整”和怕失业怕法办的消极思想或抵抗情绪。上述种种错误的思想和情绪，阻碍了司法改革工作的开展。安徽省和苏南区的党政领导机关根据这些情况，在初期着重端正大家对司法改革工作的认识。苏南区于七月中旬再次召开了市、县人民法院院长会议，强调各级人民法院应首先作好思想动员工作，反复地向大家讲明司法改革工作的重要性和方针、政策，组织大家学习有关的文件。特别是要由人民法院的负责人带头作检讨、启发和推动一般工作人员。安徽省人民法院及时地通报批判了各种错误的思想和作法，几个专区的党政领导机关也专门召开了会议，重新研究了开展司法改革工作的步骤和方法；或者把全专区的司法干部集中起来学习、检讨，由专区的党政负责人作启发动员报告、专区分院的院长作检讨。两个地区各级人民法院采取这些正确的措施，迅速克服了各种错误的消极的思想情绪；然后联系动员报告和各种文件，开始进行普遍的自我检查和互相检举揭发。这些措施，使许多严重的违法乱纪、贪赃枉法的事实和各种反动的旧法思想、旧司法作风迅速暴露出来。如苏南区江宁县人民法院审判员张文智，把一个有六条人命的血债的反革命分子的材料偷出来，私自改判该犯五年徒刑。苏州市人民法院审判工作人员陆琪处理劳资纠纷案时，辱骂工人说：“你吃了老板十几年的饭，养狗还摇摇尾巴，你连狗都不如。”这些严重的情况，使各地人民法院的领导人和一般工作人员深刻地认识了司法改革的必要，进一步克服了新老干部的麻痹自满情绪，使他们决心积极参加司法改革工作，认真改造自己。一般旧司法人员，也开始认识到自己思想作风上的严重错误，感觉到自己如不彻底改造，即不配作人民司法工作。加上人民法院的负责人三番五次地说明司法改革的政策，便推动了一般旧司法人员暴露自己思想作风上的问题。这样，司法改革工作就在法院内部形成了群众性的运动。
    再次，安徽省和苏南区除在法院内部发动一切人员共同行动以外，还广泛地向群众宣传司法改革工作的意义，深入发动群众起来检举揭发，并提出改进司法工作的意见。发动群众的方法，除按地区和组织系统召开各种群众会议外，另一有效的方法是在运动进行期间，抓住错判案件中的典型事件，召开群众大会，公开宣布改判结果。这种作法有力地激发了群众参加司法改革的热情，鼓舞了群众参加各种会议和向人民法院提意见的兴趣和勇气。根据不完全的统计，安徽省各级人民法院共召开各种大小座谈会、小型群众会和民主检查大会四百三十五次，有十八万八千多人参加，其中有基层干部、党团员、街道和乡村的积极分子、诉讼当事人和工、农、青、妇等群众团体的代表，基本上做到了普遍深入地发动群众。群众共提出司法工作人员贪污，舞弊、侵犯人权、错判案件和改进司法工作的各种意见二千六百二十八条。苏南区十五个市、县人民法院，也在七月底和八月初普遍召开了同样的群众会议，收集到各种意见六百九十八件。群众所提出的这些意见，充分暴露了安徽省和苏南区各级人民法院存在的问题。人民法院的负责干部把这些意见和材料研究对证后，根据惩办和教育相结合的方针，严肃公正地处理了那些违法失职和有严重旧法思想、旧司法作风的人员。除少数罪大恶极的坏分子逮捕法办外    ，大多数的人都分别介绍他们转业，或给以训练。
    安徽省和苏南区的人民法院，大多数都按照上述的方针和步骤进行了司法改革工作，收到了很大的成绩。第一、充分暴露了人民司法机关中某些坏分子违法乱纪、贪赃枉法、敲诈勒索的严重事实，使极少数罪恶重大而又不肯认罪的旧司法人员不得不低头认罪；同时也揭发批判了各种反动的旧法思想和旧司法作风，使一般司法工作人员初步划清了人民的司法工作和反动的司法工作的原则界限，决心在今后的工作中继续改造和提高自己。第二、群众向人民法院提出了许多积极的建设性的意见，如司法工作必须贯彻群众路线，人民法院应设立问事、代书、人民接待室，办案不要拖延，准用口头申诉等，彻底纠正旧法观点与旧衙门作风、旧审判制度。这些意见对于改进司法工作有很大帮助。第三、教育了广大的群众，使他们进一步看清了人民法院和反动统治阶级法院的根本区别，认识了人民法院是人民自己的法院，开始和人民法院建立了密切的关系。各地群众说，过去走到伪法院的门口，连看都不敢多看一下；今天人民政府发动群众向法院提意见，这是从古未有的事。广大群众热烈拥护司法改革，许多人还表示今后要协助人民法院作好审判工作，有的已在开始这样做。
