    Gao Xiu's Youth Shines with Glory
    Ma Tianqi
    I. A Humble Attitude
    From a simple letter of introduction and a conversation with her, I learned her resume:
    Gao Xiu, eighteen years old, member of the Communist Youth League, of student origin. Joined the Chinese People's Volunteers in the winter of 1950. Not long ago, she returned to China for recuperation due to illness. Because her health was no longer suitable for work at the front, the Party, in order to cultivate her, approved her application to the Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Middle School.
    When I realized that this most beloved person would become my student, I naturally felt proud. However, as I was about to tell the teaching cadre to issue her an "admission ticket," I discovered a problem.
    According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education: all students applying to the Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Middle School must be of worker or peasant origin, and must have more than three years of working experience.
    Gao Xiu's military service was insufficient.
    How could this be? I felt that this was a principled issue that needed to be considered. I told her:
    "Whether you can participate in the entrance examination or not, I can only notify you before noon tomorrow, because your military service is one year short."
    She said nothing, gave a military salute, and left.
    The next day, after the comrades of the preferential treatment office introduced her again and after repeated review of her materials, we came to the conclusion that: the "admission ticket" could be issued completely, because she was a meritorious person of the people, created many heroic deeds on the Korean battlefield, and was an orphan herself, whose father died in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Why didn't she mention these things, or fill them in on the registration form? In a conversation to decide whether to admit her, she spoke her mind:
    "I am a volunteer soldier, of course I should do some work. I feel that I have done very little, and there is nothing to say."
    Her humble attitude, and her high degree of enthusiasm for the revolution, deeply moved me.
    II. "She can do it!"
    Gradually, I learned about this young girl's heroic deeds in and out of the hail of bullets.
    When sixteen-year-old Gao Xiu first joined the Volunteer Army, many comrades expressed doubt about her: "Can she do it?"
    However, for two years, whether in the scorching summer or the winter with snow up to her knees, on treacherous mountain roads or muddy fields, sometimes in order to complete an urgent task, she had to march more than a hundred li in one night. Not only did she never lag behind, but she often rushed to help weak comrades carry their guns and baggage. Except for the occasional collective ride, she never agreed to sit in the car as long as someone was walking on the ground. During rest, the comrades asked her:
    "Little devil, aren't you tired?"
    Her answer was:
    "Not tired in spirit!"
    Yes, her spirit was always cheerful. People never heard her say she was tired. She said: "Although the long march makes my legs feel like they are about to break and my back aches, when I think that my personal hard work can be exchanged for the happy life of the people of the motherland, I forget everything, and all I feel is glory!"
    "She can do it!" No one doubted her anymore.
    III. Capturing Five Secret Agents Alive
    Gao Xiu was transferred to work in a field hospital in a certain place. One day, a truckload of wounded soldiers was pulled down from the front line. Among them was a man named Chen Jiyong, who, according to himself, was allowed to rest in the rear hospital because he had typhoid fever and many years of chronic illness.
    Twenty days later, Chen Jiyong's illness suddenly improved. He asked to stay in the hospital to do cooking work. At that time, the hospital was short of cooks, and Chen Jiyong stayed.
    After joining the food squad, he behaved very actively. In the morning, before others got up, he went to the kitchen to work first. At night, when others were resting, he often stayed in the kitchen. Sometimes he put on his clothes and went outside in the middle of the night, and it took a long time to come back. At the life meeting, the opinions he gave to others were very sharp. These facts aroused the suspicion of Gao Xiu and Zhang Shikui: "Why does a newly arrived comrade from outside have such a performance?"
    This field hospital was originally hidden in the deep mountains and forests, and it was not easy for enemy planes to detect it. However, since Chen Jiyong came here, enemy planes have come here several times to bomb and strafe, and several wounded soldiers and a nurse have been injured. Gao Xiu and Zhang Shikui, the head of the food squad, continuously reported Chen Jiyong's situation since he came here to the political instructor, and secretly paid attention to him.
    One day, it was a clear night after rain. The moon was bright and the stars were sparse, and the mountains were exceptionally quiet. Gao Xiu was performing her duty as a mobile sentry. She paid close attention to every shadow and every dark corner. Suddenly, on the right side of the hospital's central ward, under an old tree, two bright and dazzling signal flares rose. Gao Xiu vigilantly tracked over and fired two shots at the base of the tree. A dark shadow flickered slightly to the left side of the ward and disappeared. Then she heard the ward door响微微响了一下. At this time, Gao Xiu completely understood that the secret agent must be in this ward. When she pushed open the ward door and walked into the room, all the wounded and sick were sleeping soundly, only Chen Jiyong was wearing clothes and was just about to get into the quilt. The facts before her eyes were ironclad proof. Gao Xiu immediately reported the situation to her superiors.
    A sentry was added to the ward door.
    The next day, everyone was given a card, and the regiment headquarters ordered a military registration.
    Others quickly filled out the cards, only he—Chen Jiyong—hesitated there. For a while, he wrote his place of origin as Shanghai, and then changed it to Shandong. He wrote and crossed it out, crossed it out and wrote again, his face pale and his wrist trembling.
    Finally, after the company instructor and regimental political commissars talked to him, and after extensive investigation and research, the problem was clarified:
    Chen Jiyong, twenty-four years old, was the leader of a team of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents dropped by the U.S. military, and his team had five people. He started doing secret agent work at the age of fourteen, and had been doing it for ten years now.
    He confessed some materials and summoned the other four secret agents, who were arrested on the spot.
    In addition to the signal gun and signal flares, which were placed in a cave under a bluestone next to the poplar tree behind the ward, he also carried a package of four ounces of poison, intending to seize the opportunity to put it in the drinking water or soup to "wipe out" all the wounded, sick, and staff in this area!
    The situation was so dangerous! In this incident, Gao Xiu fully demonstrated the noble quality of the high degree of vigilance of revolutionary soldiers. In addition to commending Gao Xiu and Zhang Shikui, the head of the food squad, the regiment headquarters awarded Gao Xiu a major merit.
    IV. Rescuing the Wounded in the Fire Net
    Last August, Gao Xiu worked as a nurse in a field hospital in the mountains of a certain place. Some of the wounded and sick were placed in cave dwellings on the mountainside, and a few were placed in the homes of Korean civilians.
    One night, enemy planes, in a large formation of forty-two aircraft, took turns strafing and bombing the hospital. The wounded soldiers living in the solid cave dwellings were safe. Many people were playing self-made cards and huqin all the time. However, nineteen seriously wounded soldiers lived in the homes of ordinary people, and the houses were hit and caught fire. Nineteen comrades were about to sacrifice inside. At this time, Gao Xiu thought: these nineteen comrades are all outstanding children of the Chinese nation, can we just watch them being burned to death inside? No, absolutely not! After asking for organizational approval, she held her head in her hands and used every gap in the enemy's strafing to roll down the mountain from a height of several zhang. Shrapnel and bullets whistled around her, her hands, feet, and clothes were torn, but she finally rolled to the foot of the mountain. She quickly ran to the ward and rescued the wounded from the smoke without hesitation. When she had just rescued the nineteenth seriously wounded soldier and was less than a zhang away from the door, with a "boom," all four thatched houses collapsed.
    After arranging the last wounded soldier who had been rescued, she saw another house three li away—which was also our ward—also burning due to enemy strafing. She thought: the wounded soldiers inside also need to be rescued! She ran there, tripped over a stone halfway, and just as she got up and was about to move forward again, she found that her right leg and abdomen were injured, her trousers and jacket were torn to shreds by shrapnel, and bright red plasma was flowing from the wound.
    Half a month later, before the wound had healed, she took the initiative to start working again. Because of her heroic spirit of self-sacrifice and revolutionary heroism, the lives of nineteen wounded soldiers were saved. After these wounded soldiers were discharged from the hospital, they all presented flowers to her and asked the organization to award her a major merit.
    Due to overwork and excessive nervous tension, she unfortunately contracted a women's disease.
    V. "Let me resist the U.S. and aid Korea to the end!"
    After she contracted a women's disease, the organization wanted her to return to China for recuperation or study, but she said: "Please allow me to resist the U.S. and aid Korea to the end! Please allow me to fulfill my oath before going abroad! Look! The Korean people are being burned, killed, raped, and plundered by the American devils, they have nothing to eat, nothing to live in, and they are suffering so much! If this group of wolves crosses the Yalu River, wouldn't our experience be the same as the Korean people?"
    Repeated pleas finally made it difficult for the organization to insist on ordering her to return to China. However, the organization considered that her work could not be properly taken care of.
    One rainy midnight, a group of wounded soldiers were transported from Pyongyang, Yangde and other places, and the car stopped on the highway three and a half miles away from the hospital. The order from the superiors was: to carry all the wounded soldiers to the hospital before dawn, the task was so urgent and serious.
    For two months, it had been raining continuously, and the air-raid shelters were never dry all day long. The mountain road was muddy and rugged, and every round trip took a lot of effort.
    At that time, the order from the hospital organization was: except for Gao Xiu, who stayed in the hospital to take care of the wounded, everyone else was mobilized. Before departure, the organization solemnly said to her: "You are the youngest in our hospital, and you are responsible for taking care of all the wounded soldiers. Do you know the importance of this responsibility? You must not only serve them with medicine and injections, even serve them with their bowel movements and urination, but also be vigilant against bad people!"
    When accepting this task, she knew that it was impossible for her to make a contrary request; but she knew very well in her heart: this was to take care of her health.
    After properly settling the wounded and sick in the ward, the rain became heavier and heavier, and the wind blew harder and harder. She thought: letting the wounded and sick suffer from the wind and rain outside for a moment would increase their pain for a moment; if one more person could help carry them, the pain of the wounded and sick could be reduced. She felt uneasy about the organization's care for her in this emergency. She finally decided: go! Must go! Go carry the wounded soldiers with them!
    After she explained her meaning to the wounded and sick comrades in the hospital, many wounded soldiers were moved to tears. They said: "Little Gao, you are so good! Go ahead, we will take care of ourselves."
    The task was completed before dawn. She carried down seven wounded soldiers and carried down five wounded soldiers. Each round trip from the highway to the cave was seven li. When she couldn't carry them anymore, she lay on the road, and then let the wounded soldiers lie on her back and crawl forward step by step. The wounded soldiers said: "Our little Gao is rolling around like a mud ball."
    The next day, the organization asked her to rest. But she thought: there are few people and many things, and one person has to do the work of several people, how can she rest at ease. She quietly went to get food for the wounded soldiers again. When she was carrying the fifth bucket of rice, she suddenly fainted in the muddy pond beside the road. She was ill, and the illness was once very serious. The regimental political commissar ordered four military doctors to rush to the rescue. The examination results all considered the condition dangerous and urgently needed a blood transfusion. At that time, the dean, company commander, nurses, cooks, and others gave her more than 1,000 cc of blood and gave her many emergency injections. The four military doctors took turns guarding her for four days and four nights before she woke up. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief and said, "Little devil, you scared us to death!"
    Afterwards, the company commander was severely criticized by the regimental commander: "Why use cadres like this!" And it was decided again that she should return to China for recuperation. But this time, she did not return to China again. She promised that she would not do work that she could not do in the future.
    In December of the same year, she worked with male comrades to dig mountain caves and became ill again.
    This time, the regimental political commissar brought her to him and asked her seriously:
    "Are you a revolutionary soldier?"
    "Yes, I am a revolutionary soldier."
    "How should a revolutionary soldier be?"
    "Obey orders and listen to commands!"
    "Okay, on behalf of the organization, I order you to return to China to participate in study and recuperate."
    The regimental political commissar handled her problem in such a simple but decisive manner.
    "Let me resist the U.S. and aid Korea to the end!" These words climbed to her lips several times, and then she swallowed them back several times, because she knew that this time the regimental political commissar would not agree to her.

    高秀的青春闪耀着光辉
    马天启
    一、谦虚的态度
    从一封简单的介绍信和她本人的一段谈话里，我知道了她的简历：
    高秀，十八岁，青年团员，学生出身。一九五○年冬天参加中国人民志愿军。不久以前，因病回国休养。因身体不再适于前方工作，党为了培养她，批准她投考工农速成中学。
    当我意识到这最可爱的人将成为我的学生的时候，我自然地产生了一种骄傲的心情。但是，在我将要告诉教导干事发给她“准考证”的时候，我发现了一个问题。
    按照教育部的规定：凡投考工农速成中学的学员，本人或家庭必须是工农成分，且须具有三年以上的工龄。
    高秀的军龄不足。
    这怎么能行呢？我感到这是一个带有原则性的需要考虑的问题。我告诉她说：
    “你是否可以参加入学考试，明天午前才能通知你，因为你的军龄差一年。”
    她没有说什么，行了个军礼，走了。
    次日，经过优抚处同志再次介绍和对于她的材料的反复审查，我们得出的结论是：完全可以发给“准考证”，因为她是人民的功臣，在朝鲜战场上创造了许多英雄事迹，本人是个孤儿，父亲是在抗日战争中牺牲的。这些，她为什么不讲出来，或者填写在登记表上呢？在决定录取她的一次谈话中，她才说出了她的思想：
    “我是一个志愿军，当然要做一点工作。我觉得我做得很少，没有什么可说的。”
    谦虚的态度，对于革命的高度的热情，深深地感动了我。
    二、“她能行呀！”
    渐渐地，我知道了这个年轻的女孩子出入在枪林弹雨中的英雄事迹。
    十六岁的高秀刚参加志愿军的时候，不少同志对她表示怀疑：“她能行呀？”
    但是，二年来，无论是在炙热的盛夏或雪深没膝的严冬，在险峻的山路上或泥泞的田野里，有时为了完成一个紧急任务，一宿要行军一百里以上，她不但没有一次掉队，而且还经常抢着帮助体弱的同志背枪、背行囊。除掉有时集体乘车外，只要是有人在地下走，她自己从不肯坐车。在休息的时候，同志们问她：
    “小鬼，不累吗？”
    她的回答是：
    “精神上不累！”
    是的，她的精神永远是愉快的。人们从来没有听到她说过疲劳。她说：“虽然长途行军，腿快要累折了，腰酸痛得要命；但是当我想到个人的劳苦，可以换得祖国人民的幸福生活的时候，我什么都忘了，我感到的只是光荣！”
    “她能行呀！”再没有谁对她表示怀疑了。
    三、活捉五个特务
    高秀调到了某地野战医院工作。一天，从前沿阵地拉下来一汽车伤员。其中有一名叫做陈继勇的，据本人谈，他是由于患伤寒病，加以有多年宿疾，所以组织上才让他到后方医院休养的。
    二十天以后，陈继勇的病忽然好了。他要求留在医院里做炊事工作。当时医院正缺少炊事员，陈继勇留下来了。
    他在参加伙食班工作以后，表现得特别积极。早晨在别人没有起来的时候，他首先到厨下去工作。晚上，别人都休息了，他往往还留在厨下。有时他夜半穿上衣服到外面去，许久时间才回来。在生活会上，他给别人提的意见，都是十分尖刻的。这些事实引起了高秀和张世奎的怀疑：“一个新到的外来同志，为什么会有这样的表现呢？”
    这个野战医院原是隐蔽在山深林茂处，不容易被敌机发觉的。但是从陈继勇来了以后，敌机曾数次到这里来轰炸和扫射，前后有几名伤员和一名护士受伤。高秀和伙食班长张世奎把陈继勇到这里以后的各种情况不断地报告政治指导员，同时暗暗地留心他。
    一天，雨过天晴的夜半时候。月明星稀，山地里显得分外寂静。高秀正执行着游动哨的职务。她对于每一个影子，每一个阴暗的角落，都是十分留心的。蓦地，在医院中心区病房的右侧，一株老树的下面，升起了两颗鲜艳夺目的信号弹。高秀机警地追踪过去，向树下打了两枪。一个黑影向病房的左侧略一闪动，便不见了。随后听到病房门微微地响了一下。这时候，高秀便完全明白了，知道特务准在这病房里。当她推开病房门走向屋里看时，全体伤病员都在熟睡，只有陈继勇穿着衣服刚刚要向被子里钻。眼前的事实铁一样地被证实了。高秀马上把情况报告了上级。
    病房门口加了岗哨。
    第二天，每人发给了一张卡片，团部命令举行军人登记。
    别人都很快地写好卡片，只有他——陈继勇，在那里踌躇。一会儿把原籍写成上海，一会儿又改成山东，写了涂掉，涂掉了再写，脸上苍白，腕子在发颤。
    最后，经过连指导员、团政委们和他谈话，并经过多方调查研究，问题弄清楚了：
    陈继勇，二十四岁，是美军空投蒋记特务的小组长，他的小组有五个人。他十四岁就开始做特务工作，到现在已经干了十年了。
    他供出了若干材料，把其余四名特务也召集来了，当场被我们逮捕。
    他随身所带，除信号枪和信号弹是放在病房后面杨树旁一块青石下面的洞穴里外，还有一包四两重的毒药，准备遇有机会投到饮水或菜汤里去，把这地区的全体伤病员、工作人员“一网打尽”！
    情况就是这样危险！在这个事件中，高秀充分地发挥了革命军人高度的警惕性的这一高贵品质。团部除对高秀和伙食班长张世奎通报表扬外，并给高秀记大功一次。
    四、火网里抢救伤员
    去年八月，高秀在某地山地里的一个野战医院里当护士。伤病员们有的是被安置在山腰上的窑洞里，也有少数是安置在朝鲜老百姓的家里。
    一天夜里，敌机以四十二架的大编队，对医院轮流地进行扫射和轰炸。住在坚固的窑洞里的伤员是安全的。有许多人一直在玩着自制的扑克、胡琴。但是，有十九名重伤员住在老百姓家里，房子被打着了，失火了，十九位同志眼看就要牺牲在里边。这时候，高秀想：这十九名同志，都是中华民族的优秀儿女，能够眼看着他们被烧死在里面吗？不能，绝对不能！她在请示组织批准后，她用两手抱住头，利用敌机扫射的每一间隙，从数丈的高处，向山脚滚下来，弹片和枪弹在她周围呼啸着，她的手、脚、衣服被划破了，但是她终于滚到了山脚下。她迅速地跑向病房，毫不犹豫地从烟火中抢救伤员。当她在刚刚把第十九名重伤员抢救出来，离开房门还没有一丈远的时候，“呼隆”一声，四间草房都坍塌下去了。
    在把抢救出来的最后一名伤员安置好了的时候，她望见距离这里有三里路远的另外一座民房——也是我们的病房，同样是由于敌机扫射烧着了。她想：那里面的伤员同样需要抢救的呀！她迳向那里飞跑了去，半途被一块石子绊倒了，在刚刚爬起，待要再次前进的瞬间，她发现自己的右腿和腹部负伤了，裤筒和上衣，被弹片撕得粉碎，殷红的血浆，从伤口流了出来。
    半月后，伤口还没有封严，她又主动地开始工作了。由于她这种英勇的自我牺牲精神和革命英雄主义，保全了十九名伤员的生命。这批伤员出院后，都纷纷献花给她，并要求组织上给她记大功一次。
    由于过度疲劳和神经的过度紧张，她不幸地染上了妇女病。
    五、“让我抗美援朝到底吧！”
    在她染上妇女病以后，组织上要她回国休养或学习，但是她说：“请允许我抗美援朝到底吧！请允许我完成出国前的誓语吧！看！朝鲜老百姓被美国鬼子烧杀奸淫，没吃的，没住的，折磨得多苦啊！这群恶狼如果窜过鸭绿江去，我们的遭遇，不是会和朝鲜老百姓一样了吗？”
    再三的恳求，终于使组织上不好再坚持地命令她回国。但是，组织上对于她的工作，却考虑到不能不做适当的照顾了。
    一个雨天的半夜，从平壤、阳德等地运来一批伤员，汽车停在离医院三里半路的公路上。上级的命令是：要在破晓前，把全部伤员抬到医院里去，任务是如此紧急而且严重。
    两个月来，大雨连绵，防空洞里整天都没有干爽的时候。山路泥泞而又崎岖，每一往返，都要花费很大的力气。
    当时，院部组织上的命令是：除高秀一人留在医院里照顾伤员外，全部出动。出发前，组织上郑重地对她说：“咱这个医院里你最小，全部伤员要你一个照顾，你知道责任的重大吗？你不仅要伺候他们敷药、注射，甚至伺候他们大、小便，而且还要警惕坏人破坏！”
    在接受这个任务的时候，她知道是不容她提出相反的要求的；但是她心里雪亮：这是为了照顾她的身体。
    在很好地安顿了病房里的伤病员以后，雨越落越大了，风越吹越紧了，她想：让伤病员们在外面多受一时的风吹雨淋，就多加重他们一时的痛苦；如果能多一个人帮助抬运，就可以减少伤病员们的一部分痛苦。她对于组织上在这种紧急情况下对于自己的照顾，感到不安。她终于决定了：去！一定要去！和他们一起抬运伤员去！
    在她把自己的意思对医院里的伤员同志们讲清了以后，好些伤员被感动得落泪了。他们说：“小高，你太好了！你去吧，我们会照顾自己的。”
    天亮前，任务完成了。她背下来了七名伤员，抬下来了五名伤员。从公路到山洞，每一往返是七华里。在背不动的时候，她就躺在路上，再让伤员躺在自己背上，一步一步地向前爬。伤病员们说：“我们的小高，滚得像个泥球了。”
    次日，组织上要她休息。但是她想：人少事多，一个人要做好几个人的工作，怎么能够安心休息呢。她悄悄地又给伤员们打饭。当她挑到第五桶饭的时候，忽然晕倒在路旁泥塘里。她病了，病势一度很严重。团政委命四名军医前来急救。诊察结果，都认为病情危险，急需输血。当时由院长、连长、护士、炊事员们，给她输了一千西西以上的血，打了许多急救针，四名军医轮流着看守了四天四宿，才苏醒了过来。大家才算舒了一口气，都说：“小鬼，你可把我们吓坏了！”
    事后，连长受到了团长的严厉批评：“为什么要这样使用干部呢！”并再次决定她回国休养。但是这一次，她又没有回国。她保证今后不再做自己力不胜任的工作。
    同年十二月，她和男同志在一起挖山洞，又累病了。
    这次，团政委把她找了去，严肃地问她：
    “你是不是革命军人？”
    “是革命军人。”
    “革命军人应该怎样？”
    “服从命令，听从指挥！”
    “好，我代表组织，命令你回国参加学习，休养身体。”
    团政委就是这样简单地，但是是果断地，处理了她的问题。
    “让我抗美援朝到底吧！”这话几次地爬到她的口边，又几次地吞了回去，因为她知道这一次团政委是不会答应她的了。
