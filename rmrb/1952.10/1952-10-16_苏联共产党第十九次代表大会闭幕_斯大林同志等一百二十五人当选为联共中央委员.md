Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 15th. TASS reports: The final session of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was held on October 14th in the Grand Kremlin Palace.

At 9:00 PM, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin and his closest comrades Molotov, Malenkov, Voroshilov, Bulganin, Beria, Kaganovich, Khrushchev, Andreyev, Mikoyan, Kosygin, Shvernik and other members of the Presidium of the Congress appeared on the stage. Delegates and guests welcomed them with stormy and prolonged applause. Everyone stood up. The hall resounded with cheers for J.V. Stalin. People cheered, "Glory to Comrade Stalin!", "Long live Comrade Stalin!", "Comrade Stalin, hurrah!". The fervent outburst of the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and representatives of foreign communist and workers' parties attending the Congress expressed sincere, boundless love and loyalty to the great leader, friend and mentor of the working people.

Chairman Voroshilov announced the opening of the meeting.

The Chairman asked delegate Kuznetsov to report on the election results of the central organs of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

One hundred and twenty-five people were elected as members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. When the name of J.V. Stalin was mentioned in the announced list of those elected, thunderous applause resounded in the hall again. Everyone stood up, and the cheers for J.V. Stalin were incessant. People cheered, "Long live Comrade Stalin!", "Comrade Stalin, hurrah!". Applause rang out in the hall when the names of J.V. Stalin's closest comrades were mentioned. One hundred and ten people were elected as alternate members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and thirty-seven people were elected as members of the Central Auditing Commission.

After the announcement of the election results of the Party's central organs, the representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Burma gave a congratulatory speech to the Congress, which was warmly welcomed by the audience. He said: Since the victory of the October Revolution, the Soviet land has become a beacon and hope for all oppressed nations in the world. The Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin stand at the forefront of the people fighting for peace and freedom, and therefore have won the love and respect of the people in all colonies and dependent countries.

The representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Burma spoke about the conspiracy of the American and British imperialists, who, in order to maintain feudal rule, are instigating and organizing bloody wars against the masses of the people in Burma. They are trying to turn Burma into a springboard for aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. He said: But the imperialists' conspiracy will not succeed, because the people of Burma, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have taken up arms and are fighting for their national independence, people's democracy and peace.

Then he read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Burma to the 19th Congress; the delegates responded with stormy and prolonged applause. Everyone stood up.

Next to speak was Morris, a member of the Executive Committee of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada. He was greeted with thunderous applause.

Morris said: To attend the Congress of the powerful Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to hear its achievements and great plans, to see the labor heroes and heroes of the Great Patriotic War around, and to personally see the construction of the communist society that mankind has long yearned for, is not only to see the future of the Soviet Union, but also to see the future of all other countries.

Morris said that no one in the world has pointed out the path to lasting peace, national freedom and people's democracy to suffering humanity as clearly as the great Joseph Stalin. No lying propaganda can stifle the Canadian people's ardent desire to know how the Soviet people live and the path they are taking. He said that we have a responsibility not to let the Canadian people be blinded by war propaganda and not to let them fall into the net of lies.

Morris continued, the Canadian people no longer need any record-breaking unemployment figures, rising prices and taxes, and no longer allow Canadian raw materials to supply the American war machine. What they want is close friendship and extensive trade with the Soviet Union, the People's Democracies, and People's China.

His speech was frequently interrupted by prolonged applause.

When Gopalan, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India, appeared on the podium, the audience applauded. He conveyed the warm, fraternal revolutionary greetings of all Indian communists and freedom-loving people of India to the Congress.

Gopalan said that the great achievements of the Soviet Union, People's China and the People's Democracies are in stark contrast to the situation in India: in India, famine and unemployment shroud everything, consumer goods prices continue to rise, taxes and expenditures for military and police affairs are increasing, and civil liberties are restricted.

Today, the people of India see more clearly than ever who their real friends are. It is the Soviet Union and People's China that are helping the famine-stricken people of India, while the American imperialists are sending moldy wheat and old cotton fabrics to India.

The people of India realize that the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union is a truly selfless friend. They see the growing strength of the camp of peace, freedom, democracy and socialism. At the same time, they also see very clearly everything that the imperialist camp can give them: increasing economic crises, a decline in living standards, unemployment, oppression, loss of national sovereignty, police rule and war.

The imperialists want to drag India into the war camp, but the Indian people will never allow it. They will resolutely resist all those who incite war. Gopalan said that we will strive to unite the Indian people with the Soviet Union, China, the People's Democracies and all peace-loving people to fight for lasting peace, freedom and democracy.

Finally, Gopalan cheered for the unity of the Indian and Soviet people, for the unity of all working people in the world, for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its great leader, J.V. Stalin, which aroused the stormy applause of the delegates and guests of the Congress.

After the representative of the Indian Communist Party finished speaking, he bowed to the audience first according to Eastern custom, then bowed to the Presidium, and finally left the podium amid applause. After a while, the whole audience was silent. The Chairman announced: "Comrade Stalin speaks."

The great leader stood up and walked steadily to the podium. At this moment, thunderous cheers shook the hall. Everyone stood up. Waves of "Hurrah" echoed off the walls of the Kremlin. Cheers in various languages ​​merged into one. Everything that fills the hearts of the Soviet people, everything that communists cherish most, poured out in this cheer expressing the Party's boundless love and loyalty to its leader. One minute, two minutes, three minutes... passed, and the cheers seemed like an avalanche, becoming more and more vigorous. Finally, because everyone was eager to hear Stalin's speech, the cheers stopped...

J.V. Stalin first thanked all the fraternal parties who sent representatives to the Congress or sent congratulatory telegrams to the Congress on behalf of the Congress. The great leader thanked them for their fraternal congratulations and for their trust, which showed their willingness to support our Party in fighting for a bright future for the people of all countries, fighting against war, and fighting for peace... The participants in the Congress responded to these words of the leader with thunderous applause, and the applause resounded throughout the Grand Kremlin Palace.

The great leader said: It would be wrong to think that our Party has become a strong party, and therefore no longer needs the support of fraternal parties and the support of foreign brother peoples. The characteristic of this support is: this support is integrated with the interests of the people of all countries.

The hall erupted in thunderous applause again. J.V. Stalin cited the words of Maurice Thorez and Palmiro Togliatti as examples to prove that fraternal support is integrated with the interests of the working people of France and Italy; they said: their people will never fight against the Soviet people.

Everyone in the hall listened attentively to Stalin's words, and every word deeply and truly moved them. The extremely excited thoughts and feelings aroused by the leader's words burst into bursts of applause from time to time. J.V. Stalin said: Our Party cannot but repay the fraternal communist parties. After we seized power in October 1917, they called our Party the "shock brigade" of the world revolutionary workers' movement, thereby expressing their hope that our success would alleviate the suffering of the people of all countries groaning under capitalist oppression. The great leader said slowly: I think our Party has not let this hope down... Warm cheers resounded throughout the hall, and the cheers were first issued from the seats of fraternal party representatives, where the outstanding leaders of the world workers' movement, Wilhelm Pieck, Maurice Thorez, Bolesław Bierut, Klement Gottwald, Mátyás Rákosi, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Vâlko Chervenkov, Dolores Ibárruri and many others were sitting.

The great leader spoke with a clear and ironic tone about the bourgeoisie. In the past, the bourgeoisie was considered the leader of the nation. Now it is selling national sovereignty in exchange for US dollars. J.V. Stalin then turned to the representatives of the fraternal parties, emphasizing: It is they who will have to raise the banner of national freedom if they want to become the leading force of their nation. These words won thunderous applause.

J.V. Stalin finally said: "Long live our fraternal parties! May the leaders of the fraternal parties be healthy and live long! Long live international peace! Down with the war makers!", At this time, there was a stormy and prolonged applause. The delegates and guests of the Congress cheered for J.V. Stalin, and the cheers shook the whole hall.

The Congress was closed by K.Y. Voroshilov.

At 22:25, the Chairman announced the closing of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Thunderous applause rang out in the hall, everyone stood up and shouted: "Comrade Stalin, hurrah!", "Glory to the great Stalin!". Delegates and guests of the Congress sang the party anthem "The Internationale" with extremely high enthusiasm. The hall resounded again with cheers for the great Stalin, and many languages ​​simultaneously cheered for the beloved leader and mentor, the great Stalin.

    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会闭幕
    斯大林同志等一百二十五人当选为联共中央委员
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十五日电：苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的最后一次会议于十月十四日在克里姆林宫大厅举行。
    午后九时，约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林和他最亲密的战友莫洛托夫、马林科夫、伏罗希洛夫、布尔加宁、贝利亚、卡冈诺维奇、赫鲁晓夫、安德列耶夫、米高扬、柯西金、什维尔尼克和代表大会主席团的其他委员在主席台上出现。代表们和来宾们以暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声欢迎他们。全场起立。大厅里响遍了为约·维·斯大林欢呼的声音。大家欢呼：“光荣归于斯大林同志！”，“斯大林同志万岁！”，“斯大林同志，乌拉！”。在苏联共产党代表大会代表和列席大会的外国共产党和工人党代表的热情迸发中，表现了对于这位劳动人民的伟大领袖、朋友和导师的诚挚的无限热爱和忠诚。
    主席伏罗希洛夫宣布开会。
    主席让代表库兹涅佐夫报告苏联共产党中央机构的选举结果。
    一百二十五个人当选为共产党中央委员会委员。在宣布当选名单中提到约·维·斯大林的名字时，大厅里又响起了热烈的掌声。全场起立，欢呼约·维·斯大林的声音经久不息。大家欢呼“斯大林同志万岁！”，“斯大林同志，乌拉！”。在提到约·维·斯大林的最亲密的战友的名字时，会场上响起了掌声。一百一十个人当选为共产党中央委员会候补委员，三十七个人当选为中央检查委员会委员。
    在党的中央机构选举结果宣布后，缅甸共产党中央委员会的代表向代表大会致贺词，他受到全场的热烈欢迎。他说：自从十月革命胜利后，苏维埃国土就成为世界上所有被压迫民族的灯塔和希望。苏联、斯大林同志站在争取和平与自由的人民的最前列，因而获得了世界上所有殖民地和附属国人民的热爱和尊敬。
    缅甸共产党中央委员会代表谈到了美英帝国主义者的阴谋，这些帝国主义者为了维持封建统治，正在缅甸煽动和组织反对人民大众的血腥战争。他们试图把缅甸变为侵略苏联和中华人民共和国的跳板。他说：但是帝国主义者的阴谋是不会实现的，因为缅甸人民在共产党的领导下拿起武器来，正为他们的民族独立、人民民主与和平进行斗争。
    接着他宣读缅甸共产党中央委员会致第十九次代表大会的贺电；代表们报以暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声。全体起立。
    接着发言的是加拿大劳工进步党执行委员会委员莫里斯。他受到了暴风雨般的掌声的欢迎。
    莫里斯说：出席强大的苏联共产党的代表大会、听到它的成就和伟大的计划、看到周围的劳动英雄和卫国战争的英雄、亲自看到建设人类老早就向往的共产主义社会，这不仅是看到苏联的前途，也是看到所有其他国家的前途。
    莫里斯说，世界上没有一个人像伟大的约瑟夫·斯大林那样清楚地给受难的人类指出走向持久和平、民族自由和人民民主的道路。任何撒谎的宣传都不能扼杀加拿大人民想知道苏联人民如何生活及其走的道路的热切的愿望。他说，我们有责任不使加拿大人民被战争宣传蒙蔽，不让他们陷在谎言的罗网里。
    莫里斯继续说，加拿大人民不再需要任何创纪录的失业数字、日益上涨的物价和赋税，不再允许用加拿大的原料去供给美国的战争机器，他们要的是跟苏联、人民民主国家和人民中国的亲密友谊和广泛的贸易。
    他的发言频频被经久不息的掌声所打断。
    印度共产党中央委员会委员高普兰出现在讲台上时，全场鼓掌。他向大会转达了印度全体共产党员和印度爱好自由的人民的热烈的、兄弟的革命敬礼。
    高普兰说，苏联的伟大成就、人民中国和人民民主国家的成就跟印度的情况恰成鲜明的对比：在印度，饥荒和失业笼罩着一切，消费品价格不断上涨，赋税和用于军事和警察方面的费用日益增加，公民自由受到限制。
    今天印度人民比从前任何时候都清楚地看到谁是他们的真正朋友。援助遭受饥荒的印度人民的是苏联和人民中国，而美帝国主义者则把霉烂的小麦和陈旧的棉织品送到印度。
    印度人民认识到以苏联为首的民主阵营才是一个真正的大公无私的朋友。他们看到了和平、自由、民主与社会主义阵营的日益增长的力量。他们同时还非常明显地看到了帝国主义阵营所能给予他们的一切东西：日益增涨的经济危机、生活水平的降低、失业、压迫、民族主权的丧失、警察统治与战争。
    帝国主义者想把印度拖进战争阵营，但是印度人民绝对不容许。他们将坚决地抵抗所有煽动战争的人。高普兰说，我们将努力使印度人民跟苏联、中国、人民民主国家和所有爱好和平的人民联合起来为争取持久和平、自由和民主而斗争。
    最后高普兰为印苏两国人民的团结、为世界全体劳动人民的团结、为苏联共产党及其伟大的领袖约·维·斯大林欢呼，他引起了代表大会的代表和来宾的暴风雨般的鼓掌。
    这位印度共产党的代表讲完了话，即按着东方的惯例，先向到会者鞠躬，然后向主席团鞠躬，最后在鼓掌声中离开了讲台。一会儿，全场肃然。主席宣布：“斯大林同志讲话。”
    伟大的领袖站起来，稳步地走向讲台。这时雷动的欢呼声震荡着大厅。全体起立。此起彼伏的“乌拉”声，震荡着克里姆林宫的墙壁。各种语言的欢呼声响成一片。充满苏维埃人民心灵的一切东西、共产党人最珍爱的东西，都一齐倾泻在这个表示着党对它的领袖的无限热爱和忠诚的欢呼声中。一分钟、两分钟，三分钟……过去了，欢呼声好像雪崩一样，劲头愈来愈大。最后由于大家急于要想听斯大林的讲话，欢呼声才停息下来……
    约·维·斯大林在讲演时首先以代表大会的名义，向所有派遣代表光临代表大会或给代表大会拍来贺电的兄弟党表示谢意。伟大的领袖感谢它们的兄弟般的祝贺，感谢它们的信任，这种信任表示它们愿意支持我们的党为各国人民争取一个光辉灿烂的前途而斗争、为反对战争而斗争、为维护和平而斗争……参加大会的人对领袖的这些话报以暴风雨般的鼓掌，掌声响遍了克里姆林宫大厅。
    伟大的领袖说：如果认为我们的党已成为一个强大的党，因而已不再需要各兄弟党的支持，不再需要外国兄弟人民的支持，那就错了。这种支持的特点是：这种支持是与各国人民的利益融合在一起的。
    会场又迸发出暴风雨般的掌声。约·维·斯大林引证莫里斯·多列士和巴尔米罗·陶里亚蒂的话作为例证，证明兄弟般的支持与法国和意大利劳动人民的利益融合在一起；他们说：他们的人民决不与苏联人民作战。
    大厅里的每一个人都屏息地倾听着斯大林的话，每一句话都深深地真正地打动了他们。由领袖的话所引起的极为兴奋的思想与感情不时迸发为一阵阵的掌声。约·维·斯大林说：我们的党不能不报答兄弟共产党。在一九一七年十月我们取得政权以后，它们把我们的党叫做世界革命工人运动的“突击队”，以此表示它们希望我们的成功减轻在资本主义压迫下呻吟的各国人民的痛苦。伟大的领袖慢慢说道：我想我们的党并没有辜负这种希望……热烈的欢呼声响遍了大厅，欢呼声是从兄弟党代表席位上首先发出的，那里坐着世界工人运动的卓越领袖威廉·皮克，莫里斯·多列士，波列斯拉夫·贝鲁特，克利门特·哥特瓦尔德，玛吉阿斯·拉科西，乔治乌—德治，维尔科·契尔文科夫，多洛列斯·伊巴露丽和许多其他的人。
    伟大的领袖用明明白白讽刺的口吻谈到资产阶级。从前，资产阶级被认为是民族的领袖。现在它出卖民族主权来换取美元。约·维·斯大林随后面向着兄弟党的代表，强调说：正是他们，将必须举起民族自由的旗帜，如果他们希望成为他们民族的领导力量的话。这些话博得了雷鸣般的掌声。
    约·维·斯大林最后说：“我们的兄弟党万岁！兄弟党的领袖们身体健康，万寿无疆！国际和平万岁！打倒战争制造者！”，这时全场响起暴风雨般经久不息的掌声。大会代表和来宾为约·维·斯大林而欢呼，欢呼声震动全场。
    大会由凯·叶·伏罗希洛夫致闭幕词。
    在二十二点二十五分，主席宣布苏联共产党第十九次代表大会闭幕。大厅中响起了暴风雨般的掌声，全体起立，高呼：“斯大林同志，乌拉！”，“光荣归于伟大的斯大林！”。代表大会代表和来宾们以极高度的热情合唱着党歌“国际歌”。大厅中再度震响着欢呼伟大的斯大林的声音，许多种语言同时为亲爱的领袖和导师、伟大的斯大林而欢呼。
