Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:

As a bacteriology expert, I am honored to participate in this conference of great historical significance, to join with ladies and gentlemen representing sixteen hundred million peace-loving and kind people to discuss the great plan for striving for and defending peace. On behalf of the Chinese scientific workers who are working to smash the insidious conspiracy of the US government's germ warfare, I extend my congratulations to the conference, greetings and respect to you all.

The esteemed Mr. Guo Moruo and Mr. Han Xueye both pointed out in their reports that for the sake of peace, it is necessary to immediately condemn and stop the germ warfare being conducted by the US government, and to demand that governments of all countries ratify and effectively implement the "Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare" concluded in Geneva in 1925. Subsequently, many ladies and gentlemen have spoken on this issue at this conference, emphasizing the importance of immediately stopping germ warfare for maintaining humanitarianism and the cause of peace. I fully agree with these opinions.

I believe it is my responsibility to report to you the facts I have personally confirmed regarding the use of bacterial weapons by the US armed forces in northern Korea and northeastern China.

Since the beginning of this year, after the shocking fact that the US Air Force and artillery units began dropping and launching bacterial weapons in northern Korea, I and dozens of other Chinese bacteriologists, entomologists, and pathologists immediately formed the "Chinese People's Volunteer Anti-Epidemic Inspection Team," left our quiet laboratories, and arrived in Korea to fight against the germ warfare launched by the United States together with Korean scientific experts. Subsequently, as the US government, disregarding the protests of the people of our country and world public opinion upholding justice, expanded its bacterial air raids to northeastern China and other places, my colleagues, including hundreds of excellent medical experts, also quickly mobilized to join the struggle against germ warfare.

Our task is to use the most rigorous scientific attitude and methods to collect first-hand materials, especially specimens of insects and other objects dropped by US aircraft, samples of bacterial containers, as well as people, livestock, and poultry who became sick or died due to infection by germs after the US air raids, and then follow the standard procedures of bacteriology, immunology, anatomy, and pathology to inspect, test, and experiment, so as to determine the types of pathogenic bacterial weapons used by the US germ warfare forces, in order to find effective defense methods to control and eliminate the spread of infectious diseases and ensure the safety of the lives of the Korean and Chinese people and the Korean and Chinese People's forces.

In order to complete this glorious and noble task, we cooperated closely with the health departments of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and with the health departments of local governments in various places, established research centers with complete scientific experimental equipment in Korea and northeastern China, and set up many anti-epidemic inspection stations. In order to thoroughly ascertain the facts and carry out effective epidemic prevention work, we often sent strong mobile quarantine teams to the sites of bacterial attacks to conduct on-the-spot investigations and personally collect specimens for the laboratory. The footprints of these mobile quarantine teams have covered all areas in Korea and northeastern China that have been subjected to bacterial attacks.

We quickly and completely determined that germ warfare is not only a fact, but also a planned and large-scale operation.

Our judgment is based on the following closely related facts:

First, since January of this year, the US Air Force units have been conducting air raids that do not involve the usual bombing and strafing, but specialize in scattering insects, spiders, rodents, and other objects. For example, according to incomplete statistics, in northern Korea, from January 28 to March 31, 1952, the areas where the United States scattered insects and other objects reached 70 counties and cities, with a total of 804 scattering incidents. In northeastern China, from February 29 to March 21, 1952, there were more than 40 counties and cities where scattering occurred.

Secondly, these large numbers of insects, spiders, rodents, and other objects that were discovered were not only proven by many on-site eyewitnesses to have been dropped by US aircraft, but also, judging from the various abnormal biological conditions at the time of their appearance, it can be determined that they were by no means naturally occurring locally, but were dropped by US military aircraft.

From the perspective of the place of discovery, many insects were found in places where they normally should not appear: for example, human fleas were found on the snow; marine clams wrapped in straw were found on the hillside; specimen insects of warehouse pests were found in the fields; black springtails that live in low-lying wetlands were found on the roof of a twelve-meter-high round building; human fleas were floating on the surface of water in open-air water tanks. These insects and objects appeared in large quantities in places where they should not have been, which strongly proves that the appearance of these insects was not natural, but was dropped by US aircraft.

From the perspective of the season of appearance, many are abnormal. Migratory locusts, oil gourds, Korean leopard mosquitoes, Cooley mosquitoes, various flies, and spiders were found in large numbers in Korea and northeastern China after US aircraft flew over in January and February to February and March this year. Precise identification proves that the appearance season of migratory locusts was advanced by three months, oil gourds by three months, Korean leopard mosquitoes and Cooley mosquitoes by more than two months, black flies, green flies, houseflies, and large houseflies by two to three months, and wolf spiders by about two months. Moreover, most of these insects and spiders were found in freezing weather below zero degrees Celsius.

From the perspective of the number of these insects, animals, and objects, it is also abnormal. We know that insects can sometimes appear early, but the number will never be large. However, the insects and other animals discovered in Korea and northeastern China after US aircraft flew over were massive, segmented, and densely packed. For example, tens of thousands of black flies appeared above and below a railway bridge; six to seven thousand houseflies appeared in a field area of twenty square meters; tens of thousands of oil gourds appeared on a snowfield with an area of no more than two thousand square meters; the human fleas found on the hillside darkened the ground; a large number of dead fish were found in dry rice fields and hillsides; one morning, residents of four villages suddenly discovered 717 identical small field mice, which was abnormal in quantity.

From the perspective of community relations, it is also abnormal. Insects with different habits and even those that harm each other often appear together, for example: black springtails are mixed with human fleas, oil gourds are mixed with chironomids, green flies appear with migratory locusts, black flies appear with wolf spiders. These are all impossible and extremely abnormal in nature.

From the perspective of the connection with the strange air raids conducted by US aircraft, these insects, animals, and objects were all discovered after US military aircraft invaded and engaged in activities. At the same time, the people's air defense organs also confirmed that US aircraft did indeed intrude and engage in abnormal activities. In northern Korea and northeastern China, soldiers and residents have personally seen US military aircraft dropping four-grid bacterial bombs, chalky bacterial bombs, or other containers, inside and around these containers, clustered insects were found. In other cases, people have repeatedly seen US military aircraft dropping luminous or red objects. Although no containers could be found after these objects landed, insects, spiders, feathers, or strange non-local leaves were found there. In addition, in northern Korea, people have personally witnessed US military aircraft scattering insects, and these insects even landed directly on their bodies and hats. For example, my colleague, the famous bacteriologist Dr. Wei Xi, and Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British "Daily Worker," were directly subjected to this bacterial air raid when they were investigating germ warfare in the field.

All the above facts strongly illustrate that these insects, animals, and objects were scattered by US military aircraft.

Furthermore, these insects, animals, and objects scattered by US aircraft have been proven to carry various highly toxic pathogens that kill humans, livestock, poultry, and crops.

My colleagues and I personally isolated the following highly virulent pathogens from these insects, animals, and objects: plague bacillus from human fleas and small field mice; Vibrio cholerae from clams and black flies; Bacillus anthracis from black flies, specimen insects, wolf spiders, and feathers; and Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi, and Shigella dysenteriae from some flies.

Finally, the germs carried by these insects and objects dropped by US aircraft have caused soldiers and officers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, as well as peaceful residents of Korea, such as Ge Quanshu, Park Yeonho, and the remaining thirty-eight people, to die of plague, peaceful residents of Pyongyang, Korea, such as 68-year-old Han Sang-guk and his two grandsons, and Zhao Wanfu, a farmer from Daedong County, and his wife, Li Yingzi, to die of cholera, and many residents in Liaodong and Liaoxi, northeastern China, to be infected with previously rare respiratory anthrax and anthrax meningitis, and hundreds of residents in and around Shenyang to suffer from a new type of encephalitis. My colleagues and I personally examined the bodies of our compatriots who died from the US government's bacterial attacks, as well as the beloved neighbors and victims in Korea; we have personally witnessed the wailing and unbearable suffering of the relatives of the deceased. Our hearts have been left with wounds that can never be healed.

The US government's bacterial attacks are not only intended to kill the peaceful people of Korea and China, but also to destroy the livestock, poultry, and crops of the people of the two countries, so as to make the peaceful residents fall into starvation and death. This insidious conspiracy includes the use of wolf spiders and other insects to spread hemorrhagic septicemia Pasteurella to destroy chickens, ducks, and other animals, the spreading of terrible anthrax bacteria to destroy cattle, horses, donkeys, and other draft animals, and the use of plants to spread plant anthrax, purple spot disease, and bunt fungi that damage crops such as soybeans, cotton, corn, and apples. These facts have also been completely confirmed by my colleagues, veterinary medicine experts Dr. Hu Xiangbi and Dr. Cheng Shaojiong, and plant pathology experts Professor Qiu Weifan and Professor Shen Qiyi.

All the above facts have sufficient human and material evidence: there are containers, insects, animals, and objects airdropped by US military aircraft as evidence, there are on-site eyewitnesses—thousands upon thousands of good residents—as witnesses, there are Chinese and Korean scientists as witnesses, and there are also special agents airdropped by the US invading forces in Korea as witnesses, and there are also US Air Force officers who have performed bacterial warfare missions and were later captured as witnesses.

Anyone who is objective, fair, and faces the truth and facts, facing all this conclusive evidence, no one can deny the fact that the US government is conducting germ warfare. Anyone who has conscience, a sense of justice, cares about humanitarianism, cares about the cause of peace, cares about the fate of science and the future of human civilization, facing this shocking atrocity, no one can remain silent without angrily condemning it.

Ladies and gentlemen, you all know that many fair international organizations and famous people loyal to the cause of peace and humanitarianism, such as the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers headed by the esteemed Professor Brandweiner, Dr. James Endicott, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, Mr. Farge, Chairman of the French National Peace Council, Dr. Hewlett Johnson, Dean of Canterbury, Mrs. Felton, and representatives from various countries who attended the Moscow International Economic Conference and later came to China, and representatives from various countries who attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Region Peace Conference held in Beijing, have conducted on-the-spot investigations or studied the factual evidence we provided, and unanimously confirmed the US government's crime of conducting germ warfare. Recently, the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of the Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China," composed of Dr. Undritz of Sweden, Professor Madrelle of France, Professor Joseph Needham of the United Kingdom, Professor Olivo of Italy, Professor Bressao of Brazil, and Academician Zhukov-Veresnikov of the Soviet Union, after more than two months of on-site investigation and careful research, further confirmed the fact that the US armed forces used bacterial weapons in Korea and northeastern China. The results of their great work—"Report of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of the Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China" have been published.

Dear delegates, each member of the International Scientific Commission did not believe in the existence of germ warfare before conducting more than two months of arduous investigation. However, after two months of investigation and research, they not only acknowledged all the facts of the US conducting germ warfare in Korea and northeastern China, but also, out of concern for the fate of mankind, and regardless of the persecution they may suffer, bravely fought for anti-germ warfare.

Now, the important thing is that peace fighters in our countries take action to widely publicize the report of the International Scientific Commission—as Madam Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, who is respected by the Chinese people, said—that our conference take action to call on the people of all countries to condemn and stop the germ warfare being conducted by the US government, and urgently demand that governments of all countries ratify and effectively implement the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which embodies the conscience of mankind. If the people of all countries do not take united action to exert strong pressure, the germ warfare criminals will not confess their guilt and will not stop the despicable atrocities of manufacturing artificial plagues.

The publication of the International Scientific Commission report has alarmed those criminals who are conducting germ warfare. They cannot offer any reason to oppose any chapter or any point in the report. They are silent about the contents of this massive and irrefutable report. But despite this, the US State Department certainly refuses to admit the unspeakable crimes they have committed, and they still deny their crimes empty-mouthedly and without any factual basis. They are as embarrassed and furious as a thief caught on the spot, and attempt to persecute the members of the International Scientific Commission who dare to reveal the truth. As everyone knows, the US semi-official newspaper "New York Times," in its editorial on September 16, strongly implied that the scientists from Western countries in the committee were not loyal to the "group that uses bacterial weapons," and openly demanded that their governments "interrogate" these scientists who are loyal to the truth.

However, we Chinese have a proverb, "Fire cannot be wrapped in paper." Empty-mouthed denials cannot conceal their criminal acts. Please allow me to tell you about my own experience.

I myself was one of the earliest witnesses and accusers of the Japanese militarist government's germ warfare against the Chinese people. In 1941, a group of Japanese Air Force planes invaded Changde County in Hunan Province, China, and engaged in abnormal activities. These planes did not engage in ordinary bombing and strafing, but dropped large quantities of grains, wheat, and miscellaneous grains. Shortly thereafter, a plague epidemic broke out in that area, and many of my compatriots died tragically as a result. After this incident, I went to that area to conduct an on-the-spot investigation and determined that the Japanese Air Force used grains and miscellaneous grains to carry fleas infected with plague bacillus to create a plague epidemic. I wrote the results of that investigation into the "Changde Plague Report" to expose and accuse the Japanese army of conducting germ warfare.

Like the current US government, the Japanese government at the time completely denied our accusations. Under the lies and deceptions of the Japanese government, many people in Japan and other countries did not believe our accusations at the time, thinking that the Japanese government and Japanese generals would not be so despicable and shameless as to reach this point. But as everyone knows, the truth cannot be hidden. Later, in 1949, the trial of Japanese germ warfare criminals held by the Soviet Maritime Territory in Khabarovsk brought the truth to light, and the defendant Japanese germ warfare criminals all confessed to the facts I exposed in the "Changde Plague Report."

Didn't the Hitler gang always deny the horrific crimes they committed, such as the massacres they manufactured in Wittingburg and Auschwitz? Those gentlemen of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the so-called "only fair and neutral international organization," should remember best that they tried their best to help the Hitler gang deny these crimes they committed? But everyone also knows that at the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, the Hitler gang also fully confessed to their above-mentioned crimes and other crimes.

I dare to assert that the US government and US generals will certainly not be able to hide their heinous crimes of conducting germ warfare.

The US government, US generals, and their newspapers and periodicals tell us that they would never be so conscience-stricken as to scatter germs to massacre humans; they also say that our accusations are a stain on their reputation! Well, I want to ask them: If so, why do you refuse to ratify the 1925 "Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare," which you yourselves signed? If so, why have you stubbornly refused to pass the solemn proposal of the Soviet Union in the United Nations Security Council and the Disarmament Committee on requiring governments of all countries to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol? Why did your government delegation, because it anticipated that it would be difficult to prevent the recent Toronto International Red Cross Conference from passing a resolution requiring the ratification of the 1925 Geneva Protocol, announce that it would abstain from voting before the meeting? Why are you so afraid of the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which embodies the conscience of mankind?

I also want to ask them: Since you would never engage in the despicable act of scattering germs, then why do you prepare for germ warfare so vigorously? In March of this year, Brigadier General Bullen, Commander of your Army Chemical Corps, also requested Congress to allocate additional funds to expand germ warfare research work? Why do you say that "bacteria, poison gas, and radioactive materials may prove to be the cheapest weapons to conquer the enemy," and say that when considering weapons that will kill the enemy, there is no need to consider any moral concepts?

I hope that the US government, US generals, and the editors of their newspapers and periodicals will come out and answer these questions of mine, or even just answer any one of these questions.

The fact that the US government protects and uses Japanese and German "germ warfare experts" should also be mentioned. In this regard, I myself am also a witness. I have already mentioned above the "Changde Plague Report" I wrote. After Japan surrendered in 1945, the Allied countries during World War II organized an international military tribunal in Tokyo to try Japanese war criminals. At that time, an American judge came to Chongqing to ask me for this report and asked me to sign the report as a witness. But after the report was deceived, it was like a stone sinking into the sea, without any news. And Japanese germ warfare criminals, such as Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano, have not only been at large to this day, but have also been raised and used by US generals. According to newspaper reports, they have also been sent to the Korean front to assist in planning and directing large-scale germ warfare against the Korean and Chinese people. And Nazi German germ warfare criminal Schreiber was also hired by the US Department of Defense. These are undeniable facts.

All these facts prove that the bacterial attacks carried out against the Korean and Chinese people are planned and deliberate by the US government. And judging from the huge scale of the US government's preparation for germ warfare, today's bacterial warfare against the Korean and Chinese people is just a signal for them to carry out germ warfare on a larger scale in the future. Therefore, it is very clear that if the people of all countries do not immediately unite to condemn and stop the germ warfare being conducted by the US government, then the disaster that has befallen the Korean and Chinese people today will befall the people of the whole world tomorrow.

Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen! The continued Korean War, and the use of heinous bacterial weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in Korea, is indeed a problem that worries and unsettles the people of Asian and Pacific countries, and all kind people in the world. In these days when we are meeting here, the situation in Korea has not only not improved, but on the contrary, it is getting worse and worse. At the truce negotiation meeting on October 8, the US representative has stubbornly rejected the fair and reasonable new proposal put forward by the Korean and Chinese side based on the principle of complete repatriation and adopted some of the US side's opinions, and unilaterally announced the indefinite suspension of the truce negotiations. This means that they have openly refused to solve the problem fairly and reasonably through negotiation, and openly sabotage the truce negotiations, in an attempt to expand the war.

Obviously, if the Korean War does not stop for a day, the threat of germ warfare will constantly hang over the people of all of Asia, the Pacific region, and the world. Therefore, the people of the entire Asian and Pacific region must unite closely with the peace-loving people of the world, strengthen their efforts to stop the germ warfare being conducted by the US government, to achieve a truce in Korea and a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and to strive for and defend peace in Asia, the Pacific region, and the world! Thank you!

专栏：

    中国代表团团员、细菌学专家
    陈文贵关于美国武装部队在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的发言主席先生，各位女士和先生们：
    作为一个细菌学专家，我很荣幸地能够参加这次具有伟大历史意义的会议，来和代表着十六亿爱好和平的善良人民的各位女士和先生们在一道，共同讨论争取和保卫和平的大计。我谨代表正在为粉碎美国政府细菌战的恶毒阴谋而工作的中国科学工作者，向大会致贺，向各位问好并致敬。
     可敬的郭沫若先生和韩雪野先生，在他们的报告中，都曾经指出，为了和平的利益，必须立即谴责和制止美国政府进行的毁灭人类的细菌战，必须要求各国政府批准和切实履行一九二五年在日内瓦订立的“关于禁用毒气或类似毒品及细菌方法作战议定书”。以后，许多女士和先生们在这个会议上的发言中都谈到了这个问题，并强调地指出了立即制止细菌战对于维护人道主义与和平事业的重要性。我完全赞同这些意见。
    我认为在这里向你们各位报告我自己所亲自证实的美国武装部队在朝鲜北部和中国东北等地使用细菌武器的事实，是我所应尽的责任。
    自今年年初，美国空军和炮兵部队开始向朝鲜北部投掷和发射细菌武器，这种令人震惊的事实发生之后，我和其他几十位中国的细菌学家、昆虫学家、病理学家，就立即组成“中国人民志愿防疫检验队”，离开了我们的安静的实验室，到达朝鲜，和朝鲜的科学专家们在一起，为制止美国所发动的细菌战而斗争。随后，由于美国政府不顾我国人民及全世界主持正义的舆论的抗议，把细菌空袭扩大到中国东北等地，我的同事们，包括成百优秀的医学专家，也迅速动员起来，投入反细菌战的斗争。
    我们的任务，就是用最严格的科学态度和方法，来搜集第一手的材料，特别是美国飞机空投下来的昆虫及其他物体的标本，细菌容器的样品，以及在美国空袭后因感染病菌而致病、致死的人、家畜、家禽等，然后遵循细菌学、免疫学、解剖及病理学的常规的标准办法，加以检验、试验和实验，从而判明美国细菌战部队所使用的致病细菌武器的种类，以便找出有效的防御办法，来控制和扑灭被散播的传染病，保障朝中人民和朝中人民部队的生命安全。
    为了完成这个光荣而崇高的任务，我们与中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的卫生机关，并与各地地方政府的卫生机关密切合作，在朝鲜及中国东北等地设立了拥有完善的科学实验设备的研究中心，并设立了许多防疫检验站。为了彻底判明事实，并进行有效的防疫工作，我们时常派出强有力的流动检疫队，前往受到细菌袭击的现场去作实地勘查，并亲自去搜集实验室的标本。这些流动检疫队的足迹，遍及朝鲜及中国东北等各个受到细菌攻袭的地区。
    我们很快地就完全判明了，细菌战不但是事实，而且是有计划地、大规模地进行的。
    我们的这种判断，是根据于以下各种互相紧密联系的事实：
    首先是，自今年一月起，美国空军部队进行了一种不从事于通常的轰炸和扫射，而专事撒布昆虫、蜘蛛、啮齿动物和其他物体的空袭。举例来说，根据不完全统计，在朝鲜北部，从一九五二年一月二十八日到三月三十一日，美国撒布昆虫等物体的地区即达七十个郡市，撒布次数共达八百零四次之多。在中国东北，从一九五二年二月二十九日至三月二十一日，撒布地区也有四十余县市之多。
    其次，这些被发现的大量昆虫、蜘蛛、啮齿动物和其他物体，不但有许多在场目击者证明是美国飞机投下的，而且就它们出现时的生物学上的各种反常情况来说，也可以断定它们决不是本地自然发生的，而是由美军飞机所投下的。
    从发现场所来看，很多昆虫是在它们通常不该出现的地方发现的：例如，在雪面上发现了人蚤；在山坡上发现了用草包着的海产的蛤蜊；在田野里发现了仓库害虫的标本虫；在十二公尺高的圆楼顶上发现了习居于低湿地区的黑跳虫；在露天水缸的水面上飘浮着人蚤。这些昆虫和物体都是大量地在不应有的场所出现的，这就有力地证明了这些昆虫的出现不是自然的，而是美国飞机投下的。
    从出现的季节来看，很多是反常的。飞蝗、油葫芦、高丽豹脚蚊、库雷蚊、各种蝇类以及蜘蛛等，均在今年一、二月至二、三月间在美国飞机飞过之后便在朝鲜及中国东北等地大量发现。精密地鉴定证明：飞蝗的出现季节提前了三个月，油葫芦提前了三个月，高丽豹脚蚊、库雷蚊提前了两个多月，黑蝇、绿蝇、家蝇、大家蝇提前了两至三个月，狼蛛提前了约两个月。而且这些昆虫、蜘蛛多半是在零度以下的冰天雪地中发现的。
    从这些昆虫、动物和物体出现的数量来看，也是反常的。我们知道昆虫固然有时可以提早出现，但为数决不会很多。然而在美国飞机飞过后在朝鲜及中国东北等地所发现的昆虫及其他动物，却是大量、有段落地密集的。例如：在一个铁路桥梁的上下出现了数万个黑蝇；在二十平方公尺面积的野地上出现了六、七千头家蝇；在面积不超过二千平方公尺的雪地上出现了上万的油葫芦；在山坡上发现的人蚤，遮黑了地面；在干稻田里及山坡上发现了大批死鱼；在一个清晨，四个村庄的居民突然发现了七百一十七只同样的小田鼠，这在数量上都是反常的。
    从群落关系上来看，同样是反常的。习性相异的甚而互相残害的昆虫常常混同出现，例如：黑跳虫中夹杂着人蚤，油葫芦混合着摇蚊，绿蝇与飞蝗一起出现，黑蝇与狼蛛一起出现，这些在自然界都是不可能的，都是极端反常的。
    从与美国飞机举行奇怪的空袭情况的联系来看，这些昆虫、动物与物体都是在美军飞机侵入活动之后发现的。同时人民防空机关也证实了美机确曾侵入及从事反常活动。在朝鲜北部和中国东北地区，曾多次有士兵和居民亲自看见美军飞机投下四格型细菌弹、白垩质细菌弹或其他容器等，在这些容器的里面和周围，都发现了群集的昆虫。在其他情况下，亦曾有人屡次看见美军飞机投下发光或红色物体，这些物体落地后虽找不到容器，但在那里却发现有昆虫、蜘蛛、羽毛或奇怪的非本地所有的树叶。此外，在朝鲜北部亦曾有人亲见美军飞机撒布昆虫，这些昆虫甚至直接落在他们的身上和衣帽上。例如我的同事、著名的细菌学家魏曦博士，以及英国“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿等，当他们在野外调查细菌战的事实时，就直接受到了这种细菌空袭。
    以上种种事实，强有力地说明着，这些昆虫、动物和物体是美军飞机所撒布下来的。
    再其次，这些为美国飞机所撒布下来的昆虫、动物和物体，已经证明是携带有屠杀人类、牲畜、家禽和田禾的各种毒性很强的病原体的。
    我和我的同事们从这些昆虫、动物和物体当中，亲自分离出了以下毒力很强的病原体：从人蚤和小田鼠中，分离出了鼠疫杆菌；从蛤蜊、黑蝇中分离出霍乱弧菌；从黑蝇、标本虫、狼蛛和羽毛中，分离出炭疽杆菌；从一些蝇类中，也分离出肠伤寒杆菌、副伤寒杆菌、赤痢杆菌等。
    最后，这些为美国飞机所投下的昆虫和物体所携带着的病菌，已使朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的士兵、军官以及朝鲜和平居民如葛权书、朴然浩和其余的三十八人死于鼠疫，使朝鲜平壤的和平居民六十八岁的韩相国和他的两个孙子、大同郡的农民赵万福和他的妻子李英子死于霍乱，使中国东北辽东和辽西两地不少的居民感染了向所少见的呼吸道炭疽病和炭疽性脑膜炎，使沈阳及其附近地区的成百居民遭受了新型脑炎的侵害。我和我的同事们，曾经亲自检验了我们的这些死于美国政府的细菌攻击的同胞、以及我们的亲爱的邻人朝鲜受难者的尸体；我们曾亲见死者亲属们的号啕痛哭和不堪忍受的悲苦。我们的心灵已经留下了永远不能愈合的创伤。
    美国政府的细菌攻击不但是要杀害朝中两国的和平人民，而且还要毁灭两国人民的家畜、家禽和农作物，以使和平居民陷于饥馑和死亡。这种恶毒的阴谋中，包括借狼蛛和其他昆虫来撒布出血性败血症巴氏杆菌，以毁灭鸡、鸭及其他动物，借撒布可怕炭疽菌来毁灭牛、马、驴等耕畜，用植物体来撒布损害大豆、棉花、玉米、苹果等等农作物的植物炭疽、紫斑病、黑粉病真菌等等。这些事实，也已经为我的同事兽医学专家胡祥璧博士、程绍?博士，植物病理学专家裘维蕃教授、沈其益教授等所完全判明了。
    以上种种事实都是有充分的人证物证的：有美军飞机空投的容器、昆虫、动物和物体作证，有现场目击者——上千上万的善良居民作证，有中朝科学家作证，并且还有美国侵朝军队所派遣的空投特务作证，还有执行过细菌战任务而在以后被俘了的美国空军军官作证。
    凡是客观的、公正的、正视真理和事实的人们，面对着这一切确凿证据，没有一个人是能够否认美国政府进行细菌战的事实的。凡是有良知的、有正义感的、关心人道主义、关心和平事业、关心科学命运和人类文明前途的人们，面对着这种使人惊骇的暴行，没有一个人是能够保持缄默而不加以愤怒斥责的。
    各位女士和先生们想来都已经知道，许多公正的国际团体和忠于和平及人道主义事业的著名人士，例如以可敬的布兰德魏纳教授为首的国际民主法律工作者协会调查团，加拿大和平大会主席文幼章博士，法国全国和平理事会主席法奇先生，英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊博士，费尔顿夫人，以及参加莫斯科国际经济会议后来中国的各国代表们，参加在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的各国代表们，都作了实地调查或者研究了我们所提供的事实证据，而一致地证实了美国政府进行细菌战的罪行。最近，由瑞典的安德琳博士、法国的马戴尔教授、英国的李约瑟教授、意大利的欧利佛教授、巴西的贝索亚教授和苏联的茹科夫—维勒斯尼科夫院士所组成的“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”，经过了两个多月的现场调查和缜密研究之后，又进一步地证实了美国武装部队在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器的事实。他们的巨大工作的成果—“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书”已经公布了。
    亲爱的代表先生们，国际科学委员会每一位委员并不是在进行两个月以上的艰难的调查工作以前，就相信了细菌战的存在的。但是，在两个月的调查研究之后，他们不但承认了美国在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战的全部事实，并且，由于关怀人类的命运，而不顾自身可能遭受的迫害在为反细菌战而勇敢地进行斗争。
    现在重要的事情，是在于我们各国的和平战士们采取行动，来广为宣传国际科学委员会的报告书——如同为中国人民所尊敬的赖普吾夫人所说的那样，在于我们的大会采取行动，号召各国人民来谴责和制止美国政府所进行的毁灭人类的细菌战，并迫切要求各国政府批准和切实履行表现了人类良心的一九二五年日内瓦议定书。如果各国人民不采取团结一致的行动，来施行强大的压力，细菌战犯是不会肯认罪，也不会停止制造人工瘟疫的卑鄙暴行的。
    国际科学委员会报告书的公布，已经引起了进行细菌战的那些罪犯们的惊慌。他们举不出任何理由来反对报告书的任何一章或任何一个论点。他们对于这个庞大而颠扑不破的报告书的内容，缄口不言。但是尽管这样，美国国务院当然是不肯说出他们所犯的这种不可告人的罪行的，他们仍然空口地、没有任何事实根据地来否认他们的罪行。他们像一个当场被捉住的偷贼一样，狼狈万状，恼羞成怒，企图迫害敢于揭露事实真相的国际科学委员会的委员们。如同大家所知道的，美国半官方报纸“纽约时报”，在其九月十六日的社论中，已经强烈地暗示委员会中的西方各国的科学家们是不忠于“使用细菌武器的集团”的，并公然要求他们的政府“盘问”这些忠于真理的科学家们。
    但是，我们中国有一句谚语，叫做“纸包不住火”。空口的否认是掩饰不住他们的犯罪行为的。请容许我在这里讲述一段我自己的经历吧。
    我自己曾经是日本军国主义政府对中国人民进行细菌战的最早的见证人和控告人之一。在一九四一年时，日本空军的一批飞机曾侵入中国湖南省的常德县进行反常的活动。这批飞机并不从事普通的轰炸和扫射，而是投下大量的谷麦和杂粮。接着不久，就在那个地区内发生了腺鼠疫的流行，我的许多同胞因此而惨遭死亡。这一事件发生之后，我即前往那个地区作了实地调查，并判明了日本空军利用谷麦杂粮来携带感染了鼠疫杆菌的跳蚤，以制造鼠疫流行的事实。我曾经把那次调查的结果，写成了“常德鼠疫报告书”，来揭发和控告日本军队进行细菌战的罪行。
    和现在的美国政府一样，当时的日本政府完全否认我们的指责。在日本政府的谎言欺骗之下，日本和其他国家的许多人，当时也不相信我们的指责，认为日本政府和日本的将军们还不至于卑鄙无耻达到这步田地。但是正如大家所知道的，事实是掩藏不了的，以后在一九四九年，苏联滨海军区在伯力对日本细菌战犯所举行的审判，已使真相大白于天下，而被告的日本细菌战犯们也全部供出了我在“常德鼠疫报告书”中所揭发的事实。
    希特勒匪帮对于他们所犯下的骇人听闻的罪行，例如他们在威丁堡和奥斯威辛所制造的集体屠杀的大惨案，不也是始终矢口否认的吗？所谓“唯一公正的中立的国际组织”的红十字国际委员会的那些先生们，应该记得最清楚，他们当时不是出尽了气力来帮助希特勒匪帮否认他们所犯的这些罪行吗？但是大家也知道，在纽伦堡国际军事法庭上，希特勒匪帮也全部供认了他们的上述罪行以及其他罪行。
    我敢断言，美国政府和美国将军们要想掩藏住他们进行细菌战的万恶罪行，也是一定办不到的。
    美国政府、美国将军和他们的报纸、期刊告诉我们说，他们决不如此丧尽天良，以至于要撒布细菌来屠杀人类；还说是我们的指责是玷辱了他们的名誉！好吧，我要质问他们：既然如此，你们为什么要拒绝批准你们自己签了字的一九二五年“关于禁用毒气或类似毒品及细菌方法作战议定书”呢？既然如此你们为什么又在联合国安理会以及裁军委员会上顽固不化地拒绝通过苏联关于要求各国政府批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书的庄严议案呢？为什么你们的政府代表团，因为预先估计到将会难以阻止在不久以前举行的多伦多国际红十字大会通过要求批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书的决议案，而在开会以前就宣布放弃投票权呢？你们为什么那样地害怕表现了人类良心的一九二五年日内瓦议定书呢？
    我还要质询他们：既然你们决不会从事撒布细菌这种玷辱人类的勾当，那么，你们为什么又要大张旗鼓地准备细菌战，就在今年三月，你们的陆军化学兵团司令布伦少将还向国会要求增拨款项来扩充细菌战的研究工作呢？你们为什么要说“细菌、毒气和放射性物质可能证明是征服敌人的最廉价的武器”，并且说在考虑致敌人于死命的武器时，不必考虑什么道德观念呢？
    我希望美国政府、美国将军和他们的报纸期刊的编辑先生们，走出来回答我的这些问题，甚至仅仅是回答这些问题中的任何一个问题。
    美国政府庇护并且利用日本和德国“细菌战专家”的事实，也是应该提到的。在这方面，我自己也是一个见证人。在上面我已经提到过我所写的“常德鼠疫报告书”。一九四五年日本投降后，第二次世界大战时期的各盟国曾在东京组织了国际军事法庭来审判日本战犯。当时曾有一个美国法官亲到重庆向我索取这篇报告书，并要求我在报告书上签名作证。但在报告书被骗去以后，就如石沉大海，毫无声息。而日本的细菌战犯，如石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏等则至今不但逍遥法外，而且被美国将军们所豢养和利用。据报纸消息，他们并且被派到朝鲜前线，去协助策划和指挥对朝中人民进行的大规模的细菌战。而纳粹德国细菌战犯施莱勃，也为美国国防部所聘用。这些都是不能否认的事实。
    以上这些事实证明，对朝中人民所施行的细菌攻击乃是美国政府有计划地蓄意进行的。而就美国政府准备细菌战的巨大规模看来，今天对朝中人民的细菌作战，不过是他们在将来更大规模地进行细菌战的信号罢了。因此，很明白，如果各国人民不立即一致起来谴责和制止美国政府进行的细菌战，那么，今天落在朝中人民头上的灾难，明天就会落在全世界人民的头上。
    主席先生，各位女士和先生们！朝鲜战争的继续进行，以及万恶的细菌武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器等的在朝鲜被使用，的确是一个使亚洲和太平洋各国以及全世界善良人民焦虑和不安的问题。就在我们在这里开会的这几天，朝鲜形势不但没有改善，而且相反地是越来越恶化了。在十月八日的停战谈判会议上，美国代表已经蛮横地拒绝朝中方面根据全部遣返原则，并采纳了美方部分意见的公平合理的新提案，而片面地宣布无限期中止停战谈判。这就是说，他们已经公开地拒绝用协商方法来公平合理地解决问题，并公开地破坏停战谈判，企图借此来扩大战事。
    显然地，朝鲜战争如果一天不停止，细菌战的威胁就一天不断地悬在全亚洲及太平洋区域与全世界人民的头上。因此，全亚洲及太平洋区域的人民必须与全世界爱好和平人民紧密地团结在一起，为制止美国政府进行的细菌战，为达到朝鲜的停战和朝鲜问题的和平解决，为争取和保卫亚洲、太平洋区域以及全世界的和平而加强努力！谢谢你们！                                   （新华社）
