Comrades!

The Central Committee’s report, the draft of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the draft revision of the Party Constitution, and Comrade Stalin’s brilliant work on the economic problems of socialism in the USSR, published on the eve of the congress, illuminate the path of great historical significance already traversed, and the path to the communist society whose outline is becoming increasingly clear, which only the light of Stalin’s genius can illuminate.

As our powerful party convenes its 19th Congress, we should pay tribute to the man who nurtured us, organized us, led us through various difficulties and trials, and is confidently leading us toward the complete victory of communism, the great architect of communism, Comrade Stalin! (Stormy applause)

In Stalin’s new work on the economic problems of socialism in the USSR, in this treasure trove of thought, of particular significance are the basic economic law of socialism and the basic economic law of modern capitalism, discovered and clearly defined by Comrade Stalin.

The essence of the basic economic law of modern capitalism is to ensure maximum profit through the exploitation of man by man. In contrast, the essence of the basic economic law of socialism is to guarantee the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by means of the continuous development and improvement of socialist production on the basis of the highest technology.

Comrade Stalin also pointed out the important, but not fundamental, law of planned, proportional development of the national economy, which is of great significance to us. He pointed out that this law can only be fully applied based on the basic socialist economic law.

Comrade Stalin discovered the essence of the objective socialist economic law, thereby further consolidating our party and strengthening the scientific basis of the party's policies.

Comrade Stalin timely poured cold water on the heads of those comrades who were blinded by our great victories. These people concluded that objective economic laws were no longer useful, and that the laws were now made by them, which in fact led them into the realm of idealist philosophy and made them adventurists in economic policy.

Comrade Stalin thoroughly exposed the confused thinking of some comrades: some of them believed that the law of value was of no use at all under socialism; others mechanically applied the application of the law of value to the practice of socialism, and practically communism.

Comrade Stalin clearly and unambiguously pointed out that as long as commodity production continues, the law of value will continue to function in our country. However, the field of application of this law is strictly limited and placed within a certain scope, because our commodity production is a special commodity production, and its scope of application is limited to goods for personal consumption.

Comrade Stalin's new work gives us a concept that explains the main issues concerning the gradual transition from socialism to communism, the establishment of the material and technical foundation of communism, the elimination of the main differences between urban and rural areas, and the elimination of the main differences between mental and manual labor. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the basis of our commodity circulation lies in the difference between the two forms of socialist ownership—ownership by the whole people and collective farm group ownership. He described the methods for raising collective farm ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people, on the basis of which commodity circulation will gradually be replaced by a system of product exchange. At the same time, this will also cause the law of value and other factors of commodity economy to cease their function.

Comrade Stalin pointed out that the sprouts of product exchange already exist because we implement the method of "supply" of agricultural products by the state entering into contracts with collective farms that grow cotton, hemp, sugar beets, and other crops. According to his plan, these sprouts should be organized in all sectors of agriculture, and they should be developed into a vast system of product exchange, so that collective farms, in handing over their products, will obtain not only money, but mainly manufactured goods that they need, because manufactured goods are stored up and in the hands of the state. Therefore, the work of the procurement and trade organizations engaged in exchange between urban and rural areas must be greatly reorganized.

Comrade Stalin instructed: it is necessary "to eliminate the surplus products of collective farm production from the system of commodity circulation, and include them in the product exchange system between state industry and collective farms," and without special haste, but consistently and without hesitation, to gradually narrow the scope of commodity circulation, expand the scope of product exchange, and incorporate the surplus products of collective farm production into the state planned system, or in other words, prepare for the gradual transition to the distribution method of communist labor products.

Practice has proven that "product supply" is beneficial to collective farms. Therefore, implementing a product exchange system in all collective farms throughout the country will greatly benefit collective farm peasants.

In the current stage of world history and our history, it is unimaginable that we can live, build, and struggle without fully understanding the new doctrines that Comrade Stalin has brought to Marxist-Leninist science regarding the laws and paths of social development. (Applause)

Comrade Stalin illuminates our lives with scientific brilliance, gives us a program of action, and guides us victoriously towards communism.

Comrade Stalin taught us: "Socialism can only be victoriously built on the basis of higher labor productivity than under the capitalist system, on the basis of an abundance of products and various consumer goods, and on the basis of a prosperous and cultured life for all members of society."

Our party has greatly increased the output of general consumer goods and food.

The new Five-Year Plan stipulates the continued substantial development of light industry and the food industry.

A characteristic of the development of our food industry is that the output of more valuable foods is increasing even more rapidly. This is entirely in line with the constantly growing needs of our people. The production and consumption of meat, dairy products, fish, vegetables, fruits, sugar, and other products in our country are increasing rapidly, so the rate of increase in bread production is relatively slow.

Similarly, the demand for cheap cotton fabrics has decreased, while the demand for high-grade wool fabrics, silk fabrics, rayon fabrics, and fine cotton fabrics has increased.

The production of salt, matches, and kerosene needed for household use has fully met the needs, so there is no need to increase the production of these items much. This is truly remarkable. Not long ago, the issue of supplying these commodities to rural areas still needed special attention.

The improvement in consumption levels requires a substantial increase in the production of wheat bread and a decrease in the production of rye bread. The production of wheat bread and wheat rolls in 1952 was twice the production in 1940 and will continue to increase.

Bread baked by large bread factories is rapidly increasing, gradually replacing small bakeries and home-baked bread.

The following figures can illustrate this: In 1936, 353 cities consumed bread supplied by industrial production. By 1952, this number had increased to 1,104, which is 751 more than in 1936. Our baking industry is moving towards mechanization and automation on a large scale. 78% to 98% of the main production processes have been mechanized and automated, and by the end of the five-year period, these production processes will be 100% mechanized and automated.

The Five-Year Plan stipulates the construction of a large number of new bread baking factories in areas where there are not enough bread baking factories. There are still such areas now.

The task of the responsible personnel of the baking industry is to increase the variety of bread and other baked goods in various cities, improve the taste and nutritional value of bread and other baked goods, and raise production efficiency to the level of the first-class bread baking factories in Moscow and Leningrad; as for these two cities, they will move forward again.

The drying of vegetables and potatoes in our country is quite backward. Under Comrade Stalin's initiative, a huge plan for building modern factories for drying potatoes and vegetables was adopted; by the end of the five-year period, their total production capacity will make it possible to dry 1.1 million tons of fresh potatoes and vegetables annually. This ensures that potatoes and vegetables can be transported to the northern and other remote areas of the Soviet Union and guarantees a continuous supply of these items to the entire people in all seasons of the year.

The Five-Year Plan also stipulates that the production of fresh and refrigerated vegetables and fruits should be rapidly increased.

The centralized storage of commodity meat in 1952 was 2.3 times that of 1948—the first year after the abolition of the rationing system. The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates that meat production should increase by an average of at least 14% each year, and by the end of the five-year period, meat production should increase to twice that of 1940.

In the United States, meat production in 1951 decreased by 437,000 tons compared with 1946, while in the Soviet Union, meat production increased by 709,000 tons during the same period.

It should be pointed out that although meat production in our country has greatly increased, the demand for meat products by residents in many cities has not yet been fully met because demand is increasing faster than production.

Comrade Malenkov said it well that the grain problem has been finally solved. Therefore, we can and must pay special attention to the rapid development of animal husbandry, constantly increasing the number of fattened edible livestock and producing abundant milk. Like the workers in the slaughtering industry, the livestock breeders of state farms and collective farms play a decisive role in increasing meat production.

The amount of fish caught in 1952 almost increased by 70% compared with 1940.

The fishing capacity of the fishing fleet in 1952 reached 3.2 times the pre-war level, and by 1955, it will reach more than 4.5 times the pre-war figure.

Deep-sea fishing now accounts for 66% of the total fish catch, while it only accounted for 46% before the war.

A brave army of sailors has grown up. This group of fishery workers who fight against nature in all climates—whether it is sunny or stormy, snowy or rainy—has created an example of serving the motherland with heroic labor and heroic and courageous spirit. In the recent past, most fishery workers only needed to know how to handle sailboats and fishing nets, but today's fishery workers must be able to operate modern self-propelled seagoing vessels equipped with the latest fishing equipment.

In the past few years after the war, a large number of technicians—captains, navigators, and mechanics—have been trained to operate such ships, although the number of such personnel still cannot keep up with the demand. Currently, we have 12,800 outstanding young people undergoing this kind of vocational training, while in 1940 there were only 740 people.

Although the fish catch in the Murmansk and Baltic fishing grounds has increased considerably, the situation in the Sea of Azov, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, and Far East fishing grounds is still not very good.

The huge task facing the fishing industry is to organize the industrial incubation of fish in the rivers and seas of the Soviet Union. The huge reservoirs built due to the construction of hydraulic engineering projects on the Don River, Volga River, Dnieper River, Kura River, and Amu Darya have made it possible to increase the storage of bream, carp, pike, perch, and other fish due to the proper development of fish sources.

The construction of hydraulic engineering projects has greatly changed the natural conditions for fish reproduction in the Caspian Sea and the Sea of Azov, and has raised the requirement to vigorously develop the industrial method of breeding valuable fish species.

Therefore, it is necessary to establish fish hatcheries and special fish ponds on a large scale.

However, the Ministry of Fisheries is still quite slow in implementing the above-mentioned measures.

Due to the huge plan for constructing fish ponds and the rich output of these fish ponds, collective farm ponds provide great possibilities for increasing fish resources. The work of the fishing grounds in Kursk Oblast, Kiev Oblast, and Krasnodar Krai is a good example. Now there are many fishing grounds in these places that cultivate 1.5 tons to 2 tons of fish per hectare of pond water per year.

It is now entirely possible to guarantee the further improvement of the speed of increasing the fish catch and the speed of increasing the output of high-quality fish products. It is entirely possible not only to complete but also to over fulfill the tasks of the Five-Year Plan and to make the fish catch more than double the pre-war level. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen and establish new coastal bases for fishing fleets, build more fish product processing factories, further mechanize fishing work and fish product processing, and expand the housing of fishery workers.

In 1951, butter production in the United States decreased by 281,000 tons compared with the pre-war year of 1940, while butter production in the Soviet Union increased by 132,000 tons during this period, not including the large amount of home-made butter.

In the last year of this Five-Year Plan, butter production in the Soviet Union will reach 2.7 times the pre-war level, cheese more than three times, and margarine more than three times.

Such a surge in oil production seems to cause us sales difficulties.

But in fact, this is not the case, because the purchasing power of residents is increasing faster than the market supply.

In some areas, the need for oil, especially butter, cannot be fully met.

In 1952, the output of canned food increased to more than twice that of the pre-war year of 1940. By 1955, it will increase to three times, and the output of canned fish and canned meat will increase to more than five times that of 1940.

The production of condensed milk and milk powder plays an increasingly important role in eliminating the seasonal decline in residents' milk supply in winter. In 1952, the output of condensed milk and milk powder had increased to twice that of 1940, and by the end of the Five-Year Plan, it will increase to five times that of 1940.

The damage suffered by the sugar industry during the German occupation was more serious than other sectors of the food industry. Of the 211 sugar factories that started production before the war, 196 were completely or partially destroyed by the war. In 1943, sugar production was only one-twentieth of the pre-war level.

Today, the sugar industry has been restored, and sugar refineries with the latest equipment have been built. In 1952, sugar production will increase by more than 50% compared with 1940, and by the end of the new Five-Year Plan, it will increase to twice the pre-war level.

In the United States, sugar beet production in 1951 decreased by 338,000 tons compared with the previous year, and sugar beet production in France also decreased by 142,000 tons. Sugar beet production in our country increased by 454,000 tons during the same period. Last year, sugar beet production in our country was more than 40% higher than the total sugar beet and cane sugar production in the United States.

In 1952, the sugar beet produced in the Soviet Union will be more than the total output of the United States, France, and Britain. (Applause) It is necessary to continue to expand the planting area of sugar beet, increase its yield per unit area and its sugar content, and continue to expand the sowing area of sunflower and increase its oil content.

In Ukraine, thanks to the collective farms' concern for planting sugar beet and the strong leadership of the Party organization, the sugar beet production in recent years has guaranteed the completion and over fulfillment of the sugar production plan. However, this cannot be said to be the case in some other sugar beet planting areas, especially in the Altai Krai and Kursk Oblast, where everyone's attention to sugar beet is still poor. Although Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan have made some achievements, they still have not fully realized their potential. Last year's output was even lower than before the war.

Naturally, there is no need for me to say that with the improvement of residents' diets, it is also necessary to increase the production of various beverages that can improve appetite. (The atmosphere of the venue becomes lively, laughter, applause.)

In 1952, wine production increased by 39% compared with 1940, and by the completion of the new Five-Year Plan, it will almost increase to more than twice the pre-war level. This year, the production of champagne and high-grade brandy increased to two times, and by the completion of the Five-Year Plan, it will increase to 3.5 times. Beer production has increased by 42%, and by the completion of the Five-Year Plan, it will increase to two times. The production of vodka is now slightly lower than before the war, and it is increasing relatively slowly according to the needs of residents, but it has been increasing all the time. (The atmosphere of the venue becomes lively again, laughter, applause.)

In this Five-Year Plan, special attention should be paid to increasing the production of packaged foods and semi-finished foods.

Not only factory-made foods such as sausages and ice cream, which have been popular for a long time, are popular, but also foods such as ground beef, meatballs, breakfast foods, and canned soups are very popular. The output of these things has increased several times compared with before the war, and there will be more increases by the time this Five-Year Plan is completed.

However, it must be clearly pointed out that these products have so far only been sold on a large scale in some big cities. The problem is to develop the production of these foods in a large number of cities during the period of the new Five-Year Plan. This is not only because these foods are delicious and well-cooked—their quality is tested and guaranteed by health experts and national quality inspectors—but also because this can free our women from heavy labor and allow them to make delicious food at home without spending much time.

Soviet doctors aptly quoted the words of the great scientist Pavlov: "Everyone knows that the normal and hygienic way to eat is: the more you eat, the more you want to eat, and the more enjoyable you eat."

This work not only requires the production of a large amount of food, but also requires these foods to be of high quality, nutritious, beautiful in appearance, fragrant, delicious, and appetizing, so that people can feel that this is a real enjoyment when they eat. (Stormy applause)

The development of the refrigeration industry plays a very important role in improving people's diets and further reducing the rate of food spoilage during storage.

In this regard, we have made many achievements.

Compared with 1940, the total collection capacity of refrigeration factories in the food industry in 1952 increased to more than two times, and by the end of the five-year period, it will increase to nearly four times.

The phenomenon of insufficient supply of machine refrigeration stations in the trade network is being rapidly eliminated.

In 1948, there were 1,650 such refrigeration stations; by 1952, the number had increased to 18,000; by the end of the five-year period, it will increase to 40,000.

Compared with before the war, the number of refrigerated ships mainly used for transporting fish will increase to more than two times in 1952, and by the end of the five-year period, it will increase to more than three times.

The number of refrigerated trucks is now 40% higher than before the war; by 1955, it will increase to twice the pre-war level.

Household refrigerators are very important for preserving food and facilitating residents.

Before the war, we did not produce such refrigerators on a large scale, but now we have three kinds of electric household refrigerators, and their quality is not lower than the best foreign-made refrigerators. These three refrigerators are a small refrigerator manufactured by the "Gazoapparat Factory," a medium-sized refrigerator manufactured by the "Saratov Factory," and a large refrigerator manufactured by the "ZIS Factory."

This year, the output of these refrigerators will increase to twice that of 1951, and by 1955, the output will increase to ten times.

The continuous development of refrigeration methods—from industrial enterprises to the transportation industry, from warehouses and stores to consumers' homes—guarantees that the Soviet people can get hygienic and delicious food; our great party and Comrade Stalin himself have been paying attention to this matter. (Applause)

The task of the relevant departments of the food industry is to eliminate some of the shortcomings in the work of the food industry mentioned in Comrade Malenkov's report; to make full use of the untapped potential; to raise the work of backward enterprises to the level of advanced enterprises and strive to work as well as innovators; to practice economy in the use of money, raw materials, supplies, and in the use of purchasing and sales funds; and to implement the general plan for the mechanization and automation of industry.

The implementation of all the above-mentioned measures will enable the various departments of the food industry to confidently save at least 45 billion rubles in accordance with the provisions of the Five-Year Plan.

The achievements made in increasing food and all consumer goods, as well as the provisions of the new Five-Year Plan on further rapid improvement of the welfare of the masses, are the result of Comrade Stalin's constant concern for Soviet citizens and their welfare. (Applause)

We can confidently say that the workers in the food industry will gloriously fulfill their duties and complete the task set by Comrade Stalin to make our country abundant in products.

In 1952, the retail volume of the national and cooperative trade system will be more than twice that of 1948 (the first year after the abolition of the rationing system)
(calculated at comparable prices).

In recent years, the sales volume of industrial products, especially durable goods—automobiles, motorcycles, bicycles, radios, televisions, furniture, refrigerators, musical instruments, etc.—has greatly increased. This vividly illustrates the improvement of the living standards of the Soviet people. In 1952, the total amount of savings deposits was four times that of 1940, which is another clear indicator of the improvement in people's welfare and people's trust in the Soviet currency.

After a larger number of daily necessities are put on the market, people naturally have stricter requirements for quality and variety. In the past, when the supply of goods was insufficient, they often bought goods even if they were not up to standard. The situation is very different now. But industrial and trade organizations still continue to follow the old ways, failing to properly analyze demand and continuing to ship out a small variety of goods indiscriminately, sometimes shipping a large number of clothes or shoes to an area or a city, with only two or three styles and sizes, three or four kinds of appearances, and not enough variety.

The quality and variety of goods produced by industry for retail should be improved more rapidly. The needs and interests of Soviet consumers should become the law of industry.

The system of trade organizations placing orders with industry in advance must be further developed; this system has fully proven its advantages.

Expanding the network of well-equipped specialized stores is necessary. In larger cities, professional trade organizations should also be established to guide them, as in Moscow and Leningrad.

Proper attention should be paid to more rationally distributing stores by region and adjusting the existing situation. Finally, it is also necessary to adapt the warehouse situation to the constantly increasing sales volume.

The network of public canteens and restaurants must be further expanded, and the work of public catering institutions must also be greatly improved.

The staff of the trade system must improve their business, know what the people need, and know how to sell the goods that customers need to customers. Lenin's motto—learn how to do business—is still valid for the staff of the trade system.

The task of local industries and production cooperatives that supply consumer goods is to improve the quality of their goods, reduce costs, and specialize their production as much as possible; to fully strengthen their enterprise equipment or refit its equipment.

After eliminating the more serious war wounds, the Party and the government immediately created conditions for abolishing the rationing system and gradually reducing the prices of consumer goods.

As a result of following Stalin's policy of reducing prices, the prices of consumer goods have been reduced by a total of 50% in the past five years. In other words, prices have been reduced by half. This means that today, Soviet consumers only need to spend 50 rubles to buy things that they spent 100 rubles to buy five years ago.

The larger the output, the lower the cost, the higher the labor productivity, and the greater the possibility of reducing prices and increasing the welfare of our people.

The interests of the working people and the interests of the socialist country are intertwined, which is the source of strength and power within our socialist society.

When the Soviet Union is systematically reducing prices, the price levels of capitalist countries are constantly rising, as can be seen from the comparison of the following official figures:

1952 price levels of main food items (with prices at the end of 1947 as 100)

		Soviet Union	United States	United Kingdom	France
Bread	39		128		190		208
Meat	42		126		135		188
Butter	37		104		225		192
Milk	72		118		130		174
Sugar	49		106		233		376

From the end of 1947 to 1952, bread prices in the United States rose by 28%, in the United Kingdom by 90%, and in France by more than 100%. In the Soviet Union, during the same period, bread prices decreased by more than 60%.

During this period, meat prices in the United States rose by 26%, in the United Kingdom by 35%, and in France by 88%, while meat prices in the Soviet Union decreased by more than half.

In capitalist countries, the dominant monopolists pursue a policy of raising prices and freezing wages in order to obtain maximum profits, while in the Soviet Union, Stalin's policy ensures the continuous reduction of prices.

In the United Kingdom, the United States, and other capitalist countries, the continuous rise in prices inevitably leads to a decline in the consumption of the working people. The United Kingdom is a vivid example. According to British statistics, the average per capita consumption of main food items in 1951 compared with before the war decreased as follows: meat products by 40%, butter by 40%, canned fish by 46%, rice by 37%, sugar by 16%, tea by 23%, etc. Of course, the decrease in average per capita consumption does not explain much, because, as everyone knows, there is no such thing as average consumption at all. The entire decrease in consumption is entirely the decrease in the consumption of the working class. The British bourgeoisie has not become poorer. It still consumes as much as it wants to consume.

The increasingly crazy expansion of armaments makes the living standards of the working people continue to decline. This is not accidental. Neither the British Conservatives nor the Labor Party hypocrites—a pair of lackeys of the American imperialists—can even make promises to British workers to improve their current situation, nor even promise to improve their future situation. All they can do is, together with their pastors, promise the British workers a paradise in another world. (Laughter, applause)

This is an irony and a trick of fate: the British government happened to start raising food prices again on October 5, the day our congress opened, which is the latest blow to the lives of the British working people.

In the past few years after the war, the Soviet Union's foreign trade, like its entire national economy, has had a new upsurge.

Before the war, due to the Soviet Union's isolation, foreign trade failed to gradually increase. The situation after the war was different. The Soviet Union's foreign trade volume increased year by year: this was due to the consolidation of the Soviet Union's international status, the emergence of a new world market, and the strengthening of our economic strength.

At present, the Soviet Union's foreign trade volume is three times that of before the war.

After the war, the Soviet Union still adhered to its unchanging policy: developing trade relations with capitalist countries on a mutually beneficial basis.

After a certain prosperity in trade with capitalist countries in the first few years after the war, it has drastically declined due to the United States' aggressive policy. This reduction has been more than compensated for by the increase in trade with friendly countries.

Any capitalist country that is willing to develop trade relations with the Soviet Union on mutually beneficial terms has always received support from our side. Our trade with Finland is a vivid example. The trade volume between the Soviet Union and Finland in 1951, calculated at comparable prices, was nine times that of 1938.

The long-term trade agreement concluded from 1951 to 1955 requires further expansion of trade. In this way, the trade volume in 1953 will almost be twice that of 1951; that is to say, in two years, the trade volume will almost double.

The biggest change in our country's trade after the war is that most of our country's foreign trade is now conducted with countries in the democratic camp. This year, these countries will account for 80% of our country's foreign trade.

Comrade Stalin taught us: "The economic result of the existence of two opposing camps is that the single, all-encompassing world market has collapsed, so we now have two parallel world markets that are also opposed to each other."

Among the countries of the democratic camp, that is, in the new world market, economic cooperation is developing on the solid basis of their planned economic development and the comradely coordination of national economic plans; it is based on the equality of the people of large and small countries and mutual benefit and assistance in economic development. Because these countries sincerely care about the victories of other countries, there is no room for destructive competition between them.

Trade between countries in the peaceful democratic camp has increased more than twofold from 1948 to 1952; even if the reduction in trade between countries in the peaceful democratic camp and capitalist countries is taken into account, the total amount of foreign trade of the peaceful democratic camp has still doubled.

The resources possessed by the market of the democratic camp enable each country to find in the new world market all kinds of goods needed to develop its own economy. In addition, each country imports the goods it needs and exports the goods needed by other countries. No country forces other countries to accept things that people do not need, as in the capitalist market.

The mutual conclusion of long-term economic agreements by countries in the democratic camp has brought cooperation between countries into a new stage. The conclusion of long-term economic agreements is possible because countries in the people's democratic camp have been successively implementing long-term plans. Long-term trade agreements ensure that countries receive a continuous supply of machine equipment, raw materials, and other goods needed to develop their economies over a long period of time; these plans also guarantee the sales of products and enable the people to clearly see the prospects for further economic development, thereby generating confidence.

The rapid consolidation of the peaceful democratic camp politically and economically is due to Comrade Stalin's far-sighted policy and his daily concern for strengthening the brotherly friendship between the Soviet Union and the people of the democratic camp. (Applause)

In 1952, the latest machinery and equipment transported by the Soviet Union to the people's democratic countries was equivalent to ten times that of 1948.

The Soviet Union supplies the people's democratic countries with the latest equipment, enabling them to receive first-class technical assistance at the lowest cost, and allows them to use Soviet patents, licenses, and production technology for free.

All this enables the people's democratic countries to develop various new factories and all industrial sectors, and to install many new machines that they would never be able to obtain under other conditions.

Take Romania as an example: Romania has greatly expanded oil production, and now also has a growing machine manufacturing industry. With the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, it is manufacturing almost all the equipment necessary for oil production, and it is beginning to manufacture complex oil refining equipment. A small country with abundant oil resources and its own oil machine manufacturing industry is a unique example in the world. Those Latin American and Middle Eastern countries whose large amounts of oil have been drained by the Anglo-American monopoly capital groups through piracy dare not even dream of such a thing.

Due to the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, economic relations between countries in the world capitalist market are in a terrible state of collapse. This state of collapse is further aggravated by the United States' pursuit of a policy of foreign expansionism in its desperate struggle for world hegemony. American imperialism is desperately trying to seize markets, attempting to reconcile the internal contradictions of its own economy by increasing exports. The United States wants to sell a large number of goods to other countries, but only buys very few goods. This can be seen very clearly from the fact that since the end of the war, the United States has exported an average of 12.5 billion U.S. dollars per year and imported 7.3 billion U.S. dollars; thus, the United States has an average annual trade surplus of 5 billion U.S. dollars.

The economic absurdity of this trade is fully manifested in the trade between the United States and Western Europe: since the end of the war, the Americans have exported a total of 4 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods to Western Europe each year, while importing only 1 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods from Europe, using high tariff barriers to prevent European goods from entering their country.

When the sales of American goods in Western Europe are equivalent to four times the amount of American purchases in Western Europe, can trade still develop? No, this trade will inevitably further cause the international capitalist market to collapse and make the contradictions between the various countries in the bourgeois world more acute. The United States has been using all means of commercial warfare, including dumping on an unprecedented scale, to implement this foreign expansion, with the aim of harming the interests of Britain, France, and other capitalist countries; the United States is pushing these countries out of the world market, and even driving Britain and France out of their own colonies.

All forms of "assistance" from the United States to other countries are purely a smokescreen for intensifying plunder and exploitation of other countries.

After defeated West Germany and Japan return to the world market, it will further sharpen the contradictions between the defeated countries and those countries that seized their markets after the war.

Under the conditions after the war, the imperialist countries further strengthened unequal trade with the dependent countries, buying their raw materials and food cheaply, and selling their own goods to them at exorbitant prices. For example, the United States packaged copper from Chile, tin from Bolivia, oil from Venezuela, coffee from Brazil, and rubber from Asian countries at extremely low prices, thus causing fierce protests and replacing governments controlled by the United States. For example, American monopolists earn more than thirteen U.S. dollars in profits on every ton of oil produced in Saudi Arabia, which is equivalent to seven times the actual cost of oil. They also seized a lot of profits in other countries in the Middle East, while the people of these countries live in poverty and ignorance.

The dominant imperialist countries are suffocating the economies of backward countries, turning them into agricultural and raw material appendages and markets for their unsalable goods. The abnormal nature of the international division of labor in capitalist countries is thus further deepened.

In contrast to this situation, a new world market is growing and developing on a sound basis. This market is based on the fraternal relations between the countries of the democratic camp and their common interests, which guarantees a rational division of labor between them and the planned, crisis-free development of their national economies according to their natural resources and economic potential.

Comrades! It is difficult to summarize and properly evaluate all the great achievements that our country is going to report to the 19th Party Congress. The hearts of all progressive people in the world are filled with immense joy for the great Soviet Union and for the rapidly developing and strengthening camp of peace and democracy.

Our achievements have enraged the mortal enemies of mankind, the monopoly capitalists who are preparing military aggression and are taking provocative and threatening actions against the Soviet Union and the entire democratic camp. Our congress has declared very clearly and firmly: we are not afraid of any provocation and intimidation, we are striving for peace, and we are fully prepared to cope with any danger and give the aggressors a devastating counterattack. (Applause)

After the 19th Party Congress, our country, under the leadership of our leader and teacher, the great architect of communism, our own beloved Comrade Stalin, will move more calmly and confidently towards the victory of communism! (Stormy applause)

Glory to the great Stalin! (Stormy and prolonged applause) (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th (TASS dispatch))

    米高扬在苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会十月九日会议上的发言
    同志们！
    党中央委员会的报告，关于第五个五年计划的草案、关于党章的修正草案以及在代表大会召开前夕发表的斯大林同志关于苏联社会主义经济问题的天才著作，照亮了只有斯大林的天才光芒才能照亮的、已经走过的具有伟大历史意义的道路，以及通往轮廓日益清晰的共产主义社会的道路。
    当我们的强大的党召开第十九次代表大会之际，我们应该向培育我们、组织我们、领导我们通过各种困难和考验而且正满怀信心地领导着我们走向共产主义完全胜利的人、共产主义的伟大建筑师斯大林致敬。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    在斯大林关于苏联社会主义经济问题的新著作中，在这个思想宝库中，具有特殊意义的是斯大林同志所发现的并明确地加以规定的社会主义的基本经济法则和现代资本主义的基本经济法则。
    现代资本主义的基本经济法则的本质是通过人对人的剥削以保证最大限度的利润。与此相反，社会主义的基本经济法则的本质是用在最高技术基础上不断发展和改进社会主义生产的方法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    斯大林同志同时指出了国民经济的有计划的、成比例的发展的重要的、但不是基本的法则，对于我们的重大意义。他指出，这个法则只有根据基本的社会主义经济法则，才能得到充分的应用。
    斯大林同志发现了客观的社会主义经济法则的本质，从而进一步巩固了我们的党，加强了党的政策的科学基础。
    斯大林同志及时地在那些被我们的伟大胜利冲昏了头脑的同志们的头上浇了一阵冷水。这些人得出结论说现在客观的经济法则不再有用了，现在的法则是他们制定的了，事实上这使得他们进入了唯心主义哲学的领域，在经济政策上成了冒险主义。
    斯大林同志彻底揭露了某些同志的混乱思想：他们中有些人认为价值法则在社会主义下根本没有用了；有一些人则把价值法则的应用原封不动地搬到社会主义、实际上是共产主义的实际里去。
    斯大林同志明晰地、清楚地指出，只要商品生产继续下去，价值法则就将继续在我们国家发生作用。但是这个法则应用的领域是有严格的限制，而且是置于一定的范围内的，因为我们的商品生产是一种特别的商品生产，它的应用范围限于个人消费的物品。
    斯大林同志的新著作给予我们一个概念，说明了关于从社会主义到共产主义的逐渐过渡、建立共产主义的物质和技术基础、消灭城乡之间的主要差别和脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的主要差别的主要问题。斯大林同志指出了，我们的商品流通的基础在于社会主义所有制——全民所有制和集体农场集团所有制——两种形式的差异，他叙述了把集体农场所有制提高到全民所有制的水平的方法，在这样的基础上，商品流通将逐渐地为产品交换制所代替。同时这也会使得价值法则和商品经济的其他因素终止其作用。
    斯大林同志指出，由于我们以国家与植棉、种麻、种甜菜的集体农场和种植其他作物的集体农场订立合同的方法实行“供给”农产品，产品交换的萌芽已经有了。按照他的计划，应该在农业的一切部门中组织这些萌芽的方式，并把它们发展为产品交换的广大体系，以便使集体农场因交出自己的产品不仅取得货币，而主要是取得它们所需要的制成品，因为制成品是储积起来并且在国家手里的。因此从事城乡之间的交换的采购和贸易机构的工作必须大大地予以改组。
    斯大林同志指示：必须“把集体农场生产的剩余物从商品流通的系统中消除掉，把它们列入国家工业和集体农场之间的产品交换制度中”，无需特别急忙但是应该一贯地毫不犹豫地，一步一步地缩小商品流通的活动范围，扩大产品交换的活动范围，把集体农场生产的剩余物纳入国家计划的系统中，或者换句话说就是准备逐渐过渡到共产主义的劳动生产品的分配方式。
    实践已经证明，“产品供给”对集体农场是有好处的，因此，在全国所有的集体农场实行产品交换制度将使集体农场农民得到很大的好处。
    在世界历史和我国历史的现阶段中，不能想像我们可以不充分领会斯大林同志给马克思—列宁主义科学带来的、关于社会发展的法则和道路的新学说而生活、建设和斗争。（掌声）
    斯大林同志用科学的光辉照亮了我们的生活，给予我们一个行动纲领，并指导我们胜利地走向共产主义。
    斯大林同志教导我们：“只有在比资本主义制度下还要高的高度劳动生产率的基础上，在产品和各种消费品丰足的基础上，在社会一切成员都能过富裕的有文化的生活的基础上，社会主义才可胜利建成。”
    我们的党已经大大提高了一般消费品和粮食的产量。
    新五年计划规定继续大大发展轻工业和食品工业。
    我们的食品工业发展的一个特点是，更有价值的食品的产量增加得更加迅速。这完全符合于我们人民的不断增长的需要。我国的肉类、牛奶产品、鱼类、蔬菜、水果、食糖和其他产品的生产量和消费量正在迅速增加，因此，面包产量增加的速度就比较缓慢了。
    同样地，廉价棉织品的需要已经减少而高等毛织品、丝织品、人造丝织品和质地精美的棉织品的需要则增加了。
    家庭所需的食盐、火柴和煤油的产量已能完全满足需要，因此这些物品的生产就不用怎样提高了。这真是了不起，记得不久以前，向农村供应这些商品的问题还需要予以特别注意呢。
    消费水平提高，就需要大大增加小麦面包的产量而减少裸麦面包的产量。小麦面包和小麦面包卷的产量在一九五二年为一九四零年的产量的两倍，并且还要继续增加。
    巨大面包厂焙制的面包正迅速增加，逐渐代替了小规模的面包房和家庭焙制的面包。
    下面的数字可以说明这一点：在一九三六年有三百五十三座城市所食用的面包是以工业生产的方式供应的，到了一九五二年，这个数目已经增加到一千一百零四座，就是说比一九三六年多了七百五十一座。我们的焙制工业正在广大规模上转入机械化和自动化。主要生产过程有百分之七十八到百分之九十八都已机械化和自动化，到五年的时期终了时，这种生产过程都将是百分之百的机械化和自动化。
    五年计划规定在没有足够的面包焙制工厂的地区建筑大量的新的面包焙制工厂。现在仍然有这样的地区。
    焙制工业的负责人员的任务是：在各个城市里增加面包和其它焙制品的种类，改进面包和其它焙制品的滋味和营养价值，把生产效率提高到莫斯科和列宁格勒的第一流面包焙制工厂的水平；至于这两个城市则再向前进。
    菜蔬和马铃薯的干制在我们国家内是相当落后的。在斯大林同志的创议下，采用了关于建筑干制马铃薯和菜蔬的现代化工厂的庞大计划；到五年时期终了的时候，它们的总生产能力将使得每年干制一百一十万吨的生马铃薯和菜蔬成为可能。这样保证能够把马铃薯和菜蔬运到苏联的北部和其它边远地区去，并保证在全年的所有季节里，不间断地供应这些东西给全体人民。
    五年计划也规定新鲜的、冷藏的菜蔬和水果的产量要迅速增加。
    商品肉类的集中储藏量，一九五二年为一九四八年——配给制废除以后的第一年——的二点三倍。第五个五年计划规定：肉类产量每年平均至少要增加百分之十四，而到五年时期终了时，肉类产量要增加为一九四○年的两倍。
    在美国，一九五一年的肉类产量比一九四六年减少了四十三万七千吨，而在苏联，肉类产量却在同一时期增加了七十万零九千吨。
    应当指出，虽然我国肉类产量大大增加，但许多城市的居民对肉类产品的需求仍未充分满足，因为需求比产量增加得快。
    马林科夫同志说得很好，谷物问题已经最后解决了，因此，我们就能够而且必须特别注意迅速发展牲畜饲养业，不断地增加肥壮的食用牲畜的数目并生产丰足的牛奶。和屠宰业的工人一样，国家农场和集体农场的牲畜饲养员在增加肉类产量方面有决定的作用。
    捕鱼量在一九五二年比一九四○年几乎增加了百分之七十。
    一九五二年的渔船队的捕鱼能力达到战前的三点二倍，而到一九五五年，它将达到战前数字的四点五倍以上。
    深海捕鱼量现在占总捕鱼量的百分之六十六，而在战前只占百分之四十六。
    一支勇猛的海员大军已经成长起来。这一批在一切气候下——不论是晴朗的天气还是暴风雨，也不论是冰雪还是雨天——对自然进行斗争的渔业工人，创立了以英雄的劳动和英勇果敢的精神为祖国服务的范例。在不久前的过去，大部分渔业工人所需要具备的一切条件只不过是知道如何掌握帆船和渔网而已，而今天的渔业工人则必须要能够操纵装配有最新捕鱼工具的现代自动推进的航海船只了。
    在战后几年中为了操纵这样的船只已训练了大批的技术人员——船长、领航员和机械师，虽然这种人员的数目仍然赶不上需要。目前，我们有一万二千八百名优秀青年正在受这种职业训练，而一九四零年却只是七百四十人。
    虽然摩尔曼斯克和波罗的海渔场捕鱼量增加颇多，可是亚速海、黑海、里海和远东渔场的情况却仍不太好。
    渔业所面对的巨大任务是：在苏联各河海里组织鱼类的工业孵化。由于在顿河、伏尔加河、第聂伯河、库拉河和阿姆河上进行水力工程的建设而建成的巨大水库使得鱼类来源有了适当的发展，因而可能增加鲷鱼、鲤鱼、梭鱼、鲈鱼和其他鱼类的储存量。
    水力工程的建设大大地改变了里海和亚速海鱼类繁殖的天然条件，并提出了尽力发展有价值鱼种的工业方式繁殖的要求。
    因此，必须大规模地建立鱼类孵卵处和特种养鱼塘。
    可是，渔业部在执行上述措施时还颇为拖沓。
    由于建设养鱼塘的巨大计划和这些养鱼塘的丰富的出产，集体农场的池塘为增加鱼产资源，提供了很大的可能性。库尔斯克州、基辅州和克拉斯诺达边疆区的渔场的工作便是很好的例子，现在这些地方有许多渔场，它们在一年内每一公顷的水塘培养出一点五吨到两吨的鱼。
    现在完全有可能保证进一步提高捕鱼量增加的速度和优等鱼产品产量增加的速度，完全有可能不仅完成而且超额完成五年计划的任务并使捕鱼量达到战前的两倍多。因此必须加强并建立供捕鱼船队之用的新的海岸基地，增建鱼品加工工厂，使捕鱼工作与鱼品的加工更加机械化，并扩充渔业工人的住宅。
    一九五一年美国的牛油产量和战前一九四○年比较减少了二十八万一千吨，而这一时期苏联牛油的产量却增加了十三万二千吨，其中还不包括大宗的家庭制造的牛油。
    在这个五年计划的最后的一年，苏联的牛油产量将达到战前的二点七倍，奶酪三倍多，人造牛油三倍多。
    油脂产量的这样的激增似乎会给我们造成销售的困难。
    但是事实上却不然，因为居民的购买力比市场的供应增加得更迅速。
    在有些区内，油脂特别是牛油的需要还不能全部得到满足。
    一九五二年罐头食品的产量增为战前一九四零年的二倍以上。到一九五五年将增为三倍，罐头鱼和罐头肉的产量将增为一九四零年的五倍以上。
    炼乳和奶粉的生产在消除冬季的居民牛奶供应的季节性下降方面，起了越来越大的作用。在一九五二年，炼乳和奶粉的产量已增为一九四零年的二倍，到五年计划末尾将增为一九四零年的五倍。
    制糖工业在德国占领期间所受的创伤，比较食品工业的其他部门更为严重。在战前开工生产的二百一十一个制糖工厂中，有一百九十六个工厂全部或部分地毁于战火，一九四三年食糖的生产量仅为战前水平的二十分之一。
    今天制糖工业已经恢复，拥有最新式设备的炼糖厂已经修建起来了。一九五二年食糖的产量将较一九四零年增加百分之五十以上，到新的五年计划终了时，将增加为战前的两倍。
    在美国，甜菜糖的产量在一九五一年较前一年减少了三十三万八千吨，法国的甜菜糖的产量也减少了十四万二千吨，我国的甜菜糖的产量在同一时期却增加了四十五万四千吨。去年我国甜菜糖的产量比美国的甜菜糖与蔗糖产量的总和还多了百分之四十以上。
    一九五二年苏联生产的甜菜糖将比美、法、英三国产量的总和还要多。（掌声）必须继续扩大甜菜的种植面积，增加它的单位面积产量和它的含糖量，必须继续扩大向日葵的播种面积和增加它的含油量。
    在乌克兰，由于集体农场对种植甜菜的关心，由于党组织的有力领导，最近几年来的甜菜产量保证了产糖计划的完成和超额完成。不过在其他某些种植甜菜的地区就不能说是这样，特别是阿尔泰边疆区与库尔斯克州，在那里大家对甜菜的注意还差。吉尔吉斯和哈萨克虽然有了一些成绩，可是仍然没有发挥它们全部的潜力，去年的产量甚至比战前还低。
    自然用不着我说，随着居民的膳食的改善，也就必须增加能够增进食欲的各种饮料的产量。（会场气氛活跃起来，笑声，掌声。）
    一九五二年葡萄酒的产量比一九四○年增加百分之三十九，到新五年计划完成时将差不多增加到战前水平的两倍以上。今年香槟和上等白兰地酒的产量增加到两倍，到五年计划完成时将增加到三点五倍。啤酒的产量已增加百分之四十二，到五年计划完成时将增加到两倍。伏特加酒的产量现在比战前稍低，照居民的需求来说，增加得比较慢，不过也一直在增加着。（会场气氛又活跃起来，笑声，掌声。）
    在这个五年计划中应该特别注意增加包装食品和半制成食品的产量。
    不仅是很久以来就很普遍的腊肠和冰淇淋这类工厂制造的食品受到欢迎，而且像碎牛排、肉汤团、早餐食物、罐头汤这类食品也十分受欢迎了，这些东西的产量比战前增加了好几倍，到这个五年计划完成的时候还要有更多的增加。
    然而必须明白指出，这种产品迄今为止还只是在一些大城市里才大规模地销售。问题是要在新五年计划的期间内，在大批的城市里发展这些食物的生产，这样做不仅是因为这些食物味美可口，烹调精美——它们的质量是经过卫生专家和国家质量检查员的检验，并得到他们的保证的——，而且因为这样能够使得我们的妇女摆脱繁重的劳动，使她们能够在家庭条件下不花费许多时间，就能作出可口的食物。
    苏联医生十分恰当地援引伟大的科学家巴甫洛夫的话说：“每个人都知道正常的、适合卫生的吃法是：越吃越想吃，吃得津津有味。”
    这项工作不仅要求制成大量的食物，而且这些食物必须质量高、有营养，必须外表漂亮、香味扑鼻，滋味美好、增进食欲，使得人民在吃的时候能感到这是一种真正的享受。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    发展冷藏工业，对于改进人民的膳食和进一步减少食品在储藏期间的腐坏率有着十分重大的作用。
    在这一方面，我们已经有了许多成就。
    与一九四○年相比，食品工业中冷藏工厂的全部收藏能力在一九五二年增加到两倍多，到五年时期终了时，将增加到四倍弱。
    贸易网中机器冷藏站的供不应求的现象，正在迅速消灭中。
    在一九四八年，这种冷藏站有一千六百五十个；到了一九五二年，就增加到一万八千个；到五年时期终了时，将增加到四万个。
    与战前相比，主要为运鱼用的冷藏船，在一九五二年将增加到两倍多，到五年时期终了时，将增加到三倍多。
    现在冷藏车的数目比战前增加了百分之四十；到一九五五年将增加到战前的两倍。
    家用冷藏器对于保存食品，使居民得到方便，是十分重要的。
    在战前，我们未曾大规模生产这种冷藏器，但是现在我们有三种电气家用冷藏器，其质量并不低于最好的外国制造的冷藏器。这三种冷藏器是“加左阿巴特工厂”制造的一种小型冷藏器，“萨拉托夫工厂”制造的一种中型冷藏器，和“吉斯工厂”制造的一种大型冷藏器。
    今年这些冷藏器的产量将增加到一九五一年的两倍，到一九五五年，产量将增加到十倍。
    冷藏法的不断发展——从工业企业发展到运输业，从仓库和商店发展到消费者的家庭——保证苏联人民可以得到卫生可口的食品；我们伟大的党和斯大林同志本人一直都在注意这件事情。（掌声）
    食品工业各部门有关各部的任务是，消灭马林科夫同志报告中提到的食品工业工作中的一些缺点；充分利用尚未利用的潜力；把落后企业的工作提高到先进企业的水平并力求工作得像革新者一样的好；在使用金钱、原料、供应品以及使用购货和售货基金时实行节约；实行使工业机械化和自动化的总的计划。
    实行上述所有的措施，将使食品工业各部门有把握地按照五年计划的规定，至少节省四百五十亿卢布。
    在增加食品以及所有消费品方面所取得的成绩，以及新的五年计划关于进一步迅速提高群众福利的规定，都是斯大林同志经常关怀苏联公民和他们的福利的结果。（掌声）
    我们可以满怀信心地说：食品工业的工人将光荣地尽到他们的职责，完成斯大林同志所规定的要使我国产品丰足的任务。
    一九五二年国家和合作社贸易系统的零售量将为一九四八年（取消配给制后的第一年）的二倍以上
    （按比较价格计算）。
    近几年来，工业品特别是耐用品——汽车、机器脚踏车、自行车、无线电、电视机、家具、冷藏器、乐器等等——的销售量已大大增加。这一点生动地说明了苏联人民生活水平的提高。一九五二年储蓄存款的总数为一九四零年的四倍，这是人民福利提高和人民信任苏联货币的又一明证。
    在更大量的日用品应市以后，人民对于质量和种类的要求自然更加严格。以前，当货物供应不足的时候，即使是货色不够标准，他们也常常把货品买去。现在的情况大不相同了。但是工业和贸易组织仍然继续着老一套的做法，没有适当地分析需求，而继续把种类无几的货物毫无区别地运出，有时候运了大量衣服或鞋子到一个区或是一个城市去，其中只有两三种式样和尺码，三四种样子，种类也不够多。
    工业为零售而生产的货物的质量和种类，应该更加迅速地改进。苏联消费者的需要和兴趣应该成为工业的法律。
    贸易组织向工业先期订货的制度必须进一步地发展；这个制度已经充分证明了它的优点。
    扩大设备良好的专门商店网是必要的，在比较大的城市里，还应该像莫斯科和列宁格勒一样设立专业贸易机关来指导它们。
    应该适当地注意更加合理地按地区来分布商店并调整现有情况。而最后还有必要使货栈情况适应不断增加的销售量。
    公共食堂和餐厅网必须进一步地扩充，而公共膳食机构的工作也必须大大改善。
    贸易系统的工作人员必须改进他们的业务，要知道人民需要什么，知道怎样向顾客销售顾客所需要的货物。列宁的格言——学习如何做生意——对贸易系统的工作人员仍然是有效的。
    供应消费品的地方工业和生产合作社的任务是：改善他们的货物的质量，降低成本，尽可能使他们的生产专门化；充分加强他们的企业的设备或改装其设备。
    党和政府在消灭了较严重的战争创伤后，就立刻为废除配给制和有步骤地减低消费品价格，创造了条件。
    由于遵循了斯大林减低物价政策的结果，最近五年消费品价格一共减低了百分之五十，换句话说，物价降低了一半。这就是说，今天苏联消费者要买五年前他花一百卢布买来的东西，只需要出五十卢布。
    产量愈大，成本愈低，劳动生产率愈高，降低物价和增加我国人民福利的可能性就愈大。
    劳动人民的利益和社会主义国家的利益打成一片，这就是我们社会主义社会内部力量与威力的源泉。
    当苏联正在有步骤地减低物价的时候，资本主义国家的物价水平却不断地上升，这可以从下面的官方数字的比较中看出：
    一九五二年主要食品价格水平（以一九四七年年底的价格为一百）
    苏联  美国  英国  法国
    面包三九  一二八  一九○  二○八
    肉类  四二  一二六  一三五  一八八
    牛油  三七  一○四  二二五  一九二
    牛奶  七二  一一八  一三○    一七四
    糖  四九  一○六  二三三  三七六
    从一九四七年年底到一九五二年，美国面包价格上涨百分之二十八，英国百分之九十，法国百分之一百还多，而在苏联，同一时期中，面包的价格却减低了百分之六十还多。
    在这个时期中，美国肉类的价格上涨了百分之二十六，英国百分之三十五，法国百分之八十八，而苏联肉类的价格则减低了一半多。
    在资本主义国家中，占统治地位的垄断资本家为了得到最大限度的利润，奉行着提高物价和冻结工资的政策，而在苏联，斯大林政策保证了物价的不断减低。
    在英国、美国和其他资本主义国家中，物价的不断上涨不可避免地引起劳动人民的消费的下降。英国是一个生动的例子。根据英国的统计，一九五一年按人口计算每人平均主要食品消费量和战前比较，下降情况如下：肉类品百分之四十，牛油百分之四十，罐头鱼类百分之四十六，大米百分之三十七，糖百分之十六，茶叶百分之二十三等等。当然，每人平均消费量的降低并不能说明很多问题，因为，大家都知道，根本没有所谓平均消费量，整个消费量的降低完全是降低工人阶级的消费。英国资产阶级并没有变穷，它仍然要消费多少就消费多少。
    越来越疯狂的扩张军备使得劳动人民的生活水平不断下降。这不是偶然的，不论是英国保守党，还是工党伪善者——美帝国主义者的一对仆从——都甚至不能对英国工人作改善他们现在境况的诺言，连答应改善他们将来的境况也没有。他们所能做的是与他们的牧师在一起，答应在另一个世界上，给英国工人一个天堂。（大笑声，掌声）
    这是一个讽刺，也是命运的恶作剧：英国政府恰巧在我们的代表大会开幕的那一天十月五日开始再一次提高食物的价格，这是对英国劳动人民的生活的最近一次打击。
    战后数年中，苏联的对外贸易像它的整个国民经济一样，有着新的高涨。
    战前由于苏联的孤立，对外贸易未能逐渐增加，战后的情况不同了，苏联的对外贸易量一年比一年增加：这是由于苏联的国际地位的巩固，一个新的世界市场的出现以及我们的经济力量的加强。
    目前苏联的对外贸易量为战前的三倍。
    在战后，苏联仍然恪守它的不变的政策：在互惠基础上，发展与资本主义国家的贸易关系。
    与资本主义国家的贸易经过战后最初几年的某种兴旺后，由于美国的侵略政策，已经剧烈地下降了。这种减少由于与友好国家的贸易的增加，已得到绰绰有余的弥补。
    凡是愿意和苏联在互利的条件下发展贸易关系的资本主义国家，一向是得到我国方面的支持的。我们和芬兰的贸易就是一个生动的例子。苏联与芬兰之间一九五一年的贸易额，如以比较价格计算，就为一九三八年九倍。
    而已经缔结的一九五一年到一九五五年的长期贸易协定则要求进一步地扩大贸易。这样一九五三年贸易额差不多将为一九五一年的两倍；就是说，二年的时间，贸易额就差不多增加了一倍。
    我国战后贸易方面最大的变化是：我国对外贸易大部分现在是和民主阵营的各国进行的。今年这些国家在我国的对外贸易中所占的比例将为百分之八十。
    斯大林同志教导我们说：“两个对立阵营存在之经济结果就是：单一的、无所不包的世界市场瓦解了，因而我们现在有两个也是互相对立的平行的世界市场。”
    在民主阵营各个国家之间，就是说在新的世界市场上，经济合作正在它们经济有计划的发展和国民经济计划的同志般的配合的坚固基础上发展着；它是建立在大小国家人民一律平等及在经济发展方面互利互助的基础上的。因为这些国家都诚恳地互相关心着其他国家的胜利，所以这里就没有彼此间进行破坏性竞争的余地。
    和平民主阵营各国之间的贸易从一九四八年到一九五二年已增加了二倍以上；即使把和平民主阵营各国与资本主义各国的贸易削减的情况计算在内，和平民主阵营的对外贸易总额还是增加了一倍。
    民主阵营的市场所拥有的资源能使每个国家在新的世界市场中找到发展本国经济所需的各种物品。此外，每个国家输入本国所需要的物品，向外输出其他国家所需要的物品，没有一个国家强使他国接受人家所不需要的东西，像资本主义市场那样。
    民主阵营各国相互缔结长期经济协定，已使各国之间的合作进入一个新阶段。缔结长期经济协定所以有可能，是因为人民民主阵营各国已在相继实行长期计划。长期的贸易协定保证各国在长时期内得到源源不绝的机器装备、原料及发展经济所需的其他物品的供应；这些计划还能保证产品的销售，并使人民清楚地看到经济进一步发展的远景从而产生信心。
    和平民主阵营在政治上和经济上迅速巩固，应归功于斯大林同志眼光远大的政策，以及他对于加强苏联与民主阵营各国的兄弟人民友谊的日常关怀。
    （掌声）
    一九五二年苏联运送给各人民民主国家的最新式的机器和设备相当于一九四八年的十倍。
    苏联以最新的设备供给各人民民主国家，使他们得到第一流的技术援助而仅付最低代价，并且准许他们免费利用苏联的专利权、特许证和生产技术。
    这一切就使各人民民主国家能够发展各种新的工厂和一切工业部门，装置许多在别的条件下他们决不能够得到的新的机器。
    试以罗马尼亚为例：罗马尼亚已大大扩展了石油生产，现在并且拥有日益成长的机器制造工业，凭借苏联的兄弟援助，在制造着石油生产所必需的差不多一切设备，而且开始制造复杂的炼油设备了。一个小国拥有丰饶的石油资源，又拥有自己的石油机器制造工业，这是全世界唯一无二的榜样。那些被英美垄断资本集团以海盗手段汲干其大量石油的拉丁美洲各国和中东各国，连做梦也不敢想到这样的事。
    由于资本主义的总危机日益加深，世界资本主义市场上各国之间的经济关系陷于可怕的破裂状态。由于美国在拚命争取世界霸权中推行着对外扩张主义的政策，这种破裂状态更加恶化了。美帝国主义拚命努力攫夺市场，企图以增加输出的办法来调和本国经济的内在矛盾。美国要向别的国家抛售大量货物，而仅购进极少货物。首先从下面的事实中可以看得很清楚：自从战争结束以来，美国平均每年输出达一百二十五亿美元，输入达七十三亿美元；由此可见，美国平均每年出超达五十亿美元。
    这种贸易在经济上的荒谬性，充分表现在美国与西欧的贸易上：自从战争结束以来，美国人每年向西欧输出共值四十亿美元的货物，而自欧洲输入仅值十亿美元的货物，用高额关税壁垒阻止欧洲货物输入他们的国家。
    当美国货在西欧的销售额相当于美国在西欧购货额的四倍之多的时候，贸易还能够发展吗？不能够的，这种贸易必然会更进一步使国际资本主义市场陷于瓦解，使资产阶级世界各国之间的矛盾更加尖锐化。美国一直在利用商业战争的一切手段，包括空前规模的倾销，实行这种对外扩张，其目的在于损害英、法及其他资本主义国家的利益；美国正在把这些国家推出世界市场，甚至把英国和法国逐出它们自己的殖民地。
    美国对其他国家一切形式的“援助”，纯粹是加紧掠夺和剥削其他国家的一种烟幕。
    战败的西德和日本回到世界市场上以后，将使战败国家与战后夺取它们市场的那些国家之间的矛盾进一步尖锐化。
    在战后的情况下，帝国主义国家进一步加强和附庸国家的不平等的贸易，以廉价购买它们的原料和食品，而把自己的货物以过高的价格卖给它们。例如，美国以极低廉的价格包购智利的铜、玻利维亚的锡、委内瑞拉的石油、巴西的咖啡和亚洲国家的橡胶，因而引起猛烈的抗议和更换美国所控制的政府。又例如，美国垄断资本家们在沙特阿拉伯出产的每一吨石油上得到十三块美元以上的利润，相当于石油的实际成本的七倍。在中东其他国家，他们也攫取到不少的利润，而这些国家的人民则过着贫穷愚昧的生活。
    占支配地位的帝国主义国家正在窒息落后国家的经济，把它们变成农业和原料的附庸及它们的滞销的货物的市场。资本主义国家国际分工的不正常的性质从而进一步深刻化了。
    和这种情形相对，一个新的世界市场正在一个健全的基础上成长和发展着，这一个市场以民主阵营各国间的兄弟关系和它们的共同利益作为基础，这保证它们之间实行合理的分工并且按照它们的自然资源和经济潜力，有计划地、没有危机地发展它们的国民经济。
    同志们！要综述和适当地评价我们国家所要向第十九次党代表大会报告的一切巨大的成就，是一件困难的事。全世界一切进步人民的心里都为伟大的苏联、为迅速发展与加强的和平与民主阵营感到无比的欢欣。
    我们的成就使人类的死敌、正在准备军事侵略、正在对苏联及整个民主阵营采取挑衅和恫吓手段的垄断资本大亨们恼羞成怒。我们的代表大会已经非常明确而坚定地宣布：我们不怕任何挑衅和恐吓，我们正为和平而努力，我们有充分准备应付任何危险并给与侵略者以毁灭性的还击。（鼓掌）
    在第十九次党代表大会以后，我们国家在我们的领袖和导师、伟大的共产主义建筑师、我们自己的亲爱的斯大林同志领导下，将要更沉着地、更有信心地向着共产主义胜利迈进！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    光荣归于伟大的斯大林！（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科十二日电）
