The People and the People's Liberation Army on the Tibetan Plateau
	Cao Shujing
	Spring in Lhasa
	In Lhasa in May, the sky is always clear. The golden roof of the thirteen-story Potala Palace shines brightly in the sun. The highland barley seeds sown by the People's Liberation Army in the newly cultivated farmland have sprouted tender green seedlings. The Chinese cabbage, scallions, and radishes in the vegetable garden are half a foot tall. In the distance, there are still a few patches of snow on the mountain peaks. It is just like early spring in the inland. Sturdy Tibetan women have already taken off their woolen gowns from their upper bodies, wrapped them around their waists, and exposed their bright red and green silk inner garments. They walk back and forth in the fields, carefully observing and learning the skills of watering, fertilizing, cultivating seedlings, and growing vegetables from the People's Liberation Army.
	The tune of "The East is Red" has spread throughout the valleys and plains. Groups of children see the People's Liberation Army passing by, and they happily raise their right hands and shout in newly learned Mandarin, "Long live Chairman Mao!" In the evening, when the People's Liberation Army returns from work, the children earnestly hold the comrades' hands, asking the PLA uncles to teach them a song.
	Since the signing of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet last year, the face of Lhasa has completely changed in less than a year since the People's Liberation Army entered Lhasa. This consumer city, the center of foreign goods dumping, is now gradually embarking on the path of production and construction. In early May this year, the People's Bank of China provided industrial and agricultural loans, which strongly stimulated the development of urban handicrafts and rural agriculture. The Tibetan people say: "Wherever the People's Liberation Army goes, there is happiness!"
	"Transform the wasteland of the Tibetan Plateau into fertile land!" This is the guarantee that the troops entering Tibet have made to the people of all ethnic groups in the country, especially the Tibetan people. And they have indeed done so. Taking the four suburbs of Lhasa as an example, what used to be piles of rubble and weeds have now become plots of highland barley fields and vegetable gardens. Newly opened canals are densely distributed on these lands like spider webs. Throughout the winter, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa used their hands to pick out piles of rubble from the ground, and used hoes and shovels to turn over the frozen soil. They transported manure and dirt cleared from the urban area to the fields as fertilizer. In this way, wasteland was transformed into fertile land. They were not afraid of the cold weather and hard ground, nor were they afraid of the strong winds and cold water. They stubbornly completed the planned work of diverting water and digging canals. This not only benefited the farmland in the four suburbs of Lhasa with irrigation, but also prevented or reduced the annual flooding of the Lhasa River.
	The heroic and tenacious actions of the People's Liberation Army in production and land reclamation, diverting water and digging canals, and overcoming the natural environment of the plateau, have excited the entire population of Lhasa! They know that the productive labor of the People's Liberation Army is for the construction of a new Tibet, for the Tibetan people. In the past, agents and lackeys of British and American imperialism spread rumors, saying that the People's Liberation Army would "eat up the food of the Tibetan people" when they came to Tibet. Now, the Tibetan people have personally seen the People's Liberation Army growing their own food to support themselves. The rumors of British and American imperialism have gone bankrupt! The concerns of the Tibetan people have disappeared! A Tibetan man in his sixties said: "Throughout history, no army has not relied on the people to grow food. Now the People's Liberation Army is growing its own food to support itself. This has never happened before."
	Farmers from the surrounding villages ride horses and travel for several days to visit and observe the farming methods of the People's Liberation Army. They tell the People's Liberation Army about their experience in growing crops on the plateau. They say: "We will tell you our experience in growing crops, and you will teach us the good methods you brought from the mainland. With the army and the people united as one, plus the close unity of the Dalai and Panchen under the leadership of Chairman Mao, Tibet will definitely increase production and have a bumper harvest this year."
	Beside the Cunpeng Gong River
	The Ga River and the Secha River meet at Cunpeng Gong and flow downstream into the Nujiang River. The muddy yellow water surges all year round. This is the only way to go on the transport route from Dingqing to Lhasa. In the past, countless livestock drowned here, and many transport caravans were washed away.
	After liberation, Jia Riben, the headman of the area in charge of more than 100 households, took the initiative to discuss matters with the People's Liberation Army. He said, "Supporting transportation is our glorious task. We cannot allow the grain transported from the rear to be washed away or soaked when crossing the river at Cunpeng Gong. We cannot let our People's Liberation Army eat moldy grain soaked in water on the front lines. We plan to build a bridge there."
	To build a bridge, wood is needed. It is difficult to find a single sapling on the grassland at an altitude of more than 4,000 meters. The Tibetan people said, "There is a primeval forest in the valley 30 to 40 miles away. Pine and cypress trees that three or four people cannot wrap their arms around are everywhere." However, cutting down trees is easy, but transporting them is difficult. It is really a problem to transport tall tree trunks from the mountains to here.
	The People's Liberation Army stationed in this area took the lead in creating experience. They built footrests on the cliffs, and forty or fifty people stood firmly, tying the tree trunks with the thickest yak hair ropes. At the command, everyone worked together. The tree trunk rolled! They steadily transported the first large tree trunk from the mountain to the riverbank, then lowered it into the water, where several ropes pulled in the Cunpeng Gong River blocked it. In this way, the first tree trunk, more than ten feet high and more than one foot thick, arrived safely at its destination.
	The Tibetan people were delighted when they saw this. Jia Riben gave the order: "Learn from the People's Liberation Army and compete with the People's Liberation Army!" That day, he specially slaughtered several cattle and made several jars of wine to encourage the Tibetan people who voluntarily and bravely participated in the competition. They held a meeting for half a day and invited comrades from the People's Liberation Army to study the secrets of carrying trees together.
	Early the next morning, the Tibetan people set out. They learned the method of carrying trees from the People's Liberation Army. Forty or so people carried a very large tree and walked even faster than the People's Liberation Army. The Tibetan people went ahead. The People's Liberation Army cheered enthusiastically:
	"Glory belongs to the Tibetan people!" Jia Riben, who was at the front, personally directing the tree carrying, was so excited that tears flowed down his face. He also led the Tibetan people to shout: "Glory belongs to Chairman Mao! Glory belongs to the Tibetan people's own army, the Chinese People's Liberation Army!"
	The task of transporting the tree trunks lying in the river to the shore was undertaken by the women. These sturdy women with slightly dark faces and round arms are the labor experts on the Tibetan Plateau and the first-class contributors to the bridge construction. In their hands, there has never been a task that could not be completed.
	The news of the joint military-civilian construction of the bridge quickly spread throughout the entire region. Tibetan people from afar brought tents and set them up by the river, enthusiastically participating in the major event that they had been looking forward to for many years and could only realize today.
	The tents woven from yellow-black yak hair, set up squarely like rooms, interspersed with the ridge tents set up by the People's Liberation Army with grass-green raincloth, like flowers of various colors densely distributed on the riverbank. Here, the joyful songs of labor in Tibetan and Chinese languages fill the air during the day; at night, the lights twinkle like millions of stars, illuminating this Tibetan Plateau.
	On May 26 this year, the commander of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army personally brought a cultural troupe to preside over the completion ceremony of the bridge. How high the people's emotions were! The roaring river could not suppress the song of national unity, and the violent wind and rain could not disperse the military-civilian celebration party. The giant thunder in the sky was sounding, and the heavy rain was pouring down. The dance costumes of the female comrades in the cultural troupe were soaked through, but the audience still applauded and cheered with all their might: "Sing another 'The East is Red'! Another 'Unity is Strength'!"
	The suffering of the Tibetan people who used to wade through the water for transportation will never return with the rolling water! Today, on this bridge built jointly by the army and the people, pedestrians, mules, horses, and yaks walk back and forth safely.
	National Defense Outpost
	The snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas overlook Phari.
	The small city has more than 400 households. The grassland at an altitude of about 5,400 meters is a good pasture. It takes eight days to walk north to Gyantse. It takes no more than two or three days to walk south, west, and east to the national defense border of the motherland. This is a gateway for internal and external transportation and trade, and even more so a frontier of national defense.
	On March 12 this year, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army entered Phari.
	The Tibetan people had long been eagerly waiting for their own army and looking forward to the arrival of their own army. They had already prepared firewood and houses.
	A welcome meeting of more than 1,000 people was held here. The entire residents of Phari City turned out. The narrow streets were crowded with people. The enthusiastic cheers and heroic songs echoed in the valleys of the distant Himalayas with a chorus of "Long Live Chairman Mao!"
	The heroic People's Liberation Army is stationed in Phari. The people of Phari say:
	"The people of all ethnic groups in the motherland love peace. We will not invade others. But if any imperialist dares to try to invade Tibet again, the Tibetan people will surely beat them until their heads are broken and bleeding!"

    西藏高原上的人民和解放军                                
    曹树经
    拉萨的春天
    五月的拉萨，天总是晴朗的。十三层的布达拉宫的金顶，映着太阳闪闪发光。人民解放军在新开垦出的耕地里撒下的青稞麦种，已长出嫩绿的幼苗。菜地里的小白菜、大葱、萝卜，长得半尺来高。远远的山头，还有几点积雪。这正是内地的初春时光。健壮的藏族妇女们，却早已把羊毛布长衫褪下上身，缠在腰里，露出大红大绿的纺绸内褂，在地里来回走着，用心观摩和学习人民解放军浇水施肥育苗种菜的本事。
    “东方红”的曲子唱遍了山谷原野。成群的孩子看见解放军走过，都高兴地举起右手，用才学会的汉话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”傍晚，解放军收工回来的时候，孩子们恳切地拉住同志们的手，要求解放军叔叔教个歌子。
    自从去年关于和平解放西藏办法的协议签订以后，人民解放军进驻拉萨不到一年的时间，拉萨的面貌完全改变了。这个消费的城市，外货倾销的中心，现在逐渐走上生产建设的途径。今年五月初，人民银行举办了手工业贷款和农业贷款，有力地刺激了城市手工业和乡村农业的发展。藏族人民说：“解放军到那里，那里就是幸福！”
    “把西藏高原的荒地变成良田！”这是进藏部队向全国各族人民特别是西藏人民提出的保证。他们也的确这样做了。拿拉萨四郊来说，过去多少碎石成堆、野草横生的荒地，现在都变成一块块的青稞地和菜园了。新开的水渠像蛛网似地密布在这些土地上。一冬天，驻拉萨的人民解放军用双手把一堆堆的碎石从地里捡出来，用锄头、铁锹把一块块冻硬了的土地翻起来，把从市区清除出来的粪便秽土，运到地里当肥料，这样，荒地变成了肥田。他们不怕天冷地硬，不怕风大水寒，顽强地完成了预定的引水开渠工作。这不仅使拉萨四郊的农田得到了灌溉之利，一年一度的拉萨河的泛滥也会因此被防止或减轻。
    解放军生产开荒，引水开渠，战胜高原自然环境的英勇顽强的行动，使整个拉萨的市民都欢动了！他们知道了解放军的生产劳动是为了建设新西藏，是为了西藏人民。过去英美帝国主义的特务和走狗曾制造谣言，说解放军到西藏会“吃光藏民的粮食”。现在藏族人民亲眼看见解放军自己种地养活自己。英美帝国主义的谣言破产了！藏民的顾虑消失了！一位六十多岁的藏民说；“有史以来，没有一个军队不是靠人民种地养活的。现在解放军自己种地养活自己，这是从来没有的事。”
    四乡的农民，都骑着马，走几天的路程来参观解放军的耕作方法。他们告诉解放军在高原种植农作物的经验。他们说：“我们把自己种庄稼的经验告诉你们，你们把从内地带来的好办法也教给我们。军民一条心，再加上达赖和班禅在毛主席领导下的亲密团结，西藏今年一定增产丰收。”
    寸朋公河边
    噶河和色擦河在寸朋公地方汇合，下游注入怒江。泥黄色的水，终年澎湃汹涌。这是从丁青到拉萨的运输大道所必经之处。往年这里不知淹死过多少牲畜，冲走了多少运输驮子。
    解放以后，这个地区管理百户以上的大头人呷日本主动找解放军商谈。他说：“支援运输是我们的光荣任务。我们不能让从后方运来的粮食在寸朋公过河的时候被冲走或淹湿。我们更不能让我们的解放军在前方吃水泡过的霉烂的粮食。我们打算在那里修座桥。”
    要修桥，就要用木料。在拔海四千多公尺的草原上，找根树苗都很困难。藏民说：“距这里三、四十里远的河谷，有一片原始森林。三、四个人搂不住的松柏，到处都是。”可是，砍树容易运树难。要把几丈高的大树干，从山上运到这里，真是个难题。
    驻在这个地区的人民解放军带头创造经验。他们在悬崖上架住脚蹬，四、五十个人都站稳了脚步，用顶粗的牛毛绳子拴住了树干。口令一喊，大家一齐用力。树干滚动了！他们稳重地把第一根大树干从山上运到河边，再顺水放下，由在寸朋公河里扯的几根绳子挡住。就是这样，第一根十丈来高、一丈多粗的大树干，顺利地到了目的地。
    藏民一看，可乐了。呷日本发命令：“向解放军学习，和解放军竞赛！”那天他特别杀了几条牛，打了几坛酒，鼓励那些自动奋勇参加竞赛的藏民。他们足足开了半天会，请解放军同志一道来研究抬树的秘诀。
    第二天一早，藏民出动了。他们学习解放军抬树的方法。四十来个人抬起一棵顶大的树，比解放军走得还快。藏民赶到前头去了。解放军热烈欢呼：
    “光荣属于西藏人民！”走在头里、亲自指挥抬树的呷日本激动得流出泪来，也领着藏民高呼：“光荣属于毛主席！光荣属于西藏人民自己的军队中国人民解放军！”
    把躺在河里的树干运到岸上来的任务，由妇女们担承下来。这些面孔微黑的，胳膊圆圆的健壮结实的妇女，是西藏高原上的劳动能手，是修桥的一等功臣。在她们手里从来没有不能完成的任务。
    军民合力修建大桥的消息，迅速传遍了整个地区。远处的藏民都带来帐篷，搭在河边，踊跃地参加了他们多少年来所盼望的而今天才能实现的大事。
    黄黑色的牛毛线织成的帐篷，搭得方方的像间房子，间杂着人民解放军用草绿色雨布搭起来的脊领帐篷，像各色花朵密布在河边。在这里，白天到处充满了藏、汉语言的欢欣的劳动的歌声；夜晚，点点灯火像千万颗明星，照耀在这西藏高原上。
    今年五月二十六日，人民解放军某部司令员亲自带着文工队来主持大桥落成典礼。人们的情绪是多么高昂啊！怒吼的河水压不住民族团结的歌声，狂风暴雨吹不散军民庆功的晚会。天空的巨雷在响着，大雨在倾盆地下着，文工队女同志们的舞蹈服装都被淋透了，可是台下仍是一股劲地鼓掌和欢呼：“再唱一个‘东方红’！再来一个‘团结就是力量’！”
    过去藏民们涉水运输的苦难，随着滚滚流水一去不复返了！今天，在这军民合力修建的大桥上，行人、骡马、牦牛安全地走来走去。
    国防前哨
    喜马拉雅山的雪峰俯瞰着帕里。
    不大的城市，有四百多户人家。拔海约五千四百公尺的草原，是良好的牧场。向北走八天的路程，就到江孜。向南向西向东，都走不到两、三天的路程，就是祖国的国防边界。这是一个内外交通贸易的大门，更是国防的前哨。
    今年三月十二日，人民解放军某部进驻帕里。
    藏族人民早已热望着自己的军队，期待着自己军队的到来，他们早已准备好柴草和房子了。
    这里举行了一千多人的欢迎大会。帕里市的整个居民都出动了。不宽的街道，人挤得满满的。热烈的欢呼，雄迈的高歌，远远的喜马拉雅山的山谷里，响起了一片“毛主席万岁！”的回声。
    英勇的人民解放军进驻帕里，帕里的人民说：
    “祖国的各族人民都是爱好和平的。我们不会侵略别人。可是任何帝国主义要是胆敢再尝试侵略西藏，西藏人民一定会把它打得头破血流！”
