    Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Appeal to the People of the World

    We, the three hundred and sixty-seven representatives from thirty-seven countries, gathered at the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual trust; we belong to different nationalities and races, hold different religious beliefs and political views, but represent the strong will of sixteen hundred million people to strive for peace; we unanimously believe that striving for and defending peace is an urgent task that must and can be accomplished through common efforts.

    In Korea, a cruel war has been going on for more than two years. Bacteriological weapons, napalm bombs, indiscriminate bombing, and other methods of mass murder are being used unscrupulously. Peaceful cities and villages have been burned and destroyed; innocent men, women, and children have been subjected to terrible atrocities. This war has taken countless human lives and happiness. The United States government is hindering the realization of a ceasefire in Korea by refusing to repatriate prisoners of war in accordance with the principles of international law. The repeated sabotage of peace talks, the use of illegal warfare methods, and the violation of Chinese sovereignty by the U.S. military command are all provocative acts that endanger the expansion of the war.

    At the same time, in countries such as Vietnam and Malaya, armed intervention to suppress the people's desire for freedom continues.

    The United States government, in order to turn Japan into a war base for launching a new war against the Asian and Pacific regions, has violated solemn international agreements and is fostering the revival of Japanese militarism. For the entire region, this is reviving the demon of war. In many countries of this region, the struggle for national liberation and the maintenance of national independence is suffering from foreign interference. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of many countries have been violated due to the forced establishment of military bases and the forced signing of military alliances. The wealth of many countries is being plundered, and their economic resources are being exploited to serve foreign aggressive war plans. In countries forced to participate in large-scale arms expansion and war preparations, high prices and inflation are seriously affecting the people's living standards. Blockades and embargoes have caused more unnecessary hardship, disrupting economies that have not yet fully recovered from the effects of World War II. Cultural undertakings and social improvement plans in many countries have had to be halted. In many parts of this region, women's rights are violated, and children's welfare is neglected. In order to defend and promote war policies, some people are using deceptive propaganda to incite international suspicion, promote theories of racial discrimination, and use various methods to create divisions between nations.

    In sharp contrast to this headlong rush towards war is the sincere desire of people all over the world to end the current conflicts, to use the forces and resources used to destroy life to build and beautify life, and to guarantee humanity the lasting peace it deserves.

    The people of all countries still enslaved by foreign powers recognize that the struggle for national liberation and the struggle against war are closely linked and inseparable. War preparations are strengthening the chains that enslave them. In countries whose governments are leading the way in war preparations, people live in fear and insecurity; they are realizing that security and stability can only be achieved through peaceful development. Those countries with huge peaceful economic construction plans are eagerly hoping for peace so that they can continue their work of raising the living standards of their people.

    The people of the Asian and Pacific regions are united by a common goal: to oppose war and defend peace.

    We reaffirm our firm belief that countries with different social systems and ways of life can coexist peacefully and cooperate for mutual benefit.

    We fully understand that peace cannot wait; peace must be fought for. To win lasting peace, we must unite and wage an unremitting struggle.

    For the peace of this region and the world, it must be demanded that:

    An immediate ceasefire in Korea be achieved on a fair and reasonable basis; the wars in Vietnam, Malaya, and other regions be ended; and all foreign troops be withdrawn from these regions.

    The revival of Japanese militarism be stopped; a genuine peace treaty between the relevant countries and Japan be concluded; and a new Japan be established that is independent, democratic, free, and peaceful.

    One country must not interfere in the internal affairs of another; one country must not infringe upon the sovereignty of another; and national independence must be defended and realized.

    Blockades and embargoes must be opposed; economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between countries must be promoted on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

    The incitement of war must be prohibited; racial discrimination must be opposed; women's rights must be protected, and children's welfare must be promoted.

    A five-power peace pact must be concluded quickly. Disarmament must be implemented, and the use of atomic, bacteriological, and chemical weapons, as well as other weapons of mass destruction, must be prohibited.

    The American people have a particularly important responsibility in the struggle to defend peace in the Asian and Pacific regions and throughout the world.

    The actions of the United States government in waging war and preparing for war in this region and other parts of the world are a profound disaster for the people of the Asian and Pacific regions and for the people of the world. Although these actions are carried out in the name of the American people, they do not conform to the will or the interests of the American people.

    Therefore, the urgent need and solemn obligation of the American people is to take responsibility for stopping these actions of their government and leading their country onto the path of peace.

    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference expresses its respect to the American people who are struggling for peace amidst great difficulties. We hope that the American people will intensify their struggle, strengthen their unity, and defend peace. We wish them success in this noble cause and extend to them our hand of friendship.

    We understand that the Japanese people are suffering severe pain under the oppression of the American occupiers and their own militarist rulers. We believe that they will stand with the people of other countries in the Asian and Pacific regions to fight for national independence and to avoid becoming cannon fodder. The people of the Asian and Pacific regions will fully support the Japanese people's heroic struggle to defend peace and fight for independence. We wish them success and extend to them our hand of friendship.

    The monstrous atrocities that accompany the current war have aroused the conscience of every good man and woman. The mass slaughter of civilians, the insane destruction of peaceful cities and villages, and the unprecedented terror inflicted upon innocent women and children have made modern warfare an instrument of complete destruction. The crime of killing one's fellow human beings with the most vicious weapons invented by mankind threatens to spread to other places and peoples. If the cultural achievements of long ages are not to be completely destroyed, if life is not to become a bestial struggle for survival, if life is to retain some measure of humanity, then the bloody crimes in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and other countries must be stopped. The tragic prospect of another world war endangers the lives of every man, woman, and child. Therefore, the struggle to win peace and prevent the world from going to war is our common responsibility. The people of the Asian and Pacific regions are determined to wage a relentless struggle against the forces of war; and are firmly convinced that, in cooperation with all people of goodwill, they will be able to avert the catastrophe that threatens us, eliminate the clouds of war, and clear the way for the dawn of universal friendship and lasting peace.

                                Beijing, October 12, 1952

### 亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议  告世界人民书

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    告世界人民书
    我们来自三十七个国家的三百六十七位代表，在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上，在友好和互相信任的气氛中聚集一堂；我们属于不同的民族和种族，持有不同的宗教信仰和政治见解，但代表着十六亿人民争取和平的坚强意志；我们一致认为争取和保卫和平乃是一个必须而且能够以共同的努力来完成的迫切任务。
    在朝鲜，残酷的战争已经进行了两年多。细菌武器、凝固汽油弹、滥肆轰炸以及其他大规模屠杀方法，正被肆无忌惮地使用着。和平的城市和乡村被焚烧和毁灭了；无辜的男女和儿童遭到可怕的暴行。这一个战争已经夺去了无数人的生命和幸福。美国政府拒绝依照国际法原则遣返战俘，阻碍着朝鲜停战的实现。美国军事指挥部再三破坏和谈，使用非法的战争方法，以及侵犯中国主权，都是有扩大战争的危险的挑衅行为。
    同时，在越南和马来亚等国，企图镇压人民争取自由愿望的武装干涉在继续着。
    美国政府为了把日本变成一个战争基地，来发动对亚洲及太平洋区域的新战争，违反了庄严的国际协定，扶植日本军国主义复活。对于整个区域来说，这就是把战争的恶魔又复活起来。在本区域的许多国家里，争取民族解放与维护民族独立的斗争正遭受着外国的干涉。由于军事基地的强行建立和军事同盟的强迫签订，许多国家的主权和领土完整遭受了侵犯。许多国家的财富正受到掠夺，它们的经济资源正被掠夺来为外国的侵略战争计划服务。在被迫参加大规模扩军备战运动的国家里，物价高涨，通货膨胀，严重地影响了人民的生活水平。封锁和禁运造成了更多不必要的困苦，使得还没有完全从第二次世界大战的影响下恢复过来的经济，又陷于紊乱。许多国家的文化事业和社会改进计划不得不停顿。在本区域的很多地方，妇女的权利被侵犯，儿童的福利被忽视。为了辩护并促进战争政策，有人正在通过欺骗宣传，来煽动国际间的猜疑，宣扬种族歧视的理论，并用各种方法来制造各民族之间的分裂。
    和这种向战争狂奔成鲜明对比的是：全世界的人民都诚恳地渴望停止目前的各种冲突，把用来毁灭生命的力量和资源用来建设并美化生活，并保证人类应有持久和平。
    仍然为外国奴役着的各国人民认识到，争取民族解放的斗争与反对战争的斗争，是紧密结合，不能分开的。备战正在加强着奴役他们的锁链。在其政府正领导着备战的国家中，人民生活在恐惧与毫无保障之中；他们正在认识到，只有经过和平发展才能获得安全和稳定。那些有巨大的和平经济建设计划的国家，迫切地渴望和平，以便继续进行提高人民生活水平的工作。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民坚持共同的目标，就是反对战争，保卫和平。
    我们重申我们坚定的信心：具有不同社会制度和生活方式的国家是能够和平共处、互利合作的。
    我们充分了解：和平不能等待，和平必须争取。为了赢得持久和平，我们必须团结起来进行不懈的斗争。
    为了这个区域和世界的和平，必须要求：
    立即在公平合理的基础上，实现朝鲜停战；结束越南、马来亚及其他地区的战争；并从这些地区撤退一切外国军队。
    制止日本军国主义复活；缔结有关各国与日本之间的真正的和约；建立独立、民主、自由与和平的新日本。
    反对一个国家干涉另一国家的内政；反对一个国家侵犯另一国家的主权；保卫并实现民族独立。
    反对封锁和禁运；在平等互利基础上促进各国间的经济合作和文化交流。
    禁止煽动战争；反对种族歧视；保护妇女权利，增进儿童福利。
    迅速缔结五大国和平公约。实行裁减军备，禁止使用原子、细菌和化学武器及其他大规模屠杀的武器。
    美国人民在保卫亚洲及太平洋区域与全世界和平的斗争中，负有特别重大的责任。
    美国政府在本区域和世界其他地区进行战争与准备战争的行为，对于亚洲及太平洋区域人民以及全世界的人民都是深重的祸害。这些行为虽然是假借美国人民的名义进行的，但是既不符合美国人民的意志，也不符合他们的利益。
    因此，美国人民的迫切需要和庄严的义务就是，担当起责任来制止他们政府的这些行为，并把他们的国家引到和平的道路。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议向正在巨大困难中为和平而斗争的美国人民表示敬意。我们希望美国人民加紧斗争，加强团结，来保卫和平。我们祝他们在这个崇高的事业中获得成功并向他们伸出我们的友谊的手。
    我们了解：日本人民在美国占领者和本国军国主义统治者的压迫下，遭受着严重的痛苦。我们相信，他们一定会和亚洲及太平洋区域其他各国人民站在一起，为民族独立并为免作炮灰而斗争。亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民，将全力支持日本人民保卫和平、争取独立的英勇斗争。我们祝他们成功并向他们伸出我们的友谊的手。
    目前战争所伴随的滔天暴行已经激起每一个善良男女的良心。对平民的大规模屠杀，对和平城市和乡村的疯狂破坏，以及加诸于无辜妇女儿童身上的空前的恐怖，都使近代战争成为一个毁灭一切的工具。用人类发明的最恶毒的武器来屠杀同类的罪行，势将波及其它地方和人民。如果不让悠久年代的文化成就毁灭无余，如果不让生命变成禽兽的生存竞争，如果还要生命保留几分人道，那么，在朝鲜、越南和马来亚及其他国家的血腥罪行便必须加以制止。另一次世界大战的凄惨远景，使每一男女和儿童的生命都受到危险。所以，为争取和平并制止世界走向战争的斗争是我们的共同职责。亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民抱定决心，要向战争势力进行无情的斗争；并且坚信：他们在与一切善意的人们合作之下，一定能够避免威胁着我们的浩劫，消除战争的阴云，并廓清人们的眼界，来迎接普遍友好与持久和平的曙光。
                                一九五二年十月十二日于北京
