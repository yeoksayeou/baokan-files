The Current Situation of the United States Supporting Japan's Remilitarization

Since occupying Japan, the United States has violated the resolutions of various international conferences on the Japanese issue, deliberately utilizing Japan's war potential and reviving Japanese militarism as an important tool for the United States to launch a new world war. The United States has turned Japan into its colony and military base, and made Japan's reactionary ruling clique its docile pawns. The United States is becoming increasingly fanatical about restoring Japan's aggressive forces. The United States' aggression against Japan is developing simultaneously with Japan's remilitarization. Japan's aggressive forces are actively restoring their strength while selling themselves out.

In addition to shattering Japan's rivers and mountains and establishing hundreds of military bases and facilities on Japanese territory, the United States also endangers the lives of millions of Japanese people by demanding that Japan provide a large number of cannon fodder for aggression. As early as February 1949, Major General Eichelberger, former commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Japan and advisor to the U.S. Department of Defense on Japanese affairs, said that the Japanese were "the cheapest army in the world. They have combat experience, their food is simple, and their equipment can be manufactured in Japan with very simple raw materials." Under these circumstances, Japan's army, navy, and air force are being restored.

After the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, MacArthur ordered the Yoshida government on July 8, 1950, to establish a "Police Reserve" of 75,000 men and expand the "Maritime Safety Agency" to 18,000 men, as the basis for rebuilding the Japanese army and navy. Before and after the United States signed the separate peace treaty with Japan in 1951, Dulles visited Japan three times to discuss with Yoshida the issue of accelerating the reorganization of Japanese armaments. Dulles demanded that Yoshida establish a force of 300,000 men by the end of 1953. At the same time, the Yoshida government submitted a plan to the United States to build an air force of 1,789 aircraft and a navy of 308,300 tons of warships within eight years. After the signing of the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement" on February 28 this year, the United States' drive for Japan to reorganize its military became even more urgent. On the same day that the U.S. separate peace treaty with Japan "took effect" on April 28, the Yoshida government formally established the "Maritime Security Force." In July, the Yoshida government expanded the "Police Reserve" to 110,000 men. On August 1, the Japanese government established the "Security Agency" – a disguised new military department – to oversee the "Police Reserve" and the "Maritime Security Force." On September 13, when the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Murphy, met with Yoshida, he demanded that Japan immediately begin to expand its "defense" forces and increase this army to 320,000 men within two years. This number is equivalent to the strength of the Japanese imperialists when they provoked the Second World War in Asia in 1931. Therefore, this is no longer a "defense" force, but a basic force for aggression.

Most of the weapons used by the "Police Reserve" are supplied by the United States. On June 26 this year, Japanese State Minister Takeo Ohashi stated that the United States would soon supply the Japanese government with 100 light aircraft. After October, the "Police Reserve" plans to increase its equipment, including tanks, artillery, and radar. On July 5, the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun" stated: "This autumn, after the United States lends artillery to Japan, the heavy-equipped divisions in each district will far exceed the pre-war Japanese armored divisions." In fact, according to the head of the force, Keikichi Masuhara, the "Police Reserve" has already used heavy artillery and tanks in training. The "Police Reserve" currently has 3,527 vehicles of various types and has ordered 11,253 more, planning to have one car for every ten members. This June, the team ordered 75,000 steel helmets and prepared to order another 300,000. In addition, it also plans to order 600,000 yards of tents, of which the tents ordered from the Japan Imperial Hemp Manufacturing Company and the Japan Fiber Industry Company are specially designed for use in the South, which is clearly not for "defense" purposes.

Recently, on October 15, the Yoshida government formally reorganized the "Police Reserve" into the "Security Force" and held a parade in Tokyo. This is the prelude to Japan's open and large-scale reconstruction of its aggressive army.

The Japanese navy, disguised as the "Maritime Security Force," is also rapidly recovering under the support of the United States. The first batch of 3,000 personnel of the "Maritime Security Force" joined the Yokosuka Regional Headquarters on June 18 this year. The second and third batches of members will continue to be recruited in September and November this year, with a plan to recruit a total of 7,590 members by the end of this year. After completing their land training, many officers and non-commissioned officers have now boarded ships and are undergoing "enemy landing" training.

When the "Maritime Safety Agency" was established in 1948, Japan's "patrol" fleet had 30 ships from the former Japanese Navy. By last October, the "Maritime Safety Agency" had 79 various ships. This year, its ships will reach more than 90. At the end of last year, the director of the "Maritime Safety Agency," Yuzawa Yonekichi, also boasted that according to Japan's three-year "strengthening maritime defense" plan, another 100 ships will be launched. On June 30 this year, the "Asahi Shimbun" stated that after the U.S. government approved the bill to lend 68 ships, the Yoshida government also planned to borrow 10 new-style destroyers of the 4,000-ton class from the United States again in 1953, and build at least 20 fast patrol boats of the 1,000-ton to 1,500-ton class in Japan.

In August this year, the Japanese Ministry of Transport and the "Security Agency" requested an appropriation of 7 billion yen to build new ships, rebuild the naval military bases in Kure, Sasebo, and Ominato, and install cannons on patrol ships.

The Japanese Navy was an indispensable tool for Japanese imperialism's foreign aggression. From the above facts, it can be seen that the prototype of the Japanese regular navy is growing under the incubation of the United States.

The Japanese government is also preparing to rebuild the air force. At the end of 1951, the Yoshida government submitted an eight-year plan to the United States to rebuild the air force. Due to the requirements of the United States, this plan has now been shortened to four years. On March 8 this year, the U.S. military headquarters in Japan even notified the Yoshida government that Japan could manufacture various weapons, including aircraft, in the future. As a result, the Yoshida government immediately prepared to publicly resume aircraft production, planning to establish an air force of 2,000 aircraft by 1955, including Japanese-made jet fighters.

In order to adapt to the needs of rebuilding the army, navy, and air force, the Japanese government recently decided to publicly restore military academies and establish the so-called "Security University," specializing in training new military cadres. This "Security University" is actually a merger of the former Japanese military's military academies such as the Military Academy and the Naval Academy. According to Japan's Kyodo News Agency, the "Security Agency" is also preparing to establish higher-level military schools than the "Security University," equivalent to the former Japanese military's Army University and Naval University.

At the same time, the United States is stepping up its efforts to cultivate Japan into a Far East arsenal for the United States. Japan's arms industry and heavy industry, which is closely related to the arms industry, are being restored and expanded.

Under the direction of the United States, as early as the end of 1949, 645 Japanese military enterprises that had originally been designated as reparations had resumed production. After the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, it more actively promoted the development of Japan's arms industry to serve its war of aggression. The United States signed huge contracts with Japanese arms companies under the guise of "special procurements." As of August 31 this year, the total value of such "special procurement" contracts has reached more than US$763 million. After the U.S. occupation authorities unilaterally revoked the ban on Japan producing weapons, they returned nearly 850 of the 878 factories previously designated as reparations to Japan on April 26 this year. These factories are all war enterprises, the main ones being: 314 aircraft factories, 131 armories, 25 laboratories used for testing aircraft and ammunition, as well as many steel plants, machine tool plants, shipyards, and synthetic rubber plants. In the past, many Japanese aircraft companies such as "Kawasaki" and "Fuji" are preparing to resume operations, and the Tokyo Aircraft Company has been newly established. According to the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, future "special procurements" will be "concentrated on weapons and ammunition." In order to adapt to this need, 90 large Japanese arms manufacturers formed the "Japan Arms Production Cooperation Committee" in August this year. All of this has greatly improved Japan's arms production capacity, giving its aggressive forces a greater material basis. Now the production of Japan's heavy industry has reached the level of 1937.

The United States not only uses Japan's arms industry to carry out its war of aggression against Korea, but also uses weapons manufactured in Japan to massacre the people of other Asian countries. The U.S. military in Japan ordered weapons worth US$100 million from Japanese companies before July this year. According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," these orders "are related to the U.S. plan for other Asian countries."

The rearmament policy has brought huge profits to Japanese monopoly capitalists and arms manufacturers. The vast Japanese people have to bear heavy taxes. In order to rearm, the Japanese government desperately squeezes the blood and sweat of the Japanese people. Under these circumstances, the Japanese government's military budget has increased year by year and has reached an alarming number.

The budget for the "Police Reserve" was 20 billion yen in fiscal year 1950, increased to 31 billion yen in fiscal year 1951, and further increased to 62.3 billion yen in fiscal year 1952. The budget for the "Maritime Safety Agency" is also increasing, reaching 18.8 billion yen in fiscal year 1952.

The Japanese government's total budget for fiscal year 1952 is as high as 850 billion yen, an increase of 30 percent over last year. Direct and indirect military expenditures account for 70 percent of this total budget. The public and formal military appropriations account for 220 billion yen; before the Yoshida government dissolved the Diet, it also prepared to add more than 100 billion yen to this amount.

According to the London "Financial Times," in order to accelerate the rearmament of Japan, the United States will allocate US$750 million to the Japanese government in this fiscal year, which is an increase of US$130 million over the U.S. allocation to Japan in 1951.

The huge budget and military expenditure are making the lives of the Japanese people increasingly impoverished. The war policy has severely devastated peaceful industries, and more than 6,700 small and medium-sized enterprises have now declared bankruptcy. The lives of workers and peasants are even more impoverished. The U.S. occupiers and the Japanese reactionary government are trying to turn the countryside from the former source of soldiers for the "Imperial Army" into a source of soldiers for the U.S. mercenary army.

The Japanese people, who are in deep distress, have launched a heroic struggle for liberation. The U.S. occupiers and the Japanese reactionary government are actively plotting to suppress the peaceful and democratic movement of the Japanese people in order to remove obstacles to rearmament. Fascism is being revived in Japan.

The notorious "Public Security Preservation Law" of pre-war militarist Japan has been reissued. On July 21 this year, the so-called "Law for the Prevention of Destructive Activities" was declared "effective." In addition, the Yoshida government has formulated a series of fascist bills. At the beginning of July, the Yoshida government also implemented "resident registration" nationwide, the purpose of which is to strengthen fascist rule and prepare to restore conscription.

In order to accelerate the fascistization and militarization of Japan, the United States has released most of the heinous Japanese war criminals and completely lifted the purge of more than 206,000 militarists. Most of these war criminals and militarists have been re-employed and have infiltrated the army, government agencies, and secret service agencies to re-assume important positions. Shi Shiro and other bacteriological warfare criminals have been actively active under the protection of the United States and have participated in the crime of the United States using bacteriological weapons in Korea. Fifty former Japanese military leaders have established the "Tokyo Veterans Association." This is the first step in the revival of the "Japan Veterans Association," the nationwide fascist military organization in Japan during the war. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department also admits that there are about 400 such militaristic and fascist groups and organizations throughout Japan.

The Japanese militarists, incubated under the United States, now feel that their feathers are full. Not long ago, Shigeru Yoshida dared to publicly clamor that Japan should "lead Asia." This shows that the Japanese reactionary group is reliving its old dream of conquering Asia and the Pacific region.

The vast people of Asia and the Pacific region have fresh memories of the profound disasters caused by Japanese militarism in the Second World War. The Japanese people are well aware of the painful disasters that Japanese militarism brought to the Japanese nation. The peace-loving people of Asia and the Pacific region, including the Japanese people, will surely unite more closely to oppose the remilitarization of Japan, to defeat the war plots of the United States, and to defend and strive for lasting peace in Asia and the world.

    美国扶植日本重新军国主义化的现状
    美国自占领日本以来，就违背有关日本问题的历次国际会议的决议，蓄意利用日本的战争潜力，复活日本军国主义，以作为美国发动新的世界战争的重要工具。美国已把日本变为自己的殖民地和军事基地，并使日本的反动统治集团变为自己的驯服走卒。美国对恢复日本侵略势力是越来越疯狂了。美国对日本的侵略与日本重新军国主义化是同时发展的。日本的侵略势力正在卖身投靠的情况下积极恢复自己的力量。
    美国除了把日本的河山弄得支离破碎，在日本领土上建立了数百个军事基地和军事设施外，还要危害千百万日本人民的生活和生命，要求日本提供大量的侵略炮灰。早在一九四九年二月，前驻日美军第八军军长、美国国防部日本问题顾问艾契柏格就说过：日本人是“世界上最廉价的军队。他们有战斗经验，他们的粮食简单，他们的装备能在日本用很简单的原料制造。”在这种情况下，日本的陆海空军正在恢复。
    美国发动侵朝战争后，麦克阿瑟即在一九五○年七月八日下令吉田政府建立七万五千人的“警察后备队”，并把“海上保安厅”的人员扩充为一万八千人，作为重建日本陆、海军的基础。一九五一年美国签订单独对日和约前后，杜勒斯曾三度到日本，与吉田会商加紧重整日本军备问题。杜勒斯要求吉田在一九五三年年底以前建立三十万人的部队。吉田政府并于同时向美国提出在八年内建立一支拥有一千七百八十九架飞机的空军和拥有三十万八千三百吨舰艇的海军计划。今年二月二十八日美日“行政协定”签订后，美国驱使日本重整军备更为紧迫。在四月二十八日美国对日单独和约“生效”的同一天，吉田政府正式设立了“海上警备队”。七月间吉田政府把“警察后备队”扩充为十一万人。八月一日日本政府设立了统辖“警察后备队”和“海上警备队”的“保安厅”——变相的新军部。九月十三日，美国驻日大使墨菲与吉田会谈时，更要求日本立即着手扩充“防御”军，在两年内要把这支军队增到三十二万人。这个数目相当于日本帝国主义一九三一年在亚洲挑动第二次世界大战时的兵力。因此这已不是什么“防御”兵力，而是进行侵略的基本兵力。
    “警察后备队”所使用的武器大部由美国供给，今年六月二十六日吉田政府国务相大桥武夫声称，美国不久将供给日本政府一百架轻型飞机。十月以后，“警察后备队”计划增加坦克、大炮、雷达等装备。七月五日日本“每日新闻”称：“今秋美国贷给日本大炮后，各管区的重装备师团，远非战前日本装甲师团所能及。”实际上，据该队本部长官增原惠吉透露，“警察后备队”在训练中早已使用重炮和坦克。“警察后备队”现有各式车辆三千五百二十七辆，并订购了一万一千二百五十三辆，计划每十个队员有一辆汽车。今年六月，该队订购了七万五千顶钢盔，并准备再订购三十万顶。此外还要订购帐幕六十万码，其中已向日本帝国制麻公司及日本纤维工业公司订购的帐幕，是专门设计为在南方使用的，这显然不是为了“防御”目的的。
    最近，十月十五日，吉田政府更把“警察后备队”正式改编为“保安队”，并在东京举行了检阅式。这是日本公开大规模重建侵略军的先声。
    在“海上警备队”伪装下的日本海军，也在美国扶植下迅速恢复中。“海上警备队”第一批人员三千人，今年六月十八日在横须贺地方总监部入队。今年九月及十一月还要继续招募第二、三批队员，计划到今年年底共招队员七千五百九十名。许多军官级和士级队员的陆上训练完毕后，现在大部分已登上舰艇，并在进行“敌前登陆”的训练。
    一九四八年“海上保安厅”成立时，日本的“巡逻”舰队拥有前日本海军的三十艘舰只。到去年十月时，“海上保安厅”已有七十九艘各种舰只。今年它的舰只将达九十艘以上。去年年底，“海上保安厅”长官柳泽米吉还夸口说：按照日本的三年“加强海防”计划，将另有一百艘舰只下水。今年六月三十日“朝日新闻”称，吉田政府在美国政府批准上项贷给六十八艘舰艇的法案后，又拟于一九五三年再度向美国租借包括四千吨级的新式驱逐舰十艘，并至少在日本建造一千吨至一千五百吨级的快速巡逻艇二十艘。
    今年八月日本运输省和“保安厅”要求拨款七十亿日元，来建造新舰只，重建吴港、佐世保和大凑的海军军事基地，以及在巡逻舰上装置大炮。
    日本海军曾是日本帝国主义对外侵略的不可缺少的工具。从以上事实可以看到日本正规海军的雏形正在美国的孵育下成长着。
    日本政府也在准备重建空军。一九五一年底吉田政府向美国提出重建空军的八年计划。由于美国的要求，这项计划现在已缩短为四年。今年三月八日，驻日美军总部竟通知吉田政府日本今后可以制造包括飞机在内的各种武器。于是吉田政府立即准备公开恢复飞机生产，计划到一九五五年建立两千架飞机的空军，其中并有日本造的喷气战斗机。
    日本政府为了适应重建陆海空军的需要，最近决定公开恢复军官学校，设立所谓“保安大学”，专门训练新的军事干部。这个“保安大学”实际上是合并前日本军部的士官学校、海军学校等军事学校而成的。据日本的共同社透露，“保安厅”还准备设立比“保安大学”更高一级的，相当于前日本军部的陆军大学和海军大学的高等军事学校。
    美国同时也加紧把日本培植成为美国的远东兵工厂。日本的军火工业以及与军火工业有密切关系的重工业正在恢复和扩大。
    在美国指使下，早在一九四九年底，在原已被指定充当赔偿的日本军事企业中，已有六百四十五家恢复了生产。美国发动侵朝战争后，更加积极促进日本军火工业的发展，以为它的侵略战争服务。美国以“特需”为名，与日本军火企业订了巨额的合同。截至今年八月三十一日止，这种“特需”合同总额已达七亿六千三百多万美元。美国占领当局擅自撤销禁止日本生产武器的禁令后，在今年四月二十六日并将以前被指定为赔偿的八百七十八所工厂中的将近八百五十所交还日本。这些工厂都是战争企业，其中主要的有：三百一十四个飞机工厂，一百三十一个兵工厂，二十五个用作试验飞机和弹药的实验室以及许多钢铁厂，工作母机厂，造船厂和人造橡胶厂。过去日本的“川崎”、“富士”等许多飞机公司正在筹备重新开工，并新设立了东京飞机公司。据日本通商产业省称，以后的“特需”将“集中于武器和弹药”。九十家日本大军火制造商为了适应这个需要，于今年八月组成了“日本军火生产合作委员会”。所有这些都使日本的军火生产能力大为提高，使其侵略势力有了更大的物质基础。现在日本重工业的生产业已达到一九三七年的水平。
    美国不仅利用日本的军火工业进行侵朝战争，并且也用日本制造的武器来屠杀亚洲其他国家的人民。驻日美军在今年七月前向日本公司订购了价值一亿美元的武器，据“读卖新闻”称，这些订货“和美国对其他亚洲国家的计划有关”。
    重整军备政策使日本的垄断资本家和军火制造商获得巨大利润。广大的日本人民却要负担沉重的捐税。日本政府为了重整军备，拚命榨取日本人民的血汗。在这种情况下，日本政府的军事预算逐年增加，并已达到惊人的数目。
    “警察后备队”的预算在一九五○年度为二百亿日元，一九五一年度增为三百一十亿日元，一九五二年度更增为六百二十三亿日元。“海上保安厅”的预算也在增加，一九五二年度为一百八十八亿日元。
    一九五二年度日本政府的总预算高达八千五百亿日元，比去年增加了百分之三十。直接和间接军费占这个总预算的百分之七十。其中公开的正式的军事拨款就占二千二百亿日元；在吉田政府解散国会以前，还准备把这个数目再追加一千亿日元以上。
    据伦敦“金融时报”报道，美国为了加速重新武装日本，将于本财政年度拨款七亿五千万美元给日本政府，这比一九五一年美国给日本的拨款增加了一亿三千万美元。
    庞大的预算和军费，使日本人民的生活越来越贫困。战争政策使和平工业遭到极大摧残，现已有六千七百多家中小企业宣告破产了。工人和农民的生活更加贫困。美国占领者和日本反动政府，企图把农村由往昔“皇军”的兵源地，变为美国雇佣军的兵源地。
    处于水深火热中的日本人民，展开了争取解放的英勇斗争。美国占领者和日本反动政府积极图谋镇压日本人民的和平民主运动，以便扫除重整军备的障碍。法西斯主义正在日本复活。
    战前军国主义日本的恶名昭彰的“治安维持法”已被再版。今年七月二十一日，所谓“防止破坏活动法”宣布“生效”。除此之外，吉田政府还制订了一系列的法西斯法案。七月初，吉田政府并在全国实施了“居民登记”，其目的是为了加强法西斯统治，并准备恢复征兵制。
    美国为了使日本加速法西斯化和军国主义化，已把罪恶滔天的日本战犯大部释放，并把数达二十万零六千余名被整肃的军国主义分子全部解除整肃。这些战犯和军国主义分子多已被起用，而潜入军队、政府机关和特务机关中重新充任要职。石井四郎等细菌战犯一直在美国的庇护下积极活动，并参与了美国在朝鲜使用细菌武器的罪行。前日本军事领袖五十人已经成立了“东京在乡军人会”。这是日本战时全国性的法西斯军人组织“日本在乡军人会”复活的第一步。东京警视厅也承认，这种军国主义法西斯团体和组织在日本全国约有四百个。
    在美国孵育下的日本军国主义分子，现在感到自己羽毛已丰。不久以前吉田茂竟敢于公开叫嚣日本要“领导亚洲”。由此可见，日本反动集团正在重温其征服亚洲及太平洋区域的旧梦。
    亚洲及太平洋区域的广大人民，对日本军国主义在第二次世界大战中所造成的深重灾难，记忆犹新。日本军国主义给日本民族带来的惨痛祸害，更是日本人民所深知的。包括日本人民在内的亚洲及太平洋区域爱好和平的人民，必将更加紧密地团结起来，为反对日本的重新军国主义化，为击败美国的战争阴谋，为保卫和争取亚洲及全世界的持久和平而斗争。
