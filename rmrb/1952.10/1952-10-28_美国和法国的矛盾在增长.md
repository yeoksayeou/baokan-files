    The Growing Contradictions Between the United States and France

    Recently, two events occurred in Paris that caused great anxiety in the United States. One was French Prime Minister Pinay's rejection of the American memorandum rebuking France for misusing American "aid." The other was the opposition of veterans of the Radical Socialist Party, one of France's main government parties, such as Herriot and Daladier, to the ratification of the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty in its current form. These facts show that the American plan to prepare for war in Western Europe, which seriously damages the sovereignty of its satellite states, has led to increasing contradictions within the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, which can no longer be concealed.

    It is known that the United States, under the guise of "economic assistance," dragged France into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and forced it to engage in frantic military expansion and preparation for war, in order to serve American war policies. The French ruling clique's pursuit of American war policies has plunged France into a serious economic crisis, while hoping to rely on American "aid" to alleviate their difficulties. However, the United States refused to fulfill its promise at the Lisbon conference to give France huge military orders, in order to pressure the French ruling clique to obey American orders more obediently. Due to the bitter pleas and complaints of the Pinay government, the United States agreed to allocate 550 million US dollars in "aid," but wanted to directly interfere in the use of this fund, in order to intensify its control over the French economy. This overbearing practice of the United States is in conflict with the interests of the French big bourgeoisie, and therefore cannot but arouse the dissatisfaction of the French ruling clique.

    France's experience fully exposes the sinister face of the United States using "economic assistance" to enslave and plunder its satellite states. The United States not only "wants the horse to run fast, but also wants the horse not to eat grass" for its satellite countries, but also does not hesitate to use their difficulties to increase pressure, making these countries further become military and economic appendages of the United States. The United States' infringement on French sovereignty has become increasingly serious, and its aggressive and arrogant attitude has reached a point that even the sycophantic Pinay government can hardly tolerate.

    On the other hand, the Pinay government's policy of selling national sovereignty and national independence in exchange for US dollars has put it in a serious political crisis. In particular, under the drive of the United States, it signed the Bonn separate treaty and the "European Defense Community" treaty, which revived German militarism, which aroused strong opposition from the French people. However, the United States continued to intensify its pressure, urging the French ruling clique to ratify these two sinful treasonous treaties. This made the French ruling clique caught in a dilemma, causing disputes within the French bourgeoisie.

    However, Pinay's open "disobedience," or the "annoyed complaints" of Herriot, Daladier, and others, are not expressions of independence. Pinay has expressed the hope that the United States will change its concept of assisting France; the resolution passed by the Radical Socialist Party also declared its support for the principle of the "European Defense Community." It can be seen that the French ruling clique still intends to pursue American war policies and continue to sell out French national interests, but they are trying to demand a higher price, while trying to make the French people believe that they are not completely American lackeys.

    Despite the fact that Pinay's resistance is only "kneeling resistance," and despite the fact that Herriot and Daladier's complaints are only a kind of "slight dissatisfaction," these two storms in Paris prove that the friction between the United States and its French servants is becoming increasingly acute. This is an insurmountable contradiction in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, and the wishful thinking that the United States had in Lisbon eight months ago is heading for bankruptcy.

### 美国和法国的矛盾在增长

    美国和法国的矛盾在增长
    最近在巴黎连续发生了两桩使美国大为焦虑的事情，一件是法国总理比内拒绝接受美国申斥法国运用美“援”不当的备忘录；另外一件是法国主要政府党之一激进社会党的元老赫里欧、达拉第等人反对批准现有形式的所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约。这些事实说明：美国严重地损害各仆从国家主权的西欧备战计划，使北大西洋侵略集团内部的矛盾不断增加，已经无法掩盖了。
    人们知道：美国利用“经济援助”的幌子，把法国拖进北大西洋侵略集团，并迫使它进行疯狂的扩军备战，以为美国的战争政策服务。法国的统治集团追随美国的战争政策，已使法国陷于严重的经济危机之中，而希望依靠美国的“援助”来解救他们的困难。但是美国却不肯履行在里斯本会议上应承给法国巨额军事订货的诺言，以压迫法国统治集团更顺从地唯美国之命是听。由于比内政府的苦苦哀求和抱怨，美国才答应拨给五亿五千万美元的“援款”，但却要直接干涉这笔款项的用途，借以加紧对法国经济的控制。美国这种横暴的做法，是与法国大资产阶级的利益相冲突的，因而不能不引起法国统治集团的不满。
    法国的遭遇充分暴露了美国利用“经济援助”向各仆从国家进行奴役与掠夺的凶恶面目。美国对于它的仆从国，不仅是“又要马儿好，又要马儿不吃草”，而且还不惜利用它们的困难来加强压力，使各国更进一步地成为美国军事上和经济上的附庸。美国对于法国主权的侵害已愈来愈甚，其咄咄逼人的骄横态度，已到了连奴颜婢膝的比内政府也难以忍受的程度。
    另一方面，比内政府出卖国家主权与民族独立换取美元的政策，已使它面临着严重的政治危机。尤其是它在美国驱使下签订了复活德国军国主义的波恩单独条约和“欧洲防务集团”条约，更激起了法国人民的强烈反对。而美国却不断加紧施行压力，催促法国统治集团批准这两个罪恶的卖国条约。这就使得法国统治集团进退两难，引起了法国资产阶级内部的争吵。
    但是，比内的公然“抗命”，或者赫里欧、达拉第等人的“烦言啧啧”，都并不是什么独立态度的表现。比内已表示希望美国改变援助法国的观念；激进社会党通过的决议，也声明支持“欧洲防务集团”的原则。可见法国的统治集团仍然打算追随美国的战争政策，继续出卖法国民族利益，不过他们企图索取较高的代价，同时想使法国人民相信他们还不完全是美国的奴才。
    尽管比内的反抗只是“跪着的反抗”，尽管赫里欧、达拉第的怨言只是一种“轻微的不满”，巴黎的这两场风波证明了美国和它的法国仆从之间的摩擦是愈来愈尖锐了。这是北大西洋侵略集团无法克服的矛盾，美国八个月以前在里斯本所打的如意算盘正在走向破产。
