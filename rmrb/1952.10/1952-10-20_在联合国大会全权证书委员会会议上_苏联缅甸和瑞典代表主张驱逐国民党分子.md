    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 19th: According to TASS, at the beginning of the meeting on October 17, the United Nations General Assembly Credentials Committee elected Lebanese representative Mikawi as Chairman. The meeting then considered the Secretariat's report on the qualifications of representatives attending the current General Assembly. During the discussion, the Swedish representative announced that he would reserve his vote on the issue of accepting the credentials of the Kuomintang faction because Sweden maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing and does not believe that the "Taiwan government" can represent China.
    Soviet representative Zarubin pointed out that this group cannot be recognized as the representative of the Chinese people at all. Therefore, he put forward a proposal requesting the Credentials Committee not to recognize the credentials of the Kuomintang group, and the committee should submit this decision to the General Assembly.
    The Burmese representative supported the Soviet position and said that Burma can only recognize the representatives of the People's Republic of China and requested the committee to pass the Soviet proposal.
    U.S. representative Gross launched a massive attack on the People's Republic of China and suggested that the General Assembly temporarily refrain from discussing any proposals regarding the expulsion of the Kuomintang faction or the acceptance of representatives of the People's Republic of China during the current session. Panama and New Zealand supported the United States. The committee passed the US proposal with six votes in favor. The Soviet Union, Burma, and Sweden voted against it.
    Subsequently, Zarubin requested the committee to include the Soviet proposal in the minutes of the meeting and the committee's report to the General Assembly. The chairman of the committee agreed. The meeting adjourned.

    在联合国大会全权证书委员会会议上
    苏联缅甸和瑞典代表主张驱逐国民党分子
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：在十月十七日会议开始时，联合国大会全权证书委员会选举了黎巴嫩代表米卡维为主席。然后会议便考虑秘书处的关于出席目前大会的代表的资格的报告。在讨论时，瑞典代表宣布：关于接受国民党分子全权证书问题，他将保留他的投票权，因为瑞典与北京保持有外交关系，并且不认为“台湾政府”能代表中国。
    苏联代表查鲁宾指出：这个集团根本不可能被认作为中国人民的代表，因此他提出一个提案，要求全权证书委员会不承认国民党集团的全权证书，同时该委员会应该向大会提出这个决定。
    缅甸代表支持苏联的态度，并说：缅甸只能承认中华人民共和国的代表，并且要求该委员会通过苏联的提案。
    美国代表葛罗斯向中华人民共和国大肆攻击，并且建议大会在目前会议期间暂不讨论关于驱逐国民党分子或接纳中华人民共和国代表的任何建议。巴拿马与新西兰支持美国。委员会以六票赞成票通过美国的提议。苏联、缅甸与瑞典投票反对。
    随后，查鲁宾要求委员会把苏联的提案包括在会议的记录及委员会给大会的报告里面，委员会主席表示同意。会议至此休会。
