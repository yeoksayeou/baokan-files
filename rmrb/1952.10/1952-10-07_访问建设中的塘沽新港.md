Visiting the Construction of Tanggu New Port
By Our Reporter Lin Li

In the north of our motherland, on the beaches of the Bohai Bay, a grand commercial port—Tanggu New Port—is under construction.

How big is this commercial port exactly? A definite answer is yet to be found. All that can be seen are two tall, solid walls erected in the rolling sea, stretching as far as the eye can see, which people call "breakwaters." To build these breakwaters, half a mountain was cut away from Tangshan and Nankou. Between the two large dikes, a channel tens of miles long has been dug, turning the muddy, yellow seawater into a clear, azure blue. The port construction is not yet complete, and various oddly shaped vessels float inside and outside the channel, these are the main tools for building the port. A type of dredger called "suction-lifting" drags a large "tail" (slurry discharge pipe) several miles long behind it. With its head plunged into the seabed, a large amount of silt is unknowingly transported to land one or two thousand meters away. Another type of dredger called "self-propelled" can dredge 4,700 tons of silt every twenty minutes, its daily work efficiency is equivalent to 18,000 people. There are no fewer than several thousand employees working here, but nowhere can groups or teams of people be seen. It turns out that over 90 percent of this huge construction relies on machinery. Here, the power lines on the sea and the shore are connected, trains and speedboats rush back and forth, and the sound of pneumatic drills and electric welders merges into a deafening roar. This is man fighting the ocean.

Tanggu New Port is located near Tanggu, 45 kilometers southeast of Tianjin. It faces the vast and boundless ocean and is backed by the fertile North China Plain; it is the throat of Tianjin and a hub for international trade and domestic north-south material exchange. This port was initially built by Japanese imperialism during its occupation of China. At that time, it could only accommodate ships of about 3,000 tons. After the Kuomintang bandit gang took over, they did not carry out necessary maintenance and upkeep, the channel silted up into shallow shoals, and the front of the wharf became a flat land. Ships could not navigate, and even wooden sampans could not dock. This renovation is actually starting from scratch. There is no natural terrain to take advantage of here, the water is shallow, and there is a lot of mud, it is entirely built on the beach, so people call it an "artificial port." However, in just one year, 10,000-ton ships can dock here. Its function has far exceeded that of the Japanese occupation period.

Building such a seaport in northern China is necessary. This is also the ideal of the Chinese people for many years. Mr. Sun Yat-sen also advocated building this "world-class" "northern port." Because the abundant products and coal and iron deposits in the north not only occupy an important position in the economic life of the Chinese people but also have a great impact on the international market. In addition to supplying North China, East China, and Central South China, the coal in the North China region is also exported to Japan, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia in large quantities. The cotton in the North China region is equal to half of China's total cotton production. The "Changlu Salt" near Tanggu is sold far to Japan. Qinhuangdao's glass can reach Malaysia and other places. The handicrafts and special products of Beijing and Tianjin are even more welcomed by people all over the world. After liberation, the industrial and agricultural products of the North China region generally reached or exceeded the level before the Anti-Japanese War, and economic crops and special products greatly exceeded the highest records in history. North China requires a large-scale port to exchange goods and materials with both domestic and foreign countries; and a large number of livestock products from Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Inner Mongolia must also be collected, distributed, and exchanged in North China. According to experts' investigations, nearly 100 million people in an area of ​​2 million square kilometers now require a modern port to be built in North China.

The import and export trade in the North China region mainly relied on the port of Tianjin in the past. However, the port of Tianjin relies on a narrow Hai River to communicate with the sea. Ships of more than 3,000 tons cannot enter the port; they must be anchored on the sea more than a hundred miles away, and then loaded and unloaded by barges. Barge loading and unloading not only increases the cost of goods and wastes national property but is also easily attacked by wind and waves, which is extremely dangerous and often delays shipping schedules. After liberation, foreign trade developed, and the difficulties became even more obvious. In this way, many ships that should have docked in Tianjin had to detour to the distant Dalian and Guangzhou to load and unload goods, which greatly increased the turnover time and cost of goods. According to experts' calculations, the loss of loading and unloading by barges is about 170 million catties of millet a year. The loss is even greater by detouring to Dalian and Guangzhou to load and unload. If 170 million catties of millet are used to build Tanggu New Port, a modern seaport capable of berthing 10,000-ton giant ships can be built with surplus. Therefore, the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council decided to build Tanggu New Port in August last year, and at the same time established the Tanggu Port Construction Committee and improved the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau. It was also decided that the first phase of the project should be completed in the winter of 1952, so that 10,000-ton ships could sail into the new port for berthing, loading, and unloading.

Building such a huge seaport is unprecedented in Chinese history. In the past, China's seaports, like other transportation facilities, were all controlled by imperialists. Many seaports were not only invested and operated by imperialists but also construction projects were controlled by them. Therefore, at the beginning of the construction of Tanggu New Port, there was a lack of construction experience and insufficient mature technical personnel. To solve this problem, the port construction personnel here studied with water conservancy experts and university professors in Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Shanghai and invited experts to come and guide them. Some experts and professors provided valuable opinions, and some served as "part-time consultants" or "honorary consultants" of the Port Construction Committee. In this way, they solved many complex technical problems in the survey, design, and construction of Tanggu New Port.

In order to solve the difficulties of general technical workers, Ma Jincheng, director of the New Port Machine Repair Factory, created a new method of "rapidly training apprentices," so that an ordinary worker could master complex port construction techniques after only six months of training. This creation basically solved the difficulty of insufficient machine repair workers. During the same period, the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau launched a mutual teaching movement of old workers teaching new workers and technicians teaching workers. Feng Tai, 66 years old, has more than 40 years of maritime experience and is an extremely difficult diving worker to find. He put on an 18-pound diving helmet, put on a 130-pound diving suit, led young people to the bottom of the sea, and taught a large number of apprentices hand-in-hand, solving the most difficult problem of insufficient diving workers. In addition, the New Port has also cultivated a group of new-type engineering personnel. This is a group of college students. They studied at school before liberation and are now engineers. They can closely integrate with the workers, learn from each other, and improve together. Li Che, a female student from Peking University, is now the director of the third work zone, leading more than 1,500 employees and undertaking the arduous task of rebuilding the new port wharf.

Fighting against seawater and building seaports on the beach is inherently difficult. Tanggu New Port has even more difficulties. Bohai Bay protrudes into the mainland, the water is shallow and there is a lot of mud; Tanggu New Port is also located at the mouth of the Hai River, and the impact of the Hai River sediment increases the difficulty of the new port project. Therefore, before building the seaport wharf, a very deep and long artificial channel must be dug first, and at the same time, two large breakwaters must be built to prevent waves and sediment from impacting. Dredging and blocking mud have become the central topics of building the new port.

Tanggu New Port originally had some modern dredgers. However, the Kuomintang bandit gang took away all they could take when they retreated, and all those they could not take were destroyed and sunk. After liberation, the New Port workers salvaged and repaired nearly 200 destroyed and sunk ships; however, because the dredging task of the New Port was too large, it was still insufficient. For this reason, the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government transferred a large number of dredgers from Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places, and even the "Construction" dredger, known as one of the world's three largest dredgers, was transferred. The strong support of the Central People's Government gave the workers great encouragement. When the construction order was received last year, it was already late autumn and early winter, and the seawater was close to freezing. According to past habits, people could no longer go to sea. But the workers said: "The volunteers can fight in Korea, and we can build ports at sea." In the severe winter, they also launched a vigorous patriotic labor competition like the workers on land. In the past, dredgers worked no more than 16 hours a day, and dredged at most 300 cubic meters of mud per hour; in the patriotic competition, Tanggu No. 4 dredger first created a new record of working 20 hours a day and dredging 733 cubic meters of mud per hour. The record of the No. 4 dredger quickly became the goal of all dredgers. Then, Tanggu No. 5 dredger accepted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and implemented a new method of using one "circulating oil" for 1,500 hours (it only used 300 hours in the past), saving a lot of wealth for the country. In the past, the dredged mud always had more water and less mud, that is, the concentration was not enough; later, accepting the suggestions of Soviet experts, the mud concentration was quickly increased to the Soviet level. Because they overfulfilled the dredging plan, Tanggu New Port further proposed the slogan of letting 10,000-ton ships enter the port two months ahead of schedule.

Tanggu New Port originally had two wharves built by the Japanese, which could berth 3,000-ton ships. This time, it was rebuilt and reinforced on the old foundation to make it able to berth 10,000-ton ships. However, this reconstruction and reinforcement project is the most difficult project. The wharf is close to the sea, and there are warehouses on top of it. There are no drawings and no basis when it was first built, and no one knows where to reinforce it. After research by Soviet experts and Chinese engineering personnel, it was decided to deepen the cement piles in front of the wharf and add "tie rods" (a kind of thick iron rod, using its pulling force) in the middle of the wharf. But the warehouses could not be demolished, and the sea could not be driven away. The work was completely under the seabed and underground that could not be touched or seen. A three-ton steam hammer was used for piling, but it could not be driven in even after more than 20,000 blows; even the wooden pads circled by iron rings were broken one by one, and it could not be driven in. Later, a five-ton steam hammer was replaced, but the problem was still not solved after 3,000 blows. Some would not move at all no matter how you hammered them; some would only drive in one root in two or three days. This wharf is hundreds of meters long, and the cement piles are next to each other. At this rate, it would not be finished in two years. The difficulties encountered in piercing the "tie rods" were even greater. At the beginning, one root could not be pierced in a week; some could not be pierced even if the tie rods were bent and broken. At this time, the New Port Engineering Bureau mobilized all employees to find a way, held large-scale technical symposiums, and organized group discussions. After discussion, the employees put forward nine methods of piercing tie rods, each of which was better than using large machines. For piling, the employees suggested using iron pipes and rubber pipes to connect the water pump before piling, and using the pressure of the water pump to loosen the hard mud around the cement piles, so that seawater could penetrate to loosen the dead mud. As a result, the piling efficiency was increased to 18 piles per day. The tie rod piercing efficiency reached 13 roots per day. The difficulties in reinforcing the wharf project were solved, and there was a guarantee to open the port two months ahead of schedule.

While reinforcing the wharf and dredging the channel, the New Port Engineering Bureau also built a large sluice gate at the mouth of the Hai River. With this sluice gate, 3,000-ton ships can sail directly to Tianjin.

Now, the first phase of the Tanggu New Port project is about to be completed. In another half a month, 10,000-ton ships can enter the port at any time. This wharf can simultaneously berth four 10,000-ton ships and five 3,000-ton ships. There are two coal loaders here, which can fill a 10,000-ton large ship in one day; the cranes on land and water can grab large objects weighing 40 tons at a time. Icebreakers, shipyards, and all modern equipment for berthing 10,000-ton giant ships are almost readily available. Now the employees are enthusiastically looking forward to the arrival of 10,000-ton ships. But this is only the first phase of the new port construction, and it will build larger and better wharves. This first phase of the project has already provided favorable conditions for the growing international trade. It has partially reversed the flow direction of commodities and made the exchange of domestic materials more convenient. This project tells people: the hardworking and brave Chinese people can not only build railways and factories on the mainland but also overcome the ferocious ocean and turn barren beaches into beautiful commercial ports.

    访问建设中的塘沽新港
    本报记者  林里
    在祖国的北方，渤海湾的滩头上，现在正建设着
    一个规模宏大的商港——塘沽新港。
    这个商港究竟有多大？至今还找不到肯定的回答。只见那浪涛翻滚的大海里，竖起了两道高大厚实的墙壁，一眼望不到头，人们叫它“防波堤”。为了建筑这防波堤，曾劈下了唐山、南口两地的半面山。两道大堤之间挖成了几十里长的航道，使混浊浑黄的海水变成了蔚蓝碧绿的清流。建港工程还没有完结，航道内外漂浮着各种奇形怪状的船只，这是建筑港口的主要工具。一种叫做“吸扬式”的挖泥船，后边拖着几里长的粗大“尾巴”（排泥管）。船头往海底一扎，大量的淤泥便神不知、鬼不觉地输送到一、两千公尺以外的陆地上去了。另一只叫做“自航式”的挖泥船，每二十分钟左右能挖去四千七百吨淤泥，它一天的工作效率等于一万八千个人。在这里工作的职工人员不下数千名，但那里都看不到成群或成队的人。原来这个巨大建筑的百分之九十以上的工程是靠机械来做的。在这里，海上和岸上的电线联在一起，火车和快艇往来奔驰，风镐和电焊机的冲激声，汇成震耳欲聋的巨响。这是人和海洋在搏斗。
    塘沽新港在天津东南四十五公里的塘沽附近。它面对着广阔无垠的海洋，背靠着物产丰富的华北大平原；它是天津的咽喉，国际贸易和国内南北物资交流的枢纽。这个港最初是日本帝国主义在占领中国时期建筑的。那时只能停泊三千吨左右的轮船。国民党匪帮接管后，没有进行必要的维护和保养，航道淤成了浅水滩，码头前面堆成了平地。轮船不能航行了，木船舢板也不能靠岸了。这次修建，实际上是从头做起。这里没有可以利用的自然地形，水浅，泥多，完全是在海滩上建筑，因此人们叫它“人工港”。但是，仅仅一年功夫，万吨的轮船就能够在这里停泊靠岸了。它的功用已远远超过日本统治时期。
    在我国的北方，建筑这样一个海港是必要的。这也是我国人民多少年来的理想。孙中山先生也曾主张建设这个“世界性”的“北方大港”。因为北方的丰富物产和煤铁矿藏，不仅在我国人民经济生活上占有重要地位，对于国际市场也有极大影响。华北区的煤炭除供应华北、华东和中南以外，还大量输出日本、香港和南洋。华北区的棉花，等于我国产棉总数的一半。塘沽附近的“长芦盐”远销日本。秦皇岛的玻璃可以到达马来亚等地。北京和天津的手工艺品与特产品，更为世界各国人民所欢迎。解放以后，华北区的工农业产品一般都达到或超过了抗日战争以前的水平，经济作物和特产品更大大超过了历史上的最高纪录。华北要求有一个大规模的港口，以便和国内外进行商品交换交流物资；而陕西、甘肃、宁夏、内蒙古等地的大量畜产，也要在华北集散和交换。据专家们调查，现在有二百万平方公里土地上将近一亿的人口要求在华北建筑一个近代化的港口。
    华北区的出入口贸易，水路方面过去主要是依靠天津港口。而天津港却是靠一条狭窄的海河沟通大海。三千吨以上的轮船即不能入港；必须停泊在百多里地以外的海面上，然后再用驳船装卸。驳船装卸不但提高了商品成本，浪费了国家资财，而且容易受风浪袭击，危险极大，并常常延误船运航期。解放后对外贸易发展了，困难就越发明显。这样，许多应该在天津停泊的船就不得不绕到遥远的大连、广州去装卸货物，这又大大增加了商品的周转时间和费用。据专家们计算，用驳船装卸的损失，一年约一亿七千万斤小米。绕到大连、广州装卸，则损失更大。如果拿一亿七千万斤小米修建塘沽新港，则可修成停泊万吨巨轮的近代化海港而有余。于是，中央人民政府政务院在去年八月决定修建塘沽新港，同时成立了塘沽建港委员会，健全了塘沽新港工程局。并决定一九五二年冬天要完成第一期工程，使万吨轮船能够驶入新港停泊装卸。
    修建这样巨大的海港，在我国历史上尚无先例。过去，我国的海港也和其他交通设备一样，全都掌握在帝国主义手里。许多海港不但是由帝国主义者投资经营，修建工程也由他们把持操纵。因此在修建塘沽新港之初，既缺乏建筑的经验，也没有足够的成熟的技术人员。为解决这一问题，这里的建港人员曾向北京、天津、唐山、上海的水利专家和大学教授学习，请专家们前来指导。专家和教授们有的提供了宝贵的意见，有的担任了建港委员会的
    “兼职顾问”或“义务顾问”。就这样，他们解决了塘沽新港建设中的勘察、设计和施工中的许多复杂技术问题。
    为了解决一般技术工人的困难，新港机修厂厂长马金城创造了“快速训练艺徒”的新方法，使一个普通工人只要经过六个月的训练，就能掌握复杂的建港技术。这一创造基本上解决了机修工人不足的困难。同一时期，塘沽新港工程局发动了老工人教新工人、技术人员教工人的互教运动。六十六岁的冯泰，有四十多年的海上生活经验，是极不容易寻找的潜水工人。他戴起十八斤重的潜水帽，穿起一百三十多斤重的潜水衣，带领着年青人沉到海底，手把着手教会了大批徒弟，解决了最棘手的潜水工人不足的难题。另外，新港还培养了一批新型的工程人员。这是一批大学生。他们解放以前在学校念书，现在当了工程师。他们能和工人紧密地结合在一起，互相学习，提高。北京大学女生李彻，现在担任着第三工区的主任，领导着一千五百多名职工，担负着改建新港码头的繁重任务。
    同海水搏斗，在海滩上建筑海港，本来就很艰难。塘沽新港则困难更多。渤海湾突入大陆，水浅泥多；塘沽新港又地处海河出口，海河泥沙的冲激更增加了新港工程的困难。因此在建筑海港码头以前，要先挖下很深很长的人工航道，同时修筑两道很大的防波堤，以防波澜和泥沙的冲激。挖泥和堵泥，成了建筑新港的中心课题。
    塘沽新港原有一些近代化的挖泥船。但国民党匪帮在撤退时把能带的全部带走了，不能带的也全都击毁沉没了。解放后，新港职工曾先后打捞和修复了将近二百只被击毁和沉没的船；但因新港挖泥任务过大，仍然不足应用。为此，中央人民政府交通部从天津、上海、南京等地调来大批挖泥船，连素称世界三大挖泥船之一的“建设号”也调来了。中央人民政府的大力支持，给职工以很大鼓舞。去年接到建港命令时，已是秋末冬初，海水已接近冰冻期。按照以往习惯，人是不能再下海了。但工人们说：“志愿军能在朝鲜打仗，我们就能在海上建港。”在严寒的冬天，他们也和陆地上的工人们一样，展开了轰轰烈烈的爱国主义劳动竞赛。过去挖泥船每天工作不过十六小时，每小时挖泥顶多三百立方公尺；在爱国主义竞赛中，塘沽四号挖泥船首先创造了一天工作二十小时，每小时挖泥七百三十三立方公尺的新纪录。四号挖泥船的纪录，很快成了所有挖泥船的奋斗目标。接着，塘沽五号挖泥船接受苏联先进经验，实行了填一次“循环油”能用一千五百小时的新办法（过去只用三百个小时），给国家节省了大量财富。以往挖出的泥总是水多泥少，即浓度不够；以后接受苏联专家的建议，挖泥浓度很快提高到了苏联水平。因为他们超额完成了挖泥计划，塘沽新港进而提出提前两月让万吨轮船进港的口号。
    塘沽新港原有日本人修筑的两个码头，能停泊三千吨的轮船。这次是在旧的基础上改建和加固，使其能够停泊万吨轮船。但这个改建和加固的工程，却是最困难的工程。码头紧靠大海，上面是一幢幢的仓库。初建时的图样和根据一点没有，谁也弄不清该从那里加固。经过苏联专家和中国工程人员研究，决定把码头前面的水泥桩加深，再把码头中间加上“拉杆”（一种粗大的铁棍，利用其拉力）。但既不能拆掉仓库，又不能赶走大海。工作完全是在摸不到又看不见的海底和地底。打桩用的是三吨重的大汽锤，但连打两万多下打不进去；甚至把铁圈圈起来的木垫一个一个都打碎了，也打不进去。以后换成五吨重的大汽锤，连打三千下，仍不解决问题。有的任你怎样锤打，根本不动；有的两三天才打进去一根。这个码头长达数百公尺，水泥桩一个挨着一个，按这样的速度打去，两年也打不完。穿“拉杆”中碰到的困难更大，开始时一星期还穿不进一根去；有的把拉杆顶弯顶断了也穿不进去。这时，新港工程局动员全体职工想办法，召开大规模的技术座谈会议，又组织小组讨论。经过讨论，职工们提出了九种穿拉杆的办法，每一种都比用大机器好。对于打桩，职工们提议在打桩前用铁管和胶皮管接联水泵，利用水泵的压力，把水泥桩周围的硬泥吹松，使海水浸入，以松动死泥。这样做的结果，打桩效率提高到一天十八根。穿拉杆效率达到一天十三根。加固码头工程的困难解决了，提前两月开港就有了保证。
    在加固码头、疏浚航道工程的同时，新港工程局还在海河口上修了一个大水闸。有了这个水闸，三千吨的轮船可以直驶天津。
    现在，塘沽新港第一期工程即将完成。再有半个月，万吨轮船就可以随时入港了。这个码头可以同时停泊四只万吨轮船和五只三千吨的轮船。这里有两部装煤机，一天可以装满载万吨的大轮船；陆上和水上的起重机，一下可以抓取四十吨重的大东西。破冰船，修船厂，一切停泊万吨巨轮的近代化设备几乎应有尽有。现在职工们正热情地期待着万吨轮的来临。但这仅仅是新港建筑的第一期工程，它还要修筑更大和更好的码头。就这第一期工程，也已经给日益发展的国际贸易提供了有利条件。局部地扭转了商品的流转方向，使国内物资的交流更加便利。这一工程告诉人们：勤劳而勇敢的中国人民不仅能够在大陆上修铁路，开工厂，也能够战胜凶恶的海洋，使荒凉的海滩变成美丽的商港。
