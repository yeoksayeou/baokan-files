The National Day this year brings us even greater joy. The people of the whole country are enthusiastically celebrating the victories and achievements of the motherland in various aspects over the past three years. In June 1950, Chairman Mao called on the people of the whole country and governments at all levels to work together, striving for a fundamental improvement in the state's financial and economic situation within three years or a little more. It has not even been three years, and Chairman Mao's call has already been realized. The national land reform has been basically completed, industrial and agricultural production has recovered and partially exceeded the highest level in Chinese history, fiscal revenue and expenditure have been balanced, and prices have been completely stabilized. We have victoriously completed the economic recovery work and laid the foundation for large-scale economic construction in the future.

In the past three years, in terms of domestic trade, state-owned commerce, cooperative commerce, and private commerce have all developed under the correct policy of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government. They have played an active role in stabilizing prices, activating urban-rural exchange, expanding the domestic market, and supporting the restoration and development of production. Now, I will explain them separately as follows:

I. Prices are completely stabilized

The first task we have accomplished in the past three years is to achieve complete price stability.

Our people have suffered greatly from the soaring prices during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. The Kuomintang reactionary government adopted a policy of massively issuing currency to plunder the people, causing national prices to rise wildly, which greatly damaged China's economy and turned people's lives into extreme poverty.

After liberation, stabilizing prices was the urgent demand of the vast majority of people. After the establishment of the Central People's Government on October 1, 1949, it regarded stabilizing prices as one of the primary tasks; however, at the beginning of liberation, it was difficult to immediately change the chaotic situation of the entire social economy, and the toxins left over from long-term inflation were still causing trouble. Therefore, prices still fluctuated in 1949. We first fought against speculators and gradually suppressed the fierce flames of rapidly rising prices. In March 1950, after careful preparation, we carried out large-scale measures to stabilize prices from finance, trade, banking and other aspects, so that national prices were basically stabilized. In September 1951, after the national state-owned trading institutions, under the leadership of governments at all levels, resolutely implemented the central government's decision on stabilizing prices, prices were further moved from basic stability to complete stability. The threat of soaring prices that the people of the whole country had suffered for many years has been completely lifted, and favorable conditions have been created for future economic construction. The national wholesale price index, taking March 1950 as 100, was 88.60 in December 1950, 101.30 in September 1951, 100.30 in December 1951, and 95.20 in June 1952, which shows that China's prices have been basically stable for more than two years, and now they have reached complete stability.

Our price policy starts from taking care of the interests of production, transporters, and consumers. It not only takes into account historical conditions and the current local situation, but also takes into account the long-term and comprehensive development prospects. Although the prices of certain industrial products still have the disadvantage of being too high, and the regional price differences and wholesale and retail price differences between some small towns are not very normal, in general, we have mastered the regional price differences, seasonal price differences, wholesale and retail price differences, quality price differences, the price ratio of cash crops to grain, and the price ratio of industrial products to agricultural products in major cities across the country according to correct policies, and have made reasonable adjustments in a timely manner, which has achieved the effect of stabilizing prices and helping production development.

A reasonable price policy has encouraged industrial and agricultural production; among them, it has particularly significantly encouraged the increased production of cash crops and export specialties such as cotton, flue-cured tobacco, hemp, wool, and tea. In the past two or three years, reasonable price ratios between cotton and grain, and between tobacco and grain, have made cotton production in 1952 three times that of 1949, changing the past situation of the cotton textile industry relying on foreign cotton supplies and achieving basic self-sufficiency. The output of flue-cured tobacco in 1952 was about twice that of 1950, and it has also changed from relying on imports in the past to being available for export. Of course, the completion of these tasks depends on the correct leadership of governments at all levels, the diligent production increase of the vast number of farmers, and the close combination of various departments in helping farmers in terms of loans, seeds, and farmers actively fighting against various disasters, but the correct price policy has played a certain role.

Reasonable price policies, reasonable regional price differences, and wholesale and retail price differences have also had a major impact on encouraging private business transportation and operation.

A reasonable price policy also takes care of the interests of the vast number of consumers. In the past two or three years, in addition to stabilizing the prices of bulk materials related to people's lives such as grain, cloth, and coal, we have also paid attention to stabilizing the retail prices of various daily necessities for the people. Although the proportion of private operation in retail commerce is currently very large, and the government's policy also allows and encourages them to actively operate, retail prices directly affect the interests of the vast number of consumers, especially workers and wage earners, so they must never be allowed to run wild. In order to stabilize retail prices, the state has established state-owned retail companies, which operate some important commodities related to people's lives, and strengthened market management administratively. Now the retail prices in the market are also stable.

Because the state has mastered various important materials and implemented a correct price policy, the listed prices of state-owned trading companies have taken a leading position in the market.

II. Urban-rural exchange has been widely carried out

In the past three years, the domestic market has been continuously expanding. Not only have many old commercial routes been restored, but also new commercial routes and new commercial activities have been opened up.

The national commodity turnover is increasing year by year. Taking 1950 as 100, it was about 130 in 1951, and the estimated minimum is 170 in 1952. The sales volume of national agricultural products, by-products, and various major commodities is constantly expanding, as shown in the table below. In three years, the sales volume of grain, cotton cloth, and kerosene has increased by about 150%, and the sales volume of other major commodities has generally increased by about 50%.

National Index of Total Sales of Agricultural Products, By-products, and Various Major Commodities

| Commodity | 1950 | 1951 | 1952 (Estimated) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agricultural Products, By-products and Handicrafts | 100 | 138.66 | 148.61 |
| Grain ★ | 100 | 170.21 | 271.28 |
| Cotton Yarn | 100 | 131.90 | 171.43 |
| Cotton Cloth ★ | 100 | 167.27 | 245.76 |
| Coal | 100 | 115.80 | 141.86 |
| Kerosene | 100 | 108.90 | 262.67 |
| Salt | 100 | 142.35 | 152.89 |
| Cigarettes | 100 | 112.06 | 149.41 |

(Note: Those with ★ are the quantities supplied by the state to the national market)

In coordination with the restoration and development of China's industrial and agricultural production, state-owned trading companies, in conjunction with cooperatives and leading private businesses, have successfully carried out the work of restoring the market and developing urban-rural exchange.

In the summer of 1950, after prices changed from continuous fluctuations for more than ten years to stability, the market once showed a sluggish situation due to the disappearance of false purchasing power. State-owned trading institutions, on the one hand, helped legitimate private industrial and commercial enterprises overcome the difficulties of the transformation period by purchasing inventory, processing, and ordering in cities; at the same time, they purchased a large amount of agricultural products and by-products, supported and encouraged cooperatives and private businesses to participate in urban-rural exchange, and started by opening up sales channels for unsalable local products, making the market gradually shift from sluggish to active.

In our work of urban-rural exchange, we focus on improving the purchasing power of farmers, improving the lives of the vast number of farmers, and enabling industrial products to obtain a vast domestic market. The methods we have adopted are, on the one hand, to actively purchase local products, promote local products, and help unsalable materials open up sales channels, so that farmers' income increases. On the other hand, it is to encourage industrial production to face the countryside, actively demand that industry improve management, reduce costs, and lower prices, so as to open up the sales channels of industrial products in the vast countryside.

The experience of 1950 shows the importance of urban-rural exchange to social and economic recovery. Whether many industrial products can sell well mainly depends on the vast countryside. As long as farmers' purchasing power continues to increase, industry can recover and develop. Therefore, the urban-rural exchange movement was carried out more widely in 1951. In this year, material exchange conferences were held throughout the country, and more than 14,000 contracts and agreements were signed at the conferences, with a total transaction value of more than 10 trillion yuan in Renminbi. In 1952, on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the material exchange movement continued to be consolidated and expanded. The results of exchange conferences in various places have exceeded those in 1951, and provinces, special zones, and counties have held small-scale exchange conferences, creating many new forms. According to incomplete statistics, as of July, the transaction value of exchange conferences in various places has reached more than 9.6 trillion yuan. It is expected that the material exchange movement will be carried out on a larger scale after entering the peak season of autumn and winter.

The urban-rural material exchange movement in 1952 has had many important developments compared with the past. First of all, governments at all levels not only called for but also effectively led and organized this work. Trade, finance, tax bureaus, customs, transportation, and other departments were closely integrated, so that a series of measures to activate exchange, such as adjusting regional price differences, appropriately relaxing market management, purchasing unsalable goods, supplying fast-selling goods, reducing interest rates, expanding loans, and facilitating tax procedures, were concentratedly expressed through exchange conferences, encouraging private businesses to participate in exchange politically and economically. Secondly, the exchange conferences in primary markets have greatly developed, linking large cities, medium and small cities, and primary markets. Conducting internal and external exchange at the same time at the exchange conference in Central and South China is also an important new development in this year's exchange conference. Third, the planning of this year's exchange conference has been strengthened, the purchase and sale plan is more practical than before, the contract transactions and spot cash transactions have increased, and the agreements have decreased, indicating that the state-owned economy's leadership of the market has been further strengthened and consolidated.

The experience of the past two years shows that the urban-rural material exchange conference has become an important way of commercial activity in China at present. It is conducive to solving the contradiction between production and sales, stimulating production development, enabling both public and private businesses to fully exert their effectiveness, and strengthening the planning of the country's leadership of the market.

III. The situation of private industry and commerce

In the past three years, the state-owned economy has established a solid leading position over other economic components. Cooperatives have developed substantially with the support of the state-owned economy. The state-owned economy's leadership over private industry and commerce has been greatly strengthened, which guarantees the victorious development of China's new democratic economic construction. But this does not mean that private industry and commerce will not be able to develop. On the contrary, those parts that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood will still have a certain development in a long period of time to come. The state will continue to provide assistance and encourage its enthusiasm for operation. In the past three years, private industry and commerce have also made significant progress under the strong leadership of the state-owned economy. At the same time, through adjustment, unified purchase and sales, processing and ordering, negotiated pricing and price verification, public-private joint ventures and other methods and the "Five-Anti" movement, the state's education and transformation of private industrialists and merchants has gradually embarked on the track stipulated by the Common Program.

Chinese private industry and commerce were originally extremely weak and very deformed under the long-term oppression of imperialism and the devastation of the Kuomintang bureaucratic comprador group. After liberation, the industry and commerce that used to rely on imperialism and the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital and serve them could no longer exist; after prices began to stabilize, the once rampant speculative atmosphere was fatally hit, speculative commerce must change its business, and private industry and commerce carried out preliminary reorganization on this basis. In May 1950, under the principle of developing production and gradually strengthening market planning, the People's Government carried out the work of industrial and commercial adjustment. And according to the requests of private manufacturers, state-owned trading institutions implemented processing and ordering to them, and at the same time, purchased a large amount of agricultural products and by-products, developed urban-rural exchange, and enabled the reorganized private industry and commerce to quickly recover. Taking the seven major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an as examples, in the first half of 1950, 12,752 private industrial and commercial enterprises reported to the government that they had opened, and 18,847 reported that they had closed. In the second half of the year, 31,509 reported that they had opened, and only 6,736 reported that they had closed. The turnover of private industry and commerce in the second half of the year also increased significantly compared with the first half of the year. In 1951, with the strengthening of leadership by governments at all levels and the state-owned economy, the division of labor and cooperation between the public and private economies became closer, and private industry and commerce also achieved further development. Taking the above-mentioned seven major cities as an example, at the end of 1951, the number of private industrial and commercial enterprises increased by 20% compared with the end of 1950, of which private industry increased by 33% and private commerce increased by 15%.

In 1952, after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, private industry and commerce were further transformed and adjusted. The old social dirt that hindered the country's progress has been thoroughly exposed and largely eliminated, and the national atmosphere has been renewed. This is extremely beneficial to the country's economic construction and the development of legitimate private industry and commerce. In June of this year, the preparatory representative meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce was held in Beijing. Private industrialists and merchants have further united and organized, and have generally carried out the study of the Common Program throughout the country. These will enable private industry and commerce to embark on a path of sound development. Chen Yun, Vice Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government, put forward a general outline at this meeting on how to calculate the reasonable profit for processing and ordering in the future, believing that it is necessary to calculate according to the capital of private factories under different circumstances. Under normal and reasonable operation, there can be profits of about 10%, about 20%, and about 30%. This regulation has been warmly welcomed by private industrialists and merchants.

The processing and ordering of state-owned trading enterprises to private manufacturers is a good way to take care of both public and private interests. It can not only strengthen the planning of production and the market and strengthen the leadership of state-owned enterprises over private enterprises, but also solve the difficulties of raw material supply and finished product sales for private manufacturers, and ensure their reasonable profits. As far as private manufacturers are concerned, undertaking the state's processing and ordering is undoubtedly the most stable and reliable operation. Comparing it with the risky blind operation in the old society, everyone can come to such a conclusion. At present, state-owned enterprises are expanding processing and ordering to private manufacturers. From March to June 1952, the amount of processing, ordering, and purchasing of Shanghai's private factories increased by 100% compared with the same period in 1951, accounting for 80% of the total turnover of Shanghai's private factories, involving more than 7,000 factories. In Tianjin and other places, the amount of processing and ordering also accounted for 60% of the total turnover of private factories. More than half of Guangzhou's private factories undertake the state's processing and ordering. In the future, as long as private industrialists can meet the requirements of national construction, actively improve their management, and no longer commit the "five poisons," their development is guaranteed. In terms of private commerce, the People's Government allows the freedom of domestic trade within the unified economic plan of the state (Article 37 of the Common Program), and is encouraging and organizing them to actively participate in urban-rural exchange and internal and external exchange. At present, only a few commodities are subject to unified purchase and sales by the state, and unified purchase products can still be allocated to private businesses for distribution, and unified sales export products can also be entrusted to private businesses for operation. Their scope of operation is very broad.

IV. The development of trade with ethnic minorities

In order to promote the exchange of materials between various ethnic minority areas and other parts of the country, help ethnic minority people develop production, improve their living standards, state-owned trade departments, according to the instructions of the People's Government, have successively established retail stores, purchasing stations, processing plants, and mobile trade teams of state-owned trading companies in various ethnic minority areas. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 1,100 units in the past three years, helping ethnic minority people sell a large number of livestock products and other local specialties, supplying them with the means of production and living they need, supporting the establishment and development of cooperatives, and uniting legitimate private businesses to jointly expand the commercial network in ethnic minority areas. The Central People's Government also convened a national ethnic trade conference in Beijing in August 1951, making the ethnic minority trade in various regions further developed.

State-owned trading institutions first raised the purchase prices of major products in each region, such as livestock products, and changed the long-term unreasonable phenomenon of the exchange ratio between products in ethnic minority areas and general commodities in the past. For example, the exchange rate of wool per 100 jin and cloth in Xining, Qinghai: before liberation, it was 25 feet, and in December 1951 it had been increased to 303 feet; the exchange rate with tea bricks: before liberation, it was 1.5 packs, and in December 1951 it was 14 packs; the exchange rate with millet: before liberation, it was 375 jin, and in December 1951 it was 1,312 jin. Wool in Xikang exchanged for tea: before liberation, 100 jin of wool could be exchanged for 3 packs of tea, and after liberation, it could be exchanged for more than 8 packs. One ton of grain in Inner Mongolia could be exchanged for half a bolt of cloth in 1947, and 2.22 bolts of cloth in 1950. For example, in the Miao area in western Hunan, 100 jin of tung oil could be exchanged for 100 jin of salt before liberation, and 300 jin in August 1950. In the Miao area of Dading, Guizhou, 100 jin of tung oil could be exchanged for 23 jin of salt before liberation, and 160 jin in 1951.

Due to the reasonable increase in purchase prices and large-scale purchases, the production of livestock products and other special products in various ethnic minority areas has been stimulated, people's income has increased, and purchasing power has increased. Therefore, the lives of various ethnic groups have also been greatly improved.

The output of livestock products in ethnic minority areas in Northwest China in 1951 increased by 50% compared with 1948 before liberation. The annual wool production of the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai in the Northwest Region, taking the highest 1933 before the Anti-Japanese War as 100, is 110 this year. The number of livestock in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has doubled since liberation (it used to take 15 to 20 years to double). The percentage increase in various livestock in 1951 compared with 1950: cattle increased by 15%, sheep increased by 17%, and goats increased by 65%.

The purchasing power of herdsmen in Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces in Northwest China has generally increased by six to seven times compared with before liberation. Among the 5,000 people contacted by a mobile trade team, 80% of the people have changed into new clothes. Salt and tea, which were extremely scarce in ethnic minority areas before liberation, have now become consumer goods commonly used by ethnic minority people. At the same time, state-owned trading institutions supplied a large number of necessities. The supply of tea to ethnic minority areas in Northwest China increased by 9 times in 1951 compared with 1950. In Xikang Province, tea sales in 1951 increased by 394% compared with 1950.

Under the correct ethnic trade policy and the support and leadership of state-owned trade, the commercial network in ethnic minority areas has gradually expanded, and the local private industry and commerce have also been developing smoothly. For example, the number of private industrial and commercial households in Xining and other eight counties and cities in Qinghai Province was 1,662 before liberation, and increased to 3,944 in 1951. In Dingyuanying, Ningxia, there were only 49 industrial and commercial households before liberation, and it increased to 299 in August 1951.

The development of trade in ethnic minority areas has played a great role in promoting the unity of all ethnic groups and the improvement of economy and culture.

In summary, in the past three years, due to the complete stabilization of prices, the wide development of urban-rural exchange, and the correct adjustment of public-private relations, the market has become increasingly prosperous, promoting the restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production, and laying a good foundation for long-term economic construction in the future. In the future, China's production will be more developed, material exchange will be more expanded, and the tasks of trade will be more important. Therefore, all operations and measures must be carried out under the unified planned leadership of the state to serve economic construction. The victories and achievements of China in various aspects in the past three years have made the people of the whole country more confident in completing the glorious historical tasks under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and have also seen their far-reaching future.

    三年来全国商业的调整与发展
    中央人民政府商业部副部长  姚依林
    今年的国庆节给我们带来了更大的喜悦，全国人民热烈欢呼着祖国三年来各方面的胜利与成就。毛主席在一九五○年六月号召全国人民与各级政府共同努力；在三年或三年多一些的时期内，争取国家财政经济状况的根本好转。现在还不到三年，毛主席的号召已经实现了。全国土地改革已经基本完成，工农业生产已经恢复并部分超过中国历史上最高水平，财政收支已经平衡，物价已经完全稳定。我们已经胜利地完成了经济恢复工作，并为今后的大规模经济建设打下了基础。
    三年来，在国内贸易方面，国营商业、合作社商业与私营商业，在中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的正确方针下，在毛主席及中央人民政府的正确领导下，都有了发展，并在稳定物价，活跃城乡交流，扩大国内市场，扶助生产的恢复与发展等方面，发挥了积极的作用。现在分别地加以说明如下：
    一、物价完全稳定了
    三年来，我们做到的第一件工作，就是取得了物价的完全稳定。
    我国人民曾受尽蒋介石反动统治时代物价飞涨的痛苦。蒋介石反动政府，采取了大量发行通货以掠夺人民的政策，使全国物价疯狂上涨，使我国经济受到极大破坏，人民生活变成极端贫困。
    解放后，稳定物价是全国广大人民的迫切要求。中央人民政府在一九四九年十月一日成立后，就把稳定物价当作首要工作之一；但在解放之初，整个社会经济的混乱局面一下子还难于立刻改变，长期通货膨胀所遗留下来的毒素还在作怪，故一九四九年物价仍有波动，我们首先与投机家进行了斗争，逐步将物价飞速上涨的凶焰抑制下来。并于一九五○年三月，在经过了周密的准备之后，从财政、贸易、银行等各方面进行了大规模的稳定物价的措施，使全国物价基本上稳定下来，一九五一年九月全国国营贸易机构在各级人民政府领导下，在坚决执行中央关于稳定物价的决定以后，更进一步使物价由基本的稳定进入完全的稳定。全国人民多年来所受物价狂涨的威胁从此完全解除了，并为今后的经济建设创造了有利的条件。全国批发物价总指数，如以一九五○年三月为一○○，则一九五○年十二月为八八·六○，一九五一年九月为一○一·三○，一九五一年十二月为一○○·三○，一九五二年六月为九五·二○，这说明了两年多来我国物价基本上是稳定的，而现在更达到了完全的稳定。
    我们的物价政策是从照顾生产事业、贩运者和消费者三方面的利益出发的。既照顾历史条件与当时当地情况，又照顾到长远的全面的发展前途。虽然目前某些工业品价格还存在着偏高的缺点，某些小城镇间地区差价与批发零售差价还不很正常，但一般的说，我们已在全国各大城市间，根据正确政策掌握了地区差价、季节差价、批发零售差价、质量差价、经济作物与粮食比价，工业品与农业品比价，并及时作了合理调节，收到了稳定物价及帮助生产发展的效果。
    合理的价格政策，鼓励了工业农业生产；其中特别显著的如鼓励了棉花、烤烟、麻、羊毛及茶叶等经济作物和出口特产的增产。两三年来，合理的棉粮、烟粮比价，使一九五二年棉花产量达到一九四九年的三倍，改变了过去棉纺工业依靠外棉供应的局面而达到基本自给。烤烟产量，一九五二年约比一九五○年增产二倍，亦由过去依靠进口改变为可供出口。当然，这些任务的完成，有赖于各级人民政府的正确领导，广大农民的勤劳增产，和各部门在贷款、种籽方面对农民的帮助，农民积极和各种灾害作斗争等许多方面密切的结合，但正确的物价政策是起了一定的作用的。
    合理的价格政策，合理的地区差价与批发零售差价，对于鼓励私商贩运经营，也发生了重大的影响。
    合理的价格政策也照顾了广大消费者的利益。两三年来我们除稳定粮、布、煤等有关人民生活的大宗物资的价格外，并注意稳定各种人民日用必需品的零售价格。虽然目前零售商业的私人经营比重很大，而政府的政策也准许并鼓励他们积极经营，但因零售价格直接影响广大消费者，特别是工薪劳动者的利益，因此绝不能任其自流。为了稳定零售价格，国家设立了国营零售公司，经营了一些有关人民生活的重要商品，并从行政上加强市场管理。现在市场的零售价格也是稳定的。
    由于国家掌握了各种重要物资，并执行了正确的物价政策，国营贸易公司的牌价已在市场上取得了领导地位。
    二、广泛开展了城乡交流
    三年来国内市场正不断扩大，不但许多旧有的商业路线已经恢复，并且开辟了新的商业路线与新的商业活动方式。
    全国商品流转额在逐年增加中，如以一九五○年为一○○，则一九五一年约为一三○，一九五二年预计最低为一七○。全国农产品、副产品及各种主要商品的销售量正在不断扩大，如下表所示，三年中粮食、棉布、煤油增加了百分之一百五十左右，其他各主要商品一般都增加了百分之五十左右。全国农产品、副产品及各种主要商品销售总量指数农产品、副产品    一九五○年    一九五一年    一九五二年（预计）及手工业品    一○○    一三八·六六    一四八·六一粮食★    一○○    一七○·二一    二七一·二八棉纱    一○○    一三一·九○    一七一·四三棉    布★    一○○  
  一六七·二七    二四五·七六煤炭    一○○    一一五·八○
    一四一·八六煤油    一○○    一○八·九○    二六二·六七食    盐    一○○    一四二·三五    一五二·八九纸    烟
    一○○    一一二·○六    一四九·四一（注：有★号者为国家对全国市场供应数量）
    配合着我国工农业生产的恢复与发展，国营贸易公司结合合作社并领导着私商，胜利地进行了恢复市场与发展城乡交流的工作。
    一九五○年夏季，物价由连续十几年的波动转为稳定之后，由于虚假购买力的消失，市场一度呈现呆滞局面。国营贸易机构一面在城市用收购存货、加工、订货等办法帮助了正当的私营工商业度过改造时期的困难；同时大量收购农产品与副产品，扶助并鼓励合作社及私商参加城乡交流，从打开滞销土产的销路着手，使市场逐渐由呆滞转向活跃。
    我们在城乡交流工作中，着重在提高农民的购买力，改善广大农民的生活，使工业品获得广大的国内市场。我们所采取的办法，就是一方面积极收购土产，推销土产，帮助滞销物资打开销路，使农民收入增加。另一方面，则是鼓励工业生产面向农村，积极要求工业改善经营，减低成本，降低价格，以打开工业品在广大农村中的销路。
    一九五○年的经验说明了城乡交流对于社会经济恢复的重要性，许多工业品的能否畅销，主要决定于广大农村，只要农民的购买力不断提高，工业就能恢复与发展。因而一九五一年更广泛地开展了城乡交流运动。这一年中，全国各地普遍举行了物资交流大会，在会场内共签订了一万四千余件的合同与协议，成交总额人民币十万余亿元。一九五二年，在“三反”“五反”运动胜利的基础上继续巩固与扩大物资交流运动。各地交流大会的成绩都超过一九五一年，各省、专区、县并纷纷举行了小型交流会，创造了许多新的形式。据不完全统计，到七月份止，各地交流大会的成交额已达九万六千余亿元，预计进入秋冬旺季后，物资交流运动将有更大规模的开展。
    一九五二年的城乡物资交流运动比过去有了许多重要的发展。首先，是各地人民政府不仅号召了而且切实领导和组织了这一工作，贸易、金融、税局、海关、交通、运输等密切结合起来，使调整地区差价，适当放宽市场管理，收购滞销品，供应顺销货，降低利息，扩大贷款以及便利征税手续等一系列活跃交流的措施，都通过交流大会集中表现出来，从政治上与经济上鼓励了私商参加交流。其次是初级市场的交流大会有很大发展，使大城市、中小城市与初级市场联系起来。在中南区交流大会上同时进行了内外交流，也是今年交流大会的一项重要的新发展。第三是今年交流会的计划性增强，购销计划较前切实，合同成交及现货现款交易增多，协议减少，说明国营经济对市场的领导已经进一步加强与巩固了。
    两年来的经验说明，城乡物资交流大会已成为目前我国商业活动的一项重要方式。有利于解决产销矛盾，刺激生产发展，使公私商业都能充分发挥效能，并加强国家对市场领导的计划性。
    三、私营工商业的情况
    三年来国营经济已对其他经济成分确立了巩固的领导地位。合作社在国营经济扶助下已大量发展。国营经济对私营工商业的领导已大大加强，这就保证了我国新民主主义经济建设的胜利发展。但这并不等于说私营工商业将不能发展，相反地，其中有利于国计民生的部分，在今后一个长时期内仍将有
    一定的发展。国家仍将给以帮助，并鼓励其经营积极性。三年来私营工商业在强大的国营经济领导下，亦已有了显著的发展。同时经过调整、统购、统销、加工订货、议价核价、公私合营等方式及
    “五反”运动国家对私营工商业者的教育与改造，已逐渐走上共同纲领所规定的轨道。
    中国私营工商业在长期的帝国主义压迫与蒋介石官僚买办集团的摧残下，本来是极度虚弱和十分畸形的。解放后，过去依靠帝国主义和蒋介石官僚资本并为他们服务的工商业已无法继续存在；物价开始稳定后，过去猖狂一时的投机风气受到致命的打击，投机商业必须改业，私营工商业就在这个基础之上进行了初步的改组。一九五○年五月，人民政府在发展生产与逐步加强市场计划性的原则下，进行了工商业调整工作。并根据私营厂商的请求，由国营贸易机构实行向他们加工、订货，同时大量收购农产品和副产品，发展城乡交流，使改组后的私营工商业迅速得到恢复。以上海、天津、北京、武汉、广州、重庆、西安等七大城市为例，一九五○年上半年私营工商业向政府报告开业的计一万二千七百五十二家，报告歇业的则有一万八千八百四十七家，到了下半年，报告开业的计有三万一千五百零九家，报告歇业的只有六千七百三十六家。下半年私营工商业的营业额也比上半年显著增加。一九五一年，在各级人民政府与国营经济加强领导下，公私经济的分工合作更趋密切，私营工商业也得到进一步发展，仍以上述七大城市为例，一九五一年年底私营工商业户数较一九五○年年底增加了百分之二十，其中私营工业增加了百分之三十三，私营商业增加了百分之十五。
    一九五二年，经过“三反”“五反”运动，私营工商业得到进一步的改造与调整，旧社会所遗留的妨害国家前进的污毒已被彻底揭发与大量扫除，全国气象一新。这对于国家经济建设与正当的私营工商业的发展，是极为有利的。今年六月间在北京举行了全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议，私营工商业者已进一步团结与组织起来，并在全国各地普遍开展了共同纲领的学习。这些都将使私营工商业走上健全发展的道路。中央人民政府政务院陈云副总理在此次会议中，对于今后如何计算加工订货的合理利润问题，提出了一个大概轮廓，认为须分别不同情形，按照私营工厂的资本计算，在正常合理的经营下可有百分之十左右、百分之二十左右到百分之三十左右的利润。这个规定，受到私营工商业者的热烈欢迎。
    国营贸易企业对私营厂商的加工、订货，是公私兼顾的良好办法。它不但可以加强生产与市场的计划性，加强国营对私营的领导，同时对私营厂商也可以解决其原料供应与成品推销的困难，并且保证其合理的利润。在私营厂商说来，承接国家的加工订货，无疑是最稳当可靠的经营，与旧社会中冒着风险的盲目性经营比较一下，谁都能得出这样的结论。目前国营企业对私营厂商的加工订货正在扩展，一九五二年三月至六月对上海私营工厂的加工、订货及收购额较一九五一年同期增加了一倍，占上海私营工厂营业总额的百分之八十，关系工厂达七千余家，其他如天津，加工订货额也占私营工厂营业总额的百分之六十，广州有半数以上私营工厂承做国家的加工订货。今后私营工业家只要能适合国家建设的要求，积极改善经营，不再犯“五毒”，他们的发展是有保证的。私营商业方面，人民政府允许在国家统一的经济计划内实行国内贸易的自由（共同纲领第三十七条），并正在鼓励与组织他们积极参加城乡交流与内外交流。目前由国家统购统销的商品只有少数几种，而且统购品仍可拨给私商分销，统销出口品也可委托私商经营，他们的经营范围是很广阔的。
    四、少数民族贸易的发展
    为了促进各少数民族地区与全国各地的物资交流，帮助少数民族人民发展生产，提高他们的生活水平，国营贸易部门根据人民政府的指示，先后在各少数民族地区设立了国营贸易公司的门市部、采购站、加工厂和流动贸易小组等，据不完全统计，三年来计有一千一百多单位，帮助少数民族人民大量推销畜产品和其他土特产，供给他们所需要的生产资料和生活资料，扶助合作社的建立与发展，并团结正当私营商业共同扩大少数民族地区内的商业网。中央人民政府并于一九五一年八月在北京召开了全国民族贸易会议，使各地区的少数民族贸易获得更进一步的发展。
    国营贸易机构首先提高了各区域主要产品如畜产品等的收购价格，改变了过去少数民族地区产品与一般商品交换比价长期的不合理现象。如青海西宁羊毛每百斤与布匹的交换率：解放前为二十五尺，一九五一年十二月已提高至三百○三尺；与茶砖的交换率：解放前为一封半，一九五一年十二月为十四封；与小米的交换率：解放前为三百七十五斤，一九五一年十二月为一千三百一十二斤。西康羊毛交换茶叶：解放前羊毛一百斤换茶三包，解放后换八包多。内蒙古粮食一吨，一九四七年换布半匹，一九五○年换二·二二匹。又如湖南西部苗族区解放前每百斤桐油换食盐一百斤，一九五○年八月换三百斤。贵州大定苗族区解放前每百斤桐油换盐二十三斤，一九五一年换一百六十斤。
    由于收购价格的合理提高和大量收购，刺激了各少数民族区域畜产品及其他特产品的增产，人民收入增加，购买力提高，因而各族人民的生活也得到很大改善。
    我国西北少数民族区域一九五一年畜产品产量较解放前的一九四八年增加了百分之五十。西北区陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海四省羊毛年产量，如以抗日战争前最高的一九三三年为一○○，则今年为一一○。内蒙古自治区解放后到现在牲畜增加了一倍（在过去须十五年到二十年才能增一倍），一九五一年各种牲畜较一九五○年增殖的百分比：黄牛增百分之一五，绵羊增百分之一七，山羊增百分之六五。
    我国西北新疆、青海、宁夏各省牧民购买力一般的比解放前提高了六倍至七倍，在某一流动贸易小组所接触的五千人中，有百分之八十的人民换上了新衣服，解放前在少数民族地区极稀贵的盐和茶，现在已经成为少数民族人民普遍使用的消费品。同时，国营贸易机构供应了大量的必需品。对西北少数民族区域茶的供应量，一九五一年较一九五○年增加了九倍。在西康省一九五一年销茶比一九五○年增加了百分之三百九十四。
    在正确的民族贸易政策和国营贸易的扶助与领导下，少数民族区域的商业网逐渐扩大，当地私营工商业也得到顺利发展。如青海省西宁等八县市私营工商业户数，解放前为一千六百六十二户，一九五一年增加至三千九百四十四户。宁夏定远营，解放前仅有工商业户四十九户，一九五一年八月增至二百九十九户。
    少数民族区域贸易的发展，对于促进各族人民的团结和经济、文化的提高，起了很大作用。
    总括三年来国内贸易情况，由于物价完全稳定，城乡交流广泛开展及公私关系正确调整，已使市场日益繁荣，促进了工农业生产的恢复与发展，为今后长期的经济建设打下很好基础。往后我国生产更加发展，物资交流更加扩大，贸易的任务也更重大，因而一切经营与措施，更必须在国家统一的计划领导下，为经济建设服务。三年来我国各方面的胜利与成就，使全国人民更充满信心在毛主席与中央人民政府领导下来完成光荣的历史任务，也更看到了自己的远大前途。
