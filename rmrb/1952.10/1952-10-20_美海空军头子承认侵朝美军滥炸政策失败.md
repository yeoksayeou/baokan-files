Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Since launching the so-called "sea-air attacks" in June, the invading US military in Korea has carried out nearly four months of indiscriminate bombing and barbaric massacres against peaceful towns and villages and the elderly, weak, women and children in northern Korea. They once attempted to use this bestial "sea-air attack" to replace failed ground attacks and continue to exert so-called "military pressure." However, now even American generals themselves have had to admit that the air force's indiscriminate bombing has also failed.

Recently returned to Washington from Korea, US Marine Corps Commandant Shepherd told reporters on the 13th: "The US Air Force's intensive bombing in the rear of North Korea to destroy the Communist supply lines has failed." He admitted that the US military's continuous bombing day and night "has not been able to stop the enemy's supply transportation." In the face of undeniable facts, Shepherd had to point out that the "brilliant achievements" announced by the US Air Force authorities were exaggerated. He said: "It is very difficult to bomb the roads to make them impassable. It is not as simple as the Air Force said in the Sunday supplements of the newspapers." Furthermore, "the number of trucks destroyed by the Air Force when attacking the Communist rear is too exaggerated," "it is simply impossible to have so many planes to bomb all those trucks, it is simply impossible." In the final analysis, Shepherd said: "I think we should admit that this attack has failed." In view of this situation, Shepherd could not help but feel discouraged about the prospect of expanding the war of aggression. He said that the failure of the US Air Force in Korea "is a very clear lesson we have learned. If you can't do this on those narrow and bad roads in Korea... then how can you do it in Europe?"

Commander Partridge of the US Fifth Air Force, who directed the US Air Force's indiscriminate bombing of Korea, also admitted in a conversation with a reporter from the International News Service on the 14th: "It would be foolish to think that the Allied forces can completely prevent the Communist forces from transporting reserves and supplies to the front." After interviewing Partridge, this International News Service reporter came to the conclusion: "The Communist forces in Korea are fully capable of replenishing supplies and reserves to launch their current limited offensives, and the Fifth Air Force cannot stop them."

Shepherd's and Partridge's remarks once again illustrate the falsity of the so-called "destruction" of "military targets" on the Korean-Chinese side, which has been repeatedly touted in US war reports. The "achievements" of the US Air Force's continuous indiscriminate bombing of northern Korea day and night are nothing but the destruction of peaceful towns and villages in Korea and the massacre of peaceful residents.

### 美海空军头子承认侵朝美军滥炸政策失败

    美海空军头子承认侵朝美军滥炸政策失败
    【新华社十八日讯】侵朝美军自从在六月间发动所谓“海空攻击”以来，对朝鲜北部和平城乡与老弱妇孺进行了将近四个月的狂轰滥炸和野蛮屠杀。他们曾经企图用这种兽性的“海空攻击”来代替失败了的地面攻击，继续实施所谓“军事压力”。但是，现在连美国将军们自己都不得不承认：空军的狂轰滥炸也同样失败了。
    最近从朝鲜回到华盛顿的美国海军陆战队司令谢培德，于十三日对新闻记者说：“美国空军在北朝鲜后方为摧毁共军补给线而进行的猛烈轰炸是失败的”。他承认：美军日夜不断地轰炸，“没有能够制止敌人的给养运输”。在无法掩饰的事实的面前，谢培德不得不指出，美国空军当局发表的“赫赫战果”是夸大之谈。他说：“轰炸公路使它们成为不能通行的路是件很困难的事。并不如报纸星期日增刊上空军所发表的文章里说的那么简单。”此外，“关于空军出袭共军后方时击毁的卡车数目未免太夸大”，“根本不可能有那么多的飞机来轰炸所有那些卡车，这是根本办不到的”。归根到底一句话，谢培德说：“我想应该承认这种出击是失败的。”鉴于这种情况，谢培德不免对扩大侵略战争的前景感到泄气。他说，美国空军在朝鲜的失败，“这是我们得到的一个很明确的教训。如果你在朝鲜那些狭窄恶劣的路上办不到这一点……那么，你如何能在欧洲办到这一点呢？”
    指挥侵朝美国空军滥肆轰炸的美国第五航空队司令巴喀斯，十四日在对国际新闻社记者发表谈话时也承认：“如果以为联军能够完全阻止共军后备人员及供应品运往前方，那是一种愚蠢的想法。”这个国际新闻社记者在访问巴喀斯之后，得出了这样的结论：“在朝鲜的共军完全能够补充供应品和后备人员来发动他们目前的有限攻势，而第五航空队无法加以禁阻。”
    谢培德和巴喀斯的谈话，再度说明了美方战报中
    一再吹嘘的所谓“炸毁”朝中方面“军事目标”的虚假性。美国空军对朝鲜北部日以继夜的狂轰滥炸所造成的“战绩”不是其他，而是朝鲜和平城乡的被破坏与和平居民的被屠杀。
