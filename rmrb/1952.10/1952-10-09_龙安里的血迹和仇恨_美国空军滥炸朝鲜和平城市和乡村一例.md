The bloodstains and Hatred in Long'an-ri
—An Example of the U.S. Air Force's Indiscriminate Bombing of Peaceful Cities and Villages in Korea
Li Rui

It was almost sunset when I left Long'an-ri and returned to the mountain. The bombed Long'an-ri was still smoldering, with black smoke rising. These plumes of smoke spiraled upwards, like several black pillars rising into the high sky, then slowly turning into brownish-gray clouds.

Long'an-ri is located in a very remote mountain valley near the 38th parallel, with forty or fifty peaceful households. In the winter of 1950, when the U.S. and Rhee's invading forces were defeated by the Chinese and Korean people and retreated from here, they gathered all the families of the labor party members, local staff members, and those they considered "suspicious elements." Then, on a dark night, they dragged them into the deep mountains and mowed them down with machine guns. Not even the sixty or seventy-year-old elders or the nursing babies were spared. The other households were also looted, and all the able-bodied men were tied up and taken away with long ropes. Before leaving, they set fire to many homes.

However, the people here did not all die. Some crawled out of the piles of corpses, and some returned to their homes from the deep mountains. They gritted their teeth and began to rebuild their fields and live again. They cut down some trees from the mountains and gathered some weeds, and built simple houses on the ruins. Women carried their children on their backs, barefoot, and took the place of their husbands and children, again taking up the plow. The elderly carried wooden frames on their backs, laboriously carrying manure to the barren fields to plant crops. They raised the orphans who had no parents. For more than a year, because the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers were holding back the enemy, the people here gradually caught their breath. Their fields were once again filled with crops swaying in the wind, gourds and pumpkins climbed all over the roofs, children began to dance and sing barefoot under the trees, and there were again sounds of reading in the schools...

This spring, American planes scattered many leaflets in this area, saying that the people here were suffering too much, and they would drop cod liver oil and biscuits from the sky to help them. Soon, many things were indeed dropped, but not biscuits and cod liver oil, but dead fish, dead rats, and flies and mosquitoes. When the Volunteers learned of this, they sent people to help them eliminate the bacteria and carry out disease prevention treatment, averting a disaster.

When the spring plowing season arrived, American night bombers took advantage of the quiet of night when people were asleep and dropped many time bombs, and several people were injured while plowing the fields. When the Volunteers heard about this, they sent people to dig for several days, clearing the bombs from the fields and helping everyone complete the spring plowing.

In the spring, when the old grain was running out and the new grain was not yet ripe, mothers carried their children barefoot up the mountains to dig for wild vegetables, and the children cried out in hunger. The Volunteers, with their keen ears, saved two ounces of rice each, and the soldiers personally carried it to the homes of the villagers. In this way, the villagers survived the spring famine.

In the summer, there was a shortage of rain, and rice paddies could not be planted. Later, when it rained, it was necessary to rush the planting in three or two days, but there were too few people, and it looked like it would not be possible to plant. When the Volunteers learned of this, cadres and soldiers came in a group, rolled up their trouser legs and went into the water together, and soon planted the rice seedlings neatly. ...

The village and fields were full of life. The yellow millet hung heavily with ears, the rice had already turned yellow, the corn cobs were as big as ox horns, and the kenaf bloomed with bright red flowers. The Volunteers, fearing that someone might accidentally step on a crop, put up many small wooden stakes along the roads in each village, with ropes tied to the stakes and signs reading "Do Not Trample the Seedlings." In this way, even every little seedling along the road grew neatly. Gourds and pumpkins climbed all over the roofs of every house, and pears and apples bent the branches on the mountains behind each house. The harvest season was just around the corner. The women began to carry baskets of yellow soil from far away to level the small threshing grounds in front of their doors, and the old people sat under the eaves mending straw bags to hold the grain. They worked hard and happily, preparing to welcome the coming harvest.

The small village was revived.

However, new disasters followed closely behind.

Since Harrison openly walked away from the Panmunjom talks and their "military pressure" continued to be shattered everywhere, large groups of American planes have been constantly flying over this area, constantly dropping large quantities of propaganda. These propaganda materials said: They were going to bomb seventy-eight towns in North Korea, which were "military targets that had been investigated for a long time," but would never bomb ordinary villages or civilians. They wanted the people "not to panic." They were truly "benevolent," as if they were concerned about not scaring the people here.

However, on the morning of August 8th, while the farmers were eating breakfast, a group of American planes suddenly attacked this small village. Although there were no bridges, no warehouses, no troops stationed, no railways or highways, and it was not even close to an ordinary town, no one would consider this a "military target." But the American pilots launched a fierce strafing and bombing attack on these thatched huts and unarmed old, weak, women and children. Rocket shells, bombs, and napalm bombs fell like hail on the thatched roofs covered with gourds and pumpkins. In an instant, flesh and blood flew, and the small village became a sea of fire. A young Korean girl named Shin Eun-nyeo was drawing water by the river, and just as she raised the water jar above her head, one of her arms was blown off, and the fresh blood stained the river red. An old Korean woman, Kim Da-niang, was feeding her grandson when a bomb that flew in through the doors and windows blew off her head just as she brought the small copper spoon to her little grandson's mouth. The trees and houses inside and outside the village caught fire at the same time, and the rice paddies immediately turned into terrible bomb craters. In just a few minutes, more than thirty people in this small village lay bloodied and blurred in the smoke and fire. And they, just a few minutes before, were still working hard, still laughing and singing, still hoping for tomorrow, just like each of us.

I don't want to record here in detail the tragic scene of the bombing of this village: the houses have been burned, the people have been bombed to death, but the rose of Sharon flowers outside the door are still blooming. The mother was lying in a pool of blood, already dead, and the child wrapped on her back was still crying loudly for her mother; the breakfast on the table was still steaming, but the people around the low table had already closed their eyes; the sorghum and corn had all been destroyed, and the wooden sign "Do Not Trample the Seedlings" was still firmly tied to the rope...

But the Korean people of Long'an-ri did not all die, nor did they succumb. And they ignited an even wider and more universal fire of hatred.

On this morning, the "Defend Kaesong Steel Eighth Company" of a certain unit of the Volunteers was digging fortifications on the hilltop, and they saw enemy planes bombing the nearby villages from afar, and the soldiers' hearts felt as if they were on fire. They threw down their picks, grabbed their first-aid kits, and rushed down the mountain, running towards the raging fire in Long'an-ri.

Enemy planes were still circling overhead. Another group was still dropping bombs over other villages nearby. The houses and trees in the village were on fire, and the flames were already scorching from a distance. However, the warriors of the Eighth Company did not hesitate for even a moment, just like jumping out of the trenches to kill the enemy when they heard the charge horn on the front line. Led by Deputy Company Commander Tian Junxiu and Deputy Instructor Tian Zhongxin, they rushed into the smoke-filled village.

Liu Yadong, a soldier of the Third Platoon, rushed into a burning house and carried out a wounded old woman. Just as he put the old woman on his back, before he could rush out of the house, his own body caught fire. The thick smoke blocked the door, choking him almost unconscious. But he thought that if he put out the fire on his own body first, the old woman would probably be beyond saving. So he gritted his teeth and endured the unbearable pain, and carried the old woman to a safe place under a tree on the hillside before putting out the fire on his own body.

Li Changhua, a twenty-year-old young soldier, heard the sound of a child crying in a house. He rushed into the house and saw that an old woman who was feeding a child was killed by the bombing, and the child's hair was already on fire. He put out the fire on the child's head and held the child tightly in his arms. When the flames rushed over, he used his body to protect the child, letting the fire burn him. After coming out, he didn't stop for even a minute, and rushed back into the sea of fire, and a few minutes later, he carried out a seven-year-old boy.

Luo Qinglian, a soldier of the Seventh Squad, braved the smoke and fire to carry grain out for the villagers. When he was carrying the fifth bag, he could no longer support himself, but he thought, "If the people are rescued but there is no grain, how will they live?" So he mustered his last strength and finally carried out the last bag of grain, but as soon as he put the grain down, he fainted.

Dear readers! Let me pay tribute here to those respectable soldiers! Teng Yunting, Xu Xuekuan, Zhou Shucai, Wu Yuangeng, Liu Guocheng... and all the soldiers of the Second and Third Platoons, when they had rescued all the people they could rescue and rescued all the things they could rescue, they themselves were burned so badly that they had lost their hair and eyebrows, and it was almost impossible to tell each other's original faces.

Before they even washed their faces, they sat down together and started a meeting. They said angrily, "The American devils are frantically slaughtering the Korean people, and we must work hard to save the Korean people." They immediately made a decision to save two ounces of rice per person per meal to help the disaster victims who had no food. The wounded villagers were sent to the logistics medical station. Liu Guocheng, a young soldier, took out the health care medicine he had just received yesterday. He said, "Health care medicine is a piece of loving heart from the people of the motherland, and we should transfer this piece of loving heart to the injured people of Korea."

The soldiers of the First Platoon, because they were too far away from here, did not have time to rush to put out the fire, and arrived after crossing the mountains in the afternoon. Regardless of their fatigue from digging fortifications for a day, they immediately took off their clothes and wielded their picks to dig holes for the disaster-stricken villagers.

Clark, Van Fleet, and Weyland and their ilk are attempting to use the massive bloodshed of innocent civilians to intimidate the Chinese and Korean people. They dream of using these crazy and barbaric slaughter methods to force the negotiators of the Chinese and Korean people to yield and compromise. However, their calculations are completely wrong. Their shameless slaughter cannot frighten the Chinese and Korean people. Let them hear the voices of the ordinary people of Long'an-ri!

Cao Bingxun, an old man in his sixties, was so angry that his beard stood on end. He said sadly at the mass meeting of the whole village: "Today is August 8th, and everyone in Long'an-ri will not forget it. Let each of us write this day on our clothes, and for thousands of generations, we will avenge this blood feud!"

Hong Chunji, a labor party member, held her bombed-to-death baby without shedding a tear, standing in the crowd like a stone person. Finally, she shouted like an explosion: "The enemy's such frenzied slaughter is trying to make us bend our knees. But we want to answer the enemy that the knees of us Koreans are made of steel and iron, and we will never yield to any enemy. In the future, we will do the work of two people alone, and we will work one day as two days. Millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of people around the world sympathize with us and support us. This blood will not be shed in vain. One day, these murderers will stand before us to be judged." She went alone to dig a small pit behind the mountain to bury the dead child, and that night she mobilized a group of women to carry iron shovels to repair the road.

On the same afternoon, many Korean women, old people and children living nearby carried baskets full of pears and melons, climbed over the mountains and ridges, and comforted the volunteer soldiers who were putting out the fire. Meetings were held in each neighborhood and village, and there was a roar of anger everywhere.

On the same afternoon, an old man climbed several small mountains to go to the command post of the Steel Eighth Company to report his son - a special agent of the American army who had parachuted into the nearby deep mountains. He said: "I wanted to report him earlier, but I couldn't break the father-son relationship, but now, I can't help but report him."

In this way, hatred burned like a flame. "Avenge!"
"Let's avenge!" "Vengeance will always be avenged," stringing people's hearts together, everywhere, it was this one voice.

It was almost sunset when I left Long'an-ri and returned to the mountain. The ruins of Long'an-ri were still smoldering with black smoke. These plumes of smoke spiraled upwards, rising into the sky, then turning into brownish-gray clouds. I stood angrily on the top of the mountain and looked for a long time. Looking at my watch, the time was six o'clock in the afternoon. In countries without war, in peaceful cities and villages, it is the time when elementary school students are carrying their schoolbags, returning home after school and running to their mothers, right? It is the time when people who have worked for a day are walking to the streets or the edge of the village for a walk, right? Even the thirty or so dead people in Long'an-ri, at this moment yesterday, were still repairing the agricultural tools for threshing, preparing for the upcoming autumn harvest, and the children were still wearing small boat shoes, dancing and singing under the green shade, and the green crops and the gourds and pumpkins all over the roof were still swaying in the wind...

Long'an-ri is just one of the thousands of peaceful Korean villages that have been indiscriminately bombed. At this moment when I am writing, in the skies over countless peaceful villages in Korea, I have already seen such plumes of smoke countless times. If we don't want to sit and wait for these fresh blood to flow to our feet, and don't want to sit and wait for such plumes of smoke to rise from our roofs, then let us take action immediately and put all our strength into the sacred cause of defending peace! Any hesitation or reluctance to move forward is a crime against humanity and against ourselves.

    龙安里的血迹和仇恨
    ——美国空军滥炸朝鲜和平城市和乡村一例
    李蕤
    我离开龙安里回到山上的时候，太阳已经快落了。被轰炸的龙安里，余火未熄，还在冒着黑烟。这些烟，一团一团向上盘旋着，好像几条黑色的柱子，一直升入高高的天空，然后慢慢变成灰褐色的云块。
    龙安里座落在三八线附近一个十分偏僻的山沟里，有四五十户和平居民。一九五○年冬季，美李侵略军被中朝人民打败，从这里溃退的时候，把全村劳动党员的家属、地方工作人员的家属和他们认为“嫌疑分子”的家属，统通集中到一起。然后在一个黑漆漆的夜晚，拉到深山里，用机关枪扫射。连六七十岁的老人、正吃奶的婴儿，也一个不留。其他的住户，也抢掠一空，青壮男子一个人一条长绳，绑起来全部拉走。临走还放一把火，把许多人家的房子烧掉。
    但是，这里的老百姓，并没有完全死掉。有些人从死尸堆里又爬出来，有些从深山里又回到自己的家。他们咬了咬牙，又开始整理田园，生活下来。他们从山上砍下些树木，割来些杂草，在废墟上又架起简单的家屋。妇女们背上背着孩子，赤着脚，代替自己的丈夫和孩子，又扶起犁杖。老年人背上背着木架，艰难地把粪土送到荒芜的田地里，种上庄稼。他们把无父无母的孤儿，又抚养起来。一年多的时间，因为有朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在前面挡着敌人，这里的人民又渐渐喘过一口气来。他们的地里，又生满迎风摇摆的庄稼，屋顶上又爬满葫芦和南瓜，孩子们又开始光着脚在树下跳舞唱歌，学校里又有了读书的声音……。
    今年春天，美国的飞机在这一带散了许多传单，说这里的老百姓太苦了，他们要从天上往下投鱼肝油和饼干来救济。不久，果然投下许多东西来，但不是饼干和鱼肝油，而是死鱼、死老鼠和苍蝇、蚊子。志愿军知道了，派人来帮助他们扑灭了细菌、进行了预防疾病的治疗，免除了一场灾难。
    春耕的季节到了，美国的夜航机趁着夜静人们都睡熟的时候，掷下了许多定时炸弹，到地里去犁地的人，伤了好几口子。志愿军听到了，就派人来挖了几天，把地里的炸弹扫净，帮助大家完成了春耕。
    春天，青黄不接，母亲背着孩子光着脚上山挖野菜，孩子们饿得直哭叫。志愿军的耳朵是灵的，就每人节约二两米，战士们亲自背着，送进老乡家里。这样，村里的人，就又度过了春荒。
    入夏，雨水很缺，稻田不能插秧，后来下了场雨，需要三两天就抢种完，但人手太少，眼看是种不上。志愿军知道了，干部战士来了一群，卷起裤脚
    一齐下水，很快便把稻秧插得整整齐齐。……
    村庄里田野里，充满着生机。黄谷沉甸甸地垂着穗子，稻子已经泛出黄色，包谷穗大的和牛角一样，洋麻开着鲜红的花。志愿军为了怕谁不小心踩坏一棵庄稼，在各村路边插了许多小木桩子，小木桩子上系着绳子，绳子上挂着“勿踏青苗”的牌子，这样，连路边的每一棵小苗苗，都长得整整齐齐。每家的屋顶上，都爬满葫芦和南瓜，每家屋子后面的山上，梨子、苹果压弯了树枝。眼看秋收的季节就要到了。妇女们，开始一筐筐从很远的地方顶来黄土，垫平门前的小打禾场，老人们坐在屋檐下修补准备盛粮食的草袋，他们辛苦地愉快地劳动着，准备迎接就要来的丰收。
    小村庄复活了。
    但是，新的灾难紧跟在后面。
    自从哈利逊在板门店会场公开逃会，他们的“军事压力”又到处碰得头破血流以后，这一带的上空，便不断飞过大群的美国飞机，并不断散发下大批的宣传品。这些宣传品上说：他们要轰炸北朝鲜七十八个城镇，这些城镇是“经过他们长时间调查的军事目标”，但决不轰炸普通的乡村，也不轰炸平民。要老百姓“不要惊慌”。他们真是“仁慈”，好像还顾虑到不要惊吓了这里的老百姓。
    但是，八月八日的上午，农民们正吃早饭的时候，一群美国飞机，突然侵袭了这个小小的村庄。虽然这里一无桥梁，二无仓库，三无驻军，四无铁路公路，连普通城镇也不沾边，谁也不会认为这是“军事目标”。可是美国驾驶员对着这些茅屋和手无寸铁的老弱妇孺展开了猛烈的扫射和轰炸，火箭炮、炸弹、凝固汽油弹，像冰雹似的落在这些爬满葫芦南瓜的茅屋顶上。一时血肉横飞，小小村庄成了一片火海。一个年青的朝鲜姑娘，叫做申银女的，正在河边汲水，刚刚把水罐子举到头顶，一只胳膊就炸飞了，鲜血染红了河水。一个朝鲜老妈妈金大娘，正在喂孙孙吃饭，刚刚把小铜匙子送到小孙孙的嘴边，就被飞进门窗的炸弹，炸掉了她的脑袋。村内村外的树木房屋，一齐起火，稻田立时变成可怕的弹坑，这样一个小小的村庄，几分钟的时间，便有三十多个人血肉模糊地躺倒在烟火堆里。而他们，在几分钟前，还在辛辛苦苦工作着，还在欢笑和歌唱，还在希望着明天，如同我们每一个人一样。
    我不想在这里多记载这村庄被轰炸的惨景：房子已经烧了，人都炸死了，门外的木槿花，却还在开着花。母亲躺在血泊里，已经断了气，缠在她背上的孩子，还在呱呱地哭叫着妈妈；桌子上的早饭还在冒着热气，矮桌四围的人却已经闭起了眼睛；高粱包谷都被毁了，“勿踏青苗”的木牌还在绳子上牢牢系着……。
    但是龙安里的朝鲜人民，并没有死绝，也没有屈服。而且燃起了更广大更普遍的仇恨的烈火。
    这一天的早晨，志愿军某部的“保卫开城钢铁八连”正在山头上挖工事，远远看到了敌机轰炸附近的乡村，战士们的心，好像火烧着一样的难受。他们扔下铁镐，带着救急包，就飞奔下山，跑向大火熊熊的龙安里。
    敌机还在上空盘旋。另外一批，还在附近别的村庄上空投弹。村子的房屋和树木都起了火，很远处火焰便有些扑人。但是，八连的勇士们，谁也没有稍稍迟疑一下，就像在前线听到冲锋号跳出阵地杀敌一样，在副连长田俊修、副指导员田忠信的领导下，冲进烟火弥漫的村子里。
    三排战士刘亚东，冲进一间正在燃烧着的房子，背出一个受伤的老太太，刚刚把老太太背在背上，他还没有冲出屋子，自己的身上便着了火，浓烟封住了门，呛得他几乎晕倒。但是他想如果先扑灭自己身上的火，老太太恐怕便没救了。于是他咬紧牙齿，忍受着难以忍受的疼痛，一直把那老太太背到山坡树下的安全地带，才扑灭自己身上的火。
    二十岁的青年战士李长华，听到一个屋子里有小孩子的哭声，他冲进屋子一看，一个正喂孩子吃饭的老太太被炸死了，孩子的头发已经着火。他扑灭了孩子头上的火，把孩子紧紧搂在怀里，火焰一扑过来，他就用身子护住孩子，让火烧着自己。出来以后，连一分钟也没有停，一反身冲进火海，几分钟后，抱出一个七岁的男孩。
    七班的战士罗庆连，来来往往冒着烟火替老乡往外抢粮食。扛到第五包的时候，他自己已经完全不能支持了，但是他想：“救出人来没有粮食，他们怎样活下去呢？”就拚出最后的气力，终于把最后一包粮食也抢出来，但刚刚把粮食放下，他自己就晕倒了。
    亲爱的读者们！让我在这里向那些可敬的战士们致敬吧！滕云亭、许学宽、周树才、吴远耕、刘国成……和二排三排的全体战士们，当他们把能救的人都救出来，能抢的东西都抢出来的时候，自己也被烧得少了头发没有眉毛，几乎分辨不出各人的原来面目了。
    他们连脸都没洗，就又坐在一起开起会来。他们愤怒地说：“美国鬼子疯狂屠杀朝鲜人民，我们要努力救活朝鲜人民。”他们立刻作出决定，每人每餐节约二两米，救济没有饭吃的灾民。受伤的老乡，被送到后勤医疗所。年青的战士刘国成，把昨天才领到的保健药品拿出来。他说：“保健药是祖国人民爱我们的一片心意，我们应该把这一份心意转送给朝鲜受伤的人民。”
    一排的战士们，因为离这里太远，没有来得及赶来救火，下午翻山越岭地赶来了。他们不顾自己一天挖工事的疲劳，立刻脱下衣服，抡起铁镐，替被灾的老乡们挖起洞子来。
    克拉克、范佛里特、威兰之流，是企图以无辜平民的大量鲜血，吓倒中朝人民的。他们梦想着用他们这些疯狂野蛮的屠杀手段，迫使中朝人民的谈判代表屈服让步。可是，他们的算盘完全打错了。他们无耻的屠杀，吓不倒中朝人民。让他们听听龙安里普通人民的声音吧！
    六十多岁的老头子曹秉勋，愤怒得胡子都竖起来了。他沉痛地在全村的群众大会上说：“今天是八月八日，龙安里每一个人都不会忘记。我们每一个人都把这一天写在衣襟上吧，千年万代，我们也要报这个血仇！”
    劳动党员洪春姬，抱着被炸死的婴儿一滴泪也没有流，像石头人一样在人群里站着。最后，她像爆炸似地高喊道：“敌人这样的疯狂屠杀，是想要我们软下膝盖。可是，我们要回答敌人，我们朝鲜人的膝盖是钢是铁，我们永远也不会向任何敌人屈服的。我们今后，一个人要作两个人的事，一天要当做两天来工作。全世界几百万几千万几万万人都同情着我们，支持着我们。这些血不会白流。总有一天，这些杀人犯会站在我们面前受审判的。”她独自到山后掘个小坑，埋了死掉的孩子，当夜就又动员了一群妇女，背着铁锨去修路去了。
    当天下午，就有许多在附近居住的朝鲜妇女，老人和儿童，顶着满筐子的梨子、甜瓜，爬山越岭，慰劳救火的志愿军战士。各里各村都在开会，到处是一片怒吼的声音。
    当天下午，就有一个老头子，爬了几条小山，到钢铁八连的指挥所去检举他的儿子——美军空降到附近深山里的特务。他说：“我早想检举他，可总割不断父子之情，现在，我再不能不检举他了。”
    就这样，仇恨像火焰一样燃烧起来。“报仇呵！”
    “报仇吧！”“仇总要报的”，把人们的心全穿起来了，各处各处，都是这一个声音。
    离开龙安里回到山上的时候，太阳已经快落山了。龙安里的废墟上，还在冒着黑色的烟。这些烟，一团团向上盘旋着，升入空际，然后变成灰褐色的云块。我愤怒地站在山头上，望了很久。看看表，时间是下午六点钟。在没有战争的国度里，在和平城市和乡村里，正是小学生背着书包，放学归来跑向妈妈的时候吧？正是劳动一天的人，走向街头或村梢散步的时候吧？就是龙安里的三十多个死者，昨天的此刻，也还在修理打禾的农具，准备就要来到的秋收，小孩子也还穿着小小的船鞋，在绿荫下跳舞唱歌，青青绿绿的庄稼，满屋顶的葫芦南瓜，也还在迎风乱摆……。
    龙安里，这不过是千百个被滥炸的朝鲜和平乡村中的一个。我执笔的此刻，在朝鲜许许多多和平的村庄上空，已经又无数次地看见这样的烟柱。如果我们不想坐待着这些鲜血流到我们的脚边，不想坐待着让我们的屋顶也升起这样的烟柱，那么，我们立刻行动起来，拿出所有的力量投入保卫和平的神圣事业吧！任何犹豫或踟蹰不前，都是对人类和对自己的犯罪。
