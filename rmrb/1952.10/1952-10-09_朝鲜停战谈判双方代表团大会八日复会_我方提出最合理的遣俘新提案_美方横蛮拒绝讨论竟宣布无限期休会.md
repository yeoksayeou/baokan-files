Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 8th. The Korean armistice talks resumed between the delegations of both sides. Our chief delegate, General Nam Il, pointed out: The plan proposed by the other side on September 28th, in essence, still insisted on the other side's unreasonable demand for forcibly detaining prisoners of war, fundamentally violated the Geneva Convention and the principle of complete repatriation of all prisoners of war by both sides already agreed upon in the draft armistice agreement. Therefore, it is unacceptable. However, our side still solemnly considered the formal changes to the other side's plan based on the principle of complete repatriation of prisoners of war, adopted the other side's opinion of sending all prisoners of war to the demilitarized zone for exchange, and proposed the most reasonable specific method for prisoner repatriation that fully complied with the Geneva Convention and the draft armistice agreement. However, the other side's chief delegate, Harrison, rudely announced a recess until our side was willing to accept the other side's plan by presenting an aide-mémoire, and left the meeting place without waiting for our representative to speak. The other side's rude and unreasonable attitude fully demonstrates that the U.S. side has no sincerity in reaching a Korean armistice. The responsibility for the continuation of the Korean War, the delay and even breakdown of the armistice talks lies entirely with the U.S. side. The full text of General Nam Il's speech at the meeting on the 8th is as follows:

    After careful study of the three proposals on the repatriation of prisoners of war put forward by your side on September 28th, our side believes that they still run through your side's unreasonable demand for forcibly detaining prisoners of war in essence, and by no means implement the complete repatriation of prisoners of war in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention and the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both sides. Therefore, they cannot be accepted. The purpose of your proposal is to attempt to cover up the essence of your insistence on so-called voluntary repatriation with some minor formal changes, to deceive the people of the world who long for a Korean armistice, and to evade your responsibility for delaying the negotiations. But your calculation is in vain, because in each of your proposals you mention so-called prisoners of war who oppose repatriation, that is, prisoners of war who are forcibly detained by your side through the activities and control of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek's agents. This act of forcibly detaining prisoners of war is a blatant violation of the provisions of the Geneva Convention and is resolutely opposed by all righteous people in the world. Furthermore, this unreasonable demand is the only crux hindering the final agreement on a Korean armistice. If your side does not abolish this unreasonable demand, your side will never escape the responsibility of delaying the negotiations. In order to deceive the people of the world, your side put forward this plan for detaining prisoners of war, which has not changed in essence. However, on the other hand, your side disregarded our serious warnings and unilaterally handled our captured personnel under your custody, that is, our personnel for whom your side should be absolutely responsible. Your side's illegal actions show that even you yourselves are not prepared to solve the prisoner of war issue with your plan.

    However, we are willing to seriously consider the formal changes in your proposal based on the principle of complete repatriation of prisoners of war by both sides. We believe that all prisoners of war on both sides can be sent to the exchange locations agreed upon by both sides in the demilitarized zone after the armistice agreement takes effect, and then handed over to the other side for acceptance. Then, after visits by joint subgroups of the Red Cross Societies of both sides, it should be guaranteed that these prisoners of war can return home to live peaceful lives and no longer participate in the Korean War. Then, classification should be carried out according to the principles of classification by nationality and region proposed by our side on July 18th. All captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the United Nations Forces must be completely repatriated home; captured personnel of the Korean People's Army whose homes are in North Korea must be completely repatriated home, and those whose homes are in South Korea can return to South Korea; captured personnel of the South Korean Army whose homes are in South Korea must be completely repatriated home, and those whose homes are in North Korea can return to North Korea. The work of this visit, classification and repatriation can be carried out under the observation of neutral nations inspection teams. Our above-mentioned proposal complies with the provisions of the Geneva Convention and the draft armistice agreement, and adopts your side's opinion of sending all prisoners of war to the demilitarized zone for exchange. It is the most reasonable method for solving the only unresolved issue of prisoner repatriation in the Korean armistice agreement. Your side should agree to this proposal without delay in order to satisfy the peaceful wishes of the people of the world, including the American people, to quickly end the Korean War.

    朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会八日复会
    我方提出最合理的遣俘新提案
    美方横蛮拒绝讨论竟宣布无限期休会
    【新华社开城八日电】朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会复会。我方首席代表南日将军指出：对方在九月二十八日所提出的方案，实质上仍然是坚持对方强迫扣留战俘的无理要求，根本违反了日内瓦公约和双方已经协议的停战协定草案条文的全部遣返双方战俘的原则，因此是不能接受的。但我方仍然根据全部遣返战俘的原则郑重地考虑了对方方案的形式变动，采用了对方关于将全部战俘送至非军事区实行交换的意见，提出了完全符合于日内瓦公约和停战协定草案条文的最合理的具体遣俘办法。但对方首席代表哈利逊竟横蛮地以提出哀的美顿书的方式，宣布休会到我方愿意接受对方方案的时间，并不等我方代表发言迳自走离会场。对方这种横蛮无理的态度充分显示了美方根本没有达成朝鲜停战的诚意，朝鲜战争的继续，停战谈判的拖延乃至破裂，其责任完全在于美方。南日将军在八日大会上的发言全文如下：
    你方在九月二十八日提出的关于遣返战俘的三个方案，我方经过慎重研究后，认为它们在实质上仍然是贯穿着你方强迫扣留战俘的无理要求，决非按照日内瓦公约原则及双方已经商定的停战协定草案条文对战俘实行全部遣返。因此，它们是不能被接受的。你方提案的目的是企图以形式上若干微小的变动，来掩盖你方坚持所谓自愿遣返的实质，以欺骗全世界渴望朝鲜停战的人民，并借此逃避你方拖延谈判的责任。但你们这种打算是徒然的，因为你方在每一提案中都提到所谓反对遣返的战俘，那就是你方经过李承晚、蒋介石特务的活动和控制实行强迫扣留的战俘，这种强迫扣留战俘的行为是公然违反日内瓦公约的规定，而为全世界正义人类所坚决反对的。并且这无理要求正是阻碍朝鲜停战达成最后协议的唯一症结所在，你方若不取消这一无理要求，你方永远逃避不脱拖延谈判的责任。你方为了欺骗世界人民，提出了这个实质上丝毫未变的扣留战俘的方案，但另一方面你方竟不顾我方的严重警告，擅自片面处理在你方收容下的，亦即你方应绝对向我方负责的我方被俘人员。你方这种非法行动，说明连你们自己也不准备以你方方案解决遣俘问题。
    不过在你方提案的形式变动方面，我们却愿根据全部遣返双方战俘的原则予以郑重考虑。我们认为双方全部战俘在停战协定生效后，可一律送至非军事区内双方协议的交换地点交给对方接收，然后经过双方红十字会联合小组的访问，保证这些战俘回家过和平生活，不再参加朝鲜战争，然后根据我方七月十八日所提的按照国籍、地区的分类原则进行分类，凡中国人民志愿军与联合国军的被俘人员，必须全部遣返回家；朝鲜人民军被俘人员其家在北朝鲜者必须全部遣返回家，其家在南朝鲜者可以返回南朝鲜；南朝鲜军被俘人员其家在南朝鲜者必须全部遣返回家，其家在北朝鲜者可以返回北朝鲜。此项访问、分类和遣返的工作，可在中立国视察小组观察之下进行。我们上述的这一提案，既符合于日内瓦公约和停战协定草案的规定，又采用了你方关于将全部战俘送至非军事区实行交换的意见，实为解决朝鲜停战协定唯一未决的战俘遣返问题的最合理的办法，你方应毫不迟延地同意这一提案，以满足世界人民包括美国人民在内的迅速结束朝鲜战争的和平愿望。
