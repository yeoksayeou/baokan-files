    On the rostrum of the celebration rally in the Zhongshan Park Music Hall were hung the national flags of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and huge portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, and General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people. Rows of colorful flags around the venue fluttered in the wind.
    Among those attending the celebration rally were Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea; Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea; Zhang Xiruo, Shao Lizi, Peng Zemin, Xu Deheng, and Xu Baoju, Standing Committee Members of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea; Dong Luan, Vice Chairman of the North China General Branch of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea; Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Cao Mengjun, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation; Qian Sanqiang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation; Tian Demin, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation; Fu Huating, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce; Sha Kefu, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and more than 5,000 representatives from all walks of life in the capital.

    Kwon O-jik, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, and many members of the embassy, were also invited to attend the rally.
    The celebration rally began with the band playing "March of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army." Zhang Xiruo, Standing Committee Member of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea and Chairman of the Beijing Branch, delivered the opening address (the full text will be published separately, see page 2). On behalf of the people of the capital and the people of the whole country, he paid high tribute to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and extended warm congratulations on their great victory.
    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, spoke. He said: Today, as we commemorate the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war, we must first express our highest respect to the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—and our highest respect to the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army. Their great victory on the Korean front shattered the plan of the American aggressors to invade Korea and further launch a world war, guaranteed peace in Asia and the world, and strengthened the belief of people all over the world that peace will surely triumph. Guo Moruo then reported on the great achievements of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference recently held in Beijing. He attributed the successful holding and complete success of this conference to the victorious struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, because the victory of their struggle encouraged the courage of the people of Asia and the world to defend peace and created conditions for the success of this conference. Guo Moruo pointed out: Although the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has successfully concluded, we must work even harder to resolutely implement the eleven declarations and resolutions of the conference, especially to continue to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, so that the Korean War can be ended at an early date.
    After Guo Moruo concluded his speech amidst warm applause, he and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, presented a flag to Gan Siqi, Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, on behalf of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea. Subsequently, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles presented flowers to the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and Kwon O-jik, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China. The audience burst into thunderous applause.
    Gan Siqi, head of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army National Day observation delegation and director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, spoke amidst stormy applause. He first extended his cordial and high respect to the people of the motherland on behalf of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He said: "In the past two years, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has achieved a great victory in the war to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country! Together with the heroic Korean People's Army, we have driven the invading forces headed by U.S. imperialism from the Yalu River to the 38th parallel, shattered the heinous conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to occupy the entire Korean Peninsula and attack our country, guaranteed the independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and defended the security of our motherland. In the war, we have become stronger, while the enemy has become smaller!" He then explained that the achievement of this great victory was mainly due to the support of the people of the whole country and the Korean people, and the support of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world. Finally, he pointed out: "The Korean War is still going on. U.S. imperialism is still unreasonably obstructing and undermining the Korean armistice negotiations, and insisting on its so-called 'voluntary repatriation,' which is actually the shameless demand to detain our captured personnel. Recently, the U.S. negotiating representative even announced an indefinite adjournment, suspending the armistice negotiations; at the same time, the U.S. invading forces continue to play the so-called 'military pressure.' Of course, we will not be intimidated by any threats from the U.S. aggressors. We will resolutely and continuously give the enemy heavier blows. We are determined to win the early, fair and reasonable settlement of the Korean issue through the victory of the struggle." Gan Siqi's speech was constantly interrupted by applause that resounded throughout the venue. Every word spoken by the representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the "most beloved people" of the people of the whole country, deeply touched the hearts of all the attendees.
    Kwon O-jik, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, was invited to speak (the full text will be published separately, see page 2). He paid tribute to the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on behalf of the Korean people. His speech constantly won warm applause from all the attendees.
    Young Pioneers stepped onto the rostrum amidst music, presented flowers to Gan Siqi, the representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and Kwon O-jik, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, on behalf of the people of the capital. For a time, applause resounded throughout the venue.
    Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Cao Mengjun, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Qian Sanqiang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, Tian Demin, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, Fu Huating, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Sha Kefu, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and others, respectively, represented the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and various democratic parties, the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles to read out congratulatory telegrams to General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and all commanders and fighters, and to General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army.

    中国人民抗美援朝总会主席郭沫若讲话。他说：今天我们纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战两周年，我们首先要对中国人民最优秀的儿女——中国人民志愿军表示崇高的敬意，对英勇的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军表示崇高的敬意。他们在朝鲜前线的伟大胜利，粉碎了美国侵略者侵略朝鲜并进一步发动世界大战的计划，保障了亚洲和世界和平，使全世界人民增强了和平一定能够胜利的信念。接着郭沫若报告了最近在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议所获得的伟大成就。他把这个会议的胜利举行和圆满成功，归功于中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的胜利斗争，因为他们的斗争的胜利，鼓舞了亚洲和全世界人民保卫和平的勇气，为这次会议的成功创造了条件。郭沫若指出：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议虽然胜利地结束了，但我们还须加倍努力地工作，坚决地实现会议的十一项宣言和决议，特别是要继续支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，使朝鲜战争早日结束。
    郭沫若在热烈的掌声中结束了他的讲话之后，即与中国人民抗美援朝总会副主席陈叔通一起代表抗美援朝总会向中国人民志愿军代表政治部主任甘泗淇等献旗。接着，中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会、中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会、中华全国文学艺术界联合会等人民团体向中国人民志愿军代表和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻我国大使权五稷献花。全场掌声雷动。
    中国人民志愿军国庆节观礼代表团团长、中国人民志愿军政治部主任甘泗淇在暴风雨般的掌声中讲话，他首先代表中国人民志愿军向祖国人民致以亲切的崇高的敬意。他说：“两年来，中国人民志愿军在抗美援朝保家卫国的战争中，已经获得了伟大的胜利！我们和英勇的朝鲜人民军在一起，已把以美帝国主义为首的侵略军队，从鸭绿江边赶回到三八线，粉碎了美帝国主义侵占全部朝鲜、进攻我国的罪恶阴谋，保障了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立，保卫了祖国的安全。在战争中我们已经更为强大，而敌人则更为渺小了！”接着他说明这一伟大胜利的获得，主要是全国人民及朝鲜人民的支持，和以苏联为首的和平民主阵营及全世界爱好和平的人民的声援。最后他指出：“现在朝鲜战争仍在继续进行。美帝国主义仍在无理地阻挠和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，坚持其所谓‘自愿遣返’而实际上是扣留我方被俘人员的无耻要求。最近美方谈判代表竟宣布无限期休会，中止了停战谈判；同时美国侵略军又继续玩弄所谓‘军事压力’。我们当然不会为美国侵略者的任何威胁所吓倒。我们将坚决地、继续地给敌人以更加沉重的打击。我们决以斗争的胜利来争取朝鲜问题早日得到公平合理的解决。”甘泗淇的讲话，不时地为震彻会场的掌声所打断。这位全国人民“最可爱的人”——中国人民志愿军的代表所说的每一句话都深深地打动了全体与会者的心坎。
