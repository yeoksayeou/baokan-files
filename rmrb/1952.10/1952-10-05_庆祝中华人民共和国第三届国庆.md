    Telegram of Congratulations from the Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party,
    Duclos, to Chairman Mao
    To Chairman Mao Zedong:
    On the occasion of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party extends its sincerest respect and warmest congratulations to you, to express the friendship and admiration of the French people for the Chinese people.

    The valiant soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the fighting Chinese people, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, which is loyal to the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, have liberated China and are advancing from victory to victory.

    For three years, by mobilizing all the strength of the people and with the selfless and great help of the great Soviet Union, New China has achieved great achievements in all aspects, whether in the economic, political, or cultural fields.

    The fraternal and courageous assistance of the Chinese people to the heroic Korean people has defeated the American aggressors and their accomplice puppet states. They insidiously prepared to expand the war from Korea and Vietnam to the whole of Asia. Therefore, the Chinese people have made a great contribution to the victory of the cause of defending world peace.

    The Central Committee of the French Communist Party, the party of Thorez, and all French democrats and peace-loving people are deeply convinced that the great Chinese people, under the leadership of their Communist Party, will surely advance victoriously along a road that leads New China to prosperity!

    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!
    Long live the militant friendship between the French and Chinese peoples!
    Long live Stalin!
    Long live peace!
    The Central Committee of the French Communist Party, Jacques Duclos
