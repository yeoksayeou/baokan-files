    Czechoslovak Army Defending Peace
    Czechoslovakia　Procha

    Eleven years ago, the Czechoslovak army was born in the fires of World War II on Soviet soil. This army, established in the Soviet Union, fought alongside the Soviet army to return to its homeland, becoming the core of a new type of army – the Czechoslovak People's Army. To commemorate the heroic Czechoslovak army fighting alongside the Soviet army to reach Czechoslovak territory on October 6th, October 6th is designated as Czechoslovak Army Day.

    The birth and growth of the Czechoslovak People's Army are the result of the long-term struggle started by the Czechoslovak Communist Party in 1929 to create a people's army.

    The Czechoslovak Communist Party was founded in 1921. From then on, the Communist Party exposed the nature of the bourgeois mercenary army of the time—an instrument of imperialist anti-Soviet policy. The Czechoslovak Communist Party has always struggled for the creation of a people's army. In his first speech in parliament in 1929, Comrade Gottwald clarified the Communist Party's attitude towards the army. He said:

    "Yes, we are destroying that army used to oppose the people and the Soviet Union, we are destroying that army that you issue orders to and use the working people as cannon fodder; in short, we are now, and will continue to, destroy your bourgeois army, we are working to establish a Red Army, a proletarian army."

    In the following years, under the threat of German fascist forces, the Communist Party not only mobilized the working people to defend the motherland together, but also put forward in parliament a program to create a truly people's army against fascist aggression. At that time, Comrade Gottwald pointed out: "The conditions of soldiers must be improved, and the army must be democratized. It is especially necessary to improve the treatment of soldiers and junior officers, improve the food in the army, and restore and expand the civil rights of soldiers—especially the right to vote, the right to assembly, and the right to association. In addition, it is even more necessary to remove the reactionary and fascist elements in the army, especially among the officers, and conduct a systematic, anti-fascist propaganda education in the army; organize and strengthen the mutual connections between soldiers, entire units and factories, workers' organizations, and other organizations of the working people in cities and villages; strengthen the relationship between soldiers, companies and various companies of the Soviet army."

    Of course, the bourgeois rulers and the right-wing social democrats who colluded with them were unwilling and unable to organize the country's defense forces on the basis of the people. For the benefit of their class, the bourgeois rulers preferred to surrender to Hitler and the Munich Conference manipulated by Czechoslovakia’s "allies," the British and French imperialists, and disband the army, rather than join forces with the Soviet army to defend the homeland.

    After the German fascists occupied Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak Communist Party was the only party that led the people in the struggle against the fascist occupiers. After the German invaders invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, due to the leadership and assistance of the Supreme Command of the Soviet Army and the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Czechs and Slovaks living in the Soviet Union formed the Czechoslovak troops, thus laying the foundation for the new Czechoslovak army. At that time, Comrade Gottwald, the leader of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in Moscow, took on the organizational and political leadership of this new type of army. The first Czechoslovak troops, upon their own request, victoriously participated in the battle near Chakov with the Soviet army in January 1943. In its first battle, it destroyed 22 German tanks and wiped out 400 German invaders. The new Czechoslovak army victoriously participated in the battles of Kiev and Dukla, and fought side by side with the glorious Soviet army on the territory of the motherland all the way to Prague.

    Comrade Gottwald said in 1945: "We are not only building a new political life, rebuilding the motherland in social and economic terms, but also building a new type of army, which sees its ideal in the Red Army. Our soldiers, our corps, in the ranks of the Red Army, marched from Chakov to Ostrava, and then to Prague. This army of ours, together with our air force and the guerrillas in the country, will be the foundation of our new, truly democratic army. Our army will never again be used against the interests of the people and the country."

    The struggle to build an army continued. The Communist Party struggled to implement the first program announced by the Czechoslovak government in Kosice in 1945. The Kosice program included the Czechoslovak Communist Party's political and military policies on building a new type of army. With the help of British and American imperialism, the reactionary forces attempted to restore the capitalist system in Czechoslovakia, especially to destroy the army and turn it into a tool against the people. However, the reactionaries' attempt to control the army was thwarted by the working class and the Communist Party. In June 1948, when Comrade Gottwald was elected President of the Czechoslovak Republic and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, the struggle to build an army finally won a glorious victory.

    The cause of building a truly people's democratic army entered a new stage. The February victory of the working people basically eliminated unreliable elements, traitors and spies from the officers. Although the February events that defeated the enemies of the people had created all the necessary conditions for building an army according to the example of the Soviet army, these conditions were not fully utilized at that time.

    Based on this situation, and because imperialism turned its preparations for war into open aggression against the peaceful people of Korea, the Party decided to accelerate the work of building the army. The Party specially appointed Comrade Čepička, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and Secretary of the Political Bureau, as Minister of National Defense. This once again proves that the Czechoslovak Communist Party and Comrade Gottwald attach great importance to the army. Under the leadership of General Čepička, the Czechoslovak army successfully implemented thorough reforms in a short period of time. These reforms strengthened the leadership of the army and the role of the Party in the army, further democratized the army, and established a closer relationship with the great example—the Soviet army.

    According to the Ninth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in 1949 and subsequent resolutions, the work of building the army is developing rapidly and successfully. Thanks to President Gottwald and the vigilance of the entire Party, the sabotage activities of a small group of traitors and running dogs of British and American imperialism in the army were crushed. After the elimination of these saboteurs, a new enthusiasm for completing more tasks appeared in the army. The Czechoslovak army studied Soviet military science and Stalinist military technology, making them the basis of military preparation, and thereby promoting the rapid development of combat effectiveness. Now the experience of the Soviet army has been widely applied. The army has also adopted new training methods based on Soviet regulations. The selection of new cadres from the ranks of the working class and the use of the Party and Youth League organizations to strengthen political work has made the activities of these organizations unprecedentedly active, which has a huge effect on the completion of combat missions. Political education and cultural and sports activities have become the main driving forces for strengthening the ranks of soldiers and increasing the number of commanders. Educating cadres to serve the people's democratic motherland enables the army to further use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to strive to improve combat level and eliminate various shortcomings.

    The task of the Czechoslovak army is not aggression, but to defend socialism and the common motherland of Czechs and Slovaks, and to defend peace. This army, which belongs to the people, is loyal to the people, serves the people's democratic regime, has a high degree of political consciousness, conscious discipline, and masters a high degree of military science. Therefore, this army has been supported by the broad working people who enthusiastically provide them with new weapons and technologies.

    The Party and its chairman—the President of Czechoslovakia and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Comrade Gottwald—have made a historic and great contribution to the establishment of the Czechoslovak army. Only under his leadership can the army be built and become a loyal defender of the interests of the people and peace.

    Today, as the heinous war of imperialist aggression against the peaceful people of Korea reaches its third year, as imperialism is rapidly reviving the Nazi army, as they are rearming West Germany and Japan, the Czechoslovak army and the entire people will work harder to defend freedom and independence. The Czechoslovak Communist Party and President Gottwald are leading us to strive for this goal. President Gottwald wisely pointed out in his speech to the armed forces on May 6, 1951: Defending the socialist construction of our country is our main contribution to strengthening world peace. Comrade Gottwald said: "The task of building a strong army, a security force, and a militia is by no means contradictory to the struggle for peace. On the contrary, the stronger our armed forces are, the stronger the world peace camp will be."

    Under the guidance of Commander-in-Chief Gottwald, the Czechoslovak army is gloriously preparing to jointly undertake the lofty task of defending peace with the great, invincible Soviet army and the victorious army of People's China, which has been tempered in hundreds of battles, as well as the armies of other people's democratic countries. The stronger the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the stronger the armies of the Soviet Union, People's China and the people's democratic countries, the more quickly the British and American warmongers will abandon their attempts to instigate a new war.

    捷克斯洛伐克军队保卫着和平
    捷克斯洛伐克　普罗查
    十一年前，捷克斯洛伐克军队于第二次世界大战的炮火中，在苏联的土地上诞生了。在苏联成立的这支军队与苏军并肩作战，打回祖国去，成为一支新型的军队——捷克斯洛伐克人民军的核心。为了纪念英勇的捷克斯洛伐克军队在十月六日那天与苏军并肩作战而达到捷克斯洛伐克的国土，十月六日定为捷克斯洛伐克建军节。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民军的诞生和它的成长、壮大，是捷克斯洛伐克共产党为创立人民军而在一九二九年开始的长期斗争的结果。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党是在一九二一年成立的。从那时起共产党就揭露当时资产阶级的雇佣军队的性质——帝国主义的反苏政策的工具。捷克斯洛伐克共产党一贯为创立人民军队而斗争。哥特瓦尔德同志于一九二九年在议会上的第一次演讲中，阐明了共产党对于军队的态度。他说：
    “是的，我们正在破坏那支用来反对人民和反对苏联的军队，我们正在破坏那支由你们发布命令并使劳动人民充当炮灰的军队；总之，我们现在正在，而且将来也要继续破坏你们资产阶级的军队，我们正在为成立一支红军，一支无产阶级的军队而努力。”
    以后的几年中，在德国法西斯势力的威胁下，共产党不但动员了劳动人民共同保卫祖国，并且在议会中提出一个创立一支反法西斯侵略的真正人民军的纲领来。那时，哥特瓦尔德同志指出：“士兵的条件必须改善，军队必须民主化。尤其必要的是提高士兵和下级军官的待遇，改善军队中的伙食，恢复并扩大士兵的公民权——尤其是选举权、集会权和结社权。此外，更要清除军队中，尤其是军官中的反动和法西斯分子，在军队中进行一个有系统的、反法西斯的宣传教育；组织并加强士兵、整个部队与工厂、工人组织、城市和乡村中劳动人民其他各种组织之间的相互联系；加强士兵、连队与苏联军队各连队之间的关系。”
    当然，资产阶级统治者和与它相勾结的社会民主党右翼不愿意，也不可能以人民为基础来组织国家的防御力量。资产阶级统治者为了本阶级的利益，却宁愿向希特勒和捷克斯洛伐克“同盟者”英、法帝国主义操纵的慕尼黑会议投降并解散军队，而不愿意与苏军联盟共同捍卫国土。
    德国法西斯占领捷克斯洛伐克后，捷克斯洛伐克共产党是领导人民进行反法西斯占领者的斗争的唯一政党。一九四一年德寇侵入苏联后，由于苏军最高指挥部与捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导和协助，住在苏联的捷克人和斯洛伐克人就组成了捷克斯洛伐克部队，因而奠定了新的捷克斯洛伐克军队的基础。当时在莫斯科的捷共领袖哥特瓦尔德同志担负起对于这支新型军队的组织和政治领导工作。第一支捷克斯洛伐克部队在自动请缨之下，于一九四三年一月与苏军胜利地参加了查科夫附近的战役。它在首次作战中，击毁了德国坦克二十二辆，并歼灭德寇四百人。新的捷克斯洛伐克军队胜利地参加了基辅和杜克拉的战役，并在祖国的疆土上与光荣的苏军并肩作战直达布拉格。
    哥特瓦尔德同志在一九四五年说：“我们不但正在建设一个新的政治生活，正在社会和经济方面重建祖国，而且也正在建立一支新型的军队，这支军队在红军中看到它的理想。我们的士兵、我们的兵团在红军的行列中，由查科夫长征到俄斯特拉发，又到了布拉格。我们的这一支军队连同我们的空军以及国内的游击队，将是我们新的、真正民主的军队的基础。我们的军队将永远不会再被利用去反对人民和国家的利益。”
    争取建军的斗争仍继续下去。共产党为实现捷克斯洛伐克政府一九四五年在科息斯城所公布的第一个纲领而奋斗。科息斯纲领中，包括有捷克斯洛伐克共产党关于建立一支新型军队的政治和军事政策。反动势力在英、美帝国主义援助之下，企图在捷克斯洛伐克恢复资本主义制度，尤其是想破坏军队，把它变为反对人民的工具。但是反动派控制军队的企图被工人阶级和共产党挫败了。一九四八年六月，哥特瓦尔德同志被选为捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统兼武装部队总司令时，争取建军的斗争终于获得了光荣的胜利。
    建立一支真正的人民民主军队的事业进入了一个新的阶段。劳动人民的二月胜利在军官中基本上清除了不可靠的分子、卖国贼和间谍。虽然战胜人民敌人的二月事件已经为依照苏联军队的榜样而建立军队创立了一切必备的条件，但是当时这些条件并未能完全利用。
    根据这种情况，和由于帝国主义把备战转向对朝鲜和平人民的公开侵略，因此党就决定加速进行建设军队的工作。党特派捷共中央主席团委员兼政治局书记契皮茨卡同志担任国防部部长的职务。这又一次证明了捷共和哥特瓦尔德同志是极为重视军队的。捷克斯洛伐克军队在契皮茨卡上将的领导下，在短时期内胜利地实行了彻底的改革。这些改革加强了军队的领导和党在军队中的作用，使得军队进一步民主化并与伟大的榜样——苏联军队取得了更密切的联系。
    按照一九四九年捷克斯洛伐克共产党第九次大会和以后的决议，建设军队的工作迅速地、成功地向前发展着。感谢哥特瓦尔德总统，感谢全党的警惕性，军队中一小撮叛徒和英、美帝国主义走狗的破坏活动被粉碎了。在清除了这些破坏分子之后，军队中出现了为完成更多任务的、新的热情。捷克斯洛伐克军队学习了苏联军事科学和斯大林军事技术，使它们成为军事准备的基础，并由此而促使战斗力迅速发展。现在苏联军队的经验已被广泛应用。军队又根据苏联规定采用了新式训练方法。由工人阶级的队伍中选调新干部以及利用党与青年团的组织以加强政治工作，就使得这些组织的活动空前地活跃起来，这对于战斗任务的完成是有巨大作用的。政治教育与文化和体育的活动都成为壮大士兵行列和增加指挥官人数的主要推动力量。教育干部为人民民主的祖国而服务，就使得军队能够进一步利用批评与自我批评的武器以争取提高战斗水平和消除各种缺点。
    捷克斯洛伐克军队的任务不是侵略，而是保卫社会主义与捷克人和斯洛伐克人的共同祖国，以及保卫和平。这一支属于人民的军队忠于人民，为人民民主政权服务，有着高度的政治觉悟、自觉的纪律，而且是掌握着高度的军事科学的。所以，这支军队得到了热心供给他们新武器和技术的广大劳动人民的支援。
    党和党的主席——捷克斯洛伐克总统和军队的总司令哥特瓦尔德同志，对于建立捷克斯洛伐克军队有着历史性的伟大贡献。军队只有在他的领导之下才能建立起来并成为人民利益与和平的忠实保卫者。
    今天，当帝国主义侵略朝鲜和平人民的罪恶战争达到第三年的时候，当帝国主义迅速复活纳粹军队的时候，当他们重新武装西德和日本的时候，捷克斯洛伐克军队和全体人民更将努力保卫自由和独立。捷克斯洛伐克共产党和哥特瓦尔德总统正领导着我们为这一目的而努力。哥特瓦尔德总统在一九五一年五月六日对武装部队讲话中英明地指出：保卫我们国家的社会主义建设是我们对加强世界和平的主要贡献。哥特瓦尔德同志说：“建立起一支强大的军队、一支保安部队和民兵的任务，绝不是与争取和平的斗争相矛盾的。相反的，我们的武装力量越强大，则世界和平阵营也越坚强。”
    捷克斯洛伐克军队在哥特瓦尔德总司令指导之下，正在光荣地准备着和伟大的、不可战胜的苏军和久经战斗百炼成钢的人民中国的胜利军队，以及其他各人民民主国家的军队共同担负起保卫和平的崇高任务。以苏联为首的和平阵营力量越壮大，苏联、人民中国和各人民民主国家的军队愈加坚强，则英、美战争贩子们就会愈加迅速地放弃他们挑动新战争的企图。
