U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kennan's Shameful Behavior

The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the U.S. government on October 3 that it demanded the immediate recall of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kennan because he had been deemed persona non grata due to his malicious actions of slandering the Soviet Union. This is an upright diplomatic action taken by the Soviet government to safeguard the interests of the Soviet state and people.

It is known that U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kennan is a reactionary well-known for his anti-Soviet stance. His diplomatic career of nearly twenty years has mainly been devoted to espionage activities against the Soviet Union. He has been appreciated by the U.S. ruling clique for fabricating and distorting facts and promoting hatred of the Soviet Union. Therefore, since taking office as the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union this May, he has not strived to improve U.S.-Soviet relations but has used every opportunity to worsen relations between the two countries. Recently, Kennan, in his capacity as the U.S. Ambassador, publicly slandered the Soviet Union in West Berlin, comparing the situation of Americans in Moscow to his experience of being detained in Nazi Germany. This is completely a distortion of facts and an anti-Soviet fabrication. According to international law, a diplomat is a formal representative appointed by a country to conduct political relations with the host country, and is responsible for assisting in the development of relations between the two countries. He must perform his diplomatic duties in a friendly rather than hostile manner. Kennan's slander and defamation of the Soviet Union not only violated the moral character that a diplomatic official should have, but also violated the rules that diplomatic officials should abide by, which is absolutely intolerable to the Soviet people. It is entirely reasonable and in accordance with international practice for the Soviet government to insist that the United States immediately recall him.

Kennan's despicable lies are not worth refuting, because similar fabricated propaganda has long been exposed by representatives of people from all countries who have visited the Soviet Union. Anyone who has been to the Soviet Union will personally experience that the Soviet people have no reason to isolate themselves from the people of all countries in the world. They hope, rather than fear, that others can have a better understanding of them. A booklet published in the United States a few months ago, "We Saw It Ourselves," is a report written by nineteen prominent Americans after visiting the Soviet Union. They said, "We freely visited the places we chose ourselves, we talked to whoever we liked, and we went whenever we wanted." However, these representatives were subjected to various persecutions upon returning to their own country. The United States has also enacted laws prohibiting American people from going to the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, which shows that it is not others who restrict the actions of the American people in the Soviet Union and other countries, but the U.S. government itself. Because the U.S. ruling clique is most afraid of the American people knowing the truth about the Soviet Union.

For many years, a large number of facts have proven that the U.S. State Department has sent a large number of conspirators in diplomatic uniforms to the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries to carry out espionage and sabotage activities. Kennan's recent shameful behavior once again reflects the corruption of American political and diplomatic morality, and is even more despised by the people of all countries.

### 美国驻苏大使凯南的可耻行为

    美国驻苏大使凯南的可耻行为
    苏联外交部于十月三日通知美国政府，要求立即召回美国驻苏联大使凯南，因为由于他对苏联进行诬蔑的恶意行为，他已被认为是不受欢迎的人了。这是苏联政府为维护苏联国家和人民利益而采取的正直的外交行动。
    人们知道，美国驻苏联大使凯南是一个以反苏出名的反动分子。他近二十年的外交生涯主要是从事对苏联的间谍活动，靠了编造歪曲事实的情报和鼓吹仇视苏联而为美国统治集团所赏识。因此他自本年五月就任美国驻苏联大使以来，不是努力改善美苏关系而是利用一切机会使两国关系恶化。最近凯南竟以美国大使的身份，在柏林西区公开对苏联进行恶毒的诽谤，把美国人在莫斯科的情况和据说是他在纳粹德国被扣留时的经历相比拟。这完全是歪曲事实的反苏谰言。按照国际法，外交官是一国委派以与驻在国实施政治关系的正式代表，负有协助发展两国邦交的使命，必须是友好地而不是满怀敌意地执行他的外交职务。凯南这样对苏联进行造谣诬蔑，不但丧失了一个外交官员应有的品德，而且违反了外交官员应该遵守的规则，是苏联人民所绝难容忍的。苏联政府坚持美国立刻把他召回，是完全合理的，同时也是符合国际惯例的。
    凯南的卑鄙的谎言是不值一驳的。因为类似的虚构宣传早为曾经访问苏联的各国人民的代表们所揭穿了。凡是到过苏联的人们都会亲身体会到：苏联人民没有任何理由要把他们自己与世界各国人民相隔离，他们希望而不是害怕别人对他们能有更多的了解。几个月前在美国出版的一本小册子“我们亲眼看见的”，是十九位美国知名人士访问苏联后所写的报告，他们就说到：“我们自由地参观了我们自己所选的地方，我们喜欢找谁谈话就找谁谈话，愿意什么时候就在什么时候去。”而这些代表回到他们自己的国家，却受到各种各样的迫害。美国并且制订了禁止美国人民到苏联和各人民民主国家去的法律，这都说明了限制美国人民在苏联和其他国家行动的不是别人，而正是美国政府自己。因为美国统治集团最怕美国人民知道苏联的真实情况。
    多年以来，有大量的事实证明，美国国务院派遣了大批穿着外交服的阴谋家到苏联和各人民民主国家去进行间谍和破坏活动。凯南最近的可耻行为，又一次反映出美国政治和外交道德的堕落，而更为各国人民所不齿。
