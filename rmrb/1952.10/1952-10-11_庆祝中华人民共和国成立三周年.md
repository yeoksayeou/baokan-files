    Celebrating the Third Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China
    Liwa Yi, Minister of Culture of Hungary
    After the great October Socialist Revolution, the biggest blow to international imperialism—besides the Soviet victory over fascist Germany—was the founding of People’s China. Comrade Stalin had already wisely foreseen this as early as 1925, when he said: “The strength of the Chinese revolutionary movement is immeasurable... The rulers of the East and the West do not see these forces, do not estimate these forces to the extent they should... They will suffer for it.” Twenty-four years later, the tremendous revolutionary forces of the Chinese people triumphed, and the People’s Republic of China was founded. This fact definitively changed the balance of power on the international stage in favor of the anti-imperialist camp. Everything that has happened in the past three years has definitively confirmed what Comrade Mao Zedong said in 1949: “Our work will be written into the history of mankind... Our nation will henceforth be included in the great family of peace-loving and freedom-loving nations of the world, working with courage and diligence, creating its own civilization and happiness, and at the same time promoting world peace and freedom.”
    Precisely because the Chinese people followed the path indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong in their liberation struggle and have realized the ideals of Lenin and Stalin, the ideals embodied in China’s great example have also pointed the way for the oppressed peoples of colonial and semi-colonial countries. The founding of the People’s Republic of China is a great victory of world significance for all the oppressed and exploited people in colonial and semi-colonial countries striving for liberation. The people of the Near East and the Far East, as well as the oppressed and dependent people of Africa and South America, are increasingly consciously choosing, or will choose, the "Chinese path."
    Another manifestation of the historically significant role that the People’s Republic of China plays is that it resists the U.S. imperialist efforts to seek world hegemony on a decisive battlefield of the peace front. The U.S. imperialist's criminal aggression against the Korean people was also directed against China, with the aim of establishing a vast base in the Far East to realize its aggressive goals. The Chinese people, aware of this danger, immediately rose up to aid the Korean people. The Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, have contained the attacks of the imperialist bandits and continue to strike them blows. They are making extremely valuable contributions to the cause of peace.
    The old China, weak and divided, groaning under the shackles of the feudal landlord system and foreign imperialism and their accomplices in the "native" bourgeoisie, is gone forever. A new, powerful, and free country has risen in its place. The people of China, once backward and colonialized, have been advancing by leaps and bounds since liberation—marching forward at a speed never before seen in Chinese history. Extraordinary achievements have been made in land reform, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, restoring and developing China’s economy, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries in the past three years—all of which prove that the new people’s China has gradually become a powerful factor in international politics, a truly great democratic country, and one of the strongest guarantors of peace and freedom for the people of the world.
    The Chinese revolution was able to achieve victory, and the People's Republic of China was able to be established, because of the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union and because the Soviet army destroyed the military strength of fascist Germany and the military strength of imperialist and militarist Japan. The friendship between the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China (a friendship that has been further deepened by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance concluded on February 14, 1950, and by the recent Moscow talks and the agreements reached during those talks) is a guarantee that imperialism will not dare to act arbitrarily. Small Hungary also understands that the cooperation and alliance between the great Soviet people and the Chinese people are the guarantee of its development and its peaceful life and security.
    Although China and Hungary are far apart, a new type of economic, political, and cultural cooperation between free peoples is developing between small Hungary and large China. The Hungarian people have warm sympathy and friendly feelings for the heroic Chinese people, their glorious Communist Party, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, because the Hungarian people fully believe in the words of their leader, Comrade Rákosi:
    "The victory of the Chinese revolution is a clear and obvious proof of the strengthening and consolidation of the peace camp... This is a victory of great historical significance on a world scale, marking the greatest step forward in human progress since the Great October Socialist Revolution and the crushing of fascism."
    In the past, the Hungarian people, who groaned under the shackles of landlords and capitalists, knew almost nothing about the Chinese people. The oppressors of the Hungarian people described the Chinese people as a foreign race so distant that it was impossible to establish any relationship with them.
    Since the Hungarian people were liberated and the Chinese revolution was victorious, this situation has fundamentally changed. In the past three years, our two peoples have taken important steps towards mutual understanding by exchanging economic products and cultural achievements. The performances of the Chinese Youth Art Troupe in Hungary and the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe in China, in addition to demonstrating their great artistic achievements, also show that the great Chinese people and the Hungarian people who are building socialism are increasingly understanding and loving each other.
    The friendship between the Hungarian people and the Chinese people is built on a solid foundation. This friendship is beneficial to the great cause of peace, democracy, and progress. (Xinhua News Agency)

    庆祝中华人民共和国成立三周年
    匈牙利文化部部长　里瓦伊
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，对国际帝国主义的最大打击——除了苏联战胜法西斯主义的胜利以外——就是人民中国的成立。斯大林同志早在一九二五年就已经英明地预见到这点，当时他说：“中国革命运动底力量是不可计量的。……东方和西方的统治者看不到这些力量，不以应有的程度估计到这些力量，……他们将因此而吃苦头。”二十四年以后，中国人民的巨大的革命力量胜利了，中华人民共和国成立了。这个事实确定地改变了国际舞台上的力量对比，使之有利于反帝国主义阵营。过去三年来所发生的一切，已确定地证实了毛泽东同志在一九四九年所说的话：“我们的工作将写在人类的历史上……我们的民族将从此列入爱好和平自由的世界各民族的大家庭，以勇敢而勤劳的姿态工作着，创造自己的文明和幸福，同时也促进世界的和平和自由。”
    正因为中国人民遵循毛泽东同志所指示的道路进行了他们的解放斗争，已实现了列宁和斯大林的理想，所以中国的伟大榜样中所体现的理想也给被压迫的殖民地和半殖民地人民指明了道路。中华人民共和国的成立，对争取解放的殖民地和半殖民地国家中的一切被压迫和被剥削的人民是具有世界意义的伟大胜利。近东和远东的各国人民，以及非洲和南美的被压迫人民和附属国人民，都愈来愈自觉地在选择，或将要选择“中国的道路”。
    中华人民共和国起着具有世界意义的历史性作用的另一表现是：它在和平战线的一个具有决定性的战场上抵抗了美帝国主义谋取世界霸权的努力。美帝国主义对朝鲜人民发动的罪恶的侵略，也是针对着中国的，它的目的是在远东建立一个广大基地，以实现它的侵略目标。中国人民觉察到这种危险，立即起来援助朝鲜人民。中国志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩遏止了帝国主义匪徒的进攻，不断给匪徒们以打击，他们是在对和平事业作着极其宝贵的贡献。
    在封建的地主制度和外国帝国主义以及它们在“土著的”资产阶级中的同谋者的桎梏下辗转呻吟的、孱弱的、分裂的旧中国，是一去不复返了。一个新的、强大的自由的国家代之而兴起了。一度落后和殖民地化的中国的人民，自从解放以来一直大踏步地前进——以中国历史上从来没有过的速度向前迈进。三年来在土地改革、巩固工农联盟、恢复和发展中国经济以及镇压反革命方面，获得了非常的成就——所有这一切证明了新的人民的中国已逐渐成为国际政治中的一个强大的因素，一个真正伟大的民主国家，全世界人民的和平与自由的最强有力的保证者之一。
    中国革命之所以有可能取得胜利，中华人民共和国之所以有可能建立，是由于社会主义在苏联取得了胜利，由于苏联军队摧毁了法西斯德国的武力和帝国主义与军国主义日本的武力。苏联与中华人民共和国之间的友谊（这种友谊已因一九五○年二月十四日缔结的中苏友好同盟互助条约以及最近的莫斯科谈判和在这次谈判中达成的协议而进一步加深），是使帝国主义不敢任意胡作非为的保证。小国匈牙利也体察到伟大的苏联人民与中国人民的合作和同盟，是它的发展和它的和平生活与安全的保证。
    虽然中国与匈牙利相隔遥远，然而在小国匈牙利与大国中国之间，正在发展着自由人民的新式的经济、政治和文化的合作。匈牙利人民对英雄的中国人民、他们的光荣的共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志，有着热烈的同情与友好的感情，因为匈牙利人民完全相信他们的领袖拉科西同志的话：
    “中国革命的胜利，是和平阵营增强和巩固的一个清楚而明白的证明。……这是一个世界规模的具有重大历史意义的胜利，它标志着自从伟大的十月社会主义革命和粉碎法西斯主义以来人类进步所迈的最大一步。”
    在过去，辗转呻吟于大地主和资本家桎梏之下的匈牙利人民，几乎毫不了解中国人民，匈牙利人民的压迫者把中国人民描述成为一个那样遥远的外国种族，和他们是不可能建立任何关系的。
    自从匈牙利人民得到解放和中国革命得到胜利以后，这种情况有了根本的改变。在过去三年当中，我们两国人民藉着交流经济产品和文化成就，对互相了解采取了重要的步骤。中国青年文工团在匈牙利的旅行表演，以及匈牙利国家人民文工团在中国的旅行表演，除了表明他们伟大的艺术成就以外，而且表明伟大的中国人民和正在建立社会主义的匈牙利人民，愈来愈互相了解和相亲相爱了。
    匈牙利人民和中国人民的友谊是建立在坚固的基础之上的。这种友谊是有益于和平、民主和进步的伟大事业的。        （新华社）
