    Chilean Representative, Retired Officer
    Alfredo di Amesti's Speech (Summary)
    Until now, the Pacific Ocean has always separated our countries. Imperialism has turned the Pacific Ocean into a sea of war and a thoroughfare for aggression and conquest against the peoples of the East and the Americas. The aggressors crossed this ocean to invade Korea. Today, we all hold a firm belief that this conference will powerfully promote the actions of the people, an action that will ultimately transform the Pacific Ocean into a sea of peace in the truest sense of the word, a sea of friendship between all nations and countries.
    Most of us are united by a common goal, and we must not, at any moment, separate this goal from the struggle for peace. This common goal is the struggle for national independence.
    Chile and the entire Latin America understand from their own experience that there is a close connection between these two issues.
    During World War II, Chile lost 500 million US dollars due to the arbitrary limitation of the low price of our copper production by the United States. Chile, the second largest copper producer in the world, had 80% of its copper purchased by the United States for less than 30 cents per pound. In reality, Chile only received tariff income. However, the international copper price always fluctuated around 50 cents per pound. Due to this manipulation, Chile suffered a loss amounting to half of the country's annual budget. Within this budget, the increase in military expenditure was equivalent to the reduction in public health expenditure. There, due to poor living conditions, tuberculosis is prevalent; the cause of infant mortality persists, resulting in the death of one-sixth of infants under one year old; and more than half of the population lives in a state of chronic malnutrition.
    As Chile has become a cog in the wheel of global aggression, the cost of living has risen sharply, people are increasingly underfed, and housing conditions have deteriorated further. Currently, 50% of the housing is unsanitary, and in a country with only six million inhabitants, there is a shortage of 500,000 homes.
    The money earned in our country by two American companies, Anaconda Copper Company and Braden Copper Company, actually amounts to one-third of the total income of all Chileans in various businesses. If the profits of these two companies were used to solve the housing problem, the problem could be completely solved in five years. If 15% of these profits were used for education, then the tragedy of 530,000 children being out of school due to the lack of teachers and school buildings could be eliminated in one year. All these things, and even more, could be done as long as Chile's raw materials truly belong to itself, as long as we have the atmosphere of friendly coexistence in our country that we breathe here.
    When the aggression against the heroic Korean people was launched, the government indicated its intention to dispatch regular troops, under the command of General MacArthur, to participate in the war. This immediately sparked a resounding roar of opposition among the entire people. Widespread unified action disrupted the rulers' decision. The fact is very clear: the Chilean people oppose war against the people of Korea, China, the Soviet Union, or any other country in the world; they want to maintain friendship and coexistence with these people. Our people are also unwilling to participate in germ warfare. On the contrary, they condemn bacteriological weapons, just as they condemned the use of atomic bombs in the past in a vigorous movement. Today, they want to reiterate their position before the delegates participating in this conference, firmly supporting the demand for an immediate end to the war in Korea and other parts of Asia. At the same time, they condemn the atrocities of using weapons prohibited by the 1925 Geneva Protocol to massacre peaceful residents. So far, seven Latin American countries have received copies of the same agreement. Chile has also received a copy. This agreement has implemented an American law in Chile – the Security Act, which hands over all of Chile's human and material resources to the American war machine, while also granting diplomatic privileges to an unlimited number of American soldiers. This convention even restricts our country's opportunities for free trade with the world. These conventions, on the one hand, support American monopolies, and on the other hand, only arm certain countries among us, thereby stirring up hostility among Latin American countries.
    The seven countries that signed these conventions (three of which are located on the Pacific coast) have already sacrificed their economic, political, and military autonomy. The State Department in Washington has only allocated a total of 38 million US dollars to be divided among these countries. Our war profiteers, for these 38 million US dollars, have sold out all the human and material resources and all the economic prospects of seven Latin American countries, selling them into a shameful state of slavery.
    Chilean public opinion has probably never engaged in such a dramatic and large-scale battle as the struggle carried out in the streets for six anxious weeks against this military agreement. Nitrate miners and coal miners went on strike; students, women, and intellectuals fought the police. People from very different walks of life have united in this resistance movement.
    This convention was approved under shameful circumstances, approved by the government and a congress that disregarded the will of the people. The people vowed never to allow this convention to be implemented. The next day, to celebrate the approval of the convention, an American fleet docked in the port of Valparaiso. But the resentment in the streets and alleys was so great that the fleet had to set sail immediately after anchoring.
    The war profiteers have also forced the Chilean government to sign the peace treaty with Japan, in order to comply with the intention of the US State Department and the Pentagon to turn Japan into the main Pacific base for launching World War III. In the Senate of the Republic of Chile, the members representing the will of the people opposed the ratification of this treaty, because this treaty will accelerate the rearmament of Japan and threaten world peace. Today, through our delegation participating in this conference, our people reaffirm their determination, expressing their firm support for this movement to quickly resolve the Japanese issue, supporting the end of foreign occupation, and the movement to conclude a genuine peace treaty.
    So far, 750,000 people in Chile have signed the declaration demanding that the five major powers sign a peace pact. We hope that when we attend the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna in December, we can bring with us the one million signatures that we have pledged to collect. We believe that we can achieve this goal, because in Chile, the sentiment of striving for national liberation, which is closely linked to the struggle for peace, is developing rapidly. The understanding that Chile must be the master of its own raw materials, deciding its own domestic and foreign policies, has matured more rapidly in the past five years than ever before.
    The signature collection campaign has inspired people to complete the task with greater enthusiasm, which is to send a large Chilean delegation to participate in the Beijing Conference. This delegation is composed of twenty-five men and women representing various political, social, religious, and professional identities.
    Here, we cannot fail to mention a great victory of the peace movement, the significance of which you understand more clearly than anyone else. This is the return of Pablo Neruda to Chile.
    To prepare for this historic conference we are now holding in Beijing, Neruda gave a memorable speech to thousands of people a few days after arriving in Chile. In his speech, Neruda painted a vivid picture of this great peaceful region that he loves from the bottom of his heart. He enabled us to deeply imagine how beautiful a liberated China is, and how wholeheartedly it is dedicated to defending peace and to realizing its economic and social progress. Now that we are in China, we are completely confident of this, because we have personally seen: the great mass parade on October 1st fully expressed the people's confidence in their own destiny and severely warned the aggressors.
    The Chilean delegation came to Beijing, having traveled through four continents and an ocean. We are very happy to have had this journey, because along the way we encountered many people from various countries who are completely dedicated to peaceful labor. Seeing these things has strengthened our confidence, making us certain that the noble cause of peace cannot be destroyed.
    In the schools of our distant homeland, teachers tell everyone that China is at the farthest end of the earth. Nevertheless, we feel completely at home in this country, because we are enveloped by the friendship and affection of the people of this country. Although we are only beginning to get to know each other, we already feel that we and the Chinese people are old friends. We truly feel that we are brothers, because peaceful people of all countries are brothers.
    After we return to Chile, we must loudly tell everyone everything we have seen and experienced at this conference and in this country. We intend to spread our mission everywhere.
    Undoubtedly, the resolutions passed here, the result of such a full and democratic exchange of views, will strengthen the power and organization of the peace movement. It will powerfully inspire the national liberation movement in Latin America. Everything we have seen here makes us even more convinced that war can be avoided by collective action.
    Respectable delegates: Please allow me to express the deep sense of camaraderie that our brothers in Asia, closely watched by our American countries, are fighting with. We will never forget your contribution to the struggle for independence in colonial countries. We not only eagerly hope to coexist peacefully with you; but also will fight tirelessly for this.

### 智利代表、退伍军官  阿尔弗莱脱·第·阿迈斯脱的发言（摘要）

    智利代表、退伍军官
    阿尔弗莱脱·第·阿迈斯脱的发言（摘要）
    直到现在，太平洋老是把我们这些国家隔开，帝国主义把太平洋变成了一个战争的海洋以及侵略和征服东方与美洲各国人民的大道。侵略者越过了这个海洋侵略朝鲜。今天我们都抱着一个坚定的信念，相信这次会议将有力地推动人民的行动，这个行动终必使太平洋变成名符其实的和平的海洋，各民族各国家之间友好的海洋。
    我们大多数人由于一个共同的目标而团结在一起了，我们每时每刻都不能把这个目标与争取和平的斗争分开，这个共同的目标就是争取民族的独立。
    智利与整个拉丁美洲从自己亲身的经验中体会到：这两个问题中间存在着密切的联系。
    在第二次世界大战期间，由于美国武断地限定了我们铜产的低微价格，智利损失了五万万美元。铜产量在世界上居第二位的智利，百分之八十的铜产都由美国收购，价钱每磅不到三角，实际上，智利所得不过是关税收入而已。而国际铜价总在每磅五角左右起伏。由于这个摆布，智利蒙受了为数几达国家全年预算之半的损失，在这个预算中，军事费用的增加，相当于公共卫生经费削减的数目。而在那儿，由于生活条件的恶劣，肺结核病流行；婴儿夭折的原因一直存在，造成六分之一未满周岁的婴儿的死亡；人口半数以上都生活在慢性的营养不良的状况中。
    由于智利已经成为世界侵略巨轮上的一个轮齿，生活费用就急遽上升，人民越来越吃不饱饭，住屋的情况更恶化了，目前住屋中百分之五十是不卫生的，而在一个仅有六百万居民的国家中，就缺少五十万所住屋。
    两家美国公司，安那康达铜业公司与布拉登铜业公司，在我国赚到的钱，实际上就相当所有智利人在各种经营中全部收入的三分之一。假如把这两家公司的利润用来解决房屋问题，那么问题在五年内就可以全部解决。假如这些利润的百分之十五用到教育方面，那末由于教员与校舍缺少而使五十三万儿童失学的悲剧，就可在一年内消除。所有这些事，甚至比这更多的事，都可以办到，只要智利的原料真正归它自己所有，只要在我国具有像我们这里所呼吸到的，友好共存的气氛。
    当对英勇的朝鲜人民的侵略开始发动的时候，政府表示要派遣正规军队，在麦克阿瑟将军的指挥下，参加作战。这立即在全体人民中激起了响亮的反对的怒吼。广泛的一致行动打乱了统治者的决定。事实非常明显，智利人民反对对朝鲜、对中国、对苏联、或者对世界其他任何国家的人民进行战争，他们要和这些人民保持友谊和共存。我们的人民也不愿参加细菌战。相反地，他们谴责细菌武器，正如他们过去在轰轰烈烈的运动中谴责使用原子弹一样。今天，他们要在参加这次会议的诸位代表面前重申他们的立场，坚决支持立即停止朝鲜和亚洲其他地区的战争的要求。同时，斥责使用一九二五年日内瓦议定书所禁止使用的武器来屠杀和平居民的暴行。到现在为止，已经有七个拉丁美洲的国家收到了同一个协定的副本。智利也收到了一份。这个协定在智利实行了一个美国的法律——安全法，把智利的一切人力与原料的资源都交给了美国的战争机器，同时也把外交特权给予数量上不加限制的美国兵士。这个公约甚至于限制了我国与全世界进行自由贸易的机会。这些公约一面支持着美国的垄断，一面却只武装了我们这些国家中的某几国，这样来煽起拉丁美洲各国间的敌对。
    在这些公约上签了字的七个国家（其中有三个是位于太平洋沿岸），已经葬送了它们在经济上、政治上和军事上的自主权。华盛顿的国务院总共只拨了三千八百万美元来分给这些国家。我们的战争贩子们为了这三千八百万美元，出卖了七个拉丁美洲国家的一切人力、一切原料资源和一切经济前途，出卖了它们，使它们陷于可耻的奴隶地位。
    智利的舆论可能从来没有从事过如此富于戏剧性和大规模的战斗，像在六个使人焦虑的星期中，为了反对这个军事协定而在街道上进行的斗争那样。硝矿工人和煤矿工人举行了罢工；学生、妇女和知识分子向警察进行了斗争。极不相同的各界人们都在这次反抗运动中团结起来了。
    这个公约是在可耻的情况下批准的，是由政府和一个不顾人民意志的国会所批准的。人民发誓决不让这公约得到履行。第二天，为了庆祝公约的批准，在法尔巴来索港停泊了一个美国舰队。但是大街小巷中反感是如此之大，使这个舰队不得不刚刚抛锚，就立刻启程他去。
    战争贩子又迫使智利政府签订对日和约，这样来符合美国国务院和五角大楼想把日本变成发动第三次世界大战的主要的太平洋基地的意图。在智利共和国的参议院里代表民意的议员反对批准这个条约，因为这个条约将加速日本的重新武装并威胁世界的和平。今天，通过参加这次会议的我国的代表团，我国人民重申他们的决心，表示坚决支持这个争取迅速解决日本问题的运动，支持终止外国占领，和缔结真正和约的运动。
    到现在为止，智利已有七十五万人在要求五大国签订和平公约的宣言上签了名。我们希望我们在十二月出席维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会的时候能带去我们所保证要收集到的一百万个签名。我们相信我们能够达到这一个目标的，因为在智利，和争取和平的斗争密切连系着的争取民族解放的情绪正在迅速地发展着。智利必须成为它自己的原料的主人，决定它自己的国内外的政策——这种认识在过去五年中比以往任何时期成熟得更为迅速了。
    征集签名的运动鼓舞了人们，使他们更加热情地来完成这件任务，那就是派遣一个人数多的智利代表团来参加北京会议。这个代表团由代表各种不同的政治、社会、宗教和职业的身份的二十五个男女所组成。
    在这里我们不能不提到和平运动的一次伟大胜利，这件事的重大意义你们是比任何人都更清楚的。这就是巴勃罗·聂鲁达的返回智利。
    为了筹备我们现在正在北京举行的这个历史性的会议，聂鲁达在到达智利几天以后就向几千人作了一个使人永志不忘的演说。在他的演说中，聂鲁达替他从心底里热爱着的这个伟大的和平地区，描绘出了一幅生动的图画。他使我们能够深切地想像到解放了的中国是如何美丽，是如何全心全意地献身于保卫和平、献身于实现它经济与社会的进步。现在我们已经在中国了，我们对此是完全有信心了，因为我们已亲自看到了：十月一日伟大的群众游行充分地表示了人民对自己的命运有着信心，并且严重地警告了侵略者。
    智利代表团到北京来，要经过四个洲和一个大洋。我们很高兴能有这样一次旅程，因为在途中我们碰到了许多完全献身于和平劳动的各国人民，看到了这些，就加强了我们的信心，使我们确信崇高的和平事业是破坏不了的。
    在我们遥远的祖国的学校里，教师们告诉大家说：中国在地球上最远的极端。虽然如此，我们在这个国家里觉得完全像在家里一样，因为我们被这个国家的人民的友谊与感情笼罩起来了。虽然我们还只是在开始相互认识，可是我们已经感到我们和中国人民是老朋友了。我们真的感到我们是弟兄，因为各国的和平的人们都是弟兄。
    我们回到智利后，一定要高声地告诉大家我们在这个会议和这个国家里所看到和经历到的一切。我们打算到处去传播我们的使命。
    无疑地，这儿所通过的决议，这么充分而民主的交换意见的结果，将会加强和平运动的力量和组织。它将有力地鼓舞起拉丁美洲的民族解放运动。我们在这儿所看到的一切使我们愈加坚定地相信：战争是能够以集体行动来避免的。
    可尊敬的代表们：请允许我表达我们美洲各国密切注意着的我们的兄弟们在亚洲进行的斗争的那种深切的战友之情。我们永远不会忘记你们对于殖民地国家争取独立的贡献。我们不仅热望和你们和平共处；而且将不停息地为此奋斗。    （新华社）
