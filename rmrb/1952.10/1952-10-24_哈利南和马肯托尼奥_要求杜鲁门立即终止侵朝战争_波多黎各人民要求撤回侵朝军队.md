Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 22nd: According to TASS, New York, October 21st: Hallinan, the presidential candidate of the American Progressive Party, sent a telegram to U.S. President Truman, demanding an immediate end to hostilities in Korea and asking Truman to explain why he refuses to do so. The telegram stated: "Politicians of both old parties are using American casualties in Korea as their political capital, and no one is offering any suggestion to stop the slaughter. This behavior has aroused the disgust and anger of the American people..."

Former Congressman Marcantonio also demanded that Truman immediately stop the slaughter in Korea. In a letter to Truman, Marcantonio wrote: "Your refusal to do so can only mean one thing: that you want the war to continue after the election, so that you can expand this war."

Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 23rd: TASS, New York, October 22nd: Reports from Puerto Rico continue to show that the vast majority of the Puerto Rican people universally demand the withdrawal of Puerto Rican troops fighting in Korea and oppose the further recruitment of young people into the U.S. military. Even conservative parties such as the "Political Party" are demanding the withdrawal of Puerto Rican troops from Korea, which proves the anti-war sentiment of the Puerto Rican people.

The well-known San Juan newspaper "El Mundo" published an open letter signed by sixty-five women whose relatives are fighting in Korea, opposing the sacrifice of Puerto Ricans in Korea.

    哈利南和马肯托尼奥
    要求杜鲁门立即终止侵朝战争
    波多黎各人民要求撤回侵朝军队
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：美国进步党总统候选人哈利南致电美国总统杜鲁门，要求立即终止朝鲜的敌对行动，并且要求杜鲁门解释为什么拒绝这样做。电报说：“两个老政党的政客都把美国在朝鲜的伤亡作为他们的政治资本，谁也不提出任何制止屠杀的建议，他们这种表现已引起美国人民的憎恶和愤怒。……”
    前国会议员马肯托尼奥也要求杜鲁门立即制止在朝鲜的屠杀。马肯托尼奥在给杜鲁门的信中写道：“你如果拒绝这样做就只能说明一件事情，就是，你想要战争在大选完结之后还继续下去，以便使你得以扩大这个战争。”
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：现在从波多黎各来的报道继续表明：波多黎各广大人民普遍要求撤回在朝鲜作战的波多黎各军队，并反对再征募青年参加美国军队。甚至如“政治家党”等保守党派也要求把波多黎各军队从朝鲜撤回来，这证明了波多黎各人民的反战情绪。
    圣约翰城有名的报纸
    “世界报”发表了有亲属在朝鲜作战的六十五位妇女署名的一封公开信，这封信反对在朝鲜拿波多黎各人作牺牲。
