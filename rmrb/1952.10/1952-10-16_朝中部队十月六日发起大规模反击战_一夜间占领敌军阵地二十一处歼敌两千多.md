Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 15th -- The Korean and Chinese People's troops launched a considerably large-scale counterattack on the American invading forces and their accomplice troops on October 6th. That evening and after nightfall, on a front line stretching over a hundred kilometers from west to east, our troops launched attacks on enemy positions in more than twenty areas. Our heroic infantry, in coordination with powerful artillery and tank units, quickly and bravely broke into the enemy's positions. As a result of the battle, our troops captured twenty-one enemy positions. Except for two positions where the enemy fled in fear of being annihilated, the defending enemies in the other sixteen positions were completely annihilated, and the defending enemies in three positions were mostly annihilated. In another position, over eight hundred of the defending enemies were annihilated. The progress of the battles in all areas was very rapid. On the western front, a unit of our troops counterattacked Songwuli North Mountain and Xiangdongli West Mountain, northwest of Gaolangpu-ri, and completely annihilated an American company of defending enemies in only ninety minutes of fierce fighting. On a mountain ridge shaped like a chair near Lidong, southeast of Jincheng on the central front, a unit of our troops completely annihilated a battalion command post, a company, and four platoons of the Rhee puppet army's Gyeonggi Division in just twenty minutes. In the battle in this area, after our troops captured the main peak of the mountain ridge and annihilated most of the enemy, they also annihilated all the remaining enemies who retreated into the tunnels. According to preliminary statistics, in this counterattack, our troops annihilated three enemy companies, twenty platoons, and four squads, totaling more than two thousand six hundred enemies.
