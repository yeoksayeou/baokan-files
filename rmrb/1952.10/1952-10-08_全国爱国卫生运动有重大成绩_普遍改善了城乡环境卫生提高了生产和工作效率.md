Since the launch of the National Patriotic Health Campaign nationwide this spring, significant achievements have been made. Many cities and villages have changed their appearance, and the broad masses of the people have developed habits of paying attention to hygiene, resulting in a significant reduction in the incidence of disease.

In terms of environmental hygiene, according to incomplete statistics, various localities have cleared more than 15 million tons of garbage; dredged more than 50,000 *li* of sewage rivers and ditches; and filled in sewage pits and ditches with an area of more than 1.3 million square meters and a volume of more than 24 million cubic meters (plus more than 90,000 places not included in the calculation). Many places' sewage ponds, ditches, and garbage dumps have been transformed into public entertainment and recreation areas after being filled and cleaned. For example, Taoranting and Longtan in Beijing were originally stinking water pits, but now they have become scenic spots; in the fifth district of Wuhan, there was a vacant lot where dozens of tons of garbage used to be piled up, but now the masses have cleared the garbage and installed street lights and built a stage on the vacant lot, making it a place for cultural entertainment. Many stagnant rivers have become living rivers. For example, the small river in Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, runs from the North Gate through the outside of the Great East Gate to the Tuo River, with a total length of more than 3,970 meters. It has been blocked for more than 100 years, but now this small river has been dredged; the Qinhuai River in Nanjing, which has been stinking for hundreds of years, has now become crystal clear. More than 1.5 million toilets have been rebuilt and newly built, and most of the manure pits have been covered. During the campaign, people in various localities widely carried out the work of eliminating disease-carrying animals such as mosquitoes and flies. According to recent incomplete statistics, people in various localities have captured and killed more than 44.49 million rats, and eliminated more than 2 million *jin* and more than 19 billion harmful insects such as flies, mosquitoes, fleas, mosquito larvae, maggots, and lice. Many places have seen the emergence of "fly-free zones."

The improvement of environmental hygiene and the development of people's clean hygiene habits have greatly reduced the number of patients with infectious diseases this year. For example, the incidence of gastroenteritis in Tianjin in June this year was 40 percent lower than in April last year. Compared with the same period in 1950, the number of deaths due to gastrointestinal diseases in Beijing from April to June this year decreased to 35 percent; the incidence of other acute infectious diseases also decreased by 29 percent. From January to May this year, the incidence of some infectious diseases and other diseases in Qingdao and Shenyang was only slightly more than 40 percent of that in the same period last year. In the vast rural areas, the infant mortality rate used to be very high, but this year there has been a significant change. According to surveys in Guanghan, Shifang, Peng County and other places in western Sichuan, because farmers have generally adopted new methods of midwifery, the infant birth mortality rate has dropped from about 50 percent before liberation to about 3 percent. The mortality rate of pigs and cattle has decreased by 40 to 75 percent compared with the past. In Liulin Village, Lin County, Pingyuan Province, people used to die every year from seasonal infectious diseases such as malaria and dysentery, but these diseases have almost disappeared this year.

The health campaigns in various localities are closely integrated with production work. The improvement of environmental hygiene in factories, mines, and rural areas has ensured the smooth completion of production tasks. In the coking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, coal dust used to fly everywhere, and it was difficult to start cleaning and hygiene work. However, in the Patriotic Health Campaign, the workers launched a hygiene challenge competition using methods such as inspection, evaluation, scoring, and grading, and made every workshop and machine clean. This improved the hygiene work in the factory, as well as the maintenance work, and extended the life of the machines. Since the launch of the Patriotic Health Campaign, the safety and hygiene situation of the Hangzhou Kaiyuan Silk Factory has been greatly improved, the diseases of employees have been greatly reduced, and the production level has been significantly improved. The same is true in rural areas. Taking Zhejiang Province as an example, according to incomplete statistics, the province's rural areas have accumulated more than 4,700 tons of fertilizer in the general cleaning. Zhu Genhua, a farmer in Kaihua County, Zhejiang Province, said: "During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, my family was terribly dirty, and one or the other was always sick. Now everyone in my family is healthy, and I am more confident in striving for a bumper harvest." Under the slogan of "turning household soil into field fertilizer" and "clean homes mean fertile fields, fewer people get sick and more grain is harvested," 180 townships in Yancheng, northern Jiangsu, carried out a major cleaning. In the suburbs of Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, Panshan, Jin County, and many other rural areas, the clearing of garbage and the management of manure have greatly increased the amount of fertilizer applied and the area fertilized, which has played a significant role in increasing the yield per unit area.

The work of public dietary hygiene has also been significantly improved. Street food vendors and cooks in restaurants in cities have put on clean white aprons. Many vegetable markets in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Shanghai have prepared bleaching powder solutions for disinfecting vegetables, and meat and fish stalls, as well as many food stalls, have been covered with glass and gauze covers; all utensils and drinks in ice cream parlors have undergone disinfection procedures; and many public drinking water places have potassium permanganate disinfectant water. In terms of drinking water disinfection, in addition to improving water sources, many places without tap water facilities in large cities have universally established drinking water disinfection stations, so that citizens can drink clean water. Many farmers no longer drink pond water, stream water, or river water, but have switched to drinking disinfected well water. According to incomplete statistics, in this campaign, a total of more than 446,000 new and renovated water wells have been constructed across the country, and the Northeast region alone has built and renovated more than 289,700 water wells. Most of the water wells have been covered. Herdsmen on the grasslands of Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia not only covered the wells, but also built well houses to protect them.

The level of health knowledge of the broad masses of the people is also constantly improving with the development of the Patriotic Health Campaign. Many food service workers in cities have universally developed good habits of regularly trimming their nails and washing their hands for disinfection. Farmers also brush their teeth with toothbrushes and drink cold boiled water. In ethnic minority areas, many people used to not know how to pay attention to hygiene, and they always kowtowed and prayed to gods when they were sick. Now they have gradually changed this habit. Herdsmen on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia used to often not wash the milking buckets. Now, they not only rinse them with boiling water before milking, but also filter the milk once with clean white fine cloth before making dairy products. Most young and middle-aged male and female herdsmen have bought teacups and toothbrushes. Women have also begun to use hygienic sanitary napkins, and no longer go to the fields to give birth. Many women have also accepted new methods of midwifery. In order to maintain these good hygiene habits on a regular basis, people in various localities have established "Patriotic Health Inspection Days" and Patriotic Health Pacts on a voluntary basis. In addition to establishing Patriotic Health Pacts, many factory, mine workers, and rural farmers have also listed hygiene performance as one of the standards for evaluating production. The above-mentioned gains of the Patriotic Health Campaign have not only guaranteed the health of the people, but also created important conditions for the large-scale development of the motherland's economic construction and national defense construction.

    全国爱国卫生运动有重大成绩
    普遍改善了城乡环境卫生提高了生产和工作效率
    爱国卫生运动从今年春季在全国范围内开展以来，获得了显著的成绩。许多城市和乡村改变了面貌，广大人民养成了注意卫生的习惯，使发病率大大地降低。
    在环境卫生方面，据不完全的统计，各地共清除了一千五百万吨以上的垃圾；疏浚了长达五万多华里的污水河、沟；填平的污水坑、沟，以面积计算的有一百三十多万平方公尺，以体积计算的有二千四百多万立方公尺（另有九万多处未计算在内）。许多地方的污水塘、沟和垃圾场，经填平和清扫以后，已改建为公共娱乐休息的场所。例如北京市的陶然亭和龙潭，原来都是臭水坑，现在已变成风景区；武汉市第五区有一块空地，过去上面堆积着几十吨的垃圾，现在群众已将垃圾清除了，并在空地上装了路灯、砌了戏台，使它成为文化娱乐的场所。许多死水河变成了活水河，例如四川资中县城区的小河沟，从北门穿到大东门外直达沱江，全长三千九百七十多公尺，淤塞了一百多年，现在已把这小河疏通了；臭了几百年的南京秦淮河，现在变成了清澄澄的了。改建和新建的厕所已有一百五十多万处，粪坑大部都加上了盖子。在运动中，各地人民广泛地开展了扑灭蚊、蝇等病媒动物的工作。据最近的不完全的统计，各地人民共捕杀老鼠四千四百九十多万只，消灭蝇、蚊、蚤、孑孓、蛆、虱等害虫二百多万斤又一百九十多亿只。许多地方出现了“无蝇区”。
    环境卫生的改善和人民清洁卫生习惯的养成，使得今年的传染病患者大为减少。例如天津今年六月份肠胃炎传染病比去年四月份减低百分之四十。北京市今年四月至六月因患肠胃病而死亡的人数与一九五○年同期比较，降低到百分之三十五；其它急性传染病的发病率也降低了百分之二十九。青岛、沈阳市自今年一月至五月，一些传染病及其它疾病的发病率仅及去年同期的百分之四十强。在广大农村中，过去婴儿死亡率很高，今年却有了显著的改变。据川西广汉、什邡、彭县等地的调查，因为农民普遍采用了新接生法，婴儿出生死亡率由解放前的百分之五十降低到百分之三左右。猪、牛死亡率比过去减少百分之四十至七十五。平原省林县柳林村过去每年有人死于疟疾、痢疾等季节性的传染病，但今年这些疾病几乎绝迹了。
    各地卫生运动密切结合生产工作。工厂、矿山和农村的环境卫生的改善，保证了生产任务的顺利完成。太原钢铁厂炼焦部，过去煤末尘埃四处飞扬，清洁卫生工作很难着手，但在爱国卫生运动中，工人们用检查评比、记分定级等办法掀起了卫生挑战竞赛，把每个车间和机器都弄得干干净净，这样就改进了厂内的卫生工作，也改进和推广了检修工作，延长了机器的寿命。杭州开源丝厂自开展爱国卫生运动以来，安全卫生情况大有改进，职工的疾病大有减少，生产水平有显著提高。在农村方面，也有同样的情况。以浙江省为例，据不完全的统计，全省农村在清洁大扫除中共积肥四千七百余吨。该省开化县农民祝根花说：“在国民党反动派统治时期，家里脏得要命，不是这个生病，就是那个生病，现在我一家人个个身体健康，争取丰收更有信心了。”苏北盐城一百八十个乡，在“家土变野肥”、“家里干净田里肥，人少生病粮多收”的口号下，进行了大扫除。辽西锦州市郊区、盘山、锦县和其他许多农村，由于清除了垃圾，管理了粪便，大大增加了施肥量和施肥面积，对提高单位面积产量，起了很大作用。
    公共饮食卫生工作也有了显著的改进。城市里的饮食摊贩和饭馆的厨子，都穿上了洁白的围裙。北京、天津、沈阳、上海等城市许多菜市场，都置备了供蔬菜消毒用的漂白粉溶液，肉案和鱼摊以及许多饮食摊都加上了玻璃罩和纱罩；冷饮店的一切用具和饮用品都经过消毒的手续；许多公共饮水处都设有过锰酸钾消毒水。在饮水消毒方面，除了改善水源以外，大城市里许多没有自来水设备的地方，普遍设立了饮水消毒站，使市民能够饮用洁净的水。很多农民也不再饮塘水、溪水、河水了，都改饮经过消毒的井水。据不完全的统计，在这次运动中，全国新开掘的和改修的水井共有四十四万六千多口，仅东北区就新建和改修水井二十八万九千七百余口。大部水井都加上了盖子。绥远、内蒙古草原上的牧民不但在水井上加了盖子，而且还搭起保护水井的井房子。
    广大人民的卫生知识水平也随着爱国卫生运动的发展不断地提高。不少城市饮食业的工作人员普遍养成了常剪指甲、常洗手消毒的良好习惯。农民们也用牙刷刷牙，喝冷开水。少数民族地区，不少人过去不知道讲卫生，有了病总是叩头求神，现在他们逐渐改变了这种习惯。内蒙古草原上的牧民过去常不冲洗挤奶桶，现在不仅在挤奶前用开水冲洗一遍，而且在作奶食前还用洁白的细布把奶滤过一次。青壮年男女牧民大多买了茶缸和牙刷。妇女们也开始使用合乎卫生的月经带，生孩子时也不再到野外去了，有不少妇女还接受了新接生法。为了使这些良好的卫生习惯经常保持下去，各地人民在自觉的基础上订立了“爱国卫生检查日”和爱国卫生公约。许多工厂、矿山的工人和农村的农民除了订立爱国卫生公约以外，并将卫生工作成绩列为评比生产的标准之一。爱国卫生运动的上述收获，不仅保证了人民身体的健康，而且为大规模地开展祖国的经济建设与国防建设事业创造了重要的条件。
