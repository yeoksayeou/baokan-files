The Korean War and Armistice Negotiations
(Current Affairs Study Outline)

(I) October 25th marks the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure to fight abroad. Over the past two years, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have fought shoulder to shoulder and achieved great victories. These great victories are mainly reflected in the following three aspects:

(1) From October 25, 1950, to May 21, 1951, after five major campaigns, the American aggressors were driven back from the Yalu River all the way to the vicinity of the "38th parallel," liberating northern Korea and stabilizing the battle line near the "38th parallel."

(2) From October 25, 1950, to the end of September this year, the enemy suffered more than 630,000 casualties (killed, wounded, and captured), including more than 280,000 American aggressor troops. The total number of enemy losses is nearly twice the total number of American casualties in World War I (more than 330,000) and more than two-thirds of the total number of American casualties in World War II (more than 920,000). The losses of the U.S. military alone have approached the total number of U.S. casualties in World War I and are approaching one-third of the total number of U.S. casualties in World War II. U.S. military losses have reached slightly less than one-fifth of its current total army (approximately 1.5 million). In addition, the U.S. military has lost a large number of aircraft. From May of last year to the end of September this year, our army shot down or damaged more than 7,000 U.S. aircraft. From these figures, it can be seen how heavy the losses of the American aggressors in the Korean War were.

(3) The American aggressors' inhumane germ warfare against the Chinese and Korean people was crushed. The American aggressors originally attempted to use large-scale germ warfare to harm the Chinese and Korean people in order to salvage their battlefield failures, but this attempt by the American aggressors was also crushed.

(II) The great significance of the Korean anti-aggression war is:

(1) It shattered the American aggressors' arrogant plan to destroy Korea and defended the independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

(2) It shattered the U.S. imperialists' arrogant plan to invade our mainland via Korea, defended our country's security, and thus ensured the smooth progress and rapid completion of our national economic recovery work and various reform efforts.

(3) The war of aggression against Korea is actually an important part of the U.S. imperialists' world aggression plan. Therefore, our victory in the Korean War disrupted the U.S. imperialists' aggression deployment throughout the world.

(4) The facts on the Korean battlefield powerfully proved that U.S. imperialism must not only be defeated, but can be defeated. Thus, it punctured the American paper tiger, knocked down its prestige, encouraged all peace-loving people in the world, and strengthened their confidence and determination in the struggle. The facts on the Korean battlefield also promoted the awakening of the American people. The American people have increasingly realized that the U.S. government's aggressive policy is completely contrary to the interests of the American people and that pursuing this policy can only bring disaster to the American people, thus gradually increasing their resistance to this policy.

(5) Since U.S. imperialism has placed its main forces in Korea, and these forces are constantly suffering heavy losses, this cannot but seriously weaken its aggressive forces in other parts of the world, especially its aggressive forces in Western Europe. This has widened its contradictions in world strategy, especially the contradictions in the European and Asian strategic regions, and widened the contradictions between it and its puppet countries, especially the reactionary governments of Britain and France. At the same time, it also widened the contradictions between the American rulers and the American people.

(III) The basic situation of the Korean War at present is:

(1) The battle line has stabilized near the "38th parallel." After the Fifth Campaign in May of last year, the enemy launched so-called "summer limited offensives" and "autumn offensives" in succession, but both failed. Since then, the enemy has continued to launch attacks on our positions in an attempt to break through our army's positions, but these attacks have suffered even more tragic failures. Under the strong defense of our army, our army's positions stood firm. The only result of these "offensives" by the enemy was to continue to suffer heavy losses. Our army not only constantly shattered the enemy's offensives, but also constantly launched powerful counterattacks against the enemy, thus further strengthening our army's positions. For example, on the night of October 6th this year, our army's counterattack units occupied 21 enemy positions and annihilated more than 2,600 enemy soldiers.

(2) Our army is becoming stronger and stronger in battle. Facts have proven that our army has become an invincible and powerful army with rich experience in modern warfare and good at both offense and defense. Our army has now begun to establish a powerful artillery and air force, thus further enhancing our army's combat effectiveness. The enemy is increasingly fearful of our army's artillery fire and air defense capabilities.

(3) The enemy is becoming weaker and weaker in battle. American soldiers' will to fight has become increasingly low due to the serious failures in the Korean War and the fear of being killed in battle. In addition to continuing to carry out barbaric bombings of peaceful cities in Korea, U.S. military aircraft have been unable to prevent our army's transportation. This is a fact that the enemy, though very distressed, cannot but publicly admit.

(IV) The Korean armistice negotiations have been going on for more than fifteen months, but due to the unreasonable delays and sabotage by the U.S. side, the Korean armistice has not yet been achieved. Recently, the U.S. side has insisted on detaining our prisoners of war, unilaterally declared an indefinite recess, refused to negotiate, and suspended the negotiations, which has caused the Korean armistice negotiations to encounter new major obstacles.

(1) The American aggressors were forced to accept armistice negotiations due to their own tragic failures on the Korean battlefield. However, the U.S. government is afraid of the realization of an armistice in Korea. Therefore, since the beginning of the Korean armistice negotiations in July of last year, the U.S. delegation, under the instructions of its government, has used various shameless means to delay and sabotage the armistice negotiations. These delaying and sabotaging tactics include: (A) Raising and insisting on various unreasonable demands in the meeting, such as demanding that the demarcation line be drawn into our hinterland, forcibly occupying 12,000 square kilometers of our territory when discussing the issue of determining the military demarcation line between the two sides; demanding to send military personnel to our rear for land and air inspections after the armistice, and interfering in Korean internal affairs, restricting Korea from building airports, etc. when discussing the specific arrangements and supervision issues for realizing the armistice. (B) When these unreasonable demands were not accepted, unilaterally declaring a recess and running away from the meeting to delay and sabotage the negotiations.

(C) Constantly undermining the neutral zone agreement, such as shelling and using aircraft to invade and strafe the conference area, killing our military police in the conference area, attacking our delegation's vehicles, and attempting to threaten us with these methods. (D) Outside the meeting, constantly applying so-called "military pressure" in an attempt to force us to yield, and carrying out inhumane germ warfare, bombing the Yalu River Sup'ung Dam, indiscriminately bombing peaceful cities in Korea, and brutally massacring our captured personnel. All these actions clearly exposed the U.S. imperialists' base, shameless, and barbaric hooligan nature.

(2) Our attitude is completely opposite to that of the U.S. side. In the negotiations, we have always made the greatest efforts and patiently and sincerely sought to realize the Korean armistice. To this end, we have actively put forward various fair and reasonable proposals. It is precisely because of our persistent efforts that we broke through the U.S. side's unreasonable obstruction, so that most of the agenda of the armistice negotiations were fully agreed upon, and all 63 clauses of the draft armistice agreement were agreed upon, including the nine clauses agreement on the issue of prisoner arrangements. If it were not for the U.S. side's obstruction on the prisoner issue, the Korean armistice could have been achieved long ago.

(3) The issue of prisoners of war has been discussed for more than ten months since December of last year. On this issue, we have always followed the principles of the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War and international practice, advocating that after the armistice, both sides should release and repatriate all prisoners of war as soon as possible so that they can return home to live a peaceful life as soon as possible. According to this fair and reasonable principle put forward by our side, the prisoner of war issue could have been resolved smoothly. Even the U.S. side felt that there was no reason to oppose this principle, so that they had to agree to this principle in the draft armistice agreement. Articles 51, 52, and 54 of the draft armistice agreement clearly stipulated this. However, the U.S. side has always insisted on its absurd principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation," attempting to use this as an excuse to detain our captured personnel in large numbers and force them to serve as cannon fodder for the Li Chengwan and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs. The U.S. side's absurd claim is completely contrary to the Geneva Convention and the international practice of civilized mankind. In order to insist on this absurd claim, the U.S. side fabricated shameless lies that violated human common sense that our captured personnel "would rather commit suicide than be repatriated." But these lies have long been thoroughly exposed by a series of facts that our captured personnel bravely resisted the U.S. side's forced screening and demanded to return to the embrace of the motherland.

(4) On October 8th of this year, in order to break through the U.S. side's unreasonable obstruction, promote the armistice negotiations, and realize the armistice, our side once again put forward a new prisoner of war repatriation plan at the plenary session of the two delegations. Based on the principle of complete repatriation of prisoners of war on both sides, this plan stipulates that after the armistice agreement takes effect, all prisoners of war on both sides shall be handed over to the other party for takeover in the demilitarized zone, and then, through visits by the joint teams of the Red Cross Societies of both sides, it shall be ensured that these prisoners of war return home to live a peaceful life and no longer participate in the Korean War, and then, according to the principle of classification and repatriation by nationality and region that our side has proposed long ago, under the observation of the neutral nations inspection team: the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the United Nations forces must be completely repatriated; the Korean People's Army and the South Korean army, those whose homes are in the area of the receiving party may not be repatriated, and others must be completely repatriated. This plan of our side adopted the formal changes in the U.S. side's proposal on September 28th, which shows that our side is willing to seriously consider and adopt any reasonable elements in the other party's plan. This is a major effort by our side to promote the Korean armistice. However, the U.S. side fundamentally refused to discuss this reasonable plan of our side, and in the arrogant manner of a "take it or leave it" letter, unilaterally declared an indefinite recess, until the time when our side is willing to accept the unreasonable plan proposed by the other party on September 28th that still insists on "voluntary repatriation," that is, detaining a large number of our prisoners of war. The U.S. side's arbitrary and unreasonable actions are in sharp contrast to our side's serious attitude towards the U.S. side's plan. The Korean armistice negotiations were thus interrupted by the U.S. side's arbitrary and unreasonable unilateral action.

(5) The U.S. delegation's unilateral action to suspend the negotiations at the plenary session of the two delegations on October 8th further exposed the U.S. government's sinister conspiracy to reject peace and attempt to expand the war. The reason why this action of the U.S. side happened to occur on the eve of the convening of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly was to facilitate the U.S. government to exert pressure on other countries of the United Nations at the United Nations General Assembly, forcing them to agree to the U.S. government's plan to undermine the armistice negotiations and expand the war. The American news agency has openly disclosed this shameful plan of the U.S. government. The reason why the U.S. government is more interested in war than in peace is because it wants to continue to create tension, oppress its puppet countries to step up arms expansion and war preparations, so as to continuously increase the super profits of American arms dealers.

(V) In this situation, our attitude towards the Korean issue is very clear: we will never be intimidated by any unreasonable threats from the U.S. side, and we will never yield to the U.S. side's unreasonable demands. We will ruthlessly eliminate the aggressors who dare to invade us; at the same time, we will continue to adhere to our consistent position of peacefully resolving the Korean issue. We will continue to strive to achieve the Korean armistice on a fair and reasonable basis in accordance with international law and practice, and after the Korean armistice, we will continue to strive for the withdrawal of foreign troops in Korea in order to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. As long as the U.S. side does not dare to finally break the armistice negotiations, as long as it is still possible to continue the armistice negotiations, we will continue to insist on carrying out the armistice negotiations. Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai have sent a letter to Clark on October 16th, requesting that the U.S. side immediately stop the U.S. delegation's unreasonable action of suspending the armistice negotiations; implement the complete prisoner of war repatriation in accordance with international practice, the Geneva Convention, and the draft Korean armistice agreement already agreed upon by both sides; and quickly achieve the Korean armistice in accordance with the draft Korean armistice agreement. This is another major effort by our side to insist on continuing the armistice negotiations. What we are doing is entirely in line with the wishes and interests of all peace-loving people in the world. We will gain the support of all peace-loving people in the world in this struggle, and the U.S. government's reckless, arbitrary, and hegemonic behavior can only arouse the firm opposition of the people of the world, including the peace-loving American people, making itself even more isolated. The fact that the resolution on the Korean issue unanimously adopted by the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference attended by representatives of 37 countries recently is a vivid proof. The U.S. government's unreasonable actions to undermine the armistice negotiations have also aroused dissatisfaction from its puppet governments, further widening the contradictions between the U.S. government and them. These are the favorable conditions for us to strive for the realization of the Korean armistice and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. In order to achieve the victorious end of the Korean War and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, we must continue to vigorously support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and give the invading enemy even greater blows at any time, so as to force the U.S. government to change its policy of undermining the Korean armistice negotiations and force it to accept peace.

    朝鲜战争和停战谈判
    （时事学习提纲）
    （一）十月二十五日是中国人民志愿军出国作战两周年。两年来中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，取得了伟大的胜利。这一伟大胜利主要表现在以下三方面：
    （1）一九五○年十月二十五日至一九五一年五月二十一日，经过五次大的战役，将美国侵略者从鸭绿江边一直打退到“三八”线附近，解放了北部朝鲜，并且使战线在“三八”线附近稳定下来。
    （2）从一九五○年十月二十五日至今年九月底，毙、伤、俘敌人在六十三万人以上，其中包括美国侵略军二十八万人以上。敌人的损失总数等于第一次世界大战美军损失总数（三十三万多人）的近两倍，等于第二次世界大战美军损失总数（九十二万多人）的三分之二以上。单只美军的损失，也已接近第一次世界大战美军损失总数，并接近第二次世界大战美军损失总数的三分之一。美军的损失已达其现有全部陆军（一百五十万人左右）的五分之一稍弱。此外，美军还损失了大量飞机，自去年五月至今年九月底，我军击伤、击落的美国飞机即在七千架以上。从这些数字，就可以知道美国侵略者在朝鲜战争中的损失是多么惨重。
    （3）粉碎了美国侵略者对中朝人民所进行的灭绝人性的细菌战。美国侵略者原来企图以大规模的细菌战来危害中朝人民，以挽救其战场上的失败，但美国侵略者的这一企图结果也被粉碎了。
    （二）朝鲜反侵略战争胜利的伟大意义是：
    （1）粉碎了美国侵略者灭亡朝鲜的狂妄计划，保卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立。
    （2）粉碎了美帝国主义企图经由朝鲜进攻我国大陆的狂妄计划，保卫了我国的安全，从而保障了我们国家经济恢复工作和各项改革工作的顺利进行和迅速完成。
    （3）侵朝战争实际上是美帝国主义世界侵略计划的一个重要组成部分，因此，我们在朝鲜战争中的胜利，就打乱了美帝国主义在全世界的侵略部署。
    （4）朝鲜战场上的事实有力地证明了：美帝国主义不但必须打败，而且是可以打败的。因而戳穿了美国纸老虎，打落了它的威风，鼓舞了全世界一切爱好和平的人民，增强了他们斗争的信心和决心。朝鲜战场上的事实也促进了美国人民的觉悟，美国人民已日益认识到美国政府的侵略政策是完全违背美国人民的利益的，执行这种政策只能给美国人民带来灾难，因而使美国人民逐渐增强了对这一政策的反抗。
    （5）美帝国主义既然把它的主要力量放在朝鲜，并且这一力量不断地遭受重大损失，这就不能不严重地削弱了它在世界上其他地区的侵略力量，特别西欧的侵略力量。这样就扩大了它在世界战略上的矛盾，特别是欧亚两个战略地区的矛盾，并且扩大了它和其仆从国家之间的矛盾，特别是和英国、法国反动政府的矛盾，同时，也扩大美国统治者和美国人民之间的矛盾。
    （三）目前朝鲜战争的基本形势是：
    （1）战线已在“三八”线附近稳定下来。在去年五月第五次战役以后，敌人曾接连发动了所谓“夏季有限攻势”和“秋季攻势”，但都遭到失败。此后，敌人仍不断向我阵地发动进攻，企图突破我军阵地，但这些进攻遭到更加悲惨的失败。在我军的坚强防守下，我军阵地屹立不动。敌人的这些“攻势”唯一的结果只是使它自己继续遭到重大的损失。我军不但不断地粉碎了敌人的进犯，而且不断地对敌人进行了强有力的反击，因而进一步加强了我军的阵地。例如今年十月六日一夜间，我军反击部队即占领敌军阵地二十一处，并歼敌两千六百多名。
    （2）我军已愈战愈强。事实证明，我军已成为有了现代化作战的丰富经验的既善于攻又善于守的一支不可战胜的强大的军队。我军现在已开始建立起强大的炮兵和空军，因而进一步增强了我军的战斗力。敌人已日益对我军的炮火和防空力量感到畏惧。
    （3）敌人愈战愈弱。美军士兵因为侵朝战争的严重失败和惧怕战死，作战意志已愈来愈益低落。美军飞机除了继续对朝鲜和平城市进行野蛮的滥炸以外，已无力阻止我军的运输。这是敌人虽然十分苦恼但却不能不公开承认的事实。
    （四）朝鲜停战谈判已进行了十五个多月，但由于美方的无理拖延和破坏，朝鲜停战直到现在仍未能实现。最近更由于美方坚持扣留我方战俘，片面宣布无限期休会，拒绝协商，中止谈判，已使朝鲜停战谈判遭遇到新的重大障碍。
    （1）美国侵略者由于自己在朝鲜战场上的悲惨失败，才被迫接受了停战谈判。但是美国政府是害怕对朝鲜停战的实现的。因此，从去年七月朝鲜停战谈判开始以来，美方代表团即在其政府指示下，用各种无耻的手段拖延和破坏停战谈判。这些拖延和破坏手段包括：（甲）在会中提出和坚持各种无理要求，如在讨论确定双方军事分界线的问题时，要求将分界线划入我方腹地，强占我方一万二千方公里土地；在讨论实现停战的具体安排和监督问题时，要求在停战后派遣军事人员对我方后方进行陆上和空中的视察，并干涉朝鲜内政，限制朝鲜修筑飞机场等。（乙）在这些无理要求不被接受时，即片面宣布休会和实行逃会，以拖延和破坏谈判。
    （丙）不断破坏中立区协议，如炮轰和用飞机侵犯、扫射会场区，杀害会场区我方军事警察，袭击我方代表团车辆，企图用这些办法威胁我方。（丁）在会外，不断施用所谓“军事压力”，企图压迫我方屈服，并进行灭绝人性的细菌战，轰炸鸭绿江水丰发电站，滥炸朝鲜和平城市，野蛮屠杀我方被俘人员等。所有这些行动，都清楚地暴露了美国帝国主义者的卑劣、无耻和野蛮的流氓本性。
    （2）我方的态度则和美方完全相反。我方在谈判中始终以最大的努力和耐心诚意谋求朝鲜停战的实现。为此，我方曾积极地提出各种公平合理的建议。正是由于我方的坚持努力，才打破了美方的无理阻挠，使停战谈判的绝大部分议程都获得了完全协议，并使全文六十三款的停战协定草案全部达成协议，其中包括关于俘虏安排问题的九款协定。如果不是美方在俘虏问题上横加阻挠，朝鲜停战早就可以实现。
    （3）战俘问题从去年十二月开始讨论，到现在已十个多月了。我方在这一问题上始终遵照一九四九年日内瓦战俘待遇公约的原则和国际惯例，主张在停战后双方将收容的全部战俘尽速予以释放和遣返，以便他们能早日回家过和平生活。按照我方所提出的这一公平合理的原则，战俘问题本可顺利解决。甚至美方也觉得没有理由对此原则加以反对，以致不得不在停战协定草案中同意这一原则。停战协定草案第五十一款、第五十二款和第五十四款即明确作了这样的规定。但美方始终坚持其所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则，企图以此为藉口大批扣留我方被俘人员，强使他们充当李承晚和蒋介石匪帮的炮灰。美方这一荒谬主张是完全违反日内瓦公约和文明人类的国际惯例的。美方为了坚持这一荒谬主张，捏造出我方被俘人员“宁愿自杀也不愿遣返”的违反人类常识的荒唐无稽的无耻谰言。但这些谎言也早已为我方被俘人员英勇反抗美方强迫甄别和要求返回祖国怀抱的一连串事实所彻底揭穿了。
    （4）今年十月八日，我方为了打破美方的无理阻挠，推进停战谈判，以实现停战，在双方代表团大会上又一次提出了一个遣俘新方案。这个方案根据全部遣返双方战俘的原则，规定：在停战协定生效后，双方全部战俘一律送至非军事区内交给对方加以接管，然后经由双方红十字会联合小组的访问，保证这些战俘回家过和平生活，不再参加朝鲜战争，然后再根据我方早已提出的按照国籍、地区分类的原则，在中立国视察小组观察之下，进行分类和遣返，即：中国人民志愿军和联合国军的被俘人员，必须全部遣返；朝鲜人民军和南朝鲜军，家在收容一方地区者可不必遣返，其他则必须全部遣返。我方这一方案采取了九月二十八日美方提案中形式方面的变动，这表示我方对对方方案中的任何一点合理成分都愿加以郑重考虑和采纳。这是我方对于促成朝鲜停战的重大努力。但美方对我方这一合理的方案根本拒绝讨论，并以哀的美顿书的狂妄方式，片面宣布无限期休会，一直到我方愿接受对方九月二十八日所提出的仍然坚持“自愿遣返”即扣留我方大批战俘的无理方案的时间为止。美方这种蛮横无理的行动和我方对待美方方案的郑重态度正成一鲜明对照。朝鲜停战谈判就这样被美方蛮横无理的片面行动所中断了。
    （5）美方代表团在十月八日双方代表团大会上的中止谈判的片面行动，进一步暴露了美国政府拒绝和平和企图扩大战争的恶毒阴谋。美方这一行动之所以恰恰发生在联合国第七届大会召开的前夜，就是为了便于美国政府在联合国大会上对联合国其他国家施用压力，强使他们同意美国政府破坏停战谈判和扩大战争的计划。美国的通讯社已公开披露了美国政府的这一可耻的计划。美国政府之所以对战争比对和平更有兴趣，就是因为它要借此继续制造紧张局势，压迫其仆从国家加紧扩军备战，以便不断增加美国的军火商的超额利润。
    （五）在这种情势下，我们对朝鲜问题的态度是很明白的：我们绝不会为美方的任何无理威胁所吓倒，绝不在美方的无理要求下屈服，我们将无情地消灭胆敢向我们进犯的侵略者；同时，我们将继续坚守我们所一贯遵循的和平解决朝鲜问题的立场。我们将继续力谋按照国际公法和惯例、在公平合理的基础上实现朝鲜停战，并在朝鲜停战后继续为撤退在朝鲜的外国军队，以实现朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗。只要美方还不敢最后破裂停战谈判，只要继续停战谈判还有可能，我们就要继续坚持进行停战谈判。金日成、彭德怀两将军已于十月十六日致函克拉克，要求：美方立即停止美方代表团中止停战谈判的无理行动；根据国际惯例、日内瓦公约及双方已达成协议的朝鲜停战协定草案实行全部遣俘；并根据朝鲜停战协定草案，迅速实现朝鲜停战。这是我方为坚持继续进行停战谈判的又一重大努力。我们这样做，是完全符合于全世界一切爱好和平的人民的愿望和利益的。我们在这一斗争中将获得全世界一切爱好和平的人民的支持，而美国政府穷凶极恶、独断横行的结果，只能引起世界人民，包括爱好和平的美国人民的坚决反对，使它自己更加陷于孤立。最近由三十七个国家的代表参加的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议所一致通过的关于朝鲜问题的决议的事实，就是生动的证明。美国政府破坏停战谈判的无理行动，也已经引起它的仆从国家政府的不满，更加扩大了美国政府和他们之间的矛盾。这些就是我们为争取实现朝鲜停战、争取朝鲜问题的和平解决的有利条件。为着达到朝鲜战争的胜利结束和朝鲜问题的和平解决，我们必须继续大力支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，随时给予进犯的敌人以更大的打击，借以迫使美国政府改变破坏朝鲜停战谈判的政策，迫使它接受和平。
