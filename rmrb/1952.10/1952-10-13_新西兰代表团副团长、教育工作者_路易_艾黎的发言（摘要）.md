I would like to say a few words to supplement the opinions everyone has expressed:

The first point is about the close connection between the forces of war-making throughout the world. When I came to China twenty-five years ago, I heard the phrase "the white man's burden." At that time, this phrase was very popular in the West, and it was used to cover up the rampant imperialist actions in China and other colonial countries. At that time, the coast of China was teeming with adventurers from all over the world, who brought unbelievable arrogance and contempt for all true human values. They had conspiracies to completely conquer and carve up the whole of China. There were privilege seekers, spies, and political police. There was also widespread poverty and disease. People from many parts of the world made fortunes. Millions of good Chinese people died.

Today, China has been liberated from the control of foreign exploiters and their puppets. In this organized and healthy society, it is almost unbelievable to look back at those evil forces that once held power. Those tycoons who lived very lavishly, the smugglers who peddled arms and opium, and the profiteering arms merchants all fled abroad with their henchmen and accomplices.

We remember the American adventurer Chennault, who transported guns and ammunition to the northwest of China for the warlords, allowing them to use these to fight against the People's Liberation Army. The Ma generals transported several carloads of explosives and sent a thousand soldiers to destroy the training school where I used to work, trying to wipe out all the faculty, staff, and students. At the last moment, the People's Liberation Army saved us. Chennault took his fleet of Kuomintang planes, bought by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and given to him by Chiang Kai-shek, and went off to do other things. They assisted in breaking the New Zealand dockworkers' strike. Today, they are transporting guns to the Kuomintang troops in Burma and transporting Kuomintang officials from Taiwan to Korea.

It is good for peace fighters to recognize these enemies of peace and warn their own people to be vigilant against these enemies.

The second point I want to talk about is the ability of ordinary people to fight for peace. During the terrible days of the Anti-Japanese War, under the incompetent rule of the Kuomintang, widespread famine occurred in Henan Province, China. Many homeless and hungry children became orphans. Some of the children were taken in by a cooperative training school, and I watched them become skilled technicians and capable administrators. In all the qualities that a great person should possess, they were no less than anyone else. They are people who can use their minds to fight for peace.

These are just a small part of the hundreds of millions of such people who have been ravaged and despised by reactionary forces in the past. Today, it is people like these who are using their constructive power to create the destiny of China's 500 million people and radiate new hope to all the oppressed people of the world.

The last point I want to emphasize is the international nature of the struggle for peace. The peace enjoyed by this new world is not easily won.

On that solemn and great day of October 1st, when I stood on the reviewing stand and looked around, seeing representatives from so many different countries watching the scene in front of them with such tension and joy, I couldn't help but think of Canada's Bethune, India's Kotnis, America's Smedley, and Britain's Hogg, and how they were not able to live to see this day of peace, which was part of their ideal, even though their bones are buried in Chinese soil. These people have the same internationalist spirit as today's true peace fighters.

Peace will spread everywhere, spreading into everyone's heart. Peace is the foundation of all constructive life, and no matter how many difficulties there are, the road to peace can never be cut off.

### 新西兰代表团副团长、教育工作者  路易·艾黎的发言（摘要）

    路易·艾黎的发言（摘要）
    我愿意说几点，来补充大家所讲过的意见：
    第一点是关于全世界那些制造战争的力量相互间的密切关连。当我二十五年前来到中国的时候，我曾听到过“白种人的负担”这句话。当时在西方这句话是很流行的，它被用来掩饰那时在中国以及其他殖民地国家内非常猖狂的帝国主义的行动。当时中国的沿海蜂拥着来自世界各地的冒险家，他们带来了难以相信的骄横和对一切人类真正价值的轻视。他们曾有过完全征服整个中国和瓜分中国的阴谋。这里有猎取特权的人们、特务和政治警察。这里也有普遍的贫穷和疾病。由世界上许多地方来的人发了财。千百万善良的中国人民死亡了。
    今天，中国已经从外国剥削者和他们的傀儡的控制下解放了出来，在这个有组织的健全的社会里，回顾那些过去曾经一度当权的恶势力，真使人有些难以置信。那些生活非常阔绰的大班们，贩卖军火鸦片的走私客，混水捞鱼致富的军火商人，他们都同他们的打手帮凶一齐逃到外国去了。
    我们记得那位美国冒险家陈纳德，他替军阀们把枪炮和军火运到中国的西北，让他们用这些东西去和人民解放军作战。马家将军们运了几车炸药并派了一千名兵士去破坏我以前工作的那所训练学校，想把教职员工和学生一网打尽。在最后关头，人民解放军救了我们。陈纳德带着他那队由联合国善后救济总署买来、而由蒋介石送给他的国民党飞机，又跑去干别的勾当了。他们协助破坏了新西兰码头工人的罢工。今天，他们在替缅甸境内的国民党军队运送枪炮，并且把国民党官员们从台湾运到朝鲜。
    让和平战士们认清这些和平的敌人，并且警告他们本国人民对这些敌人提高警惕，是有好处的。
    我想讲的第二点是关于普通人民争取和平斗争的能力。在抗日战争的恐怖日子里，在无能的国民党统治之下，中国河南省普遍发生饥荒。许多没有衣服、饥饿无食的流浪儿童变成了孤儿。有些孩子被一个合作社训练学校所收容，我眼看着他们成为熟练的技术人员、能干的行政管理者，在伟大的人所应具备的一切品质上，他们与任何人相比都是毫无逊色的。他们是能够开动脑筋为和平而奋斗的人。
    这些不过是亿万这种人民的一小部分而已，他们过去都曾遭受过反动势力的蹂躏和蔑视。今天，就是像这样的人在用他们的建设性的力量创造着中国五亿人民的命运，并且向全世界一切被压迫的人民放射出新的希望的光芒。
    我要强调的最后一点是争取和平斗争的国际性。这个新的世界所享受的和平并不是很容易地获得的。
    在庄严伟大的十月一日那一天，当我站在观礼台上向四面环视，看到来自那么多不同的国家的代表们正是那样紧张、那样高兴地注视着眼前的景象的时候。我不得不想起了加拿大的白求恩、印度的攷尼斯、美国的史沫特莱、英国的霍葛，想到他们竟没有能够活着看到这个曾是他们的理想的一部分的和平的日子，虽然他们的骨骸是埋葬在中国的土地上的。他们这些人是和今天的真正的和平战士们一样具有国际主义精神的。
    和平是会到处散布，散布到每一个人的心中去的。和平是一切建设性的生活的基础，不管有多少困难，走向和平的路是永远无法切断的。                                            （新华社）
