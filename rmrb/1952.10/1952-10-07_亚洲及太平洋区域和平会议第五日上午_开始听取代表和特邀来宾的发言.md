Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The fifth day of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference continued on the morning of the 6th at 9:30 AM.

The executive chairmen of the morning session were: Suloto (Indonesia), Antonio Cruz Franco (Guatemala), Carlos Berteiski (Panama), Zeng Xuehong (Malaya), Manuel Cruz (Philippines).

Under the direction of the executive chairman, Suloto, head of the Indonesian delegation, the conference began to hear speeches from the delegates.

The morning session heard speeches from seven delegates and one special guest from various countries and international democratic organizations. They were citizens of Turkey, Italy, Mongolia, Austria, Canada, Britain, and Belgium; their professions included poet, educator, lawyer, women's worker, and peace activist. There were men and women, middle-aged people, and older people. They spoke in various languages and viewed the issues from various angles. However, they were all talking about the same thing: the people of their countries, the countries of Asia and the Pacific, and the people of the world all unanimously demanded peace and opposed war. From various angles, they exposed the bloody crimes committed by the American government and the British and French governments in Korea, Malaya, and Vietnam, as well as the brutal devastation that these governments' frantic arms race policies inflicted on the national independence, freedoms, and living standards of the people of various countries. They unanimously demanded an immediate end to the Korean War, an end to the wars against the people of Vietnam and Malaya, a ban on barbaric weapons of mass slaughter, the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, and lasting peace and happiness for the peoples of the world.

First to speak was Hikmet, the world-renowned Turkish poet and outstanding peace fighter. As he walked to the podium, he was greeted by a standing ovation and thunderous applause.

Hikmet said: All peoples should be able to enjoy peace according to their own wishes and live their lives in the way they like best. However, the sons of the Turkish people are forced to wear American uniforms and are sent across mountains and oceans to Korea to be murderers. He said that when the Turkish government decided to send troops to Korea, Turkish peace fighters declared it an act of betraying the motherland and a crime against national independence. He then pointed out that as a result of Marshallization, Turkey has been turned into an American military base and colony. Therefore, the Turkish people have closely linked the struggle for peace with the struggle for national independence. After describing the heroic struggles of the Turkish people in various aspects, Hikmet said that the government uses arrests and death sentences to suppress the peace movement, but it has not intimidated the Turkish people. He passionately pointed out that the Turkish people know that not only countries that do not want to turn other countries into their colonies can support peace, but also countries that have just won freedom and independence also support peace. Therefore, the Turkish people regard the Soviet Union as the most solid fortress of world peace and the People's Republic of China as a signal that inspires hope in the struggle for peace. He said: This venue looks like a garden of peace and friendship in my eyes, with flowers of various colors blooming together. The whole world can become such a garden, and it will definitely become such a garden. The poet and peace fighter's passionate language aroused thunderous applause.

At Hikmet's suggestion, all attendees stood in silence for one minute to pay their highest respects to the heroes who sacrificed for peace and national independence around the world. Santi (Italy), Deputy Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the International Democratic Women's Federation, then spoke. She saluted the conference on behalf of the International Democratic Women's Federation. Santi said: Today, the greatest crime against humanity is being committed in Asia. Bacteriological warfare has begun to attack Korea and China, and children are most susceptible to infection. We are horrified when we think about the unfolding of this disaster. If it were not for the tireless efforts of the Chinese and Korean people to prevent the spread of bacteria, this disaster would spread to all mankind. Santi then described the plight of women and people in the capitalist world, saying: We are facing a mad arms race, aggressive agreements, the occupation of foreign troops, and children being taken away from their mothers. The heavy burden of full-scale preparations for war falls on the people and even threatens their survival. She pointed out that women and mothers are the enemies of war because they account for half of humanity, and they represent a great force in the struggle for peace. Moreover, the number of women participating in the peace movement is constantly increasing, and their anxiety has turned into active struggle. Santi then detailed the struggles of the International Democratic Women's Federation and women from various countries to defend peace and protect the rights of women and children. She said: The International Democratic Women's Federation has issued a call to women all over the world, asking them to support the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. We must demand disarmament, we must demand the prohibition of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. We must prevent the revival of German and Japanese militarism. A peace pact must be concluded. The will of women, coupled with the will of hundreds of millions of people, will become an invincible force for defending peace! Santi's speech was followed by continuous applause.

Next, the head of the Mongolian delegation, Chairman of the Mongolian Peace Protection Committee, and President of Choibalsan University, Xilindibu, spoke. Xilindibu emphasized condemning the U.S. military's violation of international conventions in Korea, carrying out indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities and towns, and massacring prisoners. He also pointed out that Japanese militarism had attacked Mongolia, the Soviet Union, and other countries, and that the United States is now actively reviving Japanese militarism. The danger of American aggression is becoming increasingly serious for Beijing, Ulaanbaatar, Sydney, Delhi, and other cities. Xilindibu also explained in detail the glorious achievements that the Mongolian people have made in the thirty years since gaining national independence, as well as the fraternal friendship between Mongolia and the Soviet Union and China. Finally, he put forward proposals such as immediately ending the Korean War, banning bacteriological weapons, and concluding a Five-Power Peace Pact, which were unanimously endorsed.

Subsequently, Brandweiner, a fearless peace fighter from Austria, took the stage to speak. He said: As the head of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team on bacteriological warfare, and as a professor of international law and a member of the World Peace Council, I have the right to protest the unprecedented violations of international law by the American military and political leaders. In my own country, people have tried to stop me from speaking by force, but they have not succeeded. Brandweiner emphasized that whoever resists aggression is on the side of justice. I believe that the efforts of the glorious Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea today contribute more to peace than many other things. Brandweiner concluded by saying: I wish the heroic Korean people would end their struggle in such a way that lasting peace would be realized not only in Asia but also throughout the world. The Austrian peace fighter's brief but persuasive speech resonated with the entire audience.

Canadian delegate, Vice Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, Sanderson then spoke. She described in detail the Canadian people's desire for peace and their struggle to defend peace. She pointed out that there is no doubt that the vast majority of the Canadian people want peace and do not approve of the massacres being carried out in Korea. However, the Canadian people have been blinded by the propaganda instigated by the American government and newspapers. Organized peace movements have been subjected to particularly vicious attacks. However, the situation is beginning to change. People across the country have been greatly agitated. The declaration calling for the Five Powers to conclude a peace pact has achieved considerable success in Canada. The Canadian people demand an immediate ceasefire in Korea. In our country, there is a very deep friendship and goodwill towards the Chinese people and the entire Asian people. The Canadian people want to live in peace and maintain friendly relations with the Asian people and the people of all countries in the world. This sentence was met with continuous applause from the audience.

After a break, the conference continued at 11:30 AM. The executive chairman was Antonio Cruz Franco, head of the Guatemalan delegation, Chairman of the Guatemalan Peace Committee, and former Justice of the Supreme Court.

Montagu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Peace Council and British peace fighter, began to speak to enthusiastic applause. Standing from the perspective of a British patriot, he condemned the British army's four years of cruel war against the people of Malaya. He began by listing a series of inhuman crimes committed by the British army in Malaya. Montagu pointed out that although the British Empire had mobilized a large armed force for suppression, the people of Malaya had not been intimidated by it. The long-term struggle of the Malayan patriotic men and women is bearing fruit. Montagu said that it is the responsibility of every British citizen to do their best to end this war. Montagu concluded by calling on everyone to stop the Korean War and all other hostilities. We must achieve the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact so that the peaceful coexistence of all nations can be guaranteed, and all nations can freely enjoy their own way of life. The conference responded to Montagu's call with enthusiastic applause.

After Montagu's speech, Zeng Xuehong, the representative of the Malayan people, walked over and shook hands firmly with the representative of the British people.

The conference gave great honor to Mrs. Felton, the winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize, who began her speech amidst enthusiastic applause from the audience. This famous British female peace fighter, who participated in the investigation team of the International Democratic Women's Federation in 1951 to investigate the atrocities of the U.S.-Lee forces in Korea, revealed the brutal crimes of the U.S. aggressor troops in Korea when talking about her recent impressions of visiting Korea again. She said: Korea has changed. Its changes are two-fold: First, the insane material destruction has reached an even more appalling level. Some people have already seen articles describing the situation in Korean cities and villages in 1951, but now, the old ruins have been broken down into new shapes. Throughout Pyongyang, no building, large or small, has four walls and a roof left. No urban area can escape barbaric bombing. When talking about the second change, she said: Everyone who visited Korea in 1951 will be repeatedly moved by the heroism of the people. But today, this courage has been added a new quality: the quality of composure. Despite the constant bombing by enemy planes, life in Korea today not only still exists but is also moving forward. In the countryside, there is a bumper harvest of rice and other grains. Even in Pyongyang, people are living a new life underground—where production, work, and even cultural activities can be carried out. Once such facts are known to everyone, it will be an example to the world. All these things show the noblest courage, showing that people with this courage not only believe that they have a future, but also believe that the whole of mankind has a future. We must remember that the future of Korea is our future. The hope there is also the hope of all mankind.

Mrs. Felton continued: The Korean War has been going on for too long. Now is the time for the people of all countries around the world to take action. What are we, the people who have come to participate in this conference, going to do? I cannot answer this question better than the British and American prisoners of war in Korea. These people did not expect to receive humane and friendly treatment from the Chinese People's Volunteers. They cannot speak for themselves, but their concern for striving for peace is profound and sincere, because they have had the painful experience of war, and they have not only experienced the consequences of war for themselves, but also experienced the consequences of war for the Korean people they were sent to kill. They asked me to say: "Tell the Peace Conference, tell the world—our desire to strive for peace is much deeper than our own desire to return home."

Mrs. Felton finally emphasized: I have told you the truth, but the truth must be stated again and again until the conscience of the people of the world is awakened. This task is urgent. Let us make a guarantee today to work with greater strength. Mrs. Felton's speech was frequently interrupted by thunderous applause.

Mrs. Bufio, a lawyer from the Belgian Court of Appeal and representative of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, then spoke. In her speech, she discussed the responsibility of legal workers in the struggle to defend peace. She said: This conference is being held at a critical moment for the safety of mankind, and every item on the agenda has legal content, indicating that legal workers bear a special responsibility. Mrs. Bufio then pointed out that the struggle to maintain peace is also a struggle to respect international law. Since World War II, international law has undergone special development, accusing any act of aggression. The responsibility of legal workers is to point out at any time that those who prepare for war have violated international treaties and to awaken the attention of the people of all countries so that men and women of all countries demand that their governments adhere to their promises. Mrs. Bufio emphasized that preparing for war will immediately lead to restrictions on human rights and fundamental human freedoms. Legal workers should respect all these freedoms and defend those who defend peace who are persecuted by their own governments. This is the central task of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers. Finally, Mrs. Bufio saluted the conference on behalf of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and congratulated the conference on its success. Her words were warmly welcomed by the participants.

Finally, Deputy Secretary-General Louis Hueton read out congratulatory telegrams from the Chinese People's Volunteers, British Reverend Johnson, American California peace activists, the Chilean General Confederation of Labor, the Bulgarian National Peace Committee, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and the All-China Youth Federation. The audience welcomed these congratulatory telegrams with enthusiastic applause. When Hueton had just announced that the conference had received a congratulatory telegram from the Chinese People's Volunteers, the audience stood up and applauded thunderously, fully expressing the high respect of all peace fighters in this vast region of Asia and the Pacific and the whole world for this heroic army that fights to defend peace in the Far East and the world.

The morning session adjourned after reading out the congratulatory telegrams.

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第五日上午
    开始听取代表和特邀来宾的发言
    【新华社六日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第五日会议在六日上午九时三十分继续举行。
    上午会议的执行主席是：苏洛多（印尼），安东尼奥·克鲁斯·弗兰哥（危地马拉），卡罗·柏特里斯基（巴拿马），曾雪虹（马来亚），马纽尔·柯鲁兹（菲律宾）。
    会议在执行主席、印尼代表团团长苏洛多的主持下，开始听取代表们的发言。
    上午会议一共听取了来自各个国家、国际民主组织的七位代表和一位特邀来宾的发言。他们的国籍有土耳其、意大利、蒙古、奥地利、加拿大、英国和比利时，他们的职业有诗人、教育家、律师、妇女工作者与和平运动者，他们当中有男人，有妇女，有中年人，也有老年人，他们在发言时讲着各种不同的语言，而且从各种不同的角度看问题。但是，他们所谈的却是同样一件事：他们国家的人民、亚洲及太平洋各国以及全世界的人民，都一致要求和平，反对战争。他们从各种不同的角度揭露美国政府和英国、法国政府在朝鲜、马来亚、越南所犯的血腥罪行，以及这些政府疯狂备战政策对各国人民的民族独立、自由权利与生活水平的横暴的摧残。他们一致要求立即停止朝鲜战争、停止对越南和马来亚人民的战争，要求禁用大规模屠杀的野蛮武器，要求缔结五大国和平公约，要求全世界的持久和平与各国人民的幸福生活。
    首先登台发言的是世界闻名的土耳其名诗人、杰出的和平战士希克梅特。他走向讲台时，就受到全场起立和暴风雨般掌声的欢迎。
    希克梅特说：各国人民应该可以按照他们自己的愿望享受和平并按照他们最喜欢的方式过生活。但是，土耳其人民的子弟却被迫穿上美国制服，被送过丛山和海洋到朝鲜去做杀人犯。他说：当土耳其政府决定派军队到朝鲜去的时候，土耳其和平战士就宣布这是背叛祖国的行为，是反对民族独立的罪犯。他接着指出：由于马歇尔化的结果，土耳其已被变为美国的军事基地和殖民地，因此，土耳其人民把和平斗争与民族独立的斗争紧紧地结合在一起。希克梅特在叙述了土耳其人民在各方面的英勇斗争之后说：政府以逮捕和死刑来镇压和平运动，但并没有吓倒土耳其人民。他热情地指出，土耳其人民知道：不仅那些不想把别国变成自己的殖民地的国家才能拥护和平，而且那些刚刚赢得了自由和独立的国家也是拥护和平的。因此，土耳其人民把苏联当做世界和平的最坚固的堡垒，而把中华人民共和国当作和平斗争中鼓舞人们的希望的信号。他说：这个会场在我的眼前好像是一个和平与友谊的花园，各种颜色的花朵一齐怒放。整个世界能够变成这样一个花园，也一定会变成这样的一个花园。这位诗人兼和平战士的热情洋溢的语言，引起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    在希克梅特的提议下，全体到会者起立静默一分钟，向全世界为了和平、为了民族独立而牺牲的英雄们表示崇高的敬意。国际民主妇女联合会书记处副总书记桑蒂（意大利）接着发言。她代表国际民主妇女联合会向大会致敬。桑蒂说：今天，侵犯人类的最大罪恶正在亚洲进行着。细菌战已经开始攻击朝鲜和中国，而儿童们最易感染疫疠。当我们想到这种灾祸已经展开时，我们感到心悸神惊。假如不是中朝人民作了不倦的努力来阻止细菌传播，那么，这种灾祸就会扩大到全人类。桑蒂接着描述资本主义世界的妇女和人民的困境说：我们面对着的是疯狂的扩军备战、侵略性的协定、外国军队的侵占、孩子被从母亲那里夺去。全部备战的沉重负担却落在人民的身上，甚至威胁他们的生存。她指出：妇女、母亲是战争的敌人，因为她们占全人类的半数，她们在为和平的斗争中代表着一个伟大的力量。而且参加和平运动的妇女正在不断增加，她们的焦虑变成了积极的斗争。桑蒂接着详述了国际民主妇联和各国妇女为保卫和平、保卫妇女和儿童权利而斗争的情况。她说：国际民主妇联向全世界妇女发出了号召，请她们支持亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。我们必须要求裁减军备，必须要求禁止原子武器、细菌武器及其他大规模毁灭性的武器。我们一定要阻止德国和日本的军国主义复活。和平公约一定要缔结。妇女的意志，加上亿万人的意志一定会变成不可战胜的保卫和平的力量！桑蒂发言毕，全场掌声不断。
    接着，蒙古代表团团长、蒙古保卫和平委员会主席、乔巴山大学校长锡林迪布发言。锡林迪布着重地谴责美军在朝鲜破坏国际公约，施行滥炸和平城乡、屠杀俘虏的暴行。他又指出：日本军国主义曾经进攻过蒙古、苏联及其他国家，而美国现在又积极复活日本军国主义，美国侵略的危险，对于北京、乌兰巴托、雪黎、德里和其他城市，是越来越严重了。锡林迪布并详细说明蒙古人民取得民族独立后的三十年所得到的光辉成就，以及蒙古与苏中两国的兄弟友谊。他最后提出了立即停止朝鲜战争、禁用细菌武器、缔结五大国和平公约等项建议，得到全体一致拥护。
    随后，奥地利的一个无畏的和平战士布兰德魏纳上台讲话。他说：作为国际民主法律工作者协会细菌战调查团的团长，同时作为一个国际公法的教授和世界和平理事会理事，我有权利向美国的军事政治首领们空前的违反国际公法的罪行提出抗议。在我自己的国家里，人们曾经企图用武力来阻止我说话，但他们没有成功。布兰德魏纳强调指出：谁反抗侵略，谁就是有公理的。我相信：光荣的中国人民志愿军今天在朝鲜所做的努力比许多别的事情更有助于和平。布兰德魏纳最后说：我愿英雄的朝鲜人民这样来终结他们的斗争，使得持久和平从此不仅在亚洲实现，而且也在全世界实现。这位奥地利和平战士简短的然而有巨大说服力的讲演，引起了全场的共鸣。
    加拿大代表、加拿大和平大会副主席桑德逊接着发言。她详细地叙述了加拿大人民的和平愿望和保卫和平的斗争。她指出：毫无疑问，绝大多数的加拿大人民是要求和平，不赞成在朝鲜所进行的屠杀的。然而，加拿大人民一直受到美国政府和报纸所唆使的宣传的蒙蔽。有组织的和平运动特别受到恶毒的攻击。但是，形势正在开始变化。全国各地的人民已大为激动起来。要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言已在加拿大获得相当大的成就。加拿大人民要求立刻在朝鲜实现停战。在我国，对中国人民以及整个亚洲的人民有着极深厚的友谊和善意。加拿大人民要求生活在和平之中，并和亚洲人民以及全世界各国人民维持友好的关系。她这句话获得了全场不断的掌声。
    会议在休息后，于十一时三十分继续进行。执行主席是危地马拉代表团团长、危地马拉和平委员会主席、前最高法院法官安东尼奥·克鲁斯·弗兰哥。
    世界和平理事会书记处书记、英国和平战士蒙塔古在热烈掌声中开始发言。他站在一个英国爱国者的立场，谴责英国军队对马来亚人民进行了四年的残酷战争。他一开始就列举了英国军队在马来亚所犯下的一连串违反人道的罪行。蒙塔古指出：虽然大英帝国调动了很大的武装力量进行镇压，可是，马来亚人民并没有因此而被吓倒。马来亚爱国志士的长期斗争正在获得成果。蒙塔古说：我们每一个英国公民的责任就是要尽最大的努力来结束这个战争。蒙塔古最后号召说：我们必须争取每一个人都来制止朝鲜战争及其他一切敌对行为。我们必须做到缔结五大国和平公约，这样，就可以保证所有民族的和平共存、各民族可以自由地享受自己的生活方式。大会以热烈的掌声响应了蒙塔古的号召。
    蒙塔古发言后，马来亚人民的代表曾雪虹走过去和这位英国人民的代表紧紧地握手。
    会场以很大的光荣给予斯大林国际和平奖金得奖人费尔顿夫人，她在全场热烈的掌声中开始演说。这位在一九五一年曾参加国际民主妇女联合会调查团到朝鲜调查过美李军暴行的英国著名的女和平战士，在谈到她最近再度访问朝鲜的印象时，揭发了美国侵略军在朝鲜的残暴罪行。她说：朝鲜已经改变了。它的改变有两方面，第一是疯狂的物质毁灭到了越发可怖的程度。有些人已经看到一些文章描述朝鲜的城市与乡村在一九五一年的情况，但是现在，旧的废墟已破毁得成为新的样子了。整个平壤，不论大小房子，没有一幢还剩下四堵墙和屋顶。没有一个市区逃脱得了野蛮的轰炸。她在谈到第二种变化时说：凡是在一九五一年访问过朝鲜的人都要再三地被人民的英勇所感动。但在今天，这种勇敢已经加上了一种新的品质：镇定的品质。尽管敌机在不断地轰炸，今天在朝鲜的生活不仅依旧存在，并且在向前迈进着。在乡间有着稻米和其他谷物的丰收。就是在平壤，人们在地下过着新的生活——在那里生产工作甚至文化活动都能够进行。这样的事实被大家知道以后，对全世界将是一个榜样。所有这些事情都表示了最高贵的勇敢，表示了有这种勇敢的人们，不但相信他们自己有前途，并且相信全人类有前途。我们必须记住朝鲜的前途就是我们的前途。那里的希望也是全人类的希望。
    费尔顿夫人接着说：朝鲜战争已进行得太久了。现在，时候到了，全世界各国人民该行动起来了。我们来参加这次会议的人将要怎么办呢？我回答这个问题比不上朝鲜的英美战俘回答得更好。这些人想不到受到了中国人民志愿军人道的、友好的待遇，他们不能自己来发言，但他们对争取和平的关怀是深切而真诚的，因为他们有了战争的惨痛经验，不仅体会到战争曾给他们带来什么后果，而且体会到战争对于他们被派去杀害的朝鲜人民会有什么后果。他们要求我说：“告诉和平会议，告诉全世界——我们争取和平的愿望比我们自己要回国的愿望还深切得多。”
    费尔顿夫人最后强调说：我已经把真相告诉你们，但是真相必须一再说明，直到唤醒了全世界人民的良心。这个任务是紧迫的。让我们今天提出保证，要用更大的力量来工作。费尔顿夫人的演说频频为雷动的掌声所打断。
    国际民主法律工作者协会代表、比利时上诉法院律师布非郁夫人接着发言。她在发言中论述了法律工作者在保卫和平斗争中的责任。她说：这次会议是在人类安危所系的关头召开的，议程的每一项都具有法律的内容，说明了法律工作者身上负有特殊的责任。布非郁夫人接着指出：维护和平的斗争也就是尊重国际法的斗争。自从第二次世界大战以来，国际法有了特别的发展，它指责任何侵略行为。法律工作者的责任就是要随时指出备战的人违犯了国际条约，并唤起各国人民的注意，以便各国男女要求他们本国政府坚守信约。布非郁夫人强调指出：准备战争会立刻引起对于人权及人类基本自由的限制。法律工作者应该尊重所有这些自由，卫护受到本国政府迫害的保卫和平的人士。这就是国际民主法律工作者协会的中心任务。布非郁夫人最后代表国际民主法律工作者协会向大会致敬，并祝贺大会获得成功。她的话受到与会者的热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    最后，副秘书长路易士·惠吞宣读了中国人民志愿军、英国的约翰逊教长、美国加利福尼亚和平工作者、智利总工会、保加利亚全国和平委员会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主青年联合总会的贺电。全场以热烈的鼓掌欢迎这些贺电。当惠吞刚刚宣布大会收到中国人民志愿军的贺电时，全场起立，掌声雷动，充分表示了亚洲及太平洋这个广大地区以及全世界的一切和平战士们，对于这支为保卫远东与世界和平而战的英雄部队的崇高敬意。
    上午会议在宣读贺电后休会。
