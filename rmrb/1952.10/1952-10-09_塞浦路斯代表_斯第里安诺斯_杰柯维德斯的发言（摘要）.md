The meeting is very important for the people of the Asian and Pacific regions. Considering that the Regional Peace Conference decided by the World Peace Council to be held in the Near East and Middle East has not yet been realized, this meeting is particularly important for the people of the Near East and Middle East. War vendors are constantly and rapidly establishing military bases in the Near East and Middle East countries. According to reports on the peace movement in the Near East and Middle East countries, this is indeed a very obvious fact.

Cyprus is an island in the Eastern Mediterranean with a population of about 500,000. Since 1878, Cyprus has been under the rule of British imperialism. But from the first day of British rule in Cyprus, the people of Cyprus have resolutely and desperately demanded freedom.

British imperialism immediately began establishing military bases on our island after the war. Americans had also come to our island long ago and established their military bases. They also attempted to establish the headquarters of the so-called "Middle East Command" – an expanded part of the Atlantic Treaty – in Cyprus.

Based on these facts, it can undoubtedly be seen that British and American imperialism is preparing to launch a war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, using Cyprus as a military base in this war of aggression.

The people of Cyprus do not regard the struggle for national independence and the struggle for peace as two separate things. The people of Cyprus understand very well that these two things are inseparable.

Since 1950, Cyprus has launched a mass movement for peace, which has been supported by all progressive organizations and many intellectuals and scientists. From that year on, we began to organize an All-Cyprus Peace Committee, regional peace committees, and peace committees in various towns and many villages in Cyprus. Since then, the struggle for peace has intensified. In August 1950, the US Navy fleet entered Famagusta Harbor. The peace movement organized an anti-war mass rally and march that was prohibited by law. The reaction of our people was so strong that the US fleet left the harbor two days earlier than the officially announced date of stay.

Despite the pressure exerted on us by the Cypriot government and its reactionary groups, our peace movement still collected 87,000 signatures in the Stockholm Appeal movement and 103,000 signatures in the movement for the conclusion of a peace pact, which is about half of the adult Greek population of Cyprus. Currently, a signature campaign against the establishment of military bases is underway in Cyprus. As of September 15, when I left Cyprus, 101,000 signatures had been collected.

The peace movement in Cyprus is developing day by day, and the struggle against the establishment of military bases and for national freedom is also becoming increasingly acute. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate on behalf of the people of Cyprus that we will never allow ourselves to become cannon fodder for imperialism against the Soviet Union, against New China, or against any people in the world. We will continue to fight at any cost for the abolition of military installations on our island and for national freedom.

The peace movement in Cyprus, the people of Cyprus, fully recognize the great importance of this meeting. There is no doubt that after we return home, we will further develop our struggle for peace, national freedom, and independence.

Now allow me to make the following proposals:

(1) We all know that imperialism wants to use the Middle East and Near East region as a huge war base for their war of aggression. Therefore, I suggest that the peace movements in the Middle East and Near East countries must establish contact and cooperate with each other to fight against imperialism and war bases.

(2) The peace movements in these countries have a very serious problem, which is that the governments of these countries brutally suppress the peace movements with force. I think the peace movements of all other countries must help our movement so that our people can obtain political rights and human rights, and obtain national freedom and independence.

### 塞浦路斯代表  斯第里安诺斯·杰柯维德斯的发言（摘要）

    塞浦路斯代表
    斯第里安诺斯·杰柯维德斯的发言（摘要）
    这次会议对于亚洲及太平洋区域的各国人民说来，是非常重要的。想到世界和平理事会决定在近东和中东召开的区域和平会议至今没有实行，这次会议对于近东和中东的人民就尤其重要了。战争贩子们正在近东和中东国家不断地、加速地建立军事基地，根据有关近东和中东国家和平运动的报告看来，这确实是很明显的一件事实。
    塞浦路斯是东地中海的一个岛，大约有五十万人口。自一八七八年起，塞浦路斯就受着英帝国主义的统治。但是从英国统治塞浦路斯的第一天起，塞浦路斯的人民就坚决地、不顾一切地要求自由。
    英帝国主义在战后立即开始在我们的岛上建立军事基地。美国人也早已到我们岛上来，建立了他们的军事基地。他们并企图将所谓“中东司令部”——大西洋公约的扩大部分——的大本营，也设在塞浦路斯。
    根据这些事实，就可无疑地看出英美帝国主义正准备着向苏联和人民民主国家发动战争，拿塞浦路斯作为这个侵略战争中的一个军事基地。
    塞浦路斯人民并没有将争取民族独立的斗争和争取和平的斗争看作两件事。塞浦路斯人民非常明白这两件事是分不开的。
    自一九五○年起，塞浦路斯展开了一个群众性的争取和平运动，这个运动受到了所有进步组织和许多知识分子和科学家的支持。从那一年起，我们开始组织一个全塞浦路斯和平委员会，区和平委员会和塞浦路斯各城镇和许多乡村中的和平委员会。从那时起，争取和平的斗争是加紧了。一九五○年八月，美国海军舰队开进法马古斯太海港。和平运动组织了一个为法律所禁止的反战群众大会和游行。我们人民的反应是那么地强烈，使美国舰队比正式宣布停留的日期早两天离开海港。
    尽管塞浦路斯政府和其反动集团对我们施加压力，我们和平运动在斯德哥尔摩宣言运动中仍征集了八万七千个签名，在为缔结和平公约的运动中征集了十万零三千个签名，这大约等于塞浦路斯的希腊成年人口的半数。现在，在塞浦路斯正进行着一个反对建立军事基地的签名运动，截至九月十五日我离开塞浦路斯时为止，已征集了十万零一千个签名。
    塞浦路斯的和平运动正在日益发展着，反对建立军事基地和争取民族自由的斗争也日益尖锐起来。我要趁这个机会代表塞浦路斯的人民再次宣布，我们绝不让自己成为帝国主义反对苏联、反对新中国或世界上任何人民的炮灰。我们将不惜任何牺牲，继续为废除我们岛上的军事设备和争取民族自由而战斗。
    塞浦路斯的和平运动，塞浦路斯的人民充分认识到这个会议的极大重要性。不容怀疑，在我们回国以后，我们都要更进一步发展我们争取和平与民族自由及独立的斗争。
    现在请允许我提出如下的提议：
    （一）我们都知道帝国主义要利用中东和近东这个区域作为他们侵略战争的巨大战争基地，因此我建议中东和近东国家的和平运动必须取得联系并互相配合，来为反对帝国主义、反对战争基地而斗争。
    （二）这些国家的和平运动有一个非常严重的问题，就是这些国家的政府以残酷的武力来镇压和平运动，我想所有其他国家的和平运动都必须来帮助我们的运动，使我们的人民能得到政治权利和人权，得到民族自由和独立。（新华社）
