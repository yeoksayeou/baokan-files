    In order to assist elementary school teachers in their studies and work, and to improve their political, cultural, and professional水平 (shuǐpíng - level), the Central Ministry of Education has published the monthly journal "Elementary School Teacher." In addition to explaining the New Democratic education guidelines and policies, introducing excellent teaching experiences from China and the Soviet Union, and answering difficult questions, the journal also includes columns such as Current Affairs Knowledge, Educational Essays, and Language Ramblings to help elementary school teachers learn about current events, study educational theory, and improve their cultural level. It will also organize discussions on ideological issues from time to time to raise teachers' Marxist-Leninist level.

The main articles in this issue include: an inaugural message, teaching experiences,心得 (xīndé - insights) from teacher training, and questions and answers regarding teachers' ideological problems in implementing the five-year consistent system.
