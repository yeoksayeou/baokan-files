How to Prevent Frost Damage
    Yang Jianchu

    Editor's Note: In China, crops in North China, Northeast China, and other regions are often damaged by frost, leading to reduced harvests. This article provides a relatively systematic explanation of the causes of frost damage and methods for preventing it. This is helpful for preventing frost damage, protecting crops and fruit trees, and even mastering agricultural seasons. Therefore, we are publishing it here for reference.

    How Frost Forms

    The first frosts of autumn often damage crops, so it's important to take precautions beforehand.

    Frost occurs when the near-surface temperature drops below 0 degrees Celsius. Below 0 degrees, even if the air contains too little moisture and no frost forms, crops can still be damaged by freezing; this is commonly referred to as "freezing damage."

    Based on weather conditions, we can divide frost into two categories: The first is caused by the movement of cold air. After autumn begins, cold air from the north sometimes has a temperature below 0 degrees; frost damage will occur wherever this cold air flows. If the force of the cold air is very strong, it is called a "cold wave." The frost caused by a "cold wave" lasts longer, and the frost damage is more severe. The second category is caused by the ground radiating heat at night, which lowers the air temperature below 0 degrees. This type of frost often occurs on clear, calm nights. This frost damage can sometimes be very fierce, because the temperature is relatively high during the day, and it cools down especially quickly at night. The temperature changes greatly within a day, and crops are more likely to be damaged after frost occurs. These two types of frost cannot be completely separated. If there are consecutive days of strong northerly winds (cold wave), which are unusually cold, once it clears up and the wind dies down, the effect of ground radiation at night often causes very serious frost.

    Although weather conditions are the main cause of frost formation, ground conditions also have a great influence on the occurrence of frost and the severity of frost damage:

    (1) Cold air is relatively heavy and easily accumulates in low-lying areas; these areas are particularly likely to experience frost, and the degree of frost damage is also severe. In areas with uneven terrain and slopes, cold air sinks down the slopes at night and accumulates in lowlands or valleys. Therefore, the frost layer is thicker in lowlands and valleys, and the temperature on the upper slopes is often higher. Therefore, cold-sensitive crops are not suitable for planting in low-lying areas. To prevent cold air from sinking down slopes, plant more trees on the slopes, or set up a fence on the mid-slope. (2) The nature of the soil and ground conditions have a great relationship with the speed of heat dissipation, and therefore also with the possibility of frost formation and the severity of frost damage. If the soil has a good heat transfer function, it can obtain more heat from the lower soil layer to supplement the heat lost from the ground due to radiation, so that the ground temperature does not drop too quickly at night, and the degree of frost damage will be lighter. The looser the soil, the more air it contains, the smaller its heat transfer capacity; moreover, when there is a lot of air in the soil, there are also many pores, which strengthens the radiation effect of heat dissipation, which will cause the temperature to drop faster. Plants can weaken the heat dissipation caused by radiation at night. The taller and denser the plants, the higher the ground temperature below them at night. In addition, when the moisture content of the soil increases, its heat transfer capacity also increases. (3) The amount of water vapor contained in the air, as well as cloud cover, wind direction, etc., are also related to frost. In areas with relatively dry air, little cloud cover, and sheltered from the wind, the radiation heat dissipation effect is strong at night, the temperature is likely to drop, and frost damage is also heavier.

    How to Prevent Frost Damage

    In order to prevent frost damage, frost forecasting is very important. Frost forecasting is basically forecasting the minimum near-surface temperature. Ground temperature is greatly affected by local conditions, so the effective range of general forecasts cannot be very wide. If meteorological stations have forecasting work, they should combine weather changes with some local factors and issue frost forecasts to local farmers through the local government at any time. However, there are very few stations with forecasting work, and it is actually difficult to universally issue frost forecasts. If farmers' production organizations can set up some simple temperature observation equipment and have a preliminary understanding of the causes of frost formation, they can solve this problem themselves.

    Mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives in rural areas can jointly buy a simple thermometer from a stationery store in the city. Take it back and hang it in the north-facing window; in early autumn and late spring, check it once every night around 9 o'clock. If the temperature drops to around 5 degrees Celsius, and there are no clouds in the sky (or very few clouds), the starlight is very bright, and the wind is also very small, there will generally be frost that night. If there is a strong northerly wind during the day, and it clears up in the evening and the wind weakens, the possibility of frost is even greater.

    The dates of the first frost and last frost vary from place to place in China. Generally speaking, the further north you go, the earlier the first frost comes in autumn, and the later the last frost goes in spring, which means the longer the frost period and the shorter the crop growing season (frost-free period). Guangdong, Guangxi, the Sichuan Basin, and the low valleys of southern Yunnan are rarely hit by frost even in winter, due to their southern location or special terrain. The average first frost date, last frost date, earliest and latest first frost date, and last frost date for some important locations in China are listed below for reference:

    There are two types of methods for preventing frost damage: One is to try to reduce the heat dissipation of the ground in the farmland, which can be done by smoke smudging and shielding. The other is the heating method, which uses artificial heating to raise the temperature of the planting surface. The second type of method is often more expensive, and is generally not suitable for large-scale application except for valuable agricultural products.

    (1) Smoke Smudging: In the fields where crops are planted, burn slightly moist fuel to produce thick smoke. This combustion makes the increase in air temperature negligible, but the smoke generated spreads over the crops, which can reduce ground heat dissipation, and the near-surface temperature does not drop excessively. In late autumn and early spring, you can pile up small piles of weeds, sorghum stalks, etc. in the fields to burn smoke when frost is forecast. These weeds, sorghum stalks, etc. used for burning smoke cannot be too dry, as they will easily burn out if they are too dry, and will not produce much smoke, and will not last all night. But they cannot be too wet, as they will not burn if they are too wet. The more piles there are, the better. When it is estimated that there is a possibility of frost at night, you can light them, and let the thick smoke cover the crops, so that frost damage can be prevented, or at least the degree of frost damage can be reduced. This method can also be used in orchards, and is the simplest and easiest method to implement.

    (2) Shielding: Cover the crops with reeds, mats, or waste paper at night to slow down the ground temperature dissipation, which can also prevent frost. At the same time, reeds and other materials can be woven into fences and erected row by row on the north side of the crop fields. This can not only block the cold air flow from the north, but also allow the crops to receive more reflected sunlight during the day, which is also very effective for frost prevention. In order to prevent crops in low-lying areas from being damaged by frost, some low earthen walls can be built on the four sides of the hillside to prevent cold air from converging downwards. This method can be used simultaneously with the smoke smudging method.

    (3) Wrapping: Wrapping plants thickly with reeds, waste paper, or rags can also prevent freezing damage. This method can only be used for fruit trees and the like.

    (4) Irrigation: Irrigating the field and burying the plants, even the tops, in the water can also prevent frost damage. Because water has a large specific heat, the temperature of the water drops slowly. Even if the near-surface temperature is very low, only a thin layer of ice will form on the water surface, and the crops buried in the water will not be damaged by frost. However, this method can only be used for seedlings of crops that are not afraid of water.

    怎样预防霜害
    杨鉴初
    编者按：我国华北、东北及其他某些地区的农作物，经常遭受霜害，以致歉收。本文对霜害的成因、预防霜害的办法，都有比较系统的说明，这对预防霜害、保护作物、果木，以至对掌握农事季节都有帮助，所以我们把它发表在这里，供各地参考。
    霜是怎样来的
    秋天的初霜常会损害农作物，应在事前注意预防。
    近地面温度低到摄氏温度表零度以下时，就会发生霜。在零度以下时，即使空气里含水太少，并没有发生霜，也能冻坏作物，这就是平常所说的“冻害”。
    拿天气情况来做标准，我们可以把霜分为两类：第一类是由于冷空气的流动而产生的。入秋以后，北方来的冷空气的温度有时会低于零度；这种冷空气流过的地方就会发生霜害。如果冷空气流的势力很强大，就叫做“寒潮”。“寒潮”所产生的霜，停留的时间较长，霜害就更加严重。第二类是由于地面夜里放散热量，使空气温度冷下来低于零度而产生的。这一类的霜常常发生在天气晴朗、风也很小的夜里。这种霜害有时很凶恶；因为白天温度比较高，夜里冷得特别快，一天之内温度变化很大，发生了霜以后，作物更容易遭受损坏。这两类霜不是可以完全分开的。如果连天刮大北风（寒潮），阴冷异常；一旦晴了，风也息了，到了夜里，再加上地面散热的影响，就往往造成很严重的霜。
    天气情况虽然是霜生成的主要原因，但是地面状况对于霜的发生和霜害的轻重也有很大的关系：
    （一）冷空气比较重，容易停积在低洼的地方；这种地方发生霜的可能性就特别大，霜害的程度也重。地势高低不平而有斜坡的地方，夜里冷空气就沿斜坡下沉，积在低地或者谷底。因此，在低地谷底霜层较厚；在斜坡上面的温度常常反而比较高些。所以，怕冷的作物不适宜种植在低洼的地方。要防备斜坡上冷空气下沉，可以在坡上多种树木，或者在半坡上设一道篱墙。（二）土壤的性质和地面情况对于散热的快慢有很大关系，因此也同成霜的可能和霜害的轻重有关。如果土壤传热的作用比较好，那么可以从土壤下层取得较多的热量来补充地面因辐射作用而散失的热量，使得地面的温度在夜里不至于下降得太快，霜害的程度也就会较轻。土壤越松，所含的空气越多，它的传热能力越小；而且土壤中空气多时，空隙也多，散热的辐射作用就强，会使温度下降加快。植物能够减弱夜里因辐射而散热的作用。植物越高越密，在它下面的地面夜里温度也越高。此外，土壤中所含的水分增多时，它的传热的能力也就增强。（三）空气中所包含的水气分量以及云量、风向等，和霜也有关系。在空气比较干燥、云量很少、而且背风的地方，夜里辐射散热作用强烈，温度容易低落，霜害也就较重。
    怎样预防霜害
    为了防止霜害，霜情预报是很重要的。霜情预报，基本上就是预报近地面最低温度。地面温度受局部的影响很大，所以一般预报的有效范围不可能很广。气象台站如果有预报工作的话，应该结合天气变化和一些地方因素，随时通过地方政府向当地农民发出霜情预报。但是，有预报工作的台站很有限，要求普遍地发布霜情预报事实上有困难。如果农民的生产组织能设置一些简单的温度观测设备，同时对于霜的生成的原因有了初步了解，就可以自己来解决这样一个问题。
    农村里的互助组或农业生产合作社可以合伙到城里的文具店里，买一支简单的温度表。拿回去悬空挂在朝北的窗口；秋初春末，每天晚上九点钟左右，去看它一次。如果温度低到摄氏五度附近，而且天空里没有云（或者有云也很少），星光很明朗，同时风也很小，这天夜里一般都会有霜。假使白天有阵大北风，到晚上转晴了，风转小了，有霜的可能性就更大。
    我国各地初霜、终霜出现的日期早迟不一。一般而论，越到北方秋天初霜来得越早，春天晚霜去得越迟，也就是霜期越长，作物生长期（无霜期）越短。广东、广西和四川盆地以及云南南部低谷，因为靠南或地形特殊的缘故，就是在冬季，也难得看见一次霜。现在把国内一些重要地点的平均初霜日、终霜日，最早和最晚的初霜日期、终霜日期列表于后，供各地参考：地点平均初霜日期  最早初霜日期  平均终霜日期  最晚终霜日期满洲里九月十四日  八月二十六日五月廿一日六月九日沈  阳十月三日  九月十五日  五月二日  五月十八日北  京十月十五日  十月四日  四月四日  四月廿五日兰  州十月二十日  十月十五日  四月二日  四月三十日太  原十月六日  十月三日  四月十四日四月三十日开  封十一月六日  十月二十五日三月廿八日四月五日济  南十月三十一日九月二十五日三月十九日四月十九日南  京十一月十一日十月二十五日三月十八日四月六日汉  口十二月七日  十一月六日  二月廿三日三月廿五日长  沙十二月五日  十一月廿八日三月二日  三月十二日成  都十二月十一日十二月五日  二月六日  三月十三日昆  明十一月廿六日十一月七日  二月廿三日三月十八日
    预防霜害的方法有两类：一类是设法减少庄稼地里地面的散热作用，可以用熏烟法和遮蔽法等等。另一类是加热法，用人工加热，使种植地面的温度升高。第二类方法往往所费较多，除开对于贵重的农产品而外，一般不适宜于大量应用。
    （一）熏烟法：在种植作物的田地里，燃烧略带潮湿的燃料，发出浓厚的烟雾。这种燃烧使空气温度的增高是微不足道的，但生成的烟雾散布在作物之上，却能使地面散热作用减少，近地面温度不过分低降。在秋末春初的时候，可以在田地里用一些杂草、高粱秆等，到处堆上一些小堆堆，以备预报有霜的时候燃烟用。这些作燃烟用的杂草、高粱秆等不能太干，太干了容易烧掉，燃不出许多烟来，而且经不了一夜，但也不能太湿，太湿了会燃不着。这些堆堆堆得越多越好。估计夜里有发生霜的可能时，就可以把它们点着，让浓烟把庄稼笼罩起来，霜害便能防止，至少也可以减轻霜害的程度。这个办法果树园也可以用，是最简便最容易实行的办法。
    （二）遮蔽法：夜里用芦苇、帘席或者废纸等等盖在庄稼上，地面温度散发得可以慢些，也能够防霜。同时可用芦苇等材料编织成篱笆，一行行地屏立在庄稼地的北面，这样既可以阻止北方来的冷气流，而且可以使庄稼在白天多受到些反射下来的阳光，这对防霜也很有效。为了防止低洼地方的作物遭受霜害，可以在四面半山坡上打起一些矮土墙，阻止冷空气向下汇集。这种方法可以和熏烟法同时采用。
    （三）包扎法：用芦草、废纸或破布厚厚地包扎植物，也能防止冻害。这种方法只能用于果树之类。
    （四）灌水法：灌水到田圃中去，把植物连顶都埋没在水里，也能防止霜害。因为水的比热很大，水里的温度下降缓慢，即使近地面温度很低时，也不过在水面上结一层薄冰而已，埋在水里的作物便可以不受霜害。但这种方法只能用于不怕水的作物的幼苗。
