    A Beautiful, Modernized Factory
    ——A Visit to the Northeast Harbin Flax Mill
    By Our Correspondent Chen Ji

    Entering the Harbin Flax Mill, one sees beautiful buildings everywhere. Gleaming asphalt roads and neat stone block roads run parallel through the factory gate, like two ribbons fastening the factory to the streets of Harbin. Rows of light gray office buildings stand like walls, protecting the factory buildings. Ten of the fifty three-story vermilion workers' dormitories have already been completed. A large canteen accommodating seven hundred people, a spacious cultural palace, barber shop, tailor shop, laundry, hospital, and cooperative will also appear in the verdant workers' village. In a 67,000-square-meter area of the workers' village, various flowers, plants, and trees will be planted, and fountains, rockeries, and sports fields will be built.

    The flax mill is not only a beautiful factory, but also a highly modernized one. When you stand in the factory building and see the high-speed machines equipped with automatic devices, you can't help but exclaim in praise.

    I once visited the weaving branch factory and stood beside the warping machine. More than four hundred warp yarns flashed before my eyes. Suddenly, the machine stopped, and a red light came on. I thought the machine had malfunctioned. The worker operating the machine calmly said, "This indicates that a yarn has broken." As he spoke, he calmly rejoined the broken yarn, and the machine started again. This automatic device clearly reduces the workers' intense labor and completely guarantees the quality of the products. This branch also has automatically controlled winding machines and weft winding machines: after many bobbins are filled with yarn, they automatically fall into the boxes under the machine; many empty bobbins also automatically return to their original positions to continue winding yarn.

    In the hackling branch, there are several rectangular hackling machines. Two female workers stand in front of the hackling machine. One worker deftly feeds bundles of messy flax into the machine. The machine automatically sends it to many steel needles of different densities. The steel needles quickly comb the flax evenly, and then the machine's ingenious device turns the combed flax over, separates the long and short fibers, and neatly delivers it to another female worker at the other end of the hackling machine. Thus, the hackling work is completed.

    In the processing branch, several giant combined machines are flashing. I walked around the bleaching combined machine and saw only four workers in the middle of this seventy-meter-long bleaching combined machine, which is composed of twenty-five machines. They walked back and forth, watching the machines just like the visitors. I asked them what they were doing. They said they were checking the machines. A worker sat on a stool beside the machine, watching an electrical switch machine. This is the person who controls all the machines. He told me that he could control the machine with the push of a button. This machine can bleach more than three thousand meters of light blue linen into snow-white color in one hour. Not far from this bleaching combined machine, there is a giant impregnation combined machine, which can turn more than one thousand two hundred meters of bleached cloth into various colored linen, water dragon cloth, rainproof cloth, canvas, etc., in one hour.

    When you visit the Harbin Flax Mill, you will definitely ask, "How did we build this beautiful and highly modernized factory in such a short period?" I want to tell you with excitement: this is mainly due to the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts. They tirelessly collected comprehensive design data for us, made correct designs, and personally guided our construction on the cold North Manchurian grasslands; the machines used in the factory are also new Soviet-made machines. It is these Soviet people and experts cultivated by Stalin who, with a high degree of internationalism, helped us build this factory.

    On July 1, 1950—this great day—Soviet experts arrived in Harbin, and construction of the flax mill began. Before construction, Soviet experts had already completed the design. Before the design, Soviet experts comprehensively collected design data. They dug dozens of wells, each more than ten meters deep, on the construction site of the flax mill, took out the soil from the wells, and carefully tested the soil's pressure resistance. Once, when they were surveying the construction site, they discovered an error. They were as nervous as if they had discovered an enemy, and kept saying, "No mistakes! No mistakes!" They measured three times in the scorching sun to confirm the accuracy of the survey data. When understanding the data of groundwater, Soviet experts and Chinese workers sat beside the well and personally tested the nature of the water. They did not leave the site until they understood the true source of the water. They investigated and studied the forms of Chinese architecture and tried their best to adopt Chinese national forms in the design. They also visited many textile factories in the Northeast, studied the operating conditions and technical level of Chinese workers, and investigated the eating, entertainment, housing, and bathing habits of Chinese workers. Their spirit of attaching importance to investigation and research is extremely touching. In the process of investigating and designing data, they also paid attention to the data needed for construction and production. When determining the overall distribution of the factory, they not only estimated the possibility of the factory's development, but also considered the conditions of raw material supply and product sales; they not only took care of municipal construction, but also paid attention to the beauty of the factory's layout. Therefore, the plan layout of the flax mill is a highly ideological plan and a beautiful picture. Soviet experts' serious and comprehensive collection of design data has laid a successful foundation for a correct factory design.

    The design of the flax mill is the most correct design. In the flax mill, using the design of Soviet experts, there was no phenomenon of frequent changes in design due to incorrect design, nor was there any constant rework due to design errors. Construction worker Zhao Yunfeng and Yang Chun had participated in the construction of many projects in the past. They used to be troubled by errors caused by construction according to design drawings. This time they were extremely happy. They said: "The instructions of the design drawings of Soviet experts are very detailed and clear. There are no errors in construction according to the design drawings."

    Compared with general construction, in the same kind of project, the design of Soviet experts always embodies the principle of economy more. The reason is that the design of Soviet experts is accurate and the calculation is thorough, so the safety factor is extremely small, and the potential capacity of the equipment is fully utilized. At the same time, Soviet experts also pay attention to "using local materials" and often use substitutes to replace expensive materials. For example, the factory needs to use lead pipes, but because the price of lead is too high, Soviet experts use cement to replace lead. Initially, some technicians expressed doubts. Soviet experts patiently explained the scientific basis for using cement and pointed out: "As engineers of the people, we should find ways to save national assets in many ways." Soviet experts also tried to improve the utilization rate of the unit area of ​​buildings. Every building in the flax mill has exerted its effectiveness, and there is no unnecessary space.

    In the design of Soviet experts, the care for the labor safety, welfare, and health of workers is meticulous. In every factory building, on every machine, and in all places where accidents may occur, there is safety equipment. All gears are fitted with covers; all electric rollers are equipped with iron railings. Even the color of the factory buildings and machines is designed to prevent workers' eyes from being irritated. The machines in the hackling branch are yellow, and the walls of the hackling branch are also yellow. The color of the painted walls in the spinning branch varies with the color of the spinning wheels. This harmonious color will not irritate the workers' eyes. The ventilation and ventilation device in the flax mill is also very good. There is a kind of ventilation pipe that can extract the hemp chips and dust that fly out after the machine is started out of the factory, so that workers will not breathe in these dirty things. There is also a kind of ventilation and ventilation pipe that can exhaust the turbid air in the factory and bring in fresh air; it can adjust the temperature in the factory and keep it always warm. When you walk into the factory building, you will feel that it is always spring, always morning.

    I walked through several branches, and I found that the floors I walked on were very soft. This is a special chemical floor. Soviet experts considered that the cement floor is too hard and too humid, and it is uncomfortable to work on it for eight hours and is prone to arthritis, so they changed to this chemical floor. Near each branch, there is a "living room". In the
    "living room", there are changing rooms, shift rooms, bathrooms, canteens, etc. When workers go to work and get off work, they can eat, bathe, rest, and change clothes in this "living room". These modern designs have brought infinite happiness and joy to the workers.

    Anyone who has visited the flax mill knows that the project quality of the flax mill is the best. This is because Soviet experts paid special attention to quality when guiding construction. Soviet experts often told us: not paying attention to quality is tantamount to destroying national property. Therefore, people working in the flax mill put quality first. In order to ensure quality, Soviet experts also require that every project must be done in accordance with operating procedures. Violating operating procedures is violating laws and regulations. When using materials, the quality of the materials must also be tested. Because of this, the project quality is completely guaranteed.

    The process of building the flax mill is a process of learning advanced Soviet experience. In the construction process, Soviet experts taught Chinese workers to master advanced bricklaying methods, implement winter construction and prefabricated construction. During the construction of the factory, Soviet experts also taught Chinese workers how to operate new machines. There is a technical school in the flax mill. The technical school has models of all production processes. After get off work, workers can go to the technical school to study. Soviet experts guide workers here to learn technical theory and conduct practical experiments. We can predict that in the near future, the flax mill will cultivate batches of excellent workers with technical theory.

    Every machine, every house, and every building in the flax mill is the crystallization of the fraternal friendship between the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union, and a brilliant symbol of the great Soviet people's selfless assistance to the Chinese people. I visited the flax mill, and I felt that the Soviet Union's assistance is an important condition for us to embark on the road to happiness. (Attached pictures)

    一座美丽的近代化的工厂
    ——访问东北哈尔滨亚麻厂
    本报记者  陈迹
    走进哈尔滨亚麻厂，到处都是一座座美丽的建筑。光亮的柏油路和齐整的石块路平行地通过工厂的大门，像两条带子把工厂和哈尔滨的市街扣在一起。一座座淡灰色的办公室的楼房，如同围墙一样地卫护着厂房。五十幢朱红色的三层楼的工人宿舍，已经有十座落成了。容纳七百人的大食堂，宽阔的文化宫、理发室、裁缝店、洗衣房、医院、合作社，也将在碧绿的工人村里出现。在一片六万七千平方公尺的工人村的地方，将要种植各种花草树木，将要修建喷水池、假山和运动场。
    亚麻厂不仅是一座美丽的工厂，而且是一座高度近代化的工厂。当你站在厂房里，看见那装有自动设备的高速度的机器时，你会不自主地发出赞扬的声音。
    我曾经参观织布分厂，站立在这个分厂的整经机的旁边，四百多根经纱从我眼前闪过。忽然机器停止了转动，一盏红灯亮了，我以为机器出了毛病。操纵这台机器的工人平静地说：“这表示一根纱断了。”他说着，从容地把断纱接好，机器又转动起来。这种自动的装置显然地减轻了工人的紧张的劳动，而且完全地保证了产品质量。这个分厂还有自动装置的络纱机和络纬机：很多纬管绕满了纱之后，就自动地落在机器下的盒子里；很多空的纬管也自动地跑到原来安纬管的地方，继续绕纱。
    在梳麻分厂里，放着几台长方型的梳麻机。两个女工站在梳麻机的前面，一个女工敏捷地把成捆的乱七八糟的亚麻送进机器内，机器自动地把它送到许多不同密度的钢针中，钢针飞快地把亚麻梳得匀匀的，然后机器的巧妙的装置又把梳好的亚麻颠倒过来，把长短纤维分开，从梳麻机的另一端很整齐地送到另一个女工手里。这样，梳麻的工作就完成了。
    在加工分厂，几台巨大的联合机在闪动，我围着漂布联合机走了一圈，才看见四个工人在这台七十公尺长的，由二十五部机器组成的漂布联合机的中间，他们走来走去，和参观的人一样地注视着机器。我问他们在做什么，他们说在检查机器。在机器旁的小凳子上，坐着一个工人，正看着一台电气开关机，这就是操纵全部机器的人。他告诉我他凭着电钮就可以操纵这台机器。这台机器在一小时内可以把三千多公尺长的淡青色的亚麻布，漂成雪白的颜色。在这台漂布联合机不远的地方，有着一台巨长的浸渍联合机，它可以在一小时内把一千二百多公尺的漂白布，变成各种色样的麻布、水龙布、防雨布、帆布等。
    当你参观了哈尔滨亚麻厂，你一定会问：“在短短期间内我们是怎样建成了这座美丽和高度近代化的工厂呢？”我要带着激动的心情告诉你：这主要是因为苏联专家热情的帮助。他们不知疲倦地给我们搜集了全面的设计资料，做出正确的设计，并亲自在严寒的北满草地上指导我们施工；工厂所用的机器，也是苏联制造的新型机器。就是这些斯大林培养出来的苏联人民和专家，他们以高度的国际主义精神帮助我们建成了这座工厂。
    在一九五零年七月一日——这个伟大的日子里，苏联专家到了哈尔滨，亚麻厂开始动工。动工前，苏联专家已做好设计。在设计前，苏联专家全面地搜集了设计资料。他们在亚麻厂的工地上，挖了几十个深达十多公尺的井，从井内取出土壤，细心试验土壤的耐压力。有一次，他们测量工地情况时，发现了错误，他们如同发现敌人似地紧张，连说：“错不得！错不得！”在火炽似的阳光里，测量了三次，才肯定了测量资料的正确性。在了解地下水的资料时，苏联专家和中国工人坐在井旁，亲自化验水的性质，没有弄清水源的真实情况以前，他们不离开现场。他们调查和研究了中国建筑的形式，并在设计中尽量地采用了中国民族的形式。他们还参观了东北很多纺织厂，研究了中国工人的操作情况和技术程度，调查了中国工人吃饭、娱乐、住房和洗澡的习惯。他们这种重视调查研究的精神，感人极深。他们在调查设计资料的过程中，也注意了施工方面和生产方面所需要的资料。在确定整个工厂分布的状况时，不仅估计到工厂的发展的可能，而且考虑到原料供给和产品销路的条件；不仅照顾了市政的建设，而且注意了全厂布置的美观。因之亚麻厂的平面布置图，就是一张有高度思想性的方案图和美丽的图画。苏联专家这样认真地全面地搜集设计资料，就给一个正确的工厂设计带来了成功的基础。
    亚麻厂的设计是最正确的设计。在亚麻厂，运用苏联专家的设计，没有发生因为设计不正确而常常变更设计的现象，也没有发生因为设计错误而不断反工的事情。施工员赵云峰、杨春过去参加过很多工程的修建，曾经因为按照设计图施工发生错误而常常感到苦恼，这一次他们高兴极了。他们说：“苏联专家的设计图的说明，又详细又清楚，照着设计图施工，不出错误。”
    和一般的建筑相比较，在同一种工程中，苏联专家的设计，总是更多地体现了节约的原则。原因是苏联专家的设计准确、计算周密，因而安全系数极小，充分利用了设备的潜在能力。同时，苏联专家还注意“就地取材”，常常以代用品来代替价格高昂的材料。例如工厂中要用铅管，由于铅的价格太高，苏联专家就以洋灰来替代铅。最初，有些技术人员表示怀疑，苏联专家耐心解释了用洋灰的科学根据，并且指出：“作为人民的工程师，应该多方面设法节省国家资财。”苏联专家还尽量提高建筑物的单位面积的利用率。亚麻厂的每个建筑都发挥了它的效能，没有什么不必要的空间。
    在苏联专家的设计中，对工人的劳动安全、福利卫生的关怀，是无微不至的。在每个厂房里，在每台机器上，在一切可能发生事故的地方，都有安全的装备。所有的齿轮都装有罩子；所有的电滚都设了铁栏。甚至厂房和机器的颜色，都尽量注意到使工人的眼睛不受刺激。梳麻分厂的机器是黄色，梳麻分厂的墙壁也是黄色。纺纱分厂的油漆的墙壁的颜色，是随着纺车颜色的不同而不同。这种调和的色彩，是不会刺激工人的眼睛的。亚麻厂的通风换气的装置也很好。有一种通风管，它可以把机器开动后飞散出来的麻屑和灰尘抽出厂外，使工人不会呼吸到这些肮脏的东西。还有一种通风换气管，它可以把厂内的浊气排出去，把新鲜的空气换进来；它可以调节厂内的温度，使其经常保持着和暖的程度。当你走进厂房的时候，你会感到这里永远是春天，永远是早晨。
    我走过几个分厂，我发觉我所走过的地板都是很柔软的。这是一种特制的化学地板。苏联专家考虑到洋灰地板太坚硬，又太潮湿，在这上面工作八小时是不舒适的，且易患关节炎，所以改用这种化学地板。在每个分厂的附近，都有“生活室”。在
    “生活室”里，有更衣室、接班室、浴室、食堂等。在工人上班和下班的时候，都能在这个“生活室”吃饭、洗澡、休息和更换衣裳。这些近代化的设计，给工人们带来了无限的幸福和快乐。
    参观过亚麻厂的人，都知道亚麻厂的工程质量是最好的。这是因为苏联专家在指导施工时，特别重视质量。苏联专家常常告诉我们：不重视质量，就等于破坏国家财产。因此在亚麻厂工作的人都把质量放在第一位。为了保证质量，苏联专家还要求每件工程必须按照操作规程来做，违反操作规程就是违反法令。在采用材料时，还必须试验材料的质量。由于这样，就完全保证了工程质量。
    亚麻厂修建的过程，是学习苏联先进经验的过程。在施工过程中，苏联专家教会了中国工人掌握先进的砌砖法，实行冬季施工和施工工厂化。在工厂修建期间，苏联专家还教会中国工人如何在新型的机器上操作。亚麻厂有个技术学校。技术学校有一切生产过程的模型。工人们下了班，可以到技术学校学习。苏联专家在这里指导工人学习技术理论和进行实际的试验。我们可以预计，不久的将来，亚麻厂将要培养出成批的有技术理论的优秀工人。
    亚麻厂的每台机器、每间房屋和每个建筑物，都是中苏两大民族兄弟般的友谊的结晶，都是伟大的苏联人民大公无私地帮助中国人民的灿烂的标志。我参观了亚麻厂，我感到苏联的帮助是我们走向幸福道路的重要条件。（附图片）
