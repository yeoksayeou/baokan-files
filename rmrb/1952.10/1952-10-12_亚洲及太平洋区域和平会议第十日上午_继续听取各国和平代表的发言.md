Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch:

    The tenth day of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference began at 9:20 AM on the 11th. The morning session heard speeches from nine representatives. Among the speakers were labor leaders, women's leaders, agricultural technicians, parliamentarians, professors, painters, and educators. They spoke on issues such as national independence, cultural exchange, and the protection of women's and children's welfare. Their common conclusion was: we must oppose and stop aggressive wars, and strive for and defend peace.

    The executive chairmen of the morning session were: Vadin Kojevnikov (Soviet Union), Cheikh Muhammad El-Achmar (Lebanon and Syria), Mrs. Eva Sanderson (Canada), Damaratana (Ceylon), and Allen Courtney Montish (New Zealand).

    The morning session began under the chairmanship of Executive Chairman Damaratana.

    Indian female representative, Mrs. Chattopadhyaya, a leader of the Bengal women's movement, first stood up to speak, saying: I am an ordinary woman, a wife and a mother, a peace lover who hates war from the bottom of my heart. During World War II, although India did not directly experience the war, more than 3.5 million people in Bengal Province died due to the famine caused by the war, tens of thousands of children became orphans, and countless women became beggars. Now, the Indian people are rising up to fight for peace. A month ago, in a small village in Bengal called Tamluk, more than 10,000 farmers signed a declaration calling for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact within two weeks, 70 percent of whom were women. Mrs. Chattopadhyaya emphasized: The fighting Korean women have brought new life and inspiration to our movement. I want to express my motherly love and affection to the mothers and children in the vast Asian and Pacific regions, and at the same time, on behalf of the Indian women, shout "Peace will triumph!"

    Louis Alley, Deputy Head of the New Zealand delegation and educator, gave a vivid speech that was very well received. Based on his personal experience in China for more than 20 years, he highly praised the achievements of New China. He said: After being moved by various facts, I feel happy and encouraged by the victory that this great people has achieved through long-term heroic struggle. Alley condemned the evil forces of foreign exploiters in China in the past, saying: It is beneficial for peace fighters from all countries to recognize these enemies of peace and warn the people of their countries to be vigilant. Alley praised the ability of ordinary people to strive for peace, and said: The hundreds of millions of ordinary Chinese people who have suffered from the trampling and contempt of reactionary forces in the past are now using their constructive power to create the destiny of China's 500 million people, and are radiating new hope to all oppressed people in the world. Alley finally emphasized the international nature of the struggle for peace, saying: Peace will spread everywhere, into everyone's heart. Peace is the foundation of all constructive life, and no matter how many difficulties there are, the road to peace can never be cut off.

    Indonesian representative, Mrs. Umi Sarjono, pointed out how American imperialism is trying to drag Indonesia into its war plans. She said that American imperialism controls the resources of the Indonesian people's lives, establishes war bases, and makes the Indonesian people bear the burden of loans, causing the Indonesian people pain and poverty. The wages of female workers in Indonesian private enterprises can only afford one-fifth of the minimum living standard. However, if the huge amount of wealth seized by foreign capital such as Royal Dutch Shell and Unilever were used to increase social spending, which only accounts for 2 percent of the national expenditure, it would mean that the people's social conditions would be improved. Mrs. Umi Sarjono emphasized: The current awakening and struggle of the Indonesian people is enough to defeat and stop American imperialism's attempt to drag Indonesia into its aggressive plans. We believe that due to the firm demands of peace-loving people all over the world, peace will surely be achieved, just as we firmly believed that fascism would be crushed in World War II. All the representatives applauded warmly to welcome her speech.

    Vietnamese representative, agricultural technician Huang Van Duc, pointed out: The fact that American imperialism is re-militarizing Japan is causing concern to the people of the Asia-Pacific region and the people of the world. Huang Van Duc painfully narrated the disasters brought to the Vietnamese people after the Japanese fascists invaded Vietnam during World War II. He said that at that time, the Japanese fascists plundered strategic materials from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and forced the Vietnamese people to pay grain and other agricultural products. Due to the double exploitation of the Japanese fascists and French colonialists, serious disasters occurred. For example, in the months from the end of 1944 to the beginning of 1945, 2 million people starved to death in a region with a population of 10 million in northern Vietnam. However, the Japanese fascists blocked granaries and prevented the transportation of relief grain. Huang Van Duc emphasized: The Vietnamese people must not forget these heinous crimes of the Japanese fascists. Now, American imperialism is re-supporting the Japanese militarist forces and preparing to send Japanese troops to fight in Vietnam, which has aroused great anger among the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people firmly oppose the unilateral peace treaty with Japan in San Francisco. The Vietnamese people know that those who represent the Japanese people are not those who are willing to be mercenaries for the American war-mongers, but all the Japanese people who are fighting for the right to survival, independence, peace, and democracy. The Vietnamese people are willing to unite closely with the Japanese people to fight against the conspiracy to re-revive Japanese militarism and endanger world peace. Huang Van Duc's speech was very warmly welcomed.

    Chinese representative, renowned bacteriologist Dr. Chen Wen-gui, walked onto the podium amidst enthusiastic applause and gave a speech on the use of bacteriological weapons by American armed forces in Korea and northeastern China. Representative Chen Wen-gui extended congratulations to the Chinese scientific workers who are working to smash the vicious conspiracy of the US government's bacteriological warfare, and reported on the situation of the US armed forces conducting bacteriological warfare that he personally confirmed. He described the process by which Chinese scientific workers formed the "Chinese People's Volunteer Anti-Epidemic Inspection Team" to extinguish the US government's bacteriological warfare, and listed in detail the bacteriological warfare facts that they confirmed with the most rigorous scientific attitude and methods. These facts are supported by ample evidence and witnesses. Chen Wen-gui especially cited the report issued by the International Scientific Committee composed of scientists from Sweden, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Brazil, and the Soviet Union after more than two months of on-site investigation. Chen Wen-gui emphasized: No one can fail to be angry when faced with such a crime. Chen Wen-gui condemned the US State Department for still denying their crimes with empty words, like a thief caught on the spot. Chen Wen-gui angrily questioned the US government and US generals: If this is the case, why do you refuse to ratify the 1925 "Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare" which you yourselves signed? Why do you stubbornly refuse to pass the solemn motion of the Soviet Union in the UN Security Council and the Disarmament Commission, demanding that governments of all countries approve the 1925 Geneva Protocol? Why are you so afraid of the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which embodies the conscience of mankind? Why, in March of this year, did your Chief of the Army Chemical Corps, Brigadier General Bullene, request additional funding from Congress to expand research on bacteriological warfare? Why did you say that "bacteria, poison gas, and radioactive materials may prove to be the cheapest weapons to conquer the enemy," and that when considering weapons to kill the enemy, there is no need to consider any moral concepts? Chen Wen-gui said: I hope that the US government, US generals, and their newspapers will come out to answer these questions, or even just answer any one of these questions. Chen Wen-gui further pointed out: He is a witness to the fact that the US government has sheltered and used Japanese and German "bacteriological warfare experts." He said that when the Japanese Air Force spread plague in Changde, Hunan in 1941, he conducted an investigation and wrote the "Report on the Plague in Changde, Hunan." After Japan surrendered in 1945, an American judge tricked him out of this report, while Japanese and German bacteriological warfare criminals were kept and utilized by American generals. Chen Wen-gui emphasized: Today's bacteriological warfare against the people of Korea and China is just a signal for the US government to conduct bacteriological warfare on a larger scale in the future. Dr. Chen Wen-gui, when discussing the US announcement on the 8th that it would indefinitely suspend the Korean armistice negotiations, emphasized that this shows that they have openly refused to use negotiation methods to fairly and reasonably resolve the problem, and openly undermined the armistice negotiations, attempting to expand the war by this means. Obviously, as long as the Korean War does not stop for a day, the threat of bacteriological warfare will continue to hang over the heads of people all over the world. Chen Wen-gui finally called on the people of the entire Asia-Pacific region to unite and strengthen their efforts to stop the US government from conducting bacteriological warfare, and to achieve an armistice in Korea and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Chen Wen-gui's speech received an extremely warm response, and all the representatives stood up and applauded to express their respect to the scientific workers who extinguished the American bacteriological warfare.

    Next, eight representatives of Christians in Beijing entered the venue amidst applause and music, and presented the conference with a silk banner embroidered with the words "Peace-loving Christians unite and strive to defend world peace." After they finished presenting the banner and walked down the podium, many foreign representatives shook hands with them cordially. Immediately afterwards, sixteen monks and nuns in robes, representing all the Buddhists in Beijing, presented the conference with a seven-story silver pagoda, an incense burner, and a silk banner with the inscription "Unite as one, defend peace." These religious believers expressed their enthusiasm for defending peace, which was met with long and enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    The meeting adjourned at this point and continued at 11:30 AM, chaired by Executive Chairman Cheikh Muhammad El-Achmar.

    Korean representative, Kim Young-soo, Vice-Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League, spoke on promoting the welfare of women and children. She listed examples of the American army's massacre of more than 300 women and children in Jiuxing Township, Sincheon County, Hwanghae Province, its inhumane use of bacteriological weapons, and its devastating bombing of peaceful Korean cities, and condemned the barbaric crimes of the American aggressors in slaughtering Korean women and children. Kim Young-soo emphasized that the American aggressors' extremely inhumane bacteriological warfare and devastating aerial terror in Korea were carried out during the armistice negotiations. This shows that the ruling group in the United States wants to use the armistice negotiations to expand the war; and it also shows that the misfortune that has fallen on Korean women and children today, will fall on the people, women and children of other Asian countries, and the possibility is increasing day by day. Kim Young-soo called on peace fighters in the Asia-Pacific region to save Korean women and children from the scourge of war, and to promptly reach an armistice agreement on a fair and reasonable basis to end the bloody Korean War. She called on mothers throughout the Asia-Pacific region to unite strongly and fight in the cause of maintaining peace for the happiness and peaceful life of their children. During Kim Young-soo's speech, warm applause repeatedly resounded throughout the venue, indicating the sympathy and support of representatives from all countries for the heroic Korean people. At the end of her speech, everyone stood up and applauded enthusiastically to respond to her call.

    Japanese representative, Kiyoshi Ozawa, a representative of the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, then spoke, discussing the Korean issue. He said that the Japanese people deeply feel that the Korean War will drag themselves into the vortex of war. The Japanese people unanimously hope to immediately stop the Korean War on a fair and reasonable basis. They are very angry at the US's delay and obstruction of the Korean armistice negotiations. He pointed out that the American army that invaded Korea has also illegally occupied Japan. The Japanese people oppose the US occupation forces stationed in Japan, depriving Japan of its independent sovereignty. Similarly, the Japanese people also oppose the American aggressors interfering in Korea, destroying Korean independence and unity. The goals of the struggles of the Korean people and the Japanese people are the same, both to uphold the principles of peace and democracy. He paid tribute to the Korean people on behalf of the Japanese people, and said: The great peace warriors of Korea are leading the forces of the entire nation in struggle, which is the most valuable lesson and encouragement for us Japanese people. We are determined to stand with you in the most difficult and glorious positions and fight to the end. Ozawa Kiyoshi's speech was welcomed by all the representatives.

    At the morning meeting, representatives from the peoples of Japan, Pakistan, and New Zealand expressed their sympathy and respect for the heroic Korean people by presenting flags, flowers, and gifts. The Japanese delegation presented the Korean delegation with a flag made in commemoration of the February 21, 1949 Day of Struggle against Colonialism, which had flown at the forefront of the Tokyo Peace Demonstration procession on May Day this year. It brought the deep friendship of Japanese women to Korean women. The Pakistani delegation presented the Korean delegation with a "Long Live Peace" flag and flowers expressing sympathy and friendship. The New Zealand delegation also presented clothes and flowers, and the representatives of the two countries embraced warmly on the podium. When the flags and gifts were presented, the entire audience stood up and applauded enthusiastically for this sincere friendship for more than ten minutes.

    Pakistani representative, Member of Parliament Sardar Shaukat Hayat, spoke as a veteran, saying: All the ugliness and horror I have seen in war make me unable to help but hate war and love peace, and I have no choice but to transform myself from a soldier engaged in war to a warrior fighting for peace. He angrily denounced the United States and its lackeys for violating the independence of Korea, refusing to repatriate prisoners of war and massacring them, and conducting bacteriological warfare. He said: Spreading bacteria to humans is not something humans do, it is something demons do. We emphatically demand an immediate end to this barbaric act, and demand that governments of all countries immediately ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol. Hayat warmly expressed the sympathy and support of the Pakistani people for the Korean people. He firmly declared: Pakistani friends of peace have solemnly resolved; we will definitely try not to let a Pakistani soldier wear American boots to desecrate the sacred land of Korea. If the enemies of peace must do this, they must first step over the corpses of Pakistani mothers, sisters, and sons. Hayat enthusiastically paid tribute to the new China, the beacon of peace on the Asian continent, saying: Everything we see here today far exceeds our highest imagination. With protectors like them, it is impossible to deprive Asia of its freedom. He hailed Chairman Mao Zedong as the father of the resurgence of Asia and a symbol of hope, and sincerely hoped that Pakistan and India and China would advance shoulder to shoulder in the great march towards freedom, progress, and peace. Hayat's passionate speech repeatedly aroused waves of applause.

    Chilean representative, Miria Lafente, President of the Chilean Intellectuals League and a painter, spoke out for the defense of national culture. She pointed out that imperialism fills our cinemas with films that instigate war or are disgustingly shallow, fills our markets with detective novels that praise crime and banditry, promotes the worship of North American racial superiority, and tries its best to portray the North American aggressors in Korea as legendary figures. All of this has brought fatal dangers to Chilean national culture and has similarly affected all Latin American countries. Lafente said: Chilean intellectuals have participated in the struggle of their own people for peace and progress, and when necessary, they have also taken to the streets. Finally, Lafente paid tribute to Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, on behalf of all the people's artists of Chile, and expressed that Chilean intellectuals would follow the example of Chinese intellectuals who bravely fought for peace.

    After Lafente's speech, the meeting adjourned. The plenary session continued in the evening.

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第十日上午
    继续听取各国和平代表的发言
    【新华社十一日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第十日会议在十一日上午九时二十分开始举行。上午会议听取了九个代表的发言。发言人当中有工人领袖、妇女领袖、农业技师、议员、教授、画家、教育工作者，他们谈到民族独立、文化交流和保卫妇女及儿童福利等问题，他们的共同结论是：必须反对和制止侵略战争，争取和保卫和平。
    上午会议的执行主席是：瓦丁姆·科热夫尼科夫（苏联），契克·穆哈默德·埃尔—阿契玛尔（黎巴嫩和叙利亚），伊娃·桑德逊夫人（加拿大），达马拉塔纳（锡兰），艾伦·柯特尼·蒙太施（新西兰）。
    上午会议在执行主席达马拉塔纳主持下开始。
    印度女代表、孟加拉妇女运动领袖查托巴达雅夫人首先起立发言说：我是一个普通妇女，一个妻子和一个母亲，一个从心底里憎恶战争的和平爱好者。第二次世界大战时，印度虽没有直接接触到战争，但在孟加拉省有三百五十万以上的人由于战争所造成的饥荒而死去，成千成万的儿童成为孤儿，无数妇女变成乞丐。现在，印度人民正奋起争取和平。一个月前在孟加拉的一个小乡村泰姆勒克，两星期内就有一万多农民在要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签了名，其中百分之七十是妇女。查托巴达雅夫人强调说：战斗中的朝鲜妇女给我们的运动带来了新的生命和新的鼓舞。我要向亚洲及太平洋广大区域里的母亲和孩子们表示我的母亲般的爱和感情，同时代表印度妇女高呼“和平胜利！”
    新西兰代表团副团长、教育工作者路易·艾黎作了一篇生动的发言，受到很大的欢迎。他以在中国二十多年的亲身感受，盛赞新中国的成就。他说：我在受到种种事实的感动以后，对于这个伟大人民在长期的英勇的斗争中所获得的胜利，感到欢欣鼓舞。艾黎痛斥过去在中国的外国剥削者的恶势力，他说：让各国和平战士们认清这些和平的敌人，并警告他们国家的人民提高警惕，是有好处的。艾黎称赞普通人民争取和平的能力，并且说：过去遭受过反动势力蹂躏和蔑视的亿万中国普通人民，今天就已在用他们的建设性的力量创造着中国五亿人民的命运，并且向全世界一切被压迫人民放射出新的希望的光芒。艾黎最后强调争取和平斗争的国际性说：和平会到处散布，散布到每个人的心中。和平是一切建设性生活的基础，不管有多少困难，走向和平之路是永远无法切断的。
    印尼代表乌米·萨约诺夫人发言指出美帝国主义设法把印尼拖进战争计划中去的情形。她说美帝国主义控制了印尼人民的生活资源，建立战争基地，并叫印尼人民负上借款的重担，使印尼人民痛苦和贫穷。印尼私营企业的女工的工资只能过最低生活标准的五分之一的生活，但是，如果把被外国资本如皇家壳牌石油公司与尤尼莱佛公司所夺去的巨额财富，用来增加仅占国家支出百分之二的社会费，那就意味着人民的社会条件会得到改善。乌米·萨约诺夫人强调说：目前印尼人民的觉醒和斗争是足以打败和制止美帝国主义把印尼拖进它的侵略计划的图谋的。我们相信，由于全世界爱好和平人民的坚决要求，和平一定能实现，正像我们在第二次世界大战中坚信法西斯主义一定会被粉碎一样。全体代表热烈鼓掌欢迎她的发言。
    越南代表、农业技师黄文德发言指出：美帝国主义使日本重新军国主义化的事实，使亚洲太平洋区域人民和全世界人民感到忧虑。黄文德沉痛地叙述第二次世界大战期间日本法西斯侵入越南后给越南人民带来的灾难。他说当时日本法西斯搜括越南、高棉、寮国的战略物资，强迫越南人民缴纳谷物及其他农作物。由于日本法西斯和法国殖民者的双重剥削，曾发生了严重的灾害，例如在一九四四年底到一九四五年初的几个月内，在越南北部有一个有一千万人口的地区内饿死了二百万人。而日本法西斯却封锁谷仓、拦阻运送救济粮。黄文德强调说：越南人民决不能忘记日本法西斯的这些滔天罪行。现在美帝国主义重新扶植日本军国主义势力，并准备派遣日本军队到越南作战，已经引起越南人民的极大愤怒。越南人民坚决反对旧金山的片面对日和约。越南人民知道代表日本人民的不是那班甘心给美国战争贩子充当雇佣兵的人，而是一切正在争取生存权利，争取独立、和平、民主而斗争的日本人民。越南人民愿与日本人民紧密团结，为反对重新复活日本军国主义危害世界和平的阴谋而斗争。黄文德的发言受到极热烈的欢迎。
    中国代表、著名细菌学家陈文贵博士在热烈掌声中走上主席台，发表了关于美国武装部队在朝鲜和中国东北等地使用细菌武器的讲演。陈文贵代表正在为粉碎美国政府细菌战的恶毒阴谋而工作的中国科学工作者向大会致贺，并且报告了他亲自证实的美国武装部队进行细菌战的情形。他叙述了中国科学工作者组成“中国人民志愿防疫检验队”扑灭美国政府细菌战的经过情形，并且详细列举他们用最严格的科学态度和方法来证实了的细菌战事实。这些事实都有充分的人证物证。陈文贵特别举出了由瑞典、英国、法国、意大利、巴西和苏联的科学家组成的国际科学委员会经过两个多月的现场调查后所发表的报告书。陈文贵强调说：没有一个人能够面对这样的罪行而不愤怒。陈文贵痛斥美国国务院像当场被捉住的贼一样，仍然空口否认他们的罪行。陈文贵愤怒地质问美国政府和美国将军们说：既然如此，你们为什么拒绝批准你们自己签了字的一九二五年“关于禁用毒气或类似毒品及细菌方法作战议定书”呢？为什么你们在联合国安理会以及裁军委员会上顽固地拒绝通过苏联关于要求各国政府批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书的庄严议案呢？你们为什么那样地害怕表现了人类的良心的一九二五年日内瓦议定书呢？为什么在今年三月，你们的陆军化学兵团司令布伦少将向国会要求增拨款项来扩充细菌战的研究工作呢？你们为什么要说“细菌、毒气和放射性物质可能证明是征服敌人的最廉价的武器”，并且说在考虑致敌人于死命的武器时，不必考虑什么道德观念呢？陈文贵说：我希望美国政府、美国将军和他们的报纸走出来回答我的这些问题，甚至仅仅回答这些问题中的任何一个问题。陈文贵进一步指出：他就是美国政府庇护并利用日本和德国的“细菌战专家”这一事实的见证人。他说一九四一年日本空军在湖南常德散播鼠疫时，他曾进行调查，写成了“湖南常德鼠疫报告书”。一九四五年日本投降后，一个美国法官把这个报告书骗了去，而日本、德国的细菌战犯却被美国将军们豢养利用。陈文贵强调说：今天对朝、中人民的细菌作战，不过是美国政府将来进行更大规模的细菌战的信号。陈文贵博士在论及美国方面已在八日宣布无限期中止朝鲜停战谈判时，着重地指出：这表明他们已经公开地拒绝用协商方法来公平合理地解决问题，并公开地破坏停战谈判，企图借此来扩大战争。显然地朝鲜战争一天不停止，细菌战的威胁就一天不断地悬在全世界人民的头上。陈文贵最后号召全亚洲及太平洋区域的人民团结起来，为制止美国政府进行细菌战、为达到朝鲜停战和朝鲜问题的和平解决而加强努力。陈文贵的发言得到极热烈的响应，全体代表起立鼓掌，向扑灭美国细菌战的科学工作者表示敬意。
    接着，北京市基督徒的八个代表在掌声及音乐声中进入会场，以绣有“爱好和平的基督徒团结起来为保卫世界和平而努力”的锦旗一面献给大会。他们献旗毕走下主席台后，好多外国代表都和他们亲切地握手。紧接着有十六个披着袈裟的僧尼，代表全北京佛教徒以七层银塔一座，香炉一尊和题有“团结一心、保卫和平”的字样的锦旗一面献给大会。这些宗教信徒表示了保卫和平的热忱，全场为之长久地热烈鼓掌。
    会议至此休会，在十一时三十分继续进行，由执行主席契克·穆哈默德·埃尔—阿契玛尔主持。
    朝鲜代表、朝鲜民主妇女同盟副委员长金英秀作了关于增进妇女与儿童福利的发言。她列举美国军队在黄海道信川郡久兴面屠杀妇女儿童三百多人、灭绝人性的使用细菌武器、对朝鲜和平城市进行毁灭性的轰炸等事例，义正词严地谴责美国侵略者屠杀朝鲜妇女和儿童的野蛮罪行。金英秀强调说：美国侵略者对朝鲜的极无人道的细菌战和毁灭性的空中恐怖，都是在停战谈判期中进行的，这就说明了美国的统治集团是要利用停战谈判来扩大战争；并说明了今天落在朝鲜妇女和儿童头上的不幸，明天也会落在亚洲其他国家的人民和妇女儿童头上的可能性正日渐增加。金英秀呼吁亚洲及太平洋区域的和平战士，为了把朝鲜的妇女和儿童从战争灾难中拯救出来，力促在公平合理的基础上迅速达成停战协议以结束流血的朝鲜战争，她号召全亚洲及太平洋区域的母亲们为了子女的幸福与和平生活，在维护和平的事业中，坚强地团结起来进行斗争。金英秀发言时，全场一再响起热烈掌声，表明各国代表对英雄的朝鲜人民的同情和支持，她的发言结束时，全体起立热烈鼓掌来回答了她的号召。
    日本代表、全日本产业别工会会议代表小泽清接着发言，讨论朝鲜问题。他说，日本人民深切感到朝鲜战争将使自己卷入战争的漩涡。日本人民一致切望在公平合理的基础上立即停止朝鲜战争。他们对于美国拖延和阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的进行，感到非常愤怒。他指出，侵略朝鲜的美国军队，同样非法地占领了日本。日本人民反对美国占领军驻在日本，剥夺日本的独立主权。同样日本人民也反对美国侵略者干涉朝鲜，破坏朝鲜的独立和统一。朝鲜人民和日本人民的斗争目的是一致的，都是为了维护和平民主的原则。他代表日本人民向朝鲜人民致敬，并说：朝鲜伟大的和平战士领导全民族的力量进行斗争，对我们日本人民是最宝贵的教训和鼓励。我们誓必和你们一道站在最困难最光荣的岗位上斗争到底。小泽清的发言，受到全体代表的欢迎。
    在上午会议上，日本、巴基斯坦和新西兰人民的代表，用献旗、献花和献礼来表示他们对英雄的朝鲜人民的同情和尊敬。日本代表团献给朝鲜代表团的是一面为纪念一九四九年二月二十一日反对殖民制度斗争日而制成的旗帜，它曾飘扬在今年五一节东京和平大示威队伍的前列。它带来了日本妇女对朝鲜妇女的深厚的友情。巴基斯坦代表团献给朝鲜代表团的是一面“和平万岁”的旗帜，和表示同情和友好的鲜花。新西兰代表团也献赠了衣服和鲜花，两国代表在主席台上热烈拥抱。献旗献礼时，全场起立为这种真挚的和平友谊热烈鼓掌达十数分钟。
    巴基斯坦代表，国会议员萨达尔·修格特·哈雅特以一个退伍军人的身份发言，他说：我所看到战争中的一切丑恶和恐怖使我不能不痛恨战争，热爱和平，不得不把自己从一个从事战争的士兵变成一个争取和平的战士。他义愤地斥责美国及其走狗们侵犯朝鲜的独立，拒绝遣返战俘并屠杀他们，以及进行细菌战等罪行。他说：对人类散布细菌不是人做的事，是魔鬼做的事。我们着重地要求立刻终止这种野蛮行为，并且要求各国政府立刻批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书。哈雅特热烈地表示了巴基斯坦人民对朝鲜人民的同情和支援，他坚定地宣称：巴基斯坦的和平朋友们已经庄严地下定决心；我们一定努力不让一个巴基斯坦兵士穿上美国的军靴，来玷污朝鲜神圣的土地。假如和平的敌人一定要这样做，他们首先就得踩过巴基斯坦母亲、姊妹和儿子们的尸体。哈雅特热情地向亚洲大陆上的和平灯塔新中国致敬，他说：我们今天在这儿所看到的一切，远远地超过了我们最高的想像。有着像他们这样的保卫者，要想剥夺亚洲的自由是决不可能的。他欢呼毛泽东主席为亚洲的复兴之父和希望的象征，并诚恳地希望巴基斯坦和印度和中国在走向自由、进步与和平的大进军中并肩前进。哈雅特的热情洋溢的演说曾一再引起怒涛般的掌声。
    智利代表、智利知识分子联盟主席、画家米里亚·拉芬脱发言呼吁保卫民族文化，她指出：帝国主义以煽动战争或是令人作呕地浅薄的影片充塞我们的电影界，使我们的市场充满着赞扬罪恶和强盗行为的侦探小说，它宣扬对于北美种族优越的崇拜，尽力把在朝鲜的北美侵略者描写为传奇式的人物。这一切给智利民族文化带来了致命的危险，并同样地影响到所有的拉丁美洲各国。拉芬脱说：智利的知识分子参加了本国人民争取和平与进步的斗争，在必要的时候，他们也走到街头上去。拉芬脱最后代表智利所有的人民艺术家向中国人民领袖毛泽东致敬，并表示智利知识分子将追随英勇地为争取和平而斗争的中国知识分子的榜样前进。
    在拉芬脱发言后，会议即告休会。全体会议在晚间继续举行。
