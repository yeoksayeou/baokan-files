To General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

On the occasion of the glorious festival of the Chinese people – the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I, on behalf of the Korean people and the officers and men of the Korean People's Army, as well as in my own name, extend warm congratulations to you and the officers and men of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the great Chinese people have made tremendous achievements in the great cause of building a new China in the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. This has made a great contribution to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world.

The Korean people and the Korean People's Army, who have risen up to wage a just war for the independence, freedom and honor of their motherland and to resist the armed aggression of the US and Britain, are further strengthened in their confidence in victory, inspired by the fraternal friendship and assistance of the Chinese people and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers.

I wish you and all the officers and men of the Chinese People's Volunteers greater victories and achievements in the sacred struggle to eliminate our common enemy, the US imperialist aggressors.

Kim Il-sung
Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
September 29, 1952, in Pyongyang
