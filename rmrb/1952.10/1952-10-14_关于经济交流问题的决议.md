    Resolution on Economic Exchange Issues
    We, the representatives participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, believe that we must work together to develop peaceful international economic relations and improve the living conditions of the people.
    We note with grave concern the increasingly tense economic situation created by the U.S. government in implementing its war policy. This policy has resulted in: huge military expenditures, market monopolies, manipulation of the prices of major raw materials, blockades and embargoes, and other artificial barriers to the development of trade.
    These measures by the U.S. government, and its control of the economies of other countries, have exacerbated the economic imbalances of these countries, increased inflationary pressures, lowered production levels, curtailed foreign trade, lowered living standards, increased unemployment, and caused severe food panics and famines in some areas.
    Therefore, the representatives attending this conference specially call upon the governments and peoples of the countries concerned, regardless of their differences in political and economic systems, to work together to change the tendency towards war and turn their economies to serve peace, develop international trade, and establish normal international economic relations.
    This conference hereby resolves:
    (1) To call upon the people of Asian and Pacific countries and the people of the world to promote the development of international trade based on equality and mutual benefit, and the establishment of normal economic relations; and to strive to eliminate all artificial barriers and blockades and embargoes, and to oppose monopolies and the manipulation of the prices of major raw materials and food produced by other countries.
    (2) To recommend that governments and peoples of countries in this region establish normal economic relations, conclude trade agreements, hold international exhibitions of industrial and agricultural products, and promote various forms of trade and economic contact.
    (3) To call upon the United Nations to take immediate necessary steps to eliminate artificial barriers to international trade that violate the spirit of the United Nations Charter, and to promote the development of normal trade between countries.
    (4) To respect the right of the people of all countries to freely choose their economic system; to oppose any infringement of this right; to oppose foreign economic control for war purposes over the majority of countries in this region; and to sympathize with the independent economic development of these countries, so that the people can exert their creativity for peaceful construction.
    (5) To urge the representatives of all countries participating in this conference to widely disseminate the contents of this resolution to their own people, and to mobilize them to work together to develop international economic cooperation under peaceful conditions.
    (6) To recommend that the liaison organization of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Movement established by this conference maintain close contact with the International Trade Promotion Committee in order to achieve the concrete implementation of this resolution.
                                October 12, 1952, Beijing

    关于经济交流问题的决议
    我们参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的全体代表认为：我们必需为发展和平的国际经济关系，及改善人民的生活条件而共同努力。
    我们以严重的关切注视着美国政府为执行它的战争政策而造成的日益紧张的经济情势。这种政策引起了：巨大的军事支出、市场的垄断、主要原料价格的操纵、封锁和禁运以及其他对贸易发展的人为障碍。
    美国政府的这些措施以及它对于别国经济的控制，加重了这些国家的经济不平衡，加重了通货膨胀的压力，降低了生产水平，减缩了对外贸易，降低了生活标准，增加了失业人数，并且造成了某些地区的严重的粮食恐慌和饥馑。
    因此，参加这个会议的代表特号召有关各国的政府和人民，不管他们在政治经济制度上的歧异，都来共同努力改变走向战争的倾向而把他们的经济转为和平而服务，发展国际贸易，并建立国际经济的正常关系。
    本会议兹议决：
    （一）号召亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民及全世界人民，起来推动以平等互利为基础的国际贸易的发展，和正常经济关系的建立；并为消除一切人为障碍和封锁禁运而努力，反对垄断市场和操纵别国所生产的主要原料及粮食的价格。
    （二）建议本区域各国政府及人民之间建立正常的经济关系，订立贸易协定，举办国际工农产品的展览，并促进各种方式的贸易和经济的接触。
    （三）呼吁联合国立即采取必要步骤，取消违反联合国宪章精神的对于国际贸易的人为障碍，并促进发展各国间的正常贸易。
    （四）尊重各国人民自己有自由选择他们经济制度的权利；反对侵犯这种权利；反对外来的为了战争目的而对于本区域内大多数国家的经济控制；同情于这些国家经济的独立发展，使人民能为和平建设事业而发挥其创造力。
    （五）敦促参加本会议的各国代表，为广泛向本国人民传达本决议的内容，并动员他们为开展在和平条件下的国际经济合作而共同努力。
    （六）建议由本会议所建立的亚洲及太平洋区域和平运动联络机构与国际贸易促进委员会密切联系，以谋本决议的具体实施。
                                一九五二年十月十二日于北京
