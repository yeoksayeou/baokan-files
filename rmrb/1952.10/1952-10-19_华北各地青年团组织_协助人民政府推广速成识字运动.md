Youth League organizations in North China are actively assisting People's Governments in promoting the rapid literacy campaign. Currently, 1,080,000 people in the region are participating in rapid literacy studies, a significant portion of whom are young people and Youth League members. According to statistics, among the more than 300 experimental villages in Shanxi Province, a total of 26,000 farmers have enrolled, of which more than 14,500 are young farmers, accounting for 56% of the total enrollment, including more than 4,900 League members, accounting for 18.9% of the total enrollment. The state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory has 4,324 people participating in rapid literacy studies, with young workers accounting for half, and League members numbering 536, nearly one-quarter of the young people enrolled.

Youth League organizations at all levels attach great importance to the experimentation and promotion of the rapid literacy method, listing it as one of the important tasks within the League. Most provincial and municipal League committees have participated in the leadership organs of the local literacy campaigns and have issued notices calling on League organizations and members at all levels to actively participate in the movement to promote the rapid literacy method. At the beginning of August, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Youth League convened a meeting of the heads of the propaganda departments of the League's prefectural and municipal committees to specifically arrange the work of the League organizations to assist the government in vigorously carrying out the literacy movement, deciding to strive to eliminate one million illiterate people in the province this year. Each provincial and municipal League committee propaganda department has a person specifically responsible for this work, and some League committees have sent cadres to participate in the experimental work to summarize the experience of the League's role in the literacy movement. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the League decided to run a rapid primary school within the League school to systematically eliminate illiteracy among League cadres (the first phase of eighty illiterate League cadres was eliminated in mid-August), and requires county and district League cadres with a junior high school education to learn the teaching method of the rapid literacy method. Under the call of the League organizations in various places, illiterate and semi-literate League members actively participated in rapid literacy studies. For example, in the five experimental villages of Nanpang Village, Caohe Village, and Guojiaying Village in Xushui County, Hebei Province, and Xiasile Village and Baiyangyu in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, all illiterate and semi-literate League members participated in the experimental classes. In addition, according to statistics from five counties in Hebei Province, Luanan, Li County, Daming, Yi County, and Jiaohe, the League members enrolled accounted for more than 90% of the illiterate people within the League.

The League's grassroots organizations and League members have played a significant role in promoting the rapid literacy method and literacy learning. The first is to assist the Party and the government in doing a good job in ideological mobilization. In areas where the rapid literacy method is being experimented with and promoted, the masses generally expressed skepticism about the rapid literacy method and lacked confidence in learning at the beginning. In response to various ideological situations, the League organizations used various methods such as blackboards, reading groups, rooftop broadcasts, family visits, slogans, and forums to widely carry out propaganda and mobilization work, explaining the relationship between eliminating illiteracy and national construction and the benefits of learning the rapid literacy method, dispelling the masses' ideological concerns. After the Youth League branch of Xirong Village, Yuci County, Shanxi Province, organized the masses to visit the Jinyuan State-owned Farm, the masses realized that in order to develop production, increase output, and use new agricultural tools, it was necessary to learn culture. The forums and grievance meetings of young worker illiterates convened by the League organizations of the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and the private Beiyang Yarn Factory greatly encouraged the learning enthusiasm and passion of young workers. Secondly, League members can set an example in learning, actively taking the lead, studying hard, and doing a good job in learning mutual assistance. There are six League members in the Yulinbao rapid literacy experimental class in Yanqing County, Chahar, four of whom serve as leaders of the learning groups. Ma Xiuying, a special learning model and Youth League member, studied diligently and led the group to do a good job in learning. In one test, the average score of all six members of the group was 96 points, and four of them each scored 100 points. The group led by Hua Heyun, a League member of the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, consisted mostly of older workers and female workers with children, but no one dropped out; she also introduced the experience of leading the group to the whole class, making the class the one with the fewest absentees in the factory. Hua Heyun not only learned well herself, but also united the group and motivated the whole class; she also created a method of using cardboard to record phonetic symbols and new words to help everyone learn, becoming a learning model for the whole factory. In addition, League members often lead the masses to carry out mutual assistance reviews during extracurricular time to consolidate learning results. In the experimental class, in order to meet the needs of the learning situation, temporary League branches and groups were organized to grasp the ideology and learning situation of the students, arrange tasks for League members, and help the masses solve various practical difficulties; League members often carried out criticism and self-criticism to maintain full learning emotions, which greatly helped promote learning. Thirdly, the League organizations have sent League members with appropriate qualifications to serve as teachers, counselors, and "little teachers," which has greatly helped the development of the rapid literacy movement. The League organization of the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory selected and sent 25 League members with a higher level of education to enter the spare-time school. After a short period of training, some of them served as teachers and some as counselors. Because they understand the needs of national construction, deeply understand the suffering of having no culture, and are familiar with the lives of workers, they are able to work hard and are extremely popular with the students in teaching. In addition to strengthening ideological education for these League members, the League organization has reduced their other positions and activities within the League, allowing them to play a greater role in teaching. The League branches in many areas have also actively improved the relationship between teachers and students, achieving the goal of good teaching by teachers and good learning by students.

    华北各地青年团组织
    协助人民政府推广速成识字运动
    华北区各地青年团的组织积极协助人民政府推广速成识字运动。目前全区参加速成识字学习的有一百零八万人，其中有很大一部分是青年和青年团员。据统计，山西全省三百多个实验村中，入学农民共二万六千人，其中青年农民有一万四千五百多人，占入学总人数的百分之五十六，其中有团员四千九百多人，占入学总人数的百分之十八点九。国营天津第二棉纺织厂有四千三百二十四人参加速成识字学习，其中青年工人占半数，团员有五百三十六人，几占青年入学人数的四分之一。
    各级青年团的组织很重视速成识字法的实验与推广工作，将其列为团内重要工作之一。大部省、市团委都参加了各地扫盲运动的领导机构，并发出通知号召各级团的组织和团员，积极参加推行速成识字法的运动。青年团山西省委在八月初召开了团地委、市委宣传部长会议，具体布置了团的组织协助政府大力开展识字运动的工作，决定为完成今年全省扫除一百万文盲而奋斗。各省、市团委宣传部都设有专人负责这一工作，部分团委并派了干部参加实验工作，总结团在识字运动中发挥作用的经验。团山西省委决定在团校内举办速成小学，有计划地扫除团干部中的文盲（第一期八十个文盲团干部，已于八月中扫除），并要求具有高小文化程度的县区团干部，都要学会速成识字法的教学方法。在各地团组织的号召下，文盲和半文盲的团员积极参加了速成识字学习。如河北省徐水县南庞村、漕河村、果家营村，山西省昔阳县的下思乐村、白洋峪等五个实验村，全体文盲和半文盲的团员都参加了实验班。另外据河北省滦南、蠡县、大名、易县、交河等五个县的统计，入学的团员占团内文盲的百分之九十以上。
    团的基层组织和团员在推行速成识字法和识字学习中，发挥了很大的作用。首先是协助党和政府做好思想动员工作。在实验和推行速成识字法的地区，开始时群众一般对速成识字法表示怀疑，缺乏学习信心。针对各种不同的思想情况，团组织运用了黑板报、读报组、屋顶广播、家庭访问、标语、座谈会等各种方式，广泛地展开宣传动员工作，说明扫除文盲与国家建设的关系和学习速成识字法的好处，解除了群众的思想顾虑。山西省榆次县西荣村团支部组织群众参观了晋源国营农场以后，群众知道了要发展生产、提高产量，使用新式农具，必需学文化。国营天津第一棉纺织厂与私营北洋纱厂团组织召集的青年工人文盲座谈会和诉苦会，大大地鼓舞了青年工人的学习积极性和热情。其次，团员在学习中都能以身作则，积极带头，苦学苦练，搞好学习互助等工作。察哈尔延庆县榆林堡速成识字实验班中有六名团员，其中四人担任了学习小组长。特等学习模范、青年团员马秀英，自己刻苦学习，并领导小组把学习搞好，在一次测验中，全组六人平均得九十六分，其中有四人各得一百分。国营天津第一棉纺织厂团员滑鹤云所领导的小组，多半是老年工人和有了孩子的女工，但没有一个人掉队；她并向全班介绍了领导小组的经验，使该班成为全厂缺课人数最少的一班。滑鹤云不仅自己学得好，并团结了小组，带动了全班；她还创造了用硬纸片记注音符号和生字的办法，帮助大家学习，成为全厂学习的模范。此外，团员还经常带动群众利用课外时间展开互助复习，巩固了学习成果。在实验班中，为了适应学习情况的需要，组织了临时团支部和小组，掌握学员的思想和学习情况，布置团员任务，帮助群众解决各种实际困难；团员经常展开批评与自我批评，保持饱满的学习情绪，对推动学习有很大帮助。第三，团的组织输送具有适当条件的团员担任教员、辅导员和小先生，对速成识字运动的开展有很大帮助。国营天津第二棉纺织厂团的组织选拔和输送了二十五名文化水平较高的团员进入业余学校，经过短期的训练以后，他们之中有的担任了教师，有的作了辅导员。由于他们了解到国家建设的需要，深切懂得没有文化的苦处，熟悉工人生活，所以在教学中他们都能任劳任怨，极受学员的欢迎。团的组织除了加强对这些团员的思想教育以外，并减少了他们在团内的其他职务和活动，使他们在教学中发挥更大的作用。许多地区的团支部并积极改善师生的关系，达到了教员教好、学员学好的目的。
