The Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued a "Decision on Further Developing Material Exchange and Strengthening Leadership Over Primary Markets." The decision pointed out: Strengthening material exchange work, especially doing a good job in short-distance material exchange in primary markets, is the main key to the further development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry production and the continued improvement of people's lives. Over the past three years, due to the rapid recovery and development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, and the expansion of national material exchange, the Northwest has rapidly changed the poor and backward economic outlook left over from long-term reactionary rule; especially since the great movements of land reform, increasing production and practicing economy, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti," various social and economic components have been developing along the track of New Democracy. However, due to the vastness of the Northwest region, inconvenient transportation, and the insufficient depth of work by leading departments and the lack of clear understanding in the minds of general cadres, many problems still exist in material exchange work—especially in primary markets—that have not been well resolved. To this end, the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee especially calls on Party committees and people's government financial departments at all levels, as well as Party members in relevant departments, to implement this decision. The main content of the decision is as follows: Each province should convene a material exchange conference or material exchange symposium in counties or autonomous regions and special districts before the end of this year, to overcome the current state of spontaneous flow in primary markets in various places and to develop short-distance material exchange. These exchange conferences or symposiums should pay attention to closely combining with the business activities and market activity of local private merchants, specifically solving existing problems, and publicizing the important significance and policies of developing material exchange, and must not be reduced to mere formality. Various regions must strengthen contact and closely cooperate. The convening of the meetings should be planned comprehensively by the higher-level Party committee in conjunction with the government. Some problems that cannot be solved should be reported level by level for assistance. In rural areas, pastoral areas, and mountainous areas with better conditions, attention should be paid to strengthening and establishing regular or fixed fairs based on specific conditions; in areas where conditions are not yet ripe, mobile trade teams should be dispatched as much as possible to solve the urgent needs of local people in production and life. In these primary markets or mobile trade teams, state-owned companies and cooperatives should play a leading role in organization and leadership, and relevant departments such as banks, taxation, and transportation should also cooperate. However, the main thing is to mobilize the vast number of private merchants and peddlers to actively engage in deep purchasing and long-distance sales. Only in this way can trade in these areas be developed extensively and deeply.

    中共中央西北局决定
    进一步开展物资交流加强对初级市场领导
    中共中央西北局发布“为进一步开展物资交流加强对初级市场领导”的决定。决定指出：加强物资交流工作，特别是做好初级市场的短距离物资交流工作，是工、农、畜牧业生产进一步发展与人民生活继续改善的主要关键。三年来，由于工、农、畜牧业生产的迅速恢复与发展，以及全国物资交流的展开，西北已经迅速改变着长期反动统治所遗留下来的贫困落后的经济面貌；特别自土地改革、增产节约、“三反”“五反”等伟大的运动以后，各种社会经济成分已循着新民主主义的轨道向前发展。但因西北地区辽阔、交通不便，以及领导部门工作的不够深入与一般干部思想认识上的不够明确等原因，在物资交流工作——尤其是在初级市场中还存在许多问题未能很好解决。为此，中共中央西北局特号召各级党委和人民政府财经部门及有关部门中的党员贯彻执行这个决定。决定主要内容如下：各省应在今年年底以前，在县或自治区及专区普遍召开一次物资交流大会或物资交流座谈会，以克服目前各地初级市场的自流状态，开展短距离的物资交流。这些交流大会或座谈会，应注意与当地私商的经营活动及市场活跃紧密地结合起来，具体解决存在的问题并宣传开展物资交流的重要意义与政策，不得流于形式。各地区之间必须加强联系，紧密配合，会议的举行应由上一级党委协同政府通盘筹划，有些不能解决的问题，逐级上报予以协助解决。在农村、牧区、山地条件较好的地方，应视具体情况注意加强与建立定期的或固定的集市；条件不成熟的地方，则应尽可能派出流动贸易组，解决当地人民生产、生活上的迫切需要。这些初级市场或流动贸易组，国营公司、合作社应起带头的组织领导作用，银行、税收、交通等有关部门亦应予以配合。但更主要的是发动广大私商、肩挑小贩进行深购远销的积极经营。只有这样，才能使这些地区的贸易广泛而深入地开展起来。
