    Cultural Briefs
    Introduction to the Contents of Serial Pictorial Magazine, Issue 34
    Serial Pictorial Magazine, Issue 34 has been published. The publication of this issue coincides with the upcoming second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the Korean War. Therefore, several of the pictures are in line with the central theme of resisting America and aiding Korea. The cover, "A Break in the Fighting," is painted by Gu Yuan and depicts the battlefield life of the Volunteers on the Korean front. The "Major World Events" section narrates the comparison of enemy and our forces on the Korean battlefield, the enthusiastic support of the Volunteers by the people of the whole country, and the various efforts made to strive for the early realization of peace.
    The "Stories" section includes the story of an air battle, "Volunteer Air Force Hero Zhao Baotong" (painted by Song Buyun); a depiction of railway workers of the Volunteer Army aiding Korea repairing railways and rescuing trains, "The Task of Opening the Line is Completed" (painted by He Youzhi et al.); and a description of two young sisters making comfort bags for the Volunteers and loving them, "The Two Sisters" (painted by Cao Shiqi). In addition, there is "Midnight Rooster's Crow" (painted by Jiang Ying), adapted from Gao Yubao's novel. The "Folk Tale" in this issue is "Notching the Boat to Find the Sword" (painted by Bu Xiaohuai); the "Scientific Knowledge" section is "Afforestation in the Rainy Season." It is particularly worth mentioning that the "Mass Works" in this issue publishes "Reply to the People of the Motherland" written by the Volunteers.
    Two Relatively Complete Books of Materials on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation
    Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government published "Reference Materials for Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Teams" (First Collection) and "Reference Materials for Agricultural Production Cooperatives." "Reference Materials for Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Teams" selects a total of fifteen articles on the experience of developing and consolidating mutual aid teams, and provides rich materials on the situation of agricultural production mutual aid teams in various places. "Reference Materials for Agricultural Production Cooperatives" mainly selects the experiences of eight typical production cooperatives, such as Jin Shilong and Chuan Di Village. The editors added notes before the selected experiences of various types of agricultural production cooperatives, explaining the characteristics of the production cooperative, the existing problems, and the points that should be paid attention to in research. The beginning of the volume contains an article by the Agricultural Policy Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, "Some Problems in the Current Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives," which provides a comprehensive analysis and research on agricultural production cooperatives in various places and criticizes some erroneous ideas in the work of organizing agricultural production cooperatives.

    连环画报第三十四期内容介绍
    连环画报第三十四期已出版。这一期出版的时候，正是中国人民志愿军出国作战二周年快来到的时候，所以有几篇画是配合着抗美援朝这个中心的。封面是古元画的“战斗的空隙”，表现了朝鲜前线志愿军战地生活。“天下大事”栏叙述了朝鲜战场敌我力量的对比，全国人民热烈地支援着志愿军，并为争取和平早日实现作着各种不同的努力。
    “故事”栏内有叙述空战故事的“志愿军空军英雄赵宝桐”（宋步云画）；有描写志愿援朝铁路工人抢修铁路、抢救列车的“通车任务完成了”（贺友直等画）；有描写两个小姊妹为志愿军做慰问袋，热爱志愿军的“姊妹俩”（曹世琦画）。此外还有根据高玉宝的小说改编而画成的“半夜鸡叫”（江荧画）。“民间故事”这期是“刻船找剑”（卜孝怀画）；“科学知识”是“雨季造林”。特别应该一提的，是这期的“群众习作”刊载了志愿军所作的“回答祖国人民”。
    两种较完整的关于农业生产互助合作资料的书
    最近中央人民政府农业部出版了“农业生产互助组参考资料”（第一集）和“农业生产合作社参考资料”两书。“农业生产互助组参考资料”共选辑了十五篇关于发展和巩固互助组的经验的文章，并对各地农业生产互助组的情况，提供了丰富的材料。“农业生产合作社参考资料”主要是选录金时龙、川底村等八个典型生产合作社的经验而成的。编者在所选各种类型农业生产合作社经验的前面加有按语，说明该生产合作社的特点、存在的问题以及应行注意研究之点。卷首有中央人民政府农业部农政司“目前农业生产合作社发展中的一些问题”一文，对各地农业生产合作社作了全盘的分析研究，并批判了组织农业生产合作社工作中的若干错误思想。
