    ?Suriya Thongwanit's speech (summary)
    I, on behalf of the eighteen million people of Thailand, extend my highest respect to all the peace delegates, and to the Chinese government and people, the host of this historic conference, for demonstrating the true force of defending peace and initiating the conference!
    The Thai people clearly see that around their country, such as in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya, colonialists are increasingly intensifying the suppression of the people's liberation movement. Because Thailand has abundant resources and is located in a strategic location, the United States is sparing no effort to use various means to turn Thailand into a base for launching aggressive wars according to its war plan. This behavior threatens the peace of Asia. The Thai people demand peace and oppose war!
    The reason why the United States signed a separate peace treaty and military agreement with Japan is to revive Japanese militarism, turn Japan into a military base for the United States, and use Japanese militarism as a tool for launching new wars. This seriously threatens world peace and is dangerous for Thailand. The Japanese militarists' occupation of Thailand during the last war caused serious disasters and hardships, which are still fresh in the memory of the Thai people. The Thai people realize that to ensure that Japanese militarism is not revived, a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan is needed, and Japan needs complete independence and democracy.
    Human beings have been fighting against diseases for thousands of years and have gradually overcome them. Now, the United States is barbarously conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea, which not only endangers the Korean people, but also spreads bacteria to the world, causing harm to people all over the world. The Thai people cannot be safe if the United States wages bacteriological warfare. The Thai people demand a halt to the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea.
    The Thai government is known as the first government in Southeast Asia to send troops to Korea to fight alongside the US military. This is not the will of the people; the people have always opposed this. Many Thai soldiers have become cannon fodder, and the government has poured a large amount of manpower and resources, causing severe hunger and suffering to the people. Stopping the Korean War and withdrawing Thai troops are the unanimous demands of the Thai people.
    Since the Thai government participated in the "embargo," the price of rubber has dropped by more than 60% because it cannot be transported to the Soviet Union and China as before. Rubber is an important product of Thailand, accounting for the top spot in export taxes. The sharp drop in rubber prices has affected other businesses, and the vast majority of people have encountered difficulties, with a large number of workers losing their jobs and rubber plantation owners going bankrupt. The Thai people demand the lifting of the "embargo" and need trade between people of all countries under the principles of freedom and equality.
    At present, the US interference in Thailand and the Thai government's following the US in vigorously pursuing a policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war have threatened Thailand's independence and autonomy. Under the shackles of the US war policy, Thailand's economy has lost its independence. Under the government's war preparation policy, the people must bear an increasingly heavy economic burden. Thailand's territory is increasingly becoming a military base and granary for foreign warmongers. As a result, the economy is declining, taxes are increasing, the cost of living is rising, the people are becoming increasingly impoverished, and freedom and rights are being increasingly lost. The Thai people do not need to invade others, and at the same time, they oppose any invasion of Thailand.
    The Thai people long for Thailand to enjoy complete independence and freedom, without the rule and interference of foreign warmongers.
    For national independence, for a free and happy life, the Thai people have only one way out, which is to unite with the 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions to fight against the aggressors and defend the peace of Asia and the world.
    The Thai people are gradually realizing that fighting for peace is actually fighting for national independence, and it is actually fighting for a free and happy life. Fighting for peace is the task of the Thai people, which is consistent with the people of all countries.

    泰国代表、“泰声报”编辑
    ?素里·通哇匿的发言（摘要）
    我代表泰国一千八百万人民向诸位和平代表，并向表现出真正保卫和平的力量和作为发起召开这次具有历史意义的会议的大会主人中国政府及中国人民致最高的敬礼！
    泰国人民清楚地看到，在他们的国家周围，如在越南、寮国、高棉及马来亚，殖民主义者正在日益加紧地镇压人民解放运动。由于泰国有着丰富的资源，又是处于战略要地，美国乃不惜采取各种手段，按照其战争计划将泰国变成它发动侵略战争的基地。这种行为威胁了亚洲的和平。泰国人民要求和平，反对战争！
    美国所以与日本单独签订和约及签订军事协定，是为了要复活日本的军国主义，使日本变成美国的军事根据地，并以日本的军国主义为发动新战争的工具，这严重地威胁了世界和平，这对泰国是危险的。上次战争期间日本军国主义进占泰国造成了严重的灾难与困苦，这在泰国人民的记忆里还是很新的。泰国人民认识到要保证不使日本的军国主义复活，就需要对日本签订全面性质的和约，需要使日本有完整的独立与民主。
    人类数千年来对疾病进行了斗争，并逐步将其战胜。现在美国却野蛮地在朝鲜进行细菌战，这不仅是危害朝鲜人民，而且是把细菌传播给世界，使全世界人民遭受危害。美国进行细菌战，泰国人民就不能获得安全。泰国人民要求停止在朝鲜使用细菌武器。
    泰国政府是被称为东南亚第一个派遣军队往朝鲜与美军一同作战的政府。这并不是人民的意愿，人民从来就反对这件事。许多泰国士兵成了炮灰，政府倾出大量的人力和物力，造成人民严重的饥饿与苦难，停止朝鲜战争，撤回泰国军队，这是泰国人民的一致要求。
    自从泰国政府参加“禁运”以来，树胶价格降低了百分之六十以上，因为不能像以前那样运到苏联和中国去了。树胶是泰国一种重要产品，占出口税的首位。树胶价格如此下跌，其他商业也受了影响，广大人民遭遇到困难，大批工人失业，树胶园主破产。泰国人民要求取消“禁运”，需要各国人民在自由及平等原则下进行贸易。
    目前美国对泰国的干涉及泰国政府追随美国竭力进行扩军备战的政策，已威胁到泰国的独立自主。在美国战争政策的束缚下，泰国的经济已丧失了独立性。在政府备战政策下，人民必须担负日益沉重的经济负担。泰国的领土，日益变成外国战争贩子的军事基地和粮仓。结果造成经济日趋衰萎，捐税日益加重，生活费日益高涨，人民日益穷困，自由权利日益丧尽。泰国人民不需要侵略别人，同时也反对任何对泰国的侵略。
    泰国人民渴望泰国享有完全的独立自由，不需要外国战争贩子的统治与干涉。
    为了民族的独立，为了自由幸福的生活，泰国人民的出路只有一条，就是和亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民团结起来与侵略者进行斗争，保卫亚洲及世界的和平。
    泰国人民逐渐地知道了：为和平而斗争，实际上就是为民族的独立而斗争，实际上就是为自由幸福的生活而斗争。为和平斗争是泰国人民的任务，这和各国人民是一致的。         （新华社）
