Reflections on the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairman of the China Peace Committee

    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was not only pleasant but also enthusiastic; not only impassioned but also sincere. It was a manifestation of the peaceful aspirations of sixteen hundred million people, and also a manifestation of the aspirations of peace-loving people around the world. Despite different political systems, different religious beliefs, and different ways of life, the desire for peace was consistent, and the expression of peace was consistent.

    Why could it be so consistent? First of all, the people of some countries who have suffered from the disasters of Japanese imperialism still remember it vividly. The US imperialists are reviving Japanese militarism, causing Japan to return to the path of the former so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The people who have suffered from the disasters of Japanese imperialism will suffer again, of course, they must oppose it. The people of other countries who have not suffered from the disasters of Japanese imperialism, after hearing the speeches of the representatives of the countries that have suffered from the disasters of Japanese imperialism, as well as the accusations of the Korean representatives against the inhumane bombing and massacres by the US imperialists, as long as they are human, will oppose it. Opposing war, of course, requires peace.

    There are also some countries whose people have been affected by the deceptive propaganda of the US imperialists distorting the facts. When they have not been to the Soviet Union or China, they are still somewhat confused. Now that they have been to the Soviet Union and China, they know that the countries of the peace camp are working so hard for peaceful construction. They neither interfere with others nor allow others to interfere with themselves. All the lies of the US imperialists are self-defeating. It is very obvious that they are for the interests of a small group of monopoly capitalists who make money from arms. They attempt to launch wars, earn huge profits, and disturb the peace of the people all over the world. The burden on the people has increased, prices have risen, and will continue to rise; the living standards of the people have declined, and will continue to decline; the national capital enterprises have declined and even closed down, and the number of unemployed has increased. Preparedness for war has already brought such disasters; involvement in war is even more unimaginable. Everyone, of course, opposes war and demands peace.

    The most touching thing at the conference was that the US delegation presented a small tree to the Korean delegation headed by Han Xueye, and offered a poem saying: "We, the American people, praise courage and hate cruelty. We ask you to plant this small tree on the land of Korea, the land made sacred by the blood of the heroic people. May this small tree grow like the friendship between our two peoples..."

    While the British colonial government oppressed Malaya, the British people, Montague and Mrs. Felton, presented flowers to the Malayan representatives, expressing the support of the British people for the Malayan people's struggle for independence. The head of the Thai delegation, Mr. Basya Sasunthon, also presented gifts and flowers to the Korean representatives to pay their respects. The Thai representative declared in his dedication: "The Thai government was the first government in Asia to send troops to invade Korea, but this is a matter for the Thai government, it is not the will of the Thai people. We want to declare here firmly that we - the Thai people - have constantly resisted this unjust action and opposed the atrocities in Korea. We also want to declare that the Thai people love and sympathize with the Korean brothers very much; the Thai people are fighting to make the Thai government withdraw its troops from Korea." All this proves that the people of all countries recognize that aggression is a crime, and the people cannot protect the government that aggresses against others and must oppose such a government. The people of all countries sympathize with the struggle for independence and freedom. In sympathy, tears welled up, they shook hands and embraced each other, and everyone was moved.

    Another touching thing happened at the meeting: the Indian and Pakistani delegations issued a joint statement. The British and American imperialists used the outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, most notably the Kashmir issue, to deepen the conflict between the two countries in order to interfere in their internal affairs. Now the joint statement of the Indian and Pakistani delegations is paving the way for a just resolution of the Kashmir issue and other outstanding issues. These issues can and must be resolved peacefully. This is the best way to strike at the imperialists. Everyone understands that using peaceful means to solve problems between countries means that the imperialists will have no way to provoke war.

    During the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, China and Ceylon signed a trade agreement, achieving a preliminary economic exchange, which is also a happy event in the pursuit of peace.

    Through this Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, everyone has soberly united to oppose imperialist aggression, not to get involved in the vortex of war preparations, and to move towards the path of peace. Peace can be defended, and war can be avoided. As long as the people's forces are united, those plans to create war for aggression can be defeated. I celebrate the successful conclusion of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference!

    在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上的感言
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席　陈叔通
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，不仅是在愉快的，而且是热烈的；不仅是在激昂的，而且是诚挚的情绪中进行的；是十六亿人民和平愿望的表现；也是世界爱好和平人民的愿望的表现。尽管政治制度不同，宗教信仰不同，生活方式不同，而和平愿望是一致的，和平表现是一致的。
    为什么能够这样一致呢？首先是受过日本帝国主义灾难的一些国家的人民，至今日尚记忆犹新；美帝国主义者复活日本军国主义，使日本再回到以前所谓“大东亚共荣圈”的道路上去；这一些受过日本帝国主义灾难的人民，又要重受灾难，当然是要反对的。其余没有受过日本帝国主义灾难的人民，听到了受过日本帝国主义灾难的国家的代表的发言，以及朝鲜所控诉的美帝国主义者灭绝人道的轰炸、屠杀，只要是有人性的，没有不反对的；反对战争，当然要求和平。
    还有一些国家的人民，因为受了美帝国主义者歪曲事实的欺骗宣传所影响，当他们没有到过苏联，没有到过中国的时候，还有一些迷惑；现在到过苏联，到过中国以后，才知道和平阵营的国家，原来是这样努力和平建设，他们既不干涉别人，也不容许别人干涉自己。美帝国主义者的一切谎言，不攻自破；很显明的他们是为了一小撮靠军火发财的垄断资本家的利益，他们企图发动战争，赢得暴利，搅扰得全世界的人民不安。人民的负担加重了，物价提高了，还会不断的提高；人民的生活水平降低了，还会不断的降低；民族资本事业衰退乃至倒闭了，失业人数加多了。备战就已经带来了这样的灾害；卷入战争，更是不堪设想。大家当然反对战争，要求和平。
    会议中最足感动人的，就是美国代表团向以韩雪野为首的朝鲜代表团献一棵小树，并献词说：“我们美国人民，赞美勇敢，憎恨残暴；我们请求你们把这一棵小树，种在朝鲜土地上，那块因染上英雄人民的血而变得神圣的土地上。愿这棵小树像我们两国人民的友谊一般成长；……”
    英国殖民政府压迫马来亚，英国人民蒙塔古和费尔顿夫人，却向马来亚代表献花，表示英国人民支持马来亚人民为争取独立而进行的斗争。泰国代表团团长?巴色·飒顺吞也向朝鲜代表献礼献花致敬。泰国代表在献词中声明：“泰国政府是亚洲第一个派遣军队侵略朝鲜的政府，但是，这是泰国政府的事，它并不是泰国人民的意愿。我们要在这里坚决地声明，我们——泰国人民曾经不断地阻止这种不正义的行动，反对在朝鲜的暴行。我们同时还要声明，泰国人民非常热爱和同情朝鲜兄弟；泰国人民正在进行斗争，使泰国政府撤回在朝鲜的军队。”这一切都证明：各国人民认清了侵略是一种罪行，人民不能庇护侵略别人的政府而且要反对这种政府。各国人民对于争取独立自由是同情的；而且在同情中，涌出了热泪，互相握手，互相拥抱，任何人都受到感动。
    还有一件感人的事在会场出现：就是印度和巴基斯坦代表团发表了联合声明。英美帝国主义者，利用印巴两国间悬而未决的问题，最明显的是克什米尔问题，来加深两国间冲突，以便干涉他们的内政。现在印巴两国代表团的联合声明，就是为克什米尔问题和其他悬而未决的问题，得到公正的解决铺平道路；这些问题，都能够而且必需用和平方式来解决。这是打击帝国主义者最好的方法。大家都了解到用和平方式解决国与国间的问题，帝国主义者要想挑动战争，也就无从挑动了。
    正在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议举行期间，中国和锡兰签订了贸易协定，做到经济交流的初步，这也是要求和平中的一件喜事。
    经过这次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，大家都清醒地一致团结起来，反对帝国主义者侵略，不卷入备战的漩涡，向和平道路上走去。和平是可以保卫的，战争是可以避免的。只要人民的力量团结起来了，那些为侵略而制造战争的计划，是可以被击败的。我庆祝亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议胜利成功！
