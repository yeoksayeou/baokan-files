    Achievements in Northwest Ethnic Trade Work
    Dong Linzhe, Deputy Director of the Trade Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee
    Over the past three years, the development of ethnic trade work in the Northwest has embodied the people's government's policy of assisting ethnic minorities in developing their economies and strengthening ethnic unity. Due to the state-owned trade sector's organization of various economic forces, leadership in material exchange, and firm stabilization of prices, trade work in ethnic minority areas has become unprecedentedly active. This has greatly increased the income of farmers and herdsmen, raised their purchasing power, gradually improved their living standards, enhanced their enthusiasm for production, and promoted unity among various ethnic groups. From their personal experiences, ethnic minority people have recognized that only under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government can ethnic minorities truly move from poverty to prosperity and happiness, and therefore, they trust and support the Party and the People's Government even more.
    Because industry and commerce in ethnic minority areas are still underdeveloped, the development of material exchange in these areas has particular significance. From the liberation of the Northwest to the end of August this year, state-owned trade in the Northwest purchased more than 67 million catties of wool and down from pastoral areas, 5.48 million various hides, and more than 3 million casings, with a cumulative purchase and sale amount of 600 billion yuan, which could be exchanged for 2 million bolts of forty-yard cloth or 600 million catties of wheat. However, before liberation, under the blockade and plunder of the Kuomintang reactionaries, these valuable assets not only failed to alleviate the poverty of ethnic minorities but even brought them endless disasters. For example, Ma Bufang, a warlord in Qinghai, carried out multiple massacres against the people of the Golok area to plunder their cattle, sheep, hides, and wool.
    State-owned trade not only opened up sales channels for herdsmen's livestock products but also reasonably increased the prices of hides and wool. At the end of 1950, 100 catties of wool in Lanzhou could be exchanged for 2.48 bolts of fine cloth; at the end of 1951, it could be exchanged for 2.50 bolts; and in the third quarter of 1952, it could be exchanged for 3.13 bolts. At the end of 1950, 100 catties of camel hair in Yinchuan could be exchanged for 5.96 bolts of fine cloth; at the end of 1951, it could be exchanged for 6.08 bolts; and in the third quarter of 1952, it could be exchanged for 7.57 bolts. In the third quarter of 1950, 100 catties of wool in Xining could be exchanged for 2.57 bolts of fine cloth; at the end of 1951, it could be exchanged for 2.89 bolts; and in the third quarter of 1952, it could be exchanged for 3.30 bolts. At the end of 1950, 100 catties of autumn wool in Dihua could be exchanged for 1.42 bolts of fine cloth; in the third quarter of 1951, it could be exchanged for 1.60 bolts; and in the second quarter of 1952, it could be exchanged for 1.63 bolts. Compared with before liberation, the price of wool has increased by 6.5 to 48 times.
    Due to brisk sales and reasonable prices of hides and wool, the lives of ethnic minority people have undergone tremendous changes. According to statistics, the export of hides, wool, and local products from Xinjiang Province in 1952 will increase by 134% compared to 1950, and the import of industrial products will increase by 72.05%. There are more than 50,000 residents in Labrang, Gansu. In 1951, state-owned trade alone sold 30,000 bolts of cloth here, an average of more than six zhang per person. Tao Jiwa, a Tibetan in Guide, Qinghai, had a family of five. Before liberation, they could only buy three seals of tea and eat 900 catties of highland barley each year, and they wore old sheepskins all year round. After liberation, the whole family has bought five cotton robes made of twill fabric, twelve shirts, and two pairs of trousers. They drink nine seals of brick tea every year and can eat rice and noodles. They have also bought four new pots and other furniture. The significant improvement in the economic lives of ethnic minorities can also be seen from the continuous increase in the transaction volume of state-owned trade. For example, the average transaction volume per market day of the Nanba Trade Company in the Dongxiang Autonomous Region was 2 million yuan in October 1951, increasing to 12 million yuan by the end of the same year. During the "lean season" in May and June this year, the trade volume continued to rise, reaching 20 million yuan.
    With the development of material exchange, private industry and commerce have also moved from recession to prosperity. For example, in 1937, there were more than 400 industrial and commercial households in Guide, Qinghai. Only more than 100 households remained at the time of liberation, but now there are more than 500 households. Before liberation, there were only 217 industrial and commercial households in Labrang, Gansu, but now there are 845.
    To adapt to the characteristics of sparsely populated pastoral areas with inconvenient transportation, state-owned trade departments have established many fixed institutions in Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces, as well as many mobile trade teams. These mobile trade teams go deep into the mountains and grasslands to serve ethnic minorities directly. Luo Muzang, a Tibetan in Jianzha District, Qinghai, said gratefully, "In the past, several packloads of wool could only be exchanged for one packload of tea when going to Guide. Today, the trade company comes to our yurt, and one packload of wool can be exchanged for one packload of tea."
    The sales personnel sent by the trade company are welcomed and cared for by ethnic minority people everywhere. For example, the herdsmen of the Xiabu Rang and Gonggong Ma tribes in Qinghai voluntarily formed self-defense teams to help the company's personnel stand guard and protect materials. To increase wool production, the state-owned trade company implemented a policy of grading and pricing and vigorously promoted the washing and shearing methods for sheep and camel wool. The purity of Qinghai wool has increased from 87% last year to more than 90%. Ethnic minority people unanimously reflect: "It is right to listen to the trade company."
    To guide private merchants to better engage in material exchange in ethnic minority areas, state-owned trade companies have provided private merchants with guidance and assistance in various ways. Local state-owned trade mobile teams often work with private merchants to conduct transactions in pastoral areas, on the one hand, ensuring that private merchants obtain reasonable profits higher than those in the interior, and on the other hand, educating private merchants to change their past illegal behaviors of deception, fraud, and adulteration, which has strengthened the activities of private merchants in fraternal ethnic areas.
    In ethnic minority areas, state-owned trade companies not only conduct purchasing and sales business but also carry out publicity and education work at any time, greatly improving the political awareness of farmers and herdsmen. When purchasing wool in the Keping pastoral area of Xinjiang, the trade company cadres promoted the principle of loving the country and protecting livestock. The local people proposed: "Grow more pasture to ensure strong cattle and fat sheep, to strengthen the power to resist America and aid Korea." Correct trade policies and effective political education have further eliminated the long-standing estrangement between the Han and Tibetan people and strengthened the unity of all ethnic groups in our country.
    The achievement of the above results is primarily due to our conscientious implementation of the ethnic policy of equality and unity and the trade policy of fairness and reason. Over the past three years, state-owned trade companies in various regions have proceeded from this principle in both mass relations and purchasing and sales business. Tea is a necessity for the lives of ethnic minorities in the Northwest. Historically, the ruling class established the so-called "official tea" system, implemented "tea-horse trade," manipulated tea prices, and monopolized the tea market to achieve their goal of exploiting ethnic minorities. After liberation, state-owned trade has done everything possible to meet the needs of ethnic minority people for tea. From April 1950 to August this year, a total of more than 6 million catties of tea were supplied, and prices were appropriately reduced. Taking black brick tea, which is favored by the Uygur and Mongolian people, as an example. In 1950, each piece was 26,000 yuan (Xi'an listed price, same below); in the spring of 1951, it was reduced to 23,000 yuan, and this year it was further reduced to 20,000 yuan. Before liberation, 100 catties of wool in Xining could only be exchanged for one and a half seals of Fu brick tea, but in September this year, it can be exchanged for more than thirty-six seals.
    Secondly, it is due to our reliance on the strong support and leadership of local Party and government organs. The public security departments in many places have provided great help to the mobile trade teams of state-owned trade departments. The example of Comrade Gong Fuheng, secretary of the CPC Tongde County Committee in Qinghai, personally mobilizing herdsmen to organize transportation teams to help the trade company transport goods, is a very good one.
    The selfless work spirit of trade cadres is also an indispensable condition for the smooth development of ethnic trade work. The Bole Trade Team in Xinjiang followed the Kazakh people to Xiawozi for trade in the summer and to Dongwozi in the winter. Wu Huaibin, manager of the Dulan Trade Company in Qinghai, lost his way in the mountains from Lacang to Wuji while working in ethnic minority areas. He had no food to eat at the time and ate horse feed raw for four days. The cadres of the Kebai'er, Yabulai, and Ejina Banner Damiao trade teams in Ningxia cooked their own meals and chopped their own firewood after work, but they had no complaints and immersed themselves in the trade work of ethnic minorities. Over the past three years, we have absorbed and trained more than 1,000 ethnic minority cadres to engage in trade work. They are conscientious, responsible, and hardworking, and have played a huge role in developing trade work in ethnic minority areas.

    西北民族贸易工作的成就
    西北军政委员会贸易部副部长　董林哲
    三年来，西北民族贸易工作的开展，体现了人民政府帮助少数民族发展经济与加强民族团结的政策。由于国营贸易部门组织各种经济力量，领导物资交流，坚决稳定物价，已使少数民族地区的贸易工作空前活跃起来，大大增加了农牧民的收入，提高了农牧民的购买力，逐步改善了农牧民的生活，提高了农牧民生产的积极性，促进了各民族之间的团结。少数民族人民从切身体验中，认识了只有在共产党、毛主席、人民政府的领导下，少数民族才能真正由贫穷走向富裕、幸福，因而更加信任与拥护党和人民政府。
    由于少数民族地区的工商业还很不发达，因此，在少数民族地区开展物资交流就有其特别重要的意义。从西北解放至今年八月底，西北国营贸易共收购牧区绒毛六千七百多万斤，各种皮子五百四十八万张，肠衣三百多万根，历年收购、投放累计金额达六千亿元，可交换四十码大布二百万匹或小麦六亿斤。但是，在解放以前，在国民党反动派的封锁掠夺下，这些宝贵的财富不仅不能解救少数民族的贫困，甚至还给他们带来无穷的灾害。例如，青海马匪步芳为了掠夺果洛牧区的牛羊皮毛，就对果洛区人民实行过多次的屠杀。
    国营贸易不但为牧民的畜产品开辟了销路，而且合理地提高了皮毛的价格。一九五○年底，兰州每百斤羊毛可换二点四八匹细布，一九五一年底可换二点五○匹，一九五二年第三季度已可换三点一三匹；一九五○年底银川每百斤驼毛可换五点九六匹细布，一九五一年底可换六点○八匹，一九五二年第三季度可换七点五七匹；一九五○年第三季度西宁每百斤羊毛可换二点五七匹细布，一九五一年底可换二点八九匹，一九五二年第三季度可换三点三○匹；一九五○年底迪化每百斤秋毛可换一点四二匹细布，一九五一年第三季度可换一点六○匹，一九五二年第二季度可换一点六三匹。与解放前比，羊毛价格提高了六倍半至四十八倍。
    由于皮毛畅销且价格合理，这就使少数民族人民的生活发生了巨大的变化。据统计：新疆一省外销的皮毛、土产，一九五二年将比一九五○年增加百分之一三四，进口的工业品可增加百分之七二点○五；甘肃拉卜楞居民有五万多人，一九五一年仅国营贸易就在这里销布三万匹，平均每人可买六丈多。青海贵德藏民道吉娃，全家五口人，解放前每年最多能买三封茶，吃九百斤青稞，冬夏都是穿一身老羊皮，解放后全家已经买了五件斜纹布棉袍，十二件衬衣，两条裤子，每年喝九封茯茶，并且能吃大米和挂面；她家还买了四口新锅，及其他家具。少数民族经济生活显著上升的情况，还可从国营贸易交易额的不断增加得到证明。例如东乡自治区销南坝贸易公司每集平均交易额，一九五一年十月为二百万元，同年年底增至一千二百万元。到今年五、六月间“青黄不接”的时候，贸易额还在继续上升，直增至两千万元。
    随着物资交流的发展，私人工商业也由萧条走向繁荣。例如，一九三七年，青海贵德原有工商业四百多户，解放时只剩下一百多户，现在已发展到五百多户。甘肃拉卜楞解放前只有工商业二百一十七户，现在已增至八百四十五户。
    为了适应牧区地广人稀、交通不便的特点，国营贸易部门除在甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆各省建立了很多固定机构外，还建立了许多流动贸易小组。这些流动贸易小组深入山区、草原，直接为少数民族服务。青海尖札区藏民罗木藏感激地说：“过去走到贵德，几驮羊毛换一驮茶，今天贸易公司走到我们的帐房，一驮羊毛换一驮茶。”
    贸易公司派出的售货人员，到处受到少数民族人民的欢迎与爱护。例如，青海夏卜让、工贡麻两部落的牧民，自动成立了自卫队，帮助公司的人员放哨站岗，保护物资；国营贸易公司为提高绒毛产量，实行了分等论价的政策，并大力宣传羊毛、驼毛剪洗法。青海羊毛的纯度已由去年的百分之八十七提高到百分之九十以上，少数民族人民一致反映：“听贸易公司的话没有错。”
    为了领导私商更好地从事少数民族地区的物资交流工作，国营贸易公司曾多方给私商以指导与协助。各地国营贸易流动小组经常会同私商，深入牧区进行交易，一方面保证私商取得较内地为高的合理利润，一方面教育私商改变过去欺骗哄诈，掺杂作伪的非法行为，这就加强了私商在兄弟民族地区的活动。
    国营贸易公司在少数民族地区不仅进行购销业务，而且随时开展宣传教育工作，大大提高了农牧民的政治觉悟。新疆柯坪牧区贸易公司干部在收购羊毛的时候，宣传爱国保畜的道理，当地群众纷纷提出：“多打牧草，保证牛壮羊肥，以加强抗美援朝力量”。正确的贸易政策和有力的政治教育，进一步消除了汉藏人民历史上长期存在的隔阂，加强了我国各民族的团结。
    以上成绩的取得，首先是由于我们认真执行了平等团结的民族政策与公平合理的贸易政策。三年来，各地国营贸易公司无论在群众关系上，在购销业务上，都是从这一原则出发的。茶叶是西北少数民族生活必需品，历史上的统治阶级建立了所谓“官茶”制度，实行“茶马交易”，操纵茶价，垄断茶叶市场，以达其剥削少数民族之目的。解放以后，国营贸易即尽一切可能，满足少数民族人民对于茶叶的需要，从一九五○年四月至今年八月，共供应茶叶六百多万斤，并适当地降低了价格。以维吾尔族、蒙族人民爱好的黑砖茶为例。一九五○年每片为二万六千元（西安牌价，下同），一九五一年春降至二万三千元，今年再降至二万元；解放前西宁羊毛百斤仅换茯茶一封半，今年九月能换三十六封多。
    其次是由于我们依靠了当地党政机关的有力支持和领导。很多地方的公安部门给予国营贸易部门的流动贸易小组以很大的帮助。中共青海同德县委书记龚福恒同志亲自发动牧民组织运输队，帮助贸易公司运输货物，都是很好的例子。
    贸易干部忘我工作的精神，也是民族贸易工作顺利开展不可缺少的条件。新疆博乐贸易小组夏天随哈萨克族人民到夏窝子进行贸易，冬天又随着到冬窝子进行贸易；青海都兰贸易公司经理吴怀斌在少数民族地区进行工作，曾在拉苍到吾吉的山中迷失了方向，当时没有饭吃，生吃四天马料；宁夏阿拉善旗科白尔、亚布赖以及额济纳旗大庙贸易组的干部，在工作之后自己做饭，自己打柴，但他们毫无怨言，埋头做少数民族的贸易工作。三年以来，我们吸收、培养了一千多个少数民族干部，从事贸易工作的。他们认真负责、吃苦耐劳，对开展少数民族地区的贸易工作，发挥了巨大的作用。
