The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, have been living a new life of freedom and liberation for the past three years. Liang Rong, a farmer in Nangangwa Village, Liangxiang County, Hebei Province, like all farmers in the country, is living a better life day by day. He was an old farmer who suffered greatly in the old China. When he recalled the life before liberation, he said: "At that time, life at home was very hard. My grandson (referring to Liang Run) went out to be an apprentice. If we didn't sell vegetables for a day, we wouldn't have anything to cook! Now, the new China has brought us a new life." Let's take a look at the life of Liang Rong's family! After liberation, he bought a mule, and the People's Government lent him a waterwheel. He also joined a mutual aid team, which made his family's agricultural production better year by year. At the same time, coupled with the wages of his grandson Liang Run, who works in a railway factory, the family can often eat white flour, and there are often a few pieces of new clothing material in the box. His grandson and great-granddaughter are also going to school. Liang Rong's family members are all activists in various works and movements. In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, they reported two counter-revolutionaries; in the implementation of the Marriage Law, in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and other works, they were active participants. From the family life of Liang Rong, we can see the significant changes in the political, economic, and cultural lives of the people in the new China over the past three years.

	After liberation, Liang Rong bought a mule, and the People's Government lent him a waterwheel. Liang Rong said: "In the past, I had to water the garden myself, but now I don't need to water the garden."

	Liang Jiang, Liang Rong's youngest grandson, only started school after liberation. During the autumn break, in addition to reviewing his lessons, he also helped the family raise pigs and develop sideline production.

	Liang Wenyu, Liang Rong's son, like all working farmers in our country, actively engages in agricultural production. Look, he just came back from selling vegetables and is now harvesting his plump corn in the field.

	This year, agricultural production has generally been a bumper harvest throughout the country, and the crops grown by Liang Rong's family have also yielded very well. Liang Rong said while picking winter melon in his vegetable garden: "This year, my six acres of vegetable garden have yielded four or five times more than last year."

	The material living standards of the liberated farmers of the new China have gradually improved. Liang Rong's daughter-in-law said: "Before liberation, we couldn't even afford coarse grains. Now, our whole family can often eat white flour."

	The factory where Liang Run works, like all factories, mines, and enterprises across the country, has launched a warm campaign to increase production and practice economy. Liang Run often goes to the workers to understand the situation of the increase production and practice economy campaign.

	Liang Rong's grandson, Liang Run, was originally a fitter in the Changxindian Railway Factory. Because of his active and responsible work, he was promoted to technical quota setter. After the "Three-Anti" movement, he was transferred to the Increase Production and Practice Economy Office.

	Liang Rong's family has made five or six new sets of clothes this year. With the National Day approaching, Wang Huizhen is cutting new clothes for her daughter Jihua.

	Liang Zhenmin, after her own choice, is in love with Wang Fengshan, the instructor of a volunteer army unit. She is happily reading the letter from Wang Fengshan from the Korean front to her mother.

	Liang Rong's granddaughter, Liang Zhenmin, is the secretary of the Youth League branch in the village. She has played an active leading role in various works by leading the Youth League members in the whole village. This is her encouraging a young couple to fight against feudal parents for their own marriage autonomy.

	Every time Liang Run comes home, he earnestly teaches his wife Wang Huizhen to learn culture.

    新中国给我们带来了新的生活
    三年来一个普通农民家庭生活的变化
    我国人民三年来在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，过着自由解放的新生活。河北省良乡县南岗洼村农民梁荣，和全国所有的农民一样过着一天比一天好的光景。他曾是一个饱受旧中国痛苦的老农民，当他回忆起解放前的生活时说：“那时，家里的生活非常苦，孙子（指梁润）出去当学徒。一天不卖青菜就揭不开锅盖！现在，新中国给我们带来了新的生活。”我们看看梁荣家庭的生活吧！在解放后，他买了一头骡子，人民政府贷给他一辆水车，又参加了互助组，使他家的农业生产一年比一年好。同时，再加上他的在铁路工厂工作的孙儿梁润的工资，家里可以经常吃白面，箱子里常存有几块新衣服料子。孙子和曾孙女也都上学读书了。梁荣全家在各种工作、运动中，都是积极分子。在镇压反革命运动中，检举了两个反革命分子；在执行婚姻法中、在抗美援朝运动和其他工作中，都是积极的参加者。从梁荣的家庭生活里，我们可以看出新中国的人民三年来在政治、经济、文化等各方面生活上的显著变化。
    解放后，梁荣买了一头骡子，人民政府又贷给他一辆水车。梁荣说：“过去都是我浇园，现在用不着我浇园了。”
    梁荣的小孙子梁江，解放后才开始上学。秋假里他除了温习功课以外，还帮助家里放猪，发展副业生产。
    梁荣的儿子梁文郁和我国一切劳动的农民一样，积极从事农业生产。你看，他刚卖完青菜回来，就又在地里收他的颗粒饱满的玉米。
    今年全国各地农业生产品普遍丰收，梁荣家所种的作物收成也很好。梁荣在他的菜园子里摘冬瓜时说：“今年我这六亩菜园子又比去年多收四、五成。”
     翻身了的新中国的农民，物质生活水平都渐渐提高了。梁荣的儿媳妇说：“解放前连粗粮都吃不上，现在我们全家可以经常吃到白面了。”
    梁润所在的工厂，和全国各工厂、矿山、企业一样展开了热烈的增产节约竞赛运动。梁润时常到工人中去了解增产节约竞赛的情况。
    梁荣的孙儿梁润原来是长辛店铁路工厂的钳工，由于他工作积极负责，被提升为技术定额员，“三反”运动后，又调到增产节约办公室工作。
    梁荣家今年来已经做了五六套新衣服。国庆节到了，王惠珍又在给女儿冀华裁新衣服。
    梁振民经过自己的选择，和志愿军某部的指导员王凤山在恋爱。她正高兴地把王凤山从朝鲜前线的来信念给她妈妈听。
    梁荣的孙女梁振民是青年团村支部书记。她领导全村青年团员在各种工作中都起了积极带头作用。这是她正在鼓励一对青年为他们自己的婚姻自主向封建家长进行斗争。   
    梁润每次回家来，都认真地教他的老婆王惠珍学文化。
