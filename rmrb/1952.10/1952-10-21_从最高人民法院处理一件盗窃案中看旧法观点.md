	Seeing Old Legal Viewpoints from the Supreme People's Court's Handling of a Theft Case

	Editor: I am exposing an erroneous judgment by the Supreme People's Court that is permeated with old legal viewpoints. In 1950, thieves Wei Guoli and Shi Wenyuan, colluding with "middleman" Diao Qinglu and others, sold public power lines, which they had stolen seven times in a certain area, amounting to 6,000 meters of copper wire and 5,300 meters of telephone wire, at a low price to Yu Jinwu, the manager of Beijing Daming Electric Wire Factory, who was in collusion with them. The criminals Wei, etc., loaded the wires into a large basket, covered it with firewood, and pulled it to the Daming Electric Wire Factory on a raft-cart, where it was pulled in through the back door of the factory. After the factory bought it, it used a fake person's name to record the transaction and report taxes. This is, in essence, a case of sabotaging economic construction and disrupting transportation. Standing on the position of the working class, standing on the position of safeguarding national economic construction, we must wage a resolute struggle against this kind of crime that endangers the interests of the country and the people. The Beijing Municipal People's Court sentenced the criminals Wei Guoli, Yu Jinwu, and others to imprisonment, and recovered all the copper wire and telephone wire purchased by Yu Jinwu. In order to cover up his crime, Yu Jinwu colluded with a black lawyer, fabricated reasons, and claimed that he had "mistakenly bought stolen goods," and appealed to the Supreme People's Court. An old judicial officer of the Supreme People's Court who handled the case changed the essence of the case, turning the crime of奸商 (corrupt merchant) colluding with habitual thieves to repeatedly sabotage national transportation construction into an ordinary "negligent purchase of stolen goods." He did not investigate or study the various important links of the case, such as long-term planned collusion, low-price stealth purchases, disguised vehicles, and false name accounting and tax reporting, and ignored these materials. On the other hand, he subjectively deduced that: "It is certainly not possible to infer his knowledge of the intentional purchase of stolen goods simply because he pulled the stolen goods in through this door (referring to the back door)." He also said: "...Single-strand copper wire without an outer skin, new and old, is indeed not easy to distinguish, and this cannot be used to infer his knowledge." He also said: "He should be considered as having failed to pay attention when he could have, and is responsible for the crime of negligently buying stolen goods."

	I hope that the Supreme People's Court and the people's judicial organs in various places will take the above-mentioned case as a lesson and thoroughly examine the old legal viewpoints in this judicial reform movement.

### 从最高人民法院处理一件盗窃案中看旧法观点

    从最高人民法院处理一件盗窃案中看旧法观点
    编辑同志：我揭发最高人民法院浸透了旧法观点的一个错误判决。一九五○年，偷割电线罪犯魏国立、史文元勾结“中间人”刁庆禄等，以低价把在某地先后七次偷割的公家电线计电铜线六千公尺、电话线五千三百公尺，卖给和他们勾结好的北京大明电线厂经理余谨吾。魏犯等把电线装在一个大筐里，上盖劈柴，用排子车拉到大明电线厂，由该厂后门拉进去。该厂买到后，用个假人名记账报税。这在本质上是破坏经济建设、破坏交通的案件。若站在工人阶级立场，站在保卫国家经济建设的立场，必须和这种危害国家人民利益的罪行作坚决的斗争。北京市人民法院对魏国立余谨吾等犯分别判处徒刑，并追缴余谨吾所收买的全部电铜线、电话线。余谨吾为了蒙混他的罪行，便勾结黑律师，捏造理由，说自己是“误买贼赃”，向最高人民法院上诉。最高人民法院承办该案的一个旧司法人员，改变了案情的本质，把奸商勾结惯盗累次破坏国家交通建设的罪行变为普通的“过失买赃”。他对案情的各个重要环节，如长期有计划的勾结、低价偷买、伪装车子、造假名记账报税等都不调查研究，不理会这些材料。另一方面，却主观主义地推断说：“固不能以其由此门（指后门）拉进赃物推断其知情故买。”又说：“……无外皮的独股铜丝，新旧确不易辨别，也不能以此推断其知情。”又说：“自属能注意而不注意，负有过失收买赃物的罪责。”
    我希望最高人民法院及各地人民司法机关，在这次司法改革运动中，都以上述案件为借镜，好好检查一下旧法观点。周珏
