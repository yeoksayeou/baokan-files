    Two Small Things
    Shuài Yuēzhī
    In August of this year, I took a trip from the north to the south. Two small things I encountered during the journey have stayed with me for a very, very long time.
    1. I Doubted My Ears
    Before setting off, I went to the Beijing Railway Station to inquire about the departure times of the Beijing-Hankou express train. A comrade at the station told me, "It departs at 12:50 PM and arrives at 7:19 PM the next day." I walked away satisfied at the time. But back home, I thought, something's not right. I've traveled the Beijing-Hankou Railway many times, and it always took around 40 hours. Even the fastest record before the War of Resistance Against Japan was 36 hours. Now, from noon today to dusk tomorrow, it's only 30 hours. It can't be that fast! I doubted that I had heard correctly. This doubt didn't disappear until I boarded the train. We left Beijing at noon on August 2nd and arrived in Hankou at 7:19 PM on the 3rd, not a minute off. Reducing the journey from around 40 hours to 30 hours may seem like a small thing. But I calculated carefully: on this more than two thousand li long Beijing-Hankou Railway, the travel time has been shortened by nearly a quarter. The vehicles saved are enough for a railway line five or six hundred li long. How much wealth this saves the country every year! The thousands upon thousands of travelers on the Beijing-Hankou route not only reduce travel fatigue by several hours on each trip but also save time. Imagine how much wealth and work this time can create for the country in a year!
    I stood on the platform of Hankou Station, gazing at the train we had just arrived on for a long time, lost in thought. I couldn't help but shout in my heart: Long live the great working class!
    2. Blind Elder
    At Wuchang Station, I was waiting for the express train heading towards Guangdong. At a little after 11 PM, I and many other passengers lined up to enter the station. I arrived early, second in line among the ordinary passengers. Just as we were about to enter, a guide at the station led three people quickly towards where I was standing. He waved at us, asking us to step back, meaning to let the tall one among the three stand at the very front of the line. I was very surprised, feeling that the guide shouldn't be disrupting the order of his own station. The passenger behind me was also displeased: "Why should those who come later be ahead of us?" This is the order of the masses, and no one is allowed to disrupt it. But in that instant, the light shone on the tall man's face, and people immediately quieted down. Everyone moved back a step in unison, giving him the first position. It turned out he was an old man blind in both eyes, being supported by two people. When entering the station, the train attendant immediately came to help him onto the train and said to his two companions, "Rest assured and go back, we will take careful care of everything." The old man sat not far from me. Along the way, I saw the attendants and other passengers giving him much help.
    Upon arriving in Yuezhou, the old man was about to get off the train. Among the disembarking passengers, a young man with a white towel wrapped around his head volunteered to take him home.
    The blind elder happily walked away, leaning on this unfamiliar young man. I watched them until they disappeared from sight, tears welling up in my eyes. Oh, my beloved motherland! In your warm embrace, each of us can walk around freely, and even an elderly person blind in both eyes doesn't have to worry about being left unattended once they leave their home.

    两件小事
    帅约之
    今年八月，我从北方到南方去了一趟。旅途中遇到的两件小事，使我很久很久不能忘掉。
    一、怀疑我的耳朵了
    我在启程之前，曾到北京车站去打听京汉快车的车行时刻。车站的同志告诉我：“中午十二点五十分开，第二天下午七点十九分到。”当时我满意地走开了。回到家里一想，不对，京汉路我走过多次了，一向是要花四十小时左右。抗日战争以前的最快纪录也要三十六小时。现在，从今天中午到明天傍晚，只有三十小时。没这么快吧！我怀疑是我听错了。一直到我坐上火车以后，这个怀疑才消失。八月二日中午离开北京，三日下午七点十九分到汉口，一分也不差。从四十小时左右减少到三十小时，看起来事情不大。但是我仔细算了一算：在这两千多里长的京汉路上，行车时间缩短了将近四分之一，它所节省下来的车辆，就够一条五、六百里长的铁路之用了。这每年要给国家节省多少财富！往来京汉道上的成千成万的旅客，每个人在一次旅行中不独减少几小时的旅途疲劳，还节约出来了时间。试想，这些时间一年中能给国家创造多少财富、做多少工作！
    我站在汉口车站的月台上，望着我们刚坐来的火车出了半天神。我不禁在心里呼喊：伟大的工人阶级万岁！
    二、盲目老人
    在武昌车站，我等候开往广东方面去的快车。午夜十一点多钟，我和许多旅客排队进站。我到得早，在普通旅客中排第二个。将要进站了，忽然，站上向导员引着三个人从旁边向我站的地方疾进，他向我们挥手，请我们退一步，意思要让那三个人当中的一个高个子站在旅客的最前面。我心中很奇怪，觉得向导员不该自己破坏自己车站的秩序。站在我后面的旅客也不服气：“后来的为什么反排在前头？”这是群众的秩序，不容许任何人破坏的。但是就在这一瞬间，灯光照在那高个子的脸上，人们立刻安静下来了。大家不约而同地都往后移动一步，让出了第一个位置给他。原来他是一个双目失明的老汉，两个人扶着他走来的。进站的时候，车上的乘务员立刻就来扶他上车，并且对他的两个同伴说：“你们放心回去，一切我们都会仔细照料的。”那老汉就坐在离我不远的地方。一路上我看见乘务员和其他旅客给他许多帮助。
    到了岳州，老汉要下车了。下车的旅客丛中，有一位头扎白毛巾的年青人自告奋勇答应送他回家。
    盲目老人扶着这位陌生的青年愉快地走了。我一直目送他们到看不见的地方，我的眼睛里涌起了泪水。亲爱的祖国啊！在你的温暖的怀抱里，我们每个人都可以自由地走来走去，即使是一个双目失明的老者，也用不着耽心出了门没人照应。
