Only in a meeting like this, where true representatives of the people gather together, can a small country like Ecuador freely voice its opinion, unafraid of official lies and the oppression of the powerful. Therefore, Ecuador congratulates this great platform, built by the will of sixteen hundred million people from thirty-seven countries, where representatives demonstrate their determination to fight for the defense of humanity and life; to overcome the obstacles placed before us by those who seek to incite war and prevent us from reaching an agreement.

The Ecuadorian delegation had to overcome many difficulties to come here, to expose the clamoring of its rulers to the world, and to tell the Korean people and the people of the world: If our government has ever sent supplies to aid aggression, then our people have sent us to shake your hands and tell you that our greatest wish is to live and work together in peace, and to cooperate with all countries of the world.

We also congratulate the heroic Chinese people and their wise leaders, who, despite all the malicious slanders of those who intend to attack them, resolutely demonstrated their willingness to strive for peace, convened this conference, and brought us together to know and understand each other, while proving that in an atmosphere of peace, the people of all countries can live together. For Latin America, and especially for Ecuador, this direct contact with the Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries is of the utmost importance and profound significance. In fact, our connection is not only due to being located on the Pacific Ocean and our common desire for peace, but also because we originally had very close relations and face the same problems. That is to say, the experience and achievements of building a new China are of inestimable importance to us.

For most Pacific coastal countries, such as the countries of Latin America, the struggle for peace is closely linked to the struggle for national independence. The imperialist bloc's war policy is making our countries' dependent status increasingly lower, and some agreements and treaties recently signed by the government without the consent of the people and against their interests have placed these countries under colonial rule. The struggle against this system is growing vigorously in Latin America. This struggle has reached the stage of armed action in some parts of the Pacific, such as Vietnam, Malaya, Laos, and Cambodia. These countries are all under imperialist attack, and imperialism is desperately struggling to maintain its dominant position, attempting to crush the heroic liberation movements of the people of these countries. Ecuador pays tribute to the people of these countries because they are fearlessly saving peace and the independence of all countries in the world.

This policy of colonial rule is manifested in its most dangerous form in the so-called "Peace Treaty with Japan" and the "US-Japan Security Treaty" signed in San Francisco. It is also manifested in the subsequent "Administrative Agreement," which actually turned Japan into a colony, forced it to accept the permanent stationing of foreign occupation forces, the cession of military bases, and the supply of cannon fodder for aggression. This situation, similar to that of Latin American countries, is of particular importance—if we remember that imperialism is trying to make Japan the main base for attacking the Asian people. For this purpose, on the one hand, the Yoshida government and the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime signed the so-called "Treaty of Peace between the Republic of China and Japan," and on the other hand, imperialism used all means to re-militarize Japan, preparing it for large-scale armed aggression, and launching an offensive against the real People's Republic of China with the help of the traitorous Kuomintang. The peaceful construction of this China is already known to the representatives and observers from all over the world. It was this group of Japanese leaders who once said: "The United States hopes that Japan will lead Asia," and they have expressed considerable approval of this statement, which is reflected in their attempt to privatize the Pacific, which is the greatest crisis for both Asia and the Americas. This attempt implicitly requires the occupation of the Galapagos Islands, which belong to Ecuador, because they occupy a strategic position in our common ocean. Therefore, we believe that the presence of the Japanese delegation at this meeting, representing the Japanese people's heroic and resolute struggle against rearmament and war, signifies the rebirth of a free Japan rather than its demise. A free Japan is the strongest guarantee of world peace.

However, this struggle against re-militarization is the task of the people of all countries, because if Japan's militarization is allowed to develop freely, then it will be difficult to avoid war, and it will be almost impossible to improve the poor living conditions of the Latin American people, because if a conflict occurs, the dependence of these countries will be even greater than before.

The Korean issue is a terrifying rehearsal for World War III, in which one can see what kind of vicious weapons will be used in the future, and how enormous sacrifices have already been caused by the emergence of these weapons. Imperialism tried to make Latin America send soldiers to be vanguards in the aggression against the Korean people, and to destroy their own way of life. The representatives of our Latin American governments in the United Nations, against our will, put forward some "generous" assistance; but they did not achieve the success they expected. They sent only a battalion from Puerto Rico to carry out the massacre, whose status, although said to be a "freely associated state," is actually a colony of the United States; and a battalion of soldiers from Colombia, who have paid the price of their lives for interfering in other countries. To protest strongly against this interference, the peace movement is being promoted more and more by the people.

But there are other ways of cooperation. For example, when the government of Ecuador discovered that it could not mobilize us to participate in such an unpopular war, it shipped two million pounds of rice to supply the troops of foreign aggressors. This rice is the basic food of our people, and it originally belonged to the people of Ecuador, stolen from them because they produced it, because they urgently needed it, and even more because they did not go to another continent to kill their brothers. Using the Korean issue as an excuse, and also using the fictitious danger of aggression from outside the Americas as an excuse, our country's policy of preparing for war is being strengthened, and our economy is being enslaved, all of which seriously harms the interests of the people. The people of Ecuador understand this, so they declared their opposition to interfering in Korea and their opposition to their government providing assistance to this behavior. The government had no right to provide this assistance, which brought the greatest suffering to the poor families of working people.

Especially after the aggression against Korea, the US government and the governments of the Latin American republics hurriedly signed and ratified military agreements and those so-called bilateral agreements of mutual assistance. Fearing that small Latin American countries would unite at a Pan-American conference as they had in the past to refuse to sign agreements, the United States signed agreements with them separately. Under the pressure of public opinion, the governments of Guatemala and Mexico strongly opposed the signing of such military agreements. The conclusion of these agreements is the most hateful act of treason, and the most fatal blow to our country's independence and autonomy. The conclusion of these agreements allows foreign troops to occupy our territory—Ecuador has already had this painful experience. Cape Santa Elena and the Galapagos Islands were occupied as military bases, and it was only after four years after the end of the war, after the people's unyielding struggle, that this occupation could be lifted; before the occupying forces withdrew, they completely destroyed all the machines that they could not take away. Not only that, they also approved the plan to unify the armed forces, which was approved in Rio de Janeiro and subsequently passed at the Bogotá Conference. According to this plan, the armed forces of Ecuador and other Latin American republics do not belong to their own countries, but are under the command of US military missions. Not only that, they also want to force these countries to submit to the US security law and its amendments and addenda, thus undermining some of the express provisions in the constitutions of these republics, according to which only laws proposed and approved by the national parliament are legal and valid.

Under the pressure of imperialism, Ecuador's economy has been destroyed, leaving it in a feudal and backward mode of production, thus preventing the mechanization of its agriculture and industrial development. This makes our country merely a source of raw materials and a market for finished products, the prices of which, as a result of monopolies, are completely arbitrarily determined by the ruling country. The result is naturally a low national income, an increasingly unbalanced balance of payments, and a similarly lowered standard of living for the people, especially the domestic working people. In this way, our economy is determined by foreign countries and becomes a vassal of the US economy, which forces us to adopt a highly harmful monoculture system, and makes us encounter crises and unemployment, the number of which is getting higher and higher, as a result of the periodic crises of super-capitalist economies.

On the other hand, the plight of ordinary people in our country is getting worse and worse because military spending in Latin America is constantly increasing, as I said above, which is a direct consequence of direct economic relations with the US military. In this way, the funding for social undertakings, such as education, health and public utilities, is reduced.

Foreign trade has been almost entirely monopolized since World War II, although before the war we maintained considerable trade relations with European and Asian countries, including China. This kind of trade is indispensable and extremely important to our country's economy and to restoring relations with the friendly people of China. The consequences of this monopoly are worsening because the signing of the Pacific Pact has erected a barrier for Latin America that is unfavorable to industry and commerce in Asia (including Japan). Therefore, we declare our opposition to blockades and economic encirclements that strangle other countries, which is in line with the true interests of the people of Ecuador.

This is also related to the US policy of loans to Ecuador. The terms of the loans are extremely harsh for us, simply selling out the future of our descendants. Under the false name of "assistance," it is nothing more than enslavement. Some technical missions are sent to our country, and in reality they want to consume most of the loans by paying salaries. At the same time, they compiled a detailed list of our production potential, the purpose of which is to use these resources later to achieve strategic goals. They depreciate the value of our country's genuine technical personnel, but secretly carry out inconspicuous espionage activities, colluding with foreign police agencies that have long existed in Ecuador. The purpose of this military agreement is to force us not only to supply personnel, but also to hand over all our economic resources, while allowing the United States to import goods to supply "military personnel of diplomatic missions" duty-free, which will make our situation even worse. Therefore, the people of our country, students, intellectuals and workers, united in the struggle for peace, opposed this bilateral agreement in public gatherings. We are convinced that even if the Congress eventually approves this agreement, our common struggle will gather strength to prevent the country from becoming even poorer, and to ensure that no Ecuadorian will kill the brothers of any nation in the world. Therefore, our struggle for peace not only regards war as an ugly, inhuman and cruel act—the use of bacteria and napalm is even more ugly and inhuman—but also believes that it puts Ecuador in a state of complete and unstoppable bloody terror. Indeed, only in an atmosphere of peace can we obtain national independence and the reform of our economic system. Without these, there is no freedom and democracy.

In order to prevent or stop the people from opposing the war policy, a systematic propaganda campaign was launched in the cultural sphere. To support this propaganda, they used a large number of publications from UNESCO studying "Man and Food," attempting to rehash those theories that had long been refuted, such as "Malthusian population theory." These publications argue that for overpopulated countries, there is no way out other than war and colonization. They want us to believe that "from a humanitarian point of view, war in China is not only timely but also reasonable," and that "raising infant mortality rates is extremely beneficial to Latin America," as for the United States, "if nothing unexpected happens, they will have another 30 million people to feed in 25 years," they will have no choice but to occupy countries with smaller populations, such as those in Latin America. At the same time, they are trying to convince us that the invading forces in Korea are carrying out a great humanitarian expedition, and the newspapers give us detailed descriptions of those "heroic" acts—especially the bombing of 76 peaceful cities in Korea. This is to prevent people from knowing the truth about the various cruel attacks, and pressure is exerted on the free press or commercial monopolies prevent it from importing paper and machines. In this way, it is impossible to expose the complete lies and the behind-the-scenes truth of the war group. This propaganda is spread to the general population through radio stations and magazine articles published in the United States, and the news used by the radio stations is also from the same news agencies. The film industry, like other commodities, is controlled by international trade monopolies, and strives to create love for the "heroes" in Korea among the masses. For the past few months, they have been poisoning us with heinous and vile propaganda films, which are opposed to the great Chinese people not only politically but also racially.

This kind of national corruption that serves imperialism and war is mainly manifested in education. The "technicians" of the American Educational Services are destroying the most valuable things in the new schools of Ecuador, instilling distorted accounts of national history, and distorting the great struggles of the Ecuadorian people against colonization and for political independence. A clear example of the purpose of this service is to change the names of some universities to the names of American presidents.

The import and wide dissemination of decadent literary works has produced decadent, hypocritical and unhealthy feelings, and justified aggressive ambitions and criminal behavior. This situation is very serious because it has a particularly deep impact on children and young people, who are poisoned daily by obscene articles, detective novels and adventure stories, which make them admire a hero figure, who is none other than a thug in military uniform. Ecuador has made a proposal to the International Child Welfare Congress, and we are making another proposal here, to create a special literature for young people that does not promote violence but is based on peace and friendship, and to immediately launch a strong campaign to oppose those war-mongering toys that encourage children to want to get medals for generals and pilots.

In this case, in the name of so-called "cosmopolitanism," our national traditions and national culture are being destroyed, their essence is lost, their expressions are altered, and their free development is hindered. Just as in the economic field, in the cultural field, a wall is built to prevent people from exchanging knowledge with each other. Because this "cosmopolitanism" is only related to the most decadent products of their so-called Western culture, we cannot know the most beautiful, humane and healthy artistic expressions in the liberated countries.

This multifaceted plan to invade Latin American countries and prepare to drag them into aggressive wars has met with strong resistance in the peaceful feelings of our people. In order to counter the widespread peace movement, a series of political discriminations and offensives have been arranged. Although we are resolutely resisting these, they may eventually make the peace movement illegal. In order to prevent the unified action of the people, and to prevent the pure hands of the people from having to take up the weapons that are often sent to all our countries, imperialism is creating events and friction. For example, those events created on the borders of Ecuador adjacent to Peru and Colombia, and on the borders of Argentina adjacent to Brazil, and on the borders of Bolivia adjacent to Chile. We, the people of Ecuador, believe that all the people of the Americas must be vigilant and not be fooled by these provocations, which are nothing more than an attempt to undermine our brotherly relations and our cause of peace in the Americas and throughout the world.

For these reasons, the struggle for peace is the struggle that is most closely needed by us. We yearn for a peaceful and independent life, a life that we should enjoy, in which the efforts of our people will be for construction rather than to destroy our own future and destroy the future of our brothers. Therefore, our movement to demand an end to the Korean War, to demand the conclusion of a five-power peace treaty, to oppose military agreements, and our opposition to transporting food to aggressive troops and to transporting arms to Latin American countries, is the most glorious and profound expression of Ecuadorian patriotism. We understand that we are far from being a country whose policies are sufficient to determine the fate of the world; but we do not admit what one of our presidents said, that we are the "backyard" or "storeroom" of imperialism; it is for this reason that we come here to declare our agreement with the items on the program; it is for this reason that we want to discuss the solution to the Korean issue, to strengthen the forces against war, that is, to strengthen the forces against Japan's re-militarization; it is for this reason that we want to come and, together with the millions of people who have already taken a step ahead of us, demand the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. It is truly a disgrace to mankind that some so-called scientists, who are not human beings, use these weapons against the peaceful residents of Korea and China; it is for this reason that we demand that the United States ratify the Geneva Protocol; it is also for this reason that we come here to advocate comprehensive cultural and economic exchanges between the people of all countries in the world. We know that in this struggle, in these sufferings, we face the same situation. We also know that the American people are among the first victims of the war policy. We are willing to establish an open and mutually beneficial alliance with the American people to counter the secret and fraudulent alliance between our governments.

Moreover, peace cannot be regional, so there is another task before us. We know that if peace is threatened in the most remote part of the world, then the peace of the whole world is threatened. That is why we have already begun to discuss what solutions we can suggest to the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna. Ecuador will attend that peace congress with the valuable experience of this peace conference, and we will fight at that congress not only to defend our motherland and our lives, but especially for the lives and future of our children and all the children of the world. The children of China have given us warm embraces and smiles with the deepest feelings of friendship that we have ever received. In order to at least partially repay their enthusiasm, we will work together to guarantee them: that they will live their lives in peace, realize their destiny, and will not die prematurely.

    厄瓜多尔代表团团长
    曼·阿·阿吉勒的发言
    只有在这种真正的人民代表聚会一堂的会议上，像厄瓜多尔这样的小国才能自由地发出它们的声音，而不怕官方的造谣与有权势的人的高压。因此，厄瓜多尔祝贺这个三十七个国家十六亿人民的意志所建立起来的伟大的讲坛，这讲坛上的各位代表都显示了他们的决心，一定要为保卫人类与生命而斗争；一定要克服那些力图发动战争不让我们取得协议的人们摆在我们面前的障碍。
    厄瓜多尔代表团不得不克服许多困难，为了到此地来，向全世界揭穿它的统治者的吵嚷，并且告诉朝鲜人民与世界人民：假如我们的政府曾经输送物资去助长侵略，那末我们的人民就派我们来同你们握手告诉你们说，我们的最大愿望就是在和平里共同生活和工作，并和世界一切国家合作。
    我们也祝贺英勇的中国人民与他们的明智的领袖，他们不顾那些存心攻击他们的人的一切恶毒诽谤，毅然表明了争取和平的意愿，召开这个会议，使我们聚集一堂来彼此认识了解，同时证明：在和平的气氛中，世界各国人民是可以共同生活的。对拉丁美洲来讲，尤其是对厄瓜多尔，这次与中国人民及亚洲其他各国人民的直接接触是具有最大的重要性和深刻的意义的。因为实际上我们的结合不仅是由于同处太平洋以及我们有争取和平的共同愿望，而且也因为我们原来有着至亲的关系而且有着同样的问题。这就是说，建造新中国的经验和成就对于我们具有无可估计的重要性。
    对于大多数太平洋沿岸国家，譬如拉丁美洲各国来说，争取和平的斗争是和争取民族独立的斗争密切结合着的。帝国主义集团的战争政策使我们国家的附庸地位一天天在更加降低，而政府最近不经人民的同意，违背人民的利益妄自签订的一些协定和条约，已使我们这些国家处在殖民统治之下。反对这种制度的斗争在拉丁美洲日益蓬勃壮大。这种斗争在太平洋某些地区已经达到了武装行动的阶段，例如越南、马来亚、寮国和高棉。这些国家都受到帝国主义的进攻，帝国主义拚命挣扎，妄想维持它的统治地位，企图打垮这些国家的人民英勇的解放运动，厄瓜多尔向这些国家的人民致敬，因为他们正奋不顾身地来拯救和平与世界各国的独立。
    这种殖民统治的政策以最危险的形式表现在于旧金山签订的所谓“对日和约”和“美日安全条约”上。也表现在接着来的“行政协定”上，这个协定实际上把日本变成了一个殖民地，并且迫使它接受外国占领军的永久驻扎，军事基地的割让，以及供给侵略的炮灰。这种与拉丁美洲国家类似的情形是有特殊重要性的——如果我们还记得帝国主义正想使日本成为进攻亚洲人民的主要基地的话。就为了这个目的，一方面吉田政府和蒋介石幽灵政权签订所谓“中华民国与日本和约”，另一方面帝国主义用尽一切方法使日本重新军国主义化，准备让它进行大规模武装侵略，在国民党卖国贼的帮助下，向真正的中华人民共和国发动进攻。这个中国的和平建设是来自世界各国的代表和列席代表们已经都知道的。就是这一批日本首脑人物曾经说过：“美国希望领导亚洲的是日本”，他们已经表示对这话颇有赞同之意，这表现在他们正企图把太平洋据为私有，这对于亚洲及美洲都是最大的危机。这种企图就不言而喻地要占领属于厄瓜多尔的加拉巴哥斯群岛；因为它在我们共同的大洋上占有战略上的地位。因此，我们认为日本代表团代表着反对重新武装及战争而进行英勇和坚决斗争的日本人民来此出席会议是意味着自由日本的新生而不是它的灭亡，自由日本才是世界和平的最有力的保证。
    但是，这个反对重新军国主义化的斗争是一切国家的人民的任务，因为假若让日本军国主义化自由发展，那么就很难避免战争，并且几乎不可能改善拉丁美洲人民的恶劣的生活条件，因为假若冲突发生了，这些国家的附属性就会更甚于前。
    朝鲜问题是第三次世界大战的可怕的预演，在这中间可以看出将来会用怎样凶恶的武器而且这些武器的出现已经造成怎样巨大的牺牲。帝国主义设法使拉丁美洲派遣士兵前去当侵略朝鲜人民的先锋，去破坏他们自己的生活方式，我们拉丁美洲各国政府在联合国的代表们，违反了我们的意志而提出一些“慷慨”的协助；但是他们没有得到他们所期望的成功。他们派遣前去进行屠杀的只有波多黎各的一营人，它的地位虽然说是一个“自由加入联邦的国家”，实际上只是美国的一个殖民地；派遣前去的还有哥伦比亚的一营兵，这一营兵为了干涉别国，已经付出了生命的代价，而为了对这种干涉作剧烈的抗议，人民于是日益推广和平运动。
    但是还有其他合作的方式。举例来说，厄瓜多尔的政府在发现不能动员我们参加这样一个极不得人心的战争的时候，就运了二百万磅大米接济外国侵略者的军队。这些大米是我们人民的基本粮食，这些大米本来属于厄瓜多尔的人民，是从他们那里偷走的，因为他们生产它，因为他们迫切地需要它，更因为他们并没有到另一个大陆去杀害他们的弟兄。拿朝鲜问题做借口，又拿虚构的从美洲以外来的侵略危险做借口，我国的备战政策正在加强，我们的经济受到了奴役，这一切都严重地损害了人民的利益。厄瓜多尔的人民了解这一点，所以他们宣布反对干涉朝鲜，反对本国政府对这种行为加以援助，政府本没有权利作这种援助，这种援助给劳动人民的贫苦家庭带来最大的痛苦。
    尤其是在侵略朝鲜以后，美国政府和拉丁美洲诸共和国政府之间急忙签订和批准了军事协定以及那些所谓互相援助的双边协定。害怕拉丁诸小国在一次泛美会议上像过去那样联合起来拒绝签订协定，美国就和它们分别地签订了协定。在民意的压力之下，危地马拉和墨西哥的政府猛烈地反对签订这种军事协定。订立这种协定就是最可憎的叛国罪行，并且是对我们国家独立自主的最致命的打击。订立这些协定，使得外国军队占领我们的领土——厄瓜多尔就已经有过这个惨痛的经验。圣达·埃雷那岬和在加拉巴哥斯群岛都作为军事基地而被占领，在战争结束四年以后，经过人民不屈不挠的斗争，才能使这种占领撤销；在占领军撤离以前把所有他们没法带走的机器完全破坏了。不但如此，他们还批准了统一军队的计划，这个计划是在里约热内卢获得赞同，随后在波哥大会议通过的。根据这个计划，厄瓜多尔以及其他拉丁美洲各共和国的武装部队就不属于本国，而是受美国军事使团指挥。不但如此，他们还要强迫我们这一些国家服从于美国的安全法及其修正条款和附加条款，这样就破坏这些共和国宪法里的一些明文规定，根据这些规定，只有由国家的议会里提出及批准的法律才是合法有效的。
    处在帝国主义压力之下的厄瓜多尔经济已经被破坏，使它停留在封建和落后的生产方式上，因此阻止它的农业的机械化和工业发展。这样就使我们国家成为仅是一种原料的来源，仅是一个制成品的市场，这种制成品的价格，由于垄断的结果，完全由统治国任意规定。这结果就自然地使国民收入很低，使收支越来越不平衡，使人民的生活水准，特别是国内劳动人民的生活水准，也同样地降低了。这样，我们的经济就被外国来决定，并且成为美国经济的附庸，美国的经济强迫我们采用为害很大的单种农作物制，并且使我们遭遇危机与失业，这种危机与失业的数字越来越高，这是由于超级资本主义经济周期性危机的结果。
    另一方面，我们国内普通人民的光景越来越坏，因为拉丁美洲的军事费用在不断增加，如我上面所说的，这是与美国军队发生直接经济关系的直接后果。这样，社会事业的经费，例如教育、卫生和公用事业的经费就减少了。
    对外贸易从第二次世界大战以来几乎全部被垄断了，虽然在战前我们和欧洲及亚洲国家，包括中国在内，保持了相当多的贸易关系。这类贸易对于我国的经济，对于和中国友善的人民恢复关系，都是不可缺少的，极端重要的。这个垄断的后果正趋于恶化，因为太平洋公约的签订，给拉丁美洲树立了一个不利于亚洲（包括日本在内）工商业的壁垒。因此，我们宣布反对扼杀别的国家的各种封锁和经济包围，这是符合厄瓜多尔人民的真正利益的。
    这一点又关系到美国对厄瓜多尔贷款的政策。贷款的条件对我们是极其苛重的，简直是出卖我国后代的前途。以虚伪的“援助”为名，其实不是别的，就是奴役，派了一些技术使团到我国来，他们实际上是想要以领薪水的方式，把大部分的贷款消耗掉。同时，他们编制了一个我们的生产潜力的详细清单，目的是以后要利用这些资源来达到战略上的目的。他们贬抑我们本国的真正技术人员的价值，自己却在暗中进行不露痕迹的间谍工作，和早就在厄瓜多尔存在的外国警察机构，狼狈为奸。这个军事公约的目的是逼迫我们不仅要供应人员，而且要交出我们所有的经济资源，同时允许美国把供应“外交使馆的军事人员”的物品免税进口，这个公约将使我们的情况更形恶化。因此，团结在争取和平的斗争中的我国人民，学生、知识分子与工人，都在公共集会上反对这个双边公约。我们深信，即使国会最后竟把这个公约批准，我们的共同斗争会集合力量，使国家不致更加民穷财尽，并且保证不让一个厄瓜多尔人去杀害世界上任何民族的弟兄们。因此，我们争取和平的斗争非但把战争当作一个丑恶的惨无人道的残暴行为——使用细菌与凝固汽油弹更是丑恶与惨无人道——而且认为它使得厄瓜多尔这个国家完全处在无法遏止的血腥恐怖之下。的确，只有在和平的气氛中，我们才能获得民族独立与我们经济制度的改革，没有这些，就谈不到自由与民主。
    为了防范或阻止人民反对战争政策，在文化方面他们发动了一个有系统的宣传运动。为了替这些宣传张目，他们利用一大堆联合国教育、科学及文化组织出版的研究“人与粮食”的刊物，企图重新搬出那些早被否定了的理论，像“马尔萨斯人口论”之类。这些刊物主张，对于人口过剩的国家，除战争与殖民地化外，别无其他出路。他们想让我们相信，“从人道的观点看来，在中国战争不但合时而且合理”，“提高婴儿死亡率对拉丁美洲极其有利”，至于美国，如果没有意外的事情发生，二十五年之后，他们将又有三千万人口须要供养”，他们便无可选择，而只好占领人口较少的国家，如像拉丁美洲那些国家。同时，他们更力图使我们相信，在朝鲜的侵略军正在进行一个伟大的人道的远征，报纸便给我们详细地描写那些“英勇的”行为——尤其是轰炸朝鲜的七十六个和平城市。这样是要使人不知道各种残忍的进攻的真相，对自由的报纸则施以压力或通过商业上的独占阻止它输入纸张与机器。这样，便无从揭露战争集团彻头彻尾的谎言，幕后的真相。这种宣传通过广播电台和美国发行的杂志文章传播到广大的居民中间，广播台所采用的也都是同样通讯社的消息。电影业，也像其他各种商品一样，为国际贸易垄断企业所控制，力图在人民大众中制造对朝鲜“英雄”的爱慕。过去几个月来，他们一直在用罪恶昭彰的下流的宣传影片来毒害我们，这些片子不但在政治上而且在种族上反对伟大的中国人民。
    为帝国主义和战争服务的这种使民族腐化的情况，主要表现在教育方面。美洲教育服务处的“技师们”正在摧毁厄瓜多尔新学校中最宝贵的东西，灌输歪曲本民族历史的说法。并曲解厄瓜多尔人民反对殖民地化和争取政治独立的伟大斗争。说明这种服务的目的一个显明的例子，就是把一些大学的校名改用美国总统的名字。
    由于输入和广泛传播着堕落的文艺作品，使产生了颓废、虚伪而不健康的情感和为侵略野心与犯罪行为辩护。这种情况非常严重，因为它对儿童和青年影响特别深，他们每天受着猥亵文章、侦探小说与冒险故事的毒害，这些使得他们崇拜一种英雄人物，这种英雄人物不是别的，就是穿着军装的暴徒。厄瓜多尔曾向国际保卫儿童大会建议，现在我们在这里再一次建议，为青年创作一种不宣传暴力而建立在和平与友好的基础之上的特殊的文学，并立即展开有力的运动，来反对那些鼓励儿童们想要得到将军和飞行员勋章的好战玩具。
    在这种情况下，在所谓“世界主义”的名义下，我们的民族传统和民族文化正被破坏，它们的精华丧失了，它们的表现方式被窜改了，它们的自由发展受到了阻碍。正像在经济方面的情况一样，在文化方面，筑起了一条不让人民彼此交流知识的围墙。由于这种“世界主义”仅和他们所谓西方的最颓废的文化的产品有关，我们就不可能知道解放了的国家里的最美好的、最人性和最健康的艺术表现。
    向拉丁美洲国家进犯并准备把他们拖进侵略战争的这一多方面的计划在我国人民的和平的感情中碰到了强烈的反抗。为了要和广泛的和平运动作对，已有人安排了一系列的政治上的歧视和攻势。对这些虽然我们正在坚决地予以反抗，但可能终于使和平运动成为非法。为了阻止人民的统一的行动，和使纯洁的人民的手从此不得不拿起那些经常被送到我们所有国家里来的武器，帝国主义正在制造事件和摩擦。譬如在厄瓜多尔毗连秘鲁与哥伦比亚的边境上以及在阿根廷毗连巴西的边境上、玻利维亚毗连智利的边境上所制造的那些事件。我们厄瓜多尔人民相信：全美洲人民必须保持警惕，不要上这些挑拨的当，这些挑拨无非是要破坏我们兄弟般的关系和我们在美洲以及全世界的和平事业。
    由于这些原因，争取和平的斗争对我们是最切身需要的斗争。我们渴望着我们能享受和平和独立的生活，这是我们应该享受的生活，在这种生活里面，我们人民的努力将是为了建设而不是去毁坏我们自己的前途，破坏我们兄弟们的前途。因之，我们要求结束朝鲜战争、要求缔结五大国和平公约、反对军事公约的运动，和我们反对给侵略军队输送粮食、反对给拉丁美洲诸国运送军火，乃是厄瓜多尔爱国主义最光荣、最深刻的表现。我们明白我们远不是一个其政策足以决定世界命运的国家；可是我们不承认我们的一位总统所说的，我们是帝国主义的“后院”或“贮藏室”；就是因为这个原故，我们到这里来声明我们同意纲领上的各项；就是因为这个原故，我们要来讨论朝鲜问题的解决办法，来加强反对战争的力量，也就是加强反对日本重新军国主义化的力量；就是因为这个原故，我们要来，和千千万万已经比我们先走一步的人，一起要求禁止细菌武器。说起来真是人类的耻辱，竟有一些自称为科学家的不是人的东西使用这种武器对付朝鲜和中国的和平居民；就是这个原故，我们要求美国批准日内瓦议定书；也就是这个原故，我们到这里来主张世界各国人民之间作全面的文化和经济交流。我们知道在这斗争中，在这些苦难中，我们的遭遇是一样的。我们也都知道，战争政策的第一批牺牲者中，美国人民也在内。我们愿意和美国人民建立开诚布公而互利的联盟，以对抗我们政府之间秘密的欺诈的联盟。
    而且，和平不能是区域性的，所以在我们面前又有另外一个任务。我们知道，假如和平在世界最边远的一个地方受到了威胁，那么，全世界的和平也就受到了威胁。这就是为什么我们已经开始讨论着我们能够向将在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会建议那些解决方法。厄瓜多尔将带着这次和平会议的宝贵经验去出席那个和平大会，我们将在那个会上不仅为保卫祖国和我们的生活而斗争，并特别为我们的子女和世界上一切儿童的生活和前途而斗争。中国的儿童们以我们曾经领受过的最深挚的友爱的情感给予我们热情的拥抱和微笑。为了至少给他们的热情得到部分报答，我们将共同合作来给他们保证：他们将平安地度过一生，实现他们的命运，而不会中途夭折。　（新华社）
