    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] To celebrate the signing of the China-Ceylon trade agreement, the Chinese delegation attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference hosted a banquet on the evening of the 8th to entertain the Ceylon delegation. Invited to the banquet were the head of the Ceylon delegation, Narawila Damararatana, and all the delegates. Attending the banquet from the Chinese delegation were Deputy Head Guo Moruo and his wife, delegates Chen Shutong, Ma Yinchu, Xiraojiacuo, Ji Chaoding, Yuanying, and non-voting delegate Zhao Puchu.
    The banquet was presided over by Deputy Head Guo Moruo. At the beginning of the banquet, Guo Moruo delivered a speech, warmly congratulating the signing of the Sino-Sri Lankan trade agreement. He said: At the peace conference, we advocated opposing blockades and embargoes and restoring international economic exchanges; now, we have realized this in action. The Sino-Sri Lankan trade agreement not only meets the material needs of the two countries, but also will enhance the friendship between the two peoples. Narawila Damararatana, the head of the Sri Lankan delegation, then delivered a speech, saying: For the past three years, one of the goals of the Sri Lankan peace movement has been to oppose embargo policies and demand trade with New China, and we are very happy to see that this goal has been achieved. The Sino-Sri Lankan trade agreement has built a bridge between the peoples of the two countries, and I believe that the peoples of the two countries will definitely work together for peace.
    The banquet was filled with an atmosphere of unity and friendship from beginning to end. The hosts and guests frequently raised their glasses to peace, to further enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Sri Lankan people, and to the development of trade between China and Sri Lanka.
