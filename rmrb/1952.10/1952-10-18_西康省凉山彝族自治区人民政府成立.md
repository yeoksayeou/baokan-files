    The First People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region of Xikang Province was held on National Day and successfully concluded after seven days. The conference formally announced the establishment of the People's Government of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region. The conference was attended by 328 representatives of the Yi, Han, and Miao ethnic groups from the seven counties under the region's jurisdiction. Yang Xin, a representative of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, and Liang Wenying, a representative of the People's Government of Xikang Province, attended the inaugural meeting of the Autonomous Region's People's Government.

    Wazhamuji (Yi ethnicity), Deputy Commissioner of the Xichang Special District of Xikang Province and Director of the Preparatory Committee of the People's Government of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region, delivered a work report on the Liangshan area over the past two years. He said: The serious disunity among ethnic groups and within the Yi ethnicity in the Liangshan area before liberation has been rapidly eliminated in the past two years, and the backwardness and poverty are being changed, which has laid a good foundation for further construction of Liangshan. Therefore, the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government is urgently needed by the Yi people. He pointed out: The facts of the past two years have proved that only under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, and with the close unity of all ethnic groups and within our Yi ethnicity, can we have such a bright future.

    During the conference, all the representatives enthusiastically discussed the issue of implementing ethnic regional autonomy. After consultation, they elected Wazhamuji (Yi) as Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, Zhang Rong (Han), Wang Cenming (Yi), and Zhou Quanzhi (Han) as Vice Chairmen, and Bage Wahar and 36 others as government members. The conference also established the Consultative Committee of the First People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region, electing Wazhamuji (Yi) as Chairman of the Consultative Committee, Zhang Min (Han), Ahou Nihargen (Yi) and five others as Vice Chairmen, and Bage Wahar and 69 others as members. The conference also adopted the Organizational Regulations of the Autonomous Region People's Government and the future work tasks of the Autonomous Region People's Government, deciding that the central task for the entire region in the future will be to continue strengthening ethnic unity, completing the construction of the government in each county of the Autonomous Region, and vigorously launching the patriotic production movement.

    At the meeting, Yang Xin, a representative of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, and Liang Wenying, a representative of the People's Government of Xikang Province, delivered speeches one after another. They unanimously pointed out that the establishment of the People's Government of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region is a great and joyous event. It is hoped that the 700,000 Yi people and other ethnic groups in the entire Autonomous Region will give full play to the spirit of being masters of their own affairs in the future, and under the leadership of the Autonomous Region People's Government, strive to implement the ethnic regional autonomy policy of the Central People's Government, and strive for the assistance of the Han people. All Han and Yi cadres in the Autonomous Region should unite and cooperate and learn from each other. During the conference, the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, and the People's Governments of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Xikang provinces and their respective special districts and counties all sent congratulatory telegrams. The Yi people from the Xichang Special District of Xikang and the Zhaotong Special District of Yunnan also sent representatives to congratulate them in person.

    On October 8, Zhaojue City, the capital of the Autonomous Region, was decorated with lanterns and streamers, and the atmosphere was festive. Yi people from all over the region climbed mountains and crossed rivers to participate in the celebration of the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government.
