Xinhua News Agency: W.E.B. Du Bois, the famous American peace fighter, wrote a letter congratulating the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The full text is as follows:
    To the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference:

    I would like to extend the warmest congratulations on behalf of the fifteen million Black people of the United States to the people of Asia who are committed to building world peace.

    I only visited Asia once, in 1936, when I visited China and Japan; I recognized that the people of Asia, in terms of population size, work ethic, and long cultural tradition, are in a leading position for the people of the whole world. This leadership must be emphasized and expressed. The days when the people of Asia sought leadership from Europe or the United States, or relied on their aid or mercy, are gone forever.

    In our America, cultural regression has been increasing in recent years, and most people, against their wisdom and conscience, allow their country to move towards war and preparations for war, neglecting education and undermining their democratic ideals.

    My own nation is the humblest nation in our country; for three hundred years, Black workers have accumulated wealth that has made our country famous in the world, but they are still regarded as inferior citizens, and are mostly deprived of the right to vote, equal opportunities for work and wages, and the citizenship rights of American citizens. They especially extend their hands to Asia, hailing the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the independence of India and Pakistan, and the struggle for new freedom and democracy being waged by Burma and Vietnam.

    I am convinced that your conference will strengthen Asia's efforts to break away from Europe and become independent, as well as the enthusiasm for brotherly friendship and cooperation in the struggle for a world without war, to abolish poverty and ignorance, and to promote health and moral spirit.

Xinhua News Agency: Jorge Amado, the world-famous Brazilian peace fighter, winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize "For Strengthening International Peace," and writer, wrote a letter congratulating the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The full text is as follows:

    I would like to congratulate the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and I am convinced that the conference will represent the people of this region and once again demonstrate the firm will to defeat the petty men who are preparing for war. The warmongers are trying to turn the Korean War into a springboard for launching another war that will affect not only the people of the Pacific region but also the people of the whole world.

    The Brazilian people, in a nationwide and vigorous movement, have found a way to stop the dispatch of Brazilian troops to Korea. The Brazilian women said: "We will never let our children be sent to Korea." The Brazilian workers, together with all our people, are conducting a nationwide fundraising campaign to purchase an ambulance and medicines to donate to the Korean people who are suffering under the shameful aggression of American imperialism. In this war, the Brazilian people are not neutral. They feel that they are completely united with the Korean people. Their enemies - the North American warmongers - are also the enemies of Korea and all the people of the Pacific region. The peace-loving people of Brazil know that the existence of the Soviet Union and People's China is a powerful guarantee of world peace, and they are closely concerned about this peace conference of the people of the Pacific region.

    美国杜波依斯和巴西乔治·亚马多
    分别写信祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    【新华社讯】著名美国和平战士杜波依斯教授曾经写信祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，全文如下：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议：
    我愿代表美国一千五百万黑人向致力于建立世界和平的亚洲人民致以最热烈的祝贺。
    我只在一九三六年到过一次亚洲，访问了中国和日本；认识到亚洲人民在人口数量、工作勤劳和悠久的文化传统方面，对全世界的人民说来，都居于领导的地位。这种领导必须加以强调并且表达出来。亚洲人民寻求欧洲或美国的领导或者依靠他们的援助或慈悲的日子已经一去不返了。
    在我们美国，近几年来，文化日益倒退，大多数人民违反了他们的智慧与良知，容许他们的国家奔向战争和备战，漠视教育，破坏他们的民主理想。
    我自己这个民族是我们国家里的最低微的民族；三百年来，黑人工人累积了财富使我们的国家得以闻名于世，但是仍被视为下等国民，大都被剥夺了投票权、工作和工资的平等机会以及美国国民的公民权。他们特别向亚洲伸出他们的手，欢呼中华人民共和国的建立、印度和巴基斯坦的独立，以及缅甸和越南所进行的争取新的自由和民主的斗争。
    我深信：你们这个会议必将加强亚洲脱离欧洲而独立的努力，以及争取一个没有战争的世界的兄弟友好与合作的热情，为废除贫困与愚昧、增进健康和道德精神而奋斗。
    【新华社讯】世界著名的巴西和平战士，“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人、作家乔治·亚马多曾经写信祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。全文如下：
    我谨向亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议祝贺，并深信会议将代表这个区域的人民再次表明要击败正在准备战争的小人物的坚强意志。战争贩子们企图把朝鲜战争变成掀起另一次不仅是影响太平洋区域人民并且影响全世界人民的战争的跳板。
    巴西人民在一次全国性的轰轰烈烈的运动中，已找到制止派遣巴西军队到朝鲜去的方法。巴西的妇女们说：“我们决不让我们的孩子遣送到朝鲜去。”巴西的工人和我们的全体人民一道，正在进行一个全国性的募捐来购置一辆救护车和药品，赠给在美帝国主义可耻的侵略下遭难的朝鲜人民。在这次战争中巴西人民并不是中立的。他们觉得他们和朝鲜人民是完全团结在一起的。他们的敌人--北美洲的战争贩子们--也就是朝鲜和所有太平洋区域人民的敌人。巴西爱好和平的人民知道，苏联和人民中国的存在就是世界和平的有力保障，对于这次太平洋区域人民的和平会议，他们是密切关心注视着的。
