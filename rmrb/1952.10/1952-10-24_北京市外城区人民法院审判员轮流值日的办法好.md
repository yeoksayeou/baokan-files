    The Practice of Rotation for Judges on Duty at the Outer District People's Court of Beijing is Good
    To the Editor: Since June of this year, the Outer District People's Court of Beijing has set up a "Consultation Office" – meaning that the Civil Division sends a judge to rotate daily, responsible for handling "consultations," "case acceptance," "legal drafting," and "case expediting" work. When the duty officer meets with parties, they prioritize handling case submissions and expediting, and then answer questions, draft pleadings, and resolve simpler disputes. If it cannot be handled immediately, the duty officer writes their opinion in the conversation record book and submits it to the responsible cadre for review and processing. The method for answering questions or resolving disputes is to handle similar cases collectively, to save manpower and time. Even if the issues are not of the same nature, other people waiting to have their issues resolved can listen in when resolving a certain party's issue. There are several advantages to doing this: (1) If the issue being resolved is similar to the listener's issue, the listener may resolve it themselves after hearing it. (2) When resolving an issue, the relevant policies and laws are explained first. This raises the policy understanding of the masses. (3) Listeners see that the cadres are indeed busy resolving issues, and they can wait patiently. (4) If a party is being unreasonable, the listeners can also speak up and criticize them. If a party is still unclear about the answered question, the listeners can also explain it to them. In short, from past experience, this method is very good. Not only are issues resolved promptly and convenient for the masses, but the policy understanding of the cadres is also improved.

### 北京市外城区人民法院审判员轮流值日的办法好

    北京市外城区人民法院审判员轮流值日的办法好
    编辑同志：北京市外城区人民法院自今年六月以来，设置了“问事处”——即民庭每天派一审判员轮流值日，负责处理“问事”、“收案”、“代书”、“催案”等工作。值班人接见当事人时，优先处理递状、催案的，然后答复问题、代写诉状、解决一些较简单的纠纷。不能即刻处理的，由值班人在谈话记录簿上写下意见，送交负责干部研究处理。解答问题或解决纠纷的办法，是把同类性质的作集体处理，以节省人力和时间。即使不是同类性质的问题，在解决某当事人的问题时，其他等待解决问题的人也可以旁听。这样做有几个好处：（一）正在解决的问题如果和旁听人的问题相似，旁听人听后，可能就自行解决了。（二）解决某一问题时，先说明有关的政策法令。这就提高了群众的政策水平。（三）旁听人看到干部的确在忙于解决问题，可以耐心等待。（四）如果当事人有不讲理的，旁听人也可发言批评他。如果当事人对所答复的问题还搞不清楚，旁听的人也可以给他解说。总之，从过去的情况来看，这个办法很好，不但解决问题及时，群众方便，干部的政策水平也提高了。
