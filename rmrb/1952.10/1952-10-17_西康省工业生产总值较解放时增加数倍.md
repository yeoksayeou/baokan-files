Since liberation, industry in Xikang Province has seen initial development. Before liberation, under the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, industrial production in Xikang Province was paralyzed. After liberation, the People's Government took over eight factories, of which only four were in operation, employing less than one hundred workers in total. These factories generally had rudimentary and dilapidated machinery, poor management, large organizations, excessive staff, and unsound systems.

In the two years since liberation, the People's Government has adopted the policy of "using factories to support factories, striving for self-sufficiency, and gradually expanding" to reorganize the factories that were in operation. It also focused on restoring factories that had been shut down. At the same time, based on the central government's policy of prioritizing restoration and development, and considering the actual conditions of the province, it newly built asbestos, mica, and other mines, and expanded the power generation capacity of the original power plants. Currently, the number of factories and mines in Xikang Province has increased, and several others are under construction. These factories and mines are larger in scale than the old ones, and the number of employees has greatly increased compared to the early days of liberation. In 1951, the total industrial output value of Xikang Province was five times that of 1950. The initial development of industrial production in Xikang Province has not only preliminarily developed the rich mineral resources of Xikang Province, solved some of the difficulties in people's lives, and promoted the prosperity of industry and commerce, but also strengthened the unity between ethnic groups. The Brazilian minority ethnic group and the local mica mine workers are as close as a family. In the past, they believed that "mining is not possible here" and "women cannot go up the mountain," but these backward ideas have been shattered in the development of production.

In the restoration and development of various factories and mines, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have launched a series of political movements and various reforms, gradually implementing the policy of "enterprise management and democratic management." The class consciousness of the workers has greatly improved compared to the early days of liberation, establishing a new labor attitude as masters of their own affairs, and demonstrating a high degree of initiative and creativity in production. The unity among workers has also been strengthened. The wages of the vast majority of workers have gradually increased with the development of production, and labor insurance and other welfare benefits have been gradually implemented. Various preliminary reforms have been carried out in various factories and mines, streamlining organizations and redundant personnel, reducing expenditures, and initially reducing costs. At the same time, various unreasonable systems have been abolished, labor discipline has been rectified, and systems for work point recording, budget estimates and final accounts, and machine safety have been established.

Currently, there are still some problems in factory and mine production. First of all, there is still a lack of experience in production management, resulting in varying degrees of chaos in management work. Planning work is not accurate enough, product costs are still high, and accidents causing injuries and deaths and mechanical accidents are still relatively serious. Secondly, political education for workers in general is not done well enough, so that some ideological problems among workers, especially among staff, have not been well resolved.

    西康省工业生产总值较解放时增加数倍
    解放以来，西康省的工业已经有了初步的发展。解放前，在国民党反动政府的长期统治下，西康省的工业生产陷于瘫痪状态。解放后，人民政府接管的工厂有八个，其中开工生产的仅只四个，全部职工不到一百人。这些工厂一般机器设备简陋残旧，经营管理不善，机构庞大，冗员极多，各种制度都不健全。
    解放后两年多以来，人民政府对于已开工的工厂采取了“以厂养厂，争取自给，逐步扩大”的方针进行整顿；对于停工的工厂进行了重点恢复；同时根据中央重点恢复发展的方针，结合本省实际情况，新建了石棉、云母等厂矿，并扩大了原有电厂的发电能力。目前，西康省厂矿已有增加，还有几个正在筹建，这些厂矿的规模都比旧有的大，职工人数比解放初期大大增加。一九五一年西康省工业生产总值相当于一九五○年工业生产总值的五倍。西康省的工业生产得到初步发展后，不但初步开发了西康省的丰富的矿藏，解决了人民生活中的一些困难，繁荣了工商业，并且加强了民族之间的团结。巴西的少数民族和当地云母矿的职工亲如一家人。过去，他们认为“这里不能挖矿”，“女人不能上山”，在生产的发展中，这些落后思想都被打破了。
    在各厂矿的恢复与发展中，中国共产党和人民政府曾经发动群众进行了一系列的政治运动和各种改革，逐步地贯彻了“经营企业化，管理民主化”的方针。职工的阶级觉悟，较之初解放时已有很大提高，树立了主人翁的新的劳动态度，在生产中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。职工间的团结也加强了。绝大多数职工的工资都随着生产的发展而逐步提高，劳动保险和其他福利都已逐步实施。在各厂矿中都已进行了各种初步的改革，精简了机构和冗员，缩小了开支，初步降低了成本。同时，取消了各种不合理的制度，整顿了劳动纪律，建立记工、预决算、机器安全等制度。
    目前，在厂矿生产中也还存在着一些问题。首先，在生产管理上还缺少经验，因而在管理工作中尚有程度不同的混乱现象，计划工作不够准确，产品成本还很高，伤亡事故和机械事故还较严重。其次，对于职工的政治教育一般都做得不够，以致职工中特别是职员中的一些思想问题尚未很好解决。
