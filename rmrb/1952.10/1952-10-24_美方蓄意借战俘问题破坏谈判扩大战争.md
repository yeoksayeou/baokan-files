(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 23rd) From Harrison to Clark to the United States Information Service, they have long been singing the same old tune, insisting that a large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war "refuse repatriation," and therefore, the U.S. "must use force" to repatriate all prisoners of war. They cannot do so for the sake of so-called "humanitarianism." They are obviously trying to shirk the responsibility of the U.S. for sabotaging the armistice negotiations, deceive world opinion, and deceive other countries in the United Nations, so that they will agree to the U.S.'s unreasonable demand to forcibly detain prisoners of war in order to expand the war of aggression.

But the opposite is true. Even if the U.S. uses all kinds of inhuman and bloody means to forcibly detain prisoners of war, all Korean and Chinese prisoners of war would rather die than resolutely demand repatriation. The facts are there, and no amount of lies can cover them up.

From the very beginning of the discussion of the prisoner of war issue in December 1951, the U.S. had already decided to detain a large number of prisoners of war. They initially played tricks on the prisoner of war list, attempting to secretly withhold prisoners of war. The prisoner of war list they handed over to us on December 18 last year was missing more than 44,000 people compared to the prisoner of war list they transferred to us through the International Committee of the Red Cross. After this conspiracy was exposed, the U.S. described 37,000 of them as "South Korean civilians"; at first they said they had been released, but later they said they were still in U.S. prisoner of war camps. Then the U.S. proposed absurd demands such as "one-for-one exchange" and "voluntary repatriation"; the U.S. also openly promoted the transfer of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs, and in fact had already handed over our captured personnel to Syngman Rhee under the pretext of fake release. This fully exposed the U.S.'s sinister conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

In order to create so-called "South Korean civilians" and so-called "refusal to repatriate," the U.S. carried out unprecedented bloody massacres and barbaric persecutions in its prisoner of war camps, and euphemistically called this atrocity "screening." However, even the International Committee of the Red Cross, which served U.S. interests, had to reveal the truth about this so-called "screening" by the U.S., forced by the facts. In its report on the massacre of prisoners of war on Geoje Island on February 18, the International Committee of the Red Cross admitted that all the prisoners of war in Prisoner of War Camp No. 62 on Geoje Island were captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, but "because the South Korean government authorities believed they were South Koreans," "they were listed as 'detained civilians.'" However, on February 8, all the prisoners of war in this camp expressed their firm will to demand repatriation to their motherland through action. They held a meeting to commemorate the founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army, "with nearly 6,000 people participating, with extreme excitement and enthusiasm." In order to use force to compel the prisoners of war who firmly demanded repatriation to act as "civilians" who "refused repatriation," the U.S. "carried out its designed re-screening with the support of the army." As a result of this "screening" with bayonets, at least 56 prisoners of war were killed on the spot, and 317 prisoners of war were wounded.

In all U.S. prisoner of war camps, the U.S. used a large number of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gang agents to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. This has been confirmed by many American newspapers and American news agencies, and by our captured personnel who were forced to act as agents by the U.S. and parachuted into our area. Colson, the head of the U.S. prisoner of war camp, admitted in his letter to our captured personnel that the U.S. forcibly "screened" Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and admitted that massacres were carried out on prisoners of war, resulting in deaths and injuries. Although the U.S. government quibbled about the crimes admitted by Colson, Colson always claimed that he admitted all these true things under the instruction of his superiors "not to admit anything untrue."

While the U.S. unscrupulously forced prisoners of war to "refuse repatriation" with bayonets in its prisoner of war camps, it insisted at the meeting that the Korean and Chinese sides accept this principle of so-called "no forced repatriation" of prisoners of war. Based on specific facts and international law, our side resolutely opposed this illegal "screening" by the U.S. and insisted on resolving the issue in accordance with the principle of repatriation of prisoners stipulated in the Geneva Convention. On this point, even the accomplice countries in the invasion of Korea once had to agree. The "Washington Daily News" on April 10 said that Britain, France, and Canada demanded that "the United States agree to the Communist's demand for the repatriation of all prisoners of war raised in the Korean armistice talks," because "refusing to repatriate 'all' prisoners of war may violate the Geneva Convention." But the U.S. government still insisted on its own way and insisted on the unreasonable demand to detain prisoners of war. In order to promote the armistice negotiations, our side repeatedly made major efforts, and on March 21, proposed a principled proposal for complete repatriation based on the prisoner of war list exchanged on December 18 last year, and on March 27, proposed a proposal on the principle of adjusting the repatriation of prisoners. Our side also issued a statement on the issue of repatriation of prisoners on April 6 to dispel any excuse for the U.S. to detain prisoners of war. In the statement, our side stated that we are well aware that our captured personnel were forced to tattoo and write blood letters in U.S. prisoner of war camps, "which was by no means of their own volition and should not be held responsible by them. We completely welcome all our captured personnel back to the embrace of the motherland." Harrison and the United States Information Service now fabricate out of thin air that our side "agreed to let the Communist prisoners of war in the Allied prisoner of war camps be screened" in this statement, which is really shameless to the extreme.

The U.S. flagrantly disregarded the major concessions made by our side, and overturned their promise made on April 1 to prepare to repatriate 116,000 of our prisoners of war, and on April 19, proposed the absurd figure of repatriating 70,000 of our prisoners of war. On the contrary, our side's attitude was that our side proposed the figure of 12,000 prisoners of war on the same day, including the newly captured U.S. prisoners of war, which fully proves our side's sincerity in the armistice negotiations.

After proposing the figure of 70,000 prisoners of war for repatriation, the U.S. insisted that this was a "firm, final, and unchangeable" plan, forcing our side to accept it. Hickman, the U.S. spokesman, also said pretentiously that this was the result of their "individual investigation" of all prisoners of war, and that the U.S. had given them a "full explanation so that the investigation could be conducted absolutely fairly." But this trick was quickly exposed. The heroic struggles of our captured personnel in U.S. prisoner of war camps such as Geoje Island and Busan and Yeongcheon exposed the bloody truth of the so-called "screening" by the U.S., and proved that the U.S.'s figures for repatriation of prisoners were completely fabricated. This made the American aggressors make a big fool of themselves in front of the whole world. The U.S. "Time" magazine on June 2 revealed the manufacturing process of the 70,000 repatriation figure. It said: After Washington decided on the absurd principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation," "it issued an order for screening." This order was passed from Ridgway to the Eighth Army, and finally to the person in charge of "screening." They "did their best." But no matter how hard the U.S. tried, the will of our captured personnel to demand repatriation to their motherland was still unyielding. "Time" magazine admitted that the U.S. beat to death on the spot those prisoners of war who expressed their willingness to repatriate in order to suppress the just struggle of our captured personnel, but still failed to achieve their despicable purpose. Therefore, the Eighth Army had to "hide the specific practices of counting, and finally gave a vague figure, saying that there were 59,000 North Korean and Chinese prisoners who would not 'refuse repatriation by violence.' Later, after searching among the half-hearted South Koreans, the number of people going to the north was increased to 70,000." The ugly situation of the so-called "screening" created by the U.S. in order to detain prisoners of war has never been so clearly exposed.

After this plan was refuted by our side and was completely indefensible, the U.S. adopted the method of continuous absenteeism, while frantically massacring prisoners of war in its prisoner of war camps, and unilaterally transferred 38,000 prisoners of war to the Syngman Rhee gang one after another, regardless of our side's warnings. All of this can only be explained by the U.S.'s deliberate use of the prisoner of war issue to delay and even sabotage the armistice negotiations, and there can be no other explanation.

This shameless means of the U.S. to obstruct the armistice negotiations has been opposed by the people of the world. In order to deceive world opinion, the U.S. claimed on July 1 that it was willing to "sincerely seek an armistice," but at the administrative meeting, the U.S. overturned the principle of complete repatriation of prisoners of war stipulated in Articles 51 and 52 of the agreed-upon draft armistice agreement, and proposed a figure of 83,000 prisoners of war for repatriation, attempting to detain 20% of the Korean People's Army prisoners of war and 68% of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war. The U.S. also once again described this plan as "firm, final, and unchangeable," and completely refused to conduct any discussion. From June 7 to October 8, the U.S. used the method of adjourning for three days, seven days, and ten days in a row, causing the meeting to be suspended for more than 70 days.

On September 28, the U.S. cancelled their second "unchangeable" plan and proposed so-called three suggestions. According to these three "suggestions," prisoners of war are still illegally divided into two categories: those who are willing to be repatriated and those who "refuse to be repatriated," and countless facts have fully proved that "refusal to be repatriated" is just a euphemism for the U.S. to forcibly detain prisoners of war. Therefore, the so-called new "suggestions" of the U.S. are actually the same old tricks with a different soup, which are absolutely unacceptable. However, in order to satisfy the world's people's desire for an armistice in Korea, our side put forward a completely fair and reasonable new proposal at the meeting on October 8, which accepted the formal changes in the U.S. proposal. However, Harrison, the chief representative of the U.S. negotiations, ignored our side's new proposal and took out a long statement prepared long ago to suspend the armistice negotiations and read it out, and left the meeting without waiting for our side to speak. In order to open the negotiation door that was forcibly closed by the U.S., Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai of our side sent a letter to Clark, the commander-in-chief of the U.S., on October 16, requesting the resumption of armistice negotiations, but were also flatly rejected by Clark. So far, the U.S.'s conspiracy to use the prisoner of war issue to delay and even finally sabotage the armistice negotiations has been completely exposed.

The entire discussion process of the prisoner of war issue in the armistice negotiations proves that in order to sabotage the armistice negotiations, the U.S. did not hesitate to adopt shameless rogue means such as reneging on its promises, spreading rumors and lies, threatening and destroying, and using "military pressure" inside and outside the meeting, and did not hesitate to pave the way for their sabotage of the negotiations with the lives and blood of prisoners of war. Where are their "moral principles"? Where are their "humanitarian principles"? They have completely torn up the Geneva Convention that they themselves signed. Contrary to the attitude of the U.S., the Korean and Chinese sides have unswervingly abided by the Geneva Convention throughout the entire negotiation process, and have done everything possible to make the greatest efforts to seek compromise under the principle of repatriation of prisoners stipulated in the Convention. The U.S. is now openly hostile to the people of the world and has brazenly closed the door to armistice negotiations. The people of the world must be seriously vigilant about the conspiracy of the American aggressors to expand the war, and rise up to fight for the realization of an armistice in Korea in accordance with the principle of repatriation of prisoners stipulated in the Geneva Convention.

    美方蓄意借战俘问题破坏谈判扩大战争
    【新华社开城二十三日电】从哈利逊，克拉克到美国新闻处，很久就在唱着一支同样的滥调，硬说有大批朝中战俘“拒绝遣返”，因此，美方“必须使用武力”才能遣返全部战俘。为了所谓“人道主义”的原故，他们不能这样做。他们显然企图借此推卸美方破坏停战谈判的责任，欺骗世界舆论，欺骗联合国中其他国家，使他们同意美方强迫扣留战俘的无理主张，以便扩大侵略战争。
    但是事实恰恰相反，纵然美方用尽一切惨无人道的血腥手段来强迫扣留战俘，全体朝中战俘仍然宁死也坚决要求遣返。事实俱在，决不是一纸谎言所能掩盖得了的。
    美方从一九五一年十二月战俘问题的讨论一开始，就打定主意要扣留大批战俘。他们最初在战俘名单上玩花样，企图偷偷扣下战俘。他们在去年十二月十八日交给我方的战俘名单，较之他们经由红十字国际委员会转交我方的战俘名单，竟缺少了四万四千多人。在这个阴谋被揭穿以后，美方就把其中三万七千人说成是“南朝鲜平民”；起初说他们已被释放，后来又说他们还在美方战俘营中。接着美方又提出“一对一交换”、“自愿遣返”等等荒谬主张；美方并且公开宣传要将朝中战俘移交给蒋介石、李承晚匪帮，而且事实上已经将我方被俘人员假释放之名交给李承晚。这就充分暴露了美方强迫扣留战俘的罪恶阴谋。
    为了制造所谓“南朝鲜平民”和所谓“拒绝遣返”，美方在其战俘营中进行了史无前例的血腥屠杀和野蛮迫害，而把这种暴行美其名曰“甄别”。但是就是为美国利益服务的红十字国际委员会，迫于事实，也不得不透露了美方这种所谓“甄别”的真相。红十字国际委员会在其关于二月十八日巨济岛上屠杀战俘事件的报告中承认：在巨济岛六十二号战俘营中的全是朝鲜人民军的被俘人员，只是“由于南朝鲜政府当局认为他们是南朝鲜人”，
    “他们被列为‘被扣平民’”。可是二月八日，这个战俘营的全部战俘用行动表示了他们要求遣返祖国的坚决意志。他们举行了一个纪念朝鲜人民军建军节的大会，“参加大会的差不多有六千人，激昂慷慨，达于极点”。美方为了用武力强迫坚决要求遣返的战俘充当“拒绝遣返”的“平民”，就“以军队为支援，进行其所设计的重新甄别”。这次用刺刀进行“甄别”的结果，至少有五十六名战俘当场被杀死，被打伤的战俘达三百一十七人。
    在所有美方战俘营中，美方利用大批蒋介石、李承晚匪帮的特务，强迫扣留朝中战俘。这已为许多美国报纸和美国通讯社的消息所证实，并且为美方强迫充当特务并空降到我方地区的我方被俘人员所证实。美方战俘营负责人柯尔生在其给我方被俘人员的信中，承认美方对朝中战俘实行强迫“甄别”，并承认对战俘进行屠杀以致死伤多人。尽管美国政府狡赖柯尔生所供认的罪状，柯尔生却始终声称他是在他的上级的“不要承认任何不真实的事情”的指示下，承认了这一切真实的事情。
    美方一方面肆无忌惮地在其战俘营中用刺刀强迫战俘“拒绝遣返”，一方面却在会议上硬要朝中方面接受这种所谓“不得强迫遣返”战俘的原则。我方根据具体事实和国际公法，坚决反对美方这种非法的“甄别”，并坚持按照日内瓦公约规定的遣俘原则解决问题。关于这一点，就是侵朝帮凶国家也曾经不能不同意。四月十日的“华盛顿每日新闻”说，英、法、加拿大要求“美国同意共产党在朝鲜停战会谈中所提遣返全部战俘的要求”，因为“拒绝遣返‘全部’战俘可能破坏日内瓦公约”。但是美国政府仍然一意孤行，坚持扣留战俘的无理主张。为了促进停战谈判，我方一再作了重大努力，在三月二十一日提出根据去年十二月十八日交换的战俘名单进行全部遣返的原则建议，并在三月二十七日提出关于遣俘调整原则的建议。我方并在四月六日对遣俘问题发表声明，以解除美方的任何扣留战俘的藉口。我方在声明中声称，我方深知我方被俘人员在美方战俘营中被迫刺字和写血书，“绝非出于他们自愿，不应由他们负责。我们完全欢迎我方全体被俘人员回到祖国的怀抱”。哈利逊和美国新闻处现在竟然凭空捏造说我方在这个声明中“同意让在联军战俘营中的共产党战俘受甄别”，这真是无耻到了极点。
    美方悍然不顾我方所作的重大让步，并且推翻了他们在四月一日所作的准备遣返我方十一万六千名战俘的诺言，竟在四月十九日提出遣返我方七万战俘的荒唐数字。而我方的态度恰恰相反，我方在同一天提出的遣俘数字是一万二千人，把新俘获的美方战俘也加了进去，这就充分证明我方对于停战谈判的诚意。
    美方在提出七万人的遣俘数字以后，坚持这是“坚定的、最后的、不可改变的”方案，强迫我方接受。美方发言人希克曼还若有其事地说这是他们对全体战俘进行了“个别调查”的结果，还说美方向他们作了“充分的解释，以便调查能进行得绝对公平”。可是这个西洋镜很快就被拆穿了。巨济岛和釜山、永川等美方战俘营中我方被俘人员的英勇斗争，揭露了美方所谓“甄别”的血腥真相，并且证明美方的遣俘数字完全是捏造出来的。这就使美国侵略者在全世界面前大出其丑。六月二日的美国“时代”周刊透露了七万遣俘数字的制造经过。它说：华盛顿在决定了所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则以后，“就下了关于进行甄别的命令”。这道命令从李奇微传到第八军，最后传达到负责“甄别”的人。他们就“尽心力而为之”。可是无论美方如何用尽心力，我方被俘人员要求遣返祖国的意志仍然不可屈服。“时代”周刊承认，美方把那些表示愿意遣返的战俘当场打死，以镇压我方被俘人员的正义斗争，但是仍然没有能够达到他们的卑鄙目的。因此，第八军只好“把点数的具体做法掩藏起来，最后糊里糊涂地举出一个数字，说是有五万九千名北朝鲜和中国俘虏，将不‘以暴力拒绝’遣返。后来在三心二意的南朝鲜人中间搜罗了一下，把到北边去的人数增加到七万”。美方为了扣留战俘而制造的所谓“甄别”的丑恶情况，再没有这么暴露得清楚的了。
    在这个方案被我方驳得体无完肤以后，美方就采取连续逃会的办法，同时在其战俘营中疯狂屠杀战俘，并不顾我方警告，片面地先后将三万八千名战俘移交给李承晚匪帮。这一切除了说明美方蓄意利用战俘问题拖延以至破坏停战谈判而外，不可能有任何其他解释。
    美方这种阻挠停战谈判的无耻手段，遭到了全世界人民的反对。美方为了欺骗世界舆论，在七月一日声称愿意“诚意地觅求停战”，可是在行政性会议上，美方却又推翻已获协议的停战协定草案中第五十一款，五十二款所规定的全部遣返战俘的原则，提出八万三千人的遣俘数字，企图扣留百分之二十的朝鲜人民军战俘和百分之六十八的中国人民志愿军战俘。美方并且又把这个方案再一次说成是“坚定的、最后的、不可改变的”，根本拒绝进行任何讨论。从六月七日到十月八日，美方连续用三天、七天、十天休会的方式，使会议前后停顿了七十多天。
    九月二十八日，美方又取消了他们的第二个“不可改变”的方案，提出了所谓三项建议。根据这三项“建议”，战俘仍然被非法地分为愿意遣返的和“拒绝遣返”的两类，而无数事实已经充分证明，“拒绝遣返”只是美方强迫扣留战俘的代名词。因此，美方的所谓新“建议”，实际上是换汤不换药的老一套办法，是绝对不能接受的。但是我方为了满足世界人民对朝鲜停战的渴望，在十月八日的会议上，提出了完全公平合理的新提案，这个提案接受了美方建议中形式上的变动。可是美方谈判首席代表哈利逊竟然毫不注意我方的新提案，拿出早就准备好的中止停战谈判的长篇声明宣读一番，并不等我方发言，迳自离开会场。为了打开被美方硬关上的谈判之门，我方金日成、彭德怀两将军在十月十六日致函美方总司令克拉克，要求恢复停战谈判，但也遭到了克拉克的悍然拒绝。至此，美方利用战俘问题来拖延以至最后破坏停战谈判的阴谋，就完全暴露了。
    停战谈判中战俘问题的全部讨论过程证明：美方为了破坏停战谈判，不惜在会内会外采取出尔反尔，造谣说谎，威胁破坏，“军事压力”等等无耻的流氓手段，不惜用战俘的生命和鲜血来铺平他们破坏谈判的道路。他们的“道德原则”何在？他们的“人道原则”何在？他们已经完全撕毁了他们自己签了字的日内瓦公约。和美方的态度相反，朝中方面在整个谈判过程中坚定不渝地遵守着日内瓦公约，并在公约规定的遣俘原则下尽一切可能作了最大限度的努力来寻求妥协。美方现在公然与全世界人民为敌，悍然关上了停战谈判的大门。全世界人民必须严重警惕美国侵略者的扩大战争的阴谋，起来为按照日内瓦公约的遣俘原则实现朝鲜停战而斗争。
