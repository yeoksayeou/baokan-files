    Strengthening the Party's Communist and Communist Party Education for the Working Masses
    Liu Changsheng, Third Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions
    Shanghai is a large city with a concentration of industries, and the working masses of Shanghai will play a significant role in the country's large-scale economic construction and national industrialization in the future. Therefore, universally and systematically conducting communist and Communist Party education among the working masses in Shanghai, and raising the class consciousness of the working masses, has become a fundamental task of the Shanghai Party organization in the workers' movement.
    Over the past three years, the Shanghai Party organization has done a considerable amount of political education work among the working masses. At the beginning of liberation, in conjunction with the organizational construction of the trade union, basic class enlightenment education such as the history of social development and labor creating the world was widely carried out. In early 1950, in the face of the severe economic difficulties caused by the "February 6th" bombing of Shanghai, class education on resisting bombing and overcoming difficulties was conducted. In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries, a series of patriotic education campaigns were carried out. In particular, in the movements of democratic reforms in factories, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and the campaign to increase production and practice economy, class education was carried out more vividly and extensively. These political education efforts conducted among the working masses in Shanghai have achieved certain successes, playing an active role in raising the class consciousness of workers, in the transformation of old Shanghai and the construction of new Shanghai, in the restoration and development of production, and in responding to and completing the various calls of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government. However, these political education efforts still lacked a comprehensive and systematic plan, and more importantly, they failed to systematically conduct education on communism and the Communist Party among the working masses in a timely and planned manner. Among the leading cadres of some Party organizations and trade unions, they have not yet given due importance to systematically strengthening the political education of the working masses as an important link in the workers' movement.
    The first National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China in May 1951 clearly pointed out that education on communism and the Communist Party should be conducted among all industrial workers. This is very necessary and correct. Systematically conducting propaganda and education on communism and the Communist Party among the working masses should be one of the regular, long-term, and important political tasks of Party organizations at all levels; it should be regarded as an important key for the Party to strengthen its ties with the working masses, lead the working class to realize national industrialization, and move towards socialism and communism.
    Why must the Party attach importance to conducting education on communism and the Communist Party among the working masses? First, because the Party is the advanced and organized force of the working class, and the working class is precisely the class foundation on which the Party grows and relies. Raising the class consciousness and communist political level of the working masses is an important condition for strengthening the Party's strength and close ties with the working masses. Second, our country is facing large-scale economic construction tasks. In order to ensure that our country moves from a new democratic society to a socialist and communist society, it is necessary to clearly resolve the issues of the purpose of production and the future of society in the political thinking of the working class, which is the main force in economic construction. Third, it must also be recognized that the vast working masses were long oppressed, exploited, deceived, and blinded under the reactionary rule, surrounded by the old society. They were not only in a state of enslavement politically and economically, but also suffered distortion and destruction in their ideology and spirit. Therefore, in many workers, there still exist, to varying degrees, non-working-class thoughts left over from the influence of the old society; and today, they still cannot completely get rid of the influence and encirclement of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas. In order to consolidate the leadership of the working class, the working class must be armed with firm communist ideas, on the one hand, to eliminate the influence left over from the old society, and on the other hand, to defeat the invasion of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas at any time. Finally, it must also be admitted that although the working class has the above-mentioned situation, after three years of education by the Party, the political level and class consciousness of the working masses have indeed been greatly improved. Therefore, fragmented political education can no longer meet their current needs. They strongly demand further improvement, that is to say, the working masses are already urgently demanding systematic political study and wanting to understand the principles of communism and the Communist Party.
    Based on the above understanding, the Shanghai Party organization has gradually strengthened its work in this area. During the organizational construction stage of the democratic reform in factories and the ideological construction stage of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, it summarized these movements and used these concrete and vivid summaries as preliminary common knowledge about communism and the Communist Party to conduct education among the working masses. Since May of this year, the Shanghai Workers' Political School has been established to systematically rotate industrial workers' activists for short-term, relatively systematic education on the basic knowledge of communism and the Communist Party. After August of this year, when the work of Party consolidation and Party building began, all factories and factory areas in the city held night Party schools, spare-time political study classes, or spare-time workers' political schools of different sizes, and all used the political theory of communism and the Communist Party as the content of education. The enthusiasm and efforts of the working masses in studying politics are unprecedented and entirely out of their own initiative. Therefore, the number of people in most study classes exceeded the planned quota. Generally speaking, the workers' production tasks are very tight, but they have put forward the slogan "no delay in production and study." After the education on communism and the Communist Party, the class consciousness and production enthusiasm of the working masses have been further improved. Some workers said: "After studying, I clearly understand my future and the purpose of production." Others said: "After studying politics, production has a soul, and it is more energetic to work." The working masses are more closely aligned with the Party. After studying, a large number of outstanding workers have applied to join the Party. In each term of the Shanghai Workers' Political School, more than 80 to 85 percent of the students apply to join the Party, and 40 to 50 percent of the students are approved to join the Party after careful investigation and according to the procedures for joining the Party.
    Based on the past and recent political education among the working masses, we have the following experiences:
    First, we must oppose and overcome some erroneous ideas that hinder political education among the working masses. One is called "no time to study" or "study hinders production." This view of opposing study and production is a tendency to ignore politics. One is not starting from the actual level and needs of the workers, but from subjective imagination. When political education is mentioned, it is just moving books, "understand or not, three o'clock." A lot of work is done, but the effect is very poor. This is a tendency of dogmatism. One is to be satisfied with what to teach, fragmentary contact with reality, and deny the need for systematic political education. This can only "see the trees but not the forest" and cannot improve. If these irresponsible attitudes towards the working class politically are not overcome, the political education of workers cannot be done well.
    Second, in our practice, it has been fully proven that it is not only very necessary, but also easy to be accepted to conduct primary and relatively systematic education on communism and the Communist Party among workers. Today, although the theoretical level of workers is low, their perceptual knowledge of production and class struggle is very rich. In addition, they also have many excellent class characteristics. In a certain sense, our education is to help the working masses summarize and improve many rich but fragmented perceptual knowledge, clarify vague ideas, and make them reach a more systematic rational understanding. Therefore, starting to conduct education on communism and the Communist Party among workers should start from the characteristics of the development of workers' thinking, and the principle of "less but refined, simple and clear" should be grasped in the content of education; the principle of "from near to far, from shallow to deep" should be grasped in the implementation of education. That is to say, we must both recognize that conducting education on communism and the Communist Party among workers is a long-term political task and should be unremittingly worked hard, and we must proceed from reality and gradually improve it so that it can be "eaten and digested."
    Third, in order to achieve good results in education, we should pay attention to grasping the policy of "positive education as the main focus" throughout the education process. It should be admitted that today, various non-working-class thoughts and styles still exist to varying degrees among the working masses, and this must be examined and criticized; but in the past education, due to inappropriately emphasizing the exposure of thoughts, the working masses only saw the shortcomings and negative aspects, resulting in loss of confidence and pessimistic emotions, and even denying good performance. We must clearly recognize that the purpose of conducting education on communism and the Communist Party among the working masses is to actively improve the political consciousness of the working masses, and ideological examination and criticism are precisely to achieve this goal. So how can we more consciously and correctly criticize incorrect ideas without getting more and more confused? The basic thing is to improve the correct understanding. Only by understanding scientific communism can we powerfully criticize utopian communism and eliminate the ideas of viewing communism from the perspective of small production or egalitarianism. Therefore, improving understanding from a positive perspective, clarifying the truth, and praising exemplary figures and events should become the main and basic aspects of education.
    Fourth, the method of conducting political education among the working masses must resolutely implement the policy of linking theory with practice. According to the experience of the Shanghai Workers' Political School or other political study classes, in addition to adopting the step of repeated education of "first positive enlightenment, then supplementary explanation, decentralized discussion, and finally summary and improvement," a comparative teaching method should also be adopted in each lesson (comparing old China and new China, comparing advanced and backward, etc.), an image-based teaching method (in coordination with the content of each lesson, screening movies in a planned way, organizing photo exhibitions, and organizing discussions, etc.), and a method of mass education (typical complaints, old workers reporting on the deeds of workers' struggles, labor models who have been to the Soviet Union reporting on Soviet construction, etc.). These methods enable the workers to more deeply understand the content of education, just as people eat things and need to be digested by various organs. The better the digestion, the more nutrients are absorbed. Political education must also adopt various effective methods suitable for the working masses so that they can understand it and generate power. The simple method of "the teacher speaks and the students listen" is quick and convenient, but the effect is not great.
    The problem is very clear. Whether from the needs of the working class today and tomorrow, or from the future of national development, our Party organizations at all levels and trade unions at all levels under the leadership of the Party should, according to the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, strengthen the education of the working class on communism and the Communist Party from the perspective of guiding ideology and practical actions.

    加强党对工人群众的共产主义和共产党的教育
    中共上海市委第三书记  上海总工会主席  刘长胜
    上海市是产业集中的大城市，上海市的工人群众在今后国家大规模经济建设和国家工业化的过程中将起重大的作用。因此，在上海市的工人群众中普遍地系统地进行共产主义和共产党的教育，提高工人群众的阶级觉悟，就成为上海市党组织在工人运动中的一项基本任务。
    上海市的党组织三年来已在工人群众中做了不少政治教育工作：在解放之初，结合着工会的组织建设，曾普遍地进行了社会发展史、劳动创造世界等基本的阶级启蒙教育；在一九五○年初，“二六”轰炸造成上海经济严重困难的情况下，进行过反轰炸和克服困难的阶级教育；在抗美援朝、镇压反革命运动中，进行过一系列的爱国主义教育；尤其是在工厂民主改革、“三反”、“五反”、增产节约等运动中，更加生动地广泛地进行了阶级教育。在上海工人群众中所进行的这些政治教育，是有一定的成绩的，对于提高工人的阶级觉悟，对于旧上海的改造和新上海的建设，对于恢复和发展生产，对于响应和完成毛主席、共产党与人民政府的各项号召，都起了积极的作用。但是这些政治教育，还是缺乏通盘的系统的计划，更没有能够及时地有计划地在工人群众中进行系统的关于共产主义和共产党的教育。在某些党组织和工会的领导干部中，也还没有把系统地加强工人群众的政治教育作为工人运动的重要环节而予以应有的重视。
    一九五一年五月的中国共产党第一次全国宣传工作会议，曾明确地指出：要向全体产业工人进行关于共产主义和共产党的教育。这是非常必要和正确的。在工人群众中系统地进行关于共产主义和共产党的宣传教育，应该是党的各级组织经常的长期的重要政治任务之一；应该看作是党加强和工人群众的联系、领导工人阶级实现国家工业化，走向社会主义和共产主义的重要关键。
    为什么党必须重视在工人群众中进行关于共产主义和共产党的教育呢？首先因为党是工人阶级先进的有组织的部队，而工人阶级正是党所生长、所依靠的阶级基础。提高工人群众的阶级觉悟和共产主义的政治水平，是加强党的力量、密切党和工人群众联系的重要条件。其次，我们的国家正面临着大规模的经济建设任务，为了保证我们国家从新民主主义社会走向社会主义、共产主义社会，就必须在经济建设的主力军——工人阶级的政治思想上明确解决生产的目的和社会前途的问题。第三，还必须看到，广大的工人群众过去长期地处在反动统治之下，在旧社会包围之中受压迫、受剥削、被欺骗、被蒙蔽，他们不仅在政治上和经济上处于被奴役的地位，而且在思想上、精神上也遭受了歪曲和摧残，因而在不少工人中也还或多或少地存在着由旧社会影响而遗留下来的非工人阶级的思想；而且今天他们也还不能完全摆脱资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的影响和包围。为了巩固工人阶级的领导权，工人阶级必须有坚强的共产主义思想武装，一面清除旧社会所遗留下来的影响，一面随时打败资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的侵袭。最后，还必须承认一个事实，这就是工人阶级虽然有上述的情况，然而三年来，在党的教育下，工人群众的政治水平和阶级觉悟终究是已经大大提高了，因而零碎片断的政治教育已经不能满足他们今天的要求，他们强烈地要求进一步的提高，也就是说，工人群众已经迫切地在要求系统的学习政治，要求懂得共产主义和共产党的道理。
    基于以上的认识，上海市的党组织已逐渐地在加强这一方面的工作，在工厂民主改革的组织建设阶段和“三反”、“五反”运动的思想建设阶段，都对这些运动进行了总结，并以此具体生动的总结，作为关于共产主义和共产党的初步的常识，在工人群众中进行教育。又从今年五月起，举办了上海市工人政治学校，有计划地轮流抽调产业工人积极分子进行短期的、比较系统的关于共产主义和共产党基础知识的教育。在今年八月以后，当整党建党工作开始的时候，全市各工厂和工厂区都分别举办了规模大小不同的夜党校、业余政治学习班或业余工人政治学校，并都以共产主义和共产党的政治理论作为教育内容。工人群众学习政治的热情和努力是前所未有的，而且完全是出于自觉的。因而大部分的学习班人数都超过了预定的名额。一般说，工人的生产任务是很紧张的，但是他们提出了“生产学习两不误”的口号。经过了关于共产主义和共产党的教育，工人群众的阶级觉悟和生产积极性更加提高了，有的工人说：“经过学习，明确认识了自己的前途和生产的目的。”也有的说：“学习了政治，生产有了灵魂，干起来更有劲。”工人群众对党更加亲近了，经过学习，大批的优秀工人纷纷要求入党。上海工人政治学校每一期都有百分之八十到八十五以上的学员申请入党，并有百分之四十到五十的学员经过慎重考察、按照入党手续、被批准入党。
    根据过去和最近在工人群众中进行政治教育的情况，我们有如下几个体验：
    首先必须反对和克服阻碍在工人群众中进行政治教育的一些错误观念。一种叫做“没有时间学习”或“学习妨碍生产”。这种把学习和生产对立起来的看法，是一种忽视政治的倾向。一种是不从工人的实际水平和需要出发，而是从主观想像出发，一提政治教育就是搬书，“懂不懂，三点钟”，做得不少，效果很差，这是教条主义的倾向。一种是满足于做什么教什么，片断的联系实际，否认系统地进行政治教育的必要，这也就只能“见木不见林”，不能提高。这些对工人阶级政治上不负责的态度，如果不加以克服，就不能做好工人的政治教育工作。
    其次，在我们实践中完全证明，在工人中进行初级的，又较有系统的关于共产主义和共产党的教育，不但十分需要，而且是容易被接受的。今天，工人的理论水平虽较低，但关于生产和阶级斗争的感性知识却很丰富，另外，他们还有许多优良的阶级特点。在一定意义上说，我们的教育就是帮助工人群众将许多丰富的但是片断的零碎的感性知识，加以总结和提高，澄清模糊的思想，使之达到较系统的理性认识。因此，开始在工人中进行关于共产主义和共产党的教育，应该从工人思想发展的特点出发，在教育内容上要掌握“少而精，简而明”的原则；在教育的实施上要掌握“由近到远，由浅入深”的原则。也就是说，既要认识在工人中进行共产主义和共产党的教育是长期的政治任务，应该不懈地努力，而又要从实际出发，逐步提高，使之“吃下去消化得了”。
    第三，要使教育获得好的效果，应在教育过程中自始至终注意掌握“正面教育为主”的方针。应当承认，今天在工人群众中仍或多或少地存留着各种非工人阶级的思想和作风，这是必须进行检查和批判的；但在过去的教育中，曾由于不适当地强调了暴露思想，结果使工人群众只看到缺点和消极的一面，以致丧失信心和产生悲观情绪，甚至将好的表现也加以否定。我们必须明确认识在工人群众中进行关于共产主义和共产党的教育的目的，是在于积极地提高工人群众的政治觉悟，而思想检查和批判，也正是为了要达到这个目的。那么怎样才能更自觉更正确地批判不正确的思想而不致越弄越乱呢？基本的就是要提高正确的认识，只有懂得了科学的共产主义，才能有力地批判空想的共产主义和消除以小生产或平均主义的观点来看共产主义的思想。所以，从正面来提高认识，弄清道理，表扬模范人物事例，应成为教育的主要方面和基本方面。
    第四，在工人群众中进行政治教育的方法，必须坚决贯彻理论和实际相联系的方针。根据上海工人政治学校或其他政治学习班的经验，除采取“先正面启发，再补充解释、分散讨论，最后总结提高”的反复教育的步骤外，还应在各课教学中采取对比的教学方法（旧中国和新中国对比，先进和落后对比等等），形象化的教学方法（配合各课内容，有计划地放映电影，组织图片展览并组织讨论等等）和群众教育群众的方法（典型诉苦，老工人报告工人斗争事绩，到过苏联的劳动模范报告苏联建设等）。这些方法，使工人们能更深刻地理解教育内容，这正像人吃了东西要经过各个器官消化，消化越好吸收养料就越多。进行政治教育也必须采用适合工人群众的各种有效方法，使其理解，才能产生力量，单纯的“先生讲，学生听”的办法，虽也轻快便当，但收效是不大的。
    问题非常明显，不论从工人阶级今天和明天的需要来看，从国家发展的前途来看，我们党的各级组织和党领导下的各级工会，都应当根据毛主席和党中央的指示，从领导思想和实际行动中加强对工人阶级的关于共产主义和共产党的教育。
