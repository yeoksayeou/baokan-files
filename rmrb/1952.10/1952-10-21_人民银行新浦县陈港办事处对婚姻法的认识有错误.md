    The Chengang Office of the People's Bank of Xinpu County has an incorrect understanding of the Marriage Law
    Editor: The Chengang Office of the Xinpu County Branch of the People's Bank of China in Shandong Province has a situation that violates the Marriage Law. Sun Zhanzhong, a female cadre in the office, was divorced from her former husband by a judgment of the Guanyun County People's Court in Northern Jiangsu (with a court certificate). Afterwards, she fell in love with Zhang Fan from the Huaibei Salt Special Zone of Northern Jiangsu. One Sunday, Sun Zhanzhong and Zhang Fan went out for a walk, and upon their return, they were severely criticized administratively by the office, saying that her divorce certificate was "invalid" and that falling in love was "violating the Marriage Law." The office's Communist Youth League organization said that she did not ask for leave when going out (Sundays are holidays, and it is not necessary to ask for leave to go out), which was "undisciplined," and gave her a "warning" at the CYL branch meeting. The way this office treats the Marriage Law and the love of young men and women is obviously wrong. It is suggested that the leadership of the office and the superior CYL organization should examine and correct this.　Ai Ming

    人民银行新浦县陈港办事处对婚姻法的认识有错误
    编辑同志：中国人民银行山东省新浦县支行陈港办事处有违反婚姻法的情形。该办事处女干部孙展中，经苏北区灌云县人民法院判决和原夫离婚（有法院证明）后，和苏北区淮北盐特区张范发生恋爱。有一个星期日，孙展中和张范出外游玩，回来便受到本机关行政上的严厉批评，说她的离婚证明书“无效”，谈恋爱是“违反婚姻法”。该办事处的青年团组织说她外出没请假（星期日放假，外出本不必请假），是“无纪律”，在团分支部会上，给她以“警告处分”。该办事处这样地对待婚姻法，对待青年男女的恋爱，显然是错误的。建议该办事处的领导方面和上级团组织予以检查纠正。　艾明
