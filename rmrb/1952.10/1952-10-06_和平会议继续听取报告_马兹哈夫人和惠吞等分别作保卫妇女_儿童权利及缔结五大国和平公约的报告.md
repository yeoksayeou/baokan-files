Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference continued its fourth day of meetings at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 5th. All delegates listened to reports on the seventh and eighth agenda items, namely reports and supplementary reports on the protection of women's and children's welfare, and reports and supplementary reports on the conclusion of a five-power peace pact.

    The executive chairpersons for today's meeting were: I.I. Anisimov (Soviet Union), Noha Fonshavan (Laos), Manuel Agustín Aguirre (Ecuador), Qasim al-Samawi (Iraq), Bir Shahab Mankey Sharif (Pakistan), Mario Sciabola (Peru).

    The meeting was first chaired by I.I. Anisimov, head of the Soviet delegation and member of the Soviet Peace Committee. The entire audience listened with great concern to the three reports on the seventh agenda item—the protection of women's and children's welfare. Each speaker was warmly welcomed, and their reports repeatedly drew storms of applause.

    Mrs. Tahira Mazhar of the Pakistani delegation first took the stage to deliver a report on protecting women's rights and children's welfare (full text to be published separately). Mrs. Tahira Mazhar listed a large number of facts and figures illustrating the tragic fate of women and children in many Asian countries, facing hunger, death, and being deprived of education under the conditions of aggressive wars and war preparations. On the other hand, in the Soviet Union and New China, women have been completely liberated, and children's welfare has been guaranteed. Mrs. Tahira Mazhar emphasized: The women's movement in every Asian country increasingly deeply feels that the prerequisite for protecting women's rights and children's welfare is the establishment of lasting peace. Mrs. Tahira Mazhar called on kind men and women in the Asian and Pacific regions, and around the world, to concentrate their efforts and unite to protect the interests of mothers and children, oppose war preparations and war propaganda, end the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, eliminate the burden of armaments, prohibit the use of atomic weapons, chemical weapons, and bacteriological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and demand that all national governments ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol. Finally, Mrs. Tahira Mazhar paid tribute to outstanding leaders of the international women's movement, including Soong Ching Ling, Mrs. Gordon, Kosmodemyanskaya (mother of Soviet heroes Zoya and Shura), Park Jeong-ae, Anna Seghers (famous German anti-fascist female writer), Mrs. Felton, and Mrs. Bass (Progressive Party vice-presidential candidate of the United States). When the names of these women leaders were mentioned, the audience applauded enthusiastically.

    As Mrs. Tahira Mazhar stepped down from the podium, the American female delegate Celene excitedly embraced her, and the Chinese female delegates Li Dequan and Deng Yingchao also warmly embraced her. Continuous applause resounded throughout the venue.

    Next, Mrs. Smith of the New Zealand delegation delivered a supplementary report on protecting women's and children's rights (full text to be published separately). She first praised the happiness of women and children in New China, saying: We are excited about the tremendous progress in the lives and welfare of women and children in New China. The complete freedom and equality they now enjoy inspires those of us in countries that have not yet achieved these rights. Mrs. Smith pointed out: Women and children in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya are suffering cruel devastation in the war, and in the South Pacific countries, women and children are also being threatened due to the implementation of war preparation policies. She said: A certain insidious war from the United States is directly threatening our children. She also condemned the poisoning of children by the so-called American way of life. She emphasized: Protecting women and children is protecting the future of mankind. Women do not want their children to be raised only to have them sent to foreign battlefields to die. Women all over the world demand peace, and as long as they work together, they can and will win peace.

    The reporter of the second supplementary report on the protection of women's and children's welfare (full text to be published separately) was Emilia Prieto Tugores, Deputy Head of the Costa Rican delegation and President of the Costa Rican National Peace Council. In her report, she described the tragic situation of women and children in semi-feudal and semi-colonial Latin America. Prieto said: This situation can only be resolved in an atmosphere of peace, because only in an atmosphere of peace can the welfare of the people be truly taken care of.

    As soon as the report ended, a group of spirited and smiling young men and women walked into the venue. They were outstanding young workers, farmers, outstanding students, and young athletes who had returned from participating in the International Olympic Games from Beijing. Amidst the pleasant applause of the entire audience, they walked onto the stage and presented flowers to the presidium. A great applause erupted throughout the venue. An innocent girl repeatedly embraced Anisimov, head of the Soviet delegation, who was the executive chairman, in a warm manner. The entire venue was immersed in a storm of joyous applause for several minutes.

    After a break, the meeting continued at 5:30 PM, chaired by Noha Fonshavan, head of the Lao delegation.

    The conference began to hear a report on the need to conclude a five-power peace pact (full text to be published separately). The reporter was Louis Hewetson, head of the U.S. delegation. As this Black American peace warrior stepped onto the podium, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly.

    Hewetson first pointed out: The people of our region have a common need and interest, which is peace. We are in a tense situation and must bring the leaders of the five great powers together at a conference table to discuss. The time for doing so has come. Hewetson pointed out: Due to the lack of a five-power agreement, the United Nations has been turned into a caricature that distorts the hopes of the people of all countries. To restore the true function of the United Nations, an agreement between the major powers is needed. This first requires the People's China to occupy a position in the United Nations as the true spokesperson for all the Chinese people. He said: The People's China has been recognized by countries that account for half of the world's population; how can one talk about the United Nations if one does not recognize this desire of the people of all countries? Hewetson emphasized that the urgency of a five-power agreement also exceeds all political issues. It is not, and cannot be, the special interest of any political or economic bloc. It is a matter of life and death for the people of the world, and it is the desire of all nations.

    Hewetson then analyzed the difficult situation of the American people and the people of Western Europe and Latin American countries due to the war preparations being carried out by the U.S. government. He said: What threatens the democratic hopes of the people of our countries, plunders and harms the economies of our countries, and hinders the political development of our countries is the war preparations being carried out by the United States. To eliminate this threat, an agreement must be reached among the major powers. The conclusion of a five-power peace pact will open up a new era for us. Hewetson finally emphasized amidst warm applause: The world needs a peaceful competition, in which everyone can freely contribute to solving everyone's problems. We all have expectations for this conference and are working towards it. This is the first time in history that the people have enough power to turn the tide. Alleviate tensions and promote the realization of a peace pact.

    Next, Wu La, a representative from Myanmar, a member of the World Peace Council, and a member of the Executive Committee of the Myanmar Peace Conference, made a supplementary report on the issue of concluding a five-power peace pact (full text to be published separately). Wu La explained that the people of Southeast Asia urgently demanded the conclusion of a five-power peace pact. Wu La pointed out: The immoral bacteriological warfare, the genocidal massacres and mad acts of destruction carried out in Korea, and the long-term barbaric attacks on the people of Vietnam and Malaya, are by no means something that peace-loving countries can do. On the other hand, if it is said that the Soviet Union and China, who are busy engaged in construction, want to engage in war, that is unimaginable. Wu La said: The people of Myanmar, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and the three countries that recently signed the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand "Tripartite Security Treaty" do not want to see their children grow up and be slaughtered by some new bomb. They must demand that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France confer with the Soviet Union and China to promote a five-power peace pact. Wu La emphatically pointed out: We must unite to make the struggle for a five-power pact a part of the struggle for peace. Wu La concluded his report with enthusiastic applause from all.

    Finally, Deputy Secretary-General Hai Xuan read out congratulatory messages from the All-Nepal Peace Council, Mrs. Gordon, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the Japan Democratic Women's Association, the German Democratic Women's League, the Korean Democratic Women's League, the Italian Women's League, the Chilean Women's Popular Front, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Ceylon Asian Peace Committee, and the Netherlands Peace Council. These congratulatory messages were all warmly welcomed.

    The meeting was adjourned.

    和平会议继续听取报告
    马兹哈夫人和惠吞等分别作保卫妇女
    儿童权利及缔结五大国和平公约的报告
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第四日会议于五日下午三时半继续举行。全体代表听取了关于第七项议题和第八项议题的报告，即关于保卫妇女及儿童福利的报告和补充报告，及关于缔结五大国和平公约的报告和补充报告。
    今日会议的执行主席是：伊·伊·阿尼西莫夫（苏联），诺哈·冯沙万（寮国），曼努爱尔·阿古斯丁·阿吉勒（厄瓜多尔），加吉姆·艾尔·萨马威（伊拉克），毕尔·沙哈布·曼基·沙里夫（巴基斯坦），马里奥·齐亚布拉（秘鲁）。
    会议首先由苏联代表团团长、苏联拥护和平委员会委员阿尼西莫夫任执行主席。全场以极为关切的心情听取了关于第七项议题——保卫妇女及儿童福利问题的三个报告，每一个报告人都受到热烈的欢迎，她们的报告曾一再博得暴风雨般的掌声。
    巴基斯坦代表塔希拉·马兹哈夫人首先上台作关于保卫妇女权利和儿童福利的报告（全文另发）。塔希拉·马兹哈夫人列举了大量事实和数字，说明亚洲许多国家的妇女和儿童，在侵略战争和备战政策下所面临的饥饿、死亡、失学的悲惨命运。而另一方面，在苏联和新中国，妇女已得到完全解放，儿童福利获得了保证。塔希拉·马兹哈夫人着重地说：每一个亚洲国家的妇女运动越来越深刻地感觉到：保卫妇女权利和保卫儿童福利的先决条件是建立持久的和平。塔希拉·马兹哈夫人号召亚洲及太平洋区域以及全世界善良的男女们集中力量、团结起来，保卫母亲和儿童的利益，反对备战和战争宣传，结束在朝鲜、越南和马来亚的战争，取消军备负担，禁止使用原子武器、化学武器和细菌武器等大规模毁灭人类的武器，要求所有国家政府批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书。最后，塔希拉·马兹哈夫人向国际妇女运动的杰出领袖宋庆龄、戈登夫人、柯斯莫捷绵斯卡亚（苏联英雄卓娅与舒拉的母亲）、朴正爱、西格斯（德国著名的反法西斯女作家）、费尔顿夫人和巴斯夫人（美国进步党副总统候选人）致敬。当提到这些妇女领袖的名字时，听众热烈鼓掌。
    在塔希拉·马兹哈夫人走下讲台时，美国女代表塞尔奈激动地和她拥抱，中国女代表李德全、邓颖超也和她热情拥抱，会场上响起持久不息的掌声。
    接着，新西兰代表史密斯夫人作关于保卫妇女儿童权利的补充报告（全文另发）。她首先就称颂新中国妇女和儿童的幸福，她说：我们对新中国妇女和儿童的生活和福利的巨大进步，感到兴奋。他们现在所享受的完全的自由和平等，鼓舞了我们这些还没有取得这些权利的国家的人们。史密斯夫人指出：朝鲜、越南和马来亚的妇女和儿童正在战争中遭受着残酷的摧残，而在南太平洋国家，由于备战政策的实施，妇女和儿童也正受到威胁。他说：来自美国的某种阴险的战争正直接威胁着我们的儿童。她还谴责所谓美国生活方式对儿童的毒害。她强调：保卫妇女与儿童就是保卫人类的未来。妇女不愿意孩子抚养长大后又让他们到外国的战场上去送命。全世界的妇女要求和平，只要她们共同努力，就能够而且一定会赢得和平。
    关于保卫妇女及儿童福利的第二个补充报告（全文另发）的报告人，是哥斯达黎加代表团副团长、哥斯达黎加全国和平理事会主席艾米利亚·普利艾多·图戈莱斯。她在报告中说明了半封建半殖民地的拉丁美洲，妇女和儿童的悲惨情况。普利艾多说：这种情况只能在和平的空气中得到解决，因为在和平空气中人民的福利才真正地能得到照顾。
    报告刚刚结束，会场中走进了一队精神焕发、满脸笑容的男女青年。他们是北京市优秀的青年工人、农民、优秀的学生和参加国际奥林匹克运动会归来的青年运动员。他们在全场愉快的掌声中走上主席台，向主席团献花。全场爆发大鼓掌。一个天真的女孩子一再亲热地拥抱执行主席、苏联的代表团团长阿尼西莫夫。全场浸没在暴风雨般的欢愉的掌声中达数分钟之久。
    会议在休息后于五时三十分继续进行，由寮国代表团团长诺哈·冯沙万任执行主席。
    大会开始听取关于需要缔结五大国和平公约的报告（全文另发）。报告人是美国代表团团长路易士·惠吞。这位美国黑人和平战士一走上讲台，全场即起立热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    惠吞首先指出：我们这个区域的人民都有一个共同的需要和利益，那就是和平。我们正处在一个紧张的局势中，必须使五大国的领袖们同在一个会议桌上来商谈。这样做的时机已经来到了。惠吞指出：由于没有五大国协议，联合国已被变成歪曲各国人民的希望的一幅讽刺画。要使联合国恢复其真正的功能，就需要各大国间的协议。这首先需要人民中国在联合国中占有地位，作为全体中国人民的真正发言人。他说：人民中国已经被占全世界人类一半的国家所承认；如果不承认各国人民的这种愿望，又怎么能谈得上联合国呢？惠吞强调说：五大国协议的迫切性也超过所有的政治问题。它不是、也不可能是任何一个政治或经济集团的特殊利益。它是全世界人民的生死问题，也是所有民族的愿望。
    惠吞接着分析了由于美国政府进行战争准备，美国人民及西欧和拉丁美洲国家人民的困难处境。他说：威胁着我们各国人民的民主希望，劫掠并残害我们各国人民的经济，妨碍我们各国人民政治发展的，是美国所进行的战争准备。要消除这个威胁，就必须各大国获致协议。五大国缔结一个和平公约会给我们开辟一个新的时代。惠吞最后在热烈的掌声中强调说：世界需要的是和平竞赛，在这个竞赛中，每个人都可自由地为解决大家的问题而出力。我们对这次大会都寄予期望并正在为它而工作。这是历史上第一次，人民有足够强大的力量来扭转时局。缓和紧张局势，促使一个和平公约的实现。
    接着，缅甸代表、世界和平理事会理事、缅甸和平大会执行委员吴拉作了关于缔结五大国和平公约问题的补充报告（全文另发）。吴拉说明东南亚人民迫切地要求缔结五大国和平公约。吴拉指出：不道德的细菌战争，在朝鲜所进行的灭种屠杀和疯狂的毁灭行为，以及对越南和马来亚人民长期的野蛮攻击，决不是重视和平的国家所能做出来的事。而另一方面，如果说正在忙着从事建设的苏联和中国想要从事战争，那是不可想像的事。吴拉说：缅甸、泰国、菲律宾、印尼和最近签订了美、澳、新“三国安全条约”的三个国家的人民，没有谁愿意看见他们的儿女长大成人而被某种新的炸弹所屠杀。他们必须要求美、英、法三国政府和苏联及中国会商，促成五大国和平公约。吴拉着重指出：我们必须团结起来，使争取五大国公约的斗争成为争取和平的斗争的一部分。吴拉结束他的报告时，全体报以热烈的鼓掌。
    最后，副秘书长哈伊宣读了全尼泊尔和平理事会、国际民主妇女联合会主席戈登夫人、日本民主妇女协议会、德意志民主妇女联盟、朝鲜民主妇女同盟、意大利妇女联盟、智利妇女人民阵线、中华全国总工会、锡兰亚洲和平委员会、荷兰和平理事会发来的贺电，这些贺电都受到热烈的欢迎。
    会议至此宣告休会。
