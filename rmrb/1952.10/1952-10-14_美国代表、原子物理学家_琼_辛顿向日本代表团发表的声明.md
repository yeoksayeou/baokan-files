    American Representative and Atomic Physicist
    Joan Hinton's Statement to the Japanese Delegation
    In memory of the millions of innocent people, children, the elderly, and men and women from all walks of life, in memory of those who were brutally murdered and arbitrarily burned to death in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, I am very willing to say a few words to the Japanese scientists through the Japanese representatives attending this peace conference.
    As a scientist who worked at the Los Alamos atomic bomb testing ground in New Mexico, and as someone who personally came into contact with the bomb dropped on Nagasaki, I deeply feel guilty and ashamed because I myself participated in this crime against all humanity, especially against the Japanese people.
    But why did I, and almost all American physicists, participate directly or indirectly in the production of this horrific weapon of mass destruction during World War II? Perhaps my own experience can serve as an excellent practical illustration for everyone.
    From the earliest age I can remember, I had a very strong desire to know how the world was made up, so I decided to become a scientist. But the deeper I delved into scientific research, the more I became immersed in the idea of "science for science's sake." This view is a poison to modern science. It was because of this mistaken notion, separating science from society, from humanity, and from people's lives, that I participated in the work of making the atomic bomb during the war. At that time, like many of my colleagues, I believed that the work of us scientists was only to find out the truth of nature. As for other things, such as how to apply the knowledge we scientists discovered, that was secondary to us. In our pure scientific research, we had no time to care about those trivial matters. The practical application of science should be a matter for politicians and engineers.
    It is shameful to say that the tragedies of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki awakened me from my sweet dream in the ivory tower, and made me fundamentally realize that there is no such thing as "pure" science in the world; that science would have no meaning whatsoever except to serve humanity and help create a rich and beautiful new world.
    Here I want to say a few words to the scientists in Japan and the United States, those who are still engaged in the research of atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and bacteriological warfare: "Please think again about what you are doing now! You may think that you have gained scientific prestige by sending batches of documents marked 'Confidential' into the safes of the American military, but this completely false and shameful reputation is only an illusion, and it will soon be shattered by the resentment of the people of the world.
    I want to shake hands with all those who refuse to participate in this harmful activity, and I want to say to them: let us work harder to strive for the prohibition of atomic bombs, bacteriological warfare, and all weapons of mass destruction!

### 美国代表、原子物理学家  琼·辛顿向日本代表团发表的声明

    美国代表、原子物理学家
    琼·辛顿向日本代表团发表的声明
    为了纪念千千万万无辜的人民、儿童、老人和各界的男女，纪念那些在广岛和长崎被残酷地杀害、被任意烧死的人，我很愿意通过出席这次和平会议的日本代表，对日本的科学家们讲几句话。
    作为一个在新墨西哥州罗萨拉摩斯原子弹实验场工作的科学家；作为一个曾经亲手接触过丢在长崎的那颗炸弹的人，我深深的感到有罪，感到羞耻，因为我自己参与了这个对全人类、尤其是对日本人民所犯下的罪行。
    但到底为什么我和几乎所有的美国物理学家们，都会在第二次世界大战中、间接或直接地参与了这个骇人听闻的大规模杀人武器的制造工作呢？也许，我自己的经历就可以作为对大家的一个极好的实际说明。
    早在我刚有记忆的时候，我就有一种极强烈的愿望，要想知道世界到底是怎样组成的，于是我决心要做一个科学家。但是对科学研究的越深，我却越是沉入那种“为科学而科学”的观点里去。这种观点乃是对于现代科学的毒害。而我就是由于有了这个错误的观念，把科学同社会隔离、把科学同人类、同人的生活隔离，我才会在大战期间参加了制造原子弹的工作。当时我跟我的许多同事一样，都认为我们科学家的工作只不过是要找出自然界的真理。至于此外的事情，如怎样去应用我们科学家所发现的知识，那对我们是次要的事了。在我们从事纯科学的研究中，我们是没有时间去关心那些琐碎事情的。科学的实际应用问题应该是政治家和工程师们的事。
    说来真感到可耻，广岛和长崎被炸的惨祸，才把我从象牙之塔的酣梦中震醒过来；才使我从根本上认识到，世界上是根本没有什么“纯”科学这个东西的；认识到科学除开为人类服务，并帮助创造一个丰富的、美丽的新世界以外，就不会再有任何意义。
    这里我要向在日本和美国的科学家们，那些直到现在还正从事于研究原子弹、氢弹和细菌战争的科学家们讲几句话：“请你们再想一下你们现在究竟在干些什么！你们也许以为，你们把一批批标着
    “密件”字样的文件送入美国军部的保险箱里，你们就取得科学的声誉了，但是这个完全虚假的、可耻的名誉只不过是一个幻影，它会很快就被全世界人民的愤恨所粉碎无遗的。
    我要跟所有拒绝参加这种害人勾当的人握手，我要向他们说：让我们更加努力争取禁止原子弹、细菌战争和一切大规模杀人武器！
