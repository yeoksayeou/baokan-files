Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: The nine representatives of the Ceylon delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference issued the following statement on the 16th before leaving Beijing to visit various places:

	We, the Ceylon Peace Delegation, have stayed in new China for nearly thirty days and will soon be leaving this great country. Although we have spent most of our time participating in the Peace Conference, we have still had many opportunities to study and understand new China. We have visited many interesting places; carefully studied several important aspects of life in new China; and discussed matters of common concern with leaders of mass organizations such as trade unions, farmers' associations, women's federations, and student groups.

	We have observed the work of Chinese men and women. We saw their great joy and boundless enthusiasm during the National Day (October 1st) celebrations and during the Peace Conference. We thanked them for their spontaneous welcome and were treated to their generous hospitality. We were enchanted by the laughter of the children of new China. We saw the smiles of satisfaction with their new lives on the faces of the elderly.

	Based on our experiences during this short period, we have no doubt that the men and women of new China have truly been liberated.

	We come from various parts of Ceylon; our political views are not uniform. However, we unanimously and sincerely salute the great Chinese people of the glorious new era!

	We express our satisfaction with the great achievements of the Peace Conference.

	We understand that no matter what happens, China is invincible, and will be invincible in the future. China's sincerity and extremely fervent desire for peace has strengthened our will and made us even more determined to strive to expand the base of our country's peace movement, so that our country's peace movement can more effectively prevent any country from using Ceylon as a base for war.

	Without a doubt, the achievements and victories of the Chinese people will inspire the people of Ceylon in their struggle for peace, independence, and freedom.

    锡兰和平代表团离京前发表声明
    【新华社二十二日讯】参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议锡兰代表团代表九人于十六日离京赴各地参观前发表声明如下：
    我们锡兰和平代表团在新中国逗留了将近三十天，不久就要离开这伟大的国家了。虽然我们大部分时间是用在参加和平会议上面，但是我们仍有许多机会研究和了解新中国。我们曾经访问过许多有趣的地方；仔细研究过新中国生活的几个重要方面；与工会、农会、妇联、学生团体等群众团体的领袖们讨论过大家共同关心的问题。
    我们曾经注意中国男子和妇女工作的情况。我们曾经在国庆节（十月一日）庆祝会上与和平会议期间看到他们的极大愉快和无限热情。我们答谢了他们自发的欢迎并受到他们的丰厚的招待。我们曾经陶醉在新中国儿童的欢笑声中。我们在老年人的脸孔上看到了满意的新生活的微笑。
    根据我们在这短短期间里的种种体验，我们毫不怀疑地相信：新中国的男子和妇女真正获得了解放。
    我们来自锡兰的各个不同的地方；我们的政治见解并非一致。但是，我们一致衷心地向光荣的新时代的伟大中国人民致敬！
    我们对和平会议的伟大成就表示满意。
    我们懂得：无论任何意外发生，中国是不可战胜的，而且将来也是不可战胜的。中国的诚恳和极为热诚的和平愿望，坚强了我们的意志，使我们更要决心争取扩大我国和平运动的基础，使我国和平运动能更有效地制止任何国家利用锡兰作为战争基地。
    毫无疑问：中国人民的成就和胜利，将会鼓舞锡兰人民争取和平、独立和自由的斗争。
