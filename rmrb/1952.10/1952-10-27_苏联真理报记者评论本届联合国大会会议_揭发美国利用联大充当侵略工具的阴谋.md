Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 26th: The Pravda newspaper published in Moscow on the 24th contained a New York dispatch by Klamenov and Litoshko entitled "Thoroughly Expose US Diplomatic Conspiracies!" This dispatch commented on the Seventh UN General Assembly session, stating: The initial sessions of the Seventh UN General Assembly have once again proven that the US rulers are attempting to continue and expand the aggressive war in Korea. The behavior of the US delegation and the speeches of the US representatives particularly highlight this point.

The US representatives stubbornly opposed discussing the proposal put forward by the Polish delegation and supported by the Soviet delegation, which provided a basis for a Korean armistice.

US Secretary of State Acheson's lengthy and vapid speech at the UN General Assembly barely touched on the Korean armistice, only engaging in empty talk about so-called "fair conditions." He intentionally avoided mentioning the conditions that could enable both sides to reach an agreement on a Korean armistice. Acheson withheld the letter from Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to US Commander Clark, preventing the delegates to the General Assembly from knowing it, just as the US government kept this letter from the American people. In this letter, Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai opened the way for an early conclusion of an armistice agreement.

The reporter continued: The next day, Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky exposed the aggressive policy of the United States in attempting to continue the Korean War and publicized the contents of the Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai letter that the State Department had hidden. This action by Vyshinsky caused a great uproar. The following day, newspapers published the contents of Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai's letter to Clark.

This fact, revealed by the Soviet representative, proves that the US ruling clique is not only playing tricks in the Panmunjom negotiations but also at the UN General Assembly, even attempting to deceive and confuse their allies. Using all kinds of conspiracies, blackmail, and intimidation, they stubbornly attempt to use the United Nations as a tool to implement their aggressive policies.

With the docile support of the representatives of Britain, France, and other vassal states, the US representatives have exhausted all kinds of conspiracies and tricks to delay the UN's discussion of the Korean issue. In this regard, they are using last year's methods. There are two reasons that can explain their behavior.

First, US monopoly capitalists fear that open discussion of this issue at the UN will have an adverse impact on the presidential election.

Second, discussing the Korean issue may force US diplomacy to expose its own faults. In the discussion, it will inevitably be revealed that the Korean War is being waged for the benefit of US monopoly capitalists and at their command. It would then be difficult for the US delegation to deceive world opinion.

Therefore, US representatives are unwilling to openly discuss the Korean issue and prefer to resort to behind-the-scenes tactics and conspiracies. They are using the representatives of Britain, France, Greece, Turkey, Brazil, and other countries dependent on the United States to force the General Assembly to accept their will.

The reporter further pointed out: When US newspapers published Acheson's appeasing and lengthy speech, they precisely singled out the section where he demanded that the US's vassal states increase their contributions to the Korean War. This request is actually the central idea of ​​Acheson's speech and is still often talked about in US newspapers. According to US newspaper commentary, the US diplomatic authorities intend to use this UN General Assembly to achieve this goal.

The US delegation also intends to use this conference to cover up the heinous bacteriological warfare that the US military is currently waging against the Korean and Chinese people under the banner of the United Nations. The US delegation's pretentious proposal to "investigate" the accusations regarding bacteriological warfare in Korea is precisely aimed at this. The State Department's plan is openly and brazenly shameless. US politicians hope that by relying on Acheson's obedient “majority,” they will be able to create a “document” to exonerate the US military, cover up their monstrous crimes in Korea, and enable them to continue conducting bacteriological warfare. The legitimate proposal put forward by the Soviet representative to invite representatives of the Chinese and Korean people to participate in the discussion of this issue alarmed the US-British bloc. US diplomats and their echoers know that if representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China are invited, they will inevitably expose the crimes committed by the US military. That is why US politicians and their echoers want to avoid discussing the Soviet proposal. Just like a few months ago in the Security Council, US diplomats at the Seventh General Assembly are most afraid of meeting representatives of the Korean and Chinese people who have suffered from the inhuman bacteriological weapons used by the US military.

The reporter finally wrote: But the US State Department representatives’ conspiracies cannot deceive the people of the world. The US aggressors' attempt to use the UN facade to cover up their crimes will not succeed. The speeches of the Soviet representatives and the representatives of the People's Democratic countries exposed the conspiracies and tricks of US diplomacy on the Korean issue, forcing them to take off their masks of peace-loving and reveal the true face of aggressive US imperialism.

### 苏联真理报记者评论本届联合国大会会议  揭发美国利用联大充当侵略工具的阴谋

    苏联真理报记者评论本届联合国大会会议
    揭发美国利用联大充当侵略工具的阴谋
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于二十四日刊载了克拉明诺夫及李托希科的一篇题为“彻底揭发美国外交阴谋！”的纽约通讯，这篇通讯就第七届联合国大会会议发表评论说：第七届联合国大会的最初几次会议再度证明了，美国统治者企图继续并扩大朝鲜的侵略战争。美国代表团的行为及美国代表在会上的发言特别突出地表现了这一点。
    美国代表固执地反对讨论波兰代表团所提出的而为苏联代表团所支持的建议，这个建议提供了朝鲜停战的基础。
    美国国务卿艾奇逊在联合国大会上发表的冗长而空洞无味的演说，简直没有谈到朝鲜的停战，只是空谈所谓“公平条件”。他有意绝口不谈那些可以使双方就朝鲜停战取得协议的条件。艾奇逊扣住了金日成与彭德怀给美国司令克拉克的信，不让大会代表们知道，就像美国政府不让美国人民知道这封信一样。在这封信中，金日成和彭德怀为早日缔结停战协议开辟了道路。
    记者接着说：第二天，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基揭露了美国企图继续进行朝鲜战争的侵略政策，并且公布了国务院隐藏起来的金日成与彭德怀的信件的内容。维辛斯基这一行动引起了轩然大波。第二天，报纸上就发表了金日成与彭德怀给克拉克的信件的内容。
    苏联代表揭露出来的这一事实证明，美国统治集团不仅在板门店谈判中玩弄骗局，就是在联合国大会上，也在玩弄骗局，甚至企图欺骗并迷惑他们的盟友。他们使用各种阴谋、敲诈和恫吓，顽固地企图把联合国当作实行他们的侵略政策的工具。
    美国代表在英、法及其他仆从国家代表的驯服支持之下，使尽了各种阴谋诡计，来延缓联合国对于朝鲜问题的讨论。在这方面，他们正在使用去年的手段。有两个理由可以说明他们的行为。
    第一、美国垄断资本家生怕在联合国公开讨论这个问题会对总统选举发生不利的影响。
    第二、讨论朝鲜问题可能迫使美国外交露出自己的马脚。在讨论当中，势必暴露朝鲜战争是为了美国垄断资本家的利益，并且是在他们的命令之下进行的这一事实，美国代表团很难再蒙蔽世界舆论。
    因此，美国代表不愿公开地讨论朝鲜问题，而更愿意采取幕后的手段和阴谋。他们利用英国、法国、希腊、土耳其、巴西和其他依附美国的国家的代表，企图强迫大会接受他们的意志。
    记者进一步指出：美国报纸在发表艾奇逊的笼络人心的长篇演说时，恰恰挑出了他要求美国各附庸国增加它们对朝鲜战争的贡献的一段。这个要求实际上就是艾奇逊演说的中心思想，现在仍然是美国报纸上常常谈到的事。根据美国报纸的言论来看，美国外交当局打算利用本届联合国大会来达到这个目的。
    美国代表团并打算利用这次大会，用联合国的旗帜来掩盖美国军队目前正在对朝鲜和中国人民进行的罪恶的细菌战争。美国代表团那样装腔作势地提出一个建议，主张“调查”有关在朝鲜的细菌战的指责，其目的恰恰就在这里。美国国务院的计划是公然无耻的。美国政客们希望依靠服从艾奇逊的
    “多数”，能够制造出一个“文件”，来替美国军队洗刷，掩盖他们在朝鲜的滔天罪行并使他们能继续进行细菌战。苏联代表所提出的邀请中朝人民代表参加这个问题的讨论的合法建议，使美英集团惊慌失措。美国外交家及他们的应声虫知道假使邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国及中华人民共和国代表的话，他们必然会揭发美军所犯的罪行。这就是为什么美国政客们及他们的应声虫要避免讨论苏联建议的原因。像几个月前在安理会一样，现在在第七届大会上，美国外交家是最怕和遭到美军所使用的惨无人道的细菌武器之害的朝鲜和中国人民的代表见面了。
    记者最后写道：但是美国国务院代表的阴谋欺骗不了世界人民。美国侵略者企图用联合国的幌子掩饰他们的罪行，是不会成功的。苏联代表及人民民主国家代表的演说揭发了美国外交在朝鲜问题上的阴谋诡计，迫使他们不得不摘下爱好和平的假面具，露出侵略成性的美帝国主义的真面目来。
