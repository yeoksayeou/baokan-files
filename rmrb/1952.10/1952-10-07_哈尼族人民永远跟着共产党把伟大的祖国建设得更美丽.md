    To the Editor: I am a youth of the Hani ethnic group from the Daliang Mountains in Yunnan. As National Day approaches, I want to tell you how my family has transformed from a tragic existence into a happy revolutionary family.
    During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, taxes and military provisions were heavy burdens weighing down on the people. Because my family couldn't pay, our only old horse was seized by the Kuomintang, and a small piece of land was also occupied. Our whole family fell into an extremely miserable situation, living on mud mushrooms (a type of plant root) and wild vegetables all year round. My younger brother starved to death. The Kuomintang bandit army, with hearts of wolves and lungs of dogs, even raped my younger sister. Hatred was buried deep in our hearts, but we couldn't find a way out. In 1949, as the Kuomintang reactionaries were dying, they intensified their suppression of the people, looting and killing everywhere. At that time, I learned about the people's guerrilla force led by the Communist Party and joined it as if running towards the sun, wanting to avenge the Kuomintang bandits. Once, I was unfortunately captured by the Kuomintang bandits. The more they tortured me, the more determined I became to fight. Nine months later, the guerrilla force managed to rescue me. Since then, I have been in the guerrilla force, using my own struggle to welcome liberation.
    After my hometown was liberated in 1950, the People's Government sent me to study in the Mengzi Special District in order to cultivate me. In 1951, I was transferred to study at the Southwest Nationalities College; after graduation, I was assigned to study at the Central Nationalities Institute. Through study and more than two years of practical life education, I deeply understand that only by following the Communist Party will ethnic minorities be happy.
    News from my hometown tells me that the Hani people have, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, escaped the disasters of the past and are gradually creating a happy life. My family has become a revolutionary family: my father was elected as the village chief and participated in the Southwest Nationalities visiting group to Beijing this year. My older brother has joined the workforce, and my younger brother is studying at the Yunnan Trading Company training class. Our Hani people, like my family, have come to know the Communist Party from their own personal experiences and are determined to follow the Communist Party forever, and together with all ethnic groups, build our great motherland into something more beautiful.

    哈尼族人民永远跟着共产党把伟大的祖国建设得更美丽
    编辑同志：我是云南大凉山哈尼族的一个青年。在国庆节到来的时候，我要把我家怎样从悲惨生活变成一个幸福的革命家庭的情况告诉你。
    在国民党反动统治时期，捐税、兵粮是压在人民头上的一块千斤重的大石头。我家因为缴不出款，仅有的老马被国民党抢走了，一小块土地也被霸占了。我们全家陷入异常悲惨的境地，一年到头靠吃泥菇（一种植物根）和野菜过活，弟弟就这样活活饿死了。狼心狗肺的国民党匪军，还强奸了我的妹妹。仇恨藏在心底，但我们却找不到活路。一九四九年，国民党反动派到了临死的时候，更变本加厉地镇压人民，到处抢掠烧杀。那时，我知道了共产党领导下的人民游击队的消息，就像奔向太阳一样参加了游击队，要向国民党强盗报仇。有一次，我不幸被国民党匪帮抓住了。它们愈折磨我，我斗争的心情愈坚定。九个月后，游击队设法把我救了出来。此后，我一直在游击队里，用自己的斗争来迎接解放。
    一九五零年我家乡解放后，人民政府为了培养我，就让我到蒙自专区去学习。一九五一年，我又被调到西南民族学院学习；毕业后，被调配到中央民族学院学习。经过学习和两年多来实际生活的教育，我深深懂得了：少数民族只有跟着共产党走才会得到幸福。
    从家乡来的讯息告诉我，哈尼族人民已经在中国共产党的领导下摆脱了过去的灾难，逐步创造着幸福的生活。我家已成了一个革命家庭：父亲被选为乡长，并在今年参加了西南民族参观团到北京来。哥哥参加了工作，弟弟在云南贸易公司训练班学习。我们哈尼族的人民都和我家一样，从切身的生活体验中认识了共产党，决心永远跟着共产党走，和各族人民一起，把伟大的祖国建设得更美丽。
