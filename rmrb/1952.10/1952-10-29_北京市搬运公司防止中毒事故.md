    Beijing Transport Company Prevents Poisoning Accidents
    To the Editor: In the past, the Beijing Transport Company lacked anti-poison equipment and did not adequately educate workers on safety, resulting in several poisoning accidents. Recently, the company invested 150 million yuan in anti-poison equipment and mobilized more than 15,000 transport workers throughout the city to discuss how to prevent poisoning. They formulated work rules for transporting hazardous materials and distributed them to each worker. At the same time, they organized more than 300 experienced and physically strong workers into a specialized transport team to handle the loading and unloading of hazardous materials. This has prevented the occurrence of accidents.

    北京市搬运公司防止中毒事故
    编辑同志：北京市搬运公司过去缺乏防毒设备，又没有很好地对工人进行安全教育，因而发生过多次中毒事故。最近，该公司添置了一亿五千万元的防毒设备，又发动全市一万五千多搬运工人讨论如何防止中毒的问题，制订了搬运危险性物品的工作守则，发给每个工人。同时把有丰富经验的、体格健壮的三百多名工人，组织成专门的运输队，担任危险性物品的装卸工作。这样就防止了事故的发生。
