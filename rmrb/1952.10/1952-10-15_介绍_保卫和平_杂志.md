    Introducing "World Peace" Magazine
    Yang Qiji
    "World Peace" magazine is a publication based on a resolution of the World Peace Council. It was launched in June of last year and is widely circulated around the world in eleven different language versions. The Chinese version has been published up to the fifteenth issue. This magazine is aimed at the broad masses of simple people and specializes in discussing the issue of defending peace that people all over the world are concerned about. It is a truly international forum where people of different beliefs and backgrounds exchange ideas, deepen understanding, and convey the voice of justice and peace. It is also a tool for calling for action, because peace cannot be achieved through empty words; it must be achieved through tireless struggle. Therefore, it mobilizes people all over the world to save peace.
    This magazine is good at grasping issues that have long been on people's minds and uses a lot of space to publish special articles and organize discussions. For example, the inaugural issue was used to discuss the peaceful coexistence of two systems, which is the common wish of countless good people; the second issue focused on the issue of children's education, which could and should be an important factor in peaceful coexistence; the third issue showed readers the new face of Asia; the fifth and sixth issues discussed the adverse effects of the arms expansion policy on the lives of the people of Western Europe; the eighth issue, under the theme of "Miracles Created by Mankind," described the achievements of peaceful labor; the issue of how to improve economic relations between countries has been the subject of discussion for several consecutive issues; the central content of the eleventh issue was the opposition to germ warfare, and Pierre Cot, in an editorial, pointed out to the people of the world that "we are all threatened" and made a powerful indictment of the crimes of U.S. imperialism in carrying out germ warfare; the thirteenth issue recorded the achievements of the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in April this year, which is of great significance to world peace, and predicted that the fruits of peace would be harvested in September and October. The theme of each issue is closely coordinated with the actual struggle on the peace front, pointing out the direction of efforts for the cause of defending peace in each period.
    The progress of internal and international peace movements in various countries is appropriately reflected in this magazine. It publishes articles reporting on the peace movements in various countries: "The People of West Germany Oppose the Establishment of a New Army," "Anti-war Demonstrations in Tokyo," "How the French People Treat the American Occupation Army," "The Right to Defend Peace," "Egypt Launched Silent Resistance," "The Indian People's Views on the Korean War." These reports help everyone understand the face of peace and encourage people with different views to embark on the road of striving for peace together. The world peace movement also leaves its footprint on every issue of this magazine, introducing the resolutions of the World Peace Council's past meetings, the highlights of the Berlin World Youth Festival, the scenes of the Moscow International Economic Conference, the miracle of unity embodied by the Latin American Peace Conference, etc. These articles point out that peace can be saved; as long as we strive for it, the weight of the scales will still tip towards peace.
    Opening this magazine will take you around the world. When you read the article "Projects Built for the Future," the great communist construction projects of the Soviet Union and the lives of its builders will appear before your eyes; the article "The Brilliant Achievements of Economic Construction in New China" records the miracles produced by our ancient and new country in just a few years; "The Project to Rebuild Warsaw" is the crystallization of the creative peaceful labor of the Polish people; "The Cultural Movement in Fighting Vietnam" reports on the achievements of Vietnam in eliminating illiteracy: this series of articles allows you to see happiness and experience the joy of life. "World Peace" magazine also opens the curtain on another world: the article "The Life of the Australian People in the Cold War" allows you to briefly experience the situation of the middle class in Australia; the article "Feelings about Berth Ships at the Atlantic Port" allows you to see the situation of the countries of Franco and Salazar, where poverty and terror rule; and articles such as "Two Faces of Naples" and "With Unemployed Workers in Lancashire" form a striking contrast with the previous series of articles, making us more deeply understand: peace, only peace, can give people a happy life, can allow gray-haired old people to spend a peaceful old age, and can allow young people to enjoy the beautiful spring.
    "World Peace" magazine also contains many valuable articles to help people understand today's world situation and important international issues: Fa Qi's article "Those are All Real" talks about his views on New China and his hatred of the U.S.'s germ warfare; Starlopin's article "Generals, Bankers, Governors and Presidents" provides a detailed and in-depth analysis of the upcoming U.S. elections. In addition, the magazine provides valuable reference materials on the authenticity of the Feteller report exposing Washington's ambitions in the Mediterranean region, the truth about the nationalization of Iranian oil, the status of North Africa in the Atlantic strategy, the importance of the International Economic Conference, and why the arrival of the atomic age has been delayed.
    The published "World Peace" magazine also contains Ehrenburg's "Undersea Torrent," Fast's recent work "Spartacus," Anna Seghers's unpublished novel, Picasso's and Rivera's paintings, and Hikmet's and Neruda's poems and articles. This magazine is truly like a garden where a hundred flowers bloom.
    It should also be mentioned that "World Peace" magazine also has many columns: "Chess," "Sports," "Cooking Methods," "Book Reviews," "Movies" and "Drama," etc. From here, you will know how to play a game of chess, how to make Indian curry chicken; here, world champion Tchetouberk smiles and talks about why he runs so fast; "Miracle in Milan" director Zavattini talks about his plans to shoot a new film. Life is colorful, and the treasures of mankind are infinitely rich, and these are indispensable components of a peaceful life. This magazine tells us how people in various countries live and think: people who love a peaceful life will definitely oppose the imperialist war policy.
    Since its launch, "World Peace" magazine has been warmly welcomed by peace defenders in various countries. French priest Boulier wrote a moving article in the sixth issue of the magazine on the issue of subscription. He said: "I am a subscriber; I support it, I look forward to it, long for it, discuss it every month, this is my magazine." These simple words express the heartfelt voice of all readers who care about the growth of this magazine.
    The Chinese version of "World Peace" magazine is also loved by Chinese readers. The translation of the Chinese version is gradually improving. The editorial department of the Chinese version is planning to expand its content so that each issue can publish some articles about China. This lively and rich magazine is worth introducing to the broad masses of readers.

    介绍“保卫和平”杂志
    杨弃疾
    “保卫和平”杂志是根据世界和平理事会的决议而出版的一个刊物。创刊于去年六月，有十一国不同文字的版本，在全世界各地广泛地流行。中文版已出到第十五期。这个杂志以广大纯朴的人民为对象，专门讨论全世界人民所关心的保卫和平问题。它是一个真正国际性的讲坛，各种信念和出身不同的人们在这儿交流思想，加深了解，传达公理与和平的呼声。它也是一种号召行动的工具，因为和平不能徒托空言，必须通过不倦的斗争才能取得，因此它动员着全世界人民来拯救和平。
    这个杂志善于抓住长系人们心头的问题，用大量篇幅来刊登专稿，组织讨论。譬如：创刊号用来讨论两种制度和平共处的问题，这是无数善良的人们的共同愿望；第二期以儿童教育问题为中心内容，这个问题可能并且应该作为和平共处的一个重要因素；第三期向读者展示了亚洲的新面貌；第五、六期论述扩张军备政策对于西欧人民生活的恶劣影响；第八期在“人类创造的奇迹”这一专题下，描述了和平劳动的业绩；关于如何改进各国经济关系的问题，则是一连好几期的讨论主题；第十一期的中心内容是反对细菌战，皮尔·戈特在社论中向全世界人民指出“我们全都受到威胁”，对美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行提出了有力的控诉；第十三期记录了今年四月间举行的、对世界和平有重大意义的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的成就，预报九、十月间将丰收这和平的果实。每一期的主题，紧密地配合着和平战线上的实际斗争，指出每个时期保卫和平事业的努力方向。
    各国内部和国际间的和平运动进展情况，在这个杂志里都有适当的反映。它刊载了这些报道各国和平运动的文章：“西德人民反对建立新军”，“东京的反战示威游行”，“法国人民怎样对待美国占领军”，“保卫和平的权利”，“埃及发动了沉默的抵抗”，“印度人民对朝鲜战争的看法”。这些报道帮助大家认识和平的面容，鼓励见解不同的人们一齐走上争取和平的道路。世界和平运动也在这杂志的每一期中留下向前迈进的足迹，该刊介绍了世界和平理事会历次会议的决议，柏林世界青年联欢节的花絮，莫斯科国际经济会议的情景，拉丁美洲和平会议所体现的统一奇观，等等，这些文章指出和平可以拯救；只要奋力争取，天秤的重量还是侧向和平。
    打开这份杂志，将使你周游世界。当你读了“为未来而建设的工程”一文的时候，苏联伟大共产主义建设工程及其建设者的生活情况就出现在你的眼前；“新中国经济建设的辉煌成就”一文，记述了我们古老而又新生的国家在短短数年间所产生的奇迹；“重建华沙的工程”是波兰人民创造性的和平劳动的结晶；“战斗越南的文化运动”报道了越南扫除文盲的成绩：这一系列文章使你看见幸福，体会到生之欢乐。“保卫和平”杂志同时也掀开了另一个世界的帷幕：“冷战里的澳大利亚人民的生活”一文，让你在片刻间亲历澳洲中产人家的境遇；“大西洋口岸泊船怀感”一文，让你看到贫困和恐怖统治着的佛朗哥和萨拉查的国家的情景；还有“那不勒斯的两种面貌”、“和兰开郡失业工人在一起”等文，和前一系列的文章形成触目的对比，使我们更深切地体会到：和平，只有和平，才能把幸福的生活给予人民，才能使白发萧萧的老人度着太平的晚年，才能使青年们安享富丽的春光。
    “保卫和平”杂志还载有许多有价值的文章，帮助人们了解今天的世界局势和重要的国际问题：法奇所作“那都是实在的”一文，畅谈了他对新中国的观感和对美国进行细菌战的憎恨；斯达洛平的“将军、银行家、州长和总统”一文，详尽而深刻地分析了美国即将举行的大选。此外，关于暴露华盛顿在地中海区域野心的费泰勒报告书的真伪问题，伊朗石油国有化问题的真相，大西洋战略中的北非地位，国际经济会议的重要性以及为什么延缓了原子时代的到来等问题，该刊都提供了很有价值的参考资料。
    在已出版的“保卫和平”杂志中，还发表了爱伦堡的“海底洪涛”，法斯特的近作“斯巴达克”，安娜·西格斯尚未出版的小说，毕加索和李维拉的画，以及希克梅特和聂鲁达的诗文。这杂志可真像一个百花齐放的园地。
    还应该提到的，“保卫和平”杂志还有许多专栏：“奕棋”、“体育”、“烹调法”、“书评”、“电影”和“戏剧”等等。从这里，你会知道一局棋怎么走，印度加厘鸡怎么做；在这里，世界选手柴笃贝克微笑地谈着他为什么跑得那么快；“米兰的奇迹”导演扎瓦提尼讲他准备摄制一部新的影片。生活是五色缤纷的，人类的财宝是无限丰富的，而这些正是和平生活的不可或缺的组成部分。这个杂志把各国人民如何生活和如何思想告诉我们：爱好和平生活的人们，一定反对帝国主义的战争政策。
    “保卫和平”杂志创刊以来，受到各国和平保卫者的热烈欢迎。法国布利埃神甫曾就订阅问题在该刊第六期写过一篇动人的文章。他说：“我是一个订户；我支持它，我每月期待它、渴望它、讨论它，这是我的杂志。”这几句朴质的话，表达了所有关心这个杂志成长的读者们底心声。
    “保卫和平”杂志的中文版也为中国读者所喜爱。中文版的译文正在逐步改进。中文版编辑部正拟扩充它的内容，使每期都能刊载一部分关于中国的文章。这个生动活泼、内容丰富的杂志，值得向广大的读者们介绍。
