    “Every sensible person sees very clearly: All those who insist that ‘war is inevitable’ are slandering all of humanity.”
    ——“Declaration to the People of the World” of the Second World Peace Congress

    The film "Peace Will Surely Triumph Throughout the World" centrally demonstrates the peace aspirations of hundreds of millions of people around the world, and the unwavering will of hundreds of millions of people around the world to defend peace.

    This is a historical documentary with excellent artistic achievements. It records the convening of the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw. It powerfully demonstrates, with the special function of film, that the growing peace forces in the world are invincible; that the handful of warmongers in front of the peace forces, no matter how frantically they clamor, are insignificant, and peace can be defended. The victory of the Warsaw Peace Congress confirms this for us. The police of Edley who blocked the peace representatives at London Airport, and the gendarmes of Plevin who beat the demonstrators in the streets of Paris, cannot overthrow this truth.

    Ludwik Hager, the editor of this film from the Polish Documentary Film Studio, handled this great historical event with his profound understanding and observation of the world's peace struggle and his skilled artistic techniques. The film begins by describing an autumn in 1950. With great appeal and sharp contrasts, it reveals the tense world situation in the autumn of 1950 and portrays the faces and spiritual lives of two different worlds. In the autumn of 1950, as usual, the American people read with horror and unease in the newspapers used by the big bosses of Wall Street: "Only the atomic bomb is the real guarantee of peace." On this day, Truman strutted proudly on a small island in the Pacific, hanging a bloody "medal" on MacArthur, the murderer who slaughtered the Korean people. Korea was burning, and the flames of war extended to the border of China. American tanks and cannons were transported to French ports. Truman also arrogantly declared while demanding an increase in the military budget: "The United States must be responsible to the whole world." Churchill, the old-fashioned warmonger who first organized the anti-communist crusade thirty-two years ago, and his cronies were also happily designing to use American weapons to arm the lackeys left by Hitler.

    But the destiny of mankind will never be arbitrarily manipulated by this handful of warmongers. On the podium of the United Nations, Vyshinsky solemnly reiterated the Soviet government's peace plan. Democratic Berlin held a large demonstration for peace and the unity of Germany. In France, dockworkers refused to move American-made arms; Italian farmers launched riots and confiscated the land of landlords. To oppose the war, the blood of peace warriors was shed on the streets of Paris, on the streets of Bialoszewski, Milan, and Vienna.

    In this tense struggle, the film loudly tells the world with real and vivid facts: The people have a strong will to defend peace, and they will definitely stop the war.

    The entire film is like a sharp and sarcastic essay.

    The Second World Peace Congress was originally scheduled to be held in Sheffield, the steel center of England. Just as half of the representatives were on their way to England, British Prime Minister Edley stood up and spoke under the direction of his backstage boss: "The British Royal Government is extremely dissatisfied with the peace conference held in Sheffield." He also pretended to say: "Even so, the conference will not be expressly prohibited, because Britain is a free country." The film only used a few shots to describe the "British freedom" that Prime Minister Edley said. That is a well-known product. Even an ordinary Englishman holding a cut-out peace dove would be arrested by Edley's police as a "political suspect."

    With exciting emotions, the film makes us see peace envoys from all over the world changing their original direction within three days and heading to Warsaw. In order to welcome the peace representatives to meet in Warsaw, the people of Warsaw built a building that was originally planned to be completed in eight months in eight days with great enthusiasm. Prague has become the busiest transit station in the world, rapidly transferring peace envoys to Warsaw. At the airport in London, as soon as world-renowned scientists and artists got off the plane, Edley's subordinates shouted "Stop" and were not allowed to stay in "Free Britain." A few days later, when these scientists and artists stepped into Polish territory, even when the train passed through those non-stop small stations, the platforms were crowded with cheering crowds. The Polish people welcomed the peace envoys with the most grand ceremony. The Polish people issued entry visas to reporters from various countries who requested to attend the conference, regardless of whether they represented the arms profits of the Wall Street bosses or spoke on behalf of 10 Downing Street in London.

    The editor of the film, Ludwik Hager, successfully expressed the theme of the film with his high enthusiasm for the cause of peace. From the tense world situation in the autumn of 1950 to the progress of the peace conference, the entire film unfolds vividly in front of us with rich life and political content, so that the audience's emotions are combined with the entire conference from beginning to end.

    At 19:30 on November 16, 1950, the conference opened as scheduled. 1,756 representatives from every corner of the earth, representing the people of 80 countries, gathered in Warsaw to discuss how to stop the war, defend peace, and protect mothers and children.

    When the entire venue warmly cheered Park Jung-ae, the representative of the Korean people, who could not be moved by this touching scene! When Park Jung-ae solemnly and painfully accused the American murderers of the heinous crimes committed in Korea, we directly saw and heard the roar of American planes over Korea from the screen, saw Korean mothers and children being killed, and saw peaceful cities and villages burning. Anyone with a conscience, who can not hate this war of aggression! Every word of Ehrenburg's speech at the conference attracted us: "We are not thinking about our own destiny now. We must take responsibility for all children in light and darkness, for the children of London and Moscow, Paris and Beijing, for the children in New York skyscrapers, and for the children who are currently wandering in the ruins of Korea."

    The film uses concise shots to show the speeches of people representing different races and beliefs. Here are representatives of the Soviet people who are implementing Stalin's plan to transform nature, representatives of the Chinese people who have won a great victory; there are British Conservative Party members, Italian Catholic monks, Greek professors, and German anti-fascist writers. Different languages speak the same wish: "Resolutely support peace and oppose aggressive war." When the entire venue was swept into a wave of cheers to Park Jung-ae, the representative of the Korean people, only an American "representative" named Roach and his wife sat alone, sometimes with their heads down, sometimes looking around like mice. This Mr. Roach was one of the speakers at the conference. When he climbed onto that sacred podium and finished a set of Acheson-style absurdities, the American black representative Howard immediately tore off his mask. The black representative pointed to Mr. Roach and said: "Mr. Roach is a lawyer, but he refused to continue to defend the six black people he handled who were unfairly sentenced. Of course, serving as a legal consultant for the Washington Yugoslav Embassy is more profitable and safer." The representatives of the entire venue expressed a stern contempt for Mr. Roach. There were also some journalists from capitalist countries who had degenerated to such a degree that when some Warsaw children who had lost their parents in the war gathered in front of the conference venue and touchingly shouted "Peace" to the representatives of various countries, they lied there and reported: "The children of Warsaw waited all day long at the entrance of the conference hall, begging for bread." Here, the rumors and slanders of the robbers have no market, and Mr. Roach and these journalists feel lonely. But peace-loving people are closely united and struggle for the happiness of mankind. Victory Square in Warsaw has become a sea of cheering people. Ehrenburg's moving speech touched everyone: "As a representative of the Soviet people who have known all the burdens of war and sincerely hate war, I tightly hold the hands of those people whom our enemies vainly attempt to represent, the hands of Americans, Britons, and Frenchmen. I firmly believe that no force can destroy our tightly clasped hands."

    和平一定在全世界胜利

    “每一个明理的人都看得很清楚：凡是硬说‘战争不可避免’的人，都是在诽谤全人类。”
    ——第二届世界保卫和平大会“告全世界人民的宣言”
    影片“和平一定在全世界胜利”集中地表明了全世界亿万人民的和平愿望，表明了全世界亿万人民保卫和平的坚定不移的意志。
    这是一部具有历史性和有着很好的艺术成就的纪录片，它纪录了第二届世界保卫和平大会在华沙召开的经过。它以电影的特殊功能，富有说服力地显示出：在全世界增长着的和平力量是不可战胜的；在和平力量前面那一小撮战争贩子，不管他们的叫嚣如何疯狂，他们是渺小的，和平是可以保卫的。华沙和平大会的胜利使我们确信这一点。在伦敦飞机场上阻挡和平代表的艾德里的警察，在巴黎街道上殴打游行群众的普利文的宪兵，都不能推翻这一真理。
    波兰文献电影制片厂负责本片的编辑鲁特威克·海格尔，以他对世界和平斗争的深刻理解与观察能力以及熟练的艺术技巧，处理这个伟大的历史事件。影片从描述一九五○年的一个秋天开始，它以极大的感染力和鲜明的对比，揭示着一九五○年秋天时的紧张的世界局势，刻划了两个不同世界的面貌和精神生活。一九五○年的秋天，这一天跟平常一样，美国人民以惊恐和不安的心情，从华尔街大老板们御用的报纸上读到：“只有原子弹才是和平的真正保证。”在这一天，杜鲁门趾高气扬地在太平洋的一个小岛上，为屠杀朝鲜人民的凶手麦克阿瑟挂上血腥的“勋章”。朝鲜在燃烧，战火向中国的边境延伸。美国的坦克大炮运到了法国的港口，杜鲁门在要求增加军事预算时还狂妄地宣布：“美国要向全世界负责。”三十二年前第一个起来组织反共十字军的老牌战争贩子邱吉尔和他的伙计，也正在兴高采烈地设计着用美国武器，去武装希特勒留下的喽啰。
    但人类的命运，是决不会由这一小撮战争贩子去任意摆布的。在联合国的讲台上，维辛斯基庄严地重申苏联政府的和平方案。民主的柏林，在为和平，为德意志的统一而举行大示威。在法国，码头工人拒绝搬运美制的军火；意大利的农民掀起了暴动，没收了地主的田地。为反对战争，和平勇士们的鲜血洒在巴黎的街头上，洒在白罗塞、米兰和维也纳的街头上。
    在这个紧张的斗争中，影片以真实生动的事实，响亮地告诉全世界：人民有保卫和平的坚强意志，他们一定会制止战争。
    整个影片像一篇锐利而辛辣的杂文。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会原定在英国的钢铁中心设菲尔德召开，正当半数的代表在赴英途中，英国的首相艾德里在他的后台老板指使下站出来讲话了：“英国皇家政府为设菲尔德召开的和平大会感到异常的不满。”他还装模作样地说：“即使如此，大会将不被明令禁止，因为英国是个自由的国家。”影片仅用了几个镜头，描写了一下艾德里首相所说的“英国自由”。那是人所共知的货色，甚至是一个普通的英国人拿着一只剪贴的和平鸽子，艾德里的警察都要把它当成“政治嫌疑犯”而逮捕起来。
    影片以令人激动的情绪，使我们看到来自全世界的和平使者，在三天之内改变了原定的方向，向华沙前进。华沙人民为了欢迎和平代表在华沙开会，他们以高度的热情用八天的时间盖好了原订计划八个月才能完成的一所大厦。布拉格成了世界最繁忙的转运站，迅速地转运着和平使者走向华沙。在伦敦的飞机场上，世界闻名的科学家和艺术家刚走下飞机，艾德里的部下就大吼一声“站住”，不许他们在“自由英国”逗留。几天之后，当这些科学家和艺术家们踏入波兰国境，即使火车穿过那些不停的小车站，月台上也是挤满了挥手欢呼的人群。波兰人民用最隆重的仪节，来欢迎和平使者。波兰人民对那些要求参加大会的各国记者，不论他们中间是有代表华尔街老板的军火利润的，还是代表伦敦唐宁街十号官邸讲话的，一概都发给入境签照。
    该片编辑鲁特威克·海格尔以他对和平事业的高度热情，成功地表现了本片的主题。从一九五○年秋天的世界紧张局势到和平会议的进行，整个影片以丰富的生活和政治内容，生动地在我们面前展开，使观众的情绪，自始至终跟整个会议结合在一起。
    一九五○年十一月十六日十九点三十分，大会如期开幕了。一千七百五十六位代表，来自地球的每一个角落，代表着八十个国家的人民集会在华沙，讨论如何制止战争，保卫和平，保卫母亲和孩子。
    当整个会场热烈欢呼朝鲜人民的代表朴正爱时，谁能不为这动人的场面所感动呢！当朴正爱严肃而沉痛地控诉美国杀人犯在朝鲜犯下的滔天罪行时，我们从银幕上直接地看到和听到美国飞机在朝鲜上空的嘶叫，看到朝鲜的母亲和孩子被杀害，看到和平的城市和乡村在燃烧。凡是有良心的人，谁又能不痛恨这种侵略战争呢！爱伦堡在大会发言的每一个字吸引着我们：“我们现在正在想着的不是我们自己的命运。对于在光明与黑暗中的一切儿童，对于伦敦和莫斯科的、巴黎和北京的儿童，对于纽约摩天楼中的儿童，以及对于目前在朝鲜废墟上流浪着的儿童，我们都要负起责任。”
    影片用精炼的镜头，显现了代表各个不同种族、不同信仰的人们的发言。这里有正在执行斯大林改造大自然计划的苏联人民的代表，有获得了伟大的胜利的中国人民的代表；有英国的保守党员，有意大利的天主教修士，有希腊的教授，也有德国的反法西斯作家。不同的语言，说着同一个心愿：“坚决拥护和平，反对侵略战争”。当整个会场卷入向朝鲜人民代表朴正爱的欢呼热潮中，只有一个名叫罗奇的美国“代表”和他的夫人独坐一旁，有时低着头，有时像老鼠一样地左顾右望。这位罗奇先生是大会的发言人之一，当他爬上那座神圣的讲台刚讲完一套艾奇逊式的谰调，美国黑人代表霍华德马上撕破了他的假面具。这位黑人代表指着罗奇先生说：“罗奇先生是个律师，可是他拒绝替他所受理的六个黑人被不公正的判决作继续辩护。当然，作华盛顿南斯拉夫大使馆的法律顾问，收入更多而且安全些。”全场的代表，对罗奇先生表示了一种严峻的蔑视。也有这样一些堕落到如此地步的资本主义国家的记者，当一些在战争中失去了父母的华沙孩子们，群集在大会的会场前，令人感动地向各国的代表高呼“和平”时，他们却昧着良心在那里报道说：“华沙的儿童终日不散地等候在大会门口，哀求面包。”在这里，强盗们的谣言和诽谤没有市场，罗奇先生和这些记者都感到孤独。但爱好和平的人们却紧密地团结在一起，为人类的幸福而斗争。华沙的胜利广场上，成了一片欢呼的人海。爱伦堡动人的发言，感动着每一个人：“作为已经知道战争的全部负担和衷心憎恨战争的苏联人民的一个代表，我紧握着我们的敌人们所妄想代表的那些人们的手，美国人、英国人、和法国人的手，我坚决相信没有任何一种力量能够摧毁我们紧握的手。”
