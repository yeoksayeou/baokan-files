Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 22nd: The Korean Central News Agency reported on the 21st that Pak Hon-yong, Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, cabled the UN Secretary-General on October 17, 1952, attaching a letter from General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, dated October 16, 1952, as well as the full text of the Korean Armistice Agreement draft. He requested that the UN Secretary-General distribute these two documents to the delegations of all UN member states upon receipt. The UN Secretary-General replied to Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong on the afternoon of the 18th, stating that he had not received the letter from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to Clark. Therefore, on the 21st, Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong telegraphed the UN Secretary-General again with the letter from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to Clark. At the same time, he published the telegram he sent to the UN Secretary-General on the 17th, the letter from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to Clark, and the full text of the Korean Armistice Agreement draft. (Xinhua News Agency note: The letter from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to Clark was broadcast by this agency on October 16.)

The text of Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong's telegram to the UN Secretary-General on the 17th is as follows:

To the UN Secretary-General, New York:

I am now sending by telegram the letter from General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, dated October 16, 1952, as well as the full text of the Korean Armistice Agreement draft. After receiving these two documents, please distribute them to the delegations of all UN member states and the members of the UN Security Council so that they may understand the truth of the interruption of the Korean armistice negotiations. I await your reply by telegram.

Pak Hon-yong, Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Pyongyang, October 17, 1952

The full text of the Korean Armistice Agreement draft is as follows: (See pages 1, 2, and 3 of today's newspaper)

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 22nd: The American aggressors are now trying every possible means to block the truth of the Korean armistice negotiations. They even dare not distribute the letter from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to Clark, dated October 16, 1952, and the Korean Armistice Agreement draft, at the United Nations General Assembly, obviously fearing that these two documents will expose the groundlessness of their so-called non-forcible repatriation and completely bankrupt their outrageous lies that they are only adjourning, not sabotaging, the negotiations.

On October 17th, Pak Hon-yong, Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, cabled the UN Secretariat, requesting that the above two documents be "distributed to the delegations of all UN member states and the members of the UN Security Council." However, under the instruction of their American masters, "Wall Street's errand boy" Lie suppressed these two documents. The Associated Press even openly lied, saying that Pak Hon-yong only "requested that the summary of their Korean armistice negotiation proposals and part of the agreement be included in the UN record."

The American aggressors are attempting to use this despicable means to suppress the just voices of the Korean and Chinese sides in order to continue to tightly close the door to negotiations and drive other countries in the United Nations to blindly follow the dangerous expansionist policy of the United States. Their guilty conscience, their suppression and distortion of important documents in the armistice negotiations, fully demonstrates their intention to sabotage the armistice negotiations and expand the war, which makes their empty talk about peace at the United Nations General Assembly even more worthless.

    朝鲜外务相朴宪永两次致电联合国秘书长
    要求分发朝鲜谈判文件
    美国侵略者授意赖伊扣压文件妄图封锁其破坏谈判真相
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】朝鲜中央通讯社二十一日讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永，在一九五二年十月十七日致电联合国秘书长，并随电附去朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在一九五二年十月十六日给联合国军总司令克拉克的信及朝鲜停战协定草案全文，要求联合国秘书长在收到该两项文件后，将其分发给联合国各会员国的代表团。联合国秘书长在十八日下午复电朴宪永外务相，说他没有收到金日成、彭德怀两将军给克拉克的信。因此，朴宪永外务相在二十一日又将金日成、彭德怀两将军给克拉克的信电告联合国秘书长。同时把他在十七日给联合国秘书长的电报和金日成、彭德怀两将军给克拉克的信以及朝鲜停战协定草案全文发表。（新华社注：金日成、彭德怀两将军给克拉克的信，本社已于十月十六日播发。）
    朴宪永外务相十七日给联合国秘书长的电文如下：纽约联合国秘书长：
    我现在将一九五二年十月十六日朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军致联合国军总司令克拉克将军的信及朝鲜停战协定草案全文随电发去，请你在收到这两项文件后，把它们分发给联合国各会员国的代表团及联合国安全理事会的各理事，使他们了解朝鲜停战谈判中断的真相，并望电复。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永一九五二年十月十七日于平壤朝鲜停战协定草案全文如下：（见今日本报一、二、三版）
    【新华社开城二十二日电】美国侵略者现在正在想尽一切办法封锁朝鲜停战谈判的真相，他们甚至不敢将一九五二年十月十六日金日成、彭德怀两将军致克拉克的信和朝鲜停战协定草案在联合国大会上分发，显然害怕这两个文件会揭穿他们的所谓不强迫遣返之毫无根据，并使他们所谓的只是休会，不是破坏谈判的漫天大谎全部破产。
    十月十七日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永致电联合国秘书处，要求将上述两个文件“分发给联合国各会员国的代表团及联合国安全理事会的各理事”。可是在美国主子的授意下，“华尔街的侍从长”赖伊扣压了这两个文件。美联社并且公开撒谎说：朴宪永只“要求将他们的朝鲜停战谈判建议摘要及一部分协议列入联合国记录”。
    美国侵略者企图用这种卑劣的手段来压抑朝中方面的正义的呼声，以便继续紧闭谈判之门，驱使联合国中其他国家盲目地追随美国的危险的扩大侵略政策。他们这种作贼心虚、封锁并曲解停战谈判中的重要文件的行为，充分说明他们存心破坏停战谈判、扩大战争，这使他们在联合国大会上关于和平的空谈更显得一文不值。
