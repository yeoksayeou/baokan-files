    Central South Region Cooperatives Exceed Cotton Purchase Quota in September
    Some Cooperatives Must Overcome Chaotic Phenomena in Cotton Purchase Work
    The cooperatives in the Central South region purchased a total of over 37.6 million jin of new cotton in September, exceeding the original plan. However, some cooperatives have serious chaotic phenomena in their cotton purchasing work, which has caused great dissatisfaction among farmers. This chaotic phenomenon should be quickly overcome.
    The chaotic phenomena in the new cotton purchasing work are primarily manifested in insufficient and improper use of cotton purchasing funds, leading to many areas having to implement purchase limits or stop purchasing altogether. The Jingzhou Special District Cooperative in Hubei Province has a working capital of 13.5 billion yuan. Based on a six-day turnover of funds, it can purchase an average of over 2,800 dan per day, only one-third of the daily market supply (approximately 8,000 dan). This situation is quite common. The Xiachaping Cooperative in Xiantao County, Hubei Province, due to a shortage of funds, stipulates that it will only purchase over 80 dan of cotton per day, and will not purchase cotton from non-members. Cooperatives in Hanchuan, Jingshan, Honghu, Shishou, Zaoyang, and Fancheng in Hubei Province, as well as Shangqiu in Henan Province, and Yuanjiang and Hanshou in Hunan Province, all stopped purchasing for one to four days due to insufficient funds. During the period when the cooperatives stopped purchasing, individual private merchants took the opportunity to lower prices for purchases, causing losses to cotton farmers.
    Some cooperatives' improper use of funds also affects the normal turnover of funds. For example, the Xindi Cooperative in Hubei Province had an average daily inventory of funds five times higher than its average release. The Zhongxiang County Cooperative used cotton purchase funds to purchase sugar, violating the financial discipline of using special funds for special purposes. Many regions' cooperatives have a large backlog of seed cotton, which also ties up funds. The Jingzhou Special District in Hubei Province has a backlog of nearly 3 million jin of seed cotton, equivalent to over 6 billion yuan. The counties of Hanchuan, Jiayu, Xiantao, Jianli, Ouchi and other places in the province each have a backlog of seed cotton ranging from 200,000 jin to 1.5 million jin. The reasons for the backlog of seed cotton in various cooperatives are: first, they do not recognize the losses caused by the backlog of funds, only seeing that they can earn processing fees and cottonseed by processing themselves. Therefore, they are unwilling to organize rural cotton gins for processing. Second, although some cooperatives have concentrated some cotton gins, they have not managed and used them well, failing to realize their due effectiveness.
    In some areas, cooperatives suppress prices, grades, and weights during cotton purchases, and engage in disguised suppression of prices, grades, and weights, causing great dissatisfaction among cotton farmers. This is because some cooperative cadres still have a purely profit-oriented viewpoint and lack experience in cotton grading.
    Many grassroots cooperatives and lower-level institutions of some state-owned cotton yarn and fabric companies have not implemented the statistical reporting system in a timely manner, affecting the ability of higher-level institutions to accurately grasp the purchase of cotton and the use of funds.
    In addition, cooperatives in some cotton-producing areas of the Central South region have not closely integrated material supply work with purchasing work, resulting in insufficient grain supply in places like Taikang and Xiangcheng in Henan Province, and Suixian, Hanchuan, and Honghu in Hubei Province. Farmers in Hanchuan reflected: "Burn incense to sell cotton, kowtow to buy rice."
    The fourth quarter is the season when new cotton is massively available and autumn tax cotton is levied. If the above-mentioned chaotic phenomena cannot be overcome quickly and effectively, it will greatly affect the completion of the cotton purchase task. It is hoped that the party and government leading organs at all levels in the Central South region will solve these problems. (Jin Wu)

    中南区合作社九月份超额完成购棉任务
    部分合作社须克服购棉工作中的混乱现象
    中南全区合作社在九月份共收购新棉三千七百六十余万斤，超过了原订计划。但有些合作社在购棉工作中存在着严重的混乱现象，农民很不满意，这种混乱现象应该迅速加以克服。
    新棉收购工作中的混乱现象，首先表现在购棉资金不足与使用不当，以致许多地区不得不实行限购或停止收购。湖北荆州专区合作社有铺底资金一百三十五亿元，按六天周转一次资金，平均每天可收购二千八百余担，只及每日上市量（约八千担）的三分之一。这种情况相当普遍。湖北仙桃县下查坪合作社因资金短绌，规定每天只收购棉花八十余担，非社员的棉花概不收购。湖北汉川、京山、洪湖、石首、枣阳、樊城，河南商邱，湖南沅江、汉寿等地合作社都因资金不够，曾停购一天至四天。在合作社停购期间，个别私商乘机压价收购，使棉农受到损失。
    有些合作社使用资金不当，也影响了资金的正常周转。例如，湖北新堤合作社九月份每日库存资金高达平均投放数的五倍。钟祥县合作社用购棉资金采购食糖，违反了专款专用的财政纪律。许多地区的合作社积压着大量籽棉，也就积压了资金。湖北荆州专区积压籽棉近三百万斤，折款达六十余亿元。该省汉川、嘉鱼、仙桃、监利、藕池等地各积压籽棉二十万斤到一百五十万斤不等。各地合作社积压籽棉的原因是：一、没有认识积压资金所造成的损失，只看到自己加工可以赚取加工费和棉籽，因此，不愿意组织农村的轧车进行加工。二、部分合作社虽然集中了一些轧花车，但没有很好地管理和使用，不能发挥其应有的效能。
    有些地区的合作社在购棉中压价、压级、压秤和变相压价、压级、压秤，引起棉农极大不满。这是因为部分合作社干部还有单纯营利观点，和缺乏关于棉花验级的经验。
    许多地区的基层合作社和部分国营花纱布公司的下级机构没有及时执行统计表报制度，影响上级机构无法正确掌握收购的棉花和资金使用情况。
    此外，中南部分产棉区的合作社没有把物资供应工作和收购工作密切结合起来，以致河南太康、襄城，湖北随县、汉川、洪湖等地的粮食供不应求。汉川农民反映说：“烧香卖棉，磕头买米”。
    第四季度是新棉大量上市和征收秋征赋棉的季节。上述混乱现象如果不能迅速而有效地加以克服，将大大影响购棉任务的完成，希望中南区各级党政领导机关解决这些问题。　　　（靳吾）
