    "The Article 'Man Conquers Nature' Dispelled My Doubts"
    Comrade Editor: After reading the article "Man Conquers Nature" published in the People's Daily on September 12th, I felt as if I had personally witnessed the agricultural production of Soviet collectivization. Some doubts in my mind were dispelled at once. I had been thinking: "In the future, when agricultural collectivization is implemented, many mountainous areas in our country where 'there are no three miles of flat land,' are far from the river and suffer from droughts every two to three years, truly 'relying on the heavens for food.' How can rural electrification and large-scale water conservancy construction be realized?" Now, after reading this article, I learned that the collective farms in mountainous areas such as the Ardzhenikidze Collective Farm, the Molotov Collective Farm, and the Shusha District of Azerbaijan, "land with slopes less than 45 degrees can be cultivated with machines, and the five-furrow plow used in the mountains will turn over the soil, turning the soil to one side on both the forward and return trips. There is also running water on the mountains, which is pumped up from the foot of the mountains by machines." This proves that as long as highly developed science and technology are widely used, remote mountainous areas also have a promising future. But this can only be achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party, so I am even more determined and confident to fight to the end for the great revolutionary cause of communism.

### “人征服了自然”一文打破了我的疑问

    “人征服了自然”一文打破了我的疑问
    编辑同志：我读了人民日报九月十二日刊登的“人征服了自然”一文以后，仿佛亲眼看到了苏联集体化的农业生产情况，我在思想上的一些疑问，一下就打破了。我原来想着：“将来实行农业集体化，我国不少‘地无三里平’的山区地带，离河又远，三年两头闹旱灾，真是只有‘靠天吃饭’，那能实现农村电气化和大规模的水利建设？”现在读了这篇文章，知道苏联阿尔山尼基则集体农庄、莫洛托夫集体农庄以及阿塞拜疆舒沙区等山地的集体农庄，他们那里“坡度在四十五度以下的地都可以用机器耕作，山地用的五铧犁会翻身，来回都把土翻到一边。山上也有自来水，是用机器把水从山下抽上去的”。由此证明：只要广泛利用高度发达的科学技术，偏僻山区也是有发展前途的。但这必须在共产党的领导下才能做到，因而我更增强了为共产主义的伟大革命事业而奋斗到底的决心和信心。
