He said: "The Chinese people, with their excellent cultural traditions and love of peace, have, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, with the help of the Soviet Union and cultural exchanges and cooperation with various people's democratic countries and peace-loving people all over the world, overcome various difficulties and carried out their own cultural and educational construction work in the past three years. The development speed of new China's cultural and educational undertakings in the past three years has been quite fast."

He said: "Mongolian writers are proud to stand in the same ranks as the literary and artistic workers of our great neighbor, the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, and to fight together for peace. Working to consolidate our friendship is our most important task. Our literary and artistic workers regard expressing close friendship to the great Chinese people as one of the most important themes of literary and artistic creation. For example, writer Damdin Süren wrote poems to congratulate the Chinese people, and Lamusurong's 'Song of Mao Zedong' is now popular throughout Mongolia. Our literary and artistic workers are also actively participating in the work of translating excellent Chinese literary works. The following have now been translated into Mongolian and published: 'The True Story of Ah Q,' 'Diary of a Madman,' 'Kong Yiji,' and 'Changes in Lijiacun.' 'The White-Haired Girl' has been translated into Mongolian and performed during the 'Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Week.' Ding Ling's 'The Sun Shines on the Sangkan River' and Zhou Libo's 'The Hurricane' are about to be published in Mongolian translation. In addition, Mongolian newspapers and magazines publish many works by Chinese poets. The translation of Chinese works has a long tradition in Mongolia. For example, Chinese classical works such as 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms,' 'Water Margin,' and 'Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio' were translated into Mongolian and published a long time ago."

Next, Zhou Libo introduced the general situation of the New China's literary and art movement to the Mongolian writers, and answered the questions raised by the Mongolian writers about the ideological remolding of Chinese literature and art and the training of new writers.

During the meeting, Mongolian writers warmly treated the Chinese Art and Literature Delegation with large bowls of Mongolian mare's milk wine, a famous local product. The cultural workers of the two countries were filled with the internationalist spirit of close unity and mutual learning.
