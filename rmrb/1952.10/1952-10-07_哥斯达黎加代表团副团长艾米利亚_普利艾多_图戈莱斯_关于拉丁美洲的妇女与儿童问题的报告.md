Following the reports made by the Latin American delegations, a vague picture of the lives of women and children throughout the Latin American continent is gradually beginning to reveal a clear and almost common outline.

A large part of our Latin American people are Indians or of mixed race; industry and agriculture are semi-colonial, semi-feudal and backward; as for Latin American women and children, who occupy an even lower position in the system of human exploitation, there are many urgent problems, the solution of which cannot be delayed, and the solution of which is closely linked to the issues of war and peace.

In the last World War, the Latin American people gave great help in the victory of democracy over Hitler's totalitarianism. That victory should have brought peace, and all the benefits of peace, namely: the free and autonomous will of the people, gradual industrialization, elimination of feudalism, promotion of new farming methods in agriculture, promotion of health and hygiene, economic and cultural development of the broad masses of the people: in short, all these were things that the so-called Atlantic Charter allowed to be given to the people of all countries in the world.

But this was just a charming tune. Seven years later, the people of Latin America face a critical situation: all progressive development has come to a standstill. The people are living on the poverty line because wages are frozen while prices are rising without limit. Spending on education, health and public works has been cut, while national war spending has soared; taxes are being increased massively to meet the new needs of rearmament and so-called "continental defense".

Economic and Social Status of Women

First, Latin American women have to endure significant discrimination, which puts them in a lower position than men in terms of work, culture, legal status, and political rights.

Let's look at this first aspect: in some Latin American countries close to the Pacific Ocean, there is social legislation (Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico), but the working women of these countries - those who enjoy the protection of these laws - despite these laws, are still in a worse situation than men. In Chile, women earn 20 percent less than men, and in Mexico and other countries with more progressive legislation, the principle of "equal pay for equal work" is still not implemented.

In general, women cannot fully enjoy social rights, even in countries with progressive social legislation. If this is the case in such countries, what hope can we have for those countries that do not have labor laws or are only just beginning to formulate them?

In this context, some extremely serious problems unique to women arise, such as infant mortality, prostitution, and physical weakness in children, etc., caused by lung disease, malnutrition and venereal disease.

The situation of rural working women is even worse. No Latin American country has social legislation for rural working women, let alone fixed minimum wages and maximum working hours.

In our countries, feudalism is still deeply rooted, and most rural working women, especially indigenous women, are completely ignored and in a miserable state. They do not receive medical care, do not have enough food, and live in very poor conditions; they have almost no opportunities to learn culture, and illiteracy is almost everywhere. All these situations cause them to age prematurely.

We must remember that the greatest wealth of our countries is created by the forces engaged in agricultural production. The Latin American economy is built on agriculture; however, in fact, the proletariat engaged in agriculture suffers the heaviest oppression and exploitation, and even the constitutions of some countries (such as Honduras and El Salvador) do not give them the right to associate.

As far as women's civil rights are concerned, some countries have achieved effective victories. Guatemala has recognized de facto marriage; but other countries, such as Colombia, do not allow divorce. Some constitutions, like Costa Rica's, stipulate the right to investigate paternity.

In some countries with progressive legislation, women have the right to vote and be elected. But even these rights are rendered ineffective by certain shortcomings, which render these rights ineffective and prevent the vast masses of women in the various electoral groups from having the opportunity to express their political opinions.

In general, illiteracy still accounts for a high percentage in Latin American countries, and the majority of them are women.

Children

When discussing the status of children in our countries, let us first talk about the most important thing, namely, the mother problem. In many Latin American countries, there are guarantees for women who are about to give birth. Some countries have prenatal clinics, obstetrical clinics, and hospital services for pregnant women. But this is only available to the urban middle class and working women.

In the countryside, women do not get this kind of security. In many places, such as in Ecuador, women often give birth while working in the fields. In addition, the situation of single women in our countries is very bad. They have no legal protection, and they are more likely to be forced into prostitution than others.

There are not enough nursery schools or day care centers for the children of working women, even in countries where there are indeed such child care facilities. Even worse, many countries have nothing at all. No wonder children who are not cared for easily become criminals, beggars, or vagrants, and they quickly become a serious social problem.

Some countries have passed some laws to protect children - such as laws on the guardianship system, children's courts, children's reformatories, etc.; but, despite this, juvenile crime is growing at an alarming rate.

The difficult economic situation of fathers is a fundamental cause of this social problem, which consumes the most precious reserves that a country can have; its future, the future represented by its children.

Needless to say, all laws relating to this issue are, in truth, unable to solve such a large problem as that of working-class children; and the situation is getting worse as wages fall further. If a child does not commit a crime, he has to work to help his parents, so he begins to be exploited - because the social laws that protect adults do not equally protect children who reach working age. This disadvantage is most serious for children doing agricultural work. Children become victims of a social system that does not give them the right to play, learn, be happy and rest.

As for the education situation, the legislation of all Latin American countries stipulates the establishment of free compulsory education, but in fact, especially children working in the countryside cannot go to school or even have the opportunity to finish primary school.

In the cities, attempts have been made to solve the education problem of child laborers such as shoe-shiners, errand boys, gatekeepers, and peddlers by setting up morning and night schools, but these schools do not solve many problems. In addition, as these facts show, the guarantee of free education does not play a big role. In Costa Rica, there are 162,000 school-age children, of which 57,008 are out of school because there are no schools to attend, and the percentage of out-of-school children is 35 percent. According to the information given by the Chilean delegation, Chile has 346,831 out of 615,000 children each year, with a percentage exceeding 50 percent. Guatemala has 52 percent of children out of school, Honduras has 69 percent of children out of school, and in rural Nicaragua there are virtually no schools for children to read.

Poverty makes parents unable to let their children receive education, although these countries boast of having "free compulsory" education. Juvenile delinquency and excessive working hours are the biggest enemies of children's education, as the Nicaraguan delegation said. In Ecuador, 369,000 out of 711,000 school-age children are out of school - more than half (this is according to the delegation's information). As for Peru, indigenous children get nothing at all, and in El Salvador, out-of-school children account for 59.6 percent (this is also according to the respective delegations' information).

What has caused this situation? Let's look at what the Colombian delegation said, he said: "If we remember that the funds allocated for military purposes in the Colombian budget are in fact 150 million pesos, while the education expenditure is only 30 million pesos, it is easy to infer the state of primary education in Colombia. Due to such a huge difference in the budget, the government has not only not increased schools, but also had to close many schools. This naturally creates a situation in which there are not enough schools in the country, which also explains why the current illiteracy rate is as high as 80 percent." The situation in Colombia is the same as in other Latin American countries, that is, increasing military expenditure under the pretext of so-called "continental defense" and defending "democracy," and reducing the funding for fundamental plans that are truly necessary for people's livelihood - health and public utilities.

Now let us provide some facts to confirm our words.

In Costa Rica, before 1948, education expenditure had always been greater than military expenditure. That means that the number of literate people ranked fourth in the entire continent. Now military expenditure is more, so 35 percent of school-age children do not receive education. Chile spends 17 percent of its financial resources on education, 7.3 percent on public health, and 40 percent on national defense. The illiteracy rate is 25 percent, in Ecuador, the military budget is huge, the education expenditure is very low, and the illiteracy rate is 52 percent. In Honduras, military expenditure is the largest expenditure, while education and health expenditure is very low. The illiteracy rate is 65.4 percent. The preceding materials were all provided by the delegations of the countries concerned.

El Salvador is a typical example, with military spending reaching 36,126,000 pesos, while education spending is only 24,345,000 pesos. Illiteracy reaches 64 percent.

Regarding health issues, we feel that all the following problems are becoming more and more serious: that is, malnutrition, dental disease, tuberculosis, decline caused by excessive drinking, disability or high child mortality - all of which are caused by the same reasons: huge military spending and little health spending; a sharp increase in taxes and a decrease in the purchasing power of wages; and the rise in the price of daily necessities due to discouraging the production of people's basic food (but, on the other hand, encouraging the production of main raw materials for combat, such as in Ecuador, the cultivation of hemp is being vigorously promoted).

Some steps have also been taken to make up for these shortcomings, which are caused by those figures on the continents who are destroying our economy; however, these steps have proven to be insufficient to a very ridiculous extent.

In conclusion: the women and children of all our countries are victims of a situation - all our Latin American delegations agree on this - this situation can only be resolved in an atmosphere of peace, because in an atmosphere of peace, the welfare of the people can truly be taken care of. The people understand this, especially the women - those who feel the consequences of war and preparing for war in their own children. This explains why an exploited and illiterate Ecuadorian Indian woman (her situation was told to us by the Ecuadorian representative), knows that signing for peace is signing for the realization of her basic rights, she pressed her fingerprint under the Stockholm Declaration because she could not write.

We must recognize that not only the possibility of improving the lives of our people is closely related to and depends on the victory of lasting peace, but even the most basic things - poor housing, lack of bread, limited culture, yes, even life itself is threatened by war, as the terrible experience of the Korean people shows, their cities are destroyed, their women and children are sacrificed - even these most basic things depend on the victory of lasting peace.

Women are the creators of life and the natural enemies of war, which spreads death.

Proposals

(1) Establish and strengthen women's organizations to fight for peace.

(2) Strengthen the struggle for women's rights and the action to protect children.

(3) Women's organizations have a responsibility to fight for the development of commercial relations between countries, in order to improve people's living standards and consolidate world peace.

(4) Women's organizations have a responsibility to launch a struggle to demand cuts in military spending and increases in education, public works and health care spending, in order to meet the needs of the people.

Before ending this report, which was hurriedly drafted due to the urgency of time, we would like to extend our fraternal greetings to all the representatives now gathered in Beijing, and assure you of our firm desire to consolidate world peace, and we would also like to express our warm gratitude for the generous hospitality of the glorious Chinese people.

    哥斯达黎加代表团副团长艾米利亚·普利艾多·图戈莱斯
    关于拉丁美洲的妇女与儿童问题的报告
    听了拉丁美洲各代表团所作的报告之后，整个拉丁美洲大陆的妇女与儿童生活的模糊图画，逐渐开始呈现出鲜明而几乎是共同的轮廓。
    我们拉丁美洲的一大部分人民是印第安人或混血人；工业与农业是半殖民地、半封建和落后的；至于在人的剥削制度中处在更低地位的拉丁美洲妇女与儿童，有许多迫切的问题，这些问题的解决是不能被拖延的，这些问题的解决是与战争与和平的问题密切联系着的。
    在上次世界大战里，拉丁美洲人民在民主主义战胜希特勒极权主义方面，曾给予很大的帮助。那个胜利本应带来和平，以及与和平的一切好处，那就是：人民的自由自主的意愿，逐步地工业化，消灭封建制度，提倡农业上的新式耕作方法，保健与卫生事业的推广，广大人民群众的经济与文化的发展：总之，这些都是所谓大西洋宪章允许给予世界各国人民的东西。
    可是这只是一支迷人的调子而已。七年以后，拉丁美洲的人民面临着一个危急的形势：一切进步的发展都已停顿下来了。人民处在贫困线上，因为工资受到冻结而物价却无限制地不停上涨。教育、卫生和公共事业等方面的费用都削减了，而各国的战争费用却在扶摇直上；捐税在大量的增加，以适应重整军备和所谓“大陆防务”的新的需要。
    妇女的经济和社会地位
    首先，拉丁美洲的妇女不得不忍受显著的歧视，这种歧视使她们在工作上、文化上、法律地位和政治权利上，与男子相比，都处在一种较低的地位。
    让我们来看一看这第一方面：在靠近太平洋这一面的有些拉丁美洲国家里，有了社会立法（哥伦比亚、哥斯达黎加、智利、厄瓜多尔、危地马拉和墨西哥），可是这些国家的劳动妇女——那些享受这些法律保护的人——尽管有了这些法律，所处的境遇还是不如男子。在智利，女子所得的工资比男子少百分之二十，在墨西哥和其他有着比较进步的立法的国家里，“同工同酬”的原则也还是没有施行。
    一般说来，妇女不能充分享受社会权利，即使在有进步社会立法的国家里也是如此。如果像这样的国家都是这种情况，那么对于那些没有劳动法规或者仅仅正在开始制订这种法规的国家我们还能抱什么希望呢？
    在这种情况下，一些妇女特有的极端严重的问题产生了，例如婴儿的死亡、卖淫、儿童等由于肺病、营养不良和花柳病所造成的身体衰弱等问题。
    农村劳动妇女的处境还要恶劣得多。任何一个拉丁美洲的国家都没有有关农村劳动妇女的社会立法，更谈不上有固定的最低工资和最高工作日的规定了。
    在我们各国内，封建主义仍然是根深蒂固的，大多数的农村劳动妇女，特别是土著，完全被人忽视，而处在悲惨的状态中。他们得不到医药上的照顾，没有足够的粮食，生活条件非常恶劣；他们几乎完全没有学习文化的机会，文盲几乎到处皆是。所有这些情况使得他们都未老先衰。
    我们必须记住我们这些国家最大的财富是由从事于农业生产的力量所创造的。拉丁美洲的经济是建筑在农业上的；可是，事实上从事农业的无产阶级却受着最沉重的压迫和剥削，甚至于某些国家的宪法（例如洪都拉斯和萨尔瓦多），连结社的权利也不给他们。
    就妇女的民权来说，有些国家已经得到了有效的胜利。危地马拉已经承认了既成事实的结婚；但其他的国家，例如哥伦比亚，却还不允许离婚。有些宪法，就像哥斯达黎加的宪法，规定了查究父系的权利。
    在有着进步立法的一些国家里，妇女是有选举权和被选举权的。但是就连这些权利也由于某些缺点而变为无效了，这些缺点使得这种权利不起作用，不能使各选举团体中的广大妇女群众获得发表政见的机会。
    一般说来，拉丁美洲各国的文盲，仍然占着很高的百分比，而其中大多数是妇女。
    儿童
    在讨论到我们这些国家中儿童的地位的时候，让我们首先谈谈首要的事情，就是，母亲问题。在许多拉丁美洲的国家里，对于就要生孩子的妇女们都有保障。有些国家里对孕妇都有产前诊所、产科诊所和医院的服务设备。可是这只是城市中产阶级和劳动妇女所能得到的。
    在乡村中，妇女得不到这种保障。有很多地方，例如在厄瓜多尔，那边的妇女往往正在田里工作时分娩。此外，我们这些国家里单身妇女的境遇是非常坏的。她们没有法律的保障，她们比其他人更可能被迫去做娼妓。
    对于劳动妇女的孩子们，是没有足够的保育学校或是托儿所的，即使在的确有这种儿童保育设备的国家里也是这样。更糟糕的是，很多国家里根本就什么也没有。无怪那些没有人照管的儿童们很容易变成犯罪者、乞丐或是流浪儿了，他们很快的成了一个严重的社会问题。
    有些国家曾经通过一些保护儿童的法律——例如有关保护人制度、儿童法庭、儿童感化院等法律；但是，尽管如此，儿童的犯罪事件还是惊人地增长着。
    父亲们困难的经济情况，是这个社会问题的一个基本原因，这个社会问题消耗了一个国家所能有的最宝贵的储备；它的未来，它的儿童们所代表的未来。
    一切有关这问题的法律，说实话，都无法用来解决像工人阶级的儿童这么大的一个问题，这是不必多说的；而当工资更下降时，情况就越来越恶化了。如果一个儿童不犯罪的话，他就不得不去做工来帮助他的父母，于是他就开始受人剥削了——因为保障成年人的社会法律并不同样地保障达到工作年龄的小孩子。这个坏处对于做农业工作的儿童们，情形最为严重。儿童成为一种社会制度下的牺牲品，这种社会制度不给他们游戏、学习、幸福与休息的权利。
    至于说到教育情况，所有拉丁美洲的国家的立法中都规定要设立免费的强迫教育，但是事实上，特别是在乡村做工的儿童都不能上学或者连读完小学的机会都没有。
    在城市里，曾经有人企图以设立晨校和夜校的办法来解决童工如擦皮鞋的、当听差的、看门的、当小贩的儿童的教育问题，可是这种学校解决不了多少问题。此外，正如这些事实所表明的，免费教育的保障起不了多大作用。在哥斯达黎加有十六万两千名学龄儿童，其中却有五万七千零八名因为没有学校可上而失学，失学儿童的百分比是百分之三十五。根据智利代表团所给的材料，智利每年在六十一万五千名儿童中有三十四万六千八百三十一名儿童失学，百分比超过了百分之五十。危地马拉有百分之五十二的儿童失学，洪都拉斯有百分之六十九的儿童失学，在尼加拉瓜的农村实际上就没有学校给儿童们读书。
    贫困使父母不能让他们的儿童受教育，虽然这些国家自诩有着“免费的强迫”的教育。儿童犯罪和过多的工时是儿童教育的最大敌人，尼加拉瓜代表团曾这样说过。在厄瓜多尔，七十一万一千学龄儿童中有三十六万九千名失学——超过了一半（这是根据该代表团的材料）。至于在秘鲁，土著儿童一点也得不到什么，而在萨尔瓦多，失学儿童占百分之五十九点六（这也是根据各该代表团的材料）。
    是什么东西造成了这样一种情况的呢？让我们来看看哥伦比亚代表团所说的话，他说：“假如我们记住哥伦比亚预算中拨给军事用途的款项事实上有一亿五千万比索而教育经费只有三千万比索的话，就可以很容易地推知哥伦比亚的小学教育的状况。由于预算相差这样悬殊，政府非但没有增设学校，而且不得不关闭许多学校。这样就自然产生一种情况，那就是国内没有足够的学校，这也说明了为什么在目前文盲比例高达百分之八十。”哥伦比亚的这种情况同样适用于其他拉丁美洲国家，那就是，在所谓“大陆防务”和保卫“民主”的藉口下增加军事费用，减少真正民生所必需的根本大计的经费——卫生和公用事业。
    现在让我们提供一些事实来证实我们的话。
    在哥斯达黎加，在一九四八年以前，教育经费一直比军事经费为多。那意思就是说识字的人数，在整个大陆中占第四位。现在军事经费多了，因此有百分之三十五的学龄儿童受不到教育。智利把百分之十七的财力用在教育上，百分之七点三用在公共卫生上，百分之四十用在国防上。文盲的比率是百分之二十五，在厄瓜多尔，军事预算是庞大的，教育费用很低，文盲的比率是百分之五十二。在洪都拉斯，军事费用是最大的一项支出，而教育和卫生的费用很低。文盲的比率是百分之六十五点四。前面的材料都是由有关各国代表团所提供的。
    萨尔瓦多就是一个典型的例子，军事开支达三千六百一十二万六千比索，而教育费开支只有二千四百三十四万五千比索。文盲达百分之六十四。
    关于健康问题，我们感觉到所有下面这些问题都越来越严重：那就是营养不良、牙疾、肺结核症、因饮酒过度而产生的颓废、残废或儿童的高度死亡率——这一切都是由于同一原因造成的：军费支出浩大而卫生经费很少；税收的急剧增加和工资购买力的减少；以及由于不鼓励生产人民基本食物，日用品价格的上涨（但是，在另一方面，却鼓励生产作战用的主要原料，像在厄瓜多尔，麻的种植正在竭力地提倡着）。
    也曾经采取了某些步骤来弥补这些缺陷，这些缺陷都是摧残我们的经济的那些大陆上的人物所造成的；然而事实证明这些步骤不够到非常可笑的程度。
    总而言之：我们所有国家的妇女和儿童都是一种情况的受害者——我们所有拉丁美洲代表团都同意这一点——这个情况只能在和平的空气中得到解决，因为在和平空气中，人民的福利才真正地能够得到照顾。人民了解这点，特别是妇女——那些在她们亲身儿女身上感到战争与准备战争的后果的妇女。这说明为什么一个被剥削而又不识字的厄瓜多尔的印第安妇女（她的情形是厄瓜多尔代表告诉我们的），知道为争取和平而签名就是为争取她基本权利的实现而签名，她因为不会写字，在斯德哥尔摩宣言下按上了她的指印。
    我们要认识到不仅改善我们人民生活的可能性密切关系着而且有赖于持久和平的胜利，就连最基本的东西——住房不好，缺乏面包，文化受限制，是的，甚至生命本身也受到了战争的威胁，正如朝鲜人民的可怕的经验所说明的，他们的城市被毁灭，他们的妇女与儿童受到牺牲——就连这些最基本的东西也有赖于持久和平的胜利。
    妇女是生命的创造者，是散播死亡的战争的天然的敌人。
    提议
    （一）设立并且加强妇女的组织来为和平而斗争。
    （二）加强争取妇女权利的斗争和保卫儿童的行动。
    （三）妇女组织有责任为发展各国之间的商业关系而展开斗争，以便提高人民的生活水平并巩固世界和平。
    （四）妇女组织有责任展开斗争，要求削减军费，增加教育、公共事业与保健方面的费用，以符合人民的需要。
    在结束这篇由于时间急迫而匆匆起草的报告以前，我们愿意向现在聚集在北京的所有代表们致以兄弟般的敬意，并向各位保证我们巩固世界和平的坚定的愿望，我们还愿意对光荣的中国人民的优厚款待表示热烈的感谢。　（新华社）
