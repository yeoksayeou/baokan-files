Winter clothing for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has been transported from the distant motherland to the Korean front before the weather even turns cold. It has been delivered to the heroic companies guarding the iron-clad "38th Parallel" line and distributed to the Volunteer Army commanders and soldiers stationed throughout Korea.

Even before the winter clothing had been completely shipped out of the garment factories in the motherland, the Volunteer Army's logistics units raised the resounding slogan: "Strive to victoriously complete this year's task of supplying winter clothing!" "Strive to ensure that not a single piece of winter clothing is lost!" Within the logistics units, strict organizations for receiving and transporting winter clothing were established from top to bottom. At that time, the floods in Korea had just passed, and the damaged roads and bridges needed to be repaired urgently. Leaking and collapsing warehouses needed to be tidied up and repaired, and damp supplies needed to be moved and aired... A pile of urgent tasks were simultaneously placed on the shoulders of the Volunteer Army's logistics units. However, thanks to the selfless efforts of the heroic and industrious engineers and station personnel, all preparations for receiving and transporting winter clothing were completed in just ten days. On all railway and highway main and branch lines from the Yalu River to the "38th Parallel," new large bridges were erected; large and small pits were filled; and sturdy fords were prepared at some unbridged crossings. The railway department had long arranged the train schedules to ensure that trains loaded with winter clothing could be transported smoothly and quickly to designated locations. Along the highways, many new gas stations, repair stations, hot water stations, and propaganda and mobilization stations were added. Air defense outposts monitoring enemy aircraft activities were also strengthened. Repair teams were ready at any time to repair roads and bridges, ensuring that the transportation lines were "repaired, restored, and opened to traffic immediately after being bombed." The anti-aircraft artillery units along the transportation lines and near the warehouses wiped their weapons clean and were ready to give the invading enemy planes a fierce blow at any time and place.

Before September, the warehouses for storing winter clothing were also repaired. Stone caves, earthen caves... each warehouse was camouflaged so well and repaired so sturdily. The bottom of the stacks inside the warehouse were raised, and the space was dry and well-ventilated. In order to increase the loading capacity, the truck drivers conducted detailed research and discussions based on the size of the trucks and the packaging of the winter clothing, proposed ways to improve the work, and challenged each other to competitions: load more, drive safely, and ensure that the winter clothing is not damaged.

The statistical staff and storage staff of the station held a series of business research meetings, put forward guarantees of "unload and transport immediately," "unload and store immediately," "do not allow figures to be confused," and "do not allow winter clothing to be damaged," and challenged each other to respond to the challenges.

Mid-September was the late seventh month of the lunar calendar. At night, the earth was pitch black, and one could not see one's fingers. At this time, miracles continued to emerge on the logistics front in Korea.

From the 12th to the 14th of September, in three nights, a certain logistics unit unloaded 141 train cars of winter clothing in separate zones and transported them all to the front lines within six days, delivering them to the companies of each combat unit. A certain station adopted the working method of unloading, distributing, carrying, stacking, and grouping. Eight people unloaded a train car of winter clothing in six minutes; another platoon transported a train car of winter clothing to a warehouse 300 meters away in fifteen minutes. A certain motor vehicle regiment overfulfilled the task of 100,200 ton-kilometers of winter clothing on roads of more than 300 kilometers back and forth in six days, exceeding the original plan by 30 percent. At a certain ferry crossing, 150 cars were ferried across the first night. The second night, they improved the operating method and ferried 250 cars.

At the loading and unloading site, in the pitch-black night, as soon as the train arrived, the heroes of unloading and carrying rushed up. Some carried two large packages on their backs and ran quickly on the road to the warehouse. The shouts of challenge and response, the sound of singing, and the laughter of singing clappers and rhyming couplets were mixed together. On the highway, cars drove into the warehouse area one after another, passing through the dark mountain roads; the flashing lights, seen from a distance, were like millions of torches, shining on the mountainside. Sometimes, as soon as the air defense sentry fired a shot, the millions of torches were immediately extinguished. Silence and darkness awaited the air robbers to head towards death and destruction. Then, the flames of anti-aircraft artillery and anti-aircraft machine guns rose. The enemy plane was shot down and fled. The millions of torches once again shone on the road leading to the front, shining on the road to peace and victory; cars loaded with winter clothing sped forward again.

Seeing the new cotton clothes, the soldiers felt as if they had seen the people of the motherland, whom they missed day and night. The soldiers read the letters of greetings written to them by the workers of the motherland that they took out of their cotton clothing pockets and expressed their determination and put forward plans to thank the great motherland and the beloved people of the motherland for their care and support with practical actions such as eliminating more enemies and striving to be models in training and cultural learning movements. They preserved the cotton clothing very well, ensuring that it would not be damp or damaged, and prepared to wear it to severely strike the invading robbers. The following is a poem written by telegraph operator Wu Renfu that was published on the wall newspaper of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army – "New Cotton Clothes":

New cotton clothes, green face and white lining,
Generous and beautiful,
Thick and soft,
How strong and delicate the sewing.
Feel in the pocket,
Needles, thread, pieces of cloth,
And letters of greetings,
Prepared so thoughtfully.
Cotton clothes!
It's still early autumn,
You came here from the distant motherland,
You can not only keep out the cold,
But also bring us the infinite deep feelings of the people of the motherland.
Thank you!
Great motherland, dear people!
We will wear the cotton clothes you sent,
On the snowy battlefield,
On the bone-chilling transportation line,
In the office caves,
With all our strength,
Severely strike the heinous American aggressors.
Great motherland, dear people!
We will surely win the final victory in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea,
And return to your embrace in the triumphal song of victory.

    冬装胜利到达了朝鲜前线
    杨树生
    天还没有冷，志愿军的冬装，就从遥远的祖国运到了朝鲜前线，送到了守卫在钢铁一样巩固的“三八”线阵地的英雄连队里，发到了分布在朝鲜各地的志愿军指战员手中。
    一
    在冬装还没有完全从祖国的被服工厂运出时，志愿军的后勤部队就提出了响亮的口号：“为胜利完成今年的供应冬装的任务而斗争！”“为保证不损失一件冬装而斗争！”在后勤部队里，从上到下，都建立了接运冬装的严密组织。那时，朝鲜的洪水刚过，被冲坏的公路、桥梁需要抢修，漏水和坍塌的仓库需要整理和修建，受潮的物资需要倒库和晾晒……一大堆紧迫的任务，同时放在志愿军后勤部队的肩头。然而，在英勇勤劳的工兵和兵站工作同志的忘我努力下，仅十天时间，就完成了接运冬装的一切准备工作。从鸭绿江通往“三八”线，所有的铁路、公路干线和支线上，新的大桥架设了起来；大小坑都填平了；某些没有架桥的渡口，也准备好了坚强的漕渡。铁路部门早就编排好了行车计划，使满载冬装的列车，能顺利而迅速地运到指定地点。公路沿线，新增了不少加油站、修理站、开水站和宣传鼓动站。监视敌机活动的防空哨也更加强了。抢修队随时准备着抢修公路桥梁，保证运输线“随炸随修随通车”。在运输线上和仓库附近的高射炮部队，拭擦好了武器，准备随时随地给来犯的敌机以猛烈的打击。
    九月以前，存放冬装的仓库也都修补完竣了。石洞、土洞……每个仓库，都是伪装得那样好，补修得那样结实。库内加高了垛底，又干燥又通风。汽车司机们为了提高装载量，他们根据汽车体积和冬装包装的大小，进行了细密研究和讨论，提出了改进工作的办法，并且互相挑战竞赛：多装，安全行驶，保证冬装不受损失。
    兵站的统计工作人员和保管工作人员，开了一连串的业务研究会议，提出了“随卸随运出”、“随卸随入库”、“不使数字混乱”和“不使冬装遭受损失”的保证，互相挑战应战。
    二
    九月中旬，正是农历七月下旬。夜晚，大地一片漆黑，伸手不见五指。这时，在朝鲜的后勤战线上，奇迹不断地涌现着。
    后勤某部，在九月十二日到十四日的三个夜晚，分区卸下了一百四十一车皮的冬装，并在六天时间内，把它们全部转运到最前线，送到每个战斗部队的连队。某兵站采取卸车、分散、搬运、堆垛分组工作法，八个人以六分钟时间，卸下了一个车皮的冬装；另一个排在十五分钟时间内，将一个车皮的冬装搬运到距离三百米的仓库。汽车某团在往返三百多公里的道上，六天中超额完成了十万零二千多吨公里的冬装任务，超过了原计划百分之三十。某地漕渡口，第一夜渡汽车一百五十台，第二夜，他们改进了操作法，渡过了汽车二百五十台。
    在装卸现场，在漆黑的夜晚，火车一到，卸车、搬运的英雄们立刻就冲上去。有的一人背上两大包，飞快地跑在进库的道路上。挑战应战的喊声，歌唱声，唱快板、顺口溜的欢笑声，混合在一起。在公路上，汽车一辆又一辆地驶入库区，驶过漆黑的山路；一闪一闪的灯光，远看就像千百万支火炬，照耀在半山腰。有时，防空哨的枪声一响，千百万支火炬就立即熄灭了。沉寂和黑暗在等待着空中强盗走向死亡和毁灭。接着，高射炮和高射机枪的火舌伸起了。敌机打落了，逃走了。千百万支火炬又重新照耀着走向前线的大道，照耀着和平胜利的大道；满载着冬装的汽车，又飞驰电掣地前进。
    三
    看见了新棉衣，战士们就好像看见了他们日日夜夜怀念着的祖国人民一样。战士们读着从棉衣口袋里拿出来的祖国工人兄弟们写给他们的慰问信，纷纷表示决心和提出计划，要以消灭更多的敌人、要在练兵和文化学习运动中争取做模范等实际行动来感谢伟大的祖国和亲爱的祖国人民的关怀和支援。他们把棉衣很好地保存着，保证不受潮湿和损失，准备穿着它，狠狠地打击侵略强盗。下面是志愿军某部墙报上登着的报务员吴韧夫写的诗——“新棉衣”：新棉衣、绿面白里，大方又美丽，厚厚的、软软的，缝制得多么结实和精细。摸一摸口袋里，针、线、布片，还有慰问信，预备的这样周密。棉衣呵！还是初秋的季节，你就从遥远的祖国来到了这里，你不仅能御寒，而且给我们带来了祖国人民无限深厚的情意。感谢您呵！伟大的祖国、亲爱的人民！我们将穿着您送来的棉衣，在冰天雪地的战场上，在寒风刺骨的运输线上，在办公的洞子里，用一切力量，狠狠地打击万恶的美国侵略军。伟大的祖国、亲爱的人民！我们一定能取得抗美援朝战争的最后胜利，在胜利的凯歌中，回到您的怀抱里。
