    Canadian Representative Finlay MacKenzie
    Supplementary Report on Economic Exchange
    Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, we have been asked to discuss the issue of economic exchange among the countries of North and South America.
    In the past two years, economic exchange in this region has been dominated by what can be called a war economy, including the development and stockpiling of strategic raw materials, blockades and embargoes, and the large-scale manufacture and transport of munitions and weapons.
    For the sake of convenience, we can divide this entire region into three parts: Latin America, Canada, and the United States. We can see how the war economy affects each part of this region.
    The Latin American countries along the Pacific coast are mainly raw material producers. Chile produces copper, Guatemala produces bananas, and Mexico produces cotton. Almost every country shows the same pattern: one or two basic raw materials are extracted at an extremely rapid rate by foreign companies, while other natural resources are hardly touched at all. There is very little national industry, and agriculture remains at a primitive level. Large industrial working classes and national capitalists have little chance of existing.
    Almost every Latin American country has to rely entirely on one country as its market for raw materials, and that same country supplies the available finished products.
    This unhealthy economic situation makes Latin American countries extremely sensitive to fluctuations in raw material prices; because the market is monopolized by another country, it is difficult for them to find other competitive markets. For example, in 1950, Mexico expanded its cotton planting area to meet the huge need for supplying military uniforms. But in 1951, cotton prices suddenly fell, and Mexico's cotton could not be sold and had to be piled up in warehouses, and the result was misfortune for the Mexican people.
    Since the outbreak of the Korean War, this entire process has been intensified, and there has been a rush to find raw materials, especially war materials. For example, in 1951, the Chilean government agreed to sell 80 percent of Chile's copper production to the United States at a price of 30.5 cents per pound, while the world price at that time was 51.1 cents per pound.
    But increasing the export of raw materials has not increased the wealth of the Latin American working people, but has increased exploitation and made all their economic problems more serious.
    Canada's economic problems share some similarities with those of Latin American countries. It is a supplier of raw materials such as timber, aluminum, and iron. In the past two years, there has also been a rush to find raw materials. Our iron was sold to American monopoly capitalists for one cent per ton, while the refined steel we bought from them cost us eighty dollars per ton.
    The proportion of Canadian exports to the United States in our total exports has recently increased from 37 percent to 59 percent, with the percentage of raw material exports increasing daily.
    But on the other hand, Canada is also an industrialized country, and the current "Cold War" policy is seriously affecting the Canadian industrial working class and industrialists. Industries not engaged in war production are reducing production. The production of clothing, food, housing, forestry products, and other necessities is also decreasing.
    Although the arms industry is booming, it only accounts for a small part of our overall economy.
    As a result of war plans and blockades, Canada has lost several markets, so some of our largest industries are threatened with stagnation. On the Pacific coast of British Columbia, the two largest businesses, fishing and lumber, have lost their former markets in Europe; at the same time, the current blockade prevents them from selling goods on the vast new markets of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the various people's democratic countries.
    The prospects for American foreign trade are also ominous.
    The fundamental reason for this situation is that the American economy has overproduction, and purchasing power cannot keep up. Workers cannot afford the finished products they produce themselves. Products are not selling.
    That is why the United States often wants to export more of its products and import less foreign goods. But no country in the world can only export and not import. So contradictions always exist and become more and more serious.
    Recently, the American government has tried to solve this problem with rearmament and the "Cold War." But this has not solved the problem, but has made it even more serious.
    The "Cold War," blockades, and embargoes have cut off the United States from those markets that could buy most American goods. For example, the People's Republic of China, whose people's living standards are constantly improving, could have provided a huge new market for American goods. But in the past year, according to official American materials, the American government only allowed American merchants to sell a total of $181 in goods to China.
    It is not China that suffers. China's foreign trade volume doubled last year compared to the previous year. However, American merchants are isolated from the world's largest potential market.
    Another aspect of the "Cold War" is the transportation of military supplies rather than useful goods abroad. For example, in the year 1951 to 1952, the United States exported a total of $1.5 billion worth of military equipment and spent more than $1 billion building air force bases on foreign soil.
    But these huge expenses do not increase the purchasing power of American customers abroad. These expenses have neither increased production nor provided employment opportunities. They are a heavy economic burden for the people of the recipient countries, and a serious loss for the American people who have to pay these expenses.
    Finally, this policy of rearmament and re-militarization has aroused strong opposition among people all over the world and has created political turmoil, causing American business people to feel that they can no longer safely invest abroad. Last year, American business people had almost no new foreign investment except in Canada.
    So, who benefits from this militarized economy and the plans for blockades and embargoes? Of course, not the American workers who are threatened by unemployment and the danger of war.
    Of course, not most business people who have lost their largest and most promising markets and are being squeezed out by large monopoly capitalists in the armaments industry.
    The only beneficiaries are a relatively small number of powerful monopoly capitalists, especially those monopoly enterprises capitalists who control the armaments industry. These monopoly capitalists are making huge profits, and they have the ability to force the American government to implement their "Cold War," blockade, and militarization policies. This policy is greatly beneficial to them, but it is leading the rest of the country's people toward depression and is endangering world peace.
    Now, it is clear that this "Cold War" policy of rearmament, blockades, and embargoes cannot solve the economic difficulties of North and South America.
    In Latin America, this policy has aggravated the exploitation suffered by these countries.
    In Canada and the United States, this policy has caused trade imbalances and market losses, thus threatening workers and business people alike.
    The only people who benefit are a very small number of powerful monopoly capitalists engaged in the armaments industry.
    It is often suggested that there are only two choices: either war plans or the biggest depression in history.
    We must make it clear that there is a third choice, which is peaceful and mutually beneficial trade between countries. This trade will greatly help to truly solve the economic problems of North and South America.
    Industries that are now depressed due to the arms race can be fully restarted, and unemployment can be reduced.
    The race to control war materials, which is currently plundering the resources of Canada and Latin American countries, will stop, and these countries can more easily develop balanced economies for the benefit of their people. After economic independence, the foundation for national political independence will be laid.
    We must do everything we can to make the people of the world aware of this third choice. We must do everything we can to realize this policy of peaceful, mutually beneficial trade. If our governments themselves are unwilling to do so, then our people must act independently. Trade agreements between countries can be signed by governments or by people's organizations. Trade conferences, trade fairs, and exhibitions can all be used.
    The International Economic Conference held in Moscow in the first half of this year has shown us a way to break down artificial trade barriers. Many important trade agreements have been signed since the conference.
    Let us make it the beginning of the struggle to break down artificial barriers, which are separating us and threatening our happiness and lives. (Xinhua News Agency)

    加拿大代表芬雷·马肯辑
    关于经济交流的补充报告
    主席先生，各位女士，各位先生，我们被约来谈关于南北美洲国家里的经济交流的问题。
    过去两年中，这个区域里的经济交流一直受着可以称为战争经济的统治，这种经济包括开发和囤积战略原料、封锁和禁运、以及大规模制造和运输军火和武器。
    为方便起见，我们把这整个区域分成三个部分：拉丁美洲、加拿大和美国。我们可以看到战争经济如何影响着这区域中的每一个部分。
    太平洋沿岸的拉丁美洲国家主要都是出产原料的地方，智利出产铜，危地马拉出产香蕉，墨西哥出产棉花。差不多每个国家都表现同样的规律：一两种基本原料被外国公司以极快的速度开采着，而其他的自然资源却几乎一点都没有动。民族工业非常少，农业还停滞在原始的水平上面。大的产业工人阶级和民族资本家很少有存在的可能。
    差不多每一个拉丁美洲的国家都得完全依靠一个国家来作为它原料的市场，本国可用的成品也由这
    一国家来供应。
    这种不健康的经济情况使得拉丁美洲国家对于原料价格的波动极其敏感；由于市场受别国垄断，它们很难找到其他竞争的市场。例如，墨西哥在一九五○年为了供给军士制服的巨大需要，扩大了它的植棉面积。但是一九五一年，棉价突然下跌，墨西哥的棉花卖不出去，不得不堆在仓库里，而结果是墨西哥人民倒楣。
    朝鲜战争爆发以来，这个全部过程更为加强了，有人加紧觅取原料，特别是战争原料。例如，智利政府一九五一年同意把智利矿产中的铜出卖百分之八十给美国，每磅的价格为三角半，而那时的世界价格是每磅五角一厘。
    但是增加原料的出口并没有增加拉丁美洲劳动人民的财富，却是增加了剥削，并使他们所有的经济问题更形严重。
    加拿大的经济问题和拉丁美洲国家有一些问题是相同的。它是木材、铝和铁等原料的供应者。过去两年中，也发生了加紧觅取原料的情形。我们的铁以每吨一分钱的价格卖给了美国垄断资本家，而我们从他们那里所买来的炼过的钢却化了八十块钱一吨的代价。
    加拿大对美国的输出额在我们的总输出额中所占的比例，最近已从百分之三十七增加到百分之五十九，其中原料输出所占百分比日渐增加。
    但是在另一方面，加拿大也是一个工业化的国家，目前的“冷战”政策严重地影响着加拿大的产业工人阶级和工商业家。不从事战争生产的工业都在缩减生产。衣服、食品、房屋、林业产品及其他必需品的生产量也在降低。
    虽然军火工业在蓬勃发展，但是军火工业在我国整个经济中只不过占一小部分。
    战争计划和封锁的结果使加拿大失去了好些市场，因此我们最大的工业有一部分受到了停顿的威胁。在英属哥伦比亚的太平洋沿岸，最大的两种企业，即渔业和木材业，已经失去了过去它们在欧洲的市场；同时，目前的封锁又阻止了它们在中华人民共和国、苏联及各人民民主国家的广大新市场上销货。
    美国的对外贸易的前途也是凶多吉少。
    造成这样情况的基本的原因，是由于美国经济的生产过剩，购买力赶不上。工人们买不起他们自己所生产的成品。生产品滞销。
    正因为如此，美国才经常想多输出它的产品，少输入外国货。但是，世界上没有一个国家能够只输出而不输入。于是矛盾总是存在着，并且越来越严重。
    最近，美国政府曾经企图用重整军备和“冷战”的方法来解决这个问题。但是，这并没有解决问题，反而使问题更加严重。
    “冷战”、封锁、禁运，把美国和那些正是能够买进大部分美国货的市场切断开来。举例来说，人民的生活水准正在不断地提高的中华人民共和国，本可以给美国货提供一个巨大的新市场。但是，在去年一年中，根据美国官方材料，美国政府仅允许美国商人对中国售出总值一百八十一元美金的货物。
    吃亏的并不是中国。中国的对外贸易额，去年比前年增加了一倍。可是，美国的商人却和世界上具有最大潜在力的市场隔离了。
    “冷战”的另一个方面是把军需品而不是有用的物品运输到国外去。举例来说，美国在一九五一到一九五二这一年中共输出价值十五亿元的军事装备，并化了十亿元以上在别国土地上建立空军基地。
    但是，这些浩大的费用并不能增加美国在国外的顾客的购买力。这些费用既没有增加生产，也没有提供就业的机会。它们对于接受国人民在经济上是一个沉重的负担，而对于不得不支付这些费用的美国人民则是一个严重的损失。
    最后，这种重整军备和重新军国主义化的政策在全世界人民中间引起了强烈的反对，并且造成了政治上的动荡，致使美国企业界人士感到他们再也不能很安全地向国外投资了。去年美国企业界人士除了在加拿大外几乎就没有新的国外投资。
    那末，什么人因这种军事化的经济和封锁与禁运的计划而获利呢？当然不是受着失业和战争危险的威胁的美国工人。
    当然不是那些失掉了最大的有发展前途的市场，并且在军备工业方面受到大垄断资本家排挤的大多数企业界人士。
    唯一获利者是比较极少数的有势力的垄断资本家，特别是那些操纵军备工业的垄断企业资本家，这些垄断资本家正在获得巨额利润，他们有能力迫使美国政府执行他们的“冷战”、封锁和军国主义化的政策。这种政策对他们自己大大有利，但是却使国家的其余人民走向不景气，并且正在危害世界和平。
    现在，事实很明显，这种重整军备、封锁及禁运的“冷战”政策并不能解决南北美洲的经济困难。
    在拉丁美洲，这种政策加重了这些国家所受到的剥削。
    在加拿大和美国，这种政策使得贸易失调，市场丧失，因此威胁了工人，而企业界人士也不例外。
    唯一得到好处的人是极少数从事军备工业的有势力的垄断资本家。
    有人时常提出这样一种理论，那便是，只有两种抉择，不是战争计划就是历史上最大一次的不景气。
    我们必须明显指出，有一个第三种抉择，那就是各国之间和平的互利的贸易。这种贸易对真正解决南北美洲的经济问题，大有帮助。
    现在由于军备竞赛而萧条不振的工业可以重新全部开工，失业可以减少。
    目前掠夺加拿大和拉丁美洲国家资源的控制战争原料的竞赛将会停止，这些国家就可以较为从容地发展为他们人民谋福利的平衡经济。经济独立以后，民族在政治上的独立也就打下了基础。
    我们必须尽一切力量使全世界的人民注意到这第三种抉择。我们必须尽一切力量来实现这个和平的、互利的贸易政策。如果我们的政府自己不肯这样做，那我们人民就必须独立行动。各国间的贸易协定可以由政府来签订，也可以由人民组织来签订。贸易会议，贸易博览会和展览会等方式都可采用。
    今年上半年在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议已经给我们指出了一条打破人为贸易壁垒的道路。会后就签订了不少重要的贸易协定。
    让我们使它成为打破人为壁垒的斗争的开端吧，这种壁垒正把我们隔离开来，威胁着我们的幸福和生活呢。（新华社）
