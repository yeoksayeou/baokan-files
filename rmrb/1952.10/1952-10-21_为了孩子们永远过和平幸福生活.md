    For Our Children To Live Peaceful and Happy Lives Forever
    Comrade Editor: After reading the pictorial "Let the Children Live in Peace and Happiness Forever" in your newspaper on September 3rd, I felt truly happy! After reading every photo published in this pictorial, I deeply realized that every smile and every word of these children fully express the happiness, joy, and lofty ideals of the children living in the motherland. At the same time, it further encouraged my strong confidence in opposing war and defending peace.
    After reading this pictorial, I also thought of my own child, Jingling, who is only eleven years old. She is now living a happy life in the warm motherland, just like these children.
    It is for these innocent and lovely children, and for the sake of thousands upon thousands of children in the motherland and the world who can grow up in peace and happiness forever, and no longer suffer the ravages of war, that I am determined to contribute everything, to fight to the end to completely smash the aggressive plots of the warmongers, and not allow the beasts who create war to destroy human tranquility again, so that thousands upon thousands of children will be happy forever.

    为了孩子们永远过和平幸福生活
    编辑同志：我看了九月三日你报“让孩子们永远在和平幸福中生活”的画刊以后，心里真感到高兴！我看完了刊登在这期画刊上的每一张照片以后，深深地体会到这些孩子们的每一个微笑和每一句话，都充分地表露了生活在祖国的孩子们的幸福、欢悦和他们远大的理想，同时更鼓舞了我反对战争，保卫和平的坚强信心。
    看完了这期画刊以后，同时我还联想起我自己的孩子晶玲来，她还只有十一岁，现在也在温暖的祖国过着和这些孩子们一样幸福的生活。
    就是为了这些天真可爱的孩子们，就是为了祖国和全世界千千万万的孩子们能永远在和平幸福中成长，不再遭受战争的摧残，我决心贡献出一切，为彻底粉碎战争贩子们的侵略阴谋而战斗到底，不让制造战争的野兽们再来破坏人类的安宁，让千千万万的孩子们永远幸福。    中国人民志愿军  王瑞仁
