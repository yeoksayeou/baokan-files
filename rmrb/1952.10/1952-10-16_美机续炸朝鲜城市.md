Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 15th. TASS dispatch from Pyongyang, October 15th: The US Air Force continues to barbarously bomb Korean cities and villages, systematically executing Clark’s sinister plan to destroy seventy-eight Korean cities.

    Residential areas in South Pyongan Province, South and North Hamgyong Provinces, Hwanghae Province, and Kangwon Province have all been subjected to frantic bombing by American planes. US planes and warships have been particularly fierce in their attacks on cities on the east coast of Korea such as Wonsan and Hamhung. As a result of the bombing and strafing, the residents have suffered heavy casualties.

    According to reports from correspondents of the Korean Central News Agency, US planes have resumed fierce attacks on Kanggye in North Pyongan Province and nearby villages. It is known that US planes had previously attacked Kanggye fiercely in November and December 1951. On October 9th, US planes once again launched a large-scale attack on this city, which had already been reduced to ruins, marking the second air raid on this city this year. According to reporters, during the air raid on October 9th, sixteen US planes dropped several tons of bombs with tremendous destructive power on the city and strafed it with machine guns. The casualties were mainly women, children, and the elderly. Many houses were destroyed, and a school building was burned down by napalm bombs.

    On the same day, US jets also bombed and strafed other areas of North Pyongan Province.

    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社平壤十五日讯：美国空军继续野蛮地轰炸朝鲜城市和乡村，有计划地执行克拉克的毁灭七十八个朝鲜城市的罪恶计划。
    平安南道、咸镜南北道、黄海道和江原道的居民区都遭到美国飞机的疯狂轰炸。美国飞机和军舰对元山、咸兴等朝鲜东海岸的城市的袭击尤为猛烈。由于轰炸和扫射的结果，居民死伤甚重。
    据朝鲜中央通讯社记者的报道，美国飞机重新猛烈袭击平安北道的江界以及附近村庄。人们知道，在一九五一年十一月和十二月间，美国飞机曾猛烈袭击江界。十月九日，美国飞机又大肆袭击这个已经变成废墟的城市，这是今年第二次对这个城市进行的空袭。据记者报道，在十月九日的空袭中，十六架美国飞机向这个城市投掷了若干吨具有巨大破坏力的炸弹，并用机关枪扫射这个城市。伤亡的居民主要是妇女、儿童和老人。许多房屋被炸毁，一座校舍被凝固汽油弹烧毁。
    在这一天，美国喷气飞机还轰炸和扫射了平安北道的其他地区。
