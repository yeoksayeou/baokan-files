The Chairman of the All Pakistan Peace Committee and the head of the Pakistan delegation, Sharif's speech (abstract)

On behalf of the Pakistan Peace Committee and the peace movement in Pakistan, I congratulate the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. Today, we are very pleased and honored to be able to gather with representatives from various countries in these regions to work together to accomplish a noble cause. The issue of peace cannot be limited by all the differences caused by political opinions, religious beliefs, and national boundaries. Peace is indivisible, and no country can achieve peace alone. Therefore, the cause of peace requires the joint efforts of the people of all countries.

We now firmly defend peace, and if necessary, force acceptance of peace. Therefore, we are determined to replace old hatreds and disputes with friendship and mutual cooperation. Simply hoping for peace cannot achieve peace; in order to fulfill our mission, we must take effective methods and work together to create certain conditions.

The proposals put forward by the representatives of the Chinese people and the calls issued by the preparatory committee are very timely and meet the urgent needs of hundreds of millions of people in Asia. Therefore, they are thanked by peace-loving people all over the world.

This conference is being held at a time when people all over the world are surrounded by instability and fear. People hoped for a solid peace after World War II, but this hope has not been realized. Wars are going on in many countries, and mankind is threatened with complete destruction by another world war, in which all weapons of mass destruction, such as atomic bombs and bacteriological weapons, are likely to be used.

The Korean armistice negotiations do not seem to have yielded any results. The bombing of North Korea and China continues. The scene of destruction and devastation is shameful to all decent people. And it doesn't stop there. They are still trying every possible means to expand the war. Militaristic Japan has been reassured again. Aggressive treaties are being extended to Asia, to the Middle East, North Africa, and the Pacific region. We firmly advocate the right of every nation to self-determination and unequivocally oppose foreign aggression, whether in Korea or Malaya, in China or Vietnam, in Iran or Egypt, in Tunisia or Morocco. The revival of Japanese militarism is a central link in the events of aggression and the problem of war preparations. Imperialist countries are turning these countries into victims in order to achieve their own goals in order to establish war bases in these countries, despite the fact that this is completely contrary to the will of the people, because what the people want is only freedom and peace.

Pakistan is a new country that faces enormous construction tasks; therefore, it needs peace, perhaps more than other places. Before I conclude my speech, I would like to mention an issue that has a special relationship with Pakistan and its closest neighbor, India. The dispute between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue prevents the two Asian countries from establishing friendly relations and brings about a burden of military expenditure that both countries cannot afford, while the United States and Britain have the opportunity to intensify their efforts to obtain privileges from India and Pakistan. We are very concerned that this issue can be resolved peacefully and justly. We are very grateful to this conference for giving the representatives of the peace movements of Pakistan and India the opportunity to discuss this issue.

Finally, I would like to reiterate: our hearts are connected with you. You, representatives from various countries, have gathered here with noble friendship and enthusiasm to solve the problem of how to avoid war and how to ensure peace for this suffering world. The preparatory work for this conference has been very successful, and some delegations have been able to overcome many difficulties to come to Beijing. This gives us confidence that we will surely achieve our goals; believing that if the people of the world are fully awakened, there will be no force in the world that can force them to participate in such a war, a war to ensure that imperialism can safely rule the world.

We assure you all that, God bless us, we will do our best to defend peace. We are confident that we are now standing at the threshold of a new era in Asia, an era that will guarantee peace and freedom to all of us.

Long live world peace!
Long live the freedom of all nations! (Xinhua News Agency)

    全巴基斯坦和平委员会主席、巴基斯坦代表团团长沙里夫的演词
    （摘要）
    我代表巴基斯坦和平委员会与巴基斯坦的和平运动，向亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议致贺。今天，我们感到非常愉快和荣幸，能够和这些地区里各个国家的代表们相聚一堂，他们来到这里是为了共同努力来完成一个崇高的事业的。和平这个问题是政治见解、宗教信仰与国家疆界所造成的一切差别所不能限制的。和平是不可分割的，任何一个国家也不能单独地得到和平，因此，和平事业是需要各国人民共同努力的。
    我们现在坚决保卫和平，假如必要的话，就迫使接受和平。因此，我们决定用友爱和相互间的合作来代替旧有的仇恨和纠纷。单是希望和平还不能取得和平；为了完成我们的使命，我们一定要采取有效的方法，共同工作来创造一定的条件。
    中国人民的代表所提出的建议以及筹备委员会所发出的号召是很合时宜的，并且也符合亚洲几万万人民的迫切需要，因此，他们是得到全世界爱好和平的人民感谢的。
    这个会议，是在全世界的人民被不安定和恐惧所包围的时候召开的。人们希望在二次世界大战后有巩固的和平，但是这个希望并没有实现。在许多国家里，战争正在进行，人类受到了被另一次世界大战完全毁灭的威胁，在这样的大战中，所有大规模杀人的武器，如原子弹和细菌武器都是可能被利用的。
    朝鲜的停战谈判好像没有得到什么结果。对北朝鲜与中国的轰炸还在继续着。破坏与毁灭的景象使
    一切正当的人们都感到可耻。而且还不止于此。他们还在千方百计地想扩大战争。军国主义的日本又得到了保证。侵略性的条约正在扩大到亚洲来，扩大到中东、北非以及太平洋区域来。我们坚决主张每个民族有自决权，毫不含糊地反对外国的侵略，不管是在朝鲜或马来亚，在中国或越南，在伊朗或埃及，在突尼斯或摩洛哥。日本的军国主义的复活乃是侵略事件和备战问题中的一个中心环节。帝国主义国家为了达到它们自己目的而把这些国家变成牺牲品以便在这些国家里面建立战争基地，尽管这完全违反着人民的意志，因为，人民所要的只有自由与和平。
    巴基斯坦是一个新的国家，它面临着巨大的建设任务；因此，它需要和平，也许比其他地方更加需要。在结束我的讲话之前，我要提到一个问题，这个问题对巴基斯坦和它最近的邻国印度有特别的关系。印度和巴基斯坦关于喀什米尔问题的纠纷使这两个亚洲国家不能建立友好的关系，带来了这两国都担负不起的军费负担，而美国和英国就有机会加紧努力从印度和巴基斯坦取得特权。我们非常关心这个问题能得到一个和平公正的解决办法。我们十分感激这次会议给巴基斯坦和印度的和平运动的代表们讨论这个问题的机会。
    最后，我愿意重复说明：我们的心是跟你们连接在一起的。你们来自各国的代表们，由于崇高的友谊热情聚集在这里，一起来解决如何避免战争以及如何保证给这个苦难的世界争得和平的问题。这次会议的筹备工作做得很成功，某些代表团又能克服了重重困难来到北京，这些都给我们一种信心，相信我们一定能达到我们的目的；相信如果全世界人民完全觉醒起来，世界上就没有任何一种力量能够强迫他们去参加这样一个战争，这样一个为了保证帝国主义能够安全地统治世界的战争。
    我们向你们大家保证，愿上帝保佑我们，我们将尽全力来保卫和平。我们肯定地相信，我们现在是站在一个亚洲的新纪元的面前，这个新的纪元将保证给我们全体以和平和自由。
    世界和平万岁！
    各民族自由万岁！（新华社）
