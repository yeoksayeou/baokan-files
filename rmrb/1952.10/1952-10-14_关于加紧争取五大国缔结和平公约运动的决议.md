    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference announces its complete support for the conclusion of a peace pact by the five great powers of the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and France.
    More than six hundred million people have already signed the declaration initiated by the World Peace Council. Among them, the people of Asian and Pacific countries account for several hundred million.
    The settlement of all problems through peaceful negotiation rather than by force is necessary for the vital interests of all peoples. Regardless of the size of our country, whether we live in cities or villages, whatever our profession, whatever the nature of our social system, whatever our political views or religious beliefs, we all need peace.
    The conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact is a major task that all peace-loving humanity must undertake.
    Such a peace pact can stop the wars currently underway and dispel the terrifying shadow of a Third World War from humanity. It can eliminate the terror of germ warfare and atomic bombs. It can relieve the heavy burden of armaments from the backs of the people and remove trade barriers, allowing people to freely exchange the fruits of their labor. It can protect the land and freedom of the people from encroachment by others, open the road to national independence for all peoples, and enable the people of every country to live the life they choose. It can restore the United Nations to its original purpose, making it a place where countries can discuss and reach agreements.
    In an environment of peace, life will be rich and happy; soldiers will return to their homes; children will be safe; mothers will no longer shed tears. Labor and skill, as well as the natural wealth of each country, will be used for the benefit of mankind instead of for destruction. The people of every country will learn to understand and respect the rich culture of their neighbors. Peace is the guarantee of food, clothing, and freedom.
    We call on all the people of the Asian and Pacific regions, and the people of all other countries, to stand together, and with all their strength and love for peace, to make a new and great effort to spread the declaration demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact to every family that has not yet received it, so that the Five-Power Peace Pact can be concluded and the demand for peace can be realized.

    关于加紧争取五大国缔结和平公约运动的决议
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议宣布完全拥护由美国、苏联、中华人民共和国、英国及法国五大国缔结和平公约。
    六亿以上的人民已经在世界和平理事会发起的宣言上签了名。其中，亚洲和太平洋区域国家的人民就占好几亿。
    用和平协商而不用武力来解决所有的问题，对一切人民的切身利益是必要的。不论我们的国家大小，不论我们住在城市或乡村，不论我们从事何种职业，不论我们社会制度的性质如何，不论我们的政治见解或宗教信仰如何，我们全都需要和平。
    缔结五大国和平公约是整个爱好和平的人类必须着手的重大任务。
    这样一个和平公约可以制止目前正在进行的战争，并为人类驱散第三次世界大战可怖的阴影。它可以消除细菌战和原子弹的恐怖。它可以从人民的背上释去军备的重负，并扫除贸易障碍，使人民能够自由地交换他们的劳动果实。它可以使人民的土地和自由不受别人侵犯，为一切人民开辟民族独立的道路，并使每一个国家的人民能够过自己选择的生活。它可以使联合国恢复它原来的宗旨，成为各国商谈和取得协议的地方。
    在和平的环境中，生活将丰富而快乐；兵士们回到自己的家中；儿童们得到安全；母亲们不再流泪。劳动和技能、以及每个国家的自然财富，将用于人类的福利而不用于破坏。每个国家的人民将学会了解并尊重他们邻居的丰富文化。和平就是衣食和自由的保障。
    我们号召一切亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，和一切其他国家的人民站在一起，用他们所有的力量和对于和平的热爱，作一番新的巨大努力，把要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言传到每一个还没有传到的家庭中去，使五大国和平公约得以缔结，和平的要求得以实现。
