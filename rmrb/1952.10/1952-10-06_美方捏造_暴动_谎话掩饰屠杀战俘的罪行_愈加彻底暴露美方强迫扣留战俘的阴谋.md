Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th. As with previous incidents of massacring prisoners of war, the US side is now concocting all kinds of myths to cover up their atrocities of mass slaughtering prisoners of war on October 1st. But the more they try to cover up, the more thoroughly their conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war is exposed.

According to the Associated Press, General Helen, commander of the US Army's Korean Transportation Zone, who is responsible for managing prisoners of war, shamelessly described the October 1st incident of massacring captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who were celebrating National Day, as suppressing "a major riot by Chinese Communist prisoners of war." He also said that in this way they "defeated a large-scale escape plan by 5,884 Chinese Communist prisoners of war detained on Jeju Island." Helen said that the seventh compound of the Three-A prisoner-of-war camp, where the massacre occurred, where the US side detained so-called "cooperative anti-communist Chinese prisoners," that is, our captured personnel who the US side said would "reject repatriation" by collective suicide, was the "hub" of this "riot." But he never explained how he knew this. He also could not explain how, under the strict control of the US side, the prisoners of war isolated in this prisoner-of-war camp could have "agreed on" this "plan." Helen also said pretentiously that the prisoners of war wanted to "go to the mountains and join the guerrillas." Helen's myth was so poorly fabricated that he immediately received two loud slaps in the face from his subordinates. According to United Press, Cardwell, the person in charge of the US prisoner-of-war camp, claimed that "if the Chinese prisoners of war's planned collective riot had succeeded, he did not know what they intended to do"; "He also could not explain how the guerrillas on the island could help them if the prisoners of war escaped."

An October 3rd dispatch from Jeju Island by the Associated Press revealed some of the truth about the October 1st massacre. The dispatch revealed that this massacre was not due to any "prisoner-of-war riot" at all, but a major conspiracy that the US side had planned a month earlier using "informants" illegally present in the prisoner-of-war camp. The Associated Press said that they knew that captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army would commemorate the motherland's National Day on October 1st, "Thus, the date for the second major bloodshed in the Allied prisoner-of-war camp was arranged." On the morning of October 1st, despite the US side's brutal persecution, captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who resolutely demanded repatriation to their motherland, raised the national flag in all compounds of the prisoner-of-war camp, sang songs of their motherland to celebrate National Day, and expressed their loyalty to the motherland. At this time, the massacre immediately began. Although the US side is spreading rumors about prisoners of war also using so-called "weapons made in a few minutes," the Associated Press had to admit that the fact was that American soldiers with "bayonets and rifles" "defeated" the unarmed prisoners of war "hiding behind walls, inside buildings, and in trenches." The fact that the US side opened fire when they first attacked the prisoners of war shows that they had planned what weapons to use long ago. Even United Press said: "We wonder why the American soldiers did not use concussion grenades or tear gas, but instead shot and killed fifty-one prisoners, while the American soldiers only suffered some minor injuries to two soldiers." United Press revealed: "An unnamed officer in the prisoner-of-war camp headquarters said, we had orders to shoot and kill."

Hiding behind the myth of the so-called "major prisoner-of-war riot" of American General Helen is such a brutal and bloody fact of massacring prisoners of war. If Helen's words are further carefully studied, people can also discover another important fact, that is, those who were massacred were precisely the prisoners of war who were called "refusing repatriation" by the US side. As everyone knows, the US side once claimed that there were captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on Jeju Island who requested repatriation and so-called "refused repatriation." In the news about the October 1st massacre disclosed by the US side, the US side has consistently dared not explain whether those who were massacred were prisoners of war who requested repatriation or so-called "refused repatriation." Therefore, people can only draw such a conclusion, that is, those who were massacred on October 1st were Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who were declared by the US side as "refusing repatriation." The reason why they were massacred was because they heroically and unyieldingly expressed their loyalty to the motherland and their firm will to request repatriation to the motherland on the National Day of the great motherland.

This conclusion is made even more certain by the following fact. According to the Associated Press, the US military entered "all compounds on Jeju Island to search" on the 2nd. This fully shows that the prisoners of war called "cooperative anti-communists" by the US side are actually constantly resisting the US side's atrocities of forcibly detaining them. Obviously, if those detained by the US side were really so-called "cooperative anti-communist" prisoners of war, the US side would not need to be in a panic to "search" their compounds frequently.

### 美方捏造“暴动”谎话掩饰屠杀战俘的罪行  愈加彻底暴露美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋

    美方捏造“暴动”谎话掩饰屠杀战俘的罪行
    愈加彻底暴露美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋
    【新华社开城五日电】像对历次屠杀战俘事件一样，美方现在正在编造种种神话来掩饰他们在十月一日大规模屠杀战俘的暴行。但是他们越是掩饰，他们强迫扣留战俘的阴谋也就暴露得越彻底。
    据美联社报道，负责管理战俘的美军朝鲜交通区司令部司令海伦，在二日晚上将十月一日屠杀庆祝国庆的中国人民志愿军被俘人员的事件，无耻地说成是镇压“中国共军战俘的一次大暴动”，并且说，这样他们就“击败了拘留在济州岛上的五千八百八十四名中国共军的大规模逃跑计划”。海伦说，发生大屠杀事件的，美方拘留的所谓“合作反共的中国俘虏”，也就是美方说要以集体自杀来“拒绝遣返”的我方被俘人员的三A战俘营的第七号营场是这场“暴动”的“枢纽”。但是他始终没有说明他是怎样知道这一点的。他也没有能够说明，在美方的严密控制之下，这个战俘营中被隔离的战俘们如何能“商定”这个“计划”。海伦还煞有介事地说，战俘们要“去山中跟游击队合伙”。海伦的这个神话编造得如此拙劣，以致他立刻就挨了他的部下的两记响亮的耳光。据合众社报道说，美方战俘营负责人卡德威声称，“假使中国战俘计划的集体暴动计划成功了，他不知道他们打算干些什么”；“他也不能解释假如战俘逃跑了，这个岛上的游击队如何能帮助他们”。
    美联社济州岛三日消息透露了十月一日屠杀事件的一些真相。消息透露，这次屠杀完全不是由于什么“战俘暴动”，而是美方在一个月之前就已经利用非法地存在于战俘营中的“情报人员”策划好了的大阴谋。美联社说，他们知道中国人民志愿军被俘人员将会在十月一日纪念祖国的国庆，“这样，联军战俘营的第二次大流血的日子就安排好了”。十月一日早晨，不顾美方的残暴迫害、坚决要求遣返祖国的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，在战俘营的所有营场中都升起国旗，唱着祖国的歌来庆祝国庆，并表示他们对祖国的忠诚。这时候，屠杀随即就开始了。尽管美方怎样造谣说战俘们也使用所谓“在几分钟之内造好”的“武器”，但美联社不得不承认，事实是拿着“刺刀和步枪”的美国士兵“打败”了“藏在墙后的、建筑内的、壕沟里的”赤手空拳的战俘。美方在一开始向战俘进攻的时候就开枪射击，这说明他们连使用什么武器都是早就策划好了的。连合众社都说：“我们奇怪美国兵为什么不用击发弹或催泪弹，为什么他们却开枪击毙了五十一名俘虏，而美国兵所受到的攻击仅使两个兵士受到了一些轻伤。”合众社透露：“战俘营司令部里一个不愿透露姓名的军官说，我们有开枪击毙的命令。”
    掩藏在美国将军海伦的所谓“战俘大暴动”的神话后面的，就是这样一个野蛮地屠杀战俘的血腥事实。如果把海伦的话进一步仔细研究一下，人们还可以发现另一个重要的事实，那就是被屠杀的正是被美方称为“拒绝遣返”的战俘。大家知道，美方曾经宣称在济州岛上有要求遣返的和所谓“拒绝遣返”的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。在美方透露出来的有关十月一日大屠杀的消息中，美方始终不敢说明被屠杀的究竟是要求遣返的战俘，还是所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘。因此，人们只能得出这样一个结论，这就是，十月一日被屠杀的是被美方宣称为“拒绝遣返”的中国人民志愿军战俘，他们之所以被屠杀，是为因他们英勇不屈地在伟大祖国的国庆节日表示了他们对祖国的忠诚和要求遣返祖国的坚决意志。
    这个结论，由于下面这个事实而显得更其确实了。据美联社说，美军在二日进入济州岛上的“一切营场进行搜查”。这就充分说明了被美方称为“合作反共”的战俘，实际上经常在反抗美方强迫扣留他们的暴行。很显然，如果被美方扣留的真的是所谓“合作反共”的战俘，美方是用不着慌慌张张地去经常“搜查”他们的营场的。
