To the Editors and to all ethnic compatriots: We are herdsmen from Haten Hoshuo Baga (Village) of Bayanhaada Sumu (District), Chen Barag Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. On the occasion of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, let us say a few words to you. We think you will be happy to hear them.

The residents of this Baga are all Mongolians, living a nomadic life. Since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, we have begun to live as our own masters. Chinbu, the Bagada (village chief), was elected by us. We elected him to lead the people of the entire Baga to handle affairs together. The people's representatives of this Baga, Sederb, Pengbole, etc., were also elected by us. We elected them to attend the People's Representative Conference of the entire Banner to discuss matters related to the entire Banner. We all deeply love our own government and love our Chairman Ulanhu, because he has given us more cattle and sheep, enabled us to wear new clothes, eat rice and wheat flour, and enabled our children to go to school.

Take the four herding households of Huhetaile and Sederb as an example. In the past, they had very few sheep. In 1950, the People's Government lent them 100 sheep each. They voluntarily organized themselves. Some herded cattle and sheep, some cut sheep grass, and some engaged in sideline occupations. By this year, these 400 sheep have increased to more than 760, and this mutual aid group has expanded to eight households. Under their leadership, there are three seasonal mutual aid groups and one long-term mutual aid group in this Baga. With mutual aid groups, things get done much faster. For example, shearing sheep. Before the organization, families with many sheep and few people couldn't shear all the sheep, and the wool of many sheep fell in the wild. This year, the entire Baga sheared 8,000 sheep, and not a single sheep's wool fell in the wild. The Huhetaile mutual aid group built two sheep pens, each holding 600 sheep; a cattle pen that can accommodate more than 150 cattle; and four horse sheds that can accommodate 250 horses. With cattle and sheep pens, we can resist blizzards and reduce livestock losses due to natural disasters.

The Banner People's Government has established a cooperative in Wangong Sumu. The cooperative purchases wool and hides and supplies grain, tea bricks, salt, and daily necessities at fair prices. We are all members of the cooperative. Before liberation, we suffered all kinds of exploitation by Mongolian merchants. They used a few boxes of matches to exchange for a sheep from us. Whenever we recall these things, we feel really uncomfortable. Now that we have cooperatives, we are rarely exploited by merchants.

Let's talk about health work. The People's Government treats us for syphilis and gives us vaccinations. There are very few people with syphilis, and fewer people get sick. Everyone in the Baga now has wooden beds, and no one sleeps on the grass anymore. In summer, mosquito nets are hung in the yurts; bowls, pots, milk buckets, and milk curd basins are all covered with cloth. We wash our clothes every four or five days, and each household uses four or five bars of soap per month. The people in this Baga are very healthy, and many women who had no children have given birth. Take the mother of many children, Aoridengkuo, for example. She has nine children, and she was rewarded at the League Nadam Fair. Before liberation, parents were always worried when a child was born, worrying about how to raise the child to adulthood. Today, those who have many children are rewarded. How can we express our inner gratitude?

There is a reading group in this Baga that subscribes to 25 Mongolian newspapers. We read the newspaper every five days, and the elderly also come to listen. Now most people in the Baga are literate. All children over the age of seven in this Baga are in primary school. Who could afford to study in the past?

Before liberation, we lived in dilapidated yurts, ate allocated sorghum rice, and wore very bad clothes. Some people even turned their leather clothes inside out in the summer. Now the yurts are surrounded by new felt, and everyone sews two or three sets of new clothes every year. We mainly eat beef and mutton, and we often eat rice and wheat flour. At the League and Banner Nadam Fairs, we wear brand new Mongolian clothes, wear bright belts, and wear beautiful headscarves. You can imagine how happy we live.

Everyone knows that we can have such peaceful and happy days today because of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We can only work harder to build our grassland to repay Chairman Mao's kindness.

Compatriots! Today's Inner Mongolia grassland is no longer the grassland of the past. How can we tell you the whole situation in a short letter? If you can come and see for yourselves, we will sincerely welcome you.

    陈巴尔虎旗三个蒙族牧民来信
    报告内蒙古草原上人民的幸福生活
    编辑同志并转全国各族同胞们：我们是内蒙古自治区陈巴尔虎旗白音哈达索木（区）哈腾和硕巴嘎
    （村）的牧民。在中华人民共和国诞生三周年的伟大节日，让我们向你们说几句话，我们想：你们一定会高兴听的。
    本巴嘎的居民全是蒙古人，过的是游牧生活。自从内蒙古自治区成立的那一天起，我们就开始了自己当家作主人的生活：巴嘎达（村长）钦布，是我们选举出来的，我们选出他来，让他领导全巴嘎的人共同办事情。本巴嘎的人民代表色德布、朋波勒等，也是选举出来的，我们选出他们，让他们出席全旗的人民代表会议，商讨有关全旗的事情。我们都非常热爱我们自己的政府，热爱我们的乌兰夫主席，因为他使我们有了更多的牛羊，使我们穿上了新衣，吃上了大米白面，使我们的孩子进了学校。
    就拿胡和泰勒、色德布等四户牧民来说，过去他们的羊很少。一九五零年，人民政府借给他们每户一百只羊，他们自动组织起来，有的放牛羊，有的打羊草，有的搞副业，到了今年，这四百只羊已经增加到七百六十多只，这个互助组已经扩大到八户。在他们带动下，本巴嘎有了三个季节性互助组，一个长期的互助组。有了互助组，做起事来快得多。譬如剪羊毛，在没有组织起来时，羊多的人家，人力少，剪不过来，好多羊的毛都落到野外。今年全巴嘎剪了八千只羊的毛，没有一只羊的毛落到野外。胡和泰勒互助组做了两个羊圈，每个圈装六百只羊；有一座牛圈，能容纳一百五十多头牛；还有四座马棚，能容纳二百五十匹马。有了牛羊圈，可以抵挡暴风雪，减少了牲畜因自然灾害所受的损失。
    旗人民政府在完工索木设了合作社。合作社收购羊毛和皮张，供给粮食、茶砖、食盐和日用品，价钱公道。我们都是合作社的社员。解放前，我们受尽了旅蒙商人的剥削，他们用几盒火柴换我们一只羊，每当我们回想起这些事，心里实在难受。现在有了合作社，很少受商人的剥削了。
    再来谈谈卫生工作。人民政府给我们治疗梅毒，给我们打防疫针，患梅毒的人很少了，得病的人也少了。全巴嘎都有了木床，没有人再睡在草地上。夏天，蒙古包里挂起了蚊帐；碗、锅、牛奶桶、奶干盆都用布盖好。我们每隔四、五天洗一次衣服，每户每月要用四、五块肥皂。本巴嘎的人都很健康，许多没有生育的妇女都生了小孩。拿多子母亲敖日登括来说，她有九个小孩，在盟那达慕会上，她受到了奖励。在解放前，添了孩子，做父母的老是发愁，愁着怎样将小孩抚养成人。今天，生孩子多的却受到了奖励，叫我们怎样来表达内心的感激呢？
    本巴嘎有一个读报组，订了二十五份蒙文报纸。每隔五天读一次报，读报时，老年人也跑来听。现在全巴嘎大多数人都识字了。本巴嘎七岁以上的儿童都进了小学，过去谁又念得起书呢？
    解放前，我们住的是破蒙古包，吃的是配给的高粱米，穿得很坏，有的人到了夏天，将皮衣翻过来穿。现在蒙古包都是围的新毡子，每年每人缝两三套新衣服，我们主要吃牛羊肉，还经常吃大米白面。在盟和旗的那达慕会上，我们穿着崭新的蒙古服，束着鲜艳的腰带，围着漂亮的头巾。你们想：我们过着多么幸福的生活。
    我们能够有今天这样和平幸福的日子，谁都知道是共产党和毛主席给我们的。我们只有更加努力来建设我们的草原，才能报答毛主席的恩情。
    同胞们！今天的内蒙草原已经不是过去的草原了，我们怎能在一封短短的信里告诉你们全部情况呢？如果你们能够亲自来看一看，我们会竭诚欢迎的。乌云　敖得玛　塔力玛
