    Party Building Work in North China

    Currently, the entire North China region is actively carrying out the work of developing the Party. In rural areas, with the exception of a few areas in Pingyuan Province that have begun developing Party members in conjunction with central tasks, all other provinces are actively carrying out preparatory work. In large and medium-sized cities and directly subordinate organizations at the special commissioner level and above, the work of developing Party members has generally begun and has achieved certain results. Beijing developed more than 2,500 new Party members in July and August, Tianjin developed more than 600, Taiyuan developed more than 1,000, and Tangshan developed more than 500. Other cities such as Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Datong, and Anyang have also developed a number of new Party members. In cities such as Beijing and Taiyuan, thanks to the attention of the municipal Party committees, practical plans, sufficient preparation, and adequate strength, and because they were able to correctly grasp the standards for Party members when accepting them and earnestly fulfilled the acceptance procedures stipulated by the Central Committee, the new Party members developed all met the standards for Party members. Generally speaking, Party leading cadres in various parts of North China have attached importance to the work of developing the Party, and some cadres have initially gained experience in developing the Party. All these have laid a favorable foundation for future Party building work.
    According to the existing experience in various places, in order to quickly and effectively implement the instructions of the Central Committee and the North China Bureau on Party building work, leading cadres must pay attention to and master the following issues in the future:
    First, it is necessary to eliminate ideological obstacles in Party building work and specifically organize forces to carry out this work. At present, some leading cadres have not truly understood the important significance of Party building work, and they still one-sidedly emphasize that "there is too much work, too few cadres, and not enough time," while neglecting to personally grasp and specifically organize Party building work; other cadres are afraid of repeating the mistakes of "recruiting at random" that occurred in the past, and do not actively carry out the work of developing Party members; some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the favorable conditions for Party building work after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and therefore lack confidence in completing the Party building tasks stipulated by the Central Committee and the North China Bureau. If these ideological problems are not thoroughly criticized, it will be difficult to smoothly carry out Party building work. Responsible cadres of the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee once made a mobilization report on Party building work to cadres throughout the city and criticized various erroneous ideas that neglected Party building work, thus powerfully promoting Party building work throughout the city. The Beijing Municipal Party Committee organized Party member cadres from the trade union, the Communist Youth League, the public security bureau police stations, the tax bureau, and other systems to separately carry out the work of developing Party members, solving the difficulty of insufficient organizational work force. Facts have proved that wherever this is done, the work of developing the Party has achieved great results. Conversely, ideological obstacles and specific difficulties in the work are not easy to solve, and the results of developing the Party are not great.
    Second, the central link in preparing for Party building is selecting, understanding, and educating activists. In order to systematically grasp the situation of activists, various parts of North China have generally carried out the work of registering activists. The Beijing Municipal Party Committee uniformly stipulated the conditions for activists and instructed various Party organizations to select and register activists according to the conditions. After doing this work, the Party organizations at all levels grasped the basic situation of the activists and had a clear understanding of them. Based on this, they formulated practical and feasible plans for developing the Party. Then, using spare time, they systematically and organizedly adopted methods such as giving large lectures, reading documents, organizing discussions, and conducting individual conversations to carry out education and training for activists. After these efforts, cadres increased their confidence in their work.
    According to the experience in various places, the content of education and training for activists should focus on the standards for Party members. City activists should also be educated to be loyal and honest. After this education, it is possible to carry out the work of understanding and examining them, and basically investigate the historical situation and political experience of the activists. Finally, the activists are ranked, and those who meet the conditions are accepted into the Party; those who do not yet meet the conditions continue to be educated.
    Third, teaching cadres how to correctly grasp the standards for Party members in practical work is an important issue that must be resolved in the current Party building work. Lower-level cadres generally reflect that "the standards for Party members are not easy to grasp." The current situation is mainly that the requirements for those who apply to join the Party are too high. Some require applicants to have creative inventions or special contributions in their work, and do not understand that being able to be active, responsible, and work diligently is one of the conditions for joining the Party. Some hold the view of "only considering class origin," and no longer consider the issue of joining the Party because the applicant's family background is not good. Some mistakenly believe that "clear history" means "clean history"; some reject people who have had certain shortcomings in the past but now meet the conditions for joining the Party. More generally, when examining whether an applicant has met the conditions for joining the Party, they do not mainly examine their own ideological awareness and practical performance in political and work aspects, but only study small problems in their life details. In addition, it is particularly worth noting that there have already been phenomena of rushing for quick results and hastily developing the Party in some areas. For example, after receiving the plan of the Zhangjiakou Municipal Party Committee to develop the Party, the General Branch of the Zhangjiakou United Transportation Company of the CPC did not study and formulate a plan based on the actual situation of the company, but blindly proposed 800 development targets. After the Chahar Provincial Party Committee and the Zhangjiakou Municipal Party Committee sent people to review it, only two of them basically met the conditions for joining the Party. Furthermore, some places do not strictly control the work of developing the Party and do not strictly follow the procedures stipulated by the Central Committee for accepting Party members. Many units in Shijiazhuang did not have introducers when developing new Party members. Even if there were introducers, they did not responsibly introduce the situation of the new Party members to the Party as stipulated by the Central Committee. Or, when developing new Party members, they only discussed and decided by a few branch committee members and reported to the higher-level Party committee for approval. If these biases are not quickly corrected, they will inevitably repeat the mistakes of recruiting at random and lowering the standards for Party members. The above situation shows that it is not enough to only talk about how to correctly grasp the standards for Party members in theory; it is also necessary to teach cadres how to correctly and appropriately grasp the standards for Party members in practical work.
    Fourth, in the formalities for joining the Party, it is necessary to be serious and rigorous, and avoid being overly complicated. In some places now, the formalities for joining the Party are repetitive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, and there is a phenomenon of formalism. This has made the work of developing the Party more difficult. In the past, in Beijing, some branches had to spend 100 hours talking to a development object; it took four hours to discuss and approve a new Party member. In addition to implementing the joining formalities stipulated by the Central Committee, some places have also stipulated a set of joining rituals themselves. Beijing has initially corrected the above shortcomings. Its main experience is: before talking to the development object, the organizer must have a good understanding of the situation of the development object, the purpose of the conversation must be clear, and there must be a center. General conversations not only delay time but also have no practical significance. Before convening a branch general meeting to pass a new Party member, the branch committee must make preparations. At the meeting, the branch committee member will briefly report the situation and conditions of the new Party member in order to help everyone discuss. This saves time and makes it easier to solve problems. As for some Party organizations that believe that activists have been tested through struggle after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, so it is not necessary to carefully and rigorously select, understand, and examine development objects, this is also incorrect. At present, it is necessary for various places to select typical units and typical examples, conduct an in-depth inspection of the procedures for developing the Party, affirm the correct aspects, and criticize the wrong aspects. This is conducive to future Party building work.

### 华北区的建党工作

    华北区的建党工作
    目前，华北全区正在积极进行发展党的工作。在农村，除平原省有个别地区结合中心工作开始发展党员外，各省均正积极进行准备工作。在大、中城市及专署级以上直属机关中，一般已开始了发展党的工作，并已取得一定的成绩。北京市七八月份发展了新党员二千五百多人，天津市发展了六百多人，太原市发展了一千多人，唐山市发展了五百多人，其他如张家口、石家庄、大同、安阳等城市也发展了一批新党员。北京，太原等市由于党委重视，计划切实，准备充分，力量充足，同时由于在接收党员时能够正确地掌握党员标准，并切实履行了中央规定的接收手续，所发展的新党员都符合党员标准。总的说来，华北各地党的领导干部已重视了发展党的工作，并有一部分干部已初步取得了发展党的经验。这些，都为今后的发展党的工作，打下有利的基础。
    根据各地已有的经验，要迅速地切实地贯彻执行中央、华北局关于建党工作的指示，今后领导干部必须注意和掌握以下几个问题：
    第一，要扫除建党工作中的思想障碍，并具体组织力量来进行这一工作。目前有些领导干部尚未真正了解建党工作的重要意义，仍片面地强调“工作多，干部少，忙不过来”，而忽视对建党工作的亲自掌握和具体组织；另有些干部怕重犯过去发生过的拉夫主义的错误，而不积极地进行发展党的工作；有些干部则对“三反”“五反”运动后建党工作的有利条件认识不足，因而对完成中央及华北局所规定的建党任务缺乏信心。这些思想问题如不彻底予以批判，建党工作就很难顺利展开。太原市委负责干部曾为此向全市干部作了有关建党工作的动员报告，并批判了各种忽视建党工作的错误思想，因而有力地推动了全市的建党工作。北京市委把工会、青年团、公安局派出所、税务局等系统的党员干部组织起来，分别作发展党的工作，解决了组织工作力量不足的困难。事实证明，凡是这样作的地方，发展党的工作就获得了很大的成绩。反之，工作中的思想障碍及具体困难便不好解决，发展党的工作的成绩也就不大。
    第二，作好建党准备工作的中心环节是选择、了解和教育积极分子。为了系统地掌握积极分子的情况，华北各地一般均进行了登记积极分子的工作。北京市委统一规定了积极分子的条件，指示各个党的组织按条件选择和登记积极分子。在作了这些工作以后，各级党组织就掌握了积极分子的基本情况，作到了心中有数，据此制订了切实可行的发展党的计划。然后利用业余时间，有计划有组织地采取上大课，看文件，组织讨论和个别谈话等方式，对积极分子进行教育训练工作。经过这些工作后，干部提高了工作信心。
    根据各地经验，对积极分子教育训练的内容应以党员标准为主。对城市积极分子尚须进行忠诚老实的教育。经此教育，就可以进行了解审查工作，把积极分子的历史情况和政治经历基本上考察清楚。最后，将积极分子加以排队，接收已具备条件者入党；尚未具备条件者则继续教育。
    第三，从实际工作中教会干部正确掌握党员标准，是当前建党工作中必须解决的一个重要问题。下层干部普遍反映“党员标准不好掌握”。目前的情况主要是对于入党者的要求偏高，有的要求入党者在工作上有创造发明或有特殊贡献，不懂得在工作中能够积极负责、埋头苦干，就是入党条件之一，有的存在着“唯成分论”的观点，因为要求入党者本人家庭出身不好，就不再考虑其入党问题；有的将“历史清楚”误认为“历史清白”；有的将历史上虽曾有某些缺点但现已具备入党条件的人也拒绝于“门外”。更为普遍的是在考察一个申请入党者是否已具备入党条件时，不是主要地考察其本人的思想觉悟和政治、工作各方面的实际表现，而只是研究其生活细节上的小问题。另外，值得特别注意的是，目前已有一些地区发生了急于求成，仓促发展党的现象。例如中共张家口市联运公司总支委员会在接到中共张家口市委发展党的计划后，没有根据本公司的实际情况进行研究，制订计划，即盲目地提出了八百名发展对象。经中共察哈尔省委、张家口市委派人审查后，其中基本上够入党条件者只有两人。再就是有的地方对发展党的工作控制不严，没有严格按照中央所规定的手续接收党员。石家庄市有不少单位在发展新党员时就没有介绍人。即是有介绍人，也未按照中央所规定的，由介绍人负责地向党介绍新党员的情况。或者发展新党员时，只经少数支部委员讨论决定，报上级党委批准。这些偏向如不迅予纠正，必将重复拉夫凑数、降低党员条件的错误。上述情况说明，只从道理上讲如何正确掌握党员标准是不够的，还必须在实际工作中教会干部正确而又恰当地掌握党员标准。
    第四，在入党手续上，既要作到认真、严肃，又要避免过分繁琐。现在有些地方，在履行入党手续上，内容重复，费时费力，有形式主义现象。这就使发展党的工作发生了更多的困难。北京市过去有的支部和一个发展对象谈话，就得一百小时的时间；讨论通过一个新党员时，就得四个小时的时间。还有的地方除执行中央规定的入党手续外，自己又规定了一套入党仪式。上述缺点北京已初步予以纠正。其主要经验是：在和发展对象谈话之前，组织员必须很好地了解发展对象的情况，谈话的目的要明确，要有中心。泛泛的谈话，不但拖延时间，且无实际意义。在召开支部大会通过新党员前，支委会要作好准备工作，会上由支部委员简明扼要地报告新党员的情况、条件，以便帮助大家讨论。这样既节省时间，又容易解决问题。至于有些党的组织认为经过“三反”、“五反”运动，积极分子已经过斗争考验，因而不必再认真、严肃地选择、了解和审查发展对象，这也是不对的。目前各地均有必要选择典型单位和典型事例，对发展党的手续，作一次深入的检查，肯定正确的方面，批判错误的方面。这是有利于今后的建党工作的。
