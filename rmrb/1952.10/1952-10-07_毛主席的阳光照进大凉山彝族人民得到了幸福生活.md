Chairman Mao's Sunshine Illuminates the Yi People of the Liangshan Mountains, Bringing Them a Happy Life

To the Editor: National Day is here. I don't know how to express my excitement. People who have gained happiness after enduring long-term suffering have a love for the motherland that cannot be expressed in words.

I am a young man of the Yi ethnicity from the Liangshan Mountains in Xikang. From the day I was born, I lived a miserable life. We wore tattered hemp cloth, slept under sheepskins, and lay on wild grass; often we couldn't eat salt for months, and at most we could eat two meals of rice a year. The Kuomintang reactionaries' policy of Great Han chauvinism not only provoked mutual killings between the Han and Yi peoples, but also provoked infighting within our own ethnic group. The Kuomintang army, like wolves, demanded grain and money, plundering and raping whenever they ascended the Liangshan Mountains. At that time, the Yi people suffered so much and shed so many tears!

We are liberated! Chairman Mao's sunshine shone into the Liangshan Mountains, driving away the cold and darkness, and we have turned over. We have gained true freedom and equality, and our religious beliefs and customs are respected. This year, my hometown has established an autonomous region, and we are masters of our own affairs. The People's Government has established many primary schools in the autonomous region, giving children the opportunity to study; it has also sent our young people to various ethnic minority institutes or training classes. My hometown has also established trade companies that supply everything, especially salt and rice, which have been transported in large quantities, solving the long-term material difficulties of the people of the Liangshan Mountains. Ethnic relations have undergone fundamental changes. Not only are we internally united, but there is no longer any enmity between the Han and Yi peoples. Everyone is truly close at first sight, respects each other, and unites like brothers and sisters around the Communist Party, building our big family. These things make me deeply feel the greatness and correctness of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy.

I had never read books before, nor had I been to a big city; the Liangshan Mountains were the world I had seen. After liberation, the People's Government transferred me to Xichang to study, and last year I was transferred to the Central University for Nationalities in Beijing. The school takes good care of our lives and is very concerned about our thoughts and studies. I can now write ordinary articles. Thinking of the happy life of our Yi people now, I often shed tears of excitement. I am determined to study harder in the future to repay the kindness of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

    毛主席的阳光照进大凉山彝族人民得到了幸福生活
    编辑同志：国庆节到了。我不知怎样来表达我兴奋的心情。经过长期苦难而得到幸福的人，对祖国的热爱是没法用话说出来的。
    我是一个彝族青年，家在西康大凉山。我从出生那天起，就过着悲惨的生活。穿的是乱麻布，盖的是羊皮，垫的是野草；常常几个月吃不上盐，一年最多能吃到两餐大米饭。国民党反动派的大汉族主义政策，不但挑拨汉彝两族人民互相仇杀，还挑拨我们本民族内部自相残杀。国民党的军队像狼子一样，一上大凉山，就是要粮要款，抢掠奸淫。当时我们彝族人民不知受了多少苦，流了多少泪啊！
    解放了！毛主席的阳光照进了大凉山，赶走了寒冷和黑暗，我们翻身了。我们得到了真正的自由平等，我们的宗教信仰、风俗习惯受到了尊重。今年，我的家乡又成立了自治区，自己当家作主了。人民政府在自治区内设立了许多小学，使儿童有了念书的机会；又把我们青年们，送到各民族学院或训练班学习。我的家乡还设立了贸易公司，什么东西都供应，特别是盐巴、大米运来很多，解决了大凉山人民过去长期的物质困难。民族关系已经起了根本的变化，不但我们内部团结一致了，在汉彝两族之间，也再不打冤家了。大家真是一见就亲，互相尊重，像兄弟一样团结在共产党的周围，建设我们的大家庭。这些，使我深深感到毛主席民族政策的伟大和正确。
    我过去没读过书，也没到过大城市；大凉山就是我所见到的世界。解放后，人民政府调我到西昌学习，去年又把我调到北京中央民族学院学习。学校对我们的生活照顾得很周到，对我们的思想和学习
    也十分关心。我现在已经能写普通的文章了。想到我们彝族人民现在的幸福生活，我常常兴奋得流出眼泪来。我决心今后更加努力学习，来回答毛主席和共产党的恩情。
