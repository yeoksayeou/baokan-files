Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 13th: On October 6th, Korean-Chinese People's troops captured eight enemy hilltop positions in the vicinity of Kimhwa on the central front in one fell swoop.

	At 7:30 p.m. that evening, a crack assault force of our army bravely stormed a ridge east of Yuldong southeast of Kimhwa, wiping out an entire enemy company, four platoons, and a battalion command post. The next day, in a continuous battle repelling thirteen enemy counterattacks, our troops killed or wounded over 300 enemy soldiers. This hilltop is shaped like a chair, and the soldiers call it "Chair Mountain." During the "Autumn Offensive" launched by Van Fleet last year, the enemy lost thousands of soldiers trying to seize this ridge. This time, when the enemy troops in the area were attacked, although their planes circled in the sky to provide support, using strings of flares to illuminate the ridge as if it were daytime, they still could not save themselves from being wiped out. Simultaneously with the capture of this ridge, our troops also captured seven other enemy hilltop positions near Kimhwa, namely: Namsan south of Jwaseo-dong, the northeast highland of Gyoyamsan, Seosan west of Gwanam-ri, another highland east of Yuldong, Shangjia Mountain's northwest mountain, the northeast mountain of Height 381, and Namsan south of Height 399.8. In the battles to capture these seven hilltops, our troops annihilated seven entire enemy platoons and most of four platoons. The next day, our troops repelled continuous enemy counterattacks on most of the hilltops, eliminating over 250 enemy soldiers on the northeast highland of Gyoyamsan alone.

	In this counterattack in the vicinity of Kimhwa, our troops annihilated one entire enemy company, eleven entire platoons, most of four platoons, and one battalion command post, and including the results of repelling enemy counterattacks, eliminated a total of over 1,400 enemy soldiers.

    朝中部队一举攻克敌军八个山头
    在这次反击战中共歼敌一千四百余人
    【新华社朝鲜前线十三日电】十月六日，朝中人民部队在中线金城附近地区一举攻克敌军的八个山头阵地。
    这天晚上七点半钟，我军一支精干的突击部队勇猛攻上金城东南栗洞以东的一座山岭，将守敌一个连、四个排和一个营的指挥所全部歼灭。第二天，我军在连续打垮敌人十三次反扑的战斗中，又杀伤敌军三百多名。这个山头形如座椅，战士们称它为“椅子山”。去年范佛里特发动“秋季攻势”时，敌军为了侵占这个山岭，曾丧失了数千名士兵的性命。这次该地敌军受到打击的时候，虽然有他们的飞机在天空中盘旋支援，用一串串的照明弹把山岭照得如同白昼，但仍然不能挽救他们被歼的命运。与攻占这座山岭同时，我军并攻占了金城附近另外七个敌军山头阵地，即座首洞南山、轿岩山东北高地、官岩里西山、栗洞以东另一个高地、上佳山西北山、三八一高地东北山、三九九点八高地南山。在攻占这七个山头的战斗中，我军共歼灭敌军七个排的全部及四个排的大部。第二天我军又在大部分山头上打退了敌军的连续反扑，仅在轿岩山东北高地上，即歼敌二百五十多名。
    在这次金城附近地区的反击战中，我军共歼灭敌军一个整连、十一个整排、四个排的大部及一个营指挥所，连同击退敌军反扑的战果在内，共计歼灭敌军一千四百余人。
