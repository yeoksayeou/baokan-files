    A Free Marriage of a Young Uyghur Couple
    Ge Li
    One early spring evening this year, the sun had already set, and the afterglow of the sunset reddened the snow on the top of the Tianshan Mountains, radiating a golden and brilliant light. Mariyam, the director of the Women's Federation of Hainuke Anusitan Township in Ningxi County, Yili Prefecture, Xinjiang, excitedly rode her horse, galloping across the vast grassland. She wanted to rush to the fields that night to tell Muhemati—her newlywed husband!—the news that she had been transferred to the prefecture to study land reform policies. Muhemati was the director of the village farmers' association and the head of the village security team. He took more care in handling matters for the masses than he did for his own affairs. Therefore, he was supported by the masses and was also elected as the leader of the production mutual aid team. He and Mariyam were both active participants in the rent reduction and anti-hegemony struggle. Their wedding ceremony was held at the Hainuke celebration rally for the victory of rent reduction and anti-hegemony.

    Muhemati and Mariyam's homes were originally next door neighbors, separated by only one wall. Both of their parents worked hard for the landlords, selling their labor to make a living. They grew up together playing with woolly eggs and hitting *bishik* [Note], tending sheep and ducks for the landlord, and attending elementary school together for two years. From then on, love took root in their hearts.

    When Muhemati was sixteen, he went to work as a long-term laborer for the landlord. At this time, Mariyam was already a fourteen-year-old girl. According to the old customs of the Uyghur people, she was old enough to marry. Although she was young, she was skilled at embroidery. Who wouldn't want to marry such a beautiful and skillful wife! Her mother, Rozihan, strictly controlled her daughter according to the old rules, worrying about choosing a son-in-law all day long.

    Mariyam was as anxious as if she were being fried in oil, day and night hoping that Muhemati would come back and make a decision. Finally, during the Corban Festival, the two met. She told Muhemati about her mother arranging marriages for her and asked him to think of a solution. She worriedly said, "You go out to work for several months and don't come back. I live every day in fear..." Muhemati comforted her and said, "I'll have Dad ask the imam to propose marriage tomorrow."

    Muhemati's father, Romaji, followed the old custom and used the little savings he had accumulated from a lifetime of hard work to prepare clothes and betrothal gifts, and asked the respected imam in the township to propose marriage for his son.

    Mariyam's father, Ramahong, had long thought that Muhemati was a smart, capable, and hardworking boy. He and Romaji had been old confidants who had worked hard for the landlord together for half their lives, so he was very willing to make this match. However, Rozihan disliked Muhemati's family for being poor and said coldly, "Humph! If I wanted to find someone like him, I wouldn't have waited until now!" Ramahong knew that his wife was stubborn and couldn't be persuaded with a few words, so he said to the matchmaker, "This is a thrifty family that can live a good life. The children have grown up together since they were young and know each other's temperament..." Rozihan angrily interrupted before the old man finished speaking, "Can live a good life, but so poor that they don't even have a felt rug? My daughter can't go to his house to suffer!" She gave the old man and the matchmaker a big disappointment. The marriage proposal was thus put on hold.

    From then on, arguments frequently occurred in Ramahong's family. Rozihan arranged marriage proposals for her daughter everywhere, wanting to find a wealthy family, while the old man Ramahong, who had worked hard for the landlord for half his life, hated the rich and powerful the most, so he strongly disagreed. Mariyam was even more dissatisfied with her mother's arranged marriage and often argued about it. Thus, although four or five landlords sent betrothal gifts, the marriage was never settled.

    In early 1950, staff members of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government came to Yili. Some landlords were afraid and stopped hiring long-term laborers, partnering with farmers to cultivate the land. Muhemati changed from a long-term laborer to a partner (tenant farmer). Although he was still exploited by the landlord, he was much more free than when he was a long-term laborer. He thought to himself, "The Han people's party (at that time, he didn't know it was the Communist Party) benefits the poor as soon as they arrive. This must be a fair and good party." So he brought this important matter back and told Mariyam. Mariyam excitedly grabbed Muhemati's hand and said, "This Han people's party will definitely come to our Hainuke!" Muhemati continued, "We don't need to worry about our affairs anymore."

    In November 1951, the rent reduction and anti-hegemony work team led by the Chinese Communist Party arrived in Hainuke. Muhemati and Mariyam enthusiastically participated in the work. They motivated many young farmers and women to participate. They organized study groups, and Muhemati was elected as the study group leader. While helping the cadres with their work, they organized young people to study, and they didn't bother to think about their own affairs.

    After the anti-hegemony struggle, Muhemati and Mariyam honorably joined the New Democratic Youth League. Mariyam was the first activist among the women of Hainuke Anusitan Township. The masses supported her for her enthusiasm and conscientiousness in handling affairs, and elected her as the director of the township Women's Federation. In order to handle affairs for everyone, she left early and returned late, and didn't think about her own affairs anymore.

    Muhemati became even more active in his work after joining the League, and everyone in Hainuke praised him. On the day the village farmers' association director was elected, Mariyam's mother, Rozihan, threw all three of her corn kernels into Muhemati's bowl. The old man Ramahong smiled and said from the side, "What do you think? I saw it right, didn't I?" Rozihan said a little embarrassed, "In the past, I only thought that the poor were born to suffer. Who would have thought that they would be able to stand up?" The village chief Tursun walked over with a smile and said, "The marriage of your two families should also be arranged."

    Muhemati and Mariyam decided to hold a new-style wedding ceremony at the Hainuke celebration rally for the victory of rent reduction and anti-hegemony.

    Romaji borrowed a large cart and loaded two pockets of the fruits of rent reduction, wanting to rush to the city overnight to sell them and prepare betrothal gifts. As soon as Romaji drove the cart out, he ran into Muhemati. Muhemati grabbed the horse's reins with one hand and asked in surprise, "What are you doing?" Before the old man could speak, his mother ran over from behind the cart and said, "You pretend you don't know? We're preparing for your wedding!" Muhemati said anxiously, "Ah! Are you still going to follow the old rules? What does it say in our patriotic agreement? The cadres are promoting production and economy every day, and economizing production. Haven't you heard!" The father and son argued for a long time, but the old man still insisted on going. He said, "What else can we do? There's nothing in the house. When relatives and guests come, what will we use to entertain them? Besides, can we go to marry someone empty-handed?" Muhemati said somewhat angrily, "The government calls on us to use the fruits of struggle for production, not to waste them. Now weddings can't be like they were in the past. The Marriage Law stipulates that no betrothal gifts are allowed. If we waste the grain for nothing, what will we use for production in the spring?" These words left the old man speechless, so he had to pull the cart back.

    Mariyam's family was also preparing for the wedding. Ramahong felt that the days were too short and couldn't think of what to prepare for a while. Rozihan was busy borrowing this from one family and that from another, clamoring to make naan and squeeze milk to prepare food for the guests. At this time, Romaji asked someone to send the betrothal gifts. When Rozihan saw that the package was so small, without a cart and without red wrapping, she felt a little unhappy. After the gift-giver left, she opened the package and saw that there was only a piece of floral cloth and a pair of boots. She angrily threw the gift out the door and scolded, "You really don't appreciate favors. How can there be such a cheap thing in the world!" Saying that, she began to cry. Ramahong also felt uncomfortable on his face. He muttered to himself, "This! This is too outrageous! I've never seen such a way of marrying a wife in all my years!"

    The old couple Romaji also felt very sorry and prepared to send two more sheep, but were stopped by Muhemati. They were really unhappy in their hearts.

    On the wedding day, two hours before the wedding ceremony, the club was already packed with people. The railings, windowsills, and beams were all full of people, and there were still many people outside the club who couldn't squeeze in. Muhemati and Mariyam, wearing dazzling red flowers on their chests, held the first new-style wedding ceremony in Hainuke's history.

    The old couple Ramahong, wearing big red flowers, sat on the stage. Seeing such a grand and lively wedding ceremony, they also changed their old minds. The old man stroked his gray beard and kept smiling. Rozihan stood up and said excitedly, "I have never been so happy in my whole life. Let the children handle their own affairs, and we can't stick to those old rules!"

    一对维吾尔族青年男女的自由结婚
    歌黎
    今年初春的一个傍晚，太阳已经落山，晚霞映红了天山顶上的积雪，放射出金色灿烂的光芒。新疆伊犁专区宁西县海奴克阿奴斯坦乡妇联主任玛丽亚木，兴奋地骑着马飞似地奔驰在广阔的草原上。她想连夜赶到地里去，告诉木合买提—她的新婚丈夫！她被调到专区学习土地改革政策的消息。木合买提是村农会主任兼村治安组组长，给群众办事比办自己的事还经意，因此得到群众的拥护，又被选为生产互助组组长。他和玛丽亚木都是减租反霸斗争中的积极分子，两人的结婚典礼就是在海奴克庆祝减租反霸的胜利大会上举行的。
    木合买提和玛丽亚木的家原是只隔一堵墙的近邻，两人的父母都是给地主扛活下苦、卖劳动力过生活的。他俩从小就在一起抛毛蛋、打比石〔注〕，一同给地主放羊看鸭子，一同上过两年小学。从那时起，爱情就在两个人的心里扎上了根。
    木合买提十六岁那年给地主去当长工。这时玛丽亚木已是十四岁的姑娘了。按照维吾尔民族的老习惯，早到了结婚的年龄。她年纪虽小，却能刺会绣。谁不想娶上这样一个人俊手巧的媳妇呢！妈妈若孜汗，按照老规矩把女儿严管起来，整天为挑女婿的事操着心。
    玛丽亚木心焦得像油煎，昼夜盼望木合买提回来定个主意。好容易盼到肉孜节，两人才见了面。她把妈妈为她说亲的事告诉给木合买提，要他想个主意。她担心地说：“你一出去做工就是几个月不回来，我每天提心吊胆地过日子……”木合买提安慰她说：“我让爸爸明天就请阿訇去说亲。”
    木合买提的爸爸若玛吉，照着老习惯把半辈子下苦攒的一点积蓄，置办了衣物彩礼，请了乡里的大阿訇去给儿子说亲。
    玛丽亚木的父亲拉麻洪早就看中木合买提是个聪明能干、爱劳动的好孩子。他和若玛吉又是半辈子一同给地主下苦的老知心，所以很愿意结这门亲。可是若孜汗却嫌木合买提家穷，冷冷地说：“哼！要找他这样人家，还要等到这时候！”拉麻洪知道老婆固执，三言两语说不转，就对媒人说：“这倒是一家勤俭能过日子的人家，孩子们从小都在一块儿长大，互相摸得着脾气……。”若孜汗没等老汉说完，就气愤愤地打断话头说：“能过日子，还穷得连个毡子都没有？我的姑娘不能到他家去受罪！”给了老汉和媒人一个大没趣。这件亲事就这样搁了下来。
    从这以后，拉麻洪的家庭经常发生争吵。若孜汗到处给女儿说亲事，想找个有钱的人家，老汉拉麻洪给地主下苦半辈子，最恨有钱有势的人，所以死不同意。玛丽亚木更不满意母亲包办她的婚事，时常为此争吵。这样，虽然有四、五家地主送来了聘礼，亲事却始终没有说成。
    一九五○年初，中国共产党和人民政府的工作人员来到伊犁。有些地主害了怕，不雇长工了，把土地和农民伙种。木合买提从长工变为伙伴（佃户），虽然仍受地主剥削，但比当长工自由多了。他心想：“汉人的党（那时还不知道是共产党）一来，就对穷人有好处，这一定是个公道的好党。”于是把这件大事带回来，也说给了玛丽亚木。玛丽亚木兴奋地拉住木合买提的手说：“这个汉人的党，一定会到咱们海奴克来的！”木合买提接着说：“咱们的事也不用再愁了。”
    一九五一年十一月，中国共产党领导的减租反霸工作队到了海奴克。木合买提和玛丽亚木兴奋、热情地参加了工作。他俩带动很多青年农民、妇女参加了工作。他们组织了学习组，木合买提被选为学习组长。一面帮助干部工作，一面组织青年学习，自己的事就没顾得再往心上放。
    反霸斗争后，木合买提和玛丽亚木光荣地加入了新民主主义青年团。玛丽亚木是海奴克阿奴斯坦乡妇女中第一个积极分子。群众拥护她办事热心、认真，选她做乡妇联主任。她为给大家办事，早出晚回，对自己的事也没再想。
    木合买提入团以后工作更积极了，海奴克没有一个人不夸奖他。选村农会主任那天，玛丽亚木的妈妈若孜汗把三粒苞谷籽全投在木合买提碗里。老汉拉麻洪在一旁笑着说：“怎么样，我看得不错吧！？”若孜汗有点不好意思地说：“过去我只当穷人是天生受苦的，谁还想到会翻了身？”村长吐尔逊笑着走过来说：“你们两家这亲事也该办了。”
    木合买提和玛丽亚木决定在海奴克庆祝减租反霸的胜利大会上举行新式结婚典礼。
    若玛吉借了一辆大车，把减了租的果实装了两口袋，想连夜赶到城里去卖了，置办彩礼。若玛吉赶着车一出门就碰上了木合买提。木合买提一手扯住马缰，惊奇地问：“这是干什么？”老汉还没开口，妈妈从车后跑过来说：“你装不知道，给你办喜事呀！”木合买提着急地说：“啊呀！你们还要照老规矩办？咱们订的爱国公约上写的什么？干部们天天宣传生产节约，节约生产，你们就没有听见！”父子俩争辩了半天，老汉还坚持要去，他说：“不去怎么办？房子里要什么没什么，亲戚客人们来了，拿什么招待？再说，空着两手去娶人吗？”木合买提有些生气地说：“政府号召把斗争果实用在生产上，不要浪费。现在结婚不能像过去，婚姻法上规定不许索取任何彩礼。咱们白白把粮食糟蹋了，春天用什么生产？”这几句话说得老汉无言答对，只好把车拉回去。
    玛丽亚木家也正在准备办喜事。拉麻洪觉得日子太短促，一时想不起来该准备些什么。若孜汗却忙着东家借这西家借那，吵喊着打馕挤奶子，准备客人吃的东西。这时若玛吉请人送来彩礼。若孜汗一看包儿那么小，也没用车，也没包红，心里就有些不高兴。送礼的人走后，她打开包儿一看，原来只有一件花布衣料和一双靴子。她气得一手把礼物扔出门外，骂着说：“真是不识抬举，世上那有这样便宜的事情！”说着就哭起来。拉麻洪的脸上也热剌剌地感到不舒服。他自言自语说：“这！这太不像话了！我活了这么大岁数就没见过这样娶媳妇的！”
    若玛吉老俩口心里也很过意不去，准备再送两只羊去，但被木合买提挡住了，心里着实不高兴。
    结婚这天，离举行婚礼还差两个钟头，俱乐部里就挤满了人。栏杆上、窗台上、房梁上到处都坐满了人，俱乐部外面还有很多人没挤进去。木合买提和玛丽亚木胸前带着耀眼的大红花，举行了海奴克历史上的第一个新式结婚典礼。
    拉麻洪老俩口带着大红花坐在台上，看见这样隆重热闹的结婚典礼，也把老脑筋转过来了。老汉用手摸着灰白的胡子，不断微笑着。若孜汗站起来激动地说：“我活了一辈子，从来也没有今天这样高兴。孩子们的事情，还是让孩子们自己去办，可不能固执那种老规程！”
    〔注〕比石：是羊的骨节骨，维吾尔族小孩多玩此游戏。
