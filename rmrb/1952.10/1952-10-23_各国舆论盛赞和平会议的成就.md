Countries' Opinion Highly Praises the Achievements of the Peace Conference
[This newspaper dispatch] Comprehensive news: The great achievements of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and the conference's declarations and resolutions, have been praised by opinion circles in various countries.
    The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" published in its international commentary column on the 18th, an article by Vronsky commenting on the achievements of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, pointing out: "The Peace Conference indicated that the broad world peace movement has entered another important stage, it will become a source of strength and inspiration in the struggle for the victory of world peace. This conference will help strengthen and expand the peace movement, and will become a powerful factor in preparing for the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna in December."
    Korean opinion circles and people of all classes warmly support the various resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Newspapers such as "Nodong Sinmun," "Minju Choson," and "朝鲜民报" all published editorials, warmly praising the great achievements of the conference. "Nodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 15th entitled "The Consistent Call of 1.6 Billion People for a Peaceful Solution to the Korean Question" saying: The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference took the Korean question as one of the most important topics for discussion, and the representatives and special representatives of various countries unanimously demanded the immediate realization of an armistice in Korea on a fair and reasonable basis, and called on the people of the world to further unite and fight for world peace and security. The editorial pointed out that the Korean people actively support the demands and calls of the representatives, hoping that the Korean question will be peacefully resolved. "Minju Choson" published an editorial on the 15th entitled "The People of the World Unite to Defend Peace" pointing out: The people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific Regions will not but pay attention to the tasks and facts pointed out in the documents adopted by the Peace Conference, because they know that the flames of the war of aggression waged by US imperialism in Korea today, and the haze of armed Japan, may become disasters falling on their heads tomorrow. If the imperialist wars of aggression in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya and other places are not stopped today, and if the re-militarization of Japan is not stopped, then the struggle of the weak nations in the Asian and Pacific regions for freedom and independence will be difficult to achieve the final goal. Therefore, those who strive for the freedom and independence of their motherland and love peace must closely combine their own national liberation struggle with the struggle against new wars.
    Public opinion in European People's Democracies attaches great importance to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.
    Berlin's democratic newspapers all published the "Appeal to the People of the World" and the "Letter to the United Nations" from the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in prominent positions. "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial on the 15th entitled "The Asian People Are Rising Up Against the American Aggressors" saying: "There is no doubt that the Beijing Peace Conference marks the peak of the common struggle of the Asian peoples for peace and national independence." And said: "The Beijing Peace Conference proves that the American monopoly capitalists can no longer restore their already disintegrating imperialist front in the Far East." The editorial then said: "The importance of the Beijing Peace Conference is particularly obvious to us Germans. The American war preparations of aggression in the West and its aggression against Korea, Vietnam and Malaya can obviously be seen as going hand in hand. The two military agreements concluded by the United States in Bonn and Paris are also obviously parallel to the war treaty between the United States and the Yoshida government of Japan. Therefore, every achievement of the Asian people is a valuable help to our struggle for national unity and peace." The Czechoslovak Communist Party organ "Rude Pravo" published a commentary on the 19th entitled "The Voice of Peace of Two-Thirds of Humanity" pointing out: The discussions at the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference powerfully demonstrated the growing strength of the world peace movement and the unbreakable unity of the powerful anti-war democratic front. The discussions at the conference showed the inseparable relationship and lasting friendship between peace defenders from all countries and the Soviet Union. The commentary said: The establishment of the People's Republic of China dealt a huge blow to world imperialism, and the Beijing Peace Conference emphasized the growing determination of the people of all countries to defeat the war plans of US imperialism. The worldwide movement of people from all countries to defend peace has received new and powerful support from the Beijing Conference; the results of the conference will enable the defense of the peace movement to mobilize the entire peace and democratic camp on a larger scale to actively prepare for the World People's Peace Congress. The conference of peace fighters from various countries in Asia and the Pacific made the final victory in the struggle to prevent another world war closer.
    Public opinion in Western European countries is also paying close attention to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.
    The London "Daily Worker" published the "Appeal to the People of the World" and the "Letter to the United Nations" adopted at the closing session of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in prominent positions on the 14th, as well as news that Beijing citizens held a grand mass meeting in the Taihe Hall in Beijing to celebrate the closing of this historic conference, and published an editorial entitled "The Voice of Asia." The editorial wrote: When 1.6 billion people raise their voices and demand an end to the Korean War, the world must pay attention. This is the unanimous voice of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference at the close of its Beijing meeting. The editorial also emphasized: "The British people support the demand for the withdrawal of troops from Malaya."

    各国舆论盛赞和平会议的成就
    【本报讯】综合消息：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的巨大成就，和会议的宣言与决议，受到各国舆论界的赞扬。
    苏联消息报十八日在国际评论栏中发表佛隆斯基评论亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成就的论文指出：“和平会议指明了广泛的世界和平运动已进入另一个重要阶段，它将成为争取世界和平胜利的斗争中的力量与鼓舞的泉源。这个会议将有助于加强和扩展和平运动，而且将成为定于十二月在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会的筹备工作的一个有力因素。”
    朝鲜舆论界和各阶层人民热烈拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各项决议。“劳动新闻”、“民主朝鲜”、“朝鲜民报”等报都发表社论，热烈赞扬会议的巨大成就。“劳动新闻”十五日发表题为“十六亿人民争取和平解决朝鲜问题的一致呼声”的社论说：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议把朝鲜问题作为最重要的议题之一来讨论，各国的代表和特邀代表一致要求在公平合理的基础上立即实现朝鲜停战，并号召全世界人民进一步团结起来，为全世界的和平与安全而奋斗。社论指出朝鲜人民积极支持代表们的要求和号召，希望朝鲜问题获得和平解决。“民主朝鲜”十五日以“全世界人民一致奋起保卫和平”为题发表社论指出：亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民都将不能不注意和平会议通过的文件中所指出的任务和事实，因为他们知道，美帝国主义今天在朝鲜进行的侵略战争的火焰，和武装日本的阴霾，在明天就可能变为降落到他们头上的灾祸。如果不制止帝国主义今天在朝鲜、越南、马来亚等地进行的侵略战争，不制止日本的重新军国主义化，那么亚洲及太平洋地区各弱小民族争取自由独立的斗争是难以达到最后目的的。因此争取自己祖国的自由独立和爱好和平的人们，都必须把他们自己的民族解放斗争和反对新战争的斗争密切地结合起来。
    欧洲人民民主国家的舆论界十分重视亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    柏林各民主报纸都以显著地位刊载了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的告世界人民书及致联合国书。“新德意志报”十五日以“亚洲人民正在起来反抗美国侵略者”为题，发表社论说：“毫无疑问，北京和平会议标志着亚洲各国人民争取和平及民族独立的共同斗争已走上了最高峰。”并说：“北京的和平会议证明，美国垄断资本家再也不能恢复他们在远东的已经瓦解的帝国主义战线了。”社论接着说：“北京和平会议的重要性对于我们德国人格外明显。美国在西方的侵略战争准备和它对朝鲜、越南和马来亚的侵略，显然可以看得出是齐头并进的。美国在波恩和巴黎缔结的两国军事协定跟美国与日本吉田政府之间的战争条约也显然是并行的。因此，亚洲人民的每一个成就都是对我们争取全国统一与和平的斗争的宝贵帮助。”捷克斯洛伐克共产党机关报“红色权利报”十九日以“三分之二的人类的和平呼声”为题，发表评论指出：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的讨论，有力地显示了世界和平运动力量的日益壮大，和强大的反对战争的民主阵线的牢不可破的团结。会议的讨论表明了各国和平保卫者和苏联的休戚相关与持久的友谊。评论说：中华人民共和国的成立给予世界帝国主义以巨大的打击，北京和平会议强调了各国人民日益增强的、要击败美帝国主义战争计划的决心。各国人民保卫和平的世界性运动，由北京会议得到了新的、有力的支持；会议的结果将使保卫和平运动在更大的规模上动员整个和平民主阵营来积极准备世界人民和平大会。亚洲及太平洋各国和平战士们的会议，使得防止另一次世界大战的斗争的最后胜利更为接近了。
    西欧各国舆论界也十分关注亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    伦敦“工人日报”十四日以显著地位刊载亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的闭幕会议上通过的告世界人民书和致联合国书，以及北京市民在北京太和殿举行庆祝这一历史性会议闭幕的盛大群众大会的消息，并发表了题为“亚洲的呼声”的社论。社论写道：当十六亿人民发出呼声并要求结束朝鲜战争的时候，全世界必须予以注意。这是亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在结束它的北京会议时所发出的一致呼声。社论并强调说：“英国人民支持从马来亚撤退军队的要求。”
