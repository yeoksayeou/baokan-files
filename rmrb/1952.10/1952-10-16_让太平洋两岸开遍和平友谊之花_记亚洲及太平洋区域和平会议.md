Let the Flowers of Peace and Friendship Bloom on Both Sides of the Pacific
——A Record of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference By Our Reporter

In the city of Beijing, where white doves soar and songs echo, in a majestic and splendid hall illuminated by lights, the flags of thirty-eight countries are lined up, and the representatives of the people of thirty-seven countries sit side by side. From here, they send out the loudest and most beautiful sound in the world: Peace!

In these days, from the steppes of Central Asia to the coasts of Australia, from the towns of Japan to the mountain villages of Chile, from the ancient cities of India to the commercial ports of America—1.6 billion peace-loving people living on the Asian continent and along the Pacific coast are watching Beijing and listening to Beijing.

To bring the best hopes of the people to the peace conference, the peace representatives crossed mountains and ridges, traversed vast seas, circled half the equator, passed through four continents and an ocean, and even crossed the barbed wire of lies and the iron curtain of denied passports created by war instigators. Beijing—Peace. This destination gave them inspiring strength.

People still remember the past years when imperialists used cannons and warships to blast open the gates of ancient China. They came to our land to seek gold, silver, treasures, and blood, creating war, poverty, and hatred… All those who upheld truth and justice, whether Chinese or foreign, were subjected to terror and persecution in China at that time. But we finally smashed the shackles of enslavement and raised high the banner of freedom and peace. It is only because the Chinese people drove out the foreign invaders and bloodsuckers that such a grand gathering of peace defenders as today is possible in our capital. Only because of this is it possible for peace envoys to open their hearts, say what they want to say, and sing what they want to sing on the sun-drenched land of youthful China.

The world-renowned poet Nazim Hikmet stepped onto the podium of the peace conference and said, "Friends! This venue seems to me like a garden of peace and friendship, with flowers of all colors blooming together." The poet's feeling and language are profound and clear.

Here, you can see black people and white people, yellow people and brown people, sitting side by side in rows of rose-red velvet chairs. Here are our neighbors, the Soviets and Indians, as well as the Chileans and Iraqis who are "far away." In front of the blooming irises and next to the evergreen palm trees, you can see Ceylonese monks in robes and Burmese artists in "Longyi" sarongs, Pakistani female representatives in "Sari" gowns and Syrian elders in pale yellow "Abaya" robes, as well as Indian Gandhi followers wearing clothes made of homespun white cloth. They pursue different professions, live different lives, and have different religious beliefs and political views. Among them are Indian members of parliament and Pakistani Muslim leaders, Japanese trade union workers and American young female students, Australian Christian pastors and Colombian agricultural workers, passionate Tajik poets and Mexican archaeologists, Canadian fisheries operators and Iranian university professors, New Zealand housewives and Costa Rican devout Catholics, as well as patriotic writers and film actors from heroic Korea, labor models and female guerrilla heroes from fighting Vietnam… They may not know each other, they may not speak the same language, they have not spent time together day and night, nor have they had intimate conversations, but they understand each other deeply because they are working together for the peace and happiness of mankind. An Indian Congressman expressed complete agreement with the speech of the leader of the Indian Communist Party in Parliament at the peace conference, and he sincerely said: "Although we are opposed to each other in Congress, in the peace movement, we are engaged in common cause together."

Many representatives in their speeches depicted a painful picture of the last World War. The people of Pacific countries still have fresh memories of the disasters caused by the Japanese militarists' war of aggression. The Chinese people have not forgotten: ten million people lost their lives, and $50 billion in property was looted or destroyed. The Indonesian people have not forgotten: two million people were forced into war labor, dying in large numbers in other lands, leaving behind three million widows and orphans. The Burmese people have also not forgotten: Japanese invading troops forced Burmese people to build railways and highways, forcing them to engage in slave-like labor in sparsely populated areas where malaria was prevalent, resulting in the death of 200,000 people. In Bengal, India, due to the impact of the war, 3.5 million people starved to death in 1943. The northern seaports of Australia were bombed, and captured Australian soldiers were subjected to inhuman torture in Japanese fascist prisoner-of-war camps. The people of Vietnam, Malaya, Thailand, and the Philippines also suffered greatly from the ravages of war. The Japanese people understand even more deeply what war has brought them, millions of people died on the mainland, on the southern islands, and in the waves of the Coral Sea, and more than 100,000 residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were tragically killed in the inhumane atomic bomb attacks. Except for those who are blinded by the pursuit of bloody profits, except for those who hate the world, hate peace, and shout "the end of the world," except for those bloodthirsty fascist bandits who prefer skulls and bones and like to use human skin as lampshades, how can all good people not deeply reflect on these facts? How can we allow these terrible histories of blood to repeat themselves before our eyes?

Japanese representative Kogura Kinkichi said passionately: "From the bottom of my heart, I want to shout 'Support peace,' 'No more repeating the tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.' I will convey to you the determination and wishes of tens of millions of Japanese youth and mothers, and I sincerely hope to unite more closely with the people of all ethnic groups in Asia and the Pacific region to advance towards the great struggle to defend peace!"

However, war for the Asia-Pacific region is more than just a threat! While our peace conference is in progress, the war of aggression against Korea launched by the United States government is continuing, and tons of steel and gunpowder are being poured wildly into Korean cities and villages, hospitals and schools, and the flames of war are scorching the beautiful mountains and rivers of Korea. Moreover, representatives of the US government announced on October 8 the indefinite suspension of Korean armistice talks, attempting to expand the flames of war in this region. In Vietnam and Malaya, the wars of armed intervention conducted by British and French colonists with the support of US imperialism are also underway—British and French peace representatives said that the people in their countries hate this war to the core, and they call it a "dirty war."

The heroic Korean people stand at the forefront of the struggle to defend peace. The white-clad Korean women are a symbol of peace, and all honest people in Asia and the world sincerely support her. At the peace conference, people listened to every word of the Korean representatives with the utmost respect and responded with the warmest applause. The seats of the Korean delegation were filled with flags, flowers, and gifts presented to them by delegations from various countries, as well as the Indian lamp symbolizing light—“Jyoti.”

Although the US government has made the Stars and Stripes a symbol of disaster everywhere in the world and stained it with blood in Korea, the representatives of the American people have planted a clean American flag at the peace conference. Although at the same time, American soldiers are slaughtering Korean people near the 38th parallel, at the Peace Conference held at 40 degrees North latitude in Beijing, in front of the representatives of the people of Asian and Pacific region countries, American representatives and Korean representatives embraced each other. This is a demonstration to the war profiteers. Let them tremble, because they are most afraid of the friendship and unity of the people.

The American delegation presented Korea with an evergreen tree, and delegation leader Eaton read the following lines in a deep, solemn tone:

"We, the American people, praise courage and hate cruelty; we ask you to plant this small tree on the land of Korea, the land that has become sacred because it is stained with the blood of heroic people. May this small tree grow like the friendship between our two peoples; may this small tree and the green leaves of life nourished by sunshine and rain grow evergreen, sheltering your children and grandchildren in a safe, beautiful, and peaceful environment."

This is the voice of the America of Lincoln and Whitman. This lofty voice of the American people will eventually overwhelm and stifle the shameful clamor of those war profiteers!

Another moving scene of unity appeared on the podium. The delegations from India and Pakistan signed a joint statement on the spot, stating that they would use the spirit of goodwill consultation to resolve all outstanding issues between the two countries. Indian delegation leader Dr. Kitchlew presented a lacquer box made in Kashmir and a tapestry embroidered with a scene of the Summer Palace in Beijing to Pakistani delegation leader Sharif, and Sharif presented a gold-embroidered hat symbolizing brotherly love and a wooden box carved in Beijing to Dr. Kitchlew. Imperialists incite Hindus and Muslims to hate and slaughter each other, but here, the representatives of India and Pakistan responded to the instigators with close unity. As one Indian representative said: India and Pakistan are like two pieces of gold and stone, beginning to melt together in the fire of peace and friendship at this conference.

The venue was filled with an atmosphere of solidarity and friendship among the people, and it was also full of hatred and anger towards the instigators of war and aggressors.

People thought: Why are the sons of Turkey forced to wear American uniforms, cross thousands of mountains and rivers, and go to Korea to be murderers and cannon fodder? Why has Colombia never had hatred with Korea, and overnight it became an accomplice in military intervention against a distant nation with a similar fate to itself? Countless facts have given everyone a clear idea: peace and national independence are inseparable. A country that loses its sovereignty cannot guarantee a peaceful life, and will be dragged into the vortex of war by war profiteers at any time, whether this war occurs on the country's border or on the other side of the earth.

The representatives talked about the economic plunder of other countries by imperialism. Southeast Asia is inhabited by hardworking and intelligent laboring people and has abundant rubber, tin, rice, cotton, and oil. However, workers in the Philippines cannot get enough to eat, the lives of the people of Ceylon are in dire straits, the childhood lives of Pakistani children have to be spent on dirty streets, and Indonesian industrialists and businessmen are going bankrupt one after another. Representatives from Latin America tell us: there is beautiful land there, growing all kinds of tropical fruit trees: coffee and cocoa, bananas and sugar cane, with tin and copper, oil and nitrates buried underground. However, workers in Nicaragua labor all day long under tropical palm trees but do not receive the minimum living treatment, many miners in Honduras die from lung disease, and the hands of the people of Costa Rica are as gray and dry as agave...

The speeches of these representatives reflected the strong desire of the people of oppressed countries for national independence. Whether in Japan or the Philippines, in the Middle East or in Latin America, this cry for freedom has merged with the cry for peace. The peace representatives were encouraged by the example of new China, and they saw with their own eyes that liberated China has become a powerful force in defending peace. To express this feeling, the Costa Rican representatives presented the Chinese people with a medal awarded by their government to a patriotic warrior who resisted American aggression in 1856.

The representatives not only shared the feelings of peace and friendship, but were also deeply moved by the spirit of full democratic consultation. This spirit of democratic consultation was implemented in all aspects of the conference: frank and enthusiastic debates in the group meetings, repeated revisions of the draft declaration, and opinions were respected regardless of whether they came from large or small countries. The representative from Ecuador said: "Only in this kind of conference where true people's representatives gather together can small countries like Ecuador freely express their voices." Even when the presidium repeatedly discussed and passed draft resolutions, the individual opinions of each representative were adopted as much as possible when they were submitted to the plenary session for voting. It was precisely this spirit that enabled hundreds of people with different views to reach a surprising consensus on each issue raised. The conference declaration and various resolutions were not passed by a majority vote, but were unanimously passed without a single vote against or a single abstention.

The eleven-day conference, which began on October 2, will undoubtedly promote the peace movement of 1.6 billion people to a new historical stage. Representatives from all walks of life from thirty-seven countries have reached a consensus on important issues related to peace in the Asian and Pacific regions, found solutions to these issues, and formulated a common program of action - the conference declaration and various resolutions. This is a historic victory for 1.6 billion people. This victory will encourage the people of all countries to speed up their pace and will also shock the enemies of peace. The great achievements of the peace conference have completely bankrupted the various ravings and slanders of the enemy, and those war instigators who tried to dilute the significance of this conference with rumors are already panicking and shouting "It would be a mistake to dismiss it (referring to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference - reporter's note) as unimportant."

Let the seeds of peace and friendship take root, develop, and spread to every corner on both sides of the Pacific! Let the instigators of war and the creators of racial hatred be drowned in the vast and deep ocean of peace!

    让太平洋两岸开遍和平友谊之花
    ——记亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议  本报记者
    在白鸽翱翔、歌声回荡的北京城，在庄严瑰丽、灯光辉映的大厅里，三十八个国家的旗帜排成一行，三十七个国家人民的代表并肩坐在一起。他们从这儿发出世界上最宏亮和最美丽的声音：和平！
    在这些日子里，从中亚细亚的草原到澳大利亚的海岸，从日本的城镇到智利的山村，从印度的古城到美国的商港——生活在亚洲大陆和太平洋之滨的十六亿爱好和平的人民都瞩望着北京，倾听着北京。
    和平代表们为了把人民心中最好的希望带到和平会场，他们有的越过丛山峻岭，有的渡过辽阔的大海，有的绕过半个赤道，有的经过四个洲和一个洋，有的更跨过战争挑拨者所制造的谎言的藩篱和拒发护照的名符其实的铁幕。北京——和平。这个目的地给了他们鼓舞的力量。
    人们还记得往昔的岁月，那时候帝国主义者用大炮兵舰轰开了古老中国的大门。他们到我们土地上寻找金银、财宝和鲜血，制造战争、贫困和仇恨……。凡是维护真理和正义的人们，不管是中国人，外国人，那时在中国都要受到恐怖的迫害。但是我们终于砸碎了奴役的枷锁，高举起自由与和平的大旗。只是因为中国人民赶走了外国侵略者和吸血鬼，像今日这样和平保卫者的盛大集会，才有可能在我国的首都召开。只是因为这样，和平使者们才有可能在青春中国的阳光普照的土地上，打开心扉，说想说的话，唱想唱的歌。
    世界著名的诗人希克梅特走上了和平会议的讲台，他说：“朋友们！这个会场在我的眼前好像是一座和平与友谊的花园，各种颜色的花朵一齐怒放。”诗人的感觉和语言是深刻而明快的。
    这儿，你可以看到，有黑种人和白种人，黄种人和棕种人，他们并肩地坐在一排排的玫瑰红色的绒椅上。这儿有我们的近邻苏联人和印度人，也有“远在天涯”的智利人和伊拉克人。在盛开的鸢尾花前，在常青的棕榈树旁，你可以看到身披袈裟的锡兰法师和穿着“龙格”短褂的缅甸艺术家，披着“沙丽”的巴基斯坦女代表和穿着淡黄色“阿巴亚”的叙利亚老人，还有印度的甘地信徒，穿着用手摇纺车织成的白布的衣裳。他们从事不同的职业，过着不同的生活，有着不同的宗教信仰和政治见解。他们之中有印度的国会议员和巴基斯坦的回教领袖，日本的工会工作者和美国的青年女学生，澳大利亚的基督教牧师和哥伦比亚的农业工人，塔吉克的热情诗人和墨西哥的考古学家，加拿大的渔业经营者和伊朗的大学教授，新西兰的家庭妇女和哥斯达黎加的虔诚的天主教徒，还有来自英雄朝鲜的爱国作家和电影演员，来自战斗越南的劳动模范和游击队女英雄……。他们也许互不相识，也许语言不通，他们不曾朝夕相处，也不曾促膝长谈，但是他们彼此深深了解了因为他们正在共同为人类的和平与幸福而斗争。印度的一位国大党国会议员表示完全同意印度共产党在国会中的领袖在和平会议上的发言，他诚挚地说：“虽然在国会里我们是互相对立的，但是在和平运动中我们一起从事共同事业。”
    好些代表们在他们的发言中描绘出一幅上次世界大战的悲痛景象。太平洋各国人民对日本军国主义的侵略战争所曾造成的灾难记忆犹新。中国人民不曾忘记：一千万人失去了生命，五百亿美元的财产已被劫去或毁灭。印尼人民不曾忘记：二百万人充当战争劳役，大批地死在他乡，遗下了三百万寡妇和孤儿。缅甸人民也不曾忘记：日本侵略军队强迫缅甸人修建铁路和公路，强迫他们在人烟稀少的疟疾流行地区从事奴隶般的劳动，以致死去了二十万人。印度的孟加拉一地，由于战争的影响，一九四三年饿死了三百五十万人。澳大利亚的北部海港曾遭到轰炸，被俘的澳大利亚士兵在日本法西斯俘虏营中受到非人的酷刑。越南、马来亚、泰国和菲律宾的人民也都饱受过战火的灾祸。日本人民更深深懂得战争给他们带来了什么，数百万人死在大陆上、南方的岛屿上和珊瑚海的波涛中，广岛和长崎的十万多居民在毁灭人道的原子弹攻击之下惨遭死亡。除了那些为攫取血腥利润弄昏了头脑的人，除了那些憎恨世界、憎恨和平，叫嚷着“世界末日”的人，除了那些偏爱骷髅和白骨、喜欢用人皮作灯罩的嗜血成性的法西斯匪徒，一切善良的人怎能不为这些事实而有所深思呢？怎能允许这些可怕的血的历史在我们的面前重演呢？
    日本代表小仓金吉激昂地说：“我从心里要高呼‘拥护和平’，‘不再重复广岛和长崎的悲剧’。我将数千万日本青年和母亲的决心和愿望向诸位传达，衷心地希望和亚洲及太平洋区各民族人民更加紧密地团结起来向伟大的保卫和平斗争前进！”
    然而战争对于亚洲及太平洋区域，岂止是威胁！就在我们的和平会议进行时，美国政府所发动的侵略朝鲜的战争正在继续着，成吨的钢铁和火药不停地向着朝鲜的城市和乡村、医院和学校疯狂地倾泻，战火烧焦了朝鲜的锦绣山河。而且美国政府的代表已在十月八日宣布无限期中止朝鲜停战谈判，企图使这个地区的战火扩大地燃烧。在越南和马来亚，英法殖民者在美帝国主义的支持之下所进行的武装干涉的战争也在进行着——英国和法国的和平代表们说，他们国内的人民厌恨透了这个战争，他们称它为“肮脏的战争”。
    英雄的朝鲜人民站在保卫和平的斗争的最前线。白衣的朝鲜妇女是和平的象征，全亚洲和全世界的正直人民都衷心地支持她。在和平会场上，人们用最尊敬的心情倾听着朝鲜代表的每一句话，用最热烈的鼓掌来回答他们。朝鲜代表团的席位上放满了各国代表团献给他们的旗帜、鲜花和礼品，还有印度的象征光明的灯——“觉谛”。
    尽管美国政府使星条旗在世界各处变为灾难的象征，并使它在朝鲜沾上血污，但是美国人民的代表却把清洁的美国国旗插在和平会场上。尽管在这同时，美国士兵正在北纬三十八度附近屠杀朝鲜人民，但是在这北纬四十度的北京举行的和平会议的主席台上，在亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民代表的面前，美国代表和朝鲜代表拥抱在一起了。这是向战争贩子的示威。让他们发抖吧，因为他们最害怕人民的友谊和团结。
    美国代表团献给朝鲜一棵常青树，团长惠吞用深沉、庄重的语调朗读了这样的诗句：
    “我们美国人民，赞美勇敢，憎恨残暴；我们请求你们把这棵小树，种在朝鲜的土地上，那块因染上英雄人民的血而变得神圣的土地上。愿这棵小树像我们两国人民的友谊一般生长；愿这棵小树和受着阳光与雨露滋养的生命的绿叶一起长青，用它的绿荫在安全、美好与和平的环境中，庇护着你们的子子孙孙。”
    这是林肯和惠特曼的美国的声音。这种崇高的美国人民的声音终将压倒并窒息那些战争贩子的可耻叫嚣！
    另一个动人的团结场面出现在主席台上。印度和巴基斯坦的代表团当场签署了联合声明，他们表示用善意的协商精神来解决两国间一切悬而未决的问题。印度代表团团长克其鲁博士把一个在克什米尔制造的漆盒和一幅绣有北京颐和园风景的织锦送给巴基斯坦代表团团长沙里夫，沙里夫把一顶象征兄弟之爱的金线绣的帽子和一个在北京雕刻的木盒送给克其鲁博士。帝国主义挑拨印度教人和回教人互相仇视、互相屠杀，但是在这里，印巴两国的代表用亲密的团结回答了挑拨者。正如一位印度代表说：印巴两国好比两块金石，在这次会议的和平与友谊之火中开始熔合起来了。
    会场上洋溢着人民之间的团结友好的气氛，也充满着对战争挑拨者和侵略者的憎恨和愤怒情绪。
    人们想到：为什么土耳其的子弟会被迫穿上美国制服，越过千山万水，到朝鲜去做杀人犯和送死鬼呢？为什么哥伦比亚从来不曾和朝鲜有过仇恨，而在一夜功夫就变成对一个遥远的、和自己命运一样的民族实行军事干涉的同谋犯呢？无数的事实使大家得到一个明澈的观念：和平与民族独立是不可分的。一个国家丧失了主权就不能保证和平生活，就随时要被战争贩子拖进战争的漩涡中，不论这个战争是发生在这个国家的边境，还是发生在地球的另一面。
    代表们谈到帝国主义对别国的经济掠夺。在东南亚居住着勤俭而聪明的劳动人民，有着丰饶的橡胶、锡、米、棉和石油，但是，菲律宾的工人不得温饱，锡兰人民的生活陷于绝境，巴基斯坦儿童的幼年生活要在肮脏的街道上度过，印尼的工商业者纷纷破产。拉丁美洲的代表们告诉我们：那儿有着美好的土地，生长着各种热带果树：咖啡和可可，香蕉和甘蔗，地下埋藏着锡和铜，石油和硝酸盐。但是尼加拉瓜的工人在热带棕榈树下整日劳动却得不到最低生活的待遇，洪都拉斯的许多矿工因肺病而死亡，哥斯达黎加人民的手像龙舌兰那样灰白和枯燥……。
    这些代表的发言反映了被压迫国家人民要求民族独立的强烈愿望。不论在日本还是在菲律宾，在中东还是在拉丁美洲，这种要求自由的呼声已经和要求和平的呼声汇合在一起了。和平代表们为新中国的榜样所鼓舞，他们亲眼看到解放了的中国已成为保卫和平的强大力量。为了表达这种感情，哥斯达黎加代表把他们政府授与一八五六年反抗美国侵略的爱国勇士的一个勋章，赠给了中国人民。
    代表们不仅分享着和平与友谊的感情，同时也为充分的民主协商精神而深深感动。这种民主协商精神贯彻在会议的各个方面：小组会里率直而热烈的辩论，宣言起草的一次又一次地修改，不论大国和小国，意见都受到尊重。厄瓜多尔的代表说：“只有在这种真正的人民代表聚会一堂的会议上，像厄瓜多尔这样的小国才能自由地发出他们的声音。”甚至当主席团反复讨论，已经通过的各项决议草案，在付诸全体大会表决的时候，对每一代表的个人意见都尽量采纳。正是这种精神，使数百名见解不同的人，对提出的每个问题，都获得了惊人的一致。大会宣言及各项决议，不是多数通过，而是没有一票反对没有一票弃权地全体一致通过的。
    从十月二日开始的十一天的会议，无疑将推动十六亿人民的和平运动走向新的历史阶段。来自三十七个国家的各个阶层的代表，对有关亚洲及太平洋区域和平的各项重要问题，获得了一致的看法，找到了解决这些问题的办法，制订了共同的行动纲领——大会宣言及各项决议。这是十六亿人民历史性的胜利。这胜利将鼓舞各国人民加紧步伐，也会使和平的敌人震惊。和平会议的伟大成就已使敌人的各种呓语和诽谤完全破产，那些企图用谣言来冲淡这次会议的意义的战争挑拨者们已经在张皇失措地叫喊着“斥责它（指亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议—记者按）毫不重要，那将是一个错误。”
    让和平与友谊的种子在太平洋两岸生根、发展，散布到每个角落吧！让战争挑拨者、种族仇恨的制造者们淹没在辽阔深邃的和平海洋中吧！
