-- "Southern Expedition and Northern War"

Screenwriters: Shen Ximeng, Shen Mojun, Gu Baozhang　Directors: Cheng Yin, Tang Xiaodan, Shanghai Film Studio, 1952

The film "Southern Expedition and Northern War" is an excellent work depicting the People's Liberation War with high ideological and artistic value. It artistically and vividly expresses Chairman Mao's genius strategic thinking on mobile warfare. This is the first film that attempts to positively portray Chairman Mao's great strategic thinking and has achieved initial success.

The film truthfully expresses this theme with vivid images, typical characters, and events. The story depicted in the film is as follows: In the early stages of the People's Liberation War, our army, based on the situation of the enemy being strong and we being weak, implemented Chairman Mao's strategic policy of mobile warfare. Although our army won seven battles and seven victories in northern Jiangsu, and won battles every day, in order to annihilate the enemy's effective strength, and from the long-term interests of the people and the overall situation of the war, we had to make a strategic retreat, withdrawing from Jiangsu to Shandong. Then, we withdrew from Taocun, the most important strategic stronghold on the Jinpu Railway, and moved in large strides to the Yimeng Mountain area of Shandong, highly concentrating our main forces, and then advanced in large strides, annihilating an enemy force that had moved south from the Jiaoji Railway. Then, taking advantage of the victory, we turned back and pursued and annihilated the exhausted and isolated enemy force that had dragged from Jiangsu to Shandong, and the lost Taocun was returned to our possession. Our army annihilated the enemy's superior forces and achieved a decisive victory on the East China battlefield, preparing favorable conditions for the subsequent large-scale counteroffensive. The film's story begins in Taocun and ends in Taocun. Through the before and after process of this village's one loss and one gain, it convincingly demonstrates the brilliance and greatness of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking on mobile warfare, and clearly shows the just nature of the Liberation War and the excellent qualities of the People's Liberation Army. The film does not use a lot of "theory" or pile up a lot of historical facts to publicize Chairman Mao's military thinking of "not caring about the gains and losses of one city or one place," and does not use conceptualized writing to explain the relationship between the people and the Liberation War, as well as the cooperation between regular troops and local militia. Instead, it expresses the theme through the vivid depiction of several main characters, through their ideological changes and actions, and through the organic connection between various relationships.

The film tightly grasps the theme, raises the question at the beginning, and deepens the theme step by step with the development of the story. Every event and every person written in the film revolves closely around the theme.

The film depicts that when our army initially implemented the policy of mobile warfare, the thinking of our soldiers and lower-level cadres was not consistent with the intentions of the leadership; the thinking of the masses also had contradictions with the guiding ideology of the war. We see from the film that the significance of the strategic thinking of mobile warfare was not understood by every soldier and lower-level cadre from the beginning. They couldn't understand why "we win battles every day, but retreat every day." When the troops retreated, the soldiers suppressed their emotions of not wanting to retreat and demanding to continue fighting, and some made sarcastic remarks: "Counterattack, counterattack, counterattacking to Shandong." The masses felt uncomfortable, and the company commander couldn't figure it out. These depictions are very realistic. Not only were lower-level cadres and soldiers like this, but even middle-level cadres sometimes couldn't figure it out. Battalion Commander Gao said: "To be honest, division commander, the troops are now full of fighting spirit, and we are about to transfer north again... I'm afraid this turn won't be easy to make." The thinking expressed here is essentially no different from the thinking of the aforementioned soldiers. But this is also true thinking. This temporary lack of understanding is also an inevitable phenomenon. Because their understanding is limited and one-sided, they did not understand the great significance of the retreat from the overall war, which was to eliminate more enemies. Losing the immediate grass, trees, mountains, and rivers was to gain greater victory. Although their thinking was not clear for a time, our troops are highly organized and disciplined, and subordinates have unlimited trust in the leadership of their superiors. Therefore, the orders of superiors are resolutely implemented by subordinates. The film movingly portrays this noble quality of the People's Liberation Army. The situation of the People's Liberation War was developing rapidly, and the thinking of soldiers and lower-level cadres also changed in the practice of war. When they deeply realized the correctness of the superior leadership from their own experience, when they got rid of their limitations and paid attention to the overall situation, their thinking immediately became consistent with the leadership's thinking. We can see from the film that the soldiers Liu Yonggui, Wang Chun, and Company Commander Zhang all underwent very significant ideological changes later. They initially complained about the troops retreating, but when they annihilated a large number of enemies and achieved great victories, Liu Yonggui said: "Squad leader, this direction is right, it's worth losing ten Taocuns, let alone one." Wang Chun also said: "This four hundred and fifty li journey was not in vain, I wouldn't mind running four thousand five hundred li if I had known!" Company Commander Zhang also said: "I really didn't expect...". These changes in their thinking are very natural and very real.

The masses also reversed their thinking in the struggle, showing a tenacious fighting spirit. They obeyed the needs of the entire war, organized guerrilla teams, inserted themselves behind enemy lines, and powerfully cooperated with the regular troops in combat, making the enemy beaten everywhere and uneasy, creating extremely favorable conditions for annihilating the enemy. The scene where the guerrillas cut the electric wires of the exploding sluice gate, ensuring the victorious crossing of the river and defeating the enemy by the attacking troops, is very moving. In the film, we not only see the struggles waged by village chief Zhao Yumin and the male and female militia guerrillas, but also the powerful support of the stretcher teams and transportation teams for the troops. All these people and scenes are constantly active on the screen, and they are a reliable guarantee for the victory of the war. The film succinctly expresses the connection between the broad masses of the people and the war, explaining the people's nature of the war. The power of the people is the source of victory in the Liberation War and the true copper wall and iron wall of the People's Liberation Army.

The film profoundly expresses the just nature of the war with the soldiers' affectionate feelings for their hometown. Taocun is where the wife and children of the soldier Liu Yonggui live, and the soldiers are all from the Taocun area. What the enemy wants to occupy and destroy are thousands upon thousands of villages like Taocun, and what our soldiers are sacrificing blood to defend are exactly those places. The purpose of the war is to defend the liberated areas, to defend the liberated grass, trees, and to defend their families and happiness. When the troops fought back, Liu Yonggui held the river water in his hands and said affectionately: "Today I am drinking the water of my hometown again." What a strong feeling this vivid description of the nature of the war gives people! The just nature of the war is one of the fundamental reasons for the victory of the revolutionary war.

From the film, we also see the arduousness of the war and the optimism of the people's army that is expressed from the arduous struggle. The war is indeed arduous. Marching and transferring every day, trekking long distances. The enemy is mechanized, and we are millet plus rifles. Climbing high mountains and ridges, walking roads rarely traveled. Wounded and sacrificed on the battlefield. The valuable quality of the People's Liberation Army is not to avoid difficulties, but to find ways to overcome them, and not to be pessimistic or bow their heads in the face of difficulties. This is true optimism. As long as we slightly recall the marching scenes and combat scenes in the film (such as the battle for the General Temple Railway Station), the performance of Company Commander Zhang and Battalion Commander Gao after being wounded, and the various scenes of the soldier Wang Chun blowing up enemy tanks, we will understand this more deeply. The film handles this issue very well. It correctly portrays the cruelty and difficulties of the war, and therefore also correctly portrays revolutionary optimism; it neither dogmatically denies any hardship, nor does it have the petty-bourgeois hypocritical "optimism."

The film is also successful in creating character images. It has achieved particular success in creating the image of senior cadres. The division commander played by Comrade Chen Ge portrays the most important characteristics of senior cadres in our army who have been tempered by long-term struggle. He is loyal, brave, calm, thoughtful, and wise, and is a person armed with the Marxist-Leninist military science and Mao Zedong's military thought. Although this character is not life-like enough and the language still seems somewhat stiff, it should be said that this is a relatively successful attempt by our films to create the image of senior commanders.

Although the characters of soldiers and village cadres (such as the female village chief Zhao Yumin) are not prominent enough, they all have well-portrayed aspects, and many of their excellent qualities are also expressed. Company Commander Zhang and Zhao Yumin are relatively memorable characters.

The film also depicts the enemy well, without exaggerating the enemy's fierce arrogance or portraying the enemy as weak and incompetent. The enemy also has war experience, but because the war they are waging is anti-people, they cannot achieve victory and are finally annihilated. The film appropriately expresses the anti-people nature of the enemy, the infighting between their generals, and their shameful defeat.

The language in the film is also relatively lively and vivid, and is literary language that has been extracted from life. There are not many formulaic languages in this film.

The success of "Southern Expedition and Northern War" proves that we are fully qualified and capable of producing films with high ideological and artistic value, as long as writers, directors, and actors are willing to make arduous efforts.

The success of "Southern Expedition and Northern War" also further proves the importance of literary and art workers going deep into life. The reason why Comrades Shen Ximeng and others were able to write such a good screenplay is inseparable from their long-term life in the army and familiarity with the life of the army; and it is inseparable from the direct and specific guidance of the army's leadership comrades. The reason why the film was shot so well and the actors performed so well is inseparable from hard work and going deep into life, and it is also inseparable from the efforts of the troops assisting in the performance and the earnest and responsible guidance of the military advisors.

    体现毛主席伟大战略思想的优秀影片
    ——“南征北战”
    张立云
    编剧：沈西蒙、沈默君、顾宝璋　导演：成　荫、汤晓丹上海电影制片厂一九五二年出品
    影片“南征北战”是一部描写人民解放战争的、具有很高的思想性和艺术性的优秀作品。它艺术地、形象地表现了毛主席的天才的运动战的战略思想。这是第一部试图从正面表现毛主席伟大战略思想并获得了初步成功的影片。
    影片用生动的形象，用典型人物和事迹把这个主题思想真实地表现了出来。影片所描写的故事是这样的：在人民解放战争初期，我军根据敌强我弱的情况，执行着毛主席运动战的战略方针。我军虽然在苏北七战七捷，天天打胜仗，但是为了歼灭敌人的有生力量，从人民的长远利益和战争的全局出发，便不得不作战略性的退却，从江苏撤到山东。接着，又撤出了津浦路上最重要的一个战略据点——桃村，大踏步转移到山东沂蒙山区，高度集中了我军的主力，又大踏步前进，歼灭了从胶济路南下的一路敌军。然后，乘胜回转头来，又追歼了从江苏拖到山东来的疲惫、孤立的敌军，失去的桃村重新归我所有。我军歼灭了敌人的优势兵力，在华东战场上取得了决定性的胜利，为以后的大反攻准备了有利条件。影片故事以桃村为起点，又以桃村为结束。通过这个村庄的一失一得的前后经过，令人信服地把毛主席的运动战的战略思想的英明与伟大，把解放战争的正义性和人民解放军的优秀品质表现得清清楚楚。影片并没有用很多的“理论”，或堆砌很多的史实，来宣扬毛主席的“不在一城一地的得失”的军事思想，没有用概念化的写法去说明人民和解放战争的关系以及正规的部队与地方民兵的配合，而是通过对几个主要人物的生动描写，通过他们的思想变化和行动，以及各种关系之间的有机联系，来表现主题的。
    影片紧紧地掌握了主题，一开始就提出了问题，并随着故事的发展，一步一步地使主题深刻化。影片中所写的每一件事，每一个人，都紧密地围绕着主题思想在活动着。
    影片描写了我军最初执行运动战的方针时，我军的战士以及下级干部的思想和领导意图不能一致；人民群众的思想和战争的指导思想也有矛盾。我们从影片里看到，运动战的战略思想的意义，并不是
    一开始就为每一个战士和下级干部所理解的。他们搞不通为什么“天天打胜仗，天天往后撤”。当部队后撤时，战士压抑着不愿后撤要求继续战斗的情绪，有的说怪话：“反攻反攻，反到山东”。群众心里不舒服，连长思想搞不通，这些描写都很真实。不但下级干部和战士如此，中级干部的思想也有搞不通的时候。高营长就说过这样的话：“说实话，师长，现在部队斗志正旺，马上又要向北转移。……这个弯子怕一下转不过来。”这里表现出的思想，本质上和前述战士的思想没有区别。但这也是真实的思想。这种思想上的一时不通，也是难免的现象。因为他们的认识是有局限性、片面性的，没有从战争的整体上去了解退却的伟大意义是为了消灭更多的敌人，丢掉了眼前的一草一木，一山一水，是为了获得更大的胜利。思想虽然一时不通，但我们的部队是有高度组织性、纪律性的部队，下级对上级的领导是无限信任的。所以，上级的命令，下级仍坚决贯彻执行。影片对人民解放军这一高贵品质表现得很动人。人民解放战争的形势是急转直下地发展着，战士和下级干部的思想也在战争的实践中有了转变。当他们从切身经验中深刻体会了上级领导的正确时，当他们摆脱了局限性而注意到全局的时候，他们的思想就立刻和领导思想一致起来了。我们从影片中可以看到：战士刘永贵、王春，以及张连长到后来都发生了很显著的思想上的变化。他们最初埋怨部队往后撤，但当他们歼灭了大批敌人，获得了伟大的胜利时，刘永贵说：“班长，这个方向跑对了，不要说丢一个桃村，丢掉十个也值得。”王春也说：“这四百五十里路跑得不冤枉，早知道跑四千五百里也没意见！”张连长也说：
    “真没想到……”。他们思想上的这些变化是很自然，很真实的。
    人民群众也在斗争中扭转了思想，表现了顽强的战斗精神。他们服从整个战争的需要，组织了游击队，插到敌后，有力地配合了正规部队的作战，使敌人到处挨打、不安，给歼灭敌人创造了极有利的条件。像游击队剪断了爆炸水闸的电线，保证了正在进攻的部队胜利渡河、击溃敌人的场面，是很动人的。我们在影片里，不但看到了村长赵玉敏和男女民兵游击队所进行的斗争，也看到了担架队、运输队对于部队的有力的支援。这一切人，一切场面，都不断地在银幕上活动着，他们是战争胜利的可靠保证。影片扼要地表现了广大人民和战争的关联，说明了战争的人民性。人民的力量是解放战争胜利的源泉，是解放军真正的铜墙铁壁。
    影片以战士对家乡热爱的亲切的感情，深刻地表现了战争的正义性。桃村这个地方，住着战士刘永贵的老婆和孩子，战士们都是桃村一带的人。敌人要占领和摧毁的正是像桃村那样成千成百的村庄，而我们的战士牺牲流血所要保卫的也正是那些地方。战争的目的是保卫解放区，保卫解放了的一草一木，保卫自己的家庭和幸福。部队打回来的时候，刘永贵用手捧着河水，亲切地说：“今天又喝到家乡的水了。”这种形象地对于战争性质的描写，给人多么强烈的感觉啊！战争的正义性，是革命战争致胜的根本原因之一。
    从影片里，我们也看到了战争的艰苦，和从艰苦斗争中表现出来的人民军队的乐观主义。战争的确是艰苦的。天天行军转移，长途跋涉。敌人是机械化，我们是小米加步枪。爬高山峻岭，走人迹罕到的路。在战场上负伤，牺牲。人民解放军的可贵品质不是回避困难，而是设法战胜它，而是在困难面前不悲观，不低头。这是真正的乐观主义。我们只要稍微回忆一下影片中的行军场面、战斗场面（如将军庙车站争夺战），张连长、高营长负伤后的表现，战士王春炸敌坦克的种种情景，对这一点我们就会理解得更深刻。影片对这个问题是处理得很好的。它正确地表现了战争的残酷和困难，因而也正确地表现了革命的乐观主义；既没有武断地否认任何艰苦，因而也没有小资产阶级的虚伪的“乐观”情绪。
    影片在创造人物形象上也是成功的。特别对于高级干部形象的创造有成就。陈戈同志所饰演的师长，刻划出了我军经过长期斗争锻炼的高级干部最主要的特点。他忠勇、沉着，有思想，有智慧，是被马克思列宁主义的军事科学、毛泽东的军事思想武装起来了的人物。虽然这个人物生活化的程度还不够，语言还显得有些生硬；但应该说这是我们的影片在创造高级指挥员形象的尝试中比较成功的一个。
    影片中的战士、村干部（如女村长赵玉敏）等，虽然性格都还不够突出，但也都有刻划得好的地方，他们的许多优秀品质也表现出来了。张连长、赵玉敏这两个人物给人的印象是比较深刻的。
    影片描写敌人也写得较好，既没有夸张敌人的凶恶气焰，也没有把敌人写得懦弱无能，敌人也是有战争经验的，但因他们所进行的战争是反人民的，所以他们便无法获得胜利，而终于被歼灭。影片恰如其分地表现了敌人反人民的本质，和他们将领之间的勾心斗角，以及他们可耻的失败。
    影片中的语言也比较生动活泼，是从生活中提炼了的文学语言。一些八股式的语言，在这部影片中不多见了。
    “南征北战”制作的成功，证明我们完全有条件、有能力制作出思想性很高、艺术性很强的影片，只要作家、导演、演员同志们肯于作艰苦的努力。
    “南征北战”制作的成功，也进一步地证明了文学艺术工作者深入生活的重要性。沈西蒙等同志所以能写出这样好的电影剧本，和他们长期在部队生活、熟悉部队生活是分不开的；和部队领导同志的直接具体指导是分不开的。电影所以拍得很好，演员所以演得很好，和刻苦深入生活分不开，和协助演出的部队的努力及军事顾问切实负责的指导也是分不开的。（附图片）
