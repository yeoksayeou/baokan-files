    Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume I
    Miding
    According to the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the four-volume Selected Works of Mao Zedong has been published in Beijing, including the most important works of the outstanding leader of the Chinese people on all stages of the Chinese revolution and the development of the Communist Party of China. The book was prepared by a special committee established by the CPC Central Committee and reviewed by the author. Two volumes have already been published in China. Not long ago, the Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow published the Russian translation of the first volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong.
    The publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's works is of great significance not only for the Chinese Communists, but also for all communist and workers' parties who act as the vanguard of the people in the struggle for peace, people's democracy and socialism.
    Mao Zedong's works profoundly reflect the glorious activities of the heroic Chinese Communist Party, which has been organizing and guiding the Chinese people in their struggle against imperialist oppression for more than 30 years. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong is the most significant historical event after the great Russian October Socialist Revolution and the victory of the Soviet Union in World War II.
    The people's revolution led by the Communist Party of China, against foreign imperialism – primarily U.S. and British capital – feudalism, and the bureaucratic comprador big bourgeoisie, which were hostile to the interests of the Chinese people, resulted in the establishment of the regime of the working people. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution dealt a significant blow to the imperialist camp and further sharpened the general crisis of capitalism.
    The great leaders of working humanity, Lenin and Stalin, always believed that the Chinese revolution had great importance. Lenin pointed out:
    "The outcome of the struggle ultimately depends on the fact that Russia, India, China, etc., constitute the vast majority of the world's population. It is precisely this majority of the world's population that has also been very rapidly drawn into the struggle for its own liberation in recent years, so in this sense, there can be no slightest doubt about the ultimate solution to the question of the world struggle. So in this sense, the final victory of socialism is completely and absolutely guaranteed" ("Lenin's Collected Works," Russian edition, Vol. 33, p. 458. "Selected Works of Lenin" Two-Volume Collection, Chinese edition published in Moscow, Vol. II, p. 1032. – Translator's Note).
    Lenin and Stalin formulated the theory of the national colonial question, showed the revolutionary road for the peoples of the East, and described the characteristics of the development of revolutions of the peoples of the East, thus arming the communist parties of all countries with invaluable ideological weapons to defeat imperialism.
    As everyone knows, Lenin had already published a series of articles on the Chinese question in 1900, and later in 1912 and 1913. In 1918-1920, during the extremely tense period of the young Soviet Republic's life, Lenin and Stalin still paid great attention to the issues of national liberation movements and revolutionary struggles in the East. Lenin's famous theses on the national colonial question, presented to the Second Congress of the Communist International, were written at this time. This thesis deserves to be recognized as a model document because it points out the bright future for the communist parties in colonial and semi-colonial countries in the struggle for national and social liberation.
    Stalin's contribution to clarifying the issue of national liberation struggles of the peoples of the East – including the most important issue of the Chinese revolution – is particularly great. Based on a profound, scientific and comprehensive Marxist-Leninist analysis of the characteristics of China's development, Comrade Stalin gave an unparalleled explanation of the configuration and development of class forces in China, and determined the basic and decisive factors that determine the special nature of the Chinese people's revolution. These factors are: (1) China's semi-colonial status and the financial and economic rule of imperialism;
    (2) The oppression of feudal remnants, which was deepened by the oppression of warlord bureaucrats; (3) The growing revolutionary struggle of workers and peasants against the oppression of feudal officials and warlords and imperialism; (4) The political weakness of the national bourgeoisie, its dependence on imperialism, and fear of the scale of the revolutionary movement; (5) The increasing revolutionary activity of the Chinese proletariat and the growth of its prestige among the millions of working masses; and finally, (6) The existence of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the neighboring Soviet Union.
    As Comrade Stalin pointed out, all these factors determined that the nature of the Chinese revolution was a bourgeois-democratic revolution, and its characteristics were: it was at the same time an anti-imperialist national liberation revolution that aimed its blade at the rule of foreign imperialism in China.
    Comrade Stalin clarified that the characteristics of the Chinese revolution also lay in the extreme weakness of the Chinese big national bourgeoisie, and that the main lifelines of industry, railways, and banks were controlled by foreign imperialists. From this it can be seen that the initiator and leader of the revolution, the leader of the peasants, should be the Chinese proletariat and its party. With extraordinary insight, Comrade Stalin stipulated that the basic content of the Chinese bourgeois-democratic revolution was the land revolution. The merit of crushing the counter-revolutionary policy of the Trotsky-Zinoviev gang on the Chinese revolution belongs to Comrade Stalin.
    Mao Zedong, the long-tested leader of the Communist Party of China, has consistently struggled for the consolidation of the Communist Party of China and against all hidden and overt enemies of the Communist Party of China. He creatively applied the great principles of Marxism-Leninism under the conditions of the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly emphasized in his writings and speeches the paramount importance of the great October Socialist Revolution and the experience of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the international nature of Leninism, and the significance of Marxist-Leninist theory for the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. In his work "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Mao Zedong wrote: "The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped advanced elements throughout the world and also in China to use the proletarian world outlook as an instrument for observing the destiny of the country and reconsidering their own problems. Follow the path of the Russians – that was the conclusion." In his work "The Position of the Communist Party of China in the National War," Mao Zedong pointed out: "The theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are theories that are 'universally applicable'."
    Volume I includes Comrade Mao Zedong's writings from March 1926 to July 1937, covering the period of the First Domestic Revolutionary War (1924-1927) and the Second Domestic Revolutionary War (1928-1937) in China.
    These were the years of major revolutionary events in China. From 1924 to 1927, the Chinese people's national liberation struggle had an unprecedented scale. The revolution encompassed the whole country; all classes were mobilized. The Chinese working class implemented a thorough combat line and carried out a series of important political mobilizations.
    Initially, this was a revolution of a national united front, mainly against the rule of foreign imperialists in China. In this stage, in addition to workers and peasants, the national bourgeoisie also participated in the revolution. Naturally, the national bourgeoisie tried its best to use the revolution to achieve its own goals. As everyone knows, the national bourgeoisie later defected to the counter-revolutionary camp. The revolution of a national united front began to transform into a land revolution.
    More and more peasant strata stood up and engaged in the struggle for land and food, against landlords and usurers. Cruel class struggles were burning in the Chinese countryside. Due to the weakness of the Communist Party, insufficient organization of the revolutionary forces, and the betrayal of the national bourgeoisie, the Chinese revolution suffered a defeat at that time, but this defeat was temporary.
    The domestic revolutionary movement did not disappear and did not stop. The revolutionary struggle of Chinese workers and peasants was entering a new stage. The Chinese Red Army was being generated, growing, and consolidating, and many revolutionary areas that neither domestic reactionaries nor foreign imperialists could deal with were being established. The Chinese Red Army firmly established itself in some areas, successfully repelled several attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's army, and greatly supplemented its weapons by relying on them – or rather, on the foreign imperialists who generously supplied countless troops to Chiang Kai-shek.
    In October 1934, the main force of the Chinese Red Army began the great 25,000-li Long March. They transferred their base areas to the northwest region of China, striving to obtain the Soviet Union, a solid and reliable rear, and to resist the predatory intervention of Japanese imperialism, which had already begun, and its attempts to completely enslave China.
    In the struggle against the domestic and foreign enemies of the Chinese people, the Communist Party simultaneously exposed the rightist and "leftist" tendencies in its own ranks, and crushed elements who betrayed and surrendered to foreign imperialists and domestic reactionaries. Under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the Communists resolutely struggled against incorrect policies, excessive actions and errors, in order to consolidate their ranks, strengthen iron discipline and organization, and transform their party into a truly revolutionary Marxist party of the Bolshevik type.
    The most important events are reflected in Mao Zedong's works published in Volume I. The first work in Volume I, "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" (March 1926), gives a Marxist explanation and evaluation of the class forces in China, and exposes the two tendencies existing in the Communist Party of China at that time. The rightist tendency, headed by Chen Duxiu, abandoned the position of the Communist Party in front of the national bourgeoisie, only cared about cooperating with the Kuomintang, and ignored the necessity of the alliance between the proletariat and the peasants. Another tendency was represented by Zhang Guotao. This "leader" only demagogically shouted about the working class, but forgot its ally – the peasants. These two opportunistic tendencies that deviated from the correct line of the Communist Party of China were both manifestations of the spontaneous forces of the petty bourgeoisie and the pressure of lack of confidence in the internal forces of the revolution. Both tendencies denied the leadership of the proletariat in China and the significance of the alliance between the working class and the broad masses of working peasants.
    In order to accurately and clearly stipulate who are the friends of the party and who are the enemies of the party, and to unite true friends around the party – which is naturally of paramount importance – Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed the class forces in Chinese society and their political role in current events. Based on Marxist analysis, Comrade Mao Zedong determined that Chinese society at that time was composed of the following classes:
    1. The landlord class and the comprador class – this is the appendage of the international bourgeoisie in economically backward semi-colonial China. It represents the most reactionary relations of production and obstructs the development of China's productive forces in every possible way.
    2. The middle class or national bourgeoisie – it represents the capitalist relations of production in China. Comrade Mao Zedong revealed all the contradictions in the position of the national bourgeoisie. On the one hand, it also seems to oppose foreign imperialism, but on the other hand, it opposes the proletariat. It is full of doubts, fears and vacillations. On the one hand, it hopes to establish a country in which it occupies a leading position. But on the other hand, due to the complex domestic and international situation and the great struggle between revolution and counter-revolution on the world stage, it is unable to do so. For this reason, Mao Zedong showed that the intentions of the middle class "with its own class as the main body for 'independent' revolutionary thought..." (p. 5. Page numbers are noted according to the Chinese version of the People's Publishing House, the same below. – Translator's Note) have no future.
    3. The petty bourgeoisie – owner-peasants, handicraftsmen, petty intellectuals, petty clerks, petty merchants. Mao Zedong analyzed the various strata of this extremely numerous group, its contradictory position, and pointed out that some of these strata tend towards the bourgeoisie, while others tend towards the proletariat.
    4. The semi-proletariat. This includes the vast majority of semi-owner-peasants, poor peasants, small handicraftsmen, shop assistants, hawkers, etc.
    5. The proletariat – this was formed over the past twenty years and, according to Mao Zedong's estimates, numbered about two million people. These are primarily workers in the five major economic sectors of railways, mines, shipping, textiles, and shipbuilding. Mao Zedong wrote: "Although the industrial proletariat is small in number, it represents China's new productive forces, is the most progressive class in modern China, and has become the leading force in the revolutionary movement" (p. 8).
    Based on the analysis of the political positions of these class groups, Mao Zedong provided the status of the balance of power in China at that time: "The industrial proletariat is the leading force of our revolution. All semi-proletariat and petty bourgeoisie are our closest friends. The wavering middle class, its right wing may be our enemies, and its left wing may be our friends – but we must always be vigilant against them and not let them disrupt our front" (p. 9).
    We can already see in this work: with what political clarity Mao Zedong determined the role of the proletariat as the guiding force of the revolution, and emphasized that the working class must establish a firm alliance with the peasants and other non-proletarian laboring people.
    Mao Zedong firmly followed Lenin and Stalin's doctrine on the leadership of the proletariat in the bourgeois-democratic revolution, regarded the issue of proletarian leadership as the central issue, and regarded it as the decisive issue on which the development and outcome of the Chinese revolution depended. In the following works published in Volume I, Mao Zedong comprehensively elaborated on the issue of the proletariat's leadership in the bourgeois-democratic revolution, the role of the peasants as the proletariat's allies in the revolutionary struggle, and the position of the national bourgeoisie.
    "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" (March 1927) is worthy of special attention. This work carried out a resolute struggle against the opportunistic tendencies that occurred in a part of the leaders of the Communist Party of China at that time. The position of this part of the leaders may have completely disintegrated the peasant movement. Mao Zedong showed the full seriousness and importance of the Chinese peasant question.
    He emphasized: "All kinds of arguments against the peasant movement must be quickly corrected. The various erroneous treatments of the peasant movement by the revolutionary authorities must be quickly changed" (p. 13). Mao Zedong said: We must use all methods to develop the peasant movement; when hundreds of millions of peasants stand up in China, they will be like a swift storm, sweeping away all obstacles on the road to liberation, and all imperialists and their running dogs will be buried by them in the tomb.
    Mao Zedong showed how terrible the feudal patriarchal oppression was in binding the Chinese people, especially the peasants. He said: The men in the countryside are all subject to the state system of political power, the remnants of clan authority, and religious ideas, while women are also subject to the authority of their husbands in addition to these. The power of the landlord is the basis of all power in the countryside. Once the power of the landlord is overthrown, the "clan authority, divine authority, and husband authority" will also shake. Mao Zedong divided the peasants in the Chinese countryside into three strata: rich peasants, middle peasants, and poor peasants. He emphasized the role of the poor peasants as the important pillar of the proletariat and the Communist Party in the countryside.
    In the two works "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," the significant events during the First Domestic Revolutionary War in China are analyzed. Based on the Marxist analysis of the Chinese peasant movement, Mao Zedong came to the unwavering conclusion that the peasant revolution, that is, the bourgeois-democratic revolution, had matured. The outstanding proletarian revolutionary Mao Zedong spread confidence in the upcoming revolution to the hearts of millions of people, pointed out the development path of the upcoming revolution, and put forward specific political tasks for the Communist Party.
    The works included in Volume I on the period of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War in China (1928-1937) are: "Why Is It That Red Political Power Can Exist in China?" (1928); "The Struggle in Jinggang Mountains" (1928); "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" (1930); "On the Strategy of Opposing Japanese Imperialism" (1935); "Strategic Problems in China's Revolutionary War" (1936); "The Tasks of the Communist Party of China During the War of Resistance Against Japan" (1937) and others.
    In all these works, Mao Zedong observed things with a Marxist method and scientifically argued the following issues: the role of the Communist Party in the land revolution, the establishment and consolidation of revolutionary armed forces, the strategy and tactics of the Communist Party in the increasingly unfolding events, and the establishment of a national united front to fight against Japanese imperialism.
    Mao Zedong's brilliant formula on the nature of the Chinese revolution is completely based on the Marxist-Leninist policy on the question of the Chinese revolutionary struggle. Mao Zedong wrote: "China is indeed still in the stage of a bourgeois-democratic revolution. China's thorough program of democratic revolution includes overthrowing imperialism externally, seeking thorough national liberation; internally eliminating the forces of the comprador class in the cities, completing the land revolution, eliminating feudal relations in the countryside, and overthrowing the warlord government. It must go through such a democratic revolution before it can create the real basis for the transition to socialism" (p. 82).
    Mao Zedong defeated the "left" adventureists, because they demanded to immediately launch a revolution throughout the country, start an attack on the powerful and extremely consolidated enemy in the cities, and cause the party to suffer defeat. Contrary to these "left" elements and rightist elements who spread disbelief in the victory of the people, Mao Zedong formulated another plan to realize the bourgeois-democratic revolution. Starting from the growth of the land revolution and estimating the weakness of the enemy in the countryside, Mao Zedong carried out the struggle to establish rural revolutionary base areas. In the winter of 1927, at his initiative, the first revolutionary base areas were established. These base areas became extremely important revolutionary forces in the new stage of the Chinese struggle, a serious threat to Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary rule, and a great hope for the broad masses of people. Comrade Stalin emphasized as early as 1926 that in this period, in China, there was an armed revolution against an armed counter-revolution ("Stalin's Complete Works," Russian edition, Vol. 8, p. 363. "Lenin and Stalin on China," Liberation Press Chinese edition, p. 141. – Translator's Note).
    Following Mao Zedong's instructions, the Chinese Communists, in their revolutionary strategy, started from the necessity of establishing revolutionary base areas by relying on armed forces. As everyone knows, this strategy was correct and guided the Chinese revolution to national victory. Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized that such revolutionary base areas, although only occurring in small areas, have extremely important significance in Chinese life, because it makes the masses of people have strong hope for final liberation. He said: If we can preserve these sparks, it will burn into a revolutionary flame throughout China. "Only in this way can we establish the belief of the revolutionary masses throughout the country, as the Soviet Union does to the whole world. Only in this way can we give the reactionary ruling class great difficulties, shake its foundations and promote its internal disintegration. Only in this way can we truly create the Red Army and become the main tool of the future great revolution. In short, only in this way can we promote the high tide of the revolution" (p. 104).
    Mao Zedong profoundly and in detail showed why the long-term existence of the revolutionary base areas was possible at a certain stage of the revolution, and that all attempts by domestic reactionaries to eliminate it would be futile.
    In his work "Why Is It That Red Political Power Can Exist in China" (October 1928), Mao Zedong analyzed the economic backwardness of semi-colonial China, its dependence on imperialism, the war between "white regimes," and the wars of various new and old warlords, while pointing out: "...Not only is there no doubt about the long-term existence of small red areas, but these red areas will continue to develop and gradually approach the acquisition of national political power" (p. 54). He believed that the most important condition for the existence of the new revolutionary regime was the existence of a strong regular Red Army led by a powerful Communist Party.
    Mao Zedong's work "The Struggle in Jinggang Mountains" has special significance. This is a report he wrote to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on November 25, 1928. This article comprehensively examined the establishment of the Jinggang Mountain revolutionary base area on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi and the August failure suffered by this base area (1928). Mao Zedong repeatedly argued the following question: It is necessary to establish and consolidate the areas of people's political power; in countries where various hostile warlords controlled by various imperialist groups are constantly waging wars, the areas of people's political power are possible to exist.
    No matter how great the difficulties, the red base areas under the leadership of Mao Zedong had been preserved and consolidated, and the revolutionary armed forces had given major blows to the White Army that constantly tried to eliminate the red areas.
    Mao Zedong wrote: "The red flag on the border has been flying for a year... Gradually aroused the hope of the masses of workers, peasants, soldiers in the nearby provinces... The red flag on the border has never fallen, not only showing the strength of the Communist Party, but also showing the bankruptcy of the ruling class, which has great significance in national politics" (p. 86).
    Correctly estimating the role and significance of the revolutionary base areas during the period of temporary decline of the revolution, in order to preserve and consolidate forces to meet the subsequent high tide of the revolution; implementing practical leadership over the army and the entire economic life in the democratic areas; first and foremost establishing correct relations with the broad masses of peasants – this was the characteristic of the revolutionary activities of the Chinese Communists led by Mao Zedong at that time. All these aspects of the party's activities are clearly expressed in Mao Zedong's works.
    Later, when the democratic areas in China became larger and the revolutionary struggle was launched even more extensively, the issue of the economic work of these areas, the issue of organizing their economic life, became particularly important for the Communist Party. Many democratic areas existed for several years. In these areas, the landlord class had been eliminated, and new administrative and judicial organs had been established. As everyone knows, the Central People's Government led by Mao Zedong also existed at that time. Mao Zedong's works paid much attention to the activities of the Communist Party in these areas. These works include the speech "Pay Attention to Economic Work" (August 1933) and the report at the Second National Congress of Workers and Peasants held in Ruijin, Jiangxi in January 1934.
    Mao Zedong said in his report to this Congress: "The principle of our economic policy is to carry out all possible and necessary economic construction, concentrate economic forces to supply the war, and at the same time try our best to improve the lives of the people, consolidate the economic alliance between workers and peasants, guarantee the leadership of the proletariat over the peasants, strive for the leadership of the state-owned economy over the private economy, and create the prerequisites for future development into socialism" (p. 127).
    Mao Zedong used great strength to oppose the bureaucratic attitude adopted towards the needs of the masses of the people. He said: "The extremely bad guy of bureaucratic style must be thrown into the dung pit, because no comrade likes it. What every comrade should like is the mass style, that is, the style that every worker and peasant likes to accept" (pp. 120-121).
    Mao Zedong emphasized the necessity of carrying out stubborn agitation among the masses. We must persuade the masses; only under the condition that the Communists maintain constant contact with the masses can the democratic areas be consolidated and become a force that the enemy cannot break through. Mao Zedong focused the attention of the Communist Party on the need to actively engage in the struggle to save money and food, and oppose waste and corruption.
    Of particular value is Mao Zedong's work "Strategic Problems in China's Revolutionary War" (December 1936), which is an important theoretical generalization of the war experience of the two domestic revolutionary wars carried out by the Chinese Red Army. Although the author did not finish this work (he only wrote five chapters in total at that time), this work includes the most important issues of the Chinese revolutionary war in terms of content, and is a very valuable and very beneficial military book. It summarizes the sharp struggle between the two lines on military issues – the struggle carried out within the Communist Party of China. In January 1935, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China confirmed the correctness of Mao Zedong's position and rejected the erroneous views that were opposed to Mao Zedong.
    The chapter "How to Study War" has the following sections: "The Laws of War Are Developing," "The Purpose of War Is to Eliminate War," "Strategic Problems Are the Study of the Laws of the Overall Situation of War," "The Important Question Lies in Being Good at Learning." In the following chapters, Mao Zedong studied the characteristics of the Chinese revolutionary war, and studied the following issues: "Encirclement" and counter-"encirclement" as the main form of China's civil war, active defense and passive defense, and the preparation for counter-"encirclement," strategic retreat, the beginning of the counter-offensive, concentration of forces, mobile warfare and quick battles, and annihilating battles.
    In this work, Mao Zedong shows himself not only as a great military strategist and commander, but also as a military theorist who skillfully and creatively applies Lenin and Stalin's thoughts under the specific conditions of the Chinese revolutionary war. As the commander of the revolutionary war, Mao Zedong widely used the Marxist dialectical method to summarize the rich experience of the Chinese Red Army. He reveals the characteristics of the Chinese revolutionary war. He pointed out that the different war environments determine the different laws of warfare, and the laws of warfare change with the time, place and nature of the war. Mao Zedong emphasized that the history of the Russian revolution and the civil war and the experience of the Chinese revolutionary war teach us that correct political and military lines do not develop arbitrarily and peacefully, but are produced and developed in the struggle against "left" opportunism on the one hand and against right opportunism on the other.
    In the work "Strategic Problems in China's Revolutionary War," the "encirclement" of the Chinese Red Army by Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries, the victories won by the Red Army, and the Red Army's counter-"encirclement" were analyzed in detail, and the conditions of the Chinese guerrilla warfare and the basic principles of the Chinese guerrilla warfare were clarified. The author wrote: "Starting from May 1928, the basic principles of guerrilla warfare with simple nature that adapted to the situation at that time have already been produced, which are the so-called 'the enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we strike; the enemy retreats, we pursue' sixteen-character formula" (pp. 203-204). As Mao Zedong pointed out, this military principle was recognized by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China before the "left" opportunist line was produced. But later the Central Committee deviated from these principles. Great efforts were needed to make the Central Committee of the Communist Party return to the correct decision. The enlarged plenary session of the Central Committee held in Zunyi in 1935 pointed out the bankruptcy of the erroneous "left" opportunist line, and once again recognized the correctness of the previous military line – the Mao Zedong line.
    Mao Zedong pointed out in the same work that the Red Army, to a large extent, relied on its own enemies to supply weapons and ammunition; they did not yet have their own military factories and arsenals. He wrote: "Our basic policy is to rely on the military industries of imperialism and domestic enemies. We have the right to the London and Hanyang arsenals, and they are delivered through the enemy's transport teams. This is the truth, not a joke" (p. 238).
    Mao Zedong's works written in 1936-1937, the period of preparation and establishment of the anti-Japanese national united front, are of great significance to the Communist Party of China. These works are: "Statement on Chiang Kai-shek's Statement" (December 28, 1936), "The Tasks of the Communist Party of China During the War of Resistance Against Japan" (report at the National Congress of the Communist Party of China convened in Yan'an in May 1937), "Strive to Bring Millions of Masses Into the Anti-Japanese National United Front" (conclusions at the same meeting). In the above works, the main task of this period – organizing the struggle against Japanese imperialism – is comprehensively argued.
    Mao Zedong emphasized that the party's obligation is to connect the Red Army's actions with all the daily activities of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie, so as to establish an anti-Japanese national united front in China. The difference between this united front and the united front of 1924-1927 is that: now a strong and battle-hardened Communist Party is participating in the united front, and there is a strong people's revolutionary army that has accumulated rich experience in military struggle against counter-revolution.
    In May 1937, the National Congress of the Communist Party of China was convened. This congress discussed and approved the party's political line implemented under the leadership of Mao Zedong since 1935, and formulated the political and organizational strategies for further launching the War of Resistance Against Japan. Mao Zedong pointed out in his report "The Tasks of the Communist Party of China During the War of Resistance Against Japan" (which is published in Volume I): Japanese militarism is trying to completely enslave the whole of China, so the urgent task placed before the party is: to organize the domestic anti-Japanese national united front, and to establish the connection between "China's anti-Japanese national united front and the world's peace front." Guided by the principles of proletarian internationalism, Mao Zedong regarded the Chinese people's struggle as part of the overall struggle of the international proletariat, and called on China to unite with "the Soviet Union, the consistent and good friend of the Chinese people."
    The leader of the Communist Party of China particularly spoke about the need to establish a democratic order in China as the primary and necessary condition for defeating the Japanese aggressors. Mao Zedong strove to make all national forces participate in the struggle against the Japanese aggressors, and at the same time put forward the demand to establish the People's Republic of China. He emphasized that the struggle for the republic can unite all residents in the anti-Japanese national united front; only a democratic republic can help China get rid of imperialist oppression. At the same time, Mao Zedong emphasized that the responsibility of the Communist Party is to defend the united front, and it must guarantee its leadership position in this front.
    Mao Zedong gave the events at that time a Marxist-Leninist estimate, saying: "...The task of China's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal bourgeois-democratic revolution, history has determined that it cannot be completed through the leadership of the bourgeoisie, but must be completed through the leadership of the proletariat. And only by fully developing the persistence and thoroughness of the proletariat in the democratic revolution can the inherent wavering and incompleteness of the bourgeoisie be overcome, and the revolution will not be aborted. Should the proletariat follow the bourgeoisie, or should the bourgeoisie follow the proletariat? This question of the responsibility of leadership of the Chinese revolution is the key to the success or failure of the revolution. The experience from 1924 to 1927 showed how the revolution progressed when the bourgeoisie followed the political leadership of the proletariat; and how the revolution suffered defeat when the proletariat (responsible by the Communist Party) became the tail of the bourgeoisie in politics. This history should not be repeated" (p. 259).
    Mao Zedong resolutely opposed the closed-doorism, adventurism and tailism that occurred within the Communist Party of China, and warned against the narrow closed-doorism, arrogant sectarianism and adventurism tendencies existing within the party. These harmful tendencies hindered the party from establishing the anti-Japanese united front and winning over the majority of the people. Mao Zedong ended his report with the following words: "In order to achieve the goal of overcoming the above-mentioned bad tendencies, it is absolutely necessary to improve the theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism in the whole party, because only this theory is the compass that guides the Chinese revolution to victory" (p. 261).
    Under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communists, under the difficult conditions of reactionary terror and rule, held high the banner of revolution and led the masses to fight for the People's Republic, for freedom and land. The Chinese Communist Party has won the love and trust of the people and has grown into a mass, militant Marxist party of the Chinese proletariat. It has led the Chinese people to the victory of the revolution, and is now successfully leading the construction of the new China.
    The last work in the first volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong is the philosophical work "On Practice. On the Relationship Between Knowledge and Practice – The Relationship Between Knowing and Doing" (July 1937), which is known to Soviet readers. In this work, Comrade Mao Zedong, from the standpoint of Marxist philosophy, exposes the subjective mistakes of dogmatists and empiricists, which at that time had brought serious harm to the cause of the development of the Chinese revolution.
    In the work "On Practice," the materialist epistemology, that is, the theory of reflection, is briefly outlined in a vivid and figurative form. Mao Zedong pointed out that the epistemology of dialectical materialism, in contrast to the materialism before Marxism, emphasizes the decisive role of practice in cognition. When talking about the role of practice in cognition, Mao Zedong pointed out that only social practice is the criterion for the truthfulness of people's cognition of nature and society. Truth can only be determined by objective social practice. Mao Zedong opposes various tendencies to disconnect theory from practice, and opposes destroying the unity of theory and practice.
    Mao Zedong explained two characteristics of dialectical materialism: "Marxist philosophy, dialectical materialism, has two most prominent characteristics: one is its class nature, openly declaring that dialectical materialism serves the proletariat; and the other is its practical nature, emphasizing the dependence of theory on practice, the foundation of theory is practice, and it in turn serves practice" (p. 283).
    Secondly, Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed the two stages of the cognitive process in his own work: he called the first stage the perceptual stage of cognition; he called rational, logical cognition the second stage. The author regards the transition from the first stage of cognition to the second stage as a transition from simple to complex.
    Mao Zedong pointed out that all true knowledge starts from experience. Experience consists of two parts, namely personal direct experience and indirect experience. When citing many obvious and interesting examples to illustrate complex theoretical principles, the author used great scientific power to show the untenable nature of idealist epistemology. In his own work, starting from Lenin and Stalin's instructions, Mao Zedong repeatedly emphasized the active role of cognition, regarded revolutionary theory as a guide to action, and pointed out the increasing significance of theory for the Communist Party's practical activities.
    The last paragraph discusses the principles of Marxism-Leninism on absolute truth and relative truth, and on the unity of the objective and subjective in cognition. Mao Zedong made a brief summary, writing: "Discover the truth through practice, and then confirm the truth and develop the truth through practice." He also said: "Practice, knowledge, re-practice, re-knowledge, this form circulates back and forth to infinity, and the content of each cycle of practice and knowledge has progressed to a higher level. This is the entire epistemology of dialectical materialism, this is the dialectical materialist view of the unity of knowledge and action" (pp. 295-29

    毛泽东选集第一卷
    米丁
    根据中国共产党中央委员会的决定，在北京出版了四卷本的毛泽东选集，其中包括杰出的中国人民领袖关于中国革命和中国共产党各个发展时期的一切最重要著作。该书是经中共中央特设委员会准备和著者审查过的。在中国已经有两卷出版了。不久以前，莫斯科外国文书籍出版局出版了毛泽东选集第一卷的俄文译本。
    毛泽东同志著作的出版，不仅对于中国共产党人，而且对于在争取和平、争取人民民主和社会主义的斗争中作为人民前卫的一切共产党和工人党，都具有巨大的意义。
    在毛泽东的著作中，深刻地反映了三十多年来都在组织和指导中国人民反对帝国主义压迫的英勇斗争的光荣的中国共产党的活动。中国人民革命在中国共产党人及其领袖毛泽东的领导下赢得了胜利，这个胜利是伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命和苏联在第二次世界大战中的胜利之后的最重大的历史事件。
    中国共产党所领导的人民革命，反对敌视中国人民利益的外国帝国主义——首先是美、英的资本，——中国的封建主义和官僚买办大资产阶级，结果建立了劳动人民的政权。中国人民革命的胜利给予了帝国主义阵营以重大的打击，并使资本主义总危机更加尖锐化了。
    劳动人类的伟大领袖列宁和斯大林始终认为中国革命具有巨大的意义。列宁指出：
    “斗争的结局，归根到底是取决于俄国、印度、中国等等构成世界人口绝大多数的这种情形。正是这世界人口底大多数，最近几年来也非常迅速地卷入谋自身解放的斗争，所以在这个意义上讲来，关于世界斗争问题底最终解决，不能有丝毫的怀疑。所以在这个意义上讲来，社会主义底最后胜利是完全和绝对有了保证的”（“列宁全集”，俄文版，第三三卷，第四五八页。“列宁文选”两卷集，莫斯科中文版，第二卷，第一○三二页。——译者注）。
    列宁和斯大林制定了民族殖民地问题的理论，展示了东方各国人民革命的道路，并描述了东方各国人民革命发展的特点，这样就以战胜帝国主义的不可估价的思想武器来武装了各国的共产党。
    大家知道，列宁还在一九○○年，以后在一九一二年和一九一三年，就已经发表了一系列关于中国问题的论文。在一九一八——一九二○年，即在年青的苏维埃共和国生活极端紧张的时期，列宁和斯大林对于东方民族解放运动和革命斗争的问题仍然给予很大的注意。列宁向共产国际第二次代表大会提出的关于民族殖民地问题的著名提纲，就是在这个时候写的。这个提纲不愧被公认为典范的文件，因为它给殖民地半殖民地国家的共产党指出了争取民族解放和社会解放的斗争的光明前途。
    斯大林在阐明东方各族人民的民族解放斗争问题——其中包括中国革命最重要的问题——方面所作的贡献，是特别伟大的。斯大林同志根据对于中国发展特点的深刻的科学的全面的马克思列宁主义的分析，给予了中国阶级力量的配置和发展以无可伦比的说明，确定了决定中国人民革命特殊性质的基本的和决定性的因素。这些因素是：（一）中国的半殖民地地位和帝国主义的财政经济统治；
    （二）为军阀官僚的压迫所加深的封建残余的压迫；（三）工人和农民反对封建官吏压迫、反对军阀和帝国主义的日益增长的革命斗争；（四）民族资产阶级在政治上的软弱，它对于帝国主义的依赖，它对于革命运动规模的恐惧；（五）中国无产阶级的日益增长的革命积极性、它在千百万劳动群众中间的威信的增长；最后，（六）无产阶级专政在中国邻邦苏联的存在。
    正如斯大林同志所指出，这一切因素决定了中国革命的性质是资产阶级民主革命，而它的特点是：它同时是把刀锋指向外国帝国主义在中国的统治的反帝的民族解放革命。
    斯大林同志阐明了中国革命的特点也在于：中国大民族资产阶级极端薄弱，工业、铁路、银行的主要命脉都掌握在外国帝国主义者手中。由此可见，革命的首倡者和领导者、农民的领袖，应当是中国无产阶级及其政党。斯大林同志以异常的洞察力规定了中国资产阶级民主革命的基本内容是土地革命。粉碎了托洛茨基—季诺维也夫匪帮关于中国革命问题的反革命方针的功绩，正是属于斯大林同志。
    中国共产党久经考验的领袖毛泽东，始终一贯地为中国共产党的巩固、为反对中国共产党的一切隐藏的和公开的敌人而斗争，他在中国革命的条件下，创造性地应用了马克思列宁主义的伟大原则。毛泽东同志在自己的著作和演说中经常强调伟大的十月社会主义革命和联共（布）经验的头等重要意义、列宁主义底国际性质、马克思列宁主义理论对于中国人民革命斗争的意义。在“论人民民主专政”这一著作中，毛泽东写道：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论”。毛泽东在“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”这一著作中指出：“马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，是‘放之四海而皆准’的理论”。
    第一卷包括毛泽东同志在一九二六年三月到一九三七年七月所写的关于中国第一次国内革命战争时期（一九二四——一九二七年）和第二次国内革命战争时期（一九二八——一九三七年）的著作。
    这是中国发生大革命事变的年份。一九二四——一九二七年，中国人民的民族解放斗争具有着空前未有的规模。革命囊括了全国；一切阶级都动起来了。中国工人阶级实行了彻底的战斗路线，进行了一系列重要的政治发动。
    最初，这是一个全民的统一战线的革命，主要是反对外国帝国主义者在中国的统治。在这一阶段中，除工人和农民外，还有民族资产阶级参加革命。自然，民族资产阶级是竭力想利用革命来达到自己目的的。大家知道，往后民族资产阶级便投到反革命阵营去了。全民的统一战线的革命开始转变为土地革命。
    人数愈来愈多的农民阶层都站起身来，从事争取土地和粮食、反对地主和高利贷者的斗争。中国乡村里燃烧着残酷的阶级斗争。由于共产党的薄弱、革命力量的组织性不够和民族资产阶级的叛变，中国革命当时便遭受了失败，但这失败是暂时的。
    国内的革命运动并没有消灭，并没有停止。中国工人和农民的革命斗争正进入新的阶段。中国红军正产生、成长和巩固起来，许多无论国内反动派或外国帝国主义者都无法对付的革命区域正创立起来。中国红军在一些地区里稳固地站住了脚，顺利地打退蒋介石军队的几次进攻，并且靠他们——更确切些说，靠慷慨给蒋介石无数军队以供应的外国帝国主义者——来大大地补充了自己的武器。
    一九三四年十月，中国红军的主力开始了伟大的二万五千里长征。他们把根据地转移到中国的西北地区，力求获得苏联这个巩固可靠的后方，并且抵抗日本帝国主义已经开始的掠夺性干涉、它的完全奴役中国的企图。
    共产党在与中国人民的国内外敌人作斗争中，同时揭破了自己队伍中的右倾和“左”倾，粉碎了向外国帝国主义者和国内反动派叛变投降的分子。在毛泽东领导下，共产党人反对不正确的方针、过火行动和错误，毅然为巩固自己队伍、加强铁的纪律和组织、把自己的党改变为布尔什维克式的真正革命的马克思主义政党而斗争。
    在刊载于第一卷的毛泽东著作中，反映了这一切最重要的事件。第一卷的第一篇著作“中国社会各阶级的分析”（一九二六年三月），给予中国各阶级力量以马克思主义的说明和估价，并揭破当时存在于中国共产党内的两种倾向。以陈独秀为首的右倾，在民族资产阶级面前放弃了共产党的立场，只关心跟国民党合作，忽视了无产阶级与农民联盟的必要性问题。另一种倾向是以张国焘为代表。这位“领袖”只是煽惑地叫喊工人阶级，却忘记了它的同盟者——农民。这两种离开中国共产党正确路线的机会主义倾向，都是小资产阶级的自发势力和对革命内部力量缺乏信心的压力的表现。这两种倾向都否认无产阶级在中国的领导权和工人阶级与广大劳动农民群众联盟的意义。
    为了确切和明白地规定谁是党的朋友和谁是党的敌人，以及团结真正朋友在党的周围——这自然是具有头等重要意义的，——毛泽东同志分析了中国社会的各阶级力量、它们在当前事变中的政治作用。毛泽东同志根据马克思主义的分析，确定了当时中国社会是由下列各阶级所构成：
    一、地主阶级和买办阶级——这是在经济落后的半殖民地的中国的国际资产阶级的附庸，它代表最反动的生产关系，并且百般阻碍中国生产力的发展。
    二、中产阶级或民族资产阶级——它代表中国资本主义的生产关系。毛泽东同志揭露了民族资产阶级立场的全部矛盾性。一方面，它似乎也反对外国帝国主义，但另一方面，它却反对无产阶级。它充满怀疑、恐惧和动摇。一方面，它希望建立自己占领导地位的国家。但另一方面，由于国内和国际复杂的局面，由于世界舞台上所进行的革命和反革命间的巨大斗争，它又不能够做到这点。因为这个缘故，毛泽东表明：“以其本阶级为主体的‘独立’革命思想……”（第五页。页数系按人民出版社中文版注明，以下仿此。——译者注）的中产阶级的意向，是没有前途的。
    三、小资产阶级——自耕农、手工业主、小知识阶层、小员司、小商人。毛泽东分析这人数极为众多的集团的各个阶层、它的矛盾地位，指出这些阶层的一部分是倾向于资产阶级，而另一部分则倾向于无产阶级。
    四、半无产阶级。这包含着绝大部分半自耕农、贫农、小手工业者、店员、小贩等等。
    五、无产阶级——这是二十年来形成的，根据毛泽东的估计，约有二百万人。这首先是铁路、矿山、海运、纺织、造船五个主要经济部门中的工人。毛泽东写道：“工业无产阶级人数虽不多，却是中国新的生产力的代表者，是近代中国最进步的阶级，做了革命运动的领导力量”（第八页）。
    毛泽东根据对这些阶级集团的政治立场的分析，提供了当时中国各种力量对比的状况：“工业无产阶级是我们革命的领导力量。一切半无产阶级、小资产阶级，是我们最接近的朋友。那动摇不定的中产阶级，其右翼可能是我们的敌人，其左翼可能是我们的朋友——但我们要时常提防他们，不要让他们扰乱了我们的阵线”（第九页）。
    我们在这一著作中就已经看到：毛泽东是以怎样的政治的明确性来确定无产阶级之作为革命指导力量的作用，并且着重指出工人阶级之必须跟农民和其他非无产阶级的劳动人民阶层建立牢固的联盟。
    毛泽东坚定地遵循着列宁和斯大林关于无产阶级在资产阶级民主革命中的领导权的学说，把无产阶级的领导作用问题看作中心问题，看作中国革命的发展和结局以之为转移的决定性问题。在第一卷刊印的紧跟着的一些著作中，毛泽东全面地阐明了无产阶级在资产阶级民主革命中的领导权问题，农民之作为无产阶级在革命斗争中的同盟者的作用问题，民族资产阶级的立场问题。
    “湖南农民运动考察报告”（一九二七年三月）是值得特别注意的。这一著作曾对当时中国共产党一部分领导人中所发生的机会主义倾向进行了坚决的斗争。这一部分领导人的立场可能使农民运动完全瓦解。毛泽东表明了中国农民问题的全部严重性和重要性。
    他强调地说：“所有各种反对农民运动的议论，都必须迅速矫正。革命当局对农民运动的各种错误处置，必须迅速变更”（第一三页）。毛泽东说：必须用一切方法来展开农民运动；当几万万农民在中国站起来了，他们将如迅猛的暴风，扫清道路上的一切障碍而走向解放，一切帝国主义及其走狗都将被他们葬入坟墓。
    毛泽东表明：多么可怕的封建家长制的压迫在束缚着中国人民、特别是农民。他说：乡村中的男子都受国家系统的政权、族权残余、宗教观念的支配，而妇女则除此以外还要受夫权的支配。地主权力是乡村中一切权力的基干。地主权力既被打翻，“族权、神权、夫权”便跟着动摇起来。毛泽东把中国乡村的农民划分为三个阶层：富农、中农、贫农。他强调贫农之作为无产阶级和共产党在乡村中的重要支柱的作用。
    在“中国社会各阶级的分析”和“湖南农民运动考察报告”两篇著作中，分析了中国第一次国内革命战争时期的意义重大的事件。根据对中国农民运动的马克思主义的分析，毛泽东得出农民革命即资产阶级民主革命已经成熟的这个确定不移的结论。杰出的无产阶级革命家毛泽东把对于行将到来的革命的信心传播到千百万人的心里去，指出行将到来的革命的发展道路，在共产党面前提出具体的政治任务。
    编入第一卷的关于中国第二次国内革命战争时期（一九二八——一九三七年）的著作是：“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？”（一九二八年）；“井冈山的斗争”（一九二八年）；“星星之火，可以燎原”（一九三○年）；“论反对日本帝国主义的策略”（一九三五年）；“中国革命战争的战略问题”（一九三六年）；“中国共产党在抗日时期的任务”（一九三七年）及其他。
    在这一切著作中，毛泽东以马克思主义的方法观察事物，科学地论证下列问题：共产党在土地革命中的作用，建立和巩固革命武装力量，共产党在日益展开的事变中的战略和策略，建立为反对日本帝国主义而斗争的民族统一战线。
    毛泽东的关于中国革命性质的卓越的公式，完完全全是根据马克思列宁主义关于中国革命斗争问题的方针的。毛泽东写道：“中国现时确实还是处在资产阶级民权革命的阶段。中国澈底的民权主义革命的纲领，包括对外推翻帝国主义，求得澈底的民族解放；对内肃清买办阶级的在城市的势力，完成土地革命，消灭乡村的封建关系，推翻军阀政府。必定要经过这样的民权主义革命，方能造成过渡到社会主义的真正基础”（第八二页）。
    毛泽东击破了“左”倾冒险主义者，因为他们要求立刻在全国展开革命，开始向城市中的强大的极其巩固的敌人进攻，使党遭受失败。跟这些“左”倾分子以及散播对人民胜利无信心的右倾分子相反，毛泽东制定了实现资产阶级民主革命的另一计划。毛泽东从土地革命的增长出发，估计到敌人在乡村中的软弱无力，进行了建立农村革命根据地的斗争。一九二七年冬天，由于他的首倡，建立了第一批革命根据地。这些根据地在中国斗争的新阶段上成为极重要的革命力量，对蒋介石反革命统治的严重威胁，广大人民群众的极大的希望。斯大林同志还在一九二六年就着重指出：在这个时期，在中国是武装的革命反对武装的反革命（“斯大林全集”，俄文版，第八卷，第三六三页。“列宁斯大林论中国”，解放社中文版，第一四一页。——译者注）。
    中国共产党人遵循毛泽东的指示，在自己的革命战略中，是从凭借武装力量建立革命根据地的这个必要性出发。大家知道，这个战略是正确的，它引导中国革命到全国的胜利。毛泽东同志着重指出：这样的革命根据地，虽然只是在小块的地方发生，但在中国生活中却有极重大的意义，因为它使人民群众对最后解放产生坚强的希望。他说：如果我们保存得住这些星星之火，它就会燃烧成为遍及全中国的革命火焰。“必须这样，才能树立全国革命群众的信仰，如苏联之于全世界然。必须这样，才能给反动统治阶级以甚大的困难，动摇其基础而促进其内部的分解。也必须这样，才能真正地创造红军，成为将来大革命的主要工具。总而言之，必须这样，才能促进革命的高潮”（第一○四页）。
    毛泽东深刻地和详细地表明：为什么在革命的一定阶段革命根据地之长期存在成为可能，而国内反动派之想消灭它的一切企图都会徒劳无功。
    毛泽东在“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在”（一九二八年十月）这一著作中分析了半殖民地中国的经济落后、它对于帝国主义的依赖、“白色政权之间”的战争、各派新旧军阀的战争，同时指出道：“……不但小块红色区域的长期存在没有疑义，而且这些红色区域将继续发展，日渐接近于全国政权的取得”（第五四页）。他认为新的革命政权存在的最重要条件，是强有力的共产党所领导的强有力的正规红军之存在。
    毛泽东的“井冈山的斗争”这一著作具有着特殊的意义。这是他在一九二八年十一月二十五日写给中国共产党中央委员会的一篇报告。这篇文章对于湘赣边界井冈山革命根据地的建立以及这根据地所遭受的八月失败（一九二八年）问题进行了全面的考察。毛泽东一再论证如下的问题：必须建立和巩固人民政权的区域；在各个帝国主义集团所控制的各派敌对的军阀进行着不断的战争的国家，人民政权的区域是有存在的可能的。
    不管有多大的困难，红色根据地在毛泽东的领导下曾经保存和巩固了，革命的武装部队给予了经常企图消灭红色区域的白军以重大的打击。
    毛泽东写道：“边界的红旗子，业已打了一年，……渐渐引起了附近省份工农士兵群众的希望。……边界红旗子始终不倒，不但表示了共产党的力量，而且表示了统治阶级的破产，在全国政治上有重大的意义”（第八六页）。
    正确估计革命根据地在革命暂时低落时期的作用和意义，以便保存和巩固力量来迎接以后革命的高涨；在民主区域内对军队和全部经济生活实行实际的领导；首先和广大农民群众建立正确的关系，——这就是当时以毛泽东为首的中国共产党人的革命活动的特征。在毛泽东的著作中明晰地表现了党的活动的这一切方面。
    往后，当中国的民主区域变得更大，革命斗争展开得还更广泛的时候，这些区域的经济工作问题，它们的经济生活组织问题，对于共产党便具有特别的重要性。许多民主区域存在了几年。在这些区域里已经消灭了地主阶级，建立了新的行政机关和司法机关。大家知道，当时还存在着毛泽东所领导的中央人民政府。在毛泽东的著作中很注意共产党在这些区域里的活动。这些著作有“必须注意经济工作”（一九三三年八月）这一演说和一九三四年一月在江西瑞金召集的第二次全国工农代表大会上的报告。
    毛泽东在这次代表大会的报告里说：“我们的经济政策的原则，是进行一切可能的和必须的经济方面的建设，集中经济力量供给战争，同时极力改良民众的生活，巩固工农在经济方面的联合，保证无产阶级对于农民的领导，争取国营经济对私人经济的领导，造成将来发展到社会主义的前提”（第一二七页）。
    毛泽东用很大力量反对对人民群众的需要所采取的官僚主义态度。他说：“要把官僚主义方式这个极坏的家伙抛到粪缸里去，因为没有一个同志喜欢它。每一个同志喜欢的应该是群众化的方式，即是每一个工人、农民所喜欢接受的方式”（第一二○——一二一页）。
    毛泽东强调在群众中进行顽强鼓动的必要性。必须说服群众；只有在共产党员跟群众保持不断联系的条件下，民主区域才会巩固起来，并成为敌人无法攻破的力量。毛泽东把共产党的注意力集中到必须积极从事节省钱财和粮食、反对浪费和贪污的斗争这方面去。
    格外有价值的是毛泽东的“中国革命战争的战略问题”（一九三六年十二月）这一著作，它是对中国红军所进行的两次国内革命战争的战争经验作了重要的理论概括。虽然作者不曾写完这一著作（他当时总共只写了五章），但是这一著作就内容讲来却包括中国革命战争的最重要问题，是一本非常有价值和非常有益的军事书籍。它给军事问题上两条路线的尖锐斗争——在中国共产党内部进行的斗争——做出了总结。一九三五年一月，中国共产党中央委员会确认了毛泽东立场的正确性，并摈斥了和毛泽东对立的错误观点。
    “如何研究战争”这一章有下列各节：“战争规律是发展的”、“战争的目的在于消灭战争”、“战略问题是研究战争全局的规律的东西”、“重要的问题在善于学习”。毛泽东在跟着的各章中研究中国革命战争的特点，研究下列各个问题：作为中国内战主要形式的“围剿”和反“围剿”，积极防御和消极防御以及反“围剿”的准备，战略退却，反攻的开始，集中兵力，运动战和速决战，歼灭战。
    在这一著作中，毛泽东表现自己不仅是大军事家和大指挥员，而且是在中国革命战争具体条件下巧妙地和创造性地应用列宁斯大林思想的军事理论家。作为革命战争的统帅，毛泽东广泛地运用马克思主义辩证方法来概括中国红军的丰富经验。他揭示中国革命战争的特点。他指出：战争环境的不同决定着作战规律的不同，作战规律是随着战争的时间、地点和性质而变化的。毛泽东强调俄国革命和国内战争的历史以及中国革命战争的经验是这样教导我们：正确的政治路线和军事路线不是随意地与和平地发展的，而是在一方面反对“左”倾机会主义和另一方面反对右倾机会主义的斗争当中产生和发展的。
    在“中国革命战争的战略问题”这一著作中，详细分析了蒋介石反动派对中国红军的“围剿”、红军所获得的胜利、红军的反“围剿”，阐明了中国游击战争的条件、中国游击战争的基本原则。著者写道：“从一九二八年五月开始，适应当时情况的带着朴素性质的游击战争基本原则，已经产生出来了，那就是所谓‘敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追’的十六字诀”（第二○三——二○四页）。正如毛泽东所指出，这个军事原则在“左”倾机会主义路线产生以前是中国共产党中央所承认了的。但是后来中央却离开了这些原则。需要很大的努力才能使共产党中央再回到正确的决定。一九三五年在遵义召开的中央扩大全会，指出错误的“左”倾机会主义路线的破产，再又承认以前军事路线——毛泽东路线的正确性。
    毛泽东在同一著作中指出：红军在颇大的程度内是靠自己的敌人供应了武器弹药的；他们还没有自己的军火工厂和军火库。他写道：“我们的基本方针是依赖帝国主义和国内敌人的军事工业。伦敦和汉阳的兵工厂，我们是有权利的，并且经过敌人的运输队送来。这是真理，并不是笑话”（第二三八页）。
    毛泽东在一九三六——一九三七年、即准备和建立抗日民族统一战线的时期所写的著作，对于中国共产党具有着莫大的意义，这些著作是：“关于蒋介石声明的声明”（一九三六年十二月二十八日），“中国共产党在抗日时期的任务”（一九三七年五月在延安召集的中国共产党全国代表会议上的报告），“为争取千百万群众进入抗日民族统一战线而斗争”（在同一会议上的结论）。在上述的著作中，全面地论证了这一时期的主要任务——组织反对日本帝国主义斗争。
    毛泽东着重指出：党的义务是在于把红军的行动同工人、农民、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级的全部日常活动联系起来，以便在中国建立抗日民族统一战线。这一统一战线跟一九二四——一九二七年的统一战线不同的地方是在于：现在统一战线里有着强有力的和受过战斗锻炼的共产党参加，有着积累了反对反革命的军事斗争丰富经验的强大的人民革命军队存在。
        一九三七年五月，召开了中国共产党全国代表会议。这个代表会议讨论和赞同了自一九三五年以来在毛泽东领导下所实行的党的政治路线，并制定了进一步展开抗日战争的政治和组织的方策。毛泽东在代表会议上所作的报告“中国共产党在抗日时期的任务”中指出（这是刊印于第一卷中的）：日本军国主义力图完全奴役全中国，因此摆在党面前的紧急任务就是：组织国内的抗日民族统一战线，并且建立“中国的抗日民族统一战线和世界的和平阵线”的联系。毛泽东以无产阶级的国际主义原则为指南，把中国人民的斗争看作国际无产阶级总的斗争的一部分，号召中国与“中国人民的始终一贯的良友苏联”联合起来。
    中国共产党领袖特别讲到必须在中国建立民主秩序作为战胜日本侵略者的首要的和必要的条件。毛泽东力求使一切民族力量参加反对日本侵略者的斗争，同时提出建立中华人民共和国的要求。他着重指出：为共和国的斗争能把一切居民阶层团结在抗日民族统一战线中；只有民主共和国才能帮助中国摆脱帝国主义的压迫。同时，毛泽东着重指出：共产党的责任是在于保卫统一战线，并且必须保证自己在这一战线上的领导地位。
    毛泽东给予当时的事件以马克思列宁主义的估计，他说：“……中国反帝反封建的资产阶级民主革命的任务，历史已判定不能经过资产阶级的领导，而必须经过无产阶级的领导，才能够完成。并且只有充分发扬无产阶级在民主革命中的坚持性和澈底性，才能克服资产阶级的那种先天的动摇性和不澈底性，而使革命不至于流产。使无产阶级跟随资产阶级呢，还是使资产阶级跟随无产阶级呢？这个中国革命领导责任的问题，乃是革命成败的关键。一九二四年至一九二七年的经验，表明了当资产阶级追随着无产阶级的政治领导的时候，革命是如何地前进了；及至无产阶级（由共产党负责）在政治上变成了资产阶级的尾巴的时候，革命又是如何地遭到了失败。这种历史不应当重复了”（第二五九页）。
    毛泽东坚决地反对中国共产党内所发生的关门主义、冒险主义和尾巴主义，警告提防党内所存在的狭隘的关门主义、傲慢的宗派主义和冒险主义的倾向。这些有害的倾向妨碍了党建立抗日统一战线和争取大多数人民。毛泽东用下面的话来结束自己的报告：“为了达到克服上述这些不良倾向的目的，在全党中提高马克思列宁主义的理论水平是完全必要的，因为只有这种理论，才是引导中国革命走向胜利的指南针”（第二六一页）。
    中国共产党人在毛泽东的领导下，在反动的恐怖和统治的困难条件下，高高举起革命的旗帜，领导群众为人民共和国、为自由和土地而斗争。中国共产党取得了人民的爱戴和信任，已成长为中国无产阶级的群众性的、战斗的马克思主义政党了。它已引导中国人民到革命的胜利，而现在正成功地领导新中国的建设。
    毛泽东选集第一卷的最后一篇著作，是苏联读者所知道的哲学著作“实践论。论认识和实践的关系——知和行的关系”（一九三七年七月）。在这一著作中，毛泽东同志从马克思主义哲学的立场揭穿教条主义者和经验主义者的主观主义错误，这种错误在当时曾给中国革命发展的事业带来了严重的危害。
    在“实践论”这一著作中，以鲜明的和形象化的形式，简洁地概述了唯物论的认识论即反映论。毛泽东指出：辩证唯物论的认识论与马克思主义以前的唯物论相反，强调实践对于认识的决定作用。在谈到实践对于认识的作用时，毛泽东指出：只有社会实践，才是人们对于自然和社会的认识的真理性的标准。真理只能由客观的社会实践来决定。毛泽东反对使理论和实践脱节的各种倾向，反对破坏理论和实践的统一。
    毛泽东说明辩证唯物论的两个特点：“马克思主义的哲学辩证唯物论有两个最显著的特点：一个是它的阶级性，公然申明辩证唯物论是为无产阶级服务的；再一个是它的实践性，强调理论对于实践的依赖关系，理论的基础是实践，又转过来为实践服务”（第二八三页）。
    其次，毛泽东同志在自己著作中分析认识过程的两个阶段：他称第一阶段为认识的感性阶段；他把理性的、论理的认识叫作第二阶段。著者把由认识的第一阶段到第二阶段的过渡看作由简至繁的过渡。
    毛泽东指出：一切真知都是从经验出发。经验由两部分组成，即亲身直接的经验和间接的经验。在引用许多明显的和有趣的例子来说明复杂的理论原理时，著者用巨大的科学力量表明唯心论认识论的站不住。毛泽东在自己著作中，从列宁斯大林的指示出发，屡次强调认识的积极作用，把革命理论看作行动的指南，指出理论对于共产党的实际活动的日益增长的意义。
    最末的一段是论述马克思列宁主义关于绝对真理和相对真理、关于认识中客观和主观的统一的原理。毛泽东做出简要的总结，写道：“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理和发展真理”。又说：“实践、认识、再实践、再认识，这种形式，循环往复以至无穷，而实践和认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度。这就是辩证唯物论的全部认识论，这就是辩证唯物论的知行统一观”（第二九五——二九六页）。无疑地，毛泽东同志这一哲学著作帮助了用马克思列宁主义的哲学原则来教育中国共产党人。
    中国革命的历史意义是伟大的。它的灵魂和组织者就是光荣的中国共产党。党和它的久经考验的领袖毛泽东的力量，就在于马克思列宁主义理论的正确性。
    毛泽东选集第一卷所包括的著作，是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林理论的伟大和不可战胜之新证明。各国共产党和工人党、争取和平的斗士，都将以最大的兴趣来研究中国共产党领袖毛泽东同志的著作，并且将再度深信：马克思列宁主义理论是永远光辉的力量，胜利的历史进程是不可违反的，和平、民主、社会主义事业的最后胜利是无法避免的。
