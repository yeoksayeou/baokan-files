Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 9th: The "Mongolia-China Friendship Fortnight," held in the Mongolian People's Republic to further strengthen and develop friendly cooperation between Mongolia and China, is being enthusiastically launched throughout the country. People from all walks of life in Mongolia are widely participating in various activities of the Friendship Fortnight with high political enthusiasm.

    The capital of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, solemnly held the opening ceremony of the "Mongolia-China Friendship Fortnight" on September 30th. On October 1st, grand gatherings were held in the Mongolian capital, the capitals of all eighteen provinces, all soums (counties), government offices, factories, schools, and mass organizations to celebrate the opening of the "Mongolia-China Friendship Fortnight" and the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. From the Central Aimak (province) to the Baga (district), from factories and schools to the yurts inhabited by herders, the national flags of China and Mongolia were flying everywhere, like a festival. Ulaanbaatar and the provincial capitals also held photo exhibitions and film exhibitions of the New China. Ulaanbaatar newspapers and provincial local newspapers published editorials and continuously published articles and photos introducing the construction achievements of the New China with great length. The Central Radio Station has two hours of radio programs every day introducing the New China. These programs start with Chinese songs in the early morning and include articles introducing the economic, scientific, cultural, and educational development of China, model deeds of Chinese advanced workers, and recitations of Chinese novels and poems.

    Workers in various factories and enterprises in Mongolia launched a "Mongolia-China Friendship Fortnight" socialist emulation movement, using the achievements of over-fulfilling production tasks as a gift to the Friendship Fortnight. The workers of the Stalin Meat Packing Plant invested in intense production competition in the week before the opening of the Friendship Fortnight, and each workshop formulated specific plans. An old worker and representative of the Great People's Hural, Gentondorji, planned to complete 250 percent of the sausage production task in the ten days of the Friendship Fortnight. Wanqin, a shock worker in the waste utilization workshop, overfulfilled the production task by five times on the first day of the Friendship Fortnight. Workers in the 14th mine of the Nalaikh Coal Mine completed ten days of production tasks in seven days to welcome the Friendship Fortnight. The slogan put forward by the workers was: "Pay tribute to the great neighboring Chinese people with the achievements of labor emulation."

    From October 1st, factories, schools, government offices, and organizations across Mongolia have evening parties every day. They held various thematic seminars and reports, enthusiastically discussing the significance of economic, political, and cultural cooperation between Mongolia and China, and introduced the development of New China and the achievements in various aspects of construction. The teachers and students of the National Choibalsan University specially arranged an exhibition introducing the New China and Mao Zedong's works, published wall newspaper special issues, and held music evenings. The whole school also organized a Mao Zedong Thought research group and made three special reports on the New China issue. The Sukhbaatar Senior Party School, the Teachers College, and the Trade College also invited Mongolian representatives who had been to China to give reports at the schools. On October 5th, the Ulaanbaatar skating rink also held a sports meeting.

    The Chinese Industrial Exhibition, which officially opened in Ulaanbaatar on October 1st, is attracting thousands upon thousands of visitors, and the number of visitors is increasing every day. On October 5th alone, the number of visitors to the first pavilion reached more than 16,000. There were more than 13,000 visitors to the second pavilion. Within five days, the number of visitors has exceeded half of the population of Ulaanbaatar. Some herders even rode camels for four days to get to Ulaanbaatar to visit.

    The Chinese Song and Dance Troupe held fourteen performances at the Mongolian National Theatre and various factories, schools, and government offices for several consecutive days. Cinemas are showing Chinese films, and the Mongolian National Theatre is performing the famous Chinese play "The White Haired Girl." Mongolian actors sang many Chinese songs and performed Chinese dances. All cinemas and theaters are crowded every day.

    In the provincial capitals of South Hangai Province, Uvs Province, Bulgan Province, and Gobi-Altai Province, workers and herders are visiting the photo exhibition of New China with great interest. More than 1,000 people visited the photo exhibition in Gobi-Altai Province on October 2nd alone. More than 2,000 people attended the lecture introducing New China held in Bulgan Province.

    【新华社乌兰巴托九日电】蒙古人民共和国为进一步加强与发展蒙中两国的友好合作而举办的“蒙中友好旬”，正在蒙古人民共和国全国热烈展开。蒙古各阶层人民都以高涨的政治热情广泛地参加了友好旬的各种活动。
    蒙古首都乌兰巴托在九月三十日隆重地举行了“蒙中友好旬”的开幕典礼。十月一日这一天，在蒙古首都和全国十八个省的省会、各苏木（县）、各机关、工厂、学校和群众团体都举行了盛大的集会，庆祝“蒙中友好旬”的开幕和中华人民共和国成立三周年。从中央艾马克（省）到巴戈（区），从工厂和学校到牧民居住的蒙古包，到处都像节日似地飘扬着中蒙两国的国旗。乌兰巴托和各省省会还举办了新中国图片展览和影片展览。乌兰巴托各报和各省地方报纸都发表了社论，并以巨大篇幅连续刊载了介绍新中国建设成就的文章和照片。中央广播电台每天有二小时的介绍新中国的广播节目，这些节目从清早以中国歌曲开始，有介绍中国经济、科学、文化、教育发展的论文，有中国先进工作者的模范事迹，也有关于中国小说和诗歌的朗诵。
    蒙古各工厂企业部门的工人们展开了“蒙中友好旬”社会主义竞赛运动，用超额完成生产任务的成绩来作为给友好旬的献礼。斯大林肉类包装厂的工人们在友好旬开幕的前一周即投入了紧张的生产竞赛，每个车间都订立了具体的计划。该厂一个老工人、大人民呼拉尔代表根顿道尔吉，计划要在友好旬的十天中完成香肠生产任务的百分之二百五十。废品利用车间的突击队员万勤，在友好旬开始的第一天即超额完成生产任务五倍。那莱哈煤矿第十四矿工人为了迎接友好旬，七天完成了十天的生产任务。工人们提出的口号是：“以劳动竞赛的成绩向伟大的邻邦中国人民致敬。”
