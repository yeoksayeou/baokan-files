    Jingxing Mining Bureau Inspects Bureaucracy and Conservative Thought
    Editor: After reading the critical letter "Many Problems Exist in Jingxing Coal Mine, Should Be Resolved Quickly and Seriously" published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on August 23rd, we immediately convened relevant personnel for inspection. The newspaper's criticism is correct and will greatly help us improve our work in the future.
    Our bureau indeed has many serious problems in production reform and safety work. The existence of these problems is inseparable from the bureau's leadership's bureaucracy and the conservative thinking of the technical personnel.
    In the second half of 1950, our bureau began to experiment with the "strip filling mining method" and "descending layered caving method" for raw coal seams. Because the technical personnel lacked research on these advanced methods and emphasized the bureau's "poor natural conditions," they were afraid to experiment boldly and wavered when encountering difficulties. Moreover, because the coal areas had suffered destructive exploitation during the enemy-puppet period, the technical personnel lacked confidence in implementing new mining methods in the damaged coal seams, which hindered the production reform work and prevented its completion as scheduled. The key issue of the new mining methods is roof management. We were unable to find certain rules for this, the cyclical operations were not standardized, and roof collapse accidents sometimes occurred. In terms of electromechanical work, due to the conservative thinking and old technical viewpoints of the technical personnel, the improvement of equipment and the exploitation of potential capabilities were poorly done. The rope hook design of the circulating cars was poor, which seriously affected production in January and February. Although plans to replace the large steam pumps with electric pumps to reduce mine temperature were made early, they have not yet been realized. The existence of old technical viewpoints and conservative thinking among technical personnel is the result of weak ideological and political education work by the leadership. The serious problems existing in safety work are mainly due to the leadership's bureaucracy, the lack of thorough inspection and installation of safety equipment, and the lack of systematic safety and technical operating procedure education for workers. The workers do not understand safety common sense and technology, and they work in unsafe environments for a long time, resulting in continuous accidents that cause serious damage to the workers' lives and health.
    The above problems have now been preliminarily resolved. We accepted the criticism from the Party newspaper and the instructions from higher authorities. Combining the study of Minister Chen Yu's report from the Ministry of Fuel Industry, "On the basis of the victory of the Three-Anti Movement, thoroughly inspect the principles and tasks of the state-owned fuel industry," we conducted ideological inspections of technical personnel and cadres, initially exposing and correcting the influence of conservative thinking, purely technical viewpoints, and bourgeois ideology, and began comprehensive production reform work. In August, the proportion of new mining methods had increased to 81%. Recently, two major safety inspections were carried out, and safety equipment such as pressure-resistant rubber gloves, rubber shoes, safety belts, anti-fall safety blasting devices, and safety doors for electricians were added. Issues that need to be resolved by higher authorities have been planned and budgeted, and can be resolved after being submitted for approval. In terms of strengthening safety education, we have opened safety training classes and technical training classes. A circulating oil pump has been added to the ventilator of the No. 1 mine, which has basically solved the problem of bearing bush heating. The roadway improvement project has been completed, and electric locomotives are being used in the main roadways, gradually eliminating mule and horse transport. The phenomenon of manual haulage has been basically eliminated. Regarding the problem of spontaneous combustion areas, the comprehensive sealing project has been approved by higher authorities and is being carried out vigorously.
    In the future, we will continue to expose and overcome bureaucracy in leadership, strengthen the ideological and political education of technical personnel, thoroughly eliminate conservative thinking and purely technical viewpoints, and ensure the completion of the production reform tasks assigned by the state.

### 井陉矿务局检查官僚主义和保守思想

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    井陉矿务局检查官僚主义和保守思想
    编辑同志：读了八月二十三日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表的“井陉煤矿问题很多应该迅速认真解决”的批评信，我们即召集有关人员作了检查。报纸的批评是正确的，对我们今后改进工作有很大帮助。
    我局在生产改革和保安工作方面，的确存在着很多问题，性质也较严重。这些问题的存在是与我局领导上的官僚主义和技术人员的保守思想分不开的。
    一九五○年下半年，我局开始试验原煤层的“带状充填采煤法”和“下行分层陷落法”，因为技术人员对于这一先进方法缺乏研究，强调本局“自然条件差”，不敢大胆试验，一遇到困难就动摇了。又因为煤区在敌伪时期多遭受过掠夺式的破坏性的开采，技术人员对于在残破煤层施行新采煤方法更缺乏信心，因而使生产改革工作受到障碍，未能如期完成。新采煤方法的关键问题是顶板管理，对此，我们不能找出一定的规律，循环作业不正规，还有时发生冒顶事故。机电工作方面也由于技术人员存在保守思想与旧技术观点，对改善设备，发挥潜在能力做得很差。循环车的绳钩设计不善，曾在一、二月间严重地影响了生产；改用电泵代替大汽泵以减低矿井温度，虽早有计划也迄未实现。技术人员的旧技术观点和保守思想的存在，是领导上政治思想教育工作薄弱的结果。在保安工作方面存在着的严重问题，主要是领导上的官僚主义，对安全设备缺乏周密的检查与设置，对工人缺乏系统的保安与技术操作规程的教育；工人不懂得保安常识和技术，而又长期在不安全的环境中工作，以致事故不断发生，使工人生命健康，遭受严重的损害。
    以上问题现在均已初步获得解决。我们接受党报的批评和上级的指示，结合学习中央燃料工业部陈郁部长“在三反运动的胜利基础上，深入检查国营燃料工业的方针与任务”的报告，进行了技术人员和干部的思想检查，初步揭发和纠正了保守思想、单纯技术观点和资产阶级思想的影响，开始了全面的生产改革工作。八月份新法采煤比重已提高到百分之八十一，最近举行了两次保安大检查，添置了保安器材如电工使用的耐压胶皮手套、胶皮鞋、保险带、防坠保险放炮器和安全门等；需经上级解决的已经作出计划和预算，呈请批准后也可解决。在加强保安教育方面，我们开办了保安训练班、技术训练班。一矿的抽风机已加装循环油泵，基本上解决轴瓦发热问题。巷道改善工程已完成，大巷开始使用电车头，逐步取消骡马运输；人工拉斗现象已经基本上不存在。关于自然发火区的问题，现全面密闭工程已经上级批准，正在大力进行。
    今后我们仍要不断地揭发与克服领导上的官僚主义，加强技术人员的政治思想教育，彻底肃清保守思想和单纯技术观点，保证完成国家给予的生产改革任务。井陉矿务局
