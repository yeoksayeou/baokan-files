Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 2nd: The U.S. side again massively and collectively massacred captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on Jeju Island on the 1st, killing 52 and wounding 113 of our captured personnel. This bloody massacre occurred at 7:30 AM on October 1st, when U.S. soldiers barbarically attacked unarmed prisoners of war in Camp No. 7 of the 3A POW camp on the island. The reason was that our volunteer army prisoners insisted on singing to commemorate our great National Day. According to the Associated Press, among the prisoners killed and wounded, "most were hit by bullets," and some prisoners were "stabbed or wounded by bayonets."

The U.S. side's barbaric act of collectively massacring captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army once again exposes the U.S. side's lie that 68 percent of Chinese prisoners of war "refuse repatriation." As everyone knows, the U.S. side announced on August 23rd that they had two POW camps, No. 3A and No. 3B, on Jeju Island. Camp 3A was located in Mugeon-ri, and Camp 3B was located in Jeju City. Both of these POW camps held captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. According to a report from Jeju City by reporter Johnson, published in the "New York Herald Tribune" on August 25th, those detained in Camp 3A in Mugeon-ri were so-called "Chinese prisoners who cooperated against communism." The U.S. side has repeatedly claimed that there were as many as 15,000 such prisoners. Now, these captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who the U.S. side calls "cooperating against communism," were collectively massacred for the crime of "insurrection" simply for insisting on commemorating National Day. This makes the world fully understand the U.S. side's sinister conspiracy to forcibly detain 15,000 Chinese prisoners of war, thereby obstructing the rapid realization of armistice negotiations. It also makes the world fully understand the indomitable and strong will of our captured personnel who love their motherland and demand repatriation to their motherland.

Regarding the U.S. side's barbaric act of frantically massacring our captured personnel, General Nam Il, chief representative of our delegation, has lodged a serious protest. The full text of General Nam Il's protest is as follows:

To Lieutenant General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

On October 1st, your side cold-bloodedly shot unarmed prisoners of war from our side in the Jeju Island POW camp, killing 52 and wounding 113. Regarding this barbaric and cowardly bloody massacre, I am ordered to lodge a serious protest with your side. This major massacre exposes all the deceptive excuses your side has made for refusing to repatriate prisoners of war, shows that your side is deliberately undermining the Korean armistice negotiations, and once again proves that your side, which has already committed heinous war crimes in Korea, is determined to be an enemy of the people of Asia and the people of the world to the end. Your side must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this serious incident.

General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
October 2, 1952

    美方又在济州岛大规模集体屠杀战俘
    打死打伤我方被俘人员一百六十五人我方提出严重抗议
    【新华社开城二日电】美方一日又在济州岛上大规模地集体屠杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员，共打死我方被俘人员五十二人，打伤一百十三人。这一血腥屠杀发生在十月一日早晨七点半钟，当时美方士兵向岛上三A战俘营第七号营场中正在唱歌的赤手空拳的战俘野蛮地进攻。原因是我志愿军被俘人员坚持唱歌来纪念我们伟大的国庆节日。据美联社报道说，在被打死打伤的战俘中，“大多数都是被枪弹击中的”，还有一些战俘是“被刺刀刺死或刺伤的”。
    美方这一集体屠杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员的野蛮行为，再次揭穿了美方所谓有百分之六十八的中国战俘“拒绝遣返”的鬼话。大家知道，美方曾经在八月二十三日宣布他们在济州岛上设有第三号A和第三号B两个战俘营。三A战俘营设在慕琴浦，三B战俘营设在济州城。在这两个战俘营中的都是中国人民志愿军被俘人员。据“纽约先驱论坛报”八月二十五日刊载记者约翰逊从济州城发出的报道说，被拘留在慕琴浦三A战俘营的是所谓“合作反共的中国俘虏”，美方曾经一再宣称这样的战俘有一万五千人之多。现在这些被美方称之为“合作反共”的中国人民志愿军被俘人员竟因坚持纪念国庆而居然被加以“暴动”的罪名遭受了集体屠杀，这就使全世界完全看清楚了美方强迫扣留一万五千名中国战俘、从而阻挠停战谈判迅速实现的罪恶阴谋，也使全世界完全看清了我方被俘人员热爱祖国并要求遣返祖国的不可屈服的坚强意志。
    对于美方这种疯狂屠杀我方被俘人员的暴行，我方代表团首席代表南日将军已提出严重抗议。南日将军的抗议书全文如下：
    联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊中将：
    十月一日你方在济州岛战俘营冷血射杀手无寸铁的我方被俘人员。打死五十二人，打伤一百十三人。对于这一野蛮而又卑怯的血腥屠杀事件，我奉命向你方提出严重抗议。这一重大屠杀事件揭穿了你方拒绝遣返战俘的一切欺骗藉口，显示你方蓄意破坏朝鲜停战谈判，再一次证明已在朝鲜犯下滔天战争罪行的你方决心与亚洲人民和世界人民为敌到底。你方必须对此次严重事件所产生的一切后果负全部的责任。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军
    代表团首席代表南日将军
    一九五二年十月二日
