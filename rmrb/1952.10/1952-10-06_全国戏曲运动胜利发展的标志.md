    The Mark of the Victorious Development of the National Opera Movement
    Mei Lanfang
    In order to implement Chairman Mao's directive of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" in opera reform, the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government is hosting the First National Opera Festival on the occasion of the Third National Day, which has already begun in Beijing, the capital.
    This performance brings together the main opera genres from major administrative regions, representative new and old repertoire, and outstanding and excellent actors. It is truly an unprecedented grand event in the history of Chinese opera and a sign that Chinese opera will develop to a greater height.
    Such importance attached to the opera cause and universal support for various operas, enabling them to influence and exchange with each other and develop, is only possible in a country after the people have been liberated.
    In the past, due to regional isolation, transportation and language difficulties, and the lack of importance attached to people's opera, the opera genres in various regions, although each had its own different history, different characteristics, and each demonstrated a high degree of wisdom, were not interconnected. Although there had been mutual influence, it was only the individual activities of a few artists and was subject to various restrictions. Moreover, in the three years since liberation, reforms and creations in various aspects have not had the opportunity to be summarized nationwide through the stage. I hope that this observation and study will summarize the achievements of our national efforts over the past three years in terms of scripts, performances, and acting skills.
    Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, and the joint efforts of opera workers across the country, the people's opera cause nationwide has made great progress in the past three years, but it is still far from meeting the demands of the people. I hope that in this festival, through the joint cooperation and research of opera artists, musicians, stage workers, and actors from various regions, we can build on the basis of the past three years of victory and open up a broader path for the creation of our national opera.
    Another issue is how to better reflect reality in the people's opera movement on the existing basis; and at the same time, to grasp the correct historical viewpoint when presenting historical subjects. Through three years of efforts, we already have many scripts reflecting reality and have strictly criticized anti-historical and anti-realist dramas, but the forms of various operas are still unable to completely and flawlessly reflect the new reality, and cannot comprehensively and fundamentally eliminate the ideological influence of anti-historical and anti-realist ideas. This also requires our continued efforts in the future.
    I hope that in this conference, every one of our opera workers can seize the time, study hard, cooperate in division of labor, and exchange experiences. Each should give full play to his strengths, concentrate his energy, and conduct in-depth and specific investigations and research. Truly achieve mutual learning from experience, mutual enrichment, taking the best from each other, discarding the shortcomings, and combining with the needs of reality, to determine our own goals, so that this conference will have practical gains for each troupe and each opera worker.
    These are some of my expectations for the opera workers from all over the country who are attending the meeting. I am willing to follow everyone and study together.

    全国戏曲运动胜利发展的标志
    梅兰芳
    中央人民政府文化部为了贯彻毛主席所指示的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的戏曲改革方针，于第三届国庆节主办第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会，已经开始在首都北京举行了。
    这次演出集中了各大行政区主要的剧种，集中了有代表性的新旧剧目，集中了优秀杰出的演员，的确是中国戏曲史上空前未有的盛事，也是中国戏曲将有更高度发展的一个标志。
    对戏曲事业这样地重视，对各种戏曲普遍地予以扶持，使其互相影响，互相交流而得到发展，这样的事情，只有在人民获得了解放之后的国家才可能有。
    过去由于地区的隔离，交通和语言的困难，人民戏曲的不被重视，各个地区的剧种，虽各有其不同的历史，不同的特点，各自发挥了高度的智慧，但彼此之间是不相通的。虽然也曾互相影响，但究竟只是少数艺人的个别活动，并受到种种限制。而解放三年以来，各方面的改革与创造，更未得到一个通过舞台进行全国性的总结的机会。我希望这一回的观摩与研究，能把我们全国过去三年努力的成果，从剧本、演出、演技各方面的经验总结出来。
    由于毛主席与中央人民政府文化部的领导和全国的人民戏曲工作者的共同努力，全国的人民戏曲事业三年来有很大的发展，但距离人民的要求还是很远。我希望在这一回的观摩演出中，通过戏曲文艺工作者、音乐工作者、舞台工作者、各地演员们的共同合作与研究，在三年来胜利的基础上，为我们民族歌剧的创造开辟更宽广的道路。
    另一个问题，就是怎样在现有的基础上，使人民的戏曲运动，更好地反映现实；同时在表现历史题材的时候，能掌握正确的历史观点。通过三年的努力，我们虽已有不少反映现实的剧本，并严格地批判了反历史反现实主义的戏剧，但各种戏曲的形式，还不能做到完满无憾地反映新的现实，还不能全面地、根本地清除反历史反现实主义的思想影响，这也需要我们今后继续努力。
    我希望在这一次的会演中，我们每一个戏曲工作者，都能抓紧时间，努力学习，分工合作，交流经验。各就所长，集中精力，作深刻、具体的调查研究。真正做到彼此吸取经验，互相充实，各取所长，各弃所短，再结合现实的需要，以确定自己努力的目标，使这次大会对每一剧团每一戏曲工作者都有实际的收获。
    这是我对到会的全国戏曲工作者同志们的一些期望，我愿追随大家，一同学习。
