Editor's Note: This article originally appeared in the Pingyuan Daily on October 15th. Some words and sentences have been slightly modified here. This is a relatively good piece of reporting. It succinctly describes the basic situation of the cultural learning movement in Tuan Village, Zhongmou County, analyzes the main reasons why the peasants are so enthusiastic about learning culture, and vividly describes how cultural learning has promoted rural production and the democratization of families. The experience of Tuan Village specifically illustrates the following issues: First, the mass cultural learning movement must have the necessary ideological foundation, and the steady development of the cultural learning movement in turn continuously improves the ideological level of the masses; Second, cultural learning not only does not hinder production work, but also promotes it; Third, rapid literacy learning must be combined with the actual needs of the masses' daily life and work, and a learning environment must be created anytime and anywhere. When the masses specifically recognize the importance of cultural learning to their lives and work, learning can become regular, and the results of learning can be consolidated and improved.

The Basic Situation of New Cultural Development in Tuan Village

Tuan Village is a relatively poor village. The entire village has 110 households, 486 people, and 2,124 mu of land (mostly sandy soil). Poverty has limited the cultural development of the peasants. Before liberation, there were only two literate people in the village. Since liberation in 1944 and the land reform in 1947, under the leadership and support of the Party and the People's Government, it has become a politically progressive and economically prosperous village. 39.6% of households have a small surplus of grain, and ordinary households can eat wheat for three months of the year. With the recovery and development of the economy, the peasants' demand for culture has become increasingly urgent. In the past four years, Tuan Village has turned over in terms of culture. Of the 128 young and middle-aged men and women in the village, except for a few who were unable to attend school due to illness or busy household affairs, all others have joined the people's schools, and the elderly have also automatically participated in learning. The current situation is: the primary people's school has 70 young and middle-aged students, the advanced people's school has 55 students, and there are 12 middle school and normal school students (including 9 female students). The people's school has trained a total of 14 people as voluntary teachers of the people's school, village secretaries, and cooperative accountants, and 2 elementary school teachers. If the graduates of the primary people's school are considered non-illiterate, then 44% of the people in the village can be counted as culturally literate peasants. This cannot but be said to be a great joy in the lives of the peasants.

The cultural learning movement in this village has a history of seven years. It has grown from small to large, from low to high, from irregular to regular, from the learning activities of a few activists to a mass learning upsurge. The changes in its organizational form are: from study groups, literacy classes, winter schools, night schools to people's schools, and now the rapid literacy method has been promoted. This has put rural learning on a normal track. After the establishment of the people's school, although great achievements have been made, the learning results are not consolidated among most people. For example, the peasant Zhao Baoqing, from the winter of 1946 to the spring of this year, only recognized 350 characters. He said: "Three days a lesson, three new words a lesson, if you learn it and don't use it, you forget it." Therefore, in the past, many people "went to the people's school every year and started from scratch every year." Since the launch of the rapid literacy movement, the masses have reflected that "learning is fast, recognition is accurate, and after learning pinyin, they have found a 'teacher' (dictionary)." They have confidence in learning culture. Therefore, the cultural movement in Tuan Village has entered a new climax. Since this village promoted the rapid literacy method in April this year, the first batch of 30 peasants who originally knew more than 500 characters have now learned to read popular books and newspapers and write simple letters and short articles. At present, the entire village is preparing to further promote this experience on the existing basis and eliminate illiteracy among all young and middle-aged people.

The Basic Reasons Why Peasants Urgently Demand Cultural Learning

With the economic liberation and political elevation after the land reform, it is inevitable that peasants will demand cultural liberation. This is just as Chairman Mao told us: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear." Facts have proved that the improvement of peasant culture and economic development are inseparable. The recovery and development of agricultural production in this village (in 1951, it exceeded 34% of the pre-war total output) and the improvement of the peasants' production level are the most fundamental reasons why the peasants urgently demand culture.

Secondly, combining it with patriotic education and the current production movement has given the peasants full political enthusiasm and provided a political guarantee for cultural learning. In addition to the cultural learning of young and middle-aged people, the village also conducts political studies every "two, five, eight" day, and even the elderly classes participate. Therefore, they understand that learning serves production. And understand how to love the country, link patriotic production with national defense construction, and gradually develop the habit of caring about national affairs. The village subscribes to newspapers such as "People's Daily", "Pingyuan Daily", and "Youth Daily". People's school students have become good propagandists. Three reading groups have been established in the village. Patriotic covenants are all made by people's school students and written by the peasants themselves. Therefore, the greatest characteristic of patriotic covenants is that they are specific, vivid, and lively, and can combine individual production plans with responding to the government's call. For example, the entire village, with Party members and Youth League members as the backbone, has organized 77% of the peasants through the people's school. Last year, the government called for planting more cotton, and the entire village expanded the cotton fields to 720 mu; last year, in the donation movement, the village donated 3,070 jin of cotton; this year, the public grain was paid in full in a few hours. These achievements are inseparable from the people's school's implementation of patriotic education. The masses reflect that "responding to the government's call is patriotism."

Third, learning culture is closely linked to the vital interests of young and middle-aged men and women. Young and middle-aged people are most concerned about two personal issues: one is marriage, and the other is the future. Therefore, it is most appropriate to implement the Marriage Law through the people's school. A people's school student wrote in his diary: "Previous marriages were arranged by parents, which was the most unreasonable. Since the Communist Party came, women have raised their heads and have a status. Now it is agreed by both parties and is independent by individuals. No one can arrange marriages. How happy!" There are 22 couples who married freely in this village. The conditions for love objects are "love labor, love culture, and love progress." They understand the social future, know that machines will be used for farming in the future, and believe that "you can't get by in the new society without culture." These ideas have guaranteed the normal development of learning enthusiasm.

Fourth, the development of the cultural learning movement in this village is inseparable from the leadership of the Party and Youth League branches. Party members and Youth League members lead the masses with exemplary actions and become the backbone of learning. At the same time, through persuasion and education, they open up the minds of the masses and eliminate obstacles to learning. If the elderly have concerns in their minds, they use political classes to enlighten their minds. Women with children find it difficult to learn, so they specifically set up "kindergartens" for them. Due to the strong leadership of the Party and Youth League branches and the combination with administrative leadership, the Illiteracy Elimination Committee, the Rapid Literacy Committee, the Teaching and Research Association, and the Homework Revision Group have all persisted from beginning to end, making learning further regularized.

Several Experiences in Developing the Peasants' Cultural Learning Movement

The promotion of the rapid literacy method has made the peasants' culture leap forward. The following experiences have been gained from the experimental work in this village:

(1) Create a "Literacy Environment": The walls of the entire village are painted with phonetic alphabet charts and new word (1,500 characters) lists, with letters next to each character. The masses trace the characters on the walls while eating or working, teaching and learning from each other. In addition, there are words everywhere on streets, alleys, doors, windows, trees, and walls. For example, "tree", "Chinese toon tree", "whose Chinese toon tree", "pig", "pigsty", "house", "main room", "×××'s main room". Words on objects are easy to learn and not easy to forget. In the past, the method of "living textbooks" was used, such as "go to the market", "hoe the ground", etc., but at that time, because there was no phonetic alphabet, people often forgot. Now it is combined with current work. Such as "launching a patriotic increase production competition", "launching an evaluation movement", "promoting the rapid literacy method", all are written on small blackboards at any time, with phonetic alphabets added next to the characters. There are now 50 fountain pens and 30 dictionaries in the village. Students write down new words when they see them and look up unfamiliar words in the dictionary.

(2) Memorizing the phonetic alphabet is an important part of the rapid literacy method. Therefore, to make every student learn pinyin, first make them learn single-character sounds from memorization, and then gradually learn two-syllable and three-syllable sounds. No matter where they are, whether in the dining area or in the field, try to get them to learn.

(3) Create a family learning environment. Facts have proved that a democratic family is a favorable condition for promoting learning, and the development of the learning movement is an important part of promoting production and family democracy. In the past, parents restricted their children from reading and writing, but now they know the benefits of literacy and urge their children to learn. In the past, husbands restricted their wives from learning to read, but now husbands and wives teach and learn from each other. Mothers-in-law hold their daughters-in-law's children, allowing their daughters-in-law to free up time to participate in production and learning; daughters-in-law help their husbands chop grass and feed livestock, allowing their husbands to study (night shift); husbands wash pots and dishes for their wives, allowing their wives to study (morning class). In this way, every family becomes a democratic family of mutual respect and love. Due to family democracy, the relationship between sisters-in-law is close. Everyone learns to write notes, the younger sister writes "You have to be a learning model", and the sister-in-law writes "You have to find a dear object". This phenomenon embodies people's happy family democratic life.

(4) After initially mastering the characters, people's learning enthusiasm is even higher, and they have a demand for reading simple comic strips, stories, and short stories. The village library solved this problem. The library has a total of 617 books. Among them, there are 248 books of literature, comic strips, and children's books. Young and middle-aged men and women especially like to read stories of combat heroes, labor models, and free love novels. They circulate them among themselves, or read them together, telling stories and learning new words. Female people's school student Cai Ruihua read a dozen books while sick, and Cao Yujing read the love story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai several times. This proves that reading a lot is the best way to improve the peasants' political ideology and cultural level.

(5) Keeping a diary is the best way to help memory and consolidate learning results. Because diaries have no fixed format, they allow people to think freely. Teachers of the Zhongmou Tuan People's School planned to guide students to write diaries in combination with current work, which promoted current work and expressed their thoughts. For example, during the drought resistance, Zhou Xiegong, a student of the advanced people's school, wrote in his diary: "February 28th, the political class was in the evening. First, Secretary Liu talked about it. He said: This year is a drought year. We must resist the drought. The way to resist the drought is to dig more wells and turn dry land into paddy fields. Nineteen wells were reported that night." When electing people's representatives, female student Geng Guihua said in her diary: "February 8th was the day we elected the county magistrate. I am very happy because now it is a new democratic society and we can be masters of our own affairs. This is a very good thing. In the future, we must study hard, produce hard, and build the country." How vividly this is written. They also published rural wall newspapers, and regularly published "Peasant Weekly", "Women's Special", "Diary Special", etc. (eight issues have been published in the past nine months, with 91 articles). Through diaries or writing, students express their political, economic, and cultural lives.

    平原省中牟疃村是这样开展文化学习运动的
    中共平原省委农村工作考察组
    编者按：本文原载十月十五日平原日报，这里对某些字句略加改动。这是一篇较好的通讯。它扼要地叙述了中牟疃村文化学习运动的基本情况，分析了农民们所以那样热烈地学习文化的主要原因，生动地描述了文化学习怎样促进了农村的生产和家庭的民主化。中牟疃村的经验具体地说明了如下几个问题：第一，群众性的文化学习运动必须有必要的思想基础，而文化学习运动的稳步发展又回过来不断提高了群众的思想水平；第二，文化学习不但不会妨碍生产工作，而且推动了生产工作；第三，速成识字学习必须与群众的日常生活和工作的实际需要相结合，必须随时随地创造学习环境，群众具体认识文化学习对自己的生活和工作的重要性，这样学习便能经常化，学习的成果便能巩固和提高。
    中牟疃村新文化发展的基本情况
    中牟疃村是一个比较贫困的村庄。全村有一百一十户，四百八十六人，二千一百二十四亩地（多沙质地）。贫困限制了农民文化的发展，解放前该村仅有两个识字的人。自一九四四年解放，一九四七年土地改革以后，在党与人民政府的领导扶植下，它已成为政治进步、经济上富裕的村庄，百分之三十九点六的户有了少量余粮，一般户每年可以吃到三个月的麦子。随着经济的恢复和发展，农民对文化的要求日益迫切。近四年来中牟疃村在文化上翻了身。全村青壮年男女一百二十八人，除个别有疾病或家中事务繁忙等原因未能上学外，其他全部入了民校，老人也自动参加学习了。现在的情况是：初级民校有青壮年学员七十人，高级民校五十五人，中学、师范生十二人（其中有女生九人）。通过民校已培养出了民校义务教员、村书记、合作社会计共十四人，小学教员二人。全村如把初级民校毕业生算为非文盲的话，就有百分之四十四的人算做有文化的农民了，这不能不说是农民生活中的一件大喜事。
    该村文化学习运动已有七年历史了。它由小到大，由低到高，由不正规到正规，由少数积极分子的学习活动变为群众性的学习热潮。其组织形式的变化是：由学习小组、识字班、冬学、夜校到民校，现在则推广了速成识字法。这样使农村学习走上正常轨道。在成立民校以后，虽然取得很大成绩，但在大多数人中学习成果是不巩固的。例如农民赵保庆，从一九四六年冬天学到今年春天只认三百五十个字。他说：“三天一课、一课三个生字，学了不用，就忘了。”因而过去不少人是“年年上民校，年年从头学。”自开展速成识字运动后，群众反映“学的快，认的准，学会了拼音，找到了‘老师’（字典）”。他们学文化有了信心。因而中牟疃村的文化运动，已走上新的高潮。该村从今年四月份推广速成识字法后，第一批原来识五百字以上的三十个农民，现已学会了看通俗书报、写简单的信件和短小的文章。目前全村准备在现有的基础上，进一步推广这一经验，在青壮年中全部扫除文盲。
    农民迫切要求学习文化的基本原因
    随着土地改革后经济上的翻身，政治上的抬头，农民要求文化翻身是必然的。这正如毛主席所告诉我们的：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”事实证明，农民文化的提高和经济发展是分不开的。该村农业生产的恢复和发展（一九五一年就超过战前总产量百分之三十四）与农民生产水平的提高，正是农民迫切要求文化的最根本的原因。
    其次和爱国主义教育相结合，和当前生产运动相结合，使农民有饱满的政治情绪，使文化学习有了政治保证。除青壮年的文化学习之外，该村每逢“二、五、八”的日子还进行政治学习，连老年班也参加。因而他们懂得学习为生产服务。并懂得如何爱国，把爱国生产和国防建设联系起来，逐渐养成关心国家大事的习惯。该村订有“人民日报”、“平原日报”、
    “青年报”等报纸。民校学员成了很好的宣传员。全村已建立三个读报组。爱国公约都是通过民校学员订的，而且是由农民自己写出来的。因而爱国公约的最大特点是具体、生动、活泼，能把个人生产计划和响应政府号召结合起来。例如全村以党团员为骨干，通过民校把百分之七十七的农民组织了起来。去年政府号召多种棉花，全村把棉田扩大到七百二十亩；去年捐献运动中，该村捐献棉花三千零七十斤；今年缴公粮几个钟头就缴齐了。这些成绩和民校贯彻爱国主义教育是分不开的。群众反映：“响应政府号召就是爱国”。
    第三、学习文化是和青壮年男女的切身利益紧紧结合着。青壮年对个人问题最关心的有两个：一为婚姻大事，一为前途问题。因而通过民校贯彻婚姻法是最合适的。一个民校学员在日记本上这样写着：“先前的婚姻由家长包办，那是最不合理的，自从共产党来了，妇女才抬了头，有了地位，现在是双方同意，由个人自主，任何人不能包办婚姻，多幸福呀！”这个村子自由结婚的有二十二对。恋爱对象的条件是“爱劳动、爱文化、爱进步。”他（她）们懂得社会前途，知道将来耕作要用机器，认为“新社会没文化吃不开”。这些思想都保证了学习情绪的正常发展。
    第四、该村文化学习运动的开展是和党、青年团支部的领导分不开的。党员、青年团员以模范行动带领群众，成为学习中的骨干分子。同时通过说服教育，打通群众思想，扫除学习中的障碍。如果老年人思想上有顾虑，就以上政治课的形式来开导思想。有孩子的妇女感到难学习，就专门为她们成立了“幼儿园”。由于党、青年团支部坚强的领导并和行政领导结合，扫除文盲委员会、速成识字委员会、教学研究会、修改作业组等，都自始至终地坚持了下来，使学习进一步走向正规。
    开展农民文化学习运动的几点经验
    速成识字法的推行，使农民文化飞跃前进。从该村的实验工作中得到了以下几点体会：
    （一）创造“识字环境”：全村墙壁上都涂写了注音字母表，生字（一千五百个）表，字旁均有字母。群众在吃饭或干活时都在墙边比画着，互教互学。此外，街头、巷口、门窗、树木、墙壁上到处有字。例如“树”、“椿树”、“谁的椿树”、“猪”、
    “猪圈”、“屋”、“堂屋”、“×××的堂屋”。物上有字，易学不易忘。过去曾用过“活教材”的方法，例如“赶集去”，“锄地”等，但那时因没有注音字母人们常常忘记。现在和当前工作结合起来。如“开展爱国增产竞赛运动”、“开展评比运动”、“推广速成识字法”，均用小黑板随时写出来，字旁均添加注音字母。现该村有五十支钢笔，三十部字典。学员们见生字就记下来，发现不认识的字就查字典。
    （二）背会注音字母是速成识字法的重要一环，因此要使每一个学员都学会拼音，首先要使他们从背诵中学会单字音，再逐渐学二拼音、三拼音。不管任何地方，在饭场或在田间，都要设法让他们学习。
    （三）创造家庭学习环境。事实证明民主家庭是促进学习的有利条件，而学习运动的开展又是促进生产与家庭民主的重要一环。过去父母限制儿女读书识字，现在知道了识字的好处，都督促子女学习。过去丈夫限制妻子识字，现在是夫妻互教互学。婆婆替媳妇抱小孩，让媳妇腾出功夫参加生产、学习；媳妇帮丈夫铡草喂牲口，让丈夫学习（夜班）；丈夫替老婆洗锅、洗碗，让老婆学习（上午班）。这样，每一个家庭就成为互敬互爱的民主家庭。由于家庭民主，姑嫂关系密切了。大家学习写纸条，小姑写“你要当个学习模范”，嫂子写“你要找个亲爱的对象”。这一现象体现着人们的愉快的家庭民主生活。
    （四）初通文字后，人们的学习情绪更高了，有了阅读浅显的连环画、故事、短篇小说的要求。该村图书馆解决了这个问题。图书馆共有书六百一十七本。其中文艺、连环画、小儿书共二百四十八本。青壮年男女尤其爱看战斗英雄、劳动模范的故事和自由恋爱的小说。他们互相传阅，或者在一块读，扯着故事，学着生字。妇女民校学员蔡瑞华在病中看了十来本书，曹玉景把梁山伯祝英台的恋爱故事看了数遍。这证明了大量阅读是提高农民政治思想、文化水平的最好方法。
    （五）记日记是帮助记忆，巩固学习成果的最好形式。因为日记没有固定的格式，它可以使人们自由思想。中牟疃民校教员有计划地结合当前工作指导学员作日记，这样既推动了当前工作，又使他们表达了思想。如抗旱时，高级民校学员周协功的日记写道：“二月二十八日，晚上是上的政治课，首先是刘支书谈的，他说：今年是个旱年，我们要抗旱，抗旱的办法，就是多打井，把旱田变水田，当晚就报了十九眼。”选举人民代表时妇女学员耿桂香在日记中说：“二月初八日，是我们选举县长的那一天，我很高兴，因为现在是新民主主义社会，我们能当家了，这是很好的事情，今后一定要好好学习，好好生产，建设国家。”这写得多么生动呀。他们还出版了农村墙报，定期出“农民周刊”、“妇女专刊”、“日记专刊”等（九个月来已出刊八期，登了九十一篇稿子）。学员们通过日记或写作表现了自己的政治、经济与文化生活。
