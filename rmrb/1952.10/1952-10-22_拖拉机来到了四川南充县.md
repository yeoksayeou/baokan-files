    Tractors Arrive in Nanchong County, Sichuan
    To the Editor: On September 28th, the state-owned farm in the Nanchong Special District of Sichuan (formerly the state-owned farm of the North Sichuan District) received tractors. This event brought hope of happiness to the 800,000 farmers in Nanchong County. The farmers of Nanchong had never seen tractors before. Some did not believe that tractors could plow the land, while others thought that using machines to plow would compact the soil.
    On October 1st, the news spread that the tractors would perform a plowing demonstration at the farm. Representatives from all districts and townships in the county who were attending the People's Representative Assembly hardly slept all night. Some got up before dawn, discussing tractors in groups of three or five. Zheng Guoyou of the North Sichuan District's Mutual Aid Banner said, "I never dreamed that I would see a tractor today."
    On October 1st, in addition to the people's representatives from the entire county, men, women, and children from the surrounding villages of the farm beat drums, performed the yangko dance, and put on new clothes to watch the machines plow the land at the farm.
    The tractors started with a roar. The tractor driver sat comfortably on the driver's seat, operating the machine to plow the land, turning the soil deeply and quickly. Everyone exclaimed in unison, "We farmers are busy and tired all day long, and the oxen are out of breath, but we can only plow a few burdens of paddy field in a day. Look how fast the tractor is!" Some farmers who doubted that machine plowing could plow deeply or finely also touched the soil plowed by the tractor with their hands and measured the depth of the plowing with their fingers. Farmer Jiang Qingrong said, "Machine plowing is really good, it plows deeply, plows finely, and the grass is turned down; it is also plowed very evenly. When we use oxen to pull the plow, we plow coarsely in one direction and finely in another, the grass cannot be completely turned down, and we are covered in sweat." Farmer Tang Zhiguo said, "It used to be said that the soil is no more than two inches deep, and the bowl is no more than two inches deep. Look, the machine can plow eight inches deep. We can't believe this old saying anymore."
    When the machines stopped, the farmers gathered together to talk. Everyone said, "We have so little land, how can we use machines!" The final conclusion was: "To use machines, we must organize ourselves." So some people said that when they returned, they would definitely consolidate their mutual aid teams, move forward step by step, and strive to use machines as soon as possible and live a happier life.

    拖拉机来到了四川南充县
    编辑同志：九月二十八日，四川南充专区的国营农场（原川北区国营农场）运到了拖拉机。这件事情，给南充县八十多万农民带来了幸福的希望。南充的农民从来没有见过拖拉机，有的人不相信有拖拉机耕地这回事，有的人以为用机器耕地会把地压紧了。
    十月一日，拖拉机要在农场作耕地表演的消息传出来了，来自全县各区乡参加人民代表会的代表，几乎整晚上都没有睡觉。有的人天不亮就起来，三、五成群地在一块谈论拖拉机。川北区互助旗帜郑国友说：“我梦想不到今天就能看到拖拉机。”
    十月一日这一天，除全县的人民代表以外，农场附近的男女老幼都打起腰鼓，扭起秧歌，穿上新衣服，到农场来看机器耕地。
    拖拉机轰隆隆地开动了，拖拉机手很轻松地坐在驾驶台上，驾驶着机器翻地，翻得又深又快。大家都不约而同地惊叹说：“我们农民一天到晚都在忙累，牛拉得喘不过气来，但一天不过犁几挑谷子地，你看拖拉机多快呀！”一些怀疑机器耕地耕不深耕不细的农民，还用手去摸拖拉机耕过的泥土，用手指去量耕地的深浅。农民蒋青荣说：“机器耕地硬是好，犁得深，耕得细，草也翻下去了，耕得还很匀净；我们用牛拉犁，粗一犁，细一犁，草不能完全翻下去，还累得满身流汗。”农民唐治国说：“原说地无二寸土，碗无二寸深，你看机器能耕八寸深，这句老话可不能相信了。”
    当机器停下以后，农民们都聚在一起大谈起来。大家都说：“我们地又少，怎么用机器嘛！”最后的结论是：“要用机器只有组织起来。”于是有的人表示：回去一定把互助组巩固起来，一步一步地向前走，争取早用机器，早过更幸福的日子。  百洋
