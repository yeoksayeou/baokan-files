    China's First Modern Flax Factory
    Harbin Flax Factory Begins Production
    China's first modern flax factory, the Harbin Flax Factory, was completed and began production just before National Day.

    Construction of the Harbin Flax Factory began on July 1, 1950. The factory building area is 180,000 square meters, and the entire design was carried out according to the Soviet Union's new factory design plan, with a very scientific layout. The factory's four main workshops are equipped with the latest high-speed machinery from the Soviet Union, and some machines are operated by electric buttons. The factory's safety and employee welfare facilities are also completely modern. Exhaust fans installed near the machines can remove scattered fibers and dust at any time, keeping the air in the workshop clean at all times. Huge blowers regulate the workshop temperature, delivering cool or hot air. Harmoniously colored walls protect workers' eyes from irritation; specially made chemical floors reduce fatigue during work. In addition, the factory's employee dormitories, canteens, and bathhouses are also large in scale, and hospitals, nurseries, and clubs will be built.

    The construction of the Harbin Flax Factory fully demonstrates the Soviet people's selfless assistance to the Chinese people. The design of this factory was entirely done by Soviet experts. The work of construction and installation of machinery was also personally guided by Soviet experts. During the work process, Chinese employees learned and mastered various advanced Soviet experiences, thereby accelerating the progress of the project, ensuring project quality, and reducing project costs. The weaving branch of this factory completed the installation task one month ahead of schedule. The flax combing branch and spinning branch completed the installation task twenty days ahead of schedule. Currently, with the help of Soviet experts, 483 technical workers have been trained. This has laid a good foundation for future production.

    After the Harbin Flax Factory goes into production, it can produce a large amount of linen, canvas, rainproof cloth, water hose cloth, carrying cloth, and various industrial products. Northeast China is rich in flax, and the completion of the flax factory will play a significant role in improving industrial production and improving people's lives.

    我国第一个近代化的亚麻工厂
    哈尔滨亚麻厂开始生产
    我国第一个近代化的亚麻工厂——哈尔滨亚麻厂，已于国庆前夕竣工，并开始生产。
    哈尔滨亚麻厂在一九五零年七月一日开始修建，厂房面积十八万平方公尺，全部设计都是按照苏联新的工厂设计计划进行的，分布十分科学。工厂四个主要车间，都装着苏联最新式的高速度的机械，一些机器都用电钮操纵。该厂的安全与职工福利设备，也完全是近代化的，安装在机器附近的抽风机，可以随时将散扬的纤维和尘埃抽出去，使车间空气经常保持清洁。巨大的吹风机，调节着车间温度，输送冷气或热气。色调调和的墙壁，保护着工人的眼睛不受刺激；特制的化学地板，使工作时减少疲累。此外，该厂的职工宿舍、食堂和澡堂，也都规模宏大，并将修建医院、托儿所和俱乐部。
    哈尔滨亚麻厂的修建，充分表现了苏联人民对于中国人民无私的援助。这个工厂的设计全是由苏联专家做的。施工和安装机器的工作，也是由苏联专家亲自指导。在工作过程中，中国员工学习和掌握了各种苏联先进的经验，因而加速了工程进度，保证了工程质量，降低了工程成本。这个工厂的织布分厂，提前一个月完成安装任务。梳麻分厂和纺纱分厂，提前二十天完成安装任务。现在，在苏联专家的帮助下，已培养了四百八十三名技术工人。这就给今后生产准备了很好的基础。
    哈尔滨亚麻厂生产以后，可以出产大量的亚麻布、帆布、防雨布、水龙布、抬布和各种工业用品。东北北部盛产亚麻，亚麻厂的修成，对提高工业生产和改善人民生活，将起很大的作用。
