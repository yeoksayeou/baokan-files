    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, October 24th: On the eve of the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's entry into Korea to fight, a special correspondent of this agency raised several questions regarding the situation of the Korean War to the spokesman of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters, who kindly provided the following answers:

    Question: What great victories have the Chinese People's Volunteer Army achieved since entering Korea to fight two years ago? What changes have these victories brought about in the Korean war against aggression?

    Answer: Since our Volunteer Army appeared on the Korean battlefield in October 1950 and fought alongside the Korean People's Army, we have jointly achieved the great victory of annihilating more than 660,000 enemy troops, laying a solid foundation for the final victory of the Korean war against aggression.

    The Korean War, in which the Chinese and Korean people's armies fought side by side for two years, can be divided into two stages: before and after the Fifth Campaign. In the first seven months of the two years, the Chinese and Korean people's armies launched five large-scale campaigns successively, fundamentally reversing the war situation and driving the American invading army back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel. After the Fifth Campaign, the Chinese and Korean people's armies conducted large-scale defensive operations on the line near the 38th parallel, thwarting hundreds of large and small offensives by the enemy in seventeen months and annihilating more than 450,000 enemy troops. In the summer and autumn of last year, although our army's fortifications had not yet been completed, it was able to defeat the enemy's concentrated attacks with a large number of troops and superior equipment. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in the offensive, gaining only a small amount of progress. After October of last year, the enemy was unable to advance an inch, and the defense line of the Chinese and Korean people's armies not only did not move backward but also advanced several kilometers in some areas during counterattacks. The Chinese and Korean people's armies have gained a firm foothold on the current front. Especially in the recent two or three months, the tactical counterattacks jointly launched by various arms of the Chinese and Korean people's armies have inflicted very heavy blows on the enemy.

    In the past two years, the Chinese and Korean people's armies have achieved equally brilliant victories in air defense operations, anti-bacterial warfare, and anti-chemical warfare as in ground operations. In the past two years, the Chinese and Korean people's armies shot down and damaged more than 7,000 enemy aircraft over the front and rear. Especially in the second year, due to the appearance of our People's Air Force, the strengthening of ground anti-aircraft fire, and the development of mass anti-aircraft shooting campaigns, the number of enemy aircraft shot down and damaged increased by more than 4,700 compared with the first year. In the fight against the enemy's vicious germ warfare and chemical warfare, the Chinese and Korean people's armies took necessary measures in a timely manner to effectively prevent the hazards of germs and poison gas. The hygiene movement launched by the Chinese and Korean people's armies has further improved the hygiene and health level of the troops on the basis of the original good foundation.

    Due to the continuous great victories of the Chinese and Korean people's armies in the five campaigns, the American aggressors were hit unprecedentedly severely, which forced the U.S. government to start the Korean armistice negotiations on July 10, 1951. For more than fifteen months, the U.S. side lacked sincerity for the armistice and tried every means to delay and obstruct the negotiations. The Chinese and Korean people's armies defeated the enemy's conspiracies and tricks in the negotiations just as they defeated the enemy's conspiracies and tricks on the battlefield. The representatives of the Chinese and Korean people's armies showed the greatest sincerity and infinite patience in striving for peace in Korea, insisted on negotiations, and insisted on the principle of solving problems on a fair and reasonable basis, thus finally completing the draft armistice agreement. As long as the U.S. government no longer obstructs the issue of prisoners of war, the Korean armistice can be realized. The firm efforts of the Chinese and Korean people's armies to strive for peace in Korea are a major contribution to the world peace movement.

    From what has been said above, the Chinese and Korean people's armies have become stronger and stronger in the two years of fighting side by side, and have achieved great victories in all aspects. As Commander Peng Dehuai said, this victory "shows the people of the world who love peace a truth—the war schemes of imperialism can be defeated, and peace can be defended!"

    Question: In what aspects is the Volunteer Army becoming stronger and stronger?

    Answer: In summary, there are the following points:

    First, in the two years of combat and more than fifteen months of negotiations, the cruel and war-mongering face of U.S. imperialism has been fully exposed. Our army's hatred for the enemy has become more profound, and its determination to resist aggression and defend peace has become stronger. On the basis of this further improvement in political awareness, all our commanders and fighters have further demonstrated their courage, initiative, and creativity in combat, earnestly summarized combat experience, worked hard to master and learn to use modern technical equipment, improved their tactical and technical level, and transformed themselves into a heroic force capable of conducting modern warfare.

    Second, our army has accumulated rich experience in fighting the U.S. imperialist army, especially learning a set of skills for modern positional defense warfare. Our army and the heroic Korean People's Army have established large-scale and strong defense fortifications, turning the positions into steel fortresses and interlinking them into a tight combat system. Relying on such strong fortifications, our army and the Korean People's Army have successfully conducted positional defense warfare by using various tactical means such as blocking, counterattacking, raiding, ambushing, and sniping, thwarting all offensives by the U.S. invading army and its accomplice forces with many planes, many cannons, and many tanks, and greatly depleting the enemy's war power.

    Third, our army has greatly improved its equipment and significantly strengthened its combat effectiveness. When our army entered Korea, it had neither an air force nor tanks, only a small number of artillery and light firearms for the infantry. Now our army has special forces and other technical arms, and the firearms of the infantry units have been strengthened. These new arms of our army have been tempered in actual combat and have played a significant role. For example, in the nine months of this year, the number of enemy troops killed and wounded by our army's artillery accounted for an average of 24.6 percent of the total number of 139,156 enemies annihilated by our army in nine months.

    Fourth, our army has created a logistics and transportation force suitable for modern warfare, increasing transportation efficiency dozens of times. On our army's transportation line stretching more than 1,000 kilometers from the rear to the front, our strong logistics and transportation force overcame the destruction of enemy aircraft and the difficulties of natural phenomena such as wind, snow, and floods, ensuring the material needs of the front. Especially in the second year, our army's transportation force not only provided the entire army with sufficient ammunition, food, and clothing, but also provided the entire army with a large number of daily necessities and cultural and recreational equipment; not only solved the supply problem of the entire army, but also helped solve most of the transportation capacity needed by the North Korean national economy.

    It must be pointed out that the growing strength of our army is inseparable from the strong support of the people of the motherland and the assistance of the Korean people. The movement of the people of the motherland to donate new weapons has directly helped the establishment of our army's modern arms. Our great motherland has inexhaustible human, material, and financial resources; with the help of the people of the motherland, our army is in an invincible position.

    Question: What kind of failures has the U.S. aggressor suffered on the Korean battlefield in the past two years? What fundamental weaknesses has it exposed?

    Answer: The U.S. aggressor has suffered unprecedented disastrous defeats on the Korean battlefield in military, political, and moral terms.

    The U.S. aggressor rashly launched the war of aggression against Korea, initially attempting to destroy Korea with a blitzkrieg, but has now fallen into the quagmire of a protracted war of attrition. In the past two years, more than 290,000 U.S. combat troops have been annihilated, equivalent to more than fifteen full-strength army divisions. This is a huge and irreparable loss for the U.S. aggressor, which is originally short of troops, and it is impossible to cope with such a consumption of troops for a long time. Secondly, the consumption of U.S. military equipment and war materials is also extremely large. In the past two years, the U.S. military expenditure has reached 20 billion U.S. dollars. The more than 7,000 enemy aircraft, more than 2,000 tanks, and more than 3,000 artillery pieces captured, destroyed, and damaged by the Chinese and Korean people's armies in the past two years are mostly from the U.S. aggressor army. This huge consumption is also difficult for U.S. imperialism to bear for a long time. Not only that, U.S. imperialism, which is trying to launch a world war, is already in a strategic dilemma of being unable to attend to everything. On the Korean front, which is only more than 200 kilometers long, the U.S. military force here accounts for one-third of its army divisions and more than one-fifth of its air force. In the past two years, the U.S. aggressor has used a force of 1.5 million troops in the Korean War, accounting for 41 percent of its existing armed forces nationwide. The difficulties for the United States to fight a world war can be imagined. However, the U.S. aggressor is actively preparing for this war, which is hated by the people of the world.

    The failure of the U.S. invading army on the Korean battlefield is an unprecedented failure in U.S. war history. Therefore, the crazy arrogance of U.S. imperialism has been hit, and its prestige among its puppet countries has been greatly weakened. The policy of U.S. imperialism to insist on the war of aggression against Korea is increasing its quarrels with its puppet countries; it is also causing greater dissatisfaction among its own people and causing even lower morale among its troops. The U.S. people's peace movement is moving forward. In the Korean War, U.S. imperialism violated international law and abandoned humanitarian principles, using bacterial weapons, chemical weapons, napalm bombs that destroy humanity, and the atrocities of forcibly detaining and slaughtering prisoners of war, arousing the hatred of peace-loving people all over the world. U.S. imperialism has also suffered unprecedented failures in U.S. history in political and moral terms.

    The U.S. aggressor is fundamentally unable to save its failure on the Korean battlefield. If it is obsessed with its own way and insists on the unjust war of aggression against Korea, then it can only have a tragic future of final failure.

    Question: What is the development prospect of the Korean War? What will be the task of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the future?

    Answer: The Korean War was launched by the U.S. imperialists directly commanding the Li Chengrui gang. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were forced to take up arms to resist aggression. Our side has consistently advocated the realization of the Korean armistice and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis. We have made persevering efforts for this in the past, and we are still making such efforts now. However, U.S. imperialism is continuing the war on the one hand, and is still obstructing the armistice negotiations on the other hand, stubbornly insisting on the unreasonable demand to detain our captured personnel. Recently, it unilaterally announced an indefinite adjournment and suspended negotiations. The U.S. side attempts to use this unreasonable action to undermine the negotiations to pressure the UN General Assembly to agree to its plot to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations and expand the war. Our army and the Korean People's Army will never allow this plot of U.S. imperialism to be realized. All commanders and fighters of our army must make persistent efforts, work together with the Korean People's Army to continue to struggle for ending the Korean War and peacefully resolving the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis, and we will never stop until we achieve our goal! At the same time, our army is maintaining high vigilance, and is working hard to improve its combat effectiveness, consolidate and strengthen the combat unity with the Korean army and people, and at any time strike at any aggression by the enemy. If the enemy insists on fighting, we are determined to fight to the victorious end of the Korean anti-aggression war. Our army and the Korean People's Army are together, resolutely fighting to the end for the sacred cause of defending peace in Asia and the world!

    我志愿军司令部发言人就朝鲜战争形势的若干问题发表谈话
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】在中国人民志愿军入朝作战两周年前夕，本社特派记者向中国人民志愿军司令部发言人提出有关朝鲜战争形势的若干问题，承其答复如下：
    问：中国人民志愿军入朝作战两年以来获得了那些伟大胜利？这些胜利对于朝鲜反侵略战争引起了什么变化？
    答：我们志愿军一九五零年十月出现在朝鲜战场，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战以来，已经共同获得了歼灭敌军六十六万多人的伟大胜利，奠定了朝鲜反侵略战争最后胜利的稳固基础。
    朝中人民军队并肩作战两年来的朝鲜战争，可划分为第五战役以前和以后两个段落。朝中人民军队在两年的头七个月中先后进行了五次大规模的战役，根本扭转了战局，把美国侵略军赶回到三八线附近。第五次战役以后，朝中人民军队在三八线附近的战线上进行规模巨大的防御作战，在十七个月中粉碎了敌军千百次的大小进攻，歼灭敌军达四十五万多人。去年夏秋两季，我军阵地工事虽然尚未构筑完成，但已能击败敌人集中大量兵力和优势装备所发动的各次重点进攻。敌人在进攻中遭受了重大伤亡，而获得的仅是少许的进展。到去年十月以后，敌人已是寸步难进，而朝中人民军队的防线不仅没有后移，且在反击中，在若干地区向前推进了数公里。朝中人民军队已在目前的战线上站稳了脚跟。尤其是最近两三个月来，朝中人民军队各兵种联合举行的战术反击，更使敌军遭受了十分惨重的打击。
    两年来，朝中人民军队在对空作战、反细菌战、反化学战等战线上取得了与地面作战同样光辉的胜利。两年中，朝中人民军队在前线和后方上空击落击伤敌机达七千架以上。尤其是在第二年中，由于我人民空军的出现、地面高射炮火的加强以及群众性的对空射击运动的展开，击落击伤的敌机就比第
    一年增加了四千七百多架。在反对敌人毒辣的细菌战、化学战中，朝中人民军队都及时采取了必要的措施，有效地防止了病菌与毒气的危害。朝中人民军队开展的卫生运动，更使部队人员的卫生健康水平在原有的良好基础上大大提高了一步。
    由于朝中人民军队连续获得五次战役的伟大胜利，空前严重地打击了美国侵略者，才迫使美国政府在一九五一年七月十日开始朝鲜停战谈判。十五个多月来，美方对停战缺乏诚意，曾千方百计地拖延和阻挠谈判。朝中人民军队如同在战场上击败敌人的阴谋诡计一样，在谈判中也击败了敌人的阴谋诡计。朝中人民军队的代表在谈判中表现了争取朝鲜和平的最大诚意和无限忍耐，坚持谈判，坚持在公平合理的基础上解决问题的原则，因而终于使停战谈判完成了停战协定草案。只要美国政府不再在俘虏问题上阻挠，朝鲜停战就可以实现。朝中人民军队争取朝鲜和平的坚决努力，是对世界和平运动的一个重大贡献。
    从以上所说，朝中人民军队在两年来的并肩作战中，已经愈战愈强，并且取得了各方面的伟大胜利。正如彭德怀司令员所说，这一胜利“向全世界爱好和平的人民昭示了一个真理——帝国主义的战争阴谋是可以被打败的，和平是能够保卫的！”
    问：志愿军愈战愈强表现在那些方面？
    答：归结起来说，有下列几点：
    一、在两年的作战和十五个多月的谈判中，美帝国主义残忍好战的凶暴面目已经暴露无遗，我军对敌人的仇恨更加深刻，反抗侵略、保卫和平的决心更加坚强。在这一政治觉悟更加提高的基础上，我全体指挥员战斗员更加发挥了在战斗中的勇敢性、积极性和创造性，认真的总结作战经验，努力掌握与学会使用现代化的技术装备，提高自己的战术技术水平，把自己变为一支能够进行现代战争的英雄部队。
    二、我军已经积累了与美帝国主义军队作战的丰富经验，尤其是学会了现代阵地防御作战的一套本领。我军和英雄的朝鲜人民军建立了规模巨大的坚强防御工事，并使阵地变成钢铁般的堡垒，互相联结成严密的战斗体系。我军和朝鲜人民军即依托这样强固的工事，运用阻击、反击、袭击、伏击和狙击等各种战术手段，胜利地进行了阵地防御作战，粉碎了飞机多、大炮多、坦克多的美国侵略军及其帮凶军的一切进攻，大量消耗了敌军的战争力量。
    三、我军业已大大地改善了自己的装备，显著地加强了自己的战斗力。我军入朝作战时，既无空军，又无坦克，只有少数的炮兵和步兵的轻型火器。现在我军已有了特种兵及其他技术兵种，步兵部队的火器业已加强。我军的这些新兵种已在实战中得到了锻炼，并已发挥了重大作用。例如，今年九个月中，我军大炮杀伤敌军的数字，平均占我军九个月歼敌总数十三万九千一百五十六名的百分之二十四点六。
    四、我军已创造了适合现代战争的后勤运输部队，将运输效率提高了几十倍。在我军从后方到前线长达一千多公里的运输线上，我强大的后勤运输部队战胜了敌机的破坏和自然界的风雪洪水等困难，保证了前线的物质需要。尤其是在第二年度中，我军运输部队不仅使全军有充足的弹药、粮食和被服，而且使全军得到大量的日用品和文化娱乐用具；不仅解决了全军的供应问题，而且还帮助解决了北朝鲜国民经济所需要的大部分运输力。
    必须指出，我军的愈战愈强是与祖国人民的大力支援和朝鲜人民的援助分不开的，祖国人民开展的捐献新式武器的运动，更直接地帮助了我军现代化兵种的建立。我们伟大祖国有着无穷无尽的人力、物力、财力；有了祖国人民的援助，我军便立于必胜不败之地。
    问：两年来，美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上遭到了怎样的失败？它暴露了那些根本弱点？
    答：美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上已经遭到了在军事上、政治上、道义上的空前惨败。
    美国侵略者贸然发动侵朝战争，最初妄想以速决战灭亡朝鲜，然而到现在已陷入了长期消耗战的泥淖。两年来，美军作战部队被歼达二十九万多人，约合十五个多满员的陆军师。这对于本来就是兵力不足的美国侵略者来说，是一个难以补偿的巨大损失，它是无法长期应付这种兵力的消耗的。其次，美军的技术装备和战争物资的消耗也极为浩大。两年中，美军消耗的军费已达二百亿美元。朝中人民军队在两年中缴获、击毁、击伤的七千多架敌机，两千多辆坦克，三千多门大炮，其中绝大部分是美国侵略军的。这种巨大的消耗，也是美帝国主义所难于长期负担的。不仅如此，妄想发动世界大战的美帝国主义已经处于战略上顾此失彼的窘境。在短短二百多公里的朝鲜战线上，美军在这里的兵力占其陆军师团的三分之一，空军的五分之一以上。两年来，美国侵略者已在朝鲜战争中动用了数达一百五十万人的兵力，占其全国现有武装部队的百分之四十一。美国要打世界大战，其困难可想而知。但是美国侵略者却在积极地准备着这种为世界人民所痛恶的战争。
    美国侵略军在朝鲜战场上的失败是美国战史上前所未有的失败。因此美帝国主义的疯狂气焰已受打击，它在其仆从国家中的威望已经大大减弱。美帝国主义坚持侵朝战争的政策，正使它与仆从国间的争吵增多；也正在引起其国内人民的更大不满，引起其军队士气的更加低落。美国人民和平运动正在向前发展。在朝鲜战争中，美帝国主义违反国际公法和背弃人道原则，使用毁灭人类的细菌武器、化学武器、凝固汽油弹以及强迫扣留和屠杀战争俘虏的暴行，激起了全世界爱好和平人民的憎恶。美帝国主义在政治上和道义上也遭到了美国历史上前所未有的失败。
    美国侵略者已根本无法挽救它在朝鲜战场上的失败，如果它执迷不悟，坚持侵略朝鲜的非正义战争，那么，它只能有一个最后失败的悲惨前途。
    问：朝鲜战争的发展前途怎样？今后中国人民志愿军的任务是什么？
    答：朝鲜战争是美帝国主义者直接指挥李承晚匪帮发动的，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军是迫不得已才拿起武器来反抗侵略的。我们方面一贯主张在公平合理的基础上实行朝鲜停战和和平解决朝鲜问题，过去我们为此作了坚忍的努力，现在还在作这样的努力。但是，美帝国主义一面在继续进行战争，一面仍在阻挠停战谈判，蛮横地坚持扣留我方被俘人员的无理要求，最近竟片面宣布无限期休会，中止谈判。美方企图用这一破坏谈判的无理行动来压迫联合国大会赞同它破坏朝鲜停战谈判和扩大战争的诡计。我军和朝鲜人民军决不容许美帝国主义这一诡计得以实现，我全军指挥员战斗员必再接再厉，与朝鲜人民军共同为争取在公平合理的基础上结束朝鲜战争及和平解决朝鲜问题而继续奋斗，不达目的，誓不休止！同时，我军正保持高度警惕，并且正在努力提高自己的战斗力，巩固和加强与朝鲜军民的战斗团结，随时打击敌人的任何进犯。如果敌人执意要打下去，我们就决心打到朝鲜反侵略战争的胜利结束。我军和朝鲜人民军在一起，坚决为保卫亚洲与世界和平的神圣事业而奋斗到底！
