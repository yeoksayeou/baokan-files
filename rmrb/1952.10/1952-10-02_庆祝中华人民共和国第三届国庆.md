To the Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Dear Comrade Mao Zedong:

On the occasion of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Comrade, please allow me, on behalf of the Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and in my own name, to extend to you and the great Chinese people our most heartfelt congratulations.

The Bulgarian people are delighted by the Chinese people's just struggle against the bacteriological warfare waged by the American imperialists, their struggle against the dragging out of the Korean armistice negotiations, and their struggle against the Anglo-American aggressors and for peace in Asia.

I wish the great Chinese people further achievements in consolidating their People's Republic and in the struggle against the enemies of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people – the Anglo-American imperialists.

Long live the unbreakable friendship and alliance between China and the Soviet Union!

Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people!

Long live the camp of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union and the great Stalin!

This close friendship strengthens the German people's confidence in the inevitable victory of their struggle for national unity and peace, against the general war treaty and the aggressive schemes of the United States.

Dear Premier Comrade: On the occasion of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I, on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic and in my own name, extend to you, Premier Comrade, and to the Central People's Government and the Chinese people our heartfelt congratulations. Under the leadership of the great Comrade Mao Zedong, the heroes of socialist construction are developing the economy and culture of the People's Republic of China at an astonishing speed and are consolidating the regime. The example of the victorious Chinese people points out the path of self-liberation to the people of all countries who are still groaning under imperialist oppression. Honor and glory to the Chinese People's Volunteers, who are fraternally supporting the heroic liberation war of the Korean people against the American aggressors. The German people, in their struggle to restore national unity and conclude a just peace treaty, have gained the support and sympathy of the great Chinese people, who are united with them in friendship. The Chinese people and all peace-loving and progressive German people are fighting side by side with the people of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and they all belong to the great world peace camp led by our two peoples' best friend and our wise mentor, Comrade Stalin. I sincerely congratulate you and the Chinese government and peace-loving people on further great achievements in socialist construction and in the political, economic, and cultural development of the People's Republic of China.
