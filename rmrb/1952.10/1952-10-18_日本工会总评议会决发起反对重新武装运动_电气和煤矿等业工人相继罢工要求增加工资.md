    The All-Japan Council of Trade Unions Resolves to Launch Anti-Rearmament Movement
    Workers in Electric Power and Coal Mining Industries Go on Strike Successively Demanding Wage Increases
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The All-Japan Council of Trade Unions, with approximately three million members, announced on the 3rd that it had decided to launch a nationwide anti-rearmament movement while simultaneously launching an autumn offensive to demand wage increases. This decision was made at the executive committee meeting of the General Council on the same day.
    To cooperate with the General Council's autumn offensive demanding wage increases, major Japanese trade unions are generally preparing to begin strikes after mid-October.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch] Tokyo News: The All-Japan Electric Industry Workers' Union, with 120,000 members, following repeated power outage strikes on September 24th, October 3rd, and 7th, has once again staged an eight-hour power outage strike starting at 8:00 AM on the 11th, as management continues to refuse to accept the union's demands for wage increases. According to Kyodo News, workers from 165 hydroelectric power plants and 10 thermal power plants across Japan participated in this strike. It is estimated that this strike will reduce Japan's overall power generation by 20 percent.
    Meanwhile, the Japan Coal Miners' Union, with 270,000 members, is also actively preparing for a prolonged strike. The unions of 17 major coal mining companies have decided to first implement a 48-hour strike starting on October 13th and have decided to hold an indefinite strike demanding wage increases starting on October 17th. In addition, approximately 30,000 workers from small coal mining companies in Kyushu and 38,000 members of the Japan Miners' Union are also preparing to join the Japan Coal Miners' Union's strike on and after October 25th.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch] Tokyo News: Japanese workers are launching a series of strikes to demand wage increases and improve their living standards.
    Following the repeated power outage strikes by electric industry workers, the unions of 16 major coal mining companies affiliated with the Japan Coal Miners' Union began a 48-hour strike on the 13th, with 240,000 workers participating. According to the Japan Coal Miners' Union, the strike is reducing coal production by approximately 100,000 tons per day. The Coal Miners' Union has also ordered its affiliated unions to begin an indefinite strike starting on October 17th after holding this 48-hour strike. Kyodo News said that "it is generally believed that the coal miners' strike will be quite long-term." Kyodo News also predicts that the coal miners' strike "will prompt other unions to launch similar strikes demanding wage increases."
    The All-Japan Electric Industry Workers' Union has ordered union members to stage another series of power outage strikes around October 24th. At the same time, three Japanese electrical manufacturing unions have issued a joint struggle declaration. The All-Japan Automobile Industry Workers' Union, with 30,000 members, is also preparing to put forward demands for wage increases around the end of October.

    日本工会总评议会决发起反对重新武装运动
    电气和煤矿等业工人相继罢工要求增加工资
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：拥有会员约三百万人的日本工会总评议会，三日宣布决定在发动要求增加工资的秋季攻势的同时，开始一个全国规模的反对重新武装的运动。这个决定是在当天总评议会的执行委员会会议中作出的。
    为了配合总评议会要求增加工资的秋季攻势，日本各大工会一般准备在十月中旬以后开始举行罢工。
    【新华社十三日讯】东京消息：拥有十二万名会员的全日本电气产业工会，继九月二十四日、十月三日和七日的多次停电罢工以后，由于资方继续拒绝接受工会所提出的增加工资的要求，从十一日上午八时起，再次举行了八小时的停电罢工。据共同社讯，参加这次罢工的有日本全国一百六十五个水力发电厂和十个火力发电厂的工人。估计这次罢工将使日本全国的发电量减少百分之二十。
    同时，拥有二十七万会员的日本煤矿工会也在积极准备作持久的罢工。十七家大煤矿公司的工会已决定将首先于十月十三日开始实行四十八小时罢工，并决定在十月十七日开始举行要求增加工资的无一定期限的罢工。此外，九州各小煤矿公司中的约三万名工人和日本矿工会的三万八千名会员，也都准备在十月二十五日和以后参加日本煤矿工会的罢工。
    【新华社十五日讯】东京消息：日本广大工人为要求增加工资以改善生活，正在发动一连串的罢工。
    继电气产业工人的多次停电罢工以后，日本煤矿工会所属的十六个大煤矿公司的工会，从十三日开始举行了四十八小时的罢工，参加罢工的工人有二十四万人。据日本煤矿工会说，罢工使煤产量每天约减少十万吨。煤矿工会并命令所属工会在举行这次四十八小时的罢工之后，从十月十七日起开始举行无一定期限的罢工。共同社说，“一般认为煤矿工会的罢工将是相当长期的”。共同社并预料煤矿工会的罢工“将促使其他工会发动类似的要求增加工资的罢工”。
    全日本电气产业工会已命令工会会员在十月二十四日左右再度实行一连串的停电罢工。同时，日本三个电气制造业的工会已经发表了一项联合斗争的宣言。拥有三万会员的全日本汽车产业工会也准备在十月底左右提出提高工资的要求。
