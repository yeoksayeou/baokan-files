TASS, Tehran, 23rd: Tehran newspapers published on the 23rd an Iranian note on severing diplomatic relations with the British government. The note stated, "The Iranian government believes that if the British government had considered the wishes of the Iranian government and the Iranian people in a fair and friendly spirit, the relations between the two governments would not have reached this point, because the aim of the Iranian government and people, both past and present, has been solely to restore lost rights." The note also stated that, regarding the issue of the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the British government "not only did not make efforts to eliminate differences, but even obstructed the reaching of an agreement by supporting the illegal acts of the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company." In addition, the note pointed out: "Certain official representatives of the British government have also engaged in divisive and intolerable acts of interference, creating various difficulties in Iran to undermine domestic order and tranquility." The note finally informed the British Chargé d'Affaires that Iranian embassy staff in London had been ordered to return to Tehran within a week.

    伊朗宣布断绝伊英外交关系
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社德黑兰二十三日讯：二十三日德黑兰报纸刊载了伊朗关于与英国政府断绝外交关系的照会。照会指出，“伊朗政府认为，要是英国政府本着公正和友好的精神来考虑伊朗政府与伊朗人民的愿望，两国政府之间的关系就不致到这个地步，因为伊朗政府和人民过去和现在的目的，只不过要恢复丧失了的权利而已。”照会还说，在关于前英伊石油公司的问题上，英国政府“不但没有对消除分歧尽过力量，甚至还用支持前英伊石油公司的非法行为来阻挠达成协议”。此外，照会并指出：“英国政府若干官方代表，并进行了挑拨离间和不可容忍的干涉行动，在伊朗制造种种困难，以破坏国内的秩序与安宁。”照会最后通知英国代办说，伊朗驻伦敦大使馆人员已奉命在一星期内回到德黑兰。
