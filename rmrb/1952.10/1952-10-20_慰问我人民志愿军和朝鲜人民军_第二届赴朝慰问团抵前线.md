The delegation, led by General Leader Liu Jingfan and Deputy General Leaders Chen Yi, Hu Juewen, Li Minghao, and Zhou QinYue, departed from Beijing on September 18th and arrived at the Korean front lines in early October.

At the send-off rally, Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, in his send-off speech, hoped that the delegation would report to the heroic soldiers defending peace on the Korean front lines the glorious achievements of the Chinese people's reforms and construction in various fields over the past three years, convey the deep concern and lofty respect of the entire Chinese people for the Chinese-Korean people's troops and the Korean people, and express the Chinese people's determination and confidence to fully support the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in order to achieve a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue. At the same time, he hoped that the delegation, upon returning home after completing its mission, would convey to the people of the whole country the spirit of new heroism combining the high internationalism and patriotism of the Volunteers and the deeds of the Korean military and civilians in their unwavering and heroic struggle, so as to inspire the people of the whole country to carry out the large-scale economic and cultural construction that is about to begin with all their strength.

The delegation carried a large number of gifts, including 700 silk banners, more than 50,000 letters of greetings from people of all walks of life, 140,000 letters of greetings from the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and the delegation, as well as commemorative albums and stationery for the second anniversary of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, photos of the great motherland, enamel cups, handkerchiefs, cigarettes, candies, and other gifts.

After arriving at the Korean front lines, the delegation immediately began to visit the heroic sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the Chinese People's Volunteers—and the heroic friends of the Chinese people—the Korean People's Army and the Korean people. The delegation will participate in the commemoration meetings held in various units to mark the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war in Korea, celebrating the great victory achieved by the Volunteers in the past two years in their joint efforts with the Korean People's Army in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, defending their homes and country, and safeguarding the cause of peace in Asia and the world.
