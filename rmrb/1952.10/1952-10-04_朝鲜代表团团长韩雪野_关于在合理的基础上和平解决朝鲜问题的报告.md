Respected Delegates:

We gather here today, representing the common will and aspiration of 1.6 billion people in Asia and the Pacific region who oppose war and love peace. The people of the countries that sent us here are expecting us to establish countermeasures for maintaining lasting peace in the Asia-Pacific region with a sincere and earnest attitude and a spirit of friendly consultation in this meeting, so as to eliminate the war suffering and war threats they are suffering.

Based on the initiation of renowned Chinese peace activists, the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was held here in June of this year, and a declaration and resolutions were issued. The people of all countries enthusiastically supported this declaration and resolutions, and with a very cautious attitude, selected us as their representatives. Their expectations of us are so earnest!

Therefore, in this historically significant meeting, we bear a great responsibility not only to the peace-loving people of our own country, but also to the 1.6 billion people in Asia and the Pacific region and the billions of peace-loving and kind people around the world.

In order to restore and maintain peace in the Asia-Pacific region and to prevent the continued prolongation and possible expansion of existing wars of aggression in Asia, we believe that today we must first immediately stop the inhumane bombing and germ warfare crimes being carried out by the US military in Korea, and immediately end the Korean War on a fair and reasonable basis.

The war currently taking place in Korea is an extremely cruel war, unprecedented in human history. If the Korean War is not stopped, no country in the Asia-Pacific region can escape the threat of war.

It is precisely for this reason that the Council of the World Peace Conference, which was held in Berlin in July this year, specifically passed the "Resolution on the Question of Stopping the Korean War" and called on the people of the world to fight together to stop the Korean War.

If we can establish appropriate and effective countermeasures for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question at this meeting, and work together to achieve them, then peace in the Asia-Pacific region can be maintained, and the sincere expectations and great wishes of peace-loving people all over the world can be realized.

Respected Delegates:

The disaster of war imposed on the Korean people has now entered its third year.

This war was imposed on the Korean people by the American aggressors. In the war, the American armed interventionists have turned many cities and villages in Korea into ashes, and destroyed countless cultural facilities such as factories, enterprises, schools, hospitals, churches, and libraries. Countless peaceful residents have suffered inhumane massacres. Especially in areas temporarily occupied by the US military, this massacre of peaceful residents has reached an extremely cruel level.

For example, in the fifty days from October 17 to December 7, 1950, in Sinchon, a county in Hwanghae Province, 35,383 innocent people were massacred, including 16,234 women.

In Pyongyang, they imprisoned more than 4,000 patriotic people, later shooting more than 2,000 of them, and throwing their bodies into twenty-one air-raid shelters, three wells, and three reservoirs.

These are only a small part of the examples. In fact, during the occupation, there was no place where the blood of the Korean people did not flow, and there was no valuable property that was not destroyed or plundered.

The American armed interventionists attempted to conquer the Korean people by means of such massacres, destruction, and looting. However, their estimates were wrong.

Thanks to the heroic struggle of the Korean people, who rose up for the independence, freedom, and honor of their motherland, and the heroic People's Army and their brotherly comrades-in-arms, the Chinese People's Volunteers, the American aggressors not only failed to conquer the Korean people, but also suffered a severe blow. Their killing of peaceful residents only further aroused the infinite anger of the entire Korean people, and also aroused the unanimous opposition of freedom-loving people all over the world.

Under the heavy blows of the Korean people and the pressure of world opinion, the American armed interventionists were forced to begin the Korean armistice negotiations based on the proposal made by Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, last June. Obviously, this armistice negotiation is of great significance in the cause of peacefully resolving the Korean question, restoring peace in Asia, and eliminating the threat of a new world war.

Therefore, the Korean armistice negotiations have become the focus of deep concern and attention not only for the Korean people, but also for peace-loving people all over the world, including the American people, who unanimously hope for a swift end to the Korean War.

However, what has the process of the armistice negotiations, which have been going on for almost one year and three months, shown us?

Obviously, the process of the armistice negotiations shows us that the American ruling clique does not want an armistice, does not want to peacefully resolve the Korean question, but wants to expand the war, and wants to gain in the negotiations what they could not gain in the war.

First, the American representatives participating in the negotiations, from the very beginning, put forward extremely absurd conditions, vainly attempting to force the Korean side to accept them, thereby delaying and sabotaging the negotiations.

For example, during the armistice negotiations on the neutral zone, the American representatives stubbornly insisted on seizing 12,000 square kilometers of territory from the North Korean region, and as a result, the negotiations were delayed for four months.

Secondly, they wanted to interfere in Korea's internal affairs and attempted to prohibit our side from repairing and building airfields. Due to this issue, the negotiations were delayed for another five months.

These two issues were only resolved because of the fair and reasonable proposals and sincere efforts of the Korean-Chinese negotiation delegation, which finally forced them to agree to our side's opinions.

Now, on a fair and reasonable basis, all the clauses of the armistice agreement have been completely agreed upon. The only remaining issue is the repatriation of prisoners of war in accordance with the terms of the agreement and the 1949 Geneva Convention. This means that the armistice negotiations have reached a decisive stage where the armistice agreement can be signed immediately as long as the prisoner-of-war issue is resolved.

However, the American representatives, who originally did not want an armistice, have, from beginning to end, disregarded the solemn provisions of the Geneva Convention and the text of the draft armistice agreement that has already been agreed upon by both sides on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war, attempting to detain a large number of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war indefinitely delaying and sabotaging the negotiations.

Now, regarding the only issue delaying the armistice negotiations—the repatriation of prisoners of war: Article 118 of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, signed in 1949, stipulates that "Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities." Article 51 of the Kaesong draft armistice agreement, which has already been agreed upon between the two sides, also clearly stipulates that "At the time this armistice agreement becomes effective, all prisoners of war on both sides shall be released and repatriated as soon as possible. The release and repatriation of these prisoners of war shall be implemented in accordance with the list exchanged and corrected by both sides before the signing of this armistice agreement." Article 52 also stipulates that both sides must guarantee that prisoners of war will not participate in the Korean War again after being repatriated, so that they can return home to live peaceful lives in accordance with the agreement. Therefore, according to the Geneva Convention and the draft armistice agreement that has already been agreed upon by both sides, all prisoners on both sides should be unconditionally repatriated so that they can return home to live peaceful lives. However, the American representatives disregarded international conventions, and even disregarded Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement that they themselves had already agreed to, and used the so-called "voluntary repatriation" as an excuse, wanting to forcibly detain a large number of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, hand them over to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs, force them to become traitors to their own country, and try to use them as cannon fodder for America's expanded war of aggression.

The American armed interventionists want to rationalize the deceptive phrase of "voluntary repatriation" that they fabricated. They forcibly conduct so-called "screening" and forced "interrogations" of prisoners of war without any basis, forcing or replacing them to press bloody fingerprints on so-called "voluntary repatriation application forms," and branding insulting words or tattoos on the prisoners' bodies. Their harshness and brutality towards prisoners of war are truly unprecedented and indescribable, which has been personally acknowledged by Colonel Colson, the former commander of the American prisoner-of-war camp.

Faced with their unreasonable oppression and abuse, the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war held in American prisoner-of-war camps had no choice but to rise up in resistance, demanding humanitarian treatment in accordance with the Geneva Convention, opposing and protesting forced detention, and firmly demanding repatriation to their respective hometowns.

However, the American generals used even more cruel methods of massacre to respond to these prisoners' legitimate demands.

They beat, tortured, or locked up our prisoners of war who opposed so-called "voluntary repatriation" in steam rooms, suffocating them, or applied electric current to their bodies, causing them to go blind, or unleashed military dogs to bite them fiercely. And under the direct command of the prisoner-of-war camp commander, they mobilized troops to massacre our prisoners of war on a large scale, turning Geoje Island, where the prisoner-of-war camp was located, into a "island of terror," reminding us of "Maidanek" and "Auschwitz."

Regarding this incident, on May 23, the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army held in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp issued an appeal to all the Korean people and the people of the world, requesting assistance to save their lives threatened by death.

Dear friends!

This is the truth about the so-called "voluntary repatriation" manufactured by American generals. On the one hand, they used such violent persecution and massacres to impose their fabricated "voluntary repatriation" on our prisoners of war; on the other hand, in the tents of Panmunjom, they claimed that more than 100,000 of our prisoners of war, including Chinese People's Volunteer prisoners of war, could not be repatriated because they were unwilling to return to their hometowns.

May I ask: If a large number of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war truly refuse repatriation and are willing to remain under the abuse and persecution of the Americans and are willing to be cannon fodder for the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs, then why did General Clark, and others have to directly command armored vehicles, heavy tanks, and flamethrowers in prisoner-of-war camps that were not battlefields, openly using methods of war to attack defenseless Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, successively staging and still staging countless tragic massacres? This fact has revealed without reservation how absurd the "voluntary repatriation" fabricated by the American generals is.

Not only that, the American armed interventionists dared to disregard international laws and human morality, and even used weapons of mass destruction against the people of Korea and China.

Their widespread germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China was prepared for a long time and meticulously. During the period from January 28 to March 11, 1952 alone, the US military headquarters had already dropped bacteriological bombs carrying cholera, typhoid, plague, and other malignant infectious diseases into the vast North Korean areas of six provinces and twenty cities and counties.

Regarding this fact, the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and the investigation team of the International Scientific Committee composed of world-renowned scholars and experts, as well as other peace-loving prominent figures, have conducted several detailed on-site investigations before and after, and have collected irrefutable and conclusive evidence. These have been synthesized into authoritative reports and widely reported to the people of the world. At the same time, due to the timely and effective measures taken by the people of Korea and China, the US military's germ warfare was prevented from achieving their intended purpose.

The American generals were not willing to give up and vainly attempted to force us to submit by using so-called "military pressure." They openly declared that they would conduct devastating bombing of seventy-eight peaceful cities and their peaceful residents in North Korea. In reality, this sinister plan had already been implemented by them several months ago.

They vainly attempted to use such barbaric and destructive methods to break the military stalemate in which they could no longer advance on the front lines, and attempted to use this to force the Korean-Chinese negotiation delegation to submit to their unreasonable demands.

However, facts have proved that the so-called military pressure of the United States has never brought them any benefits. On the contrary, every so-called military pressure has only caused them to suffer greater blows and more losses, while the Korean people have become more determined and more united to fight for survival and independence.

Now, even American generals admit that the attempt to impose unreasonable demands that cannot be achieved in the armistice negotiations on the Korean people by using so-called "military pressure" has gone bankrupt.

Until recently, at the meetings in Panmunjom, they still stubbornly adhered to the bankrupt so-called "voluntary repatriation" principle, playing various threats and sophistry, and even attempting to split and undermine the rock-solid unity of the Korean and Chinese peoples. But all these clumsy tricks have been smashed by the Korean and Chinese sides. Since June 7, the US side has adopted an attitude of refusing consultation and negotiation. Whenever they have no reason to argue and nothing to say, they unreasonably and unilaterally announce recesses. In this way, they have paralyzed the function of the conference, making it easier for them to delay and sabotage the negotiations.

Respected Delegates:

The process by which the American armed interventionists deliberately delayed and sabotaged the armistice negotiations in Korea is roughly like this.

The Korean people have made tremendous efforts to strive for peace in their motherland and the world. At present, the Korean-Chinese side's position on resolving the prisoner-of-war issue has always been based on a fair and reasonable standpoint, believing that prisoners of war on both sides should be reclassified according to nationality and region: all foreign armed personnel captured by both sides, that is, prisoners of war of the United Nations forces or the Chinese People's Volunteers, should be repatriated home; all Korean armed personnel captured by both sides, that is, prisoners of war of the South Korean army or the Korean People's Army, whose homes are in the original side's area, should be repatriated home, and those whose homes are in the area of the side holding them can be allowed to return home locally without being repatriated. Both sides should correct the lists according to this classification principle. This plan not only conforms to the provisions and spirit of the Geneva Convention, but also conforms to Articles 51 and 52 of the armistice agreement already agreed upon by both sides. If the American ruling clique still intends to achieve an armistice in Korea, they have no reason to reject this method.

If the American ruling clique and generals have no sincerity in an armistice and attempt to continue to sabotage the negotiations and expand the war, then the American side should, of course, bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom. This behavior can only arouse the Korean people to fight more heroically and more resolutely. The Korean people are determined to fight to the end for the peace, independence, and unification of their motherland. They clearly know that the arduous struggle they are waging for the independence and freedom of their motherland is a major contribution to the cause of maintaining world peace.

In order to prevent the various sufferings and misfortunes that are falling on the heads of the Korean people today from falling on the heads of the people of other countries tomorrow, it is first necessary to end today's Korean War on a fair and reasonable basis. This is the common aspiration of all peace-loving people in the Asia-Pacific region and hundreds of millions of good people all over the world.

The realization of an armistice is possible only if it is based on fair and reasonable conditions that can restore true peace in Korea. We believe that the following points are concrete ways to end the Korean War and peacefully resolve the Korean question:

First, demand compliance with international law and international practice, especially the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention, and in accordance with the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both sides, fully repatriate prisoners on both sides and quickly realize the Korean armistice.

Second, demand the immediate condemnation and cessation of the destructive germ warfare and destructive bombing of peaceful cities and villages carried out by American interventionists in Korea; and punish the organizers of these crimes as war criminals.

Third, demand that all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, withdraw from Korea after the establishment of the Korean armistice agreement, so that the Korean people can solve their own internal affairs.

I believe that if the above points can be realized, it will not only eliminate the sufferings and misfortunes that the Korean people are suffering today, but also pave the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question and other issues in the Far East; and it will certainly greatly contribute to the cause of maintaining peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world.

For the lasting peace of the Asia-Pacific region, let us unite and fight together!

Peace will surely triumph over war. (Xinhua News Agency)

    朝鲜代表团团长韩雪野
    关于在合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题的报告
    尊敬的诸位代表：
    我们今天在这里聚会，代表着亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民反对战争爱好和平的同一意志与共同愿望。选派我们到这里来的各国人民都在期望着：我们在这个会议里能够以诚恳真挚的态度和友好协商的精神树立维护亚洲及太平洋区域持久和平的各种对策，以消除他们正在遭受着的战争苦难和战争威胁。
    根据中国著名和平战士们的发起，本年六月间曾在这里召开过亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议，并发表了宣言和决议。各国人民非常热烈地拥护了这一宣言和决议，并且以非常慎重的态度，选派我们为他们的代表，他们所期待于我们的是多么殷切啊！
    所以，我们在这有历史意义的会议里，不但对于本国爱好和平的人民，就是对于亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿和全世界亿万爱好和平的善良人民，也负着重大的责任。
    为了恢复和维护亚洲及太平洋区域的和平，制止亚洲现存侵略战争的继续延长与可能扩大的危险，我们认为今天首先就得立即制止正在朝鲜进行着的美军的灭绝人性的轰炸与细菌战的罪行，并在公平合理的基础上立即结束朝鲜战争。
    目前在朝鲜进行着的战争，是人类史上未曾有过的极其残忍的战争。朝鲜战争若不停止，亚洲及太平洋区域的任何国家都不可能由战争的威胁下逃脱出来。
    正是因为这个缘故，所以今年七月在柏林召开的世界和平会议理事会才特别通过了“关于停止朝鲜战争问题的决议”，并号召全世界人民，为停止朝鲜战争而共同斗争。
    我们若能在这个会议里树立关于和平解决朝鲜问题的适当而有效的对策，并共同努力求其实现，那末，亚洲及太平洋区域的和平就有可能保持，而全世界爱好和平的人民所寄托于我们的诚恳期待与巨大愿望也就有可能实现。尊敬的诸位代表：
    朝鲜人民身受的侵略的灾难战争，于今已经是第三个年头了。
    这个战争是美国侵略者强加于朝鲜人民头上的。美国武装干涉者在战争中已把朝鲜的很多城市与乡村化为灰烬，把许许多多的工厂、企业、学校、医院、教堂及图书馆等的文化设施破坏毁灭。无数的和平居民遭受着非人道的屠杀。特别是在美军暂时占领过的地区，这种对于和平居民的屠杀，达到了极其残酷的程度。
    举例来说，在一九五○年十月十七日到十二月七日的五十天期间，仅在黄海道叫做信川的一个郡内，就屠杀了三万五千三百八十三名无辜人民，其中包括有一万六千二百三十四名妇女。
    在平壤，它们又曾监禁了四千多名爱国人民，以后枪毙了其中的两千多名，并把他们的尸首分别扔在二十一个防空洞、三口井和三处贮水池里。
    这些仅不过是很小一部分的例子而已，实际上，在占领期间，没有不流朝鲜人民的鲜血的处所，也没有不被破坏或被抢夺的珍贵财物。
    美国武装干涉者们妄图用这种屠杀、破坏和掠夺的方法来征服朝鲜人民，可是，它们的估计错了。
    由于为了自己祖国的独立、自由与荣誉而奋起的朝鲜人民和英雄的人民军及其兄弟战友中国人民志愿军的英勇斗争，美国侵略者不但没有征服朝鲜人民，反而受到严重的打击，而他们对和平居民的残杀，只有更加激起了全体朝鲜人民的无限愤怒，也引起了全世界爱好自由人民的一致反对。
    在朝鲜人民的沉重打击与世界舆论的压力下，美国武装干涉者被迫根据苏联驻联合国代表马立克去年六月的提议，开始了朝鲜停战谈判。很显然，这个停战谈判在和平解决朝鲜问题、恢复亚洲和平、消除新世界战争威胁等事业上，是有重大意义的。
    所以，朝鲜的停战谈判，不但成了朝鲜人民的、而且是包括美国人民在内的全世界爱好和平人民的深切关心与注目的焦点，他们一致期望迅速结束朝鲜战争。
    可是，已经进行了快一年零三个月的停战谈判的过程，给我们显示了些什么呢？
    很显然，停战谈判的过程给我们显示了：美国统治集团并不想停战，并不想和平解决朝鲜问题，而是在想扩大战争，并想要在谈判中得到在战争中所没能得到的东西。
    第一，参加谈判的美方代表，自从一开始，就提出极端荒谬的条件，妄想强迫朝方接受，这样来拖延和破坏谈判。
    例如：在停战谈判讨论中立区的时候，美方代表竟固执由北朝鲜区域攫取一万二千平方公里的领土，因此，谈判就被拖延了四个月。
    其次，他们要干涉朝鲜的内政，曾企图禁止我方修理和建筑机场。由于这个问题，谈判又被拖延了五个月之久。
    这两个问题，只是由于朝中谈判代表团的公平合理的主张与有诚意的努力，才解除了美方的一切藉口，最后迫使它们不得不同意我方的意见。
    现在，在公平合理的基础之上，停战协定的全部条款也已完全达成了协议。所剩下的问题，仅仅只有一个按照协定条款及一九四九年日内瓦公约遣返战俘的问题。这就是说，停战谈判已经到达了只要这个战俘问题一得到解决，马上就能签订停战协定的决定性的阶段。
    可是，原来就不愿意停战的美方代表们，在遣返战俘的问题上，竟自始至终不顾日内瓦公约的庄严规定和已经双方同意的停战协定草案的条文，企图大量扣留朝中被俘人员，以无限期地拖延谈判，并破坏谈判。
    现在就拖延停战谈判的唯一问题——遣返战俘的问题来讲：一九四九年所签订的关于战俘待遇的日内瓦协定第一百十八条规定着：“实际战事停止后，战俘应即予释放并遣返，不得迟延”。在双方代表之间已经获得协议的开城停战协定草案第五十一条里，也很明白规定着：“本停战协定生效时，所有双方战俘须尽速予以释放并遣返，此项战俘的释放与遣返，须按照本停战协定签字以前，双方所已经交换并校正过的名单实施之。”第五十二条还规定双方须保证战俘被遣返后，不再参加朝鲜战争，以便他们根据协定回家过和平生活。所以，根据日内瓦协定和双方已经获得协议的停战协定草案，是应该无条件地遣返双方的全部俘虏，使他们回家过和平的生活的。可是，美方代表漠视国际公约，甚至也漠视了他们自己所已经同意的停战协定草案第五十一、五十二两款，竟用所谓“自愿遣返”的藉口，想要强迫扣留大量的朝中被俘人员，把他们交给李承晚与蒋介石匪帮，迫使他们成为他们自己祖国的叛徒，并想利用他们作为美国扩大侵略战争的炮灰。
    美国武装干涉者们想把他们自造的“自愿遣返”的欺骗词句合理化起来。对俘虏强迫进行完全没有任何根据的所谓“甄别”与强迫“审讯”，强迫或代替他们在所谓“自愿遣返志愿书”上按上血的指印，并在俘虏身上烙印侮辱性的文字或刺字。他们对待俘虏的苛虐与残暴，真是史无前例，难以形容，而这是美国前俘虏营长官柯尔生所亲笔承认了的。
    对于他们的这种无理压迫与虐待，被收容在美方俘虏营中的朝中被俘人员，不得不起而反抗，要求根据日内瓦公约给予以人道主义的待遇，反对并且抗议强迫扣留，坚决要求遣返各自的家乡。
    可是，美国的将军们，竟用了更残酷的虐杀手段，来答复这些被俘人员的正当要求。
    他们对于反对所谓“自愿遣返”的我方被俘人员，加以殴打、拷询或关进到蒸汽室里，使他们窒息，或把电流通到他们的身上，使他们失明，或使军用犬猛咬他们。并在俘虏营长官的直接指挥下，动员军队，大量屠杀了我方被俘人员，致使俘虏营所在地——巨济岛成为“恐怖之岛”，使我们联想到“麦丹尼克”和“奥斯威辛”。
    关于这一事件，五月二十三日，被收容在巨济岛俘虏营的朝鲜人民军官兵们，曾向全体朝鲜人民和世界人民发出呼吁，要求援助他们，拯救他们受着死亡威胁的生命。亲爱的朋友们！
    美国将军们所制造出来的所谓“自愿遣返”的真相就是这样的。他们一方面用这样横暴的迫害与屠杀，把他们所捏造的“自愿遣返”强加在我方被俘人员的身上；另一方面，在板门店的帐棚里，他们却声言：十万以上的我方被俘人员，包括中国人民志愿军被俘人员在内，因为他们不愿意回到自己的家乡，所以不能遣返。
    试问：假若大量的朝中被俘人员，真是拒绝遣返而愿意留在美国人的虐待与迫害之下，并愿替李承晚和蒋介石匪帮做炮灰的话，那末，为什么像杜德、波纳、甚至所谓联合国军总司令官的克拉克将军，要在不是战场的俘虏营里，直接指挥装甲车、重坦克以及火焰喷射器、公然用战争的方法来攻击手无寸铁的朝中被俘人员，陆续演出了并且还在演出着无数次的屠杀惨剧呢？这一事实已经毫无保留地暴露了：美国将军们所捏造的“自愿遣返”是何等荒谬的谎言。
    不仅如此，美国武装干涉者们竟敢漠视国际法规与人类道德，竟对朝中两国人民使用毁灭人类的细菌武器与化学武器。
    他们在朝鲜和中国东北所广泛进行过的细菌战，是经过长期而周密的准备的。仅在一九五二年的一月二十八日到三月十一日的这一期间，美军司令部已经把带有霍乱、伤寒、鼠疫等恶性传染病菌的细菌弹投到六个道，二十个市郡的广大北朝鲜地区。
    关于这一事实，已有国际民主法律工作者协会调查团和由世界权威的学者、专家组成的国际科学委员会调查团以及其他爱好和平的著名人士们进行了前后数次详密的现地调查，已经搜集到了无可辩驳的确凿的证据。并已把这些综合起来作成了权威性的报告，公开广泛地报道给全世界人民了。同时，由于朝中两国人民采取了及时有效的措施，因而制止了美军的细菌战使之不能达到他们预期的目的。
    美国将军们还不肯甘休，竟妄图用所谓“军事压力”来强迫我们屈服。他们公开声称，要向朝鲜北半部七十八个和平城市和那里的和平居民，进行毁灭性的轰炸。在实际上，这一凶恶计划，在几个月的以前，早已就被他们实施着了。
    他们妄图用这样野蛮的毁灭人类的方法，来打开它们在前线再也不能前进一步的军事僵局，并企图借此来迫使朝中谈判代表团向他们的无理主张屈服。    
    可是，事实证明，美国的所谓军事压力从来也没有为他们讨得便宜。正相反，每一次的所谓军事压力，只有使他们自己遭受更大的打击，更多的损失，而朝鲜人民则反而更加坚决起来，更加团结一致地为生存和独立而斗争。
    现在，连美国将军们也承认：想把在停战谈判中行不通的不合理的要求用所谓“军事压力”来强加于朝鲜人民身上的企图是已经破产了。
    到最近，他们在板门店的会议上，仍然固执已经破产的所谓“自愿遣返”原则，玩弄各种威胁和诡辩，甚至企图分裂和破坏坚如铁石的朝中两国人民的团结。可是所有这些拙劣的伎俩都被朝中方面所粉碎了。自六月七日以来，美方更采取拒绝协商、拒绝谈判的态度，每当他们无理可讲无话可说的时候，他们就无理地片面宣布休会。这样他们就使会议的机能陷于麻木不仁，便于他们拖延和破坏谈判。尊敬的诸位代表：
    美国武装干涉者们在朝鲜故意拖延和破坏停战谈判的过程，大致就是这样的。
    朝鲜人民为了争取他们祖国与全世界的和平，曾作了莫大的努力。目前朝中方面关于解决战俘问题的主张，始终是从公平合理的立场出发，认为双方战俘应依照国籍、地区重新分类，凡双方所俘获的外国武装人员，即联合国军或中国人民志愿军的被俘人员全部遣返回家；双方所俘获的朝鲜武装人员，即南朝鲜军的或朝鲜人民军的被俘人员，其家在原属一方地区者全部遣返回家，其家在收容一方地区者，可以许其就地回家，不必遣返。双方并应根据这个分类原则来校正名单。这个方案既符合日内瓦公约的条文与精神，又合乎双方已经协议的停战协定第五十一和第五十二两款。美国统治集团如果尚有意于在朝鲜实现停战，他们就没有理由拒绝这个办法。
    如果美国统治集团和将军们对停战毫无诚意而企图继续破坏谈判、扩大战争的话，那么由此而产生的一切后果，当然应由美国方面负完全责任；他们这种行为，只能引起朝鲜人民更加英勇、更加坚决地斗争。朝鲜人民是一定要为他们祖国的和平与独立、统一而奋斗到底的。他们清楚地知道：他们为了自己祖国的独立与自由所进行着的艰苦斗争，对于维护世界和平的事业是一个重大的贡献。
    为了使今天落在朝鲜人民头上的各种苦难与不幸，明天不落到其他国家人民的头上去，首先要在公平合理的基础上结束今天的朝鲜战争。这是爱好和平的全体亚洲及太平洋区域人民和全世界数亿万善良人们的共同愿望。
    实现停战只有以能在朝鲜恢复真正和平的公平合理的条件为基础，才是可能的。我们认为，下面几点是结束朝鲜战争、和平解决朝鲜问题的具体办法。
    第一、要求遵守国际法与国际惯例，特别是一九四九年日内瓦公约的规定，并根据双方已经达成协议的停战协定草案，全部遣返双方俘虏，迅速实现朝鲜停战。
    第二、要求立即谴责和制止美国干涉者在朝鲜所进行的毁灭人类的细菌战和对和平城市与乡村的破坏性的滥炸；并对于这些罪行的组织者，以战争罪犯的惩处。
    第三、要求一切外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军，在朝鲜停战协定成立后，从朝鲜撤走，让朝鲜人民自己来解决朝鲜自己的内政问题。
    我相信：亲爱的诸位代表，如能够实现以上几点的话，那就不但能够消除今天朝鲜人民所正遭受着的苦难与不幸，并能为和平解决朝鲜问题及远东其他问题开辟道路；进而也一定大大有助于维护亚洲及太平洋区域和全世界和平的事业。
    为了亚洲及太平洋区域的持久和平，让我们一致团结起来，共同奋斗吧！
    和平一定能够战胜战争。  （新华社）
