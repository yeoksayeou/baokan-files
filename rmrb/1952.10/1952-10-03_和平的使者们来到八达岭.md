    Envoys of Peace Visit Badaling
    By our reporter Bai Sheng

    It was a clear autumn morning. Golden sunlight shone on the earth, illuminating the peace city of new China – Beijing – on which people all over the world are focused. A train carrying envoys of peace – the delegates attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference – sped from Beijing East Station directly towards the historically significant peak of the Great Wall – Badaling.

    Inside the carriages sat peace delegates from dozens of countries. There were delegates from the Soviet Union, as well as representatives of the American people; delegates from Korea, as well as delegates from China; and representatives of the people from countries like Japan, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Turkey. Although their skin colors and languages differed, everyone shared a common belief – to defend peace. Representatives from many countries were chatting amicably with the Chinese translators about the situation in new China. They felt boundless joy and gratification at the ever-increasing strength of the Chinese people in defending peace. In carriage 405, in a seat on the right-hand side, sat the famous Turkish poet, the outstanding peace fighter, Hikmet. This peace fighter, who had suffered torture at the hands of fascists and spent more than ten years in prison and four years of intermittent imprisonment, possessed a strong will to defeat the enemies of peace. From the poet's fervent words, I deeply felt his profound affection for the Chinese people.

    At 11:50 a.m., the train stopped at Qinglongqiao Station. The delegates disembarked here to climb and advance towards Badaling. They slowly stepped onto the stone steps of the Great Wall.

    Chinese delegates Burhan Shahidi and Xiao San accompanied the Turkish poet Hikmet at the rear. In the distance, people could already see the peace delegates standing on the ridge and looking out, and they could also hear their cheerful laughter. This peace fighter, whose legs were afflicted with rheumatism due to the torture of fascist bandits, was in such high spirits today. He seemed to have forgotten the pain in his legs, and, leaning on a cane recently purchased from the Summer Palace, he slowly climbed towards the ridge, beads of sweat appearing on his forehead. His companions urged him to rest for a while, but the poet continued to move forward with difficulty. He said he did not feel tired, and, smiling, told the poet Xiao San: those at the back must catch up! Burhan and Xiao San both wanted to find him a donkey to ride, but he laughed and said: a small donkey could not withstand the weight of his tall frame. Some of the delegates, although nearing seventy years of age, were able to climb towards the ridge with vigorous steps.

    On the city gate were written the large white and red characters "Long Live the Great Solidarity of the Asian People" and "Long Live the Great People's Republic of China." The delegates pointed to these characters and asked the Chinese comrades with concern what they meant. Many delegates, gazing at the Great Wall winding and stretching across the mountain peaks, praised the greatness of the engineering. The American delegate Mrs. Sirls called this tour a happy trip. She believed that it was a rare thing for people speaking different languages to be able to gather together and chat. She happily opened her handbook and wrote down her thoughts. She said to her Chinese friends with emotion: I am truly unspeakably excited to be able to take a happy trip on the land of new China today. I am especially happy about the arrival of the Turkish poet Hikmet; I believe he will surely write this beautiful scene into a beautiful poem. It will become an important document in the struggle to defend world peace. During the conversation, she couldn't help but think of the outstanding American peace fighter, the black singer Robeson. She said with emotion: if Robeson were here today, he would surely stand on this ancient Great Wall and sing loudly, singing of human peace.

    On the ridge, delegates from Australia, New Zealand, India, the Soviet Union, Ceylon, Canada, and many other countries sang the songs of peace enthusiastically in different languages.

    Heroically breaking through the obstruction of the American government and the Japanese Yoshida government, the Japanese delegate Hiroki Kojima, standing on a corner of the Great Wall, said with deep emotion: As soon as I saw this ancient Great Wall, it made me think of those years when Japanese warlords invaded the Chinese people. I feel very ashamed that the Japanese people were not able to prevent the Japanese warlords from invading China back then. Today, the Japanese people are suffering from the invasion of American imperialism and living a life of suffering. But the victory of the Chinese people has given him great encouragement, making him believe that the Japanese people's struggle against American imperialists will surely be victorious.

    On the peak of Badaling, the Korean delegate, the famous artist and film actor Mun Ye-bong, warmly shook hands with Amador, the delegate from Honduras in South America. Amador said to Mun Ye-bong kindly: The people of Honduras also want to drive out the aggressive forces of American imperialism. Mun Ye-bong said excitedly: The American imperialist aggressors are the enemies of peace. They are frantically attacking my motherland. As a peace-loving Korean art worker, I cannot but appeal to the people of the world on behalf of the peace-loving Korean people. There is no happiness in the places where the American imperialist aggressors have passed. I hope that the people of our two countries will fight together to drive out the aggressive forces of American imperialism.

    On the way down the mountain, many Indian delegates, because it was inconvenient to wear shoes to go down the mountain, took off their shoes and walked down carrying them; the older delegates did not feel tired at all. At the moment of resting at Qinglongqiao Station, on the grass next to the station, the delegates talked to each other. The American delegate Louis Suzuki and several Japanese delegates talked in Japanese. In a chair beside the railway, Hikmet received international friends who came to express their condolences to him. This was a moving picture full of internationalist friendship.

    On the returning train, the Japanese delegate Kiyoshi Ozawa excitedly asked the Chinese comrades to sing a song. This request was immediately accepted, and the Chinese comrades sang "The Hearts of the People of the World Are One." Then representatives from the United States, India, Costa Rica, the Soviet Union, Colombia, and other countries all ran to the microphone and sang songs of peace. Mrs. Bard of India even sang the folk songs loved by the Indian people twice with enthusiasm. Finally, the Indian poet Patnaik recited a beautiful poem he had written on the train with the emotion of a poet, praising friendship:

    How kind! How kind,
    The people of new China,
    How wonderful, how intimate it is to be with you,………………
    I will never forget it.
    I hope to be with you again and again.

    和平的使者们来到八达岭
    本报记者  柏生
    是一个晴朗的秋天的早晨。金色的阳光照耀着大地，照耀着全世界人民注目的和平城市——新中国的北京。一列火车载着和平使者——出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表，由北京东车站直向富有历史意义的万里长城的高峰——八达岭驰去。
    车箱里，坐着来自数十个国家的和平代表。这里有苏联的代表，也有美国人民的代表，有朝鲜的代表，有中国的代表，也有日本、印度、澳大利亚、新西兰、土耳其等国人民的代表，虽然肤色不同，语言不同，但大家都有着一个共同的信念——保卫和平。许多国家的代表在和中国的翻译人员亲切地谈着新中国的情况，他们对中国人民的日益增长着的保卫和平的力量，感到无限的喜悦和欣慰。在四○五号的车箱里，靠右边正中的一个座位上，坐着著名的土耳其的诗人、杰出的和平战士希克梅特。这位曾经遭受过法西斯的拷问和度过十余年监禁和四年断续坐狱生活的和平战士，具有着战胜和平的敌人的坚强意志。从诗人火热般的话语里，我深深地感到他对中国人民的深厚的感情。
    上午十一时五十分，列车在青龙桥车站停下来了。代表们都从这里下车去登高，向着八达岭前进。他们慢慢地踏上了万里长城的石阶。
    中国代表鲍尔汉和萧三陪着土耳其诗人希克梅特走在最后面。远远地，人们已经可以看到站在岭上眺望的和平代表们，也可以听到他们的愉快的笑声。这个被法西斯强盗折磨得双腿患了风湿症的和平战士，今天兴致是这样的高，他像是忘记了自己腿上的痛苦，拄着一支新近才由万寿山买来的拐杖，缓步往岭上攀登，他的额头上冒出了汗珠。和他同行的朋友们都要求他休息一下，但诗人依然吃力地向前行进着。他说他没有感到疲劳，笑着和诗人萧三说：走在最后面的要迎头赶上去呢。鲍尔汉、萧三都想给他弄个毛驴来骑，他却笑着说：小小的毛驴是经不起他那高大身躯的重压的呵。有些代表的年纪虽然已近古稀，但都能以矫健的步子登向岭上。
    城关上写着“亚洲人民大团结万岁”“伟大的中华人民共和国万岁”两行白色和红色的大字。代表们指着这些大字关心地问着中国的同志们这是什么意思。许多代表望着在山巅蜿蜒伸展开去的长城，赞叹这工程的伟大。美国代表塞尔奈夫人把这次游览称作幸福的旅行，她认为：操着各种不同的语言的人能在一起欢聚倾谈，是一件难得的事。她愉快地翻开手册写下了自己的感想。她感动地对中国朋友说：今天我能在新中国的土地上作一次幸福的旅行，心里真有说不出的兴奋。土耳其诗人希克梅特的来到，尤其使我高兴；我相信他一定会把这美好的情景，写成一首美丽的诗篇。它将成为保卫世界和平斗争中的一个重要文献。谈话间她不禁想起了美国人民杰出的和平战士、黑人歌唱家罗伯逊来，她感慨地说：如果罗伯逊今天也在这里，他一定会站在这古老的长城上引吭高歌，歌唱人类的和平。
    在岭上，澳大利亚、新西兰、印度、苏联、锡兰、加拿大等许多国家的代表，一齐用着不同的语言，热情地歌唱着和平之歌。
    英勇地突破美国政府和日本吉田政府的阻挠，来到新中国的日本代表儿岛博基站在长城的一角上感慨万端地说：一看见这古老的长城，就使我想到当年日本军阀侵略中国人民的那些岁月。我感觉到非常惭愧，当年日本人民没有能够防止日本军阀对中国的侵略。今天，日本人民正遭受着美帝国主义的侵略，过着痛苦的生活。但是中国人民的胜利给了他很大的鼓舞，使他相信日本人民对美帝国主义者的斗争是一定会取得胜利的。
    在八达岭的高峰上，朝鲜代表、著名的艺术家、电影演员文艺峰和南美洲洪都拉斯的代表阿马多尔热情地握着手。阿马多尔亲切地对文艺峰说：洪都拉斯人民也要赶走美帝国主义侵略势力。文艺峰激动地说：美帝国主义侵略者是和平的敌人，它向我的祖国疯狂进攻，做为一个爱好和平的朝鲜艺术工作者，我不能不代表爱好和平的朝鲜人民向全世界人民呼吁。美帝国主义侵略者所走过的地方是没有幸福的。我希望我们两国人民共同为赶走美帝国主义的侵略势力而斗争。
    在下山的路上，许多印度代表因为穿着鞋子下山不方便，他们都把鞋子脱了下来，提着鞋子往下走；年纪大的代表，也毫没感觉疲倦。在回到青龙桥车站休息的时刻，在车站旁边的草地上，代表们互相倾谈着，美国代表路易斯·铃木和几个日本代表用日语交谈着。在铁道旁的一只椅子上，希克梅特接待着前来向他慰问的国际友人。这是一幅洋溢着国际主义友爱的动人的图画。
    在归来的火车上，日本代表小泽清兴奋地要求中国同志唱一支歌。这个要求立刻被接受了，中国同志歌唱起“全世界人民心一条”。接着美国、印度、哥斯达黎加、苏联、哥伦比亚等国家的代表，都跑到扩音器前高唱着和平的歌声。印度的巴德女士更热情地两次唱出了印度人民爱好的民歌。最后，印度的诗人帕特奈克用诗人的感情朗诵了他在火车上写成的一首歌颂友谊的美丽诗篇：
    亲切啊！多么亲切，
    新中国的人民，
    和你们在一起是多么美好，多么亲密，………………
    我将永远不能忘记。
    希望一次一次再一次，和你们在一起。
