    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, after four months of intense preparation, is about to open today in the capital of New China. This signifies the growing awakening of 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions and their urgent common desire to unite and defend peace. Representatives of the people from various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions have come to Beijing to participate in this peace conference. Attending the conference are representatives from six international organizations: the World Peace Council, the World Federation of Trade Unions and its Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau, The Women’s International Democratic Foundation, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and the International Union of Students, as well as representatives from countries such as Britain, France, Brazil, and Algeria, and several specially invited guests. This more fully demonstrates that the people of Asia and the Pacific region, as well as countries all over the world, place boundless expectations on this peace conference.

    The reason why people all over the world attach such great importance to this peace conference is because the Asian and Pacific region is facing severe war disasters and threats of war today. The American aggressors are delaying and sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations, using large-scale human-slaughtering bacteriological and chemical weapons and napalm bombs, and massively bombing peaceful cities, peaceful facilities, and peaceful residents in Korea. They blatantly disregard the firm opposition of the Japanese people and the people of the world, reviving the forces of Japanese militarism, attempting to use militarist Japan as a tool for new wars of aggression; they are massively expanding military aggression bases in various places, forcing many countries to conclude aggressive military agreements, and plotting to organize a Pacific Group with Japan as its core; they incite racial discrimination, provoke national conflicts and religious disputes, and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, endangering their sovereignty, and suppressing the national independence movements of various small and weak countries. This seriously threatens the peace and security of the Asian and Pacific region. How to stop such disasters and threats of aggressive war has become a realistic issue that every good person in the Asian and Pacific region must consider. The people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific region deeply hate war and yearn for a peaceful, free, independent, and happy life. The lofty task of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is to further mobilize and organize the forces of the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions to jointly defend peace and security, enhance friendly relations between the people of all countries, and avoid war disasters and threats of war. Convening this peace conference is an action taken on behalf of the common aspirations of 1.6 billion peace-loving people. Undoubtedly, this conference will play a huge role in mobilizing and encouraging the common struggle of 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific region for the common cause of opposing war and defending peace.

    Faced with the serious war threats instigated and provoked by the American aggressors, the most realistic task for the people of our countries in the Asian and Pacific region is to rapidly strengthen the unity among the people of all countries and mobilize all the people of all countries to take active action and participate in the great struggle to defend peace and oppose the threat of war. Only when the people of all countries further unite and act in unison can we repel the threat of war and ensure peace in the Asian and Pacific region and the world. Therefore, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is also a conference for further uniting the people of our countries. It marks a new historical stage in the development of the peace movement in the Asian and Pacific region. That is, the forces of the individual struggles of the people of various countries to defend peace will inevitably converge through this peace conference, take unified action, and become a great force in the struggle for peace in the Asian and Pacific region. The reason why this peace conference is so fully representative and the number of countries attending the conference is so enthusiastic shows that the people of all countries have an urgent desire to further unite. Because in the actual struggle for peace, the people of all countries have deeply realized that only by further uniting the forces of the people of all countries can the actual actions of the struggle for peace have a greater effect and can we defeat all the provocations and sabotage schemes of the enemies of peace. We firmly believe that the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is a good start for further strengthening the unity of the people of all countries. Through this peace conference, exchanging opinions on defending peace and gaining a more thorough understanding of each other will surely more effectively promote unity and friendly cooperation between countries and mobilize and organize a broader force for defending peace. All peace-loving people in our countries in the Asian and Pacific region, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, national differences, or occupational categories, should unite as one. The basis of our unity is to establish friendly relations of peaceful coexistence, equal exchange, mutually beneficial trade, and cultural exchange between countries and nations with different political systems. The stronger our unity, the more we all place the common interests of peace in the first place, the more peace will be guaranteed, and all the conspiracies and tricks of the enemies of peace will fail.

    We, the Chinese people, have always loved peace. We have long suffered the pain of the Japanese militarist war of aggression and the Kuomintang bandit counter-revolutionary war supported by the United States, and we deeply hate war. Today, we need to build our independent, free, and happy motherland, make our country more prosperous and strong, and improve the people's lives. We want to make our country richer and stronger, but we cannot and should not plunder the interests of other countries' people like American imperialism. Instead, we must rely on developing our own production and construction. To carry out large-scale peaceful economic construction, we must have a peaceful international environment so that our construction work will not be threatened by war and so that the fruits of our labor will not be destroyed by war again. Therefore, striving for lasting peace in the Asian and Pacific region and the world is the sincere desire of the Chinese people. The Chinese people sending their volunteer army to fight in Korea is also to help the Korean people resist aggression, to strike at the threat of the American aggressors to our peace and security, and to defend peace in the Asian and Pacific region. The Chinese people have a firm will and powerful strength to defend peace. We do not want to invade anyone, and we will never allow any aggressor to move even a single blade of grass on our land!

    The Chinese people firmly believe that countries with different political systems can coexist peacefully. We, like all peace-loving people in Asia, the Pacific region, and the world, advocate developing trade and commerce between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, establishing cultural exchange relations, and promoting mutual understanding, mutual trust, and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries. We advocate concluding a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, withdrawing all foreign troops from Japan, and resolutely preventing the revival of Japanese militarist forces. We advocate achieving an immediate ceasefire in Korea on a fair and reasonable basis. We advocate universal disarmament and the prohibition of the production and use of chemical, bacteriological, and atomic weapons that violate international law. We advocate that the five major powers sign a peace pact and resolve all international disputes through peaceful consultation. These proposals are in line with the common interests of the people of Asia, the Pacific region, and the world, and reflect the common aspirations and demands of hundreds of millions of good people. We, the Chinese people, are willing to unite with the people of Asia, the Pacific region, and the world to jointly take on the cause of striving for and defending peace. We are willing to contribute our strength to this common cause and fight to the end to realize the above proposals.

    On the occasion of the opening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, we sincerely wish this peace conference a brilliant victory!

    进一步团结起来打退战争威胁保卫和平
    ——祝亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议胜利开幕
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，经过四个月的紧张筹备，今天就要在新中国的首都开幕了。这标志着亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民的日益觉醒，迫切要求团结起来保卫和平的共同愿望。现在到北京来参加这个和平会议的，有亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的代表，列席这个会议的有世界和平理事会、世界工会联合会及其亚澳联络局、国际民主妇女联合会、国际民主法律工作者协会、国际学生联合会等六个国际团体，英国、法国、巴西、阿尔及利亚等国家的代表，和若干特邀人士。这更充分地表明了亚洲和太平洋区域以及全世界各国的人民，都对这个和平会议寄予了无限的期望。
    全世界人民所以极端重视这个和平会议，是因为今天亚洲及太平洋区域面临着严重的战争灾难和战争威胁。美国侵略者正在拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，使用大规模屠杀人类的细菌武器、化学武器和凝固汽油弹，大规模轰炸朝鲜的和平城市、和平设施及和平居民；公然不顾日本人民和全世界人民的坚决反对，把日本军国主义势力复活起来，企图利用军国主义的日本作为新的侵略战争的工具；在各地大量扩充军事侵略基地，强迫许多国家缔结侵略性军事协定，并阴谋组织以日本为核心的太平洋集团；煽动种族歧视，挑拨民族冲突和宗教纠纷，并干涉别国内政，危害别国主权，镇压各弱小国家的民族独立运动。这就严重地威胁着亚洲及太平洋区域的和平与安全。怎样制止这种侵略战争的灾害和威胁，已经成为亚洲及太平洋区域每一个善良人民所要考虑的现实问题了。亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民深深地憎恨战争，渴望着和平、自由、独立和幸福的生活。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的崇高任务，就是要把亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的力量，进一步动员和组织起来，共同保卫和平与安全，增进各国人民间的友好关系，避免战争灾难与战争威胁。召开这个和平会议就是代表十六亿和平人民的共同愿望所采取的行动。无疑的，这次会议对于亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民为反对战争、保卫和平的共同事业而进行的共同斗争，将要起巨大的动员和鼓舞的作用。
    面对着美国侵略者所策动和挑拨的严重的战争威胁，我们亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民最现实的任务，是迅速加强各国人民间的团结，动员各国一切人民积极行动起来，参加保卫和平、反对战争威胁的伟大斗争。只有各国人民进一步团结并一致行动起来，才能打退战争的威胁，确保亚洲和太平洋区域以及全世界的和平。因此，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，也就是我们各国人民进一步团结的会议。它标志着亚洲及太平洋区域的和平运动，从此走上了一个新的历史发展阶段。这就是各国人民分别进行的保卫和平斗争的力量，通过这个和平会议必能汇集起来，采取一致的行动，成为亚洲及太平洋区域争取和平斗争的伟大力量。这个和平会议之所以具有这样充分的代表性，出席会议的国家这样踊跃，正说明了各国人民已经迫切地要求进一步团结起来的愿望。因为各国人民在争取和平的实际斗争中，已经深刻地认识到，只有把各国人民的力量进一步团结起来，才能使争取和平斗争的实际行动发挥更大的效果，才能够战胜和平的敌人的一切挑拨和破坏阴谋。我们深信，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，是各国人民进一步加强团结的良好开端，通过这个和平会议，互相交换了保卫和平的意见，彼此获得更充分的了解，必能更有效地促进各国间的团结与友好合作，动员和组织更广大的保卫和平的力量。我们亚洲及太平洋区域各国一切爱好和平的人民，不分政治见解、宗教信仰、民族差别和职业种类，都应该一致团结起来。我们团结的基础就是在不同政治制度的国家和民族之间，建立和平相处，平等往来，互利通商，文化交流的友好关系。我们团结得越坚强，我们大家都把共同的和平利益放在首要的地位，和平就会更有保障，和平的敌人的一切阴谋诡计都会无法得逞。
    我们中国人民，是一贯爱好和平的。我们曾长期遭受日本军国主义侵略战争、美国支持下的国民党匪帮反革命战争的痛苦，深切地痛恨战争。我们今天更需要建设我们独立、自由、幸福的祖国，使我们的国家更繁荣强盛，使人民生活更加改善。我们要使我们的国家变得更富足和强盛，但是我们不能也不应该像美帝国主义那样去掠夺别国人民的利益，而是必须依靠发展自己的生产建设事业。要进行大规模的和平经济建设，必须有一个和平的国际环境，才能使我们的建设工作不会受到战争的威胁，才能使我们的劳动成果不会再遭受到战争的破坏。因此，争取亚洲和太平洋区域以及全世界的持久和平，是我们中国人民的衷心愿望。中国人民派遣自己的志愿军到朝鲜作战，也就是援助朝鲜人民抵抗侵略，打击美国侵略者对我国和平与安全的威胁，保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平。中国人民对保卫和平具有坚定的意志和强大的力量，我们不欲侵略任何人，也决不让任何侵略者动我们一草一木！
    中国人民坚定地认为，不同政治制度的国家是可以和平相处的。我们和亚洲、太平洋区域及世界各国一切爱好和平人民一样，主张在平等互利的基础上，发展各国通商贸易，建立文化交流关系，促进各国人民互相了解，互相信任和友好合作。我们主张缔结全面的对日和约，从日本撤退一切外国军队，坚决制止日本军国主义势力的复活。我们主张在公平合理的基础上立即实现朝鲜停战。我们主张普遍裁减军备，并禁止生产和使用违反国际公法的化学武器、细菌武器和原子武器。我们主张五大国签订和平公约，并用和平协商的方法解决国际间的一切纠纷。这些主张是符合亚洲、太平洋区域和全世界人民的共同利益的，是反映了亿万善良人民的共同愿望和要求的。我们中国人民，愿和亚洲、太平洋区域及全世界人民团结一致，共同把争取和保卫和平的事业担当起来。我们愿意在这一共同事业中贡献我们的力量，为实现上述主张而奋斗到底。
    当此亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议开幕之日，我们衷心地祝贺这个和平会议获得光辉的胜利！
