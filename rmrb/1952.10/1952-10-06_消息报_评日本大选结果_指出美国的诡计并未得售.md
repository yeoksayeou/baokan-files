    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 5th: Kudryavtsev, in an article in "Izvestia," commented on the results of the Japanese House of Representatives election. He first reminded readers that Yoshida, at the behest of the Americans, dissolved the House of Representatives in August and announced preparations for a new election, hoping to consolidate the Liberal Party's position in the Diet. This was intended to enable the Diet to approve plans for accelerated rearmament and agree to amend the 1947 Constitution, which prohibits Japan from maintaining armed forces and declares that Japan will no longer use war as a means of resolving international disputes. To enable the Liberal Party to secure a majority of seats in the Diet, the Yoshida government, at the behest of the American authorities, passed a new election law that prevented democratic parties and groups from conducting smooth election campaigns. The Liberal Party received large sums of money from Japanese capitalists, and thus engaged in large-scale bribery during the election. The Liberal Party ranked first in the number of cases of violating election laws, committing a total of 456 documented cases. At the same time, Yoshida's Liberal Party government adopted police terror against the Communist Party and various democratic groups, obstructing their election activities and arresting their activists.

    Kudryavtsev pointed out that the American imperialists wanted to make people believe that the policy of rearming Japan was supported by the public, and therefore they attempted to launch an election campaign under the slogan of rearmament, making people think that this slogan was the demand of the voters.

    But this American trick did not succeed. Faced with a strong nationwide movement for peace and democracy, none of the representatives of the reactionary parties—including Liberal Party leader Yoshida and Progressive Party leader and war criminal Shigemitsu Mamoru—dared to openly advocate rearming Japan.

    Kudryavtsev continued, from this perspective, the Liberal Party's electoral "victory" in winning slightly more than half of the seats in the House of Representatives is very relative. The Liberal Party that emerged after the election was not stronger than those who planned the dissolution of the Diet had hoped, but rather weaker. First, the Liberal Party lost about 45 seats. Second, the party has been weakened by the struggle for leadership between the Yoshida faction and the Hatoyama faction. Most of the new seats—35—were won by left-wing socialists, who in some constituencies were supported by groups in favor of establishing a national liberation democratic united front initiated by the Japanese Communist Party.

    Kudryavtsev concluded: Thus, the early Japanese election failed to meet the hopes of those who planned it.

    “消息报”评日本大选结果
    指出美国的诡计并未得售
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：库德里雅夫采夫在“消息报”撰文评论日本国会众议院选举结果。他首先提醒读者说，吉田在八月间奉美国人之命解散众议院，宣布准备举行新的选举，希望借此巩固自由党在国会中的地位，从而使国会批准加速重新武装的计划，同意修改一九四七年的宪法。这个宪法禁止日本保有武装部队，并宣称日本不再以战争作为解决国际纠纷的办法。为了使自由党能够在国会中获得多数席次，吉田政府奉美国当局之命通过了一项新的选举法，这个选举法使各民主党派和团体不能顺利进行竞选活动。自由党从日本资本家那里得到大量金钱，于是在竞选中就大事贿赂。在破坏选举法的案件的数目方面，自由党人占第一位，他们共犯了四百五十六件有案可查的破坏选举法的案件。同时，吉田的自由党政府对共产党和各民主团体采取警察恐怖行动，阻挠它们的选举活动，逮捕它们的活动分子。
    库德里雅夫采夫指出：美帝国主义者想使人们相信重新武装日本的政策是得到公众的支持的，因此他们企图在重新武装的口号下展开选举运动，使人们以为这个口号是选民的要求。
    但是美国的这种诡计并未得售。在强大的全国规模的争取和平与民主的运动面前，反动党派的代表——包括自由党领袖吉田和改进党领袖战犯重光葵在内——没有一个人敢于公开主张重新武装日本。
    库德里雅夫采夫继续写道，从这方面看来，自由党在国会众议院中获得半数略多的席次的选举“胜利”是很相对的。在选举后出现的自由党不但不比那些策划解散国会的人所指望的来得强大，反而更加衰弱了。第一，自由党失去了约四十五席。第二，该党已被吉田派与鸠山派争夺领导权的斗争削弱了。大部分的新席次——三十五席——为左派社会党人所赢得，他们在若干选区中受到赞成建立由日本共产党倡议的民族解放民主统一阵线的团体的支持。
    库德里雅夫采夫在结语中说：这样看来，这次提前举行的日本大选并未能满足策划这次选举的人的希望。
