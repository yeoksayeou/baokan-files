    The Third Anniversary of the Founding of New China
    Huang Yanpei
    (I)
    New China has been established for three years,
    I talked with the farmers: "Good,
    Every farmer's family has land,"
    "And no worries about food or clothing." The workers
    Have cultural palaces,
    Have clubs,
    Have sanatoriums. Everyone happily:
    Produce!
    Produce!
    Work hard to produce!
    Many advanced experiences have been promoted. The construction of New China has begun,
    The political construction has consolidated the people's democratic united front,
    The economic construction, to complete industrialization,
    Still needs ten or twenty years of effort.
    (II)
    Three years is not a long time,
    The People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao,
    Completely and thoroughly liberated the entire Chinese mainland,
    All the way to Tibet. So many different nationalities,
    Living in a warm big family,
    Like brothers; The People's Liberation Army,
    Does not take credit, does not act tough, but wishes to be the pillar of the world peace edifice.
    First protecting Asia,
    Protecting the Pacific, how glorious is the holding of a fair and just peace conference!
    The alliance and mutual assistance between the two major countries, China and the Soviet Union, is inseparable,
    Who is my friend? Who is my enemy?
    My friend needs "aid";
    My enemy needs "resistance". How sharp are the eyes of the people of New China!
    Along streets and alleys, teams of children are singing loudly:
    "Valiant and high-spirited!
    Heads held high!
    Crossing the Yalu River."
    (III)
    All within these three years:
    Prices have stabilized,
    Finance has stabilized,
    First, the three major movements were successful; then the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements,
    Swept away the social evils of thousands of years; With the rapid literacy method,
    There are no more illiterates; The incidence of disease and mortality rates have begun to decrease,
    In order to launch the patriotic health campaign; Seventy-five days of "Jingjiang Diversion";
    The "Tianlan" on the Longhai Railway,
    The "Chengyu" on the Sichuan Railway,
    In a short period, all roads are open.
    What do we rely on? I have the masses,
    Truman planned in his mind,
    I also have,
    What do I have?
    Rats, fleas,
    Bedbugs, black flies,
    Mosquitoes.
    (IV)
    New China,
    Three years, in these three years,
    The greatest is ideological remolding, young people!
    Women! Educators!
    Literary and art workers! General workers!
    All departments, all levels,
    Some are changing—some have already changed—
    Their new minds. Private industrialists and businessmen still need to,
    Must pay attention to the interests of the state,
    The interests of the workers. Just planning for one's own interests,
    This calculation is too small. Individualism,
    Liberalism, selfishness,
    These are all corrupt things. A high degree of patriotism,
    Must be combined with internationalism, for the sake of the country,
    For the sake of the people,
    Is the overall indicator of everything. The sixty articles of the Common Program stipulated by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,
    Is the general call. Ideological remolding,
    Will manifest itself in the remolding of behavior, and together move towards the bright road of socialism.

    新中国成立三周年
    黄炎培
    （一）
    新中国成立了三周年，
    我和农民们谈天：“好了，
    每一个农家，有的是田，”
    “也不愁吃，也不愁穿。”工人们，
    有文化宫，
    有俱乐部，
    有疗养院。大家高高兴兴地：
    生产！
    生产！
    努力生产！
    推广了不少先进经验。新中国建设开始了，
    政治的建设，巩固了人民民主统一战线，
    经济的建设，要工业化完成，
    还得努力十年、二十年。
    （二）
    三年的时间不算长，
    人民解放军，在中国共产党、毛主席领导下，
    把中华整个大陆完完全全地解放，
    一直解放到西藏。多少不同的民族，
    生活在温暖的大家庭中间，
    和弟兄一样；人民解放军，
    不居功，不逞强，但愿做世界和平大厦的栋梁。
    首先保卫着亚洲，
    保卫着太平洋，堂堂正正和平会议的召开，多么辉煌！中苏两大国间同盟互助是不可分的了，
    谁是我的友？谁是我的敌？
    我的友要“援”；
    我的敌要“抗”。新中国人民的眼光多么雪亮！
    一条条街巷，一队队儿童在高声唱：
    “雄赳赳！
    气昂昂！
    跨过鸭绿江。”
    （三）
    都在这三年当中：
    物价稳定了，
    财政稳定了，
    首先是三大运动成功；接着三反五反运动，
    扫荡了千百年来社会的恶风；有了速成识字法，
    就没有了文盲；发病率、死亡率开始降低了，
    为的是展开了爱国卫生运动；七十五天“荆江分洪”；
    陇海铁路上的“天兰”，
    四川铁路上的“成渝”，
    短短的期间，路路皆通。
    靠的是什么？我有群众，
    杜鲁门在心头打算了，
    我也有，
    有什么？
    老鼠，跳蚤，
    壁虱，黑蝇，
    蚊虫。
    （四）
    新中国，
    三年了，这三年中间，
    最伟大是思想改造，青年们！
    妇女们！教育工作者们！
    文艺工作者们！一般工作者们！
    各部门，各阶层，
    有的正在变换着——有的已经变换了——
    他们的新的头脑。私营工商业家还是要，
    必须注意到国家的利益，
    工人的利益。光是打算自身利益，
    这个算盘太小。个人主义，
    自由主义，自私自利，
    这些、都是腐朽的一套。高度的爱国主义，
    必须结合了国际主义才好，为的是国家，
    为的是人民，
    是一切一切总的指标。人民政协规定下来的共同纲领六十条，
    是总的号召。思想改造了，
    会表现出行为的改造，一齐趋向着社会主义光明大道。
    一九五二年九月二十五日
