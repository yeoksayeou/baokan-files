    Cheer for the Achievements of the Motherland's People in the Past Three Years
    Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party Central Committee
    Chen Qiyou
    The great festival of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China has arrived! In this great festival, let us cheer for the brilliant achievements of the people of the motherland in the past three years!
    Because the Chinese and Korean troops continued to fight in Korea and achieve constant victories, U.S. imperialism was forced to accept armistice negotiations. However, unwilling to admit defeat, they continued to use base and shameless means to slaughter prisoners of war and use bacteriological weapons, attempting to obstruct and sabotage the armistice negotiations. But whether on the battlefield or at the conference table, the enemy has suffered severe blows. The U.S. aggressors delayed the Korean armistice negotiations for more than fourteen months, attempting to maintain international tension, continue to expand their military, arm Japan, and prepare to expand their war of aggression. But the continuation of the war means that U.S. imperialism will suffer greater and incalculable losses. From October 25, 1950, when the Chinese People's Volunteers joined the war, to the end of August this year, the enemy had been annihilated over 600,000 troops on the Korean battlefield, of which more than 270,000 were U.S. aggressor troops. The U.S. aggressors have invested more than 1.5 million troops on the Korean battlefield, consuming an average of 975,000 tons of materials per month in Korea. The war expenses, according to the generals on Wall Street, have already cost 15 billion U.S. dollars (actually exceeding 20 billion U.S. dollars). The victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea has given the people of the world a good education. The Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, have defeated the number one imperialist—the United States and the combined forces of its seventeen vassal states. This fact has helped the people of the world recognize the strength of the peace camp and the weakness of the imperialist camp, thereby inspiring the world's people's confidence and determination to defend peace. On the other hand, our great victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea disrupted the entire aggressive plan of U.S. imperialism. The small Korean battlefield has absorbed a considerable amount of U.S. troops, and has been and continues to cause it a large amount of manpower and material consumption, making it impossible for the U.S. aggressors to transfer more troops and war materials to Europe and other places, thus completely disrupting its entire war deployment and causing increasingly sharp contradictions within the entire imperialism. If the war is prolonged, the U.S. imperialists will suffer greater opposition from the American people, become more isolated in front of the people of the world, and the contradictions between capitalist countries will be further expanded. On the contrary, the peace forces of the people all over the world will become increasingly strong. The Chinese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has won a great and brilliant victory.
    In the past three years, our land reform has achieved greater success. From
    1950 to August 1952, land reform was completed in areas with a population of 278 million agricultural people. Together with those completed before 1950, land reform has now been completed for 428 million agricultural people across the country. With the exception of a small number of ethnic minority areas where land reform will not be implemented for the time being, the entire land reform movement will be fully completed this winter and next spring. In terms of financial and economic aspects: the motherland's production has recovered and exceeded the highest level in Chinese history. The national average of 35 major industrial products has reached 126% of the highest annual output before the War of Resistance. The total agricultural output in 1951 has recovered to 92.8% of the highest annual output before the war. This year's total grain output may exceed the output of the highest year in our history. Our country has a surplus of grain, and cotton can already be self-sufficient. The people's government's investment in water conservancy this year is 52 times greater than the highest investment year of the Kuomintang reactionary government. We have over-fulfilled the Jingjiang flood diversion and continued the Huai River renovation project, and completed the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway ahead of schedule. In the past year, after the
    “Three-Anti” and “Five-Anti” campaigns, the “three evils” and “five poisons” left over from the old society were cleansed, and a universal and in-depth social reform was carried out, preparing the necessary conditions for the upcoming great construction. As we celebrate the great National Day, we review the glorious achievements of the motherland in the past three years. Countless facts have clearly proved that the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Chairman Mao, is the most trustworthy leader of the Chinese people. Always follow the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese people will always be victorious.
    While we celebrate the third National Day of our great motherland, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, representing 1.6 billion peace-loving people from more than 30 countries, will be held in Beijing, further highlighting the significance of our great festival. The consolidation of the people's political power in the motherland and the brilliant achievements of the construction cause play a significant role in safeguarding peace in Asia and even the world.
    New China has become strong, and the era when the Chinese people were humiliated is gone forever. However, imperialists and their lackeys are still using every method to persecute overseas Chinese. Therefore, we pay close attention to overseas Chinese. As we celebrate the third National Day of the motherland, we believe that overseas Chinese will further strengthen their unity, promote the spirit of patriotism, strengthen friendly relations with the people of their residence, and strive to protect their legitimate rights and interests.
    We hope that overseas Chinese will join hands with the people of the motherland to make more and greater contributions to building a new China, completing the people's revolutionary cause, opposing imperialist aggression, and striving for the cause of lasting world peace.

    为祖国人民三年来的成就而欢呼
    中国致公党中央委员会主席
    陈其尤
    中华人民共和国成立三周年的伟大节日到来了，在这伟大的节日里，让我们为祖国人民三年来光辉的成就而欢呼！
    由于中朝部队继续在朝鲜作战并不断的胜利，使美帝国主义不能不被迫接受停战谈判；又由于他们不甘失败，竟继续用卑鄙无耻的手段从事屠杀战俘，使用细菌武器，妄图阻挠和破坏停战谈判。但是无论在战场上或会场上，敌人都受到了严重的打击。美国侵略者拖延朝鲜停战谈判足足超过了十四个月，企图保持国际紧张局势，继续扩充军备，武装日本，准备扩大侵略战争。但是战争继续下去，即意味着美帝国主义将遭受更大的不可估计的损失。自从我国人民志愿军在一九五○年十月二十五日参加作战到今年八月底为止，敌人在朝鲜战场上共被歼灭六十万人以上，其中美国侵略军占二十七万以上。美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上投入兵力已达一百五十万以上，平均每月在朝鲜消耗物资九十七万五千吨，战费的消耗据华尔街的将军们自己承认亦已用去一百五十亿美元（实际已超过二百亿美元）。抗美援朝的胜利，给了世界人民一个很好的教育。中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，已经打败了头号帝国主义——美国及其十七个仆从国家的联合力量，这一事实帮助全世界人民认识了和平阵营力量的强大和帝国主义阵营力量的虚弱，从而鼓舞了世界人民保卫和平的信心和决心。另一方面，我们抗美援朝的伟大胜利，打乱了美帝国主义整个侵略计划。小小的朝鲜战场就吸住了美国军队相当大的力量，而且已经和正在继续使它遭受到大量的人力和物力的消耗，使美国侵略者无法把更多的兵力和战争物资调到欧洲和其他地方去，因此把它整个战争布署完全打乱，并引起了整个帝国主义内部愈来愈尖锐的矛盾。战争再拖延下去，美帝国主义者还要遭受美国人民更大的反对，还要在世界人民面前变成更孤立，在资本主义各国间的矛盾还要更加的扩大。恰恰相反，全世界人民的和平力量则将日益壮大。中国人民的抗美援朝斗争，已经赢得了伟大辉煌的胜利。
    三年来，我们的土地改革获得了更大的成就。从
    一九五○年到一九五二年八月止，在二亿七千八百万农业人口地区完成了土地改革，连同一九五○年以前完成的，全国现已完成四亿二千八百万农业人口的土地改革。除一小部分少数民族地区暂不实行土地改革外，整个土地改革运动今冬明春即可全部完成。在财政经济方面：祖国生产已恢复并超过中国历史上最高的水平。全国三十五种主要工业产品平均已达到抗战前最高年产量的百分之一百二十六。农业总产量在一九五一年已恢复到战前最高年产量的百分之九十二点八、今年粮食总产量可超过我国历史上最高年份的产量。我国粮食已有盈余，棉花已可自给。人民政府今年对水利的投资大过国民党反动派政府最高投资年份的五十二倍。我们超计划地完成了荆江分洪和继续了淮河的兴修工程，提前完成成渝铁路和天兰铁路。最近一年，经过了
    “三反”和“五反”的斗争，清洗了旧社会遗留下来的
    “三害”和“五毒”，进行了普遍而深入的社会改革，为即将到来的伟大建设，准备了必要的胜利条件。在庆祝伟大的国庆节时，我们检阅祖国三年来辉煌的成就，无数的事实确切地证明了以毛主席为首的中国共产党，是中国人民最可信赖的领导者。永远跟着中国共产党走，中国人民就能永远胜利。
    我们庆祝伟大祖国第三届国庆节的同时，代表三十余个国家十六亿和平人民的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将在北京召开，益发显现我们这伟大节日的意义。祖国人民政权的巩固与建设事业光辉的成就，在保卫亚洲以至世界的和平上，起着重大的作用。
    新中国已经强大起来了，中国人民被侮辱的时代已一去不复返了。但是帝国主义及其走狗们还用尽方法迫害华侨。因此我们对于海外华侨备致关切。当我们庆祝祖国第三届国庆节的时候，我们相信海外华侨更将加强团结，发扬爱国主义精神，密切与侨居地人民的友谊关系，为保护自身正当权益而奋斗。
    我们希望海外华侨将和祖国人民一起，为建设新中国、完成人民革命事业，为反对帝国主义侵略、争取世界持久和平事业，作出更多更大的贡献。
