The letters hailing the great achievements of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference continue to pour into the editorial department of this newspaper from all sides. All the comrades of the Second Platoon of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who are standing on the front line of defending peace, wrote in their letter: We firmly believe that the "Resolution on the Korean Question" of the Peace Conference is the fairest and most reasonable way to solve the Korean question, but we have not ignored the fact that the US side recently unilaterally and unreasonably suspended the negotiations. We would like to assure the representatives attending the Peace Conference: we can not only force the aggressors to sit down for negotiations, but also force them to accept the wishes of the peace-loving people; if the enemy dares to sabotage the negotiations and expand the war of aggression, we are fully confident of defeating it. The letter from all the comrades of the Fifth Squad of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army expressed the same will. They said: The victorious conclusion of the Peace Conference shows that the force of peace is growing stronger. We are determined to carry the cause of defending peace to the end in accordance with the instructions of the peace-loving people. Wang Yongdao, a People's Navy soldier guarding the motherland's coastline, wrote: "In addition to working hard to publicize the great achievements of the Peace Conference, I guarantee to complete my study tasks 100%, better master modern technology, and defend peace."

Workers and production managers in factories expressed their intention to celebrate the achievements of the Peace Conference by stepping up production. Wang Xiumin and Ju Mingwu from the Liaoxi Province Ceramics Factory wrote: We guarantee to widely and deeply publicize the resolutions and spirit of the Peace Conference among all employees, and encourage everyone to realize the various resolutions of the Peace Conference with practical actions. Gu Zhong, a worker at the Shenyang Machinery Plant No. 12, wrote: The victorious conclusion of the Peace Conference has brought us higher production enthusiasm. The foundry molding team created an unprecedented record of producing twenty large castings per day, and comrades Wang Bingchen and others in the planer team also exceeded the original daily production plan. Everyone expressed their attitude and guaranteed to complete the increased production plan for the fourth quarter ahead of schedule, adding strength to the peace camp.

Cui Zuoyu from the Yunnan Provincial Lihua Ning No. 2 Junior High School wrote: In the past, some people said: "Officials occupy the fields, the people occupy the slopes, and the Miao and Yi should live in the mountain nests." In fact, "living in mountain nests" cannot be peaceful either, and they still have to suffer the abuse and humiliation of the reactionaries. Now we live happily in the big family of the new China and go to school. Therefore, our unanimous slogan is: do not allow anyone to destroy our peaceful and happy life, and the various resolutions passed by the Peace Conference reflect our heartfelt wishes.

Letters from the Nanjing Cadre School, the Central University for Nationalities, the primary school in Anyang City, and Liu Changling, a 64-year-old housewife in Beijing, and others, all expressed the Chinese people's sincere desire for peace and their firm will to defend peace.

    保卫和平的钢铁意志
    ——读者来信综述
    欢呼亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议伟大成就的信件，继续从各方面寄到本报编辑部。站在保卫和平最前线的中国人民志愿军某部二排全体同志来信说：我们深信和平会议“关于朝鲜问题的决议”，是解决朝鲜问题最公平合理的办法，但我们也没有忽视最近美方蛮横无理地片面中止谈判的事实。我们谨向出席和平会议的代表们提出保证：我们既能迫使侵略者坐下来谈判，也能迫使他们接受和平人民的愿望；如果敌人敢于破坏谈判，扩大侵略战争，我们也完全有信心打败它。志愿军某部五班全体同志的来信中，表示了同样的意志。他们说：和平会议的胜利闭幕，表示了和平的力量更加壮大。我们决心依照和平人民的嘱托，把保卫和平事业担当到底。守卫在祖国海防线上的人民海军战士汪永道来信说：“我除了努力宣传和平会议的伟大成就外，保证百分之百地完成学习任务，更好地掌握现代技术，捍卫和平。”
    工厂里的工人和生产管理者，表示要以加紧生产来祝贺和平会议的成就。辽西省陶瓷厂王秀岷、鞠明武来信说：我们保证把和平会议的决议和精神，在全体职工中进行广泛深入的宣传，鼓励大家用实际行动来实现和平会议的各项决议。沈阳机械十二厂工人顾众来信说：和平会议的胜利闭幕给我们带来了更高的生产热情。铸工翻砂组创出了大铸件日产二十片的空前纪录，刨工班王秉臣等同志也超过了原订日产计划。人人都表示了态度，保证提前完成第四季度的增产计划，为和平阵营增加力量。
    云南省立华宁第二初级中学崔作雨来信说：过去有人说：“官占田，民占坡，苗、彝应该住山窝。”其实“住山窝”也不能安宁，还得受反动派的糟蹋和侮辱。现在我们幸福地生活在新中国的大家庭中，到学校里念书了。因此我们一致的口号是：不让任何人来破坏我们和平幸福的生活，而和平会议通过的各项决议正反映了我们的衷心愿望。
    来自南京市干部学校，来自中央民族学院，来自安阳市的小学校的信件，以及北京市六十四岁的家庭妇女刘长龄等寄来的信件，都表达了中国人民热爱和平的衷心愿望，和保卫和平的坚强意志。
