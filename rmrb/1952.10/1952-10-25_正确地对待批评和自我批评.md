Editor's Note: Recently, readers from various locations have written to reflect that their criticisms and suggestions published in this newspaper have attracted the attention of leading organs and cadres, leading to improvements in work. These letters also show that units that correctly accept newspaper criticisms and improve their work have enhanced their prestige among the masses and received their support.

Now, we are publishing letters from readers thanking the leadership organs of GuiSui and Baotou cities in Suiyuan Province for accepting mass opinions and resolving the issue of meat supply for Muslims, as well as letters from readers supporting the Yishui Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong for accepting newspaper criticisms and improving leadership over the Party newspaper. We also hope that the broad masses of readers will continue to help us check the actual effect of publishing readers' letters of criticism in the newspaper, and write to us so that criticism and self-criticism in the newspaper can be carried out more correctly and effectively.

The People's Governments of GuiSui and Baotou Cities Have Seriously Resolved the Meat Supply Issue for Muslims

(I)

Comrade Editor: The "Reader's Letters Column" on July 23rd published a "Reader's Letters Summary" entitled "Suggestions to Relevant Departments on Solving the Problem of Meat Shortages for Muslims." After reading it, we deeply felt that this was exactly what Muslims in GuiSui City wanted to say. After the publication of this correct suggestion, it attracted the attention of the Suiyuan Province and GuiSui City People's Governments. After the People's Government convened a special meeting and the relevant organs conducted specific research, the problem of meat supply for Muslims in GuiSui City has been resolved.

The organ in GuiSui City that inspects the slaughter of livestock, based on the newspaper's opinion, relaxed the standards for prohibition of slaughter, reducing the age limit for slaughtering cattle from fourteen years to ten years, and relaxing the rule that female livestock cannot be slaughtered to allow slaughter of those that meet the requirements except for pregnant female livestock. The Provincial Cooperative General Agency and the Native Produce Company also took good care of us. When the Native Produce Company purchases cattle and sheep, if there are not many cattle and sheep on the livestock market, they give priority to us Muslims; sometimes they even give part of the cattle and sheep they bought to Muslims. In addition, 96 Muslim butcher households in the city received 100 million yuan in loans from the People's Bank, and organized seven groups in the form of joint purchase and distribution. Under the leadership and assistance of the Provincial Ethnic Affairs Commission and the Municipal People's Government, they participated in the Bailingmiao Material Exchange Conference and signed a contract with the Siziwang Banner to buy a large number of cattle and sheep. They also went to Tuoketuo County, Wudong County and other places to purchase cattle and sheep. In this way, the problem of the source of beef and mutton was basically solved.

Now, cattle and sheep in the GuiSui City livestock market are continuously available. Butchers are busy, slaughtering more than ten cattle and one hundred thirty to forty sheep every day. Fresh beef and mutton can be bought in every street and alley, and Muslims no longer feel the lack of meat.

During this year's "Eid al-Adha" (i.e., "Sacrifice Feast"), Muslims in GuiSui City prepared cattle and sheep to celebrate this festival. We Muslims sincerely thank the Suiyuan Province and GuiSui City People's Governments for helping us solve the meat supply problem, and thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for their concern and love for us minority peoples.

Comrade Editor: I am a Muslim in Baotou City. Before July, we had a situation where we could not buy beef and mutton here. Since the "Reader's Letters Column" of the People's Daily on July 23rd suggested that the people's governments of various places find ways to solve this problem, the Baotou City People's Government attached great importance to it and quickly lowered the cattle inspection standards (previously, slaughter was only allowed for cattle over thirteen years old, but now it is over ten years old). The Baotou City Branch of the People's Bank of China also issued 35 million yuan in loans to the beef and mutton industry.

In this way, the market supply of cattle and sheep gradually increased in August. At the end of August, the average daily slaughter of cattle was more than ten heads and more than twenty sheep for each beef and mutton slaughterhouse in the city; and this number is increasing day by day. Now, the Baotou City Branch of the People's Bank of China is preparing to lend money to the local cattle and sheep slaughterers to organize them to buy cattle and sheep from other places. So far, the problem of meat consumption for Muslims in Baotou City has been resolved.

This incident made me once again deeply feel the meticulous care of the Communist Party and the People's Government for us minority nationalities. I thank the Party and the People's Government.

The Yishui Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong Has Strengthened Its Leadership Over the Local Party Newspaper

Comrade Editor: After the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on April 1st published our letter criticizing the Yishui Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong for neglecting the leadership of the Party newspaper ("Yishui Rural Newspaper"), the Yishui Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party seriously reviewed its work (published in the "Reader's Letters" column on April 25th) and took a series of improvement measures in practical work.

The Prefectural Committee's leadership over the newspaper has been strengthened. The Minister of Propaganda of the Prefectural Committee personally helps the newspaper to study the overall work, and often gives specific instructions. The Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office can send the instructions, plans and other documents of the current work to the newspaper in a timely manner, so that the newspaper can understand the overall work situation of the special zone. The Propaganda Department of the Prefectural Committee decided that from April, a meeting of communication officers of each county will be held every two months to specifically study the issue of carrying out newspaper mass work.

The Prefectural Committee also attaches great importance to using the Party newspaper to promote work. In addition to helping the newspaper expand its circulation, it has also issued instructions to the Party committees of various counties and districts under its jurisdiction many times. Therefore, the Party committees of various counties and districts also attach importance to the work of the Party newspaper. The guiding role played by the newspaper in the masses has been greatly strengthened than before.

We fully support the correct attitude of the Yishui Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in attaching importance to newspaper criticism and earnestly improving its work. This correct attitude not only encourages our work enthusiasm, but also educates us on how to correctly treat criticism and self-criticism.

### 正确地对待批评和自我批评

    正确地对待批评和自我批评
    编者按：近来各地读者陆续来信反映：他们的批评、建议信件在本报发表后，已经引起领导机关和干部的重视，使工作得到了改进。从这些来信中又可看出：凡是正确接受报纸批评、改进工作的单位，都提高了在群众中的威信，受到了群众的拥护。
    现在，我们把读者感谢绥远省归绥、包头两市领导机关接受群众意见解决回民食肉问题的来信，和读者拥护中共山东沂水地委会接受报纸批评改进对党报的领导工作的来信发表于后。我们还希望广大读者继续帮助我们检查报纸发表读者批评信件后的实际效果，并写信告诉我们，使报纸上的批评和自我批评能够更加正确而有效地展开。
    归绥、包头两市人民政府已认真解决回民食肉问题
    （一）
    编辑同志：七月二十三日“读者来信专页”刊登了“建议有关部门解决回民缺少肉食的问题”的
    “读者来信综述”。我们读了，深深感到这正是我们归绥市回民心里要说的话。这个正确的建议发表后，引起了绥远省和归绥市人民政府的重视。经过人民政府召开专门会议，以及各有关机关具体研究后，归绥市回民肉食问题已经得到了解决。
    归绥市检查屠宰牲畜的机关根据报纸的意见，放宽了禁宰的标准，把可宰牛只的年龄限制从十四岁降低为十岁，把不能宰牝畜的规定放宽为除怀胎牝畜外，合乎规定者就可屠宰。省合作总社和土产公司对我们也很照顾，土产公司采购牛羊时，如牲畜市上牛羊不多，就尽先让我们回民买；有时还把他们买得的牛羊让出一部分给回民。此外，全市九十六户回民屠商得到了人民银行一亿元贷款的帮助，以联购分销的办法组织了七个小组，在省民族事务委员会和市人民政府的领导和帮助下，参加了百灵庙物资交流大会，和四子王旗订立了合同，买了大批牛羊。他们还分别到托克托县、武东县等地采购牛羊。这样，就基本解决了牛羊肉来源的问题。
    现在归绥市牲畜市上牛羊源源不绝。屠商们忙个不停，每天能宰十多条牛、一百三、四十只羊。大街小巷都可买到新鲜牛羊肉，回民的肉食再也不感缺乏了。
    在今年的“古尔邦”节（即“宰牲节”），归绥市回民都准备了牛羊，欢度了这一节日。我们回民都从心里感谢绥远省和归绥市人民政府帮助我们解决了肉食问题，感谢毛主席、共产党对我们少数民族人民的关心和爱护。

    （二）
    编辑同志：我是包头市的一个回民。在七月份以前，我们这里出现了买不到牛羊肉的情况。自从七月二十三日人民日报“读者来信专页”建议各地人民政府想法解决这个问题后，包头市人民政府十分重视，很快地降低了验牛标准（从前是十三岁以上才准宰，现在是十岁以上），中国人民银行包头市支行也向牛羊肉业发放了三千五百万元的贷款。
    这样，八月间牛羊的上市量就逐渐增加了。八月底，我们全市的牛羊屠宰户平均每天可宰牛十多头，羊二十多只；而且这个数字还在一天天地增加。现在，中国人民银行包头市支行又准备贷款给本市的牛羊屠户，组织他们到外地去购买牛羊。至此，我们包头市回民的食肉问题已经解决了。
    这件事使我又一次深深地感到共产党和人民政府对我们少数民族无微不至的关怀。我感谢党和人民政府。

    中共山东沂水地委会已加强对地方党报的领导
    编辑同志：四月一日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了我们对中共山东沂水地委会忽视领导党报（“沂水农村”报）工作的批评信后，中共沂水地委会就认真作了检讨（已刊四月二十五日“读者来信”栏），并在实际工作中采取了一系列的改进措施。
    地委会对报社的领导加强了。地委宣传部长亲自帮助报社研究全盘工作，并经常给予具体指示。地委会和专署对当前各项工作的指示、计划等文件，都能及时发给报社，使报社能够了解专区的全面工作情况。地委宣传部决定，从四月份起，每两月召开一次各县通讯干事会议，专门研究开展报纸群众工作问题。
    地委会还十分重视运用党报推动工作。除了帮助报纸扩大发行数量外，并多次向所属各县、区党委发出指示。因此，各县、区党委对党报工作也重视了。报纸在群众中所起的指导作用比以前大大加强了。
    我们十分拥护中共沂水地委会重视报纸批评、认真改进工作的正确态度。这种正确的态度不仅鼓励了我们工作的积极性，而且教育了我们应该怎样正确地对待批评和自我批评。
