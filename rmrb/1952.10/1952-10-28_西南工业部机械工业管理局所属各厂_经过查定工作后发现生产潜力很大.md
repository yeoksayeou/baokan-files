The factories under the Mechanical Industry Administration of the Southwest Industrial Department, Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, have achieved great results since the widespread launch of production capacity survey work in late September. Most factories are now completing this work.

The factories under Southwest Mechanical Industry produce a wide variety of products and the production targets are very unstable. In terms of business management, there is a great deal of blindness and confusion. Therefore, from the leading organs down to the management cadres of each factory, no one knows how much production capacity each factory actually has. This hinders the improvement of production management. After the Mechanical Industry Administration of the Southwest Industrial Department decided to conduct survey work in its affiliated factories, it formed four working groups to assist the work in each factory. At the beginning of the survey work, some cadres had concerns. Some were afraid that if the production capacity was assessed too high, they would be criticized for failing to complete the task in the future; others were afraid that the machines in their factory would be transferred after the assessment. The bureau educated the cadres in each factory in a timely manner, explaining that only by fully understanding the production capacity can the potential of existing production equipment be utilized in a planned way and production efficiency be improved. It also used examples of how production capacity has increased compared to the past to educate and overcome the departmentalism and conservatism of cadres, laying the ideological foundation for the survey work.

The survey work has proven that the potential of existing production equipment in each factory is very large. This potential has not been fully realized due to the imbalance of production, the inappropriate allocation of labor, and the use of machinery. Factory 204 under the bureau originally believed that this year's production target was too high and could not be completed. However, according to the results of this survey, as long as the existing production equipment is adjusted and labor is appropriately allocated, the production capacity can be increased by more than two times. Generally, as long as the potential of existing production equipment is further developed, productivity can be increased by at least one time.

This survey work is of extremely important significance for the future development of production and improvement of business management in the Southwest mechanical factories. Through this survey, not only have the leading cadres at all levels understood the potential capacity of the existing production equipment of the factories, but also each factory has been able to understand the weakest links in production and clarify the direction of efforts; in particular, it has provided extremely favorable conditions for the planning work of the mechanical industry's capital construction next year.

    西南工业部机械工业管理局所属各厂
    经过查定工作后发现生产潜力很大
    西南军政委员会工业部机械工业管理局所属各厂，自九月下旬普遍开展生产能力查定工作以来，收到很大成效，现大部分工厂已将结束这一工作。
    西南机械各厂生产的产品种类很多，生产对象很不固定，在经营管理上，又带有很大的盲目性和混乱现象，因此，自领导机关一直到各工厂管理干部，对各厂内究竟有多大的生产能力都心中无数。这就阻碍了生产管理的改进。西南工业部机械工业管理局决定在所属各厂进行查定工作以后，组成了四个工作组，分别到各厂协助工作。在进行查定工作之初，某些干部还有顾虑，有的怕生产能力查定高了，将来完不成任务要受批评；有的怕查定后把本厂的机器调走。该局适时地向各厂干部进行了教育，说明只有充分了解生产能力后，才能有计划地发挥现有生产设备的潜在力，提高生产效率。并以生产能力现在比过去提高了的实例进行教育，克服干部中的本位主义和保守思想，为查定工作奠定了思想基础。
    从查定工作中，证明各厂现有生产设备的潜在能力很大。这种潜在能力由于生产的不平衡，劳动力的配备和机器的使用不恰当，没有得到充分发挥。该局所属二零四厂原认为今年的生产任务订得过高，不能完成任务。可是，根据这次查定结果，该厂只要就现有生产设备加以调整，再适当地配备劳动力，生产能力可以提高两倍以上。一般厂只要进一步发挥现有生产设备的潜在能力，生产力最少可以提高一倍。
    这次查定工作，对西南各机械厂今后发展生产，改善经营管理，有异常重要的意义。通过这次查定，不仅使各级领导干部了解了工厂现有生产设备的潜在能力，而且各厂能够了解生产上最薄弱的环节，明确努力方向；特别是给机械工业明年基本建设的计划工作，提供了极有利的条件。
