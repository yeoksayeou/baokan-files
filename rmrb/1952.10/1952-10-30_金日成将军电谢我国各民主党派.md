Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 29th: General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, replied on the 27th to the congratulatory telegram from China's democratic parties on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into Korea to fight. The telegram is as follows: The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Communist Party of China, The Kuomitan Revolutionary Committee, the China Democratic League, the China Democratic National Construction Association, Non-Party Democratic Personages of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the China Association For Promoting Democray, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiu San Society, the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.

    I extend my deepest gratitude to you for the militant congratulations you have given to the Korean People's Army, the Korean people, and myself on behalf of the entire fraternal Chinese people on the occasion of the second anniversary of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea to fight.

    The sons and daughters of the great Chinese people—the Chinese People's Volunteers—have fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army in the past two years of war, giving the US imperialist armed invaders an irreparable blow and laying the foundation for final victory.

    The heroic military exploits of the Chinese People's Volunteers have made great contributions to defending the independence of Korea and the security of China, as well as the peace of Asia and the world. As a vivid example of mutual assistance among peace-loving people of the world, they have greatly encouraged the peace-loving people of the world.

    I am convinced that the just and common struggle of the people of Korea and China, supported by the peace-loving people of the world headed by the Soviet Union, will completely shatter the shameful conspiracy of US imperialism to expand the war and achieve a glorious final victory.

    Long live the strengthening of the militant friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China and the great final victory!

Kim Il-sung
October 27, 1952, Pyongyang
