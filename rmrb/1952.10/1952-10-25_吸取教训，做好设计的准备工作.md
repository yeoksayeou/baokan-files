Learn from the Past, Prepare for Design Work
Zhu Guoping, Manager of the Civil Engineering and Architectural Design Company, Northeast Industrial Department

The design work of the Civil Engineering and Architectural Design Company of the Northeast Industrial Department for 1952 has concluded. The design work for 1953 has already begun. The design tasks for 1953 are even heavier than those of 1952. In addition to the design of standard dormitories, the area of various buildings requested by each unit for our design is more than twice that of 1952. This is a glorious and arduous task. To better complete this task, we must accept past experiences and lessons, and earnestly solve the following problems:

First, we must seize the time to conduct surveying and investigation work, and proactively and actively collect design data. According to past experiences and lessons, a major reason for the slowness of design work is waiting for data. Last year, we did not seize the time to conduct geological surveys and topographic measurements, so many projects were designed and surveyed on a temporary basis; some projects were even designed and surveyed simultaneously. For example, the construction of the Anshan Workers' Village should have been surveyed and measured last winter, but it was not done at that time. It was not until the construction season in March and April this year that we conducted the survey and measurement, which delayed the design time and affected construction. Another example is the design of the technical school. Due to the incorrect method of simultaneous design and survey, the technical design was completed in mid-April this year, but the geological data was not fully clarified. The foundation construction drawings were not made until early May. Also, because the geological data on which the original plan was based was incorrect, some completed designs often had to be reworked.

The main reason for these phenomena is the lack of attention to surveying and measurement work. Some units mistakenly regard the survey work as a procedure to cope with the superiors. They did not survey the geological conditions before preparing for construction. When they heard that the Northeast Industrial Department was going to review the geological data, they rushed to the design company to ask them to provide geological data to cope with the Industrial Department's review. There are also shortcomings in the design department. For example, the projects we undertook in 1952 all required surveying and measurement work, but the construction unit did not entrust us with it, so we did not proactively seize the time to carry it out. Some individual designers also believe that geological and topographical data are dispensable. For example, when designing a workshop for a large foundry, the factory said: "No measurement has been done, just design it as a flat ground!" Our designers casually agreed to design it as a flat ground. After construction, problems occurred, causing great losses. When some designers designed a sand turning factory for the Northeast Electric Engineering Bureau, they did not actively help the client to study and confirm the design data, so difficulties occurred in the design, and the entire design was reworked eighteen times, resulting in waste.

Surveying and measurement work takes a relatively long time, but we have not recognized this point. Therefore, we did not carry out drilling until the technical design stage. Some people think that geological survey work is only a matter of soil bearing capacity; they think that solving the problem of soil bearing capacity is equivalent to solving the problem of geological data. This view is incorrect. Because in the geological survey work, in addition to knowing the soil bearing capacity, it is also necessary to know the changes in the strata, the situation of groundwater, etc. To know these underground conditions, it must take a long time. Even understanding the soil bearing capacity cannot be done in a very short time. We must first make a topographic map, then drill carefully, take out the soil, and then analyze and analyze it. Only in this way can we calculate the correct soil bearing capacity figure. In the past, our understanding was insufficient, and we did not give enough time to surveying and measurement work, so that surveying and measurement work could not keep up with the needs.

We also have passive waiting ideas in collecting design data. We started accepting this year's design tasks in September last year, but because the data was incomplete, the official design of most projects did not start until April this year. The most important design plan task book was not finalized until April and May this year. One reason is that the construction unit did not prepare the design data in time, and the other reason is that the design company had a passive waiting idea, believing that the incompleteness of the data was entirely the responsibility of the construction unit and had nothing to do with me. At present, the construction units are busy with this year's work. If the design unit does not actively assist the construction unit in collecting data, it will inevitably affect the completion of the task. It is an important guarantee for completing next year's design that the design unit promptly submits the list of data required for the design to the construction unit for preparation, and proactively assists the construction unit in collecting data.

Second, we must strengthen standardized design. At present, the design force for capital construction is weak, which cannot keep up with the requirements of construction. The way to solve this problem is to strengthen standardized design. For example, when designing staff dormitories, if each house has to have a different design, it will not only waste manpower and time, but also is unnecessary. Therefore, we have conducted standard design of staff dormitories, and a set of dormitory designs can solve the problem of dormitory construction for many units. In 1952, we also adopted partial standard design when designing technical schools, which greatly saved manpower and time. In 1953, we are also preparing for standard design of buildings such as school main buildings, faculty dormitories, student dormitories, office buildings, canteens, warehouses, clubs, hospitals, nurseries, and cooperatives.

In addition, strengthening the design of standard construction drawings is also a very important issue. According to Soviet experience, construction drawings of various building components are drawn and printed into books for designers to use. This can not only improve design efficiency, but also avoid possible errors in drawing construction drawings.

In the past, in the standard design of staff dormitories, some of our technicians had incorrect views. They believe that: doing standard design does not show their skills and cannot improve their technology. Therefore, they took a careless and irresponsible attitude towards such an extremely important design work, so that many errors occurred in the standard design, which affected construction and caused dissatisfaction from all parties. This must be improved. We now recognize this shortcoming and are determined to put the standard design of staff dormitories in the first place in 1953, and strive to submit all construction drawings before the end of December this year with the greatest effort to ensure that each unit can prepare building materials and budgets in time, formulate accurate construction plans, and start construction on time.

Third, we must strive to improve the quality of design and overcome the extremely irresponsible work style in the design work in the past. In the design work in 1952, many errors occurred due to sloppiness. According to our statistics, there were hundreds of various large and small errors this year. Because of design errors, rework occurred continuously, delaying the design time and affecting the progress of construction. Therefore, in the design in 1953, we must be conscientious and responsible, strengthen the review system in all aspects, and resolutely overcome the phenomenon of rework after the design is completed.

Fourth, we must earnestly study Soviet experience. In 1952, although we studied Soviet experience, we did not study it thoroughly enough. For example, when adopting new design standards, many errors occurred due to not studying well. When studying engineering geological problems, we did not systematically study them as a whole set. Soviet experience has long told us that the soil in the upper part of the stratum will change its soil bearing capacity due to the different water content in spring and summer. Soviet experience has also long told us that the situation of groundwater level will also change due to seasonal changes and changes in the water level of nearby rivers. But we did not know these, we took the situation in spring as the material basis for design, and did not estimate the changes in summer, as a result, the basements of several buildings were flooded in autumn.

Based on these experiences and lessons, we have made arrangements for the work in 1953. We have universally conducted measurement and drilling work. The measurement work will be basically completed in October this year, and the drilling work will be completed before the end of the year. In this way, we have prepared the necessary conditions for the completion of the design tasks in 1953.

Now we have completed the data collection work for seven key factory buildings, and have started the preliminary design. At present, we are conducting the standard design of staff dormitories. As for other standard designs, we have already submitted preliminary quota drafts to the Northeast Industrial Department for review. The remaining standard designs are all striving to complete the technical design and submit some construction drawings before the end of this year.

To ensure that the task can be completed smoothly, we have also strengthened the strength of plumbing and heating design, electrical lighting design, soil analysis and engineering budget. Because these aspects are the weakest link in our work. To strengthen the strength in this area, we have opened an electrical lighting design training class. It is expected that the students of this training class can participate in the work in November. In terms of plumbing and heating design and engineering budget, we are preparing to open training classes. In terms of soil analysis, we have added twice the equipment on the original basis, and trained three times more reserve forces than the existing personnel. In this way, we can gradually solve the problem of insufficient manpower in some of our departments. According to last year's experience, the specialization of design work is also a good way to improve design quality and cultivate specialized cadres. Therefore, we have divided the design personnel into work groups specializing in factory construction, civil construction, education and administration, health care, general plan, standard construction drawings, water and heating, electrical lighting and engineering budget to cultivate specialized design talents. We have also initially drafted the work quota for design work, so that everyone has a certain goal to strive for in their daily work. Because we have summarized the past experience and done some necessary preparations, we are more confident to guarantee the completion of the design tasks in 1953.

    吸取教训，做好设计的准备工作
    东北工业部土木建筑设计公司经理　朱国平
    东北工业部土木建筑设计公司的一九五二年的设计工作，已经结束。一九五三年的设计工作业已开始。一九五三年的设计任务，比一九五二年更加繁重。一九五三年除了标准宿舍的设计以外，各单位要求我们设计的各种建筑物的面积，比一九五二年大两倍多。这是一个光荣而艰巨的任务。为了更好地完成这个任务，必须接受以往的经验和教训，认真地解决下面几个问题：
    第一，必须抓紧时间进行勘察和调查工作，主动地、积极地搜集设计资料。根据过去的经验教训，设计工作之所以迟缓，等待资料是一个重要的原因。去年，我们没有抓紧时间进行地质勘察和地形测量工作，以致许多工程都是临时设计，临时勘察；有的工程甚至是一面设计一面勘察。例如鞍山工人村的建筑，在去年冬季就应该进行勘察和测量，但是当时没有做，直到今年三、四月施工季节，我们才进行勘察和测量，因而拖延了设计的时间，影响施工。又如设计技术学校时，由于不正确地采取了一面设计一面勘察和测量的方法，因此，今年
    四月中旬作好了技术设计，但地质资料还未完全弄清楚，直到五月上旬才做出基础的施工图。又因为原计划所依据的地质资料不正确，有些已完成的设计，常有返工现象。
    产生这些现象的原因，主要是没有重视勘察和测量工作。有些单位错误地把勘察工作看成是应付上级的手续。他们没有勘察地质情况，就准备施工，及至听说东北工业部要审查地质资料，才急忙地到设计公司要求给他们提出地质资料，以应付工业部的审查。在设计部门方面，也有缺点。例如一九五二年我们所承担的工程，都是需要进行勘察和测量工作的，但是建设单位没有委托我们，我们也就没有主动地抓紧时间去进行，还有个别设计人员，认为地质和地形资料是可有可无的。比如设计某大型铸造工厂厂房，厂方说：“测量没有做，就照平地设计吧！”我们的设计人员也就轻率地答应照平地设计。施工之后，发生问题，造成很大的损失。有些设计人员设计东北电工局的一个翻砂厂时，没有主动地帮助甲方研究和肯定设计资料，因此在设计中发生困难，全部设计返工十八次，产生浪费现象。
    勘察和测量工作，需要比较长的时间，但我们没有认清楚这一点。因此在进行技术设计的时候，才进行钻探。有些人认为地质勘察工作仅是地耐力的问题；以为解决了地耐力的问题，就解决了地质资料的问题。这种看法是不对的。因为在勘察地质工作中，除了要知道地耐力而外，还必须要知道地层的变化情况，地下水的情况等。要想知道这些地下情况，就必须要有较长的时间。即使是了解地耐力，也不是在很短时间内就能做到的事，必须先做出地形图，然后细致地钻探，取出土壤，并加以化验和分析。只有这样，才能算出正确的地耐力的数字。过去我们认识不足，没有给勘察和测量工作以足够的时间，因而使得勘察和测量工作赶不上需要。
    我们搜集设计资料，还有着消极等待的思想。在去年九月，我们就开始接受了今年的设计任务，但是因为资料不全，直拖到今年四月份，大部分工程的正式设计才开始进行。最重要的设计计划任务书，一直拖到今年四、五月份才确定下来。其原因一方面是建设单位没有及时准备设计资料，另一方面是设计公司有着消极等待的思想，认为资料不完全是建设单位的责任，和我无关。目前各建设单位正忙于今年的工作，设计单位如不主动地协助建设单位搜集资料。必然又要影响任务的完成。设计单位及时地把设计所需要的资料单交给建设单位进行准备，主动地协助建设单位搜集资料，是完成明年设计的重要保证。
    第二，必须加强标准化的设计。目前基本建设工作设计力量薄弱，赶不上施工的要求，解决这一问题的方法是加强标准化的设计。比如在设计职工宿舍时，如果每一栋房子都要有一套不同的设计，那不仅浪费人力和时间，而且也不必要。因此我们曾进行了职工宿舍的标准设计，做出一套宿舍的设计，就可以解决许多单位的宿舍的修建问题。一九五二年我们设计技术学校时，也采用了部分的标准设计，大大节省了人力和时间。一九五三年，我们还准备进行学校主楼、教员宿舍、学生宿舍、办公楼、食堂、仓库、俱乐部、医院、托儿所、合作社等建筑物的标准设计。
    此外，加强标准施工图的设计，也是很重要的问题。根据苏联的经验，绘制各种建筑构件的施工
    图，印制成册，以供设计者采用。这不仅可以提高设计效率，而且可以避免在绘制施工图当中可能发生的错误。
    过去在职工宿舍的标准设计中，我们有些技术人员有着不正确的看法。他们认为：做标准设计，显不出自己的本领，提高不了自己的技术。因此，他们对这样一个极其重要的设计工作，采取了马虎草率和不负责任的态度，以致在标准设计中，发生了很多错误，影响了施工，引起了各方面的不满。这是必须要改进的。我们现在已经认识了这个缺点，决心在一九五三年把职工宿舍的标准设计列为第一位，并以最大努力，争取在今年十二月底以前提出全部施工图，以保证各单位及时地准备建筑材料和预算，制订准确的施工计划，按时开工。
    第三，必须努力提高设计质量，克服以往在设计工作中的极不负责的作风。在一九五二年的设计工作中，因为草率从事，发生很多错误。根据我们的统计，今年各种大小错误竟达数百件。因为设计错误，就不断地发生返工的现象，拖延了设计时间，影响了施工的进度。因此在一九五三年的设计中，必须认真负责，加强各方面的审核制度，坚决克服在设计完成后又要返工的现象。
    第四，必须认真地学习苏联经验。一九五二年，我们虽然学习了苏联经验，但学得不够彻底。比如采用新的设计标准时，由于没有很好地学习，发生了很多差错。在学习工程地质问题时，也没有系统地整套地进行学习。苏联经验早告诉我们：地层的上部土壤，因春夏两季含水量不同，其地耐力是会发生变化的。苏联经验也早告诉我们：地下水位的情况也会因季节的变化和附近江河水位的变化而发生变化。但我们不知道这一些，我们把春季的情况作为材料根据进行设计，而没有估计到夏季的变化，结果几个建筑物的地下室在秋季都泡了水。
    根据这些经验和教训，我们对于一九五三年的工作，进行了布置。我们已经普遍地进行测量和钻探工作。在今年十月份基本完成测量工作，年底以前作完钻探工作。这样，我们就给一九五三年设计任务的完成，准备了必要的条件。
    现在我们已经完成七处重点厂房的搜集资料工作，并已开始了初步设计。目前我们正在进行职工宿舍的标准设计。至于其他的标准设计，我们业已提出初步定额草案，送东北工业部审核。其余的标准设计，均争取在今年年底以前完成技术设计，并提出部分施工图。
    为了保证任务能够顺利完成，我们还加强了水暖设计、电照设计、土壤分析和工程预算的力量。因为这些方面正是我们工作中最弱的一环。为了加强这方面的力量，我们开办了一个电照设计训练班，预计在十一月份这个训练班的学员就可以参加工作。在水暖设计和工程预算方面，我们正在筹备开办训练班。在土壤分析方面，我们已在原有的基础上增添了两倍的设备，并训练了比现有人员增加三倍的后备力量。这样，我们就可逐步地解决我们某些部门人力不足的问题。根据去年的经验，设计工作专业化也是提高设计质量、培养专门干部的好办法。因此我们已将设计人员划分为工厂建筑、民用建筑、教育行政、卫生保健、总平面、标准施工图、水道暖气、电气照明和工程预算等专业的工作组，以培养专门的设计人才。我们还初步拟出了设计工作的工作定额，使每一个人在每天的工作中，都有了一定的奋斗目标。由于我们总结了过去的经验，并做了一些必要的准备工作，我们就比较能有把握地保证完成一九五三年的设计任务。
