    To the National Opera Performance and Observation Meeting
    Mao Dun
    The first National Opera Performance and Observation Meeting is a concluding conference of opera reform work held on the basis of the literary and artistic rectification movement. It will summarize the experiences and lessons of the opera reform work over the past three years. It is hoped that it will play an important role in how to more correctly and resolutely adhere to Chairman Mao's direction in literature and art and achieve the task of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new."

    给全国戏曲观摩演出大会
    茅盾
    第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会是在文艺整风运动的基础上举行的戏曲改革工作的总结性的大会；这将总结三年来戏曲改革工作的经验和教训，对于今后如何更正确地坚决遵守毛主席的文艺方向，达成“百花齐放，推陈出新”的任务，希望一定能够起着重要的作用。
