    Shenyang to Build Large-Scale Housing for Workers

    With rapid production development and a continuous increase in the number of workers, Shenyang City has begun to build a large-scale new type of workers' residential area - "Workers' Village." "Workers' Village" occupies an area of more than 730,000 square meters, divided into four parts: family residential area, single dormitory area, social and administrative center area, and park area.

    According to the construction plan of the "Workers' Village", four nurseries, six kindergartens, two elementary schools, bathrooms, cooperatives, clinics, and more will be established in the center of the family residential area. In the south of the social and administrative center area, a large club that can accommodate 15,000 people will be established, with cinemas, libraries, and dance halls inside. Near the club there will be sports fields and swimming pools. Near the social and administrative center area, there will also be residential management offices, fire stations, canteens, and dormitories for single workers. A large park will be located in the triangular area between the family residential area and the social and administrative center area. A middle school that can accommodate more than 1,100 people will be established in this park.

    All the houses in the "Workers' Village" are three-story buildings, with a neat and beautiful appearance. Inside, there are wardrobes, electric lights, water and sewage systems, heating, gas, and other equipment. There are also small warehouses in the courtyard for storing miscellaneous items for each household.

    Eight State-Owned Factories in Shenyang Have Completed Their Annual Production Plans Ahead of Schedule

    Eight state-owned factories in Shenyang have completed their annual production plans and increased production and savings plans ahead of schedule. These eight factories are: Northeast Rubber Factory No. 4, Rubber Factory No. 5, Clothing Factory No. 3, Shenyang Cigarette Factory, Shenyang Paint Factory, Electromechanical Repair Factory, Sujiatun Processing Factory, and Asbestos Tile Factory. Among them, Rubber Factory No. 4 has proposed: By the end of the year, it will increase production and savings for the country equivalent to 12,732 tons of grain worth of wealth. Clothing Factory No. 3 also proposed to increase production and savings by 3,000 tons of grain by the end of the year. The main reason why the above-mentioned factories can complete their plans ahead of schedule is that advanced production experience has been promoted in a led, organized, and planned manner in the patriotic production increase and economy campaign. For example, in Clothing Factory No. 3, in the past four months, Jiang Wanshou's continuous operation method and seven technical essentials have been promoted among more than 90% of the workers. Workers throughout the factory found 376 "tips" in the third quarter alone, and summarized more than 20 advanced operating experiences to be promoted throughout the factory, thus greatly improving production efficiency. After Rubber Factory No. 4 promoted advanced experience, the number of returned products in the shoe vamp workshop was reduced by half, the qualified rate of rubber shoe quality increased to 99.61%, and the production cost was reduced by 9% compared with the original plan.

    Factories and Mines in the Southwest Region Further Revise Plans to Increase Production and Practice Economy

    The patriotic production increase and economy campaign in the industrial sector of the Southwest Region has been gradually deepening since it was launched in August. Most factories and mines have completed the revision of their production increase and economy plans, and some factories and mines are in the process of revising them. All the revised production increase and economy plans have greatly exceeded the figures set in January this year. For example, the increased production and savings figure set by Steel Plant 101 in January this year was 240 billion yuan for the whole year, but this time it was revised to 340 billion yuan. When revising the plans for increasing production and practicing economy, all factories and mines first solved some of the main problems existing in the factories. For example, Factory 201 of the mechanical system only paid attention to output in the past, ignoring quality, and the return rate of the spindles it produced was as high as 70%, and the scrap rate was 20%. They first solved this serious problem, basically eliminating the return phenomenon and reducing the scrap rate to 5%, before they began to revise the plan. Therefore, the revised plans are generally realistic.

    沈阳市修建大规模的职工住宅区
    随着生产迅速发展，工人不断增加，沈阳市开始修建大规模的新型职工住宅区——“工人村”。“工人村”占用土地的面积有七十三万多平方公尺，内分家属住宅区、独身宿舍区、社会及行政中心区和公园区等四部分。
    按照“工人村”的建设计划，在家属住宅区的中心将设立四个托儿所、六个幼稚园、两个小学校和浴室、合作社、诊疗所等。在社会及行政中心区的南面，将设立一座可容纳一万五千人的大型俱乐部，里面分设电影院、图书馆和跳舞厅。靠近俱乐部有运动场、游泳池。社会及行政中心区的附近，还建有住宅管理事务所、消防所、食堂和独身职工的宿舍。在家属住宅区和社会与行政中心区之间的三角地带，是一座大型的公园。一所能容纳一千一百多人的中学校将设立在这个公园里面。
    “工人村”中的所有住宅全是三层楼房，外观整洁美丽，内有被橱、电灯、上下水道、暖气、煤气等设备，庭院里还有小型仓库，供各家储藏杂物需用。
    沈阳已有八个国营工厂提前完成全年生产计划
    沈阳市已有八个国营工厂提前完成全年生产计划和增产节约计划。这八个工厂是：东北橡胶四厂、橡胶五厂、被服三厂、沈阳制烟厂、沈阳油漆厂、机电修配厂、苏家屯加工厂、石棉瓦厂。其中橡胶四厂已提出：到年底止，再为国家增产节约等于一万二千七百三十二吨粮食的财富。被服三厂也提出到年底要再增产节约三千吨粮食。上述各厂能够提前完成计划的主要原因，是在爱国增产节约竞赛运动中有领导、有组织、有计划地推广了先进生产经验。如被服三厂，四个月来，已在百分之九十以上的工人中推广了姜万寿创造的连续操作法和七项技术要领。全厂工人只在第三季度内就找出三百七十六件“窍门”，并从中总结出二十多项先进操作经验在全厂推广，因而大大提高了生产效率。橡胶四厂推广先进经验后，制帮车间的退修品减少了一半，胶鞋质量合格率提高到百分之九十九点六一，生产成本比原计划降低了百分之九。
    西南区各厂矿进一步修订增产节约计划
    西南区工业爱国增产节约竞赛运动，自八月份展开以来逐步深入，大部分厂矿已完成增产节约计划的修订工作，有的工厂矿山正在进行修订。凡是经过修订的增产节约计划，都大大超过了今年一月所订的数字。如一零一钢铁厂今年一月订的增产节约数字全年是二千四百亿元，这次修订后为三千四百亿元。各工厂矿山在修订增产节约计划时，都首先分别解决了一些厂内存在的主要问题。如机械系统的二○一厂过去只注意产量，忽视质量，制造的锭针退修率高到百分之七十，报废率达百分之二十。他们就先解决了这个严重问题，使退修现象基本消灭，报废率降到百分之五后，才开始修订。所以修订后的计划一般都是切合实际的。
