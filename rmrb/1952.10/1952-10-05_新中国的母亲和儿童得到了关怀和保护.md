    The Mothers and Children of New China are Receiving Care and Protection
    Secretary-General of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defence of Children

    The birth of the People's Republic of China signifies that the rights of women and children have begun to be guaranteed. The Common Program stipulates "attention should be paid to protecting the health of mothers, infants and children." The Chinese People's National Committee for the Defence of Children, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and its local organizations, adhering to the principle of serving the broad masses of manual and intellectual working women and their children, assist relevant departments of the People's Government and cooperate with relevant people's organizations to promote various undertakings for the protection of women and children. In the past three years, considerable achievements have been made.
    First of all, due to the development of national maternal and child health work, the broad masses of working women have gradually been liberated from the feudal, backward and unhygienic old-fashioned methods of delivery, reducing the pain of childbirth, saving many lives, and improving the health of mothers and children. Thanks to the establishment of more than 21,000 maternal and child health institutions across the country this year, more than 170,000 maternal and child health workers and midwives have received scientific training in delivery and disinfection methods (including more than 127,000 reformed old-style midwives). At the same time, relevant departments and organizations regularly conduct publicity and education on maternal and child health knowledge among the broad masses, which has greatly reduced the number of infant deaths from tetanus throughout the country. For example, in Dangshan County, Anhui Province, the infant mortality rate was 40% before liberation. After the implementation of new methods of delivery, the infant mortality rate has been reduced to an average of 12%, and in the county seat it has been reduced to 8%. More than 100 million children nationwide have been vaccinated against smallpox free of charge, reducing the number of people suffering from smallpox, and some cities have basically eliminated the epidemic of smallpox. In enterprises with more than 100 employees, due to the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, female workers are entitled to 56 days of maternity leave before and after childbirth, during which they receive their full wages. Female workers and their families can receive maternity subsidies when giving birth. From May to October 1951, for example, a total of 23.7 billion yuan in maternity subsidies had been issued nationwide. The employment of pregnant women has been guaranteed, and public employees receive free medical care, greatly improving the health of women and children. Recently, in order to reduce the mental threat to women during childbirth, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, piloted the method of mental-prophylactic painless childbirth among 3,376 people in 26 cities across the country, with 92.8% achieving painless childbirth. The promotion of this experience will allow millions of women to experience the greatness of science in their own childbirth, and they will shout their support from the bottom of their hearts!
    As the living standards of the working people have improved, the birth rate of children has also increased. Taking six state-owned textile factories in Tianjin as an example: in June of last year, female workers in these six factories gave birth to 297 children, 436 in August, and 522 in October, for a total of more than 2,000 children in half a year. New scenes of "prosperity of people and wealth" have emerged in urban factories and rural areas. As Qian Caiyin, a peasant who turned over in Hudong County, Anhui, said: "In the old society, life was impossible, and one only hoped not to have children. If they were born, they would have nothing to eat and would still starve to death. Now that the whole country is liberated, we have been given land and don't have to worry about food or clothing, so we must raise our children well."
    The development of childcare organizations not only ensures the health of children, but also enables mothers to participate in production, study and work with peace of mind. Zhang Shouyi's agricultural production mutual aid team, famous throughout the country, organized a childcare mutual aid team during the wheat harvest, adopting mutual assistance methods for cooking, feeding livestock, and delivering meals, thereby liberating women's labor force, enabling women to participate fully in production, and improving production efficiency. In the past, it took eight or nine days to complete the wheat harvest, but after organizing, it was completed in three and a half days. It also enables women to have the energy to participate in cultural and political studies and various activities together with men.
    This year, the number of such childcare mutual aid organizations in rural areas has increased more than fivefold compared to last year, enabling more than 370,000 mothers with children to participate in agricultural production.
    Other childcare centers in factories, mines, and urban public institutions are also gradually increasing, increasing fifteenfold compared to before 1949. And it is still increasing. Many factories, mining enterprises, and institutions have built new houses for childcare centers and kindergartens, and newly built workers' dormitories across the country have reserved space for building childcare centers and elementary schools. Wherever childcare centers, childcare stations, childcare rooms, or breastfeeding rooms have been established and are well-run, the work of female workers and female public employees has significantly improved, and their demands for learning have also increased. When Tangshan Huaxin Yarn Factory promoted the "1951 Weaving Method" during Red May this year, the mothers' team, because of the childcare organization, set two new records of producing no defective cloth, and 60 mothers became red flag bearers in the patriotic labor competition.
    With the development of childcare organizations, ordinary housewives who previously had no conditions to participate in social labor have now opened up a new career path. For example, the Hangzhou Municipal Democratic Women's Federation assisted the Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education in holding a training class for family women in preschool education, enabling 30 family women to return to their residential areas after a month of training and, based on the needs of the masses, open nine preschool classes by relying on the masses, enabling more than 300 children aged three to seven to receive collective education, changing the bad habits of children crying, rolling around, cursing, and not paying attention to hygiene in the past. And it enables the children's mothers to participate in production, study, and attend community meetings with peace of mind. In the cities, the operations of childcare centers, childcare stations, etc. are constantly being improved and upgraded, and some are already piloting Soviet all-round preschool education. In the past three years, the 202 training classes held nationwide and in various regions have cultivated 10,677 child care workers who are working together with medical personnel to establish and consolidate various childcare organizations, so that children can receive all-round preschool education.
    The People's Government's concern for the second generation of the motherland is also reflected in the orphans and vagrant children without parents. In the three years since liberation, the People's Government has taken over the "orphanages" and "relief homes" run by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government and American imperialism under the guise of charity in the past. Taking the Northeast as an example, the People's Government allocates 8,000 to 10,000 tons of grain every year as the funding for orphan education and upbringing. Today, the children living in these institutions, like the children in other childcare centers and elementary schools, live and study happily. If no one said anything, it would be difficult for anyone to imagine that these were once children who were ragged and wandering the streets, or who were yellow and thin, dying, and lived in orphanages run by American imperialism under the guise of charity a year or two ago. From the contrast between the suffering they suffered in the past and the warmth they receive today, these children deeply realize the lovableness of the motherland. As they themselves said: This is because we have the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government, so we are no longer orphans, but blessed children of the country.
    In the three years since liberation, women and children have received care and attention from the country in many ways. Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Dalian and other places have playgrounds, parks, cultural centers, reading rooms, etc. for children. In the elementary school of Hejiatang Village, Hang County, Zhejiang Province alone, playgrounds, slides, seesaws, as well as waist drums, harmoniums and projectors are equipped for the children, and there is also a small library. Many railway trains across the country have mother and child trains, and many factories attach importance to the nutrition and health of mothers and children.
    In the past three years, due to the vigorous development of women's and children's welfare work in New China, women's personal sufferings have gradually been reduced, and children's health has been improved, thereby gaining support from all aspects for women's and children's welfare work. For example, Zhao, an old man in his seventies in Tongxing District, Lianshui County, Northern Jiangsu, had seven children who died of "four-six wind" (neonatal tetanus) in the past. When he gave birth to his last child, because he adopted delivery disinfection methods, both mother and child were safe, and he automatically donated 15 jin of grain to the district to run a midwifery training class. He said: "This is a good thing. If the Communist Party had come earlier, I would have had grandchildren earlier." A mother with two children was deeply moved by the achievements of the emerging women's and children's welfare undertaking, and immediately donated 30 million yuan of her personal savings to express her respect and a mother's responsibility.
    Internationally, peace-loving people all over the world are also closely concerned about the women's and children's welfare undertaking in New China. At the International Children's Defence Conference held in Vienna in April this year, representatives from various countries listened to the report on the happy life of children in New China with envious eyes and excitement.
    Under the leadership of the wise leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the peace-loving Chinese people are warmly welcoming large-scale construction. With the development of national construction, children across the country will surely live a happier life. However, today our work is far from keeping up with the objective needs, and in the future we need to further improve and develop our work, vigorously promote delivery disinfection methods and parenting knowledge, and continue to establish and consolidate various childcare organizations to serve more working women and their children.

### 新中国的母亲和儿童得到了关怀和保护

    新中国的母亲和儿童得到了关怀和保护
    中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会秘书长  
    中华人民共和国的诞生，意味着妇女和儿童的权利开始得到了保障。共同纲领规定了“注意保护母亲、婴儿和儿童的健康。”中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会、中华全国民主妇女联合会及其地方组织，本着为广大体力劳动妇女、脑力劳动妇女及其子女服务的方针，协助人民政府的有关部门，并和有关的人民团体合作，推进各项保护妇女儿童的事业，三年来，获得了不少的成绩。
    首先，由于全国妇婴卫生工作的开展，使广大劳动妇女逐渐从封建落后的旧式接产和不卫生的境遇中，逐渐解放出来，减轻了生育的痛苦，挽救了不少的生命，增进了母子的健康。由于今年全国已建立了两万一千余处妇幼保健机构，有十七万多名妇幼保健员和接生员受过科学的接产消毒法的训练
    （包括十二万七千余名改造了的旧接生婆）。同时有关各部门各团体经常在广大群众中进行妇婴卫生知识的宣传教育工作，因而使全国婴儿患破伤风的死亡数字大大地降低。如安徽省砀山县的婴儿死亡率，在解放前为百分之四十。推行了新法接生后，婴儿死亡率已减到平均百分之十二，而该县县城则已减到百分之八。全国一亿以上的儿童得到免费种痘，使患天花病者减少，有些城市基本消灭了天花的流行。在有一百个职工以上的企业由于劳动保险条例的实施，女工在产前产后得到五十六天的休假，在休假期间，工资照发。女工及家属生育时可领到生育补助金。以一九五一年五月到十月为例，全国已发出的生育补助金达二百三十七亿元。孕妇职业得到了保障，公教人员获得免费医疗，大大增进了妇女儿童的健康。最近中央人民政府卫生部为了减少妇女生育中的精神威胁，在全国二十六个城市三千三百七十六人中，试行苏联的先进经验——精神预防性无痛分娩法的结果，其中百分之九十二点八获得了无痛分娩的成效。这个经验的推广将会使千百万妇女群众在自己的生育中体会科学的伟大，她们将从心底发出拥护的呼声！
    由于劳动人民的生活提高了，儿童出生率也随之增加。以天津六个国营纺织厂为例：去年六月这六厂女工生了二百九十七个小孩，八月生了四百三十六个，到十月就生了五百二十二个小孩，半年内共生了两千多小孩。在城市工厂、农村都出现了“人财两旺”的新气象。正如安徽湖东县一个翻身农民钱财印说：“在旧社会日子无法过，只望不要养孩子，养下来没有吃，还是要饿死，而今全国解放了，分了土地不愁吃，不愁穿，孩子就得好好地养他了。”
    托儿组织的发展，不但使孩子们的健康获得保障，并且使母亲得以安心参加生产、学习和工作。全国闻名的劳动模范张守义农业生产互助组，在麦收时，组织了看孩子互助组，把做饭、喂牲口、送饭等都采用了互助的办法，从而解放了妇女劳动力，使妇女能全力参加生产，提高了生产效率。过去麦收要八、九天才能完成，组织起来后，三天半就完成了。并使妇女有余力和男子一同参加文化和政治的学习以及各项运动。
    今年，在各地农村里像这样的托儿互助组织比去年增加了五倍以上。使三十七万多有孩子的母亲得以参加农业生产。
    其他如工厂矿山及城市公教人员托儿所也在逐渐增加中，今年比一九四九年前增加了十五倍。而且还在不断增加中。许多工厂矿山企业、机关都为托儿所、幼儿园修建了新房子，全国各地新建的工人宿舍里都留出了修建托儿所及小学校的地方。凡是已经举办托儿所，或托儿站，或托儿间，或哺乳室等，而且办得较好的地方，女工及女公教人员的工作就有显著的提高，而且学习要求也提高了。唐山华新纱厂今年红五月推广“一九五一织布工作法”时，妈妈组因为有了托儿组织，因而连创了两次不出次布的新纪录，在爱国主义劳动竞赛中，有六十个妈妈当了红旗手。
    随着托儿组织的发展，过去没有条件参加社会劳动的一般家庭妇女，现在也打开了一条新的职业门路。例如杭州市民主妇女联合会协助市人民政府文教局举办了一期家庭妇女幼儿教育训练班，使三十名家庭妇女经过一个月的训练后，回到自己住的地区，根据群众的需要，以依靠群众的办法，开办了九个幼儿班，使三百多个三岁到七岁的幼儿受到集体教育，改变了过去孩子们哭闹、打滚、骂人、不讲卫生等坏习惯。并且使儿童的母亲得以安心生产、学习、参加居民区的会议。在城市中，托儿所、托儿站等业务在不断的改进、提高着，有些已在试行苏联全面发展的幼儿教育。三年来，全国及各地举办的二百零二期训练班所培养出来的一万零六百七十七位保教人员也正在和医务人员一道，共同建立和巩固各种托儿组织，使儿童受到全面发展的学前教育。
    人民政府对于祖国第二代的关怀同样体现在无父母的孤儿和流浪儿身上。解放三年来，人民政府接管了过去蒋介石反动政府和美帝国主义假借慈善为名所办的“孤儿院”、“救济院”。以东北为例，人民政府每年拨出八千吨到一万吨的粮食，作为孤儿教养的经费。如今生活在这些机关里的孩子和其他托儿所、小学校的孩子一样，愉快地生活着、学习着。如果没有人讲的话，谁也难想到这就是曾经衣服褴褛流浪在街头的孩子，或是面黄肌瘦、奄奄一息、一两年前生活在美帝国主义假借慈善为名所办的孤儿院里的孩子，这些孩子从过去所受的痛苦和今天所得到的温暖的对比中深切地体会到祖国的可爱。正如他们自己所说：这是因为有了共产党，有了毛主席，有了人民政府，所以我们已不是孤儿，而是国家的福儿了。
    解放三年来，妇女和儿童得到了国家多方面的关怀和照顾。北京、上海、青岛、广州、旅大等地都为儿童设有游戏场、公园、文化馆、阅览室等，仅在浙江省杭县贺家塘村的小学校就为孩子们设备了操场、滑梯、跷板以及腰鼓、风琴和幻灯机，还设有小型图书馆。各地的铁路列车上很多都设有母子列车，很多工厂都重视了母亲和孩子的营养和健康。
    三年来，由于新中国的妇女儿童福利工作的蓬勃发展，逐渐减除了妇女的切身疾苦，增进了儿童的健康，从而得到各方面对妇女儿童福利工作的支持。例如苏北涟水县同兴区七十多岁的赵老先生过去有七个孩子都患四六风死了，当他生最后一个孩子时，因为采用了接产消毒法，使母子都得到平安，他便自动捐出十五斤粮食给区里办助产训练班。他说：“这是好事，共产党要早来，我就早抱孙子了。”一位有两个孩子的母亲，看到新兴的妇女儿童福利事业的成就，深受感动，立即捐出私人积蓄三千万元人民币，以表示她的敬意和母亲的一份责任。
    在国际上，全世界爱好和平的人民也密切关怀着新中国的妇女儿童福利事业，在今年四月在维也纳举行的国际保卫儿童大会上，各国代表都以羡慕的眼光，兴奋的心情，倾听着关于新中国儿童幸福生活的报告。
    热爱和平的中国人民，在英明的领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，正在热烈地迎接大规模建设。随着国家建设事业的发展，全国的儿童一定能过更加快乐幸福的生活。但是，今天我们的工作还远远赶不上客观的需要，今后还需更加改进和发展我们的工作，大力推广接产消毒法和育儿知识，继续建立和巩固各种托儿组织，为更多的劳动妇女及其子女服务。
