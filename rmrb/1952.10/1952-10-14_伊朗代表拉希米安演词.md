Due to my participation in this Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, I have personally witnessed that all representatives attending this conference have expressed their true and firm determination to defend peace and fight against imperialists and war-mongers without any fear, and this determination has made this conference a brilliant success.

I am deeply grateful to the great Chinese people and their respected leader Chairman Mao Zedong, who convened this conference and treated us with unparalleled warmth and friendship.

I pray for all freedom-loving people around the world, wishing them victory and glory.

Long live peace!

War-mongers are doomed to perish!

    伊朗代表拉希米安演词
    由于我们参加了这次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，我亲眼看到了所有出席这次会议的代表都毫无恐惧地表现了他们真正的和坚定的决心来保卫和平并且向帝国主义者和战争贩子们进行斗争，这种决心使这个会议获得了如此辉煌的成功。
    我深深感激伟大的中国人民和他们可敬的领袖毛泽东主席，是他们召集了这次会议并以无比的热诚与友爱来招待我们。
    我为了全世界爱好自由的人祈祷，祝他们胜利和光荣。
    和平万岁！
    战争贩子必定灭亡！
