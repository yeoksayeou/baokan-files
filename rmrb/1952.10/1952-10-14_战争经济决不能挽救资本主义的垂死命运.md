    American newspapers and publications have recently published some commentaries which, from various perspectives, irrefutably prove a universally significant fact in the current American domestic economic life: the stimulating effect of war on the American economy is gradually disappearing, industrial production is stagnating, and the path of economic militarization and one-sided development of military production sectors cannot eliminate the imbalance between production capacity and people's purchasing power; on the contrary, the situation of overproduction and production shrinkage is becoming more and more obvious, thus increasingly creating a serious economic crisis in the capitalist world.
    As everyone knows, Truman attempted to escape the maturing economic crisis by launching the bloody war of aggression against Korea, declaring a state of emergency at home, and putting the national economy on a war footing. People also clearly remember how elated the American bourgeois economists and propaganda machines were after the outbreak of the Korean War and how they touted their myth of "unlimited prosperity". However, as time went on, with the Korean War entering its third year, the serious consequences of economic militarization became increasingly apparent, even to "U.S. News & World Report".
    The fundamental reason for the stagnation of American industrial production lies in the shrinking social purchasing power. Because economic militarization not only means that more and more materials that could have been used for civilian production are consumed in military consumption and strategic stockpiling, but it also means that monopoly capitalists use tax increases to extract money from the people. All of these greatly reduce the people's purchasing power, decrease social demand for industrial and agricultural products, and drastically cut civilian production, thus creating a situation of overproduction and production stagnation.
    The current economic situation in the United States fully proves the correctness of Comrade Malenkov's analysis of the economic situation of capitalist countries at the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). American monopoly capitalists are attempting to use the militarization of the national economy to achieve their goal of escaping the approaching economic crisis. But as Malenkov pointed out: "The militarization of the national economy cannot eliminate the imbalance between production capacity and the ever-shrinking purchasing power of the people; on the contrary, it makes this imbalance even more serious. The ruling groups of capitalist countries are reducing the purchasing power of the people to a minimum, which makes the capacity of the capitalist market constantly shrink. Therefore, the expansion of military production will inevitably lead to a new and greater economic crisis." Comrade Malenkov's analysis has been confirmed by the situation of economic crisis in capitalist countries.

    战争经济决不能挽救资本主义的垂死命运
    美国的报纸刊物最近发表了一些评论，这些从各个不同角度出发的看法，无可辩驳地证明了目前美国国内经济生活中的一个具有普遍意义的事实：战争对美国经济的刺激作用正逐渐消失，工业生产停滞不前，经济军事化和军事生产部门片面发展的路线并不能消除生产能力和人民购买力之间的不平衡状态；相反的，生产过剩和生产萎缩的情况愈益明显，因而日益造成着资本主义世界的严重的经济危机。
    大家知道，杜鲁门曾以发动侵略朝鲜的血腥战争，在国内宣布紧急状态并把全国经济转上战争的轨道，来企图逃脱成熟中的经济危机。人们也还清楚地记得美国资产阶级的经济学家和宣传机器，在朝鲜战争爆发后是如何兴高采烈、是如何夸扬其“无限繁荣”的神话。但是随着时间的推移，在朝鲜战争已进入第三个年头的时候，经济军事化的严重的后果是愈来愈明显，甚至连“美国新闻与世界报道”也不得不承认了。
    美国工业生产停滞不前的根本原因在于社会购买力的日益缩减。因为经济军事化不仅意味着越来越多的本来可以用作民用生产的物资消耗在军事消费上和战略囤积上，同时也意味着垄断资本家用增税的手段来榨取人民的金钱，所有这些就使得人民购买力大大缩小、社会对工农业产品的需求日益下降、民用生产急剧削减，从而造成了生产过剩和生产停滞的情况。
    美国目前的经济局势完全证明了联共（布）第十九次代表大会上马林科夫同志对资本主义各国经济情况的分析的正确。美国垄断资本家是企图利用国民经济的军事化来达到其摆脱日益临近的经济危机的目的。但是正如马林科夫所指出的：“国民经济的军事化并不能消除生产能力和日益缩小的人民购买力之间的不平衡状态，相反地，它使这种不平衡状态更加严重了。资本主义国家的统治集团正把人民的购买力降低到最低限度，这就使得资本主义市场的容量不断缩小。因此，军事生产的扩张，必然会酿成新的更大的经济危机。”马林科夫同志的这一分析已被资本主义国家经济危机的形势所证实了。
