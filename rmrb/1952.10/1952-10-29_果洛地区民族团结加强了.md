    Strengthening National Unity in the Golog Region
    Ma Wanli, Deputy Head of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Golog Work Group
    Editor's Note: The Tibetan people of the Golog region have long suffered from the slaughter and instigation by the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Bufang bandits, and have harbored suspicions about the Han and Hui people. Internal disputes were also numerous. After liberation, the people's awareness gradually increased, but there were still some problems to be solved in social order and internal unity, and the Party and the People's Government's ethnic policies needed to be further implemented. To this end, the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee sent a work group to the Golog region. From August 24th to September 1st, the Golog Work Group held a friendship meeting of chieftains and representatives at the Chalong Temple, laying a preliminary foundation for enhancing local national unity, stabilizing social order, and implementing regional autonomy in the future. The article written by Deputy Head Ma Wanli reflects this situation. The original article was published in the Xi'an Masses Daily, and is now slightly revised and reprinted as follows.

    The Golog region, on the border of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Xikang, is a Tibetan-populated area. The area is vast and the terrain is high, with fertile grasslands, covering an area larger than Zhejiang Province. The areas we have visited and our current residence, Jidan, are all about 4,000 meters above sea level. The air in the highest areas is very thin, and the climate is unpredictable. Not only is there a large difference in temperature between day and night, but the temperature also varies greatly from place to place. For example, Chalong Temple and other places in Xiangqian Duoba are colder, and it starts to snow in June of the lunar calendar. Jidan, which is more than 40 miles east of Chalong Temple and close to Kangse and Golog Renyu in northwestern Sichuan, is very warm and can grow highland barley, wheat, peas, and vegetables. The vast pastoral areas are rich in cattle, sheep, fur, and corner hemp, rhubarb, as well as livestock products such as deer, bears, wild horses, musk, and hala. Due to the richness of the grasslands, the cattle and sheep produced are particularly fat and strong. Yaks weigh three or four hundred catties, and some even weigh six or seven hundred catties. Sheep weigh thirty or forty catties, and some even weigh sixty or seventy catties.

    The Tibetan people of the Golog region are one of the ethnic groups with a long history. However, due to the discrimination, oppression, plunder, and massacres by the reactionary rulers of past dynasties - the Manchu Qing government, the Northern Warlords, and the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Bufang bandits - the Tibetan people in the Golog region were extremely backward in politics, economy, and culture, their lives were extremely poor, and they were very disunited internally. The Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Bufang bandits implemented armed suppression against the Golog people. After being defeated by the Golog people, they imposed a long-term and malicious economic blockade on the Golog people, preventing them from obtaining essential supplies, making it impossible for the Golog people to sell their local products such as cattle, sheep, and fur. It also cut off the economic and cultural exchanges between the Golog people and their fraternal ethnic groups for a long time, to the extent that the tribal system has been preserved. Before the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Tibetan people of the Golog region had never enjoyed the warmth of the motherland.

    The peaceful resolution of the Tibet issue has had a great impact on the Tibetan people of the Golog region. In addition, the implementation of ethnic policies in the adjacent areas of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Xikang has gradually increased the awareness of the Tibetan people. At the request of the Golog people and with the help of the Central People's Government, the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee organized the Golog Work Group. After more than a month of long journey and overcoming many difficulties, we arrived at Chalong Temple in the heart of Golog in early August. Along the way, in addition to more than 10,000 yaks from Tibetan compatriots in Guide, Tongren, and Tongde helping us transport grain and supplies, we were warmly welcomed and supported by Golog Tibetan compatriots everywhere within the Golog region. Kang Wanqing, the chieftain of the Kangse tribe, Dan Zengjianmu Cuo, the chieftain of Gongma, and Ranluo, the chieftain of Ranluo, came to welcome us at Laji Temple and Geke, several "ma stations" away, helped us lead the way, and prepared fuel, greatly reducing the difficulties in our journey. After arriving at Chalong Temple, the entire monks of the temple and Nianmao Temple, wearing the latest clothes, welcomed us with the most solemn religious ceremonies. The temple helped us solve the difficulty of storing grain. The Tibetan compatriots of the Mobab Tribe returned our lost mules from two "stations" away after they had been missing for a week.

    The task of the Work Group is to represent Chairman Peng, Vice Chairmen Xi and Zhang of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee, to express sympathy to the Golog people, to publicize the ethnic policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government, to assist the Golog people in stabilizing social order, strengthening national unity, carrying out medical and trade work, and preparing to promote national regional autonomy. With the consent of the chiefs, a joint meeting of chieftains and representatives from all of Golog was held on August 24th, with 417 people attending. The attendees came from all different corners. Among them, many chieftains were not harmonious with each other, and even had grievances, due to the instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Bufang bandits. However, under the influence of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, all past disharmony and resentment were quickly diluted. Yi Xin Wangjie and Dan Zengjianmu Cuo, who were fighting each other, ceased fighting and made peace after being persuaded by the Work Group. The meeting was conducted in an atmosphere of unity throughout. The nine-day meeting not only fully demonstrated the Golog Tibetan compatriots' sincere support for Chairman Mao's policies, but also adopted resolutions on national unity and stabilizing social order. The chieftains and representatives of each tribe signed and sealed the resolution, determined to strengthen national unity, resolutely eliminate foreign counter-revolutionaries, and stabilize social order. In order to protect the safety of the Work Group's transportation, the chieftains voluntarily proposed that each tribe send people to escort the Work Group in sections. At the same time, it was proposed that on the fifth day of the eighth lunar month, all the chieftains would be at the Work Group's residence to mediate major disputes in Golog, thus making the meeting a success.

    In the short time since arriving in Golog, although we have done some work and gained some experience, this is only the beginning of our work. The tasks entrusted to us by the Party and the People's Government are arduous and great. Future work will be more complex and arduous. In order to thoroughly implement the ethnic policies of the Party and the People's Government in the Golog region, we must better grasp the policy of "more cautious and steady progress." We guarantee that we will work better in the future.

    果洛地区民族团结加强了
    西北军政委员会果洛工作团副团长　马万里
    编者按：果洛区藏族人民曾长期遭受蒋马匪帮的屠杀和挑拨，对汉、回族人民有疑惧心理，内部纠纷也很多。解放后，人民觉悟逐渐提高，但社会治安和内部团结上仍然有些问题需要解决，党和人民政府的民族政策还需要继续贯彻。为此，西北军政委员会派遣了工作团到果洛区工作。从八月二十四日至九月一日，果洛工作团在查郎寺召开头人、代表联谊会，对增进当地民族团结和安定社会秩序以及将来实行区域自治，打下了初步基础。马万里副团长写的这篇文章，反映了这种情况。原文发表于西安群众日报，现稍加修改，转载如后。
    在青海、甘肃、四川、西康边境的果洛区，是藏族聚居的地区。这里地区辽阔，地势又高，有着肥沃的草原，面积比浙江省还大。我们已到过的地区和现在的住地吉旦，平地都拔海有四千公尺左右。最高地带空气很稀薄，气候变化无常。不仅昼夜温度相差很大，各地温度相差也很大。例如：巷千多巴的查郎寺等地较冷，到农历六月时就开始下雪；东距查郎寺四十余里的吉旦，靠近四川西北的康赛、果洛仁玉一带就非常暖和，可以种植青稞、小麦、豌豆、蔬菜等。广大游牧区，盛产牛、羊、皮毛及角麻、大黄，还有鹿、熊、野马、麝香、哈拉等畜产。由于草原丰美，所产牛、羊特别肥壮。牦牛重三四百斤，还有六七百斤的；羊重三四十斤，还有六七十斤的。
    果洛地区藏族是有悠久历史的民族之一。但是，由于历代反动统治者——满清政府、北洋军阀、蒋马匪帮的歧视、压迫、掠夺和屠杀，使果洛地区藏民在政治、经济、文化上异常落后，生活极端贫困，内部很不团结。蒋马匪帮对果洛人民实行武装镇压，被果洛人民击败之后，又对果洛人民实行长期而恶毒的经济封锁，不让果洛人民得到生活必需品，使果洛土产牛、羊、皮毛卖不出去。并使果洛人民长期和外界兄弟民族断绝了经济与文化的交流，以至一直保存着部落制度。果洛区藏族人民在中华人民共和国成立之前，从来没有享受过祖国的温暖。
    西藏问题和平解决，对果洛地区藏民的影响很大，再加上在青海、甘肃、四川、西康毗邻的地区推行了民族政策，藏民的觉悟渐渐提高。在果洛人民的要求与中央人民政府的帮助下，西北军政委员会组织了果洛工作团。经过了一个多月的长途跋涉，克服了许多困难，于八月上旬到达果洛腹地查郎寺。沿途除贵德、同仁、同德等地藏胞用万余牦牛帮助我们运输粮食及物资外，在果洛境内处处受到果洛藏胞对我们的热烈欢迎和拥护。康赛族土官康万庆、贡麻土官旦曾尖木错、然洛土官然洛等到几马站远的路程上——拉加寺、格科来迎接我们，帮助我们带路、准备燃料，大大减少了我们行进中的困难。到达查郎寺后，该寺及年毛寺的全体僧众，穿着最新的衣服，用宗教上最隆重的仪式来欢迎我们。寺院帮助我们解决存放粮食的困难。莫坝部落的藏民同胞们，将我们遗失一周的骡子，从两站远的路上给我们送回来。
    工作团的任务，是代表西北军政委员会彭主席，习、张副主席，慰问果洛人民、宣传共产党和人民政府的民族政策，协助果洛人民，安定社会秩序，加强民族团结，展开医疗、贸易工作，准备推行民族区域自治。经各头目人同意，八月二十四日召开了全果洛的头人、代表联谊会议，到会人员四百一十七人。到会的人员，来自各个不同的角落。其中许多头人，因蒋马匪帮的挑拨，相互间是不够和睦的，甚至是有仇怨的。但是，在毛主席民族政策的感召下，过去的一切不和睦和怨恨，很快地就被冲淡了。正在出兵厮杀的一心王杰与旦曾尖木错，经工作团劝说后，息战言和了。会议始终在团结的气氛中进行。九天的会议，不但充分表示了果洛藏胞竭诚拥护毛主席的政策，而且通过了民族团结和安定社会秩序等决议案。各部落头人、代表，都在这个决议案上签了名、盖了章，决心加强民族团结，坚决肃清外来反革命、安定社会秩序。为了保护工作团运输安全，各头人自动提出，各部落派人分段护送。同时提出：农历八月五日，各头人全部在工作团驻地调解果洛的重大纠纷，从而使会议顺利成功。
    在到达果洛的短时间中，我们虽然做了些工作，取得了一些经验，但是，这仅仅是工作的开端。党和人民政府交给我们的任务，是艰巨而伟大的。今后的工作将更复杂繁重。为了使党和人民政府的民族政策彻底在果洛区贯彻，我们就必须更好地掌握
    “更加慎重稳进”的方针。我们保证今后要更好地工作。
