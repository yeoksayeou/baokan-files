    New Look of Economic Life for People in Northeast China
    Chen Xin
    The development of industrial and agricultural production and the active exchange of goods between urban and rural areas have unprecedentedly increased the purchasing power of the people in Northeast China. This year, the purchasing power of the entire Northeast region has reached 3.95 times that of 1949. The people of Northeast China have forever shaken off the impoverished life of the colonial and semi-colonial era, and a happy and prosperous new atmosphere, unprecedented in history, is unfolding before them.

    Due to the increase in purchasing power, the people of Northeast China are demanding a greater quantity of goods, higher quality, and more varieties. This can be clearly seen from the sales statistics of state-owned commercial enterprises. In the first half of this year, the total sales value of state-owned trade increased by 157.8% compared with the same period last year, 248.5% compared with the same period the year before, and was equivalent to 14.79 times that of the same period in 1949. The commodities managed by state-owned trade were less than 3,000 kinds in 1949, but have now increased to more than 50,000 kinds, but still cannot fully meet the needs of the people.

    From the following examples, we can see the new look of the economic life of the working people in Northeast China.

    Zheng Xiangfeng, a worker at the Shenyang Railway Factory, is a mid-level skilled worker. During the puppet Manchukuo period, his family of seven lived on acorn flour, bean cakes, and wild vegetable paste all day long. At that time, the family had only two tattered quilts, and each person had only one piece of clothing that had been patched over and over again. During the Kuomintang rule, his family's life was equally miserable, forcing his wife to take five children and beg along the road, returning to their old home inside the customs. After the liberation of Shenyang in November 1948, production quickly recovered, and Zheng Xiangfeng's life quickly changed. In 1949, he brought his family back to Shenyang, and at that time they were already able to eat sorghum rice. In 1950, they could eat one-third of fine grains. Last year, they could eat three-quarters of fine grains. This year, the whole family often eats rice and white flour, and only occasionally eats some coarse grains. In the past, when his wife gave birth, she never ate eggs. Last year, she gave birth again, and not only ate many eggs, but also stewed several old hens to eat. This year, every few days, Zheng Xiangfeng always buys some biscuits, candies, pastries, and fruits for his children. Now the whole family of eight has an average of seven sets of clothes and one quilt per person. He also bought a radio.

    Zheng Xiangfeng's family's life is like this, and so is the life of other people. According to statistics, the amount of fine grains consumed by the people of Northeast China was less than 10% of the total grain in 1949, but in the first eight months of this year, it has increased to 40%; the amount of non-staple foods such as eggs and pork has increased more than tenfold compared with 1949.

    "Raise strong horses, build houses with bricks and tiles, buy printed cloth and gabardine, and use rubber tires for carts." This new folk song shows the prosperous life of the rural people. On September 6th this year, the Wang Ximing Agricultural Production Cooperative (23 households) in Minji Village, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, collectively purchased 3,860 chi of cloth (bedding material accounted for one-third), an average of 33.5 chi of new cloth (including infants less than one month old) per person. And this expense only accounts for one-tenth of their sideline income plan. Let's take a look at the situation in Erdaogou Village, Yongji County, Jilin Province, which created the experience of agricultural production mutual aid groups signing "combination contracts" with supply and marketing cooperatives: female students wear white shirts, dark blue overalls, and colorful ribbons tied on their braids. The vast majority of male students wear blue twill uniforms. The silver caps of their fountain pens gleam at the edges of their pockets. During the summer hoeing season, farmers bring thermos bottles to the fields, wear rubber shoes when it rains, and hold flashlights when going out at night or tending livestock. Their yards are planted with flowers and plants, 95% of the houses have glass windows installed, and more than 50% of the people have whitewashed the interior walls. According to statistics this spring, the number of livestock in this village has increased from 216 at the time of the land reform to 478; the number of vehicles has increased from 34 to 64 (including 15 rubber-wheeled vehicles); the number of pigs has increased from 119 to 1,191; and the number of chickens and ducks has increased from 400 to 4,367. What I have mentioned above are just examples from rural areas in ordinary crop areas. The speed of improvement in the lives of farmers in cash crop areas is even faster. According to a survey of several villages in the cotton-producing areas of Liaoxi Province, cotton farmers are not only well-fed and clothed, but also 13% of the households repaired or built new houses last year, and about 40% of the households repaired or built new houses this year. Many of the newly built houses have stone foundations, brick walls, and tiled roofs, and the rooms are also laid with floors and installed with glass windows. Every household plants various flowers and plants in their yards and in front of their windows.

    The people who have turned over politically and economically are eagerly demanding a cultural transformation. Taking Balicun Village in Jin County, under the jurisdiction of Dalian City, as an example, the village, like other villages, responded to the call of the People's Government in 1949 and established a cultural station. Under the leadership of the cultural station, amateur troupes often perform programs and hold entertainment evenings once a week. The village is now actively promoting the rapid literacy method, requiring everyone to recognize more than 1,500 characters. The whole village has a library, eleven radio listening groups, nine newspaper reading groups, and subscribes to more than 130 copies of the "Luda People's Daily" and more than 80 copies of the "Luda Farmers' Daily." Sports activities under the leadership of the cultural station have developed. Last year, many young farmers began playing volleyball and soccer. Now, every Sunday or Saturday, these farmer athletes play soccer games with workers from Wulicun Village or the Jin County Textile Factory.

    Looking at this newborn scene, looking at this happy life, how can the people of Northeast China not sincerely say: "Thank the Communist Party, thank Chairman Mao!"

    "Follow the Communist Party, follow Chairman Mao!"

    东北人民经济生活的新面貌
    陈新
    工农业生产的发展和城乡物资交流的活跃，使东北人民的购买力空前地提高了。今年东北全区的购买力已达到一九四九年的三点九五倍。东北人民已经永远摆脱了殖民地与半殖民地时代的贫困生活，他们面前展现出一幅空前未有的、幸福康乐的新气象。
    由于购买力的提高，东北人民要求的商品的数量增大了，质量提高了，品种加多了。这从国营商业销售统计表上可以明显地看出来。今年上半年国营贸易销货总值比去年同期提高了百分之一五七点八，比前年同期提高了百分之二四八点五，等于一九四九年同期的十四点七九倍。国营贸易经营的商品，在一九四九年还不满三千种，现在已增加到五万种以上，但是还不能充分满足人民的需要。
    我们从下面几个例子，可以看出东北劳动人民经济生活的新面貌。
    沈阳铁路工厂的工人郑祥凤，是一个中等技术工人。伪满时，他全家七口人，终日以橡子面、豆饼和野菜糊口，那时全家只有两床破烂不堪的被子，每人只有一件补了又补的衣裳。国民党统治时期，他家的生活是同样的苦，逼得他老婆带着五个孩子，沿路求乞，返回关内老家。一九四八年十一月沈阳解放后，生产迅速恢复，郑祥凤的生活很快就变样了。一九四九年他把全家接回沈阳，那时已能吃上高粱米了。一九五○年能吃三分之一的细粮。去年能吃四分之三的细粮。今年全家经常吃大米、白面，偶然才吃一些粗粮。他的妻子过去生孩子，从来没有吃过鸡蛋，去年又生了孩子，不但吃了许多鸡蛋，还炖了几只老母鸡吃。今年，隔不几天，郑祥凤总要给孩子们买些饼干、糖果、点心和水果。现在全家八口人，平均每人有七套衣服和一床被褥。他还买了一架收音机。
    郑祥凤家的生活是这样，其他人的生活也是这样。据统计，全东北人民食用细粮的数量，一九四九年不足粮食总量的百分之十，今年前八个月已增加到百分之四十；鸡蛋、猪肉等副食品的食用量，则比一九四九年增加了十多倍。
    “养畜要壮马，盖房用砖瓦，买布花达呢，拴车要胶皮。”这支新歌谣表现出农村人民生活富裕的面貌。黑龙江省绥化县民吉村王喜明农业生产合作社（二十三户）在今年九月六日那一天，集体购买了三千八百六十尺布（被褥材料占三分之一），平均每人添买新布（连没满月的小孩在内）三十三尺五寸。而这笔化费只占他们副业计划收入的十分之
    一。再看看创造了农业生产互助组与供销合作社签订“结合合同”经验的吉林省永吉县二道沟村的情况吧：女学生们穿着白色衬衫，深蓝色工装长裤，发辫上扎着彩色缎带。男学生们绝大部分穿着蓝斜纹布制服。他们的自来水钢笔的银帽在衣袋口边闪闪发光。夏锄期间，农民带着暖水瓶下地，下雨时候穿着胶鞋，夜晚出外或照料牲口时拿着手电筒。他们的院里种着花草，百分之九十五的房子安上玻璃窗，百分之五十以上的人家用白粉刷了里墙。根据今年春天的统计，这村大小牲口已由土地改革时的二百十六头增加为四百七十八头；车辆由三十四辆增为六十四辆（其中胶皮车占十五辆）；猪由一百一十九只增到一千一百九十一只；鸡、鸭由四百只增为四千三百六十七只。前面所说的只是普通作物区农村的例子。经济作物区农民生活提高的速度就更快了。据辽西省产棉区几个村的调查，棉农不仅丰衣足食，去年还有百分之十三的农户修理或盖了新房子，今年有百分之四十左右的人家修理或盖了新房子。新盖的房子不少是石基、砖墙、瓦顶的，屋内还铺上地板和安装了玻璃窗，家家院子窗前都种着各种各样花草。
    政治上、经济上翻了身的人民，是迫切地要求文化翻身的。以旅大市所属金县八里村为例，该村和其他村一样，在一九四九年响应人民政府号召，建立了文化站。在文化站领导下，业余剧团经常演出节目，每周开一次娱乐晚会。该村现正积极推广速成识字法，要求所有的人都能认识一千五百字以上。全村有一个图书馆、十一个收音组、九个读报组，订了一百三十多份旅大人民日报，八十多份旅大农民报。文化站领导下的体育活动发展起来了，去年许多青年农民就开始打排球、踢足球了。现在每逢礼拜日或礼拜六，这些农民运动员就同五里村或金县纺织工厂工人进行足球赛。
    看看这新生的景象，看看这幸福的生活，东北人民怎能不由衷地说：“感谢共产党，感谢毛主席！”
    “跟着共产党走，跟着毛主席走！”
