    Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Resolution on National Independence

    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference firmly believes that peace and national independence are inseparable. If any country's territory and sovereignty are violated, peace is threatened. Therefore, to safeguard peace, the sovereign independence and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected and inviolable, and the right and freedom of all peoples to determine their own political system and way of life must be guaranteed, without allowing interference in any form or under any pretext. Countries with different political systems and ways of life can coexist peacefully. These goals are in line with the principles set forth in the United Nations Charter and the actions taken by the World Peace Council on the issue of national independence.

    This conference is extremely concerned about the increasingly serious threat to the national independence of several countries in the region, considering this a threat to peace. Some countries are suffering from foreign military aggression; some countries have been forced to participate in aggression against other countries; some countries are occupied by foreign aggressive troops and forced to provide military bases; the internal affairs and economic sovereignty of some countries have been subjected to foreign control; and more countries have become victims of economic blockade and cultural oppression, thus being deprived of the freedom to maintain and develop economic and cultural relations with other countries.

    This conference believes that such tyrannical policies are a violation of the national independence of other countries and a threat to world peace. This conference believes that guaranteeing national independence is a necessary condition for strengthening lasting peace. This conference supports the just struggle for national independence and proposes the following ways to achieve peace:

    One, respect the sovereign independence and territorial integrity of all countries; resolutely oppose any act by one country to undermine the territorial integrity of another country and interfere in its internal affairs.

    Two, immediately stop the wars of aggression being waged in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and other countries; all foreign troops must withdraw from the aforementioned countries.

    Three, withdraw occupying forces stationed in Japan and foreign troops stationed in other countries; abolish military bases established by one country in other countries; stop the increasingly intensified militarization; abolish all kinds of aggressive treaties aimed at inciting war.

    Four, respect the right of all countries to develop and utilize their own natural resources, freely exchange these resources with other countries, and use these resources entirely to improve the living conditions of the people and develop peaceful economies; resolutely oppose one country seizing the natural resources of other countries.

    Five, oppose all blockade and embargo measures; respect free trade between countries and between peoples based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit.

    Six, oppose all activities that promote racial discrimination and sow discord among nations, as well as all malicious propaganda that incites war; respect the freedom of religious belief of all peoples and the freedom to develop their own culture and maintain cultural exchanges with other countries.

    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference calls on the people of all countries to help each other and work together to achieve the above goals; this conference earnestly hopes that the people of the United States, Britain, and France will give support and cooperation to this struggle.

                            October 12, 1952, Beijing

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    关于民族独立问题的决议
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议坚信：和平与民族独立是分不开的。如果任何一国的领土和主权受到侵犯，和平也就受到了威胁。因此，为了保障和平，各国的主权独立与领土完整必须受到尊重而不容侵犯，各国人民决定自己政治制度与生活方式的权利和自由必须受到保障，而不容许以任何形式或任何藉口加以干涉；不同政治制度和不同生活方式的国家可以和平共处。这些目标是符合于联合国宪章所提出的原则与世界和平理事会关于民族独立问题所采取的行动的。
    本会议极端关心本区域若干国家的民族独立日益受到威胁的严重情况，认为这是对于和平的威胁。有些国家正遭受外国的军事侵略；有些国家被迫参加了对其他国家的侵略；有些国家被外国侵略军队所占领并被迫提供军事基地；有些国家的内政与经济的主权已遭受外国的控制；更多的国家已成为经济封锁与文化压迫的牺牲品，因而被剥夺了与其他国家维持并发展经济与文化关系的自由。
    本会议认为这种横暴的政策是对其他国家民族独立的侵犯，对世界和平的威胁。本会议认为保障民族独立是加强持久和平的必要条件。本会议支持争取民族独立的正义斗争，并提出下列实现和平的办法：
    一、尊重一切国家的主权独立和领土完整；坚决反对一国破坏他国领土完整和干涉他国内政的任何行为。
    二、立即停止在朝鲜、越南、马来亚及其他国家进行的侵略战争；一切外国军队必须撤出上述国家。
    三、撤退驻在日本的占领军以及驻在其他国家的外国军队；取消一个国家在其他国家建立的军事基地；停止日益加紧的军国主义化；废除旨在煽动战争的各种侵略条约。
    四、尊重各国开发并利用本国天然资源，与其他国家自由交换这些资源并把这些资源完全用来改善人民生活条件与发展和平经济的权利；坚决反对一个国家夺取他国的天然资源。
    五、反对一切封锁、禁运的措施；尊重各国间和各国人民间根据平等互利的原则进行自由的贸易。
    六、反对一切鼓吹种族歧视和在各民族间挑拨离间的活动，以及一切煽动战争的恶意宣传；尊重各国人民的宗教信仰自由和发展本国文化及与他国保持文化交流的自由。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议号召各国人民互相帮助，为实现上述各项目标而共同奋斗；本会议更热烈希望美国、英国、法国的人民对这个斗争，给予支持与合作。
                            一九五二年十月十二日于北京
