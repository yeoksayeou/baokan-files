Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: General Nam Il, chief representative of our side at the Korean armistice negotiations, lodged a serious protest with the other side on the 16th regarding the U.S. side's barbaric actions of continuously slaughtering our captured personnel after unilaterally suspending the armistice negotiations. The full text of General Nam Il's protest is as follows:

To Lieutenant General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

On October 12th, your side killed two of our captured personnel on Jeju Island; on October 13th and 14th, your side wounded eleven of our captured personnel on Geoje Island. I hereby lodge a serious protest with you regarding this. The recent endless stream of atrocities committed by your side against prisoners of war shows that after suspending the armistice negotiations, your side is determined to adopt various barbaric methods to create excuses for your refusal to repatriate prisoners of war, and to obstruct the rational resolution of the POW issue, which is currently the only obstacle to the Korean armistice. Your side should know that every atrocity your side commits against our captured personnel will only lead to a more complete bankruptcy of all your excuses for refusing to repatriate prisoners of war. Your side cannot escape the serious responsibility for deliberately sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations and plotting to expand the Korean War.

General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation
October 16, 1952

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: According to an announcement by the U.S. side, two more captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were killed in the U.S. 3A POW camp on Jeju Island on the 12th. In order to shirk responsibility, the U.S. side said that they "hanged themselves" and that it was "obviously suicide." However, the U.S. side has consistently refused to explain what caused the continuous "hanging suicide" incidents in U.S. POW camps. This is obviously because such an explanation would undoubtedly expose the U.S. side's lawless crimes in the POW camps.

As everyone knows, the 3A POW camp on Jeju Island is where the U.S. side detains so-called "cooperative anti-communist" prisoners of war. On October 1st, all the prisoners of war in this POW camp used actions celebrating the motherland's National Day to show that they were not, as the U.S. side said, "willing to commit suicide rather than be repatriated," but were resolutely opposed to being forcibly detained and resolutely demanded repatriation. In order to suppress the expression of this free will by the prisoners of war, the U.S. side killed and wounded 165 prisoners of war on that day. Since then, the U.S. side has obviously stepped up the process of creating "cooperative anti-communist" prisoners of war with bayonets. Although the world has no way of knowing whether the two prisoners of war who died in the Jeju Island POW camp on the 12th died on the U.S. gallows or under the torture and coercion of U.S. special agents, their deaths once again exposed the bloody inside story of the U.S.'s so-called "humanitarian principles." For those diplomats like Pearson who are selling out their sovereignty and conscience by echoing the absurd principles of the United States in the United Nations General Assembly, this is a bloody accusation.

    我方抗议美方中止谈判后连续屠杀战俘
    【新华社开城十六日电】朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军，在十六日就美方在片面中止停战谈判后连续屠杀我方被俘人员的野蛮行动，向对方提出严重抗议。南日将军抗议全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊中将：
    十月十二日，你方在济州岛害死我方被俘人员二人；十月十三日、十四日，你方在巨济岛打伤我方被俘人员十一人。对此我向你提出严重抗议。最近你方层出不穷地虐杀战俘的罪行，显示你方在中止停战谈判之后，决心采取各种野蛮办法来制造你方拒绝遣返战俘的藉口，阻挠目前唯一阻碍朝鲜停战的遣俘问题的合理解决。你方应该知道，你方对我方被俘人员所进行的每一次暴行，只能使你方拒绝遣返战俘的一切藉口趋于更加彻底的破产。你方不能逃脱蓄意破坏朝鲜停战谈判，阴谋扩大朝鲜战争的严重责任。

    中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军
    一九五二年十月十六日
    【新华社开城十六日电】据美方宣布，十二日在济州岛美方三A战俘营中又有两名中国人民志愿军被俘人员被杀害。为了推卸责任，美方说他们是“吊死”的，并且说“显然是自杀的”。但是美方始终不敢说明，在美方战俘营中接连不断发生战俘“上吊自尽”事件，究竟是由于什么原因。这显然是因为这样的说明无疑会暴露出美方在战俘营中的无法无天的罪行。
    大家知道，济州岛上的三A战俘营是美方拘留所谓“合作反共”的战俘的地方。十月一日，这个战俘营里的全体战俘用庆祝祖国国庆的行动，表明了他们并不是如美方所说的“宁愿自杀也要拒绝遣返”，而是坚决反对被强迫扣留，坚决要求遣返的。为了镇压战俘的这种自由意志的表现，美方在那天打死打伤了一百六十五名战俘。从那时以后，美方显然加紧了用刺刀制造“合作反共”战俘的过程。全世界虽然无从知道，十二日在济州岛战俘营中死亡的两名战俘，究竟是死在美方的绞刑架上还是死于美方特务人员的酷刑威逼之下，但是他们的死再一次揭穿了美方所谓“人道原则”的血腥内幕。对于那些正在联合国大会上附和美国荒谬原则的出卖主权和良心的外交家如皮尔逊之流，这是一个血的控诉。
