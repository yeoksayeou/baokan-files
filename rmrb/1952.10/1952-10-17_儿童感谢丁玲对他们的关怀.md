    Children Thank Ding Ling for Her Concern
    Respected Comrade Ding Ling: We are children from Southeast Township, Zuoquan County, Shanxi Province, and we are currently studying at Cheng Guan North Street Complete Primary School. Our fathers and older brothers work in the Zuoquan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. We study at school during the day and sleep in the office at night, and we are very happy. On the evening of September 13th, Comrade Liu Fuhuai, who works in the County Committee, read us a passage from the newspaper. It said that Comrade Ding Ling had donated her entire Stalin Prize money to the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to be used for children's welfare. We were so happy to hear that. We think that all the children in the country will be happy to know this news. When we heard Comrade Liu Fuhuai read, "The All-China Women's Federation has obtained Ding Ling's consent and decided to use one-fifth of the donation as prize money for excellent children's literary works, and the rest will be used to purchase slide projectors and slides to be distributed to rural areas with emphasis..." we jumped up with joy and shouted together, "Thank you, Comrade Ding Ling, for your concern for us!"
    We will try our best to publicize this good news to our friends. When we go home for the autumn holiday, we will tell our mothers, younger brothers, and younger sisters, so that they will know that we are happier every day under the leadership of Chairman Mao. We will study hard and be good students of Chairman Mao.

    儿童感谢丁玲对他们的关怀
    敬爱的丁玲同志：我们是山西省左权县东南乡的儿童，现在城关北街完全小学念书。我们的父亲、哥哥在中共左权县委员会工作，我们白天在学校念书，黑夜在机关里睡觉，日子过得十分快乐。九月十三日晚上，在县委会工作的刘伏怀同志给我们念了一段报，他说丁玲同志把全部斯大林奖金捐给中华全国民主妇女联合会，准备用在儿童福利事业方面了。我们听了之后，是多么高兴啊。我们想，全国儿童知道了这个消息，都是高兴的。当我们听到刘伏怀同志念到“全国妇联已征得丁玲同意，决定把捐款五分之一作为优秀的儿童文艺读物的奖金，其余用来购买幻灯机和幻灯片有重点地转发到农村去……”的时候，我们都高兴得跳了起来，一起高喊“感谢丁玲同志对我们的关怀！”
    我们要把这个好消息尽量向小朋友们宣传。放了秋假回家告诉我们的母亲和小弟弟、小妹妹们，让他们知道：我们在毛主席领导下，一天比一天更快乐。我们要努力学习，当毛主席的好学生。
