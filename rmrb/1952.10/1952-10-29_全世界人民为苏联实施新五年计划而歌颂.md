Since the "Pravda" of the Soviet Union published the draft instructions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Fifth Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union on August 20th, a great document of world significance, the working people and peace-loving people all over the world have been elated. Everyone unanimously praised the superiority of the Soviet socialist system once again, praised the happy life of the Soviet people, and praised the unparalleled strength of the peace and democracy camp and its great contribution to the cause of world peace.

I. The Basic Tasks of the New Soviet Five-Year Plan

The main points of this five-year plan are to increase the production level in industry by about 70 percent during the five-year period. Compared with 1950, the output of important industrial products will increase: pig iron by 76 percent, steel by 62 percent, coal by 43 percent, oil by 85 percent, and electricity by 80 percent. Labor productivity in all sectors will also be greatly improved. In agriculture, the total grain harvest will increase by 40 to 50 percent, raw cotton by 55 to 65 percent, and other crops such as flax fiber, sugar beet, potatoes, sunflower, grapes, tobacco, and high-grade green tea will increase from 40 to 75 percent. The output of various feeds will increase from 80 percent to four times, and the yield per hectare will be increased. Based on the increase in industrial and agricultural output, retail trade in state-owned and cooperative stores will also increase by nearly 70 percent in five years. Various transportation tools and capabilities on land, sea and air will also be increased accordingly. Strenuous work in industry, agriculture and transportation will move towards mechanization and automation. On the basis of the steady increase in socialist production and the increase in social labor productivity, the material welfare, public health and cultural level of the people will be further improved.

II. The Superiority of the Soviet Socialist System Once Again

We all know that since the victory of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has established an unprecedented socialist country on one-sixth of the earth's area. This country has been advancing from victory to victory, overcoming the conspiracies and attacks of reactionary forces at home and abroad, and changing the dilapidated situation left over from the Tsarist era. One five-year plan after another has been completed ahead of schedule and exceeding targets. After the Second World War destroyed the crazy attacks of the German fascist bandits, by the fourth five-year plan, not only was the war's wounds quickly healed, but industrial output also exceeded the 1940 level by 73 percent. Now the fifth five-year plan has been on the historical agenda for two years, and there is no doubt about its inevitability of victory. In the struggle of more than 30 years, the Soviet people have not only consolidated the Soviet socialist system, but also opened up an infinitely broad road for the liberation struggle of the people of the world. Where is the main key to this? It is that the Soviet people, under the wise and outstanding leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, have carried out heroic and arduous struggles, seized political power, and occupied the means of production, so that the national economy can be developed in a balanced manner according to a certain plan, and the national human and material resources can be used in the most rational and effective way, so that the objectively existing socialist economic laws can be used freely on the basis of the conscious awareness of the working people. This is something that is impossible in countries with capitalist economic systems. In his report to the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Malenkov said: "In 1951, the industrial output of the Soviet Union was 1,266 percent of that in 1929, an increase of almost 13 times in this period. Soviet industry, like before the war, has been continuously developing upward on the basis of developing peaceful production. ... The industrial production of the United States stagnated in the period from 1929 to 1939, and then made progress, but this was only caused by the surge in military production during the Second World War; later, it declined sharply, and only after the United States launched a war against the Korean people and turned to accelerate the expansion of armaments did it rise again. Therefore, the figure for 1951 reached twice that of 1929. During the same period, the industrial production of the United Kingdom only increased by 60 percent, while in other capitalist countries in Western Europe, industrial production still stagnated around the level of 1929." As for the industrial production of the people's democratic countries, it has also increased several times in a very short period, and the upward situation is similar to that of the Soviet Union. This is a clear contrast between the economic development of countries in the two camps in the world. The implementation of the new Soviet five-year plan will increase industrial output by about 70 percent. How can this not make the people of the world sing praises for the superiority of the Soviet socialist system once again!

III. Further Improvement of the Happy Life of the Soviet People

Due to the achievements of the Soviet Union's successive economic plans, the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people have been continuously improved. The national income of the Soviet Union was only 25 billion rubles at the beginning of the first five-year plan, but it increased to 45.1 billion rubles when the plan was completed in 1932. When the second five-year plan was completed in 1937, it increased to 96.3 billion rubles. In 1940, the third year of the third five-year plan, it had risen to 128.3 billion rubles. As a result of the implementation of the fourth five-year plan, it increased to more than 210 billion rubles. Such a rapid rise in the national income of the Soviet Union indicates the rise in the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people. During this period, the Soviet government also implemented the policy of reducing prices many times, so the improvement of the people's material living standards actually exceeded the degree indicated by these figures. According to current statistics, three-quarters of these national incomes are used to meet the individual material and cultural needs of workers, and about one-quarter is used by the state, collective farms and cooperatives to expand socialist production and meet other national and social needs. Not only that, but the true freedom, democracy and friendship enjoyed by the Soviet people in politics are also something that the working people in capitalist countries cannot enjoy. As for capitalist countries, taking the United States as an example, the national income of the United States only increased from more than 83 billion US dollars to more than 210 billion US dollars in the 20 years from 1929 to 1949. Even with these incomes, three-quarters of the working people in the United States only account for one-third of them, and they also have to suffer from heavy taxes, inflated currencies, etc., making it difficult for them to breathe. As for the situation encountered by its servant countries and colonial people, it is of course even worse, and there are unemployed and semi-unemployed people everywhere. Especially now, under the policy of continuing to prepare for aggressive wars by American and British imperialism, the disasters they suffer are getting deeper and deeper. As a result of the implementation of the new Soviet five-year plan, it is expected to increase national income by at least 60 percent. How can the people under imperialist rule not admire and praise the happy life of the Soviet people when they see this situation! The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow, so how can the people of our people's democratic countries not be happy and sing praises when they hear this news!

IV. The Unparalleled Strength of the Peace and Democracy Camp

The Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism, and the socialist countries established under the leadership of the Communist Party, have consistently advocated and implemented a policy of peace, opposed war, and opposed war propaganda. This is a well-known fact. Because the working people firmly believe that relying on their omnipotent hands, they can create abundant means of living and do not need to exploit others, so they do not need to invade others. They need lasting peace, and only in an environment of lasting peace can they create wealth and ensure a happy life to their heart's content. The liberated working people are not afraid of war, and resolutely support just revolutionary wars. The construction of heavy industry they are carrying out is to support anti-aggression wars. In his concluding report on the first five-year plan, Stalin taught us: "The basic link of the five-year plan is heavy industry and its core, namely the machine-building industry. Because only heavy industry can transform and revitalize the entire industry, transportation and agriculture." Otherwise, "Then we would have no tractor manufacturing industry, no automobile manufacturing industry, we would not have much serious ferrous metal smelting industry, we would not have metal to manufacture machines, and as a result, we would be unarmed in the face of the encirclement of capitalist countries armed with modern technology. Then, we would have no way to supply agriculture with tractors and various agricultural machines, and as a result, we would end up with no food. Then, we would have no way to defeat the domestic capitalists, and as a result, we would greatly increase the chances of capitalist restoration. Then, we would not be able to have all kinds of new defense weapons, and the independent status of our country would not be maintained, and our country would become the target of foreign enemies." How simple and clear this is! Therefore, we can know that the achievements of the Soviet Union's peaceful construction and the strengthening of its national defense forces are unified and inseparable. Peaceful construction is of course in the interests of the people, and strengthening national defense and defending the motherland are also in the interests of the people. The war economy of capitalist countries serves a few monopoly capitalists. It violates the will of the broad masses of the people and is in irreconcilable opposition to peaceful construction. The peace and democracy camp is very strong, and the imperialists' war conspiracies are bound to backfire:

First, the people of socialist and people's democratic countries are united, because their personal interests are consistent with the interests of the motherland. They deeply know that under the illumination of Marxism-Leninism, the future of their motherland is bright and splendid, and the future of their individuals is also bright and splendid. Therefore, the hearts of hundreds of millions of people are united as strong as steel, and they are all fighting for this bright and splendid future. The peace policy of the entire peace and democracy camp countries, headed by the Soviet Union, not only unites its own people, but is also uniting all peace-loving people in the world to fight together. Isn't the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference recently held in Beijing a clear proof? This is an important source for enhancing the national defense strength of socialist countries. The situation in capitalist countries is completely opposite. Their ruling classes plunder and annex each other for personal gain. The Wall Street bosses often quarrel endlessly over conflicting interests, and the ruling classes of France and Britain also have ulterior motives with the United States. Today, the domestic and foreign markets of Britain and France have been secretly squeezed out by the United States under the guise of "US aid" and the lies of "preventing communism". The flames of resistance against slavery and persecution among the American people and the people of American colonies are burning everywhere, and the wave of strikes is also constantly occurring and expanding, and the enthusiastic development of the peace movement and the spread of the liberation war have all given their rulers serious blows. The imperialist countries are weakening day by day in such a situation of overlapping contradictions, relying solely on lies and barbaric means to maintain their dilapidated situation. The contradictions will not be resolved until they bury themselves in the tomb.

Second, the socialist economic system is to meet the ever-increasing material and cultural needs of the working people. These requirements are always ahead of production. In peacetime, not only must the production of the means of production be continuously expanded, but also the production of the means of subsistence must be continuously expanded, so there cannot be a phenomenon of overproduction. When they are engaged in peaceful construction, they never forget the encirclement of imperialism; when they encounter imperialist aggression, they will unanimously and quickly transfer the national economy to the war track. This has been severely tested during the Soviet Patriotic War and after her victory over the German and Japanese fascist bandits. However, capitalist production, which aims at seizing the highest profits, is absolutely impossible to do this. Capitalist production is always disjointed in peacetime, with imbalances in supply and demand, sometimes there is too much production of one type of commodity, and sometimes there is insufficient production of another type of commodity, and capital and labor are constantly in turmoil, making the entire economy unable to find a way out in the cycle of prosperity, crisis, stagnation, and recovery. There is often unemployment of workers and idle capital. After the economic crisis strikes, the number of unemployed workers and idle capital will expand several times or even dozens of times, and the waste of human and material resources is extremely large. As imperialism has developed in recent decades, it has only relied on the war economy to ensure its maximum capital profits, and it has been destroying the peaceful economy everywhere. This not only wastes human and material resources, but also destroys human civilization. The dying struggle of capitalism poses a serious threat to world peace. We can only unite around the Soviet Union, raise the banner of upholding and consolidating world lasting peace, and wage a tenacious struggle. World peace can be defended. Striving to promote peaceful construction is a strong guarantee for defending peace.

    全世界人民为苏联实施新五年计划而歌颂
    马寅初
    自苏联“真理报”八月二十日发表苏联共产党第十九次代表大会关于苏联第五个五年计划指示草案这一具有世界意义的伟大文件以后，全世界劳动人民和爱好和平的人民，没有不欢欣鼓舞的，大家一致歌颂苏维埃社会主义制度再一次表现的优越性，歌颂苏联人民的幸福生活，歌颂和平民主阵营力量的无比壮大，及其对世界和平事业的伟大贡献。
    一、苏联新五年计划的基本任务
    这个五年计划的要点，确定五年期间在工业方面将生产水平提高约百分之七十。其中重要工业产品的产量和一九五○年相较：铣铁增加百分之七十六，钢增加百分之六十二，煤增加百分之四十三，石油增加百分之八十五，电力增加百分之八十。各部门的劳动生产率也将大大提高。在农业方面，谷物总收获量增加百分之四十到五十，原棉增加百分之五十五到六十五，其他如亚麻纤维、甜菜、马铃薯，向日葵、葡萄、烟草、上等绿茶等的增加，从百分之四十到百分之七十五不等。各种饲料产量的增加自百分之八十到四倍不等，并提高每公顷的收获量。以工农业产量的增加作为基础，在五年内，也要把国营和合作社零售贸易增加将近百分之七十。水陆空各种运输工具和能力也有相应的增加。工业农业和运输事业中的费力工作均向机械化和自动化的方向迈进。在社会主义生产的稳步增加和社会劳动生产率提高的基础上，将进一步提高人民的物质福利、公共卫生事业和文化水平。
    二、苏维埃社会主义制度再一次表现的优越性
    我们都知道，苏联自十月革命胜利后就在地球六分之一的面积上，建立起史无前例的社会主义国家。这个国家一个胜利接着一个胜利地前进，战胜了国内外反动派的阴谋进攻，改变了帝俄时代所遗留下的残破局面。一个一个的五年计划，都提前超额完成。在第二次世界大战摧毁了德国法西斯强盗的疯狂进攻之后，到第四个五年计划，不仅很快恢复了战争的创伤，工业产量并超过一九四○年水平的百分之七十三，现在第五个五年计划提到历史行程上又将二年了，它的胜利的必然性是毫无疑义的。苏联人民在这三十余年间的斗争中，不仅巩固了苏维埃社会主义制度，且给世界人民的解放斗争开辟了无限宽广的道路。这主要的关键在那里？就是苏联人民在列宁、斯大林党的英明卓越的领导下进行了英勇艰苦的斗争，掌握了政权，占有了生产工具，使全国经济才有可能依照一定的计划平衡发展，使全国的人力和物力得到最合理和最有效的使用，使客观存在的社会主义的经济法则能够在劳动人民自觉的基础上运用自如。这是资本主义经济体系国家所不可能有的事情。马林科夫在联共（布）第十九次代表大会上的报告说：“苏联在一九五一年的工业产量为一九二九年的百分之一千二百六十六，在这个时期差不多增为一九二九年的十三倍。苏联工业在战后时期正如战前一样，在发展和平生产的基础上不断地向上发展。……美国的工业生产在一九二九年到一九三九年这一时期中停滞不前，以后才有了进展，但是，这只是由于第二次世界大战期间军事生产量激增而引起的；后来大大下降，只是由于美国对朝鲜人民发动了战争转而加速扩张军备之后才重新上升，因此，一九五一年的数字到达了一九二九年的两倍。在同一时期内，英国的工业生产量只增加了百分之六十，而在西欧其他几个资本主义国家内，工业生产量仍然停滞在一九二九年的水平上下。”至于人民民主国家的工业生产量，在很短期间也都有几倍的增加，上升情况和苏联相似。这是世界两个阵营国家经济发展明显对比的事实。苏联新五年计划的实现，工业产量又将有约百分之七十的提高。这怎么不使全世界人民对苏维埃社会主义制度再一次表现的优越性而歌颂呢！
    三、苏联人民进一步提高的幸福生活
    由于苏联历届经济计划的成就，苏联人民的物质和文化生活水平不断提高。苏联的国民收入在第一个五年计划开始时仅有二百五十亿卢布，到一九三二年这个计划完成时，就增加到四百五十一亿卢布。一九三七年第二个五年计划完成时，又增加到九百六十三亿卢布。一九四○年是第三个五年计划的第三年度，已升到一千二百八十三亿卢布。第四个五年计划实施结果，又增加到二千一百余亿卢布。苏联国民收入这样迅速上升，就表示着苏联人民物质和文化生活水平的上升。在这期间，苏联政府又多次推行减低物价政策，因此人民物质生活水平的提高，实质上尚超过这些数字所表示的程度。据目前统计，这些国民收入中，有四分之三是用来满足劳动者个人的物质和文化需要，约四分之一由国家、集体农庄和合作社用来扩大社会主义生产，并满足其他全国的和社会的需要。不仅如此，苏联人民在政治上所享受的真正自由民主和友爱，更不是资本主义国家的劳动人民所能够享受得到的。至于资本主义国家，以美国为例，美国国民收入自一九二九年到一九四九年二十年间，仅从八百三十余亿美元增加到二千一百余亿美元。就是这些收入，美国四分之三的劳动人民，也只占着其中的三分之一，而且他们还要受着繁重的课税、膨胀的通货等等的压榨，透不过气来。至于它的仆从国家和殖民地人民所遭遇的情况，当然更要恶劣，半失业和失业的人民触目皆是。特别是现在在美英等帝国主义继续准备侵略战争的政策下，他们所遭受的灾难愈来愈深。苏联新五年计划实施的结果，预期至少可以增加国民收入百分之六十。帝国主义统治下的人民，看到这种情形，怎么会不欣羡和歌颂苏联人民的幸福生活呢！苏联的今天也就是我们的明天，所以我们人民民主国家的人民听到了这个消息，又怎么会不欢欣歌颂呢！
    四、和平民主阵营力量的无比壮大
    用马克思列宁主义武装起来的共产党，和由共产党领导建立起来的社会主义国家，一贯地主张和实行和平政策，反对战争，并反对战争的宣传，这是尽人皆知的事实。因为劳动人民深信依靠自己万能的手，就能创造丰富的生活资料，不需要剥削别人，故不需要侵略别人。他们需要持久和平，只有在持久和平的环境下，才能够称心地创造财富，确保幸福的生活。解放了的劳动人民也不害怕战争，并且坚决拥护正义的革命战争。他们所进行的重工业的建设，就是为了支持反侵略战争的。斯大林在第一个五年计划的总结报告中教导我们说：“五年计划底基本环节，就是重工业和它的核心，即机器制造业。因为只有重工业，才能把全部工业，运输业以及农业都改造过来，振兴起来。”要不然，“那时我们就会没有拖拉机制造业，也没有汽车制造业，就会没有多少严重的黑金属冶炼业，就会没有金属来制造机器，结果也就会在拥有新式技术武装的资本主义国家包围面前陷于手无寸铁的状况。那时，我们就会没有可能用拖拉机和各种农业机器来供给农业，结果也就会落得没有粮食。那时，我们就会无法战胜国内资本主义分子，结果也就会大大增加资本主义复辟的机会。那时，我们就会不能有一切新式国防武器，而使我国底国家独立地位不能维持下去，使我国变成外敌用武的对象。”这是说得多么的简单明了呵！因此，我们可以知道，苏联的和平建设的成就和国防力量的增强是统一而不可分的。和平建设固然符合人民利益，加强国防，保卫祖国，也是符合人民利益的。资本主义国家的备战经济，是为少数垄断资本家服务的，它违反广大人民的意志，与和平建设处于不可调和的对立地位。和平民主阵营是很强大的，帝国主义的战争阴谋，必然是玩火自焚：
    第一，社会主义和各人民民主国家的人民是团结
    一致的，原因是他们个人的利益和祖国的利益是一致的。他们深深知道他们的祖国在马克思列宁主义照耀下，前途是光辉灿烂的，他们个人的前途也是光辉灿烂的。因此，亿万人的心团结得像钢铁一般坚强，都为了争取这一光辉灿烂的前途而斗争。以苏联为首的整个和平民主阵营国家的和平政策，不仅团结了自己的人民，也正在团结全世界一切爱好和平的人民共同斗争。最近在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议不是一个明证吗？这是社会主义国家的国防力量增强的重要源泉。资本主义国家的情形就完全相反，他们的统治阶级各人为着私利，而互相掠夺兼并。华尔街老板们经常为相互利害冲突而争吵不休，法国英国的统治阶级和美国的统治阶级也是同床异梦。今天英法各国的国内外市场，已经在“美援”的掩饰下，在“防范共产主义”的谎言下，偷偷地被美国排挤出去了。美国人民和美国殖民地人民反抗奴役和迫害的怒火到处在燃烧，罢工怒潮也在不断发生和扩大，和平运动的热烈展开，解放战争的蔓延，处处都给了他们统治者以严重的打击。帝国主义国家在这样矛盾重重，专靠谎言和野蛮手段来维持的残破局面，力量一天天地在削弱，非把自己葬送到坟墓去，矛盾是不会解决的。
    第二，社会主义的经济体系，是为了满足劳动人民不断高涨的物质和文化生活的要求的。这种要求总是经常走在生产的前头，在和平的时候，不仅要不断扩大生产资料的生产，也在不断扩大生活资料的生产，因此不可能有生产过剩的现象。他们在和平建设的时候，从没有忘记帝国主义的包围；当遭遇着帝国主义侵犯的时候，他们就万众一心地把全国经济迅速地转移到战争轨道上来。战争一经胜利结束，他们又能迅速地恢复和平建设。这在苏联卫国战争期间和她战胜德日法西斯强盗之后，已经经过严重的考验了。但在以掠取最高利润为目的的资本主义生产，那是绝对做不到的。资本主义的生产，在平时已经处处脱节，供求失调，时而甲种商品生产过多，时而乙种商品生产不足，资本和劳动不断地在动荡，使整个经济在繁荣、危机、停滞、复兴轮回圈中找不到出路。经常地存在着工人失业和资本闲置的现象。经济危机来袭后，失业工人和闲置资本还要扩大数倍以至十数倍，浪费人力和物力是极大的。帝国主义发展到最近数十年间，只靠战争经济来保证它的最大限度的资本利润，到处破坏着和平经济，这不仅浪费人力物力，而且毁灭人类的文明。资本主义的垂死挣扎，使世界和平遭到严重的威胁。我们只有团结在苏联的周围，高举起拥护和巩固世界持久和平的旗帜，作顽强的斗争，世界的和平是可以保卫得住的。努力推进和平建设，是保卫和平的有力保证。
