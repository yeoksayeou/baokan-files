    The basic construction projects in the Northwest region this year have generally commenced. Workers at all construction sites are working intensely to strive to complete this year's plan. Among the 34 basic construction units of state-owned industries in the region, 27 have started construction; among the 32 basic construction units of local state-owned industries, 28 have started construction; all 46 water conservancy construction units and 7 transportation line construction projects have also commenced.
    The scale and scope of basic construction in the Northwest region this year greatly exceeds that of previous years, with total investment more than double that of last year. Among them, new construction projects account for 42.94 percent, and reconstruction projects account for 57.06 percent.
    In order to do a good job in basic construction, all basic construction units, on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, have carried out a series of rectifications. All units first reviewed and summarized the work experience of basic construction in 1951, strengthened leadership, adjusted institutions, and initially established some necessary management systems. As a result, all basic construction units have taken on a new look. Based on the unprecedented improvement of the political consciousness of the broad masses of workers and the development of production competition, basic construction costs have been greatly reduced. For example, the actual cost of basic construction in the state-owned petroleum industry in the first half of this year was 15.6 percent lower than the original plan; the electricity industry was 4.08 percent lower; and the textile industry was 4.43 percent lower.
    In the patriotic production competition, all basic construction units generally attached importance to promoting advanced experiences. The basic construction units of the petroleum industry department widely implemented the responsibility system: the "Four-Check System" (checking blueprints, checking materials, checking construction, and checking material quotas) of the Qiu Changfa Group, the "Three-Special System" (special person, special task, special responsibility) of the Bu Xuezhi Group, and the advanced experience of the Shier Well Model Drilling Team were all welcomed by the broad masses of workers. The textile department promoted the parallel assembly line operation method in installation engineering. The Su Changyou bricklaying method and the Xie Wanfu carpentry assembly line operation method have been heavily promoted in the construction engineering department. While promoting advanced experiences, workers launched a movement to find shortcuts and make rationalization proposals, and inventions and creations from the masses continued to emerge. The new-style tools created and improved by the workers of the Northwest Construction Engineering Company have been widely reproduced and promoted; Li Yulin's stuck-drill solution method at the Yumen Oil Mine, etc., have played a certain role in improving efficiency and ensuring quality. Now, the actual labor efficiency of construction projects has generally broken the original quotas. Among them, bricklaying has increased by 14.28 percent, concrete engineering has increased by 25 percent, and drilling efficiency has also increased significantly.
    This year's basic construction tasks are heavy. Coupled with the impact of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, in the first half of this year, except for water conservancy construction investment and loan projects which each completed more than 50 percent of the annual plan, the basic construction of state-owned and local state-owned industries only completed 26.91 percent of the annual plan, and the construction of transportation department lines only completed 12.77 percent of the annual plan. In order to strive to complete this year's basic construction tasks according to the plan, the Northwest Financial and Economic Committee has decided to make doing a good job in basic construction the central work of the second half of this year. The Northwest Financial and Economic Committee has instructed all departments to quickly replenish cadres, improve institutions, and earnestly focus leadership on basic construction. The Northwest Financial and Economic Committee also instructed all units to strengthen inspection work in basic construction, strictly implement basic construction procedures, and implement the contract system; before design, they must fully conduct preparatory work such as investigation, research, and exploration, so as to achieve meticulous design and correct construction, and avoid rework and waste. In the material supply department, attention should be paid to ensuring supply in order to correct the currently serious phenomenon of work stoppages waiting for materials. At the same time, in order to welcome a large-scale upsurge of economic construction, leaders at all levels and basic construction cadres are required to launch an enthusiastic movement to study basic construction, criticize manifestations of not paying attention to basic construction work and not daring to take bold responsibility, promote a proactive, responsible, and hardworking style of studying problems, and constantly summarize basic construction experiences, improve work, and strive to ensure project progress and quality and complete this year's basic construction tasks.

    西北财政经济委员会责成各单位
    争取完成今年基本建设任务
    西北区今年的基本建设工程，目前已普遍施工。各工地职工正为争取完成本年度计划而紧张工作。在全区国营工业三十四个基本建设单位中，二十七个单位已开工；地方国营工业三十二个基本建设单位中，二十八个单位已开工；四十六个水利建设单位及七条交通线路建设工程则已全部开工。
    今年西北区基本建设的规模和范围，大大超过往年，投资总额较去年增加一倍以上。其中新建工程占百分之四十二点九四，改建工程占百分之五十七点零六。
    为了做好基本建设工作，各基本建设单位，在“三反”“五反”运动胜利的基础上，曾经进行了一系列的整顿。各单位首先检查和总结了一九五一年基本建设的工作经验，加强了领导，调整了机构，并初步建立了一些必要的管理制度。因此，各基本建设单位，都出现了新的面貌。在广大职工政治觉悟空前提高与开展生产竞赛运动基础上，基本建设费用已大大减少。例如：今年上半年国营石油工业基本建设实际费用，比原计划减低百分之十五点六；电业减低百分之四点零八；纺织减低百分之四点四三。
    各基本建设单位，在爱国生产竞赛中，普遍重视了推广先进经验。石油工业部门基本建设单位，广泛推行了责任制：邱长发小组的四查制（查蓝图、查材料、查施工、查定料），卜学智小组三专制
    （专人、专事、专责）和石二井模范钻井队的先进经验，均受到广大职工的欢迎。纺织部门在安装工程中，推行了平行流水作业法。苏长有砌砖法和谢万福木工流水作业法，已在建筑工程部门重点推行。在推广先进经验的同时，职工们掀起了找窍门和合理化建议运动，群众中的发明创造不断涌现。西北建筑工程公司工人们创造和改进的新式工具已普遍翻制推广；玉门油矿工人李玉林的解卡钻法等，对提高效率、保证质量起了一定的作用。现在建筑工程实际工率，一般都打破了原有定额。其中砌砖提高了百分之十四点二八，混凝土工程提高了百分之二十五，钻井效率也提高了很多。
    今年基本建设任务重大，加上“三反”“五反”运动的影响，今年上半年度，除水利建设投资和贷款工程各完成全年计划百分之五十以上，国营及地方国营工业的基本建设，仅完成全年计划百分之二十六点九一，交通部门线路建设则仅完成全年计划百分之十二点七七。为了争取按照计划完成今年基本建设的任务，西北财政经济委员会已决定将做好基本建设工作，作为今年下半年度的中心工作。西北财政经济委员会已责成各部迅速充实干部，健全机构，切实把领导重点放在基本建设方面。西北财政经济委员会并指示各单位，在基本建设工作中必须加强检查工作，严格执行基本建设程序，贯彻合同制；在设计以前，必须充分地进行调查、研究、勘察等准备工作，做到周密设计和正确施工，避免返工浪费。在物资供应部门，应注意切实保证供应，以纠正目前严重存在的停工待料现象。同时，为了迎接大规模经济建设高潮，要求各级领导和基本建设干部，展开一个热烈学习基本建设的运动，批判不重视基本建设工作和不敢大胆负责的表现，发扬积极负责、努力钻研问题的作风，随时总结基本建设经验，改进工作，为保证工程进度和质量，争取完成今年基本建设任务而努力。
