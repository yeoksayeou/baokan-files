    Chairman, fellow representatives of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference:

    I am here to give a supplementary report on the Japanese issue.

    The rise and expansion of Japanese militarism has been a source of deep concern for Australia for many years. Japan's invasion of China in 1930 caused great indignation and anxiety. After Japan's attacks on China in 1931 and 1937, Australia launched various movements to support the Chinese people. In 1937, Japanese militarists invaded Hebei Province. In 1938, the Australian government sold pig iron to the Japanese warlords, and dockworkers in Canberra Port (in New South Wales, Australia) refused to load this war material onto ships. The conservative government then passed a repressive decree, the so-called "Dog Collar Act," to force the loading of these goods. This was one of the most important struggles in the history of the Australian labor movement. Sir Isaac Isaacs, a famous Australian jurist and former Governor-General, summarized this struggle in these words:

    "People refused to ship pig iron for the sole reason that they conscientiously believed that by doing so, they would become accomplices in helping Japan invade and bomb innocent residents. The government intervened and forced them to ship the pig iron."

    Later, Australian workers refused to ship wool, tin, lead, and other strategic materials to Japan. The leader of this struggle to maintain peace, Jim Healy, the National Secretary of the Australian Waterside Workers' Federation, should have been with us today. He is one of the twenty-three Australian delegates who were denied passports and could not attend this conference. The government that denied them passports is the same government that assisted in arming the Japanese warlords from 1937 until Japan attacked Australia in 1941.

    In 1941, when the Japanese warlords launched a war to conquer the entire Asia-Pacific region, the Australian people engaged in a hard struggle to defend their homeland. Japanese naval and air forces bombed a seaport in northernmost Australia, and Japanese troops were only a few miles away from invading the Australian mainland. Tens of thousands of Australians became prisoners of the Japanese army and suffered greatly. The threat of invasion was not lifted until 1944 by the armies of Australia, the United States, and other countries.

    Japan's defeat and disarmament, and the provisions in the Japanese Constitution renouncing war, led many to believe that Japanese militarism had been eliminated forever. The Potsdam Agreement declared that Japan's power to wage war should be destroyed. The "Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan," jointly adopted by the representatives of the eleven countries that resisted Japanese aggression, stipulated that its primary objectives were:

    "To complete the task of materially and spiritually disarming Japan. This includes the complete disarmament; reorganization of the economy to deprive Japan of the power to wage war; elimination of the influence of militarism; strict trial of war criminals; and provision for a period of strict control."

    At the end of the war, the Australian people believed that this policy would be implemented and would result in a peaceful, democratic, and demilitarized Japan. According to the Allied agreement, the responsibility for controlling Japan belonged to the "Four-Power Control Committee" composed of representatives from China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the British Commonwealth. Recognizing that Australia had a special stake in the Japanese issue, an Australian—Mr. McMahon Ball—was considered the representative of the British Commonwealth. Later, the Control Committee was dominated by the United States, and the Australian government did not support his view that there should be genuine four-power joint control of post-war Japan, so Mr. Ball resigned in anger.

    His book "Japan, Enemy or Ally?" clearly pointed out to the Australian people that Japan was completely under American rule; war criminals were treated leniently, and even went unpunished; Japan had not achieved genuine democratization, and the roots of Japanese militarism remained intact.

    In 1951, Dulles visited Australia. His purpose in visiting was clearly to make the Australian government sign the separate "Treaty of Peace with Japan" he drafted, a treaty that betrayed the security and future of the Australian people.

    When the terms of the treaty were announced, they immediately aroused widespread opposition in Australia. The vast majority of Australians were shocked to see the revival of pre-war Japanese militarism. This separate treaty by the U.S. government betrayed the Potsdam Agreement and the basic post-surrender policy for Japan.

    Opposition to this treaty came not only from people in various peace councils, but also from all walks of life, including some members of the government party, such as former Prime Minister Hughes, who said that rearming Japan was an act of "treason." Leaders and members of veterans' organizations opposed the treaty; former prisoners of war captured by the Japanese army and relatives of prisoners of war who died in concentration camps felt great grief. Many social celebrities participated in this mass opposition movement, including Archbishop Mowll of the Anglican Church of Sydney, General Gordon Bennett, and Mr. Clive Evatt, the Attorney General of New South Wales.

    The business community also strongly opposed it. Under the terms of the treaty, Australia was obliged to grant Japan "most-favored-nation treatment" in Japanese-Australian trade relations. This caused panic and hostility among Australian manufacturers, especially textile and light industry manufacturers. This threat became even more apparent when it was announced that thirty-two ships were licensed to operate on the Japan-Australia route. A spokesperson for the Associated Chambers of Commerce said: "Australia has opened its doors to Japanese merchants to attack its markets… Any indulgence by the Australian government towards this Japanese threat will inevitably mean the ruin of many Australian manufacturers."

    As a result of the struggle against this treaty, the "Committee Against the Rearmament of Japan" was established. The "Committee Against the Rearmament of Japan" was supported by Australian workers, business people, intellectuals, veterans, more than two hundred clergymen of different denominations, and people from all walks of life. In a short period of time, the committee collected one hundred thousand signatures for a petition against Japanese remilitarization and trade terms in the Japanese treaty. This petition has been submitted to Parliament by approximately three hundred representatives from all over Australia.

    Although the treaty was approved by the government, it was opposed by the opposition Labor Party in Parliament. The Labor Party had won 49 percent of the vote in the previous election. Even some members of the government party attacked the treaty in Parliament.

    These facts clearly illustrate the attitude of the vast majority of the Australian people towards Japan and the continued occupation of Japan by American troops. The movement against ratifying the separate treaty has greatly promoted the development of the peace movement in Australia.

    This treaty was signed in a puppet show held at the San Francisco Opera House last December. The governments of the Soviet Union, People's China, India, and Burma did not sign, and the population of these countries accounts for half of the world's population. Although the Australian government signed it, the Australian people did not.

    Our government and its powerful propaganda machine portray this separate treaty as a measure to ensure Australia's security. The people know that this statement is completely false; they deeply know that a rearmed Japan is a threat to Australia's security and the peace of the Asia-Pacific region.

    Since then, there has been much evidence of the revival of Japan's expansionist ambitions. Japanese war criminals have been released and are rebuilding their forces. The remarks of Japanese politicians quoted in Australian newspapers indicate that Japanese militarism intends to advance south again. The rich island of New Guinea, north of Australia, is once again the target of these expansionists' ambitions. The Japanese government has requested the Australian government to repatriate more than two hundred Japanese war criminals, some of whom are serving life sentences for crimes against the Australian people. But according to reliable reports on September 14, 1952, the Australian government "will almost certainly agree to this request." There have also been reports that Japan is again ambitious to regain Australia's iron ore and other mineral resources.

    The Australian government, headed by Mr. Menzies, is assisting in the revival of Japanese militarism and expansionism, and is betraying Australia's security in the same way as it condoned Japan's invasion of China in 1930.

    The Australian people do not want to be victims of a revived Japanese militarism, nor do they want to be its allies in wars of aggression in Asia and the Pacific. Both paths will lead to the destruction of our country and people.

    The U.S. government's war plans have caused widespread panic. Not only has Japan been rearmed, but a series of military bases have been established from Japan to Australia, from the Philippine Islands to the Polynesian Islands. All these measures are clearly aimed at opposing People's China and other Asian countries, threatening the entire Asia-Pacific region with war.

    The same people who are forcing the Japanese people to accept the remilitarization of Japan and agree to the continued occupation of Japan by foreign troops have dragged the people of Australia and New Zealand into another war treaty—the ANZUS Treaty. According to this treaty, which was recently established in Honolulu, Australia and New Zealand must participate in any war that the U.S. government intends to launch in the Asia-Pacific region. Sir Spender, the Australian ambassador to Washington and a shareholder in several rubber companies in Malaya, once revealed that the ANZUS Treaty stipulates that Australia and New Zealand will supply one million personnel in wartime—while the total population of the two countries is only ten million. Although Spender quickly retracted his statement, the people of Australia and New Zealand clearly understand what the ANZUS Treaty means for them.

    The separate Treaty of Peace with Japan, the ANZUS Treaty, and the U.S.-Philippines agreement are three components of the war currently being planned in the Pacific. And the cornerstone of this plan is Japan.

    Therefore, the Japanese people bear a heavy responsibility in the struggle against the revival of Japanese militarism. The Australian people were greatly comforted to hear of their uprisings against rearmament and resistance to American rule over their country, especially their demonstrations around May 1, 1952. We want to know more about the Japanese people's struggle for peace; if we can have regular contact with the Japanese peace movement, it will strengthen our Australian struggle for peace. Our delegation believes that this conference will enable us to establish such connections.

    Because the Australian government has obeyed the U.S. government's war plans in the Pacific, our people are faced with two paths: either to become allies of Japanese militarism, or to become its victims. Both will destroy us. The only solution is for our people to fight alongside the people of China, Japan, and other Asian and Pacific countries against the war that is being plotted.

    Militarized Japan is very important to these war plans. The victory of the struggle to achieve an independent, democratic, and peace-loving Japan will be a severe setback to the U.S. government's plans to wage war against People's China and other Asian people who have truly achieved independence.

    The Australian delegation is pleased to welcome the representatives of the peace-loving Japanese people at this conference. They are our friends and allies in the struggle for peace in Asia and the Pacific; our common enemies are Japanese militarists and the U.S. government that supports Japanese militarism. We are very pleased that the Japanese representatives were able to overcome various obstacles from the U.S. government to come here to participate in the conference; the U.S. government correctly recognizes that this conference is a blow to its war conspiracy.

    We propose that the resolution of the conference should include a call to the people of Asia and the Pacific to support the Japanese people's struggle against the remilitarization of Japan and against turning Japan into an armed base for invading other people's countries.

### 澳大利亚代表团团长詹姆斯  关于日本问题的补充报告

    澳大利亚代表团团长詹姆斯
    关于日本问题的补充报告
    主席先生，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各位代表们：
    我现在来作关于日本问题的补充报告。
    日本军国主义的兴起和扩张是澳大利亚多年来深重忧虑的根源。一九三○年日本侵略中国的行动引起了极大的愤慨和焦虑。一九三一年和一九三七年日本进攻中国之后，澳大利亚展开了各种运动支持中国人民。一九三七年日本军国主义者进犯河北省。一九三八年，澳洲政府将铣铁卖给日本军阀，当时堪培拉港（在澳大利亚新威尔斯）的码头工人拒绝把这项战争物资装载上船。于是保守政府通过一项镇压法令即所谓“狗颈圈法”来强迫装载这种货物。这是澳大利亚工人运动史上最重要的一次斗争。关于这次斗争澳大利亚著名的法学家和前总督艾萨克·艾萨克斯爵士曾综括起来说了这样几句话：
    “人们拒绝装运铣铁，唯一的原因就是，他们从良心上认为，如果这样做，他们就成为帮助日本侵略，轰炸善良居民的帮凶。政府却出来干预，强迫他们装运铣铁。”
    后来澳大利亚工人拒绝替日本装运羊毛、锡、铅以及其它战略物资。领导这一次维护和平的斗争的领导人今天本应当和我们在一起的。他就是澳大利亚码头工人联合会全国书记吉穆·赫利，也就是被拒绝发给护照，不能出席这次会议的二十三位澳大利亚代表之一。拒绝发给他们护照的那个政府正是从一九三七年直到一九四一年日本进攻澳大利亚的时候始终协助武装日本军阀的那种政府。
    一九四一年日本军阀发动征服整个亚洲和太平洋区域的战争，这时澳大利亚人民投入了保卫祖国的坚苦斗争。日本的海空军轰击澳大利亚最北部的一个海港，日军距离侵入澳大利亚本土不过数英里。成千成万的澳大利亚人民成为日军俘虏，受尽痛苦。侵略的威胁一直到一九四四年才被澳大利亚、美国和其他国家的军队所解除。
    日本的战败与被解除武装，和日本宪法中申明放弃战争的规定，使得一般人相信日本军国主义是永远被消灭了。波茨坦的协定宣称：日本制造战争的力量应予毁灭。抵抗日本侵略的十一国代表所共同通过的“对投降后的日本的基本政策”规定其首要目的为：
    “完成日本物质及精神上解除武装之任务。其方法包括全部解除军备；改组经济，以剥夺日本作战之力量；消灭军国主义之势力；严厉审判战犯；并规定一严格管制之时期。”
    大战结束时，澳大利亚人民相信这个政策会得到实现，并且会从而产生一个爱好和平的、民主的、肃清了军国主义的日本。根据盟国的协议，管制日本的责任属于由中国、苏联、美国和不列颠联邦的代表所组成的“四强管制委员会”。由于大家承认澳大利亚在日本问题上有特殊的利害关系，有一个澳大利亚人——麦克玛洪·鲍尔先生——被认为不列颠联邦的代表。后来管制委员会被美国所把持，同时澳大利亚政府又不支持他主张真正由四强共同管制战后日本的意见，鲍尔先生因此愤而辞职。
    他所著的“日本，敌人还是盟友？”这本书给澳大利亚人民明显地指出，日本完全是在美国统治之下；战犯受到宽大处理，甚且未受到惩罚；日本并没有得到真正的民主化，并且日本军国主义的根源还是原封不动。
    一九五一年，杜勒斯访问澳大利亚。他访问的目的很明显是要使澳大利亚的政府一定在他所起草的单独“对日和约”上签字，这个和约乃是出卖澳大利亚人民的安全与前途的一个条约。
    当和约的条文公布的时候，立即引起澳大利亚普遍反对的呼声。澳大利亚绝大多数人民看到战前的日本军国主义从此就要复活，大为震惊。美国政府的这一单独和约出卖了波茨坦协定和对投降后的日本的基本政策。
    反对这个条约的，不只是包括各和平理事会的人士，而且还包括各方面以至于政府党的一些党员，就如曾任首相的休斯，他说：重新武装日本是“叛国行为”。各退伍军人组织的领袖与会员反对这个条约；从前曾被日军俘虏的人员和死在集中营里的战俘的亲属都感到莫大的悲痛。参加这个群众反对运动的有许多社会名流，其中有悉尼圣公会茅尔大主教、戈登·伯纳将军，以及新南威尔斯的检察长克利夫·伊瓦特先生。
    工商界也加以强烈的反对。根据该条约的条款，澳大利亚被责成在日澳通商关系中给予日本以“最惠国待遇”。这引起了澳大利亚制造商，特别是纺织工业与轻工业制造商的恐慌和敌视。当宣布三十二艘船只被特许行驶日本澳大利亚航线时，这种威胁更为明显。商会联合会的发言人说：“澳大利亚洞开了大门，让日本商人进攻它的市场……澳大利亚政府对于日本这种威胁的任何纵容都必然意味着许多澳大利亚制造商的绝路。”
    反抗这个条约的斗争发展的结果，成立了“反对重新武装日本委员会”。“反对重新武装日本委员会”受到澳大利亚工人、工商界人士、知识分子、退伍军人、不同宗派的教士二百余人以及各界人士的支持。该委员会在短时期内便为反对日本重新军国主义化和对日条约中贸易条款的请愿书征集到十万个签名。这一请愿书已由全澳大利亚的约三百名代表提交给国会。
    该约虽然得到政府的批准，但是在议会中受到反对党工党的反对。工党曾在前一次的选举中获得百分之四十九的选票。甚至有些政府党的成员也在议会中攻击这个条约。
    这些事实清楚地说明了澳大利亚绝大多数人民对于日本和美国军队继续占领日本所抱的态度。这个反对批准单独条约的运动，使得澳大利亚的和平运动获得了极大的发展。
    这个条约在去年十二月在旧金山歌剧院举行的傀儡戏中签字。苏联、人民中国、印度和缅甸的政府没有签字，而这些国家的人口占世界人口的一半。虽然澳大利亚政府签了字，但是澳大利亚人民并没有签字。
    我国政府和它的有势力的宣传机关把这个单独条约描述为确保澳洲安全的一项措施。人民知道这种说法完全是撒谎；他们深深地知道一个重新武装起来的日本对于澳洲的安全和亚洲太平洋这区域的和平是一种威胁。
    从那以后，日本扩张主义野心的复活，有着许多证据。日本战犯获得了自由，并正在重新建立他们的部队。澳国报纸所引用的日本政治家的谈话表明日本军国主义企图重新向南推进。在澳大利亚北面的富庶的新几内亚岛又要成为这些扩张主义者的野心的目标。日本政府曾要求澳大利亚政府遣返二百以上的日本战犯，其中有些人，因蹂躏澳洲人民的罪行，正在执行无期徒刑。但据一九五二年九月十四日的可靠报道，澳大利亚政府“差不多一定会答应这一要求”。也有些报道说，日本又有野心要重新获得澳大利亚的铁矿和其他矿藏。
    以孟席斯先生为首的澳大利亚政府，既然协助日本军国主义和扩张主义的复活，它就像一九三○年纵容日本侵略中国的时候一样，出卖了澳大利亚的安全。
    澳大利亚人民既不愿做复活起来的日本军国主义的牺牲品，也不愿充当它在亚洲和太平洋进行侵略战争的同盟者。这两条道路都将使我们的国家和人民遭受毁灭。
    美国政府的战争计划已经引起了普遍的恐慌。目前不但日本已经重新被武装起来了，而且从日本到澳大利亚，从菲律宾群岛到玻里尼西亚群岛，建立了一连串的军事基地。所有这一切的措施显然是为了反对人民中国和其他亚洲的国家，使整个亚洲和太平洋区域受到战争的威胁。
    强迫日本人民接受使日本重新军国主义化，强迫日本人民同意外国军队继续占领日本的那一批人，又把澳大利亚和新西兰的人民拖进了另外一个战争条约——美、澳、新三国条约。按照最近在檀香山成立的这项条约，澳大利亚和新西兰必须参加美国政府意图在亚洲和太平洋区域发动的任何战争。澳大利亚驻华盛顿大使，马来亚几家橡胶公司的股东斯宾德爵士曾经透露过这样的消息：美、澳、新三国条约规定澳大利亚和新西兰在战时将供给一百万的人员——而两个国家总人口只有一千万人。斯宾德虽然赶紧取消了他的谈话，然而澳大利亚和新西兰的人民很清楚地认识到美、澳、新三国条约对于他们究竟是怎么一回事。
    单独对日和约，美、澳、新三国条约和美国与菲律宾的协定是目前正计划在太平洋发动的战争的三个组成部分。而这个计划的基石就是日本。
    因此，日本人民在反对日本军国主义复活的斗争中负有重大的责任。他们起来反对重新武装，反抗美国对他们国家的统治，特别是他们在一九五二年五月一日前后的示威，澳大利亚人民听到了都感到极大的快慰。我们想要更多了解日本人民争取和平斗争的情况；假使能与日本的和平运动有经常的联系，是能加强我们澳大利亚争取和平的斗争的。我们的代表团相信这次会议一定能使我们建立这样的联系。
    由于澳大利亚政府服从了美国政府在太平洋的战争计划，便使我们的人民面临着两条路：不是成为日本军国主义的同盟者，就是成为它的牺牲品。这两者都会使我们毁灭。唯一的解决办法就是，我们的人民与中国、日本及其他亚洲和太平洋国家的人民并肩为反对正在阴谋策划的战争而斗争。
    军国主义化的日本对于这些战争计划是很重要的。争取实现独立、民主、爱好和平的日本的斗争取得胜利，将使美国政府对人民中国及其他已经确实取得独立的亚洲人民发动战争的计划遭到惨重的挫折。
    澳大利亚代表团很愉快地在这个会议上欢迎爱好和平的日本人民的代表们。他们是我们在争取亚洲及太平洋区域和平的斗争中的朋友和同盟军；我们的共同敌人是日本的军国主义者和支持日本军国主义者的美国政府。我们非常高兴日本代表们能够突破了美国政府的种种阻挠，来到这里参加会议；美国政府正确地认识这个会议对于它的战争阴谋是一个打击。
    我们主张大会的决议案中应包括一项向亚洲及太平洋区域人民的号召，要求他们支持日本人民反对把日本重新军国主义化，反对把日本作为侵略他国人民的武装基地的斗争。
