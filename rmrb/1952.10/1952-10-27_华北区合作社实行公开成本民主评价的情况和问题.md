The North China General Cooperative circulated a notice to cooperative societies in all provinces and cities in the North China region in August, calling on everyone to resolutely promote this experience. During the campaign to increase production and practice economy, cooperative societies at all levels regarded open cost and democratic evaluation as an important method to realize democratic management and improve business operations. At the same time, they also regarded it as a movement to transform the thinking of cooperative staff. Therefore, within less than two months, this method has been widely promoted throughout the region, with the cooperative societies in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces developing more extensively and deeply.

After two months of practice, it has further proved the benefits of open cost and democratic evaluation.

I. It further overcomes capitalist management thinking and clarifies the business policy of cooperative societies of "facing the members and facing production." When cooperative societies at all levels implemented open cost and democratic evaluation, they universally examined capitalist management thinking, which made cooperative society cadres generally realize the seriousness of capitalist management thinking. The Taishanmiao Village Cooperative in Huojia County, Pingyuan Province, examined the past erroneous practice of "doing it if it is profitable for the members, and not doing it if it is not profitable": the cooperative society handed in 4,000 jin of ginned cotton to the Cotton and Cloth Company, and made an illegal profit of 1.7 million yuan from the upgrading alone; the purchase cost of DDT (pesticide) was 16,000 yuan per jin, but it was sold for 32,000 yuan. In the past, the Wuqi County Cooperative in Hebei Province purchased men's socks from the special district cooperative for 61,200 yuan per dozen, and resold them to the grassroots cooperative for 79,000 yuan per dozen, with a gross profit margin of 22.5 percent. The selling price of each flashlight in the Xiahe Village Cooperative in Quyang was 3,700 yuan higher than that of the local department store. After examining and criticizing capitalist management thinking and management methods, cooperative societies in various places have further clarified the management policy of "serving the members and serving production," and established the management style of "genuine goods at fair prices, good attitude, accurate scales and measures," which is very satisfactory to the broad masses of members. Facts have proved that whether cooperative societies at all levels can seriously disclose costs and conduct democratic evaluations depends on whether the cadres of the cooperative societies can be determined to eliminate capitalist management thinking, and whether capitalist management thinking has been eliminated.

II. It has enriched the content of democratic management, strengthened the relationship between higher-level cooperative societies and lower-level cooperative societies, between grassroots cooperative societies and members, and between cooperative societies and relevant departments, making members more trusting of cooperative societies. In the past, although various places also advocated "democratic management," most cooperative societies did very little. After open cost and democratic evaluation, many members reflected: "Asking us to participate in the evaluation, this is more like being the master." Some members also consciously examined their bad ideas of not caring about the cooperative society and wanting to take advantage of the cooperative society in the past. In the past, many grassroots cooperative societies in Quyang County, Hebei Province, suspected that the county cooperative's goods were expensive and were unwilling to purchase goods from it. However, since the county cooperative implemented open cost and democratic evaluation, all grassroots cooperative societies in the county have purchased goods from the county cooperative. After open cost and democratic evaluation, local party and government leading organs have attached more importance to the work of cooperative societies and strengthened their leadership and assistance to cooperative societies.

III. It has made commodity prices more reasonable, eliminated the phenomenon of commodity backlog, accelerated commodity turnover, expanded business, and relatively reduced commodity circulation costs. During the democratic evaluation of the Majiafen Cooperative in Huailai County, Chahar, the members felt that the purchase price of almonds was too high, and after discussion, it was appropriately lowered; the prices of eight commodities that were originally sold at lower prices were appropriately increased. The Dongting Village Cooperative in Ding County, Hebei Province, democratically evaluated the prices of nine major commodities, which were on average 5.9 percent lower than before, 3.7 percent lower than the retail price of state-owned trading companies, and 29.2 percent lower than the price of private merchants. After the cooperative society lowered the price of goods, the accumulated slow-moving goods were sold out, and the turnover increased sharply. Because the turnover expanded, the commodity circulation costs were relatively reduced. Therefore, although the gross profit margin decreased, the net profit margin increased instead. The average gross profit margin of the Dongjie United Village Cooperative in Ding County in the first and second quarters was 6.5 percent, which decreased to 5.3 percent after the open cost (in July). The commodity circulation cost decreased from 2.4 to 1.2 percent, and the net profit margin increased from 2.3 to 3.3 percent instead. The capital turnover rate was 3.2 in the first quarter, and reached 1.8 in July alone; the commodity turnover rate was 6.2 in the first quarter, and reached 3.7 in July alone.

These fully demonstrate the enormous role of open cost and democratic evaluation of cooperative societies.

At present, the main problems of open cost and democratic evaluation of cooperative societies in North China are that they are not in-depth and not balanced. The cooperative societies in Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shanxi provinces are doing better, while the provinces and cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Chahar, and Suiyuan are not yet widespread, and some areas have not yet penetrated into the grassroots cooperative societies and the masses of members. When cooperative societies in some areas implemented open cost and democratic evaluation, there were also deviations from a purely task-oriented view, perfunctory coping, and formalism. Some cooperative societies only disclose commodities with small profits, but not commodities with large profits; or only disclose the cost of slow-moving goods, but not the cost of fast-selling goods; some cooperative societies even retain hidden profits when disclosing costs, actually expanding the costs. Obviously, these are all wrong.

In order to do a better job in the open cost and democratic evaluation of cooperative societies, the following suggestions are put forward based on the above situation and problems.

I. Open cost and democratic evaluation have been proved by facts to be the best way to run cooperative societies well. Cooperative societies in various places must adopt a positive and responsible attitude to universally and deeply carry out this work. It is necessary to oppose formalism and purely task-oriented views in open cost and democratic evaluation. It is necessary to proceed from reality, with higher-level cooperative societies taking the lead, implementing level by level, and effectively implementing it.

II. Democratic evaluation should be combined with leadership approval. Prevent excessive price reductions and the phenomenon of extreme democratization. It should both enable members to get tangible benefits and enable cooperative societies to have appropriate capital accumulation.

III. Open cost and democratic evaluation must be combined with improving management. If we do not actively improve management and strive to reduce costs, we will not be able to consolidate the results of open cost and democratic evaluation. Conversely, without open cost and democratic evaluation, we cannot realize the economic democratic demands of members, and management will not be truly improved.

IV. Open cost and democratic evaluation should first start with major commodities and be implemented gradually in batches. The calculation of costs must be accurate and true, and the erroneous practice of underreporting more and being lenient and narrow should be opposed.

V. In terms of methods and steps, first, we must carefully examine capitalist management thinking and criticize the bad style of work that has been divorced from the masses in the past. Raise the political consciousness of cooperative society cadres and establish a correct view of facing the grassroots, facing the members, and facing production. Secondly, we must do a good job in specific preparatory work, calculate the cost of various commodities in advance, formulate a price list (which should be compared with the listed price and the market price), and publish it. Then, convene a meeting to formally disclose the cost, conduct the evaluation, and invite party and government leading comrades to participate in the guidance. The evaluation results should be reported to the higher-level cooperative society and the relevant financial and economic committee for approval and implementation. In short, open cost and democratic evaluation must be carried out in a planned, led, and step-by-step manner.

    华北区合作社实行公开成本民主评价的情况和问题
    史凌云
    自河北省定县专区创造了合作社实行公开成本民主评价的经验后，华北区合作总社于八月间通报全区各省、市合作社，号召大家坚决推广这一经验。各级合作社在增产节约竞赛运动中，把公开成本、民主评价作为实现民主管理、改进业务经营的重要方法，同时，也把它当作改造合作社工作人员思想的运动，因此，在不到两个月的时间内，全区已广泛推行这种办法，而以河北、平原两省合作社开展得比较普遍和深入。
    经过两个月来的实践，进一步证明了公开成本、民主评价的好处。
    一、进一步克服了资本主义经营思想，更加明确了合作社“面向社员、面向生产”的业务方针。各级社实行公开成本、民主评价的时候，普遍检查了资本主义经营思想，使合作社干部普遍认识到资本主义经营思想的严重性。平原省获嘉县太山庙乡村社检查出过去对社员“有利就干，没利就算”的错误作法：该社向花纱布公司交皮棉四千斤，仅升级一项就得非法利润一七○万元；滴滴涕（杀虫药）每斤进货成本一万六千元，却售价三万二千元，河北无极县社过去由专区社购进的男袜，每打六一、二○○元，转手供给基层社，每打增至七九、○○○元，毛利率达百分之二十二点五。曲阳下河村社每个手电筒的售价较当地百货公司高三、七○○元。各地合作社检查、批判了资本主义的经营思想和经营方式以后，使合作社干部更加明确了“为社员服务，为生产服务”的经营方针，树立了“货真价实态度好，秤平斗满尺码足”的经营作风，广大社员群众非常满意。事实证明：各级合作社能否认真地公开成本和民主评价，关键在于合作社的干部能否下决心清除资本主义经营思想，和是否清除了资本主义经营思想。
    二、充实了民主办社的内容，密切了上级社与下级社、基层社与社员、合作社与有关部门的关系，使社员对合作社更加信任。从前各地虽然也提倡
    “民主办社”，但一般合作社作的是很不够的。经过公开成本和民主评价，许多社员反映说：“叫咱们参加评价，这才像个东家的样儿”。有些社员还自觉地检讨了过去不关心合作社和想占合作社便宜的坏思想。河北曲阳县许多基层社过去怀疑县社的货价高，不愿去购货；但自县社实行公开成本、民主评价后，全县所有基层社都向县社购货了。各地合作社经过公开成本、民主评价后，当地党政领导机关更加重视了合作社的工作，加强了对合作社的领导与帮助。
    三、使商品价格更加合理，清除了商品积压现象，加速了商品周转，扩大了业务，相对地降低了商品流转费。察哈尔怀来县马家坟社民主评价时，社员认为收购杏仁的价格太高，经过讨论，适当地降低了；原来售价较低的八种商品，则适当提高了。河北定县东亭村社民主评定九种主要商品的价格，平均较前降低百分之五点九，比国营贸易公司零售价低百分之三点七，比私商价低百分之二十九点二。合作社货价降低以后，积存的冷背货都销出了，营业额直线上升。由于营业额扩大了，商品流转费相对地降低了，因此，毛利率虽然减少，纯益率反而增加了。定县东街联村社第一、二季度毛利率平均为六点五，公开成本后（七月份）降为五点三，商品流转费由二点四降至一点二，纯益率反由二点三增至三点三，资金周转率第一季度为三点二，七月份一个月即达一点八；商品周转率第一季度为六点二，七月份一个月即达三点七。
    这些，都充分说明了合作社公开成本民主评价的巨大作用。
    目前华北各地合作社公开成本、民主评价的主要问题是不深入、不平衡。河北、平原、山西省合作社作得较好，而北京、天津、察哈尔、绥远等省市作得还不普遍，有些地区还未深入到基层社及社员群众中去。有的地区的合作社实行公开成本、民主评价的时候，还发生了单纯任务观点、敷衍应付和形式主义的偏向。有的合作社只公开利润小的商品，不公开利润大的商品；或只公开冷背货的成本，不公开畅销货的成本；有的社甚至在公开成本时仍然保存暗藏利润，实际上扩大了成本。显然，这些都是错误的。
    为了把合作社的公开成本民主评价的工作作得更好，根据上述的情况和问题，提出以下几点意见。
    一、公开成本、民主评价，已被事实证明是办好合作社的最好办法。各地合作社必须采取积极负责的态度，普遍、深入地开展这一工作。要反对公开成本民主评价中的形式主义和单纯任务观点。要从实际出发，由上级社带头，逐级贯彻，切实实行。
    二、民主评价应与领导核准相结合。防止过份压低售价以及极端民主化的现象。应该既使社员得到实惠，又使合作社有适当的资金积累。
    三、公开成本、民主评价必须与改善经营相结合。如果不积极改善经营，力求降低成本，就无法巩固公开成本、民主评价的成果。反之，不实行公开成本、民主评价，就不能实现社员在经济上的民主要求，经营也就不会真正改善。
    四、公开成本、民主评价应先从主要商品开始，分期分批地逐步实施。计算成本要精确、真实，反对以少报多，宽打窄用的错误作法。
    五、在作法与步骤上，首先要认真检查资本主义经营思想，批判过去脱离群众的恶劣作风。提高合作社干部的政治觉悟，树立面向基层、面向社员、面向生产的正确观点。其次，要作好具体准备工作，事先算出各种商品的成本，拟订售价单（要与牌价市价作成比较），并将其公布，然后召开会议，正式公开成本、进行评价，并请党政领导同志参加指导。评价结果要报告上级社和相关的财政经济委员会核准施行。总之，公开成本民主评价必须是有计划、有领导、有步骤的进行。
