    Thoroughly Eradicate Old Legal Viewpoints
    Editor: After reading Comrade Wang Ruqi's article "Thoroughly Eradicate the Influence of the Pseudo-Civil Law's 'Family Law' and Safeguard the Legitimate Rights and Interests of Women in New China" on the third page of the People's Daily, we recalled that when the Marriage Law was promulgated, it was as if a flower bloomed in the hearts of every woman, and everyone thanked Chairman Mao for bringing light and happiness. However, after the promulgation of the Marriage Law, we still often see many reports of women being persecuted and even dying in the newspapers. Many of these are caused by the old legal viewpoints or old judicial work styles of judicial personnel. For example, the case of He Lai Suo murdering his wife in Wenshui County, Shanxi Province, mentioned in Comrade Wang Ruqi's article, really makes us extremely angry. The Shanxi Provincial People's Court lightly dealt with that criminal, He Lai Suo, who is worse than a beast, as "manslaughter," which is truly intolerable.
    In the past three years, our women have made great achievements in various fields, and we will continue to play an active and creative role in various positions in the future. In order to ensure the smooth development of the country's large-scale economic construction, to protect the legitimate rights and interests of women, and to implement the Marriage Law, we loudly appeal: resolutely support judicial reform, thoroughly eradicate all old legal viewpoints and old judicial work styles that trample on the legitimate rights and interests of women, and punish criminals who seriously endanger women.
    We are people's teachers in New China. We must work hard to improve our political understanding, educate the next generation well, and make them defenders and builders of the motherland. We are willing to encourage and supervise each other with sisters from all walks of life. At present, we must assist the people's government in exposing the old legal viewpoints and old judicial work styles of judicial personnel in various places, and strive to win the victory of the judicial reform movement as soon as possible.

### 彻底肃清旧法观点

    彻底肃清旧法观点
    编辑同志：我们读了人民日报第三版王汝琪同志写的“彻底肃清伪民法‘亲属编’的影响，保障新中国妇女的合法权益”一文后，回想起婚姻法颁布时，我们每个妇女的心上都好像开了一朵鲜花，人人都感谢毛主席给带来了光明和幸福。可是婚姻法颁布以后，依然常常在报纸上看到许多关于妇女受迫害甚至死亡的事件。这当中，很多是由于司法人员的旧法观点或旧司法作风所造成的。如王汝琪同志文中说的山西省文水县和来锁害死妻子一案，真使我们愤怒极了。对那比野兽还不如的凶犯和来锁，山西省人民法院却轻轻地以“过失杀人”处理过去，真是令人不能容忍。
    三年来，我们妇女在各方面的成就是很大的，今后当在各种岗位上继续发挥积极性、创造性。为了保障祖国大规模的经济建设顺利开展，为了保障妇女的合法权益，为了贯彻执行婚姻法，我们大声疾呼：坚决拥护司法改革，彻底肃清一切蹂躏妇女合法权益的旧法观点和旧司法作风，并惩办严重危害妇女的罪犯。
    我们是新中国的人民教师。我们一定努力提高政治认识，教好第二代，使他们成为祖国的保卫者和建设者。我们愿意和各界的姊妹们一起，互相勉励、督促。当前，我们要协助人民政府揭发各地司法人员的旧法观点和旧司法作风，争取早日获得司法改革运动的胜利。
