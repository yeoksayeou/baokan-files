    (I)
    As a Japanese, I sincerely thank the gentlemen of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese people for their enormous contribution to this historically significant meeting of representatives from Asian and Pacific countries, gathered together to jointly defend the peace of the Asian and Pacific region.
    This conference is of particular significance to the Japanese people. Having experienced the pain of the aggressive wars launched by militarists in the past and the subsequent occupation by foreign troops, the Japanese people have come to realize the following: In recent decades, the Japanese people, under the rule and command of militarism, were forced into aggressive and hostile relations with the nations of Asia, resulting in numerous disasters for the Asian nations and great suffering for the Japanese themselves. But now, under the rule of foreign occupiers and militarists, Japan is about to be forced again to become the "tyrant" and "orphan" of Asia, a tool for new aggressive wars, and once again enter into hostile relations with the nations of Asia. How can we Japanese remain silent? "Never repeat this mistake." Never allow the aggressive militarist forces to revive. Precisely for this reason, the Japanese are sparing no effort in defending peace, and the Japanese people hope to convey this sentiment to the nations of Asia and the Pacific region, and are willing to work together for peace. Today's conference precisely fulfills this hope of the Japanese people.
    I am here to express this irrepressible hope of the Japanese people. At the same time, I want to tell you that the Japanese people deeply feel their responsibility for having allowed Japanese militarism to carry out aggressive wars, causing unprecedented war disasters to the people of China, Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, Thailand, Burma, Indonesia, the Philippines, and other Asian nations. Taking China as an example, Japanese militarism, in its long war of aggression against China, caused the Chinese people to suffer more than ten million deaths and property losses of more than fifty billion US dollars. This is the most serious consequence of our failure as Japanese to stop the bloody aggression of Japanese militarist forces. However, we Japanese have also tasted the bitter fruit of this consequence. We have experienced all kinds of suffering during the war and the great disasters of being under foreign occupation after the defeat. It is precisely this self-reproaching thought that has prompted the Japanese people to be determined not to let Japanese militarism revive and make Japan a tool for aggressive war again.
    At this moment, the Special Session of the World Peace Council pointed out that peacefully resolving the issues of Germany and Japan is the central issue in the current cause of defending world peace. We believe that this resolution is pointing out the path forward for the Japanese people who demand peace in Japan and Asia. I earnestly hope that this conference will raise the Japanese issue as a central issue in defending the peace of the Asian and Pacific region and provide assistance to the Japanese people. This is the demand of all peace-loving Japanese people, and I believe it is also the demand of all the people of the Asian and Pacific region.
    (II)
    The more sincerely the nations of the Asian and Pacific region demand peace, the more deeply they feel the pain of the situation that is undermining and threatening the peace of this region, and the more concerned they are about the trend of Japanese militarism reviving and its possible recurrence of aggression. After accepting the Potsdam Proclamation and announcing unconditional surrender, Japanese militarism, seven years later, under the support of foreign occupiers, openly reveals its ferocious posture again, and the whole of Japan has become an outright military fortress under the rule of foreign occupiers and Japanese militarism. Isn't this an ironclad fact? Aren't a handful of warmongers already using Japan as a base to wage the incredibly cruel Korean War? Aren't they attempting to use Japan as a military base to expand the war to China, Southeast Asia, and other regions of Asia and Australia?
    This situation in Japan is the result of close cooperation between the American occupiers and the Yoshida government over the past few years. A year ago, the separate peace treaty and the US-Japan bilateral security treaty were signed in San Francisco. These two treaties stipulate that US troops will permanently occupy Japan, build unlimited military bases in Japan, and implement Japan's rearmament, thus making Japan an ally of the American aggressors and making it difficult to quickly end the state of war between Japan and several countries. These two treaties are truly war alliance treaties that make Japan an enemy of all the people of Asia.
    And this alliance is between the American warmongers who are recklessly slaughtering the Korean people and the Japanese militarists who are holding hands stained with the blood of the Asian people, and now holding American-made weapons, attempting to replay aggression against the Asian people. This proves that this alliance has a common foundation. On the one hand, the American warmongers, in order to invade Asia, attempt to have the Japanese militarists assist them and turn Japan into a tool for new aggressive wars; on the other hand, the Japanese militarists, in order to revive and realize their old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," attempt to use American aid to restore their own power in Asia. The basis of this alliance is to use Asia's most developed Japanese industry, Japan's strategic position, and its vast manpower to prepare for and wage new aggressive wars. Here lies a new threat to Asia—the issue of the revival of Japanese militarism. Therefore, the Japanese militarists, who in fact controlled the Japanese state organs long before the conclusion of the separate peace treaty, later abandoned their masks and openly appeared. The only difference from the past is that they wear American-style hats, American suits, and are armed with authentic American-made weapons. In this way, Japanese rearmament is openly underway, a military police state has reappeared, and Japanese industry has become a military industry.
    Now, the goal of foreign occupiers and Japanese militarists in rearming Japan is to establish a 300,000-strong army by the middle of next year, and they plan to first establish a small navy and air force. Therefore, they are preparing to implement conscription. At the same time, the Security Agency, which will become the future Ministry of Defense, has been established, with Yoshida himself serving as the Director-General of the Security Agency. The core of this army is the 75,000-strong police reserve force established after the start of the Korean War. This police reserve force is planned to be increased to 110,000 or even 200,000 this year, and has now been equipped with heavy weapons such as aircraft and tanks, and has begun combat exercises. On the other hand, Japan's police force has increased from 50,000 before the war to over 120,000. The government has formulated many repressive bills such as the "Prevention of Destructive Activities Bill" to deprive citizens of all freedom. The state apparatus has become a military police, fascist apparatus. For the sake of the US military and Japan's rearmament, Japan's major industries have been rapidly reorganized into military industries, and recently have begun producing complete weapons including aircraft and warships. This newly established Japanese armed force is not a self-defense force for the Japanese people, but an armed force for external aggression and internal oppression of the Japanese people. It is a threat and disaster to the Japanese people and to the people of other regions in Asia and the Pacific.
    In this way, the Japanese government's foreign policy has clearly pointed out that their direction is to act as the main accomplice of the United States in launching new aggressive wars in the East. For example, the Yoshida government, in accordance with the Battle Act aimed at politically and economically blockading the Soviet Union and China, prohibits trade with the Soviet Union and China. In reality, it is not the Soviet Union or China that mainly suffers from the blockade, but the Japanese economy and people's lives themselves. Recently, it has further accepted the US "Mutual Security Program" and implemented the so-called "Southeast Asia Development Plan" to plunder strategic materials from these countries and assist the US imperialists in building military bases in these countries. The Yoshida government has also concluded a so-called "peace treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek exile regime in Taiwan, openly antagonizing China, and conspiring to expel the Soviet representative from Japan. Recently, at the Honolulu Conference of the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, the United States also plans to include Japan within the scope of so-called "common security," attempting to form an Asian version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—the Pacific Alliance—with Japan as the core, and to make the rearmed Japanese army its main force.
    The world's most insane aggressor, whose essence was fully exposed in World War II, is forming an alliance with new aggressors, attempting to turn Japan into a source of new wars. On August 4th, Prime Minister Yoshida, on behalf of Japan's aggressors, declared to the world his intention that "the police reserve force is the foundation for building the national army, and the new Japan will lead Asia to join the world political stage."
    (III)
    But you representatives may ask: "What exactly are the Japanese doing?" This is a very important question. Because if the Japanese do not fight for peace, they will repeat the mistakes of the past and allow themselves to be led by militarism to the path of national subjugation and extinction, which is in any case not permissible to the Japanese people themselves. The Japanese people have begun to awaken and clearly realize that it is their serious responsibility to unite with the nations of Asia and the Pacific region and work together to eliminate the threat of the revival of Japanese militarism.
    I can proudly tell you that the Japanese people have shown unprecedented courage and are fighting for peace against war.
    We, the Japanese people, have come to understand that if we do not prevent the crisis of a new war based on Japan, we cannot win the liberation we desire from the American occupation system, establish a democratic country, and have a life of freedom and happiness. In fact, the characteristics of the lives of the Japanese people today are: filled with unemployed people in cities and villages, slave-like labor and insufficient wages, ruinous heavy taxes, soaring prices, destruction of agriculture and industry, destruction of national culture, and the enslavement of the entire nation. And the root of all these characteristics at present is first and foremost the American occupation and the revival of Japanese militarism. In the year since the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" was signed, the Japanese people have realized that the separate peace imposed on them by the US and Japanese governments is to throw them into rearmament and new aggressive wars, and therefore are greatly angered. Faced with such a painful reality, would there be a nation that does not sincerely demand peace?
    Therefore, the movement to defend peace is increasingly penetrating into the cities, villages, and all national strata of Japan. This movement is developing with the demands of opposing rearmament, "no interference in Korea," abolishing war treaties, and realizing overall peace. For example, the signature campaign against rearmament and demanding overall peace, which was conducted at the same time as the signature campaign for the peace treaty with the five major powers, reached more than six million people, which shows the general trend. The "General Council of Trade Unions of Japan," the largest trade union in Japan with three million members, and the "Japan Farmers Association" have also put forward peace programs with the same demands as above, which demonstrates the strong demand for peace by Japanese workers and farmers. In particular, young people, students, and women, under the common slogan of "do not join the police reserve force" and "do not be American mercenaries," are standing at the forefront of the struggle against rearmament, and are now launching a signature campaign against conscription with a target of twenty million signatures. Many scholars, religious figures, cultural figures, and general intellectuals have also actively participated in the peace movement; while protesting against the suppression of the peace movement, they are zealously appealing to the people in lectures, sermons, essays, on the streets, and at gatherings: "If we lose freedom now, the Japanese people will be thrown into war again."
    A national movement is developing among many industrialists, financiers, political party figures, progressives from all walks of life, workers, and citizens demanding the resumption of trade with China and the Soviet Union. For example, National Assembly members Torao Takara and Keishichi Hozumi, and former National Assembly member Kisuke Miyakoshi, despite the oppression of the US military and the Yoshida government, attended the Moscow International Economic Conference and later signed a 30 million pound Sino-Japanese trade agreement in Beijing. When they returned home, they were warmly welcomed by the masses across the country. This shows the breadth of this movement. The most important significance of this movement lies in the fact that the Japanese people, who have been placed under blockade by the US-Japan war instigators due to the separate peace, are attempting to rely on their own strength to establish peaceful and friendly relations with the Soviet Union and China. This shows that the Japanese people have opened up a path to ensure that they move towards establishing peaceful and friendly relations with the nations of Asia and the world.
    Just as the fact that one hundred and several tens of thousands of people across the country personally elected four hundred candidates to attend the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference demonstrates, the Japanese people have expressed strong support for this conference because they regard it as a path to peace.
    The US government has fabricated the statement that "the majority of the Japanese people support the US-made separate peace treaty." This is a complete lie. Our glorious peace fighter Joliot-Curie asserted at the special meeting of the World Peace Council: "No one will be fooled. Such a grand demonstration as on May 1st this year... can illustrate this point." Chairman of the British Peace Committee, Mr. Sheffield, also pointed out at the same meeting: "The demonstration held by the Japanese people on May Day showed their unanimous will and let the world know that they will never stand idly by in the face of these attempts to drag them back into war." Therefore, the special meeting of the World Peace Council issued a statement "expressing respect for the heroic struggle of the Japanese people for peace, independence, and democracy, and against militarist forces and war forces."
    (IV)
    I must emphasize that the purpose of the Japanese people's struggle for peace is to achieve friendship and unity with the nations of Asia and to conduct normal trade with the countries in the Asian and Pacific region on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, which has become the most urgent demand of all sectors of the Japanese people.
    The Japanese people deeply know that despite the heavy obstacles and difficulties on their path, despite the blockade and division created by foreign occupiers and domestic reactionaries, they are not isolated. The Japanese people are standing in the ranks of peace just like the nations of Asia and the Pacific region. No, the Japanese people are not only standing in the ranks, but also standing on its front line. We believe that it is our greatest glory to fight to the end to defend the peace of Asia in one of the largest strongholds of the world's war instigators in the East. We, who have already engaged in a life-and-death struggle on this deployment to stop a new war in Asia, sincerely hope to unite closely with the nations of Asia and the Pacific region to boldly advance this common cause of defeating war and winning peace. What is this path? We believe that the current path is for Japan to conclude a comprehensive treaty with the countries concerned; to oppose the one-sided treaty that creates war, and to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism.
    The cause of the unbearable suffering of the Japanese people at present is foreign occupation, the revival of Japanese militarism, and the crisis of war deepened by the San Francisco Treaty. This is what we feel deeply. This separate peace treaty with Japan tramples on the Potsdam Proclamation that the people of the world exchanged with blood, betrays the interests of the Japanese people, and threatens the peaceful order of Asia. All those who hate the revival of Japanese militarism, oppose the actions of world aggressors, and demand peace cannot allow the existence and continuation of this war treaty. We believe that the time has come to demand a peace treaty to replace the war treaty and to start the struggle. This is not only the common great cause of the Japanese people, but also of the nations of the Asian and Pacific region. Replacing the separate treaty with a comprehensive treaty is an obligation to international agreements and a responsibility to peace. We must carry out a persistent struggle for its realization.
    So what is the comprehensive peace that we demand? This is what the resolution of the Special Session of the World Peace Council on the Japanese issue has clearly defined. That is: to withdraw foreign occupation forces from Japan, to prohibit foreign countries from establishing military bases in Japan, to guarantee the integrity of the sovereignty of the Japanese nation, and to recognize its right to peaceful and democratic development. This is the natural democratic right of the nation that cannot be deprived in any case, as the World Peace Council has repeatedly advocated. If this is recognized, that is, the national independent sovereignty is respected and the internal affairs are not subject to any external interference, then the people of all nations, despite different political systems and different lifestyles, can completely live in peace, interact equally, and share what they have, so that international disputes can be resolved through peaceful consultation and eliminate the scourge of war. This is the principle of maintaining peace. We can see very clearly that precisely because this legitimate right and demand has been violated, all nations have suffered the threat of war, whether in Europe or in Asia.
    We, the Japanese people, like the nations of the Asian and Pacific region, resolutely oppose the San Francisco separate peace treaty with Japan and advocate the conclusion of a genuine treaty in accordance with international regulations, that is, a treaty of a comprehensive nature, to ensure lasting peace in the Asian and Pacific region.
    We, the Japanese people, like the nations of the Asian and Pacific region, resolutely demand that there be not a single foreign soldier on our territory.
    We, the Japanese people, like the nations of the Asian and Pacific region, resolutely demand that there be not a single foreign military base on our territory.
    We, the Japanese people, like the nations of the Asian and Pacific region, resolutely demand the right to a peaceful, independent, democratic, and free life.
    This is not only in the interest of the Japanese nation, but also fully in line with the interests of the nations of the Asian and Pacific region.
    We clearly know that it is not easy to get the imperialists to abandon their current aggression plans and to realize our demands, and a difficult struggle process must be gone through. At the same time, the solution of this major issue related to the security of the Asian and Pacific region is also impossible without the joint efforts of the broad masses of people in the Asian and Pacific region. We, the Japanese people, are willing to work together with the people of the countries in the Asian and Pacific region to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and defend the peace of the Asian and Pacific region. We, the Japanese people, have also used our own actions to express this determination. The convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference has greatly encouraged the Japanese people's will to fight for peace. Over one hundred and several tens of thousands of people across the country, overcoming all difficulties, elected more than four hundred candidates to attend the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, and these four hundred candidates mutually elected sixty representatives. Although most of these representatives have not been able to attend the conference today due to the obstruction of the reactionaries, the determination of the Japanese people to fight for peace together with the people of the Asian and Pacific region cannot be obstructed by any reactionaries. The people of the Asian and Pacific region have also given warm sympathy and support to the situation and struggle of the Japanese people. The signing of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement in June this year, and the support of the Chinese people for the "Matsukawa" incident of the Yoshida government's persecution of railway workers last January, are powerful proofs. We believe that as long as the people of the Asian and Pacific region work together, the conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism will surely fail, and peace in the Far East and the world will surely be guaranteed!

    日本代表龟田东伍
    关于日本问题的报告
    （一）
    我作为一个日本人，衷心感谢中国保卫和平委员会的先生们和中国人民，因为他们对于亚洲和太平洋各国人民代表这次集合在一起，举行历史上具有重大意义的会议，来同心协力保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平，是有最巨大的贡献的。
    这次会议对日本国民说来，有特别重大的意义。日本国民从过去军国主义者发动的侵略战争及其失败后遭受外国军队占领的痛苦中，体验到以下的事实：即最近几十年来，日本人由于在军国主义的统治和指挥下被迫对亚洲各民族处于侵略和敌对的关系，结果就使亚洲各民族遭受许多灾难，也使日本人自己遭受极大的灾难。但是，日本现在又在外国占领者和军国主义者统治之下将要重新被迫成为亚洲的“独夫”和“孤儿”，成为新的侵略战争的工具，再度和亚洲各民族发生敌对关系。我们日本人怎样能够默不作声呢？“绝不能重复这个错误”。绝不能再让侵略成性的军国主义势力复活。正因如此，日本人才不惜一切代价在保卫着和平，日本国民希望把这种心境告诉亚洲及太平洋区域的各民族，愿为和平共同奋斗。今天这个会议，恰好实现了日本人的这个希望。
    我在这里，表达日本人这一不能抑制的希望。同时告诉各位，日本国民由于他们曾经允许日本军国主义进行了侵略战争，使中国、朝鲜、越南、马来亚、泰国、缅甸、印尼、菲律宾等亚洲各民族遭受到空前的战祸，深深感觉到自己的责任。拿中国来说，日本军国主义在长期的侵华战争中，曾使中国人民遭受一千万以上人口的死亡和五百亿美元以上财产的损失。这是我们日本人没有能够制止日本军国主义势力的血腥侵略所招致的最严重的后果。不过，我们日本人也尝到了这一后果的苦汁，我们历尽了战争中的各种痛苦和战败后处于外国占领之下的极大的灾难。正是因为这种自己责备自己的思想，促使日本国民抱定决心，决不让日本军国主义复活，使日本重新成为侵略战争的工具。
    正在这时，世界和平理事会特别会议指出：和平解决德国和日本问题是目前保卫世界和平事业的中心问题。我们相信，这个决议正向要求日本和亚洲和平的日本国民，指出了应该前进的道路。我迫切地希望，这次会议把日本问题作为保卫亚洲及太平洋区域和平的一个中心问题提出来讨论，并对日本国民给予援助，这是所有爱好和平的日本人民的要求，同时我相信这也是全亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的要求。
    （二）
    亚洲及太平洋区域的各民族越是衷心地要求和平，那末，对于破坏和威胁这个区域和平的形势，对于日本军国主义正在复活及其可能重演侵略的趋势，就越益感到痛心。接受了波茨坦公告，宣布无条件投降后的日本军国主义，在七年以后的今天，在外国占领者的扶植下又公开地表露其凶恶的姿态，而整个日本成为外国占领者和日本军国主义统治之下的不折不扣的军事要塞，这难道不是铁的事实吗？一小撮战争贩子不是已经把日本作为基地，在进行着残酷无比的朝鲜战争吗？他们不是企图以日本作为军事基地，向中国、东南亚和亚洲、澳洲其他区域扩大战争吗？
    日本的这种形势，是美国占领者和吉田政府几年来紧密合作所造成的结果。一年前，在旧金山签订的是单独和约和日美双边安全条约。这两个条约规定，美军永久占领日本，在日本建设无限制的军事基地，实行日本重新武装，这样就使日本成为美国侵略者的同盟，使日本与若干国家的战争状态难以迅速终止，这两个条约正是使日本和全体亚洲人民为敌的真正的战争同盟条约。
    而这个同盟，是肆无忌惮地屠杀朝鲜人民的美国战争贩子与举着染有亚洲人民的血迹的手，现在又拿着美国造的武器，企图向亚洲人民重演侵略的日本军国主义者之间的同盟。这证明，这个同盟是有其共同基础的。在一方面，美国的战争贩子为了侵略亚洲，企图使日本军国主义者来协助自己，变日本为新的侵略战争的工具；在另一方面，日本军国主义者为了死灰复燃，重圆“大东亚共荣圈”旧梦，企图利用美国的援助来恢复他们自己在亚洲的势力，这个同盟的基础，就是利用亚洲最发达的日本工业，日本的战略地位和广大人力，来准备和进行新的侵略战争。这里正存在着亚洲的新威胁——即日本军国主义复活的问题。因此，早在单独和约缔结之前，事实上掌握日本国家机关的日本军国主义者，后来就抛弃了假面具，公开地出现了。只有一点和过去不同的是，他们头上戴的是美国式帽子，身穿美国洋服，用道地的美国造武器武装着而已。这样，日本重新武装公开地在进行，军事的警察的国家又重新出现，日本的工业也成为军事工业。
    现在，外国占领者和日本军国主义者重新武装日本的目标是：于明年中建立三十万陆军，并计划暂先建立小型的海军和空军，因此，正准备实行征兵制。同时，设立了将成为未来之国防省的保安厅，由吉田亲任保安厅长官。这个军队的核心，就是在朝鲜战争开始后即建立的七万五千名警察后备队。这个警察后备队计划在今年内就增加到十一万以至二十万人，现在已装备上飞机、战车等重武器，开始了战斗演习。另一方面，日本的警察力量已由战前的五万增加到十二万以上，政府制订了剥夺国民一切自由的“防止破坏活动法案”等许多镇压法案，国家机构已成为军事警察的、法西斯机构。为了美军和日本的重新武装，日本的主要工业已迅速改编成为军事工业，最近已着手生产包括飞机和军舰等的完整的武器。这种重新建立起来的日本武装，并不是日本人民的自卫武装，而是对外实行侵略、对内压迫日本人民的武装。它对于日本人民和对于亚洲及太平洋其他地区人民一样，都是一种威胁和灾害。
    这样，日本政府的对外政策已明确地指出他们的方向是充当美国在东方发动新的侵略战争的主要帮凶。例如，吉田政府按照旨在从政治上与经济上封锁苏、中的巴特尔法，禁止与苏、中两国的贸易，而实际上主要遭受封锁灾害的既不是苏联也不是中国，而是日本经济和人民生活自身。最近更接受美国的“相互安全计划”，实行所谓“东南亚开发计划”，以掠夺这些国家的战略物资，协助美帝在这些国家建设军事基地。吉田政府又与台湾蒋介石流亡政权缔结所谓“和平条约”，公开与中国为敌，并阴谋把苏联驻日代表逐出日本。最近，在美、澳、新三国的檀香山会议上，美国又计划把日本包括在所谓“共同安全”的范围之内，企图以日本为核心组成北大西洋公约的亚洲版——太平洋同盟，而把重新武装的日本军队作为他的主力。
    在第二次世界大战中已完全暴露了其本质的世界上最疯狂的侵略主义者正与新的侵略主义者结成同盟，企图把日本变成新战争的祸首。吉田首相于八月四日代表日本的侵略主义者向天下表明了“警察后备队是建设国军的基础，新日本将领导亚洲加入世界政治舞台”的意图。
    （三）
    但是各位代表先生们也许会问：“日本人究竟在干些什么呢？”这是很重要的问题。因为日本人如果没有为和平而进行斗争，日本人又将重复过去的错误，听任自己被军国主义引导到亡国灭种的道路上去，而这无论如何是日本国民自己所不能容许的。日本国民已经开始觉醒起来，清楚的认识到，和亚洲及太平洋区域各民族团结一致，共同努力消灭日本军国主义复活的威胁，是自己的严重的责任。
    我可以骄傲的告诉大家，日本国民已经表现了空前未有的勇气，为反对战争保卫和平而斗争。
    我们日本国民已经懂得了：如果不防止以日本为基地的新战争危机，就丝毫不能争取我们所渴望的从美国占领制度下解放出来，建立民主国家以及自由和幸福的生活。事实上，今天日本国民的生活的特征就是：充满在城市和农村中的失业者，奴隶般的劳动和不够生活的工资，倾家荡产的重税，高涨不已的物价，农业和工业的破坏，民族文化的毁灭，以及整个民族的奴隶化。而目前所有这些特征的根源则首先是美国的占领和日本军国主义的复活。自从旧金山“对日和约”签订以来的一年间，日本国民认识到美日两国政府所强加于他们身上的单独媾和，就是为了把他们投入重整军备和新的侵略战争之中，因此大为震怒。面临着这样痛苦的现实，难道会有一个民族不衷心地要求和平吗？
    因此，保卫和平的运动正日益深入到日本全国的城市、农村和一切国民阶层之中。这个运动正集中在反对重整军备，“不要干涉朝鲜”，废除战争条约，实现全面媾和的要求上而向前发展。例如与五大国和平公约的签名同时进行的反对重整军备、要求全面媾和的签名，竟达到了六百万人以上，由此可见一般。拥有三百万会员的日本最大工会“日本工会总评议会”和“日本农民协会”，也提出了和上述要求相同的和平纲领，这正说明了日本工人农民对于和平的强烈要求。特别是青年、学生和妇女，在“不要参加警察后备队”“不要当美国的雇佣兵”的共同口号之下，站在反对重整军备斗争的前列，现在正展开以二千万个签名为目标的反对征兵签名运动。很多的学者、宗教家、文化人、一般知识分子也都已积极地参加了和平运动；他们一面抗议对和平运动的镇压，一面在讲坛上，在传道和论文中，在街头和集会上热心地向国民呼吁：“现在如果失去了自由，日本国民就会再度被投入战争之中”。
    许多产业家、金融家、政党人士、各界进步人士、工人和市民要求恢复和中国、苏联的贸易的国民运动，正在发展。例如国会议员高良富和帆足计，前任国会议员宫腰喜助，他们三人不顾美军和吉田政府的压迫，出席莫斯科国际经济会议，后来又在北京签订了三千万英镑的日中贸易协议。当他们回国后，受到全国各地群众的热烈欢迎。这正说明了这个运动的广泛性。这个运动的最重要的意义是在于：因单独媾和而被美日战争挑拨者置于封锁之中的日本国民，企图依靠自己的力量建立他们和苏联、中国之间的和平、友好关系。这说明了日本国民已经要打开保证他们走向与亚洲及世界各民族建立和平、友好关系的道路。
    正如一百数十万群众在全国亲手选出了四百名出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表候选人这一事实所表现，日本国民之所以对这个会议表示了强烈的支持，也是因为把这个会议当作走向和平的道路。
    美国政府曾经捏造说：“大多数日本人民是支持美制的单独和约的。”这完全是谎话。我们光荣的和平战士约里奥—居里在世界和平理事会特别会议席上如此断言道：“没有人会受骗的。像今年五月一日那样盛大的示威，……都能说明这一点的。”英国和平委员会主席夏菲尔也在同一会议上指出：“日本人民在五一节举行的示威，显示了他们一致的意志，使全世界知道，对这些把他们重新拖入战争的企图，他们是决不会袖手旁观的。”因此，世界和平理事会特别会议发表声明，“对日本人民争取和平、独立与民主、反对军国主义势力和战争势力的英勇斗争表示敬意。”
    （四）
    我必须强调指出，日本国民为着和平而作过那样的斗争，其目的是希望和亚洲各民族取得友好和团结，并在平等互利基础上与亚洲及太平洋区域各国进行正常的贸易，这已成了日本国民各界共同一致的最迫切的要求。
    日本国民深知：尽管在自己的道路上有着重重的障碍和困难，尽管有外国占领者和国内反动派所造成的封锁和分割，但自己不是孤立的，日本国民是和亚洲及太平洋区域各民族同样站在和平的序列上。不，日本国民不仅已经站在序列上，而且是站在它的前线上。在世界战争挑拨者在东方的一个最大的根据地上，为着保卫亚洲的和平斗争到底，我们认为这种部署是我们最大的光荣。已经在这个部署上为着制止亚洲的新战争而作生死斗争的我们，衷心期望和亚洲及太平洋区域各民族紧紧地团结在一起，把这个打倒战争、争取和平胜利的共同事业，大胆地推向前进。这条道路是什么呢？我们认为当前这就是日本要与各有关国家订立全面性质的和约；反对制造战争的片面和约，并制止日本军国主义的复活。
    造成日本国民目前难以忍受的痛苦的原因，就是外国的占领，就是日本军国主义的复活，就是旧金山条约所加深了的战争的危机。这是我们切身所感到的。这一对日单独媾和，蹂躏了全世界人民用血换来的波茨坦公告，出卖了日本国民的利益，威胁了亚洲的和平秩序。一切憎恨日本军国主义复活、反对世界侵略主义者的行动及要求和平的人们，都不能允许这一战争条约的存在与继续。我们相信，现在要求以和平的条约来代替战争的条约，并开始斗争的时期已经来了。这不仅是日本国民，也同样是亚洲及太平洋区域各民族的共同的伟大的事业。以全面和约代替单独和约，是对国际协定的义务，是对和平的责任，我们必须为其实现而进行坚持的奋斗。
    那么我们要求的全面媾和，究竟是什么内容呢？这就是世界和平理事会特别会议对于日本问题决议所已明确了的东西。即：从日本撤退外国占领军，禁止外国在日本设立军事基地，保证日本民族的主权完整，承认其有和平民主的发展的权利。这就是如世界和平理事会所反复主张的，无论如何不能剥夺的民族的当然的民主权利。如果承认了这一点，即民族独立主权受到尊重，内政不受任何外来的干涉，那末，各民族人民之间，尽管政治制度不同，生活方式不同，却是完全能够和平相处、平等往来、有无相通，从而能够用和平协商方式解决国际争端，而消除战祸。这是保持和平的原则。我们可以看得很清楚，正由于侵犯了这一正当的权利与要求，不论在欧洲，不论在亚洲，使所有民族都遭受了战争的威胁。
    我们日本国民，和亚洲及太平洋区域各民族一样，坚决地反对旧金山的单独对日和约，而主张缔结按照国际规定的真正和约，即带有全面性质的和约，以保障亚洲及太平洋区域的持久和平。
    我们日本国民，和亚洲及太平洋区域各民族一样，坚决地要求在我国领土上没有一个外国兵。
    我们日本国民，和亚洲及太平洋区域各民族一样，坚决地要求在我国领土上没有一个外国的军事基地。
    我们日本国民，和亚洲及太平洋区域各民族一样，坚决地要求有和平、独立、民主、自由的生活的权利。
    这不仅是日本民族的利益，也是和亚洲及太平洋区域各民族的利益完全相符合的。
    我们清楚的知道，要帝国主义分子放下目前的侵略计划，来实现我们的要求，不是容易的，必须经过艰苦的奋斗过程。同时，这一有关亚洲及太平洋区域安全的重大问题的解决，没有亚洲及太平洋区域广大人民的共同努力，也是不可能的。我们日本国民愿意与亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民一道，共同为反对日本军国主义复活、保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平而努力。我们日本国民也已经用自己的行动，来表示了这一决心。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，极大地鼓舞了日本国民为和平而斗争的意志。全国一百数十万群众，冲破一切困难，选出了四百余名出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表候选人，由这四百余名候选人再互选出六十名代表。虽然这些代表的大多数，由于反动派的阻挠，今天未能出席会议，但是日本国民愿望与亚洲及太平洋区域人民共同为和平而奋斗的决心，不是任何反动派所能阻挠的。亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，对于日本国民的处境与斗争，同样给予了热烈的同情与支持。今年六月中日贸易协议的签订，与去年一月，中国人民对吉田政府陷害铁路工人的“松川”事件的支持，都是有力的证明。我们相信，只要亚洲及太平洋区域人民共同努力，复活日本军国主义的阴谋，就一定要失败，远东及世界和平就一定可以得到保障！  （新华社）
