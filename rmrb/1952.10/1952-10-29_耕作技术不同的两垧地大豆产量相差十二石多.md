    Two Hectares of Soybean Land Yield More Than Twelve Shi Difference Due to Different Farming Techniques

    Editor: The lands of Zhao Jingyang and Dong Changfeng, farmers in Guangrong Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, are right next to each other. Zhao Jingyang's one hectare of soybeans yielded seventeen shi; Dong Changfeng's one hectare of soybeans yielded only a little over four shi.

    Zhao Jingyang is very good at studying techniques and has applied a lot of manure to the fields for years; last year his hectare was planted with wheat, and he immediately cleared the stubble after harvesting the wheat. This year, he applied thirty-seven cartloads of well-rotted yellowish-brown manure; the seeds used were the excellent "Purple Flower No. 4" variety, selected by grain; they were mixed with rhizobium; when the seedlings grew to two inches tall, they were thinned once; he also paid close attention to applying top dressing, hoeing, and weeding. His soybean plants grew to be three feet tall, with many side branches, five or six branches per plant, dense pods, and many beans; most soybean plants had seventy-eight to ninety-five pods. The only shortcoming of his soybean field was that the seedlings were still not dense enough. If it weren't for this shortcoming, it would have been possible to harvest twenty-seven or twenty-eight shi per hectare.

    Dong Changfeng is very conservative and unwilling to accept new techniques. When planting in the spring, he said that Zhao Jingyang's increased production plan was just "idle chatter." He said: "Crops are planted in the ground and harvested from the sky; how can humans make them produce more grain!" His hectare was also planted with wheat last year, and he didn't clear the stubble until it was almost freezing; this year he only applied fifteen cartloads of yellowish-brown manure, and it wasn't applied evenly; he only hoed once, and the weeding wasn't timely; he didn't select seeds, didn't thin seedlings, and didn't apply top dressing. Therefore, the soybean plants only grew to be two feet tall, with only two or three branches per plant, sparse pods, and few beans; the entire plant only had twelve to sixteen pods.

    After seeing this contrasting situation, most of the people in the village said: This time, our minds are open; if we remain conservative, we will remain poor, and we must learn from Zhao Jingyang.

### 耕作技术不同的两垧地大豆产量相差十二石多

    耕作技术不同的两垧地大豆产量相差十二石多
    编辑同志：黑龙江省克山县光荣村农民赵景阳和董常凤的土地紧挨着。赵景阳的一垧大豆，打了十七石；董常凤的一垧大豆，只打了四石多。
    赵景阳很会钻研技术，连年又在地里上了很多粪；去年他这垧地种的是小麦，收了麦子，立即灭了槎子；今年又上了三十七车腐熟的土黄粪；用的种籽是经过粒选的紫花四号优良品种；拌了根瘤菌；苗子长到二寸高，间了一次苗；他对于施追肥、铲趟、除草也很注意。他的豆棵长得有三尺高，旁杆很多，一棵发五六个杈，豆荚很密，豆粒也多；大部分豆棵结了七十八个到九十五个荚。他的豆地美中不足的是仍然不够苗。如果没有这个缺点，每垧打二十七、八石也是可能的。
    董常凤很保守，不肯接受新的技术。春天种地的时候，他说赵景阳的增产计划不过是“闲扯”。他说：“庄稼是种在地下，收在天上，人还能叫它多打粮哪！”他这垧地去年也是种的小麦，一直到快上冻的时候才灭了槎子；今年只上了十五车土黄粪，而且上得不均匀；只铲趟了一遍，除草也不及时；没有选种，没有间苗，没有上追肥。因此，豆棵只长了二尺高，每棵只有两三个杈，荚也稀，粒也少；全棵只有十二个到十六个荚。
    看了这个对比的情形，村里大多数群众都说：这回脑筋可开了，再保守就老得受穷，非学习赵景阳不可。　赵俊　梅树先
