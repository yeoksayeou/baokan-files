	Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative Learned to Use the Weapon of Criticism and Self-Criticism
	By Our Correspondent Lu Sheng
	Conducting political and ideological education among members of agricultural mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, and farmers, and frequently carrying out criticism and self-criticism, is one of the driving forces for promoting the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. The Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, under the leadership and promotion of the CCP Xigou Village Branch in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, has made outstanding achievements in this regard.
	In December of last year, before the establishment of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, two kinds of thinking emerged among the members of the mutual aid team led by Li Shunda. One was represented by Li Shunda, Song Jinshan, Wang Zhouze, Zhang Qide, and others. Based on the group's mutual aid experience over the years and the conditions of Xigou Village, they believed that to continue increasing production, it was necessary to develop the collective labor and decentralized management of the mutual aid team into an agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative. Only in this way could the potential of mountain production be further exploited and surplus labor be rationally used. The other type of thinking was represented by Lu Wenquan. He believed that agricultural production had reached its peak given the conditions of Xigou Village and could not be further developed. He said, "One mu of land has more than thirty plots. The largest plot is no more than one mu. No matter how well organized, we can't use tractors to cultivate the land." He lost confidence in continuing to increase production and wanted to take the opportunity of organizing an agricultural production cooperative to withdraw from the mutual aid team and work independently. Under his influence, Ma Haixin and Wei Lixing and others also withdrew from the mutual aid team one after another.
	In order to solve the problem of the direction of rural economic development, and to launch mass criticism and self-criticism, the CCP Xigou Village Branch (Li Shunda is the branch secretary) first specifically analyzed the ideological situation of these old mutual aid team members who wanted to withdraw and work independently.
	Lu Wenquan originally came from a hired peasant background. Like Li Shunda, he was a poor farmer who had fled famine from Henan to Xigou Village. The land he is now cultivating was all opened up with a hoe, one hoe at a time, over the past twenty years, and terraced fields were built up one stone at a time. Before the Anti-Japanese War, like many poor peasants and hired laborers in Xigou Village, he could only eat sauerkraut soup made with small red radishes and sweet potato dumplings every year, in addition to renting land to landlords. When the Communist Party arrived in Pingshun at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the lives of him and the farmers of Xigou Village only gradually improved. Later, he joined the Communist Party. In every mass movement (such as rent reduction and interest rate reduction, land reform, and supporting the front line), he actively participated. However, why is it that now, when the farmers of the whole village urgently demand breaking the old mutual aid team form and further developing mountain production, he not only does not actively participate in the agricultural production cooperative, but instead wants to withdraw and work independently? The branch's research concluded that the basic reason for his wanting to withdraw from the mutual aid team was that he himself had not paid enough attention to political study in recent years, so he could not see the future of mountain production development, lost the courage to struggle against difficulties, and wanted to leave the mutual aid team to engage in sideline production and hire a farmhand to cultivate the land for him.
	Next, the branch specifically analyzed the reasons why Ma Haixin, Wei Lixing, and others wanted to withdraw and work independently.
	The Party branch believed that to get through to those who wanted to withdraw and work independently, it was necessary to conduct political and ideological education with concrete facts on the one hand, and to ensure that the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative truly made achievements and use facts to guide them to continue on the road of "organizing."
	With the establishment of the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative, the village branch led all party members to launch an ideological struggle between two lines. The branch led all party members to study Comrade Gao Gang's report on "The Direction of Rural Economic Development."
	Each party member, based on the spirit of Comrade Gao Gang's report, examined his own thoughts and launched criticism and self-criticism. Song Jinshan said, "Whoever wants to go back to the old road has forgotten his roots." He criticized Lu Wenquan, saying, "Comrade Lu Wenquan, why don't you continue on the road of organization? Have you forgotten the days when we first came to Xigou and built houses with sorghum stalks and made bowls and chopsticks with old melon rinds and grain stalks? How can you not want to move forward just because you have cornbread dumplings, old melon-braised rice, and bean noodle soup today? Comrade Gao Gang said: 'Communist Party members have the responsibility to persuade individual farmers to participate in cooperation and mutual assistance.' Not only did you not persuade those who wanted to work independently like Wei Lixing, but you took the lead in working independently and wanted to hire a farmhand to become a rich peasant. Without me saying it, think about what kind of road you are taking!"
	Party member Wang Zhouze recalled the painful life of the past and cried. He said, "In the past, the landlord divided the wasteland of Xigou into many small plots. Once, I was careless and opened a few more hoes outside the boundary line, and the landlord arrested me. It took a lot of effort to set up several tables of banquets and invite guests to settle the matter." He said to Lu Wenquan, "Comrade Lu Wenquan, how can you think of taking that old road again?" Lu Wenquan started to cry before Wang Zhouze finished speaking. He cried and said, "I was wrong. I am sorry to the Party, sorry to Chairman Mao, and sorry to the comrades for their many years of help and education. Because my political study is usually poor, my eyes can't see far. I only thought that the land is just that land, and no matter how much it develops, production can't be increased much. I can't see the future of mountain development, so I started to think wildly, wanting to go out and engage in sideline production to make money, and hire someone to cultivate the land at home. Now, after everyone's criticism, I understand that the road I wanted to take was a dead end, a road to exploit others and get rich myself..." Each party member made a self-examination and also criticized Lu Wenquan's wrong thinking. Lu Wenquan accepted everyone's opinions, admitted his mistakes, and expressed to the Party that he would resolutely correct his mistakes in practical action and persuade those few independent farmers to join the cooperative together. Finally, all the party members unanimously proposed: In order to thoroughly distinguish between these two kinds of thinking among the peasant masses, each party member must guarantee to do the following three things: First, each party member must publicize the situation of this meeting to all the cooperative members and the villagers, and mobilize the peasant masses to study Comrade Gao Gang's report, so that everyone can further recognize that organizing is the only way for us peasants to get rid of poverty forever and move towards prosperity; second, each party member must publicize to the peasants that the organizational form of the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative is the best organizational form to further exploit the production potential of Xigou Village; at the same time, publicize the great future of socialist society and communist society; third, each party member must strengthen political study, and the branch must strengthen the political and ideological education of each party member, especially to help Lu Wenquan correct his mistakes in practical action.
	After this branch meeting, a movement to study Comrade Gao Gang's report quickly unfolded throughout the village, and extensive criticism and self-criticism unfolded within the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative. After this study, the vast majority of farmers in the village increased their confidence in the development prospects of mountain production. The ideological struggle of the several old team members who withdrew from the mutual aid team was particularly acute. Ma Haixin felt very sad after hearing Lu Wenquan's ideological self-examination. He tossed and turned all night and couldn't sleep, regretting that he shouldn't have withdrawn from the production cooperative. Under Lu Wenquan's persuasion, Ma Haixin and Lu Wenquan combined with four independent farmers to form a mutual aid team. After the spring plowing, under the leadership of Lu Wenquan, the six households collectively joined the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative. When joining the cooperative, Ma Haixin made a very profound ideological self-examination at the village-wide peasant mass meeting. He said that before the spring plowing, their mutual aid team saw that the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative had rebuilt the old dikes that had been washed away over the years, and they also held a meeting to decide to rebuild the old dikes that had been washed away over the years. However, after the resolution, it could not be implemented, because everyone only wanted to rebuild their own dikes first, and the result was that each person went their own way. When delivering manure, their mutual aid team had been delivering for several days, and the cooperative was still holding meetings to assess the output of the land. At that time, he thought: If the mutual aid team is well managed, it might be able to outperform the cooperative! However, after a few days, the cooperative finished delivering the manure, and they had not yet finished. After the end of the spring plowing production, in addition to successfully completing the spring plowing and sowing plan, the cooperative also earned more than a thousand catties of millet in sideline production. The education of reality made him realize that the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative was indeed much better than the mutual aid team. He said, "After a spring of labor, I truly realized that the agricultural production cooperative is like a train, the mutual aid team is at best a car, and the individual household is an ox cart. To make production develop quickly, everyone should hurry up and buy a ticket to get on the 'train.' I bought a ticket in the spring and then refunded it, and as a result, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't catch up. This is a big lesson, and I hope everyone won't follow my example."
	The criticism and self-criticism work of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative is not only profound and timely, but also regular. They recognize that the further the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement develops, the more important the weapon of criticism and self-criticism becomes. Therefore, they can often use this weapon to promote the continuous progress of the cooperative.
	When plowing the land this spring, all the cooperative members stipulated that plowing two mu of land would be counted as a full day's labor, and the standard for plowing the land was stipulated as: plowing deep, plowing fine, and plowing evenly. However, in the process of plowing the land, some cooperative members often did not meet the stipulated standards in order to earn more labor days. One day, the cooperative members discovered that there were still grass leaves in the land plowed by Ma Yuxin. When they dug with their fingers, the grass roots were still firmly rooted in the hard soil. Everyone carefully checked it again and found that the land plowed by Ma Yuxin was rough, shallow, and uneven. The leadership of the cooperative and the Party branch jointly studied this problem and believed that after the establishment of the production cooperative, the overall interest thinking of all the cooperative members had not yet been established, so things that took petty advantages of the cooperative often happened, and everyone did not yet realize the truth that the cooperative's loss was also the individual's loss. The leadership of the cooperative and the Party branch decided to use this specific example to conduct a practical education for all the cooperative members.
	Ma Yuxin is a Communist Party member, and the leadership of the branch first let him make a self-criticism in the branch. At first, he said that the land was not plowed well because he was having meetings at night and dozing off during the day's labor. Later, the branch convened a general meeting of all party members to let all party members analyze this problem. Everyone first criticized that the objective reasons he said were not facts, pointing out that the essence of his thinking was to earn more work points, and the main reason for his mistakes was that he did not realize the consistency of personal interests and the interests of the cooperative. Song Jinshan said, "You said you were having meetings late at night, everyone was having meetings late at night, why did others plow well, but you didn't plow well? The main reason is that you wanted to earn more work points." After everyone's criticism and analysis, Ma Yuxin admitted his mistakes. Then, he made a public self-criticism at the cooperative members' mass meeting. The leadership of the cooperative, based on his own opinions and the opinions of the cooperative members, deducted the work points he had earned excessively. From then on, the concept of overall interest began to be established in the minds of party members and cooperative members.
	Now, criticism and self-criticism have become a regular system in the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative. They conduct criticism and self-criticism at every meeting they hold, and they also constantly carry out criticism and self-criticism in daily work and production. For example, when Shen Fanping grazed sheep, he often randomly hit the sheep with stones, and Qin Kelin criticized him for not loving everyone's property. "In the past, when I grazed sheep for the landlord, I would kill at least ten sheep a year. That was when I was oppressed and exploited. Now the sheep are all publicly owned by the cooperative. The cooperative is our home, and we should cherish every piece of property of the cooperative." After this criticism, Shen Fanping became particularly fond of the sheep. In practical experience, the members of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative have realized that criticism and self-criticism are the driving force for promoting the continuous progress of the cooperative.

    李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社学会了运用批评和自我批评的武器
    本报记者  鲁生
    对农业互助组员、农业生产合作社员和农民进行政治思想教育，经常开展批评和自我批评，是推动农业互助合作运动的动力之一。李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社在中共山西平顺县西沟村支部的领导和推动下，在这方面做出突出的成绩。
    去年十二月，在李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社成立以前，李顺达领导的互助组的组员中，产生了两种思想：一种以李顺达、宋金山、王周则、张起德等为代表。他们根据全组几年来的互助经验和西沟村的条件，认为要继续提高产量，必须把集体劳动、分散经营的互助组，发展为农林畜牧生产合作社。只有这样，才能进一步发挥山地生产的潜在力，合理使用剩余劳力。另一种思想以路文全为代表。他认为根据西沟村的条件，农业生产已经到顶了，不能再继续发展了。他说：“一亩地有三十多块。最大的块也不过一亩多。再组织的好，也不能用拖拉机种地。”他对继续提高产量失去了信心，要趁组织农业生产合作社的时机，退出互助组单干。在他的影响下，马海新和魏立兴等人也先后退出了互助组。
    为了解决农村经济的发展方向问题，展开群众性的批评和自我批评，中共西沟村支部（李顺达是支部书记）首先具体分析了这些要退组单干的老互助组员的思想情况。
    路文全原是雇农出身，他和李顺达一样，都是从河南逃荒到西沟村来的贫苦农民。他现在种的土地，都是二十年来用钁头一钁一钁地开出来，又用石头一块一块地垒成了梯田。抗日战争前，他和西沟村许多贫农、雇农一样，每年除给地主出租外，自己只能吃些小红萝卜配地瓜蛋的酸菜汤。抗日战争开始，共产党到了平顺，他和西沟村农民的生活才一天天好起来。以后他参加了共产党。在每一次群众运动里面（如减租减息，土地改革，支援前线），他都是积极参加的。但是，为什么现在全村农民迫切要求打破老互助组的形式，进一步发展山地生产的时候，他不但不积极参加农业生产合作社，反倒要退组单干呢？支部研究的结果，认为他要退出互助组的基本原因是：他本人最近几年来太不注意政治学习，因此就看不到山地发展生产的前途，失掉了对困难作斗争的勇气，想脱离互助组去搞副业生产，雇个长工给自己种地。
    接着，支部又具体地分析了马海新、魏立兴等人要退组单干的原因。
    党支部认为，要打通这些要求退组单干的人的思想，必须一方面用具体事实进行政治思想教育，一方面使农林畜牧生产合作社真正做出成绩来，拿事实引导他们继续走“组织起来”的道路。
    随着农林畜牧生产合作社的成立，村支部领导全体党员展开了两条路线的思想斗争。支部领导全体党员学习高岗同志的“关于农村经济发展的方向问题”的报告。
    每个党员都根据高岗同志报告的精神，检查了自己的思想，展开了批评和自我批评。宋金山说：“谁要想返回去走老路，谁就是忘了本。”他批评路文全说：“路文全同志，你为什么不再走组织起来的路呢？难道你忘记了我们刚来到西沟时用高粱秆搭房子，用老瓜皮谷草秆做碗筷的日子了吗？怎么今天刚刚有了玉米面窝窝、老瓜闷饭、豆面汤，就不想再往前走了呢？高岗同志说：‘共产党员有责任说服单干的农民参加合作互助。’你不但没有去说服想单干的魏立兴那些人，你自己还带头去单干，还想雇长工当富农，不用我说，你想想你走的这是条什么路！”
    党员王周则回想起过去的痛苦生活，哭起来了。他说：“从前地主把西沟的荒地划成好多小片，有一次，我没小心，在界限外多开了几钁头，地主就把我抓起来，好容易摆了几桌酒席请客，才算了事。”他对路文全说：“路文全同志，你怎么又想走那条旧路了呀？……”路文全没等王周则说完，也哭起来，他边哭边说：“我想错了，我对不起党，对不起毛主席，也对不起同志们多年来对我的帮助和教育。因为我平常政治学习差，眼睛看不远，只想着：土地就是那些土地了，再发展也不能提高多少产量，我看不见山地发展的前途，因此就胡思乱想起来，想自己出去搞副业赚钱，家里雇个人种地。现在经过大家的批评，我明白了，原来我想走的那条路是死路，是剥削别人自己发财的路……”每个党员都做了检查，也都对路文全的错误思想进行了批评。路文全接受了大家的意见，承认了错误，并向党表示：要在实际行动中坚决改正错误，并说服那几户单干农民一同入社。最后全体党员一致提出：为了在农民群众中彻底分清这两种思想，每个党员要保证做到以下三件事：第一，每个党员要把这次会议的情况向全体社员和全村农民群众作宣传，并发动农民群众学习高岗同志的报告，使大家进一步认识组织起来是我们农民永远摆脱穷困走向富裕的唯一道路；第二，每个党员都要向农民宣传：农林畜牧生产合作社的组织形式，是进一步发挥西沟村的生产潜在力的最好的组织形式；同时宣传社会主义社会和共产主义社会的远大前途；第三，每个党员要加强政治学习，支部要加强对每个党员的政治思想教育，特别要帮助路文全在实际行动里改正自己的错误。
    这次支部会议开过以后，全村很快地展开了学习高岗同志的报告的运动，李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社内，展开了广泛的批评和自我批评。经过这次学习，全村绝大多数农民对山区生产的发展前途增加了信心。退出互助组的几个老组员的思想斗争特别尖锐。马海新听了路文全的思想检查，心里非常难过，夜里翻来覆去睡不着，后悔不该退出生产合作社。在路文全的说服下，马海新又和路文全结合四户单干农民，成立了一个互助组。春耕结束后，在路文全的带领下，他们六户又集体加入了农林畜牧生产合作社。入社的时候，马海新很深刻地在全村农民群众大会上作了思想检查。他说，在春耕前，他们互助组看见农林畜牧生产合作社把历年来冲塌了的旧堰都垒起来了，他们也开会决定要垒起历年来冲塌的旧堰。但是，决议以后，老是不能实行，因为谁都只想先垒自己的堰，结果是各人干各人的去了。送粪的时候，他们互助组已经送了几天，合作社还在开会评订土地的产量。那时，他想：互助组要办的好，说不定还能赛过合作社呢！可是，没有几天，合作社送完了粪，他们还没有送完。春耕生产结束了，合作社除了胜利完成春耕播种计划以外，副业生产方面也赚了一千多斤小米。现实的教育使他认识了农林畜牧生产合作社确实比互助组优越得多。他说：“经过一春天的劳动，我真正认识了农业生产合作社好比是火车，互助组顶多是个汽车，单干户是老牛车，要使生产发展的快，大家要赶紧买票上‘火车’。我春天买了票，又退了，结果怎么赶也赶不上，这是一个大教训，希望大家不要再学我那样子。”
    李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社的批评和自我批评工作不但是深刻的及时的，而且还是经常的。他们认识了农业生产互助合作运动越向前发展，批评和自我批评的武器越加重要的道理，因此，能够经常运用这个武器，推动合作社不断前进。
    今年春天犁地时，全体社员规定犁二亩地算一个全劳动日，并规定犁地的标准是：犁深、犁细、犁匀。可是，在犁地的过程中，有些社员为了多赚劳动日，常常达不到规定的标准。有一天，社员们发现马玉新犁过的地里还有草叶，用手指一刨，草根还牢牢扎在硬土里。大家又仔细检查了一遍，发现马玉新犁的地又粗、又浅、又不匀。社的领导方面和党支部共同研究了这个问题，认为生产合作社成立以后，全体社员的整体利益思想还没有树立起来，因此常常发生占社的小便宜的事情，大家还不认识社里吃亏也就是个人吃亏的道理。社和党支部的领导方面决定通过这个具体例子，对全体社员进行一次实际的教育。
    马玉新是共产党员，支部领导方面首先让他在支部做检讨。开始，他说，地犁得不好是因为黑夜开会，白天劳动时打磕睡。后来支部又召开全体党员大会，让全体党员来分析这个问题。大家先批判他说的客观原因不是事实，指出他的思想本质是为了多赚工票，他犯错误的主要原因是没有认识到个人利益和社的利益的一致性。宋金山说：“你说黑夜开会晚，大家都开会晚呀，为什么别人犁得好，就你犁不好？主要原因还是你想多赚工票。”经过大家的批评分析，马玉新承认了他的错误。接着，他在社员群众大会上作了公开检讨。社的领导方面根据他自己的意见和社员群众的意见，扣除了他多赚的工分。从此，整体利益的观念开始在党员、社员的思想里树立起来了。
    现在，批评和自我批评已经在李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社里成为经常的制度。他们每举行会议，都要进行批评和自我批评，就是在日常工作和生产中，也不断进行着批评和自我批评。如申饭平放羊时，常常用石头乱打羊，秦克林就批评他不爱护大家的财产。“从前我给地主放羊，一年至少要打死十多只羊，那是被压迫被剥削时候的事。现在的羊群全是社里公有的，社就是咱们的家，社的任何一件财物我们都应该爱护。”经过这次批评后，申饭平对羊群就特别爱护起来了。在实际体验中，李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社的社员已认识到批评和自我批评是推动合作社不断进步的动力。
