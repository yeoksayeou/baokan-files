    October 12th - Polish Army Day
    Poland, Meng Nade
    Today is the anniversary of the historic battle that took place on October 12, 1943, in Lenin, Byelorussian Socialist Republic. The working people of the People's Republic of Poland solemnly commemorate the festival of their army.
    The first battle of the new armed forces of the Polish people was fought alongside the army of the Soviet Union on the fraternal Soviet soil near Lenin. This battle became a symbol of all the characteristics that determine the power of our army.
    Our army now has the ability to complete all the tasks given to it by the Polish people, our heroic working class, our government, and the working class's revolutionary party—the Polish United Workers' Party.
    In the battle near Lenin, Polish soldiers attacked the fascist positions in order to fight for the social and national liberation of the working people of their own country. These soldiers of the First Division, named after the great fighter for the liberation of the people, Tadeusz Kościuszko, were part of a force organized on the advice of Polish communists. These Polish communists, along with thousands of other Poles, received gracious hospitality on Soviet territory after our country was occupied by Hitler's Germany. The soldiers of our First Division were educated in the spirit of internationalism and proletarian patriotism. They were organized in the fraternal Soviet Union, under the care and comprehensive assistance of the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet Army, and the great Stalin. This army, shedding blood far from its homeland for "freedom for you and us," proved the eternal friendship between the Polish people and the Soviet people who liberated Poland from the shackles of Hitler's aggressors and its own exploiters. Close contact with the people, selfless struggle for the interests of the people and only the people; under the help, friendship, and demonstration of the new type of army—the Soviet Army, the Polish People's Army led by the working class—the main characteristic of the armed forces of our motherland. Therefore, the tradition of the battle near Lenin is particularly precious and intimate to our army and the working people of our country, and therefore this day has become the festival of the army of the People's Republic of Poland.
    The ideological face of the Polish People's Army is the ideological face of workers and working peasants. This also determines its class nature. The Polish army is a new type of army, in which every soldier deeply knows that they are defending the freedom of the working people in the face of the barbaric conspiracies of American imperialism, which is attempting to launch a new world war.
    The class nature of the Polish People's Army is closely related to its national character. The soldiers of our army deeply cherish the progressive traditions of the Polish people, and now all members of the army of the People's Republic of Poland are being educated in this tradition. The party of the working class is the organizer and educator of the Polish People's Army. Members of the Polish Communist Party were the organizers of the Polish First Army Corps in the Soviet Union, and they organized a second army corps in a part of the liberated Polish territory. Under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish army has become an unshakable, united army with soldiers and commanders possessing a high level of political thought and combat knowledge.
    The soldiers of the Polish People's Army recorded many outstanding achievements in their history in the course of fighting the Hitlerite bandits. From Lenin to Berlin is the combat journey of our army. This road was walked hand in hand with the heroic soldiers of the great, invincible Soviet Army. The soldiers of the Polish Army deeply respect and love President Bierut, the leader of the Polish people. Comrade Bierut is the leader of the Polish Communist Party. The Polish communists first laid the foundation for the armed forces of the People's Republic of Poland. Comrade Bierut's concern and that of the Central Committee of the Party, in the past and present, are closely related to the development path of our army.
    The Polish People's Army has experienced commanders who have been tempered in the struggle against fascism and have close ties with the people. Polish Minister of National Defense Marshal Rokossovsky is an outstanding example of the patriotism and internationalism, courage and heroism of Polish soldiers. Rokossovsky—the son of Warsaw workers, is a commander of the genius Stalin military school, a brave general in the battles near Moscow, Stalingrad, and Kursk, and the liberator of Warsaw, Prague, Gdańsk, and the western coastal lands of our country. The Polish army, led by the glorious Marshal Rokossovsky, relies on advanced Stalinist military science and accumulates its strength. This military science is the only reliable science of victory in the fight against Hitler's fascists and Japanese imperialism. It is this science that guaranteed the victory of our army on the road from Lenin through Warsaw, Pomorze, Gdynia, Gdańsk to Berlin. The foundation of the achievements of the Polish People's Army is the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries, as well as the great achievements of our socialist construction.
    Our powerful socialist industry is developing day by day, socialist construction, such as the construction of new socialist cities such as Nowa Huta, is growing, the Polish capital Warsaw is growing, metallurgical factories and textile factories are growing, and new automobile and tractor factories have been built. Agriculture and collective farms and state-owned farms are developing, and culture is also developing.
    The whole Polish people solemnly celebrate Polish Army Day, which is a symbol of the unbreakable fraternal alliance between the Polish People's Army in terms of weapons and ideology and the bastion of world peace—the ever-victorious Soviet Army. The strength and world-class technological equipment of the Soviet Army cause fear among the imperialists and hinder their mad plans to launch a new world war.
    Today, the Polish soldiers express their infinite loyalty to the Polish people and their leadership, the Polish United Workers' Party, and President Bierut, the beloved leader of the Polish people.
    Today, the soldiers of the Polish People's Army express their love for the Soviet people, the invincible Soviet Army, and Marshal Stalin, the teacher of all progressive mankind.
    Today, Polish soldiers express their respect for the Chinese people and their heroic People's Liberation Army—an important factor in defending peace in the Far East—and for the great military strategist Chairman Mao Zedong.
    On its own festival, the Polish People's Army sincerely extends warm warrior salutations and fraternal congratulations to the soldiers of the ever-victorious Soviet Army, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the people's democratic countries. It extends fraternal respect to the heroic soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who are victoriously fighting the American aggressors and their puppet countries.
    Polish soldiers know that they are soldiers of the great army of peace and progress. They know that the increase in their ideological awareness and combat skills is not only the growth of the defense power of their beloved motherland, the People's Republic of Poland, but also the growth of the power of the peaceful ranks of hundreds of millions of people led by the strong Soviet Union, which is building communism, and the great Stalin, the leader of all progressive mankind.

    十月十二日——波兰建军节
    波兰　孟纳德
    今天是一九四三年十月十二日在白俄罗斯社会主义共和国列宁诺地方发生历史性战斗的周年纪念日，波兰人民共和国的劳动人民隆重地来纪念自己军队的节日。
    在兄弟的苏联国土的列宁诺附近和苏维埃国家的军队并肩作战，是波兰人民新的武装力量的首次战斗。这次战斗成为决定我们军队威力的一切特性的象征。
    我们的军队现在具有完成波兰人民，我们英勇的工人阶级，我国政府和工人阶级的革命党——波兰统一工人党所给它的一切任务的能力。
    在列宁诺附近的战役中，波兰士兵去攻击法西斯阵地，为的是争取本国劳动人民群众的社会解放及民族解放。这是以争取解放人民的伟大斗士唐吉武斯·克斯久斯柯命名的第一师的士兵。这些士兵是依照波兰共产党员的建议所组织的队伍的一部分。这些波兰共产党员在我国被希特勒德国侵占之后，和成千的其他波兰人一起在苏联境内受到殷勤的招待。我们第一师的士兵受到了国际主义及无产阶级的爱国主义精神的教育。他们是在兄弟的苏联境内，在布尔什维克党、苏联军队和伟大的斯大林的关切抚育及全面帮助之下组织起来的。这支远离祖国为“争取你我自由”而流血的军队，证明了波兰人民和把波兰自希特勒侵略者及其本国剥削者羁绊下解放出来的苏联人民的永久友谊。和人民密切联系、为了人民和仅仅为人民的利益而从事忘我的斗争；在新型军队——苏联军队的帮助、友爱和示范之下，由工人阶级领导的波兰人民军——我们祖国的武装力量的主要特征。因此列宁诺附近战斗的传统对我们的军队和我国劳动人民是特别珍贵和亲切的，因此这一天成为波兰人民共和国军队的节日。
    波兰人民军的思想面貌，就是工人和劳动农民的思想面貌。这一点也就确定了它的阶级性。波兰军队是新型的军队，在军队里每一个士兵都深深地知道：他们是在企图掀起新世界大战的美帝国主义的野蛮阴谋面前，保卫着劳动人民的自由。
    波兰人民军的阶级性是与它的民族性密切联系着的。我们军队的士兵深深怀念于波兰人民的进步传统，现在波兰人民共和国军队的全体成员就是在这种传统中接受教育。工人阶级的政党是波兰人民军的组织者和教育者。波兰共产党党员们是在苏联的波兰第一军团的组织者，他们在一部分解放了的波兰国土上已组织了第二个军团。由于波兰统一工人党的领导，波兰军队成为一支士兵及指挥员具有高度的政治思想与战斗知识水平的不可动摇的团结一致的军队。
    波兰人民军队的士兵在和希特勒强盗战斗的过程中，在自己的历史上记载了许多的卓越战绩。从列宁诺到柏林是我们军队的战斗路程。这一条道路是和伟大的不可战胜的苏联军队的英雄士兵携手走过的。波兰军队的士兵深深尊敬并热爱波兰人民的领导者贝鲁特总统。贝鲁特同志是波兰共产党的领袖。波兰共产党员首先奠定了波兰人民共和国的武装力量的基础。贝鲁特同志与党中央委员会的关怀，在过去和现在，都是和我们军队发展的道路密切关联的。
    波兰人民军队具有在与法西斯主义斗争中受过锻炼的和人民有密切联系的有经验的指挥干部。波兰国防部长罗科索夫斯基元帅是波兰士兵的爱国主义与国际主义、果敢英勇的卓越榜样，罗科索夫斯基——华沙工人的儿子是天才的斯大林军事学校的指挥员，莫斯科、斯大林格勒、库尔斯克附近战役的勇将，华沙、布拉格、革但斯克及我国西部沿海土地的解放者。光荣的元帅罗科索夫斯基所统率的波兰军队以先进的斯大林军事科学为依据，积蓄着自己的力量，这种军事科学在和希特勒法西斯主义者和日本帝国主义的战斗中是唯一可靠的致胜科学。就是这种科学保证了我们的军队在从列宁诺通过华沙、波摩尔斯基、格顿、革但斯克到柏林的道路上的胜利。波兰人民军队成就的基础是苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的兄弟般的援助以及我国社会主义建设的伟大成就。
    我们的强大的社会主义的工业一天天发展着，社会主义的建设，如新的社会主义城市诺伐·胡塔等城市的建设正在成长中，波兰的首都华沙正在成长中，冶金工厂、纺织工厂正在成长中，另外建设了新的汽车和拖拉机工厂，农业与集体农场、国营农场正在发展，文化也正在发展中。
    全波兰人民隆重庆祝波兰建军节，是波兰人民军在武器方面和思想方面与世界和平堡垒——常胜的苏军的不可分割的兄弟联盟的象征，苏军的力量和世界第一流的技术装备引起帝国主义的恐惧，阻碍它们发动新世界大战的疯狂计划。
    今天波兰的战士们表示自己对于波兰人民及其领导力量波兰统一工人党和波兰人民敬爱的领袖贝鲁特总统的无限忠诚。
    今天波兰人民军队的战士表示自己对于苏联人民，对百战百胜的苏联军队和全体进步人类的导师斯大林大元帅的爱戴。
    今天波兰战士表示自己对于中国人民及其英勇的人民解放军——保卫远东和平的重要因素，和对于伟大的军事家毛泽东主席的尊敬。
    波兰人民军在自己的节日诚挚地向常胜的苏联军队、中国人民解放军战士以及各人民民主国家的战士致热烈的战士的敬礼与兄弟的祝贺，向与美国侵略者及其仆从国胜利作战的朝鲜人民军的英勇士兵及中国人民志愿军致以兄弟的敬意。
    波兰战士知道他们是和平与进步大军的士兵，他们知道，他们的思想觉悟和战斗技艺的增进，不仅是他们亲爱祖国波兰人民共和国的国防力量的增长，而且也是正在建设共产主义的强国苏联及全体进步人类领袖伟大的斯大林所领导的亿万人民和平队伍力量的增长。
