    On October 1st, the great Chinese people will warmly celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. They, along with the working people of all countries around the world, are watching with pride and joy the tremendous achievements they have made in building a people's democratic China under the long-tested leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong.
    The great Russian October Socialist Revolution shook the foundation of imperialism in colonial and semi-colonial countries. Under its influence, the Chinese national liberation movement developed to a new and higher level. The Soviet Union's defeat of Hitler's Germany and militarist Japan in World War II, and the rise of the international democratic anti-imperialist camp – these were important factors contributing to the victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution. The Chinese people have established an unbreakable alliance and friendship with the Soviet Union and all countries in the democratic anti-imperialist camp and are victoriously building their independent, peace-loving democratic nation.
    Three years is a relatively short period of time. But in this period, what truly astonishing changes have taken place in the lives of the Chinese people! Because the anti-feudal and anti-imperialist revolution achieved victory – the greatest international event since the October Revolution of 1917 and the victory over Fascism in 1945 – the Chinese people, for the first time in their history, united the previously divided territory and united many nationalities into a friendly family. The liberated Chinese people have also achieved brilliant successes in consolidating the new social system and state system. In building a new life, implementing great social and economic reforms, and industrializing and developing agriculture, the Chinese people have obtained, and continue to obtain, the selfless and fraternal assistance of the people of the Soviet Union. On the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship Alliance and Assistance on February 14, 1950, Comrade Mao Zedong sent a telegram to Comrade Stalin saying: "We thank the Soviet government and people for their sincere and generous assistance to the Chinese government and people in the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and related agreements over the past two years. This assistance has greatly helped the recovery and development of the new China's economy and the consolidation of the country." On September 2, 1952, the seventh anniversary of the victory over Japanese imperialism, Comrade Stalin sent a telegram to Comrade Mao Zedong saying: “The great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China is a reliable guarantee against new threats of aggression and a strong bulwark of peace in the Far East and throughout the world.” The brilliant achievements of the recent negotiations between the Soviet government and the delegation of the People's Republic of China once again powerfully demonstrated the unbreakable alliance and friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples. The Sino-Soviet announcement on the Chinese Changchun Railway stipulates that the Soviet government will transfer all rights to jointly manage the Chinese Changchun Railway and all property belonging to the railway to the government of the People's Republic of China free of charge, to be fully owned by it, and its realization shall not be later than December 31, 1952. This announcement once again proves the vitality of the great friendship between the two great peoples. Another proof is the Sino-Soviet agreement of September 15, 1952, on extending the term of joint use of the Chinese naval base of Lushunkou until the conclusion of peace treaties between the People's Republic of China and Japan and the Soviet Union and Japan. More than two years ago, with the crazy ambition to covet world hegemony, the American aggressors launched a war of aggression against Korea and occupied China's Taiwan Island, attempting to restore their lost position in Asia and enslave the Chinese and Korean peoples once again. But because the Korean and Chinese peoples waged a heroic and selfless battle, the heinous conspiracies of the American imperialists and their international bandit henchmen suffered a shameful defeat. They have not been able to stop the great economic and cultural construction of the People's China!
    The results of the national economic and cultural construction carried out by the People's Republic of China in the past three years once again prove a truth: people who have been led by the great October Socialist Revolution onto the path of struggle for democracy and socialism, after breaking free from social and colonial shackles, are performing miracles of creative, initiative, and heroic labor achievements, and are gaining unprecedented achievements in building a new life. In the three years since its founding, the People's Republic of China has more than doubled its industrial output and increased its total agricultural output value by 50 percent. During the same period, the output of steel and machinery increased seven or eight times, the output of coal and electricity doubled, and the average output of 35 major industrial products reached 126 percent of the highest pre-war level. Labor productivity increased by 88 percent. People's China has discovered a source of accumulated funds unprecedented in Chinese history, which makes it possible to allocate the majority of budgetary expenditures to economic and cultural construction in 1952. In the Chinese economy, the socialist state-owned economic component now plays a decisive role. The state controls 80 percent of heavy industry and about 40 percent of light industry, the entire railway network, and nearly 60 percent of shipping. More than 90 percent of deposits, loans, and bonds are handled by state banks. Profound changes have also taken place in China's agriculture. The broad masses of the people have been involved in the great land reform movement. To date, land reform has been implemented in areas with a population of 428 million. This winter and next spring, land reform will be completed throughout China, with the exception of some ethnic minority areas. Land reform abolished the feudal exploitation system, eliminated the landlord class, thereby eliminating the main base of reactionary forces and the main pillar of foreign imperialists. Rural productive forces have been liberated, and conditions for national industrialization have been created. In the past three years, China's total grain output has increased by more than 35 percent, and China has not only become a country that can be self-sufficient in grain, but it can also export grain. During this period, cotton production nearly doubled, and cotton production is now sufficient to meet domestic needs. Agriculture is supplying a rapidly developing domestic industry with increasing amounts of raw materials, while consuming increasing quantities of manufactured goods and meeting the growing domestic need for food. The material and cultural standards of the Chinese people are rising daily. In three years, the average wages of enterprise workers increased by 60 to 120 percent, and the income of farmers increased by one or two times. By the end of 1951, more than 2.2 million unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals had found jobs. Large-scale cultural development and housing construction are underway; public health is expanding, and the country's social security and insurance system has been implemented.
    The People's Republic of China has successfully completed the stage of restoring the national economy and has laid a solid foundation for further large-scale and planned economic development in order to transform China from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. All these victories were achieved due to the participation of the broadest masses in the patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the suppression of the remnants of domestic counter-revolutionaries, the implementation of land reform, and mass movements such as increasing production and practicing economy. These victories were achieved after a tenacious struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence. In the process of struggle and creative labor, the worker-peasant alliance has become stronger and more consolidated.
    Guiding the Chinese people forward is Marxism-Leninism, which was creatively applied to the practice of the Chinese revolution by the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong.
    The victories achieved by the People's Republic of China prove the tremendous strength of the Chinese people. The Chinese people, who were previously oppressed by reactionaries and foreign colonialists, have now risen up to carry out unprecedented creative work. These victories prove the invincible inherent strength of the new system and the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which is firmly based on Marxism-Leninism. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people, closely united around the Chinese Communist Party and their leader Mao Zedong, will surely be able to eliminate enemies at home and abroad, overcome all difficulties, build a prosperous country, and move towards the road of socialism.
    The Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries of the world extend sincere and fraternal congratulations to the great Chinese people for the great victories they have achieved in the process of building a people's democratic China!

    中华人民共和国成立三周年
    ——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”报社论
    十月一日，伟大的中国人民将热烈地庆祝中华人民共和国成立三周年。他们以及全世界各国的劳动人民，都以骄傲和愉快的心情，注视着他们在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的久经考验的领导下，在建设人民民主中国的工作中获得的巨大成就。
    伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命，动摇了帝国主义在殖民地国家和附属国中的基础。在它的影响下，中国民族解放运动发展到了新的、更高的水平。苏联在第二次世界大战中把希特勒德国和军国主义的日本打垮，国际民主反帝阵营的兴起——这些都是促成中国人民民主革命胜利的重要因素。中国人民与苏联及民主反帝阵营中的各国建立了牢不可破的同盟和友谊，正在胜利地建设他们独立的、爱好和平的民主国家。
    三年的时间是一个相对短促的时间。但是在这段时间中，中国人民的生活却发生了多么真正惊人的变化！由于反封建、反帝国主义的革命取得了胜利——这是一九一七年十月革命和一九四五年战胜法西斯主义的胜利以来发生的最大的国际事件，中国人民在它的历史上第一次把以往的四分五裂的国土统一起来，并把许多民族团结成一个友爱的大家庭。解放了的中国人民在巩固新的社会制度和国家制度方面也获得了辉煌的成就。中国人民在建设新生活、实行伟大的社会—经济改革、使国家工业化和发展农业的过程中，取得了并继续取得苏联人民的无私的兄弟般的援助。在一九五○年二月十四日签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约的二周年之际，毛泽东同志曾致电斯大林同志说：“我们感谢两年来苏联政府和人民依照中苏友好同盟互助条约及其有关各协定的精神，给予中国政府和人民热诚的、慷慨的援助，这些援助大大帮助了新中国经济的恢复和发展及国家的巩固。”斯大林同志在一九五二年九月二日，即在战胜日本帝国主义七周年时，曾致电毛泽东同志说：“苏联和中华人民共和国之间的伟大友谊是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是远东及全世界和平的坚强堡垒。”最近苏联政府与中华人民共和国政府代表团之间的谈判所得到的辉煌成就，再一次有力地表现了苏联人民与中国人民之间的牢不可破的同盟和友谊。中苏关于中国长春铁路的公告规定：苏联政府将共同管理中国长春铁路的一切权利以及属于该路的全部财产无偿地移交中华人民共和国政府完全归其所有，其实现不得迟于一九五二年十二月三十一日。这个公告再一次证明了伟大的两国人民之间的伟大友谊的活力。另一个证明是一九五二年九月十五日关于将共同使用中国海军根据地旅顺口的期限延长到中华人民共和国与日本以及苏联与日本缔结和约时为止的中苏协议。在两年多以前，美国侵略者怀着觊觎世界霸权的疯狂野心，对朝鲜发动了侵略战争，并侵占了中国的台湾岛，企图借此恢复他们在亚洲失去的地位，再度奴役中国人民和朝鲜人民。但是由于朝鲜人民和中国人民进行了英勇的忘我的战斗，美帝国主义者和他们的国际匪帮的喽罗们的罪恶阴谋遭受了可耻的失败。他们并没有能够阻挡住人民中国的伟大的经济建设与文化建设！
    中华人民共和国三年来所进行的国家经济与文化建设的结果，又一次证明了一个真理：被伟大的十月社会主义革命引上争取民主与社会主义的斗争这一轨道的人民，在摆脱了社会的和殖民地的枷锁以后，正在做出创造、主动和英勇劳动业绩的奇迹，正在建设新生活方面获得前所未闻的成就。中华人民共和国在成立以来的三年中已使工业产量增加了一倍多，使农业生产总值增加了百分之五十。在同一期间，钢铁和机器的产量增加了七、八倍，煤和电力的产量增加了一倍，三十五种主要工业品的产量平均为战前最高水平的百分之一百二十六。劳动生产率提高了百分之八十八。人民中国发现了中国历史上前所未有的积累资金的源泉，这种源泉使有可能在一九五二年把预算开支中的大部分拨作经济与文化建设的经费。在中国经济中，社会主义性质的国营经济成分现在起着决定性的作用。国家控制了百分之八十的重工业和百分之四十左右的轻工业，整个铁路网和差不多百分之六十的航运。百分之九十以上的存款、贷款和债券都是由国家银行处理的。中国的农业也起了深刻的变化。广大的人民群众卷入了伟大的土地改革运动。迄今为止，有四亿二千八百万人口的地区已经实行了土地改革。在今年冬季和明年春季，除了一些少数民族地区以外，全中国各地将完成土地改革。土地改革废除了封建剥削制度，消灭了地主阶级，从而消灭了反动势力的主要基础和外国帝国主义者的主要支柱。农村的生产力获得了解放，国家工业化的条件具备了。在过去三年中，中国的粮食总产量增加了百分之三十五以上，中国不仅成为在粮食方面可以自给自足的国家，而且它还可以输出粮食。在这个时期中，棉花产量增加了将近两倍，棉花的生产已足以适应国内的需要。农业正以愈来愈多的原料供应迅速发展的国内工业，同时消费着数量日益增加的制成品，并适应国内在粮食方面的日益增长的需要。中国人民的物质与文化水平日益提高。在三年中，企业工人的平均工资增加了百分之六十至一百二十，农民的收入则增加了一两倍以上。到一九五一年年底，二百二十多万失业工人和失业知识分子找到了职业。大规模发展文化和修建房屋的工作正在进行中；公共卫生事业正在扩展着，国家的社会安全和保险制度已经实施了。
    中华人民共和国已经胜利地完成了恢复国民经济的阶段，并为进一步大规模的和有计划的经济的发展奠定了稳固的基础，以便使中国从一个落后的农业国变成进步的工业国。所有这些胜利都是由于最广泛的群众参加了抗美援朝的爱国运动、镇压国内反革命分子的残余、实行土地改革以及增产节约等群众运动而获得的。这些胜利是经过反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义，反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报等顽强的斗争之后获得的。在斗争的过程和创造性的劳动中间，工农联盟变得更加强大而巩固了。
    引导中国人民前进的，是被中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东创造性地应用在中国革命实践中的马克思主义—列宁主义。
    中华人民共和国获得的胜利证明了中国人民的巨大力量。中国人民以前受反动派与外国殖民者的压迫，现在已奋起进行历史上空前的创造性工作。这些胜利证明了新制度不可战胜的内在力量，证明了以马克思主义—列宁主义为稳固基础的中国共产党的正确领导。紧密地团结在中国共产党与他们的领袖毛泽东周围的数亿中国人民，一定能够消灭国内外的敌人，克服一切困难、建设一个富强的国家，向着社会主义的道路迈进。
    全世界各国的共产党和工人党，向在建设人民民主中国过程中获得巨大胜利的伟大的中国人民，致以真挚的、兄弟般的祝贺！（新华社三十日据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特讯）
