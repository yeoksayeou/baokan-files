    Workers, collective farmers, and Soviet intellectuals are greeting the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on convening the 19th Party Congress and the documents of the Party Congress with great enthusiasm. The working people of our motherland are studying the draft directives of the 19th Party Congress on the Fifth Five-Year Plan, and they are celebrating with justifiable pride the historic victories achieved under the leadership of the great Communist Party, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin.

    In our country, the growth of the national economy is accompanied by the rise of the material well-being and cultural level of the working people. Thanks to the care of the Communist Party, during the pre-war Stalinist Five-Year Plans, a cultural revolution was realized in the Soviet Union, Soviet intellectuals were cultivated, and a Soviet socialist culture, inspired by the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism, flourished.

    Comrade Stalin said in his report to the 18th Party Congress: “From the perspective of the people’s cultural development, the reporting period is truly a period of cultural revolution. The implementation of universal elementary compulsory education in the languages of the various Soviet nationalities, the increase in the number of schools and students at all levels, the increase in the number of specialists graduating from higher schools, and the cultivation and consolidation of a new Soviet intelligentsia – this is the general picture of the rise in the people's cultural level.”

    The 18th Party Congress particularly emphasized the tasks of the communist education of the working people and the further development of Soviet culture. Comrade Stalin put forward the historic task of making all workers and peasants cultured and educated.

    During the period after the 18th Party Congress, great success has been achieved in completing the tasks put forward by Comrade Stalin. In the Soviet Union, universal seven-year education has been realized, and the number of schools, specialized schools, institutions of higher learning, scientific research institutions, and cultural and educational institutions is constantly growing. In 1951, the number of people receiving education in the Soviet Union, including all kinds of education, was 57 million. Last year, 1,356,000 university students were studying in institutions of higher learning.

    The draft directives of the 19th Party Congress on the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union in 1951-1955 stipulate even greater scales for cultural construction.

    The draft directives state: "By the end of the fifth year, to completely transform seven-year education into universal secondary education (ten-year education) in the capitals of the republics, cities directly under the republics, and large industrial centers of the states and border regions. To prepare conditions for the implementation of universal secondary education (ten-year education) in other cities and rural areas during the next five-year period."

    In order to complete this task, the draft Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates an increase of approximately 70 percent in the establishment of urban and rural schools compared to the previous five-year plan period, and to expand the training of teachers.

    The tasks of communist construction require further enhancing the socialist educational significance of general education schools and ensuring that middle school graduates have the conditions to freely choose their occupations. The draft Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates the beginning of technical education in middle schools and taking the necessary measures for the gradual transition to universal technical education.

    The new Five-Year Plan also stipulates the further development of higher education. The number of various specialists graduating from higher and secondary specialized schools will increase by approximately 30-35 percent within five years, and the number of various specialists trained for the most important industrial, construction, and agricultural sectors will approximately double. The work of training scientific research personnel and educational research personnel will approximately double during the five-year period.

    In the Soviet Union, not only are all young people studying, but also millions of adult workers and peasants are studying. Soviet intellectuals are tirelessly improving their knowledge. In our country, the most favorable conditions have been created for the cultural growth of all working people. The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates a great expansion of the school network for adult residents.

    The comprehensive development of national education and the training of cadres for secondary specialized schools and institutions of higher learning, the further growth of cultural and educational institutions and publications, guarantees a new and powerful rise in the cultural and technical level of the Soviet people.

    The socialist system has opened up enormous possibilities for the development of advanced science. The Communist Party, the Soviet government, and Comrade Stalin constantly care about the prosperity of our science. In his historic speech at the voters' meeting on February 9, 1946, Comrade Stalin pointed out the necessity of broadly building various scientific research institutes and put forward the task of not only catching up with but also surpassing the achievements of foreign science in the near future.

    The network of scientific research institutions in 1951 exceeded that of the pre-war period by 50 percent, and the number of workers in scientific research institutions almost doubled. Soviet scientists are successfully devoting themselves to completing the tasks put forward by Comrade Stalin. In many fields of knowledge, Soviet scientists occupy the first place in the development of world science. The draft directives of the Fifth Five-Year Plan puts forward the following tasks:

    "To improve the work of scientific research institutes and the scientific work of institutions of higher learning, to fully utilize the strength of science to solve the major problems in the development of the national economy, to promote the experience of advanced workers, and to ensure the universal and practical application of scientific inventions. To do everything possible to assist scientists in their work on the theoretical problems of all aspects of knowledge, and to strengthen the links between science and industry."

    Soviet scientists are realizing these important tasks, and they will achieve new and outstanding achievements in the Fifth Five-Year Plan, and will glorify our motherland with scientific creations and inventions.

    Our motherland is a multi-ethnic socialist country. As a result of the unwavering implementation of the Leninist-Stalinist national policy, the culture of all our socialist nations are developing and flourishing smoothly. The Soviet culture of socialist content and national form instills in the masses the noble ideas of friendship between all nationalities, the vigorous ideas of Soviet patriotism and proletarian internationalism. It educates the Soviet people in the spirit of love for the socialist motherland and loyalty to the great cause of the Leninist-Stalinist Party.

    Soviet literature and art play an important role in the development of Soviet culture and in the communist education of the working people. Our writers and artists have created literary and artistic works that truthfully reflect the high moral qualities of the Soviet people, their lives, and their struggle to further enhance the power of the motherland, to strive for peace and friendship between all nationalities, and for the happiness of the people of the world. The resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and Comrade Stalin's instructions on ideological issues inspire Soviet writers and artists to achieve new successes in their creative work.

    The Fifth Five-Year Plan is a plan for peaceful economic and cultural construction. Before the eyes of the whole world, it demonstrates the great vitality of socialism and the fundamental superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. In capitalist countries, there is militarization and arms race, massive unemployment, and the impoverishment of the working people. In capitalist countries, the ruling class deprives millions of working people of the possibility of enjoying the happiness of science and culture. They attempt to turn science into a more cruel tool for the exploitation of the working people and a tool for destroying mankind.

    In the Soviet Union, there is the constant rise of the peaceful economy, the continuous growth of the material well-being and cultural level of the working people, and the flourishing of the culture of socialist content and national form of the various Soviet nationalities.

    Workers, collective farmers, and Soviet intellectuals are closely united around the Communist Party, around the leader and teacher Comrade Stalin, and they are greeting the 19th Party Congress with new achievements in all sectors of economic and cultural construction. The Communist Party's grand plan inspires the Soviet people to participate in the struggle for a new and powerful rise in the economy, for the further prosperity of culture, and for the victory of communism.

    争取苏维埃文化的进一步繁荣
    ——苏联真理报九月八日社论
    工人、集体农民和苏维埃知识分子以高度的热情迎接联共（布）中央委员会关于召开第十九次代表大会的决议和党的代表大会的文件。我们祖国的劳动人民研究着党的第十九次代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示草案，他们带着合乎情理的自豪心庆祝在伟大的共产党的领导下，在斯大林同志的领导下所获得的历史性胜利。
    在我国，国民经济的增长伴随着劳动人民的物质幸福和文化水平的高涨。由于共产党的关怀，在战前的几个斯大林五年计划期内，在苏联实现了文化革命，培养出了苏维埃的知识分子，为马克思主义—列宁主义伟大思想所鼓舞的苏维埃社会主义文化繁荣起来了。
    斯大林同志在党的第十八次代表大会的报告中说过：“从人民底文化发展方面看来，报告时期真正是文化革命底时期。普通初级义务教育制用苏联各民族语言的实现，各级学校与学生数目的增加，毕业于高级学校的专门家数目的增加，新的苏维埃的智识界的养成和巩固，——这就是人民文化程度高涨底一般情景。”
    党的第十八次代表大会特别强调了劳动人民的共产主义教育和进一步发展苏维埃文化的任务。斯大林同志提出了历史性的任务——使所有的工人和农民都成为有文化的和有教养的。
    在共产党的第十八次代表大会后的这个期间，在完成斯大林同志所提出的任务方面达到了巨大的成功，在苏联，普及的七年制教育实现了，学校、专科学校、高等学校、科学研究机关和文化教育机关的数目在不断地增长着。一九五一年在苏联受教育的人数，包括受各种教育的，有五千七百万。去年有一百三十五万六千个大学生在高等学校里学习。
    党的第十九次代表大会关于一九五一年—一九五五年苏联发展第五个五年计划的指示草案规定了文化建设的更其巨大的规模。
    指示草案中说：“到第五年年底，把各共和国首都、共和国直辖市、各州的和边疆区的大工业中心的七年制教育完全改为普及中等教育（十年制教育）。为下一个五年期间，在其他的城市和农村中实行普及中等教育（十年制教育）准备条件。”
    为了完成这个任务，第五个五年计划草案规定在设立城市和农村的学校方面，要比上一个五年计划期间约增加百分之七十，并扩大对教师的培养。
    共产主义建设的任务要求进一步提高一般教育学校的社会主义教育意义，并保证中学毕业学生有条件自由选择职业。第五个五年计划草案规定开始在中学校内实行技术教育，并为逐渐过渡到普遍实行技术教育而采取必要的措施。
    在新的五年计划中也规定高等教育的进一步发展。高等和中等专业学校毕业出来的各种专家在五年之内约增加百分之三十—三十五，为最重要的工业部门、建设部门和农业部门培养出的各种专家，约增加到二倍。训练科学研究人员和教育研究人员的工作在五年期间约增加到两倍。
    在苏联这个国家里，不仅所有的青年在学习，而且千百万的成年工人和农民也都在学习。苏维埃知识分子不倦地提高自己的知识。在我国，为一切劳动人民的文化增长创造了最有利的条件。在第五个五年计划中规定把成年居民的学校网大大地扩大。
    国民教育的全面发展和中等专业学校和高等学校的干部的培养，文化教育机关和刊物的进一步增长，保证了苏联人民文化—技术水平的新的强有力的高涨。
    社会主义的制度开辟了发展先进科学的巨大可能性。共产党、苏联政府、斯大林同志经常地关怀我们科学的繁荣。一九四六年二月九日，斯大林同志在选民大会上的历史性的演说中，指出了广泛建设各种科学研究院的必要性，并提出了在最近期间不仅赶上、而且超过国外科学的成就的任务。
    科学研究机关网在一九五一年就超过了战前的百分之五十，科学研究机关的工作者的数目几乎增加到二倍。苏联的科学家成功地致力于完成斯大林同志所提出来的任务。在许多知识部门，苏联科学家在世界科学发展方面都占了第一位。在第五个五年计划的指示草案中提出了下面的任务。
    “改进科学研究所的工作和高等教育机关的科学工作，以充分利用科学的力量来解决国民经济发展中的主要问题、推广先进工人的经验，保证普遍地、实际地应用科学发明。尽力协助科学家进行关于各方面知识的理论问题的工作，加强科学和工业之间的联系。”
    苏联科学家实现着这些重大的任务，他们在第五个五年计划中将达到新的卓越的成就，将用科学的创造与发明使我们祖国增光。
    我们的祖国是一个多民族的社会主义国家。由于始终不渝地实现列宁—斯大林的民族政策的结果，我们的一切社会主义的民族的文化都在顺利地发展和繁荣着。社会主义内容和民族形式的苏维埃文化，使群众具有高尚的各民族友谊的思想、蓬勃的苏维埃爱国主义和无产阶级的国际主义的思想。它以对社会主义祖国的爱、对列宁—斯大林党的伟大事业的忠诚的精神教育苏联人。
    在苏维埃文化的发展中，在劳动人民的共产主义教育事业中，苏联文学和艺术起着重要的作用。我们的文学家和艺术家创作了文学和艺术作品，这些作品真实地反映出苏联人的高度道德品质，反映出他们的生活和争取进一步提高祖国威力、争取各民族之间的和平与友谊、争取全世界人民幸福的斗争。联共（布）中央委员会的决议，斯大林同志关于思想问题的指示，鼓舞着苏联文学家和艺术工作者在创作工作中获得新成就。
    第五个五年计划是和平经济和文化建设的计划。在全世界的面前，它表现出社会主义的伟大生命力和社会主义制度对于资本主义制度的根本的优越性。在资本主义国家里是军国主义化和军备竞争，大量的失业，劳动人民的贫困。在资本主义国家里，统治阶级剥夺了千百万劳动人民享受科学和文化的幸福的可能，他们企图把科学变成对劳动人民的更为残忍的剥削工具，变成毁灭人类的工具。
    在苏联，则是和平经济的不断高涨，劳动人民物质幸福和文化水平的不断的增长、苏联各民族的社会主义内容和民族形式的文化的繁荣。
    工人、集体农民、苏联知识分子紧密地团结在共产党、团结在领袖和导师斯大林同志的周围，他们以经济和文化建设的各部门的新成就来迎接第十九次代表大会。共产党的雄伟的计划鼓舞着苏联人参加争取经济的新的强有力的高涨、争取文化的进一步繁荣和争取共产主义胜利的斗争。
