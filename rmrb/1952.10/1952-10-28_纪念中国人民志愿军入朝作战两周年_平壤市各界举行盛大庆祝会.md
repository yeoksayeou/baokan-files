Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 27th: Pyongyang held a grand celebration on the 24th to commemorate the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea to fight.

Those who attended the celebration included: Hong Ki-ju, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea; Kim Tal-hyun and Lee Young, Vice Chairmen of the Supreme People's Assembly; Park Heon-yeong, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs; Choi Yong-geon, Minister of National Defense; Jang Shi-woo, Minister of Commerce; Choi Chang-ik, Minister of Finance; Baek Nam-un, Minister of Education; Kim Jeong-ju, Minister of Communications; Heo Jeong-suk, Minister of Culture and Propaganda; Park Chang-ok, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea; Jang Soon-myung, Chairman of the Inspection Committee; as well as heads of various democratic political parties and mass organizations in Korea, senior generals of the Korean People's Army, combat heroes, workers, farmers, women, youth, students, literary and art workers, journalists, and others from the Pyongyang area, totaling more than a thousand people.

Also invited to attend the conference were: Gan Yetao, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Korea; Ivanenko, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in Korea; and diplomatic envoys and embassy staff from various People's Democratic countries to Korea.

The Chinese People's Volunteers delegation, led by Chief Representative General Yang Dezhi, and the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, led by General Director Liu Jingfan, were also invited to attend the conference.

The presidium, led by Deputy Prime Minister Park Heon-yeong and General Yang Dezhi, entered the venue before the opening of the conference. At this moment, thunderous applause and cheers resounded throughout the venue, and women from Pyongyang presented flowers to the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

After Yoon Gong-heum, Chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and one of the chairmen of the conference presidium, announced the opening, all attendees stood up in unison and, amidst stormy applause, elected Marshal Stalin, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Premier Kim Il-sung as honorary presidium members of the conference.

Kim Jae-wook, Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, delivered a commemorative report at the conference. He said: It has been two years since the fraternal Chinese people dispatched the heroic People's Volunteers to the Korean battlefield to assist our Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War. In these two years, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have fought closely side by side, shattered the heinous aggression plans of the American armed interventionists, and inflicted irreparable and disastrous defeats on the enemy. The entire Korean people want to express their national gratitude to our benefactor—the great Chinese people and their guiding and leading force, the Chinese Communist Party, and the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong.

Kim Jae-wook then said: The active support of the freedom-loving people of the world for the Korean people and the solemn Resist America, Aid Korea movement of the 500 million Chinese people are unfolding more widely and powerfully day by day. Today, in every corner of China, mass movements to increase production and practice thrift are being widely carried out to support the Korean front. Chairman Mao Zedong said at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The great struggle to Resist America, Aid Korea is still continuing and must continue until the US government is willing to settle peacefully."

Kim Jae-wook pointed out: The US government does not accept our fair and reasonable plan on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war and has indefinitely adjourned the Panmunjom armistice negotiations. He said: The people of both Korea and China demand a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, but we will never fear the threats of the Anglo-American armed aggressors. The people of Korea and China have gained rich experience in fighting against the Anglo-American armed interventionists over the past two years. If the Anglo-American imperialists do not learn their lesson in Korea and dare to expand the war, it will undoubtedly lead to their own destruction.

He pointed out: The freedom-loving people of the world unanimously believe that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are righteous armed forces for maintaining the cause of world peace, and they are constantly giving us spiritual and material assistance. The heinous war of aggression against Korea waged by Anglo-American imperialism has increasingly isolated them in the world. The Asian and Pacific Peace Conference recently held in Beijing reflected the unanimous aspirations of 1.6 billion people, condemned the barbaric aggression of US imperialism against Korea, and expressed warm sympathy and support for the heroic struggle of our Korean people.

Kim Jae-wook concluded: Celebrating the second anniversary of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea to fight, we must further consolidate the friendship and solidarity between the people of Korea and China, which is forged in blood. Under the leadership of the glorious Workers' Party and our beloved leader General Kim Il-sung, the Korean people will surely achieve final victory.

After Kim Jae-wook's report, Kim Chang-joon, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, delivered a congratulatory speech. He warmly congratulated the great achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield and, on behalf of the Korean Fatherland Front, presented a silk banner to all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, which was accepted by General Yang Dezhi, Chief Representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation.

Next, General Yang Dezhi, Chief Representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation, delivered a speech amidst thunderous applause. He briefly introduced the tremendous achievements made by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the past two years on the Korean battlefield together with the Korean military and civilians. He expressed: All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers are determined to fight to the end to win the victorious end of the Korean War and the fair and reasonable resolution of the Korean issue.

Liu Jingfan, General Director of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, was also invited to deliver a speech. He warmly praised the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people's forces and the unbreakable fighting solidarity between China and Korea. Amidst thunderous applause, he presented a huge silk banner to the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on behalf of all the Chinese people. The banner was embroidered with "Long Live the Unbreakable Fighting Friendship between the Chinese and Korean Peoples." Deputy Prime Minister Park Heon-yeong accepted the banner on behalf of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The conference finally unanimously passed telegrams of greetings to Marshal Stalin, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Premier Kim Il-sung.

After the meeting, the Concert Troupe of the Korean People's Army and the Cultural Troupe of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers jointly performed celebratory programs.

    纪念中国人民志愿军入朝作战两周年
    平壤市各界举行盛大庆祝会
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】平壤市各界在二十四日举行盛大庆祝会，纪念中国人民志愿军入朝作战两周年。
    参加庆祝会的有：朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会副委员长洪箕畴，最高人民会议副议长金达铉、李英，内阁副首相兼外务相朴宪永，民族保卫相崔镛健，商业相张时雨，财政相崔昌益，教育相白南云，递信相金廷柱，文化宣传相许贞琡，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会书记朴昌玉，检查委员会委员长张顺明，以及朝鲜各民主政党和群众团体负责人、朝鲜人民军高级将领、战斗英雄、平壤地区的工人、农民、妇女、青年学生、文艺工作者、新闻工作者等共一千多人。
    应邀出席大会的还有：我国驻朝鲜大使馆代办甘野陶、苏联驻朝鲜大使馆参赞伊万年柯和各人民民主国家驻朝鲜使节及使馆人员。
    中国人民志愿军代表团在首席代表杨得志将军率领下、中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团在总团长刘景范率领下也应邀出席大会。
    由朴宪永副首相和杨得志将军为先导的主席团在大会开幕前进入会场。这时，全场响起了雷动的鼓掌声和欢呼声，平壤市的妇女们向中国人民志愿军代表献花。
    大会主席团主席之一、朝鲜劳动党平壤市委员会委员长尹公钦宣布开幕后，全体到会者一致起立，在暴风雨般的掌声中，选出斯大林大元帅、毛泽东主席、金日成首相为大会名誉主席团。
    朝鲜人民军总政治局长金载郁在大会上作了纪念报告。他说：兄弟般的中国人民派遣英勇的人民志愿军到朝鲜战场来援助我们朝鲜人民的祖国解放战争已经两年了。在这两年中，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一起紧密地并肩作战，粉碎了美国武装干涉者的凶恶侵略计划，使敌人遭到了无可挽回的惨败。全朝鲜人民要向我们的援助者——伟大的中国人民及其指导与领导力量中国共产党和中国人民领袖毛泽东主席，致以全民族的感谢。
    金载郁接着说：全世界爱好自由的人民对朝鲜人民的积极支持和中国五亿人民的庄严的抗美援朝运动，正在一天比一天更广泛地更强有力地展开着。今天在全中国的每个角落里，都在为了支持朝鲜前线而广泛地展开着群众性的增产节约运动。毛泽东主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上说：“抗美援朝的伟大斗争现在还在继续进行，并且必须继续进行到美国政府愿意和平解决的时候为止。”
    金载郁指出：美国政府不接受我方关于遣返战俘问题的公平合理方案，并使板门店停战谈判无限期休会。他说：朝中两国人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题，但是我们绝不畏惧美英武装侵略者的威胁，朝中两国人民二年来已取得了与美英武装干涉者进行斗争的丰富经验，如果美英帝国主义不接受它们在朝鲜的教训而竟敢扩大战争，那就是它们自取灭亡，这是无可置疑的。
    他指出：全世界爱好自由的人民，一致认为朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军是维护世界和平事业的正义的武装力量，他们不断地给予我们精神上和物质上的援助。美英帝国主义进行的罪恶的侵朝战争，已使它们在全世界日益孤立。最近在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议反映了十六亿人民的一致愿望，斥责了美帝国主义对朝鲜的野蛮侵略，表明了对我们朝鲜人民英勇斗争的热烈同情和支持。
    金载郁最后说：庆祝英雄的中国人民志愿军入朝作战两周年，我们要进一步巩固朝中人民以鲜血结成的友谊团结。朝鲜人民在光荣的劳动党和我们敬爱领袖金日成将军的领导下，必将取得最后胜利。
    金载郁报告毕，朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会书记局长金昌俊致祝词。他热烈祝贺中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上建立的伟大功勋，并代表朝鲜祖国战线向中国人民志愿军全体将士献赠锦旗一面，由中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表杨得志将军受旗。
    接着，中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表杨得志将军在雷动的掌声中发表演说。他扼要地介绍了中国人民志愿军两年来在朝鲜战场上和朝鲜军民一起所获得的巨大成就。他表示：中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员，决心为争取朝鲜战争的胜利结束、朝鲜问题的公平合理解决而奋斗到底。
    中国人民赴朝慰问团总团长刘景范也应邀发表演说。他热烈地赞扬中朝人民部队的伟大胜利和中朝两国牢不可破的战斗团结。在全场雷动般的掌声中，他代表全中国人民向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府赠送巨幅锦旗一面，锦旗上面绣着“中朝人民牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁”，朴宪永副首相代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府受旗。
    大会最后一致通过了给斯大林大元帅，毛泽东主席、金日成首相的致敬电。
    会后，由朝鲜人民军协奏团和中国人民志愿军某部文工团联合演出庆祝节目。
