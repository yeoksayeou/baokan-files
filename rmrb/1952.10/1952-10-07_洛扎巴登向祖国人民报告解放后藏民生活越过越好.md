To the Comrades of the Editorial Department,

To the Comrades of the Great Motherland: I am a Tibetan from Guoxu Village in Gyangze, Tibet. From the day I could walk, I herded horses for others; I don't know how many horses I drove to their deaths, and I didn't earn a single penny. Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has come and hired my horses to carry goods, and every time they have given me reasonable wages. When I have nothing to do in the winter, I rent my horses to the PLA. The silver I have accumulated bit by bit amounts to more than 300 taels. The horses are well-fed and fat, and my family's life is much better than before.

Now, when my family boils butter tea, we put more tea leaves in it, pour it into the筒子, and add more butter and salt to make it thick. When everyone picks up their tea, their hearts are warmed by the first sip. My eighty-year-old father always scolds us, saying, "Children, you should recite the Longevity Sutra several more times every day to bless Chairman Mao! We owe it to Chairman Mao that we can drink such good tea. Chairman Mao liberated us so that we can live such good lives. Before liberation, who could afford such good butter tea? I have lived such a long life, and I have only been able to drink it myself since liberation! In the past, people said that I lived a long life and suffered a lot. Now, with Chairman Mao, I have seen our family earn money by driving horses, and our life is getting better and better. I want to live to be a hundred years old, so I can see with my own eyes Tibet being built into a free and happy paradise year by year under the leadership of Chairman Mao!" Old people are always talkative. Which morning do my wife Balang and I not recite the Longevity Sutra to Chairman Mao ten times or more?

All the people of Gyangze and all of Tibet hate the imperialist aggression against us. Before liberation, there was an imperialist element—I heard he was American—who always glared when he walked on the streets of Gyangze. When people saw him, they had to stick out their tongues to show respect. I was driving two horses on the street, each carrying eighty or ninety catties of goods. How could I avoid people? He was wearing glasses, as if he was blind, and collided with a horse. He grabbed me and whipped me sixty or seventy times, and mumbled something I didn't understand. I was so angry! The people watching on the street were also angry for me. At that time, the PLA had not yet come, and everyone was angry but dared not say anything.

I heard that the PLA was coming soon. Those glaring imperialist guys don't know where they escaped to. And we, the people of Gyangze, who have suffered from imperialist oppression, are now walking with our heads held high.

One day, I was driving horses for several PLA soldiers. During the break, I saw them sitting together reading newspapers. I asked them, "What new and exciting things are in the newspaper?" They said, "The people of Inner Mongolia wrote a letter to the newspaper to report to the people of the whole country on the development of various constructions and their happy lives after the establishment of the autonomous region." After hearing this, I thought about entrusting someone to write a letter and publish it in the newspaper to report to the people of all ethnic groups in the great motherland: After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the lives of the people are getting better and better, and they are no longer subject to imperialist aggression. I have too many words in my heart, and the more I say, the longer it gets. To put it simply: We Tibetan people thank our savior Chairman Mao! Thank the Communist Party and the PLA! We pray that Chairman Mao's blessings are as vast as the sea and as deep as the mountains! We pray that the PLA will forever be stationed in Tibet to defend our country's territory! With highest respect!

Respectfully, Lozhaba Deng

    洛扎巴登向祖国人民报告解放后藏民生活越过越好
    编辑同志转
    伟大祖国的同胞们：我是西藏江孜郭须村的一个藏民。我从能跑路的一天起，就给人家赶马；也不知道赶死了多少匹马，一个钱也没有赚着。自从西藏和平解放后，解放军来了，雇我的马驮东西，没有一次不给我合理的脚价。我一冬天没有事的时候，就租马给解放军用。零星积蓄起来的银子就有三百多两。马既喂得肥肥的，家里的生活也比从前好多了。
    现在我们家熬酥油茶的时候，茶叶也放得多了，倒在筒子里，多加上些酥油盐巴打得浓浓的。大家端起茶来，茶一进口，心里暖和。我的八十多岁老爸爸就该教训我们了，他说：“孩子们每天该多念几遍长寿经，给毛主席祝福！咱们是托毛主席的福，才有这样的好茶喝。毛主席解放了我们，我们才能过这样的好日子。解放前，谁能有钱喝得起这么好的酥油茶？我活了这么大年纪，还是解放以后，才能亲口喝着的啦！往年人家都说我活的年纪大，多受了很多罪。现在有了毛主席，我亲眼看着我们家赶马赚钱，生活越过越好。我愿意活到一百岁，好亲眼看着我们西藏在毛主席领导下，一年一年的建设成为自由幸福的乐园！”年老的人，话总唠叨。哪一天清早，我和我的老婆巴朗不给毛主席念上十来遍长寿经？
    我们全江孜、全西藏人民，都痛恨帝国主义对我们的侵略。解放前，有个帝国主义分子——听说是美国的，他走在江孜街上，总是横眉竖眼的。大家看见他，都要伸出舌头表示敬礼。我赶着两匹马在街上走，马都驮了八、九十斤的货，那能躲得开人？他戴着眼镜，好像眼瞎了似的，和马撞上了。他捉住我，足足打了六、七十鞭子，还咕哩咕噜的不知道骂了我些什么。我真气极了！街上看的人也都替我生气。那个时候，解放军还没有来，大家干生气，不敢做声。
    听说解放军快要来了。那些横眉竖眼的帝国主义家伙们也不知道逃到那里去了。而我们受尽帝国主义压迫的江孜人民，今天昂着头走路了。
    有一天我给几个解放军赶马，在休息的时候我看见他们坐在一块看报纸。我问他们：报上有什么新奇的事情？他们说：“内蒙古的人民写信给报纸向全国人民报告他们成立自治区以后各项建设发展情况和他们的快乐生活。”我听了以后，心里就盘算着也想托人写封信，登在报上，向伟大祖国的各族人民报告：西藏和平解放后，人民生活越过越好，不再受帝国主义的侵略了。我心里的话太多，越说越长。简单地再说一句：我们西藏人民感谢我们的救星毛主席！感谢共产党、解放军！我们祈祷毛主席的福寿像大海一般的广大，像大山一样的深厚！我们祈祷解放军永远地驻在西藏，保卫我们祖国的领土！谨致崇高的敬礼！  洛扎巴登敬上
