Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 11th: The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) continued its session on the 10th. The morning session was presided over by Bagirov. The Congress began discussing the fourth item on the agenda: Amendments to the Charter of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). The reporter was N.S. Khrushchev, Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU (B). The Congress welcomed Khrushchev with stormy and prolonged applause.

Khrushchev said that our country was able to achieve victory because the Party tirelessly carried out tremendous organizational work among the masses to realize Stalin's brilliant plan. The Party's organizational work concentrated all the efforts of the Soviet people on a common goal: to fight to defeat the enemy during the difficult war years, to rapidly restore the national economy and further develop it after the war, and to successfully realize the plans for communist construction.

Khrushchev said that now, when the Soviet people are fighting with renewed vigor to realize the great plan of building a communist society, the guiding and organizing role of the Communist Party and the significance of its organizational and ideological education work are constantly increasing. The tasks before us place higher demands on Party organizations and all Party members, and these demands must be taken into account in Party work and Party building.

Khrushchev continued, saying that our Party constantly improves its working methods and changes the forms of Party building according to the environment and new tasks. Since the closing of the 18th Party Congress, our Party has gained new experience in Party building, and this experience is reflected in the Party Charter. At the same time, it must also be noted that some parts of the Party Charter adopted at the last Congress are already outdated. Therefore, the Party Charter must be supplemented and revised.

Khrushchev then explained the specific amendments and supplements, which had been discussed by the entire Party before the opening of the Congress and are now submitted by the Central Committee of the CPSU (B) for approval by the 19th Congress.

Khrushchev then said that this Party Charter, which the Congress is about to pass, is a document with great organizational and mobilizing power. It is an important means for strengthening the ideological education of Party members, Party and government cadres in the spirit of Leninism, and an important means for further expanding inner-Party democracy, criticism and self-criticism. This Party Charter will raise the Party's organizational work to a new and higher level.

Khrushchev concluded his report with the following words: Long live the strong Communist Party, confidently leading the Soviet people to new victories, to the victory of communism! Long live Comrade Stalin, the wise leader of the Party and the people, the inspirer and organizer of all our victories!

The Congress responded with stormy and prolonged applause. All stood.

The first to speak on Khrushchev's report "Amendments to the Charter of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" was Shkiryatov (Moscow). He said that under the banner of Lenin and under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Communist Party has gone through a glorious path of struggle and victory, and on the basis of the victories already achieved, it has put forward the main task of its activities - building a communist society.

The task of transitioning from socialism to communism places high demands on Party members. These requirements have been mentioned one by one in the draft Party Charter, and Comrade Stalin is the creator of this draft Party Charter. The revised Party Charter requires an increase in the responsibility of all Party members for the cause of the Party and for the implementation of the Party's resolutions. The revised Party Charter further enhances the title and significance of Communist Party members. The Party Charter clearly and explicitly describes the high obligations of Communist Party members and strictly stipulates the standards for Party members.

The most important task of all Party organizations is to strengthen the Party's supervision and inspection of the implementation of resolutions by all means, to develop criticism and self-criticism, and to consolidate Party and state discipline.

Shkiryatov talked about the great significance of attaching importance to the letters and complaints received by Party organizations. He listed facts of incorrect attitudes towards letters and complaints and incidents of suppressing criticism. He said: It is necessary to protect those who help expose shortcomings, and it is also necessary to expose and severely punish those who engage in slander.

Shkiryatov concluded by saying that our Party is unprecedentedly unified, united, and solid. It is confidently marching along the Stalinist road of building a communist society.

Then, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, Thorez, delivered a congratulatory message. The Congress delegates welcomed this leader of the French people with stormy and prolonged applause.

On behalf of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, Thorez extended warm and militant congratulations to the 19th Congress, the Soviet people, and the great Stalin. He said that the victorious communist society construction being carried out by the Soviet people excites and inspires the descendants of the Communards of 1871. He expressed the French workers' deep gratitude to the Soviet people for saving France and all mankind from fascist enslavement during the Great Patriotic War.

He said that the French workers know that the economic and social system of your socialist motherland is not aggressive in any way, and that the Soviet Union is an unbreakable fortress of peace in Europe and the world. Thorez said that millions of our compatriots solemnly swear: The French people will never, ever wage war against the Soviet Union!

This sentence aroused stormy applause from the entire audience.

Thorez ended his speech with the following words: Long live the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)! Glory to the great Lenin-Stalin Party! Glory to the teacher and leader of communists in all countries, the friend and elder brother of workers all over the world, the great Stalin! (Stormy and prolonged applause. All stood)

Then, delegate Furtseva (Moscow) spoke, saying that our country is in a condition of gradual transition from socialism to communism, and the arduous tasks we face require further improvement of all Party work. Since the closing of the 18th Party Congress, rich experience has been accumulated in Party building work. Comrade Khrushchev convincingly explained in his report the necessity of reflecting this experience in the Party Charter. The amendment to the Party Charter is caused by new political tasks, and its purpose is to continuously improve the Party's organizational weapons and increase the Party's vigilance.

The Communists in Moscow unanimously agreed with the draft amendment to the Party Charter, and paid special attention to the Party Charter's requirements for developing criticism and self-criticism. Furtseva pointed out that in Moscow's Party organizations, criticism and self-criticism are far from being regarded everywhere as the main means of helping to discover errors and shortcomings in work and overcome them. In those organizations where criticism and self-criticism are weak, there are major loopholes and faults.

Furtseva pointed out that the new draft Party Charter is permeated with Stalin's concern for the ideological and political education of Communist Party members. The Party Charter defines the task of Party organizations at all levels to further improve the political education of Party members and probationary members. The Moscow Municipal Party Committee is taking measures to strengthen Marxist-Leninist propaganda and improve the ideological and theoretical level of cadres.

Delegate Gimyayanin (Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic) said that we are honored to participate in the 19th Congress of the Lenin-Stalin Party, which unanimously approved the political line and practical work of the Central Committee of the CPSU (B). The Congress shows how great the victories of worldwide historical significance that the Soviet people have gained in the cause of communism due to the correct policies of the Communist Party and its organizational work in implementing these policies are.

The amendment to the Party Charter proves how much the Party values the work of building the Party's organization. He said that all members of the Communist Party organization in Belarus unanimously agreed with the draft amendment to the Party Charter, and are very satisfied with the fact that this most important Party document is aimed at further consolidating Party unity, strengthening the Party's strength and power. Communist Party members unanimously support the proposal to make the Party's name more accurate, stipulate its main tasks, and express their determination to work selflessly to accomplish these tasks.

Delegate Poskrebyshev spoke amid warm applause, emphasizing the historical significance of the 19th Party Congress, which determined that the main task at the current stage is to build communism. The construction of communism is the creation of millions of people. This is the inexhaustible creation and innovation of the workers, this is the high organization and discipline of the people, the true universal labor heroism, the very high culture of the workers in urban and rural areas. The better and more organized all Soviet citizens who are capable of working, the faster communism will come.

As stipulated in the new draft Party Charter, Communist Party members should first show themselves as models of treating labor with a communist attitude.

Poskrebyshev talked in detail about issues related to consolidating state and Party discipline, correctly selecting, allocating, and educating cadres, and striving to develop criticism and self-criticism.

The new draft Party Charter says it well that there cannot be two kinds of discipline in the Party, one for leaders and another for ordinary Party members. The Party has only one discipline, one law, and all Party members must abide by it, regardless of his merits and position. This means that Party and Soviet laws treat everyone equally without exception. Communist Party members, regardless of their position, should set a model example in implementing Party resolutions and abiding by Soviet laws.

The glorious historical tasks facing the Lenin-Stalin Party require raising the sense of responsibility of Party members for the cause of the Party. The new Party Charter raises the title and significance of Party members even higher.

Then, the General Secretary of the Spanish Communist Party, Ibarruri, delivered a congratulatory message. Ibarruri was welcomed by the Congress with stormy applause. Ibarruri's speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause.

She said, through you, through the delegates of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, I salute the people of the Soviet Union, the heroic people of the Soviet Union, who, in the arduous battle fires against the Hitler aggressors, saved the world from fascist enslavement and created conditions for the broad and rapid development of democracy in all countries.

She continued, Comrades, let me use the most sincere and brief words, words from the bottom of my heart and expressing the deepest respect and love, to pay tribute to our great leader and teacher, the organizer and inspirer of all the great victories of the Soviet people and all progressive forces in the world, our dear Comrade Stalin.

Ibarruri emphasized the great significance of the contribution of the Lenin-Stalin Party to the ideological and theoretical construction of communist parties in various countries. She said that the resolutions of the historically significant 19th Congress of the CPSU (B) are a great inspiration to the struggle of the Spanish masses for peace, freedom and democracy.

The General Secretary of the Socialist People's Party (Communist Party) of Cuba, Roca, congratulated the Congress and was warmly welcomed by the delegates. He said that the Cuban people see how remarkably the rapid growth of the Soviet economy contrasts with the continuous decline of production in their country and other capitalist countries.

The Cuban Socialist People's Party will persistently study the resolutions of the 19th Party Congress. He said that the experience of the Bolshevik Party, the doctrine of Lenin and Stalin, helps our organization consolidate and expand its ties with the working class and peasants.

He finally congratulated the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the great leader and teacher Stalin.

The morning session ended here.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 11th: The afternoon session of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on October 10th continued to discuss N.S. Khrushchev's report on "Amendments to the Charter of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)". The chairman of the meeting, Kuusinen, allowed Borisov, the representative of the Yakut Soviet Socialist Autonomous Republic, to speak.

Borisov said that the 19th Party Congress is the most significant event in the life of our great country. The reports at the Congress and the speeches of the leaders of the Party and the government showed the grand program of building communism in our country.

The report of the Central Committee of the Party, the draft directives on the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union for 1951-1955 (the Fifth Five-Year Plan) and the amendment to the Party Charter, all start from Comrade Stalin's historically significant speech at the voters' meeting on February 9, 1946, and his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR."

Borisov said: The Bolsheviks of Yakutia fully approved the new draft Party Charter in their Party meetings. Borisov proposed several amendments and supplements to the draft Party Charter.

Kozlov of Leningrad said: The Communist Party is strong because of the unity of its actions and because it is united around the Central Committee of the Party and the great Stalin. When the Party's main task is to build a communist society by gradually transitioning from socialism to communism, the new Party Charter enhances the Party's combat effectiveness and organizational strength.

Kozlov emphasized the importance of the Party Charter stipulating that Communist Party members have the obligation to develop self-criticism and criticism from below. The Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism developed in the Leningrad Party organization helped improve the activities of the Party's municipal committees and district committees, helped strengthen Party discipline, and made Communist Party members more active. When Kozlov spoke about ideological work, he said: There are still serious shortcomings in the Leningrad Party organization's work of conducting Marxist-Leninist education for intellectuals in institutions. He also mentioned the serious shortcomings in the work of selecting cadres and educating cadres.

Korimenko, a representative from Voroshilovgrad, said: The draft amendment to the Party Charter, which was drafted directly based on the teachings of J.V. Stalin, is based on the theory of Lenin and Stalin that the Party is the leading and guiding force of the Soviet state. Korimenko added: The discussion of the documents of the 19th Party Congress by the Party organization in Voroshilovgrad Oblast helped further promote inner-Party democracy, develop criticism and self-criticism, and make Communist Party members more politically active.

Finally, Korimenko gave a special introduction to the work of the Voroshilovgrad Oblast Party organization, which has achieved success in the Party's political and organizational work and in the development of economy and culture.

Yakubov, representative of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, said: The draft amendment to the Party Charter summarizes the experience accumulated by the Party and develops the basic organizational principles in accordance with the new historical situation.

Due to the development of communist construction, the Party's role as the leading and guiding force of society will be greatly enhanced. Therefore, the purpose of the new Party Charter is to further strengthen the Party's strength, further consolidate its ranks, and strengthen the leading role of Party organizations in all economic and cultural development.

The draft amendment to the Party Charter has been enthusiastically welcomed and sincerely supported by the vast number of Party members. At their gatherings and meetings, Azerbaijani Communist Party members put forward many opinions, wishes, and suggestions aimed at strengthening the responsibility of Communist Party members for the work of the Party. In conclusion, Yakubov said: The Azerbaijan Party Congress ordered its delegation to declare its full agreement with the amendment to the Party Charter of the CPSU Congress and assured the CPSU Congress that the Azerbaijan Party organization will gloriously complete all the tasks stipulated by the Party.

Alimov, representative of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, pointed out that the draft amendment to the Party Charter submitted to the 19th Party Congress for discussion reflects the changes that have taken place in the country since the 18th Party Congress.

Due to the discussion of the documents of the 19th Party Congress, the political enthusiasm of Party members and probationary members has been unprecedentedly improved. All Party primary organizations in Uzbekistan held meetings to discuss the draft amendment to the Party Charter, with more than 120,000 Communist Party members participating in the meetings and more than 36,000 people speaking.

After carefully studying the draft amendment to the Party Charter, the Communists in Uzbekistan unanimously agreed with this document and put forward many suggestions, all of which were for one purpose: to further enhance the Party's prestige, increase its strength, and improve its combat effectiveness to realize the task of communist construction. Alimov put forward some clear suggestions on certain provisions of the Party Charter to make these provisions more specific.

Afanasev, the representative of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, said: The draft amendment to the Party Charter puts forward new problems facing the Party. To solve these problems, it is necessary to further improve the level of the entire organizational work.

The amendment to the Party Charter is a powerful weapon. Every paragraph of it is permeated with Stalin's concern for enhancing the Party's role as the inspirer and organizer of the Soviet people in the struggle for victory in communism.

The Communists in Kazakhstan enthusiastically discussed the draft amendment to the Party Charter. This discussion greatly increased the enthusiasm of the Communists, strengthened inner-Party democracy, and developed criticism and self-criticism. When they expressed their approval of this draft, they put forward many suggestions and supplements, which proved that the Communists' ideological level has been improved and their sense of responsibility for realizing the great plan of communist construction has been increased.

After a short break, Saburov reported on the results of the work of a committee elected by the Congress, the work of which was to study the supplements to the draft directives on the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union (Fifth Five-Year Plan) for 1951-1955.

The Congress unanimously passed the directives of the 19th Party Congress on the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union (Fifth Five-Year Plan) for 1951-1955.

The meeting then continued to discuss Khrushchev's report. Gilichenkov, representative of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, rose to speak.

He said: The Ukrainian Party organization discussed and unanimously approved the draft amendment to the Party Charter. The new clauses in the Party Charter have improved the level of the entire work of the Party organization. The fact that the Central Committee's amendments and supplements to the Party Charter were very necessary has been best proved by the fact that the Communists measured their work, as well as the work of the Party, Soviet, economic organizations and their leaders, in accordance with the provisions of the draft amendment to the Party Charter.

The supplements on the need for all Party members to abide by a discipline without exception and the obligation of Communist Party members to develop criticism and self-criticism were enthusiastically supported. During the discussion of the draft amendment to the Party Charter, many Communist Party members criticized those who superficially supported criticism but actually stifled criticism from below in various ways.

At the afternoon meeting, many representatives of foreign communist parties delivered congratulatory messages to the Congress.

The Chairman of the Norwegian Communist Party, Løvlien, amid prolonged applause, expressed warm and fraternal congratulations to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its brilliant leader, J.V. Stalin.

He said that the Soviet people and the Soviet army defeated the Hitler army and directly liberated northern Norway from the oppression of the fascist occupiers. The Norwegian people are filled with sincere and deep gratitude to the Soviet people and the Soviet army.

In contrast to this feeling of gratitude from the people, the Norwegian ruling group implemented a policy of using shameless anti-Soviet propaganda to find excuses for expanding armaments.

Løvlien said that the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy and the great progress of Soviet socialist construction have inspired peace advocates around the world to fight for peace, against war, and to strengthen the peace and democracy camp.

When the representative of the Indonesian Communist Party took the stage, he was warmly welcomed by the Congress delegates. He extended congratulations to the Congress on behalf of the party, the working class, and the broad masses of Indonesia.

The representative of the Indonesian Communist Party described the suffering of the Indonesian people under the oppression of local feudal exploiters and foreign imperialists. He said that the Indonesian people are persistently struggling to win liberation, oppose the imperialists from launching another war, and strive for national independence, democracy, and lasting peace.

The representative of the Indonesian Communist Party read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Party signed by Secretary Aidit. The telegram said:

In the name of the Indonesian working class, we warmly congratulate the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!

We wish the Soviet Union further victories in its communist construction, because these victories give us hope for lasting peace and a happy future.

The representative of the Venezuelan Communist Party, Bolaños, rose to speak amid prolonged applause. He said that the news of the convening of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) reached the ears of people working in the most secret underground environment. The Venezuelan Communist Party, which is persecuted by the military fascist dictatorship, is carrying out activities in this environment. He said that despite the malicious slander propaganda, the vast working people of Venezuela still generally harbor feelings of sympathy and love for the Soviet people and the brilliant leader J.V. Stalin.

The delegates of the Congress warmly welcomed Bouhali, the Secretary of the Algerian Communist Party, who expressed warm and fraternal congratulations and wished the great leader and teacher of the working people of all countries, J.V. Stalin, a long life and good health.

Bouhali said that the imperialists are carrying out anti-Soviet slander, and they have the so-called "Iron Curtain," which they insist is hindering the establishment of contact with the Soviet people and the people of the People's Democratic countries. However, in reality, if there is such a curtain, this curtain was erected by the imperialists themselves. Comrades from Tunisia and Morocco could not attend the 19th Party Congress because they were refused passports to go abroad. Bouhali said that these measures are part of the oppression policy implemented by the imperialists in colonial countries. However, historical experience proves that no force in the world can stop the truth from spreading to even the most remote places on earth! (Applause)

Finally, Bouhali said, Dear Comrades! We sincerely wish you complete victory in implementing all your resolutions, and this victory will be a very important stage in the struggle to achieve our common ideals! (Applause)

The chairman of the meeting, Kuusinen, announced that the afternoon session was adjourned. The next meeting will be held on October 11.

    苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会第六日
    讨论联共党章的修正案
    大会通过关于新五年计划的指示
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会十日继续开会。上午会议由巴吉罗夫主持。大会开始讨论第四项议程：对苏联共产党（布尔什维克）党章的修正案。报告人是联共（布）中央委员会书记恩·斯·赫鲁晓夫。大会以暴风雨般的历久不息的掌声欢迎赫鲁晓夫。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我国之所以能够获得胜利，是由于党不倦地在群众中间为实现斯大林的天才计划进行了巨大的组织工作。党的组织工作把苏联人的一切努力集中起来致力于一个共同目标：在艰苦的战争年代里为打败敌人而奋斗，在战后为迅速恢复国民经济并使它进一步发展而奋斗、为成功地实现共产主义建设计划而奋斗。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在，当苏联人民以新的精力为实现建设共产主义社会的伟大计划而斗争的时候，共产党的指导和组织作用、它的组织和思想教育工作的意义不断地提高着。摆在我们面前的任务，向党组织和全体党员提出了更高的要求，在党的工作和党的建设中必须估计到这些要求。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，我们党经常改善它的工作方法，根据环境和新的任务改变党的建设的形式。自从第十八次党代表大会闭幕以来，我们党在建党方面有了新的经验，这些经验反映在党章里面。同时也必须注意到另一种情况：就是在上次代表大会通过的党章中有些地方已经过时了。因此，必须对党章加以补充和修正。
    赫鲁晓夫继而就具体的修正和补充加以说明，这些修正和补充在代表大会开幕以前经过了全党的讨论，现在由联共（布）中央委员会提交第十九次代表大会批准。
    接着赫鲁晓夫说道，代表大会就要通过的这个党章是具有极大的组织和动员力量的文件。它是对党员、党和政府的干部加强以列宁主义精神进行思想教育的重要手段，是进一步展开党内民主、批评与自我批评的重要手段。这个党章将把党的组织工作提高到新的、更高的水平。
    赫鲁晓夫用下面的话结束了他的报告：满怀信心地领导着苏联人民走向新的胜利、走向共产主义的胜利的、强大的共产党万岁！党和人民的英明领袖、我们一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者斯大林同志万岁！
    大会报以暴风雨般的历久不绝的鼓掌。全体起立。
    第一个就赫鲁晓夫的报告“对苏联共产党（布尔什维克）党章的修正案”发言的是施基利亚托夫（莫斯科）。他说，共产党在列宁的旗帜下，在斯大林同志的领导下，经历了辉煌的斗争和胜利的道路，并在已经取得的胜利的基础上提出了自己活动的主要任务——建设共产主义社会。
    从社会主义过渡到共产主义的任务向党员提出了高度的要求。这些要求在党章草案里已一一述及了，而斯大林同志就是这个党章草案的创造者。经过修正的党章要求提高全体党员对党的事业、对执行党的决议的责任。经过修正的党章更加提高了共产党员的称号和意义。党章十分清楚明白地叙述了共产党员的高度义务，严格规定了党员的标准。
    一切党组织的最重要的任务是用一切办法加强党对决议执行情况的监督和检查，展开批评和自我批评，巩固党和国家的纪律。
    施基利亚托夫谈到了重视党组织接到的信件和申诉的重大意义。他列举了对信件和申诉采取不正确态度的事实以及压制批评的事件。他说：必须保护帮助揭发缺点的人，同时也必须揭露并严厉惩办进行诽谤的人。
    施基利亚托夫最后说，我们党空前统一、团结和坚固。它满怀信心地沿着建设共产主义社会的斯大林道路迈进。
    接着法国共产党中央委员会总书记多列士致贺词。大会代表以暴风雨般经久不绝的鼓掌欢迎这位法国人民的领袖。
    多列士代表法国共产党中央委员会向第十九次代表大会、苏联人民、伟大的斯大林致以热烈的战斗的祝贺。他说，苏联人民进行的胜利的共产主义社会建设使一八七一年的公社社员的子孙们兴奋鼓舞。他向苏联人民表示法国劳动者的深深的感谢，感谢苏联人民在伟大的卫国战争中把法国和全人类从法西斯奴役下拯救出来。
    他说，法国劳动者知道，你们的社会主义祖国的经济和社会制度是没有任何侵略性的，苏联是欧洲和世界和平的牢不可破的堡垒。多列士说，我们千百万的同胞们庄严宣誓：法国人民决不、永远不对苏联作战！
    这句话引起全场暴风雨般的掌声。
    多列士用下面的话结束了他的发言：苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会万岁！光荣归于伟大的列宁—斯大林党！光荣归于各国共产党员的导师和领袖、全世界劳动者的朋友和长兄、伟大的斯大林！（暴风雨般的历久不息的掌声。全体起立）
    接着代表福尔切娃（莫斯科）发言说，我国处在从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的条件下，面临的艰巨任务要求进一步改进全部党的工作。自从第十八次代表大会闭幕以来，建党工作方面积累了丰富的经验。赫鲁晓夫同志在他的报告中令人信服地说明了把这种经验反映在党章里的必要性。对党章的修正是由新的政治任务而引起的，目的是要不断改善党的组织武器，提高党的警惕性。
    莫斯科的共产党员对党章修正草案一致表示同意，并特别注意党章关于展开批评和自我批评的要求。福尔切娃指出，在莫斯科党组织中还远非到处都把批评和自我批评当作帮助发现工作中的错误和缺点并克服它们的主要手段。在那些批评和自我批评薄弱的组织中，有着重大的漏洞和过失。
    福尔切娃指出，新党章草案渗透着斯大林对共产党员思想政治教育的关怀。党章确定了各级党组织进一步改进党员和候补党员的政治教育的任务。莫斯科市党组织正在采取措施以加强马克思—列宁主义的宣传和提高干部的思想理论水平。
    代表吉密亚宁（白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国）说，我们很荣幸地参加了列宁—斯大林党第十九次代表大会，这次大会一致批准了联共（布）中央委员会的政治路线和实际工作。代表大会表明：苏联人民由于共产党的正确政策及其执行这一政策的组织工作而在争取共产主义事业中获得的、具有全世界历史意义的胜利是如何伟大。
    对党章的修正，证明党是如何重视党的组织建设工作。他说，白俄罗斯共产党组织的全体党员对党章修正草案一致表示同意，并对这一事实非常满意，即这一最重要的党的文件旨在进一步巩固党的统一，加强党的力量和实力。共产党员一致支持关于使党的名称更加确切，规定它的主要任务的建议，并表示了为完成这些任务而忘我地奋斗的决心。
    代表波斯克列比舍夫在热烈的掌声中发言，他强调指出第十九次党代表大会的历史意义，第十九次党代表大会确定现阶段的主要任务是建设共产主义。共产主义建设是千百万人的创造。这是劳动者的永不枯竭的创造和革新，这是人的高度的组织性和纪律性、真正的普遍劳动英雄主义，城乡劳动者的非常高涨的高度文化。有劳动能力的全体苏联公民劳动得越好，越有组织，那么共产主义到来得就越快。
    如新党章草案所规定，共产党员应该首先表现为以共产主义态度对待劳动的模范。
    波斯克列比舍夫详细谈到了与巩固国家和党的纪律，正确地选拔、分配和教育干部，尽力展开批评和自我批评等有关的问题。
    新党章草案说得很好，在党内不能有两种纪律，对领导者一种，对普通党员另外一种。党只有一种纪律，一种法律，一切党员均须遵守，不管他的功劳和位置如何。这就是说，党和苏维埃法律对一切人都是毫无例外同等看待的。共产党员，不论在任何工作岗位上，都应该模范地以身作则执行党的决议和遵守苏维埃的法律。
    列宁—斯大林党面临的光辉的历史任务要求提高党员对党的事业的责任心，新党章把党员的称号和意义提得更高了。
    接着西班牙共产党总书记伊巴露丽致贺词。伊巴露丽受到大会暴风雨般掌声的欢迎。伊巴露丽的发言屡次被掌声打断。
    她说，我通过你们，通过苏联共产党的代表向苏联的人民致敬，苏联英雄的人民在反对希特勒侵略者的艰苦的战斗烈火里把世界从法西斯的奴役下拯救了出来，为各国广泛迅速发展民主创造了条件。
    她继续说，同志们，让我用最热诚的简短的话、用出自肺腑的话和表现最深的尊敬和热爱的话，向我们伟大的领袖和导师、苏联人民和全世界进步力量的一切伟大胜利的组织者和鼓舞者、我们亲爱的斯大林同志致敬。
    伊巴露丽强调指出列宁—斯大林党对各国共产党思想和理论建设事业的贡献所具有的巨大意义。她说，联共（布）具有历史意义的第十九次代表大会的决议对于西班牙人民群众争取和平、自由和民主的斗争是很大的鼓舞。
    古巴社会主义人民党（共产党）总书记罗加祝贺代表大会，他受到代表的热烈欢迎。他说，古巴人民看到，苏联经济迅速高涨，而他们的国家以及其他资本主义国家的生产则不断下降，两者之间成了一个如何显著的对照。
    古巴社会主义人民党将坚持地研究第十九次党代表大会的决议。他说，布尔什维克党的经验、列宁—斯大林的学说帮助我们的组织巩固、扩大跟工人阶级和农民的联系。
    他最后祝贺苏联共产党，祝贺伟大的领袖和导师斯大林。
    至此上午会议结束。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会十月十日下午会议继续讨论恩·斯·赫鲁晓夫的“对苏联共产党（布尔什维克）党章的修正案”的报告。会议主席库西宁让雅库特苏维埃社会主义自治共和国的代表波里索夫发言。
    波里索夫说，第十九次党代表大会是我们伟大国家的生活中一个最重大的事件。大会上的各项报告以及党和政府领袖们的演说，显示了在我国建设共产主义的宏伟纲领。
    党中央委员会的报告、关于第五个五年计划的指示草案以及党章修正案，都是从斯大林同志一九四六年二月九日在选民大会上所发表的具有历史意义的演说，以及他的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中所规定的伟大任务出发的。
    波里索夫说：雅库特的布尔什维克们在他们党的会议上完全赞成新党章草案。波里索夫提出了对党章草案的几项修正和补充。
    列宁格勒的科兹洛夫说：共产党所以强大在于它行动的统一，在于它团结在党中央委员会和伟大的斯大林的周围。当党的主要任务是用从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的办法来建设共产主义社会的时候，新党章提高了党的战斗力和组织力量。
    科兹洛夫着重指出了党章上规定共产党员有义务开展自我批评和自下的批评的重要性。列宁格勒党组织中开展的布尔什维克的批评和自我批评，帮助改进了党的市委员会和区委员会的活动，帮助加强了党的纪律并使共产党员更为积极。科兹洛夫谈到思想工作时说道：列宁格勒党组织在机关里面对知识分子进行马克思—列宁主义教育的工作，还存在着严重的缺点。他也提到选拔干部和教育干部工作中所存在着的严重缺点。
    伏罗希洛夫格勒代表科里孟科说：直接依据约·维·斯大林的学说而拟定的党章修正草案，是以列宁、斯大林关于党是苏维埃国家的领导和指导力量的理论为基础的。科里孟科又说：伏罗希洛夫格勒州的党组织关于第十九次党代表大会的文件的讨论，帮助进一步发扬了党内民主，开展了批评和自我批评，并使共产党员在政治上更加积极。
    科里孟科最后特别介绍了在党的政治工作和组织工作上、在经济和文化的发展上取得了成绩的伏罗希洛夫州党组织的工作。
    阿塞拜疆苏维埃社会主义共和国代表雅库伯夫说：党章修正草案总结了党所积累的经验，并依照新的历史情况发展了基本的组织原则。
    由于共产主义建设的开展，党作为社会的领导和指导力量的作用，将大大地增强。因此，新的党章的目的在于进一步加强党的力量，更进一步巩固它的队伍，加强党组织在一切经济和文化的发展方面的领导作用。
    党章修正草案得到了广大党员群众的极其热烈的欢迎和衷心的拥护。阿塞拜疆共产党员在他们的集会和会议上曾提出了旨在加强共产党员对党的工作的责任的许多意见、愿望和建议。雅库伯夫在结语中说：阿塞拜疆党代表大会命令它的代表团声明完全同意代表大会的党章修正案，并向联共代表大会保证：阿塞拜疆党组织将光荣地完成党所规定的一切任务。
    乌兹别克苏维埃社会主义共和国代表阿里莫夫指出，交给第十九次党代表大会讨论的党章修正草案反映了第十八次党代表大会以来国内所发生的变化。
    由于讨论了关于第十九次党代表大会的文件，党员们和候补党员们的政治积极性空前地提高了。乌兹别克所有的党基层组织都曾开会讨论党章修正草案，参加会议的共产党员在十二万人以上，发言的有三万六千多人。
    乌兹别克的共产党员在仔细研究党章修正草案以后，一致赞同这个文件，并提出许多建议，这些建议都是为了一个目的，就是更加提高党的威信，增加它的力量，改进它的战斗力以实现共产主义建设的任务。阿里莫夫就党章的某些规定提出了一些明确的建议，把这些规定具体化。
    哈萨克苏维埃社会主义共和国的代表阿芳诺夫说：党章修正草案提出了党所面临的新问题。要解决这些问题，就必须进一步提高整个组织工作的水平。
    党章修正案是一个强有力的武器。它的每一段都渗透着斯大林对提高党作为苏联人民在争取共产主义中的胜利的鼓舞者与组织者的作用的关怀。
    哈萨克的共产党员热烈讨论了党章修正草案。这种讨论大大提高了共产党员的积极性。加强了党内民主，开展了批评和自我批评。他们在表示赞同这个草案时，提出了许多建议和补充，它们证明了共产党员思想水平提高了，和对实现共产主义建设伟大计划的责任感增加了。
    在短时间的休会后，萨布罗夫就代表大会选出的一个委员会的工作结果作了报告，这个委员会的工作是研究对一九五一年—一九五五年苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）指示草案的补充。
    代表大会一致通过了第十九次党代表大会关于一九五一年—一九五五年苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示。
    会议跟着继续讨论赫鲁晓夫的报告。乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国代表吉利琴科起立发言。
    他说：乌克兰党组织讨论了并一致赞同党章修正草案。党章中的新条款已经使党组织整个工作的水平提高，这一事实最好地证明了，中央委员会对党章所作的修正和补充是非常必要的，共产党员依照党章修正草案的规定来衡量他们的工作，以及党、苏维埃、经济组织和它们的领导人的工作。
    关于一切党员必须毫无例外地遵守一种纪律以及共产党员有展开批评和自我批评的义务的补充受到了热烈的拥护。在讨论党章修正草案时，许多共产党员批评了表面拥护批评、实际上却以种种方法窒息自下的批评的人们。
    在下午会议上，有许多外国共产党的代表向大会致贺词。
    挪威共产党主席洛夫林在经久不息的掌声中，向苏联共产党及其天才领袖约·维·斯大林表示了热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    他说，苏联人民和苏联军队击溃了希特勒军队，并且从法西斯占领者压迫下直接解放了挪威北部，挪威人民对苏联人民和苏联军队充满了衷心的、深切的感激。
    与人民的这种感激心情成对照，挪威统治集团实行了利用无耻的反苏宣传来为扩张军备寻找藉口的政策。
    洛夫林说，苏联的一贯的和平政策和苏联社会主义建设的巨大进步，鼓舞了全世界和平拥护者争取和平、反对战争和加强和平民主阵营的斗争。
    印度尼西亚共产党代表登台时，受到大会代表的热烈欢迎。他代表印尼的党、工人阶级和广大群众向大会致贺。
    印度尼西亚共产党代表描述了印尼人民受到当地封建剥削者和外国帝国主义者压迫的苦难。他说，印尼人民正在坚持不渝地进行争取解放、反对帝国主义者发动另一次战争的斗争，和争取民族独立、民主与持久和平的斗争。
    印度尼西亚共产党代表宣读了由书记艾地签字的党中央委员会的贺电。电文说：
    以印度尼西亚工人阶级的名义，我们热忱地祝贺苏联共产党第十九次代表大会！
    我们敬祝苏联的共产主义建设获得进一步的胜利，因为这些胜利给予我们对于持久和平和幸福前途的希望。
    委内瑞拉共产党代表波拉尼奥斯在经久不息的掌声中起立发言。他说，苏联共产党（布尔什维克）召开第十九次代表大会的消息传到了在最秘密的地下环境中工作的人们耳里，受到军事法西斯独裁迫害的委内瑞拉共产党就是在这种环境里进行活动的。他说，尽管有恶毒的诽谤宣传，但委内瑞拉的广大劳动人民对于苏联人民和天才领袖约·维·斯大林依然普遍怀着同情和热爱的感情。
    代表大会的代表热烈欢迎阿尔及利亚共产党书记布阿利，他表达了热烈的、兄弟般的祝贺，并祝世界各国劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师约·维·斯大林万寿无疆，身体安康。
    布阿利说，帝国主义者正进行反苏诽谤，他们有所谓“铁幕”的说法，硬说是它阻碍了与苏联人民及人民民主国家的人民建立联系。但是，实际上如果有这样一个幕存在的话，这个幕也是帝国主义者自己竖立的。突尼斯和摩洛哥的同志们不能列席第十九次代表大会，因为他们被拒发出国护照。布阿利说，这些措施是帝国主义者在殖民地国家实行的压迫政策的一部分。但是，历史的经验证明，世界上没有任何力量可以阻止真理传布到甚至地球上最遥远的地方！（掌声）
    布阿利最后说，亲爱的同志们！我们衷心地祝你们在执行你们的全部决议时获得完全的胜利，这种胜利将是争取我们的共同理想之实现的斗争中一个非常重要的阶段！（鼓掌）
    会议主席库西宁宣布下午会议休会。下次会议将于十月十一日举行。
