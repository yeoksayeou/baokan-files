Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Venerable Dhammaratana, head of the Ceylon delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and four other members of the delegation, presented Buddha relics, palm-leaf scriptures, and a Bodhi tree to Chinese Buddhists on behalf of all Buddhists in Ceylon. Chinese Buddhists held a grand reception ceremony on the afternoon of the 1st. In addition to all the representatives of the Tibetan tribute delegation, more than 800 lamas, monks, nuns and lay Buddhists from temples in Beijing, there were also 35 representatives from Australia, Burma, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, Turkey, and Central American countries attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

	The hall, the Grand Hall of the Guangji Temple in Beijing, was decorated with special solemnity. Before the reception, Chinese Buddhists, represented by Ju Zan, Sheng Quan, Zhao Puchu, and Zhou Shujia, carried flowers and rode on decorated carts to welcome the Ceylon delegation. Monks and nuns in monastic robes were lined up from the gate of Guangji Temple to the Grand Hall to await them. When Venerable Dhammaratana respectfully carried the Three Treasures, bells and drums rang out in the temple, and all the lamas, monks, nuns, and lay Buddhists chanted "Namo Sakyamuni Buddha." The Ceylon representative Venerable Dhammaratana entered the hall, placed the Dharma treasures on the altar, and offered flowers, then recited the Three Refuges and Five Precepts. Burmese representatives and representatives of the Tibetan tribute delegation offered flowers and Hadas before the Buddha. Venerable Dhammaratana delivered a speech, happily saying: It is of great significance that the ceremony of presenting the Three Treasures can be held today—the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the eve of the opening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Venerable Dhammaratana continued: The Buddhist circles of China and Ceylon had a good friendship as early as the fourth century, when the Chinese monk Faxian visited Ceylon. Although there has been a long period of separation in the middle, we have now re-established our old friendship. And this relationship has been able to be restored due to the liberation of the Chinese people, the rise of the new China, and our joint efforts for the cause of peace. Dhammaratana finally said: The Buddha is a teacher of peace and compassion. But today, some people in the world are threatening mankind by launching wars of aggression. As disciples of the Buddha, we should not sit idly by. According to the teachings of the Buddha, we have a responsibility to work for peace. Therefore, the disciples of the Buddha have a responsibility to oppose wars of aggression and all evil preparations for attempting to expand wars of aggression. The disciples of the Buddha should unanimously demand the prohibition of atomic weapons and bacteriological weapons, and should demand an immediate cessation of the wars of aggression being waged in Korea and colonial countries. All countries should be required to resolve their disputes peacefully as said by Sakyamuni Buddha.

	Venerable Xu Yun accepted the gift on behalf of Chinese Buddhists and delivered a speech thanking the Ceylon Buddhist brothers for their kindness. Venerable Xu Yun said: Buddhists in our two countries should unite more closely, unite in the compassion and wisdom of the Three Treasures, and contribute all we have to the universal and lasting peace of the world. Then Venerable Dhammaratana recited the Pali scriptures again.

	Finally, Chinese representatives to the Peace Conference, Master Xirao Jiacuo and Venerable Yuan Ying, led the lamas, monks and nuns to recite Tibetan scriptures and vows, wishing the people peace and happiness, and wishing world peace. At this point, the grand reception ceremony came to an end.

    锡兰出席和平会议代表达马拉塔纳法师
    代表锡兰佛教徒向我国佛教徒赠献三宝 【新华社四日讯】出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的锡兰代表团团长达马拉塔纳法师及团员四人，代表锡兰全体佛教徒向中国佛教徒赠献佛舍利、贝叶经和菩提树。中国佛教徒于一日下午举行隆重的受礼典礼。参加典礼的除西藏致敬团全体代表，北京市各寺院八百多喇嘛、僧尼和居士外，还有出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的澳大利亚、缅甸、加拿大、印尼、日本、土耳其及中美洲各国的代表等三十五人。
    礼堂设北京广济寺的大雄殿，布置得特别庄严。受礼以前，中国佛教徒由巨赞、圣泉、赵朴初、周叔迦为代表，携带鲜花，乘着扎彩礼车，前往迎接锡兰代表团。穿着戒衣的僧尼、喇嘛，则排列在广济寺大门口至大雄殿间恭候。当达马拉塔纳法师恭举三宝到达时，寺内钟鼓齐鸣，众喇嘛、僧尼、居士同诵“南无本师释迦牟尼佛”。锡兰代表达马拉塔纳法师进入礼堂将法宝安置在供桌上并献花后，诵读三皈、五戒。缅甸代表和西藏致敬团代表在佛前献花、献哈达毕，达马拉塔纳法师致词，他高兴地说：赠献三宝典礼能选在今天——中华人民共和国建国三周年纪念日和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议揭幕的前夜举行，是有重大意义的。达马拉塔纳法师接着说：中国佛教界与锡兰佛教界早在四世纪的时候，就有过良好的友谊关系，那时中国的法显法师便访问过锡兰。中间虽然有长时期的间隔，但现在我们又重新恢复了旧有的友谊关系。而这种关系能够得以恢复，是由于中国人民之解放，新中国之兴起和我们共同致力和平事业而来的。达马拉塔纳最后说：佛是和平与慈悲的导师。但是在今天，世界上有些人正以发动侵略战争来威胁人类。我们作为佛的弟子，不应该坐视，我们依据佛的教训，有责任为和平而工作。因此，佛的弟子们，就有责任反对侵略战争和企图扩大侵略战争的一切罪恶准备，佛的弟子们就应该一致地同声要求禁止原子武器和细菌武器，应当要求立即停止在朝鲜及殖民地国家里进行的侵略战争，应当要求一切国家按释迦牟尼佛所说的用和平方法解决它们之间的争执。
    虚云法师代表中国佛教徒接受赠礼，并致词感谢锡兰佛教兄弟们的厚意。虚云法师说：我们两国的佛教徒应更亲密地团结起来，团结在三宝的慈悲智慧之中，为世界普遍的永久的和平而贡献我们的一切。接着达马拉塔纳法师又诵读了巴利文经。
    最后，出席和平会议的中国代表喜饶嘉措大师和圆瑛法师，分别率领喇嘛、僧尼诵读藏文经与发愿文，祝愿人民安乐，祝愿世界和平。至此，隆重的受礼典礼便告结束。
