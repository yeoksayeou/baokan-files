Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 29th: Liu Jingfan, head of the General Delegation, and 19 representatives of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, met with Korean people's leader General Kim Il-sung at 3:10 PM on October 26th. Also present were Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Park Heon-young, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Labor Party Park Chang-ok, Minister of National Defense Choi Yong-kun, Minister of Culture and Propaganda Heo Jeong-suk, and Director of the General Political Bureau of the People's Army Kim Jae-wook.

Also invited to the meeting were Gan Yetao, Charge d'Affaires of our Embassy in North Korea, and Generals Yang Dezhi and Liang Xingchu, representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

At the meeting, on behalf of all the Chinese people, Chief Delegate Liu Jingfan paid high tribute and cordial greetings to General Kim Il-sung and the Korean military and civilians under his leadership, who have demonstrated unparalleled heroism and made immortal contributions in the just struggle to defend their motherland, defend world peace, and oppose American imperialist aggression. He said: The heroic and unyielding spirit of hard struggle of the Korean people and the Korean People's Army has left a very deep impression on the Chinese people and has been wholeheartedly loved and respected by all the Chinese people. The Chinese people are determined to continuously strengthen the strength to support the Korean anti-aggression war until the Korean people achieve final victory and the Korean issue is fairly and reasonably resolved.

Then, the慰问团 delegation presented flags and gifts to General Kim Il-sung. The eight-foot-long, purple-red, gold-edged Xiang embroidery banner was embroidered with the following large characters: "The Chinese People Will Always Stand Firmly With the Brave Korean People to Fight for the Complete Victory Over the American Aggressors." The gifts included valuable items such as Xiang embroidery portraits of General Kim Il-sung, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Marshal Stalin, as well as colored tapestries. The tapestry was woven with the national flags of China and North Korea, with the ten large characters "Long Live the Solidarity Between the Chinese and Korean People" in the center.

In his speech, General Kim Il-sung expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people for their selfless assistance and great encouragement to the Korean people.

After the meeting, General Kim Il-sung held a grand banquet to cordially entertain the head of the General Delegation and representatives of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea. At the meeting, the guests and hosts frequently toasted to the health of General Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong, to the friendship between the Korean and Chinese people, and to the great victory of the heroic Korean and Chinese troops.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 29th: The full text of General Kim Il-sung's speech when receiving Liu Jingfan, head of the General Delegation, and 19 representatives of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea is as follows: Dear Head of Delegation, Deputy Head of Delegation, and all comrades of the慰问团 delegation:

Today, on behalf of all the Korean people, the Korean Labor Party, and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for coming from afar to慰问 cheer on our people. After you return to your motherland and meet Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, and all democratic parties, please convey to them my heartfelt gratitude for the great encouragement and assistance given to our people by the Chinese people in sending two慰问团 delegations.

The Korean people are convinced that with the help and support of the great Soviet Union and the great People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries, especially with the Chinese people sending their excellent sons and daughters to form the Volunteer Army to support us with their blood and flesh, the final victory will surely belong to the Korean and Chinese people. If the American imperialists undermine the armistice negotiations, the joint operations of the Korean and Chinese People's troops will completely crush the American imperialists' shameless aggressive ambitions and defend world peace.

Finally, I hope that after you comrades return to your country, you will introduce the Korean people's determination to persevere to the end and their confidence in victory to the Chinese people as much as possible, so that the Chinese people can hold the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea even higher.
