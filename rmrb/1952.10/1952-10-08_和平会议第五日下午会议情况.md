Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The fifth day of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference continued on the afternoon of the 6th.

    The Executive Chairmen for the afternoon session were: Le Dinh Tham (Vietnam), Alfredo Di Amestoy (Chile), Gyan Chand (India), Chung Sung-un (Korea), and ? Ba Se Sasunthorn (Thailand).

    The meeting began at 3:30 PM, presided over by Le Dinh Tham, head of the Vietnamese delegation. The afternoon session heard a supplementary report from the US delegation on the Korean issue and seven speeches. Speakers came from different regions of Asia, North America, Latin America, and Europe, representing countries living under different social systems, but all expressed the common desire for peace of their own people.

    The US delegation presented a supplementary report on the Korean issue at the meeting (to be issued separately, see page 2). The report was read by Mrs. Serna, a member of the US delegation. When Mrs. Serna finished reading the statement of the US delegation in the kind and firm tone of the American people, the audience stood up and burst into thunderous applause, expressing the people of all countries' ardent sympathy and support for the American people's struggle for peace.

    Then, an unforgettable scene appeared in the hall. The US delegation presented gifts symbolizing peace and friendship—flowers and an evergreen tree—to the representatives of the Korean people, who were engaged in arduous struggle. Mr. Huitton, head of the US delegation, read a dedicatory speech after presenting the gifts: "We, the American people, admire bravery and hate brutality; we ask you to plant this small tree in the land of Korea, a land that has been sanctified by the blood of its heroic people. May this small tree grow like the friendship between our two peoples; may this small tree, along with the green leaves of life nourished by sunshine and rain, remain evergreen, and use its shade to shelter your children and grandchildren in a safe, beautiful, and peaceful environment." After the dedicatory speech, Huitton warmly shook hands and embraced Han Xueye. The American representatives pinned peace badges on the Korean representatives and shook hands and embraced each other warmly. Immediately afterwards, three Australian female representatives stepped onto the stage and presented flowers and clothes for Korean children sent by Australian mothers to the Korean female representatives. At this moment, the whole audience wholeheartedly gave joyful and enthusiastic applause again and again for this brotherly and close unity between the people.

    Subsequently, Anisimov, head of the Soviet delegation and member of the Soviet Peace Committee, delivered a speech (to be issued separately). All attendees expressed a special welcome to the representative from the powerful world peace fortress with warm applause.

    Anisimov quoted Stalin's famous words that peaceful resolution of international disputes and peaceful coexistence of different systems are entirely possible and necessary. Stalin's name and his words were warmly welcomed by the audience.

    The meeting then heard a speech by Grassi (Italy), Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions. He first pointed out that peace is indivisible for workers everywhere. Maintaining and safeguarding peace is the common desire of all workers and their families. However, today, the imperialist policy of arms expansion and war preparation has made the living conditions and working conditions of the vast working masses even worse. However, Grassi emphasized that the struggle of millions of workers against the policy of war and against poverty and oppression is developing more and more strongly. These struggles indicate that the working masses are becoming more aware that the struggle for peace and the struggle for bread, work, freedom, and national independence are inextricably linked. Grassi then expressed the solemn attitude of the World Federation of Trade Unions towards the issue of peace. He said: The World Federation of Trade Unions fully supports the proposals made by Guo Moruo in his general report. The World Federation of Trade Unions has expressed to the governments of the countries concerned the extremely firm will of workers all over the world to prevent the revival of German and Japanese militarism. We demand an end to the Korean War, the withdrawal of foreign troops, an unconditional ban on weapons of mass destruction, and the punishment of those criminals who ordered germ warfare against Korea and Northeast China. Grassi finally emphasized that the fundamental reform of the social conditions of the masses of people in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries is only possible when the struggle for peace and national independence is successful. The World Federation of Trade Unions must unite all workers who are striving for peace and the happiness of the people, and must use all its strength to realize this wish.

    The next speaker was Antonio Cruz Franco, head of the Guatemalan delegation and chairman of the Guatemalan National Peace Committee. He reported on the development of the peace movement in Guatemala, saying: We and millions of people around the world hope that the Korean people and other people suffering from the scourge of war will immediately achieve peace. At the end of May this year, the First Peace Congress was held in Guatemala City. The congress expressed great anger at the US armed forces for dropping bacteriological bombs on the residents of Korea and China. The congress agreed to launch a strong protest, appealing to all men and women in the world to strive to punish those responsible for this heinous crime. Our country's peace movement also pointed out that the rearmament of Japan is a serious threat to the peace of Asia and the world. He finally declared that the Guatemalan delegation is prepared to support all the resolutions of this historic and great Asian and Pacific nations peace conference to defend peace. His words won warm applause from the audience.

    Manuel Agustín Aguiar, head of the Ecuadorian delegation and university professor, delivered a speech (to be issued separately, see page 2). Manuel Agustín Aguiar's speech was repeatedly drowned out by enthusiastic applause.

    The meeting adjourned here and continued at 6:40 PM under the chairmanship of Alfredo Di Amestoy.

    At the meeting, Jacinto Castellanos Rivas, representative of El Salvador, took the floor. He began by saying that authoritative reports have already condemned the countless unjust atrocities of the greedy imperialist aggressors. He then announced that, at this moment, according to a telegram received the day before, the military government of El Salvador, under the orders of the US Embassy, has used this peace conference as an excuse to launch a new wave of persecution against peace advocates, detaining, torturing, and exiling them en masse. He specifically delivered a statement on behalf of the El Salvador delegation against the militarization of Latin American countries. The statement briefly stated: The El Salvador delegation believes that the second item on the agenda of the conference regarding opposition to the re-militarization of Japan is timely and necessary, and this proposal is completely correct and therefore supports it. But at the same time, the El Salvador delegation believes that while Japan's re-militarization constitutes a universal threat, the militarization of Latin American countries also seriously threatens the peace of Asian and Pacific countries, and this danger, which has not yet been specifically manifested, must also be clearly condemned. Jacinto Castellanos Rivas then used the situation in El Salvador to illustrate the fact that militarism exists in Latin America. He emphasized that the militarization of Latin American countries first poses a serious danger to the peace of that region, and therefore may also pose a serious danger to other much larger regions. Therefore, the El Salvador delegation proposes the following to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference: to oppose the militarization of Latin American countries, especially countries in the Pacific region, first, to prevent these countries from preparing and mobilizing to serve the interests of aggressive war profiteering; second, to prevent the instigation of some countries on the American continent to use war to resolve certain disputes that exist between them.

    The conference then heard a speech by Samawi, the representative of Iraq, on the peace movement in the Middle East and Near East. He extended greetings to the conference on behalf of the people of the Middle East and Near East countries. Samawi pointed out that due to the strategic importance and oil reserves of the Middle East countries, the Middle East countries occupy a special importance in the imperialist plan. Imperialism attempts to drag the Middle East into the war plans of the Middle East Command they have organized, constantly building military bases in the Middle East, and controlling the Middle East countries in all aspects. Samawi said that the people of this region demand peace and national independence. He described the situation of the vigorous movement launched by the people of the Middle East countries against the Middle East Command, demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops, and demanding national autonomy. This movement has united people from all walks of life. He went on to say that the struggle of the people of the Middle East for national independence is closely linked to the very broad struggle for peace and against war. The people of the Middle East support the struggle of the Korean people, demanding an end to the Korean War and the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. They oppose the re-militarization of Japan and Germany. Samawi finally put forward three demands of the people of the Middle East and Near East: 1. National independence and world peace. 2. Stop the wars in Korea and Vietnam, foreign troops withdraw from Korea and Vietnam, and let their people freely choose their own political system. 3. Disarm Japan, US troops withdraw from Japan, and the Japanese people have the freedom to organize their own democratic government. After Samawi finished speaking, the audience stood up and applauded warmly, paying tribute to the envoy of the peace-loving people of the Middle East and Near East.

    Jacob Magus, the representative of Israel, then spoke. He emphasized that the people of Israel are closely watching the struggle of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions for freedom, independence, and peace. He said: Your struggle is our struggle—your hope is also our hope. Magus then talked about the history of the Jewish people's past suffering. He pointed out that the will of the Israeli people to survive determines their struggle for peace. His speech also aroused enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    Finally, the conference accepted a huge silk banner presented by the clergy and all the believers of the Beijing Diocese of the Chinese Catholic Church.

    The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM.

    和平会议第五日下午会议情况
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第五日会议在六日下午继续进行。
    下午会议的执行主席是：黎廷探（越南），阿尔弗莱脱·第·阿迈斯脱（智利），杰安·昌德（印度），郑圣彦（朝鲜），?巴色·飒顺吞（泰国）。
    会议在下午三时三十分开始，由越南代表团团长黎廷探主持。下午会议听取了美国代表团关于朝鲜问题的补充报告和七个发言。发言人来自亚洲、北美洲、拉丁美洲和欧洲的不同的地区，代表着生活在不同社会制度下的国家，但都表明了他们本国人民爱好和平的共同愿望。
    美国代表团在会上提出关于朝鲜问题的补充报告（另发，见第二版）。报告由美国代表塞尔奈夫人宣读。当塞尔奈夫人以美国人民的善良而坚定的语调读完了美国代表团的声明之后，全场起立，并发出震耳的掌声，表示各国人民对美国人民和平斗争的热切同情和支援。
    接着，会场上出现了令人难忘的情景。美国代表团把象征着和平与友谊的礼物——鲜花和一棵常绿树献给艰苦斗争中的朝鲜人民的代表们。美国代表团团长惠吞在献礼后宣读献词说；“我们美国人民，赞美勇敢，憎恨残暴；我们请求你们把这一棵小树，种在朝鲜的土地上，那块因染上英雄人民的血而变得神圣的土地上。愿这棵小树像我们两国人民的友谊一般成长；愿这棵小树和受着阳光与雨露滋长的生命的绿叶一起常青，用它的绿荫，在安全、美好与和平的环境中，庇护着你们的子子孙孙。”惠吞在献词后，和韩雪野亲切地握手拥抱，美国代表们为朝鲜代表们佩上和平纪念章，并互相热烈地握手，紧紧地拥抱在一起。紧接着有三个澳大利亚的女代表走上主席台，把鲜花和澳大利亚的母亲们送给朝鲜儿童的衣服献给朝鲜女代表。这时，全场都出自深心地一再为人民之间的这种兄弟般的亲密团结发出欢愉的热烈的掌声。
    随后，苏联代表团团长、苏联拥护和平委员会委员阿尼西莫夫发言（另发）。全体到会者对于这位来自强大的世界和平堡垒的代表，用热烈的鼓掌表示了特别的欢迎。
    阿尼西莫夫引用了斯大林关于和平解决国际间的分歧以及不同制度和平共存是完全可能和必需的名言。斯大林的名字和他的话都受到全场热烈的欢迎。
    会议接着听取世界工会联合会书记处书记葛拉西（意大利）的发言。他首先指出：对于各地工人来说，和平是不可分割的。维护与保障和平，是所有工人和他们的家庭的共同愿望。可是今天，帝国主义的扩军备战政策已使广大劳动群众的生活情况和工作条件更加恶化。但是，葛拉西强调说：千百万工人反对战争政策、反对穷困与压迫的斗争，正发展得愈来愈强大。这些斗争表示工人群众更加清楚地认识到争取和平的斗争和争取面包、工作、自由和民族独立的斗争是紧紧不可分的。葛拉西接着表示了世界工会联合会对于和平问题的严正态度。他说：世界工联全力支持郭沫若在他的总报告中所提出的那些建议。世界工联已向有关各国政府表示全世界工人们极为坚决的意志，一定要阻止德日军国主义的复活。我们要求结束朝鲜战争，撤退外国军队，无条件禁止大规模毁灭的武器，并惩办那些命令对朝鲜与中国东北进行细菌战的罪犯。葛拉西最后强调说：资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国家的人民群众社会条件的根本改革，只有在争取和平与民族独立的斗争获得成功时才有可能。世界工联一定要把一切争取和平和人民幸福的工人团结起来，并且要用一切力量使这种愿望实现。
    接着发言的是危地马拉代表团团长、危地马拉全国和平委员会主席安东尼奥·克鲁斯·弗兰哥。他报告危地马拉和平运动的发展情况，他说：我们和全世界千百万人民都盼望朝鲜人民和其他遭受战争惨祸的人民立即得到和平。今年五月底，在危地马拉城召开了第一届和平大会。大会对于美国武装部队向朝鲜和中国的居民投掷细菌弹表示极大的愤怒。大会同意发起一个有力的抗议，向世界一切男女呼吁，要他们力争惩办那些对这种可恶的罪行负责的人。我国的和平运动，还指出日本重新武装对于亚洲及世界各国的和平是一个严重的威胁。他最后宣称：危地马拉代表团准备支持这一有历史意义的、伟大的亚洲及太平洋国家和平会议各种保卫和平的决议。他的话博得了全体的热烈鼓掌。
    厄瓜多尔代表团团长、大学教授曼努爱尔·阿古斯丁·阿吉勒发表演说（另发，见第二版）。曼努爱尔·阿古斯丁·阿吉勒的演说一再为热烈的掌声所淹没。
    会议至此休息，于六时四十分在阿尔弗莱脱·第·阿迈斯脱主持下继续进行。
    会上，萨尔瓦多代表哈辛多·卡斯特兰诺斯·瑞瓦斯上台发言。他首先说，已经有权威的报告谴责了贪婪的帝国主义侵略者无数非正义的暴行。他接着宣布：就在这个时候，根据前天收到的电报，萨尔瓦多的军事政府奉美国大使馆的命令，已借口这个和平会议掀起来一个对和平拥护者的新的迫害浪潮，把他们成批地拘禁、拷问和放逐。他特代表萨尔瓦多代表团发表一项关于反对拉丁美洲国家军国主义化的声明。声明略称：萨尔瓦多代表团认为会议议程第二项关于反对使日本重新军国主义化的问题是切合时宜和必要的，这个提议是完全正确的，因而拥护这个提议。但是同时，萨尔瓦多代表团认为，固然日本的重新军国主义化构成了普遍的威胁，而拉丁美洲国家的军国主义化也严重地威胁着亚洲及太平洋国家的和平，而且这一个还没有具体表现出来的危险，也必须极明确地加以谴责。哈辛多·卡斯特兰诺斯·瑞瓦斯接着用萨尔瓦多的情况来说明拉丁美洲军国主义存在的事实。他强调说：那么，拉丁美洲国家的军国主义化首先对于那个地区，因而也就可能对于其他更大得多的地区的和平构成一个严重的危险。因此，萨尔瓦多代表团向亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议提出下面的建议：反对拉丁美洲国家，特别是在太平洋区域里的国家的军国主义化，第一，防止准备并动员这些国家去为侵略性的贩卖战争的利益服务；第二，防止鼓动美洲大陆上的一些国家用战争来解决他们之间存在的某些纠纷。
    大会接着听取伊拉克代表萨马威关于中东、近东和平运动的情况的发言，他代表中东、近东各国人民向大会致敬。萨马威指出：由于中东各国的战略重要性及石油贮藏，中东各国在帝国主义的计划里占着特殊重要性。帝国主义企图把中东拉到他们所组织的中东司令部的战争计划里去，不断地在中东建筑军事基地，在各方面控制中东各国。萨马威说，但是这个地区的人民要求和平和民族独立。他叙述了中东各国人民展开蓬蓬勃勃的反对中东司令部、要求撤退外国军队、要求民族自主的运动的情况，这个运动团结了各个阶层的人民。他接着说，中东人民争取民族独立的斗争和非常广泛的争取和平和反对战争的斗争密切结合在一起。中东人民支持朝鲜人民的斗争，要求停止朝鲜战争及禁用细菌武器。他们反对日本和德国的重新军国主义化。萨马威最后提出中东、近东人民的三项要求：一、民族独立和世界和平。二、制止在朝鲜和越南进行的战争，外国军队撤出朝鲜和越南，让它们的人民自由选择他们自己的政治制度。三、解除日本军备，美国军队撤离日本，日本人民有组织他们自己的民主政府的自由。萨马威发言毕，全场起立热烈鼓掌，向中东、近东爱好和平的人民的使者表示敬意。
    以色列代表贾可布·马九斯接着发言。他强调指出以色列人民密切注视着亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民争取自由、独立与和平的斗争。他说：你们的斗争就是我们的斗争——你们的希望也就是我们的希望。马九斯接着谈到了犹太人过去的苦难的历史，他指出：以色列人民要求生存的意志，决定了他们要为和平而斗争。他的发言同样引起全场的热烈掌声。
    最后，大会接受了中国天主教北京教区神职班和全体教徒献赠的巨幅锦旗。
    会议在下午七时三十分宣告休会。
