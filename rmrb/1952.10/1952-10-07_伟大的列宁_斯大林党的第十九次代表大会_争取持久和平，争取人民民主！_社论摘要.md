Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, October 6th: The organ of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" recently published an editorial entitled "The Great 19th Congress of the Lenin-Stalin Party," saying: The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) will open on October 5th in Moscow, the great capital of the Soviet Union. Workers, peasants, and far-sighted intellectuals of all countries, all who cherish peace, freedom, and independence, and all who hate the shackles of capitalism and bloody imperialist wars, greet this historic event of great international significance with great joy and pride. The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) is a congress of the strongest and most seasoned party in the world, founded and cultivated by the brilliant proletarian strategists Lenin and Stalin; it is a congress of warriors who selflessly and heroically struggle for communism, for world peace, and for friendship among all peoples and nations. Every congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union marks a new stage in the life and struggle of the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet people, and the international communist movement. The congresses of the Lenin-Stalin Party brightly illuminate the path towards the brilliant future of mankind, and practically demonstrate the invincible power of the universally applicable doctrine of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin. The world-historical victories achieved by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party are also victories for millions of ordinary, honest people around the world, because the strength of the Soviet Union is the foundation of the strength of the entire camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. The steady progress of the Soviet people from socialism to communism fills the working people of the People's Democratic countries, who are successfully building socialism, with courage, and inspires the working people in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries who are struggling for peace, bread, freedom, and against imperialist reactionaries. The Lenin-Stalin Party is the leading force and the vibrant revolutionary core of Soviet society; it organizes and directs all activities of the Soviet socialist state. The policy of the Communist Party is the foundation of the Soviet system.

The editorial stated: Nearly twenty years ago, Comrade Stalin said that in capitalist countries, there are no ruling parties with a correct line that is being implemented; they are all living a life without a future, struggling in chaotic crises, and unable to see a way out of their predicament. Comrade Stalin said: "Only our party knows the correct direction of action and is moving smoothly in this direction. Why does our party have this advantage? It is because it is a Marxist party, a Leninist party. It is because its work is guided by the theories of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. There is no doubt that as long as we remain faithful to this theory and as long as we hold on to this compass, we will surely be victorious in our work in the future." The Lenin-Stalin Party firmly and confidently fulfills its great historical mission. The party has traversed a long and glorious road from the initial Marxist groups to the great Bolshevik Party that realized the socialist revolution in Russia and now leads the most powerful socialist country in the world. This road itself vividly proves the great vitality of Marxism-Leninism; it is the victory of the Bolshevik Party's wise policy and the all-encompassing genius of V.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin. The Lenin-Stalin Party has united its ranks in fierce struggles. Unity has ensured the party's victory over the enemies of the working class and all working people. No other political party in history has exerted such a tremendous influence on the course of historical development as the Lenin-Stalin Party. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people have greatly consolidated their multinational state, enhanced its international prestige, and made the Soviet Union a great international force that exerts a tremendous influence on international life in accordance with the interests of the working masses and the interests of peace and security of all peoples. The Soviet Union's consistent and unwavering foreign policy of peace reflects the hopes of all progressive humanity striving to consolidate lasting peace.

After analyzing the evolution of the international situation between the two major camps after World War II, the editorial pointed out: Today, the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism is infinitely stronger than the imperialist camp, which is riddled with internal strife and divisions. The invincible movement of our time—the peace movement—is growing stronger day by day. In the great competition between the two systems of socialism and capitalism, the decisive superiority of the socialist system has become increasingly apparent year by year. Never in history has a social system experienced such rapid development and such large-scale construction as the Soviet socialist system. The Soviet people, having become masters of their own destiny, under the encouragement of the Lenin-Stalin Party, have set an example for the world of transforming society according to new principles—socialist principles. In the period since the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the party of Lenin and Stalin has achieved sweeping victories in developing the Soviet socialist system. During the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin, defended the achievements of socialism, crushed German imperialism and Japanese imperialism, and liberated the people of Europe and the world from the threat of fascist enslavement. Whether during the war or during peaceful construction, the Lenin-Stalin Party has always been constantly consolidating the moral and political unity of Soviet society, strengthening the friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, and promoting life-giving Soviet patriotism. In the post-war years, the Soviet Union has achieved new historical victories in economic and cultural construction. Countless ships are sailing on the Volga-Don Canal named after V.I. Lenin—the first construction of the great communist construction projects.

The editorial emphasized: The great creativity of the Soviet system and the leadership and guiding role of the Lenin-Stalin Party are also reflected in the draft directives of the 19th Party Congress on the new Five-Year Plan. This document presents a magnificent prospect for new and great development in all sectors of the Soviet national economy and for further improvement in the living standards and cultural levels of the working people. Its completion and overfulfillment will take the Soviet Union a big step forward on the road from socialism to communism. Now, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a fighting, united, and single revolutionary organization of ideologically consistent communists, and has achieved remarkable victories in expanding and strengthening the fraternal relations between the Soviet people and the working people of all countries. The editorial said: For all Communist and Workers' Parties, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a model of a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist party. According to the provisions of the draft revision of the Party Constitution, the main task of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union now is to build a communist society through the gradual transition from socialism to communism, to gradually improve the material and cultural level of society, to educate members of society with the spirit of internationalism and establishing fraternal ties with the working people of all countries, and to extremely strengthen the active defense of the Soviet motherland against the aggressive actions of its enemies. The editorial then elaborated on the duties of Communist Party members as stipulated in this draft revision of the Party Constitution.

The editorial concluded: These exciting and encouraging days before the opening of the Congress have repeatedly demonstrated, with extraordinary depth and strength, the Soviet people's boundless love and loyalty to the Lenin-Stalin Party, and the respect and admiration of the people of the socialist camp and the working people of the world for the Lenin-Stalin Party, because the Lenin-Stalin Party illuminates the road to communism for mankind. The working people of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and the German Democratic Republic are greeting the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) with a new and surging wave of labor enthusiasm. The people of capitalist countries and colonies and dependencies are eagerly studying every word about the achievements and plans of Soviet communist construction, words that fill them with confidence in future victories. The 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is a new milestone in the struggle for world peace, and a fatal blow to the plots of imperialist aggressors. The ruling clique in Washington and its servants in Western Europe and elsewhere are doing everything they can to prevent people from knowing the truth about the Soviet Union, and are doing everything they can to distort the historical documents of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The kept newspapers of the capitalists and the running dogs of American imperialism—the right-wing social democratic leaders, the fascist Tito spy and assassin gang, and other enemies of the working people—are trying to trap ordinary people in a maze of deception and slander, and are trying to poison their minds. But the truth cannot be covered up! The people of the world are increasingly convinced that socialism means freedom from exploitation, freedom from economic crises, freedom from unemployment and poverty, and genuine freedom; it means a happy and pleasant life for the people, and it means continuous progress and peace; while capitalism means hunger and poverty, oppression and enslavement, wars of plunder, and it means the suffering and disaster of hundreds of millions of people. The working people of all countries are uniting more and more closely around the banner of peace, democracy, and socialism, around the Soviet Union, and around Stalin, the standard-bearer of peace, the teacher and leader of all progressive humanity.

    伟大的列宁—斯大林党的第十九次代表大会
    ——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”社论摘要
    【新华社六日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特讯：共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”最近一期以“伟大的列宁—斯大林党的第十九次代表大会”为题发表社论说：苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会将于十月五日在伟大的苏联首都莫斯科开幕。各国工人、农民和有远见的知识分子，一切珍视和平、自由与独立的人们，一切憎恨资本主义枷锁和血腥的帝国主义战争的人们，都以十分愉快和骄傲的心情来迎接这个具有重大国际意义的历史事件。苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会是无产阶级光辉的战略家列宁和斯大林所创立与培养起来的、世界上最强大的、受锻炼最久的党的代表大会；它是为共产主义、为全世界和平、为各国人民及各族人民之间的友谊而进行忘我的英勇斗争的战士们的代表大会。苏联共产党的每一次代表大会都标志着布尔什维克党、苏联人民和国际共产主义运动的生活与斗争中的新阶段。列宁—斯大林党的各次代表大会光芒万丈地照耀着走向人类的辉煌灿烂的前途的道路，用实践证明了马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林放之四海而皆准的学说的不可战胜的力量。苏联人民在列宁—斯大林党的领导下所取得的具有世界—历史意义的胜利同时也是全世界千百万普通的、正直的人的胜利，因为苏联的力量是整个和平、民主与社会主义阵营的力量的基础。苏联各族人民从社会主义向共产主义的稳步进展，使得正在顺利地建设社会主义的各人民民主国家的劳动人民充满了勇气，并鼓舞了各资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国中为争取和平、面包、自由与反对帝国主义反动派而进行斗争的劳动人民。列宁—斯大林党是苏维埃社会的领导力量和生气蓬勃的革命核心；它组织着和指导着苏维埃社会主义国家的各种活动。共产党的政策是苏维埃制度的生存基础。
    社论说：在差不多二十年以前，斯大林同志曾说过，在资本主义国家中，没有任何有正确的路线而又加以实现的执政党；它们都是过着一种没有前途的生活，都是在紊乱不堪的危机里面挣扎，看不出什么逃出绝境的道路。斯大林同志说：“只有我们的党才知道正确动作的方向，并循着这个方向顺利前进着。我们党为什么有这种优势呢？就是因为它是马克思主义的党，是列宁主义的党。就是因为它的工作是以马克思、恩格斯、列宁的学说为指南。毫无疑问，只要我们始终忠实于这个学说，只要我们始终把握着这个指南针，那我们今后在自己的工作中也一定会胜利的。”列宁—斯大林党坚定地、满怀信心地履行着它的伟大的历史任务。党从最初的马克思主义小组发展成为在俄国实现社会主义革命及现在领导着世界上最强大的社会主义国家的伟大的布尔什维克党，经历了一段漫长而光荣的道路，这段道路的本身就生动地证明了马克思—列宁主义的伟大活力；这是布尔什维克党的英明政策以及乌·伊·列宁和约·维·斯大林的无所不包的天才的胜利。列宁—斯大林党在激烈的斗争中使自己的队伍团结一致。团结一致保证了党对工人阶级的和一切劳动人民的公敌的胜利。历史上没有任何其他政党像列宁—斯大林党这样对历史发展过程给予这样巨大的影响。在布尔什维克党和斯大林同志的领导下，苏联人民大大地巩固了他们的多民族的国家，提高了它的国际威望，并使苏联成为一个按照劳动群众的利益和各国人民的和平与安全的利益对国际生活施以巨大影响的一支伟大的国际力量。苏联的一贯的、坚定不移的爱好和平的外交政策，反映了一切努力争取巩固而持久的和平的进步人类的希望。
    社论分析了第二次世界大战以后国际间两大阵营情况的演变以后指出：今天，和平、民主与社会主义阵营和因内部自相倾轧而发生裂隙的帝国主义阵营比较起来，是无限地强大了。我们这个时代的不可战胜的运动——和平运动——在日益壮大着。在社会主义和资本主义这两个制度的巨大竞赛中，社会主义制度的决定性的优越性已经一年年地愈来愈明显了。历史上从来没有一个社会制度有过像苏维埃社会主义制度所有的这样飞跃的发展和这样大规模的建设。苏联人民，在成为自己命运主人之后，在列宁—斯大林党的鼓励之下，给全世界树立了
    一个依据新原则——社会主义原则——改造社会的榜样。在联共（布）第十八次代表大会以后的这个期间，列宁与斯大林的党在发展苏维埃社会主义制度上，已获得了横扫一切的胜利。在伟大的卫国战争期间，苏联人民在苏联共产党和斯大林同志的领导下，保卫了社会主义的成果，粉碎了德国帝国主义和日本帝国主义，并把欧洲和全世界人民从法西斯奴役的威胁下解救出来。无论在战争期间或者和平建设的期间，列宁—斯大林党总是不断地巩固着苏维埃社会在道德上和政治上的团结，巩固着苏联各族人民的友爱并且发扬着给予生命的苏维埃爱国主义。在战后年代中，苏联在经济上文化建设上取得了历史性的新胜利。络绎不绝的船只正在以乌·伊·列宁命名的伏尔加河—顿河运河——伟大共产主义建设工程的第一个建设——行驶着。
    社论强调指出：苏维埃制度的伟大的创造力和列宁—斯大林党的领导和指导作用也表现在第十九次党代表大会关于新五年计划的指示草案中。这个文件展示着苏联国民经济所有部门获得新的巨大发展和劳动人民生活水平与文化水平获得进一步提高的雄伟前景。它的完成和超额完成，将使苏联在从社会主义向共产主义过渡的道路上迈进一大步。现在，苏联共产党已经是一个思想一致的共产主义者的战斗的、团结的、单一的革命组织，并且在扩展和加强苏联人民和各国劳动人民之间的兄弟关系上获得了卓越胜利。社论说：强大的社会主义阵营的兴起是布尔什维克党国际主义政策的一个胜利。对于所有的共产党和工人党来说，苏联共产党是一个革命的马克思—列宁主义政党的典范。根据党章修正草案的规定，现在苏联共产党的主要任务是，通过由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的途径来建立共产主义社会，逐步提高社会的物质和文化水平，用国际主义及与各国劳动人民建立兄弟联系的精神来教育社会成员，极度加强苏维埃祖国对其敌人侵略行动的积极防御。社论接着详述了这次党章修正草案规定的共产党员的义务。
    社论最后说：代表大会开会以前这些令人兴奋鼓舞的日子，一再以非凡的深度和力量证明了苏联人民对列宁—斯大林党的无限热爱与忠诚，证明了社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界劳动人民对列宁—斯大林党的尊敬和钦仰，因为列宁—斯大林党为人类照耀着走向共产主义的道路。中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚和德意志民主共和国的劳动人民以新的、高涨的劳动热潮迎接联共（布）第十九次代表大会。资本主义国家和殖民地、附属国的人民热切地耽读着关于苏联共产主义建设的成就和计划的每一个字句，使他们对未来的胜利满怀信心的字句。联共（布）第十九次代表大会是争取世界和平的斗争史上的一块新的里程碑，是对于帝国主义侵略者的阴谋的一个致命的打击。华盛顿的统治集团及其在西欧和其他各地的仆从竭力不让人民知道苏联的真实情况，竭力歪曲联共（布）第十九次代表大会的历史性文件。资本家的御用报纸及美帝国主义的走狗们——右翼社会民主主义领袖、法西斯铁托间谍和暗杀者匪帮以及劳动人民的其他敌人——力图把普通人陷入欺骗和诽谤的迷阵中，力图毒害他们的心灵。但是，真理是掩盖不住的！全世界人民日益相信，社会主义就意味着免除剥削、免除经济危机、免除失业和贫穷而获得真正的自由；意味着人民过幸福愉快的生活，意味着不断的进步与和平；而资本主义则意味着饥饿和贫穷、压迫和奴役、掠夺战争，意味着亿万人民的困苦和灾难。各国劳动人民越来越紧密地团结在和平、民主和社会主义的旗帜的周围，团结在苏联的周围，团结在和平的旗手、全体进步人类的导师和领袖斯大林的周围。
