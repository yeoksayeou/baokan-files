    Since its opening on the 12th, the tournament held 236 matches, attracting over 7,000 spectators.

In order to develop table tennis and improve skills, the athletes also held forums to exchange experiences.

He also pointed out: Table tennis is a very good sports activity and has great value in promoting physical health, so it should be promoted. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and local sports associations, all table tennis players should not only continue to work hard to improve their skills, but also become active promoters and organizers of this sport, so that this sport can be widely developed to enhance the people's physique and serve the country's production and national defense construction.
