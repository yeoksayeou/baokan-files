    At Youth Gully in the Lesser Khingan Mountains
    By Our Correspondent Yong Jin
    In mid-September, I traveled north from the forestry city of Yichun, along the Yao River and the Kunlunqi River, into the virgin forests of the Lesser Khingan Mountains. The flowing water of the Kunlunqi River draws people into a beautiful landscape. The green pine forests on the mountains are interspersed with groups of white birch trees. The leaves of the broad-leaved trees are light yellow. The forests also contain serviceberry trees, whose leaves are as red as maple leaves in Jiangnan. The wormwood beneath the trees emits an alluring fragrance. Everyone who comes here will be excited by this rich and beautiful land.
    At the end of a newly built road are several sunny areas. To extract the timber needed by the country, forestry workers have built some houses here. Beside the houses, a clear mountain stream flows, which is where the famous Youth Team of the Lesser Khingan Mountains does its logging. Youth League members play an active role in this team, enabling it to complete all the arduous tasks assigned by higher authorities. Because this area of forest has no name, the forest workers call it Youth Gully. The young workers have cleared a small square in this dense forest. After work, they happily beat gongs and drums, perform Yangko dances, and stage plays and sing songs they have composed themselves. From their composed "Four Seasons Song," "Logging at the Fifth Watch," and "Preparation Work Tune," it is clear that they are full of interest and joy in their work.
    At the fifth watch, the crescent moon shines in the west,
    The logging workers are so happy.
    This year's task is 55,000 cubic meters,
    We must all work hard.
    Find the tricks, tap the potential,
    We must learn Soviet technology.
    In their workshops and at the logging sites, their own songs inspire them to cut more timber for the country.
    Before the establishment of the Youth League organization, superstitious "mountain rules" and internal malpractices tightly bound this group of lively young people. No one dared to say "tiger," only "Mountain God," because "Mountain God" was the tiger's nickname. During breaks, they were not allowed to sit on tree stumps because that was the "Mountain God's seat." The foremen often tied a piece of red cloth on tall pine trees with the words "Mountain God" written on it, and before dawn, they forced the workers to kneel there and pray for their safety throughout the day. Anyone who didn't kowtow would be pointed at by the foreman, who would say, "If something happens, I'll find you." One worker said he dreamed of a tiger at night, and the foreman ordered his wages to be withheld for a day. If someone broke a bowl while eating, the foreman would say:
    "Someone is going to die today." So he would let the entire team rest for a day and make the worker who broke the bowl pay for the whole team's wages for the day, form sworn brotherhoods, create small cliques, and recognize "adopted fathers" was also extremely common. People had to do this to ensure they were not discriminated against or treated unfairly. Fights broke out once or twice every day. Anyone who worked actively would be told by the foreman: "So eager to wear mourning hats! So eager to grab flowered coffins!" The change in this bad style came after the Communist Party sent a Youth League member, especially after it was renamed the "Youth Work Team." The establishment of true democratic life enabled the young workers to actively unite around the Party and the League. Now there are fifteen Youth League members in this Youth Work Team. The Party branch of the Fourth Work Unit is preparing to accept several outstanding Youth League members into the Party.
    I stayed in this Youth Work Team for several days and nights. The young workers told me that there are no more sworn brotherhoods, recognized "adopted fathers," or small cliques here now. Friendship and unity have become common. Everyone is closer than real brothers. A united, tense, and happy atmosphere is built on sincere, frank criticism and self-criticism. At meetings and on wall newspapers, you can see their praise for comrades who do good work and their criticism and self-criticism of all mistakes. This approach has turned many comrades who made mistakes in the past into models. The workers pointed to Zhou Chengfa, who had just returned from attending the branch bureau's labor model conference, and said: "He used to be so backward! Others were studying, but he was sleeping; when others tried to persuade him and give him advice, he said, 'What's the point of learning that? It can't be eaten or spent.'" When he received a letter from home, he couldn't understand it himself. Others took the opportunity to educate him, and he finally admitted his mistake and resolved to study. Now he has bought a pen and always carries a notebook in his pocket. He can now write letters and read popular books. He not only studies well but also works well and has been named a labor model. The Youth League accepted him as a member.
    Yu Quancai used to be the most unwilling to accept criticism. When others had difficulties at work and asked him for advice, he would say: "I don't know;" "There's a captain, there's a foreman, why are you asking me?" The comrades in his group asked him to examine himself, and he said, "I have nothing to examine." But finally, after everyone earnestly gave him advice and reasoned with him at the general meeting, he finally realized his mistake. The workers applauded to welcome him as soon as they saw Yu Quancai make a slight change. He made five guarantees in front of everyone. Later, the workshop chairman encouraged him not only to correct his mistakes but also to strive to become a model. He did everything actively. Three months later, he took on seven apprentices. The workers showed him boundless enthusiasm and care and elected him as a model. The leadership promoted him to work unit leader. He said with emotion: "The comrades' criticism is truly helping me, and the Party is truly saving me."
    The young people here are completing the glorious tasks given to them by the country with a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm. Work team leader Xu Cai pointed to the banner of "Advanced Team in Patriotic Production Competition" hanging on the wall and narrated their work. How did they complete the task of floating 45,000 cubic meters of timber? In the spring in the Lesser Khingan Mountains, before the ice on the Kunlunqi River had completely melted, they went into the river to remove the stones obstructing the flow. In June, the timber in the river piled up into stacks, which the adult work team couldn't dismantle in three days. The leadership sent the Youth Work Team to handle it. They braved the danger of the river water and jumped into the water, dismantling the 1,800-meter timber stack in a day and a half. Yang Yishan, a demobilized soldier who lost his thumb in the Battle of Fakun, told me that during this year's floating, all the timber, both the largest and the smallest, was floated down. Floating timber is not as easy as we imagine. If the water is low, it won't flow; if the water is high, it will "wander in the garden," and it can easily pile up into stacks. They used the method of spreading out the timber flow, increasing the distance of one gate of water flow from one li to three li.
    Opening up roads in the virgin forest and living in the forest for a long time is not without difficulties. Especially in the beginning, the vegetables and everything needed had to be carried on the back from far away through knee-deep black mud. It was under these circumstances that the task of "cutting tree shadows" (felling trees along the route for building transport roads) fell on the Youth Work Team. This task was originally scheduled to be completed in forty days, but they completed it in thirty days. The task of sawing timber was originally scheduled for forty days, but they also completed it in thirty days. The task of transporting timber was originally scheduled for thirty days, but they completed it in twenty days. The task of leveling the grounds was originally scheduled for twenty-eight days, but they completed it in twenty days. The task of building houses was originally scheduled for thirty days, but they not only completed it in thirty days but also reduced the labor by eighty workdays for each house. They fully realized what they said in their patriotic pledge: complete work tasks on time, improve quality, and eliminate waste and idleness. They not only completed the production tasks but also did not damage a single ax or saw this year and created the miracle of no casualties. Although they did not kowtow to the "Mountain God." I observed in the forest farm that the reason they had no casualties was that they held a meeting under the trees before the start of logging every day to study the direction in which the trees would fall and how to saw the wood. Technical personnel provided guidance before each tree fell. They consciously and strictly paid attention to safety work.
    In the Youth Work Team's house, there are four covenants posted on the wall, each with several articles. Thanks to their efforts, whether it is a patriotic covenant, a safety covenant, a learning covenant, or a fire prevention covenant, they have all been effectively implemented.
    Working in the forest is hard, but the lives of these young people are affluent and their bodies are strong. They usually eat rice and white flour, sometimes sorghum rice. Although there are not many kinds of vegetables, they have enough tofu and radishes at every meal. Wood ear and mushrooms can also be easily found in the forest to eat.
    Some of the forestry workers here are farmers from disaster areas. Chu Liancai from Kaiyuan County was introduced here by the government last year during the flood. The flood washed away the things he had been allocated during the land reform, but he remitted eight million yuan to his family within a year. His house was rebuilt, and he bought five new quilts and re-purchased the things that had been washed away by the flood. Work team leader Xu Cai excitedly talked about his family's living situation. He and his brother remitted nearly 20 million yuan to their family in two years. His family added a horse and installed glass windows. His mother's clothes are no longer tattered but new blue calico clothes. He recently married the director of a village women's association. He bought his wife clothing material, quilt covers, and rubber shoes. His wife said in her letter to him: "Produce more logs in the forest to support the front and build the country. I hope you will study technology well and become a labor model." Xu Cai is not the only one living such a happy life. Many other young people have also established or are brewing to establish happy families.
    The young workers here like to say that their Youth Gully is a school. This is indeed the case. They engage in intense study every day after dinner. Even the new workers who have only been here for a short time and were illiterate in the past have learned at least two or three hundred characters. The students in the second grade of the spare-time school, who could only recognize a few characters or their own names in the past, can now mostly keep accounts and write letters. The students in the third grade can mostly read newspapers and scripts. The fourth grade has already learned fractions in mathematics. In addition to strictly implementing the two-hour study system, the young workers often take out their pens and notebooks during breaks in the forest and practice writing and keeping diaries on the felled pine trunks and on their knees. They are extremely interested in the rapid literacy method. They have already sent someone to Harbin to learn the rapid literacy method so that they can promote it in this forest school.

    在小兴安岭青年沟
    本报记者　勇进
    九月中旬，我自林业城市伊春往北，沿着腰河，昆仑气河进入小兴安岭原始林区。昆仑气河的流水，把人引入幽美的图境之中。山峦上青翠的松林里，夹杂着白色的桦树群。阔叶树的叶子呈现着淡黄色。树林里还夹杂着有如江南枫叶一般鲜红的栨木果树。树下面的艾草发出诱人的芳香。所有的人来到这里，都会为这富饶的、美丽的河山而感到兴奋。
    一条新辟马路的尽头，有几片阳光充足的地带。林业工人为了开采祖国所需要的木材，在这里建筑了一些房屋。房屋的一边，清澈的山涧淙淙地流过，这就是小兴安岭著名的青年工队采伐的地方。青年团员们在这工队里起着积极的作用，使工队完成了上级给予他们的一切艰巨的任务。因为这一带的山林没有名字，森林的工人们就把这里称作青年沟。青年工人们在这稠密的山林里打扫出一小片广场，工作之余，他们就尽情地敲打着锣鼓，扭起秧歌，上演自己编的戏剧，歌唱自己编的歌曲。从他们编的四季歌、采伐五更里、准备作业小曲里，可以看出他们对自己的工作充满兴趣，洋溢着快乐。
    五更里，月牙照正西，
    采伐的工友们好欢喜。
    今年的任务是五万五千米，
    我们大家一定要努力。
    找窍门，挖掘潜在力，
    苏联技术要学习。
    在他们的工房里，在伐木的现场里，他们自己的歌声鼓舞着自己为国家采伐更多的木材。
    在没有青年团组织之前，这里还有迷信的“山规”和内部的恶习，紧紧地约束着这群活泼的青年。无论谁也不敢说老虎，只能说“山神爷”，因为“山神爷”是老虎的奶名。休息的时候，不许坐在树头上，因为那是“山神座”。把头们常常在高大的松树身子上捆一块红布，上面写着“山神爷”，天不明就强迫工友们跪在那里，祈祷他们一天的安全。谁不去磕头，把头就会指着他说：“出了事找你。”一个工友说他晚上梦见了老虎，把头就勒令停发他一天的工资。吃饭时如果有人打个碗，把头会说：
    “今天非死人不行。”于是让全工队的工人休息一天，让这个打碗的工友把全队工人一天的工资赔出来，拜把兄弟，拉小团体，认干老子，也是极普遍的事。人们必须这样，才能保证自己不受歧视和冤枉气。打架斗殴，每天都有一两起。谁工作积极，把头就会说你：忙着抢孝帽子戴呀！忙着抢花头棺材呀！这种坏作风的改变，是在共产党派来了一个青年团员，特别是在改为“青年工队”之后。真正的民主生活的建立，使青年工人们积极地团结在党和团的周围。现在这个青年工队里已有十五个青年团员了。第四作业所党支部，正准备接受几个优秀的青年团员入党。
    我在这个青年工队里逗留了几昼夜。青年工人们告诉我：现在这里再也没有拜把兄弟、认干老子和闹小团体的了。人们的友谊团结变成普遍的了。大家比亲兄弟还亲。团结、紧张的愉快空气是建筑在真诚的坦白的批评和自我批评上。在会议上，在墙报上，你会看到他们对一切工作好的同志所进行的表扬，也会看到他们对一切错误所进行的批评和自我批评。这种做法，使过去不少犯错误的同志变成了模范。工人们指着刚出席分局劳动模范大会回来的周成法说：他过去可落后啦！人家学习，他睡觉；别人劝他，给他提意见，他说：“学那干啥？不能当饭吃，又不能当钱花。”他家里来了信，他自己看不懂，别人趁机会教育他，他才向大家承认错误，下决心学习。现在他买了钢笔，口袋里整天装着日记本，他已经能写信、能读通俗书了。他不但学习好，工作也好，被评为劳动模范。青年团接受他为团员。
    于泉才，过去是最不肯接受批评的一个。别人工作上有了困难，向他请教，他就说：“我不知道；”“有队长，有现场员，你问我干什么？”小组里的同志叫他检讨，他说我没啥检讨。但是，最后经过大家在大会上恳切地给他提意见，说道理，他终于认识了错误。工人们看到于泉才稍有转变，马上鼓掌欢迎他。他在大家的面前订了五条保证。后来车间主席鼓励他，不但要改正错误，还要争取模范。他都积极做了。三个月后，他带了七个徒弟。工人对他报以无限的热情和爱护。并选他当了模范。领导上又提升他为作业所长。他感动地说：“工友们批评我，才是真正地帮助我，党真正地救了我。”
    这里的青年们以高度的爱国热情完成着国家所给予他们的光荣任务。工队长徐才指着墙上挂的那面
    “爱国主义生产竞赛先进小队”的锦旗叙述他们的工作。他们怎样完成流送四万五千米木材的任务呢？小兴安岭的春天，昆仑气河的冰还没有化完，他们就下到河里，把阻碍流送的石头搬出来。六月间，河里的木材堆成垛，壮年工队拆了三天没拆动。领导上派青年工队去搞，他们冒着河水冲击的危险，跳下水去，一千八百米的木垛一天半的时间就拆完了。一个在法库战役中被打掉大拇指的复员军人杨义山告诉我：他们在今年流送当中，无论最大的和最小的木材，都流送下去了。流送木材并不是像我们想像的那样容易。水小了就流不动，水大了就会“逛花园”，稍微不巧还会堆成垛。他们运用木材散开的流送方法，使一闸水流送一里提高到三里。
    在原始森林里开出路来，又长期地生活在森林里，也并不是没有困难的。特别是在刚开始的时候，吃的蔬菜和一切需要的东西都要从很远的地方踏着膝盖深的黑泥背上来。就在这样的情况下，打树影
    （为修运输道路而把路线上的树木伐掉）的任务落在青年工队的身上。这一任务原定四十天完成，他们三十天就完成了。锯材的任务原定四十天，他们也以三十天完成了。运材原定三十天，他们二十天完成了。平房场原定二十八天，他们二十天完成了。盖房子原定三十天，他们不仅在三十天完成了，并且使每个房子减少八十个工。他们完全地实现了他们在爱国公约上说的：按期完成工作任务，提高质量，消灭浪费与窝工。他们不仅完成了生产任务，而且今年以来没有毁坏过一个斧头和一条锯，并创造了没有伤亡事故的奇迹。虽然他们并没有给“山神爷”磕头。我在林场里观察了他们所以没有伤亡事故的原因是：他们在每天采伐开始的时候，先开树下会，研究树倒的方向和如何锯木。每当树倒之前，都有技术人员指导。他们对保安工作是自觉地严格地注意了的。
    在青年工队的房子里，墙壁上贴着四项公约，其中又有若干条，由于他们的努力，不管是爱国公约或安全公约，学习公约或防火公约，他们都切实地实现了。
    森林的工作是艰苦的，但这些青年们的生活是优裕的，身体是健壮的。他们平常都吃大米白面，有时吃顿高粱米。虽然蔬菜的种类还不多，但他们每顿有足够的豆腐和萝卜。木耳和蘑菇，也可以随便从森林里找来吃。
    这里的林业工人，有的是来自灾区的农民。开原县的褚连才，就是去年水灾时由政府介绍到这里来的。洪水冲走了他土地改革时分得的东西，可是他在
    一年之内就给家里汇去八百万元。他家的房子又重新盖了起来，还买了五条新被子并重新购置了被洪水冲走的东西。工队长徐才兴奋地谈起他家的生活情形。他弟兄两个，二年内寄给家里近两千万元。他家添了一匹马，安起了玻璃窗。他母亲的衣服已不是破烂不堪而是新的青洋布衣服了。他不久前和一个村妇女会主任结了婚。他给他的爱人买了衣料、被面和胶鞋。他爱人在给他的信上说：“你在森林里多生产些原木，好支援前线，建设国家。希望你好好学习技术，当个劳动模范。”过着这样美满日子的人，并不是徐才自己。还有不少的青年也已经有了或正在酝酿着成立美满的家庭。
    这里的青年工人们，爱说他们青年沟是座学校。事实正是这样。他们在每天晚饭以后，即从事紧张的学习。就是那些才来不久的过去不识字的新工友，也至少认识了二、三百字。业余学校二年级的学生过去只能认几个字或认识自己的名字，现在多能记账写信了。三年级的学生多能看报看剧本了。四年级的数学已经学到了分数。青年工人们除了严格执行两小时学习制外，在林场里休息的时候，也常掏出钢笔和本子，在砍倒的松树干上和膝盖上练习写字和记日记。他们对速成识字法感到极大的兴趣。他们已经派了一个人去哈尔滨学习速成识字法，以便在这座森林学校里推行。
