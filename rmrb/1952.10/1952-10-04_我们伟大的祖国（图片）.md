    Our Great Motherland
    The production level of our country's civil industry, like other production levels, has not only recovered in the past three years but has also exceeded the highest level in history. The textile industry has developed rapidly. This is the Zhejiang Linen Textile Factory, which is relatively large in our country. Workers in the weaving workshop of the factory are happily and busily working.
