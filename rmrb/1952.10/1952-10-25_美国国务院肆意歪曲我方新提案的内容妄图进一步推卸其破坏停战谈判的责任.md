Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 23rd: The U.S. government is now manipulating the United Nations to refuse to distribute General Kim Il-sung's and General Peng Dehuai's letter to Clark and the full text of the Korean Armistice Agreement draft at the United Nations General Assembly, attempting to block the truth about the U.S. side's sabotage of the Korean armistice negotiations. On the other hand, the U.S. State Department issued a statement filled with lies, wantonly distorting the content of these two documents in an attempt to further shirk the responsibility for the U.S. side's closing the door to armistice negotiations.

The U.S. State Department's statement mentioned the October 8th proposal of the Korean-Chinese side, which was reiterated by General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai in their letter to Clark. However, they did not dare to reveal the true content of the Korean-Chinese side's proposal in any way, not even the main content. They did not dare to touch upon it, but only picked out two points to distort and shout that the Korean-Chinese side's proposal was a "regression." The main content of the Korean-Chinese side's proposal includes four steps: according to the U.S. proposal, all prisoners of war on both sides should be sent to the demilitarized zone and handed over to the other side, joint Red Cross teams should conduct visits and explanations, and the prisoners of war should be classified according to nationality and region before being repatriated home. Here, in order to dispel the U.S. concerns, the Korean-Chinese side separated exchange from repatriation. However, the U.S. State Department completely ignored this point. Secondly, the U.S. State Department dared not publish the fact that the neutral nations inspection teams should be present to observe all four steps from exchange to repatriation. They only shouted about the Korean-Chinese side's "regression" on the point of when the joint Red Cross teams would conduct visits. In fact, Sub-item 57 of the draft armistice agreement already stipulates that the task of the joint teams before the completion of the exchange of prisoners of war still exists, and the task of the Korean-Chinese side's October 8th proposal regarding the joint teams' visits and explanations to the prisoners of war after the completion of the exchange of prisoners of war is a new addition. This can only be said that our new proposal is a step forward, and in no way can it be called a "regression."

The U.S. State Department also said that the Korean-Chinese side "regressed in another aspect" because the letter from General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai to Clark "stipulated that the communists could determine the hometown location of the prisoners of war before repatriation," "while in March 1952, the communists had agreed not to demand the repatriation of those prisoners of war who lived in the Republic of Korea before June 25, 1950." The U.S. State Department is completely fabricating facts here. First of all, the method of classification by nationality and region proposed by the Korean-Chinese side is obviously to distinguish the nationality and hometown location of each person according to the original register and the individual's proof. How can it be said that the Korean-Chinese side "determined the hometown location of the prisoners of war"? Secondly, the Korean-Chinese side proposed a principle on March 27, 1952, that "all foreign armed personnel captured by both sides, that is, captured personnel of the United Nations forces or the Chinese People's Volunteers, should be repatriated home; all Korean armed personnel captured by both sides, that is, South Korean soldiers or Korean People's Army soldiers, whose homes are in the area originally belonging to one side should be repatriated home, and those whose homes are in the area held by the receiving side may be allowed to return home locally without repatriation." This principle is also the classification principle proposed by the Korean-Chinese side in the October 8th proposal. The U.S. side did not oppose this proposition at that time. Now the U.S. State Department describes this proposition as the Korean-Chinese side agreeing to the U.S. proposition. If so, both sides should apply this principle to resolve the repatriation issue. Isn't the so-called "regression" of the Korean-Chinese side unfounded? In March, the Korean-Chinese side also advocated repatriation home after classification, and today it still advocates repatriation home after classification. Where exactly is the "regression" that the U.S. State Department refers to?

The above analysis shows that the U.S. State Department's statement completely relies on blocking our documents and deliberately distorting them in order to defend and cover up their unreasonable behavior of sabotaging the negotiations and refusing to resume negotiations. In fact, this is a very weak defense and concealment. It can only make people see more clearly the truth that the United States is deliberately sabotaging the negotiations in order to increase tensions.

### 美国国务院肆意歪曲我方新提案的内容妄图进一步推卸其破坏停战谈判的责任

    美国国务院肆意歪曲我方新提案的内容妄图进一步推卸其破坏停战谈判的责任
    【新华社开城二十三日电】美国政府现在一方面操纵联合国，拒绝将金日成、彭德怀两将军给克拉克的信和朝鲜停战协定草案全文在联合国大会上分发，企图封锁美方破坏朝鲜停战谈判的真相，另一方面由美国国务院发表满纸谎言的声明，肆意歪曲这两个文件的内容，企图进一步推卸美方关闭停战谈判之门的责任。
    美国国务院的声明中提到了金日成、彭德怀两将军在致克拉克信中所重申的朝中方面十月八日提案，但他们不敢以任何方式来说出朝中方面提案的真正内容，甚至仅仅是主要内容，他们也不敢触及，而只是挑出两点来加以曲解，大叫朝中方面的提案是“退步了”。朝中方面提案的主要内容包括四个步骤：按照美方提议，将双方全部战俘送到非军事区交与对方，联合红十字小组进行访问和解释，将战俘按国籍地区分类，然后再行全部遣返回家。在这里，朝中方面为了解除美方的顾虑，把交换与遣返分开。可是美国国务院却把这一点完全不提。其次，在从交换到遣返的四个步骤中，朝中方面都规定要由中立国视察小组在场观察，美国国务院也不敢发表这一点。他们只是就联合红十字小组何时进行访问这一点上嚷叫朝中方面“退步了”。其实停战协定草案第五十七款子项所已经规定了的联合小组在交换战俘工作尚未完成以前的任务仍然是存在的，而朝中方面十月八日提案中关于联合小组在交换战俘工作完成以后对战俘进行访问和解释的任务，则是一种新的增加，这只能说我们的新提案是进了一步，而无论如何不能说成是一种“退步”。
    美国国务院还说朝中方面“在另一个方面也退步了”，因为金日成、彭德怀两将军给克拉克的信中“规定共产党可以在进行遣返之前确定战俘的家乡所在地”，“而在一九五二年三月，共产党就已同意不要求遣返那些在一九五○年六月二十五日以前家住大韩民国的战俘”。美国国务院在这里完全是在虚构事实。首先朝中方面所提的按国籍地区分类的办法显然是要根据战俘原来的册籍和本人的证明分别各人的国籍和家乡地点的，这如何能说是由朝中方面“确定战俘的家乡地点”呢？其次，朝中方面曾在一九五二年三月二十七日提出一个原则，即“双方所俘获的外国武装人员，即联合国军或中国人民志愿军被俘人员，全部遣返回家；双方所俘获的朝鲜武装人员，即南朝鲜军或朝鲜人民军被俘人员，其家在原属一方地区者全部遣返回家，其家在收容一方地区者可以许其就地回家，不必遣返。”这个原则也就是朝中方面在十月八日提案中所提的分类原则。美方在当时并未反对这一主张，现在美国国务院又把这一主张说成是朝中方面同意美方的主张，既如此，双方就应该应用这一原则来解决遣返问题。美国所谓的朝中方面的“退步”岂不是无的放矢？朝中方面在三月也是主张在分类之后进行遣返回家，今天仍然是主张在分类后进行遣返回家，美国国务院所谓的“退步”究竟在那里？
    上面的分析使人看出美国国务院的声明完全是倚靠封锁我方文件，故意加以曲解，以为他们自己破坏谈判并拒绝恢复谈判的无理行为辩护和掩饰。事实上这是一个十分无力的辩护和掩饰，它只能使人更加看透美国居心破坏谈判以便增加紧张局势的真相。
