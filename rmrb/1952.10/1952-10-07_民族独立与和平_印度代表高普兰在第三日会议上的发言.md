National Independence and Peace
——Speech by Indian Representative Gopalan at the Third Day Meeting

Mr. Chairman and Friends:

The issue of national independence—true political and economic independence—is of extreme importance for maintaining peace. Freedom is the inherent right of every nation, and no one has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of any country. We must let the people of every country decide their own destiny. The hearts of the Indian people are connected with the hearts of all colonial peoples striving for freedom. Supporting the struggle of people around the world for liberation has always been a firm principle of our nation. We have always believed that as long as people in many parts of the world are enslaved by others, peace cannot be fully guaranteed.

The United Nations' attitude towards the issue of national independence has clearly demonstrated that it is being used to mask the force and power used by imperialist elements. Under the protection of the United Nations, millions of Korean people are being destroyed by the most barbaric weapons of war. The People's Republic of China is being denied entry into the United Nations simply because imperialist elements and war mongers fear the powerful voice of a united, new people. If members of the United Nations could visit the people's square in Beijing on October 1st, they would understand how powerful China is in the world. The atrocities in Malaya and Vietnam have not received the slightest attention in the United Nations because the colonial countries responsible for these atrocities, and the American government that strongly supports them, are unreasonably controlling the majority in this organization.

However, the national independence movement in the Asia-Pacific region is growing stronger day by day. The heroic struggles of the people of Vietnam and Malaya are receiving support from the people of other countries around the world. This makes the war mongers struggle even more desperately, taking out all the weapons in their armory to suppress these movements.

The war mongers are suppressing national liberation movements because, for the purpose of war, they want to use the raw materials and manpower of colonies and dependent countries. They need markets to dump goods, but not on the basis of mutual benefit, but in order to seize high profits and extract all the wealth of underdeveloped countries. The people of colonies and dependent countries demand freedom so that they can develop their motherland through peaceful construction. They need to establish industry and agriculture; they demand to develop education and culture; they want to live a happy and peaceful life. The war mongers do not allow them to do this, because the high profits they earn depend entirely on the exploitation of the colonial people. Imperialists need colonies because they need raw materials. They need war because they know that if there is peace in the world, they will lose their colonies.

The struggle of the people of the Asia-Pacific region for autonomy and national freedom is an inseparable part of the struggle for world peace. As long as imperialism and the colonial system exist, lasting peace is impossible. The success of the world peace movement is also a blow to imperialists, monopoly capitalists, and war mongers. If the desire of the people of the world for peaceful coexistence is realized—and there is no doubt that it will be realized—opportunities for exploitation and enslavement will be reduced, and soon imperialism itself will be eliminated.

Therefore, we should keep in mind the relationship between the struggle for national independence and peace. The world peace movement has consistently supported the heroic struggles of the people of Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, and also supports the arduous efforts of the people of the Near East and the Middle East for autonomy and independence. The peace movement has received increasing response from the people of the Asia-Pacific region in this regard. The participation of representatives from all these countries in this conference is a clear proof of this fact. They braved all kinds of hardships and overcame various obstacles to participate in this conference because they know that the world peace movement is also a movement for freedom and independence for people all over the world. Let us not disappoint their hopes. Let us now express our determination here that our efforts to defend peace and save peace will never lag behind.

The Indian peace movement has seen a lurking crisis. Imperialists and war mongers are doing their best to drag India into their efforts. They want to turn India into a springboard for their aggression in Southeast Asia, but the Indian people are quickly recognizing their sinister activities. The past tradition of the Indian people has always been to support the sacred cause of peace. They hate war and hate those who make war. At the same time, they love their own freedom and independence, and also love the freedom and independence of others. They have always given moral support to the warriors of other countries striving for freedom and independence. Therefore, they will never allow their own beloved motherland to become a base or transit station for imperialist forces. They will never tolerate those in their own country, whether they are big or small, directly or indirectly, spiritually or materially, aiding the war mongers. The Indian people will never forgive those executioners who slaughter men, women, and children.

India can play a very important role in this struggle for peace and against war. If India adopts a consistently clear policy of opposing war and war makers, if India expresses through its active actions its firm opposition to any nation exploiting and oppressing another nation, then peace in Asia can be guaranteed. And the achievement of peace in Asia will greatly advance the cause of world peace.

Therefore, the Indian peace movement is trying to mobilize all people, regardless of their political or social beliefs, to urge the Indian government to take a firm and clear stance on the issues of world peace and colonial exploitation. The Indian Prime Minister has consistently advocated allowing the People's Republic of China to join the United Nations. He opposed the proposal to cross the 38th parallel in Korea and condemned the bombing of the Yalu River area. Recently, the Indian National Congress appealed to the five major powers of the world, suggesting a peaceful resolution to their differences. The Indian people fervently hope that this appeal will be responded to as soon as possible.

The Indian people felt very shocked and horrified when they heard that some parts of India have long been used by the British government as recruiting grounds for Gurkha soldiers, who are sent to Malaya to massacre Malayan warriors striving for liberation. After this fact was confirmed, spontaneous voices of protest arose from all sides, and the Indian Prime Minister announced that he would try to stop the recruitment of Gurkha soldiers on Indian soil. The Indian peace movement, backed by the entire people, has been fighting for this matter, and we solemnly assure you that we will never relax our efforts until the recruitment of new soldiers in India is completely stopped, until no more facilities are given to Britain and France to transport soldiers and equipment through India.

The Indian peace movement will continue to mobilize more people to fight for world peace on the basis of the following points:

(1) Concluding a peace pact between the five major powers.
(2) Withdrawing foreign troops from all countries.
(3) Not allowing any foreign country to interfere in the internal affairs of a country.
(4) Ensuring the national independence of all countries in the world so that they can choose their own way of life with absolute freedom.
(5) Immediately stopping the Korean War on the basis of recognized international law.
(6) Resolving all disputes between India and Pakistan in a peaceful manner.

We, the members of the Indian delegation, represent different political views and ideas, but we are completely united on the demand for world peace and freedom. We have come here to work together with representatives from other countries at this conference on a noble task. We pay tribute to the people of Korea, Malaya, and Vietnam, and assure them that we will do our best to support their heroic struggle for peace and national liberation.

We express our respect to the Chinese people who have built a new world and are a beacon for all the people of the Asia-Pacific region. No one dares to disturb the peaceful life you are building. If anyone dares to do so, they will be crushed, because you have already united under the leadership of your glorious leader Chairman Mao Zedong.

United, we have strength. Disunited, we are weak. The united people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, India, and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region are able to defeat the conspiracies of the war mongers and establish peace and freedom throughout the world. Let us unite to do so.

Long live world freedom! (Xinhua News Agency)

### 民族独立与和平——印度代表高普兰在第三日会议上的发言

    民族独立与和平
    ——印度代表高普兰在第三日会议上的发言主席先生和朋友们：
    民族独立问题——真正的政治和经济独立——对维持和平是极端重要的。自由是每一个民族天生的权利，没有人有权去干涉任何一个国家的内政。我们必须让每一个国家的人民去决定他们自己的命运。印度人民的心是同一切争取自由的殖民地人民的心连接在一起的。拥护全世界人民争取解放的斗争一直是我们民族的坚定的原则。我们一直认为只要世界上还有很多地方的人民受着别人的奴役，和平是不能完全得到保障的。
    联合国对民族独立问题的态度已明白地说明了：它是被用来掩饰帝国主义分子所使用的武力和强权的。在联合国庇护之下，几百万的朝鲜人民正在被最野蛮的战争武器所毁灭着。中华人民共和国正被拒绝进入联合国，只因为帝国主义分子与战争贩子们惧怕一个团结的、新生的人民的强大的声音。假使联合国的会员们在十月一日到北京的人民的广场来一趟的话，他们就会懂得中国是世界上多么强大的力量。在马来亚和越南的暴行并没有在联合国中得到丝毫的注意，因为那些应对这些暴行负责的殖民国家与大力支持它们的美国政府，在这个机构中正不合理地控制着多数。
    可是亚洲及太平洋区域的民族独立运动正在一天天地壮大中。越南与马来亚人民的英勇斗争正受到世界其他各国人民的支援。这就使战争贩子们更加拚命挣扎，他们把他们军火库中的一切武器全拿出来镇压这些运动。
    战争贩子正在镇压民族解放运动，因为为了战争的目的，他们要利用殖民地与附属国家的原料和人力。他们要市场来倾销货物，但并不是在互利的基础上，而是为了夺取高额的利润与汲取未开发国家的全部财富。殖民地及附属国家的人民要求自由，以便能够通过和平建设来开发他们的祖国。他们需要建立工业与农业；要求发展教育和文化；他们要过愉快而和平的生活。战争贩子不让他们这样做，因为他们所赚得的高额利润是完全依靠对殖民地人民的剥削而来的。帝国主义者需要殖民地，因为他们需要原料。他们需要战争，因为他们知道，假如世界上有和平，他们将会失掉殖民地。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民争取自主和民族自由的斗争是世界和平斗争中分不开的一部分。只要帝国主义和殖民制度存在一天，永久的和平就不可能实现。世界和平运动的成功同时也就是对帝国主义者、独占资本家、战争贩子的一个打击。假如世界各国人民要求和平生存的热望得到实现——毫无疑问，一定将得到实现——剥削和奴役的机会就将减少，而且很快地，帝国主义本身也将被消灭。
    因此，我们应该牢记民族独立的斗争与和平之间的关系。世界和平运动一贯支持朝鲜、越南和马来亚人民的英勇斗争，也支持近东和中东各国人民为自主和独立而作的艰苦的努力。和平运动在这个方面已经得到亚洲及太平洋区域人民越来越大的响应。参加这个会议的有来自所有这些国家的代表，这就是对这个事实的一个明显的证明。他们冒着种种的艰苦，克服了各种的障碍，来参加这个会议，因为他们知道世界和平运动同时也就是全世界人民争取自由和独立的运动。我们不要辜负他们的希望吧。让我们现在在这里表示我们的决心，我们保卫和平和拯救和平的努力，决不会落在人家的后面。
    印度的和平运动已经看出了一个潜伏着的危机。帝国主义者和战争贩子们正在尽他们最大的努力，把印度卷入他们的努力中去。他们要把印度变成他们侵略东南亚的跳板，但是印度人民正在很快地认识到他们这种罪恶的活动。印度人民的过去的传统一直是拥护神圣的和平事业的。他们憎恨战争，憎恨制造战争的人们。同时，他们爱自己的自由和独立，也爱别人的自由和独立。他们一向对别的国家的争取自由和独立的战士，给以道义上的支持。因此他们决不会让他们自己的可爱的祖国变成帝国主义势力的基地或转运站。他们决不容忍他们本国那些人，不管他们是大人物还是小人物，直接或间接地，在精神上或物质上援助战争贩子。印度人民将永远不会饶恕那些屠杀男人、女人和儿童的刽子手们。
    印度在这一个和平与战争的斗争中是能够起十分重大的作用的。如果印度采取了始终一贯的明确的反对战争与战争制造者的政策，如果印度以它的积极行动表示它坚决反对任何一个民族剥削和压迫另一民族，那么，亚洲的和平是可以保证的。而亚洲的和平的取得将使世界和平事业大大地跨进一步。
    因此，印度的和平运动正在设法动员所有的人，不管他们的政治或社会信仰如何，督促印度政府采取坚定和明确的立场来对待世界和平与殖民地剥削的问题。印度总理一贯主张允许中华人民共和国加入联合国。他反对越过朝鲜三八线的建议，并斥责对鸭绿江地区施行轰炸的行为。最近印度国民大会曾经向世界五大国呼吁，建议和平解决他们之间的分歧。印度人民热烈地希望，这个呼吁能尽早地得到反应。
    印度人民感到非常的震骇和惊恐，当他们听到了印度有些地方长期以来被英国政府用作招募廓尔喀兵的募兵地，这些兵是开到马来亚去屠杀马来亚的争取解放的战士的。这个事实被证实以后，各方面都自发地响起了抗议的呼声，印度总理就宣布他要设法制止在印度的土地上招募廓尔喀兵的事。印度的和平运动，有着全体人民作后盾，一直在为这件事作斗争，我们严肃地向你们保证，我们决不放松我们的努力，一直到在印度招募新兵的事完全停止，一直到不再给予英国和法国运输兵士和装备过境的任何便利时为止。
    印度和平运动将继续动员更多的人民在下面几点的基础上来争取世界和平：
    （一）缔结五大国和平公约。
    （二）从一切国家撤退外国军队。
    （三）不许任何外国干涉一个国家的内政。
    （四）确保全世界一切国家的民族独立以便它们能绝对自由地选择它们自己的生活方式。
    （五）在公认的国际法规的基础上立即停止朝鲜战争。
    （六）以和平方式解决印度与巴基斯坦间的一切纠纷。
    我们，印度代表团的成员代表着不同的政治见解与思想，但是在要求世界和平与自由这一点上是完全一致的。我们到这里来与其他各国的代表们在这个会议上共同从事一桩崇高的工作。我们向朝鲜、马来亚和越南的人民致敬，并向他们保证：我们将尽我们最大的努力来支援他们的争取和平与民族解放的英勇斗争。
    我们向已经建立一个新的世界并且是亚洲及太平洋区域全体人民的灯塔的中国人民表示敬意。没有一个人敢于扰乱你们正在建立起来的和平生活。假如有人敢于这样做的话，他们一定要被粉碎的，因为你们已经在你们的光荣的领袖毛泽东主席的领导之下团结起来了。
    团结起来，我们就有力量。不团结，我们就软弱。苏联、中华人民共和国、印度和亚洲及太平洋区域其他国家的团结起来的人民，是能够击败战争贩子的阴谋，并在全世界建立起和平与自由的。让我们团结起来这样去做吧。
    世界自由万岁！（新华社）
