    Certain Grassroots Cooperatives in Longyou County Should Not Pay for Goods with Bounced Checks
    To the Editor:
    The Huzhen, Mohuan, Zhanjia, and three other grassroots cooperatives in Longyou County, Zhejiang Province, sometimes issue bounced checks when purchasing goods from the Longyou Branch of the state-owned department store. From October of last year until now, these cooperatives have issued a total of twelve bounced checks. On one occasion, the Zhanjia cooperative issued a bounced check for 5.12 million yuan. The Longyou branch recorded this check and submitted it, but after it was sent to the bank, it was discovered that the cooperative did not have that much inventory, which prevented the branch from completing its remittance task. This untrustworthy behavior on the part of the cooperative is completely wrong. We suggest that the Longyou County Cooperative strengthen its leadership over the accounting work of grassroots societies to prevent similar situations from happening again.

### 龙游县某些基层合作社不该以空头支票偿付货款

    龙游县某些基层合作社不该以空头支票偿付货款
    编辑同志：浙江龙游县湖镇、模环、詹家等六个基层合作社到国营百货公司龙游营业所买货，有时只开给空头支票。从去年十月到现在，这些合作社一共开了十二次空头支票。有一次，詹家合作社开了一张五百十二万元的空头支票，龙游营业所把这张支票入账上缴，送到银行以后，才发觉该社并没有这许多库存，以致该营业所不能完成上缴任务。该合作社这种不顾信用的行为是完全错误的。我们建议龙游县合作社加强对于基层社会计工作的领导，防止再发生类似情形。
