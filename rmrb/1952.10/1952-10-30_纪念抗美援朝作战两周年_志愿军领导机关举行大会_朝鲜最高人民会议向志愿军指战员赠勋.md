When talking about the current situation on the Korean battlefield, he said: The Korean war situation has been completely stabilized. In modern positional defense warfare, the Korean and Chinese people's forces can not only crush all enemy attacks, large and small, but also carry out powerful offensive counterattacks, continuously annihilating the enemy's effective strength. Like the Korean People's Army, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has become stronger and stronger in battle, its morale is even higher, its combat effectiveness has been greatly improved, its supply situation has been greatly improved, and various new arms have also been trained in actual combat, and have gained valuable experience in joint operations of various arms.
