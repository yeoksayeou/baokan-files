On that day, on this platform, the peace-loving mothers, sisters, and daughters of India expressed their respect to their Korean sisters and embraced them in friendship and affection. We were all deeply moved by this touching scene. Because that scene symbolized the emotions of all the people of our country—indeed, it symbolized the emotions of people all over the world, holding various opinions, towards the great and invincible Korean people.

I firmly believe that the silent message of peace exchanged between our Indian and Korean sisters, through the contact of their eyes, through their tears, will resonate again and again in every corner of the universe.

In this way, the air of the whole world is filled with the sound of peace. This sound must be loud and intense, so that those war-makers, murderers of innocent people, and profiteers from human blood will tremble. Then, one day, the despicable criminals will be isolated and brought to justice, just as we saw the heinous landlord in the great Chinese opera "The White Haired Girl" brought to trial.

Therefore, let us unite, regardless of nationality, color, race, and geographical differences, and work together for our common cause of peace. Is there any environment more free and comfortable for our cause than among the free and peaceful Chinese people, than in the great city of Beijing, where Chairman Mao Zedong, the brilliant creator of this new life, resides? The mere fact that we can gather in the People's China, in the city of Beijing, guarantees the success of our meeting.

Our 350 million people in India have not forgotten the horrors of war. Indeed, most of us have not experienced the direct disasters and destruction caused by large-scale bombing. But the last war brought us unprecedented horrors. The Bengal famine of 1943 starved three and a half million people to death. Everyone knows that these were all sacrifices to the hateful war demon. Heavy taxes, the squeeze of war bonds, and donations brought increasing suffering to India. This is why the Indian people are eagerly asking for peace.

I listened to the reports of all the representatives with deep concern. The facts they cited left me with no doubt about the unimaginable and inhuman atrocities that the desperate imperialist countries could commit in Korea, Malaya, Vietnam, and other countries. I trembled when I read the report of the International Scientific Commission on germ warfare. I was horrified when I finished reading the confessions of American prisoners of war about their evil plans to kill innocent men, women, and children, destroy crops, and poison drinking water.

Some people boast about the American "way of life." In my opinion, this "way of life" that serves a small group of profiteers by slaughtering a large group of people, this way of life that delights in the use of terrible napalm bombs and barbaric germ bombs, this "way of life" that sings praises to the atomic bomb and desperately continues to bomb innocent civilians, is nothing but a damned "way of life." It is barbarism, inhumanity, and an insult to humanity itself and human dignity. We must oppose, must victoriously oppose the implementation of this "way of life" throughout the world.

The World Peace Movement bears the great historical task of stopping war. The peace movement in India has also developed around the movement to strive for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. We have collected 2.5 million signatures for the peace declaration and hope to collect more in the future.

Several peace-loving people have done a brilliant job in collecting signatures in response to the World Peace Council's peace declaration, and they have brought glory to India. Let me read out their names so that we can jointly pay tribute to them:

	Bibi Dajjit Kaur, a young housewife, collected 60,000 signatures alone.
	Pastor Polarkason, a Christian pastor, collected 20,000 signatures among Christians.
	Rai Kumar Surapunsi, a journalist, collected 40,000 signatures.
	Santoshi Das, a student, collected 40,000 signatures.
	Danwant Singh, a student, collected 40,000 signatures.

This is the situation of the growing public opinion for peace in our country.

Today, when war is being waged on the soil of Asia and threatens most of us, I want to emphasize as much as possible that we Asian people ardently desire peace—immediate peace in Asia, and at the same time demand the immediate conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.

In the Indian Parliament and in the State Assemblies, many party leaders have put forward proposals and made speeches calling for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.

I fully agree with the views of the Indian representative, Mr. Gopalan, and his warm support for the heroic struggles of the people of Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and Japan against barbaric aggression and remilitarization. Although we are opposed to each other in the Parliament, we are engaged in a common cause in the peace movement.

I declare that the Indian people will never allow the Indian land, soaked in the blood of martyrs, to be used as a springboard for slaughtering the people of Korea, Malaya, and Vietnam and as a recruiting station for aggression. Let me assure you that we Indian people, despite party differences and differences of opinion, will continue to work for peace and will always be ready to serve this cause.

### 印度代表、印度国会议员及波保尔邦国大党主席  查图尔·纳拉英·马拉维亚的发言（摘要）

    印度代表、印度国会议员及波保尔邦国大党主席
    查图尔·纳拉英·马拉维亚的发言（摘要）
    那一天，在这个讲台上，印度爱好和平的母亲，姐妹和女儿向她们朝鲜姐妹们表示敬爱之意，并且在友谊和挚爱之中拥抱她们，我们看到了这动人的场面，都深深受到感动。因为那一个场面象征着我国全体人民的情感——事实上，也象征着全世界抱着各种见解的人民，对伟大和不可战胜的朝鲜人民的情感。
    我深信，我们印度与朝鲜的姐妹们在她们相互之间，通过他们视线的接触，通过她们的眼泪所交流着的默默的和平信息，将要在宇宙的每一个角落里，一再引起回响。
    这样，全世界的空气中都充满了和平的声音。这个声音必须要响亮而紧张，使得那些战争制造者、无辜人民的屠杀者和从人类鲜血中取利的人不寒而栗。那末，总有一天，卑鄙的罪犯会被孤立起来，并且被交付审判，就像我们所看到中国人民的伟大歌剧“白毛女”中的可恶地主受到审判一样。
    因此，让我们团结起来，不问国籍、肤色、种族、以及地域上的区别，为我们共同的和平事业而共同努力。还有哪一个环境，对我们的事业，比在自由与和平的中国人民当中，比在这个新的生活的光辉创造者毛泽东主席所居住的伟大北京城中，来得更自由、更适意呢。我们能够在人民的中国，在北京城相聚，仅仅这样一个事实，就可以保证我们会议的成功。
    我们印度三亿五千万人民并没有淡忘战争的恐怖。的确，我们大多数人都没有经历过由大规模轰炸而引起的直接灾难与破坏。但是上次战争却给我们带来了前所未闻的恐怖。一九四三年的孟加拉饥荒饿死了三百五十万人。每一个人都知道这些都是可恨的战争恶魔的牺牲品。重税、战争公债的压榨和捐款给印度带来了日益加剧的苦难。这就是印度人民热切要求和平的原因。
    我以深切的关怀倾听着所有代表们的报告。他们所列举的事实，使我对于绝望的帝国主义国家在朝鲜、马来亚、越南以及其他国家可干的无从想像和灭绝人性的暴行丝毫无所怀疑。当我读到国际科学委员会关于细菌战的报告书时，我感到战栗。当我看完美国战俘供认出杀害无辜的男女和儿童，损毁农作物和在饮水里下毒的凶恶计划时，我感到恐怖。
    有些人夸耀美国的“生活方式”。在我看来，这种以屠杀一大群人而替一小撮唯利是图的人效劳的“生活方式”，这种以使用可怕的凝固汽油弹和野蛮的细菌弹为乐的生活方式，这种向原子弹唱赞美诗和拚命对无辜平民继续滥施轰炸的“生活方式”，不过是一种该死的“生活方式”。这是野蛮，是无人性、是对人类本身和人类尊严的侮辱。我们必须反对，必须胜利地反对将这种“生活方式”施行于全世界。
    世界和平运动担负着制止战争的伟大历史任务。印度的和平运动，也已在环绕着争取缔结五大国和平公约的运动发展起来。我们已经收集了二百五十万个和平宣言的签名，并且希望今后能够收集更多的签名。
    有几位爱好和平的人士，在征集响应世界和平理事会和平宣言的签名方面完成了辉煌的工作，他们为印度增光不少。让我把他们的名字念出来，以便我们共同向他们致敬：
    比比·达吉特·考尔，青年主妇，单独征集了六万个签名。
    泼拉开森牧师，基督教牧师，在基督教徒中征集了两万个签名。
    拉伊·库玛尔·苏拉朋西，新闻工作者，征集了四万个签名。
    散托希·达斯，学生，征集了四万个签名。
    丹望特·辛格，学生，征集了四万个签名。
    这就是我们国家里要求和平的民意不断增长的情形。
    今天，战争在亚洲的土地上进行着并且威胁着我们大多数人的时候，我要尽力强调说：我们亚洲人民万分热烈地渴望和平——在亚洲立即实现和平，同时要求立即缔结五大国和平公约。
    在印度国会里，在邦议会里，许多政党领袖都提出提案，并发表演说，要求缔结五大国和平公约。
    我完全同意印度代表高普兰先生的意见和他对朝鲜、越南、马来亚和日本的人民反对野蛮侵略和重新军国主义化的英勇斗争的热烈支持。虽然我们在国会里是互相对立的，但是在和平运动中我们一起从事共同的事业。
    我宣布印度人民永不允许浸透了烈士鲜血的印度土地用作屠杀朝鲜、马来亚以及越南人民的跳板和侵略的招兵站。让我向你们保证，我们印度人民，尽管党派不同，意见分歧，但是将继续努力争取和平，并将随时准备着为这一事业服务。                （新华社）
