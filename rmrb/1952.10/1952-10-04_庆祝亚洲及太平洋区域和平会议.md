    World Peace Council Member and Renowned American Peace Activist Paul Robeson's Congratulatory Message
    World Peace Council member and renowned American peace activist Paul Robeson wrote an article congratulating the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Robeson said:
    Across the weak barrier erected between you and me by Washington's war-minded men, I raise my head and extend to you brotherly congratulations!
    To you, the finest representatives of the great Asian people—heirs to a long and sublime culture, a heroic and victorious people—I send the proud assurance of the unbreakable solidarity of the peace-loving people of America. We are determined that your peace conference shall hear the true voice of America, the voice of the people, united with yours in the call for peace.
    This voice is bound to gather the force of a worldwide storm. It is bound to sweep away the evil forces that fill the world with paralyzing fear of war. It is bound to restrain those who have committed the most brutal war crimes against many of you attending the conference—those of you from Korea, Malaya, and Vietnam—from their atrocities.
    With extreme shame and anger, I join you and all humanity-minded men and women in demanding that the U.S. government immediately cease its unspeakable crimes of germ warfare and, in accordance with international conventions, ban this barbaric weapon, without further evasion.
    In order to overthrow the enduringly resisting Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the U.S. government, violating the democratic traditions of the American people, is supplying its vassal French imperialists with money and war materials, even at the cost of employing the latest large-scale killing tools.
    It is the greed of American monopoly capitalists and their dream of world domination that supports the British colonial army in waging a brutal war against the people of the rich Malay Peninsula. The people of Malaya, like their Indochinese brothers, have bravely embarked on the path to independence, the path pioneered by American patriots in 1776.
    The people of Indochina, Malaya, and Vietnam can be assured that their just cause will certainly not lack support in America. Our American peace movement will certainly and simultaneously spread the startling and hopeful deeds of the awakened East to an increasingly wider audience. We will certainly and also strive to move the American people to action for peace and friendship with the people of Asia.
    Since the atrocity of dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the arrogant face of the West has never been more shamefully displayed than in war-ravaged but still heroic Korea. American troops have been instructed to act against the interests of their own people and the peace-loving will expressed by the American people, conducting indiscriminate massacres of the Korean people, regardless of age or gender, burning them alive in their factories and estates with ignited gasoline.
    Every day, new evidence proves that what the U.S. military commanders say at the protracted armistice talks is not enough to represent the American people. The deceitful and hypocritical so-called "voluntary" repatriation does not resonate genuinely in the hearts of American mothers. On the contrary, they pray day and night to see their sons again. The American peace movement has a responsibility to turn this prayer into a definite and firm call: "Send our boys home!"
    The American Peace Crusade, representing the well-known desires of the American people, demands that our government work for an immediate ceasefire and a full truce, leaving all unresolved issues to be resolved at a peace conference.
    The American Peace Crusade has called on the people to sign petitions demanding consultation between major Eastern and Western powers to reverse the trend towards world war and to relieve the people of the unbearable burden of expanding armaments. To date, we have collected nearly one million signatures, and we believe that this is only a symbol of the task we must and can accomplish. In the current presidential campaign, the American Peace Crusade is launching a nationwide poll to demand an end to the Korean War now. Before the November election, we will also submit this demand to the main candidates in the election, with the votes of millions of citizens as our backing. We are confident in undertaking this task because other groups and people from all walks of life—labor unions, religious, educational, scientific, artistic, and business circles—are either working with us or acting independently.
    Please allow me to pay special tribute to the Chinese delegates. The outstanding Chinese nation you represent has, through arduous struggle and heroic sacrifice, liberated the vast people of your homeland.
    Your ancestors pioneered the path of modern civilization, and you are now embarking on the road to higher social organizations and cultural forms. On this great path before you, your forever faithful friends, the mighty Soviet people, have cleared the way and marched forward; and the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe are also advancing alongside you.
    The standing Asian people follow your great strides, you point the way for them, holding the torch. I congratulate you on your achievements and support your determination to move unwaveringly towards your destination. I believe that your country and our country, along with other countries with different systems and developing along different routes, can and must become friends. The American people are tired of the waste of vast wars. When we create infinitely bright prospects for humanity, you and we, hand in hand, united as one, working, building, and singing together, can and must establish lasting peace between East and West.

    World Peace Council Member and President of the Italian Supreme Court, Sabelli's Congratulatory Telegram
    World Peace Council member and President of the Italian Supreme Court, Sabelli, sent a telegram congratulating the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The telegram reads: Embracing a passion for humanity, we warmly welcome the upcoming conferences in Beijing and Vienna, and we unconditionally and wholeheartedly support the holding of these two conferences, which are essentially one conference. Their common goal is to block the road to a new world war that threatens us.
    The telegram points out: The road to a third world war starts from the United States, not from the people, because the people of every country love peace. This road originates from a small number of industrial and financial tycoons who attempt to continuously expand their transcendental power of monopoly in the world. This road, extending from two opposite directions, leads to the gates of China and Germany. Therefore, our responsibility is to emphasize stopping the Korean War and striving for the peaceful reunification of Germany.
    Conversely, the road to peace does not start from this or that country, but from all countries on earth, from all the world's people who are immersed in their labor and work, wholeheartedly wanting to improve their free and peaceful lives with this work.
    We must make these many roads reach one end, reaching the goal pointed out and prepared by the millions of victims of the two brutal world wars, we must make these roads advance towards the goal of the United Nations. The United Nations must always be a truly independent, impartial, and able to respect the free and equal rights of national self-determination and non-interference in internal affairs organization, just as the original intention of the initiators of the United Nations organization and as stipulated in the United Nations Charter. However, the Korean War has cast a shadow on the work of the United Nations. This war is contrary to the original mission of the United Nations.
    The telegram concludes: Friends, move forward forever, against the warmongers, against the powerful toxins left over from the dark past. (Xinhua News Agency)

    庆祝亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    世界和平理事会理事、美国著名和平人士罗伯逊的贺词
    世界和平理事会理事、美国著名和平人士罗伯逊撰文祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。罗伯逊说：
    越过华盛顿的一心想战争的人在我和你们之间筑起的薄弱的藩篱，我抬起头来，并伸手向你们致以兄弟的祝贺！
    你们伟大亚洲人民最优秀的代表——悠久和崇高文化的继承者，英勇和胜利的人民，我给你们寄去美国爱好和平人民牢不可破的团结的骄傲保证。我们决心要使你们的和平会议听到真正的美国声音，这是人民的呼声，和你们一致发出的争取和平的呼声。
    这个声音必定会把全世界的暴风雨似的力量汇集起来。它必定会扫除那使全世界充满令人瘫痪的战争恐惧的恶势力。它必定会制止对你们出席会议的许多人——你们来自朝鲜、马来亚、越南的人们——犯下了最残酷的战争罪行的那些人，不许他们逞凶。
    我以极度惭愧与愤怒的心情，和你们以及全世界主张人道的男女共同要求美国政府：立即停止不堪言状的细菌战罪行，并且遵照国际公约禁用这种野蛮武器，不得再行推脱。
    为了要推翻那持久抗战的越南民主共和国，美国政府违反了美国人民的民主传统，正以金钱及战争物资供给它的仆从法帝国主义者，甚至不惜运用最新式的大规模屠杀的工具。
    也就是美国垄断资本家的那种贪欲和企图统治全世界的迷梦，支持着英国殖民军队对富庶的马来半岛上的人民，进行残酷的战争。马来亚的人民，就像他们印度支那的兄弟一样，已经勇敢地踏上争取独立的道路，这是美国的爱国者在一七七六年所开辟的道路。
    印度支那、马来亚、越南的人民可以相信：他们的正义事业在美国一定不会没有人支持的。我们美国的和平运动一定而且同时也会把觉醒了的东方的惊人的和充满希望的事迹，传布到日益广大的人们中去。我们一定而且也会争取美国人民为和平及与亚洲人民友好而行动起来。
    自从在广岛投掷原子弹的暴行发生以来，西方的带着骄横气焰的嘴脸，再也没有比在饱受摧残、但却仍然英勇的朝鲜那里显现得更为可耻的了。美国的军队被指示着违背本国人民的利益和美国人民所表露的爱好和平的意志，对朝鲜人民进行了不分老幼男女、不分情况的大屠杀，用点燃着的汽油把朝鲜人民活活地烧死在他们的工厂和庄园里。
    每天都有新的证据证明：美军司令官在拖延着的停战谈判会议上所说的话，并不足以代表美国的人民。欺人的和伪善的所谓“自愿”遣返，在美国母亲们的心里是得不到真正的反响的。相反地，她们日夜祈望能够再看到她们的儿子们。美国和平运动有责任把这种祈望变成一个肯定而坚决的呼声：“把我们的孩子送回家来！”
    美国和平十字军，代表美国人民的众所共知的愿望，要求我们政府为立即停火与全面休战而努力，把一切到现在尚未解决的问题留待和平会议席上去解决。
    美国和平十字军已经号召人民在请愿书上签名，要求东方西方各大国间进行协商，扭转导向世界大战的趋势，并解除人民所不堪负荷的扩张军备的重担。到目前为止我们已征集到几乎一百万人的签名，而我们认为这不过是我们必须并且能够完成的任务的一种象征而已。在目前总统竞选中，美国和平十字军正在发动一个全国性的民意测验，要求现在就结束朝鲜战争。在十一月大选前我们还要把这个要求提交给竞选的主要候选人，我们有成百万公民的选票来做我们的后盾。我们担负起这个任务很有信心，因为其他团体和社会各界人士——工会、宗教、教育、科学、艺术与工商界人士，正在或者与我们共同努力或者独立地行动起来。
    请允许我向中国代表们致以特别的敬意。你们所代表的杰出的中华民族业已通过艰巨的奋斗和英勇的牺牲，解放了你们祖国大陆上的广大人民。
    你们的祖先开辟了现代文明的途径，而你们现在又已踏上了走向更高的社会组织和文化形式的道路。在你们面前这条伟大的道路上，你们的永远忠实的朋友、强大的苏联人民，曾经披荆斩棘，向前迈进；而东欧的人民民主国家也在和你们并肩前进。
    站起来的亚洲人民跟随着你们大踏步前进，你们为他们指出道路，擎着火炬。我祝贺你们的成就，并支持你们的毫不迟疑地向目的地前进的决心。我相信你们的国家和我们的国家，与其他不同体制及沿着不同路线发展的国家是能够而且必须成为朋友的。美国人民对于浪费浩大的战争是厌倦的。当我们为人类创造无限远大的前途的时候，你们和我们手牵着手、万众一心，共同工作、建设和歌唱，是能够而且必须建立起东方和西方的持久和平的。

    世界和平理事会理事、意大利最高法院院长萨维利奥·勃立甘特的贺电
    世界和平理事会理事、意大利最高法院院长萨维利奥·勃立甘特致电祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。电文说：我们怀抱着对人类的热情，我们热烈地迎接即将召开的北京和维也纳的会议，我们无条件地衷心赞助这两个会议的举行，这两个会议其实就是一个会议。它们的共同目的就是堵塞威胁着我们的新世界战争的道路。
    电文指出：走向第三次世界大战的道路是从美国出发的，而不是从人民出发的，无论那个国家的人民都是爱好和平的。这个道路由少数的工业与金融界的大亨们那里出发，这些大亨们企图不断发展他们在世界上垄断的超然权力。这条由两个相反的方向伸展出去的道路通到中国和德国的门户。因此我们的责任是要强调停止朝鲜战争，争取德国的和平统一。
    反之，和平的道路不是由这个或那个国家出发的，而是由地球上的所有国家出发的，由所有埋头在他们的劳动工作里而一心想用这种工作改善他们自由和安静的生活的世界人民出发的。
    我们要使这许多道路达到一个终点，达到两次残酷的世界大战的千百万牺牲者所指出的、所准备好的目标，我们要使这些道路通向联合国的目标前进。联合国必须始终是真正独立的、公正无私、能尊重各民族自决的自由平等权利以及不干涉内政的组织，就如同联合国组织的发起人原来的意旨和联合国宪章中所规定的一样。但是，朝鲜战争给联合国的工作投下了一个暗影。这个战争是与联合国原来的使命相抵触的。
    电文最后说：朋友们，永远前进，反对战争贩子，反对暗澹的过去时代所遗留下来的强有力的毒素。    （新华社）
