    What to Learn from the Experience of the Agricultural Production Increase Movement in Zhaoyuan County

    After reading several articles published in this newspaper on October 18 about the experiences of Zhaoyuan County's patriotic agricultural production increase movement this year, some people are very excited on the one hand, and somewhat doubtful on the other. They say: Zhaoyuan County promoted the farming method of "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning seedlings, and protecting seedlings," which enabled the yield of nearly 10,000 hectares of high-yield fields to increase by an average of one to two times. This is because their original farming methods were too extensive; the farmers in our area already pay attention to these things, so what should we do to increase production further?

    Zhaoyuan County's experience in farming techniques can naturally only be suitable for areas with extensive farming practices. However, Zhaoyuan County's experience also has other more important significance that is worth learning from carefully in various places.

    The main experience of Zhaoyuan County in achieving large-scale production increase is to realistically identify the key to increasing production locally and to identify the most decisive production potential. The main contradiction in Zhaoyuan County's current agricultural production increase is that there is more land but too few and uneven seedlings. This problem seems very ordinary and small, but it is indeed the most important and weakest link in the local agricultural production increase. Zhaoyuan County broke through this link and achieved a great victory. How to discover this central link? There are no particularly clever tricks, just truly go deep into the masses and connect with reality. The grain yields of the farmers vary, sometimes high and sometimes low. Ren Guodong, secretary of the Zhaoyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, went deep into the countryside, conducted investigations and comparisons, and calculated detailed accounts and made analyses with the masses, and found the main reason.

    Zhaoyuan County's experience in increasing production also has points for everyone to learn from, which is to immediately rely on mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives to concentrate efforts to promote it to the masses after finding a way to increase production: use concrete examples, calculate detailed accounts, explain the reasoning, break down conservative ideas; patiently help the masses overcome the difficulties of using new methods (such as mobilizing women to participate in production to solve the problem of insufficient labor), and make the production increase movement truly a mass movement.

    The leading cadres of Zhaoyuan County seriously implemented the working method of coming from the masses and going to the masses, and used the ideological method of starting from reality and grasping the main contradictions, and achieved great results. Some cadres who lead agricultural production are ambitious and eager to make a name for themselves, unwilling to go deep into the masses and summarize "ordinary" and "small" experiences, which is obviously wrong. Some people only pay attention to cultivating a few "typical examples," turning a blind eye to the widespread problems, or are satisfied with summarizing typical experiences but do not pay attention to promotion, which is also wrong. The experience of Zhaoyuan County in leading the patriotic agricultural production increase movement will be of great benefit to various regions, and there is no doubt about this.

### 从肇源县农业增产运动的经验中学习些什么

    从肇源县农业增产运动的经验中学习些什么
    有些人看了本报十月十八日发表的几篇关于肇源县今年农业爱国增产运动经验的文章，一方面非常兴奋，一方面又有些怀疑。他们说：肇源县推广了“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗”的耕作方法，就使全县近万垧丰产田的产量，平均提高了一倍到两倍，这是因为他们那里原来的耕作方法太粗放；我们这里的农民本来就注意这些事情，再要增产该怎么办呢？
    肇源县在耕作技术方面的经验，自然只能适合于耕作粗放的地区。但是，肇源县的经验还有其他方面的更加重要的意义，值得各地认真学习。
    实事求是地找出当地增加生产的关键，找出最有决定意义的生产潜在力，这是肇源县能够获得大面积增产的主要经验。肇源县目前农业增产中的主要矛盾是土地较多，禾苗太少，而且不匀。这个问题看起来是很平凡、很细小的，但它确实是当地农业增产中最主要而又最薄弱的一环。肇源县突破了这一环，就取得了巨大的胜利。怎样发现这种中心环节呢？没有什么特别巧妙的窍门，真正深入群众、联系实际就行了。农民群众的粮食产量有的高，有的低，有时高，有时低，中共肇源县委书记任国栋同志深入农村，进行调查比较，和群众一起算了细账，作了分析，就把主要原因找出来了。
    肇源县的增产经验，还有可供大家学习的地方，这就是把增产办法找出来以后，立即依靠互助组和农业生产合作社，集中力量把它推广到群众中去：用具体事例，算细账，讲道理，打破保守思想；耐心地帮助群众克服使用新方法的困难（如发动妇女参加生产，解决人力不足的困难），使增产运动真正成为群众性的运动。
    肇源县的领导干部，认真地实行了从群众中来，到群众中去的工作方法，运用了从实际出发，抓主要矛盾的思想方法，获得了很大的成绩。有些领导农业生产的干部，好高骛远，企图一鸣惊人，不愿深入群众，总结“平凡”的“细小”的经验，显然是错误的。有些人只注意培养少数“典型”，对于普遍存在的问题视而不见，或满足于总结典型经验而不注意推广，也是错误的。肇源县领导农业爱国增产运动的经验，对各个地区，都会有很大的益处，这是毫无疑义的。
