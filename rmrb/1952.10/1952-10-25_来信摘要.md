A Large Number of Road Construction Machines Abandoned in Fengxian County - East China Ministry of Transportation Should Promptly Take Responsibility for Handling Them

Recently, I went to work in Fengxian County, Southern Jiangsu. In an open space near the highway in Shaqi Township, I discovered a batch of road construction machines, including eleven bulldozers, one soil compactor, and three earthmovers with large iron buckets. In addition, there were two large iron rollers covered with dense iron spikes, one iron comb, and three large iron barrels. These machines have been abandoned in the weeds, and no one cares about them. As a result, several tires have been taken away, and some tires have been partially cut off.

According to local cadres, these machines were left behind when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang retreated. At that time, the machines were relatively complete, with only a few parts dismantled. Liu Boying, the secretary of the Fengxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, told me that in 1950, the Fengxian County People's Government reported this situation to the East China Military and Political Committee, requesting relevant departments to handle these machines; however, there has been no result. The local people also have strong opinions about this situation. They said:

"Even with a year of patriotic production increase, we can't afford to buy these machines!" "Why not repair these machines and use them for national construction? Even if they can't be repaired, taking this steel to make other machines is better than leaving them here to rust in the rain!"

I believe that the opinions of the people are completely correct. Such behavior of not cherishing national resources cannot be allowed. I suggest that the East China Military and Political Committee's Ministry of Transportation promptly and responsibly handle these machines and use them for the construction of the motherland.

Central Bureau of Technical Affairs Should Not Accumulate People's Inventions for a Long Time Without Reviewing Them

The Central Bureau of Technical Affairs should not accumulate my application for review of the invention of a "high-speed Chinese typewriter" for a long time without processing it. Last October, I sent the plan and drawings of the "high-speed Chinese typewriter" that I had been researching for many years to the Central Bureau of Technical Affairs for review. In early November, the bureau issued me a "Notice of Acceptance for Review," but there has been no follow-up since then. In February of this year, I urged them once, and the Central Bureau of Technical Affairs replied that the Invention Review Committee had just been organized and all inventions would be reviewed successively. I would be notified after the results were available. I waited patiently again, and now it has been more than ten months, but there are still no results. I believe that the Central Bureau of Technical Affairs is wrong to accumulate people's inventions for a long time without reviewing them. I hope you will urge them to pay attention to the review work so that the creative enthusiasm of the people can be encouraged as it should be. Liu Shun

Editor's note: Encouraging the people to engage in inventions and creations related to production is of great significance to the national economic construction. The Government Administration Council stipulated in the "Provisional Regulations on the Protection of Invention Rights and Patent Rights": After accepting the inventor's application, the central competent authority "should complete the review and notify the applicant within three months," "except for special inventions that require a longer period of research and review." The situation that the Central Bureau of Technical Affairs accumulates people's inventions for a long time without reviewing them will affect the creative enthusiasm of the people. This situation should be changed quickly.

Northeast Timber Factory of the Ministry of Railways Should Improve Timber Supply Work

I am a staff member of the Materials Department of the Tianjin Railway Bureau. The Northeast Timber Factory of the Ministry of Railways and other units do not supply timber according to our department's production needs, resulting in situations of using large materials for small purposes, work stoppages awaiting materials, or accumulation and waste. Most of the timber we apply for is three meters, five meters, and six meters long, with only a few being four meters long. However, most of the timber allocated is four meters long. In this way, when three-meter timber is needed, the four-meter timber has to be sawn short; projects that require five-meter or six-meter timber have to stop work and wait for materials. For example, our department does not urgently need sleepers at present, and we have notified the Northeast Timber Factory of this situation; however, the factory recently allocated a large batch of sleepers to us. In this way, on the one hand, a large amount of funds are accumulated, and on the other hand, we have nowhere to store them, causing difficulties in unloading and wasting storage costs. In addition, many of the timber allocated by the factory are rotten and unusable, which is also a great waste of transportation capacity. In order to avoid the loss of national resources, I hope that the Northeast Timber Factory of the Ministry of Railways will promptly correct the above errors. Yan Runde

The Ministry of Construction Engineering of the Central People's Government is Preparing to Rotate Training for Cadres in Basic Construction Work

Basic construction work is an important part of national construction work. However, at present, most of the comrades in enterprise departments responsible for basic construction work are "laymen" to this work, and their professional level is poor. This is one of the important reasons for the waste and loss that occurred in the past work. In order to avoid the loss of national resources in the future, I suggest that relevant departments establish a basic construction training class to specially train and cultivate cadres in various enterprise departments responsible for basic construction work, so that the basic construction work in the future can be done better. Qiu Feng

Editor's note: The Ministry of Construction Engineering of the Central People's Government agrees with the suggestion of reader Qiu Feng. In order to welcome the large-scale economic construction of the motherland, vigorously improve the professional level of cadres responsible for basic construction work, so that they can change from "laymen" to "experts," and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the Ministry of Construction Engineering is preparing to set up a construction engineering school to rotate and transfer construction cadres from various departments to the school for study. The specific methods are currently being studied.

Yingkou County Xinhua Bookstore Goes Deep into Companies to Supply Books and Periodicals

I am a cultural instructor in a company of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The soldiers in our company have just completed intensive literacy training and are beginning to enter the stage of reading and writing. Everyone is very eager to read new books. On September 8, the service staff of the Yingkou County Xinhua Bookstore in Liaodong Province brought a batch of popular books and periodicals to our company. The soldiers were eating lunch. As soon as the instructor announced the news, many comrades couldn't wait to eat their lunch and ran to buy books. The place to buy books was as lively as a fair, with eight tables surrounded by people. The three books "Gao Yu Bao Learns Culture," "How to Write Manuscripts," and "How to Write" were snapped up before they were even displayed properly. In less than an hour, a total of three hundred and several dozen books were sold. When the comrades from the Xinhua Bookstore left, the soldiers were still reluctant to leave and asked them when they would come again.

The book and periodical distribution institutions go deep into the companies to supply books and periodicals, which is of great help to the cultural learning of the troops. It is suggested that Xinhua Bookstores in various places can do this. Xiong Zhengqing

    来信摘要
    奉贤境内弃置大批筑路机器华东交通部应迅速负责处理
    我最近到苏南奉贤县工作，在砂碛乡公路附近的空坪上发现有一批筑路用的机器，计有推土机十一架、压土机一架和装有大铁斗的铲土机三架，此外还有密布铁刺的大铁滚二个、铁梳一个和大铁桶三个。这批机器弃置草丛中，无人过问，以致有好几个轮胎被人取走，有些轮胎已被人割掉了一部分。
    据当地干部告诉我：这批机器是蒋介石匪帮溃退时留下的，当时机器还比较完整，只被拆掉了一些零件。中共奉贤县委书记刘伯英告诉我：一九五○年，奉贤县人民政府曾把这个情况呈报华东军政委员会，请有关部门处理这批机器；但却一直没有结果。当地群众对这个情况也很有意见。他们说：
    “我们爱国增产一年，还买不到这些机器呢！”“为什么不把这批机器修理好，用在国家建设上呢？就是不能修理，把这些钢铁拿去造别的机器也比放在这里让雨水淋锈强啊！”
    我认为，群众的意见是完全正确的。这种不爱护国家资材的行为是不能允许的。建议华东军政委员会交通部迅速负责地处理这批机器，把它们用之于祖国的建设事业。　苏南日报记者　董国平
    中央技术管理局不该积压群众发明长期不作审查
    中央技术管理局不该对我申请审查的“高速中文打字机”的发明长期积压不处理。去年十月，我把多年来研究的“高速中文打字机”的计划和图样送请中央技术管理局审查。十一月初，该局发给我一份“接受审查通知书”，但以后就一直没有下文了。今年二月，我催了一次，中央技术管理局答复我说，发明审查委员会甫经组织就绪，所有发明将陆续审查。待有结果后即可通知我。我又耐心地等，到现在已经十个多月了，但却仍无结果。我认为：中央技术管理局长期积压群众的发明不作审查是错误的。希望你们督促他们重视审查工作，以便使群众的创造热情得到应有的鼓励。刘顺
    编者按：鼓励群众从事有关生产的发明创造，对国家经济建设事业有重大的意义。政务院在“保障发明权与专利权暂行条例”中规定：中央主管机关在接受发明者的申请后，“除特殊发明须经较长时期研究审查者外”，“应于三个月内审查完毕通知申请人”。中央技术管理局积压群众的发明，长期不作审查的情况将会影响群众的创造热情。这种情况应该迅速改变。
    铁道部东北木材厂应该改进木材供应工作
    我是天津铁路局材料处的工作人员。铁道部东北木材厂等单位不按照我处生产需要供应木材，以致造成大材小用、停工待料或积压浪费的情况。我们申请拨给的木材大部是三公尺、五公尺和六公尺的，只有少数是四公尺的。但拨来的木材却大部是四公尺的。这样，要用三公尺的木材时就得把四公尺的木材锯短；需用五公尺或六公尺木材的工程就得停工待料。又如我处目前不急需枕木，并已将情况通知东北木材厂；但该厂最近还拨给我们大批枕木。这样，一方面积压了大批资金，另一方面我们无处存放，造成卸车困难和浪费保管费用。此外，该厂所拨木材很多是腐朽不能使用的，这在运输力上也是一个很大的浪费。为了避免国家资材的损失，希望铁道部东北木材厂及时纠正上述错误。   严润德
    中央人民政府建筑工程部准备轮训基本建设工作的干部
    基本建设工作是国家建设工作中的一个重要部分。但是目前大部分企业部门负责基本建设工作的同志对该项工作是“外行”，业务水平差，这是过去工作中发生浪费和损失的重要原因之一。为了避免今后国家资材的损失，我建议有关部门成立一个基本建设训练班，专门训练、培养各企业部门负责基本建设工作的干部，使今后的基本建设工作做得更好。　秋枫
    编者按：中央人民政府建筑工程部同意读者秋枫的建议。为了迎接祖国大规模的经济建设，大力提高负责基本建设工作干部的业务水平，使他们由“外行”变为“内行”，并很好学习苏联先进经验，建筑工程部准备筹设一个建筑工程学校，轮流抽调各部门建筑工作干部入校学习。具体办法现在正在研究中。
    营口县新华书店深入连队供应书刊
    我是中国人民解放军某连的文化教员。我们连队的战士现在刚突击完生字，开始进入阅读写话阶段。大家非常迫切要求阅读新书。九月八日，辽东省营口县新华书店的服务员带了一批通俗书刊到我们连队来。战士们正在吃午饭，指导员把这个消息一宣布，好些同志顾不得吃饭就跑去买书了。买书的地方就像赶集一样热闹，八张棹子围得满满的。“高玉宝学文化”、“怎样写稿”、“怎样写作”这三种书还没有摆好就被抢购完了。不到一点钟的时间，总共就卖了三百几十本书。新华书店的同志临走时，战士们还依依不舍，连声问他们什么时候再来。
    书刊发行机构深入连队供应书刊，对部队文化学习有很大的帮助。建议各地新华书店都能这样做。熊正清
