    The track-laying project for the rebuilt section of the Jinzhou-Chengde Railway, from Jinlingsi in Rehe Province in the north to Chengde in the south, a total length of 340 kilometers, has been completed one month ahead of schedule. All engineering team members participating in the construction are now rushing to build auxiliary projects such as train stations in order to strive for formal opening to traffic as soon as possible. In 1945, when the Kuomintang bandit troops attacked the liberated areas, they destroyed the Jin-Cheng Railway, completely destroying all lines and bridges in the section from Jinlingsi to Chengde. As a result, local material exchanges were restricted, and the improvement of people's production and lives was affected.
    In order to prosper the people's economy of Rehe Province and develop the local buried resources, the People's Government began to rebuild the Jin-Cheng Railway in March this year. In order to strengthen the leadership of this project, the Chinese Communist Party Rehe Provincial Committee not only equipped the road construction team with a large number of political work cadres, but also mobilized more than 4,000 residents along the railway to form a civilian labor team to help more than 3,000 railway workers lay tracks.
    Since the rebuilt section of the Jin-Cheng Railway has been opened to traffic section by section and informal transportation business has begun, the economic life of the people of Rehe Province has begun to improve. The Rehe Provincial Department of Commerce has readjusted the prices of 21 kinds of industrial products. For example, glass that used to sell for 140,000 yuan per box in Shenyang would sell for 240,900 yuan when transported to Chengde, but now it has been reduced to 140,900 yuan. The price difference between one catty of sugar in Shenyang and Chengde has dropped from 9.2 percent to 3.3 percent. The reduction in the price of industrial products has also relatively increased the purchasing power of the people of Rehe Province. According to statistics from the Rehe Provincial Department of Commerce, sales in August increased by 79.4 percent compared with July. Velvet sweaters, women's socks, children's toys, etc., which were unsalable in the past, are now in short supply. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 锦承铁路重建部分铺轨工程提前完工

    锦承铁路重建部分铺轨工程提前完工
    锦（州）承（德）铁路的重建部分——北起热河省的金岭寺、南至承德，全长三百四十公里的铺轨工程，已提前一个月完工。参加修建工程的全体工程队员，现正赶修火车站等附属工程，以争取早日正式通车。一九四五年国民党匪军进攻解放区时，捣毁了锦承铁路，把金岭寺到承德一段的全部线路和桥梁彻底破坏。因此当地物资交流受到限制，人民的生产和生活的改善受到影响。
    人民政府为了繁荣热河省的人民经济和开发当地埋藏的资源，在今年三月间开始重建锦承路。中国共产党热河省委员会为了加强对这项工程的领导，不仅给修路工程队配备了大批政治工作干部，并且动员了四千多名铁路沿线居民组成民工队，帮助三千多名铁路职工铺轨。
    自锦承铁路重建部分逐段通车并开始进行了非正式的运输营业以来，热河省人民经济生活已开始有了改善。热河省百货公司已有二十一种工业产品重新调整了价格。例如过去在沈阳卖十四万元一箱的玻璃，运到承德就卖二十四万零九千元，现在已经降低到十四万零九千元。沈阳、承德两地一斤砂糖的差价已从百分之九点二降到百分之三点三。工业品价格的降低，也相对地提高了热河省人民的购买力。据热河省百货公司统计，八月份销售额比七月份增加了百分之七十九点四。过去该公司滞销的绒衣、女袜、儿童玩具等，现已供不应求。（新华社）
