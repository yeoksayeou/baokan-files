    Xinhua News Agency, October 28th:

    Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement again strongly protesting the British government's seizure of Chinese aircraft in Hong Kong.

    The British High Court in Hong Kong unreasonably announced a "judgment" on October 8, 1952, "awarding" 31 aircraft and other assets of the China National Aviation Corporation remaining in Hong Kong to Chennault's so-called "Civil Air Transport." This is another absurd and shameful act by the British government to seize the state property of the People's Republic of China, following the illegal "award" by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London at the end of July this year of 40 aircraft and other assets of the Central Air Transport Corporation remaining in Hong Kong to Chennault.

    Regarding the series of extremely unfriendly actions by the British government over the past three years in deliberately seizing the state assets of our China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation remaining in Hong Kong, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly lodged solemn protests with the British government and declared that the British government should bear full responsibility for this.

    However, in order to curry favor with the United States, the British government has continuously adopted despicable means of seizing the state assets of our China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation remaining in Hong Kong. The Chinese people cannot but feel deeply indignant at this tyrannical action of the British government, which repeatedly and publicly antagonizes the People's Republic of China and openly provokes the People's Republic of China.

    For this reason, the Central People's Government once again lodges a serious protest with the British government and reiterates its consistent position: the British government has absolutely no right to exercise its jurisdiction over the assets of the China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation belonging to the People's Republic of China; it also has absolutely no right to infringe, damage or transfer them. The Central People's Government demands that the British government immediately cease its illegal acts of infringing upon the sovereignty of our People's Republic of China, and immediately return all the aircraft and assets of our China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation that it has already seized and is preparing to seize to the personnel entrusted by the Central People's Government for disposal. Otherwise, the British government shall bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this open act of seizure and provocation by the British government. Beijing, October 28, 1952

### 我外交部章汉夫副部长发表声明  再度严重抗议英政府劫夺我国留港飞机

    我外交部章汉夫副部长发表声明
    再度严重抗议英政府劫夺我国留港飞机
    【新华社二十八日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部副部长章汉夫再度严重抗议英国政府劫夺我国两航留港飞机的声明。
    香港英国高等法院于一九五二年十月八日无理地宣布了一个“判决”，将中华人民共和国留在香港的中国航空公司飞机三十一架及其他资财“判给”美国陈纳德的所谓“民用航空运输公司”。这是继今年七月底伦敦英国枢密院司法委员会将中华人民共和国留在香港的中央航空公司飞机四十架及其他资财非法“判给”陈纳德之后，英国政府的又一荒谬绝伦的劫夺中华人民共和国国家财产的可耻行动。
    对于英国政府三年来蓄意劫夺上述我中国、中央两个航空公司留港国家资财的一系列极不友好的行为，中华人民共和国中央人民政府前此业已一再向英国政府提出严正抗议，并声明英国政府应为此承担全部责任。
    但是，英国政府为了献媚美国，竟仍对我中国、中央两个航空公司留港的国家资财连续采取了劫夺的卑劣手段。对于英国政府这种一再公然敌视中华人民共和国的、并向中华人民共和国公开挑衅的横暴行动，中国人民不能不深感愤怒。
    为此，中央人民政府特向英国政府再度提出严重抗议，并重申其一贯的立场，即：英国政府对于属于中华人民共和国所有的中国、中央两个航空公司留港的资财，绝对没有任何权利行使其管辖权；也绝对没有丝毫权利加以侵犯、损坏和转移。中央人民政府要求英国政府立即停止其侵犯我中华人民共和国主权的非法行为，并立即将它所已经劫夺和准备劫夺的我中国、中央两个航空公司的飞机及资财全部交还给中央人民政府所委托的人员处置。否则，由于英国政府这种公开劫夺的挑衅行动所引起的一切后果，应由英国政府完全承担。　一九五二年十月二十八日于北京
