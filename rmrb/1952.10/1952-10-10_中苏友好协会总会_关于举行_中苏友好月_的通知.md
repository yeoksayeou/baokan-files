All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
Notice on Holding "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month"

November 7th this year marks the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union. To celebrate this festival, and to widely promote socialism and communism among the masses of our people with the concrete facts of Soviet construction achievements, and to further promote the spirit of friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union, the Association has decided to hold a "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" throughout the country from November 7th to December 6th, and has invited a delegation and performing arts troupe from the Soviet Union's Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries to participate. To this end, the following is hereby notified:

I. During the aforementioned dates (November 7th to December 6th), all cities above the secondary level throughout the country must, in accordance with their local conditions, hold large-scale mass "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities for a week; wherever Soviet delegations and performing arts troupes arrive, preparations should be made starting from the beginning of November, and these activities should officially begin on the day the Soviet delegation arrives; districts, towns, and villages below the county level should also, based on local conditions, adopt various methods to carry out these activities in a concentrated or decentralized manner.

II. The activities of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" must attract and mobilize the participation of the broad masses, and its scope should include workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals, and industrialists and businessmen. The forms and methods of activities should be vivid, lively, and diverse. These forms and methods include: organizing lectures, reports, seminars, and broadcasts; showing movies and slides; holding evening parties and exhibitions; setting up propaganda stations, propaganda sheds, and rooftop broadcasts; publishing wall newspapers and blackboards; distributing propaganda pamphlets and picture albums; publishing articles and propaganda materials in newspapers and periodicals, etc. Wherever Soviet delegations and performing arts troupes arrive, they should be organized to meet with the broad masses, invited to speak and perform, and famous figures from all walks of life in our country, such as writers, scientists, professors, scholars, and labor models, should be organized to meet and talk with them.

III. The activities of this "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" should lay a good foundation for the daily work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in the future. Therefore, local friendship associations should strive to develop and consolidate their organizations during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." In places where grassroots organizations already exist, efforts should be focused on consolidating the organizations; in places where grassroots organizations have not yet been established, grassroots organizations should be established.

It is hoped that all general branch associations, provincial and municipal branch associations will make preparations early, convene relevant departments and people's organizations in the local area to establish a preparatory committee or office, formulate specific plans, and conduct regular inspections. Summaries should be made in a timely manner at the end of the campaign. Please report the current status of preparations in various places to the General Association at any time.

    一、在上述日期（十一月七日至十二月六日）内，全国中等以上城市均须依照本地具体情况，大规模地举行为期一周的群众性的“中苏友好月”的活动；凡苏联代表团和文工团到达的地方，从十一月初起进行准备，在苏联代表团抵达之日，正式开始这种活动；县以下的区、镇、乡村，也应根据当地具体条件，采用各种方式，集中地或分散地进行这种活动。
    二、“中苏友好月”的活动，必须吸引和动员广大群众参加，其范围应包括工人、农民、兵士、知识分子、工商业者。活动的形式和方法应力求生动活泼，多种多样。这些形式和方法包括：组织讲演会、报告会、座谈会和广播；演放电影、幻灯；举办晚会、展览会；设立宣传站、宣传棚和屋顶广播；出壁报、黑板报；发宣传小册子、画册；在报刊上登载文章及宣传资料等。凡苏联代表团和文工团到达的地方，应组织他们和广大群众见面，邀请他们讲话和表演，并应组织我国各界著名人物如作家、科学家、教授、学者以及劳动模范与他们见面并座谈。
    三、这次“中苏友好月”的活动中应为今后中苏友协的日常工作打下良好基础。因此，各地友协在“中苏友好月”中应力谋发展和巩固自己的组织。在已有基层组织的地方要着重巩固组织；在尚未建立基层组织的地方，要把基层组织建立起来。
