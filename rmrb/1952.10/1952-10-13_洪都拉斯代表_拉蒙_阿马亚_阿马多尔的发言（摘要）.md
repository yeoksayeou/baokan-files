    Honduran Representative
    Ramón Amaya Amador's Speech (Summary)
    For the first time, the good people of Honduras have their own representative participating in such an important conference. We cannot stand outside this great crusade for peace, which is the most just, the most noble, and of extreme importance to the people of the whole world. The current economic, social, and political situation of the Honduran people, their miserable condition as a dependent and conquered people, compels us to embark on the path of hope. We, the people of Honduras, know that the only way for the Honduran people and all other enslaved people to achieve national liberation is to win and maintain world peace and the non-discriminatory friendship between all nations, just like the fraternal friendship expressed at this great conference.
    Our country is, in effect, an American colonial outpost. Since the beginning of this century, the invasion and conquest of imperialism has made our people victims of exploitation and plunder. For more than thirty years, blood has soaked our mountains and valleys, and death has visited the homes of workers and peasants. Peasants, workers, students, the petty bourgeoisie, and others who live on wages—that is, 90 percent of the country's population—suffer economically, politically, and socially from the suffering caused by imperialist rule. Today, there is an American military delegation in our country, and those people are managing the government. They are building an army, and they also want a strong air force.
    However, the warmongers are still encountering some difficulties in carrying out their plans. The people condemn them because the people understand where all their disasters come from, and they are gradually organizing themselves to fight for their liberation. The Honduran government also wants to send cannon fodder to Korea, but they know that the Honduran people will never agree to serve those who exploit them, let alone agree to serve such an unjust and evil undertaking supported by today's neo-fascists. Now, Honduras is no longer unaware of the crimes of bacteriological warfare being carried out in Korea and China. They also know that there are powerful standard-bearers in the world promoting international peace and friendship, including the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries engaged in building a peaceful world.
    That is why, as soon as this conference issued a call, our country, as a country in the Pacific region, did not hesitate to participate. The clock marking the road of modern history is striking in Beijing today, striking the moment of noble, progressive, and friendly intentions. Honduras happily and hopefully anticipates the day when it can align its clock with the clock of Beijing, opening up the era of sincere friendship that the people of the new China are calling for to all countries.
    We, the people of Honduras, demand to live a life of warmth and sustenance in peace and to seek our liberation. We preside over the prevention of anyone in our country from going abroad to serve as cannon fodder and to kill those who have not harmed us or done us wrong. Our people should not be used to fasten the chains that oppress other nations. If there is anything we need to strive for, it is to break the chains that bind us in the process of our struggle to establish and maintain peace. The Honduran people will never shed a drop of blood for the cause of evil and death. All the strength of our people must be used to improve lives, to liberate the labor of our people, and to bring happiness and prosperity to them and to all mankind.
    We firmly oppose all acts leading to aggression and wars of plunder. Therefore, we strongly oppose and protest the heinous crimes committed in Korea; as for the heroic Korean people, we pay tribute to them here with respect and love. We also firmly oppose the crimes in Vietnam and Malaya, where the people's liberation movements are being brutally attacked. We protest the re-militarization of Japan and West Germany, we firmly oppose the aggressive agreements that are made in the name of democracy and are hostile to humanity, and we oppose all these harmful and evil acts with all our might.
    I declare that this is our position, and we will work with the people of the world who love peace and defend peace to do our utmost to fulfill our mission, to continue to fight for peace, and to peacefully join the ranks of the world's nations moving forward.
    On behalf of the peace advocates in my homeland, which is far from here, I pay tribute to the people of all countries gathered here, you are gathered here not to attack anyone, but only to defend the people of all countries, to live, to create. I would rather simply and clearly tell some of the Honduran peace advocates that I have to convey to the great people of the People's Republic of China, that is, when the so-called National Assembly of Honduras even declared China, which we love and admire so much, as an aggressor nation, all the upright people of Honduras felt supreme anger. This protest illustrates our abhorrence of such an action and clearly illustrates our friendly feelings towards the Chinese people and their people's government, who are the true standard-bearers of world peace. I am now representing Honduras at this conference, and this is our people's response to the shameful attitude taken by that anti-democratic Congress.
    Friends, representatives from countries in Asia and the Pacific, all I can say is to repeat my tribute to you all, and to ask you to convey our respects to the people in your respective countries. With a humble and sincere heart (the people of Honduras are humble and sincere), on this historic day, I say to you with fraternal affection and optimism: Unite and advance for the victory of the people of the world in the cause of peace! Let us destroy war in the flame of everlasting friendship! Long live peace! (Xinhua News Agency)

### 洪都拉斯代表  拉蒙·阿马亚·阿马多尔的发言（摘要）

    洪都拉斯代表
    拉蒙·阿马亚·阿马多尔的发言（摘要）
    洪都拉斯的善良人民，第一次有自己的代表参加像这样一个重大的会议。我们是不可能站在这个伟大的和平十字军的外面的，它是最正义的、最崇高的和对全世界人民极端重要的事。洪都拉斯人民今天的经济、社会和政治情况，他们作为附属国的和被征服的人民的可悲的状况，使我们不得不走上追求希望的道路。我们洪都拉斯人民知道：洪都拉斯人民和一切其他被奴役的人民要获得民族解放，唯一的方法就是要赢得并维护世界和平和各国人民相互间毫无歧视的友好，就如在我们这个伟大的会议上所发表的兄弟友好一样。
    我们的国家实际上是美国的一个殖民地前哨。自从本世纪开始以来，帝国主义的侵入和征服，使我国的人民成为剥削和掠夺的牺牲者。三十多年来，鲜血浸濡了我们的山峰和溪谷，死亡光顾着工人和农民的家庭。农民、工人、学生、小资产阶级以及其他靠工资过活的人——即占全国人口百分之九十的人民，在经济上、政治上和社会上都遭受着帝国主义统治所引起的痛苦。今天，有一个美国军事代表团在我们国家里，就是那些人在管理政府。他们正在建立一支军队，他们还要一支强大的空军。
    但是，战争贩子在推行他们计划的过程中，仍然遇到一些困难。人民谴责他们，因为人民很明白他们所有的灾难来自何处，并且他们正逐渐把自己组织起来，为他们的解放而斗争。洪都拉斯政府也想派送炮灰到朝鲜去，但是他们知道洪都拉斯人民绝不会同意去为那些剥削他们的家伙服务，更不会同意去为今天新法西斯分子所支持的这样一个非正义和罪恶的勾当服务。现在，洪都拉斯对于在朝鲜和中国进行的细菌战罪行，已经不是没有认识了。他们也知道了，世界上有着促进国际和平与友好的强大旗手，其中包括着伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和其他正在从事建设和平世界的国家。
    这就是为什么这次会议一发出号召，作为太平洋区域一个国家的我国，就毫不犹豫地参加了会议。标志着现代历史道路的时钟，今天正在北京敲着，敲出了高尚、进步与友好的意愿的时刻。洪都拉斯愉快而满怀希望地期待着有那一天，它能够使自己的时钟与北京的时钟一致，开辟那新中国人民向所有国家召唤的真诚友谊的时代。
    我们洪都拉斯人民要求在和平里过温饱的生活和求得我们的解放。我们主持阻止我们国家中任何一个人到国外去充当炮灰，去杀害那些无害于我们也没有对不起我们的人。我们的人民不应该被利用来扣紧压迫其他民族的锁链。如果有任何东西需要我们去争取的话，那便是在我们建立与维持和平的斗争过程中粉碎束缚我们的锁链。洪都拉斯人民决不为罪恶和死亡的事业流一滴血。我国人民的全部力量必须用来改善生活，用来解放我国人民的劳动，并给他们以及全人类带来幸福和繁荣。
    我们坚决反对一切导向侵略和掠夺战争的行为。因此我们强烈地反对并抗议在朝鲜所犯的可恨的罪行；至于英勇的朝鲜人民我们这里以尊敬和热爱的心情向他们致敬。我们也坚决反对在越南和马来亚的罪行，那儿的人民解放运动正受到野蛮的攻击。我们抗议使日本和西德重新军国主义化，我们坚决反对假借民主的名义而订立的与人类为敌的侵略协定，我们用全力反对所有这些有害的邪恶的行为。
    我宣布这就是我们的立场，并且我们将要和全世界爱好和平，保卫和平的人民一起尽我们的最大力量来完成我们的任务，继续不断地为和平而奋斗，并和平地参加世界各民族前进的队伍。
    我代表我那离此遥远的本国的和平拥护者，向聚集在这里的各国人民致敬，你们聚集在这里不是想攻击任何人，而只是要保卫各国人民，要生活，要创造。我更愿意向中华人民共和国的伟大人民简单明了地讲述一些洪都拉斯和平拥护者们所要我传达的东西，那就是，当洪都拉斯的所谓国民议会竟至宣布我们所那样热爱和羡慕的中国为侵略国家时，所有洪都拉斯正直的人民都感到无上的愤怒。这个抗议说明我们对这样一个行动的憎恶，并明确地说明了我们对于作为真正世界和平旗手的中国人民和他们的人民政府所抱的友好感情。我现在代表洪都拉斯参加了这个会议，这就是我国人民对那反民主的国会所采取的可耻态度的回答。
    朋友们，来自亚洲及太平洋各国的代表们，我还能说的就是重复我对大家的致敬，和请求你们把我们的敬意转达给你们各个国家里的人民。我以谦卑与诚恳的心情（洪都拉斯的人民都是谦卑和诚恳的），在这具有历史意义的日子里，用兄弟般的感情与乐观的情绪对你们说：为了世界人民在和平事业中的胜利团结起来前进吧！让我们在永远不衰的友谊的火焰中把战争销毁！和平万岁！（新华社）
