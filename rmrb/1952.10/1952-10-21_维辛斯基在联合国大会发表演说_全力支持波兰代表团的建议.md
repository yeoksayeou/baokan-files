Xinhua News Agency, New York, 20th: The UN General Assembly continued its general debate at its plenary meeting on the morning of October 18th.

Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, delivered a lengthy speech at the meeting, which attracted great attention from all parties. Vyshinsky said that peace is the main issue facing the world today. He reviewed the Soviet Union's efforts to strive for peace at previous UN General Assemblies and fully supported the proposal put forward by the Polish delegation at the meeting on October 17th.

After Vyshinsky finished his speech, he received warm applause.

Other speakers at the meeting included representatives from Ecuador, Paraguay, and Panama.

Ecuadorian representative Trujillo expressed sympathy for the independence movements in Tunisia and Morocco, but at the same time expressed his belief that France would sympathetically consider the wishes of these two countries.

Paraguayan representative Ocampos supported the United States' attitude on the Panmunjom negotiations and other issues, but at the same time expressed concern about the situation of "backward countries" and advocated that the United Nations should provide these countries with more technical assistance.

Panamanian representative Guizado only spoke briefly. He expressed regret that some countries that had applied to join the United Nations had not been able to do so, and expressed the hope that all countries that abide by the principles of the UN Charter and are willing to uphold the Charter could become members of the United Nations. The meeting then adjourned.
