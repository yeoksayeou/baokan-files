    Qinhuangdao City Construction Company's Blind Design and Careless Construction Lead to Bad Results
    Editor: The Qinhuangdao City Construction Company undertook the construction of five hundred dormitory rooms for the China Coal Miners' School. In this project, their blind design and careless construction caused significant damage to state property.
    The engineering design work began in May. After the design was completed, we discovered that the beams and purlins used in the design were all Manchurian ash and elm wood. We immediately asked Technician Pan, who was responsible for the design, whether the load-bearing capacity of this material had been calculated. Technician Pan replied, "It has been calculated, and the load-bearing capacity is sufficient." However, soon after, two large beams in the newly built student dormitory were broken in succession. Fearing even greater problems, we asked the Coal Mine Management Bureau to send engineering technicians to the site for inspection. The results revealed that the beams and purlins they used were not up to standard. According to national regulations, the safety factor should be six times, but the material they used only had a safety factor of three. More than eighty dormitory rooms already have their top grids nailed in place. These top grids must be dismantled and reinforced.
    In addition, the budget stipulated that pure lime should be used for the white ash used to build the walls. However, this company allowed workers to use lime containing one-tenth impurities and to mix it with seventy percent lumps and thirty percent powder, resulting in a 20 percent reduction in project quality.
    We hope that the Qinhuangdao City Construction Company will promptly send personnel to conduct a thorough on-site inspection and correct the above errors. We also hope that the relevant personnel responsible for the above incidents will be given due punishment to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

### 山海关市建筑公司盲目设计草率施工造成恶果

    山海关市建筑公司盲目设计草率施工造成恶果
    编辑同志：山海关市建筑公司承做了中国煤矿工人学校五百间宿舍工程。在这一工程中，他们盲目设计，草率施工，给国家财产造成很大的损失。
    工程设计工作在五月份即开始。设计完毕后，我们发现设计中所用梁檩都是水曲柳和山榆木的。当即问负责设计的潘技师，用这种料是否计算过它的载重量。潘技师回答说：“已算过了，载重量足够。”但不久新建学员宿舍连续压断两根大梁。我们怕出更大的问题，便请煤矿管理总局派工程技术人员到现场检查。结果发觉他们所用的梁檩都不够标准，按国家规定的安全系数应为六倍，而他们用的料只有三倍。现在已有八十多间宿舍钉好顶栅。这些顶栅必须拆毁，重新加固。
    另外，砌墙用的白灰，预算中规定为纯灰。但这个公司却让工人用内含十分之一杂质的灰，并让用七成块三成末掺在一起使用，以致工程质量降低了百分之二十。
    我们希望山海关市建筑公司迅速派员深入现场彻底检查，纠正上述错误。并希望对造成上述事件的有关人员，予以应得的处分，以免今后再有类似事件发生。
