Japanese Representative
Ozawa Kiyoshi's Speech on the Korean Issue (Summary)
We, the Japanese people, like the people of the world, unanimously hope for an immediate end to the Korean War on a fair and reasonable basis. Because the Korean War is a major issue concerning the destiny of the Japanese people, whether they move towards war or peace. First, the Korean War is being waged right before the eyes of the Japanese people, and it is being waged with Japan as its base. Second, since the outbreak of the Korean War, the Yoshida government has forced Japan's important industries to manufacture war supplies for the United States, resulting in the gradual decline of peaceful industries and the weakening of trade. Third, the United States and the Japanese government, disregarding world public opinion, hastily concluded a one-sided peace treaty in San Francisco, openly rearming Japan, and attempting to send the Japanese people to the Korean battlefield as cannon fodder.
    Therefore, the Japanese people deeply feel that the Korean War will involve them in a whirlpool of war, and there is a danger of developing into a full-scale Asian war centered on Japan. For this reason, the Japanese people's determination to defend peace has been greatly encouraged. Since the beginning of the Korean War, Japanese workers, under the slogans of "No participation in the Korean War," "No manufacturing of war supplies," and "No transporting of war supplies," have been fighting against American soldiers and Japanese armed police and foremen in every factory and at every work post, launching mass strikes and various resistance movements.
    The Japanese people are very angry about the United States' delay and obstruction of the Korean armistice negotiations. The only unresolved issue in the armistice negotiations, the exchange of prisoners of war, is due to the U.S. side making excuses, saying: "Korean and Chinese prisoners of war are unwilling to return to their country." But the Japanese people know very well that this is just a deceptive trick by the United States to delay the war. The Japanese people understand that the U.S. military wants to use the lull in the armistice negotiations to accelerate the rearmament of Japan and prepare to supplement the U.S.'s unfavorable war situation with the blood of the Japanese people. At the same time as the U.S. military bombed the Supung hydroelectric power plant, it conducted air defense exercises throughout Japan, which is the beginning of driving the Japanese people to the Korean battlefield.
    We, the Japanese people, demand the immediate conclusion of a fair and reasonable armistice agreement and the unconditional return of all prisoners of war from both sides to their home countries. We firmly believe that those who refuse to unconditionally return prisoners of war to their home countries, use prisoners of war as experimental subjects for bacteriological warfare, delay and expand the war of aggression, and slaughter innocent women, children, and the elderly are the most hateful enemies of mankind.
    The U.S. military, which is invading Korea, has also illegally and permanently occupied Japan. They are not only criminals who invaded Korea, but also foreign invaders of Japan. Their casual entry and exit to Korea and Japan seriously undermines world peace and violates the reasonable principle that "the problems of a country should be solved by the people of that country themselves." We, the Japanese people, appeal to the people of the world: "The affairs of Korea should be solved by the Korean people themselves," and "The affairs of Japan should be solved by the Japanese people themselves." We oppose the U.S. occupation forces remaining in Japanese territory and depriving Japan of its independent sovereignty. Similarly, we also oppose the U.S. aggressors interfering in Korea and undermining the independence and unification of Korea.
    Now the Korean people and the Japanese people have reached a time when they must unite strongly to defend peace in Asia. The struggle goals of the Korean people and the Japanese people are consistent. Both nations are fighting against warmongers at home and abroad. The Korean people demand an immediate armistice, and the Japanese people demand a comprehensive peace treaty, and jointly fight to defend the principles of peace and democracy.
    The Japanese people pay high respect to the bravest peace fighters in the world – the Korean people, and express our brotherly friendship to you. Of course, the Japanese people are fully aware that you have unforgettable hatred for Japanese imperialism, and we are also fully aware that we must take responsibility for this. However, under the occupation of the U.S. military, the Japanese people are suffering unprecedented humiliation and pain, and therefore have risen up to wage a heroic struggle against U.S. warmongers and Japanese militarists.
    Great peace fighters of Korea! You have led the forces of the entire nation to struggle until now, which is the most valuable lesson and encouragement to us, the Japanese people. We now vow to follow you and become the standard-bearers of peace in Asia and the world. You are in Korea, which the U.S. aggressors want to turn into a fuse for Asia, and we are in its rear – Japan, the largest base for the Asian war of aggression. Let us fight resolutely for peace together! We vow to stand with you in the most difficult and glorious posts and fight to the end.
    Fight to establish peace and democracy in the entire Asia and Pacific region! Fight to make Asia a peaceful and free Asia! To achieve this goal, we hope that you will give ardent support to the Korean people and the Japanese people who demand the immediate cessation of the Korean War and a comprehensive peace treaty.

### 日本代表  小泽清关于朝鲜问题的发言（摘要）

    日本代表
    小泽清关于朝鲜问题的发言（摘要）
    我们日本人民与全世界人民一样，一致切望在公平合理的基础上立即停止朝鲜战争。因为朝鲜战争是有关决定日本人民走向战争或和平命运的重大问题。第一、朝鲜战争就在日本人民的眼前进行着，而且是以日本为基地进行的。第二、朝鲜战争发生以来，吉田政府一方面强制日本的重要工业为美国制造军需品，以致和平工业日趋萎缩，贸易逐渐衰弱。第三、美国与日本政府更不顾世界舆论的反对，慌张地在旧金山缔结了片面的媾和条约，公然进行重新武装日本，企图把日本人民送到朝鲜战场当炮灰。
    因此，日本人民深切地感到朝鲜战争将使自己卷入战争的漩涡，并有发展成为以日本为中心的亚洲全面战争的危险。为此，日本人民保卫和平的斗争决心大为振奋。日本的工人们，从朝鲜战争开始以来，在“不参与朝鲜战争”、“不制造军需品”、“不运送军需品”的口号下，在每一工厂里、在各个的工作岗位上，向美国兵和日本武装警察以及把头们进行着斗争，展开着群众性的怠工和各种各样的反抗运动。
    日本人民对于美国拖延和阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的进行，他们感到非常愤怒。现在停战谈判唯一未解决的交换战俘问题的内容，就是因为美方制造藉口，说：“朝鲜与中国战俘不愿意回国。”可是日本人民都很清楚地知道：这不过是美国为了要拖延战争的欺人之谈而已。日本国民理解到：美军要利用停战谈判的空隙，加紧重新武装日本，准备以日本人的血液来补充美国已陷在不利状态中的战局。美军在轰炸水丰发电厂的同时，在日本全国实行防空演习，这就是要把日本人驱上朝鲜战场的开始。
    我们日本人民要求立即缔结公平合理的停战协定，将双方的战俘无条件地送还本国。我们肯定地认为：拒绝将战俘无条件地送还本国，把战俘作为细菌战的实验品，拖延并扩大侵略战争，屠杀无辜的妇女、孩童和老人的犯罪者，是人类最可憎恶的敌人。
    侵略朝鲜的美军，也同样地非法永久地占领了日本。他们不单是侵略朝鲜的犯罪者，而且是日本的外来侵略者。他们随便出入朝鲜和日本，严重地破坏了世界和平和违反了“本国的问题由本国人民自己解决”的合理原则。我们日本人民向全世界人民呼吁：“朝鲜的事情由朝鲜人民自己解决”、“日本的事情由日本人民自己解决”。我们反对美国占领军驻留在日本的国土之内，剥夺日本的独立主权，同样我们也反对美国侵略者干涉朝鲜，破坏朝鲜的独立和统一。
    现在朝鲜人民和日本人民已经到了为保卫亚洲和平而必须坚强团结起来的时候了。朝鲜人民和日本人民的斗争目的是一致的。两民族是同样地与国内外的战争挑拨者进行着斗争。朝鲜人民要求立即停战，日本人民要求全面媾和，共同为卫护和平民主的原则而斗争。
    日本人民对世界上最勇敢的和平战士——朝鲜人民，致以崇高的敬意、并对你们表示兄弟般的友谊。当然，日本人民充分知道你们对日本帝国主义有着忘不掉的仇恨，同时也充分知道我们必须对这一点负责。但是，日本人民在美军的占领下，遭受着未曾有过的耻辱和痛苦，因此已经起来向美国战争挑拨者和日本军国主义者进行英勇的斗争。
    朝鲜伟大的和平战士们！你们已经领导全民族的力量斗争到现在，这对我们日本人民是最宝贵的教训和鼓励。我们现在誓继你们之后，成为亚洲及世界和平的旗手。你们在美国侵略者要把它变为亚洲导火线的朝鲜，我们在它的后方——亚洲侵略战争最大基地的日本，让我们共同为和平而坚决斗争吧！我们誓必和你们一道站在最困难最光荣的岗位上而斗争到底。
    为了在全亚洲及太平洋区域树立和平与民主而斗争！为了使亚洲变为和平自由的亚洲而斗争！为了达到这个目的，我们渴望诸位给予要求实现立即停止朝鲜战争和全面和约的朝鲜人民和日本人民以热烈的支持。（新华社）
