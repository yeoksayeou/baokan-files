    Bravely Shoulder the Glorious Task of People's Supervision Correspondents
    Editor: We are people's supervision correspondents. We fully support the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Strengthening People's Supervision Correspondents and People's Complaint Reception Offices" published in the People's Daily. This instruction fully demonstrates the excellent democratic system of the New Democratic state. This is an effective measure to connect with the masses, improve work, and safeguard national policies and laws. Only in this way can we consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and only then can the country's large-scale economic construction proceed smoothly. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to this duty that we should have fulfilled. We always felt that there were no problems to report, and we reflected very few issues. However, the facts revealed by the "Three-Anti" movement prove that it was not that there were no problems, but that we did not seriously discover them. The Government Administration Council's instructions are a great inspiration and encouragement to us. We are determined to overcome difficulties in the future, strengthen ties with the masses, carefully and conscientiously observe problems, analyze problems, contact the People's Supervision Committee in a timely manner, and bravely shoulder the glorious task of people's supervision correspondents.

    勇敢地担负起人民监察通讯员的光荣任务
    编辑同志：我们是人民监察通讯员。人民日报登载的政务院“关于加强人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室的指示”，我们完全拥护。这个指示充分地表现了新民主主义国家优良的民主制度。这是联系群众、改进工作、卫护国家政策法令的有效措施。只有这样作，才能巩固“三反”“五反”的成果，才能使祖国大规模的经济建设顺利进行。从前我们对这一应尽的义务是不够重视的，老是觉得没有什么问题可以报告，反映的问题很少。但“三反”运动检查出来的事实证明，不是无问题，而是我们没有认真去发现问题。政务院的指示对我们来说，是一个很大的启发和鼓励。我们下定决心，今后一定要克服困难，加强与群众的联系，并细心地认真地去观察问题、分析问题，及时地和人民监察委员会取得联系，勇敢地担负起人民监察通讯员的光荣任务。
