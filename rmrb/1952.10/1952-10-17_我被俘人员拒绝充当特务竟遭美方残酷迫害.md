Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th - It is now verified that two Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, who were previously falsely claimed to have "escaped" by the U.S. negotiation chief representative Harrison, were imprisoned in a U.S. military intelligence agency in Seoul because they refused to act as U.S. military spies. For months, Harrison has consistently been afraid to deny the U.S. side's criminal behavior of violating the Geneva Convention and forcing prisoners of war to act as spies. This, from another perspective, exposes that the U.S. side's so-called "humanitarian" and "non-forcible repatriation" principles are entirely a clumsy trick used to obstruct and interrupt negotiations.

On July 17th of this year, Harrison, in a letter claiming to be "for the sake of expressing sincerity from all parties," notified our side that Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war Xu Jin and Tang Hao had "escaped" separately on March 21st and April 23rd of this year. However, according to Huang Shi (U.S. detention number 710488), a Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war who was forced by the U.S. side to act as a spy and airdropped into our area, they personally witnessed Xu and Tang being imprisoned in the basement of the U.S. intelligence agency in Seoul on March 29th of this year. Huang Shi, et al., were sent to the U.S. intelligence agency in Seoul after being forced by the U.S. side to receive special agent training in Tokyo. The head of this intelligence agency, Wang Yung-ko, a South Korean U.S. special agent, and an instructor surnamed Jin often used the examples of Xu Jin and Tang Hao to threaten them. These two special agents said: Xu Jin and Tang Hao have been imprisoned because they are unwilling to do "intelligence work" for the "United Nations forces." Huang Shi also reported that on the third day after they arrived at this intelligence agency, Xu Jin secretly dropped a small note written in pencil beside him while going to the toilet. The note said: He and Tang Hao have been imprisoned for more than half a month because they were unwilling to act as U.S. military spies. The U.S. agents continue to persecute them, but their determination will never change. According to Huang Shi, et al., they personally witnessed that the entrance to the basement where Xu and Tang were imprisoned was closely guarded day and night by South Korean U.S. agents. The prisoners were not allowed to speak or move around. When Huang Shi, et al., were escorted to another place in April, Xu and Tang were still imprisoned there.

In addition to Xu Jin and Tang Hao, according to another U.S. airdropped agent report, three other Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, Long Fei, Xie Sen, and Chen Daren, were escorted from Seoul to the U.S. intelligence agency on Lidao Island outside Wonsan Harbor on April 22nd after being forced to undergo special agent training. Because they consistently refused to act as special agents, the head of the intelligence agency—an American captain—finally imprisoned them.

Among the Volunteer Army prisoners of war whom Harrison claimed in his July 17th letter to have "escaped," at least five have been forced to act as special agents, airdropped into our area, and reported the entire process to our side. Two are known to have been imprisoned by the U.S. side for refusing to act as special agents. General Nan Ri had long requested the U.S. side to make an honest explanation of these prisoners of war, but Harrison has consistently dared not explain or deny it for three months. This is another ironclad proof that the U.S. side's so-called "non-forcible repatriation" is to detain a large number of prisoners of war and force them to re-enter the war as cannon fodder. The U.S. side insists on such an obviously absurd claim precisely because they know that this claim can absolutely not solve the problem, so that they can prolong and even expand the Korean War.

### 我被俘人员拒绝充当特务竟遭美方残酷迫害

    我被俘人员拒绝充当特务竟遭美方残酷迫害
    【新华社开城十六日电】现在查明：有两名从前被美方谈判首席代表哈利逊谎称已经“逃亡”的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，因为不愿充当美军特务，曾被美方囚禁在汉城的一个特务机关里。几个月来，哈利逊始终不敢否认美方破坏日内瓦公约、强迫战俘充当特务的罪恶行为。这从另一个角度上揭穿了美方的所谓“人道主义的”“不得强迫遣返”的原则，完全是一个用来阻挠及中断谈判的拙劣骗局。
    今年七月十七日，哈利逊在他的一封声称“为了各方表示诚实”的信中，通知我方说：中国人民志愿军被俘人员徐进和唐浩，已分别在今年三月二十一日及四月二十三日“逃亡”。但是，据被美方强迫充当特务而空降到我方地区的中国人民志愿军被俘人员黄时（美方拘留号码七一零四八八）等向我方报告：他们在今年三月二十九日，还亲眼看见徐、唐两人被囚禁在汉城的美方特务机关的地下室里。黄时等当时是在被美方强迫到东京接受特务训练后，被送到汉城的美方特务机关。这个特务机关的负责人南朝鲜籍美方特务王允阁，和一个姓金的教官经常用徐进和唐浩两个人的例子来威胁他们。这两个特务说：徐进和唐浩因为不愿为“联合国军”做“情报工作”，所以已被囚禁起来。黄时还报告说：在他们到达这个特务机关后的第三天，徐进在上厕所时，曾偷偷地把一张铅笔写的小纸条掉在他身边。条子上说：他和唐浩两人因为不愿充当美军特务，已被囚禁半个多月了。美方特务不断迫害他们，但是他们的决心决不改变。据黄时等当时亲眼看到：囚禁徐、唐两人的地下室门口日夜有南朝鲜籍美方特务严密看守。被监禁者不得说话和走动。黄时等在四月间被押到另外一个地方去时，徐、唐两人仍被囚禁在那里。
    除了徐进和唐浩两人而外，据另一个美方空降特务报告说：另有中国人民志愿军战俘龙飞、谢森、陈达仁三人，在被迫受特务训练后，于今年四月二十二日被从汉城押到元山港外丽岛上的美方特务机关。由于他们始终拒绝充当特务，该特务机关的负责人——一个美国上尉最后把他们囚禁了起来。
    被哈利逊在七月十七日的信中声称“已经逃亡”的志愿军被俘人员，其中至少有五个已被迫充当特务空降到我区向我方报告了全部经过情形，有两个已知因拒绝充当特务而被美方囚禁起来。南日将军早就要求美方对这些战俘重新作诚实交待，但是哈利逊三个月来始终不敢交待，也始终不敢否认。这又是一个铁证，表明美方的所谓“不得强迫遣返”，就是扣留大批战俘，强迫他们重新参加战争充当炮灰。美方坚持这样一个显然荒谬的主张，正是因为他们深知这个主张绝对不能解决问题，这样就可以延长以至扩大朝鲜战争。
