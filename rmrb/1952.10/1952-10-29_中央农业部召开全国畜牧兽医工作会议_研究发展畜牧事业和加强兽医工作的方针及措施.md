    The Central Ministry of Agriculture convened a National Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Work Conference in September. The conference summarized the animal husbandry and veterinary work of the past three years and focused on studying the guidelines and tasks for animal husbandry and veterinary work in the future.
    In the past three years, thanks to the concern and leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Government for animal husbandry, as well as the hard work of the broad masses of farmers, herdsmen, and animal husbandry and veterinary workers, the number of livestock nationwide has increased significantly. Large livestock increased by 26 percent, exceeding the pre-war level by about 6 percent; sheep increased by 42 percent, approaching the pre-war level. Livestock diseases have also decreased year by year. In the past three years, more than 87 million heads of poultry and livestock have been treated for diseases. Rinderpest has been basically eradicated, and foot-and-mouth disease and anthrax can now be controlled and no longer spread widely. The conference analyzed the current situation of animal husbandry production and believed that the progress of animal husbandry in the past three years has been significant. However, from the perspective of the development of agricultural productivity, the needs of industry and export, and the improvement of people's lives, the supply of livestock and animal products is still insufficient. In order to meet the production requirements of farmers to increase unit area yield and appropriately expand cultivated land area, it is estimated that another 10 million heads of livestock need to be supplemented nationwide to be fully utilized. To improve the lives of ethnic minorities, it is also necessary to start with the development of animal husbandry. With the development of production, the proportion of animal husbandry in the national economy is increasing day by day. The conference criticized the erroneous thinking of some cadres who did not pay attention to animal husbandry and the purely technical viewpoints of some animal husbandry and veterinary workers. The conference pointed out that these erroneous thoughts and viewpoints are obstacles to the further development of animal husbandry and must be thoroughly corrected.
    Regarding the guidelines and tasks for animal husbandry and veterinary work in the future, the conference, after detailed discussion, unanimously agreed that: (1) In order to supply agricultural power and fertilizer, as well as raw materials for industry, export materials, and animal products needed for people's lives, it is necessary to mobilize farmers and herdsmen, organize them, carry out a patriotic livestock increase movement, and breed various livestock in large quantities, while paying attention to improving product quality. (2) At present, the nationwide focus is still on breeding draft animals, focusing on the development of cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules (mules born from donkeys) based on regional conditions and production needs. In the vast pastoral areas and mountainous areas with abundant grass, sheep should be bred; in farming areas, pigs should be developed; and dairy cows should be developed near cities. (3) Pastoral areas should vigorously organize animal husbandry mutual aid teams, and where conditions permit, pilot animal husbandry production cooperatives should be established, and herdsmen should be led to gradually move towards settled rotational grazing; mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives in farming areas should include livestock breeding in their production plans to appropriately combine agriculture and animal husbandry. (4) Veterinary prevention and control work should focus on improving feeding management, supplemented by injection treatment. In epidemic areas, the first step is to organize the masses to carry out blockade, isolation, disinfection, and destruction of corpses; in normal times, efforts should be made to fundamentally solve the problem of livestock health care.
    In order to implement this policy, the conference believes that the following measures must be taken: (1) Protect and improve grasslands to ensure that livestock have sufficient grass. Grassland work stations should be established in pastoral and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas to organize herdsmen to implement rational grazing and settled rotational grazing to solve the problems of forage and infectious diseases, and attention should be paid to developing water sources. Farming areas should provide farmers with fuel to avoid burning feed as firewood. (2) Protect livestock health by starting with feeding management and environmental hygiene, paying special attention to building livestock sheds, storing winter grass, and doing a good job in safely overwintering. (3) Vigorously promote seed selection and breeding, and promote improved varieties: mobilize herdsmen and farmers to select seeds and breeding, and avoid random mating; focus on establishing state-owned breeding stations to unite and guide private breeding households, carry out on-site seed selection, and focus on promoting improved breeds. (4) Strengthen feeding management, prevent the occurrence of animal epidemics, and organize herdsmen and farmers to blockade and isolate in epidemic areas, supplemented by drug treatment, requiring that epidemics be eliminated wherever they occur.
    (5) Plan and vigorously organize the transportation and sale of livestock and animal products. At present, some areas have a phenomenon of imbalance in the supply and marketing of livestock and animal products. Some places are suffering from not being able to buy livestock, while others have accumulated a large amount of livestock that cannot be sold, and prices have fallen abnormally. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the work of purchasing and transferring to ensure the labor income of livestock producers and stimulate their enthusiasm for increasing livestock. (6) Train cadres in large numbers. In addition to training technical cadres for animal husbandry and veterinary medicine at all levels and strengthening the business training of animal husbandry workers at all levels, efforts should be made to unite traditional Chinese medicine veterinarians, strengthen their political education, and improve their scientific and technical level so that they can better serve farmers and herdsmen.
    The conference believes that all the above measures must start with mobilizing the masses, organizing them, and carrying out a patriotic livestock increase movement. Only by relying on the masses, developing the production enthusiasm of the masses, and combining personal interests with national interests can we achieve the requirement of gradually increasing breeding in large quantities.

    中央农业部召开全国畜牧兽医工作会议
    研究发展畜牧事业和加强兽医工作的方针及措施
    中央人民政府农业部曾在九月间召开了全国畜牧兽医工作会议。这次会议总结了三年来的畜牧兽医工作，着重地研究了今后畜牧兽医工作的方针任务。
    三年来，由于毛主席、中国共产党和人民政府对于畜牧事业的关怀和领导，以及广大农民、牧民和畜牧兽医工作干部的辛勤努力，全国牲畜显著增加。大家畜增加百分之二十六，超过战前约百分之六；绵羊增加百分之四十二，接近战前水平。牲畜疫病也逐年减轻，三年来经过防治疾病的禽畜共八千七百多万头，牛瘟已基本扑灭，口蹄疫、炭疽也已经能控制，不再大量传播。会议分析了目前畜牧生产的情况，认为三年来畜牧业的进展是显著的，但从农业生产力的发展和工业、外销的需要以及人民生活提高等方面来看，牲畜和畜产品的供应仍感不足。为了满足农民提高单位面积产量和适当扩大耕地面积的生产要求，估计在全国范围需再补充一千万头牲畜，才能充分敷用。为了改善少数民族人民的生活，也必须从发展畜牧事业着手。随着生产事业的发展，畜牧业在国民经济中的比重日益增加，会议批判了部分干部不重视畜牧事业的错误思想，和部分畜牧兽医工作人员的单纯技术观点。会议指出这些错误思想和观点，是进一步发展畜牧事业的障碍，必须彻底纠正。
    对今后畜牧兽医工作的方针和任务，会议经过详细讨论，一致认为：（一）为了供给农业使用的畜力与肥料，以及工业用的原料、外销物资，和人民生活上所需要的畜产品，必须发动农民、牧民，组织起来，开展爱国增畜运动，大量繁殖各种牲畜，同时注意提高产品质量。（二）目前全国范围仍以繁殖役畜为主，依据地区条件和生产需要，着重发展牛、马、驴骡（驴生的骡子），在广大牧区及草多的山区，应繁殖绵羊；农作区应发展养猪；城市附近发展乳牛。（三）牧区应大力组织畜牧互助组，有条件的地区试办畜牧生产合作社，并领导牧民逐渐走向定居轮牧；农作区的互助组和农业生产合作社应将牲畜繁殖列入生产计划，使农牧业适当结合。（四）兽医防治工作应以改善饲养管理为主，注射治疗为辅。在疫区首先要从组织群众进行封锁、隔离、消毒、毁尸着手；平时要求从根本上着眼解决牲畜保健问题。
    为了贯彻这个方针，会议认为必须采取下列措施：（一）保护和改良草原，保证牲畜有足够的用草。牧区和半农半牧区要设立草原工作站，组织牧民实行合理放牧，定居轮牧，以解决草料和传染病的问题，并注意开辟水源。农区要供给农民燃料，以免把饲料当柴烧了。（二）从饲养管理、环境卫生等方面着手，保护牲畜健康，特别要注意修建畜舍，储备冬草，作好安全过冬工作。（三）大力推行选种配种工作，推广优良品种：发动牧民、农民选种配种，避免乱交乱配现象；有重点地设立公营配种站，以团结和指导民营配种户，进行就地选种工作，并有重点地推广良种。（四）加强饲养管理、预防兽疫发生，在疫区组织牧民、农民封锁隔离，辅以药剂治疗，要求疫病发生在那里，就扑灭在那里。
    （五）有计划地大力组织牲畜和畜产品的运销。目前有些地区牲畜和畜产品有供销失调现象，有的地方苦于买不到牲畜，有些地方则积存大量牲畜卖不出去，价格畸形跌落。为此，必须加强收购调运工作，保证畜牧生产者的劳动利得，以刺激他们增加牲畜的情绪。（六）大量培养干部。除培养各级畜牧兽医技术干部，加强各级畜牧工作者的业务训练外，并着重团结中医兽医，加强对他们的政治教育，提高他们的科学技术水平，使他们更好地为农民、牧民服务。
    会议认为，以上各项措施，都必须从发动群众，组织起来开展爱国增畜运动着手，只有依靠群众，发扬群众的生产积极性，把个人利益和国家利益结合起来，才能达到大量繁殖逐渐提高的要求。
