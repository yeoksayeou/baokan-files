    (Xinhua News Agency) The 1952 National Table Tennis Tournament opened in Beijing on October 12th. Sixty-two male and female athletes from seven units, including major administrative regions and the China Railway Sports Association, are participating in the tournament. Attendees at the opening ceremony included Ma Xulun, Minister of Education of the Central People's Government and Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation; Rong Gaotang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and Vice Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation; and Huang Zhong, Acting Secretary-General of the All-China Sports Federation. In addition, Mr. Montagu, Secretary of the World Peace Council and President of the International Table Tennis Federation, who is currently in Beijing attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, also attended the meeting.
    At the meeting, Ma Xulun, Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation, delivered the opening speech. He said: "The holding of a national table tennis tournament demonstrates the importance attached to sports by the Communist Party and the People's Government. This tournament will surely promote the further development and improvement of table tennis in our country. At the same time, the first group of national table tennis players will be selected to represent our country in the first Asian Table Tennis Championships to be held in Singapore in November this year." He also pointed out: "Our large-scale economic construction is about to begin, but American imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, continuing to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations, and plotting to expand the war of aggression. Let us strive to develop sports, strengthen our bodies, and contribute our greatest strength to the construction of our motherland and to peace in Asia and the world."
    Montagu then spoke. He said: China's table tennis technology is among the best in the world. Since liberation, the progress of the people of New China in everything has been very rapid, so I believe that the progress of table tennis in New China will also be very rapid. Finally, he said: The next World Table Tennis Championships will be held in Bucharest, and I believe that table tennis players from all over the world will be willing to be friends with you and compete with you. We welcome your athletes to participate.
    The opening ceremony concluded. Amidst warm applause, the competition began.

    全国乒乓球比赛大会开幕
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：一九五二年全国乒乓球比赛大会于十月十二日在北京开幕。参加这次大会的有各大行政区及中国火车头体育协会等七个单位的男女运动员六十二人。参加开幕式的有中央人民政府教育部部长、中华全国体育总会主席马叙伦，青年团中央委员会书记处书记、中华全国体育总会副主席荣高棠，中华全国体育总会代理秘书长黄中。此外，正在北京参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的世界和平理事会书记、世界乒乓球协会主席蒙塔古也到会。
    会上，中华全国体育总会主席马叙伦致开幕词。他说：“举行全国性单项的乒乓球比赛大会，说明了共产党和人民政府对体育运动的重视。通过此次大会，必将促使我国乒乓球运动进一步地发展与提高。同时，要选拔出全国第一批乒乓球选手，代表我国参加将在今年十一月在新加坡举行的第一届亚洲乒乓球锦标赛。”他并指出：“我国大规模的经济建设就要开始了，而美帝国主义仍占领我们的国土台湾，继续破坏朝鲜停战谈判，阴谋扩大侵略战争。让我们努力发展体育运动，锻炼身体，为祖国的建设事业，为亚洲与世界和平贡献我们最大的力量。”
    蒙塔古接着讲话。他说：中国乒乓球技术是在世界上最好的国家之一，解放后新中国人民的每件事情进步都很快，因此我相信新中国的乒乓球运动的进步也会很快。最后他说：下次的世界乒乓球比赛将在布加勒斯特举行，我相信全世界的乒乓球运动员一定愿意和你们做朋友，和你们在一起比赛。欢迎你们的运动员能够参加。
