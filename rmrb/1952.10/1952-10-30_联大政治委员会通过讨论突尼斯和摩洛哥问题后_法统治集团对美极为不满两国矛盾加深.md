Xinhua News Agency, October 29th:  In light of the rising sentiment in the United Nations General Assembly against French imperialism's brutal suppression of the North African colonial liberation movement, the U.S. representative to the United Nations, at the meeting of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the 22nd, voted in favor of including the Tunisian and Moroccan issues on the second and third items of the agenda. The U.S. representative attempted to use this hypocritical gesture to win over Asian and Arab countries and to sabotage the discussion of the Tunisian and Moroccan issues by more insidious means. However, this action by the United States aroused great resentment from the French ruling clique and further deepened the contradiction between the U.S. and French ruling cliques.

It is well known that the U.S. ruling clique has always advocated racial discrimination, maintained the colonial system, and opposed the colonial liberation movement. People have not forgotten the shameful record of the United States cruelly oppressing black people at home and enslaving other countries and suppressing colonial liberation movements abroad. In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on the 16th of this month, Acheson further exposed the U.S. ruling clique's hatred for the colonial liberation movement. When Acheson spoke about the issue of dependent peoples demanding autonomy, he used rogue-like tones to demand that United Nations member states not meddle in racial discrimination and colonial oppression, saying: "If we search ourselves, each of us can discover the domestic shame of racial, class, and religious discrimination. If that is the case, it is wrong for us to adopt a sanctimonious attitude toward the errors of our neighbors..." However, in the face of the growing colonial liberation movement, the United States did not dare to express its opposition head-on, fearing that this would further isolate it in the United Nations, and adopted cunning tactics, attempting to win people over with a posture of agreeing to discussions, and then sabotage the discussions, so that the United Nations General Assembly would not achieve any results in the discussions of the Tunisian and Moroccan issues. Acheson had stated in the same speech that the United Nations could "discuss," "consider," and "constantly seek solutions," "but does not necessarily have to make a resolution." The U.S. Embassy in Paris stated even more clearly: "The U.S. government's intentions will not change in any way because of this vote—the United States will support France when discussing the substance of this issue."

However, the French ruling clique could not understand the "predicament" of the United States. They feared that the discussions would expose the truth of France's brutal rule in the colonies to world opinion. A spokesman for the French delegation to the United Nations General Assembly said: The United States' action was surprising and unexpected. Subsequently, a spokesman for the French Embassy in the United States announced on the 24th that the French Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, had telephoned U.S. Under Secretary of State Bruce to lodge a strong verbal protest, saying: "We don't like the American vote," and expressing concern that this American action would stimulate French bourgeois public opinion and the North African national liberation movement, thereby causing unfortunate repercussions. At the same time, French President Auriol also stated in front of U.S. Ambassador Dunn and other foreign diplomats on the 25th that France was "extremely indignant" that the United Nations was interrogating it under the guise of discussing France's oppression of Tunisia and Morocco. Auriol also complained that the money France had spent on the Indochina War was "more than double the benefits it had received from the Marshall Plan and military aid programs."

The bourgeois newspapers in Paris generally expressed anger at the actions of the United States. "Le Figaro" published a commentary entitled "A Painful Vote," saying that the United States' doing so "has a tendency to be hostile to France," thereby exposing the contradictions between the countries of the Atlantic Group. The Gaullist "Combat" even believed that "the period of small wars between France and the United States, and between the United States and Europe, has begun," and openly declared that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was a conspiracy and a deception. In addition to expressing dissatisfaction with the United States, the Radical Socialist Party's "L'Aurore" also called for "a close alliance between France and Britain" to "defend their rights in Africa."

    联大政治委员会通过讨论突尼斯和摩洛哥问题后
    法统治集团对美极为不满两国矛盾加深
    【新华社二十九日讯】出席联合国的美国代表，鉴于联合国大会中反对法帝国主义野蛮镇压北非殖民地解放运动的情绪的高涨，在联合国大会政治委员会二十二日会议上，投票赞成把突尼斯和摩洛哥问题列入第二项与第三项议程。美国代表企图以这种假惺惺的姿态，来拉拢亚洲和阿拉伯国家，并以更阴险的手段来破坏突尼斯和摩洛哥问题的讨论。然而，美国此举却引起了法国统治集团极大的反感，并使美、法统治集团之间的矛盾进一步加深。
    尽人皆知，美国统治集团一向是提倡种族歧视、维护殖民制度，反对殖民地解放运动的。美国在国内残酷地压迫黑人、在国外奴役他国和镇压殖民地解放运动的可耻纪录，人们并没有忘记。本月十六日艾奇逊在联合国大会发表的演说里，进一步暴露出美国统治集团对于殖民地解放运动的仇视。艾奇逊在谈到附属国人民要求自治的问题时，用流氓的腔调要求联合国会员国不要过问种族歧视和殖民压迫，他说：“我们反躬自问，每个人都能发现种族、阶级与宗教歧视的家丑。假使是如此的话，我们对于我们邻国的错误采取假道学的态度……就是不对的。”但是，美国在日益壮大的殖民地解放运动面前，不敢正面表示反对，害怕这样会使它在联合国中更加孤立，而采取了狡猾的手段，企图以同意讨论的姿态来笼络人心，然后在讨论中进行破坏，使联合国大会对于突尼斯和摩洛哥问题的讨论得不到任何结果。艾奇逊在同一篇演说里即曾表示，联合国可以“讨论”、“考虑”，“经常寻求解决”，“但是并不一定要作出决议”。美国驻巴黎大使馆说得更明白：“美国政府的意图决不因这次投票而有所改变——美国将要在讨论这一问题的实质的时候，支持法国。”
    但是，法国统治集团却不能谅解美国的“苦衷”。他们害怕在讨论中会使法国在殖民地的暴虐统治的真相全部暴露于世界舆论面前。法国出席联合国大会代表团发言人说：美国这样作是令人惊讶和意想不到的。接着，法国驻美国大使馆发言人又在二十四日宣布：法国驻美国大使庞纳已经就这件事打电话向美国副国务卿勃鲁斯提出强硬的口头抗议说：“我们不喜欢美国的票”，并且担心美国这种行动会刺激法国资产阶级舆论和北非民族解放运动，从而造成不幸的反响。同时，法国总统阿里奥尔在二十五日也当着美国大使邓恩和其他国家外交人员的面表示：法国对于联合国以讨论法国压迫突尼斯和摩洛哥的罪名来审讯它一事，“极为愤慨”。阿里奥尔并且抱怨说：法国在印度支那战争中所花去的钱，比法国“从马歇尔计划和军事援助计划中所获得的利益还要大一倍”。
    巴黎的资产阶级报纸普遍对美国的行动表示愤怒。“费加罗报”以“痛心的一票”为题，发表评论说：美国这样做“就有敌对法国的倾向”，从而暴露了大西洋集团国家之间的矛盾。戴高乐分子的
    “战斗报”甚至认为“法国和美国、美国和欧洲间进行小战争的时期开始了”，并公然宣布北大西洋公约是个阴谋和欺骗。激进社会党的“震旦报”除了对美国表示不满外，还号召“法国和英国紧密联盟”，来“保卫它们在非洲的权利”。
