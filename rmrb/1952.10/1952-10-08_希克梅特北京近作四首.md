    Hikmet's Recent Works in Beijing, Four Poems
    Pavilion of Knowing Spring
    The Pavilion of Knowing Spring on Kunming Lake is beautifully dreamlike,
    The despotic Empress Dowager Cixi once wore a yellow robe here to enjoy the spring.
    Now I am also here watching yachts passing through the lotus flowers,
    The song "The East is Red" is heard on the lake.
    Clever and Strong
    The Longevity Hill is full of exquisitely carved marble, ivory and ebony,
    They become as soft as brocade in the hands of craftsmen.
    I saw Beijing girls in blue uniforms,
    Also have the same hands, clever and strong.
    October 1, 1950 and the Martyrs Before the Winter Palace
    Beijing is dressed up like a golden tulip.
    A brilliant crowd flows through Tiananmen Square,
    The arid land will be irrigated and fertilized by this long river.
    The martyr who first fell before the Winter Palace, the Bolshevik Ivan,
    Stands beside Mao Zedong and gazes affectionately.
    The New Great Wall
    I saw the New China's Great Wall,
    The bricks and stones are the millions of united people.
    Its gate is open to friends,
    Before the enemy can climb close to the steps, his head is broken. (Translated by Yuan Shuipai)

    希克梅特北京近作四首
    知春亭
    昆明湖上的知春亭美丽得有如梦境，
    专横的慈禧曾穿着黄袍在这里赏春。
    如今我也在这里看游艇穿过荷花，
    湖上传来了“东方红”的歌声。
    聪明又强悍
    万寿山到处有精雕的大理石、象牙和黑檀，
    它们在匠师的手里变得柔如锦缎。
    我看见穿着蓝制服的北京女郎，
    也有同样的手，聪明又强悍。
    一九五○年十月一日和冬宫前的英烈
    北京打扮得好像一朵金枝的郁金香。
    灿烂的人群流过天安门广场，
    干旱的土地将被这长河灌溉肥壮。
    那冬宫前最先倒下的英烈，布尔什维克伊凡，
    站在毛泽东身边亲热地眺望。
    新的长城
    我看见了新中国的长城，
    那砖石就是千千万万团结的人民。
    它的大门为朋友而开，
    敌人还没有爬近台阶，就折断了他的头颈。（袁水拍译）
