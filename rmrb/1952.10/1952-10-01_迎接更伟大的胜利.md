    Welcoming Even Greater Victories
    Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Zhang Bojun
    The third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China! I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations on the glorious achievements of the new China's construction and the great victories of the Chinese people on all fronts in the past three years.
    Now is a historical era in which the people of the world are demanding total liberation. Like an object falling to the ground, the closer it gets to the ground, the faster its speed doubles. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China are the greatest victories in the history of human progress since the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union and the anti-fascist World War. It has influenced the historical destiny of people of all the world, especially the oppressed nations of Asia, and inspired the fighting will and confidence in victory of the world's people in their struggle for liberation. It has further changed the balance of power between the two major camps in the world. The unbreakable alliance of friendship and mutual assistance between the victorious peoples of the two major countries, China and the Soviet Union, possesses the conditions to defeat any enemy. This is the guarantee of the victory of the world's people in their struggle for lasting peace and people's democracy, and it is also the decisive force for reversing the course of human history toward brightness.
    Now, after completing the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the Soviet people are confidently moving towards communist construction in accordance with the general goal of the new Five-Year Plan. The people's democratic countries in Europe have successfully embarked on the road of building socialism. National liberation struggles in Asia and North Africa are also flourishing. The world people's movement to defend peace is unfolding even more widely and deeply. The Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference held in Beijing, and the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna in December this year, demonstrate the great and unstoppable unity of the world's people. Conversely, within the imperialist aggressive camp, internal contradictions are deepening, production is declining, living conditions are becoming poorer, the number of unemployed is increasing, and social morality is deteriorating, brewing a total crisis of economic bankruptcy. A very small number of monopoly capitalists and a handful of corrupt and declining ruling groups are like sitting on a volcano about to erupt. This forms a stark contrast in the current world.
    China's new democratic society is developing rapidly. The people of the whole country are working with courageous and diligent attitudes, and are tempering themselves and creating their own history in one revolutionary movement after another. First of all, the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement is a revolutionary practice against imperialism. Our heroic People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army have achieved brilliant victories on the Korean front, defending the security of China and Korea and peace in the Far East and the world, piercing through the paper tiger of American imperialism, and at the same time greatly improving the Chinese people's patriotic and internationalist political consciousness. The land reform movement is a revolutionary practice against feudalism, enabling more than 400 million farmers to obtain land, thereby abolishing the feudal exploitation system that has existed for thousands of years, liberating rural productive forces, and opening up roads for the industrialization of the new China. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries is the dictatorship over class enemies, completely eliminating the enemies existing within, and consolidating the people's democratic regime. The Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements repelled the frenzied attacks of illegal bourgeois elements, eradicated bureaucratic capitalism and the "Three Evils" and "Five Poisons" left over from the old society, and laid a good foundation for economic construction, democratic reform, and ideological remoulding. On the ideological front, the ideological remoulding movement, which runs through various movements, is being widely carried out in all classes and departments across the country. Everyone is working hard to study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong Thought, and is willing to serve the people wholeheartedly, and hopes to successfully enter socialist and communist society in the future.
    Regarding the people's construction undertakings, we have achieved unprecedentedly great achievements. The financial, economic, cultural and educational departments have not only basically completed the restoration and transformation work, but some achievements have already exceeded the highest records in history. Looking at the construction undertakings in water conservancy, railways, transportation, industry, agriculture, forestry, mining, and metallurgy, the working people have all displayed high labor enthusiasm and created many miracles. Taking the transportation industry in the past three years as an example, we have destroyed the semi-feudal and semi-colonial transportation system, and transformed the transportation tools that were used by imperialism and domestic reactionary governments for aggression, exploitation, and war in the past into transportation undertakings serving the people.
    Due to the ever-increasing political consciousness and learning craze of the people of the whole country, everyone is eager to acquire new knowledge and understand new things, and the universal improvement of material life and cultural level is creating conditions for this demand. Therefore, the news and publishing industry has greatly developed along with various social reform movements. The total circulation of various newspapers has reached more than seven million copies, and the number of books and periodicals published nationwide will reach 800 million copies.
    The democratic parties participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are components of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they jointly shoulder the great political task of building a new China. The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has had more than twenty years of struggle history, and the China Democratic League has also had more than ten years of struggle history. They have each made certain contributions to the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle and the overthrow of the reactionary regime headed by Chiang Kai-shek. Since the founding of the new China, the comrades of the entire League and the entire Party have actively participated in the three major movements of Resisting America, Aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and the ideological remoulding movement, and everyone's political and ideological level has been greatly improved. Now they are consolidating and developing their organizations, striving to consolidate and expand the People's Democratic United Front, thoroughly realize the Common Program, and complete the glorious task of national construction.
    Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the new China is moving from victory to victory. As for myself, I have received many educations and transformations in various movements. In the above-mentioned work I have participated in, due to the frequent leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the efforts of cadres, and the help of the masses, I have also achieved the above-mentioned achievements, which is glorious to me. I am welcoming and celebrating this great National Day with extremely joyful and excited feelings! In the future, I am willing to further temper myself, transform myself, and work more actively on the basis of victory, and welcome even greater victories.

    迎接更伟大的胜利
    中国农工民主党主席   章伯钧
    中华人民共和国成立三周年了！谨对新中国建设的辉煌成就和中国人民三年来在各个战线上的伟大胜利，表示衷心的祝贺。
    现在是世界人民要求总解放的历史时代，如同物体坠地一样，愈接近地面，速度就愈加倍的大。中国人民大革命的胜利，中华人民共和国的成立，是苏联十月社会主义革命和反法西斯世界大战胜利后的人类进步史上最伟大的胜利。它影响了全世界，特别是亚洲被压迫民族人民的历史命运，鼓舞了世界人民要求解放的斗争意志和胜利信心，更进一步地改变了世界两大阵营的力量的对比。胜利了的中苏两大国家人民牢不可破的友好互助同盟，具备了战胜任何敌人的条件，就是世界人民争取持久和平争取人民民主的胜利保证，也就是扭转人类历史走向光明的决定力量。
    现在苏联人民在提前完成战后五年计划之后，正按着新五年计划的总目标，满怀信心地向着共产主义建设迈进。欧洲各人民民主国家已胜利地走上建设社会主义的道路。亚洲和北非的民族解放斗争也都蓬蓬勃勃地起来了。世界人民保卫和平运动是更加广泛更加深入地展开了。即在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，和将在本年十二月在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会，正说明了世界人民的伟大的不可阻挠的团结。反之，在帝国主义侵略阵营方面，则是内部矛盾加深，生产衰退，生活穷困，失业人数增加，社会道德堕落，正在孕育着经济破产的总危机，极少数的独占资本家和一小撮腐朽没落的统治集团就好比坐在快要爆发的火山上。这在当前世界恰好成一个强烈的对照。
    中国新民主主义社会是在飞跃地发展着。全国人民是以勇敢而勤劳的姿态工作着，并在一个又一个的革命运动中，锻炼着自己，创造着自己的历史。首先，抗美援朝运动是反帝国主义的革命实践，我们英勇的人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜前线取得了辉煌战绩，保卫了中朝两国的安全与远东及世界的和平，戳穿了美帝国主义的纸老虎，同时又大大提高了中国人民爱国主义与国际主义相结合的政治觉悟。土地改革运动是反封建主义的革命实践，使四亿以上的农民得到了土地，从而废除了几千年来的封建剥削制度，解放农村生产力，为新中国的工业化开辟道路。镇压反革命运动是对阶级敌人的专政，彻底消灭了内部存在着的敌人，巩固了人民民主政权。增产节约及“三反”“五反”运动，打退了资产阶级不法分子的猖狂进攻，肃清了官僚资本主义和旧社会遗留下来的“三害”“五毒”思想，为经济建设和民主改革以及思想改造奠定了良好基础。在思想战线上，贯彻于各个运动之间思想改造运动，正在全国各阶层各部门广泛展开，每个人都努力学习着马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东思想，愿全心全意为人民服务，并希望将来都能胜利地迈进社会主义和共产主义社会。
    关于人民的建设事业，我们已获得史无前例的巨大成就，财经文教各部门不仅基本上完成了恢复改造工作，而且有些成就已经超过了历史上的最高纪录。试看水利、铁路、交通、工业、农林、矿冶各方面的建设事业，劳动人民都发挥了高度的劳动热情，创造了不少的奇迹。以三年来的交通运输事业为例：我们摧毁了半封建半殖民地性质的交通制度，把过去被帝国主义国内反动政府用作侵略压榨和战争的交通工具，改变为服务于人民的交通运输事业。
    由于全国人民日益提高的政治觉悟和学习热潮，大家都渴望取得新知识，明白新事物，而物质生活和文化水平之普遍提高，正为这一要求创造了条件。于是新闻出版事业随着各个社会改革运动而大大发展了，各类报纸的总发行额已达到七百万份以上，全国书刊出版数字将达到八万万册。
    参加中国人民政治协商会议的各民主党派，是中国人民民主统一战线的组成部分，在中国共产党领导下，共同担负了建设新中国的伟大的政治任务。中国农工民主党已经有二十几年的斗争历史，中国民主同盟也已经有十余年斗争史了，对反帝反封建并推翻以蒋介石为首的反动政权，都各有其一定的贡献。新中国成立以来，全盟和全党同志都积极参加了抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动，“三反”“五反”运动以及思想改造运动，大家的政治思想水平都大大地提高了；现在正巩固和发展自己的组织，为巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，彻底实现共同纲领和完成国家建设的光荣任务而努力。
    新中国在英明的毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，是从胜利走向胜利的。就我自己来说，在各个运动中，得到了许许多多的教育和改造；在我所参加的上述各方面的工作，由于经常获得毛主席和共产党的领导，干部的努力，和群众的帮助，也获得了如上所述的成就，这对我是光荣的。我是以极欢欣和感奋的心情来迎接并庆祝这个伟大的国庆节！愿今后在胜利的基础上，再锻炼自己，改造自己，更积极地工作，迎接更伟大的胜利。
