    Quickly Solve the Water Shortage Problem for the Masses in the Fourth District of Pinglu County

    Comrade Editor: The Fourth District of Pinglu County, Chahar Province, is an old revolutionary base area. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the area was repeatedly devastated by the Japanese invaders and suffered heavy losses. The biggest difficulty for the local people now is the lack of drinking water. In order to support the production and construction of the old base area, in addition to issuing various disaster relief funds, grain loans, and loans to the county, the Yanbei Commissioner's Office specifically allocated 60,000 jin of millet for well-digging to the county this spring. However, up to now (September 11th), the county people's government has not distributed this batch of well-digging grain to the masses, which has caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. Taking Xiaoshagou Village in the Fourth District of the county as an example, the water problem is the first major problem that the people of the village have been demanding to solve for many years, but it has not been solved yet. When I came to work in this village, the masses did not talk about anything else. The first major thing they asked the government to do was to solve the drinking water problem no matter what. The masses unanimously demanded: as long as the government solves the drinking water problem for us, we are not afraid of anything else. The village has a total of 109 people, 37 large livestock, and 17 pigs, but only two wells with very little water. Every day, each household has to send one or two laborers to fetch water. One person scoops water in the well, and the other hoists it up. Many people get up before dawn to line up for water. Those who go early can scoop up some thick mud, and those who go late cannot even scoop up mud. This bucket of mud is carried home and used for human consumption, animal drinking, and pig feeding. Sometimes, even mud cannot be scooped up from these two wells, so they have to run five miles to the spring to carry water, which has a greater impact on labor and production. I saw with my own eyes a sixteen-year-old girl whose back was bent from carrying water all day long. The county leaders are indifferent to such a major issue related to the lives of the masses, holding the well-digging grain in their hands, neither distributing it to the masses nor trying to find a way to solve the water problem. Hao Guangwen, the former secretary of the Pinglu County Party Committee, Wang Jingui, the current secretary of the Pinglu County Party Committee, and Chen, the deputy county magistrate of the county, have all visited the village this year. In particular, the organization minister of the Pinglu County Party Committee lived in the village for nearly half a year and was fully aware of the difficulties of the masses in the village without water to drink. I believe that this is a manifestation of bureaucratic work style of indifference to the people of the old base area. The comrades concerned in the county should not only quickly distribute the well-digging grain to the masses to solve the drinking water problem of the masses, but also conduct a profound self-criticism.

    Editor's Note: The Pinglu County People's Government not only fails to find a way to solve the drinking water problem that the masses in the Fourth District of the county have been urgently demanding for many years, but also withholds the well-digging grain allocated by the Commissioner's Office for a long time. This erroneous behavior of not caring about the lives of the masses shows that the leading cadres of the county do not truly understand the idea of relying on the masses and serving the masses. Because of not caring about the masses and not solving the practical problems in the lives of the masses, the result of leadership being divorced from the masses will inevitably occur. This is the greatest danger in our work and should arouse high vigilance.

    Reader Li Tingxuan discovered the above situation in his work, promptly reported it, and made serious criticisms of the party and government leading cadres of the county, which is entirely correct. We hope that the party and government leading cadres of Pinglu County will accept the opinions of the masses, quickly distribute the well-digging grain, organize the masses to dig wells in a leadership-oriented manner, and make a public self-criticism and explanation in this newspaper for the erroneous behavior of not caring about the lives of the masses in the past.

### 迅速解决平鲁县四区群众的缺水问题

    迅速解决平鲁县四区群众的缺水问题
    编辑同志：察哈尔省平鲁县四区是革命老根据地。在抗日战争时期，该区屡经日寇摧残，损失惨重。当地人民现在最大的困难，是没有水喝。为了扶助老区人民的生产建设，人民政府除对该县发放了各种救灾款和贷粮、贷款外，雁北专署特别在今年春季拨给该县打井粮小米六万斤；但到现在（九月十一日），县人民政府还没有把这批打井粮发到群众手里，引起了群众很大不满。单以该县四区小沙沟村来说，吃水问题就是该村人民多年来要求解决而到现在还没有解决的第一个大问题。我到这个村工作时，群众没有谈别的事，开头一件大事就要求政府无论如何给解决吃水问题。群众一致要求是：只要政府给我们把吃水问题解决了，别的什么也不怕。该村共一百零九口人，三十七个大牲口，十七口猪，只有两眼井，水很少，每天每户要抽出一个至两个劳动力去打水。一个人在井下用勺子舀，一个在井上吊。很多人不到天亮就起来排队打水，去的早的舀些稠泥糊糊，去得迟的连泥糊糊还舀不上。这桶泥糊糊背到家里，人吃的，牲口饮的，喂猪的都靠它。有时候这两眼井连泥糊糊也没有了，就得跑五里远的路到泉上去背水，劳动生产要受到更大的影响。我亲眼看见一个十六岁的小姑娘，因为成天背水，连腰也压得弯起来了。对这样一件有关群众生活的大事情，该县领导上却漠不关心，把打井粮压在手里，不发给群众，也不给想办法解决吃水问题。该县前任中共县委书记郝光文同志、现任中共县委书记王金贵同志和该县陈副县长今年都曾先后到过该村，特别是该县中共县委会的组织部长在这个村住了将近半年，对该村群众没水吃的困难是完全知道的。我认为这是对老区人民漠不关心的官僚主义作风的表现。该县有关同志除应很快地把打井粮发到群众手里，解决群众的吃水问题外，并应作深刻检讨。李廷选
    编者按：平鲁县人民政府不但不设法解决该县四区群众多年来迫切要求解决的喝水问题，反而把专署拨下的打井粮长期扣压。这种不关心群众生活的错误行为，说明该县领导干部并没有真正懂得依靠群众和为了群众的思想。由于不关心群众，不解决群众实际生活中的问题，必然会发生领导脱离群众的结果，这是我们工作中的最大危险，应该引起高度的警惕。
    读者李廷选在工作中发现了上述情况，及时反映并对该县党、政领导干部提出严正的批评，这是完全正确的。我们希望平鲁县党、政领导干部接受群众意见，迅速发放打井粮，有领导地组织群众打井，并对过去不关心群众生活的错误行为在本报进行公开的检讨和说明。
