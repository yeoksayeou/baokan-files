Mr. Chairman, Delegates and Friends!

On behalf of the peace-loving people of Ceylon, I salute this historic conference!

Before I present my report, I would like to clarify that after the informative reports on this topic given to you this morning by previous speakers, I do not need to address the general issues of this topic. I will confine myself to aspects of particular significance to Ceylon.

One of the direct and immediate consequences of war preparations and the "Cold War" is the disruption of normal trade relations between countries. It is a recognized fact that establishing mutually beneficial trade relations between countries can help maintain peace.

Today, the increasing tension of war in the world has divided countries into various blocs. Trade relations between these blocs have shrunk to such an extent that the economies of some countries have suffered tragic consequences. In order to achieve its aggressive aims, the U.S. government has pursued a policy of trade blockade against countries that refuse to follow it. The U.S. not only refuses to trade with countries whose ideologies and political systems it dislikes, but also uses its economic dominance after World War II to force other countries to stop trading with those countries, otherwise they will not receive U.S. economic aid. These countries, due to war and long-term colonial exploitation, have suffered economic damage and are in dire need of economic assistance from more advanced countries.

A one-sided trade policy has had extremely adverse effects on the economies of the countries concerned. Let us use the example of Ceylon to illustrate this point. The majority of our trade is linked to Britain and the United States, which until 1950 were our main customers for our main exports, and from whom we obtained what we needed. This relationship, of course, is the relationship of a colonial country exporting its raw materials in exchange for consumer goods from the empire. Even this trade relationship, which inevitably perpetuates our colonial and dependent status, has been affected by the intensified war preparations of these countries.

The plans of these countries to increase military production and the transition of their economies to war economies mean that they cannot supply us with enough essential imports, such as food, or even the very small amount of production equipment needed for their much-publicized plans to develop backward countries. At the same time, the prices they pay for our exports are constantly falling compared to the prices of the goods they ship to us.

For example, rubber is one of our main exports, and the United States buys most of our rubber. However, recently it has used its monopoly as the main customer for our rubber to force down prices. Unless we lower prices, it refuses to buy our rubber. As a result, the amount of rubber imported by the United States has fallen sharply. The value of Ceylonese rubber sold to the United States fell from 29.4 million rupees in December 1950 to 2.5 million rupees in September 1951.

This will naturally have an adverse impact on our economy. The prices of rubber and other exports affected in the same way have fallen sharply. Our national income mainly depends on the export of three main commodities – tea, rubber and cocoa. Bearing this in mind, it is understandable that a fall in the price of any of these commodities would seriously affect our entire economy. In the past, falling rubber prices have often been a signal to reduce wages, tighten budgets and cancel other social programs. As a result of the aforementioned fall in rubber prices, employers in the rubber and tea industries have already planned to reduce workers' wages by 38 percent. If the situation continues to deteriorate, there is no doubt that it will lead to the closure of the rubber industry and mass unemployment.

However, the problem is not insoluble; today there are other markets for our exports. It is only because of the "Cold War" that we are forbidden to trade with countries such as the Soviet Union and New China, which need to buy our goods and can also sell us what we need. The U.S. government has threatened Ceylon that if it trades with the Soviet Union or New China, the United States will stop all forms of economic aid.

However, recently, due to mass pressure, the Ceylon government has been forced to stop obstructing the sale of rubber to the aforementioned countries. As a result, our rubber trade with these countries has increased. Last year, China became the largest buyer of Ceylonese rubber. This is the main factor that has prevented rubber prices from plummeting, and has therefore at least helped Ceylon avoid a collapse.

The relationship between our sales of rubber to China and its impact on rubber prices can be illustrated by an example. On September 18th this year, a Polish ship loaded rubber in Colombo to be transported to China. At that time, the price of Grade 1 rubber was 1.6 rupees. On the same morning, after the agent buying rubber for China left the market, the market price immediately fell to 1.15 rupees, equivalent to the world price. In the afternoon, after the agent buying rubber for China entered the market, the price immediately rose back to 1.6 rupees. This proves that our rubber not only has other sales channels, but also a profitable one.

The situation is similar with our food imports. Our food supply depends on imports for two-thirds of our needs. Recently, due to unstable domestic conditions in the exporting countries, and due to the United States buying up rice with dollars, our rice supply is insufficient. Due to insufficient supply, our government has had to find alternative sources of rice supply. Despite U.S. opposition, mass pressure has once again forced the Ceylon government to turn to importing rice from New China. Currently, a Ceylonese trade delegation is in Beijing to discuss the issue of China supplying Ceylon with rice. This is a contribution to maintaining peace in Asia. Ceylon has rubber to sell to China, and China has rice to supply to Ceylon; what could be more natural and mutually beneficial than exchanging these goods?

Another issue affecting the people of colonial and dependent countries is the import of production equipment. After centuries of colonial exploitation, the only path these countries can develop is through industrialization. Therefore, they need production equipment, but the Anglo-American bloc of countries refuses to ship these things to colonial and dependent countries. Obviously, this is because they want to continue to make these countries only produce raw materials and become dumping markets for their consumer goods. However, this policy is against the interests of the people of these countries.

The imperialists have of course also formulated high-sounding plans such as the Colombo Plan. However, a brief examination of this plan reveals its nature. Let's take a look at the Colombo Plan. The basis of this plan is to expect the United States to provide funds. Now it is more obvious than ever that the United States is not interested in any financial assistance. This is the same with the Fourth Point Aid Program – this plan was not even serious and has not been implemented.

Today, from a financial point of view, what we can rely on under the Colombo Plan is the hope that the British government will unfreeze the sterling balances that should be paid to us, and return this money to us in the form of loans. This is the Colombo Plan. The Colombo Plan is merely the British government lending us a portion of our own money to engage in our own development. Our sterling balances were accumulated in Britain during the war, and part of them are frozen in Account No. 2. Now they are being transferred bit by bit from Account No. 2 to Account No. 1, and we are withdrawing them from Account No. 1. This is a summary account of the bankrupt Colombo Plan.

It must also be noted that all the various programs in the Colombo Plan are based on the principle of not changing our economic dependence. Its various programs are related to improving transportation and agriculture. None of them allow for the development of our industry. The report of the International Bank Mission even suggested opposing all forms of industrial development, and did not even approve of large-scale agricultural plans. This is part of the imperialist policy of making colonial countries subordinate to other countries. When people point this out, our government states the difficulty of obtaining production equipment. In fact, only the group of countries that are busy manufacturing armaments today and therefore cannot manufacture production equipment have this difficulty. But we know that at the recent meeting of the Asian and Far Eastern Economic Commission in Rangoon, the Soviet representative proposed to supply us with machinery and other items we need. But due to U.S. pressure and its embargo on trade with half the world, our government did not accept this suggestion.

It is clear that only full and free exchange of economies and trade between countries on the basis of mutually beneficial relations can not only reduce the danger of war, but also enable the more backward countries to develop. We must, on behalf of our peace movement, do our best to force our government to further disregard the trade embargo imposed by the United States and establish trade and friendly relations with all countries. We are very pleased that we were able to send a delegation from Ceylon to the International Economic Conference in Moscow, which resulted in increased trade between Ceylon and Western European countries, the Soviet Union and China.

Finally, I warmly support the recommendations contained in the previous report.

### 锡兰代表维昆塔瓦桑  关于经济交流的补充报告

    锡兰代表维昆塔瓦桑
    关于经济交流的补充报告主席先生，代表们及朋友们！
    我代表爱好和平的锡兰人民，向这个历史性的会议致敬！
    在我提出我的报告以前，我想说明，在以前的发言者在今天上午向你们作了关于这个题目的内容丰富的报告以后，我就不需要涉及关于这个题目的一般性的问题。我只限于谈一些对于锡兰特别有意义的方面。
    战争准备和“冷战”的直接的立即的后果之一就是使世界各国间的正常贸易关系脱节。各国间建立互利的贸易关系可以帮助保持和平，这是大家承认的事实。
    今天，世界上战争的紧张局势的加剧，使世界各国分成了各个集团。这些集团间的贸易关系缩减到这样的程度以致有些国家的经济遭受到悲惨的后果。美国政府为了达到它的侵略目的，对那些拒绝追随它的国家推行了封锁贸易的政策。美国不但本身拒绝和那些思想及政治制度不合它意的国家进行贸易，而且利用它在第二次世界大战以后的经济统治地位，强迫其他国家停止和那些国家进行贸易，不然它们就得不到美国的经济援助，而它们由于战争，由于长期的殖民剥削，经济已遭破坏，因此极需比较先进的国家给以经济援助。
    单线贸易政策使那些有关国家的经济受到极为不利的影响。让我们用锡兰的例子来说明这一点。我国的贸易大部分是与英国和美国有联系的，到一九五零年止，它们一直是我们主要输出品的老主顾，我们则从它们那里获得我们所需要的东西。这中间的关系，当然是一个殖民地国家输出它的原料从帝国换得所需的消费品的关系。甚至这种势必把我们的殖民地和附属国地位永远保持下去的贸易关系，也受到了这些国家加紧战争准备的影响。
    这些国家的增加军备生产的计划和它们的经济的走上战争经济的轨道，都意味着它们并不能供应我们足够的必需进口货，如食品等，甚至它们大事宣传的开发落后国家计划所需要的极少一点生产装备也是这样。同时，他们付给我们的输出品的价格，和他们运给我们的物品的价格比较起来，是在不断地下跌。
    举例来说，橡胶是我国的主要输出品之一，美国购买了我国橡胶的大部分。但是最近它利用它是我国橡胶的主要主顾的独占地位，强制压低价格。除非我们降低价格，它就拒绝购买我国的橡胶。结果，美国进口的橡胶数量急速下降。卖给美国的锡兰橡胶的价值，在一九五零年十二月，是二千九百四十万卢比，到一九五一年九月，下降到二百五十万卢比。
    这对于我国经济自然会产生不利的影响。橡胶和其他受到同样影响的出口货物的价格，都急速下降了。我国国民收入主要依靠三项主要货物——茶、橡胶和可可——的输出。想到这一点，就可以理解这些货物中任何一种的价格下降，都会严重地影响我国整个经济。在过去，橡胶价格下落常常是减低工资，紧缩和取消其他社会事业的信号。前述橡胶价格下降的结果，橡胶工业和茶业的雇主们已经打算把工人的工资减少百分之三十八。如果情况继续恶化，毫无疑问将会使橡胶业歇业和大批人失业。
    不过问题并不是不能解决的，今天我们的出口货还有其他市场。只是因为“冷战”的关系，我们被禁止与苏联、新中国等国家进行贸易，而他们需要购买我们的货物，同时也能卖给我们所需要的东西。美国政府曾经威胁锡兰，如果与苏联或新中国进行贸易，美国就停止所有各种方式的经济援助。
    但是，最近由于群众的压力，锡兰政府被迫不再阻挠运销橡胶给上述国家。因此，我们和这些国家的橡胶交易额有了增加。去年，中国成为锡兰橡胶的最大买主。这就是使得橡胶价格免于惨跌的主要因素，因此至少帮助锡兰避免一次崩溃。
    我们向中国销售橡胶及其对橡胶价格的影响两者之间的关系，可举一个例子来说明。今年九月十八日，有一艘波兰船在科伦坡载运橡胶到中国去。当时一号橡胶的价格是一点六卢比。同日上午，代中国购买橡胶的经纪人走出市场后，市场价格马上跌到一点一五卢比，相当于世界价格。下午，代中国购买橡胶的经纪人进入市场后，价格又立刻回升到一点六卢比。这就证明我国橡胶不但另有销路，而且是一个有利可图的销路。
    我们的食品输入，情形也是这样。我国三分之二的食品要依靠输入。最近由于输出国国内情形动荡不定，同时由于美国用美元搜购大米，我们的大米供应不足。由于供应不足，我国政府不得不设法另觅大米供应的来源。尽管美国反对，群众的压力再一次地迫使锡兰政府转向新中国输入大米。目前正有一个锡兰贸易代表团在北京商谈中国以大米供应锡兰的问题。这对于维护亚洲和平是一种贡献。锡兰有橡胶可以卖给中国，而中国有大米可以供给锡兰；还有什么比我们交换这些货物更自然和更互相有利呢？
    另一个影响殖民地和附属国人民的问题便是生产设备的输入问题。经过几世纪的殖民地剥削，这些国家能够发展的唯一的道路便是工业化的道路。因此，他们需要生产设备，而英美集团国家恰恰就拒绝将这些东西运往殖民地和附属国。显然，这当然是因为他们要继续使这些国家只出产原料和成为他们消费品的倾销市场。然而这种政策却是违反这些国家的人民的利益的。
    帝国主义者当然也订出了像科伦坡计划之类的唱高调的计划。然而只要把这计划稍一检视，就可以看出它们的本质。让我们来看看科伦坡计划吧。这个计划的基础是指望美国会供给资金。现在事情再明显不过，美国对于任何财政资助并不感到兴趣。就是第四点援助计划——这个计划根本就不是当真的，也没有实现。
    今天，从财政的观点来看，我们在科伦坡计划下所能依赖的，便是希望英国政府会解冻应当付给我们的英镑结存，用贷款形式把这笔钱还给我们。这便是科伦坡计划。科伦坡计划只不过是英国政府把我们的一部分钱借给我们从事我们自己的开发。我们的英镑结存是在战争期间在英国累积起来的，其中一部分冻结在第二号帐上。现在它们正点点滴滴地从第二号帐转到第一号帐上，我们就在第一号帐上提取。这就是破产的科伦坡计划的一笔总帐。
    还必须注意到：科伦坡计划中的一切各种方案都是不改变我们经济上的附属地位为原则的。它的各种方案都与改善运输和农业有关。没有一项允许发展我国的工业。国际银行调查团的报告甚至建议反对所有形式的工业发展，连大规模的农业计划也不赞成。这就是帝国主义要使殖民地国家附属于别的国家的政策的一部分。当人们指出这一点的时候，我们的政府就申述获得生产设备的困难。其实，唯有今天忙于军火生产因而不能制造生产设备的那些国家的集团才有这种困难。但是我们知道最近在仰光举行的亚洲暨远东经济委员会会议上，苏联代表就提议过供给我们机器和我们所需要的其他物品。但是由于美国的压力和它对半个世界的贸易实行禁运，我们的政府并没有接受这个建议。
    很明显，只有各国在互利的关系上进行经济和贸易的充分和自由的交流，才不仅能够减轻战争的危险，而且能使得比较落后的国家得到开发。我们一定要代表我们的和平运动，尽我们所能去迫使我国政府，进一步不顾美国所强制实行的贸易禁运，而和所有的国家建立贸易和友好的关系。我们很高兴，我们能够从锡兰派遣一个代表团参加在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议，结果增进了锡兰与西欧国家、苏联和中国之间的贸易。
    最后，我热烈支持在以前的报告中所包含的各项建议。
