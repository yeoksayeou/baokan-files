    The Fifth Five-Year Plan for Soviet Development
    ——Editorial from the Soviet Pravda, August 22nd
    The Soviet people are welcoming with great enthusiasm the decision of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to convene the 19th Congress (regular session) of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on October 5, 1952.

    The convocation of the congress of the great party of Lenin and Stalin—the inspirer and organizer of the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union—is an important historical event in the lives of all our people. The Soviet people, closely united around the Communist Party, united around Comrade Stalin, the genius leader and teacher of the working people, are marching towards the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) with new and outstanding victories.

    In his historic speech on February 9, 1946, Comrade Stalin outlined the plans of the Communist Party for the near and longer term. Responding to the call of the Party, our people launched a socialist competition with great creativity to restore and develop the national economy and completed the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The huge hydroelectric power stations and canals built on the Volga and Dnieper, on the Don and Amu Darya, are shining evidence of the increased power of the Soviet state and its peace-loving policy. The first of these great constructions—the Volga-Don Navigation Canal named after Lenin—has already been opened to navigation.

    The Soviet people are welcoming with exceptional joy the draft directives of the 19th Party Congress regarding the Fifth Five-Year Plan for Soviet Development for 1951-1955. The Fifth Five-Year Plan sets out a new and powerful upsurge in the Soviet national economy and ensures a further significant increase in the material well-being and cultural level of the people. The plan stipulates that the level of industrial production will increase by approximately 70 percent during the five-year period, with an average annual increase in total industrial output of approximately 12 percent.

    The most important principle of socialist planned economy is the priority development and particularly high-speed growth of heavy industry, because heavy industry is the foundation for the continuous advancement of all sectors of the national economy. The draft directives regarding the Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulate that the output of means of production (Category A) will increase by 13 percent, while the output of consumer goods (Category B) will increase by 11 percent.

    The Fifth Five-Year Plan calls for a rapid increase in the production of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, coal and oil, electricity and machinery manufacturing products, chemical, forestry, construction and other industrial products, further improvements in transportation and communications, and a substantial expansion of the production of food and industrial goods needed by residents. By 1955, the output of pig iron will increase by 76 percent compared to 1950, steel by 62 percent, rolled metal by 64 percent, coal by 43 percent, oil by 85 percent, and electricity by 80 percent.

    Machinery manufacturing is designated for rapid development as the foundation for new high-speed technological progress in all sectors of the Soviet national economy. During the five-year period, the output of machinery manufacturing and metal products industries will roughly double.

    The Fifth Five-Year Plan opens up prospects for large-scale construction work and the realization of technological progress in all industrial sectors. In order to further increase industrial production, state investment in industry from 1951 to 1955 will expand by approximately two times compared to 1946 to 1950. In addition to starting to utilize new enterprises and departments, it is stipulated that existing enterprises should be reconstructed, new equipment added, production mechanized, production speed increased, and production processes improved, thereby expanding the production capacity of existing enterprises.

    In the new Five-Year Plan, great attention is paid to the further upsurge of agriculture. The main tasks in agriculture remain to increase the yield of all crops by further consolidating and developing the collective farms' public economy, improving the work of state farms and machine tractor stations based on the application of modern machinery and agricultural technology in agriculture, further increasing the public livestock, while substantially increasing the productivity of its products, and increasing the total output and commodity output of agriculture and animal husbandry. Collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms must also be equipped with a large amount of the best modern machinery, including electric tractors, and must obtain everything necessary to continuously improve the level of agricultural production and successfully complete the plan to transform nature.

    The draft directives of the 19th Party Congress regarding the Fifth Five-Year Plan brilliantly demonstrate Stalin's concern for the continuous improvement of the well-being and cultural level of the Soviet people, the working people. The production of consumer goods will be greatly expanded. The increase in state-owned and cooperative retail trade will be nearly 70 percent. The increase in national income is stipulated to be no less than 60 percent, while further expanding the number of employees in the national economy, increasing their real wages, and increasing the income of farmers. Housing construction and the improvement of residential areas will also be carried out on a wider scale.

    In the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the network of scientific and cultural institutions, health care and educational institutions will be greatly expanded. Great attention is paid to the training of skilled personnel for various sectors of the national economy and culture, to the communist education of the working people, and to raising their cultural and technical level.

    The new Five-Year Plan presents all Soviet people with a concrete program for the daily struggle to consolidate the power of our motherland. The completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan will be a major step forward in the development from socialism to communism.

    The draft directives of the Five-Year Plan point out that in order to complete the tasks of this Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to "mobilize the internal resources of the national economy to continue accumulating socialist funds, while strictly observing state discipline, and all enterprises must complete their assigned production plans."

    On the basis of adopting advanced technology, improving labor organization, and raising the cultural and technical level of workers, it is necessary to increase labor productivity in industry by approximately 50 percent during the five-year period, in construction by 55 percent, and in agriculture by 40 percent.

    The arduous and laborious work in industry and construction is planned to be basically mechanized. At the same time, the production cost of industrial products should be reduced by approximately 25 percent during the five-year period, and the cost of construction projects should be reduced by no less than 20 percent.

    "The tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan," the draft directives say, "place significant demands on Party and Soviet organizations at all levels, economic organizations, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels, obliging them to mobilize the broad masses of working people to strive to complete and overfulfill the new Five-Year Plan, and to conduct broad criticism of the shortcomings in the work of our organizations in order to eliminate these shortcomings as quickly as possible." The efforts of inventors and rationalization proposers, innovators in industrial and collective agricultural production, advanced workers in transportation and other sectors of the national economy to increase production, improve labor productivity, and reduce production costs must be given the greatest support.

    The 1951-1955 Soviet Development Five-Year Plan has great international significance. The draft directives of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) regarding the Five-Year Plan say, "This (Fifth) Five-Year Plan once again shows the world the great vitality of socialism, and the fundamental superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system. This Five-Year Plan is a plan for peaceful economic and cultural construction. This plan will further consolidate and expand economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and develop our economic relations with all countries willing to develop trade based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit."

    The people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, united around the Communist Party, are greeting the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) with new achievements in creative labor and a powerful upsurge in the nationwide socialist competition. The great power of the socialist competition, the united desire of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals to defend the cause of peace, and the unwavering determination of the working people to build a communist society should all be turned to completing and overfulfilling the new Five-Year Plan.

    Under the long-tested leadership of the great Party of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people are successfully implementing the Fifth Five-Year Plan, and they will victoriously take a new and giant step towards communism.

    第五个苏联发展五年计划
    ——苏联真理报八月二十二日社论
    苏联人民以巨大的热忱来迎接联共（布）中央委员会关于在一九五二年十月五日召开联共（布）第十九次代表大会（例会）的决议。
    伟大的列宁、斯大林的党——社会主义在苏联胜利的鼓舞者和组织者——的代表大会的召开，是我们全体人民生活中的重要的历史性事件。苏联人民紧密地团结在共产党的周围，团结在劳动人民的天才领袖和导师斯大林同志的周围，以新的卓越的胜利走向联共（布）第十九次代表大会。
    斯大林同志在一九四六年二月九日的历史性讲演中，就描绘出共产党在最近和较长时期的计划。我国人民按照党的号召以巨大的创造力展开了争取恢复和发展国民经济的社会主义竞赛，提前完成了战后五年计划。在伏尔加河和第聂泊河，在顿河和阿姆河所建筑的巨大水电站和运河，是苏维埃国家增长了的威力和它的爱好和平的政策的光辉证据。这些伟大建筑中的第一个——以列宁为名的伏尔加河—顿河通航运河，已经开航了。
    苏联人民以异常愉快的心情，来迎接党的第十九次代表大会关于一九五一年——一九五五年的第五个苏联发展五年计划的指示草案。第五个五年计划确定着苏联国民经济的新的有力高涨并保证人民的物质幸福和文化水平的进一步的显著增长。计划规定在五年期间工业生产水平提高约百分之七十，工业总产量每年平均约增加百分之十二。
    社会主义计划经济的最重要原则，是重工业的首先发展和特殊高速度的增长，因为重工业是国民经济各部门不断前进的基础。关于第五个五年计划的指示草案，规定生产资料（甲类）产量的增加率为百分之十三，消费资料（乙类）产量的增加率为百分之十一。
    在第五个五年计划中，指出高速增加黑金属和有色金属、煤和石油的生产，电力和机器制造品、化学、林业、建筑和其他工业的产品，进一步提高运输和交通，并大量扩充居民所需的粮食和工业品的生产。到一九五五年，铣铁的产量比一九五○年增加百分之七十六，钢增加百分之六十二，压延金属增加百分之六十四，煤增加百分之四十三，石油增加百分之八十五，电力增加百分之八十。
    机器制造业被规定要迅速发展，以为苏联国民经济各部门新的高速度的技术进步的基础。在五年期间，机器制造业和金属品工业的产量约增为二倍。
    第五个五年计划为更大规模地展开建筑工作和实现工业各部门的技术进步开辟了远景。为了进一步提高工业生产，国家在一九五一年至一九五五年的工业总投资，较一九四六年至一九五○年将扩大约为二倍。除了开始利用新的企业和部门以外，规定把现有企业加以改建、添设新的装备、生产机械化、增加生产速度并改善生产过程，从而扩大现有企业的生产能力。
    在新的五年计划中，对农业的进一步高涨给予了巨大的注意。在农业方面的主要任务，仍是通过进一步巩固和发展集体农场的公有经济、在农业中应用现代机器和农业技术的基础上改进国家农场和机器拖拉机站的工作，以提高一切农作物的收获量，进一步增加公有的牲畜，同时大量提高其产物生产率，并增加农业与牲畜饲养业的总产量与商品的产量。集体农场、机器拖拉机站和国家农场又要大量装备最好的现代机器，其中包括电气拖拉机，并要获得为了不断提高农业生产水平、成功地完成改造自然的计划的一切必需品。
    在第十九次党代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示草案中，光辉地表现出斯大林对苏联人、对劳动人民的幸福和文化水平的不断提高的关怀。消费品的生产将大加扩大。国营和合作社零售贸易增加将近百分之七十。国民收入的增加规定不少于百分之六十，同时进一步扩大国民经济中的职工的数量，提高他们的实际工资和农民的收入。住宅建筑以及住宅区的完善设备也要获得更加广泛的规模。
    在第五个五年计划中，科学和文化机关网、保健和教育机关网都将异常扩大。对于培养国民经济和文化各部门的熟练人员、对于劳动人民的共产主义教育和提高他们的文化技术水平，都寄予了巨大的注意。
    新的五年计划给全体苏联人民提出为巩固我们祖国的威力的日常斗争的具体纲领。第五个五年计划的完成，将是由社会主义向共产主义发展前进的一大步。
    在五年计划的指示草案中指出，为了完成这个五年计划的任务，必须“动员国民经济的内在资源，以继续积累社会主义资金，同时必须严格遵守国家纪律，各企业必须完成其分内的生产计划”。
    在采用先进技术、改善劳动组织和提高劳动者的文化技术水平的基础上，必须使工业方面的劳动生产率在五年期间提高约百分之五十，建筑业提高百分之五十五，农业提高百分之四十。
    工业和建筑业中的繁重工作和费力操作，预定要基本上完成机械化。同时在五年期间要降低工业品的生产成本约百分之二十五，建筑工程成本不少于百分之二十。
    “五年计划所规定的任务，——指示草案说——向党和苏维埃各级组织、经济组织、工会和共产主义青年团各级组织提出了重大的要求，责成它们动员广大的劳动人民群众来为完成和超额完成新五年计划而努力，对我们组织中的工作的缺点展开广泛的批评，以便尽快地消灭这些缺点。”对于发明者和合理化建议者、工业和集体农业生产的革新者、运输和国民经济其他部门的先进工作者的增加产量、提高劳动生产率和减低生产成本的努力，必须予以最大的支持。
    一九五一年——一九五五年苏联发展五年计划具有重大的国际意义。联共（布）第十九次代表大会关于五年计划的指示草案中说，“这一个（第五个）五年计划又一次向全世界表明了社会主义的伟大的活力，表明了社会主义经济制度较之资本主义经济制度具有根本的优越性。这个五年计划是和平的经济和文化建设的计划。这个计划将进一步巩固和扩大苏联与人民民主国家之间的经济合作，发展我们和所有愿意根据平等互利的原则发展贸易的各国之间的经济关系。”
    团结在共产党周围的苏联各族人民，以新的创造性劳动的成就，以全民社会主义竞赛的有力高涨来迎接联共（布）第十九次代表大会。社会主义竞赛的伟大力量，工人、集体农民和知识分子保卫和平事业的一致愿望，劳动人民建设共产主义社会的不可动摇的决心，都应当转向完成和超额完成新的五年计划。
    在伟大的列宁—斯大林党的久经考验的领导之下，苏联人民成功地执行着第五个五年计划，他们将向共产主义胜利地迈进新的巨大的一步。
