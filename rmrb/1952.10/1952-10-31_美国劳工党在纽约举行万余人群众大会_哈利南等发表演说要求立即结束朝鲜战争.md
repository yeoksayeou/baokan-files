Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 30th: TASS, New York: The American Labor Party held a mass rally in Madison Square Garden on October 27th, attended by over 15,000 people. Progressive Party presidential candidate Hallinan, vice-presidential candidate Mrs. Bass, and other speakers at the meeting demanded an "immediate end to the Korean War," which was repeatedly met with applause from the crowd.

In addition to Hallinan and Mrs. Bass, the speakers included Robertson, American Labor Party Chairman Marcantonio, black historian and peace activist Du Bois, American Labor Party Senate candidate Lamont, American Labor Party Congressional candidate, novelist Fast, and other American Labor Party local council candidates and black female trade union worker Morris.

Hallinan severely criticized the American war in Korea as an imperialist war, part of the delusion of American big capitalists attempting to dominate the world.

Mrs. Bass said: During my campaign travels across the United States, "everywhere I saw the American people worried about the Korean War, employment problems, and heavy taxes. They hope for a better and more secure life, a life of freedom and equality." Mrs. Bass pointed out: Republican and Democratic candidates do not seriously discuss these issues, nor do they express any intention to end the Korean War. On the contrary, "they are arguing about who is more anti-communist."

Mrs. Bass condemned Eisenhower's proposed "racial supremacist solution of 'Asians fighting Asians.'" Mrs. Bass said: "Eisenhower is not suggesting ending the war, but merely expanding it, turning the colored people of Asia into mercenaries willing to sacrifice their lives at any time for the prosperity of the Morgan family and the profits of Standard Oil."

    美国劳工党在纽约举行万余人群众大会
    哈利南等发表演说要求立即结束朝鲜战争
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：美国劳工党于十月二十七日在麦迪逊广场花园举行群众大会，到会的有一万五千多人。进步党总统候选人哈利南、副总统候选人巴斯夫人及其他发言者在会上要求“立即停止朝鲜战争”，到会群众一再报以掌声。
    除哈利南与巴斯夫人外，发言者还有罗伯逊、美国劳工党主席马肯托尼奥、黑人历史学家与和平战士杜波依斯、美国劳工党参议员候选人拉蒙特、美国劳工党国会议员候选人、小说家法斯特及其他美国劳工党地方议员候选人与黑人女工会工作者摩里斯。
    哈利南严厉抨击美国在朝鲜的战争是帝国主义者的战争，是美国大资本家企图统治世界的迷梦的一部分。
    巴斯夫人说：我在全美国进行竞选旅行时，“到处看到美国人民因朝鲜战争、职业问题与沉重的赋税而忧心忡忡。他们希望有较好的和较有保障的生活，有自由与平等的生活。”巴斯夫人指出：共和党与民主党的候选人并不认真地讨论这些问题，也不表示要结束朝鲜战争，相反地，“却在争论谁更反共。”
    巴斯夫人谴责艾森豪威尔提出的“‘以亚洲人制亚洲人’的种族优越主义的解决办法”。巴斯夫人说：“艾森豪威尔并不建议结束战争，只是建议扩大战争，把亚洲的有色人民变成愿意随时为摩根家族的繁荣与美孚油公司的利润而牺牲生命的雇佣军。”
