Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 29th: According to TASS, U.S. Progressive Party presidential candidate Halinan stated in a Columbia Broadcasting System speech on October 25th that Eisenhower and Stevenson did not dare to propose ending the meaningless Korean War, because doing so would harm the profits of those who rule the Republican and Democratic parties.

Halinan pointed out that only the issue of prisoner repatriation was now obstructing the Korean armistice. He questioned Eisenhower and Stevenson on this point: "Why do they insist on continuing the war and refuse to explain what we are fighting for? Why do American negotiators repeatedly seek excuses to avoid an armistice agreement that could have been reached a year ago?"

Halinan then explained to the American people: "War means profits for the big merchants who control these two old parties. They dare not face days without war, dare not face days without the excuse of a huge arms industry to maintain their profits. When the armistice negotiations were first announced, Wall Street was filled with 'peace fears.' The stock market plummeted and fell into extreme instability. Those who control the two old parties do not want peace, because they put profits first and the people last.

"They have earned an extra $20 billion in profits in the two years of the Korean War. This profit comes from our pockets—from the high prices you pay—the highest prices in our history. In addition, the government has given them factories worth $20 billion—money from you—money from the high taxes you pay, which account for more than 15 cents of your hourly wage.

"When the Republicans and Democrats began their arms program, they shamelessly talked about 'equal sacrifice.' In fact, they voted in Congress to freeze wages but relaxed profits."

Talking about the recent dispute between coal miners and mine owners over wage increases, Halinan said, "Have we heard General Eisenhower or Governor Stevenson say a word about this trick to deceive the miners? They don't say a word about ending the Korean War either. They have not said a word about restricting big business from making huge profits from the death and destruction of the Korean War."

Halinan continued: "Tax rates have tripled. Worse is yet to come. This week the newspaper announced that the Pentagon is planning another $400 billion arms program, which means you will pay more taxes. That also means more war."

Halinan finally asked voters to vote for the Progressive Party—to vote for peace.

    哈利南斥民主共和两党害怕停止朝鲜战争
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：十月二十五日，美国进步党总统候选人哈利南在哥伦比亚广播公司发表演说，指出艾森豪威尔与史蒂文森都不敢提出终止那无意义的朝鲜战争，因为那样便会损害那些统治共和党与民主党的人们的利润。
    哈利南指出现在只剩下一个遣俘的问题阻碍着朝鲜停战，他就此责问艾森豪威尔与史蒂文森：“为什么他们坚持一定要继续战争而不肯说明我们为何而战？为什么美国的谈判代表一再寻找藉口来避免一年前就可达成的停战协定呢？”
    哈利南接着向美国人民解释说：“战争意味着主持这两个老政党的大商人的利润。他们不敢面对着没有战争的日子、不敢面对着没有作为维持他们利润的巨大军火工业的藉口的日子。当最初宣布举行停战谈判时，华尔街就弥漫着‘和平恐惧’。证券市场暴跌并陷入极不稳定的状态。控制那两个老政党的人不要和平，因为他们把利润放在第一，把人民放在最末。
    “他们在二年朝鲜战争中赚了额外利润二百亿美元。这项利润来自我们的口袋——来自你们所付的高昂的物价——我们历史上最高的物价。此外，政府又给他们价值二百亿美元的工厂——是你们出的钱——是你们付高额的税所出的钱，这种税占你们每小时工资一角五分以上。
    “当共和党与民主党人开始他们的军备计划时，他们大言不惭地空谈什么‘牺牲均等’的话。事实上，他们在国会里投票冻结工资，但是放松利润。”
    谈到最近煤矿工人与矿主之间对增加工资问题的争执时，哈利南说：“我们有没有听到艾森豪威尔将军或史蒂文森州长对于这个欺骗矿工的手段说过
    一句话呢？他们对终止朝鲜战争一事也不说一句话。他们对于限制大企业从朝鲜战争的死亡与破坏中搜刮巨大利润一事也没有说过一句话。”
    哈利南接着说：“税率增加了三倍。更糟的事情还在后头。本星期报纸已宣布五角大楼正在计划另
    一个四百亿元的军备计划，那就意味着你们要付更多的税。那也意味着更多的战争。”
    哈利南最后要求选民投进步党的票——为和平而投票。
