Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station, with the assistance of the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau, conducted an accelerated literacy radio teaching experiment. It began on June 10th and ended on September 20th. After 180 hours of experimentation, the radio teaching achieved significant results.

Four experimental groups graduated a total of 86 students, including 13 workers and shop assistants, and 73 neighborhood women. The students' average literacy level increased from 300 characters to over 1,500 characters (41 of whom knew over 2,000 characters). They were generally able to read popular publications and newspapers.

The four listening and learning groups were organized with the assistance of relevant departments, mixed by region, without regard to class background or educational level. There was also a group of students in the radio station's broadcasting room. The average broadcast teaching time was one hour per day, with one hour of collective review (except Sundays). The tutoring work during the collective review was undertaken by the group's tutoring instructors. The listening and learning locations were in mass literacy spare-time schools, neighborhood mass offices, and students' homes.

In the first teaching stage, the broadcast teaching time (including collective review) was six hours for phonetic symbols and eighteen hours for Pinyin, totaling twenty-four hours. In the second teaching stage, intensive study of 2077 new characters, including review, testing, and overall review, took a total of seventy hours. The textbook used in the first and second teaching stages was a phonetic single-character textbook. The third teaching stage, reading, writing, and composition, and overall testing took a total of eighty-six hours. The reading textbook was the third and fourth volumes of the elementary class literacy textbook, totaling fifty-six lessons, approximately 15,000 characters.

How to Achieve Ideological Consistency Between Teachers and Students

Although radio teaching does not involve face-to-face interaction, it can still achieve ideological consistency between teachers and students. This is one of the main reasons for the success of radio teaching. To ensure a high degree of concentration between teachers and students, the radio station first emphasized the political mobilization work that ran through the entire teaching process. Because political mobilization is the primary task of conducting propaganda and education to the broad masses through radio, and inspiring their learning enthusiasm. In addition, timely understanding and grasping of students' ideological activities in learning is a prerequisite for achieving ideological consistency between both parties in radio teaching. The radio station relied on the reports of tutoring instructors in each group, and also went deep into the groups to understand the specific situation at any time (if large-scale listening and learning is carried out in the future, key groups can be selected for in-depth understanding), analyzed and studied the students' ideological situation, and timely raised universal issues in the broadcast to encourage their learning enthusiasm and eliminate their ideological obstacles. For example, many illiterate people who had not participated in learning before were not mentally focused at the beginning and often thought about other things. Some people were unwilling to participate in mutual aid group learning and preferred to study alone, and some people were unwilling to learn phonetic symbols. After these ideological activities were pointed out, the students felt strange and said: "The teachers in the radio station can't see us but they know what's in our minds, just like being right in front of us." Special ideological problems arising among students in the group were the responsibility of the tutoring instructors to solve.

The entire ideological mobilization work revolves around one goal: that teachers teach well and students learn well. When students truly see their achievements and become interested in learning, their minds will naturally be focused. In this experiment, the radio station's editors and announcers served as teachers. Many students reflected that the pronunciation was correct and the explanations were clear, and they hoped to continue learning after graduation. It would be even better if the best teachers were selected for teaching.

Correctly Grasp the Progress of Radio Teaching and Solve Problems in Learning in a Timely Manner

The students' ability to accept knowledge is extremely related to their original literacy level and the amount of time they spend reviewing outside of class. Therefore, the teaching progress should take care of the majority of students with lower abilities and should not be too fast. When intensively studying difficult and complex characters, the amount of instruction should be reduced. The radio station regularly learned about the situation from the reports of the group tutoring instructors and also conducted on-the-spot understanding in the groups. When problems were discovered in teaching, such as students not being able to accurately pronounce phonetic symbols, not being able to put Pinyin together, and not paying attention to discarding "crutches" while learning new characters intensively, they were raised in the broadcast teaching to help students solve them. As for temporary learning problems or individual problems, such as a student not being able to pronounce a certain character well or not hearing clearly during broadcast teaching, the group tutoring teacher would help the student solve it during review. When encountering uneven development in learning, the radio station could give appropriate consideration to the teaching progress. The tutoring teachers conducted focused tutoring in the group for students who were lagging behind; mobilized mutual teaching and learning among students, conducted regular tests, conducted in-depth key inspections, and provided assistance. If broadcast teaching and group tutoring are closely integrated, lagging students can basically be prevented from falling behind.

The Role and Selection of Tutoring Instructors

In the literacy movement, radio can mobilize thousands of people to learn, and the Qi Jianhua accelerated literacy method can be used to teach thousands of people. We can say that no school or literacy class can directly undertake such large-scale teaching work. But to complete this work well, close cooperation with tutoring work must be obtained.

Around the broadcast teaching, the tutoring instructors of each group must master the learning situation and ideological situation of all the students in the group, conduct necessary learning guidance, and directly help students abide by learning systems such as attendance and examinations, and lead students to conduct mutual learning. Temporary problems or special problems in the group need to be solved by the tutoring instructors. The tutoring instructors of the four experimental groups led by the radio station all gave full play to their enthusiasm in this regard and generally completed their tasks.

Selecting the best teachers to conduct accelerated literacy teaching through radio, and having tutoring instructors in each group to undertake learning tutoring work, not only solves the learning problems of thousands of people, but also solves the problem of a shortage of teachers. Tutoring instructors can conduct tutoring based on the broadcast teaching and solve teaching difficulties. The tutoring instructors of the four groups in this radio station experiment were either graduates of accelerated literacy classes or street activists with a higher primary school education or above who had also learned the accelerated literacy method. They generally had some preliminary understanding of the accelerated literacy method and were able to be actively responsible. They carried out learning tutoring work in the group and were closely integrated with the broadcast teaching.

To enable the tutoring instructors to give full play to their enthusiasm, they must be given strong leadership and assistance, and regular meetings should be held at the radio station to study and arrange work. Radio station staff should regularly go deep into the groups to provide necessary assistance. For example, not long after the start of listening and learning, one tutoring instructor was afraid that she would not be able to do the job well because she was undertaking this work for the first time and her confidence was not high. However, through the strong help of the leadership during the tutoring process, her work confidence gradually increased, and she further gave full play to her enthusiasm. Finally, all the students in the group achieved good results at graduation.

How to Complete Reading, Writing, and Composition Teaching

Many people doubt the radio accelerated literacy teaching, especially the effectiveness of the third teaching stage. They believe that writing and composition teaching cannot be carried out through radio at all. But our experience has shattered this doubt.

(1) Reading: According to the characteristics of broadcasting, the radio station selects texts and sentences with strong political content or difficult to explain from the textbook every day, and makes model readings, lead readings, and simple explanations in the broadcast, and explains the things to be paid attention to when reading. Then, it designates students to conduct reading during group mutual aid learning (an average of five or six lessons per day). After the broadcast is over, the tutoring instructor immediately guides the students according to the assigned homework during group mutual aid learning. The first reading of all the texts took a total of fourteen hours. Then, it immediately turned to teaching focused on writing.

(2) Writing: According to the experience of accelerated literacy and writing teaching in the Central South Military Region (published on page 3 of the People's Daily on June 25), in accordance with the characteristics of Chinese characters, disperse the difficulties, and teach from easy to difficult. First, the eight basic strokes of Chinese characters (dot, horizontal...), the five principles of stroke order and example characters, common character radicals and character heads, and common radicals are printed into a handout and distributed to students. Then, they are explained in the broadcast in the order, such as explaining the eight basic strokes of the character, that is, explaining the writing of the dot "、", that is, just take the pen and make a point on the paper; the horizontal stroke "一", start from the lower left, pull it to the right, stop at the end, and lift the pen. While explaining, students are asked to take a pen and describe it on the handout. After the eight basic strokes are broadcast, they are designated to practice writing during review, and they must practice until they can write them down from memory. When teaching stroke order, students are asked to look at the example characters. Teaching character heads and radicals is the same as teaching the basic strokes of writing. It is carried out in conjunction with reading and is taught in three times (three days). After the students initially understand the writing method, they are designated to copy the phonetic single-character textbook and a text in the group under the guidance of the tutor. Including repeated characters, about 4,000 characters were copied. Including broadcasting, it took a total of thirty-four hours.

(3) Composition: From teaching simple application notes and letters to teaching writing, short essays. Composition teaching is carried out in conjunction with relevant texts from easy to difficult. For example, to teach how to write a note, first lead the reading of the "Note" text in the broadcast, and explain the things to be paid attention to when writing a note. Then, tell the students to write a simple note explaining something each during group mutual aid learning (the specific content is first explained by the teacher in the broadcast). When writing, first explain the content related to the students such as learning, daily life, etc., in the broadcast, and then ask the students to write it themselves. Or first explain the content, such as why couldn't you go to school before liberation? Why can you go to school now? Ask the students to write it after chatting in the group. Or designate students to use the method of "You say I write, I say you write, one person says everyone writes" during review. Finally, it enters into writing short essays on assigned topics.

The teaching in the third teaching stage is carried out in accordance with the above methods, and then combined with broadcast mobilization and group tutoring and student mutual learning. Correcting students' stroke order errors and typos, as well as dictation, writing, correcting homework, and encouraging and inspiring students to read and write, are carried out under the guidance of the tutoring instructors in the group. Group tutoring and mutual learning are closely integrated with the teaching progress and content every day. In eighty-six hours (including overall review and testing), the third teaching stage was completed. (Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station Editorial Department)

    天津人民广播电台的速成识字广播教学
    天津人民广播电台在天津市教育局协助下，通过广播进行了速成识字教学实验，自六月十日开始，至九月二十日结束，经过一八○小时实验，广播教学获得显著成绩。
    四个实验组共毕业学员八十六名，其中有职工，店员十三名，街道妇女七十三名。学员由原来平均识三百字提高到一千五百字以上（其中四十一名识二千字以上）。一般能阅读通俗读物及报纸。
    四个收听学习组是经有关部门协助按地区不分成份和文化水平混合组织起来的。在电台播音室内另有一组学员。每天平均广播教学一小时，集体复习一小时（星期日除外），集体复习时的辅导工作由组内辅导教员担任，收听学习地点在群众识字业余学校、街道群众办公室及学员家中。
    第一教学阶段广播教学时间（集体复习包括在内），注音符号六小时，拼音十八小时，共二十四小时。第二教学阶段突击生字二○七七个，连复习、测验、总复习，共七十小时。第一、二教学阶段使用的课本是注音单字课本。第三教学阶段阅读、写字、写话及总测验共用八十六小时，阅读课本为初级班识字课本第三、四册，共五十六课，约一五○○○字。
    如何使教学双方思想达到一致
    广播教学虽当面不见人，但同样能使教学双方思想达到一致。这是广播教学能获得成功的主要原因之一。为使教学双方思想高度集中，电台首先重视了贯穿全部教学过程的政治鼓动工作。因为政治鼓动是通过广播向广大群众进行宣传教育，鼓舞他们学习情绪的首要工作。此外，及时了解掌握学员在学习中的思想活动，是使广播教学双方思想达到一致的先决条件，电台一方面依靠各组辅导教员的汇报，一方面随时深入组内具体进行了解（如将来大规模开展收听学习，可选择重点组深入了解），对学员的思想情况加以分析研究，并在广播中及时提出带普遍性的问题，以鼓励其学习积极性，消除他们的思想障碍。如许多没有参加过学习的文盲，开始时精神不集中，常想着别的事，也有人不愿参加互助组学习，喜欢单独学，还有人不愿学注音符号，这些思想活动经指出后，学员感到奇怪，说：“电台里的老师看不见咱们也知道咱们心里的事，像在跟前一样。”组内学员中产生的特殊思想问题，则由辅导教员负责解决。
    整个思想动员工作都是围绕着这样一个目的：就是教员教得好，学员学得好。学员真正看到自己的成绩，对学习感到兴趣，思想当然就集中了。这次实验是由电台的编辑和播音员担任教员，许多学员们反映：念字正确，讲解清楚，希望毕业后再接着学。如果选择最好的教员担任教学那就更好了。
    正确掌握广播教学进度，及时解决学习中的问题
    学员的接受能力与其原来的识字程度和课外复习时间的多少有极大的关系。因此教学进度要照顾能力较低的大多数学员，不要求太快。突击到难讲、笔划多的字时，就减少讲授的份量。电台经常从组内辅导教员的汇报中掌握情况，同时到组内进行实地了解。教学中发现了问题，如学员念不准注音符号，拼音碰不到一块，突击生字不注意边学边丢“拐棍”，就在广播教学中提出，帮助学员解决。至于临时发生的学习问题或个别问题，如某个学员对某个字念不好或广播教学时没听清楚，即由组内辅导老师在复习时帮助学员解决。在学习中遇到发展不平衡的现象，电台可在教学进度上予以适当照顾，对学习较差的学员由辅导老师在组内进行重点辅导；在学员中发动包教包学，定期测验，深入重点检查，进行帮助。如果广播教学和组内辅导紧密结合起来，基本上可使落后学员不掉队。
    辅导教员的作用和选择
    在识字运动中，通过广播可以动员成千上万的群众进行学习，用祁建华速成识字法向成千上万的人进行教学。我们可以说，没有任何一个学校和识字班可以直接担负起这样规模广泛的教学工作。但要很好地完成这一工作，必须获得辅导工作的密切配合。
    围绕着广播教学，各组辅导教员必须掌握全组学员的学习情况和思想情况，进行必要的学习辅导，并且要直接帮助学员遵守考勤、考试等学习制度，领导学员进行互助学习。组内临时发生的问题或特殊问题，都需要由辅导教员来解决。电台领导的四个实验组的辅导教员都在这方面发挥了高度积极性，一般都完成了任务。
    选择最优秀的教员通过广播进行速成识字教学，各组内由辅导教员担任学习辅导工作，这样不但解决了成千上万人的学习问题，而且解决了师资缺乏的问题。辅导教员可以根据广播教学进行辅导，解决教学上的困难。这次电台进行实验的四个组的辅导教员，有的是速成识字班毕业的学员，也有的是具有高小以上文化水平又学了速成识字法的街道积极分子，一般对速成识字法有些初步体会，并能积极负责。他们在组内进行学习辅导工作，与广播教学紧密结合起来。
    要使辅导教员能充分发挥其积极性，必须予以有力的领导和帮助，定期在电台开碰头会研究工作，布置工作。电台工作人员经常要深入各组，予以必要的帮助。如开始收听学习后不久，有一个辅导教员因初次担任这一工作，怕自己不能胜任，信心不高，但在辅导学习过程中，经过领导方面的大力帮助，逐渐增强了工作信心，进一步发挥了高度积极性，最后使全组学员在毕业时获得了较好的成绩。
    如何完成阅读、写字和写话教学
    很多人怀疑广播速成识字教学，尤其不相信第三教学阶段的效果。他们以为通过广播根本无法进行写字和写话教学。可是我们的经验打破了这种怀疑。
    （一）阅读：根据广播特点，电台每天从课本中选择政治性较强或难讲的课文、词句，在广播中作范读、领读、简单讲解，并说明阅读时应注意的事项。然后指定学员在小组互助学习时，进行阅读（每天平均五、六课）。广播完了，学员在小组互助学习时，辅导教员即根据所指定的功课，对学员进行辅导。全部课文第一次阅读完了，共用时间十四小时。然后即转入以写字为主的教学。
    （二）写字：根据中南军区速成识字写字教学经验（发表在人民日报六月二十五日第三版），依照中国字的特点，分散难点，由易到难进行教学。先将中国字的八种基本笔划（点、横……）、笔顺的五个原则及举例字、常用的字旁字头、常用的偏旁，印成一张讲义分发给学员。然后即按其顺序在广播中进行讲解，如讲字的八种基本笔划，即说明点“、”的写法，就是拿笔在纸上一点就行了；横笔“一”，从左下笔，往右边一拉，到头一停，把笔提起来。一面讲解，一面叫学员拿笔在讲义上描写。八种基本笔划广播完了，即指定在复习时练习写，要练习到能默写下来。教笔顺时叫学员看着举例字。教写字头字旁、偏旁与教写字的基本笔划同。与阅读配合进行，一共分三次（三天）教完。学员初步懂了写法，然后即指定学员在小组中抄写注音单字课本和一部课文，由辅导员进行辅导。连同重复字约共抄写了四千字次。连广播在内共用时间三十四小时。
    （三）写话：由教写简单应用便条、信，到教写话、短文。写话教学是结合有关课文由易到难进行的。如要教写便条，即在广播中先领念“便条”课文，并说明写便条时应注意的事项。然后，告诉学员在小组互助学习时，每人写一个说明某一件事情的简单便条（具体内容先由教员在广播中说明）。写话时，也先在广播中就与学员有关的事情如学习、日常生活等，说明内容，然后叫学员自己写。或先说明内容，如解放前为什么上不了学？现在为什么能上学呢？叫学员在小组中经漫谈后再写。或指定学员在复习时采用“你说我写、我说你写、一人说大家写”的方式。最后进到出题目写短文。
    第三教学阶段的教学，除按照以上方式进行外，再结合广播鼓动和组内辅导以及学员互助学习进行。纠正学员笔顺错误和错别字以及听写，写话，批改作业，鼓励启发学员读写等工作，是在组内辅导教员的辅导下进行的。组内辅导和互助学习，每天都与教学进度和内容紧密结合起来进行。在八十六小时内（包括总复习及测验）第三教学阶段即全部完成了。　　　　　（天津人民广播电台编辑科）
