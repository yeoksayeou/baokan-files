He expressed deep gratitude for the kindness of the people of the motherland in sending慰问团 to the Korean front twice to express their regards, saying: Every encouragement from the people of the motherland has become a force for our Volunteer Army to strike at the enemy. The planes and artillery donated to us by the people of the motherland have played a tremendous role on the Korean front. With these weapons, our Volunteer Army has achieved greater and greater victories; we will continue to make these weapons play a greater role and achieve greater victories in the war against U.S. aggression.

He said: As long as the U.S. aggressors do not abandon their ambition to invade Korea, and the Korean issue is not resolved fairly and reasonably, the Chinese people will continue to strengthen their work to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea; whatever the front needs, we will supply; whatever the front hopes for, we will do. Finally, he wished the Volunteer Army to establish even greater meritorious service and strive for even greater victories for the security of the motherland, for the independence of Korea, and for the peace of Asia and the world.

    Representative of the cultural and educational circles, Director of the Anatomy Department of Peking Union Medical College, Zhang Yun, said: The victory of the Volunteer Army on the front has also greatly encouraged our educational circles.
