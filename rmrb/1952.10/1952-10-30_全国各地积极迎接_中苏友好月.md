Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in East China, Central South, North China, and Northwest China are currently actively carrying out various preparations for "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities.

    In order to strengthen leadership over the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, leadership organizations have been established in various regions. The East China region and Shanghai have established a preparatory committee composed of eighty-seven people, with Chen Yi, President of the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, serving as the chairman. The preparatory committee has established an office and seven divisions to carry out specific tasks. The preparatory committees in Fujian Province (including Fuzhou City) and Nanjing City have also been established, with Zhang Dingcheng, President of the Fujian Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and Ke Qingshi, President of the Nanjing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, serving as chairmen, respectively. The Central South region has established a "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" office, with Zhao Yimin and Li Xiannian, Vice Presidents of the Central South Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, serving as directors. In addition, Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in North China, as well as Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City in Northwest China, have also established organizations to prepare for "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities.

    According to the instructions of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, all regions have held special meetings for discussion and formulated work plans for "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." At the joint enlarged meeting of the council of the East China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Shanghai Branch, it was decided that during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, combined with China's current production increase and economization and democratic reform movements, the achievements of the Soviet Union's various constructions and advanced production experiences should be used to conduct widespread education on the prospects of socialism and communism among the masses, so that people from all walks of life can better learn from the Soviet Union and welcome China's upcoming large-scale economic construction; at the same time, in connection with the current situation of the world peace movement, education on internationalism and patriotism should be carried out to enable the broad masses to further recognize the great significance of the friendly unity between the Chinese and Soviet people in accelerating China's construction and defending the Far East and the cause of world peace. The Central South Sino-Soviet Friendship Association also held an enlarged meeting of executive officers to discuss propaganda guidelines and content.

    During "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," in addition to holding celebration meetings, lecture meetings, report meetings, symposiums, Soviet photo exhibitions, and Soviet color film exhibitions, various forms will be adopted to conduct in-depth propaganda activities among the masses of all strata. The Shaanxi Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has decided to organize lantern slide teams and propaganda teams, carrying lantern slides, records, pictures, radios, etc., to go deep into the countryside, and to uniformly organize propagandists, blackboard newspaper editors, newspaper reading group leaders, primary school teachers, folk artists, etc. in districts, towns, and villages to widely carry out propaganda through storytelling, rooftop broadcasting, blackboard newspapers, and other methods. Hebei and Shanxi provinces will invite members of the farmer delegation to the Soviet Union to give special reports to people from all walks of life. Literary and art workers in Nanjing City will use music, drama, dance, shadow plays, folk art forms, etc. to go to factories, mines, and rural areas in the suburbs to promote the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation to workers and farmers. The Central South Sino-Soviet Friendship Association film team and propaganda vehicle will go to the Dayao Mountains in Guangxi and the ethnic minority areas of western Hunan and northern Guangdong to screen Soviet films and lantern slides introducing the happy lives of the people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will organize six propaganda groups to go deep into the grasslands to conduct propaganda among the herdsmen.

    During "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will be further developed and consolidated in various regions. The Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has decided to combine propaganda activities to develop a large number of members and strengthen grassroots work. The Northwest Sino-Soviet Friendship Association plans to complete this year's membership development plan between November 7th and December 6th, and strive to establish all municipal and county branches and sub-branches in places where they have not yet been established.
