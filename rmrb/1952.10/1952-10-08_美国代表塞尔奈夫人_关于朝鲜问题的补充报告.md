After listening to the moving and powerful report by Mr. Han Xueye, head of the Korean delegation, the U.S. delegation feels it is necessary to express its views. The issue raised by Mr. Han Xueye regarding the immediate end to the cruel and senseless war in Korea is an extremely important issue. As he said, it is not only extremely important to the heroic Korean people and to peace in Asia and the world, but also equally important to the people of the United States.

Those of us who have come from the United States, participating in this great conference, understand that we, like many others, have opposed American intervention in Korea from the very beginning. We, like many others, have loudly protested the barbaric acts committed in the name of our people; we have also actively sought to stop this senseless, unjust, and irrational war.

But until we came here – until we saw the eyes of the Korean women – so full of pain and pride – until we shook the strong and powerful hands of the Korean men, we did not fully understand the full horror of this war.

That night, seeing the Indian women and their Korean sisters embrace on this platform, we began to understand – much more deeply than we could have before – what kind of crime these innocent people have encountered for more than two years, how many mothers have lost their children, how many children have become orphans, and how many homes have been wantonly destroyed.

We have seen here how the entire Asia regards this long-lasting war brought to it from afar with such resentment.

We are deeply moved that this conference has consistently distinguished between the U.S. government and the American people. Such a distinction gives us hope. It is in line with the fact that our own people fear war and are increasingly opposed to it. But we must also speak on this platform to millions of honest and good American people, to those Americans whose sons are on the Korean battlefield, to those Americans who have received telegrams from Washington announcing the deaths of their loved ones, to those Americans who are now receiving notices of the conscription of hundreds of thousands more young people. We say to them that we share a significant responsibility for these things done in our name, unless we stand up in time and join the struggle to stop this war.

How could people like us get involved in this war? In part, it is due to the lies in the mass media, disguised under the banner of freedom of the press. They deliberately keep the American people ignorant. For example, millions of people have no idea that American pilots have confessed to the crime of bacteriological warfare. Our radio and television networks are spreading rumors and propagating bestiality one after another, creating an atmosphere of war to deceive our people.

This war against the Korean people was initially described in the United States as a "police action." Our people were told that they would fight alongside all of their so-called free world allies for the noble cause of the United Nations. It was said that only by taking such steps could we maintain national security and save world peace. At that time, just two years ago in the summer, most of our people followed this line of argument. They followed it reluctantly, but they followed it nonetheless.

The Korean adventure has exposed all this nonsense, which our people had initially believed in and reluctantly supported. The real reason why our misguided leaders are so hysterical today, why they are frantically trying to intimidate our people, is that the Korean War has revealed certain facts that they do not want the world to know, and certainly do not want the American people to understand.

Our people have discovered that this is not just a short-term "police action" as they had thought. They have discovered that the Korean people, because they are fighting for a just cause, have been able to stop the American troops and drive them back. The Korean resistance symbolizes a new Asia.

As the American people saw the list of their dead in Korea growing longer day by day, their living standards declining, and taxes increasing, and as they began to calculate these costs, they also began to realize what state our country had been brought to by the policies of our leaders. The American people learned that the support of the United Nations was just a sham.

The magnificent feat of the Chinese People's Volunteers assisting their Korean friends and defending their own borders has further opened the eyes of millions of our people, making them recognize reality. They have seen the patience of the new China, and they have also seen its strength. They have seen that the people of Asian countries are no longer helpless against the most modern weapons.

Far from gaining peace and security by attacking the Korean people, more and more Americans are beginning to realize that if such a war continues, there is a great danger of causing a world war on a global scale. It is becoming increasingly clear that if we cannot defeat the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, then we – if a world war breaks out – are in danger of being defeated by the united peoples of all countries.

Our generals, unable to defeat the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the battlefield, had to insidiously, despicably, and filthily abuse modern science and launch bacteriological warfare. After seeing the exhibition of bacteriological warfare in Beijing and reading the report of the International Scientific Commission, we have no doubt about this fact. This is a preview of what the next war will be like. Bacteriological warfare proves that those who are constantly singing the praises of honesty, fairness, and kindness have unhesitatingly committed fraudulent acts and used the most terrible means of warfare.

As for the armistice negotiations and the issue of prisoners of war, the whole world has seen that our generals and diplomats accuse others of violating honorable agreements, while they themselves refuse to comply with the clearly stipulated treaty that all prisoners of war must be repatriated to their home countries. What is even worse is that these gentlemen claim that they cannot fulfill their own agreements because they must consider higher humanitarian requirements for prisoners of war, but it is these same gentlemen who are killing prisoners of war held behind barbed wire. On the one hand, these prisoners of war, though captured and bound, have not yielded and will never yield, because their patriotic enthusiasm cannot be destroyed by persecution. On the other hand, these prisoners of war, despite promises of safety and good treatment, and despite the U.S. government's solemn agreements guaranteeing their repatriation, have been mistreated and massacred in the prisoner of war camps on Jeju Island. This is what these desperate American thugs have done.

Throughout this long process of armistice negotiations, American planes equipped with gasoline bombs and missiles have systematically destroyed all the remaining cities and towns in Korea. The war-makers, unable to win on the battlefield and failing in their blackmail in the armistice negotiations, have completely exposed their true colors – but this desperate struggle of theirs is absolutely useless.

All of this, the people of our country have begun to understand. Many things are happening in our country that the world has not seen, but these things may indicate the growing aversion, fear, and bewilderment of an increasingly large segment of our population towards the Korean War and a Third World War – and a growing, increasingly conscious opposition.

Stopping the Korean War has become a major issue in the current election campaign. The Democratic and Republican parties have been attacking each other, blaming each other for the responsibility for this war. Both parties have been forced to promise to end the war, although both parties' presidential candidates have admitted that they do not know how to end it. What is happening in our country is, in fact, a profound criticism and re-examination of the fundamental assumptions of our destructive foreign policy.

Our people have expressed their fears and opposition in many different ways, sometimes not directly related to this war, sometimes dissatisfied with its situation without directly attacking its purpose.

In the past year, especially in the past six months, a series of resolutions have been made by trade unions and union leaders with various viewpoints. A year ago, John L. Lewis, president of the independent United Mine Workers, spoke to 45,000 workers at the Ford factory in Detroit and asked the question: "What will happen to us if, when we are ready to fight the Soviet Union, we find that we cannot do so?"

Mr. Lewis predicted a recession and an attack on the organized working class; he suggested that American workers raise $50 million for joint self-defense. A year later, the president of the Ford plant branch of the United Automobile Workers Union, which has a million members, said that American workers are already attacking the war. They demand the restoration of the peacetime economy.

Hugo Ernst of the American Federation of Labor and Frank Rosenblum, a well-known leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, have said similar things. Last year, there were more strikes than in any year in American history. This proves that American workers have not been deceived by false patriotic appeals.

Less than a year ago, the National Negro Labor Council was established at a grand conference in Cincinnati, Ohio, representing the growing number of black workers who play a decisive role in the American heavy industry sector; they demanded peace in Korea, and they have sparked the demand for an end to the war in the labor movement.

The incident of several hundred American pilots shows the true state of mind in the American army. These pilots were reserve officers who had participated in World War II, and they protested against re-enlistment. Their protest was so powerful that they had to be discharged. The wife of Davis, the top American pilot who was shot down in Korea, cried out against this useless war, reflecting her grief and also the feelings of hundreds of thousands of parents with children overseas.

An American veteran donated his Korean combat service pay to our representative for travel expenses to attend the conference. When donating the money to the conference, he said that everyone in his unit was horrified by the scorched earth policy of the U.S. military and the brutality of its implementation.

A moving thing happened in Little Rock, Arkansas. There was a contractor there whose son was a prisoner of war, now in North Korea. Whenever the government announced the list of prisoners of war, he would copy down the list of the parents of the prisoners of war, and then write letters to these parents, urging them to collect signatures demanding an end to the Korean War. In just a few weeks, this completely spontaneous and voluntary action, which had nothing to do with organized peace movements, collected nearly a million signatures. The tens of thousands of letters sent to newspapers across the country and the opinion polls express this deep-rooted feeling. These letters and opinion polls unanimously demand "an immediate ceasefire."

Finally, all the delegates of our American delegation agree with Mr. Han Xueye's proposal to reach an agreement on the issue of prisoner repatriation and immediately complete the armistice negotiations.

We believe that it is very clear that the Geneva Protocol, which our politicians signed but our Senate has never ratified, must be fully complied with.

We join everyone in demanding that bacteriological warfare and the bombing of peaceful Korean villages must stop. We call on the American people to heed the voices of the Asian people, demanding that those who instigated these acts be punished as war criminals.

We agree that, in the highest interest of our country, the U.S. military and the Chinese People's Volunteers should withdraw from Korea simultaneously after the signing of the armistice agreement. We firmly maintain that the Korean people must enjoy the right to decide their own destiny, a right that the people of every country should enjoy. In this spirit, we will do everything in our power to help awaken the American people after returning home. We will never stop. We will never be silent, and we must make sure that the people hear our voice. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 美国代表塞尔奈夫人  关于朝鲜问题的补充报告

    美国代表塞尔奈夫人
    关于朝鲜问题的补充报告
    美国代表团在听了朝鲜代表团团长韩雪野先生的动人和有力的报告之后，认为有表示意见的必要。韩雪野先生所提出的立即结束在朝鲜的残酷的无意义的战争的问题，是极端重要的问题。正如他所说的，不仅对英勇的朝鲜人民、对亚洲与世界的和平极端重要，而且对美国的人民也同样极端重要。
    参加这次伟大的会议的人们都了解，我们这些从美国来的代表们，也是和许多人一样自始就反对美国干涉朝鲜的。我们也是和许多人一样高声反对假借我国人民的名义干野蛮的勾当；我们也曾经积极地设法停止这个毫无意义、毫无正义、毫无理性的战争。
    但是直到我们来到这里——直到我们看见朝鲜妇女的眼睛——这样充满着痛苦和骄傲——直到我们与朝鲜男人的坚强有力的手相握之前，我们还没有充分理解这次战争的全部恐怖。
    那天晚上，看见印度妇女和她们的朝鲜姐妹们在这个讲台上拥抱，我们才开始懂得——比我们过去可能懂得的深刻得多——两年多以来，这些无辜的人民遭遇到怎样的一种罪行，多少母亲失去了孩子，多少孩子变成了孤儿，多少人家被恣意破坏。
    我们在这里已看到了整个亚洲怀着多么痛恨的心情来看待从老远的地方带给它的这么长久的战争。
    这次会议始终分清美国政府和美国人民，这深深地感动了我们。这样的分清界限使我们有了希望。这样做是符合我们本国人民惧怕战争和日益反对战争这一事实的。但是我们还必须在这个讲台上向千百万正直善良的美国人，向他们的儿子在朝鲜战场上的美国人，向接到华盛顿宣布他们亲人死亡的电报的美国人，向现在正接到又征募几十万青年的通知书的美国人说话，我们向他们说对于用我们的名义所作了的这些事情，我们也分担重大的责任，除非我们及时站起来，加入制止这个战争的斗争。
    像我们这样的人民怎么会卷入这个战争的呢？一部分是由于挂着新闻自由招牌的群众新闻报道中的谎话所致。他们有意使美国人民愚昧无知。举例来说，千百万人民根本不知道美国飞行员已供认了细菌战罪行。我们的无线电和电视网接二连三地散布谣言和宣传兽性，制造战争空气以蒙蔽我国人民。
    这个反对朝鲜人民的战争，当初在美国只说是个
    “警察行动”。我们的人民只听说，他们将和所有所谓自由世界的盟国为了联合国的崇高事业而并肩作战。据说只有采取这样步骤，我们才能保持国家的安全，挽救世界的和平。在那个时候，就是两年前的夏天，我们大多数的人民都跟着这个论调走。他们不情愿地跟着走，但是他们还是跟着走了。
    朝鲜的冒险行动戳穿了所有这些鬼话，我们的人民在起初都曾经轻信这些鬼话而勉强给以支持。我们的错误领导者今天之所以这样歇斯底里，他们之所以疯狂地企图恐吓我们人民，真正原因就是朝鲜战争揭露了一些事实，而这些事实是他们不愿意让世界知道的，当然更不愿意让美国人民了解。
    我们的人民发现这完全不是像他们所想的那样只是短期的“警察行动”，他们发现朝鲜人民因为是在为一个正义的事业斗争着，所以能够阻止美国的军队，并且把他们打回去。朝鲜的抵抗象征着一个新的亚洲。
    当美国人民看到他们在朝鲜死亡者的名单一天比一天长，他们的生活水准不断下降，捐税越来越重，当他们开始计算这些代价时，他们也就开始认识到我们的国家被我们领导者的政策弄到什么地步。美国人民知道了：联合国的支持只是一个骗局。
    中国人民志愿军援助他们的朝鲜朋友、保卫自己边疆的壮举，又打开了我们数百万人民的眼睛，认清了现实。他们看到了新中国的忍耐，也看到了它的力量。他们看到了亚洲各国人民对于最现代化的武器不再是束手无策了。
    这样对朝鲜人民进攻，不但没有获得和平与安全，越来越多的美国人民开始认识，像这样的一个战争如果继续下去，很有造成一次全世界规模的大战的危险。事实愈来愈明显：如果不能打败朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军，那么我们——如果世界大战打起的话——有被各国人民联合起来打败的危险。
    我们的将军们无法在战场上打败朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军，只好阴险地卑鄙地龌龊地滥用现代的科学，发动了细菌战。我们在北京看过细菌战的展览和读过国际科学委员会的报告以后，丝毫都不怀疑这个事实，这是一个预演，说明下一次大战是怎么回事。细菌战证明了，那些口口声声高唱诚实、公道和善良的家伙们，都毫不犹豫地作出了欺诈的行为，利用了最可怕的战争手段。
    至于停战谈判和战俘问题，全世界都看到，我们的将军和外交官们控诉人家违反了尊严的协定，然而他们自己却拒绝遵守明文规定所有战俘必须遣回本国的条约。更加恶劣的是，这些先生们声言他们对战俘要顾到更高的人道主义要求，因而不能履行他们自己的协定，但正是这些先生们在杀害被囚禁在铁丝网里面的战俘。一方面，这些战俘虽然被俘虏而且被捆绑起来，他们并没有屈服而且绝不会屈服，因为他们的爱国热忱是不能为迫害所摧残的。另一方面，这些战俘们尽管得到了保障安全和得到良好待遇的允诺，并且美国政府也签订了庄严的协定，保证将他们遣返回国，但正是这些战俘在济州岛的俘虏营中受到了虐待和屠杀。这就是这些绝望的美国暴徒们所干的事情。
    在这一漫长的停战谈判过程中，美国装备有汽油弹和飞弹的飞机，有计划地破坏和毁灭在朝鲜还存在着的所有城市和乡镇。战争制造者们，在战场上不能取胜，在停战谈判中讹诈失败，于是完全暴露出他们的真面目——可是，他们这种绝望的挣扎，也是绝对无济于事的。
    所有这一切，我们国家的人民已经开始懂得。许多事情正在我们的国家里发生，全世界并没有看见这些事情，但这些事情也许表示我国越来越广大的人民对于朝鲜战争和第三次世界大战的厌恶、恐惧和惶惑——还有不断增长着的，越来越觉悟的反对。
    停止朝鲜战争已经成为当前选举运动中的一个主要问题了。民主、共和两大政党已经在互相攻击，指责对这个战争所应负的责任。两党都被迫保证要结束战争，虽然两党的总统候选人都曾承认，他们并不知道如何来结束它。在我国正在发生的事情，实际上是对毁灭性的外交政策的基本前提，作深刻的批评和重新审查。
    我国人民已经用许多不同的方式，表示了他们的恐惧和反对；有时并不与这个战争有直接关系，有时不正面攻击它的目的而不满意它的情况。
    过去的一年，特别是在过去的六个月，各种不同观点的工会和工会领袖们作出了一连串的决议。一年以前，独立的矿工联合会主席约翰·路易斯曾对底特律福特工厂的四万五千名工人讲话，并问了这样一个问题：“如果当我们已经准备好对苏联作战，而又发觉我们不能够这样做时，那我们会怎么样呢？”
    路易斯先生预测会有不景气和对有组织的工人阶级的进攻；他建议美国工人募集五千万美元作联合自卫之用。一年后，拥有百万会员的联合汽车工人
    工会的福特厂分会主席说，美国工人，已经在抨击战争。他们要求恢复和平时期的经济。
    美国劳工联合会的雨果·恩斯特和著名的产业工会联合会领袖弗兰克·罗山勃伦也说过类似的话。去年，罢工的次数比美国历史上任何一年都多。这证明美国工人没有被假的爱国主义号召所欺骗。
    不满一年以前，在俄亥俄州的辛辛那提的一次盛大会议上成立了全国黑人劳工会议，代表美国重工业部门内起决定性作用的愈来愈多的黑人工人；他们要求实现朝鲜和平，他们已经在劳工运动中激起了停止战争的要求。
    几百个美国飞行员的事件表明了美国军队中的真正思想情况，这些飞行员是参加过第二次世界大战的后备军官，他们抗议从新服役，他们的抗议如此强大有力，以致不得不让他们退役。在朝鲜被击落的美国第一流驾驶员戴维斯的妻子高呼反对这个无用的战争，这反映出她的悲痛，同时也反映出有孩子在海外的数十万父母们内心的感觉。
    有一个美国退伍军人把他的朝鲜作战服役津贴，捐献给我们一位代表作出席会议的旅费。他在把这笔钱捐献给会议的时候说：在他的部队里，每一个人对于美军的焦土政策和执行这种政策的残暴，都感到毛骨悚然。
    在阿肯色斯州的小石矶城，曾经发生过一桩动人的事。那儿有一个营造商，他的儿子是一名战俘，现在北朝鲜，每当政府公布被俘人员的名单，他就把战俘的父母名单抄写下来，然后写信给这些父母，敦促他们去征集要求停止朝鲜战争的签名。在短短的几星期内，这个完全自发自愿的、与有组织的和平运动丝毫无关的行动，就征集到了将近一百万的签名。寄给全国各地报纸的数万封信和民意测验所表达的就是这种根深柢固的感情。这些信和民意测验都一致要求“立即停火”。
    最后，我们美国代表团的全体代表，同意韩雪野先生的提议，要求在遣俘问题上达成协议，立即完成停战谈判。
    我们认为这是很明白的事情，我们的政治人物签了字，而我们的参议院始终没有批准的日内瓦议定书，必须全部遵守。
    我们和大家一起要求：必须停止细菌战和对朝鲜和平乡村的轰炸。我们号召美国人民注意亚洲人民发出的呼声，要求把策动这些行为的人们当作战争罪犯来惩办。
    我们赞成：为了我们国家的最高利益，美国军队和中国人民志愿军，应在停战协定签字后，同时撤离朝鲜。我们坚决主张：朝鲜人民必须享有决定他们自己的命运的权利，这种权利是每个国家的人民都应该享有的。基于这种精神，我们要在回国后竭尽我们的一切力量，帮助唤醒美国人民。我们决不停息。我们决不缄默，一定要使人民听到我们的声音。　（新华社）
