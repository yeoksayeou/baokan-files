Report on the Inspection of the Production Increase Campaign in Zhaoyuan County

Yu Yifu, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government

This year, the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed scientific farming methods of equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection, which contributed to increasing yield per unit area. According to a symposium at the Yanhai Village Peng Xijiang Production Cooperative in the county, adopting these farming methods generally increased production by one to two times.

Comrade Ren Guodong, the County Party Secretary, went deep into the countryside, studied new things, and proposed this farming method, which unleashed the main potential power of agriculture. He is worthy of praise and of being emulated by leading cadres at all levels in the province. His methods are also worth promoting.

In breaking conservative thinking and promoting the equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection farming method, Zhaoyuan County basically adopted a method of combining the absorption of the masses' inherent advanced experience with science and technology, combining leaders delving into practice with mass creation and production experience, carefully calculating grain yields, and using examples to educate farmers.

According to an investigation by the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee, equal spacing and thinning are originally the inherent advanced experience of farmers. Last year, farmer Fang Chunzhi in the county used this experience to create a record of producing more than 30 *shi* of grain per hectare. After detailed calculation of the various crop densities, the farmers were also very confident in this experience. Rural cadres in Zhaoyuan County generally know how many plants of millet, sorghum, soybeans, corn, etc. are planted per hectare because they have all calculated the densities of these crops. Millet seedlings with a spacing of more than five centimeters (about one and a half inches) develop normally, while seedlings with a spacing of less than five centimeters are smaller. The preliminary view is that it is best to plant two rows per ridge. The wide sowing width is best at twelve to fifteen centimeters (approximately four to four and a half inches). For sorghum, according to trials on the county farm, using a Soviet seeder to sow double-seedlings at equal spacing results in very good growth, with an estimated yield of 30 *shi* per hectare; sowing with a clumsy plow is worse. For sowing distance, for sorghum, generally six plants per five *chi* can be planted on hillsides, and seven or eight plants per five *chi* can be planted in low-lying areas. For soybeans, three plants per *chi* or five plants per two *chi*.

For wide sowing, the old-fashioned gourd used for spot sowing also needs to be improved.

There is a contrasting example of the effect of thinning combined with fertilization: Yu Quanhe of Yibentang Village and Thirty-Level Land can produce 14,500 *jin* of millet per hectare, while Liu Yongjun of Mengkeli Village can only produce 2,500 *jin* of millet per hectare on Thirty-Three-Level Land, a difference of almost five times.

Why is the difference so large?

It turns out that Liu Yongjun used the old method of applying manure once every three years for planting millet. This year, he did not apply manure, topdressing, or thinning, and the millet was as dense as a horse's mane. Yu Quanhe, on the other hand, applied manure for three consecutive years when planting millet. This year, he applied twelve cartloads of soil manure and 300 *jin* of *kangdong youzi* (oil from under the stove), topdressing with 100 *jin* of ammonium sulfate mixed with 500 *jin* of soil, and 100 *jin* of bean cake. After applying ammonium sulfate, he applied another 300 *jin* of manure. When the millet was tasseling, he applied 100 *jin* of small ash and 300 *jin* of soil manure. He also thinned the seedlings three times. Therefore, the yield of millet was also different.

Another point worth mentioning is that the rural Party branches have strengthened their leadership over technology. The County Party Committee called on Party members to learn technology and lead the masses to increase production. A total of 1,350 Party members in 120 branches throughout the county participated in technical research.

Therefore, a technical improvement movement was launched throughout the county. This year, farmers throughout the county proposed to create new records on more than 9,120 hectares of land, to carry out thinning on 27,000 hectares, and topdressing on 26,602 hectares. During the entire hoeing period, the county planned to accumulate 2.1 million cartloads of manure, and by September 1, more than 1 million cartloads had been completed, nearly 50 percent of the plan.

The great significance of the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee's promotion of equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection cultivation method this year lies in breaking the conservative thinking that keeps agricultural production at the current low level, unleashing the potential power of agriculture, and opening up a new path for increasing production throughout the province. This year, individual farmers in the county proposed a plan to create a yield of 100 *shi* of grain per hectare, but it was not realized due to floods, droughts and other conditions (such as inappropriate autumn plowing, manure application, soil selection, etc.), and lack of experience in piloting new technologies this year. However, the Soviet Union has a record of harvesting 42,000 *jin* of grain per hectare, proving that this plan can be gradually achieved. And records like Yu Quanhe's of more than 30 *shi* of millet per hectare are estimated to be found in 40 to 50 places throughout the county. If all counties in the province follow suit and promote this method, it will be beneficial to carry out the provincial party committee's proposed New Record Movement of a thousand villages and ten thousand groups.

In terms of leadership methods, the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee adopted the method of using Mengkeli Village in the Second District, Zhiyuan Village in the Twelfth District, and Sihe Village in the Seventh District as demonstration points, introducing experience, universally launching visits, and organizing visits to the three agricultural production cooperatives in these three villages by thousands of people. In more than half a year, 8,000 farmers throughout the county have visited the county demonstration farm. The visiting farmers are most interested in new agricultural tools. Some farmers, seeing the superiority displayed by agricultural production cooperatives in production, are all yearning for them. These visits have greatly promoted the equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection cultivation method and the promotion of new records.

In the education on the new and old paths and patriotic education, the class consciousness of Party members and the masses has been raised, and the farmers are following the new path pointed out by the Communist Party, advancing towards collectivization through cooperation. For example, Wang Zhentang, a provincial-level special labor model, thoroughly reviewed his old path thinking. After attending the provincial production cooperative meeting in mid-August, he returned home and immediately sought help from the district committee to study how to improve the leadership of the production cooperative. Yu Lu, the branch secretary of Zhiyuan Village in the Twelfth District, reviewed his idea of becoming a shareholder in a restaurant. Guo Zhongxiao, the branch secretary of Yanhai Village, reviewed his mistake of hiring laborers to carry grain. The Party's class education has had a major impact.

It must be pointed out that raising the level of awareness of farmers, making them aware of the benefits of taking the new path, and steadily moving towards cooperation are the main keys to carrying out the patriotic agricultural production increase movement and improving agricultural technology. It should be explained here that the Party and the state have not changed social policies related to borrowing and hiring labor, and the regulations prohibiting exploitation still stand. However, the requirements are for Communist Party members, and the masses are not required to abolish their exploitative behavior in the same way as Party members. But they should be educated to understand that only by taking the new path can everyone become rich and achieve a new society. The backwardness of small-scale farming should be explained. Marx said:

"The more the land is divided, the more its fertility decreases in the same proportion. The use of machinery on the land, division of labor, large-scale land improvement methods such as drainage and irrigation equipment, etc., become increasingly impossible. On the contrary, the cost of cultivation increases in the same proportion as the division of the means of production themselves." ("The Class Struggles in France," Liberation Press, page 151). Class education and patriotic education should be carried out patiently and repeatedly for the farmers, and the patriotic production increase movement should be continued to improve and consolidate mutual aid and cooperation organizations, so that the rural cooperative movement can develop healthily.

The Zhaoyuan County bumper harvest movement this year has achieved results. It is hoped that the county Party committee, government, and all the people will make persistent efforts and continue to improve.

    关于肇源县增产运动的检查报告
    黑龙江省人民政府主席  于毅夫
    今年中共肇源县委提出了等距、宽播、间苗、保苗的科学耕作方法，对提高单位面积产量是有贡献的。据该县沿海村彭希江生产合作社座谈，采用这种耕作方法后，一般的可增产一倍到两倍。
    该县县委书记任国栋同志深入农村，钻研新事物，提出这一耕作方法，发挥农业的主要潜在力量，是值得表扬的，值得全省各级领导干部学习，其方法也是可以推广的。
    在打破保守思想，推广等距宽播间苗保苗耕作法时，肇源县基本上采取了吸收群众固有的先进经验与科学技术相结合，领导深入实践与群众创造及生产经验相结合的方法，算打粮细账，并用实例向农民进行教育。
    经肇源县委调查，等距间苗原是农民固有的先进经验。去年该县农民方纯志就采用这个经验创造了每垧打三十余石谷子的纪录。经过详细算各种庄稼槎口的细账，农民也很相信这种经验。肇源县的农村干部一般都已知道谷子、高粱、黄豆、苞米等每垧有多少棵，因为他们都已算过这些庄稼槎口细账。谷苗的距离在五公分（约一寸五分）以上的发育正常，距离在五公分以下的苗较小，初步意见是每垅以种两行为好。宽播播幅以十二公分到十五公分（即约四寸到四寸五）为好。高粱，根据该县农场试种，用苏联播种机双苗眼等距播种，长得很好，每垧估计可打三十石；用笨犁种的较差。播种距离，高粱，一般岗地可以五尺六棵，洼地可以五尺七、八棵。大豆，每尺三棵或每二尺五棵。
    为了宽播，旧式点种用的葫芦也需要改良。
    间苗结合施肥的效果，有一个对比的例子，一本堂村于泉和三十级地一垧谷子可打一万四千五百斤，孟克里村刘永钧三十三级地一垧谷子反只能打二千五百斤，几乎相差五倍。
    为什么相差这样悬殊呢？    
    原来刘永钧种谷子用三年一槎粪的老办法，今年没上粪、没追肥、没间苗，谷子密得像马鬃。于泉和种谷子则三年连着上粪，今年上土粪十二车、炕洞油子三百斤，追肥：一百斤硫铵拌五百斤土、一百斤豆?，追完硫铵又上三百斤大粪，谷子莠穗时上一百斤小灰、三百斤土粪；又进行了三次间苗；所以谷子的产量也就不同了。
    另外值得提出的，是农村党支部加强了对技术的领导。县委号召党员学习技术，领导群众增产。全县有一百二十个支部一千三百五十个党员参加了技术研究。
    因此，在全县掀起了提高技术运动。今年全县农民提出要创造新纪录的土地有九千一百二十多垧，要实行间苗的有二万七千垧，追肥的二万六千六百零二垧。全县挂锄期间计划积肥二百一十万车，到九月一日，已完成一百余万车，几达计划的百分之五十。
    肇源县委今年提倡等距、宽播、间苗、保苗的培植法的重大意义，在于打破了使农业生产停止在现在低下水平的保守思想，发挥了农业的潜在力量，对全省增产开辟了新的道路。今年该县个别农民提出了要创造每垧打一百石粮的计划，虽因水旱灾和其他条件（如秋翻地、上粪施肥、土质选择等不尽适当），及今年试行新技术无经验而没有实现；但苏联已有每垧收获四万二千斤粮的纪录，证明这计划是可以逐渐做到的。而像于泉和每垧谷子打三十余石的纪录，估计全县可有四、五十处。全省各县都仿效推行这办法，这对于开展省委提出的千村万组新纪录运动，是有好处的。
    肇源县委在领导方法上，采取以二区孟克里村、十二区支援村、七区的四合村为点，介绍经验，普遍发动参观，组织到这三个村的三个农业生产合作社参观的人达数千人。半年多来，全县农民到县示范农场参观者已达八千人。参观的农民对新农具最感兴趣。有些农民看到农业生产合作社在生产中显示的优越性，都心向往之。这种参观对于等距宽播、间苗保苗的培植法和新纪录的推广都起很大推动作用。
    在新旧道路教育和爱国主义教育中，党员与群众的阶级觉悟都提高了，农民正在循着共产党所指出的新道路，经过合作化向集体化前进。如省特等劳动模范王振堂比较彻底地检讨了自己的旧道路思想。他参加八月中旬省召开的生产合作社会议后，回家即找区委帮助研究如何提高生产合作社的领导。十二区支援村的支部书记于禄检讨了自己要作饭馆子股东的思想。沿海村支部书记郭忠孝检讨了自己抬粮雇工的错误，党的阶级教育已起了重大影响。
    必须指出：提高农民的觉悟程度，使之认识走新道路的好处，稳步走向合作化是开展农业爱国增产运动，提高农业技术的主要关键。这里应说明：党和国家对有关借贷雇工等社会政策并没有改变，不准有剥削行为的规定，只是对共产党员的要求，对群众并不要求和党员一样地一律取消其剥削行为，但应教育其认识只有走新道路才能使大家富裕，达到新社会。应说明小农经营的落后性。马克思说过：
    “土地越分割，其丰产性就按照同一比例而递减。在土地上使用机器，分工，大规模的改良土地方法如排水灌溉设备等等，都日益不可能施行。反之，耕作底冗费却按照生产工具本身底分割之同一比例而递增。”（“法兰西阶级斗争”解放社出版、第一五一页）要对农民反复地耐心进行阶级教育与爱国教育，继续开展爱国增产运动，提高与巩固互助合作组织，使农村合作化运动健康发展。
    今年肇源县丰产运动是有成绩的，还希望该县的党委、政府与全体人民再接再厉，继续提高一步。
