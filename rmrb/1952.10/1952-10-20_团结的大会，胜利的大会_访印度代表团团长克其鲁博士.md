    A Congress of Unity, A Congress of Victory
    —An Interview with Dr. Kitchlew, Head of the Indian Delegation
    By Our Correspondent Li Wen
    The Indian delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was elected by various people's organizations based on the vigorously developing peace movement in India. The delegation includes social celebrities, long-time Gandhi followers, and non-partisan figures; members of the Indian National Congress, as well as members of the Indian Communist Party; nationally renowned poets, as well as famous businessmen and engineers; prominent economists and university professors, as well as outstanding dancers and musicians; famous doctors from the northern provinces, as well as excellent film directors from South India; trade union workers from various regions, leaders of the women's movement, as well as representatives of youth and students. They come from all regions of India, with various different political views and various different professions, but they all came to Beijing with a common wish—peace.
    When the reporter interviewed Dr. Kitchlew, the head of the Indian delegation, after introducing the delegation's situation, he emphasized: "Our delegation came to attend this conference bearing the peace wishes of hundreds of millions of Indian people. It can be said that peace-loving people from all walks of life in India have their own representatives here."
    Dr. Kitchlew highly praised the achievements of this peace conference. He said: "The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, which recently concluded in Beijing, was extraordinary in all aspects. And one of the most noteworthy things is that many people with different opinions—often opposing opinions—were able to come together and unanimously agree on every resolution of the conference."
    "What is the source of this miracle?" He continued excitedly: "I think this miracle comes from the urgency of the current world situation and the spirit of full democracy and consultation in the conference's proceedings. When women and children in Korea are being bombed and injured every day, when massacres are being carried out arbitrarily in the villages of Vietnam and Malaya, who would not be willing to do their utmost to reach an agreement with those who demand no more bloodshed?
    "However, the reason why this effort has yielded abundant results is due to the meticulous and organized way of working, which allows the smallest details to be fully and carefully exchanged. In subcommittees and dozens or hundreds of informal and formal discussions, all issues were resolved. Every representative's point of view was included in the resolutions, and every representative worked together to ensure that any representative's point of view was included in the resolutions. As a result, the resolutions became a collective result of all representatives' various points of view.
    "Observing the wonderful progress of this conference is an education in itself. We, with such different opinions on so many important peace issues, were able to reach a consensus, which gives us great confidence."
    Sharing the feelings of peace and friendship at the peace conference and deeply moved by this feeling, Dr. Kitchlew naturally spoke to the reporter about that unforgettable scene, the scene when Indian and Pakistani representatives signed a joint statement in front of all peace representatives. He vividly described the mood of every Indian representative at the time: "All the representatives automatically and wholeheartedly welcomed the joint statement of the Indian and Pakistani delegations, and the Indian delegation was greatly encouraged. We suddenly felt that the great heart of the people in the Asian and Pacific regions was beating as loudly and excitedly as our hearts; we saw tears of joy welling up on the faces of these people, just like the tears flowing on the faces of our Indian and Pakistani people. We realized—we had not realized before—that we are all brothers, that nothing can separate us, that our happiness is common, that our wishes are common, and that the imperialists' conspiracies can never separate us." He said:
    "There were also many unforgettable scenes in the venue: for example, when the Indian delegation presented gifts to the Korean delegation, or when the Costa Rican delegation presented a medal of honor to the Chinese people, our whole being was filled with noble pleasure."
    Dr. Kitchlew also emphasized that the joint statement of the Indian and Pakistani delegations will certainly be warmly welcomed by the peace-loving people of both countries. This declaration is a very powerful first step towards mutual understanding between the people of the two countries. It establishes some principles which, if widely publicized and accepted on both sides, can have a decisive impact on the relations between India and Pakistan.
    During their stay in Beijing, the Indian delegation met with delegations from some other countries and exchanged views with them. Dr. Kitchlew said: "We felt particularly pleased that we had the opportunity to dine with the Korean delegation to consolidate the relationship of unity and friendship between our two peoples; we entertained the Vietnamese delegation and learned a lot from them; we also had the opportunity to listen to the Japanese delegation's talks and Mrs. Felton's visit to Korea. We met with the American delegation during lunch, and also met informally with delegations from some Latin American countries. Moreover, our representatives participated separately in a series of meetings of colleagues almost every day: writers and writers, doctors and doctors, trade union workers and trade union workers from other countries, these meetings had great value. We have established friendships with each other, friendships that we will never forget and hope will continue to last forever. Our friendship, the friendship between the peoples of all countries, is the great guarantee that we will be able to prevent war."
    Finally, this seventy-year-old peace warrior told the reporter with confidence: "This peace conference and its resolutions will play an important role in strengthening the peace movement in India. After the delegation returns home, it will propose to organize representatives to travel around the country to report on the conference. In mid-November, we will convene an All-India Peace Conference Council, at which time the detailed plan for implementing the Beijing Peace Conference in India will be drawn up."

    团结的大会，胜利的大会
    ——访印度代表团团长克其鲁博士
    本报记者  力文
    出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的印度代表团，是在印度蓬勃发展的和平运动的基础上由各人民团体推选出来的。代表团包括社会名流，多年的甘地主义者和无党派人士；有印度国大党党员，也有印度共产党党员；有全国闻名的诗人，也有著名的商业家和工程师；有著名的经济学者和大学教授，也有出色的舞蹈家和音乐家；有来自北部各省的名医生，也有来自南印的优秀的电影导演；有来自各地的工会工作者，有妇女运动的领袖，也有青年和学生的代表。他们来自全印各个地区，有着各种不同的政治见解，和各种不同的职业，但他们都怀着一个共同的愿望——和平——来到北京。
    当记者访问印度代表团团长克其鲁博士的时候，他介绍了代表团的情况之后，着重指出：“我们代表团是肩负着亿万印度人民的和平愿望来出席这次会议的。可以这样说，印度各阶层爱好和平的人民，都有他们自己的代表来了。”
    克其鲁博士盛赞这次和平会议的成就。他说：“最近在北京结束的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在各方面都是非凡的。而其中最值得注意的一件事是许多不同意见的人们——常常是意见相反的人们——能在一起，并一致同意大会的每一个决议。”
    “这个奇迹的来源是什么呢？”他接着兴奋地说下去：“我想这个奇迹的得来，乃是由于今日世界形势的迫切性及会议进行中那种充分民主和协商的精神。当朝鲜的妇女儿童每天遭受轰炸杀伤，当越南、马来亚的乡村中，屠杀正在恣意进行，有谁不愿意以他全副的力量来努力与那些要求不再流血的人们取得协议呢？
    “然而，这种努力所以能得到丰盛的成果，乃是由于周密的有组织的工作方式，它使最小的细节问题，都能充分地仔细地交换意见。在小组委员会及数十次上百次非正式和正式的讨论中，所有问题都得到了解决。每一位代表的观点包括在决议中，每一位代表并一致努力让任何代表的观点都包括在决议之中。结果，决议成为所有代表各种观点的集体成果。
    “观察这个会议的美妙进行，它本身就是一种教育。在那么多重要的和平问题上，意见如此不相同的我们，能取得一致意见，这给予我们极大的信心。”
    在和平会议上，分享着和平与友谊的感情，并为这种感情深为感动的克其鲁博士，很自然地向记者谈起那个令人难忘的场面，印度代表与巴基斯坦代表在所有和平代表面前，签署联合声明时的场面，他生动地描述着当时每个印度代表的心情：“所有代表们自动地衷心地欢迎印、巴代表团的联合声明，印度代表团受到莫大鼓舞。我们突然感觉到亚洲及太平洋区域人民伟大的心，与我们的心一样高声地兴奋地跳动着；我们看到在这些人们的脸上喜悦的热泪夺眶而出，就像流在我们印度和巴基斯坦人民脸上的热泪一样。我们认识到——以前我们尚未认识到——我们都是兄弟，任何东西不能使我们分离，我们的幸福是共同的，我们的愿望是共同的，帝国主义的阴谋决不能把我们分离。”他说：
    “在会场里还有许多使人永远不能忘怀的情景：例如，当印度代表团向朝鲜代表团敬赠礼物的时候，或当哥斯达黎加代表团向中国人民敬赠荣誉勋章的时候，在我们整个身心中充满了高尚的愉快。”
    克其鲁博士还着重指出：印度和巴基斯坦两国代表团的联合声明，必将广泛地受到两国爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎。这个宣言是两国人民之间互相了解的非常有力的第一步。它确定了一些原则，这些原则，假如在两方面都普遍地得到宣传和接受的话，能对印、巴两国的关系起决定性的影响。
    印度代表团在逗留北京期间，曾会见了一些其他国家的代表团，并和他们交换了意见。克其鲁博士说：“我们感觉到特别高兴的是：我们曾经有过和朝鲜代表团聚餐的机会，来巩固我们两国人民团结与友爱的关系；我们欢宴越南代表团，向他们学习了不少的东西；我们还有机会听取了日本代表团的谈话，和费尔顿夫人访问朝鲜的谈话。我们在共进午餐当中会见了美国代表团，同时非正式地会见了拉丁美洲一些国家的代表团。不仅如此，我们的代表们差不多每天都分别参加了一连串的同行的会议：作家和作家，医生和医生，工会工作者和其他国家的工会工作者的会议，这些会议都有着巨大的价值。我们彼此之间建立了友谊，这种友谊，我们绝不会忘记，希望它不断地继续下去，以至永久，永久。我们之间的友爱，各国人民之间的友爱，是我们将能阻止战争的伟大的保证。”
    最后，这位七十高龄的和平战士，满怀信心地告诉记者：“这次和平大会和它的决议，对加强印度的和平运动将起着重要的作用。代表团回国后，将提议组织代表们到全国各地旅行，作关于大会情况的报告。在十一月中旬，我们将召开一个全印和平会议理事会，那时候，北京和平会议在印度付诸实施的详细计划就要订出来了。”
