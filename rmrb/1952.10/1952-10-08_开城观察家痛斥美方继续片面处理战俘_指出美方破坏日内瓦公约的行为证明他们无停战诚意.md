Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. Following the arbitrary massacre of 165 captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel by the US in Jeju Island, they are now brazenly continuing to unilaterally handle prisoners of war. According to a statement made on the 5th of this month by the US prisoner of war camp authorities: the first batch of 600 prisoners of war out of the 11,000 prisoners of war previously prepared to be handed over to the Syngman Rhee gang under the guise of “release,” will be “released” on the 6th, and the remaining prisoners of war will also be "released" within this month. This is further evidence that the US is determined not to resolve the prisoner of war issue through negotiations.

Observers here point out that the US's provocative act of violating the Geneva Convention and unilaterally handling prisoners of war clearly indicates that they have no sincerity for a ceasefire. At the recent plenary session of both delegations, Harrison even proposed so-called "plans" such as sending all prisoners of war to the demilitarized zone "to be checked against the agreed prisoner of war list." The only agreed-upon prisoner of war list between the two sides is the list exchanged on December 18th of last year. The US is now brazenly continuing to unilaterally handle prisoners of war, which completely exposes Harrison's hypocrisy and shows that the US is actually deliberately obstructing the resolution of the prisoner of war issue.

Observers here also pointed out that the US's so-called "release" of prisoners of war is in fact sending them to the Rhee's (South Korean) army to replace the American soldiers who are dying in large numbers in the war of aggression. As the casualties of the US military invading Korea have recently increased sharply, American reactionaries such as Eisenhower and Dulles are clamoring for more Rhee's troops to be used as cannon fodder. However, the losses of Rhee's army are now also increasing day by day. In the twelve days of the middle of last month, the Rhee's army's Gyeonggi Division, praised by the US as an "elite force," suffered 1,800 casualties by the Korean and Chinese troops in the Jin-cheng southeast of the central front simply for the sake of seizing two hilltops. Recently, the Rhee's Marine Corps on the Kaesong front suffered another disastrous defeat, with more than 1,000 casualties in a few days. The US's conspiracy to collect cannon fodder by unilaterally handling prisoners of war will never save them from their doomed fate.

### 开城观察家痛斥美方继续片面处理战俘  指出美方破坏日内瓦公约的行为证明他们无停战诚意

    开城观察家痛斥美方继续片面处理战俘
    指出美方破坏日内瓦公约的行为证明他们无停战诚意 【新华社开城七日电】美方在济州岛任意屠杀一百六十五名中国人民志愿军被俘人员以后，现在又明目张胆地继续擅自片面处理战俘。据美方战俘营当局本月五日宣称：前曾准备以“释放”为名移交给李承晚匪帮的一万一千名战俘中的第一批共六百名战俘，将在六日“释放”，其余的战俘也将在本月内“释放”。这是美方决意不用谈判方式解决战俘问题的又一证据。
    此间观察家指出：美方这种破坏日内瓦公约，片面处理战俘的挑衅行为，明白表示他们对停战毫无诚意。在最近一次双方代表团大会上，哈利逊还提出把全部战俘送到非军事区“与协议的战俘名单相校核”之类的所谓“方案”。双方协议的唯一一份战俘名单就是去年十二月十八日交换的名单。美方现在竟擅自继续片面处理战俘，这就彻底暴露了哈利逊的伪善，显示出美方实际是在蓄意阻挠战俘问题的解决。
    此间观察家并指出：美方所谓“释放”战俘，事实上就是把他们送到李伪军中去代替在侵略战争中大批送死的美国士兵。由于侵朝美军的伤亡最近剧增，美国反动头子如艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯之流都在叫喊要用更多的李伪军去挡头阵。可是李伪军的损失现在也日益增加了。在上月中旬的十二天内，被美方夸奖为“精锐部队”的李伪军京畿师在中线金城东南仅仅为了争夺两个山头，就被朝中部队杀伤一千八百名。最近开城前线的李伪军海军陆战队又遭受惨败，几天内被杀伤一千多名。美方这种用片面处理战俘来搜罗炮灰的阴谋，决不能挽救他们失败的命运。
