Xinhua News Agency, New York, 19th: According to TASS, at the afternoon session of the United Nations General Assembly on October 17, the General Assembly passed the recommendation made by the General Committee regarding the allocation of various proposals on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly to various committees, with only one slight modification.

The United Nations General Assembly then continued the general debate.

After the representative of Liberia spoke, the Polish Foreign Minister Skrzeszewski spoke, exposing the US policy of aggression and war preparations, and emphasizing that the United Nations must become an instrument for promoting peace, and put forward a proposal aimed at enabling the United Nations to fulfill its responsibilities.

The Polish proposal suggests immediately ceasing military actions in Korea; repatriating all prisoners of war in accordance with international rules; all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, should withdraw from Korea within two or three months; peacefully resolving the Korean issue, enabling the Korean people to unify Korea under the supervision of a committee composed of relevant countries and other countries (including countries that have not participated in this war).

The proposal also advocates that the United Nations General Assembly, in order to prevent the threat of a new world war, should recommend that the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France and China – the permanent members of the Security Council – reduce their armed forces by one-third within one year and submit full information regarding their armaments. At the same time, the United Nations General Assembly should recommend that the Security Council convene an international conference in the shortest possible time to achieve disarmament of all countries in the world; a resolution should be adopted immediately to unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and to establish a strict international supervision system for the implementation of this resolution by all countries; the United Nations General Assembly should require all countries that have not acceded to the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925 on the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, as well as countries that have not ratified this protocol, to participate in and ratify this protocol.

The Polish proposal further advocates that the United Nations General Assembly should declare that United Nations member states shall not participate in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc; the United Nations General Assembly should urge the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France and China to sign a peace pact, with the aim of reducing the armaments of major powers and consolidating international peace; the United Nations General Assembly should also urge all other countries to participate in this pact.

After the Polish Foreign Minister spoke, the Canadian representative Martin spoke about the Korean issue, expressing the hope that the General Assembly would "not complicate the work of the United Nations military negotiators." He also said that the Canadian delegation, in considering the Korean issue, believes that a "basic premise is that the current war must be limited to the Korean Peninsula, and efforts to seek an early resolution in Panmunjom must continue." The meeting adjourned until October 18, when the general debate will resume.

    波兰外长在联合国大会上揭发美国侵略政策
    建议停止军事行动和平解决朝鲜问题
    主张中苏美英法五大国签订和平公约裁减军备
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会在十月十七日下午的会议上通过了总务委员会提出的关于把联合国大会议程中的各项议案分配给各个委员会的建议，仅有一处稍加修改。
    联合国大会然后继续一般辩论。
    在利比里亚代表发言之后，波兰外交部长斯克列杰夫斯基发言，他揭发了美国的侵略政策和战争准备，并着重指出联合国必须成为一个促进和平的工具，并提出了一个旨在使联合国能履行它的职责的提案。
    波兰的提案建议立刻停止在朝鲜的军事行动；根据国际规则遣返所有战俘；所有外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军在内，在两、三个月之内一律撤出朝鲜；和平解决朝鲜问题，使朝鲜人民能在一个委员会的监督下统一朝鲜，这个委员会应由有关国家与其它国家（包括没有参加这次战争的国家在内）组成。
    提案并主张：联合国大会，为了防止新世界大战的威胁，应该建议美国、苏联、英国、法国和中国——安全理事会的常任理事国——在一年内把它们的武装部队裁减三分之一并提出关于它们的军备的充分情报，同时联合国大会应建议安全理事会在可能的最短期间内召集国际会议，以实现世界各国的裁减军备；应立即通过决议以实现无条件禁用原子武器和其它大规模毁灭的武器，并对于各国执行这个决议的情况建立一个严格的国际监督制度；联合国大会应要求所有没有参加一九二五年六月十七日关于禁用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的国家以及没有批准这个议定书的国家参加并批准这个议定书。
    波兰提案更主张：联合国大会应宣布联合国会员国不得参加北大西洋侵略集团；联合国大会应敦促美国、苏联、英国、法国和中国政府签订一个和平公约，目的在裁减大国军备，巩固国际和平；联合国大会同时应敦促所有其它国家参加这个公约。
    波兰外交部长发言后，加拿大代表马丁发言谈论朝鲜问题，他表示希望大会“不要使联合国军谈判代表的工作更加复杂化”。又说，加拿大代表团在考虑朝鲜问题的时候，认为一个“基本前提就是，目前的战争必须限于朝鲜半岛，在板门店寻求早日解决的努力必须继续下去”。会议至此休会到十月十八日再举行，届时将恢复一般辩论。拉维·山加尔·史佛兰姆·维亚斯雅士万特·舒克拉  高普兰沙尔玛    南第阿米亚·穆克吉  罗米西·钱德拉阿尔文德·梅达    南德拉尔·达尔撒拉·古普塔  乌玛·山加尔·约希卡比拉本·梅达  马诺哈·拉尔·沙阿卓金德拉·库玛·班那吉  苏波德·班纳吉杰安·昌德  马高拉尔·巴立克普里斯维·辛格  克里什纳斯瓦米
