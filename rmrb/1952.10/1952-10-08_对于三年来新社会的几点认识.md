Some Understandings of the New Society in the Past Three Years
Feng Youlan

The history of China in the past three years is fundamentally different from the history of the previous thousands of years. The history of these three years is that we have consciously created it according to an overall plan and in accordance with certain steps. This overall plan is the Common Program—the Magna Carta of the Chinese people. This overall plan is formulated under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and based on the laws of historical development. We are in control of our own destiny, consciously, purposefully, and step by step, creating our happy future.

Our new society is consciously built up according to the laws of historical development. Only under such a social system can all things be carried out according to the laws of historical development, in a planned and step-by-step manner. Only by carrying out all things in this way can we have all the great achievements and brilliant victories of the past three years.

Without the full mobilization of the enthusiasm and creativity of every individual in the broad masses of the people, there could not have been all the achievements and victories of the past three years. Among these many achievements and victories, the vast majority, from a purely technical point of view, are simply impossible and unimaginable. Judging solely from the perspective of weapons and equipment, it is unimaginable how our Volunteer Army, armed only with rifles and grenades, could defeat the army that called itself the "world's number one power" once they crossed the Yalu River. Judging solely from the perspective of mechanical tools, it is also unimaginable how a large project like the Jingjiang River Diversion could be completed in seventy-five days. Judging solely from the perspective of sanitation facilities, it is even more unimaginable how 475 million people across the vast expanse of the country could, in a matter of months, improve their understanding of hygiene, improve environmental sanitation, and defeat the inhumane bacteriological warfare of American imperialism. These things, which seem impossible from a purely technical point of view, have all become facts in the past three years. This is all due to the power generated by the enthusiasm and creativity of the people under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. The imperialists cannot see the existence of such a huge people's power, and can only plan their aggression within the limits of their imagination, so they fail at every turn and run into walls everywhere.

If the broad masses of the people were not liberated and awakened, it would have been impossible to unleash their enthusiasm and creativity. In the past, when the people were under the oppressed and exploited social system, the result of their hard work was only the wealth of others and their own poverty. No one was willing to actively create their own poverty. But after the masses of the people were liberated from the system of exploitation, they realized that they had become the masters of society, recognized that the government was their own government, and understood that the things the government was doing to lead the people were all beneficial to the people. At this time, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of the people became unstoppable. The people had been shackled for too long under reactionary rule. The greatness of their potential is inestimable. In our new society, the people's potential has only just begun to be unleashed, and many miracles have already appeared. In the future, of course, there will be even more miracles.

Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the Chinese people consciously advance rapidly according to the laws of historical development and in accordance with a definite plan. Because only the philosophy of Marxism-Leninism can discover the laws of historical development. Only the Communist Party can grasp the laws of social development. And only the Communist Party can lead the working people to achieve a thorough liberation, completely liberate themselves from reactionary rule, and establish their own government. In short, only under the superior social system under the leadership of the Communist Party are our achievements and victories of the past three years possible. Saying this may seem superfluous, but before liberation, many people (including myself), and even now there are many people in the world who believe that any class party, as long as it has political power, "discovers its conscience," and makes an effort, can build a country rapidly like we have in the past three years. The above can prove that such thinking is wrong. There are also many people who believe that the victories and achievements of our past three years are mainly due to the wisdom, competence, integrity, and public service of the people in the government. The above can also prove that such a view is superficial. Only a party and government that actively strives for the interests of the people can lead all the people to accomplish such great achievements.

The above-mentioned enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses can already dispel a doubt. The doubt is: Are the masses who participate in large projects and mass movements forced to do so? In the past, governments in society used either coercion or bribery for the people, and there was no other way. Some people look at our mass movements with this view, they think: The number of people is too large, bribery seems impossible, then it must be coercion. The fact is that coercion is incompatible with enthusiasm and creativity. You may coerce a person to do some routine things. You can coerce a person to do some things that you order him to do, but you cannot coerce him to develop enthusiasm and creativity. Only in a conscious and voluntary situation can people have enthusiasm and creativity.

Before liberation, there were many people (including myself), and even now there are many people in the world, who, with a literal interpretation of the "matter" in the materialist theory of Marxism-Leninism, believe that in a society led by the Communist Party, there is probably progress in "material" aspects but decline in "spiritual" aspects. Some people worry and ask: China has always had a tradition of respecting morality, is it now being abandoned?

There is a saying: "Don't be afraid of not knowing the goods, just be afraid of comparing goods." The countless new things that have happened to us in the past three years fully prove that our new democratic society is higher than the previous society. It is higher not only in the economic life of the people, but in all aspects. The improvement in morality is particularly significant.

The moral ideals proposed by people in the past, such as the Chinese philosopher's "universal love and mutual benefit," the Western philosopher's "the greatest happiness of the greatest number," and the religious person's "everyone for me, I for everyone," are only an ideal, unattainable for the vast majority of people; in our society, our moral standard of "serving the people wholeheartedly," has become the practical goal of ordinary people in just three years. In the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, everyone is consciously serving the people without avoiding any danger; the labor models in various production departments are all consciously serving the people by overcoming all difficulties. In the past three years, everyone in society has been morally improved, realizing the great event of "changing customs" that has been often mentioned but never realized in Chinese books before. If it were not in a society led by the Communist Party, this would also be impossible.

Only under the social system established by the Communist Party can the interests of the individual and the interests of society be combined. In the society ruled by the reactionaries, the so-called "social interests" are mainly the interests of the reactionaries. This conflicts with the interests of the people. In pre-liberation society, advocating "everyone for me, I for everyone" was just empty talk. In liberated society, the interests of society are also the interests of the individual. Everyone serves the people, and is also among the people, which is truly "everyone for me, I for everyone."

Therefore, in our society, there is no problem of the opposition and conflict between individual freedom and social organization. Because in our society, the interests of the individual and the interests of society are inseparable. Therefore, the freedom of the individual and the freedom of the collective are also inseparable. We study science in order to conquer nature and give the people freedom in the face of nature, the freedom of the people is also the freedom of every individual. We resist America and aid Korea in order to protect our motherland from the threat of imperialism and give the motherland freedom. The freedom of the motherland is also the freedom of every individual. In the struggle against imperialism and in the struggle with nature, we must organize and struggle together, the more tightly organized, the greater the success. The greatest pleasure in life is when a person feels that he has contributed a part to these many efforts to win freedom. The more one stands where the people need him most, the easier it is to have such pleasure.

Our great achievements and brilliant victories in the past three years are by no means accidental. This is the inevitable result of the new social system under the leadership of the Communist Party. The achievements of the past three years have made everyone realize the superiority of the new social system. With such an understanding, he understands the true meaning of "progress" and "backwardness," and he must be willing and hope to quickly discard everything that the old social system gave him and merge with the new society. This process is the process of ideological remolding. In the process of ideological remolding, we feel even more the greatness of the Communist Party. The Greek philosopher Plato quoted a myth saying: God is not jealous, so he created man to be similar to him. Before the working class appeared, no one wanted another person to be exactly like him. Teachers teaching apprentices always leave one or two tricks, fearing that the apprentice will be exactly like him. But the working class is not jealous, and extremely welcomes everyone to be the working class. It welcomes everyone to be exactly like it in status and thought, in order to work together to create a socialist society, to achieve the highest ideal of mankind.

The above are some of my understandings of our new society. I feel that my understanding is still very shallow and may still have errors. But in the past three years, even the smallest progress of each person is part of the achievements of our People's Republic. "Mount Tai does not refuse soil," so I also wrote it out to commemorate the third anniversary of the People's Republic of China.

According to what has been said above, our People's Republic has made great achievements and brilliant victories in all aspects in the past three years. But this is only the beginning of the beginning of our work. What we urgently need is to carry out our construction in a peaceful international environment and move from new democracy to socialism. This is the wish of the Chinese people and the wish of the people all over the world. Just as we celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, representatives of the people of countries in Asia and the Pacific region have come to our capital to hold a peace conference. The success of this conference will give us one more guarantee for the construction of our new society. This conference is bound to succeed, because it is supported by the people of Asia and the Pacific region, and also supported by the people of the world.

    对于三年来新社会的几点认识
    冯友兰
    中国近三年的历史，与以前几千年的历史有根本上的不同。这三年的历史，是我们照着一个总计划，按着一定的步骤有意识地创造出来的。这个总计划，就是共同纲领——中国人民的大宪章，这个总计划，是在马列主义、毛泽东思想指导之下，根据历史发展的规律而制定的。我们是自己掌握了自己的命运，自觉地、有计划地、有步骤地创造我们的幸福前途。
    我们的新社会，就是根据历史发展的规律有意识地建立起来的。只有在这样的社会制度下，才能使
    一切的事情都根据历史发展的规律，有计划地、有步骤地进行。只有使一切的事情都这样的进行，才能有过去三年中所有的伟大的成就与辉煌的胜利。
    没有广大的人民群众充分发挥每一个人的积极性与创造力，也不可能有过去三年中所有的成就与胜利。在这许多成就与胜利之中，有绝大部分，从纯技术观点看，简直是不可能的，是不能想像的。专从武器装备的观点看，我们的只拿着步枪、手榴弹的志愿军一过鸭绿江，怎样就能打败自命为“世界第一强国”的军队，是不能想像的。专从机械工具的观点看，如荆江分洪那样的大工程，怎样能在七十五天之内完成，也是不能想像的。专从卫生设备的观点看，在全国广大范围之内，四亿七千五百万人怎样在几个月之内，都提高了对卫生的认识，改善了环境卫生，打败了美帝国主义惨无人道的细菌战，更是不能想象的。这些从纯技术观点看是不可能的事，在过去三年中，都已成为事实。这都是由于在毛主席、共产党的正确领导下，人民群众的积极性与创造性所发生的力量。帝国主义者，看不到这样巨大的人民的力量的存在，只可能在他的想像之内，计划他们的侵略，所以节节失败，处处碰壁。
    广大的人民群众若不是解放了，觉悟了，也就不可能发挥出来积极性与创造性。过去的时候，人民群众处在被压迫、被剥削的社会制度下，辛勤劳动的结果，只是别人的发财，自己的贫困。没有人愿意积极地去创造自己的贫困。可是在人民群众从剥削制度解放出来后，觉悟到自己成了社会底主人，认识到政府是自己的政府，了解到政府领导人民所作的事情，都是对人民有利的。在这时候，人民群众底积极性与创造性，就一发而不可遏。人民在反动统治下被束缚的时间太长了。他们的潜力的伟大，是难以估计的。在我们的新社会中，人民的潜力刚才发挥，就已经出现了很多奇迹。在将来当然还有更多的奇迹出现。
    只有在共产党的领导下，中国人民才能有意识地根据历史发展的规律，照着一定的计划飞速前进。因为只有马克思列宁主义的哲学，才能发现历史发展的规律。只有共产党才能掌握社会发展的规律。也只有共产党才能领导劳动人民获得彻底的翻身，从反动统治下完全解放出来，建立了自己的政府。总之，只有在共产党领导下的优越的社会制度下，我们过去三年的成就与胜利才是可能的。这句话说出来似乎是多余的，但是在解放以前有不少的人
    （包括我在内），现在世界上也还有不少的人认为，无论那一个阶级的政党，只要有了政权，“良心发现”，努一把力，都可能像我们过去三年一样，飞速地建设一个国家。上面所说，可以证明这样的思想是错误的。也还有不少的人认为，我们过去三年的胜利成就，主要的是由于政府中的人英明能干，廉洁奉公。上面所说，也可以证明，这样的看法是肤浅的。只有为人民的利益积极奋斗的政党和政府，才能领导全体人民一起来完成这样伟大的业绩。
    上面所说，关于广大群众的积极性与创造性，已经可以消释一个怀疑。这个怀疑是：参加大工程及群众运动的群众，是不是被迫来的？以前社会中的政府，对于人民不是用威逼，就是用利诱，此外没有别的办法了。有些人用这种看法来看我们的群众运动，他们想：人数太多，利诱似乎是不可能，那一定是用威逼了。事实是威逼与积极性与创造性是不相容的。你可能威逼一个人作些照例的事情。你可以威逼一个人作些你命令他作的事情，但是，你不可威逼他发挥积极性与创造性。只有在自觉自愿的情形下，人才可能有积极性与创造性。
    在解放以前，有不少的人（包括我在内），现在世界上也还有不少的人，对于马克思列宁主义的唯物论的“物”字，望文生义，认为在共产党领导的社会内，大概是在“物质”方面进步，在“精神”方面堕落，有人耽心地问：中国向来有尊重道德的传统，现在是不是抛弃了。
    有一句成语说：“不怕不识货，就怕货比货。”我们三年来所发生的不计其数的新鲜的事情，充分地证明我们新民主主义的社会比以前的社会高。高不仅在人民经济生活方面，而是在各方面都提高。在道德方面的提高，尤其是特别显著。
    以前的人们所提出的道德理想，例如中国哲学家所提出的“兼相爱，交相利”，西洋哲学家所提出的“最大多数人底最大幸福”，宗教家所提出的“人人为我，我为人人”，都只是一个理想，对于绝大多数人们，是可望而不可即的；在我们社会里，我们底道德标准“全心全意为人民服务”，仅仅在三年之内，已成为普通人的实践的目标。在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军，每一个人都在不避一切的危险，自觉地为人民服务；在生产各部门的劳动模范，每一个人都在克服一切的困难，自觉地为人民服务。在三年之中，使社会上每一个人都在道德方面提高了，实现了中国以前书本中所常说到而永未实现过的“移风易俗”的盛事。若非在共产党领导的社会内，这也是不可能的。
    只有在共产党所建立的社会制度之下，才能使个人利益与社会利益相结合。在反动派所统治的社会里，所谓“社会利益”，主要的是反动派的利益。这是与人民的利益相冲突的。在解放前的社会中，提倡“人人为我，我为人人”，只是一句空话。在解放了的社会中，社会的利益，也就是个人的利益。人人都为人民服务，自己也在人民之中，这才真可能“人人为我，我为人人”。
    所以在我们的社会中，没有个人自由与社会组织相对立、相冲突的问题。因为在我们的社会里，个人的利益与社会的利益是分不开的。所以个人底自由与团体的自由也是分不开的。我们研究科学，为的是战胜自然，使人民在大自然面前得到自由，人民的自由，也就是每一个人的自由。我们抗美援朝，为的是从帝国主义的威胁下，保卫我们的祖国，使祖国得到自由。祖国的自由，也就是我们每一个人的自由。在反对帝国主义的斗争中，在与自然斗争中，我们必须组织起来，共同奋斗，组织越严密，得到的成功就越大。人生最大的愉快，在于一个人感觉到在这许多争取自由的工作中，他也贡献了他的一部分。越是站在人民最需要的地方，越是容易有这样的愉快。
    我们三年来的伟大的成就与辉煌的胜利，绝不是偶然的。这是共产党领导下的新的社会制度所必然有的结果。三年来的成就，使每一个人都认识到新的社会制度的优越性。有了这样的认识，他就了解了“进步”与“落后”的真实意义，他就一定愿意而且希望赶紧扔掉旧社会制度所给他的一切，与新社会合为一体。这样的过程，就是思想改造的过程。在思想改造底过程中，我们更觉到共产党的伟大。希腊哲学家柏拉图引用一个神话说：上帝是不忌妒的，所以他创造人，使之与他相似。在工人阶级还没有出现的时候，没有人愿意另外有人与他完全相似。老师教徒弟，总要留一两手，怕的是徒弟与他完全相似。但是工人阶级是不忌妒的，极其欢迎每个人都是工人阶级。它欢迎每一个人都在地位上思想上与它完全相似，为的是同心协力创造社会主义的社会，以达到人类最高的理想。
    以上是我对于我们底新社会的几点认识。我觉得我底认识还是很浅薄、可能还有错误。但是在过去三年中，每个人的进步那怕是很小的，也都是我们人民共和国的成就的一部分。“泰山不让土壤”，所以我也把它写出来，以为中华人民共和国三周年的纪念。
    照上面所说的，我们人民共和国的三年，在各方面都有了伟大的成就与辉煌的胜利。可是这只是我们的工作的开始的开始。我们所迫切需要的，是在和平的国际环境中，进行我们的建设，由新民主主义进入社会主义。这是中国人民的愿望，也是全世界人民的愿望。正当庆祝中华人民共和国成立三周年之际，亚洲及太平洋区域各国的人民代表们来到我们的首都，开和平会议。这个会议的成功，将使我们新社会的建设更多一个保证。这个会议是一定成功的，因为它是亚洲及太平洋区域人民所支持的，也是全世界人民所支持的。
