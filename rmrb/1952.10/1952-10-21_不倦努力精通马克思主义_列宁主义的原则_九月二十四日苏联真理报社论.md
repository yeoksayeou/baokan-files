The Communist Party follows the doctrine of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin throughout its activities. Marxism-Leninism enables the Party to orient itself in the environment, understand the internal connections of events around it, and implement correct policies in the struggle to build communism.

The great leaders and organizers of the Communist Party, Lenin and Stalin, always attached paramount importance to arming the Party's cause with revolutionary theory. Lenin pointed out that without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement. Only a party armed with advanced theory can fulfill the role of an advanced fighter.

Comrade Stalin taught that no conscious communist work is possible without the combination of practical work and theoretical knowledge. To work blindly, groping along - this will be the fate of practical workers if they do not study Leninism, do not strive to master Leninism, and do not hope to combine their practical work with necessary theoretical knowledge.

Comrade Stalin said at the 18th Party Congress: "The higher the political level and Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff in any department of state work and Party work, the higher the work itself, the more effective it is, and the more effective the results of the work; conversely, the lower the political level and Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff, the more delays and failures in the work, and the more the staff themselves will become short-sighted and degenerate into narrow-minded bureaucrats who only seek immediate interests, and the easier it is for them to degenerate and defect -- this is a theorem."

The most favorable conditions have been created in our country for all party members to systematically and deeply study Marxism-Leninism. Millions of Communist Party members adhere to studying Stalin's "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course." The complete works of Lenin and Stalin have become the property of the broad masses of Party members and the majority of Soviet intellectuals.

Party organizations at all levels have done a lot of work in carrying out Marxist-Leninist study through the Party's education system. However, the current level of Marxist-Leninist propaganda still fails to meet the high requirements put forward by the tasks of communist construction.

The draft revision of the Party Constitution points out that the main task of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union now is to establish a communist society through the gradual transition from socialism to communism, gradually raise the material and cultural level of society, educate social members with internationalism and the spirit of establishing fraternal relations with the working people of all countries, and extremely strengthen the socialist motherland's active defense against enemy aggression.

In order to strive to complete the main tasks facing the Party, all Party members are required to enhance their sense of responsibility for the Party's cause and enhance their vanguard role in the cause of communist construction. This can only be achieved on the basis of further improving the ideological and political level of Party members. This is the reason why the draft revision of the Party Constitution puts forward the following requirements as the obligation of every Party member:

"Strive to improve their class consciousness and master the principles of Marxism-Leninism."

Without theoretical cultivation and political training, Communist Party members cannot successfully realize their role as leaders of the masses, cannot correctly explain the content of the Party's policies and resolutions to non-Party masses, and cannot become fighters who actively struggle to implement the Party's resolutions. Caring about Party members' study of Marxist-Leninist theory is the most important responsibility of every Party organ and every Party grassroots organization.

At the Party representative meetings and Party congresses of various union republics that are currently being held, those Party organs that have not organized Party members to study Marxism-Leninism well have been justly criticized. For example, at the Omsk City Party Representative Meeting, it was pointed out that there were serious errors in the work of equipping the Party education network in the previous academic year. There is often a phenomenon of rote learning and pedantry in the teaching work of schools and study groups, and the materials learned are not all related to the tasks of communist construction. At the same time, it was also pointed out at the representative meeting that many leading cadres take an indifferent attitude towards improving their ideological level and do not engage in theoretical study.

In the Khabarovsk Krai Party organization, nearly five thousand Party members and candidate members did not participate in political study. In addition, about one thousand people dropped out of the Marxist-Leninist night universities for various reasons, and 490 political schools and groups did not complete their teaching plans.

At the Estonian Party Congress, the delegates also pointed out the great shortcomings in organizing Party members to study Marxism-Leninism. Here, the ideological level of the lectures in many study groups is very low. Due to the lack of supervision from the Party organs, some Party members have chosen self-study, which is actually just used to cover up their lack of study.

At the Odessa Oblast Party Representative Meeting, it was also pointed out that some leading cadres in the Party organization here use the excuse of heavy main work to not care about improving their theoretical knowledge. These people have obviously forgotten the fact that they cannot complete the tasks that leaders should complete without improving their ideological and theoretical level.

At many representative meetings, it was justly pointed out that many Party organizations have not seriously struggled to improve the teaching quality of the Party education system. Propagandists are often selected from personnel who do not have the necessary conditions to lead the courses. At the same time, the Party organs rarely help these propagandists enrich their knowledge and improve their skills.

All these shortcomings illustrate one problem: the organization of Marxist-Leninist propaganda work cannot yet meet the Party's requirements. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels must resolutely improve Marxist-Leninist propaganda work, organize political education for Party members and candidate members, and ensure supervision over their mastery of the minimum limit of Marxist-Leninist knowledge. Party committee secretaries and other leaders at all levels should personally pay attention to the issue of Party education for Party members and often care about selecting and cultivating mature propaganda cadres.

Studying Marxist-Leninist theory is the most important obligation of every Party member and candidate member. It is necessary to improve Party members' sense of responsibility for studying Marxist-Leninist theory and improving their awareness. To become a true communist and socio-political activist, one should study the laws of social development and be good at applying these laws to one's own practical work. The task of the Party's propaganda work is to arm our cadres and all Communist Party members with the science of Marxism-Leninism.

The new academic year of the Party education system is about to begin. Party organizations at all levels should use all means to make this year's study for Party members more organized and carry out the study at a higher ideological and theoretical level.

The mission of the entire Party education system is to cultivate fighters with firm ideas and high theoretical cultivation for the cause of the great Lenin-Stalin Party.

    不倦努力精通马克思主义—列宁主义的原则
    ——九月二十四日苏联真理报社论
    共产党在其整个活动中都遵循着马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的学说。马克思列宁主义使党能够在环境中确定方向，了解四周事变的内部联系并在争取建设共产主义的斗争中执行正确的政策。
    共产党的伟大领袖与组织者列宁和斯大林对于用革命理论武装党的事业经常给予头等重大的意义。列宁指出，没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。只有以先进理论武装起来的党，才能实现先进战士的作用。
    斯大林同志教导说，没有实际工作和理论知识的结合，任何自觉的共产主义工作都是不可能的。工作盲目，在摸索中工作——这将是实际工作者的命运，假若他们不学习列宁主义，不努力掌握列宁主义，假若他们不希望使自己的实际工作同必要的理论知识相结合的话。
    斯大林同志在第十八次党代表大会上说过：“在国家工作和党工作任何一个部门中，工作人员底政治水准和马克思列宁主义觉悟程度愈高，工作本身也愈高，愈有成效，工作底结果也愈有效力；反过来说，工作人员底政治水准和马克思列宁主义觉悟程度愈低，工作中的延误和失败也愈多，工作人员本身也会愈加变为鼠目寸光的小人，堕落成为一些只图眼前利益的事务主义者，而他们也就愈易蜕化变节，——这要算是一个定理”。
    在我国已为全体党员系统而深入地学习马克思列宁主义创设了最优越的条件。几百万共产党员坚持着学习斯大林的“联共（布）党史简明教程”。列宁和斯大林全集已成为广大党员群众和多数苏维埃知识分子干部的财产了。
    各级党组织在通过党的教育系统开展马克思列宁主义学习方面曾作了不少工作。然而马克思列宁主义宣传工作底现有水平，还仍然不能符合共产主义建设任务所提出的高度要求。
    党章修正草案中指出，现在苏联共产党的主要任务是：通过由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的途径来建立共产主义社会，逐步提高社会的物质和文化水平，用国际主义及与各国劳动人民建立兄弟联系的精神来教育社会成员，极度加强社会主义祖国对其敌人侵略的积极防御。
    为争取完成党所面临的主要任务，要求所有党员提高其对党的事业的责任感，提高他们在共产主义建设事业中的先锋作用。这一点只有在进一步提高党员的思想政治水平的基础上才能做到。这就是党章修正草案中提出下列要求作为每个党员的义务的原因：
    “努力提高自己的阶级觉悟，精通马克思主义—列宁主义的原则”。
    没有理论知识的修养和政治锻炼，共产党员便不能成功地实现其作为群众领导者的作用，便不能向非党群众正确地解释党的政策和决议底内容，也不能成为为实现党的决议而积极斗争的战士。关心党员对马克思列宁主义理论的学习，是每一个党机关，每一个党的基层组织的最重要的职责。
    在目前正举行的党代表会议及各加盟共和国的党代表大会上，那些没有很好地组织党员进行马克思列宁主义学习的党机关，都受到了公正的批评。比如，在奥木斯克市党代表会议上即已指出：在上一学年配备党教育网的工作中就存在着严重的错误。在学校和学习小组的教学工作中经常出现读死书和学究派的现象，所学的材料并不都是和共产主义建设任务相联系的。同时在代表会议上也指出，很多领导干部对提高自己的思想水平采取漠不关心的态度，他们不进行理论学习。
    在哈巴洛夫边疆区党组织中，几乎有五千个党员和候补党员没有参加政治学习。另外，约有一千人左右为各种原因退出了马克思列宁主义夜大学，有四百九十个政治学校和小组没有完成教学计划。
    在爱沙尼亚党代表大会上，代表们也指出组织党员进行马克思列宁主义学习中的巨大缺点。在这里许多学习小组中，课程讲授的思想水平很低。由于党机关方面缺乏监督，有些党员便选择了自学方式，实际上这只不过是用来掩饰他们的不学习。
    在敖得萨州的党代表会议上也指出，这里党组织中的某些领导干部，藉口主要工作繁重而不关心提高自己的理论知识。这些人显然是忘记了下面的事实：不提高自己的思想理论水平，便不能够完成领导人所应完成的任务。
    在许多代表会议上都公正地指出，有很多党组织没有认真地为提高党教育系统的教学质量而进行斗争。宣传员常常是从一些不具备领导功课应有条件的人员中选拔的。同时党机关又很少帮助这些宣传员充实知识，提高技巧。
    所有这些缺点都说明一个问题：马克思列宁主义宣传工作的组织尚不能符合党的要求。因此，各级党的组织必须坚决改进马克思列宁主义的宣传工作，组织对党员及候补党员的政治教育并保证对他们掌握最低限度的马克思列宁主义知识实行监督。各级党委书记和其他领导者应亲自关注对党员进行党的教育的问题，并经常关怀选择和培养成熟的宣传干部。
    学习马克思列宁主义理论，是每个党员及候补党员的最重要的义务。必须提高党员对学习马克思列宁主义理论及提高自己的觉悟程度底责任心。要成为一个真正的共产主义者和社会政治活动家，就应该学习社会发展的规律，并善于将这些规律应用到自己的实际工作中去。党的宣传工作底任务就在于以马克思列宁主义的科学来武装我们的干部和全体共产党员。
    党教育系统的新学年即将开始。各级党组织应当用一切办法使本年度党员的学习进行得更有组织，使学习在更高的思想理论水平上进行。
    整个党教育系统的使命，就是为伟大的列宁斯大林党的事业培养思想坚定，有高度理论修养的战士。
