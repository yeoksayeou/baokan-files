    The Glass Person
    By Otto Kunkel, Director of the German Hygiene Museum
    Editor's Note: When China and the German Democratic Republic signed a cultural cooperation agreement last October, the government of the German Democratic Republic presented the Central People's Government of China with a "Glass Person." This Glass Person has now arrived in Beijing and is on display at the "Exhibition of Glass Human Body Models and Introduction to German Pictures" (located in the waterside pavilion of Zhongshan Park, Beijing). The following is an article by Otto Kunkel, director of the German Hygiene Museum in Dresden, introducing the history of the "Glass Person."

    Millions of people at home and abroad have already seen the "Glass Woman" or the "Glass Man" and have been able to see the structure of the human body, the function of internal organs, and the location of blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves from this "person" made of a glass-like transparent material (Cellon). With the help of audio tapes, the mysteries of the human body can be explained to each audience member.

    However, few people know the history and current production of the "Glass Person." In recent years, the German Democratic Republic has developed rapidly in all aspects, and this production is no exception. Thanks to the creative spirit of our country's advanced intellectuals and activists, technology has been improved, the manufacturing process has been simplified, and working hours have been shortened in this area.

        The First "Glass Person"
    The first "Glass Person" was exhibited at the Second International Hygiene Exhibition in Dresden in 1930, and it took eighteen months to manufacture. He couldn't "speak," and only individual organs in his body could light up. By 1945, only five "Glass Men," one "Glass Woman," and one "Glass Pregnant Woman" had been made. The manufacturing time still took more than a year.

    The fate of several "Glass People" made at that time is very interesting.

    One "Glass Man" was sold to Japan, another to the United States, and another was exhibited at the Paris World Exhibition and then transferred to Barcelona. After World War II, he was illegally detained there by Spanish fascists and has not been returned to this day.

    The fourth "Glass Man" traveled throughout western Germany with a mobile exhibition during World War II, and because of the division of our motherland, he still cannot return.

    The fifth "Glass Man," like the "Glass Pregnant Woman" model, was a victim of the American bombing of Dresden; because even the German Hygiene Museum was severely damaged in that bombing crime. Another "Glass Woman" was sold to a women's underwear factory in the United States for use as a model. When brave people restarted construction after the collapse of fascist Germany, the German Hygiene Museum restarted manufacturing

    "Glass People."

    Nothing was left! New workshops had to be built, new molds had to be cast, and new tools had to be manufactured. The pioneering heroes did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties.

        Mass Production Makes It Possible for "Glass People" to Travel the World
        Production could begin between 1947 and 1948. But now a new spirit is shown, people no longer work in the old ways, and every action is considered and checked. The previous price of 50,000 marks was too expensive, and it could only be reduced through mass production and increased labor productivity.

    The research of our country's intellectuals and activists has achieved its goal: now buying a "Glass Person" only costs 23,000 marks.

    Four "Glass Women" were made in 1951, and four "Glass Women" and two "Glass Men" are planned to be made in 1952. If only seven "Glass People" were made in the fifteen years up to 1945, then nine "Glass People" have left our factory in the three years since 1949. A pair of "Glass Couple" have been presented by the government of Saxony to Marshal Stalin as a gift for his 70th birthday, and another pair of "Glass Couple" have been bought by the Soviet Union.

        A "Glass Woman" was sold to Warsaw, and another traveled a long way to Beijing. Two "Glass Women" are being exhibited on tour in the German Democratic Republic with mobile exhibitions, one of which is accompanying the famous "Women" exhibition arranged in the mobile display pavilion, which has been to about thirty-five cities and has had over 700,000 visitors. Another "Glass Woman" is traveling with the exhibition of the Information Bureau of the German Democratic Republic. Another "Glass Woman" will be exhibited at the large industrial exhibition in Bucharest.

        Some Interesting Facts About Manufacturing
    In the past, a double mold had to be used to cast transparent skin, and a lot of physical strength was required. Now, the skin is made using a vacuum device that sucks the heated and softened Cellon into the mold, minimizing the need for physical strength.

    In the past, the skin of a "Glass Woman" required forty-nine parts, but now it only requires twenty-six. As mentioned earlier, the internal organs of the human body can reflect light so that the audience can see them. A total of twenty-three internal organs can be seen, which requires fifty-one small lights. In the past, sixty-two molds were needed to make internal organs, but now only forty are needed. The human skeleton is the same size as a real person, but unlike real bones, which have two hundred and twenty-three parts, it only has seventy-nine parts, and it is made of lead. The vascular and nervous systems are woven from copper wire 0.2 mm thick, the same thickness as the real thing, and a total of 18,000 meters of copper wire are needed. A "Glass Man" weighs sixty-one pounds and is 1.76 meters tall; a "Glass Woman" weighs fifty-eight pounds and is 1.66 meters tall. In addition, the "Glass Person" can explain the structure of the human body in ten different languages. For example, the "Glass Woman" exhibited this time can explain in Chinese.

    The work of manufacturing the "Glass Person" is also part of the overall task of the German Hygiene Museum, which is to popularize health and human body knowledge to all working people so that everyone understands anatomy.

    What the inside of the human body looks like is not only important for doctors to know, but also extremely important for laymen.

    玻璃做的人
    德国卫生博物馆馆长  奥托·孔克尔
    编者按：去年十月我国与德意志民主共和国签订文化合作协定时，德意志民主共和国政府送给我国中央人民政府一个“玻璃人”。这个玻璃人现已运抵北京，展出在“玻璃人体模型及介绍德国图片展览会”上（地点在北京中山公园水榭）。下面是德累斯登德国卫生博物馆馆长奥托·孔克尔的一篇介绍“玻璃人”历史的文章。
    在国内和国外已经有成百万人看见过“玻璃女人”或“玻璃男人”，并且能够从这个用一种像玻璃一样透明的材料（赛珑）所制成的“人”身上看到人体的构造、内脏的机能，以及血管、淋巴管和神经的位置。且通过录音带的帮助，可以向每个观众解释人体的奥妙之处。
    但是迄今还很少有人知道“玻璃人”的历史和目前的生产情况。最近几年来民主德国在各方面飞跃发展，在这一种生产方面也没有例外。由于我国先进知识分子和积极分子的创造精神，在这方面也改进了技术，简化了制造过程，因而缩短了工作时间。
        第一个“玻璃人”
    一九三○年德累斯登第二次国际卫生展览会上展出了第一个“玻璃人”，当时用了十八个月之久才制造成功。他不会“说话”，身体中只有个别的器官可以发光。到一九四五年为止一共才制成了五个“玻璃男人”、一个“玻璃女人”和一个“玻璃孕妇”。制造时间仍然需要一年以上。
    当时制成的几个“玻璃人”的命运是很有趣的。
    一个“玻璃男人”卖给了日本，另一个卖给了美国，另外一个在巴黎世界展览会展出后转到了巴塞罗纳，第二次世界大战结束后被西班牙的法西斯分子非法的扣留在那里，直到今天还没有交出来。
    第四个“玻璃男人”在第二次大战时随同一个流动展览会在德国西部各处旅行，因为我们祖国的分裂直到现在还不能回来。
    第五个“玻璃男人”和“玻璃孕妇”的模型一样，作了美国滥炸德累斯登时的牺牲品了；因为连德国卫生博物馆也在那次滥炸的罪行下毁坏得很厉害。另一个“玻璃女人”卖给美国一个妇女内衣工厂作模特儿用了。当法西斯德国崩溃后勇敢的人们重新开始建设时，德国卫生博物馆又重新开始制造
    “玻璃人”。
    什么也没有了！新的工作室必须建筑起来，新的模子必须铸造起来，新的工具必须制造起来。开天辟地的英雄们没有在困难面前低头。
        大批制造使“玻璃人”周游世界成为可能
        一九四七——一九四八年间已经可以开始生产了。可是现在显示出一种新的精神，人们不再用旧的方法去进行工作，每一个动作都经过考虑和检查。以前售价五万马克太贵了，只有通过大批制造和提高劳动生产率才能减低。
    我国知识分子和积极分子的钻研达到了目的：现在买一个“玻璃人”只要二万三千马克了。
    一九五一年制成了四个“玻璃女人”，一九五二年准备制造四个“玻璃女人”和两个“玻璃男人”。如果说，到一九四五年为止的十五年内只制造了七个“玻璃人”，那么从一九四九年以来的三年之中已经有九个“玻璃人”离开了我们的工厂。一对“玻璃夫妇”已由萨克森州政府赠送给斯大林大元帅作为七十岁诞辰的寿礼，还有一对“玻璃夫妇”已由苏联买去了。
        一个“玻璃女人”卖给了华沙，另外一个经过漫长的旅途到达了北京。两个“玻璃女人”正随着流动展览会在德意志民主共和国境内巡回展出，其中一个随同布置在活动大陈列亭内的著名的“妇女”展览会，已经到过大约三十五个城市，观众七十余万，另外的一个“玻璃女人”正在随同德意志民主共和国情报局的展览会旅行。还有一个“玻璃女人”将在布加勒斯特大型工业展览会上展出。
        关于制造的几点趣事
    从前铸造透明皮肤时须用一个双重模子，而且必须用很大的体力。现在制造皮肤时用一种真空设备，将加热后软化了的赛珑吸入模子内，这样使体力的需要减到最低的限度。
    从前一个“玻璃女人”的皮肤需要四十九件零件，现在只需二十六件。前面已经提过，人体的内脏可以反光，使观众可以看见。这样一共可以看到二十三个内脏，为此就需要用五十一盏小灯。以前制造内脏需用六十二个模子，现在只需四十个。人型的骨骼和真人一般大小，但不像真骨骼那样有二百二十三个部分，而只有七十九个部分，它是用铅作的。血管和神经系是用○·二公厘粗的铜丝编成的，和真的一样粗，一共需用一万八千公尺铜丝。一个“玻璃男人”重六十一磅，高一·七六公尺；一个“玻璃女人”重五十八磅，高一·六六公尺。此外，“玻璃人”可以用十种不同的语言来说明人体的构造。例如这次展出的“玻璃女人”就能用中文解说。
    制造“玻璃人”的工作也就是德国卫生博物馆总任务的一部分，这个总任务就是：向全体劳动人民普及健康和人体知识，使大家都懂得解剖学。
    人体内部是什么样子，不仅医生应该知道，对于外行的人也是极为重要的。
