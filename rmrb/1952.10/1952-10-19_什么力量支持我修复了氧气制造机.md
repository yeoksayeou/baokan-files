What Power Supported Me in Repairing the Oxygen Generator

Northwest Railway Main Line Engineering Bureau, Internal Combustion Engine Repair Shop Engineer, Zhu Yongkang

I am a mechanical engineer. In the first half of this year, with the support of the leadership and the help of my comrades, we repaired the only oxygen generator in the Northwest. It started producing oxygen in July.

The oxygen generator is a very complex and large machine. A lot of oxygen is needed in railway engineering. In the past, the Northwest Railway Main Line Engineering Bureau purchased oxygen from Shanghai and Tianjin, which was not only costly but also dangerous due to long-distance transportation. Under these circumstances, the Northwest Railway Main Line Engineering Bureau decided to repair a dilapidated oxygen generator it had received. Last November, Zhang Xueru, the director of the design department, gave me this task. When he assigned me this task, Director Zhang explained in detail the importance of this machine to the construction of the Northwest and asked the Ministry of Railways to write me a letter of introduction to understand the manufacturing and spare parts situation in Shanghai. When making the budget, I divided it into three phases: repair, production, and improvement. After submitting it for approval, it was approved in just three days. This couldn't help but make me think of the fate of a budget I made during the Kuomintang's rule. At that time, I proposed a suggestion to install a cylindrical wire screen behind the stone crushing machine to speed up the stone screening process. The person in charge asked me to make a budget. I made it according to the actual required figures, but he approved it at a 30% discount. It turned out that he thought I had used my brains in order to profit from it. He thought: "Otherwise, why would you spend your brains on this!" I was so angry that I had to abandon this suggestion.

On July 1st of this year, when we started trial production of oxygen, the purity of the oxygen produced was only 50% due to air leakage, which was completely unusable. At that time, some comrades felt discouraged. Some comrades, fearing the waste of gasoline, suggested turning off the machine. But I thought that if we didn't find the cause while the machine was running, there would be no way to fix it if we turned it off; and it would be even more wasteful to start the test again. So I asked Director Tang to continue running the machine for a while to find the cause. Director Tang immediately supported my proposal. Later, we found that the cause of the air leak was that the screws were too loose. When Director Tang heard this, he immediately said, "Go make a screw!" I said, "I'm afraid there isn't enough time!" Director Tang ran out in three steps and brought back a new screw in fifteen minutes. We replaced it immediately, eliminating the air leak. Forty-five minutes later, the oxygen purity rose, from 70 degrees to 98.7 degrees. The leaders' kind support allowed our technology to be fully utilized to serve the railway construction of the motherland. Could we have gotten this during the Kuomintang era? Absolutely not. In those days, encountering such a situation would only have brought ridicule and blame.

On June 24th of this year, I was careless when mixing medicines, which caused me to lose my sight immediately. During the treatment period, Section Chief Xia of the Mechanical Department and Director Tang personally visited me in the hospital to express their concern. The coordinator also sent someone to inquire about my condition. My capable assistant, the young worker Wang Zhaoyun, came to see me several times a day. This made me very touched. Before my eyes were completely healed, I decided to leave the hospital and go back to work, despite the doctor's advice.

Where did I get this energy from?

I once went abroad to resist the US and aid Korea, and I personally witnessed the enemy's brutality. I realized the greatness and loveliness of the motherland even more. Every Korean people would tell us the stories of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army bravely fighting the enemy with excitement. Once, our soldiers were digging up a time bomb. They had just dug up half of it when the superiors ordered them to go to eat. Just as they left, the bomb exploded. But our soldiers didn't think of that terrible "what if". They just smiled calmly: "Ah! It exploded! Let's dig another one!" What were these heroic soldiers fighting for? Wasn't it to protect the construction cause of our motherland? After returning to the construction post of the motherland, their heroic spirit became my strength. I thought: if I don't work hard, I will be sorry for those who dig up time bombs. This is also the reason why I was able to firmly work for the repair of this machine. For example, when making the rubber bag for this machine, I went to Shanghai. I don't know how many factories I ran to, and they all said they couldn't make it. Finally, at the Dacheng Rubber Factory, I explained the importance of the oxygen generator to the construction of the Northwest. The engineer of this factory agreed to give it a try. After many experiments, a rubber formulation that was resistant to oxidation was successfully developed. I was so happy that I wanted to jump up, but immediately the problem of the steaming tank came up again. Where could we find such a big steaming tank? We used our brains, thought of ways, and racked our brains, but it still didn't work. The engineer of this factory announced that he was helpless. At this time, I suggested that he call the workers to talk. At that time, he didn't think much of it. He asked me: "When problems occur in the production of your factory, do the workers ask you? Or do you ask the workers?" I replied: "In the past, the workers asked me; now the workers ask me, and I also ask the workers." He finally reluctantly accepted my suggestion. So, we gathered the workers together for a discussion. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, the workers' consciousness improved. In order to build the Northwest of the motherland, the workers used their brains and overcame the difficulty of not having a steaming tank: We used a very large cement room in the factory, blocked the doors and windows, and used it as a steaming tank. The first huge rubber bag on the oxygen machine was made in New China. Why did I think of asking the workers? Because I firmly remembered the truth that the Party often taught me: technicians must combine with the working masses to exert infinite power.

The leadership gave me a great reward for this achievement of repairing the oxygen generator, and also held a conference. I had never received this before. During the Kuomintang era, I had also put forward many rationalization proposals. During the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Road and the construction of the Nanjing to Tangshan high-grade asphalt road, the construction period was shortened due to my suggestions, but all I got was blows and dismissal. At that time, I sighed that I had taken the wrong path and my life was over. Today, when I think of the dark ages of the past, how can I not be excited! How can I not feel boundless happiness!

    什么力量支持我修复了氧气制造机
    西北铁路干线工程局  内燃机修配厂工程师  朱永康
    我是一个机械工程人员。今年上半年，在上级的支持和同志们的帮助下，我们修好了西北仅有的一部氧气制造机，从七月份起开始出氧了。
    氧气制造机是一个很复杂和庞大的机器。在铁道工程中要用很多氧气。过去西北铁路干线工程局从上海、天津购买氧气，不但成本高，而且由于长途运输，容易发生危险。在这种情况下，西北铁路干线工程局决定把接收的一部破烂氧气制造机修复。去年十一月，设计处张学儒处长把这个任务交给我。在交给我这个任务时，张处长详细说明这个机器对于西北建设的重要性，并请铁道部给我写了介绍信，以便到上海去了解制造配件情况。在做预算时，我分作修复、生产、改进三期编制，送请批审后，仅三天就批下。这不禁使我想到在国民党统治时期我编造的一个预算的命运。那时我曾提出一个建议，主张在轧石机后装一圆筒形钢丝筛，以加速筛石速度。主管人让我编造预算，我依照实需数字做了，但他却批了按七折发给。原来他以为我动了脑筋，必定是为了从中取利。他认为：“不然，你为什么要花这个脑筋呢！”我气极了，只好放弃这个建议。
    今年七月一日，开始试制氧气时，因为漏气，制出来的氧气纯度只有百分之五十，根本不能使用。当时有些同志心里冷了半截。有的同志怕浪费汽油，就说把车关了吧。但我想到，假若不在开车时找出原因来，关了车就更没办法了；而且再开车试验就更浪费。所以我请求汤厂长再继续开一会车以找出原因。汤厂长立即支持了我的主张。后来我们发现漏气的原因是螺丝太松。汤厂长听到了，马上就说：“去车一个螺丝吧！”我说：“怕时间来不及！”汤厂长三步并作两步地跑了出去，十五分钟后，拿回一个新的螺丝来。我们立刻换上，消灭了漏气的现象；四十五分钟后，氧气纯度上升了，由七十度，直到九十八度七。领导同志这样亲切地支持，使我们的技术能够很好发挥，为祖国的铁路建设服务。在国民党时，能够得到吗？绝对不能够。在那时候遇到这样的情况，只会得到讥笑和责备。
    今年六月二十四日，我因为配药品时麻痹大意，使两眼立刻失明。在诊治期间，机械处夏处长和汤厂长都亲自到医院慰问我。协理员也派人询问病情。我的有力助手青年工人王兆云，一天几趟跑来看我。这都使我非常感动。在我的眼睛还没有完全好的时候，我不顾医生的劝阻，就决定出院工作。
    我那里来的这股劲呢？
    我曾经出国抗美援朝，亲眼看见敌人的残暴，更加体会祖国的伟大可爱。每一个朝鲜人民，都会用激动的心情，向我们述说中国人民志愿军英勇杀敌的故事。有一次我们的战士在挖掘定时炸弹，刚挖了一半，上级命令他们去吃饭，就在他们离开的一刹那，炸弹爆炸了，可是我们的战士，并不想到那种可怕的“万一”，他们却很坦然地笑一笑：“啊！爆炸了！再挖一个去！”这些英勇的战士，他们为了什么？还不是为了保卫我们祖国的建设事业吗？回到祖国的建设岗位以后，他们的英勇精神，就变成了我的力量。我想：要不好好工作，就对不起那些挖掘定时炸弹的人。这也就是我能够坚定地为修复这部机器而奔走的原因。譬如做这部机器的胶橡袋，我到上海，不知跑了多少家工厂，他们都说不能制，最后到大成橡胶厂，我解说氧气制造机对西北建设的重要性。这个厂的工程师同意试试看。经过多次的试验，不怕氧化的橡胶配制成功了，那时我喜得真要跳起了，但是，马上蒸缸的问题又来了，从那里去找那样大的蒸缸呀？我们便动脑筋，想办法，绞尽了脑汁还是行不通，这个厂的工程师宣布他已毫无办法，这时我建议他召集工人谈谈，当时他很不以为然，他反问我：“你们厂里生产中出了问题，是工人问你呢？还是你问工人呢？”我回答他：“以前是工人问我；现在是工人问我，我也问工人”，他总算勉强接受了我的建议。于是，我们便一起召集工人座谈。“三反”、“五反”后，工人的觉悟提高了，为着建设祖国的西北，工人们开动了脑筋，克服了没有蒸缸的困难：我们用该厂一个很大的水泥房间，堵住了门窗，当作蒸缸。氧气机上的第一条巨大的橡胶袋在新中国制出来了。为什么我会想到问问工人同志呢？因为我牢记了党经常教导我的，技术人员必须与工人群众相结合，才能发挥无穷的力量的真理。
    仅仅由于这一点修复氧气制造机的成绩，上级却给了我很大的奖励，还召开了大会。这是我从前没有受到过的。在国民党时期，我也曾提出过好多次合理化建议。在修滇缅路中，在修京汤（南京到汤山）高级柏油路中，都曾因我的建议而缩短了工期，但是我得到的只是打击、遣散，那时我自叹走错了路，一生完了。今天，想想过去了的黑暗年代，怎能不兴奋！怎能不感到无比的幸福呢！
