    Our Recuperation Life
    Volunteer Army Recuperator Peng Zhengbo
    I am a Volunteer Army recuperator recuperating in a hospital somewhere in the motherland. I know that the elders, brothers, sisters, and comrades-in-arms on the Korean front are all very concerned about us. Now, let me write a little about our life in the hospital to tell you.
    Our hospital is in a not-very-large county town, not far from the main street, but we can't hear the noisy sounds of the city. The hospital grounds are very spacious, with beautiful gardens and green vegetable plots. The wards are tall and bright buildings. Clean floors, shiny walls. The rooms are furnished with brand-new furniture of the same style.
    After we were admitted to the hospital, the leaders of the hospital and all the medical staff treated us like their own flesh and blood. The doctors examined us carefully, again and again; especially when surgery was required, there were thorough discussions and studies beforehand, so there were very few dangers. They took care of us and checked our wards day and night, sometimes staying up all night; they were simply exchanging their own thinness for our health. One doctor, when learning an advanced treatment method, first experimented with her own body. This made her sick for more than two weeks and at one point became very dangerous, but her experiment was successful, and later she used this new method to rescue many of our comrades. The superiors praised her, and all the wounded and sick in our hospital jointly made a silk banner to give to her. The nurses in the hospital loved us like our own younger sisters. They are young, have few staff, and are also studying culture, so they are very busy every day. Sometimes, our lightly wounded comrades really wanted to step in and help them with some work, but every time they were declined. No matter how tired they are, they insist that we rest.
    Our nutrition is the best it could be. Every day it's all rice, white flour, pork, beef, chicken, fish, eggs, and all kinds of fresh vegetables. There are also milk, biscuits, white sugar, lotus root powder, etc. for snacks. Some of the hospital chefs are hired from large restaurants, and some are selected from the army as cooking experts. They really have some skills, and the dishes they make taste really good!
    We have a club in our hospital, displaying various books, newspapers, and magazines. There are ball courts and ping-pong tables in the hospital, as well as carom billiards. As long as a comrade's body is able to move, there is a sport suitable for him. For comrades who cannot exercise, playing cards and chess pieces (Chinese chess, military chess, checkers, all available) are distributed to the wards. Some of us who are lightly wounded and are about to recover, in addition to diagnosis, medicine, and meals, often sit together in groups of three or five, sitting on the bed, or around in the shade of a tree, or beside the small stone table in the garden, playing to our heart's content, laughing, and singing.
    We have created several beautifully titled and content-rich blackboards, reflecting the activities of all the staff in the hospital. The deeds of some model doctors and model nurses have become good materials for us to practice writing and improve our culture.
    On holidays, we also rehearse dramas and songs and dances, with gongs and drums beating, and everyone is in high spirits, without any sign of being sick.
    In order to take care of our health, the superiors do not ask us to participate in cultural studies. However, many lightly wounded comrades, under the principle of not hindering recuperation, have voluntarily organized mutual aid learning groups, asking comrades with higher levels of education in the ward to be teachers. One comrade, Zeng Dongshan, learned more than two thousand Chinese characters in two weeks using the accelerated literacy method. He said: "Study hard! Don't waste these precious times. If you recover from your illness and learn culture, you will be able to better master military science and technology and kill more enemies when you return to the front lines."
    During the recuperation period, because the people of the motherland take care of us so well, our injuries and illnesses are healing very quickly. We only hope to recover soon, return to the front lines, and respond to the care of the people of the motherland by killing enemies and making meritorious contributions.

    我们的疗养生活
    志愿军休养员　彭政波
    我是在祖国某地医院里疗养的志愿军休养员。我知道全国的父老兄弟姊妹和朝鲜前线的战友都非常关怀我们。现在，我把我们病院里的生活情况写一点告诉大家吧。
    我们的医院在一个不很大的县城里，离大街不远，但是听不到市上嘈杂喧闹的声音。医院地面很宽敞，有美丽的花园和绿油油的菜圃。病房是高大明亮的楼房。干净的地板，发光的墙壁。室内配置着一色崭新的家具。
    我们入院以后，医院的首长和全院的医务工作同志们，都像对待自己的骨肉亲人一样对待我们。医生们给我们看病，总是三番五次地细心检查；尤其是要动手术时，事先都有周密的讨论研究，所以很少发生过危险。他们不分昼夜来给我们看病、查病房，有时连夜不睡，他们简直是拿自己的消瘦来换取我们的健康。有一位医生，在学习一种先进的治疗方法的时候，她首先用自己的身体作实验。这使她自己病了两个多星期，而且一度变得很危险，可是她的实验成功了，以后用这种新的方法抢救了我们好些同志。上级表扬了她，我们全院的伤病员联合做了一面锦旗赠给她。医院里的护士们，都像我们的亲妹妹一样爱护我们。她们年纪小，人手少，又在学文化，每天忙得很。有时，我们轻伤的同志真想插上手帮她们做一点工作，可是每一次都被她们谢绝了。她们无论自己怎样累，也要强迫我们休息。
    我们的营养最好不过了。每天尽是大米、白面、猪肉、牛肉、鸡、鱼、鸡蛋和各种新鲜蔬菜。还有牛奶、饼干、白糖、藕粉等做点心。医院的厨师有的是从大菜馆里聘来的，有的是从部队里挑选出来的做菜能手。他们真有几下子，做的菜味道真好！
    我们医院里有俱乐部，陈列着各种书报和杂志。院内有球场，乒乓球台，还有康乐球，只要身体能够运动的同志，都有适合他的运动。对于不能运动的同志，有扑克、棋子（象棋、军棋、跳棋，样样俱全）发到病房里来。我们一些伤病较轻的和快要痊愈了的同志，每天除了诊断、吃药、进餐以外，常常是三五个在一起，坐在床上，或围在树荫底下，或在花园的小石桌旁边，尽情地玩着，欢笑着，歌唱着。
    我们创办了几个刊头美丽、内容充实的黑板报，反映全院人员的活动情况。一些模范医生、模范护士的事迹，就成了我们练习写稿、提高文化的好材料。
    一到节日，我们还排演话剧和歌舞，锣鼓喧天，大家兴高彩烈，一点也不带病人气色。
    上级为了照顾我们的身体，不叫我们参加文化学习。但是，有不少轻伤员同志，在不妨碍休养的原则下，自动组织起互助学习小组，请病室内文化程度比较高的同志做老师。有一位曾东山同志，在两星期中用速成识字法学习，学会了两千多个生字。他说：“加油学啊！不要白费这些宝贵的时间。养好了病又学了文化，回到前线就能更好地掌握军事科学技术，多杀敌人。”
    在休养期中，因为祖国人民照顾得十分周到，我们的伤病好得很快。我们只盼着早日痊愈，重返前线，用杀敌立功来回答祖国人民的关怀。
