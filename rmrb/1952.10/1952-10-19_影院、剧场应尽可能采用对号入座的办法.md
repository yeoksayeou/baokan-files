    Movie Theaters and Theaters Should Adopt Assigned Seating Wherever Possible
    Editor: The "Beijing Municipal Education Trade Union Fifth District Working Committee" sponsored a "Peking Opera Performance Evening" at the Concert Hall on September 1st, scheduled to begin at 7:00 PM. Because there were no assigned seats, the audience began lining up outside the venue before 5:00 PM. Within half an hour, rows of four became two rows, or eight people per row, stretching for ten to twenty *zhang* (approx. 33-66 meters). The crowd grew larger and larger. When the doors opened at a little past 6:00 PM, everyone rushed in, disregarding the order of the line. The elderly, weak, women, and children were squeezed and cried out. This situation is not unique to the Concert Hall that evening; it is similar in other movie theaters and theaters without assigned seating. This is a great waste of people's time and energy. The purpose of the trade union holding the evening event was to entertain the teaching staff, but instead, they first had to stand in line and push their way into the venue. I believe this situation exists in more than one theater, so I hope this can be published to draw attention and find a way to correct it.

### 影院、剧场应尽可能采用对号入座的办法

    影院、剧场应尽可能采用对号入座的办法
    编辑同志：九月一日“北京市教育工会五区工作委员会”在音乐堂主办“京剧演出晚会”，定七时开演，由于不是对号入座，观众不到五时即在场外站队等候。半小时内，四人一排成为二行，即八人一排，长达一二十丈。以后愈来愈多。到六点多钟的时候，场门一开，大家争先恐后不按站队次序入场，老弱妇孺被挤喊叫。这种情形不仅那天晚上音乐堂如此，其他凡不对号入座的影院、剧场，也都类似，这对人民的时间和精力是极大的浪费。工会举办晚会的目的，是让教职员工娱乐，结果先让他们站队和争先恐后地拥挤入场。恐怕不止一个剧院有这种情形，所以希望发表，引起注意，设法改正。
