Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Presidium:

The Indian delegation is deeply disturbed by the news of the U.S. negotiating representatives' withdrawal from the Panmunjom armistice talks on October 8 and their unilateral declaration of an indefinite adjournment. The U.S. representatives are demanding that negotiations be resumed only after their unreasonable and unjust conditions have been accepted, conditions which are destined to keep large numbers of prisoners of war in their death camps.

On the same day, the Korean and Chinese negotiating representatives once again put forward a new proposal of great significance to facilitate an early agreement in accordance with the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War.

The American generals rejected this generous proposal, withdrew from the meeting, and took steps that amounted to breaking off the armistice negotiations. Subsequently, they carried out provocative bombings in the armistice zone, attempting to bring the negotiations to an irrevocable end.

India cannot but feel deeply concerned about this action. The armistice negotiations must be resumed so that the door to reaching a just armistice agreement is not closed.

The pressure of public opinion forced the negotiations to begin, and it can and must keep the negotiations going.

Those of us bear a special responsibility for this matter, because our governments initially approved the American intervention in Korea by complying with the United Nations resolution of June 27, 1950. We must never forget that the U.S. military command is carrying out its barbaric atrocities in the name of all our countries; even today, it is in our name that the armistice negotiations are being broken off.

The Indian delegation is immediately sending a telegram to the Indian government, urging it to firmly advocate the rapid resumption of armistice negotiations and to resolve the issue of exchanging prisoners of war on the basis of international law and in accordance with the points of agreement already reached in the negotiations.

We also urge the Indian government once again to completely sever ties with all atrocities being committed in Korea and with the continuous acts of sabotage against the armistice negotiations.

At this moment, the Indian Peace Organization has launched a movement demanding peace in Korea on the basis of international law. We firmly believe that we will be able to win over the vast majority of our people to support our just demands, thereby enabling India to play its effective role in stopping the Korean War.

### 印度代表团团长克其鲁关于朝鲜问题的发言

    印度代表团团长克其鲁关于朝鲜问题的发言主席先生，主席团的各位先生：
    印度代表团听到了十月八日美国谈判代表退出板门店的停战谈判并片面宣布无限期休会的消息后，深深地感到不安。美国代表要求在接受了他们无理和不公正的条件后才肯恢复谈判，而这些条件注定大批战俘要继续留在他们的死亡营里。
    在同一天，朝鲜和中国的谈判代表再一次地提出了一个有重大意义的新建议，以促使早日达成符合日内瓦战俘公约的协议。
    美国将军们拒绝了这个大度的建议，退出了会场，并采取了几乎等于使停战谈判破裂的步骤。随着，他们又在停战区进行挑衅性轰炸，力图使谈判无可挽回地结束下来。
    印度对此行动不能不深切地感到忧虑。停战谈判必须恢复，以使达成公正停战协定之门不致关闭。
    舆论的压力曾迫使谈判开始，现在能够而且必须使谈判继续进行。
    我们这些人对于这件事负有特别的责任，由于我们各国的政府当初遵守了一九五○年六月二十七日的联合国决议因而也就批准了美国对朝鲜的干涉。我们永远不能忘记，美军司令部是以我们所有国家的名义在进行着它的野蛮暴行的；就是在今天，还是以我们的名义，使停战谈判破裂。
    印度代表团正立即致电印度政府，促其坚决主张迅速恢复停战谈判，并在国际法的基础上和根据谈判中所已经取得的几点协议来解决交换战俘的问题。
    我们也再度敦促印度政府与在朝鲜所进行的一切暴行，以及对停战谈判的不断破坏行为完全割断关系。
    此刻，印度和平组织已发起一个运动，要求在国际法的基础上取得朝鲜的和平。我们深信，我们将能够把我们绝大部分人民争取过来支持我们的正义要求，从而使印度在制止朝鲜战争的问题上能够起其有效的作用。                （新华社）
