Comrade Gao Gang's instructions:
Comrade Zhao Dezun, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, and Comrade Yu Yifu, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, and Comrade Ren Guodong, Secretary of the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee, have summarized the new experiences of Zhaoyuan County's patriotic agricultural production increase campaign this year, which raises an extremely important issue for the leading organs and cadres in charge of rural work in our provinces, counties, and districts. According to the report of the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee, this county extensively promoted the planting method of "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection" this year, and applied topdressing fertilizer in a timely manner, resulting in nearly 10,000 hectares of high-yield and high-production fields throughout the county. On these nearly 10,000 hectares of high-yield fields, the average yield per hectare may increase by one to two times. Zhaoyuan County's experience shows that the potential for agricultural production in Northeast China is enormous. As long as we can value the advanced experiences of the masses of peasants, and study and summarize them according to agricultural science methods, and then promote them, we can gradually unleash the potential in agriculture, thereby greatly increasing the yield per unit area. Zhaoyuan County's experience has several new noteworthy characteristics: First, they have achieved rational management and increased grain production on large tracts of land, so the county's high-yield campaign can become a mass movement, gaining enthusiastic support from the masses. The "high-yield fields" promoted and implemented in some provinces and counties have created some experiences in high-yield, but because these experiences lack summarization, especially promotion, they only remain on a small piece of land, and some even disregard costs, so they have never become a mass high-yield movement. These places should learn from Zhaoyuan's experience. Second, the promotion of their advanced high-yield experience is based on the further development of the cooperative and mutual aid movement. Without the emergence of a large number of cooperative and mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, it would be impossible for the high-yield campaign to become a mass movement; and the promotion of advanced high-yield experience has enriched the content of the cooperative and mutual aid movement and promoted its development. Therefore, the promotion of advanced high-yield experience should be closely integrated with the further development and improvement of the cooperative and mutual aid movement. Third, their yield increase methods only require improvements on the old farming foundation to increase the yield per unit area by one to two times, which means that if new-style animal-drawn farm tools are used to fundamentally reform farming methods, and the old and new agricultural technologies are combined, the increase in production will be even greater. Therefore, in the future, we should continue to value the summarization and promotion of the good experiences inherent in the peasants, and at the same time, we should pay great attention to the promotion of animal-drawn farm tools and new farming methods and agricultural science and technology.

Comrades of all provinces, counties, and districts should carefully study Zhaoyuan County's leadership methods, and after the autumn harvest this year, summarize the experiences of the patriotic production increase campaign in your own province, county, and district, especially the advanced experiences of high-yield suitable for local conditions, and then convene activists from agricultural production cooperatives and various types of production cooperative mutual aid groups to discuss, so as to propose plans for each agricultural production cooperative and each production cooperative mutual aid group to increase production next year and methods for realizing the plans based on their specific circumstances.

September 16, 1952

This year's agricultural patriotic production increase campaign in Zhaoyuan County has begun to enter a new stage of development, and has put forward some important new experiences.

Zhaoyuan County's agricultural patriotic production increase campaign also has many shortcomings and areas where it is not doing well enough, and, moreover, it has only gone through spring plowing and summer hoeing so far, and recently nearly 20,000 hectares of crops have suffered relatively serious flooding, so it is not yet known what the autumn harvest will be like; however, in any case, the new development and new experiences of Zhaoyuan County's agricultural patriotic production increase campaign this year are of great significance to the agricultural production increase of the entire Heilongjiang Province, and we should value them.

What are the new developments and new experiences of Zhaoyuan County's agricultural patriotic production increase campaign this year? In general: they have begun to seriously study and put forward the possibilities of increasing production in farmland in Heilongjiang Province, the main problems in increasing production, and the main methods of increasing production, and have begun to create high yields per unit area on large plots of land, overcome the conservative thinking that seriously hinders agricultural production increase and the general and formalistic style in leadership methods, combined the Party's policies with specific leadership, and combined the mutual aid and cooperation movement with actively increasing the yield per unit area.

The Possibility of Increasing Land Production in Heilongjiang Province

The production capacity of each hectare of land in our province, under the current farming conditions, according to Zhaoyuan County's calculations, based on the total of five grains of sorghum, corn, millet, soybeans, and wheat, can average about 20 shi (i.e., 9,000 jin, equivalent to 4.5 tons) per hectare. However, the average yield of each hectare of land in Heilongjiang Province is currently only a little over 1.1 tons. The currently possible yield is about four times the actual yield. Even if the actual yield is only doubled, the entire province can produce an additional 4.5 million tons of grain, which can increase a huge amount of wealth for our country and the people of the entire province.

This spring, the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee conducted an actual survey on the ordinary land of an ordinary village in the county—Sihetun. Each hectare is 3,600 square bows; calculated according to a single row with a 2-foot wide furrow bottom, a row of 9,000 bows long is one hectare. They calculated that each bow length of the row can grow 80 millet plants, 7 sorghum plants, or 3 corn plants; then they collected medium-sized crop ears and calculated the weight of each ear of grain (corn is 3 liang, sorghum is 1.5 liang, and millet is 3 qian). As a result of this calculation, one hectare of millet is 47 shi, sorghum is 27 shi, and corn (calculated by single ear) is 18 shi. This is the yield per unit area that is generally possible to achieve on ordinary land with existing farming methods.

The "Three Zhao" areas (Zhaoyuan, Zhaodong, Zhaozhou) of Heilongjiang Province are medium-grade yellow-black soil. Hailun and Suihua in the east, and Nehe and Keshan in the north are the main grain-producing areas of the province, and are all more fertile black oil sandy soil, with greater potential and possibilities for increasing production.

The Main Problems and Main Methods of Agricultural Production Increase in Heilongjiang Province

In theory, each hectare of land in our province can produce an average of 20 shi of grain. So, why is each hectare of land only producing 4, 5, or 6 shi now? Why does it only reach a quarter or a third of the possible yield?

In old China, during the puppet Manchukuo period, because of the cruel oppression and exploitation of imperialism and the feudal landlord class, the vast number of peasants had no enthusiasm or ability to increase production at all, so it was natural that they could not fully utilize the land and could not produce more grain. Now, in the People's New China, the land reform has been completely completed, and the peasants themselves are the masters of the land. What is the reason that the yield of the land cannot reach the possible standard?

Zhaoyuan County conducted investigations and research and found a very obvious and very real reason, which is: the conservative thinking that peasants have formed over a long period of time under past production conditions has not yet been broken, so farming is rough, the density of seedlings is uneven, there are few seedlings, and the seedlings are damaged, resulting in many missing seedlings and broken rows (blank land).

The characteristic of Northeast agriculture is ridge cultivation, and the ridges in Heilongjiang Province are even larger. Now there are generally three types of ridges: the smallest ridge bottom is 1 foot 8 inches, the medium ridge is 2 feet or 2 feet 2 inches, and the large ridge is 2 feet 5 inches. According to Zhaoyuan County's calculation method, calculated by single ridge, a 2-foot ridge bottom, a ridge 9,000 bows long is one hectare; a 2-foot 5-inch ridge bottom, 7,200 bows long is one hectare; a 1-foot 8-inch ridge bottom, 10,600 bows long is one hectare. Therefore, if the plant spacing is the same, large ridge crops have one-third fewer seedlings than small ridge crops. (We now have this experience: wheat using new-style animal-drawn farm tools and flat ridge cultivation has more than twice as many plants as ordinary wheat, and produces more than twice as much grain.) This means that our general land crops have too few seedlings, and the land's fertility is greatly wasted. Not only is less planted, but there is also a widespread lack of seedlings. There are many reasons for the lack of seedlings: some are due to poor sowing techniques, resulting in uneven density in clumps, and some are due to poor soil covering during sowing, with thick coverings preventing emergence, and thin coverings exposing the seeds to the ground or leaving them in dry soil, where they are eaten by wild birds and severely damaged; poor hoeing and harrowing techniques can also damage roots and suppress seedlings. Therefore, as long as you calculate carefully, you will find that there is a lack of a quarter or even a third of the seedlings. Pest damage to crops is also a cause of seedling loss. In addition, there are many diseased plants in the crops. For example, 10% to 20% of sorghum and millet have smut disease per hectare. These are the biggest reasons for the reduction of production of various crops in our province, and the main problems that we should focus on solving.

In response to this situation, this summer we called on the entire province to vigorously promote the equal spacing thinning and topdressing fertilizer campaign. This has achieved certain results in various counties. Zhaoyuan County has already begun to pay attention to this issue since the spring, and has strived to promote the planting method of "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection." During the spring plowing season, because "flat ridge cultivation" cannot be universally promoted yet, they found appropriate methods to improve sowing, paying attention to small ridge cultivation, wide and even covering, ensuring that there are no clumps and no broken rows, and also paying attention to seedling protection, so the seedlings emerged neatly. Some missing seedlings were also transplanted and supplemented in a timely manner. In the middle of summer hoeing, equal spacing thinning work was vigorously promoted. According to Zhaoyuan County's experience, as long as appropriate equal spacing wide sowing (i.e., evenly widening the sowing width) is implemented according to different soil qualities and different crops, and efforts are made to maintain full seedlings, there will be more than twice as many seedlings as in the past, and it will be possible to produce more than twice as much grain.

When we say that "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection" are the main problems and the main methods of increasing production in today's agricultural production in our province, this certainly does not mean that other methods are not important or have no effect. For example, the progress that our province has made in recent years in seed selection, disinfection, soil improvement, increasing the number of hoeing times, especially increasing fertilizer application, is all beneficial to increasing production. Further promoting "wide sowing" now requires more fertilizer application and increased soil fertility; further paying attention to "equal spacing full seedlings" now requires more intensive weeding and thinning, and efforts to protect seedlings and prevent pests and diseases. Therefore, promoting the farming methods of "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection" and other various production increase methods complement each other and are not contradictory.

Most of the land in our province is "Great Northern Wilderness," and the old extensive farming methods have not yet been fundamentally transformed. The rural land in the entire province averages nearly one hectare per capita, and an average labor force has to plant five to six hectares of land, so there is a shortage of labor. Peasants are accustomed to "planting more" and do not pay enough attention to "planting well." The land is very fertile, but there is a lot of waste. Now, as long as we check from the requirement of "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection," we can know that in the past, our one hectare of land actually only produced the grain of three mu or even less than three mu. Why can't we produce more grain? The biggest reason is "few seedlings" and "not enough processing" (unequal spacing). Therefore, we specifically propose that "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection" are the main problems and the main methods of increasing production in today's agricultural production in our province.

We must also recognize that there is still the possibility of striving for higher yields per unit area in the future. We now use old-style wooden plows to plow the land to a depth of less than 12 centimeters. If we switch to new-style plows, we can reach 16 to 18 centimeters, and the land's fertility can be greatly improved. To achieve this, we need to solve the problems of new-style farm tools and horses, as well as technical problems. Further studying modern agricultural scientific knowledge and gradually cultivating high-yield new varieties are our more distant future and direction of development.

Mass Experience and Mass Work

Producing 15 shi or 20 shi or even 40 or 50 shi of grain per hectare is not empty talk, nor is it just a theoretical issue. This is a realistic high yield that has long existed among a small number of advanced peasants in our province, and is now beginning to increase.

After the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee raised the above-mentioned issue of the possibility of increasing land production to the masses, it discovered that in the past, peasants in various places had already created many high yields, almost every village had them. For example, in 1951, Song Zhenqi of Yanhai Village, Fifth District, produced 5 dou of millet from 9 li of land, equivalent to 55 shi per large hectare. Zhang Sen of Yangliu Village harvested 1 shi and 6 dou of wild millet from half a mu of land without hoeing or harrowing, only weeding twice, equivalent to over 32 shi per hectare. Luo Qinglin of Jianguo Village, Sixth District, produced 35 shi of sorghum per hectare. Their main experiences in high-yield are also having more seedlings and uniform seedlings. However, in the past, these examples of high yield were generally regarded by peasants as "flukes," and even superstitiously called this phenomenon "hitting a treasure field," and they did not dare to say it, fearing that if they said it, they would not be able to produce more grain again. The leading cadres, on the other hand, were bureaucratic, high above, without in-depth investigation and research, and simply did not know. Although we have promoted many general production increase experiences in the past, many areas have not grasped the main problems and main methods of increasing production in current production. The Zhaoyuan County Party Committee first learned from the masses in this regard and summarized the advanced experiences of the masses, which is of great significance to the entire province.

After the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee collected the advanced experiences of high yield from the masses, analyzed and studied them, and made conclusions, it then went through arduous mass work to promote and persist in them well among the masses. In this way, it is not limited to a few people creating new records of high yield on small plots of land. Only in this way can we achieve the goal of increasing production more. At the beginning of the spring plowing season, Zhaoyuan County's production increase campaign was only limited to some advanced production teams and a few labor models; after practical efforts, by the end of the first round of summer hoeing, it had greatly leaped forward. The area of land in the county striving to create new records of high yield increased from 912 hectares to 9,126 hectares. The number of villages striving to create new records increased from 16 to 30. On the land striving to create new records, 100% of the land was topdressed with fertilizer, and some was topdressed three times. Thinning was carried out on 27,000 hectares of crops such as millet and soybeans (including some sorghum), accounting for 22.9% of the cultivated land area. Land that was supplemented with missing seedlings and transplanted covered 5,159 hectares. Zhaoyuan County has 118,000 hectares of cultivated land. In the spring, the general plan was to increase production by 5 dou of grain per hectare, producing a total of 600,000 shi. At that time, the leading cadres believed that there was not much certainty. After summer hoeing, thinning, and topdressing fertilizer, with the aforementioned achievements, it is estimated that the nearly 10,000 hectares of land striving to create new records of high yield can roughly produce 150,000 shi of grain. According to current estimates, excluding 20,000 hectares of crops that have suffered serious flooding, if there are no more serious disasters, the county can still harvest 630,000 shi of grain in the fall.

Of course, promoting any advanced experience and turning it into a mass movement is impossible without detailed organizational leadership work, and simply allowing it to develop spontaneously. In order to improve the masses' enthusiasm for patriotic production increase and technical improvement, the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee repeatedly and deeply conducted education on the comparison between the old and new roads. In order to break various conservative ideas, they organized cadres and peasants to personally go to the fields to calculate stubble, calculate the number of plants, calculate the yield, and calculate the possibility of increasing production. Then, they launched discussions, analyzed the reasons for the reduction in production in the past, and found ways to increase production in the future. When promoting the production increase method of "equal spacing thinning," in order to overcome the peasants' fear of labor costs, they focused on cultivating typical examples, and then organized everyone to visit the fields of advanced peasants, and launched them to calculate detailed accounts and conduct learning. In order to solve the problem of labor shortage, they promptly launched joint team operations, and widely mobilized women and semi-laborers to participate in production. In addition, they paid special attention to mobilizing Party and League members to actively take the lead in the production increase campaign, and organized cadres to learn agricultural technical knowledge to help the masses solve various practical difficulties. Therefore, the resistance to improving farming methods that was prevalent among the masses during the spring plowing season was quickly reversed. The mutual aid and cooperation movement also improved a step, with 451 temporary and seasonal teams accounting for 10% of the total number of teams improving by one or two levels during summer hoeing. The masses were very happy and generally reflected: in previous years, they would "grumble" as soon as it came to hoeing, but this year they can plan for the long term!

In-depth Investigation and Research and Specific Leadership

The leading cadres of all counties in the province have also occasionally come into contact with the above situations. But why have they not been recognized and proposed earlier by everyone? The main reason is that the leadership is not in-depth.

Because the leading cadres did not earnestly go deep into the countryside, deep into the production process, and deep into investigation and research, they could not discover new problems in a timely manner. And the high yields created by peasants in the past by implementing "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection" were not scientifically summarized, so they only flashed by and were not valued by people. This loss now seems to be very great. We still have some comrades who, when it comes to leading agricultural production, believe that it is always the old routine of "spring plowing, summer hoeing, and autumn harvest," so they are unwilling to delve into it deeply and carefully, and even believe that they are relatively "familiar" with rural work and have relatively "experienced" in leading agricultural production, so they lose the sober mind that a Communist Party member should have and stick to old ways. Now, judging from Zhaoyuan's experience, we not only lack modern advanced agricultural scientific knowledge; we are also not very clear about the advanced experiences in past and present agricultural production. This is truly a great lesson.

Discovering important high-yield experience, conducting research and summarization, and then promoting it to the masses, this is a step forward in leadership. Peasants are the most practical; our best method is to educate peasants with realistic good examples. Therefore, we must understand in the most detailed way and specifically solve every obstacle and problem in the advancement of peasants and in agricultural production. A generalized leadership style and a mandatory command style are two manifestations of bureaucratic leadership and must be overcome. The former mainly exists among leading cadres above the county level; the latter mainly exists among basic-level cadres in districts and villages. When mobilizing the masses to complete a certain task, there is more commandism; when leading the masses in production work, there are more generalized expressions. This problem is very common. Therefore, if bureaucracy is not overthrown, if the generalized or commandist leadership style is not changed, and if the style of truly starting from the actual situation of the masses and solving problems in a deep and specific way cannot be well established, no work can be done well. This year's new development and new experience in Zhaoyuan County's agricultural production campaign has provided us with a model for improving the method of leading agricultural production.

Zhaoyuan County's agricultural production increase campaign this year has raised a major issue for the leadership of agricultural production in our province: in the new period when our country is about to begin large-scale economic construction, how can we ensure the rapid increase in agricultural production? Since the complete completion of land reform in our province, from 1948 to 1952, the average annual increase in production was 10%, with a cumulative rate of 8%. Our province has the most fertile land in the entire Northeast, and at the same time, the past farming methods were relatively backward, land fertility was quite wasted, and the potential of the land is enormous. Coupled with gradual collectivization and semi-mechanization and mechanization, then, although there are no conditions like in 1948 (when land reform had just passed) with a lower base number, it is no problem to continue to maintain an average annual increase of 10% over the next five years. That is to say, if this year's grain production is 4.5 million tons, the production in the fifth year after next year should increase by 2.25 million tons, i.e., an annual production of 6.75 million tons. However, now that we have Zhaoyuan's experience, we can consider increasing the annual production target by one time in five years, i.e., increasing production by another 4.5 million tons in the fifth year, with an annual production of 9 million tons of grain. That is, to increase the average yield of land in the entire province from 5 shi per hectare to 10 shi per hectare. This is why I feel that we should pay special attention to the new development and its experience in Zhaoyuan County's agricultural production increase campaign this year.

    我们应当重视肇源县今年农业爱国增产运动的新经验
    中共黑龙江省委书记  赵德尊高岗同志批示：
    黑龙江省委书记赵德尊同志，省人民政府主席于毅夫同志，肇源县委书记任国栋同志关于肇源县今年农业爱国增产运动新的经验的总结，给我们各省、县、区的领导机关和领导农村工作的干部，提出了一个极为重要的问题。根据肇源县委的报告，该县今年大量推广了“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗”的种植方法，并适时追肥，因而在全县出现了近万垧高额产量的丰产田，在这近万垧的丰产田上，每垧地的平均产量可能提高一倍到两倍。肇源县的经验说明：东北农业生产中的潜在力极大，只要我们能够重视发现农民群众中的先进经验，根据农业科学的方法，加以研究总结，然后予以推广，就可以使农业中的潜在力逐步发挥起来，从而大大地提高单位面积产量。肇源县的经验有这样几个新的值得重视的特点：第一、他们是在大片土地上做到了合理经营、多打粮食，因而该县的丰产运动就能够成为群众性的运动，取得群众热烈的拥护。目前有些省、县所提倡和推行的“丰产田”的做法，虽然也多少创造了一些高额产量的经验，但因为对这些经验缺乏总结，尤其缺乏推广，仅仅停留在一小块土地上，有的甚至不计成本，所以就一直没有成为群众性的丰产运动。这些地方应当学习肇源的经验。第二、他们的先进丰产经验的推广是在合作互助运动进一步发展的基础上开展起来的，没有大量的合作互助组和农业生产合作社的出现，是不可能使丰产运动成为群众性的运动的；而先进丰产经验的推广，又充实了合作互助运动的内容并推动了它的发展。因之，要把推广先进丰产经验和进一步发展与提高合作互助运动密切结合进行。第三、他们的增产办法，还只是在旧的耕作基础上加以改良，就可以提高单位面积产量一倍到两倍，这就是说：如果采用新式马拉农具，从根本上改革耕作方法，并把新旧农业技术结合起来，增产数量更不止此。因此，今后我们一方面应当继续重视总结推广农民固有的优良经验，同时更应十分重视推广马拉农具和新的耕作方法与农业科学技术的工作。
    各省、县、区的同志们应当很好地研究肇源县的领导方法，在今年秋收之后，总结本省、本县、本区的爱国增产运动的经验，特别是适合当地条件的高额产量的先进经验，然后召集农业生产合作社、各类生产合作互助组的积极分子加以讨论，以便根据他们的具体情况，提出各个农业生产合作社与各个生产合作互助组明年提高产量的计划与实现计划的办法。
    高岗
    一九五二年九月十六日
    今年肇源县的农业爱国增产运动，开始进入了一个新的发展阶段，并提出了一些重要的新经验。
    肇源县农业爱国增产运动也还有许多缺点和做得不够的地方，而且，现在还只经过春耕和夏锄，最近又有近两万垧庄稼遭到比较严重的水灾，秋收如何还不可知；但是，不管怎样，今年肇源县的农业爱国增产运动的新发展和新经验，对于黑龙江全省的农业增产是有着重大意义的，我们应当予以重视。
    今年肇源县农业爱国增产运动的新发展和新经验是什么呢？总的说：他们开始认真研究并提出了黑龙江省农田增产的可能性、增产中的主要问题和增产的主要方法，开始创造了大块土地上的单位面积高额产量，克服了严重阻碍农业增产的保守思想和领导方法上一般化的、形式主义的作风，把党的方针和具体领导结合起来，把互助合作运动和积极提高单位面积产量结合起来。
    黑龙江省土地增产的可能性
    我们省每垧土地的生产能力，在目前的耕作条件下，根据肇源县的计算，就高粱、苞米、谷子、大豆、小麦五种粮食总算，平均每垧可以打二十石左右（即九千斤，合四点五吨）。可是，现在黑龙江省每垧土地的产量平均却只有一点一吨强。目前可能达到的产量约为实际产量的四倍。即使仅把实际产量提高一倍，全省就可以多打四百五十万吨粮食，可给我们国家和全省人民增加一笔巨大的财富。
    今春，肇源县委在本县一个普通的屯子——四合屯的普通土地上作了实际调查。每垧为三千六百平方弓；按二尺宽的垅底的单垅计算，一条垅长九千弓为一垧。他们计算每一弓长的垅上可种谷子八十棵或高粱七棵或苞米三棵；然后收集中等的庄稼穗头，计算了每穗粮食的重量（苞米是三两，高粱一两半，谷子三钱）。这样计算的结果，一垧谷子是四十七石，高粱是二十七石，苞米（以单穗计）是十八石。这就是在普通土地上以现有耕作方法一般可能达到的单位面积产量。
    黑龙江省“三肇”地区（肇源、肇东、肇州）是黄黑土的中等地质。东部的海伦、绥化，北部的讷河、克山等县是全省的主要产粮区，都是更为肥沃的黑油沙土，增产的潜力和可能性更大。
    黑龙江省农业增产的主要问题和主要方法
    照道理说，我省每垧土地平均都能打二十石粮。那么，现在为什么每垧土地只打四、五石或五、六石？为什么只达到可能产量的四分之一或三分之一呢？
    在旧中国，在伪满时期，因为有帝国主义和封建地主阶级的残酷压榨和剥削，广大农民根本没有增加生产的积极性和能力，因此，不能充分发挥地力，不能多打粮食，那是很自然的。现在，在人民的新中国，土地改革已彻底完成，农民自己是土地的主人，是什么原因使土地的产量不能达到可能达到的标准呢？
    肇源县进行了调查研究，找出了一个很明显的、很实在的原因，就是：农民在过去的生产条件下长期形成的保守思想仍然没有打破，因之耕作粗糙，苗眼稀密不均，苗少，苗坏，很多缺苗、断条（空白地）。
    东北农作特点是培垅作业，黑龙江省培垅更大。现在一般有三种垅：最小的垅底是一尺八寸，中等垅是二尺或二尺二寸，大垅是二尺五寸。按照肇源县的计算方法，以单垅算，二尺垅底，垅长九千弓为一垧；二尺五的垅底，七千二百弓为一垧；一尺八寸垅底，一万零六百弓为一垧。因此，若是同等株距，大垅庄稼即比小垅少三分之一的苗数。（我们现在有这样的经验：使用新式马拉农具、实行平垅作业的小麦，棵数比一般的小麦多一倍以上，打粮也多打一倍以上。）这就是说，我们一般的土地庄稼苗太少，地力有很大浪费。不但种得少，而且普遍缺苗。缺苗的原因极多：有的是播种技术不高，一疙疸一块，稀密不匀，有的是播种时盖土不好，盖土厚的出不来，薄的露在地面或落在干土上，野雀吃，糟损得很厉害；铲地趟地技术不好，也会伤根压苗。因此，只要一细算，就缺苗四分之一甚至三分之一。害虫糟损庄稼，也是缺苗的一个原因。此外，庄稼的病株很多。如高粱谷子的黑穗病每垧都有十分之一、二。这些就是我省各种庄稼减产的最大原因，也就是我们应当着重解决的主要问题。
    针对这种情况，今夏我们曾号召全省大力推行等距间苗和追肥运动。这在各县都有一定成绩。肇源县从春天起就已经开始注意到这个问题，并努力推行了“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗”的种植方法。在春耕时期，因为现在还不能普遍地推行“平垅作业”，他们就找出改良播种的适当方法，注意了小垅作业，宽播匀盖，保证不成堆成撮，又不断条，同时又注意了保苗，因此苗出得齐整。有的缺苗，也及时进行了移补。夏锄中间，又大力推行了等距间苗工作。根据肇源县的经验，只要根据不同的土质、不同的作物实行适当的等距宽播（即均匀地加宽播幅），并尽力保持全苗，就比过去的庄稼苗多出一倍以上，也就可能多打一倍以上的粮食。
    我们说“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗”是我省今天农业生产中的主要问题与增产的主要办法，这当然不是说其他办法就不重要或没有作用。譬如我省几年来在选种、消毒、改良土壤、增加铲趟遍数，特别是增施肥料等方面的进步，对于增产都是有好处的。现在进一步提倡“宽播”，就更需要增施肥料，增加地力；现在进一步注意“等距全苗”，就更需要加工薅草间苗，想法保苗，防治病虫害。因此，提倡“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗”的耕作方法，和其他各种增产方法是相得益彰，并不矛盾的。
    我省大部土地是“北大荒”，旧的粗放的耕作方法还没有基本转变。全省农村土地，平均大小口每人近一垧地，平均一个劳动力要种五垧到六垧地，因此劳力不足。农民习惯“多种”，而对“种好”注意不够。地力很肥，但是浪费很大。现在，我们只要从“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗”这样一个要求来检查一下，就可以知道过去我们一垧土地实际上只打三亩甚至不到三亩地的粮食。为什么不能多打出粮食来？最大原因就是“苗少”，“加工不到”（不等距离）。因此，我们特别提出“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗”是我省今天农业生产的主要问题和增产的主要方法。
    我们还要认识，将来还有争取更高的单位面积产量的可能性。我们现在用旧式木犁耕地不到十二公分深，改用新式犁，可达十六至十八公分，地力也就能大为增进。要做到这一点，就要解决新式农具和马的问题，以及技术问题。进一步学习近代的农业科学知识，逐步培育高额产量的新品种，则是我们更远大的前途和发展方向。
    群众的经验和群众工作
    每垧地打十五石或二十石甚至四、五十石粮，这不是空话，也不仅是理论上的问题。这是在我省少数先进农民中早已存在，现在已经开始增多起来的现实的高额产量。
    肇源县委向群众提出了上述土地增产可能性的问题以后，就发现过去各地农民已经创造了许多高额产量，几乎村村都有。例如一九五一年，五区沿海村宋振起，九厘地打五斗谷子，合每大垧五十五石。杨柳村张森半亩野生糜子，未铲趟，仅薅间两次，收一石六斗，合一垧三十二石以上。六区建国村罗庆林的一垧高粱打三十五石。他们丰产的主要经验也都是苗多和苗匀。但是，过去这些高额产量的实例，一般农民只当做“碰运气”的事情，甚至迷信地把这现象叫做“打宝场”，不敢说，怕说破了就再不能多打粮了。而领导干部则是官僚主义，高高在上，没有深入调查研究，干脆不知道。我们过去虽然推广了许多一般的增产经验，但是很多地区没有抓紧当前生产的主要问题和增产中的主要方法。肇源县委首先在这方面向群众学习，总结了群众的先进经验，对全省有很大的意义。
    肇源县委把丰产的先进经验从群众中集中起来，加以分析研究，作出结论以后，再经过艰苦的群众工作，在群众中很好地推广并坚持下去。这样一来，就不限于少数人在小块土地上创造高额产量的新纪录了。只有这样，才能够达到更多增产的目的。在春耕开始时，肇源县的增产运动也只是停留在一些先进生产小组和少数劳动模范身上；经过切实的努力，在夏锄头遍结束时，就大大跃进了一步。全县争取创造高额产量新纪录的土地，由九百一十二垧提高到九千一百二十六垧。争取创造新纪录的村由十六个增至三十个。在争取创造新纪录的土地上，百分之百施了追肥，有的追了三次。谷子、大豆等作物间苗的达二万七千垧（包括部分高粱），占耕地面积百分之二十二点九。补缺移苗的地达五千一百五十九垧。肇源全县十一万八千垧耕地，春天一般计划每垧增产五斗粮，共产六十万石，当时领导干部认为把握不大。经过夏锄、间苗、追肥，取得前述成绩后，估计只是近一万垧争取创造丰产新纪录的土地，大体上就可产粮十五万石。据目前估计，全县除两万垧庄稼遭严重水灾不计外，如不再遭到严重灾害，秋季还可收获粮食六十三万石。
    当然，推广任何一个先进经验，并使之形成群众性的运动，如果没有细致的组织领导工作，而只是让它自发地发展，是不可能的。肇源县委为了提高群众爱国增产改进技术的积极性，反复地深入地进行了新旧道路对比的教育。为了打破各种保守思想，他们组织了干部、农民亲自到地里计算茬子，计算棵数，计算产量，计算增产的可能性。而后，又展开讨论，分析过去减产的原因，找出今后增产的办法。在推广“等距、间苗”的增产方法时，为了克服农民怕费工钱的思想，就着重培养典型，而后又组织大家到先进农民的地里去参观，并发动他们算细账，进行学习。为解决劳力不足的问题，及时发动了联组作业，并广泛地发动妇女、半劳动力参加生产。此外，特别注意了动员党、团员在增产运动中积极带头，并组织干部学习农业技术知识，帮助群众具体解决各种实际困难。因此，春耕时在群众中普遍存在的对改进耕作方法的抵抗情绪，很快被扭转了。互助合作运动也随着提高了一步，占总组数百分之十的临时组、季节组共四百五十一个在夏锄中提高了一级或两级。群众很高兴，普遍反映：往年一到铲地时就“打唧唧”，今年能往长远打算啦！
    深入调查研究和具体领导
    上述这些情况，全省各县领导干部也都曾不时地接触到过。但是为什么没有被大家更早认识和提出呢？主要原因是领导不深入。
    因为领导干部没有认真深入农村，深入生产过程，深入调查研究，所以就不能及时发现新的问题。而农民过去实行“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗”所创造的高额产量，由于没有得到科学的总结，也就昙花一现，不为人们所重视。这个损失现在看起来是很大的。我们现在还有这样一些同志，对于领导农业生产，认为反正是“春耕、夏锄、秋收”老一套，因此不肯深入地细心地钻研，甚至认为对于农村工作已经比较“熟悉”，领导农业生产也比较有“经验”，于是就丧失了共产党员应有的清醒头脑而故步自封。现在从肇源的经验来看，我们不仅缺乏近代的先进的农业科学知识；就是对于过去和现在农业生产中的先进经验也是不大清楚的。这真是个极大的教训。
    发现了重要的丰产经验，加以研究总结，然后再推广到群众中去，这便是领导深入了一步。农民是最讲实际的；我们最好的办法，就是用现实的好样子教育农民。因此，就要最细致地了解和具体解决在农民中间、在农业生产的前进道路上的每一个阻碍和问题。一般化的领导方式和强迫命令的作风，是官僚主义领导的两种表现形式，必须加以克服。前者，主要存在于县以上的领导干部中；后者，主要存在于区村基层干部中。当动员群众完成一定任务的时候，命令主义就多些；当领导群众生产工作的时候，一般化的表现就多些。这种毛病很普遍。因此，官僚主义若不打倒，一般化或命令主义的领导方式如不改变，真正从群众实际出发、深入地具体地解决问题的作风不能很好地建立起来，什么工作都是做不好的。今年肇源县农业生产运动的新发展和新经验，为我们提出了一个改进领导农业生产的方法的范例。
    肇源县今年的农业增产运动，给我省农业生产的领导方面提出了一个大问题：在我们国家即将开始进行大规模的经济建设的新时期，我们怎样保证农业方面的迅速增产呢？我省自土地改革彻底完成以后，从一九四八年到一九五二年，平均每年增产百分之十，累进比率是百分之八。我省有全东北最肥沃的土地，同时，过去的耕作方法比较落后，地力相当浪费，土地潜力极大。再加上逐步的合作化与半机械化和机械化，那末，虽然今后没有像一九四八年（土地改革刚刚过去）那样较低的基数的条件，在今后五年继续保持平均每年增产百分之十的速度前进，是没有问题的。那就是说，若是今年产粮四百五十万吨，明年后的第五年应增产二百二十五万吨，即年产六百七十五万吨。但是，现在由于有了肇源的经验，我们可以考虑在五年中把年产量指标提高一倍，即第五年再增产四百五十万吨，年产九百万吨粮食。也就是把全省土地每垧五石的产量，平均提高到十石的产量。这也就是我感到应当特别重视肇源县今年农业增产运动的新的发展及其经验的原因。
