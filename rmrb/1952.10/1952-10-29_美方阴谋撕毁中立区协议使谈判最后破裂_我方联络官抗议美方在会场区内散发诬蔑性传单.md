Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 28th. After deliberately suspending the negotiations, the US side is now further creating excuses to completely undermine the talks. Spokesmen for the US Eighth Army and Air Force in Korea issued statements on October 25th, claiming that our side was stockpiling and transporting military supplies in the neutral zone to "supply the western front." Observers here point out that this slander is clearly a smokescreen released by the US to completely tear up the neutral zone and conference area agreements and push the negotiations towards a final breakdown. The conspiracy of these US saboteurs of peace deserves the close attention of the world.

Since October 8th, the US side has continuously created five incidents of agreement violation. In addition to today's protest against the dropping of insulting leaflets in the conference area, the US side shelled the conference area twice and US aircraft intruded into the conference area twice. Every time the US side was forced to admit to violating the agreement, a new incident followed immediately. Immediately after the US military spokesman spread rumors, US aircraft intensified provocative bombing on the edge of the Kaesong neutral zone today. These are clearly pre-determined steps in the US's overall plan to undermine the negotiations.

Prior to October of last year, the two sides had agreed to designate Kaesong as a neutral zone where no armed forces would be stationed and no hostile acts would be conducted. In October of last year, when liaison officers from both sides negotiated on matters related to the resumption of delegation meetings, our side proposed that both the US delegation's residence in Munsan and our delegation's residence in Kaesong be designated as similar neutral zones. However, because the US side wanted to use Munsan to concentrate and transport troops and supplies on the western front, it insisted on overturning the original Kaesong neutral zone agreement and only designated Munsan and Kaesong as "restricted areas" where no hostile acts would be conducted. As a result, an agreement was reached according to the US side's opinion, and Article 7 of the agreement stipulated that within a radius of three miles around Munsan and Kaesong, "all armed forces of both sides, including all regular and irregular forces and armed personnel of the army, navy, and air force, shall not engage in any hostile acts."

Since the beginning of the negotiations, our side has consistently adhered to the agreement, while the US side has continuously violated it. They have repeatedly bombed and strafed Kaesong, dropped large numbers of flares over Kaesong, and sent armed personnel to infiltrate the Kaesong area to murder our military police. They have repeatedly shelled the Panmunjom conference area, injuring children in the conference area, used the conference area for various espionage activities, and dropped slanderous leaflets in the conference area. Their aircraft have frequently flown over the conference area and the Kaesong neutral zone, which were prohibited from being overflown according to the agreement. They have also repeatedly attacked our delegation's supply vehicles from the air, which were clearly agreed upon by both sides to be exempt from attack, killing one member of our delegation and injuring more than ten people. They have even deliberately attacked our prisoner-of-war camps, which were clearly marked in accordance with the agreement, killing and injuring more than two hundred of their own captured personnel. These recorded facts, which the US side has been forced to admit to many times, have thoroughly demonstrated to the world the US side's lack of credibility and sincerity.

Observers point out that the US military spokesman's deliberately misleading remarks, in fact, more clearly reveal the US's intention to further undermine the Panmunjom conference area and the Kaesong neutral zone agreement. If the US side dares to implement its plan to completely undermine the negotiations, they must bear full responsibility for all extremely serious consequences.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 28th. At around 8:00 AM on October 25th, slanderous leaflets distributed by the US side were found in the Korean armistice negotiation conference area. On October 27th, our chief liaison officer protested to the other side about the US side's violation of the agreement by distributing leaflets in the conference area, demanding that the other side earnestly abide by the agreement, strictly restrain their personnel, and prevent similar incidents from happening again.

    美方阴谋撕毁中立区协议使谈判最后破裂
    我方联络官抗议美方在会场区内散发诬蔑性传单
    【新华社开城二十八日电】美方在有计划地中止谈判以后，现在又进一步为彻底破坏谈判制造藉口，侵朝美军第八军及空军发言人在十月二十五日发表谈话，声称我方在中立区内堆存和运输军用物资，“供应西线”。此间观察家指出：这种谰言显然是美方为了要彻底撕毁双方中立区和会场区协议、把谈判推向最后破裂而放的烟幕。美国和平破坏者的这一阴谋，值得全世界密切注意。
    自十月八日以来，美方已连续制造了五次破坏协议事件。其中除今天我方抗议的在会场区投发侮辱性传单外，美方炮击会场区两次，美机侵入会场区两次。在美方每次被迫承认破坏协议的同时，新的事件就接踵发生。紧接着美军发言人散布谰言之后，美方飞机今天又在开城中立区边缘加紧进行挑衅性的滥炸。这些显然都是美方整个破坏谈判计划中的预定步骤。
    去年十月以前，双方曾协议把开城划为不驻扎武装部队、不进行敌对行为的中立区。去年十月间，双方联络官关于代表团复会事宜进行谈判时，我方提议把美方代表团驻地汶山及我方代表团驻地开城都划为同样的中立区。但是美方因为要把汶山用来在西线集结及运输部队和供应，就坚持推翻原开城中立区协议，只把汶山、开城划为不进行敌对行为的“限制区”。结果按美方意见达成协议，该协议第七条规定：在汶山及开城周围各以三英里为半径的区域，“双方一切武装力量，包括陆、海、空军的一切正规与非正规部队与武装人员，不得进行任何敌对行为”。
    自谈判开始以来，我方始终不渝地遵守协议，而美方却不断地破坏协议。他们多次轰炸及扫射开城，在开城上空投掷大批照明弹，派遣武装人员潜入开城地区谋杀我方军事警察。他们曾多次炮击板门店会场区，打伤会场区内的儿童，利用会场区进行各种特务活动，在会场区投掷诬蔑性的传单。他们的飞机经常飞越协议规定不得飞越的会场区及开城中立区。他们又曾多次自空中攻击经双方明确协议免受攻击的我方代表团供应车辆，打死我方代表团人员一名，打伤十余人。他们甚至于多次蓄意攻击按照协议设有明显标志的我方战俘营，打死打伤他们自己的被俘人员二百余人。这些纪录在案而且美方曾经多次被迫承认的事实，已向全世界彻底地证明了美方的毫无信义，毫无诚意。
    观察家指出：美军发言人蓄意混淆视听的谈话，事实上更明显地透露了美方进一步破坏板门店会场区及开城中立区协议的意图。美方若敢于执行他们彻底破坏谈判的计划，他们必须对一切极严重的后果负完全责任。
    【新华社开城二十八日电】十月二十五日上午八时左右，朝鲜停战谈判会场区内发现美方散发的诬蔑性传单。二十七日我方首席联络官对美方违反协议，在会场区内散发传单的这一事件，向对方提出抗议，要求对方切实遵守协议，严格约束对方人员，使类似事件不再发生。
