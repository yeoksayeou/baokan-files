    Northeast People's Government Industry Department
    Vigorously Prepares for Next Year's Capital Construction

    In order to meet the task of large-scale economic construction across the country, the Northeast People's Government Industry Department is vigorously preparing for next year's capital construction. The planning and design departments are currently reviewing in detail the engineering projects for 1953 and the planned task books for important projects, and have begun to allocate construction tasks to various construction companies. In order to improve the planning work for next year's capital construction, the planning department has begun to systematically summarize the experiences of compiling capital construction plans over the past three years from the bottom up; at the same time, it has also gathered a group of engineering and technical personnel to compile engineering budget quotas as the basis for compiling annual plans. Doing a good job in design is the primary issue to ensure on-time construction and completion of capital construction plans next year. The Northeast People's Government Industry Department is strengthening its leadership over the design departments of various bureaus and companies, actively strengthening the design force, and has assembled a large number of translators to translate foreign design drawings for various major projects. At the same time, a group of design forces has been specially organized to carry out the standard design of residential houses with the help of Soviet experts, in order to avoid repeated design and waste of design resources. Currently, the Civil Architecture Design Company has created 183 kinds of standard wooden windows. In order to create conditions for correct design, geological exploration and drilling are also being carried out vigorously.

    In order to avoid the phenomenon of labor mobility, the Northeast People's Government Industry Department has decided to fix 70,000 construction workers this winter as long-term construction workers. At the same time, the Ministry of Industry plans to invest more than 10,000 installation technicians trained from various technical schools this year in next year's large-scale installation projects. This winter, all fixed workers and technicians will undergo systematic and large-scale consolidation and training, and they will be given systematic political and technical education in order to train and promote cadres. The First Engineering Company of the Northeast People's Government Industry Department alone plans to train 2,000 construction workers, site directors, foremen, and material management personnel promoted from workers. Next year, the capital construction tasks in Northeast China will all be contracted by construction and installation enterprises with materials included. In order to strengthen material management, the Northeast People's Government Industry Department has obtained the assistance of the Northeast Committee of the Communist Youth League and has mobilized 2,200 young intellectuals from rural areas to participate in this work.

    In next year's capital construction in Northeast China, the proportion of mechanized construction will increase significantly. The Northeast People's Government Industry Department has preliminarily decided to carry out large-scale mechanized construction on six key projects including Northeast Institute of Technology, and the degree of mechanization should reach 60 percent. Heavy physical labor such as excavation, hoisting, transportation, and concrete mixing can basically be replaced by mechanical operation.

    In addition, the sites of various major projects have begun to build various welfare facilities such as power sources, water sources, and staff dormitories necessary for next year's construction. Necessary building materials have also begun to be stockpiled.

    东北人民政府工业部
    大力进行明年基本建设的准备工作
    为了迎接全国大规模经济建设的任务，东北人民政府工业部正大力进行明年基本建设的准备工作。计划和设计部门现正详细审核一九五三年的工程项目和重要工程的计划任务书，并已将施工任务开始分配给各工程公司。为了改进明年基本建设的计划工作，计划部门已开始自下而上系统地总结三年来编制基本建设计划的经验；同时还集中了一批工程技术人员编制工程概算定额，作为编制年计划的依据。做好设计工作是保证明年按期施工、完成基本建设计划的首要问题。东北人民政府工业部正加强对各管理局、公司设计部门的领导，积极充实设计力量，并集中了大批翻译人员翻译各主要工程的国外设计图纸。同时还专门组织了一批设计力量，在苏联专家的帮助下，着手进行住宅房屋的标准设计工作，以避免重复设计，浪费设计力量。现在土木建筑设计公司已创造出标准木窗一百八十三种。为了给正确的设计创造条件，地质勘察和钻探工作也在大力进行。
    为避免劳动力流动的现象，东北人民政府工业部决定今冬把七万名建筑工人固定起来，作为长年建筑工人。同时，工业部准备把今年从各技工学校培养出来的一万余名安装技术工人投入明年大规模的安装工程。对所有固定工人和技术人员，今冬将进行有计划的大规模的整训，向他们进行系统的政治教育与技术教育，以便培养和提拔干部。仅东北人民政府工业部第一工程公司就准备训练二千名从工人中提拔的施工员、工地主任、领工员及材料管理人员。明年东北基本建设任务将全部由建筑安装企业包工包料。为了加强材料管理工作，东北人民政府工业部取得青年团东北委员会的帮助，已从农村中动员了二千二百名青年知识分子参加这一工作。
    在东北明年的基本建设中，机械化施工比重将有显著增加，东北人民政府工业部并初步决定在东北工学院等六项重点工程上进行较大规模的机械化施工，其机械化程度要达到百分之六十。如挖土、起重、运输、混凝土搅拌等沉重体力劳动，基本上都可以运用机械代替人工操作。
    此外，目前各主要工程所在地已开始修建明年施工中必需的电源、水源及职工宿舍等各种福利设施。必要的建筑材料也已开始储备。
