    Longyou County Tashi Supply and Marketing Cooperative Only Cares About Making Money, Affecting Mass Production
    Editor: The cadres of the Tashi Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Longyou County, Zhejiang Province, have a serious tendency towards pure profit-seeking, which has affected mass production and caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. When the cooperative purchases rice from its members and sells them daily necessities, it often uses a larger scale for intake and a smaller scale for output. 社員 Huang Rongxiang lost seven and a half jin when selling three hundred jin of grain to the cooperative; the salt purchased by 社員 from the cooperative was short by one liang or five qian per jin. More seriously, in order to make money, the cooperative sold more than 140 dan of green fertilizer cakes to the Mohuan District at a high price of 68,000 yuan per dan (the local market price was 65,000 yuan per dan) in the first half of this year, regardless of the needs of its members. As a result, the members of the cooperative could not buy green fertilizer cakes, which seriously affected rice seedling fertilization. When the members were in great need of soybean seeds, the cooperative sold good soybeans to private merchants to make tofu, and sold more than 1,000 jin of bad soybean seeds to the members, which seriously affected production. Wang Peisheng bought ten jin of soybean seeds and planted one mu and five fen, but not a single sprout grew. The cooperative members are all dissatisfied with this practice of the cooperative.
    The reason for the above errors is mainly that the cadres of the Tashi Supply and Marketing Cooperative have a purely profit-seeking viewpoint, which violates the cooperative's business policy of "serving the members and serving production"; secondly, the cadres of the Longyou County Cooperative have a bureaucratic work style, and have not gone deep into the lower levels to understand the situation, strengthen the leadership of the lower-level cooperatives, and educate the cadres. It is hoped that the relevant departments will quickly check and correct the above problems.

    龙游县塔石供销合作社只图赚钱影响群众生产
    编辑同志：浙江省龙游县塔石供销合作社的干部有严重的单纯营利思想，影响了群众的生产，引起群众极大不满。该社在收购社员的稻谷和卖给社员生活必需品时，常常大秤进小秤出。社员黄荣祥把三百斤谷子卖给合作社，竟少了七斤半；社员从合作社买来的食盐，每斤少一两、五钱不等。更严重的是：该社为了赚钱，在今年上半年不顾社员的需要，就把一百四十多担青饼，以六万八千元一担的高价（当地时价为六万五千元一担），卖给模环区，该社社员因此买不到青饼，严重地影响了秧田施肥。在社员很需要黄豆种的时候，该社竟把好黄豆卖给私商做豆腐，而把一千多斤坏豆种卖给社员，严重地影响了生产。王培生买去十斤豆种，种了一亩五分，结果没有发一根芽。社员群众对该社这种作风都不满意。
    造成以上错误的原因，主要是塔石供销合作社干部有单纯营利观点，违背了合作社“为社员服务，为生产服务”的经营方针；其次是龙游县社的干部有官僚主义作风，没有深入下层了解情况，加强对下级社的领导和对干部的教育。希望有关部门迅速对上述问题检查纠正。
