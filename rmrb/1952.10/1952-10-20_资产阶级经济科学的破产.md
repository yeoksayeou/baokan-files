The study of economic science touches upon the most fundamental interests of the ruling classes in capitalist countries. This is because it examines the very foundation of bourgeois society. It is therefore no surprise that numerous defenders of the capitalist system—especially in the leading imperialist country, the United States—are engaged in the study of economic science. The function of this science (bourgeois economic science) is to attempt to confuse and deceive the masses in order to prolong the shameful survival of the dying capitalist system.

At present, since the very concept of capitalism has lost credibility, bourgeois scholars have been forced to concoct special "theories" to portray the American capitalist system as something unique and different from its Western European counterparts. The myth of "American exceptionalism" belongs to this category of "theories." According to this myth, the general laws of capitalism and its inherent crises, unemployment, the absolute and relative impoverishment of the working class, and antagonistic class contradictions supposedly do not apply in the United States. From the proponents of the "exceptionalism" theory, one hears that: first, American capitalism is not capitalism at all; second, even if it is capitalism, it is a special kind. What labels haven't American bourgeois economists put on the rotting commodity of "capitalism": "democratic capitalism," "state capitalism," "progressive capitalism," and "a nation of people's happiness." All of this is to prove the unprovable: that the American capitalist system seems to be something high above and outside the world capitalist system. To find a basis for this "exceptionalism" theory, they make some false statements.

Fabrication one: The system of free enterprise activity seems to be the indestructible foundation of the American economy, and various small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. They say that the democratization of capital originated in the United States. For example, the famous American economist, Harvard University Professor Slichter, in his book "The American Economy: Prospects," published last year, asserted that small businesses, with their numerous numbers, dominate the United States.

Some American bourgeois economists cannot deny the expansion of monopoly capital, but they are doing everything possible to minimize this expansion. They attempt to prove that monopoly capital can coexist peacefully with independent small businesses. For example, Johnston says that the way to continue the development of the American economy is to "realistically adapt the old system of free capitalism to the modern economy." Clark, the most prominent representative of bourgeois economics, in his "The Distribution of Wealth" (along with most bourgeois scholars), spread illusions about the possibility of avoiding the expansion of monopoly capital through special government measures.

Yes, it is true that the majority of enterprises in the United States are small businesses, but the problem is that the overwhelming majority of products do not belong to them, but to the large industrialists.

On the one hand, the monopolization of production and the bankruptcy of the middle class, and on the other hand, the growth of the industrial proletariat, increasingly divide bourgeois society into two opposing classes: the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.

As for the "democratization of capital" that originated in the United States—that is, the increase in the number of shareholders and the so-called "fair distribution of wealth"—there are irrefutable facts: In the United States, 10,000 of the richest capitalists control more than half of the nation's share capital.

The United States is a country of monopoly capital, and monopoly capital is the highest expression of the imperialist economy.

Fabrication two: It seems that the American government is democratically supervising the American economy and can use its intervention in the economy to adjust the capitalist economy and try to eliminate crises. At the same time, the bourgeois state is depicted as some kind of super-class institution located above monopoly capital. All of these statements are based on the theories of the recently deceased prophet of modern bourgeois economics, the British scholar Keynes. Keynes proposed a whole set of plans for managing economic life through the state: that is, using methods such as supervising investment, increasing unproductive demand, constantly increasing taxation, and expanding the national debt as tools to save the capitalist system.

American Keynesian successors—Hansen, Bowkin, Clark, and others—are singing praises of the policies of "adjusting inflation" and "state compensatory expenditure" and are finding theoretical bases for them. The Keynesian school suggests expanding taxes and advocates not stopping their policies because of budget deficits and the growth of national debt.

American economists are trying to portray state management as establishing a "capitalist system without crises" and overcoming the anarchy of production. Moulton, the president of the Brookings Institution, asserted that the state can guarantee planned leadership of the economy.

What the defenders of capitalism call "democratic capitalism," "mixed economy," and treat as the "supervision" of the state over monopoly capital is actually a kind of state-monopoly capitalism. Under this system, monopoly capitalists use the bourgeois state apparatus, which is completely dependent on them, to obtain maximum profits and carry out horrifying oppression of the working class and other working people.

Lenin wrote: "When capitalists describe the state's measures to guarantee them triple profits (if not tenfold!) as 'supervision,' they are lying."

Life proves what the "adjustment" policy and its included inflation and increasing national debt are for, and what they will lead to—the result is the wealth of monopoly capital and the poverty of the masses.

Fabrication three: It seems that the American way of life means a high standard of living and full employment for all. American bourgeois economists like to use two methods to prove this fabrication. They divide the total number of national income by the population number, thus obtaining the average figure of personal national income. Although the figure of this national income itself is obviously inflated. The lack of scientific basis for this calculation is obvious: this average figure hides the fact that the income of a small number of parasitic upper classes is millions, while the income of the main working masses is pitifully small.

The second method is very similar to the first: they quote the so-called average weekly wage figures of workers, and then raise a startling clamor, talking about the high wages in the United States. But in fact, in this average figure, which includes workers' wages, the salaries of all the senior staff of monopoly capitalists, up to the managers of large companies, are also listed. The manager of "General Motors" can earn more than $11,000 a week, while the average worker in the company earns less than $66 a week. Naturally, the average figure obtained by such a calculation method must be high. Moreover, this calculation does not involve the ranks of the unemployed and semi-unemployed, and as is well known, the lives of the unemployed are borne by the income of employed members of the family, which will reduce the living standards of the whole family. Finally, the average figure of this wage also hides the large disparity between the rather high wages of the worker aristocracy raised by monopoly capitalists (relying on the super-exploitation of domestic colonial slaves—blacks and Mexicans) and the low wages of the majority of the main working class (especially those of non-Anglo-Saxon descent).

Fabrication four: It seems that the medium and small farms in the United States are prospering, and all families can guarantee their members have a high standard of living. However, irrefutable facts prove that medium and small farmers are going bankrupt and are being forced to give up their land and transfer it to the hands of large landowners.

Not long ago, the United States announced the figures of the 1950 census. Despite the incompleteness and deliberate falsification inherent in bourgeois statistics, it still overturned the claim of the "happiness" of American farmers. In the fifteen years from 1935 to 1950, the number of farms in the United States decreased by nearly one and a half million. From 1940 to 1950, the number of rural population in the United States decreased by 6,659,000 people.

The following facts illustrate the "happiness" of the basic farmer masses: ten percent of the national farm economy is a huge capitalist economy; it produces half of the national agricultural commodities.

Financial capital is increasingly enslaving American farmers. Farmers' debts to banks are increasing, and most farmers' land is mortgaged as collateral for debts. This in fact means that farmers' ownership of land has been deprived.

The materials of the population survey overturn the myth that American agriculture has reached a high degree of saturation of modern mechanization equipment. More than half of American farmers do not have mechanical equipment, and in general, most people do not have animal power. The myth of bourgeois economics about the prosperity of farmers has been shattered.

Fabrication five: It seems that militarism—that is, expanding armed forces and carrying out arms expansion—and war itself are the panacea for treating all the diseases suffered by the capitalist economy. This "theory" originated directly from Keynes's theory and constitutes its most important part. Keynes wrote: "War is the only form of huge expenditure relying on a large amount of borrowing, which general politicians consider justified..." American Keynesian believer Bowkin asserted that "war is the only acceptable method of creating large-scale demand..."

In the United States, the increase in military products relies on the reduction of civilian production. This fact is another blow to the American "exceptionalism theory."

In the United States, all those popular arguments, such as: only the use of war can guarantee full employment in the current economic system; armaments can guarantee prosperity; militarization can avoid industrial paralysis, etc., are tantamount to admitting the decline and imminent death of the capitalist system.

Fabrication six: It seems that America's "dynamic (!) capitalism" will revive the dying capitalism in Western Europe, consolidate the position of capitalism in the colonies, and make the capitalist system survive forever.

Scholar lackeys of American imperialism are making every effort to praise the "Marshall Plan," regarding it as the practical implementation of a plan to revive the decadent Western European capitalist society. The "Marshall" plan has formally come to an end. What are its consequences? Thanks to the "grace" of American capitalism, the economies of Western European countries have become weaker, many industrial sectors and some individual enterprises have ceased to exist, the monetary system has fallen into chaos, the material environment of the masses has deteriorated; and most importantly, the anger of the working class towards this social system and its protectors is growing. This social system is living its final years, but it is unwilling to automatically withdraw from the stage.

American capitalism's summing up of the results of implementing Truman's so-called "Point Four" plan to aid the world's backward countries is equally shameful. This "aid" is actually just an attempt by American imperialism to bring the colonies and semi-colonies under its jurisdiction. The growth of the national liberation movement in the colonies and dependencies has doomed the American attempt to consolidate capitalist control over the colonies to failure.

Now, the bankruptcy of the theories about the "arrival of the American capitalist century" and "organizing a unified capitalist world under the protection of the United States" is very clear.

The modern capitalist system, shrouded in a comprehensive crisis, both economically and politically, is no longer capable of construction; it can only destroy. At the same time, its economists can only put forward pseudo-scientific theories with a large amount of anesthetic, or, in despair, indulge in skepticism, replacing science with fraud.

For them, there is no other way out. Because if they study the economics of modern capitalism with a scientific attitude, they must admit that its situation is hopeless, and admit that the destruction of capitalism is inevitable.

    资产阶级经济科学的破产
    苏联  契普拉柯夫
    经济科学牵涉到资本主义国家统治阶级最根本的利益。因为这里所研究的是资产阶级社会的基础。因此无怪乎资本主义制度的许多辩护者们——特别是在美国这样一个帝国主义的主要国家要从事于经济科学的研究。这种科学（资产阶级的经济科学）的作用是企图迷惑和欺骗群众，以便使垂死的资本主义制度的可耻生存延长下去。
    目前，由于资本主义这个概念本身已经失掉信用，资产阶级的学者们于是不得不臆造出一些特殊的“理论”，把美国的资本主义制度说成是异于它的西欧伙伴的某种特别的东西。关于“美国的特殊性”的神话就是属于这类“理论”的。依照这种神话，资本主义的总规律和它所含的危机、失业、工人阶级的绝对和相对的贫困、对抗性的阶级矛盾等，在美国都仿佛不发生作用。从“特殊性”理论的拥护者们那里听到的是：第一，美国的资本主义决不是资本主义；第二，就算它是资本主义，它不管怎样也是特别的一种。美国资产阶级的经济学者们在“资本主义”这个腐烂的商品上什么标签没有贴过呢：“民主的资本主义”，“国家资本主义”，
    “进步的资本主义”和“人民幸福的国家”。所有这一切都是为了要证明那不可证明的东西：美国的资本主义制度似乎是在世界资本主义制度之外的某种高高在上的东西。为了要替这个“特殊性”理论找根据，他们作了一些虚伪的论述。
    伪造之一：仿佛自由企业活动的制度就是美国经济的牢不可破的基础，而各种小企业则是美国经济的中坚。他们说，资本的民主化是发源于美国的。例如著名美国经济学者、哈佛大学教授史里切尔在他去年出版的“美国经济的展望”一书中就断言说，小企业以它数目的众多，在统治着美国。
    一部分美国资产阶级的经济学者们无法否认垄断资本的膨胀，可是他们却在千方百计地努力缩小这种膨胀，他们企图证明垄断资本是可以和独立的小企业和平共存的。例如蒋士顿说，使美国经济继续发展的道路就是：使“旧的自由资本主义制度现实主义地适应于现代经济。”资产阶级经济学最显著的代表克拉克在他的“财富的分配”一书中（和他一道的还有，大多数资产阶级的学者）就散布着有关可能通过政府的特殊措施来避免垄断资本的膨胀的幻觉。
    是的，确实的，美国的大多数企业都是小企业，但问题却在于占压倒多数的产品并不归它们，而是归大工业家所有。
    一方面是生产的垄断化和中层阶级的破产，另方面是工业无产阶级的增长，使资产阶级社会愈益分化为两个对立的阶级——资产阶级和无产阶级。
    至于说到发源于美国的“资本的民主化”——即股票所有人的增多和所谓“财富的公平分配”，那么这里有无可辩驳的事实：在美国一万个最有钱的资本家在掌握着全国半数以上的股份资本。
    美国是一个垄断资本的国家，而垄断资本正是帝国主义经济的最高表现。
    伪造之二。似乎美国政府正在对美国的经济进行民主监督，并可能用它的对经济的干涉来调整资本主义经济，设法消灭危机。与此同时，资产阶级的国家被描写成某种位于垄断资本之上的超阶级的机构。所有这些言论都是以不久以前逝世的、现代资产阶级经济学者的预言家，英国学者凯恩斯的理论为基础的。凯恩斯提出了通过国家来管理经济生活的整套计划：即以监督投资、增加非生产性的需求，不断地增加课税、膨胀国家的债务等方法，作为拯救资本主义制度的工具。
    美国的凯恩斯的继承者们——汉森、鲍金、克拉克和其他的人们正在歌颂“调整性的通货膨胀”和
    “国家补偿性支出”的政策，并为它们找理论根据。凯恩斯学派建议扩大税收，并主张不因预算的发生赤字和国家债务的增长而中止他们的政策。
    美国的经济学者们企图把国家的管理说成是在建立“没有危机的资本主义制度”和克服生产的无政府状态。布鲁金社会研究学院院长莫里顿断言，国家可以保证对经济作有计划的领导。
    被资本主义的辩护人称之为“民主的资本主义制度”“混和的经济”，并把它当作是国家对垄断资本的“监督”的东西，实际上只是一种国家垄断性资本主义制度。在这种制度下，垄断资本家利用了完全依附于他的资产阶级的国家机构，获得最大限度的利润，并对工人阶级和其他劳动人民进行骇人听闻的压迫。
    列宁写道：“当资本家把国家的有计划地为他们保证三倍利润（如果不是十倍！）的措施说成是‘监督’的时候，他们是在说谎。”
    生活证明，“调整”政策同它所包含的通货膨胀和增加国家债务是为了谁的利益，并会导向什么结果——这结果就是垄断资本的发财和大众的贫困。
    伪造之三：仿佛美国的生活方式就是指高度的生活水平和全民的充分就业的。美国资产阶级的经济学者们最喜欢用两个方法来证明这个伪造。他们用人口数除国民收入的总数，从而得出个人国民收入的平均数字。虽则这种国民收入的数字本身显然是被提高了的。这种计算的缺乏科学根据是很明显的：这个平均数字掩盖了少数寄生的上层分子的收入是数以百万计，而主要的劳苦大众的收入则微少到十分可怜的事实。
    第二个方法和第一个很相类似：他们引用了所谓工人每周的平均工资数字，然后掀起了惊人的喧嚣，谈论着美国的高额工资。但是实际上在这个包括工人工资在内的平均数字中，也列入了所有垄断资本家的高级职员，直到大公司经理的薪金。“通用汽车公司”的经理每周可以获得一万一千多美元，而该公司的工人每周平均所获得的却不到六十六美元。自然，以这样的计算方法得出的平均数字一定是高的。不但如此，在此项计算中，还没有涉及失业和半失业的队伍，而如所周知，失业者的生活要由家庭中就业成员的收入来担负，这是会使全家的生活水平降低的。最后，这个工资的平均数字又把独占资本家（依靠对国内的殖民地奴隶——黑人和墨西哥人——的超额剥削）所豢养的工人贵族的相当高的工资和主要的工人阶级（特别是非盎格鲁撒克逊血统的）大众的低工资之间的大小悬殊隐藏起来了。
    伪造之四：好像美国的中、小农场都正在繁荣着，而所有的家庭都能保证它的成员有着高度的生活水平。但是，无可辩驳的事实证明：中、小农民正在破产，正被迫得放弃了他们的土地，而把它转移到大地主的手中。
    不久以前，美国公布了一九五○年举行的人口普查的数字。这些数字尽管有着资产阶级统计学所特具的不完备性和有意的伪造，但它仍然推翻了有关美国农民“幸福”的说法。在一九三五到一九五○年的十五年中，美国农场的数量减少了几达一百五十万个。一九四○年起到一九五○年止美国农村人口数字减少了六百六十五万九千人。
    下列事实说明了有关基本农民群众的“幸福”：全国农场经济的百分之十是巨大的资本主义经济；它生产着全国半数的农业商品。
    金融资本日益加深地奴役着美国的农民。农民欠银行的债务在增加着，大部分农民的土地都被抵押作为债务的担保品。这事实上意味着农民对土地的所有权已被剥夺。
    人口调查的材料推翻了关于美国的农业已经达到了现代机械化设备的高度饱和状态的神话。半数以上的美国农民都没有机械装备，而总的说，大部分人都没有畜力，资产阶级经济学的有关农民繁荣的神话就这样破灭了。
    伪造之五，仿佛军国主义——即扩大武装部队和进行军备扩张——和战争本身是用以治疗资本主义经济所患一切疾病的万应灵丹。这个“理论”直接起源于凯恩斯的学说，并且构成了它的最重要的一部分。凯恩斯写道：“战争是依靠大量借债，实行巨额支出的唯一形式，这种支出形式是一般政治家认为正当的……。”美国的凯恩斯信徒鲍金断言，
    “战争是造成大规模需求的唯一可以被接受的方法……”
    在美国，军用产品的增加有赖于对民用生产的缩减，这一个事实是对美国“特殊性理论”的又一次打击。
    在美国，所有那些风行一时的议论，如：在目前的经济制度中只有利用战争才能保证充分就业；军备可以保证繁荣；军国主义化可以避免工业瘫痪等等，都无异承认了资本主义制度的衰颓和已垂于死亡。
    伪造之六，仿佛美国的“有动力（！）的资本主义”将会使垂死的西欧资本主义复活，会使资本主义在殖民地的地位巩固，并使资本主义制度永远生存下去。
    美帝国主义的奴才学者们正在以全力歌颂“马歇尔计划”，把它看作是对于复兴腐朽的西欧资本主义社会的方案的实际推行。“马歇尔”计划形式上已告结束，它的后果如何呢？由于美国资本主义的“恩典”，西欧国家的经济变得更衰弱了，很多工业部门和一些个别的企业已经不复存在，货币制度陷入混乱状态，大众的物质环境趋于恶化；而最主要的是，工人阶级对于这一社会制度及其庇护者的愤怒在增长。这个社会制度正度着它的最后岁月，但它却不愿自动退出舞台。
    美国资本主义在总结实施杜鲁门的所谓援助世界落后国家的“第四点”计划方面，其结果是同样的可耻。这一“援助”，实际上只是美帝国主义使殖民地和半殖民地各国归自己管辖的一种尝试。殖民地和各附属国中的民族解放运动的增长注定了美国企图巩固资本主义制度对殖民地的控制的努力必归于失败。
    现在，有关“美国资本主义世纪的到来”和“在美国的保护下组织统一的资本主义世界”的理论的破产，已经十分明显。
    不论是经济上、政治上都为全面危机所笼罩的现代资本主义制度，已经无力再从事建设，它仅仅能够破坏罢了。同时它的经济学者也仅仅能够提出伪科学的带有大量麻醉性的论调，或者，在绝望之余，沉溺于怀疑主义，用诈骗来代替科学罢了。
    对于他们说来，其他的出路是不可能有的。因为如果他们用科学的态度来研究现代资本主义的经济，他们就必须承认它的处境是绝望的，承认资本主义的毁灭是不可避免的。（振亚译自六月十日苏联文学报）
