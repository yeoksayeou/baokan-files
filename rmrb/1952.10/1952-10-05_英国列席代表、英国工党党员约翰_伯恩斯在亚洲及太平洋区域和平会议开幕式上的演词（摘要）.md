Mr. Chairman:

    First, allow me to express my gratitude for your permission to speak at this great conference. Secondly, I want to thank those who made it possible for me to attend this conference; I deeply appreciate the honor bestowed upon me. Although I am a member of the British Labour Party and part of the trade union movement, I must first state that I am here in a personal capacity, and I have not been commissioned to speak on behalf of the political or industrial aspects of the British labor movement. I need hardly emphasize the immense excitement I felt when I received the invitation to come to Beijing.

    When I see this great conference, representing so many nations, and hear of the difficulties and obstacles encountered by many delegations in their attempts to attend—a point I will address later—I know that only one theme could give rise to such a grand event. This theme, I believe, is the paramount issue in the world today. I am referring, of course, to the question of world peace. Every clear-headed person, regardless of their color or creed, and regardless of their party affiliation or lack thereof, must realize that we are at a moment of ominous gravity. Likewise, they will recognize that any irresponsible action could ignite the powder keg that would destroy civilization, something we are all aware of today.

    The problem is that simple. Because it is a matter of life and death, concerning the survival or destruction of humanity in the world.

    Equally true is that if the issue of peace between nations can be resolved, then naturally, with the elimination of the need for rearmament, other pressing and urgent problems, such as aid to underdeveloped regions, the establishment of social welfare programs, hospitals, housing, schools, and so on, will also be resolved.

    When we talk about freedom, I have always maintained that not only should I have freedom, but others should have freedom as well. The freedom I am referring to is not limited to individual freedom, but in the broadest sense, the freedom for all nations to enjoy autonomy and full sovereignty. I am well aware that there are many people all over the world who share the same firm view.

    For several years, it has been a recognized fact among the vast majority of workers in Western democracies that their living standards should be higher than those of Asian workers. But today, it is widely recognized that if humanity is to enjoy its due rights, then this notion is wrong. It is morally wrong that some can enjoy the highest possible living standards, freely and fully enjoying all social services, without worrying about illness, pensions, and retirement, while others, simply because of where they live, must endure the suffering of hunger, ignorance, and disease.

    Such a social system is extremely unfair; it dictates that a person enjoys a certain standard of living, or is destined to endure another, not based on their current performance, but based on their place of birth. This point, as I have said, is becoming increasingly clear to British workers. I believe that the day will come when the people of more fortunate countries will accept the fact that, in order to improve the lives of their brothers and sisters in less fortunate countries, they must be satisfied with their existing living standards, at least until equality is achieved among the peoples of the world. Ultimately, this is beneficial to both sides, because once everyone's living standards are equal, both sides can move forward together.

    Reverend Maynard has already spoken about what I was planning to talk about in my next point, and I just want to emphasize what he said now. But I would like to add that nine thousand people gathered at Queen's Hall on September 14th, which would have been impossible a year ago. What is happening in Britain has awakened the growing vigilance of the people.

    Who is afraid of peace? Not you and me, nor the broad masses of the people. Only those who see closer relations between people of all races and creeds as a threat to their economic power are afraid of peace. They will do everything possible, by any means, to divide the countries of the world and keep them divided. They always have been, and always will be, ruthless in achieving their goals.

    But no matter what means they use, no matter what tactics they employ, there is still only one world—only one complete world. If humanity wants to divide the world into two armed camps, even if this idea lasts for only a second, it is completely suicidal. In those conditions and under those circumstances, progress is simply impossible. With such an environment, how can there be freedom?

    Let's be clearer. The economic rulers of the world only understand one freedom, and that is the freedom to exploit the masses for their own power and profit. Therefore, they will destroy anything or anyone that hinders the realization of their ambitions. History has repeated this example time and time again for centuries. We only need to read some of the speeches of these rulers to fully understand what they intend for the new democracies. What crimes have the people of China, the people of the Soviet Union, and the people of the Eastern European democracies committed? They have established governments based on their own free choices, governments that have declared that their countries or their people will no longer be exploited to satisfy and fuel the desires of those unscrupulous financial capitalists who have treated the broad masses as beasts of burden for years. This is the extremely serious "crime" committed by those countries that only want the government they demand and no other form of government. How dare the people of China, the Soviet Union, and the new democracies of Eastern Europe refuse to accept a social system that takes the profit motive as its highest purpose? What right do they have to demand their own way of life? They must not only be taught a lesson, but must also serve as an example to warn those who have similar ideas and plan to follow their path. They must understand that the capitalist system is sacrosanct. They must be punished. Because capitalism cannot, and dare not, ignore the threat posed by the socialist planned economy. The achievements of the new democracies are becoming increasingly obvious to other countries in the world, and this threat is growing day by day. For this reason, these new democracies must be destroyed. According to the logical deduction of these reactionary forces, their policy must mean this, and nothing else.

    Therefore, I say that such a course of action is a crime against humanity, a crime that I, and millions of people like me, will never commit. On the one hand, to say to the 500 million Chinese people, "We are willing to establish trade relations with you, we are willing to give you a seat on the Security Council, and we are willing to treat you like brothers, but you must recognize Chiang Kai-shek as the ruler of your country," while on the other hand, to preach to them about individual freedom, is truly the greatest insult to them.

    Mr. Chairman, finally, I would like to talk about the following idea. The future belongs to the children. Our generation, and all of us who are participating in this conference, have a responsibility to our children and the great descendants yet to be born. We should do our best—even if our strength is very weak—to win the support of political parties, trade unions, all denominations of churches, all industries—in fact, all walks of life—to realize the only important cause in the world today—peace.

    Some people will say, what is the use of this? My answer to this is that there is something that every government in every country is afraid of, and that is public opinion. This explains why it is so important and necessary to mobilize all forces for peace as soon as possible. Because, as our opponents know very well, time is an important factor. If we grasp time tightly, it can be extremely beneficial to us. Public opinion has often not only changed government policies but has indeed changed the government itself.

    I said earlier that my home is in the East End of London. From 1940, at the beginning of the war, the East End of London suffered considerable damage from enemy attacks. In early 1945, Hitler was just beginning to use his latest secret weapon, the rockets or V2 long-range missiles. It is understandable that people who had been bombed by enemy aircraft for five long years were afraid of the use of this new weapon, for which there seemed to be no effective defense. Once, I was speaking at a meeting, and the audience gathered in the hall could clearly hear the monotonous explosion of these missiles. One of the audience members said to me, "Where are our secret weapons? What are we doing? We can only sit here and wait to be bombed. Why don't we think of a way ourselves?" I replied that we in Britain have a powerful secret weapon that is far superior to anything the enemy possesses, a weapon that Hitler would be willing to trade any weapon in his arsenal for. When he asked me again what this weapon was, I replied: "The will of a free people. This is the weapon that is enough to defeat all the armed forces of Hitler." The facts have proven this, and it has been proven for generations.

    With this will, anything is possible. Friends, comrades, brothers, the dark reactionary forces have begun to act with great fanfare. Be vigilant and be on guard against any form of propaganda and attack. Especially have the courage and determination, so that we will live to see the day when the great China and all Asian countries, proud of their national independence and autonomy, will take their rightful place in the International Peace Council, when mankind will be truly free, and peace can be established and maintained throughout the world.

    英国列席代表、英国工党党员约翰·伯恩斯
    在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议开幕式上的演词（摘要）
    主席先生：
    首先，让我对你允许我在这次伟大的会议上讲话表示感谢。其次，我还要向那些使我能够参加这次会议的人们表示感谢，我深切地意识到给予我的这份光荣。虽然我是英国工党党员和工会运动的一员，但我要首先声明，我是以个人身份到这里来的，我没有受到任何委托来代表英国工运的政治方面或产业方面讲话。我不用强调当我接到约我到北京来的邀请时那种万分兴奋的情绪。
    当我看到这个伟大会议，代表着那么多的国家，并听到许多代表团所遭遇到的企图阻止他们出席会议的种种艰难和障碍时——关于这一层，我将在以后再讲——我知道只有一个主题能够产生这样的大事情，这个主题我认为是今天世界上压倒一切的主题。我指的，自然是，世界和平的问题。每一个头脑清楚的人，不管他的肤色与信仰如何，也不管他属于任何政党或者根本无党无派，一定会体会到目前是具有凶兆的严重关头。同样地，他也会认识到任何一个不负责任的举动，就会点燃摧毁文化的火药库，这是今天我们都知道的事情。
    这个问题就是这样简单。因为这是一个生死存亡，有关世界上人类的生存与毁灭的问题。
    同样地真确的是，各国之间的和平的问题如能得到解决，那末自然而然地，由于消除了重整军备的需要，其他迫切的与亟待解决的问题，像对落后地区的援助，建立社会福利事业、医院、住屋、学校等等问题，也就会获得解决。
    我们谈到自由的时候，我一向主张不仅我自己要有自由，而且别的人也要有自由。我所指的自由不是仅限于个人的自由，而是最广义的，使一切国家都享有自治权和充分主权的自由。我很清楚全世界各处都有很多人和我采取同样坚定的看法。
    若干年来，这已经成了西方民主国家绝大多数的工人所公认的事实——那就是：他们的生活水准应该高于亚洲工人的生活水准。可是今天大家已经广泛地认识到：如果人类应该享有自己应得的权利的话，那他这种观念就是错误的。这种情形在道德上讲是错误的，那就是：有些人可以享受着尽可能高的生活水准，可以自由而充分地享用一切社会服务，不必为疾病、恤金、和年老退休而操心；而另
    一些人却仅仅由于居住地方的不同而必须挨受饥饿、愚昧、和疾病的痛苦。
    这样一个社会制度是极端不公平的，它规定一个人享受某一种生活水准，或者注定他享受另一种生活水准，并不是根据他现在的表现而是根据他原来的出身地。这一点，我已经说过，英国工人们越来越清楚地认识到了。我相信总会有一天，比较幸运的国家里的人民会接受这样一个事实，那就是：为了要提高比较不幸的国家里的兄弟们的生活，他们至少在各国人民间得到平等之前，要满足于他们现有的生活水平。究竟，这还是对双方有利的，因为只要一旦大家的生活水平相等了，两方面就可以一起前进了。
    梅纳德牧师已经把我准备在下一点讲的讲了，我现在只想把他讲的话加以强调。但是我愿加上一点，九月十四日有九千人在皇后大厅集会，这在一年前是不可能的。在英国发生的事情已唤醒人民的日益增长的警戒。
    是谁害怕和平呢？不是你们和我，也不是广大的人民群众。只有那些把不分种族和信仰的各国人民间更加紧密的关系看做是对他们保持经济势力的一种威胁的人们才害怕和平。他们会竭尽一切可能，千方百计地来分化世界上各个国家，并使它们处在分化的状态中。他们向来是，而且也永远会用残酷的手段来达到他们的目的。
    但是不管他们用何种手段，不管他们使用何种策略，世界仍然只有一个——只有一个完整的世界。假使人类想把世界分化成两个武装阵营，即使这样想法不过一秒钟之久，那也就完全等于自杀。在那些条件和那种情况下，进步实在是不可能的事。有了这样的环境，怎么会有自由呢？
    让我们说得更清楚一点。世界的经济统治者们只了解一种自由，那便是他们为自己的势力和赢利而去剥削人民群众的自由，因此任何妨碍他们的野心实现的任何事物或任何人，他们都要予以毁灭。多少世纪以来，历史一遍又一遍地重复着这种例子。我们只要读一些这样的统治者们的演说辞，就可以充分地了解他们对于新民主主义国家的打算是些什么了。中国人民、苏联人民和东欧民主主义国家的人民究竟犯了什么罪呢？他们根据自己的自由选择建立了政府，这些政府曾经宣告：它们的国家或它们的人民将不再受剥削以满足和助长那些多少年来把广大的人民群众当作牛马的肆无忌惮的金融资本家们的欲望。这便是那些只要自己所要求的政府而不要任何其他形式的政府的国家所犯下的极端严重的“罪状”。中国、苏联和东欧新民主主义国家的人民怎么居然敢拒绝接受一个以谋利的动机为最高目的的社会制度呢？他们有什么权利要求他们自己的生活方式呢？他们不仅应受一顿教训，而且必须作为一个榜样，以警诫那些具有类似思想并打算走他们的道路的人们。必须使他们懂得：资本主义制度是神圣不可侵犯的。他们必须受到处罚。因为资本主义不能，也不敢，对社会主义计划经济所造成的威胁置之不理。新民主主义国家的成就被世界上其它的国家看得越来越明显，这种威胁也就日益增大起来。为了这个原故，必须要摧毁这些新民主主义国家。按照这些反动势力的逻辑推论，它们的政策必然是这个意思，而不会是旁的意思。
    因此我说，这样的一种行动方针乃是一种违反人性的罪行，这种罪行是我，以及千百万像我一样的人们决不会犯的。一方面对着五万万中国人民说：“我们愿意和你们建立贸易关系呀，我们愿意在安全理事会里给你们一个席次呀，我们也愿意像兄弟般地对待你们呀，不过你们一定要承认蒋介石是你们国家的统治者”，同时另一方面还要对他们宣扬什么个人自由，这真是对他们的一个不能再大的侮辱。
    主席先生，最后，我愿意谈谈下面的意见。未来是属于儿童的。我们这一代以及所有我们参加这次会议的人，对我们的孩子们与还未出生的伟大的后代负有责任，我们应当尽心竭力——纵使我们的力量很微弱——去赢得政党、工会、所有教派的教会、各行业——实际上就是所有各界人士的支持，来实现今天世界上唯一重要的事业——和平。
    有些人会说，这有什么用呢？我对这个的回答是，有一种东西是每个国家的政府所害怕的，那就是舆论。这就说明了为什么尽早动员一切和平的力量是多么紧要与必需。因为正如我们的对方所深知，时间是一个重要的因素。如果我们紧紧掌握着时间，它便能极其有利地为我们所用。舆论在许多时候不但改变了政府的政策而且确乎改变了政府本身。
    我先前说过我的家是在伦敦的东区。从一九四○年起，在战争开始的时候，伦敦东区遭受敌人袭击的损失相当厉害。一九四五年初希特勒正开始使用他的最新的秘密武器，火箭或V2式长程飞弹。人民在受了长长五年敌机的轰炸以后，对这种好像没有有效的防御办法的新武器的使用表示恐惧，那是很可以理解的。有一次，我正在一个集会中演说，当时聚集在大厅里的听众都能很清楚地听见这些飞弹单调的爆炸声音。听众中有一个人向我说：“我们的秘密武器在那里？我们在做什么？我们只好坐在这里听候轰炸。为什么我们不自己想办法？”我回答说我们英国有一种远胜过敌人所有的强有力的秘密武器，这种武器是希特勒愿意拿它军械库中的任何一种武器来交换的。当他再问我这是什么武器的时候，我回答说：“自由人民的意志。这就是足以击败希特勒的一切武装力量的武器。”事实证明是如此，并且多少代一直都证明是如此。
    只要有了这种意志，什么事都可能做到。朋友们，同志们，兄弟们，黑暗的反动势力已经大张旗鼓地开始行动了。警惕并且戒备任何形式的宣传与攻击。尤其要有勇气和决心，这样，我们将活着看得到伟大的中国与所有亚洲国家一道，为它们国家的独立和自主而骄傲，在国际和平理事会中取得它们所应有的位置的那一天，那时人类会真正地自由，和平也就能在全世界建立起来并且得到维护。
