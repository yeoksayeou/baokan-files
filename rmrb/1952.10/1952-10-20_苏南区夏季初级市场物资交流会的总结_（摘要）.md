Summary of the Summer Primary Market Material Exchange Fair in the Southern Jiangsu District
中共苏南区党委

This summer, the Southern Jiangsu area carried out work on primary market material exchange. Fifty-one towns and cities across the district successively opened short-distance material exchange fairs in the form of primary markets. According to incomplete statistics, the total transaction value reached 250 billion yuan, with approximately 3 million people attending. Such a large-scale, mass-based economic activity with leadership and organization is unprecedented in the Southern Jiangsu area. Cadres from relevant organs and enterprises in various localities have further recognized the significant role of primary market material exchange fairs and have created some experiences in running successful primary market material exchange fairs.

The role played by the Southern Jiangsu District Summer Primary Market Exchange Fair is reflected in the following aspects:

First, it promoted material exchange, reversing and changing the spontaneous and stagnant situation of rural markets. Many small-scale local specialties and handicraft products in rural areas that were difficult to sell, such as Danyang umbrellas, Songjiang straw bags, Wuxian persimmon lacquer, Changshu abacuses, Kunshan hemp thread, etc., which could not find sales channels in higher-level, intermediate-level markets such as the East China level and Southern Jiangsu level, have found certain sales channels in short-distance exchanges in towns. The broad masses of farmers have purchased many industrial and handicraft products. Industrial product transactions generally account for about 35 percent of the total transaction value, which shows that the rural market is very broad, and the purchasing power of farmers is increasing day by day.

Second, it implemented the People's Government's policy of encouraging the private economy to engage in legitimate business, and it enhanced the operating enthusiasm of urban industrialists and merchants. In the previous period, many urban industrialists and merchants did not understand, or even misunderstood, the significance of the great "Five-Anti" movement, and their enthusiasm for engaging in legitimate business was not high. After the urban exchange fair, they experienced the policies of the People's Government and saw the facts of brisk sales and thriving business, thereby increasing their operating enthusiasm. Most of them expressed dissatisfaction with some people whose business styles were dishonest, who adhered to old rules, and who engaged in speculation and illegal activities, and some even educated these people, which is very good and necessary.

Third, it educated cadres and strengthened urban work. In the past, many cadres, especially grassroots cadres, did not pay attention to or even looked down upon commercial work. They mistakenly believed that "production is the main thing, and commerce is troublesome," and that "primary markets have few transactions to do." After these urban exchange fairs, many cadres personally participated in the leadership and practical work in this area and have initially experienced the importance of commercial work, beginning to realize that "increasing production must be closely combined with expanding exchange." Some places have already begun to equip urban work cadres, improve shop employee union organizations, and study the management of primary markets.

Fourth, and especially important, urban exchange fairs closely linked urban and rural production and sales work, playing a guiding role in production and operation. Many farmers sold agricultural products, by-products, and even scrap copper and broken iron at urban exchange fairs, turning "dead money into living money," and immediately purchased fertilizer, added agricultural tools, and invested in agricultural production. The exchange fair encouraged producers to improve the quality, specifications, and appropriately expand the production of certain marketable local specialties and handicraft products; for certain unsalable or less marketable products, the exchange fair guided producers to switch to other industries or reduce production, gradually guiding them to change their operating direction.

What experiences did the Southern Jiangsu District Summer Primary Market Exchange Fair gain? In summary, there are the following points:

First, it is necessary to raise awareness and strengthen leadership. Transforming old-fashioned, decentralized, spontaneous markets into new-style, led, and organized markets is an extremely complex and meticulous task, and it is impossible to do well without the attention and leadership of the responsible Party and government cadres. The success and scale of the summer exchange fairs in each town were directly proportional to the degree of importance attached and the depth of work of the local Party and government leading cadres. The exchange fair that was run better in a town was certainly because the county and district cadres there paid more attention to commercial work, earnestly implemented the instructions and policies of the higher authorities, and criticized certain erroneous ideas that hindered material exchange work. Conversely, it was certainly because the county and district cadres there did not have enough understanding of the importance and complexity of the primary market and did not conduct ideological leadership for cadres and the masses. Generally speaking, many cadres, especially district and township cadres, still do not fully appreciate and understand the significance of closely combining increased production with expanded material exchange, as well as the important form of this new democratic commercial activity; they do not understand or do not fully understand the importance and regularity of material exchange work, so they have not been able to effectively strengthen the leadership of commercial work. They still do not understand or do not fully understand that holding urban exchange fairs is an important method to broadly unite and educate industrialists and merchants, so that they can serve production and the people well. Therefore, some comrades mistakenly adopted some "rather left than right" methods to artificially restrict material exchange; others relaxed or abandoned the leadership of private industrialists and merchants, and even had the erroneous idea of simply accommodating and unconditionally compromising. These "left" or right-leaning ideological tendencies are all harmful to material exchange work.

Second, it is necessary to conduct investigation and research in advance according to economic zoning and make a good material exchange plan. Primary market exchange fairs must focus on exchanges within the original economic zone and consciously strive for external exchanges. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct in-depth investigation and research on the production and sales situation within its original economic zone and the needs of farmers in production and life to grasp the relevant regional, seasonal, and other characteristics of the primary market in each town, strengthen planning, and avoid blindness. The reason why the exchange fairs in some towns were run better is because the leadership convened them according to the original economic zone, and conducted investigations and research in advance on the economic situation, the production and sales of major products, the needs and purchasing power of farmers, the changes in public and private economic forces and the relationship between public and public, and the relationship between public and private since liberation, basically clarifying the situation, and then formulating a plan, soliciting mass opinions during propaganda and mobilization, and making revisions. The reason why the exchange fairs in some towns were not run well is because the leadership did not grasp the characteristics of primary market exchange fairs and did not understand the role of primary market exchange fairs.

Third, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses and meticulously organize forces. Urban and rural material exchange fairs are closely related to the interests of producers, consumers, and vendors. Therefore, it is necessary to lead and mobilize people from all walks of life and unite and organize forces from all aspects to carry out material exchange work. Many town exchange fairs generally pay more attention to mobilizing industrial and commercial circles and farmers to participate, but they have done a very poor job in mobilizing and relying on the strength of urban workers. In the summer exchange work, the more successful in mobilizing the masses and organizing forces was to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life through people's representative conferences and original mass organizations; taking the government, industrial and commercial departments, and cooperatives as the backbone, absorbing representatives from industrial and commercial circles and all walks of life to jointly plan, and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of industrial and commercial circles and all walks of life, so as to better lead and promote this aspect of work. Some places have begun to mobilize and organize town shop employees and handicraft workers through exchange fairs, relying on them to unite industrialists and merchants to actively participate in exchanges, so that industrialists and merchants engage in legitimate business and improve their business style, which has achieved good results.

Fourth, it is necessary to do a good job in the various business preparations of relevant departments and correctly implement the Party and the People's Government's principles and policies on primary market material exchange.

Since the primary market is oriented towards rural areas, and more than 90 percent of the transactions are realized to the peasant masses, the exchange policy of the primary market should focus on retail business. The state-owned economy should closely contact cooperatives and play a leading role in regulating supply and demand and stabilizing prices. The tax department should correctly implement the tax policy to ensure state revenue. The People's Bank must firmly grasp the policy of loans to prevent blind loans and the phenomenon of not lending when they should. Some town exchange fairs have implemented the above-mentioned principles and policies, unified the thinking and pace of the various relevant departments, and carefully checked and solved the problems existing in the relationship between public and public and between public and private in the pre-meeting preparation work, so the exchange fair was run very well, and the market situation after the meeting was also better. Conversely, some places did not do this well, and not only did many problems occur during the meeting, but also many problems occurred after the meeting. In material exchange work, it is necessary to correctly treat private commerce, both to give play to their enthusiasm for legitimate business, encourage them to increase capital and expand operations; and to prevent and ban their possible illegal activities.

Fifth, combining material exchange and doing a good job in propaganda and education is also an important task in running a good exchange fair. The propaganda and education work in various places during the exchange fair is generally done well. In many towns, in the exchange fair, combined with the current central work of the locality, various exhibitions were held, and publicity activities such as dramas and broadcasts that were popular with the masses were organized. These cultural and entertainment activities not only attracted many people to participate in material exchanges but also played their due role in educating the masses and guiding production. The shortcomings are mainly that the propaganda and education work before and after the meeting is not done well enough, and there is even a bias towards chaotic propaganda before the meeting and no propaganda after the meeting. Some places do not conduct positive ideological education to different objects through original mass organizations, but rather engage in unrealistic and chaotic propaganda: some promote "80% off for buying things at the exchange fair, and 10% more for selling things," etc., but the fact is not like that. There are also those who have not been able to make propaganda work well serve material exchange, and there are situations where it is completely divorced from the current central work in rural areas, which is not good.

Sixth, consolidating the achievements of the exchange fair and strengthening the regular leadership of urban work and primary markets. Some counties and districts have conducted inspections and summaries after opening the exchange fair, and some business departments have also begun to conduct policy inspections and work summaries, which is very necessary. Only by earnestly conducting inspections and summaries, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and correcting the shortcomings in the implementation of policies can we improve the ideological and business levels of cadres and consolidate and develop the achievements that have been made. Not only should inspections and summaries be conducted in departments directly related to business, but also in people's organizations, especially in industrial and commercial circles, to achieve the purpose of raising awareness, improving relations, and improving management. For some problems related to production and exchange found in the exchange fair, appropriate cadres should also be assigned to continue to conduct investigations and research and correctly lead and solve them. Some comrades think that everything is "all right" after the exchange fair, and even become complacent, which must be educated and corrected.

    苏南区夏季初级市场物资交流会的总结  （摘要）
    中共苏南区党委
    今年夏季，苏南地区开展了初级市场物资交流的工作。全区有五十一个城镇先后开了初级市场形式的短距离的物资交流会，据不完整的统计，交易总额共达二千五百亿元，到会群众约计三百余万人。像这样有领导、有组织的大规模的群众性经济活动，在苏南地区还是创举。各地有关机关、企业的干部，进一步认识了初级市场物资交流会的重大作用，创造了若干开好初级市场物资交流会的经验。
    苏南区夏季初级市场交流会所起的作用，表现在如下几方面：
    第一、促进了物资交流，扭转和改变了农村市场的自流现象与呆滞情况。农村中许多小宗的土特产和手工业滞销品，如丹阳的雨伞、松江的草包、吴县的柿漆、常熟的算盘、崐山的麻线等等，在华东一级及苏南一级等高级、中级市场形式的交流会中没有找到销路的，在城镇短距离的交流中，已找到了一定的销路。广大农民群众购买了不少工业品和手工业品。工业品交易一般占交易总额的百分之三十五左右，这就说明农村市场十分宽广，农民购买力已日益提高。
    第二、贯彻了人民政府鼓励私营经济从事正当经营的政策，提高了城镇工商业者的经营积极性。许多市镇工商业者，在前一时期，对伟大的“五反”运动的意义是不了解甚至有误解的，他们从事正当经营的积极性是不高的。经过城镇交流会后，他们体验到了人民政府的政策，看到了货物畅销、生意兴旺的事实，因而提高了经营积极性。他们之中的大多数，对于有些经营作风不老实的、墨守陋规、投机不法的人表示不满，有的还对这些人进行了教育，这是很好的，非常必要的。
    第三、教育了干部，加强了市镇工作。过去有不少干部，特别是基层干部，他们是不重视甚至轻视商业工作的，他们错误地认为“生产是正事，商业是多事”，认为“初级市场没有几笔买卖可做”。经过这些城镇的交流会，很多干部亲自参加了这一方面的领导和实际工作后，已经初步体验到商业工作的重要性，开始认识到“增加生产必须与扩大交流密切结合”。有些地方已经开始配备市镇工作干部，健全店员工会组织，学习对初级市场的经营管理工作。
    第四、特别重要的是，城镇交流会密切地把城乡产销工作联系起来，发挥了指导生产和指导经营的作用。许多农民在城镇交流会售出了农产品、副产品以至废铜烂铁，把“死钱变成活钱”后，立即购买肥料，添置农具，投资于农业生产。交流会鼓励生产者提高某些有销路的土特产品及手工业品的质量，改善规格，适当地扩大生产；对某些无销路的或销路不大的产品，交流会指导生产者转业或减少生产，逐步地引导他们改变经营方向。
    苏南区夏季初级市场交流会获得了些什么经验呢？综合起来，有如下几点：
    第一、必须提高认识，加强领导。把旧式的分散自流的市场，改造成为新式的有领导有组织的市场，是一件极其复杂而细致的工作，没有当地党、政负责干部的重视和领导，是不可能做好的。各个城镇夏季交流会开得成功与否和成就大小，都是和当地党政领导干部重视与否、工作深入与否成正比例的。那个城镇的交流会开得比较好，一定是因为那里的县区干部比较重视商业工作，认真执行了上级的政策指示，并对某些阻碍物资交流工作的错误思想进行了批判。反之，一定是因为那里的县区干部对初级市场的重要性和复杂性认识不足，没有对干部和群众进行思想领导。一般地说，很多干部，特别是区乡干部，他们对增加生产和扩大物资交流必须密切结合的意义，以及对这种新民主主义商业活动的重要形式还是体会和理解得不够的；他们不了解或不完全了解物资交流工作的重要性和经常性，因此还未能切实加强对商业工作的领导。他们还不了解或不完全了解召开城镇交流会，是广泛地团结与教育工商业者，使他们好好地为生产为人民服务的重要方法。因此，有些同志错误地采取了某些“宁左勿右”的办法，对物资交流加以人为的束缚；有的则放松或放弃了对私营工商业的领导，甚至存在单纯照顾和无原则迁就的错误思想。这些“左”的或右的思想倾向，都是对物资交流工作有害的。
    第二、必须按照经济区划，事前进行调查研究，作好物资交流计划。初级市场交流会必须以当地原来的经济区划内的交流为主，并有意识地争取对外交流。因此，必须就其原来的经济区划内的产销情况，和农民群众生产、生活上的需要，进行深入的调查研究，以掌握各该城镇初级市场的有关地区性的、季节性的等等特点，加强计划性，避免盲目性。有些城镇的交流会所以开得比较好，就是因为领导方面是按照原有的经济区划召开的，而且对各该经济区划内的经济情况、主要物产的产销情况、农民的需要和购买力、解放以来公私经济力量变化和公公关系、公私关系等，事先都作了调查研究，基本上摸清了情况，然后拟订计划，在进行宣传动员时，征求群众意见，加以修正。有些城镇交流会之所以开得不好，就是因为领导方面没有掌握初级市场交流会的特点，没有懂得初级市场交流会的作用。
    第三、必须充分发动群众，周密组织力量。城乡物资交流会是和生产者、消费者、贩卖者的利益密切相关的。因此，必须领导和发动各界人民，统一组织各方面的力量来进行物资交流工作。许多城镇的交流会对于发动工商界和农民群众参加，一般是比较注意的，但对于发动并依靠城镇职工的力量，则做得很差。在夏季交流工作中，在发动群众、组织力量方面做得比较成功的，是通过各界人民代表会议和原有群众组织，充分发动各界人民的积极性；以政府、工商部门和合作社为骨干，吸收工商界和各界代表人物共同筹划，充分发动工商界和各界人民的积极性，以便更好地领导和推动这一方面的工作。有的地方开始通过交流会把市镇店员工人、手工业工人发动和组织起来，依靠他们去团结工商业者积极参加交流，使工商业者从事正当经营和改善经营作风，得到了良好的效果。
    第四、必须做好有关部门的各项业务准备，正确贯彻党和人民政府对初级市场物资交流的方针政策。
    由于初级市场面向农村，百分之九十以上的交易是对农民群众实现的，因此，初级市场的交流方针应以零售业务为主。国营经济要密切联系合作社，在调节供求、稳定物价等方面发挥领导作用。税务部门要正确贯彻税务政策，保证国家税收。人民银行要切实掌握贷款的方针，防止盲目贷款和该贷不贷的现象发生。有些城镇交流会贯彻执行了上述方针政策，统一了各有关部门的思想和步调，在会前准备工作中，认真检查并解决了公与公和公与私关系上所存在的问题，因此，交流会就开得很好，会后的市场情况也比较好。反之，有些地方没有很好地这样做，不但开会期间发生了不少问题，而且会后的问题也很多。在物资交流工作中，要正确地对待私营商业，既要发挥他们正当经营的积极性，鼓励他们增加资本，扩展经营；又要防止和取缔他们可能发生的不法行为。
    第五、结合物资交流，做好宣传教育工作，也是开好交流会的一项重要工作。各地在交流会期间的宣传教育工作一般是做得好的。很多城镇在交流会中，结合当地当前中心工作，举行各种展览会，组织为群众喜闻乐见的戏剧、广播等宣传活动。这些文化娱乐活动不但吸引了许多群众前来参加物资交流，而且起了应有的教育群众和指导生产的作用。其缺点，主要是会前和会后的宣传教育工作做得不够，甚至存在会前乱宣传，会后不宣传的偏向。有些地方不是通过原有群众组织，分别对象，进行正面的思想教育，而是不切实际地乱宣传：有的宣传“交流会买东西打八折、卖东西加一成”等等，而事实却并不是这样。也有的没有能使宣传工作很好地为物资交流服务，有和当前农村中心工作完全脱节的情形，这都是不好的。
    第六、巩固交流会的成果，加强城镇工作和初级市场的经常领导。有些县区在开了交流会以后，进行检查总结，有些业务部门也已开始进行政策检查和工作总结，这是很必要的。只有认真地进行检查总结，开展批评与自我批评，纠正执行政策中的缺点，才能提高干部思想水平和业务水平，巩固和发展已得的成果。不但在业务直接有关部门中要进行检查总结，而且在人民团体中，特别是在工商界中，也要很好地进行检查总结，以达到提高认识、改善关系、改善经营的目的。对于交流会中所发现的有关生产和交流中的一些问题，还应该配备适当干部，继续进行调查研究，正确地加以领导解决。有些同志以为开过交流会就已“万事大吉”，甚至自满起来，这是必须教育纠正的。
