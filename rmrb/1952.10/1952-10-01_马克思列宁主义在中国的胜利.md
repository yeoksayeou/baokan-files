    The Victory of Marxism-Leninism in China
    Chairman of the Jiusan Society
    Xu Deheng

    I.

    Although only three years have passed since the founding of New China, its achievements in various fields are far beyond what words can describe.

    As the people of New China, living in a happy environment, and seeing or hearing every day about admirable figures and moving events, we have become accustomed to the countless new things emerging before our eyes. This is human nature. However, a foreign traveler, as soon as he steps into the gate of China, even with a brief glimpse, can discover that new history is being created, and there is a powerful force driving the wheels of history forward. Here, we can take the American peace lover Mr. Kingsbury as an example. He only stayed in China for a month, but according to him: "What I saw and heard in China was like a dream, otherwise, one would think he had arrived in a new world." (Kingsbury: "Impressions of New China and a Glimpse of Siberia," People's Daily, September 25). What power has enabled China to produce such tremendous changes in just three years?

    Indeed, our achievements in the past three years are too numerous to mention.

    First of all, on the Korean War to Resist U.S. Aggression front, together with the Korean People's Army, we defeated the frantic attacks of the invading armies of U.S. imperialism and its vassal states. From October of the year before last to the end of August this year alone, we have annihilated more than 600,000 enemies, of which more than 270,000 were U.S. aggressor troops. U.S. imperialism vainly attempted to make a fortune in the Korean War, but on the Korean battlefield, it has invested one-half of its total force and one-third of its air force, mobilized more than 1.5 million troops, and spent more than 20 billion U.S. dollars in military expenses, resulting in a complete mess, forcing it to sit down for armistice negotiations. In the negotiations, U.S. imperialism exhausted its rogue tactics, and finally even resorted to mice and fleas, vainly attempting to use this unheard-of "military pressure" to make the Chinese and Korean People's forces yield. But history has long judged that the failure of this unpopular war of aggression by U.S. imperialism is doomed. It can never escape the judgment of justice. We have not only strengthened ourselves in the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement and promoted various construction undertakings in our motherland, but also continuously inflicted heavy blows on the enemy militarily. At the same time, the just actions of the Chinese people have won the enthusiastic support of the people of the world, thereby expanding the further unity of the Chinese people with the working people of all countries.

    On various domestic fronts, our achievements in the past three years have been truly brilliant. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, we have completed land reform in areas with a population of 428 million agricultural people in a planned and step-by-step manner. At present, except for a small number of minority areas where land reform is temporarily not being implemented, the national land reform work can be fully completed this winter and next spring. We have vigorously carried out the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, annihilated bandit armed forces, basically eliminated all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship.

    In the past three years, the construction of the people's democratic power and economic construction have also achieved great results. In the country’s thirty provinces, two provincial-level administrative regions, one hundred and sixty cities, two thousand one hundred and seventy-four counties, and approximately two hundred and eighty thousand villages, not only have people's governments been established, but people's representative conferences have also been convened. In the minority areas, one hundred and thirty autonomous regions have been established. Because the people directly participate in the government and exercise management and supervision over state affairs, this has greatly promoted the patriotism of the people and promoted the advancement of various state undertakings. The fundamental improvement of the financial and economic situation is an even greater event that deserves the jubilation of the people of the whole country. The mess left by the Kuomintang reactionary government, in just three years, the industrial and agricultural production of New China has not only been restored to pre-war levels, but some have even exceeded the highest levels in Chinese history. Financial revenue and expenditure have been completely balanced, and construction funds have been elevated to the first place. Prices have been comprehensively stabilized. Social purchasing power has increased, and the people's lives have been improving day by day.

    The ideological remolding movement and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have played an extremely important role in promoting various national construction works, reforming social customs, and raising the political awareness and work level of the people of the whole country, while also paving the way for future democratic reforms and large-scale economic construction throughout the country in all aspects.

    The reform of education, including the school system reform that began last October and the adjustment of departments and faculties in higher education institutions this year, must be considered a major achievement of the ideological remolding movement (including the teachers' study movement). Without the vigorous ideological remolding movement, without correcting the understanding of teachers and students at all levels of schools in the ideological remolding study, it would have been more difficult to successfully carry out and complete these two major reforms in education. And these two major reforms have provided favorable conditions for the development of education in New China and for welcoming large-scale economic construction.

    In order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, a vigorous judicial reform movement is being carried out throughout the country to eliminate old legal viewpoints and styles, transform the thinking of legal workers, establish a Marxist-Leninist, Mao Zedong Thought's view of the state and the law, and reform the entire people's judicial system. Now this movement has initially achieved great results in various regions, clearing out a group of bad elements who have violated laws and disciplines and are deeply entrenched in bad habits and are beyond redemption, and educated the vast number of judicial workers, thereby basically cleaning up and strengthening the judicial organs at all levels, and creating new systems and new styles that closely connect with the masses.

    All these countless brilliant achievements have never appeared in any period of Chinese history, nor could they have appeared.

    II.

    Internationally, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "Our nation will no longer be a nation insulted by others, we have stood up. Our revolution has won the sympathy and cheers of the broad masses of the people of the world, and our friends are all over the world." This is because truth and justice are on our side, and our demands are in line with the interests of all mankind.

    Our revolution has first and foremost received the consistent support of the Soviet people. From the era of Lenin, this great revolutionary mentor greeted the "Asian Storm" with the greatest enthusiasm and called on the Russian proletariat to "watch the success of the Chinese revolutionary people with sincere excitement and full sympathy." Later, under the leadership of Marshal Stalin, the Soviet Union continued to provide sincere and selfless assistance to the Chinese people's revolutionary movement. In the past, the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people was constantly obstructed by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Since the Chinese revolution achieved a decisive victory and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was overthrown, the friendship and cooperation between the two peoples can be developed and consolidated without limit. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance on February 14, 1950, and the agreement reached by the representatives of China and the Soviet Union on September 15 this year regarding the Soviet Union's transfer of the Changchun Railway to our country and the extension of the term for the joint use of the Lushunkou Naval Base prove that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is constantly developing and strengthening, and this unbreakable friendship will play an unparalleled force in the struggle to defend peace and democracy.

    The working people of the world also watched with great concern and cheered the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. They unanimously pointed out that the victory of the Chinese people is inseparable from their struggle. The victory of the Chinese people is also their victory. The liberation movements of the oppressed nations in Asia have taken the struggle of the Chinese people as their example, and they will move forward along the path of the Chinese people, that is, the path of Mao Zedong.

    Now, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, initiated by famous Chinese peace figures, is about to be held in our capital. This is undoubtedly a great encouragement to the Chinese people who stand at the forefront of the struggle to defend peace. Our friends are all over the world! China is no longer an oppressed and humiliated country. The era when imperialism vainly attempted to dominate the Chinese people and even the Asian people is gone forever.

    If the imperialists do not see these forces, do not estimate these forces to the extent they should, let them suffer. The wheels of history cannot be reversed.

    III.

    Chairman Mao said: "Before the October Revolution, the Chinese people did not know Lenin and Stalin, nor did they know Marx and Engels. The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." He also said: "The Chinese people have found Marxism-Leninism, this universal truth that applies everywhere, and the face of China has changed." Obviously, the theory of Marxism-Leninism that the Russian October Revolution brought us is the most fundamental weapon for the Chinese people to defeat the enemy and achieve revolutionary victory, and it is the source of power for the Chinese revolutionary movement.

    It must be further pointed out that the reason why Marxism-Leninism has produced such infinite power in the Chinese revolutionary movement is because Chairman Mao, a loyal believer in Marxism-Leninism, correctly and vividly combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, making it the power of the masses; it is because he solved a series of problems in the Chinese revolution, thus guiding the victory of the Chinese people's revolution.

    Therefore, we can conclude that the victory of the Chinese revolution is the victory of Marxism-Leninism, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    In the past three years, New China has achieved many great achievements, which are inseparable from Marxism-Leninism and from the correct leadership of Chairman Mao.

    Therefore, when we celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of New China, we must cheer for the great victory of Marxism-Leninism and cheer for the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

    We, the cultural, educational, and scientific workers of New China, in order to do our work well and serve the people and the construction of the motherland more effectively, must strive to arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism, use Marxism-Leninism to transform our thinking, and improve our work level. We, as members of democratic parties, must strive to study Marxism-Leninism, and under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, strive to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, thoroughly realize the Common Program, and complete the national construction tasks. This is a clear direction of our efforts in commemorating the third anniversary of the founding of New China. Finally, let us shout:

    Long live the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China and the world!

    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong!

    Long live the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    Eve of National Day, 1952.

    马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利
    九三学社主席
    许德珩
    一
    新中国成立到现在虽然仅仅三周年，但它在各方面的成就，则远非笔墨所能尽述。
    作为一个新中国的人民，因为生活在幸福的环境中，每天所看到的或听到的，尽是些可敬的人物和动人的事例，因而对于涌现在眼前的无数的新事物，也就觉得“司空见惯”。这原是人情之常。但是
    一个外来的旅行者，只要他踏进了中国的大门，即使是短短的一瞥，他就可以发现新的历史正在创造，而且有一股强大的力量，推动着历史的车轮前进。在这里，我们可以以美国的和平爱好者金斯伯利先生为例。他在中国只耽搁了一个月，可是据他所说：“在中国所见所闻宛如幻梦，不然的话，一个人一定会以为他是到了一个新世界。”（金斯伯利：“新中国印象与西伯利亚一瞥”，载九月二十五日人民日报）是什么力量使中国在短短的三年间
    产生这样巨大的变化呢？
    实在，三年来我们的成就真是说也说不完的。
    首先，我们在抗美援朝战线上，和朝鲜人民军一道，打败了美帝国主义及其仆从国家侵略军队的疯狂进攻，仅从前年十月到今年八月底上，我们已歼灭了敌人六十万人以上，其中美国侵略军占二十七万人以上。美帝国主义妄想在侵朝战争中发一笔财，可是在朝鲜战场上已使它投入全部兵力的二分之一和空军的三分之一，动用兵力一百五十多万，化费军费二百多亿美元，结果被打得焦头烂额，迫使它不得不坐下来举行停战谈判。在谈判中，美帝国主义又耍尽了无赖手腕，最后甚至乞灵于耗子和跳蚤，妄想以这个闻所未闻的“军事压力”来使中朝人民部队屈膝。但历史早已判明，美帝国主义这种失尽人心的侵略战争的失败是注定了的，它绝对逃不了正义的裁判，而我们不但在抗美援朝运动中壮大了自己，推动了祖国各种建设事业，在军事上继续不断地给敌人以沉重的打击，同时中国人民的正义行动博得了全世界人民的热烈支持，从而扩大了中国人民与各国劳动人民的进一步的团结。
    在国内各个战线上，三年来我们的成就真是光芒万丈的。我们在中央人民政府领导之下，有计划、有步骤地完成了四亿二千八百万农业人口地区的土地改革。目前除了一小部分少数民族地区暂不实行土地改革外，全国土地改革工作今冬和明春就可全部完成。我们大张旗鼓地进行了镇压反革命运动，歼灭了土匪武装，基本消灭了一切暗藏的反革命分子，巩固了人民民主专政。
    三年来，人民民主政权建设和经济建设也获得了很大的成绩。全国三十个省、二个省级行署区、一百六十个市、二千一百七十四个县和约二十八万余个乡，不仅建立了人民政府，而且都召开了人民代表会议。在少数民族地区，已经建立民族自治区的有一百三十个。由于人民直接参加了政权，对国家事务实行管理和监督，这就大大地发挥了人民的爱国主义精神，推动了国家各种事业的前进。财政经济状况的根本好转，更是值得全国人民欢欣鼓舞的
    一件大事。国民党反动政府所遗留下来的一个烂摊子，在短短的三年间，新中国工农业生产不但已经恢复到战前水平，而且有的已经超过中国历史上的最高水平。财政收支已完全平衡，建设经费且被提高到第一位。物价全面稳定。社会购买力提高，人民生活日益改善。
    思想改造运动和“三反”、“五反”运动，对于推进国家各种建设工作，改革社会风气，提高全国人民的政治认识和工作水平，起了极其重大的作用，同时为今后全国在各方面实行民主改革和进行大规模经济建设铺平了道路。
    教育事业的改革，其中包括去年十月开始的学制改革和今年进行的高等学校院系调整，不能不认为是思想改造运动（包括教师学习运动）的重大成就。没有轰轰烈烈的思想改造运动，没有在思想改造的学习中端正各级学校教师和学生的认识，要胜利地进行并完成教育事业上这两大改革，是比较困难的。而这两大改革，又为发展新中国的教育和迎接大规模的经济建设提供了有利的条件。
    为了巩固人民民主专政，全国正展开一个轰轰烈烈的司法改革运动，以肃清旧法观点与作风，改造法律工作人员的思想，建立马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的国家观、法律观、改革整个人民司法机构。现在这个运动已在各地区初步获得了很大的成绩，清除了一批违法乱纪和恶习甚深不堪改造的坏分子，教育了广大的司法工作者，从而基本清理了并健全了各级司法机构，创造了密切联系群众的新制度和新作风。
    这一切数不完的辉煌的成就，都是中国历史上任何时期从未出现，也不可能出现的。
    二
    在国际上正如毛主席所指出：“我们的民族将再也不是一个被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站起来了。我们的革命已经获得全世界广大人民的同情和欢呼，我们的朋友遍于全世界。”这是因为真理和正义是在我们这方面，我们的要求和全世界人类的利益是一致的。
    我们的革命，首先获得苏联人民的一贯支持。从列宁的时代起，这个伟大的革命导师就以最大的热情欢呼“亚洲的风暴”，并号召俄国无产阶级“以衷诚的兴奋和充分的同情注视中国革命人民底成功”。以后，在斯大林大元帅领导之下，苏联又不断地给中国人民的革命运动以真诚无私的援助。在过去，中苏两国人民友谊曾受到帝国主义和国民党反动派的不断阻挠，自从中国革命取得决定的胜利，国民党反动统治被推翻之后，两国人民的友谊和合作，可以无限量地发展和巩固起来了。一九五○年二月十四日中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订以及今年九月十五日中苏两国代表谈判关于苏联将长春铁路移交我国和延长共同使用旅顺口海军根据地的期限所达成的协议，证明了中苏两国人民友谊是不断发展和加强的，而这种牢不可破的友谊，在保卫和平与民主的斗争中，将发挥无可比拟的力量。
    全世界劳动人民也以极大的关怀注视并欢呼中国人民革命的胜利。他们一致指出：中国人民的胜利，和他们的斗争是分不开的。中国人民的胜利也就是他们的胜利。亚洲各被压迫民族的解放运动更以中国人民的斗争为他们的榜样，他们将循着中国人民的道路，即毛泽东的道路迈步前进。
    现在，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，在中国著名和平人士发起之下，即将在我国首都举行。这对于站在保卫和平斗争最前列的中国人民，无疑的是一个极大的鼓舞。我们的朋友遍于全世界！中国不再是一个被压迫被屈辱的国家了，帝国主义妄想在中国人民乃至亚洲人民面前称王称霸的时代已一去不复返了。
    帝国主义者如果看不到这些力量，不以应有的程度估计到这些力量，就让他们去吃苦吧。历史的车轮是无法扭转的。
    三
    毛主席说过：“在十月革命以前，中国人不但不知道列宁、斯大林，也不知道马克思、恩格斯。十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。”又说：“中国人找到了马克思列宁主义这个放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，中国的面目就起了变化了。”显然，由俄国十月革命给我们送来的马克思列宁主义的理论，乃是中国人民用以战胜敌人、取得革命胜利的最根本的武器，乃是中国革命运动的力量之泉源。
    必须进一步指出：马克思列宁主义之所以在中国革命运动中产生了如此无穷的力量，是由于马克思列宁主义的忠实信徒毛主席正确地和生动地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践结合起来，使之成为大众的力量；是由于他解决了中国革命中一系列的问题，因而指导了中国人民革命的胜利。
    因此，我们可以得出结论说：中国革命的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    三年来，新中国获得许多伟大的成就，是和马克思列宁主义分不开的，是和毛主席的正确领导分不开的。
    因此，当我们庆祝新中国成立三周年的时候，我们要为马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利而欢呼，为毛泽东思想的伟大胜利而欢呼！
    我们，新中国的文教科学工作者，为了搞好我们的工作，更有效地为人民大众和祖国的建设服务，就必须努力以马克思列宁主义武装自己，用马克思列宁主义来改造我们的思想，提高我们的工作水平。我们，作为民主党派的成员，就必须努力学习马克思列宁主义，在马克思列宁主义指导之下，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，为巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，彻底实现共同纲领和完成国家建设任务而努力。这是我们在纪念新中国成立三周年的时候应明确的一个努力方向。最后，让我们高呼：
    马克思列宁主义在中国和全世界的胜利万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营万岁！
    一九五二、国庆前夕。
