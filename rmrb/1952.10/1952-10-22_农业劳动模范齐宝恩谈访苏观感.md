    Agricultural Labor Model Qi Baoen Talks About His Impressions of Visiting the Soviet Union
    To the Editor: I am a member of the "Chinese Farmers' Representative Visiting Group" who recently returned to the motherland from the Soviet Union. The things I saw and heard in the Soviet Union for four months, I will never forget.
    The love of the Soviet people for the Chinese people cannot be expressed in words. On April 27th, when we first arrived in Moscow, many Soviet comrades came to greet us in person. On "May Day," we stood on the reviewing platform, and the marching teams all paid their respects to us. A team of farmers came to us, vying to offer flowers and shake hands, shouting "Long live!" Later, when our train traveled in the Soviet Union, we were warmly surrounded by the local people when we got on and off the train. Once, the train was already moving, and an old lady barely squeezed out of the crowd, running after the train while shaking hands with us. Another time, we came back from a visit to wash our faces with water, and an old lady rushed to fetch water for us. Our representative from the Northwest District, Old Hu, hurriedly went to take the water and called her "Mama." Through translation, the old lady was so moved that she shed tears when she heard this. She said, "The Chinese and Soviet people are really brothers!"
    In the Soviet Union, labor has become the noblest and most joyful thing. This is partly because of the high political consciousness of the people and partly because they have created various conditions that facilitate production. In the Soviet Union, there are no natural disasters that cannot be overcome. I visited the "Cossack Communism" Collective Farm. In the past, after the spring snow melted every year, only a little grass could grow there to feed the livestock, followed by three months without a drop of rain. Such a dry area would be impossible to cultivate in our country. But in the Soviet Union, not only can it be cultivated, but there are also bumper harvests every year.
    The lives of the Soviet people are truly happy and prosperous. When I was in Moscow, I thought this was just a phenomenon of the capital, but when I went to the countryside, I found that the members of the collective farms also lived well. Every family lived in Western-style houses, furnished with carpets, wire beds, radios, etc. Some even had pianos. Every family ate sugar, milk, and fruit bread. Sorghum, millet, and brown rice were used to feed livestock. They were even more particular about their clothes. Members with particularly good economic conditions even had their own cars. After a day's work, they read books, sang, and danced, and their lives were very joyful.
    Before visiting the Soviet Union, I had many muddled ideas about socialist society. Bad people spread rumors that everything in the Soviet Union was publicly owned, everyone ate from the same pot, and even children did not recognize their own parents. I was half-convinced. Now this kind of erroneous thinking has been swept away. I have seen with my own eyes that the Soviet Union is a society where everyone does their best, remuneration is based on labor, and more work means more pay. Members can not only have abundant consumer goods, but also vegetable gardens, fruit trees, and poultry. The family life of the Soviet people is the most fulfilling.
    All this is due to the leadership of the Communist Party. Now that I have returned to the motherland, I am determined to run the agricultural production cooperative I participate in well, promote the whole village to take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, and move forward under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    农业劳动模范齐宝恩谈访苏观感
    编辑同志：我是才从苏联回到祖国不久的“中国农民代表参观团”的一个团员。在苏联四个月，所见所闻，我永远不会忘记。
    苏联人民对中国人民的热爱，真不是言语能够表达的。四月二十七日，当我们刚一到莫斯科时，苏联很多同志就亲自来迎接。“五一”节我们站在观礼台上，游行队伍都向我们致敬，一队农民队伍走到我们面前，抢着献花、握手，高声叫着“万岁”。以后，我们乘坐的火车在苏联境内行驶，下车上车，都受到当地人民的热情包围。有一次火车已走动，一位老大娘好容易才从人丛中挤出来，一面跟着火车跑，一面还和我们握手。还有一次，我们参观回来，取水洗脸，一位老大娘抢着给我们打水；我们西北区的代表老胡慌忙去接水，叫她“妈妈”，通过翻译，老大娘一听，感动得淌了泪，她说：“中苏两国人民真是亲兄弟啊！”
    在苏联，劳动已经成为最高尚最愉快的事。这一方面是由于人民的政治觉悟高，一方面是由于他们自己创造了各种便利生产的条件。在苏联，现在已经没有克服不了的自然灾害。我曾到“哥萨克共产主义”集体农庄去参观，在过去，那地方每年春雪融化以后，只能生一点青草，供牲口吃，接着就是三个月不下一滴雨。像这样干旱的地区，在我国是没法耕作的。但在苏联，不仅能耕种，还年年丰收。
    苏联人民的生活真是幸福，日子过的非常富裕。我在莫斯科时，还以为这只是首都的现象，可是到乡下后，发现集体农庄的庄员生活也很好，家家住的是洋房，屋里陈设着地毯、钢丝床、无线电等等，有的还有钢琴；家家吃的是糖、牛奶、果子面包，高粱、谷子、糙米是他们用来喂牲口的东西；穿的更是讲究，经济情况特别好的庄员出门还有自备汽车；书报是家家都订的。一天劳动完毕后，读书、唱歌、跳舞，生活真是十分欢乐。
    没有到苏联去参观以前，我对社会主义社会有许多糊涂思想。坏人造谣说苏联一切都是公有，吃大锅饭，连小孩也不认得自己的爹妈，我听了半信半疑。如今这种错误思想已一扫而光。我亲眼看到苏联是各尽所能、按劳取酬、多劳多得的社会。庄员们不仅能有丰富的消费资料，而且还能有菜园、果树、家禽。苏联人民的家庭生活是最美满不过的。
    这一切都是共产党领导得来的。现在我已回到祖国，决心把我所参加的农业生产合作社搞好，推动全村走向互助合作的道路，在中国共产党、毛主席的领导下向前迈进。
