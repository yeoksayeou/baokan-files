Workers Building the Capital People's Heroes Monument
Pledge to Make a Hundredfold Effort to Complete the Monument's Construction Project

Respected Chairman Mao: We are all the workers participating in the construction of the Capital People's Heroes Monument. We are writing this letter with the utmost excitement to report to you our determination to complete the glorious and great task you have entrusted to us with a hundredfold effort.

Since you and all the representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference laid the foundation stone for the monument in Tiananmen Square on September 30, 1949, for the past three years, our architectural design workers have successively designed more than one hundred patterns, made dozens of models, adopted the opinions of people from all walks of life, and after continuous summarization and modification, finally created a design pattern that is sufficient to symbolize the solemn image of the people's heroes who sacrificed their lives for the country. Structural engineering personnel have repeatedly and carefully calculated the construction of this 10,000-ton, 37-meter-high building, ensuring that it will be solid and immortal in both material and spirit. Researchers of Chinese revolutionary history have carefully and truthfully studied the battle history of the people's heroes in every stage of the past century, and drafted the themes for the ten large reliefs on the monument. Art workers use the creative spirit of collectivism to carve immortal heroic images. Material procurement personnel have timely procured tens of tons of large granite blocks from thousands of miles away, ensuring the supply of stone materials for the project. Construction personnel have promoted enthusiasm and creativity, ensuring that the project quality reaches the highest standards. Financial personnel ensure that the people's property is not wasted in the project. News photography and communication personnel will report the progress of this project to the people of the whole country and the whole world at any time.

Although we come from all parts of the motherland and master various different technologies, we have a common will and confidence – to victoriously undertake this glorious task. We are well aware of the complexity and arduousness of this task, but we believe that with the leadership of the Communist Party and you, and the support of the people of the whole country, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. After the news of the commencement of the monument project spread, many working people across the country wrote letters requesting to participate in this work. The letter from stone-carving worker Huang Huaijue precisely expresses the thoughts of those who are willing to participate and have already participated in this great project. He said in his letter: "Chairman Mao and the People's Government have brought happiness, joy, and a stable life. This has been exchanged for by the lives and blood of thousands of people's heroes who sacrificed their lives for the country. I volunteer to participate in this work and guarantee to contribute all my skills to this great task to commemorate the immortal heroes."

We, all the staff, assure you that we will definitely complete the entire project victoriously before National Day in 1955, so that the image of the people's heroes will last forever and be passed down through the ages.

The entire staff of the Capital People's Heroes Monument Construction Committee

    保证百倍努力做好纪念碑的修建工程
    敬爱的毛主席：我们是参加兴建首都人民英雄纪念碑的全体工作人员。我们以最兴奋的心情写这封信，向您报告我们要以百倍努力来完成您交给我们的光荣伟大的任务的决心。
    从一九四九年九月三十日您和中国人民政协全体代表在天安门广场为纪念碑奠基以后，三年以来，我们建筑设计工作者陆续设计了一百多种图案，做了几十座模型，采纳了各界人民的意见，经过不断归纳修正后，终于创造出了一座足以象征为国牺牲的人民英雄的庄严形象的设计图案。结构工程人员反复地、慎重地计算了这座重一万吨、高三十七公尺的建筑，保证它结结实实地在物质和精神上都永垂不朽。中国革命历史的研究人员，审慎地、真实地研究了近百年来人民英雄在每一个阶段的战斗史迹，为纪念碑的十面大浮雕上拟出题材。美术工作者，以集体主义的创作精神来刻划不朽的英雄形象。材料的采办人员及时地从千里以外采购了数十吨重的大块花岗石，保证了工程石料的供应。施工人员发扬了积极性和创造性，保证工程质量达到最高标准。财务人员保证在工程中不浪费人民的财产。新闻摄影、通讯人员随时要把这工程的进度报道给全国、全世界的人民知道。
    我们虽然来自祖国的各个地方，掌握着各种不同的技术，但我们却有着共同的意志和信心——胜利地担负起这个光荣的任务。我们深知这任务的复杂与艰巨，但我们相信：有着共产党和您的领导，以及全国人民的支持，是永远没有克服不了的困难的。当纪念碑工程开工的消息传出后，全国很多劳动人民写信要求参加这一工作。刻碑工人黄怀觉的来信正表现了愿意参加以及已经参加这个伟大工程的人员们的思想。他来信中说：“毛主席和人民政府带来了幸福、愉快、安定的生活。这是千千万万为国牺牲的人民英雄们的生命和鲜血换来的。我志愿参加这工作，保证将我所有的技艺全部贡献给这一个伟大的任务，来纪念永垂不朽的英雄们。”
    我们全体工作人员向您保证：我们一定要在一九五五年国庆节前把全部工程胜利完成，让人民英雄们的形象长存千古，万世流芳。
    首都人民英雄纪念碑兴建委员会全体工作人员
