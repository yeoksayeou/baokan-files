The US side, in order to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder for its war of aggression, and to prolong and expand the war, has consistently insisted on the absurd principle of "voluntary repatriation" on the issue of prisoners of war, and has created endless provocative incidents of abusing, slaughtering, and unilaterally handling prisoners of war. From June 7th to October 8th, the US side used continuous requests for three-day, seven-day, and ten-day recesses, causing the conference to be suspended for a total of more than seventy days, attempting to delay and even sabotage the armistice negotiations. It was only due to the patience and sincerity of the Korean and Chinese sides in seeking peace that the negotiations were able to continue.

On September 28th, after several recesses, the US chief negotiator Harrison presented the Korean and Chinese sides with so-called three proposals, requesting the Korean and Chinese sides to resolve the issue of prisoner repatriation according to any one of these three proposals. The first of these proposals argued that after the armistice agreement came into effect, all prisoners of war detained by both sides should be transported to the demilitarized zone. Any prisoner of war who expressed unwillingness to be repatriated and wished to return to the side that detained him should be immediately allowed to return to that side. The second proposal argued that as soon as the armistice agreement came into effect, all prisoners of war who wished to be repatriated should be exchanged quickly. All prisoners of war who opposed repatriation should be divided into groups and sent to the demilitarized zone to be questioned by neutral countries agreed upon by both sides. They could freely go to the side of their choice as indicated by the results of the questioning. The third proposal argued that as soon as the armistice agreement came into effect, all prisoners of war who wished to be repatriated should be exchanged quickly. When transportation capacity permitted, or when it became possible in the future, prisoners of war who had previously expressed opposition to repatriation should be divided into groups and released in the demilitarized zone without being repatriated.

The deceptive nature of this so-called proposal by the US side is very obvious. In this proposal, prisoners of war are still illegally divided into two categories: those willing to be repatriated and those "refusing repatriation," and the so-called "refusal to repatriate" was fabricated by the US side in order to forcibly detain prisoners of war. In April and May of this year, the US side loudly proclaimed that the captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese sides detained on the Korean mainland were all "refusing repatriation," and only those detained on Geoje Island were prisoners of war willing to be repatriated. However, immediately following this, in May and June, British and American journalists could not but report the facts that in Busan and Masan, as well as in many other prisoner-of-war camps on the Korean mainland, our captured personnel were being massively massacred for resolutely demanding repatriation. Most recently, on October 1st, one hundred and sixty-five Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in the US 3A prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island were killed by the US side for celebrating the National Day of the motherland, while the US side had claimed that all those in this prisoner-of-war camp were so-called "refusing repatriation" and "cooperating against communism" prisoners of war. This completely exposed the US side's lie about prisoners of war "refusing repatriation." Therefore, the US side's new "proposal" is just a new conspiracy to achieve its shameless goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war through minor changes in form. US Secretary of State Acheson himself admitted on the 8th of this month that these three proposals were just old tricks of maintaining the so-called "no forced repatriation" principle with a change of soup but not the medicine. And this so-called principle of the US side obviously has nothing in common with the sacred principle of repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice stipulated in the 1949 Geneva Convention, which the Korean and Chinese sides abide by. Therefore, the three proposals of the US side are completely unacceptable.

The US side put forward this deceptive "proposal" with the aim of continuing to delay the armistice negotiations, deceiving the people of the world, and attempting to escape responsibility for delaying the negotiations. An Associated Press dispatch from Munsan on September 29th exposed this conspiracy of the US side; this message said: "The Allied side's efforts are obviously to clearly brand the Communist side with the responsibility for the stalemate." This fully shows that the US side basically did not have the slightest sincerity in solving the problem when it put forward these three "proposals," and its purpose was to sabotage the negotiations, not to promote them.

However, in order to end the Korean War and satisfy the world's people's desire for a Korean armistice, the Korean and Chinese sides put forward a new, completely fair and reasonable proposal at the armistice negotiations conference on October 8th, based on the principle that both sides should release and repatriate all prisoners of war after the armistice. This proposal adopted the formal changes in the US proposal, that is, all prisoners of war should first be sent to the demilitarized zone and handed over to the other party for takeover to complete the preliminary release procedure, without immediate repatriation. The Korean and Chinese sides also proposed that after the prisoners of war have been handed over to the side to which they belong, joint teams from the Red Cross Societies of both sides can visit them to publicize and explain the agreed-upon principle of guaranteeing that prisoners of war can return home to live peaceful lives and no longer participate in the Korean War. In order to further allay the concerns of the US side, the Korean and Chinese sides made more reasonable efforts and stipulated in the proposal that when the parties taking over the prisoners of war conduct visits to the prisoners of war and classify and repatriate them according to the principles of nationality and region, neutral country inspection teams must be present to observe. Anyone can see that this proposal of the Korean and Chinese sides is another major effort to strive for an armistice and strive for peace. If the two sides negotiate on the method on the basis of this proposal, the Korean armistice can be achieved quickly.

However, the US side showed an intolerable and rude attitude towards the reasonable proposal of the Korean and Chinese sides. The US chief negotiator Harrison, after the Korean and Chinese sides put forward the new plan, completely ignored this new suggestion and took out a prepared speech to announce an indefinite recess in the form of an ultimatum until the Korean and Chinese sides were willing to accept the unreasonable plan of the US side. Harrison also rudely left the meeting place without waiting for the representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides to speak. Immediately following Harrison's destructive action in Panmunjom, Acheson and General Clark, commander-in-chief of the US forces invading Korea, also issued statements prepared long ago on the same day, announcing the indefinite suspension of the armistice negotiations and attempting to shift the responsibility for sabotaging the negotiations to the Korean and Chinese sides. They accused the Korean and Chinese sides of not putting forward new suggestions, but they blocked the new proposal of General Nam Il on October 8th in both official statements and news reports, and did not mention it at all. All these facts show that the US side had decided in advance to close the door to negotiations at the October 8th meeting, which was a completely planned and barbaric act to sabotage the armistice negotiations.

According to reports from American news agencies, the reason why the US side took this planned action to sabotage the armistice negotiations was entirely because they premeditated and attempted to force many countries in the United Nations General Assembly to support the US's aggressive propositions of sabotaging negotiations and expanding the war, and to force them to provide more manpower to take chestnuts from the fire for the US on the Korean battlefield. The Wall Street Journal revealed on October 3rd: "The United States will urge the United Nations General Assembly to pass a tough resolution to tell the Communists that they should accept the recently proposed armistice proposal." Otherwise, the US "decision makers and Pentagon personnel are ready for more violent retaliation plans to deal with" the Korean and Chinese countries. After Harrison unreasonably sabotaged the negotiations on October 8th, the United Press International happily claimed: "The suspension of negotiations opens the door to a full discussion of the political issues of the Korean War at the United Nations General Assembly meeting to be held next week." And the purpose of the US in this discussion is what the US news agencies and newspapers have been promoting for a long time, that other countries in the United Nations should "take on more of the burden of the Korean War" for the US's war of aggression in Korea.

Throughout the entire Korean armistice negotiation process, the Korean and Chinese sides have consistently adhered to the internationally recognized Geneva Convention principle of prisoner repatriation, and will continue to wage an unswerving struggle to uphold this principle. In order to achieve the Korean armistice, the Korean and Chinese sides have shown the greatest degree of patience and sincerity. The fair and reasonable proposal put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides on October 8th is the best manifestation of this patience and sincerity. Now that the US side completely refuses to consider the proposal of the Korean and Chinese sides, and completely blocks news of the proposal of the Korean and Chinese sides, and resolutely and unilaterally announces an indefinite recess, then they must bear full responsibility for sabotaging the armistice negotiations.

    关于美方破坏朝鲜停战谈判的经过和他们的责任
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议朝鲜代表团
    美方为了强迫扣留朝中战俘充当侵略战争的炮灰，以便延长和扩大战争，一直在战俘问题上坚持所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬遣俘原则，并制造层出不穷的虐待屠杀战俘和片面处理战俘的挑衅事件。自六月七日起至十月八日止，美方用连续要求三天、七天、十天休会的方式使会议前后总共停顿了七十多天，企图借此拖延以至破坏停战谈判。只是由于朝中方面的忍耐与谋求和平的诚意，才使谈判得以继续下去。
    九月二十八日，美方谈判首席代表哈利逊在经过多次休会以后，向朝中方面提出了所谓三项建议，要求朝中方面按照这三项建议中的任何一项解决遣俘问题。这三项建议的第一项主张：在停战协定生效以后，将双方拘留的全部战俘运往非军事区，任何战俘如表示不愿遣返，希望回到拘留他的一方时，应立即允许他回到该方。第二项建议主张：一俟停战协议生效，所有希望遣返的战俘应迅速予以交换。所有反对遣返的战俘应分成小组送往非军事区，由双方同意的中立国询问他们，他们可以自由前往询问结果所示的他们所选择的一方。第三项建议主张：一俟停战协定生效后，所有希望遣返的战俘应迅速予以交换。在运输能力许可，或者以后有可能时，先前表示反对遣返的战俘应分成小组送往非军事区加以释放，不予遣返。
    美方这个所谓建议的欺骗性质是非常明显的。在这个建议中，战俘仍然被非法地分为愿意遣返的和“拒绝遣返”的两类，而所谓“拒绝遣返”是美方为了强迫扣留战俘制造出来的。在本年四五月中，美方曾大声宣传说在朝鲜大陆上扣留的朝中方面被俘人员都是“拒绝遣返”的，只有巨济岛上被拘留的才是愿意遣返的战俘。可是，紧跟着在五六月中，美英新闻记者就不能不报道在釜山和马山以及朝鲜大陆其他许多战俘营中，我方被俘人员因坚决要求遣返而被大规模屠杀的事实。最近一次，在十月一日，济州岛美方三A战俘营中有一百六十五名中国人民志愿军被俘人员因为庆祝祖国国庆而被美方杀害，而美方却曾经声称在这个战俘营中的都是所谓“拒绝遣返”的“合作反共”的战俘。这就完全揭穿了美方的所谓战俘“拒绝遣返”的鬼话。因此，美方的新“建议”，只是用形式上的微小变动来实现其强迫扣留战俘的无耻目的的新阴谋罢了。美国国务卿艾奇逊自己也在本月八日承认，这三项建议是换汤不换药地保持了所谓“不强迫遣返”原则的老一套办法。而美方的这个所谓原则，显然是和朝中方面信守的一九四九年日内瓦公约所规定的停战以后遣返全部战俘的神圣原则毫无共同之处的。因此，美方的三个建议是完全不能接受的。
    美方提出这个欺骗性的“建议”，目的是在继续拖延停战谈判，欺骗世界人民，并企图逃脱拖延谈判的责任。美联社九月二十九日从汶山发出的消息暴露了美方的这种阴谋；这个消息说：“联军方面的努力显然是要给共方清楚地打上负僵局之责的烙印。”这就完全说明美方在提出这三项“建议”时，就基本没有丝毫解决问题的诚意，其目的是为了破坏谈判，而不是为了促进谈判。
    但是，朝中方面为了结束朝鲜战争，以满足世界人民对于朝鲜停战的渴望，在十月八日的停战谈判大会上，根据停战以后双方应释放和遣返全部战俘的原则，提出了新的完全公平合理的提案。这个提案采纳了美方建议中形式上的变动，即将全部战俘首先送至非军事区交由对方接管，以完成初步的释放手续，而不实行立即遣返。朝中方面并提出在战俘已经交给所属一方接管以后，可由双方红十字会联合小组对他们进行访问，向他们宣扬和解释已经协议的保证战俘回家过和平生活，不再参加朝鲜战争的原则。朝中方面为了进一步解除美方的顾虑，更作了合理的努力，在提案中规定在接管战俘的双方对战俘进行访问和按照国籍、地区分类原则来进行分类和遣返时，须由中立国视察小组在场观察。朝中方面这个提案，谁都可以看出是为了争取停战，争取和平的又一次重大努力。如果双方在这个提案的基础上，就方法上进行协商，朝鲜停战是可以迅速实现的。
    但是美方对朝中方面的合理提案竟表现了不可容忍的粗暴态度。美方谈判首席代表哈利逊在朝中方面提出新方案以后，根本不注意这一新建议，就拿出早就准备好的发言稿，以提出最后通牒的方式宣布无限期休会到朝中方面愿意接受美方的无理方案的时候为止。哈利逊并且不等朝中方面代表发言，就无礼地迳自离开会场。紧接着哈利逊在板门店采取这一破坏行动之后，艾奇逊和侵朝美军总司令克拉克也在同一天发表了早就准备好的声明，宣布无限期中止停战谈判，并企图将破坏谈判的责任推给朝中方面。他们指责朝中方面没有提出新的建议，可是他们无论在官方声明方面，或是在新闻报道方面都对南日将军十月八日的新提案加以封锁，绝口不谈。所有这些事实，说明美方事先就已经决定要在十月八日的会议上关闭谈判之门，这完全是有计划地破坏停战谈判的横蛮行为。
    根据美国通讯社的报道，美方之所以采取这一有计划地破坏停战谈判的行动，完全是因为他们预谋并企图压迫联合国大会许多国家来支持美国的破坏谈判、扩大战争的侵略主张，要强迫他们拿出更多的人力来在朝鲜战场上替美国火中取栗。十月三日华尔街日报就透露：“美国将促使联合国大会通过强硬的决议来告诉共方说，他们应该接受最近提出的停战建议。”否则，美国的“决策者和五角大楼人士已经准备更猛烈的报复计划来对付”朝中两国。十月八日在哈利逊无理破坏谈判之后，合众社就喜形于色地声称：“停止谈判给在下周召开的联合国大会会议上全面讨论朝鲜战争的政治问题打开了大门。”而在这个讨论中的美方目的，就是美方通讯社和报纸宣扬了很久的要联合国其他国家对美国在朝鲜的侵略战争“更多地承担朝鲜战争的负担”。
    朝中方面在整个朝鲜停战谈判过程中，一贯坚持着国际公认的日内瓦公约遣俘原则，并将继续为坚持这一原则而进行始终不渝的斗争。为了实现朝鲜停战，朝中方面已经表示了最大限度的忍耐和诚意。朝中方面在十月八日提出的公平合理的提案，就是这种忍耐与诚意的最好表现。美方现在既然完全拒绝考虑朝中方面提案，并且对朝中方面提案完全封锁消息，而断然片面宣布无限期休会，那末，他们就必须担负破坏停战谈判的全部责任。                 （新华社）
