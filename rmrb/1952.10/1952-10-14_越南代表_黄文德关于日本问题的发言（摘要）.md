    Vietnamese Representative
    Hoang Van Duc's Speech on the Japanese Question (Summary)
    In the face of the fact that American imperialism is remilitarizing Japan, we, the Vietnamese people, are as worried as the people of Asia and the Pacific region and the whole world.

    During World War II, the Japanese fascist bandits created countless disasters in various countries in Asia and the Pacific region, and the Vietnamese people were direct victims of these disasters.

    In September 1940, Japanese troops invaded Vietnamese territory, and the French colonialists immediately surrendered, offering Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to the Japanese fascists. The Japanese fascists then used the French colonialists as their pawns to carry out cruel oppression and exploitation of the Vietnamese people. The dual exploitation by the Japanese fascists and the French colonialists caused serious disasters in the northern plains of Vietnam and the northern part of central Vietnam. In just a few months at the end of 1944 and the beginning of 1945, two million people starved to death in this region with a population of only ten million. How can the Vietnamese people forget these heinous crimes committed by the Japanese fascist bandits in Vietnam?

    Japanese imperialists are the common enemy of the people of Asia and the Pacific region. However, today, in order to realize its aggressive aims, American imperialism is once again supporting the forces of Japanese militarism, which poses a serious threat to the independence of Southeast Asian countries and nations, to the countries of Asia and the Pacific region, and to world peace. According to a report by Agence France-Presse earlier this year, American imperialists are preparing to send Japanese troops to fight in Vietnam, which has aroused great anger and resolute opposition from the Vietnamese people.

    The Vietnamese people resolutely oppose the San Francisco unilateral peace treaty with Japan.

    For the Vietnamese people, this treaty is worthless, not only because it was not signed by the Soviet Union and many Asian countries, including the two major powers of the People's Republic of China and India, with a population of 800 million; but also because some shameless people such as the puppet Bảo Đại have signed it. These shameless people not only did not resist the Japanese fascists in the past, but on the contrary, were accomplices of the Japanese fascists. They cannot represent anyone and have no legal rights.

    The Vietnamese people demand the abolition of the San Francisco unilateral peace treaty with Japan and demand the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.

    Our Vietnamese delegation fully agrees with Mr. Guo Moruo's opinion in the general report on opposing the remilitarization of Japan and demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. We believe that only when these demands are realized will Japanese militarists and Japan's war power not become tools for American imperialism to invade and provoke war.

    We extend our deep sympathy to the Japanese people who are suffering greatly under the enslavement of the American aggressors and the Yoshida reactionaries; similarly, we firmly support the Japanese people's struggle for peace, independence, democracy, and happiness.

    This conference has fully demonstrated the spirit of solidarity and friendship of our people towards the Japanese people, and has also fully demonstrated our firm will to fight against the various provocations and aggressive conspiracies carried out by American imperialism in Japan.

    Just as they have long distinguished between French and American imperialists and the people of France and the United States, the Vietnamese people have never confused the Japanese people with Japanese fascists. In the past, the Vietnamese people already knew that it was not the Japanese officers who created disasters on Vietnamese territory who represented the Japanese people, but the Japanese women and kind Japanese men who lay on the tracks to prevent trains from transporting Japanese troops to carry out aggression. Today, the Vietnamese people are even more aware that it is not those who are willing to be lackeys and mercenaries for American war merchants who represent the Japanese people, but all the Japanese people who are fighting for their right to survival, for independence, peace, and democracy.

    The Vietnamese people deeply sympathize with the Japanese people who are struggling today and resolutely oppose the American imperialists' re-establishment of Japanese militarist forces, just as they are determined not to allow American imperialism to use Vietnam as their base for launching a third world war. The path of the Vietnamese people's struggle has always been the same, which is the path of defending national independence and defending world peace! (Xinhua News Agency)

    黄文德关于日本问题的发言（摘要）
    在美帝国主义使日本重新军国主义化的事实面前，我们越南人民正和亚洲及太平洋区域和全世界人民一样感到忧虑。
    在第二次世界大战中，日本法西斯匪徒，不知曾经在亚洲及太平洋区域各国制造了多少灾难，而越南人民正是这种灾难的直接受害者。
    一九四○年九月，日本军队侵入了越南国土，法国殖民者立刻就屈膝投降，把越南、高棉和寮国献给了日本法西斯。日本法西斯便利用法国殖民者作他的爪牙，对越南人民进行残酷的压迫和剥削。日本法西斯和法国殖民者的双重剥削，在越南北部平原和越南中部的北面地区造成了严重的灾害，仅在一九四四年底和一九四五年初的几个月里，在这一个只有一千万人口的地区内，就有二百万人饿死了。日本法西斯匪徒在越南所造成的这种滔天罪行，越南人民难道可能忘记吗？
    日本帝国主义者是亚洲及太平洋区域人民的公敌。然而今天美帝国主义为了实现其侵略的目的，又重新把日本军国主义势力扶植起来，这对于东南亚各国和各民族的独立，对于亚洲及太平洋区域各国以及全世界的和平，都是一个严重的威胁。根据今年年初法新社的报道，美帝国主义者正在准备派遣日本军队前往越南作战，这件事已经引起了越南人民极大的愤怒和坚决的反对。
    越南人民坚决反对旧金山片面对日和约。
    对于越南人民，这张和约是毫无价值的，这不仅因为它没有苏联和亚洲许多国家签字，其中包括拥有八亿人口的中华人民共和国和印度两个大国；而且还因为这里面有着一些无耻之流如傀儡保大等在上面签了字，这些无耻之流过去不仅没有反抗日本法西斯，相反地是做了日本法西斯的帮手，他们不能代表任何人，也没有任何合法的权利。
    越南人民要求废除旧金山片面对日和约，要求缔结一个全面性质的对日和约。
    我们越南代表团完全同意郭沫若先生在总报告中关于反对日本重新军国主义化和要求缔结对日全面和约的意见。我们认为，只有这些要求获得实现，日本军国主义者和日本的战争力量才不会成为美帝国主义用以侵略和挑动战争的工具。
    我们对于在美国侵略者和吉田反动派奴役下感到莫大痛苦的日本人民，寄以深切的同情；同样地，我们对于日本人民为了和平、独立、民主、幸福而进行的斗争，坚决加以支持。
    这次会议已经充分地显示出我们各国人民对于日本人民的团结友爱精神，同时也已经充分地显示出我们为了反对美帝国主义在日本所进行的种种挑拨和侵略的阴谋而斗争的坚强意志。
    正如早就把法、美帝国主义者与法国和美国的人民划分清楚一样，越南人民从来就没有把日本人民和日本法西斯混为一谈。过去越南人民就已经知道代表日本人民的并不是那批在越南国土上制造灾害的日本军官，而是卧在铁轨上阻止列车运送日本军队去进行侵略的日本妇女和日本善良的男人。今天越南人民更认识到代表日本人民的不是那批甘心为美国战争贩子充当走狗和雇佣兵的人们，而是一切正在为争取生存权利争取独立、和平、民主而斗争的日本人民。
    越南人民极同情今天正在斗争中的日本人民，坚决反对美帝国主义者重新恢复日本军国主义势力，正如决心不让美帝国主义利用越南作为他们发动第三次世界大战的基地一样。越南人民斗争的道路始终如一，这就是保卫民族独立与保卫世界和平的道路！（新华社）
