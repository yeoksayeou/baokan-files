Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 18th: Eight days after the US side abruptly closed the door to the armistice negotiations on October 8th, US representative Harrison finally sent a letter to General Nam Il on October 16th, acknowledging that the Chinese and Korean side had made a proposal on October 8th, and declaring its rejection. In the letter, Harrison also put forward a ridiculously arrogant condition for resuming negotiations: either the Chinese and Korean side accept their proposal to retain prisoners of war, or propose a suggestion that the US side approves of, otherwise they will not come to the meeting. Harrison's letter all the more clearly shows the US attempt to force the United Nations General Assembly to endorse the US's claim to forcibly detain prisoners of war under the guise of "non-forcible repatriation," thereby suspending negotiations and making it impossible to resume them. The purpose of his letter is obviously to use the mild wording of "merely announcing a recess" to carry out deceptive propaganda in order to ease public dissatisfaction with his suspension of the Panmunjom negotiations. But this aim of his will never be achieved.

Harrison's letter further proves that the US representatives were eager to carry out Washington's order to suspend negotiations before the United Nations General Assembly convened. Therefore, they did not mention General Nam Il's new proposal until a week after the October 8th meeting. After the suspension of the negotiations, Harrison, Clark, and Acheson did not say a word about General Nam Il's proposal. Even the so-called allies whom the US representative nominally represents were completely unaware of this proposal.

Observers in Panmunjom pointed out that after General Nam Il made his new proposal, Harrison immediately rattled off four sentences, stubbornly insisting on the US side's claim to retain prisoners of war, and then read a lengthy statement prepared in advance to suspend the negotiations, occupying more than half of the meeting time. Harrison was not there to consider or discuss any proposals at all, but was determined to suspend the negotiations.

Evidence that the US side intends to make it impossible to resume the Panmunjom negotiations has been found again in Harrison's letter. The letter reiterates that negotiations cannot be resumed unless the Chinese and Korean side accept the US demand to retain prisoners of war or submit a "written" proposal that the US side considers to be a "constructive suggestion." Harrison insists that any proposal to repatriate all prisoners of war is "not a constructive suggestion." Therefore, the only constructive suggestion is to accept the US side's final ultimatum to retain prisoners of war, which Harrison presented when he suspended the negotiations.

It is very clear that Harrison has closed all doors to the resumption of negotiations. He knows that the US demand to retain prisoners of war will never be accepted, and he has made it impossible for either side to convene a meeting according to the custom of the past fifteen months of negotiations.

Like Harrison, Clark has so far suppressed the news about the three proposals made by Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai in their letter to him. In order to cover up the US responsibility for sabotaging the negotiations, the United Nations Command did not publish any content of the letter from Kim and Peng in the brief communique issued in Tokyo after its liaison officer received the letter in Panmunjom.

It is believed here that the US side can never escape the responsibility for sabotaging the armistice negotiations, for two reasons: they broke off the negotiations and closed the door to resuming them. Their guilt as saboteurs of the armistice negotiations cannot be lessened by writing letters or arbitrarily engaging in deceptive propaganda. They must show by their actions that they are willing to continue negotiations. Whether to open this door and return to the negotiating table, or to bear all the responsibility for destroying the hope of a Korean armistice, now depends entirely on the US side.

    哈利逊空口抵赖破坏朝鲜停战谈判的责任
    开城观察家揭破美方欺骗宣传并要他们用行动来表明态度
    【新华社开城十八日电】在十月八日美方断然关闭了停战谈判之门以后的第八天，十月十六日，美方代表哈利逊才给南日将军来了一封信，承认我方在十月八日提出了建议，并声明加以拒绝。哈利逊在信中并提出哀的美敦式的恢复谈判条件：要我方或者接受他们的扣留战俘的建议，或者提出美方认可的建议，否则他们就不来开会。哈利逊这封信，更加明显地显示出美方企图强迫联合国大会赞同美国以“不强迫遣返”为招牌强迫扣留战俘的主张，从而中止谈判并使其无法恢复。他这封信的目的，显然是想用“只不过宣布休会”这种轻淡字眼来进行欺骗宣传，以缓和公众对他中止板门店谈判所表示的不满。但是他这种目的是永远达不到的。
    哈利逊的这封信进一步证明：美方代表们急于在联合国大会开会之前执行华盛顿要他们中止谈判的命令，因此，他们一直到十月八日会议之后隔了一个星期才来提到南日将军的新建议。在中止谈判之后，哈利逊、克拉克及艾奇逊对南日将军的建议一直只字不提。甚至美国代表在名义上代表着的所谓盟国，也根本不知道这个建议。
    板门店观察家们指出：在南日将军提出他的新建议之后，哈利逊马上顺口说出四句话，顽固地坚持美方扣留战俘的主张，接着宣读了一篇事前预备好的中止谈判的长篇声明，占了会议一半以上的时间。哈利逊根本不是来考虑或讨论任何建议的，而是决心要中止谈判。
    美方打算使板门店谈判无法恢复的证据，在哈利逊的信中又再度找到了。这封信重申：在朝中方面接受美方扣留战俘的要求或以“书面”提出美方认为是“建设性建议”之前，谈判是不能恢复的。哈利逊坚持说，任何主张遣返全部战俘的建议“都不是建设性的建议”。因此，唯一建设性的建议就是接受哈利逊在使谈判中止时提出的美方扣留战俘的最后通牒。
    非常清楚，哈利逊关闭了一切恢复谈判的大门，他知道美方扣留战俘的要求是永不会被接受的，他已经使得按照过去十五个月谈判的习惯由任何一方召开会议成为不可能了。
    和哈利逊一样，克拉克迄今一直扣压着关于金日成和彭德怀两将军在给他的信中提出三项建议的消息。为了掩饰美方破坏谈判的责任，联合国军司令部在它的联络官在板门店接到这封信后在东京发表的简短公报中，并未发表金、彭两将军的去信的任何内容。
    此间认为，美方决逃避不了破坏停战谈判的责任，理由有二：他们使谈判破裂，并关闭了恢复谈判的大门。他们作为停战谈判破坏者的罪过，并不能因他们写信或恣意进行欺骗宣传而减轻。他们必须用行动来表明他们是愿意继续谈判的。是打开这个门回来谈判呢，还是承担起消灭朝鲜停战希望的全部责任呢，现在完全要看美方了。
