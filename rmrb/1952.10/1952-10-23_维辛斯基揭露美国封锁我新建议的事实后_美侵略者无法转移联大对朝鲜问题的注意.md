Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: According to TASS Moscow, 21st dispatch: "Pravda" correspondents in New York, Kraminov and Litoshko, commented on the reaction of American newspapers to the initial days of the United Nations General Assembly: The speech delivered by Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, at the plenary session of the General Assembly on October 18th, attracted the attention of the entire assembly. Therefore, even the most reactionary American newspapers could not ignore it. They had to publish summaries of the speech and comment on it. The American press pointed out that the speech directly denounced the aggressive policies of the American ruling clique. Bourgeois newspapers published slanderous articles, carrying out provocative attacks on the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. However, the bourgeois newspapers could not hide from their readers some of the most important proposals made in Vyshinsky's speech. In particular, American newspapers could not but widely comment on the conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question proposed in the speech.

The "Pravda" reporter pointed out that the problem lies in the fact that the American ruling clique concealed a fact from public opinion: General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, had already submitted specific proposals to the United States on October 8th for resolving the issue of prisoners of war. However, the U.S. military headquarters did not respond to this proposal and abruptly interrupted the negotiations. The American newspapers, like the representatives of the American ruling clique, had always kept silent about this proposal. It was not until Vyshinsky delivered his speech and made the proposal known to the world that they became busy. It is not surprising that the fact pointed out by Vyshinsky at the United Nations General Assembly was completely unexpected even by the best-informed American journalists. Now, American newspapers are fabricating various absurd excuses in an attempt to extricate themselves from their predicament. The embarrassing situation of the American ruling clique can be proven by the reports on the activities of the American delegation. According to the newspapers, after Vyshinsky's speech, the American delegation hurriedly submitted a report to the United Nations on the progress of the Panmunjom negotiations. In this report, the American delegation attempted to prove that "the Communist side had not put forward any concrete proposals" in the past six months.

The "Pravda" reporter continued: Although the American delegation spared no effort, after Vyshinsky's speech, the peaceful resolution of the Korean question immediately attracted the attention of the American public. The American delegation was unable to divert the General Assembly's attention from this major international issue.

According to the "New York World-Telegram and Sun," Secretary of State Acheson's speech was such a failure that it gave the Soviet delegation another opportunity to expose American foreign policy. The newspaper said that American diplomacy will be in a difficult situation at this session.

    维辛斯基揭露美国封锁我新建议的事实后
    美侵略者无法转移联大对朝鲜问题的注意
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十一日电：“真理报”驻纽约记者克拉明诺夫和李托希科评论美国报纸关于联合国大会最初几天情况的反应说：苏联代表团团长维辛斯基十月十八日在联大全体会议上发表的演说，吸引了整个大会的注意。因此，甚至美国最反动的报纸也无法不予理会。它们不得不发表这篇演说的摘要，并加以评论。美国报界指出：这篇演说直接斥责了美国统治集团的侵略政策。资产阶级报纸纷纷刊载诽谤性的文章，对以苏联为首的和平民主阵营进行挑衅攻击。然而，资产阶级报纸却无法向他们的读者隐瞒维辛斯基演说中所提出的一些最重要的建议。特别是，美国报纸不能不对演说中所提出的关于和平解决朝鲜问题的条件广泛加以评论。
    “真理报”记者指出：问题在于美国统治集团对舆论界隐瞒了一个事实：朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军已在十月八日向美国提出了解决战俘问题的具体建议，然而美军司令部没有答复这个建议，就断然中断了谈判。美国报纸也像美国统治集团的代表一样，向来绝口不提这个建议，一直到维辛斯基发表演说使全世界都知道这个建议之后，他们才忙了起来。维辛斯基在联合国大会上指出的这个事实，甚至美国消息最灵通的记者也完全没有料想到，这是不足为奇的。现在美国报纸正制造各种荒谬的遁辞企图来使它们脱出窘境。美国统治集团狼狈失措的情况，从报纸所报道的关于美国代表团的活动中可以得到证明。据报纸说：美国代表团在维辛斯基演说以后，慌忙送交联合国一份关于板门店谈判经过的报告书。美国代表团在这个报告书里企图证明在过去六个月里“共方没有提出过任何具体建议”。
    “真理报”记者继续写道：美国代表团虽然费尽心机，但是在维辛斯基演说以后，和平解决朝鲜问题立刻引起了美国公众的注意。美国代表团并没有能够转移大会对于这个重大国际问题的注意。
    据“纽约世界电讯太阳报”说：美国国务卿艾奇逊的演说如此失败，它又给苏联代表团一个揭露美国外交政策的机会。报纸说：美国外交在本届会议上将处于困难的境地。
