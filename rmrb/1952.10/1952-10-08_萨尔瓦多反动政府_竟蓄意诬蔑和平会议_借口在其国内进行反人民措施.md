Xinhua News Agency, October 5th: According to reports from American news agencies, the government of El Salvador, using the excuse of a "Communist conspiracy to overthrow the government," declared a 30-day state of martial law on September 26th and carried out mass arrests throughout the country. The National Assembly of El Salvador also issued an order suspending constitutional rights, abolishing the people's freedoms of assembly, association, and speech, and restricting personal freedom of travel. According to a United Press International report, more than 1,200 people were arrested throughout El Salvador on September 26th alone.

A United Press International dispatch from San Salvador, dated September 27th, stated that Salvadoran President Osorio said in a nationwide broadcast after the mass arrests began:

"The independence of El Salvador has been threatened because the Communists at the Beijing conference have specifically singled out El Salvador as the cornerstone for the sovietization of Central American countries." Osorio's extremely absurd and ridiculous fabrication is clearly intended to deliberately slander the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference being held in Beijing and to create an excuse for his anti-people measures.

    萨尔瓦多反动政府
    竟蓄意诬蔑和平会议
    借口在其国内进行反人民措施
   【新华社五日讯】据美国通讯社报道，萨尔瓦多政府以“共产党阴谋推翻政府”为借口，在九月二十六日宣布全国戒严三十天，并在全国各地大肆逮捕。萨尔瓦多国民议会并颁布了停止宪法权利的命令，取消人民的集会、结社的自由和言论自由，限制私人的旅行自由。合众社消息说，在九月二十六日一天之内，萨尔瓦多全国各地被逮捕的已有一千二百多人。
    据合众社圣萨尔瓦多九月二十七日电称，萨尔瓦多总统欧索里奥在大逮捕开始以后向全国广播说：
    “萨尔瓦多的独立已经受到了威胁，因为共产党在北京会议中已经将萨尔瓦多特别提出，作为中美洲国家苏维埃化的基石。”欧索里奥这种极端荒谬可笑的捏造，目的显然是蓄意污蔑正在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，并为自己的反人民措施制造借口。
