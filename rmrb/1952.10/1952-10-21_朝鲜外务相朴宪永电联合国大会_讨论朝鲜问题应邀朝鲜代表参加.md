To Mr. Pearson, Chairman of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, New York:

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has learned that the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, currently in session, will discuss the Korean issue. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea hereby authorizes me to make the following statement:

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly requested the United Nations General Assembly, through the United Nations Secretariat, to invite representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in discussions regarding the Korean issue.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that when member states of the United Nations discuss the Korean issue, they must hear the opinions of the representatives of the Korean people regarding the truth about the barbaric bombings, the destruction of peaceful cities and villages, and the illegal and heinous acts of germ warfare and chemical warfare committed by the aggressors on the territory of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Now, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea once again makes a request that representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea must be invited to participate in the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

    While making the above request, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also declares that any discussion regarding the Korean issue or any resolution of the United Nations General Assembly without the participation of Korean representatives will be considered illegal.

    Park Heon-yeong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

    朝鲜外务相朴宪永电联合国大会
    讨论朝鲜问题应邀朝鲜代表参加
    【新华社平壤二十日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永在十七日致电联合国第七届大会主席皮尔逊，就朝鲜民主主义人民共和国要求派遣代表参加联合国第七届大会关于朝鲜问题的讨论事发表声明。电文如下：纽约联合国第七届大会主席皮尔逊先生：
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府获悉，现在正举行的联合国第七届大会要讨论朝鲜问题。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为此特授权本人作如下声明：
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾数次通过联合国秘书处要求联合国大会邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加有关朝鲜问题的讨论。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为：联合国会员国在讨论朝鲜问题时，必须听取朝鲜人民代表对于侵略者在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领土上所制造的野蛮轰炸、破坏和平城乡及细菌战、化学战等非法的罪恶暴行真相的意见。现在，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府再一次就朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表必须被邀请参加联合国第七届大会这一件事提出要求。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在提出上述要求的同时，并声明：没有朝鲜代表参加的有关朝鲜问题的任何讨论，或是联合国大会的任何决议，都将被认为是非法的。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永
    一九五二年十月十七日于平壤市
