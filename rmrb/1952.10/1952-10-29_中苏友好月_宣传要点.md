"Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" Propaganda Points
Zhong Su You Hao Xie Hui Zong Hui (All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association)

(I) The Great Achievements of the Soviet Union in the Past Thirty-Five Years

(1) The great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history, initiating a fundamental transformation from the old capitalist world to the new socialist world. Since then, for thirty-five years, the Soviet people have victoriously built a socialist society, creating a new social system without exploitation; in the World Anti-Fascist War, the Soviet people and the Soviet army achieved the victory of the Great Patriotic War, thus liberating mankind from the enslavement of German, Italian, and Japanese fascism, and opening up a broad path for the cause of world people's lasting peace and people's democracy; now the Soviet people are fighting for the Fifth Five-Year Plan, advancing towards an infinitely happy communist society. All these are unparalleled great victories of world historical significance achieved by the Soviet people under the leadership of the great Lenin and Stalin; all these have infinitely encouraged the working people of the world, and strengthened their confidence in striving for their own liberation, for socialism, and for the great future of communism.

(2) In the October Socialist Revolution of 1917, the Russian working class, led by the Russian Communist Party, united with the broad masses of the laboring people, achieved victory over the capitalists and landlords, overthrew the bourgeois regime, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, and consolidated the worker-peasant alliance. The October Revolution abolished the landlord land ownership system, nationalized all land in the country, and transferred the land to the peasants for use; abolished the capitalist exploitation system, and turned factories, railways, and banks into the property of all the people. Thus, the first new-style socialist country appeared in the world for the first time, breaking through the shackles of capitalism on one-sixth of the world's land.

(3) After the October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet people crushed the armed intervention of imperialist countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, and eliminated the domestic counter-revolutionary rebellions. Afterwards, after a period of restoring the national economy, they further struggled to realize the socialist national industrialization, and on the basis of national industrialization, struggled to implement agricultural collectivization. Through several great Stalin's Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union was built into an extremely rich and strong socialist country.

(4) From June 1941, under the leadership of Stalin and the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet people waged the Great Patriotic War to crush the invasion of the German Hitler fascist bandits. After four years of bloody battles, the heroic Soviet army finally completely crushed the Hitler bandit army, and even fought all the way to Berlin, the capital of Germany, forcing fascist Germany to surrender unconditionally. As a result of this war, many European countries enslaved by Hitler fascism were liberated. In August 1945, the powerful Soviet army also eliminated the main force of the Japanese invading army, the Kwantung Army, which occupied Northeast China, and liberated northern Korea, forcing the Japanese invaders to surrender unconditionally.

(5) After the end of the Patriotic War, the Soviet Union immediately carried out peaceful construction. After the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's industrial and agricultural production quickly recovered and exceeded pre-war levels, and a series of great construction projects unparalleled in the world began (such as the Lenin Canal connecting the Volga River and the Don River, the Turkmen Main Canal, the South Ukraine Canal, the North Crimean Canal, the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, the Stalingrad Hydropower Station, etc.). From 1951, the Soviet Union began the Fifth Five-Year Construction Plan, bringing the Soviet national economy to a new and huge upsurge. This is another major step forward for the Soviet Union on the road from socialism to communism.

(6) Although the Soviet Union suffered damage from the Hitler bandit army during the Patriotic War, the industrial production in 1951 increased more than twelve and a half times compared to 1929; while the industrial production of capitalist countries, even with the stimulus of expanding armaments, remained almost stagnant at the original level during the same period. The United States, which was completely unaffected by the war and made a fortune by taking advantage of the war, only increased its industrial production by one time. This proves the great superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, and the demise of the capitalist system is inevitable.

(II) The Soviet Union's Significant Assistance to China's Revolutionary Cause and Construction

(1) The Soviet Union's various assistance to China's revolutionary movement and the construction of the People's Republic of China over the past thirty years fully proves Chairman Mao Zedong's famous assertion: The interests of the Soviet Union are consistent with the interests of mankind; at the same time, it fully proves what Chairman Mao Zedong said in the article "Stalin is a Friend of the Chinese People": "Only socialist countries, socialist leaders, socialist people, socialist thinkers, politicians, and workers can truly assist the cause of liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people; and our cause cannot achieve final victory without their assistance."

(2) After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union immediately announced the abolition of the unequal treaties imposed on China by Tsarist Russia. During the Great Revolution in China from 1924 to 1927, the Soviet government and people gave direct help to the Chinese revolution. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in China in 1937, the Soviet Union not only signed a non-aggression treaty with our country, but also actively provided our country with huge assistance in military materials, and many heroic Soviet aviators directly participated in our country's Anti-Japanese War. In August 1945, the Soviet Union sent troops to annihilate the Japanese Kwantung Army that had invaded and occupied Northeast China, decisively helping the Chinese people achieve the final victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

(3) After the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, the Soviet Union was the first country to immediately announce the establishment of diplomatic relations with our country. Then, with the personal participation of Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong, the two countries signed the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance" on February 14, 1950, making the 700 million people of the two countries form an unbreakable and powerful alliance. At the same time, the two countries signed the "Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou and Dalian" and the "Agreement on Loans to the People's Republic of China," which fully conformed to the interests of our country. In addition, the two countries have successively signed a series of agreements that are beneficial to our country's construction, beneficial to the common interests of the two peoples, and beneficial to safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. The Soviet Union has provided great and selfless assistance to our country's economic and cultural construction in terms of financial resources, material resources, technical transfer, and work guidance.

(4) Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union has consistently given our country significant support in all diplomatic occasions. Together with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, in the United Nations and other occasions, they have carried out resolute struggles to expose the United States' conspiracy to invade our country and the Far East, oppose the United States' aggression against Korea and occupation of our country's Taiwan, and oppose the United States' unreasonable denial of our country's right to attend the United Nations. All these struggles have played a great role in opposing wars of aggression and isolating American warmongers.

(5) In August and September this year, China and the Soviet Union held talks in Moscow again to discuss important political and economic issues related to the relations between the two countries. As a result of the talks, the Sino-Soviet announcement on the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the Government of the People's Republic of China was announced. The two sides agreed to begin various measures so that the Soviet government would unconditionally transfer all rights to jointly manage the Chinese Changchun Railway and all properties belonging to the railway to our country before the end of 1952. In this meeting, in view of the fact that Japan has refused to conclude a comprehensive treaty and has concluded a unilateral treaty with the United States and other countries, and therefore has not concluded a treaty with China and the Soviet Union, thus creating conditions that endanger the cause of peace and facilitate the recurrence of Japanese aggression, our country has proposed extending the term of the joint Sino-Soviet use of the Chinese Lushunkou naval base, because this is conducive to ensuring peace in the Far East and the world and the security of China. The Soviet government accepted and agreed to this proposal of our country, and the two sides exchanged letters. This meeting fully demonstrated that the Soviet Union's commitment to the obligations of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is unwavering, and the Soviet Union is a great defender of peace in the East and the world.

(III) Strengthen the Alliance of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Cooperation between China and the Soviet Union

(1) In order to defend peace in the East and the world, and to ensure China's independence and security, it is necessary to strengthen the alliance of friendship, mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Facts have proved that the powerful alliance of friendship, mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is a strong guarantee to prevent the re-aggression of Japan and any country that colludes with Japan in aggressive acts, and to defend peace in the East and the world. Now American imperialism is continuing to delay and undermine the Korean armistice talks, conspiring to expand the war of aggression against Korea, and is still occupying our country's territory of Taiwan; at the same time, American imperialism is attempting to use the militarist forces of Japan and Germany to launch new wars of aggression. Therefore, strengthening the alliance of friendship, mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is of even greater significance.

(2) In order to consolidate our country's revolutionary victory and rapidly develop our country's construction cause, it is necessary to strengthen the alliance of friendship, mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Facts have proved that without the assistance of the Soviet Union and international revolutionary forces, not only the victory of the Chinese revolution would be impossible, but also the victory of China's construction cause would be impossible. In the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the tremendous assistance that the Soviet government and people have given to our country in various aspects is an important condition for the smooth progress and rapid completion of our country's economic recovery work. Many Soviet experts working in China have played a great role in the rapid recovery and development of our country's economy. The assistance given to our country by the Soviet government and people is sincere and selfless, and is truly based on the principles of brotherly friendship and equality and mutual benefit. Now our country is about to enter into large-scale economic and cultural construction, and needs to further build our national defense. In all these aspects, we will receive greater help from the Soviet Union, so that our construction cause can achieve complete victory.

(IV) Learn from the Soviet Union, Learn Marxism-Leninism

(1) We should learn all advanced experiences of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is the most advanced socialist country and is the teacher of us. We must learn well from the Soviet Union. We should learn from the Soviet Union's experience in carrying out planned economy, learn from the Soviet Union's experience in industrial construction and agricultural construction, learn from the Soviet Union's experience in national defense construction, learn from the Soviet Union's experience in national construction, learn from the Soviet Union's experience in scientific and technological work, and learn from the Soviet Union's experience in literary and artistic work and cultural and educational work. The construction work in China over the past three years has proved that learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is fully in line with the needs of our country's construction. This kind of learning can enable us to avoid many detours and greatly accelerate the speed of our country's construction.

(2) We should learn from the Soviet people's spirit of patriotism and internationalism. The Soviet people carry out selfless labor in order to build their motherland, and everyone strives to make their labor achieve brilliant results and make more and greater contributions to the motherland. During the Patriotic War, they carried out heroic and fearless battles to defend their motherland. These all demonstrated the Soviet people's high spirit of patriotism. The Soviet people have consistently actively cared for and supported the liberation cause of the working people of all countries and all oppressed nations. During the Second World War, the Soviet people paid a huge price for the common cause of the anti-fascism of the people of all countries in the world. The Soviet government and people have consistently actively given generous and selfless assistance to the fraternal countries. After our country's liberation, many Soviet experts came to our country to help our construction, and their loyal and wholehearted service spirit moved everyone of us. These all demonstrated the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet people.

(3) The Soviet Union's revolution and construction were won under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and under the direct leadership of Lenin and Stalin. The Soviet Union's experience in all work, and the Soviet people's spirit of patriotism and internationalism, are all cultivated and developed under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, the Soviet Union's achievements in science and literature and art have reached the highest peak in the world. It must be understood that learning from the various advanced experiences of the Soviet Union is inseparable from learning Marxism-Leninism, and these two things are unified. Chairman Mao Zedong once pointed out that China initially learned Marxism from the Russians, and the Chinese Communist Party was established and developed by modeling itself on the Soviet Communist Party. Comrade Stalin's theory on the Chinese revolution has an immeasurable significance for the victory of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese revolution. We have achieved the victory of the revolution because we have learned Marxism-Leninism. It is very clear that in the future, if we want to achieve the victory of construction, we must further study the revolutionary theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

(4) Comrade Stalin's recently published theoretical work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is a great new contribution to the development of Marxism-Leninism, and it points out to all mankind the concrete path from socialism to communism. Comrade Stalin discovered the basic economic law of modern capitalism and the basic economic law of socialism, and thereby explained the incomparable superiority of socialism over capitalism. The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with Comrade Stalin's theoretical work as its program, marked a new stage in the development of the Soviet Union. Comrade Stalin's speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and other important documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have given unlimited encouragement to the great struggle of the people of the world for lasting peace, for people's democracy, and for socialism. We should strive to study and understand the basic ideas in these documents as the guide for our struggle against imperialism and for building a new life. October 28, 1952

    “中苏友好月”宣传要点
    中苏友好协会总会
    （一）三十五年来苏联的伟大成就
    （1）伟大的十月社会主义革命开辟了人类历史的新纪元，开始了从资本主义旧世界进入社会主义新世界的根本转变。从那时候起，三十五年来，苏联人民胜利地建成了社会主义社会，创造了没有人剥削人的新社会制度；在世界反法西斯战争中，苏联人民和苏联军队取得了伟大卫国战争的胜利，因而从德、意、日法西斯奴役下解救了人类，并为全世界人民争取持久和平与人民民主的事业开辟了宽广的道路；现在苏联人民又为第五个五年计划而奋斗，向着无限幸福的共产主义社会前进。这一切都是苏联人民在伟大的列宁和斯大林的领导下取得的具有世界历史意义的无可比拟的伟大胜利；这一切都无限地鼓舞了全世界劳动人民，增强了他们为争取自己解放、为社会主义和共产主义的远大前途而斗争的信心。
    （2）在一九一七年十月社会主义革命中，俄国共产党所领导的俄国工人阶级，联合广大的劳苦群众，取得了对资本家和地主的胜利，推翻了资产阶级政权，建立了无产阶级专政，巩固了工农联盟。十月革命废除了地主土地所有制，把全国一切土地收归国有，并把土地转交农民使用；废除了资产阶级的剥削制度，把工厂、铁路和银行变成了全体人民所有的财产。这样，就在世界上破天荒地出现了第一个新式的社会主义国家，在世界六分之一的土地上冲破了资本主义的锁链。
    （3）在十月社会主义革命后，苏联人民粉碎了英、美、法、日等帝国主义国家的武装干涉，肃清了国内反革命的叛乱。以后，又经过了恢复国民经济的时期，进一步地为实现社会主义的国家工业化而斗争，并在国家工业化的基础上，为实行农业集体化而斗争，经过几次的伟大的斯大林的五年计划，把苏联建设成为极其富强的社会主义国家。
    （4）从一九四一年六月起，苏联人民在斯大林和苏联共产党的领导下，为粉碎德国希特勒法西斯匪军的侵略，进行了伟大的卫国战争。经过了四年的血战，英勇的苏联军队终于完全粉碎了希特勒匪军，并且一直打到德国京城柏林，迫使法西斯德国无条件投降。这个战争的结果，欧洲的许多在希特勒法西斯奴役下的国家都得到了解放。一九四五年八月，强大的苏联军队又消灭了占领我国东北的日本侵略军主力关东军，并解放了朝鲜北部，迫使日本侵略者无条件投降。
    （5）在卫国战争结束以后，苏联立即进行和平建设，经过第四个五年计划，使苏联的工业和农业生产很快地恢复并超过战前的水平，开始了一系列的举世无匹的伟大的建设工程（例如连接伏尔加河和顿河的列宁运河和土库曼大运河、南乌克兰运河、北克里米亚运河、古比雪夫水电站、斯大林格勒水电站等等）。从一九五一年起，苏联开始了第五个五年建设计划，使苏联国民经济走上新的巨大高涨，这是苏联在从社会主义走向共产主义的道路上又迈进了一大步。
    （6）苏联虽然在卫国战争时期遭受过希特勒匪军的破坏，但一九五一年的工业生产比起一九二九年，已增加到十二倍半以上；而资本主义各国的工业生产，即使靠了扩张军备的刺激，在同一时期内，却几乎仍然停滞在原来的水平。完全未受战争损害并利用战争发了横财的美国，工业生产也仅仅增加了一倍。这就证明了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的伟大的优越性，而资本主义制度的灭亡是不可避免的。
    （二）苏联对我国革命事业和我国建设的重大帮助
    （1）三十几年来，苏联对于中国的革命运动和中华人民共和国的建设事业的各种援助，完全证明毛泽东主席的著名论断：苏联利益与人类利益是一致的；同时也完全证明了毛泽东主席在“斯大林是中国人民的朋友”一文中所说的一段话：“中华民族和中国人民的解放事业，只有社会主义的国家，社会主义的领袖，社会主义的人民，社会主义的思想家、政治家、劳动者，才能真正援助；而我们的事业，没有他们的援助是不能取得最后胜利的。”
    （2）苏联于十月革命后即宣布废除了帝俄对中国的不平等条约。在中国一九二四年至一九二七年的大革命时期，苏联政府和人民给了中国革命以直接的帮助。一九三七年中国爆发抗日战争后，苏联不仅和我国订立了互不侵犯条约，而且积极地在军事物资方面给了我国以巨大援助，许多英勇的苏联航空员并直接参加了我国的抗日战争。一九四五年八月，苏联出兵歼灭了侵占我国东北的日本关东军，有决定性地帮助了我国人民取得了抗日战争的最后胜利。
    （3）一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国宣告成立之后，苏联是第一个立即宣布与我国建立外交关系的国家。接着，在斯大林大元帅与毛泽东主席的亲自参加下，中苏两国于一九五○年二月十四日缔结了“中苏友好同盟互助条约”，使两国七亿人民结成了牢不可破的强大同盟。同时，中苏两国签订了完全符合于我国利益的“关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定”和“关于贷款给中华人民共和国的协定”。此外，中苏两国还先后签订了一系列的有利于我国建设事业、有利于两国人民共同利益、以及有利于保卫远东和世界和平的各项协定。苏联对于我国的经济建设和文化建设，无论在财力上、物力上、技术的传授上和工作的指导上，都供给了伟大无私的援助。
    （4）自中华人民共和国成立以来，苏联一贯地在一切外交场合给我国以重大的支持。苏联和其他人民民主国家一起，在联合国及其他场合，进行了坚决的斗争，以揭露美国侵略我国及远东的阴谋，反对美国侵略朝鲜和占领我国的台湾，反对美国无理否认我国出席联合国的权利。这一切的斗争对于反对侵略战争和孤立美国战争贩子，起了很大的作用。
    （5）今年八、九月间，中苏两国又在莫斯科举行了会谈，讨论了有关两国关系的重要政治与经济问题。会谈结果，公布了中苏关于中国长春铁路移交中华人民共和国政府的公告，双方同意着手进行各种措施，以便苏联政府在一九五二年底以前将共同管理中国长春铁路的一切权利以及属于该铁路的全部财产无偿地移交给我国。在这次会谈中，我国鉴于日本自从拒绝缔结全面和约并与美国以及其他若干国家缔结片面和约后，因此未与中国和苏联订立和约，从而就造成了危害和平事业的条件并便利于日本侵略之重演的情势，提出了关于延长中苏共同使用中国旅顺口海军根据地期限的愿望，因为这是有利于保障远东和世界的和平与中国的安全的。苏联政府接受并同意我国这一提议，双方进行了换文。这一次会谈完全表明了苏联对于中苏友好同盟互助条约的义务是信守不渝的，苏联是东方与世界和平的伟大的保卫者。
    （三）加强中苏两国的友好互助合作同盟
    （1）为了保卫东方及世界的和平，为了保障我国的独立和安全，必须加强中苏友好互助合作同盟。事实已经证明：强大的中苏友好互助合作同盟，是防止日本和其他在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家的重新侵略、保卫东方与世界和平的有力保证。现在美帝国主义正在继续拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，阴谋扩大侵朝战争，并且仍然侵占着我国领土台湾；同时美帝国主义正在企图利用日本和德国的军国主义势力进行新的侵略战争。因此，加强中苏友好互助合作同盟就更有非常重大的意义。
    （2）为了巩固我国的革命胜利并迅速地发展我国的建设事业，必须加强中苏友好互助合作同盟。事实已经证明，没有苏联和国际革命力量的援助，不但中国革命的胜利是不可能的，而且中国建设事业的胜利也是不可能的。在中华人民共和国成立以来的三年中间，苏联政府和人民所已给予我国的各方面的巨大援助，是我国经济恢复工作得以顺利进行和迅速完成的一个重要条件。许多苏联专家在中国工作，对我国经济的迅速恢复和发展起了很大的作用。苏联政府和人民给予我国的援助是真诚无私的，是真正建立在兄弟般的友谊与平等互利的原则上面的。现在我国即将进入大规模的经济建设和文化建设，并需进一步建设我国的国防，在这一切方面，我们都将得到苏联更大的帮助，而使我们的建设事业能够得到完全的胜利。
    （四）学习苏联，学习马克思列宁主义
    （1）我们应当学习苏联的一切先进经验。苏联是最先进的社会主义国家，是我们的先生。我们必须向苏联好好学习。我们应当学习苏联进行计划经济的经验，学习苏联的工业建设和农业建设的经验，学习苏联的国防建设的经验，学习苏联关于国家建设的经验，学习苏联的科学技术工作的经验，学习苏联的文学艺术工作和文化教育工作的经验。中国三年来的建设工作证明，学习苏联的先进经验，是完全符合于我国建设的需要的，这种学习可以使我们少走许多弯路，而大大加快我国建设的速度。
    （2）我们应当学习苏联人民的爱国主义和国际主义的精神。苏联人民为了建设自己的祖国进行忘我的劳动，每一个人都努力使自己的劳动获得辉煌的成果，为祖国做出更多更大的贡献。在卫国战争时期，他们为保卫自己的祖国进行了英勇的奋不顾身的战斗。这些都表现了苏联人民的高度爱国主义精神。苏联人民一贯积极地关怀和支持各国劳动人民及一切被压迫民族的解放事业。第二次世界大战期间，苏联人民为了全世界各国人民反法西斯的共同事业，付出了巨大的代价。苏联的政府和人民一贯积极地给各兄弟国家以慷慨的和无私的援助。我国解放之后，许多苏联专家到我国来帮助我们的建设，他们忠心耿耿、全心全意的服务精神，使我们每个人都为之感动。这些都表现了苏联人民的伟大的国际主义精神。
    （3）苏联的革命和建设是在马克思、列宁主义的指导下，是在列宁、斯大林的直接领导下，而获得胜利的。苏联在一切工作上的经验，苏联人民的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，都是在马克思、列宁主义的思想指导下培养和发展起来的。在马克思、列宁主义指导下，苏联在科学和文学艺术上的成就，达到了世界上的最高峰。必须了解，学习苏联的各种先进经验是和学习马克思、列宁主义不可分开的，这两件事是统一的。毛泽东主席曾指出，中国最初是从俄国人那里学到马克思主义的，中国共产党是以苏联共产党为模范而建立和发展起来的。斯大林同志关于中国革命的学说对于中国共产党和中国革命的胜利有着不可估量的意义。我们因为学习了马克思、列宁主义而得到了革命的胜利。很显然的，今后我们要取得建设的胜利，就要更进一步地学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的革命理论。
    （4）斯大林同志最近发表的理论著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”是对于马克思、列宁主义发展的一个伟大的新贡献，它向全人类指明了由社会主义过渡到共产主义的具体道路。斯大林同志发现了现代资本主义的基本经济法则和社会主义的基本经济法则，并由此说明了社会主义对于资本主义的无可比拟的优越性。以斯大林同志的这个理论著作为纲领的苏联共产党第十九次代表大会，标志了苏联发展的新阶段。斯大林同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说，马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告，以及苏联共产党第十九次代表大会其他的重要文献，都对全世界人类争取持久和平、争取人民民主和争取社会主义的伟大斗争作了无限的鼓励。我们应当努力地学习和领会这些文献中的基本思想，作为我们的反对帝国主义和建设新生活的斗争的指导。  一九五二年十月二十八日
