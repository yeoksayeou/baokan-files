Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 22nd: While interrupting the Korean armistice negotiations, the American aggressors have intensified their bombing of peaceful residential areas in Pyongyang and Wonsan. On the evenings of the 16th and 19th, formations of U.S. Air Force heavy bombers once again carried out indiscriminate bombing of rural areas in the suburbs of Pyongyang, areas with no military targets, killing dozens of peaceful residents and destroying many civilian houses and crops.

	At the same time, the U.S. Air Force continuously attacked the Wonsan area and its nearby peaceful rural villages on the 13th, 14th, and 15th. During the bombing on the 15th, the U.S. Air Force concentrated on indiscriminately bombing the peaceful residential areas of Wonsan for two hours, dropping 380 bombs and a batch of time bombs, killing and wounding more than 100 residents and destroying more than 180 civilian houses and earthen dwellings, as well as large areas of farmland.

	The Korean people bitterly hate the bloody atrocities of the American aerial bandits. Vigilant against the American aggressors' conspiracy to undermine negotiations and expand the war of aggression, they have unanimously expressed their determination to fight the enemy with practical actions to actively support the front lines.

    美机续滥炸平壤元山
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】美国侵略者在中断朝鲜停战谈判的同时，加紧轰炸平壤和元山的和平居民区。侵朝美国空军重轰炸机编队在十六日晚和十九日晚，又向平壤市郊区毫无军事目标的农村地带进行狂轰滥炸，杀害了数十名和平居民，毁坏了很多民房和农作物。
    同时，美国空军在十三、十四、十五日，连续袭击元山地区及其附近的和平农村。美国空军在十五日的那次轰炸中，集中滥炸元山地区的和平居民区达二小时，投下了三百八十颗炸弹和一批定时炸弹，杀伤了居民一百多人，破坏了民房和土窟一百八十多所和大片田地。
    朝鲜人民切齿痛恨美国空中强盗的血腥暴行，他们警惕着美国侵略者破坏谈判扩大侵略战争的阴谋，一致表示要以积极支援前线的实际行动来打击敌人。
