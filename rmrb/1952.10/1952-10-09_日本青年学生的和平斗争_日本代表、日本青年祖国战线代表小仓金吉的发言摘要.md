    The Japanese militarists drove us, the Japanese people, into war, carried out armed aggression against China and Asia, forced the Asian people to hate and massacre each other, causing injury and death to millions of good people. The people of all Asia can never forget this brutal behavior of the Japanese militarists.
    We, the Japanese youth and students, and women, on the one hand, feel a great responsibility for this matter. At the same time, we also suffered the first cruel baptism of atomic bombs in the war waged by the militarists. Millions of Japanese compatriots and classmates were killed on the mainland and on the southern islands. The heavy burden of war weighed heavily on the youth and women, causing them to make great sacrifices. Therefore, all youth and women hate war and yearn for peace. The Japanese militarists finally failed in World War II, and we were extremely happy that this tiresome war stopped.
    However, the good times did not last long. Soon we were occupied by the United States, and in order to achieve the goal of dominating Asia, they remobilized us to join the war and serve as their cannon fodder. This July, U.S. Army officer Lieutenant Colonel Donald trained 1,000 police reserve troops in Gunma Prefecture, Somagahara, and sent them to the Korean front. One of the biggest goals of the U.S. occupation of Japan for seven years has been to collect Japanese youth as cheap mercenaries to serve the U.S. war aims.
    The democratic rights and freedoms of youth and women, which were exchanged for the blood of millions of people in World War II, have also been deprived.
    In order to build and expand military bases, vast tracts of land have been seized from farmers. There are 23 airports with an area of ​​more than 500 chobu (1 chobu equals 0.99 hectares) nationwide, covering a total of 124,800 chobu of land. The number of unemployed and underemployed in rural areas has reached 9 million. Trafficking in women and children is being carried out openly.
    With the rapid expansion of the military industry, the peace industry is nearing collapse, and 9 million unemployed and underemployed people are scattered in cities across the country. In factories, American-style slave labor is forcibly imposed, especially forcing youth and women to engage in military production with low wages. The workers in these factories are in a state of no human rights, where they are immediately fired as soon as they talk about peace. Students are subjected to American-style colonial war education, police intervention is openly carried out on campuses, and a spy network is organized under the direct command of the U.S. occupation authorities, completely losing academic freedom. Under such fascist rule, academics are mobilized for military research. Students are asked to assist in bacterial research at the Faculty of Science of the University of Tokyo and in gas mask research at the Faculty of Engineering. In late July of this year, the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, the guiding center of Japanese monopoly capitalists, announced that students who participate in peace movements and student movements will not be allowed to take any positions. More than 80% of students cannot study well due to working part-time to support themselves, and some students have died due to excessive blood selling. Many students have become guinea pigs on bacterial weapons experimental platforms.
    The U.S. occupying forces also brutally violate the purity of Japanese women. More than 80% of the women serving at Haneda Airport have been insulted by the atrocities of the U.S. military. There are more than 300,000 illegitimate children born as a result of the occupying forces' atrocities. These facts are insults added to the youth and women, and this is a humiliation that the Japanese nation cannot tolerate.
    The "Separate Peace Treaty with Japan" and the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" concluded in San Francisco last September are war treaties that enslave the Japanese people. From the many serious facts that we have personally experienced, we know that they are driving us as cannon fodder to kill each other with other nations. That is why we are fighting more seriously for a peaceful and happy future. Such shame and vicious conspiracies are absolutely not allowed. Now in Japan, the struggle against the revival of militarism and against conscription is a major issue related to the survival of the entire nation. Therefore, "Japanese youth will never take up guns again to fight with their Asian brothers" and "Women will never send their husbands, sons and lovers to the battlefield again" have become the common slogans of all Japanese youth, students, mothers and daughters. Currently, the signature campaign against the revival of militarism and against conscription is being carried out by trade unions, students, rural youth, religious youth, and women's groups, with a target of 20 million signatures. By September, more than 3 million signatures had been collected.
    This year's May Day saw 4 million workers, farmers, etc. in various parts of the country protesting against false independence and demanding peace and freedom, and conducting large-scale demonstrations. The youth and students stood at the forefront. At that time, Masao Takahashi was shot and killed by the bullets of armed police, losing his young and promising life. He had a note hidden on his body saying "Want freedom, want peace, want independence, want a beautiful life." These words are the beliefs of all Japanese youth and students.
    The resistance movement of the entire nation, with the working class as the vanguard and including youth, students, and farmers, has dealt a serious blow to the war plans of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries.
    Since the 13th recruitment of police reserves began in June this year, although it has been carried out for two months, there have been very few applicants. In Miyagi Prefecture, it was planned to recruit 60 people, but in its central city of Sendai, only three people were recruited. In Matsue City, Shimane Prefecture, only six people applied. This struggle has caused great turmoil and anxiety among the current 75,000 police reserve members. Recently, 45% of these members have been dismissed for opposing being U.S. mercenaries.
    These facts clearly show that no matter how the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries want to drive Japanese youth to the battlefield, their delusions will never be realized. In these practical actions, we youth and women deeply know that it is impossible to obtain peace, freedom, and independence without being liberated from the U.S. occupation. At the same time, we also firmly believe that this struggle is completely consistent with the struggle of all the people in Asia and the Pacific region to defend peace.
    We participated in this conference, which is of historical significance to the nations of Asia and the Pacific. We demand peace. In fraternal solidarity, we experienced many tearful scenes. How can the Asian nations with such fraternal friendship hate and massacre each other? War is the greatest evil. Therefore, we resolutely cannot allow the crimes committed by Japanese imperialism to be repeated. We must conduct a comprehensive peace treaty based on the Potsdam Declaration to replace the "Separate Peace Treaty with Japan" that is the source of mutual killings among our Asian brothers. Only in this way can we share future peace and happiness.
    From the bottom of my heart, I want to shout "Defend peace" and "Do not repeat the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki." I convey to you the determination and wishes of tens of millions of Japanese youth and mothers, and sincerely hope to unite more closely with the people of all nations in Asia and the Pacific region and advance towards the great struggle to defend peace!

    日本青年学生的和平斗争
    ——日本代表、日本青年祖国战线代表小仓金吉的发言摘要
    日本军国主义者将我们日本人民驱入战争，向中国及亚洲进行武装侵略、迫使亚洲人民自相仇视与惨杀，使千百万善良的人们遭受伤亡，全亚洲人民是永远不能忘记日本军国主义者这种残暴行为的。
    我们日本的青年学生和妇女一方面对于此事感到有重大的责任，同时我们在军国主义者所进行的战争中，也曾受到残酷的原子弹的最初洗礼，数百万的日本同胞和同学在大陆上和南方的岛屿上被杀掉。战争的重担沉重地压在青年和妇女身上，使他们付出重大的牺牲。因此青年和妇女无不憎恨战争、渴望和平。日本军国主义者终于在第二次世界大战中失败了，这种令人厌倦的战争的停止使我们高兴极了。
    但是，好景不常，不久我们就被美国占领，他们为了达到统治亚洲的目的，又重新动员我们投入战争，做他们的炮灰。今年七月美军军官多纳德中校在群马县、相马原所训练的一千名警察后备队已出动到朝鲜前线，七年间美国占领日本的最大目的之一，就是收罗日本青年做廉价的雇佣兵，为美国的战争目的而服务。
    在第二次大战中以数百万人的鲜血所换得的青年和妇女的民主权利和自由也被剥夺了。
    为了建设与扩充军事基地，从农民手中夺取了广大的土地。仅五百町步（一町步等于○·九九公顷）以上的机场，在全国就有二十三处，共占土地十二万四千八百町步。农村中的失业者和半失业者已达九百万人。贩卖妇女和儿童等现象在公开进行着。
    随着军需工业的急速扩大，和平工业近于崩溃，九百万的失业者与半失业者散布在全国各都市。在工厂里强行美国式的奴隶劳动，特别是以低工资迫使青年、妇女从事军需生产。这些工厂内的工人陷入了只要一谈和平便立刻被解雇的没有丝毫人权的状态中。学生受着美国式殖民地战争教育，在学园中公然实行警察干涉，在美国占领当局直接指挥下组织了间谍网，完全失去了学术自由。在这样法西斯统治中，学术被动员来进行军事研究。要学生协助在东京大学理学院进行细菌研究，在工学院研究防毒面具。今年七月下旬，日本独占资本家的指导中心的日本经济团体联合会宣布，凡是参加和平运动和学生运动的学生，不让他们就任一切职务。百分之八十以上的学生由于半工半读不能很好学习，有的学生由于卖血过多而死亡。很多学生变成了细菌武器实验台上的豚鼠。
    美国占领军又凶暴地侵害日本妇女的纯洁，单在羽田机场服务的妇女就有百分之八十以上曾被美军的暴行侮辱过。由于占领军的暴行而产的私生子有三十万人以上。这些事实就是加在日本青年和妇女身上的侮辱，这是日本民族不能忍耐的屈辱。
    去年九月在旧金山缔结的“对日单独和约”和“日美安全保障协定”，是奴役日本人民的战争条约。从我们亲身体验的许多严重的事实中，知道了他们正在驱使我们当作炮灰去和其他民族互相残杀。因此我们才更认真地为和平幸福的未来而斗争着。对于这样的耻辱和凶恶的阴谋是绝对不能容许的。现在在日本反对军国主义复活和反对征兵的斗争是关系全民族生存的重大问题。因此“日本青年再不拿起枪来与亚洲的兄弟作战”，“妇女们再不把丈夫、儿子和爱人送到战场上去”等已经成为全日本青年学生、母亲、女儿们的共同口号。现在反对军国主义复活和反对征兵的签名运动，正以二千万票为目标，由工会、学生、农村青年、宗教青年和妇女团体等募集着，到九月间签名的已有三百万人以上。
    今年的五一节在全国各地有四百万工人农民等反对假独立、要求和平、自由而进行大规模的示威运动。青年学生站到最前线，当时高桥正夫被武装警察的凶弹射杀，失去了他年青有望的生命，在他的身上藏着“要自由、要和平、要独立，要美好的人生”的字条，这些话正是全日本青年学生的信念。
    以工人阶级为先锋的包括青年学生、农民在内的全民族的反抗运动给予美、日反动派的战争计划以严重的打击。
    自今年六月开始的第十三次募集警察后备队，虽然进行了两个月，但应募者寥寥无几。在宫城县预定募集六十名，但在其中心仙台市却只募集到三人。在岛根县的松江市只有六人应募。这一斗争已引起现在警察后备队七万五千余人大大的动摇和不安。最近这些队员中已有百分之四十五因反对当美国雇佣兵而被开除。
    这些事实很清楚地说明了无论美、日反动派怎样想驱逐日本青年上战场，但是他们的这种妄想是绝不会实现的。在这些实际行动中，我们青年和妇女深深知道不从美国占领下解放出来，就不可能获得和平、自由和独立。同时我们也深信这一斗争和亚洲及太平洋区域全体人民保卫和平的斗争是完全一致的。
    我们参加了对亚洲及太平洋各民族有历史意义的这个会议，我们要求和平，在兄弟般的亲密团结中，我们体验到很多使人落泪的场面。有着这样兄弟般的友情的亚洲各民族怎样能够互相憎恨、互相屠杀呢？战争是最大的罪恶。因此我们断然不能允许重复日本帝国主义所犯过的罪恶。我们必须根据波茨坦宣言进行全面和约以代替成为我们亚洲兄弟互相残杀根源的“对日单独和约”。也只有这样，我们才能共享未来的和平和幸福。
    我从心里要高呼“拥护和平”“不再重复广岛和长崎的悲剧”。我将数千万日本青年和母亲的决心和愿望向诸位传达，衷心地希望和亚洲及太平洋区域各民族人民更加紧密地团结起来向伟大的保卫和平斗争前进！（新华社）
