    Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference Sixth Morning
    Peace Representatives from Various Countries Continue to Speak
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The sixth day of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference began at 9:40 AM on the 7th.
    The executive chairmen of the morning session were: Madame Lai Pu Wu (Australia), U Ba Yin (Burma), Hugh B. Hester (United States), Jorge Enrique Bayona (Colombia), and Kinuko Kenta (Japan).
    Under the chairmanship of Executive Chairman U Ba Yin, the conference continued to hear speeches from representatives of various countries.
    During the morning session, peace representatives from the following six countries spoke: Philippines, Cyprus, Malaya, Peru, Pakistan, and Colombia.
    Manuel Cruz, the representative from the Philippines, was the first to speak. He painfully recalled the bloody history of how American imperialists, following the Spanish, transformed the Philippines into an American colony through large-scale burning, killing, and torture. He pointed out that although American imperialists are now directing the Philippine government to brutally suppress the local people's national liberation movement and peace movement, the movement continues to develop. The Filipino people, who had suffered the ravages of Japanese imperialism, resolutely oppose the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" and have forced the Philippine government to refrain from ratifying the treaty until now. In his speech, Cruz put forward the demands of the Filipino people: complete independence, free from American constraints; the establishment of a democratic government; the development of normal cultural exchanges and economic relations with other countries; and freedom from the threat of war.
    Styrianos Jacovides, a peace representative from the island of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean, then took the stage to speak (an abstract of his speech will be published separately).
    Then, Ms. Zeng Xuehong, the representative from Malaya, spoke (an abstract of her speech will be published separately).
    After Zeng Xuehong's speech, Mrs. Felton and Dr. Montague from Britain walked onto the stage with flowers and presented them to Zeng Xuehong and another Malayan representative, Lian Xun. Amidst the warm applause of peace fighters from Asian and Pacific countries, they embraced tightly.
    The next speaker was Mario Chiappra, head of the Peruvian delegation and an industrialist (an abstract of his speech will be published separately).
    After a short break, the meeting listened to a speech by Mazhar Ali Khan, the Pakistan representative and editor of the Pakistan Times (an abstract of his speech will be published separately), expressing the peaceful aspirations of the 80 million people of Pakistan. In his speech, Ali Khan pointed out that war-mongers, in order to undermine the peace movement, slander the peace movement as "propaganda." He then proceeded to vigorously refute this slander. He said: If you say we are doing propaganda, one of our main goals is indeed propaganda. What we are promoting is creative labor and a peaceful and happy life, not the promotion of atomic bombs. If we can spread peace propaganda to the farthest reaches, the warmongers will have nothing to do. We are many, they are few. Let the truth be known to the world, victory is ours, victory belongs to peace.
    The Colombian representative, former minister and ambassador to foreign countries, Salamia, spoke to the conference on behalf of the Colombian delegation (an abstract of his speech will be published separately). Salamia particularly mentioned his impression of New China. The Colombian delegation praised the Chinese people's brilliant contributions to the cause of peace with sincere and moving enthusiasm, and highly praised the happy life of the Chinese people under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong.
    The speeches of the representatives of various countries were warmly applauded and welcomed by all those present.
    Before the adjournment of the morning session, Deputy Secretary-General Hai announced that the conference had received congratulatory telegrams from the International Student Union, World Peace Council Standing Committee member Faji, the famous American historian Du Bois, the Hungarian National Peace Council, the Secretary-General of the Italian National Peace Council and former cabinet minister Sereni, the All-China Students' Federation, the Australian peace representatives who were denied passports and remained in the country, the Bengal Provincial Branch of the All-India Trade Union Congress, the East Pakistan Youth League, the Malang Branch of the Indonesian Peace Committee, the New Zealand Railway Workers' Union, and the Nicaraguan Peace Committee. These were warmly welcomed by the whole audience.

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第六日上午
    各国和平代表继续发言
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第六日会议在七日上午九时四十分开始举行。
    上午会议的执行主席是：赖普吾夫人（澳大利亚），宇巴迎（缅甸），休·赫第曼（美国），乔治·恩里克·巴约纳（哥伦比亚），金子健太（日本）。
    会议在执行主席宇巴迎主持下，继续听取各国代表的发言。
    在上午会议上发言的，有菲律宾、塞浦路斯、马来亚、秘鲁、巴基斯坦、哥伦比亚这六个国家的和平代表。
    菲律宾代表马纽尔·柯鲁兹第一个发言。他沉痛地回溯了美帝国主义者继西班牙人之后，用大规模的烧杀和毒刑把菲律宾变为美国殖民地的血腥历史。他指出：尽管美帝国主义现正指使菲律宾政府对当地人民的民族解放运动与和平运动进行残暴的镇压，但是运动仍然继续发展。曾遭受日本帝国主义蹂躏的菲律宾人民。坚决反对旧金山对日“和约”，迫使菲律宾政府直到现在还不敢批准这个和约。柯鲁兹在发言中提出菲律宾人民的要求：不受美国的束缚，完全独立；成立民主政府；与其他国家发展正常的文化交流与经济关系；不受战争的威胁。
    来自东地中海塞浦路斯岛的和平代表斯第里安诺斯·杰柯维德斯接着上台讲话（发言摘要另发）。
    然后，马来亚的女代表曾雪虹发言（发言摘要另发）。
    曾雪虹发言后，英国的费尔顿夫人和蒙塔古博士携着鲜花走上主席台，向曾雪虹和另一个马来亚代表连讯献花，在亚洲及太平洋各国和平战士的热烈掌声中，他们紧紧地拥抱在一起。
    接着发言的是秘鲁代表团团长、工业家马里奥·齐亚布拉（发言摘要另发）。
    会议在短暂的休息后，听取巴基斯坦代表、巴基斯坦时报主笔马兹哈·阿里汗发言（发言摘要另发），表达巴基斯坦八千万人民的和平意愿。阿里汗在发言中指出：战争贩子们为了破坏和平运动，而污蔑和平运动是“宣传”。他接着就对这种污蔑加以有力的驳斥。他说：说我们宣传，我们的主要目的之一就是宣传。我们宣传的是创造性的劳动与和平幸福的生活，而不是宣传原子弹。我们如果能把和平宣传传播到最远，战争贩子就将无所作为。我们人多，他们人少。让真理大白于天下罢，胜利是我们的，胜利归于和平。
    哥伦比亚代表，前部长和驻外大使萨拉米亚代表哥伦比亚代表团向大会发言（发言摘要另发）。萨拉米亚特别提到对新中国的印象。哥伦比亚代表团在这里以真挚动人的热情，赞扬中国人民对和平事业的辉煌贡献，并极力赞美中国人民在伟大领袖毛泽东主席英明领导下所过的幸福生活。
