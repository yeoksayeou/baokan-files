Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: News: According to official materials, the number of illegal incidents during the current Japanese general election campaign has broken the record of all post-war Japanese general elections.

According to the Japanese National Local Police Headquarters, as of late night on October 3, 3,208 illegal incidents have been discovered, and more than 10,000 people have been arrested, including more than 7,700 suspected of bribing voters.

Among these more than 3,000 illegal cases, the Liberal Party committed the most, totaling 1,636 cases. Even cabinet ministers of the Yoshida government used illegal means to obtain votes during the election. The scandals of Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki during the campaign have been initially exposed. Personnel from Katsuo Okazaki's campaign office used bribery and other illegal campaign tactics to campaign for Okazaki Katsuo. They once invited 1,000 people to a gathering under the guise of celebrating the opening of the campaign office, and Okazaki Katsuo personally attended the meeting and asked everyone to "help and support." Recently, the police authorities have had to arrest the person in charge of Okazaki Katsuo's campaign office and some other personnel.

Obviously, the cases of the Liberal Party's illegal campaigning announced by the police authorities are only a small part of the Liberal Party's scandals during the campaign. However, people can already see from it how the Liberal Party obtained its weak "majority" of seats in the Diet.

    日本大选违法事件达三千多件
    自由党在竞选中的丑行最多
    【新华社七日讯】东京消息：仅仅根据官方的材料，在这次日本大选的竞选运动中所发生的违法案件，其数字打破了战后日本历届大选的纪录。
    据日本国家地方警察本部宣布，截至十月三日深夜为止，已被发现的违法案件达三千二百零八件，因此而被逮捕的人已达一万名以上，其中七千七百多人有贿买选票的嫌疑。
    在这三千多件违法案件中，自由党所犯的最多，共达一千六百三十六件。即使是吉田政府的内阁大臣，在竞选中也同样是利用不法手段来取得选票的。外务相冈崎胜男在竞选中的丑行已被初步暴露出来。冈崎胜男的竞选办事处的人员，使用行贿和其他不合法的竞选手段为冈崎胜男竞选。他们曾经以庆祝竞选办事处开幕为名义，邀请了一千人举行大会，冈崎胜男亲自到会要求大家“帮忙和支持”。最近，警察当局已经不得不把冈崎胜男的竞选办事处的负责人和其他一些人员逮捕起来。
    显然，警察当局所公布的自由党违法竞选的案件仅不过是自由党在竞选中的丑行的一小部分而已。但是，人们已经可以从其中看到自由党的微弱的
    “多数”国会议席是怎样取得的。
