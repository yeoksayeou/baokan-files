The people of major cities across the country warmly celebrated the third National Day.

In Shanghai, 850,000 people gathered and paraded on the 1st to celebrate National Day. The city-wide parade was centered on People's Square (formerly the racecourse), and took place in seventeen districts. People's Square was newly decorated, and the thousands of red flags waving in the wind filled the square with a solemn and joyous atmosphere. The meeting began at exactly 10:00 AM. First, Tan Zhenlin, Vice Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, gave a speech, followed by the parade. The parade was led by a red flag team and 15,000 commanders and fighters from the People's Liberation Army's army, navy, and air force, followed by a team of more than 200,000 workers, students, women, industrialists and merchants, religious figures, and ethnic minorities from the central urban area. At the same time as the parade began in the city center, celebration parades were also held in sixteen urban districts throughout the city. From the Bund all the way to Nanjing Road in Jing'an Temple, a distance of more than ten *li*—where heroes shed their blood during the "May 30th" Movement in 1925—today, the vast parade and tens of thousands of spectators crowded the entire street, and the windows and rooftops of tall buildings throughout the city were filled with people. Shouts of slogans and songs broadcast from loudspeakers were intertwined.
