Xinhua News Agency, October 16th: The movement of non-white people in the Union of South Africa against the Malan government's racial discrimination laws is developing further.

    African National Congress General Secretary Sisulu stated on the 5th that the South African people's movement against racial discrimination laws has entered a new stage. The resistance movement has expanded to more and more areas, and the number of people volunteering to participate in the resistance action is increasing daily. A large number of non-white people, disregarding the Malan government's frantic suppression, continue their heroic struggle. According to a United Press International dispatch from Johannesburg on the 6th, the number of people arrested for participating in the resistance movement has increased to more than 5,200.

    Organizations leading the movement against racial discrimination laws are actively carrying out activities throughout the country. On October 5th, the Orange Free State branch of the African National Congress held its 40th Congress. African National Congress General Secretary Sisulu said at the meeting that the National Congress would mobilize the local people in Swaziland, Bechuanaland, and Basutoland to intensify their struggle and would never yield to the Malan fascist government.

    The Transvaal branch of the African National Congress also convened a conference in Pretoria on the 10th. Reverend Tants, chairman of the branch, pointed out at the conference that the movement against racial discrimination laws has united the African people and strengthened their cooperation. Before the meeting, many non-white people marched in the city, holding flags that read "Fight for Freedom" and singing African songs, demanding that Africa be returned to Africans.

    领导反抗种族歧视法令运动的组织正在全国各地积极展开活动。十月五日，非洲人国民大会奥兰治自由邦分会举行了第四十次大会，非洲人国民大会总书记西苏鲁在会上说，国民大会将在斯威士兰、贝专纳和巴苏陀兰发动当地人民加紧斗争，决不向马兰法西斯政府屈服。
