Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 29th—In the past half month, U.S. military aircraft invading Korea have continued to frantically violate our Northeast airspace, and have carried out barbaric strafing over Dadonggou Town in Andong County.

From September 12th to September 26th, in half a month, U.S. planes violated our Northeast airspace a total of 167 batches, 1,040 sorties. During this period, U.S. planes invaded areas that penetrated deep into Benxi and Fushun cities in the interior of Northeast China, as well as the airspace over Andong City, Kuandian, Fengcheng, Andong, Xiuyan, Zhuanghe, Ji'an, Linjiang, Xinbin, Changbai counties in Liaodong Province, and Hunchun and Helong cities and counties in Jilin Province. Among the U.S. planes that intruded into our Northeast airspace on September 21st, eight flew over Dadonggou Town in Andong County, Liaodong Province, to carry out strafing.

Our people express infinite indignation and serious protest against the U.S. aggressors' increasingly intensified violations of our Northeast airspace and their conspiracy to expand the war of aggression.

    自九月十二日到九月二十六日半个月间，美机侵犯我东北领空共达一百六十七批，一千零四十架次。在此期间，美机入侵地区曾深入到我国东北内地的本溪、抚顺两市，以及辽东省安东市、宽甸、凤城、安东、岫岩、庄河、辑安、临江、新宾、长白和吉林省的珲春、和龙等市、县境上空。在九月二十一日侵入我东北领空的美机中，有八架曾飞至我辽东省安东县大东沟镇上空施行扫射。
