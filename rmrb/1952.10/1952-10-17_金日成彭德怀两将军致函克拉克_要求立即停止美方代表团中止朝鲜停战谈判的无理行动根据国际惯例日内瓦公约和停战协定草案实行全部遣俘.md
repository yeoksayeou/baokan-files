Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th – General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, wrote a letter to General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, on the 16th. The full text is as follows:

To General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command:

At a time when people all over the world, including the American people, are longing for peace in Korea, and when the Korean armistice negotiations have almost reached a full agreement, your delegation, on October 8, 1952, disregarded the proposals of our delegation and suddenly unilaterally announced an indefinite adjournment, refusing to negotiate and suspending the talks. This unreasonable action alone is sufficient to prove that your side has no sincerity in the Korean armistice and should bear full responsibility for sabotaging the armistice negotiations.

The Korean armistice negotiations have been going on for fifteen months. During these fifteen months, your side has put forward various unreasonable demands, such as drawing the military demarcation line into our hinterland, dispatching military personnel after the armistice to conduct land and air inspections of the rear areas, interfering with our construction of airports, etc. At the same time, you have continuously violated the neutrality agreement within the conference area, used so-called military pressure outside the conference, and even used bacteriological bombs, napalm bombs, and poison gas bombs to bomb peaceful residents and peaceful towns and cities, attempting to force us to submit. However, what your side cannot obtain on the battlefield, you will never obtain at the conference table. Your side's unreasonable actions and attempts have already failed and will continue to fail.

On our side, during these fifteen months, we have made great efforts and patience, adhered to fair and reasonable principles, and finally completed sixty-three articles of the draft armistice agreement, including nine articles of agreement on the issue of prisoner arrangements. If your side had not deliberately obstructed the issue of prisoners, the Korean armistice would have been realized long ago, North and South Korea would have restored peace long ago, and prisoners of war on both sides would have returned home to live peaceful lives long ago.

The principle your side upholds on the issue of prisoners is so-called "no forced repatriation," but this principle has no legal basis and no factual basis. It is entirely an excuse manufactured by your side to delay and sabotage the negotiations. As everyone knows, prisoners of war are completely different from political exiles. Therefore, the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War specifically stipulates in its Article 118 that "prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities," and further stipulates in its Article 7 that "prisoners of war may in no circumstances renounce in part or in entirety the rights secured to them by the present Convention." These provisions are clearly to prevent the occurrence of inhumane acts in which opposing sides, after the armistice, use the so-called "voluntary principle" as an excuse to forcibly detain prisoners of war and refuse to repatriate them home. In fact, in past international wars, both sides fully repatriated prisoners of war after the armistice. Therefore, your delegation had no choice but to agree to such clauses in the draft Korean armistice agreement, namely: "All prisoners of war held in custody by each side at the time this Armistice Agreement becomes effective shall be released and repatriated as expeditiously as possible" (Article 51), "Each side shall be responsible for completing the repatriation of all prisoners of war held in its custody as early as possible within the said time limit (referring to within two months after the armistice agreement comes into effect)" (Article 54).

According to international practice, according to the provisions of the Geneva Convention, and even more so according to the clauses already agreed upon by you and us in the draft Korean armistice agreement, your side has no reason to oppose the principle that prisoners of war on both sides should be fully repatriated. However, your side insists that our captured personnel actually do not wish to reunite with their beloved families and live peaceful lives, but instead demand to be exiles and cannon fodder under the tyranny of the enemy, which is notorious for its darkness, which they have always opposed. This is completely contrary to the common sense of normal people and is therefore completely unbelievable. To expose this fabricated statement by your side, it is sufficient to cite the facts that our captured personnel in your prisoner-of-war camps are still being massacred, abused, tattooed, and forcibly fingerprinted every day, and that they are protesting against these atrocities. The letters from your Brigadier General Colson to our captured personnel are concrete proof of these facts.

When discussing the classification of prisoners of war, in view of your side's proposal that some prisoners of war on both sides of Korea have families in the area held by the detaining side, our side proposed to re-correct the lists according to the principle of classification by nationality and region, namely: all captured foreign armed personnel, i.e., captured personnel of the United Nations forces or the Chinese People's Volunteers, should be fully repatriated home; all captured Korean armed personnel, i.e., captured personnel of the South Korean army or the Korean People's Army, should be fully repatriated home if their families are in the area originally belonging to their side, and those whose families are in the area held by the detaining side may be allowed to return home on the spot without being repatriated. The draft Korean armistice agreement also stipulates that "the release and repatriation of such prisoners of war shall be carried out in accordance with the lists exchanged and corrected by both sides before the signing of this Armistice Agreement" (Article 51) "Each side guarantees that all prisoners of war released and repatriated as a result of the entry into effect of this Armistice Agreement shall not be used in acts of war in the Korean conflict" (Article 52). However, when actually correcting the lists, your side twice did not follow the classification principle proposed by our side, but instead implemented a so-called "screening principle" among the prisoners, which is actually forced detention, completely violating the Geneva Convention and the draft Korean armistice agreement regarding the repatriation of all prisoners of war and guaranteeing that they return home to live peaceful lives.

Therefore, neither your so-called "voluntary principle" nor your "screening principle" can be found in any basis in international practice, the Geneva Convention, or even the draft Korean armistice agreement that you and we have already reached. On the contrary, the principle that prisoners of war on both sides should be fully repatriated home, which we insist on, is a principle recognized by the world. It is only because your side stubbornly adheres to your unreasonable principle that the only remaining issue in the Korean armistice negotiations, namely the repatriation of prisoners of war, has been delayed for five months since May of this year without any solution. Recently, because the people of the world, especially the people of the Asia-Pacific region, are increasingly impatient with the delay in the Korean armistice negotiations, even the American people believe that interfering in the Korean War is a "hated war," and the United Nations General Assembly and the US presidential election are approaching, your delegation then proposed three prisoner repatriation plans on September 28, deliberately making a mystery and attempting to deceive the world with the words "complete repatriation." But in essence, these plans still run through your so-called "no forced repatriation," which is actually the unreasonable demand for forced detention. At the same time, without waiting for an agreement to be reached on the issue of prisoner repatriation, your side unilaterally handled our captured personnel without authorization, which shows that even the plans you proposed yourselves, you are not prepared to implement.

But on our side, in order to adhere to our principle of peacefully resolving the Korean issue and to satisfy the world's people's desire for a Korean armistice, regardless of how unacceptable the principles of the three plans proposed by your side are, we still adopted some reasonable components of your side's proposal and put forward our new proposal on October 8. Based on the just demand that prisoners of war on both sides should be fully repatriated home to live peaceful lives, our side proposed that after the armistice agreement comes into effect, all prisoners of war on both sides can be transported to the exchange point agreed upon by both sides in the demilitarized zone and handed over to the other side for reception, as proposed by your side; after reception, they should be visited by the joint Red Cross groups in accordance with Article 57 of the draft Korean armistice agreement, as proposed by your side, to explain to the prisoners of war on both sides and guarantee that they return home to live peaceful lives and no longer participate in the Korean War; then, the classification should be carried out according to the aforementioned principle of classification by nationality and region proposed by our side, and the repatriation should be carried out after classification. The work of exchange, visitation, classification, and repatriation can be carried out under the observation of the neutral nations supervisory teams.

Our above proposal is fully in line with the provisions of the Geneva Convention and the draft Korean armistice agreement. At the meeting of delegations on both sides on October 8, your delegation not only ignored this reasonable proposal from our side and refused to discuss it, but immediately read out a statement that had been prepared long ago, unilaterally announced an indefinite adjournment, and even left the meeting hall halfway without waiting for our reply, resolutely suspending the Korean armistice negotiations that the world is concerned about. Your delegation's unreasonable action of sabotaging the negotiations was clearly premeditated. Your side may be attempting to pressure the United Nations General Assembly to endorse your side's scheme to violate international conventions, sabotage armistice negotiations, and expand the war, but it can be asserted that the peace-loving people of the world will never allow your side's scheme to succeed.

The situation is very clear, but we are still willing to make the greatest efforts to promote the Korean armistice, and hereby put forward the following demands to you:

One, immediately stop your delegation's unreasonable action of suspending the armistice negotiations;

Two, it is imperative to implement full repatriation of prisoners of war based on international practice, the 1949 Geneva Convention, and the draft Korean armistice agreement that both sides have already agreed upon. The specific implementation methods and steps can be negotiated during the negotiations;

Three, quickly realize the Korean armistice based on the draft Korean armistice agreement.

If your side still has the slightest sincerity in the Korean armistice and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, you should give an affirmative answer to our above reasonable demands.

The peace-loving people and countries of the world are watching your side's actions.

Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers

    金日成彭德怀两将军致函克拉克
    要求立即停止美方代表团中止朝鲜停战谈判的无理行动
    根据国际惯例日内瓦公约和停战协定草案实行全部遣俘
    【新华社开城十六日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军，在十六日写信给联合国军总司令克拉克，全文如下：联合国军总司令克拉克将军：
    在全世界人民包括美国人民在内都渴望朝鲜实现和平的今天，在朝鲜停战谈判几乎已达成全部协议的时候，你方代表团于一九五二年十月八日竟不顾我方代表团的提议，突然片面宣告无限期休会，拒绝协商，中止谈判。单就这一无理行动来说，已足够证明你方对于朝鲜停战毫无诚意，而且应该负起破坏停战谈判的全部责任了。
    朝鲜停战谈判已进行十五个月了。在这十五个月中，你方曾提出各种无理要求，如将双方军事分界线划入我方腹地，在停战后派遣军事人员进行对后方地区的陆上和空中视察，干涉我方修建机场等，同时并在会场区内不断破坏中立协议，在会外使用所谓军事压力，甚至使用细菌弹、凝固汽油弹和毒气弹，轰炸和平居民与和平城乡，企图以此来压迫我方屈服。但是，你方在战场上得不到的东西，同样在会场上也永远不能得到。你方这种无理的行动和企图，是已经失败了，而且仍将继续失败。
    而我们方面，在这十五个月中，却以极大的努力和忍耐，坚持公平合理的原则，终于使停战谈判完成了六十三款的停战协定草案，其中包括关于俘虏安排问题的九款协定。如果不是你方故意在俘虏问题上横加阻挠，则朝鲜停战必然早已实现，南北朝鲜必然早已恢复和平，双方战俘必然早已回家过和平生活了。
    你方在俘虏问题上所持的主张是所谓“不强迫遣返”，但是这个主张既无法理根据，也无事实根据，完全是你方为拖延和破坏谈判所制造出来的藉口。众所周知，战争中的俘虏，完全与政治流亡者不同，所以一九四九年关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约在其第一一八条中特别规定“实际战事停止后，战俘应即予释放并遣返，不得迟延”，而在其第七条中更确定“在任何情况下战俘不得放弃本公约……所赋予彼等权利之一部或全部”。这些规定，显然是在防止敌对双方在停战后藉口所谓“自愿原则”，强迫扣留战俘不予遣返回家的违反人道行为的发生的。实际上，在过去国际战争中，双方战俘于停战后均实行了全部遣返。因此，你方代表团在停战协定草案中也不得不同意这样的条款，即：“本停战协定生效时，各方所收容的全部战俘须尽速予以释放与遣返”（第五十一款），“在此期限内（按指停战协定生效后两个月内）各方负责在可能范围内尽早完成其收容下的全部战俘的遣返”（第五十四款）。
    根据国际惯例，根据日内瓦公约的规定，更根据你我双方在朝鲜停战协定草案中所已经达成协议的条款，你方已无任何理由可以反对双方战俘应予全部遣返的原则，但是你方硬说我方被俘人员竟有不愿与其亲爱的家人团聚过和平生活反而要求在他们素所反对的以黑暗著称于世的敌人的暴政下作流亡者和炮灰的表示，这是完全违反正常人的常识，因此是完全不足置信的。为揭穿你方这种虚构的说法，只要举出我方被俘人员在你方战俘营中直至今日仍在每日继续的被屠杀、被虐待、被刺字、被强盖指印以及他们对这些暴行抗议等事实已足够了。你方柯尔生准将致我方被俘人员的信件，就是这些事实的确切证明。
    在讨论到战俘分类时，鉴于你方曾提出朝鲜双方战俘有家在拘留一方地区者，我方乃提议按国籍地区分类原则，重新校正名单，即：双方所俘获的外国武装人员，即联合国军或中国人民志愿军被俘人员，全部遣返回家；双方所俘获的朝鲜武装人员，即南朝鲜军或朝鲜人民军被俘人员，其家在原属一方地区者全部遣返回家，其家在收容一方地区者可以许其就地回家，不必遣返。在朝鲜停战协定草案中，亦规定“此项战俘的释放与遣返，须按照本停战协定签字前双方所交换并校正的名单执行之”（第五十一款）“各方保证不将全部因本停战协定之生效而被释放与遣返的战俘用于朝鲜冲突中的战争行动”（第五十二款）。但当实际校正名单时，你方两次均不按我方所提分类原则，竟在俘虏中实行所谓“甄别原则”实即强迫扣留，完全违反日内瓦公约及朝鲜停战协定草案关于遣返全部战俘并保证其回家过和平生活的规定。
    因此，不论你方所谓“自愿原则”或“甄别原则”，在国际惯例及日内瓦公约中，甚至在你我双方已达成协议的朝鲜停战协定草案中，均找不到任何根据，相反的，我方所坚持的双方战俘应予全部遣返回家的主张，则为举世公认的原则。只是由于你方固执你方的无理主张，致使朝鲜停战谈判所剩下的唯一问题亦即战俘的遣返问题，从今年五月起，拖延五个月之久，得不到任何解决。最近，由于全世界人民首先是亚洲及太平洋区域的人民日益不耐于朝鲜停战谈判的拖延，就连美国人民也认为干涉朝鲜战争是一个“讨厌的战争”，而联合国大会及美国总统选举又已逼近，于是你方代表团乃于九月二十八日故弄玄虚地提出三种遣俘方案，企图以所谓“完全遣返”字样蒙混世人，但在实质上这些方案仍然贯穿着你方所谓“不强迫遣返”实即强迫扣留的无理要求。同时，你方又不待遣俘问题达成协议，便擅自片面处理我方被俘人员，由此可见，就连你们自己提出的方案，你们也并不准备实行的。
    但在我们方面，为坚守我方和平解决朝鲜问题的主张，并满足世界人民渴望朝鲜停战的要求，不管你方所提三种方案的原则如何不能接受，我们仍然采纳了你方提案中某些合理的成份，在十月八日提出了我方的新建议。根据双方战俘应予全部遣返回家过和平生活的正义要求，我方提议：在停战协定生效后，双方全部战俘，可照你方提议，运往非军事区中双方同意的交换地点，交给对方接收；在接收后，并照你方提议，按朝鲜停战协定草案第五十七款规定，由联合红十字会小组进行访问，向双方战俘解释，保证他们回家过和平生活，不再参加朝鲜战争；然后再根据前述的我方所提的按国籍地区分类原则进行分类，分类后即进行遣返。这种交换、访问、分类和遣返的工作，可在中立国视察小组观察之下进行。
    我方上述提案是完全符合于日内瓦公约和朝鲜停战协定草案的规定的。你方代表团在十月八日双方代表团大会上，不仅无视我方这一合理提案，拒绝讨论，而且立即宣读早已预备好了的声明，片面宣布无限期休会，更不待我方答复，即中途退出会场，断然中止了举世关心的朝鲜停战谈判。你方代表团这一破坏谈判的无理行动，显系预谋。你方可能企图以此压迫联合国大会赞同你方破坏国际公约，破坏停战谈判，扩大战争的诡计，但可断言，全世界爱好和平的人民绝不会容许你方的诡计得逞。
    情势已很明显，但我们仍愿为促成朝鲜停战尽最大的努力，现特向你提出下列要求：
    一、立即停止你方代表团中止停战谈判的无理行动；
    二、必须根据国际惯例、一九四九年日内瓦公约和双方业已达成协议的朝鲜停战协定草案实行全部遣俘，其具体实施方法与步骤可在谈判中进行协商；
    三、根据朝鲜停战协定草案，迅速实现朝鲜停战。
    如果你方对朝鲜停战及和平解决朝鲜问题尚有丝毫诚意，你即应对我们上述的合理要求给以肯定的回答。
    全世界爱好和平的人民和国家，都在注视着你方这一行动。
    朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成
    中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀
    一九五二年十月十六日
