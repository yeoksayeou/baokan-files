    Who can enter the Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School?
    Editor's Note: After the People's Daily published the "Decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Strengthening the Formal Education of Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Schools" on July 31, revolutionary disabled soldiers from all over the country wrote to support it, expressing their gratitude to the People's Government for their care and indicating that they would respond to the People's Government's love by studying hard. In addition, revolutionary disabled soldiers in different positions have also raised some questions, which are now answered separately as follows:
    Question: Can severely disabled revolutionary soldiers in revolutionary disabled soldiers' sanatoriums participate in studies at the Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School?
    Answer: Severely disabled persons in revolutionary disabled soldiers' sanatoriums, with the exception of a very few who are unable to participate in collective learning due to poor health and should be organized for recuperation and individual education, are welcome to transfer to the Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School if they are able to participate in collective learning and are willing to learn. They will be assigned to appropriate classes for study according to their level of education. If there are many such people in the sanatorium who can form their own classes for study within the sanatorium, they can also be formed into separate classes to implement appropriate formal education in order to take care of their physical conditions.
    Question: Can revolutionary disabled soldiers of the second-class grade A, whose health has recovered, participate in studies at the Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School?
    Answer: Although revolutionary disabled soldiers of the second-class grade A are classified as severely disabled, many of them can participate in formal studies at the Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School. As long as they are willing to participate, the Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Schools in various places should actively welcome them.
    Question: Can revolutionary disabled soldiers recuperating in sanatoriums participate in studies at the Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School? What are the procedures?
    Answer: Revolutionary disabled soldiers (including those disabled on duty) currently in sanatoriums who are willing to study can be introduced to the Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School in their place of origin to study after being examined and approved by the political organs of the unit and after contacting the civil affairs department of the People's Government of the soldier's original province.
    Question: Can revolutionary disabled soldiers who have been transferred to local government agencies, organizations, and enterprise departments enter the Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School?
    Answer: The study problems of revolutionary disabled soldiers who have been transferred to local government agencies, organizations, and enterprise departments should be handled according to the treatment of general local staff and workers, and should be solved with the help of the respective administrative systems. They are not included in the enrollment of the Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School.
    Question: Can revolutionary disabled soldiers who have returned to their hometowns return to the Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School to study?
    Answer: Due to the limitation of equipment conditions, the Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School cannot currently undertake the educational tasks of revolutionary disabled soldiers who have returned to their hometowns. The issue of study for revolutionary disabled soldiers in rural areas should be given importance in the social education in various places. When various training classes or vocational schools held by various departments under the people's governments at all levels enroll students, priority should be given to revolutionary disabled soldiers returning to their hometowns under the same conditions.

    那些人可以入革命残废军人学校？
    编者按：七月三十一日本报发表“中央人民政府政务院关于加强革命残废军人学校正规教育的决定”后，各地革命残废军人纷纷来信拥护，感谢人民政府对他们的关心，并表示要以努力学习来回答人民政府对他们的爱护。此外，不同岗位的革命残废军人还提出一些问题，现在分别答复如下：
    问：在革命残废军人教养院的重残废革命军人，是否可以参加革命残废军人学校学习？
    答：在革命残废军人教养院的重残废人员，除极少数因身体不好，不可能参加集体学习，宜组织休养并进行个别教育外，凡能够参加集体学习而本人又愿意学习的，均欢迎他们转入革命残废军人学校，根据他们的文化程度，编入适当的班次进行学习。如教养院中这类人员较多，能够在院中自行编班学习的，也可单独编班，实施适当的正规教育，以便照顾他们的身体条件。
    问：二等甲级残废革命军人，身体已经恢复健康，是否可以参加革命残废军人学校学习？
    答：二等甲级残废革命军人虽属于重残废范围，但其中有不少人是可以参加革命残废军人学校正规学习的。只要他们愿意参加，各地革命残废军人学校均应积极欢迎。
    问：在疗养院休养的革命残废军人，可否参加革命残废军人学校学习？手续怎样？
    答：现在疗养院中的革命残废军人（包括因公致残者），其本人愿意学习的，经部队政治机关审查批准，并与该军人原籍省人民政府民政部门联系后，可以介绍他到原籍革命残废军人学校学习。
    问：革命残废军人已经转入地方政府机关、团体和企业部门工作的，是否可以进革命残废军人学校？
    答：已经转入地方政府机关、团体和企业部门工作的革命残废军人，他们的学习问题，应按一般地方工作人员处理，由各该行政系统帮助解决，不在革命残废军人学校吸收之列。
    问：已经回乡的革命残废军人，是否可以回到革命残废军人学校学习？
    答：目前因设备条件的限制，革命残废军人学校尚不能担负起已经回乡的革命残废军人的教育任务。关于在乡革命残废军人学习问题，应在各地的社会教育中给以重视；各级人民政府所属各部门举办的各种训练班或专业学校招生时，在同等条件下，应优先照顾回乡的革命残废军人。
