    Conscientiously Inspect and Summarize Substitute Farming Work

    Due to the continued intensification of the Resist America, Aid Korea struggle and the unfolding of the patriotic production increase movement, this year's substitute farming work has achieved great results and made some new creations. In order to summarize experiences, improve work, and elevate rural substitute farming work a step further, all regions should comprehensively inspect and summarize substitute farming work in conjunction with the current autumn harvest movement and the upcoming campaign to select and commend exemplary families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. The focus of the inspection and summary should be the implementation of substitute farming policies, especially the yield of land cultivated on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, because the yield of land cultivated on their behalf is the main criterion for measuring the quality of substitute farming. Only when the yield of land cultivated on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers reaches or exceeds the production level of the general masses can their lives be reliably guaranteed. Therefore, in newly liberated areas, the situation and experience of promoting fixed substitute farming should be summarized and promoted, and in old liberated areas, the experience of combining substitute farming with mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives should be summarized. Secondly, in order to ensure increased yields from the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, various concrete measures and methods have been adopted in various regions, such as helping them formulate production increase plans, carrying out drought prevention and resistance, ensuring timely land cultivation, increasing fertilizer application, preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and improving agricultural technology. The results of the implementation of these methods and any experiences gained should be studied and summarized one by one. Thirdly, it is necessary to check whether the scope of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers enjoying substitute farming is too broad or too narrow, that is, the tendency to provide substitute farming to those who should not be provided with it, and to not provide substitute farming to those who should be provided with it, and appropriately plan the scope of substitute farming based on local conditions. At the same time, it is necessary to check whether there is an excessive exemption from substitute farming duties and an unfair burden of substitute farming duties, and based on the results of the inspection, propose plans and methods for improving substitute farming work next year.
    The inspection and summary should be carried out step by step from the bottom up, with the focus on townships (villages) and districts. During the inspection, a combination of leadership organs organizing inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections and launching mass appraisal campaigns can be adopted. In the mass appraisal movement, good deeds should be praised and encouraged, and bad deeds should be educated and criticized to enhance the masses' sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for substitute farming, and thereby discover models of substitute farming work.
    The "Instructions on Evaluating Models for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers, Disabled Revolutionary Soldiers, Demobilized Soldiers and Models for Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Soldiers" promulgated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government stipulates that a campaign to evaluate and commend models for preferential treatment should be conducted nationwide after the autumn harvest of 1952 and before the Spring Festival of 1953. Doing a good job in the inspection and summary of substitute farming work will prepare the ground for carrying out this campaign in rural areas, and at the same time further promote next year's substitute farming work. Therefore, the leading organs in various regions should attach importance to the leadership of this work, organize a certain amount of manpower, mobilize the broad masses, and conscientiously do a good job in this inspection and summary work.

    认真检查总结代耕工作
    由于抗美援朝斗争的继续加强和爱国丰产运动的开展，今年的代耕工作获得了很大的成绩，并有了一些新的创造。为了总结经验，改进工作，把农村代耕工作提高一步，各地应结合目前的秋收运动和即将开展的评选优抚模范的运动，全面地检查和总结一次代耕工作。检查总结的重点应该是代耕政策的执行情况，特别是给烈属、军属代耕土地的产量，因为代耕土地的产量是测量代耕好坏的主要标准。只有使烈属、军属土地的产量达到或超过了一般群众的生产水平，他们的生活才能获得可靠的保障。因此，在新区应总结推行固定代耕的情况和经验，老区应总结代耕和互助组或农业生产合作社相结合的经验。其次，各地为了保证烈属、军属的土地增加产量，曾采取了一些具体措施和办法，如帮助烈属、军属订增产计划，进行防旱抗旱，保证土地及时耕种，增施肥料，防治病虫害，提高农业技术，等等，这些办法实行的结果如何，有些什么经验，都应该逐一加以研究总结。第三，要检查烈属、军属享受代耕面是否有过宽过狭，即应代耕的未给代耕，不应代耕的反而给予代耕的偏向，并依据当地情况适当地规划代耕面。同时要检查一下有否免服代耕勤务过多和代耕勤务负担不公平的现象，并根据检查的结果，提出明年改进代耕工作的计划和办法。
    检查总结应该自下而上地逐级进行，重点应该放在乡（村）和区。在进行检查时，可以采用领导机关组织检查组深入检查，和发动群众展开评比运动相结合的方法。在群众的评比运动中，要对好的给予表扬鼓励，不好的给予教育批评，以提高群众对代耕的责任心和积极性；并从而发现代耕工作的模范。
    中央人民政府内务部公布的“关于评选烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员军人模范及拥军优属模范的指示”中，曾规定于一九五二年秋收以后，至一九五三年春节前后，在全国进行一次评选优抚模范的运动。作好代耕工作的检查总结将给农村开展这一运动作好准备，同时会进一步推动明年的代耕工作。因此各地的领导机关应重视这一工作的领导，组织一定力量，发动广大群众，把这一次检查总结工作切实做好。
