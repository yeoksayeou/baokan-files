Preface to "Striving for New China"
Song Qingling

　　The Chinese revolution was a long, arduous, and complex struggle, and many, many people sacrificed themselves for this struggle. It is intricately woven into the lives of all the people and intertwined with the land of the motherland.

　　The victory of the Chinese revolution is one of the most significant events in history, with the same importance as the Great October Socialist Revolution. In the struggle for national independence and world security, they have jointly created many valuable experiences. They have also jointly planned the future world, when the idea of man exploiting man will become a historical record, and the atomic bomb will become a museum exhibit alongside clubs and earthen cannons.

　　In many ways, the Chinese revolution has its own uniqueness. Therefore, the more that is written about its deeds, the more benefits can be gained from its experiences. General Chen Yi and several other friends have advised me that if I could compile and publish my speeches, articles, and statements published since 1927, I could make a contribution in this regard. Because they believe that these writings reflect the revolutionary tide over the years, reflect the rise and fall of the people's power, and reflect the people's power finally breaking through everything and achieving victory. This collection is a part of what I have spoken and written in participating in the Chinese liberation struggle.

　　Only a part is collected here, because it is impossible to compile everything. Some manuscripts were lost in December 1941 when the Japanese invaders invaded Kowloon, Hong Kong, on my way from Kowloon to Chongqing for refuge. Therefore, when it came time to collect materials for this collection, in addition to the few articles published after the liberation of Shanghai, I had very little basic information to choose from. Although I have searched for the lost materials, I have not found much. Therefore, this book can only include a part of the writing.

　　Readers can see that from July 1927 to May 1949, many of the texts I published were aimed at foreign readers. Some of them were published during my visit to the Soviet Union: on the one hand, to express gratitude to the Soviet people for their encouragement and help to the Chinese revolutionary masses, and on the other hand, to express the determination to persist in the struggle until complete victory. The rest was mainly written by me to the British and American people in China through English newspapers and other available media at home and abroad. Of course, it has always been and still is very important today to make these two great peoples understand the situation in China and how the struggle here affects their own struggle for security and happiness. As for why I was in my own country at that time, but used the above method, there is another important reason. Because I stood on the side of the Chinese people, all avenues for me to speak to the masses were closed. Publishing and broadcasting were completely controlled by the reactionaries. They either suppressed my speeches or distorted and misinterpreted my meaning.

　　Although some Chinese publications could sometimes be used, and I also used them when necessary or when circumstances permitted; but when my opinions had to be spread as widely as possible, I had to rely on foreign newspapers and other foreign media. This method of mine sometimes forced the controlled publishing circles at that time to publish my statements. And this public dissemination method sometimes enabled the people to hear through their own channels.

　　Here, I want to explain that the fact that foreign publications and news agencies published my statements does not mean that they completely sympathize with the Chinese revolution or can let me speak freely. Of course, some foreign newspapers did regard our cooperation as part of a common struggle in the spirit of true internationalism. However, most foreign newspapers are spokespersons for imperialism, so they sometimes refuse to publish my texts, and sometimes even if they do, it is only for their own purposes, or for "sensationalism," or for "exclusive news."

　　In addition, the only medium through which I could express myself (especially in the mid-1930s) was through the English-language publications run in China by international friends of the Chinese people. These friends took the same revolutionary risks as their Chinese comrades. I am forever sincerely grateful for their contributions during this most difficult and dangerous period.

　　Today, the people have seized power, and the situation has completely changed. Anyone who stands on the revolutionary stand and is willing to issue a consistent voice with the people can use the most popular tools to express opinions in our own language and various other languages. Today, the truth can reach the masses' ears and eyes without restriction. I am preparing this collection with this thought in mind, and I hope it can help those who study the struggle of the Chinese people during this period.

　　Just as I was sorting out these manuscripts, the struggle entered a new stage. Those imperialist aggressors, led by American bankers and generals, have intensified their efforts to dominate the world. They have openly invaded other people's land and massacred the people. They attacked our neighbor, the Korean people, thereby threatening the fruits of victory of the Korean and Chinese peoples. This is something we cannot ignore. Therefore, today our Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops are fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army. They are the vanguard of the final anti-imperialist struggle. For this reason, I would like to dedicate this book to all peace-loving and peace-building people's heroes in the world.

    “为新中国奋斗”序言
    宋庆龄
    中国革命是一个长期的、艰苦的和复杂的斗争，为了这个斗争而牺牲的是很多很多。它错综在全体人民的生活之内，交织在祖国的大地上。
    中国革命的胜利是历史上最重大的事件之一，与伟大的十月社会主义革命具有同等的重要性。在争取民族独立和世界安全的斗争中，它们曾共同创造了许多宝贵的经验。它们也共同规划了未来的世界，到那时候人剥削人的思想将成为历史的记载，而原子弹也将与棒槌和土炮同样地变成博物馆的陈列品。
    从很多方面来说，中国革命是有它的独特性的。因此，关于它的事迹写得越多，从它的经验中所能获得的好处也越多。陈毅将军和另外几位朋友都劝我说，如果我能把我从一九二七年以来所发表的演讲、文章和声明编印出来，我可以在这方面有所贡献。因为他们认为这些著作反映了历年以来的革命潮流，反映了人民力量的消长，反映了人民的力量最后冲破一切，取得胜利。本集所收集的就是我在参加中国解放斗争中所讲所写的一部分。
    在这里收集的只是一部分，因为把全部汇编起来是不可能的。有些稿子在一九四一年十二月日寇进犯九龙香港的时候，在我从九龙避难重庆的途中遗失了。因此，临到要为这本文集搜集资料的时候，除了上海解放后所发表的几篇文章外，我所能选用的基本资料为数很少。我对于所遗失的材料虽已进行了搜寻工作，但是所得也不多。因此，这本书只能包括一部分写作。
    读者们可以看出，从一九二七年七月到一九四九年五月这段时期，我所发表的文字许多是以外国读者为对象的。其中有一部分是访问苏联时发表的：一方面对于苏联人民给予中国革命群众的鼓舞和帮助表示感激，另一方面也表示了坚持斗争直到全部胜利为止的决心。其余的部分主要是我在中国通过英文报纸和其他国内外可资利用的媒介写给英美人民的。当然，使这两大人民了解中国的形势，并且了解这里的斗争如何影响着他们自己争取安全和幸福的斗争，始终是而且在今天也还是非常重要的。至于我当时为什么身在自己的国家，却使用上述的方式，那是另有一个重要的原因的。由于我站在中国人民一方面，因此我向广大群众说话的一切途径都被封闭起来了。出版和广播都完全操纵在反动派的手里。他们不是压制我的言论就是歪曲和曲解我的意思。
    虽然有些中文出版物有时也能利用，而在必要的时候或环境许可的时候，我也利用它们；但是当我的意见必须传播得越广越好的时候，我就只好依仗外国报刊和其他外国媒介了。我这种办法有时使得当时被控制的出版界不得不登载我的声明。而这种公开的传播方式有时也使得人民能够通过自己的途径而听到。
    这里，我要说明一下，外国刊物和通讯社刊登我的声明这一事实，并不表示它们完全同情中国革命，或者能够让我畅所欲言。固然，有些外国报刊的确是本着真正国际主义的精神把我们之间的合作当作共同斗争中的一部分。但是，大多数的外国报刊却都是帝国主义的代言人，因此它们有时拒绝刊载我的文字，有时即使刊载了，也只是为了他们自己的目的，或是为了要有“耸动性”，或是为了“捷足先得的消息”。
    此外我可以表达自己的仅有的媒介（尤其是在三十年代的中期），便是通过中国人民的国际友人在中国所办的英文刊物。这些友人冒了和中国同志一样的革命危险。我对于他们在这段最困苦危险时期中的贡献，是永远衷心感激的。
    今天，人民取得了政权，形势完全改变了。凡是站在革命立场上愿意和人民发出一致呼声的人，都可以采用最普及的工具，用我们自己的语言和其他各种语言来发表意见。今天，真理可以毫不受限制地达到群众的耳目。我是抱着这种思想来准备这个文集的，同时我希望它能够对于研究这一时期中国人民斗争的人有所帮助。
    就在我整理这些文稿的时候，斗争又进入了一个新的阶段。那些以美国的银行家——将军们为首的帝国主义侵略者，更加紧了独霸全世界的图谋。他们已经公然侵略别人的土地，大肆屠杀人民。他们进攻了我们的邻人朝鲜人民，从而威胁了朝中两国人民的胜利果实。这是我们不能置之不理的。因此，今天我们的中国人民志愿军部队正与朝鲜人民军并肩作战。他们是最后一次反帝国主义的斗争的先锋队。为了这个缘故，我谨以此书献给全世界一切爱好和平与和平建设的人民英雄。
