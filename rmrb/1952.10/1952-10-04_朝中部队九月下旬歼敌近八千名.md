Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 2nd: In the few days after September 20th, fierce fighting took place on the eastern front of Korea. On the night of the 21st, a powerful night raid team from one of our units suddenly appeared before an important enemy mountain ridge position 3 kilometers east of Changchengli, catching the enemy off guard and unable to mount organized resistance. In the 35-minute battle, most of an enemy puppet army battalion was annihilated. While capturing this hilltop, another unit of our army, taking advantage of the enemy's confusion, bravely inserted itself deep into the enemy's position, destroying the enemy's battalion command post, killing and wounding more than 20 enemy personnel, including the battalion commander. At dawn on the 22nd, the enemy began a frantic counterattack on this hilltop, launching as many as 15 assaults, using forces ranging from one company to one regiment, deploying 73 aircraft sorties, and sending seven or eight tanks to assist in each assault. However, each enemy assault was repulsed by our army's valiant resistance and the fierce bombardment of our artillery fire. By dusk, our army had achieved the goal of annihilating a large number of enemy troops and withdrew from the hilltop in an orderly manner. On the 21st and 23rd, our army successively captured three high ground positions occupied by the enemy southwest of Changchengli and south of Gucheng, annihilating parts of the enemy forces. In the battles in the above four locations, our army annihilated a total of more than 2,110 enemy troops, captured six tanks, five artillery pieces of various types, eight light and heavy machine guns, 115 guns of various types, and 16 radio stations, and shot down three enemy aircraft.

On the western front, the battle for the hilltops in the Gaoyang Daixishan area northwest of Lianchuan continues. After our army captured a high ground on the 18th, the enemy launched a series of counterattacks, attempting to retake this high ground. In the 26 hours from 10:00 p.m. on the 20th to 12:00 p.m. on the 21st, the enemy launched nine consecutive counterattacks with forces ranging from two squads to two platoons; at dawn on the 23rd, the enemy increased its forces to one battalion and launched six counterattacks with the cooperation of twelve tanks, all of which were repulsed by our army. More than 520 enemy troops were killed or wounded, and five tanks were destroyed and three were damaged.

According to incomplete statistics from September 21st to 25th, our artillery units, with their fierce artillery fire, killed or wounded a total of 1,076 enemy troops and destroyed or damaged eight enemy tanks each.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 3rd: In the last five days of September, the Korean-Chinese People's Army continued to conduct counterattack and blocking battles, constantly achieving new victories.

On the night of September 28th, our army launched an attack on an enemy battalion on Hill 572 northeast of Yuyunli on the east bank of the Bukhan River, capturing three hilltops in the central part of the position in just 19 minutes; and after repelling thirteen enemy counterattacks under the cover of night-flying aircraft and artillery, it took advantage of the victory to counterattack, capturing the main peak of the hill and another hilltop within half an hour, completely annihilating two enemy companies and most of one company. Another unit of our army simultaneously captured "Square Hill," about 3 kilometers away from Hill 572, completely annihilating two enemy platoons guarding it. On the morning of the 29th, the enemy gathered about two battalions of troops to counterattack "Square Hill." On the morning of the 30th, the enemy even launched counterattacks on the above two high grounds with two battalions of troops. During this counterattack, the enemy also deployed 43 aircraft sorties to cooperate in the operation. However, they were all crushed by our army's fierce artillery fire. In these three days, our army annihilated more than 1,900 enemy troops.

In the Gimseong southeastern area, on the night of the 28th, our army, with the cooperation of powerful artillery fire, launched an attack on the enemy occupying two hilltops east of Mount Gyoyam. On one of the hilltops, it closely coordinated with the troops who had been fighting in the tunnels for many days, attacking the enemy from both sides and quickly capturing the position. Afterwards, it repelled 15 enemy counterattacks, annihilated four platoons of the puppet Gyeonggi Division, and killed or wounded more than 360 enemy troops. On the night of the 29th, our infantry, with the cooperation of tanks and artillery, captured a hilltop west of Gwandae-ri in Gimseong southeastern area in one fell swoop, completely annihilating one enemy company and another five platoons guarding it. On the night of the 29th and during the day of the 30th, the enemy desperately counterattacked, breaking into our position three times, but were all repulsed by our army. In this day and night of fierce fighting, another 600 enemy troops were annihilated.
