The strength of our Soviet Motherland is continually growing as a result of the correct policy of the Communist Party and its organizational work in implementing this policy. As the guiding and leading force of Soviet society, the Party ensures that the state is prepared to actively defend itself, that the efforts of the people are directed towards defeating the enemy in wartime, and towards raising the national economy to new heights in the postwar period.

The historic victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War, the ahead-of-schedule completion of the fourth five-year plan, the further development of the national economy, the improvement of the material well-being and cultural level of the Soviet people, the strengthening of spiritual and political unity in Soviet society, the strengthening of friendship among the peoples of our country, and the unity of all forces of the peace and democracy camp around the Soviet Union—all these confirm the correctness of our Party's policy. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

The period discussed in the report is one of further strengthening of the Party, of the consolidation of complete unity and solidarity in its ranks. The unity that our Party has achieved in its struggle against the enemies of Leninism is the most characteristic feature of the situation within the Party and of Party life. This is the source of our Party's strength and invincibility. (Prolonged applause)

The unity of the Party's ranks was a decisive condition for the victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War. In the most critical days of the war, when the fate of our Motherland was at stake, our Party acted as a unified fighting organization, with no wavering or differing opinions within its own ranks. The results of the war show the full significance of the uncompromising struggle that our Party has waged for many years against all kinds of enemies of Marxism-Leninism, against the Trotskyite-Bukharinite renegades, against the traitors and surrenderers who sought to lead the Party away from the correct path and to disrupt the unity of its ranks. It has been proven that these vile traitors and turncoats hoped for a military attack on the Soviet Union and counted on striking the Soviet state from behind in the most difficult times, in order to curry favor with the enemies of our people. By liquidating the core of anti-Soviet forces within the Soviet Union, the hidden underground Trotskyite-Bukharinite elements, and by purging the enemies of the people from the Party and Soviet organizations, the Party was able to timely eliminate any possibility of the appearance of a "fifth column" in the Soviet Union and to prepare the Soviet Union politically for active defense. It is not difficult to understand that if we had not done this work in time, we would have found ourselves in a situation of being attacked from both sides during the war and could have suffered defeat.

The unshakable unity of the Party's ranks is primarily due to our leader and teacher—Comrade Stalin, who has consistently upheld the Leninist unity of the Party. (The entire hall stands. Stormy, prolonged applause, which then turns into cheering.) The unity of the Party's ranks, in the past, present, and future, will always be the foundation of the Party's strength and invincibility. The Party, tempered in the crucible of the war's severe trials and in the struggle to overcome postwar difficulties, is more united than ever around the Central Committee at this Congress. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

The strength of our Party lies in its flesh-and-blood ties with the masses, in the fact that it is a truly people's party, and its policy corresponds to the vital interests of the people. The role of the Soviet trade unions and the Communist Youth League in uniting the working people around the Party and in educating the people in the spirit of communism has greatly increased. In the struggle to defend the freedom and independence of our Motherland and to build a communist society, the Party and the people have become even closer, and the ties between the Party and the broad masses of the working people have been strengthened. The Soviet people unanimously support the Party's policy and have complete trust in it. (Stormy applause)

The development of the Party's ranks is evidence of the strengthening of the ties between the Party and the masses and of the consolidation of the Party's prestige among the Soviet people. At the 18th Congress, the Party had 1,588,852 full members and 888,814 candidate members, a total of 2,477,666. As of October 1, 1952, the Party had 6,882,145 members, of whom 6,013,259 were full members and 868,886 were candidate members. (Applause)

During the Great Patriotic War, despite the enormous losses suffered by the Party at the front, the number of Party members not only did not decrease but increased by more than 160,000. The Party was joined by the most steadfast warriors from the Soviet Army and Navy who fought bravely at the front, by the advanced representatives of the working class, collective farmers, and Soviet intelligentsia who selflessly strove to ensure victory over the enemy in the rear.

After the war, the Central Committee decided to slow down the admission of new Party members somewhat, but even so, the admission of new members continued to accelerate. The Party could not fail to notice that the rapid growth of the Party's ranks also had certain drawbacks, since this could to some extent lower the political consciousness of the Party's ranks and the quality of the Party members. There was a certain degree of disproportion between the numerical growth of the Party's ranks and the political education level of the Party members and candidate members. To eliminate this disproportion and to further improve the quality of the Party members, the Central Committee considered it necessary to stop the accelerated growth of the Party's ranks and to focus the attention of the Party organizations on raising the political level of the Party members and candidate members. According to the instructions of the Central Committee, Party organizations began to select new members more carefully, to raise the requirements for admission, and to widely develop the work of raising the political education of the Communist Party members. As a result, the political level of the Party's ranks and the Marxist-Leninist consciousness of our cadres have undoubtedly improved. However, we cannot say that we have completed the task of eliminating the phenomenon of the political education of the Communist Party members lagging behind the development of the Party's ranks. Since this is the case, we must continue to follow the line of restricting admission to the Party and improving the political education and Party tempering of the members, because the strength of the Party lies not so much in the number of its members as in their quality.

Strengthening the Party's apparatus, improving its work, and strengthening the work of the Party organizations have special importance in the postwar period.

The end of the war and the transition to peaceful construction have presented the state with new tasks, which require a serious improvement in Party work and an increase in the leadership level of the Party organizations in the state and economic activities. The problem is that the wartime environment forced the Party to adopt certain special leadership methods, which led to serious shortcomings in the work of the Party apparatus and organizations. This shortcoming is primarily evident in the fact that the Party apparatus paid less attention to the work of the Party organizations and ideological work, so that in many Party organizations this work was neglected. There was a certain danger of the Party apparatus becoming detached from the masses, of the political leadership organs becoming administrative dispatching organs, incapable of opposing various local, departmental, and other tendencies harmful to the interests of the state, and of not noticing the open distortion of the Party's economic construction policy and the harm to the interests of the state.

To stop this danger and to successfully solve the tasks of strengthening the local Party apparatus and improving the work of the Party organizations, it is necessary to eliminate the neglect of Party organizational and ideological work and to stop such actions as the administrative leadership methods within the Party organizations, since these actions lead to bureaucratism in the Party's work and weaken the activity and initiative of the Party members and masses.

The Central Committee has made it the central task of all Party organizations to thoroughly implement Party democracy and to develop criticism and self-criticism, and on this basis to strengthen the supervision of the Party members and masses over the activities of the Party apparatus, because this is the key to improving the entire work of the Party, to increasing the activity and initiative of the Party organizations and members. The measures taken by the Party to develop Party democracy and self-criticism have helped the Party organizations to a considerable extent to overcome the shortcomings in Party political work and have played a major role in improving this work. On this basis, the activity and initiative of the Party members have been increased, the primary Party organizations in enterprises, collective farms, and institutions have been strengthened, their work has been invigorated, the supervision of the Party members and masses over the work of the Party apparatus has been strengthened, and the role of the plenary meetings of the Party committees and the meetings of Party activists has been increased.

However, if we do not see that the level of Party political work is still lagging behind the needs of life and behind the tasks set by the Party, then that is a mistake. It must be admitted that there are shortcomings and errors in the work of the Party organizations; in our Party organizations' life there are still many bad and often unhealthy phenomena, which must be known, seen, and exposed in order to eliminate and overcome them and to ensure further smooth progress.

What are these shortcomings, errors, bad, and unhealthy phenomena? What, therefore, is the task of the Party?

(1) Self-criticism, especially criticism from below, as the main method of exposing and overcoming our errors, shortcomings, weaknesses, and faults, has far from been sufficiently developed, and even less so in all Party organizations.

In Party organizations, there is still insufficient understanding of the role of criticism and self-criticism in the life of the Party and the state, and there are phenomena of persecution and reprisals against criticism. We often encounter officials who, while verbosely expressing their loyalty to the Party, cannot accept criticism from below, suppress criticism, and take revenge on the critics. We know of many cases where criticism and self-criticism have been treated in a bureaucratic manner, which has caused great harm to the Party's cause, killed the initiative of the Party organizations, undermined the authority of the leadership organs in the eyes of the Party members and masses, and even produced the anti-Party spirit of the Party's enemies—the bureaucrats—in some Party organizations.

The Party cannot ignore the fact that wherever criticism and self-criticism are suppressed, wherever the supervision of the masses over the activities of the organizations and institutions is relaxed, bureaucratism, corruption, and even the disintegration of individual links in our apparatus are bound to arise. Naturally, these phenomena are not universal. Now our Party is stronger and healthier than ever. However, we must understand that these dangerous and unhealthy phenomena have not become universal because the Party has used the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, has timely, openly, and courageously exposed these phenomena, and has resolutely struck at the concrete manifestations of arrogance, bureaucratism, and corruption. The wisdom of the leadership lies in its ability to see danger in the bud and prevent it from developing into a threat.

Criticism and self-criticism are the tried and tested weapons that the Party uses to fight against the shortcomings, errors, and pathological phenomena that harm the healthy body of the Party. Criticism and self-criticism do not weaken the Soviet state and the Soviet social system but strengthen them, and this is a characteristic of the strength and vitality of the Soviet social system.

It is especially important now: to develop self-criticism and criticism from below, to regard those who obstruct the criticism of our shortcomings, suppress criticism, and allow critics to be persecuted and punished as enemies of the Party, and to wage an uncompromising struggle against them. The fact is that, as a result of the victorious end of the war and the great economic achievements of the postwar period, a sense of complacency, ease, and smug self-satisfaction has developed in the Party's ranks. It has been shown that victory has produced a sense of complacency, ease, and smug self-satisfaction in the Party's ranks, a desire to rest on one's laurels and live off past merits. There are many officials who think that "we can do anything," "we don't care about anything," "everything is going well," and who do not want to bother with unpleasant work such as exposing shortcomings and errors in the work or fighting against the bad and unhealthy phenomena in our organizations. This harmful mood already exists in some of our cadres who lack proper education and Party spirit. The leaders of the Party, Soviet, and economic organizations often turn meetings, meetings of activists, plenary meetings, and representative meetings into formalities, into occasions for self-praise, as a result of which errors and shortcomings in the work, faults, and weaknesses are not exposed and do not receive criticism, which aggravates the sense of complacency and self-satisfaction. The idea of peace has penetrated the Party organizations. The personnel of the Party, Soviet, economic organizations, and other organizations have become complacent, relaxed their vigilance, and leaked Party and state secrets. Some officials, dazzled by their achievements, have forgotten that the capitalist encirclement still exists, that the enemies of the Soviet state are constantly trying to infiltrate their spies into our country, and are using the unstable elements in Soviet society to serve their vile purposes.

To advance our cause victoriously, we must resolutely fight against all bad phenomena, focus the attention of the Party and all Soviet people on eliminating the shortcomings in our work, and for this purpose, we must widely develop self-criticism, especially criticism from below.

The active participation of the broad masses of working people in the struggle against the shortcomings in our work and the bad phenomena in our social life vividly proves that the Soviet system is truly democratic and that the Soviet people are highly politically conscious. Criticism from below is a manifestation of the spontaneous creativity and initiative of millions of working people, a manifestation of their concern for the strengthening of the Soviet state. The more widely we develop self-criticism and criticism from below, the more fully we can tap the creative power and energy of our people, and the more the sense of ownership of the state by the masses will develop and strengthen.

The idea that criticism from below can develop spontaneously is wrong. Only when every person who makes a healthy criticism can be sure that he will receive the support of our organization, and only when the shortcomings he points out will be truly eliminated, can criticism from below develop, grow, and expand. It is necessary for the Party organizations and Party workers, and all our leaders, to lead this movement and set an example of a sincere and conscious attitude towards criticism. Every leader, especially a Party worker, has the responsibility to create conditions under which all honest Soviet people can boldly and fearlessly criticize the shortcomings in the work of our organizations and institutions. The meetings, meetings of activists, plenary meetings, and representative meetings held by organizations at all levels must truly become broad platforms for bold and sharp criticism of shortcomings.

The persistent struggle against the shortcomings and faults in the work of the Party, Soviet, economic organizations, and other organizations must be made a daily task of the entire Party. A Communist Party member has no right to ignore unhealthy phenomena and shortcomings in the work, and even less to hide these things from the Party. If a Party member finds that the work of an organization is not going well, if he finds that the interests of the Party and the state are being harmed, he has the responsibility to report the shortcomings to the Party leadership organs, up to the Central Committee of the Party, without hesitation. This is the responsibility of every Communist Party member, and it is his most important duty to the Party. Some leaders think that if their subordinates report shortcomings to the Central Committee of the Party, their subordinates are hindering them in their leadership work and undermining their authority. We must resolutely eliminate this harmful and extremely anti-Party view.

The task of the Party is to fully develop criticism and self-criticism and to eliminate everything that obstructs and hinders criticism. The more people are involved in eliminating the shortcomings in our work, the stronger the supervision from below over the activities of all our organizations will be, and the more smoothly our work will progress in all fields. To consistently implement the slogan of criticism and self-criticism, it is necessary to wage a resolute struggle against all those who obstruct the development of criticism and persecute and take revenge on critics. Officials who cannot develop criticism and self-criticism are obstacles to our progress. They have not yet matured enough to be leaders, and they cannot expect the trust of the Party.

(2) Party and state discipline is still very lax in some Party, Soviet, economic organizations, and other organizations.

Among our cadres, there are many officials who take a formal attitude towards the decisions of the Party and the government, do not strive to implement them with initiative and persistence, and work in a way that is not satisfactory, harming the interests of the state, and are indifferent to this phenomenon. Taking a formal attitude towards the decisions of the Party and the government, taking a passive attitude towards their implementation, are vices that must be ruthlessly eradicated. The Party needs not officials who do routine work and formalities, who put personal comfort above work, but fighters who put the interests of the state above everything else and selflessly carry out the instructions of the Party and the government.

A most dangerous and harmful violation of Party discipline and state law is when some officials conceal the true state of affairs in the enterprises and institutions under their jurisdiction and exaggerate their achievements. The Central Committee and the government have exposed cases of officials who put the narrow interests of their departments and localities above the interests of the state, using the pretext of caring for the enterprises under their jurisdiction to conceal the materials at their disposal from the government, and thus going the way of violating Party discipline and state law. In addition, it is known that some officials in the economic field, with the connivance of the Party organizations, have submitted lists of raw materials and materials far exceeding the needs, and some have fabricated excuses in production reports to justify their failure to fulfill the production plan.

There are also a few officials who, forgetting that the enterprises entrusted to them are state enterprises, try to turn these enterprises into their personal property. Such a leader—if he can still be called that—thinks he can do anything he wants. (Laughter) Another serious vice is that many of our officials seem to think that the decisions of the Party and the laws of the Soviets do not apply to them, imagining that there are two kinds of discipline: one for ordinary people and one for leaders. These "leaders" think that they can do anything, that they can completely disregard the laws and regulations established by the state and the Party, that they can violate Soviet laws, and that they can take various arbitrary actions.

The Party demands that all Party members, especially leading cadres, be loyal and honest, and that they fulfill their responsibilities to the Party and the state. The Party cannot trust those who harm the interests of the state in their actions, who try to play tricks on the government, and who deceive the Party and the state. Any deception of the Party and the state, regardless of the form it takes; any attempt at deception; whether it is concealing the truth or distorting the truth, can only be considered a very serious crime against the Party. Now everyone should understand that our Party has only one discipline, which binds both ordinary members and leaders; Soviet laws apply equally to all Soviet people, regardless of their position. For leaders, if they take an untruthful attitude towards the implementation of the decisions of the Party and the government or have illegal and arbitrary actions, their punishment cannot be reduced because of their position.

The current task is: to resolutely eliminate all violations of Party and state discipline; to remove irresponsibility, slackness, and a formal attitude towards the decisions of the Party and the government; to constantly raise the sense of responsibility of all our officials to the Party and the state; to ruthlessly eradicate disloyalty and dishonesty. Any official who conceals the truth from the Party and has the intention to deceive the Party is not allowed to remain in the Party's ranks. It is the most important responsibility of every Party and government official to consistently uphold the interests of our state, to persistently struggle for the implementation of the decisions of the Party and the government.

(3) The great Lenin instructed that the main point in organizational work is the correct selection of personnel and the checking of the implementation, and this instruction has not been fully carried out.

The facts show that the correct selection of personnel and the checking of the implementation have far from become the main point in the leadership work of the central and local Party, Soviet, and economic organizations.

The fact that the central instructions and decisions are not properly implemented and that there is no proper supervision of their implementation is one of the most common and deeply rooted shortcomings in the actual work of the Soviet, economic, and Party organizations. Our organizations and institutions issue far more decisions, instructions, and orders than are needed, but they rarely care whether these decisions are implemented and how they are implemented. The essence of the matter is that these decisions should be correctly implemented, not bureaucratically. Taking an untruthful and irresponsible attitude towards the implementation of the instructions of the leadership organs is the most dangerous and vile manifestation of bureaucratism. Experience shows that even excellent workers, if left unsupervised and unchecked, and if their work is not checked, can become bad and bureaucratized.

In the entire leadership system, in the work of all organizations and institutions, from top to bottom, it is necessary to strengthen supervision and checking of the implementation of decisions as much as possible. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to raise the personal sense of responsibility of all organizational and institutional leaders for checking the implementation of the decisions of the Party and the government, to seriously improve the work of the central and local inspection and control organs, to strengthen their personnel, so that this work can be entrusted to authoritative, experienced, politically sensitive people who can strictly protect the interests of the state. It is necessary to greatly strengthen the supervisory role of the Party, to focus the attention of the Party organizations on checking the implementation of the decisions of the Party and the government. In all work related to checking the implementation of decisions, our leadership organs must rely on the broad masses of working people, rely on the Party, trade union, and Komsomol organizations, and rely on the activists of the local Soviets. Only when the checking of the implementation from top to bottom is combined with the checking of the Party and non-Party masses from below can we ensure the timely elimination of the shortcomings in the work of our organizations and institutions, and can we create the conditions for the timely, accurate, and Bolshevik implementation of decisions and instructions.

Cadres are the decisive force in the leadership work of the Party and the state, and if cadres are not properly selected and trained, it is impossible to successfully implement the Party's political line. The main task in the selection of cadres is to strive to improve the quality of the personnel, to strengthen our Party, state, and economic organizations with personnel who are loyal to the interests of the Party and the state, who are proficient in their business, and who can advance their business.

As a result of these steps taken by the Party, the composition of the leading cadres has greatly improved. However, this does not mean that the problem of improving the quality of the leading cadres has been completely solved. Now all economic sectors have adopted the most advanced technical equipment, and the cultural level of the Soviet people has been raised to an unprecedented level, so the requirements for leading cadres have changed, and the requirements for them are higher. In industry and agriculture, as well as in the Party and state institutions, all those who hold leadership positions must be cultured people, experts in their field, who can infuse new strength, support everything advanced and progressive, and who can creatively develop it. We have all the possibilities to achieve this, because now the reserve of leading cadres who meet these requirements is much broader than before.

Today, to further strengthen the composition of the leading cadres, it is mainly necessary to correctly organize the work of examining and selecting personnel, and therefore, first of all, to eliminate the shortcomings, errors, and deviations in the work of cadres. And we have many shortcomings in this regard.

The main shortcoming is that some leaders, when selecting cadres, do not base themselves on their political qualities and professional abilities, but on kinship, friendship, and native-place relationships. Often, honest and competent workers are pushed out on various pretexts because they do not tolerate shortcomings, which makes the leadership uncomfortable, and in their place are put people of doubtful quality or completely unfit, but considered pliable and pleasant by some leaders. This behavior, which violates the Party's policy of selecting and promoting cadres, has formed a kind of family in some organizations, composed of their own people, who protect each other and put the interests of their group above the interests of the Party and the state. Naturally, such a situation often leads to degeneration and corruption. The Party organization of Ulyanovsk is an example, where part of the economic workers and Soviet and Party workers in the leadership of this regional organization have degenerated and become corrupt, to the point of embezzling public funds and stealing state property.

Taking a bureaucratic and formalistic attitude towards the examination and selection of personnel is very harmful to the work of improving the composition of the leadership organs. The selection of personnel is often based on resumes and documents, without a serious examination of their professional abilities and political qualities. The bad practice of approving or appointing personnel without seeing them in person has become deeply rooted in the work of selecting cadres. It is obvious that taking such a formalistic and bureaucratic attitude towards the selection of cadres makes it impossible to correctly determine whether the selected personnel are suitable for the work they are assigned. Without knowing the strengths and weaknesses of a worker, it is impossible to determine which position can best utilize his personal abilities.

The Party organizations are responsible for ensuring that the principles of selecting and distributing cadres, as determined by our Party, are strictly observed in every link of our institutions. It is necessary to wage an uncompromising struggle against kinship and mutual protection, to eliminate the bureaucratic attitude towards the examination and selection of cadres. It is necessary to raise the work of examining and selecting cadres in the Party organs to a higher level, and to greatly strengthen the supervision of the Party over this work in the Soviet organizations and economic institutions.

The current task is to make the selection of personnel and the checking of the implementation of decisions truly the main point in the leadership work of the central and local Party, Soviet, and economic organizations. It should be remembered that the purpose of checking the implementation is mainly to expose shortcomings, to expose illegal actions, to help honest workers, to give them advice, to punish those who cannot correct their mistakes, and to ensure the implementation of the decisions that have been adopted, to study experience, and on the basis of this experience to ensure that the tasks set are solved in a more correct, advantageous, and economical way. We cannot tolerate a bureaucratic attitude towards the issue of checking the implementation of decisions; we cannot be afraid to revoke or correct a decision that has been adopted if it is found to be incorrect or inaccurate. The work of checking the implementation of decisions is inseparably linked with the task of overcoming the shortcomings in the selection of cadres; it is necessary to dismiss bad, unfit, backward, and dishonest workers on the basis of the results of the checking, and to replace them with excellent, fit, advanced, and honest people; the work of checking the implementation of decisions should help to promote new people who can advance the work and uphold the interests of the state.

(4) Many Party organizations underestimate the importance of ideological work, and therefore this work lags behind the tasks of the Party, and in some organizations, this work is in a state of neglect.

Ideological work is the primary responsibility of the Party, and neglecting this work can cause irreparable damage to the interests of the Party and the state. We must always remember that any weakening of the influence of socialist ideology means an increase in the influence of bourgeois ideology.

In our Soviet society, there is no and cannot be a class basis for the dominance of bourgeois ideology. In our country, socialist ideology dominates, and its unshakable foundation is Marxism-Leninism. However, in our country, there are still remnants of bourgeois ideology, private property concepts, and morals. These remnants will not disappear on their own; they are very stubborn and can grow, so they must be resolutely fought. We cannot guarantee that we will not be influenced by views, ideas, and moods that are contrary to ours, which come either from abroad, from capitalist countries, or from within the country, from the remnants of groups that are hostile to the Soviet power but have not yet been completely eradicated by our Party. We must never forget that the enemies of the Soviet state are trying to spread, create, and incite various unhealthy moods, to corrupt our society's unstable elements ideologically.

Title: Certain Party Organizations Neglect Ideological Work

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th

	Some of our party organizations are so preoccupied with economic affairs that they have neglected ideological work, setting it aside. Even advanced party organizations like the Moscow Party Organization have not paid sufficient attention to ideological work. This cannot but have adverse effects. Where ideological work is neglected, it creates fertile ground for the revival of hostile viewpoints and ideas. Various anti-party elements and remnants of anti-Leninist groups that have been smashed by the party seize upon the ideological departments that the party organizations have neglected for some reason or another, where the party's leadership and influence have been weakened. They use these departments to propagate their lines, revive, and spread various non-Marxist "viewpoints" and "ideas."

	The underestimation of ideological work to a large extent is the result of some of our leading cadres failing to raise their political and ideological standards, enrich their knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, and learn from the party's historical experience. Without this, one cannot become a truly mature leader. If a person is ideologically and politically backward, lives by rote formulas, and loses the ability to sense new things, he cannot correctly analyze the domestic and international situation, cannot and does not deserve to stand at the forefront of the movement, and will eventually be discarded by reality. Only by constantly striving to improve one's ideological and political standards, creatively mastering Marxism-Leninism, and cultivating and perfecting one's qualities as a Leninist and Stalinist worker, can one be up to the tasks of our party.

	The party organizations have done poorly in raising the ideological and political standards of party members and candidate members. They have not effectively organized and supervised the study of Marxism-Leninism by party members and candidate members. Therefore, many Communist Party members still lack the necessary knowledge of Marxism-Leninism. Raising the political knowledge of party members and candidate members is a necessary condition for strengthening their advanced role in all aspects of life, enhancing the initiative of the party masses, and improving the work of party organizations.

	Due to inadequate leadership of ideological work and lack of supervision over its content, serious errors and deviations are often found in books, newspapers, magazines, and the work of scientific institutions and other ideological work departments. Thanks to the attention of the Party Central Committee, many scientific departments have exposed habits and traditions incompatible with the Soviet people, revealed the closing of the door to criticism and the refusal to allow criticism, exposed and smashed various manifestations of bourgeois ideology and various vulgar distortions. The well-known discussions on philosophy, biology, physiology, linguistics, and political economy have exposed serious ideological shortcomings in various scientific departments; promoted the development of criticism and debate, and played an important role in the development of science. The rule of cliques in many scientific departments has been smashed. However, in some scientific departments, the monopolistic phenomenon of individual scientist groups has not been completely eliminated. They exclude emerging new forces, do not accept criticism, and attempt to solve scientific problems by administrative means. In an atmosphere of mutual flattery and covering up errors, no scientific department can develop smoothly; if scientists attempt to establish monopolies of small groups, it will inevitably lead to stagnation and even corruption in science.

	The party's ideological work should play an important role in freeing people's minds from the remnants of capitalism, old societal prejudices, and harmful traditions. In the future, we must cultivate a high sense of social responsibility among the masses, educate the working people with Soviet patriotism and the spirit of friendship among all peoples, with a spirit of concern for the interests of the state, and develop the finest qualities of Soviet people—confidence in the victory of our cause, and the determination and ability to overcome any difficulties.

	The task of party organizations is to resolutely eliminate the harmful tendency to underestimate the importance of ideological work and to strengthen ideological work at all levels of the party and the state. We must relentlessly expose all manifestations of thought that run counter to Marxism. We must develop and perfect socialist culture, science, literature, and art, and mobilize all means of ideological and political education, our propaganda, agitation work, and press to improve the ideological standards of Communist Party members, and enhance the political vigilance and political awareness of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. All workers of our party, without exception, must strive to raise their ideological level and master the rich political experience of the party, so as not to lag behind reality and to be up to the tasks of the party. Party organizations must constantly work to raise the ideological level of party members and candidate members, teach them to study Marxism-Leninism, and cultivate them into politically conscious and self-aware Communist Party members.

	In further consolidating the party, our tasks are as follows:

	1. Continue to improve the quality of the party, not allowing the pursuit of quantity, but concentrating on raising the political level and Marxist-Leninist standards of party members and candidate members; enhance the political activism of Communist Party members, making all party members into steadfast fighters for the implementation of the party's policies and resolutions, who are uncompromising towards shortcomings in work and work tirelessly to eliminate them; improve the work of trade unions and the Communist Youth League and make it perfect, always strengthen the connection with the masses, and firmly remember that the party's strength and invincibility lie in its unbreakable bond with the people;

	2. Eliminate the extremely harmful and dangerous self-satisfaction and complacency towards our cause, eliminate boastfulness and indifference to everything in the party ranks, boldly and resolutely expose and eliminate shortcomings and weaknesses in our work; thoroughly promote party democracy, expand criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up, ensure that all honest Soviet people can boldly and fearlessly criticize the shortcomings in the work of our organizations and institutions, and wage an uncompromising struggle against all attempts to suppress criticism and retaliate against critics, strengthen party discipline and state law in all ways, eliminate the attitude of indifference towards the decisions of the party and the government, and wage a resolute struggle against indiscipline and actions harmful to the interests of the state;

	3. Raise the work of party organs in the correct selection, allocation, and training of cadres to a higher level, strictly adhere to the principles of correct cadre selection as stipulated by the party, wage an uncompromising struggle against those who violate these principles, ruthlessly strike down bureaucratic attitudes in cadre selection, improve the quality of leading cadres, more boldly promote those who are loyal to the interests of the party and the state, are familiar with their work, and can further improve their work to leadership positions, remove bad, unsuitable, backward, and disloyal workers; strengthen supervision and inspection of the implementation of decisions from top to bottom in the entire leadership system, enhance the personal sense of responsibility of all organizational and institutional leaders for inspecting the implementation of the decisions of the party and the government, combine this top-down inspection with the bottom-up inspection carried out by party members and non-party members; ensure that the correct selection of cadres and the inspection of the implementation of decisions truly become the main points of the leadership work of central and local party organizations, Soviets, and economic organizations;

	4. Eliminate the phenomenon of neglecting ideological work, and wage a resolute struggle against the liberal and indifferent attitude towards ideological errors and deviations, gradually raise and improve the ideological and political standards of our cadres; mobilize all means of ideological education, our propaganda, agitation, and press to carry out communist education among the Soviet people; raise Soviet science to a higher level, promote criticism and debate in scientific work, and remember that only in this way can Soviet science fulfill its mission of occupying a leading position in world science;

	5. Continue to protect the Leninist unity of the party's ranks as if protecting the apple of one's eye, because this unity is the foundation of our party's strength and invincibility. (Stormy, sustained applause)

	Comrades!

	In our era, the great teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin illuminate the path of world civilization.

	Our party is strong because all its activities are guided by the theory of Marxism-Leninism. Our party's policy is based on scientific knowledge of the laws of social development.

	The historical role of our great teachers Lenin and Stalin is to deeply study the theoretical foundations of Marxism, fully master dialectics, defend and safeguard Marxism from any distortion, and brilliantly develop Marxist theory. At every new turning point in history, Lenin and Stalin linked Marxism with the specific tasks of the times, creatively expounded the teachings of Marx and Engels, proving that Marxism is not a dead doctrine but a living guide to action.

	The theory of Marxism-Leninism is the object of Stalin's tireless study. In the recent period, the center of Stalin's theoretical activities has been the interpretation of the problems of the development of the socialist economy and the gradual transition to communism. Stalin creatively enriched and developed Marxist-Leninist science, thereby arming the party and the Soviet people ideologically to win our cause.

	Stalin's latest work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" has great significance for Marxist-Leninist theory and for all our practical activities. (Stormy, sustained applause) This work provides a comprehensive study of the laws of the production and distribution of material wealth in a socialist society; it establishes the scientific principles of the development of the socialist economy, pointing out the path from socialism to communism. Stalin's interpretation of economic theory problems has greatly advanced Marxist-Leninist political economy.

	Stalin has put forward the basic principles for preparing the transition to communism. Stalin teaches us that to prepare for the actual transition to communism, at least three basic prerequisites must be achieved.

	"First, it must be reliably ensured that... the continuous growth of the entire social production, primarily the production of means of production. The primary growth of the production of means of production is necessary not only because it should equip its own enterprises and all other departments of the national economy, but also because without this growth, expanded reproduction is fundamentally impossible." (J. Stalin: "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR")

	"Second, it is necessary to gradually raise the collective farm ownership to the level of state ownership through methods that are beneficial to the collective farms and thus to the whole society, and also to gradually replace the commodity circulation system with a product exchange system, so that the central government or other socio-economic centers can control the entire production of the society to serve the interests of the society." (Ibid)

	Of course, at present, we are successfully using commodity circulation and collective farm ownership to develop the socialist economy, which is undoubtedly beneficial to our society. In the near future, they will still be beneficial. However, we must pay attention to our future development.

	Stalin points out: "... if we allow the economic facts of collective farm group ownership, commodity circulation, etc., to continue to operate, we will not be able to obtain a sufficient amount of products to meet all the needs of society, nor will we be able to transition to the formula of 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs'." (Ibid)

	As long as the socialist economy retains its two basic production sectors—the state sector and the collective farm sector—commodity circulation and its "monetary economy" will inevitably continue to operate—the necessary and useful factors in our national economic system. The existence of commodity production and commodity circulation also determines the existence of the law of value in the socialist system, although in our system it no longer plays the role of regulating production.

	However, commodity circulation, like the law of value, is not eternal. When the two basic forms of socialist production—the state form and the collective farm form—give way to a comprehensive production sector, commodity circulation and its "monetary economy" will disappear, just like the law of value. Some people think that commodity circulation will continue to exist under the communist system, which has nothing to do with Marxism. Commodity circulation is incompatible with the future of the transition from socialism to communism.

	Stalin, in his theoretical exposition, discussed the measures to raise collective farm ownership to the level of state ownership, the issue of gradually transitioning to the system of exchanging products between state industry and collective farms. The current form of product exchange, i.e., the "product supply" to collective farms growing cotton, flax, sugar beets, and other collective farms, will develop into a broad product exchange system.

	Stalin points out: "Such a system requires a large increase in the products sent from the city to the countryside, so it should be carried out consistently and without hesitation, step by step, to gradually narrow the scope of commodity circulation and expand the scope of product exchange.

	"Such a system narrows the scope of commodity circulation, making it easier for socialism to transition to communism. In addition, it will enable the basic property of collective farms to be included in the overall planned system of the state.

	"To raise the collective farm ownership to the level of state ownership under the current conditions in our country, this will be a practical and decisive measure." (Ibid)

	The product exchange system is undoubtedly beneficial to collective farmers, as they will obtain more and cheaper products from the state than under the commodity circulation system. Collective farms that are already enjoying "product supply"—the embryo of product exchange—are now personally experiencing the great advantages and benefits of this system. It is known that many such collective farms are the richest farms.

	Stalin points out: For the basic prerequisites for preparing the transition to communism, "third, it is necessary to achieve such a high level of social culture that ensures the all-round development of the physical and mental abilities of all members of society, enabling them to receive an education that makes them active participants in social development, and to freely choose their occupation without being bound to a particular occupation for life due to the existing social division of labor." (Ibid)

	"For this, first of all, it is necessary to shorten the working hours to at least six hours, and then to five hours. This is necessary to give society's members sufficient free time to receive a comprehensive education. Secondly, for this, it is necessary to implement compulsory technical education for all, which is necessary to enable society's members to freely choose their occupation without being bound to a particular occupation for life. Thirdly, for this, it is necessary to fundamentally improve living conditions and raise the actual minimum wage of workers and employees by at least two times, not only by directly increasing monetary wages, but especially by continuously lowering the prices of consumer goods." (Ibid)

	Stalin teaches us that only after achieving all these prerequisites can we hope that labor will no longer be a heavy burden in the eyes of society's members, as it is in capitalist society, but will become a vital necessity, and social ownership will be considered by all members of society as the unshakable and inviolable foundation of social existence. Only after all these prerequisites are fully achieved, it will be possible to transition from the socialist formula "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" to the communist formula "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."

	Stalin consistently warns us not to act rashly and transition to a higher economic form before the prerequisites for the transition are created.

	Stalin provides a scientific solution to the important social problem and programmatic communist problem of eliminating the opposition between city and countryside, and between physical and mental labor. He also elaborates on the problem of eliminating the essential differences between city and countryside, and between physical and mental labor in a socialist society—a new problem in Marxist science.

	Therefore, the party's plans for the future, which determine our destiny and the path we must follow in our advance, are formulated on the basis of the knowledge of economic laws and the scientific construction of a communist society as expounded by Stalin. (Stormy, sustained applause)

	Stalin's argument for the objectivity of economic laws has great principled significance. Stalin teaches us that the laws of economic development, the laws of political economy—whether we are studying capitalism or socialism—are objective laws that reflect the process of economic development. These objective laws proceed independently of human will. People can discover these laws, understand them, and use them to serve social interests, but they cannot eliminate old economic laws or create new ones. Economic laws are not created by human will but arise on the basis of new economic conditions.

	Some people think that economic development laws can be arbitrarily created or abolished, and that because of the special role assigned to the Soviet state by history, the Soviet state can abolish existing political economy laws, "formulate" new laws, or "transform" existing laws. These views are completely wrong. Denying the objective regularity of economic life in socialism will lead to chaos and unexpected events. This would make political economy cease to be a science, because if science does not recognize and study objective regularities, science cannot flourish and develop. Denying the objectivity of economic laws is the ideological basis of adventurism in economic policy and extreme arbitrariness in the practical guidance of the economy.

	Stalin's discoveries about the basic economic laws of modern capitalism and socialism are a great contribution to Marxist political economy. This basic economic law explains the essence, all major aspects, and the basic processes of development of a certain mode of production; this law provides the key to understanding and explaining all the laws of a certain economic system.

	Stalin proves that the main characteristics and requirements of the basic economic law of modern capitalism are: "to ensure the maximum capitalist profit by exploiting the majority of the population of one's own country and making them bankrupt and impoverished, by enslaving and continuously plundering the peoples of other countries, especially backward countries, and finally by waging wars and militarizing the national economy that can ensure the highest profits." (Ibid) This law exposes and explains the astonishing contradictions of capitalism and completely reveals the roots of the aggressive plundering policy of capitalist countries. This law leads to the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism and the inevitable maturation and outbreak of all contradictions in capitalist society.

	In stark contrast to the decaying capitalism is the rising and flourishing socialist system. The main characteristics and conditions of the basic economic law of socialism discovered by Stalin are: "through the continuous development and improvement of socialist production on a superior technological basis, ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the constantly increasing material and cultural needs of all members of society." (Ibid) Stalin has explained that the purpose of the socialist mode of production is not for profit, but for people and their needs, for the satisfaction of their material and cultural needs. Ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the constantly increasing material and cultural needs of the whole society is the purpose of socialist production, while the continuous development and improvement of socialist production on the highest technological basis is the means to achieve this purpose. The operation of this law leads to the rise of social production, the prosperity of society, and the constant improvement of the material well-being and cultural level of the working people.

	Stalin's discoveries about the basic economic laws of modern capitalism and socialism have dealt a fatal blow to all defenders of capitalism. These basic economic laws prove that in capitalist society, people are subjected to the ruthless law of maximizing profits, which is destined to make people suffer heavy hardships, poverty, unemployment, and bloody wars, while in socialist society, all production serves people and their constantly increasing needs. The decisive superiority of communism—a new and higher social system over capitalism—lies in this. (Applause)

	The realization of communism is the result of the conscious creative work of hundreds of millions of working people. Spontaneity and voluntarism are completely incompatible with the entire socialist economic system. Due to the law of competition and the anarchic state of production, the capitalist economy is being destroyed by extremely sharp contradictions. Stalin points out that due to the socialization of the means of production, a law of planned (proportional) development of the national economy has emerged in our country, which is a law completely opposite to the law of competition and the anarchic state of production.

	The law of planned development of the national economy is not the basic economic law of socialism, but our planned practice, if it does not consider the main task of socialist production and does not proceed from the basic economic law of socialism, cannot produce the desired positive results on its own. To ensure the continuous improvement of the entire social production, to manufacture abundant products in our country, we must fully master the art of planned and rational use of all material, financial, and labor resources, and in doing so, we must proceed from the requirements of the law of planned development of the national economy and make all our activities conform to the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism.

	In his work on economic issues, Stalin explained that we must perform extremely complex tasks in our struggle against difficulties and overcome all contradictions that arise in the process of building communism.

	Stalin discovered the objective economic law that production relations must correspond to the nature of the productive forces, and argued for the great cognitive and transformative role of this law. Stalin brilliantly expounded the processes taking place in our economy, pointing out that the view that there are no contradictions between production relations and productive forces under the socialist system is completely wrong. Undoubtedly, contradictions now exist and will continue to exist, because the development of production relations always lags behind the development of productive forces and will continue to lag behind. Of course, in a socialist society, this contradiction usually will not reach the point of conflict between production relations and productive forces, but it is dangerous to ignore the fact that they have and can have contradictions. We must timely pay attention to these contradictions and adopt correct policies to timely overcome these contradictions, so that production relations, as the main and decisive force regulating the powerful development of productive forces, can fulfill this role.

	Our task of advancing is that the workers of the party and social scientists, especially economists, must, in accordance with Stalin's programmatic instructions, closely combine theory with practical construction work, and comprehensively study the theoretical problems of Marxism-Leninism.

	Stalin's works vividly show how much importance our party attaches to theory. Revolutionary theory has been, is, and will continue to be an eternal beacon, illuminating the path of our party and our people towards the complete victory of communism. (Stormy applause)

	Stalin has been tirelessly developing Marxist theory. In Stalin's classic work "Marxism and the Problems of Linguistics," the basic propositions of Marxist theory on the laws of social development are raised to a new and higher level, the problems of the economic base and superstructure of society, the problems of productive forces and production relations are fully expounded. The theory of dialectical and historical materialism, as the theoretical foundation of communism, is further developed. Stalin discovered the role of language as a tool of social development and pointed out the prospects for further development of national culture and language. In this work, Stalin enriched Marxist-Leninist science with new propositions and opened up new prospects for various fields of knowledge.

	Stalin's works on economic problems and linguistics mark a new stage in the development of Marxism; these works are outstanding examples of creative interpretations of the teachings of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. Stalin teaches us that any dogmatic understanding of theory is unacceptable and will have extremely harmful effects in the political education of the masses. Stalin's theoretical discoveries have world-historical significance; these discoveries, armed with the knowledge of revolutionary methods of social transformation and the rich experience accumulated by our party in the struggle for the realization of communism, have armed the peoples of all countries. (Stormy, sustained applause)

	The great significance of Stalin's theoretical works lies in their warning us not to be superficial, in their penetrating into the essence of phenomena, into the essence of the process of social development; in their teaching us to be able to see, in their budding stage, those phenomena that can determine the course of events, giving us the possibility of Marxist foresight.

	The teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin have given our party an invincible power, the ability to open up new paths in history, the ability to clearly see the goals of our advance, and the ability to win and consolidate victories more quickly and more resolutely.

	The thoughts of Lenin and Stalin illuminate the tasks and prospects of the struggle of the masses of all peoples against imperialism, for peace, democracy, and socialism with the brilliant light of revolutionary theory. (Stormy, sustained applause)

	Comrades!

	The Soviet state is no longer an isolated island surrounded by capitalist countries. We are advancing side by side with the great Chinese people (sustained applause), and with the hundreds of millions of people of the people's democratic countries and the German Democratic Republic. (Sustained applause) All progressive humanity sympathizes with us and supports us. (Sustained applause) We are advancing together with all these forces to defend the cause of peace and friendship among all peoples.

	Our motherland is in a period of vigorous development, advancing towards new victories. We have all the necessary conditions to build a complete communist society. The natural resources of the Soviet state are inexhaustible. Our country has shown its ability to use these vast resources for the benefit of the working people. The Soviet people have demonstrated their ability to build a new society, and they confidently look to the future. (Sustained applause)

	Leading the peoples of the Soviet Union is the party that consistently implements Lenin-Stalin policies, tempered in battle. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, socialism has achieved victories of world-historical significance in the Soviet Union, and the phenomenon of man exploiting man has been permanently eliminated. Under the leadership of the party, the peoples of the Soviet Union are fighting victoriously for the great goal of building communism within our country. (Sustained applause)

	There is no force in the world that can stop the advance of Soviet society. Our cause is an invincible cause. We must firmly hold the helm and follow our own path, never yielding to provocations or threats. (Long, stormy, sustained applause)

	Under the banner of the immortal Lenin, under the wise leadership of the great Stalin, advance towards the victory of communism! (After the report, all representatives stood up and gave stormy, sustained cheers, expressing their warm respect to Comrade Stalin. The cheers echoed throughout the hall: "Hurrah for the great Stalin!" "Dear Stalin, hurrah!" "Long live our beloved leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin!")

    苏联共产党（布）中央委员会的报告
    ——苏联共产党（布）中央委员会书记马林科夫在苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会上所作（续昨）
    （三）党
    我们苏维埃祖国的力量的不断增长，是共产党的正确政策和它在执行这个政策时进行的组织工作的结果。作为苏维埃社会的主导和领导力量的党，保证国家能及时准备进行积极的防御，把人民的一切努力在战争年代用来击灭敌人，在战后时期用来使国民经济获得新的强大的提高。
    苏联人民在伟大卫国战争中所取得的历史性胜利，第四个五年计划的提前完成，国民经济的进一步发展，苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平的提高，苏联社会在精神上和政治上一致的加强，我国各族人民的友谊的加强，和平民主阵营的一切力量团结在苏联的周围——证实我们党的政策的正确性的主要总结就是这样。（暴风雨般的经久不息的鼓掌）
    报告谈到的这个时期是党进一步加强的时期，是党的队伍完全统一和团结的巩固时期。我们党在和列宁主义的敌人进行的激烈斗争中所争取到的这种统一是党内状况和党内生活的最特征的特点。这就是我们党之所以有力量和不可战胜的根源。（经久不息的鼓掌）
    党的队伍的统一是使苏联人民在伟大卫国战争中取得胜利的决定性条件。在伟大卫国战争的最严重考验的日子里，当决定我们祖国命运问题的时候，我们党是以一个统一的战斗组织进行活动的，在我们自己的队伍里没有动摇，没有分歧的意见。在战争的结果上，我们可以看出我们党许多年来对马克思列宁主义的各种各样敌人，对托洛茨基—布哈林派蜕化分子，对力图使党脱离正确路线和破坏它队伍之统一的投降者和叛徒们所进行的不调和的斗争的全部巨大意义。已经证明这些卑鄙的叛徒和卖国分子期待苏联遭到军事进攻，指望在万分艰难的时候，在背后打击苏维埃国家，以讨好我国人民的敌人。由于粉碎了苏联境内反苏势力的核心、隐藏在地下的托洛茨基—布哈林派分子，由于在我们党和苏维埃组织内肃清了人民的敌人，党才得以及时地消灭了“第五纵队”在苏联出现的任何可能性，并使苏联在政治上准备积极的国防。不难了解：倘使我们没有及时地做好这一个工作，我们在战争期间就会陷于前后受夹攻的处境，我们就可能在战争中失败。
    党的队伍的不可动摇的团结，首先应归功于我们的领袖和导师——坚持党的列宁主义的统一的斯大林同志。（全场起立。暴风雨般的经久不息的鼓掌，之后转为欢呼。）党的队伍的统一，不论在过去、现在和将来，都永远是我们党的巩固和不可战胜的基础。在战争的严峻考验的烈火中、在克服战后困难的斗争中百炼成钢的党，在召开这次代表大会时，空前紧密地团结在中央委员会的周围，它更加强大、更加统一了。（暴风雨般的经久不息的鼓掌）
    我们党的力量在于它与广大群众之间的血肉联系，在于它是一个真正人民的党，它的政策符合于人民的切身利益。苏联工会以及共产主义青年团等群众组织在把劳动人民团结在党的周围并以共产主义的精神教育人民方面所起的作用大大地提高了。在保卫我们祖国的自由与独立和争取建成共产主义社会的斗争中，党与人民更加密切了，并且已经加强了党与广大劳动人民群众之间的联系。苏联人民一致拥护党的政策，对党完全信任。（暴风雨般的鼓掌）
    党的队伍的发展是党与群众之间的联系和党在苏联人民中的威望巩固的明证。在第十八次代表大会时，党在自己的队伍中共有党员一百五十八万八千八百五十二人，候补党员八十八万八千八百十四人，共计二百四十七万七千六百六十六人。截至一九五二年十月一日为止，党内共有六百八十八万二千一百四十五人，其中党员有六百零一万三千二百五十九人，候补党员有八十六万八千八百八十六人。（鼓掌）
    在伟大卫国战争期间，尽管党在前线遭到了巨大的损失，党员人数不但没有减少，反而增加了一百六十多万人。参加党的有苏联陆军和海军中在前线英勇作战的最坚强的战士，有在后方奋不顾身地去促成战胜敌人的工人阶级、集体农庄农民和苏维埃知识分子中的先进代表。
    战争结束以后，党中央委员会决定吸收新党员的工作稍微放慢一点，尽管这样，新党员的入党还是继续加速进行。党不能不注意到，党的队伍的迅速发展也有某些缺点，因为这会在某种程度上降低党的队伍的政治觉悟水平和党员的质量标准。党的队伍的数量的增加与党员和候补党员的政治教育水平之间形成了某种程度的不相称的现象。为了消除这种不相称的现象，并进一步改善党员的质量，中央委员会认为必须不再加速党的队伍的进一步发展，而集中党组织的注意力来提高党员和候补党员的政治水平。根据中央委员会的指示，党组织开始更仔细地选择新党员，提高对入党者的要求，并广泛展开提高共产党员的政治教育的工作。结果，党队伍的政治水平和我们干部的马克思列宁主义的觉悟有了无可置疑的提高。但是，并不能认为我们已经完成了党所提出的消除共产党员政治教育落后于党的队伍的发展这一现象的任务。情况既然是这样的，我们就必须继续实行限制入党并改进党员政治教育和党性锻炼的路线，因为党的有力不仅在于党员的数量，而首先是在于党员的质量。
    巩固党的机构、改进它们的活动和加强党组织的工作，在战后时期具有特别重要的意义。
    由于战争结束与转向和平建设而使国家面临的新任务，要求认真改进党内工作和提高党组织在国家与经济活动方面的领导水平。问题是在于：战时环境曾经使党不能不采取某些特殊的领导方法，也就在党机构与党组织的工作中产生了严重的缺点。这种缺点首先表现在下述事实上：党机构削弱了对党组织与思想工作的注意，因此，在党的许多组织里，这种工作变得无人照顾了。造成了党机关脱离群众的某种程度的危险，由政治领导机关，由战斗的有主动性的机关变成了行政调度的机关，没有能力反对各种地方性的、本位主义的及其他有害于国家利益的倾向，并且看不出公然歪曲党的经济建设政策与破坏国家利益的现象。
    为了制止这种危险并顺利地解决巩固地方党机构与加强党组织的工作的任务，必须消除忽视党的组织与思想工作的现象，并且制止诸如在党组织内实行行政式的领导方法之类的行为，因为这种行为使党的工作产生官僚主义，并且削弱党员群众的积极性与主动性。
    中央委员会规定把彻底实行党内民主和展开鼓励批评与自我批评，并在这个基础上加强党员群众对于党机构的活动的监督这一任务作为各个党组织注意的中心，因为这是提高整个党的工作、提高党组织与党员的积极性和主动性的关键。党所实行的展开党内民主和自我批评的措施，帮助党的组织在相当大的程度上克服了党的政治工作中的缺点，并且对于提高这工作起了重大的作用。在这基础上提高了党员的积极性和主动性，巩固了各个企业、集体农庄和机关的党的基层组织，活泼了它们的工作，加强了党员群众对于党机构的工作的监督并提高了党委会的全体会议和党的活动分子会议所起的作用。
    但是，如果我们看不出党的政治工作水平仍然落后于生活的需要并落后于党所提出的任务，那就是错误了。必须承认，在党组织的工作中是存在着缺点和错误的；在我们党组织的生活中仍然存在着不少恶劣的而且往往是不健康的现象，而这些必须知道、看到和揭露，才可以把它们加以消灭和克服，保证进一步的顺利前进。
    这些缺点、错误、恶劣的和不健康的现象是什么呢？因此党的任务是什么呢？（1）自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，作为揭露并克服我们的错误与缺点、我们的弱点和毛病的主要方法，远没有充分地展开，更没有在所有的党组织中展开。
    在党组织内对批评与自我批评在党和国家的生活中的作用还认识不足，并有对批评迫害和报复的现象。我们常常遇到一些工作人员，他们絮絮不休地表示对党忠诚，但是实际上，他们不能接受来自下面的批评，他们压制批评并对批评者施以报复。我们知道有不少以官僚主义的态度对待批评和自我批评的事实，这些事实给党的事业造成了巨大的损失，杀害党组织的主动性，损害领导机构在党员群众中的威信，在个别党组织内，甚至还产生了党的死敌——官僚主义者的反党作风。
    党不能忽视这个事实：凡是批评和自我批评受到压制的地方，凡是群众对组织和机关的活动的监督松弛的地方，就必然要产生官僚主义、腐化、甚至我们机构的个别环节瓦解等畸形现象。自然，这些现象并不是普遍存在的。现在我们的党是空前坚强和健康的。但是，我们必须了解，这些危险的、不健康的现象之所以没有普遍存在，是因为党使用了批评与自我批评的武器，及时地、公开地、勇敢地揭露了这些现象，并对自高自大、官僚主义和腐化的具体表现予以坚决的打击。领导的英明就在于它能够把危险在萌芽中即行看出，使其不能发展到变成一个威胁。
    批评与自我批评是党对那些损害党的健康机体的缺点、错误和病态现象进行斗争时所使用的久经试验的武器。批评与自我批评并不是削弱苏维埃国家和苏维埃社会制度，而是加强它们，这就是苏维埃社会制度的力量与生命力的特征。
    目前特别重要的是：展开自我批评与自下而上的批评，把那些阻碍对我们的缺点展开批评、压制批评及听任批评者遭到迫害与报复的人，当作党的死敌，与之进行无情的斗争。事情是这样：由于战争的胜利结束及战后时期巨大的经济成就，在党的队伍里就发展了一种对党组织、经济组织与其他组织中的缺点与错误不加批评的态度。事实表明：胜利已经在党的队伍中产生了自满、太平享福和庸俗自安的情绪，想要高枕无忧地歇一歇，依靠过去的功劳生活一下。出现了不少的工作人员，他们认为“我们什么都能够”、“我们什么都不在乎”、“样样都进行得很好”，并且认为用不着费力去从事像揭发工作中的缺点与错误，或与我们组织中不良的和不健康的现象作斗争之类令人不愉快的工作。这种在后果上有害的情绪已存在于我们一部分缺乏适当教育与党性不强的干部中。党、苏维埃和经济组织的领导者往往使集会、积极分子会议、全体会议和代表会议变成仪式，变为自我歌颂的场合，结果工作中的错误和缺点，毛病和弱点未能揭发出来，未能受到批评，这就加重了自满和沾沾自喜的情绪。太平观念侵入了党的组织。党、苏维埃、经济组织以及其他组织的人员麻痹大意、放松警惕，泄漏党和国家的机密的现象不一而足。有些工作人员为事务成就所迷乱，以致忘记了资本主义的包围仍然存在，苏维埃国家的敌人仍在不断地设法把他们的特务偷送到我们这里来，并利用苏维埃社会中的不坚定的分子来为他们的卑鄙的目的服务。
    为了胜利地向前推进我们的事业，我们必须坚决地与一切不良现象进行斗争，使党和全体苏联人集中注意力来消灭我们工作中的缺点，为此必须广泛地展开自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评。
    广大劳动人民群众积极参加反对我们工作中的缺点和我们社会生活中不良现象的斗争，生动地证明了苏维埃制度是真正民主的，苏联人民是具有高度政治觉悟的。自下而上的批评是千百万劳动人民的自发创造性和主动性的表现，是他们关心巩固苏维埃国家的表现。我们越广泛地展开自我批评和自下而上的批评，我们就越能充分发掘我们人民的创造力与精力，群众的国家主人翁感觉也就愈加发展和加强。
    以为自下而上的批评能够以自流的方式自动展开的看法，是错误的。只有在每一个提出健康的批评的人能够确实知道他可以得到我们组织的支持，确实知道他所指出的缺点会真正予以去除的时候，自下而上的批评才能展开，才能生长和扩大。必须使党组织和党的工作人员与我们的一切领导者应该领导这个运动，并树立对批评采取诚恳的、自觉的态度的榜样。每个领导者，特别是党的工作者，都有责任创造条件，使一切正直的苏联人民都能够大胆而毫无畏惧地批评我们的组织与机关工作中的缺点。各级组织所召开的会议、积极分子会议全体会议和代表会议，都必须真正地成为进行大胆尖锐地批评缺点的广阔讲台。
    对党、苏维埃、经济组织与其他组织工作中的缺点与毛病进行坚持的斗争，必须把这件事当作全党的日常工作。一个共产党员没有权利漠视工作中的不健康现象与缺点，更不能向党隐瞒这些东西。每个党员如果发现那一个组织的工作进行得不好，如果发现党和国家的利益遭受到损失，他有责任毫无顾虑地把缺点报告党的领导机构，一直到党的中央委员会。这是每一个共产党员的责任，是他对党的极重要的义务。有些领导者认为，如果他们的下属向党中央委员会报告缺点，他们的下属就是妨碍他们进行领导工作，破坏他们的威信。我们必须坚决消灭这种有害的、极端反党的看法。
    党的任务是充分展开批评和自我批评，消灭一切阻挡和妨碍批评的东西。在消灭我们工作中的缺点时，吸收的群众越多，对我们一切组织的活动的自下而上的监督就越强，我们在各种领域里的工作就越能顺利地前进。要始终一贯地实行批评和自我批评的口号，必须对一切阻碍批评的展开和对批评者实行迫害与报复的人进行坚决的斗争。不能展开批评和自我批评的工作人员是我们前进的障碍。他们还没有成熟得能做领导者，他们不能指望党的信任。
    （2）党和国家的纪律在一部分党组织、苏维埃组织、经济组织及其他组织的工作人员当中仍然很松弛。
    在我们的干部中间有不少工作人员对党和政府的决定采取敷衍的态度，不努力以积极性和坚持性使之实现，工作进行得不能令人满意，国家的利益受到损害，而他们对这种现象，却无动于衷。对党和政府的决定采取敷衍的态度，对执行这些决定采取消极的态度，这都是必须无情地予以根除的恶行。党所需要的不是办例行公事和敷衍了事的工作人员，不是把个人的安逸看得重于工作的人，而是把国家的利益看得高于一切、以忘我精神不懈地执行党和政府指示的战士。
    一种最危险最有害的违反党纪和国法的行为是：某些工作人员隐瞒他们所管辖的企业和机关的真实情况，夸饰他们的工作成绩。中央委员会和政府已经揭露了一些工作人员的事例，这些工作人员把他们本部门和本地方的狭隘的利益放在国家利益之上，以照顾他们所管辖的企业为藉口，对政府隐瞒他们所掌握的物资，以至走上了违犯党纪和国法的道路。此外，大家都知道的，有些经济方面的工作人员，在党组织的纵容下，提出了大大超过所需的原料和材料的清单，他们有些人在生产报告中制造一些藉口来为他们没有完成生产计划作辩护。
    还有少数工作人员，忘记委托他们管理的企业是国家企业，竟然企图把这些企业变为他们自己私人的财产。这种领导者——假如还可以这样称呼他的话——认为他能够做“随心所欲”的任何事情。
    （笑声）另外一种重大的恶行是，我们有不少的工作人员似乎认为党的决定和苏维埃的法律对他们没有约束力，他们想像我们有两种纪律：一种是对普通人的纪律，一种是对领导人的纪律。这些“领导人”认为：他们什么都可以干，他们可以完全无视国家和党所制定的法律和规章，可以违反苏维埃的法律，可以采取各种各样的专横行动。
    党要求全体党员，特别是领导干部，要忠诚老实，要认真履行他们对党和国家的责任。党是不能信任那些在行动上危害国家的利益，企图对政府耍手腕，欺骗党和国家的人的。任何欺骗党和国家的行为，不论采取的是什么方式，任何欺骗的企图；不论是隐瞒真相也好，歪曲真相也好，都只能被认为是极严重的违害党的罪行。现在大家应当了解：我们的党只有一个纪律，不论是普通党员还是领导人都要受它的约束；苏维埃法律同样地适用于全体苏维埃人，不论他职位的大小。对领导者说来，如果他们对于执行党和政府的决定采取不老实态度或者有非法和专横的行为，对他们的惩罚，不能因为他们的职位而打折扣。
    目前的任务是：坚决地肃清一切破坏党纪国法的行为；清除不负责任、废弛松懈以及对于党和政府的决定采取敷衍态度的行为；不断提高我们的所有工作人员对党和国家的责任感；无情地根除不忠诚、不老实的态度。任何对党隐瞒真相和有欺骗党的企图的工作人员都是不容许存留在党的队伍里的。一贯地维护我们国家的利益，积极不懈地为执行党和政府的决定而斗争，这是党和政府的每一个工作人员的最首要责任。
    （3）伟大的列宁指示说，组织工作中的主要点是正确地挑选人材和检查执行的情形，这个指示还没有很好地实现。
    事实表明：正确地挑选人材和检查执行的情形在实际上远没有成为中央和地方党、苏维埃和经济组织的领导工作中的主要点。
    没有很好地组织起来真正执行中央的指示及其决定、对这些指示与决定的执行情况没有适当的监督，这是苏维埃组织、经济组织与党组织的实际工作中最普遍的与根深蒂固的缺点之一。我们的组织与机构颁发了多得远超过需要的各种决定、指示与命令，但是它们很少关心这些决定是否执行和执行得怎样。而问题的实质是，这些决定应当正确地执行，而不是官僚主义地执行。对执行领导机关的指示采取不老实的不负责任的态度，是官僚主义的最危险与最恶劣的表现。经验说明：即使是优秀的工作者，如果对他们放任不管，没有监督，对他们的工作也不加以检查，他们也会变坏和官僚主义化的。
    在整个领导系统中、在所有一切组织与机关的工作中，自上至下，尽量加强监督和对决定执行情况的检查，这是党的极重要的任务。为了达到这个目的，必须提高所有组织与机关领导人对于检查党与政府的决定执行情形的个人责任感，必须认真改进中央与地方的监察与检查机构的工作，充实其人员，以便把这个工作交给权威的、有经验的、政治上敏感的、能够严格地保护国家利益的人去做。必须大大加强党的监督作用，把党组织的注意集中在检查党与政府的决定的执行情形上。我们的领导机关在进行一切与检查决定执行情形有关工作时，必须依靠广大的劳动人民群众、依靠党、工会与共产主义青年团组织，依靠地方苏维埃的积极分子。只有当自上而下的对执行情况的检查与自下而上的党与非党群众的检查配合起来的时候，才能保证及时地消灭我们的组织与机构工作中的缺点，才能造成使决定与指示得以及时地、确切地、布尔什维克式地执行的条件。
    干部是党和国家进行领导工作时的决定性力量，如果不适当地挑选干部和训练干部，那就不可能顺利地实现党的政治路线。挑选干部的主要任务是：竭力提高工作人员的质量，以忠于党和国家利益的、精通自己业务并能够把业务向前推进的人员来加强我们的党，国家和经济组织。
    由于党采取了这些步骤，领导干部的成员已大大改善了。但是这并不就是说，提高领导干部质量的问题已经全部解决了。现在所有经济部门都已采用了最先进的技术装备，苏联人民的文化水平也无比地提高了，因此，对于领导干部的要求也有了变化，对他们的要求比较高了。在工业与农业中以及党与国家机构中所有担任领导职位的，都必须是有文化的人、熟悉自己业务的专家、能够灌注新的力量，支持一切先进与进步的东西，并且能富于创造性地加以发展的人。我们已具有做到这一点的一切可能，因为现在供挑选和提拔合乎这个要求的领导干部的后备军比以前更加广大了。
    今天要进一步加强领导干部的成员，主要有赖于正确地组织考查和挑选工作人员的工作，因此，首先就要消灭干部工作中的缺点，错误和偏差。而我们在这个问题上的缺点是不少的。
    主要的缺点在于：有些领导者在挑选干部时不以他们的政治品质和业务能力为根据，而以亲戚关系、朋友关系和同乡关系为根据。常常有这样的事情发生：有些正直的、通晓业务的工作人员，因他们对缺点不肯容忍使领导上感到不舒服，结果便在各种藉口下被排挤出去了，而代之以品质可疑、或者完全不称职、但被一些领导人员认为随和可喜的人。这种违反党的挑选干部和提拔干部的方针的行为已在一些组织中形成了由自己人组成的小家庭，他们互相庇护，把他们那个集团的利益放在党和国家的利益之上。很自然，这种情况常常会引起堕落和腐化。乌里扬诺夫斯克的党组织就是一个例子，这一个州组织的领导机构中有一部分经济工作人员与苏维埃和党的工作人员已经堕落腐化，竟至挪用公款和盗窃国家财产。
    对于考查和挑选工作人员的问题采取文牍主义的和官僚主义的态度，对进一步改善领导机构的成份的工作是十分有害的。挑选工作人员常常是根据履历表和证件，而没有认真地审查他们的业务能力和政治品质。在挑选干部的工作中，不见工作人员本人就凭空批准或加以任命的不良作风已成为根深蒂固的东西。显而易见，对挑选干部问题采取这种形式主义的和官僚主义的态度，是不可能正确地决定所挑选的人员是否适于他所担负的工作的。不弄清一个工作人员的优缺点，就不能决定哪个岗位能够使他最好地发挥他个人的能力。
    党组织有责任保证我们党所确定的挑选与分配干部的原则，在我们的机构的每一个环节中都得到最严格的遵守。必须对亲戚关系和互相包庇进行不妥协的斗争，必须消灭对审查与挑选干部问题所采取的官僚主义态度。必须把党机关审查与挑选干部的工作提到更高的水平，必须大大加强党对苏维埃组织与经济机关中的这种工作的监督。
    目前的任务是使人材的挑选与对决定的执行情况的检查，真正成为中央与地方的党、苏维埃与经济组织领导工作中的主要点。应当记住：检查执行情况的目的主要是揭发缺点，揭露非法行为，帮助忠诚的工作人员、向他提出意见，惩罚不能改正错误的人，并且保证已通过的决定的执行，研究经验，并在这种经验的基础上保证既定任务得到比较正确的、有利的、经济的解决。我们决不能容忍对检查决定执行情形的问题采取官僚主义的态度；我们决不能害怕撤销或改正一个已通过的决定，如果它被发现是错误的或者不精确的话。检查决定的执行情形的工作是和克服挑选干部方面的缺点的任务不可分割地联系着的；应该根据检查的结果撤换不好的、不称职的、落后的、不老实的工作人员，而代之以优秀的、称职的、先进的、忠诚的人；检查决定执行情形的工作应该有助于提拔能够推动工作，维护国家利益的新人。
    （4）许多党组织低估了思想工作的重要性，因此，这种工作就落在党的任务后面，有些组织中，这种工作处于无人照顾的状态。
    思想工作是党的首要职责，不重视这种工作就可能给党和国家的利益造成无法弥补的损失。我们必须时刻记住：社会主义思想影响的任何削弱，都意味着资产阶级思想影响的增强。
    在我们苏维埃社会里，没有也不可能有资产阶级思想占统治地位的阶级基础。在我们国家里占统治地位的是社会主义思想，这种思想的不可动摇的基础是马克思列宁主义。但是在我国还有着资产阶级思想的残余，私有财产观念和道德的残余。这些残余是不会自行消亡的；它们是极其顽固并且能够增长的，因此，必须对它们进行坚决的斗争。我们也不能保证不受与我们背道而驰的观点、思想、和情调的侵蚀，这些东西或者来自国外，来自资本主义国家，或者来自国内，来自敌视苏维埃政权的但是还没有被我们党从根铲除的集团的残余。我们绝不能忘记：苏维埃国家的敌人正在设法传播、制造和煽动各种不健康的情调，从思想上来腐蚀我们社会中不坚定的人们。
    我们某些党组织只顾经济事务而忘记了思想问题，它们把这些问题搁置在一边。甚至先进的党组织如莫斯科党组织，对于思想工作也注意得不够。这就不能不引起不良的影响。凡是对于思想问题不加注意的地方，就给敌对的观点和观念的复活创造了肥土沃壤。异己分子，形形色色已被党粉碎了的反列宁主义集团的残余分子，都想抓住党组织因为某种原故未加重视，而使党的领导与影响削弱了的那些思想工作部门，利用这样的部门来宣传他们的路线，复活并散布各种非马克思主义的“观点”和“观念”。
    低估思想工作的重要性在很大程度上是我们一部分领导干部没有能提高自己的政治修养，充实马克思列宁主义的知识和吸取党的历史经验的结果。而没有这一点，就不可能成为真正的成熟的领导者。一个人如果在思想上和政治上落后，按照死记的公式生活、丧失对于新鲜事物的感觉，他就不能正确地分析国内外的形势，不能而且也不配站在运动的前列，而且迟早终有一天他会被现实生活抛弃。一个领导者只有经常地努力提高自己的修养，创造性地掌握马克思列宁主义，锻炼自己的列宁与斯大林式工作者的品质并使之臻于完美的地步，才能够胜任我们党的任务。
    党组织对于提高党员和候补党员在思想和政治方面的修养仍作得很差，它们没有很好地组织和督促党员和候补党员学习马克思列宁主义理论，因此，许多共产党员还缺乏关于马克思列宁主义的必要知识。提高党员和候补党员的政治知识是加强他们在各方面生活中的先进作用、提高党员群众的积极性和改善党组织的工作的必要条件。
    由于对思想工作的领导不够以及对于这种工作的内容缺乏监督，书籍、报纸和杂志中以及科学机关和其他思想工作机关的工作中常常发现严重的错误和偏差。由于党中央委员会的过问，在许多科学部门中已揭露了与苏联人不相容的习惯和传统，已经揭发了关闭批评之门与不容许批评的现象，揭露了并粉碎了资产阶级思想的各种表现以及各种庸俗歪曲的现象。众所周知的关于哲学、生物学、生理学、语言学和政治经济学的讨论揭露了各种科学部门在思想方面的严重缺点；推动了批评和辩论的展开，在科学发展中起了重要的作用。在科学界许多部门中存在的学阀式的统治业已被粉碎了。可是，在一些科学部门中，个别科学家集团的垄断现象还没有完全根除，它们排斥生长中的新生的力量，不接受批评，并企图用行政方法来解决科学问题。在互相吹嘘、包庇错误的腐烂的气氛中，任何科学部门都无法顺利发展；如果科学家企图建立单独的小集团的垄断，就必然会使科学停滞不前，以至腐化。
    党的思想工作应当在使人们的意识摆脱资本主义残余、旧社会的偏见和有害传统的工作中起重要的作用。今后必须在群众中培养高度的社会责任感，以苏维埃爱国主义和各族人民友好的精神、以关心国家利益的精神教育劳动人民，发展苏维埃人的最优秀的品质——确信我们事业的胜利，有克服任何困难的决心和能力。
    党组织的任务，在于坚决消灭这种低估思想工作之重要性的有害偏向，并在党和国家的各个环节中加强思想工作，不懈地揭露一切与马克思主义背道而驰的思想的表现。必须发展社会主义文化、科学、文学和艺术并使之趋于完善，动员一切思想和政治教育的工具、我们的宣传、鼓动工作和报刊，来改善共产党员的思想修养，提高工人、农民和知识分子的政治警惕性和政治觉悟。我们党的全体工作者，毫无例外地都必须努力提高自己的思想水平，并掌握党的丰富的政治经验，这样才不致落在现实生活的后面，才能胜任党的任务。党组织必须对党员与候补党员经常进行提高他们思想水平的工作，教他们学习马克思列宁主义，并培养他们成为有政治修养的、自觉的共产党员。
    在进一步巩固党的方面，我们任务如下：
    一、继续改善党的质量，不允许追求数量，而要集中力量于提高党员与候补党员的政治水平与马克思主义修养；提高共产党员的政治积极性，使全体党员都成为为实现党的政策与决议而斗争的坚强战士，使他们对工作中的缺点决不调和、并且能够为消灭缺点而不屈不挠地工作；改善工会与共产主义青年团的工作并使之臻于完善，随时加强与群众的联系，牢牢记住我党所以有力量与所以不可战胜，就在于它与人民的牢不可破的血肉联系；
    二、消除对我们的事业极其有害而危险的对成就自满与沾沾自喜的情绪，消灭党的队伍中的矜夸与漠视一切的现象，大胆地与坚决地揭发并消灭我们工作中的缺点与弱点；彻底地发扬党内民主，扩大自下而上的批评与自我批评，保证所有正直的苏联人民都可以大胆地与毫无畏惧地批评我们的组织与机关工作中的缺点，并对于所有压制批评、以迫害与报复对付批评的企图，进行无情的斗争，以各种方法加强党纪和国法，根除对党和政府的决定所持的敷衍态度，进行反对无纪律、反对危害国家利益的坚决斗争；
    三、把党机关在正确挑选、分配和培养干部的工作提到更高的水平，严格遵守党所规定的关于正确挑选干部的原则，对违反这些原则的人进行不调和的斗争，无情地打击在挑选干部方面所表现的官僚主义态度，改善领导干部的质量，更大胆地把忠于党和国家的利益、熟悉业务、并且能够进一步提高业务的人员提拔去做领导工作，撤换不好的、不适当的、落后的和不忠实的工作人员；以各种方法在整个领导系统中自上而下地对执行决定的情形加强监督和检查，提高一切组织与机关的领导者对于执行党和政府的决定的情形进行检查的个人责任心，把这种自上而下的检查和党员群众与非党群众所进行的自下而上的检查结合起来；保证正确地挑选干部和检查执行决定的情形真正成为中央与地方党组织、苏维埃与经济组织的领导工作的主要点；
    四、消灭轻视思想工作的现象，为反对对思想上的错误与偏差采取自由主义与漠不关心的态度而进行坚决斗争，有步骤地提高和改善我们干部的思想与政治的修养；动员一切思想教育工具，我们的宣传、鼓动与报纸，来对苏联人民进行共产主义教育；把苏维埃科学提到更高的水平，展开科学工作中的批评与辩论，并且记住：只有这样，苏维埃科学才能完成它的在世界科学中占居首位的使命；
    五、继续像保护眼珠一样地保护党的队伍的列宁主义的统一，因为这种统一是我们党的力量与不可战胜的基础。（暴风雨般的经久不息的鼓掌）
    同志们！
    在我们的时代中，马克思、恩格斯、列宁与斯大林的伟大学说给全人类照耀着世界文明发展的道路。
    我们的党是强大的，因为我们党的一切活动都是以马克思列宁主义的理论为指南的。我们党的政策是依靠社会发展规律的科学知识的。
    我们伟大的导师列宁与斯大林的历史的作用是在于：他们深刻钻研马克思主义的理论基础，充分地掌握了辩证法，保卫与维护了马克思主义不受任何歪曲，而且天才地发展了马克思主义学说。在历史上的每一个新的转折点，列宁与斯大林都把马克思主义与时代的一定实际任务联系在一起，他们创造性地阐扬马克思与恩格斯的学说，证明马克思主义不是死的教条，而是活的行动的指南。
    马克思列宁主义理论是斯大林同志不倦怠地研究的对象。在最近整个时期中，斯大林同志在理论方面的活动中心是阐释具有世界历史意义的问题——社会主义经济的发展问题及逐渐过渡到共产主义的问题。斯大林同志创造性地丰富了与发展了马克思列宁主义科学，从而在思想上武装了党与苏联人民，以争取我们事业的胜利。
    斯大林同志最近发表的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”对于马克思列宁主义理论以及对于我们的一切实际活动，都有极其伟大的意义。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的鼓掌）这部著作对于社会主义社会中物质财富的社会生产与分配的规律，作了全面的研究；它规定了社会主义经济发展的科学原则，指出了从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的道路。斯大林同志对经济学理论问题所作的阐释，大大地向前推进了马克思列宁主义政治经济学。
    斯大林同志提出了关于准备过渡到共产主义的基本先决条件的纲领式的原理。斯大林同志教导我们说，为了准备实际过渡到共产主义，至少必须实现三个基本的先决条件。
    “第一，必须可靠地加以保证的……是整个社会生产的不断增长，首先是生产资料生产的增长。生产资料生产的首先增长之所以必要，不仅是因为它应当以装备来保证它自己的企业以及国民经济其他一切部门的企业，而且是因为没有这种增长就根本不可能实现扩大的再生产。”（约·斯大林：“苏联社会主义经济问题”）
    “第二，必须用实行起来有利于集体农庄因而也有利于整个社会的逐渐过渡的办法来把集体农庄的所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，并且也用逐渐过渡的办法使产品交换制来代替商品流通制，以便中央政权或其他社会经济中心能够掌握社会生产的全部产品来为社会利益服务。”（同上）
    当然，在现时，我们正在成功地运用商品流通和集体农庄所有制来发展社会主义经济，它们对我们的社会无疑是有益的。在最近的将来，它们也仍然是有益的。但是，我们必须注意我们的发展前途。
    斯大林同志指出：“……如果让集体农庄集团所有制、商品流通等经济事实仍然发生效力，那就既不能获得能够满足社会一切需要的丰富生产品，也不能过渡到‘各取所需’的这个公式。”（同上）
    只要社会主义经济保存它的两个基本生产部分——国营部分和集体农庄部分，商品流通及其“货币经济”就必定继续发生作用——我们的国民经济体系中必要的和有用的因素的作用。商品生产和商品流通的存在还决定了价值法则在社会主义制度下的存在，虽然在我们的制度下，它已不再起生产调节者的作用了。
    但是，商品流通，和价值法则一样，不是永远存在的。在社会主义生产的两种基本形式——全民的形式和集体农庄的形式——让位于一个无所不包的生产部分时，商品流通及其“货币经济”就和价值法则一样地要消失。有些人认为商品流通在共产主义制度下将继续存在下去，这种看法与马克思主义毫无共同之处。商品流通与从社会主义过渡到共产主义的前途是不相容的。
    斯大林同志在理论上阐释了关于把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制水平的措施的问题、关于逐渐过渡到国营工业与集体农庄交换产品的制度的问题。目前存在的产品交换的雏型，即对种植棉花、亚麻、糖萝卜的集体农庄及其他集体农庄的“产品供给”，将发展成为广泛的产品交换制度。
    斯大林同志指出：“这样的制度需要城市送交农村的产品大量地增加，所以推行这种制度无需特别急忙，要随着城市制成品积累的程度而行。但是这种制度应该一贯地毫不犹豫地进行，以一步一步地缩小商品流通的活动范围，扩大产品交换的活动范围。
    “这样的制度缩小着商品流通的活动范围，使社会主义易于过渡到共产主义。此外，它将给予可能把集体农庄的基本财产集体农庄生产的产品包括进全民计划化的总的系统中。
    “为了在我国现今条件之下，把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，这将是实际的和有决定意义的办法。”（同上）
    产品交换制度毫无疑问地是有利于集体农民的，因为这些农民将从国家方面取得比在商品流通的情况下多得多的而且价格更低的产品。现在已经享受着“产品供给”——这是产品交换的雏形——的集体农庄现在都亲身感到这个制度所给予的巨大优点和好处。大家都知道，许多这样的集体农庄都是最富裕的农庄。
    斯大林同志指出：为了准备过渡到共产主义的基本先决条件，“第三，必须达到这样的社会文化的高涨，保证社会的一切成员全面发展体力和脑力，使社会成员有可能获得足以成为社会发展的积极活动家的教育，有可能自由地选择职业，而不致由于现存的社会分工终身束缚于一种什么职业。”（同上）
    “为此首先需要缩短劳动时间至少到六小时，然后再到五小时。这是使社会成员有充分自由的时间来获得全面的教育所必需的。其次，为此，需要实行普及义务技术教育，这是使社会成员有可能自由地选择职业，而不至于终身束缚于一种什么职业所必需的。再次，为此必需根本改善居住条件和提高工人和职员的实际工资最低限度至少到两倍，不仅用直接提高货币工资的办法，而且，特别是，用继续不断降低日用品价格的办法来做到这点。”（同上）
    斯大林同志教导我们说：只有实现了所有这些先决条件以后，我们才能希望：劳动在社会成员的眼中，将不再成为资本主义社会中那样沉重的负担，而将成为第一生命攸关的需要，而社会所有制将被社会全体成员认为是社会存在的不可震撼的和不可侵犯的基础。只有在所有这些先决条件全部实现以后，才有可能从社会主义的公式“各尽所能，按劳取酬”过渡到共产主义的公式“各尽所能，各取所需”。
    斯大林同志坚持不渝地警告说：不要轻浮地采取过早的行动，不要还没有创造好过渡所必需的先决条件，就过渡到较高的经济形式去。
    斯大林同志为城乡对立、体力劳动和智力劳动对立的消灭这样重要的社会问题和纲领性的共产主义问题，提供了科学的解决办法，并且详细论述了在社会主义社会中仍然存在的城市与乡村、体力劳动与智力劳动间本质差别的消灭问题——马克思主义科学中的一个新问题。
    因此，党关于未来的计划即决定我们的前途以及我们在前进中所要遵循的道路，就是依据经济法则的知识，依据斯大林同志所阐明的建设共产主义社会的科学而制定的。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的鼓掌）
    斯大林同志关于经济法则的客观性的论证具有巨大的原则重要性。斯大林同志教导我们说，经济发展法则，政治经济学法则——不论我们是在研究资本主义还是社会主义——是反映经济发展过程的客观法则，这种客观法则是不以人们的意志为转移而进行的。人们能发现这些法则，认识它们，利用它们来服务于社会利益，但是他们不能消灭旧的经济法则，或创造新的经济法则。经济法则并不是由于人们的意志而创造的，而是在新的经济条件的基础上产生的。
    有人以为可以随意创造或废除经济发展法则，以为由于历史所赋予苏维埃国家的特别作用，苏维埃国家就可以取消现存的政治经济学法则、“制订”新的法则或“改造”现有的法则，这些观点都是十分错误的。否定社会主义的经济生活中的客观经济规律性会引起混乱和意外事件。那样就会使得政治经济学不成其为科学，因为如果科学不承认和研究客观规律性，科学就不能昌明和发展。否定经济法则的客观性是经济政策方面冒险主义和实际指导经济中极端专断的态度的思想基础。
    斯大林同志关于现代资本主义的基本经济法则和社会主义的基本经济法则的发现，是对于马克思主义的政治经济学的巨大贡献。这个基本经济法则说明了一定生产方式的本质、它的一切主要方面及它的发展的基本过程；这个法则为了解和解释一定经济制度的一切法则提供了锁钥。
    斯大林同志证明了：现代资本主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求是：“用剥削本国大多数居民并使之破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家、特别是落后国家的人民的办法，最后用那些可以用来保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大的资本主义利润。”（同上）这个法则揭露并说明了资本主义的惊人矛盾，而且把资本主义国家的侵略掠夺政策的根源完全揭露出来了。这个法则的作用导致资本主义总危机的加深，并且引起资本主义社会一切矛盾的必然成熟和爆发。
    与腐朽的资本主义完全相反的是上升的、繁荣的社会主义制度。斯大林同志发现的社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和条件是：“通过在优越的技术基础上进行的社会主义生产的不断发展和不断趋于完善，保证社会所有成员的不断增加的物质和文化要求得到最大限度的满足。”（同上）斯大林同志已经说明，社会主义生产方式的目的不是为了利润，而是为了人和他的需要，为了满足他的物质需要和文化需要。保证整个社会的不断增加的物质需要和文化需要得到最大限度的满足是社会主义生产的目的，而在最高的技术基础上进行的社会主义生产的不断的发展和趋于完善则是达到这个目的的手段。这种法则所发生的作用就要导向社会生产力的高涨，社会的繁荣以及劳动人民的物质福利和文化水平的不断提高。
    斯大林同志关于现代资本主义的基本经济法则和社会主义的基本经济法则的发现，给予资本主义的一切辩护者以致命的打击。这些基本经济法则证明：在资本主义社会里，人是服从于榨取最大利润的无情法则，这种情形注定人们要忍受沉重的苦难、贫穷、失业和流血的战争，而在社会主义社会里，一切生产都要服从人和他的不断增加的需要。共产主义——一种比资本主义更高级的新的社会制度——的有决定意义的优越性就在于此。（鼓掌）
    共产主义的实现是亿万劳动人民自觉的创造工作的结果。自流和自发论是和整个社会主义经济制度绝不相容的。由于竞争法则与生产的无政府状态，资本主义经济被极尖锐的矛盾摧毁着。斯大林同志指出：由于生产资料的社会化，在我国出现了有计划地（成比例地）发展国民经济的法则，这是一种和竞争法则与生产的无政府状态完全相反的法则。
    有计划发展国民经济的法则，不是社会主义的基本经济法则，而我们计划化的实践如果不考虑社会主义生产的主要任务，不依据社会主义基本经济法则，它自己是不能产生应有的积极结果的。为了保证整个社会生产的不断提高，为了在我国制造丰足的产品，我们必需完全掌握有计划地、合理地利用一切物质的、财政的和劳动的资源的艺术，在这样做时，应从有计划发展国民经济的法则的要求出发，并且使我们的一切活动都适应社会主义基本经济法则的要求。
    斯大林同志在他关于经济问题的著作里说明了，我们要在和困难作斗争时执行极为复杂的任务，要克服在建设共产主义过程中所产生的一切矛盾。
    斯大林同志发现了生产关系一定要适应生产力的性质这一客观经济法则，并论证了这个法则的巨大的认识作用和改造作用。斯大林同志英明地阐明了我们的经济中所发生的过程，指出那种认为在社会主义制度下生产关系和社会生产力之间没有任何矛盾的观点是十分错误的。毫无疑问，矛盾现在是存在的，而且将来也是存在的，因为生产关系的发展总是落后于生产力的发展，而且要继续落后。自然，在社会主义社会中，这个矛盾通常不会达到使生产关系和生产力间发生冲突的程度，但是，如果看不到它们之间有着并且能够有矛盾，那是危险的。我们必须及时注意到这些矛盾，并采取正确的政策及时克服这些矛盾，以使生产关系，作为规定生产力强大发展的主要的与决定的力量，来完成它的这种作用。
    我们向前行进的任务，是要党的工作者和社会科学工作者，首先是经济学家，必须本着斯大林的纲领性的指示，密切联系实际建设工作，全面研究马克思列宁主义理论问题。
    斯大林同志的著作生动地表明了我们党对于理论是给予多么重大的意义。革命的理论过去是、现在是、将来仍然是一座不灭的明灯，照耀着我们的党和我们的人民走向共产主义完全胜利的道路。（暴风雨般的鼓掌）
    斯大林同志在不倦地发展着马克思主义的理论。在斯大林同志的经典著作“马克思主义与语言学问题”中，马克思主义关于社会发展规律性的理论的基本命题提到新的更高的水平，社会的经济基础和上层建筑的问题、生产力与生产关系的问题，都得到了全面的阐释。作为共产主义的理论基础的辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的学说，得到进一步的发展。斯大林同志发现了语言作为社会发展的一个工具的作用，他并且指出了进一步发展民族文化和语言的远景。斯大林同志在这部著作中用新的命题丰富了马克思列宁主义科学，并为各种知识领域开拓了前进的新远景。
    斯大林同志关于经济问题和语言学问题的著作，标志着马克思主义的发展的一个新阶段；这些著作是对于马克思、恩格斯和列宁的学说作创造性阐述的卓越典范。斯大林同志教导我们说，任何对理论作教条式的理解都是不能容许的，在群众的政治教育工作中会发生极其有害的作用。斯大林同志的理论发现，具有全世界历史性的意义，这种理论发现，以革命改造社会方法的知识以及我党在为实现共产主义的斗争中所积累的丰富经验，武装了各国人民。（暴风雨般的经久不息的鼓掌）
    斯大林同志的理论著作的巨大意义，在于它们警告我们不要光看表面，在于它们深入到现象的深处，深入到社会发展过程的本质；在于它们教导我们对于那些能决定事变发展进程的现象，在其萌芽时期就能看出，给予我们有马克思主义预见的可能。
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的学说给了我们的党以不可战胜的力量，在历史上开拓新道路的本领，清晰地看到我们前进运动的目标的本领，更快地、更坚决地赢得而且巩固胜利的本领。
    列宁和斯大林的思想以革命理论的灿烂光辉照亮着各国人民大众反对帝国主义、争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争的任务和远景。（暴风雨般的经久不息的鼓掌）
    同志们！
    苏维埃国家现在再不是一个被资本主义国家包围的孤岛了。我们正和伟大的中国人民并肩前进（经久不息的鼓掌），和各人民民主国家及德意志民主共和国的千百万人民一道向前迈进。（经久不息的鼓掌）全体进步人类同情我们并支持我们。（经久不息的鼓掌）我们正和所有这些力量一道保卫和平与各族人民友好的事业。
    我们的祖国正处在蓬勃发展的时期，向着新的胜利迈进。我们有着建成一个完全的共产主义社会的一切必要条件。苏维埃国家的天然财富是取之不尽的。我们国家已表明它有能力利用这种巨大的财富来为劳动人民谋福利的。苏联人民已经显示了他们建设新社会的本领，他们满怀信心地展望着将来。（经久不息的鼓掌）
    领导着苏联各族人民的是一贯执行列宁—斯大林政策的、久经战斗百炼成钢的党。在共产党的领导下，社会主义在苏联取得了具有全世界历史意义的胜利，人剥削人的现象已经永远消灭。在党的领导下，苏联各族人民正在为了实现在我们国内建成共产主义的伟大目标而胜利地战斗着。（经久不息的鼓掌）
    世界上没有那一种力量能够阻止苏维埃社会的前进。我们的事业是不可战胜的事业。我们必须坚定地掌着舵，走自己的道路，决不在挑衅或恫吓下屈服。（长时间的暴风雨般的经久不息的鼓掌）
    在永远不朽的列宁的旗帜下，在伟大的斯大林的英明领导下，向着共产主义的胜利前进！
    （在报告完毕以后，全体代表都起立，发出暴风雨般的、经久不息的欢呼声，向斯大林同志热烈地表示敬意。欢呼声响遍了整个大厅：“乌拉！伟大的斯大林万岁！”、“亲爱的斯大林，乌拉！”、“我们敬爱的领袖与导师斯大林同志万岁！”）
