    Xinhua News Agency, Washington dispatch: Hundreds of thousands of bituminous coal miners belonging to the United Mine Workers of America are staging a spontaneous strike to protest the Truman administration's unreasonable infringement upon the wage increase rights that the workers have already obtained. In September, the United Mine Workers of America had the capitalists agree in the new contract to stipulate a wage increase of $1.90 per day for each coal miner. However, the Truman administration's "Wage Stabilization Board" infringed upon the workers' legitimate rights and, in the name of "preventing inflation," ordered that only $1.50 be allowed. The workers are very angry about this anti-labor decision of the US government. Although the United Mine Workers of America has not issued any formal strike call, the workers have spontaneously gone on strike, demanding the fulfillment of the original agreement and declaring that they will not work without a contract.
    The strike spread rapidly, and the number of strikers increased to 168,000 overnight and continued to increase. As of the 22nd, more than 320,000 of the 375,000 bituminous coal miners in the United States had participated in the strike. Almost all bituminous coal mines across the United States have been shut down as a result. In West Virginia, 95,000 workers went on strike, shutting down all bituminous coal mines in the state. In central Pennsylvania, all coal mines have been shut down, and only one mine in western Pennsylvania is still in operation. In Kentucky, all 50,000 bituminous coal miners have gone on strike.

    美国烟煤工人罢工
    全国烟煤矿几全部停闭
    【新华社讯】华盛顿消息：美国联合煤矿工人工会所属数十万烟煤工人，为抗议杜鲁门政府无理侵害工人们业已取得的增加工资的权益，举行自发罢工。联合煤矿工人工会在九月曾使资方同意在新合同中规定煤矿工人每人每日工资增加一点九美元，但是杜鲁门政府的“工资稳定委员会”却侵犯工人们的合法权益，以“防止通货膨胀”为名，下令只许增加一点五美元。工人们对美国政府这一反劳工的决定非常愤慨。虽然联合煤矿工人工会没有发表任何正式的罢工号召，工人们却纷纷自动罢工，要求履行原协议的合同，并表示没有合同就不工作。
    罢工迅速扩展，罢工人数一夜之间即增至十六万八千人，并继续不断增加。到二十二日止，美国全国三十七万五千名烟煤工人中参加罢工者已达三十二万人以上。美国全国各烟煤矿已因此几乎全部停闭。在西弗吉尼亚州，有九万五千名工人罢工，使该州所有烟煤矿停闭。在宾夕法尼亚州中部，所有煤矿场都已停工，该州西部的煤矿中，只有一个矿场尚在开工。在肯塔基州，五万名烟煤矿工人已全部停工。
