The wage reform work in state-owned factories and mines in the Central and Southern Region, which began universally in early September, was basically completed in early October. The advanced eight-grade wage system has now been basically implemented throughout the region.

This wage reform was carried out on the basis of generally not reducing wages and increasing the total wage fund. As a result, 70 to 80 percent of workers and staff have had their wages increased, with some factories increasing the wages of more than 90 percent of their total workforce. Many factories and mines have also reissued wages in accordance with the new wage standards. After the wage reform, the lives of workers and staff in factories and mines have been further improved. In a certain iron smelting plant, in addition to using the reissued wages to buy clothes and bicycles, some employees even bought watches and radios. The new savings deposited in the People's Bank accounted for 34 percent of the total reissued wages. Many factories and mines held celebrations after the wage reform to celebrate the improvement of their lives.

During the wage reform process, the leadership of each factory and mine paid attention to ideological mobilization. Therefore, when evaluating wage grades, the masses of workers and staff were able to master the technical standards and realize the principle of "to each according to his work." Tan Qingchang, a fitter at the Huaxin Cement Company's repair shop, said happily after the grading: "This grading is really reasonable. Before the grading, I guessed that I was grade four, but I was still a little worried that people would say that I was too old and would not be able to be graded up. Now it's really appropriate to grade me four." Workers at the Guangdong Steel Plant's foundry shop happily said after the wage grades were determined: "Measure one foot with a one-foot ruler, the eight-grade wage system is really good!"

The new wage system and reasonable work quotas have greatly encouraged workers' enthusiasm for production and their zeal for learning technology. Workers in many factories and mines have compiled the technical standards into songs and sing them whenever they have time. Some even write them on the walls and in their diaries and study them whenever they have time. After the wage reform in state-owned factories and mines in Nanchang, workers' incomes increased, and they actively purchased books to strengthen their learning. Books on production and machinery at the Nanchang Xinhua Bookstore have been sold out, and many workers have written to other places to order them.

Currently, this enthusiasm for production and learning technology has greatly promoted the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. After determining wage grades, the Central and Southern Electrical Factory immediately mobilized workers to formulate a more advanced Increase Production and Practice Economy plan. Many state-owned factories and mines such as a certain steel company in Central and Southern China and Huaxin Cement Company also launched large-scale Increase Production and Practice Economy Movements at the end of September and the beginning of October, immediately following the wage reform.

### 中南区国营厂矿工资改革工作基本结束

    中南区国营厂矿工资改革工作基本结束
    中南区国营厂矿的工资改革工作，自九月初普遍开展以来，已在本月初基本结束。现在全区已基本上实行先进的八级工资制。
    这次工资改革是在一般不降低工资并增加工资总基金的基础上进行的。因此，百分之七十至八十的工人职员都增加了工资，有的工厂增加工资的人数达到总人数的百分之九十以上。很多厂矿并按照新的工资标准，补发了工资。经过工资改革，厂矿中的工人和职员们的生活都有了进一步的改善。某炼铁厂职工除了用补发的工资买了衣服、自行车，有的还买了手表和收音机等用品以外，新储蓄到人民银行的款项，就占补发工资总数的百分之三十四。很多厂矿工资改革之后，都举行了庆祝大会，庆祝自己生活的改善。
    在工资改革过程中，各厂矿领导方面都注意了思想发动工作，因而在评定工资等级时，职工群众都能掌握技术标准，实现按劳取酬的原则。华新水泥公司修理场钳工谭庆昌评级后高兴地说：“这次评级真合理，没评以前我就揣测我是四级，可是还有点顾虑，怕大家说我年纪大了，评不上去，现在评我四级真合适。”广东炼钢厂铸工场工人们，在评定工资等级以后都高兴地说：“有一尺量一尺，八级工资制真好！”
    新的工资制度和合理的工作定额大大鼓舞了工人们的生产积极性和学习技术的热情。很多厂矿的工人把技术标准编成歌子，一有空就唱，有的更把它写在墙上和日记本上，一有空就研究。南昌各地方国营厂矿工资改革后，工人们的收入增加了，都积极购买书籍加强学习，南昌新华书店有关生产、机械方面的书籍已销售一空，很多工人并向外地写信订购。
    目前这种生产积极性和学习技术的热情，已大大地推动了增产节约运动。中南电工厂在评定工资等级后，即发动工人订立了较先进的增产节约计划；中南某钢铁公司和华新水泥公司等很多国营厂矿也都在九月底和十月初，紧接着工资改革之后，展开了大规模的增产节约运动。（新华社）
