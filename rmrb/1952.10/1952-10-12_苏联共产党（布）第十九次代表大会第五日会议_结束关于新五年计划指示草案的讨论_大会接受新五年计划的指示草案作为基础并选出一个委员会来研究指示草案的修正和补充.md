Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 10th (TASS): The fifth day session of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on the morning of October 9th continued the discussion of M.Z. Saburov's report on the directives of the 19th Party Congress regarding the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union for 1951-1955 (the Fifth Five-Year Plan). All speakers unanimously pointed out that the new Five-Year Plan is a major step towards communism, and the Soviet people recognize that the implementation of this great plan is closely related to them, and they will do their best to complete and overfulfill this plan. The delegates to the Congress emphasized that the purpose of the new Five-Year Plan is to strengthen the strength of the Soviet state and improve the living standards of the Soviet people, and at the same time it is a huge contribution to strengthening the cause of international peace, democracy and socialism.
	Comrade Batolichev chaired the meeting.
	Comrade Yasnov, a representative from Moscow, spoke first, saying that the draft directives of the Congress on the new Five-Year Plan formulate a program for the further development of the national economy and culture for the Soviet state, which is confidently advancing towards communism.
	Comrade Yasnov then reported on the prospects for the development of Moscow. The government has, in accordance with Comrade Stalin's instructions, formulated and approved a master plan for the reconstruction of the capital in 1951-1960. The plan stipulates further improvements to the city of Moscow. According to the plan, 10 million square meters of housing will be built in Moscow within ten years. The houses built in Moscow during the Fifth Five-Year Plan must be three times the number built during the Fourth Five-Year Plan. The number of schools, medical institutions and cinemas will increase, and urban transportation and public utilities will be further developed.
	The construction of the subway's large circular line, which is about 20 kilometers long, will be completed next year. The plan also stipulates an increase in the gas supply of the capital.
	The construction of skyscrapers in Moscow marks a new stage in the development of socialist cities and proves the high level of Soviet architecture and the development of our construction industry. These skyscrapers fundamentally change the overall appearance of the capital.
	Yasnov then talked about many issues regarding the organization of construction work and reducing construction costs. The correct resolution of these issues is of particular importance to the great construction work stipulated in the draft directives of the Congress.
	Yasnov said that we know the responsibility that the Party and the government have entrusted to us to complete the grand plan to rebuild the capital. The Moscow Party organization and all residents of Moscow will faithfully complete this task.
	When Comrade Mikoyan, one of J.V. Stalin's comrades-in-arms, appeared on the podium, the venue erupted in a storm of sustained applause.
	Mikoyan said that the report of the Central Committee, the documents drafted by the Central Committee for the Party Congress, and Comrade Stalin's recently published brilliant work on socialist economic issues illuminate, with the light of Stalin's genius, the path already traveled and the path to the increasingly clear communist society.
	Comrade Mikoyan said that as our powerful Party convenes the Nineteenth Congress, we should pay tribute to the person who educated us, organized us, led us through various difficulties and trials, and is now leading us to the complete victory of communism, that is, to the genius, the great architect of communism, Stalin. When he said these words, the audience applauded warmly.
	Most of Mikoyan's speech was a report on the work of the consumer goods industry. He pointed out that the remarkable feature of the development of the Soviet food industry is the rapid increase in the production of the most valuable items such as meat, dairy, fish products, fruits, and sugar, in order to meet the increasing needs of the residents. In the United States, meat production in 1951 decreased by 437,000 tons compared to 1946, while meat production in the Soviet Union increased by 700,900 tons during the same period.
	Mikoyan then talked about the broad prospects for the development of the slaughtering industry, fishing industry, sugar refining industry and other industries in the new Five-Year Plan.
	Mikoyan talked about the retail sales of goods increasing by more than double compared to 1948. He pointed out that the increase in sales of automobiles, motorcycles, bicycles, radios, televisions, furniture, refrigerators, musical instruments, etc. in recent years vividly reflects the improvement of the material welfare of the Soviet people. Another clear fact that the residents' welfare is constantly improving and that they have confidence in the Soviet currency is that in 1952, residents' deposits in savings banks increased three times compared to 1940. Due to the continuous reduction of prices in the past five years, the level of consumer goods prices has generally decreased by 50%.
	Mikoyan cited figures to show that in capitalist countries, on the one hand, food prices continue to rise, and on the other hand, monopoly capitalists are implementing a policy of raising prices and lowering wages in order to pursue excess profits.
	The concluding part of Mikoyan's speech was about the Soviet Union's foreign trade. He pointed out that the volume of Soviet foreign trade is now three times that of the pre-war period. Trade with countries in the democratic camp now accounts for the majority of foreign trade. Economic cooperation among the countries of the democratic camp—this new world market—is unfolding on the solid basis of the planned development of these countries' economies and the close coordination of each country's economic plans with each other; this economic cooperation is established on the basis of equal rights for large and small countries, respect for mutual interests, and mutual assistance in economic development.
	Mikoyan concluded his speech by cheering for the great Stalin, and the audience applauded for a long time, eventually turning into a wave of cheers.
	Coal Industry Minister Zasyadko spoke next. He pointed out that the new Five-Year Plan vividly illustrates the great vitality of the Soviet social and state system, the powerful and invincible force of socialism, and the struggle of our people for peace. Under the Fifth Five-Year Plan, our country will take a major step in the transition from socialism to communism.
	Zasyadko said that due to the victorious completion of the post-war plan, Soviet coal production is now 84% higher than the pre-war level. Along with the increase in coal production, labor productivity is also constantly increasing. In the post-war years, the coal mining industry has re-equipped its equipment and obtained many new machines with high efficiency, mechanizing many basic coal mining operations, and is now the most mechanized coal mining industry in the world. It owns coal loading machines, coal mining combines and many other machines, thereby freeing miners from strenuous labor.
	Due to the adoption of new technological equipment, it has become possible for a large number of mining faces and coal pits to work according to schedules, and to improve all basic technical and economic indicators.
	Zasyadko described in detail the tasks facing coal miners under the new Five-Year Plan. Coal production must increase by 43%. This increase is equal to more than three times the total coal production of Tsarist Russia in 1913. Many new fully mechanized mines and longwalls will produce coal, the scale of automation will be expanded, and the organization of production will be further improved. Miners will receive new housing with a living area of 7.5 million square meters.
	Zasyadko emphasized the great importance of the Donets Coal Region to the country's national economy. He said that he believes that the Congress's directives must especially emphasize the necessity of rapidly developing this coal region under the new Five-Year Plan. He assured the Congress that Soviet miners will gloriously complete the tasks assigned to them by the new Five-Year Plan, because this task is consistent with the vital interests of all our people.
	Next, Park Jung-ae, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, delivered a speech. A storm of sustained applause welcomed this glorious daughter of the Korean people, an outstanding peace fighter. The Congress expressed its deep sympathy to the heroic Korean people, who are resisting the Anglo-American aggressors, defending the freedom and independence of their motherland, and fighting for their just cause. Park Jung-ae expressed her heartfelt congratulations to the Congress and all the Soviet people on behalf of the Korean Workers' Party and all the working people of Korea. She emphasized the great significance of the 19th Party Congress for all progressive mankind, especially for the Korean people.
	She said: After suffering a severe military and political defeat in Korea, the U.S. imperialists used the most vicious methods of war—bacteriological weapons and chemical weapons. However, despite all the atrocities committed by the U.S. aggressors, the Korean people and their heroic army, under the leadership of the Workers' Party and their beloved leader Kim Il-sung, are fully determined to achieve the final victory over the hateful enemy.
	When Park Jung-ae presented a red flag donated by the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party to the Congress, the entire venue erupted in a storm of cheers. Batolichev, the chairman of the Congress who accepted the flag, wished the heroic Korean people victory in their struggle to defend the freedom and independence of their motherland. Cheers for the friendship between the Korean and Soviet people resounded, followed by a storm of applause. Everyone stood up.
	Amidst warm welcomes, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Valko Chervenkov, stepped onto the podium to express the heartfelt congratulations of the friendly Bulgarian Communists and all the Bulgarian people to the Congress.
	He conveyed the Bulgarian Communist Party's and all the Bulgarian people's heartfelt gratitude, love and loyalty to the fraternal Soviet people, the supremely wise and powerful Bolshevik Party, and the brilliant leader and teacher Comrade Stalin. The Bulgarian people will never forget that the glorious Russian soldiers have twice liberated them from the yoke of foreign enslavement.
	Valko Chervenkov then described the remarkable changes that have taken place in the lives of the working people of Bulgaria, who have steadily embarked on the road to building socialism. Bulgaria has completely changed its old face. Industry is developing rapidly, agriculture has undergone tremendous changes, poverty, unemployment and crises will no longer occur; national culture is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the unity of the working people led by the Communist Party is constantly strengthening and consolidating.
	He said that our people will never forget that the restoration and achievements our country has achieved in a very short period of time in laying the foundation of a socialist economy would be unimaginable without the Soviet Union, without the Soviet Union's constant, large-scale, selfless support and assistance.
	Valko Chervenkov shouted amidst stormy applause and cheers: Glory to the invincible Communist Party of the Soviet Union! Glory to Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin!
	Next, Smirnov, a representative from Gorky Oblast, spoke. He talked about the glorious and victorious path that the Party, under the wise leadership of the great Stalin, has taken from the 18th Party Congress to the 19th Party Congress. The unprecedented upsurge of the national economy, the improvement of production and technological capabilities, and the development of science and machinery have provided all the necessary prerequisites for completing the great tasks stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan.
	Gorky Oblast has become one of the largest industrial oblasts with a highly developed machine industry. According to the Fourth Five-Year Plan, it supplied the country with many various new types of machines, including new-style automobiles, various excavators, and powerful diesel-electric passenger ships. The achievements of Soviet science and industrial technology have been widely applied in various industrial enterprises, and the experience of production innovators has been widely adopted, so that the work of mechanizing strenuous operations is being carried out on a large scale. The construction of the huge Gorky Hydropower Station, which is to be started during the Fifth Five-Year Plan, is progressing smoothly.
	The timber industry is an important sector of the economy of Gorky Oblast. There are serious shortcomings in the organization of logging work, which have resulted in excessive non-productive expenditures and high timber costs. Smirnov suggested greatly reducing the number of timber procurement agencies.
	Smirnov then criticized the Soviet State Planning Committee for its insufficient planning in allocating raw materials to Gorky Oblast's industry.
	He concluded by saying that the Gorky Oblast Party organization has discussed and fully approved the directives on the Fifth Five-Year Plan. The Communists are fully determined to spare no effort to complete the great Stalin plan for building communism in the Soviet land.
	Railway Minister Beshchev said that the draft directives of the Party Congress on the Fifth Five-Year Plan put forward a program for further strengthening the economic strength of the Soviet state and further developing industry, agriculture and transportation.
	Beshchev described the development of the railway transportation industry. He said that the current volume of freight transported by railways nationwide is about 80% higher than the pre-war level. This is a testament to the Party's great organizational work and the strength of the socialist economy. The volume of transportation on the Omsk Trunk Line alone exceeds the volume of transportation of the entire British railway system.
	Railway factories have greatly expanded. Soviet industry has supplied the transportation industry with thousands of new locomotives and hundreds of thousands of carriages. Special heavy rails have been laid on the trunk lines with the most frequent freight transportation. Many sections have been electrified. The level of mechanization of cargo loading and unloading has exceeded 2.4 times the pre-war period. The cultural level and technology of railway workers have been improved.
	Beshchev admitted that in railway transportation work, as pointed out in Malenkov's report, there are still some serious shortcomings. The Ministry of Railways will take all necessary measures to eliminate these shortcomings.
	Beshchev continued: It is necessary to improve the geographical distribution of industrial enterprises—industrial centers must be made closer to the sources of raw materials and fuel to avoid long-distance transportation.
	Next, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, extended warm congratulations to the Congress. The delegates responded with sustained applause.
	Gheorghiu-Dej expressed his gratitude for the delegation's opportunity to attend this Congress of world historical significance and the great school of all Communist and Workers' Parties.
	He said that the working people of the Romanian People's Republic deeply love the Soviet Union, love the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and love the dearest friend of the Romanian people—the leader and teacher of the working people of the world—Comrade Stalin.
	Gheorghiu-Dej then said that the Romanian people are paying close attention to the historical documents of the CPSU (B) Central Committee regarding the 19th Party Congress and Comrade Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." Stalin's classic work and the documents on the Congress have been translated into Romanian and published in hundreds of thousands of copies.
	He continued, thanks to the assistance of the Soviet Union, the socialist construction of the Romanian people has entered a stage where they have begun to obtain the results of national industrialization, and they have been able to happily engage in free labor, to consolidate and develop their country with all their strength, and to improve the well-being of the people.
	Gheorghiu-Dej concluded his speech amidst the sustained applause of the entire audience, cheering for the great Soviet Union, for the unbreakable friendship and fraternal cooperation between the Romanian and Soviet peoples, for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and for the great leader of the working people of the world—Comrade Stalin.
	Ville Pessi, General Secretary of the Finnish Communist Party, extended greetings to the Congress on behalf of the Finnish Communist Party and the working people, and he was warmly welcomed by the delegates and guests. He said that for all communist parties in the world, Lenin's and Stalin's Party is a great model for realizing the theory of Marxism-Leninism. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have pointed out to all mankind the path to a more advanced society and have proved in practice the vitality of the socialist system and its superiority over the capitalist system.
	Pessi continued by saying that now, from their own experience, the Finnish working people see more clearly than ever before that the Finnish people can only achieve happiness and prosperity through friendly cooperation with the Soviet people. The strength of the Soviet Union is the foundation of the invincible strength of the entire great international camp of peace, democracy and socialism.
	The morning session ended here.
	The Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) continued its session in the afternoon of October 9th to discuss Saburov's report - "Directives of the Nineteenth Party Congress on the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union for 1951-1955 (the Fifth Five-Year Plan)".
	The meeting was chaired by Aristov, who gave the floor to Kutirev, a representative from Sverdlovsk Oblast.
	Kutirev said that the Soviet men and women are welcoming the Nineteenth Party Congress with the fervent belief in the correctness of the Party's policies. The tremendous achievements in all aspects of socialist construction specifically and clearly illustrate the strong creative enthusiasm and determination of our working people to strive for the victory of communism.
	Kutirev used the example of Sverdlovsk Oblast to illustrate the achievements made by the socialist country. The industrial output of this oblast has increased fourfold compared to the pre-war period. The development of the machinery manufacturing industry is particularly rapid, an industrial sector which was previously insignificant in the Urals. The industrial workers are uniting around the Communists, bravely and successfully resolving the most complex technical problems encountered in designing new machines, in order to, as Comrade Stalin taught us, constantly improve our socialist production on the basis of the highest degree of technology.
	Kutirev criticized the Academy of Sciences and the State Planning Committee.
	Kutirev finally assured the Congress that the working people of Sverdlovsk Oblast will exert all their strength to fight for the cause of the Lenin-Stalin Party, for the cause of communism.
	Minister of the Shipbuilding Industry, Malyshev, said that the draft directives of the Congress on the new Five-Year Plan have been fully approved by our people. Soviet men and women know that the Communist Party, armed with the basic economic law of socialism discovered and scientifically demonstrated by Comrade Stalin, is firmly and confidently leading the country towards the victory of communism. The completion of the new Five-Year Plan will make the Soviet Union even stronger.
	According to the new Five-Year Plan, the development of machinery manufacturing will be particularly rapid. Malyshev described in detail the remarkable achievements made by this important sector of the national economy. Machinery manufacturing has greatly developed in the Soviet Union and has transformed the Soviet Union from a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial country. In the past few years, hundreds of new machines with high production capacity have been designed, and as a result, it is no longer necessary to manufacture obsolete and inefficient machines, and the types of equipment manufactured have undergone fundamental changes. More than 340 types of new metal-cutting lathes for general purposes with high production capacity, and more than 1,000 types of combined lathes for special purposes are in production. In 1940, only 84 types of agricultural machines and tools were produced, and this number had increased to 222 in 1950. The output of metallurgical equipment, turbines, and electrical equipment has increased several times; automatic mobile excavators, coal cutting combines, automatic continuous production devices, and other complex machines are in production in order to reduce manual labor and increase productivity.
	Malyshev said that the rich experience accumulated by the employees of the machine industry allows us to say that they will gloriously complete the tasks stipulated by the Party and the government in the new Five-Year Plan.
	Minister of Cotton Growing of the USSR, Yusupov, spoke next. He said that Comrade Malenkov's report and the draft directives of the Nineteenth Party Congress on the Fifth Five-Year Plan clearly reflect the achievements made by the Soviet state and determine the main tasks of communist construction set by our Party.
	The new Five-Year Plan pays great attention to cotton growing, which has developed rapidly in recent years.
	By the end of the new Five-Year Plan, the harvest of raw cotton will increase by 55% to 65% in order to supply the textile and food industries with the necessary raw material resources.
	Yusupov emphasized that the government has taken all necessary measures to strengthen the cotton-growing collective farms, which now have sufficient funds to develop their public enterprises and continuously improve the material welfare of the collective farmers.
	Large-scale measures are now being taken to irrigate cotton fields. The cotton-growing states are receiving a steady stream of new-style machines, but these machines have not been fully utilized. He said that in the next few years, the main way to increase cotton production will be to increase the yield per unit area.
	When M.A. Suslov stepped onto the podium, the delegates gave him a warm welcome.
	Suslov said that the Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and Comrade Stalin's recent brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" have opened up a bright prospect for our country to move towards the victory of communism, and have once again demonstrated to the world the endless power and strength of the Soviet socialist social system, and its unquestionable superiority over the capitalist system. The Fifth Five-Year Plan has pre-planned another great upsurge of the Soviet national economy, and will constitute a new stage in the establishment of the material and technical basis of communism.
	Suslov further emphasized that, according to the theory of Marxist-Leninist classics, one of the main conditions for the complete victory of communism is to further improve the cultural level and political awareness of all Soviet people and the communist education of the working people.
	The so-called "theory of no contradictions" that is popular among some literary and art workers is completely wrong and violates Marxism-Leninism; it prevents us from actively fighting against the remnants and influence of bourgeois ideology and everything that hinders our progress.
	Suslov cited Stalin's famous saying that the struggle between the old and the new, the struggle between the dying and the newborn is the basis of development. He said that developing socialist culture and communist education for the working people means declaring war on reactionary bourgeois ideology, on idlers and those who steal social property, on bureaucrats and those who violate state discipline; it means declaring war on those who worship reactionary bourgeois culture and the capitalist way of life, on nationalistic and cosmopolitan distortions (these distortions endanger Soviet ideology and international friendship); it means declaring war on the tendency of indifference to politics and lack of ideological content in literary, artistic, and scientific works.
	Suslov also talked about mass education as a powerful tool for improving socialist culture and the communist cultivation of the working people. He pointed out that our country has victoriously completed Comrade Stalin's instructions at the Eighteenth Party Congress to make all workers and all farmers cultured and educated.
	Suslov said that Comrade Stalin justly criticized the shortcomings in the organization of the Party's propaganda work, and he pointed out that one of its main shortcomings is the lack of textbooks that can provide Communists with the basic necessary knowledge of Marxist-Leninist theory. Comrade Stalin proposed writing a basic tutorial on Marxism-Leninism for party members and probationary members. This kind of tutorial will be of great help to our cadres.
	Suslov then emphasized again that the ideological and political work of the Party organization must focus on the historic resolutions of the Nineteenth Party Congress, on Stalin's recent brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," and on mobilizing the working people to complete and overfulfill the Fifth Five-Year Plan.
	Kosygin took the floor amidst sustained applause.
	He said that Comrade Stalin's recent brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" pointed out to the Party and the Soviet people the path to the complete victory of communism in our country. Comrade Stalin taught us that the basic economic law of the development of our society is to use the method of continuously developing and improving socialist production on the basis of the highest technology to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society.
	The wise Stalinist policy guaranteed the vigorous development of our heavy industry and socialist agriculture, and on this basis—the comprehensive development of all light industry sectors—guaranteed the continuous increase in the production volume of consumer goods. Our country has established many large-scale textile, knitting, clothing, fur, footwear and leather enterprises with new-style machines. New industrial sectors manufacturing artificial fibers, blended fibers, leather substitutes, and other items are developing. Obsolete and inefficient equipment is being replaced by new-style lathes and combines. More than 170,000 new lathes and machines have been installed in light industry during the post-war period. All of this has made the production of fibers, footwear, knitwear and other items greatly exceed the pre-war level. This year, light industry production will increase by 43% compared to the pre-war level.
	Kosygin said that the situation in capitalist countries is completely different. There, due to the expansion of armaments, civilian industries have been greatly reduced and the production of consumer goods has declined. Take Britain as an example. Britain, which not long ago was the most developed country in the textile industry, controlling almost all major textile markets, saw its textile production in 1951 decrease by 40% compared to the pre-war period.
	Kosygin mostly talked about the issue of supplying raw materials to light industry in his speech. He raised many criticisms of the fact that the Ministry of Cotton Growing did not pay adequate attention to the work of the cotton ginning industry. In many states and republics, the work of developing flax cultivation has not been given attention.
	Kosygin said that the tasks of light industry stipulated in the new Five-Year Plan clearly reflect Stalin's concern for further improving the welfare of the Soviet people. The new Five-Year Plan stipulates a fundamental transformation of all sectors of light industry, which will be expanded at an average annual rate of approximately 11%. According to Comrade Stalin's instructions, during this five-year period, many new large textile industry centers will be established, especially in Kamyshin, Engels, Barnaul, Krasnodar, Kherson and Stalinabad.
	Kosygin said that the personnel in light industry are working with great enthusiasm to implement Stalin's plan to manufacture abundant consumer goods in our country and will excellently complete the tasks stipulated by the great leader.
	Minister of Power Stations, Zhmerin, spoke next. He said that the draft directives on the new Five-Year Plan reflect the huge scale of Soviet socialist construction. Lenin and Stalin taught us that it is only possible to victoriously build communism on the basis of advanced technology and on the basis of the complete electrification of the country. In order to implement this instruction, the Soviet government has taken all measures to strengthen and further develop our country's power system. The Soviet Union has already greatly surpassed all capitalist countries in Europe in power production. In 1951, power production was more than twice that of the pre-war year 1940.
	The new Five-Year Plan requires the further development of electrification to a considerable extent. The generating capacity of power plants will approximately double, and the amount of electricity generated will increase by 80%.
	Due to Comrade Stalin's initiative, the construction of the world's largest hydroelectric power projects is underway on the Volga River, the Dnieper River, and the Amu Darya River. The first parts of these projects, the Volga-Don Canal and the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Station, have been opened to navigation and are generating electricity. The smooth progress of the construction makes us confident that the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station will definitely be completed in 1955, and the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station will definitely be completed one year ahead of schedule. The basic investment put into hydroelectric power stations is increasing year by year.
	At the same time, Zhmerin pointed out that there are still many shortcomings in the construction of some power plants, and he admitted that the criticisms made of the Power Station Department he leads are correct.
	Minister of the Iron and Steel Industry, Tevosyan, talked in detail about the development of the ferrous and non-ferrous metal industries. The current production of rolled metal has increased by more than double compared to the pre-war level. Metal production has increased, and dozens of new types of steel and rolled metal are now being produced.
	The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates the further vigorous development of the ferrous and non-ferrous metal industries. This development is closely linked to the further improvement of technology and the large-scale automation of production. The construction of magnificent hydroelectric power stations has opened up broad prospects for the electrification of the production process. The draft directives stipulate a much greater increase in investment in the ferrous and non-ferrous metal industries than in the previous Five-Year Plan.
	Tevosyan emphasized the need to tap internal potential in every possible way; he also discussed the issue of training personnel.
	He said that the achievements made by the socialist countries are making the working people of the capitalist countries increasingly believe that the best path to realize the hopes of mankind for many years and to strive for world peace and a happy life is the path taken by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin. (Applause) The fundamental change in the balance of power in favor of socialism should be attributed to the genius leader of the proletarian revolution, the great successor to Lenin's cause—Comrade Stalin. (A storm of sustained applause)
	The discussion on Saburov's report ended here. The Congress accepted the draft "Directives of the Nineteenth Party Congress on the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union for 1951-1955 (the Fifth Five-Year Plan)" drafted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) as a basis, and elected a committee to study revisions and supplements to the draft directives.
	Near the end of the afternoon session, the representatives of foreign Communist and Workers' Parties, who were warmly welcomed by the Congress, read out congratulatory messages and delivered speeches.
	A congratulatory telegram signed by Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, was read out at the meeting.
	The telegram said: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union—the Party of Lenin and Stalin—is an example and source of inspiration for communist parties and all progressive mankind in all countries. Its achievements in theory and practice, its unwavering advocacy of proletarian internationalism, its achievements in building socialism and gradually transitioning to communism, and its great struggle for international peace and friendship have, in the past and present, pointed out the path for mankind to seek liberation from oppression and exploitation. One-third of the people in the world—including the people of our great neighbor, People's China—have steadily embarked on this path.
	A congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party was read out at the meeting. The members of the Workers' Party and the people of Vietnam extend warm congratulations to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks).
	The telegram said: At a time when the struggle to win world peace is unfolding and involving hundreds of millions of people around the world, the news of the convening of this Congress has evoked great enthusiasm among the Vietnamese people—as among the people of the world—because the Vietnamese people regard this Congress as a new source of hope and light, which will clearly point out to the Vietnamese people the path of struggle for independence, democracy and peace. After the congratulatory message was read out, the venue erupted in applause.
	Next, Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, delivered a congratulatory message. The delegates warmly welcomed the representative of the heroic Albanian people. He spoke with deep emotion about the great Stalin, the Bolshevik Party and the powerful Soviet people. He said that the people of all countries wholeheartedly admire and love the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin. No matter where they are, no matter how far or near they are from Moscow, no matter how many or few they are, their hearts are with Moscow, with the great Stalin, and inspired by his name, a broad road leading to socialism, to communism, to light, to peace is being built.
	The glorious mother of our communist and workers' parties, the great Party of Lenin and Stalin, is nurturing us, and its great experience is teaching and arming our Party, so that our Party can fight to complete the tasks entrusted to it by the people.
	Hoxha told the Congress how the small Albanian people, surrounded on all sides by hostile forces, are living a life of freedom and independence and building socialism.
	His moving speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause. He concluded his speech with the following words:
	Glory to the great Soviet Union—the unbreakable bastion of freedom, democracy and peace, the glorious homeland of socialism and communism!
	May the savior of our people and all mankind, the great beloved leader Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, live forever!
	(A storm of sustained applause and cheers)
	Damdin Sükhbaatar, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, read out a congratulatory letter amidst the warm welcome of the entire audience. The letter said that the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party has always regarded the Bolshevik Party as its guide and has always taken the heroic struggle of the Bolshevik Party as an example for itself to learn from, and has always received invaluable and enormous assistance from the Bolshevik Party and Comrade Stalin in strengthening its ranks and combat effectiveness in the struggle to safeguard the interests of the Mongolian working people.
	Sharkey, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Australian Communist Party, then took the stage to offer congratulations.
	He said that he listened intently to the speech describing the achievements of Soviet agriculture. These achievements are in stark contrast to the agricultural situation in Australia. The predatory exploitation of the land by capitalism and the destruction caused by floods and droughts, which are not prevented or controlled at all, have put Australia's eight million people in a situation where they do not have enough to eat. This is what capitalism is like. In concluding his speech, Sharkey cheered for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin.
	Next, a congratulatory telegram from Prestes, General Secretary of the Brazilian Communist Party, was read out at the meeting.
	Prestes said in his telegram: The Soviet people are advancing along the path of peaceful construction and are victoriously implementing the great Stalin plan that will bring them peace, happiness and prosperity. The Brazilian people are watching the achievements of the Soviet people with respect and love.
	We know that every step the Soviet Union takes on the road to communism is a step forward in the struggle of all peoples for peace, democracy and socialism.
	The delegates warmly welcomed Codovilla, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Argentina, who delivered a speech. He expressed the feelings of the working class and all the people of Argentina who love peace and democracy, and extended heartfelt congratulations to this historic Congress and its delegates. He said that the sympathy of the people of Latin American countries for the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries is constantly growing.

    苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会第五日会议
    结束关于新五年计划指示草案的讨论
    大会接受新五年计划的指示草案作为基础并选出一个委员会来研究指示草案的修正和补充
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日电：苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会十月九日上午会议继续讨论马·萨·萨布罗夫所作的第十九次党代表大会关于一九五一年—一九五五年苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示的报告。所有发言人都一致指出：新五年计划是向共产主义迈进了一大步，苏联人民认定实施这个伟大计划与他们有切身关系，将尽力完成并超额完成这个计划。代表大会的代表们着重指出：新五年计划的目的是加强苏维埃国家力量和提高苏维埃人民的生活水平，同时它对于加强国际和平、民主与社会主义阵营的事业也是巨大的贡献。
    这次会议由巴托里切夫同志担任主席。
    莫斯科代表雅斯诺夫同志首先发言，他说：代表大会关于新五年计划的指示草案，为正在满怀信心地向着共产主义前进的苏维埃国家，制定了进一步发展国民经济和文化的纲领。
    雅斯诺夫同志接着报告莫斯科市发展的远景。政府已根据斯大林同志的指示，拟就了和批准了在一九五一—一九六零年重建首都的总计划。计划规定进一步改进莫斯科市。根据计划，十年内要在莫斯科修建面积达一千万平方公尺的房屋。莫斯科在第五个五年计划期间修建的房屋，必须三倍于第四个五年计划期间修建的房屋。学校、医疗机关和电影院的数目将要增加，市内交通和公用事业将要进一步发展。
    长达二十公里左右的地下铁道大环行线的修建工程将于明年完成。计划中也规定增加首都的瓦斯供应。
    莫斯科的摩天大楼的修建，标志着社会主义城市发展的一个新阶段，并证明了苏维埃建筑学水平之高和我们的建筑工业的发展。这些摩天大楼根本改变首都的全貌。
    雅斯诺夫接着谈到关于组织建设工作和降低建设费用的许多问题。这些问题的正确解决对于代表大会的指示草案中所规定的伟大建设工作具有特别重要的意义。
    雅斯诺夫说，我们知道党和政府交付给我们的完成改建首都的宏伟计划的责任。莫斯科党组织和莫斯科的全体居民将忠实地完成这个任务。
    当约·维·斯大林的战友之一米高扬在讲台上出现时，会场上响起了暴风雨般经久不息的掌声。
    米高扬说，党中央委员会的报告、党中央委员会为党代表大会起草的文件以及新近发表的斯大林同志关于社会主义经济问题的天才著作，用斯大林的天才的光芒照亮了已经走过的道路以及通往轮廓日益清晰的共产主义社会的道路。
    米高扬同志说，当我们的强大的党召开第十九次代表大会之际，我们应该向教育我们、组织我们、领导我们通过各种困难和考验、而且现正领导着我们走向共产主义的完全胜利的人致敬，也就是向天才的人、共产主义的伟大建筑师斯大林致敬。当他说这几句话时，听众报以热烈的鼓掌。
    米高扬的发言大部分是报告消费品工业的工作。他指出，苏联食品工业发展的显著特点是肉类、奶类、鱼类产品以及水果、糖等这些最有价值的物品的产量迅速增加，以满足居民一天天增加的需要。在美国，一九五一年的肉类产量比一九四六年减少了四十三万七千吨，而苏联在同一时期的肉类产量则增加了七十万零九千吨。
    米高扬接着谈到在新五年计划中屠宰业、鱼业、炼糖业以及其他工业发展的广阔远景。
    米高扬谈到零售贸易商品销售额比一九四八年增加一倍多，他指出，最近几年来汽车、机器脚踏车、自行车、收音机、电视机、家具、冰箱、乐器等的销售量的增加，生动地反映了苏联人民物质福利的提高。居民福利不断提高和他们相信苏维埃货币的另一个鲜明事实是，一九五二年居民在储蓄银行的存款比一九四○年增加三倍。由于最近五年以来物价不断降低，消费品价格的水平普遍降低百分之五十。
    米高扬引证数字，说明在资本主义国家一方面食品价格不断上涨，一方面垄断资本家为了追求超额利润执行着提高价格、降低工资的政策。
    米高扬发言的结束部分是谈苏联的对外贸易。他指出，苏联对外贸易的数量现在已为战前时期的三倍。对民主阵营国家的贸易现在占对外贸易的大部分。民主阵营——这一新的世界市场——各国间的经济合作，正在这些国家的经济有计划的发展和各国互相间的经济计划密切配合的稳固基础上展开着；这种经济合作是在大小国家一律平等、尊重相互利益和在经济发展方面互相援助的基础上建立的。
    米高扬在结束他的发言时，为伟大的斯大林欢呼，全场掌声经久不息，最后变成一片欢呼。
    煤业部长札霞迪科继起发言，他指出，新五年计划生动地说明苏维埃社会与国家制度具有伟大的生命力，社会主义具有强大的不可战胜的力量，我国人民在为和平而奋斗。在第五个五年计划下，我们国家将在由社会主义到共产主义的过渡中迈进一大步。
    札霞迪科说，由于战后计划的胜利完成，苏联煤产量现在已比战前水平提高百分之八十四。与煤产量的增加同时，劳动生产率也不断地提高。在战后年代中，采煤工业改装了设备，得到了许多具有高度效率的新机器，使许多基本采煤操作机械化，现在已是世界上最机械化的采煤工业。它拥有装煤机、采煤联合机及许多其他机械，从而免除了矿工的费力劳动。
    由于采用了新技术设备，就有可能使大批采掘面和煤坑按照进程表工作，并改进一切基本技术——经济指数。
    札霞迪科详细叙述了煤矿工人在新五年计划下面临的任务。煤产量必须增加百分之四十三。这一增加等于沙皇俄国在一九一三年全部煤产量的三倍多。许多新的完全机械化的矿场和长壁将要出煤，自动化的规模将要扩大，生产组织将进一步改进。矿工将得到居住面积达七百五十万平方公尺的新房屋。
    札霞迪科强调顿尼兹煤区对于国家的国民经济的巨大重要性，他说，他认为代表大会的指示必须特别强调在新五年计划下迅速发展这个煤区的必要性。他向大会保证：苏联矿工们将光荣地完成新五年计划给他们规定的任务，因为这个任务是和我国全体人民的切身利益一致的。
    接着由朝鲜劳动党中央委员会书记朴正爱致词。暴风雨般经久不息的掌声欢迎这个朝鲜人民的光荣的女儿、杰出的和平战士。大会以此对正在抵抗英美侵略者、保卫他们祖国的自由和独立、为他们的正义事业而斗争的英雄的朝鲜人民，表达深切的同情。朴正爱向大会和全体苏联人民表达朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜全体劳动人民的衷心的贺意。她强调指出第十九次党代表大会对全体进步人类特别是对于朝鲜人民的巨大意义。
    她说：美帝国主义者在朝鲜遭受到严重的军事与政治失败之后，就使用了最恶毒的战争方法——细菌武器与化学武器。但是，尽管美国侵略者采取了种种的暴行，在劳动党和敬爱的领袖金日成领导下的朝鲜人民和他们的英雄的军队，完全有决心取得对可恨的敌人的最后胜利。
    当朴正爱把朝鲜劳动党中央委员会赠送的一面红旗献给大会的时候，全场响起了一阵暴风雨般的欢呼。代表大会接受献旗的主席巴托里切夫祝英雄的朝鲜人民在他们保卫祖国自由与独立的斗争中获得胜利。祝朝鲜与苏联人民友好的欢呼声四起，继之以暴风雨般掌声。全体起立。
    保加利亚共产党中央委员会总书记维尔科·契尔文科夫，在热烈的欢迎中，走上讲台向大会表达友好的保加利亚的共产党人和全体人民的衷心的贺意。
    他转达了保加利亚共产党和保加利亚全体人民对于兄弟苏维埃人民、十分英明强大的布尔什维克党、天才的领袖和导师斯大林同志的衷心感谢、爱戴和忠诚。保加利亚人民决不会忘记光荣的俄罗斯战士曾经两次把他们从外国奴役的枷锁下解放出来。
    维尔科·契尔文科夫接着叙述已稳步走上建设社会主义道路的保加利亚劳动人民的生活中所发生的显著变化。保加利亚已完全改变了旧日的面貌，工业正在迅速发展，农业发生了巨大的变化，贫困、失业和危机已不再会发生了；民族文化日益昌盛，由共产党所领导的劳动人民的团结正在不断加强和巩固。
    他说，我国人民决不会忘记：我国在很短的时间内在奠定社会主义经济基础方面获得的复兴和成就，如果没有苏联，没有苏联经常的、大量的、无私的支持和援助，那是不可想像的。
    维尔科·契尔文科夫在暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼中高呼：光荣归于无往不胜的苏联共产党！光荣归于约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林！
    接着由高尔基州代表斯米尔诺夫发言，他谈到党在伟大的斯大林的英明领导下在第十八次代表大会到第十九次代表大会期间所走过的光辉胜利的道路。国民经济的空前高涨，生产—技术能力的提高、科学和机械的发达已为完成第五个五年计划所规定的伟大任务提供了一切必要的先决条件。
    高尔基州已经变成了拥有高度发达的机器工业的最大的工业州之一。根据第四个五年计划，它供给了国家许多各种各样的新型机器，其中包括新式的汽车，各种挖掘机和马力强大的柴油电气客轮。苏联科学和工业技术的成就在各工业企业中被广泛地应用，生产革新者的经验被广泛地采用，使费力操作机械化的工作正在大规模进行。要在第五个五年计划期间开工的巨大的高尔基水电站的修建工作正在顺利地进行着。
    木材工业是高尔基州经济的一个重要部门。在伐木的组织工作中存在着严重的缺点，这些缺点造成了非生产开支过大和木材成本过高的现象。斯米尔诺夫建议大大减少木材采购机构的数目。
    斯米尔诺夫接着批评苏联国家计划委员会在分配原料给高尔基州工业的工作中计划性不够。
    他最后说，高尔基州党组织已经讨论了并且完全赞成关于第五个五年计划的指示。共产党员都有充分决心不遗余力地完成关于在苏维埃国度建设共产主义的伟大的斯大林计划。
    铁道部长别什切夫说，党代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示草案提出了一个进一步加强苏维埃国家的经济力量、进一步发展工业、农业和运输业的纲领。
    别什切夫叙述铁路运输业的发展情况，他说，目前全国铁路的货运量约超过战前水平百分之八十，这是党的巨大的组织工作和社会主义经济力量的一个证明。单是鄂木斯克干线运输量就超过英国全国铁路的运输量。
    铁路工厂已大大扩大了。苏联工业给运输业供应了几千辆新的机车和几十万个车厢。在货运最频繁的干线上已铺了特别的重轨。许多路段已经电气化。货物装卸机械化的水平已超过战前时期两点四倍。铁路工人的文化水平和技术都已提高。
    别什切夫承认在铁路运输工作中，正如马林科夫的报告所指出的，仍然存在着一些严重的缺点。铁道部将采取一切必要的措施来消灭这些缺点。
    别什切夫继称：必须改进工业企业的地理分布情况——必须使工业中心更接近于原料和燃料的来源地以免长距离的运输。
    接着罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会总书记乔治乌—德治向大会致热烈的祝贺。代表们报以经久不息的鼓掌。
    乔治乌—德治对于代表团获得机会列席这个具有世界历史重要意义的和所有共产党与工人党的伟大学校的代表大会，表示感谢。
    他说，罗马尼亚人民共和国劳动人民深深地热爱苏联，热爱光荣的苏联共产党，热爱罗马尼亚人民最亲爱的朋友——全世界劳动人民的领袖与导师——斯大林同志。
    乔治乌—德治接着说，罗马尼亚人民都深切地注意联共（布）中央委员会关于第十九次党代表大会的历史性文件和斯大林同志的辉煌著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。斯大林的这部经典著作和关于代表大会的文件都已译成了罗马尼亚文，出版了几十万本。
    他继续说，由于苏联的援助，罗马尼亚人民的社会主义建设已经进入这样的阶段：他们已开始得到国家工业化的成果，他们已能够愉快地从事自由的劳动，以他们的全部力量来巩固和发展他们的国家，来提高人民的福利。
    乔治乌—德治在全场经久不息的掌声中结束他的发言时，为伟大的苏联，为罗马尼亚人民与苏联人民之间的牢不可破的友谊和兄弟合作，为苏联共产党，为世界劳动人民的伟大领袖——斯大林同志欢呼。
    芬兰共产党总书记威利·贝西代表芬兰共产党和劳动人民向大会致贺，他受到代表们和来宾们的热烈欢迎。他说，对于世界上所有的共产党来说，列宁、斯大林的党是实现马克思—列宁主义学说的伟大典范。在共产党的领导下，苏联人民向全人类指出了走向一个更高级的社会的道路，并在实践中证明了社会主义制度的活力及其对资本主义制度的优越性。
    贝西接着说，现在，芬兰劳动人民从他们亲身的体验中比以前任何时候都更清楚地看出，芬兰人民只有与苏联人民友好合作才能得到幸福和繁荣。苏联的力量是整个伟大的国际和平、民主和社会主义阵营的不可战胜的力量的基础。
    上午会议至此结束。
    苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会在十月九日下午继续举行会议，讨论萨布罗夫的报告——“第十九次党代表大会关于一九五一年—一九五五年苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示”。
    会议由阿里斯托夫任主席，他让斯维德洛夫斯克州代表库蒂列夫发言。
    库蒂列夫说，苏维埃男女怀着热诚相信党的政策之正确性的心情，来迎接第十九次党代表大会。社会主义建设各方面的巨大成就，具体而明白地说明了我国劳动人民为共产主义的胜利而奋斗的强大创造热情和决心。
    库蒂列夫用斯维德洛夫斯克州的例子来说明社会主义国家所取得的成就。这个州的工业产量已增加到战前的四倍。机器制造业的发展特别迅速，这一部门工业以前在乌拉尔是微不足道的。工业工人正团结在共产党员周围，勇敢地、顺利地解决在设计新机器方面所遇到的最复杂的技术问题，以便如斯大林同志所教导我们的，在最高度技术基础上不断地使我们的社会主义生产趋于完善。
    库蒂列夫批评了科学院和国家计划委员会。
    库蒂列夫最后向大会提出保证说：斯维德洛夫斯克州的劳动人民将发挥一切力量为列宁—斯大林党的事业、为共产主义的事业而奋斗。
    造船工业部部长马利雪夫说，大会关于新五年计划的指示草案已为我国人民所完全批准。苏维埃男女知道，用斯大林同志所发现和给予科学论证的社会主义基本经济法则武装起来的共产党，正在坚定地和满怀信心地领导全国向共产主义的胜利迈进。新五年计划的完成，将使苏联更加强大。
    根据新五年计划，机器制造业的发展将特别迅速。马利雪夫详细叙述了国民经济的这个重要部门所获得的显著成就。机器制造业在苏联已大大发展，并使苏联从一个落后的农业国变为一个强大的工业国。在过去数年中，有数以百计的具有高度生产能力的新机器设计出来，结果就可以不再制造过时的效率低微的机器，并使所制造的装备的类型有了根本的变化。三百四十种以上有高度生产能力的用于一般用途的新式金属切削车床，及一千多种用于特殊用途的联合车床已在生产中。一九四零年只生产了八十四种农业机器和工具，这个数字在一九五零年已增为二百二十二种了。冶金装备、透平和电气装备的产量增加了数倍；自动移动挖掘机、截煤联合机、自动连续生产装置及其他复杂机器已在生产中，以便减轻人力劳动，并提高生产率。
    马利雪夫说，机器工业职工积累的丰富经验使我们可以说，他们将光荣地完成党和政府在新五年计划中所规定的任务。
    苏联植棉部部长尤苏波夫继起发言。他说，马林科夫同志的报告和第十九次党代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示草案清楚地反映了苏维埃国家获得的成就，并决定了我们的党规定的共产主义建设的主要任务。
    新五年计划中极其注意近来迅速发展起来的植棉工作。
    到新五年计划结束时，原棉的收成将增加百分之五十五至六十五，以便供给纺织和食品工业以必要的原料资源。
    尤苏波夫着重指出，政府采取了一切必要的措施以加强植棉集体农庄，这些农庄现在拥有足够的资金，可用来发展它们的公共企业和不断提高集体农民的物质福利。
    现在在采取大规模的措施来灌溉棉田。植棉的各州正得到源源不绝的新式机器，但是这些机器尚未得到充分的利用。他说，在以后几年中，主要要用提高单位面积产量的方法来增加棉花产量。
    当米·安·苏斯洛夫走上讲台时，代表们予以热烈的欢迎。
    苏斯洛夫说，苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会和斯大林同志最近的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”给我国展开了向共产主义胜利迈进的光辉前景，向全世界再度表示了苏维埃社会主义社会制度的无穷无尽的力量与威力，并表示了它对于资本主义制度的无可置疑的优越性。第五个五年计划预定了苏联国民经济的另一个巨大高涨，并将构成建立共产主义的物质—技术基础的一个新阶段。
    苏斯洛夫进一步强调指出，根据马克思—列宁主义经典著作的学说，共产主义完全胜利的主要条件之一是进一步提高所有苏维埃人民的文化水平与政治觉悟以及劳动人民的共产主义教育。
    在某些文艺工作者中间流行的所谓“没有矛盾的理论”，是完全错误的，并且是违反马克思—列宁主义的；它使我们不能对资产阶级思想的残余和影响、对阻挡我们前进的一切东西进行积极的斗争。
    苏斯洛夫引证了斯大林关于旧事物与新事物之间的斗争、垂死的事物与新生的事物之间的斗争是发展的基础这一名言。他说，发展社会主义文化和对劳动人民的共产主义教育，就是对反动的资产阶级思想，对懒汉和盗窃社会财产的人，对官僚主义者和违反国家纪律者宣战；就是对崇拜资产阶级反动文化及资本主义生活方式的人，对民族主义的和世界主义的歪曲（这些歪曲危害着苏维埃思想和国际友谊）宣战；就是对文学、艺术与科学作品中不关心政治的倾向和缺乏思想内容的作品宣战。
    苏斯洛夫又谈到群众教育是提高社会主义文化和劳动人民共产主义修养的一个有力的工具。他指出，我国胜利地完成了斯大林同志在第十八次党代表大会上所提出的关于使一切工人和一切农民成为有文化和有教养的人的指示。
    苏斯洛夫说，斯大林同志公正地批评了党的宣传工作组织方面的缺点，他指出它的主要缺点之一是缺乏可使共产党员得到关于马克思—列宁主义理论起码的必要知识的教科书。斯大林同志提议为党员和候补党员写一本马克思—列宁主义的初级教程。这种教程对于我们干部将有巨大的帮助。
    苏斯洛夫接着又着重指出：党组织的思想—政治工作必须集中在第十九次党代表大会的历史性决议上，集中在斯大林最近的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”上，以及动员劳动人民完成和超额完成第五个五年计划上。
    柯西金在经久不息的掌声中继起发言。
    他说，斯大林同志最近的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”向党和苏联人民指出了共产主义在我国完全胜利的道路。斯大林同志教导我们：我们社会的发展的基本经济法则是用在最高技术的基础上不断发展和改进社会主义生产的方法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    英明的斯大林政策保证了我国重工业和社会主义农业的强有力的发展，并且在这个基础上——一切轻工业部门的全面发展的基础上，保证了消费品生产量的不断增加。我国已经建立了许多规模宏大的拥有新式机器的纺织品、针织品、衣服、毛皮、鞋靴和皮革等企业。制造人造纤维、混合纤维、皮革代用品等物品的新工业部门正在发展着。过时的效率不大的装备正被新式的车床和联合机代替。战后期间在轻工业中安置了十七万多架新的车床和机器。所有这一切已使纤维、鞋靴、针织品及其他物品的生产大大超过战前水平。今年轻工业生产将比战前水平提高百分之四十三。
    柯西金说：在资本主义国家，情形就完全不同了，在那里，由于扩张军备，民用工业大大减缩，消费品生产下降了。就以英国为例吧，英国不久以前还是纺织业最发达的国家，几乎控制了所有主要的纺织品市场，可是在一九五一年纺织品的产额竟比战前减少了百分之四十。
    柯西金在发言中大部分谈论关于供应轻工业原料的问题。他对于植棉部没有适当注意轧棉工业工作一点，提出了许多批评。在许多州和共和国中，发展种植亚麻的工作没有受到重视。
    柯西金说，新五年计划中规定的轻工业的任务清楚地反映了斯大林对进一步提高苏维埃人民福利的关怀。新五年计划规定根本改造轻工业各部门，轻工业将以每年平均增加大约百分之十一的速率加以扩充。根据斯大林同志的指示，在这个五年期间，许多新的大纺织业中心将建立起来，特别是在卡米新、恩格斯、巴尔瑙尔、克拉斯诺达、刻松和斯大林纳巴德。
    柯西金说：轻工业方面的人员正以巨大的热情，努力执行在我国制造丰足的消费品的斯大林计划，而且将要出色地完成伟大领袖所规定的任务。
    电站部部长日梅林接着发言。他说：关于新五年计划的指示草案反映了苏联社会主义建设的巨大规模。列宁和斯大林教导我们说：在优越技术的基础上，在国家全部电气化的基础上，才可能胜利地建设共产主义。苏维埃政府为了执行这个指示，采取了一切措施，加强并进一步发展我国的电力系统。苏联在电力生产上已经大大地超过了欧洲的一切资本主义国家。在一九五一年，电力产量为战前一九四○年的两倍多。
    新五年计划要求在相当的程度上进一步发展电气化。电力厂的发电能力大约将增加一倍，发电量将增加百分之八十。
    由于斯大林同志的倡议，世界上最大的水力发电工程的建设正在伏尔加河、第聂伯河和阿姆·达里亚河上进行着。这些工程的第一部分伏尔加河—顿河运河和齐姆良水力发电站已经通航和发电。建设的顺利进展使得我们深信，古比雪夫水力发电站一定可以在一九五五年完成，卡霍夫卡水电站一定可以提前一年完成。投入水力发电站的基本投资一年比一年增加。
    同时，日梅林指出，在一些发电厂的建设中，仍然存在着许多缺点，他并且承认对他所领导的电站部所提的批评是正确的。
    钢铁工业部部长提伏希安详细谈到黑色金属和有色金属工业的发展。现在压延金属的产量比战前的水平增加一倍以上。金属生产增加了，现在已在生产数十种新种类的钢和压延金属。
    第五个五年计划规定进一步大力发展黑色和有色金属工业。这种发展是和技术的进一步改进，是和生产的大规模自动化密切联系着的。宏大的水电站的兴建为生产过程的电气化开辟了广阔的前景。指示草案规定比前一个五年计划大大增加对黑色金属和有色金属工业的投资。
    提伏希安着重指出必须以一切可能的办法发掘内在潜力；他并论及训练人员的问题。
    他说，社会主义国家获得的成就，使资本主义国家的劳动人民日益相信：实现人类多少年来的希望，争取世界和平和幸福的生活的最好的道路，是苏联人民在列宁、斯大林的党领导下所走的道路。（掌声）力量对比的发生有利于社会主义的基本变化，要归功于无产阶级革命的天才领袖、列宁事业的伟大继承者——斯大林同志。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）
    关于萨布罗夫报告的讨论至此结束。大会接受苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会起草的“第十九次党代表大会关于一九五一年—一九五五年苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示”草案作为基础，并选出一个委员会来研究指示草案的修正和补充。
    在下午会议快要结束的时候，受到代表大会热烈欢迎的外国共产党和工人党的代表们宣读了贺词并发表演说。
    会上宣读了印度共产党总书记阿约艾·高士所签署的贺电。
    贺电说：苏联共产党——列宁和斯大林的党是鼓舞各国共产党和全体进步人类的榜样和源泉。它在理论和实践方面的成就，它对于无产阶级国际主义的始终不渝的拥护，它在建设社会主义和逐渐过渡到共产主义方面的成就，它为国际和平与友谊所作的伟大斗争，在过去和现在都指明了人类能从压迫和剥削下求得解放的道路。世界上三分之一的人民——其中包括我们的伟大邻国、人民中国的人民——已经稳步走上了这条道路。
    会议上宣读了越南劳动党中央委员会的贺电。劳动党党员和越南人民向苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会致以热烈的祝贺。
    贺电中说：在争取世界和平的斗争正在展开并且使全世界数亿人民都参加进来的时候，在共产主义建设正在苏联加速进行的时候，召开这次代表大会的消息在越南人民中——正如在全世界人民中一样——唤起了极大的热情，因为越南人民把这次代表大会当作新的希望和光亮的源泉，这个光亮将为越南人民清楚地指出争取独立、民主与和平的斗争的道路。贺词宣读后，会场上响起了一片掌声。
    接着阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会总书记霍查致贺词。代表们热烈欢迎英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民的代表。他以深刻的感情谈到伟大的斯大林、布尔什维克党和强大的苏联人民，他说，世界各国人民都全心全意地钦仰和热爱苏联和斯大林同志。不管他们在什么地方，不管他们离莫斯科是远还是近，不管他们的人数是多还是少，他们的心是与莫斯科在一起的，是与伟大的斯大林在一起的，在他的名字的鼓舞下，一条通往社会主义，通往共产主义，通往光明，通往和平的宽阔的大道正在建筑中。
    我们共产党和工人党的光荣的母亲、伟大的列宁、斯大林的党正在培育我们，它的伟大的经验正在教导和武装着我们的党，以便我们的党为完成人民所交付的任务而进行斗争。
    霍查告诉代表大会，四面八方被敌对势力所包围的、人数很少的阿尔巴尼亚人民，是如何过着自由和独立的生活和建设社会主义的。
    他的动人的演说一再为掌声所打断，他以下面的话结束了他的演说：
    光荣归于伟大的苏联——自由、民主与和平的牢不可破的堡垒，社会主义与共产主义的光荣祖国！
    祝我国人民和全体人类的救星、伟大的敬爱的领袖约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林万寿无疆！
    （暴风雨般经久不息的掌声和欢呼声）
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会书记达姆巴在全场的热烈欢迎下，宣读了一封贺信。贺信说，蒙古人民革命党始终都认为布尔什维克党是自己的带路人，过去和现在始终都把布尔什维克党的英勇斗争当做自己学习的榜样，而过去和现在也始终都得到布尔什维克党和斯大林同志给予它在维护蒙古劳动人民利益的斗争中加强自己的队伍和战斗力的无可估价的巨大援助。
    澳大利亚共产党中央委员会总书记夏基接着登台致贺。
    他说，他聚精会神地倾听了叙述苏联农业成就的发言。这些成就与澳大利亚的农业状况恰成鲜明的对比。资本主义对土地的掠夺式的利用和丝毫没有加以防治的水旱灾所造成的破坏，已使澳大利亚八百万人民处在没有足够粮食吃的境地。资本主义就是这样。夏基在结束他的发言时为苏联共产党和斯大林同志欢呼。
    接着，在会上宣读了巴西共产党总书记普列斯特斯的贺电。
    普列斯特斯在他的贺电中说：苏联人民正在沿着和平建设的道路前进，而且正在胜利地实现将为他们带来和平、幸福与繁荣的伟大的斯大林计划。巴西人民怀着尊敬与热爱的心情注视着苏联人民的成就。
    我们知道，苏联在走向共产主义的道路上每走一步也就是所有各族人民争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争前进了一步。
    代表们热烈欢迎阿根廷共产党中央委员会书记柯都维亚致词。他表达阿根廷爱好和平与民主的工人阶级与全体人民的心情，衷心地向这个历史性的大会及其代表们祝贺。他说：拉丁美洲各国人民对于苏联和其他爱好和平国家的同情正在不断地增长。
    比利时共产党总书记拉尔曼接着致词。他说：
    我们对于能够出席你们的意义重大的代表大会，感到幸福和骄傲。这次代表大会更加强了我们对于我们共同事业的正义性的信心，使我们更相信社会主义一定要在各国胜利。（掌声）
    我们感谢你们使我们有机会在这个讲台上表示我们对于我们伟大的和敬爱的约瑟夫·斯大林同志的无限感谢和尊敬，我国普通人民都认为他是被压迫者的最可靠的朋友，是和平的保卫者，是弱小民族的最好的保护人。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声。全体起立）
    代表大会下午会议至此结束。下一次会议将于十月十日举行。
