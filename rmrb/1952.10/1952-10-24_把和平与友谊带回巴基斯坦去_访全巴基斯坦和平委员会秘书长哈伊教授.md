Bringing Peace and Friendship Back to Pakistan
    ——An Interview with Professor Haye, Secretary-General of the All-Pakistan Peace Committee
    By Our Correspondent Bo Sheng

    "Everyone has seen the great achievements of the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference. Peace fighters from Asia, Australia, North America, Latin America... from all remote corners came to Beijing to meet and unite under the common interests and common desire – the banner of peace. At the conference, everyone used the spirit of high democratic consultation to solve many important issues concerning the defense of peace, and passed unanimous resolutions." This is Professor Haye, a Pakistani peace delegate and Secretary-General of the All-Pakistan Peace Committee, commenting on the achievements of the peace conference.

    Haye said, "All our Pakistani delegates are determined to bring back the various resolutions of this conference to our country and convey them in depth to the broad masses of the people; to tell the people of all Pakistan about the glorious achievements of this conference."

    At this great conference of peace and friendship, there was also a major event of special significance to the people of Pakistan, that is, the delegations of Pakistan and India signed and issued a joint statement calling for a peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues between the two countries. This statement was supported by the delegates of thirty-seven countries participating in the conference and was recorded in the minutes of the conference. Everyone knows that since the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, the issue of the sovereignty of Kashmir, a large princely state located at the foot of the Himalayas, has not been resolved. This was originally deliberately created by the British government, and the people of India and Pakistan are also clearly aware of this, but this issue has always been the root cause of disputes between the two countries, and it once provoked war between India and Pakistan here, sowing deep seeds of hatred among the people of the two countries. While the snipe and clam fight, the American imperialists act as "impartial" fishermen and want to take this place as their military base for aggression by "helping" the people of the two countries solve the Kashmir issue. However, at this Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, the peace representatives of Pakistan and India found a way to solve this problem through friendly consultation, reached mutual understanding, and paved the way for a peaceful resolution to this problem that has caused the two countries to be unable to live in peace for a long time and even caused bloody conflicts.

    Professor Haye said excitedly, "This joint statement will further increase the mutual understanding between the people of Pakistan and India. After the representatives of the two countries return to their countries, they will definitely discuss how to realize this joint statement with practical actions. We will never fail everyone’s expectations for our peaceful coexistence."

    At this conference, when the two delegations presented gifts to each other after signing, when the head of the Pakistani delegation, the Islamic leader Sharif, wearing a golden hat and wearing a suit, and the head of the Indian delegation, Dr. Kitchlu, in his seventies, hugged tightly, when the female representatives of the two countries enthusiastically scattered flowers to bless each other, when the representatives of the Pakistani delegation were embraced, kissed and lifted up by the Indian representatives... everyone was moved by this moving scene. It is not difficult for people to see that the peace representatives of India and Pakistan are all rejoicing over the unanimous principle that this problem can be resolved peacefully. When Pakistani representatives went to hug Sardar Trilok Singh, the big-bearded Sikh from Uttar Pradesh, India, this big-bearded man was so moved that tears streamed down his face. Yes, the estrangement between the people of Pakistan and India caused by imperialism's rule for many years has completely disappeared between the two delegations participating in this peace conference.

    At a friendship evening held by representatives of many countries participating in the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, members of the Indian and Pakistani delegations enthusiastically performed a chorus. The lyrics were written by Syed Mutalabi, a Pakistani peace representative and organizer of the peasant movement:

    "Today, under the flag flying in Beijing,
    The people of India and Pakistan sing songs of peace.
    We are hundreds of millions of people,
    Let us erase the word war,
    Let us spread the message of peace that Beijing has brought to every
    family..."

    Professor Haye then talked about his various impressions of the new China. He said, "In China, we saw how the Chinese people live peacefully and happily, how enthusiastically they work, and how proud they are of their new life. The people love their leader – the great Mao Zedong. Everyone I came into contact with in China showed their great hearts full of internationalist friendship, and they regarded the people of the world as their brothers. Whenever we went to a place, people cheered us. I also saw freedom of religious belief. Whether they are Muslims, Buddhists, or Christians, they all live happily. People are very eager for cultural knowledge. I saw bookstores crowded with people. What impressed me most was that I had never seen a place as clean as China is today."

    He also said, "China is still an agricultural country, but the great achievements of the Chinese revolution have changed the face of the entire countryside. I visited several rural areas, where construction and development are underway, and all work is progressing vigorously with patriotic enthusiasm. Our Pakistan is also an agricultural country, and the people of our country would like to know the situation of your great peaceful construction very much. Your valuable experience will bring us great help and encouragement. I must bring everything we have seen in the new China back to Pakistan and tell our people, we must tell them about the glorious achievements of the new China under the leadership of the great Mao Zedong. I believe that through this great meeting, the friendship and unity between the people of China and Pakistan will be stronger."

    把和平与友谊带回巴基斯坦去
    ——访全巴基斯坦和平委员会秘书长哈伊教授
    本报记者　柏生
    “人们都看到了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的伟大成就。从亚洲、从澳洲、从北美、从拉丁美洲……从各个遥远的角落来到北京开会的和平战士，在共同的利益，共同的愿望——和平的旗帜下团结起来了。在会上大家用高度民主协商的精神，解决了许多关于保卫和平的重要问题，而且通过了一致的决议。”这是巴基斯坦和平代表、全巴基斯坦和平委员会秘书长哈伊教授对这次和平会议的成就的评价。
    哈伊说：“我们巴基斯坦所有的代表都决心把这次大会上的各项决议带回国内去，向广大的人民群众做深入的传达；把这次会议的辉煌成就，告诉给全巴基斯坦的人民。”
    在这和平与友谊的大会上，还有一件对巴基斯坦人民具有特殊意义的重大事件，那就是巴基斯坦和印度两国的代表团签署和发表了一个呼吁和平解决两国间一切未决问题的联合声明。这个声明得到了参加大会的三十七国代表的支持，而且在大会的记录上被记载下来了。谁都知道，从一九四七年印度和巴基斯坦实行分治以后，座落在喜马拉雅山麓的一个大土邦——克什米尔的归属问题一直没有解决。这原是英国政府有意制造的，这一点印、巴两国人民也清楚地知道，但是这个问题却一直成为两国发生纠纷的根源，而且在这里一度挑起了印巴两国的战争，在两国人民中间散播着很深的仇恨种籽。鹬蚌相争，而美帝国主义却扮做一个“公正”的渔翁插了进来，想借着“帮助”两国人民解决克什米尔问题，掠取这块地方作为它的军事侵略基地。但是，在这次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上，巴印两国的和平代表用友好协商的态度，找到了解决这个问题的办法，彼此得到了谅解，为和平解决这个造成两国长期不能和平相处甚至引起流血冲突的问题，铺平了道路。
    哈伊教授兴奋地说：“这个联合声明，将会进一步增加巴印两国人民之间的互相了解，两国代表回国后，一定会商量怎样以实际行动来实现这个联合声明。我们决不辜负大家对我们和平相处的期望。”
    在这次会议上，当两国代表团签字后互相献礼的时候，当戴着金色帽子、穿着礼服的巴基斯坦代表团团长、回教领袖沙里夫和七十多岁的印度代表团团长克其鲁博士紧紧拥抱的时候，当两国女代表互相热情抛散鲜花祝福的时候，当巴基斯坦代表团的代表们被印度代表们拥抱接吻举起来的时候，……所有的人们都为这动人的场面感动了。人们不难看出巴印两国的和平代表，都对这个问题能够得到和平解决的一致原则而欢欣鼓舞。当巴基斯坦代表去拥抱印度北方省锡克族教徒大胡子萨达尔·特里洛克·辛格的时候，这位大胡子竟感动得眼泪流了满脸。是的，多少年来，在帝国主义统治下造成的巴印两国人民的隔阂，在参加这个和平会议的两国代表团之间完全消失了。
    在参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的许多国家代表举行的一个友谊的晚会里，印度和巴基斯坦两国代表团的团员热情地表演了一个大合唱，歌词是巴基斯坦的和平代表、农民运动组织者塞依德·莫特拉比写的：
    “今天，在北京城里飘扬的旗帜下，
    印度和巴基斯坦的人民唱着和平之歌。
    我们是亿万人民，
    让我们抹掉战争这个字眼，
    让我们把北京给我们带来的和平信息传送到每一
    个家庭。……”
    哈伊教授接着谈到他对新中国的各种印象，他说：“在中国，我们看到了中国人民是怎样和平幸福地生活着，怎样热情地工作着，他们对自己的新生活是感到多么的骄傲。人民热爱自己的领袖——伟大的毛泽东。我在中国所接触的每个人都表现了他们的充满着国际主义友爱的一颗伟大的心，他们把世界人民都看作他们的兄弟。当我们每到一个地方，人们就向我们欢呼。我也看到了宗教信仰的自由，无论是回教徒，佛教徒，还是基督教徒，他们都愉快地生活着。人民要求文化知识非常迫切。我看到书店里挤满了人。尤其给我印象最深的是我从没有看到一个地方像中国今天这样的清洁。”
    他又说：“中国目前还是一个农业国家，但中国革命的伟大成就，使整个农村改变了面貌。我曾经参观了几个农村，那里正在建设着和发展着，一切工作都在爱国主义热情洋溢中蓬勃地进行着。我们巴基斯坦也是一个农业国家，我们国家的人民很想知道你们伟大的和平建设的情形。你们的宝贵经验将带给我们很大的帮助和鼓舞。我一定要把这些我们在新中国所看到的一切，带回巴基斯坦去，告诉给我们的人民，我们要告诉他们新中国在伟大的毛泽东领导下的辉煌成就。我相信通过这次伟大的会晤，我们中巴两国人民的友谊和团结会更加坚强起来。”
