Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th -- After Clark, Acheson, and their ilk used a "humanitarian" signboard to obstruct the Korean armistice talks for nearly half a year on the POW issue, they have now simply interrupted the armistice negotiations. But the whole world has clearly seen that this signboard of the U.S. side is constantly dripping with the blood of POWs.

According to the U.S. side's own news reports, since February of this year, the U.S. military has killed and wounded more than 1,200 of our captured personnel. General Nan Ri has repeatedly demanded that the U.S. side immediately stop these massacres, but Joye and Harrison completely ignored him, only shamelessly peddling "individual rights" and "humanitarian principles," while constantly massacring POWs who demanded to return home.

Former U.S. POW camp commander Bonner once vividly demonstrated this American-style "humanitarian principle." When fully armed U.S. soldiers were launching a large-scale attack on our captured personnel on June 10, killing hundreds of defenseless POWs, according to U.S. news agencies, Bonner stood on a small hill nearby, watching the U.S. military's flamethrowers burn the POWs, and shouted, "Good! Good!" When another executor of American-style "humanitarian principles"—POW camp commander Dodd—was detained by our captured personnel who resisted at the risk of their lives, his successor, Colson, "affirmed" the U.S. side's insults, tortures, forced writing of blood letters, coercion, confinement, and massacres of POWs.

Massacring POWs has in fact become a routine matter for the U.S. POW camp authorities. The "reasons" for the massacre included: singing, strolling back and forth, gathering together, hanging washed clothes in non-compliant places, and moving too slowly while performing labor; in addition, there were "demonstrations," refusing "screening," and so on. The weapons of massacre included flame-throwing tanks, tear gas, concussion grenades, rifles, bayonets, and flamethrowers. The massacred POWs included the so-called "die-hard communists" who were regarded as certainly deserving of death by the U.S. side, and also the POWs who were falsely claimed by the U.S. side as "preferring suicide to repatriation." As recently as October 1, the U.S. side killed and wounded 165 of those they called "cooperative anti-communist Chinese prisoners of war" on Jeju Island, because these captured personnel of our side who missed their motherland used singing to commemorate their motherland's National Day.

All of these are news that American news agencies have publicly disseminated. No matter how eloquent the American Goebbels may be, they will never be able to deny it. In fact, this is only a small part of the terror in the U.S. POW camps. Many POWs who were forced by the U.S. side to serve as agents and parachuted into our area reported that the U.S. POW camps also have gallows, gas chambers, steam rooms, and torture rooms; a large number of Kuomintang and Rhee Syngman gang agents have long used all kinds of cruel means to force POWs to "refuse repatriation," and after knocking the POWs unconscious, used their fingers to dip in blood and stamp fingerprints on the "voluntary repatriation" petitions.

Because the voices protesting the U.S. military's atrocities against POWs resounded throughout the world, Truman hastily ordered American generals to cover up the bloodstains in the POW camps and personally invited Asian countries to visit the POW camps to see the American "humanitarian principles," but he was met with a cold refusal. In fact, the American "humanitarian" signboard has long been so exposed that even Washington's loyal agent, the International Committee of the Red Cross, had to admit in a report in May of this year the fact that the American army massacred POWs and forced them to "refuse repatriation." Conscientious Americans, such as former Minnesota Governor Benson, angrily protested: "Where has the conscience of the American people gone when American senior military officers like Clark, Van Fleet, and Bonner would order actions that are exactly the same as Nazi barbarism without fear of condemnation?"

The U.S. side not only massacres our captured personnel, but also massacres their own captured personnel. Since January of this year, American planes have bombed and strafed our POW camps seven times, killing and wounding 199 of their own captured personnel. American representatives have also never intended to let their own captured personnel return home early and live a peaceful life. They used the proposition of detaining POWs to systematically and prolongedly obstruct the armistice, and now they have interrupted the negotiations, making the reunion of POWs with their wives and children indefinitely. The U.S. side's intention has always been to conduct a larger-scale war, driving thousands of American and puppet state soldiers to their deaths in the mountains of Korea.

The bloody facts show that the U.S. side's so-called "no forced repatriation" not only violates the Geneva Convention, but is also a fraud built on war crimes more barbaric than the Nazis.

Let all POWs go home, and the Korean War can be stopped immediately. This is our representatives' firm and unwavering position. They have repeatedly made it clear that they will fight to the end to uphold this universally recognized humanitarian principle.

### 美方的“人道主义”的招牌洒满战俘的鲜血

    美方的“人道主义”的招牌洒满战俘的鲜血
    【新华社开城十五日电】克拉克、艾奇逊之流打着一块“人道主义”的招牌，在战俘问题上阻挠朝鲜停战将近半年之后，现在更干脆中断停战谈判。但是全世界都已清楚看到，美方的这块招牌上正不断地滴着战俘的淋漓鲜血。
    根据美方自己的新闻报道，从今年二月以来，美军已打死打伤我方被俘人员一千二百多名。南日将军曾经一再要求美方立即停止这些屠杀，而乔埃、哈利逊却完全不理不睬，只是一味厚颜地叫卖“个人权利”和“人道原则”，同时不断地屠杀要求回家的战俘。
    前任美方战俘营司令波纳曾经生动地表演了这种美国式的“人道原则”。当六月十日全副武装的美国士兵正向我方被俘人员大举进攻，成百地杀死手无寸铁的战俘的时候，据美国通讯社的描述，波纳站在旁边的一座小山上，看着美军的火焰喷射器向战俘烧去，大声欢呼：“好呀！好呀！”在美国式“人道原则”的另一个执行者—战俘营司令官杜德被冒死抵抗的我方被俘人员扣留时，他的继任人柯尔生曾“肯定地承认”美方对战俘的侮辱、酷刑、强迫写血书、威逼、禁闭和集体屠杀。
    屠杀战俘事实上已经成为美方战俘营当局的例行公事。屠杀的“理由”包括：唱歌，来回遛达，聚集在一起，把洗过的衣服挂到不合规定的地方，在从事劳役时行动太慢；此外还有举行“示威”，拒绝“甄别”等等。屠杀的武器包括喷火的坦克，催泪弹，震荡弹，步枪，刺刀，火焰喷射器。被屠杀的战俘有被美方视为当然该杀的所谓“共产党死硬分子”，也有被美方谎称为“宁愿自杀而不愿遣返”的战俘。近如十月一日，美方在济州岛一次就打死打伤被他们号称为“合作反共的中国俘虏”一百六十五名，原因是这些怀念祖国的我方被俘人员用唱歌来纪念他们祖国的国庆日。
    所有这些都是美国通讯社曾经公开传播的新闻，不论美国的戈培尔们如何其舌如簧，也将永远无法抵赖。而实际上，这还只是透露了美方战俘营中的一小部分恐怖事实。许多名被美方强迫充当特务而空降到我区的战俘报告，美方战俘营中还设有绞刑台，毒气室，蒸气间，拷打室；大批蒋介石及李承晚匪帮派来的特务，长期地用尽一切残酷的手段强迫战俘“拒绝遣返”，把战俘打昏之后，用他们的手指蘸血在“自愿遣返”的请愿书上盖上指印。
    由于抗议美军残害战俘暴行的声浪响彻了全世界，杜鲁门曾经慌忙命令美国将军们掩饰战俘营的血迹，亲自邀请亚洲国家去战俘营看美国的“人道原则”，结果他遭到了冷淡的拒绝。事实上，美国的“人道”招牌，早已如此真相毕露，连华盛顿的忠顺代理人红十字国际委员会，也曾经不得不在今年五月间的一份报告中承认美国军队屠杀战俘、强迫他们“拒绝遣返”的事实。良心清白的美国人民，如前任明尼苏达州州长宾逊，曾经愤怒地抗议道：“像克拉克、范佛里特和波纳这些美国高级军官竟会下令采取这种与纳粹野蛮行为如出一辙的行动而不怕受到谴责，美国人的良心到那里去了？”
    美方不但屠杀我方被俘人员，而且也屠杀他们自己的被俘人员。自今年一月以来，美国飞机曾七次轰炸扫射我方战俘营，炸死炸伤他们自己的被俘人员一百九十九名。美国代表们也从来无意让他们自己的被俘人员早日回家过和平生活。他们用扣留战俘的主张，有计划地长期阻挠停战，现在更中断谈判，使得战俘与妻子儿女的重聚，遥遥无期。美方的意图一直是要进行更大规模的战争，把成千累万的美国及仆从国的士兵驱策到朝鲜的群山中去送死。
    血腥的事实说明美方的所谓“不得强迫遣返”，不但违反了日内瓦公约，而且是一个建筑在比纳粹还野蛮的战争罪行上的骗局。
    让所有战俘回家，朝鲜战争立即可以停止，这是我方代表坚定不移的立场。他们已一再明白表示，将为坚持这个举世公认的人道原则斗争到底。
