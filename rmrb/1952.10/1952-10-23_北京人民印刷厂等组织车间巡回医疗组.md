The medical personnel of Beijing People's Printing Factory and the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, in the patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy, organized workshop mobile medical teams and medical stations to ensure the health of employees and treat their illnesses promptly, proactively going into the workshops to serve the masses of workers.

The medical team of Beijing People's Printing Factory is divided into three groups, each equipped with one doctor and two nurses or midwives, setting up two or three medical stations in each workshop. The three groups work simultaneously during the day, and the three groups take turns on duty at night. After the establishment of the medical team, general illnesses can be treated in the workshop. Employees seeking medical attention first register with the workshop labor protection committee, who then notifies the medical team. The medical team then goes to the workshop to provide diagnosis and treatment according to the order of registration.

Medical personnel from the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory also voluntarily organized workshop mobile medical stations. Doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and registration clerks push medicine carts to the workshops to treat workers.

Since the establishment of medical teams and medical stations, the biggest advantage is that it saves workers' time for medical treatment and increases workers' production time. In the past, employees of Beijing People's Printing Factory needed an average of one to two hours for each medical visit, but now it only takes three to ten minutes. In July, 6,724 people were treated. Calculating that each person saves 50 minutes, more than 5,000 hours can be saved. The time saved is worth more than 13 million yuan in wages. The value of these work hours is even greater when used for production.

At the same time, this method can improve the efficiency of medical work and overcome the phenomenon that workers are afraid of delaying production and are unwilling to see minor illnesses, leading to serious illnesses. In the past, the medical clinic of Beijing People's Printing Factory only treated about 200 people a day, but now it can treat 500 people a day, increasing work efficiency by 150%. After the establishment of the mobile treatment station in the workshop, workers at the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory immediately went to see a doctor when they were ill, and the number of people seeking treatment for minor illnesses increased by an average of 10% to 20%. Therefore, the number of employees suffering from serious illnesses has decreased, and the number of sick leave requests has also decreased. According to a week's statistics from the People's Printing Factory, the number of workers on sick leave each day has decreased by more than 50% compared with the past.

Workers warmly welcome this style of medical personnel going to the workshops and going deep among the masses. Liu Hanbin, a worker at the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, said, "The doctor pushes a small cart to the workshop to give us medical treatment very responsibly, which is something I have never seen before!" Worker Xu Yaying also said, "Doctors coming to the workshop to give us medical treatment is like helping us to look after our machines, directly helping our production." Some workshop workers also wrote letters and posted on wall newspapers to praise the medical staff.

    北京人民印刷厂等组织车间巡回医疗组
    北京人民印刷厂、国营天津第二棉纺织厂医务人员，在爱国增产节约运动中，为保证职工身体健康，及时治好职工疾病，组织了车间巡回医疗组和医疗站，主动深入车间为职工群众服务。
    北京人民印刷厂医疗组分三个小组，每组配备大夫一人，护士或助产士二人，分别在各车间设立二、三个医疗站。白天三组同时工作，夜晚三组轮流值班。医疗组成立后，一般的病都可以在车间治疗。职工就诊，先向车间劳动保护委员登记，由劳动保护委员通知医疗组。医疗组即到车间按登记次序诊疗。
    国营天津第二棉纺织厂医务人员，也自动举办了车间巡回医疗站。大夫、护士、药剂员、挂号员一起推着药车到车间去，为工人治病。
    自举办了医疗组和医疗站后，最大的好处是节省了工人看病的时间，增加了工人生产的时间。北京人民印刷厂职工看病过去每次平均需一、二小时，现在只需三至十分钟。七月份诊治六千七百二十四人次，以每一人次节省五十分钟计，就可节省五千多小时。节省的时间约值工资一千三百多万元。这些工时用于生产上，价值就更大了。
    同时，这个方法可以提高医疗工作效率，克服了工人怕耽误生产不愿看小病、以致拖成大病的现象。北京人民印刷厂医务所，过去每天只诊治二百个人左右，现每天可诊治五百人，提高工作效率一倍半。在车间巡回治疗站成立后，国营天津第二棉纺织厂工人有了病马上就去看，看轻病的人数平均增加了百分之十至百分之二十。因此，职工患重病的减少了，请病假的也少了。据人民印刷厂一个星期的统计，每天工人请病假的人数比过去减少了百分之五十以上。
    医务人员这种面向车间、深入群众的作风，工人是热烈欢迎的。国营天津第二棉纺织厂工人刘汉斌说：“大夫推了小车到车间里来，很负责地给我们看病，真是没见过的事！”工人许雅英也说：“大夫下车间给我们看病，等于帮助我们看车一样，直接帮助了我们生产。”有些车间工人，还写信和在壁报上表扬医务人员。
