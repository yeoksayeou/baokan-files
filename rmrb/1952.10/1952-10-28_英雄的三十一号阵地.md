Heroic Hill 31
    Liming
    In June of this year, the fifteen warriors of the Second Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, defending Hill 31 in Guandaili, southwest of Kimhwa, with unparalleled heroism, fought the enemy, who outnumbered them dozens of times, in the tunnel fortifications for seven days and seven nights, annihilating more than 400 enemy soldiers, despite being cut off from the main force and facing supply difficulties. In the end, they coordinated with the main force to recapture the position, creating a brilliant example of winning with fewer troops and steadfastly defending the position.
    At three o'clock in the morning on June 12th, the Sixth Division of the Lee Syngman puppet army, with the support of more than two battalions, fourteen tanks, and dozens of artillery pieces, launched a frenzied attack on the small hill defended by the first squad, led by platoon leader He Jiasheng, with a total of eleven soldiers.
    This small hill was only 200 meters high. Opposite was the range of peaks occupied by the Sixth Division of the Lee Syngman puppet army; on the left and right were open rice paddies; the company's main position was 2,000 meters away in the rear. He Jiasheng and his ten comrades fought off sixteen enemy attacks on this unfavorable terrain stretching under the enemy's nose.
    The enemy desperately poured steel, as if trying to flatten the small hill. The loud explosions shook the hill so much that it seemed to collapse. Some of the defensive fortifications were destroyed, and the soldiers took advantage of the lulls in the fighting to rebuild them and continue fighting; the gun barrels turned red, and the exploding dirt clogged the weapons, everyone cleaned them and continued to fight; when the hand grenades and bullets ran out, they used demolition tubes, small explosive packages, and even stones to repel the enemy's attacks; some were wounded, bandaged their wounds, and continued to fight... They held a firm belief: "We will never allow the enemy to occupy an inch of our land." They engaged the enemy in a struggle for every inch of land.
    At nine o'clock in the morning, squad leader Li Jingsheng of the Seventh Squad was ordered to bring three soldiers to reinforce them. After six attacks were repelled, the enemy, like a frustrated gambler, gathered more than two hundred remnants and rushed towards the small hill. Some of the enemy even迂回around to their rear. At this critical moment, only four comrades among the fifteen volunteers were not wounded; hand grenades and bullets were running low; and the roads that could be used to contact neighboring positions were completely cut off by the enemy.
    Li Jingsheng and He Jiasheng, who had been wounded twice, studied the situation: if they used the remaining ammunition to repel this enemy attack, it would not be a problem; but, what if the enemy attacked again after the ammunition ran out? We are the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, how can we let the enemy occupy our position? Based on this situation, they decided to enter the tunnel, which had not yet been completed, to defend and cooperate with the main force in the counterattack. The position must never be lost to the enemy.
    The enemy paid the price of more than four hundred lives and spent a full ten hours to climb to the top of this small hill, only two hundred meters high. This was not their victory, they occupied the top of a volcano that would erupt with the fire of revenge at any moment.
    Li Jingsheng knew very well that the enemy would never give up. After settling the wounded, he quickly organized the battle in the tunnel. Wu Zhenhai, Wu Jingyou, Wang Qipei, and Gong Chang'an, who was wounded in the head, defended the two entrances of the tunnel; Tang Xianfu and Yang Zhengfeng, who was slightly wounded, defended the firing port; machine gunner Jia Gao guarded the middle of the tunnel with a light machine gun, providing support where needed. The slightly wounded also cleaned their weapons.
    Sure enough, shortly after Li Jingsheng finished his arrangements, more than a dozen enemies cautiously approached the tunnel entrance defended by Wu Zhenhai and Wu Jingyou. They did not dare to directly enter the underground position of the volunteer soldiers, first throwing many hand grenades into the tunnel. After receiving no response, they rushed in. Wu Zhenhai stared intently, watching the approaching enemy through the smoke of the explosions. When the enemy's clumsy body appeared at the entrance, he began to fire furiously. Most of the dozen or so enemies were killed, except for one or two who managed to escape.
    The reckless enemy, after failing to attack the tunnel entrance defended by Wu Zhenhai, turned to the tunnel entrance defended by Wang Qipei and Gong Chang'an. But the result they got was the same as the first time, leaving behind four or five more corpses.
    The volunteer soldiers' response to the enemy's two attacks on the tunnel deeply taught the enemy: it was impossible to attack the underground position of the volunteer soldiers.
    The small hill, which had been the scene of fierce fighting for twelve hours, suddenly fell silent at three o'clock in the afternoon – the enemy's attack had temporarily stopped.
    Silence in battle is often the beginning of a more intense battle. Li Jingsheng understood this very well. On the one hand, he instructed the people guarding the entrance to be vigilant, and on the other hand, he organized everyone to build simple defensive fortifications at the two tunnel entrances and a firing port.
    Time passed, but the enemy did not launch another attack.
    "What trick are the enemies up to?" Everyone speculated.
    Eighteen-year-old young soldier Tang Xianfu was a well-known active member of the entire company. Whether it was during continuous marching or during fierce fighting, as long as there was a gap, he always jumped and laughed happily. However, this sudden silence made him anxious, and he asked to go out to observe the enemy's situation. After obtaining the consent of Li Jingsheng and He Jiasheng, he skillfully climbed out of the tunnel. About five or six meters away from the entrance, he saw four enemies guarding a heavy machine gun aimed at the entrance. The enemies on the right were setting up air-to-ground liaison markings.
    It was obvious that after several failed attacks on the tunnel, the enemy had changed their plan. They attempted to block these fifteen soldiers in the tunnel and attempted to dispatch planes to destroy this heroic position, which was like a sharp steel knife inserted into their hearts.
    "Smash the enemy's dreams, take the initiative to attack!" Li Jingsheng decided after discovering the enemy's intentions.
    The counterattack began. The nimble Tang Xianfu, under the cover of Wang Qipei and Yang Zhengfeng, first climbed out of the tunnel entrance and aimed at the enemies watching the heavy machine gun and fired. Two enemies fell in response, and the remaining ones dragged the heavy machine gun and rolled down the hill. Li Jingsheng took advantage of the fact that the enemy's attention was focused on the tunnel entrance defended by Tang Xianfu, and also climbed out of the tunnel with Jia Gao. Submachine guns and machine guns roared at the enemies setting up air-to-ground liaison markings. The enemies panicked and scurried around in desperation, shouting desperately...
    That day, the main force of the Volunteer Army did not counterattack. Li Jingsheng thought: we never fight unprepared battles; if the main force is preparing, we must plan for a long-term defense. The next day, he first chose a relatively dry place in the tunnel, spread a raincoat covering the machine gun, and moved all the seriously wounded here. He also found a small box and a half of biscuits and about half an ounce of soybean oil from this tunnel, which did not yet have kitchen equipment. He decided that the seriously wounded would eat better "compressed" biscuits, and the slightly wounded and those who were not wounded would eat white flour biscuits. Three people shared a bag each day, and the soybean oil was kept for lighting when the battle was tense so that they could load bullets. He also thought: if this goes on for a long time, everyone will stick to the tunnel entrance, which will affect the counterattack cooperation with the main force due to fatigue. He formed all the people who could participate in the battle into three groups, taking turns guarding the tunnel entrance and taking turns resting. Those who had rested studied how to cooperate with the main force in the counterattack. Finally, he formed a Party group with He Jiasheng, Zhang Changming, and himself, and a Youth League group with Qin Guihua, Tang Xianfu, and other four Youth League members. He and Qin Guihua were elected as group leaders respectively. Under Li Jingsheng's patient organization, the fifteen people quickly became an invincible team with a high degree of organization and discipline.
    In the evening, a meeting was held under the chairmanship of Li Jingsheng. Everyone analyzed the current situation of the enemy and ourselves and discussed how to cooperate with the main force in the counterattack. Everyone was full of confidence in victory, and they said: "We are determined to hold the tunnel and not allow an enemy to climb in." Wang Qipei patted his submachine gun and said: "Don't think our position is not well built, with such a position, my submachine gun will guarantee that he won't be able to climb in for three days." Finally, Li Jingsheng announced the combat plan for cooperating with the main force to counterattack the enemy: the slightly wounded Yang Zhengfeng, Qu Dacheng, and Wen Qifu and the seriously wounded would defend the tunnel; the rest of the people would be divided into two groups, developing to the sides, encircling the enemy, cutting off the enemy's retreat, and not allowing an enemy to escape. Whoever captures the enemy's heavy machine gun on the top of the hill will be recommended for commendation...
    The main force still did not counterattack the next day or the third day. As time went on, the situation of the fifteen warriors defending the tunnel became more and more difficult. Six of the fifteen were seriously wounded who could not even crawl, and there was no medical treatment; the tunnel, because it had not yet been repaired, had no ventilation equipment, and the enemy kept throwing hand grenades into the tunnel, the tunnel was often filled with unpleasant sulfur gas, and there was no fresh air. More seriously, there was no water. There was only a small box and a half of biscuits in the tunnel, but because there was no water, the biscuits were like made of sand, turning around and around in the mouth, refusing to stick together and refusing to go down the throat. The uninjured comrades could persevere, but in this hot June weather, how much did the wounded and bleeding need water? On the third day, three seriously wounded were unable to speak due to thirst.
    On the afternoon of the fourth day, the sky suddenly became overcast, and thunder faintly entered the tunnel. Everyone was extremely happy, putting all the small bowls, kettles, and wooden boxes that could hold water at the tunnel entrance. Wang Qipei also dug a small ditch at the tunnel entrance and put a piece of raincoat on it. Everyone confidently believed that this time they could drink their fill. However, the thunder continued to roar, but it did not rain. After a while, a strong wind blew, and the clouds were blown away. Everyone's hopes turned into disappointment again. There was really no way, so they could only put their mouths on the damp stones and suck a little moisture to quench their thirst. But how could this solve the thirst of not drinking a drop of water for three days and three nights?
    Although the environment was like this, a strong belief encouraged everyone: "Defend the position, this is the order of the people of the motherland, we will never retreat a step; the main force will definitely come to counterattack, and victory will definitely be ours." Everyone still maintained a tense combat mood, cleaned their weapons when they had time, and studied the tactics for cooperating with the main force in counterattacking the enemy. The word "water" was tabooed, and no one mentioned it.
    In order to solve this serious problem, on the fourth day, they held Party and Youth League group meetings respectively. All the Communist Party members and Youth League members unanimously stated: "This is the time to test us. The more difficult it is, the more we must show the firm will of Communist Party members and Youth League members, and resolutely unite everyone to hold the position." And passed a resolution: send someone out of the tunnel to fetch water from the fortifications where they originally planned to cook to relieve the emergency.
    At two o'clock in the morning on the same day, they carried out the first task of fetching water. He Jiasheng felt that this was an important issue in whether they could hold the position for a long time. Therefore, he climbed to the tunnel entrance and personally directed the battle to fetch water; Zhang Changming also used all his strength to support his twice-wounded body, climbed to the tunnel entrance, and personally used a light machine gun to provide cover. After machine gunner Jia Gao climbed out of the tunnel under everyone's cover, excellent Communist Party member Li Jingsheng also climbed out of the tunnel to provide cover. Jia Gao skillfully dodged the enemy's fire and brought back half a bucket of water. Everyone was extremely happy, first letting the wounded comrades drink, and then everyone was only given half a small bowl of water. Now water was sweeter than anything else. Wang Qipei put the small bowl to his lips to wash his lips, and quickly took it down. He happily said: "This is like the water in our Sichuan, it's so sweet!"
    Having drunk the water, everyone's confidence in holding the position became stronger. They cleaned their weapons spotlessly; repeatedly studied the tactics for cooperating with the main force in counterattacking the enemy; talked about the great construction of the motherland reported by the returning delegates; and also talked about everyone's plans after defeating American imperialism and ensuring peace. Squad leader Qin Guihua even sang a ditty to support the front line. On the fifth day, they repelled more than ten enemy attacks and actively attacked the enemy five times.
    Having drunk the water, they felt even hungrier. The only small box and a half of biscuits in the tunnel were reduced from three people per bag to four or five people per bag. Later, they could not be distributed by bag but by piece. By the fifth day, everyone only received a very small amount of biscuit crumbs.
    On the sixth day, Li Jingsheng counted and found that they had repelled a total of 116 enemy attacks throwing bombs into the tunnel, and actively attacked the enemy 23 times. However, all the edibles in the tunnel were only eight biscuits. There were only fifteen hand grenades left; and no more than two hundred rounds of various bullets. He and He Jiasheng estimated that the main force might think that we were all sacrificed, otherwise they would never come to counterattack until now. In order to hold the position, they decided to send someone to contact the main force.
    Contacting the main force was an arduous task. They didn't know the situation of the main force, they had to break through the enemy's blockade... all this required not only the determination to be prepared to sacrifice at any time, but also a strong physical strength. After He Jiasheng and Li Jingsheng's repeated consideration, they finally decided that Communist Party member Zhang Changming would lead Wang Qipei, Wu Zhenhai, and two slightly wounded comrades to take on the task of contacting the main force. Everyone placed their hopes on the five of them. Everyone happily sent them off, wiping their guns, loading their bullets, and preparing for them. He Jiasheng took out three of the only eight biscuits and distributed them to them, and gave each of them half a bowl of water, telling them to eat well to gain strength. He shook hands with each of the five people. Repeatedly instructing: "Be careful! Don't forget to light a fire to tell us after you contact the main force."
    He Jiasheng, Li Jingsheng, and all the comrades sent off the five comrades with great hope. Not long after they left, a burst of violent hand grenade explosions and machine gun fire came into the tunnel, and after a while it became silent again. Everyone was worried about this fierce battle, but everyone tried to dispel some unfortunate thoughts. Everyone did not close their eyes all night, waiting to see the fire of contact, waiting to cooperate with the main force in the counterattack. However, they did not see the fire all night, and everyone thought in unison: they must have sacrificed.
    None of the five people, including Zhang Changming, who broke through the enemy's encirclement, sacrificed. The next morning, they found the battalion headquarters. Battalion Commander Wang Yuangeng, who was preparing to launch a counterattack, immediately picked up the telephone receiver to notify the artillery troops to bombard the enemy after listening to their report on defending the tunnel; and found Deputy Company Commander Ren Weisheng, asking him to prepare quickly and lead a squad back to the tunnel tonight to prepare to cooperate with the main force in the counterattack. Wang Qipei was so happy that he wanted to jump up when he heard that someone would be sent back to the tunnel. He asked to be a guide and fight back with the troops. The battalion commander thought for a while and agreed to his request. That night, they set off towards the tunnel.
    At the same time, the ten warriors who were still defending in the tunnel held a common belief: "We cannot let the enemy trap us in the tunnel for nothing; as long as people are alive, the position will always be ours." They also decided to fight out, and they climbed out of the tunnel entrance that had been pulled up halfway with barbed wire by the enemy. Tang Xianfu, who was walking in the front and responsible for scouting the road, met Wang Qipei, the deputy company commander, and new comrades who were fighting back not far after climbing out. He climbed in the communication trench, holding the deputy company commander's hand tightly, not knowing what to say. Suddenly, he felt like something was crawling on his face, he quickly wiped away the tears that were about to flow to his mouth, and immediately said firmly: "Deputy company commander, you are here! We will go back to the tunnel with you and defend the position together."
    The enemy discovered them, and hand grenades were constantly thrown at the entrance. Li Jingsheng lay in the communication trench, covering every comrade who climbed out. After everyone had left the tunnel, he carefully looked at the tunnel and muttered to himself: "The position will always be ours." He just turned around to leave, when a familiar voice made him tremble. He quickly turned around and shook the deputy company commander's hand tightly.
    "You have worked hard! Quickly wipe the blood from your face and go to the division to attend the commendation meeting on behalf of the comrades who defended the tunnel. We will defend here." Before he could speak, the deputy company commander told him abruptly.
    Li Jingsheng touched his head, which had just been broken by the enemy's shrapnel, and led the six wounded comrades away from the underground position that they had defended for seven days and seven nights, reluctantly, under the cover of the deputy company commander and the newly arrived comrades. Jia Gao, Wang Qipei, Tang Xianfu, and Wen Qifu followed the deputy company commander back to the tunnel. The tunnel gained new strength.
    At seven o'clock in the afternoon on the 21st, the Volunteer Army's artillery of various calibers, hidden in various fortifications in the deep mountains and depressions, fiercely bombarded Hill 31. The attacking troops rushed towards Hill 31 like surging waves. The warriors defending in the tunnel rushed out of the tunnel before the attacking troops approached and launched an attack on the enemy. Warrior Wang Bin led a group, first attacked the top of the hill, and seized the enemy's heavy machine gun that blocked our attacking road. Under our internal and external attacks, the battle ended victoriously in less than ten minutes. For a full ten days and ten nights, the enemy did not pull out a single hair from the warriors, on the contrary, they left behind more than eighty corpses.
    Li Jingsheng, representing the fifteen comrades who defended the tunnel, attended the commendation meeting in the division, wearing a big red flower presented to him by the Korean people, standing on the peak looking at Hill 31. Various signal flares rose from the position. This was a signal of victory, it illuminated the sky, illuminated the beautiful Korean land, and also illuminated the warriors' victorious future in fighting for peace.

    英雄的三十一号阵地
    黎明
    今年六月，中国人民志愿军某部二连，坚守在金城西南官岱里三十一号阵地上的十五位勇士，在与主力失去联系、供应困难的情况下，以无比的英雄气概，在坑道工事里与超过自己数十倍的敌人，整整战斗了七天七夜，歼灭敌人四百余名。最后又配合主力夺回了阵地，创造了以少胜多、坚守阵地的光辉范例。
    六月十二日早上三点钟，李承晚伪军第六师以两个多营的兵力，在十四辆坦克和数十门大炮的掩护下，向着一排副何家胜率领的第一班共十一个人坚守的那个小山包，发起了疯狂的进攻。
    这个小山包，仅有二百公尺高。对面是李承晚伪军第六师盘踞的群峰；左右两侧是一片开阔的稻田；后面两千公尺远的地方才是连的主阵地。何家胜和十位战友，就在这个伸展在敌人鼻尖下的不利地形上，打退了敌人十六次的攻击。
    敌人像要把这个小山包轰平一样，数十门大炮拚命地倾泻着钢铁。爆炸的巨响，震动得这个小山包都要塌下去了。附防工事有的被打毁了，战士们趁着战斗的间隙，再把它们修筑起来，继续战斗；枪筒打红了，爆炸的泥土堵塞了武器，大家擦洗干净，仍旧战斗；手榴弹、子弹打光了，就用爆破筒、小包炸药、甚至石头打退敌人的攻击；有的人负伤了，就把伤口包扎起来，还是战斗……。他们怀着一个坚强的信念：“决不允许敌人占领我们一寸土地。”他们与敌人展开了分寸土地的争夺战。
    上午九点钟，七班长李经盛奉命带着三个战士赶来增援。敌人在六次攻击都被打退之后，像输恼了的赌鬼一样，又收罗了二百多个残兵败将，一齐涌向这个小山包。一部分敌人并迂回到了他们的侧后。就在这紧急的关头，志愿军阵地上的十五个人中只有四个同志没有负伤；手榴弹、子弹也剩下不多了；与友邻阵地能够联络的道路也完全被敌人切断了。
    李经盛和两次负伤的何家胜研究了这个情况：如果用剩下的弹药打退敌人这次的攻击是不成问题的；但是，弹药打光以后，敌人再攻击怎么办呢？我们是中国人民志愿军，怎能让敌人占领我们的阵地呢？根据这个情况，他们决定进入还没有修好的坑道坚守，配合主力反击。阵地是决不能丢给敌人的。
    敌人付出了四百多条生命的代价，化费了整整十个小时的工夫，才爬上了这个仅有二百公尺高的小山包的山顶。这并不是他们的胜利，他们所占领的，是每一个时刻都要爆发出复仇之火的火山顶。
    李经盛很清楚，敌人是绝不会就此罢休的。他安置好了伤员之后，就迅速组织了坑道里的战斗。吴振海、吴经友、王启培和头部负伤的龚长安分别坚守坑道的两个进口；唐先富和负轻伤的杨政风坚守对敌射击口；机枪射手贾高带一挺轻机枪守在坑道中间，那里需要，支援那里。轻伤员也一律动手擦洗武器。
    果然，在李经盛刚布置停当之后，十多个敌人便躲躲闪闪地逼近了吴振海和吴经友坚守的坑道口，他们不敢直接走进志愿军战士们的地下阵地，先向坑道内投了许多手榴弹，等到没有得到回击之后，便一齐拥了过来。吴振海用力瞪着眼，从爆炸的烟雾中注视着爬来的敌人。当敌人笨拙的身体出现在洞口时，他便开始了猛烈地射击。十几个敌人，除了一两个侥幸逃脱之外，大部分送掉了性命。
    不知死活的敌人，在攻击吴振海坚守的坑道口失败之后，又转向了王启培和龚长安坚守的坑道口。但是，他们所得到的结果和第一次一样，又留下了四、五个尸体。
    志愿军战士们对敌人两次攻击坑道的回答，深深地教训了敌人：要想攻进志愿军战士们的地下阵地，是不可能的。
    整整进行了十二个小时的激烈战斗的小山包，在下午三点钟突然沉默了起来——敌人的进攻暂时停止了。
    战斗中的沉默，往往是更激烈的战斗的开始。李经盛很明白这一点。他一面嘱咐坚守洞口的人提高警惕，一面组织大家在两个坑道的进口和一个射击口，筑起了简单的防御工事。
    时间一刻一刻地过去了，敌人仍没有再发动进攻。
    “敌人在捣什么鬼呢？”大家都揣测着。
    十八岁的青年战士唐先富，是全连有名的活跃分子。不论是在连续行军，也不论是在进行激烈的战斗，只要有了空隙，他总是兴高彩烈地蹦蹦跳跳，又说又笑。然而，这突然的沉默，使他着了急，他要求出去观察一下敌人的情况。在取得李经盛和何家胜的同意之后，他灵巧地爬出坑道，在离洞口五、六公尺远的地方，他看到有四个敌人守着一挺重机枪正对着洞口，右面阵地上的敌人正在布置对空联络记号。
    很明显，敌人在几次攻击坑道失败之后，改变了计划，他们企图把这十五位战士封锁在坑道里，并企图调遣飞机来毁灭这个像一把锐利的钢刀插在他们心中的英雄阵地。
    “粉碎敌人的梦想，主动出击！”李经盛发现了敌人的企图之后，这样决定下来。
    出击的战斗开始了。灵活的唐先富在王启培、杨政风的掩护下首先爬出坑道口，瞄准看守重机枪的敌人射击起来，两个敌人应声倒下了，剩下的连忙拖着重机枪滚下山去了。李经盛趁着敌人把注意力都集中在唐先富坚守的坑道口时，和贾高也爬出坑道，冲锋枪、机关枪一齐向布置对空联络的敌人吼叫起来。敌人惊慌了没命地到处乱窜着，绝望地喊叫着……
    这一天，志愿军的主力没有反击。李经盛想：我们从来是不打没有准备的仗的；主力要进行准备，我们就要作长期坚守的打算。第二天，他首先在坑道里选择了一块比较干燥的地方，铺上包机枪的雨布，把重伤员都搬到这里。他又从这个还没有伙房设备的坑道里搜出一小箱半饼干和约一两豆油。他决定重伤员吃好一点的“压缩”饼干，轻伤员和没有负伤的吃白面饼干。每天三人一包，豆油留着在战斗紧张时点灯照着压子弹。他又想到：长期下去，大家都坚守在坑道口，会因疲劳影响到对主力的反击配合。他把所有能够参加战斗的人，组成三个小组，轮流坚守坑道口，轮流休息。休息过了的人就研究怎样配合主力反击。最后，他又把何家胜、张长明和他自己三个共产党员组成一个党的小组，把覃贵华、唐先富等四个青年团员组成一个团小组，他和覃贵华分别被选为小组长。十五个人，在李经盛耐心的组织下，迅速地变成了一支有高度组织性、纪律性的不可战胜的队伍。
    晚上，在李经盛主持下召开了一次会议。大家分析了当前的敌我形势，讨论了如何配合主力反击。所有的人都充满着胜利的信心，他们表示：“坚决守住坑道，不许一个敌人爬进一步。”王启培拍拍他的冲锋枪说：“别看我们的阵地没修好，有这样的阵地，我这一支冲锋枪，也保证叫他三天也爬不进
    一个来。”最后，李经盛宣布了配合主力反击敌人的作战计划：轻伤员杨政风、曲大成、温启福三个人和重伤员坚守坑道；其余的人分成两组，向两侧发展，包围敌人，切断敌人的退路，不许一个敌人跑掉。谁夺下敌人山顶上的重机枪，给谁请功……
    第二天、第三天主力还没有反击。随着时间的延长，坚守在坑道里的十五位战士的处境，也愈来愈困难了。十五个人有六个是连爬都爬不动了的重彩号，又没有医药治疗；坑道因为还没有修好，没有通风设备，加上敌人不断地向坑道里投掷手榴弹，坑道里经常充满着难闻的硫磺气，没有一点新鲜空气。更严重的是没有水。坑道里仅有一小箱半饼干，但因为没有水，饼干就像用沙子做成的一样，在嘴里转来转去，不肯粘在一起，不肯往喉咙里进。没有负伤的同志还可以坚持一下，可是在这酷热的六月天，负了伤，流了血的人是多么需要水呢？第三天就有三个重伤员因为干渴的关系，连话都说不出了。
    第四天下午，天突然阴了起来，雷声隐约地传进坑道来。大家高兴极了，把所有能够盛住水的小碗、水壶、木箱都放在坑道口。王启培又在坑道口挖了一个小沟，上面放上块雨布，大家满怀信心地认为，这次可能喝个饱了。可是，雷不断地轰鸣，就是不下雨，一会又刮起大风，云也被吹散了。大家的希望又变为失望了。实在没法，只有把嘴对在潮湿的石头上、吮吸一点潮气来解渴。可是，这又怎能解决三天三夜没喝一口水的干渴呢？
    环境虽然如此，但有一个坚强的信念在鼓舞着大家：“坚守阵地，这是祖国人民的命令，我们决不后退一步；主力一定会来反击，胜利一定是我们的。”大家仍保持着紧张的战斗情绪，有了时间便擦洗武器，研究配合主力反击敌人的战术。对“水”字则像忌讳一样，谁都不提。
    为了解决这个严重的问题，第四天，他们分别召开了党、团员小组会。全体共产党员和青年团员一致表示：“这正是考验我们的时候，越艰苦，我们就越要表现出共产党员、青年团员的坚定意志，坚决团结大家坚守住阵地。”并通过了一个决议：派人打出坑道，到原来准备做饭的工事里取水救急。
    当天午夜两点钟，他们执行了第一次取水的任务。何家胜感到这是能否长期坚守住阵地的重要问题。因此，他爬到坑道口，亲自指挥了这次取水的战斗；张长明也用尽全力支持着两次负伤的身体，爬到坑道口，亲自使用轻机枪担任掩护。当机枪射手贾高在大家掩护下爬出坑道之后，优秀的共产党员李经盛也跟着爬出坑道进行掩护。贾高灵活地躲过敌人的射击，提回半桶水来，大家高兴极了，先让伤员同志喝，然后每人仅分到半小碗水。现在水比什么都甜。王启培把小碗放到嘴边上洗一洗嘴唇，又赶快拿了下来，他高兴地说：“这好像我们四川的水一样，真甜哪！”
    喝到了水，大家对坚守阵地的信心就更加坚强起来了。他们把武器擦得干干净净；反复地研究配合主力反击的战术；谈论着归国代表报告的祖国的伟大建设；也谈论着打败美帝国主义、和平有了保障之后的每个人的计划。一班长覃贵华并唱起了支援前线小调。第五天他们又打退了敌人十多次的攻击，并主动袭击敌人五次。
    喝到了水，也就更显得饿了。坑道里仅有的一小箱半饼干，从每天三人一包，减到四人、五人一包。后来不能论包而是论片分配了，到第五天，大家只分到了很少一点饼干的碎末。
    第六天，李经盛统计了一下，他们共打退了敌人一百一十六次向坑道投弹的袭击，并主动袭击敌人二十三次。但是，坑道里所有能吃的东西也只有八片饼干了。手榴弹仅剩下十五枚；各种子弹也不超过二百发了。他和何家胜估计，可能是主力认为我们都牺牲了，不然绝不会到现在还不来反击。为了守住阵地，他们决定派人找主力联系。
    联系主力是一个艰巨的任务。不晓得主力的情况，要冲破敌人的封锁……这一切不仅需要有时刻准备牺牲的决心，而且需要有坚强的体力。经过何家胜和李经盛的再三考虑，最后决定由共产党员张长明带领王启培、吴振海和两个负轻伤的同志担负联系主力的任务，所有的人都把希望寄托在他们五个人身上。大家兴高彩烈地欢送他们，擦枪的擦枪、压子弹的压子弹，替他们准备停当。何家胜从仅有的八片饼干中拿出三片分给他们，每人再分给半碗水，叫他们吃了好长点力气。他挨个握着五个人的手。反复地嘱咐着：“千万小心！别忘了在联络上主力后，放一堆火告诉我们。”
    何家胜、李经盛和所有的同志都怀着极大的希望，送走了五个战友。在他们走后不久，一阵猛烈的手榴弹爆炸声，机枪声传进坑道来，一会儿又沉寂下去了。所有的人都为着这场激烈的战斗而担心，但是大家还是努力抛掉一些不幸的想法。大家一夜没有合上眼，等待着看联络的火光，等待着配合主力反击。但是，整整一夜也没有看到火光，所有的人都不约而同地想着：他们一定是牺牲了。
    冲出敌人重围的张长明等五个人，一个也没有牺牲，第二天清晨，他们便找到了营指挥部。正准备进行反击战的王远更营长，在听完了他们坚守坑道的报告后，立即一面抓起电话耳机通知炮兵部队向敌人轰击；一面找副连长任为生，要他迅速准备，今天晚上带领一个班打回坑道去，准备配合主力反击。王启培听说就要派人打回坑道，高兴得要跳起来。他要求当向导，和部队一起打回去。营长思索了一会，便答应了他的要求。当日夜半，他们就向着坑道出发了。
    与此同时，仍然坚守在坑道里的十位战士，怀着一个共同的信念：“不能让敌人白白把我们困死在坑道里；人活着，阵地就永远是我们的。”他们也决定打出去，他们爬出了已经被敌人拉上了半截铁丝网的坑道口。走在最前面负责侦察道路的唐先富，爬出不远就与打回来的王启培、副连长和新的战友们会合了。他爬在交通壕里，紧握着副连长的手，不知说什么才好。忽然，他觉得脸上像有什么东西在爬一样，他迅速擦去了快流到嘴边的眼泪，马上坚定地说：“副连长，你们来了！我们跟你一起回到坑道去，共同坚守阵地。”
    敌人发觉了他们，手榴弹不断地扔向洞口。李经盛卧在交通沟里，掩护着每一个爬出来的战友。当所有的人都离开坑道之后，他又仔细地看了一下坑道暗暗自语着：“阵地永远是我们的。”他刚回身要走，一个熟悉的声音使他不禁颤抖了一下。他迅速转过身去，紧握着副连长的手。
    “你们辛苦了！快擦去脸上的血，马上代表坚守坑道的同志们到师里参加贺功会去。这里由我们来坚守。”副连长没等他说话，便截然地告诉了他。
    李经盛摸了一下刚被敌人的弹片打破了的头，带领着六个负伤的同志，在副连长和新来的战友们的掩护下，恋恋不舍地离开了坚守了七天七夜的地下阵地。贾高、王启培、唐先富、温启福又跟随副连长回到了坑道。坑道里增加了新的力量。
    二十一日下午七点钟，隐蔽在深山、洼地各种工事里的志愿军各种口径的大炮，齐向三十一号阵地猛烈轰击。各攻击部队像汹涌的海浪一样扑向三十
    一号阵地。坚守在坑道里的战士们，没有等到攻击部队接近，便冲出坑道，向敌人发起了攻击。战士王斌带领一个组，首先攻上山顶，夺下了敌人封锁我攻击道路的重机枪。在我内外夹击下，不足十分钟，战斗便胜利结束了。整整十天十夜，敌人没有拔去战士们的一根汗毛，相反地，他们却又丢下了八十多个尸体。
    代表着坚守坑道的十五位战友在师里参加贺功大会的李经盛，胸前戴着朝鲜人民献给他的大红花，站立在高峰上眺望着三十一号阵地。阵地上升起了各色的讯号弹。这是胜利的信号，它照亮了天空，照亮了美丽的朝鲜土地，也照亮了战士们为和平而战的胜利前程。
