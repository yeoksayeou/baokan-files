Volunteer Army Soldier's Family Member Cui Baolin Writes to Son, Reports on Hometown Situation and Encourages Him to Heroically Kill the Enemy

Fushou, my son: It has been two years since the Volunteer Army went abroad to fight. In these two years, your glorious achievements have greatly inspired the peace-loving people of the world, strengthened their determination to defend peace, and strengthened the forces for defending peace. With infinite excitement, I extend my respects to you and your comrades, and wish you good health!

Since you left, the People's Government and the villagers have taken very good care of our family. During the New Year and holidays, they always come to our home to express their regards and bring gifts. Since last year, the villagers have helped our family with fourteen workdays and a large cart of manure every year. Originally, my health was very good, and I was able to work, so there was no need for help, but the masses still wanted to help me with work. They said: Your child is at the front lines in Korea for us, and we have a responsibility to help you with work. Because of everyone's help in intensive farming, our family harvested enough grain last year to buy three ewes after eating and wearing. This year's harvest is even better. Two mu of paddy fields yielded 2 million yuan; seven mu and seven fen of dry land yielded more than ten dan of grain. With increased income, our family's life has also improved. Your younger brother and sister are studying in the village's complete primary school, and your younger brother will graduate next year!

Speaking of our village, there have also been tremendous changes. More than 90 percent of the children in the village are enrolled in school. The results of promoting the quick literacy method are the best in the district. The People's Government awarded the village a bright gasoline lamp. The villagers happily said: During the day, we engage in mutual aid production, and at night, we study under the gasoline lamp, truly combining production and study. In the patriotic production increase campaign, the villagers' thinking has improved. This year alone, twelve new mutual aid teams and labor exchange teams have been organized. As a result of organizing collective labor, the entire village's more than 2,200 mu of autumn land can produce an average of one dou more per mu than last year, which has increased the strength to resist America and aid Korea.

Fushou, my son, the changes in our family and our village are truly endless. These advances are inseparable from your contributions to resisting America and aiding Korea at the front. I hope you will work hard to kill the enemy in Korea; I will also actively produce to support you.

    志愿军军属崔保林给儿子写信
    报告家乡情况并鼓励他英勇杀敌
    福寿儿：志愿军出国作战两周年了。在这两年当中，你们的辉煌战绩，对全世界和平人民起了很大的鼓舞作用，增强了他们保卫和平的决心，也加强了保卫和平的力量。我以无限兴奋的心情，特向你和你的同伴们致敬，并祝你们的身体健康！
    你走后，人民政府和老乡们对咱家照顾得非常周到，过年过节，总要到咱家来慰问，还送这送那的。从去年开始，老乡们每年还帮咱十四个工、一大车粪。本来我的身体很好，能劳动，用不着帮工，可是群众仍要帮助我干活，他们说：你孩子在朝鲜前线为咱们，我们有责任帮你干活呀。因为大家帮助精耕细作的结果，去年咱家打的粮食除吃穿外，还买了三只母羊。今年的收成更好。二亩水地收入二百万元；七亩七分旱地，打了十石多粮食。收入增多，咱家的生活也变好了。你弟弟和妹妹在村里的完全小学读书，弟弟明年就要毕业啦！
    提起咱村，也有着天大的变化。全村百分之九十以上的儿童都入了学，推行速成识字法的成绩全区数第一，人民政府奖给村上一盏明亮亮的汽灯，老乡们高兴地说：白天互助生产，黑夜在汽灯下学习，真是生产学习两不误。在爱国增产竞赛运动当中，老乡们的思想都提高了，光今年就新组织了十二个互助组和变工组。由于组织起来进行集体劳动的结果，全村二千二百多亩秋地，平均每亩可比去年增产一斗，这就增加了抗美援朝的力量。
    福寿儿，咱家和咱村的变化真是说也说不完，这些进步都是和你们在前线抗美援朝的功劳分不开的。希望你在朝鲜努力杀敌；我也积极生产支援你们。
