    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 2nd. After Harrison put forward three alternative methods on September 28, he extended the recess period of the armistice negotiations from seven days to ten days. This so-called "alternative proposal" is still the same old trick of the US side refusing to let all prisoners of war return home to live a peaceful life in accordance with the agreement between the two sides. This proposal is tantamount to openly refusing to repatriate prisoners of war in accordance with the 1949 Geneva Convention and allowing them to return to the side to which they belong.

    Harrison said: "One of our non-negotiable demands is non-forcible repatriation." In this way, he showed that this was still the US demand to detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. From this, he proved that his "new alternative proposal" was only to achieve the US demand to detain prisoners of war, and not "a way to accommodate the requirements of both sides to a considerable extent."

    Observers here pointed out: There is nothing new in these "alternative proposals." Accepting this proposal would mean that prisoners of war would give up their right to repatriation, which cannot be waived according to the Geneva Convention. The only difference is the change of tricks, which shows that they are using words to carry out more blatant deception, and do not sincerely want to solve the prisoner of war problem based on the principles that have already been agreed upon.

    Harrison promised that "as soon as the armistice agreement comes into effect, all prisoners of war detained by both sides should be released and repatriated." But he immediately revealed that this statement was just a pretense, because he said: transporting all prisoners of war to the demilitarized zone "should be regarded as fully repatriated for the purpose of the agreement." The most absurd part of Harrison's proposal is that he said: prisoners of war who have not been repatriated will have "civilian status." But he has not yet said: Chinese prisoners of war will be handed over to Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan. Harrison's "alternative proposal" only changed the method of detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, that is: to transport them to the demilitarized zone and hand them over to puppets such as Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek to serve as cannon fodder.

    Observers here are well aware that Harrison's "alternative proposal" is in line with Washington's strategy of delaying negotiations with obstructionist tricks and complicating simple issues. They pointed out that if the US representatives abide by the 1949 Geneva Convention, which stipulates the repatriation of all prisoners of war after the armistice, the armistice agreement could have been reached five months ago. If Harrison had been sincere in implementing Articles 51 and 52 of the armistice agreement regarding sending prisoners of war home to live a peaceful life, the armistice agreement could have been reached at any time in the past few months. However, since Harrison took over from Joy, he first absented himself from meetings, then adjourned for three days, a week, and now even for ten days, showing a refusal to negotiate. Under Harrison's obstruction, the armistice negotiations have been adjourned for more than two and a half months. This adjournment time is even longer than the two months and two days of adjournment from August 23 to October 24 last year due to Ridgway's bombing of the Korean and Chinese delegation's residence in Kaesong. Harrison continued to adopt Ridgway's sabotage strategy, using forced adjournments to undermine the negotiations.

    While Harrison forced the adjournment, the US side's killings of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war occurred every month. According to reports from American news agencies alone, more than a thousand Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have been killed or wounded since February. Last month and this month, General Nam Il protested against these killings of prisoners of war almost every week, but Harrison showed a deliberate murderous attitude, ignored these protests, and continued the killings. Harrison refused to let all prisoners of war go home, but would rather kill them, or force them to fight to the death, or force them to commit suicide.

    General Nam Il once again reminded Harrison that this is a matter of principle. Harrison's "alternative proposal" cannot deceive anyone. The only way to achieve an armistice is to let all prisoners of war go home to live a peaceful life. Any proposal to detain prisoners of war, no matter what form it takes, is unacceptable.

### 开城观察家揭穿美方“新建议”的骗局  美方依然阴谋强迫扣留我方被俘人员

    开城观察家揭穿美方“新建议”的骗局
    美方依然阴谋强迫扣留我方被俘人员
    【新华社开城二日电】哈利逊在九月二十八日提出了三个任择其一的办法之后，把停战谈判的休会期限从七天延长到十天。这种所谓“任择其一的建议”还是美方拒绝按照双方的协议让全部战俘回家过和平生活的老一套。这种建议等于是公开拒绝按照一九四九年日内瓦公约来遣返战俘并使他们回到他们所属的一方。
    哈利逊说：“我方的不能让步的要求之一是不强迫遣返。”这样他就表明了这还是美方过去的那个扣留朝中战俘的要求。由此，他证明了：他的“任择其一的新建议”只不过是为了达到美方拘留战俘的要求而已，而不是“在相当程度上适应双方要求的办法”。
    此间观察家指出：这些“任择其一的建议”中没有什么新的东西。接受这种建议就意味着战俘要放弃遣返的权利，而根据日内瓦公约的规定，这种权利是不能放弃的。唯一的不同只是花样改变，这就表现他们在用文字来进行更无耻的欺骗，而并不想根据已经获得协议的原则来诚心解决战俘问题。
    哈利逊保证“一俟停战协议生效，双方拘留的全部战俘均应予以释放和遣返”。但是他立刻暴露出这种说法只不过是装模作样，因为他说：把全部战俘运到非军事区，“就应被视为按照协议的目的全部遣返了”。哈利逊建议中的最荒谬的地方是他说：没有被遣返的战俘就具有“平民的身份”。但是他还没有说：中国战俘将交给台湾的蒋介石。哈利逊的“任择其一的建议”只不过在拘留朝中战俘的方法上有了改变而已，这就是：把他们运到非军事区并把他们交给李承晚和蒋介石等傀儡去当炮灰。
    此间观察家都很清楚地认识到：哈利逊的“任择其一的建议”，是与华盛顿的以阻挠的诡计来拖延谈判、并使简单问题复杂化的策略相符合的。他们指出，如果美国代表遵守规定停战后遣返全部战俘的一九四九年日内瓦公约的话，停战协定本来在五个月以前就可以获致的。如果哈利逊有诚意执行停战协议中关于送战俘回家过和平生活的第五十一款和五十二款的话，停战协定本来在过去几个月中的任何时候都可以获致的。然而哈利逊自从继乔埃之任以来，就始则逃会，继之以休会三天、一星期，现在甚至休会十天，表现了拒绝谈判的态度。在哈利逊的阻挠下，停战谈判一共已休会两个半月以上了。这样休会的时间比去年八月二十三日至十月二十四日由于李奇微轰炸开城的朝中代表团住所而休会的那一段两个月零两天的休会时间还要长。哈利逊继续采用李奇微的破坏策略，用强行休会的办法来破坏谈判。
    与哈利逊强行休会的同时，美方屠杀朝中战俘的事件每月都在发生。仅仅根据美国通讯社的报道，自从二月以来，已有一千多名朝中战俘被打死或打伤。上月和本月，南日将军差不多每周都要就这些屠杀战俘的事件提出抗议，但是，哈利逊表现了蓄意杀人的态度，对这些抗议置之不理，并且继续进行屠杀。哈利逊不肯让所有战俘都回家，而宁愿把他们杀死，或逼他们不得不进行决死的斗争，逼他们自杀。
    南日将军再度提醒哈利逊说，这是一个原则问题。哈利逊的“任择其一的建议”骗不了任何人，获致停战的唯一道路就是让全部战俘都回家过和平生活。任何扣留战俘的建议，不管它用的是什么形式，都是不能接受的。
