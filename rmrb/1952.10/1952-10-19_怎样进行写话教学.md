How to Conduct Writing Instruction
Beijing Eastern Suburban District Literacy Movement Committee Office

Writing instruction is an important stage in accelerated literacy teaching. It is carried out in conjunction with teaching activities such as intensive reading of texts and reading popular reading materials, accounting for about one-third of the total teaching time. For example, our citizen classes spend 347 hours on the entire teaching and review process, while writing instruction accounts for 140 hours. After this period of teaching, students are required to be able to write everyday application documents such as letters and diaries of 300 to 500 words (some individuals can write more than 1,000 words), as well as general narrative and explanatory texts (some students should be able to write news reports).

Laying a Solid Foundation for Writing Instruction

Writing instruction needs to be carried out on the basis of consolidating the "Three Skills" – being able to recognize, speak, and write characters. Adults have rich vocabularies and life struggle experiences, and the ability to use words to explain a matter or a principle. Therefore, after they master writing, it is not difficult for them to use characters to express what they want to say. Student Liu Xiulan said: "I have a lot to say, and when I think of using those characters, those characters jump out, and I write a long piece!" Student Xu Yong did not find it difficult to write about his own experience (about seven or eight hundred words). However, if students cannot recognize, speak, and write 2,000 characters, it will lead to a situation of "having something to say, but having no characters to write." One experimental class spent 14 hours on writing instruction (only copying twice), and then moved on to writing. As a result, students spent one or two days writing an article of about 200 words; in order to find a character, they flipped through books and checked character tables everywhere, and even stood at the door to ask primary school students. When they finally found the character, they forgot what they wanted to say. This greatly reduced students' interest and confidence in writing. Sometimes, students avoid difficulties because they cannot write a character, and simply omit the entire sentence. It is not enough to only be able to recognize, speak, and write 2,000 characters, because the workers and peasants have just mastered writing, and writing is still an unfamiliar thing for them; therefore, before conducting writing instruction, the meaning of characters should be expanded, words and sentences should be understood thoroughly, and some popular books and newspapers should be read during intensive reading of textbooks, so that students can obtain more social science knowledge, initially enrich their ideological content, and expand their ideological scope. Otherwise, they will not be able to accurately use characters, words, and sentences when writing.

Conduct Ideological Mobilization Before Writing

Due to the influence of old writing ideas, students are not confident in practicing writing at the beginning. They think that "writing articles is a matter for educated people" and "how can a rough person write articles after studying for three months?" They also heard that "writing articles must have literary talent, with rhymes, and colloquial language cannot form an article." Student Ma Dewang wrote a letter to the teacher, and just wrote "Dear Teacher: I...", when an old gentleman next door saw it and told him that he had to write "Dear Teacher Junjian Jingqizhe..." Therefore, he never dared to write again, and even if he wrote it, he didn't believe it was an article. Student Wu Guiqing was able to read books and newspapers, and wrote a letter to Chairman Mao with heartfelt gratitude, but she hid it and didn't want to show it to anyone. After the teacher discovered it, she submitted the manuscript to the New China Women's Magazine, and it was published. She still didn't believe it, saying that what she wrote was not an article; therefore, teachers must constantly criticize incorrect ideas about writing to students during the writing teaching process, and repeatedly explain that writing articles is the same as speaking, and how to speak is how to write articles.

To establish students' writing ideology, we must first start with correcting teachers' writing ideology. Some teachers believe that articles must be processed and the diction must be gorgeous, so students write "brightly dazzling," and teachers change it to "radiant." Teachers with lower levels of education believe that writing articles is not easy, difficult to write, and have no confidence in guiding students. We should gradually instill writing ideas in students from the intensive reading stage, use colloquial articles as examples, and explain that writing articles is the same as writing. After the writing instruction begins, Gao Yubao's writing experience should be introduced to them so that they have a correct understanding of writing. We can also launch a "must write when you have something to say" movement, allowing students to write down what they want to say. Or, use the method of cultivating typical examples and focusing on breakthroughs to help one or two students to better explain a theme with words, let him say it in class, and the teacher writes it on the blackboard, explaining that this is an article. For example, a teacher in Gaobeidian first helped Yang Yufang, who had the worst grades, to write a letter, read it aloud in class, and praised her. Everyone said, "Even Yang Yufang can write, can't I write?" Wang Xiaofeng, a teacher at the staff and workers' spare-time school, assigned the group leader of the counseling group to launch a note-passing movement in the class. I write you a note to borrow a knife, and you write him a note to agree on the time to review the homework. In this way, writing gradually develops from one or two sentences to writing paragraphs. Some run "writing" wall newspapers, posting students' writing to encourage them. These are all good ways to break through the "dare not write" barrier.

Writing Should Be Carried Out in Conjunction with Intensive Reading of Texts and Extensive Reading of Popular Books and Newspapers

In order to guide students' writing and continuously improve their writing ability, writing instruction should be carried out in conjunction with explaining writing knowledge, reading model essays, and reading popular books and newspapers. Through this activity, students understand the basic methods of writing: such as articles should have a center, the structure should be clear, and the content should be specific and clear. Then, in a large number of reading popular books and newspapers, they can understand these principles and gradually apply them to the practice of writing. For example, when learning to write letters, on the one hand, explain the format and key points, and on the other hand, select and read letters from labor models to Chairman Mao published in newspapers and magazines; in this way, students can learn from others' writing methods and improve their own writing.

Adults accept writing knowledge relatively quickly. For example, when explaining that writing articles should grasp the characteristics, we intensively read Wei Wei's "Who Are the Most Lovable People" Comrade Ma Yuxiang, so that students understand that there are many heroic deeds of the volunteers. As long as the heroic deeds of Comrade Ma Yuxiang rescuing Korean children from the fire are used, it can explain the volunteers' noble internationalist spirit. They are the most lovable people. When writing the news report "The Sixth Cultural Center Accelerated Experimental Class Graduated", let the students record the success story of Li Ruiying overcoming difficulties in learning. After Ma Shuxia read Gao Yubao's "How Did I Learn Culture and Writing?", she considered the center, structure, and characteristics of this article and imitated it to write an autobiography: "When I was thirteen years old, I went to take the primary school exam. The teacher said that I was too old, and if I was with the first-grade children, it would be like camels running among the sheep... In the old society, poor people could not go to school..."

When explaining writing methods, the principle of dispersing difficulties, gradually occupying, and linking one link to another should be followed. Do not teach all the students at once; use the method of focusing on explanation and guiding reading, and through the activity of guiding writing with reading, conduct explanation, and expand extensive and massive reading in a planned, step-by-step, and led manner according to specific circumstances, so that students can quickly improve their writing level through continuous study, experience, and practice.

Help Students Overcome Difficulties and Open Up Ideas

The difficulties in writing for students mostly arise from a lack of writing habits. Therefore, before writing, students should practice listening to and writing phrases, sentences, and paragraphs. The teacher dictates and the students write, or the students conduct each other, you say, I write, I say, you write, and finally transition to saying and writing by themselves. The main difficulty in writing is not knowing what can be written and what cannot be written, what to write first and what to write later, how to start and how to end. They say, "If the beginning is not good, it is impossible to write below." "If you give me a start, I will continue to write." After starting to write, some people do not know where to say. Some complain that they do not know where to end the writing, and what they write is mostly simple and general. For example, Tan Huamin has decades of life experience, and it takes several hours to say, but it takes only a few words to write. Therefore, the teacher should preferably use the question and answer method to help students write. For example, ask the student "What is your name?" The student writes "My name is ×××". The teacher asks sentence by sentence: "How old are you this year?" "Where do you live?" "What do you do?" "How was your life before liberation? Are you literate?" The students answer sentence by sentence, and they are connected into an article, such as "My name is Wang Jin, I am twenty-four years old this year, I live in Liulitun Village, I have been farming since I was a child, I was illiterate before liberation, and my life was very hard..."

After several question-and-answer writing exercises, the teacher can gradually reduce his activities, only give students a beginning, and let the students write down; when students feel that they have nothing to say or write vaguely, they should be enlightened to help them expand their ideas. For example, when Wang Bin wrote about the situation of catching locusts, he only said, "This morning I went to Mashin Temple Hougou to fight locusts..." The teacher enlightened him and told him: "You only say to fight locusts, but people don't know what's going on. You must explain clearly why you want to fight locusts? How to fight?" He added these contents, and the teacher told him that he should explain the achievements: "How many people participated? How many were killed? What is the significance of fighting them for increasing the yield per unit area and the patriotic bumper harvest movement?"

In addition, students can also be organized to discuss before writing: What to write? How to write? For example, when writing "I participated in the May Day parade", after discussion, everyone knew that they could write how to prepare, how to go, what they saw on the road, what they heard, what they thought in their hearts, how they came back, and so on. On this basis, they are gradually guided to write composition outlines to cultivate their independent thinking and organizational skills. At the beginning, they can generally only write two or three items, but slowly they can write more detailed outlines. For example, when Jin Chongxin wrote "Wang Lizhen, Fifty-Two Years Old", he wrote such an outline: his history, the situation of being oppressed, the situation after liberation, the learning process, and the ending. In this way, the articles written are also well-organized, clear and understandable.

Some teachers are eager for quick success and write outlines for students, resulting in the phenomenon of answering questions. Some teachers tell students too specifically how to write. These are all inappropriate. Because what the teacher thinks, understands, and experiences is inconsistent with the students' thoughts, it hinders the development of their own ideas, and the teacher becomes a "big crutch." The things written in this way are all the same and lack content.

When starting to practice writing, it is best not to strictly limit the time, so that students can fully think freely and delve into their thoughts. Students said: "The teacher is in a hurry, and my heart is flustered. The more I am afraid of not finishing writing, the more I can't write. The upper sentence doesn't match the lower sentence, and I forget the strokes of the characters." As writing becomes more proficient, students' writing speed will gradually increase. At this time, the teacher can propose the slogan "Good and Fast". In writing after class, plagiarism by students should be prevented. For example, one student copied his brother's article and wrote "Uncle Qi Jianhua...", the teacher should seize this kind of fact to educate the students, explaining that copying other people's things is not good for oneself.

Specifically Help Students Find Materials

Adults have relatively rich life experiences, but when they start writing, they often do not know which materials are valuable and should be written, and which materials are not valuable and do not need to be written. If the teacher does not help them determine a range, they often cannot grasp the center, forming an accumulation of materials, from learning to production, and from production to going to the market. If it is something familiar to the students, a relatively simple and specific problem, it is easier to write, such as writing their own history, learning experience, our mutual aid group... When female students in Dongba wrote "Comparison of New and Old Marriages", they said: "I have personally seen my mother-in-law beat her daughter-in-law with a rolling pin, and I have also tasted the pain of the old marriage." Therefore, they are all written very vividly. However, when they encounter more complicated problems, they feel very difficult to write. For example, when writing "Thoughts on May Day", the students did not know how to write. Yang Zhishan said: "When I arrived at Tiananmen Square, I saw Chairman Mao, and I also saw international friends and the parade. What should I write? How should I write it!" When students in Gaobeidian wrote letters to their brothers, sisters, teachers, and district chiefs, they were all very fluent, but when they wrote letters to labor models, they were stunned because there were no specific objects. They said they didn't know who to write to.

Adults each have their own life experiences. Teachers must determine the subject matter based on their experiences and in light of their thoughts and feelings. It is best to give several topics so that students can write according to their different experiences.

After the students have a certain foundation, the teacher can enlighten the students to determine the subject matter themselves. Launch every student to find a material for writing, report it in class, and evaluate and compare it together, so that they can clarify which materials should be selected and which materials are not valuable. Later, the teacher will no longer give topics, and let the students discuss in groups, jointly study and determine the topics, and finally transition to the way of finding materials independently and freely. At this time, the teacher can propose the slogan "Diligent hands, diligent eyes, diligent brains, diligent ears, diligent legs", launch the students to pay attention to new things, and cultivate the habit of writing drafts to consolidate teaching achievements.

Whether the teacher gives the topic or the students find the materials themselves, it should be combined with the students' life, production, thoughts, and feelings, combined with current affairs and the current central work.

How to Revise Homework

Students urgently require that they can write well, so they welcome teachers to correct their homework. But they all have self-esteem. If the homework is revised messily, they often become inferior, so the teacher must make appropriate revisions. Starting from the students' level, respect the students' meaning, do not change if you can, and never change more if you can change less. Give more praise for their advantages and less criticism for their shortcomings. When revising, it is best to make a mark or propose a correction opinion, let the students do it themselves to correct, and those that cannot be corrected by the group will help each other to correct, and finally the teacher will review it. The teacher should focus on helping students with poor writing, study and correct it with him, and if there are common problems, they should be raised for everyone to discuss and collectively modify.

When correcting wrong characters, teachers should not take care of everything. You can attach a correction table of wrong characters on the back of the student's homework book, and let the students correct it themselves; and record the number of wrong characters to arouse the students' attention. If there are common examples, they can be corrected on the blackboard, analyzed and compared. After several such corrections, the students' wrong characters can be greatly reduced. The main reason for the wrong characters is the poor writing foundation. The wrong characters are because the analysis of the glyphs was not done well during the sudden rush of new characters, the explanation of the meaning of the characters was not appropriate, and there was a lack of intensive reading in the reading. Jin Yukuan said: "I can never remember the word '感' (gan, feeling). I remember it as the word '赶' (gan, hurry)." Liu Zengquan took "治" (zhi, to govern) as "志" (zhi, will), so the composition appeared "鸡会" (jihui, chicken meeting, meaning opportunity) and "布书负" (bushufu, cloth book negative, meaning uncomfortable) and other wrong characters. Some students find it difficult to distinguish between words such as "使" (shi, to make) and "便" (bian, then), "脸" (lian, face) and "验" (yan, test). Some students are confused when using words, so they use homophones to replace them. If the pronunciation, glyph, and meaning of the word are accurately occupied, wrong characters generally do not occur much.

In modifying homework, teachers should thoroughly criticize the old teaching ideas that do not believe in the strong comprehension and judgment of adults. In fact, if students read it twice more, read it twice more, and think about it more, they can generally revise it themselves. For example, a student wrote "When I was thirteen years old, my mother told me to go to school, so I went." The teacher asked him to read it two or three times, and he removed the two "I" characters and changed it to "When I was thirteen years old, my mother told me to go to school, so I went."

In addition, we must prevent the impetuous mood of demanding too much. Appropriately put forward requirements according to the law of students' writing development. For example, when students do not dare to write boldly, it is best not to make any criticisms, only praise the advantages, so that they can build confidence and encourage them to write more. When they can write hundreds of words, the teacher gradually has to require a center and a clear structure. Later, step by step, it is required to write specifically and vividly. It is absolutely impossible to put forward inappropriate requirements too early.

    怎样进行写话教学
    北京东郊区识字运动委员会办公室
    写话教学是速成识字教学中的重要阶段，它和精读课文、阅读通俗读物等教学活动相辅进行，约占全部教学时间的三分之一左右。比如我们的市民班整个教学及复习用去三百四十七个小时，而写话教学就占了一百四十小时。经过这段教学，要求学员能写三、五百字（个别的到一千字以上）的书信、日记等日常应用文及一般的记述文、说明文（部分学员要能写通讯）。
    打好写话教学的基础
    写话教学需要在“三会”—会认、会讲、会写的巩固的基础上进行。成人具有丰富的语汇和生活斗争经验，有用话说明一件事或一个道理的能力，所以在他们掌握文字以后，用字来表达自己要说的话，并不怎么困难。学员柳秀兰说：“我一肚子话，想到用那几个字，那几个字就跳出来了，一写就一大篇！”学员徐镛写自己的经历时（约七、八百字）并不费劲。但是如果学员还不能会认、会讲、会写二千个字，就会形成“有话可说，无字可写”了。有个实验班用十四小时进行写字教学以后（仅抄写了两遍），就转入写话，结果学员写一篇二百来字的文章，要用一两天工夫；为了找一个字，到处翻书、查字表，甚至站到门口问小学生。好容易找着字了，话却又忘了。这样就大大降低了学员的写作兴趣和信心。有时，学员因为一个字不会写，竟避难就易，把整句话略去。仅仅会认、会讲、会写两千个字还不行，因为工农劳动人民刚刚掌握文字，写话对他们说来还是一件生疏的事；所以在进行写话教学以前，应在精读课本时扩大字义，弄通词句，并阅读一些通俗书报，使学员取得较多的社会科学知识，初步充实思想内容，扩展思想领域。否则写起来就不能确当地运用字、词、句。
    写话前要进行思想动员
    学员们由于受到旧写作思想的影响，开始时对练习写作的信心是不足的。他们认为“写文章是有学问的人的事”、“一个大老粗，念了三个月的书，那会写文章呢？”他们还听说“写文章得有文词，有辙有韵，土言土语不成文。”学员马德旺给老师写信，刚写了“贺老师：我……”，邻居一个老先生看了，就告诉他得写成“贺老师钧鉴敬启者……”因此他再也不敢下笔了，即使写出来也不相信就算文章。学员吴桂清能看书报以后，怀着衷心感谢毛主席的心情，给毛主席写了一封信，但是她把它藏起来了，不愿给人看。教师发现以后，给她把稿子投到新中国妇女杂志社，刊登出来了，她还不信，说自己写的不成话；因此教师必须在写话教学过程中向学员经常批判对写作的不正确思想，反复地说明写文章和说话是一回事，话怎样说，文章就怎样写。
    树立学员的写话思想，首先要从端正教师的写作思想做起。有的教师认为文章必得加工，词藻要华丽，因而学生写“亮的照眼”，教师给改成“光辉夺目”。文化程度较低的教师，认为写文章不简单，难写，没有信心指导学生。我们应从细读阶段就逐步灌输学员以写话思想，用口语化的文章做范例，说明写文章和写话是一回事。写话教学开始后，要把高玉宝的习作经验介绍给他们，使他们对写话有个正确的认识。我们也可以开展一个“有话必写”的运动，让同学把要说的话用笔写出来。或者用培养典型、重点突破的办法帮助一两个学员能较好地用话说明一个主题，让他在课堂上说出来，由教师记在黑板上，说明这就是文章。譬如高碑店有一位老师先帮助成绩最差的杨玉芳写了一封信，在课堂上朗读一下，加以表扬。大家说：“连杨玉芳都能写，我还不能写吗？”职工业余学校教师王晓峰布置辅导员小组长在班中展开一个传条运动，我给你写条借小刀，你给他写条约定温习功课的时间，这样由写一两句话逐渐发展到写成段的话。有的办“写话”墙报，把学员写的话张贴出来进行鼓动。这些都是突破“不敢写”这一关的较好办法。
    写话要和精读课文大量阅读
    通俗书报相辅进行
    为了指导学员的写话，并不断地提高学员的写话能力，写话教学应和讲解写作知识、读范文以及阅读通俗书报等活动相辅进行，通过这一活动使学员明白写作的基本方法：如文章要有中心，层次要分明，内容要具体明白等。然后在大量阅读通俗书报中使他们体会这些道理，并逐渐地把它们运用到写话的实践中去。如在学习写信时，一方面讲解格式和要点，一方面选读报纸杂志上发表的劳动模范们给毛主席的信；这样学员就能学习别人的写法，改进自己的写话。
    成人接受写作的知识是比较快的，如在讲解写文章要抓特点时，我们精读了魏巍写的“谁是最可爱的人”马玉祥同志，使学员理解到志愿军的英雄事迹很多，只要通过马玉祥同志从烈火中救出朝鲜儿童的英雄事迹，就能说明志愿军崇高的国际主义精神，他们是最可爱的人。在写“第六文化馆速成实验班毕业了”的通讯时，让同学记述李瑞英克服困难学习成功的事迹。马淑霞在看过高玉宝“我是怎样学习文化和学习写作的？”以后，考虑到这篇文章的中心、层次、特点，模仿着写了一篇自传：“在我十三岁的时候去考小学，老师说你岁数大了，跟一年级小孩在一起，就成羊群跑骆驼了……在旧社会里穷人是不能上学的……”
    讲解写作方法时应按照分散难点、逐步占有、一环套一环的原则，不可一股脑儿都教给学员；并用重点讲解、指导阅读的办法，通过以阅读指导写作的活动，依照具体情况有计划有步骤有领导地进行讲解，展开广泛的大量的阅读，使学员从不断的钻研、体验与实践中迅速提高写话水平。
    帮助学员克服困难打开思路
    学员写话的困难多半是由缺乏写作习惯产生的，所以在写话前应该让学员练习听写短语、成句和成段的话，由教师说学生写，或由同学间相互进行，你说我写，我说你写，最后过渡到自己说自己写。写话时主要的困难是不知那些可以写，那些不可以写，先写什么后写什么，怎样开头怎样结尾。他们说：“头起不好，底下就没法写。”“你要给我起个头，我就会接着写了。”写起来以后，有的写着写着就不知该往那儿说了。有的叫苦不知到那儿该收笔，写的东西则大都简单笼统，如谭华民有几十年的生活经历，说起来需要好几个钟头，但写起来却三言两语就完结了。所以教师最好用问答的方式帮助学员写话，如问学生“你叫什么？”学员就写“我叫×××”。教师一句句的问：“今年多大岁数？”“住在那儿？”“干什么？”“解放前生活怎样？识字不？”学生一句句的答出来，就串连成文，如“我叫王金，今年二十四岁，住在六里屯村，从小种地，解放前不识字，生活很苦……”。
    经过几次问答写话的练习，教师就可以逐渐减少自己的活动，只给学生开个头，让学生写下去；在学生觉得没话说或写的笼统时，就要加以启发，帮助他们展开思路。比如王斌写捕蝗虫的情况时，只说“今天早上我到马神庙后沟去打蝗虫……”教师就加以启发，告诉他：“你只说打蝗虫，人家不知是怎么回事，必须说明白为什么要打蝗虫？怎么打的？”他便添上了这些内容，老师又告诉他应该说明成绩：“多少人参加？打了多少？打了以后对提高单位面积产量、爱国丰产运动有什么意义？”
    此外还可以组织学生在写话前进行讨论：写什么？怎么写？如写“我参加了五一节的游行”时，经过讨论后，大家就知道可以写怎么准备，怎么去的，一路上看见什么，听见什么，心里想什么，怎么回来的等等。在这个基础上，再逐渐引导他们写作文提纲，以培养他们的独立思考能力和组织能力。开始时一般只能写出二、三条，但慢慢就能写比较详细的提纲。如金崇新在写“五十二岁的王丽珍”时，写出了这样的提纲：他的历史，受压迫情况，解放后的情形，学习经过，结尾。这样，写出来的文章也就有条有理、清晰明白了。
    有的教师急于求成，替学员写提纲，结果形成答问题的现象。有的教师过于具体地告诉学员如何如何写。这都是不恰当的。因为教师所想的，所理解的，所体会到的，是和学员的思想不一致的，它妨碍了他们自己思路的展开，教师成了“大拐棍”。这样写出来的东西，千篇一律，内容贫乏。
    开始练习写话时，最好不要严格地限制时间，使学生能充分地自由思索，深入思想。学员们说：“老师一催心就慌了，越怕写不完就越写不出来，说了上言没下语，字也忘了笔划。”随着写话的熟练，学员写的速度会逐渐增加，这时教师可以提出“又好又快”的口号。在课后写话要防止学员的抄袭现象，如有一个学员抄了他弟弟的文章，写成“祁建华叔叔……”，教师应抓住这类事实对学生进行教育，说明照抄别人的东西对自己是没有好处的。
    具体帮助学员找材料
    成人的生活经验比较丰富，但开始写话时往往不知那些材料有价值应该写，那些材料没价值不必写。如果教师不帮助他们确定一个范围，就往往抓不着中心，形成材料的堆砌，由学习扯到生产，又由生产扯到赶集。如果是学员所熟习的事物，比较简单具体的问题，写起来比较容易，如写自己的历史、学习经过、我们的互助小组……。东坝妇女学员写“新旧婚姻的对比”时，她们说：“我亲眼看过婆婆用赶面杖打媳妇，自己也尝过旧婚姻的痛苦。”因此写得都非常生动。但是当他们碰到比较复杂的问题，写起来就感觉非常困难。如写“五一节的感想”时，学员们都不知怎么写，杨志山说：“一到天安门我见了毛主席，又见了国际友人和游行队伍，我写那样啊？怎么写呀！”高碑店学员给兄弟、姐妹、老师、区长写信时，都很流畅，但给劳动模范们写信，由于没有具体对象就愣住了。他们说不知写给谁。
    成人各自有各自的生活经验，教师必须根据他们的经验，针对他们的思想感情确定题材。最好多出几个题目，让学员可以根据各自不同的体会来写。
    在学员具有一定的基础以后，教师就可以启发学员自己确定题材。发动每一个学员找一个写话的材料，在课堂上报告出来，共同评议比较，使他们明确那些材料是应该选取的，那些材料是没价值的。以后教师就不再出题目，让学员在小组讨论，共同研究确定题目，最后过渡到独立地自由地找材料的方式。这时教师可以提出“手勤、眼勤、脑勤、耳勤、腿勤”的号召，发动学员注意新鲜事物，培养写稿习惯，以巩固教学成绩。
    无论教师出题目或学生自己找材料，都应结合学员的生活、生产、思想、感情，结合时事及当前的中心工作。
    如何修改作业
    学员们迫切要求自己能写的好，所以他们欢迎老师批改他们的作业。但他们都有自尊心，要是作业被改得乱七八糟，往往自卑起来，所以教师必须加以适当的修改。从学员的水平出发，尊重学员的意思，能不改的就不改，能少改的决不多改。多发扬他们的优点少批评缺点。修改时最好能作出记号，或提出改正意见，让学员自己动手去改，改不了的由小组互助改正，最后由老师审核。对写话较差的学员，教师应重点帮助，和他一块研究改正，如有普遍性的问题就提出来，让大家讨论，集体修改。
    纠正错别字，教师也不要包办代替。可以在学生作文本的后面附上错别字订正表，让学员自行订正；并记出错别的次数，以引起学员的重视。如果有共同性的例子，可在黑板上订正，加以分析和比较，经过几次这样的校正，学员的错别字就可大大减少。错字产生的原因，主要是写字基础差。别字则是由于在突击生字时没有很好地分析字形，字义的讲解不够确当，阅读中又缺乏精读细读。金玉宽说：“我记‘感’字时总记不住，我把它当作赶快的‘赶’字记下来了。”刘增泉拿“治”当作同志的“志”，所以作文中就出现了“鸡会”（机会），“布书负”（不舒服）等别字。有的学员难于区别“使”和“便”、“脸”和“验”等字。有的学员用字时蒙住了，就用同音字来代替。如果字音、字形、字义占有的确切，错别字一般发生的不多。
    在修改作业上，教师应彻底批判不相信成人理解力、判断力强的旧教学思想。事实上学员如果多看两遍，多念两遍，多想一想，一般是能够自行修改的。如有一个学员写“我十三岁时，我母亲叫我上学，我就去了。”教师就让他念了二、三次，他就去掉了两个“我”字，而改成“十三岁时，母亲叫我上学，我就去了。”
    此外要防止要求过高的急躁情绪。根据学员写话发展的规律适当地提出要求，如学员还不敢大胆写话时，最好不提出任何批评，只表扬优点，使他们树立信心，鼓励他们多写，当他们能够写上百把字了，教师逐渐地就得要求有中心、分层次了，以后一步步地要求写的具体生动。万不可过早地提出不适当的要求。
