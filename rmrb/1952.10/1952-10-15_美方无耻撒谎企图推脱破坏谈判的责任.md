Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 14th: As the Korean-Chinese side has exposed the U.S. side's plot to deliberately sabotage the armistice negotiations and expand the war, the American aggressors are now rushing to deny and cover up their despicable intentions. But in the face of the facts, they have no other way but to lie.

    According to a United Press Washington dispatch of October 11, the U.S. State Department "flatly denied" the accusation made by General Nan Ri in his October 11 protest that the U.S. side was plotting to force the United Nations General Assembly to endorse the expansion of the war in Korea. In fact, the U.S. government's plot to force other countries in the United Nations General Assembly to endorse the expansion of the war in Korea has long been publicly promoted in American newspapers to the point of reeking. The "New York Times" of October 5 stated it very clearly. The paper said that the U.S.'s "preliminary plan stipulates that Secretary of State Acheson will unveil a general proposal after the UN General Assembly opens, calling on the communist side to agree to a Korean armistice. If this resolution does not produce results—and there is little hope that it will—it is expected that the U.S. will put forward a second, tougher proposal, demanding that the General Assembly explicitly reiterate the UN's support for the U.S. position in Panmunjom." The U.S. "National Guardian Weekly" of October 2 revealed it even more clearly. It said: "Washington is clearly under pressure from its allies and its own people to conclude a truce agreement." It said that the U.S. strategy is: if the Korean-Chinese side rejects those apparently unacceptable proposals, "Washington has a way out." Washington's way out is: "1. Orchestrate all our peace rhetoric to influence the election; 2. Whip reluctant UN members to support a 'full-scale' war in Korea." What is particularly absurd and shameless is that the spokesperson for the U.S. State Department tried hard to avoid mentioning the new proposal from the Korean-Chinese side. But the whole world already knows about the new suggestions from the Korean-Chinese side and knows that the U.S. chief negotiator, Harrison, refused to discuss this new suggestion and, after reading a pre-prepared statement sabotaging the negotiations, withdrew from the meeting without waiting for the Korean-Chinese side to speak. In order to distort this fact, the official U.S. propaganda organ, the United States Information Service, on the 13th, in the name of so-called "qualified observers," cited the minutes of the negotiation meeting and made the most shameless lies. These so-called "qualified observers" quoted General Nan Ri's speech at the negotiating session on the 8th out of context, deliberately omitting the part where the Korean-Chinese side adopted the U.S. side's opinion, which said: "We believe that all prisoners of war on both sides can be sent to the agreed exchange location in the demilitarized zone after the armistice agreement takes effect to be received by the other party, and then, after visits by the joint group of Red Cross Societies on both sides, ensure that these prisoners of war return home to live a peaceful life and no longer participate in the Korean War…" These observers said that after General Nan Ri finished speaking, the U.S. chief negotiator Harrison only said four sentences. It was only after the Korean-Chinese side insisted on "forcible repatriation" that Harrison announced the adjournment of the meeting. They said: "Apart from the four sentences that General Harrison said earlier in the meeting, the entire meeting was left to the communist negotiators to speak." They said: "This is enough to answer the communist side's attack today that they did not get a chance to speak."

    These so-called "qualified observers" portrayed themselves as a poor "innocent lamb," but the meeting minutes precisely exposed the true face of this wolf in sheep's clothing. The meeting minutes prove that Harrison said far more than four sentences at the meeting on the 8th, even more than a hundred sentences! Harrison read a long statement that had been prepared long ago at the meeting, and this statement was published in full by the Associated Press on the 8th with a Wonsan dateline. At the end of this statement, Harrison said: "I have nothing more to say. Because your side has not put forward any constructive suggestions, our side proposes to adjourn the meeting." After saying this, Harrison quickly left the meeting and fled without waiting for our side to speak. Why didn't Washington's "qualified observers" dare to mention Harrison's lengthy statement that had been prepared long ago? Why didn't they clarify that Harrison left the meeting immediately after issuing this statement? Where was the so-called "opportunity to speak" given to our side? In the end, Washington's so-called "qualified observers" are just a bunch of low-energy liars. Not only have they failed to absolve the U.S. government of the responsibility for sabotaging the armistice negotiations, but they have also made their unsightly and sinister faces even clearer to the world with their attempts to cover up the truth.

    美方无耻撒谎企图推脱破坏谈判的责任
    【新华社开城十四日电】由于朝中方面揭露了美方蓄意破坏停战谈判扩大战争的阴谋，美国侵略者现在急忙出来矢口否认和掩饰他们的卑鄙意图。可是在事实面前，他们除了说谎以外，什么办法也没有。
    据合众社华盛顿十一日电报道，美国国务院“干脆地否认”了南日将军在十月十一日抗议中所提出的美方阴谋迫使联合国大会赞同扩大侵朝战争的指责。事实上，美国政府想在联合国大会上强迫其他国家赞同扩大侵朝战争的阴谋，早在美国的报纸上公开宣传得臭气薰天了。十月五日的“纽约时报”就说得很清楚。该报说，美国的“初步计划决定由国务卿艾奇逊在联大揭幕以后就提出一项一般性提案，号召共方同意朝鲜停战。如果这项决议并不产生效果——这项决议很少希望会产生效果——那末预期美国将提出第二个更为强硬的提案，要求大会明确重申联合国支持美国在板门店的立场”。十月二日的美国“国民前卫周刊”揭露得尤为明白。它说：“华盛顿显然处在它的盟国及它自己的人民要求缔结休战协议的压力之下。”它说，美国的战略是：如果朝中方面拒绝了那些显然不能被接受的方案，“华盛顿就有办法了。”华盛顿的办法是：“一、把我们全部关于和平的花言巧语组织起来，以便影响大选；二、鞭策不情愿的联合国会员以支持一个在朝鲜的‘全力’战争。”尤其荒谬无耻的是：美国国务院的发言人竭力避免提起朝中方面的新提案。可是全世界已经知道了朝中方面的新建议，而且知道美方谈判首席代表哈利逊拒绝讨论这个新建议，并在宣读事先准备好的破坏谈判的声明以后，不等朝中方面发言，迳自退出会场。为了歪曲这一事实，美国官方宣传机关美国新闻处在十三日以所谓“有资格观察家们”的名义，引述谈判会议记录，作了最无耻的撒谎。这些所谓“有资格的观察家们”断章取义地引述了南日将军在八日谈判大会上的发言，故意不提朝中方面采纳美方意见的部分，这一部分说：“我们认为双方全部战俘在停战协定生效后，可一律送至非军事区内双方协议的交换地点交给对方接收，然后经过双方红十字会联合小组的访问，保证这些战俘回家过和平生活，不再参加朝鲜战争……。”这些观察家说，在南日将军发言完毕以后，美方谈判首席代表哈利逊只说了四句话。只是在朝中方面坚持“强迫遣返”之后，哈利逊才宣布休会。他们说：“除了哈利逊将军在会议较早时候说过的这四句话而外，整个会议都是让共方谈判代表发言。”他们说：“这就足够回答共方今天说他们没有获得发言机会的攻击了。”
    这些所谓“有资格的观察家们”把自己装扮得真像一只可怜的“无罪的羔羊”，可是会议记录恰恰是暴露了这只披着羊皮的狼的真面目。会议记录证明，哈利逊在八日会议上讲的岂但不止四句话，就是一百句也不止！哈利逊在会上宣读了一篇早就准备好了的长篇声明，这篇声明并且由美联社在八日用汶山的电头全文发表。在这篇声明的末了，哈利逊说：“我已再没有什么可说的了。因为你方没有提出任何建设性的建议，所以我方主张休会。”说完这句话，哈利逊不等我方发言，就赶紧离开会场，逃之夭夭。华盛顿的“有资格的观察家们”为什么不敢提到哈利逊这篇早就准备好了的冗长声明呢？他们为什么不肯说清楚哈利逊是在发表了这通声明以后立刻离开会场的呢？给我方的所谓“发言机会”又在什么地方呢？说到最后，华盛顿的所谓“有资格的观察家们”，不过是一帮低能的说谎家而已。他们不但没有能够给美国政府卸脱破坏停战谈判的责任，反而欲盖弥彰地使全世界更加看清楚了他们的见不得人的阴险嘴脸。
