Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 17th. The French newspaper "l'Humanité" published a lengthy news article on October 11th, headlined "Three Witnesses Confirm U.S. Germ Warfare Crimes," reporting on a mass meeting held at the Salle Pleyel in Paris on October 10th. At this meeting, international scientific committee member Martel, International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team member Jascay, and French National Peace Council chairman Faggi each presented reports on the findings of the international scientific committee's investigation.

The meeting was presided over by Joliot-Curie, chairman of the World Peace Council. In his opening remarks, he emphasized that among all major powers, the United States is the only country that has not ratified the Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons, and its army is conducting germ warfare in Korea.

Joliot-Curie said: "I have long known that the United States was preparing to use these weapons, so when the germ warfare was first announced, I was not at all surprised."

Joliot-Curie then mentioned the report issued by the International Scientific Commission. He said: "Now, the most important thing is to make these documents known to everyone, to spread these documents widely. Everyone should face this reality, should recognize that if these things that have started in China and Korea are not immediately stopped by an irresistible force of public opinion, then tomorrow each of us and our dearest relatives will become victims of these terrible means of destruction.

Joliot-Curie said, "Any scientist who is aware of his responsibility should strive for science to serve the welfare of mankind, not to destroy it; they should be the most active in striving to eliminate this method of destruction. Obviously, this is not just a matter for scientists. Only when broad public opinion sees clearly what is right and wrong and promotes mass action can this goal be achieved."

Jascay then gave a report, which was listened to with great attention by the audience. He said that on scientific issues, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team investigated cases that had been confirmed, and was able to personally question witnesses who had seen planes fly over and personally discovered containers, insects, or other suspicious objects.

Jascay cited some of the cases studied by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team, and announced that they were convinced that the U.S. military's use of bacteriological weapons was a fact. In this situation, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team has a responsibility to publish its findings, because knowing these things and remaining silent is tantamount to participating in these crimes.

Professor Martel then spoke, spending more than an hour scientifically and meticulously explaining the methods used by the committee to conduct the investigation. He pointed out that the International Scientific Committee finally unanimously concluded that the accusations of germ warfare had been established.

Professor Martel said that later, the committee agreed on an appropriate method of analysis and began to investigate some cases. They selected a total of five cases to study. The committee's work was to study some bacteriological warfare activities that had been undoubtedly determined. The research was conducted both in the laboratory and in the field. They questioned hundreds of witnesses.

Then Martel cited some irrefutable evidence of these established cases. He concluded with a rigorous scientific attitude that germ warfare is a fact; the actions in Korea and China are experimental, aimed at preparing for larger-scale actions. This method of warfare creates the possibility of astonishing destruction.

Martel called on all upright people to unite more closely and jointly strive for the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

Faggi spoke last at the meeting. He emphasized that the U.S. government is currently obstructing the exchange of prisoners of war in Korea, perhaps because it fears that the prisoners will expose more facts about the U.S. military's use of bacteriological weapons.

On the presidium of the meeting were Mrs. Gordon, Professor Hadamard, Professor Aubert, Casanova, and other famous scientists and French social celebrities.

    马戴尔、贾斯盖和法奇在巴黎群众大会上
    宣布美国政府进行细菌战的罪证
    约里奥—居里号召动员舆论制止美国罪行
    【新华社布拉格十七日电】法国“人道报”十月十一日以“三位证人证实了美国的细菌战罪行”为标题，发表了一条很长的新闻，报道十月十日在巴黎普列叶大厅举行的一次群众大会。在这次会上，国际科学委员会委员马戴尔，国际民主法律工作者协会调查团团员贾斯盖和法国全国和平理事会主席法奇分别就国际科学委员会的调查结果作了报告。
    大会由世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里主持。他在致开幕词中强调指出，在所有大国当中，美国是唯一没有批准关于禁止使用化学武器和细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的国家，它的军队正在朝鲜进行细菌战。
    约里奥—居里说：“我早就知道美国在准备使用这些武器，因此当细菌战的事刚刚发表的时候，我一点也不觉得惊奇。”
    约里奥—居里接着提到国际科学委员会发表的报告。他说：“现在，最重要的是应该让每一个人都知道这些文件，让这些文件广泛地传布。每一个人都应该正视这个现实，应该认识到，假如在中国和朝鲜开了头的这些事情不马上用不可抗拒的舆论力量来加以制止，那么明天我们每一个人和我们最亲爱的亲人都将会成为这恐怖的毁灭手段的牺牲者。
    约里奥—居里说，“任何觉悟到自己的责任的科学家都应该努力争取科学为人类的福利服务，而不是用来毁灭；他们应该在大家之先最积极地争取消除这种毁灭的方法。显然，这也不单是科学家的事情。唯有广大的舆论都看清了是非，促成了群众的行动，才能达到这个目标。”
    贾斯盖接着作报告，受到听众非常注意的倾听。他说，在有关科学的问题上，国际民主法律工作者协会调查团调查了已经确证的案件，并能亲自讯问那些亲眼看见飞机飞过，亲自发现容器、昆虫或其他可疑物件的证人。
    贾斯盖引述了国际民主法律工作者协会调查团研究过的某些事例，并宣布他们确信美军使用细菌武器是确有其事的。在这种情况之下，国际民主法律工作者协会调查团有责任发表它的调查结果，因为如果知道这些事情而仍然默不作声，那就等于参与了这些罪恶行为。
    马戴尔教授接着发言，他花了一个多钟头，科学地精密地讲解委员会进行调查的方法，他指出，国际科学委员会最后一致得出结论：关于细菌战的指责已经确立。
    马戴尔教授说，以后，委员会商定了一个适当的分析方法，便着手调查一些案例。他们共选了五个案例来研究，委员会的工作是对一些已经毫无疑问地确定了的细菌战活动进行研究，研究工作有在实验室里进行的，也有在田野里进行的。他们讯问过好几百名证人。
    接着马戴尔就这些已经确定的案例举出了一些无可辩驳的证据。他以严谨的科学态度作结论说：细菌战是一个事实；在朝鲜和中国的行动是实验性的，目的在于准备更大规模的行动。这种战争方法造成了惊人的毁灭的可能。
    马戴尔号召一切正直的人民更紧密地团结起来，共同争取禁止细菌武器、化学武器和其他大规模毁灭的武器。
    法奇在会上最后发言。他强调指出，美国政府目前在朝鲜阻挠双方交换战俘，这也许是因为它害怕俘虏们会暴露出更多的关于美国军队使用细菌武器的事实。
    大会主席台上有戈登夫人、哈达马教授、奥伯尔教授、卡桑诺伐及其他著名科学家和法国社会名流。
