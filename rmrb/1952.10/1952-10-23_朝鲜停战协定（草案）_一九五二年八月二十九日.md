The undersigned, the Commander-in-Chief of the Korean People’s Army and the Commander of the Chinese People’s Volunteers on one side, and the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command on the other side, in order to stop the Korean conflict that has caused great suffering and bloodshed to both sides, and with the aim of establishing an armistice sufficient to guarantee the complete cessation of hostilities and all armed actions in Korea, pending the achievement of a final peaceful settlement, hereby severally, jointly, and mutually agree to accept and be bound by the terms and conditions of the armistice contained in the following clauses, which are purely military in nature and apply only to the belligerent parties in Korea.

Article I Military Demarcation Line and Demilitarized Zone

1.  It is agreed to establish a military demarcation line, from which both sides shall withdraw two kilometers to establish a demilitarized zone between the opposing armed forces. It is further agreed to establish a demilitarized zone as a buffer zone to prevent incidents that may lead to a resumption of hostilities.

2.  The location of the military demarcation line is as shown on the attached map (see Annex 1). The military demarcation line is described by terrain features and coordinates listed in Annex A.

3.  The demilitarized zone is determined by the northern and southern boundaries shown on the attached map
	(see Annex 1). The northern boundary is described by coordinates listed in Annex B. The southern boundary is described by coordinates listed in Annex C.

4.  The military demarcation line shall be clearly marked as directed by the Military Armistice Commission established below. Commanders of opposing sides shall erect appropriate markers along the boundaries between the demilitarized zone and their respective areas. The Military Armistice Commission shall supervise the erection of all markers set along the military demarcation line and the edges of the demilitarized zone.

5.  The waters of the Han River estuary, where one bank is controlled by one side and the other bank is controlled by the other side, shall be open to civilian navigation by both sides. Navigation rules for the part of the Han River estuary shown in the attached map (see Annex 2) shall be prescribed by the Military Armistice Commission. Civilian navigation by each side shall not be restricted on the land under its military control.

6.  Neither side shall conduct any hostile acts within, from, or towards the demilitarized zone.

7.  No military personnel or civilians shall cross the military demarcation line without the special permission of the Military Armistice Commission.

8.  No military personnel or civilians within the demilitarized zone shall be permitted to enter the area under the military control of either side without the permission of the commander of the area requested to be entered.

Civil administration and relief in the area of the demilitarized zone north of the military demarcation line shall be the joint responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief of the Korean People’s Army and the Commander of the Chinese People’s Volunteers; civil administration and relief in the area of the demilitarized zone south of the military demarcation line shall be the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command. The number of military personnel or civilians permitted to enter the demilitarized zone for civil administration and relief shall be determined by the commanders of each side, but the total number approved by either side shall not exceed one thousand at any time. The number of civil police and the weapons they carry shall be prescribed by the Military Armistice Commission. Other personnel shall not carry weapons without the special permission of the Military Armistice Commission.

11. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as preventing the Military Armistice Commission, its assistants, its joint observer teams and team assistants, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission established below, its assistants, its neutral nations inspection teams and team assistants, and any other personnel, materials, and equipment specifically authorized to enter the demilitarized zone by the Military Armistice Commission from having complete freedom of access to and movement within the demilitarized zone. When two locations within the demilitarized zone cannot be connected by a route entirely within the demilitarized zone, movement through the area under the military control of either side shall be permitted for the route necessary to travel between these two locations.

Article II Specific Arrangements for Ceasefire and Armistice

A. General

12. The commanders of the opposing sides order and guarantee that all armed forces under their control, including all units and personnel of the land, sea, and air forces, shall completely cease all acts of hostility in Korea. This complete cessation of hostilities shall take effect twelve hours after the signing of this Armistice Agreement (for the effective date and time of the remaining provisions of this Armistice Agreement, see Article 63 of this Armistice Agreement).

13. To ensure the stability of the military armistice, and to facilitate the holding by both sides of higher-level political conferences to achieve a peaceful settlement, the commanders of the opposing sides:

	(a)	Except as otherwise provided in this Armistice Agreement, withdraw all their military forces, supplies, and equipment from the demilitarized zone within 72 hours after this Armistice Agreement takes effect, and destroy all fortifications within the demilitarized zone. After the military forces have been withdrawn from the demilitarized zone, the commanders of the armed forces that installed the explosive devices, minefields, barbed wire, and other hazards within the demilitarized zone shall report the existence of these hazards to the Military Armistice Commission. All such hazards shall be removed from the demilitarized zone in accordance with the instructions of the Military Armistice Commission and under its supervision. Thereafter, no personnel from either side shall enter the demilitarized zone except for police forces specifically requested by the Military Armistice Commission and agreed to by the commanders of the opposing sides, and the personnel approved in Article 10 and Article 11 of this Armistice Agreement.

	(b)	Withdraw all their military forces, supplies, and equipment from the rear and coastal islands and waters of the other side in Korea within five days after this Armistice Agreement takes effect. If such military forces fail to withdraw by the deadline, and there is no mutually agreed and valid reason for extending the withdrawal, the other side shall have the right to take any action it deems necessary to maintain order. The term "coastal islands" as used above refers to islands that were occupied by one side at the time this Armistice Agreement takes effect but were controlled by the other side on June 24, 1950; however, all islands north and west of the boundary between Hwanghae Province and Gyeonggi Province shall be placed under the military control of the Commander-in-Chief of the Korean People's Army and the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, with the exception of the islands of Baengnyeongdo (37°58'N, 124°40'E), Daeyeonpyeongdo (37°50'N, 124°42'E), Soyeonpyeongdo (37°46'N, 124°46'E), Yeonpyeongdo (37°38'N, 125°40'E), and Udo (37°36'N, 125°58'E), which shall remain under the military control of the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command. All islands off the west coast of Korea south of the aforementioned boundary shall remain under the military control of the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command (see Annex 3).

	(c)	Cease the introduction into Korea of reinforcing military personnel from outside Korea; however, the rotation of troops and personnel within the limits specified below, the arrival in Korea of personnel on temporary duty, and the return to Korea of personnel after short periods of leave or temporary duty outside Korea shall be permitted.

"Rotation" is defined as the replacement of troops or personnel by other troops or personnel who have commenced service in Korea. Rotation personnel may only enter Korea through the ports listed in Article 43 of this Armistice Agreement. Rotation shall be conducted on a one-for-one basis, but neither side may bring more than 35,000 military personnel into Korea from outside Korea under the rotation policy in any one month. No military personnel from one side may enter Korea if the entry of such military personnel would cause the total number of military personnel from that side who have entered Korea since the effective date of this Armistice Agreement to exceed the cumulative total number of military personnel from that side who have left Korea since that same date. Daily reports shall be submitted to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission regarding the arrival and departure of military personnel in Korea; such reports shall include the location of entry and departure and the number of personnel entering and departing at each location. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, through its neutral nations inspection teams, shall supervise and inspect the aforementioned approved rotation of troops and personnel at the ports listed in Article 43 of this Armistice Agreement.

	(d)	Cease the introduction into Korea of reinforcing combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea; however, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition destroyed or worn out during the armistice may be replaced on a one-for-one basis of the same performance and type. Such combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition may only enter Korea through the ports listed in Article 43 of this Armistice Agreement. To confirm that the combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition imported into Korea for replacement purposes are required, each shipment of such items shall be reported to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission; such report shall state the disposition of the items being replaced. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, through its neutral nations inspection teams, shall supervise and inspect the aforementioned approved replacement of combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition at the ports listed in Article 43 of this Armistice Agreement.

	(e)	Guarantee that appropriate punishment will be inflicted on personnel under their respective command who violate any of the provisions of this Armistice Agreement.

	(f)	Permit cemetery registration personnel from the other side to enter the area of Korea under their military control for a fixed period of time after this Armistice Agreement takes effect, in cases where burial sites are recorded and the existence of graves is verified, to go to the location of such graves, exhumed and remove the remains of military personnel who have died on that side, including the remains of deceased prisoners of war. Specific procedures and deadlines for carrying out the above work shall be determined by the Military Armistice Commission. The commanders of the opposing sides shall provide the other side with all available materials regarding the burial locations of the other side's deceased military personnel.

	(g)	Provide full protection and all possible assistance and cooperation to the Military Armistice Commission and its joint observer teams, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its neutral nations inspection teams, in the performance of their duties and tasks specified below. Provide full passage facilities for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its neutral nations inspection teams when traveling between the headquarters of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the ports listed in Article 43 of this Armistice Agreement via the main lines of communication agreed upon by both sides (see Annex 4), and when traveling between the headquarters of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and locations where violations of this Armistice Agreement have been reported. To avoid unnecessary delays, alternative routes and means of transportation shall be permitted when the main lines of communication are closed or impassable.

	(h)	Provide the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and their respective teams with the logistical support they require, including communication and transportation facilities.

	(i)	Jointly construct, manage, and maintain a suitable airport at the headquarters of the Military Armistice Commission, the use of which shall be determined by the Military Armistice Commission.

14. This Armistice Agreement shall apply to all opposing ground military forces under the military control of both sides. Such ground military forces shall respect the demilitarized zone and the areas of Korea under the military control of the other side.

15. This Armistice Agreement shall apply to all opposing naval military forces. Such naval military forces shall respect the waters adjacent to the demilitarized zone and the Korean land under the military control of the other side, and shall not conduct any kind of blockade against Korea.

16. This Armistice Agreement shall apply to all opposing air military forces. Such air military forces shall respect the demilitarized zone and the areas of Korea under the military control of the other side, as well as the airspace above the waters adjacent to these two areas.

17. The responsibility for observing and enforcing the terms and provisions of this Armistice Agreement rests with the signatories of this Armistice Agreement and their successor commanders. The commanders of the opposing sides shall take all necessary measures and methods within their respective commands to ensure that all their subordinates thoroughly comply with all the provisions of this Armistice Agreement. The commanders of the opposing sides shall actively cooperate with each other, and with the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, to achieve compliance with the letter and spirit of all provisions of this Armistice Agreement.
