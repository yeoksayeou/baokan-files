Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government held a preview reception on the 27th for the first Czechoslovak Republic film with Mandarin dialogue dubbed by our country, "Steel City." This film won the "Struggle for Social Progress Award" at the 5th International Film Festival.

Those attending the reception included Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, leading members of central and Beijing organizations and groups, and people from cultural and artistic circles, totaling more than 1,200 people.

Charge d'Affaires Jabroski of the Czechoslovak Republic's Embassy in China and embassy staff were also invited to attend the reception. Foreign diplomatic officials stationed in China were also invited to attend.

The reception was presided over by Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture of the Central People's Government. He said: After our country's films "Daughters of China," "Steel Soldier," and "People's Warrior" participated in the 5th, 6th, and 7th International Film Festivals held in Czechoslovakia, as well as the Czechoslovak Workers' Film Festival and Military Film Festival, "Steel City" is being screened in our country. This is a further development of the friendship and cultural exchange between the people of China and Czechoslovakia. "Steel City" is a film with high ideological and artistic qualities. It reflects the heroic deeds of the Czechoslovak working class struggling under the leadership of the Communist Party, and illustrates that no matter how tortuous the road of struggle may be, the final victory will surely belong to the working class and the broad masses of the people.

Charge d'Affaires Jabroski also spoke at the meeting, saying: The Czechoslovak people have experienced with great excitement and gratitude the artistic images created by the Chinese film industry that truthfully report the victorious struggles of the Chinese people's revolution. Today, on the eve of the third anniversary of the implementation of industrial nationalization in Czechoslovakia, I feel infinitely honored that "Steel City" can be screened in China, because it is a clear testament to the consolidation of our two countries' fraternal friendship and cultural cooperation. This friendship and cultural cooperation will directly promote and safeguard lasting peace among nations.

"Steel City" received unanimous praise from the audience during the screening.

    文化部举行捷影片“钢铁的城”预演招待会
    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府文化部二十七日举行由我国翻译的第一部华语对白的捷克斯洛伐克共和国影片“钢铁的城”预演招待会。这部影片曾获第五届国际电影节“争取社会进步斗争奖”。
    出席招待会的有中央人民政府副主席李济深和中央以及北京各机关、团体的负责人，文化艺术界人士共一千二百多人。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国驻我国大使馆代办雅布罗斯基和使馆人员也应邀出席了招待会。应邀出席招待会的还有各国驻我国外交官员。
    招待会由中央人民政府文化部部长沈雁冰主持。他讲话说：在我国影片“中华女儿”、“钢铁战士”、“人民的战士”等参加了捷克斯洛伐克举行的第五、六、七届国际电影节和捷克斯洛伐克的工人电影节及军事电影节之后，“钢铁的城”在我国映出，这是中捷两国人民友谊和文化交流的进一步发展。“钢铁的城”是一部具有高度的思想性和艺术性的影片，它反映了捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级在共产党领导下进行斗争的英勇事迹，说明无论斗争的道路是如何曲折，而最后胜利一定是属于工人阶级和广大人民的。
    雅布罗斯基代办也在会上讲话，他说：捷克斯洛伐克人民曾以极其兴奋和感谢的心情来体会中国电影事业所创造的那些真实地报道中国人民革命的胜利斗争的艺术形象。今天，捷克斯洛伐克实行工业国有化的三周年前夕，“钢铁的城”能在中国放映，我感到无限的荣幸，因为它是巩固我们两国兄弟般的友谊和文化合作关系的一个明证。这种友谊和文化合作将直接促进和维护国际间的持久和平。
    “钢铁的城”在放映时得到观众的一致赞誉。
