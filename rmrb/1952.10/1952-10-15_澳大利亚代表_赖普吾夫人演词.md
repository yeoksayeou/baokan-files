Speech by Mrs. Lappe-Wo, Representative of Australia

We, the Australian delegation, would like to express our warm thanks to the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace for their thoughtful hospitality and the natural, heartfelt friendship shown to each of us. We thank you for initiating such a conference and for your unhurried and efficient completion of every detail in organizing this conference. We can only speculate on a small part of the work happily accomplished by so many people working for us. We know that this is only possible in a country that is truly mobilized for peace, where everyone sees the role they play in building peace.

This conference shows that the struggle for world peace has entered a new historical stage. It has united the people of thirty-seven countries; of course, the people here do not refer to representatives of our governments, or members of any group, but to ordinary people.

Your Peace Committee and the Chinese people have given us your friendship and helped create a truly democratic atmosphere at this conference, in which more than four hundred delegates were able to freely express their personal views on the major issues of the day. We have spent a lot of time discussing major issues, and from these discussions, many resolutions and statements have been derived, which we wholeheartedly agree with. If implemented, these resolutions and statements will safeguard peace for us and our descendants.

However, in order for many people in our country to accept these statements and demands, we must first tear down the wall of fear and suspicion that is being built to separate our people from you. We have seen the new China, and we have had pleasant conversations, danced, and laughed with you—the people of China. We are amazed at the great achievements your new government has made in just three years since its establishment. But what encourages us the most is the liberation of your people. We know that you want peace, and you will never launch a war of aggression. We want to go back and tell the people of our country what we have seen, heard, and felt here.

    澳大利亚代表
    赖普吾夫人演词
    我们澳大利亚代表团，愿意向你们中国人民与中国人民保卫世界和平委员会，表示热烈的谢意，感谢你们周到的款待和在我们每个人面前表现的那种自然而然的出自内心的友谊。我们感谢你们发起召开这样一个会议，感谢你们从容不迫地、有效率地完成了组织这次会议的每一件细节工作。我们只能推测到一小部分关于这么多的为了我们而工作的人所愉快完成的工作。我们知道，只有在一个真正为和平而动员起来的国度里，每一个人都看到了自己在缔造和平里所起的作用，这种情况才有可能出现。
    这次会议表明，争取世界和平的斗争，已经进入了一个新的历史性的阶段。它已经把三十七个国家的人民团结起来了，当然，这里所说的人民并不是指我们各国政府的代表，或任何集团的成员，而是指普通的人民。
    你们的和平委员会，和你们中国人民，已经把你们的友谊给了我们，并且帮助造成了这次会议里的真正民主的气氛，在这种气氛中，四百多位代表都能够对今天的重大问题，自由地表示他们个人的看法。我们化了很多时间来讨论重大问题，从这些讨论中，已经得出许多决议和声明，我们都一心一意地赞同这些决议和声明，如果实行起来，就能保障我们和我们子孙后代的和平。
    但是，要使我们国家的很多人民，能够接受这些声明和要求，我们就必须先推倒那一道正在被建立起来、要把我国人民与你们隔开的恐惧和猜疑的墙。我们已经看到了新中国，我们曾经跟你们——中国的人民——在一起畅快地谈话，跳舞和欢笑。我们对你们的新政府刚成立三年就得到这样大的成就，感到惊奇。但是，我们最感到欢欣鼓舞的，就是你们人民的解放。我们知道你们要和平，你们永远不会发动侵略战争。我们要回去把我们在这里所见、所闻以及亲身感受到的，告诉我们本国的人民。
