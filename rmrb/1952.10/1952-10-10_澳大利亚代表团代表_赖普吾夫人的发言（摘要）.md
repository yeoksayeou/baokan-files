Speech by Mrs. Rappe, Representative of the Australian Delegation (Summary)
    I am speaking now as an ordinary woman, but because I have this special right, I feel that I have a special responsibility.
    I am an Australian, born in China, married to an Englishman, and now a mother of four children.
    As a Christian, I have dedicated my life to the Prince of Peace. Today, Christians all over the world are deeply disturbed by the world situation, and they are eagerly hoping to participate in a movement that can guarantee international peace and realize their lofty aspirations and ideals. Christians can and must be mobilized to fight for the defense of peace and human friendship.
    As a mother, I wholeheartedly pray for the lives of my children—hoping that they will have fulfilling, interesting, happy, and creative lives serving others, but first and foremost, life itself! Today, the lives of them and all mothers' children are in danger. In my opinion, germ warfare is by no means an academic issue to be debated over tea. During the last war, cholera occurred in western China. One day, I heard that a student had died of cholera in our university dormitory. When I returned home, I found my three-month-old baby vomiting non-stop and then showing signs of diarrhea. The two hours we waited for the doctor were a terrible nightmare! After diagnosis, it was proved that my baby only suffered from acute gastroenteritis, but since then, the word "cholera" has never been just the name of an ordinary disease to me. If this is how I felt in that situation, how must the mothers in Korea and Northeast China feel? They stand by their children, watching them slowly wither away before their eyes, just because they picked up something tasty or drank some tap water that they usually consider clean.
    A few days ago, at the germ warfare exhibition, I saw an article published by an American scientist, saying that the bacteria used in germ warfare must be selected for their toxicity and immediate effect. They considered poliomyelitis, but ultimately did not use this bacterium because it crippled people, but was not fatal enough!
    We are deeply moved by the rapid development and improvement of medical and health work in China in the past three years. Chinese children are vaccinated against nine different infectious diseases in schools, and even the streets, alleys, and courtyards in the smallest villages are cleaned and swept. After the fly-catching campaign was launched, people immediately grabbed fly swatters to swat flies and mosquitoes as soon as they saw them. Are those in the West who are abusing medicine to engage in large-scale human slaughter going to destroy all of this, and not just destroy it?
    We must widely publicize the report of the International Scientific Committee, because this report is especially powerful for those who previously did not believe that germ warfare might be going on. Once the truth is understood, a great wave of opposition to this crime will arise, especially in the United States, Britain, and Australia.
    As an Australian, I am proud of our beautiful country. But Australia is rapidly becoming a docile colony of the United States. Many people are completely unaware of this situation, and many of those who feel uneasy about it believe that we have no choice but to follow the United States, no matter how much we dislike or oppose American policies. One of the main factors contributing to this situation is fear of Soviet and Chinese aggression or control. Although we here may find this extremely absurd, this fear does exist, and only reports based on firsthand experience from those who have been to the Soviet Union and China can dispel this fear.
    My husband and I have been familiar with and loved China for many years. We have seen the Chinese people during the war, and the Chinese people under the rule of Japan and the Kuomintang. In 1939, my husband traveled a long distance with the guerrillas; in late 1948, he was in Beijing when it was liberated. We have worked in cooperatives and taught at universities. Although we have always known that the Chinese people are a great nation, we are very surprised by their great achievements in the last three years. Now, in response to the current urgent call, we are leaving China to return to our own country to continue our work for peace. We must help the people of Australia and Britain understand China, and more importantly, we must make them fully believe that China needs peace and will never wage a war of aggression.
    We are about to return to England. The British people are feeling extremely disturbed and uneasy under the increasing American dominance. They deeply resent their country being turned into what the United States arrogantly calls its "unsinkable aircraft carrier." They know that another world war would completely destroy Britain. Now the peace movement is receiving widespread support, and we have a special responsibility in these peace movements.
    Therefore, as a Christian, as a mother, as a woman of Australian origin who grew up in China and married an Englishman, I earnestly ask for peace, and I will spare no cost to fight for peace to the end.

### 澳大利亚代表团代表  赖普吾夫人的发言（摘要）

    澳大利亚代表团代表
    赖普吾夫人的发言（摘要）
    我现在是以一个普通女人的身份来发言，但是由于我有了这个特殊的权利，我更感到自己有特殊的责任。
    我是一个澳大利亚人，生在中国，和一个英国人结了婚，现在已是四个孩子的母亲了。
    作为一个基督教徒，我已经把生命奉献给和平之主。在今天，全世界各地的基督徒，对世界的情势深感不安，他们正热切地希望能参加一个可以保证国际和平并可以实现他们崇高的愿望与理想的运动。基督徒能够而且必须动员起来，为保卫和平与人类的友爱而斗争。
    作为一个母亲，我衷心地为我的儿女们的生命祈祷——希望他们有一个为别人服务的充实的、有兴趣的、快乐的和有创造性的生命，但第一还是生命本身！在今天他们以及所有母亲的儿女们的生命本身，都在危险之中。在我看来，细菌战决不是一个什么在茶余酒后争论一番的学术问题。上一次大战中，在中国西部就发生过霍乱病症，有一天我刚听到一个学生因霍乱死在我们大学的宿舍里了，一回家，却发现我一个三个月的婴儿呕吐不止，接着并增加了下泻的征候，我们等待着医生的两个钟头真是一场可怕的恶梦啊！经过诊断，证明我的婴儿只是患急性胃炎，但是从此以后，霍乱两个字对我的感觉就决不仅是一个普通的病的名字了。在这种情形下，我的感受竟是这样的，那么朝鲜和中国东北的母亲们的感觉又该怎样呀？她们站在儿女的身旁，亲眼看着自己的儿女只因为拾着了一点好吃的东西，或是喝了一点他们惯常认为是清洁的自来水，而在她们眼前慢慢地干瘪下去。
    前几天，在细菌战展览会中，我看见美国科学家发表的一篇文章，说道：细菌战所用的细菌，必须挑选有毒和立即见效的细菌。他们考虑到脊髓灰白质炎。但是最后没有用这种细菌，因为这种病使人残废，然而还不够致人于死命！
    我们对于中国在过去三年中迅速发展和改进医药卫生的工作，深为感动。中国儿童，在学校中受到预防九种不同传染病的注射，即使是最小村庄里的街道，里弄和院子都实行清洁扫除，捕蝇运动展开后，人们一看见苍蝇、蚊子，就马上抓起蝇拍去打。难道西方那些正在滥用医学来从事大规模屠杀人类的人们要把这一切都加以破坏，甚至不仅仅加以破坏吗？
    我们必须广泛地宣传国际科学委员会的报告书，因为这个报告书对于那些从前不相信细菌战可能在进行的人们特别有力量。一旦明了事实真相后就会产生一个反对这种罪行的大浪潮，特别是在美国、英国和澳大利亚。
    作为一个澳大利亚人，我为我们美丽的祖国而感到自豪。但是澳大利亚正在迅速地成为美国的驯服的殖民地。很多人完全没有认识到这种情况，那些感觉到这种情况而感不安的人们，又有很多人认为我们除了跟随美国而外，也没有别的办法，尽管我们怎样不喜欢或反对美国的政策。构成这种情况的主要因素之一，就是害怕苏联和中国的侵略或控制。尽管我们在这里的人可能觉得这是个极其荒唐的事，但这种恐惧的确存在，只有靠曾经到过苏联和中国的人作身历其境的根据事实的报告，才能消除这种恐惧心理。
    我同我的丈夫熟悉中国，热爱中国已经是多少年了。我们曾经看见过在战争时期的中国人民，在日本和国民党统治下的中国人民。一九三九年，我的丈夫曾同游击队一道走过很远的路程；一九四八年年底北京解放的时候，他也正在北京。我们在合作社里工作过，在大学里教过书。虽然我们一向知道中国人民是一个伟大的民族，但他们最近三年来的伟大的成就，连我们也感到非常惊奇。现在，为了响应目前的紧急号召，我们就要离开中国，回到自己的国家去继续从事和平的工作。我们一定要帮助澳大利亚和英国人民了解中国，更重要的，我们一定要让他们完全相信中国需要和平，它永远也不会进行侵略战争。
    我们马上要回到英国去了。英国人民在日益加强的美国统治之下，正感到无限的烦乱和不安。他们深切地痛恨自己的国家变成了美国所狂妄地喊叫的它的“不沉的航空母舰”。他们知道再一次世界大战将会使英国全部毁灭掉的。现在和平运动正受到普遍的支持，而在这些和平运动中，我们有着特殊的责任。
    因此，作为一个基督徒，作为一个母亲，作为一个原籍澳大利亚、生长在中国而嫁给了一个英国人的女人，我热切地要求和平，我将不惜付出任何代价为和平而斗争到底。
