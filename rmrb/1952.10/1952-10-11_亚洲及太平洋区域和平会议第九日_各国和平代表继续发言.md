Xinhua News Agency, October 10th:

    The ninth day of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference began at 9:30 am on the 10th. A total of ten representatives from nine countries spoke at the meeting. Among the speakers were labor leaders, trade union workers, writers, actors, professors, lawyers, and members of parliament, including a former premier of a state in India. They had various religious and political beliefs. They continued to expose the profound disasters caused to the lives and culture of people in various countries by the aggressive war policies of imperialist countries, especially the US government, from different perspectives and angles, and demonstrated the firm will of the people of various countries to oppose war and defend peace, oppose aggression and defend independence, freedom, and national culture.
    The executive chairmen of the 10th meeting were: Victor James (Australia), Mian Iftikharuddin (Pakistan), Antonio Cruz Franco (Guatemala), Koram Assein Rahimián (Iran), Dechin Gotomai (Burma).
    The meeting was conducted under the chairmanship of Victor James.
    The first speaker was Nakamura Kanzaburo, acting head of the Japanese delegation and a famous actor. He used the experience of the Shinseiza theater troupe, which he leads, to vividly illustrate how US warmongers and the Yoshida government are brutally destroying Japanese culture, and how the Japanese people are bravely defending Japanese progressive culture. He pointed out that warmongers are spreading militaristic colonial culture in Japan to poison the people, destroy Japanese national culture, and cruelly persecute progressive cultural circles in Japan who maintain peace. The Japanese authorities prevented the Shinseiza theater troupe from producing progressive films and prevented the troupe from performing. However, people from all walks of life in Japan have mobilized to fight for peace, risking their lives to defend Japan's progressive culture. The strong support of the masses enabled the progressive film of the Shinseiza theater troupe to be successfully filmed, and the strong struggle of the masses enabled the troupe to continue performing. Nakamura Kanzaburo finally declared: The Japanese people will overcome any difficulties and fight the enemies of peace together with the peace-loving people of all countries. After his speech, all the representatives stood up and applauded warmly to pay tribute to the Japanese progressive cultural figures and the Japanese people who are fighting bravely in a difficult environment.
    Canadian delegate Mrs. Balash then spoke. She pointed out that the issue of national independence also exists in Canada. American capital has taken away Canada's natural resources. The United States has dragged Canada into its military adventures. Canada has now become a modern colonial country under American control. However, the Canadian people are dissatisfied with following the United States, they oppose conscription and demand that Canadian troops withdraw from Korea. Mrs. Balash said: We Canadian representatives at this meeting have gained a deeper understanding of the fact that the people have enough power to achieve peace. We have a better understanding than before of the true meaning of national independence and that it is a condition for lasting peace. We guarantee that we will return home and fight to unite all anti-war forces in Canada.
    Pakistani representative, lawyer Ataur Rahman, then spoke. He said: The people of Asia, who have always been exploited by imperialism and suffered immensely from the devastating wars they have brought, need lasting peace. However, the imperialists, who are responsible for two bloody world wars and their tragic consequences, have carried out germ warfare against the Korean and Chinese people, rearmed the Japanese militarists, and supported the enemy Chiang Kai-shek who was driven out by the Chinese people, and they are using the same conspiracy to create a disaster area in Kashmir. He also revealed that US imperialism, under the guise of using US dollars to aid the Asian people, openly seizes Asian markets and establishes military bases everywhere. Rahman pointed out: Our greatest strength is the power of public opinion of the people of the world. We must form public opinion among the people of the world against the aggression of the warmongers. It is precisely because they fear public opinion that the American imperialists have denied their criminal acts of conducting germ warfare. Rahman finally said: The Chinese people, under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong, have taken the lead, and now all peace-loving people must unite and fight for peace.
    Korean representative, Vice-Chairman of the Korean Federation of Literature and Art Organizations and famous writer Lee Tae-joon, spoke on the issue of cultural exchange. He said: Asia's splendid cultural heritage is the crystallization of the wisdom and labor of the Asian people over thousands of years. We must rescue it from barbaric destruction and promote exchange. This endeavor will surely enrich the cultural treasury of mankind throughout the world and will become a major component of the cause of defending world peace and security. Lee Tae-joon gave a detailed account of the heinous crimes committed by American bandits in destroying and plundering Korean cultural relics. He said that American bandits stole precious ancient Korean musical instruments and scores, as well as porcelain, and used the "Annals of the Joseon Dynasty," which compiled 500 years of Korean historical materials, to shine their shoes, and crushed ancient lacquerware, a treasure of the world from more than 2,000 years ago. Lee Tae-joon emphasized: If these barbarians invaded the defense line now defended by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who can guarantee that the culture of any other country can avoid the fate suffered by Korean culture? Lee Tae-joon finally said: If cultural workers in the Asian and Pacific regions can unite with a conscience, wisdom, and enthusiasm for protecting culture and peace, and devote themselves to the cause of maintaining peace, we will surely defeat war. His speech was warmly welcomed by the audience.
    Burmese representative, lawyer Zheng Pi Yuan, reported in his speech the economic aggression of British and American imperialism and the disasters caused to the Burmese people by the forced implementation of blockades and embargoes. He pointed out that, on the one hand, the excess profits extracted by the imperialists in Burma every year are nearly 270 million Kyats; on the other hand, Burma's national economy is shrinking day by day. The so-called economic assistance from the United States is to export plasma, vaccines and consumer goods that Burma can manufacture, strangling Burma's domestic industry and increasing Burma's economic difficulties. He reported on the victory of the Burmese people in opposing the US imperialists' forced implementation of blockades and embargoes; and pointed out: If the people of all countries in the world unite and use their strength, they can break the blockades, embargoes and restrictions forcibly implemented by the imperialists.
    After a short break, the meeting continued under the chairmanship of Koram Assein Rahimián.
    Indian representative, former Premier of Bhopal State, Indian Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Bhopal State Congress Party, Chatur Narain Malaviya, began his speech by emphasizing the feelings of the Indian people and the people of the world towards the great and invincible Korean people. He then said: Among the free and peaceful Chinese people, the cause of peace is most free and comfortable. The mere fact that the representatives can meet in Beijing guarantees the success of the meeting. Malaviya described the disasters experienced by the Indian people in the war, and now life is still as breathless as in the middle of a war, which is why the Indian people eagerly demand peace. Malaviya condemned the atrocities of imperialist countries in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, and the crime of conducting germ warfare, saying that the American "way of life" of slaughtering a large group of people to serve a small group of profiteers is a damn "way of life". Malaviya described the achievements of the Indian peace movement, saying that India has collected 2.5 million signatures for a declaration to strive for the conclusion of a five-power peace treaty. Housewife Kaur collected 60,000 signatures by herself, Pastor Pola Kaisen collected 20,000 signatures, and students Das and Singh each collected 40,000 signatures. Malaviya emphasized that he fully agreed with the opinions expressed by Indian representative and Indian Communist leader Gopalan at the meeting a few days ago and his enthusiastic support for the heroic struggles of the people of Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya against aggression and the Japanese people against aggression and re-militarization. He said: Although we are opposed to each other in Congress, we are engaged in a common cause in the peace movement. Malaviya finally said: I assure our Pakistani friends that the Indian people ardently hope for a peaceful resolution of our problems. I assure you that the Indian people, despite their different parties and divergent opinions, will strive for peace and are always ready to serve this cause. Malaviya's speech aroused warm welcome at the meeting, and his words were constantly interrupted by loud applause.
    Sri Lankan representative, Member of Parliament Samarakkody, then spoke. He said that the amazing achievements of the Chinese people in just three years are a great motivating force for maintaining peace. As soldiers defending peace, we stand shoulder to shoulder with other oppressed people in Asia in the struggle for national independence.
    Next, Executive Chairman Rahimián announced that the Indian delegation presented flowers to the representatives of the people of Vietnam and Malaya who are fighting heroically for peace and national independence. The audience stood up and applauded warmly. Eight Indian representatives presented flowers and gifts expressing friendship, sympathy and respect to the representatives of the people of Vietnam and Malaya.
    Mexican representative, trade union worker Lazaro Rubio Felix, then spoke, and talked about the importance of this conference in the struggle for peace. He said: The peace conference includes a geographic area with significant economic, political, and cultural value; on the one hand, there are many countries in this region that are still controlled by American aggressors; on the other hand, there are people who have gained complete independence, such as the people of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, who are contributing their great potential to the sacred cause of peace. The task of this conference is to prevent the conspiracies of imperialism, which is accustomed to trading the freedom and blood of all nations, from succeeding by passing relevant resolutions and taking necessary steps. He emphasized: We must fight for peace and national independence for all colonial and semi-colonial nations, and we must also achieve the signing of a five-power peace treaty through the growing strength of the people to eliminate the threat of war. He said: Opening up the road to peace is the great importance of this conference.
    Deputy Head of the Japanese Delegation and University Professor Minami Hiroshi delivered a speech entitled "Learning and Peace." He pointed out that science and technology should serve peace-loving people. However, today's warmongers are using science and technology to serve imperialist wars of aggression. Minami then used concrete examples to illustrate how American imperialists are using Japanese science and technology to revive Japanese militarism, to serve the war of aggression against Korea, and to prepare for aggression against other Asian countries. He also used Japan as an example to illustrate how science and technology encounter a crisis of destruction in countries without independence and autonomy. Minami emphasized: Faced with such a crisis, we must resolutely fight against those aggressors who lead science and technology astray and lead culture to death. Our task is to seize science and technology from the clutches of warmongers. Scientists must also realize that resolutely defending peace is the most urgent and important task today, and act according to this belief.
    Costa Rican representative Osvaldo Rodriguez Jimenez pointed out: In Central America, between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, is the throat of the American continent. The infringement of the sovereignty of Central American countries by American monopoly capitalists has affected the lives of the people of these countries. The generals of the Pentagon are attempting to force five Central American countries to form a union in order to carry out new wars, dig a new canal through Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador, and occupy Costa Rica, which is located in the area between the Panama Canal and the new canal, and build the largest airport in Central America. However, Jimenez emphasized: The people of Central American countries love peace because they love freedom. He said: When official newspapers collected volunteers to go to Korea to participate in the war of aggression, only one person signed up among the one million people of Costa Rica. Jimenez finally firmly declared: We are determined to unite with our brother countries of El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama in Central America to expose to the people the purpose of the American generals who are forcing us to prepare for war, and do everything possible to inherit the heroic tradition of the Central American people rising up together in 1856 to expel the North American aggressor troops. This heroic oath won warm applause from the audience.
    After Jimenez spoke, all the representatives of the Costa Rican delegation went to the rostrum and presented the heroic Chinese people with a medal cherished by the Costa Rican people, a medal won by a patriotic warrior who participated in six battles in the 1856 struggle to defend peace, freedom and national independence. Guo Moruo, on behalf of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, accepted the medal. At this time, the audience stood up and applauded thunderously.
    Deputy Secretary-General of the Conference Louis Wheaton announced at the meeting the congratulatory telegrams successively received from Indian and Japanese groups and individuals, and congratulatory telegrams from various national trade union organizations and welfare organizations in China. The audience applauded warmly.
    The 10th meeting was adjourned at this point.

    各国和平代表继续发言
    【新华社十日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第九日会议在十日上午九时三十分开始举行。会上共有九个国家的十个代表在会上发言。发言的人当中有工人领袖、工会工作者、作家、演员、教授、律师、国会议员，其中还有一个是印度一个邦的前任总理。他们有着各种不同的宗教信仰与政治信仰。他们继续从各个不同的方面和不同的角度，揭露帝国主义国家特别是美国政府的侵略战争政策对各国人民的生活和文化所造成的深重灾难，并说明各国人民反对战争、保卫和平，反对侵略、保卫独立自由与民族文化的坚强意志。
    十日会议的执行主席是：维克多·詹姆斯（澳大利亚），米安·伊夫提卡鲁丁（巴基斯坦），安东尼奥·克鲁斯·弗兰哥（危地马拉），柯拉姆·阿赛因·拉希米安（伊朗），德钦哥都迈（缅甸）。
    会议在执行主席维克多·詹姆斯主持下进行。
    首先发言的是日本代表团代理团长、著名演员中村玩右卫门。他拿他领导的前进座剧团的遭遇，生动地说明美国战争贩子与吉田政府如何在横暴地摧残着日本的文化，而日本人民又如何在英勇地保卫着日本的进步文化。他指出，战争贩子们在日本散布军国主义化的殖民地文化来毒害人民，破坏日本的民族文化，残酷迫害日本的维护和平的进步文化界。日本当局阻止前进座剧团拍制进步影片，阻止剧团演出。但是，日本各阶层人民已经为争取和平而动员起来了，他们冒着生命的危险，保卫着日本的进步文化。群众的大力支援使前进座剧团的进步影片终于拍摄成功，群众的坚强斗争并使剧团能够继续演出。中村玩右卫门最后宣称：日本人民要和爱好和平的各国人民一道克服任何困难，与和平的敌人进行斗争。他发言毕，全体代表起立热烈鼓掌，向在艰苦环境中英勇奋斗的日本进步文化界人士及日本人民致敬。
    加拿大女代表巴拉什夫人接着发言。她指出，加拿大也存在着民族独立问题。美国资本夺去了加拿大的自然资源。美国把加拿大拖入它的军事冒险。加拿大今日已成为美国支配下的现代殖民地国家。但是，加拿大人民是不满意依从美国的，他们反对征兵，要求加拿大军队撤出朝鲜。巴拉什夫人说：我们加拿大代表在这次会议上对于人民有足够力量来实现和平这一事实，有了更深刻的了解。我们比以前更进一步明白了民族独立的真义，明白它是持久和平的条件。我们保证回国后要为团结加拿大一切反战力量而奋斗。
    巴基斯坦代表、律师阿陶尔·拉赫曼接着发言。他说：一向受帝国主义剥削、受着他们所带来的毁灭性战争无比痛苦的亚洲人民，需要持久和平。但是，那些对两次血腥的世界大战及其悲惨后果都要负责的帝国主义者，又向朝鲜和中国人民进行了细菌战，重新武装日本军阀，扶植被中国人民所驱逐出去的敌人蒋介石，他们又用同样的阴谋在克什米尔造成一个灾难区。他并揭露：美帝国主义以用美元援助亚洲人民为名，公开夺取亚洲的市场，到处建立军事基地。拉赫曼指出：我们最大的力量就是全世界人民的舆论力量。我们必须在世界人民中形成反对战争贩子们侵略的舆论。正是因为害怕人民的舆论，美国帝国主义者才矢口否认他们进行细菌战的罪恶行为。拉赫曼最后说：中国人民在伟大的毛泽东主席领导下已经带了头，现在就要一切爱好和平的人民团结起来为和平而斗争。
    朝鲜代表、朝鲜文学艺术总同盟副委员长、著名作家李泰俊发言，论述了文化交流的问题。他说：亚洲的辉煌灿烂的文化遗产，是几千年来亚洲人民的智慧与劳动的结晶。我们要从野蛮破坏中把它拯救出来，要促进交流，这一事业必将丰富全世界人类的文化宝库，必将成为保卫世界和平与安全事业的主要内容。李泰俊详细叙述了美国强盗破坏和掠夺朝鲜文物的令人发指的罪行。他说美国强盗把朝鲜的贵重古代乐器和乐谱以及瓷器等偷运走了，而把五百年来集大成的朝鲜史料“李朝实录”拿来擦皮鞋，把二千余年前的全世界之宝的古代漆器踩得粉碎。李泰俊强调说：假设这种野蛮人侵越现在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军所防御的防线的话，谁能保证其他任何国家的文化能够避免朝鲜文化所遭到的命运呢？李泰俊最后说：亚洲及太平洋区域的文化工作者，若能以爱护文化与和平的良心、睿知和热情，一致团结尽力于维护和平的事业，我们一定能战胜战争。他的发言受到全场的热烈欢迎。
    缅甸代表、律师郑丕远在发言中报告了美英帝国主义的经济侵略以及强迫实行封锁禁运，对缅甸人民所造成的灾难。他指出，一方面，帝国主义者每年在缅甸榨取的超额利润将近二亿七千万缅币；另一方面，缅甸的国民经济则日益萎缩。美国的所谓经济援助，就是向缅甸输出缅甸所能制造的血浆和疫苗，输出消费品等，扼杀了缅甸本国的工业，增加了缅甸的经济困难。他报告了缅甸人民反对美帝国主义强制实行封锁禁运所取得的胜利；并指出：如果全世界各国人民团结一致运用他们的力量，他们就可以打破帝国主义者强制实行的封锁、禁运与限制。
    会议在短时间休息后，在执行主席柯拉姆·阿赛因·拉希米安主持下继续进行。
    印度代表、前波保尔邦总理、印度国会议员和波保尔邦国大党主席查图尔·纳拉英·马拉维亚发言时首先强调印度人民和全世界人民对伟大和不可战胜的朝鲜人民的情感。他接着说：在自由与和平的中国人民当中，对于和平事业是最自由最适意的。仅是代表们能在北京相聚这个事实就可以保证会议的成功。马拉维亚叙述了印度人民在战争中经历过的灾难，而现在生活依然像在战争中间一样使人喘不过气来，这就是印度人民热切要求和平的原因。马拉维亚谴责帝国主义国家在朝鲜、越南、马来亚的暴行，和进行细菌战的罪恶，他说美国的以屠杀一大群人而替一小撮唯利是图的人效劳的“生活方式”，是一种该死的“生活方式”。马拉维亚叙述了印度和平运动的成就，他说印度已为争取缔结五大国和平公约的宣言征集了二百五十万个签名。家庭主妇考尔一个人就征集了六万个签名，泼拉开森牧师征集了二万个签名，学生达斯和辛格各征集了四万个签名。马拉维亚强调说明，他完全同意印度代表、印共领袖高普兰几天前在会上所发表的意见及其对朝鲜、越南、马来亚人民反对侵略和日本人民反对侵略和重新军国主义化的英勇斗争的热烈支持。他说：虽然我们在国会里是互相对立的，但是在和平运动中我们一起从事共同事业。马拉维亚最后说：我向巴基斯坦的朋友们保证，印度人民热烈希望和平解决我们之间的问题。我向你们保证，印度人民尽管党派不同，意见分歧，但将努力争取和平，随时准备为这一事业服务。马拉维亚的发言引起会场上热烈的欢迎，他的话不断为响亮的掌声打断。
    锡兰代表、国会议员萨马拉科地接着发言。他说，中国人民在短短三年中的惊人成就，是维护和平的伟大的鼓动力量。作为保卫和平的战士，我们和亚洲其他被压迫人民并肩站在一起，进行着争取民族独立的斗争。
    接着，执行主席拉希米安宣布印度代表团向正在为争取和平与民族独立英勇斗争的越南和马来亚人民的代表献花，全场起立热烈鼓掌，八个印度代表向越南和马来亚人民的代表献赠表示友谊、同情和尊敬的鲜花与礼物。
    墨西哥代表、工会工作者拉沙罗·卢比奥·费利克斯接着发言，他谈述了这次会议在争取和平斗争中的重要性。他说：和平会议包括一个有着重大经济、政治与文化价值的地理区域；这个区域中一方面有着许多仍然被美国侵略者控制着的国家；另一方面又有着已经获得了完全独立的人民，例如中华人民共和国和苏联的人民，他们正以他们伟大的潜力贡献于神圣的和平事业。这个会议的任务就是要通过各项有关的决议和采取必要的步骤，使惯于买卖各民族的自由与鲜血的帝国主义的阴谋无法得逞。他强调说：我们要为一切殖民地和半殖民地民族的和平和民族独立而斗争，我们还要通过日益增长的人民力量，来取得签订五大国和平公约，以消除战争的威胁。他说：开辟走向和平的道路，就是这次会议的极大重要性所在。
    日本代表团副团长、大学教授南博发表题为“学问与和平”的演说。他指出：科学和技术是应该为爱好和平的人民服务的。但是，今天战争贩子们正把科学和技术用来为帝国主义侵略战争服务。南博接着用具体的事例来说明美国帝国主义者怎样利用日本的科学和技术为复活日本军国主义、为侵略朝鲜的战争、为准备侵略亚洲其他国家服务。他同时以日本为例来说明在没有独立和自主的国家里，科学和技术怎样遭遇到毁灭的危机。南博强调说：面临这样的危机，我们必须对那些把科学和技术引入歧途并使文化走向死亡的侵略者，进行坚决的斗争。我们的任务就是把科学和技术从战争贩子的魔爪中夺回来。科学家也必须觉悟到，坚决地保卫和平，是今天最紧急、最重大的任务，并根据这个信念行动起来。
    哥斯达黎加代表奥斯瓦尔多·罗德利格兹·希迈尼兹发言时指出：在太平洋和大西洋之间的中美洲，是美洲大陆的咽喉。美国垄断资本家侵犯中美洲国家的主权，已使这些国家人民的生活受到影响。五角大楼的将军们为了进行新的战争，正企图迫使中美洲的五个国家成立一种联合，开凿一条穿过尼加拉瓜、洪都拉斯和萨尔瓦多的新运河，并占领位于巴拿马运河和新运河中间地带的哥斯达黎加，筑起中美洲最大的飞机场。但是，希迈尼兹强调指出：中美洲各国人民是爱好和平的，因为他们爱好自由。他说：当官方报纸征集前往朝鲜参加侵略战争的志愿兵时，在一百万哥斯达黎加人民中只有一个人报名。希迈尼兹最后坚定地宣称：我们决心和中美洲的萨尔瓦多、洪都拉斯、危地马拉、巴拿马各兄弟国家联合起来，向人民揭穿美国将军们强迫我们进行战争准备的目的，并尽一切力量继承一八五六年中美洲人民一齐起来驱逐北美侵略军队的英雄传统。这个英雄的誓言博得全场热烈的掌声。
    在希迈尼兹讲话后，哥斯达黎加代表团全体代表走上主席台，以哥斯达黎加人民珍视的纪念章，一个在一八五六年保卫和平、自由与民族独立的斗争中参加过六次战斗的爱国勇士获得的纪念章，赠送给英勇的中国人民。郭沫若代表中国人民保卫世界和平委员会接受了这个纪念章。这时，全场起立，掌声雷动。
    大会副秘书长路易士·惠吞在会上宣布大会陆续收到的印度、日本的团体和个人的贺电，中国各全国性工会组织、福利团体的贺电，全场热烈鼓掌。
    十日会议至此休会。
