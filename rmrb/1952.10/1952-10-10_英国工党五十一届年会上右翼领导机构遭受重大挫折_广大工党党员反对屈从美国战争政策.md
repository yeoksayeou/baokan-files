Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The British Labour Party held its 51st annual conference in Morecambe, Lancashire, from September 29th to October 3rd. 1,224 delegates attended the conference.

    Although this annual conference, as in the past, was conducted under the strong manipulation of the Labour Party's right-wing leadership, the conference process showed that the resistance of millions of ordinary Labour Party members to the Labour Party's right-wing leaders, who followed the United States and pursued a war policy, was further strengthened.

    More than 400 proposals were included in the original agenda of the conference, most of which criticized the domestic and foreign policies of the Labour Party's right-wing leadership, especially the expansion of armaments policy. Of the 68 proposals on foreign policy, only one supported the policies pursued by the leadership.

    Representatives of the Labour Party's lower-level members spoke at the meeting, opposing the British policy of subservience to the United States, demanding that Britain break away from the control of the US ruling clique and adopt an independent foreign policy, especially on the foreign policy issues of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Many representatives expressed deep dissatisfaction with the US policy of reviving German militarism and fiercely criticized the Korean and Malayan wars. When discussing foreign policy on the afternoon of October 1st, Ms. Melrose, a representative from Sheffield, asked the conference to reconsider the policy of using British troops in Korea. Pike, the representative from Uxbridge, said: Imperialists are now attempting to interfere in the People's Republic of China in the same way they interfered in the young Soviet Republic in the past. His words aroused a burst of cheers.

    Although the right-wing Labour Party leaders such as Attlee, Morrison, Noel-Baker, and Griffiths made anti-Soviet slanders at the meeting in an attempt to defend their war policies, the situation at the meeting could not satisfy them. Under the insistence of representatives of lower-level members, the meeting passed a resolution demanding the expansion of trade between East and West and demanding that British troops not be used in Europe or any other place to forcibly change territories. In terms of the expansion of armaments and war preparations policy, the right-wing Labour leaders received a serious warning. When the meeting voted on this issue, 2,288,000 votes demanded a reduction in the expansion plan. Although the right-wing leadership relied on an undemocratic voting system to veto this proposal, even Reuters admitted that the majority of votes it received was "surprisingly small."

    In the election of the new executive committee—the Labour Party's leadership—the right-wing leadership group suffered a significant setback. Morrison, a veteran right-wing figure who had almost unhinderedly served as a member of the executive committee and one of the Labour leaders for thirty years, was surprisingly defeated in this election. This event further proved that the prestige of the right-wing Labour Party leaders has been swept away. Even the Associated Press had to admit that the election result was "an accurate reflection of the mood of the ordinary Labour Party members."

    The resistance of the broad masses of Labour Party members reflected at the Morecambe Conference has alarmed the right-wing leadership group. Former Labour government finance minister Gaitskell, in a speech on the 5th, expressed concern about the large number of proposals and speeches at this year's Labour Party conference that opposed the policies of the right-wing leadership group. He said: These proposals and speeches were all so-called "Communist instigated," "which is a very shocking situation."

    Kudryavtsev, an observer for the Soviet "Izvestia," commented on the Morecambe Annual Conference, saying: The more openly the Labour Party's right-wing leadership supports the policy of expanding armaments and war preparations, the deeper the gap between it and the lower-level members. No matter what conspiracies and tricks the right-wing Labour agents of British imperialism use, they will never be able to make the British people believe in lies. The British people are increasingly firmly demanding peace and pursuing an independent foreign policy.

    英国工党五十一届年会上右翼领导机构遭受重大挫折
    广大工党党员反对屈从美国战争政策
    【新华社八日讯】英国工党从九月二十九日到十月三日在兰开夏摩尔坎举行第五十一届年会。出席会议的代表有一千二百二十四人。
    本届年会虽然和往常一样是在工党右翼领导机构强力操纵下进行的，但是会议进程却显示出数百万工党普通党员对于追随美国、奉行战争政策的工党右翼领袖的反抗正在进一步加强。
    列入大会原订议程的共有四百多件提案，其中大部分都批评工党右翼领导机构的国内外政策，特别是扩张军备政策。在六十八件关于外交政策的提案中，只有一件提案赞成领导机构所奉行的政策。
    工党下层党员群众的代表们在会上发言，反对英国屈从美国的政策，要求英国摆脱美国统治集团的控制而采取独立的外交政策，特别是在对苏联和中华人民共和国的外交政策问题上。许多代表对美国复活德国军国主义的政策深表不满，并且猛烈抨击朝鲜和马来亚战争。在十月一日下午讨论外交问题时，设菲尔德的女代表梅罗士要求大会重新考虑在朝鲜使用英国军队的政策。阿克斯布利治的代表派克说：帝国主义者现在企图按照他们过去干涉年青的苏维埃共和国的方法来干涉中华人民共和国。他的话引起了一片欢呼。
    右翼工党头子艾德礼、莫里逊、诺尔—贝克、葛里菲斯之流尽管在会上发表反苏谰言企图替他们的战争政策辩解，但是会议的情况却不能使他们称心如意。在下层党员群众代表们的坚持之下，会议通过了决议，要求扩大东西方之间的贸易，并要求不得在欧洲或任何其他地方利用英国军队来强迫变更领土。在扩军备战政策方面，右翼工党领袖们受到了严重的警告，当会议就这个问题进行表决时，有二百二十八万八千票要求削减扩军计划。右翼领导机构虽然依靠不民主的表决制度否决了这个提案，但是连路透社也承认，它所获得的多数票是“少得惊人”。
    在选举新的执行委员会——工党领导机构——时，右翼领导集团遭到了意义重大的挫折。三十年来几乎一直毫无阻碍地充当执行委员会委员和工党领袖之一的老牌右翼分子莫里逊，竟然在这次选举中落选。这件事进一步证明了右翼工党头子们的威信扫地。连美联社也不得不承认，这次选举结果是“工党普通党员群众情绪的确切的反映”。
    摩尔坎会议上所反映出来的工党广大党员群众的反抗，已使右翼领导集团感到惊慌。前任工党政府财政大臣贾兹克尔在五日发表的演说中，对于工党本届年会上反对右翼领导集团政策的提案和发言为数之多表示忧虑。他说：这些提案和发言都是所谓“共产党唆使的”，“这是一种令人十分震惊的情况”。
    苏联“消息报”观察家库德里雅夫采夫评论摩尔坎年会说：工党右翼领导机构越是公开地支持扩军备战政策，它和下层党员群众之间的鸿沟也就愈深。英国帝国主义的右翼工党代理人不管用什么阴谋诡计都决不可能使英国人轻信谎言，英国人民正在愈来愈坚决地要求和平和奉行独立的外交政策。
