Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th: According to TASS, Berlin held a grand demonstration on the 7th, the third National Day of the German Democratic Republic. Six hundred thousand Berlin citizens and many delegations from all over the German Democratic Republic participated in the parade.

　　The streets and squares of the democratic sector of Berlin, especially Marx-Engels Square, were decorated with a completely new look. The reviewing stand was set up in Marx-Engels Square. A huge banner hanging in the square read: "Long live the German Democratic Republic, the fortress of the German people's struggle for peace, unity, democracy and socialism! Long live the powerful socialist Soviet Union - the leader in the struggle for world peace!"

　　When President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic, the head of the Soviet government delegation and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Shvernik, Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic Dieckmann, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany Correns, government officials of the German Democratic Republic, and members of foreign government delegations attending the third National Day ceremony of the German Democratic Republic ascended the reviewing stand, the venue resounded with stormy applause and cheers.

　　Before the demonstration began, Correns delivered a speech. He first paid tribute to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union being held in Moscow, and to the party of Lenin and Stalin, which led the Soviet people to defeat Hitler fascism and liberate the German people from Hitler's tyranny. He thanked Marshal Stalin for his congratulatory telegram on the National Day of the German Democratic Republic, saying: This telegram encourages us and gives us new strength to fight for the peaceful unification of Germany and to fight against the implementation of the militaristic "General Treaty".

　　Then the review began. The parade was led by advanced workers from Berlin and all over the German Democratic Republic. In a sea of flags, the demonstrators marched forward holding aloft portraits of Lenin, Stalin, Thälmann, Pieck, members of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union, and leaders of the international workers' movement.

　　The demonstration powerfully demonstrated the fraternal solidarity between the German people and the various nationalities of the great Soviet Union, the fraternal solidarity between the countries of the camp of peace, democracy and socialism, and showed the close unity between the German people and all progressive forces in the world.

    柏林六十万人示威游行庆祝第三届国庆

    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社柏林八日讯：七日为德意志民主共和国第三届国庆日，这一天，柏林举行了盛大的示威游行，参加游行的有六十万柏林市民和来自德意志民主共和国各地的许多代表团。
    柏林民主区的各街道与各广场，特别是马克思—恩格斯广场，布置得气象一新。检阅台设在马克思—恩格斯广场中。广场上悬挂的巨幅标语上写着：“德意志民主共和国，德国人民为和平、统一、民主与社会主义而斗争的堡垒万岁！强大的社会主义苏联——争取世界和平斗争的领导者万岁！”
    德意志民主共和国总统皮克，苏联政府代表团团长、最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克，德意志民主共和国人民议会主席狄克曼，民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席团主席柯伦斯，德意志民主共和国政府官员及参加德意志民主共和国第三届国庆典礼的外国政府代表团人员登上检阅台时，会场上响起了暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声。
    示威游行开始前，由柯伦斯致词。他首先向正在莫斯科开会的苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会致敬，向领导苏联人民战胜希特勒法西斯主义并把德国人民从希特勒暴政下解放出来的列宁和斯大林的党致敬。他感谢斯大林大元帅祝贺德意志民主共和国国庆的贺电，他说：这封贺电鼓舞我们，给我们以新的力量，为和平统一德国而斗争，为反对实行军事性的“一般性条约”而斗争。
    接着开始检阅。游行队伍以柏林和德意志民主共和国各地的先进工人为前导。在一片旗帜的海洋中，示威游行者高举着列宁、斯大林、台尔曼、皮克、苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会政治局的委员们以及国际工人运动领袖的画像前进。
    示威游行有力地表明了德国人民与伟大苏联的各族人民之间的友爱团结，和平民主和社会主义阵营各个国家之间的友爱团结，并且表明了德国人民与全世界一切进步力量的亲密团结。
