    Travel Notes
    India  Gao Pulan

    Editor's note: Comrade Gao Pulan, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India and leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, who has come to Beijing, is writing "Travel Notes" to be sent to all party newspapers and progressive newspapers in India for publication. The following is a summary of the article he agreed to let us publish.
    Dear comrades and friends:
    We left New Delhi on the evening of the 18th. There were eight of us when we gathered in Delhi, but when we departed from Calcutta, our number increased to eighteen. We flew to
    a great country—this great country has today become the leader and hope of the Asian people. The great Chinese people have made great sacrifices and have achieved noble and great achievements—the establishment of a people's democratic government. Yes, I have not seen any part of China yet, but a quick glance and contact with a few people has made me feel that the actual situation is even better than we had imagined.
    When we arrived at Shenzhen Railway Station on the border, we were led into the reception room. There, I saw two bright and clever girls, one twenty years old and the other twenty-two. One of them was named Hu Lan (transliteration). I learned a Chinese phrase from them: "Thank you." I had to wait two hours there for the train, so I used this time to talk to them. With the help of an interpreter, I talked with them. They were proud of the new China. I asked them why they were proud, so they told me their reasons. Before that, one of them pointed to the photo of Comrade Mao Zedong and said, "Look, our leader. How can people not be happy under his leadership?" Her expression and explanation also moved me very much. She told me that she has two hours of reading time every day and half an hour of collective reading time. Indeed, the Indian working class can learn a lot from the Chinese working class. I asked them both a few questions. I asked them if they understood the Communist Party, and if they were not yet members, why not. They said that they knew that the Party was the leader of the working class, the peasants, and other strata of the people. The liberation struggles of many countries—including China—were led by the Communist Party. But to be a Communist Party member requires great courage, determination, and a spirit of sacrifice. "We have not yet fully possessed such a great spirit of sacrifice, but we are prepared and hope to become a qualified reserve force for the Party."
    We were delighted to hear the young working-class girls talk about Marxism, China, India, and the role of the Indian people in the peace movement.
    Another admirable thing I saw was the discipline of the people. At Guangzhou Railway Station, we were greeted by people. Everyone lined up. The young girls came to us one by one in order to welcome us. They presented us with flowers. As we walked, I saw one of our representatives step out of the line, and later a girl asked the representative to walk with the team. These children are really leading us. Workers walk in line when going to and from work. This disciplined team of Chinese patriotic children will ring the death knell of American imperialism.
    Chinese people, on behalf of the Communist Party of India, I express the respect of the Indian people to you. Peace is important to everyone, and it is especially important to the Asian people. Foreign troops should leave the land of Asia. Whatever disputes there may be between the people of each country, they should be allowed to resolve them themselves. We do not want American or British masters to decide our problems. Each of us should do our best to strive for peace. In this struggle for peace that we are waging, everyone is equal and equally important. If we unite, we can defeat the warmongers. Glory to Mao Zedong and the Chinese people. I must gain more and better experience to benefit myself.
    September 23, Beijing

    旅途随笔
    印度  高普兰
    编者按：来到北京的印度共产党中央委员、国会反对派领袖高普兰正在写“旅途随笔”，准备寄给印度所有党报和进步报纸发表。以下是他同意让我们发表的该文摘要。亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我们于十八日晚间离开新德里。我们在德里集合时一共有八个人，但是当我们从加尔各答出发时，我们的人数增加到了十八个人。我们乘着飞机前往
    一个大国——这个大国在今天已成为亚洲人民的领袖和希望。伟大的中国人民作了极大的牺牲以后，已得到崇高而伟大的成就——成立了人民民主政府。是的，我还没有看到中国的任何地方，但是匆匆的一瞥和跟少数人的接触已使我感觉到实际的情况比我们以往所想像的更好。
    当我们到达边界上的深圳火车站时，我们被引入接待室。在那里，我看到两个聪明伶俐的女郎，一个二十岁，另一个二十二岁。其中一个名叫胡兰
    （译音）。我从她们那里学会了一句中国话：“谢谢”。我在那里等车要花两个钟头，因此我就利用这段时间和她们谈话。在一个译员的帮助下，我和他们谈了起来。她们对新中国感到自豪。我问她们为什么感到自豪，于是她们向我说出她们的理由。在这以前，她们当中有一个人指着毛泽东同志的相片说：“看，我们的领袖。在他领导下，人们怎会不幸福呢？”她的神色和解释也使我很受感动。她告诉我，她每天有两小时的阅读时间，半小时的集体阅读时间。的确，印度工人阶级可以从中国工人阶级那里学到许多东西。我向她们两人提了几个问题。我问她们了解不了解共产党，如果她们还不是党员，为什么不当党员。她们说，她们知道党是工人阶级、农民以及人民中的其他阶层的领袖。许多国家——包括中国在内——的解放斗争都是共产党领导的。但是要做一个共产党员，需要有很大的勇气、决心和牺牲精神。“我们还没有充分具备这样大的牺牲精神，但是我们准备而且希望成为党的合格的后备军。”
    年轻的工人阶级女孩子们谈到马克思主义、中国、印度和印度人民在和平运动中的作用，这使我们感到很愉快。
    我看到的另一件令人钦佩的事情，就是人民的纪律性。在广州车站，有人迎接我们。所有的人都排好队伍。年轻的女孩们一个一个顺次走到我们面前，欢迎我们。她们向我们献花。当我们走动的时候，我看到我们代表当中有一个人走出了队伍，后来有一个女孩请这个代表跟队伍一道走。这些孩子们真的在领导我们呢。工人们上工和下工的时候都是排着队伍走。这一支富有纪律性的中国爱国的儿童队伍将敲起美帝国主义的丧钟。
    中国人民，我谨代表印度共产党向你们表达印度人民的敬意。和平对人人都是重要的，对亚洲人民更是最重要不过。外国军队应当离开亚洲的土地。不管每一个国家的人民之间有甚么纠纷，应当让他们自己解决这种纠纷。我们不希望让美国或英国主子决定我们的问题。我们每一个人都应当尽全力争取和平。在我们进行的这场争取和平的斗争中，人人是平等的，是同等重要的。如果我们联合一致，我们就能够战胜战争贩子。光荣归于毛泽东和中国人民。我必须取得更多更好的经验，从而使自己得到益处。
    九月二十三日于北京
