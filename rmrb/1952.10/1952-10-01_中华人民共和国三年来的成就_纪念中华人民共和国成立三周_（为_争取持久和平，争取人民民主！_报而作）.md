Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its outstanding leader Comrade Mao Zedong, and through the efforts of the entire people for three years, the necessary conditions have been created for planned and large-scale economic and cultural construction. This makes it possible for us to further strive for the industrialization of the country and ensure that our country steadily advances towards socialism through industrialization.

In the past three years, through nationwide mass movements, we have waged resolute struggles against enemies at home and abroad, further consolidating our national independence and unity. We have also completed a series of great democratic reforms with the power of the people, fundamentally changing the face of all aspects of Chinese society, thereby consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class.

China's land reform has been basically completed nationwide. As of August 1952, approximately 300 million landless and land-poor peasants and their families have been allocated approximately 47 million hectares of cultivated land originally belonging to landlords. The landlord class has been eliminated in the vast countryside, and the feudal land ownership system has been abolished. As a result, the people's democratic system has been supported and loved by the majority of the national population, the peasants, and a broad path has been opened up for the development of Chinese industry.

In the past three years, we have eliminated more than two million bandits and imprisoned and controlled a large number of counter-revolutionary agents. Now bandits have disappeared in China, and social order is more stable than ever before.

In late 1951 and the first half of 1952, we carried out the "Three-Anti" movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy among state organ personnel, and the "Five-Anti" movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence among private industrial and commercial enterprises. In this movement, 4.5 percent of state personnel were punished to varying degrees for acts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, with particularly serious cases being subject to legal sanctions. This greatly purified state organs, brought the people's government closer to the working masses, greatly improved discipline and efficiency within the organs, and thereby greatly saved state expenditures. At the same time, through this movement, more than 450,000 private industrial and commercial enterprises were investigated in nine major cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Shenyang. Among them, 76 percent had various degrees of illegal activities. They were all educated on compliance with the law and were appropriately dealt with, with particularly serious cases being subject to legal sanctions. This greatly reduced the illegal activities of the Chinese bourgeoisie and brought their activities into the orbit of working-class leadership and the Common Program. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements further consolidated the leading position of the working class in the state.

In the past three years, we have victoriously carried out the work of consolidating national defense, effectively thwarting the US imperialist plot to invade our country. After the outbreak of the Korean War, the Chinese people launched the great Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Not only did thousands upon thousands of workers, peasants, and intellectuals volunteer to join the army to aid Korea, but the people of the whole country enthusiastically participated in this movement by strengthening agricultural and industrial production and other means. The people donated enough money for 3,700 airplanes for the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign. The surge of patriotism formed by the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has become a driving force for the reform and construction of all aspects of our country.

Combined with the above-mentioned movements, we carried out the ideological remolding movement of intellectuals. The purpose of this movement was to eliminate the influence of the landlord class, the bourgeoisie, and imperialism in the thinking of intellectuals, and to enable them to consciously accept the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism. After this movement, the broad masses of intellectuals became closer to the Communist Party and were able to better serve the country and the people.

In the past three years, our domestic work on ethnic unity has also made great achievements. There are about sixty ethnic minorities in China, with a total population of about 40 million. One hundred and thirty ethnic autonomous regions of varying sizes have been established and will continue to be established. More than 70,000 ethnic minority cadres have been trained from various ethnic minority colleges and cadre training classes. Due to a series of work carried out among the various ethnic minorities, the economic and cultural lives of the various ethnic minorities have been significantly improved, resulting in an unprecedented situation of mutual unity among all ethnic groups in China.

The working people of China have been further organized on a national scale. Now the Chinese trade unions have 7.3 million members, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has 6.3 million members, the All-China Students' Federation has 2.17 million members, 76 million people participate in the activities of the Women's Federation, the supply and marketing cooperatives have 106 million members, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has 26.5 million members. This has formed an extremely broad and strong social pillar for the people's government.

The improvement of the level of consciousness and the consistency of thought and will of the Chinese people are also significantly reflected in the enthusiastic participation of the Chinese people in the world peace movement. Approximately 340 million people signed in support of the Five-Power Pact for Peace and voted against arming Japan.

In the past three years, our country has also achieved great achievements on the economic front.

When the Chinese People's Liberation War achieved victory across the country in 1949, the national economy we faced was devastated by the rampant destruction of Japanese imperialism, the plundering by the Kuomintang tyranny, and the looting by US imperialism, leaving it riddled with holes. In the newly liberated areas, the countryside was bankrupt, many factories and mines were closed down, speculation was rampant, the market was chaotic, and the people's lives had reached the end of their rope. After we destroyed the rule of the US imperialist running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, we had to use great strength to overcome the difficulties caused by this dilapidated economic situation. We relied on the working class and the broad masses of the people to restore agricultural and industrial production in a step-by-step manner. From March 1950, we adopted a series of effective measures to bring the fiscal revenue and expenditure close to balance, stop inflation, and stabilize prices. In half a year, the market situation began to improve, but its foundation was not solid and it was not a fundamental improvement.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in June 1950: In order to achieve a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation, it would take about three years. Advancing according to the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, and through the efforts of the people of the whole country, the Chinese financial and economic situation has been fundamentally improved in less than three years. China's industrial and agricultural production has now fully recovered and exceeded the highest level before the war, the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure have been completely balanced, and prices have been completely stabilized.

The recovery and development of China's agricultural production can be expressed by the following figures. If the highest output of various agricultural products before liberation is taken as 100, then the projected output that can be guaranteed in 1952 is: grain 109, cotton 155, hemp 559, flue-cured tobacco 294, and sugar crops 113.

In the past three years, the Party and the people's government, on the basis of the land reform movement, have actively led and helped farmers to develop production in various ways, and have further led farmers to organize various forms of labor mutual aid organizations under the principle of voluntariness. In 1952, more than 40 percent of the farmers across the country participated in labor mutual aid groups, and 70 to 80 percent in the old liberated areas. There have also been more than 4,000 agricultural production cooperatives that are more advanced than mutual aid groups and more than a dozen exemplary collective farms. The mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production has become a national upsurge, which is the main direction of development of China's agricultural production.

We have carried out many huge water conservancy construction projects in these three years. The amount of earthwork completed in water conservancy projects is more than 1.7 billion cubic meters, which is equivalent to the earthwork completed by ten Panama Canals or twenty-three Suez Canals. The people's government's investment in water conservancy construction in 1952 was 52 times the highest year of investment by the Kuomintang government in this area. As a result of water conservancy construction and the struggle against other natural disasters, the area of farmland affected by disasters in China has been greatly reduced. The area affected by disasters in 1949 was 8 million hectares, which was reduced to 4.6 million hectares in 1950, and further reduced to 1.4 million hectares in 1951, and even less in 1952.

The rapid recovery of agricultural production is the result of these efforts.

China's industrial production has also recovered and developed rapidly, which can be illustrated by the following figures. If the highest output of various industrial and mining products before liberation is taken as 100, then the projected output that can be guaranteed in 1952 is: pig iron 104, steel ingots 155, coal 90, electricity 115, petroleum 136, cement 148, and timber 136. From this, it can be seen that in many basic industries, except for coal, we have exceeded the highest record in Chinese history. The projected output of many other consumer goods and daily necessities in 1952 has also reached and exceeded the highest record in history. According to the same calculation method, cotton yarn is 144, cotton cloth is 161, flour is 106, sugar is 100, paper is 234, cigarettes are 145, and matches are 111, etc.

In the development of industry, the ratio of the production of means of production to the production of consumer goods has changed in the past three years. In 1949, the means of production accounted for 32.5 percent of the total industrial output value, and consumer goods accounted for 67.5 percent. In 1952, the means of production had increased to 43.8 percent, while consumer goods had decreased to 56.2 percent.

In the past three years, we have universally implemented a thorough democratic reform movement in state-owned factories and mining enterprises, and established a new management system suitable for the socialist production relations of state-owned enterprises.

On the basis of the democratic reform movement in state-owned enterprises, labor competitions, rationalization proposals, and movements to increase production and practice economy have been gradually launched among the broad masses of workers, and the economic accounting system has been promoted. Learning from the Soviet Union's experience has formed a huge trend in our enterprises.

As a result of these efforts, the production of our state-owned enterprises has recovered rapidly, and the labor productivity of workers has greatly improved.

The above-mentioned industrial production figures also include private enterprises. After liberation, great changes have taken place in the labor-capital relations in private capitalist enterprises, the management system in these enterprises has been reformed to some extent, and the lives of workers have been improved.

China still allows the existence of private capitalist economy at this stage, but the proportion of state-owned enterprises in the entire industry is constantly increasing. In the total industrial output in 1949, private enterprises accounted for 56.2 percent, and state-owned enterprises only accounted for 43.8 percent. In the total industrial output in 1952, state-owned enterprises accounted for 67.3 percent, while private enterprises only accounted for 32.7 percent. This situation does not indicate that private enterprises have not developed in their absolute volume. Since China's modern industry currently accounts for only a small proportion of the entire national economy, the development of private enterprises to a certain extent is necessary. However, state-owned enterprises will have greater development, and its proportion will continue to grow rapidly and firmly occupy a leading position.

In terms of transportation, we have also done a great job. Taking railways as an example, in the past three years, a total of more than 10,000 kilometers of railways have been repaired across the country, and 1,255 kilometers of railways have been newly built. Now the total operating lines in the country are 23,785 kilometers. In terms of highways, in the past three years, a total of 32,438 kilometers have been renovated and 11,000 kilometers have been newly built. Now the total operating lines are 107,438 kilometers. If the planned transportation volume in 1952 is compared with the highest year of transportation volume before liberation, railways are 161 percent and highways are 112 percent.

In terms of domestic trade, due to our work on urban-rural material exchange across the country, the stagnant state of urban-rural exchange caused by long-term war and inflation during the Kuomintang reactionary rule in the past has been completely changed. The total domestic trade volume in 1951 was 130 percent of that in 1950. It is estimated that it can reach 170 percent of that in 1950 in 1952. In terms of foreign trade, we have received assistance from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and it has also increased year by year.

The proportion of public and private sectors in trade has also changed in the same way as in industry. In the past three years, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce have developed greatly. Therefore, the proportion of public and private sectors in trade has changed from 44.4 to 55.6 in 1950 to 62.9 to 37.1 in 1952.

In terms of national financial work, we have achieved unified management of national local finances by the central government, which has greatly improved the national financial situation and can therefore adapt to the development of economic undertakings.

In the past three years, our country's total revenue and total expenditure have increased every year. Compared with the actual revenue and expenditure of the country in 1951, the budget revenue in 1952 increased by 41.66 percent, and the budget expenditure increased by 55.52 percent. In our country's total revenue, the proportion of state-owned enterprises' profits and depreciation income has increased year by year. Due to the development of industry and commerce, the proportion of agricultural tax revenue in the country's total revenue has relatively decreased. In order to enable the countryside to properly recuperate and improve the enthusiasm of farmers for production, we began to reduce the agricultural tax rate in 1952 to reduce the burden on farmers.

As mentioned earlier, our country's revenue and expenditure were close to balance in 1950. In the subsequent period, due to the frenzied aggression of US imperialism, we had to use great strength to strengthen national defense construction and support the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign. Despite this, our country's fiscal revenue and expenditure in 1951 and 1952 were not only able to maintain balance but also had surpluses. Therefore, we were able to not only completely stabilize finance and prices, but also carry out necessary construction investments for economic recovery. In 1952, more than 50 percent of our country's total budget was used for economic construction and cultural and educational construction.

All of this shows that our national economy has fully recovered and is moving forward on the road to construction and prosperity by leaps and bounds.

The material and cultural lives and public health conditions of our people have been significantly improved in the past three years.

The achievements we have made in economic work in the past three years are significantly reflected in the improvement of people's lives.

In 1952, the average wage of employees in various regions of the country increased by 60 to 120 percent compared with 1949. The wage income of workers has generally reached or exceeded the level before the Anti-Japanese War. Since 1951, the labor insurance system has been universally implemented in factories and mining enterprises with more than 100 employees across the country.

The people's purchasing power has greatly increased. The purchasing power of the people across the country increased by about 25 percent in 1951 compared with 1950.

The sales volume of various major means of livelihood has greatly increased. For example, the sales volume of cotton yarn increased by 32 percent in 1951 compared with 1950; it is estimated that it will increase by another 30 percent in 1952 compared with 1951, an increase of 59 percent compared with the highest annual sales volume during the Kuomintang rule. The sales volume of coal increased by 15 percent in 1951 compared with 1950; it is estimated that it will increase by 22 percent in 1952 compared with 1951, an increase of 41 percent compared with the highest annual sales volume during the Kuomintang rule. The amount of grain supplied to the market by the state increased by 70 percent in 1951 compared with 1950, and it is estimated that it will increase by 59 percent in 1952 compared with 1951. The total social sales volume of other fabrics, meat, cigarettes, and salt has also increased a lot compared with the highest year during the Kuomintang rule.

Our education has been reformed and developed. The living expenses of all students in universities, secondary technical schools, normal schools, and workers' and peasants' secondary schools are all provided by the state, and the number of people who receive scholarships among middle school students has also been expanded. This allows the children of workers and peasants to have the opportunity to enjoy secondary and higher education.

The figures for students in schools at all levels in 1952 and their ratio to the highest figures in the Kuomintang era (with the highest figures in the Kuomintang era taken as 100) are as follows: more than 218,000 university students, 169.9 percent; 3.07 million secondary school students, 163.9 percent; 49 million primary school students, 207 percent.

The news and publishing industry, the film industry, the broadcasting industry, and various mass cultural activities have greatly developed. The movement to eliminate illiteracy has been promoted in all regions of the country.

The health cause has been greatly developed, which is reflected in the gradual popularization of medical and health work in industrial and mining areas and rural areas. By the end of 1951, 91.2 percent of the counties in the country had established health centers. In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, in order to oppose the US imperialist germ warfare, the people of the whole country carried out a patriotic health movement, clearing a large amount of garbage accumulated for many years in half a year, repairing countless dirty ditches, and eliminating flies, mosquitoes, and rats in many cities and villages, thus further improving the health of the people.

Obviously, with the higher development of economic undertakings in the future, our cultural and educational undertakings will have a larger-scale development.

The achievements in all aspects of our country in the past three years show that the recovery phase of our country has passed, and large-scale economic construction is about to begin.

We will begin planned economic construction in 1953 while continuing to support the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign and continuing to strengthen national defense.

The rapid and great achievements we have made in all aspects of the recovery work in the past three years are inseparable from the selfless assistance of our great friendly country, the Soviet Union, and the friendly cooperation of various people's democratic countries. In the future, in our construction undertakings, this assistance and cooperation will also play a major role.

Large-scale economic construction is a new thing for our entire Party and the entire people. We clearly know that in order to do everything well, the most important thing is to be good at learning, especially learning from the Soviet Union. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his famous paper "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "We must overcome difficulties, we must learn things we don't understand... The CPSU is our best teacher, and we must learn from the CPSU." This is what Comrade Mao Zedong taught us three years ago, and this is our guideline. We have not yet generally learned construction. Following this instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong, we firmly believe that we will be able to overcome any difficulties in the course of economic construction, turn China into an industrialized country, and, on the basis of the great development of industry, collectivize agriculture and steadily advance towards socialism.

    中华人民共和国三年来的成就
    ——纪念中华人民共和国成立三周年
    （为“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”报而作）
    薄一波
    中华人民共和国成立以来，在中国共产党及其杰出的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，经过了全体人民三年的努力，已经为有计划地进行大规模的经济建设和文化建设创造了必要的条件，使我们有可能进一步为国家工业化而奋斗，并确保我们国家经过工业化而向着社会主义稳步前进。
    三年来，我们曾通过全国范围的广大人民群众的运动，向国外和国内的敌人进行了坚决的斗争，进一步地巩固了我们国家的独立和统一；并且用人民群众的力量完成了一系列的伟大的民主改革工作，使中国社会各方面的面貌发生了根本的变化，因而巩固了以工人阶级为领导的人民民主专政。
    中国的土地改革已经在全国范围内基本完成。截至一九五二年八月止，约有三万万本来无地和少地的农民及其家属分得了约四千七百万公顷原来属于地主的耕地。在广大的农村中消灭了地主阶级，消灭了封建的土地所有制，结果就使得人民民主制度受到占全国人口中最大多数的农民的拥护和爱戴，并且为中国工业的发展开辟了广阔的道路。
    在三年间，我们消灭了二百万以上的土匪，并监禁和管制了大量的反革命特务分子，现在土匪已经在中国绝迹，社会秩序空前安定。
    在一九五一年底和一九五二年上半年，我们在国家机关的工作人员中，进行了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的“三反”运动，又在私营工商业中，进行了反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料和反盗窃国家经济情报的“五反”运动。在这次运动中，有百分之四点五的国家工作人员因为有不同程度的贪污、浪费和官僚主义的行为而受到不同程度的处分，特别严重的并受到法律的制裁；这样就大大地纯洁了国家机关，使人民政府和劳动人民群众的联系更加密切，使机关内部的纪律性和工作效率大为提高，并从而使国家开支大为节省。同时，通过这个运动，在北京、上海、天津、汉口、广州、沈阳等九大城市审查了四十五万多户私营工商业者，其中百分之七十六曾有各种不同程度的违法行为，对他们都进行了守法的教育，并作了适当的处理，其中特别严重的并予以法律制裁；这样就使中国资产阶级的违法行为大大减少，把他们的活动纳入工人阶级领导和共同纲领的轨道上来。“三反”“五反”运动进一步地巩固了工人阶级在国家中的领导地位。
    三年来，我们胜利地进行了巩固国防的工作，有力地阻止了美帝国主义侵略我国的阴谋。在朝鲜战争发生以后，中国人民进行了伟大的抗美援朝运动，不但有成千成万的工人、农民、知识分子报名志愿参军援朝，而且全国人民都用加强农业和工业的生产及其他方式热烈地参加了这个运动。人民捐献抗美援朝的飞机达三千七百架。由抗美援朝运动而形成的爱国主义的高涨成为我们国家各方面的改革和建设事业的推动力量。
    和上述各项运动相结合，我们进行了知识分子的思想改造的运动。这个运动的目的是清除知识分子在思想上的地主阶级及资产阶级的影响和帝国主义的影响，并使他们能够自觉地接受马克思列宁主义的观点。经过这个运动，广大知识分子更加向共产党靠拢，能够更好地为国家和人民事业服务。
    三年来，我们国内的民族团结工作也有很大的成绩。全中国约有少数民族六十个，人口共约四千万，现已建立规模不同的民族自治区一百三十个单位，并仍将继续建立。从各种民族学院及干部训练班中已训练出民族干部七万多人。由于在各少数民族中进行了一系列的工作，各少数民族的经济生活和文化生活已有显著的提高，因而在中国出现了空前未有的各民族互相团结的局面。
    中国的劳动人民已在全国规模上进一步地组织了起来。现在中国工会已有七百三十万会员，中国新民主主义青年团有六百三十万团员，中国学生联合会有二百一十七万会员，参加妇女联合会活动的有七千六百万人，供销合作社有一亿零六百万社员，中苏友好协会有二千六百五十万会员，这就形成了人民政府的极为广大坚强的社会支柱。
    中国人民的觉悟程度的提高和思想意志的一致性也显著地表现在中国人民热烈地参加世界和平运动中。签名拥护五大国缔结和平公约和投票反对武装日本的人各在三万万四千万人左右。
    三年来，我们国家在经济战线上也同样取得了巨大的成就。
    当一九四九年中国人民解放战争在全国取得胜利的时候，我们所面对着的国民经济是在日本帝国主义大肆破坏之后，又受到国民党暴政的洗劫和美帝国主义的掠夺，以致到处都是百孔千疮。在刚解放的地区，农村破产，许多工厂矿山歇业，投机猖狂，市场混乱，人民的生活已到了山穷水尽的地步。我们在摧毁了美帝国主义走狗——国民党反动派统治之后，曾不得不用很大的力量来克服这种残破的经济情况所造成的困难。我们依靠工人阶级和广大人民群众有步骤地恢复农业和工业的生产，并从一九五○年三月份起，通过了一系列的有效的措施，才使财政收支接近平衡，使通货膨胀停止，使物价趋向稳定，在半年时间内就使市场情况开始好转，但它的基础还不巩固，还不是根本的好转。
    毛泽东同志在一九五○年六月在中共中央七届三中全会上指出：为了获得财政经济情况的根本好转，大约需要三年时间。按照毛泽东同志的指示前进，通过全国人民的努力，在不到三年的时间内已使中国财政经济情况根本好转了。中国工农业生产现已全部恢复和超过战前最高的水平，国家财政收支已完全平衡，物价已完全稳定。
    中国农业生产的恢复和发展，可以用下列的数字表现出来。如果把各项农产品在解放前产量最高的一年作为一○○，那么一九五二年有保证可以达到的预计产量就是：粮食为一○九，棉花为一五五，麻为五五九，烤烟为二九四，糖料为一一三。
    三年来，党与人民政府在土地改革运动的基础上，用各种方法积极领导和帮助农民发展生产，并且进一步领导农民在自愿的原则下进行各种形式的劳动互助的组织。一九五二年参加劳动互助组的农民达全国农民的百分之四十以上，老解放区则达百分之七十到八十，并且已经有了四千多个比互助组更进一步的农业生产合作社和十几处示范性的集体农庄。农业生产中的互助合作运动，业已成为全国的高潮，这是中国农业生产主要的发展方向。
    我们在这三年来进行了许多巨大的水利建设工程。在水利工程上所完成的土方有十七亿公方以上，这等于十条巴拿马运河或二十三条苏彝士运河所完成的土方。一九五二年人民政府在水利建设上的投资等于国民党政府在这方面投资最高的一年的五十二倍。由于兴修水利及向其他天然灾害斗争的结果，中国农田受灾的面积大为减少，一九四九年受灾面积为八百万公顷，一九五○年减为四百六十万公顷，一九五一年再减为一百四十万公顷，一九五二年则更少。
    农业生产的迅速恢复就是这些工作的结果。
    中国的工业生产也已迅速恢复和发展，这可以用如下的数字来表明。如果把各项工矿业产品在解放前产量最高的一年作为一○○    ，那么一九五二年有保证可以达到的预计产量就是：生铁为一○四，钢锭为一五五，煤为九○，电力为一一五，石油为一三六，水泥为一四八，木材为一三六。由此可见，在许多基本工业中，除了煤，我们都已超过了中国历史上的最高纪录。其他许多消费资料和生活资料的工业品的一九五二年的预计产量，也达到和超过了历史上的最高纪录。按照同样的计算方法，棉纱为一四四，棉布为一六一，面粉为一○六，食糖为一○○，纸张为二三四，卷烟为一四五，火柴为一一一等等。
    在工业的发展中，生产手段的生产量与消费资料的生产量的比例，三年来已发生变化。一九四九年生产手段占工业总产值的百分之三十二点五，消费资料占百分之六十七点五，一九五二年生产手段已增至百分之四十三点八，消费资料则减至百分之五十六点二。
    三年来，我们在国营的工厂矿山企业中普遍地实行了彻底的民主改革运动，建立了适合于国营企业的社会主义生产关系的新的管理制度。
    在国营企业中的民主改革运动的基础上，在广大的工人群众中逐步地展开了劳动竞赛、合理化建议和增产节约的运动，推行了经济核算制。学习苏联的经验，在我们的企业中形成了巨大的潮流。
    这些工作的结果就使我们的国营企业的生产迅速恢复，工人的劳动生产率有了很大的提高。
    上述的工业生产数字也包含私营企业在内。在解放后，私人资本主义企业中的劳资关系发生了很大的变化，这些企业内的管理制度已有所改革，工人生活获得了改善。
    中国在现阶段还允许私人资本主义经济的存在，但国营企业在全部工业中所占比重是在不断的增长中。在一九四九年的工业总产量中，私营占百分之五十六点二，国营只占百分之四十三点八。在一九五二年的工业总产量中，国营已占百分之六十七点三，而私营只占百分之三十二点七。这种情形并不表明私营企业在其绝对量上没有发展。由于中国目前近代化工业在整个国民经济中还只占很小的比重，私营企业在一定程度内的发展是必要的。但国营企业将有更大的发展，它的比重将要不断地迅速地增长，而巩固地居于领导的地位。
    在交通运输方面，我们也做了巨大的工作。以铁路来说，三年来，全国共修复一万余公里的铁路，同时又新建了铁路一千二百五十五公里。现在全国通车线路共为二万三千七百八十五公里。以公路来说，三年来全国共整修三万二千四百三十八公里，新建一万一千公里，现在通车线路共为十万七千四百三十八公里。如果以一九五二年的计划运输量与解放前运输量最高的一年相较，铁路为百分之一六一，公路为百分之一一二。
    在国内贸易方面，由于我们在全国范围内进行了城乡物资交流的工作，已完全改变了过去国民党反动统治时代长期因战争和通货膨胀所造成的城乡交流停滞状态。一九五一年国内贸易总额为一九五○年的百分之一三○。一九五二年预计可达到一九五○年的百分之一七○。在国外贸易方面，我们得到了苏联和各人民民主国家的协助，也逐年增长。
    在贸易上的公私比重也和在工业上一样，发生了同样的变化。三年来，国营的商业和合作社的商业都有了很大的发展，因此在贸易上的公私比重就从
    一九五○年的四十四点四比五十五点六变为一九五二年的六十二点九比三十七点一。
    在国家财政工作方面，我们已做到全国地方财政统一地归中央管理，这样就使得国家财政状况大为改善，因而能够适应经济事业的发展。
    三年来，我们国家的总收入与总支出每年都增长。和一九五一年度的国家的实际的收入和支出相比较，一九五二年的预算收入增加了百分之四十一点六六，预算支出则增加了百分之五十五点五二。在我们的国家总收入中，国营企业利润及折旧收入部分所占比重逐年增加。由于工商业的发展，农业税收在国家总收入中所占比重已相对地降低。为了使得农村能够恰当地得到休养生息，提高农民生产积极性，在一九五二年我们开始降低农业的税率，以减轻农民的负担。
    我们国家的收支，如前所说，在一九五○年已经接近了平衡。以后的时期中，由于美帝国主义的疯狂侵略，我们不得不用很大的力量加强国防的建设并支援抗美援朝。虽然如此，我们的国家财政收支在一九五一年和一九五二年不但能保持平衡而且还有结余，因而我们既能够使金融物价完全达到稳定，又能为恢复经济而进行必要的建设投资。在一九五二年，我们的国家总预算中，已有百分之五十以上的经费用于经济建设和文化教育建设。
    所有这一切都说明，我们的国民经济已经全面恢复，并且大踏步地在向着建设和繁荣的道路前进。
    我国人民的物质生活和文化生活及公共卫生条件，在这三年来都有了显著的提高。
    我们三年来在经济工作上所达到的成绩显著地反映在人民生活的改进上。
    一九五二年全国各地区职工的平均工资比一九四九年增加了百分之六十至一百二十，工人的工资收入一般已达到或超过抗日战争以前的水平。从一九五一年起，全国一百个职工以上的工厂矿山企业已普遍地实行了劳动保险制度。
    人民的购买力有很大提高。全国人民在一九五一年的购买力比一九五○年提高百分之二十五左右。
    各种主要的生活资料的销售量有很大的增长，例如，棉纱销售量一九五一年比一九五○年增加百分之三十二；一九五二年预计将比一九五一年又增加百分之三十，较之国民党统治时最高年销量增加百分之五十九。煤炭销售量一九五一年比一九五○年增加百分之十五；一九五二年预计将比一九五一年增加百分之二十二，比国民党统治时期最高年销量增加百分之四十一。国家对市场供应粮食的数量一九五一年比一九五○年增加百分之七十，一九五二年预计将比一九五一年增加百分之五十九。其他布匹、肉类、纸烟、食盐的社会销售总量，亦均比国民党统治时期最高年份增加很多。
    我们的教育事业已有了改革和发展。所有高等学校、中等技术学校、师范学校、工农速成中学全部学生的生活费用，均由国家供给，中学生中得到助学金的人数也已扩大。这就使得工人和农民的子女也有享受中等的和高等的教育的机会。
    一九五二年各级学校的学生的数字及它们与国民党时代的最高数字的比例（以国民党时代最高数字作为一百）如下：高等学校学生为二十一万八千多人，百分之一六九点九；中等学校学生为三百零七万人，百分之一六三点九；小学校学生为四千九百万人，百分之二○七。
    新闻出版事业、电影事业、广播事业、各种群众文化活动都有很大发展。扫除文盲运动已在全国各地区推行。
    卫生事业已有很大的发展，这表现在医药卫生工作在工矿区和农村中逐渐普及。到一九五一年底全国已有百分之九十一点二的县份设立了卫生院。在抗美援朝运动中，为反对美帝国主义细菌战，全国人民又进行了爱国卫生运动，在半年内清除了大量的和多年积累的垃圾，修整了无数脏水沟，在许多城市和乡村中消灭了苍蝇、蚊子和老鼠等物，这样就使人民的健康有了进一步的改善。
    显然，伴随着今后经济事业的更高的发展，我国文教事业将要有更大规模的发展。
    三年来，我国各方面的成就表明：我们国家恢复的阶段已经过去，大规模的经济建设即将开始。
    我们将在继续支援抗美援朝，继续加强国防的情况下，于一九五三年开始有计划的经济建设。
    过去三年来我们在恢复工作上迅速得到各方面的巨大成就，和我们伟大的友邦苏联对我们的无私的援助以及各人民民主国家对我们的友好合作是分不开来的。今后在我们的建设事业中，这种援助与合作也将起重大的作用。
    大规模的经济建设对于我们全党和全体人民说来，都是新的事情。我们清楚地知道，为了办好一切事情，最重要的是要善于学习，尤其是向苏联学习。毛泽东同志在其著名的论文“论人民民主专政”中指出：“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西……联共就是我们的最好的先生，我们必须向联共学习。”这是毛泽东同志在三年以前教导我们的，这就是我们的指针。我们还一般没有学会建设，遵循着毛泽东同志的这一指示前进，我们深信一定能够克服经济建设途程中的任何困难，把中国变成工业国，并且在工业大大发展的基础上，把农业集体化，稳步地向社会主义前进。
