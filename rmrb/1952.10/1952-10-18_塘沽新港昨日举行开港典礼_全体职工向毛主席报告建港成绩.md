Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 17th. The first phase of the Tanggu New Port construction project has been completed two and a half months ahead of schedule. The first ten-thousand-ton class ship, the "Changchun," entered the port at 1:10 PM on the 17th. This is the first large-scale commercial port built by the Chinese people with their own strength, and it is of great significance for the development of maritime transport and the promotion of domestic and foreign trade.

The opening ceremony of Tanggu New Port was solemnly held at the No. 1 Wharf of the New Port on the morning of the 17th. The conference was presided over by Wu De, Deputy Mayor of Tianjin. Those who attended the ceremony included Zhang Bojun, Minister of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government; Wang Shoudao, Deputy Minister; Yang Fangzhi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government; Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing; Huang Huoqing, Acting Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China; Zhou Shutao, Deputy Mayor of Tianjin; Li Zhuchen, Director of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce; responsible persons of the Maritime Transport Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government; representatives from the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and other units; and more than 4,600 employees who participated in the port construction project. Soviet expert Bashkevich and others were also invited to participate.

At the meeting, Zhou Lun, Deputy Director of the New Port Engineering Bureau, reported on the construction process, followed by a speech by Zhang Bojun. He first expressed his respect on behalf of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government to the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, the people of Tianjin, and all employees of the New Port. He said: After the opening of the New Port, it will have a significant impact on the future exchange of materials between the north and south, the development of international trade, and the development of resources in North and Northwest China. This is a manifestation of the great strength of China's peaceful construction. In the past, the operation and construction of China's coastal ports were controlled by imperialism and used to plunder the wealth of the Chinese people. Today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and under the guidance of Soviet experts and advanced Soviet experience, the Chinese people have overcome numerous difficulties and successfully completed the first phase of the New Port construction project. This shows that the people of New China are capable of overcoming all difficulties. Finally, he called on all employees of the New Port to make persistent efforts, avoid arrogance and impetuosity, continue to give full play to their labor enthusiasm and creativity, and better complete the second phase of the New Port construction project. Then, Tan Zhen, Chief Engineer of the New Port Engineering Bureau, Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Li Wanlun, representative of the Navy Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Song Jiuzeng, a model worker in port construction, and others delivered speeches successively.

At 1:10 PM, the "Changchun" ship, decorated with colorful flags, was guided by five colorful boats, riding the wind and waves, and entered the port amidst the sound of whistles and cheers, and docked at the No. 1 Wharf. Representatives from all walks of life who participated in the ceremony, led by Minister Zhang Bojun, gathered at the dock to welcome the ship. On the ship and ashore, the sound of firecrackers, cheers, and gongs and drums were all mixed together. When Minister Zhang Bojun cut the ribbon, a group of peace doves flew from the crowd into the sea and sky, symbolizing the great victory of peaceful construction in New China. Thus, the conference ended in cheers.

According to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's plan in his "The International Development of China", he had planned to build a large northern port in the Bohai Bay, but it was never realized. In order to plunder resources from North China, Japanese imperialism built a port here, spending a lot of wealth, but the completed port could only berth ships of 3,000 tons. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, not only was the port not maintained, but when they fled, they arbitrarily destroyed the port equipment and robbed a large number of ships and materials, turning the port into ruins. After liberation, all employees of Tanggu New Port, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, carried out maintenance and key repair work. In August last year, the State Council of the Central People's Government decided to vigorously build the New Port. Over the past year, all employees have displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and completed the first phase of the port construction project two and a half months ahead of schedule than originally planned.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 17th. At the celebration meeting for the opening of the New Port, all employees of Tanggu New Port passed a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting on the completion of the first phase of the New Port construction project. The letter stated: "Thanks to the correct leadership of the higher authorities, the help of Soviet experts, and the enthusiastic support of various relevant departments and the broad masses of the people, although we encountered many difficulties in the port construction work, we finally, with the close unity of workers and technicians, made the difficulties fall one by one in front of us. We have put forward 1,949 rationalization proposals and created 1,280 new records. In terms of management, we have established 312 types of responsibility systems, 103 technical operating procedures, and 516 quotas. In the third quarter, we also implemented group economic accounting, strengthened planning management and cost management, and laid the foundation for implementing a preliminary economic accounting system. Therefore, we were not only able to complete this arduous task two and a half months ahead of schedule, but also saved the country 14.2 billion yuan in funds." The letter said: "Imperialist countries once looked down on us, thinking that we were not capable of building our own seaports. Today, we answer them with our victory. We declare to the world: the liberated Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you and the Central People's Government, are not only able to build their own seaports here, but also to build more seaports on other coasts of the motherland." The letter concluded: "Although we have achieved a great victory in the port construction project, we must never be arrogant and complacent. We must, under your glorious banner, strive to learn from advanced Soviet experience, strengthen the management of the port construction project, improve our technical and business level, and be ready at all times to better complete another port construction task assigned to us by the motherland and the people, and welcome the upcoming large-scale economic construction."

    塘沽新港昨日举行开港典礼
    全体职工向毛主席报告建港成绩
    【新华社天津十七日电】塘沽新港第一期修建工程，已提前两个半月完成。第一艘万吨级的“长春号”轮船在十七日下午一点十分入港。这是我国人民以自己力量修建起来的第一个规模宏大的商港，对发展海上运输和促进国内外贸易有很大意义。
    塘沽新港开港典礼，十七日上午在新港第一号码头隆重举行。大会由天津市人民政府副市长吴德主持。参加典礼的有中央人民政府交通部部长章伯钧、副部长王首道，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会副秘书长杨放之，中国科学院副院长竺可桢，北京市人民政府副市长吴晗，中共天津市委员会代理书记黄火青，天津市人民政府副市长周叔弢，天津市工商界联合会主任李烛尘及中央人民政府交通部海运管理总局负责人，中国人民解放军司令部等单位代表，和参加建港工程的职工等四千六百多人。苏联专家巴希维奇等也应邀参加。
    会上，新港工程局副局长周纶报告了建港经过，接着章伯钧讲话。他首先代表中央人民政府交通部向天津市人民政府、天津市人民和新港全体职工致敬。他说：新港开港后，对今后南北物资交流和国际贸易的发展，以及华北、西北资源的开发将有重大影响。这是我国和平建设伟大力量的表现。过去我国沿海港湾的经营和建设都操纵在帝国主义手里，用来掠夺中国人民的财富。今天中国人民在毛主席、中国共产党领导下，在苏联专家和苏联先进经验的指导下，克服了重重困难，胜利完成了新港第一期建港工程。这说明新中国的人民是能够克服一切困难的。最后他号召新港全体职工再接再厉，不骄不懈，继续发挥劳动积极性和创造性，更好地完成新港第二期建港工程。接着由新港工程局总工程师谭真、中国科学院副院长竺可桢、中国人民解放军海军司令部代表李挽沦、建港劳动模范宋久增等相继致词。
    下午一时十分，装饰得五彩缤纷的“长春号”轮船，由五艘彩船导引，乘风破浪，在汽笛声、欢呼声中驶入港内，停靠第一号码头。参加典礼的各界代表在章伯钧部长率领下，齐集码头迎接。船上，岸上，鞭炮声、欢呼声、锣鼓声连成一片。在章伯钧部长剪彩时，一群和平鸽在人群中飞向海空，象征着新中国和平建设的伟大胜利。至此，大会在欢呼声中结束。
    按孙中山先生在他的“建国方略”中，曾计划在渤海湾修建一个北方大港，始终未能实现。日本帝国主义为了掠夺华北物资，曾在这里修建港口，耗费了大量财富，修成的港口仅仅能停泊三千吨的轮船。国民党反动统治时期，对港口不但没有进行保养，且于逃窜时，将港口设备任意破坏，并抢走大量船只和物资，使港口成为一片废墟。解放后，塘沽新港全体职工在共产党和人民政府领导下，进行了维护保养和重点修补工作。去年八月，中央人民政府政务院决定大力修建新港。一年多来，全体职工发挥了高度的劳动热情，比原订计划提前两个半月完成了第一期建港工程。
    【新华社天津十七日电】塘沽新港全体职工在庆祝新港开港典礼大会上，通过上毛主席书，报告新港第一期建港工程完成情况。信中说：“由于上级的正确领导、苏联专家的帮助、各有关部门和广大人民的热烈支援，我们在建港工作中虽然遇到过不少困难，但终于在工人和技术人员的紧密团结下，使困难一个个地在我们的面前倒下去。我们曾提出了一千九百四十九件合理化建议，创造了一千二百八十件新纪录。在管理方面，我们建立了各种责任制三百一十二项、技术作业规程一百零三件、定额五百一十六项。在第三季度中，我们又推行了小组经济核算，加强了计划管理和成本管理，打下了实行初步经济核算制的基础。所以我们不但能够提前两个半月完成这一艰巨的任务，而且为国家节省了一百四十二亿元的资金。”信中说：“帝国主义国家曾经轻视我们，以为我们没有能力自己建筑海港。今天，我们以我们的胜利回答了它们。我们向全世界宣布：解放了的中国人民，在中国共产党和您以及中央人民政府的领导下，不但能够在这里建筑起自己的海港，并且还要在祖国其他的海岸上建筑起更多的海港。”信中最后说：“我们虽然在建港工程中取得了伟大的胜利，但是我们决不骄傲自满，我们一定要在您的光辉旗帜下，努力学习苏联先进经验，加强建港工程的管理工作，提高技术和业务水平，时刻准备更好地完成祖国和人民交给我们的另一建港任务，迎接即将到来的大规模经济建设。”
