    Attention Should Be Paid to Promoting Warm Water Seed Soaking Method in Naked Oat Producing Areas

    To the Editor: Farmers in Shenchi, Fangshan and other areas in northern Shanxi Province, when planting naked oats this year, changed to using the warm water seed soaking method instead of mixing seeds with wine, saving a lot of money and improving the efficiency of disease and pest control.

    According to statistics from sixteen counties including Shenchi and Fangshan, a total of more than 1,670,000 mu of naked oats were planted this year, and those using warm water soaking and sulfur powder mixing accounted for 40 percent of the sown area. According to inspections, the incidence of naked oat smut decreased from 20 percent to 3 or 4 percent, and 2 billion RMB was saved on the purchase of wine. In August, Shenchi County organized 140 county-level labor models, village cadres, and activists to visit two experimental plots personally handled by county labor model Han Fushuan: naked oats mixed with wine were 3.6 chi tall, with an average incidence rate of 9 percent; naked oats soaked in warm water were 4.2 chi tall, with no diseased plants; the untreated had an incidence rate of 99 percent. This fact greatly educated the masses, dispelled the masses' concerns about "scalding the seeds to death" and fear of "soft stalks," and promoted the development of this work.

    莜麦产区应注意推广温汤浸种法
    编辑同志：山西北部神池、方山等地区的农民，今年种植莜麦的时候，改用温汤浸种，代替用酒拌种，节省了很多钱，还提高了防治病虫害的效率。
    据神池、方山等十六县的统计，今年共种莜麦一百六十七万多亩，采用温汤浸种、硫磺粉拌种的占播种面积的百分之四十。据检查，莜麦黑穗病发病率由百分之二十降低至百分之三、四，而且节省了买酒用的人民币二十亿元。神池县于八月间组织了全县劳动模范、村干部、积极分子一百四十人，参观县劳动模范韩富拴亲手处理的两块试验地：用酒拌种的莜麦高三尺六寸，发病率平均为百分之九，用温汤浸种的高四尺二寸，没有一根病株；未经处理的发病率达百分之九十九。这一事实大大地教育了群众，打破了群众“浸种怕烫死”、怕“麦秆软”的顾虑，推动了这一工作的开展。
