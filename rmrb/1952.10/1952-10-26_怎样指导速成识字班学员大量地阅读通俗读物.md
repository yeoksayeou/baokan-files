How to Guide Students in Literacy Classes to Read Popular Readings Extensively
    Beijing East Suburb District Quick Literacy Campaign Committee Office

    After students in quick literacy classes intensively learn new characters and carefully read textbooks, they must extensively read popular readings in order to consolidate their learning results. At the same time, through reading, they can enrich their vocabulary, increase their knowledge, and understand the essentials of writing. The Beijing East Suburb District has gained considerable experience in this area while promoting the quick literacy method.

    Many students in the Beijing East Suburb District quick literacy method experimental class, after extensively reading popular readings, have gradually improved from being able to write articles of only one or two hundred characters to being able to write seven or eight hundred characters, and writing with a central theme, clear layers, and vivid and specific content. The literacy level of students in the city's experimental class increased from an average of 1,800 characters to 2,300 characters, with the highest recognizing 2,900 characters. Spelling errors have also been greatly reduced. At the same time, due to the wide range of reading, the political awareness of the students has also been improved. For example, after reading "A Short Biography of Liu Hulan," many students decided to use her spirit of perseverance to learn culture. After Liu Xiurong read about the deeds of labor model Li Shunda, she organized a mutual aid group. Wang Xiuzhen, who used to be indifferent to politics, became an activist in the patriotic health movement.

    However, some teachers believe that it is enough to teach the textbook well and do not attach importance to letting students read popular readings extensively. As a result, although students can read the textbook "whizzingly," when they pick up other books and newspapers, they often stare blankly at the words, unable to read them into sentences. Their writing also lacks fresh vocabulary and ideas.

    When to Start Reading Popular Readings Extensively

    Extensive reading of popular readings should be carried out after students can fluently read the textbook, have basically consolidated about 2,000 commonly used characters, and have understood the general words, phrases, and sentences. When the textbook has not yet been thoroughly read, students generally do not want to read other books. They say, "I don't have time to read it, I still have to study (referring to the textbook)!" Because they cannot yet skillfully use new characters, they will encounter many "roadblocks" (new characters) when reading. If they only go back and forth on the textbook and do not switch to reading popular readings in a timely manner, students will also become bored and lax. Some students once said to the teachers, "The book has been read thoroughly, when will there be something new to come back!"

    Extensive reading of popular readings is carried out in conjunction with intensive reading of textbooks and writing activities. Therefore, reading materials should preferably be coordinated with the textbook and used as supplementary teaching materials. For example, when the text talks about "Tian Guiying," read "Women Drive Trains"; when it talks about "Snowy Mountains and Grasslands," read "The 25,000-Li Long March"; when it talks about "Writing Articles Should Have a Central Theme," read articles with a particularly prominent central theme. In this way, reading popular readings can be guided through explanation, and at the same time, through reading, students can further understand the content of the textbook and know how to better conduct writing.

    Ideological Mobilization Should Be Carried Out at Any Time

    Students generally believe that learning means learning the textbook well and writing well, and that reading "extra books" is not "effective." Therefore, teachers must fully explain the importance of extensively reading popular readings for consolidating learning results. Use concrete examples for publicity. For example, student Zhao Fengqin read a book describing the suffering and liberation of women and wrote an autobiography that was very vivid. The teacher asked her to introduce her experience in improving her writing ability through reading to everyone. Wu Yuqing said after reading "How Did Gao Yubao Learn Culture and Writing?": "It's better to read more books, otherwise you can't write well."

    During reading, students always hope to read every word without missing any. When they encounter a few new characters, they say they can't do it. Teachers should explain that when reading, it is necessary to understand the general meaning of the content, and not to shrink back when encountering one or two new characters.

    General students like books with pictures. Therefore, teachers should choose books according to the students' preferences and appropriately introduce the content of the book to arouse their interest and gradually develop their activities of extensively reading popular readings.

    Reading Must Be Carried Out in an Organized and Leadership Manner

    Reading popular readings must be carried out under the leadership of teachers, purposefully, plannedly, and organizedly. First of all, teachers must select appropriate materials according to the students' requirements and their actual cultural level. In the initial reading, students like to read children's books with many pictures, large characters, wide lines, easy to read aloud, and beautiful covers, such as "Chicken Feather Letter" and "Jinbao's Mother." Later, they asked for small series with illustrations, such as "Worker-Peasant Books," "Kong Shi's Father," and "Li Fenglian" published by Xinhua Bookstore. Further on, they asked to read longer literary novels or Zhao Shuli's "Registration" and Ma Feng's "Marriage." Secondly, when selecting readings, attention must also be paid to the specific target readers, because they have different requirements. For example, workers like to read model stories of Ma Hengchang and Zhao Zhankui. Farmers like to read the story of Li Shunda and the story of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant uprising. Women like to read novels about marriage issues such as "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" and model stories of Zhao Guilan, Liang Jun, and others. Young people like to read "The 25,000-Li Long March," stories of combat heroes, and books about the Communist Youth League. As for the small series of Resist America and Aid Korea and articles about the quick literacy method, everyone loves to read them. They say, "We understand what we are familiar with at a glance. If there are unfamiliar words, we can 'charge' through them and read them down. The more we read, the more interesting it becomes."

    When reading, clear requirements must be put forward. For different students, different requirements must be put forward according to different books. And put forward reading focus, so that students gradually master reading methods and constantly improve reading ability. Students generally read aloud at the beginning, then silent reading should be proposed, and then further requirements should be made to only look with their eyes, in order to increase reading speed.

    Strengthening the leadership of the group and giving play to the role of mutual assistance is also necessary. In this way, new characters, new words, and difficult sentences can generally be solved within the group; in terms of content, after mutual enlightenment, the understanding is deeper. It is also convenient for teachers to guide. Some teachers do not pay attention to giving play to the role of mutual assistance in the group, running around in the classroom, busy answering students' questions, which often leads to passivity and being overwhelmed. However, it is also necessary to prevent the one-sided emphasis on mutual assistance and the formation of egalitarianism, so as not to limit the improvement of top students.

    At the same time, teachers must regularly check the reading effect and summarize achievements and experiences, so as to put forward new tasks in a timely manner and promote the progress of reading.

    怎样指导速成识字班学员大量地阅读通俗读物
    北京东郊区速成识字运动委员会办公室
    速成识字班学员在突击生字、细读课本以后，必须大量阅读通俗读物，才能巩固学习成果。同时在阅读中使他们丰富词汇，增加知识，懂得写作的要领。北京东郊区在推行速成识字法工作中，在这方面取得了不少的经验。
    北京东郊区速成识字法实验班的许多学员经过大量阅读通俗读物，由只能写一、二百字的文章，逐步提高到能写七、八百字，而且写得有中心、层次分明，内容也生动具体。市民实验班学员的识字量，由原来平均识一千八百字增加到二千三百字，最高的认到二千九百字。错别字也大大减少了。同时由于阅读范围的广泛，学员的政治认识也提高了。如许多学员读过“刘胡兰小传”后，都决定拿她那种坚毅不屈的精神来学文化。刘秀荣看过关于劳动模范李顺达的事迹后，组织了互助组。王秀珍由一向不问政治的人变为爱国卫生运动中的积极分子。
    但也有一部分教师认为只要把课本教好就行了，不重视让学员大量阅读通俗读物。结果学员虽然能照着课本“哗哗”地念，但拿起其他的书报来，却往往对字发愣，读不成句，写话时也缺乏新鲜语汇和思想内容。
    什么时候开始大量阅读通俗读物
    大量阅读通俗读物应在学员能够流利地阅读课本，基本上巩固地占有了二千左右常用字，弄通了一般的字、词、语、句以后进行。在课本还没有读熟时，学员一般地不愿读其他的书，他们说：“哪顾得上看它呀，还得念书（指课本）呢！”因为他们还不能熟练地运用生字，阅读时会遇到很多“拦路虎”（生字）。如果只在课本上来回转，不适时地转入阅读通俗读物，学员也会因此而厌烦松懈起来。有些学员曾对教员说：“书都念得烂熟了，什么时候有新的什么时候再来吧！”
    大量阅读通俗读物是与精读课本和写话等活动相辅进行的。因此阅读材料最好要配合课本，把它作为补充教材，如课文讲“田桂英”，就阅读“女人开火车”；讲“雪山草地”，就读“二万五千里长征”；讲“写文章要有中心”，就阅读中心特别突出的文章。这样就可以通过讲解，指导阅读通俗读物，同时，通过阅读又能使学员进一步领会课本的内容，知道如何更好地进行写话。
    要随时进行思想动员
    学员们一般地都认为学习就是学好课本、写好字，“闲书”看不看“不吃劲”。所以教师必须充分说明大量阅读通俗读物对于巩固学习成果的重要性。用具体事例进行宣传，如学员赵凤琴看了描写妇女受苦和解放的书，写了一篇自传，内容很生动，教师就请她向大家介绍通过阅读提高写作能力的经验。吴玉清读过“高玉宝是怎样学习文化和学习写作的？”以后说：“还是多看点书吧，不然怎么也写不好。”
    阅读中，学员总希望一字不漏地读下来，碰到几个生字就说自己不行。教师应说明阅读时要了解内容大意，不要碰到了一两个生字就畏缩不前。
    一般学员爱好有图的书。因此，教师应根据学员的喜好来选择书籍，并适当介绍该书的内容，以引起他们的兴趣，使他们逐步展开大量阅读通俗读物的活动。
    必须有组织有领导地进行阅读
    阅读通俗读物必须在教师的领导下，有目的、有计划、有组织地进行。首先，教师必须根据学员的要求和他们的实际文化程度，选择适当的材料。初读时，学员喜欢看图多、字大、行间宽、念着顺嘴、封面漂亮的小儿书如“鸡毛信”、“金宝娘”等。随后他们就要求有插图的小丛书，如新华书店出版的“工农的书”、“孔十爹”、“李凤莲”等。再往后他们就要求看比较长的文艺小说或赵树理的“登记”、马烽的“结婚”等。其次，在选择读物时，还必须注意到具体的读者对象，因为他们有着不同的要求。如工人喜欢看马恒昌、赵占魁等的模范故事。农民喜欢看李顺达的故事及太平天国农民起义等故事。妇女爱看“小二黑结婚”等有关婚姻问题的小说和赵桂兰、梁军等的模范故事。青年喜欢看“二万五千里长征”、战斗英雄故事及有关青年团的书。至于抗美援朝的小丛书和有关速成识字法的文章，人人都爱读，他们说：“我们熟悉的事一看就懂，有不认识的字，一‘冲’就读下来了，越看越有意思。”
    进行阅读时，要提出明确的要求。对不同的学员，必须根据不同的书籍，提出不同的要求。并提出阅读重点，使学员逐步地掌握阅读方法，不断地提高阅读能力。学员初读时一般是朗读，随后就应提出默读，再后就进一步要求只用眼看，以增进阅读速度。
    加强小组的领导，发挥互助的作用也是必要的。这样，生字、生词和难句一般都可以在小组内解决；内容方面，经过互相启发，领会得比较深刻些。教师指导起来也方便。有的教师不注意发挥小组的互助作用，在课堂上东跑西走，忙于回答学员的问题，这样就往往陷于被动，招架不开。但是也必须防止片面强调互助、形成平均主义的偏向，以免限制优等生的提高。
    同时教师必须定期检查阅读效果，总结成绩和经验，这样才能及时提出新的任务，推动阅读的进展。
