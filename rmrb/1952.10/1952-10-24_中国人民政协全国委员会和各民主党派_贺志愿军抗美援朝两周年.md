Xinhua News Agency, October 24th:

    The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and various democratic parties sent a telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, congratulating them on the second anniversary of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. The telegram is as follows:

    To Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and all commanders, fighters, political workers, logistics personnel, and transportation personnel comrades!

    On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's departure to fight abroad, we extend our warm congratulations and high respect to you on behalf of the people of the whole country.

    In the past two years, you have fought bravely alongside the Korean People's Army and achieved a great victory. This great victory has defended the independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, protected China's security, and enabled the smooth progress of our great motherland's construction and reform work. At the same time, it has also safeguarded peace in the Far East and the world, encouraged all peace-loving people in the world, and enhanced their courage and confidence in opposing wars of aggression and defending world peace.

    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is now regarded by the people of the whole country as "the most beloved people," and all peace-loving people in the world also regard you as the vanguard of defending world peace and cheer for your victory.

    It is precisely because of their serious failure that the U.S. aggressors were forced to sit down for armistice negotiations. However, the U.S. aggressors lacked sincerity in the armistice negotiations. During the long negotiation process of one year and three months, they used various despicable and shameless means to delay and sabotage the armistice negotiations, and continuously and massively murdered prisoners of war from the Korean and Chinese side. Only through the patient efforts of the Korean and Chinese side was most of the agenda of the armistice negotiations agreed upon. If it were not for the U.S. aggressors continuing to insist on their absurd proposition of forcibly detaining prisoners of war from the Korean and Chinese side on the only remaining issue of repatriation, the Korean armistice could have been achieved earlier. Recently, the U.S. aggressors have intensified their actions to sabotage the armistice negotiations, openly refusing to discuss the new repatriation proposal from the Korean and Chinese side, unilaterally announcing an indefinite adjournment, thus interrupting the Korean armistice negotiations. The purpose of the U.S. aggressors is to use this to put pressure on other countries in the United Nations General Assembly, forcing them to agree to the U.S. plot to sabotage the negotiations and expand the war. This shameless action of the U.S. aggressors clearly exposes their malicious intention to reject peace and persist in the war of aggression.

    However, the conspiracy of the U.S. aggressors is bound to fail. The unreasonable threats of the U.S. aggressors will absolutely not intimidate the Korean and Chinese people. We will continue to engage in a resolute struggle to completely smash the U.S. aggressors' plot to sabotage the armistice negotiations and expand the war, strive to achieve a Korean armistice on a fair and reasonable basis, and then peacefully resolve the Korean issue. The development of the Korean war situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable to the enemy, and the Korean and Chinese people's forces are becoming stronger and stronger in battle. If the enemy dares to expand the war and rashly invade, they will inevitably encounter relentless blows from the Korean and Chinese people's forces. We believe that under the heroic struggle of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, with the strong support of the people of Korea and China, and with the sympathy and support of all peace-loving people in the world, our just struggle against aggression and for the defense of peace will surely achieve final victory.

    In order to support your heroic battles on the front lines, the people of the whole country have carried out many great tasks in the past two years. In the future, we will continue to strengthen the work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, vigorously carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, so as to use greater strength to support you, and strive for the victorious end of the Korean War and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea!

    Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

### 中国人民政协全国委员会和各民主党派  贺志愿军抗美援朝两周年

    中国人民政协全国委员会和各民主党派
    贺志愿军抗美援朝两周年
    【新华社二十四日讯】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会和各民主党派致电中国人民志愿军，祝贺抗美援朝两周年。电文如下：中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员暨全体指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员、后勤工作人员、运输工作人员同志们！
    值此中国人民志愿军出国作战两周年纪念日，我们谨代表全国人民向你们致以热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意。
    两年来，你们和朝鲜人民军并肩英勇作战，取得了伟大的胜利。这一伟大的胜利，保卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立，保卫了中国的安全，使我们伟大祖国的建设与改革工作得以顺利进行。同时，也保卫了远东及世界的和平，鼓舞了全世界一切爱好和平的人民，增强了他们反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平的勇气和信心。
    中国人民志愿军现在已被全国人民看作是“最可爱的人”，全世界一切爱好和平的人民也把你们看作是保卫世界和平的先锋，并为你们的胜利而欢呼。
    美国侵略者正是由于自己的严重失败，才被迫坐下来进行停战谈判。但美国侵略者对停战谈判是极端缺乏诚意的，在一年零三个多月的长时间的谈判过程中，它曾使用了各种卑鄙无耻的手段来拖延和破坏停战谈判，并连续不断地大批杀害朝中方面的被俘人员。只是由于朝中方面耐心的努力，才使停战谈判的大部分议程获得了协议。如果不是美国侵略者在剩下的唯一的遣俘问题上继续坚持其强迫扣留朝中方面被俘人员的荒谬主张，朝鲜停战已可早日实现。最近美国侵略者破坏停战谈判的行动更变本加厉，公然拒绝讨论朝中方面的遣俘新建议，片面宣布无限期休会，因而中断了朝鲜停战谈判。美国侵略者的目的，是想借此在联合国大会上对其他国家施用压力，迫使他们同意美方破坏谈判和扩大战争的阴谋。美国侵略者的这一无耻行动，清楚地暴露了它拒绝和平、坚持侵略战争的恶毒用心。
    但是美国侵略者的阴谋是必然要失败的。美国侵略者的无理威胁绝对吓不倒朝中人民。我们将为彻底粉碎美国侵略者破坏停战谈判、扩大战争的阴谋，争取在公平合理的基础上实现朝鲜停战，并进而和平解决朝鲜问题，继续从事坚决的斗争。朝鲜战局的发展已愈来愈对敌人不利，朝中人民部队已愈战愈强。敌人如敢扩大战争，贸然进犯，必然会遇到朝中人民部队无情的打击。我们相信，在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的英勇奋斗下，在朝中两国人民的大力支援下，在全世界一切爱好和平的人民的同情与支持下，我们为反对侵略和保卫和平而作的正义斗争，一定可以得到最后的胜利。
    全国人民为了支持你们在前方的英勇战斗，在过去两年中已进行了许多巨大的工作。今后我们将继续加强抗美援朝工作，努力开展增产节约运动，好用更大的力量来支持你们，为争取朝鲜战争的胜利结束和朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗。
    为抗美援朝而牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
