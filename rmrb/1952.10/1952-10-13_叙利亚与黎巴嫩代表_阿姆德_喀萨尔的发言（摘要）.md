Speech by Ahmed Kasar, Representative of Syria and Lebanon (Summary)

The people of Syria and Lebanon are working actively to defend peace, defend national independence, and oppose war conspiracies. They have widely expressed their support for this historically significant Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The people of Syria and Lebanon value this conference because of their close relationship with the people of Asian countries, and because this conference will make a great contribution to the peaceful resolution of the Japanese issue, the cessation of the Korean War, and the prohibition of bacteriological weapons.

The revival of militarism in Japan and West Germany threatens world peace. We from Syria and Lebanon know that only in a peaceful world, in a situation of international understanding, can we achieve national independence and realize a free life.

We are fighting against plans for war and colonialism, and against the Middle East Command. The people of the Middle East understand that the result of this plan will only be the destruction of their countries, the death of their children, and ultimately occupation and enslavement. Moreover, the Middle East Command is a supplementary part of the Atlantic Pact and a continuation of war preparations in Asia. The purpose of these preparations is to attack the Soviet Union, People's China, and the People's Democratic countries. Because we refuse to fight against these countries, we oppose the use of Syria and Lebanon as bases for aggression.

In Syria and Lebanon, work to support the conclusion of a five-power peace pact and oppose bacteriological warfare has been widely organized. Two farmers' conferences protested bacteriological warfare, demanded an end to the Korean War, and demanded the conclusion of a peace pact. The first farmers' conference was attended by 4,000 representatives, and the second farmers' conference represented 300 rural villages. A conference of 9,000 workers representing Syria and a conference of 7,000 workers representing Lebanon lodged protests against the establishment of the Middle East Command, demanding a cessation of the Korean War and the signing of a five-power peace pact. Three thousand students at Damascus University protested bacteriological warfare and resolutely demanded that science serve the happiness of mankind.

The people of Syria and Lebanon know that they are not isolated in their struggle for peace and national independence. They know that their brothers in the Asian and Pacific region are with them, and they know that the great Soviet Union and People's China are with them.

Inspired by this spirit, the people of Syria and Lebanon are enthusiastically preparing for the World People's Peace Congress. Because they deeply believe that this conference is not only for solving major international problems, but also for helping their countries avoid destruction and saving their women, children, and youth from death.

Dear Korean people, we stand with you against barbaric and vile bacteriological warfare and demand that foreign troops withdraw from your country.

Japanese brothers, we support you in achieving freedom for your country and liberating it from American occupation.

Vietnamese friends, I would like to say to you that your struggle for national independence inspires our sympathy.

The awakened Arab peoples are no longer sound asleep; only under the protection of peace, freedom, and national independence can they rest easy.

    叙利亚与黎巴嫩代表
    阿姆德·喀萨尔的发言（摘要）
    叙利亚和黎巴嫩的人民为了保卫和平，保卫民族独立，为了反对战争阴谋而积极的工作着。他们广泛地表示了他们对于这一次有历史意义的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的支持。叙利亚和黎巴嫩的人民之所以重视这一次的会议，是由于他们和亚洲各国人民的紧密关系，由于这次会议对于和平解决日本问题，制止朝鲜战争，禁止细菌武器，将有极大的贡献。
    日本与西德的军国主义的复活威胁着全世界的和平。我们来自叙利亚及黎巴嫩的人知道只有在和平的世界里，在国际间互相谅解的情况之下，我们才能够实现民族的独立，实现自由的生活。
    我们进行斗争，反对战争和殖民主义的计划，反对中东司令部。中东各国人民了解，这个计划的结果只会使他们的国家遭受破坏，使孩子死亡，最后就是占领和奴役。不仅如此，中东司令部是大西洋公约的一个补充部分，是亚洲战争准备的延续。这些准备工作的目的是进攻苏联、人民中国和人民民主国家的。因为我们拒绝对这些国家作战，所以我们反对利用叙利亚和黎巴嫩作侵略的基地。
    在叙利亚和黎巴嫩，赞助缔结五大国和平公约和反对细菌战的工作，曾经有了广泛的组织。有两个农民大会抗议细菌战，要求终止朝鲜战争，并要求缔结一个和平公约，第一个农民大会的出席代表有四千人，第二个农民大会代表三百个农村。叙利亚代表九千工人的大会和黎巴嫩代表七千工人的大会提出反对设立中东司令部的抗议，要求停止朝鲜战争并签订五大国和平公约。大马士革大学三千学生抗议细菌战，坚决要求科学为人类的幸福服务。
    叙利亚和黎巴嫩人民知道在争取和平和民族独立的斗争中，他们不是孤立无援的，他们知道你们亚洲及太平洋区域的兄弟们和他们在一起，他们知道伟大的苏联与人民中国和他们在一起。
    在这种精神感召之下，叙利亚和黎巴嫩人民踊跃地进行世界人民和平大会的准备工作。因为他们深切相信，这个会议不仅是为了解决国际间的大问题，而且是帮助他们的国家免于破坏，使他们的妇女、儿童、青年，免于死亡。
    亲爱的朝鲜人民，我们和你们站在一起，反对野蛮的和丑恶的细菌战，要求外国军队撤出你们的国家。
    日本兄弟们，我们支援你们，使你们的国家获得自由，从美国的占领中解放出来。
    越南的朋友们，我愿意同你们说，你们为祖国独立而从事的斗争激发了我们的同情。
    觉醒过来的阿拉伯各族人民不再酣睡了，只有在和平自由与民族独立的庇护下，他们才能高枕无忧。                  （新华社）
