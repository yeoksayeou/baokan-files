    Shandong University's Administrative Departments Carry Out Recreational and Sports Activities

    To the Editor: After the "Three-Anti" Movement, the vast majority of staff in the administrative departments of Shandong University not only displayed a new spirit in their work but also changed their past neglect of sports and recreational activities. We organized sports activities, which improved everyone's health and work efficiency. Now, comrades living on campus do broadcast exercises every morning. Although everyone lives quite scattered, they all automatically participate on time. Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, we set aside ten minutes to practice singing and have already learned six or seven songs. To encourage everyone to participate in sports activities, we also held basketball competitions. A comrade from the General Affairs Section said, "Before participating in sports and recreational activities, I would either squat in the office or go back to the dormitory to lie in bed and read, with very little activity. Even climbing stairs felt sluggish. After exercising, I feel much more energetic at work than before."

    The good progress and persistence of our school's sports and recreational activities are inseparable from the leadership and call of the Party and Youth League branches. The Youth League branch assigned a dedicated person to lead this work and conducted individual mobilization for comrades who had consistently disliked activities.

    山东大学校部行政部门开展了文娱体育活动
    编辑同志：“三反”运动以后，我们山东大学校部行政部门的绝大部分工作人员，不但在工作上出现了新的气象，同时改变了过去不重视体育文娱活动的情况。我们组织了体育活动，增进了大家的健康和工作效率。现在住在校内的同志每天早上都进行广播体操，虽然大家住得比较分散，但都自动按时参加。每星期二、四、六，抽出十几分钟的时间练习唱歌，已经唱会了六、七支歌子。为了鼓励大家参加体育活动，还举办了篮球比赛。总务科的一位同志说：“没有参加体育文娱活动以前，我每天不是蹲在办公室里，就是回宿舍躺在床上看看书，很少活动，连上楼梯都是懒洋洋的。经过锻炼以后，工作起来比过去精神饱满多了。”
    我们学校的体育文娱活动能够很好的展开，并能坚持下来，是与党、团支部的领导、号召分不开的。团支部派专人负责领导这一工作，并对一贯不爱活动的同志进行了个别动员。
