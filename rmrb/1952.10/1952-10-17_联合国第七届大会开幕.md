Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th Dispatch: The Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly opened in New York on the morning of October 14th.

The session was opened by the outgoing President of the Sixth General Assembly, Mr. Nájera (representative of Mexico).

Following this, welcoming speeches were given by the Mayor of New York City, Impellitteri, the US representative, Austin, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and Nájera.

Then, Nájera appointed a Credentials Committee composed of representatives from Belgium, Burma, Lebanon, New Zealand, Panama, Paraguay, Sweden, the Soviet Union, and the United States.

Subsequently, the General Assembly elected the President of the current session. Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson was elected as President with fifty-one votes. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries supported the Indian representative who had been nominated as a candidate for President during the voting.

At the meeting, the chairmen of the various working committees of the General Assembly were elected. Brazilian representative Muñoz was elected Chairman of the First (Political and Security) Committee; Greek representative Kyrou was elected Chairman of the Special Political Committee; Czechoslovak representative Nosek was elected Chairman of the Second (Economic and Financial) Committee; Pakistani representative Ali was elected Chairman of the Third (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) Committee; Argentinian representative Muñoz was elected Chairman of the Fourth (Trusteeship) Committee; Philippine representative Romulo was elected Chairman of the Fifth (Administrative and Budgetary) Committee; Thai representative Wan Waithayakon was elected Chairman of the Sixth (Legal) Committee.

At the meeting, the President of the General Assembly, Pearson, rudely violated procedural rules by announcing the inclusion of the Greek representative, Chairman of the Special Political Committee, into the General Committee, granting him the right to vote. Soviet representative Gromyko spoke out, pointing out that the President had seriously violated the procedures and rules of the General Assembly's work during the first meeting and demanded the cancellation of the President's illegal decision. As a result, the President had to put the request to rescind his decision to a verbal vote. Consequently, twenty-five delegations voted in favor of rescinding the President's illegal decision, and eight delegations abstained. The US-British bloc only mustered twenty-seven votes in favor of the President's decision.

Before the adjournment of the meeting, the representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Honduras, and Egypt were elected as Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly. The US-British bloc also used trickery to elect Kuomintang elements as Vice-Presidents.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 14th Dispatch: According to TASS, the Soviet delegation headed by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic delegation headed by Baranovksy, and the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic delegation headed by Kiselev arrived in New York on the 13th aboard the "Queen Elizabeth" to attend the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, scheduled to open on the 14th. Those who went to the pier to welcome them included: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Permanent Representative to the Security Council Zorin, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Malik, and Soviet Ambassador to the United States Zarubin.

    联合国第七届大会开幕
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国第七届大会于十月十四日上午在纽约开幕。
    大会由任期届满的第六届大会主席纳孚（墨西哥代表）揭幕。
    接着，由纽约市市长殷柏利特里、美国代表奥斯汀、联合国秘书长和纳孚等致欢迎词。
    然后，纳孚指定由比利时、缅甸、黎巴嫩、新西兰、巴拿马、巴拉圭、瑞典、苏联、美国代表组成全权证书委员会。
    随后，大会选举本届大会主席。加拿大外交部长皮尔逊以五十一票当选为主席。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等国代表在投票中支持曾被提名为主席候选人的印度代表。
    在会议上选出了大会各工作委员会的主席。巴西代表慕尼兹当选为第一（政治与安全）委员会的主席；希腊代表基罗当选为特别政治委员会的主席；捷克斯洛伐克代表诺西克当选为第二（经济与财政）委员会的主席；巴基斯坦代表阿里当选为第三（社会、人道与文化）委员会的主席；阿根廷代表门诺斯当选为第四（托管）委员会的主席；菲律宾代表罗慕洛当选为第五（行政与预算）委员会的主席；泰国代表威他耶功当选为第六（法律）委员会的主席。
    在会上，大会主席皮尔逊粗暴地破坏程序规则，宣布把特别政治委员会主席希腊代表包括进总务委员会，并给他投票权。苏联代表葛罗米柯发言指出，主席在第一次会议上就严重地破坏了大会工作的程序和规则，并要求撤销主席的非法决定。这样，主席不得不把撤销他的决定的要求付诸口头表决。结果，二十五个代表团投票赞成撤销主席的非法决定，八个代表团弃权。美英集团只凑到二十七票赞成主席的决定。
    在会议休会以前，苏联、美国、英国、法国、洪都拉斯和埃及的代表被选为大会副主席。美英集团并使用诡计把国民党分子也选为副主席。
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社纽约十四日讯：以苏联外交部长维辛斯基为首的苏联代表团、以巴拉诺夫斯基为首的乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国代表团、以基塞列夫为首的白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国代表团已于十三日乘“伊利萨伯女王号”船到达纽约，出席定于十四日开幕的联合国第七届大会。前往码头欢迎的有：苏联外交部副部长、驻安全理事会常任代表佐林、苏联外交部副部长马立克及苏联驻美国大使查鲁宾。
