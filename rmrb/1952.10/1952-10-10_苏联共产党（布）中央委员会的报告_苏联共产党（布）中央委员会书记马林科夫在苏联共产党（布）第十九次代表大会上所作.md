The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Report
— Speech by Georgi Malenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)

Comrades, the period since the 18th Party Congress has been filled with events of worldwide historical significance.

The Second World War fundamentally shook the lives of many nations and states, changing the face of the world. Under the direction of the international imperialist reactionaries, militaristic Japan in the East and Hitlerite Germany in the West launched wars, but these wars shattered the plans of the war instigators and, due to the heroic struggle of the Soviet people, ended with results that the imperialists had not anticipated.

The result was not the destruction or weakening of the Soviet Union, but its strengthening and enhanced international prestige. The result was not the weakening or destruction of democratic systems, but the separation of several countries in Central and Southeastern Europe from the capitalist system and the establishment of people's democratic systems in those countries. The result was not the further enslavement of the peoples of the colonies and dependent countries, but a new and powerful surge in their national liberation struggles, and the sharpening of the crisis in the imperialist colonial system. The great victory of the Chinese people was a serious blow to the entire global imperialist system. Today, one-third of humanity has freed itself from imperialist oppression and been liberated from the chains of imperialist exploitation.

In the capitalist world itself, the war eliminated three major powers—Germany, Japan, and Italy—from the list of great powers, while France and Britain lost their former positions.

The post-war period is a time of further weakening of the world capitalist system and the growing strength of democratic and socialist forces.

In the economic sphere, in the post-war years, capitalist countries have faced new economic difficulties, and American imperialism has attempted to expand externally, leading to a sharpening of contradictions among capitalist countries. Due to the attempts of the imperialist bloc to escape economic difficulties through economic militarization and preparation for new wars, these contradictions have intensified.

In the political sphere, the post-war period has seen the formation of two camps—the aggressive, anti-democratic camp led by the United States, and the peace-loving, democratic camp. During this period, a new center of reaction and aggression has emerged in the capitalist world, embodied in the United States. The main threat to peace, freedom, and the national independence of countries comes from there. In the face of this crisis, the peace-loving forces of the world have risen to fight resolutely to defend peace and national independence.

In this post-war period, the Soviet Union has continued to advance along the path indicated by the 18th Party Congress—peaceful development and gradual transition from socialism to communism, a path interrupted by the war. In the post-war years, there have been great achievements in industry, transportation, agriculture, and in science, culture, and the arts. The Soviet system has been further consolidated, and the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society and the friendship among the peoples of our country have been strengthened. Throughout these years, the Soviet Union has been actively fighting to maintain and strengthen world peace.

Let us examine the main issues of the international situation.

1. The Further Weakening of the World Capitalist System and the Economic Conditions of Capitalist Countries

Currently, the global economic situation has two development paths. One path is the continuous peaceful economic development of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, an economy that does not face crises and aims to meet the material and cultural needs of society to the maximum extent. This economy ensures a gradual improvement in the living standards of the masses and full employment. The characteristic of this economy is friendly economic cooperation among the countries of the democratic camp.

The other path is the stagnant capitalist economy. This economy is mired in an ever-deepening capitalist general crisis and recurrent economic crises. This is the path of economic militarization and the one-sided development of the military production sector; this is the path of competition among many countries and the subjugation of some countries by others. This situation arises because the goal of this economy is not to increase social welfare but to exploit the majority of the people in one's own country, leading to their bankruptcy and poverty, and to exploit and plunder the peoples of other countries, especially those of backward countries, through constant plunder, and finally through war and the militarization of the national economy, to secure the maximum profits for capitalists.

The production development of the Soviet Union and capitalist countries can be illustrated with the following figures:

Industrial Production of the Soviet Union and Various Capitalist Countries from 1929 to 1951 (1929 = 100)

| Year       | Soviet Union | USA | UK  | France | Italy |
|------------|--------------|-----|-----|--------|-------|
| 1929       | 100          | 100 | 100 | 100    | 100   |
| 1939       | 552          | 99  | 123 | 80     | 108   |
| 1943       | 573          | 217 | -   | -      | -     |
| 1946       | 466          | 155 | 112 | 63     | 72    |
| 1947       | 571          | 170 | 121 | 74     | 93    |
| 1948       | 721          | 175 | 135 | 85     | 97    |
| 1949       | 870          | 160 | 144 | 92     | 103   |
| 1950       | 1082         | 182 | 157 | 92     | 118   |
| 1951       | 1266         | 200 | 160 | 104    | 134   |

From this table, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's industrial production in 1951 was 1266% of the 1929 level, nearly 13 times higher. The Soviet Union's industry, as in the pre-war period, has been continuously developing on the basis of peaceful production. From this table, it can also be seen that U.S. industrial production stagnated from 1929 to 1939, and only began to increase due to the surge in military production during the Second World War; it then declined sharply, only rising again after the U.S. launched the war in Korea and accelerated military expansion, reaching twice the 1929 level in 1951. In the same period, Britain's industrial production increased by only 60%, while in other Western European capitalist countries, industrial production remained stagnant at the 1929 level.

In the people's democratic countries of Europe, although they suffered greater damage from the war than the Western European capitalist countries, their industrial production had already surpassed the pre-war level by 1951: Poland increased by 2.9 times, Czechoslovakia by 1.7 times, Hungary by 2.5 times, Romania by 1.9 times, Bulgaria by 4.6 times, and Albania by more than 5 times. Agriculture in these countries is also steadily rising, particularly the production of technical crops, which has increased significantly; there have also been considerable achievements in livestock farming. The German Democratic Republic has made great strides in economic development. By 1952, the republic's industrial production had not only recovered but exceeded the pre-war level by 36%; industrial production in 1951 was 2.4 times that of 1946; metallurgy, machine manufacturing, chemical industry, and power industry have been developing year by year. In agriculture, the sown area and yield have exceeded the pre-war level.

The economy of the People's Republic of China is developing rapidly. The Chinese people are working with great enthusiasm and are successfully overcoming the serious consequences left by years of war against Japanese aggression and the reactionary Kuomintang. Since the establishment of the people's democratic government, China's industry has been developing at a rapid pace: industrial production in 1951 was more than twice that of 1949; railway transportation has been restored, and the construction of new railway lines is accelerating. The great land reform carried out by the Chinese people's government has achieved great results in agriculture: grain production in 1951 reached 128% of the 1949 level, and cotton production reached 252% of the 1949 level. The national finances of old China were in complete chaos, with hyperinflation reaching extreme levels, while the Chinese people's government has stabilized the national finances and ensured currency stability.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, liberated from Japanese colonial rule, has made great strides in the economy. In 1949, its industrial production was already four times that of 1946. In the countryside, after the people's democratic government implemented land reform, the sown area increased by nearly 25%, and the yield per unit area of all crops increased significantly. The aggressive attack by American imperialism interrupted the peaceful construction work of the Korean people. Under the banner of the United Nations, American and other countries' troops are savagely destroying the peaceful cities and villages of North Korea, destroying its industry and agriculture.

The Mongolian People's Republic has made great achievements in developing its economy. Its national economy is growing and consolidating year by year, the material well-being of the Mongolian people is increasing, and their culture is developing. The main economic sector of this country—livestock farming—is developing rapidly. Since the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic, the number of livestock has increased to 2.5 times, and all livestock are now owned by working farmers. The production of state-owned and cooperative industries has nearly tripled in the past ten years.

All statistical data on the production development of capitalist countries and democratic camp countries show that in terms of development speed, the industrial production of capitalist countries, including the United States, lags far behind the industrial development of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries.

Furthermore, from these statistical data, it can be seen that the slight increase in industrial production in capitalist countries is entirely the result of war preparations and wartime supply for the war.

The Second World War did not eliminate the economic and political contradictions of capitalism but instead sharpened them, shaking the economies of capitalist countries and deepening the general crisis of the world capitalist system. The Second World War did not fulfill the wishes of the big bourgeoisie of the imperialist countries. During the war, the two capitalist blocs that fought each other each intended to use force to redraw the world map, to seize new sources of raw materials, and to expand their markets for goods, that is, to sacrifice their enemies to consolidate their own economic positions and achieve world hegemony.

However, these plans failed. Although Germany and Japan, as the main competitors of the three major capitalist countries—America, Britain, and France—were defeated, the hopes of these three countries, especially the United States, to increase their industrial production by four or five times were dashed. Moreover, China and the people's democratic countries of Europe have left the capitalist system and, together with the Soviet Union, formed a united and powerful peace-loving democratic camp opposed to the imperialist camp.

The economic consequences of the formation of these two opposing camps, as Comrade Stalin pointed out, are the disintegration of the unified, all-encompassing world market and the emergence of two parallel world markets—the market of the peace-loving democratic camp countries and the market of the imperialist aggressive camp. The disintegration of the unified world market is the most important economic result of the Second World War and its economic impact.

These two world markets are developing in opposite directions. The new democratic world market does not face sales difficulties because it adapts to the crisis-free development of production in the democratic camp, and its capacity increases year by year because the continuous increase in production in all countries of the democratic camp expands the capacity of the democratic market. On the other hand, there is another world market, the imperialist market, which has no connection with the Soviet Union and other democratic countries and is therefore shrinking and facing sales difficulties due to stagnation and crises in production, mass unemployment and poverty, and the severance of ties with democratic countries. Moreover, it should be noted that due to the disintegration of the unified world market, the scope of world resources that the major capitalist countries—America, Britain, and France—can obtain has suddenly shrunk. As a result, the capitalist world market is shrinking, and the conditions for selling goods in this market are worsening and will continue to worsen.

The Second World War had different results for different capitalist countries, greatly changing their economic relations. Among the countries that participated in this war, many countries' economies were severely damaged due to long-term war and the loss of manpower and resources. This is especially true for Germany, Italy, and Japan. France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and several other countries also suffered significant losses. Britain was also severely weakened.

America profited from the war, and American billionaires consolidated their economic positions. However, America did not achieve its goals; it did not establish American capital's hegemony in the world market. America had hoped to increase its production by four or five times after Germany and Japan were defeated. However, it took great effort to only double its production, and now it is gradually falling into an economic crisis. This is a fact: at least three million people in America are completely unemployed, and the number of semi-unemployed is even greater. The mass strikes of workers are causing American billionaires more headaches. The reason for all this is that American industry has lost markets like the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries in Europe, and this can only be blamed on the American ruling class.

American imperialism is not only the international exploiter and oppressor of the peoples of other countries but also a force that is destroying the economies of the remaining capitalist countries. Taking advantage of the decline of its competitors, American monopolies seized a large part of the capitalist world market after the war. They are destroying the multi-faceted economic ties that have historically formed among capitalist countries and replacing them with one-sided ties between these countries and America. American monopolists are making the capitalist world market more chaotic; on the one hand, they are intensifying the dumping of their own goods, and on the other hand, they are not allowing foreign goods to enter their domestic market, resulting in American people suffering from high prices. American imperialism does not allow Western European countries to buy grain from their former Eastern European markets, while Western European countries have always exported large quantities of industrial goods to these markets in exchange for food and raw materials.

The economic policy of American imperialism cannot but sharpen the contradictions between America and other capitalist countries. The main contradiction among these contradictions is still between America and Britain, whose manifestation is the open struggle between American and British monopolists for sources of oil, rubber, non-ferrous metals, rare metals, sulfur, and wool, as well as markets for selling goods.

In addition, there are extremely serious contradictions between America and Japan, America and Italy, and America and West Germany—these countries are all under the occupation and slavery of American dictators. It would be naive to think that these defeated countries are willing to remain forever under the iron hoof of American occupiers. It would be foolish to think that they will not try to break free from American shackles and live independently.

Due to American capitalism's "aid" under the pretext of loans, it has infiltrated the economies of Britain, France, and Italy, seizing the raw materials and markets of British and French colonies. The contradictions between America and Britain, and America and France, are becoming increasingly sharp and will continue to sharpen. Britain and France, followed by other capitalist countries, are striving to break free from dependence on America to achieve an independent position and high profits. British capitalists are already engaged in a stubborn struggle against America's strict control over international trade.

The economic difficulties faced by capitalist countries after the war have become more severe due to the imperialists' own closure of the market of the democratic world. America has reduced its trade with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in Europe to almost zero and stopped trade with China. It has not only prohibited the defeated countries (Japan, West Germany, and Italy) from trading goods in the markets of the democratic camp countries but also prohibited Britain, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, and other capitalist countries from trading goods in the markets of the democratic camp countries. In 1951, the trade between America and the countries that now make up the democratic camp was only one-tenth of the 1937 figure; Britain's trade with these countries was reduced to one-sixth, and France's trade was less than one-fourth.

American, British, and French imperialists thought that by imposing an economic "blockade" on the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries of Europe, they could strangle these countries. But the actual effect was not strangulation but the strengthening of the new global democratic market. Thus, the imperialists themselves inflicted a heavy blow on their own exports and deepened the contradiction between their industrial production potential and the market for industrial products.

All of this means that more profound contradictions have arisen in the capitalist economy, and the entire world capitalist economic system is weaker and more unstable than before the war.

American capitalists are aware of these economic difficulties and are trying to overcome them through waging the Korean War, expanding military spending, and militarizing industry.

The American, British, and French imperialists launched a reactionary war against the Korean people, incited anti-democratic camp war hysteria, and then put their own economies on a war footing, carrying out large-scale economic militarization and military expansion. In these countries, an increasingly large part of industrial production is now used for military equipment. In the main industrial sectors of America and other capitalist countries, military orders play a decisive role. In the budgets of capitalist countries, the proportion of direct and indirect military spending is continuously increasing. America's direct military spending was $10 billion in the 1937-1938 fiscal year, increasing to $58.2 billion in the 1952-1953 fiscal year, now accounting for 74% of the American national budget, while in the 1937-1938 fiscal year, it was only 14%; in the same period, Britain's military spending increased from £107 million to £1,634 million, accounting for 34% of the total budget, while before the war, it was only 17%; France's military spending now accounts for nearly 40% of the total budget.

This unprecedented increase in military spending has led to continuous tax increases and large-scale currency issuance. The entire fiscal system of capitalist countries has been greatly weakened and continues to deteriorate due to the war and the policies of the American ruling class. Currency devaluation has reached unprecedented levels. According to official figures that are obviously underreported, the purchasing power of the dollar in 1951 was only 43% of its 1939 level, the pound in the same period fell to 32% of its original value, the French franc fell to 3.8%, and the Italian lira fell to less than 2%.

The shift to a war economy has allowed America and other capitalist countries to temporarily raise the level of industrial production. Bourgeois economists are trying to use this to prove that large-scale military orders can maintain a high level of "business activity" indefinitely. However, reality has refuted this arbitrary claim. In this year, the third year of intensified capitalist economic militarization, its serious consequences are becoming increasingly apparent. War and inflation have indeed created a temporary boom, but at the same time, they have given capitalist economic development a one-sided military character. More and more goods and raw materials are consumed in non-productive military consumption or turned into massive, non-circulating strategic reserves. At the same time, economic militarization forces them to use tax increases to squeeze money from the people. All of this turns the budgets of capitalist countries into tools for billionaires to plunder the people, greatly reducing the purchasing power of the people, lowering demand for industrial and agricultural products, sharply reducing the production of civilian goods, and creating conditions for a serious economic crisis.

The militarization of the national economy cannot eliminate the imbalance between production capacity and the shrinking purchasing power of the people; on the contrary, it makes this imbalance more severe. The ruling classes of capitalist countries are reducing the purchasing power of the people to the lowest limit, which continuously shrinks the capacity of the capitalist market. Therefore, the expansion of military production will inevitably lead to a new, larger economic crisis.

The military expansion movement is placing a particularly heavy burden on the economies of America's vassal states. After launching the Korean War, America increased pressure on Western European countries, demanding that they increasingly convert their industries to a war footing and allocate excessive funds for military preparedness, thereby depriving these countries of the materials and resources needed for civilian production. American imperialism has finally discarded the mask of "restorer" of the economies of capitalist countries. American "aid" is now only for military expansion and preparing for new wars. The military expansion movements carried out by the rulers of Britain, France, Italy, West Germany, Belgium, Norway, and other capitalist countries at the behest of American monopolists are destroying the economies of these countries and pushing them towards disaster.

Billionaires make bourgeois states subservient to themselves, directing them to implement policies of preparing for new wars and expanding military spending, thereby seizing huge profits. Military expansion has become the source of unprecedented enrichment for billionaires, especially American monopolists. Even according to the reduced official statistics, the profits of American monopolists increased from $3.3 billion in 1938 to $42.9 billion in 1951, an increase of 13 times. The big monopolists of Britain, as well as France, Italy, Japan, and other countries, have also made huge profits, although the economies of these countries are in a long-term state of stagnation. At the same time, militarization has greatly worsened the living conditions of the masses. The increase in taxes, the rise in prices of daily necessities, and inflation have accelerated the relative and absolute impoverishment of the working people. In America, even after deducting the nominal figures caused by currency devaluation, the direct taxes of residents in this fiscal year are still more than twelve times those of the 1937-1938 fiscal year. In Western European countries, the tax burden was already very heavy before the Second World War, and now taxes have increased again, doubling in Britain, increasing by 2.6 times in France, and increasing by 1.5 times in Italy.

Even according to the obviously reduced official indices of living expenses and retail prices, it is proven that prices are continuously rising, and the situation has become more serious since America launched its aggression against Korea. In such a situation, the policy of "freezing" wages implemented by capitalists with the support of right-wing socialists and reactionary trade union leaders has greatly reduced the real wages of workers and employees. In France and Italy, the real wages of workers in 1952 are less than half of the pre-war level, while in Britain, they have decreased by 20%. In America, according to statistics from the Electrical Workers Union, living expenses have almost tripled to the 1939 level. Despite the increasing war production, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed in capitalist countries continues to rise. In Italy and West Germany, the number of unemployed exceeds the level of the most severe years of the world economic crisis in 1929-1933; Italy has more than two million completely unemployed, and the number of semi-unemployed is even greater, while West Germany has nearly three million completely unemployed and semi-unemployed. In Japan, nearly ten million people are completely or semi-unemployed. In America, there are not less than three million completely unemployed and one million semi-unemployed. The number of unemployed in Britain is also increasing, with more than 500,000 unemployed there. Even in a small country like Belgium, there are more than 300,000 unemployed.

The continuous deterioration of the material conditions of broad strata of people due to military expansion has caused increasing dissatisfaction among the masses and strengthened their struggle against the policy of lowering living standards and preparing for new wars. The class contradictions between the imperialist bourgeoisie and the working class and all working people have sharply intensified, and the wave of strikes has swept across the entire capitalist world. Due to the new surge in wars and the national liberation struggles of colonies and dependent countries, the imperialist colonial system is disintegrating, making the situation of the world capitalist system today increasingly difficult.

As a direct result of the defeat of fascist Germany and militaristic Japan, the imperialist front has been breached in China, Korea, and Vietnam, and in these formerly colonial and semi-colonial areas, people's republics have risen. The victory of the Chinese people has further revolutionized the East and promoted the liberation struggles of the peoples of various countries oppressed by imperialism. In the post-war period, the contradictions between colonial countries and colonies have further increased. Britain, France, Belgium, and other colonial countries are trying to shift the heavy burden imposed on them by the economic militarization with the United States to the colonies.

At the same time, American imperialism continues to infiltrate the colonies and spheres of influence of these colonial countries, seizing positions in these regions and intensifying the exploitation of the peoples of colonies and dependent countries. In this struggle, American aggressors are plotting against their British and French "allies," thereby deepening the crisis of the imperialist colonial system through their own actions.

Many colonies and dependent countries (Egypt, Iran, Syria, Morocco, Tunisia, etc.) are being used as military bases, and their peoples are being prepared as "cannon fodder" for future wars.

Due to long-term imperialist oppression and the existence of feudal remnants, the economies of colonies and dependent countries, especially agriculture, are in a state of decline. In India, Indonesia, Iran, and African countries, tens of millions of people are constantly living in hunger, and large numbers of people are dying of starvation. The plundering exploitation of imperialist countries on colonies and dependent countries hinders the development of productive forces in these countries, keeping the purchasing power of their peoples at an extremely low level and shrinking the market for industrial goods. All of this, like a millstone, presses down on the economy of the capitalist world, deepening the internal contradictions of the entire world capitalist system.

The peoples of colonies and dependent countries are increasingly resolutely resisting imperialist oppressors. The struggles of the peoples of Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, the Philippines, and Indonesia, and the development of national resistance movements in India, Iran, Egypt, and other countries, prove that the scale of the national liberation movement is expanding.

2. The Sharpening of the International Situation. The Threat of New Wars by the American-British Aggressive Bloc. The Struggle of the Peoples of Various Countries for Peace

The activities of the American, British, and French ruling classes in international relations since the end of the Second World War have also been carried out under the banner of preparing for new wars.

After the end of the Second World War, America almost immediately abandoned the policy agreed upon by the wartime allies at the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences of the great powers. America, through a series of aggressive actions, has sharpened the international situation and placed the world in the shadow of a new war.

The rulers of America have been very frank in describing the purpose of their aggressive policy. As early as 1945, shortly after taking office as President of the United States, Truman declared: "Victory... has placed the long-term burden of world leadership on the American people." Later, Truman and other American politicians repeatedly boasted, "America will lead the world." This policy of attempting to rule the world and conquer all other countries is the basic spirit of the entire policy of the American imperialist ruling class.

Title: The American Imperialists are Preparing for a New War

The American leaders, of course, know full well that peaceful means cannot achieve the goal of dominating other countries. The Hitler gang also attempted to dominate other countries. The American leaders have learned from the experience of the Hitler gang: without the use of force, without launching new wars, it is unimaginable to dominate the world. Therefore, they have decided to disrupt peace and prepare for new wars. Since the Soviet Union is the main opponent of new wars and the main bastion of peace, the American leaders have drawn the conclusion that the spearhead of the war should be directed against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries.

Thus, the North Atlantic Aggression Pact, organized secretly behind the back of the Soviet Union, has taken shape. Moreover, to deceive the people and to conceal the aggressive purpose of this pact in front of the people, they claim that it is a "defense" pact against "Communism" and the Soviet Union, falsely asserting that the Soviet Union intends to attack the United States, Britain, France, and other countries in this pact.

For the same evil purpose, the United States has been continually establishing military bases in countries near the Soviet border.

For the same evil purpose, the American ruling class is arming West Germany and Japan.

In the process of arming West Germany and Japan, the American ruling class and its lackeys, under the watchful eyes of the world, are reviving these two hotbeds of the Second World War; to eliminate these hotbeds, the people of the world had shed a great deal of blood in that war.

The American attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea marks the transition of the American-British bloc from preparing for an aggressive war to direct aggression. The Korean people, fighting side by side with the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, are bravely defending the freedom and independence of their homeland, striking back at the peace-breakers; they have aroused the warm sympathy of all democratic and peace-loving people. (Thunderous applause)

Currently, there are many specific characteristics and features in the international situation, among which the following must be described in detail.

The main aggressor, the United States, is urgently forcing other capitalist countries, first and foremost the countries participating in the North Atlantic Pact, as well as the countries defeated in the Second World War—West Germany, Italy, and Japan—to march towards war. The American rulers issue orders, set war objectives, battlefields, and participating troops for the entire member countries of this bloc, and decide other related issues of war preparation.

The American rulers claim that what they aspire to is the establishment of an "ideal" such as the "League of Free Nations." They repeatedly declare that the United States, Britain, France, Turkey, and Greece represent this "League of Free Nations," while the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are supposedly "unfree" countries. In our view, the United States, Britain, France, Turkey, and other capitalist countries indeed have "freedom," but this is not the freedom of the people, but the freedom to exploit and plunder the people. As for the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, there is indeed no such freedom here, because in these countries, the freedom to exploit and plunder the working people has long been abolished. Look, what is it that the advocates of the "American way of life" boast about? (Applause)

In reality, the American policy towards its Western European and other capitalist "friends" is not a democratic policy, but an imperialist policy. Under the banner of "anti-Communism" and "defense of freedom," the Americans actually force those old capitalist countries and their colonies to be subordinate to the United States and plunder them. Like their predecessors, the Hitlerites, the American imperialists need the "anti-Communist" smokescreen to divert people's attention from their true aggressive designs.

In implementing its imperialist policy towards Britain, France, and other capitalist countries, the United States also shamelessly—speaking mildly—pretends to be the true friend of these countries. What a good friend! He rides on the backs of his little partners, plunders them, enslaves them, and beats them up, all the while saying, "Let's be friends." In the mouth of the American bigwig, this means: you carry me first, then I'll ride you. (Laughter)

Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Norway, these once-free capitalist countries, have actually abandoned their own policies and are now executing the policies dictated by the American imperialists, handing over their territories to the United States as bases and military jumping-off points, thereby exposing their own countries to attacks in the event of a war. To curry favor with the United States, they have concluded alliances and treaties that violate their own national interests. In this regard, the actions of the French ruling class are a prominent example, as they are personally helping to revive French militarism, Germany's long-time enemy.

The leaders of Britain, whether from the Conservative Party or the Labour Party, have long been acting as the little partners of the United States, that is, ensuring that they do not execute their own national policies but follow the American policy. Due to this policy, the British people have already suffered severe hardships, and the British Empire is on the verge of collapse. Despite this, the British propaganda machine still insists that the British Empire is being destroyed by the Communists. However, the ruling class of the British Empire cannot help but see the undeniable obvious fact: the territories of the British Empire are being seized, not by the Communists, but by the American billionaires. Already seized Canada, now seizing Australia and New Zealand, driving Britain out of the Suez Canal area, Latin America, the Near East, and the Middle East markets, and encroaching on the oil areas owned by Britain, are these the Communists or the American billionaires? The facts show: Britain has never had an enemy who has struck it so severely and bit by bit taken away its empire as its American "friend." This "friend" and Britain belong to the same bloc; it has established air bases on British territory, thereby putting Britain in a painful—I would say dangerous—situation; but it pretends to be the savior who rescues Britain from being "overthrown by Soviet Communism."

As for countries like Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia, which are supposed to be "free," they have already become colonies of the United States, and the rulers of Yugoslavia—all of them, Tito, Kardelj, Ranković, Đilas, and Bijedić—have long since become American agents carrying out espionage and sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries at the behest of their American masters.

The ruling classes of France, Italy, Britain, West Germany, and Japan have obediently followed the dictates of American imperialism and abandoned their own independent foreign policies. Indeed, these ruling classes have thereby betrayed their national interests and acknowledged their own bankruptcy. However, these classes prefer to sacrifice the national interests of their countries in order to obtain the assistance of their imperialist protectors across the ocean to suppress their own people, because they fear their own people more than they fear foreign imperialist slavery.

The right-wing Social Democrats, first and foremost the upper echelons of the British Labour Party, the French Socialist Party, and the West German Social Democratic Party, are also directly responsible for the anti-national policies of the ruling classes. The right-wing Social Democrats of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Austria, and other countries have followed in the footsteps of their comrades and have been fiercely opposing the democratic and peace-loving people's forces since the end of the Second World War. Today, the right-wing Social Democrats, in addition to playing their old role as the running dogs of their own bourgeoisie, are also acting as spies for foreign, American imperialism, carrying out the dirtiest tasks of preparing for war and opposing their own people.

The distinctive feature of American imperialist strategy is: the leaders use such a method as the basis for their war plans, that is, using the territory and military forces of other countries, first and foremost West Germany and Japan, as well as Britain, France, and Italy, that is, using the people of other countries to serve as blind weapons and cannon fodder in the American monopolists' struggle for world hegemony. However, at present, in the capitalist countries of Europe and other places, more sober and more progressive politicians, those who have not gone mad with hatred for the Soviet Union, have already clearly seen that the reckless American adventurers are dragging them into what abyss, and they have also begun to oppose the war. It must be said: in those countries that are destined to be obedient servants under the American dictators, there are truly peace-loving democratic forces that will implement their own independent, peaceful policies and find a way out of the predicament in which they are forced by the American dictators. The European countries and other countries that begin to take this new path will receive full understanding from all peace-loving countries. (Warm applause)

The American ruling class, in order to cover up their aggressive policy, is trying to pass off the so-called "cold war" against the democratic camp as a peaceful defense policy and to frighten their own people with the non-existent danger of a Soviet attack. One characteristic of the policy of the leaders of the Atlantic bloc is to use flattering words about peace to cover up aggressive plans and ongoing wars. The crux of the matter is that it is not easy to drive the people, who have recently suffered all the horrors of bloody massacres, into a new war, into a war against the peace-loving people. Therefore, the aggressive Atlantic wolves are so desperate to try to put on sheep's clothing. In such a situation, it is very dangerous to underestimate the malicious effect of the hypocritical peace disguise of today's aggressors.

With the progress of war preparations, an unprecedented wave of unbridled militarization has swept through the imperialist camp countries, affecting the entire life of the people in these countries, and the reactionaries are madly attacking the working people, while the entire system of these countries is being fascistized. The Hitlerite imperialists implemented fascism in their own country when preparing for the Second World War, while the current American imperialists, who are preparing for a new war, are implementing savage fascist rule not only in the United States but also in other countries—especially in countries like France, Italy, and Japan where the peace and democratic forces are particularly strong. The ruling classes of these countries are already carrying out the shameful missions ordered by the American military leaders, declaring war on their own people. Moreover, the American armed forces stationed abroad are performing the tasks of punitive police.

American imperialism is now not only an aggressor but also a world policeman, trying to strangle freedom everywhere and cultivate fascism.

Now, the hatred and resistance of the people oppressed by this world policeman are surging.

All this proves that the position of the imperialists is increasingly weakened, which makes the struggle between the fascist reactionary forces and the people's democratic forces within the imperialist camp more acute. This situation holds very serious consequences for the war provocateurs.

Due to the growing threat of war, a peace movement that involves the people of all countries is developing, and different classes and social strata are forming an anti-war alliance because the end of international tension and the prevention of a new world war are in their interests. The warmongers cannot say that this non-partisan peace democratic movement is their so-called Communist party movement. The Stockholm Appeal with five hundred million signatures and the declaration with more than six hundred million signatures calling for a peace pact among the five great powers have powerfully refuted the warmongers' claim and demonstrated the enormous scale of this non-partisan democratic movement for the defense of peace. The purpose of the peace movement is not to abolish capitalism, because this movement is not a socialist movement, but a democratic movement with billions of people participating. The demands and proposals put forward by the peace supporters will certainly help to maintain peace and prevent war. Under the current historical conditions, the achievement of this goal will be a great victory for the democratic and peace cause.

Now, the balance of power between the imperialist war camp and the democratic peace camp makes this prospect completely feasible. For the first time in history, there is a strong and united camp of peace-loving countries. In the capitalist countries, the working class is better organized than before, and powerful, democratic international organizations of workers, peasants, women, and youth have been established. The Communist Parties of all countries, which are fighting bravely for the cause of peace, have grown and strengthened. The people of all countries have deeply realized the necessity to fight against the new war threat, and the broad masses of the American people are also so, because once the war breaks out, they will suffer no less than the people of other countries. Although the United States has a great advantage in technology, the Korean War has already caused tens of thousands of casualties among the American people. It is not difficult to imagine: if the bloated American financial leaders throw the American people into a war against the peace-loving people, the sacrifices the American people will suffer will be how severe. The current task is to further enhance the initiative of the masses, strengthen the organization of peace defenders, tirelessly expose the true face of the war provocateurs, and not let them confuse the people with lies. Stopping and isolating the adventurous elements in the imperialist aggressor camp who, for the sake of profit, are not afraid to make the people suffer bloody slaughter—this is the main task of all progressive, peace-loving humanity. (Prolonged applause)

III. The Soviet Union's Struggle to Maintain and Strengthen Peace

The Party's basic principles in foreign policy have always been, and still are, a policy of international peace and ensuring the security of our socialist homeland. From the very first days of the establishment of the Soviet state, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has declared and actually followed a policy of international peace and international friendly relations. During the entire period between the two world wars, the Soviet Union consistently maintained the cause of peace and, on the international stage, exerted all its efforts to oppose the threat of war; it strove to promote collective security and collective opposition to the aggressors. The reactionary cliques of the United States and Western European countries obstructed the policy of collective security, encouraged Hitler's aggression, and thus led to the Second World War, which was not due to the fault of the Soviet Union.

On the one hand, our Party firmly adheres to the policy of peace, and on the other hand, it always keeps in mind the encirclement of hostile forces and tirelessly strengthens national defense to be fully prepared to deal with the enemy.

In 1939, when the flames of a new war had already been ignited, Comrade Stalin, at the 18th Party Congress, emphasized the basic principles of Soviet foreign policy, saying: "We maintain peace and strengthen our country's relations with all countries in the world, as long as they also maintain such relations with the Soviet Union and do not attempt to infringe upon our interests, we will always maintain this position."

At the same time, Comrade Stalin warned the aggressors: "We are not afraid of the aggressors' threats, and we are determined to respond to the blows of those who try to violate the inviolability of the Soviet borders with double blows."

When Hitler's Germany treacherously attacked our homeland, the Soviet people launched a crushing counterattack against the enemy and completely defeated him. The whole world saw that our Party is not just talking. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

After the end of the Second World War, the Party continued to pursue a foreign policy of ensuring lasting and solid peace and promoting international cooperation. The Soviet government proposed the well-known plan of measures to eliminate war.

The Soviet Union's love of peace is not only reflected in its proposals but also in its actions. After the war, the Soviet Union greatly reduced its armed forces, and now its armed forces in number do not exceed the pre-war forces. In a very short period after the war, the Soviet government withdrew its troops from the territories of China, Korea, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria, which had entered these countries during the war against the fascist invaders. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union believes that the struggle against the new war propaganda that hates humanity is of great significance in easing international tension; therefore, it passed the Law on the Defense of Peace on March 12, 1951, declaring war propaganda to be the most serious crime against humanity. Thus, it set an example for other countries.

In recent years, whenever there have been relatively serious and complicated events on the international stage, it is the Soviet Union that has proposed solutions, providing the basis for the peaceful resolution of disputes. Here, it is enough to point out that the proposal that became the basis for the Korean armistice talks was put forward by the Soviet Union.

The Soviet government attaches great importance to the United Nations, believing that it can become an important tool for maintaining peace. According to the United Nations Charter, the United Nations should be an institution of international cooperation. However, now, the United States is turning it into an organ for executing its own dictatorial policy against peace and using it to cover up its aggressive actions. The United States has set up a voting machine in the United Nations, creating many huge obstacles, but the Soviet Union, despite all this, is still defending the position of peace there and is striving to pass practical and feasible proposals based on the current international situation, the purpose of which is to curb the forces of aggression, prevent new wars, and stop wars where they are already taking place.

If one thinks that war can only be directed against the Soviet Union, that is wrong. Everyone knows that the First World War was launched by the imperialists, and at that time, the Soviet Union had not yet been born. When the Second World War began, it was also a war between capitalist countries, and the capitalist countries themselves also suffered heavy losses in this war. Today, the contradictions that have split the imperialist camp can lead to wars between capitalist countries. In view of all these circumstances, the Soviet Union is striving to prevent any kind of war between countries and is striving for the peaceful resolution of international conflicts and disputes.

However, the Soviet Union, which pursues a policy of maintaining lasting peace, has encountered the aggressive policy of the American ruling class.

Moreover, the warlike clique of the United States is trying to shift the blame onto others. They are doing everything possible to spread lies and fabricate the so-called threat from the Soviet side. These absurd clichés about the Soviet Union are not worth mentioning because they have no factual basis at all. Indisputable facts show who the real aggressor is.

Everyone knows that the United States is accelerating the expansion of armaments and refusing to ban atomic and bacteriological weapons, refusing to reduce peacetime armaments, while the Soviet Union proposes to ban atomic and bacteriological weapons and reduce other armaments and armed forces.

Everyone knows that the United States refuses to sign a peace pact, while the Soviet Union proposes to sign such a pact.

Everyone knows that the United States is organizing an aggressive bloc against the peace-loving people, while the treaties concluded by the Soviet Union and other countries have only one purpose, that is, to prevent the resurgence of Japanese and German aggression.

Everyone knows that the United States attacked Korea and attempted to enslave it, while the Soviet Union has not conducted any military actions anywhere since the end of the Second World War.

The United States is also waging aggression against China. It has seized Taiwan Island, which has always been Chinese territory. Its air force, in violation of internationally recognized legal norms, continually bombs Chinese territory. Everyone knows that the Soviet air force has not bombed anyone, and the Soviet Union has not seized any other country's territory.

The indisputable facts are as follows.

When talking about our relations with Britain and France, it must be said: these relations should be in accordance with the spirit of the treaties concluded with these two countries during the Second World War, which stipulate that we should cooperate with them in the post-war period. However, the British and French governments have blatantly violated these treaties. The rulers of Britain and France, in violation of their solemn promise of post-war cooperation with the Soviet Union when they were fighting a bloody war against German fascist slavery to liberate the European people, have completely colluded with American imperialism to execute aggressive plans against peace-loving countries. It is clear that due to the stance taken by the British and French governments, there is still much to be improved in our relations with these two countries.

The Soviet Union's attitude towards the United States, Britain, France, and other capitalist countries is clear, and we have repeatedly stated this attitude. Now, the Soviet Union is still willing to cooperate with these countries, that is, to jointly observe the international norms of peace and ensure lasting and solid peace.

(Applause)

Regarding the defeated countries—Germany, Italy, and Japan—the Soviet government is pursuing a policy that is fundamentally different from that of the imperialist countries.

The fact that the Soviet Socialist State is one of the victorious countries has created a completely new and unprecedented situation and possibilities for the peoples of all the defeated countries. For each country that signed the unconditional surrender agreement, the Soviet policy provides the possibility of peaceful, democratic development, the possibility of developing civilian industry and agriculture, the possibility of selling goods in foreign markets, and the possibility of establishing armed forces necessary for national defense. The Soviet Union, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, faithfully adheres to a policy aimed at the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the withdrawal of all occupying troops from Germany, and the establishment of a united, independent, peaceful, and democratic Germany; the Soviet Union believes that such a Germany, together with the peaceful Soviet Union, will make it impossible for there to be new wars in Europe and for the world imperialists to enslave the European countries. (Applause)

We have reason to hope: if the German people do not take the path that will turn them into mercenaries of the American-British imperialists, they will choose the correct path—the path of peace. (Applause)

The same applies to Italy; the Soviet Union hopes that the Italian brothers will fully restore their national independence. (Applause)

The Soviet government believes that Japan should also become an independent, democratic, and peace-loving country, as stipulated by the common decisions of the Allies.

The Soviet government refused to sign the one-sided treaty forced through by the American dictators at the San Francisco Conference because this treaty violates the principles of the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Yalta Agreement, and its purpose is to turn Japan into a military base for the United States in the Far East. The peoples of the Soviet Union deeply respect the Japanese people who are forced to endure foreign oppression, and they believe that the Japanese people will achieve national independence and take the path of peace.

The basis of the Soviet Union's policy of peace and the security of all nations is: if there is a willingness to cooperate and a willingness to fulfill the obligations undertaken, and if the principles of equality and non-interference in internal affairs are observed, then the peaceful coexistence and cooperation of capitalism and communism are quite possible.

The Soviet Union has always advocated and still advocates the development of trade and cooperation with other countries, regardless of differences in social systems. The Party will also pursue this policy in the future on the basis of mutual benefit.

However, the warmongers of the United States and Britain insist that only the expansion of armaments can fully utilize the industrial capacity of capitalist countries, but in reality, there is another prospect, that is, the development and expansion of trade relations between all countries in the world, regardless of differences in social systems. If this is done, the industries of industrially developed countries can produce in large quantities for many years to come, and certain countries that produce particularly large quantities of goods will certainly be able to sell them in other countries, and backward countries will be able to ensure economic growth, thereby establishing long-term economic cooperation.

The Soviet Union's pursuit of a peaceful policy is in complete harmony with other democratic, peace-loving countries—the People's Republic of China, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Mongolian People's Republic. The relations between the Soviet Union and these countries are an example of a completely new relationship between countries, which has never existed in history. The basis of this relationship is the principles of equality, economic cooperation, and respect for national independence. The Soviet Union honors its mutual assistance treaties, has provided and will continue to provide assistance and support to these countries, enabling these countries to be further consolidated and developed. (Stormy applause)

We believe that in the peaceful competition with capitalism, the socialist economic system will prove year by year to be superior to the capitalist economic system. However, we have no intention of forcing anyone to accept our ideas or our economic system. Comrade Stalin said: "Exporting revolution is nonsense. If a country wants a revolution, it will carry out its own revolution; if it does not want it, there will be no revolution."

While consistently adhering to the policy of peaceful cooperation with all countries in the world, the Soviet Union also takes into account the threat of new aggression by reckless warmongers. Therefore, the Soviet Union is strengthening its defensive forces and will continue to do so. (Applause)

The Soviet Union is not intimidated by the threats of the warmongers. Our people have experience in fighting against the aggressors, and in striking back at the aggressors. As early as the civil war period, when the Soviet state was still young and weak, our people had already given the aggressors a crushing blow, and during the Second World War, they also struck back at the aggressors. If the aggressors dare to attack our homeland in the future, our people will also give them a crushing blow. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

Historical facts cannot be ignored. These facts show: the result of the First World War was that Russia broke away from the capitalist system, and the result of the Second World War was that a series of countries in Europe and Asia broke away from the capitalist system. We have every reason to infer: the Third World War will lead to the collapse of the entire world capitalist system. (Prolonged applause)

It can be said that if the warmongers and aggressors impose a war on the peoples of all countries, the future and consequences of the war will be like this. However, there is also another prospect, the prospect of maintaining peace, the prospect of peace between the peoples of all countries.

This prospect requires the prohibition of war propaganda, the prohibition of atomic and bacteriological weapons, the gradual reduction of the armed forces of the great powers, the conclusion of a peace pact among the great powers, the expansion of international trade, the restoration of a unified international market, and other similar measures in the spirit of strengthening peace. The adoption of these measures will strengthen peace, eliminate the fear of war among the peoples of all countries, and put an end to the unprecedented waste of resources on the expansion of armaments and the preparation for destructive wars, thus making it possible to turn these resources to the benefit of the people.

The Soviet Union advocates the adoption of these measures and advocates the prospect of international peace.

(Stormy, prolonged applause)

The tasks of the Party in foreign policy are:

(1) To continue the struggle against the conspiracy for a new war, to prevent the outbreak of a new war, to form a powerful democratic anti-war front to consolidate peace, to strengthen friendly relations and unity with peace-loving people all over the world, and to tirelessly expose the preparations and tricks of the warmongers for a new war;

(2) To continue to pursue a policy of strengthening international cooperation and developing trade relations with all countries;

(3) To strengthen and develop the unbreakable friendly relations with the People's Republic of China, with the European people's democratic countries—Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania, with the German Democratic Republic, with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and with the Mongolian People's Republic;

(4) To tirelessly strengthen the defensive forces of the Soviet state and to intensify the preparation to give a fatal blow to any aggressor. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

    苏联共产党（布）中央委员会的报告
    ——苏联共产党（布）中央委员会书记马林科夫在苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会上所作
    （一）苏联的国际环境
    同志们，第十八次党代表大会以来的这一段时期充满了具有全世界历史意义的事件。
    第二次世界大战从根本上震动了许多民族和国家的生活，改变了世界的面貌。在国际帝国主义反动派的策划下，军国主义日本在东方和希特勒德国在西方分头发动了战争，然而这次战争却粉碎了战争煽动者的全部如意算盘，而且由于苏联人民的英勇斗争，这次战争以帝国主义者所没有预料到的结果结束了。
    结果并不是苏联的消灭或削弱，而是苏联更加强大了，它的国际威望更加提高了。结果并不是民主制度的削弱或毁灭，而是中欧和东南欧的几个国家脱离了资本主义体系，并在各该国确立了人民民主制度。结果并不是殖民地和附属国的人民遭受进一步的奴役，而是这些国家的民族解放斗争发生了新的、强大的高涨，帝国主义的殖民体系的危机尖锐化了。伟大中国人民的历史性的胜利是对整个世界帝国主义体系的严重打击。今天，全人类已经有三分之一摆脱了帝国主义的压迫，从帝国主义剥削的锁链下解放出来了。
    在资本主义世界本身，战争把三个大国——德国、日本和意大利——从强国名单中勾销了，法国和英国则失去了它们以前的地位。
    战后时期是世界资本主义体系进一步削弱和民主与社会主义力量日益壮大的时期。
    在经济方面，在战后的年代中，资本主义国家产生新的经济困难，美帝国主义尽量向外扩张以及因此而引起资本主义国家间矛盾尖锐化。由于帝国主义集团企图通过经济军事化和准备新的战争来摆脱经济困难，这些矛盾已经加剧了。
    在政治方面，战后时期形成了两个阵营——以美国为首的侵略的、反民主的阵营，以及爱好和平的、民主的阵营。在这个时期，一个新的反动和侵略的中心已在资本主义世界形成，它的具体化身就是美国，对于和平、自由及各国人民的民族独立的主要威胁就是从那里发出的。在这种危机面前，世界各国爱好和平的力量都已经起来进行坚决的斗争，以保卫和平与本国的民族独立。
    苏联在战后这段时期中，沿着第十八次党代表大会所指出的、曾为战争所中断的道路——和平发展和逐渐从社会主义过渡到共产主义的道路——继续行进。在战后年代中，工业、运输业和农业方面以及科学、文化和艺术各方面都取得了巨大成就，苏维埃制度得到了进一步的巩固，苏维埃社会的精神上和政治上的团结和我国各民族的友谊也得到了加强。在所有这几年中，苏联一直在为维护和巩固世界和平而进行积极的斗争。
    让我们来看一下国际形势的主要问题吧。
    一、世界资本主义体系的进一步削弱与资本主义各国的经济状况
    目前整个世界经济状况的特点有两条发展路线。一条路线是苏联和各人民民主国家和平经济的不断发展，这种经济不会遭遇危机，它的目的是使社会的物质和文化需要得到最大限度的满足。这种经济保证有步骤地提高人民大众的生活水准，并保证劳动力的充分就业。这种经济的特点是民主阵营各国家间友好的经济合作。
    另一条路线是生产力停滞不前的资本主义经济。这种经济正陷于愈来愈加深的资本主义总危机和经常反复发生的经济危机的困境中。这是经济军事化和军事生产部门片面发展的路线；这是许多国家相互竞争、某些国家奴役其他国家的路线。这种状况之所以产生，是因为这种经济的目的不是要增进社会的福利，而是要通过对本国大多数人民的剥削，并使其破产和穷困，通过对其他国家、特别是对落后国家的人民的奴役和经常的掠夺，最后通过战争和国民经济的军事化，来为资本家谋取最大的利润。
    苏联和资本主义国家的生产发展情况可用数字说明如下：
    一九二九年—一九五一年苏联和各资本主义国家工业产量增加的情形（以一九二九年为一百）
              苏联   美国    英国    法国   意大利一九二九年　一○○　一○○　一○○　一○○　一○○一九三九年　五五二　九九　  一二三　 八○　一○八一九四三年　五七三　二一七　——　——　——一九四六年　四六六　一五五　一一二　 六三　  七二一九四七年　五七一　一七○　一二一　 七四　  九三一九四八年　七二一　一七五　一三五　 八五　  九七一九四九年　八七○　一六○　一四四　 九二　  一○三一九五○年　一○八二　一八二　一五七　九二　  一一八一九五一年　一二六六　二○○　一六○　一○四　一三四
    从这个表上可以看出，苏联在一九五一年的工业产量为一九二九年的百分之一千二百六十六，在这个时期差不多增为一九二九年的十三倍。苏联工业在战后时期正如战前一样，在发展和平生产的基础上不断地向上发展。从这个表上也可以看出，美国的工业生产在一九二九年到一九三九年这一时期中停滞不前，以后才有了进展，但是这只是由于第二次世界大战期间军事生产量激增而引起的；后来大大下降，只是由于美国对朝鲜人民发动了战争转而加速扩张军备之后才重新上升，因此，一九五一年的数字到达了一九二九年的两倍。在同一时期内，英国的工业生产量只增加了百分之六十，而在西欧其他几个资本主义国家内，工业生产量仍然停滞在一九二九年的水平上下。
    在欧洲各人民民主国家中，虽然它们因战争而受到的损害比西欧资本主义国家更大，然而它们的工业产量到一九五一年就超过了战前水平：波兰增加到二点九倍，捷克斯洛伐克增加到一点七倍，匈牙利增加到二点五倍，罗马尼亚增加到一点九倍，保加利亚增加到四点六倍，阿尔巴尼亚增加到五倍多。这些国家的农业也在稳步地上升着，尤其是技术作物的生产增加得特别迅速；牧畜业方面也取得了相当大的成就。德意志民主共和国在发展经济方面获得了巨大的成绩。到一九五二年，该共和国的工业生产不仅已经恢复，而且超过了战前水平百分之三十六；一九五一年的工业生产量为一九四六年的二点四倍；冶金工业、机器制造业、化学工业和电力工业一年比一年发展。在农业方面，播种面积和收获量都超过了战前水平。
    中华人民共和国的经济正在迅速发展。中国人民正以极大的热情从事劳动，并且顺利地消除了许多年来在反对日本侵略者和国民党反动派的战争中所留下的严重后果。
    自从人民民主政权建立以来，中国的工业一直在以很快的速度发展着：和一九四九年相比，一九五一年的工业产量增加到两倍多；铁路运输已经恢复，新的铁路线的建筑正加速度进行中。中国的人民政府所实行的伟大的土地改革使得农业方面获得了巨大的成绩：一九五一年粮食生产达到一九四九年的百分之一百二十八，棉花生产达到一九四九年的百分之二百五十二。旧中国的国家财政陷于完全紊乱的状态，通货膨胀达到极高程度，而中国的人民政府则巩固了国家的财政，保证了货币的稳定。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国从日本殖民者的奴役下获得解放后，在经济方面获得了巨大的发展。在一九四九年，它的工业产量已较一九四六年增加四倍。在农村，自从人民民主政府实行了土地改革以后，播种面积就差不多增加了百分之二十五，所有各种农作物的单位面积产量都大大地增加了。美帝国主义的进攻打断了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民群众的和平建设工作。打着联合国旗帜的美国军队和其他国家的军队，正在野蛮地摧毁着北朝鲜的和平城市与乡村，摧毁着它的工业和农业。
    蒙古人民共和国在发展自己的经济方面，获得了巨大的成就。它的国民经济正在一年比一年地增长和巩固，蒙古人民的物质福利正在增进，他们的文化正在发展。这个国家的主要经济部门——牧畜业正在一往直前地发展，自从蒙古人民共和国建国以来，牲畜的数目已经增加到二倍半；而且所有牲畜现在都归劳动农民所有了。国营工业和合作社工业的产量在最近十年中差不多已增至三倍。
    表示资本主义国家和民主阵营各国生产发展情况的一切统计材料都证明：就发展速度来说，包括美国在内的资本主义国家的工业生产，比苏联和人民民主国家工业发展的速度落后得很多。
    其次，从这些统计材料中还可以看出：资本主义国家的工业生产的少许上升完全是进行战争准备和战争期间供应战争的结果。
    第二次世界大战不但没有消除资本主义的经济矛盾和政治矛盾，反而使得这些矛盾更加尖锐，震撼了资本主义国家的经济并加深了世界资本主义体系的总危机。第二次世界大战没有使各帝国主义国家的大资产阶级如愿以偿。在战争期间，两个相互攻打的资本主义集团各自都打算用武力来重新分割世界，打算攫取新的原料产地和扩大自己商品的销售市场，也就是说，打算牺牲它的敌手来巩固它自己的经济地位和达到世界霸权。
    但是这些打算都落空了。虽然德国和日本作为美、英、法三个主要资本主义国家的主要竞争者被打垮了，可是美、英、法三国、尤其是美国，要把本国工业生产提高到四、五倍以上的希望却破灭了。此外，中国和欧洲各人民民主国家脱离了资本主义体系，和苏联一道组成了与帝国主义阵营对立的一个统一的、强大的和平民主阵营。
    这两个对立阵营之组成的经济后果，正如斯大林同志所指出的，是统一的、无所不包的世界市场的解体和两个平行的世界市场、即和平民主阵营国家的市场和帝国主义侵略阵营的市场的出现。统一的世界市场的解体是第二次世界大战及其经济影响在经济方面的最重要的结果。
    这两个世界市场在两种相反的方向中发展。新的民主世界市场感受不到销售的困难，因为适应着民主阵营的生产之不受危机威胁的发展，它的容量一年比一年地增加，因为民主阵营中所有国家的生产量的不断增加使得民主市场的容量不断地扩大。另外一方面，还有一个世界市场，就是帝国主义市场，它和苏联及其他民主国家没有联系，因此，它一直在缩小，而且由于生产中的停顿和危机，群众的失业和穷困，以及它和民主国家断绝联系，它正在遭受着销售的困难。不仅如此，应该注意：由于统一的世界市场的解体，主要的资本主义国家——美国、英国、法国——可以取得世界资源的范围骤然缩小了。结果，资本主义世界市场日益缩小，在这个市场上销售货物的条件已经恶化，而且还要继续恶化下去。
    第二次世界大战对于各个不同的资本主义国家有不同的结果，这样就大大地改变了它们之间的经济关系。在参加这次战争的国家中，有许多国家的经济由于长期的战争和人力物力的损失，而遭受到深重的破坏。这首先是指德国、意大利和日本。法国、荷兰、比利时和若干其他国家也遭到了重大的损失。英国也削弱得非常厉害。
    美国靠战争发了财，美国亿万富翁巩固了自己的经济地位。然而，美国并没有能够达到它的目标，它没有能够建立美国资本在世界市场上的霸权。美国本来想在德国和日本被打垮之后自己的生产量增加到四倍或五倍。然而，它费尽力量才只使生产量增加到两倍，而现在则渐渐陷于经济危机之中。这是事实，美国目前至少有三百万人完全失业，半失业的人数更多。工人的群众性的罢工，使得美国亿万富翁愈加感到头痛。所以发生这些事情，都是因为美国工业丧失了苏联、中国和欧洲各人民民主国家这样的市场，而这只能怪美国统治集团。
    美帝国主义现在不仅是各国人民的国际剥削者和奴役者，而且也是破坏其余资本主义国家经济的一种势力。美国垄断资本趁它的竞争者衰落的机会，战后就夺取了资本主义世界市场的一大部分。它正在破坏各资本主义国家间在历史上形成的多角的经济联系，而代之以这些国家和美国之间的单方面的联系。美国垄断资本家使资本主义世界市场更加紊乱，他们一面用最无耻的倾销办法加紧输出他们自己的货物，一面不让外国货物进入他们的国内市场，结果美国人民喘息于高昂的物价之下。美帝国主义不让西欧国家从它们的过去东欧市场购买粮食，而西欧国家一向是向这些市场输出大量工业品以换取食物和原料的。
    美帝国主义的这种经济政策不能不使美国与其他资本主义国家之间的矛盾更加尖锐。这些矛盾中的主要矛盾仍然是美国和英国之间的矛盾，这种矛盾的表现形式是美国和英国垄断资本家公开进行斗争，争夺石油、橡胶、有色金属、稀有金属、硫黄和羊毛的来源地以及销售货物的市场。
    除此以外，还应当加上美国和日本、美国和意大利、美国和西德之间的极严重的矛盾——这些国家都是受美国独裁者的占领奴役的国家。如果认为这些战败的国家愿意永远处于美国占领者的铁蹄之下，那就太天真了。如果认为它们不会设法摆脱美国的桎梏而过自由独立的生活，那就太愚蠢了。
    由于美国资本主义在“援助”的藉口下，以贷款的方法侵入英国、法国和意大利的经济，攫夺英法殖民地的原料和销货市场，美国和英国以及美国和法国之间的矛盾正日益尖锐而且将更加尖锐。英国及跟在英国后面的法国和其他资本主义国家正在努力摆脱对美国的依附以便取得独立的地位和高额的利润。英国资本家为了反对美国对国际贸易的严密控制，已在展开着顽强的斗争。
    资本主义国家战后遇到的经济困难，因为帝国主义者自己对民主世界的市场关闭大门而益形严重。美国已将它与苏联和欧洲各人民民主国家的贸易削减到等于零的地步，并停止了对中国的贸易。它实际上不但禁止战败的国家（日本、西德和意大利）在民主阵营各国的市场上买卖货物，而且还禁止英国、法国、荷兰、丹麦、挪威、比利时和其他资本主义国家在民主阵营各国的市场上买卖货物。一九五一年美国和现在组成民主阵营的国家所进行的贸易仅及一九三七年的数字的十分之一；英国和这些国家的贸易减少到六分之一，法国的贸易则不及四分之一。
    美国、英国和法国本来以为，它们对苏联、中国和欧洲人民民主国家实行经济“封锁”，就能窒息这些国家。但实际的效果不是窒息而是加强了新的世界性的民主市场。这样，帝国主义者却使他们自己的出口贸易遭受到沉重的打击，并使他们的工业生产潜力和工业产品销路两者之间的矛盾更加加深。
    所有这些都意味着资本主义经济中已产生了更深刻的矛盾，整个世界资本主义经济体系比战前更为衰弱和更不稳定了。
    美国资本家知道这些经济困难，他们正力图用进行朝鲜战争、扩张军备和使工业军事化的办法来克服这些困难。
    美、英、法帝国主义者对朝鲜人民发动了反动的战争，煽起了反对民主阵营的战争歇斯底里，跟着便把他们本国的经济转上战争的轨道，并大规模地进行经济军事化和扩张军备的工作。在这些国家中，现在越来越大的一部分工业产量是用作军事装备的。在美国及其他资本主义国家的各主要工业部门中，军事定货起着决定性的作用。在各资本主义国家的预算中直接和间接扩张军备的费用所占的比重正在不断地增加。美国的直接军费在一九三七—一九三八会计年度为十亿美元，一九五二—一九五三会计年度增加到五百八十二亿美元，现在它占美国国家预算的百分之七十四，而在一九三七—三八年度则只占百分之十四；在同一时期内，英国的军事费用从一亿零七百万英镑增加到十六亿三千四百万英镑，占总预算的百分之三十四，而战前只占百分之十七；法国的军事费用现在几乎占总预算的百分之四十。
    这种军事费用的空前增加引起了不断的增税和更大规模的滥发纸币。资本主义国家的整个财政制度已由于战争和美国统治集团的政策而大为削弱，并继续日益恶化。通货贬值达到空前未有的程度。根据官方显然虚报的数字，美元在一九五一年的购买力只相当于一九三九年的百分之四十三，英镑在同一时期中下跌到只为原价值的百分之三十二，法国法郎跌到百分之三点八，意大利里拉跌到不及百分之二。
    向战争经济轨道上的转变，使得美国和其他资本主义国家有可能暂时提高工业生产的水平。资产阶级的经济学家正试图根据这一点来证明：大批的军事定货能无限期地维持“商业积极性”的高度水平。但是现实却推翻了这种武断。在今年，资本主义经济军事化特别加强的第三年，它的严重后果是越来越明显了。战争和通货膨胀的因素固然造成了暂时的景气，但同时却使资本主义国家的经济发展带上了片面的军事的性质。越来越多的货物和原料消耗在非生产的军事消费上，或者变成了不能流动的大量战略存货。同时，经济军事化就使他们用增税的手段来榨取人民的金钱。所有这些就把资本主义国家的预算变成亿万富翁掠夺人民的手段，大大缩小人民的购买力，降低对工业产品和农产品的需求，急剧削减民用品的生产，并造成严重的经济危机到来的条件。
    国民经济的军事化并不能消除生产能力和日益缩小的人民购买力之间的不平衡状态，相反地，它使这种不平衡状态更加严重了。资本主义国家的统治集团正把人民的购买力降低到最低限度，这就使得资本主义市场的容量不断缩小。因此，军事生产的扩张，必然会酿成新的更大的经济危机。
    扩张军备运动使美国的仆从国家的经济承担着特别沉重的负担。美国在发动朝鲜战争后，便对西欧国家增加压力，要求它们愈来愈全面地使它们的工业转上战争轨道，并以过多的拨款用来进行备战，从而剥夺了这些国家民用生产部门所需要的原料及物资。美帝国主义最后抛弃了资本主义国家经济
    “恢复者”的假面具。美“援”现在只供扩张军备之用，供准备新战争之用。英国、法国、意大利、西德、比利时、挪威及其他资本主义国家的统治者奉美国垄断资本之命而进行的扩张军备运动，正在破坏着这些国家的经济，并把它们推向灾难。
    亿万富翁使资产阶级国家从属于自己，指使它们执行准备新战争和扩张军备的政策，从而攫取巨大的利润。扩张军备成了亿万富翁、首先是美国的垄断资本家和亿万富翁空前致富的源泉。即使根据缩小了的官方统计，美国垄断资本家的利润从一九三八年的三十三亿美元就增加到一九五一年的四百二十九亿美元，即增加到十三倍。英国的大垄断资本家以及法国、意大利、日本及其他国家的垄断资本家也都获得巨额利润，虽然这些国家的经济处在长期的停滞状态中。同时，军事化已使人民群众的生活条件大大恶化。赋税的增加、日用必需品的涨价和通货膨胀加速了劳动人民相对的贫穷和绝对的贫穷。在美国，即使我们扣除了货币贬值所造成的虚数，本会计年度居民的直接税也还是等于一九三七年—一九三八年会计年度的十二倍多。在西欧各国，税收负担甚至在第二次世界大战以前就已十分沉重，而现在赋税又已增加，在英国增加为二倍，在法国增加为二点六倍，在意大利增加为一倍半。
    甚至根据官方显然缩小了的生活费和零售价格的指数，都证明物价在不断上涨，在美国发动对朝鲜的侵略之后，情形更加严重。在这种情况下，资本家在右翼社会党和反动工会领袖支持下实施的“冻结”工资的政策使工人和职员的实际工资大大降低了。在法国和意大利，一九五二年工人的实际工资不及战前的一半，而在英国则比战前减少百分之二十。在美国，根据电气工人工会的统计材料，生活费几乎上涨到一九三九年水平的三倍。尽管战争生产日益增加，资本主义国家的失业和半失业人数仍在不断增加。在意大利和西德，失业人数超过世界经济危机最严重的一九二九年—一九三三年那几年的水平；意大利有二百多万完全失业者，至于半失业者，就更多了，西德完全失业和半失业的人数几达三百万。
    在日本，完全失业或半失业的将近一千万人。美国完全失业的不下三百万人，半失业的有一千万人。英国的失业人数也在增加，那里的失业人数已超过五十万人。比利时这样一个小国，也有三十多万人失业。
    由于扩张军备而引起的广大阶层人民物质条件的不断恶化，引起了人民群众越来越大的不满，并使他们加强自己的斗争，来反对降低生活水平和反对整个准备新战争的政策。帝国主义资产阶级和工人阶级及全体劳动人民之间的阶级矛盾急剧地尖锐化，罢工运动的浪潮遍及整个资本主义世界。由于战争和殖民地及附属国民族解放斗争的新的高涨，帝国主义的殖民体系已在解体中，因而世界资本主义体系今天的处境就日益困难了。
    作为法西斯德国和军国主义日本失败的直接结果，帝国主义阵线在中国、朝鲜和越南被突破了，在这些以前是殖民地和半殖民地的地方兴起了人民共和国。中国人民的胜利更加使东方革命化并促成受帝国主义压迫的各国人民的解放斗争的高涨。在战后时期，殖民国家和殖民地之间的矛盾更加增大了。英国、法国、比利时及其他殖民国家正在设法把它们和美国的经济军事化所加给它们的重担，转嫁给殖民地。
    同时，美帝国主义则继续侵入这些殖民国家的殖民地和势力范围，在这些地区夺取阵地并加紧剥削殖民地和附属国的人民。在这种斗争的过程中，美国侵略者正在制造阴谋来反对他们的英、法“同盟国”，这样就以他们自己的行动进一步加深了帝国主义殖民制度的危机。
    许多殖民地和附属国（埃及、伊朗、叙利亚、摩洛哥、突尼斯等等）的领土正被用作军事基地而且它们的人民正被准备当做未来战争中的“炮灰”。
    由于帝国主义的长期压迫和封建残余的存在，殖民地和附属国的经济，特别是农业，就处于衰落状态中。在印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗和非洲各国中，数以千万计的人民经常在饥饿中生活着，大批的人沦为饿殍。帝国主义国家对殖民地和附属国所进行的掠夺性的剥削，阻碍了这些国家的生产力的发展，使这些国家的人民的购买力处在极低的水平上，缩小了工业品的市场。这一切像一盘磨石一样压住资本主义世界的经济，加深了整个世界资本主义体系的内部矛盾。
    殖民地和附属国的人民正日益坚决地反抗帝国主义奴役者。越南、缅甸、马来亚、菲律宾和印度尼西亚的人民正在进行的斗争，印度、伊朗、埃及和其他国家的民族抵抗运动的发展可以证明民族解放运动的规模正在扩大。
    二、国际形势的尖锐化。美英侵略集团所造成的新战争的威胁。各国人民争取和平的斗争
    战后美、英、法统治集团在国际关系方面的活动，也是在准备新战争的标志之下展开的。
    在第二次世界大战结束后，美国差不多马上就背弃了德黑兰、雅尔塔和波茨坦大国会议决议所奠定的、战时盟国所奉行的、大家同意的政策方针。美国以一系列的侵略行动，使国际形势尖锐化，使世界面临新战争的威胁。
    美国的统治者在叙述他们的侵略政策的目的时是十分露骨的。早在一九四五年，杜鲁门在就任美国总统后不久就宣布：“胜利……已把担负世界领导责任的长期重担放在美国人民身上了。”以后，杜鲁门和其他的美国政客们就一再扬言“美国要领导世界”。这种妄图统治全世界和征服所有其他国家的方针就是美帝国主义统治集团全部政策的基本精神。
    美国的首脑们当然知道：用和平方法是不能达到统治其他国家的目的的。希特勒匪帮也曾企图统治其他国家。美国首脑们从希特勒匪帮的经验中知道：不使用武力，不发动新战争，要想统治世界，那是不可想像的，因此他们决定破坏和平，准备新的战争。由于苏联是新战争的主要反对者，是和平的主要堡垒，美国的首脑们便得出了这样的结论：战争的矛头应该指向苏联和其他维护和平的国家。
    于是，背着苏联偷偷组织的北大西洋侵略集团就形成了。而且，为了欺骗人民，并在人民面前掩盖这个集团的侵略目的，他们扬言这是一个对付“共产主义”和苏联的“防御”集团，硬说苏联想进攻美国、英国、法国和这个集团的其他国家。
    为了同样的罪恶的目的，美国在邻近苏联边境的各国不断地设立军事基地。
    为了同样的罪恶目的，美国统治集团正在使西德和日本重整军备。
    在使西德和日本重整军备时，美国统治集团及其仆从们在全世界众目睽睽之下复活这两个第二次世界大战的温床；为了消灭这两个温床，全世界人民曾经在那次战争中流了大量的鲜血。
    美国对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的进攻，标志着美英集团从准备侵略战争过渡到直接的侵略行为了。朝鲜人民在英勇的中国人民志愿军的并肩作战下，正在英勇地保卫他们祖国的自由和独立，给和平的破坏者以反击；他们引起了全体民主与爱好和平的人类的热烈的同情。（暴风雨般的鼓掌）
    目前整个国际形势有许多具体特征和特点，其中必须加以详细叙述的如下。
    主要的侵略国美国，正在加紧迫使其他资本主义国家，首先是参加北大西洋集团的国家，以及在第二次世界大战中被击败的国家——西德、意大利和日本走向战争。美国统治者发号施令，为这个集团的全部成员国规定战争目的、战场和参战的部队，并决定其他有关备战的问题。
    美国统治者自称，他们所向往的是建立“自由国家集团”之类的理想。他们再三发表声明说，美国、英国、法国、土耳其和希腊代表这个“自由国家集团”，而据说苏联和各人民民主共和国则是“不自由的”国家。依我们看来，美国、英国、法国、土耳其及其他资本主义国家的确有“自由”，但这不是人民的自由，而是剥削和掠夺人民的自由。至于苏联和人民民主国家，在这里确实找不到这种自由，因为在这些国家中，剥削和掠夺劳动人民的自由早就被废除了。看，“美国生活方式”的鼓吹者所自夸的究竟是什么。（鼓掌）
    实际上，美国对其西欧和其他资本主义“朋友”的政策并不是民主的政策，而是帝国主义的政策。美国打着“反对共产主义”和“保卫自由”的旗帜，实际上强迫那些衰老的老牌资产阶级国家及其殖民地从属于美国，并对它们进行掠夺。像他们的前辈希特勒一样，美帝国主义者需要用“反共”的烟幕来转移人们对他们的真正侵略阴谋的注意力。
    美国在对英、法及其他资本主义国家实行帝国主义政策时，还厚着脸皮——说得轻一些——装做是这些国家的真正朋友。多好的一个朋友啊！他骑在他的小伙计们的身上，掠夺他们，奴役他们拼命揍打他们，还一再说“让我们做朋友吧”，这句话在美国阔老的口中是意味着：你先驮我，我再骑你。（笑声）
    英国、法国、荷兰、比利时和挪威这些一度自由的资本主义国家，现在实际上都抛弃了它们本国的政策，而执行着美帝国主义者指定的政策，把它们的领土让给美国作基地和军事跳板，从而使它们自己的国家在一旦战争爆发时遭受打击。它们为了向美国讨好，缔结了违反它们自己民族利益的同盟和公约。在这一方面，法国统治集团的行动是一个显著的例子，他们正亲手帮助复活法国多年的死敌德国军国主义。
    英国的首脑人物，不管是保守党的，还是工党的，很久以来就委身充当美国的小伙计，也就是保证不执行他们自己本国的政策而遵循美国政策。由于这种政策，英国人民已经遭受严重的苦难，大英帝国正在摇摇欲坠。尽管这样，英国宣传机关仍然硬说：毁坏大英帝国的是共产党人。然而大英帝国的统治集团不能不看见令人无可置疑的明显的事实：大英帝国的领地正在被人夺去，不是被共产党人夺去，而是被美国亿万富翁夺去。已经夺取了加拿大，正在夺取澳大利亚和新西兰，正在把英国从苏彝士运河区、拉丁美洲、近东和中东市场排挤出去，并且正在染指英国所拥有的石油区的，难道是共产党人而不是美国亿万富翁吗？事实说明：英国从来没有一个敌人像它的美国“朋友”那样给它这么严重的打击，并且从它的手中把它的帝国一片片地蚕食了去。这位“朋友”和英国属于同一个集团，它在英国领土上建立了空军基地，从而使英国处于一种痛苦的——我想说是危险的——境地；但它竟装做是拯救英国免被“苏维埃共产主义”覆灭的救主。
    至于像希腊、土耳其和南斯拉夫这样的“自由”国家，它们已经变成美国的殖民地，而南斯拉夫的统治者——所有铁托、卡德尔、兰科维奇、德热拉斯和比雅杰之流——则早已变成奉美国主子之命对苏联和人民民主国家进行间谍和破坏活动的美国特务了。
    法国、意大利、英国、西德和日本的统治集团已服服贴贴地听从美帝国主义的驱使，并放弃了他们本国的独立外交政策。诚然，这些国家的统治集团因此出卖了它们的民族利益，承认了他们自己的破产。但是这些集团却宁愿牺牲他们国家的民族利益，希望获得大洋彼岸的他们的帝国主义保护者的援助，以对付他们的人民，因为他们害怕人民甚于害怕外国帝国主义的奴役。
    右翼社会民主党人，首先是英国工党、法国社会党和西德社会民主党的上层领袖，对于统治集团的这个反民族政策也负有直接的责任。瑞典、丹麦、挪威、芬兰、奥地利以及其他国家的右翼社会党人步他们同道的后尘，从第二次世界大战结束以后，就一直疯狂地反对爱好和平的民主的人民力量。今天的右翼社会民主党人除了扮演本国资产阶级的走狗的老角色以外，还要给外国、美国帝国主义当特务，执行准备战争、反对本国人民的最肮脏的任务。
    美帝国主义的战略的特点是：它的头子们把这样的一种办法当做他们的战争计划的基础：使用外国的领土和外国的军队，首先是西德和日本的军队以及英国、法国和意大利的军队，也就是利用其他国家的人民，要他们按照美国战略家的计划，在美国垄断资本家争夺世界霸权的勾当中充当盲目的武器和炮灰。但是目前在欧洲以及其他地方的资本主义国家中，比较清醒和比较进步的政治家、那些没有因仇视苏联而弄得神经错乱的人们，已经清楚地看到轻举妄动的美国冒险家正在把他们拖进怎样的深渊，因此他们也开始反对战争。必须这样说：在那些注定要在美国独裁者手下充当恭顺走卒的国家里，可以找到真正爱好和平的民主力量，他们将实行自己的独立、和平政策，并能从美国独裁者逼迫他们所处的绝境中找到出路。开始走上这条新道路的欧洲国家和其他国家将得到所有爱好和平的国家的充分谅解。（热烈的鼓掌）
    美国统治集团为了掩盖他们的侵略政策，正试图拿对付民主阵营的所谓“冷战”来冒充和平防御政策，并以无中生有的所谓苏联发动进攻的危险来吓唬他们本国的人民。大西洋集团的头子们的政策的一个特点就是使用笼络人心的、关于和平的漂亮字句来掩盖侵略计划和已在进行的战争。问题的症结是，人民不久以前曾遭受过血腥大屠杀的一切痛苦，今天要驱使他们去进行新战争，驱使他们去进行对爱好和平人民的战争，并不是太容易的事。因此，侵略性的大西洋恶狼才那么费尽力气地设法披起羊皮。在这种情况之下，如果低估了今日侵略者假惺惺的和平伪装所发生的恶毒作用，那是很危险的。
    随着战争准备的进行，帝国主义阵营各国发生了空前的漫无约制的军事化浪潮，影响到这些国家人民的整个生活，反动派疯狂地向劳动人民进攻，同时这些国家的整个制度都在法西斯化。希特勒帝国主义者在准备第二次世界大战时在本国实行了法西斯主义，而目前，正在准备新战争的美帝国主义者，则不仅在美国、并且还在其他国家——主要在像法国、意大利、日本这样一些和平民主力量特别强大的国家——实行野蛮的法西斯统治。这些国家的统治集团已经在执行美国军阀吩咐的可耻使命，向他们的人民宣战。而且，派驻在美国国外的美国武装部队正在履行讨伐性的宪兵队的任务。
    美帝国主义现在不仅是一个侵略者，而且是一个世界宪兵，他尽力之所能在各地绞杀自由，并培植法西斯主义。
    现在，受它压迫的人民反对这个世界宪兵的仇恨的和抵抗的浪潮已在增涨。
    这一切都证明了帝国主义者的地位的日趋削弱，这就使帝国主义阵营内部各帝国主义国家法西斯反动势力和人民民主力量之间的斗争急剧加紧。这种局势，对战争挑拨者来说，是孕育着非常严重的后果的。
    由于日渐增长的战争威胁，一个把各国人民都卷入其中的和平运动正在开展，不同的阶级和社会阶层正在组成反对战争的联盟，因为结束国际紧张局势和防止新的世界大战是符合他们的利益的。战争贩子们没有办法把这个非党派的和平民主运动说成为他们所谓的共产党党派运动。斯德哥尔摩宣言有五亿人签名，要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言有六亿多人签名，这个事实极其有力地驳斥了战争贩子的这种说法，同时显示了这个保卫和平的非党的民主运动的巨大规模。和平运动的目的不是消灭资本主义，因为这个运动不是一个社会主义运动，而是一个有亿万人民参加的民主运动。和平拥护者提出的要求和建议一定有助于维护和平与防止战争。在现在的历史条件下，这个目标的达到将是民主与和平事业的巨大胜利。
    现在帝国主义战争阵营与民主和平阵营之间的力量对比，使这个前途完全能够实现。在历史上第一次有了一个强大而团结的爱好和平的国家的阵营。在资本主义国家，工人阶级比以前更好地组织起来了，工人、农民、妇女和青年的强大的、民主的国际组织建立起来了。为和平事业而进行英勇斗争的各国共产党都成长壮大起来了。一切国家的人民都深切地认识到有必要对新战争威胁进行斗争，美国的广大群众也是如此，因为一旦战争爆发，他们遭受的灾难不会比其他国家的人民少些。尽管美国在技术方面占很大的优势，可是朝鲜战争已使美国人民受到几十万人的伤亡。不难想像：如果大腹便便的美国金融首脑们把美国人民投入反对爱好和平的人民的战争中去，美国人民受到的牺牲将会是何等惨重。目前的任务就是更加提高人民群众的积极性，加强和平保卫者的组织，不倦地揭露战争挑拨者的真面目，不让他们用谎言迷乱人民的视听。制止和孤立那些一味为了追求利润而不惜使人民遭受血腥的屠杀的帝国主义侵略者阵营中的冒险分子——这就是一切进步的爱好和平的人类的主要任务。（经久不息的鼓掌）
    三、苏联为维护和巩固和平而斗争
    党在外交政策方面的基本方针一向是、现在也还是国际和平与确保我们社会主义祖国的安全的政策。自从苏维埃国家成立的最初几天起，苏联共产党就宣布并实际遵循了国际和平与国际友好关系的政策。在两次世界大战之间的整个时期，苏联始终一贯地维护和平事业，并在国际舞台上以全力反对战争的威胁；它曾努力推行集体安全和集体反对侵略者的政策。美国和西欧国家的反动集团阻挠集体安全政策，鼓励希特勒侵略，从而引起了第二次世界大战，这并不是由于苏联的过错。
    我们党一方面坚定不移地执行和平政策，另一方面也时刻记着敌对势力的包围，不倦地加强国防，以便有充分准备地对付敌人。
    在一九三九年，当新的战争的烈火已经燃烧起来的时候，斯大林同志在第十八次党代表大会上强调指出了苏联外交政策的基本原则，他说：“我们维护和平，并巩固我国与世界各国间的事务上的联系，只要它们也对苏联维持这样的关系，而不来试图侵犯我国利益的时候，我们是始终都保持这个立场的。”
    同时，斯大林同志向侵略者发出警告说：“我们不怕侵略者底恫吓，而决计用双倍的打击，去回答那些试图破坏苏联疆土不可侵犯性的战争挑拨者底打击。”
    当希特勒德国背信弃义地进攻我们祖国的时候，苏联人民对敌人进行了歼灭性的反击，并且把它彻底打垮了。全世界都看到，我们党并不是空口说白话的。（暴风雨般经久不息的鼓掌）
    在第二次世界大战结束后，党继续执行保障持久巩固的和平和促进国际合作的对外政策。苏联政府提出了人所周知的杜绝战争的措施的计划。
    苏联的热爱和平不仅表现在它所提出的建议上，而且表现在它的行动上。在战后，苏联大大裁减了它的武装部队，它现在所有的武装部队在数量上并没有超过战前的部队。在战后极短的时期内，苏联政府把它的军队从中国、朝鲜、挪威、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫和保加利亚的领土上撤退回来，这些军队是在对法西斯侵略者作战时开进这些国家的。苏联最高苏维埃认为，对仇恨人类的新战争宣传所进行的斗争，在缓和国际紧张局势上是有很大作用的；因此它在一九五一年三月十二日通过了保卫和平法案，宣布战争宣传是对人类的最严重的罪行。这样，它就给其他国家树立了榜样。
    最近几年来，当国际舞台上发生比较严重的错综复杂的事件的时候，总是苏联提出建议，为和平解决争执的问题提供了基础。这里，只要指出，成为朝鲜停战谈判的基础的建议就是苏联提出来的。
    苏联政府十分重视联合国，认为它可以成为维持和平的重要工具。按照联合国宪章，联合国应该是一个国际合作的机构。但是，现在，美国却在把它变成执行它自己的独裁政策反对和平的机关，并且利用它来掩盖自己的侵略行动。美国在联合国中布置了一架表决机器，制造许多巨大的障碍，然而苏联不顾这一切，还是在那里保卫着和平的阵地，而且正在努力争取在那里通过根据目前国际形势而提出的切实可行的建议，这些建议的目的在于抑制侵略势力，阻止新的战争，并且在已有战争进行的地方制止战争。
    如果以为战争可能仅仅是反对苏联的，那就错了。大家都知道，第一次世界大战是帝国主义者发动的，那时苏联还没有诞生。第二次世界大战开始的时候也是资本主义国家间的战争，而且资本主义国家自己也在这次战争中受到严重的损失。今天使帝国主义阵营发生分裂的矛盾，是可能引起资本主义国家之间的战争的。鉴于所有这些情况，苏联正在努力阻止任何种类的国与国间的战争，它努力争取和平解决国际冲突与纷争。
    然而，奉行维护持久和平的政策的苏联，却碰到美国统治集团的侵略政策。
    而且，美国的好战集团正竭力想嫁祸于他人。他们正在尽一切可能大肆进行撒谎的宣传，制造所谓苏联方面的威胁的谎话。这些关于苏联的荒谬的滥调，根本不值一提，因为它们都绝对没有事实根据。无可辩驳的事实说明了究竟谁是侵略者。
    人人都知道，美国正在加紧扩张军备，并拒绝禁止原子武器和细菌武器，拒绝裁减平时军备，而苏联则建议禁止原子武器和细菌武器并裁减其他军备和武装部队。
    人人都知道，美国拒绝缔结和平公约，而苏联则建议缔结这样的公约。
    人人都知道，美国正在组织对付爱好和平人民的侵略集团，而苏联和其他国家缔结的条约却只有一个目的，就是制止日本和德国侵略的再起。
    人人都知道，美国进攻了朝鲜，并企图奴役它，而苏联自从第二次世界大战结束以来从来没有在任何地方进行过任何军事行动。
    美国也在对中国进行侵略。它强占了素来是中国的领土——台湾岛。它的空军违反举世公认的国际法准则，不断地轰炸中国的领土。人人都知道，苏联空军没有轰炸任何人，苏联也没有强占任何别国的领土。
    无可辩驳的事实就是这样。
    在谈到我们与英国和法国的关系时，必须说：这种关系是应该符合我们在第二次世界大战期间与这两个国家缔结的条约的精神的，这些条约规定我们与它们在战后时期要互相合作。但是，英国和法国政府却悍然地破坏了这些条约。英国和法国的统治者，违背了他们在苏联为了从德国法西斯的奴役下解放欧洲人民而进行流血战争的时候向苏联提出的战后合作的庄严保证，竟然彻头彻尾地与美帝国主义者串通一气，来执行反对爱好和平国家的侵略计划。很明显，由于英国和法国政府采取这种立场，我们与这两个国家的关系还有许多尚待改进的地方。
    苏联对美国、英国、法国以及其他资产阶级国家的态度是明白的，我们方面已经多次申明过这种态度。现在，苏联仍然愿意和这些国家合作，也就是共同遵守和平的国际准则并保障巩固持久的和平。
    （鼓掌）
    对于战败国——德国、意大利和日本，苏联政府执行着在原则上和帝国主义国家的政策完全不同的政策。
    苏维埃社会主义国家是战胜国之一，这一事实为各战败国的人民创造了完全新的和前所未有的局面与各种可能性。对每一个签订了无条件投降协定的国家，苏联的政策提供了和平、民主发展的可能性，发展民用工业和农业的可能性，在国外市场上销售货物的可能性，建立国防所必需的国家武装部队的可能性。苏联遵照波茨坦协定，信守不渝地奉行着一个旨在尽速缔结对德和约、一切占领军从德国撤退及建立一个统一的、独立的、爱好和平的、民主的德国的政策；苏联认为，这样一个德国和爱好和平的苏联之并肩存在就使得欧洲不再有新战争的可能，并使世界帝国主义者奴役欧洲国家成为不可能。（鼓掌）
    我们有理由希望：如果不走上面那条道路就会变成美英帝国主义者的雇佣兵的德国人民，将选择正确的道路——和平的道路。（鼓掌）
    对于意大利也是一样，苏联希望意大利兄弟人民完全恢复他们的民族独立。（鼓掌）
    苏联政府认为，日本也应该像盟国的共同决议所规定的那样，成为一个独立的、民主的和爱好和平的国家。
    苏联政府拒绝签署美国独裁者们强使旧金山会议通过的片面条约，因为这个条约破坏了开罗宣言、波茨坦公告和雅尔塔协定的原则，而且其目的是要把日本变为美国在远东的军事基地。苏联各族人民深为尊重被迫忍受外国压迫的日本人民，他们相信日本人民将使他们的祖国获得民族独立，并走上和平的道路。
    苏联所奉行的和平与各民族安全的政策的根据是：如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，而且平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那末资本主义与共产主义的和平共存和合作就是十分可能的。
    苏联过去一直主张、现在仍然主张发展与其他国家的贸易与合作，而不问其社会制度的差异。党将来也将在互利的基础上执行这个政策。
    而美国和英国的好战分子却硬说，只有扩张军备，才能使资本主义国家的工业能力得到充分利用，然而实际上另外还有一种前途，这就是发展和扩大世界各国之间的贸易关系，而不问其社会制度的差异。只要这样做，工业发达的国家的工业就能够在今后许多年中大量生产，某些国家出产特别多的货物也一定能够在其他国家销售，落后国家就能保证经济的上升，从而建立长期的经济合作。
    苏联奉行和平政策，这样，它和其他民主的、爱好和平的国家——中华人民共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国——是完全和谐一致的。苏联和这些国家之间的关系是各国之间的一种完全新的关系的范例，这种关系是历史上从来不曾有过的。这种关系的基础是平等、经济合作和尊重民族独立的原则。苏联信守它的互助条约，曾经给予而且今后将继续给予这些国家以援助和支持，使这些国家得到进一步的巩固和发展。（暴风雨般的鼓掌）
    我们相信，在和资本主义进行和平竞赛之中，社会主义的经济制度必将一年比一年更清楚地证明它比资本主义经济制度优越。但是我们并无意强迫任何人接受我们的思想或我们的经济制度。斯大林同志说：“输出革命是胡说。每一个国家如果要求革命，就将自己进行它的革命；如果不要求，那就不会发生革命。”
    苏联一方面始终不渝地遵循着与世界各国和平合作的政策，一方面也考虑到有肆意妄为的战争贩子发动新侵略的威胁存在。因此，苏联正在加强它的防御力量，而且还要继续加强。（鼓掌）
    苏联并没有为战争贩子的威胁所吓倒。我们的人民有着与侵略者进行斗争的经验，在打击侵略者方面，他们并不是生手。早在内战时期，当苏维埃国家还很年轻、力量还比较弱的时候，我们的人民就曾给侵略者以痛击，在第二次世界大战的时候，他们也打击了侵略者，假如侵略者将来胆敢进攻我们的祖国，我们的人民也将给他们以打击。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的鼓掌）
    历史事实是不能置之不顾的。这些事实说明：第一次世界大战的结果，俄国脱离了资本主义体系，而第二次世界大战的结果，欧洲和亚洲的却有一系列的国家脱离了资本主义体系。我们有种种理由来推断：第三次世界大战会引起全世界资本主义体系的崩溃。（经久不息的鼓掌）
    可以这样说，如果战争贩子和侵略者把战争强加在各国人民的头上的话，战争的前途和后果就是这样。但是现在也存在着另一个前途，即保持和平的前途，各国人民之间和平的前途。
    这种前途要求遵照联合国所通过的决议禁止战争宣传，禁止原子武器和细菌武器，有步骤地裁减大国的武装部队，缔结大国和平公约，扩大国际贸易，恢复统一的国际市场以及其他本着加强和平的精神的类似措施。采取这些措施就会加强和平，就会免除各国人民对于战争危险的恐惧，就会终止在扩张军备和准备毁灭性战争上面的空前的物资消耗，这样就有可能把这些物资转而用到人民福利上面。
    苏联主张采取这些措施，主张国际和平的前途。
   （暴风雨般的经久不息的鼓掌）
