    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th — In the period around the U.S. side's planned interruption of the armistice negotiations, incidents of slaughtering prisoners of war in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps have significantly increased. On October 14th, fifteen of our captured personnel were injured again on Geoje Island. According to successive announcements by the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp authorities, since October 1st, in Geoje Island and Jeju Island alone, a total of seven slaughter incidents have occurred, resulting in more than 210 deaths and injuries among our captured personnel. Acheson, Clark, and others are still clamoring that "prisoners of war cannot be forcibly repatriated," but they are constantly killing prisoners of war by force.

    The frequent slaughter incidents indicate that the U.S. side is intensifying a large-scale and unspeakable conspiracy in the prisoner-of-war camps. According to disclosures by U.S. authorities, the U.S. side is also "transferring" prisoners of war from the camps under the guise of so-called "interrogations," but this has been resolutely rejected by the prisoners of war or has aroused protests from other prisoners of war. The U.S. side dares not explain why the prisoners of war refuse or protest the "transfer" and the whereabouts of these "transferred" prisoners of war. The facts are very clear: the so-called "transfer" is that the U.S. side is arbitrarily arresting Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in various camps and sending them to unspeakable places. Recently, U.S. generals have been clamoring to use more Rhee's puppet troops to act as a shield for the U.S. military, which has suffered heavy casualties in the war of aggression. However, the losses of Rhee's puppet troops are constantly increasing. Therefore, the U.S. side's large-scale arrest of prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camps is very likely related to this conspiracy.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th — On October 14th, the U.S. side injured fifteen of our captured personnel again on Geoje Island. General Nan Ri, Chief Delegate of our delegation to the Korean Armistice Negotiations, protested this incident to the other side, pointing out that the endless stream of incidents of abuse, persecution, and slaughter of prisoners of war by the other side completely proves the utter bankruptcy of all the pretexts used by the other side in attempting to detain prisoners of war. The other side must bear full responsibility for every bloody war crime of massacring prisoners of war.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th — In the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, another twenty-six of our captured personnel were injured on the 13th and 14th. According to a report by United Press, on the 13th, the U.S. side injured seven prisoners of war when "transferring prisoners of war from one camp to another." On the 14th, because the prisoners of war protested the U.S. side "summoning" a prisoner of war "for interrogation," another four prisoners of war were injured by the U.S. side. According to a report by Associated Press, the U.S. side also injured fifteen prisoners of war on the 14th because the prisoners of war protested the U.S. side "taking away" four prisoners of war "for interrogation."

    From all these revealed messages, it can be seen that the U.S. side is intensifying new conspiratorial activities of forcibly detaining prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camps. Not only are individual prisoners of war constantly being "summoned for interrogation," but also entire batches of prisoners of war are being "transferred" to other places. If the prisoners of war protest these unspeakable "interrogations" and "transfers," the U.S. side uses American-style "humanitarian" methods to persecute them. The U.S. side now makes no secret of their attempt to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations, and it is clear that they are determined to forcibly detain more prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder for expanding the war of aggression.

    美方中断谈判前后屠杀战俘事件显著增加
    南日将军抗议美方又打伤我方战俘十五人
    【新华社开城十八日电】在美方有计划地中断停战谈判的前后，美方战俘营中屠杀战俘的事件显著地增加。十月十四日，在巨济岛又打伤我方被俘人员十五名。根据美方战俘营当局历次宣布：十月一日以来，仅仅在巨济岛及济州岛两地，已共发生屠杀事件七次，打死打伤我方被俘人员二百一十多人。艾奇逊、克拉克等仍在叫嚣“不能用武力遣返战俘”，但是他们正不断地用武力杀害战俘。
    频繁的屠杀事件表示：美方在战俘营中正在加紧推行大规模的不可告人的阴谋。据美方当局透露：美方并以所谓“询问”等为名把战俘“调离”营场，但遭到战俘坚决拒绝，或者引起其他战俘的抗议。美方不敢说明战俘为何拒绝或抗议“调离”，及这些被“调离”的战俘的下落。事实非常明显：所谓“调离”，就是美方在各个营场内恣意逮捕朝中战俘，把他们送到不可告人的地方去。近来美国将军们都在叫喊要用更多的李伪军去替在侵略战争中大量伤亡的美国军队挡头阵。而李伪军的损失却在不断增加。因此，美方在战俘营内大肆逮捕战俘的行为，极可能与这一阴谋有关。
    【新华社开城十八日电】十月十四日美方在巨济岛又打伤我方被俘人员十五人。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军对此事件向对方提出抗议，指出：层出不穷的对方虐待迫害屠杀战俘的事件完全证明了对方企图扣留战俘的一切藉口的彻底破产。对方对每一次虐杀战俘的血腥战争罪行必须负完全责任。
    【新华社开城十八日电】在巨济岛美方战俘营中，十三日和十四日又有我方被俘人员二十六人被打伤。据合众社报道，十三日美方在将战俘“由一个营场迁移到另一个营场”时，打伤战俘七人。十四日，由于战俘抗议美方将战俘一人“传去审问”，又有四名战俘被美方打伤。另据美联社报道，美方在十四日还打伤了十五名战俘，因为战俘抗议美方将四名战俘“带走加以询问”。
    从所有这些透露出来的消息，可以看到美方正在战俘营中加紧进行新的强迫扣留战俘的阴谋活动。不仅有个别的战俘被不断“传去询问”，而且有整批的战俘被“迁移”到旁的地方去。如果战俘对这些不可告人的“询问”和“迁移”表示抗议，美方就用美国式的“人道主义”的办法来加以迫害。美方现在已经毫不掩饰他们破坏朝鲜停战谈判的企图，显然他们决心要强迫扣留更多的战俘来充当扩大侵略战争的炮灰。
