    The People's Songs, The Nation's Songs
    – On Several Musical Programs of the Romanian Army Song and Dance Ensemble
    Li Ling
    The performances of the Romanian People's Republic Army Song and Dance Ensemble in our country have been warmly welcomed by our people. These song and dance arts with national characteristics express the happy life of the Romanian people as they move towards socialism, fully revealing their love for life and their praise for labor.
    The Romanian people, liberated from the oppression of foreign imperialism and domestic rulers, have gained freedom, and the literary and artistic works that have been suppressed and stifled for many years have also been fully developed. This army song and dance troupe, headed by Monescu Corneilius, was established after the liberation of Romania, and it has only been five years, but it has already achieved good results. They have performed more than 200 kinds of music and dance programs. In addition to performing for the troops and working people in Bucharest and other cities in Romania, they have toured the country 11 times and performed in Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia. Most of the members were selected from soldiers, workers, and artists. This year, the Ministry of Armed Forces of the Romanian People's Republic awarded medals to their song and dance troupe, the head of the troupe, and some of the members.
    Among the musical programs they performed, "Young Gheorghe Has Joined the Army" (music by Dinu Stelian) is very popular with the audience. This song describes how enthusiastically the Romanian youths joined the People's Army, and the young people who joined the army felt honored and proud to become soldiers defending their motherland. The musical language of the song is inherited from the great tradition of Romanian folk music and art. The author loves the folk art of his motherland, enhances and enriches it, so that these new melodies with strong national characteristics profoundly and kindly express the new life emotions of the people, and express the style of the young troops. The song describes a team of young people joining the army, walking happily and resolutely from afar. As the steps get closer, the singing gradually becomes loud and warm. When writing about their arrival in the ranks, the song shows unparalleled optimism and pride, making people feel the heroism and respect of the People's Army. The conductor of this song, Stelian, is the author himself. Through his handling, this song becomes more moving.
    "Threshing Wheat," which expresses the harvest labor of collective farm members, is also a very good song. It makes people feel the enthusiastic emotions of the farm members in the tense work and their laughter and singing and dancing. This song was originally a cello solo composed by composer Constantin Dumitrescu based on a Romanian folk song, originally called "Peasant Dance", and now conductor Stelian has adapted and developed it into a chorus, which is even richer. Their enthusiastic and brisk singing reminds me of the scene of visiting collective farms in Romania last year: parents were working happily in the fields, and children were singing in the farm's nursery; those innocent children hugged us when they saw us entering. This is really a new life, a new life that is completely different from the past and carefree.
    "Tribulus Terrestris" and "Hi-Liu-Liu" both leave a deep impression. "Tribulus Terrestris," composed by Ion Dumitrescu, is a song praising the collective farm. "Hi-Liu-Liu," composed by Dinu Stelian, is a song about a weaving girl, describing her working hard on the spinning machine to weave more cloth to make clothes for her lover and the working people. These two songs also have the style of folk music, and those folk music languages ​​are more beautiful and profound after being processed by the composer. They make us feel the rich and beautiful folk music art of Romania.
    There are also several songs, such as "Doina" (mountain song or love song), "Competition Song", "Green Leaves of Violet Flowers", etc., which will be loved by our people. The themes of these songs are interspersed with descriptions of love, making the singing more intimate and full of life. Due to the addition of Romanian-specific national musical instruments in the orchestra accompaniment, the color of the music is more prominent.
    Romania has a long tradition of folk music and art. In Bucharest, the music department of the Folk Art Research Institute, established in 1949, has collected more than 30,000 folk music works. Especially the deep love of their people's composers, such as Sokol, Mendelssohn, and Annescu, for their nation, and the efforts of the Workers' Party and the government to develop national music, have enabled Romanian music and art to develop so rapidly after liberation. Just as Monescu Corneilius, the head of the army song and dance troupe, said: "You can see in our performances new programs for peace and socialism, and you can also see programs that express the labor and hopes of our ancient people."
    In addition, the general mass songs performed by the Romanian Army Song and Dance Ensemble are also very characteristic. "The Party's Banner" (music by Mateusko) expresses the Romanian people's high love for the Romanian working class party led by Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, and the singing is full of the people's hope and trust. The loud and beautiful singing of soloists Trofi Nicolaie and Nagu Aurelian comrades makes the emotion of this song more prominent. The chorus successfully portrayed the people's love for the party and the leader. This song is extremely popular among Romanian youth. "Song of the Peace Warriors" (music by Chilescu) won the second prize at the international song competition "Singing Peace and Friendship between Peoples" sponsored by the Romanian Composers Association. Due to the simplicity and smoothness of the melody, it has become a well-known mass song in Romania. Anatol Vieru's "Ode to Stalin" is loved by the masses in Romania, and it was also warmly welcomed when it was performed in our country.
    There is also a cantata "Tudor Vladimirescu" (excerpt from a large chorus composed by George Domitrescu) describing the Romanian national hero, which is also a successful work. When I was in Romania, I had heard the performance of the People's Army Band, and its full version was sung by a mixed chorus with children's voices. In that "Romanian Music Week" of seven or eight days of performances, "Tudor" was the most outstanding program. Tudor Vladimirescu was the leader of the Romanian peasant revolution and a national hero who resisted foreign aggression. This cantata tells the story of him leading the peasants to resist the landlords and resist foreign enemies. He finally sacrificed heroically. The first section of the song tells the people's support for him and his hard struggle with the people, and the later section tells the people's concern for him after he was arrested, and the continued efforts of the successors. When expressing his sacrifice, the chorus enthusiastically sang the Romanian people's admiration for this great hero, their hatred for the violent enemy, and their confidence in the victory of the revolution.
    We cannot forget the several Chinese songs performed by the Romanian People's Republic Army Song and Dance Ensemble in Chinese, because they are full of friendship and internationalism towards our people. They performed our Chinese songs "The East is Red" and "People of the World Unite Closely" in a healthy and powerful manner.
    We wish the Romanian people's art will continue to advance and become more brilliant!

    人民的歌声、民族的歌声
    ——谈罗马尼亚部队歌舞团的几个音乐节目
    李凌
    罗马尼亚人民共和国部队歌舞团在我国的演出，受到了我国人民的热烈欢迎。这些具有民族风格的歌舞艺术，表现了罗马尼亚人民在向社会主义迈进中的幸福生活，充分流露出他们对生活的热爱，对劳动的歌颂。
    从外国帝国主义和国内统治者的压迫下解放出来的罗马尼亚人民获得了自由，多年来被压抑窒息的文学艺术也得到了充分发展的机会。这个以莫耐斯古·考尔耐利乌为首的部队歌舞团是在罗马尼亚解放以后才成立的，至今不过五年，但已有很好成绩，他们共演出了二百多种音乐舞蹈节目。除了在罗京布加勒斯特及其他城市为部队和劳动人民演出外，曾在国内巡回公演十一次，并到匈牙利、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克表演过。团员多半是从战士、工人和艺术工作者中选拔的。今年，罗马尼亚人民共和国武装部队部曾颁给他们歌舞团、团长和一部分团员以勋章。
    他们演出的音乐节目中，“青年吉奥尔基查参军了”（第努·斯德立扬曲）是很受观众欢迎的。这首歌曲描述了罗马尼亚的青年们如何热烈地参加人民军，参军的青年为了自己能成为保卫祖国的战士而感到光荣和骄傲。歌曲的音乐语言是从罗马尼亚伟大的民间音乐艺术传统中继承过来的。作者热爱自己祖国的民间艺术，把它提高和丰富，使这些带有浓厚民族风格的新的旋律，深刻而又亲切地表现了人民新的生活情感，表现了年青的部队的风貌。歌曲描写一队参军的青年，从远方愉快而坚毅地走来，随着步伐的走近，歌声也渐渐嘹亮，热烈。在写他们到达队伍以后，歌曲更显示出无比的乐观和骄傲的感情，使人感到人民军队的英勇和可敬。这首歌的指挥者斯特立扬就是作者自己。通过他的处理，使这支歌曲更加动人。
    表现集体农庄庄员们丰收的劳动的“打麦”，也是一首很好的歌曲。使人感觉到庄员们在紧张的工作中的热烈情绪和他们的欢笑和歌舞的情况。这首歌原是作曲家康斯坦丁·杜米特莱史古根据一首罗马尼亚民歌编成的大提琴独奏曲，原名为“农民舞曲”，现在经指挥斯德立扬把它改编，发展为合唱曲，就更加丰富了。他们热情而轻快的歌声，使我想起去年在罗马尼亚参观集体农庄的情景：父母在田地里愉快地工作，孩子在庄内托儿所唱着歌；那些天真的孩子看见了我们进去，就拥抱不放。这真是一种新的生活，一种完全不同于过去的，无忧无虑的新生活。
    “蒺藜草”和“嗨——溜——溜”给人的印象都是很深的。依翁·杜米特莱史古作曲的“蒺藜草”，是一首歌颂集体农庄的歌曲。“嗨——溜——溜”由第努·斯德立扬作曲，是一首织布姑娘的歌，描写她在纺织机旁突击工作，要织出更多的布匹，替她的爱人和劳动人民做衣裳。这两首歌曲也具有民间音乐的风格，那些民间音乐的语言经过作曲者的加工，显得更加优美和深刻。它们使我们感到罗马尼亚的人民音乐艺术的丰富美丽。
    还有几首歌，如“多依娜”（山歌或情歌）、“竞赛歌”、“紫萝兰花的绿叶”等，都会为我们的人民所喜爱。这些歌曲的主题中穿插着爱情的描写，使歌唱更加亲切而富于生活味。由于乐队伴奏中加入了罗马尼亚特有的民族乐器，使音乐的色彩更为突出。
    罗马尼亚有着悠久的人民音乐艺术传统。在布加勒斯特，一九四九年起成立的民间艺术研究院的音乐部门，已经搜集了三万多首民间音乐作品。特别是他们的人民作曲家，如索可尔、曼德尔宋、安尼斯古等对自己民族的深厚爱情，和工人党及政府为发展民族音乐的努力，因此使罗马尼亚的音乐艺术在解放以后很快就有了这样大的发展。正像部队歌舞团团长莫耐斯古·考尔耐利乌所说的：“你们可以在我们的演出中看到那些为和平为社会主义斗争的新节目，也可以看到表现我们古老人民的劳动和希望的节目。”
    此外，罗马尼亚部队歌舞团的一般群众歌曲的演出，也是很有特色的。“党的旗帜”（马台梭考作曲）表现了罗马尼亚人民对领袖乔治乌—德治同志所领导的罗马尼亚工人阶级的政党的高度的热爱，歌声中充满着人民的热望与信任的情绪。独唱者特罗菲·尼克莱耶及纳古·阿乌列利安同志的嘹亮而优美的歌声，使这首歌曲的感情更为突现。合唱队把人民对党、对领袖的热爱的情绪描绘得很成功。这首歌在罗马尼亚青年中是异常流行的。“和平战士之歌”（奇莱斯古作曲）这首歌曲曾在罗马尼亚作曲家协会主办的国际“歌唱和平及人民间友谊”歌曲比赛会上获得第二奖。由于旋律的简洁、流畅，使得它在罗马尼亚成为一首家喻户晓的群众歌曲。安那托·维也罗的“斯大林颂”在罗马尼亚为广大群众所爱唱，在我国演出时，也同样地受到热烈的欢迎。
    还有一首描写罗马尼亚民族英雄的清唱剧“图道·弗拉狄米莱士古”（乔治·多米特来士古作曲的大合唱选曲），也是成功的作品。我在罗马尼亚时曾听过人民军乐团的演出，它的全曲是由加插童声的混声合唱团歌唱的。在那次“罗马尼亚音乐周”七、八天的演出中，“图道”是最为特出的节目。图道·弗拉狄米莱士古是罗马尼亚农民革命领袖，也是反抗外族侵略的民族英雄。这个清唱剧就是描写他领导农民反抗地主及抵御外敌的故事。他最后英勇地牺牲了。歌曲的前段叙述人民对他的拥护，以及他和人民在一起的艰苦斗争，后段述说他被捕后人民对他的关怀，和后继者继续的努力。在表现他牺牲时，合唱团热情地唱出了罗马尼亚人民对这个伟大英雄的敬仰，对暴敌的愤恨，以及对革命胜利的信心。
    我们不能忘记罗马尼亚人民共和国部队歌舞团用中国语言演出的几首中国歌曲，由于他们充满了对我国人民的友谊和国际主义精神。他们把我国歌曲“东方红”“全世界人民团结紧”表现得健康有力。
    我们祝罗马尼亚人民艺术日益前进，日益辉煌！
