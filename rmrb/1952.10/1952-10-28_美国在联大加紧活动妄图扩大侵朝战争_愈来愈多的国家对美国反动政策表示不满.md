Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: The Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, which opened in New York on the 14th of this month, temporarily concluded its general debate on the 20th. The situation in the first stage of the meeting shows that the United States is stepping up its efforts to transform the United Nations into a tool of its aggressive policies, continuing and expanding the Korean War, although the United States is by no means smooth sailing in promoting its plans. On the other hand, the countries of the peaceful and democratic camp, led by the Soviet Union, are waging unyielding struggles to maintain international peace and security, and resolutely defending the position of peace in the United Nations.

The Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly was convened under the circumstances of the deep crisis of the United States' war policy, especially the tragic failure of the unjust war of aggression against Korea. In order to use the United Nations General Assembly to shirk its responsibility for undermining the Korean armistice negotiations and to coerce and lure other countries to participate more in the Korean War, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, in his speech during the general debate on the 16th of this month, openly stated that the United States was determined to perpetuate the Korean War until it "suffices to deter aggression and restore peace and security in Korea," and blamed its vassal states for being "timid and fearful," demanding that they "unanimously support" the U.S. aggressive stance in the United Nations General Assembly "like one person." Seeing the strong emotions of peace-loving people around the world against war and demanding peace, as well as the doubts and dissatisfaction of many countries in the United Nations about the expansion of the Korean War, Acheson did not dare to show his fangs and claws in this speech and put forward specific demands for vassal states to contribute manpower and money. Instead, he deliberately lowered his tone, trying to cover up his sinister intentions with a disguised moderate posture, and then step by step lured these countries deeper into the bottomless pit of the Korean War. However, Acheson's assistant, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Hickerson, revealed his thoughts outside the United Nations venue. At the annual United Nations Week gathering of the "American Association for the United Nations" on the 19th of this month, Hickerson openly shouted, "We intend to try our best at the United Nations General Assembly to get those member states that have not yet assumed their responsibilities in Korea to assume their responsibilities. There should be more troops in Korea now, ready to fight for as long as necessary." The Associated Press Washington dispatch on the 21st also revealed that "the United States has urged United Nations member states to send more army, navy, and air force personnel to Korea to help the United States increase pressure on the Communists."

Completely opposite to the United States' reactionary policies, the countries of the peaceful and democratic camp, led by the Soviet Union, have taken a clear stand against war and in defense of peace from the very beginning, and put forward specific proposals that conform to the interests of all peace-loving people. On the second day after the start of the general debate, the Polish delegation put forward proposals for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, a one-third reduction in armaments by the five major powers, and the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers. Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky delivered a speech on the 18th of this month, requesting the General Assembly to support the Polish delegation's proposals. In his speech, Vyshinsky clearly elaborated Stalin's peaceful diplomatic policy and relentlessly exposed the war policies of the U.S.-British bloc. Vyshinsky pointed out that the fundamental reason for the United States' refusal to achieve an armistice in Korea was for the maximum profit of a few monopoly capitalists. He said that the United States' refusal to allow the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the work of the United Nations was intolerable to any country that valued the United Nations. Vyshinsky once again announced that the Soviet delegation would defend the position of peace in the United Nations. Vyshinsky announced to the opinion circles of the capitalist world a fact that the United States has timidly concealed to this day: the Korean and Chinese side had put forward specific proposals to the United States on October 8 to solve the issue of prisoners of war, but the U.S. military command had brazenly interrupted the negotiations without replying. The huge impact of Vyshinsky's speech made the U.S. ruling clique and its kept newspapers feel very embarrassed.

Despite the United States' use of various obstructive means and attempts to make other countries obey the will of the United States, the General Assembly still passed the proposals of Poland on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the issue of racial discrimination in South Africa, the issues of Morocco and Tunisia, and the issue raised by the Czechoslovak delegation regarding U.S. interference in the internal affairs of other countries—sabotage and espionage activities against the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies—on the agenda. There is no doubt that the discussion of these issues, especially the Korean issue and the issue of imperialism's implementation of colonial oppression, will give the imperialist group a huge blow morally and politically. In this session of the United Nations General Assembly, more and more countries have expressed dissatisfaction with the reactionary policies of the United States. They are finding it increasingly difficult to endure the oppression of the United States and are expressing their unwillingness to follow the leadership of the United States on this or that issue. This situation was most evident when the General Assembly discussed whether to include the issue of racial discrimination in South Africa on the agenda. The President of the General Assembly, Pearson, a faithful servant of the United States, suggested at the meeting that the General Assembly vote on whether it had the right to consider this issue. This illegal ruling was opposed by an overwhelming majority of 43 votes. In addition to the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, all Arab and Asian countries, almost all Latin American countries, and many other countries voted against this ruling. Only the delegations of ten imperialist colonial countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, voted in favor of Pearson.

Currently, the United Nations General Assembly has entered its second stage, and the Political Committee has begun to discuss the Korean issue. The United States is conducting intense conspiratorial activities inside and outside the venue, attempting to lure other countries to contribute manpower and money to continue and expand the Korean War. Hickerson revealed in the aforementioned speech he gave almost a week ago: "When the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly debates the United Nations' actions in Korea in a week or two, this (effort to get other member states to assume their responsibilities in Korea) activity will reach its climax." On this point, peace-loving people all over the world must wage a resolute struggle to completely crush this conspiracy of the United States.

### 美国在联大加紧活动妄图扩大侵朝战争  愈来愈多的国家对美国反动政策表示不满

    美国在联大加紧活动妄图扩大侵朝战争
    愈来愈多的国家对美国反动政策表示不满
    【新华社二十七日讯】本月十四日在纽约揭幕的第七届联合国大会，已于二十日暂时结束一般辩论。会议第一阶段的情况表明：美国正加紧推行它变联合国为侵略政策的工具，继续和扩大朝鲜战争的计划，虽然美国在推行它的计划时决不是一帆风顺的；另一方面，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营国家，则正为维护国际的和平与安全进行不屈不挠的斗争，在联合国中坚决保卫和平的阵地。
    第七届联合国大会是在美国战争政策陷入深重危机，特别是侵略朝鲜的不义战争遭到悲惨失败的情势下召开的。为了利用联合国大会来推脱破坏朝鲜停战谈判的责任，并胁迫和诱骗其他国家更多地参加朝鲜战争，美国国务卿艾奇逊本月十六日在进行一般辩论时发表的演说中，公开表示美国决心使朝鲜战争持久化，一直打到所谓“足以遏止侵略与恢复朝鲜的和平安全为止”，并责备仆从国家“胆小怕事”，要求它们在联合国大会上“像一个人一样一致地支持”美国的侵略立场。艾奇逊看到全世界爱好和平的人民反对战争、要求和平的强烈情绪以及联合国中很多国家对于扩大朝鲜战争的疑惧和不满，没有敢在这篇演说里张牙舞爪地提出要仆从国家出人出钱的具体要求，而是故意放低了调子，企图以伪装温和的姿态来掩盖他阴险的祸心，然后一步一步地诱骗这些国家更深地陷入朝鲜战争的无底洞。可是，艾奇逊的助手、美国助理国务卿希克逊却在联合国会场以外，一语道破了他的心事。希克逊于本月十九日在“美国联合国同志会”每年举行的联合国周集会上公然喊叫“我们打算在联合国大会上尽量争取那些还没有负起它们在朝鲜的责任的会员国负起责任。在朝鲜现在应该有更多的军队，能够随时把战斗进行到必要的时间。”合众社华盛顿二十一日的消息也透露了“美国已敦促联合国会员国家派遣更多的陆海空军，前往朝鲜，协助美国对共产党增加压力”。
    与美国的反动政策完全相反，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营国家一开始就采取了反对战争、维护和平的鲜明立场，并提出了符合一切爱好和平人民利益的具体建议。在一般辩论开始以后的第二天，波兰代表团就提出了和平解决朝鲜问题、五大国裁减军备三分之一、五大国缔结和平公约等项建议。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在本月十八日发表演说，要求大会支持波兰代表团的建议。维辛斯基在演说中明确地阐明了斯大林和平外交政策，并对美英集团的战争政策予以无情的揭露。维辛斯基指出了美国拒绝在朝鲜停战的根本原因是为了少数垄断资本家的最大利润。他说美国不让中华人民共和国的合法代表参加联合国的工作，是任何重视联合国的国家所不能容忍的。维辛斯基又一次宣布，苏联代表团将在联合国中保卫和平的阵地。维辛斯基向资本主义世界的舆论界宣布了一件美国至今怯懦地加以隐瞒的事实：朝中方面在十月八日就向美国提出了解决战俘问题的具体建议，然而美军司令部未予答复就悍然中断了谈判。维辛斯基演说所发生的巨大影响，使美国统治集团及其御用报纸感到十分狼狈。
    尽管美国使用各种阻挠手段，并企图使其他国家服从美国的意志，大会仍然通过将波兰关于和平解决朝鲜问题等项的建议、南非种族歧视问题、摩洛哥和突尼斯问题以及捷克斯洛伐克代表团所提关于美国干涉他国内政——对苏联、中国和人民民主国家进行破坏和间谍活动——的问题等列入议程。毫无疑问，这些问题，特别是朝鲜问题和帝国主义实行殖民压迫问题的讨论，将在道义上、政治上给予帝国主义集团以巨大的打击。在这届联合国大会中，愈来愈多的国家对美国的反动政策表示不满。它们越来越难以忍受美国的压迫，正在这个或那个问题上表示不愿追随美国的领导。在大会讨论是否将南非种族歧视问题列入议程时，这种情况表现得最为明显。大会主席、美国的忠实奴仆皮尔逊在会上建议表决大会是否有权审议这个问题。这一非法裁决遭到四十三票绝大多数的反对。投票反对这个裁决的，除苏联及人民民主国家以外，还有所有阿拉伯国家和亚洲国家、几乎所有的拉丁美洲国家以及许多其他国家。投票支持皮尔逊的只有美、英、法等十个帝国主义殖民国家的代表团。
    目前，联合国大会已进入第二阶段，政治委员会已开始讨论朝鲜问题。美国正在会场内外进行紧张的阴谋活动，企图诱骗其他国家出人出钱，以继续和扩大朝鲜战争，希克逊在差不多一星期以前发表的上述那篇演说中就已透露：“联合国大会政治委员会在一两个星期内辩论联合国在朝鲜的行动时，这个（争取其他会员国负起它们在朝鲜的责任）活动，将达于顶点。”对于这点，全世界爱好和平的人民必须进行坚决的斗争，以彻底粉碎美国的这一阴谋。
