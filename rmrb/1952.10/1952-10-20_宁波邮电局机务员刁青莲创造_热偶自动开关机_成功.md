    Ningbo Postal and Telecommunications Bureau Mechanic Diao Qinglian Successfully Creates "Thermal Couple Automatic Switch Machine"
    To the Editor: Diao Qinglian, a mechanic in the machine room of the Ningbo Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Zhejiang Province, has successfully created a "thermal couple automatic switch machine" after a year of painstaking research since October of last year. This is a new contribution to the telecommunications industry.
    The advantage of the "thermal couple automatic switch machine" is that it enables mechanics to freely control machines in remote locations. In the past, when mechanics started work, they had to first notify the machine room in the remote location and ask them to turn on the machines before they could begin their work. This was not only troublesome and wasteful of manpower, but also affected work when the remote mechanics were off duty or busy.
    Since Diao Qinglian created the "thermal couple automatic switch machine," not only can the mechanics sending and receiving telegrams freely switch the machines of remote radio stations on and off, but one mechanic can also operate many machines. According to preliminary estimates, it can save manpower by half. Fu Yimin

    宁波邮电局机务员刁青莲创造“热偶自动开关机”成功
    编辑同志：浙江省宁波邮电局机务室机务员刁青莲，自去年十月份开始，经过一年的苦心钻研，创造“热偶自动开关机”成功，这是电信事业上的一个新贡献。
    “热偶自动开关机”的优点是：能使机务员自由掌握远地的机器。从前，机务员开始工作时，必须先通知远地的机务室，叫他们把机器打开，然后才能进行工作。不但手续麻烦，浪费人力，而且遇到远地的机务员脱班，或工作忙时，就要影响工作。
    自从刁青莲创造“热偶自动开关机”后，不但收发电报的机务员能自由开关远地电台的机器，而且一个机务员就能操纵很多机器。据初步估计，可节省一倍人力。  傅亦民
