    The Patrol Inspection System Is a Good Way to Prevent Accidents
    Comrade Editor: Workers in the Power Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant are learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and implementing a scientific patrol inspection system, which has prevented many accidents.
    In the past, when workers were in charge of blowers, although there was a "six diligence" system of diligent looking, diligent listening, diligent smelling, diligent touching, diligent checking, and diligent connecting, they could not grasp the key points and were just blindly busy. After implementing the scientific patrol inspection system, the above situation has changed by checking the machines at fixed times according to the importance of each part, distinguishing between urgency and slowness. Since the implementation of the scientific patrol inspection system, accidents in the Power Department have been greatly reduced. The workers said: "The experience of the Soviet elder brother is great. It not only prevents accidents and ensures safe operation, but also makes work less busy and less tiring." Shi Gang Xuan

    巡回检查制是防止事故的好办法
    编辑同志：石景山钢铁厂动力部工友学习苏联先进经验，实行科学的巡回检查制，防止了很多事故。
    过去，工人看管送风机，虽也有勤看、勤听、勤嗅、勤摸、勤检查、勤联系的“六勤”制度，但是抓不着要害，只是盲目地忙乱。实行科学巡回检查制后，按机器各部的重要性，分别缓急定时检查，就改变了以上情况。自从实行科学巡回检查制度后，动力部事故大大减少。工人说：“苏联老大哥的经验真棒，不但防止事故安全运转，工作起来也不忙不累。”　石钢宣
