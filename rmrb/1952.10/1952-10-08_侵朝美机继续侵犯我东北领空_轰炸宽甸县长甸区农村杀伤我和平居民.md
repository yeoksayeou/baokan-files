Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th: On October 1st, American planes invading Korea again intruded into our northeastern airspace in multiple batches, and indiscriminately bombed rural areas of Changdian District, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province.

On this day, a total of 32 batches of 120 American planes intruded into the airspace of five cities and counties including Andong, Kuandian, Fengcheng, Ji'an, and Tonghua for harassment. American B-29 bombers that intruded into the airspace above Changdian District, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, dropped 32 bombs in Laba Village and Shanghekou Village in the district at 2:16 p.m. on the same day, wounding one woman in Laba Village and destroying part of civilian housing.

In the previous four days (September 27th to 30th), 392 American planes had already invaded our northeastern airspace.

While the American aggressors unreasonably demanded a ten-day recess at Panmunjom and insisted on their so-called three proposals aimed at detaining our prisoners of war, they continue to take serious provocative actions against the People's Republic of China, continue to invade our northeastern airspace, and bombed and killed our peaceful residents during our National Day holiday. This clearly proves that the American aggressors have consistently deliberately delayed and even disrupted negotiations, and attempted to expand the war. The above-mentioned serious crimes of American imperialism, which are hostile to the Chinese people and disregard the world's people's desire for peace, have aroused great anger among the Chinese people. They must bear the responsibility they should bear for this. Peace-loving people all over the world must also pay serious attention to the American conspiracy to further endanger peace.

    侵朝美机继续侵犯我东北领空
    轰炸宽甸县长甸区农村杀伤我和平居民
    【新华社沈阳七日电】十月一日，美国侵朝军飞机多批再次侵入我国东北领空，并在辽东省宽甸县长甸区农村滥施轰炸。
    这天，美机共三十二批一百二十架次侵入我安东、宽甸、凤城、辑安、通化等五个市县的上空进行骚扰。侵入辽东省宽甸县长甸区上空的美国B—29型轰炸机，于当日二时十六分在该区喇叭村和上河口两村投弹三十二枚，炸伤喇叭村妇女一人，炸毁民房一部。
    在此以前的四天（九月二十七日至三十日）中，并已有美机三百九十二架次侵犯我国东北领空。
    美国侵略者一方面在板门店无理要求休会十天，并提出坚持其旨在扣留我方战俘的所谓三项建议，另一方面又继续对中华人民共和国采取严重挑衅行动，继续侵犯我国东北领空，并在我国国庆节日轰炸杀伤我和平居民，这显然证明美国侵略者一贯蓄意拖延乃至破坏谈判，并企图扩大战争。美帝国主义上述存心与我国人民为敌，并无视全世界人民对和平的渴望的严重罪行已经引起我国人民的极大愤怒。他们必须负起他们对此所应负的责任。全世界爱好和平人民也必然要严重注意美国进一步危害和平的阴谋。
