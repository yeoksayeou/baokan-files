    Several Issues in the East China Region's Autumn and Winter Peak Season Materials Exchange
    Yang Haolu, Deputy Director of the Trade Department of the East China Military and Administrative Committee
    One of the important experiences gained by the East China region in carrying out urban-rural materials exchange work is the holding of urban-rural materials exchange conferences at all levels. It can organize materials exchange in a planned way according to the production and sales relationship of materials in various places, in order to support production and improve production, so that production and sales can gradually achieve planning and overcome blindness. After the closing of the East China Regional Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Conference this summer, more than 300 materials exchange conferences were held in markets at all levels throughout East China, with a total purchase and sales volume of 9.6 trillion yuan, further deepening materials exchange into primary markets below the county level, greatly improving the economic life of the vast rural areas, expanding the market for urban industrial production, educating our broad cadres, criticizing the one-sided view of emphasizing production and neglecting exchange, and raising the correct understanding of the policies of the People's Government and the enthusiasm for production and operation of many private industrialists and businessmen. This has laid the foundation for welcoming the market prosperity of the autumn harvest peak season.
    This year, except for some areas in East China that have suffered some disasters and therefore reduced production, in general, a better harvest than last year has been obtained, and the purchasing power of the vast rural areas will undoubtedly be further improved. Since July, the business situation in most cities has been better than the same period last year; entering September, the primary markets in counties and towns close to the countryside, where autumn crops have already been put on the market, have shown universal activity. Zhejiang Province and the Southern Jiangsu region held autumn urban-rural exchange conferences at the end of September and the beginning of October, respectively. The number of private industrialists and businessmen participating in the conference was unprecedented, and the number of transactions was also unprecedented. There were 7,500 representatives and traders participating in the Zhejiang exchange conference, and nearly 7,000 representatives and traders participating in the Southern Jiangsu exchange conference. The number of transactions in both places reached 17,000 or 18,000. About 90% of the representatives or private businessmen participating in the exchange are private industrialists and businessmen from primary markets in counties and below, which is a different characteristic of the autumn and winter peak season materials exchange and the summer materials exchange. The reason why these private industrialists and businessmen from rural towns actively participate in the materials exchange conferences in the intermediate markets of provinces and regions is, on the one hand, because the private businessmen have learned the policies of the People's Government from the summer materials exchange and recognized their future, so they have generally become active; on the other hand, they have seen that the purchasing power of the rural areas has already appeared in the market after the autumn harvest. Many of the merchants from the primary markets who participated in the exchange conferences in Zhejiang or Southern Jiangsu came and went twice to trade in the less than half-month session. They brought goods back immediately at the beginning of the exchange, quickly sold them out, and then rushed to the conference to exchange again. We can not only see the operational enthusiasm of private industrialists and businessmen in the primary markets from this, but also explain that the prosperity of the autumn and winter markets has arrived this year. All staff engaged in state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial activities and private industrialists and businessmen must pay full attention to this situation and actively take action to do a good job in autumn materials exchange under the state plan and the leadership of the state-owned economy.
    The urban-rural materials exchange work in the autumn and winter peak season is obviously different from the summer materials exchange and has new characteristics: the agricultural harvest is abundant, and at the same time, with the support of the country's reasonable price policy, the purchasing power of the rural areas will be greatly improved; state-owned trading companies, in the off-season of production in the first half of this year, in order to support urban industrial production, accumulated supply power and carried out huge amounts of processing orders, mastering a large number of industrial products, which can be supplied to farmers and the market in a planned way, but there are still many seasonal production and sales and industrial products and handicrafts produced in various places, which must be organized for exchange in a planned way; major autumn harvest crops, such as grain, cotton, tobacco, hemp, and tea, are purchased in large quantities by the state through cooperatives, while general small local specialties should be encouraged for private merchants to actively operate; after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the summer materials exchange, state-owned trading companies and cooperatives have gradually corrected their policies and strengthened their leadership over the market; private industrialists and businessmen, after the "Five-Anti" movement and the summer materials exchange, are constantly giving play to their enthusiasm for independent operation, but some people still show considerable blindness in operation and dependence in terms of funds. According to these new situations and characteristics, the following issues should be paid attention to when organizing the autumn harvest peak season materials exchange work.
    First, we must strengthen the planning of exchange conferences at all levels and overcome blindness. The purpose of the materials exchange conference is to promote commercial activities and promote the normal circulation of materials in a planned way, in order to regulate production and sales, and promote the normal development of production, so that the market becomes a more organized and led market. At present, the circulation of goods, from the perspective of different commodities, major agricultural products and mechanical industrial products have strong planning due to the large amount of control and operation by the state-owned economy and cooperatives; scattered small local specialties and general handicrafts, although most of them have sales channels, there are still more blindness in production and sales. From the perspective of different markets, the blindness of commodity production and sales in rural areas is even greater due to the relatively concentrated cities and extremely scattered rural areas. Various industrial products, handicrafts, and small local specialties, except for a few that have no prospects for development due to blind production or being unsuitable for the needs of the masses, all have their reasonable production and sales relationships. Materials exchange conferences at all levels should first clarify the basic production and sales of goods (including local specialties, industrial products, and handicrafts) in various places, find out the reasonable production and sales relationship of goods, and determine which goods should be placed in the primary market (a certain area), which should be placed in the intermediate market or the senior market exchange conference to solve, and formulate practical exchange plans, in order to organize the exchange in a purposeful and planned way. Through such extensive and purposeful exchange conferences at all levels, it is possible to promote the normal circulation of materials in a planned way, make the blind market a more organized and led market, reasonably solve production and sales contradictions, and promote the normal development of production. However, attention must be paid to mastering: major agricultural products that are generally purchased by the state or through cooperatives, major industrial products that are planned to be supplied, and a few minor materials that have been proven from all aspects to be blindly produced or crudely manufactured, unsuitable for the needs of the masses, and have no prospects for development, should not be used as the focus of exchange. Because the former has been planned and controlled by the state for purchase and sale, and the latter should be improved and reorganized in terms of production, if they are organized for exchange as the focus again, it will disrupt the purchase and sale plan, destroy the rational circulation of materials, and affect the normal development of production, and also waste the power of organizing and leading materials exchange conferences at all levels, making us unable to concentrate our efforts to grasp the problems that must be solved and can be solved.
    Second, we should widely mobilize private merchants in the primary markets of the region to participate according to the specific purpose and exchange plan of each exchange meeting, and purposefully invite representatives from other regions to participate in the exchange. The exchange conferences in Zhejiang Province and Southern Jiangsu this time widely mobilized the merchant representatives of small towns in the region to participate, which is completely correct, and the active participation of private merchants in various small towns is also completely normal. Because the autumn harvest peak season exchange is different from the summer (off-season) exchange, the emphasis should be placed on the broadness of the representatives participating in the exchange within the region, which is conducive to the direct entry of industrial products into the countryside, and at the same time, it can enable the state's policy and guidelines on materials exchange to quickly meet with the representatives of the primary market, which is beneficial. It is also important to invite representatives from other regions to participate in the exchange, but they should be invited purposefully, that is, they must put forward reasonable purchase and sale plans according to the situation that the region needs to purchase or sell those goods to that region, and notify the other party to invite them. Only in this way can the different needs of various places be comprehensively and focusedly resolved through purposeful and planned exchanges. Because from the perspective of a province or region, there must be some goods that need to be sold or purchased to other regions, and the various places are not completely the same.
    Third, in the transaction, private merchants should mainly use their own funds and spot transactions. For certain non-branded industrial products, handicrafts, and a few small local specialties that are suitable for the needs of the masses but have not yet opened up fixed sales channels, bank loans can be appropriately combined and futures transactions can be carried out in a realistic manner. There are currently two situations that should be paid attention to: one is that some private industrialists and businessmen still have the mentality of relying on state bank loans and do not actively use their own funds. The other situation is that some merchants simply rush to buy famous brands and are unwilling to promote certain miscellaneous brands of industrial products and handicrafts. They do not realize that with the arrival of the autumn harvest peak season, many non-branded industrial products and handicrafts with good quality and low prices are suitable for the needs of the vast rural market. We should first correct the private merchants' thinking of relying on loans and pursuing "famous brands." At the same time, we should actively and realistically organize transactions for those commodities that are suitable for the consumption needs of the masses but have not yet opened up fixed sales channels. If private merchants have indeed difficulties in funds, appropriate loans can be considered to promote their transactions in order to help open up the sales channels of these commodities. Generally, handicraftsmen have relatively short funds and few spot goods. Therefore, for certain handicrafts, in addition to spot goods, futures transactions can also be appropriately organized to enable them to carry out production in a more planned way to meet the needs of the rural market.
    Fourth, we must grasp the comprehensive combination of small-amount free transactions and large-volume organized transactions. Since private merchants in the primary market widely participate in the exchange, and they mainly use their own funds and spot transactions, we must pay attention to the transaction methods with many transactions, small amounts, quick turnover, and constant flow. In the Southern Jiangsu and Zhejiang exchange conferences, one transaction was as low as 100,000 or 200,000 yuan (such a small amount is of course not many), and the average transaction was about 6 million or 7 million yuan, which is completely in line with the operating capacity of private merchants in general small towns. Therefore, we should not feel troubled because of the small amount and many transactions, and we should pay attention to and encourage them. For those private merchants who honestly and actively operate and do not blindly compete for "famous brands," their requests for loans or relaxation of exchange when they have fully used their own funds should be considered. Because this can enable more industrial products to enter the countryside, preparing better conditions for the materials exchange in the vast rural primary market. On the other hand, we must also grasp the reasonable production and sales relationship according to the established exchange plan, invite representatives from relevant regions with preparation and planning, organize professional commodity seminars to carry out large-amount collective transactions, and combine them with bank loans; however, we should strictly criticize certain private merchants' thinking and behavior of competing for famous brand commodities, blindly exaggerating purchase and sale plans, not fully using their own funds, and relying on large amounts of bank loans, and should not make any concessions or accommodations.
    Fifth, the main task of the peak season exchange is to promote industrial products (including handicrafts) to the countryside (in areas with more small local specialties and the peak season for production and sales, promoting local specialties should be equally important at the same time). Therefore, the focus of the peak season exchange should be on the primary market, and the exchange in the intermediate market is mainly to prepare for the entry of industrial products into the countryside (or the purchase of local products). Although the purchasing power of the rural areas after the autumn harvest has increased due to the large number of major agricultural products on the market, most small local specialties are not yet in the peak season for production, which stipulates that the main task of the autumn exchange is the entry of industrial products and handicrafts (mainly local) into the countryside. Therefore, it is completely correct to focus the organization and promotion of materials exchange on the primary market close to the purchasing power of the rural areas. Regardless of whether or not exchange conferences in the intermediate market have been held in various places, they should concentrate their efforts on the research and preparation of the production and sales situation in the primary market: specifically, conduct commodity ranking, clarify the purpose of the exchange according to the reasonable production and sales relationship, and formulate practical exchange plans. We should take farmers as the main target, invite representatives from neighboring areas to participate in the transaction according to their needs, focusing on retail, combined with small-amount wholesale and local product purchase. We oppose the practice of being clueless, blindly exaggerating, simply pursuing transaction figures, and not realistically solving problems. In the primary market exchange conference, trade, cooperation, banking, taxation, and transportation departments must closely cooperate and act in unison under the unified leadership of the local party committee and government. State-owned trade and cooperatives must play a leading role in the market through their own purchase and sale activities (including wholesale and retail) in accordance with the plan. At present, in some areas, the practice of prohibiting state-owned trading companies from participating in primary market exchanges, or stipulating that state-owned trading companies only do wholesale and not retail, or unilaterally stipulating that the exchange ratio is two public and eight private, or ordering state-owned trading companies and cooperatives to accept unsold goods and try to supply hot-selling famous brand goods is incorrect. In order to gain experience in the autumn primary market exchange conference, various localities can strengthen their efforts, create typical examples, gain experience, and grasp the laws under the leadership of higher-level party and government organs, and then universally unfold them according to different regions and different commodity production and sales situations.
    East China has initially gained some experience after the local product exchange conference last year and the urban-rural materials exchange conferences at all levels that were universally held this summer. However, we still lack relatively mature experience in organizing materials exchange during the autumn harvest peak season. We must specifically study the new characteristics of the autumn exchange, determine new guidelines and methods, and cannot mechanically apply the existing experience to lead the autumn harvest peak season exchange. We believe that after the universal development of materials exchange conferences at all levels (especially the primary market) in the autumn and winter this year, the organization and planning of material circulation in the markets at all levels will be further strengthened, some of the existing production and sales contradictions will be appropriately resolved, and greater development of industrial and agricultural production will be promoted, enlivening the urban and rural economy and serving the large-scale national economic construction that is about to come.

    华东区秋冬旺季物资交流中的几个问题
    华东军政委员会贸易部副部长　杨浩庐
    华东区在开展城乡物资交流工作中得到的重要经验之一，是召开各级城乡物资交流会。它可以根据各地物资的产销关系，有计划地来组织物资交流，以支持生产和改进生产，使产销能逐步实现计划性，克服盲目性。今年夏季华东区城乡物资交流大会闭幕后，华东全区各级市场先后举行了三百多次物资交流会，购销总额达九万六千亿元，进一步把物资交流深入到县以下的初级市场，大大改善了广大农村的经济生活，使城市工业生产扩展了更广泛的市场，并且教育了我们广大的干部，批判了重视生产忽视交流的片面观点，也提高了许多私营工商业者对人民政府政策的正确认识和生产经营的积极性，这就为迎接秋收旺季的市场繁荣打下了基础。
    今年华东各省除部分地区受到一些灾害因而减产外，总的来说，获得了比去年更好的丰收，广大农村购买力无疑地将进一步提高。自七月份以来，大多数城市的营业情况都比去年同期为好；进入九月，凡秋季作物已登场的地区，特别是接近农村的县镇初级市场，已呈现普遍活跃。浙江省与苏南区在九月底与十月初先后举行了秋季城乡交流大会，参加大会交流的私营工商业人数之多，交易笔数之多都是空前的。参加浙江交流大会的代表和交易人员有七千五百人，参加苏南交流大会的代表和交易人员也近七千人，两地交易的次数都达到一万七、八千起。百分之九十左右的代表或参加交流的私商都是县和县以下初级市场的私营工商业者，这是秋冬旺季物资交流和夏季物资交流不同的特点。这些来自农村市镇的私营工商业者之所以这样踊跃地参加省区中级市场的物资交流大会，一方面是由于私商已从夏季物资交流中体会了人民政府的政策，认清了他们的前途，因此已普遍地积极起来；另一方面则是看到了秋季丰收后农村购买力已经在市场上出现。参加浙江或苏南的交流大会的初级市场的商人，其中很多人在不到半个月的会期中，曾经两次来往交易，在开始交流时即办货回去，很快销完后又赶到大会交流。我们不仅可以从这里看出初级市场私营工商业者的经营积极性，而且可以说明今年秋冬市场繁荣已经到来。所有从事国营商业、合作社商业的工作人员和私营工商业者，都必须充分注意这一情况，并在国家计划和国营经济领导下，为搞好秋季物资交流积极行动起来。
    秋冬旺季的城乡物资交流工作，很显明地与夏季物资交流具有不同情况和新的特点：农产丰收，同时在国家合理的价格政策支持之下，农村购买力将大大提高；国营贸易公司在今年上半年生产淡季，为支持城市工业生产，积蓄供应力量，进行了巨额的加工订货，掌握了大量的工业品，可有计划地供应农民和市场的需要，但还有很多季节性产销和分散在各地生产的工业品与手工业品，还须有计划地来组织交流；秋收主要农作物，如粮、棉、烟、麻、茶都由国家通过合作社大量收购，而一般小土特产则应鼓励私商积极经营；国营贸易公司与合作社经过了“三反”“五反”运动和夏季物资交流，逐步端正了政策，并加强了对市场的领导力量；私营工商业者经过“五反”运动和夏季物资交流，正不断发挥其自力经营的积极性，但有些人在经营上还表现有相当的盲目性，在资金上还表现有依赖性。根据这些新的情况和特点，在组织秋收旺季物资交流工作时，应该注意掌握以下问题。
    第一、必须加强各级交流大会的计划性，克服盲目性。物资交流大会的目的，是有计划地促进商业活动、推动物资的正常流转，以调剂产销，和促进生产的正常发展，使市场成为较有组织有领导的市场。目前商品流转的情况，从不同商品来看，大宗的主要农产品和机制工业品由于国营经济和合作社的大量掌握与经营，已有较强的计划性；分散的小宗土特产和一般手工业品，虽然大多数已有销路，但在产销上还存在着较多的盲目性。从不同的市场来看，由于城市比较集中，农村极其分散，因而农村商品产销的盲目性就更大。各种工业品、手工业品和小土特产除部分因盲目生产或不适合群众需要因而没有发展前途者外，其余都有其合理的产销关系。各级物资交流大会应在事先弄清各地商品（包括土特产、工业品与手工业品）的基本产销情况，找出商品合理的产销关系，分别确定那些商品放到初级市场（一定地区范围），那些放到中级市场或高级市场交流大会去解决，分别订出切合实际的交流计划，以便有目的有计划地组织交流。通过这样广泛的而又是有目的的各级交流大会，就可能有计划地推动物资的正常流转，使盲目的市场成为较有组织有领导的市场，合理地解决产销矛盾和促进生产的正常发展。但须注意掌握：凡属国家普遍收购或通过合作社收购的主要农产品，计划供应的主要工业品，从各方面都证明是盲目生产或粗制滥造、不适合群众需要、无发展前途的少数次要物资，都不应作为交流重点。因为前者已由国家有计划地掌握购销，后者则应在生产方面加以改进和改组，如再作为重点组织交流，反而打乱了购销计划，破坏物资的合理流转和影响生产的正常发展，同时也浪费了组织领导各级物资交流大会的力量，使我们不能很好地集中力量掌握必需解决而且可以解决的问题。
    第二、应该根据每一个交流会的具体目的和交流计划，广泛动员本区初级市场的私商参加，和有目的地邀请外区代表参加交流。此次浙江省和苏南区的交流大会，广泛动员了本区小城镇的商人代表参加，这是完全正确的，各小市镇私商的踊跃参加交流，也是完全正常的。因为秋收旺季交流已不同于夏季（淡季）交流，在本区范围内应着重参加交流的代表的广泛性，这样有助于工业品的直接下乡，同时能使国家对物资交流的政策方针迅速与初级市场的代表见面，是有好处的。邀请外区代表参加交流也很重要，但应有目的地邀请，即必须按照本区有那些商品需要向那个地区购买或推销的情况，分别提出合理的购销计划，通知对方进行邀请。这样才能通过有目的有计划的交流，全面而又有重点地解决各地不同需要的问题。因为从一个省区范围来看，必定是有些商品需要向外区推销或购买的，而且各地又是不完全相同的。
    第三、在交易上应以私商自有资金和现货交易为主，对于适合群众需要而又尚未打开固定销路的某些非名牌工业品、手工业品和少数小土特产，可适当结合银行贷款，实事求是地进行期货交易。目前有两种情况应予注意：一种是某些私营工商业者还有依赖国家银行贷款的心理，不积极运用自有资金。另一种情况是有些商人单纯抢购名牌货，而不愿推销某些杂牌工业品和手工业品。他们没有认识秋收旺季到来，很多物美价廉的非名牌工业品和手工业品，倒是适合广大农村市场需要的。我们应当首先纠正私商依靠贷款和追求“名牌”货的思想，同时对于那些适合群众消费需要、但尚未打开固定销路的商品，应以积极的态度，实事求是地组织成交。私商资金如确有困难，可考虑予以适当贷款促其成交，以便协助打开这些商品的销路。一般手工业者资金均较短绌，现货不多，因此，对于某些手工业品，除现货外，还可适当组织期货交易，使能较有计划地进行生产，以满足农村市场的需要。
    第四、必须掌握小额自由交易和大宗组织成交的全面结合的交易方式，由于初级市场私商广泛地参加交流，又是以自有资金和现货交易为主，因此，就必须重视笔数多金额小、速去速来、川流不息的交易办法。苏南和浙江交流大会中有一笔交易少至十万二十万元的（这样小额当然不多），平均每笔交易约六、七百万元，这是完全和一般小城镇私商的经营能力符合的。因此，我们不要因其金额小笔数多感觉麻烦，应该予以重视和鼓励。对那些老老实实积极经营，不是盲目竞争“名牌”货的私商，在其充分运用自有资金之后请求贷款或放宽押汇时，应该予以考虑。因为这样能使工业品更多地下乡，为广大农村初级市场的物资交流准备了更好的条件。另一方面，还须按照所订的交流计划，掌握合理的产销关系，有准备有计划地邀请有关地区代表，组织专业商品座谈会进行大额集体成交，并与银行贷款结合起来；但对于某些私商的竞争名牌商品、盲目夸大购销计划、不充分运用自有资金、依赖银行大量贷款的思想与行为，则应给以严格的批判，不能丝毫加以迁就和照顾。
    第五、旺季交流的主要任务是推动工业品（包括手工业品）下乡（在小土特产较多而又是产销旺季的地区，推销土特产应同时并重），因此旺季交流的重点，应该是初级市场，而中级市场的交流，主要是为工业品下乡（或土产收购）做好准备。秋收后农村的购买力虽然由于各种主要农产品大量上市而增加了，但多数小土特产则尚非旺产季节，这就规定了秋季交流的主要任务是工业品和手工业品
    （以当地为主）的下乡。也因此而把组织和推动物资交流的重点放到接近农村购买力的初级市场，这是完全正确的。各地不论是否开过了中级市场的交流大会，都应以极大力量集中于初级市场产销情况的研究和准备工作：具体进行商品排队，按照合理的产销关系明确交流的目的，订出切实可行的交流计划。应以农民为主要对象，根据需要邀请邻区代表参加交易，以零售为主，结合小额批发和土产收购。我们反对那种心中无数，盲目夸大，单纯追求成交数字，不切实解决问题的作法。在初级市场交流大会中，贸易、合作、银行、税收和运输等部门必须在当地党委和政府的统一领导下，密切配合。行动一致。国营贸易、合作社必须按照计划，通过自己的购销活动（包括批发与零售），发挥对市场的领导作用。目前在某些地区禁止国营贸易公司参加初级市场交流，或规定国营贸易公司只做批发不做零售，或片面规定交流比重为公二私八，或命令国营贸易公司、合作社收进滞销货，尽量供给热销名牌货等作法，都是不正确的。为了取得秋季初级市场交流大会的经验，各地可在上级党政机关领导下，按不同地区和不同的商品产销情况，加强力量，创造典型，取得经验，掌握规律，再行普遍展开。
    华东各地先后经过了去年土产交流会和今年夏季普遍召开的各级城乡物资交流会，已初步取得了若干经验。但组织秋收旺季的物资交流，我们还缺乏比较成熟的经验。我们必须具体研究秋季交流新的特点，确定新的方针与方法，不能机械运用已有的经验来领导秋收旺季的交流。我们相信，今年秋冬各级市场（尤其是初级市场）在普遍展开物资交流大会后，一定会进一步加强各级市场物资流转的组织性和计划性，适当解决目前还存在着的某些产销矛盾，促进工农业生产的更大发展，活跃城乡经济，为即将到来的大规模的国家经济建设服务。
