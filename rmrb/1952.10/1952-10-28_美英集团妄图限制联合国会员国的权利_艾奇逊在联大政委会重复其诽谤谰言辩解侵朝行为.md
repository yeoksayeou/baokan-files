Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: TASS, New York—The United Nations General Assembly held plenary sessions on October 23rd and 24th to discuss the report by Trygve Lie on the so-called "Measures to Limit the Duration of Regular Sessions of the General Assembly." This report grants the President of the General Assembly broad powers to limit the speeches of representatives and recommends the establishment of so-called "special committees" to exercise powers between two successive sessions of the United Nations General Assembly.

From Lie's report and the speeches of the US-British bloc representatives at the meeting, it can be seen that the real drafter of this report, the US government, is trying, under the guise of shortening the duration of the General Assembly, to further turn the General Assembly into a machine that mechanically passes proposals and recommendations agreed upon by the United States, and restricts free discussion of issues of paramount importance to the maintenance of peace and international security.

At the meeting on the 23rd, the representatives of the United States and Britain spoke of the need to shorten the session of the General Assembly and demanded that the representatives adopt Lie's report and change the rules of procedure of the General Assembly.

Representatives from Uruguay and India spoke in rebuttal to the US and British representatives. The Uruguayan representative, Fabregat, opposed amending the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. He particularly emphasized that the purpose of the measures stipulated in the report is to give the President of the General Assembly "unlimited power," allowing him to act arbitrarily at meetings and depriving the delegation of independent countries of their democratic rights. The Dutch representative also opposed the establishment of so-called special committees, pointing out that this committee "may infringe upon the powers of the General Assembly."

The Indian representative stressed that modifying the rules of procedure as suggested may curtail the rights of representatives at the General Assembly meetings. He suggested that the President of the General Assembly appoint a special committee of experts to study the report.

On the morning of October 24th, the UN General Assembly plenary session continued to discuss Lie's report. The Guatemalan representative, Toriello, sharply warned that some of the recommendations in the report would restrict the freedom of thought and expression of member states. He suggested that the Legal Committee carefully study these aspects of the report.

The Czechoslovak representative, Nosek, pointed out that many of the suggestions in this report violate the true interests of the United Nations and are unacceptable. The Syrian representative also said in his speech that many of the suggestions in the report were obviously "dangerous."

The Soviet representative, Zorin, said that this report and many of its suggestions clearly infringe upon the spirit of the UN Charter and the rights of member states. He said that the suggestion to establish so-called special committees to work during the recess of the General Assembly is nothing more than a revival of a new form of the "Little Assembly," which violated the Charter in the past. Therefore, this report is absolutely unacceptable, and the Soviet delegation opposes submitting this report to any of the main committees of the General Assembly.

The Polish representative, Lachs, and the Ukrainian representative, Baranov, strongly supported the Soviet attitude.

Finally, the General Assembly voted 42 to pass the report to the Legal Committee for study and then submit it to the General Assembly. The Soviet Union and four other delegations voted against it, and one delegation abstained. The plenary session then adjourned.

Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: TASS, New York—The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly is currently reviewing the "Report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea." US Secretary of State Acheson delivered a nearly three-hour speech at the committee's meeting on the 24th.

Acheson's speech, like his speech at the plenary session on October 16th, revealed the US ruling clique's anxiousness about the fact that world public opinion no longer believes the lies of US propaganda and is increasingly firmly condemning US intervention in Korea and demanding an end to the Korean War.

At the beginning of his speech, Acheson put forward a much-publicized promise to make a comprehensive review of the Korean issue. He also said that he would speak according to the facts.

However, in fact, the US Secretary of State only repeated the old slanders of US propaganda against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Soviet Union in his speech. He tried his best to whitewash the US government's guilt in launching the Korean War and justify the US's continued aggression against Korea. Due to a lack of facts, Acheson repeatedly mentioned the confessions of traitors and various reports compiled under the instigation of the so-called "United Nations Commission on Korea" to make up for it.

His speech was full of fabrications, attempting to distort facts known to the world. Acheson quoted the Bible and hypocritically expressed his sympathy for the victims of the Korean War, attempting to portray the US's bloody intervention in Korea as "defense."

The first part of Acheson's speech was to fabricate the course of the Korean issue, attempting to prove that the division of Korea and the failure to realize the Korean people's desire for unification were not the fault of the US government. He tried his best to praise the Syngman Rhee puppet regime established by the US occupiers in South Korea.

In order to cover up the occupation system established by the United States in South Korea to turn South Korea into its colony, Acheson greatly vilified the people's democratic system established by the working people of North Korea. In order to achieve this goal, he rehashed the boring old tune out of thin air, insisting that this system... was established by the "Soviet army." But at the same time, Acheson had to admit that the Soviet army had withdrawn from Korea as early as December 25, 1948.

The Soviet delegation and the representative of the People's Republic of China presented many facts and documents at the Fifth and Sixth General Assemblies of the United Nations, which conclusively proved that it was the United States and its South Korean puppets who attacked the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Acheson dared not deny any of these facts and documents.

A large part of Acheson's speech was to cite the illegal resolutions on the Korean issue that the United States forced the General Assembly and the Security Council to pass in order to try to use the flag of the United Nations to cover up its aggression against Korea.

When talking about the military results of the US aggression against Korea, Acheson could not say what the results were, and actually admitted that the US war gamble in Korea had fallen into a dilemma. Acheson disregarded the facts and insisted that the attitude of the United Nations Command was to continue to limit the war in Korea.

When talking about the process of the Korean armistice negotiations, Acheson tried to shirk the responsibility for delaying and sabotaging the armistice negotiations. He adopted various evasive measures, attempting to prove that the Korean negotiations could not be successfully concluded because of the obstinate attitude of the representatives of the Korean-Chinese Command.

When talking about the issue of prisoners of war, which the US government used to interrupt the Korean peace talks, Acheson hypocritically assured the committee representatives that the US military command did not want to detain a single prisoner of war. Acheson shamelessly said that the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war had full freedom of choice on the repatriation issue, but at the same time he had to admit that the US military command was conducting screening of prisoners of war, or as he said, interrogating prisoners of war, and using troops to suppress communist riots in US prisoner of war camps.

The US Secretary of State admitted that the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War stipulated that prisoners of war should be released and repatriated, but he used various lawyer's tricks to whitewash the US government's refusal to repatriate Korean prisoners of war.

Acheson did not answer the proposal for the repatriation of prisoners of war put forward by the command of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on October 8 this year. He insisted that these proposals were unclear and contained nothing new. He simply slandered that the purpose of these proposals was to deceive the US government and its military command stationed in Korea.

Acheson cited many international agreements on the repatriation of prisoners of war, but these agreements had nothing to do with the US government's refusal to repatriate Korean-Chinese prisoners of war to their home countries. He attempted to prove that the US's attitude on the issue of exchanging prisoners of war did not violate the so-called "international practice." He insisted that this "practice" allowed the refusal to repatriate prisoners of war and did not stipulate that the belligerent parties had an obligation to repatriate all prisoners of war to their home countries.

The US Secretary of State put forward a proposal at the end of his speech, which was basically to have the General Assembly approve the methods and attitudes of the US military command in handling the Korean armistice negotiations, and to demand that the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea agree to the conditions for the repatriation of prisoners of war proposed by the United States.

    美英集团妄图限制联合国会员国的权利
    艾奇逊在联大政委会重复其诽谤谰言辩解侵朝行为
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会于十月二十三、二十四两日举行全体会议，讨论赖伊提出的所谓“限制大会例会期限的措施”的报告，这个报告给予大会主席限制代表发言的广泛权力，并建议设立一些所谓“特别委员会”在联合国前后两届大会之间行使职权。
    从赖伊的报告和美英集团代表在会议上的发言可以看出：这个报告的真正起草者美国政府，正力图在缩短大会期限的幌子下更进一步把大会变成一架机器，机械地通过美国所同意的提案和建议，限制对维护和平与国际安全具有头等重要意义的问题的自由讨论。
    在二十三日的会议上，美国和英国代表发言说有缩短大会会期的必要，并要求代表们通过赖伊的报告，改变大会的程序规则。
    乌拉圭和印度代表发言反驳美国和英国代表。乌拉圭代表法百莱格反对修正大会的程序规则。他特别着重指出，报告中所规定的措施的目的，在于给大会主席以“无限权力”，容许他在会议上专横行事，而剥夺独立国家的代表团的民主权利。荷兰代表也反对成立所谓特别委员会，他指出这个委员会“可能侵犯大会的权限。”
    印度代表强调说，按照建议修改议事规则，可能削减代表们在大会会议上的权利。他建议由大会主席任命一个专家组成的特殊委员会来研究这个报告。
    十月二十四日上午，联合国大会全体会议继续讨论赖伊的报告，危地马拉代表陶里欧尖锐地警告说，报告中的一些建议会限制会员国的思想与表示意见的自由，他建议由法律委员会慎重地研究报告中的这些方面。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表诺西克指出：这个报告里的许多建议，违背联合国的真正利益，是令人不能接受的。叙利亚代表在发言时也说这个报告里的许多建议显然都是“危险的”。
    苏联代表佐林发言说：这个报告和其中的许多建议，明显地侵犯了联合国宪章的精神与会员国的权利。他说，设立所谓特别委员会以在大会休会期进行工作的建议，无非是过去违反宪章的“小型联大”的一种新方式的复活，因而这个报告是绝对不能接受的，苏联代表团反对把这个报告提交大会的任何一个主要委员会。
    波兰代表拉赫斯和乌克兰代表巴拉诺夫斯基极力支持苏联的态度。
    最后大会以四十二票通过把这个报告送交法律委员会研究，然后提交大会。苏联和四个其它代表团投反对票，一个代表团弃权。全体会议至此休会。
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会目前正在审查“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告”，美国国务卿艾奇逊在委员会二十四日会议上作了近三小时的发言。
    艾奇逊这次发言与他在十月十六日全体会议上的发言一样，透露了美国统治集团对于世界舆论不再相信美国宣传的谎话而且愈来愈坚决地谴责美国干涉朝鲜并要求结束朝鲜战争这些事实所感到的焦急不安的心情。
    艾奇逊在发言之初就提出一项大事宣传过的诺言，说要对朝鲜问题作全盘的检查。他还说，他要根据事实说话。
    但是，实际上美国国务卿在发言中只是重复了美国宣传里对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与苏联的陈旧的诽谤谰言。他竭力企图洗刷美国政府发动朝鲜战争的罪责，辩解美国继续侵略朝鲜的行为。由于缺乏事实，因此艾奇逊一再提到叛徒的供词及所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”在美国授意下编制的各种报告来加以弥补。
    他的发言极尽其捏造之能事，企图歪曲举世皆知的事实。艾奇逊引证圣经并假惺惺地说他对朝鲜战争中的受难者表示同情，而企图把美国对朝鲜的血腥干涉说成是“防御”。
    艾奇逊演说的第一部分是伪造朝鲜问题的经过，企图证明朝鲜陷于分裂与朝鲜人民要求统一的愿望不能实现，罪过不在美国政府。他竭力替美国占领者在南朝鲜建立的李承晚傀儡政权吹嘘。
    为了掩饰美国为了把南朝鲜变成它的殖民地而在南朝鲜建立的占领制度，艾奇逊就对北朝鲜劳动人民建立的人民民主制度大事侮蔑。为了达到这种目的，他就无中生有地重弹令人厌烦的老调，硬说这个制度……是“苏联军队”建立的。但同时，艾奇逊也不得不承认苏联军队早在一九四八年十二月二十五日就撤出了朝鲜。
    苏联代表团和中华人民共和国代表在联合国第五届和第六届大会上提出了许多事实和文件，确凿地证明是美国及其南朝鲜傀儡进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，对于这些事实及文件，艾奇逊一个也不敢加以否认。
    艾奇逊的演说，有很大部分是引证美国为了要想用联合国的旗帜来掩饰它对朝鲜的侵略而强迫大会和安全理事会通过的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议。
    在谈到美国侵略朝鲜的军事结果时，艾奇逊讲不出有什么结果来，实际上是承认了美国在朝鲜的战争赌博已陷于进退维谷之境。艾奇逊不顾事实地硬说联合国军司令部的态度是要继续限制朝鲜的战争。
    在谈到朝鲜停战谈判的过程时，艾奇逊企图为美国推脱拖延和破坏停战谈判的责任。他采取了各种规避手段，企图证明朝鲜谈判是因为朝中司令部代表顽固态度的阻挠而不能顺利结束。
    在谈到美国政府用来中断朝鲜和平谈判的遣俘问题时，艾奇逊假惺惺地向委员会代表们提出保证，说美军司令部并不想扣留一个战俘。艾奇逊无耻地说，朝中战俘在遣返问题上都有充分的选择自由，但同时他又不得不承认，美军司令部正在对战俘进行甄别，或者如他所说对战俘进行询问，并利用军队来镇压美国战俘营中的共产党骚乱。
    这位美国国务卿承认一九四九年的日内瓦战俘公约中规定要释放并遣返战俘，但他又使用各种讼师诡计，来替拒绝遣返朝鲜战俘的美国政府洗刷。
    艾奇逊根本没有答复朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部在今年十月八日提出的遣俘建议。他硬说这些建议含意不清楚，而且没有新的东西。他只是诽谤说，这些建议的目的是哄骗美国政府及其驻在朝鲜的军事司令部。
    艾奇逊援引了许多关于遣返战俘的国际协定，不过，这些协定与美国政府拒绝遣返朝中战俘回国一事根本毫不相干。他企图证明美国在交换战俘问题上的态度并不违反所谓“国际惯例”，他硬说这种
    “惯例”准许拒绝遣返战俘，并且没有规定交战各方有遣返所有战俘回国的义务。
    美国国务卿在演说结束时提出一个提案，这个提案基本上就是要大会批准美军司令部处理朝鲜停战谈判的方法和态度，并要求中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府同意美国提出的遣返战俘的条件。
