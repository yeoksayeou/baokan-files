    The Japanese delegation would like to express its heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people, the conveners of this conference.
    At the same time, we express our sincere gratitude to the delegations from Asian, Pacific, Middle Eastern, and Near Eastern countries attending the conference, and to the gentlemen from all over the world for their profound friendship. The Japanese people are deeply concerned about this Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. For the International Economic Conference held in Moscow this March, Japan selected twenty-one representatives; when invited by China to participate in the Beijing "May Day" celebrations, one hundred and two representatives were selected. In order to participate in this conference, although the government obstructed us, in reality, preparatory committees were organized throughout the country, and four hundred and eighty-eight representative candidates were selected from all walks of life at mass meetings.
    These candidates included street chiefs, village chiefs, politicians, officials, Buddhist monks, Christian pastors, entrepreneurs, artists, writers, scholars, students, youth, women, farmers, workers, etc., selected from all over the country. This event also shows that the Japanese people have great concern and expectations for the peace conference held in Beijing.
    The Japanese people long for peace and free trade, but without independence, these two demands cannot be met. Today, the Japanese people's desire for peace is consistent with their desire for independence. Having tasted the criminal acts of the seven years of war of aggression and the suffering under the current occupation, the Japanese people truly and sincerely demand peace and independence from the bottom of their hearts.
    The San Francisco peace treaty not only bears the banner of peace and independence, but in reality, it is for the purpose of carrying out war and colonization. On this issue, we are convinced that this peace conference held in Beijing is a "genuine peace conference." Therefore, I advocate concluding a comprehensive peace treaty based on the spirit of resolving issues peacefully, to replace the San Francisco treaty.
    I sincerely congratulate the convening of this conference, and at the same time, I expect that the success of this conference will bring great contributions to the peace and happiness of mankind in the world. (Xinhua News Agency)

    日本代表团副团长南博的演词  （摘要）
    日本代表团，对这次会议的召开者中国人民，衷心表示感谢。
    同时，对出席会议的亚洲，太平洋各国及中东、近东的代表团和来自世界各国的先生们给予我们的深厚友谊，表示十分感谢。日本国民对这次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，怀着莫大的关心。今年三月为莫斯科召开的国际经济会议，日本选出了二十一名代表；应中国之请参加北京“五一”庆典时选出了一百零二名代表。为了参加这次会议，虽然政府对我们进行阻挠，但实际上，全国各地都组织了筹备委员会在群众大会上从各阶层选出了四百八十八名代表候选人。
    这些候选人中包括从全国各地选出来的街长、村长、政治家、官吏、佛教的僧侣、基督教的牧师、实业家、艺术家、文学家、学者、学生、青年、妇女、农民、工人等等。这一事件也说明日本国民对于在北京召开的和平会议是抱着莫大的关心和期待的。
    日本国民渴望着和平与自由贸易，但是得不到独立的话，这两个要求就达不到。今天日本国民要求和平的愿望是和要求独立的愿望是一致的。日本国民因为尝受了七年的侵略战争的犯罪行为和现在占领下的苦处，所以是真正从心底里要求和平与独立的。
    旧金山的和约会议，不但挂着和平与独立的招牌，而实际上是为了进行战争和殖民地化。对这个问题，我们确信这次在北京召开的和平会议是“真正的和平会议”。因之我主张根据以和平方式解决问题的精神缔结全面和约，来代替旧金山和约。
    我衷心祝贺这个会议的召开，同时，我期待着这个会议的成功将对世界人类的和平与幸福带来莫大的贡献。（新华社）
