Mr. Chairman, Ladies, Gentlemen, Delegates!

I am very happy to be able to extend my sincere respects to you today on behalf of the National Council of the Peace Movement of my motherland, France, which is to say, the respects of the millions of French people who are actually participating in the peace movement.

On this point, I would like to make it clear: the number of French people participating in the movement to strive for peace is, to date, less than half of the total population of France, but we can say with certainty that, as in countries around the world, the vast majority of our French people demand peace; and we believe, without vanity, that through the various demonstrations we have organized in France for the upcoming World People's Peace Congress, the various efforts we will complete, can enable us to reach, and even exceed, fifty percent of the population. That is to say, we can obtain the open support of the majority of French citizens.

I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to the organizers of this Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference for their warm hospitality to us; I thank the Preparatory Committee of this conference, the Secretary-General of the committee, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chairman of the committee, the citizens of Beijing, the entire Chinese people and their government, and their leader Chairman Mao Zedong!

I will never forget the moving scene of welcome when we got off the plane. That child with bright eyes, a smiling face, and so lovely. He presented me with flowers and affectionately took my hand. This child was for me a vivid symbol of the thriving new China, which is forging ahead vigorously and proudly to strive for a beautiful and progressive life.

I would also like to express special thanks to those who prepared this conference, for completing this great achievement from which we benefit so greatly. In this undoubtedly unique environment, they have been able to assemble all the most favorable conditions, obtaining the delegates' tireless efforts and fruitful work. This work should ensure the complete success of the conference, and in
the lands of this part of the world, promote an irresistible atmosphere for our common struggle. We hope that in the short term, peace will definitely triumph over war.

I would immediately like to state that the vast majority of men and women in Western countries, like you, and with the same determination as you, want to stop the slaughter taking place in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya as quickly as possible, to stop the large-scale massacres and the scourge of war.

Peace is the business of all those who are aware of human dignity, the business of all nations that demand respect for national self-determination. Peace is indivisible; this is the condition of its strength, its universality, and its permanence.

It is particularly important that the countries of the Asian and Pacific region handle their own extremely important problems, because only they can find the appropriate and urgent solutions to these problems.

But at the same time, your actions must be supported by our actions. Let those few war-mongers who want to subject all countries in the world to their will encounter the same unwavering will, in every country, everywhere, demanding a peaceful life. Moreover, they will equally encounter the will to thoroughly stop the violation of all peoples, to demand the sacred right of self-determination, and the right to organize their own countries and live according to their own wishes.

These few war-mongers are small in number, but under the leadership of the American rulers, they possess some tools that we should neither overestimate nor underestimate: they have money, which is a tool to corrupt and alienate people; they have newspapers and radio broadcasts, working hard to spread lies and slander; they have the most destructive, most lethal, and most brutal weapons.

The intention of the American rulers, without any discount, is to dominate the world. James Burnham, an advisor to Truman, in his book entitled "How to Rule the World," among many outrageous sentences, states definitively that the United States must use war, or the threat of war, to achieve the goal of ruling the world.

Some of these crazy words can be explained by the fact that the United States suffered very little loss in the two world wars. Only the United States seized world markets, monopolized raw materials, and made huge profits in the two world wars. Only the rulers of the United States would have this delusion, thinking that they have gold coins and a large number of weapons, and that they can still benefit from war.

But they have forgotten that what plays a role in war is not just gold coins and weapons, but also people, people who work for an ideal, for the sacred cause of defending national independence and the motherland. They have forgotten the brilliant lesson given by the new China and its entire people. They have forgotten the lessons given daily by the heroic Korean people and the brave Chinese People's Volunteers in their great sacrifices.

However, they have also found some accomplice rulers. They have found the French rulers, who this year received a sum of less than 300 billion francs, and were willing to give up national sovereignty, allowing the Americans to occupy French territory, destroy the French economy, and carry out the inhumane war in Vietnam, which cost France 600 billion francs in 1952 alone.

They have especially obtained the complicity of the current rulers of West Germany and Japan, the defeated nations in World War II. They have vigorously helped West Germany and Japan to revive industrial construction, re-arm, and militarize, and incite them to retaliate and re-engage in adventures to conquer others.

But the people of the world are aware of the crisis of another terrible war engulfing the world. They are also aware of their solidarity, their strength, and their rights to national independence, the lives of the people, and the peace they demand. They do not want foreign leadership, foreign pressure, nor any form of exploitation; they want to forge their own destiny in peace.

The time is approaching when the people of all countries will unite to force the realization of lasting peace, and to safeguard the national independence of all countries. The historic work being completed in this venue will greatly accelerate the arrival of this time.

But we have not reached that day yet. War and all its inhuman facts have fallen on some innocent people. Our French rulers are waging war in Vietnam under such circumstances.

I would just like to briefly point out here that this war is a heinous and shameful war for the vast majority of the French people. I stand with the French people, deeply saddened by the war in Vietnam. I stand with the French people, striving to stop this war with my actions, and with the right to speak in Congress. I would like to tell you that I have said what I am saying here more than once on the podium of the French Senate.

The war waged by the French authorities is an unjust war.

In 1946, I was the commander of the Paris military region. On July 14th, French National Day that year, the troops I commanded paraded in front of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and the French government then received Chairman Ho Chi Minh with the etiquette of a head of state. During the same period, I and other people friendly to Vietnam dined with Chairman Ho Chi Minh. Chairman Ho Chi Minh, who was proficient in French culture, expressed to us his friendship for the French people. I have said that he learned the republican motto from France: "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity." All he asked was to respect the spirit of this motto and honestly implement the agreement signed between France and Vietnam on March 6, 1946. Under that agreement, the French government recognized the independence of Vietnam under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh.

However, some powerful figures in the government opposed the independence of Vietnam under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh.

Soon after, the unfortunate Haiphong incident occurred. In November 1946, over a minor customs dispute, French troops bombarded Haiphong, killing thousands of unarmed Vietnamese people. Later, in December, dozens of French people were killed by Vietnamese people in Hanoi. Thus, the war broke out. In this inhumane war, my Vietnamese brothers died at the hands of my French brothers, and my French brothers lost their lives in large numbers in this country far from France. In this inhumane war, the French army destroyed this country everywhere, and the French government did not implement the promise it made to grant the Vietnamese people the right to independence in March 1946.

Because of the French army's implementation of terror policies in Vietnam, which resulted in bloodshed everywhere, the deep friendship between our two peoples has been broken since then. We feel very painful when we think about it.

Today, in front of us—in front of the Vietnamese delegation, I feel more clearly than ever the responsibility that falls on me, and also on all French people. We are suffering from the pain of war, and we feel ashamed because of this war. Because, we have neither been able to prevent this war from happening, nor have we been able to bring this war to an end.

Precisely because I love my country and I am willing to serve my people, precisely because I am a brother of the Vietnamese people, when I return to France, I will do everything in my power to end this cruel war as soon as possible, taking this as the most urgent task.

I will resolutely participate in the work of the peace movement, and we will awaken the consciousness of our compatriots to strive for peace in Vietnam, peace in Korea, and peace in the whole world.

In the eyes of some people, the French seem to be asleep. This is the obvious result of the division organized by foreigners and the French authorities, and it is also the result of the persecution of people who demand peace and the right to a healthy life of freedom.

However, please believe that in my country, we have not forgotten that the same blood as Joan of Arc flows in our veins—this daughter of the people, who resisted the enemy and drove them out of French territory. We cannot forget that we are the children of the revolutionaries of 1789 and the Communards of the Paris Commune of 1871.

If proof is needed, I can cite that during the Great War, under the enemy's occupation, regardless of the occupiers' terror, the French underground army spontaneously organized to fight for the honor of the motherland and national independence. In this resistance war, 70,000 unyielding soldiers heroically sacrificed themselves for the motherland, and without the resistance of the underground army, the Allied forces would not have succeeded in landing in Normandy.

Our country's peace movement, taking the opportunity of preparing for the upcoming World People's Peace Congress, is awakening everyone's consciousness. As for me, I will do my best. We believe that the comprehensive movement will quickly achieve a ceasefire in Vietnam, and at the same time will make an important contribution from France to the World People's Peace Congress.

France's actions in the struggle for peace are also a contribution to the overall struggle for peace in the world, and the convening and achievements of your magnificent conference will be a strong impetus, greatly helping the people of the world to jointly demand the new century of lasting peace.

### 法国全国和平理事会副主席  柏蒂将军在和平会议上的致词

    法国全国和平理事会副主席
    柏蒂将军在和平会议上的致词主席先生，女士们，先生们，代表们！
    我非常高兴，今天能够代表我的祖国——法兰西的和平运动全国理事会，向你们致以衷心的敬礼，这也就是实际参加和平运动的千百万法国人民的敬礼。
    关于这一点，我想说得明确些：法国人民参加争取和平运动的人数，到目前为止，还不到法国全国人口的半数，可是我们可以肯定地知道，正如在世界各国一样，我们法国人民的极大多数是要求和平的；并且我们毫不自负地想：通过我们在法国为了行将来到的世界人民和平大会而组织的各种示威行动，我们将要完成的各种努力，可以使我们达到、并且超过百分之五十的人数。也就是说，我们可以得到大多数法国公民们的公开赞助。
    我也愿意向这次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的组织者们致诚恳的谢意，感谢他们对于我们的热烈招待；我向这次会议的筹备委员会，向该委员会的秘书长，向中国人民保卫世界和平委员会，向该会的主席，向北京的市民，向全中国人民以及他们的政府，和他们的领袖毛泽东主席致谢！
    我永远不会忘记，当我们下飞机时，那种令人感动的接待情形。那个目光奕奕、满面笑容、十分可爱的儿童。他向我献花并亲热地用手牵着我。这孩子对于我是盛情的新中国的活生生的象征，新中国已经蓬蓬勃勃地和骄傲地向前迈进，以争取一个美丽的和进步的生活。
    我也愿意向筹备这次大会的人表示特别的谢意，感谢他们完成了这个我们身受其惠的伟大实现。在这一个无疑是唯一的环境里，他们能够集合一切最有利的条件，获得代表们始终不懈的努力及富于收获的工作。这个工作应该保证大会圆满成功，并在
    世界这一部分的土地上，发扬出我们的共同斗争的
    一种不可抗拒的气象。我们希望在短期内，和平必
    定战胜战争。
    我立刻要说明，西方各国的极大多数男女，和你们一样，并且和你们有一致的决心，要尽速制止在朝鲜、越南、马来亚进行着的残杀，制止大规模屠杀及战争灾祸。
    和平是所有这些觉悟到人类尊严的人的事情，是要求尊重民族自决权的所有民族的事情。和平是不可分割的；这是它的力量，它的普遍性，它的永久性的条件。
    让亚洲及太平洋区域的国家处理它们本身的、极端重要的问题，这是特别重要的，因为只有它们才可以找到这些问题应有的适当的和刻不容缓的解决方案。
    但同时也必须使你们的行动得到我们的行动的支持。使那些想把世界各国都听命于他们的一小撮的战争贩子，在各国、在到处都遇到要求和平生活的、同一的、不屈不挠的意志。此外他们也会同样遇到要彻底制止侵犯各国人民，要求神圣的自决权，以及由他们自己组织他们的国家，并且按照自己的意思去生活的权利的意志。
    这一小撮的战争贩子为数不多，但是在美国统治者的领导之下，他们却拥有一些我们不应该高估，也不应该低估的工具：他们有金钱，这是使人腐化以及离间的工具：他们有报纸，有无线电广播，在努力散布谎言和毁谤；他们有破坏性最大，杀伤性最高并且最为残酷的武器。
    美国统治者的意图，不折不扣，就是要独霸世界，杜鲁门的顾问詹姆斯·蓬汉姆在他所著的题为“如何统治世界”那本书里面，在许多令人发指的话句之间，有一段话肯定美国必须用战争，或用战争的威胁，来达到统治世界的目的。
    这种疯狂的话，有一部分可以用这件事实来说明它：就是在两次世界大战中，美国所受的损失很少。只有美国夺取世界市场、垄断原料，在两次世界大战中获得很大的利润，只有美国的统治者会作此妄想，以为他们有金圆和有大量的武器，他们还可以从战争得到好处。
    但是他们忘记了，在战争中起作用的不只是金圆和武器，还有人呢，还有为一种理想努力的人，为保卫民族独立和祖国的神圣事业的人。他们忘记了新中国和它全体人民所给予的辉煌的教训。他们忘记了在伟大牺牲中的英勇的朝鲜人民和勇敢的中国人民志愿军每天所给予的教训。
    不过，他们也找到了一些作帮凶的统治者。他们找到了法国的执政者，这些执政者今年拿到了一笔还不到三千亿法郎的款项，就甘愿断送国家主权，让美国人占领法国土地，摧残法国经济，并且进行惨无人道的越南战争，仅仅在一九五二年里，这场战争就花了法国六千亿法郎。
    他们特别是获得了二次大战中的战败者，西德和日本的目前执政者们的同谋，他们大力帮助西德和日本复兴工业建设，重整军备和军国主义化，并且嗾使他们进行报复和再作征服别人的冒险。
    但是世界人民意识到了波及全世界的再一次可怕的战争的危机。他们同时意识到他们的团结，他们的力量，以及他们对于民族独立、人民的生活和他们所要求的和平的权利。他们不愿意外来的领导，外来的压力，也不愿意任何形式的剥削；他愿意在和平中，自己来铸造自己的命运。
    各国人民互相团结起来迫使持久和平实现，以及维护各国的民族独立的时机，已经迫近了。正是在这个会场上完成着的历史性的工作，将大大地加速这个时机的到来。
    但是，现在我们还没有达到那一天。战争和它的一切惨无人道的事实已经落在一些无辜的人民的头上。我们法国的执政者们是在这种情况下在越南进行战争的。
    我在这儿只想简单地指出，这场战争对于极大多数的法国人民说是一场丑恶可耻的战争。我和法国人民在一起，对于越南战争深深地感觉痛心。我和法国人民在一起，努力用我的行动，用国会里的发言权，来制止这一战争。我愿意告诉诸位：我曾把这里所说的话不止一次在法国参议院的讲坛上讲过。
    法国的当政者所进行的战争是非正义的战争。
    一九四六年，我是巴黎军区的司令官。那一年的七月十四日法国国庆日，我所指挥的部队在胡志明主席面前列队游行，法国政府那时以一国元首的礼节招待胡志明主席。在同一时期，我和另一些和越南友善的人士跟胡志明主席一同用餐。精通法国文化的胡志明主席，向我们表示他对于法国人民的友谊。我曾说他从法国学到的共和国的箴言：“自由，平等，博爱”。他所要求的只是尊重这箴言的精神而诚实地执行一九四六年三月六日订立的法国与越南之间的协定。由于那一协定法国政府承认胡志明主席领导下的越南的独立。
    但是，一些政府中当权分子反对胡志明领导下的越南独立。
    不久之后，不幸的海防事件发生了。一九四六年十一月，为了一件海关上的小小的争执，法国军队炮轰海防，杀死了数千手无寸铁的越南人民。后来，在十二月，几十个法国人在河内被越南人杀死了。于是，战争就发生了。在这惨无人道的战争里，我的越南弟兄们死在我的法国弟兄的手里，而我的法国弟兄们又大量地丧身于这个距离法国辽远的国家。在这惨无人道的战争里，法国军队到处破坏这个国家，法国政府竟不实行它在一九四六年三月答应给与越南人民独立权的诺言。
    由于我们法国军队在越南实施恐怖政策，使得血流遍地，我们两国人民的深挚的友谊关系从此破裂了。我们想起来都感觉非常痛苦。
    今天，在我们面前——在越南代表团面前，我比任何时候都更清楚地感觉到落在我身上，同时也落在全体法国人身上的责任。我们受着战争的痛苦，我们因为这个战争而感到羞耻惭愧。因为，我们既没有能够阻止这场战争的发生，又没有能够使这场战争结束。
    正因为我爱我的国家而且我愿为我国人民服务，正因为我是越南人民的兄弟，当我回到法国的时候，我必将尽所有力量使这残酷的战争尽早结束，把这当作为一件最迫切的任务。
    我将坚决地参加和平运动的工作，我们将唤起我国同胞的觉醒，来争取越南的和平，朝鲜的和平，全世界的和平。
    在某些人的眼里看来，法国人好像在沉睡。这是外国人和法国的执政者所组织的分化的显明结果，同时也是对要求和平与自由健康生活权利的人们，施行迫害的结果。
    然而请你们相信在我的国家里，我们并没有忘记在我们的血管里流着和贞德同样的血——这位人民的女儿，她反抗敌人，把敌人驱逐出法国的国土。我们也不能忘记我们是一七八九年的革命者和一八七一年巴黎公社党人的儿女。
    假如需要证明的话，我可以举出在大战时，在敌人的占领下，不顾占领者的恐怖，法国的地下军自动地组织起来，为了祖国的荣誉与民族独立而斗争。在这个抗战中，没有制服的七万兵士为祖国英勇牺牲了，而且如果没有地下军的抗战，联军在诺曼底登陆就不会成功。
    我国和平运动，借着筹备即将召开世界人民和平大会的机会，唤醒大家的觉悟。至于我呢，我当用全力去做。我们相信全面的运动将很迅速地获得越南停战，同时将使得法国对于世界人民和平大会有重要的贡献。
    法国这种和平斗争行动对于全世界为和平的全面斗争也是有贡献的，而你们此次辉煌的会议的召开与成就将是一个坚强的推动力，大大地帮助了全世界人民共同要求建立持久和平的新世纪的愿望。
