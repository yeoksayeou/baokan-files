    The British Peace Movement
    Ivor Montagu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Peace Council
    In the same week that the people of Asia and the Pacific region were holding a grand conference, a grand demonstration was held in London with the slogans: "Trade with the Soviet Union and China! Stop colonial wars! Stop the wars in Korea and Malaya! Send the American bombers back! We want peace!"
    The British people love peace. The war-mongers have completely failed in their attempts to provoke hatred towards the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and China through intensive propaganda in newspapers, radio, and films. The propaganda of the war-mongers has only succeeded in spreading an atmosphere of confusion, making the British people unclear about the rights and wrongs of many issues, causing fear, and making many people tolerate war preparations and often distrust peace proposals from other countries. But no one wants war, and no one expects war. More and more people are escaping from the captivating web and arriving at the home of peace activities from different paths.
    Many annual conferences of trade unions and cooperative associations have passed resolutions criticizing the government's warmongering actions and demanding peace, or at least have often had a minority vote representing millions of people expressing support for peace. Workers have strongly protested the lowering of living standards and rising prices brought about by the arms program, and have held many strikes. The Trades Union Congress—the annual conference of national trade unions—despite the appeals of reactionary trade union leaders who demanded that the congress not "offend the United States," ultimately passed a resolution condemning bacteriological warfare. The Labour Party's annual conference received hundreds of resolutions from branches across the country opposing the arms race and demanding the conclusion of a peace pact. In the annual election of the Labour Party Executive Committee, two notorious figures who supported the policies of the war-mongers—former Foreign Secretary Morrison and the minister Dalton who dismissed Mrs. Monica Felton after her visit to China and Korea—were defeated and replaced by people who criticized the current arms race. In the middle of Parliament, the pressure of public opinion against rearming Germany forced the Labour Party to disagree with the ruling Conservative Party for the first time since the war, and voted against rearming Germany, which frustrated all the efforts of former Prime Minister Attlee (who was the creator of the "arm Germany" policy, and naturally wanted his party members to support it).
    One million two hundred and fifty thousand British people signed the Stockholm Appeal against the atomic bomb, and approximately the same number signed the declaration for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.
    In the business community, a movement against war policies is unfolding, with some writing letters to the "Times" and others writing letters to the mothers and veterans who held demonstrations against the American germ warfare General Ridgway, because they were sentenced to heavy fines for writing "Ridgway go home" on American cars in the streets of London.
    But it would not be entirely accurate to think that Britain has a strong peace movement. There is a strong sentiment for peace. But the organized peace movement itself is still very fragmented, and the British Peace Committee—the national organization in Britain that cooperates with the World Peace Council—is still very small.
    All the lies and pronouncements of the reactionaries cannot weaken the British people's love of peace, so they have adopted a second line of attack: to cause division among peace lovers themselves. Dr. Johnson has a famous story—this is not the Dean of Canterbury who is also called Dr. Johnson, but the eighteenth-century British writer and dictionary author Dr. Johnson. Once, after spending a night in a not very clean inn, he said: "If the fleas were all united, they could certainly drag me out of bed." This analogy is not very polite to the peace movement, but it is probably still appropriate, because our peace organizations are really too small and too scattered. In any case, this illustrates the power of numbers, that they can do anything as long as they unite their respective forces. Unfortunately, the reactionaries understand this very well and are doing their best to prevent this unity. The British Peace Committee is strictly "banned" by the Labour Party, and any member of this large party who becomes close to the Peace Committee or any communist, even for the sake of peace, is easily expelled from the party. This situation has caused the general movement for peace to manifest itself as the growth of many individual organizations—these are the Friends of China, Friends of the Soviet Union, pacifists, Puritans, Christians, physicians, teachers, scientists, artists, musicians, veterans, women, and other individual groups striving for peace.
    The peace movement cannot be suppressed by prohibitions, and these peace lovers have formed these separate professional groups in order to take active action. We should gradually unite the efforts of these groups through patient explanation. There have been some good signs in this regard. A joint committee arising from all these peace groups has been organized to work against the rearmament of Germany, which is the first time for full cooperation. A British preparatory committee has also been organized to participate in the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna in December, which includes nearly one hundred prominent figures, some of whom have not been active in the peace movement, and some of whom have previously cooperated with the British Peace Committee. In Britain, the social sympathy won by the idea of peace and the world peace movement is now many times stronger than it was a year ago. The current task is to make the actual effect of this sympathy as extensive as the activeness of this sympathy.

    英国的和平运动
    世界和平理事会书记处书记　伊沃尔·蒙塔古
    在亚洲及太平洋区域人民开着盛大会议的同一星期，伦敦举行了一次盛大的示威，所提出的口号是：“对苏联和中国贸易！停止殖民战争！停止在朝鲜和马来亚的战争！把美国轰炸机送回去！我们要和平！”
    英国人民是爱和平的。战争贩子通过报纸、无线电和电影进行强烈的宣传，来挑拨对苏联、各人民民主国家和中国的仇恨，这种企图已经完全失败了。战争贩子的宣传可也尽足以散布混乱的空气，使英国人民弄不清楚许多问题的是非而发生恐惧，使许多人们容忍备战措施，并且往往不信任其他国家所提出的和平建议。但是谁都不要战争，谁都不指望战争。人们也就愈来愈多地逃出了那一种企图笼络人心的迷网，从不同的道路来到和平活动之家了。
    很多的工会年会和合作社协会年会通过了批评政府的好战行动和要求和平的一些决议，至少也往往有虽是少数而足以代表几百万人的投票表示了拥护和平的力量。工人们强硬地抗议军备计划所带来的生活水平降低和物价高涨的后果，曾举行了多次的罢工。工会代表大会——全国各工会的年度代表大会——不顾那一些要求大会不要“恼犯美国”的工会反动领导者的呼吁，终究通过了一项谴责细菌战的决议案。工党年会当场接到了从全国各支部交来的几百件决议案，反对备战运动，要求缔结和平公约。在工党执行委员会的年度选举中，两个拥护战争贩子政策的臭名昭著的家伙——前外交大臣莫里逊和曾经在蒙尼卡·费尔顿夫人访问中国和朝鲜之后，把她免职的那位大臣达尔顿——被打败了，而由批评目前备战运动的人们来接替。在国会中间，不赞成重新武装德国的公共舆论的压力迫得工党在大战后第一次同执政的保守党意见分歧，而投票反对重新武装德国，也就使前首相艾德礼（他是“武装德国”政策的创制人，自然要他的党徒们拥护它）的种种努力落空了。
    一百二十五万英国人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名反对原子弹，约略相等的人数则签名于争取缔结五大国和平公约的宣言。
    在工商界方面，反对战争政策的运动正在展开，有的写信登在“泰晤士”报，有的写信给那些举行反对美国细菌将军李奇微的示威的母亲们和退伍军人们，因为他们在伦敦街头的美国汽车上写了“李奇微回家去”的字样，被判处很重的罚金。
    可是如果认为英国有着强大的和平运动，那也算不得十分正确。争取和平的强大情绪是有的。但组织起来的和平运动本身还是很分散的，而英国和平委员会——和世界和平理事会相配合的在英国的全国性团体——还是非常之小。
    反动派的一切谎言和宣言不能减弱英国人爱和平的情感，它们就采取了第二种进攻的方式：引起和平爱好者们本身的分化。约翰逊博士有一个著名的故事——这不是那位也叫约翰逊博士的坎特伯雷教长，这是十八世纪的英国作家和字典作者约翰逊博士。有一次，他在不很干净的小客店里过了一夜之后，说道：“如果跳蚤全体一致起来，它们是一定可以把我拖到床外去的。”这个比喻对于和平运动不很礼貌，但恐怕也还算得恰当，因为我们的和平组织实在是太小太分散了。无论如何，这总说明了数量的力量，只要他们把各自的力量联合起来，什么事都办得到。不幸反动派很懂得这个道理，便尽心竭力来阻止这种团结。英国和平委员会是被工党严厉地“禁止”的，这个人数众多的政党的任何一个党员如果同和平委员会或是同任何一个共产党员亲密起来，即使为了和平，也还是容易被开除出党的。这种情况，使得一般的争取和平的运动，表现为许多个别的组织的增长——这些就是中国之友，苏联之友，和平主义者，清教徒，基督教徒，医师，教师，科学家，艺术家，音乐家，退伍军人，妇女等等个别的争取和平的团体。
    和平运动不是禁令所能压制的，这些和平爱好者们为了要积极行动起来，就结成了这种各别的职业性集团。我们应当通过耐心的解释，把这些团体的种种努力逐渐地联合起来。关于这一点，已出现了一些良好的迹象。从这一切和平集团产生的联合委员会已经组织起来，进行反对重新武装德国的工作，这是全体合作的第一次。为了参加十二月在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会，英国筹备委员会也已组织起来，其中包括近一百名著名人士，有的在和平运动中向来并不积极，有的是先前就同英国和平委员会合作的。在英国，和平思想和世界和平运动所博得的社会的同情，现在比一年以前强大了许多倍。当前的任务是在于使这种同情的实际作用，达到和这种同情的积极性一样广泛的程度。
