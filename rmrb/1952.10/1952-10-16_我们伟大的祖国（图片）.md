    Our Great Motherland
    Since the completion of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, locomotives have been running day and night through the mountains and loess plateaus of the Northwest, stirring the farmers in every village and town along the line. Every day, groups of people come to see the locomotives, grateful to the People's Government for bringing them the prospect of a happy and prosperous life.
