To the Editor:
    The Hejian County People's Court in Hebei Province created the experience of joint district and joint village collective mediation of civil cases during the work of clearing backlog cases, which quickly completed the task of clearing cases. The county people's court learned in advance that many districts and villages had some unresolved civil disputes, so it first criticized the remaining old legal view of "the people do not sue, the officials do not handle" among the cadres; then sent people to bring the cases accepted and unsettled by the county people's court to the relevant districts, together with the unresolved cases in the districts and villages, and jointly studied the solutions with the district people's government, district Communist Youth League, district democratic women's federation, etc. After everyone reached a consensus, the relevant village cadres and the parties involved in each case were notified to gather together in their spare time. The cadres first explained the policies according to the type of case, then separated into groups, where the parties reported the case details, everyone commented, and finally the cadres conducted mediation according to the policies, so that both parties reached "peace of mind". Using this method, the backlog cases were processed very quickly. One cadre processed sixty-three civil cases in seven days. Except for three cases that did not get a final result, the others were handled reasonably and legally, and both parties were convinced (more than 90% automatically reconciled or voluntarily withdrew their lawsuits). This approach not only facilitates the parties involved in the cases, eliminates the phenomenon of failure to deliver summonses or non-enforcement of judgments or "entanglement in litigation" in the past, but also improves the policy level of county, district, and village cadres.

    河间县人民法院集体调解民事案件效果良好
    编辑同志：河北省河间县人民法院在清理积案的工作中，创造了联区、联村集体调解民事案件的经验，使清案任务很快便完成了。该县人民法院事先了解到许多区、村都有些没有解决的民事纠纷，便先在干部中批判残存的“民不举官不办”的旧法观点；然后派人把县人民法院受理未结的案件分别带到有关各区，连同各区、村所未解决的案件，和区人民政府、区青年团、区民主妇女联合会等共同研究处理办法。在大家的认识取得一致后，即通知有关村干部和各案当事人在空闲时集会一起，由干部先按案件类型讲解政策，再分开小组，由当事人报告案情，大家评论，最后由干部根据政策进行调解，使双方当事人都达到“心平气和”。用这样的办法，处理积案很快。一个干部在七天内便处理了六十三件民事案，其中除三件没得到最后结果外，其他都处理得合理合法，双方当事人也心悦诚服（自动和解和自动撤消诉状的占百分之九十以上）。这种做法，不仅便利案件当事人，消除了过去屡传不到或判决后当事人不执行或“缠讼”的现象，同时也提高了县、区、村干部的政策水平。
