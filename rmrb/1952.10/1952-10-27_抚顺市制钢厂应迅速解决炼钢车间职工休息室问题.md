    The Fushun Steel Plant Should Quickly Resolve the Problem of Restrooms for Workers in the Steelmaking Workshop
    Comrade Editor: The restrooms for workers in the steelmaking workshop of the Fushun Steel Plant in Northeast China were all demolished for some reason around June. At that time, the weather was hot, and everyone could find a place to rest. But now the weather is very cold, and we feel a lot of inconvenience without restrooms (such as no place to eat and change clothes, etc.). The workers have raised their opinions to the factory leaders several times, but it has not been resolved yet. I think this is a major issue related to the health of all the workers in our workshop. I hope the leaders of our factory will quickly resolve the problem of restrooms for workers in the steelmaking workshop.

    抚顺市制钢厂应迅速解决炼钢车间职工休息室问题
    编辑同志：东北抚顺市制钢厂炼钢车间的职工休息室，在六月左右因故全部拆掉了，当时天气热，大家还可以随便找个地方休息。可是现在天气很冷，没有休息室我们感到很多不便（如没有吃饭和换衣服的地方等）。工友们曾向厂的领导方面提出过数次意见，但至今还没解决。我认为这是有关我们全车间职工健康的大问题，希望我厂的领导方面，迅速解决炼钢车间职工休息室的问题。
