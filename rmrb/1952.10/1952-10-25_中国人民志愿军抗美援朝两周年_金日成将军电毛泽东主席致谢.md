Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: On the eve of the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers joining the war to resist America and aid Korea, General Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong of our Central People's Government to express his gratitude. The telegram is as follows:

    Chairman Comrade:
    On the occasion of the second anniversary of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers joining the war to resist America and aid Korea, on behalf of the Korean people, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and myself, I extend my deepest gratitude and respect to you, the brotherly Chinese people who rose up to resist America and aid Korea to defend their homes and country, and to all commanders and fighters of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers.

    The sons and daughters of the great Chinese people—the Chinese People's Volunteers, in coordinated operations with the Korean People's Army, have dealt an irreparable and heavy blow to the American aggressors, laying the foundation for the final victory.

    I am confident that our two peoples' common struggle for peace and independence, receiving the warm support and solidarity of the peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union, will thoroughly crush the enemy and achieve final victory.

    Long live the indestructible friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese people forged in blood!

    Long live the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers!

    Kim Il-sung
    October 23, 1952, in Pyongyang
