Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th – According to a report by United Press International, on the 7th of this month, sixteen more of our captured personnel were injured by the U.S. side in the Koje-do Island prisoner-of-war camp. This news was suppressed by the U.S. military for two days before being revealed, apparently because time was needed to fabricate excuses. According to the report, the U.S. side refused to disclose whether the prisoners were injured by guns or other methods, which is even more sufficient to illustrate the barbaric nature of this atrocity. The U.S. side is now resorting to indefinite adjournment to sabotage the armistice negotiations, and undoubtedly, they will be even more unscrupulous in persecuting prisoners of war in their prisoner-of-war camps who firmly demand repatriation.

    美方又打伤我方战俘十六名
    【新华社开城十一日电】据美国国际新闻社报道，本月七日，美方巨济岛战俘营中又有我方被俘人员十六名被打伤。这个消息被美国军方扣压了两天才透露出来，显然是因为需要时间来编造藉口。据该消息说，美方不肯透露战俘是被用枪还是用别的方法打伤的，这就更足以说明这一暴行的野蛮性质。美方现在已经不惜用无限期休会的手段来破坏停战谈判，无疑地，他们将更加肆无忌惮地在他们的战俘营里迫害坚决要求遣返的战俘。
