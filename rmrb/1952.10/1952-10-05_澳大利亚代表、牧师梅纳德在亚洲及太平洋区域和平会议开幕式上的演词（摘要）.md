    Australian Representative Reverend Maynard's Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference (Abstract)
    On September 14th, a large conference was held in the largest hall in London, with an estimated attendance of about nine thousand people. Due to the unanimous demand of the conference, I brought this parchment document to today's peace conference, bearing the signatures of the speakers and initiators of the conference.
    There were two main reasons for convening that conference. First, everyone wanted to hear the Dean of Canterbury talk about his recent visit to China. You would all be very excited if you could have seen how popular he was when he described the amazing progress made by the People's Republic of China in the three years since its founding.
    The Chinese people have been liberated, freed from exploitation, and the nation has been reborn with brilliant achievements. This has not generated fear, but joy, because the people attending the conference knew that this movement is a peace-loving movement, and there is no reason for it not to continue to be a peace-loving movement. It does not inherently contain the inevitability of aggression like capitalist imperialism.
    I wish you could have seen how enthusiastically everyone welcomed this great report, which spoke so well of how China is expanding freedom, justice, and friendship.
    The second reason for convening this conference was because the Dean's friends wanted to express their trust in him.
    You undoubtedly know how hard the bourgeois newspapers have tried to slander the Dean, and many upper echelons of the church and government have treated him the same way.
    The truth, however, cannot be blocked forever, and the truth about China must be made known to everyone. Not deception, but truth, is truly beneficial to all mankind.
    I am a representative from Australia, a country now controlled by American financial pressure. I do not believe that the Australian people would approve of the actions that hindered other Australian representatives from attending this conference. I do not believe they would approve of the re-militarization of Japan; but they have been instilled with fear and therefore feel very helpless.
    The "Forum for Peace" nominated me as a representative, and I felt it was my duty to accept such a task. I am not a politician and have never participated in any political party; but I am a Christian, and I firmly believe that the best way for a person to serve his country is to be faithful to truth and justice. When I return to Australia, I will strive to truthfully report everything I have seen and experienced here. Shouldn't each of us strive to speak the truth with love?
    Now, please allow me to read this letter signed by the initiators and speakers of the London Conference. The full text of the letter is as follows:
    We, the people of Britain, who attended this great and representative conference held in Queen's Hall, London, now salute the people of China and congratulate you on your third National Day.
    We rejoice in your liberation from exploitation and oppression.
    We watch with admiration and sympathy your vigorous campaigns against corruption, poverty, disease, and ignorance.
    We thank your government for its patience, because we recognize that without its calmness and self-restraint, the Third World War might have already broken out.
    We acknowledge the just demand of the democratically elected Chinese government to have its representative in the United Nations.
    We earnestly wish to cooperate with you in building a peaceful world.
    We oppose any suggestion of war against China and support your call for an immediate cessation of the Korean War.
    Long live peace and friendship between the Chinese and British people!
    Mr. Chairman, the above is a letter that the great gathering in London wished me to bring to the Peace Conference held in Beijing, and I am now honored to present this letter to you. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 澳大利亚代表、牧师梅纳德在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议开幕式上的演词（摘要）

    澳大利亚代表、牧师梅纳德在亚洲及
    太平洋区域和平会议开幕式上的演词  （摘要）
    九月十四日那一天在伦敦最大的一所大厅举行了一次大会，估计大约有九千人出席；由于大会的一致要求，我在今天这个和平会议上带来了这卷羊皮纸的文件，上面有着在大会上的发言的人们和大会发起人的签名。
    那次会议的召开有两个主要的原因。第一，大家要听坎特伯雷教长谈谈他不久以前访问中国的情形。你们一定会感到很兴奋的，假如你们能够看到：当他描述中华人民共和国成立三年以来所获得的惊人进步的时候，是多么受人欢迎。
    中国人民解放了，摆脱了剥削，这个民族新生了，取得了辉煌的成就——这一切并没有产生恐惧，而是产生了喜悦；因为出席大会的人都知道这运动是一个爱好和平的运动，而且也没有理由不让它不继续成为一个爱好和平的运动。它本身并不像资本帝国主义那样包含侵略的必然性。
    我愿意你们能够亲眼看到大家是如何热情地欢迎这篇伟大的报告，讲得这么好，都是关于中国如何正在扩大自由、正义和友谊的。
    要召开这次大会的第二个原因是因为教长的朋友们要想借此表示他们对他的信任。
    你们无疑地一定知道那些资产阶级报纸如何费尽心机来污蔑教长，而许多教会和政府的上层分子也这样对待他。
    真相无论如何不能永远被封锁，而有关中国的真相一定得让大家知道。不是欺骗而是真相，才是真正有利于全人类的。
    我是一个从澳大利亚来的代表，这个国家现在正被控制于美国的财政压力之下。我不相信澳大利亚人民会赞成那种阻挠其他澳大利亚代表来出席这次会议的行为。我不相信他们会赞成重新使日本军国主义化；可是他们已经被灌输了恐惧，因此感到很没有办法。
    “争取和平座谈会”推举了我作为一个代表，我感到我有责任接受这样一个任务。我不是一个政治家，也没有参加过任何政党；但是，我是一个基督徒，我深信一个人为祖国服务的最好方法是忠实地对待真理与正义。当我回到澳大利亚以后，我将努力真实地报道我在这里所看到的和所经历到的一切。难道我们每一个人不应该努力以相爱的态度把真理说出来吗？
    现在请允许我诵读这篇由伦敦大会发起人与发言者签名的信件。这封信的全文如下：
    我们英国人民参加了这次在伦敦皇后大厅举行的伟大的具有代表性的会议，现在向中国人民致意，祝贺你们的第三届国庆节。
    我们为你们从剥削和压迫之下解放出来而欢欣。
    我们以敬仰和同情的心情，注视着你们雷厉风行地进行反对贪污、贫困、疾病和愚昧的运动。
    我们感谢你们政府的耐心，因为我们认识到假如没有它的冷静和自制，第三次世界大战可能已经爆发了。
    我们承认用民主方式选举出来的中国政府的正义要求，在联合国里应该有它的代表。
    我们热诚地愿望和你们合作，共同建设一个和平的世界。
    我们反对任何对中国作战的建议，并且支援你们要求立即停止朝鲜战争的号召。
    中、英人民之间的和平与友谊万岁！
    主席先生，以上就是在伦敦举行的那次伟大的集会所希望我带给在北京召开的和平会议的一封信，现在我很感荣幸能够献给你们这封信。（新华社）
