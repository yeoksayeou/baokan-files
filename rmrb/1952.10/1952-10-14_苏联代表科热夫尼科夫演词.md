    We, the Soviet people, extend our warm greetings to the great Chinese people, the heroic people, the builders of a new, free and happy country, the leader of the Chinese people, the sun of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong!
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has completed its work with the unanimous unity of all representatives. This conference, like a mirror, reflects the sincere unity of the people of all countries in the struggle for peace.
    The conference enthusiastically adopted resolutions of historical significance, which encourage the people of all countries to further struggle for peace, against aggression, against oppression and the colonial plunder system.
    The people of Asia and the Pacific countries have announced in a loud voice their unwavering determination to defend the sacred cause of peace.
    The giant wave of the people can extinguish the flames of war, because there is no force in the world more powerful than the united people. We abhor war and we hope that the people of the world will be friendly to each other.
    The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is as solid as the Tianshan Mountains. It is a strong fortress of peace and a great example of friendly cooperation and mutual assistance among the people of all countries for happiness and prosperity.
    The great creative victories achieved by the Chinese people in building a new country, as well as their tremendous achievements in other aspects, fill our hearts with joy and make us love the Chinese people even more.
    The historical achievements of the Chinese people are an example to the people of all countries, inspiring them to fight for peace, independence, freedom and happiness.
    Comrade Stalin, the great standard-bearer of peace and the leader of all working people, has pointed out the path for the people of all countries with his doctrines. He fills us with strong confidence that as long as the people of all countries take on the cause of defending peace, peace can be maintained and consolidated.
    The people of the world will surely be able to save peace!
    Peace will surely triumph over war!
