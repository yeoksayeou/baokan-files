    Intra-Party Democracy
    ——September 11th Soviet Pravda Editorial
    The preparations for the 19th Party Congress are proceeding in an atmosphere of high activity on the part of the Communist Party members.
    The broad masses of Party members unanimously support the documents submitted to the Congress by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). While Communist Party members put forward their own opinions and supplements to these documents, they also expose and criticize the shortcomings in the work of Party organizations at all levels and their leaders. They care about the further consolidation of the Party ranks and the improvement of their combat effectiveness, and about the smooth realization of the new tasks of communist construction, in the posture of masters of their own Party.
    The entire activity of Party organizations at all levels in these days is a vivid manifestation of the Leninist-Stalinist principle of intra-Party democracy (an unbreakable law of intra-Party life). As early as forty-five years ago, Lenin, pointing out that our Party was organized according to democratic principles, wrote:
    “This means that all the work of our Party, without exception, is carried out directly or through its representatives by all Party members who enjoy equal rights...”
    The Communist Party has consistently developed intra-Party democracy. This is the most important method of consolidating and uniting our Party ranks and enhancing the combat effectiveness of Party members in the struggle to realize the lifeblood of the Soviet system - the Party's policies.
    Comrade Stalin teaches: "Intra-Party democracy is to raise the initiative of the Party masses and consolidate the unity of the Party, consolidate the conscious proletarian discipline within the Party."
    The draft revision of the Party Statute submitted by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) for consideration by the 19th Congress is permeated with concern for strict adherence to and further development of the democratic principles of intra-Party life. The draft declares that the unbreakable guiding principle of the Party's organizational structure is democratic centralism, which means that all leading bodies of the Party, from the highest to the lowest, are elected, and Party organs must report their work to their Party organizations regularly, strictly observe Party discipline and the minority obeys the majority, and lower-level organs absolutely obey the decisions of higher-level organs.
    Article 28 of the draft revision of the Party Statute points out:
    “Free and earnest discussion of Party policy issues within individual organizations or within the entire Party is an inalienable right that every Party member should have under the intra-Party democracy system. Only on the basis of intra-Party democracy can Bolshevik self-criticism be developed and Party discipline be consolidated, and Party discipline should be conscious, not mechanical."
    The draft revision of the Party Statute affirms the immutability of the principle of intra-Party democracy, and also sets out some conditions under which intra-Party democracy can be guaranteed to benefit the cause and not be used to harm the Party and the working class.
    The Leninist-Stalinist Party requires every one of its members not only to unconditionally and voluntarily fulfill their obligations and to have a high degree of responsibility for the Party's cause, but also to fully utilize all the rights they should have under the intra-Party democracy system.
    The draft revision of the Party Statute stipulates that Party members have the right to participate in free and earnest discussions of Party policy issues at Party meetings or in Party publications, to criticize any Party worker at Party meetings, to elect and be elected to Party organs, to request personal participation when resolutions are passed regarding their activities or conduct, and to raise any questions and make any statements to any level of Party organs up to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
    Constantly and thoroughly implementing intra-Party democracy and creating conditions for each Communist Party member to accurately fulfill their obligations and obtain their rights is the basic duty of all Party organizations and their leaders. However, we encounter some leaders who forget this, work in a sinful manner, undermine intra-Party democracy, and refuse to listen to the voices of the masses. They mistakenly believe that there seem to be two kinds of discipline in our Party, one for ordinary Party members and the other for leading figures. Our Party has only one discipline, one law, which all Communist Party members should abide by, regardless of their merits and positions.
    The general membership meetings of the Party's primary organizations and the Party congresses at all levels have shown that Party members have increasingly raised their demands on their leaders. At these meetings, Party members ruthlessly exposed and resolutely criticized the bureaucratic understanding of intra-Party democracy and Bolshevik discipline by individual workers. Party members do not elect those who are incompetent to the Party organs to which they are entrusted.
    Take the Party Congress of the city of Rolidopol as an example. The delegates exposed comrades Besklyubinko, the secretary of the municipal party committee, and Kalomintsev's detachment from the masses, failing to listen to criticism from below, and conniving with those who violated state discipline. It is natural that they were not elected as secretaries of the municipal party committee this time. Comrade Slesharenko, the former secretary of the Ulyanovsk municipal party committee, was also not elected to the municipal party committee this time, because he took a superficial attitude towards the criticisms raised by others and no longer interacted with Party members.
    Our Party's democracy is a democracy of action. The Party is concerned about the extensive development of the initiative and spontaneity of its members. The more active Communist Party members are in political life and production activities, the smoother the work of the Party organization will be, and the stronger its combat effectiveness in solving economic and political tasks will be.
    It is intolerable that in many places general membership meetings are not convened regularly, and the preparatory work before the meetings is not done well, so they cannot attract Party members to participate in the work of their Party organizations. This serious shortcoming has been pointed out at the district party congresses in Irkutsk Oblast, Kalinin Oblast, Novosibirsk Oblast, and other provinces.
    The general membership meeting is the highest leading body of the primary organization. At this meeting, Party members discuss important issues in the national political and economic life, and the work and tasks of their Party organization, so they are ideologically trained, and cultivate organization, discipline, and a high degree of responsibility for the implementation of the Party and government resolutions. The task of the Party organs is to convene such meetings regularly, and attract Party members to participate extensively in the discussion of various issues and the work of implementing the established resolutions.
    The Party's leadership is collective leadership. This is one of its sources of strength. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the decisions of a single individual are often, or almost always, one-sided. Some leaders pay little attention to improving the role of the plenary sessions of the Party committees, violate the established convening dates, or conduct such sessions at a low level, which brings great losses to the cause. Some plenary sessions, especially the plenary sessions of the Yaroslavl Municipal Committee and the Nalchik Municipal Committee, committed the above-mentioned serious shortcomings.
    In these Party organizations and some other Party organizations, Party activists' meetings are rarely convened, and sometimes they are convened without the necessary preparation beforehand. Obviously, they have forgotten the special significance of the Party activists' meetings in the life of the Party organization, and forgotten that such meetings are the key to conveying the Party's resolutions to the Party members and the non-Party masses, and are the backbone of the Party committee. The draft revision of the Party Statute points out that in the centers of cities and districts, Party activists' meetings of the city and district organizations should be convened to discuss important resolutions of the Party and the government. The convening of activists' meetings should not be for show, to endorse these resolutions in form and ritual, but to truly discuss these resolutions.
    Comrade Stalin taught: "We must listen carefully to the opinions of the masses, we must listen carefully to the opinions of ordinary Party members, we must listen carefully to the opinions of the so-called 'unimportant people,' we must listen carefully to the opinions of the people." Quickly and earnestly eliminating the shortcomings pointed out by Party members at congresses, plenary sessions, representative meetings, in letters, and in newspapers, and implementing their valuable suggestions, will create good conditions for continuously improving the initiative and spontaneity of the Party masses and for developing criticism and self-criticism from below.
    Being able to continuously and consistently implement the Leninist-Stalinist principles of intra-Party democracy, and promote the initiative and spontaneity of Party members, the Party organization will make its ranks more consolidated, and further enhance its role in the struggle to accomplish the tasks set by the Leninist-Stalinist Party.

    党内民主
    ——九月十一日苏联真理报社论
    十九次党代表大会的筹备工作，在共产党员发挥高度积极性的气氛中进行着。
    广大党员群众一致拥护联共（布）党中央提交代表大会的文件。共产党员一方面对这些文件提出自己的意见和补充，同时也揭发和批评了各级地方党组织及其领导者工作中的缺点，他们以自己党的主人翁姿态关怀着党的队伍底进一步巩固及其战斗力的提高，关怀着共产主义建设新任务底顺利实现。
    这些天来各级党组织底整个活动，是列宁斯大林的党内民主（党内生活牢不可破的法则）原则底鲜明表现。早在四十五年以前，列宁在指出我们的党按民主原则组织起来时即曾写道：
    “这就是说，我们党的一切工作，都是毫无例外地享有平等权利的全体党员直接或通过其代表来进行的……”
    共产党始终不断地开展党内民主。这是巩固和团结我们党的队伍，提高党员在实现苏维埃制度的生命基础——党的政策的斗争中的战斗力底最重要方法。
    斯大林同志教导说：“党内民主就是提高党员群众的积极性并巩固党的统一，巩固党内自觉的无产阶级纪律”。
    联共（布）中央提交十九次代表大会审查的党章底修正草案，浸透着对严格遵守及进一步发扬党内生活的民主原则的关怀。草案宣称党的组织结构的牢不可破的指导原则是民主集中制，这就是说，党的一切领导机关，由最高的到最低的，都是选举出来的，党的机关要向自己党的组织作定期的工作报告，严格遵守党的纪律和少数服从多数，下级机关绝对服从上级机关的决议。
    党章修正草案第二十八条指出：
    “在个别组织内或在全党内自由而认真地讨论党的政策问题，是每个党员根据党内民主制所应有的不可剥夺的权利。只有在党内民主制的基础上才能够展开布尔什维克的自我批评和巩固党的纪律，党的纪律应当是自觉的，而不是机械的。”
    党章修正草案肯定了党内民主原则底不可动摇性，同时也确定了一些条件，只有在这些条件下才可保证党内民主有利于事业，而不会被利用来损害党和工人阶级。
    列宁斯大林党要求它的每一个党员不仅要无条件地、自愿地履行自己的义务并对党的事业具有高度的责任心，而且也要求他们充分地利用根据党内民主制的所应有的一切权利。
    党章修正草案中指明，党员有权在党的会议上或党的报刊上参加党的政策问题的自由的、认真的讨论，在党的会议上批评党的任何工作人员，选举和被选举到党的机关，凡在通过关于自己的活动或行为的决议时，要求亲自参加，向党的任何一级机关直到苏联共产党中央委员会提出任何问题和声明。
    不断地、彻底地实行党内民主，为每个共产党员确切履行其义务及获得其权利而创造条件，是一切党组织及其领导者的基本职责。然而，我们遇到这样一些领导者，他们忘记了这一点，以罪恶的方法进行工作，破坏党内民主，不肯倾听群众的呼声。他们错误地认为，好像我们党内有两种纪律，一种是对普通党员的，另一种是对领导人物的。我们的党只有一个纪律，一个法律，一切共产党员不管他的功绩和职位如何，均应遵守。
    党的基层组织的全体党员会议及各级党代表会议，都表明了党员群众对自己的领导者日益提高了要求，党员们在这些会议上无情地揭露并坚决批判个别工作人员对党内民主和布尔什维克纪律的老爷式的理解。党员不选举那些不能胜任付予他的信赖的人到党的机关里去。
    拿罗里多波尔市的党代表会议为例。代表们揭露了市委书记别斯克卢宾科同志和喀洛敏采夫同志脱离群众，不倾听下边的批评和纵容破坏国家纪律的情况。他们这次没有被选为市委书记是很自然的。前乌里扬诺夫斯克市委书记斯列沙林科同志这次也没有当选市委，因为他对别人提出的批评意见采取表面应付的态度，并和党员们不再来往。
    我们党内的民主制，是行动的民主制。党关怀自己党员的主动性和自动性的广泛开展。共产党员在政治生活及生产活动中表现得愈积极，党组织的工作便愈顺利，它在解决经济政治任务中的战斗性也就愈强。
    有许多地方未正规地召开全体党员大会，会前的准备工作也作的不好，因此它们就不能吸引党员参加自己党组织的工作，这种现象是不能容忍的。伊尔库茨克州，加里宁州，诺沃西比尔斯克州和其他省的区党代表会议上，都已指出这一严重缺点。
    全体党员大会，是基层组织的最高领导机关。党员在这种会议上讨论国家政治经济生活中的重要问题，及自己党组织的工作情况与任务，这样他们便得到思想锻炼，培养了组织性、纪律性及实现党和政府决议的高度责任心。党机关的任务就是要正规地召开这种会议，吸引党员广泛参加对各种问题的讨论与实现既定决议的工作。
    党的领导是集体领导。这便是它的力量来源之一。斯大林同志指出，单个人的决定经常是，或几乎经常是片面的。有些领导者很少关怀提高党委会全体会议的作用，破坏既定的召集日期，或在低劣的水平上进行这种会议，这些人为事业带来巨大的损失。有些全会，特别是雅罗斯拉夫市委会及纳里契克市委会的全体会议，即犯了上述的严重缺点。
    在这些党组织和其他一些党组织里，很少召开党的活动分子会议，有时是缺乏会前的必要准备即行召开。很显然，他们忘记了党的活动分子会议在党组织的生活中所具有的特殊意义，忘记了这种会议是将党的决议传达给党与非党群众的关键，是党委会的支柱。党章修正草案中指出：在城市和区的中心，应召开党的城市和区组织的活动分子会议，讨论党和政府的重要决议。活动分子会议的召开不应是为了做做样子，在形式上和仪式上赞同这些决议，而是为了真正讨论这些决议。
    斯大林同志教导说：“必须仔细倾听群众的意见，必须仔细倾听普通党员的意见，必须仔细倾听所谓的‘无关重要的人’的意见，必须仔细倾听人民的意见”。迅速而认真地消灭党员在大会上、全会上、代表会议上、信件中和报纸上指出的缺点，实现他们的宝贵建议，这便会为不断提高党员群众的积极性与自动性，为开展自下而上的批评与自我批评创造良好的条件。
    能够不断地、始终一贯地实行列宁斯大林的党内民主制的原则，发扬党员的积极性与自动性，党组织将会使自己的队伍更加巩固，使自己在为完成列宁斯大林党所提出的任务的斗争中的作用，更加提高。
