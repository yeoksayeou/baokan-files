    Our Great Motherland Advances on the Road of Peaceful Construction
    --Celebrating the Third Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China
    The great People's Republic of China, from the day it announced its establishment to the world, has unfolded a new page in the history of the oppressed people of the East. For three years, our great motherland, like the rising sun, has burst forth with its hidden, infinite light and heat. With the power of an overwhelming force, it has swept away the historical filth accumulated over thousands of years, opening up a new path of peaceful and happy life for 475 million people, and inspiring the people of the world. This makes our enemies tremble with fear and our friends rejoice.
    Under the great banner of Mao Zedong, the new things that the Chinese people have dreamed of for generations have been realized in these three years. We have achieved true national independence and gained lofty honor in the international community. All of our country's territory, except for Taiwan, has been liberated. The people of all ethnic groups and strata in the country are closely united in one big family, achieving true national unity. People's democratic politics have been realized, the people have taken control of the government, the government serves the people, bandits and counter-revolutionaries have been eliminated, and land reform has been completed in more than 90 percent of the agricultural areas. Our people's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the patriotic health movement have defeated the U.S. aggressors and their germ warfare. The Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Increase Production and Practice Economy Movements have changed the social atmosphere, corruption, waste, and bureaucracy have been eliminated, and the "five poisons" of the bourgeoisie that are harmful to the country have been eliminated; this has fundamentally improved our country's financial and economic situation and laid the foundation for smooth large-scale construction in the future. The unprecedented increase in the level of patriotic consciousness of the people throughout the country, the further consolidation of the People's Democratic United Front and the system of the People's Democratic Dictatorship, and especially the continued consolidation and development of our country's unbreakable fraternal alliance with the Soviet Union, the combination of these factors has enabled our national defense and economic construction to achieve rapid development. Our industrial and agricultural production has been restored to and, in terms of major products, surpassed the highest levels before the War of Resistance Against Japan; water conservancy projects equivalent to ten Panama Canals or twenty-three Suez Canals have been built; the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, which could not be realized in the past forty years, have also been successfully built in a short period of time; the movement to eliminate illiteracy is being carried out throughout the country; and the people's economic and cultural life is full of vigor, with countless heroes and model figures emerging on all fronts. All this seems like an unbelievable miracle, but it is a living reality in front of people.
    The high political enthusiasm and creative labor of the masses of the people are the source of all our achievements in the past three years. Our people, on the one hand, resisted U.S. aggression and aided Korea, opposed the aggression of U.S. imperialism, and made great contributions to safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world; on the other hand, they assisted the people's government in consolidating national defense, implementing key construction projects, comprehensively restoring the national economy, stabilizing prices, and achieving a balance in national financial revenue and expenditure. Such achievements are absolutely impossible in capitalist countries. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government can the Chinese people carry out organized, planned, and conscious activities, and thus a new law of development completely different from capitalism has emerged in our social and economic life. This fully proves that our people's democratic system has great superiority over the capitalist system. Our national system is guided by the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution; the superiority of this system proves that Marxism-Leninism has invincible power.
    Now, unfolding before the Chinese people is a new stage of large-scale peaceful construction. Our people throughout the country are full of confidence in creating even greater achievements in this new stage. Our construction policy is to establish the foundation of national industrialization, gradually improve the people's material and cultural living standards, and cultivate and train a large number of talents needed for national construction, so that our country can steadily develop towards the great future of socialism. However, in order to realize large-scale construction, there must be a peaceful international environment. Precisely for this reason, while carrying out large-scale construction, we must also strive to consolidate national defense, unite all international friends, and safeguard peace in the Far East and the world.
    Our country's great achievements in the past three years have been achieved entirely in accordance with the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong. In the future, as long as we continue to advance in the direction indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong, new victories will surely belong to us. Three years ago, in his opening speech at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Our state system of the people's democratic dictatorship is a powerful weapon for guaranteeing the victorious achievements of the people's revolution and opposing the restoration conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad. We must firmly grasp this weapon. Internationally, we must unite with all countries and peoples who love peace and freedom, first of all, with the Soviet Union and the various new democratic countries, so that our struggle to safeguard the victorious achievements of the people's revolution and oppose the restoration conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad will not be in an isolated position. As long as we adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and unite with international friends, we will always be victorious." Consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship internally and uniting with international friends externally is our country's general policy for the past three years; in the future, we must continue to do so in order to ensure the victory of our country's large-scale construction.
    The conditions for large-scale construction in the future, from our domestic perspective, are already in place. Our country's population accounts for one-fourth of the world's population, and after the social reform movement, the people throughout the country have been further awakened and organized; our territory accounts for more than one-fourth of the total area of Asia, and there are endless treasures completely in the hands of our own people; our national defense strength has been enhanced, and the financial and economic situation has been fundamentally improved; our national system is superior, and we have the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party with long-term revolutionary experience. Undoubtedly, in the large-scale construction in the future, our country's potential strength will be unleashed immeasurably. From the international perspective, the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to our country and the cooperation between the people's democratic countries and our country have provided favorable international conditions for our country's large-scale construction. The Soviet government and people have given us noble friendly assistance in the past three years, which has played a significant role in our country's economic recovery and development. The recent successful negotiations between China and the Soviet Union on important political and economic issues and the documents that have been published further prove this point. The people of our country sincerely thank the Soviet Union for its assistance.
    For the sake of peaceful construction and the happy life of the people, we must also strive for a universally secure and lasting peaceful international environment. This is an important part of the international conditions needed for our national construction and is also the common demand of the people of the world. Without a universally secure and lasting peaceful international environment, we will lack the necessary guarantees for carrying out comprehensive, planned, and long-term peaceful construction. The people of our country have always loved peace. Today, we have become masters of our own country and have infinite hope for a happy life in the future. We must work harder to strive for and defend peace in the Far East and the world.
    We see very clearly that the imperialists will not automatically abandon their plans for aggression and allow us to engage in peaceful construction at ease. In the three years since the victory of the people's revolution in our country, U.S. imperialism has never stopped its aggression against our country. At first, it ordered the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to bomb and blockade our country's southeast coast, but it quickly failed. Then, it launched an adventurous aggression against Korea, our country's neighbor, while occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, advancing towards our northeastern border, and continuously bombing and strafing the Northeast. The people of our country could no longer tolerate it and rose up to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea; the people of our country organized the Chinese People's Volunteers and, together with the Korean People's Army, drove the aggressors back to the south of the 38th parallel. Now, the U.S. aggressors are still continuing to delay the Korean armistice negotiations, continuing to massacre prisoners of war, continuing to carry out germ warfare, wantonly bombing peaceful residents and peaceful facilities in the rear of Korea, and continuing to carry out military provocations against our country; the U.S. troops and warships are still continuing to occupy our country's territory of Taiwan. In particular, the forces of Japanese militarism, fostered by the United States, are reviving, seriously threatening our country's security. Therefore, we must continue to consolidate national defense, continue to strengthen resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of Japanese aggression in order to safeguard our country's security.
    The U.S. imperialists' aggressive conspiracies and war policies are universally threatening the peaceful lives of the people of all countries. The United States is frantically expanding its military, establishing military bases everywhere, and trying its best to instigate new wars, which has caused the people of many countries to experience severe pain. Especially in the Asian and Pacific region, if the United States is allowed to collude with the Japanese reactionaries and revive Japanese militarism, the result will inevitably be that the disasters caused by the Second World War will fall upon the heads of the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific region again. This is something that all peace-loving people can never tolerate. This is the reason why the peace movement of the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific region is surging. The peace-loving people of our country must closely join hands with the peace-loving people of all countries, unite as one, and jointly oppose the U.S. war policy and the revival of Japanese militarism, oppose the unilateral peace treaty with Japan, demand the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, demand the immediate realization of the Korean armistice on a fair and reasonable basis, demand the prohibition of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, demand the signing of a peace pact by the five major powers of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, implement disarmament, and strive to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world. On this National Day, the people of our country are warmly welcoming the peace representatives of the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific region who have recently come to Beijing. We firmly believe that countries with different political systems can coexist peacefully. We are willing to establish friendly relations with the people of all countries and nations on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, trade, and cultural exchange in order to realize the common peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries.
    We have full confidence in securing a universally secure and lasting peaceful international environment; we have the strength to defend peace, build our great motherland, and create a new life of peace and happiness. We are convinced that Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant foresight will continue to become a great reality under the continuous efforts of our people. This brilliant foresight of Comrade Mao Zedong was also what he said at the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference three years ago. He said: "The people's democratic dictatorship and uniting international friends will enable our construction work to achieve rapid success. Economic construction work on a national scale has already been placed before us. Our excellent conditions are a population of 475 million and a territory of 9,597,000 square kilometers. The difficulties before us exist, and there are many of them, but we are convinced that all difficulties will be overcome by the heroic struggle of the people of the whole country. The Chinese people already have extremely rich experience in overcoming difficulties. If our ancestors and ourselves could get through long years of extreme hardship and overcome powerful domestic and foreign reactionaries, why can't we build a prosperous and strong country after victory? As long as we maintain the style of hard struggle, as long as we unite as one, as long as we adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and unite with international friends, we can rapidly achieve victory on the economic front." Let us firmly remember Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction, let the people of our country rise up in unison, further consolidate the system of the people's democratic dictatorship at home, and unite with international friends more widely abroad, so that our great motherland will advance towards a new era of large-scale peaceful construction!

    我们伟大的祖国向着和平建设的大道前进
    ——庆祝中华人民共和国第三届国庆节
    伟大的中华人民共和国，从它向全世界宣布成立的那一天起，就在东方被压迫民族人民的历史上展开了新的一页。三年以来，我们伟大的祖国，正如东升的朝阳，迸发着它潜藏的无限的光和热。它以排山倒海的威力，扫除了几千年积压下来的历史污垢，开辟着四亿七千五百万人民和平幸福生活的新道路，鼓舞了全世界的人民。这使我们的敌人胆战心惊，使我们的朋友兴高采烈。
    在伟大的毛泽东旗帜下，我国人民多少世代以来梦寐以求的新事物，在这三年中实现了。我们实现了真正的民族独立，在国际上获得崇高的荣誉。我国的领土，除台湾以外，已经全部解放了。国内各民族各阶层的人民，亲密团结在一个大家庭里，实现了真正的国家统一。人民的民主政治已经实现了，人民掌握了政权，政府替人民办事，土匪和反革命分子被肃清，百分之九十以上的农业地区完成了土地改革。我国人民的抗美援朝运动和爱国卫生运动打败了美国侵略者及其细菌战。三反、五反和增产节约运动改变了社会风气，贪污、浪费和官僚主义被肃清了，资产阶级中对国家有害的“五毒”被肃清了；这就使我国财政经济状况根本好转，并且奠定了今后顺利进行大规模建设的基础。全国人民爱国主义觉悟程度的空前提高，人民民主统一战线和人民民主专政制度的更加巩固，特别是我国和苏联的牢不可破的兄弟同盟的继续巩固与发展，这些因素的结合，就使得我们的国防和经济建设事业获得突飞猛进的发展。我国工农业生产都已经恢复到并在主要生产品方面超过了抗日战争以前最高的水平；相当于十条巴拿马运河或二十三条苏彝士运河的水利工程修建起来了；过去四十余年不能实现的成渝铁路和天兰铁路也在短时间内修筑成功了；扫除文盲的运动正在全国范围内开展起来；人民的经济与文化生活充满了蓬蓬勃勃的朝气，在各个战线上出现了无数的英雄和模范人物。这一切仿佛是令人难以相信的奇迹，可是它们却是摆在人们面前的活生生的现实。
    人民群众高度的政治积极性，和创造性的劳动，是我国三年来一切成就的源泉。我国人民一面抗美援朝，反对美帝国主义的侵略，为保卫远东与世界的和平做了巨大的贡献；一面协助人民政府巩固国防、实行重点建设、全面恢复国民经济，并使物价稳定、国家财政收支达到平衡。这样的成就在资本主义国家是绝对不可能的。只有在中国共产党和中央人民政府领导之下，中国人民才能够进行有组织、有计划的自觉的活动，因而在我们的社会经济生活中，就出现了与资本主义完全不同的新的发展规律。这充分证明我国人民民主制度，较之资本主义制度具有极大的优越性。我们的国家制度，是以马克思列宁主义和中国革命的实际相结合的思想为指导的；这个制度的优越性又证明了马克思列宁主义具有无敌的力量。
    现在，展开在中国人民面前的，是一个大规模的和平建设的新阶段。我们全国人民充满着信心要在这个新阶段中创造更大的成绩。我们的建设方针是建立国家工业化的基础，逐步提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平，大量培养与训练国家建设所需要的人材，使我国能够稳步地向着社会主义的伟大前途发展。但是为了实现大规模的建设，又必须有和平的国际环境。正是因为这个原故，所以我们在进行大规模建设的时候，要同时努力巩固国防，和团结一切国际友人，保卫远东和世界的和平。
    我国过去三年来的伟大成就，完全是按照毛泽东同志的指示而达到的。今后只要我们继续按照毛泽东同志指示的方向前进，新的胜利就一定属于我们。三年以前，在中国人民政治协商会议的开幕词中，毛泽东同志指出：“我们的人民民主专政的国家制度是保障人民革命的胜利成果和反对内外敌人的复辟阴谋的有力的武器，我们必须牢牢地掌握这个武器。在国际上，我们必须和一切爱好和平自由的国家和人民团结在一起，首先是和苏联及各新民主国家团结在一起，使我们的保障人民革命胜利成果和反对内外敌人复辟阴谋的斗争不致处于孤立地位。只要我们坚持人民民主专政和团结国际友人，我们就会是永远胜利的。”对内巩固人民民主专政，对外团结国际友人，这是我们国家三年来的总方针；今后我们更要继续这样做去，以保证我国大规模建设事业的胜利。
    今后大规模建设的条件，从我们国内来说，已经具备了。我国的人口占全人类的四分之一，而且经过了社会改革运动全国人民已经进一步觉悟起来和组织起来了；我们的国土占亚洲总面积四分之一强，而且有完全掌握在人民自己手里的无尽的宝藏；我们的国防力量已经增强，财政经济状况也已根本好转；我们的国家制度是优越的，更有具有长期革命经验的中国共产党的领导。无疑的，在今后的大规模建设中，我国的潜在力量将会不可限量地发挥出来。从国际方面来说，苏联对于我国无私的援助及人民民主各国与我国的合作，使我国大规模的建设具备了有利的国际条件。苏联政府和人民在过去三年间给了我们以高贵的友谊的援助，对于我国经济的恢复与发展起了重大的作用。最近中苏两国关于在重要政治经济问题上已经取得一致的成功的谈判及其已经发表的文件，更加证明了这一点。我国人民衷心感谢苏联的援助。
    为了和平建设，为了人民的幸福生活，我们还必须争取一个普遍安全与持久和平的国际环境。这是我们的国家建设所需要的国际条件的重要部分，也是全世界人民的共同要求。没有普遍安全与持久和平的国际环境，我们要进行全面的、有计划的、长期的和平建设，就缺乏应有的保证。我国人民素来是热爱和平的，我们今天做了自己国家的主人，对于未来的幸福生活抱着无限的希望，我们就更要努力争取与保卫远东及世界的和平。
    我们看得很清楚，帝国主义者是不会自动放弃侵略计划，而让我们从容从事和平建设的。美国帝国主义者在我国人民革命胜利后的三年间，一直没有停止对于我国的侵略。它起先命令蒋介石匪帮残余集团轰炸和封锁我国东南沿海，但是很快失败了。接着，它就发动了对于我国近邻朝鲜的冒险侵略，同时侵占我国领土台湾，向我东北边境进犯，并向东北不断进行轰炸与扫射。我国人民忍无可忍，起来抗美援朝；我国人民组织了抗美援朝志愿军，与朝鲜人民军在一起，把侵略者打退到三八线以南。现在，美国侵略者还在继续拖延朝鲜停战谈判，继续屠杀战俘，继续进行细菌战，滥炸朝鲜后方和平居民与和平设备，并继续向我国进行军事挑衅；美国的军队和兵舰还继续侵占我国的领土台湾。特别是在美国扶植下的日本军国主义势力正在复活起来，严重地威胁着我国的安全。因此，我们必须继续巩固国防，继续加强抗美援朝，支持中国人民志愿军，并采取有效的措施，防止日本侵略的重演，以保卫我国的安全。
    美国帝国主义的侵略阴谋和战争政策，是普遍威胁着各国人民的和平生活的。美国疯狂地扩充军备，到处建立军事基地，极力挑动新的战争，已使许多国家的人民感受着严重的痛苦。特别是在亚洲及太平洋区域，如果听任美国勾结日本反动派，复活日本的军国主义，其结果必然会使第二次世界大战所造成的灾难，重新落到亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的头上。这是一切爱好和平的人民所决不能容忍的。目前亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的和平运动，所以风起云涌的原因就在这里。热爱和平的我国人民，一定要和一切爱好和平的各国人民亲密地携起手来，团结一致，共同反对美国的战争政策和日本军国主义的复活，反对片面的对日和约，要求签订全面的对日和约，要求在公平合理的基础上立即实现朝鲜停战，要求禁用原子武器、细菌武器及其他大规模杀人的武器，要求签订中、苏、美、英、法五大国和平公约，实行裁减军备，为保卫远东与世界的和平而奋斗。在这次国庆节，我国人民都在热烈欢迎最近来到北京的亚洲及太平洋区域的各国人民的和平代表。我们深信，不同政治制度的国家是能够和平相处的，我们愿意与一切国家和民族的人民，建立平等往来、互利通商、文化交流的友好关系，以便实现各国人民共同的和平愿望。
    我们完全有信心能够争取一个普遍安全与持久和平的国际环境；我们有力量保卫和平，建设我们的伟大祖国，创造和平幸福的新生活。我们确信毛泽东同志英明的预见，一定会在我国人民不断的努力之下，继续成为伟大的现实。毛泽东同志的这一个英明的预见，也是他在三年前的中国人民政治协商会议开幕的时候说的。他说：“人民民主专政和团结国际友人，将使我们的建设工作获得迅速的成功。全国规模的经济建设工作业已摆在我们面前。我们的极好条件是有四万万七千五百万的人口和九百五十九万七千方公里的国土。我们面前的困难是有的，而且是很多的，但是我们确信：一切困难都将被全国人民的英勇奋斗所战胜。中国人民已经具有战胜困难的极其丰富的经验。如果我们的先人和我们自己能够渡过长期的极端艰难的岁月，战胜了强大的内外反动派，为什么不能在胜利以后建设一个繁荣昌盛的国家呢？只要我们仍然保持艰苦奋斗的作风，只要我们团结一致，只要我们坚持人民民主专政和团结国际友人，我们就能在经济战线上迅速地获得胜利。”让我们牢牢地记取毛泽东同志的这一指示，让我们全国人民一致奋发起来，在国内更加巩固人民民主专政的制度，在国外更加广泛地团结国际友人，使我们伟大的祖国向大规模的和平建设的新时期前进吧！
