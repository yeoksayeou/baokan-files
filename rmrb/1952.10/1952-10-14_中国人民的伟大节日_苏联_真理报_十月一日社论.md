    The Great Festival of the Chinese People
    -- Soviet "Pravda" October 1st Editorial

    Three years ago, on October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed. The Chinese people are celebrating this significant day – their great National Day.

    All the Soviet people and all progressive humanity share the joy of the Chinese people.

    Comrade Stalin's congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China stated: "On the occasion of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please accept my heartfelt congratulations, Comrade Chairman.

    I wish the Chinese people, the government of the People's Republic of China, and you personally new achievements in the construction of a strong people's democratic China.

    May the great friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics – a strong pillar of peace and security in the Far East and the world – be further consolidated and developed."

    The victory of the Chinese people's revolution is the most important event after the great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union and the Soviet victory in World War II.

    The victory of the Chinese revolution is another victory for Marxism-Leninism and a powerful demonstration of its great vitality.

    The Chinese revolution has fundamentally changed the destiny of China and has directed the lives of all Chinese people along a new path – the path of building a free and happy life. It has dealt another heavy blow to international imperialism – especially American imperialism. It has further strengthened the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. It has once again greatly inspired the national liberation movements of the colonial and dependent countries of the East.

    With the founding of the People's Republic of China, a large country that had suffered for decades from the plunder and exploitation of imperialist bandits from Europe, Japan, and the United States broke away from the capitalist system. Now China is building a new, free life, which once again tells the people of the East what great revolutionary cause a country that has mastered its own destiny and freed itself from the shackles and enslavement of imperialism can accomplish.

    The Chinese people, in close alliance and friendship with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, are confidently building their people's democratic state under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and their time-tested leader, Mao Zedong.

    In the three years of free life, the Chinese people have achieved great successes in building a new life and implementing fundamental social and economic reforms.

    The people's government of China has successfully solved the complex and difficult problem of land reform. Land reform is now nearing completion. This means that almost all the land in the country is now in the hands of the tillers.

    Great achievements have also been made in the restoration and development of industry, transportation, and finance. Prolonged inflation has been curbed, finance has been consolidated, and state budget revenues have exceeded expenditures – a first in Chinese history. Prices have been reduced.

    The economic recovery has created the conditions for transitioning to planned national economic development on the basis of industrialization, which will transform China from an agricultural country into an advanced industrial country and will lay the foundation for the transition to socialism. Under the initiative of the Chinese Communist Party, the first five-year plan for the development of the Chinese economy and culture is being drafted.

    The smooth economic recovery has enabled the people's government to gradually improve the material well-being and culture of the working people. The movement to eliminate illiteracy has been launched throughout the country.

    The historic achievements of the People's Republic of China in political power, economic and cultural development convincingly demonstrate the great vitality and strength of the people's democratic system, which is firmly supported by the people of the whole country.

    The growth of the People's Democratic China has enraged the American imperialists. They have ignited the flames of war in Korea, seized China's Taiwan Island, are re-fostering Japanese militarism, and are constantly provoking the Chinese people. Chinese reactionaries, supported and directed by foreign imperialists, are doing everything in their power to prevent the consolidation of the people's democratic system and the development of the economy and culture. However, the Chinese people remain highly vigilant, exposing and ruthlessly打击(da ji: strike, crack down on) the enemy's activities, uniting more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and their leader Mao Zedong, and intensifying their struggle for peace.

    The fraternal and selfless support and assistance of the Soviet Union has facilitated the development and consolidation of the People's Republic of China. The multifaceted assistance provided by the Soviet Union under the historic Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the common struggle of the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union for peace and international cooperation is a manifestation of a new relationship of friendship and equality, which is unheard of and impossible under the capitalist system, and can only exist between countries in the camp of democracy and socialism. The recent negotiations between the Soviet government and the delegation of the People's Republic of China are another manifestation of the growing friendship between the Soviet Union and China. The agreements reached in the negotiations demonstrate the untiring efforts of both sides to consolidate friendly relations for the benefit of peace and international security, and are also a major contribution to the cause of consolidating peace in the Far East and the world.

    On the occasion of the Chinese people's National Day - the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China - the Soviet people sincerely wish their friends and allies - the Chinese people - new victories in the cause of building a strong people's democratic country.

    May the great friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics - a strong pillar of peace and security in the Far East and the world - be further consolidated and developed!

    中国人民的伟大节日
    ——苏联“真理报”十月一日社论
    三年前，一九四九年十月一日，中华人民共和国宣告成立了。中国人民正在庆祝这个意义重大的日子——他们伟大的国庆节。
    全体苏联人民和所有进步人类也与中国人民同样感到欢欣。
    斯大林同志致中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛泽东主席的贺电说：“值此中华人民共和国成立三周年之际，主席同志，请您接受我衷心的祝贺。
    祝中国人民，中华人民共和国政府及您本人在强大的人民民主的中国国家之建设中获得新的成就。
    祝中华人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的伟大友谊——远东及全世界和平与安全的坚强支柱更加巩固和发展。”
    中国人民革命的胜利是苏联伟大的十月社会主义革命和苏联在第二次世界大战中获得胜利以后最重要的大事。
    中国革命的胜利是马克思主义—列宁主义的又一次胜利，是马克思主义—列宁主义的伟大生命力的有力证明。
    中国革命使中国的命运有了根本的改变，并使全体中国人民的生活沿着一条新的道路——建设自由而幸福的生活的道路——发展。它使国际帝国主义——首先是美帝国主义——遭到了又一次沉重的打击，它进一步加强了和平、民主与社会主义阵营，它又一次大大鼓舞了东方殖民地国家和附属国人民的民族解放运动。
    随着中华人民共和国的成立，一个数十年来备受欧洲、日本和美国的帝国主义强盗掠夺和剥削的大国脱离了资本主义体系。现在中国正在建设新的、自由的生活，这又一次告诉东方人民，一个掌握了自己的命运、摆脱了帝国主义枷锁和奴役的国家能够完成何等伟大的革命事业。
    中国人民与苏联和各人民民主国家的人民建立了密切的联盟和友谊，正在中国共产党和他们的久经考验的领袖毛泽东领导下满怀信心地建设自己的人民民主国家。
    在三年来的自由生活中，中国人民在建设新生活和实行根本的社会与经济改革方面获得了伟大的成就。
    中国的人民政权已经顺利地解决了像土地改革这样一个复杂困难的问题。现在土地改革已接近完成。这就是说现在全国的土地几乎已完全掌握在耕者手中。
    在工业、运输和财政的恢复和发展方面，也取得了伟大的成就。长时期的通货膨胀已被制止，财政已经巩固，国家预算的收入超过了支出——这在中国历史上还是第一次，物价已经减低。
    经济的恢复为在工业化的基础上过渡到计划中的国民经济发展创造了条件，工业化将使中国由一个农业国变为一个先进的工业国，并且将为过渡到社会主义打下基础。在中国共产党的倡议下，第一个发展中国经济与文化的五年计划正在草拟中。
    经济的顺利恢复使人民政权有可能逐步提高劳动人民的物质福利和文化。消灭文盲的运动已在全国各地展开。
    中华人民共和国在政权、经济和文化发展方面所获得的历史性成就，令人信服地证明了得到全国人民坚决拥护的人民民主制度的巨大活力和力量。
    人民民主中国的壮大，激怒了美帝国主义者。他们在朝鲜燃起了战争的火焰，霸占了中国的台湾岛，正在重新扶植日本军国主义，并不断向中国人民挑衅。受外国帝国主义者支持和指使的中国反动分子正在用全力阻止人民民主制度的巩固，阻止经济文化的发展。可是中国人民却保持着很高的警惕性，揭发并无情地打击着敌人的活动，更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和他们的领袖毛泽东的周围，加紧为和平而斗争。
    苏联兄弟般的无私的支持和帮助便利了中华人民共和国的发展和巩固。苏联根据具有历史意义的中苏友好同盟互助条约与中苏两大国家争取和平与国际合作的共同斗争所提供的多方面的援助，是一种新的友爱平等关系的表现，这种关系在资本主义制度下是听不到的，而且也是不可能的，只有在民主与社会主义阵营国家之间才会有这种关系。最近苏联政府与中华人民共和国政府代表团之间举行的谈判是苏中友谊日益增强的又一表现。在谈判过程中达成的协议表现出双方为巩固友好关系以利和平与国际安全而作的不疲倦的努力，同时也是对巩固远东与全世界和平的事业的一个重大贡献。
    值此中国人民的国庆节——中华人民共和国成立三周年——之际，苏联人民衷心地希望自己的朋友和同盟者——中国人民——在建设强大的人民民主国家的事业中获得新的胜利。
    祝中华人民共和国与苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟之间的伟大友谊——远东及全世界和平与安全的坚强支柱更加巩固和发展！
