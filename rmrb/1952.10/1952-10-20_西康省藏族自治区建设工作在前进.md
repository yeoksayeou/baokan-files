The Tibetan people and other ethnic groups in the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region, under the radiant light of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, have for the past two years adhered to the Common Program, implemented ethnic regional autonomy, and established people's governments at all levels in the autonomous region. The people's freedom of religious belief has been fully guaranteed, and their customs and habits respected.

The people's political power at all levels in the Tibetan Autonomous Region is established in accordance with the basic system of our country – the People's Representative Conference and the principle of democratic centralism. In the government committees of the Autonomous Region's People's Government and its subordinate 19 counties (excluding Luding County, where the Han population is larger, and a national democratic united government will be established), Tibetan members account for 97 percent. The main leaders and most of the staff of governments at all levels are minority ethnic cadres. In the past two years, people's representative conferences have been convened two to three times at all levels. The attendees include representatives from tuusi, headmen, sub-headmen, Living Buddhas, lamas, workers, farmers, herdsmen, business circles, cultural and educational circles, women, youth, and other patriotic figures. The representatives attending the upcoming third session of the Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Representative Conference in October include leaders from all walks of life and labor models in industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production, and their representativeness is even fuller.

The Autonomous Region People's Government's major measures are all determined in accordance with ethnic policies, after full consultation with the People's Representative Conference, and by concentrating the opinions of the majority of the people and their leaders. Therefore, all work has achieved good results. For example, the first session of the People's Representative Conference passed a resolution on strengthening ethnic unity, and in the past two years, a solid new relationship of unity, mutual assistance, friendship, and cooperation has been established among all ethnic groups. Discrimination, oppression, and disputes between ethnic groups have been fundamentally eliminated; disunity phenomena within ethnic groups, such as械斗（armed fights） and vendettas, are also rapidly being eliminated. Governments and people's representative conferences at all levels have mediated more than 3,000 major and minor, new and old disputes within ethnic groups in accordance with the unity resolution and the patriotic unity pact. Decades-old enemies have been reconciled, and many models of unity have emerged throughout the region. Social order is more stable than ever before, and some places have reached the point of "no one picks up lost items on the road, and doors are not locked at night."

After the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy and the realization of ethnic equality, developing production has become the most urgent demand of all ethnic groups. Therefore, the second session of the Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Representative Conference in 1951 listed the restoration and development of production as the central task of governments at all levels. Because the Tibetan people's original farming techniques and agricultural tools were relatively backward, the People's Government adopted measures in agricultural production such as providing farmers with interest-free grain loans and loans, vigorously organizing land reclamation, promoting the reform of agricultural tools, improving farming methods, and rewarding labor models. In the past two years, land reclamation has increased grain production by more than 2,000 tons. Through the construction of water conservancy projects, the improvement of agricultural tools and farming methods, the yield per unit area has generally increased. This year's spring crops increased by 17 percent compared with last year. The autumn harvest broke historical records. This year's agricultural production exceeded the original increase plan (2,000 tons) by more than 21 percent. The development of agricultural production has also allowed impoverished farmers who had fled and become homeless under the ethnic oppression system to return and rebuild their homes with the help of the People's Government. Measures to reward land reclamation have solved the land problems of some landless and land-deficient farmers. In the production campaign, the production enthusiasm of farmers of all ethnic groups has been unprecedentedly high, and more than 2,000 agricultural labor models have emerged. Some farmers have embarked on the road of "getting organized." Production units combining the army, production teams, and cadre schools are also being created. They have now reclaimed more than 5,700 mu of land. The new-style horse-drawn agricultural implements of the state-owned Qianning Agricultural and Pastoral Experimental Farm, established in 1951, have aroused the strong interest of Tibetan farmers. When these new-style agricultural implements are widely adopted by the broad masses of farmers, they will accelerate the development of agricultural production in the Tibetan Autonomous Region.

Animal husbandry accounts for a large proportion of the lives of the people in the autonomous region. The population of purely pastoral areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas accounts for more than 82 percent of the region's total population. In the past, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' cruel exploitation of the "Ula" (corvée) system and the instability of social order, the broad masses of herdsmen lived in dire straits, and animal husbandry was gradually declining. After liberation, the People's Government abolished the reactionary "Ula" system and adopted a positive restoration policy under the goal of "both people and livestock prospering." Animal husbandry has now made initial progress. In 1951, when rinderpest was prevalent in the northern region, the People's Government organized a strong veterinary epidemic prevention agency, and more than 200,000 head of livestock were quarantined, inoculated, inspected, and treated, quickly eradicating rinderpest and protecting the health of the cattle herds. In addition, livestock in various places have increased due to the gradual improvement of feeding methods, the establishment of a scientific pasture rotation system, and the development of mass grass storage campaigns. With the development of transportation and the increase in herdsmen's income, the lives of the people in pastoral areas have been initially improved.

Another important aspect of developing agricultural and animal husbandry production and improving the lives of all ethnic groups is the correct implementation of ethnic trade policies and the vigorous development of ethnic trade. In the past two years, thanks to the active assistance of state-owned trade organizations, commerce in the Tibetan region, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, has gradually embarked on the road of serving the broad masses of the Tibetan people and serving production. In particular, state-owned trade organizations serving the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production have been gradually established, changing the serious unequal exchange phenomenon of unscrupulous merchants in the past, promoting the development of production, and narrowing the price scissors difference between industrial, agricultural, and pastoral products. The purchasing power of all ethnic groups has been greatly increased. Local and special products in the Tibetan region, which had no sales for many years, have also developed, accounting for more than 20 percent of the total income of all ethnic groups. The prices of general local and special products have increased by one to two times compared with the past, and the trade department has expanded the varieties of local and special product purchases by more than 50 types, opening up avenues for the income of all ethnic groups. The prices of industrial products have been greatly reduced. Taking tea, a necessity for the lives of the people in the Tibetan region, as an example, the current price in some places is only one-eighth of that before liberation. The development of trade has played a positive role in improving the economic lives of all ethnic groups in the Tibetan Autonomous Region.

With the restoration and development of the economy, cultural and educational undertakings have also gradually developed. People of all ethnic groups automatically demand to run schools, and some even automatically build school buildings and purchase school supplies, requesting the People's Government to send teachers. At present, the number of primary schools has increased to 80, with more than 7,000 students, an increase of three and a half times compared with 1950. There is one middle school with more than 280 students, and the proportion of minority ethnic students is increasing year by year. More than 220 children of all ethnic groups have entered kindergartens and nurseries. In terms of social education, film screenings, radio listening, cultural centers, spare-time schools, and winter schools are also being promoted and organized in key areas. The Tibetan Autonomous Region Ethnic School and short-term training courses in various counties are specialized institutions for training minority ethnic cadres. More than 2,700 ethnic cadres have now graduated and taken up different work positions.

In addition to other reasons, an important factor in the rapid development of cultural and educational undertakings in the Tibetan Autonomous Region is that the People's Government respects and develops the languages and scripts of all ethnic groups. The People's Government constantly criticizes the tendency to ignore ethnic languages and scripts and to disregard ethnic forms. Textbooks in Tibetan primary schools are all in Tibetan; middle schools list Tibetan language and literature as one of the main subjects; and Tibetan language and literature teachers are specially trained. Government documents are issued in both Tibetan and Chinese, and Han cadres are encouraged to learn Tibetan language and literature, while Tibetan cadres and students learn Chinese language and literature completely on a voluntary basis. This has played an important role in the exchange and development of ethnic cultures.

The health cause has achieved remarkable results. Health centers have been established in all counties, and there are mobile medical teams. The Central Ethnic Health Brigade sent by the Central People's Government has been warmly welcomed by all ethnic groups. Entire families bring tents and food and travel for several days or more than ten days to seek treatment from the Central Ethnic Health Brigade. In the past two years, a total of more than 222,800 initial and follow-up diagnoses and treatments have been conducted, more than 83,600 people have been vaccinated, more than 14,300 people have received preventive injections, and more than 300 primary health workers from minority ethnic groups have been trained. In accordance with the resolutions of the Central Ethnic Health Conference, treatment work has begun for syphilis and venereal diseases, which have been the most harmful to all ethnic groups in the Tibetan region. The new method of midwifery is also being promoted in key areas. This area, inhabited mainly by Tibetans, a minority ethnic group whose population has been declining for hundreds of years, will flourish due to the development of health undertakings.

The people of all ethnic groups in the Tibetan Autonomous Region deeply understand that they can have everything today "only because we have Chairman Mao" and "only because we have our own great motherland of all ethnic groups." Therefore, when American imperialism invaded Korea and occupied our country's Taiwan at the same time, patriotic movements to resist America and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend our country were launched everywhere in rural areas, pastures, cities, villages, and lama temples. People of all ethnic groups signed the Stockholm Appeal, enthusiastically supported the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, and actively participated in peace movements against American imperialism's arming of Japan and against American imperialism's launching of bacteriological warfare. In the movement to donate weapons, they completed the plan for the "Tibetan" anti-aircraft gun ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, and victoriously completed the sacred task of supporting the peaceful advance into Tibet and consolidating national defense. The political consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups in the Tibetan Autonomous Region has been universally enhanced, and their patriotic enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high.

The achievements of the past two years are hard to imagine without Chairman Mao's ethnic policies and the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy. The poverty, backwardness, and weakness of the Tibetan Autonomous Region and its people for hundreds of years are changing every day. The face of the Tibetan Autonomous Region is undergoing tremendous changes. In the future, the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, and with the help of the Han people, will rapidly move towards a brighter and happier road along with the victory of the construction of the great motherland.

The current important tasks of the Tibetan Autonomous Region are: First, to advance the patriotic production increase and economy campaign further. Vigorously lead and organize people of all ethnic groups to carry out competitions to increase production and increase livestock, develop agricultural and animal husbandry production, and combine it with the development of the patriotic health movement. Second, conscientiously implement the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China" and strengthen the construction of people's political power at all levels in the autonomous region. Third, universally organize people of all ethnic groups to study Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, further enhance the patriotic and internationalist thinking of people of all ethnic groups in the Tibetan region, continue to criticize and overcome the remnants of nationalism, strengthen political and ideological leadership and the political and theoretical study of cadres of all ethnic groups, improve the theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism; conduct in-depth investigations and studies of the Tibetan autonomous situation, systematically summarize work experience, and better combine Chairman Mao's, the Communist Party's, and the Central People's Government's ethnic policies and other policies with the actual situation of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, so that all aspects of work can continue to improve.

    西康省藏族自治区建设工作在前进
    中共康定地委书记  苗逢澍
    西康省藏族自治区的藏族人民及其他各族人民在毛主席民族政策的光辉照耀下，两年来遵循着共同纲领，实行了民族区域自治，建立了自治区各级人民政府。人民的宗教信仰获得了充分自由，风俗习惯受到尊重。
    藏族自治区各级人民政权是按照我们国家的基本制度——人民代表会议及民主集中制的原则建立的。自治区人民政府及其所属十九县（泸定县除外，该县汉族人民较多，将建立民族民主联合政府）的县、区人民政府的政府委员会中，藏族委员占百分之九十七。各级人民政府主要负责人及多数工作人员都是由少数民族干部充任。两年来，各级人民政府都召开了二次到三次人民代表会议。出席会议的包括土司、头人、支头、活佛、喇嘛、工人、农民、牧民、工商界、文教界、妇女、青年以及其他爱国人士中的代表人物。出席今年十月间即将召开的藏族自治区第三届人民代表会议的代表，包括各阶层的领袖人物及工农牧业生产中的劳动模范，其代表性更加充分。
    自治区人民政府的各项重大措施，都是按照民族政策，经过人民代表会议充分协商，集中大多数人民及其领袖人物的意见而决定的。因而各项工作都收到了良好的成就。如该区第一届人民代表会议曾通过了关于加强民族团结的决议，两年来已在各民族之间建立了巩固的团结和互助友爱合作的新关系。民族间的歧视、压迫和纠纷现象已根本消除；民族内部的械斗、打冤家等不团结现象也在迅速消除。各级人民政府和人民代表会议根据团结决议和团结爱国公约，调解了民族内部的大小新旧纠纷三千多件，数十年的冤家对头也重新和睦起来，各地都涌现出不少团结模范。社会秩序空前安定，某些地方达到“路不拾遗，夜不闭户”的地步。
    在实行民族区域自治、实现民族平等权利以后，发展生产便成了各族人民最迫切的要求。因而一九五一年藏族自治区第二届人民代表会议把恢复和发展生产列为各级人民政府的中心任务。因为藏族人民原有耕作技术和农具比较落后，人民政府在农业生产上采取了给农民无利贷粮、贷款，大力组织开荒，提倡改革农具、改良耕作方法和奖励劳动模范等措施。两年来开荒增产粮食二千余吨。经过兴修水利、改良农具和耕作方法等，单位面积产量一般均有提高。今年小春作物较去年增产百分之十七。秋收突破了历史纪录。今年的农业生产，超过了原增产计划（二千吨）百分之二十一强。农业生产的发展，使过去在民族压迫制度下逃亡在外无家可归的贫苦农民，也经过人民政府的帮助，纷纷返回，重建家园。奖励开荒的措施，解决了部分无地缺地农民的土地问题。在生产运动中，各族农民的生产情绪空前高涨，涌现出二千多名农业劳动模范，部分农民并走上了“组织起来”的道路。军队、生产队和干部学校三者相结合的生产部队，也正在创建中，现已开荒五千七百多亩，一九五一年建立起来的国营乾宁农牧试验场的新式马拉农具，已引起藏族农民的浓厚兴趣。当这种新式农具被广大农民群众普遍采用时，将加速藏族自治区的农业生产的发展。
    畜牧业在自治区人民生活中，占了很大比重。纯牧区和半农半牧区的人口约占全区人口的百分之八十二强。过去由于国民党反动派“乌拉”（差役）制度的残酷剥削和社会秩序的不安定，广大牧民群众生活在水深火热中，畜牧事业日渐萎缩。解放后人民政府取消了反动的“乌拉”制度，在“人畜两旺”的目标下，采取了积极恢复的方针。畜牧事业现在已经有了初步发展。一九五一年北部地区牛瘟流行，人民政府组织了强大的兽疫防治机构，经过防疫、注射、检查和治疗的牲畜达二十余万头，迅速扑灭了牛瘟，保护了牛群健康。另外，由于逐步地改善了饲养方法，建立了科学的牧草轮放制度，并开展了群众性的储草运动，各地牲畜已都有增加。加以运输事业发展，牧民收入增多，牧区人民生活已获得初步改善。
    发展农牧业生产，改善各族人民生活的另一个重要方面，是正确执行了民族贸易政策，大力发展了民族贸易事业。两年来由于国营贸易机构的积极帮助，藏区商业在国营经济领导下、已逐渐走上面向藏族广大人民群众、为生产服务的道路。尤其是逐步建立了为发展农牧业生产服务的国营贸易机构，改变了过去不法商人的严重不等价交换现象，促进了生产事业的发展，缩小了工农牧业生产品价格的剪刀差额。各族人民的购买力已大大提高。多年无销路的藏区土、特产品也发展起来，占了各族人民总收入的百分之二十以上。一般土、特产价格较前提高了一倍到两倍，贸易部门并扩大了五十多种土特产收购品种。给各族人民的收入开辟了道路。工业品的价格则大大地降低了。单以藏区人民生活必需品的茶叶计算，有的地方，目前的价格只等于解放前的八分之一。贸易工作的发展对改善藏族自治区各族人民的经济生活起了积极的作用。
    随着经济的恢复和发展，文化教育事业也逐步发展起来。各族人民自动要求办学校，甚至有的自动修建校舍和购买学校用具，请人民政府派遣教师。目前小学校已发展到八十所，有学生七千余人，较一九五零年增加三倍半。中等学校一所，学生二百八十多人，少数民族学生比例逐年增加。各族儿童二百二十多人已进入幼儿园和保育院。社会教育方面，如放映电影、收听广播、文化馆、业余学校和冬学也在重点推广和举办中。藏族自治区民族学校及各县短期训练班为培养少数民族干部的专门机构，现已有二千七百多名民族干部结业，走上了不同的工作岗位。
    藏族自治区文化教育事业的迅速发展，除其他原因外，重要的一条是人民政府尊重和发展各民族的语言文字。人民政府时刻批判忽视民族语言文字和不重视民族形式的偏向。藏民小学校的课本全用藏文；中等学校把藏语文列为主科之一；并专门培养了藏语文师资。政府中公文行使藏汉两文，提倡和鼓励汉族干部学习藏文藏语，藏族干部和学生完全在自愿原则下学习汉文汉语。这对民族文化的交流和发展，起了重要的作用。
    卫生事业有显著成绩。各县都已建立了卫生院，并有巡回医疗组织。中央人民政府派来的中央民族卫生大队，受到各族人民的热烈欢迎，有全家人带上帐棚和食粮走数日或十多日的路程找中央民族卫生大队治病的。两年来总共初诊复诊二十二万二千八百多次，种痘八万三千六百多人，预防注射一万四千三百多人，并培养出少数民族初级卫生人员三百余名。对于藏区各族人民为害最深的梅毒性病，已根据中央民族卫生会议的决议，开始了治疗工作。新法接生也在重点推广。这个数百年来人口一直下降的以藏族为主体的少数民族聚居区域，将因卫生事业的发展而人口兴旺起来。
    藏族自治区各族人民深刻地懂得，能有今日的一切，“只因为我们有了毛主席”，“只因为我们有了各族人民自己的伟大祖国”。所以当美帝国主义侵略朝鲜同时侵占我国台湾的时候，在农村、牧场、城市、乡村和喇嘛寺庙，到处展开了抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义运动。各族人民在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，热烈拥护五大国缔结和平公约，积极参加反对美帝国主义武装日本、反对美帝国主义发动细菌战等和平运动。在捐献武器运动中，提前并超额完成了“藏族号”高射炮一门的计划，并胜利地完成了支援和平进军西藏、巩固国防的神圣任务。藏族自治区各族人民的政治觉悟已普遍提高，爱国主义热情空前高涨。
    两年来的成就，离开毛主席的民族政策和民族区域自治的实施，是很难想像的。藏族自治区人民数百年来贫困落后和衰弱的状况每天在改变着。藏族自治区的面貌正起着巨大的变化。今后藏族人民和藏族自治区各族人民将在毛主席、共产党和中央人民政府的英明领导下，经过汉族人民的帮助而伴随着伟大祖国建设的胜利，将迅速地走向更加光明幸福的道路。
    藏族自治区当前的重要任务是：第一、将爱国增产节约运动向前推进一步。大力领导和组织各族人民开展丰产增畜竞赛运动，发展农牧业生产，并结合开展爱国卫生运动。第二、认真贯彻“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”，加强自治区各级人民政权的建设工作。第三、普遍组织各族人民学习毛主席的民族政策，进一步提高藏区各族人民爱国主义与国际主义的思想，继续批判和克服民族主义思想残余，加强政治、思想领导和各民族干部的政治理论学习，提高马克思列宁主义理论水平；深入调查研究藏族自治情况，系统地总结工作经验，把毛主席、共产党和中央人民政府的民族政策和其他各项政策，更好地和藏族自治区的实际情况结合起来，使各方面工作继续提高。
