An editor's note: Our newspaper has received questions from readers in various locations regarding how agricultural taxes are reduced and exempted for disaster-stricken farmers. We are providing a comprehensive response below.

Q: What are the principles for reduction and exemption stipulated in the agricultural tax reduction and exemption measures for disaster-stricken farmers? What is its purpose?

A: The agricultural tax reduction and exemption measures for disaster-stricken farmers stipulate two principles: first, "light disasters, small reductions; heavy disasters, large reductions; very light, no reduction; very heavy, full exemption"; second, "for the same land and the same type of crops, suffering the same and equal degree of disaster, the same percentage of crop failure should be calculated. Those who actively fought the disaster and reduced the degree of disaster will still be calculated according to the same percentage of crop failure, and their reduction and exemption percentage will not be lowered; if the disaster is aggravated due to negligence in disaster relief, it should also be calculated according to the same percentage of crop failure, and their reduction percentage should not be increased." The former provision provides different reduction and exemption care according to the different degrees of disaster suffered by farmers, so as to avoid the impact of the agricultural tax burden on the lives and production of disaster-stricken farmers. The latter provision encourages disaster-stricken farmers to actively fight the disaster and reduce losses in agricultural production as much as possible. These provisions are fully in line with our agricultural production policy and agricultural tax policy.

Q: Why should the reduced production of both summer and autumn harvests be combined to calculate the annual crop failure percentage when determining the amount of reduction and exemption?

A: The levy of agricultural tax is calculated once a year based on the normal annual yield of all the land of the farmers. Therefore, the reduction and exemption for crop failure due to disasters must also be calculated according to the percentage of the total annual normal yield accounted for by the total annual crop failure of disaster-stricken farmers. Only in this way can it be adapted to the actual affordability of farmers and achieve fairness and reasonableness. If the reduced production of summer and autumn harvests are calculated separately for reduction and exemption, the following situation will occur: For example, the normal annual yield and total annual crop failure of two farmers are the same, but because the degree of disaster suffered by the two families' summer and autumn crops is different, the amount of tax reduction they should receive will be very different, some will suffer losses, and some will take advantage of it, which is unfair. For example, in a certain place, there are two farmers, A and B, with an agricultural population of five people each, and a normal annual yield of 5,000 catties. The proportion of summer and autumn yields for both families is 2,500 catties each, and the tax rate is 19%, and the annual tax payable is 950 catties. Assuming that the total annual crop failure for both families is 1,300 catties, but Farmer A's summer crop failed by 450 catties and the autumn crop failed by 850 catties, while Farmer B's summer crop failed by 1,300 catties and there was no disaster in the autumn. If calculated according to the method of reducing and exempting in the summer for summer crop failure and reducing and exempting in the autumn for autumn crop failure, then Farmer A's summer crop failure is 18%, which is not reduced according to the law, and the autumn crop failure is 34%, which should be reduced by 35% of the autumn tax of 475 catties (according to the proportion of summer and autumn yields to the annual normal yield to determine the summer and autumn tax ratio, the same below), that is, a tax reduction of 166.25 catties; Farmer B's summer crop failure is 52%, which should be reduced by 70% of the summer tax of 475 catties according to the law, that is, a reduction of 332.5 catties. According to the above situation, the total annual crop failure percentage of the two households is the same, and the affordability is also equal, but the amount of tax reduction differs by a factor of two, which is unreasonable; If the total annual crop failure is calculated together and reduced and exempted at one time, then the total annual crop failure of the two families is 1,300 catties, accounting for 26% of the normal annual yield, both are fifth-class disaster households, and should be reduced by 25% of the tax amount according to the law, and the same tax reduction of 237.5 catties. In this way, the actual burden of the two households will be completely balanced. This shows that it is reasonable to calculate the crop failure percentage on an annual combined basis and carry out reduction and exemption.

Q: How to calculate the crop failure percentage and the amount of tax reduction?

A: 1. The method for calculating the crop failure percentage is to divide the total normal annual yield of the disaster-stricken farmers by the total yield failure of the household due to disasters, and the quotient is the crop failure percentage.

2. According to the crop failure percentage, find the reduction percentage in Article 3 of the measures and multiply it by the household's total annual tax payable to calculate the household's total annual tax reduction.

For example: Zhang San has a total of ten mu of land. Assume that the normal annual yield per mu is 100 catties, and the total normal annual yield is 1,000 catties; also assume that the household's total annual tax payable is 100 catties. This year, seven mu of Zhang San's ten mu of land were affected by the disaster. Calculated by block, there are three mu in the east of the village and four mu in the west of the village that were affected by the disaster. After investigation and evaluation by the township (village) agricultural tax investigation and evaluation committee, it was determined that the three mu in the east of the village could produce 180 catties after being affected by the disaster, with a crop failure of 120 catties; the four mu in the west of the village could produce 160 catties after being affected by the disaster, with a crop failure of 240 catties; Zhang San's total crop failure this year is 360 catties. The crop failure percentage is: 360 catties ÷ 1,000 catties = 36% (that is, a crop failure of 36%). Then, according to Article 3 of the measures, it is found that a crop failure of 36% is a fourth-class disaster household, and 35% of the household's total annual tax payable should be reduced. The household's total annual tax payable is 100 catties, so the tax reduction should be: 100 catties × 35% = 35 catties, and Zhang San's actual tax payment should be: 100 catties - 35 catties = 65 catties.

Q: If farmers actively fight the disaster and the land yield can reach the normal annual yield level after the disaster, should the agricultural tax be reduced or exempted? If farmers increase their investment in disaster relief, how should they be taken care of?

A: In the same area, farmers with the same land, planting the same type of crops, and suffering the same and equal degree of disaster should be calculated according to the same crop failure percentage. Those who actively fought the disaster should not have their agricultural tax reduced less, and those who were negligent in disaster relief should not have their agricultural tax reduced more. This is completely in line with the spirit of encouraging disaster relief. If, in a large area, farmers have actively fought the disaster and their harvest has reached the normal annual yield, and it is difficult to find a certain crop failure percentage, it will be difficult to carry out universal disaster reduction and exemption. However, it is also a fact that farmers have increased their investment in disaster relief. In order to take care of the actual difficulties of these farmers, they can be given appropriate reductions and exemptions on a case-by-case basis after evaluation.

Q: Why issue reduction and exemption certificates?

A: Issuing reduction and exemption certificates so that disaster-stricken farmers and farmers enjoying other reduction and exemption preferential treatment can use the certificates to offset the agricultural tax they should pay is to promote the reduction and exemption work to institutionalization, so that the work of compiling books, calculating the tax payable, etc. can be carried out on time without being affected by each other. That is, in order to enable the work of calculating and levying taxes according to rates to be carried out simultaneously and separately from the work of investigating disaster conditions and verifying reductions and exemptions, without delaying each other. The advantage of this method is that the procedures are simple and the execution is convenient.

In order to do a good job in reduction and exemption, the evaluation work must be done well before the levy. After review by the district and county, and approved by the county, the reduction and exemption certificates are filled out and issued to disaster-stricken farmers and farmers who should enjoy other reduction and exemption preferential treatment together with the tax payment notice before the autumn levy. The farmers use the certificates to offset the tax amount to the designated granary or agency. This method can not only eliminate the concerns of farmers about heavy burdens due to disasters, and enable them to quickly hand in grain to the warehouse, but also is better than the methods of "collecting first and then reducing and exempting" or "collecting while reducing and exempting" in terms of implementing levy according to rates and reducing and exempting according to law, and it is easier to achieve a fair and reasonable burden.

Q: How to do a good job in agricultural tax reduction and exemption work?

A: The prerequisite for doing a good job in agricultural tax reduction and exemption is to master the basic principles and calculation methods of the agricultural tax reduction and exemption measures for disaster-stricken farmers. In the past, some deviations occurred in the agricultural tax reduction and exemption work in some areas, the most common of which was the deviation of "reduction and exemption contracting". This means that regardless of the actual disaster situation, the amount of reduction and exemption is allocated at each level, and the amount of reduction and exemption is contracted at each level. The result is that the reduction and exemption are inappropriate: those who should be reduced are not reduced, those who should be reduced more are reduced less, or those who should not be reduced are reduced more. In addition, some cadres in some areas exaggerated the disaster situation and reduced and exempted equally in the past when implementing the reduction and exemption work; some concealed the disaster and did not dare to reduce and exempt according to law. These phenomena have caused losses to the work to varying degrees and produced a deviation of excessively light or heavy agricultural tax burdens. In the future, they must be seriously corrected.

    受灾农户为什么减免农业税？怎样减免农业税？
    编者按：本报先后收到各地读者提出的关于
    受灾农民的农业税怎样减免的问题，现综合答复如下。
    问：受灾农户农业税减免办法中所规定的减免原则是什么？它的目的为何？
    答：受灾农户农业税减免办法中规定了两个原则：一是“轻灾少减，重灾多减，特轻不减，特重全免”；一是“同等土地、同类作物，遭受同样和同等程度的灾害，应按同一歉收成数计算。其因积极抗灾而减轻受灾程度者，仍照同一歉收成数计算，不降低其减免成数；如因怠于抗灾而致灾情加重者，亦应照同一歉收成数计算，不提高其减征成数”。前项规定是按照农户受灾程度之不同，而给与不同的减免照顾，以免受灾农户因农业税负担而影响其生活和生产。后一项规定是鼓励受灾农户积极抗灾，尽可能减少农业生产上的损失。这些规定是完全符合我们的农业生产政策和农业税收政策的。
    问：为什么在确定减免数额时，要合并夏秋两季歉收产量来计算全年歉收成数？
    答：农业税的征收，是根据农户全部土地的常年应产量全年一次计算的。因此，对因灾歉收的减免，也必须按照受灾农户全年全部因灾歉收的产量所占全年常年应产量的成数来计算。只有这样，才能够适应农民实际负担能力，达到公平合理。如果把夏秋两季的歉收产量分开计算减免，就会出现如下的情况：例如，两个农户的常年应产量和全年歉收产量是一样的，但因为两家夏、秋作物受灾程度不同，其应减税额就会有很大的差别，有的吃了亏，有的占了便宜，这是不公平的。如某地有甲乙两农户，农业人口都是五口人，常年应产量都是五千斤，两家的夏、秋产量比例都是各占二千五百斤，税率都是百分之十九，全年应征税额都是九百五十斤。假定两家全年因灾歉收产量同为一千三百斤，但甲户是夏季歉收四百五十斤，秋季歉收八百五十斤，乙户是夏季歉收一千三百斤，秋季无灾。如按夏季歉收夏季减免，秋季歉收秋季减免的办法计算，则甲户夏季歉收一成八，依法不减，秋季歉收三成四，依法应减秋征税额四百七十五斤（按夏、秋产量占全年常年应产量的比例，定夏、秋分征比例，下同）的三成五，即减征税额一百六十六点二五斤；乙户夏季歉收五成二，依法应减夏征税额四百七十五斤的七成，即减征三百三十二点五斤。按上述情形来讲，两户全年歉收成数是一样的，负担能力也是相等的，但所减税额却相差一倍，这是不合理的；如全年歉收产量合并计算，一次减免，则两家全年全部歉收产量一千三百斤，同占常年应产量的二成六，同为五等灾户，依法均应减税额的二成五，同样减征税额二百三十七点五斤，这样，两户的实际负担便完全平衡了。由此说明全年合并计算歉收成数，进行减免，才是合理的。
    问：怎样计算歉收成数和应减税额？
    答：一、计算歉收成数的方法是受灾农户的全部常年应产量除该户因灾歉收的全部产量，其商数即为歉收成数。
    二、根据歉收成数在办法第三条中查出其应减成数与该户全年应交税额相乘，即可算出该户全年应减税额。
    例如：张三共有十亩地，假定每亩常年应产量均为一百斤，全部常年应产量为一千斤；又假定该户全年应交税额为一百斤。今年张三在十亩地中有七亩地受了灾，按块计算，受灾的村东有三亩，村西有四亩，经由乡（村）农业税调查评议委员会调查评议确定村东的三亩地受灾后可产一八○斤，计歉收一二○斤；村西的四亩地受灾后可产一六○斤，计歉收二四○斤；张三今年共歉收三六○斤。其歉收成数为：三百六十斤÷一千斤＝百分之三十六
    （即歉收三成六）。再根据办法第三条，查出歉收三成六为四等灾户，应减征该户全年应交税额的三成半，该户全年应交税额为一百斤，所以应减税额为：一百斤×百分之三十五＝三十五斤，张三实交税额应为：一百斤－三十五斤＝六十五斤。
    问：农民由于积极抗灾，受灾后土地产量可达到常年应产量水平，是否减免农业税？农民因抗灾增加的投资很多，应如何加以照顾？
    答：在同一地区内，有同等土地，种植同类作物，遭受同样和同等程度灾害之农户，应按同一歉收成数计算，其中积极抗灾者不能少减农业税，怠于抗灾者不能多减农业税，这是完全符合鼓励抗灾的精神的。如在大面积内，农民由于积极抗灾，其收获已达常年产量，找不出一定的歉收成数，就很难进行普遍的灾歉减免，但农户因抗灾增多了投资，也是事实，为了照顾这些农户的实际困难，可以按个别情况，经过评议，酌予减免。
    问：为什么要发减免证？
    答：填发减免证，使受灾农户及享受其他减免优待的农户持证抵交其应纳农业税额，是为了把减免工作推向制度化，使编册造串、计算应征税额等项工作均能依时进行，相互不受影响。也就是为了使依率计征的工作，能与调查灾情、核定减免等工作，同时分头进行，两不耽误。这种办法的好处是手续简单，执行方便。
    为了作好减免工作，必须在征收前作好评议工作，经区、县审查，由县批准后填写减免证，连同纳税通知书，在秋征前同时发给受灾农户及应享受其他减免优待的农户，由农民持证向指定粮库或机关抵交税额。这种办法，不但可以解除农民因灾怕负担重的顾虑，使他们迅速交粮入库，并且在贯彻依率计征、依法减免方面，比“先征收后减免”或“边征收边减免”的方法好，容易作到负担公平合理。
    问：如何把农业税减免工作作好？
    答：作好农业税减免工作的先决条件是掌握受灾农户农业税减免办法的基本原则与其计算方法。过去有些地区的农业税减免工作曾经发生过一些偏向，其中最普遍的是“减免包干”的偏向。这就是不管实际灾情如何，逐级分配减免数额，逐级把减免数额包下来。其结果是减免不当：应减者不减，应多减者少减，或不应减者多减。另外，还有一些地区的干部，过去在执行减免工作中，有的夸大灾情、平均减免；也有的匿灾不报，不敢依法减免。这些现象，都曾或大或小地使工作遭受损失，产生农业税负担上畸轻畸重的偏向，今后必须认真加以纠正。
