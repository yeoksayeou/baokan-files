    Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Regarding the crimes of Shiro Ishii, the head Japanese bacteriological war criminal and commander of Unit 731 of the former Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in China, in conducting bacteriological warfare in China during World War II, new evidence has been obtained from the recent investigation of files and archives of the puppet Manchukuo Longjiang Province Japanese puppet reactionary government by the Northeast People's Government of China. In 1945, Shiro Ishii, under the name of the commander of Unit 659 (the general number of the headquarters of Unit 731 and its subordinate detachments), forced the people of Northeast China to hand over 300,000 susliks (Citellus dauricus), in order to breed and cultivate one to two tons of fleas carrying plague bacteria, in preparation for large-scale bacteriological warfare endangering the people of China and the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world.

    In the investigation of files and archives of the puppet Manchukuo Longjiang Province Japanese puppet reactionary government, documents from Ishii Shiro, commander of the Manchukuo Unit 659, and Inagaki Yukio, vice minister of the puppet Manchukuo Ministry of Agriculture, to the vice governor of Longjiang Province were discovered. On February 12, 1945, Ishii Shiro issued document "Manfang Jingyi 173" to the vice governor of Longjiang Province to discuss the collection of susliks, along with a written document and plan. Article 4 of the "Implementation Guidelines" in the document stipulates the following regarding the collection of susliks: "Agreements regarding the supply from each province (provinces under the puppet Manchukuo) shall be made by the commander of Unit 659, and agreements regarding the supply from each county and banner shall be made by the manager of Unit 659." On February 26 and March 18 of the same year, Inagaki Yukio, vice minister of the puppet Manchukuo Ministry of Agriculture, twice issued official letter "No. 12 Lin Xin Tan 25" to the vice governor of the puppet Longjiang Province, notifying him to collect susliks according to the "Collection Guidelines," proposing a total demand of 300,000 live susliks within 1945, designated to be purchased by the Xingnong Cooperatives in villages and settlements of each county and banner, and sent to Unit 659; and decided that the Kyowa Youth Corps (a youth organization affiliated with the puppet Manchukuo Kyowa Kai, used by the Japanese invaders) would assist in this work. Longjiang, Tailai, Fuyu, Nehe and other counties in Longjiang Province were designated to collect 50,000 susliks, to be completed from May 25 to June 30. On March 18, the official letter from the vice minister of the puppet Ministry of Agriculture to the vice governor of the puppet Longjiang Province indicated that this official letter was also issued to the vice governors of the puppet Siping, Fengtian, Binjiang, Beian, and Jinzhou provinces.

    In the files and archives, a draft of the "Agreement on Supplying Military Susliks" concluded on April 1 of the same year between Ishii Shiro and Matsushima Akira, chairman of the central association of the puppet Manchukuo Xingnong Cooperative, was also discovered. This agreement was concluded based on the consultation regarding this matter at the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army on February 24, 1945, stipulating that national schools near railway lines would be responsible for catching mice, cooperative societies at each station would purchase them, and they would be directly handed over to the Japanese army. The agreement was sent to the vice governor of the puppet Longjiang Province on April 2, and again designated Longjiang, Tailai, Fuyu, Nehe and other counties in Longjiang Province to collect 50,000 susliks, to be completed from May 25 to June 30. The archive also included the number of mice allocated to each county by Longjiang Province.

    When Unit 659 collected susliks from various places, it generally used schools as a base. Female students of Yayoi National Girls' High School (now Dalian No. 1 Middle School) in Dalian City were forced to go out to "serve the public" to catch mice in May 1945. The school was also occupied by the Japanese Kwantung Army to raise mice, and students were forced to catch fleas for the mice. At that time, each puppet police station in Dalian City also had a mouse collection box dedicated to collecting susliks for the Japanese army. More than 15,000 elementary school students in Anda County were also forced to catch mice in the wild all day long and send the mice to Jujiayao and the airport. In Qing'an, Shenyang, Liaoyang, Changchun, Jinzhou, Harbin, Haicheng and other places, mice were also collected from street households based on schools. Regardless of university, middle school, or elementary school, each student had to submit two cc of blood powder (for cultivating bacteria), one suslik, and one rat at a time. Many students were convicted of "ideological impurity" and "anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese" if they could not catch mice or complete the task as required. Those who could not submit blood powder or mice were considered to have failed the "National Morality" course, and were even forced to substitute themselves for mice, or use human blood to make blood powder.

    The crimes of head bacteriological war criminal Shiro Ishii have long been hated by the people of China and the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world. However, today this heinous war criminal is being harbored and reused by American imperialism, and is helping American imperialism to carry out large-scale bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this inhuman and monstrous crime of American imperialism.

    关于日本头号细菌战犯石井四郎在我国进行细菌战罪行
    我东北人民政府又查获新的证据
    【新华社十一日讯】日本头号细菌战犯前日寇驻华关东军七三一部队长官石井四郎于第二次世界大战期间在我国进行细菌战争的罪行，从最近我国东北人民政府清查伪满龙江省日伪反动政府的文件档案中又得到了新的证据。石井四郎在一九四五年曾以六五九（七三一部队本部及下属各支队的总番号）部队长的名义，强逼东北人民交纳黄鼠（大眼贼）三十万只，以便繁殖培育带有鼠疫菌的跳蚤一吨至二吨，准备大规模地进行危害中苏两国人民及世界和平人民的细菌战争。
    在清查伪满龙江省日伪反动政府的文件档案中，发现有满洲六五九部队长石井四郎及伪满洲国兴农部次长给龙江省次长的文稿。一九四五年二月十二日石井四郎向龙江省次长发出“满防经一七三”号商讨搜集黄鼠的书面文件和计划书。该文件“实施要领”章第四条对于征集黄鼠的规定为：“关于各省（伪满所属省份）供应之协定由第六五九部队长行之，关于各县、旗供应之协定由第六五九部队经理课长行之。”同年二月二十六日和三月十八日，伪满洲国兴农部次长稻垣征夫两次发出“第一二林薪炭二十五号”公函给伪龙江省次长，通知按照“搜集要领”搜集黄鼠，提出在一九四五年内共需活的黄鼠三十万只，指定由各县、旗的村屯中的兴农合作社负责收买，送交六五九部队；并决定由协和青少年团（为日寇御用的伪满协和会下属的青少年团体）协助此项工作。指定龙江省的龙江、泰来、富裕、讷河等县搜集黄鼠五万只，限自五月二十五日至六月三十日完成。伪兴农部次长三月十八日给伪龙江省次长的公函上，标明这一公函也发给了伪四平、奉天、滨江、北安、锦州各省次长。
    在文件档案中，并发现在同年四月一日石井四郎与伪满洲国兴农合作社中央会理事长松岛鉴所订立的“供应军用黄鼠协定书”的文稿。该协定书是根据一九四五年二月二十四日在日寇关东军司令部关于此事之协商而订立的，规定由铁路线附近的国民学校负责捕鼠，由各车站合作社收买，并直接交给日军。该协定书于四月二日即送给伪龙江省次长，同样指定龙江省的龙江、泰来、富裕、讷河等县搜集黄鼠五万只，限自五月二十五日至六月三十日完成。在档案中并有龙江省分配给各县的捕鼠数字。
    六五九部队向各地征集黄鼠时，一般多是以学校为基点。大连市弥生国民女子高等学校（现大连第一中学）的女学生，在一九四五年五月间，被迫出外“奉公”捕鼠。该校亦被日本关东军占用饲养老鼠，并强迫学生给老鼠抓跳蚤。当时大连市的每个伪警察派出所也都设有收鼠箱，专为日军搜集黄鼠。安达县全县一万五千多个小学生也被迫整天到野外去捉老鼠，并将老鼠送到鞠家窑和飞机场。在庆安、沈阳、辽阳、长春、锦州、哈尔滨、海城等地，也都是以学校为基点按街户搜集老鼠的。不论大学、中学、小学，每个学生一次要缴二西西血粉（用血粉培育细菌）、一只大眼贼、一只老鼠。很多学生因为捉不到老鼠或是不能如数完成任务，就被以“思想不良”和“反满抗日”论罪。有的不能交上血粉或老鼠，就被认为“国民道德”课程不及格，甚至被迫以身代鼠，或以人血做血粉。
    头号细菌战犯石井四郎的罪行，早已为中苏两国人民和世界一切爱好和平的人们所痛恨。但是，今天这个罪大恶极的战犯却被美帝国主义所窝藏和重用，并帮助美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北进行大规模的细菌战争。我国人民坚决反对美帝国主义这种灭绝人性的滔天罪行。
