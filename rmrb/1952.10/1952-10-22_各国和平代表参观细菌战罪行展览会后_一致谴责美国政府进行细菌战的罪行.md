Xinhua News Agency Report: One hundred and twenty representatives from various countries attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference visited the "Exhibition of Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by the US Government" organized by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace on the 17th.

These 120 representatives came from 23 different countries and four international organizations. Some came from Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Thailand in Southeast Asia; some came from Cyprus in the Mediterranean, as well as Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, and Syria in the Middle East and Near East; and many representatives came from Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, and Peru on the distant American continent. The other four were representatives of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, the International Union of Students, and the International Organization of Journalists. Prior to this, representatives from the United States and other countries had also visited the exhibition.

Medical workers cannot help but feel the greatest indignation at bacteriological warfare. They dedicate their energy to relieving human diseases and suffering, but the American imperialists spread disease and death. Duqinqi, the Burmese representative and chairman of the Yangon Women's Welfare Association, who is also an obstetrician, wrote: "...I saw the barbaric acts launched by the American imperialists against Korea and China. As a doctor, I think this is an extremely inhumane act. American imperialism dares not fight face to face, but cowardly uses bacteria to kill people. Burmese and Buddhist customs consider this an unforgivable crime. ...We must unite our strength and unite all the people of the world to fight against this crime." Dr. Ismael Cosio Villegas, head of the Mexican delegation, wrote after the visit: "The evidence of the US government's launching of bacteriological warfare is significant. The exhibition shows the methods, knowledge, and logic of launching this war." Carlos T. Pierao Bertisky, a dentist and representative of Panama, said: "After visiting this bacteriological warfare exhibition, I can only accept this irrefutable evidence. I condemn the bacteriological warfare launched by American imperialism, and I am sure that when the people of Panama know about this, they will also condemn it." He expressed his heartfelt congratulations to the Chinese people for their great and effective struggle against bacteriological warfare.

Lawyers and attorneys know how to judge evidence. They expressed their opinions after visiting the exhibition. Rafael Lopez Malo, a Mexican lawyer and writer, pointed out: "The responsibility of the US government for using bacteriological weapons has been irrefutably proven in this remarkable exhibition." He said: "The obligation of every individual and the people of all countries is to stop this inhuman crime. ...For the sake of peace, stop the expansion of war and the use of microbial weapons." Dr. Diego Montana Cuella, head of the Colombian delegation, lawyer and university professor, and Juan Morales Eloy, vice chairman of the National Peace Committee of Ecuador, Doctor of Geography and History, said in a jointly signed passage: "I believe that the exhibition on bacteriological warfare absolutely proves that the North American army has deliberately committed this inhuman crime." Osvaldo Rodriguez Jimenez, a lawyer from Costa Rica, also pointed out: "The materials on bacteriological warfare gathered in the exhibition constitute a large amount of evidence, indicating that the army of the United States of North America has had to resort to the use of bacteriological weapons." Yaton Putisongwun, a Thai representative studying law, also pointed out the scientific proof methods of the exhibition during the visit.

Upright religious leaders from various countries expressed strong anger at the bacteriological warfare conducted by the United States. In the afternoon of the 17th, Muhammad Taha Achmar, the 60-year-old Islamic leader and head of the Syrian and Lebanese delegation, visited the exhibition. As he watched, he could not restrain the anger in his heart and kept saying: "So cruel, even beasts are not so cruel." After the visit, he wrote in the opinion book: "I strongly protest this barbaric act. I think even beasts would not be so barbaric. An Arab proverb says: 'The plotter will suffer the consequences of his own actions.' They are so cruel that God will declare war on them." Dhammaratana, head of the Ceylon delegation and Buddhist monk, said: "The US government wants to kill not only human beings with bacteriological warfare, but also all other living things." Utosia, pastor of the Medan Christian Reformed Church in Indonesia, wrote after reading the opinion written by another Indonesian representative, Odo Rendunuwu, a member of parliament: "I completely agree with this opinion." Rendunuwu's opinion was this: "This exhibition on the bacteriological warfare launched by the United States clearly and systematically shows that the enemy of peace has carried out bacteriological warfare in Korea and northern China. Based on the inviolable principles of humanity, my opposition to war, and my love of peace, and based on the evidence presented in this exhibition, I call on all mankind to 'ban bacteriological warfare.'"

Writers who love humanity wrote their anger with their pens. Ramon Amaya Amador, a Honduran novelist and journalist, wrote: "In the face of this shocking crime against humanity, I cannot suppress my voice of protest. What I saw at this exhibition in Beijing will enable me to tell the truth to the people of Honduras and to that part of the world that is related to the bacteriological warfare waged by the Yankees. I add this protest to the thunderous voice of the Chinese and Korean people condemning this act." Juan Araya, a Chilean writer, wrote: "The North Americans have committed bacteriological warfare crimes in Korea, which is indisputable. The irrefutable evidence I saw at this exhibition confirms what I thought: North American imperialists are using terrible methods in an attempt to prolong the war, destroy civilization, and interfere in the lives of all races." Gajjim El Samawi, an Iraqi poet, said during the visit: "The American imperialists are more brutal than the beasts in the forest," but, he pointed out: this is just the death throes of the imperialists.

Grassi, the secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which has 80 million members, pointed out: "The crimes of the American imperialists exceed those of the Nazis." He then wrote powerfully: "However, the peace-loving and progressive people will not fail to condemn these war criminals and will not fail to strengthen their struggle to defend peace."

Ms. Santi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, which unites 135 million democratic women, wrote: "This exhibition shows that your Chinese friends stand among the best fighters for world peace. You have given great help to all honest people, so that they must redouble their efforts to fight against bacteriological warfare and against war. In the face of the suffering of the Chinese and Korean people, in the face of the mothers and families of the dead, we take on the sacred obligation to devote ourselves to the struggle to end the destruction of life."

Mario Ligerme, chairman of the Nitrates Miners' Union of Chile, the "Land of Nitrates," wrote: "I believe that the evidence presented in this exhibition is irrefutable, and the North American aggressors cannot refute it. The Yankees have been determined to have committed these crimes and must be punished."

Ge Geng, a Burmese businessman, wrote: "After visiting this exhibition, we have developed the idea of fighting the brutal war criminals. Only by fighting these war criminals can our children and parents live and work in peace and contentment."

Gaonan, an Indonesian teacher and chairman of an educational group, wrote: "As a teacher, I call on teachers around the world to explain to students how brutal bacteriological warfare is!" He pointed out: It is people's responsibility to force all countries in the world to ban bacteriological warfare, atomic warfare, and other weapons of mass slaughter.

Mrs. Eva Sanderson, head of the Canadian delegation and vice-chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, expressed the attitude of millions of Canadian peace advocates. She wrote: "The evidence of bacteriological warfare makes me very convinced. I hope that when we return to Canada, we can launch a strong protest against bacteriological warfare." John Edward Baxter, secretary of the International Youth Friendship League in Montreal, Canada, wrote: "Millions of Canadians would protest indignantly if they saw and heard what we have seen and heard."

Upright American people cannot help but feel very heavy after seeing the exhibition. Hertiman, deputy head of the US delegation, journalist, and retired orchard operator, wrote: "I, an American citizen, have been disgusted for two years by our killing of friendly people in Korea and Northeast China. Disrespecting life and people is a great sin—and spreading disease in this respect can be said to be the pinnacle. Our use of napalm bombs to raze entire villages is a crime of the same nature. We, as citizens with some power, are responsible for this great mistake. If there is any way to end this crime, I will use all my energy to do it. At the same time, I wish the Chinese and Korean people success in their heroic work in controlling and ending this horror." Mrs. Wilcox, an American representative and artist, is already a grandmother of several children. She educates her children to be upright citizens. After seeing the evidence of the US government's bacteriological warfare and hearing the recorded confessions of US Air Force prisoners of war, it is conceivable what her views would be on the US government's shameless actions to deny it. She wrote: "As a representative from the United States, the recorded testimony of American airmen will be particularly useful in making my compatriots realize that our government has lied to us. As representatives to the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, we all feel that we have a major responsibility to bring the truth about bacteriological warfare back to our countries."

    各国和平代表参观细菌战罪行展览会后
    一致谴责美国政府进行细菌战的罪行
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各国代表一百二十人，在十七日参观了中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主办的“美国政府细菌战罪行展览会”。
    这一百二十位代表来自二十三个不同的国家和四个国际组织。他们有的来自亚洲东南部的缅甸、锡兰、印度、印尼和泰国，有的来自地中海的塞浦路斯以及中东、近东的伊朗、伊拉克、以色列和黎巴嫩、叙利亚，还有很多代表来自遥远的美洲大陆上的加拿大、智利、哥伦比亚、哥斯达黎加、厄瓜多尔、萨尔瓦多、危地马拉、洪都拉斯、墨西哥、尼加拉瓜、巴拿马、秘鲁。其他四位是世界工会联合会、国际民主妇女联合会、国际学生联合会和国际新闻工作者协会的代表。在此以前，美国和其他国家的代表们也参观了展览会。
    医务工作者们对细菌战不能不感到最大的愤慨，他们为解除人类的疾病和痛苦而贡献着他们的精力，然而美帝国主义者却散布疾病和死亡。缅甸代表、仰光妇女福利协会主席都钦七，本人又是产科医生，她写道：“……我看见了美帝国主义者对朝鲜和中国发动的野蛮行为。作为一个医生，我以为这是一个极不人道的行为。美帝国主义不敢面对面斗争，而卑怯地用细菌来杀人，缅甸和佛教徒的习俗认为这是不可宽恕的罪行。……我们必须把我们的力量联合起来，团结世界上的全部人民来和这种罪行斗争。”墨西哥代表团团长、医生伊斯玛尔·科西奥·维里盖斯在参观之后写道：“美国政府展开细菌战的证明是显著的，展览会显示出发动这个战争的方法、知识和逻辑。”巴拿马代表、牙科医生卡罗斯·第·皮尔奥·柏特里斯基说：“在参观了这个细菌战展览会之后，我只有接受这些不可驳斥的证据。我谴责美帝国主义发动的细菌战，我确信，当巴拿马人民知道这些之后，他们也会予以谴责的。”他表示衷心庆贺中国人民反细菌战的巨大而有效的斗争。
    法律家和律师们懂得如何判断证据。他们在参观了展览会之后发表了他们的意见。墨西哥的律师和作家拉法尔·洛培斯·马洛指出：“美国政府使用细菌武器的责任，在这个值得注意的展览会上被无可置辩地证明了。”他说：“每一个人和世界各国人民的义务是制止这个反人道的罪行。……为了和平，制止战争扩大和使用微生物武器。”哥伦比亚代表团团长、律师和大学教授迪埃哥·蒙塔尼亚·库艾拉博士和厄瓜多尔全国和平委员会副主席、地理学和历史学博士胡安·摩拉雷斯·埃洛伊在共同签署的一段话中说：“我以为关于细菌战的展览绝对证明了北美军队已蓄意犯了这个反人道的罪行。”哥斯达黎加的律师奥斯瓦尔多·罗德利格兹·希迈尼兹同样指出：“展览会中汇集的关于细菌战的材料，构成大量证据，指明北美合众国的军队已不得不求助于使用细菌武器。”研究法律学的泰国代表?亚吞·朴提颂汶在参观时也指出展览会的科学的证明方法。
    各国正直的宗教领袖对美国进行的细菌战表示了强烈的愤怒。十七日下午，叙利亚与黎巴嫩代表团团长、六十岁的伊斯兰教领袖穆哈默德·塔哈·阿契玛尔参观了展览会。他一面看，一面禁不住胸中的愤怒，不断地说：“这样残酷，即使是野兽也没有这样残酷。”他在参观完毕后在意见簿上写道：“我强烈地抗议这个野蛮行为，我想即使野兽也不会这样野蛮。阿拉伯谚语说：‘施诡计者，自食其果’。他们这样残酷，真主也会对他们宣战的。”锡兰代表团团长、佛教法师达马拉塔纳说：“美国政府用细菌战想杀害的不仅是人类，而且也想杀害其他一切生物。”印度尼西亚棉兰基督教归正会牧师乌托西亚在看另一位印尼代表、国会议员奥多·伦度诺乌写的意见之后写道：“我完全同意这个意见”。伦度诺乌的意见是这样的：“这个关于美国发动的细菌战的展览会，清楚地和有系统地显示出：和平的敌人已在朝鲜和中国北部进行了细菌战。根据不可侵犯的人道原则、我的反对战争的情绪和对和平的爱好，根据这个展览会陈列的证据，我号召全人类‘禁止细菌战’。”
    热爱人类的作家们用他们的笔写出了他们的愤怒。洪都拉斯小说家和新闻工作者拉蒙·阿马亚·阿马多尔写道：“在这个令人震惊的反人道罪行之前，我不能压制我的抗议的声音。我在北京的这个展览会上所看到的，将使我能用来向洪都拉斯人民以及世界上那些和美国佬进行的细菌战有关的那部分的人民叙述真相，我把这抗议加入到中朝人民谴责这个行为的雷霆般的声音中。”智利作家胡安·阿拉亚写道：“北美洲人已经在朝鲜犯了细菌战罪行，这是无可争辩的。我在这个展览会上看到的不容置辩的证据，确定了我所想的：北美帝国主义者使用可怕的方法，企图延长战争、毁灭文明，干涉各种族的生活。”伊拉克诗人加吉姆·艾尔·萨马威在参观时说：“美帝国主义者比森林中的野兽还要残暴”，但是，他指出：这只是帝国主义者的垂死挣扎。
    拥有八千万会员的世界工会联合会的书记葛拉西指出：“美帝国主义者的罪行超过了纳粹的罪行”，他接着有力地写道：“然而，爱好和平与进步的人民不会不谴责这些战争罪犯，不会不加强他们保卫和平的斗争。”
    团结着一亿三千五百万民主妇女的国际民主妇女联合会的副总书记桑蒂女士写道：“这个展览会显示出你们中国朋友们站在争取世界和平的最优秀的战士之列。你们给了一切诚实的人民以重大的帮助，使他们要加倍努力进行斗争，来反对细菌战，反对战争。在中朝人民所受到的苦难的面前，在死者的母亲们和家属们的面前，我们负起神圣的义务，要把全副身心投入终止毁灭生命的斗争。”
    来自“硝石之国”的智利硝矿工人工会主席马里奥·利盖尔美写道：“我认为这个展览会陈列出来的证据是无可辩驳的，北美侵略者不可能反驳它们。美国佬已经确定犯了这些罪行，必须受到惩罚。”
    缅甸的商业家哥耕写道：“我们参观了这个展览会之后，产生了对残暴的战犯斗争的思想。我们只有向这些战犯进行斗争，我们的孩子和父母才能过安居乐业的日子。”
    印度尼西亚的教师、教育团体的主席高南写道：“作为一个教师，我号召全世界教师同仁，向学生们解释细菌战是多么地残暴！”他指出：迫使世界各国禁止细菌战、原子战和其他大规模屠杀的武器，是人们的责任。
    加拿大代表团团长、加拿大和平大会副主席伊娃·桑德逊夫人表达出千万加拿大和平拥护者的态度，她写道：“细菌战的证据使我十分信服。我希望在我们回到加拿大后，能发动一个强大的抗议来反对细菌战。”加拿大蒙特里尔的国际青年友好同盟秘书约翰·爱德华·巴克斯特写道：“千万加拿大人如果看到和听到我们所曾看到和听到的，将会愤慨地表示抗议。”
    正直的美国人民在看到展览会之后，不能不感到十分沉重。美国代表团副团长、新闻工作者和退休的果园经营者赫第曼写道：“我，一个美国公民，两年以来一直为我们杀戮在朝鲜和中国东北的友善人民而感到厌恶。藐视生命和人是极大的罪过——而散布疾病在这一方面可以说是登峰造极。我们使用凝固汽油弹来夷平整个村庄是同样性质的罪恶。我们作为有一些权力的公民，对这个极大的错误负有责任。如果有什么方法可以能结束这个罪恶，我将用全部精力来这样做。在此同时，祝中朝人民控制与结束这个恐怖的英勇工作得到成功。”美国代表、艺术家维尔科克斯老太太已经是好几个孩子的祖母了，她教育她的孩子们成为正直的公民，她在看到美国政府进行细菌战的证据，听到美国空军战俘的供词录音之后，对于美国政府一味抵赖的无耻行动将会抱持什么看法是可想而知的。她写道：“作为一个从美国来的代表，美国航空员的证词录音，对于使我的同胞认识我们的政府对我们说了谎，将特别有用。作为出席亚洲及太平洋和平会议的代表，我们都觉得有把关于细菌战的真相带回国去的重大责任。”
