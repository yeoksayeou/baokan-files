Xinhua News Agency, October 2nd—At the opening ceremony of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, Liu Ningyi, Secretary-General of the Peace Conference Preparatory Committee, reported on the preparations. The full text is as follows:

    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, which is longed for by hundreds of millions of people in the Asian and Pacific regions, is about to open today.

    Due to the enthusiastic support and active preparations for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference by the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, there are now 344 representatives from 37 countries and 34 alternate representatives attending the meeting, totaling 378 people. We are particularly honored to have seven alternate representatives from the United Kingdom, France, Brazil, and Algeria, as well as representatives from organizations such as the World Peace Council, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the WFTU Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau, the Women's International Democratic Federation, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the International Union of Students, totaling eight people, and special guests Mrs. Felton from the United Kingdom, Brandweiner from Austria, and Zhang Bojun, Cai Tingkai, and Mei Ru’ao from China, totaling five people, to participate in the conference. The total number of participants is 398.

    Our representatives attending the meeting come from various countries, races, classes, and social occupations; there are representatives of various social groups, famous worker and peasant leaders, various experts, scholars, professors, writers, poets, artists, journalists, lawyers, medical workers, members of parliament, industrialists and businessmen, and leaders of various religions. This fully demonstrates that our conference has broad representation and shows the concern of the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions for the cause of defending peace and striving for peace. It has not been easy for our peace friends to attend the meeting: some have traveled long distances, some have faced obstacles in obtaining passports and visas, some have suffered unreasonable persecution, and some have risked unemployment or arrest. However, with the warm support of the people in their own countries and other countries, the representatives, bearing the peace mission of 1.6 billion people, have finally overcome all difficulties and arrived in Beijing. This spirit of struggle makes me feel very admiration, and at the same time, it shows how urgent the desire for peace is among the people of the entire region.

    Our peace representatives from various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions are now able to gather together to discuss the major plans for peace in the Asian and Pacific regions, which cannot but be said to be a great victory. As the Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, I extend a warm welcome and respect to the peace friends who have gathered together.

    Now that the work of the Preparatory Committee has come to an end, I would like to wish this peace conference a success in the spirit of mutual consultation and friendly cooperation.

    刘宁一秘书长报告会议筹备情况
    【新华社二日讯】在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议开幕式上，和平会议筹备委员会秘书长刘宁一报告筹备情况，全文如下：
    亚洲及太平洋区域亿万人民所渴望的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议今天就要开幕了。
    由于亚洲及太平洋各国人民对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的热烈拥护和积极筹备，现在到会的已有三十七个国家的代表三百四十四人、列席代表三十四人。总共三百七十八人。使我们感到特别荣幸的是还有应邀参加的英国、法国、巴西、阿尔及利亚的列席代表七人，世界和平理事会、世界工会联合会、世界工联亚澳联络局、国际民主妇女联合会、国际民主法律工作者协会、世界民主青年联盟、国际学生联合会等组织的代表八人，以及特邀来宾英国费尔顿夫人，奥地利的布兰德魏纳和中国的章伯钧、蔡廷锴、梅汝璈五人来参加大会。总共三百九十八人。
    我们出席会议的这些代表是来自各个国家、各个种族、各个阶层、各种社会职业；有各种社会团体的代表，有著名的工人和农民领袖，有各种专家、学者、教授，有作家、诗人、艺术工作者、记者、律师、医务工作者，有国会议员、工商业家、各种宗教的领袖，这充分说明我们的会议是有着广泛的代表性，而且表明亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民对于保卫和平争取和平的事业的关切。我们这些和平朋友们的到会是不容易的：有的经过长途跋涉，有的经过出国护照签证的阻难，有的遭受过无理迫害，有的冒着失业或被逮捕的危险，但是代表们在本国和各国人民的热烈支持下，负荷着十六亿人民的和平使命，终于冲破所有一切的困难，到达了北京。这种斗争精神使我感到非常敬佩，同时这也说明了全区人民要求和平的意愿是如何的迫切。
    我们亚洲及太平洋区域各国的和平代表们，现在，能够聚集一堂，来共商亚洲及太平洋区域的和平大计，这不能不说是一个伟大的胜利。我以筹备委员会秘书长的身份对欢聚的和平朋友们表示热烈的欢迎和敬意。
    现在，筹备委员会的工作已告结束，我谨预祝这次和平会议在共同协商和友好合作的精神下获得成功。
