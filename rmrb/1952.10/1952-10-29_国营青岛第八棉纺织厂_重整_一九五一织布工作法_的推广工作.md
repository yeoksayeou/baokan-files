    State-Run Qingdao No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory
    Intensifies the Promotion of the "1951 Weaving Method"
    Editor: In the process of promoting the "1951 Weaving Method," the State-Run Qingdao No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory experienced a situation where the advanced work method could not be smoothly promoted and output and quality decreased, due to the arrogance of Deputy Factory Director Yang Guangxu and others, who did not value the creativity of the workers. After criticism in the newspaper, Deputy Factory Director Yang Guangxu and others gradually recognized their mistakes, made self-criticisms to the workers, and regarded the restoration and consolidation of the "1951 Weaving Method" as the main method for increasing production and practicing economy. At the same time, the leadership conducted supplementary education for the workers based on their ideological situation, dispelling ideological concerns among workers, such as emphasizing that the machines were not easy to use or that the work method could not be implemented on the night shift. Supplementary lessons on the work method were given to some workers who had not mastered the "1951 Weaving Method," and the "little teacher" system was restored. To prevent the promotion work from becoming a mere formality, an inspection system was also established. Now, the rate of second-class cloth in this factory has been reduced from about 12 percent to about 1.5 percent, and the number of looms that workers can manage has increased from an average of 18 to 24, with the highest reaching 32.
    However, there are still some shortcomings, such as the patrol cycle not being smooth enough, and individual small actions not being fully implemented. Therefore, continued efforts should be made to ensure that workers correctly implement the work method.

    国营青岛第八棉纺织厂
    重整“一九五一织布工作法”的推广工作
    编辑同志：国营青岛第八棉纺织厂，在推广“一九五一织布工作法”中，曾由于副厂长杨光煦等妄自尊大，不重视职工创造，造成先进工作法不能顺利推广，产量、质量降低的现象。经过报纸的批判，副厂长杨光煦等逐渐认识到他们的错误，向职工作了自我检讨，并把恢复和巩固“一九五一织布工作法”作为增产节约的主要方法。同时，领导方面根据群众的思想情况，对工人进行了补课教育，打破职工强调车不好使，或作夜班就不能执行工作法等思想顾虑。对部分未掌握“一九五一织布工作法”的工人，进行了工作法补课，并恢复了“小先生”制度。为防止推广工作流于形式，又建立了检查制度。现在，这个厂的次布率由百分之十二降低到百分之一点五左右，职工的看台能力由平均十八台提高到二十四台，最高的达到三十二台。
    但目前还存在若干缺点，如巡回周期还不够平稳，个别小动作还没有完全作好等。所以还应继续努力，使职工正确地执行工作法。
    黄建章
