    The People of the Capital Cheer the Great Achievements of the Peace Conference
    ——Reader Letters Summary
    Readers have written to the editorial department of this newspaper, warmly cheering the great achievements of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and expressing their determination to strive for the thorough implementation of the resolutions adopted by the conference.
    The Beijing Agricultural University Correspondence Group wrote: The news of the successful conclusion of the conference caused a sensation at our school. Early in the morning on the 13th, everyone spontaneously organized to listen to the broadcast. When the newspapers arrived at the campus that day, the students immediately gathered around, scrambling to read the news and documents of the Peace Conference. Many students also held small discussion meetings. In the evening, a school-wide celebration was held, with revelry continuing until after 1 a.m. the next morning.
    The Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce wrote: All the resolutions of the conference demonstrate the will of the 1.6 billion people of the Asian and Pacific regions to defend peace and stop aggression. The US imperialist blockade and embargo policy against the Chinese people has created artificial barriers between many countries and China. As a result, the production of these countries has shrunk, industries and businesses have gone bankrupt, unemployment has increased, and the people's lives have become more painful. At the same time, US imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, actively reviving the aggressive forces of Japan and West Germany, and has recently unilaterally suspended the Korean armistice negotiations, making the world situation even more tense. In order to develop equal and mutually beneficial international trade and improve people's lives, we must unite more closely and shatter the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism. Therefore, the industrialists and businessmen of Beijing not only cheer the brilliant achievements of the Peace Conference, but will also resolutely fight for the implementation of all the resolutions of the conference.
    The children of the motherland love every voice of peace. Wang Zhiguo of Beijing No. 8 Middle School, in a letter to the peace representatives, said: Chinese children hope to have a great peace chorus with you. Today, this great chorus has already begun, and it will become more and more magnificent and louder. Let us in the near future, on the vast Pacific Ocean, embrace for happiness and sing for peace!

    首都人民欢呼和平会议的伟大成就
    ——读者来信综述
    读者纷纷写信给本报编辑部，热烈欢呼亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的伟大成就，并表示决心为彻底实现会议通过的各项决议而奋斗。
    北京农业大学通讯组来信说：大会胜利闭幕的消息，使我们学校沸腾了起来。十三日一早，大家都自动组织收听广播。当天的报纸到达校院时，同学们立刻簇拥一团，抢着看和平会议的消息和文件。许多同学并举行了小型漫谈会。入夜，举行了全校性质的庆祝大会，狂欢直至翌日晨一时以后。
    北京市工商业联合会来信说：大会的一切决议，都表现了亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民保卫和平、制止侵略行动的意志。美帝国主义敌视中国人民的封锁禁运政策，使许多国家和中国之间树立起人为的障碍。其结果使这些国家的生产萎缩，工商业破产，失业人数增加，人民生活更加痛苦。同时，美帝国主义还侵占着我国的领土台湾，积极复活日本和西德的侵略势力，最近竟又片面中止朝鲜停战谈判，使世界形势更趋紧张。为了开展平等互利的国际贸易，改善人民的生活，我们必须更紧密地团结起来，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。因此，北京市工商业者不但为和平会议的辉煌成就而欢呼，并将为大会全部决议的贯彻执行而坚决奋斗。
    祖国的孩子们热爱着每一个和平的声音。北京市第八中学的王治国，在写给和平代表的信上说：中国的孩子希望和你们来一个和平大合唱。今天，这个大合唱已经开始了，并将越来越雄壮越响亮。让我们在不久的将来，在辽阔的太平洋上，为了幸福而拥抱，为了和平而歌唱吧！
