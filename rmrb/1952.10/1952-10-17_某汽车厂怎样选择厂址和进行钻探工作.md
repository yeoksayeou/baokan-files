How a Certain Automobile Factory Chooses a Site and Conducts Drilling Work
    Hu Liang
The design work of a certain automobile factory was entrusted by our government to Soviet experts. The Soviet experts were very serious and meticulous in their selection of the factory site and their requirements for surveying and drilling.

When selecting a factory site, the Soviet experts not only considered whether the topography, geology, and transportation conditions were suitable for building a factory, but also whether it was in accordance with economic principles. Before the Soviet experts arrived on the scene, the comrades of the factory's preparatory group had already selected a site in the construction area. It was on a plain surrounded by ditches on three sides. Its groundwater level met the requirements for building a factory, and it had enough area for building factory buildings and dormitories, but it was far from the railway and the city, and separated by a mountain. The comrades in charge of preparation believed that this place was in accordance with economic principles, because the factory buildings and dormitories were all built on the plain, which could avoid the earthwork engineering of leveling the ground during construction. However, after the Soviet experts looked at the topographic map of the nearby area and conducted an on-site survey, they believed that although this place could also be used to build a factory, it was not very in accordance with economic principles. Why? Because the factory was far from the railway, the required railway branch line would be long, which would cost more money; moreover, the railway and the factory were separated by a low-lying area, and a lot of earthwork had to be filled when building the railway, some of which had to be filled to a height of 20 meters, which was technically difficult. This is one reason. Second, because it was far from the city, it could not make full use of the city's existing municipal facilities, such as tap water and gas, which would inevitably increase construction costs. The reason why the comrades of the preparatory group chose this site and believed it was economical was because they only considered the problem from the surface (thinking it was flat), isolating the factory and not considering its connection with the outside world. The Soviet experts finally chose a site on a hill near the city and next to the railway line. This was a slope and not very flat. On the surface, it seemed very difficult to build a factory there, but it was a more ideal site. Because it had the following advantages over the originally selected site: First, the railway branch line was shortened by three-quarters, and there was no need to fill earth when building the road, only to level the ground. Second, it could make full use of existing municipal facilities, saving construction costs for tap water, gas, etc. Third, it could use nearly 100,000 square meters of old houses nearby. With slight repairs, they could be used as dormitories, hospitals, etc., which was a large saving. Fourth, although the terrain was not good, more earthwork would be leveled during construction. Under the current conditions in China, leveling earthwork is easier and less costly than filling earthwork.

The surveying and drilling work of the factory was also carried out under the specific guidance of Soviet experts. The Soviet experts required comprehensive and accurate topographic surveying and geological drilling work.

How was the geological drilling work of this factory carried out? How can the design requirements be met? The drilling work was divided into three steps. First, preliminary drilling was carried out. This was done before the site was decided, and the purpose was to determine whether the area was suitable as a factory site. Second, after the site was decided, general drilling was carried out. General drilling was to evenly distribute drilling points throughout the factory site area. Connecting the drilling points horizontally and vertically divided the factory site area into several equal square grids. They drilled forty-eight shallow holes this time, each hole being twenty to twenty-two meters deep. In addition, three deep holes, each 100 meters deep, were drilled at the location of the main workshop. Arranging the strata of these boreholes horizontally and vertically constituted an ideal profile of the strata of the factory site, which showed the changes in the strata throughout the area and the gradient of the groundwater level. Finally, focus drilling was carried out. This was carried out at the location of the factory building and main workshop. They made a total of eleven test pits, the depth of which reached the groundwater level of the strata. The purpose of making test pits was to conduct scientific analysis of the soil and soil pressure tests in order to determine the pressure that the strata could withstand. This is of great significance to the design of the factory building. Our designers did not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of this issue. They did not pay attention to conducting soil analysis and soil pressure tests. When designing, some people judged the land bearing capacity based on experience, while others were afraid of insecurity and strengthened the foundation engineering without any basis. This unrealistic style of work either caused rework losses or caused waste of building materials and manpower.

Soviet experts also had very strict requirements for topographic surveying. They required that terrain with a height difference of more than one meter be represented on the survey map with contour lines. Some of our technicians believed that such detailed topographic maps were unnecessary because they had never done so before. Soviet experts believed that this was very important. Not only could a correct factory layout map be made on a detailed topographic map, but also the amount of earthwork for construction could be estimated based on the contour lines. Soviet experts calculated that the most economical earthwork for the factory was about 300,000 cubic meters. Without a detailed topographic map, this amount of earthwork could not be estimated.

Based on the above, we know that Soviet experts not only require a factory to be designed well, but also try to do it as cost-effectively as possible. This spirit is very worthy of learning.

    某汽车厂怎样选择厂址和进行钻探工作
    胡亮
    某汽车厂的设计工作，是由我国政府委托苏联专家做的。苏联专家对厂址的选择和对测量钻探的要求，是非常严肃而认真的。
    苏联专家在选择厂址时，不仅考虑地形、地质、交通等条件是否适于建厂，并且考虑是否合乎经济原则。苏联专家到达现场以前，该厂筹备组的同志已经在建厂地区选择了一个厂址。它是在一块三面有沟的平原上，它的地下水位合乎建厂要求，并有足够的面积供给建筑厂房和宿舍之用，但距铁道较远，离市区也较远，还隔着一座山。筹备的同志认为这个地方是合乎经济原则的，因为厂房和宿舍都建筑在平原上，建设时可以免去平土方的工程。但苏联专家看了附近地区地形图和到现场勘察以后，认为这个地方虽然也可以建厂，但不很合乎经济原则。为什么？因为厂房离铁路较远，需要的铁路支线就长，花钱就多；而且铁路和厂房之间是洼地，建铁路时必须填很多土方，有的要填到二十公尺高，在技术上又有困难，这是一。二、离市区较远，就不能充分利用城市已有的市政设备，如自来水、煤气等，因而必然增加建设费用。筹备组的同志所以选择这个厂址和认为它是经济的，是因为他们只从表面（认为平坦）来考虑问题，把工厂孤立起来，没有把它和外部的联系结合起来考虑。苏联专家最后在市区附近、铁路线旁边的一个丘陵上选择厂址。这是一个坡地，不很平坦，从表面来看，在那里建厂是很困难的，但却是比较理想的厂址。因为它比原来选择的厂址有下列好处：一、铁路支线缩短了四分之三，筑路时，不需要填土方，只要平土方；二、可以充分利用现有的市政设备，节省自来水、煤气等建设费；三、可以利用附近的将近十万平方公尺的旧房子，只要稍加修理，就可以作宿舍、医院等用，这是一笔很大的节约数字；四、该地地形虽然不好，但建厂时只要多平土方，在目前中国的条件下，平土方比填土方容易，而且成本低。
    该厂的测量和钻探工作，也是在苏联专家的具体指导下进行的。苏联专家要求做全面的、准确的地形测量和地质钻探工作。
    这个厂的地质钻探工作怎样进行？怎样才能达到设计的要求呢？钻探工作分三个步骤。首先做初步钻探。这是在决定厂址前做的，其目的在于决定该地有没有条件作为厂址。其次，决定厂址后，就进行普遍钻探。普遍钻探是在整个厂址区域内均匀地分配钻探点，把钻探点按横的和纵的方向连起来，就把厂址区域分成若干相等的方格子。他们这次钻了四十八个浅孔，每孔深二十到二十二公尺。此外，在主要车间所在地占了三个深孔，每孔深百公尺。把这些钻孔的地层按横的和纵的排列起来，就构成厂址的地层理想剖面图，可以看出整个区域的地层变化情形，地层水位坡度。最后是重点钻探。这是在厂房和主要车间所在地进行的。他们共做了十一个探井，其深度直至地层潜水面。作探井的目的，在于做土壤的科学分析和土压试验，以便决定地层所能承受的压力。这对于厂房的设计有着重要的意义。我们的设计人员对这个问题的重要性是认识不足的，不注意做土壤分析和土压试验工作，在设计时，有的人凭经验来判断土地承压力，有的则怕不安全而没有根据地加固基础工程。这种不实事求是的作风，不是造成返工损失，就是造成建筑材料和人力的浪费。
    苏联专家对地形测量也要求很严格。他们要求把高低相差一公尺以上的地形都要用等高线表现在测量图上。我们有些技术人员认为这样细致的地形图是不必要的，原因是他们从来没这样做过。苏联专家认为这是非常重要的，在细致的地形图上不仅可以做正确的厂房布置图，并且可以根据等高线所示来估计建筑的土方工程量。苏联专家计算出该厂最经济的土方工程为平三十万方公尺左右。如果没有细致的地形图，这个土方工程量是没法估计出来的。
    根据以上所述，我们知道苏联专家对一个工厂的设计，不仅要求做得好，并且尽量做得省钱。这种精神非常值得学习。
