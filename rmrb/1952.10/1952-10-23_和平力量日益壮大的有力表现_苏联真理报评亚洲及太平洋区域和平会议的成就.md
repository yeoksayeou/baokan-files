    The Beijing Conference is one of the current events that vividly reflects the fundamental changes that have taken place in the lives of many nations and countries in recent times. It reflects the will of the people of thirty-seven countries to strive for peace. The work of the conference and the documents it adopted prove that the unity of peace advocates is growing, not only nationally but also internationally. The unanimity shown in passing resolutions at the conference proves that the idea of friendly cooperation to fight for the common goal of strengthening the international united front for peace is maturing among the broad masses. The speeches of the delegates at the conference, with very convincing arguments, once again exposed the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism before the people of all countries. The conference once again exposed the hypocrisy of the aggressors, who pretended to be the saviors of the people of Asian countries, but in fact they are suffocating the freedom and independence of all nations and attempting long-term colonial plunder and oppression. The atrocities of the American interventionists in Korea have aroused unanimous indignation among the people of Asia and the Pacific countries, as well as the people of the world. The bacteriological warfare waged by the U.S. armed forces in Korea is a serious threat to the people of the world; the Chinese and Korean people have become the targets of bacteriological warfare attacks. The investigation by the International Scientific Commission once again proved this fact.
    All of this has created the danger of the continuation and expansion of the Korean War and further tension in the Far East situation.
    The resistance of the people in colonial and dependent countries to the imperialist enslavers is becoming increasingly resolute. The struggles of the people of Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines, and the growth of national resistance in Iran, Egypt, and other countries, prove that the scope of the national liberation movement is expanding. The oppressed people of Asia and the Pacific countries are increasingly aware that the war preparations made by the imperialists will make the shackles that enslave them stronger. The struggle for peace and national liberation has become the cause of all upright patriots in their countries. The representatives of Latin American countries pointed out at the conference that the movement for peace and against American expansion is rising in their countries. It is significant that the people of most Latin American countries finally did not allow their countries to send soldiers to Korea.
    The great achievements of the Chinese people in building a new life have won the admiration of the delegates attending the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The representatives of the people of all countries believe that the consolidation of the great Sino-Soviet friendship is a major factor in maintaining and consolidating peace in the Far East. They warmly praised the Soviet people's efforts in the struggle for peace and their remarkable achievements in communist construction. The delegates attending the conference unanimously pointed out that the people of Asia and the Pacific countries consider the Soviet Union to be the most solid fortress of world peace and the leading force in the struggle for peace and against the conspiracies of war mongers.
    The Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference adopted many resolutions, which played a huge role in expanding and strengthening the peace movement. The resolutions of the conference provided a combat program for the struggle for peace and national independence, which will promote its further upsurge. At present, due to the increasing strength of the peace and democracy camp, it is very likely to avert another world war. Now, it is necessary to further increase the enthusiasm of the masses, strengthen the work of organizing peace advocates, and tirelessly expose the war mongers, not allowing them to deceive the people with a series of lies. The most important task of all progressive peace-loving humanity is to combat and isolate the gamblers in the imperialist aggressor camp. For the sake of their own profits, they are trying to plunge the people of all countries into a bloody war.

    和平力量日益壮大的有力表现
    ——苏联真理报评亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成就
    北京会议是生动地反映了最近时期许多民族和国家的生活中所发生的根本变化的当前事件之一。它反映了三十七个国家的人民的争取和平的意志。会议的工作及其所通过的文件证明了和平拥护者的团结正在日益加强，其规模不仅是全国的，而且是国际的。会议上通过决议时所表现的一致证明了：友好合作为加强争取和平的国际统一战线的共同目标而斗争的观念在广大群众中日益成熟了。代表们在会议上的演说以十分令人信服的论据在各国人民面前再一次揭露了美帝国主义的侵略性质。会议再度揭穿了侵略者的伪善，他们冒充是亚洲各国人民的救主，事实上他们正在窒息各民族的自由和独立并企图长期进行殖民掠夺和压迫。美国干涉者在朝鲜的暴行引起了亚洲及太平洋各国人民以及全世界人民的一致愤怒。美国武装部队在朝鲜进行的细菌战是对全世界人民的严重威胁；中国人民与朝鲜人民已成为细菌战进攻的目标。国际科学委员会的调查又一次证明了这一事实。
    所有这一切造成了朝鲜战争的继续和扩大以及远东局势更加紧张的危险。
    殖民地和附属国的人民对帝国主义奴役者的抵抗日益坚决。越南、马来亚、菲律宾各国人民的斗争，伊朗、埃及和其他国家的民族反抗的增长，证明了民族解放运动的范围日益扩大。亚洲和太平洋各国被压迫人民日益清楚地认识到：帝国主义者所进行的战争准备将使奴役他们的枷锁变得牢固。争取和平与民族解放的斗争已成为他们国家中所有正直的爱国者的事业。拉丁美洲各国的代表在会议上指出了争取和平和反对美国扩张的运动正在他们国家内日益高涨。拉丁美洲大多数国家的人民终于没有让他们的国家派兵士到朝鲜去，这是一件意义重大的事。
    中国人民在建设新生活方面的伟大成就，赢得了出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议代表们的敬佩。各国人民的代表认为伟大的苏中友谊的巩固是保持和巩固远东和平的一个主要因素。他们热烈地赞美苏维埃人民在争取和平的斗争中的各种努力，以及他们在共产主义建设方面的显著成就。出席会议的代表一致指出亚洲及太平洋各国人民认为苏联是全世界和平的最巩固的堡垒，是争取和平、反对战争贩子的阴谋的领导力量。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议通过了许多决议，对扩大与加强和平运动起了巨大的作用。会议的决议为争取和平，争取民族独立的斗争提供了一个促使它进一步高涨的战斗纲领。目前，由于和平民主阵营力量的增强，很可能使另一次世界大战免于爆发。现在，必须进一步提高群众的积极性，加强把和平拥护者组织起来的工作，不倦地揭发战争贩子，不让他们用一连串的谎言来蒙蔽人民。所有进步的爱好和平的人类的最重要的任务是打击及孤立帝国主义侵略者阵营中的赌徒。他们为着他们自己的利润，企图使各国人民陷入血腥的战争中。
