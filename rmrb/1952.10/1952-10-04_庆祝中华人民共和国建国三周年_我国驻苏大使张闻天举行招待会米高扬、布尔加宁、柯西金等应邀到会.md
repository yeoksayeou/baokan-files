Ambassador Zhang delivered a speech at the reception, saying:

    Dear guests!

    Today is the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We feel boundless excitement and pride in the great victories achieved by the Chinese people in the past three years on all fronts under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. What makes us particularly excited and happy is that the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union has further developed and consolidated over the past three years. The Chinese people firmly believe that this great friendship, as Comrade Stalin pointed out, is a reliable guarantee against the threat of new aggression and a powerful pillar of peace in the Far East and the world. This is a profound, unbreakable, and permanent friendship closely linked by the common interests and common ideals of the two peoples, and by the common struggle to defend peace and international security. No force in the world can undermine this friendship, and no force can stop its continued development and consolidation!

    In the past three years, the American imperialists have used all kinds of sinister means of intimidation, sabotage, and incitement to oppose the new China. However, in the past three years, with the assistance of the Soviet Union and with the support of all people's democratic countries and all peace-loving people in the world, the Chinese people have smashed all the conspiracies and intrigues of American imperialism with their invincible and unyielding fighting will and heroic spirit. Now that the Chinese people have broken the colonial enslavement system of imperialism in Asia and established their own People's Republic of China, now that the People's Republic of China has emerged on the Asian continent like the rising sun, it must grow and blossom, it must become an inspiring example for the oppressed nations of the East, and it must stand together with the Soviet Union, with all the people's democratic countries, and with all peace-loving people in Asia and the world, to shoulder the responsibility of defending peace in the Far East and world peace. No force in the world can stop the growth, prosperity, and strength of the new China. No force in the world can stop the new China from moving towards socialism.

    The Chinese people are advancing bravely towards a bright future with full confidence. Victory is ours! Let us raise our glasses to congratulate: Long live the prosperity of the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the permanent and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!

    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!

    Long live the leader and teacher of the people of the world, the best friend of the Chinese people, the great Marshal Stalin!

Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Mikoyan then raised his glass to the prosperity of the People's Republic of China and to the health of the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong.

Ambassador Zhang then repeatedly raised his glass to the health of Marshal Stalin's closest comrades-in-arms, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Mikoyan and Bulganin; to the health of Deputy Chairmen of the Soviet Council of Ministers Kosygin, Malyshev, and Pervukhin; to the health of the outstanding Soviet diplomat, the faithful executor of Stalin's peace policy, Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Vyshinsky, and Deputy Ministers Pushkin and Podtserob; to the health of the Soviet Minister of the Army, Soviet Marshal Vasilyevsky, and Soviet Marshal Budyonny; to the health of the Soviet Army and Soviet soldiers, sailors, officers, generals, and marshals; to the further development and consolidation of trade relations and economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union; and to the health of the Soviet Minister of Foreign Trade Kumykin.

Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Bulganin raised his glass and said: The festival that the great Chinese people are celebrating today, and the festival that we, the friends of the Chinese people, are celebrating here, is not only a major event in the East, but also a festival of world significance. Today our newspapers rightly pointed out that this is the third most important event since our revolution: the first is the Russian October Revolution, the second is the Soviet Patriotic War, and the third is the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution. The Chinese People's Liberation Army played no small part in this victory. This army is a truly heroic army, demonstrating bravery, fortitude, and self-sacrifice over a long period. It was thanks to the bravery and strength of its soldiers and commanders that victory was possible. It was the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people who crushed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the Japanese invaders, and it was they who guaranteed everything that China has achieved today. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has done great things. A toast to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to the Chinese people, to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and to Mao Zedong, the inspirer of the Chinese people's victory.

Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Vyshinsky raised his glass and said: Since its founding, the People's Republic of China has traveled a remarkable road of victory in domestic and foreign policy. When diplomacy is inspired by the hopes and demands of its people, it can become active and effective. The diplomacy of the People's Republic of China is inspired by the ideas that guide the Chinese people forward. Zhou Enlai, an outstanding figure and one of Mao Zedong's comrades-in-arms, leads Chinese diplomacy. To the health of Zhou Enlai, to the achievements of the diplomacy of the People's Republic of China, and to the health of the Chinese diplomat Ambassador Zhang Wentian present here.

Soviet Minister of Foreign Trade Kumykin raised his glass to the health of Li Fuchun, an outstanding politician of the People's Republic of China and a close comrade-in-arms of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai.

Finally, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Mikoyan invited everyone to toast the unbreakable friendship between the great Soviet Union and the great China, and to toast the great Stalin and Mao Zedong.

The reception proceeded in a friendly atmosphere and ended joyfully late into the night.

    亲爱的来宾们！
    今天是中华人民共和国成立的三周年。对于三年来中国人民在自己伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的领导下在各个战线上所获得的伟大胜利，我们感到无限的兴奋与骄傲，特别使得我们感到兴奋与愉快的是三年来中苏两国之间的伟大友谊更加发展与巩固了。中国人民深信，这一伟大友谊，正像斯大林同志所指出的，是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，远东与世界和平的有力支柱。这是一种为两国人民的共同利益、共同理想和为保卫和平及国际安全的共同斗争所紧密联结起来的深厚的、牢不可破的、永久的友谊。世界上没有一种力量，能够破坏这种友谊，能够阻止这种友谊的继续发展与巩固！
    三年来，美帝国主义者曾经使用一切恐吓、破坏与挑拨离间的凶狠手段，来反对新中国。然而三年来，中国人民在苏联的援助下，在各人民民主国家及全世界一切爱好和平的人民的支持下，以不可被战胜的、不可被屈服的战斗意志与英雄气概，把美帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计，打得粉碎了。既然中国人民曾经击破了帝国主义在亚洲的殖民地奴役制度而建立了自己的中华人民共和国，既然中华人民共和国已经在亚洲大陆上像朝阳一般涌现出来了，它就一定要生长、开花，它就一定要成为东方各被压迫民族的鼓舞的榜样，它就一定要同苏联、同各人民民主国家、同亚洲及全世界一切爱好和平的人民在一起，担负起保卫远东和平与世界和平的责任。世界上没有一种力量，能够阻止新中国的生长、繁荣与强盛。世界上没有一种力量能够阻止新中国走向社会主义。
    中国人民正满怀着信心，向着光明的未来，勇敢前进。胜利是我们的！让我们举杯祝贺：中华人民共和国的繁荣万岁！
    中苏两国人民永久的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    中国人民的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    世界人民的领袖与导师，中国人民的最好朋友，伟大的斯大林大元帅万岁！
    苏联部长会议副主席米高扬接着举杯祝中华人民共和国的繁荣。祝中国人民的领袖毛泽东的健康。
    张大使接着频频举杯祝出席招待会的斯大林大元帅最亲密的战友苏联部长会议副主席米高扬、布尔加宁的健康；祝苏联部长会议副主席柯西金、马利雪夫和别尔乌辛的健康；祝杰出的苏联外交家，斯大林和平政策的忠实执行者苏联外交部部长维辛斯基、副部长普式金、波德切罗布的健康；祝苏联陆军部长苏联元帅华西列夫斯基、苏联元帅布琼尼的健康；祝苏军和苏军战士、海员、军官、将军、元帅们的健康；祝中苏之间贸易关系和经济合作进一步发展和巩固；祝苏联对外贸易部长库米金的健康。
    苏联部长会议副主席布尔加宁举杯说：今天伟大的中国人民所过的节日，和我们——中国人民的朋友在这里所过的节日，不仅是在东方的大事，而且是有世界意义的事件的节日。今天我们的报纸上公正地指出了这是我们的革命以后第三个重要事件：第一件是俄国十月革命，第二件是苏联卫国战争，第三件就是中国人民革命的胜利。中国人民解放军在这个胜利上起了不小的作用。这个军队是真正英勇的军队，在长时期中表现了勇敢、刚毅、自我牺牲的精神。由于它的战士和指挥员的英勇坚强，才有得到胜利的可能。就是它——中国人民解放军和中国人民粉碎了蒋介石匪帮和日本侵略者，就是它保证了中国今天所获得的一切。中国人民解放军作了伟大的事情。为中国人民解放军，为中国人民，为朱德总司令，为中国人民胜利的鼓舞者毛泽东干杯。
    苏联外交部长维辛斯基举杯说：中华人民共和国从成立以来走过了一段在国内外政策方面胜利的卓越的道路。当外交为自己的人民的希望和要求所鼓舞的时候，它就能成为积极和有效的。中华人民共和国的外交接受着引导中国人民前进的思想的鼓舞。杰出的人物，毛泽东的战友之一——周恩来领导着中国外交。为周恩来的健康，为中华人民共和国外交的成就，为在座的中国外交家张闻天大使的健康干杯。
    苏联对外贸易部长库米金举杯为中华人民共和国出色的政治家，毛泽东、周恩来的亲近战友李富春的健康干杯。
    最后，苏联部长会议副主席米高扬请大家为伟大的苏联和伟大的中国之间牢不可破的友谊干杯，为伟大的斯大林和毛泽东干杯。
    招待会在友好的气氛中进行，直至夜深才尽欢而散。
