Over the past year, newspapers like Shanghai's "Liberation Daily," "Tianjin Daily," "Hebei Daily," "Chahar Daily," "Pingyuan Daily," and "Hubei Daily" all devoted substantial space on October 12th and 13th to report on the enthusiastic study of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" by cadres in their respective regions. They also included editorials or special articles summarizing the learning experience and guiding future learning.

According to the "Tianjin Daily," after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, 42,483 cadres from various agencies, organizations, factories, schools, and hospitals in the city have organized themselves to study "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Currently, senior cadres and study instructors have completed "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," while general cadres have also completed "On Practice" and are studying "On Contradiction." The article "Summary of 'On Practice' Study by On-the-Job Cadres in Tianjin" reported that through the study of "On Practice," most cadres in the city have improved their ideological awareness, initially learned to apply Marxist-Leninist thought methods and work methods, improved their practical work, dispelled the past idea that "studying theory is irrelevant to work," and laid the foundation for future theoretical learning. Tianjin's experience is that when comrades with generally low theoretical levels study "On Practice," they must adopt a method of giving more lectures. To do a good job of lecturing, it is necessary to organize a teaching team. In addition, the learning leadership must maintain close contact with the leading cadres of various systems and grassroots units, specifically understand the ideological situation and problems in learning, criticize various erroneous ideas in learning, and promptly propose appropriate methods to promote learning and answer difficult questions in a timely manner.

Starting in early June, Hebei Province also launched a large-scale Party history learning movement. Through this large-scale Party history learning, the thinking of the vast majority of cadres has been improved. Some cadres have even improved their work due to the improvement of their ideological and theoretical level. With the development of Party history learning, various places have also successively established and improved teaching organizations for cadres' theoretical learning and accumulated experience in teaching and tutoring. A few regions have also organized formal theoretical learning for on-the-job cadres. The achievement of the above results is mainly due to the fact that Party committees at all levels regard cadres' theoretical learning as an important political task, and the vast number of cadres have improved their awareness of learning theory after the "Three-Anti" movement. Other important reasons include the establishment of the education network, the composition of the theoretical education team, and the establishment of teaching and tutoring work under unified leadership. However, in the Party history learning movement, some regions or units still have the following shortcomings: First, there is a lack of clear understanding or no serious implementation of the principle of learning Party history in order to further study and grasp the thought of combining Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese revolution and further study the Selected Works of Mao Zedong; second, there is still a lack of correct understanding of the principle of linking theory with practice in learning, let alone correct implementation. To this end, the "Hebei Daily" published an editorial on the 13th, calling on all comrades participating in the Party history learning to overcome the above shortcomings in order to ensure that the Party history learning movement achieves greater gains.

Chahar Province's organized and guided study of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" began in June of this year. Most leading cadres at all levels in the province participated in this study and became the backbone of the study and guidance groups in their respective agencies. At present, this study has achieved remarkable results. After studying "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," some leading cadres began to pay attention to strengthening investigation and research in their work and overcoming the tendency to draw hasty conclusions on issues. General cadres have also reversed their past ideas of being unwilling to go to the countryside, factories, and mines, and are willing to go to practice to work and exercise. They have also begun to overcome bureaucracy and blindness in their work, and pay attention to grasping key issues and solving major contradictions in their work methods. Many departments and cadres have combined the study of "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" to examine their work and thinking.

More than 17,400 cadres in Pingyuan Province have now participated in Party history learning and have achieved great results. Especially after studying "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," many cadres felt that their "thinking has broadened," and they have become "vigilant and overcome the subjectivity, one-sidedness, and superficiality of ideological methods," and they have initially understood the importance of proceeding from reality and making specific analyses of specific things, and understood the important role of revolutionary theory in revolutionary practice.

Since Hubei Province launched the study of communism and the Communist Party among cadres throughout the province in July of this year, a learning upsurge has been set off. According to preliminary statistics, the number of cadres currently participating in the study accounts for more than 80 percent of the total number of cadres. "Seriously reading a few books" has become a common call among cadres. In order to do a good job of the systematic theoretical study of all cadres, the "Hubei Daily" specially published a short commentary on the 12th of this month, calling on the whole province to "launch a learning competition to see who learns more and better!"

According to the Liberation Daily, cadres in East China have recently started studying Selected Works of Mao Zedong. Tan Zhenlin, the third secretary of the East China Bureau, called for the study of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" at a meeting of senior cadres of East China's first-level organs. He proposed that senior cadres should first study "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" to summarize the work experience of the past three years in order to meet the large-scale economic construction. The Party Committee of the directly affiliated organs of the East China Bureau has now stipulated that each unit should study "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" this year. The study of "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" by the directly affiliated organs of the East China Military and Political Committee and the Shanghai municipal organs will be fully launched in mid-October and early November. Other provinces and cities in East China are also actively deploying the study of "On Practice" and "On Contradiction."

### 一年来各地干部政治理论学习的情况

    一年来各地干部政治理论学习的情况
    本月十二、十三两日上海“解放日报”、“天津日报”、“河北日报”、“察哈尔日报”、“平原日报”和“湖北日报”等，都以大量篇幅报道了各该地干部一年来热烈学习“毛泽东选集”的情况，并写有社论或专文总结学习经验，指导今后的学习。
    据天津日报报道，“三反”“五反”以后，全市各机关、团体、工厂、学校、医院的干部，已有四万二千四百八十三人组织起来学习“毛泽东选集”。目前高级干部和学习辅导员已学完“实践论”和“矛盾论”，一般干部也已学完“实践论”，正在学习“矛盾论”。该报所载“天津市在职干部‘实践论’学习小结”一文报道，该市干部通过对“实践论”的学习，大多数干部提高了思想觉悟，初步学会了运用马克思列宁主义的思想方法和工作方法，改进了实际工作，打消了过去认为“学习理论和业务无关”的思想，并为今后的理论学习奠定了基础。天津市的经验是：在一般理论水平还不高的同志学习“实践论”时，必须采取多讲课的方式。要做好讲课工作，必须组织教员队伍。另外，学习的领导机构必须和各系统的领导干部及基层单位取得密切联系，具体了解学习中的思想情况和问题，批评学习中的各种错误思想，及时提出推动学习的适当办法，及时解答疑难问题。
    从六月初开始，河北全省也已展开大规模的党史学习运动。经过这次大规模的党史学习，广大干部的思想都有所提高。部分干部更由于思想理论水平提高，改进了自己的工作。随着党史学习的开展，各地还先后建立和健全了干部理论学习的教学组织，积累了教学辅导工作的经验；少数地区并组织了正规的在职干部理论学习。以上成绩的获得，主要是由于各级党委都把干部理论学习作为一个重要的政治任务，广大干部在“三反”运动后提高了学习理论的自觉性。他如教育网的建立，理论教育队伍的组成，统一领导下的教学辅导工作的建立等，都是重要原因。但是，在党史学习运动中，某些地区或某些单位，还存在着以下缺点：一、对于通过党史学习以便进一步学习与掌握马克思列宁主义和中国革命相结合的思想，进一步学习毛泽东选集的这个方针，还缺乏明确认识，或没有认真贯彻执行；二、在学习中对理论联系实际这一原则还缺乏正确的了解，更谈不到正确地贯彻。为此，“河北日报”十三日发表社论，号召全体参加党史学习的同志，必须克服上述缺点，以保证党史学习运动得到更大的收获。
    察哈尔省对于“毛泽东选集”进行有组织、有领导的学习，是从今年六月份开始的。全省各级机关大部分领导干部都参加了这一学习，并成为本机关学习辅导组中的骨干。目前，这一学习已获得了显著的成绩。在学习“实践论”和“矛盾论”后，某些领导干部开始注意加强工作中的调查研究和克服对问题草率下结论的偏向。一般干部也扭转了过去不愿下乡、下厂、下矿的思想，愿到实际中工作中去锻炼。在工作中也开始克服事务主义和盲目性，注意了抓紧关键问题、解决主要矛盾的工作方法。很多部门、干部更结合了“实践论”和“矛盾论”的学习，检查了自己的工作和思想。
    平原全省干部现已有一万七千四百多人参加党史学习，并已收到很大的成效。特别是在学习“实践论”和“矛盾论”后，不少干部感到“思路宽了”，“对思想方法的主观性、片面性和表面性有了警惕和克服”，初步懂得了从实际出发、对具体事物作具体分析的重要性，懂得了革命理论对革命实践的重要作用。
    湖北省自本年七月份在全省干部中展开关于共产主义和共产党的学习以来，已掀起了学习高潮。根据初步统计，目前参加学习的干部人数已占干部总数的百分之八十以上。“认真地读几本书”已成为干部普遍的呼声。为了搞好全体干部系统学习理论的工作，本月十二日“湖北日报”特发表短评，号召全省“开展一个学习竞赛，看谁学的更多、更好！”
    又据解放日报报道，华东区的干部最近也已开始学习毛泽东选集。华东局第三书记谭震林同志在华东一级机关高级干部会上，号召学习“毛泽东选集”。他提出高级干部要首先学习“实践论”和“矛盾论”来总结三年来的工作经验，以迎接大规模的经济建设。华东局直属机关党委会现已规定各单位在今年内学习“实践论”和“矛盾论”，华东军政委员会直属机关和上海市级各机关的“实践论”和“矛盾论”的学习，决于本月中旬和十一月初全面展开。华东其他各省市，也都在积极布置“实践论”和“矛盾论”的学习。
