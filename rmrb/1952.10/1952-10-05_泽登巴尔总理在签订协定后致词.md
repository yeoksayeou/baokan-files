Prime Minister Tsedenbal's Speech After Signing the Agreement

Mongolian People's Republic Prime Minister Tsedenbal said in his address after the signing of the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement: Respected Chairman of the Central People's Government, Comrade Premier of the Government Administration Council, Dear Comrades: Today's signing of the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement between the Mongolian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China marks a new and significant page in the history of the friendly relations between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples. For centuries, the enemies of the Mongolian and Chinese peoples – the feudal forces of Mongolia, the landlords and warlords of China, and foreign imperialists – used various methods to divide our two peoples, to make them hostile to each other, and to brutally suppress any attempt or desire of our two peoples to fight against their common enemies. The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, the concern and help of Lenin and Stalin, the brilliant leaders of the working people of the world, and the historically significant victories of the great Soviet people have created all the necessary and favorable conditions for our two peoples to grow closer to each other and to establish truly fraternal friendly relations, and for our two peoples to launch struggles against their oppressors and strive for complete victory. The Mongolian people, who have achieved and consolidated their freedom and independence thanks to the constant and great help of the Soviet people and the constant concern of Comrade Stalin, the brilliant leader of the world's people, and who have made great achievements in developing their homeland, have at all times felt the fraternal support of the great Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, headed by the long-tested great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, in their struggle to defend and consolidate their freedom and independence against the imperialist aggressors, especially the brutal Japanese imperialists. The historically significant victory of the great Chinese people and the founding of the People's Republic of China have opened a new era in the relations between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples – an era of truly fraternal and sincere friendship between our two peoples, based on the great principles of Lenin and Stalin for the friendship of the world's people. The agreement signed today, based on the principle of equality among the world's peoples, is filled with the spirit of peace and friendship between the two peoples and fully conforms to the wishes and interests of the people of the People's Republic of China and the Mongolian People's Republic. This agreement clearly demonstrates the aforementioned fraternal and sincere relationship. This relationship is established and developed on the basis of the principles of Lenin and Stalin's internationalism by the people who have been liberated from the yoke of imperialism in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by our common and sincere friend, the powerful Soviet Union. The agreement we have signed will further consolidate the friendship between our two peoples and strengthen fraternal cooperation in their struggle to build a new and happy life for the working people, and in the just struggle to safeguard and consolidate peace against the imperialist aggressors headed by the US and British imperialists. For the happiness of the two peoples and the defense of peace in the Far East, the friendship between Mongolia and China will be further developed. Please allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Government of the People's Republic of China and to Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and a sincere friend of the Mongolian people, for their concern in consolidating the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples. May the fraternal friendship and sincere cooperation between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples exist and be consolidated forever. Glory to Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people! Glory to the greatest friend and teacher of our two peoples, the brilliant leader of the working people of the world, the great standard-bearer of peace, Marshal Stalin!
