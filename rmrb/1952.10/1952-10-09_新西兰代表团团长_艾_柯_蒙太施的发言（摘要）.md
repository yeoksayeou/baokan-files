    Speech by A. K. Montieth, Head of the New Zealand Delegation (Summary)
    Fellow fighters for peace: First of all, I would like to express our infinite admiration to the Chinese people, because after such a long struggle, they have now begun to build a new China based on free and independent people. The victory of the Chinese people in overthrowing imperialism is worthy of the gratitude of the people all over the world.
    For us, we believe that there is an overriding principle in the struggle for peace in Asia and the Pacific region, that is, every country must have the right to decide its own destiny according to its own wishes, must have the right to choose a political system that can express the will of the people of that country, and must have the right to handle and manage its economy in the way it deems best, as long as it does not interfere with the freedom of other countries. However, as long as there are people in Asia who are ruled by other countries, as long as imperialism wields great power, no matter what type it is, no matter what guise it appears in, there can be no peace.
    In our country, we see that our democratic freedoms are constantly under attack, our trade unions are subject to various shackles, and our foreign policy is not determined according to the needs of the New Zealand people, but according to the needs of the US government to establish bases and seek allies. Our politicians have repeatedly proclaimed that the Soviet and Chinese fleets have sailed into many of our ports. But these rumors have gradually lost their effect, and more and more New Zealand workers realize that the real threat is at home, that is, the threat to their freedom and families, which is specifically manifested in the fact that wages have been reduced, and the things they can buy with it are getting less and less. The crisis that is gradually descending on our people is obvious, and the root cause of this crisis lies in the government's policy of preparing for war. This year, 25 million pounds have been used for direct military purposes. The age of conscription has been arbitrarily extended. We have an artillery regiment in Korea, a fighter squadron stationed in Cyprus, our navy is shelling Korean villages and cities, and New Zealanders are training and leading a battalion of Fijians in Malaya. The future outlook is to make our nation and our country more and more militarized. According to the terms of the ANZUS Treaty, we have already accepted a war obligation in advance, and on this issue, we have no freedom to judge right and wrong. For example, if the US Seventh Fleet clashes with the forces of the People's Government of China exercising their sovereignty over Taiwan, then the US government can say that they have been attacked near the coast of China, so we must assist them. According to this agreement, the United States can loudly shout that someone is invading the United States, although in fact Taiwan is thousands of miles away from US territory.
    The recent US-Australia-New Zealand conference in Honolulu best illustrates our relationship with the United States. Our Foreign Minister is said to have said after the meeting: "It is wonderful to be able to gain the trust of Mr. Acheson." How painful it is to know in advance that others are preparing to slaughter; people simply cannot believe how despicable these guys who sell out our country and people can be.
    Japanese rearmament has caused great unrest among our people. We know that the Japanese militarists' undisguised ambition to expand aggression to the South Pacific is still the same as it was in the past. There is a real danger to the security of New Zealand. We are heartened by the massive struggle of Japanese workers against the re-militarization of their country, and we recognize that their struggle is our struggle, and their struggle for peace in the streets of Tokyo is part of our struggle in New Zealand.
    We are convinced that this conference can establish a just and lasting peace among the peoples of Asia and the Pacific region. We have a responsibility to convince those who doubt our motives and sincerity, and a responsibility to guide those who have not yet seen clearly what path we must take. If we can make some progress in solving these two problems, then peace will be more guaranteed. We have already been able to declare to the world the victory of the forces of peace, and the fact that this conference can finally be held is a victory in itself.
    We from New Zealand pay tribute to the people of Asian countries, to the people who have freed themselves from foreign exploitation and oppression and gained freedom, and to the people who continue to fight against imperialism in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, and fight for the right to be free people. Their struggle is also our struggle. We assure them that we will do our best to accelerate the arrival of their independence. We will return to our country full of confidence, because what we have seen and heard in China convinces us that our position is correct. The forces of peace are getting stronger and stronger, and we must win. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 新西兰代表团团长  艾·柯·蒙太施的发言（摘要）

    新西兰代表团团长
    艾·柯·蒙太施的发言（摘要）
    各位为和平而斗争的战友们：首先我要向中国人民表示我们无限的钦佩，因为他们经过了这样长期的斗争，现在已开始在建设一个以自由独立的人民为基础的新中国了。中国人民推翻帝国主义的胜利是值得全世界人民十分感激的。
    对我们来说，我们认为在争取亚洲及太平洋区域的和平中有一个高于一切的原则，那就是每一个国家必须有权利按照自己的愿望去决定自己的命运，必须有权利选择能表达这个国家的人民意志的政体，必须有权利以自己认为最好的方式来处理及管理自己的经济，只要它不干涉到别的国家的自由。但是，只要亚洲还有被别的国家统治着的人民，只要还有帝国主义掌握大权，不论它是何种类型，不论它以何种面目出现，那就不可能有和平。
    在我国，我们看见我们的民主自由经常在遭受打击，我们的工会受到种种桎梏，我们的外交政策不是根据新西兰人民的需要来决定，而是根据美国政府建立基地和寻找同盟者的需要来决定的。我国的政客们曾屡次宣扬说苏联与中国的舰队已驶进了我们的许多港口了。但是这种谣言已逐渐不起作用，愈来愈多的新西兰工人认识到了真正的威胁就在国内，那就是对他们的自由和家庭的威胁，其具体表现是工资被降低了，拿它能买到的东西是愈来愈少了。逐渐降临到我们人民头上的危机是一望而知的，而这个危机的根源就在于政府的备战政策。本年度有二千五百万镑用于直接的军事用途。征兵年龄已被任意加长。我们有一个炮兵团在朝鲜，一个战斗机中队驻在塞浦路斯岛，我们的海军在炮轰朝鲜的乡村和城市，新西兰人在马来亚训练并带领着一营斐济人。未来的展望就是使我们这个民族和我们的国家更加走向军国主义化。按美、澳、新三国协定的条款，我们已经预先接受了一个战争的义务，而在这个问题上，我们是没有判断是非的自由的。比方说：如果美国第七舰队与中国人民政府行使他们对台湾的主权的部队发生了冲突，那么美国政府就可以说他们在中国的海岸附近受到攻击了，因此我们必须援助他们。根据这个协定，美国可以大声地喊叫说有人在侵略美国了，虽然事实上台湾去美国的领土何止万里。
    最近在檀香山召开的美、澳、新三国会议最好地说明了我们同美国的关系。我们的外交部长在会后据说曾经这样说过：“能够取得艾奇逊先生的信任真是极好的事。”事先知道了别人正在准备屠杀，这是如何令人痛心的事；人们简直不能相信，这些出卖我们国家与人民的家伙到底会堕落到什么样卑鄙的地步。
    日本重新武装，在我们人民当中引起了极大的不安。我们知道，日本军国主义者明目张胆地要把侵略扩大到南太平洋的野心，仍是一如当年的。这里存在着对新西兰安全的真正危险。我们为日本工人反对他们本国重新军国主义化的声势浩大的斗争而欢欣鼓舞，我们认识到他们的斗争就是我们的斗争，他们在东京街头所进行的争取和平的斗争，也就是我们在新西兰所进行的斗争的一部分。
    我们深信这次会议能够在亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民中建立一个公正和持久和平的基础。我们有责任说服那些怀疑我们的动机和诚意的人，有责任指引那些还没有看清楚我们必须走怎样的道路的人。假如我们能够对于解决这两个问题做出一些成绩来，那末和平就更加有保证了。我们已经能够向世界宣布和平力量的胜利，这个会议终于能够召开这件事情本身就是一个胜利。
    我们来自新西兰的人向亚洲各国人民致敬，向那些已摆脱外国的剥削和压迫而得到自由的人民致敬，向那些在朝鲜、越南和马来亚继续向帝国主义作斗争，为了争取作自由人的权利而斗争的人民致敬。他们的斗争也就是我们的斗争。我们向他们保证，我们一定要尽最大的力量来加快他们独立的到来。我们将充满着信心回到我们祖国，因为我们在中国的所见所闻使我们确信我们的立场是正确的。和平的力量是愈来愈强大的，我们一定要胜利。（新华社）
