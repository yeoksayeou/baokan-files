Xinhua News Agency Report: Delegations attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held a song and dance soiree in Beijing on the evening of the 17th. Participating in the performances were representatives from Burma, Canada, Ceylon, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Thailand, and the United States. Some of them were famous actors, musicians, and dancers, but the vast majority were not actors and were participating in a performance for the first time.

The programs performed by the delegates all had strong national characteristics. The Japanese delegates' musical programs mostly had folk song flavors. Nakamura Kanzaburo, a famous Japanese actor, sang "Chichibu Song," which described the labor process from raising silkworms, reeling silk, weaving cloth to selling silk fabrics. The song was light and cheerful. "Song of the Landless Peasant," sung by Kediche Bose, a famous musician from West Bengal, India, depicted a landless peasant who could not find work anywhere and did not know what his future would be, but the answer he finally found for himself was: unite and fight together for freedom and peace. Ms. Rohini Bhate, a famous Indian dancer, performed "Welcome Dance" and "Dove of Peace Dance" with the style of South Indian classical dance, and the audience applauded warmly for a long time at the end. In addition, the "Qinglian Dance" performed by Thai female representatives Nik Pongpib and Ramshak Saengthon, and the dances of representatives from Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, and other countries, were also rich in national characteristics. Many of the evening's programs were newly created by the delegates themselves. These programs sang the praises of peace, international solidarity, and friendship. The "Song of Peace" sung by the Burmese delegates in chorus was composed by Maung Hla, a member of the Burmese delegation and a composer. This song praised the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and praised the struggling people of Vietnam, Malaya, and Korea. Mrs. Nagammah Vikuntawasan, a female representative from Ceylon, sang a song she recently composed to pay tribute to Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people. The Ceylon delegates also sang a "Feridu" in chorus, praising the successful conclusion of the Peace Conference and the glory of Chairman Mao Zedong. One of the songs sung by Indian representative Bose as a solo was a song praising the deep friendship between the Chinese and Indian people, entitled "Sino-Indian Friendship Song." These songs were greatly loved by the audience. A chorus by representatives from India and Pakistan was greatly welcomed by the audience. The two delegations, which were closely united during the Peace Conference, sang in a strong and united voice praising the unity of the Indian and Pakistani people and the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The audience also welcomed the performance of Filipino representative Cruz with great enthusiasm. In addition to singing Filipino folk songs, he also sang the song of the Chinese People's Volunteers in not very fluent Chinese. He walked while singing, and the audience clapped and echoed with the beat. At the end of the performance, another storm of applause broke out in the audience. Finally, the Beijing Opera Experimental Third Troupe of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera performed "Water Curtain Cave," which won applause from the audience.

Xinhua News Agency Report: Representatives from more than 30 countries attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference visited 17 rural villages in the suburbs of Beijing after the land reform on the 16th.

The tremendous development of production and labor mutual aid organizations in the rural areas after the land reform aroused great attention from the representatives. The nine members of the Japanese delegation met Yin Weichen, a famous agricultural labor model, in Huangtugang Village, Fengtai District. He warmly introduced the situation of the production cooperative he led to the representatives. Di Guilin, a labor model from Dazhongsi Village in the western suburbs, harvested 470 catties of cotton per mu last year, and this year he is expected to harvest more than 600 catties per mu. Alberto Loera Juarez and Lazaro Rubio Felix, peasant leaders from Mexico, inquired about the organization of Di Guilin's mutual aid group when they visited Dazhongsi, and enthusiastically went to the fields with the members of the mutual aid group to pick cotton. Representatives from Costa Rica and El Salvador visited the electric pumping well and electric rice milling machine in Liulangzhuang with great interest. Ravi Shankar Shivram Vyas, a 67-year-old Indian representative and disciple of Gandhi, asked labor model Zhang Dequan to introduce methods of increasing production, and asked him for some eggplant seeds to take back to India. In the home of Liu Qingyuan, a liberated peasant in Xiaohongmen Village, Liu Qingyuan invited representatives from the United States and Canada to visit the new clothes he had added after liberation. He repeatedly said: Thank you, Chairman Mao, we have been liberated. Canadian representative Mackendrick asked him to take a photo, and another representative sighed: Unfortunately, the photo can only show his image, but not his joyful mood and voice. Liberated peasant Tian Dechang pointed to the five Western-style houses he had received in the land reform with a smile, and talked about his happy life today. Nakamura Kanzaburo, the acting head of the Japanese delegation, was moved to tears. Dharma Ratana, the head of the Ceylon delegation, looked at the children happily jumping and singing in the Bajiaocun Primary School and said with emotion: Ceylon also has schools, but only the children here are happy. Only in peaceful days can such a happy life be built.

Representatives from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and other countries had an extremely enthusiastic gathering with the peasants of Tiancun in Shijingshan District. On the clean streets, people shouting "Long Live Peace" flocked to the representatives who had just got off the bus. Wherever the representatives went, they were accompanied by warm applause. Colombian representative Bayona found Wang Yunquan, a primary school student who had made a cardboard pony for the peace representatives from the crowd. He expressed his gratitude with a warm hug and kiss, and took out a peace medal from his body and put it on Wang Yunquan. Finally, in the square, a representative played the six-stringed guitar, and Sherve, a middle-aged Ecuadorian representative and female lawyer, waved a colorful handkerchief and danced an Ecuadorian folk dance with Professor Cabezas. Several representatives then joined the enthusiastic dance, and the people standing on the side clapped and echoed rhythmically. The sound of music, applause, and cheers resounded.

Xinhua News Agency Report: Journalists from 15 countries attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held a forum with Chinese journalists and people from the publishing and printing industries on the 18th. The forum was presided over by Fan Changjiang, director of the preparatory committee of the Chinese News Publishing and Printing Workers Union. At the meeting, journalists from various countries raised some questions about the new China's news publishing and printing industry, which were answered by people from the Chinese news publishing and printing industry. At the meeting, everyone stood up and paid tribute to the journalists who were persecuted in capitalist countries for their efforts in the cause of peace.

Xinhua News Agency Report: About 30 representatives from various countries attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held a forum with Chinese legal workers on the 18th. The forum was presided over by Shen Junru, deputy director of the preparatory committee of the China Political Science and Law Society.

    和平会议代表在京举行联欢、访问和座谈
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各国代表团于十七日晚间在北京举行歌舞联欢晚会。参加表演的有缅甸、加拿大、锡兰、智利、中国、哥伦比亚、哥斯达黎加、厄瓜多尔、印度、印度尼西亚、日本、墨西哥、巴基斯坦、秘鲁、菲律宾、泰国、美国等国的代表。他们当中有些是著名的演员、音乐家、舞蹈家，但是，绝大部分不是演员，而且都是第一次参加表演。
    代表们表演的节目都带有强烈的民族情调。日本代表表演的音乐节目大部分都有民谣风味。日本著名演员中村玩右卫门唱了“秩父之歌”，有一段叙述了从养蚕、缫丝、织布到出售丝织品的劳动过程，歌曲轻松而且愉快。印度西孟加拉省名音乐家克迪希·鲍斯唱的“无地农民之歌”描写了一个无地的农民到处找不到工作，不知道他的前途怎样，但他最后给自己找到的答复是：联合起来共同为自由与和平而斗争。印度名舞蹈家萝希妮·巴德女士在会上表演了有南印度古典舞风的“欢迎舞”以及“和平鸽之舞”等节目，终场时全场热烈鼓掌，经久不息。此外，泰国女代表匿·蓬碧和蓝芍·飒顺吞表演的“清莲舞”，智利、哥斯达黎加、墨西哥等国代表的舞蹈，也富有民族特色。晚会节目有许多是代表们自己新近创作的。这些节目歌唱了和平、国际团结和友好。缅甸代表们合唱的“和平之歌”，就是由缅甸代表团团员、作曲家貌新作曲的。这首歌颂扬了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，并赞美了斗争中的越南、马来亚和朝鲜人民。锡兰女代表娜加玛·维昆塔瓦桑夫人演唱了她最近创作的一首向中国人民领袖毛泽东致敬的歌。锡兰代表们还合唱了一首“费利杜”，歌唱和平会议的胜利闭幕和毛泽东主席的光荣。印度代表鲍斯独唱的节目中，有一首是歌颂中国人民和印度人民的深厚友情的，歌名是“印中友好歌”。这些歌曲都受到观众的很大喜爱。印度和巴基斯坦两国代表的一个合唱受到全场的极大欢迎。这两个在和平会议期间紧密团结起来的代表团，用坚强一致的声音歌颂了印巴人民的团结和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。观众也用巨大的热情欢迎了菲律宾代表柯鲁兹的表演。他除了演唱菲律宾的民族歌曲外，还操着不十分纯熟的中国话唱了中国人民志愿军战歌。他一边唱一边走着步伐，全场观众也随着节拍鼓掌应和。终场时全场上又爆发出暴风雨般的掌声。晚会最后由中国戏曲研究院京剧实验第三团演出“水帘洞”，获得了全场的鼓掌欢迎。
    【又讯】出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的三十多个国家的代表，在十六日分别参观了北京近郊土地改革后的十七个农村。
    土地改革后的农村的生产和劳动互助组织的巨大发展，引起了代表们的极大注意。日本代表团的九位团员在丰台区的黄土岗村会晤了著名的农业劳动模范殷维臣。他热情地向代表们介绍了他领导的生产合作社的情况。西郊大钟寺村劳动模范狄桂林去年每亩田收获了四百七十斤棉花，今年每一亩田预计要收获六百多斤。来自墨西哥的农民领袖阿尔伯托·洛埃拉·胡阿利兹和拉沙罗·卢比奥·费利克斯在访问大钟寺的时候，询问了狄桂林互助组的组织，并热情地和互助组的组员们一起到田里去摘棉花。哥斯达黎加和萨尔瓦多等国的代表极感兴趣地参观了六郎庄的电机抽水井和电动辗米机。六十七岁的印度代表、甘地门生拉维·山加尔·史佛兰姆·维亚斯请劳动模范张德全介绍增产方法，并向他索取了一些茄子的种子准备带回印度去。在小红门村翻身农民刘庆源的家里，刘庆源请美国和加拿大代表参观他在解放后添置的新衣物，他连声地说：谢谢毛主席，我们翻身了。加拿大代表马肯辑请他拍了一张照片，另一位代表感叹地说：遗憾的是拍照只能照出他的形象，不能照出他欢乐的心情和声音。翻身农民田德常喜笑颜开地指着土地改革中分得的五间西式大北房，谈起今天的幸福生活。日本代表团代理团长中村玩右卫门为之感动得流下泪来。锡兰代表团团长达马拉塔纳法师望着八角村小学里欢乐地跳着唱着的孩子们，感慨地说：锡兰也有学校，但只有这里的儿童是幸福的。只有在和平的日子里，才能建设这样幸福的生活。
    来自哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔和秘鲁等国的代表们，和石景山区田村的农民作了一次极热情的聚会。在整洁的街道上，欢呼着“和平万岁”的人们涌向刚下车的代表。代表们每走到一处地方，都伴随着热烈的欢迎掌声。哥伦比亚代表巴约纳从人群中找到了为和平代表做了一只板纸小马的小学生王蕴泉，他用热情的拥抱和亲吻表示他的感谢，并从身上取下一个和平纪念章为王蕴泉佩上。最后，在广场上，
    一个代表弹起了六弦琴，中年的厄瓜多尔代表、女律师雪尔伐挥动着彩色的手巾，与大学教授卡贝萨斯跳起了厄瓜多尔的民族舞蹈，好几个代表接着也参加到热情的舞蹈中，站在一旁的人们有节奏地鼓掌相和，音乐声、掌声和欢呼声响成一片。
