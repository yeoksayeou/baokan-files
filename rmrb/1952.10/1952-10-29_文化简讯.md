    Cultural Briefs

    The theoretical study for cadres currently employed by the direct organs of the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau and the Central-South Military and Political Committee has formally commenced.

    In order to welcome the upcoming large-scale economic construction of the motherland, the Party Committee of the direct organs of the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau, according to the instructions of the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau, has arranged the theoretical study for cadres currently employed by the direct organs of the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau and the Central-South Military and Political Committee from October 15th to the end of January next year. Currently, all cadres of the direct organs have been organized into advanced, intermediate, and elementary theoretical study groups or cultural study classes through self-reporting, public discussion, organizational review, and approval. Cadres participating in the elementary group will primarily study "Common Knowledge of Politics Reader." Participants in the intermediate group will primarily study "Socialism and Communism" by Soviet scholar Dr. Yudin. Participants in the advanced group will formulate their own study plans and self-study certain articles from "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" or "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction"; those who have not studied "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" will first study these two important essays. This group's study will be directly guided by the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau. The Party Committee of the direct organs of the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau has hired several responsible Party and government comrades as lecturers to teach the theoretical instructors and study guides; and has selected more than 150 Party member cadres with higher cultural levels and better theoretical cultivation from various departments to serve as theoretical instructors, responsible for imparting the courses taught by the lecturers, explaining and answering questions to the cadres in their respective departments; and has also selected more than 400 active Party member cadres from all levels of students to serve as study guides, conducting study tutoring under the guidance of Party committees and theoretical instructors at all levels.
