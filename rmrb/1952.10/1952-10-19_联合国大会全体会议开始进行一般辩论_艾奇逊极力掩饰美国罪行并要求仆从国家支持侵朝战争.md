Xinhua News Agency, New York, 18th. TASS reports: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the 16th to begin the general debate. Representatives from Cuba, Sweden, Chile, Iraq, New Zealand, Argentina, Afghanistan, and the United States spoke at the meeting in succession.

    The Iraqi representative said: "Opposition to foreign rule is a common occurrence in Asia and parts of Africa at present." He pointed out that Iraq supports including the Tunisian and Moroccan questions on the Assembly's agenda.

    The New Zealand representative complained that only a few countries were forced to bear the majority of the burden of the Korean War, and the vast majority of UN member states adopted a cold attitude towards the "collective action" in Korea. He said that the governments of the countries participating in the Korean War were willing to end the war.

    The Argentine representative called for attention to the interests of underdeveloped countries. He said that a large part of the world's resources are used to produce weapons of war, which hinders the economic development of underdeveloped countries.

    In his speech, the Afghan representative urged the major powers to resolve their differences peacefully and strive to make decisions that everyone agrees with.

    The next speaker was the US Secretary of State Acheson. On the one hand, he used rhetoric to say that the United States was working hard to seek a peaceful resolution to international conflicts, and on the other hand, he praised the intervention in Korea, demanding that America's vassal states display a firm and consistent spirit and support the "common effort" in Korea.

    Although world public opinion is demanding a firm condemnation of the use of bacteriological weapons, Acheson in his speech only mentioned that the United States "will never commit aggression with atomic bombs...chemical weapons or bacteriological weapons." He wanted to evade the issue with this sentence. Acheson did not condemn the use of bacteriological and chemical weapons, regarding such weapons as the most barbarous and inhumane instruments of war, and he did not even mention a word about the prohibition of atomic weapons.

    Acheson then talked about the issue of disarmament, praising the US proposal in the United Nations Disarmament Commission, and trying to cover up the fact that this proposal only advocated setting "maximum limits" on the number of armed forces and attempting to replace the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons with the issue of "reporting and reviewing" information on armaments and armed forces.

    He hypocritically said that the US government is willing to help the people of colonies and dependent countries achieve autonomy and improve their living conditions. However, he also said that the process by which these people gain autonomy is a very long process. He called for "mutual understanding" to be established between the colonizers and the people under their rule.

    Afterwards, the General Assembly proceeded to discuss the agenda of the Seventh General Assembly and how to allocate the various agenda items to the working committees. The US-British majority group violated the UN Charter, and despite the opposition of the representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, and Belarus, it included the Austrian question and the Kuomintang elements' proposal to revise the Chinese translation of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on the agenda, although the Kuomintang elements do not represent anyone at all and have no right to propose any suggestions for the United Nations to discuss. At the same time, in order to use the United Nations flag to cover up their intervention in Korea, the US-British majority group forced the General Assembly to agree to discuss the issue of declaring those interventionist troops who died in Korea "dead for the United Nations."

    联合国大会全体会议开始进行一般辩论
    艾奇逊极力掩饰美国罪行并要求仆从国家支持侵朝战争
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会于十六日举行全体会议，开始一般辩论。古巴、瑞典、智利、伊拉克、新西兰、阿根廷、阿富汗及美国代表相继在会上发言。
    伊拉克代表说：“反对外国统治是整个亚洲与非洲的某些部分目前经常发生的事。”他指出：伊拉克赞成把突尼斯和摩洛哥问题列入大会议程。
    新西兰代表抱怨说：只有少数国家被迫承当朝鲜战争的大部分负担，联合国绝大多数会员国对在朝鲜的“集体行动”采取冷淡的态度。他说，参加朝鲜战争的国家的政府都愿结束这场战争。
    阿根廷代表要求注意落后国家的利益。他说：全世界很大一部分资源都用来生产战争武器，这妨害落后国家的经济发展。
    阿富汗代表在发言中敦促大国以和平方法解决分歧，并努力作出大家同意的决定。
    接着发言的是美国国务卿艾奇逊。他一方面花言巧语地说美国在努力争取和平解决国际冲突，一方面又颂扬干涉朝鲜的行动，他要求美国的仆从国家发挥坚定一致的精神，支持在朝鲜的“共同努力”。
    虽然全世界的舆论都要求坚决谴责使用细菌武器的行为，而艾奇逊在他的发言里仅仅提到美国“决不以原子弹……化学武器或细菌武器进行侵略”。他想用这样一句话来规避这个问题。艾奇逊没有谴责使用细菌武器和化学武器，把这种武器看作是最野蛮而惨无人道的战争工具，他并且根本连一句话也没有提到禁止原子武器。
    艾奇逊随后又谈到裁减军备问题，他赞扬美国在联合国裁减军备委员会提出的建议，极力掩饰这个建议仅仅主张规定武装部队人数的“最高限额”，并企图以“报告和审查”军备和武装部队情报的问题来代替裁减军备和禁止原子武器的问题。
    他虚伪地说美国政府愿意帮助殖民地和附属国的人民获得自治并改进生活条件。然而，他又说：这些人民获得自治的过程是一个很长很长的过程。他要求在殖民者与他们统治下的人民之间，建立“相互谅解”。
    以后大会就进而讨论第七届大会的议程以及各议事项目如何分配给各工作委员会的问题。美英多数集团违反联合国宪章，并不顾苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰和白俄罗斯代表的反对，竟把奥地利问题以及国民党分子要求修改防止与惩办集体屠杀罪公约中文译文的建议列入议程，虽然国民党分子根本不代表任何人，而且没有权利提出任何建议要联合国讨论。同时美英多数集团为了利用联合国的旗帜来掩饰他们在朝鲜的干涉行动，强使大会同意讨论宣布那些在朝鲜战死的干涉军“为联合国而死”的问题。
