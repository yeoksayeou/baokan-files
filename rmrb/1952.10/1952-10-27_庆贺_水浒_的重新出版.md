    Celebrating the Re-publication of "Water Margin"
    The classic Chinese literary masterpiece "Water Margin" has recently been re-edited and published by the People's Literature Publishing House. This is a novel depicting a peasant revolutionary struggle in the Song Dynasty (around the end of the 11th century AD); it profoundly reflects the antagonism between peasants and the landlord-bureaucratic class, enthusiastically praises the just resistance of the people, and brilliantly portrays the true faces of many heroic figures. It is an immortal realistic work and one of the outstanding literary heritages of the Chinese nation.
    "Water Margin" has been widely circulated among the Chinese people and exists in various versions. The People's Literature Publishing House studied various different versions and, for the convenience of readers, used the seventy-chapter version annotated by Jin Shengtan in the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties (17th century AD) as the base text, carefully revising it before reprinting. The absurd and reactionary annotations of Jin Shengtan were deleted from the book, and those places that he had altered for the worse were restored to their original form according to other versions. The entire book is divided into seventy-one chapters, each with illustrations, which are reproduced from the better illustrations found in various editions. The book also contains many annotations that explain some dialects, slang, and uncommon ancient usages in the book, which are helpful for readers to understand the work. However, some annotations inevitably still contain errors or are not explained clearly enough. It is hoped that the People's Literature Publishing House will widely solicit the opinions of readers and experts to make the annotations in the book more perfect.
    When reprinting this great work, the People's Literature Publishing House obtained some historical materials about Shi Nai'an. These materials all state that Shi Nai'an wrote "Water Margin." Therefore, the People's Literature Publishing House affirms that the author of this work is Shi Nai'an. However, in order to verify these materials and conduct more detailed investigation and research into Shi Nai'an's life, the Ministry of Culture has sent specialists to relevant locations to conduct further investigation. This is a very meaningful task.
    The editing and publication of "Water Margin" is one of the achievements of the People's Literature Publishing House in researching and organizing Chinese classical literature. In the future, the publishing house will successively edit and publish "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Journey to the West," "Romance of the West Chamber," "The Scholars," and other books. The research and organization of Chinese classical literature is a work that is expected by millions of people and is of historical and world significance. This work will enable readers to learn Chinese classical literature more smoothly, better inherit the Chinese national literary and artistic traditions, and enrich our new literary creations. Therefore, the editing and publication of "Water Margin" is worth celebrating.

    庆贺“水浒”的重新出版
    我国古典文学名著“水浒”最近已由人民文学出版社重新校订出版。这是一部描写宋朝一次农民革命斗争（约在公元十一世纪末）的小说；它深刻地反映了农民和地主官僚阶级的对立，热烈地歌颂了人民的正义反抗，并且出色地刻划了许多英雄人物的真实面貌。它是一部不朽的现实主义的作品，是中华民族的优秀文学遗产之一。
    “水浒”在中国民间广泛流传，并有多种版本。人民文学出版社研究了各种不同的版本，为了照顾读者阅读方便，以明末清初（公元十七世纪）金圣叹批改的七十回本为底本，慎重订正后加以重印。书中删掉了金圣叹的荒诞和反动的批语，并把那些被他改坏的地方，依照别的版本，恢复了原来的面目。全书共分七十一回，每回都有插图，是采取版本中较好的插图来复制的。该书并有许多注解，对书中一些方言、隐语和不常见的古人用语作了解释，这对读者了解这部作品是有帮助的。但有些注解不免还有错误或说得不清楚的地方，希望人民文学出版社广泛搜求读者和专家们的意见，使该书的注解能更臻完善。
    在重印这部伟大的作品时，人民文学出版社得到了关于施耐庵的一些历史材料。这些材料都说施耐庵曾著“水浒”。因此，人民文学出版社肯定这部作品的作者是施耐庵。但为了证实这些材料，并对施耐庵的生平作更详细的调查研究，中央文化部已派专人前往有关地点进行更进一步的调查。这是一件很有意义的工作。
    “水浒”的校订出版，是人民文学出版社研究和整理我国古典文学的成绩之一。今后该社将陆续校订出版“三国志演义”、“红楼梦”、“西游记”、“西厢记”、“儒林外史”等书。中国古典文学的研究、整理工作，是千万人所期望的工作，是具有历史意义和世界意义的事情。这一工作将使读者比较顺利地去学习我国古典文学，更好地继承中国民族文学艺术传统，来丰富我国新的文学创作。因此，“水浒”的校订出版，是值得庆贺的。
