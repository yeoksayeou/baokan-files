    New Developments in the Friendly Relations Between China and Mongolia
    Following intimate talks held recently in Beijing between the Chinese government and the government delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic, an economic and cultural cooperation agreement for further developing and consolidating the friendly relations between the two countries has been signed. This marks a new historical stage in the friendly cooperative relations between China and Mongolia, and it is of extreme importance for promoting the economic and cultural construction of the two countries and strengthening the friendly relations between the two peoples.
    The peoples of China and Mongolia have a long-standing historical relationship. In the past few decades, imperialism and reactionary Chinese rule attempted to sow discord in the friendship between the peoples of China and Mongolia. However, even in those days, the peoples of China and Mongolia encouraged and supported each other with their victories and struggles in the fight against common enemies. In 1939, the Mongolian people, fighting alongside the great Soviet army, defeated the adventurous invasion of the Mongolian People's Republic by the Japanese imperialist army in the Khalkhin Gol area, which was a powerful encouragement to the Chinese people who were then fighting hard against Japanese imperialism. In August 1945, the Mongolian People's Republic, together with the Soviet Union, sent troops to fight against Japan, which greatly accelerated the final collapse of Japanese imperialism, the common enemy of the peoples of China and Mongolia, the Soviet people, and the peoples of Asian countries. The great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution overthrew the rule of domestic reactionaries and imperialism in China and established a people's democratic regime that is friendly and united with the people of all countries, thus ensuring that the Mongolian People's Republic would no longer be threatened by imperialist aggression and its lackeys. The birth of the People's Republic of China has opened a new era of friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and Mongolia and laid a solid foundation for the development of friendship between the two peoples. In the three years since then, the peoples and governments of China and Mongolia have become increasingly close and united, sending delegations to visit each other constantly, enhancing mutual understanding and friendship.
    With the assistance of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic has moved from a backward and poor nomadic country, bypassing the stage of capitalist development and moving towards a socialist future. In the three years since the victory of the revolution, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, headed by the great Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the assistance and support of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, the Chinese people have completed social reforms, restoring or exceeding pre-war levels of industrial and agricultural production, and are preparing to enter large-scale economic construction. Under these circumstances, China and Mongolia need more cooperation and assistance from each other in developing their national economic and cultural construction. Therefore, Tsendenbal, Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic, led the government delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic to our capital and signed an economic and cultural cooperation agreement with our Central People's Government. The agreement stipulates: "The two contracting parties agree to establish, develop and consolidate cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Mongolian People's Republic in the fields of economy, culture, and education." This friendly cooperative relationship, fixed in the form of a treaty, not only fully conforms to the common interests of the two peoples, but will also further promote the prosperity and happiness of our two peoples.
    This friendly relationship between the peoples and governments of China and Mongolia is permanent and unbreakable. Both of our countries are countries that have achieved revolutionary victory under the influence of the great October Revolution and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet people; the people of both of our countries are people who have been liberated under the guidance of the revolutionary truth of Marxism-Leninism; both of our countries have a loyal friendship with the great Soviet Union; and the relationship between the peoples and governments of our two countries is based on the great principles of internationalism. This close and selfless friendly relationship cannot be shaken or undermined by anyone.
    While China and Mongolia, and our great ally the Soviet Union, as well as various people's democratic countries are engaged in peaceful construction, U.S. imperialism is trying to expand its war of aggression in Asia, stepping up the revival of the forces of Japanese militarism, the common enemy of the peoples of China and Mongolia and other Asian countries, and the forces of German fascism, the common enemy of the European people, dreaming of launching a new world war. In this criminal plan, the forces of Japanese militarism are妄想着relying on the new wars of aggression launched by U.S. imperialism to re-enslave the peoples of China and Mongolia and other Asian nations. Under these circumstances, the further strengthening and consolidation of the friendship between China and Mongolia will be an essential contribution to defending the cause of peace in the Far East and the world, and to strengthening the strength and unity of the world peace and democracy camp.
    We, the Chinese people, warmly support the signing of the economic and cultural cooperation agreement between China and Mongolia and express our heartfelt welcome to the government delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic headed by Prime Minister Tsendenbal. Let the peoples of China and Mongolia unite more closely around the great Soviet Union, the leader of our world peace and democracy camp, and advance together towards lasting world peace and the great future of socialism!

    中蒙两国友好关系的新发展
    我国政府与蒙古人民共和国政府代表团于最近期间在北京举行了亲密的商谈后，已签订了进一步发展及巩固两国友好关系的经济及文化合作协定。这标志了中蒙两国之间的友好合作关系已进入了新的历史阶段，它对于促进两国的经济与文化建设，加强两国人民之间的友好关系都有着极端重要的意义。
    中蒙两国人民有着长久的历史关系，过去几十年，帝国主义和中国反动统治对中蒙两国人民的友谊曾经进行挑拨离间，但即使在那样的日子里，中蒙两国人民也曾在反对共同敌人的斗争中，以自己的胜利和斗争相互鼓舞与支援。一九三九年蒙古人民与伟大的苏联军队并肩作战，在哈勒欣河一带击溃了日本帝国主义军队对蒙古人民共和国的冒险进犯，这对于当时与日本帝国主义艰苦作战的中国人民，是一个有力的鼓舞。一九四五年八月，蒙古人民共和国更曾与苏联共同出兵，对日作战，这大大地加速了中蒙两国人民和苏联人民以及亚洲各国人民的共同敌人日本帝国主义的最后崩溃。中国人民革命的伟大胜利，推翻了国内反动派和帝国主义在中国的统治，建立了与各国人民友好团结的人民民主政权，从而保障了蒙古人民共和国不再遭受帝国主义及其走狗的侵略威胁。中华人民共和国的诞生，开辟了中蒙两国人民友好合作的新时代，奠定了两国人民发展相互之间友谊的巩固基础。三年以来，中蒙两国人民和政府之间日益亲密团结，曾不断派遣代表团互相访问，增进了彼此的了解和友谊。
    蒙古人民共和国在苏联的援助下，已由落后贫困的游牧国家，越过了资本主义的发展阶段向着社会主义的前途迈进。我国人民在革命胜利三年以来，在以伟大的毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，在苏联及各人民民主国家的援助和支持下，完成了社会改革，使工农业生产都恢复或超过了战前的水平，正准备进入大规模的经济建设。在这种情形下，中蒙两国在发展国家的经济和文化建设方面都更加需要相互之间的合作与援助。因而，蒙古人民共和国总理泽登巴尔率领了蒙古人民共和国政府代表团来到我国首都，与我国中央人民政府签订了经济及文化合作协定。这个协定规定：“缔约双方同意在经济、文化、教育方面，建立、发展及巩固中华人民共和国与蒙古人民共和国间的合作。”这种以条约形式固定下来的友好合作关系不但完全符合于两国人民的共同利益，并将进一步促进我们两国人民的昌盛和幸福。
    中蒙两国人民与政府之间的这种友好关系是永久的和牢不可破的。我们两国都是在伟大的十月革命的影响下，在苏联人民的无私援助下，取得革命胜利的国家；我们两国人民都是在马克思列宁主义革命真理的指导下获得了解放的人民；我们两国对伟大的苏联都有着忠实的友谊；我们两国人民和政府间的关系是建立在伟大的国际主义原则之上的。这种亲密无私的友好关系是任何人都不能动摇和破坏的。
    在中蒙两国和我们两国的伟大盟邦苏联以及各人民民主国家正进行着和平建设的时候，美帝国主义却力图扩大在亚洲的侵略战争，加紧复活中蒙两国及亚洲各国人民的共同敌人日本军国主义势力，和欧洲人民的共同敌人德国法西斯势力，梦想发动新的世界战争。在这一罪恶计划中，日本军国主义势力正妄想着依靠美帝国主义所发动的新的侵略战争，来重新奴役我们中蒙两国及亚洲其他各国人民。在这种情形下，中蒙两国友谊的进一步加强和巩固，对于保卫远东及世界和平事业，对于加强世界和平民主阵营的力量和团结，都将是一个重要的贡献。
    我们中国人民热烈拥护中蒙两国经济及文化合作协定的签订，并对以泽登巴尔总理为首的蒙古人民共和国政府代表团表示衷心的欢迎。让我们中蒙两国人民更加紧密地团结在我们世界和平民主阵营的领导者伟大苏联的周围，向着世界的持久和平，向着社会主义的伟大前途共同前进！
