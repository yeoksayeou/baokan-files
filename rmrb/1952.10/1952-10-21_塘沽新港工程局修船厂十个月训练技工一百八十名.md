    Tanggu Xingang Engineering Bureau Shipyard Trains 180 Technicians in Ten Months

    Editor: The Tanggu Xingang Engineering Bureau Shipyard has trained 180 technical workers (including machinists, fitters, riveters, electricians, carpenters, etc.) in ten months. The training method is as follows: After apprentices arrive at the training class, they first learn basic movements through practical work. For example, fitters initially specialize in learning to use hammers, chisels, and files. The teachers who are most familiar with these three technical movements are in charge. One teacher can take care of nineteen apprentices. During the training period, technical personnel are also invited to explain mechanical knowledge to the apprentices. The depth of the curriculum content is determined by the apprentices' level of education. After apprentices have been training for more than a month, they participate in general production. In practical work, apprentices and the workers they work with sign apprenticeship contracts based on the projects they participate in. Using this method, dozens of fitters can do the work of third-grade workers after six months; riveters can lay out simple drawings; after graduating as riveters, they are proficient in using pneumatic shovels and hammers; after graduating as welders, flat and vertical welding are no problem, while horizontal and overhead welding are slightly weaker; after graduating as machinists, the tolerance of good workpieces can be within one-thousandth, or even about five ten-thousandths. These apprentices only have a training period of six months, but their skills are no lower than those of apprentices who studied for three years in the old society.

    塘沽新港工程局修船厂十个月训练技工一百八十名
    编辑同志：塘沽新港工程局修船厂在十个月的时间，先后训练出一百八十名技术工人（包括机、钳、铆、电、木等工种）。训练的方法是：学徒来到训练班之后，首先在实际工作中训练他们学会基本动作。如钳工一开始，专门学习使用鎯头、鍽铲、锉刀。担任教员的是对这三种技术动作最熟悉的老师傅。一个老师傅可以照顾十九个学徒。在训练期间也请技术人员向学徒讲解机械常识等。课程内容的深浅，是根据学徒们文化程度的高低来决定。当学徒训练到一个多月以后，即参加一般的生产。在实际工作中，学徒和一起工作的工人根据参加工作的项目而订立师徒合同。用这种方法训练出来的几十个钳工，六个月之后就可以做三级工人的活；铆工放样工可以放简单图样；铆工毕业后，使用风铲和打锤都很熟练；电焊工毕业后，平焊立焊都没有问题，横、仰焊稍差一些；机工毕业后，成绩好的活件公差数能做到千分之一，甚至到万分之五左右。这些徒工训练期限只六个月，但是，他们比旧社会学三年的徒工的技术并不低。马金城
