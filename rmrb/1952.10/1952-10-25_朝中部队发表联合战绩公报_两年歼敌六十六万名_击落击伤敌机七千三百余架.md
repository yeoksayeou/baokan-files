Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, October 24th: On October 25, 1952, marking the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea and fighting heroically alongside the Korean People's Army against the American aggressors and their accomplice troops, the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and the Command of the Chinese People's Volunteers have released a joint battle report for the past two years, stating:

For the past two years, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have closely coordinated and fought bravely, conducting five large-scale campaigns that pushed the American aggressor troops back from the Yalu River to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, liberating vast territories of North Korea. Subsequently, they continuously crushed the enemy's all-out so-called "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive," inflicting particularly heavy blows on the enemy. For over a year, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have constructed solid, deep defense lines along and north of the 38th parallel, repelling dozens of enemy attacks of various sizes every day and frequently conducting tactical counterattacks against the enemy, massively annihilating the American aggressor troops' manpower and preventing them from advancing further. At the same time, our troops fighting against the enemy air force have also achieved great victories, shooting down and damaging a large number of enemy aircraft. The U.S. imperialism has successively implemented so-called "air pressure," "strangulation warfare," "key point assault warfare," and inhumane germ warfare and gas warfare against our rear areas, but has been completely crushed by us. The barbaric actions of American aerial bandits bombing our peaceful residents have also met with tragic failure.

The past two years have proven that our army is becoming stronger and stronger in battle, gaining increasingly rich experience, and has achieved great victories, massively annihilating the enemy and crushing all the enemy's arrogant actions and conspiracies.

A summary of the main achievements of the Korean People's Army front-line troops (excluding the achievements of the second-line troops and guerrilla units behind enemy lines) and the Chinese People's Volunteers over the past two years is as follows (from October 25, 1950, to October 15, 1952):

(1) A total of 661,034 enemy troops were killed, wounded, or captured, including 291,011 American aggressor troops, 348,045 Rhee's puppet troops, 18,578 accomplice troops from Britain, Australia, Canada, etc., and 3,400 accomplice troops from Turkey, France, Thailand, the Philippines, Greece, etc.

(2) The following enemy equipment was captured: 10 aircraft, 190 tanks, 50 armored vehicles, 5,374 vehicles of various types, 3,730 guns of various types (including 423 howitzers, 139 anti-aircraft machine guns, 44 mountain guns, 372 recoilless guns, 478 mortars, and 2,274 other types of guns), 69,899 guns of various types (including 206 anti-aircraft machine guns, 5,747 light and heavy machine guns, 48,577 submachine guns, carbines, and automatic rifles, and 15,369 rifles, short guns, signal guns, etc.), over 123,460 rounds of various artillery shells, over 15,072,600 rounds of various gun bullets, over 70,650 hand grenades, over 4,600 landmines, 3,600 communication equipment of various types, and countless other military supplies.

(3) 7,323 enemy fighters, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, transport aircraft, artillery spotting aircraft, propaganda aircraft, helicopters, etc. were shot down or damaged (including 3,804 shot down and 3,519 damaged).

(4) 2,057 enemy tanks were destroyed or damaged (including 1,537 destroyed and 520 damaged), 38 enemy armored vehicles were destroyed, 2,669 vehicles were destroyed, and over 550 guns of various types were destroyed. Over 230 enemy vehicles were damaged, 3 enemy destroyers were sunk, 2 minesweepers were sunk, 3 landing craft were sunk, and 2 enemy destroyers were damaged.
