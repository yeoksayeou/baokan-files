Visiting the Chinese Printed Book Exhibition
谢兴尧

China was the first country to invent paper and printing. These two great inventions have made tremendous contributions to the development of all human culture. In order to allow the general public to systematically see the development of Chinese printed books, the Beijing Library held the "Chinese Printed Book Exhibition" during the third National Day. This exhibition is divided into two exhibition rooms, displaying more than a thousand kinds of ancient and modern Chinese printed books. These printed books not only demonstrate the many great creations of the Chinese people in printing technology, but also illustrate the history of the development of Chinese printing technology in various eras and regions.

Before the invention of paper and printing, the earliest Chinese characters were either carved on tortoise shells and animal bones, namely "oracle bone script"; or cast or carved on bronze ware, namely "bronze inscriptions"; later, there were those carved on stone, such as "Stone Drum Inscriptions"; and those carved on jade tablets, such as "Cursing the Chu." During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, books were written on silk fabrics and bamboo or wooden slips, as the ancients said, "Recorded on bamboo and silk." The first cabinet of this exhibition is "Oracle Bones" and "Bamboo Slips" (approximately 1300-100 BC). "Oracle bones" were carved on tortoise shells or animal bones with knives, and "Bamboo Slips" were written on wooden or bamboo pieces with brushes and bound together with ropes, as they were formerly called. In addition to three or five real "Bamboo Slips," there is also a complete "Weapon Register," which is a replica of the original slip made of more than seventy wooden slips. Below are manuscripts and photographs from the Northern Wei, Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties. The manuscripts are mostly Buddhist scriptures, and the photographs include the Diamond Sutra of the ninth year of Xiantong in the Tang Dynasty (868 AD) and the almanac of the fourth year of Qianfu (877 AD), all of which are world-renowned precious cultural relics.

China is one of the ancient countries with the longest history and culture in the world, and its cultural heritage is the richest. Unfortunately, many valuable ancient cultural relics have been plundered by imperialism during the period of reactionary rule. The "rubbings" and "photographs" displayed in the exhibition precisely illustrate this problem. For example, "oracle bones" were unearthed in Anyang, Henan after the middle of the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. The corrupt Qing government did not pay attention to them at all, and most of them flowed into Japan through treacherous merchants. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Northwest Scientific Expedition discovered a large number of "Han Slips" from the Han Great Wall ruins near the Ejin River in western Gansu and Ningxia, totaling several thousand. The most complete of these, namely the "Weapon Register" replicated in this exhibition, and such a large batch of precious original objects, were all sent to the United States by Chiang Kai-shek. Most of the silk and Sui and Tang manuscripts unearthed in Dunhuang were also plundered and stolen by imperialist elements such as Stein, Pelliot, and Sven Hedin. For example, the original of the Diamond Sutra of the ninth year of Xiantong in the Tang Dynasty and the almanac of the fourth year of Qianfu in the Tang Dynasty mentioned above are all in the London Museum and the Paris Museum, and what we display ourselves are some "rubbings" and "photographs."

Ancient Chinese books were limited in their development due to the expensive silk and heavy slips. By 12 BC (the first year of Yuanyan of Emperor Cheng of the Western Han Dynasty), with the invention of paper, the writing of books developed greatly, making a great contribution to the spread and improvement of culture. Six hundred years later, our working people invented printing, progressing from the laborious method of copying by hand to printing dozens or hundreds of copies at the same time, which was a very important event. In the Tang Dynasty of the seventh and eighth centuries, book carving was already very common. By the time of the Five Dynasties, large-scale classics were also printed by engraving, making a leap forward in the methods of spreading and preserving culture and academics.

The most important part of the exhibition is the Song Dynasty books, which account for a large proportion (from the fourth cabinet to the nineteenth cabinet). The arrangement method is: vertically, the system is based on the era, and horizontally, the focus is on the book carving location. From many Song editions, it can be inferred that from the tenth to the fourteenth centuries, the centers of engraving were: Bianliang (Kaifeng) in the Central Plains, Hangzhou in Zhejiang, Jianyang in Fujian, and Meishan in Sichuan. These places became publishing centers due to their historical, political, and economic conditions. For example, Bianliang was the capital of the Northern Song Dynasty, Hangzhou was the capital of the Southern Song Dynasty, Sichuan was the center of the engraving industry since the Five Dynasties, and Jianyang was a region with a developed papermaking industry. In addition, books were also published in Jiangxi, Guangdong, and other places. In these eras, not only government officials carved books, but private individuals also carved books. Because of the prevalence of government and private book carving, bookstores and bookshops appeared. At that time, the Chen family and Yin family bookstores in Hangzhou and the Yu family and Yu family bookstores in Jianyang were all famous, and some of them also carved and sold their own book blocks. Many of the Song editions exhibited this time are rare books, the most famous being the "Kaibao Tripitaka" (Kaibao is the reign title of Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty. This book is the entire Tripitaka carved in Chengdu in the early Song Dynasty, which was the largest project in Song Dynasty book carving. After completion, it was sent to Kaifeng, the capital of the Song Dynasty, hence the name "Kaibao Tripitaka." The Song Dynasty once sent this book to Korea, Japan, and Vietnam), "Poems of Yu Xuanji, a Woman of the Tang Dynasty," "Jinshi Lu," and the voluminous "Zizhi Tongjian." These books, whether from the aspects of engraving, printing, paper quality, ink color, or binding, all demonstrate the great creativity and artistic genius of the Chinese working people. The location of book carving developed from Sichuan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Fujian to Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong.

Jin Dynasty printed books were rougher and less circulated. Because the Jin people lived in the north, the center of book carving was in Linfen, Shanxi - called Pingyang Prefecture during the Jin Dynasty. This exhibition includes the Jin Tripitaka, also known as the "Zhaocheng Tripitaka," which is a large Buddhist anthology, originally stored in Guangsheng Temple in Zhaocheng County, Shanxi. The carving of this scripture took thirty years from the ninth year of Huangtong to the thirteenth year of Dading (1149-1173). The style of Yuan carved editions is between Song and Jin, and the scale is larger than Jin editions. Attached to the Yuan carved edition display is the Xixia script Tripitaka. Around 1300 AD, when Xixia had already perished, this shows that the script of the Xixia people was still popular in the old territory. From the Ming books exhibited, two major features can be seen: one is that there were already a large number of movable type editions, and the other is that novels and operas already had illustrations, and the carved figures and landscapes were extremely fine, which is the most beautiful tradition of "prints." Originally, in the mid-eleventh century, Bi Sheng invented the method of printing books with clay movable type, which was another great invention of the Chinese people. Unfortunately, the books he printed no longer exist today. In the thirteenth century (early Yuan Dynasty), Wang Zhen from Shandong began to print books with wooden movable type, printing "Jingde County Chronicles," which has also been lost. Many of the movable type editions in Ming books have been passed down to the present. Books with prints, such as the displayed "Northern West Chamber," "Nanke Dream," "Military Equipment Illustrated," and "Tiangong Kaiwu," are all very exquisite works of art. In particular, "Tiangong Kaiwu" depicts various labor images of the working people, which is quite educational. Among these woodcut paintings, there are also those printed with color overprinting, which was called "Douban" overprinting at that time, which can be regarded as reaching the peak of the art of woodcut prints. In contrast, the method of "Gonghua" was invented, without using any color, but simply using the procedure of embossing to prominently display the plain white patterns on the paper, mostly white clouds, water waves, or veins on flower leaves, which contrasted with various colored pictures, making them even more exquisite and varied. This is a unique style of this era, and it has not been applied in the same way in other eras and other countries.

Qing Dynasty woodcut prints have improved in both quality and quantity compared to the past. However, since the Opium War, modern printing technology was introduced into China with the invasion of imperialism. Their letterpress printing technology was learned from China and then imported back into China, but lithography and copperplate printing were new things. Therefore, since the middle of the Qing Dynasty, Chinese printed books have undergone unprecedented changes. On the one hand, artificial engraving has changed to lithography or lead printing, and on the other hand, thread-bound books have changed to Western-style binding, and double pages have changed to single pages. Thus, the appearance of printed books has undergone major changes. Regarding the printed books of this period, in addition to books, the display also includes "Shen Bao" and "Shanghai Xinbao" in 1872 (the eleventh year of Tongzhi Renshen in the Qing Dynasty), and "Shiwu Bao" compiled by Liang Qichao, and "Xiangxue Bao" compiled by Xu Renzhu, which were the earliest newspapers and magazines.

There is also a cabinet displaying the scripts of a few ethnic minorities, among which the rarest are "Yi Script Sutra," "Manchu Romance of the Three Kingdoms," and the pictographic and phonetic characters of the Naxi script in Lijiang, Yunnan. The Naxi pictographic characters are completely primitive pictographic drawings, and the phonetic characters are spelled with letters.

The second room displays various books and periodicals from the May Fourth Movement to the present. Such as "New Youth," "Guide," "Chinese Workers," "Young Communist International" and other magazines, as well as lead-printed and mimeographed publications published in the old revolutionary base areas of Jiangxi during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, and books and periodicals published in the northwest and north China base areas during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Among these books and periodicals are books edited and proofread by Lu Xun himself. In addition, the publications of new China since the founding of the People's Republic of China are also displayed. These publications have not only far exceeded the past in quantity, but also unprecedentedly improved in quality. The compilation and printing of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is the most significant example.

    参观中国印本书籍展览
    谢兴尧
    我国是发明纸张及印刷术最早的国家。这两个伟大的发明，对于整个人类文化的发展是有极大的贡献的。为了使一般人系统地看到我国印本书籍发展的情况，北京图书馆在第三届国庆节，举办了“中国印本书籍展览”。这个展览分两个陈列室，共展出中国古代和现代印本书一千多种。这些印本一方面表现了中国人民在印刷术上的许多伟大创造，一方面也说明了中国印刷术在各个时代各个地区的发展历史。
    在没有发明纸张及印刷术之前，我国最早的文字有的是刻在龟版和牛骨上，即“甲骨文”；有的则铸在或刻在青铜器上，即“钟鼎文”；其后，有刻在石上的，如“石鼓文”；刻在玉版上的，如“诅楚文”。在春秋战国的时候，书籍是写在缣帛上和竹简或木简上的，即古人所说的“垂之竹帛”。这次展览的第一柜是“甲骨”和“简牍”（约公元前一三○○年至一○○年），“甲骨”是用刀刻在龟甲或牛骨上的，“简牍”即旧来所说的竹简，是用笔写在木片或竹片上而用绳子编起来的。“简牍”除了三五片真的以外，还有一本完整的“兵器簿”，是用七十多根木简摩仿原简编成的。以下是北魏、隋、唐、五代的写本和照片，写本大都是佛经，照片有唐咸通九年（公元八六八年）的金刚经，及乾符四年（公元八七七年）的历书等，都是著名世界的珍贵文物。
    我国是世界上历史文化最悠久的古国之一，文化遗产最丰富。可惜有很多宝贵的古代文物，在反动统治时期，已被帝国主义所掠夺，展览会中所陈列的“摩本”和“照片”，正说明这个问题。如“甲骨”在清光绪中叶以后即在河南安阳出土，腐朽的清朝政府毫不加以重视，大部分经过奸商流入日本。抗战前西北科学考察团在甘肃、宁夏西部额济纳河附近，从汉长城遗址发现了大批的“汉简”，共有数千根之多，其中最完整的，即这次展览中所摩仿的“兵器簿”，而这样一大批珍贵原物，都由蒋匪送往美国。敦煌出土的缣和隋、唐写本，绝大部分也早由帝国主义分子斯坦因、伯希和、斯文赫定等掠夺盗走。如上述照片中的唐咸通九年金刚经，及唐乾符四年历书等，原本都在伦敦博物馆和巴黎博物院，我们自己所陈列的倒是些“摩本”和
    “照片”。
    中国古代书籍，因缣贵而简重，在文化的发展上不能不受限制。到了公元前十二年（西汉成帝元延元年）由于纸张发明，写本书籍随之大量发展，在文化的传播与提高上，有很大的贡献。六百年之后，我们的劳动人民又发明了印刷术，由一个人用手辛勤抄录的方法，进步到同时可以印刷几十部几百部，这是一个极重要的事件。在七、八世纪的唐朝，刻书已很普遍，到了五代的时候，巨帙长篇的经典，也都雕版印行，使文化学术的传播和保存方法有了飞跃的进步。
    展览中最重要的部分是宋本书籍，它占了很大的比重（由第四柜到十九柜）。排列的方法：纵的方面以时代为系统，横的方面以刻书地点为中心。从许多宋版书中，可以推断由十世纪到十四世纪，雕版的中心是：中原的汴梁（开封）、浙江的杭州、福建的建阳、四川的眉山等处。这些地方之所以成为出版中心地区，都有其历史的、政治的、经济的条件。如汴梁是北宋的都城，杭州是南宋的都城、四川从五代时起，就是雕版事业的重心，建阳是造纸工业发达的区域，此外如江西、广东等地，也有刻本书出版。在这些时代，不仅官家刻书，私人也刻书，因为政府和民间刻书的盛行，于是便有书坊、书肆的出现。当时如杭州陈氏、尹氏的书铺，建阳余氏和虞氏的书铺、都是有名的，他们有的还自刻书版印售。这次展出的宋本，珍本很多，最有名的如“开宝藏”（开宝是宋太祖年号。这书是宋初在成都刻的全部大藏经，是宋朝刻书中最大的工程。刻成后送至宋京开封，所以称为“开宝藏”。宋朝曾将此书送给朝鲜、日本、越南诸国），“唐女郎鱼玄机诗”，“金石录”及卷帙繁多的“资治通鉴”等。这些书无论从雕版、印刷、纸质、墨色以及装订等方面，都表现了中国劳动人民的伟大创造力和艺术天才。刻书地点由四川、浙江、江苏、安徽、福建，发展到湖北、湖南、广东。
    金朝的印本书较粗，而流传甚少。因金人偏居北方，刻书的中心在山西临汾——金时称平阳府。这次展出的有金藏，又称“赵城藏”，是一部佛教大丛书，原存山西赵城县广胜寺。这部经的雕版，从金皇统九年到大定十三年（一一四九年——一一七三年），经过三十年才刻成。元刻本的风格在宋、金之间，规模较金本为大。附于元刻本陈列的有西夏文大藏经，在公元一三○○年左右，当时西夏已亡，这说明西夏民族的文字仍在旧土流行。从展出的明本书籍中，可以看出两大特色：一是已有了大量的活字版，一是小说戏曲已带插图绘象，所刻人物山水都极精细，为“版画”中最优美的传统。本来在十一世纪中叶，毕升就发明了用泥土活字版印书的方法，这又是中国人民的一个伟大发明。可惜他所印的书，今日已不存在了。至十三世纪（元朝初年）山东人王桢又开始用木制活字印书，印有“旌德县志”，也早已失传。明本中的活字本，流传到现在的还很多。附有版画的书，如陈列的“北西厢”、“南柯梦”、“军器图说”、“天工开物”等，都是很精美的艺术品。尤其是“天工开物”画出劳动人民的各种劳动形象，颇富于教育意义。在这些木刻画中还有用彩色套印的，当时叫做“饾版”套印法、可算已达到木刻印本艺术的高峰。与此相反的又发明了“拱花”的方法，不用任何色彩，只是用压印的手续，把素白的花纹凸出地显现纸上，多半是白云、水波或花叶上的脉络，与各种彩色画面相衬托，更显得精采而多变化。这是这个时代独具的作风，在别的时代和别的国家里，还不曾同样地应用过。
    清代的木刻印本，无论在质和量那一方面，都较从前提高了一步。但自鸦片战争以后，近代印刷术跟着帝国主义的侵入而输入中国，他们的活字印刷术，是从中国学去又倒输入到中国来的，但石印和铜版印刷术，则是新的东西。因此，自清中叶以后，中国的印本书籍，起了空前的变革，一面由人工雕版变为石印或铅印，一面由线装改为洋装，由双页改为单页，于是印本书的面貌，起了重大的变化。关于这一时期的印本，陈列的除书籍外，还有一八七二年（清同治壬申十一年）的“申报”和“上海新报”，及梁启超编的“时务报”，徐仁铸编的“湘学报”等，都是最早的报纸杂志。
    还有一柜陈列着少数兄弟民族的文字，其中最少见的如“彝文经”，“满文三国志演义”及云南丽江么些文的象形字和标音字。么些的象形字完全是原始的图画象形，标音字则系用字母拼音。
    第二室陈列着自五四运动至现在的各种书刊。如“新青年”、“向导”、“中国工人”、“少年共产国际”等杂志，及第二次国内革命战争时期江西老根据地出版的铅印和油印出版物，和抗日战争时期西北及华北各根据地所出版的书刊。这些书刊中有鲁迅亲手编校的书籍。此外还陈列了中华人民共和国成立以来新中国的出版物，这些出版物不仅在量上远远超过过去，在质上也空前提高，如“毛泽东选集”的编印，便是最显著的例子。
