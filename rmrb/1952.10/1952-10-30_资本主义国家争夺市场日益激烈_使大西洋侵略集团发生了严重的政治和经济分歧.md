Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 25th: TASS reports that representatives of American political and business circles acknowledge that the increasingly acute struggle for markets among the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, and Japan has brought many serious political consequences to the Atlantic bloc. The major capitalist countries are currently facing pressing "market" problems. American financial, industrial, and government figures are engaged in heated discussions on this issue. Participants in the discussions point out that it is necessary to resolve the economic and trade relations between the United States and its partners in Western Europe and the Pacific region as soon as possible due to the following circumstances:

    I. The return of Germany and Japan to the world market, whose competition not only jeopardizes the economic position of Britain and France but also affects American manufacturers.

    II. The decrease in American exports in recent months.

    III. The strengthening of trade barriers in various countries has created new obstacles to the development of international trade.

    IV. The long-standing serious dollar deficit of Britain, France, and Japan due to artificial dependence on American imports.

    V. The American-imposed policy of economic blockade against the Soviet Union, China, and the Eastern European People's Democracies has increasingly aroused resentment in Western European countries and Japan.

    VI. American taxpayers are increasingly dissatisfied with having to bear the burden of American subsidies for exports to Western European countries and Japan, which have been carried out for several years in the name of the Marshall Plan and so-called foreign aid.

    VII. Some Americans predict that the resolutions of the upcoming (November) Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference may trigger a serious crisis in Anglo-American trade relations.

    "Business Week," the mouthpiece of the American business community, believes that the issue of adjusting economic and trade relations between capitalist countries is becoming increasingly urgent and important.

    An editorial in "Commerce Daily" on October 22nd stated: Competition for markets is already fierce enough in some important trade centers, and it is merely wishful thinking to hope that this competition will not continue to intensify.

    American economist Chilni similarly wrote in a recent issue of "Commercial and Financial Chronicle": Dissatisfaction is growing in Western Europe due to America's unwillingness to import European goods.

    Detroit Bank General Manager Dodge, speaking at the American Bankers Association meeting in Atlantic City, gave a rather pessimistic assessment of the results of the Marshall Plan and other forms of so-called "American foreign aid." He said: "If you realistically assess the international situation, then the number and scope of political misunderstandings on financial, trade, and economic issues will greatly shock you. Even if success has been achieved in certain regions, difficulties have arisen in other areas. In some cases, the difficulties have reached a dangerous level. It is quite clear that we are living in an atmosphere of impending disaster."

    "Business Week" said: If the United States does not reach an agreement with its allies on formulating a long-term plan to consolidate their economic relations – at least to consolidate their political relations – it will be difficult to avoid the disintegration of the Atlantic alliance. According to "Business Week," two political factions have formed among American business figures. Representatives of the first faction believe that the United States should stop its so-called "economic aid" to its allies and tell them to find ways to live on their own and balance their payments. Representatives of the second faction believe that the consequences of this approach are very dangerous. They believe that this will not only cause social unrest within America's allies but also give these countries an excuse to expand trade with socialist camp countries, thereby establishing "close-knit trade groups." These two factions represent different bourgeois groups in America. Representatives of powerful financial and industrial monopolies controlling the steel, coal, oil, chemical, and automobile industries, and with huge investments abroad, support the second faction with a vast imperialist plan to establish an international economy under American control. It is this group's representatives who most firmly advocate an economic blockade against the socialist camp countries.

    As for the first faction, they are supported by industrial representatives who fear foreign competition more than anyone else and therefore firmly advocate maintaining high protective tariffs. This faction is also supported by those bourgeois groups most affected by inflation. Representatives of this group advocate a more "flexible and moderate" policy toward trade with socialist camp countries.

    Despite cries that America's financial and trade problems "urgently need to be resolved," it is clear that no one imagines that the American government or Congress will take any new important measures on this issue.

    At the same time, news received by the United States indicates that financial and industrial figures in Western European governments are now drafting their own plans to "fundamentally solve" the dollar deficit problem, which the new American president will have to address after entering the White House. The news also points out that these European "honored" guests will at least demand that the United States lower tariffs, simplify the tariff system, and conclude agreements to stabilize the prices of the most important raw materials. If the American government refuses to agree to these demands, then some Western European countries will threaten the United States that they will be forced to establish "exclusive trade zones" or expand trade with the socialist camp countries.

    According to American newspaper reports, Churchill will visit Washington next March after the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference makes its resolutions. Before leaving Britain, he will meet with the prime ministers of France and Italy and present a plan to the new American president on behalf of "all" of Western Europe to solve the dollar problem.

    The increasingly serious political and economic divisions between Britain and the United States have made people doubt whether they can conclude important trade and financial agreements.

    In light of these contradictions and divisions, even publications like the London financial district's organ "The Economist" say: Eliminating the dollar deficit is no less important than producing the atomic bomb; if countries kill each other in trade, then it will be impossible to be allies in politics and military affairs.

### 资本主义国家争夺市场日益激烈  使大西洋侵略集团发生了严重的政治和经济分歧

    资本主义国家争夺市场日益激烈
    使大西洋侵略集团发生了严重的政治和经济分歧
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社纽约二十五日讯：美国政治界和工商界代表承认，美国、英国、法国、西德和日本日益尖锐的争夺市场的斗争给大西洋集团带来了许多严重的政治后果。主要的资本主义国家目前碰到迫切的“市场”问题。美国的金融界、工业界和政府人士正在对这个问题展开热烈的讨论。参加讨论的人们指出：由于下述情况，有必要尽早解决美国及其西欧和太平洋区域的小伙伴之间的经济与贸易的关系问题。这些情况便是：
    一、德国和日本回到世界市场中来，它们的竞争不但危及了英国和法国的经济地位，并且也影响了美国厂商。
    二、近几个月来美国出口的减少。
    三、各国贸易壁垒的加强造成了国际贸易发展的新障碍。
    四、英国、法国和日本由于人为的对美国进口的依赖而长期存在的严重的美元赤字。
    五、美国强制实施的对苏联、中国和东欧人民民主国家实行经济封锁的政策，已日益引起西欧各国和日本的愤慨。
    六、美国纳税人愈来愈不满要他们负担美国对输往西欧各国与日本的出口的补助，这种补助几年来都是以马歇尔计划和所谓对外援助的名义进行的。
    七、美国有人预料，下月（十一月）召开的英联邦总理会议的决议可能引起英美贸易关系上的严重危机。
    美国工商界的喉舌“商业周刊”认为调整资本主义国家间的经济和贸易关系问题愈来愈迫切和重要了。
    “商务日报”十月二十二日社论说：在某些重要贸易中心，争夺市场的竞争已经是够激烈的了，希望这种竞争不再继续加剧只是主观愿望。
    美国经济学家齐尔尼在最近一期的“商业与财政纪事”中也同样写道：由于美国不愿输入欧洲货物而造成的不满情绪在西欧日益增长。
    底特律银行总经理道奇在大西洋城举行的美国银行家协会会议上发言时，对于马歇尔计划和其他方式的所谓“美国对外援助”的结果给予一个相当悲观的评价。他说：“如果你现实地来估计国际形势的话，那末，在金融、贸易和经济问题上的政治误解的数量之多与范围之广将使你大为震惊。即使在某几个地区内获得了成功，但是在其他区域内又已经产生了困难。在某些情况之下，所产生的困难竟达到危险的程度。十分明显，我们是生活在一个大难当头的气氛中。”
    “商业周刊”说：如果美国不和它的盟国就制订一个巩固它们的经济关系的长期计划获致协议——至少要巩固它们的政治关系，要想避免大西洋联盟的瓦解是很困难的。据“商业周刊”说，在美国商业界人士中间已经形成了两种政治派别。第一派的代表认为美国应该停止给它的盟国的所谓“经济援助”而叫它们自己设法生活下去并去平衡收支。第二派的代表认为这个路线的后果是十分危险的。他们认为这不仅会在美国的盟国内部引起社会动乱，而且会给这些国家以一个与社会主义阵营国家扩大贸易从而建立“关系密切的贸易集团”的藉口。这两派代表着美国不同的资产阶级集团。控制着钢铁、煤、石油、化学和汽车工业并且在国外拥有巨额投资的强大金融与工业垄断公司的代表，以建立美国控制下的国际经济的庞大帝国主义计划来支持第二派。正是这个集团的代表们极其坚决地主张对社会主义阵营国家实行经济封锁政策。
    至于第一派，支持他们的是那些比任何人都怕外国竞争因而坚决主张维持高额保护关税的工业代表。支持这一派的还有那些受通货膨胀影响最大的资产阶级集团。这一集团的代表们主张对社会主义阵营国家的贸易采取比较“灵活和缓和”的政策。
    尽管人们叫喊着说美国的财政和贸易问题“极需解决”，但是，显然没有一个人幻想美国政府或国会会在这个问题上采取任何新的重要措施。
    同时，美国所得到的消息指出：西欧各国政府的金融与工业界人士现在正在草拟他们自己的“根本解决”美元赤字问题的计划，美国新任总统进入白宫以后，他就得解决欧洲盟国的问题。消息还指出：这些欧洲“贵”客至少要要求美国减低关税，简化关税制度，缔结稳定最重要的原料价格的协定。如果美国政府拒绝答应这些要求，那么，一些西欧国家将威吓美国说，它们要被迫与社会主义阵营国家建立“不许别国加入的贸易范围”或是扩大贸易。
    据美国报纸消息说：明年三月，在英联邦总理会议作出决议以后，邱吉尔将访问华盛顿。在离开英国以前，他将和法国与意大利的总理会谈并且代表“整个”西欧向美国新总统提出一项解决美元问题的计划。
    英美两国间日益严重的政治和经济分歧，已使人怀疑它们是否能订立重要的贸易与金融协定。
    鉴于这些矛盾和分歧，甚至像伦敦金融区机关刊
    “经济学家”这样的刊物都说：消除美元赤字的重要性并不小于生产原子弹，假如各国间在贸易上互相杀害，那么，在政治和军事上也就不可能成为盟国。
