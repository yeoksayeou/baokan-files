    Korean Newspapers Publish Commentaries
    Denouncing the U.S. for Interrupting Armistice Negotiations
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 22nd: Korean newspapers continue to publish commentaries denouncing the U.S. for interrupting the Korean armistice negotiations. The newspapers carried a dispatch from a reporter of the Korean Central News Agency from Panmunjom, which pointed out that the U.S. chief representative Harrison, acting on direct instructions from Tokyo and Washington, indefinitely interrupted the negotiations, causing unanimous protest and anger from peace-loving people all over the world who hope for a Korean armistice.
    The dispatch pointed out that the U.S. refusal of our proposal fully demonstrates the U.S. hope to prolong and expand the Korean War. This is also the reason why the U.S. secretly refused to announce the three proposals in the letter from General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, on October 16. The letter from General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai once again stated our position and pointed out that as long as the U.S. is willing to resume negotiations, we are ready to attend at any time. Thus, the U.S. only has two choices—resume negotiations or bear the responsibility for destroying the negotiations.
    The editorial of the "Democratic Korea" newspaper on the 19th pointed out: The U.S. indefinite interruption of the armistice negotiations aims at creating a situation to force the United Nations General Assembly to support its heinous conspiracy to trample on international conventions, disrupt armistice negotiations, and expand the war of aggression against Korea. But peace-loving people all over the world must never allow the aggressors' evil plan to succeed. The editorial pointed out that the Korean-Chinese side has made continuous efforts to achieve a Korean armistice. If the U.S. has the slightest sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue, it must accept the reasonable demands put forward in the letter from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to Clark and quickly return to Panmunjom.

    朝鲜报纸发表评论
    斥美方中断停战谈判
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】朝鲜报纸继续发表评论，斥责美方中断朝鲜停战谈判。各报刊载了朝鲜中央通讯社记者自板门店发来的消息，这条消息指出：美方首席代表哈利逊奉了东京和华盛顿的直接训令，无限期地中断谈判，引起了希望朝鲜停战的全世界爱好和平人民的一致抗议和愤怒。
    消息指出：美方拒绝我方建议，完全表明美方希望拖延和扩大朝鲜战争。这也就是美方秘不宣布朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军十月十六日致联合国军总司令克拉克将军的函件中三项建议的原因。金日成将军和彭德怀将军的函件，再度表明了我方的立场，并指出只要美方愿意恢复谈判，我方随时可以出席。这样美方就只有两种抉择——恢复谈判，或者担负他们破坏谈判的责任。
    十九日“民主朝鲜”报的社论指出：美方无限期中断停战谈判的目的，在于造成局面，来迫使联合国大会支持它蹂躏国际公约、破坏停战谈判以扩大侵朝战争的凶恶阴谋。但是全世界爱好和平的人民绝不能容许侵略者的罪恶计划得逞。社论指出：朝中方面为使朝鲜停战得以实现，作了不断的努力，如果美方对和平解决朝鲜问题尚有丝毫诚意，那就必须接受金日成、彭德怀将军给克拉克的信中所提出的合理要求，迅速回到板门店来。
