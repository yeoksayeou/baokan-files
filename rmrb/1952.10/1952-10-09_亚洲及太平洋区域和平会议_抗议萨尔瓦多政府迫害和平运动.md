Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
Protests El Salvador Government's Persecution of Peace Movement
(Xinhua News Agency, 8th) The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference passed the following telegram on October 8th, protesting the El Salvador government's arrest of peace activists: To Mr. Osorio, President of the Republic of El Salvador, San Salvador:

	We have learned that your government, under the pretext that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing has made decisions threatening the independence of El Salvador, has been wantonly arresting peace activists and progressive leaders throughout El Salvador since September 26th. This conference only opened on October 2nd and aims to exchange views on peace issues of common concern to the 1.6 billion people in this region. Your government has deliberately fabricated rumors and slandered this conference, and taken the opportunity to brutally persecute the El Salvador peace movement. All representatives of this conference cannot but express great indignation and strongly protest against your government's suppression of individual freedom and opposition to peace.

    抗议萨尔瓦多政府迫害和平运动
    【新华社八日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议八日会议通过抗议萨尔瓦多政府逮捕和平人士的电文如下：圣萨尔瓦多萨尔瓦多共和国总统欧索里奥先生：
    我们获悉，贵国政府藉口在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议已作出威胁萨尔瓦多独立的决定，从九月二十六日起在萨尔瓦多全国各地大肆逮捕和平人士和进步领袖。而本会议乃系十月二日才开幕，旨在就本区域十六亿人民共同关切的和平问题交换意见，而贵国政府竟不惜对本会议蓄意造谣污蔑，并乘机横暴迫害萨尔瓦多和平运动，本会议全体代表对于贵国政府此种镇压个人自由并反对和平的行为，不能不表示极大的愤慨，并提出强烈的抗议。
