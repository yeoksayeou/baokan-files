Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 30th: On October 26th, the U.S. side once again massacred a large number of our captured personnel at the Geoji Island prisoner-of-war camp, resulting in 76 deaths and injuries. General Nan Ri, Chief Representative of our delegation to the Korean armistice talks, lodged a serious protest with the other side regarding this barbaric and bloody war crime by the U.S. side. General Nan Ri pointed out: The U.S. side, on the one hand, unreasonably suspended the armistice talks, and on the other hand, continued to cold-bloodedly massacre prisoners of war. This not only proves the bankruptcy of all the U.S. side's excuses for detaining prisoners of war, but also indicates the U.S. side's determination to undermine the foundation of the Korean armistice talks. The U.S. side absolutely cannot escape the historical responsibility for massacring and detaining prisoners of war, sabotaging the armistice talks, and plotting to expand the Korean War.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 30th: On October 27th, an incident of persecution against our captured personnel occurred again at the U.S. side's Yeongcheon prisoner-of-war camp, injuring five of our captured personnel. General Nan Ri, Chief Representative of our delegation to the Korean armistice talks, protested this to the other side, pointing out that the U.S. side must bear full responsibility for this continuous war crime of persecuting prisoners of war.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 30th: The U.S. side's war crimes of massacring prisoners of war are increasing. According to the U.S. military prisoner-of-war camp authorities, the U.S. side killed and wounded 76 of our captured personnel on Geoji Island on October 26th; on October 27th, five of our captured personnel were injured at the Yeongcheon prisoner-of-war camp.

    In the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, Acheson hypocritically claimed that the U.S. side was unwilling to use force to repatriate prisoners of war, but in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, the U.S. side continued to use massacres to deprive prisoners of war of their right to repatriation, constantly using violence to force them to give up this right.

    Since October, according to U.S. news reports alone, 306 of our prisoners of war have been killed and injured, an average of more than ten people per day. On October 1st, Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, who were promoted by the U.S. side as "cooperative anti-communists," were killed and injured 165 because they sang to commemorate their country's National Day. Subsequently, because the U.S. side arrested a large number of people in various prisoner-of-war camps to gather cannon fodder, prisoners of war who rose up in protest were injured 58. In addition, two prisoners of war were persecuted to death and were routinely misrepresented by the U.S. side as having "committed suicide by hanging."

    The endless stream of massacres has made it difficult for the U.S. side to fabricate and conceal its reasons. The bloodbath on Geoji Island on the 26th was said to have occurred because the prisoners of war were "exercising," and two rows of American troops rushed up to "restore order." Even if the prisoners of war were really "exercising," Article 38 of the Geneva Convention clearly stipulates: "Prisoners of war shall have opportunities for physical exercise, including sports, games, and outdoor stays." According to the American aggressors, prisoners of war "exercising" meant there was no order, and two rows of soldiers rushing up to kill and injure 76 unarmed prisoners of war "restored order." At the same time, in the communiqué issued by the U.S. side, on the one hand, it claimed that the prisoners of war only suffered minor injuries, and on the other hand, it had to admit that "thirteen were seriously injured and needed to be hospitalized."

    The prisoners of war in the Yeongcheon prisoner-of-war camp were also described by the U.S. side as "preferring death to repatriation." On October 27th, the U.S. side injured five of them, but instead said it was "prisoners fighting each other." The facts have long proven that this is an old lie consistently used by the U.S. side to cover up their persecution of prisoners of war who oppose forced detention.

    The bloody facts of the U.S. side's massacre of our prisoners of war on Geoji Island and in Yeongcheon expose Acheson and his ilk, who talk glibly about "humanitarian principles" and "individual freedom" on the solemn United Nations platform, as man-eating wolves in sheep's clothing. At the same time, it further proves that Acheson's so-called "several thousand prisoners saying they do not want to return to communist areas unless they are forcibly repatriated" is a complete and utter lie.

### 美方又大批屠杀我方被俘人员  南日将军严重抗议美方的血腥罪行

    美方又大批屠杀我方被俘人员
    南日将军严重抗议美方的血腥罪行
    【新华社开城三十日电】十月二十六日，美方在巨济岛战俘营又一次大批屠杀我方被俘人员，死伤七十六人。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军就美方这次野蛮血腥的战争罪行，向对方提出严重抗议。南日将军指出：美方一面无理中止停战谈判，一面继续冷血地屠杀战俘，不仅证明美方一切扣留战俘的藉口的破产，而且表示美方决心破坏朝鲜停战谈判的基础。美方绝不能逃脱屠杀并扣留战俘，破坏停战谈判，阴谋扩大朝鲜战争的历史责任。
    【新华社开城三十日电】十月二十七日美方永川战俘营又一次发生迫害我方被俘人员的事件，打伤我方被俘人员五人。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军对此向对方提出抗议，指出美方对于这种连续不断的迫害战俘的战争罪行必须负完全的责任。
    【新华社开城三十日电】美方屠杀战俘的战争罪行，有增无已。据美军战俘营当局宣布，美方十月二十六日又在巨济岛打死打伤我方被俘人员七十六人；十月二十七日在永川战俘营打伤我方被俘人员五名。
    在联合国大会的政治委员会上，艾奇逊伪善地宣称美方不愿意用武力来遣返战俘，但在美方战俘营中，美方却继续用屠杀来剥夺战俘遣返的权利，为了强迫他们放弃这个权利而不断施用暴力。
    十月以来，仅据美方新闻报道，我方战俘已被打死打伤三百零六人，平均每天十人以上。十月一日，被美方宣传为“合作反共”的中国人民志愿军被俘人员因为唱歌纪念他们祖国的国庆，就被杀死杀伤一百六十五人。此后，因为美方在各个战俘营中大批抓人，搜罗炮灰，愤起抗议的战俘又被打伤五十八名。另有二名战俘被迫害致死，照例被美方谎称为“上吊自杀”。
    层出不穷的屠杀事件，使美方杜撰掩饰的理由都已感到困难。二十六日巨济岛的血案，据说是因为战俘在“上操”，两排美国军队就冲上去“恢复秩序”。即使战俘真在“上操”，日内瓦公约第三十八条也明白规定：“战俘应有作健身活动之机会，包括运动、游戏及户外停留。”按美国侵略者的说法，战俘“上操”就是没有秩序，两排兵冲上去打死打伤七十六个赤手空拳的战俘就“恢复了秩序”。同时，在美方发表的公报中，一方面声称战俘仅受微伤，另一方面又不得不承认“十三名受伤甚重，需住医院。”
    永川战俘营的战俘，也是被美方称为“宁死不愿遣返的”。十月二十七日美方打伤了其中的五名战俘，反而说是“战俘互殴”。事实早已证明，这是美方一贯用来掩盖他们迫害反对强迫扣留的战俘的老谎言。
    美方在巨济岛和永川屠杀我方战俘的血淋淋的事实，揭穿了在庄严的联合国讲坛上侈谈“人道原则”、“个人自由”的艾奇逊之流，是披着羊皮的吃人豺狼。同时也进一步证明了艾奇逊所谓“好几千个俘虏说除非强迫遣返他们，他们不想回共产党地区去”，是彻头彻尾的扯谎。
