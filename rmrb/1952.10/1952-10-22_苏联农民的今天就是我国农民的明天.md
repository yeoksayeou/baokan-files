    The Soviet Peasants' Today is Our Peasants' Tomorrow
    Editor: Our entire cooperative, seventy-four members in total, studied and discussed the articles in the newspaper about the Chinese peasant delegation's impressions of their visit to the Soviet Union three times. We further recognized the benefits of agricultural collectivization. We especially realized that after agricultural collectivization, the use of machines greatly reduced human labor, while the harvest greatly increased. For example, the Soviet Stalin No. 80 tractor, equipped with two five-bottom plows, could plow 450 mu of land in a day with only two or three people, and the plowing was deep. Our cooperative has nearly 500 mu of land, and to universally deep plow it, we would need 120 laborers. The vice-chairman, Lian Huaide, said, "This April, the yam seedlings planted in the cooperative suffered from insect pests, and we had to mobilize women to catch them one by one by hand. In the Soviet Union, we could just use airplanes to spread pesticide powder. Recently, we have had a drought here, but in the Soviet Union, they could use artificial rainmakers to irrigate." The chairman, Lian Quanbao, specifically calculated that the heavy fieldwork in Soviet collective farms can be done by machines, and on average, one laborer can be equivalent to ten to twenty of ours. In this way, only a few people are needed to manage our cooperative's nearly 500 mu of land, and the vast majority of people can go into other production, which will increase the wealth of the country by a great amount!
    In short, we all feel that: The Soviet peasants' today is our peasants' tomorrow. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the Soviet big brother, we will certainly be able to embark on the road of collectivization.

    苏联农民的今天就是我国农民的明天
    编辑同志：我们全社七十四个社员把报上登的中国农民代表参观团回国谈访苏观感的文章，学习和讨论了三次，大家进一步认识了农业集体化的好处。我们特别认识到农业集体化后，使用机器，人的劳动大大减少，而收获却大大增加了。比如苏联斯大林八十号的拖拉机，带上两个五铧犁，两三个人一天能犁四百五十亩地，而且犁的又深；我们社有近五百亩土地，要普遍深耕，就得用一百二十个人工。副社长连怀德说：“今年四月里，社里种的山药苗闹虫害，要发动妇女用手一个个去捉；在苏联，只要用飞机撒撒药粉就行啦。近几天咱们这里天旱，在苏联，就能用人工造雨器来灌溉。”社长连全保特地计算了一下：苏联集体农庄的田间重活都能用机器耕作，平均一个劳动力能抵上我们十个到二十个，这样，我们社近五百亩地，只要有少数人管理就行了，剩下绝大部分人可去搞别的生产，这会给国家增加多少财富啊！
    总之，我们都觉得：苏联农民的今天就是我国农民的明天。我们在共产党、毛主席领导下，有苏联老大哥的帮助，一定也能走上集体化的道路。
