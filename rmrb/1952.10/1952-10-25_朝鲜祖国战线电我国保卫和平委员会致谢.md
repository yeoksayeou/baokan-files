    During the most difficult period of the Korean people's war against American armed aggression, the Chinese People's Volunteers, sent by the fraternal Chinese people, in close coordination with the Korean People's Army, inflicted heavy blows on the heinous enemy with unparalleled bravery and tenacity, making tremendous contributions to defending Korea's independence and freedom and to the cause of peace and security in Asia and the world.

    The great Chinese people's surging movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, defend our homes and defend our country, which is widely launched against the American aggressors, is a huge material and spiritual help to the Korean people, further consolidating our confidence in final victory.

    The Korean people are further consolidating their fighting solidarity with the Chinese people, full of determination to thoroughly defeat the aggressors.

    We are confident that our common struggle, which is receiving the warm support and solidarity of peace-loving people all over the world, led by the great Soviet Union, will surely achieve final victory.

    Long live the fraternal friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China, forged in blood!

    Central Committee of the Fatherland United Democratic Front of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
