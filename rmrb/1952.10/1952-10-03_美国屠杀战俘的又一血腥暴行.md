    Another Bloody Atrocity of U.S. Massacre of Prisoners of War

    On October 1st, when the people of our country were joyously celebrating National Day, the brutal and inhumane U.S. aggressors carried out a bloody massacre in the prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island against captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who were also enthusiastically celebrating our National Day. According to a dispatch from Jeju Island by the Associated Press, in this bloody incident, as many as one hundred and sixty-five captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers were killed and wounded. This is the most serious crime in the U.S.'s long list of crimes of massacring prisoners of war.

    The captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers were massacred simply because, even as prisoners, they demonstrated their love and longing for their motherland by celebrating their own country's National Day. This noble patriotic sentiment should be respected by all civilized human beings, and it is also a personal right protected by all international conventions and the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention. However, the U.S. aggressors, who claim to uphold "civilization" and abide by the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention, declared the prisoners' patriotic actions to be "demonstrations" and "riots," and shot and stabbed them to death with machine guns, rifles, and bayonets, creating an unprecedented tragedy of bloodshed. And the spokesman for the U.S. military prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island even described this bloody massacre as: "This was a real battle" (Associated Press dispatch, 2nd). How cruel and inhumane this is.

    People know that the U.S. aggressors have used "prisoners singing," "prisoners fighting each other," and "prisoners hanging the national flag" as excuses to massacre prisoners of war on a large scale. Now they are even massacring prisoners for holding National Day rallies. This bloody incident once again declares that the U.S. aggressors are the public enemy of human civilization and all moral standards; they have completely torn up the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention.

    Most of the prisoners of war on Jeju Island are captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who were shamelessly fabricated by the U.S. aggressors as "preferring death to returning home." However, in just the last ten days, the U.S. aggressors have continuously created four incidents of abuse and killing of our captured personnel in the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camp alone. On September 23, the U.S. aggressors wounded 49 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers on Jeju Island; on September 25, they wounded another nine people; on September 26, they wounded four people; and on October 1, they killed and wounded as many as 165 people. Regarding the previous incidents of abuse and killing on Jeju Island, the U.S. aggressors have consistently dared not announce the details, only saying that the prisoners were wounded because they held "demonstrations," but the nature of the "demonstrations" was not mentioned at all. Now, the U.S. aggressors can no longer cover up the nature of their criminal acts. The October 1st incident fully proves that the repeated abuse and killing of captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers on Jeju Island is precisely because they love their motherland and have carried out resolute and unremitting struggles to fight for the right to return to their motherland. The U.S. aggressors' outrageous lie that captured personnel of ours "would rather die than return home" has once again been thoroughly exposed.

    From this, people can see that the U.S. aggressors' means of treating prisoners of war are: forcibly detaining them, and creating the so-called "voluntary repatriation" fraud for this purpose; but when the prisoners rise up to resolutely demand the right to return to their motherland, the U.S. aggressors, who chant "respect for the individual rights of prisoners of war" and attempt to forcibly detain prisoners of war, do not hesitate to carry out large-scale massacres. Since February of this year, more than 2,000 of our captured personnel have been killed or wounded as a result. This fraud of "voluntary repatriation" by the U.S. aggressors, stained with the blood of our captured personnel, is the only obstacle to the realization of the Korean armistice to this day. However, under these circumstances, the U.S. negotiator Harrison still said stubbornly in his so-called three "new proposals" for resolving the prisoner-of-war issue on September 28: "One of our non-negotiable demands is non-forcible repatriation." This means that the U.S.'s so-called "new proposal" is nothing more than a plan to insist on forcibly detaining and continuing to massacre our captured personnel; this also means that the U.S. aggressors are still unwilling to realize the Korean armistice and want to drive the soldiers of the United States and its vassal states to continue to make unnecessary sacrifices in order to realize that bloody fraud of "voluntary repatriation."

    The peace-loving people of all countries in the world will once again recognize from the Jeju Island bloodshed the fact that the U.S. aggressors do not want peace; they want to plunder the world with bloody atrocities and destroy human civilization and security. However, the peace-loving people of our country and all countries in the world must never tolerate this atrocity; the blood debt owed by the aggressors must be repaid. The people of all countries must further unite to stop the barbaric atrocities of the U.S. aggressors in order to defend and consolidate world peace and human security.

### 美国屠杀战俘的又一血腥暴行

    美国屠杀战俘的又一血腥暴行
    十月一日，当我国人民欢庆国庆节的时候，残暴不仁的美国侵略者在济州岛战俘营中却对同样热烈地庆祝我国国庆而集会的我志愿军被俘人员进行了一次血腥的大屠杀。据美联社自济州岛发出的消息透露，在这次血腥事件中，我志愿军被俘人员被打死打伤的达一百六十五人。这是美国屠杀战俘的累累罪行中又一次最严重的罪行。
    我志愿军被俘人员之遭受屠杀，只是因为他们虽在被俘中，却以庆祝自己祖国国庆的行动，表现了他们对祖国的热爱和向往。这种崇高的爱国感情应该受到一切文明人类的尊敬，并且也是一切国际惯例和日内瓦战俘公约所保护的个人权利。但是口口声声说是维护“文明”和遵守日内瓦战俘公约的美国侵略者，却把战俘们的爱国行动宣布为“示威”和“骚动”，并以机关枪步枪和刺刀射击和刺死他们，造成了空前的流血惨剧。而济州岛美军战俘营的发言人居然把这一血腥屠杀事件形容为：“这是一场真正的战斗”（美联社二日电）。这是何等的惨酷和没有人性。
    人们知道，美国侵略者曾以“战俘唱歌”、“战俘互殴”、“战俘悬挂国旗”为藉口，大规模地屠杀战俘，现在竟因战俘举行国庆集会而加以屠杀。这一次的血腥事件，又完全宣布了美国侵略者是人类文明和一切道德标准的公敌；他们已彻底撕毁了日内瓦战俘公约。
    济州岛上的战俘多半是被美国侵略者无耻捏造为“宁死也不愿回国”的我志愿军被俘人员。然而就在最近十天内，美国侵略者仅在济州岛战俘营中即已连续制造了四次对我被俘人员的虐杀事件。九月二十三日，美国侵略者在济州岛打伤了我志愿军被俘人员四十九人；九月二十五日又打伤了九人；九月二十六日打伤了四人；十月一日打死打伤达一百六十五人。对于济州岛上前几次的虐杀事件，美国侵略者始终不敢公布其详细情况，只是说因为战俘们举行“示威”而被打伤，至于“示威”的性质则一字不提。如今，美国侵略者再也掩盖不住他们的罪恶行为的性质了。十月一日的事件充分证明了济州岛我志愿军被俘人员之屡次被虐杀，正是因为他们热爱祖国并为争取重返祖国的权利而进行了坚决不懈的斗争。美国侵略者所制造的我被俘人员“宁死也不愿回国”的漫天大谎又一次被彻底揭穿了。
    人们由此可以看到：美国侵略者对待战俘的手段是：强迫扣留他们，并为此制造了所谓“自愿遣返”的骗局；但是当战俘们起来坚决要求重返祖国的权利时，高唱“尊重战俘个人权利”而企图强迫扣留战俘的美国侵略者便不惜实行大规模的屠杀。自今年二月以来，因此而被打死打伤的我方被俘人员已达二千人以上。这个染满着我被俘人员斑斑血迹的美国侵略者的“自愿遣返”的骗局，是朝鲜停战至今还不能实现的唯一障碍。然而在这种情况下，美国谈判代表哈利逊在他于九月二十八日提出的所谓解决战俘问题的三种“新方案”时，还依然蛮横地说：“我方的不能让步的要求之一是不强迫遣返”。这就是说，美国的所谓“新方案”不过是坚持其强迫扣留并继续屠杀我被俘人员的方案；这也就是说，美国侵略者至今还不愿意实现朝鲜停战，还要驱使美国及其附庸国家的士兵为实现那个“自愿遣返”的血腥骗局而继续作无谓的牺牲。
    世界各国爱好和平的人民，从济州岛的流血事件中，将再一次认清这样一个事实：美国侵略者是不要和平的；他们要以血腥暴行洗劫世界，摧毁人类的文明与安全。可是，爱好和平的我国人民和世界各国人民都决不能容忍这种暴行；侵略者所欠下的血债必须偿还。各国人民必须进一步团结起来制止美国侵略者的野蛮暴行，以保卫和巩固世界的和平与人类的安全。
