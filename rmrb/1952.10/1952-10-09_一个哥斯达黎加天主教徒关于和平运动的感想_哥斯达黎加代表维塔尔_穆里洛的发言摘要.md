The Costa Rican delegation has been participating in this conference for quite some time, and as a result, we have been able to gain a more thorough understanding of the true nature of the great Chinese people. We have witnessed the humility of the Chinese people, their sacred sense of responsibility, and their profound sincerity. We have also seen how they are filled with a great spirit of progress and a sincere desire for peace.

India's suggestion to choose New China as the location for this conference was, in our opinion, a truly brilliant suggestion, because in addition to possessing the great virtues mentioned above, China is also geographically at the center of those countries most affected by war. Therefore, it is bound to be one of the countries that most urgently desires world peace. Furthermore, the noble moral qualities of the great Chinese people, which we have all fully recognized, guarantee that such an important conference as this, which is now being held, has the atmosphere of honesty and sincerity that it needs. The purpose of this conference is to bring about a social change in all mankind, a change that will turn the tears of mothers, lovers, and children into happy smiles and joyful songs.

Our delegation is composed of very different elements. Our professions are different, and our political views and religious beliefs are not the same, but with a religious piety, we jointly yearn for peace to shine on the earth, and we regard this ardent wish as a sacred responsibility.

The peoples of the Americas inherited their precious religious heritage—a sacred heritage—from Spain. Anyone with reason, no matter how proud, cannot deny the great appeal of the doctrines it proclaims at all times and in all places, that love and peace are above all else. It would be a shameful thing to try to sully the sacred Lord's vestments with the dirty hands of Jesus's worst disciples.

Jesus preached peace, and therefore the entire Americas, which has accepted his teachings, loves peace the most. The good Catholics who make up the majority of us in that distant land love peace; we are all working in different ways to realize this great ideal of humanity.

But this dream in demand, this precious reason, clashed with the various policies of the imperialist governments. When they realized that they could not maintain that absurd sophistry—that peace is hateful and harmful to mankind—they fabricated the claim that the peace movement was "run by the Communists."

I don't know, and I don't want to know, who initiated this peace declaration; it is enough for me to know that it is a call of history, a call that has given us a very good and much-needed task for humanity. I don't have to investigate its source; I will support it immediately, just as I would answer "I'm in!" if I were asked to participate in any cultural work, a social movement, or anything else that benefits the people.

I am a faithful believer in the St. Thomas's saying, "Seeing is believing," and I am coming to this conference for many reasons, one of which is: I want to not confirm it, but refute it, regarding the dubious claims in our country about the source of this developing peace movement. I am very pleased to see the way this conference is being conducted—without partisan struggles and without sectarianism, avoiding all left- or right-leaning tendencies; its wise eyes are focused on the bloodstained battlefields full of hatred, pain, sorrow, and death; its soul's hope is solely placed on peace full of freedom, love, and happiness.

I am a Catholic, not a Communist; although old and ignorant, my mind has not been controlled by religious fanaticism. I can still understand: to say that the teachings that seek happiness for workers and peasants and work for peace are Communist clamor is a completely deliberately fabricated ghost story, the purpose of which is to prevent the arrival of that great dawn of humanity that is already very close—peace.

Peace does not only mean the end of hostilities, slaughter, and war. It also means the end of persecution and imprisonment; it means the end of hunger, disease, and suffering. Peace is complete tranquility; peace is almost equal to happiness. But when there are still unreasonable treaties, predatory conventions, hateful dictatorships, and governments that undermine individual rights and abolish the inherent rights of mankind in the world, these governments turn God's gift—freedom—which in fact belongs equally to all, into the reward and privilege of the powerful, peace will never come to earth in such a world.

When we talk about imperialist warmongers, we should not invoke the words of the Savior on his deathbed:

"Father, forgive them! For they know not what they do." Because those great powers that oppress mankind should bear the main responsibility for the world's descent into massacre, they occupy a leading position in the fields of science and culture, and they are very clear about what they are doing in engaging in slaughter and mutilation. But there will surely come a day—please God let it come soon!—on that day, there will be a transformation in those countries, and then, a new era for mankind—the era of peace—will begin and will last for centuries to come.

Today, together with the noble, hospitable, sincere, and deeply peace-loving Chinese people, we shout: Long live peace! (Xinhua News Agency)

    一个哥斯达黎加天主教徒关于和平运动的感想
    ——哥斯达黎加代表维塔尔·穆里洛的发言摘要
    哥斯达黎加代表团参加这次会议时间已经很长了，因此我们能够更仔细地认识了伟大的中国人民的真面目。我们已经看到了中国人民的谦逊，看到了他们神圣的责任感和深切的诚恳。我们也看到了他们如何充满了伟大的进步精神以及对于和平的真诚渴望。
    印度建议选择新中国为召开这次会议的地点，我们觉得这是一个真正天才的建议，因为中国除了具备以上这些伟大的美德之外，在地理上它还是那些最受战争影响的国家的中心。因此，它必然是那些最迫切渴望世界和平的国家中的一个。此外，我们大家已充分认识到的伟大的中国人民崇高的道德品质，保证了现在正在举行的这样一个重要的会议具备它所需要的老实和诚恳的气氛。这次会议的召开是为了在全人类中造成社会的改变，这种改变将使母亲们、爱人们和孩子们的眼泪变成幸福的微笑与欢乐的歌唱。
    我国代表团是由一些非常不同的分子组成的。我们的职业不同，我们的政治见解和宗教信仰也不一致，但是我们却以一种宗教的虔诚，共同渴望和平在大地上普照着，并把这种热切的愿望作为一个神圣的责任。
    美洲各国的人民从西班牙那里继承了他们的宝贵的宗教遗产——一份神圣的遗产。凡是有理性的人，不管他如何骄傲，都不能否认它所无时无地不在宣扬着的教义的伟大吸引力，这个教义就是爱与和平高于一切。假如想用耶稣的最坏的门徒的肮脏的手沾污神圣的主的衣钵，那是非常可耻的事情。
    耶稣宣扬和平，因此接受了他的教训的整个美洲最热爱和平。我们在那遥远的土地上占大多数的善良的天主教徒都热爱和平；我们全体正在以不同的方式为了实现这个人类伟大的理想而工作着。
    可是这个在渴求中的梦，这个宝贵的理由和帝国主义政府的种种政策起了冲突。他们在发觉不能维持那个荒谬的诡辩——和平是可恨的、对人类有害的东西的时候，就捏造了和平运动是“共产党搞的”的说法。
    我不知道，也不想知道究竟是谁发起这个和平宣言，知道它是历史的号召，这个号召交给了我们一个很好的、人类十分迫切需要的任务，对于我就够了。我不必追究它的来源，我立刻就支持它，正好像任何一桩文化工作，一个社会运动或者其他任何造福人群的事要我参加，我就会回答“有我一份！”一样。
    我是一个圣汤玛斯的箴言“眼见为信”的忠实信徒，我要来参加这次会议，有许多理由，其中一个就是：我要对于我们国内关于这个正在发展的和平运动来源可疑的说法，不是证实它，而是驳斥它。我十分高兴地看到这次会议的进行方式——既没有各种党派的斗争，也没有宗派主义，它避免一切偏左或偏右的倾向；它的慧眼注视着充满仇恨、痛苦、悲伤和死亡的血迹斑斑的战场；它的灵魂的希望一意寄托在充满了自由、热爱和幸福的和平之上。
    我是一个天主教徒，不是一个共产党员；虽然年迈无知，但是我的头脑并没有被宗教狂热所控制。我仍旧可以了解：把为工人和农民谋取幸福与为和平而工作的学说说成是共产党的叫嚣，那完全是有意编造出来的鬼话，目的是要阻止那已经很逼近的人类伟大的黎明——和平的到来。
    和平并不仅仅意味着敌对行为、屠杀和战争的结束。它也意味着迫害和监禁的结束；它意味着饥饿、疾病和苦难的结束。和平是完全的安宁；和平差不多就等于幸福。但是当世界上还存在着不讲道理的条约、掠夺性的公约、可恨的独裁政体和破坏个人权利和废除人类天生权利的政府，这些政府把事实上平等地属于所有的人的上帝的恩赐——自由，变为权贵的赏物和特权，在这样的世界里，和平是决不会降临人间的。
    当我们讲到帝国主义战争贩子的时候，我们不应当援引救世主在临死时所说的话：
    “天父啊，饶恕他们吧！因为他们是无心的。”因为那些压迫人类的大国，对世界陷入大屠杀中应负主要的责任，它们在科学和文化的领域中占有领导地位，并且非常清楚它们从事屠杀与残害用心何在。但是一定会有那么一天——请上帝让它早点到来吧！在那一天，那些国家里都将有一个转变，那时，一个为人类的新时代——和平的时代将要开端，并将在未来的世纪中长久坚持下去。
    今天，和崇高的、好客的、真诚而深切地爱好和平的中国人民在一起，我们高呼：和平万岁！               （新华社）
