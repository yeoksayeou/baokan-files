Comrades, esteemed delegates:

The representatives of the Soviet Peace Committee, with great excitement, extend our heartfelt friendly greetings to the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions on behalf of the two hundred million Soviet people, and wish them victory in their struggle for peace and national independence.

We are gathered in the capital of great, free China to discuss extremely important issues and to express the unyielding will of our peoples to strive for peace. This conference, representing the majority of mankind, gives expression to a will of immeasurable significance.

First of all, on behalf of the delegation of the Soviet Peace Committee, I would like to express our deep gratitude to our Chinese friends, our hosts, for their remarkably effective initiation and convening of this historically significant conference, for their outstanding execution of extremely complex organizational work, and for their gracious hospitality.

There was a time when the fate of the world was decided in certain distant places, and the countries of the East were in a state of tranquil paralysis, as it pleased the colonizers to say, and as many empty-headed European writers glorified at the behest of the colonizers. That era is gone forever. The peoples of the oppressed and dependent countries have risen up and are fighting for freedom and independence.

In the vast Asian part of the Soviet Union, a new socialist life is flourishing. China has become a country of free people. Great changes have taken place and are taking place in many other countries in the Asian and Pacific regions.

All of this makes people especially feel that the "Far East" is increasingly less of a distant East, just as the "Pacific Ocean" is increasingly less of a "pacific" ocean. Because in the Pacific region, due to the rampage of oppressors and instigators of new wars, a storm-like tide of popular anger has been stirred up. But, know that this ancient and renowned ocean has a more fitting name for it, namely the Great Ocean.

All the events taking place here attract the attention of all mankind. The tragedy of fighting Korea, the struggle of liberated Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia against American and French aggressors, and the resistance of Malayan patriotic fighters, all deeply move every honest person in the world.

It is precisely because the people of Asia have awakened that the enemies of peace, that is, the enemies of mankind, have adopted particularly insane and barbaric methods in Asia. Wars are being waged in Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya. Through these wars, the United States and other aggressors are trying to re-enslave the liberated people. The American army attacks with gasoline bombs and bacteriological weapons, with a cruelty that has surpassed the Hitlerite bandits.

The fighting people of Korea and other countries in the Asian and Pacific regions are waging a heroic resistance against the imperialist aggressors in order to defend their national independence. As Professor Guo Moruo rightly pointed out in his profound report, the struggle to defend peace is inseparable from the struggle for national independence and freedom. The peace movement in the countries of the Asian and Pacific regions is developing vigorously and intensively. Excellent people are uniting to resist the enemies, because these enemies are trying to re-enslave the liberated people, to force them to endure imperialist oppression again, and to enslave those who are still suffering imperialist oppression more cruelly and brutally.

All progressive humanity attaches great importance to everything that is happening in the Asian and Pacific regions. The contribution that the peoples of the countries represented at our conference have made to the common cause of peace is of truly great significance. During the days of the conference, we have personally heard how strong the will to strive for peace is in the speeches of the delegates.

The will of the peoples to strive for peace is manifested in their deep sympathy and support for the people of Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, who are fighting to defend their national survival, the right to self-determination, national independence, and autonomy.

The people of all countries unanimously and resolutely demand that the enemies of mankind stop their attempts to spread the flames of war, which are close to us, to the whole world.

The people of all countries demand the extensive development of their economic ties and cultural exchanges with each other, and resolutely eliminate all obstacles in this regard. No country should be subjected to any discrimination or restrictions in its trade with other countries.

The people of the Asian and Pacific regions severely condemn the unilateral military treaty concluded with Japan and believe that their most important obligation is to actively oppose the re-militarization of Japan and to oppose turning Japan into a base for launching new wars of aggression.

The people of all countries demand that all foreign troops withdraw from Japanese territory, that a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan be concluded, and that the independence and peaceful democratic development of Japan be guaranteed. The realization of this demand of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions is not only a solid guarantee for maintaining peace in this region but also a solid guarantee for maintaining world peace.

The attempt by American authorities to establish a Pacific bloc to attack peace-loving people and countries has aroused public anger in the Asian and Pacific regions. These people and countries, both now and in the future, resolutely oppose such insidious conspiracies by the aggressors.

The people of the Asian and Pacific regions resolutely condemn the attempts by American aggressors to delay and sabotage the Korean armistice talks, resolutely condemn the continued killing of prisoners of war by American aggressors, resolutely condemn the inhumane plans of American aggressors to destroy peaceful cities and villages in Korea, and their attempts to expand the war in the Far East by violating Chinese airspace.

The people of the Asian and Pacific regions firmly advocate a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the signing of an armistice agreement based on respect for international law and international practice, and the cessation of military operations in Korea. They resolutely condemn the use of bacteriological weapons by American aggressors in Korea and China.

All these just and legitimate demands of the people of all countries have naturally become the main topics of discussion at our conference. We should consider the methods of realizing these demands with particular thoroughness.

The Soviet people fully support these vital demands of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions, which ultimately concretely express the great aspirations of every honest person, namely, peace in the Asian and Pacific regions and peace in the whole world!

The Soviet people are fighting for peace and consider it their sacred duty. The Soviet people support all initiatives of the people of all countries to prevent the threat of an ever-approaching new world war. The Soviet people actively participate in the worldwide movement to defend peace and are proud of the significant contributions they have made to this great people's movement. The Soviet people are proud of the love and trust that the people of all countries have for them. As you all know, the Soviet Union has no other bases in the Pacific and Asian countries other than the only base that is in the hearts of millions upon millions of ordinary people in these countries.

We are particularly pleased that this conference is pervaded by the friendly relations between the people of all countries and the great concern for the needs of the people of each country, an atmosphere that warms the hearts of all in this festive hall.

Soviet society is built on the friendly relations and equal status of all nationalities in our country. Our country has justly solved the most important and urgent problem, namely, the friendly relations and cooperative collaboration of all nationalities in our country for the common good. The Soviet Union is truly a constellation of free nations that allows the genius of the people to be fully developed. The friendship of all nationalities is an inexhaustible source of spiritual and material well-being for them.

The Soviet people particularly firmly and unyieldingly support the urgent demands of the people of the Asian and Pacific countries because the Soviet people have set their own extremely ambitious construction tasks.

What the Soviet people desire and what every Soviet person cares about can be proven by the draft of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan for 1951 to 1955, which is currently being widely discussed.

Undoubtedly, many of you, at least in principle, are familiar with this vision of the near future, which particularly clearly shows the characteristics of the new reality that exists and develops in the Soviet state, which should rightly be called a country of close friendship among all nationalities.

I do not intend to list many figures, although these figures themselves are extremely convincing. I will only say that by 1955, industrial production is expected to increase by about 70 percent, and in some particularly important sectors, such as the production of hydraulic turbines, it is expected to increase by 780 percent.

During these five years, the Soviet state will continue to develop the rich resources of nature and will build many large-scale hydroelectric power stations, including the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station with more than 2 million kilowatts of electricity, which, in terms of power generation, will exceed any hydroelectric power station built on Earth. A huge project aimed at harnessing the water power of a major Asian river, the Angara River, is about to begin. Until now, the water of this great river has flowed freely into the Arctic Ocean. The work of protecting and planting forests will continue and expand, forests will be planted in deserts, and trees will be planted extensively around cities and industrial centers, along rivers, canals, and reservoirs. The new forest area will cover 5 million hectares. Huge work on irrigating pastures will be carried out in the south of the Soviet Union.

The Soviet people are not satisfied with their abundant natural resources; they are also transforming nature, making it more beautiful and richer.

After the realization of these practical plans in the near future, the national income of the Soviet Union will increase by 60 percent, which under socialist conditions means that the lives of every Soviet person will undergo significant changes. Life will be happier, better, and richer.

Anyone who can observe things more carefully can see that when he gets to know this impressive development plan of the Soviet Union's near future, the essence of the Five-Year Plan is particularly clearly permeated with concern for the welfare of every ordinary person. It should also be noted that the extremely heavy work in Soviet industry and agriculture will be mechanized and automated. People will no longer have to do extremely heavy work; all this work will be done by machines.

The national education of the Soviet Union is developing on a very large scale. The capitals of the Soviet republics and many other cities and industrial centers will implement a ten-year universal compulsory education system, and in the next five years, this principle will be extended to all residents of the Soviet Union. This means that the youth of the Soviet Union at that time will not know the historical division between intellectual and physical labor. At that time, anyone, no matter what kind of work he does, no matter what department he works in, will be a highly cultured and knowledgeable person.

The fate of the younger generation in the Soviet Union is so enviable, and middle-aged and elderly people are not lagging behind either. In the Soviet Union, not only are there 1.5 million university students, but one in three people is studying. This ordinary figure shows that tens of thousands of people who are over the age of university students can study in various schools and increase their knowledge in order to grow with the rapid development of our country.

From what has been said above, is it not obvious that the Soviet people are the most resolute supporters and defenders of peace? They are busy creating a new life and are enthusiastic about this creative cause. They create realistic conditions so that everyone can develop all their talents. They love peace and cherish peace! The people of the Asian and Pacific regions can confidently rely on the Soviet people, because the Soviet people are faithful and reliable defenders of peace.

Not long ago, when the Volga-Don Canal was opened to navigation, the Chinese "People's Daily," in expressing the friendship of the Chinese people, wrote, "The Lenin Canal is the first communist construction project in the world, and its completion shows the infinite possibilities of mankind in developing productive forces and transforming nature under the socialist and communist system." This idea is very dear to every Soviet person, and therefore every Soviet person warmly welcomes every achievement of the people of other countries in transforming nature.

Here, I cannot but mention the admiration that the Soviet people have expressed when they have seen the leaping creative achievements of the liberated Chinese people and when they have seen the truly grand construction achievements of the Chinese people. We know how enthusiastically the millions of working people of People's China responded to the call of their leader Mao Zedong to "build the Huai River well," and people call the huge project that has been launched in the Huai River basin the construction project of a new life. Such a statement is very correct and very wise, because the people who are building a new life cannot but build peace.

Striving for peace is the basis of the Soviet way of life. For us, the passion for human existence lies in peaceful creation. Our Soviet newspapers, movies, novels, and poems all talk about peace. Novels and movies that call for hatred of the people of a certain country can never appear in our Soviet Union. Our literature and art are a profound and truthful reflection of the thoughts of the Soviet people, which are full of the spirit of peace and full of concern for the future.

Our country's foreign policy starts from the following unshakable principle: that the people of every country have the freedom to choose a certain way of life, a certain political system, and a certain ideological system. Any form of aggression is always resolutely condemned by our country. The inherent characteristic of every Soviet person and the entire Soviet society is great respect for the people of every country.

The Soviet Union's foreign policy, from the very beginning of its implementation, has been based on the principle of peaceful coexistence.

I believe that I have a responsibility to cite here the famous statement made by the great leader of the Soviet people, J. V. Stalin, on May 17, 1948, in which he said:

"The Soviet government believes that, despite the economic system and ideological differences, the coexistence of these systems and the peaceful resolution of Soviet-American differences are not only possible but also absolutely necessary for the benefit of universal peace."

In the famous statement made by J. V. Stalin on April 2, 1952, he again said:

"The peaceful coexistence of capitalism and communism is entirely possible if there is a desire to cooperate with each other, a willingness to fulfill the obligations undertaken, and the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed."

This is the clear position of the Soviet Union.

This conference of ours is a conference of friendship among the people of all countries. We know that there is a malicious propaganda campaign attacking this conference, which is being instigated by the reactionary forces of Wall Street, in order to oppose all the people who demand a free and independent life, to oppose the unity and friendship of these people, to oppose progress, and to oppose the most sublime aspirations of mankind. The enemies of peace and mankind are trying to use insidious provocative lies to alienate the people of all countries, thereby weakening the strength of the people of all countries. But the people of all countries are very vigilant, and they will never allow this. No force can destroy the solidarity and fraternal friendship among the people of all countries that are being forged in this hall.

I am deeply convinced that after discussing the current pressing issues, we will be able to put forward a clear and concrete program of action that will closely unite the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, sanction the insidious enemies of mankind, and stop new wars.

The Soviet delegation fully agrees with the suggestions made by Professor Guo Moruo in his report and believes that it is appropriate to use these suggestions as the basis for the resolutions and declarations we are about to pass.

The powerful voices of the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions should merge with the voices of the people of other countries in the world at the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna on December 5. This is the scale of our actions, and this is our responsibility.

As my speech is about to end, I would like to say that we Soviet people are extremely satisfied with the remarkable achievements of the peace movement in Latin American countries and Canada. We are also extremely satisfied with the fact that the American people have begun to awaken, which is proven by many materials. Although the reactionary newspapers and radio broadcasts try to overwhelm the voice of truth, the whole world knows that the American people have begun to awaken. No sane person will confuse the rampant American dark forces with the American people who are sympathized with by the Soviet people.

An American writer who was persecuted by the reactionary forces of American imperialism (I am referring to Congressional candidate Howard Fast) said:

"The question of whether the American people want peace does not exist. They ardently hope for peace, they seek peace, and they fight for peace... The only question now is how to unite the many and varied forces that crave peace and hate war in order to defend peace. All conscious and good Americans are working to achieve this goal. The American people are fully determined not to let a new war break out." The views of this American writer cannot but be agreed with.

This is the voice of true Americans and honest democrats. If one knows that there are more and more such people in the United States, then one can look more calmly at the arrogant dreams recently shouted out by the general who wants to run for president of the United States. This American general has frantically clamored as if the war has already begun or is about to break out tomorrow. But the people of the whole world, including the American people, will not allow and will never allow such arrogant remarks to become a reality. This also explains why all honest people in the world are very satisfied to see the growth of the peace movement in the country that is currently enjoying the notorious title of "the fortress of modern reactionary forces."

Esteemed delegates! What the people of the Asian and Pacific regions say is extremely weighty and is in line with the role played by the people of the countries represented at this conference. The eyes of all mankind are on our conference. We will use clear, convincing resolutions that point out the path to saving mankind to help the people of the Asian and Pacific regions undertake the cause of maintaining peace. As we are deeply aware, this is the most reliable and only guarantee that war will not break out.

Long live the unity and solidarity of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions in the struggle for peace, freedom, and national independence!

Strive for peace in the Asian and Pacific regions, strive for peace in the whole world! (Xinhua News Agency)

### 苏联代表团团长  伊·伊·阿尼西莫夫的发言

专栏：

    苏联代表团团长
    伊·伊·阿尼西莫夫的发言敬爱的各位代表：
    苏联保卫和平委员会的代表，怀着极兴奋的心情，代表两万万苏联人民谨向亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民，致以衷心友好的敬意，并祝他们在争取和平与民族独立的斗争中获得胜利。
    我们聚会在伟大自由中国的首都，为的是要讨论极其重要的问题，并表达我们各国人民争取和平的不屈不挠的意志。这个会议，代表着人类的大半数，这样表达出来的意志，是具有无限重大的意义的。
    首先我代表苏联保卫和平委员会的代表团向我们的中国朋友，也就是向我们的主人表示深切的谢忱，感谢他们卓著成效地发起召开这次具有历史意义的会议，感谢他们非常出色地进行了极为复杂的组织工作，感谢他们的殷勤招待。
    曾经有过一个时代，世界的命运决定于某些遥远的地方，而东方国家却处在为殖民者所称心，并在殖民者的授意下为欧洲许多空头文学家所歌颂过的沉静的、麻痹的状态中，这样的时代已经一去不复返了。东方国家已经不再是消极的、甘受帝国主义者宰割的国家了。各个被压迫国和依赖国的人民已经行动起来，并在争取自由与独立了。
    在苏联的广阔的亚洲部分，新的社会主义生活繁荣起来了。中国已变成了一个自由的人民的国家。亚洲及太平洋区域的其他许多国家也都发生了并发生着巨大的变化。
    所有这一切都使人们格外感到，“远东”已经越来越不是遥远的东方，正如“太平洋”已经越来越不是“太平”的海洋了。因为在太平洋区域里，由于压迫者和新战争挑拨者的逞凶，激起了人民的暴风雨般的怒潮。但是，要知道这个历史悠久而富有盛名的大洋，还有一个对它更适合的称呼，那就是伟大的海洋。
    这里所发生的一切事件，都引起了全人类的注意。战斗着的朝鲜的惨痛，解放了的越南、寮国和高棉反对美法侵略者的斗争，以及马来亚爱国志士的反抗，这一切使世界上每一个诚实的人都深为感动。
    正因为亚洲人民已经觉醒，所以和平的敌人，也就是人类的敌人，便在亚洲采取了特别疯狂的野蛮手段。在朝鲜、越南、寮国、高棉和马来亚正进行着战争。美国和其他侵略者力图借这战争而使解放了的人民重新沦为奴隶。美国军队用汽油弹和细菌武器进攻，其残酷程度是已超过希特勒匪帮了。
    朝鲜和亚洲及太平洋区域其他各国的战斗着的人民，为了捍卫本国的民族独立，对帝国主义侵略者进行着英勇的抗战。正像郭沫若教授在他的内容深刻的报告中所正确强调指出的，保卫和平的斗争是和争取民族独立与自由的斗争分不开的。亚洲及太平洋区域各国的和平运动正声势浩大地、紧张地开展着。优秀的人士都在团结起来，抗击敌人，因为这些敌人妄图使解放了的各国人民重新陷于奴役的境地，强迫他们再受帝国主义者的压迫，而对于那些一直到现在还在遭帝国主义压迫的人民则奴役得更加残忍凶暴。
    全体进步人类都极其重视亚洲及太平洋区域各国所发生的一切。我们这次会议所代表的各国人民对共同的和平事业所作的贡献，是具有真正伟大的意义的。在会议进行的这几天内，我们亲自听到，在代表们发言中，争取和平的意志是多么强烈。
    各国人民力求和平的意志表现在对朝鲜、越南、马来亚等国人民的深切同情和支持上面，这三个国家的人民正在为保卫自己的民族生存、自决权、民族独立和自主权而斗争着。
    各国人民都一致坚决要求制止人类之敌硬要把我们近旁的战火蔓延到全世界去的企图。
    各国人民要求广泛开展他们彼此间的经济联系和文化交流，坚决扫除这方面的各种障碍。任何一个国家在对他国的贸易上，不应该遭到任何歧视和任何限制。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民严斥与日本缔结的片面军事条约，并认为自己的最重要的义务，就是要积极地反对目前日本的重新军国主义化，反对把日本变为发动新侵略战争的根据地。
    各国人民要求一切外国军队撤出日本领土，缔结全面的对日和约，保证日本的独立及和平民主的发展。亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民这一要求的实现，不仅是维护这一地区的和平的牢固保证，而且是维护世界和平的牢固保证。
    美国当权人物想要建立太平洋集团来进攻各爱好和平的人民和国家，这一企图激起了亚洲和太平洋区域各国人民的公愤。这些人民和国家无论现在和将来都坚决反对侵略者的这种奸险的阴谋。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民坚决斥责美国侵略者拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的企图，坚决斥责美国侵略者继续杀害战俘的行为，坚决斥责美国侵略者毁灭朝鲜和平城市和乡村的惨无人道的计划，及其借侵犯中国领空来扩大远东战争的企图。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民坚决主张和平地解决朝鲜问题，在尊重国际法和国际惯例的基础上签订停战协定，停止在朝鲜的军事行动。他们坚决斥责美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器。
    各国人民这一切公正的合法的要求，自然就成了我们这次会议讨论的主要题目。我们应该特别周密地考虑实现这些要求的方法。
    苏联人民完全支持亚洲及太平洋区域各国民众这些切身的要求，这些要求归根到底是具体地表现出了每个诚实人的伟大心愿，这种心愿也就是亚洲及太平洋区域的和平，全世界的和平！
    苏联人民正在为和平而斗争，并认为这是自己神圣的义务。各国人民力求阻止日益迫近的新世界大战的威胁，苏联人民在这方面赞助各国人民的一切创举。苏联人民积极参加全世界的保卫和平运动并以自己在这一伟大人民运动中所作出的重大贡献而自豪。苏联人民以各国人民对他们的热爱与信任而自豪。各位都知道，苏联在太平洋与亚洲各国内蕴藏在这些国家内千千万万普通人的心灵里的这唯一的基地外，是没有别的基地的。
    特别使我们高兴的，就是在这次会议上，笼罩着各国人民间的友好关系和对每个国家人民的需要的十分关心，这种气氛温暖了这个喜庆的大厅中全体人们的心灵。
    苏维埃社会是建筑在我国各族人民的友好关系与平等地位上面。我国已经公正地解决了一个最重要、最迫切的问题，即我国各族人民的友好关系和
    为了共同的福利而协力合作的问题。苏联是真正使人民天才得以充分发扬光大的各自由民族的星座。各族人民的友谊是他们获得精神福利与物质福利的无穷无尽的泉源。
    苏联人民之所以特别坚决和不屈不挠地支持亚洲及太平洋各国人民的迫切要求，是因为苏联人民定下了自己极巨大的建设任务。
    苏联人民的愿望是什么，每个苏维埃人所关心的又是什么，这点可以拿目前正在广泛地讨论着的苏联一九五一年到一九五五年的五年计划草案加以证明。
    无疑义地，大家中间有许多人，至少在基本上认识这一最近将来的情景，从这一情景中就特别清楚地表明出了在苏维埃国家，也就是在应份称呼为各族人民亲密友谊的国家内存在并发展起来的新现实的特点。
    我不打算来列举许多的数目字，虽然这些数目字本身是极能使人信服的。我只说一说，到一九五五年，工业的生产量预定约增加百分之七十，有某些特别重要的部门，例如水力涡轮机的生产量预定增加百分之七百八十。
    苏维埃国家在这五年中，要继续开发自然界的丰富资源，将建成许多规模宏大的水电站，其中包括有超过二百万瓩电力的古比雪夫水电站，这一水电站，按照发电力来说，要超过地球上已建成的任何一个水电站。旨在利用亚洲一条大河——安加拉河的水力的巨大工程即将开始。这条大河的水，直到现在还是白白地流入北冰洋。将继续并扩大护植田林工作，把沙漠上种起森林，在城市与工业中心的周围，在河流、运河、水库的沿岸，广植树木。新的森林面积将占五百万公顷。在苏联南部将进行灌溉牧场的巨大工作。
    苏联人民并不以自己的丰富的天然资源为满足，他们还在改造自然界，使它更加美丽，更加富饶。
    在实现了最近将来的这些实际计划后，苏联的国民收入即可增加百分之六十，这在社会主义的条件下就是说，每个苏联人的生活将发生显著的变化。生活将更加幸福，更加美好，更加富裕。
    每一个能够多观察事物的人，当他来认识苏联最近将来这一引起深刻印象的发展计划时，他就可以看到，五年计划的要旨中，格外明确地贯串有对每一个普通人的福利的关怀。还应该注意到，苏联的工业和农业中极繁重的工作都将实行机械化与自动化。人们再也不必去做极沉重的工作，这种工作都将由机器来做了。
    苏联的国民教育极大规模地发展起来。苏联各加盟共和国首都，及其他许多城市和工业中心，都将执行十年制的普遍义务教育，而在下一个五年内，这一原则将普及到苏联的全体居民中。这就是说，那时的苏联青年，就不知道历来的智力劳动与体力劳动之间的分裂了。那时任何一个人，不论他从事什么样的工作，不论他在那一个部门工作，都将是一个有高度文化和有学识的人。
    苏联年青一代人的命运，既是这样令人羡慕，而中年人和老年人也不自甘落后。在苏联，不仅有一百五十万大学生，而且三个人中间，就有一个人在学习。这个平凡的数目字表示出，成千成万超过了大学年龄的人，就能在各种学校内学习，增加自己的知识，以便随同我国的急速发展而成长起来。
    从上面所讲的看来，苏联人是和平的最坚决的拥护者和保卫者，这难道还不明显吗？他们忙于创造新的生活，热中于这种创造性的事业。他们造成现实条件，使每个人都能发挥自己所有的一切才能。他们热爱和平，珍视和平！亚洲及太平洋区域的各国人民可以有把握地信赖苏联人，因为苏联人是忠实而可靠的和平保卫者。
    不久以前，因伏尔加—顿河运河的通航，中国的“人民日报”在表达中国人民的友谊时写道，“列宁运河是世界上第一个共产主义的建设工程，它的完成显示了人类在社会主义与共产主义制度下发展生产力和改造自然的无限可能性。”这一思想对每一个苏联人都十分亲切，因而每个苏联人对于其他国家人民在改造自然界中的每一种成就，都是热烈欢迎的。
    这里，我不能不讲出，苏联人民在看到解放了的中国人民的突飞猛进的创造性成绩时，在看到中国人民的真正宏大的建设成绩时所表现出来的赞美的心情。我们知道，人民中国千千万万的劳动人民该是何等热烈地响应自己的领袖毛泽东发出的“一定要把淮河修好”的号召，人们把淮河流域业已展开的巨大工程称为新生活的建设工程。这样的说法是非常正确、非常明智的，因为建设着新生活的人民是不能不建设和平的。
    努力于和平，是苏维埃生活方式的基础。对我们说来，人类生存的热情就寄存在和平的创造中。我们苏联的报纸、电影、小说和诗歌上，都谈的是和平。号召仇视某国人民的小说和电影，就决不能在我们苏联出现。我国的文学和艺术是苏联人思想之深刻的、真实的反映，其中充满了爱好和平的精神，充满了对未来的关怀。
    我国的对外政策是从以下确定不移的原则出发的：即每个国家的人民都有选择某种生活方式、某种政治制度、某种思想体系的自由。任何形式的侵略总是遭到我国坚决的斥责。每个苏联人以及整个苏维埃社会的固有特点，就是对每个国家的人民都非常尊敬。
    苏联对外政策，从最初执行的时候起，就是以和平共存的原则为基础的。
    我认为我有责任，要在这里引证苏联人民的伟大领袖约·维·斯大林一九四八年五月十七日的著名声明，他说：
    “苏联政府认为：尽管经济制度与思想上的不同，但这些制度的并存以及和平解决苏美间分歧，不仅是可能的，而且为了普遍和平的利益，还是绝对 必要的。”
    一九五二年四月二日约·维·斯大林所作的著名声明上，又说：
    “如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，并且平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那么资本主义与共产主义的和平共存就是十分可能的。”
    这就是苏联的明确的立场。
    我们这个会议是各国人民友好的会议。我们知道有一种恶毒宣传在大肆攻击这次会议，这种宣传是由华尔街反动势力煽动起来的，为的是反对一切要求自由独立生活的人民，反对这些人民的团结与友谊、反对进步、反对人类最崇高的愿望。和平与人类的敌人，妄图用阴险的挑拨的谎言，来离间各国人民，因而削弱各国人民的力量。但各国人民是很警惕的，他们永远也不会容许这样的。任何力量都破坏不了这个大厅里正在锻炼着的各国人民间的团结一致和兄弟般的友好关系。
    我深信，我们在讨论了当前的迫切问题以后，一定能提出一个明确的、具体的行动纲领，这个纲领将使亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民紧密地团结起来，制裁人类的阴险敌人和制止新的战争。
    苏联代表团完全赞成郭沫若教授在报告中所提出的建议，并认为把这些建议作为我们所要通过的各项决议和宣言的基础是很适当的。
    十二月五日将在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会上，亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的雄壮呼声，应当与世界其他各国人民的呼声融成一片。这就是我们的行动规模，这就是我们的责任。
    当我的发言快要结束的时候，我想说出，我们苏联人民极满意拉丁美洲各国和加拿大的和平运动的显著成绩。也极满意有很多材料来加以证明的美国人民已经开始觉醒的事实，尽管反动的报纸和无线电广播企图压倒真理的声音，但全世界都知道美国人民已开始觉醒起来。任何一个思想健全的人，是决不会把横行霸道的美国黑暗势力与苏联人民所同情的美国人民混为一谈的。
        一位受到美帝国主义反动势力所追究的美国作家（我指的是国会候补议员哈瓦德·法斯特），他说：
    “美国人民是否愿意和平，这个问题并不存在。他们热烈地希望和平，他们企求和平，并为和平而奋斗……现在的问题，只是在于把渴望和平和痛恶战争的极多的、各种各样的力量联合起来，以保卫和平。一切觉悟的、善良的美国人，都正在为达到这一目的而努力。美国人民完全有决心不让新战争爆发。”这位美国作家的见解，是不能不令人同意的。
    这就是真正的美国人和正直的民主主义者的呼声，若是知道这种人在美国是越来越多，那就可以比较镇静地去看待那位想当美国总统竞选人的将军在不久前所叫出的狂妄的梦话。这位美国将军曾疯狂地叫嚣：仿佛战争已经开始了，或者明天就要爆发。但是包括美国人民在内的全世界人民不会容许、也决不容许这种狂妄言论变成现实，这也就说明，为什么全世界的正直人士都很满意地注视着现实享有“现代反动势力堡垒”这一臭名的国家内和平运动增长的情形。
    敬爱的代表们！亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民所说的话是极有份量的，是与这次会议所代表的各国人民所起的作用相符合的。全人类的目光都在注视着我们的会议。我们将用明明白白的、令人信服的、能指出拯救人类的道路的种种决议，来帮助亚洲及太平洋区域人民担当起维护和平的事业。正如我们所深刻意识到的，这就是使战争不会爆发的最可靠的、唯一的保障。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民在争取和平、自由与民族独立斗争中的统一与团结万岁！
    争取亚洲及太平洋区域各国的和平，争取全世界的和平！　（新华社）
