    Consolidate the People's Democratic Dictatorship and Unite International Friends
    Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League
    Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out in his opening address at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The state system of our people's democratic dictatorship is a powerful weapon for safeguarding the achievements of the people's revolution and opposing the restoration plots of enemies at home and abroad, and we must firmly grasp this weapon. Internationally, we must unite with all countries and peoples who love peace and freedom, especially with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, so that our struggle to safeguard the achievements of the people's revolution and oppose the restoration plots of enemies at home and abroad will not be isolated. As long as we adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and unite international friends, we will be forever victorious."
    The development of the situation in the past three years is entirely in line with Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment. Because we resolutely implemented the people's democratic dictatorship and resolutely united with the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, we have achieved great victories in all aspects.
    In the past three years, our people have taken a series of serious steps to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and safeguard national security. Through the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement, the Land Reform Movement, the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, the Ideological Remolding Movement, and the Judicial Reform Movement, we have completed the reform work in all aspects of the country and greatly improved the political consciousness of the people. Our national defense forces have been further strengthened. Our revolutionary order is more consolidated. Our political system is more perfect. The unity within our united front is closer. At the same time, we have completed the restoration and transformation of the national economy, fundamentally improving our country's financial and economic situation. This enables us not only to safeguard the fruits of the revolution and frustrate the restoration plots of domestic and foreign reactionaries, but also to prepare conditions for the large-scale national construction work that is about to begin.
    These victories and achievements are inseparable from the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, inseparable from the concerted efforts of the people of the whole country, and inseparable from the powerful existence and selfless assistance of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    In the future, we must achieve greater victories on the basis of victory. On the one hand, we must comprehensively and systematically carry out large-scale economic construction and cultural construction, and strive to accelerate the country's industrialization. On the other hand, we must continue to strengthen national defense construction and unite all peace-loving forces to strive to defend peace in the Far East and the world. This is the glorious task of the Chinese people.
    A peaceful environment is one of the important conditions for our country to carry out large-scale construction. This shows why the Chinese people are truly supporters and defenders of peace. As everyone knows, up to this day, the American aggressors are still continuing to delay and undermine the Korean armistice negotiations, and carry out various military provocations, in an attempt to expand the war of aggression against Korea. At the same time, the American aggressors are still occupying our territory of Taiwan, and blatantly violate all international agreements, ignoring the opposition of the Japanese people, the Chinese people, and the peoples of Asian countries, and are stepping up the revival of Japanese militarist forces, plotting to use Japan to launch a new war of aggression. Therefore, our national security and Far Eastern peace are still under serious threat. This cannot but make us maintain a high degree of vigilance.
    However, the Chinese people have full confidence and strength to stop this threat, and have confidence and strength to carry out large-scale construction work. As long as we can resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, unite well ourselves, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, unite well with our Soviet allies, unite well with all people's democratic countries, unite well with all peace-loving nations and peoples in the world, and further organize and mobilize all peace-loving forces on the basis of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, we will surely be able to achieve new victories in building a great motherland, new victories in the anti-aggression struggle, and new victories in defending lasting peace in the Far East and the world.
    Today, as we warmly celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with joy and excitement, let each of us make a guarantee: under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, we will redouble our efforts to complete the glorious task of large-scale national construction, consolidating national defense, and defending peace.

    巩固人民民主专政，团结国际友人
    中国民主同盟主席    张澜
    毛泽东主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议上的开幕词中指出：“我们的人民民主专政的国家制度是保障人民革命的胜利成果和反对内外敌人的复辟阴谋的有力的武器，我们必须牢牢地掌握这个武器。在国际上，我们必须和一切爱好和平自由的国家和人民团结在一起，首先是和苏联及各新民主国家团结在一起，使我们的保障人民革命胜利成果和反对内外敌人复辟阴谋的斗争不致处于孤立地位。只要我们坚持人民民主专政和团结国际友人，我们就会是永远胜利的。”
    三年来形势的发展完全符合于毛主席的英明论断。由于我们坚决实行人民民主专政，坚决团结以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，我们在各方面取得了伟大的胜利。
    三年来，我国人民为了巩固人民民主专政，为了保卫国家的安全，采取了一系列的严重步骤。通过抗美援朝运动、土地改革运动、镇压反革命运动、“三反”“五反”运动、思想改造运动和司法改革运动，我们完成了国家各方面的改革工作，大大提高了人民群众的政治觉悟。我们的国防力量是更加充实了。我们的革命秩序更加巩固了。我们的政权制度更加完善了。我们统一战线内部的团结更加紧密了。与此同时，我们完成了国家经济的恢复和改造工作，使我们国家的财政经济状况得到根本好转。这样就使我们不仅能够保障革命的胜利果实，挫败内外反动派的复辟阴谋，并且为即将开始的大规模的国家建设工作准备好条件。
    这些胜利和成就，是跟毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导分不开的，是跟全国人民的戮力同心分不开的，也是跟以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的强大存在及其无私援助分不开的。
    今后我们要在胜利的基础上取得更大的胜利。一方面，我们要全面地、有计划地进行大规模的经济建设和文化建设，为加速国家的工业化而奋斗。另一方面，我们必须继续加强国防建设，并团结所有爱好和平的力量，为保卫远东以及世界的和平而奋斗。这是我国人民的光荣任务。
    和平的环境是我国进行大规模建设的重要条件之一。这说明中国人民为什么真正是和平的拥护者和保卫者。大家知道：直到今天为止，美国侵略者仍在继续拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，并进行各种军事挑衅，力图扩大侵略朝鲜的战争。与此同时，美国侵略者现在仍霸占着我国的领土台湾，并悍然违背一切国际协议，不顾日本人民、中国人民以及亚洲各国人民的反对，加紧复活日本军国主义势力，阴谋利用日本发动新的侵略战争。因此我国安全与远东和平仍受着严重的威胁。这不能不使我们保持高度的警惕。
    但是，中国人民完全有信心和力量来制止这种威胁，并有信心和力量来进行大规模的建设工作。我们只要能够坚决地遵照毛主席的指示，自己好好地团结一致，进一步巩固人民民主专政，并好好地和苏联盟友团结一致，好好地和所有人民民主国家团结一致，好好地和世界上一切爱好和平的民族和人民团结一致，在中苏友好同盟互助的基础上，进一步把所有爱好和平的力量组织起来，动员起来，我们就一定能够取得建设伟大祖国的新胜利，取得反侵略斗争的新胜利，取得保卫远东与世界持久和平的新胜利。
    今天，当我们以欢欣鼓舞的心情热烈地庆祝中华人民共和国成立三周年的时候，让我们每一个人提出保证：在中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，为完成大规模国家建设、巩固国防、保卫和平这个光荣任务而加倍努力。
