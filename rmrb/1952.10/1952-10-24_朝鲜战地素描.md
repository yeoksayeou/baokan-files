    Sketches from the Korean Battlefield
    By Liu Lun
    (1) Planting Rice on the Front Lines
  The roar of guns and cannons echoes on the other side of the mountain,
  While on this side, in rows and lines,
  Volunteer soldiers and Korean people plant rice together.
  Production supports the front lines, labor conquers disaster!
  The roar of guns and cannons echoes on the other side of the mountain,
  But on this side, we remain calm and composed,
  Planting rice, one seedling at a time.
  The seedlings are drenched in water,
  Vibrant and green,
  Bathed in the warm sunlight,
  The crops grow strong,
  Who's afraid of you, American devils!
  Who can defeat the strength of the Chinese and Korean people!

    (2) Air Defense Sentry
  A tall tree grows on the mountaintop,
  Its branches reaching towards the sky.
  The countless hills and mountains of North Korea, the major transportation arteries,
  Are filled with young air defense sentries.
  See how they listen intently, their eyes constantly searching.
  When enemy planes appear in the sky, they wave flags and blow whistles;
  When enemy planes approach, they fire warning shots.
  Look! Trucks loaded with ammunition and food, speeding past them!

    (3) The Volunteer Army's Printing Press
  Engineers blasted a long cave,
  To make the Volunteer Army's printing press.
  This cave is truly wonderful,
  Warm in winter and cool in summer, safe and secure,
  Brightly lit by electric lights.
  Dozens of male and female comrades,
  Work and sing together.
  The machines whir and click,
  Producing newspapers like waves crashing on the sea.
  Crashing waves, crashing waves,
  Revolutionary truth sent to the front,
  News of victory spreads everywhere.

    朝鲜战地素描
    刘仑　作
    （一）火线插秧枪炮在山那边轰响，山这边排成队，列成行，志愿军和朝鲜人民齐插秧。生产支援前线，劳动战胜灾荒！枪炮在山那边轰响，山这边不慌不忙，一把一把来插秧。苗儿水淋淋，绿汪汪，太阳普照，庄稼生长，谁怕你美国鬼子！谁能压倒中朝人民的力量！（二）防空哨
  大树长在山顶，
  枝干伸向天空。
  北朝鲜的千万个丘陵、山岗、交通大道，
  满布着年青的防空哨兵。你看他耳听八方，眼睛搜索不停。天空窜来了敌机，他就挥旗吹哨；敌机近了，他就鸣枪告警。看哪！满载弹药粮食的汽车，在他面前飞跑前进！（三）志愿军的印刷厂工兵炸开一个长山洞，来做志愿军的印刷厂。这个山洞真不错，冬暖夏凉又保险，电灯照得光亮亮。男女同志几十个，一边工作一边唱。机器喀嚓喀嚓响，出报如同大海翻白浪。翻白浪，翻白浪，革命真理送前方，胜利的消息到处飞扬。（附图片）
