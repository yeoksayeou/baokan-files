    The "First National Opera Performance and Observation Conference," sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, solemnly opened in Beijing on the 6th.

    Those attending the opening ceremony included Guo Moruo, Vice Premier of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government; Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture; Zhou Yang and Ding Xilin, Vice Ministers of Culture; Tian Han, Director of the Arts Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture; responsible cadres from central and major administrative regions, provinces, and municipalities' cultural administrative organs; and over 3,000 opera workers from twenty-one opera genres including Peking Opera, Ping Opera, Yue Opera, Henan Opera, Shanghai Opera, Qin腔 Opera, Shanxi Bangzi, Puzhou Bangzi, Hebei Bangzi, Quju, Jianghuai Opera, Sichuan Opera, Cantonese Opera, Guiju, Xiang Opera, Han Opera, Chu Opera, Dian Opera, Jiangxi Picking Flower Opera, Hunan Flower Drum Opera, and Mei鄠 Opera, who came to Beijing to participate in the performances.

    The opening ceremony was presided over by Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture of the Central People's Government, who also delivered the opening speech. He pointed out that the main tasks of this performance and observation were to exhibit the achievements of creation and reform in local opera arts and exchange work experience, to reward excellent plays and actors, and to take this opportunity to examine the implementation of opera reform policies in various places. At the same time, investigations and research will be conducted on the history and current situation of each opera genre, so that opera workers from various genres can observe and learn from each other, absorb experience, and improve the ideological and artistic level of opera, in order to further implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new."

    After Ma Yanxiang, Deputy Director of the Arts Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, reported on the preparations, Sha Kofu, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Culture, on behalf of the Ministry of Culture, announced the establishment of an award committee headed by Shen Yanbing, with Zhou Yang, Ding Xilin, Mei Lanfang, Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, and Sha Kofu as deputy directors, and with responsible persons from local cultural administrative organs, experts, and famous actors from various opera genres participating. This committee will be responsible for carefully and conscientiously evaluating the programs participating in this performance.

    Vice Premier Guo Moruo spoke at the meeting, encouraging opera workers and actors across the country to strengthen unity, learn humbly, and jointly complete the glorious historical task of reforming and developing Chinese national art and better serving the people and the construction of the motherland.

    Wu Han, Vice Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, addressed the meeting, extending a warm welcome on behalf of the 2.5 million people of the capital to all those participating in this performance.

    In his speech, Zhou Yang pointed out that competitive performance is a good way to promote opera art and explained that the spirit of this award is to respect heritage while encouraging legitimate innovation, and to respect collective efforts while praising outstanding individual achievements. Zhou Yang also pointed out that the correct attitude towards competition is mutual respect and humble learning among the various opera genres. He also encouraged opera workers in various places to put forward criticisms and constructive opinions on the opera reform work in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything.

    Ding Xilin spoke at the meeting, encouraging artists of various opera genres to learn well from each other, learn from each other's strengths, and make up for their weaknesses in this performance, so that each opera genre can develop better.

    In addition, Tian Han, Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Yuan Xuefen, Chang Xiangyu, Wu Tianbao, Zhang Decheng and others also spoke at the meeting. They believed that this performance and observation was an unprecedented initiative in the history of Chinese opera art, and only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party could there be such a grand gathering of opera genres from all over the country. They all expressed their boundless excitement and vowed to make this conference a success and further improve the opera reform work, so as to use the powerful opera art weapon to serve the great cause of defending the motherland and defending world peace. All the participants in the conference stood in silence to pay tribute to the Quyi (folk art) workers Chang Baokun and Cheng Shutang, who gloriously sacrificed on the front lines of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea in April last year.

    The opening ceremony was filled with an atmosphere of unity, friendship and enthusiasm. Representatives of various literary and art units in the capital presented banners to the conference, and representatives of opera workers from various regions participating in the performance solemnly presented one hundred bouquets of flowers to the conference, symbolizing the "blooming of a hundred flowers" in opera art.

    The performance program of the conference also officially began on the 6th.
