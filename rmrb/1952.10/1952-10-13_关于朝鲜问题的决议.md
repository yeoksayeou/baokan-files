Resolution on the Korean Question

The Korean War continues. The armistice negotiations, which the people of Asia and the world have longed for to reach an agreement as soon as possible, have been severely obstructed by the US representatives' rejection of the repatriation of all prisoners of war and unilateral decision to adjourn indefinitely. Large-scale bombings aimed at destroying peaceful cities and peaceful residents are being widely carried out. Poison gas bombs and napalm bombs are still being used in large quantities. Incidents of massacre and abuse of prisoners of war are becoming more frequent. The bacteriological warfare being waged in Korea poses a great threat to the people of the world, and the Chinese people have also become the target of bacteriological weapons attacks. These facts have been confirmed by the investigation of the International Scientific Committee. The Chinese territory of Taiwan is still occupied, and China's borders and territorial waters and airspace continue to be subjected to direct provocative violations. Japan's militarist forces are being intensified. These circumstances create the danger of prolonging and expanding the Korean War and exacerbate the situation in the Far East.

In view of the above dangerous situation, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference believes that for the benefit of the 1.6 billion people in this region, it is necessary to call on the people of the world to unite and demand:

	I. The US armistice negotiation representatives should immediately stop their unreasonable actions that undermine the Korean armistice negotiations, based on the principle of negotiated settlement of international disputes.
	II. The belligerent parties in Korea should repatriate all prisoners of war and immediately cease hostilities in accordance with international law and practices, in particular the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the terms of the armistice agreement that have been reached.
	III. Immediately prohibit and stop the US military from using all weapons of mass destruction, including bacteriological weapons, poison gas bombs, and napalm bombs, as well as indiscriminate bombing of peaceful Korean cities and residents. The governments of all countries should ratify and declare their adherence to the 1925 Geneva Protocol.
	IV. After the armistice in Korea is achieved, all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, should be withdrawn from Korea immediately.

The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, in order to restore peace in Korea and to safeguard peace in the Asian and Pacific regions, believes that the governments of the countries concerned, including the representatives of North and South Korea, should immediately conduct consultations to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on the basis of the armistice, and allow the Korean people to solve Korea's internal affairs themselves.

The arduous struggle waged by the Korean people has won and will continue to win the warm sympathy and support of the people of the world. This conference calls on all the people of the Asian and Pacific regions and the people of the world to actively support the above demands, so that the Korean issue can be resolved on a fair and reasonable basis as soon as possible, so that the heroic Korean people can live in peace.

    关于朝鲜问题的决议
    朝鲜战争仍在继续。亚洲及世界人民所渴望早日获得协议的停战谈判，已因美国代表拒绝遣返全部战俘并片面决定无限期休会而遭受重大阻挠。以毁灭和平城市与和平居民为目的的大规模轰炸正在广泛进行。毒气弹、凝固汽油弹仍被大量使用。屠杀与虐待战俘的事件愈益频繁。在朝鲜所进行的细菌战给世界人民带来了极大的威胁，同时中国人民也成为细菌武器的攻击目标。这些事实业已为国际科学委员会的调查所证实。中国的领土台湾仍被占领，中国的边境和领海、领空继续受到直接挑衅的侵犯。日本的军国主义势力正被加紧复活。这些情况，使朝鲜战争有延长和扩大的危险，并使远东局势更加严重。
    鉴于上述危险情势，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议认为，为了本区域十六万万人民的利益，有必要号召全世界人民一致起来要求：
    一、美国停战谈判代表应根据协商解决国际纠纷的原则，立即停止破坏朝鲜停战谈判的无理行动。
    二、朝鲜交战双方应根据国际公法及国际惯例，特别是一九四九年日内瓦公约的规定和已经达成协议的停战协定条款，遣返全部战俘，立即停止敌对行动。
    三、立即禁止和停止美军使用一切大规模毁灭性的武器，包括细菌武器、毒气弹、凝固汽油弹在内，以及对朝鲜和平城市与居民的滥肆轰炸。一切国家的政府应批准并宣布遵守一九二五年日内瓦议定书。
    四、在朝鲜停战实现之后，一切外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军在内，应立即从朝鲜撤退。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，为了恢复朝鲜的和平，并为了维护亚洲及太平洋区域的和平，认为有关国家的政府包括南北朝鲜的代表在内，应即进行协商，以谋进一步在停战的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题，并让朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜的内政问题。
    朝鲜人民所作的艰苦的斗争，业已赢得了并将继续赢得全世界人民的热烈同情与支持。本会议号召亚洲及太平洋区域全体人民和全世界人民积极支持上述要求，尽早使朝鲜问题在公平合理的基础上获得解决，以便英勇的朝鲜人民能在和平中生活。
                                一九五二年十月十二日于北京
