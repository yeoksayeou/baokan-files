    Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' Entry into Korea by Working Hard in Production
    Editor: October 25th marks the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into Korea. For the past two years, our most beloved people have fought alongside the Korean People's Army and achieved glorious victories. This has not only protected our hard-won fruits of victory, but also given us the opportunity to rebuild and repair our homes. Recently, we saw in the newspapers that American imperialism unilaterally suspended the Korean armistice talks, attempting to expand the war of aggression. In order to commemorate the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into Korea with practical actions, on the evening of October 9th, we held a mass meeting of the entire group, guaranteeing to do the following work: (1) Autumn harvest work. During the autumn harvest, in addition to consolidating and developing the original three mutual aid teams (one permanent, two seasonal), we will also organize temporary variable labor mutual assistance, give play to the spirit of unity and fraternity, and achieve rapid harvesting, threshing, drying, and storage, and will never waste a single grain. After the patriotic public grain task is assigned to each household, we guarantee to complete the payment task within three days. Deliver good grain and clean grain. (2) Ensure that each household conscientiously selects seeds in the field to lay a good foundation for a bumper harvest next year. (3) Although this year is a year of great harvest, we will never waste grain. We will continue to respond to Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and guarantee to plant 20 percent more winter crops such as wheat, soybeans, peas, and rapeseed than last year. (4) Conscientiously do a good job in preferential treatment work. Change the substitute cultivation system to a contracted cultivation system, contract for guaranteed output, and help solve the difficulties in the lives of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers at any time.

    以努力生产纪念志愿军出国作战两周年
    编辑同志：十月二十五日是中国人民志愿军出国作战的两周年。两年来，我们最可爱的人和朝鲜人民军并肩作战已取得了辉煌的胜利。这不仅保卫住了我们既得的胜利果实，而且使我们有条件来重整和修建自己的家园。最近我们从报纸上看到美帝国主义又片面中止朝鲜停战谈判，企图扩大侵略战争。为了以实际行动纪念志愿军出国作战两周年，十月九日晚，我们召开了全组群众大会，保证做好下列工作：（1）秋收工作。在秋收中，除了巩固和发展原有三个互助组（一个常年的，两个季节性的）外，并组织临时的变工互助，发挥团结友爱精神，做到快割、快打、快晒、快藏，决不糟蹋一点粮食。爱国公粮布置到户后，保证三天完成缴纳任务。送好粮，送净粮。（2）保证每户都切实做到田间选种，为明年的大丰收打好底子。（3）今年虽是一个大大的丰收年，但决不浪费粮食。我们要继续响应毛主席关于增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军的号召，保证比去年多种百分之二十的麦子、大豆、豌豆、油菜等冬季农作物。（4）切实做好优抚工作。改代耕制为包耕制，包耕保产量，并随时帮助解决烈、军属生活上的困难。
