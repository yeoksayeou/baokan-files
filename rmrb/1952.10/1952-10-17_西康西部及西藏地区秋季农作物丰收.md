    Autumn Harvest of Crops in Western Xikang and Tibetan Regions

    From the banks of the Jinsha River in the east to the banks of the Yarlung Tsangpo River in the west, western Xikang and the Tibetan region have generally enjoyed a bountiful autumn harvest.

    The main agricultural areas of central Tibet, such as the Yarlung Tsangpo River basin and the Lhasa Plain, have achieved the best harvest in a decade this year. The output of highland barley and wheat on the Lhasa Plain has increased by an average of double compared to last year. The highland barley harvest in Shigatse, Namling, and Panam in the rear Tibet area has also increased by 10% compared to the average yield of the past ten years. The Lazhi area has had its first great harvest in twenty years. Although some areas of the Qamdo region on the west bank of the Jinsha River have suffered from drought, the total grain output of the region still exceeds any previous year. According to incomplete statistics from Jiangda Zong alone, the total grain output this year has increased by 25,000 jin compared to previous years.

    The reason for the bumper harvest in western Xikang and the Tibetan agricultural region this year is not only due to fewer natural disasters than in previous years, but also to the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) entry into Tibet, distributing agricultural loans and seeds in various places, and helping farmers solve difficulties such as the lack of seeds and farm tools, which greatly improved farmers' enthusiasm for production. The PLA's exemplary actions in vigorously reclaiming wasteland for production also encouraged farmers in various places to expand cultivated areas and increase grain production. This year, more than 2,500 mu of new wasteland has been reclaimed in the Qamdo area. Farmers have also improved their farming techniques compared to previous years, with weeding and fertilization becoming more common. In the Shigatse area, the highland barley fields have been generally weeded once, and the amount of manure transported from the pastoral areas north of the river has increased by 90,000 loads compared to previous years. In Qingduo and Suowaka in Bomi County and other places, production committees have also been organized to mutually resolve difficulties such as farming livestock, farm tools, and seeds.

    During the autumn harvest season, the People's Liberation Army in various places organized autumn harvest teams to help the local people harvest crops. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西康西部及西藏地区秋季农作物丰收
    东起金沙江畔，西至雅鲁藏布江沿岸的西康西部及西藏地区，秋季农作物普遍获得丰收。
    西藏中部雅鲁藏布江流域和拉萨平原等主要农业区，今年获得十年来从未有过的好收成。拉萨平原上的青稞、小麦的产量平均比去年增加了一倍。后藏日喀则、南木林、巴南等地的青稞收获比过去十年中常年产量也增加了一成；拉孜地区获得了二十年来的第一次大丰收。金沙江西岸昌都地区虽有部分地区受旱，但全区粮食总产量仍超过过去任何一年。仅据江达宗一地不完全统计，今年粮食的总产量比往年增加二万五千斤。
    今年西康西部及西藏农业地区所以获得丰收，除自然灾害较往年为少外，人民解放军进藏部队在各地发放农业贷款和种籽，帮助农民解决缺少种籽和农具等困难，大大提高了农民的生产情绪。人民解放军大力进行开荒生产的模范行动，也鼓舞了各地农民扩大耕地面积，增加粮食产量的积极性。昌都地区今年新开的荒地有两千五百多亩。农民们在耕作技术上也较往年有了改进，拔草、施肥等工作已较前普遍。日喀则地区的青稞田都普遍拔了一次草，今年从江北牧区运粪的数量，比往年增加了九万驮。波密地区的倾多、索瓦卡等地还组织了生产委员会，相互解决了耕畜、农具、种籽等困难。
