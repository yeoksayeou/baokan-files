Title: The U.S. Driving More Syngman Rhee Troops and Accomplice Armies to Their Deaths Cannot Escape the Tragic Fate of Increasing U.S. Casualties

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 24th: Although the American aggressors have suffered heavy casualties in the small Korean War, deeply feeling that they cannot afford the deaths and facing increasingly fierce opposition from their own people, they are still unwilling to realize peace in Korea and are desperately plotting to drive more Syngman Rhee troops and accomplice armies to die in place of American troops.

Recently, Eisenhower and his ilk from the Republican Party have clamored loudly for the sinister policy of using "Asians to fight Asians." Truman's Secretary of Defense Lovett also triumphantly proclaimed that the number of Syngman Rhee troops killed was 50% higher than that of U.S. troops, and the number wounded was 40% higher. At the same time, Acheson is pressuring America's "allies" at the United Nations General Assembly to contribute more cannon fodder to the Korean War. The "Wall Street Journal" of October 13th, in discussing the U.S. government's policy of continuing the Korean War, stated: "As the war continues, U.S. losses should become increasingly lighter." In other words, the U.S. government wants to shift the vast majority of the losses from continuing the Korean War onto its "allies."

However, the facts of the Korean War over the past two years have long proven that this American calculation is not satisfactory. Besides deceiving the increasingly demoralized American soldiers and the American people, it cannot reduce U.S. casualties at all. As everyone knows, on June 25, 1950, the American side instigated the Syngman Rhee troops to launch a war of aggression, but as soon as they made contact, the Syngman Rhee troops were utterly defeated. The U.S. government then personally entered the war and used all its pressure to force soldiers from more than a dozen countries to fight in Korea, but the result was the same disastrous defeat. And now, the defeated American side actually attempts to use the already defeated Syngman Rhee troops and the hastily assembled accomplice armies to achieve its aggressive goals; this roundabout method is clearly impossible to save their defeat.

Under this bloody policy of the American side, more and more Syngman Rhee troops are being cruelly driven to the battlefield to die. Taking the "White Horse Mountain" battle, which the American side has recently been touting, as an example, the Syngman Rhee army's 9th Division lost more than 5,000 men in a few days just to seize a hilltop. According to Agence France-Presse on October 12th, the "fierce artillery fire" of the Korean-Chinese People's forces "turned everything on the ground of this mountain upside down." The Syngman Rhee army's "wounded soldiers were streaming down the hillside," while more "lazy soldiers" with "torn and dirty uniforms" continued to be driven to "step up the mountain to fight again." Even the commander of the Syngman Rhee army's 9th Division complained to a United Press reporter that he "had lost his best battalion commander, company commander, and platoon leader." From these facts, one can also see the tragic end of the Syngman Rhee troops being forced to die in large numbers.

The armies of various accomplice countries are also frequently driven by American commanders to the most dangerous areas to act as a shield. But these accomplice armies have also suffered one defeat after another, with casualties increasing daily. For example, the losses of the British army, the number one accomplice, if we calculate June as 100, the casualties in July were more than four times those in June, August increased to fourteen times those in June, and the multiple of September to June was almost equal to that of August. Even former Commonwealth Division Commander Cassels had to admit that the Korean-Chinese People's forces' artillery was "bigger and better than before, and was often used more accurately." He also admitted, "Almost every day, we have casualties." Other examples include the Greek battalion, which recently suffered not only heavy blows from our army, but also indiscriminate bombing by the U.S. Air Force on the front lines, resulting in many deaths and injuries.

While the casualties of the Syngman Rhee troops and accomplice armies are constantly and drastically increasing, the losses of the U.S. military have not only not decreased, but have increased instead. In the five months from May to September, the total number of casualties of the so-called United Nations forces was more than 105,000, of which the U.S. military's casualties accounted for nearly half, at more than 49,000. The average casualties of the U.S. military in June, July, and August were about twice the casualties in May, while September's were more than 2.2 times. In order to save morale and alleviate the dissatisfaction of the people at home, American generals let soldiers wear so-called "nylon flak jackets" that are, in fact, penetrated by bullets. The American side also promoted the idea that Syngman Rhee troops will soon be able to die in place of Americans, and at the same time, they increasingly shamelessly fabricated U.S. military "achievements" and reduced the figures of U.S. military casualties. However, the reality of heavy U.S. military casualties and insufficient replenishment is so relentless that Clark recently had to publicly announce the extension of the rotation period for U.S. troops invading Korea. From this, one can also see the result of the American side continuing and expanding the war in this brutal gamble.

The American side must now accept the lessons of history, honestly resolve the issue of prisoners of war in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the principle of repatriating prisoners of war in the already agreed draft armistice agreement, and realize the Korean armistice. Otherwise, tens of thousands of American soldiers will continue to die in the mountains of Korea, and the soldiers of the satellite countries and the Syngman Rhee troops can only be buried in large numbers, and will never be able to die as substitutes.

### 美国驱使更多的李伪军和帮凶军去送死  并不能逃脱美军伤亡日益增加的悲惨下场

    美国驱使更多的李伪军和帮凶军去送死
    并不能逃脱美军伤亡日益增加的悲惨下场
    【新华社开城二十四日电】美国侵略者虽然在小小的朝鲜战争中蒙受了大量的伤亡，深深感到死人死不起，而且遭到了本国人民愈来愈厉害的反对，但是他们仍然不愿实现朝鲜和平，竭力策划驱使更多的李伪军和帮凶军来代替美国军队送死。
    最近，共和党的艾森豪威尔之流大声叫嚷所谓用“亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴险政策。杜鲁门政府的国防部长罗维特也得意洋洋地宣传李伪军被打死的数字已较美军多出百分之五十，被打伤的多出百分之四十。同时，艾奇逊正在联合国大会上压迫美国的“同盟国”为侵朝战争交纳更多炮灰。十月十三日的“华尔街日报”在谈到美国政府继续侵朝战争的政策时说：“当战争继续的时候，美军的损失应该愈来愈轻微。”换句话说，美国政府要把继续进行侵朝战争的绝大部分损失转嫁到它的“盟友”身上去。
    但是，朝鲜战争两年多来的事实早已证明：美方这把算盘并不如意，除了欺骗士气日益低落的美国士兵和美国人民外，一点也不能减少美军的伤亡。众所周知，在一九五○年六月二十五日，美方策动李伪军发动了侵略战争，但是刚一接触，李伪军就被打得落花流水。美国政府于是亲自动手投入战争，并且用尽压力陆续逼使十几个国家的士兵来到朝鲜作战，可是结果也一样遭受了惨败。而现在，失败了的美方又居然企图利用早已被打败的李伪军和东拼西凑的帮凶军来实现其侵略目的；这种兜圈子办法显然不可能挽救他们的败局。
    在美方的这种血腥政策之下，愈来愈多的李伪军被残忍地驱策到战场上去送死。就以美方最近大吹大擂的“白马山”争夺战来说，李伪军第九师仅仅为争夺一个山头，几天之内就被歼灭五千多名。据法新社十月十二日报道，朝中人民部队的“猛烈的炮火把这座山的地面上的每一样东西都翻过身来了”。李伪军的“伤兵川流不息地从山坡上送下来”，而更多的“制服又破又脏”的“懒洋洋的士兵”继续被驱策“迈步上山再战”。连李伪军第九师师长也向合众社的记者诉苦说，他“已经损失了他的最好的营长、连长和排长”。从这些事实也可看到李伪军被迫大批送死的悲惨末路了。
    各帮凶国军队也经常被美国指挥官们驱使到最危险的地区去挡头阵。但是这些帮凶军也一样一败涂地，伤亡日益增加。例如头号帮凶英国军队的损失，以六月份为一百来计算，七月份伤亡为六月份的四倍以上，八月份更增加到六月份的十四倍，而九月份对六月份的倍数也几乎与八月的相等。连前英联邦师师长卡塞尔也不得不承认：朝中部队的大炮“比以前更大更好，而且使用起来常是更为准确”。他又承认，“差不多每天，我们都有伤亡”。其他如希腊营，最近不但受到我军的沉重打击，而且在前线还遭到美国空军的盲目轰炸，死伤了好多人。
    李伪军和帮凶军的伤亡固然不断急剧增加，美军的损失也不但没有减少，反而是增加了。自五月到九月的五个月中，所谓联合国军的总伤亡人数是十万五千余人，其中美军的伤亡就占了几近一半，是四万九千余人。美军六、七、八各月伤亡平均约占五月伤亡的二倍，九月份的则为二·二倍以上。为了挽救低沉的士气，缓和国内人民的不满，美国将军们让士兵穿起了事实上枪弹一打就穿的所谓“尼龙避弹衣”。美方还大事宣传李伪军不久就能代替美国人送死，同时愈来愈无耻地捏造美军的“战绩”，缩小美军的伤亡数字。可是美军伤亡惨重、补充不及的现实是如此无情，以致克拉克最近不得不公开声明延长侵朝美军的轮换期。从这里，也就可以看出美方继续及扩大战争这一残暴赌博的结果了。
    美方现在必须接受历史的教训，老老实实按照日内瓦公约和已经协议的停战协定草案中遣返战俘的原则解决战俘问题，实现朝鲜停战。否则，成千累万的美国士兵将继续在朝鲜的群山中死亡，仆从国的士兵及李伪军只能大批殉葬，永远无法替死。
