    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 16th. TASS Moscow, October 13th: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Pushkin received U.S. Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to the Soviet Union, Mr. Aushohnessy, on October 12th and handed him a note which reads as follows:
    "The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics considers it necessary to inform the United States of America of the following circumstances.
    "According to reliable reports from relevant Soviet authorities, at approximately 15:30 (Vladivostok time) on October 7th of this year, a four-engine B-29 bomber with U.S. markings intruded into the Soviet border in the area of Yuli Island (transliteration). Two Soviet fighter planes that took off requested the U.S. bomber to follow them to a nearby airport to land. The aircraft that intruded into the Soviet border not only refused to comply with the legitimate demands made by the Soviet fighter planes, but also opened fire on the Soviet fighter planes. After the Soviet fighter planes returned fire, the U.S. aircraft fled towards the sea.
    "The Soviet Government strongly protests the recent intrusion of a U.S. military aircraft into the Soviet border, and insists that the U.S. Government take measures to prevent U.S. aircraft from intruding into the Soviet border."
    Mr. Aushohnessy stated that he would immediately forward the note to the U.S. Government.

    苏联政府抗议美国军用飞机侵犯苏联国境
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：苏联外交部副部长普式金十月十二日接见美国驻苏临时代办奥斯豪尼西，交给他一件照会，照会如下：
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府认为必须向美利坚合众国说明下述情况。
    “根据苏联有关机关的可靠报告，今年十月七日十五时三十分（海参崴时间）左右，有一架涂有美国标志的四引擎B29型轰炸机，侵犯尤利岛（译音）地区的苏联国境，两架起飞的苏联战斗机要求美国轰炸机跟随它们在附近的机场着陆。这架侵犯苏联国境的飞机不仅不接受苏联战斗机所提出的合法要求，反而向苏联战斗机开枪。经苏联战斗机回击后，美国飞机向海上逃逸。
    “苏联政府坚决抗议最近美国军用飞机侵犯苏联国境的事件，并且坚持要求美国政府采取措施防止美国飞机侵犯苏联国境。”
    奥斯豪尼西说：他将立刻把这个照会转给美国政府。
