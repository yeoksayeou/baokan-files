    A New Almanac Beloved by Farmers
    Zhao Lao
    The new almanac has become one of the most beloved books by the broad masses of the people, especially the peasants. It is a daily handbook for farmers in production, study, and life.
    According to incomplete statistics, sales of the 1952 new almanac reached 30 million copies. This year, the North China People's Publishing House and the Beijing People's Publishing House jointly edited and published the 1953 new almanac, and its first edition was printed in 3 million copies. With the development of the rapid literacy movement and the reduction of illiteracy, the sales of the new almanac will greatly increase.
    The almanac has a deep and far-reaching influence in China's rural areas. Because China was a country mainly based on agriculture in the past, every farming family had to master the seasons of cold and heat and sow and harvest on time. People can check the seasons and calculate the days of production from the almanac. The important material of the almanac—the twenty-four solar terms—made very complete arrangements for agricultural production and seasons (such as sowing during Qingming, transplanting rice seedlings during Guyu; when the Xiaoman flowers bloom, don't go home, etc.). The Spring Ox picture and the Water Management picture in the almanac also express the farmers' feelings and hopes for production and harvest, so it reflects the farmers' demands and suits the farmers' needs.
    Also, because China's calendar science achieved great accomplishments very early (such as intercalating months in the Yin and Zhou dynasties, and having complete twenty-four solar terms in the Qin and Han dynasties), and the calendar science of successive dynasties made many contributions, it provided conditions for the development of the almanac. Therefore, it is not accidental that the almanac has a broad and deep influence in China.
    However, under the long-term rule and influence of feudal emperors, the almanac was used by feudal emperors. The almanac must be "钦定" (Qīndìng, Imperially commissioned), or arranged in accordance with books such as the "钦定历象考成" (Qīndìng Lìxiàng Kǎochéng, Imperially Commissioned Comprehensive Compendium on Calendrical Astronomy), and the almanac became the "皇历" (Huánglì, Imperial Almanac). As a result, things like "inauspicious star charts," "Tui Bei Tu prophecies," "nine palace marriage compatibility," and "Celestial Master exorcising diseases" all appeared in the almanac. In this way, useful calendar knowledge was mixed with yin and yang, the five elements, and superstitious legends. Simple wishes for harvest, marriage, etc., were introduced into the wrong path of "heavenly destiny" and fatalism. The almanac became more and more absurd and contained toxins.
    What's worse, even the diary of the almanac was added with "suitable for what" and "unsuitable for what" in an attempt to limit people's daily life. And the corrupt parasites created by the old social system—doctors, diviners, astrologers, etc.—further used the fact that people did not know the calendar knowledge, and used the zodiac and the nine palaces (original calendar names) to far-fetchedly associate and babble nonsense. In this way, the bad habits of the old society—looking at the calendar for auspicious days before going out, matching horoscopes for marriage, and burning talismans when sick—were all based on the almanac, and the almanac became one of the important bases of superstition and fatalism.
    In the past three years, the people's publishing organs have transformed the old almanac, removed the garbage and feudal superstitious toxins from the old almanac, and let it serve the farmers and meet the requirements of agricultural production. This is primarily due to the fact that the farmers have turned over and their consciousness has been raised. They said, "The old almanac can no longer be read," "It is no longer the time to read the imperial almanac." They satirized the old almanac, saying, "Break ground today, start the stove tomorrow, hungry and rumbling!" They praised the new almanac, saying, "Politics and production are promoted, every family is happy with a bumper harvest." No wonder the new almanac has such a large circulation figure.
    The new almanac has sections on political common sense, agricultural production scientific knowledge, life, and the calendar. Putting political content in the almanac is also one of the characteristics of the new almanac, which the old almanac never had. The "Love Our Great Motherland" and "The Glorious Thirty Years of Struggle of the Communist Party of China" in the 1952 new almanac, and the "The Great Achievements of Our Motherland in the Past Three Years" and "Our Friends Are All Over the World" in the 1953 new almanac, all promoted patriotism and internationalism. Due to the concentration and conciseness of the content, it has a very deep impact on the readers. The new almanac also includes many important laws and regulations, which can not only publicize the various policies and laws of the People's Government, but also facilitate people's reference.
    The content of agricultural production includes organizing, mutual aid and cooperation, bumper harvest patriotism, and increasing unit area yield. It also introduces bumper harvest experiences, production techniques and methods, and production knowledge on preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. Scientific knowledge pays attention to cooperation with the hygiene movement; and also focuses on introducing maternal and child health. In addition, according to the observations of the Nanjing Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the error of calculating "June small, July large" in the 10,000-year calendar in 1953 was corrected (next year it should be "June large, July small"), and the natural phenomenon of "solar eclipse and lunar eclipse" was scientifically explained.
    The life section, such as New Year couplets and age comparison tables, has been retained according to custom.
    The new almanac is for the peasant masses, so it must be as popular as possible, the font should be large, and there should be more pictures. At present, this aspect is not done well enough. But to compile a good new almanac is not an easy task, and the strength of the publishing department alone is not enough. It should also obtain the help and cooperation of relevant departments such as the agricultural department, the astronomical research department, and the health propaganda department.

    为农民喜爱的新历书
    赵劳
    新历书已经成为广大人民，尤其是农民群众最喜爱的书籍之一。它是农民生产、学习和生活日用的手册。
    一九五二年新历书，据不完全的统计，销售达三千万册。今年，华北人民出版社和北京人民出版社    联合编辑出版了一九五三年新历书，它的初版就印刷了三百万册；随着速成识字运动的开展，文盲的减少，新历书的销数将大大地增加。
    历书在我国农村中有着较深、较远的影响。因为我国过去是以农业为主的国家，每一个农家都必须掌握寒暑的季节，按时播种收割。人们可以从历书上查季节，计算生产的日子。而历书的重要材料——二十四节气，更把农业生产和季节作了十分完满的安排（如清明下种、谷雨插秧；小满花，不回家等）。历书中的春牛图，治水图也表现了农民对于生产和丰收的感情和希望，所以它反映着农民的要求和适合农民的需要。
    还有，由于我国历学老早就有了很大的成就（如殷周就有了分月置闰，秦汉就有了完备的二十四节气），而历代的历学又有不少贡献，给历书的发展提供了条件。所以，历书在我国有广大、深入的影响，并不是偶然的。
    可是，在封建帝王的长期统治和影响下，历书被封建帝王利用了。历书必须由帝王“钦定”，或遵照“钦定”的“历象考成”之类的书去编排，历书成为“皇历”了，于是什么“凶星图”、“推背图”、“九宫合婚”、“天师祛病”都上了历书。就这样，有用的历象知识就和阴阳五行、迷信神怪的传说混淆起来了；丰收、婚姻等朴素愿望被引入“天定”宿命的歧途。历书愈来愈荒唐，而含有毒素了。
    更坏的是，连历书的日志也被加上“宜什么”、“忌什么”，想把人民日常生活也加以限制。而旧社会制度所造成的腐朽的寄生者——医卜星相之流等，更利用人民不知道历象知识，用黄道、九宫
    （原历象名称）来牵强附会，胡说八道。这样，旧社会的坏习惯——出门看日子，合婚对八字，有病烧符等都依据历书了，历书成为迷信、宿命的重要根据之一。
    三年来，人民的出版机关改造了旧历书，把旧历书中的垃圾和封建迷信的毒素清除出去，让它为农民服务，适合农业生产的要求。这首先由于农民翻身了，他们的觉悟提高了。他们说：“旧历书再也看不得了”，“不是看皇历的时候了”。他们讽刺了旧历书，说：“今天动土，明天起灶，饿的咕咕叫！”对于新历书他们称赞说：“政治、生产来宣扬，家家丰收喜洋洋。”无怪乎新历书有了这样大的发行数字。
    新历书有政治常识、农业生产科学知识、生活和日历等部分。而把政治内容放在历书里面，也是新历书的特点之一，旧历书是从来没有过的。一九五二年新历书的“爱我们伟大的祖国”、“中国共产党光荣奋斗三十年”，一九五三年新历书的“我们祖国三年来伟大的成就”、“我们的朋友遍于全世界”，都宣传了爱国主义和国际主义。由于内容的集中、精练，它给读者以很深的影响。新历书还编有许多重要法令，这不仅可以宣传人民政府的各种政策、法令，而且便于人们的查考。
    农业生产方面的内容有组织起来、互助合作、丰产爱国、提高单位面积产量等，还介绍了丰产经验、生产技术方法、防治病虫害等生产知识。科学知识注意配合卫生运动；妇幼卫生，也着重介绍了。此外，还根据中国科学院南京紫金山天文台的观测，修正了万年历推算一九五三年“六月小、七月大”的错误（明年应为“六月大、七月小”），科学地说明了“日蚀与月蚀”的自然现象。
    生活部分如新春联、年龄对照表都依据习惯保留了。
    新历书是给农民群众看的，因此必须尽量作到通俗，字体要大，图要多，目前在这方面还做得不够。但要编好一本新历书，不是一件容易的事，光靠出版部门的力量是不够的，还应当取得有关部门如农业部门、天文研究部门、卫生宣传部门的帮助和合作。
