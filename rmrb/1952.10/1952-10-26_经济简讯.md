	Nanjing City Construction Achieved Great Success in the Past Three Years
	Since the liberation of Nanjing in April 1949, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government has invested significant effort in the construction of a people's city. Over the past three years, a total of 1,356,441 square meters of roads have been built and repaired, equivalent to half of all road surfaces built during the Kuomintang's 22 years of reactionary rule. More than 282,000 meters of sewers have been constructed and renovated, and more than 167,000 meters of various new-style pipe trenches have been built. This construction is equivalent to half the total length of sewers built in Nanjing during the Ming and Qing dynasties plus the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. The People's Government also dredged more than 317,000 cubic meters of rivers such as the Qinhuai River, and repaired more than 167,000 meters of ditches. As a result of these constructions, smooth roads have appeared in the streets and alleys where the working people live, and the phenomenon of water accumulation during the rainy season has been basically eliminated. In terms of the cultural welfare of the working people, the People's Government built a grand Workers' Cultural Palace and a Workers' Hospital. In addition, a People's Hospital was established specifically for the city's poor patients, so that poor citizens with urgent illnesses can receive treatment at any time.
	Industrial Production Cooperative Undertakings in Northeast China Developed Substantially
	Industrial production cooperative undertakings in Northeast China have developed substantially. The existing industrial production cooperatives include 15 types of handicrafts such as ironwork, woodwork, clothing, knitting, footwear, and ceramics, with more than 300 products. Among them, the products with the largest output are iron, wood, leather, and agricultural tools, with an annual output of 400,000 pieces. This production has played a significant role in supplementing the shortage of certain machine-made industrial products. At present, some industrial production cooperatives in Northeast China have used accumulated funds to add machines and are transitioning to machine production.
	Minji Village in Heilongjiang Province Creates New Record of Overall Bumper Harvest This Year
	Minji Village in Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, which was awarded by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government last year, has created a new record of overall bumper harvest this year. According to a pre-harvest survey, the average yield per hectare in Minji Village this year will reach 5,000 catties, an increase of 33.6% over last year. The higher bumper harvest achieved by Minji Village this year is precisely because of the earnest development of the patriotic production increase campaign on the basis of comprehensive organization.
