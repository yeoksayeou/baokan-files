    Learning from Jiao Zhenyang's Spirit of Responsibility
    Editor: Jiao Zhenyang, a deliveryman at the Taiyuan Telecommunications Bureau, was delivering a telegram to Qianyicheng Hotel, No. 2 West Jia Lane on August 2nd. The recipient, Fu Xunxu, had already left the hotel to go to the train station to buy a ticket back to Fushun. Originally, this telegram could have been returned to the sender as an undeliverable "dead telegram," but he thought that the telegram was about a state-owned factory in the Northeast requesting funds, and if the recipient did not receive it, it might delay things. So he ran to the station and, seeing that the train had not yet left, hurried to the station's broadcasting room and asked the announcer to broadcast the message several times, but no one came to claim it. Jiao Zhenyang then ran to the ticket gate and shouted a few times, and sure enough, a person came up to Jiao Zhenyang and said, "I am Fu Xunxu," while producing his identification. Jiao Zhenyang, seeing that it was correct, handed him the telegram. In the past six months, Jiao Zhenyang has resurrected "dead telegrams" seven times. This attitude of being conscientious and responsible in one's work is worth learning from. Niu Weijun

    学习焦振扬负责到底的工作精神
    编辑同志：太原电信局投递员焦振扬，在八月二日送一份电报到西夹巷二号谦义成旅店时，收报人傅循序已离店往车站买票回抚顺去了。本来这份电报可作为投递不到的“死报”退给发报人了，但是他想电报内容是关于东北一个国营工厂拨款子的事，如果收款人收不到，可能会耽误事情，于是他就跑到车站，看见车还没开，就急忙到车站广播室里，请广播员广播，连说几遍，没人来取。焦振扬又跑到剪票的地方高叫几声，果然有一个人走来向焦振扬说：“我叫傅循序”，一边又取出他的证明。焦振扬看不错，就把电报交给他。半年来，焦振扬已经七次使“死报”复活。这种对工作认真负责的态度，是值得学习的。  牛维钧
