    Review of Several Books on Accelerated Literacy Methods
    Tu Guang
    Recently, with the widespread promotion of accelerated literacy methods, various teaching materials and reference books on accelerated literacy methods have been published in various places. Among these teaching materials and reference books, the following are worth recommending to readers: the "Accelerated Literacy Textbook" published by the Northeast People's Publishing House, the "Accelerated Literacy Handbook" published by the Beijing People's Publishing House, and the "Introduction to Accelerated Literacy Methods" published by the China Youth Publishing House.
    The "Accelerated Literacy Textbook" was compiled by the Education Department of the Northeast People's Government and is specifically for use in accelerated literacy teaching in workers' spare-time schools. It is a textbook compiled by concentrating the experience of rapid character acquisition in accelerated literacy experiments in various places, and it is both political and popular. According to the standard of accelerated literacy quantity, the textbook includes a total of two thousand commonly used single characters, forming simple vocabulary, and is divided into thirty units in the order of text depth and frequency of use, with fifty to ninety new characters in each unit. This is in line with the experience of the best average of seventy to eighty new characters per night proposed by various places. The word list of this accelerated literacy textbook has the following advantages: First, it is compiled according to the basic principle of combining single characters into disyllabic words, which makes it easy for teachers and students to explain, understand, and remember when rushing through the word list. Second, each textbook's word list is appended with a non-phonetic single character list in the order of the number of strokes, allowing students to review, which can overcome the problem of "tongue twisters" that easily occur when rushing through the word list. Third, at the end of the word list, a character list indexed by pronunciation is attached, which is very convenient for students to read and write after rushing through the new characters.
    The "Accelerated Literacy Handbook" is also a good textbook. Its phonetic word list includes the 1,500 commonly used characters announced by the Central Ministry of Education and all the new characters in the "Workers' Literacy Textbook" and "Farmers' Literacy Textbook." One feature of this book is that the editors combine words with similar meanings into one or several lessons, making it easier for students to concentrate their understanding when rushing through the new characters. At the end of the book, several short and popular poems and narrative texts are also selected, which is also a good attempt, but the length seems a little short.
    "Introduction to Accelerated Literacy Methods" is the best reference book for studying accelerated literacy methods. It has been carefully selected by the China Youth Publishing House and reviewed by the General Political Department of the Military Commission. The book concentrates on some relatively mature summaries of advanced accelerated literacy method experimental work, such as the "Summary of the Work of the Accelerated Literacy Teaching Experiment Class for Chongqing Textile Workers," and the Director Lin Handa of the Central Ministry of Education's "Introduction to the Teaching Experience of the Gaobeidian Farmers' Accelerated Literacy Class," etc. These summary texts powerfully prove that the accelerated literacy method is a feasible and effective literacy teaching method among the workers and peasants. In particular, the article "Talks on Accelerated Literacy Methods" systematically introduces the methods and principles of ideological mobilization, teaching phonetic alphabets and pinyin, rushing through new characters, reading, writing, and writing in accelerated literacy teaching, which can be used as a reference for training accelerated literacy teachers. However, this book lacks some vivid examples of promoting the accelerated literacy movement, which is a shortcoming.
    In addition, in terms of reference books on accelerated literacy methods, several materials compiled and printed by the Shanghai Labor Publishing House, the Central South People's Publishing House, and the Southern Jiangsu Education Society are also good readings, but they are not concise enough. "Introduction to Qi Jianhua's Accelerated Literacy Method" compiled and printed by Guangming Daily is also a good book, but because it was published earlier, there is less material.
    Some private publishers in Beijing have also published some reference books on phonetic alphabets, which can also help teachers study the pronunciation methods of each phonetic alphabet. However, they have a common shortcoming: the editors and authors of these books have not studied the accelerated literacy method well and have excessively emphasized the role of phonetic alphabets. For example, the book "How to Learn Phonetic Alphabets" published by Beijing Xuanwen Bookstore says: "In every textbook with phonetic alphabets, you can read it yourself without asking the teacher when you study by yourself." The "Usage of Phonetic Alphabets" published by Beijing Baowentang Bookstore says: "Phonetic alphabets can annotate Chinese characters and can also be used to spell languages. If we learn it, we can quickly read books and newspapers with phonetic notation (readings printed with 'phonetic Chinese characters')." The authors of these books do not know that after learning with the accelerated literacy method, those who know characters can read popular readings without phonetic alphabets. Some of these books also have illustrations of phonetic alphabets that are not serious or have ambiguous meanings, are difficult to understand, or the illustrations and sounds are inconsistent. The worst is "The Crutch of Accelerated Literacy Method—Usage of Phonetic Symbols" published by Beijing Wenda Bookstore, which is completely a crudely made speculative publication. In the thin dozen pages, it is full of spelling and writing errors. I hope that the editors and authors of these books can seriously study the accelerated literacy method and improve the quality of publications.
    In the teaching materials and reference books on accelerated literacy methods, there is a lack of readings on reading and writing. And this aspect of the material is what all regions urgently need in promoting accelerated literacy methods. We hope that the cultural and educational departments, writers, and publishers will plan to organize forces to, on the one hand, review existing popular readings and republish the usable parts, and on the other hand, create a large number of new works, collect excellent creations from the masses, and help the masses create, and publish them in large quantities to meet the workers, peasants, and soldiers' thirst for popular readings after accelerated literacy learning.

    评介几本关于速成识字法的书籍
    土光
    最近，随着速成识字法的广泛推行，各地出版了很多种关于速成识字法的教材和参考书。在这些教材和参考书中，值得向读者推荐的，有东北人民出版社出版的“速成识字课本”，北京人民出版社出版的“速成识字手册”，以及青年出版社出版的“介绍速成识字法”。
    “速成识字课本”是由东北人民政府教育部编的，专供职工业余学校速成识字教学试用。它是集中了各地实验速成识字法突击生字经验所编成的一本既有政治性又很通俗化的课本。课本按照速成识字数量的标准，共编入了两千个常用单字，组成简单语汇，按文字深浅及常用程度顺序排列共分为三十单元，每单元有生字五十个至九十个。这与各地所提出的最好每晚平均突击七、八十个生字的经验相符合。这个速成识字课本的词表有下面一些优点：第一，它是按照把单字组合成双音词的基本原则编成的，这样就使得教员学员在突击词表时好讲、好懂、好记。第二，每册课本的词表后面，附印了按笔划多少为顺序的不注音单字表，使学生复习，这可克服在突击词表时易于发生的“顺口溜”的毛病。第三，它在词表的最后面，又附印了一份按音检字的字表，这对学生在突击生字后进行阅读及写作时有很大的方便。
    “速成识字手册”也是一份较好的教材。它的注音词表包括了中央教育部公布的一千五百个常用字和“职工识字课本”与“农民识字课本”上的全部生字。这本书有一个特点，编者把词义相近的词组合成一课或几课，使学员在突击生字时易于集中理解。本书后面，还选了几篇短小的通俗的诗歌和记事文，也是一个很好的尝试，但篇幅显得少些。
    “介绍速成识字法”是一本关于研究速成识字法的最好参考书。它经过青年出版社认真的选择和军委总政治部的审定。书中集中了一些比较成熟的先进的速成识字法实验工作的总结，如“重庆纺织工人速成识字教学实验班工作总结摘要”，中央教育部林汉达司长“介绍高碑店农民速成识字班的教学经验等”。这些总结性的文字，都有力地证明了速成识字法是在工农群众中间一种可行的有效的识字教学方法。特别是其中“速成识字法讲话”一篇，更有系统地介绍了速成识字教学中进行思想动员，教注音字母与拼音，突击生字，阅读，写字，写话的方法原则，可供训练速成识字师资的参考。但这本书还缺乏推广速成识字运动的一些生动的事例，这是一个缺点。
    此外，在速成识字法的参考书方面，上海劳动出版社、中南人民出版社、苏南教育社所编印的几种资料，也是较好的读物，但都不够精练。光明日报社编印的“介绍祁建华速成识字法”也是一本较好的书，不过因为出版较早，材料较少。
    北京有些私营出版家也出版了一些关于注音字母方面的参考书，这些书也可以帮助教师们研究每个注音字母的发音方法。但它们有一个共同的缺点，就是这些书的编著者都没有很好研究速成识字法，过分地强调了注音字母的作用。例如北京宣文书店出版的“怎样学习注音字母”一书中说：“在每一本有注音字母的课本，你自己自修的时候，不用问老师就能念得出来”。北京宝文堂书店出版的“注音字母使用法”说：“注音字母可以给汉字注音，也可用来拼写语言。我们学会了它，很快的就能阅读带注音的书报（用‘注音汉字’印刷的读物）。”这些书的作者，不知道在用速成识字法学习后，那些识字的人就可以读不带注音字母的通俗读物了。这些书还有些对注音字母的图解，画得不严肃或意义含糊，难以理解，或图音不一致。最坏的是北京文达书局出版的“速成识字法的拐棍——注音符号使用法”，这完全是一本粗制滥造的投机出版物。在薄薄的十几页篇幅中，充满了拼错、写错的现象。希望这些书籍的编著者能认真研究速成识字法，提高出版物的质量。
    在速成识字法的教材及参考书中，缺少关于阅读与写话方面的读物。而这一方面的材料，恰是目前各地在推行速成识字法中所迫切需要的。我们希望文教部门、作家及出版家有计划地组织力量，一方面审查已有的通俗读物，选择可用的部分重新出版，另一方面，应大量创作新的作品，搜集群众中优秀的创作，并帮助群众创作，大量出版，以满足经过速成识字学习后的工农兵群众对通俗读物的如饥似渴的要求。
