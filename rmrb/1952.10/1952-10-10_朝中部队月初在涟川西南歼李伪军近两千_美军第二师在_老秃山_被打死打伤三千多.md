Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 9th: In early October, our unit on the Western Front, in attack and blocking actions on three hilltops southwest of Yeoncheon, annihilated nearly 2,000 ROK Marine Corps 1st Regiment troops. This enemy unit was the only Marine Corps unit in the ROK army, entirely equipped with American weapons, and directly commanded by the U.S. Marine Corps 1st Division. It was one of the ROK army's "most combat-effective" units.

	At 8 PM on October 2nd, our attacking forces, with the support of powerful artillery fire, launched a swift and fierce attack on the enemy at Xichangli North Hill, Hill 67, and Hill 86.9 southwest of Yeoncheon. In less than ten minutes, all three hilltops were occupied by our forces, and the six platoons of the ROK Marine Corps 1st Regiment defending them were completely annihilated. In the three days after occupying these hilltops, the ROK Marine Corps 1st Regiment, under U.S. command, launched continuous counterattacks against our forces with all its might, but each charge was repulsed by our forces. In these three days of blocking actions, according to incomplete statistics, our forces killed or wounded over 1,660 enemy troops, destroyed or damaged 19 enemy tanks, and shot down one enemy aircraft.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 9th: The U.S. invading 2nd Infantry Division, operating in the area west of Tieyuan on the Western Front, has suffered over 3,000 casualties. A hilltop position located on the banks of the Yeokgok River, which American news agencies call "Old Baldy Hill," has become a graveyard for the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division.

	Since June, fierce battles for control have frequently occurred on "Old Baldy Hill." In mid-July, the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division, newly transferred to the Western Front, suffered a major defeat on this hilltop, with over 1,000 troops annihilated in one fell swoop by our counterattacking forces. After our forces voluntarily withdrew on August 3rd, the 2nd Division was able to climb back onto "Old Baldy Hill," which had been stripped bare by artillery fire.

	On September 18th, the 2nd Division suffered an even more severe blow than the first time – over 1,800 casualties. On that day, our artillery heavily bombarded "Old Baldy Hill," and tanks were also deployed in the battle. Smoke and dust filled the enemy's positions, and fortifications such as bunkers and barbed wire were almost completely destroyed by the artillery fire. When our artillery began to extend its fire to the enemy's rear at night, infantry assault teams bravely charged towards the enemy's positions, and in a battle lasting several tens of minutes, completely annihilated over 1,800 enemies on the hill.

	While the battle was in progress, the enemy sent out two more companies of infantry and five tanks to rescue their comrades. However, this enemy force was intercepted head-on by another of our units on the road. Our Communist Party member Wei Zhimin crawled to within 25 meters of the enemy and destroyed an enemy tank with an anti-tank grenade, frightening the enemy following behind the tanks into turning around and running away. At this time, our artillery concentrated its fire on this group of enemies. The enemy was thrown into chaos, with tanks and infantry crammed together, and some enemies were even run over by the tanks. After our forces stormed "Old Baldy Hill," the enemy launched more than ten frantic counterattacks, but were all repulsed by our forces with intense firepower. On one occasion, the enemy dispatched over twenty truckloads of infantry to rescue their counterattacking troops who had failed, but were all annihilated by our artillery fire on the road.

    朝中部队月初在涟川西南歼李伪军近两千
    美军第二师在“老秃山”被打死打伤三千多
    【新华社朝鲜前线九日电】十月初，西线我军某部在涟川西南三个山头的攻击和阻击战斗中，歼灭李伪军海军陆战队第一团近二千名。这支敌军部队是李伪军唯一的一支海军陆战队，全部美式装备，直接受美国海军陆战队第一师的指挥，是李伪军“战斗力最强”的部队之一。
    十月二日晚八时，我军攻击部队在强大炮火配合下，以神速动作，向涟川西南的西场里北山、六七高地和八六点九高地上的敌人突然发动了勇猛的攻击，不到十分钟，这三个山头都被我军占领，守敌李伪军海军陆战队第一团的六个排兵力被全部歼灭。在占领了这些山头以后的三天中，李伪军海军陆战队第一团在美军指挥下倾其全力向我军进行连续反扑，但每次冲锋都被我军击溃。在这三天的阻击战中，据不完全的统计，我军杀伤敌军一千六百六十多名，击毁击伤敌军坦克十九辆，击落敌机一架。
    【新华社朝鲜前线九日电】在西线铁原以西地区作战的美国侵略军第二师已遭受三千人以上的惨重伤亡；被美国通讯社称为“老秃山”的位于驿谷川河畔的一个山头阵地，已成为美国第二师的坟场。
    从六月份以来，“老秃山”上经常发生激烈的争夺战。七月中旬美军第二师刚调到西线，就在这个山头上吃了一个大败仗，被我反击部队一举歼灭了一千多人。到八月三日我军主动撤离以后，第二师才又爬上这个被炮火轰得寸草不存的“老秃山”。
    九月十八日，第二师受到了比之第一次更加严重的打击——死伤了一千八百多人。当天我军大炮向“老秃山”猛烈轰击，坦克也出动作战。敌人阵地上烟尘弥漫，地堡、铁丝网等工事几乎全部被炮火摧毁。当夜间我军大炮开始向敌后延伸射击时，步兵突击队就奋勇冲向敌人阵地，在几十分钟战斗中就将山上一千八百多敌人全部歼灭。
    当战斗正在进行的时候，敌人曾派出两个多连步兵和五辆坦克来救援他们的伙伴。但这股敌军却在路上受到了我军另一个部队的迎头拦击。我军共产党员魏治民爬到离敌人二十五公尺的地方，用反坦克手雷炸毁了一辆敌军的坦克，吓得随在坦克后面的敌人回头就跑。这时我军炮火就向这群敌人集中轰击。敌人被打得乱作一团，坦克和步兵挤在一起，有的敌人甚至被坦克从身上碾了过去。在我军攻上“老秃山”以后，敌人连续进行了十多次疯狂的反扑，都被我军以炽烈火力击退。有一次，敌人派遣二十多辆卡车的步兵赶来救援他们反扑失败的部队，但在路上就被我军炮火全部消灭。
