    To Commemorate the Second Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid to Korea
    Korean Ambassador to China, Kwon O-jik, Holds Reception
    Korean Ambassador to China, Kwon O-jik, held a reception in Beijing on the evening of the 25th to commemorate the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea.
    Those invited to attend the reception included: Chen Geng, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army; Gan Siqi, Head of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army National Day Observation Delegation, Deputy Political Commissar and Director of the Political Department of the Volunteer Army; Guo Jinsheng and Cui Jianguo, members of the delegation and combat heroes of the Volunteer Army; as well as Volunteer Army wounded and sick personnel and representatives of Volunteer Army families who have returned to China for recuperation and are currently in Beijing.
    Also invited to attend the reception were: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea; Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman; Liu Ningyi, Secretary-General; and others.
    Chinese figures invited to the meeting also included leading figures from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and military and government leaders such as Li Jishen, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, Nie Rongzhen, Xiao Hua, and others, totaling more than 250 people.
    Diplomatic envoys invited to the meeting included the ambassadors to China from the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries.
    After the reception began, Ambassador Kwon O-jik delivered a speech. Ambassador Kwon O-jik said: Two years ago, during the most difficult period of the Korean people's struggle for the freedom of their country and peace in the Far East, the great Chinese people, the fraternal neighbor of the Korean people, sent their volunteer army to Korea to aid us. He said: On this significant day, in the name of the fighting Korean people, I would like to express my deep gratitude and respect to all commanders and fighters of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the great Chinese people and their wise leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, and to extend my heartfelt sympathy and honor to the comrades who were gloriously wounded in the just struggle against the U.S. and British interventionists, and to the mothers and fathers who sent their outstanding children to the front lines in Korea. Ambassador Kwon said: The friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese people, which has a long history and is forged in blood, has been further consolidated today in the just struggle against U.S. aggression, and this force cannot be destroyed or defeated by any imperialist force. He emphasized: The U.S. aggressors' heinous acts of indiscriminately bombing peaceful cities and towns in Korea, slaughtering peaceful Korean residents, massacring our captured personnel, sabotaging armistice negotiations, and attempting to expand the war will never weaken our combat power, nor will they thwart our fighting spirit. The Korean people must further strengthen the friendship and unity with the Chinese people and resolutely fight to the end for final victory.
    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, then delivered a speech. Guo Moruo said: For two years, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai, and with the active support and love of the Korean people, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has closely united with the Korean People's Army, fought heroically, eliminated more than 660,000 enemies, dealt a heavy blow to the aggressors, and achieved a great common victory, defending the independence of Korea and the security of China, defending peace in Asia and the world, and winning the support of all peace-loving people around the world; at the same time, it has also forced the U.S. aggressors to accept and conduct armistice negotiations. He then emphasized: However, the U.S. aggressors are still not reconciled to their defeat. They are still continuing to delay and sabotage the armistice negotiations and plot to expand the war of aggression. Recently, they have even more brazenly suspended the armistice negotiations by declaring an indefinite recess, attempting to use this to pressure their satellite countries in the United Nations General Assembly to agree to their plan to expand the war of aggression. Nevertheless, the U.S. aggressors' conspiracy of aggression is bound to be completely defeated. Guo Moruo concluded: The Chinese people will continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and strive to support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and fight to the end for the complete victory of the anti-U.S. imperialist war of aggression.
    Finally, General Chen Geng, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, delivered a speech. He said: For two years, our Chinese People's Volunteer Army, together with the heroic Korean People's Army, has annihilated a total of more than 660,000 U.S. aggressor troops and their accomplice troops, driven the aggressors back to the vicinity of the "38th parallel," and shattered the U.S. aggressors' plot to destroy Korea and then invade our motherland. In the struggle against the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese people, the Korean people, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, are fighting with unyielding determination for the independence of their country and world peace. In various difficult environments, they have given us boundless care and great support, making us feel as warm as if we were in our motherland. The combat friendship forged by the flesh and blood of the Chinese and Korean people has become even more consolidated, and we are proud and honored to have such heroic Korean people and their army fighting side by side with us. General Chen Geng pointed out: But the U.S. aggressors are still continuing their criminal aggression, brazenly sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations, and plotting to expand the war of aggression. In order to shatter all the conspiracies of the aggressors, we, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, are determined to join the heroic Korean People's Army in continuing to inflict heavier blows on the aggressors who dare to invade, and to fight to the end for the early, fair, and reasonable settlement of the Korean issue and for the victorious conclusion of the Korean anti-aggression war!
    During the reception, the hosts and guests frequently toasted the health of General Kim Il-sung, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Marshal Stalin, toasted the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, toasted the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean people forged with blood, and toasted the final victory of the Chinese and Korean people's war of resistance against the United States.
    The reception proceeded in a friendly and warm atmosphere.
    Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: The Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kwon O-jik, held a film reception on the evening of the 24th, showing Korean films such as "Return to the Front," and entertained Volunteer Army representatives, Volunteer Army wounded and sick personnel, Volunteer Army family members, as well as representatives of our party and government leaders and people's organizations in Beijing.
