    The people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union are greeting the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) with a great surge of patriotism. The socialist competition in celebration of the congress is growing and expanding.

    Millions of Soviet people are showing deep interest in the upcoming congress of the Lenin-Stalin Party and are studying profoundly the documents of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) published in the newspapers. The working people have the right to be proud of the great victories our motherland has achieved in the struggle for communism.

    In his historical speech at the meeting of voters on February 9, 1946, Comrade Stalin stipulated the work plan of the Communist Party for the recent period and for a longer period. Comrade Stalin said: "As for the plan for a longer period, the Party intends to create a strong new upsurge in the national economy, enabling us to—for example—increase our country's industrial level to three times that of pre-war levels. We must enable our industry to produce 50 million tons of pig iron, 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of petroleum annually. Only when this is achieved can it be said that our motherland has a guarantee against all accidents. This will probably take three new five-year plans—perhaps a little more—to achieve. But this is possible and is what we ought to do."

    The Soviet people are implementing the plan for communist construction, successfully completing the post-war Five-Year Plan, and taking a new big step forward along the road to communism.

    Our socialist industry is developing at an unprecedented speed. The Fourth Five-Year Plan stipulated that the total industrial output of the Soviet Union in 1950—the last year of the Five-Year Plan—should increase by 48 percent compared to the pre-war year of 1940. In reality, the industrial output in 1950 was 73 percent higher than in 1940. The Soviet industrial part of the Five-Year Plan was completed ahead of schedule in four years and three months.

    Based on the adoption of the latest modern technological achievements, a further improvement of the technical level of all sectors of our industry has been ensured. The construction of the largest hydroelectric power stations and canals on the Volga and Dnieper Rivers, and on the Don and Amu Rivers, is a clear sign of the growing productive technological strength of socialist industry and the prosperity of Soviet science and technology. The newborn baby of the great communist construction—the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal—has already opened to navigation.

    Our Party is gradually implementing the policy of first developing the leading heavy industry sectors, which are the foundation for the continuous upsurge of the socialist economy.

    Comrade Stalin said in his speech on the economic situation and the Party's policy in 1926: "...We should push forward our industry as the foundation of socialism and as the leading force to lead the entire national economy forward."

    In the draft directives of the 19th Congress of the Party regarding the Fifth Five-Year Plan, a further powerful upsurge of the Soviet national economy is determined, and in particular, the high speed of development of the basic sectors of heavy industry is stipulated. It is determined that the level of industrial production will increase by approximately 70 percent during the five-year period, with an average annual increase of approximately 12 percent in total industrial output. It is stipulated that the rate of increase in the production of the means of production will be 13 percent, and the rate of increase in the production of consumer goods will be 11 percent.

    The Soviet people have accepted with great satisfaction the tasks announced in the draft directives of the 19th Congress of the Party, which stipulate the high speed of production growth in ferrous and non-ferrous metals, coal and oil, electricity, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry, timber industry, and construction industry, and stipulate the further upsurge of railways and other various modes of transportation. In the new Five-Year Plan, it is stipulated that the increase in output in 1955 compared to 1950 will be as follows: pig iron increased by 76 percent, steel by 62 percent, rolled metal by 64 percent, coal by 43 percent, petroleum by 85 percent, and electricity by 80 percent. The high speed of development of the machine manufacturing industry, which is the foundation for new and powerful technological progress in all sectors of the Soviet national economy, has also been stipulated.

    The Fifth Five-Year Plan opens up greater development prospects for construction work, and the construction of huge hydroelectric power stations has gained vast scale. During these five years, it is stipulated that many huge hydroelectric power stations will begin to transmit electricity, including the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station with a generating capacity of 2.1 million kilowatts, as well as the Kama, Gorky, Mingechaur, Ust-Kamenogorskaya, and other hydroelectric power stations with a total generating capacity of 1.916 million kilowatts; the construction of the Stalingrad and Kakhovka Hydroelectric Stations will be expanded, and the construction of some new huge hydroelectric power stations will begin: the Cheboksary Hydroelectric Station on the Volga River, the Votkinsk Hydroelectric Station on the Kama River, the Bukhtarma Hydroelectric Station on the Irtysh River, etc., and the development of the power resources of the Angara River will begin.

    In the draft directives of the 19th Congress of the Party regarding the Fifth Five-Year Plan, very important tasks are put forward to all our Party organizations and economic organizations. These tasks are to mobilize the internal resources of the economy in order to further increase socialist accumulation, strictly observe state discipline, and ensure that each enterprise fulfills its share of the production plan. In the Five-Year Plan, improving the quality indicators of enterprise work is of particular significance.

    On the basis of the continuous improvement of mass initiative and the surge of the nationwide socialist competition, it is necessary to achieve further improvement in labor productivity and reduction in production costs, and also to more widely develop the movement of inventors and rationalization proposers, production advanced workers and innovators, and to continuously consolidate the creative cooperation between scientific activists and production workers.

    In order to successfully complete the Fifth Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to improve the leadership of economic organs over the activities of all enterprises, extensively launch criticism of the shortcomings in our organizational work, so as to be able to eliminate these shortcomings most quickly.

    The draft directives of the 19th Congress of the Party states: "It is necessary to guide the great strength of socialist competition, the common efforts of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals in safeguarding the cause of peace, and the unwavering determination of the working people to build a communist society in the direction of striving to complete and over-fulfill the new Five-Year Plan." In order to celebrate the 19th Congress of the Party, socialist competition is now being launched more and more widely in enterprises throughout the country, following the example of all the personnel of the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow. The Soviet people are preparing to commemorate the congress with new production victories.

    The Fifth Five-Year Plan determines the new and powerful upsurge of the Soviet national economy, and guarantees the further significant improvement of the people's material well-being and cultural level. Our working people will take a big step forward along the road of development from socialism to communism by successfully completing the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

    工业的强有力的高涨
    ——苏联真理报八月二十九日社论
    苏联各族人民以巨大的爱国主义的高涨迎接联共（布）第十九次代表大会。庆祝代表大会的社会主义竞赛正在增长和扩展着。
    数以百万计的苏联人对行将来到的列宁—斯大林党的代表大会表现出深厚的兴趣，深刻地研究在报纸上公布的联共（布）中央委员会的文件。劳动人民有权以我们祖国在争取共产主义斗争中所达到的伟大胜利而自豪。
    斯大林同志在一九四六年二月九日的选民大会上的历史性的演说中，规定了共产党在最近期间和更长期间内的工作计划。斯大林同志说过：“至于说到更长一个时期的计划，那末党是立意要造成国民经济强大的新高涨，使我们能够——譬如说——把我国工业水准提高到超过战前水准达三倍。我们必须使我国工业能每年出产生铁达五千万吨，钢达六千万吨，煤炭达五万万吨，煤油达六千万吨。只有做到了这步时，才可以说，我们祖国已有了免除一切意外的保障。这大概是需要三个新五年计划的时间，——也许还要多些，——才可做到。但这是可能做到，而且是我们所应当做到的。”
    苏联人民实现着共产主义建设的计划，成功地完成了战后五年计划，沿着共产主义的道路向前迈进了新的一大步。
    我们社会主义的工业是以空前的高速度发展着。第四个五年计划曾决定了：一九五○年的苏联全部工业产量——五年计划的最后一年——与战前一九四○年相比应增加百分之四十八。实际上，一九五○年的工业产量比一九四○年多百分之七十三。五年计划中的苏联工业部分以四年零三个月而提前完成。
    在采用最新的现代技术成就的基础上，保证了我们工业各部门技术水平的进一步提高。在伏尔加河与第聂泊河，在顿河与阿姆河上的最大的水电站和运河的建设，是社会主义工业增长着的生产技术的实力和苏联科学与技术繁荣的鲜明标志。伟大的共产主义建筑的初生儿——列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河——已经开航了。
    我党逐步地实现着首先发展主导的重工业各部门的政策，重工业就是社会主义经济不断高涨的基础。
    斯大林同志还在一九二六年的关于经济情况和党的政策的演说中说过：“……我们应该向前推进我国的工业，做为社会主义的基础和做为领导整个国民经济前进的领导力量。”
    在党的第十九次代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示草案中，确定了苏联国民经济进一步强有力的高涨，并特别规定了重工业基本部门发展的高速度。确定了五年期间工业生产水平提高约百分之七十，工业总产量每年平均约增加百分之十二。规定生产资料产量的增加率为百分之十三，消费资料产量的增加率为百分之十一。
    苏联人民非常满意地接受党的第十九次代表大会的指示草案中所公布的任务，这些任务规定黑色金属和有色金属、煤和石油、电力、机器制造、化学工业、木材工业、建筑工业的生产增长的高速度，规定铁路和其他各种运输的进一步高涨。在新的五年计划中，规定一九五五年产量与一九五零年相比，增加的比例如下：铣铁增加百分之七十六、钢百分之六十二、压延金属百分之六十四、煤百分之四十三、石油百分之八十五、电力百分之八十。也规定了机器制造业发展的高速度，机器制造业就是苏联国民经济各部门中新的强大的技术进步的基础。
    第五个五年计划开辟了建筑工作更大的发展远景，巨大的水电站建筑获得广大的规模。在这五年中，规定使许多巨大的水电站开始送电，其中包括发电能力为二百一十万瓩的古比雪夫水电站以及总共发电能力为一百九十一万六千瓩的卡马、高尔基、明基卡乌尔、乌斯特—卡曼诺戈尔斯卡亚及其他水电站；展开斯大林格勒和卡霍夫卡水电站的建造工作，并开始建筑一些新的巨大的水电站：伏尔加河上的契鲍克萨利水电站，卡马河上的沃特金斯克水电站，伊尔提斯河上的布克塔马水电站等等，开始进行开发安加拉河的动力资源工作。
    在党的第十九次代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示草案中，给我们一切党组织和经济组织提出非常重大的任务。这些任务就是动员经济内在资源，以便进一步提高社会主义的积蓄，做到严格遵守国家纪律和每个企业必须完成其分内的生产计划。在五年计划中，提高企业工作的质量指标是具有特殊意义的。
    在群众的创议不断提高和全民社会主义竞赛高涨的基础上，必须达到劳动生产率的进一步提高和生产成本的降低，还要更广泛地展开发明家和合理化建议者、生产先进者和革新者的运动，并不断地巩固科学活动家和生产工作者的创造性的合作。
    为了成功地完成第五个五年计划，必须改善经济机关对一切企业活动的领导，广泛展开对我们组织工作中缺点的批评，以便能最迅速地铲除这些缺点。
    党的第十九次代表大会的指示草案中说：“必须把社会主义竞赛的伟大力量，工人、集体农民和知识分子维护和平事业的共同努力，劳动人民建设共产主义社会的不可动摇的决心引到为完成和超额完成新五年计划而斗争的方向。”为了庆祝党的第十九次代表大会，现在仿效着莫斯科的斯大林汽车工厂的全体人员的范例，在国内各企业中愈益广泛地展开了社会主义竞赛。苏联人准备以新的生产胜利来纪念代表大会。
    第五个五年计划确定了苏联国民经济的新的有力的高涨，并保证人民的物质幸福和文化水平的进一步显著的提高。我国的劳动人民将以成功地完成第五个五年计划来沿着社会主义到共产主义发展的道路向前迈进一大步。
