    Before we leave the capital of the great People's Republic of China—the hospitable Beijing—I would like to express, on behalf of our government delegation, our sincere gratitude to the great Chinese people, the government of the People's Republic of China, and Comrade Mao Zedong for their warm reception and kind attention.

    The economic and cultural cooperation agreement signed between the governments of the Mongolian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China, which aims to enhance the happiness of our two peoples, is a valuable contribution to the cause of consolidating peace in the Far East.

    The Mongolian people welcome the conclusion of this agreement with great joy.

    The friendship between our two peoples is solid and unbreakable. No force can shake this friendship.

    Our delegation participated in the grand celebration of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This great festival is a vivid expression of the ever-increasing power of the Chinese people and a proof of the ever-stronger friendship and unity of all nationalities in China.

    We have visited many places in China and have seen many outstanding achievements of the Chinese people. Everywhere we have received extremely friendly and sincere receptions full of warmth and sincerity.

    The Chinese people have achieved great victories in all aspects of the construction of the new People's Democratic China. These victories of the great Chinese people are victories for the entire democratic camp. The glorious achievements won by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong make the Mongolian people feel heartfelt joy.

    The people of Mongolia and China, like all peace-loving people in the world, are inextricably linked to the cause of maintaining and consolidating peace.

    Long live world peace!

    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese people!

    Long live the friendship between China, Mongolia, the Soviet Union, and the people of all People's Democratic countries!

    Long live Comrade Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and a sincere friend of the Mongolian people!

    Glory to Comrade Marshal Stalin, the leader of the people of all countries, the greatest standard-bearer of the cause of peace, our people's beloved friend and wise mentor!
