    A Look at the Changes in Workers' Lives Over the Past Three Years From One Family
    Comrade Editor: I recently investigated the life of a worker's family, and I think it is necessary to introduce it to the general readership. The changes in workers' lives over the past three years are a matter of concern to the broad masses of the people. The family life of Sun Yugui, an old repair worker at the Beijing Tram Repair Factory, can represent the changes in the lives of ordinary workers.
    Although Old Sun is sixty-six years old, his face is dark and plump, and his shoulders are broad and thick. He looks even stronger and younger than when I first met him last year. A few days ago, he just returned from the Beidaihe Workers' Sanatorium of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions. His son, Sun Guangli, who pretended to be "fifteen years old" to deceive the Japanese into working in the factory at the age of thirteen because he couldn't stand the hunger, was promoted to cadre after the "Three-Anti" Movement and is responsible for the factory's material purchasing. The family also has a new granddaughter this year. Their whole family is living this beautiful life with smiles on their faces and joy in their hearts.
    Old Sun's family is not very large: he, his wife, his son, his daughter-in-law, and two granddaughters. The six of them live in four north-facing rooms. Although the house is a bit old, it is kept very clean. Next to the kitchen, a high pile of briquettes is neatly framed with wooden boards. The furnishings in the house are really complete: a large wardrobe with a glass mirror makes the whole room bright. There is also a glass top on the desk. Not only are there electric lights, a clock, and a radio, but even an electric fan has been purchased. Before I could sit down, Sun Guangli pointed to a portrait of Chairman Mao and said to me: "This was bought when Beijing was just liberated. Since we had this portrait, the house has changed. These things were all newly bought after liberation, only the two kang and the two old kang mats under the mattresses are from before liberation. Such a life was unimaginable in the past!" Yes, the changes in the past three years have been really great!
    To make me more aware of the changes in their lives, Sun Guangli also calculated in detail their income and expenditure accounts before and after liberation. Now the total wage of him and his father is more than one million yuan. In addition, there are technical bonuses every quarter, and the old man can also receive 20% of his salary as labor insurance money every month. If calculated in kind, their current monthly income is enough to buy fifteen bags of white flour. What about before liberation? Even if the two of them worked desperately for a month, they couldn't earn even one and a half bags of flour. That is to say, their current life is more than ten times better than before liberation. As soon as the topic touched on the "past," the complaints came pouring out.
    At that time, Old Sun toiled like an animal in the factory during the day, and his monthly salary was only enough for the family's coal bill. After work, he would hurriedly put a flour sack in his waist and pedal a rickshaw. After struggling until the second half of the night, he finally earned a few drops of blood and sweat money, and then rushed to the entrance of the rice shop to wait in line to buy flour. Shivering under the north wind until after eight o'clock the next morning, it was finally his turn to get two jin of "Republican flour." Even suffering like this, half a day's living was still unsettled. At that time, the old woman also suffered a lot. She picked up waste paper during the day, and had to get up before it was even dark to pick up coal cinders. Poor people have many disasters. In the year before liberation, when she was picking up coal cinders, she was hit on the head by a piece of wood that fell from the roof. In order to treat her illness, the family sold the only quilt with tears in their eyes. In the coldest days of winter, only bare kang mats were left on the kang. What a life that was!
    Now life has turned upside down. While Guangli and I were talking enthusiastically, the old man came back from work. As soon as he entered the door, the meal was already prepared. Large and small bowls of fragrant food were spread all over the table. After eating and drinking some tea, he turned on the radio and, while listening to Beijing opera, said to me: "The life of the workers is getting better day by day. I don't know what it will be like in a communist society..." To increase production to celebrate the National Day, the old man also has to go to the factory at night to work overtime. His daughter-in-law has already prepared eggs and noodles, and when he comes back, he will have another supper. Guangli's mother is now living a very leisurely and comfortable life, taking care of her granddaughter and helping with some housework. Whatever she wants to wear, she always gets it. A few days ago, she clamored to buy another fur coat, and her son prepared hundreds of thousands of yuan for her. Listening to the radio introduce the situation of the materials exchange conference, she happily said: "Guangli! Next Sunday, you ride your bicycle and I'll sit in the rickshaw, let's go to the Temple of Heaven 'Materials Exchange Conference' to see the goods." In addition to eating their fill and dressing warmly, this family now also has money left over every month to buy "prize-winning savings."
    To understand the changes in this family's life, it is not enough to look at just eating, clothing, and housing. More importantly, it is the changes in their thoughts and emotions. The fastest progress in his family has been made by the young worker Sun Guangli, who is only twenty-one years old this year but already has nine years of seniority. He is a Communist Party member. After liberation, under the direct education of the Party, he actively produces, studies hard, and enthusiastically does social work. He also works as a political teacher at the Seventh District Adult Night School. When the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea began, he worked hard to do street propaganda work. The red satin banner hanging on the wall of the house is proof of his work achievements. After the "Three-Anti" Movement, he was promoted to purchasing agent. Because he studies his profession and strives to overcome difficulties, although the time is short, he has initially found the "trick." In July alone, he saved more than 20 million yuan for the country. This apprentice who threw down his schoolbag at the age of thirteen now has a considerable level of political and cultural knowledge. I counted the books on his desk, a total of ninety-eight large and small, including "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Historical Materialism," and "Industrial Statistics Tutorial." "Can you understand them?" I asked with a smile. Yes, reading these books is not without difficulties for him. He took out the notes he wrote in 1950 when he was studying at the cadre training class of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. The handwriting was crooked and uneven, written with gritted teeth. Comparing it with the current notes, he breathed a sigh of relief and said: "Difficulties can be overcome." Now, what encourages him is, "After five or ten years of economic construction, I don't know how our factory will develop? Maybe we will be producing trolleybuses at that time. How can we not study hard!"
    Compared with the time when he was just liberated, Old Sun's mind has also made much progress. The Communist Party has brought him warmth and happiness. Needless to say, he is deeply moved. He is also willing to work hard to strike a few more hammers to thank Chairman Mao. But when it comes to "struggling for communism," he is not enthusiastic. He once thought: "I am in my sixties, and communism has nothing to do with me anyway." He also considered: "Just muddle along for a few more years. As long as Guangli can support this family, I, the old man, will go home and rest." Last year, the Labor Insurance Regulations were promulgated, and this year he went to Beidaihe for recuperation. These living facts dispelled his negative thoughts. He firmly stated: "Although communism has nothing to do with me, our sons and grandsons have a share. Work! I have to work even if I die!" He and his partners in the repair class actively tapped potential and have reduced the failure rate from 5% to 2.5%. In order to welcome the National Day, he proposed to reduce it further to 0.5%. He is also working hard to study political theory, preparing to strive for membership in the Party.
    The old woman and the daughter-in-law are also making progress day by day. When Beijing was just liberated, when Sun Guangli hung the portrait of Chairman Mao at home, his mother was still worried, "What will happen if that faction comes back in the future?" Now she tells me in person: "It's right to follow the Communist Party!" The god tablet that had been enshrined in the house for so many years was also thrown into the pile of rubbish by her. Guangli's lover is working hard to study culture. She always asks Guangli to find some work for her to do all day long. She said: "As long as I can serve the people, I don't need a salary, I don't even need food." Under her influence, her four-year-old baby is now also clamoring to "serve the people when he grows up."

### 从一个家庭看三年来工人生活的变化

    从一个家庭看三年来工人生活的变化
    编辑同志：我最近调查一个工人家庭的生活，我认为有必要向广大读者介绍一下。三年来工人生活的变化情况是广大人民所关心的。北京市电车修造厂的老检修工人孙玉贵的家庭生活就可以代表一般工人生活变化的情况。
    孙老头虽说是六十六岁的人，但脸孔又黑又胖，肩膀又宽又厚，比较去年我第一次和他见面时更显得壮健而年轻了。前些日子，他刚从北京市总工会北戴河工人休养所休养回来。他的儿子——那个十三岁时挨不起饿就冒充“十五岁”蒙着日本人到厂里当学徒工的孙广利，“三反”运动以后被提升为干部，负责全厂购料工作。家里今年又添了个小孙女。他们一家子正脸笑心开花地过着这美好的日子。
    孙老头家里人口不算多：他、他老伴、儿子、儿媳妇和两个小孙女。老小六口人住了四间北房。房子虽说旧一点，但收拾得挺干净，紧靠厨房处，高高的一堆煤球也用木板整整齐齐地框起来。屋子里的陈设真是齐全：嵌着玻璃镜子的大衣柜，照得整间屋子亮晃晃的，书桌子上还有玻璃板，不仅有电灯、钟、电匣子（收音机），连电风扇也置上啦。没有等我坐下来，孙广利便指着一幅毛主席挂像对我说：“这是北京刚解放时买来的。自从有了这幅像，屋里就变了样。这些东西都是解放后新置的，只有两个火炕和褥子下面的两张旧炕席是解放以前的。现在这样的生活，在过去连做梦也不敢想啊！”是的，三年多来的变化可真大啊！
    为了使我更明了他们生活变化的情形，孙广利又给算了一下解放前后他们收入支出的细账。现在他们爷儿俩的工资一共是一百二十多万，另外，每季还有技术奖励，老头每月还可以拿工资百分之二十的劳动保险金。如果拿实物来计算，现在每月的收入足足可买十五袋白面；而解放以前呢？尽管他们爷儿俩一个月拚死拚活的干，还挣不上一袋半面。就是说：他们现在的生活，要比解放前提高十好几倍了。话题一接触到“过去”，苦水可就倒个没完。
    那时候，孙老头白天在厂里牛马般卖命，一个月的工资只够家里的煤火费，下班后便慌慌张张地腰里揣个面口袋蹬三轮去。挨到下半宵，好容易挣到几个血汗钱，就赶紧跑到米店门口排队等买面。在北风底下抖栗到第二天八点多钟，才轮到二斤“共和面”。就是这样受，一天的生活也还有半天没着落。那时候，老婆子受的罪也不轻。她大白天拾烂纸，天还黑糊糊就得起身去捡煤核。穷人就是灾难多，临解放那年，她捡煤核时，给天棚上面掉下来的木块把头砸了个大窟窿。为了给她治病，一家人噙着眼泪把仅有的一床被窝卖了。腊月三九天，炕上就剩了光炕席，那是什么日子啊！
    现在的生活可就翻了个跟斗。我和广利正谈得起劲的时候，老头下班回来了。一进门饭已经做得了，大碗小碗香喷喷的摆满一桌子，吃过饭喝点茶，他扭开电匣子，一边听京戏，一边向我说：“工人的生活真是一天比一天好，说不准到共产主义社会是个啥样子……”为了增产迎接国庆，老头在晚上还得到厂里去赶点夜活，他儿媳妇早就把鸡子、挂面准备好了，等他回来时再吃一顿夜餐，广利他妈现在生活得也很轻闲自在，带带小孙女，帮着做点家务活。要什么穿的戴的，总是十开口九行。前些日子她就嚷着要再置件皮袄，他儿子就给她准备好了几十万元钱。老婆子听着电匣子里在介绍物资交流大会的情况，她就高兴地说：“广利！赶明儿星期天，你骑自行车，我坐三轮，咱们到天坛‘物资交流会’上看看货色去。”这个家庭现在除了吃饱穿暖，每月还有剩余钱买“有奖储蓄”。
    要了解这家人生活变化的情形，光是从吃、穿、住这些方面来看还是不够的，更重要的是他们思想情绪上的变化。他家进步最快的是这个今年才二十一岁便已经有了九年工龄的青年工人孙广利。他是个共产党员，解放以后在党的直接教育下，积极生产，努力学习，热心做社会工作。他兼前七区成人夜校的政治教员，抗美援朝开始时，他努力做街道的宣传工作，屋里壁上挂的那面红缎锦旗，便是他的工作成绩的证明。“三反”运动以后，他被提升做采购员。由于他钻研业务，努力克服困难，时间虽短，但已初步摸到了“窍门”，仅七月份就给国家节省了二千多万元。这个十三岁就扔下书包的学徒工，现在已经具有相当的政治文化水平。我数一下他桌上的书，大大小小共九十八本，其中有“毛泽东选集”、“历史唯物论”和“工业统计学教程”。“啃得动吗？”我笑着问。是的，阅读这些书对于他不是没有困难的。他搬出一九五○年在中共北京市委干部训练班学习时，一笔一划咬着牙写下来字迹歪歪扭扭的笔记，和现在的笔记比较起来，他舒了一口气说：“困难是可以战胜的。”现在，鼓舞着他的是“经过五年、十年的经济建设，我们厂不晓得发展得怎么样？也许那时要生产无轨电车了。咱不抓紧学习那里行啊！”
    孙老头比起刚解放时脑筋也进步得多了。共产党给他带来了温暖和幸福，不消说他是深受感动的。他也愿意使劲多打几个鎯头来答谢毛主席。但是说到“为共产主义奋斗”他可就不热心了。他曾经想：“六十几的人啦，共产主义反正没有我的份儿”，他也曾经盘算过：“再凑合干几年，只要广利能顶这个家，我老头便回家歇歇了。”前年公布了劳动保险条例，今年他又去北戴河休养，这些活的事实打消了他的消极思想，他坚决地表示：“共产主义虽然没我的份，但是我们的儿子孙子有份。干！死也得干！”他和检修班的伙伴积极挖掘潜力，已经把坏车率从百分之五降低到百分之二点五，为了迎接国庆，他又提出了再降低到百分之零点五。他还在努力学习政治理论，准备争取入党。
    老婆子和儿媳妇也一天天在进步。北京刚解放，孙广利把毛主席的像往家里挂时，他妈还耽心“将来那一派回来怎么办？”现在她亲口对我说：“跟着共产党走没错！”在屋里供了多少年的神牌，这下子也给她扔到破烂堆里去了。广利的爱人正在努力学习文化。她一天到晚总是要求广利给找点工作做。她说：“只要能为人民服务，不挣一个工资分，不管饭也行。”在她的影响下，她那四周岁的小娃娃，现在也嚷着“长大要为人民服务”了。　柳梆
