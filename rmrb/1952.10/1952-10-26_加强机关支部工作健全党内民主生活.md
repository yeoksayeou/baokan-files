    Strengthening the Work of Party Branches in Government Organs and Improving Inner-Party Democratic Life

    I

    The important role of the great "Three-Anti" Movement in our Party building is now even clearer. First, the "Three-Anti" Movement, for our Party, was the most practical and effective Party rectification movement and a mass discipline inspection movement. Through this movement, a group of embezzlers were exposed and dealt with, and some degenerate, incorrigible elements and class alien elements were removed, thus purifying the Party organization and improving the quality of the Party. Second, this movement was the most profound and practical ideological remolding movement. The vast majority of Party members, based on the eight conditions for a Communist Party member, liquidated and criticized the influence of bourgeois ideology and work style and other errors, drew a clear line between the ideology of the working class and the bourgeoisie, clarified and strengthened the direction of future struggles, and improved the ideological level and awareness of Party members. Third, for our government organs, this movement was also a mass and thorough democratic reform movement. In this movement, bureaucracy and undemocratic work styles were severely criticized. Unreasonable phenomena and loopholes in the system have also been basically corrected, which has strengthened the masses' supervision of leaders. As a result, in many government organs, a new atmosphere has emerged, the political atmosphere and learning atmosphere are stronger, work efficiency has improved, and the relationship between superiors and subordinates, Party members and the masses has become closer.

    The "Three-Anti" Movement educated and tempered our Party members, tested our Party organization, and also proved that the majority of our Party members have stood firm on their class stand, maintained the Party's fine traditions, maintained close ties with the masses, and resolutely implemented the Party's policies. But at the same time, this movement also exposed some problems existing within our Party. Even in some areas and some departments, there were some serious problems, mainly: First, inner-Party democratic life was abnormal, the democratic system was unsound, and criticism and self-criticism were not carried out. Many leading cadres have not participated in organizational life for a long time, intentionally or unintentionally treating themselves as "special Party members." Some Party committees do not convene Party congresses and representative meetings, do not regularly report their work to Party members, earnestly listen to the opinions of Party members and the masses, promptly discover shortcomings, carry out criticism, and study and improve their work. As a result, government organs lack a political atmosphere, which breeds liberalism, allows evil to rise, and loosens discipline. Even some Party members and cadres shield each other, deceive their superiors and subordinates, act like tyrants, or suspect each other, engage in unprincipled disputes, and remain disunited for a long time. Second, many local Party committees do not pay attention to the work of Party branches in government organs; many administrative responsible Party members do not participate in the Party's leadership in government organs and do not care about the work of Party branches; and many Party members are unwilling to do the work of Party branches in government organs, believing that they have no power, it is too trivial, too troublesome, and an "extra burden." This has resulted in many Party branches in government organs lacking political and ideological leadership, lacking combat effectiveness, and unable to play the role of a core fortress of the branch. As a result, many Party members lack due vigilance against the erosion of bourgeois ideology, and phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy have emerged. There are even individual elements who have lost the Party's stand, degenerated, and become traitors to the Party and criminals of the country.

    After the "Three-Anti" Movement, many local Party committees generally paid attention to the work of Party branches in government organs, convened Party congresses or representative meetings of government organs, carried out self-criticism and bottom-up criticism, strengthened democratic life within the Party, and established and improved various systems in government organs. But it cannot be assumed that after the "Three-Anti" Movement, the erosion of bourgeois ideology on our Party will end, the illegal and disciplinary violations and corrupt behavior of cadres will be eradicated, and the erroneous thinking of Party members will not occur. Facts have proved that at present, there are still many Party committees that do not understand the importance of the work of Party branches in government organs, do not pay attention to the Party's work in government organs, do not pay attention to the democratic system and democratic life in government organs, do not conduct in-depth inspections of what problems exist in government organs, or do not actively and proactively solve them after discovering problems. Even the erroneous ideological work style of some Party member cadres has not been thoroughly liquidated in the "Three-Anti" Movement, and those who made mistakes have not received due education. After the "Three-Anti" Movement, old habits recur. Recently, Kang Jinxi, a business accountant of the Zhangjiakou City Third District Cooperative, and Zhang Wenxiang, a clerk in the Tuan Municipal Committee, were warned for corruption in the "Three-Anti" Movement, and after the "Three-Anti" Movement, they were expelled from the Party for corruption. We must strengthen the work of Party branches in government organs and improve inner-Party democratic life on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" Movement in order to consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" Movement and continuously improve the Party's combat effectiveness.

    II

    In order to do a good job in the Party's work in government organs, it is necessary to clearly recognize the importance of the work of Party branches in government organs. At present, there are hundreds of thousands of Party members in tens of thousands of Party branches in government organs across the country, including hundreds of thousands of cadres, who are the leading backbone of the revolution and the commanders of national construction. The great victory of the revolution in the past was inseparable from their heroic struggle and hard work; in the future, to consolidate the achievements of the revolution and successfully complete the great economic construction and cultural construction tasks, it is necessary to continue to cultivate them, improve them, and make them qualified leading cadres at all levels. One of the important methods to cultivate and improve them is to strengthen the work of Party branches in government organs and strengthen democratic life within the Party. Because the work of the branch is the Party's political work, organizational work, cadre work, and mass work, only by improving the work of Party branches and branch life in government organs can we strengthen the communist education of Party members and non-Party members, strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses, consolidate the Party's organization, strengthen the political atmosphere, improve work efficiency, and ensure the completion of administrative tasks. Therefore, every Communist Party member should participate in and care about the work of Party branches in government organs, especially administrative responsible cadres, who should regularly guide and assist the Party's work in government organs and oppose the phenomenon of being unwilling to do branch work under the pretext of being busy. We should emphasize that every Party member with a social occupation, in addition to engaging in social occupation, must undertake a job under the distribution of a Party organization. Otherwise, he cannot be a Communist Party member.

    In order to do a good job in the Party's work in government organs, it is necessary to clearly stipulate the tasks of Party branches in government organs. According to the experience of the Work Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Party branches in government organs generally have six specific tasks: to lead and organize all personnel of the government organ to carry out learning—including the study of Marxism-Leninism and culture, business, current events, and policies; to carry out Party affairs work; to assist the administrative system in carrying out various tasks related to the life and welfare of staff members; to assign Party members to carry out propaganda, organization, and other social service work among the masses inside and outside the government organ; to assist the administrative system in carrying out and inspecting confidentiality work and security work; and to lead the work of the Youth League in the government organ.

    In order to do a good job in the six specific tasks of Party branches in government organs, it is necessary to improve and enrich the institutions of the direct government organs Party committees and select a group of loyal, reliable, upright in style, and of excellent quality Party member cadres to undertake this work. The general branches or branches of government organs with a large number of Party members should also be equipped with full-time cadres as appropriate to strengthen the leadership of daily work. It is necessary to re-elect and replace those branch secretaries or branch committee members who are not competent and do not actively do Party work and select outstanding Party members in the government organs who maintain close ties with the masses to take on branch work.

    At the same time, it is also necessary to establish and improve various systems for the work of Party branches in government organs, including meeting systems, inspection systems, and learning and living systems, etc. Branch committee members should clearly divide their work and should not hold too many concurrent positions. The branch or general branch should organize the personnel in the government organ into various social activities in a planned way and pay attention to ensuring that every Party member can do Party work. For responsible cadres who are busy with work, they can be designated to make special reports, and Party members with lower levels can also be assigned to do certain work. In this way, the enthusiasm of all Party members can be fully brought into play, so that they can be tempered and improved in their work, and the work of the branch and the life of the government organ can be enlivened. In addition, Party committees at all levels must strengthen the leadership of the work of Party branches in government organs, regularly study the various work and systems of Party branches in government organs, as well as the activity methods and methods of branches in government organs, and regularly inspect, summarize, and promote experience in order to do a good job in the Party's work in government organs.

    III

    To improve inner-Party democratic life, strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership, and regularly carry out self-criticism and bottom-up criticism. Every Communist Party member should participate in organizational life without exception and should regularly use the method of criticism and self-criticism to review their mistakes and shortcomings in their work and correct them in a timely manner. Whoever has a serious mistake that cannot be corrected, and is proud of his achievements, arrogant and self-important, and insists on mistakes, cannot be a Communist Party member. But some Party members and Party organizations, when they discover that Party member cadres have violated Party discipline, do not raise the issue to a principled level in a positive and timely manner to criticize and correct it, but instead take a roundabout and perfunctory approach, or are afraid of hurting feelings and start from taking care of emotions, attempting to compromise with each other and live in peace. As a result, Party discipline is relaxed, and various errors within the Party develop further. Some Party organizations rarely criticize and expose the errors of a Party member that are still in their infancy. Usually, only when a Party member's errors have developed to a serious degree, they have to carry out criticism and struggle, which results in a Party member who could have been saved developing to the point of being beyond redemption. Facts have proved that in places where inner-Party democratic life is normal and criticism and self-criticism are carried out, there are fewer phenomena of illegal and disciplinary violations within the Party, and even if there are, they are quickly exposed and corrected. On the contrary, there are more errors, and they are not easily discovered and overcome. Therefore, it is necessary to establish and improve various systems in government organs, including democratic systems, financial systems, personnel systems, work, life, and learning systems, etc. The key to improving various systems lies in improving the inner-Party democratic system. First, Party congresses and representative meetings of government organ Party members should be held regularly, and the Party committee should report its work to the congress or representative meeting, summarize experiences, accept the review and criticism of the congress, put forward future work tasks, make resolutions, and elect members of the Party committee at the Party congress. Second, the general branch committee or branch committee of the government organ should be re-elected regularly and Party member meetings should be held regularly. All major issues concerning all Party members and the work plan and work summary of the branch must be discussed and decided by the general branch or branch Party member meeting. In the work that needs to be carried out universally or can be carried out uniformly in the government organ Party branch, the general branch or branch should convene a Party member meeting to convey and arrange it uniformly and centrally. Prepare fully before the meeting, the content of the meeting should be concise and to the point, with a focus, and recreational activities can be carried out after the meeting as appropriate to enliven government organ life. Third, all Party member cadres should live a strict organizational life and regularly and correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism, and develop a humble and democratic work style. Fourth, economic departments and educational institutions should establish a political work system and add deputy positions for political work in a timely manner, and closely combine political work and Party work in government organs, enterprises, and schools. In this way, the political and ideological leadership of state staff can be strengthened, preventing both the tendency to ignore politics and the tendency to deviate from business. Fifth, convene representative meetings and group meetings of government organ staff and the annual democratic meeting that is coordinated with the year-end summary work, fully promote democracy, carry out bottom-up criticism, inspect and summarize work, so that various erroneous ideas among government organ personnel can be discovered and overcome in a timely manner, and the political awareness of Party members and the masses can be improved, and the bureaucracy of leading cadres can also be overcome. As Lenin said, "We must use greater perseverance to mobilize millions of workers and peasants to criticize from below and supervise from below. This is the main antidote to bureaucracy." In this way, "it is necessary to develop proletarian democracy in all mass organizations of the working class, and first of all within the Party itself. Without this condition, self-criticism is equal to zero, an empty shell, an empty phrase." (See Stalin's "Against the Vulgarization of the Slogan of Self-Criticism")

    加强机关支部工作健全党内民主生活
    一
    伟大的“三反”运动在我们党的建设上的重要作用，现在更看得十分清楚了。首先，“三反”运动对于我们党来说，是一次最实际最有效的整党运动和群众性的纪律大检查运动。经过这一运动揭发和处理了一批贪污分子，清除了一些蜕化变质、不可救药的分子和阶级异己分子，因而纯洁了党的组织，提高了党的质量。其次，这个运动是一个最深刻最实际的思想改造运动。广大党员都根据共产党员标准的八项条件，清算和批判了资产阶级的思想作风的影响及其他错误，划清了工人阶级和资产阶级的思想界限，明确与坚定了今后斗争的方向，提高了党员的思想水平和觉悟程度。第三，对于我们的机关来讲，这个运动又是一次群众性的彻底的民主改革运动。在这个运动中，官僚主义和不民主的作风受到了严厉的批判。制度上的不合理现象和漏洞，也基本上被纠正了，这就加强了群众对领导者的监督作用。因而在很多机关中，新气象出现了，政治空气和学习空气更浓厚了，工作效率提高了，上级与下级、党员与群众的关系更加密切了。
    “三反”运动教育和锻炼了我们的党员，考验了我们党的组织，也证明了我们大多数党员是站稳了阶级立场，保持了党的优良作风，密切联系群众，坚决执行党的政策的。但同时这一运动也暴露出我们党内存在着一些问题。甚至在某些地区某些部门存在着一些严重问题，主要是：第一，党内民主生活不正常，民主制度不健全，批评与自我批评不开展。不少领导干部，长期不过组织生活，有意无意地把自己当作“特殊党员”。有些党的委员会，不召开党的代表大会和代表会议，没有定期地向党员报告工作，认真地听取党员和群众的意见，及时地发现缺点，开展批评，研究与改进工作。结果机关中缺乏政治空气，滋长了自由主义，邪气上升，纪律松弛。甚至有些党员干部互相包庇，瞒上欺下，作威作福，或相互猜忌，闹无原则纠纷，长期不团结。第二，许多地区的党委不重视机关支部工作；许多行政负责党员不参与机关党的领导，不关心支部工作；还有很多党员不愿作机关支部工作，认为没有权力，太琐碎，太麻烦，是“额外负担”。这样就使许多机关支部缺乏政治思想领导，缺乏战斗力，不能发挥支部的核心堡垒作用。因之，不少党员对资产阶级思想的侵蚀缺乏应有的警惕，产生了贪污、浪费和官僚主义的现象，甚至还有个别分子，竟丧失党的立场，蜕化变质，成了党的叛徒，国家的罪人。
    经过“三反”运动，许多地区的党委，一般地重视了机关支部工作，召开了机关党的代表大会或代表会议，开展了自我批评和自下而上的批评，加强了党内的民主生活，建立和健全了机关中的各种制度。但不能认为经过“三反”运动，资产阶级思想对我党的侵蚀就此终止，干部中违法乱纪、贪污腐化行为也就此根绝，党员中的错误思想就不会产生。事实证明，目前仍有不少党委不了解机关支部工作的重要性，不重视机关党的工作，不注意机关中的民主制度和民主生活，不深入检查机关中存在着什么问题，或发现问题后不积极主动地加以解决。甚至有些党员干部的错误的思想作风，在“三反”中并未受到彻底清算，犯错误者没有得到应有的教育，“三反”过后，旧病复发。最近张家口市三区合作社业务会计康进喜和团市委收发张文祥就是在“三反”中因贪污受到警告处分，“三反”后又因贪污而被开除党籍的。我们必须在“三反”运动胜利的基础上加强机关支部工作，健全党内民主生活，以巩固“三反”的成果，不断地提高党的战斗力。
    二
    为了作好机关中党的工作，必须明确认识机关支部工作的重要性。目前全国数万个机关支部中，有上百万的党员，其中有数十万干部，他们是革命的领导骨干，是国家建设事业的指挥人员。过去革命的伟大胜利是跟他们的英勇奋斗、艰苦努力分不开的；今后要巩固革命的成果，胜利地完成伟大的经济建设和文化建设任务，就必须继续培养他们，提高他们，使他们成为德才兼备的各级领导干部。而培养、提高他们的重要方法之一，就是加强机关支部工作，加强党内的民主生活。因为支部工作是党的政治工作、组织工作、干部工作又是群众工作，只有健全了机关党的支部工作和支部生活，才能加强对党员与非党员的共产主义教育，密切党与群众的联系，巩固党的组织，才能增强政治空气，提高工作效率，保证行政任务的完成。因此每个共产党员，都应当参与和关心机关支部工作，特别是行政负责干部，应经常地指导和协助机关党的工作，反对藉口工作忙而不愿作支部工作的现象。我们应当强调每一个有社会职业的党员，除从事社会职业之外，都必须在党的一个组织的分配之下担负一种工作。否则，不能做一个共产党员。
    为了做好机关党的工作，必须明确规定机关支部的任务。根据中共中央直属机关委员会的经验，机关支部一般地应有六项具体工作：领导与组织机关的全体人员进行学习——包括马克思列宁主义和文化、业务、时事政策的学习；进行党务工作；协助行政系统进行关于工作人员生活福利的各项工作；分配党员在机关内外的群众中进行宣传、组织及其他社会服务工作；协助行政系统进行与检查保密工作和保卫工作；领导机关青年团的工作。
    为了做好机关支部的六项具体工作，必须健全和充实直属机关党委的机构，挑选一批忠实可靠，作风正派，品质优良的党员干部担任此项工作。党员人数较多的机关总支或支部，亦应酌情配备专职干部，以加强对日常工作的领导。必须改选和撤换那些不能胜任和不积极做党的工作的支部书记或支部委员，挑选机关中优秀的密切联系群众的党员担任支部工作。
    同时还要建立和健全机关支部工作的各种制度，包括会议制度，检查制度和学习、生活制度等等。支部委员应明确分工，不宜兼职过多。支部或总支，应把机关中的人员，有计划地组织到各种社会活动中来，要注意使每个党员都能作党的工作，对工作繁忙的负责干部，可指定作专题报告，对水平较低的党员亦分配其作一定的工作。这样，才能充分发挥所有党员的积极性，使他们在工作中得到锻炼和提高，才能使支部的工作和机关的生活活跃起来。此外，各级党委，必须加强对机关支部工作的领导，经常地研究机关支部的各种工作和制度，以及支部的活动方式和方法，并经常地检查总结，推广经验，以便作好机关党的工作。
    三
    要健全党内的民主生活，加强党内的政治思想领导，经常地开展自我批评和自下而上的批评。每一个共产党员，都应该无例外地参加组织生活，应该经常地用批评与自我批评的方法，检讨自己工作中的错误和缺点，并及时地加以纠正。谁如果是一个有了严重错误而不能改正，并居功骄傲，自高自大，坚持错误的人，谁就不能作共产党员。但有些党员和党的组织发现了党员干部有违犯党纪的行为，不是正面地、及时地提到原则高度予以批评纠正，而是采取旁敲侧击、轻描淡写的方式，或是怕伤害了感情，从照顾情绪出发，企图相互迁就，和平共居，其结果是党的纪律松弛，党内的各种错误更加发展。有些党的组织，对一个党员的尚在萌芽时期的错误，很少加以批评和揭发，通常是在某一个党员的错误发展到严重程度时，才不得不进行批评和斗争，其结果就使一个本来可以挽救的党员，发展到不可收拾的地步。事实证明，凡是党内民主生活正常，批评和自我批评开展的地方，党内违法乱纪的现象就比较少，即使有，也很快被揭发和纠正。反之，错误就比较多，也不容易发现和克服。因此必须建立和健全机关中的各种制度，包括民主制度，财务制度，人事制度，工作、生活、学习制度等等。而健全各种制度的关键在于健全党内的民主制度。第一，要定期地召开机关党员代表大会和代表会议，由党委向代表大会或代表会议报告工作，总结经验，接受大会的审查批评，提出今后的工作任务，作出决议，并在党的代表大会上选举党的委员会的委员。第二，机关总支委员会或支部委员会应定期进行改选，定期召开党员大会。凡有关全体党员的重大问题和支部工作计划、工作总结等必须经过总支部或支部党员大会讨论决定。在机关支部内需要普遍进行的或可以统一进行的工作，应由总支或支部召开党员大会，统一地集中地传达布置。会前要充分准备，会议内容要简明扼要，有中心，会后可酌情进行文娱活动，以活跃机关生活。第三，所有党员干部要过严格的组织生活，经常地正确地开展批评和自我批评，养成谦逊民主的作风。第四，经济部门和教育机关应适时地建立政治工作制度和增设作政治工作的副职，并把机关企业、学校中的政治工作和党的工作密切结合起来。如此，才能加强国家工作人员的政治思想领导，既要防止不问政治的偏向，又要防止脱离业务的偏向。第五，召开机关工作人员的代表会议，小组会议和一年一度的、同年终总结工作相配合的民主大会，充分发扬民主，开展自下而上的批评，检查、总结工作，这样，才能及时地发现和克服机关人员中的各种错误思想，提高党员和群众的政治觉悟，也才能克服领导干部的官僚主义。正如列宁说过的，“我们必须用更大的坚持性来发动千百万工农群众自下起来批评，自下起来监督，这是反对官僚主义的主要解毒剂”。如此，“就必须在工人阶级一切群众组织里，而首先在党本身内部展开无产阶级的民主。没有这个条件，自我批评便等于零、一个空架子、一句空话而已。”（见斯大林的“反对把自我批评口号庸俗化”）
