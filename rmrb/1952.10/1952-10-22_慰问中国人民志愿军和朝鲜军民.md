Messages of慰问 to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People

慰问 Letter from the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

Dear comrades of the entire Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

For the sacred mission of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, you have been fighting bravely day and night, selflessly, far away from your homeland, for nearly two years. We, on behalf of the people of the motherland, extend our highest respects and cordial greetings to you!

Comrades, in the war against the most barbarous American imperialism, you have carried forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of the people of the motherland, with a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. You have made great contributions to the independence and freedom of Korea, to the security of the motherland, and to the peace of Asia and the world. You have received the universal respect of the people of the motherland and the unanimous praise of the people of the world! This is your supreme glory, and ours as well!

In the past two years, you have continuously achieved brilliant victories on the battlefield of 抗美援朝, driving the American aggressors from the banks of the Yalu River back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, the starting point of their aggression. You have consumed the enemy in large numbers on the ground and in the air, preventing them from advancing further north. These victories mark that the just struggle of the Chinese and Korean people has laid a solid foundation for victory; they mark that the American aggressors' conspiracy to enslave the Chinese and Korean people, and then to enslave the people of the world, has suffered an irreparable defeat.

Comrades, the people of the motherland, with affectionate hearts, are constantly concerned about your victorious struggle and are determined to support you with all their strength to win a complete victory! In the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the people of the motherland have warmly responded to Chairman Mao's great call to work hard to increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The people of the whole country have already donated funds equivalent to the purchase of 3,710 fighter planes through weapon donations alone. In the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the people of the motherland not only love and support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, but also take care of the families of the Volunteer Army with the greatest enthusiasm. Governments at all levels attach great importance to preferential treatment work, and the broad masses of the people universally include doing a good job in preferential treatment work as part of their patriotic covenants. The families of soldiers are generally respected and given preferential treatment, from organizing farming assistance, guaranteed farming, living relief, and job introductions to free medical treatment and schooling, and even care for them in watching operas, firewood, and drinking water. Many families of Volunteer Army soldiers said, "Our families have received preferential treatment from the government and help from the masses, and we hope that our children will be more brave in eliminating the enemy at the front!"

Comrades, while you are achieving great victories on the Korean battlefield, the people of the motherland have also achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of building the motherland. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, thanks to the wise leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, the three major movements of land reform, 抗美援朝, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries have been successfully carried out. This year, the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements has been achieved. Encouraged by this series of victories, the people of the whole country have more actively launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy. The industrial and agricultural production of the motherland has been restored; in agriculture, the output of grain and cotton has exceeded the highest level before the War of Resistance Against Japan and can be completely self-sufficient; prices have stabilized, and the national fiscal revenue and expenditure have reached complete balance. These achievements mark that the financial and economic situation of the motherland has fundamentally improved, creating sufficient conditions for the large-scale economic and cultural construction that is about to come. This is the result of Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the hard work of the people of the whole country, and it is also the result of the comrades' brave fighting and defending the motherland!

Dear comrades, the great achievements in the economic construction of the motherland have made our motherland more prosperous and stronger. Now the people of the motherland are full of victorious confidence and are supporting you with even more powerful forces. We hope that you will further carry forward the high degree of patriotism and internationalism, for the independence and freedom of Korea, for the security of the motherland, and for the peace of Asia and the world. On the basis of the victories already won, create more brilliant victories and strive for the complete victory of the 抗美援朝 struggle!

Glory belongs to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean people cemented in blood!

Long live the victory of the 抗美援朝 struggle!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!

Letter of慰问 from the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to the Korean People's Army

Dear comrades of the Korean People's Army:

You have demonstrated unparalleled bravery in the just struggle to defend your motherland, defend world peace, and oppose the aggression of American imperialists, and you have established immortal feats. Your great heroism has left a very deep impression on the entire Chinese people. Here, on behalf of the entire Chinese people, we extend brotherly care and cordial greetings to the outstanding sons and daughters of the heroic Korean people, and express our highest respect!

The friendship between our two peoples, the Chinese and Korean people, cemented in flesh and blood, has a glorious historical tradition. Now, when new aggressors are launching a new war of aggression against our friendly country, which is interdependent and shares weal and woe, our people are again with the comrades, inheriting the history of past glorious struggles, carrying forward the high degree of patriotism and internationalism, and resisting the common enemy—the American aggressors. In the years of battle with blood and fire, we have again cemented an unbreakable fighting friendship with blood. This friendship has united into a powerful and invincible force; this friendship is not only deeply rooted at the front line, in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, but also sprouting and growing among the entire Chinese people. At the beginning of this year, when the Korean People's Delegation to China came to our country, our people, upon hearing the reports from the representatives about the heroic struggles of Korean Democratic People's Republic double heroes Li Xuewen, Kang Bo, Li Wujun, Nan Wanshou, and others, were all delighted and inspired, and paid their respects. After listening to the reports, the workers and farmers expressed that they would work hard to produce and increase output, and resolutely support the comrades. After listening to the reports, the children immediately gave their beloved red scarves to the representatives, and affectionately shouted, "Brave People's Army Uncles!" There is such a story: An old mother in Dihua City, Xinjiang, who lived to be 103 years old, was moved by your heroic deeds, so she personally sewed a mattress with 188 pieces of "longevity" cloth overnight and sent it to the representatives to take to the front line to keep the comrades warm. Your mothers and the Volunteer Army's mothers hugged each other as soon as they met. They felt gratified and proud that their sons were jointly resisting the American aggressors! Dear comrades! Our friendship is endless, and we firmly believe that the great friendship solidified with blood is unbreakable and cannot be defeated by any reactionary force!

Dear comrades! You have endured unimaginable hardships and difficulties in the struggle. The American aggressors destroyed the comrades' homes, and countless innocent parents, wives and children, brothers and sisters were subjected to the bloody massacre by the robbers. The Chinese people, with hearts that have deeply suffered, express deep sympathy for the profound disasters suffered by our country that shares weal and woe. Our people hate this inhumane atrocity of the American robbers. The American robbers, with this brutal means, attempted to make our heroic friendly nation yield, and attempted to scare the Chinese people who have already stood up. This is impossible. On the contrary, the Korean people, with increasingly resolute fighting spirit, with a confidence full of victory and heroic spirit, have continuously given resolute counterattacks to American imperialism. For two years, the heroic Chinese and Korean People's Armies have closely cooperated and fought in coordination, giving the enemy a serious blow, causing the enemy to suffer irreparable losses on the ground, at sea, and in the air. From October 25, 1950 to the end of July this year alone, we have annihilated more than 570,000 American and Li bandits, of which the American aggressor army lost more than 250,000 troops. This is our most merciless answer to the American aggressors' attempt to subdue us with slaughter and terror.

Dear comrades! Our just struggle has now achieved a decisive victory. Chairman Mao Zedong, the most respected leader of our Chinese people, said in his telegram congratulating your heroic country on the 7th anniversary of its liberation: "In order to resist the common enemy, for the peace of Korea and the security of China, the Chinese people will always stand firmly with the Korean people and fight to completely defeat the American imperialist aggressors." This is the unanimous wish and determination of our entire Chinese people. Dear comrades! Let us hold hands tightly and shout:

Long live the close friendship between our two peoples cemented in blood in battle!

Long live the victory of the anti-aggression struggle of the Chinese and Korean people for the motherland and for world peace!

Long live the heroic Korean People's Army!

Long live the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

Long live General Kim Il-sung, the most respected leader of the Korean people!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

The Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea September 18, 1952

Letter of慰问 from the China Peace Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

Dear comrades of the entire Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

On the occasion of the departure of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, we—the China Peace Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea—specially extend warm greetings and high respect to all our heroic Volunteer Army comrades on behalf of the patriotic compatriots of the whole country!

The heroic and arduous struggle you and the Korean People's Army have been engaged in for two years has not only effectively defended the security of the motherland, guaranteed the independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and crushed the American aggressors' aggressive plan to conquer Korea and then attack the Chinese mainland; it has also inspired and strengthened the courage and confidence of the people of the whole country and the world to resist aggression and defend peace. The victory you have achieved is an extremely significant contribution to our great motherland, to Asia, and to the cause of world peace!

Now the people of the whole country, like you, clearly see that: although the evil enemy has suffered a serious defeat, they still insist on carrying out the war of aggression against Korea. They continue to delay and obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations, vainly attempt to detain a large number of our prisoners of war, continue to massacre our prisoners of war, recklessly bomb peaceful cities and villages and peaceful residents of Korea, and continue to carry out inhumane bacteriological warfare, vainly attempting to force us to submit and create international tension. At the same time, they are stepping up the arming of West Germany in Europe and stepping up the arming of Japan in the Far East as an important preparatory step for provoking a new world war. All this shows that our heroic Volunteer Army and the people of the whole country must continue to strengthen the struggle, strive for the victorious conclusion of the 抗美援朝 war, strive for a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue, and restore and consolidate peace in Asia and the world, and will not stop until the goal is achieved!

The enemy has many difficulties. The victory we and the Korean people have achieved has disrupted the enemy's timetable for the war of aggression, causing the enemy to suffer a serious blow, and thus be afraid. The struggle of the people of various oppressed countries to win liberation, and the development of the peace movement of the people of the whole world, especially in Asia and the Pacific region, have given and will give greater encouragement to our struggle against aggression and for defending peace, democracy, and freedom. The unbreakable and increasingly strengthened friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union is a strong guarantee for preventing new threats of aggression and consolidating peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, as long as our front and rear are united as one, strengthen our efforts, and strengthen unity with our international friends, and work together, any conspiracy of the enemy to continue aggression and expand the war can certainly be crushed by us.

Dear comrades! Now that the people of the whole country have completed various domestic democratic reforms and the industrial and agricultural production has shifted from the recovery stage to the development stage, they are preparing to start large-scale economic construction and other construction projects, and are continuing to strengthen the 抗美援朝 work and fully support your operations. The people of our whole country are marching forward towards the victory of the anti-aggression struggle, towards the victory of building our great motherland, and towards the victory of lasting world peace!

Dear comrades! You have worked hard! The people of the whole country are thinking of you all the time, so now we are sending a delegation to Korea again to慰问 you. This delegation will bring you the warm care and respect of the people of the motherland for you. The people of the whole country hope and wish you in advance to make greater contributions to the Korean people, to the people of the motherland, and to the peace of Asia and the world! I wish you good health!

Letter of慰问 from the China Peace Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to the Korean People and the Korean People's Army

Dear comrades of the Korean people and the heroic Korean People's Army:

On the occasion of the departure of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, we—the China Peace Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea—on behalf of all the people of our country, extend warm greetings and high respect to you—the heroic nation and heroic armed forces who have made great contributions to the cause of peace!

For more than two years, under the wise leadership of General Kim Il-sung, you have heavily hit the American aggressors in order to defend the independence and freedom of your motherland and to defend peace in Asia and the world. Together with the sons and daughters of our people—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—you have overcome and are overcoming the despicable attacks and reckless bombings of the American aggressors on the front and in the rear, and crushed the inhumane bacteriological warfare of the aggressors; your representatives, together with the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, have exposed all the tricks of the American aggressors to delay and sabotage the negotiations at the armistice negotiation meetings; you and the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have together held high the just banner of the anti-aggression war and are marching from victory to victory.

Your victory is the victory of the people of our country and the victory of world peace and democracy. Therefore, the people of the whole world are concerned about you with sympathy and admiration, and support you with various forms of practical and powerful actions. The various barbaric crimes committed by the American aggressors in Korea have been unanimously condemned by the peace-loving people of the world, and will inevitably be subjected to due sanctions.

We, the Chinese people, are linked to you like brothers and sisters, and are connected by flesh and blood. We stood with you in the past, we stand with you now, and we will always stand with you in the future. We are determined to continue to fully support your just struggle, and we will never give up until the victorious conclusion of the Korean War and a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue are achieved!

We believe that relying on the increasingly strengthened unity of the people of our two countries in battle, and relying on the support and support of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the people of all countries in the world, our common anti-aggression struggle will surely achieve final victory.

Long live the heroic nation—the Korean people!

Long live the heroic army—the Korean People's Army!

Long live General Kim Il-sung, the most respected leader of the Korean people!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the most respected leader of the Chinese people!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!

    慰问中国人民志愿军和朝鲜军民
    中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团给中国人民志愿军的慰问信亲爱的中国人民志愿军全体同志们：
    为了抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务，你们远离祖国，日以继夜、奋不顾身地英勇作战，即将两周年了。我们谨代表祖国的人民，向你们致崇高的敬礼和亲切的慰问！
    同志们，你们在和最野蛮的美帝国主义作战中，发扬了祖国人民光荣的革命传统，以高度的爱国主义与国际主义精神，为朝鲜的独立和自由，为祖国的安全，为亚洲与世界的和平，建立了伟大的功勋，受到了祖国人民的普遍尊敬，获得了全世界人民的同声赞扬！这是你们，同时也是我们的无上光荣！
    两年来，你们在抗美援朝战场，已经不断取得了辉煌的胜利，把美国侵略者从鸭绿江边打回到它发动侵略的出发地点——三八线附近，在地面和天空大量地消耗了敌人，使它无法北进一步。这些胜利，标志着中朝人民的正义斗争，已经打下了巩固的胜利基础；标志着美国侵略者奴役中朝人民、进而奴役全世界人民的侵略阴谋，已经遭受到无法挽救的失败。
    同志们，祖国人民怀着敬爱的心情，时刻地关心着你们胜利的斗争，决以全力来支持你们争取彻底的胜利！祖国人民在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，热烈地响应了毛主席努力增加生产、厉行节约以支持中国人民志愿军的伟大号召，全国人民即以捐献武器一项，已经捐献了可以购买三千七百一十架战斗机的献款。祖国人民在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，不仅热爱和支援着中国人民志愿军，而且以最大的热情照顾志愿军家属。各级人民政府对优抚工作都十分重视，广大人民普遍把做好优抚工作列为爱国公约的内容之一，军属普遍受到尊敬和优待，从组织代耕、包耕、生活救济、介绍职业到免费治病、入学，并且连看戏、烧柴、饮水都照顾在内。许多志愿军家属都说：“家里都受到了政府的优待和群众的帮助，希望我们的子女在前方更加勇敢地消灭敌人！”
    同志们，你们在朝鲜战场取得伟大胜利的同时，祖国人民在建设祖国的事业中，也获得了辉煌的成就。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，由于共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的英明领导，胜利地进行了土地改革、抗美援朝和镇压反革命的三大运动，今年又取得了“三反”“五反”运动的伟大胜利。全国人民在这一连串的胜利鼓舞之下，更加积极地开展了增产节约运动。祖国的工农业生产已经恢复；农业方面，粮食和棉花的产量，已经超过抗日战争前最高年份的水平，而完全可以自给；物价已经稳定，国家财政收支已经达到完全平衡。这些成就，标志着祖国财政经济情况已经根本好转，给即将到来的大规模的经济建设、文化建设创造了充分的条件。这是毛主席英明领导和全国人民奋勇劳动的结果，更是同志们英勇奋战，保卫祖国的结果！
    亲爱的同志们，祖国经济建设方面的伟大成就，使我们祖国更加富强起来。现在祖国人民正充满着胜利的信心以更加强大的力量来支援你们。希望你们更加发扬高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，为了朝鲜的独立与自由，为了祖国的安全，为了亚洲与世界的和平，在已得的胜利基础上，创造更辉煌的胜利，争取抗美援朝斗争的彻底胜利！
    光荣属于中国人民志愿军！
    中朝人民以鲜血凝结成的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    抗美援朝斗争胜利万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
    　　　　　中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团
    　　　　　　　　　一九五二年九月十八日
    中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团给朝鲜人民军的慰问信亲爱的朝鲜人民军同志们：
    你们在保卫祖国、保卫世界和平、反对美帝国主义侵略者的正义斗争中，表现了无比的英勇，建立了不朽的功勋。你们这种伟大的英雄气概，在全中国人民中间留下了非常深刻的印象。在这里，我们谨代表全中国人民，向英雄的朝鲜人民的优秀儿女表示兄弟般的关怀与亲切的慰问，并致崇高的敬意！
    我们中朝两国人民用血肉结成的友谊，是有其光荣的历史传统的。现在，当新的侵略者对我们唇齿相依、安危与共的友邦进行新的侵略战争的时候，我国人民又与同志们在一起，继承了过去光荣斗争的历史，发扬了高度的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，抗击着共同的敌人——美国侵略者。在血与火的战斗的岁月里，我们又以鲜血凝结成牢不可破的战斗友谊。这个友谊，已团结成为强大的不可战胜的力量；这个友谊不但在前线、在中国人民志愿军中根深蒂固，而且在全中国人民中间发芽滋长。在今年年初，朝鲜人民访华代表团来到我国，我国人民听到代表们报告了像朝鲜民主主义人民共和国双重英雄李学文，英雄康波、李五俊、南万寿等英勇斗争的事迹，莫不欢欣鼓舞，肃然起敬。工人们和农民们听了报告，表示要努力生产，提高产量，坚决支援同志们。孩子们听了报告，立即把心爱的红领巾送给代表们，并亲切地喊着：“勇敢的人民军叔叔！”有这样的事：新疆迪化市有一位活到一百零三岁的老妈妈，她为你们的英雄事迹所感动，就亲手用一百八十八块“长命”布，连夜缝成了一块褥单送给代表们，带到前线给同志们御寒。你们的母亲与志愿军的母亲一见面就拥抱起来，她们为自己的儿子在共同抗击着美国侵略者而感到欣慰，感到骄傲！亲爱的同志们！我们的友谊是写不完，说不尽的，我们坚信，用鲜血凝固成的伟大友谊，是牢不可破的，是任何反动力量不能战胜的！
    亲爱的同志们！你们在斗争中经受了难以想像的艰苦和困难。美国侵略者毁灭了同志们的家，无数无辜的父母妻儿、兄弟姐妹，遭受到强盗们血腥的屠杀。对于我们患难与共的国家所遭受到的深重的灾难，中国人民以曾经深受过痛楚的心情，寄以深切的同情。我国人民痛恨美国强盗们的这种灭绝人性的暴行。美国强盗以这种残暴手段，企图要我们英雄的友邦屈服，企图吓倒已经站起来的中国人民，这是办不到的。恰恰相反，朝鲜人民以日益坚决的斗志，以充满胜利的信心与英雄气概，接连地给美帝国主义以坚决的回击。两年来，英雄的中朝人民军队密切配合，协同作战，给了敌人以严重的打击，使敌人在地面、在海上和天空中，均遭受到无法补偿的损失。单从一九五零年十月二十五日起到今年七月底止，我们已歼灭了美、李匪军五十七万余人，其中美国侵略军就损失了二十五万兵力以上，这就是我们给美国侵略者想以屠杀、恐怖来屈服我们的最无情的回答。
    亲爱的同志们！我们的正义斗争，现在已经取得了决定性的胜利。我们中国人民最敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席在祝贺你们英雄的国家解放七周年的电文中所说的：“为了抗击共同的敌人，为了朝鲜的和平及中国的安全，中国人民将永远坚定地与朝鲜人民在一起，为彻底战胜美帝国主义侵略者而奋斗”，这就是我们全中国人民一致的愿望与决心。亲爱的同志们！让我们紧密地携起手来，高呼：
    我们两国人民在战斗中以鲜血结成的亲密友谊万岁！
    朝中人民为祖国、为世界和平的反侵略斗争胜利万岁！
    英雄的朝鲜人民军万岁！
    英雄的中国人民志愿军万岁！
    朝鲜人民最敬爱的领袖金日成将军万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团  一九五二年九月十八日
    中国人民抗美援朝总会给中国人民志愿军的慰问信亲爱的中国人民志愿军全体同志们：
    值此中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团出发之际，我们——中国人民抗美援朝总会特代表全国爱国的同胞们向我们英勇的全体志愿军同志们致以热烈的慰问和崇高的敬意！
    两年来，你们和朝鲜人民军在一起所进行的英勇卓绝的斗争，不仅有效地保卫了祖国的安全，保障了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立，粉碎了美国侵略者妄图征服朝鲜、进而进攻中国大陆的侵略计划；并且同时鼓舞和加强了全国以及全世界人民反抗侵略、保卫和平的勇气和信心。你们所获得的胜利，是对于我们伟大祖国、对于亚洲以及世界和平事业的极其重大的贡献！
    现在全国人民和你们一样清楚地看到：万恶的敌人虽然已经遭遇到严重的失败，但是他们仍然坚持进行侵略朝鲜的战争，他们继续拖延和阻挠朝鲜停战谈判，妄想扣留我方大量被俘人员，他们继续残杀我方战俘，狂轰滥炸朝鲜的和平城市、乡村与和平居民，继续进行灭绝人性的细菌战，妄图迫使我方屈服，并制造国际间的紧张局势。和这同时，他们正在欧洲加紧武装西德，在远东加紧武装日本，来作为挑起新的世界大战的重要准备步骤。所有这些都说明，我们英勇的志愿军和全国人民，必须继续加强斗争，争取抗美援朝战争的胜利结束，争取朝鲜问题的公平合理解决，恢复和巩固亚洲与全世界的和平，不达目的，誓不休止！
    敌人是有许多困难的。我们和朝鲜人民在一起所取得的胜利，已打乱了敌人侵略战争的时间表，使敌人遭受了严重打击，因而有所畏惧。各被压迫国家人民争取解放的斗争，和全世界的、尤其是亚洲及太平洋区域的人民和平运动的发展，已经给了、今后还要给予我们反对侵略保卫和平民主自由斗争以更大的鼓舞。牢不可破的、日益加强的中苏两国人民的友谊团结，更是制止新侵略威胁、巩固亚洲与全世界和平的坚强保障。因此，只要我们前方后方万众一心，加强努力，并与我们的国际友人加强团结，一致努力，敌人的任何继续侵略和扩大战争的阴谋，都是一定可以被我们粉碎的。
    亲爱的同志们！现在全国人民在完成了国内各项民主改革和工农业生产已由恢复阶段转入发展阶段之后，正在准备开始大规模的经济建设及其他各项建设，并且在继续加强抗美援朝工作，全力支持你们的作战。我们全国人民，正向着争取反侵略斗争的胜利，向着争取建设我们伟大祖国的胜利，向着争取世界持久和平的胜利而迈步前进！
    亲爱的同志们！你们辛苦了！全国人民无时无刻不在想念着你们，因此现在特再一次派遣赴朝慰问团来慰问你们。这个代表团将带给你们以祖国人民对你们的热烈的关怀和敬意。全国人民希望你们并预祝你们为朝鲜人民、为祖国人民、为亚洲和世界的和平，建立更大的功勋！祝你们身体健康！
    中国人民抗美援朝总会  一九五二年九月十八日
    中国人民抗美援朝总会给朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军的慰问信亲爱的朝鲜人民及英雄的朝鲜人民军全体同志们：
    值此中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团出发之际，我们——中国人民抗美援朝总会，谨代表我国全体人民，向你们——为和平事业作了伟大贡献的英雄民族和英雄武装部队，致以热烈的慰问和崇高的敬意！
    两年多以来，你们在金日成将军的英明领导下，为了捍卫祖国的独立和自由，为了捍卫亚洲与全世界的和平，沉重地打击了美国侵略者。你们与我国人民所派遣的子弟兵——中国人民志愿军在一起，在前线和后方，战胜了和正在战胜着美国侵略者的卑鄙进攻和狂轰滥炸，粉碎了侵略者的灭绝人性的细菌战；你们的代表与中国人民志愿军的代表在一起，在停战谈判的会议上，揭穿了美国侵略者拖延和破坏谈判的一切诡计；你们与中国人民及中国人民志愿军在一起，高举着反侵略战争的正义旗帜，从胜利走向胜利。
    你们的胜利就是我国人民的胜利，就是世界和平民主的胜利。因此，全世界的人民正以同情而敬慕的心情关切着你们，以各种方式的实际而有力的行动支援着你们。美国侵略者在朝鲜所犯下的各种野蛮罪行，已经受到全世界爱好和平的人民的一致谴责，并必将受到应得的制裁。
    我们中国人民，和你们手足相连，血肉相依。我们过去和你们站在一起，现在和你们站在一起，今后将永远和你们站在一起。我们决心继续全力支持你们的正义斗争，不达到朝鲜战争的胜利结束、朝鲜问题的公平合理解决，誓不罢休！
    我们相信：依靠我们两国人民在战斗中日益加强的团结，依靠着以苏联为首的和平民主阵营以及世界各国人民的声援和支持，我们共同的反侵略斗争必然取得最后胜利。
    英雄的民族——朝鲜人民万岁！
    英雄的军队——朝鲜人民军万岁！
    朝鲜人民最敬爱的领袖金日成将军万岁！
    中国人民最敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    中朝两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
