Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Poland is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections on October 26th. The preparations for the election have been carried out enthusiastically throughout the country and are now in the final stage.

    In August, after the Polish parliament passed the parliamentary election law and the Polish government decided on the election date, the Polish people actively carried out election preparations. The National Front of Poland elected the Parliamentary Election Committee in late August and announced the election platform in early September. Subsequently, working people in various places held rallies to enthusiastically support this platform and elected their election committees. On September 18th, at the congresses convened by the local election committees, working people across the country put forward their candidates for parliament. Bolesław Bierut, President of the Polish People's Republic and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, was nominated as the first candidate in the congresses throughout the country. The list of candidates for parliament included leaders of various political parties, economic and social organizations, shock workers, advanced farmers, and famous figures in science and the arts.

    Currently, the election activities have entered the final stage. Candidates are enthusiastically meeting with voters in various places and delivering campaign speeches. President Bierut met with voters in the Warsaw electoral district on October 23rd. When he appeared on the podium, the entire audience responded with stormy cheers. In his speech, President Bierut reviewed the situation in which the Polish working people were deprived of their democratic rights by the bourgeois-landlord reactionary regime in the past, and described the various achievements made by the Polish people since liberation. In Katowice, Lublin, Krakow, and other places, the gatherings of candidates and voters have become powerful demonstrations of the Polish people's unity around the election platform of the National Front of Poland.

    【本报讯】据新华社讯：波兰定于十月二十六日举行议会选举。选举的筹备工作在各地热烈展开后，现在已进入了最后阶段。
    八月间，在波兰议会通过了议会选举法，波兰政府决定了选举日期之后，波兰人民即积极进行选举的筹备工作。波兰全国阵线在八月下旬选出了议会选举委员会，并在九月上旬公布了选举纲领。接着，各地劳动人民纷纷举行集会，热烈拥护这个纲领，并选出了他们的选举委员会。九月十八日，全国劳动人民在各地选举委员会所召集的大会上，纷纷提出了他们的议员候选人。波兰人民共和国总统、波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席贝鲁特，在各地的大会上都被提名为第一名候选人。议员候选人名单中包括各政党、经济和社会组织的领袖，突击工人、先进农民、著名的科学与艺术界人士。
    现在，选举活动已进入了最后阶段。候选人正在各地和选民们热烈会晤，并发表竞选演说。贝鲁特总统是在十月二十三日和华沙选区的选民会晤的。当他出现在会议主席台上时，全场报以暴风雨般的欢呼声。贝鲁特总统在演说中回顾了波兰劳动人民过去被资产阶级—地主反动政权剥夺民主权利的情况，并叙述了波兰人民解放以来所获得的种种成就。在卡托维兹、卢布林、克拉科夫等地。候选人和选民的集会，都变成了波兰人民团结在波兰全国阵线选举纲领周围的强有力的示威。
