Xinhua News Agency Report: The eighth day of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference began at 9:20 AM on the 9th. The atmosphere of the 9th’s meeting was filled with deeply moving peace and amity. The entire venue repeatedly applauded enthusiastically, welcoming representatives who recounted the peaceful and happy lives of their people, welcoming those who vehemently denounced the crimes of U.S. imperialism in infringing upon national independence and threatening peace. Especially when the peace delegations from Pakistan and India solemnly vowed to the assembly that the people of the two countries would cooperate in brotherly friendship and warmly embraced each other, the entire venue applauded and cheered ecstatically for more than ten minutes.

The executive chairpersons for the 9th’s meeting were: Mrs. Olga Poblete (Chile), Guo Moruo (China), Surioso (Indonesia), Shirindib (Mongolia), Isabel Milton Serney (United States).

After the executive chairperson, Mrs. Olga Poblete, announced the opening of the meeting, Secretary-General Liu Ningyi announced: "As of the 8th, the total number of people who have given reports, supplementary reports, and speeches at the conference has reached 70."

The 9th’s meeting heard speeches from nine representatives, bringing the total number of speakers at the conference to 79. These speakers possessed extremely broad representation, coming from 44 countries in Asia, the Americas, Europe, and North Africa, representing the 41 countries attending and observing the conference, and seven international democratic organizations.

Nohak Phomsavan, head of the Lao delegation, spoke first, paying tribute on behalf of the Lao people, who are fighting for national independence, to the freedom-loving and peace-loving people of the Asian and Pacific region. Phomsavan condemned the crimes of the French colonialists, supported by U.S. imperialist interventionists, in carrying out wars of aggression in Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. He concluded his speech by reiterating the Lao people’s will for peace, freedom, and independence, and to strengthen friendly cooperation with the people of the world. The entire venue applauded warmly.

The Soviet representative, Tursun-Zade, the famous poet of the Tajik Republic, delivered his speech with unbridled enthusiasm. He said: The fact that representatives of the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific region have gathered in China for the most noble common cause of striving for peace is the most powerful proof that free and great China, due to its historical victory over domestic and foreign dark forces, and due to its unbreakable friendship with the powerful Soviet Union, has truly become a country of peace and friendship for the people of Eastern countries. He said: The true youth of the East has arrived. He then vividly and movingly described the vigorous development of the Tajik nation after the October Revolution. Tursun-Zade emphasized that the example of the Tajik people illustrates that under peaceful and free conditions, with cultural and economic exchanges between peoples of all countries, both large and small nations can obtain a happy life. Therefore, the Soviet people advocate peace and friendship. He said: We must drive the warmongers to the end of the road. Let us declare that the first rule of mankind is peace!

When Tursun-Zade stepped down from the podium after his speech, the entire venue stood up and applauded enthusiastically.

Alfredo D. Amestoy, a retired colonel and representative of Chile, spoke next. In his speech, he exposed the United States’ control over Chile in political, economic, and military aspects, and described the Chilean people’s struggle to defend national independence and strive for peace. He praised the Chinese people’s will for peace and their deep friendship, saying: After we return to Chile, we will loudly tell the people everything we have seen at this meeting and in this country. His speech won warm applause from the entire venue.

Carlos Francisco Changmarín, the representative of Panama, delivered a passionate speech that was greatly welcomed. Changmarín compared Panama to the "White-Haired Girl" of Latin America, because the American jackals do not want Panama to become a free country, but hope that Panama will become the "White-Haired Girl" living in the dark cave of imperialist exploitation. Changmarín concluded by saying: The Panama Canal, which is still in the hands of American bandits today, must become a bridge to the world, and the whole world will pass through here, waving salutes of brotherly friendship and peace, where men shake hands, women kiss, and children sing and blend together. We repeat, this beautiful canal must never be used for war.

Luis Rivera Terrazas, the representative of Mexico, pointed out in his speech that as a result of the United States’ implementation of its aggressive plan, many countries have lost their independence. Terrazas emphasized that it is important that the broad masses of the people must participate in the struggle for peace and national independence. For example, the Mexican people shattered the threat of concluding a bilateral military agreement with the United States. He also pointed out that to achieve this goal, it is necessary to know how to connect the basic struggle of mankind for survival with the most urgent struggles of the people.

The meeting then recessed and continued at 11:50 AM, presided over by Guo Moruo, the executive chairperson and deputy head of the Chinese delegation.

Le Thi Thuy, a female representative from Vietnam and a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Vietnam Women's Union, stepped onto the podium amidst applause. She said: The August Revolution in Vietnam has ended the tragic fate of Vietnamese women and children under French colonial rule for a century, and has begun to build a happy life. However, the French colonialists and American interventionists have once again launched a war of aggression against the Vietnamese people. She then angrily denounced the barbaric atrocities of the French invading army in killing children and raping women over the past seven years. She said: It is precisely such blood and tears of hatred that have enraged the Vietnamese people and Vietnamese women to take up arms to eliminate the enemy.

Surioso, head of the Indonesian delegation, spoke next. He expressed the will of the peace-loving Indonesian people to oppose the war policy of the U.S. government. He used the recollection of the serious suffering inflicted on the Indonesian people by Japanese militarism during its occupation of Indonesia in World War II to explain why the Indonesian people must oppose the re-militarization of Japan and oppose the San Francisco Treaty by which U.S. imperialism uses Japan as an instrument of aggression. He paid tribute on behalf of the Indonesian people to the fighting actions of the Japanese people who are striving for democracy and peace. Surioso emphasized that bitter lessons have made the Indonesian people even more vigilant against all conspiracies and activities of U.S. imperialism attempting to drag them into a war-preparation bloc. The Indonesian people reject all conventions or agreements that endanger peace.

Next, Ravi Shankar Shivram Vyas, the Indian representative, a follower of Gandhi, a famous philanthropist and poet, and a 67-year-old peace warrior, took the stage. He said: All the Indian people love peace and hate war, and the masses all over the world are eager for peace, but peace will not fall from the sky, it must be fought for. He said: All aggression must be resisted. Personally, I believe that non-violent resistance is the best method of resistance, but there is no reason for those who think this is impractical or impossible to willingly be cowards. Therefore, I fully sympathize with those who are bravely resisting aggression and defending national honor and independence in Korea, Malaya, and Vietnam. The old man said indignantly: The disasters suffered by Korea, in particular, fill my heart with hatred for the aggressors. Therefore, we must form a global public opinion that forces the U.S. government to withdraw its troops, at which time the Chinese People's Volunteers may no longer need to stay on Korean soil. He said: The people of all countries in the world should do their utmost to resist those who attempt to plunder the fruits of their collective labor, and only then can we lay a true foundation for lasting world peace. The kind and resolute words spoken by this devout Gandhian were repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause.

At this time, an unforgettable scene appeared in the conference hall. Amid thunderous applause, Louis Wheaton, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Conference and Head of the U.S. Delegation, announced a joint statement issued by the Indian and Pakistani delegations after consultation (full text issued separately). This statement solemnly expressed to the representatives of the Asian and Pacific countries the desire for brotherly friendship between the people of India and Pakistan. Then, four Indian representatives, led by Kitchlew, head of the Indian delegation and chairman of the All-India Peace Council, and four Pakistani representatives, led by Sharif, head of the Pakistani delegation and a well-known Islamic leader, walked onto the stage amidst cheers, applause, and music, and under the kind gaze of more than 400 peace warriors from more than 40 countries, solemnly signed the statement. During the signing, the representatives of the two countries below the stage walked to each other’s seats and threw flowers symbolizing friendship and happiness. After the signing, the representatives of the two countries on the stage put on garlands representing brotherly friendship and presented each other with gifts. The Indian representative presented the Pakistani representative with a lacquer box produced in Kashmir and a silk fabric embroidered with the scenery of the Summer Palace, to commemorate Beijing, the location that made this gathering and the joint statement by the representatives of the two countries possible. Sharif, the head of the Pakistani delegation, presented Kitchlew, the head of the Indian delegation, with a gold-embroidered hat (according to Punjabi custom, people give each other hats when they become brothers), and presented the Indian delegation with a carved wooden box produced in Beijing to commemorate this grand event. After the gifts were exchanged, the representatives of the two countries enthusiastically embraced each other for a long time. Immediately afterwards, Kitchlew and Sharif jointly presented the signed statement and a banner embroidered in Urdu, Chinese, and English with the words "Long Live World Peace" to Guo Moruo, the executive chairman of the conference, and put a garland on Guo Moruo, and the venue cheered. Then, the representatives of the two countries walked off the stage hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, in close harmony. The representatives of both countries walked to each other’s seats, shook hands, embraced, and warmly congratulated this good and important start to peace and friendship between the people of India and Pakistan. Several representatives from the two delegations were lifted high by the cheering crowd. This touching and sincere scene of brotherly friendship moved many representatives to tears. The entire venue stood up and applauded and cheered ecstatically for more than ten minutes.

Guo Moruo then stood up to speak, saying: "In the name of the executive chairman of the conference, I warmly welcome the joint statement of the Indian and Pakistani delegations. I believe that the goodwill and friendly consultation attitude expressed in this joint statement, as well as its spirit of seeking solutions independently, will definitely be beneficial to the resolution of the long-pending Kashmir issue. I propose that this joint statement be included in the conference records."

At this time, the gradually calmed venue once again erupted in cheers and applause, expressing the conference's welcome and support for this proposal.

Mario Fabio, a specially invited representative from Brazil, a doctor, and a professor at the University of Rio de Janeiro, then took the stage to speak. He denounced the U.S. government's act of forcing Brazil to sign an enslaving bilateral military agreement. He said that the attempt to force the signing of this agreement has aroused strong anger and protest in various Latin American countries, and in Brazil, the tide of struggle is rising higher and higher. A national front against military agreements has been established. He pointed out that regardless of whether Congress will approve this agreement, not a single soldier of the Brazilian army or navy will attack his Korean brothers, because the Brazilian people fundamentally oppose this ugly war.

Finally, Deputy Secretary-General Wheaton announced that the conference had received congratulatory telegrams from groups and individuals in many countries.

The conference adjourned at 1:40 PM.

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第八日会议
    继续听取各国和平代表发言
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议第八日会议在九日上午九时二十分开始举行。九日的会议上充满感人至深的和平友爱的气氛。全场曾多次热烈鼓掌，欢迎那叙述本国人民的和平幸福生活的代表，欢迎那些激昂地斥责美帝国主义侵犯民族独立威胁和平的代表。特别是当巴基斯坦和印度两国和平代表团庄严地向大会誓言两国人民将兄弟般地友好合作，并热情地携手拥抱的时候，全场为之忘情地鼓掌欢呼达十数分钟之久。
    九日会议的执行主席是：奥尔加·波布列特夫人（智利），郭沫若（中国），苏鲁梭（印度尼西亚），锡林迪布（蒙古），依莎贝尔·密尔顿·塞尔奈（美国）。
    主持会议的执行主席奥尔加·波布列特夫人宣布开会后，秘书长刘宁一宣布：“截至八日止在大会上作报告、补充报告及发言的人数已共达七十人。”
    九日的会议听取了九个代表的发言，至此在会上发言的人数共为七十九人。这些发言人具有极其广泛的代表性，他们来自亚洲、美洲、欧洲、北非洲的四十四个国家，代表了出席和列席会议的四十一个国家及七个国际民主组织。
    寮国代表团团长诺哈·冯沙万首先发言，他代表正在为民族独立而进行抗战的寮国人民，向爱好自由和平的亚洲及太平洋区域的人民致敬。冯沙万斥责法国殖民者在美帝国主义干涉者的支持下，在寮国、越南、高棉进行侵略战争的罪行。他最后重申寮国人民对和平、自由与独立及与全世界人民加强友好合作的意志来结束了他的演说。全场掌声热烈。
    苏联代表、塔吉克共和国的著名诗人图尔逊—萨德，以奔放的热情发表他的讲演。他说：亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的代表为了最崇高的争取和平的共同事业，在中国聚集一堂，这最有力地证明了：自由伟大的中国，由于对国内外黑暗势力取得历史性的胜利，由于与强大的苏联有着牢不可破的友谊，已真正成为对东方各国人民和平友好的国家。他说：东方真正的青春已经来临了。他接着生动感人地叙述了塔吉克民族在十月革命后朝气蓬勃的发展的事实。图尔逊—萨德强调指出：塔吉克人民的例子说明：在和平自由的条件下，在各国人民文化与经济交流的情况下，不论大小民族都是可以获得幸福生活的。因此，苏联人民主张和平友好。他说：我们必须使战争贩子走头无路。让我们宣布人类的第一条法规是和平！
    图尔逊—萨德发言后走下讲台时，全场起立，报以热烈的鼓掌。
    智利代表、退伍上校阿尔弗莱脱·第·阿迈斯脱接着发言。他在发言中揭发了美国在政治、经济、军事等方面对于智利的控制，并叙述了智利人民为保卫民族独立和争取和平而斗争的情况。他盛赞中国人民爱好和平的意志和深挚的友情，他说：我们回到智利之后要大声地告诉人民我们在这个会议和这个国家所看到的一切。他的发言博得了全场的热烈鼓掌。
    巴拿马代表卡罗斯·弗兰西斯科·钱玛林发表了热情洋溢的讲演，受到极大的欢迎。钱玛林把巴拿马比作拉丁美洲的“白毛女”，因为美国豺狼不愿意巴拿马成为自由的国家，而希望巴拿马变成“白毛女”住在帝国主义剥削的黑洞中。钱玛林最后说：今日仍在美国匪徒手中的巴拿马运河必须成为一座世界的桥梁，整个世界都将从这里通过，挥动互致兄弟的友爱与和平的敬礼，那里是男人们握手、妇女们亲吻、孩子们歌唱着融合在一起的地方。我们重复说一遍，这条美丽的运河决不能用于战争。
    墨西哥代表路易斯·里维拉·泰拉萨斯发言指出：美国执行侵略计划的结果，使许多国家丧失了独立。泰拉萨斯强调说：重要的是广大人民必须参加争取和平与争取民族独立的斗争，例如墨西哥人民就曾粉碎了和美国缔结双边军事协定的威胁。他并且指出，要实现这个目的，必须知道怎样把人类要求生存的基本斗争和人民最迫切的斗争联系起来。
    会议至此休息，在十一时五十分继续进行，由执行主席、中国代表团副团长郭沫若主持。
    越南女代表、越南妇女联合会中央执行委员黎真芳在鼓掌声中走上讲台。她说：越南的八月革命已经结束了越南妇女儿童一世纪以来在法国殖民统治下的悲惨命运，开始建设幸福的生活，但是，法国殖民者和美国干涉者却再一次对越南人民发动侵略战争。她接着激愤地控诉七年来法国侵略军残杀儿童、奸淫妇女的野蛮兽行。她说：正是这样的血泪仇恨激怒了越南人民和越南妇女拿起武器去消灭敌人。
    印尼代表团团长苏洛多接着发言。他表明了爱好和平的印尼人民反对美国政府的战争政策的意志。他用追述日本军国主义在第二次世界大战占领印尼期间给予印尼人民的严重苦难，来说明为什么印尼人民一定要反对日本重新军国主义化，反对美帝国主义利用日本作为侵略工具的旧金山条约。他代表印尼人民对争取民主与和平的日本人民的战斗行动致敬。苏洛多强调说，深痛的经验教训已使印尼人民对美帝国主义企图把他们拖入备战集团里去的一切阴谋与活动，更加警惕了。印尼人民拒绝一切危害和平的公约或协定。
    接着，印度代表、甘地的信徒、著名的慈善家和名诗人、六十七岁的和平战士拉维·山加尔·史佛兰姆·维亚斯上台发言。他说：所有的印度人民是爱好和平憎恨战争的，全世界的群众是渴望和平的，但是和平不会从天上掉下来，要努力争取它。他说：一切侵略必须抵抗。拿我个人来讲，我认为非暴力的抵抗是最好的抵抗方法，不过，认为这是不实际的或不可能的人们，也没有理由甘心做懦夫。所以，我完全同情那些在朝鲜、马来亚和越南英勇地反抗侵略、保卫民族光荣和独立的人们。这位老人愤慨地说：朝鲜所遭受的灾害，特别使我心里充满对侵略者的愤恨。因此我们必须形成一种全世界的舆论，迫使美国政府撤退它的军队，那时中国人民志愿军才可能没有必要继续留在朝鲜国土上。他说：全世界各国人民都应该尽全力抵抗那些企图剥夺他们集体劳动果实的人，我们才能为世界持久和平奠定真正的基础。这位虔诚信奉甘地主义的老人所说出的善良而坚决的语言，曾一再被热烈的鼓掌所打断。
    这时，会议厅内出现了令人难忘的场面。在雷动的掌声中大会副秘书长、美国代表团团长路易士·惠吞宣读了印度和巴基斯坦两国代表团经过协商后发表的联合声明（全文另发），这个声明向亚洲及太平洋各国的代表们庄重地表明了印度和巴基斯坦两国人民的兄弟友爱的愿望。接着，以印度代表团团长、全印和平理事会主席克其鲁为首的四个印度代表，和以巴基斯坦代表团团长、著名回教领袖沙里夫为首的四个巴基斯坦代表，在欢呼声、掌声和音乐声交作中，在来自四十多个国家的和平战士四百多人的亲切注视下，走上主席台在声明上庄严地签字。签字时，台下的两国代表互相走到对方的席次上，投掷象征友好和幸福的鲜花。签字后，在主席台上的两国代表互相戴上表示兄弟友爱的花环，并互相献赠礼物。印度代表赠给巴基斯坦代表以克什米尔出产的漆盒，和绣有颐和园风景的丝织品，以纪念使得这一聚会和两国代表共同发表声明成为可能的所在地——北京。巴基斯坦代表团长沙里夫赠给印度代表团长克其鲁以绣金的帽子（按照旁遮普的习俗，人们结成兄弟时互赠帽子），并赠给印度代表团以北京出产的有雕刻的木盒，以纪念这次盛会。赠礼后，两国代表热情地长时间地拥抱在一起。紧接着，克其鲁和沙里夫共同把签了字的声明，和用乌尔都文、中文、英文三种文字绣着“世界和平万岁”的锦旗一面，献给大会执行主席郭沫若，并给郭沫若戴上花环，会场欢声雷动。随后两国代表亲密地挽手并肩走下主席台。两国代表都走到对方的席次上，握手拥抱，热烈祝贺印巴两国人民和平友爱的这一良好的重大发端。两国代表团中的好几位代表被欢呼的人群高高地举起来。这种感人的真挚的兄弟友爱的情景，使不少代表们感动得流泪。全场起立为之忘情地鼓掌欢呼达十数分钟。
    郭沫若接着起立讲话，他说：“我以大会执行主席的名义，对印度和巴基斯坦两国代表团的联合声明，表示热烈欢迎。我相信，这个联合声明中所表现的善意与友好的协商态度及其自谋解决的精神，对于久悬未决的克什米尔问题的解决，定将有所裨益。我建议将这个联合声明列入大会记录。”
    这时，渐趋平静的会场，又重新爆发欢呼声和掌声，表示大会对这个建议的欢迎和支持。
    来自巴西的特邀代表、医生和里约热内卢大学教授马里奥·费比奥接着上台发言。他痛斥美国政府强迫巴西签订奴役的双边军事协定的行为。他说强迫签订这个协定的企图在拉丁美洲各国已引起了强烈的愤怒和抗议，在巴西，斗争的浪潮正愈来愈高涨。一个反对军事协定的全国性的阵线已经成立了。他指出：不管国会是否会批准这个协定，决不会有一个巴西陆军或海军的士兵去攻击他的朝鲜兄弟们，因为巴西人民根本反对这个丑恶的战争。
    最后，副秘书长惠吞宣布大会收到许多国家的团体和个人发来的贺电。
    大会在下午一时四十分休会。
