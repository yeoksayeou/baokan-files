Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 21st: American invading army commander Clark has rejected the resumption of armistice negotiations that Harrison suspended thirteen days ago.

In his reply on October 19th to Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai, Clark resolutely declared his refusal to resume armistice negotiations as suggested by Generals Kim and Peng, even though he knew that the suggestion of Generals Kim and Peng fully represented the urgent desires of peace-loving people all over the world.

Just as the US military shelled the Panmunjom conference area when Harrison announced an indefinite adjournment to suspend negotiations on October 8th, on the very day that Clark rejected the resumption of negotiations with his reply, the US side once again provoked by firing into the airspace over the Panmunjom conference area. Obviously, Clark was afraid that others would not believe that they were deliberately sabotaging the armistice negotiations.

Clark closed the door to negotiations even tighter. He insisted on absolutely disagreeing with the provisions of the Geneva Convention and was unwilling to negotiate again based on the provisions of the Geneva Convention. Clark's statement threw away the pretense of the three optional suggestions made by Harrison, and simply turned the three suggestions into one unreasonable demand, preventing prisoners of war from returning home. Clark also re-proposed the barbaric condition: only by accepting, and also accepting in writing, the "aide-mémoire" proposed by the US side to detain prisoners of war, could negotiations be resumed. This further increased the severity of the provocation. Clark knew that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army could not accept this point, so he could be sure that the interrupted negotiations could not be resumed.

Clark quibbled, saying: "The United Nations Command has not interrupted the armistice negotiations." But Clark's weak defense cannot hide the ironclad facts. Harrison interrupted the negotiations, and Clark refused to resume them. Clark rejected the suggestion made by General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai to reach a ceasefire through negotiations. Clark refused to negotiate based on the Geneva Convention, which was signed by sixty-two countries. He refused to repatriate all prisoners of war in accordance with the provisions of the draft armistice agreement agreed upon by both sides, allowing them to return home to live peaceful lives.

From Acheson's speech at the United Nations General Assembly, the motives for Clark's actions can be found. Acheson hoped to eliminate the "timidity" of the United States' satellite states in order to continue and expand the war. Therefore, based on a desperate attempt, they planned to cut off the retreat of those "allies" who reluctantly obeyed it, and drag them deeper into the abyss of war.

A dispatch from the Associated Press correspondent at the United Nations on October 20th confirmed this. The dispatch said: "The United States is preparing to conduct a 'vigorous campaign' in order to obtain more troops from the United Nations member states to invest in the Korean battlefield." US Assistant Secretary of State Hickerson, in a speech to the American Association for the United Nations, openly wanted to make the United States' satellite states carry out a larger-scale, protracted war in Korea. He openly said: "We intend to strive in the United Nations General Assembly to make as many United Nations member states as possible who have not yet taken responsibility take their responsibilities in Korea. There should be more troops in Korea prepared to continue fighting for as long as it takes."

The people of the world must pay serious attention and be doubly vigilant to the American aggressors' conspiracy to drive their "allies" to contribute more money and people to continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea for the benefit of the United States.

### 克拉克断然拒绝金日成彭德怀两将军建议坚持中断谈判以便迫使仆从国家扩大战争

    克拉克断然拒绝金日成彭德怀两将军建议坚持中断谈判以便迫使仆从国家扩大战争
    【新华社开城二十一日电】美国侵朝军总司令克拉克已经拒绝恢复哈利逊在十三天以前所中断的停战谈判。
    克拉克在其十月十九日对于金日成将军与彭德怀将军的复信中，断然声明拒绝金、彭两将军要求恢复停战谈判的建议，虽然他明知金、彭两将军的建议是完全代表全世界爱好和平人民的迫切的愿望的。
    正如哈利逊在十月八日宣布无限期休会以中止谈判时美军向板门店会场区开炮一样，在克拉克以复函拒绝恢复谈判的当天，美方竟然再度挑衅，向板门店会场区上空采取开炮行为。显然地，克拉克是惟恐别人不相信他们是蓄意破坏停战谈判的。
    克拉克把谈判的大门关得更死。他坚持绝不同意日内瓦公约的规定，也不愿意根据日内瓦公约的规定再行谈判。克拉克的声明抛去了哈利逊所提的三项任择其一的建议的花样，干脆把三项建议变为一项无理要求，不让战俘回家。克拉克还重新提出蛮横的条件：只有接受，并且还要以书面方式接受美方所提扣留战俘的哀的美敦书才能恢复谈判，这就格外增加了挑衅的严重性。克拉克明知朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军是不能接受这一点的，这样，他可以拿稳中断的谈判不能恢复。
    克拉克诡辩说：“联合国军方面并没有中断停战谈判。”但是克拉克这种无力的辩解掩盖不了铁的事实。哈利逊中断了谈判，而克拉克则拒绝恢复谈判。克拉克拒绝了金日成将军和彭德怀将军所提出的通过谈判达成停战的建议。克拉克拒绝以六十二个国家签字的日内瓦公约为基础进行谈判。他拒绝了按照双方同意的停战协定草案的规定遣返全部战俘，让他们回家过和平生活。
    从艾奇逊在联合国大会上发表的演说中，可以找出克拉克所采取的行动的动机。艾奇逊希望消除美国仆从国家的“胆小怕事”，以便继续和扩大战争。因此他们根据一种不顾死活的企图，打算断绝那些勉强服从它的“盟国”的退路，并把它们更深地拖入战争的深渊。
    美联社驻联合国记者于十月二十日发出的一条电讯证实了这一点。这条电讯说：“美国正准备进行一次‘有力的运动’，以便从联合国会员国获得更多的军队投入朝鲜战场。”美国助理国务卿希克逊在对美国联合国同志会所发表的演说中，公然要使美国仆从国家在朝鲜进行一次更为大规模的持久战。他公然说道：“我们打算在联合国大会中力求使尽量多的还未负起责任的联合国会员国负起它们在朝鲜的责任。目前在朝鲜应有更多的军队准备继续作战，需要作战多久就作战多久。”
    对于美国侵略者这种企图驱使其“盟国”更多地出钱出人为美国的利益继续和扩大侵朝战争的阴谋，全世界人民必须予以严重注意和加倍警惕。
