Our National Defense Army is also a Production Army
——Great Achievements of the People's Liberation Army Stationed in Xinjiang on the Economic Front in the Past Three Years
Xinjiang Military Region Political Department Propaganda Department News Group

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, in carrying out the glorious task of "defending the motherland and building the motherland," has demonstrated revolutionary heroism and, without hindering military tasks, has worked selflessly for the past three years, achieving brilliant victories.

**Reclaimed 1.67 Million Mu of Farmland, with Successive Years of Bountiful Harvests of Various Crops**

In terms of agricultural production, since arriving in Xinjiang in the winter of 1949, the troops stationed in Xinjiang have entered production areas and persisted in production labor under conditions of "sleeping in the open and enduring severe cold and heat." Over the past three years, they have gradually overcome numerous difficulties and reclaimed large areas of arable land on the desolate ancient wilderness of the Tianshan Mountains. As of 1952, the area cultivated by the troops has reached 1.67 million mu, an increase of 70 percent compared to the cultivated area in 1950. It is estimated that 60,000 tons of wheat, 40,000 tons of rice, 50,000 tons of miscellaneous grains, 3,000 tons of cotton, and 70,000 tons of oilseeds, melons, and vegetables can be harvested. The total harvest is double that of 1951. They have not only improved the lives of the troops but also created huge wealth for the country and created preliminary conditions for the future development of Xinjiang's industry.

In agricultural production, the troops stationed in Xinjiang have widely used Soviet agricultural machinery, advanced farm implements, and improved crop varieties. As of 1952, they have basically ceased using backward production tools such as hoes and earthen plows. Since 1951, four mechanized farms with modern equipment have been established in areas such as Dihua, Suilai, and Yanqi, with a total cultivated area of 74,000 mu. In addition, the general agricultural production troops have been able to skillfully use various new Soviet agricultural machines. During the summer harvest of 1952, the use of horse-drawn harvesters to harvest wheat generally exceeded the standard of 80 mu in ten hours, reaching a maximum of 135 mu, giving full play to the efficiency of the machinery. In terms of selecting improved varieties, the Xinjiang Military Region alone distributed 300 tons of Schneider and S-3173 improved cotton seeds to the troops in the spring of 1952, and it is estimated that the cotton yield per mu in 1952 will reach 40 jin of lint cotton. At the same time, the troops also learned from the advanced farming methods of the Soviet Union and the experience of famous national model farmers, implementing intensive cultivation and scientific field management, which significantly increased the yield per unit area in 1952. The Qiang character troops engaged in production in the Kaidu River Reclamation Area planted 40,000 mu of wheat, with an average yield of over 260 jin per mu, double that of 1951. The Ma Deru group of this unit had 10.78 mu of high-yield land, with an average yield of 1377 jin and 11 liang of winter wheat per mu; the Wang Bosheng group had 4.04 mu of high-yield land, with an average yield of 1057 jin and 6 liang per mu. These two high-yield groups created new national records for the yield per unit area of winter wheat and spring wheat in 1952, fully demonstrating the great potential of agricultural production in New China and the superiority of our army's collective labor and scientific cultivation. Other reasons for the bountiful harvest of agricultural products are that the production troops generally attached importance to accumulating and applying fertilizer. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu in 1952 increased by more than double that of 1951; the implementation of a crop rotation system of grazing land combined with animal husbandry played a significant role in improving the soil, increasing soil fertility, preventing and controlling diseases and pests, and reducing weeds; in particular, the troops strengthened organizational leadership in production, implemented a quota system and a production responsibility system, divided labor and cooperated closely, giving full play to the efficiency of machinery and improving labor efficiency. A certain company of the Jian character troops completed the task of cultivating and planting 3314 mu in 1952, doubling the planting area compared to 1951, and meeting the requirements of intensive cultivation.

Over the past three years, the troops have provided great assistance to local farmers of all ethnic groups in terms of land, livestock, tools, seeds, and grain. People of all ethnic groups in various places have adopted the advanced methods and production experience of intensive cultivation from the troops. Areas that were previously considered unsuitable for growing cotton and winter wheat have also begun to plant cotton and winter wheat this year. The farmers of all ethnic groups in the Yanqi Special District have accepted the advanced experience of Ma Deru, a high-yield expert in winter wheat from the Qiang character troops, and plan to plant 100,000 mu of winter wheat this autumn. In the spring of 1951, the troops helped the Dihua Municipal People's Government establish Xinjiang's first collective farm, the Dihua Collective Farm. Now this collective farm has 500 households of farmers of all ethnic groups, with a cultivated area of over 10,000 mu.

**Constructed Nearly 300 Canals of Various Sizes, Increasing Irrigated Farmland by More Than 2 Million Mu**

Xinjiang has a dry climate and little rainfall. "Where there is water, there is land; where there is no water, there is no field" is the most popular saying among farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Therefore, developing water conservancy construction has become a prerequisite for developing agricultural and animal husbandry production. When the troops began agricultural production, they attached great importance to water conservancy construction. Over the past three years, they have newly built and repaired nearly 300 canals of various sizes north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, with a total length of more than 2,300 kilometers, excavating and filling more than 13 million cubic meters of earthwork, increasing the irrigated area by more than 2 million mu. From the summer of 1950 to the spring of 1951, they successively carried out water conservancy surveys, measurements, and designs in Dihua, Yanqi, Hami, Aksu, Suilai, Tielimu, and other places, and began modern water conservancy engineering construction. As of the autumn of 1952, the Hami Red Star No. 1 Canal, the Yanqi Liberation Canal, the Korla 18th Regiment Canal, and the Dihua Red Goose Pond Reservoir have been completed and released water, providing timely irrigation to hundreds of thousands of mu of farmland. Currently, the modern permanent water conservancy projects under construction include: the West Bank Canal and Mushroom Lake Reservoir in the middle reaches of the Manas River, the East Canal in the middle reaches of the Manas River, the Gongliu Consolidation Canal, the Hami Red Star No. 2 Canal, the Yanqi Liberation No. 2 Canal, the Aksu Victory Canal, the Dihua "May 1st" Reservoir, and the Dihua Mengjin Reservoir. After the completion of these modern water conservancy projects, the irrigated area will be over 100,000 mu each. Among them, the West Bank Canal and Mushroom Lake Reservoir in the middle reaches of the Manas River are larger in scale. The canal is 125 kilometers long and is expected to irrigate 2 million mu of farmland and 3 million mu of sandy wasteland forest area; the Mushroom Lake Reservoir connected to the West Bank Canal has a storage capacity of approximately 100 million cubic meters. These two modern water conservancy projects are planned to be completed within four years.

Over the past three years, the tremendous achievements of the troops stationed in Xinjiang in water conservancy engineering have not only provided abundant water sources for the 1.67 million mu of land reclaimed by the troops but also allowed farmers of all ethnic groups to irrigate hundreds of thousands of mu of land. The construction of these water conservancy projects has not only expanded the cultivated area and increased the output of grain and industrial raw materials but also, due to the expansion of the oasis, can indirectly reduce floods in the original cultivated land and gradually reduce insect pests and wind damage. In order to change the natural conditions of Xinjiang and ensure agricultural harvests, the troops also attached importance to afforestation. Over the past three years, they have planted more than 4 million trees, with an average survival rate of 80 percent. This will play a significant role in maintaining soil and water, regulating the climate, preventing wind and sand, and developing agricultural and animal husbandry production.

**Implementing Crop Rotation System of Grazing Land, Animal Husbandry has Great Development**

Over the past three years, the troops stationed in Xinjiang have achieved great results in animal husbandry. According to preliminary statistics for the first half of 1952, the troops had more than 610,000 sheep, more than 37,000 pigs, more than 22,600 horses, more than 30,000 cattle, and more than 45,000 chickens and ducks (chickens and ducks were not counted in 1952). The average livestock and poultry breeding increased by 97 percent compared to the total number of breeding in 1950 and 1951. Among them, the breeding rate of sheep was the highest, exceeding 99 percent of the total number of sheep breeding in the two years of 1950 and 1951. In order to develop animal husbandry, the troops first implemented a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, adopted the advanced experience of Soviet grazing land crop rotation, and cultivated a large amount of pasture. According to statistics in 1952, the area of pasture has reached 330,000 mu, which not only supplies feed for the livestock but also gradually shifts from nomadic to settled grazing and from decentralized management to centralized management. Each pasture has also strengthened the allocation of animal husbandry personnel, implemented the veterinary policy of "prevention first," and reduced and prevented the spread of livestock diseases. In terms of improving varieties, the Lanka sheep breed was introduced, and the Soviet Ukrainian Large White pig was bred and promoted.

**Learning from Advanced Soviet Experience, Engineering Construction is Proceeding Smoothly**

In terms of engineering construction, according to incomplete statistics from 1951 to the first half of 1952, the troops stationed in Xinjiang built a total of 15,603 factories, schools, hospitals, and barracks, with an area of 247,716 square meters and a volume of 1,120,746 cubic meters. The total value of these buildings is more than 318.48 billion yuan. In addition to the actual expenditure (including labor and materials) of more than 157.009 billion yuan, the wealth created for the country is more than 161.388 billion yuan.

In completing the above projects, Soviet experts and engineers provided selfless assistance and patient guidance with a high degree of internationalism. The engineering personnel of the troops and the comrades who participated in the engineering construction were also able to humbly learn and promote the advanced experience in Soviet engineering construction, thus overcoming the difficulty of lacking engineering technical personnel. As of the end of 1951, the number of design personnel had increased fivefold, and more than 600 people had learned the technology of tying steel bars and mixing concrete. Over the past three years, the engineering construction troops have successively launched patriotic labor competitions with the content of creating inventions, learning from Soviet experience, improving work efficiency, and saving raw materials. According to incomplete statistics, 33 important inventions and new records emerged in the first half of 1952 alone. Among them, the Zhang Ba'er seven-person bricklaying team of the Bai character unit created a new record of laying 4,094 bricks per hour after learning the new Soviet bricklaying method. These inventions greatly improved work efficiency, with the lowest increasing by one time and the highest increasing by 60 times.

**Helping People of All Ethnic Groups Create a Happy Life, Industrial Construction has had a Victorious Start**

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang has also made a good start in Xinjiang's industrial construction. The funds for industrial construction are mostly accumulated by the troops stationed in Xinjiang through large-scale agricultural production and the frugality of all officers and soldiers. By the end of 1950, the People's Liberation Army had established 94 small textile, sewing, soap, and iron-wood factories, as well as 216 coal kilns and various workshops. In addition to expanding the existing small factories and mines in 1951, an open-pit coal mine with reserves of 2 billion metric tons was also developed. Currently, it is mined semi-manually, producing 400 tons of coal per day. In 1952, textile factories, cement factories, power plants, and steel plants all produced entirely by machines and have also successively started production. Basic construction projects such as flour mills, hydropower stations, and the expansion of existing factories and mines are now being actively built. The construction of these industries has played a significant role in improving Xinjiang's transportation, supplying the living and production materials of people of all ethnic groups, and especially in developing Xinjiang's farmland water conservancy construction. According to statistics in 1950 alone, various iron-wood factories produced more than 82,000 pieces of various agricultural tools; in 1952, they also manufactured a large number of new agricultural tools such as cultivators, seeders, and cotton gins, which were supplied to farmers of all ethnic groups through cooperatives and trading companies, solving their previous difficulties in lacking production tools. The steel bars and cement produced by steel plants and cement factories are now being used to build modern water conservancy projects. The construction of textile factories and open-pit coal mines has cheaply supplied fabrics and fuel to people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Taking the fabrics produced by textile factories as an example, the freight alone is 15 to 20 percent cheaper than transporting them from other places.

From January to July 1952, the Automobile Repair General Factory had 70 groups and workshops that created 174 new production records. The cost of various major products was reduced by 38.72 percent compared to 1951, increasing production for the country by 3.6 billion yuan.

**Transporting Materials and Equipment through the Gobi Desert, the Automobile Transportation Troops Played a Significant Role**

In terms of transportation, the automobile transportation troops traveled day and night on the plateau in the northwest of the motherland, constantly bringing the materials needed by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the equipment needed for production and construction. The transportation troops transported a large number of seeds and agricultural machinery from the Soviet Union, which greatly helped the development of Xinjiang's agriculture; they also transported more than 930 tons of newspapers, more than 520 tons of books in various ethnic languages, 150 tons of instruments, more than 70 tons of stationery, and more than 8 tons of musical instruments from all parts of our country and the Soviet Union. These cultural and educational materials and equipment created favorable conditions for the development of the cultural and educational undertakings of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. In carrying out these tasks, the automobile transportation troops overcame natural obstacles and the lack of equipment, and launched movements to cherish state property, implement quota management, improve vehicle turnover rate, and strive for safe driving. These people's drivers became stronger the more difficulties they encountered. In summer, they drove cars through the uninhabited Gobi Desert and the Qire region of Turpan, which is 300 meters below sea level. In winter, they braved the wind and snow, crossing Dapan Mountain, Tianshan Mountain, Alkin Mountain, and Kunlun Mountain. The road was submerged by snow, so they used iron shovels to clear it before proceeding. When passing through mud pits, snow nests, ice caves, and slurry areas, they took off their clothes and placed them on the ground to allow the trucks to pass safely. The long journey lacked car maintenance and repair equipment, so each company organized car repair and road repair teams, carrying tools to repair vehicles and repair damaged roads at any time, which greatly improved the vehicle transportation rate. They promoted the production responsibility system of three guarantees (guaranteed repair, guaranteed driving, and guaranteed safe driving) and four fasts (fast repair, fast transportation, fast loading, and fast unloading), and many model drivers who drove safely and extended the mileage between major repairs emerged. Sun Yucheng, a model driver, created a new record in 1951 of driving a GAS-51 car safely for 50,000 kilometers before replacing a set of valves (piston valves), and in 1952, he proposed a production increase competition to drivers of state-owned automobile companies across the country with the condition of extending the mileage between major repairs to 80,000 kilometers.

**Continue to Advance and Strive for Greater Victory**

Over the past three years, the brilliant victory of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang in economic construction proves that the people's army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong is not only a national defense army but also a production army. Now the troops stationed in Xinjiang are continuing to advance heroically on this victorious basis, not only safeguarding the security of the motherland's frontier but also completing the economic construction tasks entrusted to them by Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland.

    我们的国防军也是生产军
    ——驻新疆的人民解放军三年来在经济战线上的伟大成就
    新疆军区政治部宣传部新闻组
    驻新疆的人民解放军，在执行“保卫祖国、建设祖国”的光荣任务中，发扬革命的英雄主义，三年来在不妨碍军事任务的条件下，忘我地劳动，取得了光辉的胜利。
    开垦农田一百六十七万亩，各种农作物连年获得丰收
    在农业生产方面，驻新疆部队从一九四九年冬季到达新疆后，即进入生产地区，常年在“风餐露宿、严寒酷热”的环境下，坚持生产劳动。三年来，逐渐战胜了重重困难，在天山南北渺无人烟的古生荒地上，开垦出大片的可耕良田。截至一九五二年，部队垦播面积已达一百六十七万亩，较一九五零年的耕地面积扩大了百分之七十，预计可收小麦六万吨，水稻四万吨，杂粮五万吨，棉花三千吨，油籽、瓜、菜等七万吨。总计收获量较一九五一年增加一倍。他们不仅改善了部队的生活，而且为国家创造了巨额财富，并为今后发展新疆工业创造了初步条件。
    驻新疆部队在农业生产中，广泛使用了苏联农业机器、先进农具和优良的农作物品种。截至一九五二年，已基本上不再使用钁头、土犁等落后生产工具。一九五一年起，并分别在迪化、绥来、焉耆等地区建立了四个具有现代化设备的机械农场，耕地面积共有七万四千亩。此外，一般农业生产部队都已能熟练地使用苏联各种新式农业机器。一九五二年夏收中，使用马拉收割机收麦，普遍超过十小时收割八十亩的规定标准，最高达到一百三十五亩，充分发挥了机械效能。在选用优良品种方面，仅新疆军区一九五二年春季配发给部队的史乃得尔、斯三一七三优良棉种便有三百吨，预计一九五二年棉花产量每亩可达皮棉四十斤。同时，部队还学习了苏联先进的耕作法和全国著名丰产模范的经验，实行了精耕细作和科学的田间管理工作，使一九五二年的单位面积产量显著提高。在开都河垦区进行生产的强字部队所种四万亩小麦，每亩平均产量在二百六十斤以上，较一九五一年提高了一倍。该部马德如小组有十亩七分八厘丰产地，平均每亩丰产冬小麦一千三百七十七斤十一两；王伯生小组有四亩四厘丰产地，每亩平均丰产一千零五十七斤六两。这两个丰产小组，创造了一九五二年度全国冬小麦和春小麦单位面积产量的新纪录，充分显示了新中国农业生产的伟大潜力和我军集体劳动、科学耕作的优越性。农产品丰收的另一些原因，是生产部队普遍重视了积肥施肥。一九五二年每亩地的施肥量，较一九五一年增加了一倍以上；实行了农牧结合经营的牧草田轮作制，对改良土壤、增加地力、防除病虫害、减少杂草起了很大的作用；特别是部队在生产中加强组织领导，实行了定额制和生产责任制，分工合作，密切联系，充分发挥了机械效能与提高了劳动效率。坚字部队某连一九五二年完成了三千三百一十四亩的耕播任务，播种面积较一九五一年增加了一倍，并且合乎精耕细作的要求。
    三年来，部队在土地、牲畜、工具、种籽、粮食等方面给予当地各族农民以大力的援助。各地各族人民在耕作方法上接受了部队精耕细作的先进方法和生产经验，过去认为不能种棉花、冬麦的地方，今年也开始播种了棉花和冬麦。焉耆专区的各族农民，接受了强字部队冬小麦丰产能手马德如的先进经验，今秋计划播种冬麦十万亩。一九五一年春，部队帮助迪化市人民政府成立了新疆第一个集体农庄——迪化集体农庄。现在这个农庄拥有各族农民五百户，耕地面积在一万亩以上。
    兴修大小渠道近三百条，增灌农田二百万亩以上
    新疆气候干燥，雨量稀少。“有水就有地，无水即无田”，这是新疆各族农民中最流行的一句话。因此，发展水利建设，就成为发展农业牧业生产的先决条件。部队在开始进行农业生产的时候，就十分重视兴修水利。他们三年来在天山南北新修与补修的大小渠道近三百条，全长二千三百多公里，挖填土方一千三百多万立方，灌溉面积增加二百万亩以上。从一九五零年夏天起，到一九五一年春天，先后在迪化、焉耆、哈密、阿克苏、绥来、铁里木等地进行了水利勘察、测量、设计等工作，并着手进行现代化的水利工程建设。截至一九五二年秋季，哈密红星一渠、焉耆解放一渠、库尔勒十八团大渠、迪化红雁池蓄水库等均已先后竣工放水，使数十万亩农田及时得到灌溉。目前正在进行的现代化永久性水利工程计有：玛纳斯河中游西岸大渠和蘑菇湖蓄水库、玛纳斯河中游东渠大渠、巩留巩固大渠、哈密红星二渠、焉耆解放第二渠、阿克苏胜利大渠、迪化“五一”蓄水库、迪化猛进蓄水库等。这些现代化的水利工程完工之后，灌溉面积都各在十万亩以上。其中以玛纳斯河中游西岸大渠和蘑菇湖蓄水库工程规模较大，该渠全长一百二十五公里，预计灌溉农田二百万亩、沙荒林区三百万亩；与西岸大渠相连的蘑菇湖蓄水库，蓄水量约一亿立方。这两个现代化的水利工程计划在四年内完成。
    三年来，驻新疆部队在水利工程上的巨大成就，不仅使部队开垦的一百六十七万亩土地得到丰盛的水源，而且把灌溉数十万亩地的水量让给了各族农民。这些水利工程的兴修不仅扩大了耕地面积，增加了粮食和工业原料的产量，而且由于绿洲的扩大，可以间接地减少原有耕地的水灾和逐渐减少虫害和风害。为了改变新疆的自然条件，保证农业丰收，部队还重视了植树造林工作，三年来共植树四百多万株，成活率平均为百分之八十。这对于保持水土、调节气候、防风、防沙、发展农牧业生产，将起重大作用。
    实行牧草田轮作制，畜牧业有很大发展
    三年来，驻新疆部队在畜牧业方面取得了很大的成绩。据一九五二年上半年初步统计：部队共有羊六十一万多只，猪三万七千多口，马二万二千六百匹，牛三万多头，鸡鸭四万五千多只（一九五二年鸡鸭未计）。畜禽繁殖平均较一九五零年和一九五一年繁殖总数，增加了百分之九十七。其中羊的繁殖率最大，超过了一九五零年和一九五一年两年羊的繁殖总数的百分之九十九。部队为发展畜牧业，首先实行了农牧业相结合，采用苏联牧草田轮作的先进经验，大量栽培牧草。据一九五二年统计，牧草面积已有三十三万亩，不仅供给了畜群的饲料，而且逐渐由游牧走向定牧，由分散经营达到集中经营。各牧场又都加强了畜牧人员的配备，贯彻了“预防为主”的兽医方针，减少和制止了牲畜疾病的传染。在改良品种方面，引用了兰哈羊种，并繁殖和推广了苏联乌克兰大白猪。
    学习苏联先进经验，工程建设顺利进行
    在工程建设方面，仅就一九五一年至一九五二年上半年不完全的材料统计，驻新疆部队共兴建工厂、学校、医院、营房一万五千六百零三间，面积二十四万七千七百一十六平方公尺，体积一百一十二万零七百四十六立方公尺。这些建筑物总值三千一百八十四亿八千余万元，除实支（包括人工、材料）一千五百七十亿零九千余万元外，为国家创造财富一千六百一十三亿八千余万元。
    在完成上述工程中，苏联专家和工程师曾以高度的国际主义精神，给予无私的帮助和耐心的指导。部队的工程人员和参加工程建设的同志也能够虚心学习并推广苏联工程建设上的先进经验，从而克服了缺少工程技术人员的困难。截至一九五一年底，设计人员增加了五倍，并有六百多人学会了扎钢筋、合混凝土的技术。三年来，各工程建设部队，曾先后掀起以创造发明、学习苏联经验、提高工作效率、节省原材料为内容的爱国主义劳动竞赛。据不完全的材料统计，一九五二年上半年即涌现重要的创造发明、新纪录三十三种。其中白字部张罢儿七人砌砖小组在学习了苏联新砌砖法后，创造了每小时砌砖四千零九十四块的新纪录。这些创造发明，大大提高了工作效率，其中最低的提高了一倍，最高的提高到六十倍。
    帮助各族人民创造幸福生活，工业建设已经有了胜利的开端
    驻新疆人民解放军在新疆的工业建设方面，也作了良好开端。工业建设的资金，大部分是驻新疆部队展开大规模农业生产和全体指战员节衣缩食积累下来的。至一九五零年底，解放军已经建立了小型纺织、缝纫、肥皂以及铁木工厂九十四个，煤窑和各种作坊二百一十六处。一九五一年除扩大已有的小型工厂、矿场外，又开发出蕴藏二十亿公吨的露天煤矿一处。目前用半人工开采，日产燃煤四百吨。一九五二年，全部以机器生产的纺织厂、水泥厂、发电厂、钢铁厂也已先后开工生产。现在正积极建设面粉厂、水力发电站及扩大原有工厂、矿场等的基本建设工程。这些工业的兴建，对改善新疆的交通运输，供给各族人民的生活资料和生产资料，特别是对发展新疆农田水利的建设起了很大的作用。仅就一九五零年的统计，各铁木工厂就生产出各种农具八万二千余件；一九五二年又制出大批新式农具如中耕器、播种机、轧花机等，通过合作社和贸易公司供给各族农民，解决了他们以前缺少生产工具的困难。钢铁厂、水泥厂生产的钢筋、水泥，现已用于建设现代化的水利工程上了。纺织厂和露天煤矿的兴建，廉价供给了新疆各族人民布匹和燃料。拿纺织厂出产的布匹来说，仅运费一项，就比以前从外地运来便宜百分之十五到二十。
    汽车修理总厂在一九五二年一至七月，有七十个小组、车间创造了一百七十四次生产新纪录。各种主要产品的成本，比一九五一年降低了百分之三十八点七二，为国家增产三十六亿元。
    通过戈壁运输物资器材，汽车运输部队起了很大作用
    在运输工作方面，汽车运输部队日日夜夜奔驰在祖国西北的高原上，不断地带给新疆各族人民所需要的物资，及生产建设中所需要的器材。运输部队从苏联运进大批籽种和农业机器，对于新疆农业的发展有很大的帮助；又从我国各地和苏联运进九百三十余吨报纸、五百二十余吨各民族文字的图书、一百五十吨仪器、七十余吨文具、八吨多乐器，这些文教物资器材，给新疆各族人民的文化教育事业的发展创造了有利条件。汽车运输部队在执行这些任务时，克服天然险阻与缺乏器材的困难，展开了爱护国家财产、执行定额管理、提高车辆运转率及争取安全行车等运动。这些人民的驾驶员越碰到困难越显得坚强。夏天，他们驾驶汽车通过无人烟的戈壁沙漠和低于海面三百公尺的奇热地区吐鲁番。冬季，他们冒着急风大雪，翻越大盘山、天山、阿尔金山、昆仑山。路迹被雪淹没了，用铁铣铲开再走，路过泥坑、雪窝、冰穴和泛浆地带时，就脱下衣服垫在地上让卡车安全通过。漫长的路途上缺乏护车和修车的设备，各个连队都组织了修车、修路小组，带着工具，在路上随时修理车辆，修补被毁坏的公路，使车辆运输率大大提高。他们推行三保（保修、保开、保证安全行驶）、四快（快修、快运、快装、快卸）的生产责任制，涌现了很多安全行车和延长大修里程的模范驾驶员。模范驾驶员孙玉成驾驶的嘎斯五一型汽车，一九五一年创造了安全行车五万公里才换一次令（活塞阀）的新纪录，并于一九五二年以延长大修里程八万公里的条件，向全国国营汽车公司驾驶员提出增产竞赛。
    继续前进，争取更大的胜利
    三年来，驻新疆的人民解放军在经济建设上的光辉胜利，证明在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛泽东主席领导下的人民军队，不仅是一支国防军，而且是一支生产军。现在驻新疆部队正在这一胜利的基础上，继续英勇前进，不仅保卫祖国边疆的安全，并完成毛主席和祖国人民赋予他们的经济建设任务。
