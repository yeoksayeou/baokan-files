    First of all, we, on behalf of the peace-loving Indonesian nation and the Indonesian people, pay tribute to all peace fighters in the world, especially our staunch peace comrades in Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and Malaya. We would also like to extend our highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to the people of New China and their leaders for initiating and carrying out the work of this peace conference.
    As everyone knows, the Indonesian people suffered severely during the last war, especially during the Japanese occupation. The brutality of Japanese militarism is still fresh in the minds of the Indonesian people. Not only were property and food devastated, but the people were also slaughtered. Approximately two million Indonesians were sent abroad to serve as laborers, and tens of thousands of them have not yet returned to their homes. These laborers left behind three million widows and orphans. During the reign of Japanese militarism, farmers' rice was seized, and workers' wages were withheld, so that they lived an inhuman life below the lowest human living standards. Hunger was widespread in Indonesia. Diseases were also occurring and spreading.
    Under this oppression and brutality, the people had already demonstrated the heroic spirit of resisting Japanese militarism. At that time, the people's resistance burned in every part of Indonesia. Therefore, the Indonesian people must oppose Japanese militarization and the San Francisco Treaty by which American imperialism uses Japan as a tool of aggression.
    We, on behalf of the Indonesian people, express our sympathy to the Japanese people who sacrificed themselves because of the conspiracy of American imperialism, and pay tribute to all the fighting actions of the Japanese people for democracy and peace.
    The armed aggression against the Korean people has clearly caused not only the suffering of the Korean people, but also the suffering of the Indonesian people. The cunning American imperialism manipulates the United Nations and forces embargoes and economic blockades against people's democratic countries. As a result, Indonesia can no longer engage in free import and export trade, which makes the lives of the Indonesian people increasingly degraded, many national entrepreneurs go bankrupt, and agriculture is also devastated. More than nine million farmers (or, to be precise, nine million households, 65 million people) own an average of only 0.84 hectares of land per person, and more and more Indonesian farmers are homeless.
    A worker's monthly salary is only enough for ten days of food on average. The number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. If the number of semi-unemployed people (i.e., seasonal workers who only work four months a year) is included, the number of unemployed people in Indonesia has reached about three million, and if family members are included, it is more than fifteen million. Due to poverty and the evil consequences of the war policy, the number of deaths is increasing day by day. The number of women who die each year is about 50,000, and the number of children is about 600,000.
    This is a brief account of the current suffering of the Indonesian people, which is caused by American imperialism's aggression in Korea and its war preparations in the Pacific. However, the above painful lessons have also made the people more vigilant against all the conspiracies and activities of American imperialism to drag the Indonesian people into its war preparation group. The Indonesian people's rejection of the San Francisco Treaty and the Common Security Act, as well as the rejection of Philippine President Quirino's visit to Indonesia, can prove the vigilance of the Indonesian people.
    The people's vigilance guarantees that any covenants or agreements that endanger peace will be rejected and opposed by the people.
    Therefore, for the sake of peace and humanity, based on the analysis and conclusions of the thematic reports on each issue that has been presented at the conference, we fully agree to solve all the problems facing this conference. (Xinhua News Agency)

    印度尼西亚代表团团长
    苏洛多的发言（摘要）
    我们首先代表爱好和平的印尼民族与印尼人民向全世界的和平战士，首先是朝鲜、日本、越南与马来亚的坚强的和平战友们致敬。我们还要对新中国的人民和他们的领导者们对于这个和平会议的发起和进行的工作致以最崇高的敬意与衷心的感谢。
    像大家知道的，印尼人民在上次大战中，尤其是在日本占领时期，遭遇了严重的苦难。日本军国主义的凶残，在印尼人民的心中记忆犹新。不但财产与粮食等等遭到浩劫，而且人民还横遭杀戮。大约有二百万印尼人被送到国外去充当劳役者，到现在还有成千成万的人没有回到他们的家园。这些劳役者遗下三百万寡妇和孤儿。在日本军国主义统治期间，农民的稻谷被夺去，工人的工资被扣压，以致他们过着比人类最低生活水平还低的非人生活。饥饿在印尼广泛流行。疾病也在发生和蔓延。
    在这种压迫与残暴之下，人民当时已经表现了反抗日本军国主义的英勇精神，当时人民的反抗燃烧了印尼每一个地方，因此，印尼人民一定反对日本军事化，反对美帝国主义利用日本作为侵略工具的旧金山条约。
    我们代表印尼人民对因美帝国主义的阴谋而牺牲的日本人民表示同情，并向为了争取民主与和平的日本人民的一切战斗的行动致敬。
    对朝鲜人民的武装侵略，很显然的，不只是造成朝鲜人民的困苦，也造成印尼人民的困苦。狡猾的美帝国主义操纵联合国，强迫对人民民主国家进行禁运与经济封锁。结果，印尼再也不能进行自由的进出口贸易，使得印尼人民的生活日愈下降，许多民族企业家破产，农业也受到摧残，九百万以上的农民（或者正确地说，九百万户，六千五百万的人口）平均每人不过占有土地零点八四公顷，越来越多的印尼农民无家可归。
    工人一个月的工资平均只够十天的伙食。失业的人数日益增加。若是把半失业的人数（即季节工人，一年只作四个月工）统计在内，印尼失业人数已达到三百万人左右，如果包括家属在内则有一千五百余万人。由于贫困和战争政策的恶果。死亡的人数日益增加，妇女的死亡每年达五万人左右，儿童六十万左右。
    这就是目前印尼人民困苦的简单叙述，这种困苦就是美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略与在太平洋所进行的备战所造成的。但是，上述深痛的经验教训，也使得人民对美帝国主义想把印尼人民拖入它的备战集团里去的一切阴谋与活动更加警惕了。印尼人民拒绝旧金山条约和共同安全法，以及拒绝菲律宾总统季里诺访问印尼，都可以证明印尼人民的这种警惕性。
    人民的这种警惕性保证了凡是危害和平的公约或协定都要受到人民的拒绝与反对。
    因此，为了和平和人道，根据已经在会议上提出的每一个问题的专题报告的分析及结论，我们完全同意解决这次会议面临的一切问题。（新华社）
