Dear fellow delegates:

On October 8th, as we, representatives from the Asian and Pacific regions representing 1.6 billion people, were here discussing the struggle for and defense of peace in order to eliminate war, the American negotiators in Korea took resolute action at Panmunjom to sabotage the armistice negotiations. Completely disregarding our reasonable new proposal, they unilaterally announced an indefinite adjournment of the armistice negotiations, and without waiting for our representatives to speak, they left the venue and arbitrarily suspended the armistice talks.

Dear friends, this unreasonable action by the American aggressors is completely hostile to the world people's desire for peace, and it is an open manifestation of the American conspiracy to deliberately delay and undermine the Korean armistice negotiations in order to expand the war.

As everyone knows, on September 28th, the American aggressors put forward three suggestions in which they insisted on detaining prisoners of war, and in these three suggestions, they insisted that so-called "anti-repatriation" prisoners of war from our side should not be repatriated. Therefore, the American proposals were completely unacceptable. However, in order to end the Korean War and quickly satisfy the world's people's desire for a Korean armistice, our side, in its new proposal on October 8th, based on the solemn principle that all prisoners of war must be repatriated, and adopted formal changes in the American proposal, that is, all prisoners of war should first be sent to the demilitarized zone for transfer to the other side, in order to complete the initial release procedures, rather than immediately repatriating all of them. Our side also stipulated that joint teams of the Red Cross societies of both sides could visit prisoners of war in the demilitarized zone and publicize the agreed principles of guaranteeing that prisoners of war could return home to live peaceful lives and no longer participate in the Korean War, and then classify them according to the principles of nationality and region proposed by our side. All captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the United Nations forces must be repatriated home; captured personnel of the Korean People's Army whose homes are in North Korea must be repatriated home, and those whose homes are in South Korea may return to South Korea; captured personnel of the South Korean army whose homes are in South Korea must be repatriated home, and those whose homes are in North Korea may return to North Korea. At the same time, neutral nations' inspection teams should be present to observe the visits, classification, and repatriation work. Our clearly reasonable proposal not only complied with the provisions and spirit of the Geneva Convention and the armistice agreement, but also adopted some of the American suggestions, and made many of the above-mentioned arrangements in terms of method to dispel American concerns. Any country that sincerely wants to stop the war cannot but sit down and consult with us on this proposal in terms of method.

However, what the American handful of warmongers are pursuing is not stopping the war, but expanding the war. They decided in advance that regardless of any proposals made by our side, as long as our side did not accept their unreasonable demand to detain prisoners of war, they would refuse to negotiate and sabotage the negotiations. They attempted to use this to threaten our side, and attempted to use the closure of the armistice negotiations to pressure the upcoming United Nations General Assembly to support their heinous claims of detaining prisoners of war and expanding the war. Therefore, the American side should bear full responsibility for sabotaging the negotiations and the consequences arising from sabotaging the negotiations.

Friends, in the face of this dangerous destructive action by the American aggressors, our task of fighting for peace and defending peace is even more urgent and important. We must further unite closely with a thousand times more effort than in the past, mobilize the people to demand that the American aggressors immediately stop their actions to sabotage the armistice negotiations, and carry out tireless and resolute struggle for a Korean armistice and for the lifting of the threat of war suffered by every family in the world and by our children, and we will never stop until we achieve our goal.

### 在十二日亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议主席团会议上  朝鲜代表团团长韩雪野关于朝鲜问题的声明

    在十二日亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议主席团会议上
    朝鲜代表团团长韩雪野关于朝鲜问题的声明亲爱的代表先生们：
    十月八日这一天，当我们来自亚洲及太平洋区域，代表十六万万人民的代表们正在这里讨论争取并保卫和平以便消除战争的时候，美国在朝鲜的谈判代表竟在板门店采取了断然破坏停战谈判的行动。他们完全无视了我方合理的新提案，片面宣布停战谈判无限期休会，并不等我方代表发言，就离开了会场，独断地中止了停战谈判。
    亲爱的朋友们，美国侵略者这一无理行动完全是与世界人民的和平愿望为敌的，它是美国有计划地拖延并破坏朝鲜停战谈判以便扩大战争的阴谋的公开表现。
    大家知道，美国侵略者在九月二十八日曾经提出了他们坚持扣留战俘的三个建议，在这三个建议里，他们坚持将所谓“反对遣返”的我方战俘不予遣返。因此，美方的建议是完全不能接受的。但是，为了结束朝鲜战争以迅速满足全世界人民对朝鲜停战的渴望，我方在十月八日的新提案中，根据战俘必须全部遣返的庄严原则，并采纳了美方建议中的形式上的变动，即将全部战俘首先送至非军事区交由对方接管，以完成初步释放的手续，而不是立即全部遣返。我方并规定了双方红十字会联合小组得以在非军事区访问战俘、宣扬已经协议的保证战俘回家过和平生活、不再参加朝鲜战争的原则，然后根据我方所提的按照国籍、地区分类的原则进行分类，凡中国人民志愿军与联合国军的被俘人员，必须全部遣返回家；朝鲜人民军被俘人员其家在北朝鲜者必须全部遣返回家，其家在南朝鲜者可以返回南朝鲜；南朝鲜军被俘人员，其家在南朝鲜者必须全部遣返回家，其家在北朝鲜者可以返回北朝鲜。同时，中立国视察小组并要对访问、分类、遣返等工作在场观察。我们这个明显合理的建议既遵守了日内瓦公约和停战协定的条文和精神，又采纳了美方的部分意见，并为解除美方的顾虑而作了上述方法上的许多安排。任何国家只要真心要求停止战争，是不能不坐下来就这个建议和我们进行方法上的协商的。
    可是，美国一小撮好战分子所追求的并不是停止战争，而是扩大战争。他们事先有计划地决定了不顾我方所作的任何建议，只要我方不接受他们的扣留战俘的无理主张，他们就拒绝协商，破坏谈判。他们企图借此对我方进行威胁，并企图用关闭停战谈判之门来压迫即将召开的联合国大会支持他们扣留战俘和扩大战争的罪恶主张。因此，美国方面对破坏谈判以及破坏谈判所引起的后果，应负完全的责任。
    朋友们，面对着美国侵略者这一危险的破坏行动，我们争取和平、保卫和平的任务是更加迫切，更加重大了。我们必须进一步以千百倍于往昔的努力来紧密团结，动员人民要求美国侵略者立即停止其破坏停战谈判的行动，并为争取朝鲜停战，为解除全世界每个家庭、我们每个人的儿女所遭受的战争威胁而进行不疲倦的坚决斗争，不达目的，决不休止。                        （新华社）
