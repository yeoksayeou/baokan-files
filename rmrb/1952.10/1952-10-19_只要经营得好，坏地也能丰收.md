    Barren Land Can Yield a Bumper Harvest If Managed Well

    Comrade Editor:
    Laozhushan Township, Eleventh District, Hanshou County, Hunan Province, is a mountainous area with barren soil. During the land reform, peasant Liu Xichu was allocated 15.5 mu of sticky clay paddy fields. Last year, these fields yielded an average of 500 jin of grain per mu. This year, the mid-season rice planted generally yielded more than 100 jin per mu compared to last year. Among them, 1.2 mu of high-yield fields yielded a total of 905 jin per mu (local average farmers can only harvest 200-300 jin per mu). The reason for Liu Xichu's bumper harvest of mid-season rice this year is that he participated in a mutual aid team, which solved various difficulties in production; he improved the soil and improved farming techniques. His high-yield fields were ploughed six inches deep, and more than 230 dan of mixed base fertilizer such as green manure, animal manure, and human manure were applied. When turning the mud, another 30 dan of green grass fertilizer was applied. After transplanting the seedlings, three topdressings were applied in stages, totaling 280 jin of bone meal, soybean cake, tea seed cake, and lime, and nine dan of wood ash. In addition, he also selected the excellent variety "Victory Xian," made suitable seedling fields, and promptly eliminated pests. Liu Xichu's experience proves that as long as attention is paid to improving the soil and improving technology, barren land can also yield a bumper harvest. Now, local farmers are learning from his high-yield experience.

    只要经营得好，坏地也能丰收
    编辑同志：湖南汉寿县十一区老竹山乡是个山区，土质硗瘠。翻身农民刘锡初在土地改革时分到十五亩五分黏泥田，这些田去年平均每亩收谷五百斤，今年种的中稻，每亩一般比去年多收一百多斤，其中一亩二分丰产田，每亩合计收获九百零五斤
    （当地一般农民每亩只能收二、三百斤）。刘锡初今年中稻丰收，是因为他参加了互助组，解决了生产上的各种困难；改良了土壤和提高了耕作技术。他的丰产田耕了六寸深，上了二百三十多担绿肥、牲口粪、人粪尿等混合底肥，翻泥时又上了三十担青草肥，插秧后又分期上了三次追肥，共用骨粉、豆饼、茶饼、石灰二百八十斤和草木灰九担。此外，他又选种优良品种胜利籼，做了合式的秧田，及时除灭了害虫。刘锡初的经验证明，只要注意改良土壤和提高技术，坏地也可以得到丰收。现在，当地的农民正在学习他的丰产经验。
