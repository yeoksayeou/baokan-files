    To the Esteemed Chairman Mao:
    As we welcome the third National Day, we look back at the glorious path our country has traversed in the past three years. Under your leadership and that of the Central People's Government, the people of our motherland have achieved great successes in all aspects of construction; and large-scale economic and cultural construction is about to unfold throughout the country. A truly unified, independent, and unprecedentedly powerful New China stands tall on the plains of Asia, and our country's international status has been elevated to an unprecedented level. The Peace Conference of the Asian and Pacific Regions is being held in our capital, which is an honor for the people of our country, and we feel extremely excited and proud.
    Our Volunteer Army has been entrusted by the people of our motherland with the mission of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and has been fighting abroad for nearly two years. In the past two years, we and the Korean People's Army have defeated the frantic attacks of the U.S. aggressor troops. From October of the year before last to the end of August this year alone, we have annihilated more than 600,000 enemy troops, of which more than 270,000 were U.S. aggressor troops; we shattered the barbarous germ warfare and chemical warfare carried out by the U.S. aggressor troops; drove them back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, stabilized the Korean war situation, defended North Korea, safeguarded the security of our northeastern border, and defended peace in Asia and the world. The victories we have achieved on the Korean battlefield are inseparable from the great achievements of our motherland over the past three years and the active support of the people of our motherland. On this National Day, we extend our highest respects to you. We once again assure you and the people of our motherland: We will definitely carry the great cause of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country through to the end! We will strive to achieve a ceasefire in Korea and to defend peace in Asia and the world!
    Respectfully, the Entire Command, Combatants, and Staff of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    September 27, 1952

    中国人民志愿军致毛泽东主席的贺电
    敬爱的毛主席：
    在迎接第三届国庆节的时候，我们回顾了我们的国家在三年来所走过的光荣的道路。祖国人民在您和中央人民政府的领导下，各方面的建设工作都得到了伟大的成就；并且就要在全国范围内展开大规模的经济建设和文化建设。一个真正统一、独立、空前强大的新中国屹立于亚洲平原之上，我国的国际地位是空前的提高了。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在我国首都召开，这是我国人民的光荣，我们感到无比的兴奋和骄傲。
    我们志愿军接受了祖国人民抗美援朝、保家卫国的付托出国作战将近两周年了。两年来，我们和朝鲜人民军一道打败了美国侵略军的疯狂进攻，仅从前年十月到今年八月底止，我们已歼灭敌军六十万人以上，其中美国侵略军占二十七万人以上；粉碎了美国侵略军野蛮地进行的细菌战、化学战；把它们赶回到三八线附近，稳定了朝鲜战局，保卫了北朝鲜，保卫了我国东北国境的安全，保卫了亚洲和世界的和平。我们在朝鲜战场上取得的胜利是和祖国三年来的伟大成就与祖国人民的积极支援分不开的。在这个国庆节，特向您致崇高的敬礼。我们并再一次向您和祖国人民保证：一定把抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大事业进行到底！为着实现朝鲜的停战，为了保卫亚洲和世界的和平而努力奋斗！
    中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员、工作人员敬上
    一九五二年九月二十七日
