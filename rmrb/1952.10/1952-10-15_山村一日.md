    A Day in a Mountain Village
    By Our Correspondent Tian Liu
    On the very last morning of August, 1952, with stars still in the sky, Old Wang woke up. While dressing, he muttered to himself, "It's Sunday again, time flies..."
    Old Cai, who was sleeping next to him, retorted, "What does Sunday have to do with us?"
    "It has a lot to do with us." Old Wang was already dressed and getting out of bed:
    "The co-op members all rest, so you can't work either."
    Previously, only government offices and schools had a weekly holiday system. Farmers always worked from morning till night, year in and year out, and didn't know what "Sunday" meant. The two Xinhua News Agency photojournalists and I had arrived in this village the previous evening after dark, and we encountered this novel thing as soon as we arrived—Sundays in the countryside. How do the farmers spend their day off? What do they do on this day? Old Wang, seeing us asking this and that, said, "I won't rest today, I'll accompany you to spend this Sunday together. See for yourselves, and you'll know everything."
    Old Wang is the Party Branch Secretary and the chairman of the agricultural production cooperative in this village. His name is Wang Jinyun. The village is called Yaoshanggou, a mountain village in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province. Its history and current situation can very well represent the general situation of the old revolutionary base areas of the Taihang Mountains. Yaoshanggou has more than 220 households, and more than 170 households have joined the agricultural production cooperative.
    Yaoshanggou Village is located on a very high loess ridge. Standing at the door, you can see very, very far. The village is surrounded by winding and deep gullies. We couldn't remember at all which gully we had come from last night. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, people used these ever-changing "maze gullies" to fight the enemy, and the enemy always suffered great losses and left. In March 1943, the Japanese invaders occupied Panlong Town and installed a blockhouse on the ridge east of Yaoshanggou Village, specifically to deal with the unyielding people in this area. The Yaoshanggou militia killed 80 Japanese soldiers and captured more than 10 alive in eight months, finally cooperating with the Eighth Route Army and the nearby people to force the enemy to retreat. However, the good terrain for fighting the enemy in the past has now become a major difficulty for production and construction: from this piece of farmland to that piece of farmland, it looks like it's right in front of you, but to get there, you always have to go down a gully and climb a cliff, at least two or three *li*. Plus, they're all steep sheep trails, unsuitable for livestock or vehicles, so whether it's delivering manure, transporting soil, or moving crops, it all depends on people's shoulders. What's even more difficult is the lack of water; digging ten or eight *zhang* deep is still a "bone-dry" loess layer. The water people drink is all rainwater collected from the summer and autumn in dry cellars. Therefore, the crops in Yaoshanggou are often threatened by drought. "It would be great if we never lacked water," Old Wang said when introducing the village's situation to us. "Then our crops would grow even better."
    After breakfast, we went to play by the village. It was a clear day, the sky was azure, the sunshine was bright, and the shadows of the trees were imprinted on the earth like woodcut prints. The gentle autumn breeze carried the fragrance of the ripening crops, and the harmonious sounds of insects and birds floated in the clear sky. Most of the land around the village is used as vegetable gardens by the co-op members - potatoes, beans, and pumpkins. The pumpkins were already ripe, rolling in the fields like big balls, shining with orange-red light in the early autumn sun. On Sunday, although we couldn't see the moving scenes of collective labor, we saw the co-op members working in their private plots—the vegetable gardens. Farmers in twos and threes were working freely in their vegetable gardens. A middle-aged woman wearing a sky-blue new cloth shirt was picking handfuls of plump beans into a bamboo basket, followed by a seven- or eight-year-old girl. Whether it was the mother coaxing the child, or the child's own creation, the little girl was wearing a large pumpkin leaf as a hat, and colorful flowers were tied to her two shiny braids, swaying on her pretty shoulders, looking like butterflies flying around her.
    "Now that we're outside the village, let's go see our crops."
    Old Wang led us down a gully and up a slope, and fields of crops, like forests and walls, appeared before our eyes. The crops were growing unexpectedly well: sorghum stood tall in the fields like small trees, and the corn grew two people high, with large ears growing on thick stalks, like outstretched arms. This is high-yielding corn, totaling ten *mu*. Old Wang said that each *mu* could yield at least 1,500 *jin*.
    "Such an ear of grain can yield more than two *liang*." We stopped in front of a lush valley, and Old Wang lovingly held the ear of grain flat in his palm. The top of the ear of grain was level with his fingertips, and the end had already reached his elbow. "Each *mu* is planted with 9,000 to 12,000 plants, and it can yield more than 1,000 *jin*, exceeding the plan."
    "What was the plan?"
    "850 *jin* per *mu*."
    Yaoshanggou Agricultural Production Cooperative has more than 1,700 *mu* of autumn fields and more than 700 *mu* of wheat fields. The average yield of all the land this year will reach 2 *shi* and 4 *dou* per *mu*. It was surprising to us to get such a harvest on this barren ridge with poor soil. Old Wang told us that before the war, the land here could only yield 1 *shi*, 1 *dou*, and 8 *sheng*. After the long period of war devastation, it further dropped to 9 *dou* and 5.9 *he* in 1948. This year's yield is more than double that before the war, equivalent to 250 percent of 1948. That is to say, in the three years since the founding of our great motherland, the farmers of Yaoshanggou have increased the yield of their land by more than one and a half times.
    "We organized agricultural production cooperatives in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions," Old Wang said when answering our questions about the reasons for the rapid increase in production. "The cooperative's land is managed uniformly, and we plant whatever is suitable, which can give full play to the advantages of the land; with more people and greater strength, we can expand investment in the land, we can cultivate deeply and meticulously, we can turn sloping land into flat land by cutting and filling, we can bring sand into sticky soil to improve the soil..."
    Old Wang's words were interrupted by a burst of noisy voices approaching from afar. A group of young people walked out of the village, laughing and joking. One said, "Ha! The chairman is still here to inspect our work on Sunday?" Another said, "Chairman, are you buying anything? I'll bring it back for you."
    After this group of happy young people left, Old Wang said enviously, "Today's young people are so happy! When I was their age, I was working as a long-term laborer for the landlord. Not to mention Sunday rest and watching operas, I had to work even on the first day of the Lunar New Year."
    This group of young people was going to Panlong Town, which is eight *li* away from the village, to watch an opera. There, a material exchange conference—Old Wang called it the "Mule and Horse Conference"—was being held. It was very lively. In addition to the trading of cattle, mules, horses, industrial products, and local products, there were also two good operas.
    After visiting the agricultural production cooperative's "small farm," we more specifically understood the reasons for the rapid development of agricultural production in Yaoshanggou Village. They have two small farms, namely agricultural experiment zones, one for testing varieties and one for testing cultivation methods. The former provides information on which varieties are most suitable for local cultivation; the latter provides the basis for reforming cultivation methods. This year, the Yaoshanggou Agricultural Production Cooperative selected all the excellent varieties that had been tested and carried out agricultural innovation work in many aspects: all the land was cultivated more than three times, of which high-yield land and "intermediate land" were cultivated four times; the cultivation depth reached six to seven inches; attention was paid to fertilization and weeding techniques, with an average of 90 loads of fertilizer applied per *mu*, and 120 to 150 loads on intermediate and high-yield land... These measures enabled the crops of the agricultural production cooperative to grow luxuriantly, resulting in higher yields year after year. But the real understanding of the superiority of the cooperative over the individual peasant economy came after visiting the newly completed reservoir project. This is a large reservoir that can exempt 300 *mu* of land from drought. Fighting drought and reducing the threat of drought have been the wishes and hopes of the farmers of Yaoshanggou for many years, and today it is beginning to be realized.
    At noon, I went to Han Jinmu's house for dinner. Han Jinmu insisted on letting me sit on the *kang* covered with new felt. While handing me noodles covered with cabbage, he said to me, "I went to see the opera. I didn't know your meal would be sent to my house, so I didn't prepare anything. Have a simple meal!"—I wanted to ask him what he meant by a good meal, but I changed my mind:
    "Did you buy anything at the conference?"
    "No," Jinmu said. He raised his head towards his young wife and explained, "I wanted to buy her a floral cloth shirt. But the patterns weren't good, so I didn't buy one."
    When I learned that he was a refugee who had moved here from another place in 1947, I was simply amazed at his current prosperous life.
    "Everyone is like this," Jinmu said. "Everyone's life is getting better day by day."
    Jinmu told me about the changes in the lives of many people in the village. Among them was a farmer named Li Shuizhong, with a family of five. In 1950, when the village had not yet organized an agricultural production cooperative, his family only had an income of 20 *shi* of grain. Last year, he joined the agricultural production cooperative led by Wang Jinyun, and after the autumn harvest, he received 37 *shi* and 1 *dou* of grain. This year, his sixteen-year-old younger brother is no longer herding sheep for others, but is attending elementary school. Although the family's income from the younger brother herding sheep has decreased, Li Shuizhong's family's income has still increased from 37 *shi* last year to 42 *shi* this year due to the continued increase in land yields in the cooperative. The degree of change in life can be imagined.
    The abundant harvest is not only changing the economic face of the countryside, but also the cultural face. Yaoshanggou now has three libraries, located in three natural villages, with more than 700 books, and subscribes to 57 newspapers and magazines. Closely coordinating with the library work are 27 newspaper readers and three civil schools. The 24 blackboard newspapers run by the Party's propagandists regularly carry out patriotic and collectivist education for the farmers. In the afternoon, I visited the library in the Gedao natural village. It is located in a large house, which is decorated very beautifully. Mao Zedong's portrait and many award banners are hung on the walls. Many books are neatly arranged on the T-shaped long tables. A dozen young people are reading inside. The librarian told me: "Forty to fifty people come to borrow books from the three libraries every day."
    "Let's go to Nangou," Old Wang suggested as we came out of the library. "That's the liveliest place on Sunday!"
    Old Wang led us all the way to Nangou. Soon, we heard bursts of voices and laughter coming from the bottom of the gully. After turning two bays and going down a slope, a happy scene immediately appeared before our eyes: originally, a clear spring gushed out from the crevices of the rocks at the foot of the mountain, forming a small stream. Many men and women were washing clothes and feet by the river, carrying out a sanitation campaign. Colorful clothes were drying on the grass and rocks on both sides of the riverbank, looking like blooming petals of flowers from a distance. Several children were chasing and playing back and forth. Several other children were throwing small stones at the frogs in the river. Closest to us, a young farmer in his twenties was vigorously rubbing a beautiful floral cloth shirt on a smooth stone. As soon as Old Wang saw it, he asked with a smile:
    "Is that a shirt you're washing for your wife? Very exemplary."
    "Can't I wash it!" The young man asked back with composure, but his face turned red, and he murmured defensively: "Men and women are equal. If she has time, she washes for me. If I have time, why can't I wash for her?"
    Everyone laughed heartily. The young couple washing clothes opposite him laughed the loudest. Xinhua News Agency reporter Old Cai captured this happy scene with his camera. The young man, whose face was flushed with laughter, then found an object to counterattack and said to the young couple opposite him: "If you two are photographed together, the people who see the picture will definitely say that you two are dating."
    People laughed again, laughing more happily and louder. The entire valley echoed with happy echoes. (Attached picture)
    The corn grows two people high, and the large ears are like outstretched arms.

    山村一日
    本报记者　田流
    一九五二年八月最末一天的清早，天上还有星星，老王就醒来了。他一面穿衣服一面自语：“又星期啦，真快呀……”
    睡在他旁边的老蔡反问道：“星期对咱有甚关系呢？”
    “关系大啦。”老王已经穿好衣服，走下床来：
    “社员们都休息，你们也不能工作啊。”
    早先，只有机关、学校才有星期休假制度，农民们总是一年到头、从早到晚地劳动，哪里知道什么叫“星期”呢？我同新华社两位摄影记者是前一天天黑后才赶到这村的，一到就碰见这么件新鲜事——农村里竟也有星期日了。农民们怎样过他们的休息日呢？他们在这天作些什么呢？老王见我们问这问那，就说：“我今天不休息，陪你们一起过这个星期日吧。亲自看看，就什么都知道了。”
    老王是这个村的党支部书记，又是农业生产合作社的主席，名叫王锦云。这个村庄叫窑上沟，是山西省武乡县的一个山村。它的经历和现在的情况，很可以代表太行山老根据地的一般的村庄。窑上沟共有二百二十多户人家，有一百七十多户参加了农业生产合作社。
    窑上沟村座落在一架很高的黄土圪梁上。站在房门口，就可以望出老远老远去。村的四周，到处是曲曲弯弯的深沟。我们昨夜从哪条沟来的，一点也记不清楚了。抗日战争期间，人们就利用这千变万化的“迷沟”同敌人斗争，每次敌人都吃了大亏而去。一九四三年三月，日寇侵占蟠龙镇，又在窑上沟村东的圪梁上安上炮楼，专门对付这一带坚贞不屈的人民。窑上沟的民兵八个月击毙日寇八十名，活捉十多名，终于配合八路军和附近人民把敌人逼退了。但是，往日对敌斗争的好地形，今天却成了生产建设的大困难：从这块耕地到那块耕地，看起来好像就在眼前，但要走去啊，总得下一条沟爬一个崖，少说也有三、二里，加上都是陡峭的羊肠道，走不得牲口驶不得车，无论送粪运土，搬运庄稼，都是凭人双肩担。更困难的是没有水，挖上十丈八丈还是“干格拉拉”的黄土层。人吃的水，都是挖旱窖积存下的夏秋的雨水。因此，窑上沟的庄稼常常受旱灾的威胁。“甚时不缺水了就好啦，”老王向我们介绍村里的情况时说：“那时，我们的庄稼会长得更好。”
    早饭后我们到村边去玩。这是个晴朗的日子，天空碧蓝，阳光灿烂，树影子就像木刻画似的印在大地上。轻柔的秋风送来正在成熟的庄稼的芳香，虫声鸟语和谐地在晴空里飘荡。村边大部是社员们的菜地——马铃薯、豆角和南瓜。南瓜已经熟了，像大皮球一样一个个滚在田里，在初秋的阳光下闪着橘红色的光。在星期天，虽然不能看到集体劳动的动人场面，却看到了合作社社员们在自留地——菜园上的劳动情形。三三两两的农民，自由自在地在他们的菜地里劳动。一个身穿天安蓝新布衫的中年妇女正在把肥嫩的豆角满把满把地摘进竹篮里，身旁跟着一个七八岁的小姑娘。不知是妈妈哄孩子呢，还是孩子自己的创造，小姑娘头上戴着一片很大的南瓜叶当草帽，两条光亮的发辫上系着各色的鲜花，
    一走三摆地在她那俊俏的双肩上摇动，很像好些蝴蝶在她的周围飞舞。
    “既到村外来了，去看看我们的庄稼吧。”
    老王领我们走下一条沟，爬上一道坡，如林似墙的庄稼就出现在我们眼前了。庄稼长得出人意外的好：高粱像一棵棵小树挺立在田野，玉茭长得有两人高，肥大的穗子长在粗壮的茎秆上，像伸出来一条条臂膀。这是丰产玉茭，共有十亩。老王说每亩至少能收一千五百斤。
    “这样的谷穗，一个能收二两多。”我们走到一块繁茂的谷地前停下来，老王爱抚地把谷穗平托在手掌上。谷穗的顶端和他的指尖放齐，末端已经达到他的肘间了。“一亩地共植九千棵到一万二千棵，可以收千斤以上，超过计划了。”
    “计划是多少呢？”
    “一亩八百五十斤。”
    窑上沟农业生产合作社共有一千七百多亩秋田，七百多亩麦田。全部土地的平均产量，今年将达到每亩产二石四斗，在这童山土岭、土质瘠薄的圪梁上，竟能得到这样的收获，不禁使我们感到惊奇。老王告诉我们：战前，这里的土地一亩只能收一石一斗八升。经过长期的战争摧残，一九四八年更降到九斗五升九合。今年的产量则比战前提高了一倍多；相当于一九四八年的百分之二百五十。就是说，在我们伟大祖国建国的三年间，窑上沟的农民把他们的土地产量提高了一倍半。
    “我们按照毛主席的指示，组织起农业生产合作社。”老王回答我们产量迅速提高的原因时这样说，“合作社的土地统一经营，宜种什么就种什么，能发挥地利；人多力量大，可以扩大对土地的投资，可以深耕细作，能把坡地里切外垫变成平地，黏土地里担进砂土，改良土壤……”
    老王的话还没说完，就被一阵由远而近的喧嚷声打断了。一群青年人嘻嘻哈哈地从村里走出来，一见我们就嚷开了。这个说：“哈！星期天社长还来检查我们的工作？”那个说：“社长，买什么吗？我给你捎来。”
    这群快乐的青年人走后，老王羡慕地说：“如今的青年多幸福！我像他们这年纪时，正给地主扛长工哩。别说星期休息、看戏，大年初一也得动弹啊。”
    这群青年人是到离村八里路的蟠龙镇去看戏的。那里正举行物资交流大会——老王叫它“骡马大会”。很热闹，除了有耕牛、骡马、工业品和土产的交易外，还有两台好戏。
    参观了农业生产合作社的“小农场”，我们才更具体地弄清了窑上沟村农业生产迅速发展的原因。他们有两个小农场，即农事试验区，一个试验品种，一个试验耕作方法。前者提供什么品种最适宜本地栽培；后者提供改革耕作方法的依据。今年，窑上沟农业生产合作社就是全部选用了经过试验的优良品种，并进行了多方面的农业革新工作：全部土地都耕过三遍以上，其中丰产地和“中级地”耕过四次；耕深达六寸至七寸；注意到施肥和锄草的技术，每亩地平均施肥九十担，中级地和丰产地达一百二十担到一百五十担……这些措施，使农业生产合作社的庄稼繁茂地生长起来，得到一年比一年高的产量。但真正体会到合作社优于个体的农民经济，还是在参观了新近完工的蓄水池工程之后。这是个很大的蓄水池，可以使三百亩土地免除旱灾。向旱灾斗争；减轻旱灾的威胁，这是窑上沟农民多年来的志愿和希望，今天开始实现了。
    午间我到韩金木家吃饭。韩金木硬让我坐在铺着新毡的炕上，一面把覆着卷心菜的面条递给我，一面向我说：“我去看戏了，不知道把你的饭派到我家里，没预备什么，吃点便饭吧！”——我想问问他所说的好饭是什么，可又改了口：
    “到会上买什么东西来？”
    “没有”。金木说。他把头向他年轻的妻子扬一扬，解释道：“想给她买件花布衫。可是花样都不好，没买成。”
    当我知道他是一九四七年从外地搬来的难民时，我对他现今的丰裕生活简直有些惊奇了。
    “大家都是这样，”金木说，“谁的生活也是一天更比一天好。”
    金木告诉我村里许多人家生活变化的情形。其中有个叫李水忠的农民，一家五口人。一九五零年村里还没有组织农业生产合作社的时候，他家只有二十石粮食的收入。去年他参加了王锦云领导的农业生产合作社，秋后分了三十七石一斗粮食。今年，他的十六岁的弟弟已经不再给人放羊，而入小学读书了。虽然家庭中少了弟弟放羊的收入，但因合作社里土地产量继续提高，李水忠家的收入还是由去年的三十七石增加到今年的四十二石。两年之间，收入增加一倍多。生活变化的程度，也就可以想像得到了。
    丰富的收获，不仅改变着农村的经济面貌，也改变着农村的文化面貌。窑上沟现在有了三个图书室，分设在三个自然村上，共有七百多册图书，还订阅着五十七份报纸和杂志。同图书馆工作密切配合着的，还有二十七个读报员，三处民校。党的宣传员主办的二十四处黑板报，更经常向农民进行爱国主义与集体主义的教育。下午我参观了圪道自然村的图书室。它设在一栋很大的房子里，里面装饰得很漂亮。墙上挂着毛主席画像和许多奖旗，许多图书整齐地排放在丁字形的长几上，十几个青年正在里面看书。图书管理员告诉我：“三个图书室每天有四、五十个人来借阅图书。”
    “到南沟看看去吧，”我们从图书室出来时，老王提议：“那才是星期日最热闹的地方呢！”
    老王领着我们一直往南沟走去。不久便听到从沟底传来的一阵阵的人声笑语。转过两道湾又下一段坡，一种欢乐的场面立时出现在眼前：原来山脚下的石缝间涌出来一股清泉，汇成了一条小溪。许多男女正在河边洗衣服、洗脚，进行清洁卫生运动。五颜十色的衣衫，晒在河岸两旁的草地上、山石上，远远看去，就像盛开的片片花朵。几个孩子来回地追逐着玩耍。另外几个孩子用小石块投掷着河里的青蛙。靠我们最近的地方，一个二十多岁的青年农民正在一块光滑的石头上用力揉洗着一件漂亮的花布衫。老王一见，便笑着问道：
    “是给老婆洗的布衫吗？真模范。”
    “不能洗吗！”那个青年神态自若地反问，可是他的脸却红晕起来了，辩解地喃喃道：“男女平等嘛，她有工夫就给我洗，我有工夫为甚不能替她洗呢。”
    所有的人都哈哈大笑起来了。在他对面洗衣服的一对青年男女笑得最响。新华社记者老蔡把这种欢乐的情景摄入了镜头。这个被笑得脸红了的青年这时找到了反攻的对象，就向他对面那对青年人说道：“把你俩照在一起，看了像片的人准说你俩搞对象呢。”
    人们又大笑起来，笑得更欢乐更响。全山谷都荡漾着幸福的回响。（附图片）
