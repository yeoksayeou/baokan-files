The work of preventing and controlling crop diseases and insect pests in autumn and winter is one of the important measures to ensure increased crop yield per unit area in the coming year. After autumn, when the activity of diseases and insect pests decreases, it is a favorable period for prevention and control. To this end, agricultural departments at all levels must seize the opportunity, vigorously organize the masses of farmers, and conscientiously implement the following tasks:

	I. Monitor residual locusts and do a good job in egg survey: In areas with residual locusts, their activities must be monitored, and the locust egg-laying locations, area, and density must be checked. Mark them, draw charts, and prepare for locust control. For detailed methods, refer to the "Trial Method for Scouting Locusts" issued by our ministry.

	II. Universally promote thorough treatment of rice roots in rice areas to kill overwintering rice borers: In areas where rice stem borers occur, autumn plowing and winter plowing are required to be universally implemented, and the rice roots should be turned into the soil in combination with harrowing; all rice roots remaining on the soil surface and rice roots in clay fields and green manure fields must be dug up, picked up, and burned to kill overwintering rice borers; in low-lying fields with convenient water sources, long-term soaking after plowing can be used for a better insecticidal effect.

	III. Launch a weeding campaign: Experience has shown that clearing weeds in and around fields has a significant effect on the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. Therefore, a vigorous weeding campaign must be launched. Especially in Liaodong, Liaoxi, Hebei, the plains, Shanxi, Shandong, and the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi, and the Longhai Line area of Henan, attention should be paid to thoroughly digging up and burning weeds such as summer dry grass, bitter herbs, violet, and Pulsatilla chinensis. In areas with mulberry trees inside and outside cotton fields, farmers must be mobilized to dig and bury them.

	IV. In combination with autumn plowing and winter plowing, vigorously mobilize and organize the masses of farmers to pick up insects and pupae to eliminate underground pests, cotton bollworms, soybean worms, etc.

	V. Clean up the fields and handle straw to eliminate diseases and insects early: Thoroughly pick up and destroy grain stubble, fallen branches, fallen leaves, fallen fruits, and prune insect branches to prevent and control cotton anthracnose, potato late blight, codling moths, red spiders, etc. Use stone rollers, mud sealing, chopping, or early burning to treat sorghum, corn, millet, rice, and cotton straw to kill overwintering borers.

	VI. Fully prepare insecticides and machinery: All localities must do a good job in repairing and stocking sprayers and dusters, improve the safety equipment of pharmaceutical machinery factories, strengthen the storage of agents, and submit the needs and allocation plans for next year's machinery and agents to cooperative departments at all levels for unified supply. In terms of pharmaceutical machinery manufacturing, a strict identification system should be established to ensure the specifications and quality of pharmaceutical machinery.

	VII. Carry out technical training movement level by level: All localities should conscientiously summarize the experience of this year's disease and pest control work, and hold training courses for professional disease and pest control cadres (funded by local sources). In addition to agricultural cadres, efforts should be made to attract some local agricultural labor models, cooperative cadres, youth and women cadres, etc. to participate in the study; through labor model meetings, technical seminars, roving exhibitions, winter schools, etc., widely publicize the technology of disease and pest control. Each disease and pest control station should train at least two hundred grassroots cooperative cadres and rural production activists on a rotating basis.

    关于开展秋冬两季防治农作物病虫害工作的指示
    做好秋冬两季防治病虫害工作，是保证来年农作物单位面积增产的重要措施之一。在秋后病虫活动减少，更是防治病虫害的有利时期。为此，各级农业部门必须抓紧时机，大力组织农民群众，认真执行下列工作：
    一、监视残蝗和做好查卵工作：凡有残蝗地区必须监视其活动，检查蝗虫产卵地点、面积及密度。作出标志，绘制图表，做好治蝗准备工作。详细办法，参考我部印发的“侦察蝗虫试用办法”。
    二、水稻区普遍推行彻底处理稻根，杀死过冬螟虫：三化螟发生地区要求普遍实行秋耕、冬耕，结合耙土将稻根翻入土中；凡留在土面的稻根以及黏土田、绿肥田中的稻根，必须掘光、拣光、烧光，以杀死过冬螟虫；水源方便的低田，可于耕后长期浸水，杀虫效果更大。
    三、开展除草运动：经验证明，清除田间田边杂草，对防治病虫害有显著效果。为此，必须大力开展除草运动。特别在辽东、辽西、河北、平原、山西、山东及陕西的关中、河南的陇海线地区，应注意彻底挖除与烧毁夏枯草、苦荬菜、紫花地丁、白头翁等杂草。凡棉田内外有桑棵的地区，须动员农民群众挖埋。
    四、结合秋耕、冬耕，大力发动和组织农民群众拾虫拾蛹，以消灭地下害虫、棉铃虫、豆虫等。
    五、清洁田园和处理藁秆，早期消灭病虫：彻底拾毁谷茬、落枝、落叶、落果、剪除虫枝，以防除棉花炭疽病、马铃薯疫病、食心虫、红蜘蛛等。用石滚、泥封、切碎或早期烧毁等办法处理高粱、玉米、谷子及水稻、棉花的藁秆，以杀死过冬钻心虫。
    六、充分准备杀虫药械：各地须做好喷雾器、喷粉器的修理和储备工作，改善药械工厂的安全设备，加强药剂的保管，并将明年药械的需要及调配计划提交各级合作社部门统筹供应。在药械制造方面，应建立严格的鉴定制度，保证药械的规格质量。
    七、逐级开展技术传授运动：各地应认真总结今年防治病虫害工作的经验，并举办病虫害专业干部训练班（经费由地方自筹），除农业干部参加外，应争取一部分地方农业劳动模范、合作社干部、青年和妇女干部等参加学习；通过劳动模范会、技术座谈会、巡回展览、冬学等，广泛宣传防治病虫害的技术。每个病虫防治站应巡回训练基层合作社干部和农村生产积极分子至少二百人。
