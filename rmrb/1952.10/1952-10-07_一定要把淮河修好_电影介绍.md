    “We Must Harness the Huai River Well” Movie Introduction
    Bai Yuan
    “We Must Harness the Huai River Well” is an excellent documentary film. It reflects a great construction that is currently underway in our country on the screen, allowing everyone to see and feel the infinite magnificence of this great event.
    The Huai River was originally an extremely beautiful river. In ordinary times, the water of the Huai River flows quietly. Along the cities and villages on both sides of the Huai River, countless sailboats and small steamships navigate day and night. The boundless fertile land on both sides of the Huai River produces abundant grains and various famous specialties. If you take a two-hour small steamship from Bengbu on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to Huaiyuan City on the bank of the Huai River when the pomegranate flowers are in bloom, and look at the beautiful Huai River through the bright red flowers, no one would think that so many disasters had occurred on this river. In the past, the reactionary rulers not only did not carry out good governance of this river, but also personally created disasters. Since Chiang Kai-shek dug open the Huayuankou of the Yellow River in 1938, causing the floods of the Yellow River to flow into the Huai River, floods have ravaged the entire Huai River basin every year. The people on both sides of the Huai River abandoned their homeland and were forced to flee everywhere. Those tragic scenes, just like what we see on the screen, still bring tears to the eyes of the people on both sides of the Huai River when they recall them.
    After the last major flood in the Huai River in 1950, under the call of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people immediately started to harness this river. More than two million workers, peasants, People's Liberation Army soldiers participating in national construction, and various technical personnel, under the organization and leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, exerted endless power. For the first time in Chinese history, a great project to create happiness for the people and conquer nature appeared. In the movie, just like standing on the construction site of this great project in person, watching the surging crowds covering the vast land, no one can help but marvel at the infinite power of human labor and wisdom. Here, countless touching stories and heroic deeds that cannot be fully praised have emerged. The movie currently being screened especially introduces us to several major projects such as the construction of the Runheji Diversion Sluice, the mountain valley reservoir, and the Huai River levee. Through these major projects, people can already understand the magnificent scope of the Huai River harnessing project. The project is extremely arduous. In the construction of each project, many major difficulties were encountered. Under the leadership and encouragement of the Communist Party, countless Communist Party members and activists among the masses fought selflessly against various difficult natural conditions at those critical junctures. Many heroes and models emerged in this process. In the movie, there is a particularly moving scene: when building the Runheji Diversion Sluice, in order to control the floods of the Huai River, it was necessary to build a dam there to block a section of the old river channel of the Huai River and build a new river channel. If this dam could not be completed before the flood season, the floods of the Huai River could not be controlled, and the diversion sluice could not play its role. When the final blocking project of this dam was underway, the flood season was approaching. The water of the Huai River was rushing down from the upper reaches more and more rapidly. Through the mobilization work on the construction site, we can see how the strength of the Chinese Communist Party encouraged thousands upon thousands of people to overcome the floods and complete the arduous task of building the motherland in a difficult and critical moment.
    The Huai River after the harnessing has brought us a scene of joyful life. The flowers on the pomegranate trees have bloomed and borne fruit. The seeds sown on the land are harvested. The people on both sides of the Huai River have since been freed from disaster. Now, the entire Huai River construction project is still continuing. It is not only for the people on both sides of the Huai River, but also for the happy life of the entire Chinese people.

    “一定要把淮河修好”电影介绍
    白原
    “一定要把淮河修好”是一部优秀的文献纪录影片。它把正在我国进行着的一个伟大建设反映在银幕上，使每一个人都能够看到，而且感受到这个伟大事件的无限壮丽的景象。
    淮河原是一条极其美丽的河流。在平常的时候，淮河的流水静静地流着。沿着淮河两岸的城市和乡村，无数帆船和小汽船终日不断地在航行。淮河两岸一望无际的肥沃的土地，出产丰富的粮食以及各种著名的特产。如果在石榴花开的时候，从京沪路上的蚌埠坐两个钟头的小汽船到淮河岸边的怀远城去，透过那一片鲜红的花朵看着那美丽的淮河，谁也不会想到在这一条河流上，曾经发生过那么多的灾难。在过去，反动统治者对这一条河流不仅没有进行过很好的治理，而且还亲手来制造灾难。自从一九三八年蒋介石挖开黄河花园口，使黄河的洪水流到淮河以后，从此每年洪水一到，即在整个淮河流域泛滥。淮河两岸的人民抛弃了自己的乡土，被驱迫着四处逃亡。那些悲惨的情景，就如同我们在银幕上所看见的一样，现在淮河两岸的人民回忆起来还止不住流泪。
    在一九五○年淮河所发生的最后一次大水以后，在毛主席的号召下，中国人民立即动手来治理这条河流。二百多万工人、农民，参加祖国建设的人民解放军，以及各种技术人员，在共产党及人民政府的组织和领导下，发挥了无尽的力量。在中国的历史上，第一次出现了为人民创造幸福的、征服自然的伟大工程。在电影里，也和亲身站在这个伟大工程的工地上一样，看着那盖满了一片一片辽阔的土地的汹涌的人群，任何人也不能不惊叹人的劳动和智慧的无穷无尽的力量。在这里边，产生了无数写不尽的动人的故事，歌颂不完的英雄的事迹。现在放映的这一部电影，特别向我们介绍了建筑润河集分水闸、山谷水库、淮河大堤等几个主要工程。通过这些主要的工程，已经可以使人们了解治淮工程的雄伟的面貌。工程是极其艰巨的。在建筑每一个工程的时候，差不多都碰到许多重大的困难。在共产党的领导和鼓舞下，无数共产党员及群众中的积极分子在那些紧急关头奋不顾身地和各种困难的自然条件进行斗争。在这当中出现了许多英雄和模范。在电影里面，有一个特别动人的场面：在建筑润河集分水闸的时候，为了控制淮河的洪水，需要在那里筑一道拦河坝将淮河的一段旧河道堵住，另筑一段新的河道。这一道拦河坝如果不在汛期以前完成，淮河的洪水就无法控制，分水闸也不能发挥它的作用。在这一道拦河坝正在进行最后的堵口工程的时候，眼看着汛期就要来了。淮河的流水愈来愈急地从上游奔涌下来。通过工地上的鼓动工作，我们可以看见中国共产党的力量怎样鼓舞着千千万万的人群，在困难的紧急关头战胜了洪水，完成建设祖国的艰巨的任务。
    经过治理以后的淮河，给我带来了一片欢乐的生活的景象。石榴树上的花开了，结果了。土地播下了种籽就收获。淮河两岸的人民，从此脱离了灾难。现在，整个淮河的建设工程还在继续进行着。它不仅仅是为了淮河两岸的人民，也为了整个中国人民的幸福的生活。
