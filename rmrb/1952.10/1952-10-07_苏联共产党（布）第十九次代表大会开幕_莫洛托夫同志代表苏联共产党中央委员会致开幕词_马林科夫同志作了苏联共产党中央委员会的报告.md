Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: TASS Moscow, 6th: The 19th Congress of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union.

October 5, 1952, First Session.

The 19th Congress of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union opened on October 5 in the Grand Kremlin Palace. The hall was filled with delegates attending the Congress and many guests: representatives of the people of the Soviet capital, workers, government leaders and party leaders, representatives of science and art, and representatives of communist and workers' parties from other countries.

At 7 p.m., Comrade Stalin and his loyal comrades-in-arms Molotov, Malenkov, Voroshilov, Bulganin, Beria, Kaganovich, Khrushchev (formerly translated as Khrushchev), Andreyev, Mikoyan, and Kosygin appeared on the platform, and the delegates immediately responded with prolonged applause. Everyone stood up to salute, and cheers resounded throughout the hall: "Comrade Stalin, Hurrah!" "Great Stalin, Hurrah!" "Long Live Comrade Stalin!" "Our Own Beloved Stalin, Hurrah!" The cheers were expressed in the different languages of the people of the Soviet Union and the world. This warm cheer reflected the boundless love and loyalty of the people of the Soviet Union and the world for Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the genius leader of the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet people, and all progressive humanity, whom they deeply revered.

When the Congress opened, Comrade V.M. Molotov delivered the opening speech on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party.

The full text of the opening speech is as follows:

Comrades! On behalf of the Party Central Committee, I welcome the delegates to the 19th Party Congress, and also our dear guests who have come from the Communist Parties and other fraternal workers' class parties of various countries to attend our Congress. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

Today, we should first remember those who heroically defended our Soviet motherland in the war against the German aggressors and other aggressors and contributed their lives to our just cause. Let us all rise and observe a moment of silence for those who sacrificed in that war, for those who contributed their lives in the struggle against fascism and in the struggle for the freedom and independence of the Soviet Union. (All rise)

Some of the finest members of our party are no longer with us today. Alexander Sergeyevich Shcherbakov, who led the political work in the army during the difficult years of the war and was especially known within the party as an outstanding leader of the Moscow party organization, is no longer alive. Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin, a figure very familiar throughout the country and beloved by our party, is no longer with us. Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov, one of the talented representatives of Stalin's leadership core in the party, has also passed away. We also remember the names of other friends and comrades who were closely linked with the party throughout their lives and are no longer with us. To express our deep respect, let us observe a moment of silence for them. (All rise)

The last congress of our party was held in 1939. In the period since that congress, many events of great historical importance have occurred.

As everyone knows, the peaceful construction of our people was interrupted by the treacherous attack of German fascism on the Soviet Union. We were forced to temporarily stop the work of completing the tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan. We had to completely switch to a wartime footing and subordinate everything to the goal of defeating the enemy invading our territory.

The Second World War was the greatest test for the young multi-ethnic Soviet state. At the same time, it was also a comprehensive test of the correctness of our party's policies. During the war years, the Soviet people endured many difficult days and suffered significant sacrifices. However, in the severe test of these events, the Soviet Union did not weaken or waver. Under the leadership of our party, it became a socialist country that was more consolidated and stronger than ever before; its confidence in its own strength and the invincibility of its great cause was also stronger than ever before.

The Second World War ended with the defeat of the fascist aggressors, which in many ways liberated the forces of national liberation movements in Asia and Europe. Under the new conditions, especially due to the decisive role played by the Soviet Union in this war, a series of countries had the possibility, in the post-war period, to turn from the road of capitalist development to a new road, to the road of establishing and developing people's democratic countries. This marked the beginning of a new stage in the development of international socialism.

All of this explains why the ideologically guiding influence of our party on all aspects of national life has grown to such an extent today, and why our people so warmly love their party, the party of Lenin and Stalin. (Prolonged applause)

This also explains why our party now enjoys such high international prestige, and why the working people of other countries have such great trust and respect for our party and for Stalin's leadership. (Warm, prolonged applause)

In the post-war period, the Soviet Union concentrated its efforts on fulfilling the tasks of restoring and further developing the national economy and maintaining and consolidating international peace.

At this congress, we will discuss the directives on the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union (the Fifth Five-Year Plan). The achievements of last year and the economic achievements of this year prove that our people have already made great achievements in reaching the great goals of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. In order to move forward with confidence, we must wage a more resolute struggle against the shortcomings in our work; we must constantly and everywhere fight against conceit and bureaucratic complacency, always remember that criticism and self-criticism are indispensable fighting weapons for communists, and always remember that this is our way to improve the initiative of the masses - the Soviet way.

The resolutions of the Congress will inspire the party and the entire Soviet people not only to complete but also to overfulfill the new Five-Year Plan. This will mean a further and comprehensive strengthening of the power of the Soviet state and a great improvement in the material and cultural level of the people—the working class, the collective farmers, and the Soviet intellectuals. In implementing the Five-Year Plan, the Soviet people will also achieve major new achievements on the road from the gradual transition from socialism to communism. (Enthusiastic applause)

Of course, we have not forgotten that the Soviet Union is "among various countries," nor have we forgotten that there is still an imperialist camp pursuing adventurous and plundering plans, a camp that is arming itself, using all means to incite war hysteria, and preparing to launch another world war. This anti-democratic and aggressive camp is led by the reactionary ruling groups of the United States of America, who are carrying out the will of the monopoly capitalists. These insatiable monopoly capitalists are seeking to establish world hegemony by force in order to obtain greater profits. The American ruling groups bear the primary responsibility for the criminal war in Korea, for seizing China's Taiwan Island, for turning West Germany and Japan into vassal states, and for establishing aggressive military alliances (such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) in the West and the East to confront the peace-loving countries—the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries.

However, in recent years, especially in the post-war period, the significant weakening of the world capitalist system after a series of countries with a total population of 600 million broke away from the capitalist system cannot be concealed. The inability of capitalist countries to deal with the increasing new economic crises and the dangers of a large increase in unemployment cannot be concealed either. This danger also intensifies the opposition and friction between these countries and inevitably intensifies the class struggle within these countries. The warmongers and their journalistic lackeys are trying to deceive readers of the bourgeois press by pretending to be lovers of peace while spreading slanderous rumors that the Soviet Union has aggressive intentions. However, no matter how hard they try, they cannot conceal the fact that the constant threat to the freedom and national independence of the people of all countries, and the constant threat to peace and international security, comes precisely from the aggressive groups of the imperialist camp. Today, capitalism is in a stage of general crisis and is accelerating its path towards fascist rule. The more obvious the sinister and unreliable prospects and internal weaknesses, the more ferocious the major countries of the imperialist camp and their thuggish propaganda promoting another war become.

Opposing the camp of reaction and aggression is another camp—the international camp for defending peace and democracy. This peace-loving and democratic camp is deservedly led by the Soviet Union, which consistently pursues a policy of maintaining and consolidating international peace. (Prolonged applause)

Speaking of this, it must be pointed out that one of the most important results of the Second World War is the historical fact that the Soviet Union has completely freed itself from its internationally isolated position. Now, the people's democratic countries, the People's Republic of China, and the German Democratic Republic are working with the Soviet Union to safeguard the cause of peace and democracy. Moreover, today the cause of defending peace and democracy is also supported by the powerful international peace movement, which unites hundreds of millions of people, including millions of peace supporters in capitalist countries.

In the struggle to defend peace, we Soviet people have never forgotten for a moment that we must maintain due vigilance and be prepared at any time to give a powerful counterattack to any aggression by the belligerent camp of imperialism. Without this, the cause of maintaining and consolidating peace cannot be properly safeguarded. In this regard, we abide by Comrade Stalin's famous instructions, which have become the foundation for the struggle of the people of all countries to maintain the cause of peace:

"Peace can be maintained and consolidated if the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and persevere in this cause to the end."
(Prolonged, stormy applause) "War may become inevitable if the warmongers succeed in trapping the masses of the people with a web of lies, deceive the masses, and drag the masses into another world war."

This Party Congress will show how much the strength of the Soviet Union—the motherland of victorious socialism—has grown and strengthened. This Congress will also carry out its main task: to illuminate the path for continued progress with the light of Marxism-Leninism. We will advance along this path, achieve new and more brilliant victories of socialism in our country, and not only that, but also unite the international democratic forces more widely and powerfully to defend world peace. (Prolonged applause)

Our party is stronger and more united than ever before as we hold this 19th Congress. (Prolonged applause) The flag of our party, which has long been in glorious battles and has won many victories, is held high, calling our people to advance towards the victory of communism. (Prolonged applause) The name of the leader of our party, the name of Stalin, represents the best hopes and aspirations of all progressive mankind. (Prolonged and enthusiastic cheers. All rise)

Long live the Party of Lenin and Stalin! (Enthusiastic applause)

Long live the 19th Party Congress! (Enthusiastic applause)

May our beloved and great Stalin be forever healthy! (Prolonged and enthusiastic cheers. All rise. The whole hall cheers "Long live the great Stalin!" "Comrade Stalin, Hurrah!" "Glory to Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the Party and the people!" "Long live dear Stalin!")

Next, at Molotov's suggestion, the Congress began to elect the leading bodies of the Congress.

Comrade Mirnikov spoke on behalf of the representatives of the delegations of the states, border regions, and union republics and proposed the election of a 16-member Presidium of the Congress. The Congress approved the motion. The list of members of the Presidium of the Congress nominated by Comrade Mirnikov was as follows: Andrianov, Aristov, Bagirov, Beria, Bulganin, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Korotchenko, Kuusinen, Malenkov, Molotov, Niyazov, Patorichev, Stalin, Khrushchev, Shayakhmetov.

When Comrade Mirnikov mentioned the name of Comrade Stalin, stormy applause erupted in the hall, and everyone stood up.

The Congress unanimously elected this Presidium.

Comrade Molotov then gave the floor to Comrade Brezhnev, who, on behalf of the delegation representatives, proposed the election of the following persons to form the Secretariat of the Congress: Poskrebyshev, Ignatov, Gapitonov, Mgeladze, Mirnikov, Muratov, Pusanov, Sniečkus, Smirnov.

The Congress unanimously approved the Secretariat personnel nominated by Comrade Brezhnev.

Mgeladze, on behalf of the delegation representatives, proposed the election of the Drafting Committee of the Congress, consisting of the following personnel: Pospelov, Gavrov, Ilyichev, Mikhailov, Suslov, Tretyakova.

Comrade Molotov put Comrade Mgeladze's proposal to a vote, and the Congress unanimously elected the Drafting Committee suggested by Comrade Mgeladze.

Based on Comrade Patorichev's proposal, the Congress unanimously elected the Credentials Committee of the Congress, with the following members: Begov, Arutyunov, Babayev, Belyaev, Brezhnev, Vagapov, Grishin, Yefremov, Kahnbersin, Gilichenko, Kiselev, Kebin, Lachaikov, Shkiryatov, Yakovlev, etc.

After the election of the leading bodies, the Congress adopted the following agenda of the Congress:

4.  Amendments to the Statute of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union—Reporter is Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, Secretary of the Central Committee.
5.  Election of the central organs of the Party.

The Congress then adopted the working procedures of the Congress.

Then Comrade G.M. Malenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee, made a report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union.

The delegates attending the Congress and the guests were all intently listening to the report. The report was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the audience.

The Congress is scheduled to hold its next meeting on October 6.

    苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会开幕
    莫洛托夫同志代表苏联共产党中央委员会致开幕词
    马林科夫同志作了苏联共产党中央委员会的报告
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会。
    一九五二年十月五日第一次会议。
    苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会于十月五日在克里姆林宫大厅开幕。大厅中坐满了出席代表大会的代表以及许多来宾：苏联首都人民的代表、工人、政府领袖和党的领袖、科学和艺术界的代表及其他国家的共产党和工人党的代表。
    晚间七时，斯大林同志及其忠实战友莫洛托夫、马林科夫、伏罗希洛夫、布尔加宁、贝利亚、卡冈诺维奇、赫鲁晓夫（前译赫鲁舍切夫）、安德列耶夫、米高扬与柯西金在主席台上出现，代表们立即报以经久不息的掌声。每一个人都起立致敬，欢呼声响彻大厅：“斯大林同志，乌拉！”“伟大的斯大林，乌拉！”“斯大林同志万岁！”“我们自己的敬爱的斯大林，乌拉！”欢呼声以苏联和世界的人民的不同的语言发出。这种热烈的欢呼反映了苏联和世界的人民对苏联共产党、苏联人民和全体进步人类非常敬爱的天才领袖约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林的无限热爱和忠诚。
    代表大会开幕时，由维·米·莫洛托夫同志代表共产党中央委员会致开幕词。
    开幕词全文如下：
    同志们！我代表党中央委员会，欢迎第十九次党代表大会的代表们，同时并欢迎代表各国共产党和其他兄弟的工人阶级党前来列席我们大会的亲爱的来宾们。（暴风雨般的长时间的鼓掌）
    今天，我们首先应该记起那些曾在对德国侵略者及其他侵略者的战争中英勇地保卫我们的苏维埃祖国、为我们的正义的事业而贡献出自己的生命的人们。让我们大家起立，为那些在那次战争中牺牲的人们默哀，为那些在反对法西斯主义的斗争中、在争取苏联的自由和独立的斗争中贡献出自己的生命的人们默哀。（全体起立）
    我们党内的一些最优秀的人物今天已经不能和我们在一起了。曾在艰苦的战争年代里领导过军队里的政治工作，而且特别是在党内以莫斯科党组织的杰出领袖闻名的亚历山大·塞尔盖耶维奇·谢尔巴科夫已经不在人世了。米哈依尔·伊凡诺维奇·加里宁，这位全国非常熟悉、我们的党非常爱戴的人物，也不能和我们在一起了。安德烈·阿历山德罗维奇·日丹诺夫，这位党内斯大林领导核心的天才代表之一，也已经逝世了。我们还怀念起另外一些已经不在人世的终生和党密切地连在一起的朋友和同志的名字。为了表示我们深深的敬意，让我们为他们默哀。（全体起立）
    我党的上一次代表大会是在一九三九年举行的。在那次大会以后的一段时期中，发生了许多具有巨大历史重要性的事件。
    大家都知道，我国人民的和平建设曾经因为德国法西斯主义对苏联发动背信弃义的进攻而中断。我们被迫暂时停止完成第三个五年计划任务的工作。我们曾不得不完全转移到战时轨道上，使一切都服从击溃进犯我国领土的敌人的目的。
    第二次世界大战对于年青的多民族的苏维埃国家说来，是最大的考验。同时，它也是对我党政策的正确性的全面考验。在战争年代中，苏联人民度过了许多艰苦的日子，忍受了重大的牺牲。但是，在这些事件的严重考验中，苏联并没有削弱或动摇。在我党的领导下，它变成一个比以前任何时候都更加巩固更加强大的社会主义国家了；它对自己的力量和自己的伟大事业的不可战胜性的信心也比以前任何时候都更为坚强了。
    第二次世界大战以法西斯侵略者的失败告终，这种结果在许多方面解放了欧亚两洲民族解放运动的力量。在新的条件下，特别是由于苏联在这个战争中所起的决定性作用，一连串国家就有了可能在战后时期从资本主义的发展道路转向一条新的道路，转向建立和发展人民民主国家的道路。这就标志着国际社会主义发展中一个新阶段的开始。
    这一切说明了为什么今天我们的党对于国家生活的各方面在思想上所起的指导性的影响会增长到这样的程度，说明了为什么我们的人民如此热烈爱戴他们的党、列宁斯大林的党。（长时间的鼓掌）
    这也说明了为什么现在我们的党享有如此崇高的国际威望，说明了为什么其他国家的劳动人民对我们的党、对斯大林的领导怀着这样大的信任和尊敬。（热烈的、经久不息的掌声）
    在战后时期的情况下，苏联集中力量来履行恢复和进一步发展国民经济的任务以及保持和巩固国际和平的任务。
    在这一次代表大会上，我们将讨论关于苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示。去年的成绩以及今年的经济成就都证明我们的人民在达到第五个五年计划的伟大目标方面已经取得了巨大的成就。为了要满怀信心地前进，我们必须与我们工作中的缺点进行更坚决的斗争；我们必须随时随地与自负和官僚主义的自满态度进行斗争，时时记住批评与自我批评是共产党员的不可缺少的战斗武器，时时记住这是我们提高群众积极性的方法——苏维埃的方法。
    代表大会的各项决议将鼓舞党和苏联全体人民不仅要完成而且要超额完成新五年计划。这将意味着苏维埃国家力量的进一步和全面的加强以及人民的——工人阶级、集体农民和苏维埃知识分子的——物质和文化水平的大大提高。苏联人民在执行五年计划时，也将在从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的道路上取得重大的新成就。（热烈的掌声）
    当然，我们并没有忘记：苏联是“处在各种国家中间的”，也没有忘记：还有奉行冒险、掠夺计划的帝国主义阵营存在，这个阵营正在武装自己，正在用一切办法煽动战争歇斯底里，并为发动另一次世界战争进行准备。这个反民主的侵略阵营是由正在执行垄断资本家的意志的美利坚合众国反动统治集团所领导的，这些贪得无餍的垄断资本家，为了谋取更大利润，正设法用强力建立世界霸权。对于在朝鲜的罪恶战争，对于夺取中国的台湾岛，对于把西德和日本变成附属国以及在西方和东方建立侵略性的军事联盟（例如北大西洋集团）来对付爱好和平的国家——苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家等应负主要责任的，就是美国的统治集团。
    然而，在最近几年来，特别是在战后时期，人口总共六亿的一连串的国家脱离了资本主义体系以后，世界资本主义体系所发生的显著削弱现象，是无法加以掩盖的。资本主义国家不能对付日益增涨的新的经济危机和失业人数大量增加的这些危险，也是无法加以掩盖的。这种危险同时也使这些国家间的对立和摩擦更加尖锐化，并且不可避免地使这些国家国内的阶级斗争愈趋紧张。战争贩子和他们的报界走狗竭力装作和平的爱好者，同时散布所谓苏联怀有侵略意图的诽谤谰言来欺骗资产阶级报纸的读者，然而不管他们怎样煞费心机，他们终归掩盖不了一个事实：各国人民的自由与民族独立所受到的经常的威胁，和平与国际安全遭受破坏的经常的威胁，恰恰是来自帝国主义阵营的侵略集团。今天的资本主义正处在总危机的阶段，正在加紧走向法西斯统治。它的前途的险恶与不可靠和它的内部弱点暴露得越明显，帝国主义阵营主要国家和它们鼓吹另一次战争的强盗宣传就越凶恶。
    与反动和侵略的阵营对峙的，是另一个阵营——国际保卫和平与民主的阵营。这个爱好和平的民主阵营，由坚持不渝地奉行保持和巩固国际和平的政策的苏联当之无愧地领导着。（经久不息的鼓掌）
    谈到这里，不能不指出：第二次世界大战的最重要的结果之一就是这样一个历史事实：苏联完全摆脱了在国际上孤立的处境。现在，人民民主国家、中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国正在和苏联一道维护和平与民主的事业。而且，今天保卫和平与民主的事业还得到强大的国际和平运动的支持，这个运动团结着亿万人民，其中包括资本主义国家的千百万和平拥护者。
    在为保卫和平而斗争时，我们苏联人民一时一刻也没有忘记必须保持应有的警惕，并随时准备给帝国主义好战阵营的任何侵略以有力的反击。不这样，保持和巩固和平的事业就不可能得到应有的维护。在这一方面，我们遵守着斯大林同志的已经成为各国人民维护和平事业的斗争的基础的著名指示：
    “如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”
    （经久不息的暴风雨般的掌声）“如果战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众能够得逞，欺骗了人民群众，将人民群众拖入另一次世界大战之中，那末战争就可能变得不可避免。”
    这一次党代表大会将显示苏联——胜利的社会主义的祖国——的力量已经壮大、增强了多少。这次代表大会还要执行它的主要任务：用马克思—列宁主义的光芒照亮今后继续前进的道路，我们将沿着这条道路，在我们国内取得社会主义的新的更辉煌的胜利，不仅如此，还要更广泛、更有力地团结国际民主力量，以保卫世界和平。（经久不息的鼓掌）
    我们党在举行这个第十九次代表大会的时候比以前任何时候都更强大、更团结了。（经久不息的鼓掌）我们党的，久经光荣战斗而且获得许多胜利的旗帜高高地举着，它召唤着我们人民前进，走向共产主义的胜利。（经久不息的鼓掌）我们党的领袖的名字，斯大林的名字，表示着整个进步人类最美好的希望和意愿。（长时间的热烈的欢呼。全体起立）
    列宁—斯大林党万岁！（热烈的鼓掌）
    第十九次党代表大会万岁！（热烈的鼓掌）
    祝我们敬爱的伟大的斯大林永远健康！（长时间的热烈的欢呼。全体起立。全场欢呼“伟大的斯大林万岁！”“斯大林同志，乌拉！”“光荣归于党和人民的伟大领袖斯大林同志！”“亲爱的斯大林万岁！”）
    接着，大会在莫洛托夫的建议下开始选举大会的各领导机构。
    米尔尼科夫同志发言，他代表各州、各边疆区和各加盟共和国代表团代表委员会，提议选举十六人组成的大会主席团。大会通过了这项动议。米尔尼科夫同志提名的大会主席团委员名单如下：安德里亚诺夫、阿里斯托夫、巴吉罗夫、贝利亚、布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇、科罗特钦科、库西宁、马林科夫、莫洛托夫、尼雅佐夫、巴托里切夫、斯大林、赫鲁晓夫、沙亚赫米托夫。
    当米尔尼科夫同志提到斯大林同志的名字时，大厅中响起了暴风雨般的掌声，全体起立。
    大会一致选出了这个主席团。
    莫洛托夫同志接着让布列日涅夫同志发言，布列日涅夫同志代表代表团代表委员会，提议选举下列各人组成大会秘书处：波斯克列比舍夫、伊格纳托夫、加皮托诺夫、穆杰拉则、米尔尼科夫、穆拉托夫、普萨诺夫、斯奈契库斯、斯米尔诺夫。
    大会一致通过了布列日涅夫同志提名的秘书处人员。
    穆杰拉则以代表团代表委员会的名义提议选举由下列人员组成的大会编纂委员会：波斯伯洛夫、加伏罗夫、伊里切夫、米哈依洛夫、苏斯洛夫、特里特亚科瓦。
    莫洛托夫同志把穆杰拉则同志的提议付表决，接着大会一致选出了穆杰拉则同志建议的编纂委员会。
    大会依据巴托里切夫同志的建议一致选出了大会资格审查委员会，委员有：别哥夫、阿鲁提诺夫、巴巴耶夫、柏里雅耶夫、布列日涅夫、瓦加波夫、格里辛、叶费莫夫、卡恩柏辛、吉利琴科、基塞列夫、开宾、拉柴柯夫、施基利亚托夫、雅科夫列夫等。
