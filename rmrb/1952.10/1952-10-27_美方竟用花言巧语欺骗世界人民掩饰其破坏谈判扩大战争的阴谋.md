Title: The U.S. is Actually Using Empty Rhetoric to Deceive the People of the World to Conceal its Conspiracy to Sabotage Negotiations and Expand the War

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 26th: The U.S. side is now lightly dismissing their adventurous behavior of sabotaging the armistice negotiations as "merely advocating a recess." They are clearly attempting to use this empty rhetoric to deceive other countries in the United Nations and to conceal the seriousness of the Korean situation from the world.

    In his reply to Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai on October 19, Clark, on the one hand, brazenly rejected the request of Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to resume the armistice negotiations, but on the other hand, said that the U.S. side "did not interrupt the negotiations." A day earlier, Austin, the head of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations, also described the U.S. side's suspension of the armistice negotiations as "merely requesting a recess." At the same time, the U.S. bourgeois news agencies and newspapers are also conducting the same deceptive propaganda. People can't help but ask: Since the U.S. side says that they have not suspended the negotiations, but only a recess, then what reason do they have to reject our side's legitimate and reasonable request for a resumption of the meeting? To escape this question, Clark put forward a condition for the resumption of negotiations, which is that our side "is willing to accept any proposal from the United Nations Command, or can put forward a written constructive proposal that meets the reasonable requirements of the United Nations Command." In other words, unless our side accepts the U.S. demand to forcibly detain prisoners of war, the negotiations will be suspended.

    It is very obvious that what Clark put forward is not a condition for resuming negotiations, but an ultimatum. If it is a negotiation, of course, both sides should express their opinions at the negotiating table and conduct discussions and consultations. Now Clark only allows our side to accept the U.S. opinion, and only allows us to express this acceptance in writing. Where in the world is there such a negotiation? Clark's reckless treatment of the Korean armistice issue, which is watched by the people of the world, with such an arrogant attitude, anyone with a little common sense can see that this is an act of deliberately sabotaging the negotiations. Even Hanson, a reporter for the United Press, could not help but say: "The future of the Korean armistice negotiations is hanging by a thread today, and Clark's reply to the communists can only make the armistice completely hopeless."

    The U.S. side's use of an indefinite recess to sabotage the armistice negotiations was actually planned long ago. As early as June 25, the "Wall Street Journal," the mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capitalists, had already revealed this conspiracy. The newspaper said that the U.S. "decision-makers intend to let the negotiations gradually disappear. They will increasingly adopt the method of walking out of the meeting, as our negotiators have done twice recently, until it is virtually equivalent to no negotiations at all." The U.S. conspiracy has been realized step by step since June. They started by absenting themselves, then a recess of three days, a week, and even ten days, and now they simply unilaterally implement an indefinite recess, making the armistice negotiations "virtually equivalent to nothing."

    The "Wall Street Journal" inadvertently revealed the U.S. conspiracy again on October 13. The newspaper said: "The United States has decided to get tough in Korea." "Suspending the truce talks is the first step... the second step will be for the United Nations to vote in the coming weeks to express 'unity,' in order to prove to the communists that the whole world supports us. These two steps will lead to the third, that is, the main action: a severe step." The various facts since the opening of the United Nations General Assembly prove that the U.S. government is acting according to this predetermined plan.

    In the United Nations General Assembly, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson has openly stated in his speeches on the 16th and 24th that the United States will continue its war of aggression against Korea and demanded that other countries participate more in this war and make futile sacrifices for U.S. monopoly capitalists. Outside the meeting, the U.S. government is stepping up this conspiracy. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 21st, U.S. government officials declared: "The United States has urged United Nations member states to send more ground, naval, and air forces to Korea to help the United States increase pressure on the communists." These officials revealed that in order to drive these countries to invest more people and money into this dangerous war gamble, the U.S. government actually lied and falsely accused the Korean and Chinese sides, saying that "unless the communists encounter greater military force, they will not negotiate a truce again"; "If the war continues, other countries should share a greater burden of manpower, material resources, and casualties." These officials also said: "When the truce talks began fifteen months ago, some countries were unwilling to send troops, and they should now be willing to face the 'fact' that this war will continue indefinitely."

    The U.S. government's determination to use expanding the war to replace peaceful negotiations is already very obvious. For this purpose, the U.S. side, on the one hand, brazenly ignores our side's fair and reasonable new proposal and refuses to resume the meeting, bringing the negotiations to the brink of collapse, and on the other hand, uses the empty rhetoric of "merely requesting a recess" to deceive and deceive the people of the world, in order to unknowingly push the whole world into a new war. The people of the world must be a hundred times more vigilant, expose the U.S. government's conspiracy to expand the war, and continue to fight for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

### 美方竟用花言巧语欺骗世界人民掩饰其破坏谈判扩大战争的阴谋

    美方竟用花言巧语欺骗世界人民掩饰其破坏谈判扩大战争的阴谋
    【新华社开城二十六日电】美方现在轻描淡写地把他们破坏停战谈判的冒险行为说成“只不过是主张休会”。他们显然企图用这种花言巧语来欺骗联合国中的其他国家，并向全世界掩饰朝鲜局势的严重性。
    克拉克在十月十九日给金日成、彭德怀两将军的复信中，一面悍然拒绝了金日成、彭德怀两将军的恢复停战谈判的要求，另一面却说，美方“并没有中断谈判”。在这以前一天，在联合国里的美国代表团团长奥斯汀，也把美方中止停战谈判的行为说成“仅仅是要求休会而已”。同时，美国资产阶级的通讯社和报刊也进行着同样的欺骗宣传。人们不禁要问：既然美方说他们并没有中止谈判，只是休会而已，那末他们有什么理由拒绝我方复会的正当和合理要求呢？为了逃避这个问题，克拉克提出了一个恢复谈判的条件，这就是要我方“愿意接受联合国军司令部的任何一项建议，或能提出适合联合国军司令部合理要求的书面的建设性建议”。换句话说，除非我方接受美方强迫扣留战俘的要求，谈判就此中止。
    事情十分明显，克拉克提出的不是什么恢复谈判的条件，而是一个最后通牒。如果是谈判，当然应由双方在谈判桌上发表意见，进行讨论协商。现在克拉克只许我方接受美方意见，并且只许用书面来表示这种接受，世界上那有这种谈判？克拉克用这种狂妄的态度轻率地对待全世界人民瞩望的朝鲜停战问题，稍明事理的人都可以看出这是一种蓄意破坏谈判的行为。甚至连美国合众社记者韩森都不能不说：“朝鲜停战谈判的前途今天已经系于一发，克拉克对共方的答复只有使停战完全绝望。”
    美方用无限期休会的办法来破坏停战谈判，其实是早就策划好了的。早在六月二十五日，美国垄断资本家的喉舌“华尔街日报”就已经透露了这个阴谋。该报说，美国的“决策者们打算让谈判逐渐消失。他们将会愈来愈多地采取中途退出会场的办法，如像我们的谈判代表最近所作的两次一样，直到最后实际上等于没有谈判为止”。美方这一个阴谋，已经从六月份开始一步一步地实现了。它们始则逃会，继之休会三天、一星期以至十天，现在索性片面实行无限期休会，使停战谈判“实际上等于没有”。
    十月十三日的“华尔街日报”又不小心地透露了美方的这个阴谋。该报说：“美国已决定在朝鲜强硬起来。”“中止休战谈判是第一步……第二步将是在以后数星期中联合国投票表示‘团结一致’，以便向共方证明全世界都支持着我们。这两步将引向第三个，亦即主要的行动：一个严厉的步骤。”联合国大会开幕以来的种种事实，证明美国政府正在按照这个预定计划行事。
    在联合国大会中，美国国务卿艾奇逊在其十六日和二十四日的演说中已经公开表示美国将继续侵朝战争，并要求其他国家更多地参加这个战争，为美国垄断资本家作无谓牺牲。在会外，美国政府正在加紧进行这种阴谋活动。据合众社华盛顿二十一日电报道，美国政府官员宣称：“美国已敦促联合国会员国家派遣更多的陆海空军前往朝鲜，协助美国对共产党增加压力。”这些官员透露了美国政府为了驱使这些国家更多地出人出钱投入这个危险的战争赌博中，竟然撒谎诬赖朝中方面说“除非共产党遭遇到更大的军事力量，他们不会再谈判停战”；“如果战争继续，其他国家应当分担更大的人力、物力与伤亡上的负担”。这些官员并且说：“当十五个月以前停战谈判开始时，有些国家不愿派遣军队，他们现在应当愿意来面对着这个战争将无限期延续的‘事实’了。”
    美国政府决心用扩大战争来代替和平谈判，已经是十分明显的事。为此目的，美方一方面悍然不理我方的公平合理的新提案，拒绝复会，使谈判濒于破裂，另一方面却用“只不过是要求休会”的花言巧语来蒙蔽和欺骗世界人民，以便不知不觉地将全世界推进新的战争中去。全世界人民必须百倍提高警惕，揭破美国政府扩大战争的阴谋，继续为和平解决朝鲜问题而斗争。
