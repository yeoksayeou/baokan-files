    I Realize the Greatness of the People's Government's Ethnic Policy
    Editor: The People's Daily published a message on September 8th entitled "An Example of the People's Government Implementing the Policy of Winning Over and Uniting Minority Nationalities – Xiang Qian, a Thousand-Household Head of the Angla Tribe in Qinghai Province, Returns to the People's Government." From this message, I deeply realized the correctness and greatness of the People's Government's ethnic policy. At the same time, it also tells us: we must closely unite around Chairman Mao, heighten our vigilance, and crush the conspiracies of imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries' remnants to undermine our national unity.
    Xiang Qian, a thousand-household head of the Angla tribe in Qinghai Province, incited by counter-revolutionary bandits, actually opposed the People's Government and attacked the People's Liberation Army, stubbornly rejecting the People's Government's seventeen attempts at persuasion and education, and fleeing into the mountains. However, because the People's Liberation Army resolutely implemented the policy towards minority nationalities, and the People's Government continued to win him over, Xiang Qian finally returned to the People's Government and resolved to correct his mistakes and perform meritorious service to atone for his crimes.
    I am a young person from a minority nationality. The Xiang Qian incident especially made me realize the greatness of the People's Government's ethnic policy and the happiness of being born in the era of Mao Zedong. I want to work hard to consolidate my revolutionary worldview, intensify my studies, and serve the people wholeheartedly.

    我体会到了人民政府民族政策的伟大
    编辑同志：九月八日人民日报登载了“人民政府执行争取团结少数民族的政策的一个范例——青海省昂拉部落千户项谦归向人民政府”的消息。从这个消息里，我深刻地体会到人民政府民族政策的正确伟大。同时，它也告诉我们：必须紧紧地团结在毛主席的周围，提高警惕，以粉碎帝国主义和国民党反动派残匪破坏我们民族团结的阴谋。
    青海省昂拉部落千户项谦因受反革命匪徒的煽惑，竟和人民政府为敌、袭击人民解放军，执迷不悟地拒绝了人民政府的十七次说服教育，逃往山里去。可是，由于人民解放军坚决执行了对待少数民族的政策，人民政府又继续争取，项谦终于归向人民政府，并决心痛改前非，立功赎罪。
    我是少数民族的一个青年，项谦事件，特别使我体会到人民政府民族政策的伟大和生长在毛泽东时代的幸福。我要努力巩固我的革命人生观，加紧学习，好为人民当勤务员。
