The Chinese people have stood up and established their own people's democratic country for three full years. In these three years, the achievements of New China in politics, economy, culture, and national defense are due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and their foundation is built on the unleashing of the people's initiative. The emergence and strengthening of this sense of ownership among the Chinese people is unprecedented. This is the most powerful proof of the superiority of the people's democratic system. We took three years as a period of recovery, and next, we will carry out large-scale construction. Facts tell us that we have recovered quickly, and now the conditions for construction are largely in place, and we can take big steps in the work of national industrialization. Such a bright future inspires every Chinese person. As an old intellectual who has undergone ideological remolding, I can celebrate the National Day on the eve of large-scale construction with a new spirit, and my joy is particularly unusual.

The most important thing is to grasp the most basic things and look at things from a pure perspective.

Wash away the dirt on the body with water. Water is the most primitive and simplest thing. Cleanse the dirt in the mind with truth. Truth is often the most basic principle. When society develops to a certain stage, when it moves from its prime to old age, and is about to give way to a new stage, red tape will follow and spread. To re-emphasize the most basic principles, one must first make an effort to weed out the chaotic set of ideas, so that the problem returns to simplicity. An old intellectual in the process of ideological remolding, when his enthusiasm is aroused and tends to be unrestrained, easily says such a sentence: It's not too late, let's start over! However, this bit of boldness is not enough. If you do not go through review and criticism, how can deep-rooted old ideas be discarded? These old ideas, for the old intellectuals in China, are partly absorbed from the modern capitalist countries of the West, and partly inherited from the remnants of Chinese medieval feudal society. In the minds of a few intellectuals, both often exist. No matter where the root belongs, whether it is a single reception or a combination, the essence of these ideas reflects some basic problems in a declining and decadent society, problems that the old society itself cannot solve and that need to be solved by revolution. The problem seems very complicated, as if it is boundless. In fact, it is just unwillingness to give up the privileges of rule and exploitation in the face of historical development. At this time, the revolutionary movement becomes a movement of "returning to simplicity"; the problem is raised again from its historical significance. Once the revolution is successful, the basic principles become clearer and are accepted by the general public, which becomes "liberation" in thought.

Since the defeat in the Opium War, the Chinese people have demanded progress. The general goal of demanding progress is independence and prosperity. For a long time, they tried hard to learn from the West, learning from the bourgeois democratic culture of the West. Saving the country, reform, and learning from the West were one and two and three, and three and two and one. Regarding imperialist aggression, some people were a little panicked, but most of the self-proclaimed advanced Chinese still believed in the West. Due to the eventual failure of the Xinhai Revolution, a movement on a national scale, suspicion arose, but they still did not give up learning from the West. It was not until the October Revolution in Russia broke out during the First World War and created the world's first socialist country that the Chinese people's thinking was greatly shaken. From the example of the Soviet Union, the advanced elements of China understood a principle, that is: the revolutionary potential of the great Chinese working people, invisible to foreigners, can erupt like a volcano as long as they are properly led, causing anyone who stands in the way to be defeated, whether the opponent is the domestic reactionary government or international imperialism. In this way, the advanced elements of China knew how to seek independence and prosperity, and how to resist imperialist aggression. Chairman Mao wrote in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": " The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped the advanced people of the whole world, including China, to use the proletarian world outlook as a tool to observe the destiny of the country and reconsider their own problems. Taking the road of the Russians - this is the conclusion." The organization of this advanced element in China is the Chinese Communist Party, and its most outstanding representative is none other than Chairman Mao. "A single spark can start a prairie fire." The Chinese Communist Party has gone through twenty-eight years, gone through a difficult and tortuous road, and finally, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, achieved the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the People's Revolution.

The so-called new scholars in the past all proclaimed themselves advanced Chinese people, and others did not argue with them, because compared with Chinese feudalist culture, that is, the so-called old learning, the new learning was progressive. Since the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism, the boundary between progress and non-progress is clear, and the Chinese intellectual circles then began to differentiate. The progressive ones moved forward and followed. The backward ones waited and watched, and finally fell behind forever. There are still those who were originally progressive but gradually became reactionary, who changed from opposing feudal culture to opposing the proletarian vanguard and joined forces with the reactionaries. This precisely illustrates that the ideology of the general intellectuals is limited by class interests. Most of today's old intellectuals who claim to be able to think independently have been baptized by the culture of Western capitalist countries and have a high estimate of the value of this culture. It is strange that some people in the West have long been talking about the "decline of Europe," but the Chinese have picked up a fragment of Western culture and regard it as a culture with a non-low value. It should be said that the saying "the West is in decline" is correct. That is because since the nineteenth century, the focus of European capitalist social culture has been placed on getting rich. So much wealth has been made that the working people have suffered unparalleled poverty. There is a very deep gap between the working class and the bourgeoisie, and it is absolutely inevitable and reasonable that the bourgeoisie will fall into the gap. In the midst of cultural atrophy, there is a need for revolution. Revolution has always been the driving force in the history of human cultural growth. Revolution is a process in which it will awaken new and great creativity.

Today's situation in China is that the revolution is stirring up the potential originally contained in the Chinese people with an overwhelming force.

Devote oneself to the revolution for the masses of the people; rely on the revolutionary masses to carry out the revolution; after the revolution is victorious, the people's regime is established and consolidated, and the masses of the people are allowed to exert their intelligence to create a better future, this is the entire process of the revolution, and it is also the essence of the revolution. Isn't this the most basic? Isn't this "in line with the trend of the world and in line with the needs of the people?"

We admire Mao Zedong Thought, saying that it "correctly and vividly combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution." This means that Chairman Mao applied the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to China, turning them into the revolutionary force of the Chinese masses. We admire Chairman Mao as a revolutionary expert. This means that Chairman Mao is most able to rely on the creativity of the Chinese revolutionary masses to advance the revolution step by step. Chairman Mao defined the New Democratic Revolution as "a revolution of the masses of the people against imperialism and feudalism under the leadership of the proletariat." The masses of the people mentioned in this formula, he refers to, mainly, workers and peasants. Therefore, he called the revolutionary democratic regime established by the New Democratic Revolution "a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." Chairman Mao regarded the peasant question as the central question to solve the leadership of the proletariat. Just think, aren't these the most basic questions? Isn't this put forward and linked appropriately on the point of "everything for the masses of the people?"

The culture that New China is currently trying to create is New Democratic culture. It is a national, scientific, and mass culture. The so-called mass means that culture should first serve more than 90% of the workers and peasants of the entire nation and become their culture. With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, New China is about to set off a high tide of cultural construction. This is not just theory, this is a fact that has already begun and whose results are already very significant.

I really like reading Chairman Mao's article "Concern for the Life of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods" written eighteen years ago. It is full of the revolutionary's concern and love for the revolutionary masses and grasps the basic essence of the revolution. That fiery enthusiasm is the secret to "being invincible." Chairman Mao said in this article: "Comrades, what is the real copper wall and iron wall? It is the masses, it is the masses of millions who genuinely and sincerely support the revolution. This is the real copper wall and iron wall, which no force can break, completely unbreakable. The counter-revolution cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolution. Unite millions of people around the revolutionary government, develop our revolutionary war, and we will be able to eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, and we will be able to seize all of China." Only by constantly working for the masses and constantly being supported by the masses can one develop such a revolutionary heroism.

New China is about to begin large-scale construction, and all conditions are already or are about to be in place. What we think and plan are the most basic things. And the most basic of the basic is: everything for the masses of the people, everything comes from the masses of the people themselves. This is the source of our strength.

    人民民主政权给了中国人民伟大的创造力以发挥的机会
    周炳琳
    中国人民站了起来，建立了自己的人民民主的国家，已满三年了。在这三年中，新中国在政治上经济上文化上和国防上各方面的成就，得力于毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导，而其基础则建在人民的积极性的发挥上。这种主人翁的气概在中国人民中的出现和增强，是空前的。人民民主制度的优越性，于此得到了一个最有力的证明。我们是以三年为恢复的期间，接下去便是进行大规模的建设。事实告诉我们，我们恢复得很快，现在建设条件已大体具备，即可大踏步进行国家工业化的工作。这样光明的前途鼓舞着每一个中国人。作为一个经过思想改造的旧知识分子，我能以新的气宇来祝贺大规模建设前夕的国庆，欢愉之情尤异寻常。
    最紧要的，是把握最基本的东西，回到纯朴上面来看事物。
    洗净身体上的尘垢，靠水。水，这是最原始最质朴的。洗清思想上的尘垢，靠真理。真理，往往是最基本的道理。社会发展到某一阶段，当它由壮年而进于衰老，要让位给新的阶段的时候，繁文缛节便跟着滋蔓起来。要把最基本的道理再提出来，必须先在混乱的一套思想中下一番剔除的功夫，使问题重返于朴素。一个旧知识分子在改造思想中，当他的热忱被鼓动起来而趋于豪放的时候，容易说出这样一句话：还不算迟，重新来过！但是，仅凭这一点豪放，是不够的。若不经过检讨和批判，则根深柢固的旧思想怎能被抛弃掉。这些旧思想，就中国的旧知识分子来说，有吸收自西方近代资本主义国家的，也有承袭自中国中世纪封建社会的残余的。在少数知识分子的思想中，往往两者兼而有之。无论根源属于那一方，无论是单收还是并蓄，这些思想就其本质来说，其所反映的乃是衰败没落的社会中一些基本的、而旧社会本身又无法解决要待革命来给以解决的问题。问题显得十分繁复，仿佛是无边无际。究其实，不过是在历史发展面前不肯放弃统治和剥削的特权而已。这时，革命运动适成了“返璞还真”的运动；问题再从其历史的意义上被提了出来。一旦革命成功，基本的道理显得更明白了，再为一般人所接受，这就成了思想上的“解放”。
    从鸦片战争失败时起，中国人便要求进步。要求进步的总目标，是独立和富强。有很长一个时期，是努力学习西方，学习西方资产阶级民主主义的文化。救国，维新，学西方，那是一而二而三，三而二而一的。对帝国主义的侵略，一部分人有过一点惊慌，但大部分号称先进的中国人还是迷信西方。由于辛亥革命那样全国规模的运动的终于失败，怀疑产生了，但依然没有放弃学西方。直到第一次世界大战期中俄国十月革命爆发，创立了世界上第一个社会主义国家，中国人的思想才大大地受了一次震撼。从苏联的实例，中国的先进分子懂得了一个道理，那就是：为外国人所看不见的伟大的中国劳动人民的革命潜力，只要领导得法，便可像火山一般爆发出来，使当之者披靡，无论对方是国内的反动政府还是国际的帝国主义。便这样，中国的先进分子知道了独立和富强该如何去求，帝国主义的侵略该如何去抵抗。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中写道：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”中国这种先进分子的组织便是中国共产党，其第一杰出的代表者，不是别人，正是毛主席。“星星之火，可以燎原。”中国共产党经历了二十八年，走过了艰难曲折的道路，终于在毛主席领导之下，取得了中国人民解放战争和人民革命的伟大胜利。
    从前所谓新学的人们，都自封为先进的中国人，别人也不与之争，因为比诸中国封建主义的文化即所谓旧学，新学是进步的。自从十月革命给我们送来了马克思列宁主义，进步与非进步，界限分明，中国知识界跟着便起了分化。进步的前进了，跟上去了。落后的意存观望，终于永远落在后面。尚有原来进步，逐渐变为反动的，则从反对封建文化一变而反对无产阶级先锋队，与反动派为伍起来。这正说明了一般知识分子的思想意识之为阶级利益所局限。凡今日之旧知识分子而自命能独立思考问题者，多半受过西方资本主义国家文化的洗礼，并对这种文化的价值有着不低的估量。可怪的，是西方早就有人在大谈其“欧洲的没落”，中国人摭拾了西方文化的一鳞半爪，却把它看成具有价值不低的文化。应该说“西方在没落中”这一说法是对的。那是因为十九世纪以来，欧洲资本主义社会文化的重点被安放在发财致富上。财发得那么大，使劳动人民遭到无比的穷困。劳动阶级与资产阶级之间有了一道很深的鸿沟，资产阶级之将坠入沟中，那是绝对不能免，也是理之当然的。在文化萎缩之中，正需要有革命。革命从来是人类文化成长史上的动力。革命是一个过程，在这个过程中，它会唤出新的伟大的创造力。
    今日中国的情形，正是革命以排山倒海之势激动了中国人民原就蕴藏着的潜力。
    为人民大众而献身于革命；依靠革命群众来进行革命；革命胜利了，人民政权建立并巩固起来了，让人民大众发挥其智能以创造其美好的将来，这是革命的全程，也是革命的要义。难道这不是最基本的吗？难道这不是“适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要”的吗？
    我们推崇毛泽东思想，说它“正确地和生动地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践结合起来”。这是说，毛主席运用马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论到中国来，使之变成中国大众的革命力量。我们推崇毛主席为革命能手。这是说，毛主席最能依靠中国革命群众的创造力，把革命一步一步向前推进。毛主席把新民主主义的革命规定为“在无产阶级领导之下的人民大众反帝国主义反封建主义的革命”。在这个公式里面所说的人民大众，他所指的，主要的是工人和农民。因此，他把由新民主主义的革命所建立起来的革命的民主政权，叫做“工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政”。毛主席把农民的问题看做解决无产阶级领导的中心问题。试想一想，这些都不是最基本的问题吗？这样提，这样联系，不是在
    “一切为人民大众”这一点上提得和联系得恰如其分吗？
    新中国现阶段所要创立的文化，是新民主主义文化。它是民族的科学的大众的文化。所谓大众的，意思就是说文化应首先为全民族百分之九十以上的工农劳动民众服务，成为他们的文化。随着经济建设高潮的到来，新中国即将掀起一个文化建设的高潮。这不只是理论，这是已经开了端而成绩已经十分显著的事实。
    我很喜欢读毛主席在十八年前写的“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”这一篇文章。它洋溢着革命者对革命群众的关心与热爱，把握着革命的基本要义。那一股火般的热忱就是“天下无敌焉”的秘诀所在。毛主席在这篇文章里说：“同志们，真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。在革命政府的周围团结起千百万群众来，发展我们的革命战争，我们就能消灭一切反革命，我们就能夺取全中国。”只有经常为着群众，经常受群众的拥护，才能长出这样的一个革命的英雄气概来。
    新中国即将开始大规模的建设，一切条件都已经或快要具备了。我们所想的所计划的都是最基本的。而基本之基本，则是：一切为了人民大众，一切出自人民大众自己。这便是我们的力量的源泉。
