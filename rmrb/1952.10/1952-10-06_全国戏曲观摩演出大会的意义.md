The first National Opera Performance and Observation Conference is scheduled to begin in Beijing on October 6th. More than twenty of the most popular opera genres from all over the country, and more than sixty new and old plays, will participate in this conference. This is an unprecedented grand gathering of Chinese opera performances. In this grand conference, we will not only make a concentrated review of our national opera heritage, but also make a comprehensive inspection of the opera reform work done in the past three years. This will inspire, encourage, and promote the widespread understanding of Chinese folk opera, the sorting out of old operas, and the creation of new operas. It will also inevitably have a huge impact on the improvement and development of the entire theatrical art. Therefore, the National Opera Performance and Observation Conference held this time is of great significance.

Our country's opera heritage is extremely rich. Almost every province, and even many regions smaller than provinces, has its own opera genre. The repertoire participating in this conference, except for a few new types of opera, is mostly local opera that is original to or adapted from various regions. Although they each have their own strong local color and different styles, they all come from the people, are created by the people, and equally reflect the Chinese people's diligence, bravery, and simple qualities, as well as their consistent spirit of resistance to violent rule and their desire for a peaceful and happy life. Naturally, they are also loved by the people.

Most of the existing opera genres in our country have a long history and certain achievements. We have gloriously received these rich heritages. In these heritages, a large part is worthy of our treasure, but precisely because of the long history, it is inevitable that they have been used by the reactionary ruling classes who used to exploit the people, and mixed with the toxins manufactured by the reactionary ruling classes. Since the founding of New China, because the people's government values opera loved by the people, and has given correct instructions and leadership for the work of opera reform, and because opera artists are respected by the government and the people, and feel the importance of their responsibilities, and earnestly strive to improve, in this performance and observation, we will see how to critically receive the valuable parts from the opera heritage and remove the mixed toxins.

This Performance and Observation Conference is not only a grand gathering of opera performances, but also a grand gathering of opera artists and leaders of opera reform work from all over the country. In addition to participating in performances and observations, they will make full use of this gathering opportunity to widely and earnestly exchange experiences and opinions on the performed programs and general opera reform work. Through this Performance and Observation Conference, we can see the achievements and deviations of the opera reform work in the past three years, and affirm and correct them separately. Local opera artists, who have always lacked the opportunity to observe other types of opera, may feel that they are not rich enough in terms of tunes and performance forms. After this Performance and Observation Conference, they will be able to widely observe each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, broaden their horizons, and develop the art they are familiar with. New types of opera, due to their short history, are still in the stage of gradual growth. Through this Performance and Observation Conference, they will definitely be able to absorb experience and accelerate their maturity. We hope that through the strong promotion of this Performance and Observation Conference, the entire theatrical art will move greatly forward in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and quickly present the beautiful scene of "a hundred flowers bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new"!

    全国戏曲观摩演出大会的意义
    丁西林
    第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会已决定从十月六日起在北京举行。参加这次会演的有来自全国各地的二十多种比较流行最广的剧种，六十多出新剧和旧剧。这是中国戏曲演出的一个空前的盛会。在这次这样规模宏大的会演中，我们将不仅对我国民族戏曲遗产作一次集中的巡礼，同时对三年来所做的戏曲改革工作也将作一次总的检查。这对于广泛地认识中国民间的戏曲，对于旧戏曲的整理，新戏曲的创造，都将产生启发、鼓舞与推动的作用。对于整个戏剧艺术的提高与发展也必然有巨大的影响。因此，这次所举行的全国戏曲观摩演出大会是有重要的意义的。
    我国的戏曲遗产是极其丰富的。差不多每一个省份以至于不少的小于省的地区都有自己的剧种。参加这次会演的剧目，除了少数的新型的歌剧外，大部分是各个地区原有的或经过改编的地方戏。它们虽然各有其浓厚的地方色彩和不同的风格，但都是来自民间，为人民所创造的，都同样地反映出中国人民勤劳、勇敢和朴实的品质以及一向对于暴力统治的反抗精神和追求和平幸福生活的渴望。很自然地它们也就同为人民所喜爱。
    我国现有的大多数的剧种都有其悠久的历史和一定的成就。我们光荣地接收了这些丰富的遗产。在这些遗产中，很大的部分是值得我们宝贵的，但也正由于有悠久的历史，就免不了受了以往惯于剥削人民的反动统治阶级的利用，羼杂了反动统治阶级所制造的毒素。新中国成立以来，由于人民的政府看重人民所喜爱的戏曲，对于戏曲的改革工作有了正确的指示和领导，由于戏曲艺人受到政府和人民的尊重，感觉到自己所负的责任的重大，恳切地力求改进，在这次观摩演出中，我们将看出怎样从戏曲的遗产中，批判地接收其值得宝贵的部分而清除其羼杂的毒素。
    这次的观摩演出大会除了是戏曲演出的盛大会演，同时也是全国戏曲艺人和领导戏曲改革工作者的盛大集会。他们除了参加演出与观摩之外，将尽量地利用这次聚会的机会，对于演出的节目以及一般的戏曲改革工作，广泛地、认真地交流经验，交换意见。经过这次的观摩演出大会，我们可以看到三年来戏曲改革工作的成绩和所发生的偏差，分别地加以肯定与纠正。一般的地方戏曲艺人，由于一向缺乏观摩别种戏曲的机会，可能在曲调与演出形式方面，各自感觉到不够丰富。经过了这次的观摩演出大会，他们将能广泛地互相观摩，取长补短，开扩自己的眼界，发展自己所熟悉的艺术。新型的歌剧，由于历史太短，尚在逐渐长成的阶段。经过这次的观摩演出大会，一定可以吸取经验，加速地使之成熟。我们希望经过这次观摩演出大会的有力推动，整个的戏剧艺术将向着毛主席所指示的方向，大大地前进一步，很快地呈现出“百花齐放，推陈出新”的美景！
