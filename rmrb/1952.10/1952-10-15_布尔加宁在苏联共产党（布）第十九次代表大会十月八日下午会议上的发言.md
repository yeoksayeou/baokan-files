Comrades! The issues and events discussed in the report of the Central Committee of our Party and the report on the directives of the Fifth Five-Year Plan are a novel and convincing demonstration of the infinite power and correctness of the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Clear evidence of this is: the achievements of the Soviet Union in communist construction; the establishment of a powerful people's democratic camp, and the growth and consolidation of communist and workers' parties.

The fact that many foreign communist and workers' party delegations are attending the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) is a fact that is particularly gratifying to all of us, and it illustrates the strength and solidarity of the world communist movement. (Applause) Looking back at the path the Soviet state has travelled since the Eighteenth Party Congress, we can point out with satisfaction and pride that our Party's policy has been correct, that it has always taken the interests of the people as its guide to action and has aimed to consolidate the Soviet state to the utmost.

In those years, the Party's policies and its practical activities in the economic, cultural, and military fields withstood the severe test of the Great Patriotic War.

Just as the Soviet people were working enthusiastically to implement the Third Five-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet national economy, just as our country was entering a new stage of development—the stage of gradual transition from socialism to communism—war suddenly descended upon our country. At that time, we had already achieved many outstanding labor achievements on the glorious path pointed out by the Eighteenth Party Congress.

The treacherous attack suddenly launched by the fascist aggressors immediately and fundamentally changed the situation at that time. Millions of Soviet people had to lay down their peaceful labor and take up arms to defend the great achievements of socialism and to save their motherland from the threat of fascist enslavement.

The Great Patriotic War was a matter of life and death for our country. Everyone knows that the question at the time was: either the Soviet Union would maintain its independence and the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union would remain free; or the Soviet Union would become a colony and the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union would become slaves of German imperialism. Furthermore, there could be no other result.

The Great Patriotic War was not only a war between two armies; it was also a war of the entire Soviet people against foreign aggressors. The purpose of the war was not only to eliminate the terrible threat hanging over our country, but also to assist the people of European countries suffering under the yoke of German fascism. This war was the most arduous war our country had ever experienced, so it required the Soviet people to contribute unbelievably intense efforts, and required them to endure serious losses and enormous sacrifices.

There is no need to elaborate here on the unparalleled difficulties our motherland suffered during the war years. The serious trials of the war are still fresh in our memories.

It is worth pointing out again and again that no bourgeois country that encountered such difficulties could have withstood a blow like the one the Hitlerite gang gave our country. Only the Soviet socialist state could have survived in such a situation, overcome unprecedented difficulties and achieved victory. (Prolonged applause)

What helped us resist the enemy's attack and then win the greatest victory in history?

Comrade Stalin taught us that modern war is a comprehensive test of the material and spiritual strength of every country. Only the country that has proven itself superior to the enemy in economic development and organization, in the experience, technology and fighting spirit of the troops, and in the endurance and unity of the people throughout the war can withstand this test.

In a word, the outcome of the war depends on the economic, spiritual and military potential of the belligerents. In all these respects, our Soviet country was much stronger than its enemy, Hitler's Germany, although Hitler's Germany, when attacking our country, used not only the economic and human resources of its own territory, but also the economic and human resources of the territories of France, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Hungary, Romania, Spain, and some other countries.

In the pre-war years, as now, the main efforts of the people of all nationalities in our country were devoted to peaceful construction. The Soviet Union has always resolutely pursued a foreign policy of peace, and at the same time our Party has never forgotten the threat of war, the conspiracies of imperialism, and under the wise leadership of Stalin, it has made our country and our army ready for active defense. Our preparation consisted primarily in creating sufficient material potential to ensure the rapid organization of military production once war broke out, to continuously supply the army and the population with food, and to supply industry with raw materials. Our Party accomplished this arduous task through the policy of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization implemented in the pre-war years of the three Stalin Five-Year Plans. It was in these years that we carried out historic changes, as a result of which we transformed a former agricultural country into an industrial country.

The completion of several Five-Year Plans for the development of the national economy greatly enhanced the defense capabilities of the Soviet state.

The results of the First Five-Year Plan proved that the Soviet Union had changed from a weak country without defense preparations to a country with strong defense capabilities, a country that could cope with all contingencies, manufacture all modern defense weapons on a large scale, and supply its army with these weapons in the event of an external attack.

The Second and Third Five-Year Plans ensured further industrialization of the country, thereby further strengthening the defense capabilities of the Soviet Union. We established an economic foundation that enabled us to be prepared to cope with the war, meet all the demands of the war, and withstand all the tests of four years of war.

In the pre-war era, we also took measures to strengthen the army. Thanks to the extensive work done in this area by the Party, the government and the entire Soviet people under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet army became a powerful force to be reckoned with. One of the main factors was the technical re-equipment of the army and the implementation of Stalin's instructions on the need to develop all kinds of weapons.

After the First World War, bourgeois military science was unable to solve the problem of the correct coordination of various weapons. All kinds of "theories" emerged advocating the maintenance of the superiority of this or that type of weapon or military equipment. In some cases, these "theories" were put into practice. For example, Hitler's military command paid special attention to the development of tanks, hoping to use tanks to achieve a quick victory in the war. The Second World War completely shattered this hope.

Even before the war, our country had established first-class artillery, powerful armored, tank and mechanized forces, a modern air force equipped with the latest equipment, and had begun to build a strong navy. This raised the defense capabilities and combat effectiveness of the Soviet armed forces to a high level.

The war began. It required the effective and correct utilization of existing material forces. Thanks to the Party's organizational work, this task was also completed extremely smoothly.

The conversion of our industry to war production, which began only in the first few days of the war, was basically completed in three or four months; and after about a year, the entire economy was switched to a war footing. Moreover, we should remember that this restructuring was carried out under unbelievably difficult circumstances, when large areas of our territory had been occupied by the enemy and many enterprises had to be moved to the east. All this caused great difficulties. It is enough to point out that the industrial production of the industrial states we temporarily lost at that time accounted for one-third of the entire industrial output of the Soviet Union in peacetime. More than 1,300 huge state enterprises were moved to the eastern regions of our country. At the same time, millions of people and large amounts of property were evacuated there. No belligerent country has ever had to switch its economy to a war footing under such difficult circumstances.

And in a short period of time, we established a well-organized, rapidly developing wartime economy. The basis of this wartime economy was not only the existing enterprises but also many newly built enterprises.

During the difficult years of the war, our industry and socialist agriculture both successfully completed their tasks.

This vividly proves the far-sighted policy of our Party, a policy capable of foresight and of intelligently solving the most complex problems. (Applause)

The war showed that the unity of our people is beyond the imagination of all capitalist countries.

Even before the war, the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union had already ensured the final elimination of the remnants of the exploiting classes, and guaranteed the unity of workers, peasants and intellectuals into a unified labor front. At that time, the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society had been formed, the friendship between the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union had been consolidated, and the national political life had been completely democratized.

When the enemy attacked our country, they counted on the instability of the Soviet rear and the Soviet system; they妄想that there would be conflicts between the workers and peasants of the Soviet Union, and quarrels and discord between the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. But the enemy's妄想did not come true. The result was completely different. The serious danger threatening the Soviet Union instead united the Soviet people more closely around the Communist Party, the Soviet government and Comrade Stalin, and aroused an unprecedented upsurge of Soviet patriotism among the people of our country. (Prolonged applause)

For the freedom and independence of the motherland, the Soviet people worked hard and faithfully in the rear, fought bravely and resolutely in the front, endured immeasurable hardships and made huge sacrifices. The war proved that our Soviet people are a heroic people. They are capable of creating miracles and of achieving victory in the most difficult trials. (Applause)

Our rear was the most stable rear in the world, it supplied not only the material needs of the army, but also the spiritual needs of the army; it was the source of the army's thoughts and feelings. Those thoughts are the most progressive thoughts - the thoughts of the Communist Party and the thoughts of Marxism-Leninism; those feelings are the unshakable and greatest confidence in our victory.

During the war, the Party explained to the Soviet fighters the meaning and purpose of the war; it cultivated their love for the motherland and their hatred for the enemy; it consolidated their fighting spirit and inspired them to achieve heroic feats.

The words of the Party and the words of the great Stalin gave the Soviet people a particularly powerful weapon - a firm belief in the certain victory of our just cause. Comrades, recall the most difficult days of autumn 1941, when the Hitlerite gang approached our capital, Moscow. Our enemies gloated as they prepared to celebrate victory. Those foreigners who are preparing for a new war today also thought at that time that the end of the Soviet regime was about to come.

In those difficult days, Comrade Stalin made a report on the 24th anniversary of the Great October Revolution on November 6, and the next day, he delivered a speech to the troops being reviewed on the reviewing stand of the Lenin Mausoleum.

Despite the difficult situation of the country and the army at that time, Comrade Stalin said that our victory was beyond doubt, and he pointed out the prospects for the war, which many people dared not anticipate. He said: The Soviet army will not only be able to crush the fascist aggressor gang, but also liberate the enslaved people of European countries.

No matter how highly one estimates the power of Comrade Stalin's words, it would not be an exaggeration. His words, like a searchlight, illuminated the road of our struggle, boosted the courage of our people and army, inspired all our friends abroad, and caused panic in the enemy camp.

Everything that happened was exactly as Comrade Stalin said.

(Stormy and prolonged applause) The Soviet army not only drove the enemy out of the country and completed its great liberation mission.

In his report, Comrade Malenkov spoke of the Soviet people's great trust in the Communist Party during the war. This was particularly evidenced by the large increase in the number of party members during the war. It is particularly significant that the period when the front situation was unfavorable to us was the period when the number of applications for party membership was the highest. This proves that our Party has the most solid ties with the masses, and it also proves the correctness of the Party's policy.

Of course, the correctness of the policy and leadership of our Party on the issue of military development is most fully embodied in the results of the last war, and thanks to the joint efforts of the people and the army, we achieved a complete victory over the enemy. This war proved that the Soviet army is an army with very modern equipment, well-trained command personnel and unparalleled morale and combat qualities. This war more forcefully proved that our army is a new type of army, a truly people's army, an army that has demonstrated the fraternal friendship of the people of all nationalities in our country, an army that has been nurtured in the spirit of internationalism. This war further proved that our army personnel are strong because they understand the justice of the war that our country had to wage, and they have the political consciousness that is known to be very important and guarantees victory.

Soviet soldiers are nurtured in the spirit of personal responsibility for defending the motherland, and they realize that their fight against Hitler's Germany is to defend their most precious things - the freedom and independence of the motherland. This lofty goal inspired the collective heroism of the soldiers - the sons of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. In his orders, Comrade Stalin repeatedly praised the brilliant achievements and heroism of the officers and soldiers of all arms of the service - infantry, artillery, tank crews, pilots, and sailors. All arms of our armed forces contributed to the victory over the enemy.

During the war, the Soviet army, under the leadership of its glorious commanders, won many brilliant victories, which our people should be proud of. These victories will live forever in people's hearts. Every victory is a glorious page in the military history of our people. (Stormy applause)

The crushing defeat of the German fascist army at Moscow thwarted the enemy's plan to encircle and capture our capital and the plan for a "lightning war"; in the great Battle of Stalingrad, the elite forces of the enemy army of 330,000 men were encircled, defeated and captured, which marked a fundamental turning point in the course of the Second World War; the defeat of the Hitlerite bandits at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains thwarted the enemy's plan to break through our defenses to invade our oil-producing areas and to attract our main reserve forces to the south; the Battle of Kursk ended the offensive strategy of the Hitlerite bandits; Stalin's ten heavy blows in 1944 determined that the war would be carried out outside our country and facilitated the total collapse of the Hitlerite group; the successive victories in the brilliant battles of East Prussia, the Vistula River and the Oder River, Budapest and Vienna in 1945; and finally the capture of Berlin - these were the most brilliant victories of our army, which led to the collapse of Hitler's Germany and its final unconditional surrender. We should also not forget the victorious campaigns of our army to defeat imperialist Japan.

These victories are the result of the heroic and outstanding achievements of ordinary combatants and commanders at all levels, as well as the heroic efforts of workers in the rear.

It was the Soviet people who achieved such brilliant victories with their labor and military skills as well as their blood and sweat, thus saving the country from enslavement. (Applause)

These victories are a concrete manifestation of Soviet military art, a masterpiece of Soviet officers and generals, a victory of Stalin's military science, and a victory of the strategic art of our leader and supreme commander, Comrade Stalin.

Comrade Stalin led the Soviet people and the armed forces in the struggle against foreign aggression. It was under his direct guidance and in accordance with his genius plan that we prepared and implemented the decisive battles in the Great Patriotic War, defeating Hitler's Germany and imperialist Japan.

When talking about the victory over the forces of fascism, we cannot fail to mention the fact that, in addition to the Soviet army, the glorious Polish army and the Czechoslovak corps, which were formed on Soviet territory during the war, also contributed to this victory. (Applause) The soldiers of the Polish and Czechoslovak armies fought alongside the Soviet army against the common enemy, demonstrating their courage and military skills in battle. Their victorious operations were repeatedly praised in the orders of the Supreme Commander Stalin at the time. In the final stages of the war, the Romanian and Bulgarian armies participated in the armed struggle against fascism and also demonstrated excellent combat qualities.

Our country grew stronger and more powerful in the war. The imperialists hoped that the Soviet Union would be weakened and exhausted, but this hope was dashed.

As a result of the victory of the Soviet Union, the people of Central and Southeast European countries had the opportunity to overthrow the landlord capitalist regime and establish people's democratic systems in their countries. As a result of the separation of these countries and some Asian countries from the capitalist system, one-third of humanity is now forever free from imperialist oppression.

The outcome of the war tells the world what a powerful force our Soviet Union is. The post-war years have again demonstrated the strength of our country.

In solving the post-war tasks, the Soviet people again encountered many difficulties, because the damage caused by the war to our national economy was very huge. The enemies of the Soviet Union again made their calculations based on this situation, hoping that we would not be able to overcome the difficulties we faced with our own strength. But the Soviet people, under the leadership of their Communist Party, overcame these heavy difficulties just as successfully, and not only had enough manpower and material resources to heal the wounds of the war, but also greatly developed industry, transportation, agriculture and culture, and greatly improved the material well-being of the working people. These were achieved during the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the results of which are familiar to everyone.

The victorious completion of the Fourth Five-Year Plan is another victory for our Party's policy.

The historical victories of the Soviet Union in wartime and the remarkable achievements in the post-war years have made our country even stronger than ever before.

It is no exaggeration to say that no bourgeois country has or ever could have had such a stable and unshakable domestic situation as the Soviet Union has today. (Applause)

Today, the Soviet Union is a consolidated and united socialist country with first-class industry, a well-developed transportation system and highly developed agricultural production.

Determining the economic life of our country is the state national economic plan aimed at increasing social wealth, continuously improving the material and cultural standards of the working people, consolidating independence and strengthening the defense capabilities of the Soviet Union.

The completion of these tasks is the purpose of the draft directives on the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan (Fifth Five-Year Plan) submitted to the Party Congress for discussion. This draft embodies the great power of the socialist system and reflects the basic economic law of socialism, which is to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by continuously developing and improving socialist production on the basis of the highest technology.

This is first demonstrated by the following provisions of the draft directives: in five years, industrial production will increase by about 70 percent, the total industrial output will increase by an average of about 12 percent per year, and the increase in the production of means of production will be absolutely dominant. As a result, by 1955, industrial output will be three times that of 1940.

This can also be demonstrated by provisions such as the extremely rapid development of major industries; an increase in national income of at least 60 percent in five years, an increase in the real wages of workers and staff of at least 35 percent, an increase in the income of collective farmers of at least 40 percent, a significant expansion of trade, and other indicators.

The tasks stipulated in the draft directives on the Fifth Five-Year Plan guarantee the further vigorous development of advanced technology, machines, machine tools and precision instruments, which in turn requires a corresponding increase in engineers, technicians and worker cadres with a high level. This is of great and positive significance for further consolidating our economy and improving our defense forces, because modern warfare requires many weapons manufactured according to the latest achievements of science and technology.

The draft directives stipulate that the output of the most important agricultural products should increase by 40 to 70 percent, and livestock breeding should also be greatly increased. This shows that our agriculture will have new development in the coming years.

Of great importance to the country are the educational tasks stipulated in the directives: greatly expand secondary universal education and begin to implement various technical education in secondary schools. The completion of these tasks will further improve the cultural level of our people and will provide a large number of new cadres - well-educated, technically knowledgeable communist builders and defenders of the motherland. As Comrade Stalin said, universal compulsory technical education is necessary to enable members of society to freely choose their professions without being bound to a certain profession for life.

The draft directives on the Fifth Five-Year Plan concretely embodies the Leninist-Stalinist national policy of our Party, which aims to strengthen the friendship between all nationalities and further improve the economy and culture of the various union republics, just as the previous Five-Year Plans have also embodied this policy. The comrades who spoke here put forward many powerful facts and convincing figures to illustrate the rapid development of the economy and culture of the various union republics of the Soviet Union, especially in the post-war years. During this new Five-Year Plan, the national economies of Central Asia, Transcaucasia, Belarus, Ukraine and all other republics will be further greatly developed.

The new Five-Year Plan stipulates huge tasks for the development of the economic and cultural sectors of the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian Soviet Socialist Republics. The people of these republics only recently joined the fraternal Soviet family before the war, and they had lived under the rule of bourgeois governments until then.

During the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the Baltic Visueva Republic, although severely damaged in the war, still made great achievements in developing their national economy, especially their industry. The directives on the Fifth Five-Year Plan guarantee the further development of the national economy of these republics.

The draft directives on the Fifth Five-Year Plan is a new proof that the Soviet people are fully engaged in peaceful construction and have no intention of war. In saying this, we do not hide the fact that our economy can be transformed into a wartime economy in the shortest possible period.

Under the leadership of our Party, the Soviet people are gradually transitioning from socialism to communism.

Comrade Stalin's latest masterpiece "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" points out that in order to prepare for this transition, it is necessary to reliably ensure the continuous growth of social production as a whole, first of all the development of the production of means of production, to raise the collective farm ownership to the level of public ownership by means of gradual transition, and also to replace commodity circulation with product exchange by means of gradual transition, and finally to achieve the social and cultural upsurge that can guarantee the comprehensive development of physical and mental strength of all members of society.

The plan for the development of our country stipulated in the draft directives is exactly the direction indicated by Comrade Stalin. The completion of the tasks stipulated in the directives of the Fifth Five-Year Plan will guarantee new victories for the people of our country in all aspects of communist construction.

The tasks stipulated in the new Five-Year Plan place significant demands on the Party, the Soviets, economic organizations, trade unions and communist youth league organizations, and instruct them to mobilize the broad masses of working people to complete and overfulfill the new Five-Year Plan. Comrade Stalin said, "It would be foolish to think that a production plan is just a table of figures and a list of work tasks. In fact, a production plan is the living practical action of millions of people. What makes our production plan a reality is the millions of workers who are creating a new life."

In the past, the Soviet people have more than once expressed their indomitable determination not only to complete but also to overfulfill the national economic plan, and as a result, these plans have been completed ahead of schedule. The determination of our people can be explained by the fact that they believe that the economic plan reflects their vital interests, and they clearly see that the completion of the plan will strengthen our Soviet state, increase our public wealth, improve the lives of Soviet men and women, and that every year and every new Five-Year Plan brings our country closer to the goal we have identified - communism. (Applause)

The Soviet people's determination to complete and overfulfill the national economic plan is manifested in the development of socialist competition on a national scale. There is no doubt that in the era of the new Five-Year Plan, this tried and tested method of communist labor will also be the method used by millions of Soviet people to do their best to increase labor productivity and reach and exceed all production targets ahead of schedule, making them reach a high level.

The experience of many years of socialist construction tells us that economic achievements are directly proportional to the ideological training of our cadres and all party members, the level of Marxist-Leninist cultivation, and the level of political awareness of the broad masses of working people.

In recent years, our Party has done a lot of work in the development and improvement of the quality of ideological work. The tasks of communist construction require further improvement of the Party's ideological work, further development of propaganda work and improvement of the theoretical level of Party members. This is one of the most important prerequisites for our progress.

Comrades! The report on the work of the Central Committee made by Comrade Malenkov to the Party Congress gave a profound and comprehensive analysis of the international situation. One of the most typical characteristics of the current international situation is that it is becoming more tense and strained due to the preparations of imperialism to launch a war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

Taking advantage of this situation that occurred after the war, the United States openly began to pursue a policy aimed at establishing American rule in the world.

Recently, American monopoly capitalists have been trying to cover up their policy with beautiful phrases such as "cooperation and concerted action of the non-communist world." But despite the best efforts of these gentlemen, others can see very clearly that their plans and intentions are no different from those of Hitler and his followers, who also tried hard to seek world hegemony but were later shattered. The new ambitious people who seek world hegemony may remember this.

In recent years, the number of ground forces and air forces of all aggressor countries has increased significantly. For example, the total number of the US armed forces has increased more than six times compared to 1939. The British regular army has increased two and a half times compared to before the war. With the US request, West Germany and Japan are establishing armed forces, and in addition, they have pieced together a so-called European army, which, according to the imperialist plan, will be greatly expanded by the end of this year.

Under the cover of hypocritical speeches about loving peace, the US government is extensively organizing and building military bases abroad - mainly in West Germany, France, Britain, French Morocco, Turkey and Japan. At the same time, the United States is establishing naval bases mainly on foreign territory, first of all in the territorial waters of the North Atlantic Group. It is not difficult to see that the United States is building all these military bases in order to use these bases to encircle the Soviet Union in order to create favorable conditions for itself in the event of a war.

The generals of the Atlantic Group have recently shown great belligerence, and they are constantly rushing around the countries at the behest of their Wall Street masters.

They inspect the army here, hold land, sea and air exercises there, and窥探the Soviet border in another place. In the past three months alone, a dozen famous American and British soldiers have been to the Soviet-Turkish border.

The appearance of these jackals in uniform on our borders is naturally not accidental. This is a link in the imperialists' activities to prepare for an anti-Soviet war.

This also shows that the current Turkish government has completely lost its sense of responsibility for the fate of the Turkish people and has become an appendage of the US-British group, which is dragging Turkey onto the road of dangerous gambling.

Not long ago, the Atlantic Group held joint naval exercises in the area from the northern coast of Norway to the island of Bornholm in Denmark, not far from the Soviet border. Nine countries participated in this exercise, and none of them, except Norway and Denmark, had a direct interest in the Baltic Sea region.

The actions and intentions of the imperialist camp headed by the current US government are obviously aggressive and provocative.

Of course, we should not underestimate the strength of the aggressive camp, but we should not overestimate them either. This strength itself contains all the weaknesses of their mother, the imperialist system.

People must not ignore the fact that the capitalist camp is composed of countries with unequal status and is divided by serious internal contradictions. The heads of this camp, waving the flag of anti-communism, insist that they are creating a "large family of free countries." But strictly speaking, what can the so-called large family of free countries mean? In fact, the people of the countries that have been pulled into the US axis do not want to participate in this "large family." In fact, they are not interested in the prospect of a new war for the robber interests of American monopoly capitalists.

Therefore, the ruling groups of capitalist countries use a web of lies to trap the people, spreading lies about the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, clamoring for the need to "liberate" these countries from communism. In this regard, the representatives of the US ruling group have shown particular enthusiasm, and they have even clamored for the use of armed forces to "liberate" a large part of Europe and Asia, and they have specified that these countries are Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, China, the Mongolian People's Republic and other countries.

This crazy plan has caused astonishment even in the bourgeois camp. The more sober-minded heads in this camp asked: Do the people of these countries want to be "liberated"?

This is a reasonable question. The people of these countries really do not need the help of these "liberators." If these countries really need to get rid of someone finally, it is the spies, saboteurs and terrorists that the United States is desperately sending there. (Applause) Besides, no other "liberation" is needed, especially because the whole world knows what "American-style liberation" means. In the past, this was the inhumane extermination of the Indian tribes in North America; the brutal massacre of the Filipino people; and armed intervention in the young Soviet republic. At present, "American-style liberation" is the piratical war of plunder in Korea, the barbaric bombing of peaceful cities and villages in Korea, and the killing of women and children with bombs and vicious bacteria.

The American imperialists are covering up their predatory acts with lies about "liberation." But lies cannot save them. Lies have short legs. With these short legs, you can't go far. (Applause)

The US government is currently deeply troubled by the lack of "political and spiritual solidarity" in the Atlantic countries. Obviously for this reason, it is touting the US assistance to the countries of this group. But everyone understands what US "assistance" means. It means: the United States is openly plundering these countries and placing them under US rule. When the US government gives "assistance" to its vassal states, it is following the conventions of the capitalist world: "Give your neighbor what is useless to you." They are thus dealing with dilapidated items and outdated military equipment. They are using military and economic assistance to other countries to force these countries to actively prepare for another war.

Comrade Stalin said, when describing the current situation in the capitalist world: "On the surface, everything seems to be 'safe and sound': the United States has forced Western Europe, Japan and other capitalist countries to implement rationing; Germany (West Germany), Britain, France, Italy, and Japan have all fallen into the iron claws of the United States, obediently carrying out the orders of the United States. But it would be wrong to think that this 'safe and sound' situation will be preserved 'forever', that these countries will endlessly endure US rule and oppression, that they will not try to break free from US slavery and embark on the road of independent development."

The contradictions and internal difficulties between the guys in the North Atlantic Group are preventing the realization of their aggressive plans, and our powerful peace-loving democratic camp is making their plans even more impossible.

The working people of the people's democratic countries, under the leadership of their communist and workers' parties, have made significant achievements in economic, political and social aspects. These achievements vividly prove that the countries of the democratic camp are now much stronger than they were before the war under the old anti-people regimes.

Constant economic cooperation has been organized between the countries of the people's democratic camp. This cooperation is built on the basis of a sincere desire to help each other and achieve universal economic development, thus ensuring the rapid development of the industries of these countries.

This is the difference between the relations between countries in the capitalist world and the relations between countries in the socialist world. There, in capitalist countries, their relations are relations of domination and subordination, as a result of which economically weak countries are destroyed and enslaved. But here, they are equal relations, brotherly and friendly relations, which result in universal economic development.

The peace-loving democratic camp, which stretches from the Elbe River to the Pacific Ocean, is filled with enthusiasm for peaceful construction and a desire to maintain lasting peace. But it is very important to point out that, when necessary, the peace-loving democratic camp has fully modernized and sufficiently powerful armed forces.

Let the capitalist bigwigs understand and keep in mind: a new world war is more dangerous for capitalism than for the democratic camp. If they launch a new world war, they will be met with a strong armed counterattack from all freedom-loving people, and the freedom-loving people will use all their strength to eliminate capitalism forever. (Stormy applause)

Therefore, we must always maintain the highest vigilance and be ready to repulse the aggressors at any time. Historical experience tells us that the weaker the position of imperialism, the greater the danger it poses of launching military gambling, and the more eagerly the imperialists will try to eliminate the Soviet Union in order to save their precarious situation.

Therefore, we must continue to strengthen our army, air force and navy in various ways. The constant military readiness of our armed forces and the armed forces of the entire democratic camp is the most reliable guarantee for preventing all contingencies.

We maintain the army and navy to defend our motherland and ensure the peaceful labor of the Soviet people. We advocate peace, we pursue a policy of peace, and we pursue a policy of avoiding war. But all the proposals made by the Soviet government to ensure peace have been rejected by the US government and its yes-men. These proposals were rejected because they hinder the actions and aggressive plans of the warmongers. As a result, they issued vicious threats and the most absurd intimidation to the Soviet Union.

Our answer is simple:

You are wasting your energy, imperialist bigwigs! The great Soviet people are not so easily frightened, nor will they be intimidated by threats. If things are done too much, our people have the strength to rise up to defend themselves and defend the interests of their motherland. (Stormy applause) The armed forces of the Soviet Union have the strength to repel any aggressor in accordance with all the rules of Soviet military art. (Stormy applause)

Comrades! Just as our Party Congress is meeting, the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution is approaching.

On the eve of the October Revolution, Russia was on the verge of destruction: it faced the danger of losing its national independence and becoming a colony of foreign imperialists. What made the country fall into this situation was the ruling class of Russia - the landlords and capitalists.

The Great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in the history of our motherland. After organizing the alliance of the working class and the working peasants, our Party finally overthrew the capitalists and landlords in this revolution, organized the dictatorship of the proletariat, abolished capitalism, eliminated the exploitation of man by man, and guaranteed the establishment of a socialist society.

Under the leadership of the Party, the people of our country completed the great Lenin's instruction to turn our country into a rich and powerful country.

At present, the main task of our Party is to build a communist society through the gradual transition from socialism to communism. An important step on this road is to complete Stalin's Fifth Five-Year Plan.

The victory of the people of our country is of world historical significance. We have long been at such a stage that the working people of the world have seen the concrete results of the great work we have done. Due to the achievements of socialist construction, our country has become a magnet attracting all working people and all progressive people in the world. All just people believe that our country is an example of what working people can achieve when they manage the country themselves and under the leadership of a party like ours.

The strength of our Party lies in the advanced theory that guides it, the theory of Marxism-Leninism; the strength of our Party lies in its inseparable flesh-and-blood ties with the people, in its ability to inspire the masses to fulfill historical tasks; the strength of our Party lies in its strong unity.

When holding the 19th Congress, our Party is closely united around the Leninist-Stalinist Central Committee, and is closely united around Comrade Stalin. (Stormy applause)

Long live the great and invincible banner of our Party, the banner of Lenin-Stalin! (Prolonged applause)

Long live our leader and teacher, the great Stalin! (Stormy and prolonged applause. All stand up. Everyone cheers: "Long live the great Stalin, Ura!")

    布尔加宁在苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会十月八日下午会议上的发言
    同志们！我们党的中央委员会的报告以及关于第五个五年计划的指示的报告里所讨论的问题和事件，是新颖而又令人信服的证明，证明了马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的伟大学说的无穷力量和正确性。关于这一点的明显证据是：苏联在共产主义建设方面的成就；强大的人民民主阵营的建立，以及共产党和工人党的成长和巩固。
    特别值得我们大家高兴的事实是，有许多外国共产党和工人党的代表团列席苏联共产党（布尔什维克）代表大会，这一事实说明了世界共产主义运动的力量和团结一致。（掌声）回顾一下苏维埃国家自第十八次党代表大会以来所经历的道路，我们可以满意而骄傲地指出，我们党的政策是正确的，它始终以人民的利益为它的行动指南，并以极力巩固苏维埃国家为其目的。
    在那些年代里，党在经济、文化、军事各方面的政策和它的实际活动经起了伟大的卫国战争的严重考验。
    正当苏维埃人民在热情地工作，以实现发展苏联国民经济的第三个五年计划的时候，正当我们的国家进入了一个新的发展阶段——由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的阶段——的时候，战争突然降临到我们的国家。那时，在第十八次党代表大会所指出的光辉的道路上，我们已经获得了许多杰出的劳动成就。
    法西斯侵略者突然发动的背信弃义的进攻立即根本改变了当时的局势。千百万苏维埃人民不得不放下他们的和平劳动，拿起武器去捍卫伟大的社会主义成就并使他们的祖国免受法西斯奴役的威胁。
    伟大的卫国战争对于我们的国家来说是一个生死攸关的问题。每个人都知道，当时的问题是：或者是苏联保持它的独立，苏联各族人民仍然保持他们的自由；或者是苏联沦为殖民地，苏联各族人民变成德国帝国主义者的奴隶。此外，不可能有其他的结果。
    伟大的卫国战争不仅是两国军队之间的战争；而且是全体苏维埃人民反抗外国侵略者的战争。战争的目的不仅是消除笼罩在我国头上的可怖的威胁，而且是援助在德国法西斯的枷锁下痛苦呻吟的欧洲各国人民。这场战争是我们的国家所经历过的最艰苦的战争，所以它要求苏维埃人民贡献出令人难以置信的紧张努力，要求他们忍受严重的损失和巨大的牺牲。
    在这里用不着详谈我们的祖国在战争年代里所遭受的无比困难。战时的严重考验对于我们仍然是记忆犹新的。
    值得一再指出的是：没有一个遭遇到这样的困难的资产阶级国家经受得起像希特勒匪帮给予我国的那样一个打击。只有苏维埃社会主义国家才能在这样的情况下支持下去，渡过空前的难关并获得了胜利。（经久不息的掌声）
    什么东西帮助我们抵挡住敌人的进攻并接着赢得了历史上最大的胜利呢？
    斯大林同志教导我们说，现代战争是对每一个国家的物质与精神力量的全面考验。经得起这种考验的只有在经济发展和组织上、在部队的经验、技术和战斗精神上、在整个战争期间人民的忍耐力和团结上都证明了胜过敌方的国家。
    一句话，战争的结果取决于交战双方的经济的、精神的和军事的潜力。在所有这些方面，我们的苏维埃国家比起它的敌国希特勒德国来要强大得多，虽然希特勒德国在进攻我国的时候，不仅使用自己领土上的经济和人力资源，而且还使用法国、捷克斯洛伐克、奥地利、比利时、荷兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、西班牙和其他一些国家领土上的经济和人力资源。
    在战前的年代里，和在现在一样，我国各族人民的主要努力是从事和平建设。苏联一贯坚决奉行爱好和平的外交政策，同时我们的党从来没有忘记战争的威胁、帝国主义的阴谋，它在斯大林的英明领导下使我们的国家和军队准备着积极的防御。我们的准备首先在于创造充分的物质潜能，以便一旦战争爆发，可以保证迅速组织军事生产，源源不断地以食品供应军队和居民，以原料供应工业。我们党是通过在战前三个斯大林五年计划的年代里执行的全国工业化和农业集体化的政策来完成这一艰巨任务的。就是在这些年代里我们实行了历史性的变革，结果把原先的一个农业国变成了一个工业国。
    几个国民经济发展五年计划的完成大大增强了苏维埃国家的国防力量。
    第一个五年计划的结果证明：苏联已从一个没有国防准备的弱国变为一个防御力量强大的国家，变为一个可以应付一切意外事件、大规模制造一切现代防御武器以便在受到外来的进攻时能以这些武器供给它的军队的国家。
    第二个五年计划和第三个五年计划的头几年保证了全国进一步的工业化，从而更进一步加强了苏联的国防力量。我们建立了一个经济基础，使我们可以有准备地应付战争，满足战争的一切要求，通过四年战争的一切考验。
    在战前时代，我们还采取了加强军队的措施。由于党、政府和全体苏维埃人民在斯大林同志的领导下在这方面做了广泛的工作，苏联军队变成了一支强大的不可轻视的力量。其中一个主要的因素是在技术上重新装备军队和执行了斯大林关于必须发展各种武器的指示。
    在第一次世界大战以后，资产阶级军事科学没有能力解决各种武器正确配合的问题。主张保持这一种或那一种武器或者军事装备的优势的形形色色的“理论”出现了。在某些情况下，这种“理论”付诸实施了。譬如，希特勒的军事指挥部就特别注意发展坦克，希望在战争中用坦克迅速取得胜利。第二次世界大战完全粉碎了这种希望。
    甚至在战争以前，我国就已建立了第一等的炮兵，强大的装甲、坦克和机械化部队，拥有最新式装备的现代化空军，并已开始建立一支强大的海军。这就把苏联武装部队的防御力量和战斗力提高到高度的水平。
    战争开始了。它要求有效地并正确地利用现有的物质力量。由于党的组织工作，这个任务也极其顺利地完成了。
    我国工业的转向战时生产，在战争的头几天才开始，经过三、四个月的时间就已基本上完成；而经过一年左右的时间，整个经济就转上了战时轨道。而且，我们应该记住，这种改组工作是在令人难以相信的困难情况下进行的，当时我们大片的领土已被敌人占据，许许多多的企业不得不向东迁移。所有这一切又引起了很大的困难。只消指出一点就可以说明问题：我们当时所暂时失去的各个工业州的工业生产在平时占苏联整个工业产量的三分之一。一千三百多个巨大的国家企业向我国东部地区迁移。同时数以百万计的人民和大量的财产也疏散到那里。从来没有任何一个交战国家须要在这样的困难情况下把它的经济转上战时轨道。
    而在短短的时期内，我们建立了一个组织健全的、发展迅速的战时经济。这个战时经济的基础不仅有现有的企业而且有许多新建的企业。
    在战争的艰苦年代中，我们的工业和社会主义的农业都胜利地完成了自己的任务。
    这生动地证明了我们党的有远见的政策，能够高瞻远瞩、并且明智地解决最复杂的问题的政策。（掌声）
    战争说明我国人民的团结是超出一切资本主义国家的想像的。
    甚至在战争以前，社会主义在苏联的胜利就已经保证了剥削阶级残余的最后消灭，保证了工人、农民和知识分子团结成一条统一的劳动阵线。当时，苏维埃社会的精神和政治团结已经形成，苏联各族人民之间的友谊已经巩固，全国政治生活已经完全民主化了。
    敌人在进攻我们国家的时候指望苏联后方和苏维埃制度会不稳固；他们妄想苏联的工人和农民会发生冲突，苏联各族人民之间会发生争吵与不和。但是敌人的妄想并没有如愿以偿。结果完全不是那么一回事。威胁苏联的严重的危险反而使苏联人民更紧密地团结在共产党、苏联政府和斯大林同志的周围了，而且激起了我国人民的苏维埃爱国主义的空前高涨。（历久不息的掌声）
    为了祖国的自由和独立，苏联人民在后方艰苦地、忠实地工作，在前方奋发果敢地作战，他们忍受了无法估量的艰苦，付出了巨大的牺牲。战争证明了我们苏维埃人民是英雄的人民。他们能够创造奇迹并在最艰苦的考验中取得胜利。（鼓掌）
    我国后方是世界上最稳固的后方，它不仅供应了军队的物质方面的需要，而且也供应了军队的精神方面的需要；它是军队思想和感情的源泉。那些思想是最进步的思想——共产党的思想和马克思—列宁主义的思想；那些感情是对于我们胜利的不可动摇的和最大的信心。
    党在战争期间向苏维埃战士们解释了战争的意义和目的；它培养了他们对祖国的爱、对敌人的恨，它巩固了他们的战斗精神并鼓舞他们取得英雄的业绩。
    党的话和伟大的斯大林的话使苏维埃人民得到了一个特别有力的武器——对于我们正义事业一定胜利的坚强信心。同志们，回想一下一九四一年秋天最艰苦的日子吧，那时，希特勒匪帮迫近了我国的首都莫斯科。我们的敌人得意忘形地准备庆祝胜利。今天正在准备新战争的那些外国人当时也以为苏维埃政权的末日马上就要到来了。
    在那些困难的日子里，斯大林同志在十一月六日作了关于伟大的十月革命二十四周年的报告，第二天，他在列宁陵墓检阅台上向受检阅的队伍发表了演说。
    尽管国家和军队在当时的处境颇为困难，斯大林同志说，我们的胜利是毫无问题的，并且他指出了战争的远景，这种远景是许多人所不敢预料的。他说：苏联军队不仅能够粉碎法西斯侵略者匪帮，而且也能够解放欧洲被奴役的各国人民。
    斯大林同志这些话的力量无论怎样高估，也是不会过分的。他的话像探照灯一样，照明了我们斗争的道路，提高了我国人民和军队的勇气，鼓舞了苏联国外的所有朋友们，并引起了敌人阵营内的惊慌。
    所发生的一切事情正是斯大林同志讲的那样。
    （暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）苏维埃军队不仅把敌人赶出国境并且完成了它的伟大的解放使命。
    马林科夫同志在他的报告中谈到我国人民在战争期间对于共产党的极大的信赖。战争期间党员人数大为增加特别证明了这一点。特别显著的事实是：前线局势对于我们不利的时期，正是申请入党的人数最多的时期。这证明了我们的党和群众有着最牢固的联系，同时也证明了党的方针的正确。
    当然，在军事发展问题上，我们党的政策和领导的正确性，最详尽充分地体现在上一次大战的结果上，由于人民和军队的共同努力我们获得了对敌人的完全胜利。　这次战争证明，苏联的军队是一支拥有十分现代化的装备、久经锻炼的指挥人员以及无与伦比的士气和战斗品质的军队。这场战争更有力地证明了我们的军队是一支新型的军队，是一支真正的人民的军队，是一支表现了我国各民族兄弟友爱的军队，是一支以国际主义精神培育起来的军队。这次战争进一步证明了，我们军队的人员是坚强的，因为他们了解我们的国家不得不进行的战争的正义性，并且具有大家知道非常重要的、保证胜利的政治觉悟。
    苏联军人是以个人对保卫祖国的责任的精神培育出来的，他们认识到，他们对希特勒德国作战，就是保卫他们的最宝贵的东西——祖国的自由与独立。这个崇高的目标鼓舞了战士们——苏联各族人民的儿子——的集体英雄主义。斯大林同志在他的命令中曾一再表扬所有兵种——步兵、炮兵、坦克手、飞行员、水兵——的官兵们的辉煌战绩和英雄主义。我们武装部队的一切兵种对于战胜敌人都有贡献。
    在战争期间，苏联军队在他们的光荣的指挥官的领导下获得了许多辉煌的胜利，这些胜利是我们的人民应当引以自豪的。这些胜利将永远活在人们心里。每一个胜利都是我们人民军事史上光荣的一页。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    德国法西斯军队在莫斯科的惨败，使得敌人包围并攻占我国首都的计划以及“闪电战”的计划落空了；在伟大的斯大林格勒战役中，结果包围、击败和俘掳了敌军三十三万人的精锐部队，这标志着第二次世界大战进程的根本转折点；希特勒匪军在高加索山麓的败北，使得敌人突破我军防线以窜犯我国产油地区、并把我们的主要的后备力量吸引到南方的计划无法得逞；库尔斯克之役结束了希特勒匪帮的攻势战略；一九四四年斯大林的十次沉重打击，确定了战争在我国国境外进行，并促成了希特勒集团的总崩溃；一九四五年在东普鲁士、维斯杜拉河和奥得河、布达佩斯和维也纳等辉煌战役中接连获得胜利；最后是攻克柏林——这些都是我军最光辉的胜利，它使得希特勒德国崩溃，终于无条件投降。我们同时也不应忘记我军击溃帝国主义日本的胜利战役。
    这些胜利都是普通战斗员和各级指挥员的英勇奋发建立殊勋以及后方工人英勇努力的结果。
    用自己的劳动和军事技术以及自己的血汗获致这样光辉的胜利，因而拯救了国家使之免于奴役的，正是苏联人民。（鼓掌）
    这些胜利都是苏联军事艺术的具体表现，苏联军官和将领的杰作，斯大林军事科学的胜利，我们的领袖和最高统帅斯大林同志的战略艺术的胜利。
    斯大林同志领导了苏联人民和武装部队反对外国侵略的斗争。正是在他的直接指导下，并依照他的天才计划，我们准备了并实现了伟大卫国战争中的历次具有决定意义的战役，击溃了希特勒德国和帝国主义日本。
    谈到战胜法西斯主义势力的胜利时，我们不能不提一提这个事实：除苏联军队以外，战时在苏联领土上组成的、光荣的波兰军队和捷克斯洛伐克军团对这个胜利也有贡献。（鼓掌）波兰和捷克斯洛伐克军队的战士们跟苏联军队并肩对共同敌人作战，在战斗中证明了他们的勇敢和军事技术。他们的胜利的作战在最高统帅斯大林当时的命令中屡次受到表扬。在战争的最后阶段，罗马尼亚和保加利亚军队参加了反对法西斯主义的武装斗争，也表现了优良的战斗品质。
    我国在战争中壮大和坚强了。帝国主义原希望苏联会被削弱，会被弄得精疲力竭，可是这个希望落空了。
    由于苏联的胜利，中欧和东南欧国家的人民就得到机会推翻地主资本家政权，在他们的国家建立人民民主制度。由于这些国家以及亚洲一些国家脱离了资本主义体系，现在三分之一的人类永远摆脱了帝国主义压迫。
    战争的结果告诉全世界：我们苏联是一个多么强大的力量。战后的年代再度表现了我国的力量。
    在解决战后的任务中，苏联人民又碰到了许多困难，因为战争对我们国家经济造成的破坏是非常巨大的。苏联的敌人又根据这种情况打他们的算盘，希望我们不能够用我们自己的力量克服面临的困难。但是苏联人民在他们的共产党的领导下同样出色地克服了这些重重的困难，不仅有足够的人力物力来医治战争创伤，而且大大地发展了工业、运输业、农业和文化，并大大地增进了劳动人民的物质福利。这些在第四个五年计划的期间达到了，这个计划的成果是大家都很熟悉的。
    第四个五年计划的胜利完成是我党的政策的又一次胜利。
    苏联在战时的历史性的胜利和在战后年代中的显著成就，使得我们的国家更加强固了，这种强固的程度是我们过去从来没有过的。
    可以毫不夸张地说：没有一个资产阶级国家有像苏联今天这样稳定的、不可动摇的国内局势，也从来不可能有过这样的国内局势。（掌声）
    今天，苏联是一个拥有第一等工业、充分发展的交通系统和高度农业生产的、巩固团结的社会主义国家。
    决定我们国家的经济生活的，是旨在增加社会财富、不断提高劳动人民的物质与文化水平、巩固独立与加强苏联防御能力的国家国民经济计划。
    这些任务的完成就是提交党代表大会讨论的关于苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示草案的目的。这项草案体现了社会主义制度的伟大力量，并反映了社会主义的基本经济法则，这个法则就是用在最高技术基础上不断发展和改进社会主义生产的方法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    这首先从指示草案的下列规定中得到证明：在五年内，工业生产量增加百分之七十左右，总的工业产量每年平均增加百分之十二左右，生产资料产量的增加占绝对优势。其结果，到一九五五年，工业产量将增为一九四○年的三倍。
    这也可以从这样的规定中得到证明：主要工业发展将极为迅速；五年内国民收入至少增加百分之六十，职工的实际工资至少增加百分之三十五，集体农民的收入至少增加百分之四十，贸易大大扩大，此外还有其他的指数。
    关于第五个五年计划的指示草案所规定的任务保证了先进技术、机器、工作母机和精确仪器的进一步有力的发展，而这又需要相应地增加具有高度水平的工程师、技师和工人干部。这对于进一步巩固我国经济和提高我国防御力量都有巨大的、积极的重要意义，因为现代化战争需要很多根据科学与技术的最新成就制造的武器。
    指示草案规定最重要的农产品的产量要增加百分之四十到七十，牲畜饲养业也要大大增加。这说明我国农业在今后几年内会有新的发展。
    对国家具有巨大重要性的是指示中所规定的教育方面的任务：大大扩大中等普及教育，在中等学校中开始推行多种技术教育。这些任务的完成将进一步提高我国人民的文化水平，并将提供大批新干部——受过良好教育的、具有技术知识的共产主义的建设者与祖国的保卫者。正如斯大林同志所说，要使社会成员都能够自由地选择职业而不致于终身束缚于一种什么职业，普及义务技术教育是必要的。
    关于第五个五年计划的指示草案，具体地体现了我们党的旨在加强各族人民之间的友谊和进一步提高各加盟共和国的经济与文化的列宁—斯大林民族政策，正像以前几个五年计划也都体现了这种政策一样。在这里发言的同志们提出了许多有力的事实和具有说服力的数字，说明苏联各加盟共和国的经济和文化都有迅速的发展，特别是在战后年代中。在这个新的五年计划期间，中亚细亚、外高加索、白俄罗斯、乌克兰和所有其他的共和国的国民经济都将获得进一步强大的发展。
    新的五年计划为立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的经济和文化各个部门的发展，规定了巨大任务。这些共和国的人民都是战前不久才加入兄弟般的苏维埃大家庭的，他们在那时以前一直生活在资产阶级政府的统治之下。
    在第四个五年计划期间，波罗的海沿岸的维苏埃共和国，虽然在战争中遭到严重创伤，仍然在发展它们的国民经济、特别是它们的工业中，取得了巨大的成就。关于第五个五年计划的指示，保证了这些共和国的国民经济的进一步发展。
    关于第五个五年计划的指示草案是苏联人民全力进行和平建设完全无意于战争的一个新的证明。说到这一点，我们也并不隐讳我们的经济能在最短期间转变成战时经济。
    在我们党的领导下，苏维埃人民正在从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义。
    斯大林同志的最新巨著“苏联社会主义经济问题”指出：为了准备这种过渡，必须可靠地保证整个社会生产的不断增长，首先是生产资料生产的发展，用逐渐过渡的办法，来把集体农场所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，并且也用逐渐过渡的办法，使产品交换来代替商品流通制，最后要达到可以保证社会的一切成员全面发展体力和脑力的社会文化的高涨。
    指示草案中规定的我国发展的方案，正是斯大林同志所指示的方向。第五个五年计划的指示中所规定的任务的完成，将保证我国人民在共产主义建设的一切方面获得新的胜利。
    新五年计划所规定的任务向党、苏维埃、经济组织、工会及共产主义青年团组织提出了重大的要求，责成它们动员广大的劳动人民群众来完成和超额完成新五年计划。斯大林同志说，“如果以为生产计划就是一张数字表和工作任务一览表，那就是愚蠢的想法了。其实，生产计划是千百万人的活的实际行动。使得我们的生产计划成为现实的，就是创造新生活的千百万劳动者。”
    在过去，苏维埃人民已经不止一次地表示了他们的不屈不挠的决心，不仅要完成，而且要超额完成国民经济计划，由于这样，这些计划提前完成了。我国人民的决心可由下面的事实来解释，就是他们认为经济计划反映了他们的切身利益，他们清楚地看到计划的完成将加强我们的苏维埃国家，增加我们的公共财富，改善苏联男女的生活，而每一年，每一个新五年计划都使我们的国家更接近于我们认定的目标——共产主义。（掌声）
    苏联人民完成并超额完成国民经济计划的决心，表现在全国范围的社会主义竞赛的发展上。没有疑问，在新五年计划的年代里，这种屡经试验的共产主义劳动方法也将是千百万苏联人民用来尽力提高劳动生产率，提前达到并超过所有生产目标使其达到高度水平的方法。
    多年社会主义建设的经验告诉我们：经济成就是直接和我们干部及全体党员的思想锻炼、马克思—列宁主义修养的水平以及广大劳动人民群众政治觉悟的水平成正比的。
    近年来，我们的党在思想工作的发展及其质量的提高方面，已做了许多工作。共产主义建设的任务要求进一步提高党的思想工作，进一步开展宣传工作和提高党员的理论水平。这是我们向前发展的最重要的前提之一。
    同志们！马林科夫同志向党代表大会所作的关于中央委员会工作的报告对国际局势作了深刻而全面的分析。目前国际局势最典型的特点之一是，由于帝国主义准备对苏联和各人民民主国家发动战争而使得国际局势更为恶化与紧张。
    美国利用战后所发生的这种局势，公然开始奉行一种以在全世界建立美国统治为目的的政策。
    近来美国垄断资本家一直在企图以“非共产主义世界通力合作和行动一致”等等漂亮辞句来掩饰他们的这种政策。但是尽管这些老爷们费尽心机，别人还是看得很清楚，他们的计划与意图跟当初也曾极力图谋世界霸权后来却碰得头破血流的希特勒及其随从们的计划和意图，并没有什么不同。图谋世界霸权的新的野心家，不妨记住这一点。
    近几年来，所有侵略国的地面部队和空军的人数已大大增加。例如，美国的武装部队的总数已增为一九三九年的六倍以上。英国的正规军已增为战前的两倍半。西德和日本在美国的要求下，已在建立武装部队，此外，他们还拼凑了一支所谓欧洲军，根据帝国主义的计划，这支军队在今年年底之前还要大大扩充。
    美国政府在大谈热爱和平的虚伪演说的掩饰下，正在国外——主要是在西德、法国、英国、法属摩洛哥、土耳其和日本等地，广泛组织和修建军事基地。同时美国主要在外国领土上，首先是在北大西洋集团的领海上建立海军基地。　不难看出，美国建立所有这些军事基地，是为了要用这些基地包围苏联，以便在一旦发生战争时为它自己制造有利条件。
    大西洋集团的将军们近来表现了很大的好战性，他们遵奉他们的华尔街主子的命令不断地在各国间匆忙奔走。
    他们在这里视察军队，在那里举行陆海空演习，在另外的地方又窥探苏联边境。单在最近三个月中，就有一打著名的美英军人到过苏土（土耳其）边界。
    这些穿着制服的豺狼在我们边界上的出现，自然不是偶然的事。这是帝国主义者准备反苏战争的活动中的一个环节。
    这也说明目前的土耳其政府完全丧失了对于土耳其人民命运的责任感，变成了美英集团的附属物，它正把土耳其拖上危险的赌博的道路。
    不久以前，大西洋集团在从挪威北部海岸到丹麦的波荷尔姆岛一带离苏联边境不远的地区，举行了联合海军演习。参加这次演习的有九个国家，其中除了挪威和丹麦外，没有一个国家在波罗的海地区有直接的利害关系。
    以美国现政府为首的帝国主义阵营的行动和意图显然是属于侵略和挑衅的性质的。
    当然我们不应低估了侵略阵营的力量，但是我们也不应过高估计了它们。这种力量本身包含着它们的母体、帝国主义体系的一切弱点。
    人们决不要看不见这种事实：资本主义阵营是由地位不平等的国家组成的，而且是被严重的内部矛盾弄得分裂了。这个阵营的头子们摇着反共的旗帜，硬说它们正在创造一个“自由国家的大家庭”。但是，严格说来，所谓自由国家的大家庭能够意味着什么东西呢？实在说，被拉进美国轴心的国家的人民并不想参加这个“大家庭”。实在说，他们对于为了美国垄断资本家的强盗利益而进行的新战争的前景是不感兴趣的。
    因此，资本主义国家的统治集团就用谎言的罗网来陷害人民，传播关于苏联和人民民主国家的谎言，叫嚣着需要把这些国家从共产主义下“解放”出来。在这一方面，美国统治集团的代表们表现得特别热心，他们竟然叫嚣着要用武装力量来“解放”欧洲和亚洲的一大部分，并且指明这些国家就是波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚、中国、蒙古人民共和国和其他国家。
    这种疯狂的计划甚至在资产阶级阵营中也引起了惊异。这个阵营中比较清醒的头子们问道：这些国家的人民愿意被“解放”么？
    这是一个有道理的问题。这些国家的人民的确并不需要这些“解放者”的帮忙。假如这些国家确实需要最后地摆脱什么人的话，那就是美国拚命派到那里去的间谍、破坏分子和恐怖分子。（掌声）此外，再不需要其它的“解放”了，尤其是因为全世界都知道“美国式的解放”究竟是什么意思。在过去这是在北美不人道地灭绝印第安族；残酷地屠杀菲律宾人民；武装干涉年轻的苏维埃共和国。目前“美国式的解放”就是在朝鲜的海盗式的掠夺战争，对朝鲜和平城市与乡村的野蛮轰炸以及以炸弹和恶毒的细菌屠杀妇女和儿童。
    美帝国主义者正以关于“解放”的谎话来掩盖他的掠夺行为。但是谎话救不了他们。谎话的腿是短的。用这种短腿是走不远的。（掌声）
    美国政府目前对于大西洋国家缺乏“政治上和精神上团结一致”的现象深感烦恼。显然是为了这个原因，它正在大事吹嘘美国给予这个集团各国的援助。但是大家都很明白美国“援助”究竟意味着什么。它意味着：美国公然掠夺这些国家并把它们置于美国统治之下。当美国政府给予它的附庸国家以“援助”时，它是遵守着资本主义世界的惯例的：“把对你没有用的东西给你的邻人”。他们就这样地来处置破烂的物品与陈旧的军备。他们正在利用对其他国家的军事和经济援助来逼迫这些国家积极地准备另一次战争。
    斯大林同志在叙述资本主义世界目前形势时说：“从外表上看来一切都好像是‘平安无事的’：美国使西欧、日本和其他资本主义国家不得不实行配给制；德国（西德）、英国、法国、意大利、日本都陷入了美国的铁爪中，顺从地执行着美国的吩咐。但是如果以为这种‘平安无事’会‘永世地’保存下去，这些国家将无止境地忍受美国的统治和压迫，它们不设法挣脱美国的奴役，而走上独立发展的道路，那就错了。”
    北大西洋集团伙计之间的矛盾和内部困难，阻止着他们的侵略计划的实现，而我们的强大的和平民主阵营使他们的计划更加无法实现。
    人民民主国家的劳动人民在他们的共产党和工人党的领导下在经济、政治和社会各方面都获得了显著的成就。这些成就生动地证明，民主阵营的国家现在比战前在旧的反人民政权下强大得多了。
    人民民主阵营国家之间已组织了经常的经济合作。这种合作是建筑在真诚希望互相帮助、达到普遍的经济发展的基础上的，这样，就保证了这些国家的工业的迅速发展。
    资本主义世界国家之间的关系，和社会主义世界国家之间的关系的区别就是这样。在那里，在资本主义国家，它们的关系是统治和从属的关系，其结果，在经济上软弱的国家就被毁灭和被奴役。而在我们这里，则是平等的关系，兄弟友好的关系，结果是导致普遍的经济发展。
    从易北河一直延伸到太平洋的和平民主阵营充满了和平建设的热情和维护持久和平的愿望。但是指出这一点是非常重要的：遇必要时，和平民主阵营是拥有完全现代化的充分强大的武装部队的。
    让资本家大人先生们了解并记在心上吧：一次新的世界大战对于资本主义比对民主阵营要危险。如果他们发动新的世界大战，他们将遭到一切爱好自由的人民的强有力的武装反击，爱好自由的人民将以全力永远消灭资本主义。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    因此，我们必须经常保持最高的警惕性，随时准备击退侵略者。历史经验告诉我们：帝国主义的地位愈削弱，它发动军事赌博的危险就愈大，帝国主义者也就愈加急切地企图消灭苏联来挽救他们的岌岌可危的境遇。
    因此，我们必须继续以各种方法来加强我们的陆军、空军和海军。我们的武装部队以及整个民主阵营的武装部队的经常军事准备，是预防一切意外事件的最可靠的保证。
    我们保持陆军和海军，来保卫我们的祖国，保障苏联人民的和平劳动。我们主张和平，我们奉行和平政策，奉行避免战争的政策。但是，苏联政府为了确保和平而提出的一切建议，都为美国政府以及它的那些应声虫所拒绝了。这些建议遭到拒绝，因为它们阻挠战争贩子的行动和侵略计划。结果，他们就向苏联发出恶毒的威胁和最荒谬的恫吓。
    我们的答复很简单：
    你们是白费气力了，帝国主义的大人先生们！伟大的苏联人民不是那么轻易害怕的，也不会被威胁吓倒。如果事情作得太过分了，我们的人民有力量起来进行自卫，保卫他们的祖国的利益。（暴风雨般的掌声）苏联的武装部队有力量依照苏联军事艺术的一切规则击退任何侵略者。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    同志们！正当我们的党代表大会开会的时候，伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念快到了。
    在十月革命的前夕，俄罗斯是在毁灭的边缘上：它面临着丧失民族独立而沦为外国帝国主义者的殖民地的危险。使得国家沦于这种境地的，是俄国的统治阶级——地主和资本家。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命在我们祖国的历史上开辟了一个新纪元。我们的党组织了工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟以后，终于在这次革命里推翻了资本家和地主，组织了无产阶级专政，废除了资本主义，消灭了人对人的剥削，保证了社会主义社会的建立。
    在党的领导下，我国人民完成了伟大的列宁关于变我们国家为富有的、强大的国家的训示。
    目前我们党的主要任务是通过从社会主义到共产主义的逐渐过渡，建立一个共产主义社会。在这条道路上的一个重要步骤是完成斯大林的第五个五年计划。
    我国人民的胜利是具有世界历史意义的。我们早已处于这样的一个阶段，在这个阶段中，全世界劳动人民都看到了我们所做的伟大工作的具体成果。由于社会主义建设的成就，我国已成为吸引着全体劳动人民和世界上所有进步人民的磁石。所有公正的人都认为我国是劳动人民在自己管理国家时和在我们这样一个党的领导下所可能取得的成就的榜样。
    我们党的力量在于指导它的先进理论，马克思—列宁主义的理论；我们党的力量在于它和人民的不可分的血肉联系，在于它鼓舞群众履行历史任务的能力；我们党的力量在于它的坚强的团结。
    我们党在举行第十九次代表大会时，是紧密地团结在列宁—斯大林的中央委员会的周围的，是紧密地团结在斯大林同志的周围的。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们党伟大的、不可战胜的旗帜万岁，列宁—斯大林的旗帜万岁！（经久不息的掌声）
    我们的领袖和导师、伟大的斯大林万岁！（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声。全体起立。大家欢呼：“伟大的斯大林，乌拉！”）
