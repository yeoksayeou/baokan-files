The Fighting Turkish Poet Nazım Hikmet
By our correspondent Bo Sheng

Warmly Caring for the Chinese People's Struggle

"If half of my heart is here, doctor,
Then the other half is in China with the army marching south across the Yellow River.
And then, every morning, doctor,
Every morning at dawn,
My heart is loading its gun in Greece."

This is the first stanza of the famous poem "Angina Pectoris" written in a Turkish prison by the outstanding Turkish revolutionary poet and International Peace Prize winner, Nazım Hikmet. From this short stanza, it is not difficult for us to see the poet's deep feelings for the fighting Chinese people. Recently, in order to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the poet finally realized his long-cherished wish and came to the capital of the People's China—Beijing.

The poet said: "The peace conference held in Beijing this time is of great significance. Here resonates the voice of 1.6 billion people. Judging from the breadth of the participating representatives alone, we can see that the world peace movement is expanding day by day. Today, the venue of the Beijing Peace Conference is like a large garden of peace and friendship, and such a large garden will appear before peace-loving and freedom-loving people all over the world. The great achievements of the conference will bring great contributions to the upcoming Vienna World People's Peace Congress."

The poet told us: "Although the Turkish reactionaries have tried every means to carry out slanderous propaganda against New China, the Turkish people deeply love New China. The Turkish people know that the Chinese people have realized their ideals and wishes, and they admire the happy life of the liberated Chinese people. We must learn from the Chinese people. The road of the victorious struggle of the Chinese people is like a book of profound wisdom for the Turkish people." He said that Beijing "is the heart of Asia, from which flows the fresh blood of youth, transporting it to the people of the entire Asia." The poet praised the power of the Chinese working people's peaceful construction "like a river, flowing into the great ocean." On October 1st, the poet participated in the great National Day celebrations. In front of Tiananmen, the poet proudly saw the invincible power of New China under the leadership of Mao Zedong. In the evening, the poet saw and heard the Chinese people's carnival singing and dancing on Tiananmen Square, from the window of his residence. That night, he thought a lot, he thought of the victory of the Chinese people today, and also of the scene of the Russian October Revolution in 1917, he thought of the great Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong..., he said to himself: "How good it is to be a Communist Party member!"

The Poet of Building Life

As a fighting poet, Nazım Hikmet is a heroic son of the Turkish people, an outstanding peace fighter, and also a talented revolutionary poet and political commentator. He dedicated his entire life to his motherland and the people. He has written many excellent and fighting works. In his own words:

I belong to those
Who use
Earth,
Fire,
Iron,
To build life, poets.

Nazım Hikmet was born in 1902 in the city of Salonika, Turkey. In his youth, he attended a naval school. Because he participated in revolutionary activities while interning on a warship, he was expelled from the fleet. At this time, he began to realize the irrationality of the Turkish social system. With great enthusiasm, he ran to Anatolia (Asia Minor), where he first came into contact with the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism. In 1921, when the poet was nineteen years old, he went to the Soviet Union after the great October Revolution. He excitedly recalled: "In the Soviet Union, my awareness of liberating the motherland was enhanced. I felt that I was one of the happiest people in the world because I had attended Comrade Stalin's class here. Here, I began to understand how to dedicate my love to the motherland—Turkey and the people of Turkey."

In Moscow, the poet met the great Soviet poet Mayakovsky. Mayakovsky's creation had a huge impact on the poet. While in Moscow, the poet wrote many poems and sent them back to his motherland. After they were published, they immediately attracted the attention of the Turkish reactionaries. This patriotic poet risked his life to return to his motherland and was immediately thrown into prison by the reactionaries. Initially, he was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Later, because his poetry collection was found on sailors of the Black Sea and students of the Naval Academy, the reactionary government further sentenced him to twenty-eight years and four months on the charge of "spreading communist ideas among Turkish army and navy soldiers." The poet spent seventeen years in prison. Although the long-term imprisonment caused the poet to suffer from rheumatism in his legs, the poet's heart and thoughts still fought in the ranks of the broad masses of the people. Although the poet was subjected to the threat of death in prison, he continued to work and wrote twelve volumes of poetry. These poems are full of the spirit of revolutionary optimism, full of deep love for the people and yearning for freedom. He said: "My struggle in prison is a very ordinary struggle. As an ordinary peace fighter and a glorious Communist Party member, it is my job to work for the peace and freedom of the people."

In March 1950, the poet was ill in prison and his life was in danger. His request to be released from prison for treatment was rejected by the reactionary government. The poet went on a hunger strike in prison for seventeen consecutive days, which aroused the anger of the Turkish people against the reactionary government and set off a movement to release Hikmet throughout the country, which was supported by peace-loving people all over the world. In this struggle, the Chinese people also sent out a voice of justice from the distant East. The Turkish reactionary government was frightened and panicked, and finally had to open the prison gate. The peace-loving people won, and the poet was free.

The Poet's Freedom is the Victory of the People's Struggle for Peace

"My release is also a victory for the Turkish people's struggle for peace." The poet said: "The Turkish people have heroically participated in the struggle to defend peace. They are living a painful life under the cruel persecution of the reactionary government and imperialism. Batches of peace-loving workers and farmers have been forced by the reactionary government to wear American military uniforms and sent to Korea to act as murderers. The Turkish people are not a war-loving people. They are kind people who love freedom and peace. Such a war must be stopped."

However, in Turkey, the struggle for peace is illegal. The famous Turkish short story writer and peace fighter Sabahattin Ali was murdered by the reactionary government. In order to suppress the people's peace movement, the Turkish reactionary government arrested and imprisoned 1,300 heroic peace fighters. The most famous Turkish peace fighter, Dr. Behidje Boran, chairman of the Turkish Peace Committee, has also been arrested and imprisoned by the Turkish reactionaries for more than two years. There are six other famous peace fighters in prison with him. However, even under such cruel suppression, the peace movement in Turkey is still developing day by day. Underground peace organizations have published many fighting magazines, posters, and leaflets. These have given the Turkish people great encouragement and strength. The people of all of Turkey are supporting the struggle for peace. Workers at the Iskenderun port have held several strikes, refusing to transport military supplies for US imperialism, and many farmers have actively supported the heroic struggle of the dockworkers. This year, when many wounded soldiers who had been sent by the reactionary government to Korea to participate in the war of aggression returned to the country, when the Turkish reactionary government wanted to replenish new soldiers, the families of the replenished soldiers rose up and struggled, preventing the soldiers from going to Korea.

Poetry Must Belong to the People

Talking about poetry, the poet Hikmet said: "If art cannot return to the people, then it is not useful art at all." Our poetry should be militant, it should reflect the ideological and life demands of the people; it should sing of struggle, sing of labor, sing of hope, sing of love... Poetry should have broad content, everything needed for practical life, and everything that actually exists, we must write. Progressive poetry plays a great role in the worldwide movement for peace, in the construction of socialist and communist societies, and in consolidating and strengthening the friendship of the people of the world." The poet said: "Although I am a Turkish poet, I have studied and researched the art of poetry in the Soviet Union, China, Korea, France, Britain, and other countries. In my works, I try my best to integrate nationality and internationalism."

Finally, Hikmet told us that he has written three plays in the past two years. The first play, "The Story of Turkey," is now being staged in theaters in Prague and Moscow, and the content is about the story of the Turkish people fighting for peace. The second play tells the story of a young couple in love in ancient Turkish folk tales, and is preparing to be staged at the Moscow Theater Academy. The third play writes about the struggle of the Turkish Communist Party and the Marshall Plan, and is also preparing to be staged in Moscow. At present, he is still writing a film script with the theme of the people of the world fighting for peace, which is half finished. In addition, he is still writing poetry. He excitedly told us that the Soviet Union is about to publish his fourth collection of poems written in Moscow, and New China is also preparing to publish his collection of poems. (Attached picture)

    战斗的土耳其诗人希克梅特
    本报记者　柏生
    热情地关怀着中国人民的斗争
    “假如我底心一半在这儿，医生，
    那么另外一半是在中国和南下黄河的军队在一起。
    然后，每天早晨，医生，
    每天早晨的黎明，
    我底心在希腊装进枪膛。”
    这是杰出的土耳其革命诗人、国际和平奖金获得者那瑞姆·希克梅特在土耳其狱中写的著名诗篇“心绞痛病”的第一节。从这短短的一节诗里，我们不难看出诗人对战斗的中国人民的深厚感情。最近为了出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，诗人终于实现了他多年的愿望，来到了人民中国的首都——北京。
    诗人说：“这次在北京召开的和平会议，意义是十分重大的，这里响着十六亿人民的呼声。仅从参加会议代表的广泛性，就可以看出世界和平运动已日益扩大。今天北京和平会议的会场，就像一座和平与友谊的大花园一样，这样的大花园，将出现在全世界各地爱好和平与自由的人民的面前。会议的巨大成就，将带给即将举行的维也纳世界人民和平大会很大的贡献。”
    诗人告诉我们：“虽然土耳其反动派想尽办法来对新中国进行诬蔑性的宣传，但土耳其人民却是深深地爱好新中国的。土耳其人民知道，中国人民已经实现了他们的理想和愿望，他们羡慕着解放了的中国人民的幸福生活。我们要向中国人民学习。中国人民胜利的斗争的道路，对土耳其人民就好像是一册渊博的智慧的书。”他说北京“是全亚洲的心脏，从这里流动着新鲜的青春的血液，输送给了全亚洲的人民。”诗人赞美着中国劳动人民的和平建设的力量“好像河一样，流到伟大的海洋”。十月一日，诗人参加了伟大的国庆典礼。在天安门前，诗人骄傲地看到了毛泽东领导下的新中国的不可战胜的力量。晚上，诗人在天安门的广场上，在他住处的楼窗里，兴奋地看到了和听到了中国人民的狂欢歌舞。那天晚上他想了许多，他想到今天中国人民的胜利，也想到一九一七年俄国十月革命的情景，他想到伟大的列宁、斯大林、毛泽东……，他对自己说：“做一个共产党员是多么好啊！”
    建设生活的诗人
    作为一个战斗诗人的希克梅特，是土耳其人民英勇的儿子、杰出的和平战士，也是一个天才的革命诗人、政论家。他以整个的生命献给了祖国和人民。他曾写了许多优秀的、战斗的作品。用他自己的诗来说：
    我就是属于那些
    用土，
    火，
    铁，
    建设生活的诗人。
    那瑞姆·希克梅特一九○二年诞生在土耳其的萨洛尼克城。他在少年时代，曾经进过海军学校，因为在舰上实习，参加了革命活动，便被舰队开除了。这时他开始认识了土耳其社会制度的不合理，怀着满腔的热情，跑到安那托里亚（小亚细亚）去，在那里他初次接触了马克思列宁主义的伟大学说。一九二一年，诗人十九岁的那一年，他到了伟大的十月革命后的苏联。他激动地回忆道：“在苏联，我的解放祖国的觉悟性提高了。我感到我是世界最幸福人中的一个，因为我曾经在这里听过斯大林同志的课。在这里，我开始懂得如何把我的爱献给祖国——土耳其和土耳其的人民。”
    在莫斯科，诗人认识了苏联伟大的诗人马雅可夫斯基。马雅可夫斯基的创作曾给诗人以巨大的影响。诗人在莫斯科时，曾写了许多诗寄回祖国，发表后，立刻引起了土耳其反动派的注意。这位爱国诗人冒着危险回到祖国以后，立刻被反动派投入监狱。最初他被判了十五年徒刑。以后因为在黑海水手和海军军官学校学生的身上搜查出他的诗集，反动政府就以“在土耳其陆海军士兵中传播共产主义思想”的罪名，又加判他二十八年零四个月的徒刑。诗人先后在狱中度过了十七年。长期的监禁，虽然使诗人的双腿患了风湿症，但诗人的心和思想，却仍旧战斗在广大的人民的行列中。诗人在监禁中虽然经受着死的威胁，但仍旧不断地工作，写出了十二卷诗。这些诗篇里充满了革命的乐观主义精神，充满了对人民的挚爱和对自由的渴望。他说：“我在狱中的斗争，是一个很平凡的斗争，作为一个普通的和平战士、一个光荣的共产党员来说，为了人民的和平与自由，那是我应该作的工作。”
    一九五○年三月，诗人病在狱中，生命垂危，要求出狱治病，竟遭到反动政府的拒绝。诗人在狱中连续绝食了十七天，这引起了全土耳其人民对反动政府的愤怒，在全国掀起了释放希克梅特的运动，并且得到了全世界爱好和平的人民的声援。在这个斗争中，中国人民也从遥远的东方发出了正义的呼吁。土耳其反动政府吓得慌乱了，最后不得不打开监狱的大门。爱好和平的人民胜利了，诗人自由了。
    诗人的自由就是人民为和平而斗争的胜利
    “我的释放，也正是土耳其人民为和平而斗争的一个胜利。”诗人说：“土耳其人民，英勇地参加了保卫和平的斗争。他们在反动政府和帝国主义残酷的迫害下过着痛苦的日子。成批爱好和平的工人、农民兄弟，被反动政府强迫穿上了美国的军装，送到朝鲜去充当杀人的凶犯。土耳其人民不是好战的人民，他们是爱好自由与和平的善良人民，这样的战争一定要制止。”
    然而在土耳其，为和平的斗争是犯法的。著名的土耳其短篇小说作家、和平战士萨巴哈丁·艾里就是被反动政府杀害的。土耳其反动政府为了镇压人民的和平运动，曾经把一千三百名英勇的和平战士逮捕监禁起来。最著名的土耳其和平战士柏希基·鲍伦（Behidje　Boran）博士、土耳其和平委员会的主席，也被土耳其反动派逮捕入狱两年多了。现在和他在一起坐牢的还有六个著名的和平战士。但是，就是在这样的残酷的镇压下，土耳其的和平运动仍是在一天一天发展着的。地下的和平组织出版了许多战斗的杂志、招贴画、传单。这些都给了土耳其人民以极大的鼓舞和力量。全土耳其的人民都在支持着和平的斗争。伊斯根特伦港口工人曾举行了好几次的罢工，拒绝为美帝国主义搬运军火，许多农民，也积极地支持了码头工人的英勇斗争。当今年许多被反动政府派去朝鲜参加侵略战争的受伤士兵回国后，土耳其反动政府要补上新的士兵时，被补送去的士兵们的家属起来进行了斗争，阻止了士兵开到朝鲜去。
    诗必须属于人民
    谈到诗，诗人希克梅特说：“艺术如果不能回到人民中去，那就根本不是有用的艺术。”我们的诗应当富有战斗性，它应该反映人民思想上和生活上的要求；它应当歌唱斗争，歌唱劳动，歌唱希望，歌唱爱情……。诗应当有广泛的内容，一切为实际生活所需要的，和实际上存在的东西，我们都要写。进步的诗，在全世界为和平而斗争的运动中，在社会主义、共产主义社会的建设中，在巩固和加强全世界人民的友谊上，是起了很大的作用的。”诗人说：“我虽然是一个土耳其诗人，但我却学习和研究了苏联、中国、朝鲜、法国、英国等国诗的艺术。在我的作品中，我尽量地做到民族性和国际主义相融合。”
    最后，希克梅特告诉我们，近两年来他已经写好了三个剧本。第一个剧本——“土耳其的故事”，现在已经在布拉格和莫斯科的剧院上演，内容是写为和平而斗争的土耳其人民的故事。第二个剧本写土耳其古代民间一对青年男女恋爱的故事，准备在莫斯科戏剧学院上演。第三个剧本写土耳其共产党的斗争和马歇尔计划，也准备在莫斯科上演。目前他还在写着一个电影剧本，以全世界人民为和平而斗争为主题，已经写了一半。此外他还在写诗。他兴奋地告诉我们，最近苏联正要出版他在莫斯科写的第四本诗集，新中国也在准备出版他的诗集。（附图片）
