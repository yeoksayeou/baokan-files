Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th: The chief liaison officer of the US delegation to the Korean Armistice Negotiations had to admit on October 7th that US military aircraft violated the agreement by intruding into the Panmunjom conference area airspace on October 3rd. He expressed regret for this and claimed that he would do his best to avoid the recurrence of such incidents. However, the US side continued to delay regarding the violation of the agreement regarding the intrusion of aircraft into the conference area airspace on September 17th, claiming that it was still under investigation. Our chief liaison officer sternly pointed out that the US violation of the agreement on the 17th had already been jointly investigated and irrefutably verified by the security officers of both sides. The US side must strictly restrain its military personnel to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th: At the liaison officers' meeting on October 7th, the US liaison officer admitted that US aircraft had violated the agreement on October 3rd by intruding into the Panmunjom conference area airspace. However, they still tried to evade responsibility for the incident of US aircraft flying over the conference area on September 17th. Regarding this incident, even US military police Private First Class Robert admitted to seeing US aircraft intrude into the conference area airspace. The incident occurred twenty days ago, but the US side still stubbornly claimed to be "still investigating."

While admitting the incident of October 3rd, the US side routinely expressed "regret" and stated that it would "continue to make efforts to prevent such overflight incidents." However, since August, the US side has continuously created eleven incidents violating the conference area agreement. On August 2nd and September 28th, the US side shelled the conference area. On August 4th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 16th, September 17th, and October 3rd, US aircraft intruded into the conference area airspace seven times. On September 14th, the US side dropped slanderous leaflets in the conference area. On September 29th, two US conference area military police officers and a driver trespassed beyond the conference area without authorization and intruded into our area. Moreover, the US side is increasingly blatantly using the conference area as a channel for dispatching secret agents. Facts have proven that the so-called "regret" and "efforts" repeatedly stated by the US side are completely hypocritical.

    美方承认十月三日美机侵入会场区事件
    八月份以来美方违反协议事件已达十一次
    【新华社开城七日电】朝鲜停战谈判美方代表团首席联络官在十月七日不得不承认十月三日美方军用飞机违反协议侵入板门店会场区上空，对此表示遗憾，并称将尽力避免这种事件的再行发生。但同时美方对九月十七日飞机侵入会场区上空的违反协议的事件，继续采取了拖延的态度，声称仍在继续调查中。我方首席联络官严正指出，十七日美方违反协议的事件已经由双方安全军官共同调查，并无可争辩地予以证实。美方必须严格约束其军事人员，使类似事件不再发生。
    【新华社开城七日电】在十月七日双方联络官会议上，美方联络官承认十月三日美机曾违反协议，侵入板门店会场区上空。但是对九月十七日美机飞越会场区事件，仍图推卸责任。关于这一事件，连美方军事警察一等兵罗勃也曾承认看见美机侵入会场区上空。事件发生已过二十天之久，而美方却仍强称“尚在调查”。
    美方在承认十月三日的事件时，照例地表示“遗憾”，声言“继续努力以防止此种飞越事件”。但自八月以来，美方已连续制造了十一次违反会场区协议的事件。八月二日、九月二十八日、美方炮击会场区。八月四日、十日、十一日、十二日、十六日、九月十七日、十月三日，美机七次侵入会场区上空。九月十四日，美方在会场区内投发诬蔑性传单。九月二十九日，美方会场区军事警察二人及司机一人擅自越出会场区，侵入我方地区。而且，美方愈来愈明目张胆地把会场区用为派遣特务的来往通道。事实证明美方多次申言的所谓“遗憾”及“努力”是完全虚伪的。
