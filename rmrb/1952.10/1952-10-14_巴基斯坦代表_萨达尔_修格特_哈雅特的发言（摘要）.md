As a veteran who has unfortunately participated in a foreign war and a civil war, I would like to say a few words to you. A person like me is naturally very familiar with all the horrors, hunger, and pain of war. I have personally witnessed the suffering of helpless women and homeless men; I have personally heard the cries of young widows, elderly parents, and fatherless orphans; I have even witnessed innocent babies suckling on the corpses of their murdered mothers, and mothers holding their headless babies, their souls lost. In a word, all the ugliness and horror I have seen has made me hate war and love peace; I have had to transform myself from a soldier engaged in war into a fighter for peace.

Peace, the peace that I love so much and consider so precious, has today become a victim in the hands of a group of greedy thugs – in Korea and Malaya, in Taiwan and Vietnam, in Burma and Tunisia, she is being brutally ravaged everywhere by that gang of robbers. Enough has been done in the name of democracy and civilization, enough to make the brutality of the most vicious dictators pale in comparison. In terms of abuse, rumour-mongering, hypocrisy, and lying, these propagandists, who used to think of themselves as defenders of democracy and justice, have effortlessly surpassed Goebbels – yes, compared to them, Goebbels is practically a saint. All peace-loving people! Beware of the despicable and cunning schemes of the imperialist warmongers, and do not be deceived by their smokescreen of democracy and justice. Let us resolve from now on to mobilize our people all over the world to fight against war, and let us fight on until this disaster is finally eliminated from the earth.

Let us turn our attention to the greatest threat to peace, which is the unprovoked invasion of Korea's independence by the United States and its lackeys. Today, in that war-torn country, every minute, hundreds and thousands of sisters are becoming widows, children are becoming orphans, and men are becoming cripples and blind. Today, the terror of war, which has been completely exposed, envelops that land. There, you will find how Western democracy and hypocrisy have become synonymous, and there, you will hear people call those who defend their homeland invaders, while calling foreign mercenary troops saviors of freedom. Do I need to remind you how Syngman Rhee and his masters prepared for this invasion, how they collected weapons and trained troops, and how civil liberties were trampled upon? Is it necessary to expose the absurd story of the United States saying that North Korea launched the invasion? Honest people, no one can fail to see that these events are exactly the same as what happened in Nazi Germany in 1939. The only difference is, perhaps, that these victors of the war against Germany have even improved on the defeated party's shameful techniques. Hitler must be very pleased with his new successors!

Like a guilty child, these warmongers are shouting from the rooftops that they are acting on the legitimate orders of the United Nations organization. They want the people of the world to close their eyes and not see the fact that the American warlords ordered the looting of Korea several hours before the Security Council's yes-men, trailing behind the United States, issued a proclamation. This clearly proves that the United Nations organization is nothing more than a powerless tool and a follower of the will of the United States. If the United Nations is a true guardian of peace, why has it taken no action in Greece, Indonesia, Tunisia, and other countries where the weak are oppressed by the strong? As for whether this order is legal, I ask, how can it be considered legal to pass such an important resolution in a council attended by the Quisling of Taiwan instead of the representative of the people's China, a great nation? Secondly, how can it be considered legal to take such a serious step in the absence of the Soviet representative? Thirdly, how can any God-fearing person legally or otherwise endorse the Security Council's death sentence on Korea in its own absence? Here, millions of Korean men, women, and children are sentenced to death without trial, based solely on this court's absurd indictment, and this court is acting as prosecutor, judge, and jury all in one. This violation of legal rights, this massacre of millions of Korean people, will become a most despicable crime in the annals of legal history and will stink for eternity. This clearly proves who is the criminal, who is the plaintiff, and who is the defendant. All the great jurists of history would be restless in their graves when they saw this farcical trial and the collective conviction of an entire nation that it has caused.

Regarding the issue of mistreatment of prisoners of war, there is no excuse in the world to justify the massacre of helpless prisoners of war on Geoje Island. Only a coward and a villain would kill unarmed prisoners of war. Have the Americans forgotten that when the Germans had just put handcuffs on British prisoners of war, Mr. Churchill, the American ally, shouted loudly? Let me tell them, no brutality can suppress the spirit of a crusader for peace. They have used all kinds of espionage methods, and the result is only a high wall of angry public opinion around the world, and the whole world will rise up to demand revenge. Today, the general demand is: "Do not violate prisoners of war." The so-called flag bearers of civilization have launched an inhuman germ warfare, which is bound to shame all peace-loving Americans and Britons, just as it has outraged all peace-loving people around the world. Spreading germs to humanity is not something that humans do, it is something that devils do. We emphatically demand an immediate end to this barbaric behavior, and we demand that all governments immediately ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol, and we firmly advocate the establishment of an impartial international tribunal to try all criminals who have participated in this criminal act to a greater or lesser extent.

Speaking of the attitude of the Pakistani people towards the Korean issue, Pakistan's peace-loving friends have solemnly resolved: We must continue to work hard to prevent a Pakistani soldier from wearing American boots to tarnish the sacred land of Korea. If they must do so, they must first step over the corpses of their Pakistani mothers, sisters, and sons. We guarantee that we will never give up until the last foreign soldier has withdrawn from Korea and Malaya, from Taiwan and Vietnam, from Tunisia and Egypt.

We pay tribute to those brave people who hold high the torch of freedom, peace, and justice, and we pay tribute to those fearless warriors who are fighting for freedom in Korea. Let them know that we deeply feel how grateful we should be to them. We understand very well how bravely they are sacrificing themselves to suppress the bloody desire of the American war demon, so that our children can enjoy the fruits of peace that their children have been cruelly deprived of. Let them take hope from the fact that in a distant land, there are many mothers whose maternal hearts are praying for them, regarding them not only as the saviors of Korea, but as the saviors of all mankind. These voices will become more and more powerful, and will engulf the vultures hovering over the corpses of Koreans, and that day is not far away. They are by no means isolated; all peace-loving people in Europe, Asia, and the Americas are allies in their peace crusade.

Finally, I believe that a speech on peace cannot be considered complete without paying tribute to the beacon of peace on the Asian continent shrouded in the fog of war – our great master, the Chinese people. We had already heard a lot about their peace when we were still in our own country, and read many great stories about their heroic march towards freedom, but what we see here today far exceeds our highest imagination. We now fully realize that the great march towards progress is unstoppable, and it is impossible to deprive Asia of its freedom as long as there are such defenders as they are. Here, let me sincerely pay tribute to their great leader, statesman, and mentor, Chairman Mao Zedong, who inspires and supports millions of standard-bearers of peace, progress, and all good things. Mao Zedong is now not only the leader of free China, but to us, he is the father of the revival of Asia, he is a symbol of hope, and he inspires millions of desperate hearts around the world.

We sincerely hope that the Pakistani crescent and star flag and India's friendly tricolor flag will soon advance side by side with China's five-star red flag in the great march towards freedom, progress, and peace.

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!
Long live the heroes of Korea!
Long live peace! (Xinhua News Agency)

### 巴基斯坦代表  萨达尔·修格特·哈雅特的发言（摘要）

    巴基斯坦代表
    萨达尔·修格特·哈雅特的发言（摘要）
    我以一个曾经很不幸地参加过一次国外战争和一次国内战争的退伍军人的身份，来向你们说几句话。我这样一个人，对于战争中的一切恐怖、饥寒和痛苦自然是很熟悉的。我曾经亲眼看到无助的妇女和无家可归的男人们所遭受到的苦难；亲耳听到过年轻的寡妇、年老的父母和无父的孤儿们的哭声；我更亲眼看见过在已被杀死的母亲的尸体上吃奶的无辜的婴儿，和紧抱着无头的婴儿的失了魂魄的母亲。一句话，我所看到的一切丑恶和恐怖已使我不能不痛恨战争，热爱和平；不得不把自己从一个从事战争的士兵转变成为一个争取和平的战士。
    和平，我所如此热爱并认为非常珍贵的和平，今天已经成为一群贪婪的暴徒手中的受难者了——在朝鲜和马来亚，在台湾和越南，在缅甸和突尼斯，她正到处遭到那一群强盗的残暴的蹂躏。假借着民主和文明的名义所干的那些勾当实在够多了，已经够使最恶毒的独裁者们的残暴行为都变得黯然失色了。在辱骂、造谣、虚伪、说谎等方面，这些从前自以为是民主与正义的维护者的宣传家们真是毫不费力地一下就远远超过了戈培尔——是的，同他们比起来，戈培尔倒简直像个圣人了。一切酷爱和平的人们！谨防帝国主义战争贩子们的卑鄙狡猾的阴谋吧，不要被他们的民主和正义的烟幕欺骗了。让我们从此下定决心动员我们全世界的人民为了反对战争而斗争吧，让我们不停地斗争下去，直到这个灾祸最后在地球上全部消灭为止。
    让我们把注意力转到和平所受到的最大的威胁，那就是美国及其走狗们无缘无故地侵犯了朝鲜的独立。今天，在那个满身都是战争创伤的国度里，每一分钟都有千百个姐妹们变成了寡妇，孩子们变成了孤儿，男人们变成了残废和瞎子。今天，笼罩着那个国土的是已经暴露无遗的战争恐怖。在那里，你会发现西方民主和伪善如何变成了同义字，在那里，你会听到人们把保卫自己家乡的人叫做侵略者，而把外国雇佣军队称为自由的救星。难道还需要我来提醒你们，李承晚和他的主子们是怎样准备了这一次的侵略、他们怎样收集武器与训练军队、公民自由权是怎样遭受到践踏吗？难道还用得着揭露美国说北朝鲜发动侵略这话是荒唐的故事吗？正直的人们，没有谁会看不清楚，这些事件与一九三九年在纳粹德国所发生的事是同出一辙的。二者唯一的区别，也许就是这些对德作战的胜利者甚至更加改进了那个战败者的可耻的技术。希特勒对于他新的继承人，一定很满意！
    正像一个做贼心虚的小孩一样，这些战争贩子们在屋顶上高喊着，他们是奉行着联合国的组织的合法命令的。他们想让全世界人民都闭起眼睛，不要去看这个事实：那就是美国军阀们下命令劫掠朝鲜，比跟在美国屁股后面走的安全理事会中那些唯唯诺诺的奴才们发表公告早好些个钟头。这就清清楚楚地证明了，联合国组织不过是一个无权的工具和听从美国意志的跟班而已。如果联合国是和平的真正维护者，试问它为什么在希腊、印度尼西亚、突尼斯及其他弱者被强者压迫的国家里没有采取任何行动？至于这个命令是否合法，我请问，在一个由台湾的吉斯林分子而不是由人民的中国代表这个大国家出席的理事会中通过如此重要的决议，怎能算是合法？其次，在苏联代表缺席之下，采取这样一个严重步骤，怎能算是合法？第三，任何一个信奉上帝的人怎能从法理或其他方面来认可安全理事会在朝鲜本身缺席之下，对它所判处的死刑呢？这里，千百万朝鲜男女与儿童，不经审判，仅仅依据这个法庭的一纸荒谬起诉书就被判处死刑，而这个法庭又是集检查官、法官与陪审官三者的职务于一身的。这种对法权的侵犯，这种对千百万朝鲜人民的屠杀，将成为法律史册上一个最卑鄙的罪恶而遗臭万年。这清楚地证明了谁是罪犯，谁是原告，谁是被告。历史上的一切大法学家都会在地下辗转不安，当他们看到了这场滑稽的审判及其所引起的对于整个民族的集体判罪的时候。
    关于虐待战俘问题，世界上找不出任何一个藉口可以替这种屠杀巨济岛上无助的战俘们的行为辩护。只有一个懦夫和恶汉才会向手无寸铁的战俘们动手屠杀。难道美国人已经忘记了当德国人才刚刚给英国战俘们扣上了手铐的时候，美国的盟友邱吉尔先生就高声地吵叫起来吗？让我告诉他们吧，任何兽行都压抑不住一个和平十字军的精神。他们用了种种特务的手段，其结果只是在整个世界上造成了一道愤怒的舆论的高墙，而整个世界也将起来要求报仇。今天普遍的要求是：“不准侵犯战俘。”所谓的文明的旗手竟发动了惨无人道的细菌战争，这件事必定会使一切爱好和平的美国人和英国人感到耻辱，正如它已经使全世界爱好和平的人们震怒了一样。对人类散布病菌不是人做的事，是魔鬼做的事。我们着重地要求立刻终止这种野蛮行为，并且要求各国政府立刻批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书，我们坚决主张成立一个公正的国际法庭，审判一切或多或少参与过这次罪恶行为的罪犯。
    谈到巴基斯坦人民对朝鲜问题的态度，巴基斯坦的和平朋友们已经庄严地下了决心：我们一定要不断努力，不使一个巴基斯坦兵士穿上美国的军靴来玷污朝鲜神圣的土地。假如他们一定要这样做，他们就先得踩过他们巴基斯坦母亲、姊妹和儿子们的尸体。我们保证：只要还有一个外国士兵没有从朝鲜和马来亚撤退，从台湾和越南撤退，从突尼斯和埃及撤退，我们决不罢休。
    我们向那些高举着自由、和平和正义的火炬的勇敢的人民致敬，向那些在朝鲜争取自由的无畏战士致敬。让他们知道：我们深深地感觉到我们应该如何感谢他们。我们很明白他们是多么勇敢地牺牲自己去压制美国战魔血腥的欲望，为的是使我们的孩子们能够享受到他们的孩子们被残酷地剥夺的和平果实。让他们从下面的事实中得到希望：那就是在一个遥远的国土，有很多母亲，她们的慈母之心正在为他们祈祷，把他们看作不单是朝鲜的救主，而且是全人类的救主。这些呼声将越来越有力，并且把那些在朝鲜人尸体上盘旋的兀鹰一起吞没，这个日子不远了。他们决不是孤立的；欧洲、亚洲和美洲的一切爱好和平的人民都是他们和平十字军里的同盟者。
    最后，我认为一篇有关和平的演说如果没有向处在战争迷雾中的亚洲大陆上的和平的灯塔——我们的强大的主人中国人民致敬的话，那篇演说是不能算一篇完整的演说的。我们还在本国的时候就已经听到很多关于他们的和平的消息，读到很多关于他们英勇地向自由前进的伟大的故事，但是，我们今天在这儿看到的一切，真是远远超过了我们的最高的想像。我们现在完全认识到走向进步的大进军是无法阻挡的，只要有着像他们这样的保卫者，要想剥夺亚洲的自由是决不可能的。这里让我诚心诚意地向他们的伟大领袖、政治家和导师毛泽东主席致敬，他鼓舞着和支持着千百万维护和平、进步和一切美好事物的旗手。毛泽东现在已不只是自由中国的领袖了，对我们讲来，他是亚洲复兴之父，他是希望的象征，他鼓舞着全世界千百万颗绝望的心。
    我们恳挚地希望，巴基斯坦的星月旗和印度友好的三色旗一起，将在不久的将来和中国的五星红旗在走向自由、进步与和平的大进军中并肩前进。
    毛泽东主席万岁！
    朝鲜的英雄们万岁！
    和平万岁！（新华社）
