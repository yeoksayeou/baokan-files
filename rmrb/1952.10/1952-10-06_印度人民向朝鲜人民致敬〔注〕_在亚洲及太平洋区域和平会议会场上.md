The Indian People Pay Tribute to the Korean People [Note]
——At the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference Venue
	She trails a long skirt as white as snow.
	She is draped in clothing dyed yellow by tropical sunshine.
A Korean woman, an Indian woman,
	both walk face to face near that flying dove,
	The hall resounds with applause like a rainstorm.
	She steps over the land burned by gasoline.
	She crosses the fence built by prejudice and lies.
The heroic people accept a gift from an ancient nation –
	A bright lamp in a cluster of fragrant flowers – "Jyothi."
Without words, all this tells you:
	"The flame is my soul, the fragrant flowers show its purity.
	My heroic sister, may your glory be as everlasting as this 'Jyothi'!
	My heroic sister, no violence can destroy you!"
She is at the northern end of Asia, she is at the extreme south of Asia,
	separated by high mountains, vast oceans, and layers of obstacles,
	but the hearts of two mothers are always the same!
They embrace like sisters, intimately close,
	everyone in the hall sheds tears of mingled sorrow and joy like them.
You wipe away the blood stains from her body,
	she soothes your ancient wounds,
	hot tears mingle in each other's bosoms.
Without words, the wish of every woman, every ordinary person
	is the same;
Without words, this embrace symbolizes a peaceful Orient.

[Note] On the second day of the peace conference, the Indian delegation presented a gift to the Korean delegation. One of the items was the "Jyothi" lamp, the meaning of which is as described in the poem. (Attached picture)

    印度人民向朝鲜人民致敬〔注〕
    ——在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议会场上
    袁水拍她曳着白雪般皎洁的长裙。她披着被热带阳光染黄的衣裳。一个朝鲜女人，一个印度女人，双双迎面走到那飞翔的鸽子近旁，会场里响起了暴雨似的鼓掌。她踏过那汽油燃烧的土地。她跨过了偏见和谎话所筑起的藩篱。英勇的人民接受一个古老民族的献礼——
  一盏香花丛中的明灯——“觉谛”。不用语言，这一切就告诉了你：
  “火焰是我的灵魂，香花表明它的纯洁。我的英勇的姊妹啊，愿你的光荣跟这‘觉谛’一样永远不灭！我的英勇的姊妹啊，任何暴力都不能摧毁你！”她在亚洲的北端，她在亚洲的极南，中间隔着高山大洋和重重障碍，但两颗母亲的心总是一般！她们像姊妹一般相抱，亲切地依偎，全场的人跟她们一样流下了悲喜交集的眼泪。你擦去她身上的血迹，她抚慰你古老的创伤，热泪交流彼此的胸膛。不用语言，每一个妇女、每一个普通人的心愿
  都是一样；不用语言，这拥抱象征了和平的东方。
    〔注〕和平会议第二天，印度代表团向朝鲜代表团献　礼，礼品中有一项是“觉谛”（Jyothi）灯，　它的含意如诗中所述。（附图片）
