All-China Federation of Trade Unions Holds a Get-Together with Workers' Representatives from Various Countries
    To celebrate the successful conclusion of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held a get-together on the evening of the 15th with workers' representatives and trade union workers from various countries attending the Peace Conference. The get-together was filled with an atmosphere of working-class solidarity. The guests and hosts frequently raised their glasses to the great achievements of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, to the victory of the Chinese working class, and to the unity of the working classes of all countries in the struggle for world peace. At the meeting, fifteen workers' representatives from various Latin American countries attending the Peace Conference presented the All-China Federation of Trade Unions with a personally signed letter of respect. Prior to the get-together, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held a discussion with workers' representatives and trade union workers from various countries, during which Lai Ruoyu, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, introduced the situation of the Chinese workers' movement.

National Women's Federation Holds Symposium on Women's Issues
    The All-China Democratic Women's Federation held a symposium on women's issues on the afternoon of the 15th with women representatives from various countries participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Honorary Chairpersons of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Soong Ching Ling and He Xiangning, also attended the meeting. After Li Dequan, Vice-Chairperson of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, delivered a welcoming speech, Vice-Chairperson Deng Yingchao introduced the great role played by Chinese women in realizing equal rights with men in all aspects and in national construction. Madame Santi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, then spoke, saying: "To protect children, our task should be to unite all men and women who care about children's welfare and women's rights to ensure children's right to live and be educated in a peaceful world." Maria Antonieta de Silva, a female representative from Ecuador, expressed gratitude on behalf of Latin American women to Chinese women and all the people for their warm reception. Geng Lishu, a representative from the United States, said: "The female representatives of the American delegation were inspired by the meeting. We used to think we were free, but at the meeting, we heard about the situation of women in the Soviet Union and China and realized that American women still need to work hard to fight for freedom. After talking with women from Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, we have a clearer understanding of the truth that the American government is preparing for war and carrying out germ warfare." Mrs. Felton from the United Kingdom said that her three months' stay in New China was the most exciting time of her life. She bid farewell to her Chinese sisters with reluctance and expressed her gratitude to Chinese women and the Chinese people for their kindness to her and their contributions to world peace. Kim Young-soo, a representative from Korea, said in her speech: "The Korea we are returning to is different from the China we are in now. What awaits us is the bombing of bombs and damp caves. But we Korean women will persevere in our struggle to realize the hopes you place in us." Nielsen from Canada, Carmen Moran from Guatemala, Chalermporn Ganrayanamit from Thailand, and Nguyen Thi Than from Vietnam also spoke at the meeting. They all warmly thanked the Chinese women for their warm reception and wished the Chinese women new achievements in peaceful construction. Subsequently, female representatives from Guatemala, Ecuador, Thailand, Myanmar and other countries presented gifts to Chinese women; Nina Fiahnhouse of Israel presented gifts to Korean women on behalf of Arab and Jewish women. Chinese women gave gifts to all the female representatives of various countries, including a painting of a tiger by He Xiangning. Finally, a get-together was held.

Democratic Youth Federation Holds Symposium on Youth Issues
    The All-China Democratic Youth Federation and youth and student representatives from various countries attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held a symposium on youth issues at 3:00 p.m. on the 19th. More than 40 youth and student representatives from more than 20 countries in Asia, Australia, and the Pacific coast of the Americas, as well as worker leaders, farmer leaders, women leaders, and famous peace fighters attended the meeting.
    Liao Chengzhi first addressed the meeting, expressing a warm welcome to the representatives of various countries. Li Chang introduced to the representatives the situation of Chinese youth and student organizations and the free and happy lives of young people in New China. Echevarria, Vice-President of the International Student Union, addressed the meeting, calling on youth and student representatives from various countries to widely publicize the resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and mobilize students from various countries to fight for peace. The youth and student representatives from various countries who spoke at the meeting introduced the situation of their countries' youth and students' struggle for peace. They expressed their warm gratitude to the Chinese people and Chinese youth for their great contribution to the Peace Conference and hoped to strengthen the friendly unity of youth from various countries in Asia and the Pacific in the struggle for peace.
    Hu Yaobang finally addressed the representatives, saying: "Chinese youth resolutely support the resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and are willing to unite with youth from various countries to fight for the realization of the resolutions."

Great Unity of Literary and Art Circles Fighting for Peace
    Fifty-five literary and art workers from the delegations of fifteen countries participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held a discussion with Chinese literary and art workers on the 19th. Mao Dun, on behalf of Chinese literary and art workers, paid tribute to the distinguished guests who came to defend peace. He said that the intensive work of the eleven-day conference had yielded great results. This is work for the peace and happiness of 1.6 billion people and for the happiness of millions of children in the future. Chinese literary and art workers unconditionally support the eleven documents passed by the Peace Conference and will use literary and artistic forms to publicize the spirit of the resolutions. Our common language is peace and the pursuit of progress. Today is a historically significant beginning. In the future, we must intensify our contact, exchange experiences in various ways, learn from each other, and work hard for our common cause. Subsequently, literary and art workers from various countries held discussions in seven groups: literature, poetry, music, fine arts, drama, film, and dance. Chinese literary and art workers respectively introduced the development of various departments of Chinese literature and art at the meeting, and narrated the work and achievements of literary and art workers in New China in building the motherland and defending peace. The representatives were very interested in the actual situation of the Chinese literary and art circles and raised many questions, which were answered by Chinese literary and art workers respectively. Representatives from various countries talked about the recent creations of progressive writers and artists in their countries and their participation in the struggle to defend peace. They also extensively discussed the issue of strengthening cultural exchanges among the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions.
    After the group discussions, everyone returned to the hall. Mexican writer Ernesto √Ålvarez Nolasco read letters from some progressive Mexican writers to Chinese writers. Australian writer Davidson High Court then read a letter from Australian progressive writers to the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Nadim, a famous poet from Kashmir, India, stood up and recited a poem paying tribute to the Chinese people and Chinese writers. He recited his old work from 1949 in the Kashmiri language. In this poem, the poet ruthlessly satirized the warmongers. He said that the warmongers had been defeated everywhere, the beautiful Yangtze River had washed away Chiang Kai-shek, and flowers had bloomed all over the earth. The audience applauded enthusiastically again for his passionate verses. Colombian writer Salamia, New Zealand sculptor Mrs. Garland, and Indian writer Raghavachari expressed their respect to Chinese literary and art workers and put forward suggestions for strengthening cultural exchanges.

Preparatory Committee of the Islamic Association Holds Reception
    The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Islamic Association held a reception on the afternoon of the 18th to welcome Muslims from various countries attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Burhan, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Islamic Association, first warmly welcomed the representatives who worked hard for peace on behalf of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Islamic Association. At the request of the representatives, he briefly introduced the freedom and happy life enjoyed by the various ethnic groups in China who believe in Islam under the people's government's policy of ethnic equality and freedom of religious belief for the past three years since liberation.
    Iraqi representative Gajim El Samawi pointed out in his speech that the doctrine of Islam is peace. He said: "We are very excited to see that our Chinese Islamic brothers follow this doctrine and unite sincerely with the people of all ethnic groups in their country." Finally, he said: "The achievements made by Chinese Islamic brothers today are all due to the just and wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong." His words aroused warm applause from the audience.
    Pakistani representative Tufail Ahmed Jemali and representatives from Syria and Lebanon, Ahmed Kasar, pointed out in their speeches that Burhan's speech proved that the reactionary propaganda of the Anglo-American government's propaganda organs that Chinese Islamic brothers did not have freedom was completely a lie. He wished Chinese Islamic brothers eternal happiness.
    Khorasani from Iran said: "We are very happy that Chinese Muslims warmly support their government, because what this government does conforms to the doctrines of peace, tolerance, and humanity."
    Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, head of the Indian delegation, pointed out in his speech: "In India, Pakistan and other countries, pro-imperialist propaganda said that Muslims in China do not have equality and are not allowed to pray in mosques. The real Islamic life we ‚Äã‚Äãsee in China is a powerful blow to this propaganda."
    Pakistani representative Mir Abdul Gayoom pointed out in his speech that under the control of Anglo-American imperialism, the status of Islam is very low. He assured everyone that thanks to this Peace Conference, Muslims in Pakistan would no longer be influenced by the Anglo-American bloc.
    At the banquet, Muslims from various countries wished each other brotherly friendship. Burhan requested that the "Salaam" (meaning "peace" and "peace") of the Chinese Islamic brothers be brought to Islamic brothers in various countries! (Xinhua News Agency) Correction
