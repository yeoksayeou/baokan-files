Mr. Chairman, friends!

First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the Pakistan delegation, to express our gratitude to the China Peace Committee and the Chinese people for their hospitality, sincerity, and enthusiasm, which are almost unparalleled anywhere in the world. If one does not come to China, it is difficult to understand the spirit of friendship of the Chinese people towards all nations, and it is also difficult to understand how the Chinese people are working hard to achieve the highest ideals of mankind. This is not the only thing we have learned here. We have seen how people all over the world are consciously struggling to preserve humanity and improve their lives. Now, no warmongering group, no matter how powerful it may seem, can drive them to slaughter each other. The Chinese people have played a huge role in this struggle. They have shaken off the shackles of imperialism, thus inspiring the people of Asia and the Pacific region to strive for freedom. This is why the imperialist countries are afraid of letting China into the United Nations.

Today, the most important issue facing the people of this region is to defeat the American conspiracy to rearm Japan and use Japan as a war base, and to prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism, which has caused the loss of millions of lives in China and elsewhere. Equally important is that the Korean War must be stopped, allowing the Korean people to decide their own future. I am very willing to point out that imperialist intervention exists not only in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, but also in Iran, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and other Asian countries. If we each are members of a large family, we should help all those who are being invaded, no matter where they are.

As for this conference, which we have just attended, held in the peace-loving city of Beijing, I believe that it is a historically unique conference in the history of mankind's struggle for peace and progress, because it has achieved such great achievements and has such a broad nature. This conference shows that the peace movement does not belong to any particular political party. Those who participate in this movement have different opinions and beliefs, but they are united for the cause of peace and support the struggle of the various nations oppressed by imperialism for liberation. The imperialist countries say that this movement is a communist movement. This is not in accordance with the facts. I want to tell everyone: I wholeheartedly support this movement, because I hope to see the forces of peace, freedom, friendship, equality, and kindness triumph on a global scale. Moreover, my religion, Islam, is in favor of international cooperation and goodwill among nations. Friends, I would like to assure you that when I return to Pakistan, I will definitely tell our people that the issue of peace is a major issue for your current life and for your great future. I sincerely hope that the people of Pakistan will not lag behind any nation in the work of striving for peace.

Long live the peace movement!
Long live the unity of the people of the world!
Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!
Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani people!

### 巴基斯坦代表团团长  沙里夫演词

    巴基斯坦代表团团长
    沙里夫演词主席先生，朋友们！
    首先请让我代表巴基斯坦代表团向中国人民保卫世界和平委员会及中国人民致谢，感谢他们的款待，诚恳和热情，这些几乎是世界上任何地方所比不上的。假若不到中国来，那就很难了解中国人民对待一切民族的那种友爱精神，同时也很难了解中国人民正在如何努力，以求达到人类最高的理想。这不是我们在这里所学习到的唯一的东西。我们已经看到了全世界人民正在如何为了保存人类和改善其生活，而自觉地斗争。现在，没有一个战争贩子集团，不管看起来怎样强大，能够驱使他们相互屠杀了。中国人民在这个斗争中，起了巨大的作用。他们摆脱了帝国主义的枷锁，从而鼓舞了亚洲和太平洋区域的人民为自由而努力。这就是为什么帝国主义国家害怕让中国进入联合国的缘故。
    今天，这个区域的人民面临着的最重要的问题就是，打败美国重新武装日本和把日本当作战争基地的阴谋，和阻止日本军国主义的东山再起，这个日本军国主义已使中国和别的地方丧失了千百万的生命。同样重要的是，朝鲜战争必须停止，让朝鲜的人民决定他们自己的前途。我很愿意指出，帝国主义的干涉不仅在朝鲜、越南和马来亚存在，同时在伊朗、埃及、突尼斯、阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和其他亚洲国家存在。如果说我们每个人都是一个大家庭中的一员，我们就应该帮助所有受侵略的人，不论他们是在什么地方。
    至于我们刚刚参加过的、在爱好和平的北京城举行的这次会议，我认为，它是人类争取和平与进步的、历史上独一无二的一次会议，因为它得到了那样大的成就，并且有那样广泛的性质。这次会议说明了，和平运动不是属于任何特殊的政党的。参加这个运动的人有不同的见解和信仰，但是他们为了和平事业团结在一起，并且支持那些受帝国主义压迫的各民族争取解放的斗争。帝国主义国家说：这个运动是共产党的运动。这是不符合事实的。我要告诉大家：我全心全意拥护这个运动，因为我希望看到在全世界范围以内，和平、自由、友爱、平等和善良的力量获得胜利。此外，我的宗教，伊斯兰教，是拥护国际合作和国际间的善意的。朋友们，我愿意向你们保证：当我回到巴基斯坦以后，我一定告诉我们的人民，和平问题对于你们现在的生活、对于你们伟大的前途，是一个重大的问题。我诚恳地希望巴基斯坦的人民在争取和平的工作中不会落在任何民族的后面。
    和平运动万岁！
    全世界人民团结万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
    中国和巴基斯坦两国人民友谊万岁！
