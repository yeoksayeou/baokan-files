    New Offensive by the Vietnam People's Army Northwest of Hanoi
    In mid-October, the Vietnam People's Army launched an offensive in the area northwest of Hanoi, capturing Nghia Lo, an important stronghold of the invading French army, annihilating twelve French battalions, and controlling more than eighty kilometers of highway from Yen Bai to Nghia Lo. This victory liberated a vast rice-producing area on the right bank of the upper Red River, further expanding the Vietnam People's Army's anti-Japanese base in northern Vietnam.
    From December of last year to February of this year, the invading French army desperately tried to reverse its decline in the Vietnam War, but the Vietnam People's Army thoroughly shattered this illusion in the famous Hoa Binh Campaign. The victory in capturing Nghia Lo further proves that the Vietnam People's Army has firmly grasped the initiative and superiority in the war, putting the French army in a passive and constantly retreating position.
    After the Hoa Binh Campaign, the invading French army shrank into a few cities and important strongholds such as Hanoi, Saigon, and Hai Phong, pinning its hopes on solid fortifications, vainly attempting to hold these cities and strongholds for a long time. However, with the increasing combat effectiveness of the Vietnam People's Army, important strategic strongholds such as Nghia Lo have also been captured in one fell swoop. This cannot but make the French troops occupying other cities and strongholds feel greatly threatened.
    The Nghia Lo campaign is a serious blow to the American and French aggressors. Since the new French High Commissioner to Indochina, Letourneau, went to the United States in June to beg for aid, the United States' assistance to the French army in Vietnam and its intervention in Vietnam have been further strengthened. The United States pays one-third of France's entire military expenditure in Indochina and supplies a large amount of arms and materials. According to the Associated Press, two hundred American ships arrived in Saigon half a month ago, carrying a large amount of weapons and military supplies. However, Letourneau's fate will not be better than that of his predecessor, Tassigny. The Nghia Lo campaign is the prelude to his death knell.
    This offensive by the Vietnam People's Army has caused great panic among the French ruling clique. French Minister of Defense Pleven, while deceiving himself by saying that the Nghia Lo area "has no important economic and military value," had to admit that "the fall of Nghia Lo is a heavy blow to French prestige." Men like Pinay and Pleven must both implement the US's plan for arms expansion and war preparation and invest limited financial resources in the bottomless pit of the Vietnam War. The difficulties of the French economy have further sharpened and exposed the contradictions between the US and France. However, the French ruling clique does not want to end the war of aggression against Vietnam, and they are still begging for "American aid" to continue their struggle. This can be proved by the recent meeting between Letourneau and US Assistant Secretary of State Allison.
    New and heavier blows are waiting for the French aggressors. The struggles of the French aggressors and the intervention of the United States cannot stop the victory of the Vietnamese people.

### 越南人民军在河内西北的新攻势

    越南人民军在河内西北的新攻势
    十月中旬，越南人民军在河内西北地区发起攻势，攻克了侵越法军一个重要的据点义路，歼灭法军十二个连，控制了安沛到义路间全长八十多公里的公路。这一胜利使红河上游右岸广大的产米地区获得解放，使越南人民军在越北的抗战根据地更加扩大。
    从去年十二月到今年二月间，侵越法军曾拚命企图挽回它在越南战争中的颓势，但是越南人民军在著名的和平战役中，彻底粉碎了法军的这一幻想。这次攻克义路的胜利，更加证明了越南人民军已经牢牢地掌握了战争的主动权和优势，已使法军处于被动挨打和节节败退的境地。
    和平战役后，侵越法军就龟缩在河内、西贡、海防等少数城市和重要据点中，把希望寄托在坚固的防御工事上，妄想长期固守这些城市和据点。然而在越南人民军战斗力日益增长的情况下，像义路这样的重要战略据点也被一举攻克了。这就不能不使那些占据着其他城市和据点的法军感到极大的威胁。
    义路战役是对美法侵略者的严重打击。自今年六月新任法国驻印度支那高级专员勒都尔诺赴美乞援后，美国对越南法军的援助和对越南的干涉是更为加强了。美国支付着法国在印度支那的全部军费的三分之一，并接济了大批军火和物资。据合众社称，半月前就有二百只美国船，载运大批武器和军用物资到达西贡。可是勒都尔诺的命运比他的前任者塔西尼并不会好一些。义路战役就是他的丧歌的前奏。
    越南人民军的这一攻势，引起法国统治集团的莫大惊慌。法国国防部部长普利文，一边自欺欺人地说义路地区“没有重要的经济与军事价值”，一边不得不承认“义路的失陷是对法国威望的一个沉重打击”。比内和普利文之流，又要执行美国的扩军备战计划，又要把有限的财力投入侵越战争的无底洞中。法国经济的困境已使美法之间的矛盾更加尖锐化和表面化。但是法国统治集团并不想结束侵越战争，他们仍在乞灵于“美援”来继续进行挣扎。这一点从最近勒都尔诺和美国助理国务卿艾利逊的会谈，就可以得到证明。
    新的、更加沉重的打击正在等待着法国侵略军。法国侵略者的挣扎和美国的干涉都不能阻止越南人民的胜利。
