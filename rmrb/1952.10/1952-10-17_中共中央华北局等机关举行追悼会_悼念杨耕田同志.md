Those attending the memorial service included: Bo Yibo, Nie Rongzhen, and Liu Lantao, Secretaries of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau; Peng Zemin, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Government Administration Council; Li Baohua, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government; Cheng Zihua, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives; Lai Ruoyu, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Wu Xinyu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs; Qi Yanming and Xu Guangping, Deputy Secretaries-General of the Government Administration Council; Hu Xikui, Vice President of the Renmin University of China, and representatives from various ministries of the Central Government; Liu Xiufeng and Zhang Su, Deputy Directors of the North China Administrative Committee; Yang Shijie, First Deputy Secretary of the CCP Chahar Provincial Committee; Li Jihuan and Lü Fu, Vice Chairmen of the Provincial People's Government; Shi Zhiben, Commander of the Provincial Military Region; and heads and representatives of first-level organs and groups in North China, totaling over 300 people.
    Comrade Yang Gengtian was from Fuping County, Hebei Province, from a poor peasant family. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1932 and engaged in revolutionary activities in the Fuping area, and led the struggle against the official salt shops in Fuping. During the early period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was continuously engaged in the peasant movement in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, leading the work of the border region's peasant associations and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation, becoming a leader beloved by the local peasants. Later, he served as Director of the Administrative Office and Secretary of the District Party Committee. In 1949, he was elected as a peasant representative to attend the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During his three years of service in Chahar Province, he achieved remarkable results and maintained close ties with the local people. He was only thirty-nine years old when he died. Those present expressed deep sorrow for the passing of this young mass leader and outstanding son of the Communist Party. In their eulogies, Yang Shijie, First Deputy Secretary of the CCP Chahar Provincial Committee, and Hu Xikui, Vice President of the Renmin University of China, both pointed out that Comrade Yang Gengtian's close ties with the people, his spirit of being conscientiously responsible for the people's cause, and his hard-working and simple style were all worthy of emulation by revolutionary comrades.
    After the memorial service, Bo Yibo, Nie Rongzhen, Liu Lantao, Liu Xiufeng, Zhang Su and other comrades personally escorted the coffin, and he was buried in the People's Cemetery on the same day.
