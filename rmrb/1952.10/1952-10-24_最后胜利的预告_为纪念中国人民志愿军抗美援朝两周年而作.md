The situation has changed. How many American tank wrecks still lie in those places where the Chinese People's Volunteer Army launched its first and second campaigns! Those rusted steel, those twisted armored hulls, are now mostly lying askew in the fertile fields; the turrets cock their heads, looking up at the interior of North Korea, the slender cannons extending from the turrets like iron teapot spouts, still pointing remotely in the direction of Northeast China; but this can only be a relic of the battlefield. North Korean men and women farmers are now harvesting grain around the graveyards of American tankers. This idyllic scene signifies that the American invaders can no longer come here, and history has made its decision.

Today, on the hundreds of miles of front line across the Korean Peninsula, from the high peaks of the eastern front to the undulating hills of the western front, both the enemy and we have arrayed ourselves in a long, serpentine formation. Wherever you go on the positions of the Korean-Chinese People's forces, you will immediately realize that these positions are practically fortresses more solid than steel, and the enemy cannot advance an inch here. The soldiers guarding the positions will tell you, "The situation is very different now."

On a position where our army is about to launch a counterattack, a commander of a Volunteer Army infantry regiment pointed out to us: "Look, this is the situation on the ground where the enemy and our forces are facing each other, nose to nose, face to face." I saw directly in front of him a 700-meter-high ridge like the spine of a whale, shielding our army's front line like a screen. To the right front of this main position—the high mountain—was a high mountain occupied by the enemy. Between the two mountains was a small triangular hilltop, a vacant area not occupied by either the enemy or us. The enemy and our army were locked in a head-to-head confrontation on this mountain ridge, separated by only about eighty or ninety meters. The regimental commander continued: "At 5:50 this afternoon, we will knock out the enemy's forward position extending from the right side of the triangle!"

We waited for this moment to arrive. Before this, I learned that in the history of warfare, there are often such coincidences: it was precisely on that 700-meter-high mountain in front of us that the enemy desperately attacked our army during the "Autumn Offensive" last year but ultimately failed to capture it. At that time, the enemy forces fighting for this position were the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division, the U.S. 7th Infantry Division, and the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, as well as the Rhee Syngman puppet army's 6th Division. At that time, the enemy frantically attacked our army, and groups of tanks often approached our army's division and regimental headquarters. At that time, one of our battalion commanders reported the situation of the enemy in front to the regimental headquarters:

"The situation is tense – there are 25 tanks, 50 artillery pieces, and 24 aircraft in the air. The enemy's vanguard has deployed two battalions and is attacking from three sides." The regimental commander asked, "What is your determination?"

"Guarantee that the enemy will not be able to get up the mountain!"

The battalion commander put down the telephone receiver and, braving the rain of bullets, ran to the forward position. He wanted to personally see the platoon leader's combat arrangements and understand the morale of the lower-level commanders and fighters. At this time, the platoon leader was taking care of the soldiers to strengthen the fortifications. He said to the soldiers: "Didn't you say you want to protect the security of the motherland? Good fortifications are the only way to eliminate the enemy. The security of the motherland depends on us eliminating the enemy and defending the position."

The battalion commander walked over and asked, "How are you? What's the situation?"

The platoon leader wiped his sweat and said, "The perfect opportunity for a parade has arrived."

The battalion commander didn't understand, so the platoon leader continued, "The soldiers said: Today is October 1st, and we want to have a good parade here. Look, haven't the enemy's planes, infantry, and tanks all come? We will 'write them off' one by one!"

The battalion commander understood and said, "You must spread the fire net, reach out with both hands, pull the enemy in, and then grab their heads—develop short bursts of fire and strike in one go! Strike hard! Strike fiercely! When you have grabbed the enemy by the head here, I will have the artillery give them a waist-level kill, cutting off their tails!—Understood?"

The platoon's operation fulfilled the battalion commander's instructions. The soldiers withstood the enemy's attack and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. The artillerymen also fired whenever and wherever they were called upon. After fighting heroically for four days, the battalion commander asked the platoon leader on the phone:

"How is your position?"

"The position is in our hands." The platoon leader firmly replied, "Battalion commander! We will definitely be able to defend the position!"

The battalion commander observed the heroic resistance of this platoon from the battalion command post. This time, he further understood the strength of his platoon from the platoon leader's tone. He ordered reinforcements to this heroic platoon. At this moment, the enemy attempted to break through the platoon's horseshoe-shaped defense line with an absolute superiority in strength. The platoon leader personally killed seven enemies with his pistol but was knocked unconscious by the enemy's rifle butt. After repelling the enemy, the deputy squad leader immediately carried him down from the position. The platoon leader woke up, felt the blood on his head, and asked, "Why am I down here? Call the Communist Party members together! We want to go and find the enemy and launch a fierce counterattack against them!"

The deputy squad leader told him, "Platoon leader, the position has not been lost. The battalion commander has put the reserve team in place and held off the enemy. We have been relieved to rest."

Now, the regimental commander standing in front of us is precisely the battalion commander who firmly defended the position last year; after our army completely repelled the enemy's "Autumn Offensive," he was promoted to the command position of the regiment. When he recalled the above-mentioned course of the battle, he said to us: "At that time, it was really difficult. I kept my eyes on the map, thinking only of finding a way out of that terrain. But we still defeated the enemy."

Less than a year has passed since then, and the era when our infantry junior commanders had to spread out military maps alone is over forever. Now, around this regimental commander, there are artillery commanders and staff officers sent by the armored forces. I saw them all conducting intense and meticulous pre-war preparations in an orderly manner around the regimental commander.

Now, in this joint command post of various arms of the service, there are telephones, walkie-talkies, and radios. It is through these complex communication devices that they dispatch their various calibers of artillery, issue combat orders, arrange various logistical tasks, and maintain close contact with their superior commanders.

Only half an hour remained before the launch of this counterattack. At this time, the regimental commander made another phone call to the assault troops in front. On the other end of the phone was a platoon leader—the deputy squad leader who carried the platoon leader down from the mountain last year. When the regimental commander asked about the assault platoon's preparations, such as the soldiers' determination, whether they had eaten, whether they had brought ration bags, etc., and especially when he instructed them on the tactical essentials of infantry-artillery coordination, the platoon leader answered concisely: "Everything is ready!" The platoon leader and the soldiers all knew that this phone conversation was not so much a material inspection by the superior as it was a cordial spiritual mobilization and an expression of trust. Because the regimental commander clearly knew that this young platoon leader, who had been tempered in the flames of war, had matured tactically in the past year or two, just like his platoon leader. The regimental commander remembered that when the company participating in the counterattack was transferred to the regimental headquarters for tactical training before this battle, it was this platoon leader who proposed the assault team's operation plan, which was basically consistent with the regimental commander's own tactical thinking and requirements. Therefore, the regimental commander smiled and gently put down the telephone receiver. Not long after, he and the artillery commander and the chief of staff of the armored forces looked at each other's watches. When the hour hand pointed to 5:49:30, they issued an order to the artillery positions:

"Begin firing! Throw the shells out!"

As soon as they put down their telephone receivers, we saw the artillery fire from all positions shooting at the enemy's "nose tip." At this time, night was about to fall, and the red light emitted by our army's artillery fire was mixed with the black soil rising from the explosion of the shells and the rolling yellow and white smoke. This was a devastating blow. In less than twenty minutes, the enemy's deeply entrenched fortifications were completely destroyed. After our artillery extended its fire, the infantry led by the platoon leader captured the enemy's position after only five minutes of combat.

This was the battle in the area known as "Gyeonggi Mountain" by the enemy on the evening of September 6, 1952. United Press reporter Panton reported on this battle: The shells of our army at this time made the enemy's position "look like a strange cemetery." The enemy soldiers killed had "arms, legs, and heads piled up like mountains." Until September 11, the United Press still said: "The soldiers on Gyeonggi Mountain were dazed by the attack of 48,000 artillery and mortar shells from the enemy." Another American news agency, the Associated Press, also reported from Seoul on September 7 with alarm that our army's artillery had "attacked the allied forces along the entire 155-mile front line last night and today, firing mortar and artillery fire that was the most intense in the 26-month Korean War."

In the three days after this battle, our army's infantry and artillery continuously repelled more than 30 enemy counterattacks, killing and wounding more than 1,000 enemy soldiers with intensive gunfire and artillery fire. At this time, the regimental commander happily said to me: "Victory comes like this. In addition to the heroic spirit of our troops, in addition to the improvement of fortifications and supplies, the people of the motherland have also given us quite powerful artillery. Therefore, as long as the situation requires it, we can pour concentrated steel on the enemy's heads like water. They can't stand it."

As he was saying this, four enemy planes came near our command post, taking turns bombing and strafing fiercely. The regimental commander grabbed the phone, just about to order the anti-aircraft units to shoot hard, when the operations staff hung up another phone receiver, smiled, and then said seriously to the regimental commander:

"The anti-aircraft artillery company commander just reported on the phone: An enemy Thunderbolt aircraft was hit five times and fell in front of our 700-high ground position. Another jet aircraft was hit in the wing..."

"Hum! It won't live long." The regimental commander looked at the enemy planes fleeing in the sky, lit a cigarette for himself, and then continued to talk about his experiences on the anti-American and aid-Korea battlefield in the past two years: "If you look at the troops themselves, the fundamental problem is morale—ideology, equipment—tactics. The enemy lacks one of these two. Although the enemy still has a temporary advantage in equipment, their soldiers do not want to fight this meaningless war for their generals. These soldiers do not know why they came to Korea..."

"We, on the other hand, are completely the opposite!" the regimental political commissar added.

"Yes!" said the regimental commander. "We are not only good at attacking, maneuvering, and penetrating, but we have also trained ourselves to be good at defending. Look, we were able to defeat the enemy's offensive from the defense last year, and now we can actively eliminate the enemy with counterattacks in defense. The combat effectiveness of our troops has been unprecedentedly improved and has achieved great development."

At this time, the chief of staff of the armored forces also pointed to a stack of newspapers on the table and said to me: "For example, this joint command post illustrates the changes and development of our equipment and tactics." Indeed, since the long-range artillery he commanded came here and suppressed the enemy's artillery group, the enemy's artillery has had little "say" in this battle. I asked him the reason why the enemy's artillery had been quite "silent" in the past three days. After he answered, he said, "Now the situation has changed greatly. But there will be even greater," he kept gesturing, "greater development and change."

I completely understood his gestures, what they referred to, their meaning... That is the road of continuous development for the people of our motherland to support the Volunteer Army, and that is the truth in the fighting life of the people of the world. It means that if the enemy thinks that it has not suffered enough today and insists on its war of aggression, then it will inevitably be given the final punishment by the Korean-Chinese People's Army. Today, the situation on the Korean front has completely foreshadowed the final victory of our army.

    最后胜利的预告
    ——为纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝两周年而作
    新华社特约记者　黄钢
    情况已经变了，在中国人民志愿军出国进行一、二两次战役的那些地方，现在还躺有多少美国坦克的残骸！那些生锈的钢铁，那些扭曲的铁甲的躯壳，如今多半是歪倒在丰饶的田地上；炮塔翘着头，仰望着北朝鲜的腹地，炮塔上细长的像铁茶壶嘴一样伸出的炮管，仍旧遥指着中国东北的方向；但这只能是战场的陈迹了。北朝鲜的男女农民，现正在美国坦克兵的坟场周围收割谷子。这种田园景色标志着：美国侵略者不能再到这里来了，历史是定案了。
    现今，在横跨朝鲜半岛数百里长的战线上，从东线的高峰，到西线的小山丘起伏地带，敌我双方都摆开了一字长蛇阵。你无论到朝中人民部队那个阵地上，都会立即意识到：这些阵地简直是比钢铁还要坚固的堡垒，敌人休想在这里前进一步。守卫阵地的战士们会向你这样说：“局面大不同了。”
    在一处我军将要发起反击的阵地上，一位志愿军的步兵团长向我们指点道：“你们看看，这就是在地面上敌我两军对峙的情势，鼻子碰着鼻子，面孔对着面孔。”我看他手指的正前方，有一座鲸鱼脊梁样的七百公尺高的山岭，屏风般地掩护着我军的前沿。在这座主阵地——高山的右前方，联接着敌人所占据的一座高山。在两山之间有一个小三角形的山头，是敌我都未占领的空白地点。敌人与我军就是在这一山梁上针锋相对，彼此相隔竟不过八、九十公尺左右。那位团长接着说道：“今天下午五点五十分，我们就要敲掉敌人在三角形右边伸出的前沿阵地！”
    我们等待这一时刻的到来。我在这以前才知道，在作战的历史中常有这样的巧合：恰恰在我们正面的那座七百公尺的高山上，就是去年敌人在“秋季攻势”中向我军拚命猛攻而始终未能得手的地方。那时争夺这座阵地的敌军是：美军第二师、美军第七师和美军第二十四师，还有李承晚伪军第六师。那时敌人疯狂地向我军进攻，成群结队的坦克常常逼近我军师、团指挥所。当时，我军有一位营长曾向团指挥所报告当面敌人的情况：
    “情况紧张——对面是坦克二十五辆，大炮五十门，在空中有飞机二十四架。敌人先头部队展开了两个营，从三面进犯过来了。”团长问：“你的决心怎么样？”
    “保证敌人上不了山！”
    营长放下电话耳机，就冒着弹雨，跑到前沿阵地上去。他要亲自看看连长的战斗布置，同时了解下级指战员的情绪怎么样。这时连长正在照料战士加修工事，他对战士们讲道：“你们不是说要保护祖国安全吗？挖好工事才好消灭敌人，祖国的安全就要靠我们消灭敌人，守卫住阵地。”
    营长走过去问道：“你好！情况怎么样？”
    连长一面擦汗一面说：“正好阅兵的机会到了。”
    营长不明白，连长接着说道：“战士们讲：今天十月一号，我们要在这里好好检阅队伍。你看，敌人的飞机、步兵和坦克不是都来了吗？等我们给它一个个地‘报销’哩！”
    营长会意了，他说道：“你们要把火网张开，伸出两只手去，牵着敌人进来，再抓住它底脑袋——发扬短促火力，一气打！猛猛地打！等你在这里扭住了敌人的头，我就要炮兵给它一个拦腰杀伤，切断它的尾巴！——明白了吧？”
    这个连的作战实现了营长的指示。战士们抵住了敌人的进攻，而且大量杀伤了敌人。炮兵们也随叫随打，叫到那里，就打到那里。英勇战斗到第四天，营长用电话问连长：
    “你们的阵地怎样了？”
    “阵地在我们手里。”连长坚决地回答：“营长！我们一定能够守住阵地！”
    营长从营指挥所观察到这连人英勇顽抗的情况，这回从连长的语气中，进一步知道了他的连队的刚强。他发令增援这个英勇的连队。正在这时候，敌人企图以绝对优势的兵力突进该连的马蹄形防线。连长用自己的短枪一气干掉了七个敌人，自己却叫敌人枪托打得昏倒了。在打退了敌人以后，副班长马上把他从阵地上背下来。连长醒了，摸摸头上的血，问道：“怎么下来了？叫共产党员集合！我们要找敌人去，要向他们猛烈的反击！”
    副班长告诉他：“连长，阵地没有丢。营长在那里放上了预备队，把敌人顶住了。我们是换下来休息的。”
    现在，站在我们面前的这位团长，正是那位在去年坚守阵地的营长；他在我军完全打退了敌人的“秋季攻势”以后，就被提升到团的指挥位置上来。当他回忆上面一段战斗的经过时，向我们说道：“那时候，真困难。我把眼睛就盯在地图上，一心想从那块地形上去找出办法来。可是我们还是把敌人打败了。”
    从那时到今天还不到一年，我们的步兵中级指挥员一个人独自铺开军用地图的时代永远过去了。现在在这团长身边，有着炮兵指挥员和装甲部队派来的参谋人员。我看见他们都在团长身旁有秩序地展开着紧张的细致的战前准备工作。
    现在，在这个各兵种的联合指挥所里，安置了电话机、步行机和无线电。他们就是通过了这些复杂的通讯装置，调度他们的各种口径的大炮，下达战斗的命令，安排各项战勤工作，并与上级指挥员密切联络。
    发起这次反击只剩下半小时了。团长在这时又给前面的突击部队再摇去一次电话。在那边接电话的是一位排长——就是去年坚守那个山头背连长下来的那位副班长。当团长问到突击排的准备工作，例如战士的决心怎样、饭吃了没有、带了干粮袋没有……等等问题，并且特别关照步炮协同的战术要领时，排长都一一扼要地回答道：“一切都准备好了！”排长和战士们都知道：这次电话中的谈话，与其说是上级对于物质方面的检查，不如说是精神上的亲切的动员和信赖的表示。因为团长清清楚楚地知道：这一位从战火中锻炼出来的年青的排长，正像他那连长一样，近一两年来在战术上已经成熟了。当这次战前把参加反击的连队，全部调到团部来作战术训练的时候，团长记得：正是这一位排长提出的突击队作战方案，与团长本人的战术思想和要求基本上是一致的。因此团长微笑着，轻轻地放下了电话筒。不多一会，他就和炮兵指挥员、装甲部队的参谋长一起看着各人的表，当时针指到五点四十九分三十秒的时候，就向各炮兵阵地发出命令：
    “开始射击！把炮弹摔出去吧！”
    他们的电话耳机子刚一放下，我们就看见各阵地的炮火一起射到敌人阵地的“鼻子尖”上。这时，夜幕将要落下，我军炮火发出的红光，与那因炮弹爆炸而腾起的黑土，还有那黄色的白色的翻滚的硝烟相掺杂着。这是毁灭性的打击，不到二十分钟，就把敌人深沟高垒的工事完全摧垮了。当我炮火延伸射击以后，只经过五分钟的战斗，那位排长率领的步兵就夺取了敌人的阵地。
    这就是一九五二年九月六日傍晚的敌人称为“京畿山”地区的战斗。美国合众社记者潘登曾对这个战斗作过这样报道：我军这时的炮弹把敌人的阵地“搞得像一块奇怪的墓地。”击毙的敌军“手臂、腿和头颅堆积如山”。直到九月十一号，合众社还说：“京畿山上的士兵在敌人四万八千发大炮和迫击炮炮弹的袭击下，震动得头昏脑胀”。而美国另一通讯社——美联社也在九月七日从汉城发出的消息中，惊恐地报道我军的大炮在“昨夜和今天袭击一百五十五哩长战线全线的联军部队，发射的迫击炮和大炮炮火，是历时二十六个月的朝鲜战争中最猛烈的”。
    在这次战斗以后的三天中，我军步兵、炮兵连续打退了敌人三十多次反扑，用密集的枪火与炮火毙伤敌军一千多名。这时，团长愉快地对我说：“胜利是这样来的，除了我们部队的英勇精神，除了工事和供应的改进以外，就是祖国人民还给了我们相当强大的炮兵。因此，只要情况需要，我们就可以把集中的钢铁，像水一样地泼到敌人的?子上去，这是他们吃不消的。”
    正在这样说时，四架敌机来到我们指挥所附近，轮番投弹和猛烈扫射。团长抓起话筒，正想命令对空作战部队努力射击时，作战参谋挂下另一个电话耳机笑了一笑然后严肃地对团长说：
    “高射炮连长刚才在电话里报告：敌人一架雷电式飞机，命中五发，落在我们七零零高地阵前。另外一架喷气式飞机，击中翅膀……”
    “哼！寿命不长。”团长看一看在天空中逃跑的敌机，同时给自己点燃香烟，然后他继续说他近两年来在抗美援朝战场上得到的体会：“如果单单从部队本身来看，那根本的问题就是士气—思想，装备—战术。这两条敌人就缺乏一条。尽管敌人目前还具有暂时的装备上的优势，但是，他们的士兵不想为他们的将军打这个无意义的仗，这些士兵不晓得是到朝鲜来干什么的……”
    “我们呢，这一条整整相反！”团政治委员接着说了一句。
    “是的！”团长说：“我们不但是善于进攻，迂回，穿插，而且还锻炼得善于坚守了。你看，我们去年能够从防御中挫败敌人的进攻，现在又能在守备中积极地用反击战消灭敌人。我们部队的战斗力得到了空前的提高，获得了很大的发展。”
    这时，装甲部队参谋长也指着桌上的一叠报纸对我说：“比如这个联合指挥所，就说明了我们装备及战术的变化和发展。”的确，自从他所指挥的远射程炮来到这里把敌人的炮群制压了以后，敌炮在这次战斗中就很少有“发言权”了。我向他问明了这三天来敌炮为什么相当“沉默寡言”的理由，他在解答了以后说：“现在情况是有了很大变化。但是，更大的，”他一直做着手势：“更大的发展和变化，还会到来的。”
    我完全明白了他的手势，它所指的内容、它的含义……那就是我们祖国人民支援志愿军不断发展的道路，那就是世界人民战斗生活中的真理。那是说：如果敌人认为今天还没有吃到足够的苦头和教训，坚持它的侵略战争，那么它必然会受到朝中人民军队给予它最后的惩罚。今天朝鲜前线的情况，已经将我军最后胜利完全预告出来了。
