    Pay Attention to Summarizing Experiences in Basic Construction Design
    The Northeast Industrial Department's Civil Architecture Design Company has promptly summarized its experiences, identified errors and shortcomings in past design work, and proposed future improvements. As a result, it is more confident in facing the even more demanding design tasks next year. This approach is clearly necessary, and all design units should do the same.
    This year, most civil construction projects have been delayed due to design not keeping pace with construction needs, leading to a series of problems and difficulties. In some projects, construction waited for design to begin, and then rushed progress later, resulting in poor quality and rework waste in many projects. Some projects were designed and constructed simultaneously, leading to blind construction. One of the reasons why design work cannot keep up with construction requirements is that many units do not pay attention to surveying and investigation work and do not actively collect design data, thus hindering the development of design work. For example, some people say, "The task is too tight, and there is no time to do surveying and investigation work." Some people mistakenly regard "surveying and investigation work as a formality to be dealt with for superiors," believing that geological data is "dispensable." These views are extremely harmful. In fact, precisely because the task is so tight, surveying and investigation work should be carried out more actively. At the same time, in order to do a good job in basic construction, to be responsible to the people, and to be responsible to the superiors, more attention should be paid to geological surveying and investigation work.
    It is undeniable that all units lack experience in surveying and investigation work. However, experience can be learned. As long as each unit can regularly pay attention to summarizing its work, a lot can be learned from the experience and lessons of failure or success. And the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is the object of our study. As long as we do not mechanically apply it piecemeal and study it carefully, we will be able to learn it well. The experience of the Northeast Industrial Department's Civil Architecture Design Company is a model.
    In the last quarter of this year—the fourth quarter—all design units should seize the time, overcome all difficulties, and in addition to actively doing design preparation work, they should also summarize the work of the past year to accumulate experience for the large-scale economic construction work that is about to come.

    注意总结基本建设设计的经验
    东北工业部土木建筑设计公司及时地总结经验，找出过去设计工作中的错误和缺点，并提出今后改进的办法，因而就比较有信心地来迎接明年更繁重的设计任务。这种做法显然是必要的，各个设计单位都应该这样做。
    今年土木建筑工程，大多数是设计赶不上施工需要，以致延误了开工日期，引起一系列的问题和困难。有的工程，开始等设计，以后又赶进度，造成许多工程质量低劣和返工浪费现象。有的工程，一面设计一面施工，以致陷于盲目施工状态。设计工作所以赶不上施工要求，原因之一，是由于许多单位不重视勘察和调查工作，不积极地搜集设计资料，因此阻碍了设计工作的开展。例如，有些人说：“任务太紧，没有时间来做勘察和调查工作。”有些人错误地把“勘察和调查工作看成是应付上级的手续”，认为地质资料是“可有可无的”。这些看法都是极为有害的。其实，正因为任务很紧，就更应该积极进行勘察调查工作，同时为了作好基本建设。为了对人民负责也对上级负责，就更应该注意地质勘察和调查工作。
    不容否认，各个单位对于勘察和调查工作是缺乏经验的。但是，经验是可以学到的。只要各单位能经常注意总结自己的工作，从失败或成功的经验和教训中，是可以学到很多东西的。而苏联的先进经验，更是我们学习的对象。只要我们不是一鳞一爪地机械地搬用，用心钻研，就一定能学好。东北工业部土木建筑设计公司的经验，就是一个榜样。
    在今年最后一个季度——第四季度的时候，各个设计单位应该抓紧时间，克服一切困难，除了积极地做好设计准备工作外，还应很好总结一年来的工作，为即将到来的大规模经济建设工作积累经验。
