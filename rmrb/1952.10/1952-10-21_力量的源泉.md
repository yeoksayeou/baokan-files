    The Source of Strength
    Song Cheng
    I interviewed Comrade Yu Jingsheng, Deputy Director of Tangshan Steel Plant. Yu Jingsheng is the technical leader of Tangshan Steel Plant's experiment with surface-blown alkaline converter (Bessemer converter) steelmaking method. During the experiment, he came up with solutions to many key technical problems such as reducing blowing loss and removing phosphorus. When I mentioned his contribution to China's steelmaking industry, he said: "This is the creation of the collective heroism of the workers of Tangshan Steel Plant under the leadership of the Party, the administration, and the trade union. I have merely concentrated the wisdom of the masses. Without the masses, no one could have completed such a complex experimental work."

    In the spring of 1951, Wei Ya, a technician from the steelmaking department of Tangshan Steel Plant, suggested using surface blowing to directly convert ordinary pig iron into steel in an alkaline converter. This suggestion was immediately supported by Yu Jingsheng. With the approval of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, Yu Jingsheng actively led this experiment. Starting from August last year, after many experiments and small-scale production, the experiment finally succeeded by the end of June this year, and mass production began. After the news spread, steel plants and factories with converter steelmaking equipment in Southwest, Xinjiang, Shandong, Zhuzhou, Changxindian and other places have sent people to Tangshan Steel Plant to learn, and some factories have already started trial use. After Tangshan Steel Plant adopted the surface-blown alkaline converter steelmaking method, the output has increased by two times compared with double-linked steelmaking, and the cost has been reduced by 14.6%. More importantly, because this steelmaking method is not limited by raw materials, other steel plants in the country with converter equipment will no longer reduce production. At the same time, because converter equipment is simple, investment is small, plant construction is fast, and personnel training is easy, it has a certain position and significance in the development of the steel industry.

    When Tangshan Steel Plant experimented with surface-blown alkaline converter steelmaking, it encountered many difficulties. At the beginning, because they had neither experience nor systematic theoretical knowledge on this issue, many people showed a lack of confidence. Some people advised Yu Jingsheng: "Be steady, don't make mistakes!" Some technicians adopted a hands-off attitude towards the experimental work, and even said strange things behind their backs to打击打击 the enthusiasm of the masses. The workers were very enthusiastic, but they did not know how to operate. Technical difficulties continued to arise, such as: the furnace chamber shrinking, the furnace life not being long, the blowing loss rate increasing, the furnace lining falling off, the steel temperature not being high, and phosphorus removal being difficult. Yu Jingsheng sometimes had the idea of retreating and being conservative, but, as he said: "Whenever I think of relying on the masses, I will get support, and whenever I think of the Party's encouragement, my heart will light up." Therefore, he was able to always rely on the masses, unite with other technical personnel, and, coupled with his own hard work, overcome the difficulties.

    During the experiment, he often went deep into the site to observe the blowing situation, personally selected steel samples and slag samples for chemical analysis and physical testing, and humbly listened to everyone's opinions. Based on these situations and opinions, he proposed the method for the next experiment, and pointed out the difficulties and methods to overcome them. From these works, he deeply realized the power of combining theory with practice and technology with labor. He said that some problems he could not think of a solution to, but when he discussed them with the masses, ordinary workers' one or two sentences could often inspire him to find the key to the solution. They adopted the method of technical seminars to frequently concentrate the creativity of workers and technical personnel to solve various different opinions.

    To promote the wisdom of the masses, we must inspire the masses' consciousness in production. If we want the masses to do this or not to do that, we must let them understand why. Yu Jingsheng said that they have always paid attention to conducting technical theoretical education for workers during the experiment. When workers made mistakes in operation, they always inspired the workers to propose their own ways to correct them, and then展开展开 discussion and conduct experiments seriously. After analysis and experimentation, the workers themselves would be able to judge whether an operation method was good or not. Once, the furnace repair workers came up with a method of repairing the furnace, which was very fast, but the quality was not high, affecting the quality of the steel. At first, they told the workers that this method was not good, but the workers did not believe it. When they brought this issue to the technical seminar and asked the furnace repair workers, steelmakers, and technicians to discuss it together, and organized the furnace repair workers to observe the steelmaking situation, and combined the actual situation to explain the reasoning to them. In this way, the furnace repair workers consciously stopped using that furnace repair method.

    In the work process, Yu Jingsheng also paid great attention to uniting technical personnel with different opinions to work together. At the beginning, he felt that letting these comrades with different opinions participate in the experiment would slow down the progress of the work even more. Therefore, he did not actively unite them. But soon he considered that uniting them would add more strength, and not uniting them would hinder the work more. Therefore, he made many坚苦坚苦 efforts, often telling them about the situation in the work, especially the progress of the experiment, to inspire their enthusiasm. In order to convince them of their different opinions, he extensively collected data for in-depth research, criticized their views, and answered their doubts. Some comrades who were not active before, under his influence and help, also worked hard. He said: "There are great benefits to doing this. It unites comrades, and it also exercises oneself, so that one can conduct a more in-depth study of the problem and make a more thorough observation of the site. Naturally, this is difficult. But overcoming the difficulty is progress. The time when you think about problems so much that you can't sleep is the time when your work progresses the fastest."

    Without painstaking research and hard study of technical theory, it is impossible to lead this experiment well. Yu Jingsheng emphasized this point. Without the guidance of technical theory, the masses would be emotionally depressed and lose confidence when encountering difficulties in the experiment. At the same time, the creativity of the masses is often piecemeal and incomplete, and some valuable opinions of the masses are often unclear and immature at the beginning. If you want to constantly summarize the creativity of the masses, if you want to be good at getting inspiration from the masses, the leader cannot do without studying technical theory. Naturally, without studying technical theory, it is even more impossible to personally solve the key technical problems. During the leadership of the experimental work, Yu Jingsheng was very busy. During the day, he had to guide the experimental work and handle daily production leadership work. Sometimes he had to go to the site late at night to solve problems. However, he not only carefully studied the situation of each furnace opening, but also often insisted on studying at night. When the experiment was basically successful, he systematically studied the experimental situation of one hundred and several dozen furnaces, and wrote more than 20,000 words of summary outside of working hours.

    What is the power that enables a technician from the old society to combine with the masses and treat the construction of the motherland with a high degree of dedication? At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Yu Jingsheng, like ordinary young people, was full of patriotic enthusiasm and the beautiful ideal of benefiting human society with science. He successively entered two pseudo-National Government research institutions. When the Anti-Japanese War was about to be won, he traveled across the ocean to the United States to study. After going around in a big circle, what he saw and heard made him feel that the distance between his ideal and reality was so far! He had never been exposed to progressive political thought, and he could not explain the various unreasonable phenomena around him, so he fell into deep distress and confusion. After liberation, the Chinese Communist Party's policy of "everything for the development of production" greatly encouraged him. "Developing production" is his ideal for many years! He studied the preliminary theory of communism, listened to many reports from leading comrades, and saw the Communist Party and the People's Government's concern and emphasis on production. He said: "All this makes me feel that the policy of 'everything for the development of production' is so affirmative and so clear. In the past, I always felt that politics was a dirty thing. At this time, I discovered that the Communist Party's politics is for the development of production." He understood that the basic reasons why technicians in the past had no place to use their skills and national production could not develop were all because there was a reactionary government in China. Only in liberated China could the ideal of science benefiting society be realized. He strongly demanded to do more work and produce more steel for the country. The experiment of surface-blown alkaline converter steelmaking is one of his greatest efforts to realize this wish. At the same time, for three years, the Chinese Communist Party, like a loving mother, has reached out its hand to him and taught him how to work more and better. For example, before liberation, influenced by the bourgeoisie, technicians despised each other, and there was a deep gap between technicians and workers. But now, after the Party's continuous enlightenment and education, he has gradually established the view of relying on the masses. He relied on the masses, and he also saw the power of the masses, the glorious victory of the collective heroism of the masses, which also illuminated his personal path forward.

    Looking back at the path Yu Jingsheng has traveled, people can see that: living in the happy Mao Zedong era, everything is encouraging people to move forward, and all aspects are extending a helping hand to people. As long as you do not reject these helps, are good at absorbing nutrition, and are willing to engage in坚苦坚苦 labor, you will be able to make a contribution to the great construction cause of the motherland!

    力量的源泉
    宋琤
    我访问了国营唐山钢厂副厂长余景生同志。余景生是唐山钢厂试验表面吹风碱性转炉（贝氏炉）炼钢法的技术领导者，他在试验过程中曾想法解决了减少吹损和去磷等许多技术上的关键问题。当我提起他对我国炼钢事业的这一贡献时，他说：“这是在党、行政和工会领导下唐山钢厂职工的集体英雄主义的创造，我不过是集中了群众的智慧，脱离了群众，任何一个人都不可能来完成这样复杂的试验工作。”
    一九五一年春，唐山钢厂炼钢部技术员魏亚建议用表面吹风的办法在碱性转炉中把一般的生铁直接吹炼成钢，这个建议立即得到了余景生的支持。经过中央重工业部钢铁工业局批准，余景生积极地领导了这个试验。他们从去年八月开始，经过许多次试验和小量生产，到今年六月底，试验终于成功，开始大量生产。消息传出以后，西南、新疆、山东、株州、长辛店等地的炼钢厂和拥有转炉炼钢设备的工厂，都已经先后派人到唐山钢厂学习，有些厂已经开始试用。唐山钢厂采用表面吹风碱性转炉炼钢法后，产量已比双联炼钢增加了二倍，成本减低百分之十四点六，而更重要的，由于这种炼钢方法不受原料的限制，因而国内其他有转炉设备的钢厂，也不会再减产了。同时，由于转炉设备简单，投资少建厂快、训练人员容易，因此在发展钢铁工业中有它一定的地位和意义。
    唐山钢厂试验表面吹碱性转炉炼钢时，曾遇到很多困难。开始，由于他们对于这个问题既无经验又缺少系统的理论知识，很多人表现信心不足。有人劝余景生说：“稳一点吧，不要出毛病！”有些技术人员对于试验工作采取袖手旁观的态度，甚至背后说怪话，打击群众情绪。工人们热情很高，但是不会操作。技术上的困难更是不断而来，比如：炉膛缩小，炉子寿命不长、吹损率增高、炉衬脱落、钢水温度不高、去磷困难等等。余景生有时候也曾出现过退缩保守的念头，但是，正如他所说的：“一想到依靠群众就会得到支持，一想到党的鼓励心里就亮起来了。”因而，他能始终依靠群众，团结其他技术人员，加上自己的刻苦钻研，战胜了困难。
    在试验过程中，他经常深入现场观察吹炼情况，动手挑选钢样、渣样作化学分析和物理检验，虚心听取大家的意见。根据这些情况和意见，提出下一次试验的方法，并且指出困难和克服困难的方法。从这些工作中他深深体会到理论和实际结合、技术和劳动结合的力量。他说，有些问题自己想不出解决办法，和群众一商量，普通工人的一两句话常常可以启示你找着解决问题的关键。他们采用了技术座谈会的办法经常地集中工人、技术人员的创造，解决各种不同的意见。
    要发扬群众的智慧，一定得启发群众在生产中的自觉性。要群众这样做或不这样做，一定得让他们懂得为什么。余景生说，他们在试验过程中一直注意了对工人进行技术理论教育。工人们在操作中有了错误，他们也总是启发工人自己提出改正的办法，而后展开讨论并认真进行试验。经过分析试验，一种操作方法究竟好不好工人自己就会判别了。有一次，修炉的工人想出了一种修炉的方法，修得很快，但是质量不高，影响钢的质量。开始告诉工人这种方法不好，工人不相信。当他们把这问题提到技术座谈会上请修炉工人、炼钢工人和技术人员一起讨论，又组织修炉工人去观察炼钢时的情况，结合实际情况再讲道理给他们听。这样，修炉工人就自觉地不再用那种修炉办法了。
    在工作过程中，余景生也十分注意团结有不同意见的技术人员一起进行工作。开始时，他曾经感觉到让这些有不同意见的同志参加试验，会把工作进度拖的更慢。因而没有积极去团结他们。但不久他就考虑到团结他们就会多增加一份力量，不团结他们工作就会受到更多的阻碍。因此，他曾经做了许多坚苦的努力，经常把工作中的情况，特别是试验的进展讲给他们听，启发他们的积极性。为了说服他们的不同的意见，他广泛地搜集资料进行深入的研究，批判他们的观点，解答他们的疑虑。有些原来不积极的同志，在他的影响和帮助下，也都努力工作了。他说：“这样做是有很大的好处的，团结了同志，也锻炼了自己，使自己对问题能以更深刻的进行研究，对现场做更周密的观察。自然，这是困难的。但是，克服了困难就是进步。想问题想得睡不着觉的时候，就是工作进步最快的时候。”
    自己不刻苦钻研，不努力学习技术理论，也不可能很好地领导这一试验。余景生强调地提出了这一点。没有技术理论的指导，在试验遇到困难时，群众就会情绪低落丧失信心。同时，群众的创造常是零星的不完整的，群众的一些宝贵的意见在开始时也常是不明确不成熟的。要想不断总结群众的创造，要想善于从群众那里得到启发，领导者不钻研技术理论是不成的。自然，不学习技术理论也更无法亲自解决技术上的关键问题。在领导试验工作期间余景生是十分繁忙的，白天，要指导试验工作，要处理日常生产领导工作，有时深夜还要到现场去解决问题。但是，他不但认真研究每次开炉的情况，并且经常在夜里坚持进行学习。在试验基本成功时，他系统地研究了一百几十炉的试验情况，在工作时间以外写出了两万多字的总结。
    是什么力量使得一个来自旧社会的技术人员能够和群众结合，以高度的钻研精神来对待祖国的建设事业？在抗日战争开始时，余景生曾像一般青年人一样，满怀着爱国热情和以科学造福于人类社会的美丽的理想。他先后进了两个伪国民政府研究机关。在抗日战争将要胜利时，他又远涉重洋到美国去学习。兜了一个大圈子，但所见所闻，使他感到自己的理想和现实距离得是那样远！他没有接触过进步的政治思想，他无法解释围绕在他周围的各种不合理的现象，因而陷于深深的苦闷和迷惘之中。解放后，中国共产党“一切为了发展生产”的政策使他大大振奋起来。“发展生产”，这是他多少年来的理想！他学习了共产主义的初步理论，听了许多领导同志的报告，看到了共产党和人民政府对生产的关心和重视。他说：“这一切都使我感到‘一切为了发展生产’的政策是那么肯定，那么明确。过去，我总觉得政治是肮脏的东西。这时发现了共产党的政治就是为了发展生产”。他明白了过去技术人员无处施展本领，国家生产不能发展的基本原因，都是因为中国存在着一个反动的政府，只有在解放了的中国，科学为社会造福的理想才得以实现。他强烈地要求多做工作，多为国家生产钢铁。表面吹风碱性转炉炼钢的试验，就是他实现这个愿望的一个最大的努力。同时，三年来，中国共产党像慈母一样，向他伸出了手，教给了他怎样工作得更多更好。例如解放前，受资产阶级的影响，技术人员互相轻视，技术人员和工人之间隔阂很深。而现在，经过党的不断启发和教育，他逐渐树立了依靠群众的观点。他依靠了群众，也就看到了群众的力量，群众集体的英雄主义的胜利的光辉，也照亮了他个人前进的道路。
    回顾余景生走过的这一段路程，人们可以看到：生活在幸福的毛泽东时代，一切都在鼓舞着人们前进，各方面都在向人伸出帮助的手，只要你不拒绝这些帮助，善于吸取营养，肯于从事坚苦的劳动，你就会对祖国的伟大建设事业有所贡献！
