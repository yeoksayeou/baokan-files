    Visiting Japanese Peace Delegates
    By our reporter Cui Qi
    Our reporter visited the Japanese delegation that overcame numerous difficulties to arrive in Beijing and successfully participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The acting head of the delegation, Mr. Nakamura Gan'emon, the deputy head, Mr. Minami Hiroshi, member Mr. Sakurai Hideo, and the Japanese representative serving as deputy secretary-general of the Peace Conference, Mr. Kameta Togo, told us about many things that the Chinese people are concerned about.
    Mr. Kameta Togo spoke about the enthusiastic welcome the Japanese people gave to the Peace Conference before they came to China. He said, "Initially, the Japanese people elected thirty-six representatives to participate in the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing, but the Japanese government refused to issue passports and asked the people to abandon the idea of going to China. However, the movement of the Japanese people demanding to go to China is growing day by day. Going to China is for peace and for trade, so this movement includes a very broad range of classes. Later, Mr. Kora Tomi, Mr. Miyakoshi Kisuke, and Mr. Hoashi Keizo represented the Japanese people to participate in the preparatory meeting. After they returned to China, they truthfully reported that the new China is demanding peace and is willing to carry out mutually beneficial trade."
    Mr. Kameta Togo said, "The Japanese people welcomed Kora Tomi, Miyakoshi Kisuke, and Hoashi Keizo like heroes." At the welcome rally for Kora Tomi in Hibiya, Tokyo, 3,000 women participated, including representatives from many conservative groups. Such welcome rallies were also held in Osaka, Nagoya, Kobe, Minato, Yokohama, Sendai, and Sapporo. Their slogan was: "Send peace and trade envoys to China!" Miyakoshi Kisuke called on the Japanese people to actively send representatives to Beijing to participate in the Peace Conference! Kora Tomi said, "Mothers can also go with their children, because there are many nurseries in Beijing that can take care of your children." As a result, many housewives also asked to come to China. Thus, the number of representatives initially selected was 200, and later increased to 488.
    How did the Japanese people's desire for peace become so strong? After the four representatives introduced the current situation of the Japanese people's lives, you will have a deeper understanding of this issue.
    Mr. Sakurai Hideo, a Japanese industrialist and businessman, said: "After the Korean War, the Japanese economy has further become a vassal of the American war economy. War finance and the militarization of production have caused inflation, and the living standards of the people are declining day by day. Before the Korean War, the Japanese people's consumption level only recovered to 75% of the pre-World War II level, and after the Korean War, it dropped to 70%. The living standards of workers are now only 65% of the pre-war level. The national income of people who rely on salary income is also mostly below the average income level. These are all the bad results of the Japanese government's compliance with the US war policy."
    Mr. Kameta Togo, the Executive Chairman of the Japan Chemical Industry Workers' Union, told us about the life and struggles of Japanese workers. He said: "The wages that workers receive always cannot keep up with soaring prices. Their income is only enough to eat, and they cannot afford to buy clothes and other things. Workers' families must also go out to work to make a living. The number of out-of-school children is increasing year by year. After the outbreak of the Korean War, the working hours in factories have been extended, and the workload has increased by 20% to 50%. In the past, the worker welfare fund was paid by the factory, but now workers have to pay for it themselves.
    "But what workers feel the most painful is not only these. Many factory directors and foremen who rely on American power arbitrarily oppress workers. As long as workers say progressive words in the workshop, they will be fired. Workers feel suffocated. They urgently demand political freedom.
    "Because the labor intensity has been greatly strengthened, many workers have been laid off. Before we came to China, Mitsui Chemical, Japan Soda, and Hodogaya companies laid off workers by the thousands. The unemployed workers had no choice but to find odd jobs, but they were not easy to find. They live in hunger. Cases of murder and suicide due to life pressures have increased. According to statistics, 16,536 people committed suicide in Japan last year, almost one person every half hour. The government is trying every means to pull these desperate unemployed people into the so-called police reserve force to be cannon fodder for aggression, and recruitment advertisements are posted at the gates of factories that have laid off large numbers of workers."
    Mr. Kameta Togo continued: Facing such a reality of life, the workers deeply realized that if they do not change this foreign occupation system and war preparation policy, they cannot obtain the right to survival and cannot improve their lives. The workers' political and economic demands became more obvious after the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty. They shouted slogans such as "Oppose War," "Oppose Unilateral Treaty," and "Oppose Conscription." Many reactionary and conservative trade unions also participated in the workers' democratic struggle.
    Workers who work in munitions factories and military bases are more painful in their lives and spirits, and they have also launched heroic struggles.
    Mr. Kameta Togo mentioned the world-renowned struggle of Japanese workers on this year's May Day. He said: "The May Day struggle gave Japanese workers great encouragement. People's Square is a symbol of Japanese territory. The Japanese workers occupied People's Square for three hours, which is equivalent to taking back Japanese territory from the United States for three hours. Opposite the square is the headquarters of the occupying forces. The Japanese workers carried out an open struggle against the occupation system here. This is the glorious first page of the national independence movement."
    When concluding this issue, Mr. Kameta Togo said: "Japanese workers are now very concerned about the peasant issue and are working hard to cooperate with the peasants. They know that workers cannot be liberated without the liberation of peasants. Japanese workers are also concerned about the unification of the workers' movement. In order to strive for national independence, peace, and democracy, we have the confidence to unify the national workers' movement."
    The reporter inquired about the situation of the Japanese cultural circles. Mr. Nakamura Gan'emon, an actor loved by the Japanese people, and Professor Minami Hiroshi of Tokyo National Hitotsubashi University, told us that in order to turn Japan into its military base and colony, the occupying forces began to trample on Japanese culture and education from the very beginning. For example, in the early days of the occupation, paper was very scarce, but the occupiers printed and distributed a large number of reactionary publications. The reactionary Japanese version of "Reader's Digest" was sold in large quantities, but dramas depicting the tragic lives of American metropolises could not be staged. Freedom of speech was also deprived.
    Now the number of Japanese films has increased by 30% compared with before the war, but because the people are unwilling to watch them, the audience has decreased by 10% compared with before the war. In 1951, Japan imported 215 films, of which 150 were American films. American films depicting corrupt lives and Japanese films promoting the spirit of Bushido occupied all the cinemas, while progressive films were banned by the so-called "Film Ethics Committee."
    The Japanese cultural circles are fighting to preserve traditional culture and strive for peace. The female painter Akamatsu Toshiko's "Picture of the Atomic Bombing" and the democratic film "No, We Want to Live!" produced by mass fundraising have had a great impact.
    Professor Minami Hiroshi said, "I believe that the day when the healthy culture of the Japanese people will drive out the corrupt culture of foreign countries is not far away."
    Finally, the representatives talked about their impressions and feelings about this Peace Conference. Mr. Nakamura Gan'emon said: "I was very moved by the joint statement of India and Pakistan. This is a symbol of peace, symbolizing that the power of peace fills the whole world, and it will achieve victory in all aspects. This friendly statement was produced under the influence of the Chinese people, and I think everyone will have such feelings."
    Mr. Sakurai Hideo said: "This is the greatest achievement of the conference that peace people from 37 countries gathered together to discuss and make completely unanimous resolutions. Due to the American occupation, Japan is isolated from the outside world. In the past, the views on the peace movement were not as broad as they are today. Now the direction is clearer, and we have the opportunity to contact each other."
    Mr. Kameta Togo said: "The people of many of our countries are oppressed by imperialism. At this conference, we can all speak freely, pour out our grievances, and encourage each other. The way the conference was conducted and the democratic atmosphere of knowing everything and saying everything also deeply moved me. I am one of the staff members participating in the organization of the conference. I personally feel that this democratic style was promoted by our Chinese friends, and my gratitude for this is indescribable. Many scenes at this Peace Conference moved me very much, and I shed tears several times."
    In parting, they expressed to the reporter that they will bring the spirit and resolutions of this Peace Conference back to the country and to the Japanese people to promote the development of the Japanese peace movement and to promote the friendly cooperation and economic and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese peoples.

    访问日本和平代表
    本报记者　崔奇
    记者访问了突破重重困难到达北京、胜利地参加了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的日本代表团。代理团长中村玩右卫门先生、副团长南博先生、团员樱井英雄先生和担任和平会议副秘书长的日本代表龟田东伍先生，向我们讲述了中国人民所关心的许多事情。
    龟田东伍先生谈起他们到中国前，日本人民热烈迎接这次和平会议的情形。他说：“日本人民起初为了参加在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议，曾选出三十六位代表，但是日本政府拒不发给护照，并要人民打消到中国去的念头。但是日本人民要求到中国去的运动却一天天高涨着。到中国去是为了和平，是为了进行贸易，所以这个运动包括了非常广泛的阶层。后来高良富、宫腰喜助和帆足计三位先生代表日本人民参加了筹备会议，他们回国之后，真实地报道了新中国是要求和平的，并愿意进行互利的贸易。”
    龟田东伍先生说：“日本人民像欢迎英雄一样地欢迎高良富、宫腰喜助和帆足计。”在东京日比谷欢迎高良富的大会上，有三千妇女参加，其中有许多保守团体的代表。这样的欢迎会也在大阪、名古屋、神户、港山、横滨、仙台和札幌等地举行过。他们的口号是：“派遣和平与贸易使节到中国去！”宫腰喜助号召日本人民踊跃派遣代表到北京来参加和平会议！高良富说：“母亲们抱着小孩子也可以去，因为北京有许多托儿所可以照顾你们的小孩子。”于是有许多家庭主妇也要求到中国来了。这样，最初选出代表二百人，后来更增到四百八十八人。
    日本人民要求和平的愿望这样强烈，是怎么产生的呢？当四位代表先生介绍了日本人民的生活现况后，你就会对这个问题有更深的体会。
    日本工商业家樱井英雄先生说：“朝鲜战争后，日本经济已进一步成为美国战争经济的附庸。战争的财政和生产的军事化，引起通货膨胀，国民生活水平一天天下降。在朝鲜战争以前，日本国民消费水平只恢复到第二次世界大战前的百分之七十五，朝鲜战争以后，又下降到百分之七十。工人生活水平现在只到大战前的百分之六十五。靠薪水收入的人们的国民所得，也大部在平均所得水平以下。这些都是日本政府遵行美国的战争政策的恶果。”
    担任日本大化学产业工会执行委员长的龟田东伍先生向我们谈了日本工人的生活和斗争。他说：“工人得到的工资，总是赶不上飞涨的物价，他们的收入只够吃饭，添衣服和买东西都谈不到。工人的家属也必须出外找工作，才能糊口。失学的儿童一年比一年增多了。朝鲜战争爆发后，工厂的劳动时间都延长了，工作分量增加百分之二十到五十。工人福利基金过去由厂方出，现在也要由工人自己出了。
    “但是工人感到最痛苦的还不只这些。许多仰仗美国势力的厂长和工务主任肆意压迫工人。只要工人在车间里讲进步的话，就要被开除。工人感到透不过气来。他们迫切要求在政治上得到自由。
    “因为劳动强度被大大加强，有许多工人就被解雇。在我们来中国前，三井化学公司、日本曹达公司和保土谷公司就在成千成千地开除工人。失业的工人只好找零工做，但又不好找。他们过着饥饿的生活。为生活所迫而杀人和自杀的事件增多了。据统计，日本去年一年中有一万六千五百三十六个人自杀，差不多每半小时就有一个人自杀。政府千方百计地想把这些走投无路的失业者，拉进所谓警察后备队做侵略炮灰，募兵的广告就贴在那些大批解雇工人的工厂门口。”
    龟田东伍先生接着说：面对着这样的生活现实，工人们深深体验到：如果不改变这种外国占领制度和备战政策，就不能取得生存权利，就不能改善生活。工人的这种政治要求和经济要求，在旧金山和约签订后是更加明显了。他们高呼：“反对战争”、“反对片面和约”和“反对征兵”的口号。有许多反动和保守的工会也参加了工人的民主斗争。
    在军火工厂和军事基地工作的工人，生活上和精神上更加痛苦，他们也展开了英勇的斗争。
    龟田东伍先生提到举世周知的日本工人在今年“五一”劳动节的斗争。他说：“‘五一’劳动节的斗争给日本工人以极大鼓励。人民广场是日本领土的象征，日本工人把人民广场占领了三小时，就等于把日本领土从美国手中夺回来了三小时。广场的对面就是占领军总部，日本工人就在这儿进行了公开地反对占领制度的斗争，这是民族独立运动的光辉的第一页。”
    当结束这个问题时，龟田东伍先生说：“日本工人现在很关心农民问题，并努力与农民合作。他们知道，农民不解放，工人也不能解放。日本工人也关心工人运动的统一问题。为了争取民族独立、和平民主，我们有信心把全国工人运动统一起来。”
    记者询及日本文化界的状况。为日本人民所爱戴的演员中村玩右卫门先生和东京国立一桥大学南博教授告诉我们说，占领军为了把日本变为它的军事基地和殖民地，一开始就对日本的文化教育进行蹂躏。例如在占领之初，纸张很缺，可是占领者却印发了大量的反动出版物。反动的“读者文摘”日文版大量销行，但表现美国大都市的悲惨生活的戏剧却不能上演。言论的自由也被剥夺了。
    现在日本的电影片子比战前增加了百分之三十，但是由于人民不愿意看，观众比战前倒减少了百分之十。一九五一年日本进口的电影片达二百一十五种，其中一百五十种都是美国片子。描写腐朽生活的美国片子和宣扬武士道精神的日本片子，占据了所有的影院，而进步的影片却被所谓“电影伦理委员会”禁止上演。
    日本文化界正为保存传统文化，为争取和平而斗争。女画家赤松俊子的“原子弹轰炸之图”，由群众积资而摄制的民主影片“不，我们要活下去！”等，都发生了很大的影响。
    南博教授说：“我相信日本人民的健康文化驱逐外国的腐败文化的日子已经不远了。”
    最后，几位代表谈到对这次和平会议的印象和感想。中村玩右卫门先生说：“印度和巴基斯坦的联合声明使我很感动。这是一个和平的象征，象征着和平的力量充满着全世界，它将在各个方面都取得胜利。这个友好的声明是在中国人民的影响下产生的，我想每人都会有这样的感想。”
    樱井英雄先生说：“这次三十七个国家的和平人士齐集一堂，进行商谈，并作出了完全一致的决议，这是会议的最大成就。由于美国的占领，日本和外界隔离，过去对和平运动的看法没有今天这样广阔，现在方针更明确了，并使我们得到互相联系的机会。”
    龟田东伍先生说：“我们许多国家的人民都受到帝国主义的压迫，在这次大会上我们都能自由地讲话，把苦水吐出来了，并且彼此都得到鼓励。会议进行的方式，知无不言的民主空气，也深深打动了我。我是参加大会组织工作的人员之一，我亲身感到，这种民主作风是由中国朋友们促成的，我对这一点的感谢之情是无法形容的。这次和平会议上的许多场面，使我非常感动，我曾几次流了泪。”
    在告别时，他们向记者表示：他们将把这次和平会议的精神和决议带回国去，带给日本人民，以促进日本和平运动的发展，并促进中日两国人民之间的友好合作以及经济与文化交流。
