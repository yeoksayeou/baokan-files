    The Capitalist of Beijing Private Hua Dong Iron Factory Should Be Punished for Disregarding Workers' Lives

    Editor: Ma Jiepu, the capitalist of the Beijing Private Hua Dong Iron Factory, disregarded safety equipment and forced workers to work overtime, resulting in the electrocution death of foundry worker Cao Yanzhen.

    On September 17th, the capitalist assigned workers Cao Yanzhen, Dong Jianzhang, and Zhang Wenda to work overtime at night to make tee pipes. However, the hand-held safety lamps used by the factory at night were poorly installed and frequently leaked electricity. The factory's trade union labor insurance committee had raised the issue with the capitalist, saying, "The safety lamps are dangerous and must be inspected before use." But Ma Jiepu said, "These are much better than the ones used before, I will be responsible if anything happens." As a result, Cao Yanzhen was electrocuted while using a hand-held safety lamp that day and died despite emergency medical treatment.

    We believe that the behavior of Ma Jiepu, the capitalist of the private Hua Dong Iron Factory, in neglecting the safety of workers' lives is serious. In addition, Huiguang Electric Appliance Store, which installed the hand-held safety lamps for the factory, should also bear considerable responsibility for this matter. We hope that the Beijing Labor Bureau and the Trade Union will handle this matter.

    北京私营华东铁工厂资方玩忽工人生命应受惩处
    编辑同志：北京市私营华东铁工厂资方马洁圃，不重视安全设备，强制工人加班加点，造成翻砂工人曹燕真触电死亡事故。
    九月十七日，资方指定工人曹燕真、董建章、张文达三人夜间加班做三通管子。而该厂夜间工作使用的手用保险灯安装不良，经常走电。该厂工会劳动保险委员虽曾向资方提出过，“保险灯有危险，必须经过检查再使用。”但马洁圃说：“这比以前用的强多了，出了事我负责。”结果，曹燕真当天使用手用保险灯时就触了电，经医生紧急救治无效，不幸身死。
    我们认为私营华东铁工厂资方马洁圃忽视工人生命安全的行为是严重的。另外，给该厂安装手用保险灯的惠光电料行对这件事也应负相当责任。我们希望北京市劳动局和工会对这件事予以处理。
