Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 13th – On October 7th, the U.S. side wounded sixteen of our captured personnel in the Koje Island POW camp. On October 11th, the U.S. side again wounded four of our captured personnel on Koje Island. General Nan Ri, chief representative of our delegation to the Korean Armistice Talks, lodged a protest with the other side on the 13th, pointing out that the other side can by no means escape the grave responsibility for the war crime of massacring prisoners of war.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th – On October 11th, the U.S. side again wounded four of our captured personnel in the Koje Island POW camp. According to reports from U.S. news agencies, this incident occurred because our captured personnel "protested" the U.S. guards taking away a prisoner of war, and were thus killed and wounded by the guards. Four days prior to this, the U.S. side also announced that sixteen of our prisoners of war had been wounded in this POW camp. According to the U.S. side, these wounded prisoners of war were all "die-hard communists." Obviously, all prisoners of war who resolutely oppose forced retention and demand repatriation are regarded as "die-hards" and are subjected to arbitrary massacres by the U.S. side. This is the so-called "humanitarian principle" and "individual rights" of the Harriman and Acheson clique.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th – On October 8th, the same day that the U.S. side unilaterally suspended the Korean Armistice Talks, U.S. military aircraft violated the agreement by intruding into the airspace over the Panmunjom conference area. On the same day, the U.S. side also shelled the conference area, and the shells exploded within the conference area. On the 12th, our chief liaison officer lodged a protest with the other side, demanding that the other side take responsible action. The other side expressed regret over the incident of aircraft intruding into the airspace over the conference area, claiming that they would strive to prevent similar incidents from occurring, but they still adopted a delaying attitude towards the shelling of the conference area, claiming that the materials were insufficient and demanding a joint investigation. Our liaison officer pointed out that the shelling of the conference area had already been confirmed by the security officers of both sides in the conference area. However, in order to remove all excuses from the other side, they still agreed to the other side's request for a joint investigation. The liaison officers of both sides dug up shrapnel at the site of the shell explosion in the conference area, and the other side promised to respond after examining the shrapnel.

    南日将军抗议美方连续打伤我方被俘人员
    我方联络官抗议美方又一次破坏会场区协议的行为
    【新华社开城十三日电】十月七日美方在巨济岛战俘营打伤我方被俘人员十六人，十月十一日美方又在巨济岛上打伤我方被俘人员四人。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军在十三日向对方提出抗议，指出对方决不能逃脱对屠杀战俘的战争罪行所负的严重责任。
    【新华社开城十二日电】美方于十月十一日在巨济岛战俘营内又打伤我方被俘人员四名。据美方通讯社透露：这一事件发生的原因，由于我方被俘人员“抗议”美方警卫抓走一个战俘，而遭到了警卫的杀伤。在这四天以前，美方也曾公布在这个战俘营内打伤我方战俘十六名。按照美方的说法，这些被打伤的战俘都是“死硬的共产党人”。显然，所有坚决反对强迫扣留要求遣返回家的战俘，都要被目为是“死硬分子”而遭到美方的恣意屠杀。这就是哈利逊、艾奇逊之流的所谓“人道原则”、“个人权利”。
    【新华社开城十二日电】十月八日在美方片面中止朝鲜停战谈判的同一天，美方军用飞机违反协议，侵入板门店会场区上空，同日美方并炮击会场区，炮弹在会场区内爆炸。十二日，我方首席联络官向对方提出抗议，要求对方作负责处理。对方对飞机侵入会场区上空的事件表示遗憾，声称：将努力防止类似事件的发生，但对炮击会场区的事件仍然采取了拖延的态度，声称：材料不足，要求共同调查。我方联络官指出：炮击会场区的事件已由双方会场区安全军官调查证实。但为了解除对方一切藉口，仍然同意了对方进行共同调查的要求。双方联络官在会场区内炮弹爆炸地点掘出了弹片，对方应允在检验弹片后给予答复。
