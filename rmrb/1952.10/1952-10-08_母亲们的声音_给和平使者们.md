Mothers' Voices
——To Peace Envoys
Jin Feng

(I) "We gave life, we must defend life!"

"We gave life, we must defend life," this is the solemn voice of mothers. I walked into the place where life is born—the obstetrics and gynecology department of a hospital, heard the cries of newborn babies, and saw the tired but happy faces of mothers. Life was active everywhere. Xiao Yushan, a nurse at this hospital, has seen five or six hundred babies pass through her hands. Each birth brings her worry, surprise, and joy. But it was not until she became a mother herself that she realized the happiness and hardship of a mother, and she realized how difficult it is for a life to be born. She smiled a little shyly and said, "When that little thing was still in my belly, I had so much anxiety, expectation, and unease! A sense of responsibility fell upon me, making me often think of him involuntarily: What is he like? Will he grow up safely and healthily? What will he encounter in the future?" Speaking of this, she took a light breath, "He was born safely. I feed him, and my eyes are unwilling to leave him for a moment. Too much milk, I'm afraid he'll choke; too little milk, I'm afraid he won't have enough to eat. As soon as my husband comes, he's busy asking when to give him the BCG vaccination, when to give him the injection, busy worrying about him. It's really not easy for a life to grow up." We started talking about the birth of her child, talked about the child's future, talked about a peaceful and happy life, and also talked about the current threat of war. Her mood became heavy. She was silent for a while, and said slowly and powerfully, "Since we have given life, we must defend life. No one knows the difficulty and preciousness of a life better than a mother. For us mothers, peace is our life, our flesh and blood, the happy future of our children!" Saying this, she hugged her child tightly and said:
　　“If a bomb falls now, no problem, I will definitely cover him with my body.”

I heard the same words from Huang Yuehua, a mother of eight children, but she added, "I have so many children, which one should I hold?" Therefore, she called on thousands of mothers to unite to "save the children! Save peace!" She is very concerned about the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference being held in Beijing. She and her children are enthusiastically reading and discussing news and articles about the peace conference.

(II) Let "Peace" grow up happily!

"Let 'Peace' grow up happily," this is the voice of Yang Zisheng, the mother of a newborn baby named "Peace," a young literary and art worker in the army.

I sat in front of her bed. Her loose braids hung over her shoulders. She is a lovely mother. She happily told me: "I didn't feel any pain when giving birth to the child. I worried so much for nothing. My mother and grandmother told me: a woman giving birth is like walking around in hell. But when I gave birth to my child, because of the painless childbirth method, I didn't feel any pain at all. This is only possible in the era of peace, in the era of Chairman Mao. The child was born to welcome peace." She paused, looked at me, and blushed a little: "So, we named him 'Peace.'" Golden sunlight poured in straight from the large glass window. She cheerfully called out: "What good weather! I often think, 'Peace'," she smiled gently, "My child, will grow up like a flower in such sunshine. I think, he may become a doctor in the future, or an engineer, or do creative work like his father, or love acting like me. In any case, in New China, children will definitely take the path of justice and grow up happily."

Yes, "Peace" will grow up happily, and thousands of children in New China will grow up happily. This is not only the belief of her, this young mother, but also the belief of thousands of mothers in New China. Their voices are gentle, but firm.

(III) We must never allow imperialism to harm our children again

Not every mother and child is as happy as Xiao Yushan, Yang Zisheng, and their children. The Chinese mothers who have suffered from the ravages of war have not forgotten the past sorrow. The war of Japanese imperialism's aggression against China caused millions of Chinese mothers to lose their children. Here are the painful and angry voices of some of the mothers. This is Wei Huiming, whose child was killed by a bomb of the evil Japanese imperialism. The broken little arms and legs are shaking in her heart every morning and evening. Many children died from eating mixed noodles when the Japanese invaders ruled Beijing. Here is old lady Chang, she gave birth to ten children, and eight of them died from hunger and cold. In the first year that the Japanese invaders occupied Beijing, she lost four children. At that time, mothers stood in line from night to dawn, and the little soybean cake they bought back was not enough for the children to eat. This is Aunt Zhou, her child had diarrhea from eating it, and finally became skin and bones. The Japanese invaders came to catch people with "cholera," and anyone who had diarrhea was thrown alive into the lime pit. Aunt Zhou hugged her child in panic, hiding from this alley to that alley, running until her legs were swollen. Her own child, she couldn't bear to watch him being buried in the lime pit. "The child finally grew up, but because of the damage in the past, he is still skinny and always sick." At this point, she cried, and many mothers next to her shed tears with her.

Nothing can measure the grief of a mother losing her child. I walked into an ordinary family in Xicheng, Beijing, where the mother was enduring great pain. This old lady Xu gave birth to a total of thirteen children. Except for one who was very young, she personally raised twelve children and survived the difficult years of the old society. The dense wrinkles on her forehead marked her hard work. Finally, after liberation, the children were either working or studying. What awaited the old lady was a happy old age. Unexpectedly, not long ago, she suddenly received a letter from her eldest son-in-law. Her daughter was killed by the bacteria spread by American imperialism. The daughter died and left behind a five-year-old child. This was a terrible blow to the old lady. She never thought she would lose her child now. Her heart aches for her daughter, and she feels even more sorry for her little grandson who lost his mother. The old lady used to be busy with housework all day and rarely went out to participate in gatherings. When she heard the children talking about opposing imperialism, she couldn't figure out what imperialism was. Now, she gritted her teeth and said tremblingly: "This time I understand what imperialism is, it is the monster that makes mothers lose their children and children lose their mothers. I have to fight it to the death." I told her that it was useless to fight it alone. A peace conference is being held in Beijing, and many countries have sent representatives to meet and discuss how to stop imperialism from running rampant and how to prevent mothers from being taken away from their children. The old lady understood, and she nodded quickly, asking me to tell the representatives: we must never allow imperialism to take away our children again. This is the voice of a sad and angry mother.

(IV) We have the power to protect our children

The mothers of New China, the mothers who have stood up, not only have the determination but also the power to protect their children. Thousands upon thousands of mothers sent their children to the Korean front to fight for peace. Many mothers directly went to the forefront of defending peace and protecting their children, and Lv Xiyan was one of them. More mothers are active on various fronts at home. Aunt Zhou, old lady Chang and many other housewives have participated in the sanitation and security work of the streets. They have consolidated the basic-level people's democratic power. More and more mothers have also joined the production front. They are working for peace every day and every hour, adding strength to the cause of peace.

I walked into a factory's nursery. Here, mothers are happily breastfeeding their children. "Zhao Yushu, your challenge conditions are not low!" A young female worker happily called out to another female worker who was bowing her head to breastfeed. Zhao Yushu raised her head and shouted, "You are welcome to accept the challenge, Zhang Jinghui." I asked Zhao Yushu what her challenge conditions were. She said with a smile: "It's not high, the output exceeds the quota by 50%, and the quality is 100% guaranteed."

The bell for work rang. In the workshop, I saw Zhao Yushu, Zhang Jinghui and other mothers bowing their heads and stepping on their machines, concentrating on production. In front of their machines, there were small red flags marking the excellent results. The trade union comrade who accompanied me on the tour told me that in order to welcome the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, the female workers launched a production competition, which has been going on for a week. Zhao Yushu sews trousers, originally planned to sew sixteen a day, now she does twenty-five; Zhang Jinghui sews inside bindings, originally planned to do twenty-seven a day, now she does forty.

This is the loudest voice of mothers defending peace and protecting children! (Attached photo)

“In order to protect their children, Asian women will be with peace-loving people all over the world, resolutely defending peace. …” Huang Yuehua’s eight children gathered around their mother to listen to her reading Soong Ching Ling’s report at the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference.

Xiao Yushan put down the "Defend Peace" magazine in her hand and picked up her child. She said: "For us mothers, peace is our life, our flesh and blood, the happy future of our children." (People's Daily Manuscript)

    母亲们的声音
    ——给和平使者们
    金凤
    （一）“我们给予了生命，我们要保卫生命！”
    “我们给予了生命，我们要保卫生命”，这是母亲们庄严的声音。我走进那降生着生命的地方——一个医院的妇产科，听到新生婴儿的呱呱啼叫，看到那母亲的疲劳而幸福的脸容，生命在到处活跃着。就是这个医院的护士萧玉山，在她手里经过了五六百婴孩。每一次婴儿的降生，都引起她的担心、惊奇和喜悦。但是直到她现在做了母亲，她才体会到一个母亲的幸福和辛苦，她才更体会到一个生命的降生是多么不容易。她有些不好意思地微笑着说：“当那小东西还在肚子里的时候，对他就有多少焦虑、期待和不安！一种责任感降临到我身上，使我常常不由自己地要想起他来：他是个什么样呢？他会平平安安健健壮壮地长成起来吗？他将来会遇到什么？”说到这里，她轻轻舒了口气，“他平安地出生了。我喂着他，眼睛不愿意一刻离开他。奶多了，怕呛了他；奶少了，又怕他吃不饱。我的丈夫一来，也是忙着问什么时候给他种卡介苗，什么时候给他注射预防针，忙着给他操心。一个生命的成长真是不容易呵。”我们从她的孩子的出生谈起，谈到孩子的将来，谈到和平幸福的生活，也谈到了当前的战争威胁。她的心情沉重起来了。她沉默了一会，缓慢有力地说：“我们既然给予了生命，我们一定要保卫生命。世界上没有比一个母亲更能知道一个生命的艰难和宝贵的了。对于我们做母亲的来说，和平就是我们的生命、我们的血肉、我们孩子的幸福的将来！”说到这里，她紧紧地搂着她的孩子说：
    “假如炸弹现在落下来，没问题，我一定用自己的身体盖住他。”
    同样的话，我听到有八个孩子的母亲黄月华也说过，但是她加上了一句：“我有这么多孩子，我抱那个好？”因此，她呼吁千千万万的母亲团结起来“拯救孩子！拯救和平！”她十分关心地注视着正在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。她和她的孩子们热烈地读着和讨论着有关和平会议的消息和文章。
    （二）让“和平”幸福地成长起来！
    “让和平幸福地成长起来”，这是一个新生婴儿“和平”的母亲——一个年轻的部队文艺工作者杨子生的声音。
    我坐在她的床前。松松的辫子垂在她的肩头，她是一个可爱的母亲。她高高兴兴地告诉我：“我生孩子没有感到一点痛苦，我白担了多少心。我的母亲和奶奶告诉我：女人生孩子就是在鬼门关边上走一转。可是我生小孩，因为有了无痛分娩法，简直没有什么痛苦。这都是在和平的时代、毛主席的时代，才有这等幸福。孩子生出来是迎接和平的。”她顿了一下，望着我，有些脸红：“这样，我们就叫他‘和平’。”金色的阳光从大玻璃窗外直泻进来，她活泼地叫着：“多好的天气哪！我常常想，‘和平’，”她温柔地笑了一下，“我的孩子，会像鲜花一样在这样的阳光下成长起来。我想，他将来也许当一名医生，也许当工程师，也许像他父亲一样搞创作，也许像我一样爱演戏。不管怎样，在新中国，孩子一定会走正义的道路，会幸福地成长起来。”
    是的，“和平”将会幸福地成长起来，千千万万新中国的孩子都将幸福地成长起来。这不仅是她，这位年轻的母亲一个人的信念，也是千千万万新中国母亲的信念。她们的声音是温柔的，但是坚决的。
    （三）决不能让帝国主义再来残害我们的孩子
    并不是每个母亲和孩子都有那样的幸福，像萧玉山、杨子生和她们的孩子一样。饱受着战争摧残的中国母亲们，她们还忘不了往日的悲哀。日本帝国主义侵略中国的战争，使中国几百万母亲失去了孩子。这里是其中几位母亲的痛苦、愤怒的声音。这是魏慧明，她的孩子被万恶的日本帝国主义的炸弹炸死了，那炸碎了的小胳膊和小腿，早晚都在她的心里摇晃着。许多孩子是在日寇统治北京的时候吃混合面吃死了的。这里这位常老太太，她生了十个孩子，连饿带冻死了八个孩子。在日寇占领北京的第一年，她就失掉四个孩子。那时候，母亲们从夜里站队站到天亮，买回一点豆饼，还不够孩子们吃。这位周大娘，她的孩子吃得光拉稀，最后瘦得皮包骨头。日寇又来抓闹“虎烈拉”的，看到拉稀的就活活往石灰坑里扔。周大娘惊慌地抱着孩子，从这条胡同躲到那条胡同，跑得两条腿都发肿。亲生的孩子，不能眼看着往石灰坑里埋呀。“孩子总算拉扯大了，可是由于过去的损害，到现在还是骨瘦如柴，老闹着病”。说到这里她哭了起来，在旁的许多母亲陪着落泪。
    没有东西可以衡量母亲失去孩子的悲哀。我走进北京西城一家普通的家庭，这家的母亲正忍受着巨大的苦痛。这位许老太太一共生了十三个孩子，除了很小的一个之外，她亲手带大了十二个孩子，熬过了旧社会艰难的岁月，额上密密的皱纹刻划着她的辛劳。好容易解放了，孩子们工作的工作，学习的学习。等待着老太太的是一个幸福的晚年。不料不久以前，她突然接到她大女婿的来信。女儿被美帝国主义撒布的细菌杀死了。女儿死了还丢下一个五岁的孩子。这对于老太太是个可怕的打击。她没有想到现在会失去她的孩子。她心痛着她的女儿，更疼着失去母亲的小外孙。老太太以前一天忙着家务，很少出去参加集会。她听到孩子们讲反对帝国主义，她老闹不清什么叫帝国主义。现在，她咬着牙颤巍巍地说：“这回我可闹清了什么是帝国主义，那就是叫母亲失去她的孩子，孩子失去母亲的怪东西。我得找它拚命。”我告诉她一个人找它是没有用的。北京正召开一个和平会议，许多国家都派代表来一起开会讨论：怎样制止帝国主义逞凶，怎样使母亲不再被它夺去孩子。老太太听明白了，她连忙点着头，要我告诉代表们：决不能让帝国主义再来夺去我们的孩子。这是悲哀的也是愤怒的母亲的声音。
    （四）我们有力量保卫我们的孩子
    新中国的母亲们，已经站了起来的母亲们不仅有决心、也有力量来保卫自己的孩子。成千成万的母亲把她们的孩子送到了朝鲜前线去为和平而战斗。许多母亲直接走上了捍卫和平、保卫孩子的最前线，吕希炎就是其中的一个。更多的母亲们，在家里活跃在各个战线上。周大娘、常老太太和其他许多家庭妇女都参加了街道的卫生、治安工作。她们巩固了人民民主基层政权。走上生产战线的母亲也愈来愈多了。她们每日每时地在为和平而劳动，为和平事业增添着力量。
    我走进一家工厂的托儿室。在这里，母亲们正在愉快地给自己的孩子喂着奶。“赵玉书，你的挑战条件订得不低呀！”一个青年女工高高兴兴地向着另一个正在低头喂奶的女工高叫着。赵玉书抬起头来，也叫着说：“欢迎你应战呀，张景惠。”我问赵玉书，她的挑战条件是怎样的。她笑着说：“不算高，产量超过定额百分之五十，质量保证百分之百。”
    上班的铃声响了起来。在车间里，我看到赵玉书、张景惠和其他的母亲们都低着头踏着她们的机器，全神贯注着生产。在她们机器前，插着标志着优胜成绩的小红旗。陪着我参观的工会同志告诉我：为了迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，女工们展开了生产竞赛，已经有一个星期了。赵玉书缝裤里，原定一天缝十六个，现在做到二十五个；张景惠缝里面结合，原定一天二十七个，现在做到四十个。
    这是母亲们保卫和平，保卫孩子的最响亮的声音！（附图片）
    “为了保卫她们的孩子，亚洲的妇女将和全世界爱好和平的人们在一起，坚决地保卫和平。……”黄月华的八个孩子聚集在母亲身边听她读宋庆龄先生在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上的报告。冯文岗摄
    萧玉山放下手里的“保卫和平”杂志，抱起她的孩子。她说：“对于我们做母亲的来说，和平就是我们的生命、我们的血肉，我们孩子的幸福的将来。”　（人民日报稿）
