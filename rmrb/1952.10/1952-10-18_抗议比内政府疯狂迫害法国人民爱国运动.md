    Protesting the Bineau Government's Mad Persecution of the Patriotic Movement of the French People
    Recently, the French Bineau government has barbarously thrown the General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, Vice Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Le Léap, and other patriots into prison, and searched many organizations of the French Communist Party and democratic groups, as well as the "l'Humanité" and "Ce Soir" newspaper offices. This is another major crime committed by the Bineau government following the arrest of French Communist Party Secretary Duclos and Central Committee member Stieglitz and others this summer. It can be seen that, under the instructions of the United States, the Bineau government's attack on the French working class and its vanguard, the French Communist Party, and French democratic organizations is becoming increasingly frenzied.
    Le Léap was arrested for engaging in the just actions of supporting the defense of peace and opposing the French reactionary government's colonial war in Vietnam. The crime charged against Le Léap by the Bineau government is "corrupting the public's mind and discouraging morale." However, everyone knows that the French reactionary government's arms expansion and war preparations and the war of aggression against Vietnam are very unpopular. In order to fulfill the "obligation" to establish the "European Army" and conduct colonial wars, the Bineau government has burdened the French people with heavy military expenditures of 1,270 billion francs, accounting for 40 percent of the total budget in 1952-1953; and in the war of aggression against Vietnam, France has lost as many as 220,000 soldiers. The French reactionary government's war policy has taken away the butter and bread from the French people's tables, and taken away the sons of countless French mothers. The French people's struggle to defend peace and oppose colonial wars is shaking the Bineau government's rule. The Bineau government's frantic suppression of the people's patriotic movement reflects the French reactionaries' sinister conspiracy to strengthen their oppression of the people by fascist terror.
    At present, the Bineau government is suffering from a dual political and economic crisis. In order to escape the increasingly serious economic crisis, the Bineau government places great hope on U.S. military orders. However, it is not easy to obtain "U.S. aid." According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on October 9, U.S. officials bluntly stated that any possibility of increasing the French government's military orders to the $650 million it requested depends on "the efforts demonstrated by France itself." This means that if France wants to obtain "U.S. aid," it must step up its "efforts" to sell out national interests and independence. The Bineau government's illegal imprisonment of Le Léap and continued suppression of the French people's patriotic movement are concrete manifestations of this
    "effort".
    The Bineau government's new crimes have aroused the anger of the working class and peace-loving people all over the world. The World Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have sent telegrams to the Bineau government to express their protest. With the support of the world's democratic forces, the French people shattered the Bineau government's conspiracy to persecute Duclos and Stieglitz and others five months ago, and today they will certainly be able to shatter the Bineau government's new conspiracy to persecute Le Léap and suppress the French patriotic movement.

### 抗议比内政府疯狂迫害法国人民爱国运动

    抗议比内政府疯狂迫害法国人民爱国运动
    最近，法国比内政府蛮横地将法国总工会总书记、世界工会联合会副主席勒里普和其他爱国人士投入监狱，并搜查了法国共产党和民主团体的许多组织以及“人道报”和“今晚报”报馆。这是比内政府继今年夏天逮捕法国共产党书记杜克洛以及法共中央委员斯梯等人之后的又一重大罪行。人们可以看到，在美国的指使下，比内政府对法国工人阶级及其先锋队法国共产党和法国民主组织的进攻愈来愈疯狂了。
    勒里普是因为从事支持保卫和平与反对法国反动政府在越南进行的殖民战争的正义行动而被捕的，比内政府加于勒里普的罪名是“败坏民心，沮丧士气”。然而，谁都知道，法国反动政府进行的扩军备战运动和侵略越南的战争是十分不得人心的。为了履行建立“欧洲军”的“义务”和进行殖民战争，比内政府已使法国人民在一九五二—一九五三年度负担占全部预算百分之四十、数达一万二千七百亿法郎的沉重军费；而在侵略越南战争中，法国已损兵折将达二十二万人之多。法国反动政府的战争政策已夺去了法国人民餐桌上的牛油和面包，夺去了无数法国母亲的儿子。法国人民保卫和平与反对殖民战争的斗争，撼动着比内政府的统治。比内政府疯狂镇压人民的爱国运动，反映了法国反动派企图以法西斯恐怖手段来加强对人民的压制的罪恶阴谋。
    目前比内政府正遭受着政治的和经济的双重危机。为了逃脱日益严重的经济危机，比内政府把极大的希望寄托于美国的军事订货上，然而，要获得“美援”并不是容易的事。据十月九日合众社华盛顿电讯透露：美国官员曾露骨地说，要将法国政府军事订货增到它所要求的六亿五千万美元的任何可能性，都要取决于“法国本身所表现的努力”。这就是说，法国要想获得“美援”，就必须加紧出卖民族利益和独立的“努力”。比内政府非法监禁勒里普，继续镇压法国人民的爱国运动，正是这种
    “努力”的具体表现。
    比内政府的新罪行已引起全世界工人阶级与爱好和平的人民的愤怒。世界工会联合会与我全国总工会都致电比内政府表示抗议。在世界民主力量的支持下，法国人民曾于五个月以前粉碎了比内政府迫害杜克洛和斯梯等人的阴谋，今天也一定能够粉碎比内政府迫害勒里普、镇压法国爱国运动的新阴谋。
