    Premier Zhou Enlai delivered the following speech at the banquet: Representatives, Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades:

    The Tibetan Delegation and delegations from all fraternal nationalities across the country have come to the capital for the great National Day, once again demonstrating the increasing consolidation and strengthening of the cause of unity of all nationalities in our People's Republic of China! (Warm applause) On behalf of the State Council of the Central People's Government, I extend a warm welcome to all the representatives of the Tibetan Delegation and the delegations of various nationalities! (Applause)

    Representatives, Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades: Since the founding of our People's Republic of China three years ago, under the leadership of the great leader of all nationalities, Chairman Mao, we have achieved brilliant achievements in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, and national defense construction. Our country has become a strong and prosperous country. Every nationality living in this increasingly strong and prosperous great family of the motherland has a bright and splendid future! (Prolonged applause)

    We all know that the ethnic policy formulated by Chairman Mao, the leader of all nationalities, has laid an indestructible foundation for the cause of unity among all nationalities in our country. On this basis, in order to concretely realize Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, the Central People's Government promulgated the historically significant "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China" in August this year. At the same time, the State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Decision on the Implementation of Measures for Local National Democratic United Governments" and the "Decision on Guaranteeing the Equal Rights of All Scattered Minorities to Enjoy National Equality." The promulgation of these three documents has been warmly supported by the people of all nationalities throughout the country. There is no doubt that the promulgation of these three documents has great historical significance for the development of all fraternal nationalities in our country and the further consolidation of the cause of unity among all nationalities. (Warm applause)

    However, we must never be complacent in the slightest. We should continue to work hard to implement Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, conscientiously and universally promote the policy of national regional autonomy and the system of national democratic united governments, conscientiously and universally guarantee the equal rights of scattered minority peoples, more systematically cultivate a large number of ethnic cadres who are connected to the people of their own nationalities, more effectively develop trade, health, education, and other economic and cultural undertakings in minority areas, and pay more attention to educating the broad masses of people to respect the religious beliefs and customs of minority nationalities. Here, I need to particularly point out that, proceeding from their ambition to invade and plunder, imperialists always try every possible means to provoke relations between the various nationalities in our country. The people of all nationalities in our country, especially the leaders of all fraternal nationalities, must always be vigilant, strictly guard against all the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism, universally and deeply carry out patriotic education, and strive for the further consolidation and strengthening of the cause of unity of all nationalities in our country! (Prolonged applause)

    Finally, let us

    Cheer for the health of Chairman Mao, the great leader of all nationalities in our country! (Prolonged and warm applause, everyone stands up)

    Cheer for the increasingly strong unity and development of all nationalities in our country! (Prolonged applause)

    The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. Attendees frequently toasted to Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people of all nationalities, and to the close unity of all nationalities in China.

    西藏致敬团和全国各兄弟民族代表团于伟大的国庆节来到首都，又一次显示了我们中华人民共和国各民族团结事业的日益巩固和加强。（热烈鼓掌）我代表中央人民政府政务院向西藏致敬团和各民族代表团的全体代表们致以热烈的欢迎。（鼓掌）
    代表们，先生们，同志们：我们中华人民共和国成立三年以来，在各民族人民伟大的领袖毛主席的领导下，无论在政治、经济、文化、国防建设的各方面，都获得了辉煌的成就。我们的国家已成为强大和繁荣的国家。生活在这个日益强大和繁荣的祖国大家庭中的每一个民族，都有着光明灿烂的发展前途。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们大家都知道，我们各民族人民的领袖毛主席所规定的民族政策，为我国各族人民的团结事业奠定了牢不可破的基础。在此基础上，为了具体地实现毛主席的民族政策，中央人民政府在今年八月颁布了有历史意义的“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”，中央人民政府政务院同时公布了“关于地方民族民主联合政府实施办法的决定”和“关于保障一切散居的少数民族成分享有民族平等权利的决定”，这三个文件的公布，受到全国各民族人民的热烈拥护。毫无疑义，这三个文件的公布对于我国各兄弟民族的发展和各民族人民团结事业进一步的巩固，有着重大的历史意义。（热烈鼓掌）
    但是，我们绝不应该有丝毫的满足，我们应当继续努力地贯彻毛主席的民族政策，认真普遍地推行民族区域自治政策及民族民主联合政府的制度，认真普遍地保障散居的少数民族人民的平等权利，更有计划地大量培养与本民族人民有联系的民族干部，更有效地发展少数民族地区的贸易、卫生、教育及其他经济文化事业，更加注意教育广大人民尊重少数民族的宗教信仰及风俗习惯。在这里我需要特别指出，帝国主义从其略侵的野心出发，总是要千方百计地来挑拨我国各民族间的关系的，我国各民族人民特别是各兄弟民族的领袖人物，必须经常保持警惕，严防帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计，普遍深入地进行爱国主义教育，为我国各民族团结事业的进一步的巩固和加强而奋斗。（经久不息的掌声）
    最后，让我们
    为我国各民族人民伟大的领袖毛主席的健康而欢呼！（经久不息的热烈的掌声，全体起立）
    为我国各民族日益强大的团结和发展而欢呼！（经久不息的掌声）
    宴会在热烈友爱的空气中进行。赴宴者频频为中国各族人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席而干杯，为中国各民族的亲密团结而干杯。
