People in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Tianjin, and other places commemorated the 16th anniversary of Lu Xun's death.

The preparatory committee of the East China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles jointly held a memorial symposium on the evening of the 18th. Xia Yan pointed out at the meeting: The 16th anniversary of Lu Xun's death is being commemorated after the victory of the rectification of literature and art and ideological remolding, and therefore has a special and profound significance. Throughout his life, Mr. Lu Xun not only waged an indomitable and tenacious struggle against the revolutionary enemies and their running dogs and lackeys, but also frequently put forward sharp criticisms against the erroneous ideas and styles of work within the progressive literary and art circles. Xia Yan called on the entire East China literary and art circles to further study Mr. Lu Xun's glorious and combative realistic spirit throughout his life, and to further advance the work of literature and art. On the morning of the 19th, Xia Yan, Lai Shaoqi, Peng Boshan, Xiong Foxi, Wei Jinzhi and more than 20 other people went to Lu Xun's tomb to pay their respects and presented wreaths. On the same day, Shanghai's Jiefang Daily, Ta Kung Pao, Xinwen Daily, and Wenhui Bao all published the People's Daily editorial entitled "Inherit Lu Xun's Revolutionary Patriotism Spiritual Legacy" and commemorative articles. The Ta Kung Pao also published an editorial, hoping that Shanghai literary and art workers can systematically and extensively study and research Mr. Lu Xun's works, so that Mr. Lu Xun's thoughts and spirit can be further developed and inspire us to move forward. On the 19th, people flocked to visit and pay tribute to Lu Xun's former residence—the Lu Xun Memorial Hall, and they all expressed their great respect for this most outstanding cultural warrior in China.

More than 700 literary and art workers, educators, and young people who love literature and art in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City gathered on the evening of the 18th to commemorate the 16th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death.

Shaoxing City, the hometown of Mr. Lu Xun, held a memorial meeting on the morning of the 19th, with the participation of 1,000 representatives from the city's cultural and educational circles and young people. The former residence of Lu Xun in Xintai Gate, Shaoxing City, has been renovated by the Shaoxing Municipal People's Government into the Lu Xun Memorial Hall, which was officially opened on the same day, and people from all walks of life flocked to visit.

More than 1,000 people from Tianjin's cultural and educational circles held a memorial meeting for the 16th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death on the afternoon of the 18th. Mr. Lu Xun's younger brother, biologist Zhou Jianren, reported on Mr. Lu Xun's life at the meeting.
