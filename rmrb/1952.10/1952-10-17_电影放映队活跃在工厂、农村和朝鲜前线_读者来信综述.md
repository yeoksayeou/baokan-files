    Movie Projection Teams Active in Factories, Rural Areas, and on the Korean Front
    ——Reader Letters Summary
    Currently, our country has 1,800 movie projection teams, many of which are active in factories and vast rural areas, and some on the Korean front. Recently, we received letters from readers reflecting the activities of movie teams in various locations and their popularity among the masses, as well as the profound education that movies provide to the masses.
    Lin Huairu from the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions wrote that when the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions' projection team went to Yaotou Town in the Northwest to screen movies for coal miners and kiln workers, they were warmly welcomed by the workers. The workers here had never seen a movie before. When they heard that the movie team was coming, they greeted this happy event with practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy. On the night the movie team arrived, it was raining, but the workers were in high spirits and watched the entire film in the rain. When the projection team screened movies in Hancheng County, there were more than 3,000 viewers on the first night, and 6,500 viewers on the second night. When the projection team arrived at Xizhuang Town in the Huanglong Mountain area, the masses from nearby villages came from all directions, some traveling dozens of miles in carts, riding donkeys, riding oxen, helping the old and carrying the young. Some people were blind, and some were deaf, but they also came, wanting to hear and see the movies. An eighty-year-old woman who was paralyzed also came, carried on someone's back. She said: "Before liberation, I had never heard of what a movie was. After liberation, I heard people say that movies are very good. Now Chairman Mao has sent a movie team, and even though I am paralyzed, I want to see it. I never thought that I, an old woman who has suffered all my life, could see a movie today. I have truly not lived eighty years in vain."
    Wang Changfa from the Lingchuan County People's Culture Center in Shanxi Province wrote that the movie projection team of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Culture and Education went deep into the most remote areas of the Taihang Mountains to screen films for the masses. The movie team also went to the most remote mountain villages in Lingchuan County, such as Gujiao and Siyi. The masses warmly welcomed the arrival of the movie team, celebrating it as their own festival. When the movie team moved from one village to another, the masses spontaneously beat gongs and drums to see them off, and the masses in the next village greeted them on the way. Now 50% of the masses in Lingchuan County have seen movies and have been educated in patriotism and internationalism. They said: "Movies are really good. If it weren't for Chairman Mao, people in our mountain villages would never see movies for generations."
    Zhang Zhang from the Dongguang branch of the People's Insurance Company of China wrote that after the movie team screened "A Daughter's Marriage" in the countryside, the masses gained a deeper understanding of the benefits of marriage autonomy, and many parents changed their feudal ideas of arranging their children's marriages. The masses believe: "The education received from watching a movie once is more rewarding than holding a dozen meetings."
    Li Jian'an, a soldier from the Yuci Military Sub-district of the Shanxi Military Region, wrote that after watching "A Daughter's Marriage" in Yuci recently, he heard the masses reflect that the village often talked about marriage policies, mutual aid, and cooperation, but everyone always felt that the old rules were good, thinking that being in love was shameful, and that mutual aid was not as good as working alone, fearing that others would not work wholeheartedly when working for them and would ruin their crops. After watching the movie, everyone's mental blocks were cleared.
    Wang Chaoting, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, described the situation of watching movies on the Korean front. The unit's movie projection team came to a place very close to the front line to screen movies for the soldiers. There were no cinemas there, nor a spacious house, so they watched in the open field. Because it was in combat conditions, when showing movies, they had to be vigilant against air raids at all times. When enemy planes came, the lights were turned off, and when the enemy planes left, they continued to show the film. The soldiers were all happy to be able to see movies on the battlefield, and their fighting spirit was even higher.
    The masses love movies so much and have received profound education, and these achievements are inseparable from the hard work of the comrades of the movie projection teams. They climbed mountains and waded through rivers, overcoming various difficulties, and bringing movies to the masses. Their footprints have traveled all over the mountains and plains. Leng Jiaowu from the Liaodong Film Projection Team wrote that the Liaodong Province Film Projection Headquarters organized ten projection teams in May this year and two more projection teams in June to go to the countryside to screen films for farmers on tour. They traveled from the high mountains and steep ridges of Changbai Mountain in northern Liaoning to the islands and plains of southern Liaoning. In more than two months, they overcame many difficulties and screened more than 480 movies, which were seen by more than 1.16 million people. Ji Pu from the Shandong Provincial Department of Culture and Education Film Projection Team reflected: The movie projectionists are working with great enthusiasm. They carry their luggage and carry the machines with the laborers, climbing mountains and crossing ridges, and going deep into the countryside. The fourth team of the Shandong Provincial Department of Culture and Education Film Projection Team once went to two places in one night and screened two movies. In one day, they walked 35 miles from Yancun in Dongguang County to Shuangshi Zhaocun in Nanpi County to screen a movie for the masses. On the same night, they walked more than ten miles in the dark to screen another movie for the masses in the Chengguan District, which was not finished until four o'clock in the morning. The masses were deeply moved by their working spirit. The enthusiasm of the masses also greatly inspired their working mood.

    电影放映队活跃在工厂、农村和朝鲜前线
    ——读者来信综述
    现在我国有一千八百个电影放映队，有许多放映队是活动在工厂和广大农村的，有的活动在朝鲜前线。最近我们收到一些读者来信，反映电影队在各地的活动及受群众欢迎的情形，以及电影对群众所进行的深刻教育。西北总工会蔺怀儒来信说，西北总工会的放映队，到西北窑头镇给煤矿工人、窑业工人放映电影时，受到了工人们的热烈欢迎。这里的工人们过去从来没有看过电影，他们听说电影队要来，便以增产节约的实际行动来迎接这件喜事。电影队到达的当天晚上，天下着雨，但工人们情绪很高，在雨地里一直把影片看完。该放映队在韩城县放映电影时，第一天晚上观众三千多人，第二天晚上就有观众六千五百多人。当放映队到黄龙山区的西庄镇时，邻近各村的群众从四面八方赶来，有的从几十里地外套上大车，骑着驴，骑着牛，扶老携幼赶来了。有的人眼睛瞎了，耳朵聋了，但也赶来，要听听和看看电影。有个八十多岁的老太婆是个瘫子，让人背着也来了。她说：“解放前我没有听说过电影是什么，解放后听人说电影好得很，现在毛主席派电影队来了，我虽是瘫子也要看看。想不到我这受过一辈子苦的老婆子，今天也能看到电影了。我真不白活八十多岁了。”
    山西陵川县人民文化馆王长发来信说，山西省文教厅的电影放映队，深入太行山区最偏僻的地方给群众放映影片。像陵川县最偏僻的山沟小村庄：古郊、四义等，电影队也去了。群众热烈欢迎电影队的到来，把它作为自己的节日来庆祝。电影队从这村往别村走时，群众自动敲锣打鼓欢送，他村的群众又在半路上迎接。现在陵川县已有百分之五十的群众看到了电影，受到了爱国主义和国际主义的教育。他们说：“电影实在好。要不是毛主席，咱们山沟里的人，祖祖辈辈也看不到电影。”
    中国人民保险公司东光支公司张彰来信说：电影队下乡放映“儿女亲事”后，群众比较深刻地认识了婚姻自主的好处，许多父母改变了包办儿女亲事的封建思想。群众认为：“看一次电影受的教育比开十几次会收获还大。”
    山西军区榆次军分区的战士李建安来信说，最近他在榆次看了“儿女亲事”后，听到群众反映：村里时常讲婚姻政策，互助、合作，但大家总觉得旧规矩好，以为恋爱是丢人的事，互助不如单干好，怕别人给自己干活时不用心干，把自己的庄稼干坏了。看完影片后，大家脑子里的疙瘩才解开了。
    人民志愿军战士王朝廷来信叙述了他们在朝鲜前线看电影的情形。部队的电影放映队来到距前沿阵地很近的地方给战士们放映电影。那里既没有电影院，也没有一间宽阔的房子，他们就在旷野地里看。因为是在战斗的情况下，放映影片时，还要时时提防空袭，提高警惕。敌人的飞机一来，灯光便熄了，敌机走了又接着放映起来。战士们都为自己能在战地里看到影片而高兴，战斗的情绪更提高了。
    群众这样热爱电影，受到了深刻教育，这些成绩是和电影放映队的同志们的艰苦努力分不开的。他们爬山涉水，克服种种困难，把电影送到群众中去，他们的足迹是走遍高山和平原的。辽东电影放映队冷教武来信说，辽东省电影放映总队在今年五月曾组织十个放映队，六月又组织两个放映队下乡给农民巡回放映影片。他们从辽北长白山的高山峻岭，走到辽南的海岛和平原。在两个多月内，战胜了许多困难，放映了电影四百八十多场，有一百一十六万群众看到了影片。山东省文教厅电影放映队汲甫来信反映：电影放映员们以高度的热情工作着，他们背着行李，并和民工们一道抬着机器，翻山越岭，深入农村。山东省文教厅电影放映队第四小队，曾在一天晚上，走两个地方，放两场电影。他们在一天内，从东光县燕村走三十五里路到南皮县双狮赵村给群众放映一场影片后，在当天晚上，摸黑走了十几里路给城关区的群众又放映了一场，直到夜里四点钟才放完。群众深深为他们的工作精神所感动。群众的热情也大大鼓舞了他们的工作情绪。
