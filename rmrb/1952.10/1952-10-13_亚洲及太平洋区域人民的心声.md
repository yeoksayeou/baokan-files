    The Voice of the People of Asia and the Pacific Region
    Yuan Shuipai
    For many years, the lands along the Asian and Pacific coasts have echoed with the whips of colonial masters; for many generations, the waves of the Pacific have been traversed by the merchant ships and warships of plunderers. How many nations could not swallow the tears of slaves, how many nations could not taste the sweetness of independence and autonomy, how many nations could not escape the misfortune of war, how many nations could not obtain peace and tranquility. Fresh blood has congealed into the flowers of liberation, China has opened the iron shackles of the East, Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya are heroic sisters, and the light of victory illuminates the road of Asia. Awakened people offer each other flowers. A firm oath - never to kill each other. "Do not be cannon fodder for the imperialists!" is their resounding answer to the war instigators. We do not want ignorance and famine, we do not want slavery and death. The friendship between us
    The ocean cannot stop it, passports cannot block it! The unity between us
    No violence or slander can damage it!

    亚洲及太平洋区域人民的心声
    袁水拍多少年来，亚洲和太平洋沿岸土地上响着殖民地主人的皮鞭；多少世代，太平洋的波浪上横行着掠夺者的商船兵舰。多少民族咽不尽奴隶的眼泪，多少民族尝不到独立自主的甜味，多少民族摆不脱战争的厄运，多少民族得不到和平与安生。鲜血凝成了解放的花朵，中国打开了东方的铁锁，朝鲜、越南、马来亚是英勇的姊妹，胜利的光芒照亮了亚洲的道路。觉醒了的人民彼此献着鲜花。坚决的誓言——永不互相残杀。“不给帝国主义者当炮灰！”是他们给战争挑拨者的响亮回答。我们不要愚昧和饥荒，我们不要奴役和死亡。我们之间的友好
    海洋不能拦，护照不能挡！我们之间的团结
    任何暴力和诬蔑都不能损伤！
