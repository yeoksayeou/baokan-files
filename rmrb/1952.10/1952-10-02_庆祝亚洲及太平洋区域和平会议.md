    World Peace Council Chairman Joliot-Curie's Message of Greetings
    Dear friends, we all deeply understand the importance of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. This is a historic event. Because, for the first time, representatives of the people from this decisive region of the world are meeting and discussing issues related to their own security, their prosperity, and their future.
    Saving peace in Asia, that is the task you need to undertake.
    Saving peace in Asia means saving the lives of hundreds of millions of men and women, because it was in Asia that the atomic bomb was dropped in 1945—a weapon of blind mass destruction that destroyed entire cities and their inhabitants.
    Also, it is in Asia, in Korea, and on Chinese territory that the most brutal war is being waged, with barbaric air raids, napalm bombs, and bacteriological weapons.
    If we can make everyone understand how this war is being waged, we can urge all the people of the world to stop this war and prevent it from continuing and expanding.
    I am convinced that your conference will help consolidate peace throughout the world and will play a powerful role in preparing for the World People's Peace Congress.
    Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council
    Message of Greetings from Pietro Nenni,
    Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council and
    Chairman of the Italian National Peace Council
    To Comrade Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace:
    Unable to come to Beijing, I send this telegram to congratulate the Asian Peace Conference. I especially extend brotherly greetings to the heroic Korean people and their delegation.
    Long live the People's China!
    Long live the Asian peace movement!
    Pietro Nenni
    Message of Greetings from Louis Saillant,
    General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions
    The World Federation of Trade Unions, representing its 80 million members and all working people of independent trade unions of different political and religious beliefs and different races, extends warm greetings to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The WFTU expresses its full support for the peoples of the Asian and Pacific region, whose struggle for peace is inseparable from the struggle of the working people for independence and improved living conditions.
    The WFTU, together with the peoples of the Asian and Pacific region, demands: an end to the arms race and war preparations; a ban on the use of bacteriological, atomic, and chemical weapons; an end to the bombing and crimes against peaceful residents; a ban on war propaganda and the incitement of racial hatred; respect for international law; an end to the remilitarization of Japan; and a peaceful settlement of the Korean question on a fair basis.
    The WFTU believes that the united action of the broad masses of the people is a guarantee of victory in the struggle against the reactionaries and instigators of new wars. The WFTU is convinced that the conference will be an important contribution to the cause of uniting the forces of peace. We wish the conference brilliant success.
    Long live the unity of the working people!
    Long live the friendship of the peoples of all countries in defending world peace!

    Message of Greetings from the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace
    To the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference:
    On the occasion of the victorious convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, the peace-loving Chinese people extend their heartfelt congratulations and respect to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference and to all the representatives attending the Peace Conference.
    The convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is a new victory for the 1.6 billion people of the Asian and Pacific region in uniting to safeguard peace in the East and the world. It will promote the replacement of violence with the spirit of consultation, the replacement of blockade with equality and mutual benefit, and the replacement of enslavement with national friendship. It is a great encouragement to the people of Asia, the Pacific, and the world who are striving for independence, freedom, and peace.
    Please allow us to wish in advance that the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, representing the deep aspirations of the peace-loving people of Asian and Pacific countries, will achieve glorious victories and achievements in the great cause of further strengthening and developing the Asian and Pacific regional peace movement and the world peace movement.

    Message of Greetings from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    To all the representatives of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference:
    We feel very honored that the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is being held in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China. We express our infinite respect to the representatives of various countries who have come to participate in the conference at the risk of hardship for the noble cause of defending peace.
    At present, US imperialism is frantically pursuing a policy of aggression and war in the Asian and Pacific region. US imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, occupied our territory—Taiwan, violated the Potsdam Proclamation, and unilaterally signed a separate peace treaty with the Yoshida government, stepping up the revival of Japanese militarism and turning Japan into a forward base for aggression against China and Asia, delaying and obstructing the Korean armistice negotiations, and carrying out inhuman bacteriological warfare on the land of Korea and China. This series of aggressive acts by US imperialism has seriously threatened the security and peace of the countries in the Asian and Pacific region. Therefore, convening the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference has become a universal and urgent demand of the people of the countries in this region.
    The declaration of the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference held in June this year pointed out: "If the people of the countries in the Asian and Pacific region take concerted action for peace, they will be able to change this situation, end all existing and potential conflicts in Asia, and repel the threat of war." We firmly believe that the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference will surely be able to make great achievements in this regard.
    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the working class of the whole country, expresses its warm congratulations on the opening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference and wishes the conference a victorious success!

    Message of Greetings from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation
    Dear representatives of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference:
    First of all, please allow us to extend our warm welcome and high respect to you—the peace representatives of the people and women of all countries—on behalf of the women of China! We feel that it is the supreme glory of the Chinese people that the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, which will make a significant contribution to the cause of peace in Asia, the Pacific region, and the world, can be held in Beijing, the capital of our country.
    We Chinese women have long experienced the pain of war and know from personal experience that peace is the most precious thing. Only in a peaceful environment can women's rights be guaranteed and children's happiness protected. Therefore, we have always loved peace, strived for peace, and opposed war. We deeply sympathize with the women of all countries in the Asian and Pacific region who are being threatened by wars of aggression. We are willing to be with them, unite closely, and make unremitting efforts to defend peace and stop war.
    We firmly believe that through this conference, all peace-loving women and men in the Asian and Pacific region will be further mobilized and more widely united to become more active in stopping war and defending peace. We also believe that as long as the people of all countries bravely shoulder the cause of maintaining peace, peace can certainly be maintained and consolidated. We wish the conference a victorious success with full confidence!

We firmly believe that the victorious convening of this conference will make a great contribution to safeguarding peace in Asia, the Pacific region, and the world. We Chinese youth will always unite with the peace-loving people of Asia, the Pacific region, and the world to fight for the defense of peace. We wish the conference success and wish all representatives good health.

    Message of Greetings from the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth
    To the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference:
    The convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference marks the unity, friendship, and common determination to defend peace among the people of the Asian and Pacific region. We firmly believe that the conference will powerfully strike at the conspiracies of all war instigators and greatly promote the cause of defending peace in Asia, the Pacific region, and the world. The Chinese youth have consistently worked actively for the cause of peace, express their warm support for the convening of the conference, and are determined to strive for the realization of the conference's resolutions. We wish the conference success and wish all representatives good health.
    All-China Federation of Democratic Youth
    October 1, 1952
    Message of Greetings from the All-China Students' Federation
    To the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference:
    The All-China Students' Federation, on behalf of Chinese students, warmly congratulates the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference on its victorious opening in Beijing, the capital of our country.
    The convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is of great significance at a time when peace and security in the Asian and Pacific region are seriously threatened. We firmly believe that with the joint efforts of the 1.6 billion people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific region, the peace movement in the Asian and Pacific region will surely achieve significant development, and the conspiracies of all war instigators will ultimately fail.
    Chinese students are determined to join hands closely with the people and students of various countries in the Asian and Pacific region to jointly fight for the defense of peace!
    We wish the conference brilliant success.

    Message of Greetings from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    To the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference:
    The victorious convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference has great historical significance. It symbolizes the great unity of peace-loving forces in Asian and Pacific countries. The selection of Beijing as the venue for the conference has a very profound meaning: this is not only because the Chinese people are standing side by side with the Korean people on the forefront of the struggle against aggression and for the defense of peace, but also because the People's Republic of China is a peaceful country, which is carrying out large-scale peaceful construction under the leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. The power of the peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union is constantly increasing. The brilliant victories achieved by the great Soviet people and the Chinese people in peaceful construction have more powerfully strengthened the determination and belief of the people of all countries in the world to oppose aggression and defend peace. The 38 million members of the Association extend their respects to the representatives of all countries attending this conference, especially to those representatives who have overcome all obstacles to attend; and with excitement, we warmly wish the conference success.

    庆祝亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    世界和平理事会主席约里奥——居里的贺电
    亲爱的朋友们，我们大家都深知亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的重要性。这是一件具有历史意义的大事。因为，这个在世界上具有决定性的地区的人民代表，第一次互相会面和讨论与他们本身的安全、他们的繁荣、以及他们的前途有关的问题。
    拯救亚洲和平，这就是你们所需要负担起来的任务。
    拯救亚洲的和平，就是拯救亿万男女生命，因为，就是在亚洲，一九四五年投下了原子弹——这个盲目的大规模毁灭整个城市和居民的武器。
    同时也就是在亚洲，在朝鲜，并且在中国领土上，使用野蛮的空袭、凝固汽油弹和细菌武器进行最残酷的战争。
    如果我们能够令所有人明白这战争是在怎样进行着，我们就可以促使全世界人民阻止这个战争使其无法继续和扩大。
    我深信你们的会议一定有助于全世界和平的巩固，对于世界人民和平大会的准备工作一定会起强有力的作用。
    世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里

    世界工联认为：在与反动派和新战争挑拨者进行斗争时，广大人民的一致行动是胜利的保证。世界工联坚信大会对于团结和平力量的事业将是一个重要的贡献。谨祝大会获得辉煌的成就。

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议：
    值此亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议胜利召开之际，爱好和平的中国人民谨向亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议、向出席和平会议的全体代表先生，致以衷心的祝贺和敬意。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，是亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民为维护东方及世界和平而团结的新的胜利。它将促进以协商精神代替暴力，以平等互利代替封锁，以民族友好代替奴役。它对争取独立、自由与和平的亚洲、太平洋以及全世界人民是极大的鼓舞。
    请让我们预祝，代表亚洲及太平洋各国爱好和平人民的深切愿望的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，在为进一步加强与发展亚洲及太平洋区域和平运动和世界和平运动的伟大事业中，获致光辉的胜利与成就。

    中华全国总工会的贺电
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议全体代表们：
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，在中华人民共和国的首都——北京召开，我们感到非常的荣幸。对于各国代表们，为着保卫和平的崇高事业，不辞艰险地前来参加会议，我们表示无限的敬意。
    目前，美帝国主义正在亚洲及太平洋区域疯狂地推行侵略和战争政策。美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，侵占了我国的领土——台湾，违反波茨坦公告，擅自与吉田政府签订片面的对日和约，加紧复活日本军国主义并变日本为侵略中国及亚洲的前哨基地，拖延和阻挠朝鲜的停战谈判，在朝鲜和中国的土地上进行灭绝人性的细菌战争。美帝国主义这一连串的侵略行为，使亚洲及太平洋区域各国的安全与和平遭受到严重的威胁。因此，召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，已经成为本区域各国人民普遍而迫切的要求。
    在今年六月召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备会议宣言中，曾经指出：“亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民为了和平而采取一致行动，就能够改变这种情势，就能够结束亚洲一切现存的和潜伏的冲突，并打退战争的威胁。”我们坚信：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在这方面一定能够作出巨大的成就。
    中华全国总工会代表全国工人阶级对于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的开幕，表示热烈的祝贺，并预祝会议的胜利成功！

    我们中国妇女，长期经历了战争的痛苦，从亲身体验中懂得和平是最可宝贵的，只有在和平的环境里，才能保障妇女权利，才能保卫儿童的幸福。因此，我们一贯热爱和平，争取和平，反对战争。我们对于正在蒙受侵略战争威胁的亚洲及太平洋区域的各国妇女深表同情，我们愿意和她们在一起，亲密地团结起来，为保卫和平制止战争而不懈地努力。
    我们深信，经过这次会议，一定能更进一步地动员和更广泛地团结亚洲及太平洋区域一切爱好和平的妇女和男子，更加积极起来，制止战争，保卫和平。我们也相信只要各国人民把维持和平的事业勇敢地担负起来，和平是一定能够保持和巩固的。我们满怀信心地预祝会议胜利成功！

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议：
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的胜利召开有着重大的历史意义。它象征着亚洲及太平洋各国爱好和平力量的大团结。会议选定在北京举行，具有极其深长的意义：这不仅因为中国人民正与朝鲜人民并肩地站在反对侵略和保卫和平斗争的最前线，同时，更是因为中华人民共和国是一个和平的国度，它正在中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，进行着规模巨大的和平建设。以伟大的苏联为首的和平民主阵营的威力正在不断地增强着，伟大的苏联人民和中国人民在和平建设中所获得的辉煌胜利，更加有力地坚定了全世界各国人民反对侵略与保卫和平的决心和信念。本会三千八百余万会员谨向出席这次会议的各国代表致敬，特别是向那些曾经冲破一切阻障前来出席的代表们致敬；并满怀兴奋的心情热烈地预祝会议的成功。
