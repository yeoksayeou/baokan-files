    New Cotton-Padded Clothes Arrive at the Korean Front
    To the worker comrades of all clothing factories in the motherland: We have received the new cotton-padded clothes you sewed this year. As soon as we saw the clothes, we thought of you. This year's clothes are sewn so well. Look, there is an extra layer of cloth on the shoulders, knees, and back crotch, sewn tightly. Feeling in the pockets, there are needles, thread, patching cloth, and a letter of appreciation. Dear comrades, you have thought of everything so thoroughly. We remember last winter, wearing the cotton-padded clothes sent to us by the people of the motherland, crossing high mountains and passing through forests. The clothes were scratched by thorns and branches, making squeaking sounds, but they were so sturdy and not easily torn. We didn't expect this year's cotton-padded clothes to be even sturdier than last year's, truly getting stronger year by year.
    After receiving the new cotton-padded clothes, each of our squads held a discussion. The comrades all expressed that they would use new victories to respond to your love for us. Everyone also talked about cherishing the motherland's resources and saving wealth for the people. Some comrades wrapped the new clothes in old clothes, and some cut the sleeves of old clothes to put over the new sleeves, cherishing the new cotton-padded clothes as they would cherish weapons.
    All the comrades of the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army

    新棉衣到了朝鲜前线
    祖国各被服厂的工人同志们：今年你们缝的新棉衣，我们收到了。我们一看到衣服就想起了你们。今年的衣服缝得那么好。你看，肩上、膝盖上和后裆上，都加上了一层布，缝得密密的。摸摸口袋里，有针、有线、有补衣布，还有慰问信。亲爱的同志们，你们想得真周到。记得去年冬天我们穿着祖国人民送给我们的棉衣，越过高山，穿过树林，衣服被荆棘和树枝刮得吱吱发响，但它是那么结实，不容易破烂。没想到今年的棉衣，比去年缝得还要结实，真是一年比一年更强。
    收到新棉衣后，我们每个班都开了座谈会，同志们都表示要用新的胜利来回答你们对我们的热爱。大家还谈到了要爱护祖国物资，给人民节省财富。有的同志用旧衣把新衣服包起来，有的把旧衣的袖子剪下来套在新的袖子上，像爱护武器一样爱护着新棉衣。
    志愿军某部五连全体同志
