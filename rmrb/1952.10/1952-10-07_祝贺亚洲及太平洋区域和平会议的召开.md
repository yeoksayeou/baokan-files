Editorial Note: In recent days, people in the capital and across the country have been writing to this newspaper to congratulate the opening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. These letters fully express the Chinese people's love of peace and their determination to defend peace, expressing the common aspirations between the Chinese people and the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, as well as the Chinese people's high respect for the representatives of various countries who are bravely fighting for peace. Now, a selection of letters is published below:

    Liberation Army Soldiers Determined to Defend Peace

    Editor: I am a naval soldier of the People's Liberation Army. I warmly congratulate the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference on its opening in our capital.

    Thinking of the long eight years when Japanese militarists trampled on our country—the robbers used cruel means such as the "Three Alls Policy" and "strengthening public security" to slaughter the innocent Chinese people, turning many beautiful cities and villages into ruins, and leaving millions of peaceful residents in hunger, cold, displacement, and even death, my heart aches. I also think of my father—a hardworking and honest farmer—how he died in those days.

    Eight years ago, my home was next to a small station on the Shide Railway. During a "mopping-up" operation by the "Japanese Imperial Army," my father was captured by the devils. The beasts stabbed him three times in the abdomen without asking a word, and then shot him in the head. My father died innocently like that. I was very young then, what could I do! I could only bury the hatred deeply in my young heart.

    Now, I have grown up. Under the education of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, I have become a revolutionary soldier. Now I hold a gun tightly in my hand. I guard the motherland's coast and borders, guarding the happiness of all the Chinese people. You say, can I let the US imperialism revive Japanese militarism to invade our country again? Of course not! I want to assure the representatives of all countries attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference: the people's soldiers of our New China have the confidence and strength to defend the peace of the Far East and the world.
                                                     Soldier of the Guard Battalion of the Naval Artillery School Zhao Yaohua

    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Launches Production Competition to Celebrate Peace Conference

    Editor: All the workers of our Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant are extremely excited to congratulate the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference on its opening in our country's capital.

    The war mongers headed by US imperialism, disregarding the opposition of the people of the world, are destroying international conventions, plotting to revive German fascism and arm Japanese militarism, threatening the peaceful lives of the people of all countries.

    The workers of our Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have personally suffered the cruel oppression of the Japanese invaders. At that time, we ate bitter and smelly black bean noodles with hairs, and wore clothes made of cement bag paper. We deeply know that the imperialist invaders are inhumane.

    In the more than three years of peaceful construction in our plant, we have made significant achievements in production. A certain furnace exceeded the highest output during the Japanese puppet regime by 270%; with the help of Soviet experts, we repaired the iron-smelting furnace that the Kuomintang reactionaries wanted to sell as scrap iron. With the development of production, the living welfare of our workers has also been greatly improved. Now the workers eat rice and white flour, and everyone has two or three sets of new clothes. More than 70% of the workers ride brand new bicycles. We have our own hospitals, clubs, spare-time schools and libraries. We can watch free movies three times a week, and a new sanatorium is under construction.

    It is precisely because we have suffered from the devastation and oppression of imperialist wars in the past, and are now enjoying the happiness of peace and liberation, that we can most easily understand the situation of those people who have not yet been liberated and are suffering from imperialist trampling, so we are also the most resolute in striving for and defending peace.

    In order to celebrate the convening of the Peace Conference, all the workers of our plant further launched a labor competition in mid-September. The Li Youzhi group further increased the "blast temperature" by 100 degrees on the basis of the previous improvement. Other groups have proposed specific guarantees to complete the plant's increased production task of 11.23% in the second half of the year, and continue to vigorously carry out patriotic sanitation, to fight back against the war mongers and strive for and defend the common peace of the people of the world.
                                                                                                All the Workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

    Chinese People of All Nationalities Love Peace

    Editor: We are the young students of all nationalities of the Central University for Nationalities. We enthusiastically celebrate the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in our country's capital with unparalleled excitement. The people of all nationalities in China love peace and deeply understand the importance of holding the Peace Conference. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries cruelly ruled our minority nationalities; the imperialist invaders also committed bloody crimes in our regions under the cloak of religion. Under the barbaric oppression and exploitation of these robbers, our minority nationalities worked hard all year round, but could not get enough food and clothing, let alone have the opportunity to study. We have thus been mired in poverty and backwardness for a long time.

    Now, under the warm sunshine of Chairman Mao, our people of all nationalities live happily in the big family of the motherland with love and cooperation. We have established 130 ethnic regional autonomous regions and have our own political power. Our lives are getting better day by day, the prices of local products have increased several times to dozens of times, and industrial products have also been sold to our remote areas. People sing: "Wear cotton coats in winter, wear single clothes in summer, and wear夹衣in February and August." We have our own ethnic schools, study in our own languages, and can also come to Beijing to study. All this shows that our country's nationalities are increasingly moving towards happiness and prosperity under the leadership of Chairman Mao. We deeply know that happiness and prosperity are inseparable from peace; defending peace is defending our happy life. And today, peace is increasingly being severely threatened by US imperialism. We must not allow a small handful of war mongers to push our peace-loving people of all nationalities onto the path of war. We warmly hope that the peace fighters attending the conference will turn our desire for peace into a powerful force for defending peace and crush the arrogant attempts of the war mongers.
                                                                                                  All Students of the Central University for Nationalities

    Religious Believers Praying for Peace

    Editor: The news of the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference inspires every peace-loving people. All the Catholics in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, are also delighted about this. We have all prayed for peace and held forums to widely promote it, to welcome this peace conference of great significance.

    War is a disaster, and peace is happiness. The facts are becoming increasingly clear that where peace construction is being carried out, the people there live a free and happy life, and human morality and international equality, mutual benefit, and friendly cooperation are truly respected, consolidated, and developed; where arms expansion and war preparation are being carried out, chemical weapons, atomic bombs, and bacteria are used to destroy humanity and intimidate the people, the people there suffer from hunger and oppression, and even the basic principles of international trust and humanitarianism are trampled upon. The Chinese people have, through their own arduous struggle, under the wise leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, overcome the reactionary forces at home and abroad, gotten rid of the disasters of war, and achieved independence, peace, freedom, and happiness. The Chinese people have deeply tasted the pain of war and also understand the loveliness of peace. Therefore, the Chinese people are determined to defend peace and want to eliminate war and the threat of war from the human world.

    Peace is a sacred doctrine revered by Catholicism. Therefore, we regard safeguarding peace as our sacred duty as Catholics. At the same time, peace is also the common and noble desire of all mankind. Except for a very few war mongers who rely on war to make fortunes, peace is the common cause of all mankind. In the cause of defending peace, we Catholics and the peace-loving people of the world have one goal, one direction—we want to enable all mankind to interact equally and cooperate closely, moving towards the happy society they idealize!

    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference unites the vast peace-loving people of various countries, various nationalities, and various political and religious beliefs in the Asian and Pacific regions, striving for the common cause of peace for mankind. All the Catholics in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, enthusiastically support the convening of this conference.

    Chen Sui, Chairman of the Taiyuan Catholic Innovation Movement Promotion Committee

    I Hope the People of Malaya Can Have an Independent, Free, and Peaceful Life

    Editor: First of all, let me pay my highest respect to the representatives attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. I am a young student of New China, but Malaya is my second hometown. I grew up there as a child, I am familiar with it, and I love it. There are lush coconut groves and dense rubber plantations, there are durian trees, rambutans, bananas, and pineapples, and in the coconut groves, the atap houses are inhabited by those simple people wearing sarongs. How beautiful all this is! Unfortunately, for a century, the people of Malaya have not been able to live a peaceful and happy life on their own rich land.

    The people of Malaya must not have forgotten the days when the iron hooves of Japanese militarism trampled on Malaya, the days when "Singapore" was renamed "Shonan Island." How tragic was the fate of the people of Malaya at that time! People will never forget how 100,000 Malayan residents were taken by Japanese invaders in trucks to be slaughtered. My brother was one of these 100,000 residents. Eleven years ago, he left like this and never returned, leaving behind a weak sister-in-law and a nephew still in her arms. How cruel! The people of Malaya will never forget this blood debt.

    Now, although the Japanese devils are gone, the lives of the people of Malaya have not improved. The atap houses in the Malayan mountain areas are suffering from the unreasonable burning of another imperialism; everywhere there are barbed wire and concentration camps; hunger and poverty seriously threaten the lives of the people of Malaya; any book that can express a little "humanity" is in danger of being listed as a "prohibited book"; peace-loving people are arrested at any time and anywhere for unwarranted crimes; any youth over the age of 18 may be arrested and used as cannon fodder, and they can no longer settle down to study. But, I know, the people of Malaya, like the people of the world, love peace, and the people of Malaya yearn for an independent, free, and peaceful life.

    Before liberation, the Chinese people also suffered such barbaric trampling, and also had this desire for an independent, free, and peaceful life. What is gratifying is that this desire is no longer a "yearning" today, but a reality. Precisely because of this, in order to defend today's happy and beautiful life, and to build a more happy and beautiful future tomorrow, we do not need war, we resolutely oppose war. I am studying electrical engineering. I have never thought about how to use electricity to slaughter good people. What I think about is how to generate more kilowatts of electricity to supply the needs of factory and rural production and construction.

    We do need peace. The peaceful wishes of the 1.6 billion people in our Asian and Pacific regions can be realized through the united efforts of everyone.
                                                                             Chen Shengxin, Female Student of the Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University

    We Want to Unite with the Indonesian People

    Editor: In order to devote themselves to the cause of peace in the Asian and Pacific regions, the representatives of the peace-loving people of 37 countries have traveled across the oceans to our country's capital—Beijing to hold a meeting. Let me extend my condolences to the hard work of the representatives, and express my respect for their efforts for the cause of peace.

    I am a Chinese youth of the Mao Zedong era, but I grew up in Indonesia—this warm and beautiful country where it is summer all year round. My childhood and adolescence were spent in Indonesia. I remember: seven years ago, when the iron hooves of the mad Japanese fascists were trampling on Indonesia, how dark and desolate the lives of the Indonesian people were. Indonesia is a rice-producing country, but at that time, the Indonesian people could not buy food.

    At that time, I was still a child, and in that environment, I could not understand more things.

    Two years ago, I returned to the liberated motherland and received the motherland's meticulous care and education. I have grown up and become stronger. The motherland, like a loving mother, cares for and educates me, and makes me understand many things. I understand: who destroyed the happy life of mankind, who hindered the safety of mankind, and today, who is trying to enslave the people of the world. I also understand why the lives of the people I saw in Indonesia were so dark and desolate.

    When I feel more deeply that today is happiness, I also understand more deeply the importance of defending a happy life. Today, US imperialism is reviving Japanese militarism again, attempting to repeat the cruel crimes of seven years ago. This seriously threatens the peaceful lives of the people of China, Indonesia, Asia, and the world. We must resolutely oppose their evil deeds. For our motherland and the mothers and children of the world, we must take on the cause of defending peace.

    Let us—the Chinese people and the Indonesian people, and the people of the world, unite closely!
                                                                                                          Xie Huanying, Student of Beijing Normal University

    American Imperialists Are the Common Enemy of the People of All Countries

    Editor: Loving peace is the tradition of our country and nation. We warmly welcome the representatives of all countries attending this Peace Conference; we are willing to hear the voices of the people of all countries—the voice of peace—during the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

    People can clearly see that the warmongers of the United States are continuing to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations; in the war of aggression against Korea, they have planned and prepared to use bacteriological weapons to slaughter mankind in Korea and Northeast China, and recently have more planned to wantonly bomb the peaceful cities and villages of Korea. These crimes are condemned by every good people, and are also intolerable to the American people.

    We oppose one country interfering in the internal affairs of another country, and the army of one country invading the territory of another country; we oppose using "blockades" and "embargoes" to prevent mutual trade and cultural exchanges between the people of all countries, and to hinder mutual understanding and friendly exchanges between the people of all countries. We believe that these are also opposed by the American people.

    We know that the American people have their own way of life that they like. We oppose anyone interfering in their way of life; but now, the ones who are truly interfering with them are a small handful of warmongers in their own country who make fortunes through war. These warmongers send the husbands and sons of American women to Korea as cannon fodder, making the lives of the American people more and more difficult. The warmongers are still clamoring for war, attempting to push all good mankind into the evil vortex of war. They are the common enemy of all peace-loving people. I believe that in the struggle for peace, the people of all countries will unite regardless of national boundaries, race, political views, or religious beliefs, and strive for the peaceful and happy life of all mankind!
                                                                                                  Chen Dingbao and Seven Others

    Teachers Need a Peaceful Teaching Environment

    Editor: The representatives of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference have come to our country's capital, Beijing, with the wishes of 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions who demand peace and oppose war, to discuss ways to strive for and defend peace. This is the greatest joy for our Chinese people. All the teachers and staff of Tsinghua University extend our highest respect to the representatives with the most excitement.

    The Chinese people, in order to strive for peace and freedom, went through arduous bloody struggles, defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and obtained a peaceful construction environment, so that they have today's freedom and happiness. For three years, the people of the whole country have lived an unprecedentedly good life under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and are striving to create an even happier and more fulfilling life.

    Our Tsinghua University has already had tremendous reforms and development, and will have even greater reforms and development in the future. At the time of liberation, the entire school had only 2,000 students, but now, including the newly enrolled students, it has increased to 5,800 students. The school buildings added this year are equal to 46% of those built in the past 40 years. Our teaching and research work has gotten rid of the shortcomings of being divorced from reality in the past, and is becoming increasingly closely integrated with the needs of the motherland; the students' meals are all provided by the state, and after graduation, the government uniformly introduces jobs based on the students' abilities and aspirations. The phenomena of students being sallow and thin, malnourished, and unemployed after graduation have disappeared forever. From the next semester, our school will become a new type of multidisciplinary industrial university, specializing in training technical cadres for the motherland's large-scale economic construction. All our teachers and staff are welcoming this new task with unparalleled enthusiasm, and are striving to build a more fulfilling and happier motherland.

    We know that such a good life has been exchanged for by the bloodshed and sweat of millions of revolutionaries who defeated the enemy. Therefore, we not only cherish our today, but also make a hundred times more effort to create a better tomorrow. We also know that only by striving for lasting peace can we guarantee our fulfilling and happy today and strive for a better tomorrow. Therefore, we demand peace and oppose wars of aggression.

    We have not forgotten that Japanese imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries made us suffer all the hardships and tortures of war; but we have also seen that Japanese imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries have suffered a shameful defeat in front of the Chinese people who have stood up. Today, American imperialists are launching a new war of aggression in Korea, and are still vainly trying to attack China. Peace-loving people must resolutely oppose war and defend peace. The consolidated friendship between China and the Soviet Union and the close unity of the world's peace-loving people are the cornerstones of defending peace and opposing war.
                                                       All Teachers and Staff of the Tsinghua University Committee of the China Education Union

    Children Hate War and Demand Peace

    Editor: The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing, the capital of our great motherland, represents the heartfelt wishes of 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions. I wish this conference a success, and let the flowers of peace bloom all over the earth!

    I am an educator. I deeply realize that peace is the source of happiness; with peace, mothers can peacefully raise their children, children can quietly read and play happily, workers and peasants can work happily, and our country can accelerate towards the happy future of mankind.

    In the classroom and on campus, I have asked countless young friends and lovely children, and they all sing in unison without hesitation, singing the praises of peace. Everyone asks for a peaceful and happy country, a warm family, and a peaceful environment, so that they can study better. What I can never forget is a twelve-year-old child painfully recalling the tragic scene of her mother being bombed to death by Japanese planes during the Anti-Japanese War. She suppressed the pain in her heart, and stared at me with a pair of round, bright eyes and said: "Principal: My mother died in the war. I hate war as soon as I mention it. How much I hope there will never be war in this life... When she thought that US imperialism was launching a war of aggression in Korea and vainly trying to attack China, she wiped the corners of her eyes with a small handkerchief and said excitedly: "If it weren't for the volunteers, uncles, and aunts fighting the American devils together with the Korean People's Army in Korea, we wouldn't be able to study here. I want to work hard to strive for and defend peace!" How lovely are the children of New China nurtured by Mao Zedong! They love peace and understand the truth.

    Yes, we should take practical actions to defend peace. In addition to doing my educational work well, I am also willing to be a peace propagandist, using every opportunity to promote the value of peace to the people around me, and to promote the strength of the world peace camp and the great victory of the good people of the world in the struggle to defend peace.
                                                                                    Ao Hairui, Educator in Nanchang, Jiangxi

    Convening the Peace Conference Suits Our Wishes

    Editor: I used to be a shop worker, and only after liberation did I get the opportunity to study. Due to the needs of national construction, I have now been transferred to the Central University of Finance and Economics for further study. Here, food, clothing, books, etc. are all provided by the people, and each person can also receive a monthly allowance. In February this year, I got sick, and the public provided me with nearly one million yuan for medical expenses. The government treats us as the "treasure" of the country, and nurtures us patiently. I never thought that a former shop assistant could afford to study at a university! Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming, but it's true. I often think like this: how can I train myself to be stronger and contribute more to the motherland.

    However, the enemies of peace are trying to destroy our happy life. They are clamoring for war everywhere, and have already ignited the flames of war in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya. There, smoke fills the peaceful countryside, many schools, sanatoriums, and libraries have become ruins, children have lost their mothers, wives have lost their husbands... All this is still fresh in the memory of the Chinese people and myself. When the Japanese invaders occupied my hometown, shells killed my grandfather, my father also fell ill, and I lost the opportunity to go to school. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, I went to work as an apprentice in a shop in Shanghai, and all day long I washed rice, washed vegetables, emptied chamber pots, and had to be beaten and scolded. At that time, I thought this was just my "fate"!

    In today's happy days, I deeply realize the pain of war and the loveliness of peace. We firmly oppose war. The convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is in line with our wishes. I am willing to fight to the end for the thorough implementation of all the resolutions of this conference.
                                                                                                              Li Shiling, Central University of Finance and Economics

### 祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开

    祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开
    编者按：首都和全国各地人民，日来纷纷写信给本报，祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开。这些信，充分地表达了中国人民热爱和平的愿望和保卫和平的决心，表达了中国人民和亚洲、太平洋区域各国人民之间的共同愿望，以及中国人民对于为争取和平而英勇斗争的各国代表的崇高的敬意。现在，选登一部分来信在下面：
    解放军战士决心保卫和平
    编辑同志：我是一个解放军的海军战士。我热烈地祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在我国首都召开。
    想起日本军国主义者蹂躏我国八年的漫长的日子——强盗们使用“三光政策”、“强化治安”等凶残的手段屠杀手无寸铁的善良的中国人民，使多少美丽的城市和村庄变成了废墟，使千百万和平居民处在饥寒交迫、流离失所以至死亡的境地，我的心就发疼。我也就想起我的父亲——一个勤劳厚道的农民——是怎样在这种日子里死去的。
    八年前我的家住在石德路的一个小车站的旁边。在一次“日本皇军”出来“扫荡”的时候，我的父亲被鬼子们抓住了。野兽们一言不问就在他的腹部刺了三刺刀，头上又给加上一枪。我父亲就这样无辜死去。那时我年纪很小，有什么办法呢！只能把仇恨深深地埋在幼小的心头。
    现在，我长大了。在毛主席和共产党的教育下，我成为一个革命战士。现在我手里握紧着的是枪。我守卫着祖国的海防和边疆，守卫着全中国人民的幸福。你说，我能够让美帝国主义复活日本军国主义再来侵略我国吗？当然不能！我要向出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各国代表们保证：我们新中国的人民战士有信心有力量保卫远东及世界的和平。
                                海军炮校警卫营战士　赵耀华
    石景山钢铁厂开展生产竞赛庆贺和平会议
    编辑同志：我们石景山钢铁厂全体职工以十分兴奋的心情，祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在我国的首都召开。
    以美帝国主义为首的战争贩子们，不顾全世界人民的反对，破坏国际公约，图谋复活德国法西斯和武装日本军国主义，威胁着世界各国人民的和平生活。
    我们石景山钢铁厂的工人，曾亲身遭受过日寇残酷的压迫。那时我们吃的是又苦又臭带毛的黑豆面，穿的是水泥袋纸做的衣服，我们深刻知道帝国主义侵略者是惨无人道的。
    我们厂在三年多的和平建设中，生产上有了显著的成绩。某号炉超过日伪时最高产量的百分之二百七十；在苏联专家帮助下，我们修复了国民党反动派要当废铁出卖的炼铁炉。生产发展了，我们工人的生活福利也有了很大的改善。现在职工们吃的是大米和白面，每个人都有两、三套新衣服，百分之七十以上的工人都骑上了崭新的自行车。我们有自己的医院、俱乐部、业余学校和图书馆，每星期可以免费看三次电影，新的疗养院正在修盖。
    正是由于我们过去曾经受过帝国主义侵略战争的摧残和压迫，而现在又正享受着和平和解放的幸福，所以我们最容易体会到那些还未解放而正遭受帝国主义蹂躏的人民的处境，所以我们对争取和保卫和平也是最坚决的。
    为了庆祝和平会议的召开，我厂全体职工在九月中旬进一步展开了劳动竞赛。李有芝小组在已经提高的基础上再提高“风温”一百度，其他各小组都提出了具体保证条件，来完成全厂下半年增产任务百分之十一点二三，并继续大力作好爱国卫生，来回击战争贩子，争取和保卫全世界人民共同的和平。　石景山钢铁厂全体职工
    中国各民族人民热爱和平
    编辑同志：我们是中央民族学院的各民族的青年学生。我们以无比兴奋的心情热烈地庆祝亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在我们祖国的首都召开。我们中国各民族的人民是热爱和平的，并且深切地体会到召开和平会议的重要意义。过去，国民党反动派曾经残酷地统治过我们少数民族；帝国主义侵略者也曾经披着宗教的外衣在我们地区干下了血腥的罪恶勾当。在这伙强盗野蛮的压迫和剥削下，我们少数民族终年辛勤劳动，却得不到温饱，更不可能有读书的机会。我们就这样长期地陷于穷困和落后的境地。
    现在，我们各族人民在毛主席的和煦阳光的普照下，幸福地生活在友爱合作的祖国大家庭里。我们已建立了一百三十个民族区域自治区，有了自己的政权。我们的生活一天比一天美好，土产品价格提高几倍到几十倍，工业品也推销到我们边远的地区了，人们欢唱：“冬穿棉袄，夏穿单，二、八月里还有夹衣穿。”我们有了自己的民族学校，用自己的语文学习，而且还可以到北京来学习。这一切都表明我们祖国各民族在毛主席的领导下，正日益走向幸福与繁荣。我们深切地知道幸福和繁荣是与和平分不开的；保卫和平就是保卫我们的幸福生活。而今天，和平正在日益遭受着美帝国主义的严重的威胁，我们决不能让一小撮战争贩子把我们爱好和平的各民族人民推向战争的道路。我们热烈地希望参加会议的和平战士们，把我们要求和平的意愿汇成保卫和平的强大力量，粉碎战争贩子们的狂妄的企图。　中央民族学院全体学员
    宗教信仰者在为和平祈祷
    编辑同志：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议召开的消息，激励着每一个爱好和平的人民。我们山西省太原市天主教全体教友也为这件事而欢欣鼓舞。我们都为和平进行了祈祷，并举行座谈会广泛开展宣传，来迎接这一具有重大意义的和平会议。
    战争就是灾难，和平就是幸福。事实愈来愈明显地使人们看到：那里在从事和平建设，那里的人民便过着自由幸福的生活，人类道义以及国际间的平等互惠和友好合作，也得到了真正的尊崇、巩固和发展；那里在从事扩军备战，化学武器、原子弹和细菌被用来毁灭人类和恫吓人民的勾当，那里的人民便遭受饥饿和压迫，国际信义和人道主义的起码原则也被践踏无余。中国人民是以自己的艰苦奋斗，在伟大的毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导下，战胜了国内外的反动派，摆脱了战争的灾难，而取得独立、和平、自由与幸福的。中国人民深深尝到了战争的痛苦，也懂得了和平的可爱，因此，中国人民坚决地保卫和平，要把战争和战争的威胁从人类世界上铲除掉。
    和平是天主教尊崇的神圣的教义。因此，我们把维护和平当作我们天主教友的神圣天职。同时，和平也是全人类共同的崇高的愿望，除极少数依靠战争发财的战争贩子们外，和平是一切人类的共同事业。在保卫和平事业中，我们天主教友和全世界和平人类是一个目标，一个方向——我们要使全人类都能平等往来和亲密合作，向着他们自己所理想的幸福社会前进！
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议把亚洲及太平洋区域各个国家、各个民族、各种不同的政治和宗教信仰的广大爱好和平的人民团结在一起，为人类共同的和平事业而奋斗。我们山西省太原市天主教全体教友热忱拥护这个会议的召开。

    我希望马来亚人民能得到独立、自由、和平的生活
    编辑同志：首先让我向出席亚洲及太平洋区域的代表们致以崇高的敬意。我是个新中国的青年学生，但马来亚是我的第二故乡。我小时生长在那里，我熟悉那里，我热爱那里。那里有茂盛的椰林和密密的橡胶园，那里有榴梿树、红毛丹、香蕉和黄梨，在椰林中亚答屋里住着的是那些穿着沙龙的淳朴的人民，这一切是多么美好呀！可惜，一个世纪以来，马来亚的人民一直不能在这块自己的富饶的土地上过和平幸福的生活。
    马来亚的人民一定没有忘记那日本军国主义的铁蹄蹂躏马来亚的日子，那“新嘉坡”被改叫“昭南岛”的日子，那时候马来亚的人民的命运多么悲惨！人们更不会忘记十万马来亚居民是怎样被日本侵略者的卡车载去屠杀的情形。我的哥哥就是这十万居民当中的一个。十一年前，他就这样一去不复返了；剩下羸弱的嫂嫂和还在怀抱里的侄儿。多么残酷呀！马来亚的人民是永远不会忘记这笔血债的。
    现在，日本鬼子虽然走了，可是马来亚的人民生活并没有好起来。马来亚山芭的亚答屋又在遭受着另一个帝国主义蛮横无理的焚烧；到处都是铁丝网和集中营；饥饿和贫困严重地威胁着马来亚人民的生活；稍为能够表达一点“人性”的书都有被列入
    “禁书”的危险；爱和平的人民随时随地都会以莫须有的罪名被逮捕；凡是十八岁以上的青年都有被抓去当炮灰的可能，他们已经不能安下心来念书了。但是，我知道，马来亚的人民和世界人民一样是热爱和平的，马来亚人民是渴望着独立、自由、和平的生活的。
    解放以前的中国人民也遭受过这种野蛮的蹂躏，也有过这种渴望独立、自由和和平生活的心愿。可喜的是，这种心愿在今天已经不再是什么“渴望”，而是现实的生活了。正因为是这样，我们为了保卫今天幸福美好的生活，为了建设明天更幸福更美好的前途，我们不需要战争，我们坚决反对战争。我是一个学电机工程的，我从来没有想过怎样用电去屠杀善良的人民，我想的是怎样发更多瓩的电供给工厂和农村生产建设的需要。
    我们的确需要和平。我们亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民的和平愿望，在大家团结一致的努力下是可以实现的。

    我们要和印度尼西亚人民团结在一起
    编辑同志：为了致力于亚洲及太平洋区域的和平事业，三十七个国家的爱好和平的人民的代表远涉重洋地来到了我国的首都——北京开会。让我为各位代表们的辛劳致以慰问，为他们对和平事业的努力表示敬意。
    我是一个毛泽东时代的中国青年，但是我却是在印度尼西亚——这个长年是夏的热情而美丽的国家里生长的。我的幼年、少年都是在印度尼西亚度过的。我记得：七年前当疯狂的日本法西斯主义者的铁蹄践踏着印度尼西亚时，印度尼西亚人民的生活是多么阴暗和凄凉。印度尼西亚是一个出产稻米的国家，但是那时印度尼西亚人民却买不到粮食。
    那时我还是一个孩子，在那样的环境下，我也不可能懂得更多的事情。
    两年前我回到解放了的祖国，受到了祖国无微不至的爱护和教育。我成长、健壮起来了。祖国，像慈母一样关怀和教养着我，使我懂得了许多事情。我明白：是谁破坏了人类幸福的生活，是谁妨碍了人类的安全，今天，又是谁企图奴役全世界人民。我也懂得了为什么我在印度尼西亚时看到的人们的生活会是那样阴暗和凄凉。
    当我更深刻地感觉到今天是幸福的时候，我也就更深刻地懂得保卫幸福的生活的重要。今天美帝国主义又在复活日本军国主义，企图重演七年前的残酷罪行。这就严重地威胁着中国、印度尼西亚、亚洲和世界人民的和平生活，我们必须坚决反对他们的罪恶行为。为了我们祖国以及全世界的母亲和孩子们，我们要把保卫和平的事业担当起来。
    让我们——中国人民和印度尼西亚人民及全世界的人民紧密地团结在一起吧！

    美国帝国主义者是各国人民的公敌
    编辑同志：热爱和平是我们国家和民族的传统。我们热烈地欢迎出席这次和平会议的各国代表们；我们愿意在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议期间听到各国人民的声音——和平的声音。
    人们清楚地看到：美国的好战分子正在继续破坏朝鲜停战谈判；在侵略朝鲜的战争中，有计划有准备地在朝鲜和我国的东北，使用屠杀人类的细菌武器，最近更有计划地狂轰滥炸朝鲜的和平城市及和平乡村。这些罪行是每个善良的人民所同声指责的，也是美国人民所不能容忍的。
    我们反对一个国家干涉另一个国家的内政，一个国家的军队侵略另一个国家的国土；我们反对以“封锁”、“禁运”阻止各国人民间的互相贸易和文化交流，阻碍各国人民间的相互了解和友好往来。我们相信这些也都是美国人民所反对的。
    我们知道，美国人民有着自己所喜欢的生活方式。我们反对任何人去干涉他们的生活方式；但是，现在真正干涉他们的，正是他们自己国家里的一小撮靠战争发财的战争贩子。这些战争贩子们把美国妇女的丈夫和儿子送到朝鲜去当炮灰，使美国人民的生活一天比一天更加困难，战争贩子们还在叫嚣战争，企图把整个善良的人类推进罪恶的战争漩涡中去。他们是一切爱好和平的人民的共同敌人。相信各国人民在争取和平的斗争中，将会不分国界、种族、政治见解、宗教信仰，团结一致，为了争取全人类的和平幸福生活而奋斗！

    教师们需要和平的教学环境
    编辑同志：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表们带着十六亿人民要求和平、反对战争的意愿，来到我国首都北京开会，商讨争取和保卫和平的办法，这是我们中国人民的最大喜悦。我们清华大学全体教师、职工以最兴奋的心情，向代表们致以崇高的敬意。
    中国人民为了争取和平与自由，经过了艰苦的流血斗争，打垮了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派，取得了和平的建设环境，才有了今天的自由和幸福。三年以来，全国人民在毛主席领导下过着空前未有的好日子，而且正在为创造更幸福更美满的日子而奋斗。
    我们清华大学已经有了巨大的改革与发展，今后将有更大的改革与发展。刚解放时全校只有学生二千人，现在连招收的新生在内已经增加到五千八百人。今年所增加的校舍，等于过去四十年来修建的百分之四十六。我们的教学与研究工作已经摆脱了过去脱离实际的缺点，正与祖国的需要日益密切结合；学生们的膳食全部由国家供给，毕业后由政府根据学生的能力与志愿统一介绍工作，以往学生面黄肌瘦、营养不良和毕业即失业的现象已经一去不复返了。从下学期起，我们学校要成为一个新型的多科性的工业大学，专门为祖国的大规模经济建设培养技术干部。我们全体教师、职工都以无比的热情来迎接这新的任务，为建设更美满更幸福的祖国而努力。
    我们知道，这样美好的日子是经过千百万革命者流血流汗，打败了敌人换得来的。所以，我们不仅珍惜我们的今天，还要百倍地努力创造更美好的明天。我们也知道：只有争取持久和平，才能保障我们美满幸福的今天与争取更美好的明天。所以我们要求和平，反对侵略战争。
    我们没有忘记日本帝国主义者及国民党反动派使我们受尽了战争的苦难和折磨；但是我们也看到日本帝国主义者及国民党反动派已经在站起来的中国人民面前遭到了可耻的失败。今天美帝国主义者正在朝鲜发动新的侵略战争，并且还妄想进攻中国。爱好和平的人民，要坚决反对战争保卫和平。中苏两国巩固的友谊和世界和平人民的紧密团结，就是保卫和平、反对战争的砥柱。

    孩子们痛恨战争要求和平
    编辑同志：在我们伟大祖国的首都——北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，代表着亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民衷心的愿望。我遥祝这个会议的成功，让和平的花朵开遍大地吧！
    我是一个教育工作者。我深深地体会到和平是幸福的泉源；有了和平，母亲们才可以安祥地抚养孩子，儿童们才可以恬静地读书和愉快地游戏，工人、农民才可以愉快地劳动，我们的国家才可以加速地走向人类幸福的未来。
    在课堂上和校园里，我曾经问过无数个青年朋友们和可爱的孩子们，他们都毫不犹疑地、异口同声地歌唱和平。每一个人都要求有一个和平幸福的国家，温暖的家庭和宁静的环境，使他们能够更好地学习。永远使我不能忘记的，是一个十二岁的小朋友在痛苦地回忆她的母亲在抗日战争时期被日本飞机炸死的悲惨情景。她抑制了内心的悲痛，瞪起一双圆圆的、明亮的眼睛对我说：“校长：我的母亲是死于战争的。一提起战争我就痛恨。我是多么希望这辈子再也不要有战争。……”当她想到美帝国主义在朝鲜发动侵略战争还妄想打到中国来的时候，她用小手帕揩了一下眼角，激昂地对我说：“要不是有志愿军伯伯叔叔们在朝鲜和朝鲜人民军一起打美国鬼子，我们又不能在这里念书了。我要努力争取和保卫和平！”在毛泽东教养下的新中国的孩子们是多么可爱啊！她们热爱和平又懂得真理。
    是的，我们应该以实际行动来保卫和平。除了作好我的教育工作以外，我还愿意作一个和平的宣传者，利用一切机会向周围的人宣传和平的可贵，宣传世界和平阵营力量的强大和全世界善良的人民在保卫和平斗争中的伟大的胜利。

    召开和平会议正合我们的愿望
    编辑同志：我原来是一个店员工人，解放后才获得学习的机会。由于祖国建设的需要，我现在又被调到中央财政学院来深造。在这里，吃的、穿的、书籍等都是由人民供给，每人每月还可领到津贴。今年二月里我生了病，公家还供给我近百万元的医疗费。政府把我们当做国家的“财宝”，耐心地抚育着。想不到过去的店员今天能够读得起高等学校！有时我就好像在做梦，但确实是事实啊。我常常这样想：怎么样才能把自己锻炼得更坚强，为祖国贡献更大的力量。
    但是，和平的敌人企图破坏我们的幸福生活，他们到处喧嚷着战争，并且早就在朝鲜、越南、马来亚燃起了战火。在那里，硝烟弥漫着和平的乡村，许多学校、疗养院、图书馆成了废墟，孩子失去了母亲，妻子失掉了丈夫……。这一切，对于中国人民，对于我自己是记忆犹新的事情。日寇侵占我的家乡时，炮弹炸死了我的祖父，我的父亲也病了，我从此失掉了上学的机会。国民党反动统治时期，我到上海一家商店去当学徒，整天淘米，洗菜，倒小便桶，还得挨打受骂。那时，我还以为这是自己的“命运”不好哩！
    在今天幸福的日子里，我深深体会到战争的痛苦和和平的可爱。我们坚决反对战争。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，正合乎我们的愿望。我愿为这次会议的一切决议的彻底实现而奋斗到底。
