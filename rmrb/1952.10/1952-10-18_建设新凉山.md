    Building a New Liangshan
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yu Jingqi
    In the eastern part of Xikang Province, between the Dadu River and the Jinsha River, lies a mountainous area with undulating peaks: Liangshan, the largest Yi people's settlement in China. On October 1st, the region held its first People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups and all circles. In accordance with the Central People's Government's Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy and the common aspirations of the Yi people, the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region People's Government was officially established.
    The autonomous region includes the original Zhaojue County Yi Autonomous Region and the newly established seven counties of Puge, Xide, Jinyang, Meigu, Butuo, and Puxiong, covering an area of over 30,000 square kilometers; inhabited by more than 700,000 Yi people and more than 20,000 Han and Miao people.
    This is a fertile land. The Meigu River, Xixi River, and Puxiong River, along with smaller water systems, form fertile valleys in the mountains. In the mountains and valleys, the Yi people grow oats, buckwheat, potatoes, rice, and soybeans; the forests abound in medicinal herbs and otters (otter skins are valuable furs); the abundant grasslands make Liangshan one of the main producing areas of "Sichuan horses" in China; and the underground mineral resources are infinitely rich. However, for many years, this place has recorded the tragic history of the Yi people. For example, in 1946, the Kuomintang bandit Chiang Kai-shek personally ordered the dispatch of four regiments, in coordination with the air force, to "encircle and suppress" the people of the Puxiong area twice. The reactionary rulers also provoked internal feuds among the Yi people, called "fighting enemies," causing great social chaos. The Yi people recalled the situation at that time: "We had to stand guard while farming, dared not open windows in our houses, dared not let cattle and sheep graze far away, had to sleep with guns in our arms, and dared not go more than twenty li when going out." The Yi people were confined to the deep mountains for so long, which further deepened the division between the Yi and Han nationalities, and their lives were very poor. At that time, there was no market in the entire region, no proper commodity exchange, food was scarce for more than half the year, and salt and cloth were extremely scarce. There were no schools in the entire region.
    After liberation, the Xikang Provincial People's Government correctly implemented the ethnic policy, sending the Liangshan Work Group deep into the high mountains and forests to publicize the policy of ethnic equality, unity, and mutual assistance, holding various forums and mass meetings, and calling on the Yi people to unite and build Liangshan. The sincere attitude of the People's Government working cadres in serving the people quickly eliminated the doubts and concerns of the Yi people. With the help of the work group, they established a regional mediation committee and twenty regional mediation committees. In the past two years, they have mediated more than 3,000 disputes of all sizes, many of which were "old feuds" lasting for decades. At the beginning of last year, at a forum of more than 230 representatives from more than 40 branches in Liangshan, all the people's representatives solemnly signed a regional unity pact in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, swearing to permanently stop fighting, creating an unprecedentedly united situation in the Liangshan area.
    On the basis of ethnic unity, the Liangshan area has successively established the Zhaojue County Yi Autonomous Region and 72 district and township-level people's governments such as Hongmaomagou, absorbing a large number of activists who emerged in the movements of unity and bandit suppression to participate in government work. The ethnic schools in Xichang Prefecture have also cultivated a group of Yi cadres for Liangshan.
    In order to gradually improve the economic life of all ethnic groups, the local people's governments led the Yi and other ethnic groups to launch a patriotic production movement. In addition to establishing four state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms centered on Zhaojue to conduct typical demonstrations, the People's Government dispatched nearly 20 production guidance groups this year to go deep into various places to guide farmers in building water conservancy projects and improving production techniques; it distributed more than 600,000 jin of rice and more than 8,000 pieces of agricultural implements. More than 21,000 farmers in the region have organized 457 production teams, actively producing, and the farming techniques of the Yi farmers have also been initially improved. The People's Government promptly provided relief to areas that had suffered hailstorms, such as Jienlatin, and led the masses to replant in a timely manner. Therefore, the entire region has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, with the average output of the main grains, buckwheat and potatoes, increasing by more than 50% compared to last year.
    The trade in the Liangshan area has also developed greatly. The income from the region's native products accounts for 30% of the people's total income. At present, state-owned trade institutions at all levels and four primary markets have been established in the region. State-owned trade institutions have also sent many mobile trade teams to go deep into rural areas to purchase local products and supply daily industrial products. The state-owned trading company also appropriately increased the purchase prices of local products. This year, the People's Government has also built the Zhaojue-Xichang mule and horse road, and the three post roads running through Liangshan and the highway leading to Sichuan will also be started soon, which will promote the gradual prosperity of the economy in the Liangshan area.
    The face of the Liangshan countryside has changed greatly. Many farmers are adding new clothes and buying livestock, and are beginning to live a life of warmth and contentment. Yi children are also being sent to school to learn their own ethnic script. From their own experiences, the Yi people have deeply realized that Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are the saviors of all ethnic peoples. They love their developing happy life and love their motherland. After the establishment of the Yi Autonomous Region in Liangshan, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and people's governments at all levels, the people of all ethnic groups will continue to build a new Liangshan with full confidence.

    建设新凉山
    新华社记者  于竞祁
    西康省东部，在大渡河和金沙江之间有一片峰峦起伏的山岳地带，这是我国最大的彝族人民聚居区——凉山。十月一日，这里举行了全区首届各族各界人民代表会议，按照中央人民政府民族区域自治实施纲要和彝族人民的共同愿望，正式成立了凉山彝族自治区人民政府。
    自治区包括原有的昭觉县彝族自治区和新建的普格、喜德、金阳、美姑、布拖、普雄等七个县，面积约三万多平方公里；居住着七十多万彝族人民和两万多汉族苗族人民。
    这是一块丰饶的土地，美姑河、西溪河、普雄河的大小水系在丛山中构成了一片片肥沃的河谷。在山地和这些河谷中，彝族人民种植着燕麦、荞麦、洋芋、稻米和大豆；在丛林中盛产药材及水獭（水獭皮是名贵兽皮）；丰盛的草地使凉山成为我国“川马”主要产地之一；地下矿藏更是无限丰富。但是多少年来，这里却记载着彝族人民悲惨的历史。例如：一九四六年，蒋介石匪首就曾亲自下令出动四个团的兵力，配合空军，两次“围剿”普雄地区的人民。反动统治者并且挑拨彝族人民内部互相仇杀
    “打冤家”，使社会秩序十分混乱。彝族人民回忆当年的情景说：“我们种地要放哨，住屋不敢开窗子，牛羊不敢远放，睡觉要抱着枪，出门不敢走出二十里路。”彝族人民这样长期被困深山，更加深了彝汉民族间的隔阂，他们的生活也非常贫困。那时全区没有一个市场，没有正当的商品交换，粮食要缺半年以上，盐、布更是奇缺，全区没有一所学校。
    解放以后，西康省人民政府正确执行了民族政策，派出凉山工作团深入高山深林去宣传民族平等团结互助政策，召开各种座谈会、群众会，号召彝族人民团结起来建设凉山。人民政府工作干部真诚为人民服务的态度，迅速消除了彝族人民的怀疑和顾虑。在工作团的帮助下，他们建立了一个全区性的调解委员会和二十个地区性的调解委员会，两年来共调解了大小纠纷三千多件，其中许多是几十年的“老冤家”。去年初，在凉山四十多个支头二百三十多名代表的座谈会上，全体人民代表在毛主席像前庄严地订立了全区团结公约，宣誓永远停止械斗，使凉山地区出现了空前未有的团结局面。
    在民族团结的基础上，两年来凉山地区已先后建立了昭觉县彝族自治区和红毛妈姑等七十二个区、乡级的人民政府，吸收了大批在团结、剿匪等运动中涌现出的积极分子参加政府工作，西昌专区的民族学校也为凉山培养了一批彝族干部。
    为了逐步改善各族人民的经济生活，各地人民政府领导彝族和其他各族人民展开了爱国主义生产运动。人民政府除以昭觉为中心建立了四个国营农牧场进行典型示范外，今年派出了近二十个生产指导小组，深入各地指导农民兴修水利，改进生产技术；发放了六十多万斤大米和八千多件农具。全区已有二万一千多农民组织了四百五十七个生产小组，积极生产，彝族农民的耕作技术也初步提高了。对曾遭受雹灾的地区如吉恩拉丁等地，人民政府及时进行了救济，并领导群众及时抢种。因此，全区今年得到了空前的丰收，主要粮食荞麦、洋芋平均比去年增产百分之五十以上。
    凉山地区的贸易事业也大大发展。该区土特产品的收入占人民全部收入的百分之三十，目前全区已建立了各级国营贸易机构和四个初级市场，国营贸易机构并派出许多流动贸易小组，深入农村收购土特产品，供应日用工业品。国营贸易公司并适当地提高了土特产品的收购价格。今年人民政府又兴修了昭觉西昌的骡马大道，贯穿凉山的三条驿道和通往四川的公路也即将着手动工，这将促使凉山地区经济逐渐繁荣。
    凉山农村的面貌有了很大改变，许多农民都在添新衣买牲口，开始过着温饱的生活。彝族的孩子们也被送入学校，学习自己本民族的文字。彝族人民从亲身经历中深刻地体验到毛主席、共产党是各民族人民的救星，他们热爱正在发展着的幸福生活，热爱祖国。凉山地区成立彝族自治区以后，各族人民在中国共产党和各级人民政府领导下，将满怀信心地继续建设新凉山。
