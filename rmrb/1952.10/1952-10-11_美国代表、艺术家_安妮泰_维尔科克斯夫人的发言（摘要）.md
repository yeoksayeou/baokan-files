    Speech by Mrs. Annette Wilcox, U.S. Representative and Artist (Summary)
    We are here as representatives of seventy percent of the American people who, in an anonymous Gallup poll, expressed their true opinion and voted for an immediate end to the Korean War. We fully understand that as citizens of a democratic country, if we do not do our utmost to strive for peace, we will be responsible for the massacre of millions of men, women, and children in the Korean War. We came to this meeting to discuss effective ways to stop this massacre, realizing that as we speak, our planes are dropping napalm bombs. We ask our brothers and sisters in Asia and the Pacific region to help us stop the rearmament of Japan and Germany and the colonial oppression of the peoples of Southeast Asia, so as to prevent another Korean War from happening.
    We represent the majority of the people of our country and are here to demand an end to the massacre of prisoners of war on Koje Island and Jeju Island. On October 1, as our peace delegates visited the ancient city of Beijing to see this free nation gloriously and joyfully celebrate their National Day, forty-five more people were massacred on Jeju Island for daring to joyfully celebrate this holiday. We were inspired by the joyful singing of ten thousand children, and our indignation was strengthened by their determination to condemn this evil conspiracy to eliminate other nations and their industries and cultures. Our armed forces destroy barns and harvests on which others depend for their survival. They call homes, sampans, schools, and horses "military targets." Our air force bombs ox carts. Our navy sinks fishing boats. The parents of our soldiers have refused to accept the medals awarded by our government to their deceased sons for these "heroic acts."
    The majority of our people are only now beginning to learn the terrible facts about our use of napalm bombs. They do not yet know the facts about germ warfare. The report of the International Scientific Commission Investigation Team and the testimonies of Lieutenants O'Neill and Knis have not been widely disseminated in the United States. The government knows that our people are so deeply disgusted by the spread of disease that the highest military and political authorities and our representatives to the United Nations have categorically denied such actions. They continued to deny it even after the confessions of Lieutenants Enak and Quinn were reported in the newspapers. Various peace organizations will provide our people with the opportunity to study the evidence and make a decision. We believe that their response will be a loud voice that cannot be ignored, demanding that newspapers publish the report of the International Scientific Commission Investigation Team, and demanding that our government respond to the commission's accusations, ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol, and never again engage in germ warfare.
    Most parents will not believe that our children would commit such crimes. But the fact is that within our country, lynching, police brutality, and social discrimination are used daily to deprive our colored brothers of their basic rights, which makes our young people commit such brutal crimes in Korea.
    Today, Japan is a base for the Korean War and the Southeast Asian War. Our government, having just released Krupp and compensated him with eighty million dollars, is also supporting those Japanese war criminals who attacked Pearl Harbor. If Japan is fostered into a military power, we are not only in danger of another Korean War, but also in danger of being driven into a third world war. Our occupation of Taiwan with the remaining troops of the brutal Chiang Kai-shek is part of our preparation for a third world war. Seeking raw materials and manpower for the planned war, we are intensifying our interference in the countries of Latin America, adding even greater political pressure to those countries through bilateral military agreements, in addition to our economic exploitation. One of the tasks of the peace movement is to make everyone in the country understand and recognize these facts.
    There is no doubt that the propaganda, distortion, and deletion of our American newspapers, radio, movies, and television are the main causes of the confusion in the minds of our people. But in addition, we must consider another factor: there is a general perception that reducing our massive arms expansion plan would cause massive unemployment and economic depression. Our peace movement is emphasizing everywhere that peace does not necessarily bring economic depression. We are pleased that from this wide-ranging and very pragmatic meeting, we will bring back the message to our people that America's productive capacity has a peaceful market.
    Developing trade with Asia and undertaking urgently needed public works construction at home can fully absorb our productive capacity in the foreseeable future. In Asia, those peoples who are forging their own paths and the millions of others who are moving in the same direction have created a rapidly expanding market that can employ millions of American workers.
    Recently, we have had a trade deficit, importing more goods than we export, and as our resources are increasingly depleted, we will rely more and more on other countries. India and Latin America need all the food that we are now hoarding or destroying, and they are a huge and growing market for our agricultural products. This food is officially called "surplus food." When millions of children at home and abroad are starving, there is no such thing as surplus food. Destroying this food is a criminal act of hostility towards humanity and towards life itself.
    Restoring peaceful commercial relations can restore cultural relations. People should understand each other.
    In the work of building a new and better world, we all need to help each other. We in the United States should learn how to achieve domestic peace and tranquility. The Chinese people's control of the Huai River can inspire us to manage our own Missouri River.
    Despite the news blockade on the peace movement by newspapers and radio, despite the indictments and imprisonment of peace leaders, our peace organizations currently number more than three thousand. They include people from all walks of life, rich and poor, Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, Mexicans, Blacks, and Anglos, as well as Japanese and Puerto Ricans of American citizenship. The attempt to pass a bill in Congress to implement universal peacetime military training has been defeated by the protests of our churches, our mothers, our women's organizations, labor unions, and freelancers. The reason why we were able to achieve this major victory for peace this year is because parents are unwilling to have their young sons systematically trained as "executioners—the worst kind of executioners." The youth of America, feeling the pressure of war, unable to find work, unable to complete their studies, and unable to make any plans for their future, are taking a firm stand in favor of peace. As the government increasingly adopts fascist tactics and has no way to solve our problems, resistance is growing day by day in towns and villages. On August 20, 18,000 people gathered in New York to condemn the war and demand immediate peace. This month, public votes are being held in various states of the United States on the following issues:
    1. Immediately declare an "armistice" in Korea, and leave all remaining issues to be resolved at the peace conference that follows.
    2. Major powers should immediately consult to resolve all major differences.
    3. Prohibit the use of weapons of mass destruction, and reduce armaments under agreed and common control.
    The welcome given to the peace workers conducting this vote is extremely warm. We hate this war, we know it is unjust, and we want peace, immediate peace.

### 美国代表、艺术家  安妮泰·维尔科克斯夫人的发言（摘要）

    美国代表、艺术家
    安妮泰·维尔科克斯夫人的发言（摘要）
    我们作为百分之七十的美国人民的代表来到这里，这些人民在一次不具名的盖洛普民意测验中表示了他们真实的意见，投票赞成立即停止朝鲜战争。我们充分了解，作为一个民主国家的公民，如果我们不尽最大力量争取和平，我们就要对朝鲜战争中千百万男女和儿童的遭受屠杀负责任。我们来参加这次会议商讨制止这一屠杀的有效方法时，我们意识到在我们发言的时候，我们的飞机正在投下凝固汽油弹。我们要求亚洲及太平洋区域的兄弟姊妹们帮助我们制止重新武装日本及德国以及对东南亚人民的殖民压迫，以免再有新的朝鲜战争发生。
    我们代表我国大多数的人民，到这里来要求停止对巨济岛和济州岛的战俘的屠杀。在十月一日，当我们和平代表们在古老的北京参观这个自由民族富丽而光荣地庆祝他们的国庆节时，在济州岛上又有四十五个人由于竟敢欢乐地庆祝这一节日而遭屠杀。我们被一万个孩子快乐的歌声所鼓舞，我们的愤激情绪被他们的力量加强了，他们要谴责这种消灭别的民族及其工业和文化的罪恶阴谋。我们的武装部队毁坏别人赖以生存的谷仓和收成。他们把家园、舢舨、学校和马匹称为“军事目标”。我们的空军炸毁牛车。我们的海军击沉渔船。我们的兵士的父母们曾拒绝接受我国政府为这种“英雄行为”而奖给他们阵亡儿子们的勋章。
    我国大多数人民直到现在才开始知道我们使用凝固汽油弹的可怕事实。他们还不知道关于细菌战的事实。国际科学委员会调查团的报告和奥尼尔与克尼斯中尉的证词在美国还没有被广泛传布。政府知道我国人民对散布疾病一事是这样的深恶痛绝，以致最高军政当局和我国驻联合国代表们都矢口否认这种行动。在报纸上报道了伊纳克和奎恩中尉的供词之后，他们还在一直否认。各个和平组织将提供我国人民以研究证据和立定决心的机会。我们相信，他们的反应将是以不容忽视的响亮的声音要求各报发表国际科学委员会调查团的报告，并要求我们的政府答复委员会的指控，批准一九二五年的日内瓦议定书，并永远不再进行细菌战。
    大多数父母不会相信我们的孩子们会干下这种罪行。但事实是，在我们国内每天都在用私刑恐怖、警察暴行为社会的歧视来剥夺有色兄弟们的基本权利，这就使我们的青年们会在朝鲜干出这种残暴的罪行。
    今天，日本是进行朝鲜战争和东南亚战争的基地。我们的政府，刚刚释放了克虏伯，还偿了他八千万美元，又在扶助袭击珍珠港的那些日本战犯。如果日本被扶植成为军事强国，则我们不但有发生另一个朝鲜战争的危险，而且还有被驱向第三次世界大战的危险。我们和残暴的蒋介石的残余军队占领了台湾，就是我们准备第三次世界大战的一部分。为计划中的战争寻求原料和兵员，我们便加紧对拉丁美洲各国的干涉，对那些国家，除我们的经济剥削之外，又加上了缔结双边军事协定的更大的政治压力。和平运动的任务之一就是要使国内每一个人了解和认识到这些事实。
    毫无疑问，我们美国的报纸、无线电、电影和电视的造谣，歪曲和删改是造成我国人民思想混乱的主要原因。但此外我们还必须考虑到另一因素：就是有一种普遍的看法，认为如果将我国庞大扩军计划削减就要引起大量的失业和经济萧条。我国的和平运动正在处处强调和平并不一定带来经济萧条。我们高兴的是，从这次规模广泛并且十分实事求是的会议中，我们要把消息带回国去，向我国人民说美国的生产能力是有着和平的市场的。
    发展对亚洲的贸易和在国内举办迫切需要的公共事业建设，就能在可以预见的未来完全承受我国的生产能力。在亚洲，那些开辟自己的道路的人民和其他千百万正向同一方向迈进的人民已经创造了一个可以使几百万美国工人就业的迅速扩大的市场。
    最近我们已经有了贸易逆差，进口物资比我们输出的多，而且随着我国资源的日益消耗，我们就越要依靠别的国家。印度与拉丁美洲需要我们现在趸积起来或者加以销毁的全部粮食，它们是我们农产品的一个巨大的日益扩展的市场。这种粮食被官方称为“剩余粮食”。当国内外千百万儿童饥饿的时候，根本就没有剩余粮食这样的事。拿这些粮食去销毁，是敌视人类与敌视生命本身的一种罪恶行为。
    恢复和平的商业交往，就可以恢复文化的关系。人民是应该相互了解的。
    在建造新的更美好的世界的工作中，我们都需要彼此互相帮助。我们在美国应该学习如何获致国内的太平与安宁。中国人民对淮河的控制，可以激励我们去治理我们自己的密苏里河。
    尽管报纸和无线电都封锁关于和平运动的消息，尽管对和平领袖提起控诉并加以监禁，我们的和平组织目前为数已在三千以上。里面包括来自社会上各个不同部分的人们，有富人、穷人、天主教徒、新教徒和犹太人、墨西哥人、黑人和盎格鲁人，还有美国籍的日本人和波多黎各人。要在国会里通过实行和平时期普遍军训的法案的企图，已因我们的教会、我们的母亲们、我们的妇女组织、工会、和自由职业者群起抗议而被击退了。我们今年所以能够获得这次争取和平的重大胜利，是因为父母亲们不愿意他们年青的儿子被有系统地训练成“刽子手——无可再坏的刽子手”。美国的青年，感受到了战争的压力，不能够找到工作，不能完成学业，也不能对自己的前途作任何打算，他们都采取拥护和平的坚定立场。由于政府一天天变本加厉地采用法西斯的伎俩，而没有什么办法来解决我们的问题，人民的反抗也就在城镇和乡村里一天天地壮大。八月二十日，纽约有一万八千人集会，谴责战争，并要求立即实现和平。本月，美国各州都在进行关于下列各国问题的公民投票：
    一、立即在朝鲜宣布“停战”，一切剩下的问题留到接着召开的和平会议上去解决。
    二、各大国立即进行协商，以解决一切重大的分歧。
    三、禁止使用大规模屠杀的武器，在各方同意和共同管制下裁减军备。
    人们给予进行这次投票的和平工作者的欢迎是极其亲切的。我们憎恨这个战争，我们知道那是非正义的，我们要和平，立刻实现和平。
