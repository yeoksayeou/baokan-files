Celebrating the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

    The convening of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) is an event of great international significance. This congress will bring great encouragement and strength to the working people of the world and all peace-loving people. The Chinese people wholeheartedly and warmly congratulate the success of this congress.

    From their own personal experience, the Chinese people deeply understand that the existence and development of the great party of Lenin and Stalin and the great Soviet Union is the decisive condition for the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and construction. The Communist Party of China was founded under the direct influence of the great October Revolution and with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as its model. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese found Marxism through the introduction of the Russians. Before the October Revolution, the Chinese did not know Lenin and Stalin, nor did they know Marx and Engels. The October Revolution sent us Marxism-Leninism with a bang." (On the People's Democratic Dictatorship) Comrade Stalin's brilliant insights into the Chinese revolution are of immeasurable significance to the Communist Party of China in leading the Chinese people to achieve revolutionary victory. The victory of the Chinese revolution and the great achievements of the construction cause in the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China are all due to the correct application of the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and the correct application of the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in revolution and construction, according to China's specific conditions.

    The working people of the world and all peace-loving people are increasingly yearning for the peaceful and happy Soviet Union, and yearning for the bright future of mankind. They have placed unlimited hope on the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They all see the immense contributions made by the Soviet Union under the leadership of the great Stalin to all mankind. Especially after the Second World War, the contrasting facts between the old capitalist world and the new socialist world have educated every peace-loving and truth-loving person.

    The Second World War ended with the victory of the Soviet Union and peace-loving people of all countries over fascism and reactionary forces. The Soviet Union was the main force against fascism in the war that brought about the downfall of Hitler's Germany and Japanese militarism. In the West and East of the world, the collapse of Germany and Japan—the two centers of fascism—was a serious blow to the capitalist system. Before the Second World War, there were six imperialist powers in the world: Britain, France, the United States, Germany, Italy, and Japan. As a result of the Second World War, Germany, Italy, and Japan were defeated, and Britain and France were weakened, which further weakened the imperialist forces. The great victory of the Chinese revolution and the establishment of various new democratic countries have further consolidated and developed the forces of socialism and people's democracy. After the war, the workers' movement and democratic movement in various capitalist countries also surged up. In colonies and dependencies, the people's struggle against imperialist oppression and for national independence has been carried out more widely.

    As early as the May Day message in 1946, Comrade Stalin pointed out: "The masses of people who have been taught by the experience of war have realized that the fate of the country must not be handed over to reactionary rulers who pursue narrow class interests and greedy anti-people aims. It is precisely because of this that the people who are unwilling to live in the old way are taking the fate of their countries into their own hands, establishing democratic systems, and actively fighting against reactionary forces." The development of the international situation after the Second World War fully proves the correctness of Stalin's message. Now, the oppressed people all over the world, especially the oppressed nations of the East who have been under imperialist slavery for a long time, are striving a hundred times harder for their own national liberation.

    In the struggle of mankind towards a new world, the further consolidation and development of the Soviet Union, the powerful fortress of world peace and democracy under the leadership of the party of Lenin and Stalin, is of unparalleled importance. The draft directives on the Soviet Union's Five-Year Development Plan for 1951-1955 in the agenda of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union powerfully inspired the working people of the world and all peace-loving people.

    Under the leadership of the great party of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people originally planned to complete the third five-year plan from 1938 to 1942. Although German fascism attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, the third five-year plan was interrupted by the war in its fourth year of implementation. However, the Soviet Union on the eve of the Great Patriotic War was already a powerful industrialized country. Whether in terms of the speed of industrial development, the mechanization of agriculture, or in terms of production technology, the Soviet Union at that time had surpassed capitalist countries. The spiritual and political unity among the various nationalities that socialist Soviet Union had already achieved at that time, and the high level of material and spiritual life that the Soviet people had already achieved at that time, were even more unparalleled. After the victory of the Great Patriotic War from 1941 to 1945, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union immediately led the people to complete the fourth five-year plan from 1946 to 1950 ahead of schedule, so that the total industrial output of the Soviet Union at the end of 1950 exceeded the pre-war level of 1940 by 73 percent. Now, the goal of the Soviet Union's fifth five-year plan is to increase the level of Soviet industrial production by about 70 percent by the end of 1955 compared to 1950, so that the Soviet Union can move from a socialist society to a communist society.

    The entire content of this new five-year plan, from all aspects, shows that it is an extremely great plan for peaceful economic and cultural construction. No capitalist country can carry out large-scale peaceful construction like the Soviet Union. In capitalist countries, because the power is in the hands of the big bourgeoisie, this small group of capital giants greedily pursues profits, and those countries cannot escape the increasingly deepening crisis, and will inevitably lead to wars of mutual plunder. But the Soviet Union, because it has eliminated the exploiting classes, respects the rights of the people of all nationalities, and adheres to a peaceful foreign policy in international politics, can smoothly complete the great task of building a communist society in a peaceful environment.

    In order to realize such a great historical task, there must be a party that can guarantee the construction of communism. In the agenda of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the draft revision of the party constitution fully embodies the great doctrines of Lenin and Stalin on the nature and role of the party in the period of building communism, under the new political tasks and social conditions. After the exploitative system was completely eliminated, the exploiting classes were completely eliminated, and a socialist society was built, the nature of the party was clearly defined as "a voluntary combat alliance composed of ideologically consistent communists among the working class, working peasants, and working intellectuals." The role of a party of this nature is to "establish a communist society through the gradual transition from socialism to communism, gradually improve the material and cultural level of society, educate members of society with internationalism and the spirit of establishing fraternal relations with the working people of all countries, and extremely strengthen the active defense of the socialist motherland against the aggressive actions of its enemies." The historical task facing the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the greatest and most complex. Therefore, the draft revision of the party constitution develops the doctrines of Lenin and Stalin on party building, and pays attention everywhere to improving the party's combat effectiveness, enhancing the vanguard role of communist party members, and their initiative and creativity. The rules of party life stipulated in this draft revision of the party constitution are in fact a model of the new human life in communist society, and a standard of new social morality.

    Other important items on the agenda of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, including the reports of Comrade Malenkov and Comrade Moskatov, will undoubtedly have a major international impact. In particular, Comrade Stalin's historic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR", published on the eve of the opening of this congress, made the greatest and latest contribution to the science of Marxism-Leninism on society and the science of communist construction, and will illuminate the path of future life for all mankind.

    We are convinced that the experience summarized by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will surely enrich the theoretical arsenal of Marxism-Leninism, will surely enable the working people of the world and all peace-loving people to gain richer fighting experience, and will surely enable the cause of human progress to gain new and infinite strength.

### 庆贺苏联共产党第十九次代表大会

    庆贺苏联共产党第十九次代表大会
    苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会的召开，是具有伟大国际意义的事件。这个代表大会将给全世界劳动人民和一切爱好和平的人民带来伟大的鼓舞和力量。中国人民衷心地热烈祝贺这个代表大会的成功。
    中国人民从自己切身的经验中，深深地了解：伟大的列宁、斯大林的党和伟大的苏联的存在与发展，是中国人民的革命和建设事业能够取得胜利的决定性的条件。中国共产党是在伟大的十月革命的直接影响下并以苏联共产党为榜样而建立起来的。毛泽东同志说：“中国人找到马克思主义，是经过俄国人介绍的。在十月革命以前，中国人不但不知道列宁，斯大林，也不知道马克思，恩格斯。十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。”（论人民民主专政）斯大林同志关于中国革命的天才启示，对于中国共产党领导中国人民取得革命胜利具有无法估量的重大意义。中国革命的胜利以及中华人民共和国成立以后三年来的建设事业的巨大成就都是由于根据我国的具体情况，正确地运用马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说，正确地运用苏联共产党关于革命与建设的经验。
    全世界劳动人民和一切爱好和平的人民，正日益向往于和平幸福的苏联，向往于人类美好的未来。他们对于苏联共产党第十九次代表大会寄予了无限的希望。他们都看到在伟大斯大林领导下的苏联对于全人类所做的无比巨大的贡献。特别是经过了第二次世界大战以后，资本主义旧世界和社会主义新世界对比的事实，教育了每一个爱和平、爱真理的人们。
    第二次世界大战以苏联与爱好和平的各国人民战胜了法西斯主义和反动势力而结束。在使希特勒德国和日本军国主义归于覆没的战争中，苏联是反法西斯的主力。在世界的西方和东方，德国和日本——两个法西斯主义的策源地——的溃败是对资本主义体系的严重打击。第二次世界大战以前，世界上有英、法、美、德、意、日六个帝国主义强国，第二次世界大战的结果，德、意、日被打倒了，英、法被削弱了，这使帝国主义势力更加衰退。中国革命的伟大胜利，与各新民主主义国家的建立，使社会主义和人民民主的力量进一步巩固与发展了。战后各资本主义国家中的工人运动和民主运动也都高涨起来。在殖民地和附庸国中，人民反对帝国主义压迫、争取民族独立的斗争更广泛地开展了。
    斯大林同志早在一九四六年五一节的文告中，就已经指出：“饱受战争经验教训的人民群众了解到：决不能把国家的命运交给追求狭隘的阶级利益和贪婪的以反人民为目的的反动统治者。正是因为如此，不愿再过旧式生活的人民才把自己国家的命运握在自己的手里，建立着民主制度，并积极地进行着反对反动势力的斗争。”第二次世界大战以后的国际形势的发展，完全证明了斯大林这个文告的正确。现在，全世界被压迫的人民，特别是长期处于帝国主义奴役下的东方被压迫民族，正百倍努力为争取自己的民族解放而奋斗。
    在人类走向新世界的斗争中，列宁、斯大林的党领导下的世界和平民主的强大堡垒——苏联的更加巩固与发展，是具有无可比拟的重要性的。苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的议程中关于一九五一年——一九五五年苏联发展五年计划的指示草案，有力地鼓舞了全世界劳动人民与一切爱好和平的人民。
    苏联人民在伟大的列宁、斯大林的党领导之下，原定在一九三八年到一九四二年完成第三个五年计划。虽然德国法西斯在一九四一年六月进攻苏联，使第三个五年计划在执行的第四年因战争而中断。但是，卫国战争前夕的苏联已经是一个强大的工业化的国家了。无论在工业发展的速度方面，在农业机械化方面，以及在生产技术方面，当时的苏联都已经超过了资本主义国家。社会主义的苏联当时所已经达到的各民族之间精神上和政治上的一致、苏维埃人民当时所已经达到的物质生活和精神生活的高度水平更是无与伦比的。一九四一年到一九四五年的伟大卫国战争胜利之后，苏联共产党立即领导人民提前完成了从一九四六年到一九五○年的第四个五年计划，使苏联全部工业产量，在一九五○年底超过了战前一九四○年水平的百分之七十三。现在，苏联第五个五年计划的目标是要使苏联工业生产水平，在一九五五年底比一九五○年再提高约百分之七十，使苏联由社会主义社会向共产主义社会迈进。
    这个新的五年计划的全部内容，从各方面都显示出来是极其伟大的和平的经济和文化建设的计划。任何一个资本主义国家决不能像苏联这样进行大规模的和平建设。在资本主义各国，由于政权是在大资产阶级手里，这批人数很少的资本巨头贪得无餍地追求利润，那些国家就不能逃避日益深刻的危机，并且将因此而不可避免地引起他们相互掠夺的战争。但是苏联，因为消灭了剥削阶级，各民族人民的权利得到尊重，在国际政治中坚持和平的外交政策，它就能够在和平环境中顺利地完成建设共产主义社会的伟大任务。
    为了实现这样伟大的历史任务，必须有一个能够保证共产主义建设的党。苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的议程中，关于党章的修正草案，在新的政治任务和社会条件下，充分体现了列宁和斯大林同志关于在建设共产主义时期的党的性质与作用的伟大学说。在完全消灭了剥削制度、完全消灭了剥削阶级、建成了社会主义社会之后，党的性质就被明确地规定为“工人阶级、劳动农民和劳动知识分子中思想一致的共产主义者所组成的自愿的战斗联盟”了。这样性质的党的作用，则是“通过由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的途径来建立共产主义社会，逐步提高社会的物质和文化水平，用国际主义及与各国劳动人民建立兄弟联系的精神来教育社会成员，极度加强社会主义祖国对其敌人侵略行动的积极防御”。苏联共产党面临的历史任务是最伟大的、最复杂的。因此党章修正草案，发挥列宁、斯大林关于建党的学说，处处都注意提高党的战斗力，提高共产党员的先锋作用和积极主动的创造精神。这个党章修正草案中所规定的党内生活的规律，实际上乃是共产主义社会中的人类新生活的典范，是一种新的社会道德的准绳。
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的其他重要议程，包括马林科夫同志和摩斯卡托夫同志的报告，无疑地都将发生重大的国际影响。特别是斯大林同志在这个代表大会开幕前夕发表的“苏联社会主义经济问题”的历史性的著作，对于马克思、列宁主义关于社会的科学、关于共产主义建设的科学，作了最大的和最新的贡献，将照耀着全人类未来生活的道路。
    我们确信，苏联共产党第十九次代表大会所总结的经验，一定会使马克思、列宁主义的理论武库更加丰富起来，一定会使全世界的劳动人民和一切爱好和平的人民获得更丰富的斗争经验，一定会使人类的进步事业获得新的无穷的力量。
