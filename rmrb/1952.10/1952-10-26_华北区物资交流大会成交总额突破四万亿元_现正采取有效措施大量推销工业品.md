    The North China region's second Material Exchange Conference of this year has been held in Tianjin since its opening on September 27th. Under the leadership of the North China Administrative Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and with the strong support of major administrative regions, provinces, and cities, and due to the joint efforts of public and private economic forces, the total transaction volume of the conference has exceeded four trillion yuan as of October 23rd. The conference has adopted effective measures to vigorously promote industrial products, and the proportion of industrial product transactions in the total transaction volume is now rapidly increasing.
    The tasks of this conference are: to vigorously promote industrial and handicraft products, purchase agricultural, sideline, native, and special products, especially to promote the sale of stockpiled daily-use industrial products and a wide variety of small native products that account for a large proportion of farmers' income, develop domestic sales, and organize exports; to further strengthen the planning of production and sales by exchanging production and sales information among trade delegations from various regions; to inspect the implementation of past trade contracts and urge their fulfillment; and to educate state-owned trade cadres, cooperative cadres, and private industrialists and merchants to establish new business ideas and business practices. The conference pays close attention to strengthening material exchanges between minority areas and disaster areas to help them solve difficulties and develop production.
    The conference invited trade delegations from major administrative regions and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to Tianjin to participate in transactions. In addition to organizing trade delegations at the provincial and municipal levels, the five provinces and two cities of North China also organized many small trade delegations at the level of special districts, counties, and towns to participate in transactions. Each delegation included representatives from state-owned trade organizations, cooperatives, and private industrialists and merchants.
    From the afternoon of September 27th to September 30th, the total transaction volume reached 1.2 trillion yuan.
    Since the 3rd of this month, trade delegations from major administrative regions have successively arrived to participate in transactions. However, due to the lack of understanding of the supply and demand situation between regions, the progress of transactions was relatively slow. To change this situation, the conference carried out a series of tasks: inviting representatives from trade delegations from various regions to hold forums, exchange opinions, and hold professional meetings focusing on various slow-selling commodities, vigorously assisting trade delegations in selling what they wanted to sell and buying what they wanted to buy. From then on, the transaction situation at the conference began to become active. However, during this period, agricultural, sideline, native, and special products still accounted for the majority of the transactions, and industrial products, especially slow-selling substandard products and "unpopular goods," were still traded in small quantities. The main reasons for this phenomenon are: First, many trade delegations were eager to sell goods but unwilling to buy goods freely; some insisted that the other party must simultaneously purchase their goods when purchasing from them, resulting in certain "stalemates" in transactions. Second, some people still held high price ideas, and some had the mentality of waiting for industrial products to fall in price, so they hesitated and watched in transactions. Third, many people still competed to buy "famous brands" and were unwilling to buy non-"famous brands." Fourth, the purchase and sales plans formulated by some delegations were too conservative, and the purchasing power of the masses was underestimated. For example, the Hebei Provincial Trade Delegation initially formulated a plan to purchase only 200 billion yuan of industrial products, with an average purchasing power of only 625 yuan per person in the province, equivalent to 1.25 taels of cotton.
    Based on the above situation, the conference carried out the following work: First, it mobilized trade delegations from various regions to re-examine and supplement purchase and sales plans, making the plans more specific and realistic. The Hebei Provincial Trade Delegation alone revised its plan to purchase industrial products from 200 billion yuan to 400 billion yuan. Relevant state-owned trade companies in Tianjin clarified their inventory and proposed specific figures for promoting sales. Relevant systems also focused on criticizing conservative thinking in management through various meetings. Second, it strengthened organizational leadership and adopted the method of collective office work by the heads of delegations to carry out centralized transactions. Responsible comrades of the conference personally oversaw the transactions. Third, relevant state-owned trade companies in Tianjin adjusted the listed prices of 102 kinds of industrial products on the 13th of this month, stabilizing the mood of purchasers. At the same time, appropriate methods such as spot goods with payment on delivery and futures with payment on delivery were adopted in the transaction to solve the difficulties of some buyers lacking cash.
    After implementing the above measures, the transaction volume increased day by day. In particular, starting from the 16th of this month, trade delegations from various regions enthusiastically responded to the conference's call to launch a "Transaction Week" to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and commemorate the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the Korean War, setting off a transaction climax. Trade delegations from various regions were able to buy and sell in large quantities and implement the transaction policy of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, mutual assistance between regions, consideration of both public and private interests, and consideration of both large and small interests. They helped each other solve problems between public and private sectors and between regions, meeting the purchasing and sales requirements of both parties, not only expanding the exchange of native products but also transacting a large number of industrial products. According to statistics: of the total transaction volume from September 27th to October 18th, industrial products accounted for 48.78 percent; while in the Transaction Week, from October 16th to 18th, the proportion of industrial product transaction volume had reached 70.18 percent. As of the 23rd, the total transaction volume of the conference had exceeded four trillion yuan.

    华北区物资交流大会成交总额突破四万亿元
    现正采取有效措施大量推销工业品
    华北区本年度第二届物资交流大会自九月二十七日在天津开幕以来，在中央人民政府政务院华北行政委员会的领导和各大行政区、省、市的有力支持下，由于公私经济力量共同努力，截至十月二十三日止，大会成交总额已突破四万亿元。大会采取有效措施，大力推销工业品，现在工业品的成交量在总成交额中的比重已迅速增大。
    这次大会的任务是：大力推销工业品和手工业品，收购农业、副业、土产和特产品，特别是推销积压的日用工业品和占广大农民收入比重很大的种类繁多的小土产品，开展内销业务，并组织出口；通过各地贸易代表团互相交换产销情况，进一步加强产销的计划性；检查过去订立的贸易合同的执行情况，并督促其实现；教育国营贸易干部、合作社干部和私营工商业者，树立新的经营思想和经营作风。大会十分注意加强少数民族地区和灾区的物资交流，以帮助其解决困难，发展生产。
    大会邀请了各大行政区和内蒙古自治区的贸易代表团到天津参加交易，华北五省二市除以省、市为单位组织了贸易代表团外，并以专区、县、市镇为单位，组织了许多小型贸易代表团参加交易。各代表团都有国营贸易机关、合作社和私营工商业者参加。
    大会自九月二十七日下午至九月三十日为止，交易总额达一万二千亿元。
    自本月三日起，各大行政区的贸易代表团都陆续到会参加交易。但由于各个贸易代表团对于地区间供需情况了解不够，交易进度比较迟缓。为了改变这一情况，大会进行了一系列的工作：邀请各地贸易代表团代表举行座谈，交换意见，并以各种滞销商品为主，举行专业会议，大力协助各贸易代表团把想卖的东西卖出，把想买的东西买到。从此，大会的交易情况开始活跃起来。但这一期间成交的商品仍以农业、副业和土、特产品占大宗，工业品特别是滞销的残次品和“冷背货”成交还少。造成这一现象的主要原因是：第一、许多贸易代表团都急于销货，但不肯放手买货；有的向对方购货时，强调对方必须同时收购自己的货品，以致形成了交易中某些“顶牛”的现象。第二、某些人还存在着高价思想，也有的抱着等待工业品落价的心理，因而在交易上观望、犹豫。第三、有不少人仍然争购“名牌货”，不愿买非“名牌货”。第四、某些代表团订立的购销计划偏重保守，对群众的购买力估计不足。如河北省贸易代表团开始只订立了二百亿元的购进工业品计划，全省每人购买力平均仅为六百二十五元，折合棉花一两二钱半。
    根据以上情况，大会进行了如下工作：一、动员各地贸易代表团重新审查和补充购销计划，使计划比较具体并切合实际。仅河北省贸易代表团即将购进工业品的计划从二百亿元修订为四千亿元。天津市各有关国营贸易公司弄清了家底，提出了推销商品的具体数字。各有关系统并通过各种会议，着重批判了经营上的保守思想。二、加强组织领导，采用团长集体办公的方式，进行集中成交。由大会负责同志亲自掌握成交。三、由天津市有关国营贸易公司在本月十三日调整了一百零二种工业品的牌价，稳定了购货者的情绪。同时在交易中适当地采取了现货期款、期货期款等方式，解决了某些买方缺乏现金的困难。
    实行了上述办法以后，成交额逐日提高。特别是从本月十六日起，各地贸易代表团热烈响应大会号召，为庆祝亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议胜利闭幕和纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战两周年展开“交易周”，掀起了交易高潮。各地贸易代表团都能大买大卖，并贯彻城乡互助、地区互助、公私兼顾、大小兼顾的交易方针，公私之间、地区之间相互帮助解决问题，满足双方购销要求，不但扩大了土产交流，而且成交了大量工业品。据统计：从九月二十七日至十月十八日的总成交额中，工业品占百分之四十八点七八；而在交易周中，从十月十六日至十八日，工业品成交额所占比重已达到百分之七十点一八。截至二十三日为止，大会成交总额已突破四万亿元。
