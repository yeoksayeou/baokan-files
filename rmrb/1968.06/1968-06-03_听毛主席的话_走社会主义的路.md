I am a new soldier who enlisted this year, and my fellow villager, Comrade Men He, is my neighbor. With great respect, I read through Comrade Men He's heroic deeds in one breath and was deeply moved by his boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Comrade Men He's life is one of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and a life of bravely defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. When I was at home, I saw and heard many stories about Comrade Men He in this regard.

In 1955, the people of the entire nation enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call and launched a magnificent wave of agricultural collectivization. Men He was very happy. However, when he learned from a letter that his mother was reluctant to contribute a large mule, which she had obtained during land reform, to the collective, he was very anxious. He immediately wrote a letter home, helping his mother recall the bitterness and sweetness of the past, explaining the superiority of the collective path and the harm of individual farming. He told his mother to follow Chairman Mao's words and not to be deceived by class enemies. In his letter, he said to his mother: Chairman Mao liberated our entire family and millions of poor and suffering people. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no today for us. Now, Chairman Mao has shown us poor people the bright path of socialism. If we do not walk it, who will? If we do not listen to Chairman Mao's words, who will? With Men He's help, his mother happily led the mule into the collective. Following Men He's parents, all the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village launched a wave of establishing cooperatives.

Every time Men He returned home, he would work diligently with the community members. During work, he enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought, helping the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village firmly walk the socialist path. In 1961, when the Chinese Khrushchev spread the "three freedoms and one contract" black wind, our village was also affected. Men He returned home and actively propagated the benefits of walking the socialist path, educating everyone to care about collective production. He also personally wrote a couplet and posted it at his door. The upper line reads "Chairman Mao is the closest," and the lower line reads "Socialism is the best." The poor and lower-middle peasant community members saw it and said: Men He has a high level of proletarian awareness and is the most resolute in following Chairman Mao to walk the socialist path.

    听毛主席的话　走社会主义的路
    八五一四部队新战士　李根生
    我是今年入伍的新战士，和门合同志是同村对门的老乡。我怀着十分崇敬的心情，一口气看完了门合同志的英雄事迹，深深被门合同志无限忠于毛主席革命路线的崇高品质所感动。
    门合同志的一生，是无限热爱、无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的一生，是勇敢捍卫毛主席革命路线的一生。我在家时，曾看到和听说过门合同志不少这方面的故事。
    一九五五年，全国人民热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，掀起了轰轰烈烈的农业合作化高潮。门合非常高兴。但是，当他从家信中知道母亲有些舍不得把土改时分得的一头大骡子入社时，心里十分着急，马上给家里写信，帮助母亲忆苦思甜，说明走集体化道路的优越性和单干的害处，告诉母亲要听毛主席的话，不要上阶级敌人的当。他在信中对母亲说：毛主席解放了咱全家和千千万万受苦受难的穷人。没有毛主席就没有咱们的今天。现在毛主席给咱们穷人指出了社会主义的光明大道，咱们不走，谁走？毛主席的话，咱们不听，谁听？经过门合同志的帮助，他母亲牵着大骡子欢欢喜喜地入了社。在门合父母的带动下，全村贫下中农掀起了大办合作社的热潮。
    门合同志每次探家，都朴朴实实地和社员一起参加劳动。劳动中，他热情宣传毛泽东思想，帮助贫下中农乡亲们坚定地走社会主义道路。一九六一年，中国赫鲁晓夫刮起了“三自一包”黑风，我们村也受到了影响。门合同志回到家里，积极宣传走社会主义道路的好处，教育大家要关心集体生产。他还亲自写了一副对联，贴在家门口，上联是“毛主席最亲”，下联是“社会主义最好”。贫下中农社员看了，都说：门合的无产阶级觉悟高，跟毛主席走社会主义道路最坚决。
