Revolutionary workers on Zhejiang's industrial frontline are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, intensifying class struggle, and promoting a great situation. The total industrial output value of the province has been rising month by month in the first four months of this year, and the daily production level has further increased since May. The industrial products with the largest growth rate are heavy industrial products and products supporting agriculture. Steel, cement, caustic soda, ammonia, and other products have increased by 30% to more than 100% compared to April. The production of chemical fertilizers in April increased by 93% compared to March, agricultural sprayers increased by more than 100%, and agricultural support products such as diesel engines, water pumps, small hydroelectric generators, and electric motors have also shown significant growth.

In the process of seizing the revolution and promoting production, all revolutionary workers have put learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the forefront of all work. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been widely established in factories, mines, and enterprises across the province. Factories and enterprises in Hangzhou City have held nearly 10,000 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 300,000 workers participating in the study. Through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions have been further implemented, thus consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and promoting the rapid realization of the revolutionary three-in-one combination at the grassroots level. More than 90% of the over 100 large factories, mines, and enterprises in the Jinhua area have quickly established revolutionary committees through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

Under the leadership of revolutionary committees at all levels, revolutionary workers have, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launched a fierce attack on class enemies. Many factories, mines, workshops, and teams have set up battlefields for revolutionary criticism, with people criticizing and writing to expose and criticize the entire set of counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang. At the same time, they have unearthed a handful of hidden class enemies, smashed their evil plots to sabotage the revolution and production, and promoted the development of the revolution and production. The revolutionary committee of Hangzhou Agricultural Chemical Factory organized revolutionary workers to study Chairman Mao's statements on class and class struggle, carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism, launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, smashed the anarchist and counter-revolutionary economism evil winds stirred up by class enemies, and made the revolutionary situation in the entire factory better and better. Production has been rising steadily, and the production of chemical fertilizers in May increased by 18% compared to April. Many factories and enterprises in Jinhua, Jiaxing, Shaoxing, and Ningbo have, through intensifying class struggle and carrying out in-depth revolutionary criticism, seen production improve day by day, with output increasing significantly. The revolutionary workers of agricultural machinery factories in these regions have, through criticism, further established the idea of serving agriculture, and the progress of repairing and manufacturing agricultural machinery has been greatly accelerated. All the machine and electric irrigation equipment that needs to be repaired in the province has been repaired in time, ensuring the need for farmland irrigation.

Revolutionary workers on the industrial frontline across the province, with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, regard the firm implementation of Chairman Mao's "seize the revolution, promote production" policy as a practical action of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. With sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm, they have thrown themselves into the production struggle and scientific experiments. Technical innovation projects have continuously emerged across the province, and many factories have successively introduced new products and new technologies into production.
