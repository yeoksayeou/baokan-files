The Revolutionary Committee of the Qinchuang Machine Tool Factory in Xi'an, guided by the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, leads all revolutionary workers in the factory to intensify class struggle, advance victoriously, consolidate the proletarian revolutionary power, and promote production development.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, is there still class struggle? Is the focus of class struggle still on the struggle for power? The Revolutionary Committee of the Qinchuang Machine Tool Factory discussed this issue seriously based on the active thoughts of some comrades. With the help of the PLA propaganda team stationed in the factory to promote Mao Zedong Thought, the committee members and the proletarian revolutionary faction studied together the "May 16th Circular" drafted by Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, as well as Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They also conducted thorough investigations and research on the class struggle situation within the factory and analyzed the class struggle situation in the factory. Chairman Mao's wise instructions and the vivid reality of class struggle in the factory made the committee members and the proletarian revolutionary faction realize that a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and other class enemies do not accept their defeat. They are always trying to reverse the verdict and engage in counter-revolutionary restoration activities, attempting to overthrow the newly established proletarian revolutionary power. After the proletarian revolutionary faction won the struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, they still face a struggle to consolidate the revolutionary committee. The focus of the struggle should still be on the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, such as China's Khrushchev, as well as hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries.

This study and discussion clarified the direction of work after the establishment of the committee amidst numerous tasks; it also clarified the combat mission of continuing the struggle for all revolutionary workers in the factory in the face of a decisive victory. All revolutionary workers in the factory, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launched a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism and launched a fierce attack on the enemies of the proletariat. For a period, a counter-revolutionary wind of economism blew through the factory. The factory's revolutionary committee mobilized the revolutionary masses to launch a face-to-face criticism and struggle against a handful of class enemies. The more they criticized, the more enthusiastic they became, and the higher their class consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle became. The traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who collaborated with a handful of capitalist roaders within the factory to overthrow the revolutionary committee were also exposed one by one. In this struggle to consolidate the newly established proletarian revolutionary power, all revolutionary workers in the factory deeply felt that in the face of the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and throughout the entire socialist transition period, they must always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching: "Never forget class struggle." They must also remember Comrade Lin Biao's extremely important instruction: always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always emphasize politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches: believe in the majority of cadres and the masses; this is the most fundamental principle. The Revolutionary Committee of the Qinchuang Machine Tool Factory understands that only by following Chairman Mao's teachings can they unite the majority of cadres and the masses, and always direct the struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in this region and unit. They say, the more united the masses are, the harder they hit the enemy; the harder they hit the enemy, the more united the masses become.

Now, a large number of revolutionary cadres have stepped forward to shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production. The enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses for grasping revolution and promoting production is increasing, the authority of the revolutionary committee is increasing, and the revolutionary and production situation of the entire factory is getting better and better.

    秦川机床厂革委会带领全厂革命职工狠抓阶级斗争
    革委会更加巩固　生产形势越来越好
    据新华社西安电　西安秦川机床厂革命委员会，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，带领全厂革命职工狠抓阶级斗争，乘胜前进，巩固了无产阶级革命政权，推动了生产的发展。
    无产阶级革命派掌权以后，还有没有阶级斗争？阶级斗争的焦点是不是仍然集中在争夺政权的问题上？秦川机床厂革命委员会根据一部分同志的活思想，对这个问题进行了认真的讨论。在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，革委会成员和无产阶级革命派一起，共同学习了毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》和毛主席的一系列最新指示，并且认真调查研究了厂内阶级斗争的情况，分析了本厂阶级斗争的形势。毛主席的英明指示，工厂里活生生的阶级斗争现实，使革委会成员和无产阶级革命派认识到，党内一小撮走资派等阶级敌人，并不甘心于他们的失败，他们时刻都在妄想翻案，进行反革命复辟活动，妄图颠覆新生的无产阶级革命政权。无产阶级革命派取得向党内一小撮走资派夺权斗争的胜利以后，仍然面临着一场巩固革命委员会的斗争。斗争的矛头仍然应该指向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派，以及隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子。
    这次学习和讨论，使革委会成立以后，在千头万绪的工作中明确了方向；使全厂革命职工在取得决定性胜利的大好形势下明确了继续斗争的战斗任务。全厂革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入持久地开展革命大批判，向无产阶级的敌人发动了猛烈进攻。有一个时期，工厂里曾经刮起一阵反革命经济主义妖风。厂革委会发动革命群众对一小撮阶级敌人展开了面对面的批判斗争。他们越批斗志越旺，越批阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟越高。混在群众中配合厂内一小撮走资派颠覆革委会的叛徒、特务、反革命分子，也一个个地被挖了出来。在这场巩固新生的无产阶级革命政权的斗争中，全厂革命职工深深体会到，在无产阶级文化大革命已经取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，在整个社会主义过渡时期，都要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导。要牢记林副主席极重要的指示：念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    毛主席教导说：相信大多数干部和群众，这是最基本的一条。秦川机床厂革委会体会到，只有遵照毛主席的教导，才能团结绝大多数干部和群众，把斗争矛头始终指向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区、本单位的代理人。他们说，群众团结越紧，打击敌人越狠；打击敌人越狠，群众团结越紧。
    现在，大批革命干部站出来挑起了革命和生产两副重担。广大革命群众抓革命促生产的劲头愈来愈大，革命委员会的威信愈来愈高，全厂革命和生产的形势愈来愈好。
