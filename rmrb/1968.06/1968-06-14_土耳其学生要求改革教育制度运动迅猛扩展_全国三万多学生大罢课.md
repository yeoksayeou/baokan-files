The strike by Turkish students demanding educational reform, which began on the 10th, has spread from the capital Ankara to cities such as Istanbul and Izmir. By the 12th, the number of students participating in the strike nationwide had increased to over 30,000.

The students from the Faculty of Literature and Law at Ankara University, who initiated the strike, continued to occupy their faculty buildings, insisting on reforming the educational system. On the 12th, students marched to the Ministry of Education, demanding the resignation of the Minister of Education. On the same day, the administration of Ankara University, in response to the student strike, announced the closure of the Faculty of Law.

Students from the Faculty of Law at Istanbul University declared a strike on the 12th. The striking students formed an "Occupation Committee," took over the Faculty of Law building and the university's telephone exchange, and expelled the dean from his office. The striking students also demonstrated outside the office of the university president, chanting slogans such as "Reform the educational system" and "President resign." When the president attempted to address the students, they surrounded him. He was eventually rescued by the police.

To handle the situation, the governor of Istanbul has canceled all police leave.

Students from the agricultural colleges in Ankara, Erzurum, and Izmir also began striking on the 11th.

    新华社十三日讯　安卡拉消息：在十日开始的土耳其学生要求改革教育制度的罢课，已经从首都安卡拉扩展到伊斯坦布尔、伊兹密尔等几个城市。到十二日，全国参加罢课的学生已增加到三万多人。
    首先发动这次罢课的安卡拉大学的文学院和法学院的学生，继续占领他们学院的大楼，坚持要求改革教育制度。十二日，学生列队前往教育部，要求教育部长辞职。当天，安卡拉大学学校当局为了对付学生罢课，竟宣布关闭法学院。
    伊斯坦布尔大学法学院的学生，在十二日宣布罢课。罢课的学生成立了“占领委员会”，占领了法学院的大楼和大学的电话总机室，并把院长从办公室里赶出去。罢课的学生还到大学校长的办公室外面示威，高呼“改革教育制度”和“校长辞职”的口号。当校长试图向学生发表讲话时，学生把他围困起来。最后才由警察把他解救出去。
    为了应付局势，伊斯坦布尔省长已宣布取消警察的一切休假。
    安卡拉、埃尔佐鲁姆和伊兹密尔农学院的学生也从十一日开始罢课。
