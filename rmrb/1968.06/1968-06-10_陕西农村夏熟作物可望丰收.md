Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's great policy of "seize the revolution and promote production" and his latest instructions, the revolutionary and production situations in the vast rural areas of Shaanxi Province are getting better and better. The summer crops in over 30 million mu of farmland across the province are growing well. Among them, the main summer harvest crop, wheat, is growing vigorously, presenting a scene of bountiful harvest. The early-maturing wheat regions in southern Shaanxi and the main wheat-producing areas in the Guanzhong Plain have already begun harvesting.

This year, the summer crops in the vast rural areas of Shaanxi Province are growing well and are expected to be bountiful. This is a fruitful result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Since last winter, the entire province's rural areas, under the leadership of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, have held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 55 million cadres and masses participating in the study. The movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought is deeply developing, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has deeply entered the hearts of the people.

The great leader Chairman Mao instructs that the commune peasants "must also criticize the bourgeoisie." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the vast poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the rural areas of Shaanxi Province are firmly grasping the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, launching relentless attacks on the class enemies, and deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation. They are exposing and criticizing the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Northwest and Shaanxi who attempt to restore capitalism, eliminating the poison of their counter-revolutionary revisionism, and at the same time, they have unearthed a batch of hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, smashing the evil plots of a small handful of class enemies to sabotage production. The production enthusiasm of the vast community members is increasingly high, and the spring plowing and summer field management work are done solidly, with summer harvest preparations done quickly and well.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Every year, we must grasp the three tasks of harvesting, storing, and consuming (harvesting, storing, and consuming) very tightly." Under the shining guidance of Chairman Mao's instructions, the vast poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the rural areas of Shaanxi Province are now enthusiastically launching a wave of seizing the revolution, promoting production, and promoting the summer harvest. The Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently held a meeting with representatives from prefectures, counties (cities), and communes to discuss and analyze the excellent situation of revolution and production in the rural areas.

The Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Xi'an Municipal Revolutionary Committee have also dispatched over 100,000 revolutionary teachers and students and revolutionary cadres from provincial and municipal organs, Xi'an's colleges and universities, and secondary schools to form large propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought. They have gone deep into the vast rural areas to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the vast community members, study Chairman Mao's works with the masses, participate in labor, and support the summer harvest.

    陕西农村夏熟作物可望丰收
    据新华社西安八日电  在伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针和一系列最新指示指引下，陕西省广大农村革命和生产形势越来越好。全省农村三千多万亩夏田农作物普遍生长良好。其中主要夏收作物小麦，生长茁壮，一片丰收景象。陕南小麦早熟地区和小麦主要产区的关中平原，都已开始收割。
    今年陕西省广大农村夏收作物长势大好，可望丰收，这是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。自去冬以来，全省农村在贫下中农和革命干部的带动下，举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的干部和群众达五百五十万人。活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动正深入开展，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线已深入人心。
    伟大领袖毛主席指示说，公社农民“也要批判资产阶级”。遵循毛主席的教导，陕西省农村的广大贫下中农和革命干部，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，不停顿地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，深入持久地开展革命大批判。大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西北和陕西代理人妄图复辟资本主义的罪行，肃清他们散布的反革命修正主义流毒，同时挖出了一批隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人破坏生产的罪恶阴谋。广大社员生产积极性越来越高，春耕生产和夏田管理工作做得扎扎实实，夏收准备工作做得又快又好。
    毛主席教导我们：“每年一定要把收割、保管、吃用三件事（收、管、吃）抓得很紧很紧。”在毛主席指示的光辉照耀下，当前陕西广大农村的贫下中农和革命干部，正在热烈地展开抓革命、促生产、促夏收的热潮。陕西省革命委员会最近召开有专区、县（市）、公社代表参加的夏收、夏管、夏种工作会议，研究分析了农村革命和生产的大好形势。
    陕西省革命委员会和西安市革命委员会还从省市级机关、西安各大专院校、中等学校抽调十多万革命师生和革命干部，组成大批毛泽东思想宣传队，深入广大农村，向广大社员群众宣传毛泽东思想，同群众一起学习毛主席著作，参加劳动，支援夏收。
