At the moment when our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is approaching complete victory, President Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania has traveled thousands of miles to visit our country, which is a great encouragement and support to the Chinese people. We believe that President Nyerere's visit will certainly make new contributions to further strengthening the fighting friendship between our two peoples and the unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa in their struggle against imperialism.

Under the leadership of President Nyerere, the United Republic of Tanzania has firmly defended its national independence and sovereignty, actively supported the African national liberation movement, and won the respect of the African people. Inspired by the Arusha Declaration, the Tanzanian people have adopted the policy of self-reliance and are striving to build their own country, achieving remarkable results. We sincerely wish the Tanzanian people continuous victories in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism and in their pursuit of independent development.

At present, the revolutionary situation of the people of the world against imperialism is excellent.

In Africa, the people of Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Zimbabwe, and South Africa are launching fierce and sustained attacks on the strongholds of colonialism and racism. The struggle of the Arab peoples against American and Israeli aggressors is deepening. Although the African and Arab peoples may still encounter twists and turns and difficulties on their forward march, as long as they persist in their struggle, they will surely achieve final victory.

The 31 million heroic Vietnamese people are inflicting heavy blows on the American aggressors in their war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The U.S. imperialists are intensifying their aggression while at the same time hatching plots for talks, attempting to gain at the negotiating table what they cannot get on the battlefield. This is unacceptable to the Vietnamese people. All the Vietnamese people are responding to the call of their great leader, President Ho Chi Minh, to unite more closely and persist in a protracted war to achieve the great goal of thoroughly defeating the U.S. aggressors and liberating the whole of Vietnam.

While the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing, a great storm of revolutionary mass movements has also risen in Europe and North America, the heartland of the capitalist world. This storm signifies the new awakening of the masses of the people in the Western countries and a new stage in their revolutionary struggle, striking heavily at the decaying and collapsing old world headed by U.S. imperialism.

The development of the international situation has never been as favorable to the peoples of the world as it is today.

Recently, the United States and the Soviet Union have colluded to manipulate the United Nations General Assembly into forcibly adopting the so-called "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons." This is a new plot and deception by them against the peoples of the world. They are attempting to use this move to consolidate their nuclear monopoly, turn non-nuclear countries into their "protectorates," and promote a new type of nuclear colonialism.

However, their plot has been met with resistance and opposition from many countries from the very beginning. Here, it is particularly worth mentioning that Tanzania has strongly exposed the neo-colonialist nature of this treaty and resolutely opposed it. We admire Tanzania's spirit of fearlessness and justice.

Our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong has long pointed out: "The atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs the U.S. imperialists have are paper tigers, they cannot possibly scare all people who do not want to be enslaved." Nuclear weapons cannot stop the great tide of the world's peoples' anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle. Nuclear weapons cannot save the lives of imperialists, nor can they save the lives of modern revisionists.

From the very first day of developing nuclear weapons, China has been striving to break the nuclear monopoly of the big powers, achieve equal status for all countries, big or small, in the world, and ultimately eliminate nuclear weapons. We firmly advocate the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and have repeatedly declared that we will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. We believe that our goal will certainly be achieved.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, has, after two years of tumultuous struggle, now entered the stage of approaching complete victory. President Nyerer has said that the Chinese Cultural Revolution is "to continue to maintain the revolutionary spirit and goals." This is a praise and support for our Cultural Revolution. We will not disappoint the expectations of our friends. Proletarian internationalism is the highest guiding principle of our foreign policy. We will continue to develop relations with friendly countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We will unite more closely with the peoples of the world to carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys through to the end, and to carry the struggle against modern revisionism through to the end!

    在欢迎坦桑尼亚联合共和国总统尼雷尔的宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话（摘要）
    新华社十八日讯　周恩来总理在欢迎坦桑尼亚联合共和国总统尼雷尔的宴会上的讲话（摘要）
    正当我国无产阶级文化大革命进入夺取全面胜利的时刻，尼雷尔总统阁下，不远万里，来到我国，进行友好访问，这是对中国人民的巨大支持和鼓舞。我们相信，总统阁下的这次访问，必然会对进一步加强我们两国人民之间的战斗友谊和亚非人民的团结反帝事业，作出新的贡献。
    坦桑尼亚联合共和国在尼雷尔总统的领导下，坚决捍卫自己的民族独立和国家主权，积极支援非洲民族解放运动，赢得了非洲人民的尊敬。坦桑尼亚人民在《阿鲁沙宣言》的鼓舞下，采取自力更生的方针，努力建设自己的国家，取得了显著的成就。我们衷心祝愿坦桑尼亚人民在反帝反殖、独立发展的道路上，不断地胜利前进。
    目前，全世界人民的反帝革命形势一片大好。
    在非洲，莫三鼻给、安哥拉、几内亚（比绍）、津巴布韦和南非人民正在向殖民主义和种族主义的顽固堡垒发动猛烈、持久的进攻。阿拉伯各国人民反对美、以侵略者的斗争越来越深入。尽管在非洲和阿拉伯各国人民前进的道路上不免还会出现曲折和困难，但是，只要坚持斗争，就一定能够取得最后胜利。
    三千一百万英雄的越南人民，在抗美救国战争中沉重地打击了美国侵略者。美帝国主义一面强化侵略战争，一面大搞和谈阴谋，妄图在谈判桌上得到它在战场上得不到的东西。这是越南人民所不能答应的。全体越南人民正在响应其伟大领袖胡志明主席的号召，更加紧密地团结起来，坚持持久战争，为彻底打败美国侵略者、解放整个越南的伟大目标而英勇战斗。
    在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反帝反殖斗争蓬勃发展的同时，在欧洲和北美这个资本主义世界的心脏地区，最近也兴起了革命群众运动的伟大风暴。这场风暴标志着西方国家人民群众的新觉醒和革命斗争的新阶段，猛烈地冲击着以美帝国主义为首的腐朽没落的旧世界。
    国际形势的发展，从来没有象今天这样有利于世界各国人民。
    最近美苏勾结在一起，操纵联合国大会强行通过所谓“防止核扩散条约”。这是它们反对世界各国人民的一个新的大阴谋、大骗局。它们妄图用这一着来巩固核垄断，把无核国家变成它们的“保护国”，推行新型的核殖民主义。
    但是，它们的这个阴谋从一开始就遭到许多国家的抵制和反对。在这里，要特别提到，坦桑尼亚有力地揭露了这个条约的新殖民主义性质，坚决地反对了这个条约。对坦桑尼亚这种不畏强暴、坚持正义的精神，我们表示钦佩。
    我们伟大领袖毛泽东主席早就指出：“美帝国主义手里的原子弹、氢弹，是吓不倒一切不愿意做奴隶的人们的。”核武器阻挡不了全世界人民反帝革命斗争的伟大洪流。核武器救不了帝国主义的命，也救不了现代修正主义的命。
    中国从发展核武器的头一天起，就是为着打破大国的核垄断，实现世界各国不分大小一律平等的地位，就是为着最终消灭核武器。我们坚决主张全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器，并一再声明决不首先使用核武器。我们相信，我们的目的一定能够达到。
    我们伟大领袖毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，经过两年来轰轰烈烈的斗争，现在已经进入夺取全面胜利的阶段。尼雷尔总统说过，中国文化大革命是“为了继续保持革命的精神和目标”。这是对我国文化大革命的赞扬和支持。我们一定不辜负我们的朋友对于我们的期望。无产阶级国际主义是我国对外政策的最高指导原则。我们将继续在和平共处五项原则的基础上大力发展同友好国家之间的关系。我们将更紧密地同世界各国人民联合起来，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底，把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底！
