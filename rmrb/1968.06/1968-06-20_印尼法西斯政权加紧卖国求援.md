Under the fascist military regime in Indonesia, the economic situation is deteriorating rapidly. Recently, the right-wing politician Sumitro, who was appointed by Suharto to the anti-communist cabinet as the Minister of Trade, admitted that Indonesia's current economic situation is "difficult and serious." He said that Indonesia's export value in January and February this year was only half of that in the same period last year. "The operating rates of the textile industry, small-scale industries, and handicrafts are at most only 10%," while the price of rice has increased fourfold compared to a year ago.

Now, the Indonesian fascist military regime is intensifying its efforts to sell out the country to seek aid, attempting to maintain this economically bankrupt situation. On June 11, the Indonesian parliament openly passed the "Foreign Investment Protection Plan," paving the way for foreign capital.

    印尼法西斯政权加紧卖国求援
    在法西斯军人政权统治下的印尼，经济状况正在日益恶化。最近被苏哈托拉入反共内阁担任贸易部长的右派政客苏米特罗承认，印尼目前的经济情况是“困难而严重的”。他说，今年一、二月份印尼出口值只占去年同期的一半，“纺织工业，小工业和手工业开工率最多只达百分之十”，而米价则比一年前上涨了四倍。
    现在，印尼法西斯军人政权正在加紧卖国求援，力图维持这个千疮百孔的经济烂摊子。六月十一日，印尼国会公开通过“保护外国投资方案”，为外国资本大开方便之门。
