After becoming a cadre, I often thought: I am the son of a hired farmer, and I must not forget the past hardships. Not for a moment should I detach myself from the masses, nor should I have the mindset of an official or a lord. I must always be a servant of the people. Initially, I saw some cadres with airs, and I couldn't stand it. However, later, when I was transferred to work at the county office, as my position was elevated and my living conditions improved, I went among the masses less often, and my class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants gradually faded. I began to tolerate some cadres' airs, and at that time, my thought was: After all, being a cadre, one can't completely be the same as the common people. With the thought of "not being the same," my actions also became different from the masses. Before the Cultural Revolution, I came to Shancizich Commune to serve as the Party Committee Secretary. I wore a raincoat and bought some fine clothes, wanting to live and eat well, thinking I should have the "appearance" of a secretary. At this time, the masses looked at me differently. Once, I went to an old poor peasant's home, and when I was about to sit down, the old lady hurriedly wiped the kang (bed) for me; when eating, the old man and old lady were worried that I wouldn't be able to eat the steamed buns. I invited them to eat at the same table, but they said: "We farmers work in the fields all day, our hands have manure smell, and our bodies have dirt, we are not clean." Seeing this, I thought, in the past, when I fought against the landlords with my poor brothers, when we worked together in cooperatives, when we fought side by side in the revolution, we ate at the same table, slept on the same kang, worked shoulder to shoulder, and participated in struggles hand in hand. The poor and lower-middle peasants never treated themselves as guests. But today, the poor peasant masses are so "polite" to me, treating me as so "noble." Isn't this a sign that I have changed? Isn't this a stern criticism of me? This shows that in the eyes of the masses, I am not one of the common people, but an "official."

After the Cultural Revolution began, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants seriously criticized my shortcomings and mistakes. Some old poor peasants criticized me, saying: "You are the son of a hired farmer, you have suffered in the past, and the Party and the people trust you, so they let you be a cadre, hoping you will hold the printing press of the proletariat well. But you, as a secretary, despise us farmers as 'rustic,' and start showing off, isn't this clearly sliding towards the 'revisionist' path?" The masses' earnest criticism deeply touched my soul, and many past events flashed through my mind.

In the dark old society, my father worked for the landlord, my mother begged for food, and I herded pigs and cows for the rich, and our family suffered endless exploitation and oppression from the landlord bullies. I myself was also beaten by the Nationalist Party officials. Now, I have forgotten my roots and slowly changed. Thinking of these things, I was greatly shocked. Comparing myself with Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our Party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords who sit on the heads of the people." Reflecting on my own changes in thought, listening to the masses' criticisms, I further realized: After becoming a cadre, it is either to continue to be a good common person, to be an ordinary laborer, to serve the people wholeheartedly, or to detach oneself from the masses, to be high and mighty, to put on official airs. This is the dividing line between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview, and an important sign to distinguish between proletarian leaders and bourgeois leaders. A cadre, no matter how good his origins, coming from the common people, if he has the thought that "being a cadre means one can't be the same as the common people," and does not go among the masses to seriously reform himself, he will forget his roots, fade, and change quality, becoming a lord who sits on the heads of the people, and finally fall into the mud of revisionism.

After this, with the help of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, I brought my problems and actively went among the masses to seriously reform my worldview, determined to be a servant of the people for life. Once, I carried Chairman Mao's Red Book, with my luggage and production tools, and went to the most remote and difficult Quezi Shi Brigade in the entire commune, specifically to the home of old poor peasant and Five Guarantees beneficiary Jia Mingliang, to "settle down," living with them, fighting against selfishness and revisionism, promoting the revolution, and advancing production. At first, Jia Grandpa said his home was dirty and advised me to move to a family with better conditions. I told the two old people about Chairman Mao's teachings: "The cleanest are the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are still cleaner than the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois intellectuals." I also examined my past erroneous thoughts to the two old people and sincerely asked the two old people to help me. In this way, the two old people treated me as one of their own. After a period of tempering and reform, my face was tanned again, my hands had thick calluses, my body was covered with dust and mud, and more importantly, my proletarian feelings were strengthened, and I thought and did what was on the hearts of the masses. At this time, the masses said I looked like a common person, and they all affectionately called me "Old Hao" or "Fenglin." They were willing to tell me their inner thoughts, and they were also willing to point out my shortcomings to me face to face. When the commune established the Revolutionary Committee, everyone elected me as the director.

In practice, I deeply felt: cadres must go among the masses to seriously reform their worldview, to have the feelings of the masses, to be good servants of the people; to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to ensure that thoughts do not change, power is not lost, and the proletarian dictatorship state will never change color.

    打掉“官气”做人民忠实的勤务员
    辽宁省本溪县山城子公社革命委员会主任　郝凤林
    我当了干部以后，心里常想：我是雇农的儿子，可不能忘记过去的苦，一时一刻也不能脱离群众，不能有当官做老爷的思想，要永远做人民的勤务员。开始，我看到有的干部有架子，很看不惯。可是，后来我被调到县机关工作，随着职务的提升，生活条件的改善，我深入群众少了，和贫下中农的阶级感情逐渐地淡薄起来了。对个别干部摆架子，看着也顺眼了，这时，我的想法是：当干部嘛，总不能完全做到和老百姓一样。有了“不一样”的思想，我自己在行动上也就真的和群众不一样了。无产阶级文化大革命前，我来到山城子公社担任党委书记。我披上了风衣，还买了料子服，吃住都想讲究点，认为应该有个书记的“样子”。这时，群众对我也就另眼看待了。有一次，我到一户老贫农家里，要坐下，大娘急忙给我擦炕沿；吃饭时，大爷、大娘都担心我吃不下窝窝头。我请他们和我在一个桌上吃，他们说：“俺庄稼人成天在地里干活，手上有粪味，身上有泥土，不干净。”见到这种情景，我就想，过去我和穷哥们斗地主，搞合作化，一起干革命的时候，吃饭在一桌，睡觉在一炕，劳动肩并肩，参加斗争手挽手，贫下中农从来不把自己当客人看待。可是今天，贫农群众却对我这样“客气”，把我看得这么“高贵”，这不正说明我已经变了吗？不正是对我的严厉批评吗？这说明我在群众眼中不是老百姓，而是“官”了。
    无产阶级文化大革命运动开始以后，广大贫下中农对我的缺点和错误进行了认真的批评。有些老贫农批评我说：“你是个雇农的儿子，过去受过苦，党和人民信任你，才让你当了干部，希望你掌握好无产阶级的印把子。可是，你当了书记就嫌俺农民‘土气’，摆起阔气来了，这不明明是往‘修’字道上滑吗！”群众的这些语重心长的批评，深深地触动了我的灵魂，许多往事，一幕幕地在头脑里闪过去。
    在黑暗的旧社会，我父亲给地主扛活，母亲讨饭，我给财主放猪放牛，一家人受尽了地主恶霸的剥削压迫，自己还挨过国民党官老爷的毒打。现在自己忘本了，慢慢在“变”了。想到这些，我大吃一惊。对照毛主席的教导：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”回想自己的思想变化，听一听群众的批评，使我进一步认识到：当了干部，是继续当好老百姓，做一个普通劳动者，完全彻底为人民服务，还是脱离群众，高高在上，摆官架子，这是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的分水岭，是区别无产阶级当权派和资产阶级当权派的重要标志。一个干部，尽管出身好，来自老百姓，但是，如果有了“当干部就不可能和老百姓一样”的思想，不到群众当中去认真改造自己，就会忘本、褪色、变质，成为骑在人民头上的官老爷，最后跌进修正主义的泥坑。
    从这以后，在广大贫下中农的帮助下，我带着自己的问题，积极深入到群众当中去，认真地改造自己的世界观，决心为人民当一辈子勤务员。有一次我带着毛主席的红色宝书，背着行李和生产工具，来到全公社最偏僻、最艰苦的柜子石大队，专门找到老贫农、五保户矫明亮老大爷家“落户”，和他们一同生活，一同斗私批修，抓革命，促生产。开始，矫大爷说他家脏，劝我搬到条件好的社员家里去住。我就给两位老人讲毛主席关于“最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净”的教导，并且向两位老人检查了自己过去的错误思想，诚恳地要求两位老人对我进行帮助。这样，两位老人就把我看成是他们自家人了。经过一个时期的锻炼和改造，我的脸又晒黑了，双手磨出了厚厚的茧子，身上沾满了灰土泥巴，更重要的是增强了无产阶级感情，想的做的大都是群众心上的事。这时，群众说我象个老百姓的样子了，都亲热地叫我“老郝”或“凤林”。他们有什么心里话也愿意对我讲，我有什么缺点他们也愿意当面给我提出。公社成立革命委员会时，大家选我当主任。
    我在实践中深深体会到：干部，只有到群众中去认真改造世界观，才能有群众的感情，才能当好人民的勤务员；才能贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，保证思想不修，政权不丢，无产阶级专政的国家永远不变色。
