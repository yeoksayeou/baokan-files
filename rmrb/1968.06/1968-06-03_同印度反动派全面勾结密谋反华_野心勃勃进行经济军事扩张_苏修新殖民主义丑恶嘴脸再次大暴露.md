	In Cahoots with Indian Reactionaries, Conspiring Against China: The Soviet Revisionists' New Colonialist Face Exposed Again

	BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) — Our correspondent reports: Since the beginning of this year, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique has engaged in numerous clandestine activities, tightening its collaboration with the Indian reactionaries who are wholeheartedly serving as the lackeys of U.S. and Soviet aggression and as anti-China tools. These activities have further exposed the Soviet revisionists' ugly new colonialist face.

	Intensifying Counter-Revolutionary Collusion

	At the end of January, Soviet revisionist leader Alexei Kosygin led a large delegation to India, marking a significant step in the Soviet revisionists' further tightening of counter-revolutionary collusion with the Indian reactionaries. During his stay in New Delhi, Kosygin reached a series of major agreements with Indian reactionary Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on comprehensive collusion and joint anti-China efforts. After returning to his country, various Soviet delegations followed in quick succession to India, with fifteen delegations arriving between late February and early March alone. These delegations included experts in naval, petroleum, railway, civil aviation, education, science, economic, and industrial development. These delegations conspired with the Indian reactionaries on specific issues related to their comprehensive collusion.

	One of the main objectives of Kosygin's trip to India was to conspire with the Indian reactionaries to exchange "intelligence" related to China for the shameful purpose of jointly opposing China. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique's despicable and shameless counter-revolutionary actions have once again exposed its treacherous, traitorous, and reactionary face as an accomplice of U.S. imperialism to the people of the world.

	Engaging in Infiltration and Expansion

	Recently, the Soviet revisionists have particularly strengthened their collusion with the Indian reactionaries in the naval sector. It has been revealed that the Soviet Union and India have reached an agreement whereby the Soviet revisionists, in addition to agreeing to provide the Indian reactionaries with submarines and other naval vessels, have decided to help India transform the Vishakhapatnam port in the Bay of Bengal and the Blair port in the Andaman Islands into naval bases. In return, India has allowed Soviet vessels to dock and undergo maintenance in Indian ports, effectively providing the Soviet revisionists with naval bases.

	The Soviet-Indian counter-revolutionary collusion in the military sector is aimed at the great People's Republic of China. The Soviet revisionist clique, which has been aggressively pushing its new colonialist expansion policy abroad, has long harbored ambitions in Southeast Asia, striving to gain political control and economic infiltration in the region, and colluding with the region's reactionaries and U.S. imperialism to form an anti-China encirclement. Due to the lack of a decent naval base in the Asian region, the Soviet revisionists have sought to establish a naval base in India by helping the Indian reactionaries expand their navy, further infiltrating the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia. The Indian reactionaries, who have always been ambitious, have arrogantly claimed to take over the British Empire's control of the Indian Ocean, but due to their weak naval forces, they are unable to do so. Therefore, they have colluded with the Soviet revisionists in a dirty deal to provide the Soviet revisionists with naval bases in exchange for Soviet vessels.

	It is worth noting that the agreements signed by the Soviet revisionists with India in the fields of culture and science and technology this year also serve their new colonialist policy. For example, the so-called "scientific cooperation" agreement signed by the Soviet Union and India in early February includes the immediate cooperation of both parties to survey the Indian Ocean, which is obviously a preparation for their intensified naval collusion.

	Plundering Under the Guise of "Aid"

	Since the beginning of this year, the Soviet-Indian economic collusion has also been accelerating. According to the Indian bourgeois newspaper "The Hindustan Times," after Soviet leader Kosygin's visit to India in January, the Soviet revisionists have sent five economic delegations to India, signing numerous agreements and contracts with the Indian reactionaries. Indian reactionary government's Commerce Minister Dinesh Singh will visit the Soviet Union in mid-June to discuss with the Soviet revisionist clique the further tightening of economic collusion between the two countries. The newspaper also stated that Dinesh Singh will discuss with the Soviet revisionist clique the coordination of economic plans between the Soviet Union and India, the establishment of joint enterprises, and the increase of Soviet exports to India.

	The Soviet revisionists, under the guise of economic "aid" to India, have been intensifying their economic infiltration and plunder, which is an important means of their new colonialist policy. After the Soviet revisionist clique restored capitalism at home, it urgently sought foreign markets. Therefore, the Soviet revisionists have particularly focused on plundering India, which has a population of five hundred million. The Soviet revisionists have always used high-priced, low-quality machinery and equipment to exchange for India's agricultural products and light industrial products, which is a replica of the unequal exchange of imperialist plunder of colonies and semi-colonies. Recently, in order to strengthen their plunder of India, the Soviet revisionists have openly attempted to coordinate the economic plans of the two countries and establish some enterprises directly serving the Soviet revisionists in India, gradually strengthening their control over India's economy. The Soviet revisionists' actions have exposed their new colonialist face of plundering under the guise of "aid."

	Collaborating with U.S. Imperialism to Jointly Oppose China

	The so-called "Soviet-Indian cooperation" advocated by the Soviet revisionists is actually a component of the Soviet revisionist clique's reactionary policy of "U.S.-Soviet joint opposition to China." The U.S. and the Soviet Union have always supported the Indian reactionaries in a coordinated manner. In recent years, the U.S. imperialists have been defeated by the Vietnamese people in the Vietnam War and have been facing worsening financial situations at home. Therefore, they hope that the Soviet revisionists will provide substantial "aid" to India to jointly stabilize the rule of the Indian reactionaries.

	The Soviet revisionist renegade clique, in collaboration with U.S. imperialism, has been intensifying its support for the Indian reactionaries, gradually turning India into a joint military base and semi-colony of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, bringing deep suffering to the Indian people. The Indian people have gradually seen through the Soviet revisionists' true colors of fake aid and real plunder, fake friends and real enemies, and have gradually seen through the Soviet revisionists as new colonialists under the banner of "socialism." They have also gradually seen through the fact that U.S. "aid" and Soviet "aid" are of the same kind. The broad masses of the Indian people are becoming increasingly aware and are rising up to fight to overthrow the rule of the Indian reactionaries, who are the agents of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists.

	Great Teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again... until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." No matter how the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionists, and their lackeys, the Indian reactionaries, intensify their collusion and rampage for a time, they will never escape the historical punishment and the ultimate fate of perishing.

    同印度反动派全面勾结密谋反华　野心勃勃进行经济军事扩张
    苏修新殖民主义丑恶嘴脸再次大暴露
    新华社一日讯　本社记者报道：今年以来，苏修叛徒集团进行了许多阴谋活动，同死心塌地充当美苏的侵略走卒和反华工具的印度反动派加紧全面勾结。在这些活动中，苏修叛徒集团进一步暴露了它的新殖民主义的丑恶嘴脸。
    加紧反革命勾结
    苏修头目柯西金在一月底带领庞大的代表团到印度活动，这是苏修同印度反动派进一步加紧反革命勾结的重大步骤。柯西金在新德里期间，同印度反动政府总理英迪拉·甘地就两国的全面勾结和联合反华等一系列重大问题达成了原则协议。柯西金回国后，苏修各种代表团接踵到印度活动，从二月下旬到三月初的半个月内，多达十五起，其中包括海军、石油、铁道、民航、文教、科学、经济与工业发展“专家”等。这些代表团同印度反动派密谋了双方全面勾结的具体问题。
    柯西金这次到印度阴谋活动的内容之一，就是苏修和印度反动派为了联合反华的可耻目的，决定交换有关中国的“情报”，并由美、苏、印三家“汇总使用”。苏修叛徒集团的卑鄙无耻的反革命行径，又一次在世界人民面前暴露了它的大叛徒、大工贼和美帝帮凶的反革命狰狞面目。
    大搞渗透和扩张
    最近以来，苏修同印度反动派特别加强在海军方面的勾结。据透露，苏印已达成协议，苏修除已同意向印度反动派提供潜水艇及其他海军舰艇外，还决定帮助印度把孟加拉湾的维萨卡帕特南港和安达曼群岛的布莱尔港改建成海军基地。印度则允许苏修舰艇在印度海港停泊和维修，实际上是由印度反动政府向苏修提供海军基地。
    苏印在军事方面加紧反革命勾结的矛头，指向伟大的中华人民共和国。对外竭力推行新殖民主义扩张政策的苏修集团，一向对东南亚地区野心勃勃，竭力在这个地区搞政治控制和经济渗透，并与这个地区的反动派和美帝勾结，组成新月形的反华包围圈。由于苏修在亚洲地区缺少象样的海军基地，因此，它通过为印度反动派扩建海军，在印度取得海军基地，进一步插足印度洋和东南亚地区。而一向野心勃勃的印度反动派，狂妄地叫嚷要接替英帝控制印度洋，但由于海军力量极为薄弱，力不从心，因此，同苏修狼狈为奸，做了一桩向苏修提供海军基地来换取苏修舰艇的肮脏交易。
    值得注意的是，苏修今年在文化和科学技术方面同印度签订的一些协定，也是为它的新殖民主义政策服务的。例如，二月初苏印签订的所谓“科学合作”协议，就包括双方“立即合作”考察印度洋的内容，这显然是为双方在海军方面加紧勾结准备条件。
    借“援助”之名大肆掠夺
    今年以来，苏印在经济方面的勾结也在加速进行。据印度资产阶级报纸《印度斯坦时报》透露，自苏修头目柯西金一月份到印度活动后，苏修已先后派出五个经济代表团到印度，同印度反动派签订了许多项协定和合同。印度反动政府的商业部长迪内希·辛格将于六月中旬去苏联，同苏修集团详细讨论两国之间进一步加紧经济勾结的问题。这家报纸还说，迪内希·辛格将和苏修集团讨论协调苏印两国经济计划、建立两国联合企业以及增加苏修对印度出口的项目等问题。
    苏修以经济“援助”印度为名加紧进行经济渗透和掠夺，是它推行新殖民主义政策的重要手段。苏修集团在国内实现资本主义复辟后，急于在寻找国外市场。因此，苏修特别注意掠夺拥有五亿人口的印度。苏修一向利用价高质劣的机器装备交换印度的农产品和轻工业品，这是历来帝国主义掠夺殖民地、半殖民地的不等价交换的翻版。近来为了加强对印度的掠夺，苏修公然企图通过协调两国经济计划和在印度建立一些直接为苏修服务的企业等办法，逐步加强对印度经济的控制。苏修这种做法，赤裸裸地暴露了它借“援助”之名，行掠夺之实的新殖民主义面目。
    配合美帝共同反华
    苏修鼓吹的所谓“苏印合作”，实际上是苏修集团推行的“美苏联合反华”的反动政策的一个组成部分。美、苏对印度反动派的扶植，向来是互相配合的。近年来，美帝在侵越战争中被越南人民打得一败涂地，在美国国内，财政状况日益恶化，因此，它希望通过苏修大力向印度提供“援助”来共同稳定印度反动派的统治。
    苏修叛徒集团配合美帝加紧扶植印度反动派，使印度逐步沦为美苏共同的军事基地和半殖民地，给印度人民带来了深重的灾难。印度人民逐渐看穿苏修假援助真掠夺、假朋友真敌人的本质，逐渐看穿苏修是打着“社会主义”招牌的新殖民主义者，逐渐看穿美“援”和苏“援”是一路货。印度广大人民群众正在日益觉醒，正在起来为推翻美帝、苏修在印度的代理人印度反动派的统治而斗争。
    伟大导师毛主席教导我们说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”不管美帝、苏修和它们的走狗印度反动派如何加紧勾结，猖獗一时，但是它们绝对逃脱不了历史的惩罚和最终灭亡的命运。
