In the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the preliminary evaluation of the Four Good Units has been launched throughout the army. By conducting this preliminary evaluation, the Four Good Units movement in our army will be elevated to a new level, which is of great significance in further strengthening the revolutionary construction of the troops and in achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao, based on Chairman Mao's military line, proposed a series of fundamental principles for building the army, including actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the Four Firsts, promoting the Three-Eight Style, practicing the Three Great Democracies, and carrying out the Four Good Units movement. This series of principles is the foundation of our army's construction. Carrying out the Four Good Units movement is an important part of these principles, a crucial guarantee for their implementation at the grassroots level, and a strategic measure to implement Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, strengthen grassroots construction, and turn our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Practice is the criterion of truth. Since the Four Good Units movement began in 1961, Chairman Mao's proletarian military line has deeply taken root in the units, greatly promoting the revolutionary spirit of the units. The broad cadres and soldiers of our army, in the turbulent waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and steadfastly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have withstood severe tests and made outstanding contributions to the people. People have increasingly come to realize that whether or not to steadfastly carry forward the Four Good Units movement is a fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao's military line. It is a major issue concerning whether our army's revolutionary traditions can be passed down from generation to generation and whether our army can successfully fulfill the political tasks of defending the country and supporting the "Three Supports, Two Militarys."

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Marxism must always advance; it must advance with the development of practice. If it stands still and remains the same, it will lose its vitality. However, the basic principles of Marxism must not be violated; otherwise, errors will be committed."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is developing deeply and steadily. Class struggle is extremely sharp and complex. Our army is shouldering arduous and heavy tasks. The members of the units are constantly being renewed. The new situation requires us to firmly grasp the fundamental aspect of the Four Good Units movement and elevate it to a new level.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao pointed out: "Military work involves countless details. As long as we vigorously study and apply Chairman Mao's works and focus on the education of the two lines, all problems can be solved." To adapt to the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and elevate the Four Good Units movement to a new level, we must vigorously strengthen the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, focus on the education of the two-line struggle, and cultivate units and soldiers who are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the new historical period of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the struggle between the two classes and the two roads is prominently manifested as the struggle between the two lines within the Party. Without awareness of the struggle between the two lines, one cannot distinguish right from wrong, friend from foe, or left from right and center. One would not understand the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Firmly implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the most important political task at present, the great principle of the revolution, and the primary sign of ideological revolutionization.

In the new situation, the most fundamental aspect of creating Four Good Units is to firmly grasp the central link of raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines. We must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought with the problems of the struggle between the two lines in mind, especially study Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, and a series of latest instructions on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must actively participate in the practice of the struggle between the two lines, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. We must thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of the capitalist reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev and the capitalist military line of the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. In the practice of struggle, we must constantly summarize experiences with Mao Zedong Thought, consciously transform our subjective world while transforming the objective world. Through continuous study, struggle, and summary, we must ensure that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line deeply takes root in the units and that the thoughts of the troops fully meet the needs of implementing and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines is a common task for the entire army. Units carrying out the "Three Supports, Two Militarys" tasks live in the best classroom for the education of the struggle between the two lines. This does not mean that they do not need to firmly grasp the awareness of the struggle between the two lines and firmly grasp their own ideological revolutionization. The political significance of the task itself is one thing, but whether the personnel executing the task understand its political significance and have consciousness is another. The stronger the political nature of the task, the higher the requirements for the revolutionization of the troops, and the more necessary it is to consciously transform oneself. Units carrying out other tasks, in the struggle between the two lines, also have the issue of choosing sides for everyone's thoughts and actions, either standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line or on the side of the capitalist reactionary line. Only by continuously raising the awareness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can we meet the needs of the developing situation and tasks.

The awareness of the struggle between the two lines must be implemented in the four aspects of the Four Good Units. Vice Chairman Lin Biao pointed out: "After all these years, the most important things are still these few: doing well in political and ideological work, improving style, training, and managing life.... We cannot build our troops without building the grassroots units well, and we cannot build the grassroots units well without doing well in these four aspects." We must use the excellence in political and ideological work to lead and promote the other three aspects. In the four aspects of the Four Good Units, we must, according to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, endow them with new content and propose new requirements. We must ensure that Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are thoroughly implemented and fully carried out in the four aspects.

The situation of creating Four Good Units in our army is excellent. All levels of leadership must take the lead in the movement. With sufficient energy, they must focus on the revolutionary construction of the troops. They must seriously implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," arrange unit work according to the Four Good Units, prioritize political and ideological work, and also do well in the Three-Eight Style, military training, and life management. They must frequently go deep into the lower levels, conduct investigations and research, analyze and summarize the new trends, achievements, experiences, and problems that have emerged in the Four Good Units movement, and continuously push the movement forward.

At present, all levels of leadership must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "summarizing achievements, correcting errors, and preparing for future battles" and seriously focus on the preliminary evaluation of the Four Good Units. They must mobilize the broad cadres and soldiers, use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, use Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics as a weapon, and use Comrade Tan Huaizhong, an exemplary cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, as a model. They must adopt the method of mass self-education, focusing on examining and summarizing the experiences of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle between the two lines, raising class struggle awareness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines, eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, and transforming worldviews. Through examination and summary, they must vigorously commend exemplary individuals and collectives who are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, find weak links, and clarify the direction of efforts. They must make the preliminary evaluation of the Four Good Units a Mao Zedong Thought study class for raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines and a battlefield for revolutionary criticism, promote the full implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and ensure that the troops better advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to victory.

### 把创造四好连队运动提高到新水平

    把创造四好连队运动提高到新水平
    在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，四好初评在全军普遍展开。通过这次初评，把我军的四好连队运动提高到一个新水平，对于进一步加强部队的革命化建设，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，有着十分重要的意义。
    林彪副主席根据毛主席的建军路线提出的活学活用毛主席著作、突出无产阶级政治、坚持四个第一、大兴三八作风、发扬三大民主、开展四好连队运动等一系列着重政治建军的方针原则，是我军建设的根本。开展四好连队运动，是这一整套方针原则的重要组成部分，是这些方针原则在基层落实的重要保证，是贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级建军路线，加强基层建设，把我军办成毛泽东思想大学校的战略措施。
    实践是真理的标准。从一九六一年开始的四好连队运动，使毛主席的无产阶级建军路线深深扎根于连队，大大促进了连队的革命化。我军广大干部战士，在无产阶级文化大革命的惊涛骇浪中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚定不移地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，经受住严峻的考验，为人民立下卓越功勋。人们越来越清楚地认识到，是不是坚定不移地进一步开展四好连队运动，是对毛主席的建军路线的根本态度问题，是关系到我军的革命传统能不能代代相传，关系到我军能不能胜利完成保卫国防和“三支”“两军”等各项政治任务的大问题。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“马克思主义一定要向前发展，要随着实践的发展而发展，不能停滞不前。停止了，老是那么一套，它就没有生命了。但是，马克思主义的基本原则又是不能违背的，违背了就要犯错误。”
    我国无产阶级文化大革命正在深入向前发展，阶级斗争极其尖锐复杂，我军担负着艰巨而繁重的斗争任务，连队成员也在不断更新。新的形势，要求我们紧紧抓住创造四好连队运动这个根本性的东西不放，并且把它提高到一个新的水平。
    林彪副主席指出：“部队工作千头万绪，只要大力活学活用毛主席著作，抓好两条路线教育，一切问题就可以迎刃而解。”适应无产阶级文化大革命的新形势，把创造四好连队运动推向新水平，就是要大力加强活学活用毛主席著作，抓好两条路线斗争教育，培养忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的四好连队和五好战士。
    在无产阶级专政下继续革命的新的历史时期，两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，突出地表现为党内两条路线的斗争。没有路线斗争的觉悟，就分不清是非，分不清敌我，分不清左中右，就不懂得无产阶级专政下的革命。坚决执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线，是当前最大的政治，是革命的大节，是思想革命化的首要标志。
    在新形势下创造四好连队，最根本的，是必须紧紧掌握提高路线斗争觉悟这个中心环节。要带着两条路线斗争中的问题，活学活用毛泽东思想，特别要学好毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策和一系列最新指示。要积极投入两条路线斗争的实践中去，以毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的流毒，彻底肃清反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的资产阶级军事路线的流毒。要在斗争实践中，不断用毛泽东思想总结经验，在改造客观世界的同时，自觉地改造主观世界。通过不断的学习、斗争、总结，使毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在连队深深扎根，使部队的思想完全符合执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的需要。
    提高两条路线斗争的觉悟，是全军共同的任务。执行“三支”“两军”任务的连队，生活在两条路线斗争教育最好的大课堂里，这不等于说，他们就不需要狠抓两条路线斗争的觉悟，狠抓自身的思想革命化了。任务本身的政治意义是一回事，执行任务的人懂不懂它的政治意义，有没有自觉性，是另一回事。任务的政治性越强，对部队革命化的要求就越高，就越要自觉地改造自己。执行其他各项任务的连队，在两条路线斗争中，每个人的思想和行动，也都有一个站队的问题，不是站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，就是站在资产阶级反动路线一边。只有不断提高对毛主席革命路线的觉悟，才能适应形势任务发展的需要。
    两条路线斗争的觉悟，要贯彻到四好的四个方面去。林彪副主席指出：“我们几十年搞过来搞过去，最重要的事情还是这几样：搞好政治思想工作，搞好作风，搞好训练，搞好生活管理。……我们部队建设不把基层单位搞好不行，要搞好基层单位不搞好这四样也不行。”我们要以政治思想好统帅和带动其他三好。在四好的四个方面，都要按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，赋予新的内容，提出新的要求。要使毛主席的一系列最新指示，在四好的四个方面彻底贯彻，全面落实。
    我军创造四好连队运动的形势一片大好。各级领导一定要站在运动的前面。要以足够的精力，抓好部队的革命化建设。要认真贯彻毛主席“抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备”的方针，按照四好去安排连队工作，做到有主有次，把政治思想工作始终放在第一位，三八作风、军事训练、生活管理也要搞好。要经常深入下层，调查研究，分析和总结四好运动中出现的新动向、新成就、新经验、新问题，把运动不断推向前进。
    当前，各级领导一定要遵照毛主席关于“发扬成绩，纠正错误，以利再战”的教导，认真抓好四好初评工作。要发动广大干部战士，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，以林彪副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的指示为武器，以“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志为榜样，采取群众性的自我教育的方法，着重地检查总结在两条路线斗争中，活学活用毛泽东思想，提高阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟，破私立公，改造世界观的经验。通过检查总结，大力表扬忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的先进人物和先进集体，找出薄弱环节，明确努力方向。要使四好初评成为提高两条路线斗争觉悟的毛泽东思想学习班，成为革命大批判的战场，促进毛主席一系列最新指示的全面落实，保证部队更好地沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。　（六月十六日）
