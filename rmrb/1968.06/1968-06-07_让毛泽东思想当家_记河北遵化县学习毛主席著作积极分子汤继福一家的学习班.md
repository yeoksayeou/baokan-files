The family Mao Zedong Thought study class led by Mao Zedong Thought study activist Tang Jifu from Zunhua County, Hebei, uses Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize and repudiate revisionism and promote the ideological transformation of the entire family, changing the entire family's outlook.

Eliminating the Poison of the Chinese Khrushchev

Tang Jifu joined the great Communist Party of China in 1944. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the land reform, he served as a village cadre. However, after the nation's victory, he thought the revolution was already complete, and his thinking changed. He often thought, "Looking at the small family, thinking of the eight mouths to feed," "Growing vegetables and melons to sell for money." Through studying Chairman Mao's works and criticizing the various fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, Tang Jifu was greatly shocked. He said in the family study class, "My thinking was poisoned by the 'four freedoms' and 'three selfs, one package' of the Chinese Khrushchev! I never thought the Chinese Khrushchev had left footprints in our family!" His wife, Wang Shulan, also checked herself, saying, "Those years, I only thought about the old sow giving birth to piglets and the old hen laying eggs, completely neglecting national affairs and collective enterprises. I really let Chairman Mao down!" They exposed themselves in the study class, and the whole family helped each other criticize and repudiate, raising everyone's ideological awareness. The third daughter, Su Ping, said, "In the past, when picking cotton, if I heard it was piecework, I would pick more and faster, picking only the big and wet ones, resulting in harming the collective and benefiting myself. This was also poisoned by the 'work points in command' and 'material incentives' of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary economism!"

Not Just Quantity, But Quality

Last winter, some households were very diligent in adding soil to their pigpens. Tang Jifu's children also actively dug soil to add to the pens. Tang Jifu felt there was a problem and raised this issue in the family study class. Su Ping said, "Digging more pits and adding more soil, accumulating more fertilizer and producing more grain, thinking for the collective, doing for the collective, what's wrong with that?" This sparked a family debate.

One said, "Why not add soil to the collective's fertilizer pits and pigpens more diligently?" Another said, "Isn't it just to add more soil, produce more fertilizer, and earn more work points!" This clarified the issue. Tang Jifu said, "You all add soil to the pigpens every few days, only caring about quantity, not quality. On the surface, it seems like you are actively accumulating fertilizer, but in reality, you are actively seeking work points." His wife, Wang Shulan, also said, "That soil is added for 'self.' " The second daughter, Su Yun, said, "We are laying the foundation for revisionism." This made Su Ping realize, "Yes! We must not lay the foundation for revisionism!"

See Public and Learn, See Private and Dig Out

Through running the family study class, the proletarian consciousness of the Tang Jifu family has been continuously raised. Last year, when the village was hit by a major flood, four households of community members were trapped, unable to escape, and their houses were in danger of collapsing. Su Yun and Su Ping decided to rescue the community members. Their mother, seeing the water was deep, was reluctant to let them go. However, they remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other," and resolutely joined the intense rescue work. With the help of other militiamen, they finally rescued the four households and arranged for them to stay at Tang Jifu's home. Tang Jifu's wife was deeply moved and enthusiastically cared for the affected community members.

Now, in Tang Jifu's family, it is truly done: see public and learn, see private and dig out, actions in line with Mao Zedong Thought are praised, actions not in line with Mao Zedong Thought are criticized, Mao Zedong Thought truly takes the lead.

    让毛泽东思想当家
    ——记河北遵化县学习毛主席著作积极分子汤继福一家的学习班
    河北遵化县学习毛主席著作积极分子汤继福办的家庭毛泽东思想学习班，以毛泽东思想为武器，斗私批修，促进了全家人的思想革命化，改变了整个家庭的面貌。
    清除中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒
    汤继福在一九四四年就加入了伟大的中国共产党，在抗日战争和土地改革中都担任过村干部。但是从全国胜利后，他以为革命已经大功告成，思想也就起了变化，常常是“眼看小家庭，心想八口人”，“种菜种瓜，好卖钱花”。通过学习毛主席著作和批判中国赫鲁晓夫的种种谬论，汤继福大吃一惊。他在家庭学习班上说：“我的思想，正是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的‘四大自由’、‘三自一包’的流毒啊！没想到中国赫鲁晓夫在我们家还留下了‘脚印’哩！”老伴王淑兰也检查说：“那几年光想老母猪生小猪，老母鸡下蛋，国家大事，集体事业全放在一边了，实在太对不起毛主席他老人家啊！”他们在学习班这样一亮，全家帮助一斗，大家的思想认识提高了。三闺女素萍说：“过去摘棉花，一听说是包工，我就摘得多，摘得快，尽摘大的、湿的，结果坑了集体，肥了自己。这也是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的‘工分挂帅’、‘物质刺激’的反革命经济主义的流毒啊！”
    不能只顾数量，不顾质量
    去年冬天，有些户往猪圈垫土垫得很勤，汤继福家的几个孩子也积极挖土垫圈。汤继福感到有问题，就把这个问题在家庭学习班上提出来了。素萍说：“多挖坑土多垫圈，多积肥料多打粮，想的是为集体，做的还是为集体，这有啥错？”这一下全家争论开了。
    这个说：“为啥不往队里的积肥坑和猪圈勤垫土？”那个说：“还不是想多垫点土，多出点肥，多要工分呗！”这样，问题就清楚了。汤继福说：“你们这样三天两头往猪圈垫土，只顾数量，不顾质量，表面上看来象是在积极积肥，实际上是积极争工分。”老伴王淑兰也说：“那垫的是‘私’字。”二闺女素云说：“我们是在垫修正主义路基。”这才使素萍猛醒过来，她说：“是呀！我们绝不能为修正主义垫路基！”
    见公就学，见私就挖
    通过办家庭学习班，汤继福一家的无产阶级觉悟不断提高。去年村里发了一次大水，当时有四户社员的家被淹了，人出不来，房屋随时有倒塌的危险。素云、素萍决定去抢救社员，她妈看着水大，怕她们出事，不大愿意让她们去。可是她们想起了毛主席的“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导，就毅然地投入到紧张的抢救工作中去。在其他民兵的协助下，终于把四户社员救了出来，安置在汤继福家里。汤继福的老伴很受感动，热情地照顾那些受难的社员。
    现在，在汤继福的家庭里真正做到了：见公就学，见私就挖，符合毛泽东思想的言行有人夸，不符合毛泽东思想的言行有人抓，毛泽东思想真正当了家。
