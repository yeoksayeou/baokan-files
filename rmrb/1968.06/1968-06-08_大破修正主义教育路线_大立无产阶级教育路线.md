Holding high the brilliant banner of Chairman Mao's educational revolution, and starting from the interests of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, the revolutionary teachers and students of the elementary schools in Shancizicheng Commune, Benxi County, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, under the assistance of the military training team of the leftist support troops, have carried out a series of reforms in teaching ideology, system, content, methods, and school management.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Shenyang, the revolutionary teachers and students of the elementary schools in Shancizicheng Commune, Benxi County, Liaoning Province, with the assistance of the military training team of the leftist support troops, have set up extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, conducted in-depth revolutionary criticism, smashed the revisionist educational line, and established the proletarian educational line. They have carried out an educational revolution based on the characteristics of rural areas and the interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants, which has been warmly praised and supported by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

Shancizicheng Commune is located in a mountainous area. The entire commune has seven complete elementary schools and eleven brigade-run elementary schools, with a total of 2,600 teachers and students. When classes resumed in March last year, some teachers lacked confidence in carrying out the educational revolution in the rural schools. The comrades from the military training team believed that the reason for this was that the revisionist educational line had not been thoroughly criticized and smashed, its poisonous influence had not been eliminated, and therefore there was not enough hatred for the revisionist educational line, and the determination and confidence to carry out the educational revolution and establish the proletarian educational line were not strong enough. Therefore, the comrades from the military training team helped the revolutionary teachers and students set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes and brought the study classes to the poor and lower-middle peasants. Together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, they studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, participated in labor, engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and carried out the "Three Remembrances, Three Discussions, and Three Reflections" activities: First, reflect on the bitterness of oppression in the old society, discuss the sweetness of the new society, and think about Chairman Mao's kindness; second, reflect on the harm of the old educational system to the poor and lower-middle peasants, discuss the great significance of the proletarian educational revolution, and think about the correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on the educational revolution; third, reflect on the history of class struggle on the educational front over the past seventeen years, discuss the new situation of the struggle between the two lines in the current schools, and think about one's own responsibility for the educational revolution. In the study classes, the revolutionary teachers and students listened to the bitter stories of the old poor peasants about the class oppression in the old society, deeply criticized the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in restoring capitalism in the countryside, and received profound class education. They strengthened their class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants and enhanced their class struggle awareness and consciousness of the struggle between the two lines. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Therefore, to establish the proletarian educational line, we must first start with 'destruction,' thoroughly expose and criticize the revisionist educational line, and eliminate its poisonous influence. After raising their awareness, the revolutionary teachers and students, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, took up the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, verbally and in writing, launched a "people's war" to besiege Chinese Khrushchev and his revisionist educational line, and quickly initiated a high tide of revolutionary criticism throughout the commune's schools.

Chairman Mao has given us the policy of serving proletarian politics with education and combining education with productive labor. Chinese Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi blatantly distorted this proletarian educational policy formulated by Chairman Mao, fiercely hated and opposed the study of Mao Zedong Thought, and promoted the revisionist educational line. Many revolutionary teachers and students, through their personal experiences of being poisoned, angrily exposed and denounced the crimes of Chinese Khrushchev in promoting the revisionist educational line, poisoning the youth, and attempting to cultivate revisionist seeds from the offspring of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The revolutionary teachers and students clearly saw that the revisionist educational line made students detached from the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, serving to cultivate successors for the bourgeoisie and restore capitalism. Many teachers and students listed numerous facts to expose and denounce the crimes of Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the educational field in promoting the revisionist educational line, suppressing and attacking the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside. The oppressed children of the poor and lower-middle peasants shouted in the revolutionary criticism: "We will definitely rebel against the revisionist educational line! Down with Chinese Khrushchev!" As the revolutionary criticism deepened, the revolutionary teachers and students' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines greatly increased. They hated the revisionist educational line promoted by Chinese Khrushchev more and more, their determination to carry out the educational revolution became stronger and stronger, their confidence grew, and their thoughts of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants became more and more firm. The revolutionary teachers and students, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, held high the brilliant banner of Chairman Mao's educational revolution, took Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as the guiding principle, and in the practice of the educational revolution, displayed the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and dare to do, carrying out a series of reforms in teaching ideology, system, content, methods, and school management.

1. The teaching work is guided by the "Three Loyalties," taking loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the fundamental principle of all work, permeating all activities. Revolutionary teachers and students, through the "Three Loyalties" activities in teaching work, deeply felt that being loyal to Chairman Mao is the greatest "publicness," thus further initiating a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, pushing the teaching work to a new stage.

2. Completely change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating the schools, allowing the poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in leadership, and changing the old leadership system. The commune's educational revolution committee and the revolutionary three-in-one leadership groups of various elementary schools all include representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants; select outstanding children of the poor and lower-middle peasants to be teachers, improving the teacher team organizationally and politically; establish a system of close contact with the masses, with the school leadership often going to the poor and lower-middle peasants to seek opinions, participate in meetings called by the poor and lower-middle peasants, or regularly hold poor and lower-middle peasant symposiums, listening to the voices of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and placing the school under the supervision of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

3. Combine teaching with the three great revolutionary movements, using the actual struggles in the countryside as the classroom, and letting revolutionary teachers and students directly participate in the intense class struggles and production struggles in the local area. They combine the school's class education with the actual class struggles in the countryside, combine labor education with the actual production struggles in the countryside. They take the poor and lower-middle peasants as their teachers, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, carry out revolutionary criticism, treating participation in labor as a regular course. Whatever the three great revolutionary movements need, they do it in teaching, truly learning the knowledge of class struggle and production struggle that directly serves the three great revolutionary movements while transforming their thoughts and raising proletarian awareness.

4. On the basis of criticizing old textbooks, thoroughly reform teaching content. They use Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks for political and language courses, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide and solve problems in other courses. Revolutionary teachers and students, following Chairman Mao's teachings, went to the poor and lower-middle peasants, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, compiled local teaching materials, including the family history and village history of the poor and lower-middle peasants, good people and good deeds in the Cultural Revolution in the local area, stories of local revolutionary masses loving Chairman Mao, the experiences of revolutionary teachers and students in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and local agricultural knowledge, etc.

5. Meet the demands of the poor and lower-middle peasants and serve them. Revolutionary teachers and students follow Chairman Mao's teachings, think what the poor and lower-middle peasants think, and urgently address what the poor and lower-middle peasants urgently need, starting from the interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and improving the school management. All 18 elementary schools in the commune have set up 28 Mao Zedong Thought kindergarten classes, organizing preschool children to receive Mao Zedong Thought education, making children love Chairman Mao from a young age, planting the red roots of Mao Zedong Thought, and allowing poor and lower-middle peasant women to concentrate on revolution and production. They also, according to Chairman Mao's instruction of "thrift in running all other undertakings," set up junior high school classes in four complete elementary schools without increasing teachers or equipment. To reduce the burden on the poor and lower-middle peasants, the schools made do with what they had, reduced fees, consolidated and developed the 11 brigade-run elementary schools. Now, every brigade in this commune has a school, elementary schools do not leave the village, and middle schools do not leave the commune, greatly convenience the poor and lower-middle peasants. Some schools have also set up agricultural study classes, training whatever personnel the production brigades need, meeting the needs of rural socialist construction development, and the poor and lower-middle peasants are very satisfied.

    高举毛主席教育革命的光辉旗帜　从广大贫下中农的利益出发
    大破修正主义教育路线　大立无产阶级教育路线
    本溪县山城子公社小学广大革命师生和贫下中农，在支左部队军训队的帮助下，在教学思想、教学体制、教学内容、方法和办学形式等方面进行了一系列改革
    据新华社沈阳电　辽宁省本溪县山城子公社小学广大革命师生在支左部队军训队的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展革命大批判，大破修正主义教育路线，大立无产阶级教育路线。他们针对农村特点，从贫下中农的利益出发，进行教育革命，受到广大贫下中农的热烈赞扬和支持。
    山城子公社地处山区。全公社共有七所完全小学，十一所队办小学，师生员工共二千六百余人。在去年三月开始复课闹革命的时候，有些教师对山村学校搞教育革命缺乏信心。军训队的同志认为，产生这种思想的原因，在于对修正主义教育路线批得不深透，破得不彻底，修正主义教育路线的流毒没有肃清，因此对修正主义教育路线恨得不深，对进行教育革命，大立无产阶级教育路线决心不大，信心不足。于是，军训队的同志帮助革命师生大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，并且把学习班办到贫下中农中去，同贫下中农一起活学活用毛泽东思想，一起参加劳动，一起斗私批修，一起开展“三忆三谈三想”活动：即一忆旧社会压迫的苦，谈新社会的甜，想毛主席的恩情；二忆旧教育制度对贫下中农的毒害，谈无产阶级教育革命的伟大意义，想毛主席教育革命光辉思想的英明正确；三忆十七年来教育战线上阶级斗争的历史，谈当前学校两条路线斗争的新形势，想自己对教育革命的责任。在学习班里，革命师生学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，听苦大仇深的老贫农控诉旧社会的阶级压迫苦，狠揭中国赫鲁晓夫在农村复辟资本主义的罪行，受到了深刻的阶级教育，增强了对贫下中农的阶级感情，提高了阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟。毛主席教导我们：不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。因此，要立无产阶级教育路线，首先必须从“破”字入手，把修正主义教育路线揭深揭透，批倒批臭，肃清其流毒。认识提高后，广大革命师生和贫下中农一道，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，口诛笔伐，打响了一场围剿中国赫鲁晓夫及其推行的修正主义教育路线的“人民战争”，全公社各学校迅速掀起了一个革命大批判的高潮。
    毛主席为我们提出了教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流，公然篡改毛主席制定的这一无产阶级教育方针，疯狂仇视和反对学习毛泽东思想，推行修正主义教育路线。许多革命师生以自己亲身所受的毒害，愤怒揭发和控诉中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义教育路线，毒害青少年，妄图把贫下中农的后代培养成修正主义苗子的滔天罪行。革命师生清楚地看到了修正主义教育路线使学生脱离阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验这三项伟大革命运动，为资产阶级培养接班人、为复辟资本主义服务的反动本质。许多师生列举大量事实，揭露和控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育界的代理人推行的修正主义教育路线，在农村排挤和打击贫下中农子女的种种罪行。受迫害的贫下中农子女在革命大批判中，振臂高呼：“造修正主义教育路线的反，我们造定了！打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”随着革命大批判的深入开展，革命师生的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。他们对中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义教育路线越来越痛恨，进行教育革命的决心越来越大，信心越来越足，为贫下中农服务的思想越来越牢固。广大革命师生和贫下中农一起，高举毛主席教育革命的光辉旗帜，以毛主席的“五·七”指示为纲，在教育革命实践中发扬了敢想、敢干的革命精神，在教学思想、教学体制、教学内容、方法和办学形式等方面，进行了一系列的改革。
    一、教学工作以“三忠于”为指导思想，把忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线当作一切工作的根本，贯穿到一切活动的始终。革命师生通过在教学工作中，认真深入开展“三忠于”活动，深深体会到对毛主席胸怀一个“忠”字就是最大的“公”，从而进一步掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮，把教学工作推向了一个崭新的阶段。
    二、彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，让贫下中农参加领导，改变旧的领导体制。公社教育革命委员会和各小学的革命三结合领导小组都吸收贫下中农代表参加；选派优秀的贫下中农子女当教师，从组织上、政治上改善教师队伍；建立密切联系群众的制度，学校领导班子经常深入贫下中农中去征求意见，参加贫下中农召开的有关会议，或定期召开贫下中农座谈会，倾听贫下中农的呼声，使学校永远置于广大贫下中农的监督之下。
    三、把教学和三大革命运动紧密结合起来，以农村斗争实际作课堂，让革命师生直接投身于本地区轰轰烈烈的阶级斗争和生产斗争实际。他们把学校的阶级教育和农村阶级斗争实际相结合，劳动教育和农村生产斗争实际相结合。拜贫下中农为老师，和贫下中农一起开展革命大批判，把参加劳动作为一门正课。三大革命运动需要什么，他们在教学中就搞什么，既改造了思想，提高了无产阶级觉悟，又真正学到了直接服务于三大革命运动的阶级斗争和生产斗争知识。
    四、在批判旧教材的基础上，彻底改革教学内容。他们以毛主席著作作为政治、语文课的基本教材，其它课的教学都用毛泽东思想作统帅，用毛泽东思想回答和解决问题。广大革命师生遵照毛主席的教导，深入贫下中农中去，和贫下中农一起编写乡土教材，其中有贫下中农的家史、村史，文化大革命中本地的好人好事，当地革命群众热爱毛主席的故事，革命师生活学活用毛泽东思想，斗私批修的体会，本地的农业知识等等。
    五、满足贫下中农的要求，为贫下中农服务。革命师生遵循毛主席的教导，想贫下中农所想，急贫下中农所急，从贫下中农利益出发，改进了办学形式。全公社十八所小学开办了二十八个毛泽东思想幼儿班，把学龄前儿童组织起来进行毛泽东思想教育，让孩子们从小热爱毛主席，扎下毛泽东思想红根，使贫下中农妇女集中精力抓革命促生产。他们还根据毛主席“勤俭办一切其他事业”的教导，在小学不增教员、不添设备的条件下，在四个完全小学附设了初中班。为了减轻贫下中农的负担，学校因陋就简，减收费用，巩固并发展了十一所队办小学。现在这个公社队队有学校，小学不出村，中学不出公社，大大方便了贫下中农。有的学校还设立了农业学习班，生产队需要什么人就培养什么人，满足了农村社会主义建设发展的需要，贫下中农十分满意。
