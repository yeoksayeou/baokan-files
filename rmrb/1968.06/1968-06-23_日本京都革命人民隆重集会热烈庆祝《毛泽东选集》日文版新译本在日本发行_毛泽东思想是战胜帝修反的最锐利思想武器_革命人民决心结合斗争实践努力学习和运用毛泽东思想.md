Revolutionary people of Kyoto held a grand meeting on June 20 to enthusiastically celebrate the publication of the new Japanese translation of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in Japan. They expressed their determination to combine the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought with their practical struggles against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and modern revisionism.

A large portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao was prominently displayed at the front of the meeting venue. A huge banner at the front read: "Navigating the seas relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."

At the beginning of the meeting, all attendees loudly recited quotations from Chairman Mao and the preface written by Vice Chairman Lin Biao for the reprint of "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

Small, a deputy director of the Kyoto Prefecture (authentic) branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, delivered a speech at the celebration. He said that the great Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for world revolution and the sharpest weapon to defeat the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and modern revisionism.

He said that imperialists, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionists are most afraid of Mao Zedong Thought. They tremble in fear before the great Mao Zedong Thought. They desperately oppose the great Mao Zedong Thought, but all their efforts are in vain.

Small emphasized that only by combining Mao Zedong Thought with the revolutionary practice in Japan can the struggles of the Japanese people achieve victory.

A responsible person from the preparatory committee of the left-wing faction of the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Yoshizai Koji, was invited to give a report at the meeting. He said that to achieve revolutionary victory, the Japanese people must grasp the three magic weapons proposed by Chairman Mao for the Chinese Communist Party to defeat the enemy in the Chinese revolution: party building, armed struggle, and the united front.

Yoshizai said that we must build a party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, that practices criticism and self-criticism, and that is connected with the masses.

Yoshizai said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The central task and highest form of revolution is armed seizure of political power, solving problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is always correct.'"

Yoshizai continued, "The revolutionary people of Japan must arm themselves with Chairman Mao's great thought."

Yoshizai stressed, "We must study Chairman Mao's works as instructed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao: 'Study with questions in mind, learn actively and apply actively, combine learning with use, learn first what is urgently needed, see immediate results, and focus on the 'use' with great effort.' We must truly achieve learning through practice and combining it with the reality of the Japanese revolution."

The meeting passed a resolution expressing their determination to advance the study of Mao Zedong Thought under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to launch anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles, to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism, and to strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

The revolutionary theater troupe "Gear" of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team performed revolutionary cultural programs at the meeting, which were warmly received.

At the end of the meeting, the attendees sang "Navigating the seas relies on the helmsman" and "The Internationale," and enthusiastically shouted for a long time: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

    新华社二十二日讯　东京消息：日本京都革命人民二十日隆重集会，热烈庆祝《毛泽东选集》日文版新译本在日本出版发行，并且表示要结合反对美日反动派和现代修正主义的斗争实际，进一步努力学习和运用伟大的毛泽东思想。
    庆祝会会场正面中央悬挂着伟大导师毛主席的巨幅画像。在正面的巨大横幅上写着：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。
    庆祝会开始时，出席会议的全体人员高声朗读毛主席语录和林彪副主席为《毛主席语录》写的再版前言。
    日中友好协会京都府（正统）总部副理事长小野信尔在庆祝会上发表讲话说，伟大的毛泽东思想是世界革命的指导方针，是战胜美日反动派和现代修正主义的最锐利的武器。
    他说，帝国主义者、各国反动派、现代修正主义者最害怕毛泽东思想，他们在伟大的毛泽东思想面前吓得发抖。他们拚命地反对伟大的毛泽东思想。但是，这一切都是徒劳的。
    小野强调指出，只有把毛泽东思想与日本革命实践结合起来，才能使日本人民的斗争获得胜利。
    日本共产党东京都委员会（左派）筹备会负责人安斋库治应邀在会上作了报告。他说，日本人民要取得革命的胜利，必须掌握毛主席提出的中国共产党在中国革命中战胜敌人的三个主要法宝：党的建设、武装斗争和统一战线。
    安斋说，我们必须建立一个用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的、坚持批评与自我批评的、联系人民群众的党。
    安斋说，毛主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    安斋接着说，日本革命人民必须用毛主席的这一伟大思想武装起来。
    安斋强调说，我们学习毛主席著作必须象林彪副主席所指示的那样：“要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”，切实做到在斗争实践中学习，同日本革命的实际结合起来。
    会上通过一项决议，表示要在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗指引下，进一步加强学习毛泽东思想，开展反帝反修斗争，为废除日美“安全条约”、反对复活日本军国主义，争取恢复日中邦交而努力。
    日本革命剧团齿轮座的毛泽东思想宣传队，在会上演出了革命文艺节目，受到热烈欢迎。
    集会结束时，到会群众高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和《国际歌》，并且经久不息地热情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
