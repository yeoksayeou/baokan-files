The revolutionary model opera, this pearl in the treasure trove of proletarian literature and art, has shone brightly on the eastern horizon since a few years ago, immediately causing a sensation throughout China, shocking the world, and opening a brilliant new chapter in the history of human literature and art. Revolutionary literary and art warriors on the front lines of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have greatly heightened their consciousness of the struggle between the two lines. A proletarian revolutionary literary and art army, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, is gradually taking shape. The model opera troops are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully express the revolutionary fighting spirit and abundant political enthusiasm unleashed by the Cultural Revolution, and ensure that the performance achieves even greater victories.

New China News Agency, June 29th: In the great situation where our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has already achieved decisive victories, the model troupes of the new proletarian revolutionary literature and art personally cultivated and led by Comrade Jiang Qing—Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 1, the China Peking Opera House, the Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Ballet Troupe, and the Central Orchestra—will perform for the first time in 1968 on "July 1," the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, presenting six revolutionary model operas that shine with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the capital.

The revolutionary model operas to be performed this time include the revolutionary modern Peking opera "Sha Jianhuai," the revolutionary modern ballet "Red Detachment of Women," the revolutionary modern symphony "Sha Jianhuai," and the revolutionary modern Peking operas "The Capture of Tiger Mountain," "The Harbor," and "The Red Lantern," which they learned from the Shanghai Peking Opera House and the Shandong Peking Opera Troupe.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Literature and art should become a component part of the whole revolutionary machine, serving as a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy, helping the people to unite as one and fight against the enemy." The six revolutionary model operas to be performed this time, together with the revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Red Lantern" and the revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl," have long since demonstrated to the revolutionary people of the whole country and the world with their clear political content of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving proletarian politics, and serving socialism, as well as their strong artistic charm, the absolute correctness and tremendous power of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line. In the current situation where hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in our country are following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advancing with the momentum of victory, and striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this performance is a new offensive launched by revolutionary literary and art warriors using the revolutionary model opera as a sharp weapon of class struggle, further promoting the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a new offensive launched by revolutionary literary and art warriors against the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art black line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents.

"Our literature and art are for the people. They are first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and for the workers, peasants, and soldiers to use." Under the illumination of this brilliant thought of the great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary model opera, this pearl in the treasure trove of proletarian literature and art, has shone brightly on the eastern horizon since a few years ago, immediately causing a sensation throughout China, shocking the world, and opening a brilliant new chapter in the history of human literature and art. However, while revolutionary people at home and abroad highly praise and enthusiastically welcome it, a small handful of class enemies at home and abroad are terrified and enraged. Even when Comrade Jiang Qing led revolutionary literary and art warriors to create revolutionary model operas, they used every means to oppose and sabotage, attempting to strangle this revolutionary new thing in its cradle. Even after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, these revolutionary modern Peking operas, revolutionary modern ballets, and revolutionary modern symphonies had thoroughly overthrown the rule of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties on the stage. The Chinese Khrushchev and a small handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders with him as their backer still could not accept their defeat, dreaming of restoring their lost paradise, playing all sorts of tricks, and attempting to negate the revolutionary model operas. However, the broad revolutionary literary and art warriors on the front lines of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, armed with great Mao Zedong Thought, have seen through the evil plots of this small handful of class enemies, realizing that this struggle is a continuation of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines that had been waged around the revolutionary model operas before the Cultural Revolution. They firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," hold high the banner of "it is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," and through the work of purging the ranks, have exposed one by one those traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks to promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art black line and sabotage the revolutionary model operas. They have also launched a thorough and prolonged revolutionary criticism and struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Over the past two years, in the practical struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary literary and art warriors of each model troupe have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. They have become even more loving of the great leader Chairman Mao, more determined to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life, and more hateful of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art black line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. Their consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has reached an unprecedented height, their spiritual outlook has undergone great changes, and a proletarian revolutionary literary and art army, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, is gradually taking shape. Thus, the evil plots and tricks of a small handful of class enemies to oppose and sabotage the revolutionary model operas have been thoroughly smashed, and the revolutionary model operas have more firmly occupied the stage of literature and art in our country, shining brilliantly forever!

Recently, the revolutionary literary and art warriors of the model troupes in the capital have universally restudied Chairman Mao's great teaching of "grasp revolution, promote production." They believe that doing well in this performance is a political battle to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, with the actual action of "grasp revolution, promote production," fight against a small handful of class enemies at home and abroad. They have expressed their determination to turn the stage into a battlefield for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, the theater into a battlefield for launching a revolutionary criticism and struggle, and the performance into a large classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They are determined to fully express the revolutionary fighting spirit and abundant political enthusiasm unleashed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary masses of Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 1 and the China Peking Opera House have specially arranged to firmly grasp class struggle and launch a revolutionary criticism and struggle during the performance period, striving to ensure that proletarian politics command business, start from grasping the revolution, further promote the thought revolution of people, and ensure that this performance achieves even greater victories.

    用革命样板戏宣传毛泽东思想伟大胜利
    把舞台作战场彻底摧毁反革命文艺黑线
    江青同志培育和率领的无产阶级革命新文艺的样板团在“七一”公演样板戏
    革命样板戏这个无产阶级文艺宝库中的明珠，几年以前在东方地平线上出现以后，立即轰动了全中国，震惊了全世界，在人类文艺史上揭开了光辉灿烂的新篇章。战斗在无产阶级文化大革命第一线的广大革命文艺战士，两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高。一支无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命文艺大军正在逐步形成。样板团文艺战士决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把文化大革命焕发出来的革命战斗精神和饱满的政治热情充分表现出来，保证公演取得更大的胜利
    新华社二十九日讯　在我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，由江青同志亲自培育和率领的无产阶级革命新文艺的样板团——北京京剧一团、中国京剧院、工农兵芭蕾舞剧团和中央乐团，将在“七一”——中国共产党诞生四十七周年的大喜日子里，举行一九六八年首次公演，再度向首都广大工农兵革命群众演出六个闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光芒的革命样板戏。
    这次上演的革命样板戏，有革命现代京剧《沙家浜》，革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，革命现代交响音乐《沙家浜》，还有他们向上海京剧院、山东京剧团学习的革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》、《海港》和《奇袭白虎团》。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”这次演出的六个革命样板戏和革命现代京剧《红灯记》、革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》一起，早就以它们为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务、为社会主义服务的鲜明的政治内容和强烈的艺术魅力，向全中国、全世界革命人民展示了毛主席革命文艺路线的无比正确和巨大威力。在当前我国亿万革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，这次公演，就是革命文艺战士用革命样板戏这个阶级斗争的锐利武器，进一步宣传毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，进一步宣传无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是革命文艺战士向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义文艺黑线发起的新进攻。
      “我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”在伟大领袖毛主席这一光辉思想的照耀下，革命样板戏这个无产阶级文艺宝库中的明珠几年以前在东方地平线上出现以后，立即轰动了全中国，震惊了全世界，在人类文艺史上揭开了光辉灿烂的新篇章。但是，在中外革命人民高度赞扬、热烈欢呼的同时，国内外一小撮阶级敌人却怕得要死，恨得要命。早在江青同志率领革命文艺战士创作革命样板戏的时候，他们就千方百计地反对和破坏，妄图把这个革命的新生事物扼杀在摇篮之中。直到无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，这些革命现代京剧、革命现代芭蕾舞剧、革命现代交响音乐已经彻底打倒了帝王将相、才子佳人在舞台上的统治地位，中国赫鲁晓夫和以他为总后台的一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，仍然不甘心他们的失败，梦想恢复他们失去的天堂，玩弄种种阴谋诡计，妄图否定革命样板戏。但是，战斗在无产阶级文化大革命第一线的广大革命文艺战士，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，识破了这一小撮阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，认识到这一场斗争，就是文化大革命以前围绕着革命样板戏而展开的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的继续。他们牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，通过清理队伍的工作，把那些混入革命队伍推行反革命修正主义文艺黑线、破坏革命样板戏的一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和其他反革命分子一个个揪了出来，并且对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派展开了深入持久的革命大批判。两年多来，在无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践中，各个革命样板团的革命文艺战士紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，活学活用毛主席著作。他们对伟大领袖毛主席更加热爱，为工农兵服务一辈子的革命决心更加坚定，同时对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义文艺黑线更加痛恨，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟空前提高，精神面貌发生了很大的变化，一支无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命文艺大军正在逐步形成。这样，就从根本上粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人反对和破坏革命样板戏的阴谋诡计，使革命样板戏更加牢固地占领了我国文艺舞台，永放光芒！
    最近，首都各样板团的革命文艺战士，普遍重新学习了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导。他们认为，搞好这次公演，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“抓革命，促生产”的实际行动同国内外一小撮阶级敌人进行斗争的一场政治仗。他们纷纷表示，一定要把舞台当作宣传毛泽东思想的阵地，把剧场当作开展革命大批判的战场，把演出当作活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂，决心把无产阶级文化大革命焕发出来的革命战斗精神和饱满的政治热情充分表现出来。北京京剧一团和中国京剧院的革命群众，还专门安排了在演出期间坚持狠抓阶级斗争、坚持开展革命大批判的活动，努力做到以无产阶级政治统帅业务，从抓革命入手，进一步促进人的思想革命化，保证这次公演取得更大的胜利。
