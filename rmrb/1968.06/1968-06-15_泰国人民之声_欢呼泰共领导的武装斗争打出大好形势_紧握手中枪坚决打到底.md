The Voice of the Thai People radio station broadcasted an article on the 11th, enthusiastically praising the armed revolutionary struggle of the Thai people under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party. The article highlights that the political landscape of Thailand's vast rural areas has undergone a significant transformation, and the Thai revolution is presenting a favorable situation. The article, titled "Resolutely Carry the People's War to the End, Victory Belongs to the People," emphasizes that without the people's revolutionary armed forces, there would be nothing for the people, and there would be no revolutionary victory.

The article states that in the past, the Thanom-Kittikachorn sellout clique could commit atrocities and arbitrarily slaughter rural people. Now, in areas where the people's armed forces are active, they can no longer act with impunity. The U.S.-Thanom clique can no longer move freely, and local reactionary officials and secret agents can no longer run rampant.

The article states that within the areas of people's armed activities, due to the protection of the people's armed forces, the people's freedoms and rights are guaranteed, and people's livelihoods and mutual interactions can proceed normally. The Thai people deeply feel that "without armed struggle, the people would never have a day of relief."

The article states that the people's armed forces are rapidly developing and growing stronger, dealing heavy blows to the U.S.-Thanom clique. This clique has launched a frenzied armed suppression against the people's revolutionary armed forces. However, they have not only failed to extinguish the flames of the people's armed struggle but have been repeatedly defeated by the people's armed forces. The people's armed forces have grown stronger in the battles against the enemy's "encirclement and suppression," becoming the hope of the Thai people in their struggle for national independence and people's democracy.

The article states that the U.S.-Thanom clique's armed suppression cannot stop the development of the Thai people's revolutionary armed struggle. Therefore, under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, the Thanom-Kittikachorn clique has turned to playing political tricks, announcing the issuance of a fake constitution and holding sham elections.

The article states that the new political deception of the U.S.-Thanom clique will absolutely not fool the Thai people. The Thai people have resolved to carry the armed struggle to the end. This is a precious lesson learned by the Thai people over many years with their blood and lives. As pointed out by a spokesperson for the Thai Communist Party: "Armed struggle is the only way for the Thai people to expel U.S. imperialism, overthrow the Thanom-Kittikachorn sellout clique, and strive for the true independence and democracy of the country."

The article emphasizes that the Thai people will not lay down their guns but will hold them even tighter, resolutely carry the people's war to the end, until they drive the American aggressors out of Thailand, overthrow the Thanom-Kittikachorn sellout clique, and establish an independent, democratic, and prosperous new Thailand.

    “泰国人民之声”欢呼泰共领导的武装斗争打出大好形势
    紧握手中枪坚决打到底
    新华社十三日讯  “泰国人民之声”电台十一日广播一篇文章，热烈欢呼泰国共产党领导下的泰国人民革命武装斗争，使泰国广大农村的政治面貌焕然一新，泰国革命呈现一派大好形势。这篇题为《坚决把人民战争进行到底，胜利一定属于人民》的文章强调指出，没有人民革命武装，就没有人民的一切，就没有革命的胜利。
    文章说，从前，他侬—巴博卖国集团可以为非作歹，任意屠杀农村人民群众。现在，在有人民武装活动的地区，它们不能为所欲为了，美国—他侬集团再也不能自由自在地进去行动了，地方的反动官员、暗探特务再也不能横行霸道了。
    文章说，在人民武装活动的区域内，由于得到人民武装的保护，人民群众的自由权利获得了保证，人民的谋生和互相往来能够正常进行。泰国人民深深地体会到：“如果没有武装斗争，人民就决无抬头仰首之日”。
    文章说，人民武装迅速发展壮大，沉重地打击了美国—他侬集团。这个集团对人民革命武装进行了疯狂的武装镇压。但是，它们不仅无法扑灭人民武装斗争的烈火，反而一次又一次地被人民武装打得惨败。人民武装在反击敌人“围剿”的战斗中壮大起来，成为泰国人民争取民族独立、人民民主的希望。
    文章说，美国—他侬集团的武力镇压不能阻止泰国人民革命武装斗争的发展，因此，在美帝国主义的指使下，他侬—巴博集团转而玩弄政治大欺骗，宣布颁布伪宪法，举行假选举。
    文章说，美帝—他侬集团的新的政治大骗局也绝对欺骗不了泰国人民，泰国人民下定决心要把武装斗争进行到底。这是泰国人民多年来用血和生命换来的宝贵的经验教训。正如泰共发言人所指出的：“武装斗争才是泰国人民驱逐美帝国主义、推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团和争取国家的真正独立、民主的唯一出路”。
    文章强调说：泰国人民决不放下手中枪，而要更加紧握手中枪，坚决把人民战争进行到底，直到把美国强盗赶出泰国，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团，建立起一个独立、民主、繁荣的新泰国。
