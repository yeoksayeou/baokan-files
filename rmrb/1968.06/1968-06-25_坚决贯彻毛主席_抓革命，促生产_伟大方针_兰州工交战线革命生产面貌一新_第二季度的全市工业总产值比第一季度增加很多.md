The revolutionary and production situation on the industrial and transportation front in Lanzhou is getting better and better as the revolutionary masses and the broad masses of workers resolutely implement and carry out Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, all large and medium-sized factories and mines in Lanzhou have achieved revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones, and revolutionary committees have been established.

The members of the newly born revolutionary committees, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "the most fundamental thing in the reform of state organs is to link up with the masses," have gone deep among the masses, relied closely on the masses, and played an increasingly great role in leading the masses to grasp revolution and promote production.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes in the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The revolutionary committees at all levels on the industrial and transportation front in Lanzhou, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, have led the broad revolutionary masses of workers to launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, exposing one by one the unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries, thoroughly criticizing their counter-revolutionary crimes, greatly raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses of workers, and powerfully promoting the development of production. Many advanced factories and enterprises have become even more advanced, and the revolutionary and production situation of some backward factories and enterprises has also taken on a new look. The production of many factories and enterprises has increased significantly. Especially since the second quarter, the city's total industrial output value has increased significantly compared to the first quarter. Coal, gasoline, kerosene, diesel, lubricating oil, synthetic ammonia, ammonium nitrate, wool, soap, toothpaste, and enamel products all overfulfilled the state production plan in May.

The revolutionary workers on the industrial and transportation front in Lanzhou have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "further economize and make revolution," and launched activities to increase production and practice economy. The revolutionary workers in many factories not only pay attention to increasing product output but also especially pay attention to improving product quality, saving raw materials, and striving to produce more high-quality products for the state.

    新华社兰州二十二日电　兰州地区工业交通战线无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，使革命和生产形势越来越好。
    在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，兰州市各大中型厂矿已经全部实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，建立了革命委员会。
    新生的革命委员会的成员遵照毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，深入群众，紧紧依靠群众，在带领群众狠抓革命，猛促生产中，发挥出越来越大的作用。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”兰州市工业交通战线的各级革命委员会遵照毛主席的伟大教导，带领广大革命职工向一小撮阶级敌人展开了猛烈进攻，把死不悔改的走资派、叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子，一个个揪了出来，彻底批判他们的反革命罪行，大大提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地推动了生产的发展。许多先进厂矿企业更加先进，一些后进厂矿企业的革命和生产面貌也焕然一新。很多厂矿企业生产大幅度增长。特别是进入第二季度以来，全市工业总产值比第一季度增加很多。煤炭、汽油、煤油、柴油、润滑油、合成氨、硝铵、呢绒、肥皂、牙膏、搪瓷等产品，五月份都超额完成了国家生产计划。
    兰州市工业交通战线上的革命职工坚决响应毛主席提出的“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大号召，开展了增加生产、厉行节约的活动。许多工厂的革命职工不仅注意增加产品产量，而且特别注意提高产品质量，节约原料材料，争取为国家多生产优质产品。
