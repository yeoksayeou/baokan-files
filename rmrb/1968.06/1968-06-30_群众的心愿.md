Now it is the height of summer, but in the boiler room of the No. 2 workshop of the Tianjin Dyeing and Finishing Factory, a cool breeze is blowing, and it is not very hot. What is the reason for this?

One day in early spring, the director of the revolutionary committee and old revolutionary cadre, Old Feng, and the member of the revolutionary committee and old revolutionary cadre, Old Gao, were participating in workshop labor when some veteran workers raised the issue of lowering the temperature in the boiler room. The veteran workers said, "In the past, the factory's capitalist roaders did not care about us workers. The work of lowering the temperature in the boiler room was done every year, but the problem was never solved. Now that we workers have taken the reins, it is time to solve this problem once and for all!" The veteran workers' words deeply moved Old Feng and Old Gao. They recalled that in the past summers, due to poor temperature control in the boiler room, the temperature often reached over forty degrees, and workers frequently fainted from heatstroke. Sometimes it was so hot that they could not work, and the entire workshop had to stop production.

The issue of lowering the temperature in the boiler room not only affects the health of the boiler room workers and the completion of the state's production tasks but also is a major issue of whether the newly established revolutionary committee will follow which path and serve whom. At a full meeting of the revolutionary committee, everyone reviewed Chairman Mao's two brilliant works, "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Pay Attention to Methods of Work." Using Chairman Mao's teachings of "caring for the people's pains and itches" and "genuinely and sincerely working for the people's interests" as a weapon, they severely criticized the capitalist roaders within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, for their bourgeois style of being detached from the masses. They decided to send Old Gao and the revolutionary mass representative, Little Wang, to work with the workers to immediately address this issue.

After repeated research, the best solution was to open a door on the east wall of the boiler room to bring in natural wind. However, this involved another issue: the family of female worker Zhang Yu'an had built a makeshift room against this wall outside the factory. To open a door in this wall, they had to first solve the housing problem for Zhang Yu'an's family. Old Gao and Little Wang recalled Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our army is entirely for the people's liberation, and it is thoroughly working in the people's interests." They resolutely said, "To relieve the suffering of our class brothers, to ensure that our newly established revolutionary committee forever follows the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, even if there are enormous difficulties, we must open this wall!" The revolutionary committee mobilized the masses to find a solution, and quickly found new accommodations for Zhang Yu'an's family.

The door and window on the east wall were opened, and from then on, the boiler room, which was once a "steam room," became a battlefield where workers fiercely grasp revolution and vigorously promote production. The workers excitedly said, "The revolutionary committee thinks what the workers think and hurries to address what the workers are concerned about. It truly understands our hearts!"

    群众的心愿

    现在已是盛夏季节，天津人民染整厂二车间锅炉房里，清风阵阵，并不怎么热。这是怎么回事呢？
    今年初春的一天，厂革委会主任、革命领导干部老冯，和革委会常委、革命领导干部老高在参加车间劳动时，有的老工人向他们提出了锅炉房降温的问题。老工人说：“过去，厂里的走资派心里没有咱们工人，锅炉房降温工作虽然年年搞，可是年年不解决问题。如今咱们工人掌了印把子，这个问题到了彻底解决的时候了！”老工人的一席话，使老冯和老高深受感动。他们想起往年夏天，锅炉房因降温不好，温度高达四十多度，常常发生工人中暑晕倒的现象；有时热得实在不能干活，只好全车间停工。
    锅炉房的降温问题，不仅关系到锅炉工人的身体健康和国家生产任务的完成，而且是新生的革命委员会走什么道路，为谁服务的大问题。在革委会全体会议上，大家重温了毛主席《为人民服务》、《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》两篇光辉著作。用毛主席“关心群众的痛痒”“真心实意地为群众谋利益”的教导为武器，狠批以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派脱离群众的国民党作风，决定派老高和革命群众代表小王，同工人一起，立即着手解决这个问题。
    经过反复研究，最好的办法是在锅炉房的东墙上开一个门，把自然风引进来。可是这牵涉到另外一个问题：本厂女工张玉安的家属，在外边靠墙搭了间简易房子，要在这堵墙上开门，必须先给张玉安的家属解决住房问题。老高和小王想起了毛主席的教导：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”便斩钉截铁地说：“为了解除阶级兄弟的痛苦，为了保证我们新生的革委会永远沿着毛主席指引的方向前进，就是有天大的困难，也要把这堵墙拆开！”革委会发动群众想办法，很快给张玉安的家属找到了新的住处。
    东墙上的门窗打开了，从此以后，锅炉房由过去的“大蒸笼”，变成了工人狠抓革命、猛促生产的战场。工人们激动地说：“革委会想工人所想，急工人所急，真是和咱们心贴心啊！”
