The progressive Indian magazine "Patriot" recently published an article titled "India's Food Problem and Its Solution," which exposed the brutal exploitation and plunder of Indian peasants by imperialism, Indian landlords, and big capitalists. The article pointed out that the root cause of India's food crisis is the insane aggression of American imperialism and the evil rule of Indian landlords and big capitalists. Therefore, only by driving out American imperialism and overthrowing the reactionary rule of landlords and big capitalists can India's famine problem be solved.

The article in "Patriot" first pointed out: "The reason for the severe food crisis in our country is the concentration of land, usury, and hoarding by merchants. Among India's 500 million people, 400 million rely on agriculture for a living. Of these, 150 million people have no land and work as day laborers on others' land. Their situation is as miserable as that of slaves. According to exaggerated official figures, they work an average of 126 days a year, and the rest of the time they are hungry or half-starved, surviving on tree roots and leaves. Landlords and usurers take advantage of this to lend them money. When giving them work, they pay them wages below market prices as interest on the loans. The remaining 150 million farmers either have 3 to 5 acres of land or are sharecroppers, or they have a bit of land and rent some more. They are so poor that they cannot even afford fertilizer or pesticides, let alone seeds. To repay debts, they have even mortgaged their land and houses to usurers... According to official figures, usury in India amounts to 30 billion rupees per year!

"Moreover, most of the land in our country is in the hands of large landlords... Our country has hundreds of landlords who own between 2,000 and 6,000 acres of land. Thus, the large landlords and usurers: (1) store half of the rice produced by millions of farmers in their own granaries; (2) with 30 billion rupees in usury, they control the necks of 300 million farmers, seizing at least 15 billion rupees worth of rice each year; (3) at harvest time, they buy up all the rice, creating artificial famines, and then sell it back to the people at five to ten times the price, making tens of millions of rupees in profit.

"The second reason is the wasteland owned by large landlords. India has 80 million acres of immediately cultivable wasteland. If we calculate 10 maunds per acre, we can harvest 900 million maunds (2.4 billion maunds)! Even if we eat a lot, we will still have a surplus of grain for export. Because the grain we import now is less than 100 million maunds! To import this grain, we have to give the Americans 5 billion rupees every year!"

The article in "Patriot" states that even excluding the 80 million acres of wasteland, the current 450 million acres of cultivable land in India can not only solve the food problem but also have a surplus. "If we can liberate 300 million farmers from the exploitation of landlords, the grain production of Indian land can feed more than 500 million people."

The article in "Patriot" further points out: American imperialism is the protector of Indian landlords and big capitalists. The American ruling class believes that as long as India's famine is maintained, India's dependence on American grain can be maintained. Through so-called food "aid," the United States not only extorts about 5 billion rupees from India every year but also obtains a series of colonial privileges. The United States uses the pressure of food "aid" to force India to reduce the area of tobacco and cotton cultivation and to import American raw cotton and tobacco leaves at American prices. The United States also allowed India to establish some factories, but all the machinery had to be imported from the United States with high-interest loans. The United States also made large-scale investments in India, with profits reaching 30 to 40 percent.

The article in "Patriot" points out: "On the one hand, it is mainly American imperialism, and on the other hand, it is its two lackeys—the Tatas and Birlas (note: India's big capitalists) in the cities and landlords, usurers, and hoarders in the countryside who brutally exploit three hundred million farmers, turning them into beggars. They bring cries for food and unemployment to the remaining 200 million people, of whom more than 190 million (100 million middle peasants and the middle class in the countryside; 95 million people in the cities, including workers, teachers, the petty bourgeoisie, and even the upper class...) are suffering. Every year, at least 100 to 150 million people die of hunger! The Americans have sucked our blood dry! If exploitation continues for a few more years, apart from the bones of the Indian people, nothing will be left!"

"The main enemy of our country, American imperialism, for its own interests, creates famine through the devils in the countryside, intending to destroy our entire nation with hunger. We cannot solve the famine problem without driving them out." Therefore, first: To get rid of the control of these devils, we must first overthrow the landlords, hoarders, and usurers who are the most trusted lackeys of the Americans in the countryside. Farmers must seize the land and obtain land ownership themselves, liberating themselves. This must be done under the leadership of the working class, organizing the peasant movement. The mass movement of peasants to resist evictions, resist lending, resist increased taxes, and seize land must be combined with all (democratic) movements and the great revolutionary struggle for power. In this way, in places where peasant revolutionary bases are established, farmers who are not exploited can quickly increase production and solve the food problem for the people and soldiers.

The article in "Patriot" finally points out: India's revolution must be "surrounding the cities after occupying the countryside." "In India's countryside, there are about 400 million peasants who suffer the most oppression and exploitation and have the deepest hatred for the enemy. They will fight resolutely and for a long time... The direction and focus of all democratic movements in the cities should be towards them." "It must be remembered: this struggle will be a very arduous and long-term struggle involving bloodshed. Taking this path can eliminate the enemy; otherwise, we will be eliminated. Apart from this, there is no way to permanently get rid of the famine."

### 印度进步刊物《爱国者》周刊指出  美帝和反动派的压榨是印度粮荒的根源  印度人民只有赶走美帝推翻反动统治才有活路

    印度进步刊物《爱国者》周刊指出
    美帝和反动派的压榨是印度粮荒的根源
    印度人民只有赶走美帝推翻反动统治才有活路
    本报讯　印度进步刊物《爱国者》周刊不久前刊登了一篇题为《印度的粮食问题及其解决途径》的文章，揭露了帝国主义和印度大地主、大资产阶级对印度农民的残酷压榨和掠夺的血淋淋的事实。文章指出了印度粮荒的根源，是美帝国主义的疯狂侵略和印度大地主、大资产阶级的罪恶统治。因此，只有赶走美帝国主义，推翻大地主、大资产阶级的反动统治，才能解决印度的“饥荒问题”。
    《爱国者》的文章首先指出：“我国发生严重的粮食危机的原因是：土地集中，高利贷和商人囤积。印度五亿人口中有四亿人依靠农业过活。其中一亿五千万人没有土地，靠在别人土地上做日工。他们的处境和奴隶一样悲惨。据夸大了的官方数字，他们每年平均工作一百二十六天，此外是饿着或半饿着，吃树根树叶度日。大地主和高利贷者乘机借钱给他们。以后在给他们活干时，以低于市价的工资役使他们，作为借贷的利息。其余一亿五千万农民有三、五印亩地，或者是分益佃农，或者自己有点地也租种一点地。他们穷到不仅谈不上用肥料、农药等增产，而且连种子都吃光了。为了还债，连土地、房基都抵押给高利贷者了……据官方数字，印度高利贷每年达三百亿卢比！
    “另外，我国大部分土地在大焦特达（地主）手里……我国有数以百计的拥有二千至六千印亩土地的大地主。这样，大地主高利贷者就：（一）把千千万万农民所产的一半稻谷放入了自己的仓库；（二）以三百亿卢比高利贷卡着三亿农民的脖子，每年至少把一千五百亿卢比的稻子放入自己仓库；（三）收割时又购买了所有的稻谷，制造人为的饥荒，然后再以五、六倍至十倍的高价卖给人民，掠取数以千万计的卢比。
    “第二个原因是大地主的丢荒地造成的。印度的立即可耕的丢荒地有八千万英亩。如以每英亩产十芒特计，可收获九千万吨（二十四亿芒特）！即使我们大吃，也还会有大量粮食出口。因为我们现在进口的粮食还不到一千万吨！为了进口这些粮食我们每年要给美国佬五十亿卢比！”
    《爱国者》的文章说，即使把八千万英亩的丢荒地除外，目前印度的四亿五千万英亩可耕地，也不仅能够解决粮食问题，而且还有剩余。“如果能把三亿农民从地主的剥削下解放出来，印度土地的粮食产量是可供五亿以上的人口吃用的。”
    《爱国者》的文章接着指出：美国帝国主义是印度大地主、大资产阶级的保护人。美国统治集团认为，永远保持印度的饥荒，就能保持印度对美粮的依赖。而美国通过所谓粮食“援助”，除了每年从印度搜刮五十亿左右卢比外，还取得了一系列殖民特权。美国利用粮食“援助”的压力，强迫印度减少烟、棉种植面积，并按美国价格进口美国原棉和烟叶。美国让印度建立一些工厂，而机器都得从美国以高利贷款进口。美国另外还在印度进行了大规模的投资，所获利润高达百分之三十到四十。
    《爱国者》的文章指出：“一方面主要是美帝国主义，另一方面是它的两个走狗——在城市是塔塔、比拉们（注：即印度的大资本家）在农村是地主高利贷者和囤积者的残酷剥削，使三亿农民变成乞丐。他们给其余二亿人中的一亿九千万以上的人（农村的一亿中农和中产阶级；城市的九千五百万人，包括工人、教职员、小资产阶级，甚至上层人士……）带来了要求粮食的哀号和失业。每年仅仅饿死的人就有一百至一百五十万人！美国佬吸尽了我们的血！剥削再继续几年，不要说还债和利息，除了印度人的骨头外，再也剩不下什么了。”
    “我国的主要敌人美帝国主义为了自己的利益，通过在农村的魔鬼制造饥荒，要以饥饿来毁灭我们整个民族，不赶走他们就解决不了饥荒问题。”因此，第一：要摆脱这些魔鬼的控制，首先要在农村推翻美帝最信任的奴才地主、囤积者和高利贷者。农民必须自己夺地和取得土地所有权，自己解放自己。必须在工人阶级领导下走这条路，组织农民运动。反夺佃、反放债、反增税和夺地的农民群众运动，要和一切（民主）运动以及大革命夺权斗争结合起来。这样，建立了农民革命根据地的地方，不受剥削的农民就能很快增产，解决人民和战士的粮食问题。
    《爱国者》的文章最后指出：印度的革命必须是“占领农村后包围城市”。“印度农村居住着约四亿农民，他们受的压迫和剥削最大，对敌人的仇恨最深。他们会坚决战斗，长期战斗……城市里的一切民主运动的方向和注意力都要朝着他们。”“必须记住：这个斗争将是非常艰苦的长期的流血斗争。走这条路，就能消灭敌人，否则自己就要被消灭，此外是没有永远摆脱饥荒的道路的。”
