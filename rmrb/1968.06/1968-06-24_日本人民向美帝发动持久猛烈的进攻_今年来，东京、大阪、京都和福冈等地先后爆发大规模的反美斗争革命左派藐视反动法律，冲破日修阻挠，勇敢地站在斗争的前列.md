The Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle is developing persistently and ferociously. Since the beginning of this year, struggles against the docking of U.S. nuclear warships in Sasebo, against the construction of the "New International Airport" in Narita, demanding the removal of the U.S. field hospitals in Japan, and demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. military from the Patu base have risen and fallen, forming a strong current of anti-American struggle.

On the evening of June 2, a U.S. military F-4C Phantom II fighter-bomber crashed during a drill and fell into Kyushu University in Fukuoka City, completely burning down a large building in the university. This crime by the U.S. military further incensed the people of Fukuoka, who have long suffered from the harassment and damage caused by U.S. military aircraft. They quickly launched a wave of mass struggles.

Since June 3, students, workers, and citizens of Fukuoka City have held massive protest rallies and demonstrations, protesting against the U.S. military's atrocities and demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. military from the Patu base.

The brave struggle of Fukuoka's patriotic students and people has greatly inspired the anti-American patriotic spirit of the Japanese people nationwide. Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, Nagoya, Yamaguchi, and other places where U.S. military bases are located have successively launched new large-scale protest activities, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. military bases and the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." On June 7 and June 15, two nationwide unified actions were launched, covering more than twenty prefectures. In places like Yokosuka, Yokota, Iwakuni, Tachikawa, Oji, and more than thirty other places where U.S. military bases are located, the people have launched various forms of protest struggles. Currently, this large-scale struggle to demand the withdrawal of U.S. military bases is continuing to develop in depth.

In this grand struggle to demand the withdrawal of U.S. military bases, the revolutionary leftists of Fukuoka, the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), and the revolutionary leftists and revolutionary masses of Yamaguchi, Osaka, Hyogo, Kyoto, and Tokyo have raised red flags with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" and bravely stood at the forefront of the struggle. The Fukui Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (left wing) issued a call: with the workers' strike as the center, people of all classes should take action, form a powerful united front, and launch a persistent and ferocious struggle to overthrow the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

In the struggle, Japanese patriotic students and revolutionary people have defied the so-called "laws" and "order" of the reactionary Sato government, broken through the "legalism" framework that restricts mass movements by the revisionist group led by Kyuichi Tokuda of the Japanese Communist Party, fearlessly faced the enemy's threats and suppression, and fought bravely, showing great revolutionary spirit. On June 15, in Osaka City, more than 15,000 workers, students, and citizens held a demonstration. The Japanese reactionary authorities dispatched a large number of police to disrupt and suppress the demonstration. However, the 3,000 patriotic students at the front of the march, undeterred by the reactionaries' threats and suppression, bravely fought with the armed police time and time again. Although more than 200 were injured by the police, the march continued bravely forward and finally achieved victory. The Japanese bourgeois newspaper *Asahi Shimbun* exclaimed: "The scale and intensity of this struggle by the people of Osaka are unprecedented in (Japanese) history."

As the struggle develops, not only is the number of patriotic students growing, but the ranks of young workers are also rapidly expanding. In many cities, these two forces have begun to combine. Many struggles have been jointly carried out by patriotic students and young workers.

Great Leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "In recent years, the anti-American imperialist invasion, oppression, and control of the Japanese people of all classes have continuously expanded. This is the most reliable guarantee for the victory of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle." The people of all classes in Japan have formed a vast army in the struggle, directing their struggle against American imperialism, against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and against U.S. military bases, dealing a heavy blow to American imperialism and its running dog, the Japanese reactionaries.

    日本人民向美帝发动持久猛烈的进攻
    今年来，东京、大阪、京都和福冈等地先后爆发大规模的反美斗争革命左派藐视反动法律，冲破日修阻挠，勇敢地站在斗争的前列
    据新华社东京二十一日电　日本人民反美爱国斗争正在持久而猛烈地向前发展。今年年初以来反对美国核舰艇进驻佐世保、反对修建成田“新国际机场”、要求撤除美军设在日本的野战医院和要求美军撤除板付基地的斗争，此伏彼起，汇成了一股强烈的反美斗争巨流。
    六月二日晚，一架美军F—4C型鬼怪式战斗轰炸机在演习中坠落在福冈市九州大学内，完全焚毁了这个大学的一座大楼。美军的这一罪行，进一步激起了深受美国强盗飞机骚扰、侵害的福冈人民的强烈愤怒。他们迅速地掀起了广泛的群众斗争的浪潮。
    从三日以来，福冈市的学生、工人和市民连日举行声势浩大的抗议集会和示威游行，抗议美军的暴行和要求撤除板付基地。
    福冈市的爱国学生和人民的英勇斗争，大大地鼓舞了日本全国人民反美爱国的斗志。东京、大阪、京都、神户、名古屋、山口和美军基地所在各地，陆续展开了新的大规模抗议活动，要求撤除美军基地和废除日美“安全条约”。六月七日和六月十五日连续爆发了两次全国规模的统一行动，其范围遍及二十几个都、道、府和县。在美军基地所在地横须贺、横田、岩国、立川、王子等三十几个地方的人民群众，展开了各种形式的抗议斗争。目前，这一规模壮大的要求撤除美军基地的斗争浪潮正在继续向纵深发展。
    在这次波澜壮阔的要求美军撤除军事基地的斗争中，福冈革命左派、福冈日中友好协会（正统）总部的活动家和山口、大阪、兵库、京都、东京的革命左派和革命群众，高举写着“毛泽东思想万岁！”的红旗，勇敢地站在斗争的前列。日共福冈县委员会（左派）发出号召：以工人阶级的罢工为中心，各阶层广大人民行动起来，结成强大的统一战线，为打倒美日反动派展开持久的、猛烈的斗争。
    在斗争中，日本爱国学生和革命人民，藐视佐藤反动政府的所谓“法律”和“秩序”，打破了日共宫本修正主义集团限制群众运动的“合法主义”框框，不怕敌人的恫吓和镇压，英勇斗争，表现了大无畏的革命气概。六月十五日，在大阪市，一万五千多名工人、学生和市民举行示威游行。日本反动当局出动了大批警察进行破坏和镇压。但是走在游行队伍前面的三千名爱国学生，不顾反动派的恫吓和镇压，奋不顾身地和武装警察进行了一次又一次的英勇搏斗，虽然有二百多名被警察打伤，但是游行队伍继续奋勇地前进，最后终于取得了胜利。日本资产阶级报纸《朝日新闻》惊呼：大阪人民的这场斗争，“其规模和激烈程度是（日本）历史上从来没有过的。”
    随着斗争的发展，不仅爱国学生的队伍不断扩大，青年工人的斗争行列也在迅速地壮大。在很多城市里这两支队伍已经开始结合起来。许多次斗争都是爱国学生和青年工人统一举行的。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“这些年来，日本各阶层人民反对美帝国主义侵略、压迫和控制的爱国统一战线不断地扩大。这是日本人民反美爱国斗争胜利的最可靠的保证。”日本各阶层人民在斗争中组成了浩浩荡荡的大军，把斗争矛头指向美帝国主义，指向日美“安全条约”，指向美国军事基地，沉重地打击了美帝国主义及其走狗日本反动派。
