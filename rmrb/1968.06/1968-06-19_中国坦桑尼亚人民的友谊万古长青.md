The friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania is everlasting. Although China and Tanzania are separated by vast distances, the peoples of the two countries have always cooperated and supported each other in their struggles against imperialism and in building their respective nations. The Chinese people regard the Tanzanian people as their friends, and the Tanzanian people often say, "The Chinese people are our brothers!"

Recently, a group of Chinese technical workers who had been helping the Tanzanian people with their construction returned to China. They brought back with them the friendship of the Tanzanian people for the Chinese people and the Tanzanian people's deep respect for our great leader Chairman Mao.

During their stay in Tanzania, the Chinese technical workers, whether in cities or rural areas, on construction sites or in their residences, always lived in an atmosphere of friendship. The Tanzanian people's love for our great leader Chairman Mao, in particular, deeply moved the Chinese technical workers. On October 1, 1967, the Chinese National Day, Chinese technical workers working at a school construction site in Tanzania held a reception. At this friendly gathering, many Tanzanian friends cheered for the great achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao and were delighted that Chairman Mao had sent technical workers to help them develop their national economy. A responsible person from the school said, "China not only provides us with economic aid but also brings us Chairman Mao Zedong's ideology of self-reliance in construction. The hard work, bravery, and selflessness of the Chinese technical workers are examples for us to learn from." During the cordial conversation, some Tanzanian workers, holding the hands of the Chinese technical workers, repeatedly said, "We thank Chairman Mao! Thank Chairman Mao!" Some workers shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

An elderly worker who had been working at the school had a son who had studied in China and had personally witnessed the great achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao. This elderly worker, deeply moved, told the Chinese technical workers, "Chairman Mao is truly great! He has led the Chinese people to build so well. I will definitely educate my son to study Chairman Mao's works and serve the Tanzanian people."

When the Chinese Arts and Crafts Exhibition was held in Dar es Salaam, tens of thousands of Tanzanian friends came to see it, many of whom traveled from far away. As soon as the visitors entered the exhibition hall, they paid their respects to the portrait of Chairman Mao in the center of the hall. Some even brought their entire families to take photos in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, saying happily, "Taking a photo in front of Chairman Mao's portrait is our honor."

The Chinese technical workers who have returned to the country introduced that during their more than two years of work in Tanzania, they always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and took Dr. Norman Bethune, the internationalist warrior, as their example. They lived and worked with the Tanzanian people every day, establishing close friendly relations. During these days, they all personally felt the warm care of the Tanzanian people. On construction sites and farms where Chinese technical workers were working, the Tanzanian government and people provided good conditions, enabling them to complete their tasks smoothly. The Tanzanian people highly appreciated the work of the Chinese technical workers, giving great encouragement to the Chinese friends, affectionately calling them "good workers sent by Chairman Mao" and "Chinese brothers." In terms of living conditions, the Tanzanian people also took good care of them. People still remember that once, when a Chinese technical worker was unfortunately injured at work, the Tanzanian government immediately sent a famous doctor to treat him. During the hospital stay of the injured Chinese technical worker, the doctors and nurses in the hospital, as well as many local Tanzanian friends, visited the ward every day to inquire about his health, praising the selfless work spirit of the Chinese friends, and wishing him a speedy recovery.

During their stay in Tanzania, the Chinese technical workers personally saw the brave spirit of the Tanzanian people in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism, in defending national independence under the leadership of President Nyerere, and saw the achievements of the Tanzanian people in developing their national economy with self-reliance. The Chinese technical workers were happy about all this and were inspired by it, wholeheartedly contributing their strength to the construction cause of the Tanzanian people.

Recently, the term of work for this group of Chinese technical workers was completed, and they were about to return to the country. On the day of their farewell in Dar es Salaam, many Tanzanian friends warmly sent them off. Some Tanzanian friends tightly held the hands of the Chinese technical workers, repeatedly expressing their love for Chairman Mao and wishing for the everlasting friendship between the peoples of Tanzania and China. A worker named Francis was very excited and said, "After you return to the country, please remember to convey our greetings to Chairman Mao!" This worker also asked the Chinese technical workers to deliver a letter to Chairman Mao. In the letter, he wrote enthusiastically:

"Respected Chairman, Great Helmsman:

We, the children and youth of Tanzania, cheer and thank you for sending us hardworking and brave people. The people of Tanzania are determined to stand with the people of China and resolutely fight against imperialism and reactionaries.

Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!"

    中国坦桑尼亚人民的友谊万古长青
    中国和非洲的坦桑尼亚，远隔万水千山，但是中国和坦桑尼亚两国人民，在反对帝国主义和建设各自国家的斗争中，却始终是相互合作、相互支持的。中国人民把坦桑尼亚人民看做是自己的朋友，坦桑尼亚人民也常说：“中国人民是我们的弟兄！”
    不久前，一批帮助坦桑尼亚人民建设的中国技术工作人员回国了。他们从遥远的非洲带回了坦桑尼亚人民对中国人民的友谊，带回了坦桑尼亚人民对我们伟大领袖毛主席的崇高敬意。
    中国技术工作人员在坦桑尼亚期间，无论在城市还是在农村，无论在建设工地还是在他们的住所，时时刻刻都生活在友好的气氛当中。坦桑尼亚人民对我们伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，尤其使中国技术工作人员深深受到感动。一九六七年十月一日我国国庆节那天，在坦桑尼亚一所学校建筑工地工作的中国技术工作人员，举行了一个招待会。在这个充满友好气氛的招待会上，许多坦桑尼亚朋友都为中国人民在毛主席领导下所取得的伟大成就而欢呼，为毛主席派来技术工作人员帮助他们发展民族经济而高兴。这个学校的一位负责人说，中国不但给我们经济援助，而且给我们带来了毛泽东主席自力更生进行建设的思想。中国技术工作人员那样勤劳、勇敢和忘我劳动，这种精神是我们学习的榜样。宾主在亲切的交谈中，有的坦桑尼亚工人握着中国技术工作人员的手连连说：“我们感谢毛主席！感谢毛主席！”有的工人高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    在这个学校工作的一位老工人，他的儿子曾经在中国学习过，亲眼看见过中国人民在毛主席领导下取得的伟大成就。这位老工人非常激动地对中国技术工作人员说，毛主席真伟大啊！他领导中国人民建设得那样好。我一定教育我的儿子要好好学习毛主席的书，为坦桑尼亚人民服务。
    中国工艺美术展览在达累斯萨拉姆展出的时候，成千上万的坦桑尼亚朋友看了展览，其中许多人是从很远的地方赶来的。许多观众一进展览厅，就面向大厅中的毛主席像致敬，有的还带着全家老少，在毛主席像前合影留念，他们高兴地说，我们在毛主席像前照相，这是我们的光荣。
    已经回国的中国技术工作人员介绍说，他们在坦桑尼亚工作的两年多的时间里，牢记毛主席的教导，以国际主义战士白求恩为榜样，每天同坦桑尼亚人民生活在一起，劳动在一起，建立了密切的友好关系。在这些日子里，他们每一个人都亲身感受到坦桑尼亚人民给予他们的热情关怀。在有中国技术工作人员工作的工地上和农场里，坦桑尼亚政府和人民提供了良好的条件，使他们能够顺利地完成任务。坦桑尼亚人民高度评价中国技术工作人员的工作，给中国朋友极大的鼓励，亲切地称他们是“毛主席派来的好工人”，“中国弟兄”。在生活上，坦桑尼亚人民也给予周到的照顾。人们还记得：有一次，当一个中国技术工作人员在工作中不幸受伤的时候，坦桑尼亚政府立即派出了有名的医生给他医疗。受伤的中国技术工作人员在住院期间，医院里的医生和护士，以及当地许多坦桑尼亚朋友每天都到病房里问寒问暖，称赞中国朋友忘我的工作精神，并且祝愿他早日恢复健康。
    中国技术工作人员在坦桑尼亚期间，亲眼看到了坦桑尼亚人民在尼雷尔总统领导下，在反帝反殖、维护民族独立的斗争中所表现出来的勇敢精神，看到了坦桑尼亚人民以自力更生的精神在发展民族经济中所取得的成就。中国技术工作人员为这一切而感到高兴，并从中受到鼓舞，全心全意地为坦桑尼亚人民的建设事业贡献自己的力量。
    不久前，这批中国技术工作人员工作期满就要回国了。在告别达累斯萨拉姆的那天，许多坦桑尼亚朋友热烈欢送他们。有的坦桑尼亚朋友紧紧握住中国技术工作人员的手，一次又一次地向中国技术工作人员表达他们对毛主席的热爱，祝坦桑尼亚和中国两国人民的友谊万古长青。一位名叫福兰西的工人非常激动地说：“你们回国以后，千万记着代我们向毛主席问好！”这位工人还请中国技术工作人员把一封信转交给毛主席。他在信中热情地写道：
    “尊敬的主席、伟大的舵手：
    我们坦桑尼亚的儿童和青年，欢呼和感谢您为我们派来了勤劳勇敢的人。我们坦桑尼亚人民决心和中国人民在一起，坚决同帝国主义和反动派作斗争。
    毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
