The fascist military regime of Suharto and Nasution in Indonesia, beset by internal and external difficulties, is accelerating the operation of its printing presses, issuing more paper currency, and further plundering the people's wealth.

According to reports, the finance minister of the Indonesian fascist military regime recently admitted that the amount of currency currently in circulation in Indonesia has reached 600 billion rupiahs (Indonesian currency), double the 200 billion rupiahs in circulation at the end of 1966.

Due to the reactionary regime's issuance of more paper currency and intensified exploitation of the people, Indonesian printing plants are rushing to print more banknotes. According to the Indonesian newspaper "The Torch of the Poor," the state-owned printing plant in Kebayoran is printing banknotes day and night, but still cannot meet the demand. Now it is feeling "overburdened," and often the banknotes are sent to the supply departments as soon as they are printed, with the ink still wet.

Selling National Interests to Attract Foreign Capital

The Indonesian fascist military regime is willing to sell national interests to attract a large amount of foreign capital. The Indonesian newspaper "Light of Hope" recently reported that according to statistics from the tax bureau of this reactionary regime at the end of last year, a total of 68 foreign companies have already obtained or are about to obtain permits to operate in Indonesia, of which 43 have proposed an investment of 401 million 440 thousand 500 US dollars.

With the influx of foreign capital, Indonesian national industries are being squeezed out and are on the verge of bankruptcy. Currently, 75% of factories have closed. The leather industry in Bandung and its surrounding areas has 85% of its operations paralyzed, with some leather factories already closed. The textile industry in cities like Cirebon, North Kalimantan, and Surakarta has also stopped production, with only 10% to 15% of factories still operating.

Oil Price Hikes Lead to Soaring Prices

To remedy the ailing Indonesian economy, Suharto recently announced in a "presidential decision" to raise the prices of oil products, increasing the price of gasoline from 4 rupiahs per liter to 16 rupiahs, and kerosene from 2 rupiahs per liter to 4 rupiahs. The prices of lubricating oil and diesel oil were also raised.

When announcing this decision, Suharto admitted that it was "unpopular" but also hypocritically claimed it was the "least harmful to the people's interests."

This method of "squeezing oil from oil" has further worsened the Indonesian economy, leading to soaring prices. According to Indonesian newspapers, after the oil price hike, bus fares doubled, domestic postal rates doubled, railway passenger fares doubled, and electricity costs increased by an average of 133%. The price of rice per liter rose from 50 rupiahs to 60 rupiahs, vegetables increased by 29%, and fish per kilogram rose from 75 rupiahs to 90 rupiahs.

People Suffering, Public Anger Boiling

According to the Associated Press, based on the current average salary of Indonesian civil servants, "if he is single and takes the bus to work, he can only last less than two weeks." Some people's income "can only buy two suitable shirts, but they have no food to eat for the rest of the month."

On one hand, prices are soaring, and on the other hand, factories are closing, and a large number of workers are being laid off, pushing the Indonesian people into the depths of suffering. According to Agence France-Presse, Indonesia currently has about 14 million unemployed people. The Indonesian people, struggling on the brink of death, are increasingly dissatisfied with the status quo. Even Indonesian reactionary publications have to admit: "All the common people are complaining and feeling anxious."

    反动派倒行逆施  印尼经济一团糟
    滥发纸币搜刮民脂民膏
    处于内外交困的印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，加紧开动钞票印刷机，滥发纸币，进一步搜刮民脂民膏。
    据报道，印尼法西斯军人政权财政部长最近供认，目前印尼市面流通的货币已达六百亿盾（印尼币），比一九六六年年底的通货二百亿盾，增加了两倍。
    由于印尼反动政权滥发纸币，加紧剥削人民，印尼的印刷厂正在赶印钞票。据印尼《贫民火炬报》报道，印尼克巴约兰国营印刷厂日夜不停地印刷钞票，但仍然供不应求，现在已深感“负担过重”，甚至经常出现这样的情况：钞票刚印出来，油墨还没有干，就拿到供应部门去使用了。
    引进外资出卖民族利益
    印尼法西斯军人政权不惜出卖民族利益，引进大量外国资本。印尼《希望之光报》最近报道，据这个反动政权的税务司去年年底的统计材料，总共有六十八家外国企业已经和将要获得许可在印尼营业，其中有四十三家已经提出四亿零一百四十四万零五百美元的投资额。
    随着外资的侵入，印尼民族工业受尽排挤，濒于破产。目前已有百分之七十五的工厂倒闭。万隆及其周围地区的皮革工业，已有百分之八十五陷于瘫痪状态，有的皮革工厂已倒闭。直葛、北加浪岸、梭罗等地区的纺织工业也陷于生产停顿状态，还在生产的工厂只有百分之十到十五。
    石油提价引起百物飞涨
    为了补救千疮百孔的印尼经济，苏哈托在不久前的一项“总统决定”中宣布提高石油产品价格，把汽油价格由每公升四盾提高到十六盾，煤油价格由每公升两盾提高到四盾。润滑油、柴油的价格也同时提高。
    苏哈托在宣布这项决定时，一面供认这项决定“不得民心”；一面又假惺惺地说这是“最不损害人民的利益的做法”。
    这种油中榨“油”的做法导致了印尼经济的进一步恶化，引起百物飞涨。据印尼报纸报道，石油涨价之后，公共汽车车费随之涨了一倍，国内邮费涨了两倍，铁路客运费涨了两倍，用电费用平均涨了百分之一百三十三。大米每公升从五十盾上升到六十盾，蔬菜涨价百分之二十九，鱼每公斤从七十五盾上升到九十盾。
    民不聊生民怨沸腾
    据美联社报道，按目前印尼公务员的平均工资计算，“如果他是个单身汉而乘车去上班的话，只能维持不到两个星期”。有的人的工资收入“只能用来买两件合适的衬衫，但当月就没饭吃”。
    一面是物价飞涨，一面是工厂倒闭，大批工人被解雇，印尼人民被推入了苦难的深渊。据法新社报道，印尼目前失业人数约有一千四百万人。在死亡线上挣扎的印尼人民越来越不满现状，连印尼反动报刊也不得不供认：“所有的老百姓都发怨言并感到忧虑”。
