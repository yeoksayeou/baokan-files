The revolutionary workers on the textile front in Tianjin, with the help of the PLA's leftist cadres, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They are resolutely implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's directive to "ensure that cloth production is tightened up." By using class struggle to drive production struggle, the entire textile industry system is experiencing a great revolutionary and production situation that is getting better and better.

Since this year, the total industrial output value of the textile industry system in the entire city has been increasing month by month. The production of cotton cloth, cotton yarn, printing and dyeing, woolen fabrics, and knitted products has increased significantly, and the quality has been continuously improving. The variety of colors and types has also been increasing. Among them, the production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in May increased by more than 24% compared to April.

The revolutionary committees and revolutionary factions at various levels in the Tianjin textile industry system have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle." They have mobilized the masses to strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, unite all revolutionary forces that can be united, and launch a fierce attack on the class enemies. They have exposed and criticized the crimes of a handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hidden within the factories and enterprises, and have implemented proletarian dictatorship over them, smashing their various plots to sabotage the revolution and production. This has mobilized the production enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers. The revolutionary workers of the Second Cotton Textile Mill in Tianjin, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have analyzed the new situation and trends of class struggle, sharpened their eyes, and exposed a handful of class enemies. The revolutionary and production situation is excellent. After completing the production plan in April, the cotton cloth production in May increased by 13.5% compared to April.

Under the help of the PLA's leftist cadres, the broad revolutionary workers have carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, eliminating the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the textile industry system in Tianjin. In the process of carrying out the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary workers have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and have worked hard on production with a hundredfold revolutionary enthusiasm. Many factory revolutionary workers have used revolutionary criticism as a weapon to break through old frameworks and foreign dogmas, and have carried out mass technical innovation activities. The revolutionary workers of the Fourth and Fourteenth Dyeing Mills in Tianjin have relied on their own strength, worked hard, and created innovative projects such as sizing and dividing yarn devices, significantly improving production efficiency.

The revolutionary committees at various levels in the Tianjin textile industry system have followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline and downsize, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." They have reduced the number of organizational levels and implemented streamlining and downsizing. The members of the revolutionary committees at various levels and the broad revolutionary cadres have gone deep into the workshops and teams, working, studying, and carrying out revolutionary criticism with the workers. They have grasped the revolution and promoted production. One hundred forty office cadres from the Tianjin Hemp Mill have mostly been sent to the production front line. The fourteen members of the mill's revolutionary committee, except for those who stay to handle daily work, have all gone to the workshops and teams to participate in production labor, promoting the development of the revolution and production. After completing the annual production plan last year, this mill has been completing the production plan month by month since this year.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗　以阶级斗争带动生产斗争
    天津纺织工业战线取得优异成绩
    广大革命职工坚决贯彻执行毛主席“必须把布匹抓紧”的指示，全市纺织工业总产值月月上升，产品产量大幅度增长，质量不断提高
    据新华社天津十三日电　天津市纺织工业战线革命职工，在解放军支左人员的帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“必须把布匹抓紧”的指示，以阶级斗争带动生产斗争，整个纺织工业系统革命和生产形势一片大好，越来越好。
    今年以来，全市纺织工业系统的总产值月月增长。棉布、棉纱、印染、呢绒和针织品等产品的产量大幅度上升，质量不断提高，花色品种不断增加。其中，棉纱、棉布的产量，五月份比四月份提高百分之二十四以上。
    天津市纺织工业系统各级革命委员会和无产阶级革命派，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，放手发动群众，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，主动地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，挖出了隐藏在工厂企业内部的一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子，揭发和批判他们的罪行，对他们实行无产阶级专政，粉碎了他们妄图破坏革命和生产的种种阴谋诡计，调动了广大革命职工的生产积极性。天津第二棉纺织厂的广大革命职工用毛泽东思想武装起来，分析阶级斗争的新形势、新动向，擦亮眼睛，揪出了一小撮阶级敌人，革命和生产形势大好。这个厂四月份完成生产计划之后，五月份的棉布产量又比四月份增加百分之十三点五。
    广大革命职工在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，深入持久地开展革命大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在天津的代理人在纺织工业系统中散布的反革命修正主义流毒。广大革命职工在开展革命大批判过程中，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，以百倍的革命干劲搞好生产。许多工厂的革命职工以革命大批判为武器，打破旧框框、洋教条，开展了群众性的技术革新活动。天津市色织四厂、色织十四厂的革命职工，自力更生，奋发图强，创造了浆纱分纱装置等革新项目，显著地提高了生产效率。
    天津市纺织工业系统各级革命委员会，遵照毛主席关于“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的教导，减少机构层次，实行精兵简政。各级革委会成员和广大革命干部深入到车间、班组，同工人一起劳动，一起学习，一起开展革命大批判，狠抓革命，猛促生产。天津麻纺厂的一百四十名科室干部，大多数已充实到生产第一线去。厂革委会十四名委员，除留下值班人员处理日常工作以外，全部到车间、班组参加生产劳动，推动了革命和生产的发展。这个厂去年完成全年生产计划之后，今年以来又月月完成生产计划。
