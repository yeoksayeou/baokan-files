The sun and rain nurture the pine tree, and heroes emerge in the era of Mao Zedong. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary people in Xipu Brigade of Jianming Commune, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, have repeatedly and seriously studied the heroic deeds of Comrade Men He, who is "a good cadre who is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." We are proud that Chairman Mao has such a steadfast warrior and that the poor and lower-middle peasants have such an outstanding offspring. We once again express our determination: learn from Comrade Men He, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death. We shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

Comrade Men He once made a heroic vow: "Always stand guard, keep watch, and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." He said it and did it. Learning from Men He and thinking of Xipu, we feel even more affectionate towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Whether one stands on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the fundamental criterion to judge whether a person is a true revolutionary or a false revolutionary, a counter-revolutionary; it is a major issue of whether the Chinese revolution will achieve thorough victory and ultimately realize communism, or take a step backward and restore capitalism. In the struggles between the two lines since the founding of the nation, Comrade Men He has always stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and fought fearlessly against the class enemy. Why? It is for the thorough victory of the proletarian revolutionary cause and for the realization of the grand ideal of communism.

Looking back at our Xipu Brigade, from the land reform in 1947 to this proletarian cultural revolution, every step of the revolutionary movement has gone through fierce struggles between the two lines. Especially after the agricultural cooperativization, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we, with the 23 households of poor peasants as the backbone, united the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary people, and fought resolutely against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. We achieved victory after victory. In this proletarian cultural revolution, the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Xipu colluded with a small handful of counter-revolutionaries and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to spread poisonous winds and set off ghost fires, actively executing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, attempting to cut down the red flag of the "bare-stick" commune personally raised by Chairman Mao and trying to restore capitalism in Xipu. At this critical moment of struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, the poor and lower-middle peasants united with the broad revolutionary masses and fought resolutely against the class enemy time and time again, bravely defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and achieving great victory in the cultural revolution. After learning from Comrade Men He's heroic deeds, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt: "Above all, defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the most important. Without Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, it means leaving socialism, and we poor and lower-middle peasants will lose our heads." Everyone expressed that they would defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line like Comrade Men He, even if it means climbing mountains of knives or crossing seas of fire.

To carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, one must have the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly and must stay close to the masses. Comrade Men He raised the importance of staying close to the masses to the level of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Wherever he went, he united with the local masses and always remained a soldier of the revolution. I am also from a poor peasant family, and labor is my duty. However, in recent years, I always thought that work was busy and there were many things to do, so I had less contact with the masses and participated less in collective labor. Compared to Comrade Men He, the gap is huge. Chairman Mao teaches us that cadres must honestly be "servants of the people" and respectfully be "students of the masses." Comparing with Chairman Mao's teachings and Comrade Men He's deeds, our brigade's leading cadre seriously carried out criticism and self-criticism. Everyone deeply realized that to honestly be "servants of the people," the most important thing is: listen to Chairman Mao's words, not a single bit can be different; stay with the masses, not a single moment can be separated. Chairman Mao's words are the truth of revolution. If we lose the truth, what else can we rely on for revolution? The people are the masters of society. If we separate from the masters, for whom will this "servant" serve? Everyone raised their awareness, made plans, and immediately implemented them. No matter how busy or how many things there are, they must work with the community members, humbly learn from the masses, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, firmly rooting themselves among the masses and always staying with the people.

We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary people, and revolutionary cadres of Xipu Brigade, are determined, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to take Comrade Men He as an example, continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the "bare-stick" commune, and in the struggle between the two lines, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We will resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism, resolutely repel the rightist reversal wind, resolutely criticize and expose the small handful of class enemies like the Chinese Khrushchev, and thoroughly eliminate their poison, defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death.

    为捍卫毛主席的革命路线永远战斗
    王国藩
    阳光雨露育青松，毛泽东时代出英雄。我们建明公社西铺大队广大贫下中农和革命群众，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，反复认真地学习了“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志的英雄事迹。我们为毛主席他老人家有这样坚强的战士、为贫下中农有这样的优秀子弟而自豪。我们一次再次表示决心：向门合同志学习，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线。我们千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    门合同志曾经发出豪迈的誓言：“时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗”。他是这样说的，也是这样做的。学门合，想西铺，我们对毛主席的革命路线就感到更加亲切。是不是站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，这是衡量一个人是真革命，还是假革命、反革命的根本标志；是中国革命取得彻底胜利、最终实现共产主义，还是走回头路、复辟资本主义的大事情。门合同志在建国以来两条路线的历次斗争中，都是坚定不移地站在毛主席革命路线一边，同阶级敌人进行英勇无畏的斗争。他是为了什么？就是为了取得无产阶级革命事业的彻底胜利，为了实现远大的共产主义理想。
    回顾我们西铺大队，从一九四七年土地改革以来，一直到这次无产阶级文化大革命，革命运动每发展一步，都要经过两条路线的激烈斗争。特别是农业合作化以后，在伟大领袖毛主席的革命路线的指引下，我们以坚持办社的二十三户贫农为骨干，团结广大贫下中农和革命群众，向中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线进行坚决斗争，取得一次又一次的胜利。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫在西铺的代理人勾结一小撮反革命分子和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，刮阴风，点鬼火，积极执行资产阶级反动路线，妄图砍掉毛主席亲自树立的“穷棒子”社这面红旗，企图在西铺复辟资本主义。在两个阶级、两条路线、两条道路斗争非常激烈的关头，贫下中农团结广大革命群众，一次又一次地向阶级敌人作了坚决的斗争，勇敢地捍卫毛主席的革命路线，使文化大革命取得了伟大的胜利。广大贫下中农学习了门合同志的英雄事迹后，深有感触地说：“千重要，万重要，捍卫毛主席的革命路线最重要。离开了毛主席的革命路线，就是离开社会主义，我们贫下中农就要掉脑袋。”大家表示，要象门合同志那样，为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，刀山也要上，火海也要闯。
    要贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，就要有全心全意为人民服务的精神，就要密切联系群众。门合同志把密切联系群众提到忠于毛主席革命路线的高度来认识。他走到哪里，就和哪里的群众结合在一起，永远做革命的一兵一卒。我也是贫农出身，劳动是我的本份。可是近几年来，总以为工作忙，事情多，就和群众联系少了，参加集体劳动也少了。这与门合同志相比，差距很大。毛主席教导我们，当干部的，要老老实实做“人民的勤务员”，恭恭敬敬做“群众的小学生”。对照毛主席的教导，对照门合同志的事迹，我们大队领导班子，认真地开展了批评和自我批评。大家深刻地认识到，要老老实实做“人民的勤务员”，最重要的是：听毛主席的话，一丝一毫不能差；跟群众在一起，一时一刻不能离。毛主席的话，是革命的真理，丢掉了真理，还凭什么革命？人民群众是社会的主人。脱离了主人，我们这个“勤务员”还给谁服务呢？大家提高了觉悟，制订了计划，并立即落实，不管工作再忙再多，都要同社员一起参加体力劳动，虚心向群众学习，向群众宣传毛泽东思想，把根子牢牢地扎在群众当中，永远和人民群众在一起。
    我们西铺大队的贫下中农、革命群众和革命干部，决心在毛泽东思想的指引下，以门合同志为榜样，继续发扬“穷棒子”的革命精神，在两条路线的斗争中，坚定不移地站在毛主席革命路线一边，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，坚决击退右倾翻案妖风，坚决把中国赫鲁晓夫这一小撮阶级敌人批深批透，斗倒斗臭，彻底肃清他们散布的流毒，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线。
