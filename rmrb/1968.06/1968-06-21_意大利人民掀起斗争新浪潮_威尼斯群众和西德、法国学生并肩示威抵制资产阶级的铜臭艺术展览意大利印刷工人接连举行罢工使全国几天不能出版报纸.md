	The people of Italy have launched a new wave of struggle. The masses of Venice, along with students from West Germany and France, have taken to the streets to protest against the bourgeoisie's money-stained art exhibition. Italian printing workers have also held successive strikes, causing newspapers to be unable to publish nationwide for several days.

	New China News Agency, June 20th: Rome - As French workers and students bravely persist in their struggle despite numerous difficulties, progressive students, workers, and artists in Italy have also launched a new wave of struggle. In recent days, the revolutionary masses of the famous Italian city of Venice have, despite the brutal suppression by the reactionary authorities, repeatedly held meetings and large-scale demonstrations to oppose the decadent capitalist system. Students from various parts of Italy, as well as large numbers of students from West Germany and France, have flocked to Venice to support the local people's just struggle.

	On the evening of the 17th, students, workers, and artists in Venice held a mass meeting in the Academy of Fine Arts, which had been occupied by students for three months, deciding to take collective action to boycott the upcoming International Art Exhibition in Venice. They pointed out that in capitalist society, art has degenerated into an expensive toy for the ruling class to enjoy. The biennial International Art Exhibition is merely a tool for the bourgeoisie to make profits. They condemned the government for using Venice's famous landmarks and the International Art Exhibition to attract foreign tourists, allowing big capitalists to make money.

	On the 18th, over a thousand students, workers, and artists in Venice held a three-hour demonstration in front of the exhibition hall. They then waved a large red flag, shouting slogans such as "No to money-stained art," "Police out of the exhibition," and "Down with the capitalist system," as they marched through the city center. Along the way, they distributed leaflets exposing the crimes of the capitalist system and calling on the people to unite and overthrow this decadent social system. They raised a bright red flag in St. Mark's Square.

	The Italian authorities are extremely fearful and enraged by the students' rebellious actions, fearing that the students might occupy the International Art Exhibition and other famous museums. Therefore, they hastily dispatched over 4,000 police from other cities to suppress the students. These fully armed police used gun butts and batons to brutally disperse the demonstrators and savagely beat the protesters on the 18th. The students and workers bravely fought back.

	The just struggle of the youth in Venice has gained widespread support both domestically and internationally. In recent days, large numbers of progressive students from other Italian cities have been pouring into Venice. Students from West Germany and France have also flocked to join the youth of Venice in their struggle. After holding meetings, they decided to hold another mass rally and demonstration in front of St. Mark's Square in the evening of the 19th to protest against the police brutality and condemn the decadent capitalist system. They also decided to continue taking collective action to boycott the bourgeoisie's International Art Exhibition, preventing it from opening as scheduled on the 22nd. The Italian authorities, terrified by the people's rebellious actions, hastily ordered over 4,000 police to guard all strategic points in the city, maintaining a state of "alert" day and night.

	To express their sympathy and support for the students' struggle, many Italian and foreign artists decided to withdraw their works and not participate in the Venice exhibition. One painter said, "This is not an art exhibition but a barracks. The person in charge of the exhibition is an assistant to the police."

	Some Italian art critics also issued a statement condemning the police brutality. They emphasized that the current state of the Italian art world must be fundamentally changed, freeing art from the control of government bureaucratic institutions and a small group of wealthy speculators.

	Our correspondent reports that Italian workers continue to strike, resolutely fighting against Italian monopolistic capital and the reactionary government.

	Italian printing workers nationwide began a 48-hour strike at midnight on the 13th, demanding wage increases. This strike resulted in no newspapers being published nationwide in Italy on the afternoon of the 14th, all day on the 15th, and the morning of the 16th. On the 19th, they held a second 48-hour strike and planned to strike for one more day on the 22nd. Additionally, doctors in some large hospitals in Rome also went on strike on the 17th.

    意大利人民掀起斗争新浪潮
    威尼斯群众和西德、法国学生并肩示威抵制资产阶级的铜臭艺术展览意大利印刷工人接连举行罢工使全国几天不能出版报纸
    新华社二十日讯　罗马消息：当法国的工人和学生正在排除万难，英勇顽强坚持斗争的时候，意大利的进步学生、工人和艺术工作者掀起了新的斗争怒潮。连日来，意大利著名城市威尼斯的革命群众，不顾反动当局的残暴镇压，一再举行集会和声势浩大的示威游行，反对腐朽的资本主义制度。意大利各地以及西德、法国的大批学生，纷纷赶往威尼斯，支援当地人民的正义斗争。
    威尼斯的学生、工人和艺术工作者，十七日晚上在已被学生占领了三个月的美术学院里举行了群众大会，决定采取群众性的斗争行动，抵制即将在威尼斯开幕的国际艺术展览会。他们指出，在资本主义社会中，艺术已堕落成为“统治阶级玩赏的费钱的玩意儿”，两年一度的国际艺术展览会，只是资产阶级谋利的工具。他们谴责政府利用威尼斯的名胜古迹和国际艺术展览会来吸引外国游客，让大资本家发财。
    十八日，威尼斯一千多名学生、工人和艺术工作者在展览馆前举行了三小时的示威。接着，他们挥舞着一面巨大的红旗，高呼“不要铜臭艺术”，“警察滚出展览会”，以及反对资本主义制度的口号，在市中心举行了示威游行。示威者沿途散发传单，揭露资本主义制度的罪恶，号召人民团结起来，推翻这个腐朽的社会制度。他们在圣马克广场上升起一面鲜艳的红旗。
    意大利当局对学生们的造反行动恨得要命，怕得要死。它很害怕学生们占领国际艺术展览会和其他著名的博物馆，因此慌忙从其他城市调集了四千多名警察，对学生们进行镇压。这些全副武装的警察，十八日使用了枪托和棍棒，蛮横地驱散示威的队伍，并野蛮地殴打示威者。学生和工人们英勇地进行了反击。
    威尼斯青年学生的正义斗争在国内外获得广泛的支持。意大利其他城市的大批进步学生这几天川流不息地涌进威尼斯，西德、法国的学生也纷纷赶来，同威尼斯青年并肩战斗。他们在举行会议后决定，十九日傍晚在圣马克广场前再次举行群众大会和示威游行，抗议警察的暴行，谴责腐朽的资本主义制度。他们还决定要继续采取群众斗争的行动，抵制资产阶级的国际艺术展览会，使它无法按期在二十二日开幕。被群众的造反行动吓得胆战心惊的意大利当局连忙下令四千多名警察把守全市战略据点，日夜进行“戒备”。
    为了表示同情和支持学生们的斗争，许多意大利的和外国的艺术家决定把他们的作品取走，不参加威尼斯的展览会。一个画家说：“这不是一个艺术展览会而是兵营，展览会的负责人就是警察助理。”
    意大利的一些艺术评论家也发表公报，谴责警察的暴行。他们还强调指出，必须根本改变意大利艺术界的现状，使艺术摆脱政府官僚机构和由富有的投机商组成的少数集团的控制。
    本报讯　意大利工人继续罢工，坚决同意大利垄断资本和反动政府进行斗争。
    意大利全国印刷工人，从十三日午夜开始，举行四十八小时罢工，要求增加工资。这次罢工使意大利全国十四日下午、十五日全天和十六日上午没有报纸出版。十九日，他们又举行了第二次四十八小时罢工，并且计划还要在二十二日举行一天罢工。此外，罗马的一些大医院的医生也在十七日举行了罢工。
