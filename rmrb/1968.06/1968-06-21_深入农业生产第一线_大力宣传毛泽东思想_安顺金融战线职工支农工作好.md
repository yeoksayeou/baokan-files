The revolutionary cadres of the financial sector in Anshun, Guizhou, have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." Carrying Chairman Mao's revolutionary works, they have gone deep into the front lines of agricultural production, vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought. Based on thorough investigations and research, they have issued agricultural loans and advance purchase deposits, timely helping production teams solve problems in current production. By the beginning of May, the entire region had issued 33.2 million yuan in agricultural loans and advance purchase deposits. According to statistics from Anshun, Zhenning, Langdai, and Xiuwen counties, 1,053 production teams have used loans to purchase 1,484 draft animals, as well as a large number of water pumps, diesel pumps, waterwheels, plows, harrows, fertilizers, and other production materials, effectively promoting agricultural production.

Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees, the revolutionary cadres of the Anshun region's banks have, through self-criticism and the repeated study of the "Three Articles," unanimously recognized that strictly and actively implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," deeply entering the front lines of agricultural production to do a good job in supporting agriculture, and timely issuing agricultural loans is actively serving the people and is a manifestation of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Based on this heightened awareness, the revolutionary cadres of various units have severely criticized the revisionist goods spread by the capitalist roaders within the banking system, such as "lend to the rich, not to the poor," and have exposed traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who sabotage agricultural support work, effectively promoting the banking sector's support for agriculture.

After entering the front lines of agricultural production, the revolutionary cadres of the banking departments in various counties across the region, following Chairman Mao's great instruction to "hold study classes, which is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," organized 35 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They went deep into the communes and brigades, helping production teams hold study classes, promoting Mao Zedong Thought, and jointly studying and solving funding issues needed for agricultural production.

    安顺金融战线职工支农工作好
    据新华社贵阳二十日电　贵州安顺地区金融战线上的广大革命职工，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，携带毛主席的革命宝书，深入农业第一线，大力宣传毛泽东思想，在做好调查研究的基础上发放支农资金，及时帮助生产队解决了当前生产中需要解决的问题。到五月上旬止，全区已发放农贷款、预购定金三百三十二万元。仅据安顺、镇宁、郎岱、修文等四县统计，已有一千零五十三个生产队用贷款购买了耕牛一千四百八十四头，以及大批抽水机、汽油泵、水车、犁耙、化肥等生产资料，有力地促进了农业生产。
    安顺地区银行广大革命职工在革命委员会领导下，通过斗私批修和反复学习“老三篇”，一致认识到，不折不扣地积极贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针，深入农业第一线做好支农工作，不失时机地发放好支农资金，就是积极为人民服务，就是忠于毛主席的表现。在提高认识的基础上，各单位革命职工狠批了过去银行系统走资派散布的“发富不发贫”等修正主义黑货，并且揪出了破坏支农工作的叛徒、特务和反革命分子，有力地推动了银行部门的支农工作。
    全地区各县银行部门革命职工深入农业第一线后，遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的伟大教导，组织了三十五个毛泽东思想宣传组，深入到社队，帮助生产队大办学习班，宣传毛泽东思想，共同研究和解决农业生产上需要的资金问题。
