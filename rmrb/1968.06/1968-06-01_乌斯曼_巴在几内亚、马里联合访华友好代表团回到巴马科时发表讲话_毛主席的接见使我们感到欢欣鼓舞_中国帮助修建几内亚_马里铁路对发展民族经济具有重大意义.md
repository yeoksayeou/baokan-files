A delegation led by Mali's Minister of Foreign Affairs, U Thaman Ba, and Guinea's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lansana Beavogui, returned to Bamako by plane on the afternoon of the 28th after visiting China.

Those who went to the airport to welcome the delegation included: members of the Malian National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, Minister of Justice and Labor Mamadou Madeira Keita, Minister of Information and Tourism Mamadou Gologo, and Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Bilama Traore. The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Mali, Liu Helin, also went to the airport to welcome the delegation.

After a brief stop, Beavogui and the Guinean delegation members returned to Guinea.

U Thaman Ba spoke at the Bamako airport. He said, "The Guinea-Mali Joint Friendship Delegation to China has returned with a very satisfied heart after completing its mission in the great, beautiful, and extremely revolutionary friendly country of the People's Republic of China. We indeed returned with full hands: on the one hand, we were filled with fervent fighting friendship and a comprehensive and profound atmosphere of mutual understanding, and on the other hand, we had very heated and frank discussions on technical cooperation issues—the purpose of our visit—as well as African and international issues. We only want to confirm what you already know through the newspapers, that is, the People's Republic of China will help build the Guinea-Mali Railway." He said, "This railway connection is a matter that has been of concern to our two countries since independence, and it has decisive importance for the process of building our independent national economies. This will be a bond that ties Mali and Guinea together."

U Thaman Ba said, "Mali is a landlocked country, but with the support of the brotherly people of Guinea, it will fundamentally solve Mali's geographical disadvantages, thus foiling the malicious schemes of those unrepentant political geographers who have long been scheming over the situation of this landlocked country of Mali."

U Thaman Ba emphasized that in Beijing, "what made us most elated was that the great leader of the Chinese people, the outstanding guide of the world revolution, Chairman Mao Zedong, received the entire delegation of Guinea and Mali. This was indeed a moving moment: Chairman Mao is in very good health, he is a revolutionary leader who is so approachable, humble, and his genius and foresight in dialectically analyzing issues related to the revolution, his boundless confidence in his people and in the victory of socialism, all this makes us always deeply admire him."

In his speech, he also talked about the deep impression left by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

U Thaman Ba said, "The Guinea-Mali Joint Friendship Delegation to China is more convinced than ever that the People's Republic of China is firmly holding high the banner of struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. The delegation is also convinced that the People's Republic of China's determination to fulfill its internationalist duties to the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America and to the struggle for liberation is greater than ever. This is pure proletarian internationalism."

U Thaman Ba concluded, "May the cooperation and unity between China, Guinea, and Mali be strengthened and everlasting!"

    乌斯曼·巴在几内亚、马里联合访华友好代表团回到巴马科时发表讲话
    毛主席的接见使我们感到欢欣鼓舞
    中国帮助修建几内亚——马里铁路对发展民族经济具有重大意义
    新华社巴马科二十八日电　由马里外交部长乌斯曼·巴和几内亚外交部长兰萨纳·贝阿沃吉率领的几内亚、马里联合访华友好代表团，在中国进行访问后，在二十八日下午乘飞机到达巴马科。
    到机场迎接代表团的有：马里保卫革命全国委员会成员、司法和劳工部长马马杜·马戴拉·凯塔，新闻和游览部长马马杜·戈洛戈和外交部秘书长比拉马·特拉奥雷。中国驻马里大使馆临时代办刘和林也到机场迎接。
    在稍作停留后，贝阿沃吉和几内亚方面的代表团成员返回几内亚。
    乌斯曼·巴在巴马科机场发表了讲话。他说，几内亚、马里联合访华友好代表团“以在中华人民共和国完成使命的十分满意的心情回来了。在这个伟大、美丽而又无比革命的友好国家里，我们确实是满载而归：一方面洋溢着热烈的战斗友谊以及全面深刻谅解的气氛，同时就技术合作问题——我们此行的目的——以及非洲和国际问题进行了非常热烈和十分坦率的讨论。我们只想证实一下你们通过报刊已经知道的事情，即中华人民共和国将帮助修建几内亚—马里铁路。”他说：“这种铁路联系是我们两国独立以来一直关心的问题，它对于我们两国建设独立的民族经济的进程具有决定性的重要意义。这将是把马里和几内亚联结在一起的一条纽带。”
    乌斯曼·巴说：“马里是一个没有出海口的国家，但在几内亚兄弟人民的声援下，就将根本解决马里在地理上的缺陷，从而使那些不死心的政治地理学家们的恶毒计谋完蛋，他们很久以来一直在马里这个内陆国家的处境上打算盘。”
    乌斯曼·巴强调指出，在北京，“最使我们感到欢欣鼓舞的是，中国人民的伟大领袖、世界革命的杰出导师毛泽东主席接见了几内亚、马里代表团的全体成员。这的确是激动人心的时刻：毛主席身体非常健康，他是一位革命领袖而又那么平易近人，谦虚，他对有关革命的问题进行辩证的分析时所表现的天才的英明远见，他对自己的人民和对社会主义胜利的无限信心，这一切都使我们始终万分钦佩。”
    他在讲话中还谈到毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命给他们留下的深刻的印象。
    乌斯曼·巴说，几内亚、马里联合访华友好代表团“比以往任何时候更加确信，中华人民共和国高高举起反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义的斗争旗帜。代表团同时也确信，中华人民共和国履行它对非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲各国人民以及解放运动斗争的国际主义义务的决心，比以往任何时候都大。这是纯粹的无产阶级国际主义。”
    乌斯曼·巴最后说：“祝中国—几内亚—马里的合作与团结日益加强和万古长青！”
