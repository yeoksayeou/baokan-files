President Julius K. Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania, at the invitation of the Chinese government, arrived in Beijing today for a state visit. Tens of thousands of revolutionary people of the capital, amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, gave a grand welcome to the distinguished guest from the anti-imperialist front in Africa, expressing their warmest greetings to President Nyerere and his wife, as well as to other Tanzanian friends who accompanied them.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Kang Sheng, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, and Li Xiannian, Vice Premier and Chairman of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee Xie Fuzhi, Chief of Staff of the People's Liberation Army Huang Yongsheng, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, and Deng Yingchao, went to the airport to give a warm welcome.

In the unprecedented situation where our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories and the revolutionary struggles against imperialism are flourishing worldwide, President Nyerere, following his visit in 1965, once again comes to our country for a state visit. This is a great support and encouragement to our people, demonstrating the further development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Tanzania and between the peoples of the two countries.

Accompanying President Nyerere on his visit to China are the Deputy Chief of the Second Office of the President R. N. Sijona, Minister of State for the President's Office A. M. Bok Mwanuka, Minister of State in charge of foreign affairs C. Y. Mgonja and his wife, Chairman of the Rufuma Region Isa Mpoto, Commissioner of the Mwanza Region Namata and his wife, Member of the National Executive Committee of the African-Socialist Party Juma Almasy, Member of the Revolutionary Council of Zanzibar Ahmed Mahmoud, Major General of the Tanzanian People's Defense Force Salakiya, Police Commissioner Shaidi, Representative of the Tanganyika African National Union of Arusha Region Michael Indada, Representative of the Tanganyika African National Union of Musoma Region Marusi, Representative of the Tanganyika Youth League Juma Mwapachu, Representative of the Trade Union Federation Regasila, and Representative of the Tanganyika National Women's Union Asha Ngoma, among others.

The sky above the capital airport was adorned with the national flags of China and Tanzania. The tall buildings at the airport were decorated with large banners reading: "Warmly Welcome President Julius K. Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania." At 1:50 PM, the special plane carrying President Nyerere landed. At this time, thousands of welcoming crowds gathered at the airport. After President Nyerere and other Tanzanian guests disembarked from the plane, Premier Zhou Enlai and others expressed their warm welcome. The band played the national anthems of the United Republic of Tanzania and the People's Republic of China. Subsequently, President Nyerere, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and others, inspected the honor guard.

President Nyerere, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, circled the field to meet with the welcoming crowds. At this time, the welcoming crowds enthusiastically shouted: "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania!" "Firmly support the anti-imperialist struggle of the Tanzanian people!" "Long live President Nyerere!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand!" President Nyerere happily walked into the welcoming crowd and took a group photo with them. Then, President Nyerere and others, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and others, left the airport and headed to the city center, where tens of thousands of revolutionary people lined the streets to welcome them.

Today, the streets of Beijing were filled with the atmosphere of friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania. At major intersections in the city, there were giant portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and President Nyerere. Along the more than twenty miles of streets that the guests passed through, countless red flags and the national flags of China and Tanzania were hung across the sky. The tall buildings on both sides of the streets were adorned with numerous red banners, which read in Chinese and Swahili: "Warmly Welcome President Nyerere!" "Long live the unity of Asian and African peoples!" "Firmly support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation!" "Firmly support the struggle of black people in the United States against violence!" "Firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Europe and North America!" "Down with U.S.-led imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique!" "Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!"

President Nyerere and his wife, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, passed through the welcoming crowds in an open-top car, and the broad masses of the capital, filled with the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Tanzanian peoples, held high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and President Nyerere, pouring out the deep friendship of the Chinese people for the Tanzanian people.

When the guests' convoy arrived at the center of the capital, Tiananmen Square, a grand welcoming scene unfolded. Amidst the music of the military band playing "The East Is Red," more than two thousand young men and women performed various dances full of revolutionary enthusiasm. When President Nyerere's car arrived at the west side of Tiananmen Square, many red balloons were released by the welcoming crowd. President Nyerere and his wife expressed their friendly greetings to the welcoming crowd.

When the guests arrived near the Diplomatic Reception Hall, the welcoming crowd held high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly shouted: "Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!"

This evening, the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People was adorned with the national flags of China and Tanzania in the center of the stage. When President Nyerere and other Tanzanian guests arrived at the banquet hall, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and others, the band played the welcoming music, and all the Chinese and foreign guests enthusiastically applauded to express their welcome.

At the banquet, filled with the atmosphere of unity and friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania, Premier Zhou Enlai and President Nyerere spoke one after the other (the summaries of their speeches will be published separately). In their speeches, they both wished for the continuous consolidation and development of the friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania.

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai said that at this moment when our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is about to achieve a comprehensive victory, President Nyerere has come to our country for a friendly visit from afar, which is a great support and encouragement to the Chinese people. He said that President Nyerere's visit this time will certainly make new contributions to further strengthening the fighting friendship between our two peoples and the anti-imperialist cause of the Asian and African peoples.

In his speech, President Nyerere said that since my visit to your great country in 1965, both China and Tanzania have made many important developments. You are carrying out a cultural revolution at home, and I hope to learn more about this during these days.
