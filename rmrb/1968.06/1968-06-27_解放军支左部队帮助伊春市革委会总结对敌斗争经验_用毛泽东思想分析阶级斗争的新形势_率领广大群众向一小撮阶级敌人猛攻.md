The PLA support-left forces in the Yichun Forest Area, following Chairman Mao's great directive to "never forget class struggle," have assisted the Yichun City Revolutionary Committee in frequently using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the new situation and trends in class struggle. They have summarized new experiences in struggle against the enemy, proposed new tasks for struggle against the enemy, and led the broad revolutionary masses in ceaselessly attacking a handful of class enemies. This has enabled the Revolutionary Committee to fully play its role as a battle command center in class struggle, developing a great situation.

Since the establishment of the Yichun City Revolutionary Committee, the revolution and production have shown a great situation. To continue pushing the revolution forward in this new situation, the support-left forces and the Revolutionary Committee comrades have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great directive on "imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat, they will make their last struggle." They have recognized that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads will become. Therefore, one must not become arrogant and complacent, or slack off and relax the struggle against the enemy because of victory. One must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the revolutionary struggle's direction, frequently analyze the new situation in class struggle, grasp the initiative in class struggle, and advance victoriously. Thus, starting this year, according to the different situations in different periods, they have consecutively held four meetings attended by leading members of the revolutionary committees at various grassroots units and PLA support-left personnel. At the meetings, through studying Chairman Mao's latest directives, they have researched the new situations in grassroots class struggle, summarized new experiences in struggle against the enemy, seen through the new trends and characteristics in the activities of class enemies after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, clarified the new situation in class struggle, proposed new tasks for struggle against the enemy, grasped the initiative in class struggle, and severely struck down a handful of class enemies.

Every time the support-left forces in the Yichun Forest Area assist the Yichun City Revolutionary Committee in holding a meeting, they use Mao Zedong Thought as the guide to study the activity laws of class enemies and propose new battle tasks. In March this year, some grassroots revolutionary committee members in the forest area, due to their unclear understanding of the new situation in class struggle, temporarily relaxed the revolutionary criticism. A handful of class enemies hiding in dark corners took the opportunity to stir up trouble, directing their spears at the Revolutionary Committee and the PLA support-left forces, attempting to reverse the verdict. Facing this situation, the support-left forces immediately assisted the City Revolutionary Committee in holding a meeting, organizing leading members of revolutionary committees at various levels and PLA support-left personnel to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on "our important task on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism" and "all revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power, consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against revolutionary forces is also entirely for maintaining their power," and seriously analyze the new situation in current class struggle. They proposed the task of struggle against the enemy: fully mobilizing the masses, deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism, launching a fierce attack on class enemies, and thoroughly smashing the rightist reversal wind stirred up by class enemies. After the meeting, leading members of revolutionary committees at various levels and PLA support-left personnel went deep into the grassroots, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the broad revolutionary masses. They quickly exposed a handful of diehard capitalist-roaders and other class enemies attempting to reverse the verdict, smashed their plots, and made the revolutionary committees at various levels more consolidated in the struggle against the enemy.

The support-left forces and the Revolutionary Committee, to better promote advanced experiences and guide the struggle against the enemy, have, every time they hold a meeting, used Chairman Mao's latest directives as the guideline. They have mobilized leading members of revolutionary committees at various levels and support-left personnel to seriously summarize and widely exchange experiences in struggle against the enemy. They have timely summarized and promoted the experiences of the Production Committee of the City Revolutionary Committee in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, mobilizing revolutionary masses to seriously implement the Party's policies, strictly distinguishing between the two types of different nature contradictions, and accurately, firmly, and severely striking down a handful of class enemies. They have also promoted the experiences of units such as the Friendship Wood Processing Comprehensive Factory Revolutionary Committee in firmly grasping the struggle against the enemy and achieving major victories, greatly promoting the in-depth development of the city-wide struggle against the enemy. To enable leading members of revolutionary committees at various levels and support-left personnel to specifically understand the new characteristics of class struggle in the new situation, the support-left forces and the Yichun City Revolutionary Committee, during the recent fourth meeting, also moved the meeting to grassroots units. They participated in the struggle-criticism meetings against class enemies together with the revolutionary masses at grassroots units, enabling everyone to see the living class struggle reality, greatly raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

    解放军支左部队帮助伊春市革委会总结对敌斗争经验
    用毛泽东思想分析阶级斗争的新形势
    率领广大群众向一小撮阶级敌人猛攻
    据新华社哈尔滨二十六日电　人民解放军驻伊春林区支左部队遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，帮助伊春市革命委员会经常用毛泽东思想分析阶级斗争新形势、新动向，总结对敌斗争新经验，提出对敌斗争新任务，率领广大革命群众不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻，使革命委员会在阶级斗争中充分发挥了战斗指挥部作用，发展了大好形势。
    伊春市革命委员会成立以后，革命、生产出现一片大好形势。为了在新形势下把革命继续推向前进，支左部队和革委会同志们一起，反复学习了毛主席关于“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎”的伟大教导，认识到，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，越是复杂，越是深刻。因此，决不能因为胜利，就骄傲和麻痹、懈怠起来，放松对敌斗争。必须紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向，经常分析阶级斗争新形势，掌握阶级斗争主动权，乘胜前进。于是，他们从今年开始，根据不同时期的不同情况，连续召开了四次由各基层单位革命委员会领导成员和解放军支左人员参加的会议。会上，通过学习毛主席的最新指示，研究基层阶级斗争新情况，总结对敌斗争新经验，看清了在革委会成立后阶级敌人活动的新动向、新特点，明确了阶级斗争的新形势，提出了对敌斗争的新任务，掌握了阶级斗争的主动权，狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    驻伊春林区支左部队帮助伊春市革委会召开每一次会议，都以毛泽东思想为指南，研究阶级敌人的活动规律，提出新的战斗任务。今年三月，林区有的基层革委会成员由于对阶级斗争的新形势认识不清，一时放松了革命大批判。隐藏在阴暗角落里的一小撮阶级敌人，乘机兴风作浪，把矛头指向革命委员会和解放军支左部队，妄图翻案。针对这种情况，支左部队立即帮助市革委会召开会议，组织各级革委会领导成员和解放军支左人员反复学习毛主席关于“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”和“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权”等教导，认真分析了当前阶级斗争的新形势，提出了对敌斗争任务：充分发动群众，深入开展革命的大批判，猛烈地向阶级敌人发动进攻，彻底粉碎阶级敌人刮起的右倾翻案妖风。会后，各级革委会成员、解放军支左人员深入到基层，和广大革命群众并肩战斗，很快揪出了一小撮妄图翻案的顽固不化的走资派和其他阶级敌人，粉碎了他们的阴谋，使各级革委会在对敌斗争中更加巩固。
    支左部队和革委会为了更好地推广先进经验，指导对敌斗争，每次召开会议，都以毛主席最新指示为指针，发动各级革委会成员和支左人员认真总结、广泛交流对敌斗争经验。他们及时总结推广了市革委会生产委员会举办毛泽东思想学习班，发动革命群众认真贯彻执行党的政策，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人的经验，以及友好木材综合加工厂革委会等单位狠抓对敌斗争，取得重大胜利的经验，大大推动了全市对敌斗争的深入发展。为了使各级革委会成员和支左人员具体认识到新形势下阶级斗争的新特点，支左部队和伊春市革委会在最近召开的第四次会议期间，还把会议搬到基层单位去开，和基层单位革命群众一起参加对阶级敌人批判斗争会，使大家看到活生生的阶级斗争现实，极大地提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
