The U.S. imperialists have intensified their exploitation and plunder of the Chilean people, causing the economic situation in this South American country to deteriorate further.

Chile is a major copper-producing country. However, for a long time, more than 90% of Chile's copper mining has been controlled by the Anaconda and Braden copper companies of the United States, which annually plunder approximately $100 million in profits.

Since 1964, the United States, in order to serve its aggressive war policies and the interests of its monopolies, has expanded its plunder of Chilean copper under the guise of "joint ventures" with Chilean capital. For example, the Anaconda Copper Company of the United States, under the pretense of "jointly" developing with Chile, has seized control of the newly discovered "El Teniente" copper mine with an absolute majority of shares. The ore reserves of this copper mine exceed 100 million tons.

Moreover, according to the conditions imposed by the U.S. copper companies on Chile, Chile has halved the tax rate on the profits of U.S. copper companies and exempted these companies from tariffs on equipment and materials imported from the United States.

The production of copper has increased. However, when Chile exports its share of copper to the United States, it faces the impact of the U.S. price-cutting policy. In 1966, when Chile exported a batch of 90,000 tons of copper to the United States, it had to sell it at 36 cents per pound, while the international market price for copper at the time was 82.8 cents per pound. Just from the sale of this batch of copper, Chile suffered a loss of $9.29 million.

Chile nominally "jointly operates" with the United States, but the money it used to purchase part of the shares of the U.S. copper companies was borrowed from the United States.

The "joint venture" policy pursued by U.S. monopoly capital further exacerbates the deterioration of Chile's economic situation. Chile's national debt increases, its currency continuously devalues, and prices rose by 17% in the first eight months of last year.

However, the burden of economic deterioration is shifted onto the working people. According to the "joint venture" conditions and loan conditions imposed by the U.S. copper companies and financial institutions, the U.S. copper companies arbitrarily refuse to fulfill the regulations for improving the living conditions of Chilean copper miners, while the Chilean authorities, under the orders of U.S. monopoly capital, suppress workers' wages.

### 对智利人民巧取豪夺

    对智利人民巧取豪夺
    美帝国主义加紧对智利人民的剥削和掠夺，使这个南美国家的经济情况日益恶化。
    智利是盛产铜的国家。但是，长期以来，智利铜的百分之九十以上的开采量，却控制在美国的安那康达和布拉登两家铜公司手里，它们每年平均要掠夺一亿美元的利润。
    从一九六四年起，美国为了它的侵略战争政策的需要和垄断集团的利益，在同智利资本“联营”的掩护下，扩大了对智利铜的掠夺。例如美国的安那康达铜公司在同智利“合伙”开发的幌子下，以占绝对优势的股份，攫取了控制新发现的“埃克索蒂加”铜矿的开采权利。这个铜矿的蕴藏量在一亿吨以上。
    不仅如此，根据美国铜公司强加给智利的条件，智利把它征收美国铜公司利润税的税率降低一半，并且免征这些铜公司从美国进口的设备和物资的关税。
    铜的产量增加了。可是，智利把它所占有的份额的铜向美国出口时，却遭到美国的压价政策的打击。一九六六年，智利在向美国出口一批数量为九万吨铜的时候，就不得不以每磅三十六分（美元）出售，而当时国际市场上的铜价是每磅八十二·八美分。光是出售这一批铜，智利就损失了九千二百九十万美元。
    智利名义上同美国“联营”，但它购买美国铜公司部分股份的钱又是从美国借来的。
    美国垄断资本推行的这种“联营”政策，进一步促使智利经济情况的恶化。智利的国家债务增加，货币连续贬值，物价在去年头八个月中，就上涨了百分之十七。
    但是，经济恶化的重担却被转嫁到劳动人民身上。根据美国铜公司和金融机构所强加的“联营”条件和贷款条件，美国铜公司蛮横地拒不履行改善智利铜矿工人生活条件的规定，而智利当局在美国垄断资本的命令下压低工人工资。
