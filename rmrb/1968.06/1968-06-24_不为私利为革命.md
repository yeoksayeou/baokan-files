	Not for Personal Gain but for the Revolution
	Worker Wú Yuǎn Bì

	Just like all new and old revisionists, China's Khrushchev always tries to use "material incentives" to lure us down the capitalist road. He advocates working for money. This is the greatest slander against our working class!

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The working class has the greatest foresight, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." Chairman Mao's teachings are the greatest motivation for us workers to do our jobs well and to produce well. I, from being a worker's family member, have become an honorable military supply worker, with only one thought in mind: to wholeheartedly be a good worker for Chairman Mao.

	When I first entered the factory, I was assigned to learn disassembly and assembly of vehicles. This job requires outdoor work. The work is heavy and tiring. At the same time, I heard the talk that girls can't do carpentry. But I thought, doing revolution can't be picky and choose the easy way out, avoiding hard work. I happily accepted this job and worked hard. A few times when I was sick, I secretly tore up my sick leave and insisted on working. I thought, assembling vehicles is to annihilate class enemies, liberate all humanity, and every vehicle repaired adds a bit of strength to our preparedness. This is how I became a general worker for eight years.

	During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party pushed economicism, inciting some uninformed people to demand higher wages. Some workers in my factory left their production posts. Following Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," I did not leave the factory for a single step and firmly guarded my production post. For the revolutionary cause, who cares about a bit of hardship? Even if it means shedding blood and sacrificing, I am willing. One afternoon, the wood drying room suddenly caught fire. I saw thick smoke rolling and the fire raging. I thought: these are all top-grade materials, state property, and preparedness materials, which absolutely cannot be allowed to be burned to ashes. Fire is the order! The drying room is the battlefield! I rushed into the drying room! The brick walls and steel pipes were red hot, the thick smoke choked, and the fierce fire scorched, making it impossible to open one's eyes or breathe. But fire can burn wood, burn steel-reinforced concrete, yet it cannot burn away the revolutionary heart of our working class. After more than an hour of battle, the wood was moved out of the drying room, and the fire was extinguished. At this time, my face and hands were scorched and painful, and my nose was bleeding. Despite this, I did not leave my production post. Am I doing this for personal material gain? No! Absolutely not! It is for the revolution, to safeguard the factory's safety, to repair more vehicles, and to support the People's Liberation Army in annihilating domestic and foreign class enemies.

	The source of our production enthusiasm is Chairman Mao's teaching: "Treat revolutionary interests as your first priority," "be selfless, work hard, be self-disciplined and public-spirited, and work hard." China's Khrushchev, like a disgusting woodworm, always tries to use his rotten selfishness to corrupt the souls of the working people, making us into selfish individuals. We must eliminate China's Khrushchev's poison, just as we eliminate woodworms.

    不为私利为革命
    女工　吴远碧
    象一切新老修正主义者一样，中国赫鲁晓夫总是想用“物质刺激”来诱骗我们走资本主义道路。他鼓吹为拿钱而干活。这是对我们工人阶级最大的诬蔑！
    毛主席教导我们：“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”毛主席的教导，就是我们工人阶级做好工作、搞好生产的最大动力。我由一个职工家属，成了一名光荣的军需工人，只有一个心眼，就是一心一意要做毛主席的好工人。
    刚进厂分配我学拆车、装车。这个活要在露天作业。活又重又累。同时，又听到女娃儿不能干木工的议论。可是我想，干革命就不能挑挑拣拣，拈轻怕重。我愉快地接受了这一个工作，使劲地干。有几次生病，我偷偷地撕掉假条，坚持工作。我想，装车是为了消灭阶级敌人，解放全人类，早修好一辆车，就为战备增添一分力量。我就是这样当了八年的杂工。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，党内一小撮走资派搞经济主义，挑动一部分不明真相的人闹工资。我厂有些职工离开了生产岗位。我遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的教导，一步也没离开工厂，坚守生产岗位。为了革命工作，莫说是辛苦点，就是流血牺牲也情愿。一天下午，烘木料的房子突然起了火，只见浓烟滚滚，火势凶猛。我想：这全是头等木料，是国家财产，战备物资，决不能眼睁睁地看着被火烧掉。火光，就是命令！烘房就是战场！我冲进了烘房！砖墙、钢管烧红了，浓烟呛，烈火烤，使人睁不开眼，喘不过气。但是，火能烧毁木料，烧毁钢筋混凝土，却烧不毁我们工人阶级的一颗革命的红心。经过一个多小时的战斗，木料搬出了烘房，火也扑灭了。这时，我脸上和手上的皮肤都烤得火辣辣的痛，鼻子出血。尽管这样，也没有离开生产岗位。我这样做，难道是为了个人的物质利益吗？不！绝对不是！是为了革命，为了保卫工厂安全，修更多的车，支援中国人民解放军消灭国内外阶级敌人。
    我们生产积极性的来源，就是毛主席的教导：“以革命利益为第一生命”，“大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干”。中国赫鲁晓夫，象可恶的蛀木虫子一样，总是妄图用他那一套利己主义的破烂货，来腐蚀劳动人民的灵魂，使我们变成一个利己主义者。我们要象消灭蛀木虫子一样，消除中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒。
