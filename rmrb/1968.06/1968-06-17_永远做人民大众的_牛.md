Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I was an ordinary member of the production team, working in the fields all year round, braving wind and rain, and never missing a day of work without reason. Everyone affectionately called me the "Iron Girl." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I, along with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary young people in our brigade, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, charging forward bravely and fighting fiercely. However, after I became a member of the commune revolutionary committee, some people in the masses said to me, "If you float on top and don't go down, how can you hold the power for us poor and lower-middle peasants!"

When I heard these words, I thought: I am busy all day with meetings and reports, and how can it be said that I am floating on top and not going down? Some revolutionary old cadres in the commune revolutionary committee discovered my thoughts and had a heart-to-heart talk with me. One old cadre told me about his personal experience, saying, "Comrade Xiulan, I used to not listen to the masses' criticism and made mistakes..." Some cadres also gave me Chairman Mao's quotations on the mass line to study. After studying Chairman Mao's teachings, my mind became clear. I realized that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the most thorough mass line. Whether or not to listen to the masses' opinions is not just a matter of work style, but a manifestation of the struggle between two worldviews and two lines, a matter of whether one is loyal to Chairman Mao or not. I also realized that the masses have the keenest eyes and the clearest sense of right and wrong. The opinions they raised to me are very correct. My work is indeed hard, but if I float on top all day, do not go deep into the masses, and do not work and study with the masses, I will inevitably change over time. How can the masses not criticize me? Chairman Mao teaches us: "To be the 'ox' for the proletariat and the masses, to dedicate oneself to the end, and to die only after completing one's mission." Since I have made mistakes, the revolutionary masses criticizing me is to urge me on and care for me, and I should not have any resistance. Accepting the masses' opinions and improving myself can make us heart to heart, united as one, and advance victoriously along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Through study, my thoughts have greatly improved. From then on, I went deep into the production team near my home and, together with the masses, grasped revolution and promoted production. Sometimes, after returning from a meeting, if it was not yet time to stop work, no matter how long or short the time, I would go to the fields and work with the community members, study with them. I also often had heart-to-heart talks with the masses, solicited their opinions, and improved my work. In this way, the masses' opinion of me changed, and some even praised me, saying, "Xiulan doing this is truly a good child of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and can truly hold and use power for us poor and lower-middle peasants!" Later, based on the masses' opinions, I set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the fields, fiercely criticized the reactionary revisionist fallacies of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms" by China's Khrushchev, and promoted the village to further launch a high tide of revolutionary criticism, which strongly promoted the thought revolution of the broad masses of community members. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants all established the great ambition to "farm for revolution" and were determined to achieve a good harvest this year.

    永远做人民大众的“牛”
    辽宁省新金县瓦窝公社革命委员会委员　滕秀兰
    无产阶级文化大革命以前，我是生产队里的一个普通社员，一年到头顶风冒雨参加生产劳动，从来没有无故误过工。大伙都亲切地称我是“铁姑娘”。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我和我们大队的广大贫下中农、革命小将一起，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，勇往直前，猛打猛冲。可是，就在我成为公社革命委员会委员以后，群众中有人说我：“浮在上面不向下，怎能为咱贫下中农掌好印把！”
    我听了这些话，心想：我一天到黑不是开会就是汇报，忙得不可开交，怎么能说我浮在上面不向下呢？公社革命委员会里的一些革命老干部发现了我的活思想后，就同我谈心。有一位老干部用亲身经历对我说：“秀兰同志，我过去就是听不进群众的批评，才犯了错误……。”有的老干部还选送毛主席有关群众路线的语录，让我学习。我学了毛主席的教导，心中开朗起来，我认识到，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是最彻底的群众路线。能不能听取群众的意见，这绝不是简单的工作作风问题，而是两种世界观、两条路线斗争的表现，是关系到忠不忠于毛主席的大问题。我同时认识到，群众眼睛最亮，是非最清，向我提的意见非常对。我的工作虽然辛苦，但整天浮在上面，不深入群众，不和群众一起参加劳动，天长日久，非变不可，怎么能怪群众对我提出批评呢？毛主席教导我们：要“做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”既然我有了毛病，革命群众批评我，是鞭策我，爱护我，不应该有抵触情绪。接受群众意见，认真改进，才能做到上下心连心，拧成一股绳，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。
    通过学习，我的思想有了很大的提高。从此，我就深入到我家跟前的生产队，和群众一起抓革命促生产。有时开会回来，还不到收工时间，不管时间长短，也到田间和社员一起劳动，一起学习。我还经常和群众谈心，征求群众意见，改进工作。就这样，群众对我的看法就转变了，有的还夸奖说：“秀兰这样做，才是咱贫下中农的好儿女，才能为咱贫下中农掌好权用好权啊！”后来，我又根据群众的意见，在地头上办起毛泽东思想学习班，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义谬论，推动村里进一步掀起了革命大批判的高潮，有力地促进了广大社员群众的思想革命化。广大贫下中农都树立起“为革命种田”的雄心壮志，决心夺取今年农业的好收成。
