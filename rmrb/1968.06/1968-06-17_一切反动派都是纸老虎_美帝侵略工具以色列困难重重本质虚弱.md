The great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "In the history of mankind, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their final struggles against the revolutionary forces."

Israel, under the patronage of U.S. imperialism and the encouragement of the Soviet revisionist leadership, has been extremely arrogant, frequently launching new military provocations against Arab countries and brutally suppressing the Arab people in the occupied areas. However, under the continuous armed struggle of the Palestinian people, just like all reactionaries, the Israeli aggressors are overwhelmed, facing numerous difficulties, and increasingly exposing their intrinsic weakness.

I.

The purpose of Israel's military provocations and war threats is clear: it aims to consolidate its occupation, realize the expansionist plot of "Greater Israel," and force Arab countries to recognize the status quo after the U.S.-Israeli aggression, accept its conditions, and create a favorable position for its new aggression. Shortly after the U.S.-Israeli aggression last year, former U.S. Vice President Nixon said in Israel that Israel's "victory" in the military sphere is a historic opportunity for a "durable peace" solution between Israel and its neighbors. The U.S. *Chicago Sun-Times* revealed that the Johnson administration agreed to "adjust" Israel's "borders" to strengthen Israel's "position." Israeli Defense Minister Dayan bluntly stated: "The position of the United States in the Middle East must be strengthened." The ambitions of Israeli Zionists are also encouraged by the Soviet revisionists. According to reports, in August last year, then Canadian Prime Minister Pearson, after receiving a secret letter from Kosygin, said that the Soviet Union "agrees that the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the signing of a ceasefire agreement should be linked to Israel's border security and recognition of Israel." These are ironclad evidence of the U.S.-Soviet collusion in encouraging Israel to invade the Arab people.

II.

Over the past year, U.S. imperialism has strengthened Israel, this base of aggression, from all sides, making Israel's arrogance even more brazen. After the June War last year, the United States continued to provide Israel with "Skyhawk" fighter-bombers, and the training of Israeli air force pilots by the United States has never stopped. At the beginning of this year, Johnson and Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol issued a joint statement announcing that the U.S. government "agrees to actively and sympathetically study Israel's military defensive capabilities." According to an Arab weekly, during the talks between Johnson and Eshkol, both sides fully agreed on the need to maintain Israel's "military superiority."

With the encouragement and support of the United States, from 1950 to 1968, Israel's "defense budget" increased by seventy-four times. In addition to a large amount of military expenditure, Israel has also announced the extension of the service period. For a long time, Israel has been implementing a fascist-style military training, where everyone is forced to serve in the military and the so-called "soldier-citizen" system is implemented.

In the economic sphere, after the June War, to enhance Israel's war capabilities, the United States provided Israel with $200 million in reserves, greatly increasing Israel's foreign exchange reserves, enabling it to purchase a large amount of military weapons from West Germany, Belgium, and other Western countries.

For a long time, the United States has been unremitting in its support for Israel. The United States uses a large amount of money to feed this "Israel" it created. Since 1948, Israel has borrowed $7 billion from the United States and other countries. According to reports, 57% of Israel's entire income comes from "U.S. aid." In early March last year, U.S. and Western Jewish capitalists held an "International Economic Conference" in Jerusalem, discussing the investment of one billion pounds in Israel over the next ten years to strengthen Israel's economic and military aggression capabilities.

III.

While strengthening its military and economic power, Israel has greatly intensified its suppression and persecution in the occupied areas, committing various atrocities. In February this year, Israel brazenly announced that the Arab territories it occupied in the June aggression last year would be renamed "military occupied zones," legalizing its occupation, and changed the administrative status of Jerusalem, annexing the Arab districts of the city. The Israeli Zionist reactionary authorities illegally deprive Arabs of their legal rights in the occupied areas, arbitrarily seize Arab property, "requisition" Arab land, impose heavy taxes on Arabs, and brutally persecute Palestinian guerrillas and their families. Thousands of Palestinian guerrillas have been killed, imprisoned, and interrogated.

Even more sinister is that Israel, through the extremely reactionary policy of "Jewish immigration," carries out frenzied national oppression against Arabs, which has received active support from the reactionary Jewish organizations in the United States and the West. The essence of Israel's "Jewish immigration" is to move Zionists from America and Europe to Israel to strengthen Israel's economic and war capabilities, frenziedly plunder and expel Arabs, and achieve its ambition to permanently occupy the territory of Palestine and other Arab countries.

Israel's "Jewish immigration" is developing at an astonishing speed. In 1948, there were only 790,000 Jews in Palestine, now there are 2.3 million. To accommodate these "Jewish immigrants," the Israeli authorities, through various means, seize Arab land, plunder Arab property, and drive Arabs out of their homes.

IV.

Although the June War last year caused a temporary setback for the Arab countries, the U.S.-Israeli aggression is unjust, and it has been strongly condemned by the revolutionary people of the world and all Arab people. With the widespread spread of Mao Zedong Thought in the Arab region, over the past year, the armed struggle of the Palestinian people has been burning more fiercely, the anti-U.S. tide in the Middle East has been rising higher and higher, and the Arab people are in a new awakening, while the U.S. and Israel are in a very isolated position. The U.S.-Israeli military aggression against Arab countries and the brutal persecution of the Arab people do not indicate the strength of U.S. imperialism and its running dog Israel; on the contrary, they expose their intrinsic weakness. The Israeli aggressors, in their frenzied military expansion, have made their front lines longer and longer, and their troops feel more and more inadequate, especially facing the thriving armed struggle of the Palestinian people, guerrilla forces striking day and night across the country, making the Israeli aggressors suffer blows everywhere and in a miserable state. Israeli warlord Dayan also had to admit that the war against Palestine is "long-term and complex."

The brutal suppression by Israel has aroused increasingly strong resistance from the Arab residents in the occupied areas. Protests and demonstrations have been frequent, and on May 2nd and 15th, Arab residents held strikes, boycotts, and shutdowns, indicating the rising struggle of Arab residents.

V.

Israel's aggression war has caused it serious economic difficulties. Israel's occupation costs amount to $1 billion; before the June War, Israel's budget deficit had already reached $450 million. Due to the war economy, Israel's trade deficit has greatly increased, causing inflation, and a large number of workers have become unemployed. According to official figures from Israel, the labor force in the industrial sector has decreased from 190,000 to 160,000. The Israeli side admits that the number of unemployed has reached 150,000. According to the *Washington Sunday Star*, Israel's economic situation is shaky, and some Israeli soldiers who have just returned from the battlefield almost have to be included in the subsidy list as soon as they take off their dusty uniforms. Israel has a "unemployment camp" of 30,000 people, and the number of people in this "unemployment camp" is increasing day by day.

Another manifestation of Israel's economic difficulties is the decline in production. Israel's output in 1966 was 900 million Israeli pounds less than expected. To get out of its difficulties, the Israeli reactionary authorities, in the face of rising prices, implement the so-called "austerity policy," freezing wages for two years.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Reactionary forces face difficulties just as we do. But the difficulties of reactionary forces are insurmountable because they are forces that are approaching death and have no future. Our difficulties are surmountable because we are new and have a bright future."

In the face of various insurmountable difficulties faced by the U.S.-Israeli aggressors, the Palestinian people, after arduous exploration, have found that armed struggle is the only way to achieve liberation. As long as the Arab people strengthen their unity and persist in the struggle, they will definitely achieve final victory in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel.

    一切反动派都是纸老虎
    美帝侵略工具以色列困难重重本质虚弱
    以色列在美帝国主义的扶植和苏修领导集团的怂恿下，气焰十分嚣张，频繁地向阿拉伯国家发动新的军事挑衅，并对被占领区内的阿拉伯人进行疯狂镇压。但是，在巴勒斯坦人民武装斗争的不断打击下，正如一切反动派一样，以色列侵略者穷于应付，困难重重，越来越暴露出它的虚弱本质。
    一
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。
    以色列的军事挑衅和战争叫嚣的目的十分清楚，它企图在美苏的支持和纵容下，巩固它的占领，实现“大以色列”的扩张主义阴谋，迫使阿拉伯国家承认美以侵略战争以后的现状，接受它的条件，为它的新侵略造成有利的地位。前美国副总统尼克松在去年美以发动侵略战争之后不久就在以色列说，以色列在军事上的“胜利”，是以色列同它的邻国之间取得“持久和平”解决办法的一个历史性的机会。美国《芝加哥太阳报》曾经透露，约翰逊政府同意“调整”以色列的“边界”，以便使以色列的“地位”得到“加强”。以色列国防部长达扬露骨地说：“美国在中东的地位必须加强。”以色列犹太复国主义分子的野心，也得到苏修的鼓励。据报道，去年八月，当时的加拿大总理皮尔逊在接到柯西金密信之后说，苏联“同意以色列军队的撤退和停战协定的签订，应同以色列的边界安全和对以色列的承认联系起来。”这些都是美苏合谋纵容以色列，侵略阿拉伯人民的铁证。
    二
    一年来，美帝国主义从各方面来加强以色列这个侵略基地，使得以色列的气焰越来越嚣张。去年六月战争后，美国继续向以色列提供“空中之鹰”式战斗轰炸机，美国为以色列训练空军飞行人员从未停止过。今年年初约翰逊和以色列总理艾希科尔发表的声明宣布，美国政府“同意以色列军事防御能力进行积极的、同情的研究”。据一家阿拉伯周刊透露，在约翰逊和艾希科尔的会谈中，双方完全同意保持以色列的“军事优势”的需要。
    在美国的鼓励和支持下，从一九五○年到一九六八年，以色列“国防预算”猛增了七十四倍。除了大量的军费外，以色列还宣布延长服役期限。以色列长久以来就推行一种法西斯式的军事训练，人人都要强制服兵役，实行所谓“士兵——公民”制度。
    在经济方面，六月战争以后，为了增强以色列的战争实力，美国向以色列提供了二亿美元的储备，使以色列的外汇储备大大增加，得以从西德、比利时等西方国家购买大量军火武器。
    长期以来，美国对以色列的扶植是不遗余力的。美国用大量的金钱来喂养这个它一手制造出来的“以色列国”。从一九四八年以来，以色列从美国等国家借债已达七十亿美元。据报道，以色列整个收入的百分之五十七是来自“美援”。去年三月初，美国和西方国家的一些犹太资本家在耶路撒冷开了一个所谓“国际经济会议”，讨论了今后十年将向以色列投资十亿英镑，来加强以色列在经济上和军事上的侵略实力。
    三
    以色列在强化军事力量和经济力量的同时，大大加强了在占领区的镇压和迫害，犯下了种种血腥罪行。今年二月以色列悍然宣布，把去年六月侵略战争中它所侵占的阿拉伯领土改称为“军事占领区”，使它的占领合法化，并改变了耶路撒冷的行政地位，并吞了这个城市的阿拉伯人区。以色列犹太复国主义反动当局在以占区非法剥夺阿拉伯人的合法权利，任意没收阿拉伯人的财产，“征用”阿拉伯人的土地，对阿拉伯人横征暴敛，还残暴地迫害巴勒斯坦游击队员和他们的家属，成千的巴勒斯坦游击队员遭到杀害、监禁和审讯。
    尤其恶毒的是，以色列通过“犹太移民”这一极其反动的种族主义政策，对阿拉伯人实行疯狂的民族压迫，这得到了美国和西方的反动的犹太人组织的积极支持。以色列“犹太移民”的实质，就是要把美洲和欧洲的犹太复国主义者移民到以色列去，增强以色列的经济和战争力量，疯狂掠夺和排挤阿拉伯人，以达到它永远霸占巴勒斯坦和其它阿拉伯国家的领土的野心。
    以色列的“犹太移民”以惊人的速度发展着。一九四八年在巴勒斯坦只有七十九万犹太人，现在已增加到二百三十万人。为了安置这些“犹太移民”，以色列当局通过种种手段，霸占阿拉伯人的土地，掠夺阿拉伯人的财产，把阿拉伯人赶出他们的家园。
    四
    尽管去年六月战争使阿拉伯国家受到暂时的挫折，但是美以侵略战争是非正义的，它遭到全世界革命人民、全体阿拉伯人民的愤怒谴责。随着毛泽东思想在阿拉伯地区的广泛传播，一年来，巴勒斯坦人民武装斗争的烈火越烧越旺，中东地区的反美浪潮一浪高过一浪，阿拉伯人民正处在新的觉醒中，而美以却处于十分孤立的地位。美以对阿拉伯国家的军事侵略和对阿拉伯人民的残酷迫害，并不表明美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的强大，相反恰恰暴露了它们的虚弱本质。以色列侵略者疯狂地进行军事扩张，使它的战线越来越长，兵力越感不足，尤其是它面临着蓬勃发展的巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争，遍及全境的游击队日夜出击，使以色列侵略者处处挨打，狼狈不堪。以色列战争头子达扬也不得不承认对巴勒斯坦的战争是“长期的、复杂的”。
    以色列的残暴镇压，激起了占领区内阿拉伯居民越来越强烈的反抗。游行示威此伏彼起，五月二日和十五日阿拉伯居民举行了罢工、罢课、罢市，这表明了阿拉伯居民斗争的高涨。
    五
    以色列的侵略战争，造成了它的严重的经济困难。以色列的占领费高达十亿美元；六月战争以前，以色列的预算赤字就已达到四亿五千万美元。由于战争经济，以色列贸易入超大大增加，发生通货膨胀，大量劳动力失业。据以色列官方公布数字，工业方面的劳动力由原来的十九万人减少到十六万人。以色列方面承认，失业人口已达十五万人。据《华盛顿星期日明星晚报》说，以色列的经济情况摇摇欲坠，一些从战场上下来的以色列士兵几乎一脱下他们满是尘土的军装就得列入受补助的名单。以色列有一个三万人的“失业营”，而这个“失业营”的人数还在一天天增长。
    以色列经济困难的另一个表现是生产衰退，以色列一九六六年的产值比预计减少了九亿以镑。以色列反动当局为了摆脱它的困难，在物价不断上涨的情况下，实行所谓“节制政策”，冻结工资两年。
    毛主席教导说：“反动势力面前和我们面前都有困难。但是反动势力的困难是不可能克服的，因为他们是接近于死亡的没有前途的势力。我们的困难是能够克服的，因为我们是新兴的有光明前途的势力。”
    在美以侵略者面临种种无法克服的困难情况下，巴勒斯坦人民经过艰苦的摸索，已经找到了武装斗争是他们取得解放的唯一的道路。阿拉伯人民只要加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能在反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的斗争中取得最后胜利。
