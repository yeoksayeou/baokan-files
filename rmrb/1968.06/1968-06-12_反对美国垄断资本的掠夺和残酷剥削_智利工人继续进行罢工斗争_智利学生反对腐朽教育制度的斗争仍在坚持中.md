Workers in Chile Continue Strike Struggles
Students in Chile Persist in Their Fight Against a Rotten Educational System

	SANTIAGO, June 8 (Xinhua) - Workers at the Chilean Oil Company, controlled by the American Rockefeller Group, and employees at the Osorno-La Union Bank's Santiago branch announced a strike on June 7 in the Chilean capital, Santiago. They demanded wage increases and improved living conditions, opposing the brutal exploitation by American monopoly capital.

	Meanwhile, the strike struggles of metallurgical and textile workers in Concepcion, an important industrial city in Chile, and employees of the national airline LAN-Chile, continue to develop.

	According to reports, as foreign monopoly capital intensifies its infiltration and plunder of Chile, the country's economic situation has increasingly worsened. The currency has continuously depreciated, and living expenses have surged. Last year, the Chilean currency depreciated by 32 percent; so far this year, it has depreciated ten more times. In the first five months of this year, living expenses have risen by 15.4 percent. The lives of the broad masses of laboring people have become increasingly impoverished.

	In addition, the struggle of a large number of students at the University of Chile against the rotten bourgeois educational system continues. On June 7, progressive teachers and representatives of progressive researchers affiliated with the university publicly stated their support for the broad masses of students, opposing the reactionary elements within the university who are colluding with revisionists to sabotage the students' strike.

    新华社八日讯　圣地亚哥消息：美国洛克菲勒财团控制的智利石油公司的职工和奥索尔诺—拉乌尼翁银行圣地亚哥分行的职工，七日在智利首都圣地亚哥宣布罢工，要求增加工资和改善生活待遇，反对美国垄断资本的残酷剥削。
    与此同时，智利重要工业城市康塞普西翁的冶金工人和纺织工人以及智利全国航空公司的职工的罢工斗争，正在继续发展中。
    据报道，由于外国垄断资本正在加紧对智利的渗透和掠夺，近年来智利经济状况日益恶化。货币不断贬值，生活费用急剧上涨。去年一年中，智利货币贬值了百分之三十二；而今年到目前为止已再次贬值了十次；在今年头五个月中，生活费用已经上涨了百分之十五点四。广大劳动人民的生活日益贫困。
    此外，智利大学广大学生反对腐朽的资产阶级教育制度的斗争，仍在坚持着。智利大学的进步教师和附属这个大学的进步研究人员的代表，七日再次公开表示要站在广大学生一边，反对这个学校的反动分子勾结修正主义分子企图破坏大学生罢课斗争的阴谋活动。
