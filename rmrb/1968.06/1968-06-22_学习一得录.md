In the Mao Zedong Thought Study Class

	Notes on Learning
	To understand all social phenomena, one must view them through the lens of class struggle, listen with the ears of class struggle, smell with the nose of class struggle, and think with the mind of class struggle. Only then can one see through the surface and recognize the true nature of the class enemy.

		Political Department, Unit 4618	Peng Qingxin	Song Mingjiang

	If one does not discard the "self" ("私"), one cannot establish the "public" ("公"), nor can one firmly plant the "loyalty" ("忠"). Only by being utterly loyal to Chairman Mao can one develop great wisdom and courage.

		Company Commander, Unit 6802	Lu Jingxiao

    学习一得录
    对一切社会现象，必须用阶级斗争的眼光看，用阶级斗争的耳朵听，用阶级斗争的嗅觉闻，用阶级斗争的头脑想，才能透过假象，认清阶级敌人的本质。
      四六一八部队政治部　彭庆新　宋明江
    “私”字不丢掉，“公”字立不起，“忠”字树不牢。只有对毛主席无限忠心，才能产生大智大勇。
                六八○二部队连长　芦景孝
