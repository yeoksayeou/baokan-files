This music festival began on May 22nd. Three thousand amateur and professional performers from various factories, mines, agricultural cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, schools, and professional art troupes in Tirana participated in the performances. During the festival, they sang with abundant revolutionary passion, praising the Party of Labour of Albania and its great leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha, praising the revolutionary movement of national life and the revolutionization of people's thoughts, and praising the new life of building socialism.

Workers from the Stalin Textile Combine performed the chorus "Ode to the Party," and the Tirana Workers' Chorus performed the grand chorus "The Revolution is Advancing." Workers from the Tirana Ceramics Factory, the "November 17" Handicraft Cooperative, and the street cleaners and greenery workers of the capital also took to the stage, performing new songs and dances they wrote themselves, depicting the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Amateur performers from the suburbs and mountainous rural areas expressed through folk songs and dances the socialist collectivization of agriculture, the struggle against religious superstition and backward customs, and the revolutionary movement to achieve the complete liberation of women. Female members of the "Shengjerdi-Shepar" Agricultural Cooperative sang beautifully about the first anniversary of their cooperative's establishment. Members of the "Albanian Party of Labour Fifth Congress" Agricultural Cooperative in Seman performed items reflecting their struggle, following Comrade Enver Hoxha's teachings, against religious superstition and all backward customs of the exploiting classes.

Students from the Higher Institute of Arts in Tirana recited poems they wrote praising the revolutionary movement.
