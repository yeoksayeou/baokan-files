The reception and letter-handling office of the Bayan County Revolutionary Committee in Heilongjiang Province has, through handling a large number of visits and letters, grasped the new situations, characteristics, and trends of class struggle, providing the Revolutionary Committee with reference materials for guiding class struggle and striking at class enemies. At the same time, they have educated revolutionary masses, raising their awareness of class struggle.

Our report states: Through handling the visits and letters from the people, the reception and letter-handling office of the Bayan County Revolutionary Committee in Heilongjiang Province has strengthened its ties with the masses. Simultaneously, from a large number of visits and letters, they have grasped the new situations, characteristics, and trends of class struggle, providing the Revolutionary Committee with many reference materials for guiding class struggle and striking at class enemies. They have also, through visits and letters, educated revolutionary masses, turning the reception and letter-handling office into a classroom for class struggle and class education.

Raising Awareness of Class and Line Struggle

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle is an objective existence, not subject to the will of individuals." With the establishment of revolutionary committees at various levels, some comrades have developed a "peaceful numbness" in the face of the good situation, relaxing their class vigilance when handling visits and letters. They do not conduct class analysis on some complex issues but deal with them on a case-by-case basis. They mistakenly believe that as long as they warmly receive visitors, handle matters responsibly, do not delay, and meet the legitimate demands of the masses, they have fulfilled their duties as reception staff. In such circumstances, some class enemies use "visits" as a cover to probe for weaknesses; some impersonate "martyrs' families" to ask for help in solving living problems; some use factional struggles to direct their attacks at the newly established revolutionary committees, and so on. Countless facts of class struggle have deeply educated them, making them realize that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more complex and profound the class struggle becomes. They have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on class struggle, summarized the experiences and lessons of their previous work, further raised their awareness of class and line struggle, and decided to handle visits and letters with a class struggle perspective, turning the reception and letter-handling office into a frontline position for class struggle.

Conducting Class Analysis on All Matters

The reception and letter-handling office is a mass work department of the Revolutionary Committee with a wide range of contacts. Every day, they handle a large number of visits and letters, with complex and varied situations: there are a large number of internal contradictions among the people, as well as enemy issues; they need to clarify right and wrong, as well as distinguish between enemies and ourselves. In such circumstances, how to maintain a clear mind and handle visits and letters well with a class struggle perspective is a severe test for every staff member of the reception and letter-handling office. The staff members, with these questions in mind, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on class struggle and related teachings on correctly handling internal contradictions among the people, making them deeply realize: although the reception work is complex, as long as we emphasize Mao Zedong Thought, no matter how complex the problem is, it is not difficult to solve; although two types of contradictions of different natures are intertwined, as long as we use the class and class struggle perspective to analyze, we can clarify right and wrong, distinguish between enemies and ourselves. Over the past year, they have used the method of class analysis to identify 536 cases of class and line struggle, accounting for 30% of the total number of reception and letter-handling cases. For these visits and letters, they have handled them seriously. For the evil activities of class enemies, they have exposed their plots and tricks with one strike, giving them a severe blow. The reception staff also pay attention to grasping the new trends of class struggle from the activities of class enemies and the letters of revolutionary masses exposing and reporting bad people and bad deeds, timely reflecting the situation to the leadership, and providing clues to relevant departments. For the revolutionary actions of revolutionary masses exposing and reporting bad people and bad deeds, they firmly support and encourage the masses to dare to struggle against class enemies.

Turning the Reception Office into a Class Education Classroom

Chairman Mao recently teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism to oppose the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie."

To help visiting masses deeply understand Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction, raise the visiting masses' awareness of class and line struggle, the staff of the reception office actively carried out class education while handling visits from the masses. Their approach is: first, to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on class struggle with the visiting masses. Based on the problems raised by the visiting masses, they guide and help the visiting masses to use the method of class analysis to analyze and understand the problems they raised, and then study the handling methods; second, to criticize China's Khrushchev in an unrestricted form with the visiting masses, eliminate his poison, recall bitterness and sweetness together, and praise Chairman Mao's great achievements together. In this way, they not only help the visiting masses solve their problems but also make the visiting masses receive profound class education, strengthening their deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao. Old Lady Yin, a five-guarantee household from Fumin Production Brigade, Songhuajiang Commune, was deceived and instigated by bad people to come to the county Revolutionary Committee reception office, saying that the county had withheld her subsidy. After the reception office staff immediately understood the true situation from the relevant departments, they studied Chairman Mao's instructions with her, exposed and criticized the crimes of China's Khrushchev, praised the great achievements of Chairman Mao, and helped her raise her awareness. She expressed that she would raise her revolutionary vigilance in the future and not be deceived by bad people again.

    接待来访处理来信不忘阶级斗争
    巴彦县革委会信访接待室从大量的来信来访中，掌握阶级斗争新情况、新特点、新动向，为革委会指导阶级斗争，打击阶级敌人提供了参考材料；同时教育了革命群众，提高了群众的阶级斗争觉悟
    本报讯　黑龙江省巴彦县革命委员会信访接待室，通过接待和处理人民群众的来信来访，加强了同群众的联系，同时从大量的来信来访中，掌握阶级斗争的新情况、新特点、新动向，为革命委员会指导阶级斗争，打击阶级敌人，提供了许多参考材料。他们还通过来信来访，教育革命群众，把信访接待室变成了阶级斗争和阶级教育的课堂。
    提高阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争是客观存在，不依人的意志为转移的。”随着各级革命委员会建立，有些同志在大好形势下产生了“和平麻痹”思想，在接待来访和处理来信时，放松了阶级警惕性，对一些复杂的问题，不作阶级分析，而是就事论事。他们错误地认为只要热情接待，认真负责，不推不拖，满足群众的正当要求，就算尽到了接待人员的责任。在这种情况下，有的阶级敌人借“来访”为名，寻风讨底；有的冒充
  “烈属”要求帮助解决生活问题；有的利用派性斗争，把矛头指向新生的革命委员会，等等。无数阶级斗争事实，深刻地教育了他们，使他们认识到无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是复杂、越是深刻。他们反复学习了毛主席关于阶级斗争的最新指示，总结了前一段工作的经验教训，进一步提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，决心以阶级斗争观点处理来信来访，把信访接待室当成阶级斗争的前哨阵地。
    对于任何事情都要进行阶级分析
    信访接待室是革命委员会的一个群众工作部门，联系面很广。每天都接待大量的来访和处理大量的来信，情况错综复杂：既有大量的人民内部矛盾，又有敌我问题；既要弄清是非，又要分清敌我。在这种情况下，如何保持清醒头脑，以阶级斗争观点做好来信来访的接待和处理工作，是对每个信访工作人员的一个严峻考验。接待室的同志们带着这些问题学习了毛主席关于阶级斗争的最新指示和有关正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的教导，使他们深刻地认识到：尽管信访工作很复杂，只要突出毛泽东思想，再复杂的问题也不难解决；尽管两类不同性质的矛盾交织在一起，只要用阶级和阶级斗争的观点去分析，就能弄清是非，分清敌我。一年来，他们用阶级分析的方法，分析出阶级斗争和路线斗争的案件五百三十六件，占接待信访案件总数的百分之三十。对于这些来信来访，他们都进行了严肃认真的处理。对阶级敌人的罪恶活动，一针见血地揭穿他们的阴谋诡计，给以严厉的打击。接待人员还随时注意从阶级敌人的活动和革命群众揭发检举的信件中，掌握阶级斗争的新动向，及时向领导反映情况，向有关部门提供线索。对于革命群众揭发检举坏人坏事的革命行动，他们则坚决支持，鼓励群众敢于向阶级敌人进行斗争。
    把接待室变成阶级教育的课堂
    毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”
    为了帮助来访群众深刻领会毛主席这一英明指示，提高来访群众阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，接待室的工作人员在接待来访群众的同时，积极地开展了阶级教育。他们的做法，一是和来访群众一起学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的最新指示。针对来访群众提出的问题，启发和帮助来访群众用阶级分析的方法，去分析和认识自己提出的问题，然后再研究处理办法；二是不拘形式地和来访群众一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫，肃清其流毒，一起忆苦思甜，一起颂扬毛主席的丰功伟绩。这样，既帮助来访群众解决了问题，又使来访群众受到了深刻的阶级教育，增强了对伟大领袖毛主席无限深厚的阶级感情。松花江公社福民大队五保户尹老大娘，由于受坏人蒙蔽和唆使，来县革委会接待室说：县里给她的补助费，被大队扣留了。接待室的同志马上向有关部门了解真实情况后，就同她一起学习毛主席指示，揭发批判中国赫鲁晓夫的罪行，颂扬伟大领袖毛主席的丰功伟绩，使她提高了觉悟，她表示以后要提高革命警惕，不再上坏人的当。
