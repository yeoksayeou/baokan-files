Revolutionary enthusiasm comes from where? Worker Wang Chunqi

Chinese Khrushchev has always advocated "material incentives," vigorously promoting the idea of money being the boss, and absurdly claiming: "To unleash the enthusiasm of local, departmental, and enterprise units, there needs to be a bit of freedom, an incentive system. It doesn't have to be product rewards; money can also be used." Listen! This representative of the exploiting class never forgets to use "bonuses" to stimulate the "enthusiasm" of bourgeois individualism, which is utterly shameless!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. Especially during periods of fundamental changes in the socio-economic system, this is the case." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we resolutely take the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, analyze everything, transform everything, and promote everything. This is the fundamental way to run our enterprises well.

Chinese Khrushchev and his agents vigorously push for the "incentive system." They implemented so-called "overproduction bonuses" in our leather cord production team. The daily production quota is set, and for every extra pound of leather cord produced, a pound of "bonus" is given. As a result, the ideological front was occupied by the "self" character. I recalled Chairman Mao's teaching that we should serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly." How could we work for a few dollars in bonuses? It is clear that Chinese Khrushchev is using "bonuses" as bait to push us into the quagmire of bourgeois individualism. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought, this political microscope, helped me see through Chinese Khrushchev's evil intentions in playing with the "incentive system." We firmly proposed, "We want Mao Zedong Thought, not 'bonuses'." Later, they played another trick, changing our team's "overproduction bonus" to a so-called "comprehensive bonus," making the completion of production quality the main condition for the bonus. Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, I again proposed to abolish the "comprehensive bonus." But Chinese Khrushchev's agents said, "This is care for the workers." Pfft! This is opium that corrupts the workers' minds. The more bonuses one gets, the heavier the private thoughts become. I returned every few dollars given to me monthly and the twenty-plus dollars given annually, not taking a single cent. The "bonuses" were returned, but what I gained was a heart fully dedicated to serving the people.

In early 1967, under the influence of the "January Revolution" storm, we responded to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production," insisting on part-time revolution, on-site revolution, and frugal revolution. Sometimes we stayed up all night writing big-character posters, and during the day, we worked as usual. Some misled masses left their production posts, and we took on double the workload, ensuring that Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment would not be disrupted. Our workshop finally overfulfilled the annual production task. Our revolutionary enthusiasm did not come from "bonuses" but from our boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Is it "bonuses" that lead, or politics? This is a major issue in the struggle between two lines. Chinese Khrushchev attempts to use "bonuses" to disrupt the struggle to eliminate private thoughts and establish public-mindedness on the political and ideological front, luring people to pursue personal fame and material enjoyment. This opens the "green light" for bourgeois ideology, making workers forget the party's interests, the people's interests, and class struggle for "bonuses." The result would lead to the restoration of capitalism in China. As a vanguard fighter of the proletariat and a Communist Party member, we must always listen to Chairman Mao's words, "Criticize and repudiate revisionism, fight selfishness and repudiate revisionism," carry out the ideological transformation of the people, and wholeheartedly serve the people.

### 革命积极性从哪里来？

    革命积极性从哪里来？
    工人　王春起
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯鼓吹“物质刺激”，竭力宣扬钞票挂帅，胡说什么：“要发挥地方、部门、企业的积极性，要有点小自由，要有奖励制度，不一定奖产品，奖钱也可以。”听！这个剥削阶级的总代表，念念不忘以“奖金”来刺激资产阶级个人主义的“积极性”，真是无耻至极！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”按照毛主席的教导，坚定地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，分析一切，改造一切，推动一切，这是我们办好企业的根本。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人极力推行“奖励制度”。他们在我们皮线生产小组实行所谓“超产奖”，每天生产有定额，超过一斤皮线就有一斤皮线的“奖金”。结果，思想阵地被“私”字占领了。我想起毛主席教导我们要“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，怎么能为几块“奖金”干活呢？很明显，这是中国赫鲁晓夫以“奖金”作诱饵，把我们往资产阶级个人主义泥坑推。战无不胜的毛泽东思想这个政治上的显微镜，使我看清了中国赫鲁晓夫玩弄“奖励制度”的罪恶目的。我们坚决提出“要毛泽东思想，不要‘奖金’”。以后，他们又玩弄花招，把我们生产小组的“超产奖”改为所谓“综合奖”，把完成生产好坏作为评奖的主要条件。我根据毛主席的教导，再次提出取消“综合奖”的建议。但中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人胡说：“这是对工人的关怀。”呸！这是腐蚀工人阶级心灵的鸦片，奖金得的越多，私心也就越重。我把每月给我评的几块钱，年终评的二十几块钱，一一退了回去，一分一毫也不要。“奖金”退掉了，得到的却是一颗全心全意为人民服务的红心。
    一九六七年初，在“一月革命”风暴的影响下，我们响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，坚持业余闹革命，就地闹革命，节约闹革命。有时通宵写大字报，白天照常上班；有的受蒙蔽群众擅自离开生产岗位，我们就一人顶两人干，决不让毛主席的伟大战略部署受到干扰。我们车间终于超额完成全年的生产任务。我们这种革命积极性，不是靠的什么“奖金”，而是靠的无限忠于毛主席的红心。
    是“奖金”挂帅，还是政治挂帅，这是两条路线斗争的大问题。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图用“奖金”来破坏政治思想战线上破私立公的斗争，引诱人们单纯去追求个人的名利和物质享受，这样就为资产阶级思想大开“绿灯”，使职工为了“奖金”，而忘记党的利益，忘记人民的利益，忘记阶级斗争，其结果会导致资本主义在中国的复辟。作为一个无产阶级先锋战士的共产党员就是要永远听毛主席的话，“斗私，批修”，搞好人的思想革命化，全心全意为人民服务。
