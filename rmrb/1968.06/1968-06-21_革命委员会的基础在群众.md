After I began participating in the leadership work of the factory revolutionary committee, initially, I was still diligent, paying attention to going deep among the masses, understanding the situation, and being vigilant against the sabotage plots of class enemies. As the revolutionary situation developed, the committee became more and more consolidated, and the string of class struggle in my mind gradually loosened. I felt that the situation was stable, that China's Khrushchev and his agents in our factory had been criticized enough, and that even if there were a few hidden counter-revolutionaries, they were like a few flies bumping into walls, buzzing a few times. Therefore, I was not as quick or timely as the revolutionary masses in discovering new problems and new trends in the class struggle.

During a recent period, the main responsible person of the factory revolutionary committee went to the provincial revolutionary committee for a meeting, and I was in charge of the daily work at home. At that time, we responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "streamline administration and reduce personnel," and initially studied and decided on the first step of the streamlining plan. The capitalists and class enemies in the factory thought they had an opportunity, stirring up trouble behind the scenes and inciting some uninformed masses to put pressure on the revolutionary committee. The several comrades who were at home immediately held a meeting to discuss the matter. At the meeting, the representatives of the revolutionary masses used a large amount of facts to explain that all the signs at present indicated: the class enemies were using new methods to launch a new attack on us. We followed Chairman Mao's teachings, went deep among the masses, and together with the broad masses, analyzed and studied the current class struggle situation. At that time, the main danger was that the class enemies were attempting to sabotage our struggle, criticism, and reform from the right, disrupt our various works, and try to overthrow our newly born revolutionary committee. Through the masses' exposure, we criticized and struggled against several representatives who were making a rightist comeback, and smashed the class enemies' sabotage plots.

Afterwards, I thought: Why were the representatives of the revolutionary masses so sensitive to the class struggle situation in the factory, and why were their judgments so accurate? While I was somewhat dull? The main reason is: the representatives of the revolutionary masses have a close relationship with the broad masses. They come from the masses, understand the masses the best, and after joining the revolutionary committee, they still study, work, and live with the masses. The broad masses have nothing to hide from them, and they know the various thoughts and trends of the masses the most, the fastest, and the most accurately. On the contrary, because I had some complacency and laxity in my mind, I found it difficult to discover problems in time and judge the situation accurately. Having found the lesson, I tightened the string of class struggle in my mind again, often went deep among the masses, and used the perspective of class and class struggle to analyze various phenomena.

Through this work, I further realized the important role of the representatives of the revolutionary masses in the revolutionary committee. Because they have close ties with the broad revolutionary masses, they can reflect the opinions of the masses in the most timely and accurate manner, and can make our revolutionary power always under the supervision of the broad revolutionary masses. What is authority? Mastering Mao Zedong Thought and having the broad revolutionary masses genuinely support us is authority; without Mao Zedong Thought and without the masses, there is no authority. The revolutionary masses are the iron wall of our revolutionary committee. As long as we firmly rely on the broad masses, we can always stand unshakable.

    革命委员会的基础在群众
    济南机车工厂革命委员会革命干部代表　徐传孝
    我参加厂革命委员会领导工作以后，开始，自己还是兢兢业业，注意深入群众，了解情况，警惕阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。随着革命形势的发展，革委会一天天的巩固，思想里阶级斗争这根弦也逐渐松弛，觉得大局已定，中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在我厂的代理人已经批得差不多了，就是有几个暗藏的反革命分子，也不过象几只碰壁苍蝇，嗡嗡几声而已。因此，对阶级斗争中出现的新问题、新动向，就不象革命群众发现得那样快，那样及时。
    前一个时期，厂革委会的主要负责人去省革委会开会，由我在家主持日常工作。当时我们响应伟大领袖毛主席“精兵简政”的号召，初步研究决定了第一步精简方案。厂里的走资派及阶级敌人以为有机可乘，在背后煽阴风点邪火，竭力挑拨一些不明真相的群众，向革委会施加压力。在家的几位常委同志立即开会研究。会上革命群众的代表用大量的事实，说明当前的一切迹象表明：阶级敌人采用新的手法对我们发动了新的进攻。我们遵照毛主席的教导，深入群众，和广大群众一起，对当前的阶级斗争形势进行了分析研究，当时的主要危险是阶级敌人企图从右的方面来破坏我们的斗批改，干扰我们的各项工作，妄图颠覆我们的新生的革命委员会。经过群众的揭发，我们批斗了几个闹右倾翻案的代表人物，粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。
    事后，我想：为什么革命群众代表对厂里的阶级斗争形势这样敏感，判断得这样准确？而自己却有些迟钝呢？最主要的原因是：革命群众的代表同广大群众有血肉相联的关系。他们来自群众，对群众最了解，参加革委会以后，仍然同群众一起学习，一起劳动，一起生活，广大群众对他们无话不谈，群众中的各种思想要求和动向，他们了解得最多、最快、最准确。相反地，正因为我思想上有些自满和松懈，就很难及时地发现问题，准确地判断情况。找到了教训，思想上又重新拉紧了阶级斗争这根弦，经常深入群众，用阶级和阶级斗争的观点来分析各种各样的现象。
    通过这段工作，使我进一步认识到革命群众的代表在革命委员会中的重要作用。由于他们同广大革命群众有着密切的联系，就能最及时最准确地反映群众意见，就能使我们的革命政权，永远置于广大革命群众的监督之下。什么叫权威，掌握了毛泽东思想，有广大革命群众真心实意地拥护就是权威；离开了毛泽东思想，脱离了群众也就无所谓权威，革命群众是我们革命委员会的铜墙铁壁，只要我们紧紧地依靠广大群众，我们就能永远立于不败之地。
