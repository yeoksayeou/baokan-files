The great leader Chairman Mao said: "Without a people's army, there is nothing." The proletariat must seize power with the gun, and to consolidate power, they must also rely on the gun. If the proletariat and the working people lose the gun, they will lose everything. The People's Liberation Army is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the steadfast defender of the socialist revolutionary cause. Strengthening and consolidating this army, or weakening and abolishing it, is a fundamental attitude towards the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is the touchstone that distinguishes true revolutionaries from false ones, revolution from counter-revolution. All enemies of the proletariat, who want to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, will inevitably first attempt to undermine and destroy the army, which is the strong pillar.

China's Khrushchev is the sworn enemy of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In order to realize his evil conspiracy to restore capitalism, he has long regarded the People's Liberation Army as a thorn in his side and has been trying every means to sabotage and weaken this army.

In September 1958, our great leader Chairman Mao, based on the serious fact that American imperialism was madly provoking war against our country, issued a call to arms to the nation: "The imperialists are bullying us like this, and this needs to be dealt with seriously. We not only need a powerful regular army, but we must also establish militia regiments." Chairman Mao's great call greatly boosted the morale of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people and struck a heavy blow to the arrogance of imperialists, revisionists, and counter-revolutionaries, as well as all class enemies within the country.

Just two months after this call, in November of the same year, the biggest capitalist-roader within the party, who harbors deep hatred for our army, fearing that our army would further develop and grow stronger, personally rushed from Beijing to the front lines of the coastal defense. Upon arriving on the island, he neither listened to the enthusiastic reports of the front-line soldiers and civilians about establishing militia regiments nor inquired about the tense preparations for war. Instead, he sneaked around, issuing dark "instructions," attempting to demoralize our front-line soldiers and civilians and relax our war preparations. He blatantly opposed Chairman Mao by advocating that the troops lay down their guns and focus on "struggling for fish, meat, and fine grains," openly demanding that the army transform into a comprehensive people's commune that includes industry, agriculture, and fisheries. He also told the front-line soldiers and civilians, who were busy establishing militia regiments, "Can you turn every island into a place like Putuo Mountain," turning the front-line islands into "tourist spots" and "paradise on the sea." This is sheer nonsense!

We clearly remember that just before and after China's Khrushchev crawled onto the island, the gunpowder smell was thick in our southeastern coastal areas, with artillery battles never ceasing and the threat of a major war looming. At that time, the infamous war monger Dulles personally came to the Taiwan Strait to plot an invasion, creating a tense situation; the U.S. Seventh Fleet brazenly entered our territorial waters, brandishing their fangs and claws, threateningly. Our front-line soldiers and civilians, following the teachings of the great commander Chairman Mao, launched a nationwide militia movement while remaining highly vigilant and prepared for battle. It is imaginable that if we had relaxed our vigilance even slightly, it would have given the enemy an opportunity to exploit. China's Khrushchev, coming neither too early nor too late, chose this critical moment to come to our coastal defense front lines, attempting to disarm our front-line soldiers and civilians politically. His intention was clear: he wanted us to surrender to American imperialism, meekly let them in, and hand over the socialist country we had won with blood and sacrifice, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. China's Khrushchev once again exposed his traitorous face. The brave front-line soldiers and civilians, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, saw through him long ago and paid no heed to his tricks. All soldiers and civilians resolutely followed Chairman Mao's instructions, with war preparations becoming better and better, and military-civilian defense becoming more solid. Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, they had already become an iron wall on the sea. China's Khrushchev's master, American imperialism, if they dared to try, would surely be met with a bloody nose and shattered bones.

It must be pointed out that China's Khrushchev's treacherous activities of betraying the people's army and abolishing armed struggle have a long history. As early as the First Civil War, he ordered the Wuhan workers' picket force to hand over thousands of guns to the Kuomintang, opposing the armed seizure of power. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai-shek plotted to monopolize the fruits of victory, shouting for the people to hand over their weapons, attempting to annihilate the Communist Party in one stroke. Our great leader Chairman Mao led the people of the whole country in a struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. Chairman Mao at that time pointed out wisely: "The people's weapons, every gun and every bullet, must be preserved and cannot be handed over." At this critical moment, China's Khrushchev blatantly sat on the same bench as Chiang Kai-shek, demanding that our party lay down its weapons and hand over the army to Chiang Kai-shek, saying nonsense like "stop direct command of the army and unify under the Ministry of Defense (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Defense)." On the eve of national victory, Chairman Mao repeatedly warned us: "The People's Liberation Army will forever be a fighting force" and "must never relax our fighting will." The abundant evidence of the past nineteen years since the founding of the nation has proven that after the proletariat seizes power, during the period when classes have not been eliminated domestically and imperialism still exists in the world, the proletariat and the working people must never relax their grip on the gun. Otherwise, the dictatorship of the proletariat will be overthrown, and the cause of the proletarian revolution will be in vain. It is precisely because our army firmly follows Chairman Mao's teachings, developing and strengthening itself according to the needs of the struggle, that we have effectively defended the socialist homeland and achieved victory after victory in the socialist revolutionary cause. Since the liberation of the nation, China's Khrushchev has been even more brazen in opposing the people's army. He said nonsense like "the enemies have almost been eliminated," "there is no more war," "the experiences of our revolutionary soldiers are now useless," "we have the skills but they are of no use," and demanded that we "go to factories to work" and "learn to do business with capitalists." All these facts eloquently prove that China's Khrushchev is a consistent opponent of the proletariat holding the gun, a traitor to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and a sworn enemy of our people's liberation army and the working people.

"Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." China's Khrushchev, in order to save his lost "paradise" and realize his dream of restoring capitalism, eagerly opposes the proletariat and the working people holding the gun and does everything to sabotage and weaken the great People's Liberation Army. We must therefore hold the gun even tighter, strive to enhance our army's combat effectiveness, and resolutely defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, forever being the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    永作无产阶级专政的坚强柱石
    某海防部队司令员、战斗英雄  张明
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”无产阶级要夺取政权，靠的是枪杆子，要巩固政权，同样要靠枪杆子。无产阶级和劳动人民丧失了枪杆子，就会丧失一切。人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石，是社会主义革命事业的坚强保卫者。巩固和加强这支军队，还是削弱和取消这支军队，这是对待无产阶级专政的根本态度问题，这是区别真革命和假革命、革命和反革命的试金石。一切无产阶级的敌人，他们想颠覆无产阶级专政，就必然首先要动摇和破坏作为坚强柱石的军队。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是无产阶级专政的死对头。他为了实现复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，早就把人民解放军看作是他的眼中钉，千方百计地想着破坏和削弱这支军队。
    一九五八年九月，我们伟大领袖毛主席根据美帝国主义疯狂向我国进行战争挑衅的严重事实，向全国人民发出了战斗号召：“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。我们不但要有强大的正规军，我们还要大办民兵师。”毛主席这一伟大号召，大长了亿万革命人民的志气，大灭了帝、修、反及国内一切阶级敌人的威风。
    就在这年十一月，也就是毛主席发出大办民兵师的伟大号召不到两个月，对我军怀着刻骨仇恨的党内最大的走资派，唯恐我军得到进一步发展和壮大，竟然亲自出马，带着阴谋诡计，匆匆忙忙从北京赶到海防前线。他上得岛来，既不听前线军民当时热火朝天地大办民兵师的情况，也不问问紧张的战备工作，却东溜西窜，大作黑“指示”，妄图涣散我前线军民的士气，松懈我前线的战备工作，明目张胆地和毛主席大唱反调。他别有用心地煽动干部、战士不要搞战备，把精力放到为“吃鱼吃肉吃细粮”而奋斗上，赤裸裸地要求部队放下枪杆，“办成包括工、农、渔业在内的综合性人民公社”。他还对当时正在大办民兵师的前线军民说：“你们能不能把每个岛子都建成象普陀山一样”，使前线海岛都变成“游览胜地”、“海上乐园”。这真是一派胡言！
    我们清楚地记得，就在中国赫鲁晓夫爬上海岛的前后，我国东南沿海火药味正浓，炮战从没有间断，大战也有一触即发之势。当时，臭名远扬的战争贩子杜勒斯，亲自出马，来到台湾海峡，策划侵略战争，制造紧张局势；美国第七舰队公然侵入我国领海，张牙舞爪，虎视眈眈，进行军事挑衅。我前线军民遵照伟大统帅毛主席的教导，一面掀起了全民皆兵的热潮，一面百倍提高警惕，严阵以待，作好了一切战斗准备。可以设想，当时如果稍微放松一下警惕，就会给敌人以可乘之隙。中国赫鲁晓夫早不来，迟不来，偏偏挑中这样的关键时刻，来到我们海防前线，妄图从政治上解除前线军民的武装，目的很清楚，他就是要我们向美帝国主义屈膝投降，乖乖地放他们进来，把流血牺牲换来的社会主义江山拱手交给他们，让无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政。中国赫鲁晓夫又一次暴露了他的叛徒嘴脸。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的英勇的前线军民，早看透了他，根本不理他的那一套。全体军民坚决照毛主席指示办事，战备工作越做越好，军民联防越来越巩固，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，早已成了海上的钢铁长城。中国赫鲁晓夫的主子美帝国主义想来试试，准叫他碰得头破血流，粉身碎骨。
    必须指出，中国赫鲁晓夫叛卖人民军队，取消武装斗争的罪恶活动，是由来已久的。早在第一次国内革命战争时期，他就勒令武汉工人纠察队向国民党交出几千枝枪，反对武装夺取政权。抗日战争胜利后，蒋介石阴谋独吞胜利果实，狂叫要人民交出武装，企图一举消灭共产党。我们伟大领袖毛主席，领导全国人民和国民党反动派进行了针锋相对的斗争。毛主席当时英明地指出：“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”就在这个关键时刻，中国赫鲁晓夫公然和蒋介石坐在一条板凳上，要我党放下武器，把军队交给蒋介石，胡说什么“停止对军队的直接指挥，统一于国防部（指蒋介石的国防部）”。全国胜利前夕，毛主席谆谆告诫我们：“人民解放军永远是一个战斗队”，“绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志”。建国十九年来的大量事实证明，无产阶级在夺取政权以后，在国内没有消灭阶级和世界上还存在着帝国主义的时期内，无产阶级和劳动人民绝不可稍微放松一下枪杆子，否则，无产阶级专政就会遭到颠覆，无产阶级革命事业就会前功尽弃。正是由于我军坚定地遵循毛主席的教导，随着斗争形势的需要，加速发展和壮大自己的力量，才有效地保卫了社会主义江山，使我国社会主义的革命事业取得节节胜利。而中国赫鲁晓夫从全国解放以来，反对人民军队更加变本加厉。他胡说什么“敌人消灭的差不多了”，“不打仗了”，我们革命战士过去“那些经验闲起来了”，“有那个本事可是没有用了”，要我们“到工厂里去做工”，跟资本家“去学做生意”。所有这些事实，都雄辩地说明，中国赫鲁晓夫是一贯反对无产阶级掌握枪杆子的反革命分子，是无产阶级革命事业的大叛徒，是我们人民解放军和劳动人民的不共戴天的死敌。
    “凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”中国赫鲁晓夫为了挽救他失去的“天堂”，实现复辟资本主义的迷梦，起劲地反对无产阶级和劳动人民掌握枪杆子，百般破坏和削弱伟大的人民解放军，我们就越要紧紧掌握枪杆子，努力提高我军的战斗力，誓死捍卫无产阶级专政，永作无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。
