Indian military aircraft have repeatedly violated our airspace to conduct reconnaissance and provocative activities. Our New China News Agency, upon instruction, has issued a serious warning to India regarding its invasion behavior. Our relevant authorities are closely monitoring the military provocations by the Indian reactionaries.

New China News Agency, June 10th: Recently, the Indian reactionary government has continuously dispatched nine sorties of military aircraft into the airspace over our Tibet Autonomous Region's Yadong area, conducting reconnaissance and provocative activities. Our agency, upon instruction, issues a serious warning to the Indian aircraft for this invasion behavior!

On May 28th, two Indian aircraft sorties, at 8:50 AM and 9:15 AM respectively, intruded into our territory from the Kuka Long mountain pass on the China-Sikkim border, penetrating 25 kilometers deep. On May 31st, at 7:45 AM, one Indian aircraft intruded from the Nikanla mountain pass, penetrating 40 kilometers deep, and conducted reconnaissance while circling over the Qula and Duila areas. On the same day, at 1:10 PM, another Indian aircraft intruded from the Nikanla mountain pass, penetrating 10 kilometers deep into our territory. On June 1st, at 10:27 AM, one Indian aircraft intruded from the Chula mountain pass, penetrating 15 kilometers deep. On June 2nd, at 7:30 AM, one Indian aircraft intruded from the Kuka Long mountain pass, penetrating 6 kilometers deep. On June 4th, at 2:04 PM, one Indian aircraft intruded from the Naidula mountain pass, conducting reconnaissance and provocations in our Yadong area and the regions north of it. On the same day, at 6:38 PM, another Indian aircraft intruded 2 kilometers deep from the area north of the Chula mountain pass; at 6:49 PM, another Indian aircraft intruded from the Tangala mountain pass, penetrating 11 kilometers deep, and conducted reconnaissance while circling.

The Indian reactionaries, who have aligned themselves with American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique, have recently dispatched military aircraft into Chinese territory with such frequency to conduct military provocations. They are deliberately creating tension on the China-Sikkim border and actively collaborating with the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionist clique in their joint anti-China efforts. Our relevant authorities are closely monitoring this situation.

    新华社十日讯  最近，印度反动政府，连续派遣军用飞机九架次侵入我国西藏亚东地区上空，进行侦察挑衅活动。我社奉命对印度飞机这种入侵行为，提出严重警告！
    五月二十八日，印机两架次，分别于八时五十分和九时十五分，由中国锡金边界屈卡龙山口侵入我境，深达二十五公里。五月三十一日七时四十五分，印机一架由聂康拉山口入侵我境，深达四十公里，在穷拉、堆拉地区上空盘旋侦察。同日，十三时十分，印机又一架，也由聂康拉山口入侵，深入我境十公里。六月一日十时二十七分，印机一架由楚拉山口入侵，深入我境十五公里。六月二日七时三十分，印机一架由屈卡龙山口入侵，深入我境六公里。六月四日十四时零四分，印机一架，由乃堆拉山口入侵，侵入我亚东及其以北地区，进行侦察挑衅。同日，十八时三十八分，印机又一架，由楚拉山口以北侵入我境两公里；十八时四十九分，印机又一架，由唐嘎拉山口侵入我境，深达十一公里，进行盘旋侦察。
    投靠美帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团的印度反动派，近来如此频繁地派遣军用飞机侵入中国领土上空进行军事挑衅，蓄意在中锡边境制造紧张局势，积极配合美帝和苏修叛徒集团联合反华，我有关方面正密切注视中。（附图片）
