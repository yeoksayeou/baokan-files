President Julius K. Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania and his wife held a grand farewell banquet at the Great Hall of the People this evening.

Invited to the banquet were leaders from various sectors of the Party and the state, including Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, Xie Fuzhi, Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, and Wang Dongxing.

Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian of the State Council, and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, were also invited to the banquet.

This evening, the national flags of Tanzania and China were displayed on the stage of the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People. President Nyerere and Premier Zhou Enlai both spoke at the banquet, wishing the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania to grow stronger day by day.

President Nyerere said, "The friendship between China and Tanzania is based on the principles of respect and equality. We do not interfere in each other's internal affairs. We cherish this friendship. No foreign country can interfere with it. I have no reason to believe that the friendship between Tanzania and China will not last forever and grow stronger day by day."

He said, "Tanzania opposes the Non-Proliferation Treaty. We believe this is a very unequal treaty. This treaty requires non-nuclear states, including those with nuclear potential, to give up the right to manufacture and possess nuclear weapons, but it does not require nuclear powers to stop producing any nuclear weapons; it does not require nuclear powers to destroy the nuclear weapons they already have. Worst of all, it does not require nuclear powers to guarantee that they will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against states that agree to sign the treaty."

President Nyerere said, "In Africa, we are fighting against neocolonialism, and at the same time, we are fighting against foreign occupation and racism, where a minority oppresses the majority. We are determined to eradicate imperialism from Africa, and we will not compromise on this. Currently, the people of Africa have taken up arms in Mozambique, Angola, Portuguese Guinea, and Rhodesia. The fighters in these places will surely win in the end."

President Nyerere said, "During my first visit, I saw with my own eyes the revolutionary spirit of your people. Today, after the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people are even more spirited. The Chinese people have a great faith. You believe in the creative power of the people, in your great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, in self-reliance and self-criticism, and in the belief that all oppressed peoples of the world are one family. This is a tremendous spiritual force. Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, you will surely go from victory to victory."

Premier Zhou Enlai said, "President Nyerere's visit to China has been very successful. During the visit, Chairman Mao Zedong and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao had cordial talks with President Nyerere. We have sincerely and friendly exchanged views on the development of friendly cooperation between the two countries and on international issues of common concern. All this will undoubtedly further enhance our mutual understanding, strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries, and thus contribute to the common cause of unity and anti-imperialism among the peoples of Asia and Africa."

Premier Zhou Enlai said, "President Nyerere has given a very high evaluation of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and has highly praised the revolutionary spirit of our people. This is a great support and encouragement to the Chinese people. Currently, we are, according to the teachings of Chairman Mao, firmly relying on the broad masses of the people to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We are deeply convinced that carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country to the end is also in the fundamental interests of all revolutionary peoples in the world. We must unite with all anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist people in the world and fight to the end against American imperialism and its lackeys and running dogs."

Premier Zhou Enlai said, "The friendly cooperation between China and Tanzania is based on anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism and on safeguarding national independence. We both oppose nuclear blackmail, nuclear monopoly, and so-called nuclear protection, and we both firmly support the liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In our mutual relations, we both adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, oppose great-power chauvinism. In struggle, we support each other. In construction, we help each other. At any time, we treat each other as equals, respect each other, and never interfere in each other's internal affairs or impose on each other. Our friendship is not afraid of any enemy's provocation and has a broad prospect for development."

Also invited to the banquet were Vice Minister of National Defense Su Yu, Vice Chief of Staff of the People's Liberation Army Wen Yucheng, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Guanhua, and others.

Leaders of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Wu De and Ding Guoyi, leaders of revolutionary mass organizations in Beijing, active soldiers of the People's Liberation Army studying Chairman Mao's works, and Chinese technical personnel who had previously assisted Tanzania in construction, were also invited to the banquet.

President Nyerere's entourage, Tanzanian Ambassador to China Mwaluko and diplomatic staff of the embassy, performers of the Tanzanian Acrobatic Study Team, and other Tanzanian friends in Beijing, attended the banquet.

Envoys from various countries to China were also invited to the banquet.

After the banquet, a cultural performance was held. Performers from the Tanzanian Acrobatic Study Team presented wonderful acrobatic performances, which were warmly received. (Photo attached)

    尼雷尔总统举行盛大告别宴会
    尼雷尔总统和周恩来总理在宴会上先后讲话，共祝中国和坦桑尼亚两国人民的战斗友谊与日俱增
    新华社二十一日讯　坦桑尼亚联合共和国总统朱利叶斯·克·尼雷尔和夫人，今天晚间在人民大会堂举行盛大告别宴会。
    应邀出席宴会的，有党和国家各方面的负责人周恩来，陈伯达，康生，李富春，张春桥，姚文元，谢富治，黄永胜，吴法宪，汪东兴等同志。
    国务院副总理陈毅、李先念，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若等同志，也应邀出席了宴会。
    今晚，人民大会堂宴会厅主席台上悬挂着坦桑尼亚、中国两国国旗。尼雷尔总统和周恩来总理在宴会上先后讲话，共祝中国和坦桑尼亚两国人民的战斗友谊与日俱增。
    尼雷尔总统说，中国和坦桑尼亚之间的友谊是建立在尊重和平等的原则之上的。我们互不干涉内政。我们珍视这种友谊。任何外国都不能干预它。我没有理由相信，坦桑尼亚和中国之间的友谊不会永存和与日俱增。
    他说，坦桑尼亚反对防止核扩散条约。我们认为，这是一个极不平等的条约。这个条约要求包括有核潜力的国家在内的无核国家放弃制造和拥有核武器的权利，但它并不要求核大国自己停止再制造任何核武器；它不要求核大国销毁他们已有的核武器。而最糟的是，它不要求核大国保证不对同意签署该条约的国家使用或威胁使用核武器。
    尼雷尔总统说，在非洲，我们要进行反对新殖民主义的斗争，同时还要进行反对外国占领和反对种族主义的少数人压迫的斗争。我们决心从非洲铲除帝国主义，对此我们决不妥协。目前，非洲人民已经在莫三鼻给、安哥拉、葡属几内亚和罗得西亚拿起了武器。这些地方的战士们迟早要赢得胜利。
    尼雷尔总统说，在我第一次来访时，我亲眼看到了你们人民的革命精神。今天，经过了文化革命，中国人民更加意气风发。中国人民有着伟大的信仰。你们相信人民的创造力，信仰你们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席，相信自力更生和自我批评的精神，相信全世界被压迫人民是一家人。这是一种巨大的精神力量。在伟大领袖毛泽东主席的指导下，你们一定会从胜利走向胜利。
    周恩来总理说，尼雷尔总统这次访问中国是很成功的。在访问期间，毛泽东主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席同尼雷尔总统进行了亲切的交谈。我们双方就发展两国友好合作关系和共同关心的国际问题，诚挚友好地交换了意见。所有这一切，无疑地会进一步增进我们相互之间的了解，加强两国之间的友好合作，从而对加强亚非人民团结反帝的共同事业作出贡献。
    周恩来总理说，尼雷尔总统对中国的无产阶级文化大革命作了很高的评价，对我国人民的革命精神作了高度的赞扬。这是对于中国人民的巨大支持和鼓舞。目前，我们正在根据毛主席的教导，坚决依靠广大人民群众，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。我们深信，把我国的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，也是符合全世界一切革命人民的根本利益的。我们一定要联合世界上一切反帝反殖的人们，把反对美帝国主义及其帮凶、走狗的斗争进行到底。
    周恩来总理说，中国和坦桑尼亚两国友好合作关系是建立在反帝反殖和维护民族独立的基础之上的。我们都反对核讹诈、核垄断和所谓核保护，反对核殖民主义。我们都坚决支持亚非拉人民的解放斗争。在我们的相互关系中，我们都遵循和平共处五项原则，反对大国沙文主义。在斗争中，我们互相支持。在建设中，我们互相帮助。在任何时候，我们都平等相待，互相尊重，从不干涉内政，从不强加于人。我们的这种友谊是不怕任何敌人挑拨的，是有广阔发展前途的。
    应邀出席宴会的还有，国防部副部长粟裕，中国人民解放军副总参谋长温玉成，外交部副部长姬鹏飞等同志。
    北京市革命委员会负责人吴德、丁国钰，北京市革命群众组织的负责成员，中国人民解放军学习毛主席著作积极分子，以及曾经帮助坦桑尼亚进行建设的我国技术工作人员，也应邀出席了宴会。
    尼雷尔总统的随行人员，坦桑尼亚驻中国大使姆瓦卢科和使馆外交官员，坦桑尼亚杂技学习团演员以及在北京的其他坦桑尼亚朋友，出席了宴会。
    各国驻中国使节也应邀出席了宴会。
    宴会结束后举行了文艺晚会。坦桑尼亚杂技学习团演员在晚会上表演了精采的杂技节目，受到了热烈欢迎。（附图片）
