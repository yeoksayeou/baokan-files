The revolutionary production leadership group of the Component Workshop of the Wuxi Pump and Nozzle Factory has actively led all the revolutionary workers in the workshop to deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism. They have turned the work teams into revolutionary criticism combat teams and the workshop into a broad battlefield for revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary workers widely participate in the criticism, receiving vivid education on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Everyone says that class-based criticism is excellent. The more we criticize, the higher our class consciousness; the more we criticize, the more we hate class enemies and the closer we become to class brothers, and the more loyal we are to Chairman Mao. The deeper the class-based criticism goes, the less room class enemies have to escape; the more persistent the class-based criticism is, the higher the production tide will rise.

Currently, the Component Workshop is in a vibrant revolutionary and production scene. In April, they completed their production tasks five and a half days ahead of schedule, and in May, they completed the equivalent of a full month's production in just eighteen days. The teams that have done the best in class-based criticism, such as the Nozzle Sleeve Team, have created the highest daily output since the factory was established.

Recently, the Wuxi Pump and Nozzle Factory Revolutionary Committee has promoted the experience of the Component Workshop in deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism based on work teams, making the revolutionary criticism throughout the entire factory more vigorous and solid.

The main experiences of the Component Workshop in deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism are as follows:

1. **Loyalty to the Great Leader Chairman Mao, Keeping the Fire of Revolutionary Criticism Burning Bright**

   For a period, some revolutionary workers in the Component Workshop thought that production was busy and their own cultural level was low, so they would stop and start the revolutionary criticism. The workshop leadership group addressed this situation by organizing discussions on the significance of carrying out revolutionary criticism in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Through study and discussion, everyone realized that whether or not to seriously carry out revolutionary criticism is a matter of whether to respond to Chairman Mao's call to "criticize the bourgeoisie." It is a matter of whether to be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, whether to be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and whether to be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao is shown through actions. Loyalty to Chairman Mao means daring to criticize the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, daring to criticize all actions and words against Mao Zedong Thought. If one does not hate, criticize, and struggle against these things, it is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. Some revolutionary workers shared their personal experiences of participating in revolutionary criticism: "Having a 'loyal' heart towards Chairman Mao is the greatest fighting spirit for carrying out revolutionary criticism; revolutionary criticism is a furnace for tempering loyalty to Chairman Mao."

   The workshop revolutionary production leadership group also organized revolutionary workers to recall and compare past experiences and to discuss current class struggle facts, making everyone realize that deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism is a major issue related to preventing people from becoming revisionists, the party from becoming revisionist, and the country from changing color. It is a major issue related to following Chairman Mao in revolution forever. Some old workers said, "We may not have much education, but we have hatred for class enemies in our hearts. We can criticize the bourgeoisie with our mouths!" To help everyone raise their awareness, the leadership group organized a campaign to criticize the traitors and capitalist roaders in the factory and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the workshop, fiercely criticizing the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" advocated by Liu Shaoqi. Through this criticism, many revolutionary workers deeply felt that without revolutionary criticism, the line struggle would not be clear, class consciousness would not be raised, and the proletarian state would not be secure.

   After recognizing that carrying out revolutionary criticism is a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the revolutionary workers of the Component Workshop actively carried out revolutionary criticism based on work teams, making the fire of revolutionary criticism burn brighter. Now, all nineteen teams in the workshop have set up revolutionary criticism columns. More than five hundred revolutionary workers in the workshop universally and frequently participate in various forms of revolutionary criticism activities. Some workers with low cultural levels ask young workers to write criticism articles for them, and some even ask family members and children to help after going home. Some female workers have changed from being busy with housework to being busy preparing for revolutionary criticism. The class-based criticism meetings in the entire workshop are held in a lively atmosphere.

2. **Grasp the Key, Set Examples, and Open Up Revolutionary Criticism Battlefields Everywhere**

   After the masses were fully mobilized, "if there is only the enthusiasm of the masses without a strong leadership cadre to properly organize the enthusiasm of the masses, then the enthusiasm of the masses will neither be sustained nor be able to move in the correct direction and reach a higher level." The revolutionary production leadership group of the Component Workshop followed Chairman Mao's teaching, paying great attention to cultivating the core forces in revolutionary criticism and strengthening the leadership of class-based criticism in work teams. They specially organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes for the core forces of revolutionary criticism, studying Chairman Mao's statements on class struggle under socialist conditions, raising awareness of the great significance of revolutionary criticism, and discussing methods for deeply and persistently carrying out class-based criticism in work teams. Currently, the Component Workshop has formed a vigorous, combat-ready, and people-oriented core force for carrying out revolutionary criticism. In addition to actively engaging in criticism themselves, these core forces also organize old workers with low cultural levels and young workers with higher cultural levels to participate in revolutionary criticism. With such a core force, the revolutionary criticism throughout the entire workshop quickly formed a vigorous and lively situation of taking the initiative to attack and setting up battlefields everywhere.

   The leadership group of the Component Workshop also paid attention to promoting the entire workshop's class-based criticism by grasping typical examples and setting models. The Pump Core Team used to focus solely on production, but production did not improve. Later, the core forces of the team investigated and found a saboteur who had once ruined more than eighteen thousand pump cores at a time. This person often spread rumors and advocated the "material incentives" and other revisionist goods promoted by Liu Shaoqi. The team combined the struggle against this bad element with the criticism of Liu Shaoqi's "material incentives" and other reactionary fallacies, greatly raising everyone's class struggle awareness, treating production as a political battle, and quickly changing the face of backward production. The workshop leadership group promoted this typical example throughout the workshop, educating many workers who used to focus solely on production. The workshop leadership group, with the help of the factory revolutionary committee, summarized and promoted the experiences of the best teams in the workshop for carrying out class-based criticism, such as the Nozzle Sleeve Team and the Nozzle Core Team. Thus, with a core force and living examples and experiences, the entire workshop quickly became a broad battlefield for revolutionary criticism.

3. **Carry Out Four Combinations to Fight a Persistent Battle of Revolutionary Criticism**

   How can class-based criticism in work teams be carried out deeply and persistently? The Component Workshop grasped four combinations, changing the past practice of criticizing intermittently. The more the revolutionary workers criticize, the more enthusiastic they become, and the more they criticize, the more motivated they are.

   The four combinations are:

   - **Combine with the current new situation of class struggle.** In the previous period, a rightist reversal wind blew through society. A small handful of class enemies in the factory also stirred, attempting to reverse their cases. Revolutionary workers combined the new situation of class struggle, studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "all reactionary things, if you do not hit them, they will not fall," and fiercely criticized the rightist reversal wind. Because they firmly grasped the new situation of class struggle, revolutionary criticism became more profound and solid. Revolutionary workers said: Combining revolutionary criticism with the new situation of class struggle makes one see the situation more clearly and have the initiative in class struggle.

   - **Combine with the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought.** Revolutionary workers in the Component Workshop deeply realized in the revolutionary criticism that only by striving to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought can one grasp the sharp weapon for carrying out revolutionary criticism. In the previous period, the revolutionary workers in this workshop, while attending Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, closely combined them with the actual class struggle in the factory, and carried out revolutionary criticism. Through learning and criticizing, revolutionary workers deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in essence, is a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They further realized that revolutionary criticism is the main form of struggle for the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. Workers in the criticism combined problems with the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out criticism. In this way, they learned deeply and criticized thoroughly.

   - **Combine with the purification of class ranks.** Various teams in the Component Workshop, while carrying out revolutionary criticism, always paid attention to combining it with the purification of class ranks. They used the exposed remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries as living examples to fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents' "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the revisionist line of surrender and capitulation, better raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers.

   - **Combine with central tasks.** Various teams in the Component Workshop, while completing various central tasks, always carried out revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's revisionist enterprise management line, effectively promoting the thought revolutionization of people, and promoting the smooth progress of various central tasks. Revolutionary workers reflected that this way of doing things is visible, tangible, and easy to see results.

   Because they grasped the "four combinations," the class-based criticism in the Component Workshop not only achieved breadth and persistence but also became more profound, effectively promoting class struggle, promoting the thought revolutionization of revolutionary workers, making the atmosphere of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire workshop thicker, and making the production situation change day by day.

    把车间变成革命大批判的战场
    无锡油泵油嘴厂偶件车间以班组为基点深入持久开展革命大批判取得经验
    新华社南京二十六日电　无锡油泵油嘴厂偶件车间革命生产领导小组，积极率领全车间的革命职工深入持久开展革命大批判，把班组变成了革命大批判的战斗小组，把车间变成了革命大批判的广阔战场。革命职工广泛参加大批判，在革命大批判中受到了活生生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争教育。大家说，人人都参加的班组大批判就是好。越批，阶级觉悟越提高；越批，对阶级敌人越恨，对阶级兄弟越亲，对毛主席越忠。班组大批判深入搞，阶级敌人无处逃；班组大批判持久搞，生产热潮一浪更比一浪高。
    目前，偶件车间的革命和生产景象一片火红。四月份提前五天半完成了生产任务，五月份仅以十八天时间就完成了相当于四月份全月的生产任务。班组大批判搞得最好的嘴套小组各道工序，日产量都创造了建厂以来的最高水平。
    最近，无锡油泵油嘴厂革委会推广了偶件车间以班组为基点深入持久开展革命大批判的经验，使全厂的革命大批判搞得更加轰轰烈烈，扎扎实实。
    偶件车间深入持久地开展革命大批判的主要经验有三条：
    对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，把革命大批判的烈火烧得旺旺的
    有一段时间，偶件车间有些革命职工认为生产忙，自己文化水平低，对革命大批判就搞搞停停。车间领导小组针对这种情况，就在毛泽东思想学习班里组织大家讨论开展革命大批判的意义。通过学习讨论，大家认识到，是否认真开展革命大批判，是是否响应毛主席关于“批判资产阶级”伟大号召的问题，是是否忠于伟大领袖毛主席，是否忠于毛泽东思想，是否忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的问题。对伟大领袖毛主席忠不忠，要看行动。忠于毛主席，就要勇于批判资产阶级和一切剥削阶级，勇于批判一切反毛泽东思想的言行。对这些东西，如果不仇恨，不批判，不斗争，就是对毛主席的最大不忠。有的革命职工用自己参加革命大批判的切身体会说：“对毛主席心怀一个
  ‘忠’字，是搞好革命大批判的最大战斗力；革命大批判，又是锤炼对毛主席的忠心的熔炉。”
    车间革命生产领导小组还组织革命职工进行回忆对比和大摆当前的阶级斗争事实，使大家认识到：深入持久地开展革命大批判，是关系到人不变修、党不变质、国不变色的大事，是关系到永远紧跟毛主席闹革命的大事。有些老工人说：“我们没有文化，但我们心里有对阶级敌人的仇恨，我们用嘴讲也能批判资产阶级！”为了帮助大家提高认识，领导小组发动大家结合批判本厂的叛徒、走资派和本车间的国民党反动派残渣余孽，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。通过这次大批判，许多革命职工深有体会地说：革命大批判不搞，路线斗争不明了，阶级觉悟提不高，无产阶级的江山保不牢。
    偶件车间革命职工把搞不搞大批判提到忠不忠于毛主席、忠不忠于毛泽东思想、忠不忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的高度来认识以后，就以班组为单位广泛开展革命大批判，把革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺。现在，全车间十九个小组，每个小组都办起了大批判专栏。全车间五百多个革命职工，普遍地、经常地参加了各种不同形式的大批判活动。有些工人文化低，就请青年工人代笔写大批判文章，有的回家后还请亲属、孩子代笔。有些女工，也由过去的忙于家务变成忙于做开展大批判的准备工作。全车间的班组批判会，搞得热火朝天。
    抓骨干，树样板，处处开辟革命大批判战场
    群众充分发动起来后，“如果只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和提到高级的程度。”偶件车间革命生产领导小组遵循毛主席的这一教导，十分注意在革命大批判中培养骨干力量，加强对班组革命大批判的领导。他们专门为大批判骨干队伍举办了毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席关于社会主义条件下的阶级斗争的论述，提高对革命大批判重大意义的认识，讨论深入持久地开展班组革命大批判的方法。目前，偶件车间已经形成了一支朝气蓬勃，富有战斗力，善于密切联系群众的开展革命大批判的骨干队伍。这些骨干力量，除了自己积极搞大批判外，还组织文化低的老工人和有文化的青年工人相结合，带动大家参加革命大批判。有了这样一支骨干队伍，全车间的革命大批判就很快形成了主动出击，处处摆下战场的轰轰烈烈的局面。
    偶件车间领导小组还注意通过抓典型、树样板来推动全车间的班组大批判。泵芯小组过去天天抓生产，可是生产还是上不去。后来，这个小组的大批判骨干，带着生产上的问题进行了调查研究，结果挖出了一个破坏生产的坏分子。这个坏家伙有一次一下子就报废了一万八千多只泵芯。他还经常说鬼话，宣扬中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货。这个小组把斗争这个坏家伙和批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“物质刺激”等反动谬论结合起来，大大提高了大家的阶级斗争觉悟，把生产仗当作政治仗来打，迅速改变了生产落后的面貌。车间领导小组抓住这个典型在全车间进行宣传，使一些以前只顾埋头搞生产的工人受到了很大的教育。车间领导小组还在厂革委会的帮助下，总结推广了全车间开展班组革命大批判最好的嘴套小组和嘴芯小组的经验。这样，既有一支骨干队伍，又有活样板、活经验，整个车间很快就变成了一个革命大批判的广阔战场。
  搞好四个结合，打好革命大批判的持久战
    班组革命大批判怎样才能深入持久地开展下去？偶件车间抓住了四个结合，改变了过去时批时停的现象，革命职工越批斗志越旺，越批干劲越足。
    四个结合是：
    结合当前阶级斗争新形势。前一时期，社会上刮起了一股右倾翻案妖风。厂里的一小撮阶级敌人也蠢蠢欲动，妄图为自己翻案。革命职工就结合阶级斗争的新形势，学习了毛主席关于“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒”的教导，狠批了右倾翻案妖风。由于紧紧掌握了阶级斗争的新形势，革命大批判越搞越深入，越搞越扎实。革命职工说：结合阶级斗争新形势搞大批判，越批对形势看得越清，越批在阶级斗争中越有主动权。
    结合活学活用毛泽东思想。偶件车间的革命职工在革命大批判中深刻认识到：只有努力活学活用毛泽东思想，才能掌握开展革命大批判的锐利武器。前一时期，这个车间的革命职工在毛泽东思想学习班上，就边学习毛主席最新指示，边密切联系厂里的阶级斗争实际，开展革命的大批判。通过边学习，边批斗，革命职工加深理解了毛主席的“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”这一最新指示，并且进一步认识到：革命大批判就是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的主要斗争形式。工人们在大批判中带着问题活学活用毛泽东思想，又以毛泽东思想为武器进行大批判，这样，就学得深，批得透。
    结合清理阶级队伍。偶件车间各班组在开展革命大批判的时候，随时注意同清理阶级队伍结合起来。他们把挖出来的国民党反动派残渣余孽作为活生生的事例，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和招降纳叛的反革命修正主义路线，更好地提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    结合中心工作。偶件车间各班组在完成各项中心工作的时候，始终贯穿着革命的大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义企业管理路线，从而有效地促进了人的思想革命化，促进了各项中心工作的顺利进行。革命职工反映，这样搞，看得见，摸得着，容易见实效。
    由于抓住“四个结合”，偶件车间的班组大批判就不但做到了广泛、持久，而且越来越深入，有效地推动了阶级斗争，促进了革命职工的思想革命化，全车间活学活用毛泽东思想的空气越来越浓厚，生产面貌日新月异。
