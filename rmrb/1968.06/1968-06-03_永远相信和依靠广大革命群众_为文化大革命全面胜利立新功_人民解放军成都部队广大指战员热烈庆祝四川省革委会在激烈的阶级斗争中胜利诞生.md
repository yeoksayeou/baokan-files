The broad cadres and soldiers of the Chengdu Military Region of the People's Liberation Army enthusiastically celebrate the birth of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee amidst the fierce class struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 2 — The broad cadres and soldiers of the Chengdu Military Region of the People's Liberation Army enthusiastically celebrate the birth of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee amidst the fierce class struggle, jubilantly hailing the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The cadres and soldiers vow to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, advance with the momentum of victory, launch fierce attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, and strike all class enemies steadily, accurately, and fiercely to make new contributions to the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

The great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, recently pointed out: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." Chairman Mao's latest instruction has greatly inspired the broad cadres and soldiers of the Chengdu Military Region. They expressed that in the struggle to achieve the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, they must repeatedly study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest instruction, build on achievements, overcome shortcomings, always believe in and rely on the broad revolutionary masses, respect the initiative of the masses, fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.

After hearing Chairman Mao's latest instruction, Zhou Hanliang, the platoon leader of the Yi Ethnic Minority Team of a certain unit's Sixth Platoon, said excitedly, "Over the past two years, the practice of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has proven: where Chairman Mao's instructions are followed, the masses are trusted, relied upon, mobilized, and cherished, there the revolution is carried out vigorously and production is booming. We deeply feel that only by following Chairman Mao's teachings, cherishing, trusting, and relying on the masses, can we do a good job in the 'three supports, two militaries' work, and complete the great tasks entrusted to us by the great leader Chairman Mao." The broad cadres and soldiers expressed that they would repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instruction, deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest instruction, and implement it in action, better implement Chairman Mao's teachings of "supporting the army and loving the people," and do an even better job in the 'three supports, two militaries' work.

In recent days, during the celebration of the birth of the Revolutionary Committee, from the headquarters to the platoons, from the high mountain outposts to the 'three supports, two militaries' front lines, the broad cadres and soldiers joyfully hail the birth of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee as a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The cadres and soldiers responsible for the 'three supports, two militaries' tasks, bringing the news of victory, rushed to factories and villages to report the good news to revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the broad revolutionary masses, and held celebration meetings with them. They sang "The East Is Red" and "Navigating the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" thousands of times, and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" thousands of times.

The broad cadres and soldiers unanimously pointed out: this victory was hard-won, a glorious result of the struggle between the 70 million people of Sichuan, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and bravely fighting against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Sichuan. It marks the beginning of a new historical stage in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Sichuan.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost, but must be defended by struggle." The broad cadres and soldiers unanimously expressed: they must resolutely support, warmly care for, and actively support the Revolutionary Committee, and defend it with their lives. The active member of studying Chairman Mao's works, Pak Gui-han, who stands guard for the Revolutionary Committee, vowed to defend the Revolutionary Committee with his blood and life. The cadres and soldiers of a certain unit in Chongqing, who had won merits in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, expressed: if the class enemies dare to attempt to overthrow the newly born Revolutionary Committee, we will fight to the end with the same fighting spirit we used to defeat the U.S. imperialists on the Korean battlefield. The comrades of the Self-Defense Department of Zigong, the "red flag" of supporting the left, pointed out: the birth of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee is not the end of class struggle, but the starting point of a new battle. We must timely understand the new trends and characteristics of class struggle, resolutely smash the class enemies' attempts to reverse the verdict, and strike the class enemies steadily, accurately, and fiercely to defend the Revolutionary Committee. The garrison troops in Chengdu, Chongqing, Duku, and Dazhu are determined to defend the newly born Revolutionary Committee with a fighting posture and use revolutionary criticism to consolidate and develop it. The broad cadres and soldiers remember Chairman Mao's teachings of "not living on past merits, but making new contributions," learn from Comrade Tan's actions, "think of everything for Chairman Mao, obey everything for Chairman Mao, follow everything for Chairman Mao, and do everything for Chairman Mao," and vow to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with their lives, making new contributions to the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

On May 31, 500,000 revolutionary masses from various fronts in Sichuan, revolutionary cadres, and cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army held a grand meeting to celebrate the birth of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

    广大指战员一致指出：这个胜利来之不易，是四川七千万人民在毛泽东思想光辉指引下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其在四川的代理人英勇奋战的辉煌战果。它标志着四川无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个崭新的历史阶段。
    毛主席教导我们：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”广大指战员一致表示：对革命委员会要坚决拥护，热情关怀，积极支持，誓死捍卫。为四川省革命委员会站第一班岗的某部学习毛主席著作积极分子朴贵贤表示决心用鲜血和生命来捍卫革命委员会。曾经在抗美援朝战争中立过功勋的重庆驻军某部指战员表示：如果阶级敌人妄想颠覆新生的革命委员会，我们就要用当年在朝鲜战场上痛打美帝国主义的战斗精神和他拚到底。支左红旗——自贡市武装部的同志指出：省革命委员会的诞生，并不是阶级斗争的结束，而是新的战斗的起点。必须及时了解阶级斗争的新动向、新特点，坚决粉碎阶级敌人的翻案妖风，又稳、又准、又狠地打击阶级敌人，保卫革命委员会。成都、重庆、渡口、大足等地驻军决心以战斗的姿态，用革命大批判来巩固和发展新生的革命委员会。广大指战员牢记毛主席“不要吃老本，要立新功”的教导，以实际行动向门合同志学习，“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席”，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。（附图片）
