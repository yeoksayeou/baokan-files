Title: The Busier, the More Important It Is to Grasp Living Thoughts

The reactionary fallacy of "production first" peddled by the Chinese Khrushchev often finds a ready market during peak production seasons. For instance, some of our comrades during the busy season slacken off on ideological work, focusing only on the hoe and neglecting the "heads" of the people, thereby falling into the trap of the "production first" theory.

This spring, during the busy planting season, three work teams in our production brigade planted corn together. Some teams insisted on studying at the fieldside, vigorously addressing the living thoughts that arise during labor, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to solve their ideological problems. As a result, they completed their tasks quickly and well. Other teams, however, slackened off on political and ideological work, frantically rushing to meet the pace, resulting in more ideological problems the faster they rushed. Many places had substandard agricultural work. Recently, the leadership required us to complete cotton sowing in five days while ensuring quality. I thought that with only five days, over a hundred acres of cotton fields, and labor power being very tight, and with several preparatory tasks such as green manure, plowing, fertilizing, soaking seeds in warm water, and leveling the land not yet completed, we should, according to Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on the "four firsts," set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the fields. We organized the militia and commune members to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "grain must be grasped, cotton must be grasped, and cloth must be grasped" repeatedly. Everyone decided to sow cotton with the spirit of "Moving Mountains with Persistence." Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the human factor was fully mobilized. Everyone was full of enthusiasm, working while singing the song "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory." As a result, in just two and a half days, we completed the high-quality cotton sowing task.

These facts show that during the busy season, it is even more important to grasp the living application of Mao Zedong Thought and the living thoughts of the masses. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to solve the ideological problems of the masses promotes the revolutionization of people's thinking. Once the masses arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, they can unleash boundless creativity. Doing so can achieve double victories in revolution and production. Not believing in the masses, not arming the broad masses with Mao Zedong Thought, focusing only on the hoe and neglecting the "heads" of the people, this approach not only fails to achieve good production but also risks the restoration of capitalism.

The human mind is a battlefield. If proletarian ideology does not occupy it, bourgeois ideology will surely take over. The living thoughts exposed in a certain period reflect the struggle between the two ideologies in the mind. We must firmly grasp these living thoughts to help proletarian ideology defeat bourgeois ideology.

Chairman Mao teaches us to "grasp revolution, promote production." The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao also point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to make people's thinking revolutionary, thereby making all work done better, faster, and more efficiently." We are militia and commune members armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We have only one goal: resolutely walk the bright path of emphasizing proletarian politics. Let the "production first" theory advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev go to hell!

### 越忙越要抓活思想

    越忙越要抓活思想
    五虎大队民兵营九排政治干事　吴礼才
    中国赫鲁晓夫大肆贩卖的“生产第一”的反动谬论，往往在生产大忙季节最容易找到市场。比如，我们有些同志在大忙时，放松人的思想工作，只抓锄头，不抓“人头”，就是中了“生产第一”论的毒。
    今年春耕大忙中，我们生产队的三个作业组一起种玉米，有的组坚持田头学习，狠抓劳动时冒出来的活思想，用毛泽东思想为武器来解决自己的思想问题，结果任务完成得既快又好。有的组由于放松了政治思想工作，拚命赶速度，结果越赶思想问题越多，很多地方农活质量不合规格。最近，领导上要求我们在保证质量的前提下，五天完成棉花播种任务。我想，时间只有五天，棉地有一百多亩，劳动力又十分紧张，还有绿肥扣青、翻土、施肥、温汤浸种、平整土地等好几项准备工作没有做。在这种情况下，我们根据林副主席“四个第一”的指示，在田头办起了毛泽东思想学习班，组织民兵、社员一遍又一遍地学习毛主席关于“必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧”的教导，大家决心拿出“愚公移山”的精神来播种棉花。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，人的因素充分调动了起来，大家干劲冲天，一边劳动，一边高唱“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的语录歌。结果，只用了两天半的时间，就全部高质量地完成了棉花播种任务。
    这些事实说明，在大忙季节，也是首先要抓活学活用毛泽东思想，抓群众中的活思想，用毛泽东思想为武器，解决群众中的思想问题，促进人的思想革命化。群众一旦用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，就能发挥无穷无尽的创造力。这样做，就能取得革命、生产的双胜利。不相信群众，不用毛泽东思想武装广大人民群众，只抓锄头，不抓“人头”，这样做，不仅生产搞不好，而且资本主义要复辟。
    人的头脑就是一个阵地，无产阶级思想不去占领，资产阶级思想一定要去占领。一个时期暴露出来的活思想，反映了头脑里两种思想的斗争。我们一定要紧紧抓住这种活思想，去帮助无产阶级思想战胜资产阶级思想。
    毛主席教导我们，要“抓革命，促生产”。毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”也指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。”我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的民兵和社员，我们只有一个心眼儿：坚决走突出无产阶级政治的光明大道，让中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的反对突出无产阶级政治的“生产第一”论见鬼去吧！
