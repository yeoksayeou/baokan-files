Jiading County Joint Logistics Team Persists in Criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev During the "Three Summers" Busy Season

Using the Fields and Threshing Floors as the Battlefield for Revolutionary Criticism

Their approach is to persist in studying one of Chairman Mao's quotations, criticizing one revisionist point of the Chinese Khrushchev, and eliminating one aspect of the poison, achieving very good results.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 28th - The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Xiangxing Commune Joint Logistics Team in Jiading County, Shanghai, during the busy season of summer harvesting, summer planting, and summer management, use the fields and threshing floors as the battlefield to persistently and repeatedly criticize the revisionist black goods spread by the Chinese Khrushchev in the countryside. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have summed up the benefits of repeatedly carrying out revolutionary criticism into a catchy rhyme: "Revolutionary criticism is carried out every day, the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is held high; Revolutionary criticism is carried out repeatedly, the revisionist black goods are uprooted; Revolutionary criticism is carried out persistently, the proletarian state is secured; Revolutionary criticism is carried out by everyone, private thoughts are discarded; Work is done with high spirits, production presents a new face."

When the "Three Summers" work just began, the Joint Logistics Team started by raising the awareness of cadres and community members about the significance of revolutionary criticism. They organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat in the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, linked them to reality, recalled the facts of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in their team, and deeply realized that the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, "If socialism does not occupy the countryside, capitalism will inevitably occupy it," are unshakable truths. Revolutionary criticism cannot be done once and for all; it must be done constantly and repeatedly to eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party.

After unifying their understanding, the Joint Logistics Team fully mobilized the masses, pooled their wisdom, and solved the problem of how to persist in revolutionary criticism during the busy "Three Summers" season. After discussion, everyone agreed that to persist in carrying out revolutionary criticism during the busy farming season, the battlefield must be moved from indoors to outdoors, and revolutionary criticism must be carried out in the fields and threshing floors. They stipulated two time slots each day for criticism, each lasting half an hour. The specific approach is to persist in studying one of Chairman Mao's quotations, criticizing one revisionist point of the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, eliminating one aspect of the poison, and establishing one revolutionary viewpoint. This approach has the advantages of being flexible, time-saving, content-focused, target-oriented, and effective.

The Joint Logistics Team pays attention to linking the masses' active thoughts to repeatedly criticizing the revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. During the spring plowing period this year, some people wanted to reduce the paddy fields to plant more economic crops. In response to this active thought, the team organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "must grasp grain production," criticized the "economic leadership" revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, ensured sufficient paddy fields, and established the idea of "grain as the key." When transplanting early rice, some people's thoughts of wanting to plant more economic crops resurfaced, proposing that because of insufficient seedlings, the transplanting can have larger seedling spacing and fewer plants per acre. In response to this active thought, they again criticized the "economic leadership" revisionist fallacies, further establishing the idea of "grain as the key." The Dianbang Production Team originally planned to plant economic crops on three acres of early rice fields. Through revolutionary criticism, everyone raised their awareness of the two-line struggle, proposed the slogan "smaller seedling spacing, more fertilizer, and sufficient area," overcame the difficulty of insufficient seedlings, not only did the three acres of early rice fields not plant economic crops, but the entire grain crop area also increased by nine acres compared to the state plan.

    嘉定县联勤大队在“三夏”大忙中坚持批判中国赫鲁晓夫
    把田头场头作为革命大批判的战场
    他们的做法是：坚持学习毛主席的一条语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个修正主义论点，肃清一个方面的流毒，收到很好的效果
    新华社上海二十八日电　上海嘉定县徐行公社联勤大队贫下中农，在夏收、夏种、夏管大忙中，以田头、场头为战场，坚持反复批判中国赫鲁晓夫在农村散布的修正主义黑货。广大贫下中农把反复开展革命大批判的好处编成顺口溜说：“革命大批判天天搞，毛泽东思想红旗举得高；革命大批判反复搞，修正主义黑货连根刨；革命大批判持久搞，无产阶级江山保得牢；革命大批判人人搞，私心杂念都丢掉；工作起来干劲高，生产出现新面貌。”
   “三夏”工作刚开始时，联勤大队从提高干部、社员对革命大批判意义的认识入手，组织大家学习了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”他们以毛主席的最新指示为武器，联系实际，回忆了本大队两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的事实，深刻地认识到，伟大领袖毛主席
  “对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领”的教导，是颠扑不破的真理。革命大批判决不能一劳永逸，必须经常搞，反复搞，才能肃清中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派所散布的反革命修正主义的流毒。
    统一了认识之后，联勤大队又充分发动群众，群策群力，解决了“三夏”大忙中坚持革命大批判的方法问题。经过讨论，大家一致认为，在农忙中坚持开展革命大批判，必须把战场从屋里搬到屋外，搞好田头、场头的革命大批判。他们规定每天有两段时间进行批判，每段半小时。具体做法是，坚持学习毛主席的一条语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的一个修正主义论点，肃清一个方面的流毒，树立一个革命观点。这样做的好处是：灵活机动，时间短，内容精，目标集中，收效好。
    联勤大队注意结合群众的活思想，来反复批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的修正主义黑货。今年春耕期间，有人想减少秧田来多种经济作物。针对这种活思想，大队就组织大家学习毛主席的“必须把粮食抓紧”的教导，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派“经济挂帅”的修正主义黑货，留足了秧田，树立了“以粮为纲”的思想。早稻插秧时，有些人想多种经济作物的思想又有抬头，提出因为秧苗不足，插秧可以棵头大一点，亩数尽量少一些。针对这种活思想，他们又一次批判了“经济挂帅”的修正主义谬论，进一步树立了“以粮为纲”的思想。田浜生产队原来想把三亩早稻田种经济作物，通过革命的大批判，大家提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，提出了“棵头小一点，肥料足一点，面积种足”的口号，克服了秧苗不足的困难，不但三亩早稻田没有种经济作物，整个粮食作物面积还比国家计划增加了九亩。
