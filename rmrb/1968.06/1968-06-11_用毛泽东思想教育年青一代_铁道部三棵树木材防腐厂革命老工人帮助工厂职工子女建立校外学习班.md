Revolutionary old workers at the Three Trees Timber Preservation Factory of the Ministry of Railways enthusiastically help the factory's workers' children establish extracurricular Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Mao Zedong Thought to educate the young generation, and achieving good results.

The extracurricular Mao Zedong Thought study classes for the factory's workers' children were established in October of last year. At that time, revolutionary old workers Mao Kui-lin and Zhao You-zhi noticed that the children of workers studying in half-day schools spent more than half of their time at home and in society. How to arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought and prevent them from being infected by bourgeois ideology was a major issue in the struggle against the bourgeoisie for the hearts and minds of the youth. Therefore, they used their spare time to start the first extracurricular Mao Zedong Thought study class in their own workers' dormitory. Many workers' children eagerly signed up to participate in the study. The factory revolutionary committee attached great importance to this new initiative, providing strong support and encouragement. In less than a month, the entire factory had established twenty-six extracurricular Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Currently, nearly five hundred youths living in the workers' dormitories are organized into these study classes. They are divided into three groups based on age: senior, junior, and primary, and they study "Three Constantly Read Articles," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and songs from "Quotations from Chairman Mao" respectively.

Now, the senior and junior class students can recite the full text of "Three Constantly Read Articles" and over one hundred quotations from Chairman Mao. The children aged four to ten who participate in the Red Children Study Class can also fluently recite over thirty quotations from Chairman Mao and the full text of "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Through their studies, the children have developed a deep affection for Chairman Mao and a profound love for Mao Zedong Thought. Every day before their studies, they wish Chairman Mao eternal life and sing "The East Is Red." After their studies, they sing "The Ship Sails on Depending on the Helmsman." They also sing and dance to songs praising Chairman Mao and talk about Chairman Mao's great achievements. The youths are growing up healthily under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought.

Under the guidance of the old workers, these extracurricular Mao Zedong Thought study classes have established a revolutionary study ethos. The children put Chairman Mao's teachings into practice. Some students, after studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," voluntarily helped clean the coal yard and tidy up the woodpile at a nearby coal shop. Some students who used to like fighting and did not care for public property have, through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism in the study classes, developed a sense of protecting public property and national assets.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao said, "If one does not understand what class is, does not understand what exploitation is, one does not understand revolution." To strengthen the education of class and class struggle for the youths, the extracurricular Mao Zedong Thought study classes for the factory's workers' children often invite old workers to share their bitter experiences from the old society, denounce the crimes of the old society, and sing the praises of the new society, so that the children receive a deep class education from a young age. The children all pledge to Chairman Mao: to firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, forever follow Chairman Mao, and vow to be red successors.

The extracurricular Mao Zedong Thought study classes also form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, going deep into residential areas to perform cultural programs for the families of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and neighborhood residents, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

    用毛泽东思想教育年青一代
    铁道部三棵树木材防腐厂革命老工人帮助工厂职工子女建立校外学习班
    据新华社哈尔滨电  铁道部三棵树木材防腐厂革命老工人热情帮助工厂职工子女建立校外毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想教育年青一代，收到了良好的效果。
    这个厂职工子女的校外毛泽东思想学习班是在去年十月份开始办起来的。当时，这个厂的革命老工人牟奎林、赵有看到在二部制学校学习的职工子女，每天有一半以上的时间在家庭和社会上度过，如何用毛泽东思想武装他们的头脑，使他们不受社会上资产阶级思想的侵蚀，这是和资产阶级争夺青少年的一个重大问题。于是，他们就利用业余时间在自己住的职工宿舍，办起了第一个校外毛泽东思想学习班。许多职工子女纷纷报名要求参加学习。工厂革命委员会对这个新生事物非常重视，给予大力支持和扶植。不到一个月的时间，全厂就办起了二十六个校外毛泽东思想学习班。目前，这个厂集中居住的职工宿舍中已有四百九十多名青少年分别组织在这些学习班里学习。他们按照年龄分成大、中、小三个班，分别学习“老三篇”、《毛主席语录》、毛主席最新指示和毛主席语录歌等。
    现在，校外学习班的大、中班同学都能背诵“老三篇”全文和毛主席的一百多条语录。参加红孩子学习班的四岁至十岁的孩子，也都能熟练地背诵毛主席的三十多条语录和《为人民服务》全文。通过学习，大大培养了孩子们无限忠于毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想的深厚感情。孩子们每天学习前敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，高唱《东方红》，学习后唱《大海航行靠舵手》，他们还天天唱颂扬毛主席的歌曲，跳颂扬毛主席的舞蹈，大讲毛主席的丰功伟绩。青少年在毛泽东思想哺育下茁壮地成长。
    这些校外毛泽东思想学习班在老工人的指导下，建立了革命的好学风。孩子们对毛主席的教导学了就用。有的同学学了毛主席的光辉著作《为人民服务》，主动到附近的煤店帮助清理煤场，整理木柴垛；有些同学过去喜欢打架，不爱护公物，经过在学习班里斗私批修，树立了爱护公物、爱护国家财产的观念。
    林彪副主席说：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”为了对青少年加强阶级和阶级斗争的教育，这个厂职工子女的校外毛泽东思想学习班，还经常请老工人给孩子们讲旧社会的苦难经历，控诉旧社会的罪恶，歌颂新社会的幸福，使孩子们从小受到深刻的阶级教育。孩子们都向毛主席宣誓：坚决把毛泽东思想学到手，永远紧跟毛主席，誓作红色接班人。
    校外毛泽东思想学习班，还组成毛泽东思想宣传队，深入居民区为工人家属、贫下中农和街道居民演出文艺节目，宣传毛泽东思想。
