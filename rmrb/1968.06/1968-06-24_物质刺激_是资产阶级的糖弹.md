Everything for money, money is everything. This is the creed of the bourgeoisie, the morality of capitalism.

The "material incentives" that the Chinese Khrushchev passionately advocates are nothing but the rotten goods picked from the bourgeoisie's garbage heap, goods that seek money rather than revolution.

Look, this faithful henchman of the bourgeoisie shouts at the top of his lungs: "There should be an award system, not necessarily for products, money can also be awarded." "Without adding some money, production enthusiasm is insufficient, if you don't produce well, I won't give you money." "Material incentives are necessary." And so on, and so forth.

It's truly stinking of copper coins, the stench can be smelled eight hundred miles against the wind!

Enthusiasm has never been abstract, transcending classes. There is socialist enthusiasm, and there is capitalist enthusiasm.

Socialist enthusiasm cannot be stimulated by money. It can only come from motives without any selfishness, and it can only originate from the radiant Mao Zedong Thought.

As early as 1942, when Chairman Mao expounded on the great achievements of our army's self-sufficient production, he pointed out profoundly: "What has achieved these results? It is the enthusiastic leadership of the cadres and the labor enthusiasm of the soldiers. The cadres have consciously led the production movement to overcome the difficulties in the revolutionary process. The soldiers have also consciously participated in production labor to overcome the difficulties in the revolutionary process."

Therefore, in developing socialist production, we do not rely on material incentives, nor do we rely on coercive measures, but on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. By arming people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought and promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, we can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of people to build socialism. Practice has proven and will continue to prove that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will be transformed into a great material force, bringing about a leap in production.

On the contrary, the "enthusiasm" stimulated by money and material incentives must be capitalist enthusiasm. Money and material incentives cater to the backward psychology of a few people, which can stimulate their selfish "enthusiasm." However, the higher this "enthusiasm," the more bourgeois thoughts will be in their heads, the more they will enter a dead end of not caring about the interests of the state, the collective, and the long-term, but only pursuing personal temporary interests.

Using money to corrupt and buy your soul, to undermine your vigorous revolutionary spirit, to make you forget the revolution, forget proletarian politics, forget class struggle, and blindly follow the capitalist road, this is the evil intention of the Chinese Khrushchev in vigorously advocating "material incentives."

Under socialist conditions, the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party use "material incentives" as sugar bullets to attack the proletariat, attempting to use bourgeois selfishness to corrupt the masses, using "bonuses" and "welfare" and the like to cover up the sharp struggle between restoration and anti-restoration. We see that in the countries controlled by the revisionist clique, without exception, they all use the means of "material incentives" to corrupt the revolutionary spirit of the working class, so that they can carry out the activities of restoring capitalism.

The sugar bullets fired by the bourgeoisie can knock down some people because there is a "self" in their minds. Selfishness is the target of sugar bullets, and we should be alert to this.

We know that the exploiting class, as the ruling class of society, has been around for thousands of years. The core of exploiting class thought—the "self"—as the ruling thought of society, has also been around for thousands of years. This is the condition that makes the poison of "material incentives" easy to spread.

Therefore, if we do not criticize "material incentives" more vilely than shit, if we do not launch an annihilation campaign against the "self," we will definitely be defeated in front of the sugar bullets.

The law of class struggle deeply reminds us: exposing the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists does not mean that their influence has been eliminated; eliminating the old bourgeois representatives will produce new bourgeois representatives. Therefore, we must always unswervingly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, and turn Chairman Mao's great line of "Criticize selfishness, criticize revisionism" into great practice. Only in this way can we fundamentally block the path of the bourgeoisie borrowing "self" to revive, and only in this way can we ensure that we always follow the course opened by Chairman Mao, marching forward bravely!

### “物质刺激”是资产阶级的糖弹

    “物质刺激”是资产阶级的糖弹
    巴移山
    一切为了金钱，金钱就是一切。这是资产阶级的信条，资本主义的道德。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所狂热鼓吹的“物质刺激”，就是从资产阶级的垃圾堆里拣来的要金钱而不要革命的破烂货。
    且看，这个资产阶级的忠实走卒是如何声嘶力竭地叫嚷的：“要有奖励制度，不一定奖产品，奖钱也可以。”“不加点钱，生产积极性不够，不好好给你生产。”“物质刺激是必要的。”等等，等等。
    真是铜臭熏天，顶风还臭八百里！
    积极性从来不是抽象的，超阶级的。有社会主义的积极性，也有资本主义的积极性。
    社会主义积极性，决非金钱所能刺激出来的。它只能出自毫无利己的动机，只能来源于光芒四射的毛泽东思想。
    早在一九四二年，毛主席在论述我军生产自给的巨大成绩时，就曾深刻指出：“这种成绩是依靠了什么才达到的呢？是依靠了干部们的积极领导与战士们的劳动热忱才达到的。干部们是自觉地为了克服革命过程中的困难而去积极地指导生产运动的。战士们也是自觉地为了克服革命过程中的困难而去参加生产劳动的。”
    所以，我们发展社会主义生产，既不靠物质刺激，也不靠强制手段，而是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑，促使人的思想革命化，就能最充分地调动起亿万群众建设社会主义的积极性。实践已经证明，并且还将不断证明，毛泽东思想一旦掌握了群众，就会转化为巨大的物质力量，带来生产的飞跃发展。
    反之，用金钱、物质刺激出来的“积极性”，必然是资本主义的积极性。金钱、物质迎合了少数人的落后心理，是能刺激这些人自私自利的“积极性”的。但是，这种“积极性”愈高，脑袋瓜的资产阶级思想就愈浓，就越要走入不顾国家利益、集体利益、长远利益，而单纯追求个人暂时利益的死胡同。
    用金钱腐蚀、收买你的灵魂，搞掉你旺盛的革命斗志，叫你忘掉革命，忘掉无产阶级政治，忘掉阶级斗争，稀里糊涂地跟着走资本主义邪路，造成在我国复辟资本主义的条件，这便是中国赫鲁晓夫竭力鼓吹“物质刺激”的罪恶用心。
    在社会主义条件下，混入党内的资产阶级代表人物以“物质刺激”作为向无产阶级进攻的糖弹，搞和平演变。他们企图以资产阶级利己主义腐蚀群众，用“奖金”“福利”等等来掩盖尖锐的复辟和反复辟的斗争。我们看到，那些被修正主义集团控制的国家，无一例外地都是用“物质刺激”的手段来腐蚀工人阶级的革命斗志，以便他们放手进行复辟资本主义的活动。
    资产阶级发射的糖弹，所以能打倒一些人，是因为这些人的头脑里有一个“私”字。私心是糖弹的靶子，应该引起我们警惕。
    我们知道，剥削阶级作为社会的统治阶级，已有几千年。剥削阶级思想的核心——“私”字，作为社会的统治思想，也有几千年。这是“物质刺激”的流毒易于传播的条件。
    因而，如果不将“物质刺激”批得比狗屎还臭，如果不对“私”字发动一场歼灭战，我们就一定会在糖弹面前打败仗。
    阶级斗争的规律深刻地告诫我们：揪出了中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，并不等于肃清了他们的影响；清除了旧的资产阶级代表人物，还会产生新的资产阶级代表人物。因而，我们只有始终不渝地高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把毛主席的“斗私，批修”这个伟大纲领变成伟大实践，才能从根本上杜绝资产阶级借“私”还“魂”的途径，才能保证我们永远沿着毛主席开辟的航道，勇往直前！
