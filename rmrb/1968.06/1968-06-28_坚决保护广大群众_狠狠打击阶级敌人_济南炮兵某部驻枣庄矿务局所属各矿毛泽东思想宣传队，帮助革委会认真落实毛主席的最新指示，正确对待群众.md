Recently, the propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought from a certain artillery unit of the Jinan Military Region stationed at the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau's various mines has studied Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." They follow the teachings of the great teacher Chairman Mao, link the teachings to reality, summarize and exchange experiences from their work of supporting the left, and unanimously agree that after the proletarian revolutionaries take power, they must continuously raise their awareness of the great significance of protecting the masses and be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

After the proletarian revolutionaries took power and established the revolutionary committees, they should treat Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their guiding principles. The propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought stationed at the mines pays great attention to helping the members of the revolutionary committees correctly treat the masses, making the revolutionary committees firmly stand on the side of the broad masses, closely link with the masses, and be heart to heart with the masses. They always represent the interests of the masses and resolutely protect the broad masses of the people.

To protect the broad masses, one must correctly handle the masses' criticisms and supervision.

The revolutionary committees correctly handling the masses' criticisms and supervision is an important aspect of correctly treating and protecting the masses. Worker Duan Chengming from the Taozhuang Coal Mine was elected as the head of the revolutionary committee. After taking office, he was not as humble as before when facing the masses' opinions. One day, revolutionary masses posted a big-character poster at the door of Duan Chengming's office, sharply criticizing his tendency to detach from the masses. Duan Chengming saw the poster and felt angry. He thought that after becoming a responsible person in the revolutionary committee, he had been working hard for everyone, getting up early and staying up late. This poster was obviously trying to undermine him. After learning about this incident, the propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought immediately conducted an investigation. They believed that the masses criticizing the comrades of the revolutionary committee was a good thing and that they should help Duan Chengming correctly treat the masses and not ignore them just because he couldn't stand it or understand it. If he stood against the masses and suppressed them, he would definitely make a big mistake. Therefore, Comrade Lu Qingkui from the propaganda team went to talk with Duan Chengming, studying Chairman Mao's teachings with him: "We Communists are not seeking office but seeking revolution. We must have thorough revolutionary spirit. We must not detach from the masses for a single moment." "Because we serve the people, we are not afraid of being criticized and pointed out by anyone. No matter who you are, if you point out our mistakes, we will correct them." After studying, Lu Qingkui seriously told Duan Chengming: "After the proletarian revolutionaries take power, their position changes. The masses giving us advice is caring for us, not giving advice is harming us. In the past, the capitalist roaders did not allow the masses to speak, and they were afraid of the masses and criticism, detached from reality and the masses, and eventually fell into the quagmire of revisionism." He continued, "The people's power must protect the masses, cherish the masses, and treat the masses with enthusiasm. We must not follow the old path!" Later, they changed into work clothes and went down the coal mine together. They worked while seeking the opinions of the worker comrades. The worker comrades saw Duan Chengming working in the mine with everyone else, and their spirits were still as high as before. They all happily patted his shoulder and said: "Old Duan, you work hard for everyone, and we see it in our hearts. But in recent days, you have been in the office more and less among the masses, and we are not at ease. We wrote the big-character poster to remind you, fearing that you would follow the old path..." Duan Chengming, moved, said: "Comrades posting the big-character poster is not to undermine me but to help me never detach from the masses. In the future, I welcome everyone to criticize my shortcomings and mistakes in my work, help me clean up the dirt in my mind, and become a servant who wholeheartedly serves the people." Since then, Duan Chengming's heart has been even closer to the worker comrades, and the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm has been even higher than before.

To protect the broad masses, one must firmly believe in the majority of the masses.

To protect the broad masses, one must, at any time, firmly believe that more than 95% of the masses are good. Due to the sabotage and disruption by a handful of class enemies, the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in the Zaozhuang mining area has experienced many ups and downs. During the period when a handful of capitalist roaders implemented the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, at the critical moment of the power struggle, and when the class enemies were vigorously pushing the rightist reversal, some masses were deceived, used, and incited by the class enemies, stood on the wrong side, and made various mistakes, causing conflicts between the masses and between the masses and the revolutionary committees. Correctly treating these masses, resolutely protecting and helping these masses is a major task for the proletarian revolutionaries to be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to take power correctly, and to use power correctly. The propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought stationed at the mines firmly believes that the masses who stood on the wrong side love Chairman Mao and will listen to Chairman Mao's words. Through education, they can return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Protecting and helping these masses is not only in words but more importantly in actions. The propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought stationed at the mines helped the proletarian revolutionaries and the masses who stood on the wrong side to study Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat together, expose the crimes of the class enemies, and vigorously carry out heart-to-heart talks and "one help one" and "one pair red" activities. Comrade Xie Peigeng, a member of the revolutionary committee of the Weizhuang Coal Mine, was once beaten by a deceived worker. Later, when the worker apologized to him, Xie Peigeng said: "You are also a victim. This account should be settled with Liu Shaoqi and a handful of capitalist roaders in the mine. We are class brothers and must listen to Chairman Mao's words, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution." The worker was moved to tears. Later, he studied Chairman Mao's works diligently and was evaluated as an active participant in the revolution and production in the first quarter of this year. The propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought stationed at the mines promptly publicized this typical case, educating the broad masses and raising their awareness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Everyone felt that protecting and helping the deceived masses was defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, consolidating the newly born revolutionary committees, and isolating a handful of class enemies to the greatest extent.

To protect the broad masses, one must continuously and persistently launch attacks on the class enemies.

The Zaozhuang mining area has a history of over 300 years. In the past 100 years, it has suffered from the bloody rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. After liberation, although a large number of young workers and peasants from rural areas were recruited into the mines, due to Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the coal industry, who inherited the legacy of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and attempted to restore capitalism in the mining area. For a long time, a handful of traitors, spies, and remnants of the Kuomintang have not been cleaned up and struck down, and some have even been heavily used. Therefore, the class struggle has always been sharp, complex, and intense.

With the help of the propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought stationed at the mines, the revolutionary committees at all levels in the Zaozhuang mining area have been firmly grasping the class struggle and launching continuous attacks on the class enemies. After the establishment of the revolutionary committees, the first major task was to set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, conduct bitter-sweet education, and raise the class struggle awareness and two-line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary masses and cadres. The revolutionary committees used the "big grave" and "white bone pagoda," where the massacred miners were buried, as classrooms for class education, organizing deep-hated miners to denounce the old society. Many miners, with tears in their eyes, recalled their tragic past lives, saying: "Miners going down the pit, 'cattle and horse' lives are hard to keep, old water soaks the legs, big baskets break the waist, sick without care, dead wrapped in mats." Today, happy life is limitlessly good, and sesame flowers bloom node by node. The miners could not help but say: "The sky is big, the earth is big, but the party's kindness is the biggest. Father and mother are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer." They poured the deepest proletarian love into the great leader Chairman Mao; they concentrated the most bitter hatred of the proletariat on Liu Shaoqi. Everyone unanimously recognized that if Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the mining area were not overthrown and thoroughly criticized, and this political revolution was not carried out to the end, the broad masses of the people would suffer twice. The revolutionary committees are the organizational and commanding departments for the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary workers to charge and attack the class enemies. Only by continuously and persistently launching attacks on the class enemies can the masses be truly protected.

A battle of actively attacking the enemy has been launched! Through mobilizing the masses to observe the situation, investigate the enemy situation, expose extensively, and criticize extensively, a handful of counter-revolutionary two-faced people who infiltrated into the revolutionary committee of the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau were exposed, and a handful of traitors, spies, die-hard capitalist roaders, and other counter-revolutionary elements were unearthed. They used Liu Shaoqi and these people as living teaching materials, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and mouth and pen to execute them, deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism.

Through revolutionary criticism, the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses' morale was greatly boosted, and the handful of class enemies' arrogance was greatly diminished. The broad masses have never been as spirited and enthusiastic as today, proud of being masters of their own fate, and proud of their new-born revolutionary power. Now, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee of the mining area, a vast revolutionary and production army has been formed, achieving double victories in revolution and production. The entire mining area completed the first half of the year's excavation plan 22 days ahead of schedule on June 8; and completed the first half of the year's national coal mining plan 12 days ahead of schedule on June 18.

    坚决保护广大群众　狠狠打击阶级敌人
    济南炮兵某部驻枣庄矿务局所属各矿毛泽东思想宣传队，帮助革委会认真落实毛主席的最新指示，正确对待群众
    本报讯　最近，人民解放军济南炮兵某部驻枣庄矿务局所属各矿毛泽东思想宣传队，认真学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”他们遵循伟大导师毛主席的这一教导，联系实际，总结交流了支左工作中的经验，一致认为，在无产阶级革命派掌权以后，必须不断提高对保护群众的伟大意义的认识，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。
    无产阶级革命派掌了权，成立了革命委员会以后，应该把毛主席的最新指示当作座右铭。驻矿毛泽东思想宣传队十分注意帮助革命委员会成员正确对待群众，使革委会坚定不移地站在广大人民群众一边，密切联系群众，和群众心连心，始终代表群众利益，坚决保护广大人民群众。
    要保护广大人民群众，就要正确对待群众的批评和监督
    革命委员会正确对待群众的批评和监督，是正确对待群众、保护群众的一个重要方面。陶庄煤矿工人段成明，当选为革命委员会主任以后，对待群众的意见不象以前那么虚心了。有一天，革命群众在段成明的办公室门口，贴了一张大字报，对他脱离群众的现象提出尖锐批评。段成明看了大字报，心里就火了。他觉得当了革命委员会负责人以后，自己是一颗心贴在矿上，起早贪黑为着大家。这张大字报明明是拆自己的台。驻矿毛泽东思想宣传队知道这件事后，马上进行调查研究。大家认为：群众对革命委员会的同志提意见，是好事，应该帮助段成明正确对待群众，不能因为看不惯、想不通就不理睬。如果站在群众的对立面，压制群众，就非犯大错误不可。于是，宣传队的卢清奎同志就去找段成明谈心，和他一起学习毛主席的教导：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”学习后，卢清奎语重心长地对段成明说：“无产阶级革命派掌权后，地位就起了变化。群众给咱提意见是爱护咱们，不提意见倒是害了咱们。过去走资派不许群众讲话，老虎屁股摸不得，害怕群众，害怕批评，脱离实际，脱离群众，最后滑进了修正主义的泥坑。”他接着又说：“人民的政权，要保护群众，要爱护群众，要满腔热情地对待群众，可千万不能走过去的老路啊！”后来，他们俩就换上工作服，一起下了煤井。他们边干活，边征求工人同志的意见。工人同志看到段成明下井和大家一起劳动，劲头仍然和从前一样，都高兴地拍着他的肩膀说：“老段呀！你为大伙操心，俺都看在眼里，喜在心上。可是，你前些日子坐办公室多了，到群众里少了，俺不放心。给你写大字报是提醒你，怕你走过去的老路……。”段成明听了工人同志的心里话，激动地说：“同志们贴我的大字报不是拆我的台，是帮助我永远不脱离群众。往后，欢迎大家多批评我工作上的缺点和错误，帮助我扫除脑子里的脏东西，做一个全心全意为人民服务的勤务员。”打这以后，段成明与工人同志们的心贴得更紧了，群众的革命积极性比过去更高了。
    要保护广大人民群众，就要坚定不移地相信群众的大多数
    要保护广大人民群众，就要在任何时候，坚定不移地相信百分之九十五以上的群众是好的。枣庄矿区的无产阶级文化大革命，由于一小撮阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱，曾出现过多次反复。在一小撮走资派推行资产阶级反动路线期间，在夺权斗争的关键时刻，在阶级敌人大搞右倾翻案的时候，都有一部分群众被阶级敌人蒙蔽、利用和挑动，站错了队，犯了这样那样的错误，造成了群众与群众，群众与革命委员会之间的对立。正确对待这些群众，坚决保护和帮助这些群众，是无产阶级革命派无限忠于毛主席革命路线，掌好权、用好权的大事。驻矿毛泽东思想宣传队坚信站错队的群众是热爱毛主席的，是会听毛主席的话的，经过教育，是能够回到毛主席革命路线上来的。保护和帮助这些群众，不仅在口头上，更重要的是在实际行动上。驻矿毛泽东思想宣传队帮助无产阶级革命派和站错队的群众，一起学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，揭露阶级敌人的罪恶事实，大力开展谈心活动和“一帮一”、“一对红”活动。位庄煤矿革命委员会委员谢培庚，曾经被受蒙蔽工人打过。后来，打过他的那个工人向他认错的时候，谢培庚说：“你也是受害的，这笔账要算在中国赫鲁晓夫身上，要算在矿上的一小撮走资派身上。我们都是阶级兄弟，要听毛主席的话，永远忠于毛主席，永远跟毛主席闹革命。”这个工人感动得流出了眼泪。以后，他努力学习毛主席著作，今年第一季度被评为抓革命促生产的积极分子。驻矿毛泽东思想宣传队及时宣传了这个典型事例，教育广大群众，提高了对毛主席革命路线的认识。大家感到，保护和帮助受蒙蔽群众，就是捍卫毛主席的革命路线，巩固新生的革命委员会，最大限度地孤立了一小撮阶级敌人。
    要保护广大人民群众，就要不停顿地、持续地向阶级敌人发起进攻
    枣庄矿区有三百多年的历史，近一百多年来受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的血腥统治。解放后虽然吸收了大批工农青年入矿，但是，由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在煤炭系统的代理人，继承了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的衣钵，推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图在矿区复辟资本主义。长期以来，一小撮叛徒、特务和国民党的残渣余孽得不到清理和打击，有的还受到重用。因此，阶级斗争一直是尖锐、复杂和激烈的。
    枣庄矿区各级革命委员会在驻矿毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，狠抓阶级斗争不转向，猛攻阶级敌人不停顿。革命委员会成立后，第一件大事是办起了毛泽东思想学习班，进行忆苦思甜教育，提高广大革命群众和干部的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。革委会把埋葬着被屠杀的矿工的“大坟子”、“白骨塔”作为阶级教育的课堂，组织苦大仇深的矿工控诉旧社会。许多矿工含着眼泪回忆过去的悲惨生活，他们说：“矿工要下窑，‘牛马’命难保，老水泡烂腿，大筐折断腰，病了无人管，死了用席包。”今天，幸福生活无限好，芝麻开花节节高。矿工们情不自禁地说：天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。他们把最深厚的无产阶级的爱，倾注在伟大领袖毛主席身上；把无产阶级最刻骨的恨，集中在中国赫鲁晓夫身上。大家一致认识到，不把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在矿区的代理人斗倒斗臭，把这场政治大革命进行到底，广大人民群众就要吃二遍苦。革命委员会是组织和指挥无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工向阶级敌人冲锋陷阵的战斗指挥部，要不停顿地、持续地向阶级敌人发起进攻，才能真正地保护群众。
    一场主动向敌人的进攻战打响了！通过发动群众看形势，查敌情，大揭发，大批判，揪出了混进枣庄矿务局革命委员会内的反革命两面派，挖出了一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和其他反革命分子。他们把中国赫鲁晓夫和这些家伙作为活教材，以毛泽东思想为武器，人人口诛笔伐，深入持久地开展革命大批判。
    通过革命大批判，大长了无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的志气，大灭了一小撮阶级敌人的威风。广大群众从来没有象今天这样意气风发，斗志昂扬，为自己当家作主而自豪，为自己新生的革命政权而骄傲。现在，在矿区革委会的领导下，组成了浩浩荡荡的革命和生产大军，夺取了革命生产双胜利。全矿区六月八日提前二十二天完成上半年掘进计划；六月十八日提前十二天完成了上半年国家采煤计划。
