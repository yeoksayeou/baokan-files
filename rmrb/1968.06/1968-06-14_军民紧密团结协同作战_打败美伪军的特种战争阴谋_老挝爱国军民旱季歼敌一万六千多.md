The Lao People's Liberation Army and patriotic forces, along with the people of all ethnic groups nationwide, have closely united and fought side by side, defeating the special warfare plots of U.S. imperialism and its puppets. In the dry season of 1967-1968, they eliminated over 16,000 enemy troops.

	KANGO, June 13 (Xinhua) - According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, the Lao People's Liberation Army High Command issued a report on June 10, enthusiastically celebrating the Lao patriotic military and civilian forces' brilliant victory of eliminating over 16,000 enemy troops during this period.

	The report stated: From last November to the end of May this year, the Lao People's Liberation Army, together with patriotic neutral forces and people of all ethnic groups nationwide, launched continuous and proactive attacks against the enemy on various battlefields. According to incomplete statistics, in 940 battles, they eliminated a total of 16,212 enemy troops, including 7,189 killed, seized over 5,274 weapons of various types, and thousands of tons of military supplies. They also sank or destroyed 33 motorboats and patrol boats, shot down or destroyed 107 enemy aircraft, blew up eight important bridges, destroyed 11 oil depots and ammunition depots, and damaged three radar stations.

	The report said: During this dry season, the Lao patriotic military and civilian forces eliminated a large number of enemy troops and destroyed many of the enemy's rear supply bases for their aggressive war.

	The number of enemy troops eliminated by the Lao patriotic military and civilian forces in this dry season is three times the total number eliminated in the 1966-1967 dry season and equivalent to one-quarter of the total number of troops in the right-wing Lao army.

	The report pointed out: During this dry season, the Lao patriotic military and civilian forces dealt a heavy blow to the strategic mobile forces and special forces of U.S. imperialism and its puppets, annihilating seven enemy battalions, dissolving or forcing the surrender of 13 battalions, and severely damaging 32 battalions. In addition, the Lao patriotic military and civilian forces also destroyed 18 enemy command posts, including the South Bole region field command post and the enemy division command posts in Atsapho and Saravane.

	The report said: During this period, the Lao patriotic military and civilian forces reclaimed many strategic strongholds that had been illegally occupied by the enemy, uprooted many bandit nests in the provinces of Sam Neua, Phongsali, and Udomsai, and thus foiled the plots of U.S. imperialism and its puppets to use special forces to sabotage the liberated areas. In this dry season, they liberated 1,343 villages with a population of over 172,000.

	The report said: The great victories achieved by the Lao patriotic military and civilian forces have caused the special warfare plots of U.S. imperialism and its puppets to suffer a heavy defeat. Enemy morale is low, internal contradictions are intensifying, and U.S. imperialism and its puppets are in a passive and defensive situation. Meanwhile, the Lao patriotic armed forces are rapidly growing in all aspects.

	The report said: Currently, the Lao patriotic military and civilian forces are continuously achieving great victories, while U.S. imperialism and its puppets are failing and weakening. However, the U.S. and its puppets will still use various tricks and schemes to try to save their failures.

	The report called on the Lao patriotic military and civilian forces to see through the stubborn and reactionary nature of U.S. imperialism and its puppets, to stay vigilant, to strengthen their courage, to continue to heavily strike U.S. imperialism and its puppets, to eliminate more enemy troops, and to achieve even greater victories.

	The Lao People's Liberation Army, together with patriotic neutral forces and people of all ethnic groups nationwide, has united closely and demonstrated the immense power of people's war, launching continuous and proactive attacks against the enemy on various battlefields. In the dry season battles from last November to the end of May this year, the Lao patriotic military and civilian forces achieved brilliant victories, eliminating over 16,000 enemy troops and dealing a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its puppets.

    军民紧密团结协同作战　打败美伪军的特种战争阴谋
    老挝爱国军民旱季歼敌一万六千多
    新华社康开十三日电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝人民解放军最高指挥部六月十日发表一九六七——一九六八年旱季战绩公报，热烈欢呼老挝爱国军民在这期间取得歼敌一万六千多名的辉煌胜利。
    公报说：从去年十一月到今年五月底，老挝人民解放军同爱国中立力量以及全国各族人民紧密团结，在各个战场上连续主动地打击敌人，据不完全的统计，在九百四十次的战斗中，共歼敌一万六千二百一十二名，其中打死七千一百八十九名，缴获各种武器五千二百七十四件、军用物资数千吨，击沉击毁汽艇和机动艇三十三艘，击落击毁敌机一百零七架，炸毁重要桥梁八座，炸毁油库、弹药库十一座，破坏雷达三台。
    公报说：在这个旱季里，老挝爱国军民歼灭敌人大批有生力量，捣毁敌人许多侵略战争后勤基地。
    老挝爱国军民在这个旱季里的歼敌数字相当于一九六六——一九六七年旱季歼敌总数的三倍，相当于老挝右派军队总数的四分之一。
    公报指出：老挝爱国军民在这个旱季里沉重地打击了美帝国主义及其走狗的战略机动力量和特种部队，全歼敌人七个营，瓦解或迫降十三个营，重创三十二个营。此外，老挝爱国军民还摧毁了敌人十八个指挥部，其中包括南博地区野战指挥部和阿速坡、沙拉湾敌军分区指挥部。
    公报说：在这期间，老挝爱国军民收复了许多被敌人非法蚕食的战略要地，拔除了敌人在桑怒、丰沙里、乌多姆塞等省的许多土匪巢穴，从而粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗利用特种部队破坏解放区的阴谋计划。在这个旱季里解放了包括十七万两千多居民的一千三百四十三个村庄。
    公报说：老挝爱国军民所取得的上述巨大胜利，使得美帝国主义及其走狗的特种战争阴谋计划遭到了惨重失败，敌军士气低落，敌人内部矛盾日益加剧，美帝国主义及其走狗陷入被动挨打的困境。而老挝爱国武装力量在各方面得到迅速的成长。
    公报说：目前，老挝爱国军民正在不断取得巨大胜利，美帝国主义及其走狗正在失败和衰弱。但是美帝及其走狗还会采用种种阴谋诡计，以挽救自己的失败。
    公报号召老挝爱国军民看清美帝国主义及其走狗的顽固而反动的本质，提高警惕，增强勇气，继续沉重地打击美帝国主义及其走狗，歼灭敌人更多的有生力量，夺取更加巨大的胜利。（附图片）
