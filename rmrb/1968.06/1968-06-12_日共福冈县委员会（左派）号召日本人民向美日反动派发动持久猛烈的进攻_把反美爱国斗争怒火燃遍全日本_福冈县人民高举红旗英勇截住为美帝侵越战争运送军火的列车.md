The Japanese Communist Party (Left Wing) in Fukuoka Prefecture issued a statement on June 7, enthusiastically praising the anti-American patriotic movement that has erupted among the people of various sectors in Japan in response to the crash and burning of a U.S. military aircraft on the campus of Kyushu University. The statement calls on Japanese workers, students, and the broad masses to take action and launch a broader struggle against U.S. imperialism. The statement also calls on the Japanese working class to resolutely go on political strikes and, with the workers' strike struggle as the center, establish a powerful united front with the participation of people from all strata to launch a prolonged and fierce struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

The statement says that since the crash of the U.S. military aircraft on the campus of Kyushu University, workers, youth, students, and the broad masses in Fukuoka City have held meetings and bravely taken to the streets to demonstrate. They angrily shouted slogans such as "Remove the U.S. military base in Itazuke!" "Abolish the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!" and "Drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan!" They directed the spearhead of their struggle directly at U.S. imperialism. The statement says that this is a great anti-American patriotic struggle. This struggle shows that there is an irresistible revolutionary force among the people of Fukuoka City.

The statement strongly condemns the treacherous acts of the Miyamoto revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party in colluding with the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to sabotage the revolutionary mass movement in Japan. The statement says that at this critical moment in the struggle, the Miyamoto revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party has jumped out, standing on the side of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, loudly calling for "orderly action" and maliciously slandering patriotic students as "provocateurs." They attempt to drag the anti-American movement of Japanese workers and students into the parliamentary swamp, making the Japanese people give up the struggle. This once again exposes the traitorous face of the Miyamoto revisionist clique. The statement says that we must resolutely smash the disruptive activities of these "parliamentary illusions" and counter-revolutionary revisionists.

In discussing the current favorable international situation, the statement says that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, the struggle of black people in the United States against violence, the revolutionary struggle of the French people, and the anti-imperialist storm sweeping the world have dealt heavy blows to world imperialism led by U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, making them increasingly decline.

The statement concludes by saying, "Let us closely unite with the people of China and the people of the world, and with full confidence, spread the flames of the anti-American patriotic struggle throughout Japan."

The Japanese Communist Party (Left Wing) in Yamaguchi Prefecture also issued a statement on the same day, supporting the anti-American struggle of the people of various sectors in Fukuoka City.

According to a report by the East China News Agency on June 11, 500 patriotic workers and students in Fukuoka Prefecture bravely stopped a train carrying military supplies for the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam near the U.S. military ammunition depot in Kitakyushu City this morning, dealing a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism. This is the fifth time since the beginning of this year that patriotic workers and students in Fukuoka Prefecture have taken militant action to stop the transportation of military supplies for the U.S. military.

This morning, before dawn, workers and students lined up and marched towards the U.S. Air Force Yamada ammunition depot. At 7 a.m., before the train carrying military supplies arrived, they held a powerful demonstration march on the railway tracks from the ammunition depot to Minami-Ogura Station. Seeing the train carrying military supplies approaching, the brave workers and students held up red flags and stopped the military supply train. The demonstrators sat in front of the locomotive. Some boarded the locomotive and propagandized to the driver not to do work for U.S. imperialism. They also pasted anti-U.S. leaflets all over the train.

The demonstrators continuously shouted, "We will fight until all U.S. soldiers are driven out of Japan!" "Abolish the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!" "Oppose U.S. aggression against Vietnam!"

A passenger train passed by the demonstration on the adjacent track. Many passengers waved and cheered in support of this just anti-American patriotic struggle.

The reactionary Sato government, in order to suppress the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic movement, dispatched 1,000 armed police to brutally suppress the demonstrators in the afternoon, injuring dozens and arbitrarily arresting ten. However, the patriotic workers and students, undaunted by the violence, persisted in their struggle until 5 p.m., forcing the train carrying U.S. military supplies to stop for ten hours.

The revolutionary masses in Hofu City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, held a demonstration rally against the revival of Japanese militarism, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao and banners reading "Long Live the Great Thought of Mao Zedong! Ten Thousand Years! Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand Years!"

### 日共福冈县委员会（左派）号召日本人民向美日反动派发动持久猛烈的进攻　把反美爱国斗争怒火燃遍全日本  福冈县人民高举红旗英勇截住为美帝侵越战争运送军火的列车

    日共福冈县委员会（左派）号召日本人民向美日反动派发动持久猛烈的进攻
  　把反美爱国斗争怒火燃遍全日本
    福冈县人民高举红旗英勇截住为美帝侵越战争运送军火的列车
    新华社东京电　日本共产党福冈县委员会（左派）七日发表声明，热烈赞扬日本各界人民抗议美国强盗飞机坠落并焚毁九州大学建筑物而掀起的反美爱国运动，并号召日本工人、学生和广大人民行动起来，更加广泛地掀起反对美帝国主义的斗争。声明还号召日本工人阶级坚决举行政治罢工，并以工人阶级的罢工斗争为中心，建立一个有各阶层人民参加的强有力的统一战线，向美日反动派发动持久的猛烈的斗争。
    声明说，自从美国军用飞机坠落在九州大学以后，福冈市的工人、青年、学生和广大人民纷纷举行集会，并英勇地走上街头举行示威游行。他们愤怒地高呼“撤除美军板付基地！”“废除日美‘安全条约’！”“把美帝国主义从日本赶出去！”的口号，把斗争矛头直接指向美帝国主义。声明说，这是伟大的反美爱国斗争。这场斗争表明，福冈市人民中间，蕴藏着不可遏制的革命力量。
    声明强烈谴责日共宫本修正主义集团充当美日反动派的帮凶，破坏日本革命群众运动的罪行。声明说，正在斗争的紧要关头，日共宫本修正主义集团跳了出来，站在美日反动派一边，大肆叫嚷什么“应当采取秩序井然的行动”，并恶毒地诬蔑爱国学生为“挑衅者”，妄图把日本工人和学生的反美运动引入议会道路的泥沼，使日本人民放弃斗争，这就再一次暴露了宫本修正主义集团的叛徒嘴脸。声明说，我们必须坚决粉碎这些“议会迷”和反革命修正主义分子的破坏活动。
    声明在谈到当前国际上的大好形势时说，震撼全世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命，越南人民的抗美救国斗争，美国黑人的抗暴斗争，法国人民的革命斗争以及全世界人民的反帝风暴，沉重地打击了以美帝为首的世界帝国主义和各国反动派，使它们日益走向没落。
    声明最后说，让我们同中国人民和全世界人民紧密地团结起来，满怀信心地把反美爱国斗争的怒火燃遍全日本。
    日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）也在同一天发表声明，支持福冈市各界人民的反美斗争。
    据新华社十一日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本福冈县爱国工人和学生五百人，今天早晨在北九州市美军军火库附近英勇地截住了为美帝侵越战争运输军火的列车，给予美帝国主义以沉重打击。这是今年初以来福冈县爱国工人和学生以富有战斗性的行动阻止为美军运输军火的第五次斗争。
    今晨，天还没亮，工人和学生就列队前往美国空军山田军火库。七点，在运输军火的列车到达前，他们在从军火库到南小仓车站的铁路轨道上举行了强有力的游行示威。眼看运输军火的列车朝他们开来了，英勇的工人和学生高举红旗，截住了军火列车。示威群众坐在机车前面。有些人登上机车，向司机宣传不要给美帝国主义干事。他们还在列车上贴满了反对美帝的传单。
    示威群众不断高呼：“我们将战斗到把所有美国兵赶出日本为止！”“废除日美‘安全条约’！”“反对美帝侵略越南！”
    一列客车在示威队伍旁边的轨道上驰过。许多乘客向示威队伍招手和鼓掌，表示支持这一反美爱国正义斗争。
    佐藤反动政府为了镇压日本人民的反美爱国运动，在当天下午三点派出一千名武装警察野蛮地镇压示威群众，打伤了数十人和无理逮捕了十人。但是，爱国工人和学生不畏强暴，坚持斗争到下午五点。迫使运输美军军火的列车停驶达十小时之久。（附图片）
