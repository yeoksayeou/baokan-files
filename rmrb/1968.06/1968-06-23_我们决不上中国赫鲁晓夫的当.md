	Editor's Note: The great leader Chairman Mao has called on us: "All those intellectuals who can go to the countryside to work should go there gladly. The countryside is a vast expanse where one can accomplish great things." Tens of thousands of young intellectuals have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call, insisting on the correct direction of going to the mountains and countryside to integrate with workers and peasants, and have made their contributions in the magnificent cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to restore capitalism in China, has been scheming to oppose and sabotage the revolutionary actions of young intellectuals going to the mountains and countryside to integrate with workers and peasants. He has been spreading the idea of "taking a small loss for a big gain" to young intellectuals, and has been peddling the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of "suffering first, enjoying later." The Chinese Khrushchev wants young intellectuals to use "going to the mountains and countryside" as a means to "gain fame and fortune" and "rise in rank and get rich," attempting to lead young intellectuals down the capitalist path.

	Revolutionary young intellectuals across the country have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and have conducted a profound exposure and criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies on the issue of young intellectuals going to the mountains and countryside. Here, we publish some of the critical articles written by some of the young intellectuals who have gone to the mountains and countryside.

	We Will Not Fall for the Tricks of the Chinese Khrushchev

	The integration of intellectuals with the masses of workers and peasants is the broad and smooth path pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao for us young intellectuals, and it is the fundamental way for us young intellectuals to achieve ideological revolutionization. However, the Chinese Khrushchev has been vigorously promoting the path of "gaining fame and fortune" and "rising in rank and getting rich," attempting to disintegrate our revolutionary team that has gone to the mountains and countryside. He has been telling us young intellectuals who have gone to the countryside that: "After going down, you should first participate in agricultural labor, spend three to five years, learn the skills of farming, and get along well with the peasants... and while not neglecting study in production, you can become an official or a scientist in the future." This is a poison that corrupts the souls of young intellectuals who have gone to the countryside.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses; everything should be based on the interests of the people, not on the interests of individuals or small groups." Is it to serve the people wholeheartedly and selflessly, or to put "self" first and personal fame and profit first? This is the dividing line between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and it is also the touchstone to test whether we are true revolutionaries or false revolutionaries. We are revolutionary youths of the Mao Zedong era, and we will act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We participate in agricultural production to revolutionize, to change our thoughts, to build a new socialist countryside, and to change the face of our country from poverty and backwardness, and not to gain political capital for climbing up.

	Looking back on my growth process over the past few years, I deeply feel that the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is constantly going on fiercely. We young revolutionaries who have gone to the countryside rely on the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to constantly eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, and to firmly hold the revolutionary direction.

	In 1962, I responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "integrate with the workers and peasants" and left the city to settle in the countryside. The Chinese Khrushchev saw that I had achieved some results in the countryside and tried every means to scheme against me. In 1964, he dispatched the counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang to our Doujiaqiao Brigade twice to spread poison, attempting to drag me into the quagmire of revisionism. Zhou Yang talked about how important it is to write novels and tried to lure me away from the three great revolutionary movements to write "novels" and strive to be a "literary figure." I firmly replied: "Since the day I went to the countryside, I have not intended to be a 'literary figure'!" I thought: In these years, I and my comrades have set up a people's school, a revolutionary cultural room, a wall newspaper, and compiled propaganda materials for Mao Zedong Thought, which have been very popular among the masses. Are these not important, and is it only writing novels that is important? Especially when we have just come to the countryside, the transformation of our worldview is still far from complete, and there is still a great distance between our thoughts and feelings and those of the poor and lower-middle peasants. How can I leave the fiery three great revolutionary movements to bury my head in writing novels? I also thought about how the poor and lower-middle peasants need us young intellectuals to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. How can I put down this glorious combat mission to strive for personal fame and fortune? I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works. The old man warned us: "Today he integrates himself with the workers and peasants, he is revolutionary; but if he does not integrate tomorrow, or turns to oppress the people, then he is not revolutionary, or he is counter-revolutionary." I decided not to leave the masses for a moment and to walk the path of integrating with the workers and peasants for life.

	The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, and I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's statements on the integration of intellectuals with the masses of workers and peasants. Mao Zedong Thought's microscope allowed me to see through the wolfish ambitions of the Chinese Khrushchev. He is trying to use fame and position as bait to corrupt our loyal hearts to Chairman Mao, making us go astray and become his tools for restoring capitalism. It is truly reactionary to the extreme and shameless to the extreme!

	The bright path of going to the mountains and countryside and integrating with the workers and peasants pointed out by Chairman Mao for us young intellectuals, we will definitely walk on it! The Chinese Khrushchev's plots and tricks will never succeed!

### 我们决不上中国赫鲁晓夫的当

专栏：七亿人民都来做批判家

    编者按　伟大领袖毛主席号召我们：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”成千上万的知识青年，积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚持上山下乡同工农相结合的正确方向，在轰轰烈烈的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，作出了自己的贡献。中国赫鲁晓夫为了在中国复辟资本主义，处心积虑地反对和破坏知识青年上山下乡同工农相结合的革命行动。他向知识青年大肆宣扬“吃小亏，占大便宜”的生意经，极力兜售“先苦后乐”等反革命修正主义货色。中国赫鲁晓夫要知识青年把“上山下乡”作为“成名成家”“升官发财”的手段，妄图把知识青年引上资本主义的邪路。
    广大革命的知识青年高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对中国赫鲁晓夫关于知识青年上山下乡问题的反革命修正主义谬论，进行了深刻的揭露和批判。这里发表的是部分上山下乡知识青年写的批判文章。
    我们决不上中国赫鲁晓夫的当
    河北省宝坻县窦家桥大队知识青年　侯隽
    知识分子与工农群众相结合，这是伟大领袖毛主席给我们知识青年指出的康庄大道，是我们知识青年实现思想革命化的根本途径。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫极力鼓吹“成名成家”“升官发财”之道，妄图瓦解我们这支上山下乡的革命队伍。他对我们下乡知识青年胡说什么：“下去以后，先要去参加农业劳动，花他个三、五年时间，学会了种田本领，和农民搞好关系……加上在生产中不放松学习，将来当干部当科学家。”这是毒害我们下乡知识青年灵魂的腐蚀剂。
    毛主席教导我们：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。是全心全意为人民服务，毫不利己专门利人，还是“私”字当头，个人名利第一？这是区别无产阶级和资产阶级的分水岭，也是检验我们是真革命还是假革命的试金石。我们是毛泽东时代的革命青年，我们就是要按照毛主席的指示办事。我们参加农业生产，是为了革命，为了改造自己的思想，为了建设社会主义新农村，改变我国一穷二白的面貌，而决不是为了捞取向上爬的政治资本。
    回顾自己几年来成长的过程，我深深感到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争无时无刻不在激烈的进行着。我们下乡革命青年就是靠毛泽东思想这一锐利武器，不断地破私立公，坚定革命方向的。
    一九六二年，我响应毛主席“和工农民众相结合”的伟大号召，离开城市，到农村落户。中国赫鲁晓夫见我在农村取得了一些成绩，就千方百计地在我身上打鬼主意。一九六四年，他指派反革命修正主义分子周扬两次来我们窦家桥大队放毒，妄图把我拉入修正主义的泥坑。周扬大谈什么写小说如何重要，极力诱骗我离开三大革命运动去写“小说”，为当“文学家”而奋斗。我坚决地回答：“从下乡那天起，我就不打算当‘文学家’了！”我想：这几年我和同志们一起办民校，办革命文化室，办墙报，编写宣传毛泽东思想的文艺材料，很受群众欢迎，难道这些都不重要，而只有写小说才重要吗？特别是我们到农村不久，世界观的改造还差得很远很远，同贫下中农的思想感情还有很大的距离，我怎么能离开火热的三大革命运动，去埋头写小说呢？我更想到贫下中农那么需要我们知识青年宣传毛泽东思想，我怎么能放下这个光荣的战斗任务，去为个人成名成家而奋斗呢？我反复学习了毛主席著作，他老人家告诫我们：“他今天把自己结合于工农群众，他今天是革命的；但是如果他明天不去结合了，或者反过来压迫老百姓，那就是不革命的，或者是反革命的了。”我决心一刻也不脱离群众，走一辈子与工农群众相结合的道路。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命开始后，我又反复学习了毛主席关于知识分子与工农群众相结合的论述。毛泽东思想的显微镜使我看透了中国赫鲁晓夫的狼子野心。他就是妄图用名利地位作为诱饵，腐蚀我们忠于毛主席的一颗红心，使我们走上歧途，成为他复辟资本主义的工具。真是反动透顶，无耻之极！
    毛主席给我们知识青年指出的上山下乡与工农结合的光明大道，我们走定了！中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋诡计是永远不能得逞的！
