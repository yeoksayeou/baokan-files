Revolutionary workers of the Yinchuan Railway Bureau, with boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, are resolutely implementing the spirit of the national railway and transportation conference. They are firmly grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production, achieving double victories in revolution and production. Currently, the entire bureau is presenting a vibrant and excellent situation in both revolution and production. The class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary workers have reached an unprecedented height, revolutionary enthusiasm is soaring, and production initiative is surging. The revolution is driving production. Compared to the first ten days of May, the average daily loading rate in June has increased by 38.3%, the average daily unloading rate has increased by 37.4%. The vehicle turnover rate has also significantly improved, the transportation order is getting better, and new people and new events are constantly emerging.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The resolutions of higher-level organizations, if they are important, must be quickly conveyed to lower-level organizations and party member masses." The revolutionary committees at various levels of the Yinchuan Railway Bureau, following Chairman Mao's instructions, promptly convened expanded meetings to convey the spirit of the national railway and transportation conference and formulated specific measures to resolutely implement the conference spirit. This ensured that all revolutionary workers in the bureau heard the voice of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, driving the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought to a new high.

When the revolutionary workers heard that Chairman Mao was in excellent health, they were extremely excited. They waved their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Ten thousand years of life to Chairman Mao!" They said: Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin receiving the railway revolutionary worker representatives is our greatest happiness and greatest honor. The national railway and transportation conference, approved by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest encouragement, greatest education, and greatest motivation for us. We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, grasp the revolution firmly, and vigorously promote production. We will complete and overfulfill the transportation production tasks with practical actions to answer Chairman Mao's concern and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the revolutionary workers have carried forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, advancing steadily and decisively striking down a handful of class enemies. They have exposed a handful of traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionary elements who have long been hiding in the railway system, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses and thoroughly crushing the arrogance of the class enemies. They have also deeply carried out revolutionary criticism and organized bitter-sweet remembrance activities, thereby deepening their understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, further igniting their boundless love for Chairman Mao, and intensifying their hatred for Liu Shaoqi. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers is unprecedentedly high, driving the revolution and production to develop vigorously.

    银川铁路分局革命生产形势越来越好
    据新华社银川电　银川铁路分局广大革命职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的心情，坚决贯彻全国铁路、交通会议精神，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺得了革命和生产的双胜利。目前，全分局革命和生产呈现一派生气勃勃的大好形势。广大革命职工阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高，革命斗志昂扬，生产积极性高涨。革命推动了生产。六月上旬和五月上旬相比，每日平均装车率提高百分之三十八点三，每日平均卸车率提高百分之三十七点四。车辆周转率也有很大提高，运输秩序越来越好，新人新事不断出现。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“上级机关的决议，凡属重要一点的，必须迅速地传达到下级机关和党员群众中去。”银川铁路分局的各级革命委员会，遵循毛主席的这一教导，及时召开扩大会议，传达全国铁路、交通会议精神，并且订出了坚决贯彻会议精神的具体措施。使全分局的革命职工都听到了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的声音，推动全分局活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现了新高潮。
    当广大革命职工听到毛主席身体非常非常健康时，大家非常激动。他们挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”他们说：毛主席和林副主席接见铁路革命职工代表，是我们的最大幸福，最大光荣。全国铁路、交通会议，是毛主席、林副主席亲自批准召开的，这是毛主席对我们的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大教育，最大鞭策。我们坚决听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，狠抓革命，猛促生产，以完成和超额完成运输生产任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的实际行动，来回答毛主席的关怀。
    广大革命职工遵照毛主席的教导，发扬“不到长城非好汉”的无产阶级彻底革命精神，乘胜前进，稳、准、狠地坚决打击一小撮阶级敌人，揪出了长期隐藏在铁路系统的一小撮叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风。他们还深入开展革命大批判，组织忆苦思甜活动，从而更加深了对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的理解，进一步激发了对毛主席的无限热爱，增强了对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨。广大革命职工革命热情的空前高涨，推动了革命和生产蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。
