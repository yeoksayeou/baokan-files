Edition: 2

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out more than forty years ago: "The main force that has been struggling and fighting in the countryside is the poor peasants. ... Their revolutionary direction has never been wrong." They are the "revolutionary vanguards." Yan Xiechong, an old poor peasant from Tangzhu Brigade, Xiaosong Commune, Lankao County, Henan Province, is a representative of the thousands and tens of thousands of "revolutionary vanguards" in the Chinese countryside.

For twenty years, Yan Xiechong has followed our great leader Chairman Mao closely and played a full role as a revolutionary vanguard in the great struggle to build a new socialist countryside. During the land reform, he stepped forward and took on the role of the village committee chairman, actively leading the poor and lower-middle peasants to fight the landlords and distribute the land, thoroughly overturning the feudal system that had lasted for thousands of years. During the period of agricultural cooperation, he took the lead and became the head of the mutual aid team, following the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, and unyieldingly walking the socialist path. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he fought bravely at the forefront of the class struggle, with the great revolutionary spirit of "daring to be skinned alive, daring to pull the emperor off his horse," leading and uniting the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to launch a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and resolutely defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

"The eyes of the peasants are never wrong"

In 1966, the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution suddenly swept across the land of Lankao. The 380,000 revolutionary people of Lankao, under the great call of Chairman Mao, threw themselves into this political revolution under socialist conditions. A handful of capitalist roaders within the old county committee, panic-stricken, hurriedly manipulated some social dregs to deceive a part of the masses, shifting the target and directing the spearhead of the struggle against the revolutionary cadre Zhang Qingli.

At that time, Yan Xiechong was studying in the county. Seeing this situation, he immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Communist Party members must ask 'why' about everything." He pondered repeatedly: Zhang Qingli comrade listens to Chairman Mao, resolutely walks the socialist path. Following the footsteps of Comrade Jiao Yulu, he enters the doors of the poor and lower-middle peasants, eats with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and does the work of the poor and lower-middle peasants. He is a good cadre who stands on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Why do some people want to label him as a "political thief"? Yan Xiechong thought and thought, and Chairman Mao's teachings rang in his ears again: "After the enemies with guns have been eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us." Yes, it must be the class enemies playing tricks. Who are the class enemies? After analyzing and comparing the several power-holders within the old county committee, Yan Xiechong focused his attention on the first secretary Zhou XX. This guy, following the baton of the Chinese Khrushchev, fiercely opposed the poor and lower-middle peasants in studying Chairman Mao's works, maliciously slandering Chairman Mao's good student Comrade Jiao Yulu, and trying every means to push the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the countryside of Lankao ...

"The eyes of the peasants are never wrong. Who is good, who is bad ... the peasants have a very clear calculation." Yan Xiechong saw through the tricks of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Lankao County Committee and immediately realized: This is a fierce class struggle, a national affair, and it must be dealt with. It cannot be allowed for the capitalist roaders to seize the political power of the proletariat! He decided to return to the commune and mobilize the poor and lower-middle peasants to rebel against the capitalist roaders.

As soon as he returned to the village, Yan Xiechong immediately convened a meeting of the poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade, speaking at length about the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and exposing the evil plots of the capitalist roaders in the county. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Tangzhu Brigade were quickly mobilized and organized, and under the leadership of Yan Xiechong, they joined the battle to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The poor and lower-middle peasant teams of other communes also organized spontaneously, forming a vast army of peasant revolutionary rebels — the "Lankao Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Defense Jiao Rebel Headquarters." Yan Xiechong was elected as the deputy commander. They joined forces with other revolutionary mass organizations to engage in a life-and-death struggle with the capitalist roaders.

"Revolution is not afraid of death, afraid of death is not revolutionary"

The clear stance and invincible spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants frightened the handful of capitalist roaders in Lankao. They gathered in dark corners, studying new counter-revolutionary strategies, attempting to use "sugar-coated bullets" to disintegrate the revolutionary ranks, first trying to pull the old poor peasant Yan Xiechong down.

One day, a confidant of the capitalist roaders came to see Yan Xiechong, hypocritically taking out fifteen yuan from his pocket and saying, "Old Yan, go home! What do you know? What is revolution!" Yan Xiechong glared at him, pushing him away roughly and scolding, "Get out of here! Do you think you can buy me with money?! Not to mention fifteen yuan, even if you brought a trainload, I wouldn't see it. I only see Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" Yan Xiechong's powerful words expressed the boundless loyalty of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants to Chairman Mao and their deep hatred for all class enemies.

The "sugar-coated bullets" of the capitalist roaders failed in front of the poor and lower-middle peasants; the party, government, and financial and cultural powers usurped by the capitalist roaders were seized back by the revolutionary masses of Lankao. However, this handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders, colluding with the capitalist roaders within the old prefectural and provincial committees, launched a counter-revolutionary restoration tide, fiercely counterattacking. They reversed black and white, confused right and wrong, implemented white terror, and carried out large-scale arrests and suppression of the revolutionary masses. Yan Xiechong was also tied up and locked away.

"All reactionaries are paper tigers." Yan Xiechong did not put the persecution of the capitalist roaders in his eyes. With the determination to fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and die for it, he waged a tenacious struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line.

The confidants of the capitalist roaders questioned him fiercely: "Why do you want to be an 'old conservative'?" Yan Xiechong replied firmly: "I am defending Chairman Mao, the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and the socialist mountains and rivers. I defended it in the past, I will defend it in the future, I will defend it to the end, I will defend it for life!"

"Why do you hold 'black meetings'?" Yan Xiechong replied with ridicule and sarcasm: "We poor and lower-middle peasants respond to Chairman Mao's great call to 'grasp revolution, promote production.' We are busy working during the day and can only hold meetings after dark."

After questioning for a long time, they gained nothing. The capitalist roaders left in defeat.

Yan Xiechong used the place where he was locked up as a battlefield for persistent struggle, encouraging his comrades in the revolutionary ranks who were arrested together: "They arrest us, what's the big deal? We revolutionaries are not afraid of death, afraid of death is not revolutionary. Our heads can be cut off, our blood can flow, but we cannot abandon Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" He always said with full confidence: "Chairman Mao is in Beijing, his heart is with us poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao, he is firmly supporting us. Chairman Mao said: 'Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If you deny them, you deny the revolution. If you strike them, you strike the revolution. Their revolutionary direction has never been wrong.' We listen to Chairman Mao's words, rebel against the capitalist roaders, and the final victory will definitely be ours!"

Under the encouragement and leadership of Yan Xiechong, the revolutionary comrades who suffered with him were all spirited and full of fighting spirit, continuously foiling the tricks of the capitalist roaders.

Seeing that Yan Xiechong's "destructiveness" was great, the capitalist roaders wanted to use soft methods to persuade him to "surrender." They pretended to be concerned, sending a confidant to give Yan Xiechong a quilt. "You are old, here is a quilt for you. Sigh, when people get old, their minds become confused ..." Yan Xiechong did not let him finish, immediately interrupting his words. He said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun, shining brightly in my heart. You are the ones who are confused for not following Chairman Mao!" The man did not give up, saying: "For the sake of you being a representative of the poor peasants' association, write a self-criticism, apologize, and you will be released." Yan Xiechong replied firmly: "I am guiltless in defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" The confidant of the capitalist roaders, seeing that soft methods were ineffective, suddenly changed his face and threatened: "Yan Xiechong! Do you want to live or die? You are still stubborn, and you will be tortured!" Yan Xiechong smiled contemptuously and said indifferently: "Even if you put a knife to my neck, I will still stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, never changing my heart!"

Hard methods were used to the extreme; soft methods were used to the end. The capitalist roaders had no choice but to send Yan Xiechong back to the commune for "reflection."

"Loyal to Chairman Mao, never changing heart"

Yan Xiechong was sent back to the commune from the county. The bad head of the conservative organization thought that Yan Xiechong, who had been tortured for many days, had surrendered, and asked proudly: "How was your reflection in the county? How was your study? Have you thought it through now?" Yan Xiechong looked at him and smiled meaningfully, saying: "The 'study' in the county was quite good, and I saw the two-line struggle more clearly!"

The bad head heard this and thought that Yan Xiechong's views had "changed," saying: "Good! Good! Let's have a meeting, and you apologize to everyone!"

At the so-called "apology" meeting, despite being weakened by many days of torture, Yan Xiechong immediately felt a boundless strength when he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on "making up your mind, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." He believed that the poor and lower-middle peasants would stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and he believed that the deceived masses would awaken. He first led everyone to study Chairman Mao's quotations and then said loudly: "This time I studied very well! I saw it more clearly! Those they arrested are all our poor and lower-middle peasants ..." The bad head heard this and asked angrily: "You have been reflecting for so many days, reflecting on what! Why are you still not willing to give up?" Yan Xiechong replied firmly: "It's true, I am not willing to give up! My family of three generations begged for food and worked for the landlords. The old society killed five of my relatives. It was Chairman Mao who led me to make a revolution and established the socialist mountains and rivers. Now, the Chinese Khrushchev wants the poor and lower-middle peasants to go back on their path and suffer again. I am not willing to give up!" Every word was bitter, every sentence was filled with hatred. A speech moved the poor and lower-middle peasants and the deceived masses present to tears. Seeing that things were not going well, the bad head hurriedly stopped his speech, asking him to "express his attitude, what to do in the future?" Yan Xiechong replied firmly: "Loyal to Chairman Mao, never changing heart!" He raised his head and sang "The East Is Red," striding out of the venue, making the handful of class enemies look miserable, and uniting the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the deceived masses around him.

In that extremely difficult environment, Yan Xiechong never stopped struggling. He often avoided the surveillance of the capitalist roaders and bad heads with his eldest daughter (the person in charge of the "Defense Jiao Brigade"), using the opportunities of labor, visiting relatives, and visiting neighbors to mobilize the masses with the active elements, exposing the evil plots of the class enemies. The revolutionary ranks of the poor and lower-middle peasants became stronger and stronger. In July 1967, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line finally achieved decisive victory in Lankao and established a new revolutionary power — the Lankao County Revolutionary Committee — five months later.

"National affairs, I must manage to the end"

Yan Xiechong, who had walked out of the dark old society into the new society illuminated by the red sun, had a firm stance and clear hatred. He remembered Chairman Mao's great kindness in saving the poor from the pit of fire, followed Chairman Mao closely on the socialist path, and always put national affairs in his heart. As long as it was beneficial to socialism, he took the lead to do it; if it was not beneficial to socialism, he stood up to manage it, no matter how great the difficulties, he never retreated. In 1962, the single farming wind blown by the Chinese Khrushchev reached Lankao. Taking advantage of Yan Xiechong's absence, the class enemies of the production team incited some community members with serious capitalist thoughts, according to the so-called "higher-level instructions," to divide more than forty mu of collective farmland. Yan Xiechong returned and immediately stopped it firmly. He said to the community members who agreed to divide the land: "Chairman Mao let us walk the cooperative path. This division of land to households is what path? This is the path back! We poor and lower-middle peasants absolutely cannot walk it!" Someone opposed, saying: "Dividing land is a 'higher-level instruction,' who dares not to execute it?" Yan Xiechong said angrily: "What 'higher-level instruction'?! Anyway, Chairman Mao did not let us do this, we will not execute it! If they insist on dividing the land, I will go to Beijing to find Chairman Mao! This is a national affair, I must manage it to the end!" The socialist righteousness rose, and the capitalist evil was suppressed. The plot of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents to restore capitalism in the countryside of Tangzhu was shamefully defeated under the firm resistance of Yan Xiechong and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

The practice of revolutionary struggle made this old poor peasant believe in Chairman Mao more and more deeply and follow Chairman Mao more and more closely. Although he was illiterate, he studied Chairman Mao's works very seriously. He said: "If I don't eat for a day, it's okay; if I take a step away from Chairman Mao's books, it's not okay." He forgot to sleep and eat, studied hard, and always carried "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Constantly Read Articles" with him. When he saw someone who could read, he would ask. Sometimes if he couldn't remember a sentence, he would sit up at midnight and recite it until he memorized it. He often said to the poor and lower-middle peasants: "Without Chairman Mao, there would be no poor and lower-middle peasants; with Chairman Mao, we have today. Whether to read Chairman Mao's books, whether to listen to Chairman Mao's words, whether to be loyal to Chairman Mao, this is a big deal, and it cannot be vague at all."

"For the oppressed people all over the world to be liberated"

Yan Xiechong fought for the revolution to the point of selflessness. He often said: "I am not for personal eating and drinking, nor am I for my own family to have a good life. I am for the country not to change color, for the oppressed people all over the world to be liberated." He was exactly what Chairman Mao said, "a person of high moral character, a person of pure character, a person of virtue, a person who has transcended low-level interests, a person who benefits the people." He was selfless and dedicated to others; he had a heart for the country and eyes for the world, regarding the liberation of all mankind as his lifelong mission. Although he himself was not rich, as soon as he heard that a neighboring production team was in difficulty, he would immediately help generously. When the livestock of Juzhuang Brigade had no feed, he sent them more than a thousand jin of dry grass from his own home; to support the fifth team in buying potato seedlings, he sold his sheep and sent the money forward; on rainy days, when the military dependents and the five guarantees households had difficulty carrying water, he would go door to door to carry water for them; when any poor and lower-middle peasant family had difficulties, he would save and help them. Therefore, the masses called him the confidant of the poor and lower-middle peasants and a good comrade like Jiao Yulu.

Even under the cruel persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line, he did not forget the anti-American frontline fighters, the class brothers of Vietnam. At that time, his entire family was labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," and his one-year-old son Yan Baoguo was also labeled as a "counter-revolutionary lamb." Due to the control and persecution of the capitalist roaders, Yan Xiechong's family had no rice and no firewood, and his young son was very ill. Someone advised him: "Old Yan, you are over fifty, and you have only one son. Eat the wheat you have stored at home!"

The story of this wheat is touching. In the spring of 1965, Yan Xiechong went to Zhengzhou to participate in the provincial poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives' conference and visited the "Exhibition of U.S. Imperialist Crimes in Vietnam." He saw the photos of the class brothers in South Vietnam being massacred, and he was so sad that he shed tears. When he returned home, he immediately convened a family meeting and decided to save two liang of grain per person per day to support Vietnam. From then on, they ate more coarse food, less fine food, more vegetables, and less grain, saving more than two hundred jin of wheat in one wheat season, preparing to find an opportunity to send it to Vietnam. He pasted a red paper note on the grain jar, writing "Reserve Grain to Support Vietnam," and made three rules for the whole family, that no one was allowed to use the grain in this jar.

Now, his young son is very ill, what should he do? Yan Xiechong was afraid that his wife would waver, so he tried to say: "The child is not doing well, let's grind some wheat to nourish him." His wife heard this and immediately got angry, saying angrily: "Why are you changing your mind again? You should care about national affairs and not just the child." He heard this and smiled satisfactorily. He and the whole family thought: The child's illness is a small matter, supporting Vietnam's anti-American struggle is a big matter. No matter how difficult it is, this grain cannot be used. Moving a grain of wheat would be disloyal to Chairman Mao and disloyal to the Vietnamese brothers who are fighting bravely.

In this way, no matter how difficult it was, his family never touched a grain of wheat in the jar. The more than two hundred jin of "Reserve Grain to Support Vietnam" is still well preserved in the jar.

Now, Yan Xiechong is a representative of the Henan Province Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association, a member of the Lankao County Revolutionary Committee, and a leader of the Tangzhu Brigade leadership team. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Lankao affectionately call him "Our Representative Yan." After being elected as a representative of the masses into the revolutionary committee, Yan Xiechong always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on "making sure that comrades continue to maintain the style of being modest, prudent, and unassuming, and making sure that comrades continue to maintain the style of hard struggle." He worked diligently and conscientiously. He consulted with the masses on everything and mingled with the masses. When he went to the county for meetings or gave reports to comrades from other places for study and observation, as long as the situation was not urgent, he would go back and forth on foot. He did not change his old poor peasant style at all, insisting on participating in collective production labor. Even when he was at a meeting in the county, he was still concerned about the production of the commune and brigade. As soon as the meeting was over, he would immediately return to the commune, lead production, and participate in labor.

Recently, Yan Xiechong has been learning from Comrade Men He, determined to be like Comrade Men He, "thinking of Chairman Mao in everything, serving Chairman Mao in everything, following Chairman Mao closely in everything, and doing everything for Chairman Mao," to be a revolutionary vanguard for life.

    革命先锋
    ——记兰考县小宋公社唐寨大队老贫农阎协崇
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在四十多年前就强调指出：“乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农”，“他们的革命大方向始终没有错”，他们是“革命先锋”。河南省兰考县小宋公社唐寨大队的老贫农阎协崇，就是我国农村中千千万万“革命先锋”的一个代表。
    二十年来，阎协崇紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，在建设社会主义新农村的伟大斗争中，充分发挥了革命先锋的作用。土改时，他挺身而出，担任农会组长，积极带动贫下中农斗地主、分田地，把千年的封建制度狠狠踏翻在地。农业合作化时期，他一马当先，担任互助组长，和贫下中农一起，沿着毛主席指出的方向，百折不挠地走社会主义道路。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，他英勇奋斗在阶级斗争的最前列，以“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏的革命精神，带领和团结广大贫下中农，大造党内一小撮走资派的反，坚决捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    “农民的眼睛，全然没有错的”
    一九六六年，无产阶级文化大革命的暴风骤雨，迅猛异常地降临到兰考大地。三十八万兰考革命人民，在毛主席的伟大号召下，投入了这场在社会主义条件下的政治大革命。旧县委内的一小撮走资派，惊恐万状，急急忙忙操纵一些社会渣滓，蒙蔽一部分群众，转移目标，把斗争矛头指向革命领导干部张钦礼同志。
    当时，阎协崇正在县里学习。看到这种情况，他立刻想起了毛主席的教导：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么”。他反复思忖：张钦礼同志听毛主席的话，坚决走社会主义道路。他沿着焦裕禄同志的脚印，进的是贫下中农的门，吃的是贫下中农的饭，办的是贫下中农的事，是站在毛主席革命路线上的好干部。为什么有人要把他打成“政治大扒手”呢？阎协崇想着想着，毛主席的教导又在耳边响起：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争”。对！一定是阶级敌人在捣鬼。阶级敌人是谁呢？阎协崇分析对比了旧县委内的几个当权派之后，便把注意力集中到第一书记周××身上。这个家伙死跟着中国赫鲁晓夫的指挥棒打转转，疯狂反对贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作，恶毒污蔑毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志，千方百计在兰考农村推行反革命修正主义路线，……
    “农民的眼睛，全然没有错的。谁个劣，谁个不劣，……农民都有极明白的计算”。阎协崇看穿了兰考县委内一小撮走资派的阴谋诡计，心里立刻明白过来：这是一场激烈的阶级大搏斗，这是国家大事，一定要管，决不能让走资派专了无产阶级的政！他决定赶回公社发动贫下中农起来造走资派的反。
    一回到村里，阎协崇马上召开了大队贫下中农大会，大讲毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，大揭县里走资派的恶毒阴谋。唐寨大队的贫下中农迅速动员起来，组织起来，在阎协崇带领下，投入捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的战斗，其他公社的贫下中农队伍也不约而同地组织起来，结成了一支浩浩荡荡的农民革命造反大军——“兰考贫下中农卫焦造反司令部”。阎协崇当选为副主任。他们和其他革命群众组织联合起来，同走资派展开了一场你死我活的斗争。
    “革命不怕死，怕死不革命”
    贫下中农爱憎分明的立场和所向无敌的气概，吓破了兰考一小撮走资派的胆。他们麕集在阴暗的角落里，研究新的反革命策略，妄图用“糖衣炮弹”瓦解革命队伍，首先想把老贫农阎协崇拉下水去。
    一天，走资派的一个亲信假惺惺地来看阎协崇。他一边从兜里掏出十五元钱，一边说：“老阎啊，回家去吧！你们懂个啥？啥叫革命！”阎协崇瞪圆了大眼，一把推开了他，粗重无情地斥责说：“滚你的蛋！想用钱收买俺哪？！不要说十五元，你就是开来一火车，俺也看不见，俺就看得见毛主席的无产阶级革命路线！”阎协崇铿锵有力的话，表达了千千万万贫下中农对毛主席的无限忠诚，对一切阶级敌人的无比仇恨。
    走资派的糖衣炮弹，在贫下中农面前失灵了；走资派篡夺的党政财文大权，被兰考无产阶级革命派一举夺回来了。可是，这一小撮死不悔改的走资派，又勾结旧地委和旧省委内的走资派，掀起一股反革命复辟逆流，猖狂地反扑过来。他们颠倒黑白，混淆是非，实行白色恐怖，对无产阶级革命派进行了大逮捕、大镇压。阎协崇也被绳捆索绑，关了起来。
    “一切反动派都是纸老虎”。阎协崇根本不把走资派的迫害放在眼里，他以生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗、死为毛主席的革命路线而献身的决心，同资产阶级反动路线展开了顽强的斗争。
    走资派的亲信们恶狠狠地审问他：“你为啥要当‘老保’？”阎协崇斩钉截铁地答道：“俺保的是毛主席，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是社会主义的江山。过去保，今后保，一保到底，保一辈子！”
    “你为啥开‘黑会’？”阎协崇连讽带刺地说：“俺贫下中农响应毛主席‘抓革命，促生产’的伟大号召，白天干活没空，总是天黑了才开会。”
    问了半天，一无所获。走资派灰溜溜地失败而去。
    阎协崇把被关的地方作为坚持斗争的阵地，时时鼓励一起被抓起来的无产阶级革命派战友：“他们逮捕咱们，没啥了不起。咱们革命不怕死，怕死不革命。头可断，血可流，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线不能丢！”他总是满怀信心地说：“毛主席在北京，心里是想着咱兰考贫下中农的，他老人家是坚决支持咱们的。毛主席说：‘没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。他们的革命大方向始终没有错。’咱们听毛主席的话，造走资派的反，最后胜利一定是咱们的！”
    在阎协崇的鼓励和带动下，和他患难与共的无产阶级革命派战士个个精神振奋，斗志昂扬，接连挫败了走资派的阴谋诡计。
    一小撮走资派看阎协崇的“破坏性”很大，就想用软办法劝他“投降”。他们装着关心的样子，派亲信给阎协崇送来了一条被子。“你上岁数了，给你条被子。唉，人一老，头脑就昏了……”阎协崇没等他说完，立刻打断了来人的话。他说：“毛泽东思想是红太阳，照得俺心里亮堂堂。你们不跟毛主席走，才是昏了！”那人没有死心，又说：“看在你是贫协代表的面上，写个检讨，请请罪，就放你回去。”阎协崇坚定地回答：“俺保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无罪！”走资派的亲信见来软的无效，突然变脸威胁说：“阎协崇！你想死想活？你再硬，就上刑！”阎协崇卑视地笑了笑，毫不在乎地说：“你就是把刀架到俺脖子上，俺还是要站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，一辈子不变心！”
    硬的，施尽了；软的，用绝了。走资派实在没法，只得把阎协崇“送回公社反省”。
    “忠于毛主席，永远不变心”
    阎协崇从县城被押回到公社。保守组织的坏头头以为受尽折磨的阎协崇屈服了，得意洋洋地问道：“你在县里反省得咋样？学习得咋样？现在可想通了吧！”阎协崇看着他发笑，意味深长地说：“在县里‘学习’得怪好，对两条路线斗争可看清了！”坏头头一听，以为他的观点“变”了，连说：“那好！那好！开个会，你给大家请个罪吧！”
    在所谓“请罪”的大会上，经过许多天折磨的阎协崇尽管浑身无力，但是一想起毛主席关于“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，立即感到有无穷的力量。他坚信贫下中农会站在毛主席的革命路线一边，坚信受蒙蔽的群众会觉悟过来。他首先领着大家学习毛主席语录，然后大声地说：“我这次学习得可好了！看得更清楚了！他们逮捕的尽是咱贫下中农……”坏头头一听，气急败坏地质问阎协崇：“你反省这些天啦，反省个啥！怎么还是死不甘心？”阎协崇坚定地说：“不假，俺就是死不甘心！俺一家三代逃荒要饭，给地主种地扛活，旧社会害死了俺五口亲人。是毛主席领导俺闹革命，打下了社会主义江山。现在中国赫鲁晓夫要让贫下中农走回头路，吃二遍苦，俺就是死不甘心！”字字辛酸泪，句句血泪仇，一席话，说得到会的贫下中农和受蒙蔽的群众痛哭流涕。坏头头一见不妙，慌得连忙止住他的发言，要他“表表态，今后咋办？”阎协崇坚定地回答：“忠于毛主席，永远不变心！”他昂头高唱《东方红》，大步走出会场，把一小撮阶级敌人摆弄得狼狈不堪，从而把广大贫下中农和受蒙蔽的群众团结到自己的周围。
    在那十分艰苦的环境下，阎协崇一刻也没有停止过斗争。他经常和大女儿（大队“卫焦兵团”负责人）避开走资派和坏头头的监视，利用劳动、串亲、访邻的机会，和积极分子一起到处发动群众，揭露阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋。贫下中农的革命队伍越来越壮大。一九六七年七月间，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线终于在兰考取得了决定性胜利，并在五个月之后建立了新生的革命政权——兰考县革命委员会。
    “国家大事，俺一定要管到底”
    从暗无天日的旧社会走进红太阳照耀的新社会的阎协崇，立场坚定，爱憎分明。他牢记毛主席把穷人从火坑里救出来的伟大恩情，紧跟毛主席走社会主义大道，时时刻刻把国家大事放在自己的心上。只要有利于社会主义的，他就带头去干；不利于社会主义的，他就挺身来管，任凭遇到天大的困难，毫不退缩。一九六二年，中国赫鲁晓夫煽起的单干风刮到了兰考。生产队的阶级敌人趁着阎协崇外出之机，怂恿一部分资本主义思想严重的社员，按照所谓“上级指示”，把四十多亩集体耕地分了。阎协崇回来后，立刻坚决制止。他对同意分地的社员说：“毛主席让走合作化道路，这分田到户是啥道路？这是回头路！咱贫下中农绝对不能走！”有人反对说：“分地是‘上级指示’，谁敢不执行？”阎协崇气愤地说：“啥‘上级指示’？！反正毛主席没让咱这么干，咱们就是不执行！他们硬要叫分地，俺就上北京去找毛主席！这是国家大事，俺一定要管到底！”社会主义的正气升上来，资本主义的邪气压下去。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在唐寨一带农村复辟资本主义的阴谋，在阎协崇和广大贫下中农坚决抵制下，可耻地破产了。
    革命斗争的实践，使这位老贫农信仰毛主席越来越深，跟随毛主席越来越紧。他虽然一字不识，但是非常认真地学习毛主席著作。他说：“我一天不吃饭，中；一步离了毛主席的书，就不中。”他废寝忘食，刻苦学习，身上经常带着《毛主席语录》和“老三篇”，见了识字的人就问。有时候一句话记不住，半夜里还坐起来默念，直到完全背会为止。他经常对贫下中农说：“没有毛主席，就没有咱贫下中农；有了毛主席，咱们才有今天。读不读毛主席的书，听不听毛主席的话，对毛主席忠不忠，这是天大的事，半点也含糊不得。”“为了天下受压迫的人民都解放”
    阎协崇为革命苦战奋斗，达到了忘我的境界。他常说：“俺不是为个人吃喝，也不是为自己家里能过好日子，俺是为了国家不变颜色，为了天下受压迫的人民都解放。”他正是毛主席所说的那样“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”他毫不利己，专门利人；他胸怀祖国，放眼世界，把解放全人类当作自己毕生的事业。虽然他自己也不宽裕，但一听到邻近生产队有困难，就立即慷慨相助。朱梁庄大队的牲口没有饲料，他就送去自家的上千斤干草；为了支援五队买红薯秧，他卖掉自己的羊把钱送上前去；下雨天军属、五保户担水困难，他就挨门逐户把水挑好；哪家贫下中农生活困难，他就省吃俭用地接济他们。因此，群众都称他是贫下中农的贴心人、焦裕禄式的好同志。
    就在遭到资产阶级反动路线残酷迫害的情况下，他仍然没有忘记反美斗争前线的越南阶级兄弟。当时，他的全家都被打成了“反革命”，连不满一周岁的小儿子阎保国，也被打成了“反革命羔”。由于走资派的控制、迫害，阎协崇家里少米无柴，小儿子病得十分厉害。有人劝他：“老阎呀，你五十多岁了，就那么一个根儿，把家里存的那些麦子吃了吧！”
    提起这麦子，有一段感人肺腑的故事。一九六五年春，阎协崇到郑州参加省贫下中农代表大会，参观了“美帝侵越罪行展览”。他看了越南南方阶级兄弟惨遭杀戮的照片，难过得流下了眼泪。回到家里，他立刻召开家庭会议，决定每人每天节约二两粮食，支援越南。从此，他们多吃粗，少吃细，多吃菜，少吃粮，一个麦季就省下二百多斤小麦，准备找机会寄到越南去。他在粮缸上贴了张红纸条，上写“支援越南储备粮”，并给全家约法三章，任何人不准动用这个缸里的粮。
    现在小儿子病得厉害，怎么办？阎协崇怕老伴动摇，就试探着说：“小孩不行了，磨点麦养养吧。”那知道老伴一听，立刻火了，气冲冲地说：“你咋又变卦啦？要关心国家大事，不能只顾小孩。”他听后满意地笑了。他和全家人都认为：孩子有病是小事，支援越南抗美救国是大事，再困难，这些粮食不能动用。动一个麦粒就对不起毛主席，对不起正在英勇奋战的越南兄弟。
    就这样，无论多么困难，他全家从未动过缸里的一粒麦籽。那二百多斤“支援越南储备粮”，直到现在还好好地存放在缸里。
    现在，阎协崇是河南省贫下中农协会的代表、兰考县革命委员会的委员、唐寨大队领导班子的负责人。兰考广大贫下中农亲切地称呼他为“俺们的阎代表”。阎协崇作为群众的代表被选入革命委员会后，时时牢记毛主席关于“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的教导，勤勤恳恳地工作。他遇事和群众商量，和群众打成一片。他到县里开会或给外地参观学习的同志作报告，只要情况不急，就步行来往。他丝毫不改老贫农的本色，坚持参加集体生产劳动。即使在县里开会时，他心里也挂念着公社和大队的生产。会一开完，他就立刻走回公社，领导生产，参加劳动。
    最近，阎协崇又在向门合同志学习，决心象门合同志那样“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席”，当一辈子革命先锋。
