	Turn Evaluation and Award Meetings into Battlefields for Self-Criticism and Criticism of Revisionism
	Zhao Wujun, Director of the Technical Research Room of a Certain Factory

	The Chinese Khrushchev has always opposed emphasizing proletarian politics, advocating the "initiative of enterprises" and the need for an "award system." His agents have been vigorously promoting a material reward system in our enterprises, implementing various "overproduction awards," "safety awards," "economy awards," "propaganda awards," "year-end awards," "competition awards," and "innovation awards," among others. They aim to "motivate" the broad masses of workers by turning human relationships into naked monetary relations.

	We, the working class, are the most far-sighted, selfless, and revolutionary. We will not work for awards, for money, or for personal gain. We will resolutely repel the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie. In August 1966, driven by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we established the Technical Research Room. Everyone is deeply loyal to Chairman Mao, using the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as our weapon to fiercely criticize the economicism promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. We abolished the award system, turning the monthly evaluation and award meetings into sessions for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and for self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. Each session of self-criticism and criticism of revisionism is a cannon shot aimed at the Chinese Khrushchev. Young worker Jing Junjie, when he first came to the Technical Research Room, had many selfish thoughts. With the help of his comrades, he studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" deeply, sparking a revolution in his soul. He voluntarily transformed his worldview, seeking neither fame nor wealth, dedicating himself entirely to revolutionary technological innovation. Together with his mentor, he successfully developed the cross-needle machine, increasing work efficiency by more than onefold. This is a strong refutation of the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of using material incentives to motivate workers' "enthusiasm."

	The more self-criticism and criticism of revisionism sessions we hold, the more we love Chairman Mao and the more we hate the Chinese Khrushchev. Everyone's thoughts and efforts are united, working together to seize the revolution and promote production, adding luster to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Comrades work tirelessly, thinking about ideas day and night. Some run to the workshop as soon as they get an idea, immediately conducting experiments. Others drop their chopsticks and start working on their ideas right at the dining table. After a year of hard work, we successfully developed 26 projects of automated and semi-automated sewing machines, paving a new path for the automation of clothing production. Where does this strength come from? Workers firmly say, "It is the thought reform that leads to the automation of sewing machines." With the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, we can create any miracle in the world.

	The Chinese Khrushchev foolishly thinks that a few pieces of stinking money can buy the red hearts of the working class that serve the people. This is a pipe dream!

### 变评奖会为斗私批修的战场

    变评奖会为斗私批修的战场
    某厂技术研究室指导员　赵武俊
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯反对突出无产阶级政治，胡说要发挥“企业的积极性”，“要有奖励制度”。他的代理人极力在我们的企业里推行物质奖励制度，大搞什么“超产奖”、“安全奖”、“节约奖”、“宣传奖”、“年终奖”、“竞赛奖”、“革新奖”等五花八门的奖，来“调动”广大职工的“生产积极性”，企图把人和人的关系变成赤裸裸的金钱关系。
    我们“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”决不为奖干活，为钱干活，为私干活，坚决打退资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻。一九六六年八月，在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，我们成立技术研究室。大家无限忠于毛主席，以“老三篇”为武器，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的经济主义，取消奖励制度，把每月的评奖会变成了活学活用毛主席著作、斗私批修讲用会。每开一次斗私批修讲用会，就是射向中国赫鲁晓夫一颗炮弹。青年工人景俊杰，刚来技术研究室时，存在着私心杂念。他在同志们的帮助下，大学“老三篇”，在灵魂深处爆发革命，自觉地改造世界观，不图名，不图利，全心全意为革命搞技术革新。他和老师傅一起试制成功了十字针机，工效提高一倍以上。这给中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的用物质刺激调动工人“积极性”的谬论当头一棒。
    斗私批修讲用会，越开越对毛主席爱，越开越对中国赫鲁晓夫恨。大家心往一处想，劲往一处使，齐心协力抓革命，促生产，为无产阶级文化大革命增光。同志们废寝忘食，朝思暮想。有的走路时想出点子，撒腿就往车间跑，立即进行试验。有的吃饭时想出点子，马上放下饭碗，在饭桌上摆开阵势。经过一年的艰苦奋斗，终于试制成功自动化和半自动化缝纫机二十六个项目，为被服生产自动化闯出了一条崭新的道路。这种力量从哪里来的呢？工人们坚定地说：“是有了思想革命化，才有缝纫机自动化。”有了光焰无际的毛泽东思想的武装，什么人间奇迹都能创造。
    中国赫鲁晓夫妄想用几个臭钱，来收买我们工人阶级一颗为人民服务的红心，这是痴心梦想！
