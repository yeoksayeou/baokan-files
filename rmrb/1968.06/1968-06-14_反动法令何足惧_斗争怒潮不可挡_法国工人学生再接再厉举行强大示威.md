The reactionary decree is nothing to fear; the waves of struggle are irresistible. French workers and students continue their powerful demonstrations.

The demonstrators attacked the police station and engaged in two days of intense battles with reactionary military police.

The head of the French revisionists, Roger, delivered a "campaign" speech, shamelessly beautifying the bourgeois parliamentary "elections" and doing everything to sabotage the people's struggle.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 13th, Paris news: French students, despite the brutal suppression by the bourgeois government, defied the reactionary decree banning public demonstrations. On the 12th, they continued to march and demonstrate in Paris and many other major cities, protesting against the French government's brutal suppression of the workers' and students' movements, and pushing forward the struggle they launched more than a month ago against the decaying capitalist system.

In recent days, French students and workers have once again launched a new wave of struggle. On the 10th and 11th, Paris students and workers fought with reactionary military police throughout the night for two consecutive days, dealing a new heavy blow to the French ruling class, which had already been made anxious and disoriented by the people's struggle. It is reported that on the morning of the 12th, Paris, the center of French bourgeois rule, was still a "battlefield," with "burned cars, destroyed traffic signs, charred barricades, and tree trunks" everywhere. The Paris police authorities admitted that in the night from the 11th to the 12th alone, five police stations were attacked and "damaged to varying degrees" by angry crowds, ten police cars were seized by demonstrators, and many police alarm devices, police cars, and fire trucks were smashed. Seventy-two police officers were injured.

Facing the new wave of struggle by the French people, the cowardly French ruling class once again bared its fangs in suppressing the mass movement. After the French police brutally killed one student and one worker on the 10th and 11th, the French government announced a series of reactionary measures to suppress the mass movement on the 12th, including: banning "any demonstrations and marches," otherwise, they would be prosecuted for "inciting public disorder"; forcibly dissolving seven student and worker organizations, threatening to imprison those who restore these organizations; expelling some students participating in the demonstrations from France. According to the Ministry of the Interior on the 11th, more than thirty students had already been expelled from France.

However, these suppression measures by the French ruling class did not frighten the French workers and students but instead further enraged them. On the 12th, students in many major cities across France defied the government's reactionary ban and organized powerful demonstrations.

In Paris, students marched and demonstrated in the university district, which was heavily guarded by police, protesting against the government's reactionary suppression measures. In the southeastern city of Strasbourg, students from Strasbourg University also took to the streets. The police savagely beat the students with clubs and threw tear gas at them, but the students fought back with stones and glass bottles, forcing the police to retreat in disarray.

Two thousand five hundred workers and students marched and demonstrated in the southern port city of Marseille. The demonstrators sang the "Internationale" and carried banners condemning the French ruling class, marching proudly down the streets.

In the central-western city of Poitiers, students fought with the police when they took to the streets. The police threw tear gas at the students, who retaliated with stones. In Montpellier, Toulouse, Caen, and Bordeaux, students also took to the streets despite the authorities sending large numbers of police to suppress them, demonstrating and protesting against the government's reactionary decrees.

In the face of the increasingly tight suppression of the workers' and students' movements by the French ruling class, the head of the French revisionist group, Roger, delivered a campaign speech on the 12th, whitewashing the parliamentary "election" fraud of the ruling class to sabotage the people's struggle. In his speech, he once again shamelessly attacked the revolutionary struggle of students and workers over the past month as "blind provocation and the use of violence"; he also declared that the goal of the French revisionist group was merely to establish a bourgeois "coalition government" in France where they could get a share of the leftovers. This shows that the more the people's struggle develops, the more the traitorous face of the revisionists is exposed.

In the Paris University campus, students hung portraits of the great leaders of the proletariat, Lenin and Chairman Mao, and revolutionary slogans, bravely continuing the struggle.

### 反动法令何足惧　斗争怒潮不可挡  法国工人学生再接再厉举行强大示威

    反动法令何足惧　斗争怒潮不可挡
    法国工人学生再接再厉举行强大示威
    示威群众怒袭警察局，同反动军警展开连续两天大搏斗
    法修头目罗歇发表“竞选”演说，无耻美化资产阶级议会“选举”竭力破坏群众斗争
    据新华社十三日讯　巴黎消息：法国学生不顾资产阶级政府的血腥镇压，蔑视不准群众上街示威的反动法令，十二日继续在巴黎和其他许多大城市游行示威，抗议法国政府镇压工人和学生运动的暴行，把他们一个多月前掀起的反对腐朽的资本主义制度的斗争，继续推向前进。
    这几天，法国学生和工人一起再一次掀起了斗争的新高潮，在十日和十一日，巴黎学生和工人连续两天上街同反动军警进行了通宵达旦的搏斗，使早已被人民斗争弄得坐卧不安、狼狈不堪的法国统治集团遭到了新的沉重打击。据报道，十二日清晨，巴黎这个法国资产阶级的统治中心仍然是一个“战场”，“街上到处是烧坏的汽车，捣毁了的交通牌，烧焦了的路障和树干”。巴黎的警察当局承认，单是十一日到十二日的一夜之间，就有五个警察分局遭到愤怒的群众袭击而被“不同程度破坏”，十辆警车被示威者缴获，警察的不少警报器、警车、消防车被砸毁，七十二个警察受伤。
    面临着法国人民斗争的新高潮，色厉内荏的法国统治集团再次赤裸裸地露出了它镇压群众运动的狰狞面目。继法国警察在十日和十一日残暴地杀害了学生和工人各一人以后，法国政府十二日又悍然宣布了一系列镇压群众运动的反动措施，包括：禁止“举行任何示威游行”，否则，将以“煽动群众闹事”罪“受到司法起诉”；强行解散七个学生和工人组织，威胁要对恢复这些组织的人判处徒刑；把参加示威的一些学生驱逐出法国，据内政部十一日承认，被驱逐出法国的学生已达三十多人。
    但是，法国统治集团这些镇压措施吓不倒法国的工人和学生，而是更加激起了他们的愤怒。十二日，法国全国许多大城市的学生，蔑视政府的反动禁令，再次组织了强大的示威。
    在巴黎，学生在警察密布的大学区举行游行示威，抗议政府采取的反动的镇压措施。在法国东南部的大城斯特拉斯堡，斯特拉斯堡大学的学生也上街游行。警察野蛮地用木棍殴打学生，并且向学生投掷催泪弹，但学生用石块、玻璃瓶等向警察反击，迫使警察狼狈逃走。
    二千五百名工人和学生在法国南部海港马赛游行示威。示威者高唱《国际歌》，打着谴责法国统治集团的横幅标语，在大街上浩浩荡荡地行进。
    在中西部的波厄蒂埃，学生在上街示威时同警察进行了搏斗，警察向学生投掷催泪弹，学生也用石块反击。在蒙彼利埃、图卢兹、卡昂和波尔多等其他大城市，学生也都不顾当局派出大批警察镇压，上街举行游行示威，抗议政府的反动法令。
    在法国统治集团越来越加紧镇压工人和学生运动的情况下，法修集团总头目罗歇十二日再次发表竞选演说，为统治集团破坏群众斗争的议会“选举”骗局涂脂抹粉。他在演说中又一次无耻攻击学生和工人一个多月来的革命斗争是“盲目挑衅和使用暴力”；他还表白，法修集团的目标，只是要在法国建立一个它能分到一杯残羹的资产阶级“联合政府”。这表明，人民的斗争越发展，法修的叛徒面目暴露得越充分。（附图片）
