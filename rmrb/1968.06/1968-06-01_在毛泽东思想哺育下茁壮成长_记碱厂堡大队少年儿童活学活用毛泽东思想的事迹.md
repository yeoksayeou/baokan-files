The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the People's Liberation Army Shenyang Unit stationed in Shanchengzi Commune, Benxi County, Jianchangpu Brigade, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on cultivating and fostering successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution, actively organized and educated the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in the three great revolutionary struggles, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and grow strong in the storms of class struggle.

Initially, the propaganda team told the children of poor and lower-middle peasants stories about the Long March of the Red Army and the Anti-Japanese Children's Corps, and invited old poor peasants to recall the bitterness and sweetness of the past, conducting class education for the children. After several profound and vivid educational sessions, the children's deep class feelings of love for Chairman Mao were aroused. The children studied Chairman Mao's works every day, and their class consciousness grew day by day. Soon, a team of 22 Red Children was formed.

Eagerly Propagating Mao Zedong Thought

With the help of the propaganda team, the Red Children organized more than ten propaganda groups. Whenever it was time to study, they would go to various study groups to teach the poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's quotations and the "Three Articles" word by word. They propagated during the day in the fields and at night by the kang (bed). Whenever Chairman Mao issued new directives, they promptly propagated them to the poor and lower-middle peasants, ensuring that Chairman Mao's new directives were propagated without delay.

There was an old man in his seventies named Sun, who had difficulty participating in the study classes. The Red Children team assigned Li Chunting and Li Mingchun to specially help him study Chairman Mao's works. Old Man Sun said emotionally, "In the old society, I worked for the landlord for decades, not to mention studying, I couldn't even eat. Now, I am illiterate and have difficulty studying. You help me study according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao is closest to us, and we love to listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. I will do my best to be loyal to Chairman Mao forever." Old Man Sun's words had a great impact on the children. They felt that Old Man Sun loved Chairman Mao deeply and decided to learn from him. From then on, the Red Children more patiently helped Old Man Sun study Chairman Mao's works, finally helping him memorize the "Three Articles" and many of Chairman Mao's quotations and new directives.

The Red Children followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. When Chairman Mao issued the directive that "holding study classes is a good method," they took the lead in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes at home, using Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the family front.

Woman Bridget Fuchun, who had previously been misled by the "Three Selfs and One Package" of the Chinese Khrushchev due to her low awareness of the line struggle, not only engaged in small-scale farming herself but also held her husband back from becoming the team leader. Her second son, the leader of the Red Children team, Yu Haiwu, organized the whole family to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class, specifically helping his mother to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, criticize and repudiate private thoughts and revisionism, and severely criticize the "Three Selfs and One Package." Since his mother was illiterate, he first taught her to learn "Zhang," "Bai," and "Yu," and wrote these three characters on the wall, making her think of Zhang Zide's complete and thorough service to the people when she saw "Zhang," think of Bai Qien's selflessness and dedication to others when she saw "Bai," and think of "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" when she saw "Yu." Mao Zedong Thought illuminated Bridget Fuchun's heart, making her recognize the harm of the Chinese Khrushchev's "Three Selfs and One Package" and take the lead in handing over the small-scale farming to the collective. From then on, she thought only of the collective and did everything for the collective, becoming an active learner and applier of Mao Zedong Thought in the county.

In Labor, Struggle Against Private Thoughts and Prevent Revisionism

Most of the Red Children are the children of poor and lower-middle peasants and have the good habit of loving labor. The propaganda team organized them to pick manure for the brigade. Initially, everyone was very enthusiastic. After some time, the weather gradually turned cold, and some said, "If we keep doing this, it's too cold and tiring to bear." The propaganda team paid attention to guiding the children to use Mao Zedong Thought to resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology in the practice of production struggle.

The propaganda team organized the Red Children team to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "What is work? Work is struggle," "It is not difficult for a person to do a good deed, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life," and invited old poor peasant Li Quansheng to tell them the heroic deeds of Li Mingchun's uncle, who sacrificed his life for the people's liberation. The children were greatly educated. From then on, the Red Children team got up early and worked late, undeterred by wind and snow, picking manure for the brigade every day. The children all said, "The more manure we pick, the more public spirit we add, and the more we contribute to defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

Under the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the Red Children team always paid attention to learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants, taking root in labor from a young age. To turn the brigade's land into "Dazhai Fields," the Red Children team helped pick floating stones. Without baskets, they went up the mountain to cut vines and weave baskets themselves, working early and late like adults. Some children's hands were rubbed raw, but they did not complain. They fought against nature and the earth, and also fought against the bourgeois ideology in their minds, consciously breaking private thoughts and establishing public spirit in labor. Red Child Li Chunting was small, and after carrying baskets for a few days, his shoulders were swollen. A child wanted to replace him, but he immediately declined, letting the child go to support others. In the afternoon, his shoulders hurt even more, and he regretted it, thinking: "If I had let that child replace me in the morning, it would have been better." But he immediately thought of Chairman Mao's words: "Many people are irresponsible in their work, picking the light and avoiding the heavy, pushing the heavy burdens onto others, and taking the light ones themselves." He thought, "Chairman Mao's words are criticizing me!" So, he gritted his teeth and persevered day after day until all the stones in the field were picked.

Every time the Red Children team did something, they compared it with Zhang Zide and Bai Qien, constantly using Mao Zedong Thought to open up a new sky of public spirit in their minds. They said, "Do public-spirited things every day, add bricks and tiles to public spirit every day. Over time, a great wall of public spirit against private thoughts and revisionism will be built in labor, and the imperialists and modern revisionists, as well as the Chinese Khrushchev, will not be able to realize their dream of restoring capitalism in our country."

In the Struggle Between the Two Lines

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team believed that to cultivate the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause from the offspring of poor and lower-middle peasants, it is necessary to fundamentally raise the children's awareness of the struggle between the two lines and to deeply plant the roots of loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line from a young age. Therefore, they actively organized the children to go through the storms of the struggle between the two lines. Initially, the Red Children participated in criticism meetings but did not speak, thinking that it was the adults' business and that children could not do it. Aiming at this active thought, the propaganda team used the facts of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in their local area to educate the children to recognize the reactionary nature of the Chinese Khrushchev, greatly arousing their hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and the bourgeois reactionary line he promoted. With the help of the propaganda team, the Red Children also linked the facts of seven households in their brigade going up the mountain to work individually after the "Three Selfs and One Package" black goods were released, carrying out the remembrance of class bitterness, thinking of Chairman Mao's kindness in liberating the poor and lower-middle peasants; remembering the bitterness of the bourgeois reactionary line, thinking of the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao himself. Through these educations, the children gradually recognized the importance of the struggle between the two lines and actively participated in the great criticism, specially holding a meeting to criticize and struggle against the capitalist roaders in their unit.

After the children's class struggle consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines were greatly enhanced, they earnestly participated in the school's struggle-criticism-transformation, deeply criticizing the bourgeois educational line. Many children linked their actual situations, criticizing the educational system of separating politics and practice promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. They said: Chairman Mao taught us that the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the masses' struggles and grow in the tempering of revolutionary storms.

The Red Children also ran schools according to Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. They, together with revolutionary teachers, boldly formulated new teaching plans and wrote local teaching materials. Children in their teens boldly took to the podium. People praised them as the little pioneers of the educational revolution and the red sentinels on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    在毛泽东思想哺育下茁壮成长
    ——记碱厂堡大队少年儿童活学活用毛泽东思想的事迹
    中国人民解放军沈阳部队某部驻本溪县山城子公社碱厂堡大队毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照毛主席培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的教导，积极组织和教育贫下中农子女参加三大革命斗争实践，活学活用毛泽东思想，在阶级斗争的风浪里茁壮成长。
    开始，宣传队给贫下中农的孩子们讲红军长征和抗日儿童团的故事，请老贫农忆苦思甜，对孩子们进行阶级教育。经过多次深刻生动的教育，激发了孩子们对毛主席无限热爱的深厚阶级感情。孩子们天天学习毛主席的宝书，阶级觉悟一天天提高。不久，成立了一支二十二个人的红孩子队。
    热情宣传毛泽东思想
    在宣传队的帮助下，红孩子组织了十几个宣传小组，学习时间一到，就分头到各学习组，一字一句地教贫下中农学习毛主席语录和“老三篇”。他们白天宣传到地头，晚上宣传到炕头。每当毛主席的最新指示一发表，他们就及时地向贫下中农宣传，做到宣传毛主席的最新指示不过夜。
    有个七十多岁的孙爷爷，参加学习班学习有困难，红孩子队就让李春庭和李明春专门去负责，帮他学习毛主席的书。孙老爷爷感动地说：“旧社会我给地主扛了几十年的活，别说学习，连饭都吃不上。现在没文化，学习有困难，你们按照毛主席的教导专门帮助我学习，真是好。毛主席和我们最亲，毛主席的话我们最爱听。我要做到人老心更红，永远忠于毛主席。”老爷爷的这番话对孩子们教育很大，他们觉得孙爷爷无限热爱毛主席，决心向孙爷爷学习。从此，红孩子们更加耐心地帮助孙爷爷学习毛主席著作，终于帮助孙爷爷背下了“老三篇”和许多条毛主席语录和最新指示。
    红孩子紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，毛主席关于“办学习班，是个好办法”的最新指示一发表，他们就在家里带头大办毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想占领家庭阵地。
    家庭妇女吴秀琴，过去因路线斗争觉悟不高，上了中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的当，不仅自己搞小开荒，还拉丈夫的后腿，不叫丈夫当队长。她的二儿子、红孩子队的队长于海武，针对他妈妈的活思想，组织全家办起了毛泽东思想学习班，专门帮助妈妈活学活用毛泽东思想，斗私批修，狠批“三自一包”。妈妈没有文化，他就先教她学“张”、“白”、“愚”，并把这三个字写在墙上，使妈妈看到“张”字，就想起张思德完全彻底为人民服务；看见“白”字，就想起白求恩毫不利己专门利人；看到“愚”字，就想起“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛泽东思想照亮了吴秀琴的心，使她认清了中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的危害，带头把小开荒交给了集体。从此，她一心想着集体，一切为着集体，成为县里活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子。
    在劳动中斗私防修
    红孩子大多数是贫下中农的子女，有热爱劳动的良好习惯。宣传队就把他们组织起来，为队里拣粪。开始大家积极性很高。过了一些日子，天气渐渐冷了起来，有的说：“总这样干，又冷又累受不了。”宣传队就注意引导孩子们在生产斗争的实践中，用毛泽东思想抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀。
    宣传队组织红孩子队学习了毛主席关于“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争”，“一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事”等教导，还请老贫农李全生给他们讲了红孩子李明春的伯父为了人民的解放壮烈牺牲的英雄事迹。孩子们听了受到很大教育。从此以后，红孩子队起早贪黑，风雪无阻，每天给队里拣粪。孩子们都说：“我们多拣一筐粪，就多增加一分公心，就是为捍卫毛主席的革命路线多尽了一分力量。”
    在毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，红孩子队时时处处注意向贫下中农学习，从小扎根在劳动中。为了把队里的土地修成“大寨田”，红孩子队帮助拣浮石，没有筐，就上山割条子自己编筐，和大人一样起早贪黑地干。有的小朋友手磨破了，也不叫一声苦。他们和天斗和地斗，也和自己头脑里的资产阶级思想斗，自觉地在劳动中破私立公。红孩子李春庭个子小，抬了几天筐，肩膀就压肿了，有个小朋友要换他，他马上推辞了，让那个小朋友去支援别人。到了下午，肩膀痛得更厉害了，他有点后悔，心想：如果上午叫那个小朋友换了不就好了吗？可是，他马上想到毛主席的话：“不少的人对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。”他想，“毛主席的话不是批评我吗？”于是，他咬着牙坚持了一天又一天，一直到把地里的石头拣完。
    红孩子队每做一件事，都要和张思德、白求恩比一比，不断用毛泽东思想在自己的头脑中开辟公字的新天地。他们说：“天天做公字的事，天天往公字上增砖添瓦，时间长了，就在劳动中铸成斗私防修的公字长城，帝国主义和现代修正主义以及中国赫鲁晓夫妄想在我国复辟资本主义的美梦就作不成了。”
    在两条路线的斗争中去锻炼
    毛泽东思想宣传队认为，要把贫下中农的后代培养成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，必须从根本上提高孩子们的两条路线斗争觉悟，从小就给孩子们深扎对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“忠”根。因此，他们积极组织孩子们到两条路线斗争的大风大浪中去锻炼。开始，红孩子参加批判会，从不发言，他们认为那是大人们的事，小孩子干不了。针对这个活思想，宣传队用本地两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的事实，教育孩子们认清中国赫鲁晓夫的反动本质，大大激发了他们对中国赫鲁晓夫及其推行的资产阶级反动路线的仇恨。在宣传队的帮助下，红孩子们还联系本队七户社员在“三自一包”的黑货出笼以后，上山去单干等事实，开展了忆阶级苦，想毛主席解放贫下中农的恩情；忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，想毛主席亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义。通过这些教育，孩子们逐步地认识到两条路线斗争的重要性，积极地投入了革命的大批判，专门召开了批判斗争本单位走资派的大会。
    孩子们的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高以后，他们扎扎实实地参加学校的斗批改，深入地批判资产阶级教育路线。许多小朋友联系自己的实际，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的脱离政治、脱离实际的教育制度。他们说：毛主席教导我们，无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。
    红孩子还按照毛主席的无产阶级教育路线办学。他们和革命教师一起大胆地订立新的教学方案，编写了乡土教材。十几岁的娃娃大胆上了讲台。人们称赞他们是教育革命的小闯将，是毛主席革命路线上的红哨兵。
