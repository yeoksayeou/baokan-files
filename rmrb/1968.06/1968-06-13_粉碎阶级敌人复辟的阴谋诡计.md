For a long time, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and the Chinese Khrushchev have colluded, fiercely opposing the great leader Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle." They have been tirelessly peddling the counter-revolutionary revisionist theory of "class struggle extinguished." The Chinese Khrushchev advocates that class struggle has been extinguished, and he follows suit by saying, "We should not emphasize class struggle." The Chinese Khrushchev says, "The revolution is almost complete, the enemy has been defeated," and he follows suit by saying, "The task ahead is to focus on construction." Look, these two fellows, one singing and the other responding, are so in tune, their coordination is so perfect! These two fellows are walking the same path, singing the same tune, and harboring the same evil intentions: they want to lull the communist party members and revolutionary masses into a false sense of security, making them forget class struggle, relax proletarian dictatorship, so that they can, like Khrushchev in the Soviet Union, restore capitalism in China. However, their tricks are doomed to fail. Their counter-revolutionary plots have been thoroughly exposed. Their theory of "class struggle extinguished" has been refuted by countless facts of class struggle.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that class enemies will never accept their own destruction. "They are always studying strategies to counter us, 'scouting the direction,' seeking an opportunity to strike back. Sometimes they will 'play dead,' waiting for the chance to 'counterattack.'" The reality of class struggle fully confirms Chairman Mao's wise judgment.

In our village, there is a landlord who is such a counter-revolutionary dreaming of a reversal of fortune. This fellow, although under the supervision of the broad revolutionary masses for more than a decade of labor reform, his landlord nature has not changed, always preparing for a reversal. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he "played dead," "scouting the direction," waiting for the opportunity. During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when the revolutionary Red Guards rose up to thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, he plotted to muddy the waters, attempting to "counterattack" and achieve his goal. He gave bad advice from behind the scenes, instructing his son to rally some people to struggle against revolutionary cadres. However, his plot was quickly exposed and foiled. Later, we discovered some counter-revolutionary evidence he had hidden for more than twenty years, especially a detailed account book of his plans for a reversal. Who got how much of his land and property, who struggled against him, who educated him, all were recorded in the account book. From the account book, we realized that the cadre he intended to target was the revolutionary cadre who had supervised him most strictly in the past. From this landlord, we saw the remnants of the defeated landlords and the Nationalist reactionaries, gnashing their teeth, glaring with wolfish eyes, holding their account books in one hand and knives in the other, scheming to counterattack. These facts tell us: class struggle has not been "extinguished." The class enemies are still around, their hearts are not dead, they are always preparing to restore the old order, to overthrow proletarian dictatorship, and seize back their lost "paradise." We must never relax our vigilance against these class enemies. If we relax our vigilance and struggle against them, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "Our socialist country will turn to the opposite direction, will change its nature, and will experience a restoration." We must always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings and talk about class struggle "year after year, month after month, day after day."

The great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is the continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses it leads, and the Nationalist reactionaries. It is the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest instructions most perfectly, scientifically, profoundly, and deeply explain the great significance and class content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This latest instruction gives us a clear direction for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This latest instruction is a heavy blow and a powerful criticism of the "class struggle extinguished" theory of the Chinese Khrushchev and the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. This latest instruction is a battle command calling on the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide to fight to the end with the Nationalist reactionaries, imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within the Party—the handful of capitalist-roaders and the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the Party.

We must closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, direct our struggle firmly at the handful of class enemies, deeply and persistently carry out the great criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, and other handful of capitalist-roaders, completely eliminate their revisionist poison in thought and politics, expose all hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, and carry this great political revolution to the end!

    粉碎阶级敌人复辟的阴谋诡计
    四八八六部队通信连战士　马顺海
    长时期来，党内另一个最大的走资派和中国赫鲁晓夫狼狈为奸，疯狂反对伟大领袖毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，竭力兜售反革命修正主义的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭了，他就跟着喊：“不应该强调阶级斗争”了。中国赫鲁晓夫说：“革命是搞得差不多了，敌人已被打倒”了，他就跟着喊：“今后的任务就是搞建设”。看，这两个家伙，一唱一和，多么一致，配合多么协调！他们这两个家伙完全走的是一条路，唱的是一个调，安的也是一个黑心眼：妄想麻痹我们共产党员和革命群众的革命斗志，忘记阶级斗争，放松无产阶级专政，以便他们象苏联赫鲁晓夫那样，在中国复辟资本主义。但是，他们玩弄这一套鬼把戏是注定要失败的。他们的反革命阴谋已经彻底破产了。他们鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，已经被阶级斗争的无数事实批倒了。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，阶级敌人是不会甘心于自己的灭亡的，“他们老是在研究对付我们的策略，‘窥测方向’，以求一逞。有时他们会‘装死躺下’，等待时机，‘反攻过去’。”现实阶级斗争完全证实了毛主席的英明论断。
    我们村里一个地主分子，就是这样一个梦想变天的反革命分子。这个家伙，虽然在广大革命群众的管制下，劳动改造了十几年，但是他的地主阶级本性依然没有改变，时刻都在准备变天。在无产阶级文化大革命前，他“装死躺下”，“窥测方向”，等待时机。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，当革命的红卫兵起来大造以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的反的时候，他竟阴谋把水搅浑，妄图“反攻过去”，以求一逞。他在幕后出坏主意，叫他的儿子拉一些人去斗争革命干部。但是，他的这个阴谋，很快就被我们识破了，粉碎了。后来，我们又查出他藏了二十多年的一些反革命罪证，特别是一本写得很详细的变天账。谁分了他多少土地、财产，谁斗争过他，教训过他，都写在变天账上。从变天账上，我们发觉，他妄想重点斗争的那个干部，正是过去对他管制最严厉的革命干部。从这个地主分子的身上，我们看到了那些被打倒的地主分子、被打倒的国民党反动派的残渣余孽，咬着牙齿，瞪着狼眼，一手拿着变天账，一手拿着刀，妄想反扑过来的一副副凶相。这些事实告诉我们：阶级斗争并没有“熄灭”。阶级敌人人还在，心不死，他们时刻都在准备复辟，准备推翻无产阶级专政，夺回他们失去的“天堂”。对于这些阶级敌人，我们千万不可放松警惕，如果对他们放松了警惕，放松了斗争，就会象毛主席所指出的那样：“我们这样的社会主义国家，就会走向反面，就会变质，就会出现复辟。”我们一定牢记毛主席的伟大教导，对于阶级斗争“必须年年讲，月月讲，天天讲”。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的这一最新指示，最完善、最科学、最精辟、最深刻地阐明了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和阶级内容。这一最新指示，给我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，进一步指明了前进方向。这一最新指示，是对中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大走资派的“阶级斗争熄灭”论的一个最沉重的打击和最有力的批判。这一最新指示，是号召全国无产阶级革命派同国民党反动派、帝国主义、资产阶级和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右在共产党内的代理人——党内一小撮走资派及混进党内的叛徒、特务、反革命分子斗争到底的战斗命令。
    我们一定要紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，学好用好毛主席的最新指示，把斗争矛头紧紧对准一小撮阶级敌人，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫、党内另一个最大的走资派等党内一小撮走资派批深批透，斗倒斗臭，从思想上、政治上彻底肃清他们的修正主义流毒，把隐藏的叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子统统挖出来，把这场伟大的政治大革命进行到底！
