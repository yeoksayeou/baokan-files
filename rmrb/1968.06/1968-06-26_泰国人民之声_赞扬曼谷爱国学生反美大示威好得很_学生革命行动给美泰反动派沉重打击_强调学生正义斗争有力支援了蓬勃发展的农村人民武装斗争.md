"Voice of the Thai People" radio station issued a commentary on June 24, enthusiastically praising and firmly supporting the massive anti-American demonstration organized by Bangkok students on June 21. The students protested against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and the Thanom-Kittikachorn traitorous clique's role as American lackeys.

The commentary said, the students who participated in the demonstration directed their struggle squarely at U.S. imperialist aggressors and their lackeys, the Thanom-Kittikachorn traitorous clique, which is ruining the country. They raised clear and militant slogans, such as opposing U.S. imperialism's use of Thailand as a military base for invading Vietnam and opposing the Thanom-Kittikachorn traitorous clique's unyielding role as American lackeys. The students bravely fought against the reactionary police who came to suppress the demonstration, showing a spirit of fearless rebellion.

The commentary said, this rebellion by Bangkok patriotic students against the Thai-American reactionaries is excellent. All patriotic and democratic people and students enthusiastically praise and firmly support their patriotic struggle, and strongly condemn the American-Thanom clique's heinous crime of brutally suppressing the demonstrating students.

The commentary pointed out, the rebellion by Bangkok students has politically dealt a heavy blow to the American-Thanom reactionary clique, supporting the burgeoning armed struggle of the rural people. The American-Thanom clique's brutal suppression of patriotic students only exposes the fact that the bogus constitution they have promulgated is a thorough political fraud.

The commentary pointed out, this anti-American demonstration by Bangkok students is part of the Thai people's patriotic and democratic struggle. It will have a profound impact on all patriotic people and students who are willing to oppose American aggressors and the Thanom-Kittikachorn traitorous clique, broadening the nationwide patriotic and democratic struggle, powerfully supporting the burgeoning armed struggle of the rural people, forming a mighty revolutionary torrent, and more powerfully assaulting the reactionary rule of the American-Thanom clique.

    学生革命行动给美泰反动派沉重打击

    新华社二十五日讯 “泰国人民之声”电台二十四日发表评论，热烈赞扬并坚决支持曼谷学生在二十一日举行的声势浩大的反对美帝国主义侵略越南和反对他侬—巴博卖国集团充当美帝帮凶的示威游行。
    评论说，示威游行的学生，把斗争矛头直接指向美帝国主义侵略者及其仆从、祸国殃民的他侬—巴博卖国集团。他们提出反对美帝国主义利用泰国为侵越军事基地和反对他侬—巴博卖国集团死心塌地充当美帝帮凶等鲜明的战斗口号。学生们同前往镇压示威游行的反动警察进行了英勇的搏斗，表现了不畏强暴的革命造反精神。
    评论说，这次曼谷爱国学生对美泰反动派的革命造反好得很。所有爱国爱民主的人民和学生热烈赞扬和坚决支持他们的爱国斗争，强烈谴责美国—他侬集团疯狂镇压示威游行学生的滔天罪行。
    评论指出，曼谷学生起来革命造反，在政治上沉重地打击了美国—他侬反动集团，支援了正在蓬勃发展的农村人民武装斗争。美国—他侬集团疯狂镇压爱国学生，只能暴露它们所颁布的伪宪法是彻头彻尾的政治大骗局。
    评论指出，这次在曼谷爆发的学生反美示威是泰国人民爱国民主斗争的一部分。它对于一切愿意反对美国侵略者和他侬—巴博卖国集团的爱国人民和学生，必将产生深远的影响，使全国人民的爱国民主斗争更广泛地开展，有力地配合蓬勃发展的农村人民武装斗争，形成强大的革命洪流，更猛烈地冲击美国—他侬集团的反动统治。
