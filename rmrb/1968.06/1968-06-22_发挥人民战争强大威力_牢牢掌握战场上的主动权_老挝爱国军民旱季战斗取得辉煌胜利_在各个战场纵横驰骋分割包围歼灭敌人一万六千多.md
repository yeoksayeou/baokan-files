The heroic and battle-hardened patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos have, in the seven-month dry season battles of last winter and this spring, unleashed the formidable power of people's war. From the northern region of Phong Saly to the southern region of Attapeu, they have roamed freely, taking the initiative to strike the enemy, achieving a glorious victory of annihilating over 16,000 enemy troops. This has added a new chapter to the history of the Lao people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

Throughout the dry season battles, the patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos have firmly grasped the initiative on the battlefield. On January 12, the Lao People's Liberation Army concentrated superior forces to launch a fierce assault on the strategic stronghold of Nam Bakeo in the northern region. After 12 days of intense fighting, they annihilated over 3,000 enemy troops and recaptured this important position. The victory at Nam Bakeo dealt a heavy blow to the enemy, shattering the plans of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to use Nam Bakeo as a springboard to invade the northern liberation areas. This marked the beginning of the dry season battles. Subsequently, the Lao People's Liberation Army, riding on the momentum of victory, advanced further and won a series of battles along Route 9 and the military stronghold of the Bolaven Plateau in the southern region. They captured the strategic position of Vieng Xay on the Lao-Vietnam border, controlling Route 9. They then liberated a large area from Pakxan to Ban Kong and encircled and isolated most of the enemy forces stationed on the Bolaven Plateau in cities like Saravane and Attapeu, basically controlling the entire plateau.

On the Xieng Khouang battlefield, the patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos also successively recaptured Mang Sais, Taton, and Tavane, expanding the liberated area of the Xieng Khouang Plain and completely foiling the enemy's plans to invade the plain. They also directly threatened the enemy's strongholds of Nong Het and Tchepone on Route 13.

As the Lao People's Liberation Army grew stronger, their combat effectiveness also improved significantly. They particularly focused on annihilation battles, decimating large numbers of enemy troops. Nowadays, it is common for the patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos to annihilate entire enemy battalions. According to reports, during the dry season, they annihilated seven enemy battalions and severely damaged 32 others. In the battle of Nam Bakeo alone, they annihilated two enemy mobile brigades and severely damaged several battalions.

During this dry season, while continuously launching attacks on the enemy, the patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos also vigorously developed guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear, effectively supporting the frontline battles. During the intense fighting to capture Nam Bakeo, the local forces and guerrillas of Luang Prabang Province swiftly attacked the Luang Prabang Airport, destroying 14 enemy aircraft and paralyzing their air transport. During the battle for the Bolaven Plateau, the local guerrillas of Saravane Province attacked the command post of the enemy's 802nd Mobile Brigade and the command posts of its 2nd and 5th Airborne Battalions, disrupting the enemy's command system and annihilating over 250 enemy troops. On February 7, the local guerrillas blew up the enemy's important bridge over the Xe Bangfai River, cutting off Route 13 and causing serious transportation difficulties for the enemy. The development of guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear by the patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos turned the enemy's rear into a battlefield for annihilating the enemy, further putting the enemy in a more passive and vulnerable position.

Since the dry season, the patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos have further intensified their anti-bandit activities in the liberated areas, achieving significant victories and greatly consolidating the liberated zones. In mid-March, the patriotic military and civilian forces of Sam Neua Province completely destroyed the bandit stronghold of Baty, annihilating over 500 bandits. The patriotic military and civilian forces of Phong Saly Province eliminated the bandit nests in Oudom and Oun. The patriotic military and civilian forces of Luang Namtha Province recaptured Mang Noy and Namtha City. The patriotic military and civilian forces of Xieng Khouang, Sam Neua, and Udomsai Provinces also annihilated large numbers of bandits and eliminated many bandit strongholds.

Under the heavy blows from the patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos, U.S. imperialism and its Lao lackeys are in a state of panic. U.S. imperialism has repeatedly lamented that the situation in Laos is "disturbing." The contradictions within the Lao right-wing have become even more acute. The morale of the right-wing soldiers and the American-sponsored bandits is extremely low, with many surrendering to the people. According to statistics, in the first five months of the dry season alone, the number of enemy troops surrendering or deserting was almost eight times that of the previous dry season. U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are facing imminent doom on the battlefield in Laos.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. As we often say, all reactionaries are merely paper tigers. In essence, they are reactionaries and we are revolutionaries. We are the future, the miners of history; they are the past, the oncoming victims of history. They are paper tigers. We must not be afraid of them." Currently, U.S. imperialism, in an attempt to stabilize its position in Laos, is colluding with Soviet modern revisionism to stage the so-called "three-party talks" charade, desperately seeking a respite to further escalate the war in Laos. However, no matter how U.S. imperialism and its Lao lackeys struggle, they cannot avert their inevitable defeat. The heroic people of Laos will surely achieve a complete victory in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

    发挥人民战争强大威力　牢牢掌握战场上的主动权
    老挝爱国军民旱季战斗取得辉煌胜利
    在各个战场纵横驰骋分割包围歼灭敌人一万六千多
    新华社讯　本社记者报道：英勇善战的老挝爱国军民在去冬今春旱季七个月的战斗中，发挥人民战争的强大威力，从上寮丰沙里到下寮占巴色，纵横驰骋，主动打击敌人，取得了歼敌一万六千多名的辉煌胜利，为老挝人民抗美救国斗争史增添了新的篇章。
    在整个旱季战斗中，老挝爱国军民始终牢牢掌握着战场上的主动权。今年一月十二日，老挝人民解放军集中优势兵力，对上寮战略要地南博，发起猛烈进攻，经过十二天的激战，歼敌三千多名，收复了这个重要据点。南博大捷，给了敌人沉重打击，粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗把南博作为进攻上寮解放区的跳板的阴谋，从而揭开了旱季战斗的序幕。接着，老挝人民解放军乘胜挺进，在九号公路和下寮军事要地波罗芬高原打了一系列胜仗，一举攻克位于老越边境的战略要地会山，控制了九号公路。随后又解放了发卡那到班冈的大片土地，并将驻扎在波罗芬高原的大部分守敌分割包围在沙拉湾、阿速坡等城镇，基本上控制了这个高原。
    在川圹战场上，老挝爱国军民也先后收复了芒岸、塔通、塔文等地，扩大了查尔平原解放区，使敌人进攻查尔平原的阴谋完全破产，并使敌人在十三号公路上的重镇北汕和他曲直接受到威胁。
    老挝人民解放军在发展壮大的同时，作战水平也有了很大提高。尤其是他们注意打歼灭战，吃掉敌人大批有生力量。现在，老挝爱国军民全歼整营敌军的战例屡见不鲜。据公布，在旱季里，老挝爱国军民全歼敌人七个营，重创三十二个营，仅南博一役，就全歼敌人两个机动团，重创数个营。
    在这个旱季中，老挝爱国军民在对敌人不断发动进攻的同时，还大力开展了敌后人民游击战争，有力地配合了正面作战。在老挝人民解放军进攻南博的激战中，琅勃拉邦省地方部队和游击队以迅雷不及掩耳之势，袭击了琅勃拉邦机场，击毁敌机十四架，使敌人空运陷于瘫痪。在进攻波罗芬高原的战役中，沙拉湾省地方游击队袭击了寮岸守敌八○二机动团指挥部及其第二、第五两个空降营营部，打乱了敌人的指挥系统，歼敌二百五十多名。二月七日，地方游击队炸毁了舍邦费河上的敌人的重要桥梁，拦腰切断了十三号公路，使敌人南北运输发生严重困难。老挝爱国军民敌后游击战争的开展，把敌人的后方也变成了消灭敌人的战场，使敌人陷于更加被动挨打的困境。
    旱季以来，老挝爱国军民在解放区进一步开展剿匪活动，取得了很大胜利，从而大大巩固了解放区。桑怒省爱国军民三月中旬彻底摧毁了巴提土匪老巢，一举歼匪五百多名。丰沙里省爱国军民拔除了盘踞在乌代、乌怒等地的土匪巢穴。琅南塔省的爱国军民收复了芒囊及南塔市。川圹、甘蒙、乌多姆塞等省爱国军民也消灭了大批土匪，拔除了许多土匪据点。
    在老挝爱国军民的沉重打击下，美帝国主义及其老挝走狗惊慌万状，惶惶不可终日。美帝国主义一再哀叹，老挝的局势是“令人不安的”。老挝右派内部的矛盾更加尖锐。右派士兵及美国豢养的土匪的士气十分低落，纷纷向人民投降。据统计，仅旱季头五个月，敌军投降和开小差的人数几乎相当于上一个旱季的八倍。美帝国主义及其走狗在老挝战场上正面临着灭顶之灾。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。他们必然要采取军事冒险和政治欺骗的种种手段，来挽救自己的灭亡。”当前，美帝国主义为稳住在老挝的阵脚，正伙同苏联现代修正主义玩弄所谓“三方会谈”的骗局，妄图争取喘息时间，进一步扩大老挝战争。但是，不管美帝国主义及其老挝走狗如何挣扎，都无法挽救它们彻底失败的命运。英雄的老挝人民必将取得抗美救国斗争的彻底胜利。（附图片）
