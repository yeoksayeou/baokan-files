As the U.S. imperialists suffer heavy defeats in their aggression against Vietnam, the power struggle between the puppet cliques of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky has intensified. The puppet "president" Nguyen Van Thieu, in an effort to eliminate rivals and maintain his shaky reactionary rule, has recently dismissed a batch of close aides of the puppet "vice president" Nguyen Cao Ky from key military and political positions.

Not long ago, after Nguyen Van Thieu ousted Nguyen Cao Ky's supporter Nguyen Van Loc from the post of puppet "prime minister," he immediately appointed his own confidant Tran Van Huong to form a new puppet cabinet, thereby pushing out several people closely associated with Nguyen Cao Ky. Subsequently, Nguyen Van Thieu, in collusion with Tran Van Huong, successively removed Nguyen Cao Ky's supporters from their posts, including the puppet "commander of the Saigon Military Region" Le Nguyen Khang, the puppet "mayor of Saigon" Vu Van Dang, and the puppet "director of the National Police" Nguyen Van Loan, and immediately installed his own cronies, severely weakening Nguyen Cao Ky's influence. According to Western news agencies, Nguyen Van Thieu also plans to remove another of Nguyen Cao Ky's close aides, Cao Van Vien, from his post as the puppet "chairman of the Joint General Staff," in order to further strike at Nguyen Cao Ky.

Nguyen Cao Ky is certainly not one to back down easily and is plotting countermeasures against Nguyen Van Thieu. According to reports from Western news agencies, there is a strong rumor in Saigon that Nguyen Cao Ky is about to have a final showdown with Nguyen Van Thieu. This dog-eat-dog struggle is continuing.

The intensifying infighting between these two puppets of the U.S. in South Vietnam reflects the serious military and political crises facing the U.S.-puppet regime under the heavy blows of the Vietnamese people. Although the American masters have repeatedly attempted to ease the tensions between the puppets, the infighting within the Saigon puppet regime has only grown more intense. The shaky U.S.-puppet regime, despite its struggles, cannot escape its doomed fate.

    西贡傀儡集团狗咬狗丑剧愈演愈烈
    阮文绍竭力排除异己接连撤换一批阮高其的亲信
    新华社十一日讯　西贡消息：随着美帝国主义在侵越战争中惨遭失败，阮文绍—阮高其傀儡集团之间勾心斗角、争权夺利的斗争越来越尖锐化，伪“总统”阮文绍为了排除异己和维持自己摇摇欲坠的反动统治，最近接连撤换了一批担任伪军政要职的伪“副总统”阮高其的亲信。
    不久前，阮文绍将阮高其的支持者阮文禄从伪“总理”的宝座上撵下来以后，马上要他自己的亲信陈文香拼凑了新的傀儡内阁班子，从而排挤了好几个同阮高其关系密切的人员。接着，阮文绍又伙同陈文香先后撤换了支持阮高其的伪“西贡军区司令”黎沅康、伪“西贡市长”万文距和伪“国家警察总监”阮玉銮的职务并立即安插上了自己的亲信，严重削弱了阮高其的势力。据西方通讯社透露，阮文绍还打算解除阮高其的另一名亲信高文园的伪“参谋长联席会议主席”的职务，以便进一步打击阮高其。
    阮高其当然也不甘示弱，正在策划采取措施对付阮文绍。据西方通讯社报道，最近西贡盛传阮高其即将同阮文绍“最后决裂”。这场狗咬狗的斗争正在继续进行中。
    美国在南越豢养的这两条走狗之间日益加剧的争斗，反映了美伪集团在越南南方军民的沉重打击下，面临着军事、政治的严重危机。虽然美国主子一再设法企图缓和走狗的矛盾，可是南越傀儡集团之间狗咬狗的丑剧越演越烈。风雨飘摇中的美伪政权，不管如何挣扎，都无法挽救他们彻底灭亡命运。
