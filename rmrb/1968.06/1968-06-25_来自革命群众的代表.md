Representatives from the Revolutionary Masses

The deputy director of the Guangdong Revolutionary Committee and an active member of the Guangzhou Military Region in studying Chairman Mao's works, Huang Yuying, is a revolutionary youth who has emerged from the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line. This daughter of a poor peasant, who was over twenty years old, had already posted big-character posters in July 1966, launching a fierce attack on the black "Cultivation of the Self" by China's Khrushchev. During the two-year Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, she has grown under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. The following are a few short stories about her work and life after she became the deputy director of the provincial revolutionary committee. Do not allow the class enemies to reverse the verdicts!

After Huang Yuying joined the work of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, she received many letters from the masses. Most of these letters were from revolutionary comrades of the proletariat and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, expressing their enthusiastic encouragement. However, some letters were filled with bourgeois vulgar flattery; some bad elements even disguised themselves as "victims" under the cover of "revolutionary" language, asking Huang Yuying for "support" and "rehabilitation," openly demanding to reverse the verdicts of past political movements. Huang Yuying firmly remembers Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and maintains a high degree of class vigilance. From these letters, she sensed the "gunpowder smell" of class struggle. She acutely realized that the rightist reversal wind had also blown into the countryside. She forwarded letters related to this issue to the relevant revolutionary committees and departments for reference and handling; she resolutely countered the blatant reversal activities of a handful of class enemies.

One day, two unwelcome guests came to Huang Yuying's home. One was a rich peasant who was exposed during the Four Clean-ups, and the other was a degenerate element. As soon as they appeared, Huang Yuying understood a bit. As soon as these two entered the door, they bowed and scraped, flattering her. Seeing that Huang Yuying did not speak, the rich peasant said, "Yuying! I heard that you were persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line two years ago, and I was very sad! Now it's good, the party has rehabilitated you and given you power, and we are really happy! Now, we who were persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line should have someone to support us!" Hearing this, Huang Yuying could no longer endure it. She sternly rebuked these two, saying, "The handful of capitalist roaders within the party, with China's Khrushchev at the helm, stubbornly pushed the bourgeois reactionary line, 'encircled' the revolutionary factions, and labeled revolutionary masses as 'counter-revolutionaries.' This injustice must be rectified. However, a handful of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists dare to try to reverse the verdicts and carry out capitalist restoration, which will never succeed. You can only submit to the masses' supervision and reform yourself, which is the only way out." Huang Yuying's words were like a series of cannon shots, making these two very embarrassed, and they quickly slinked away.

Is a good cadre? Then support them!

In the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, a leader in Guilin Commune executed the bourgeois reactionary line and labeled Huang Yuying as a "counter-revolutionary." After Huang Yuying was rehabilitated, she repeatedly posted big-character posters, believing that this cadre was a capitalist-roader within the party in the commune and must be resolutely overthrown. When this cadre made a relatively deep self-criticism during the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, the masses were relatively satisfied. When the commune was considering the establishment of the revolutionary committee, some revolutionary masses thought he could participate in the "three-in-one combination."

How does Huang Yuying view this cadre who had once persecuted her? Should she insist on her past views? Or should she act according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy, historically and comprehensively evaluate and examine this cadre? Huang Yuying firmly remembers Chairman Mao's teaching, "We must also be good at uniting those who have opposed us and have been proven by practice to have made mistakes." From the principle of party spirit, she resolutely implements Chairman Mao's cadre policy and correctly handles this cadre. She learned about this cadre's entire history from the county revolutionary preparatory committee; she fully listened to the opinions of the broad revolutionary masses and then drew a new conclusion: this cadre's fundamental principles are good, although he made some mistakes, just as Chairman Mao taught, "Making mistakes is inevitable, as long as they are corrected seriously, it's fine." Thus, Huang Yuying visited this cadre several times to talk heart-to-heart, helping him recognize and correct his mistakes. When she went to the prefecture for a meeting, she also wrote letters and sent telegrams back, expressing her support for this cadre to participate in the commune's "three-in-one combination" leadership cadre, encouraging him to firmly walk the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and dare to come out to work. Under the enthusiastic help of Huang Yuying and the broad revolutionary masses, this cadre finally stood up and took on the position of the commune revolutionary committee director.

Not a moment away from the masses

Huang Yuying participated in a meeting held by the province, staying in a guesthouse. During her rest time, she wanted to go out to buy some things. A comrade, fearing she wouldn't recognize the way, told her to take a small car out. She mistakenly thought this comrade had official business outside and conveniently took the small car to go out. It was not until she returned with the things she bought that she realized it was not a ride but a car specially dispatched for her. Back at the guesthouse, a service staff half-jokingly said, "The leader has returned from going out in a small car!" Hearing this, Huang Yuying's face turned red. She immediately realized: this was the masses' criticism of her.

That evening, Huang Yuying invited the service staff and studied Chairman Mao's quotations with them: "Because we are servants of the people, so if we have shortcomings, we should not fear others pointing them out." Then, she seriously self-criticized her act of taking a small car for personal matters. She sincerely expressed: life's special treatment is the beginning of detachment from the masses, and if it develops, it will turn into being high above the masses, acting like an official and lord, even comfortably turning into revisionism. In the future, she will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Do not be away from the masses for a moment," and always be a servant of the people.

Huang Yuying's spirit of daring to self-criticize and strictly demanding of herself deeply moved the service staff present.

Huang Yuying returned to the village and insisted on participating in collective production labor with the poor and lower-middle peasants, jointly conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation, always maintaining close contact with the masses. Everyone said, "Yuying is a good seedling of ours, the poor and lower-middle peasants. We trust such revolutionary successors."

    来自革命群众的代表
    广东省革委会副主任、广州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子黄育英，是从资产阶级反动路线迫害下冲杀出来的革命小将。这个二十多岁的贫农的女儿，早在一九六六年七月就贴出大字报，向中国赫鲁晓夫的黑《修养》猛烈开火。在两年来的无产阶级文化大革命中，她在毛泽东思想的哺育下不断成长。这里发表的几个小故事，是她担任省革委会副主任以后，工作、生活中的几个片断。决不许阶级敌人翻案
    黄育英同志参加广东省革命委员会的工作以后，收到了许多封群众来信。这些来信，大多数是无产阶级革命派战友和解放军战士们对她热情洋溢的鼓励。但是，也有些来信，字里行间充满了资产阶级庸俗的捧场；有些坏人竟在“革命”词句的掩盖下，装出一副“受害者”的样子，要求黄育英“支持”他们，给他们“平反”，公然提出要翻历次政治运动的案。黄育英牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，保持了高度的阶级警惕性。从这些来信里，她嗅到了阶级斗争的“火药味”。她敏锐地觉察到，右倾翻案风同样也刮到农村来了。有关这方面的来信，她都转给各级革命委员会和有关部门参考处理；对于一小撮阶级敌人明目张胆的翻案活动，她坚决予以反击。
    有一天，黄育英家里来了两个不速之客。一个是四清时被清查出来的富农分子，另一个是蜕化变质分子。他们一露面，黄育英心里就明白了几分。这两个家伙一进门，就点头哈腰地恭维了一番。见黄育英不吭声，那个富农分子就转弯抹角地说：“育英啊！听说你前年受资产阶级反动路线的迫害，我心里难过极了！现在好啦，党给你平了反，掌了大权啦，我们心里着实高兴！咳，这回我们这些受资产阶级反动路线迫害的人该有人支持啦！”听到这里，黄育英再也忍耐不住了，她严肃地斥责这两个家伙说：“中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派顽固推行资产阶级反动路线，‘围剿’革命派，把革命群众打成‘反革命’，这个反一定要平。可是，一小撮地、富、反、坏、右分子妄想借机翻案，搞资本主义复辟，那永远也办不到。你们只有服从群众管制，好好改造，才是唯一的出路。”黄育英的话象一连串的炮弹，使这两个家伙十分狼狈，赶紧灰溜溜地跑了。是好干部就要支持
    桂岭公社有个领导干部，在文化大革命运动初期，执行过资产阶级反动路线，把黄育英同志打成“反革命”。黄育英平反以后，曾经多次贴出大字报，认为这个干部是公社的党内走资派，要坚决打倒。批判资产阶级反动路线时，这个干部对自己的错误检查得比较深刻，群众也比较满意。当公社酝酿成立革委会的时候，有的革命群众认为他还可以参加“三结合”。
    黄育英对这个曾经打击过自己的干部如何看待呢？是坚持过去的看法呢？还是按照毛主席的干部政策办事，历史地全面地衡量和考察这个干部呢？黄育英牢记毛主席“还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人”的教导，从党性原则出发，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，正确对待这个干部。她从县革筹小组里了解了这个干部的全部历史；全面听取了广大革命群众的意见，然后得出了一个新的结论：这个干部的大节基本上是好的，虽然犯了一些错误，正如毛主席教导的：“犯错误是难免的，只要认真改了，就好了。”于是，黄育英几次去找这个干部谈心，帮助他认识错误，改正错误。她到专区去开会时，还写信和打电报回来，表示支持这个干部参加公社“三结合”的领导班子，鼓励他要坚决走群众路线，凡事多和群众商量，大胆站出来工作。在黄育英和广大革命群众的热情帮助下，这个干部终于站了出来，担任了公社革委会主任。一时一刻不脱离群众
    黄育英参加省里召开的会议，住在招待所里。休息时间，她要上街买点东西，一位同志怕她不认得路，叫她坐小汽车出去。她误认为这个同志有公事外出，就顺便搭着小汽车上街去了。直到她买了东西回来，才知道不是搭车而是专为她派的车。回到招待所，一位服务员半开玩笑地说：“首长乘小汽车上街回来啦！”听了这句话，黄育英的脸刷地红了起来。她马上意识到：这是群众对自己的批评。
    当天晚上，黄育英请来了服务员同志，和他们一起学习了毛主席语录：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”接着，她对自己为私事乘小汽车上街的事作了认真的自我批评。她诚恳地表示：生活上的特殊化，就是脱离群众的开始，发展下去，就会变成高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，甚至舒舒服服地向修正主义演变过去。今后自己一定牢记毛主席的教导：“不要有一时一刻脱离群众”，永远做一个人民的勤务员。
    黄育英同志这种勇于自我批评，严格要求自己的革命精神，使在座的服务员同志很受感动。
    黄育英同志回到村里，始终坚持和贫下中农一起参加集体生产劳动，共同办毛泽东思想学习班，一起斗私批修，开展革命大批判，时时刻刻保持和群众的密切联系。大伙说：“育英是我们贫下中农的好苗子，这样的革命接班人我们信得过。”
