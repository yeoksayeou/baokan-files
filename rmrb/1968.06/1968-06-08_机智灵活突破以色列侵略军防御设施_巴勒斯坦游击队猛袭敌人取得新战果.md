On the eve of the first anniversary of the Arab people's struggle against U.S.-Israeli aggression, Palestinian guerrillas have broken through the Israeli aggressors' defensive facilities and launched new attacks, achieving new victories.

The Israeli aggressors, who have been made uneasy by the Palestinian guerrillas, have recently taken various defensive measures in an attempt to prevent the guerrillas from launching more intense attacks. It is reported that the Israeli aggressors have set up electronic surveillance equipment along the West Bank of the Jordan River, and in many places, they have installed military checkpoints, laid barbed wire, and planted landmines. However, the clever and agile Palestinian guerrillas have broken through these facilities and continued to launch a series of attacks within the Israeli-controlled and occupied areas, achieving new victories.

According to a battle report issued by "Fatah" on the evening of the 6th and reports by the Syrian Arab News Agency: On the evening of June 1st, the "Storm" assault team attacked the road near Nirim northwest of the Gaza Strip, the military position at Maliqiya, and the Israeli observation post in the Abu Esa area, killing many aggressor soldiers. The guerrillas also ambushed an enemy convoy in the Ma'man Sam region of the Hula Valley, killing 27 Israeli aggressors, destroying two trucks and one half-tracked military vehicle.

On the evening of the 2nd, the "Storm" assault team laid mines on the road near Wadi Jib to the south of the Dead Sea, destroying an Israeli half-tracked military vehicle and a tank that came to reinforce it. All the aggressors on the vehicles were either killed or wounded. The guerrillas also blew up three Israeli military trucks on the roads from Jenin to Nablus and from Kafr Lapp to Zara.

On the evening of the 3rd, the guerrillas shelled Israeli troops gathered between Kafr Lapp and Muzhaim, destroying one enemy tank and causing heavy casualties among the enemy.

On the evening of the 4th, the "Storm" assault team used mortars to shell the Gush Emunim position in the Israeli-controlled area, destroying several military facilities, and causing fires in other facilities.

According to battle reports from "Fatah" and Syrian newspapers: In the last four days of May, Palestinian guerrillas launched more than ten attacks on the enemy in the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Israeli-controlled areas, killing and wounding more than 120 Israeli aggressors, destroying one tank, two half-tracked military vehicles, and seven other military vehicles. On the evening of the 27th, the "Storm" assault team destroyed an Israeli half-tracked military vehicle on the road from the West Bank of the Jordan River to Bethlehem, killing all the aggressors on the vehicle. The enemy sent two more vehicles for reinforcement, but both were destroyed, and the aggressors on them were also casualties. On the evening of the 30th, the guerrillas stormed into the Israeli military position at Kafr Lapp in the Besan Valley, and after a fierce battle, destroyed the defensive stronghold there, killing 70 Israeli aggressor soldiers.

    新华社大马士革六日电　在阿拉伯人民抗击美以侵略战争一周年的前夕，巴勒斯坦游击队突破以色列侵略军的防御设施，发动新进攻，取得新战果。
    被巴勒斯坦游击队打得坐卧不安的以色列侵略者，最近采取了各种防御措施，妄图阻止巴勒斯坦游击队发动更猛烈的袭击。据报道，以色列侵略者在沿约旦河西岸装置了有电子侦察设备的防御线，还在不少地方装置了电子侦察设备，设立了军事检查站，架上铁丝网，埋设地雷，但是机智灵活的巴勒斯坦游击队突破了这些设施，在以色列统治区和占领区内继续发动了一系列袭击，取得新战果。
    据“法塔赫”六日晚在这里发表的战报和阿拉伯叙利亚通讯社报道：六月一日晚上“暴风”突击队向加沙地带附近的尼里姆西北的公路、马利基亚军事阵地和阿布埃萨地区的以色列观察哨发动了进攻，打死了不少侵略军。游击队还在胡拉河谷的迈曼萨姆地区伏击敌军车队，打死以色列侵略军二十七人，击毁卡车两辆、半履带式军车一辆。
    二日晚上，“暴风”突击队在通往死海以南的瓦迪杰卜附近公路上埋设地雷，炸毁以色列一辆半履带式军车和一辆增援的坦克，车上的侵略军全被炸死或炸伤。游击队还在杰宁到纳布卢斯和克法鲁平到扎拉的公路上炸毁以色列军用卡车三辆。
    三日晚上，游击队炮击了克法鲁平和穆兹哈伊姆之间集结的以色列军队，击毁敌军坦克一辆，并使敌军遭到重大伤亡。
    四日晚上，“暴风”突击队用迫击炮轰击以色列统治区的格歇尔阵地，击毁若干军事设施，另外一些军事设施中弹起火。
    另据“法塔赫”的战报和叙利亚的报纸报道：巴勒斯坦游击队在五月份的最后四天中，向在约旦河西岸和以色列统治区内的敌人发动了十多次袭击，打死打伤以色列侵略军一百二十多名，击毁坦克一辆、半履带式军车两辆和其他军车七辆。二十七日晚上，“暴风”突击队在约旦河西岸通向伯利恒的公路上击毁了以色列的一辆半履带式军车，车上的侵略军全被打死。敌人又开来两车援军，结果两辆军车也被击毁，车上的侵略军都遭伤亡。三十日晚上，游击队冲进了贝桑河谷克法鲁平的以色列军事阵地，经过激烈战斗后，摧毁了那里的防守据点，打死以色列侵略军官兵七十名。
