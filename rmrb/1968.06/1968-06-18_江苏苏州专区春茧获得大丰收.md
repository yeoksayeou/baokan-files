Suzhou Region in Jiangsu Province, a renowned cocoon-producing area in China, has achieved a bumper spring cocoon harvest. The total spring cocoon production in the region this year has increased by 15 percent compared to last year, making it the highest yield in recent years.

The bumper spring cocoon harvest in Suzhou Region is the result of the swift implementation of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production" and his latest instructions. Since the beginning of this year, the revolutionary committees at various levels in Suzhou Region have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously grasped the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, and emphasized proletarian politics. By focusing on the ideological transformation of people, they have promoted the production of silkworms and cocoons.

    江苏苏州专区春茧获得大丰收
    我国著名产茧区江苏省苏州专区春茧获得大丰收。全区今年春茧总产量比去年增产百分之十五，是近年来产量最高的一年。
    苏州专区春茧大丰收，是毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针和一系列最新指示迅速落实的结果。今年以来，苏州专区各级革命委员会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，大力突出无产阶级政治，从搞好人的思想革命化入手，促进了蚕茧生产。
