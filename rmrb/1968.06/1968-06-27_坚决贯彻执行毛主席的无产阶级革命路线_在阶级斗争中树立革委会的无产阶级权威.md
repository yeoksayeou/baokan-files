The revolutionary committee of Tianjin Flax Textile Factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront, consciously placing themselves under the supervision of the masses. Their prestige has been steadily increasing. Workers say, "The revolutionary committee is good, good because it is close to the hearts of the people."

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 26 - After its birth in the stormy class struggle, the revolutionary committee of Tianjin Flax Textile Factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has been strengthened and consolidated in the fierce class struggle. Over the past year, the authority of the revolutionary committee has been continuously enhanced. Revolutionary workers happily say, "We are confident in the revolutionary committee's leadership." Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the entire factory is united, and revolution and production are thriving. After completing the state plan for 17 consecutive months, the factory has once again completed the state plan for the first half of this year ahead of schedule by seven days, with production exceeding the highest level in the factory's history.

Only by persisting in implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can proletarian authority be established.

The development of the revolutionary committee of Tianjin Flax Textile Factory proves that the newly born revolutionary committee can only truly establish proletarian authority by persisting in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. At the beginning of the establishment of the revolutionary committee, some people thought: the members of the revolutionary committee are nominated by the revolutionary masses of the entire factory, the revolutionary committee is supported by the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory, and its establishment is approved by the higher-level revolutionary committee, so it naturally has proletarian authority. However, the members of the revolutionary committee do not think so. They believe that the birth of the revolutionary committee is a victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the newly born revolutionary committee can only establish proletarian authority by resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and using Mao Zedong Thought to exercise power properly.

After its establishment, the revolutionary committee has always placed the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work. The members of the revolutionary committee lead by example in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to guide the current revolutionary criticism and the struggle against the enemy. The entire factory has a daily one-hour study session of Chairman Mao's works, with the members of the revolutionary committee leading by example and never missing a session. Whenever new instructions from Chairman Mao are issued, the revolutionary committee studies them repeatedly overnight and implements them immediately. Various departments and shifts throughout the factory hold study and application sessions of Mao Zedong Thought, with the members of the revolutionary committee leading by example in sharing their experiences with the masses and allowing the masses to evaluate them.

In launching a fierce attack against a handful of class enemies, the revolutionary committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, first established a Mao Zedong Thought study class titled "Never Forget Class Struggle." Using Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle and the theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat as guidelines, they analyzed the new situation, characteristics, trends, and problems of class struggle in the factory. They mobilized the revolutionary masses to expose a small number of deeply hidden traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries, giving the revolutionary workers of the entire factory an extremely profound class education. Through the struggle, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory saw even more clearly that the revolutionary committee truly acts according to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and therefore they trust and support the revolutionary committee even more.

In implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and in carrying out various central tasks, the members of the revolutionary committee are always at the forefront. Where the situation is most difficult and complex, they appear there. At critical moments in defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they always stand up. Last year, there was a period when anarchist thoughts spread, and class enemies attempted to undermine production to shake the newly born revolutionary committee. The members of the revolutionary committee fought alongside the masses, resolutely withstood this reverse current, exposed and smashed the evil plots of the class enemies, and finally completed the state plan on time.

Place themselves under the supervision of the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members must never detach themselves from the masses, must never stand above the masses, act like officials and lords, but should appear before the masses as ordinary laborers, immerse themselves among the masses, and blend in with the masses." The members of the revolutionary committee realize that after taking power, their status has changed, but the essence of being an ordinary laborer must not change. They must consciously place themselves under the supervision of the masses.

Soon after the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee, some cadres were busy with affairs and showed signs of detaching themselves from the masses and labor. Some workers wrote big-character posters criticizing them sharply. This big-character poster attracted the attention of the members of the revolutionary committee. They believed that the spirit of the big-character poster was completely correct, and they immediately wrote a big-character poster welcoming the masses' criticism and made a self-criticism. From then on, the revolutionary committee not only established a system for cadres to participate in collective labor but also made the most labor-intensive and tiring tasks of processing raw flax and splitting flax their "labor base."

The members of the revolutionary committee regard the masses' supervision as the greatest support for themselves. They often conduct rectification campaigns, listen to the masses' opinions, and actively check their own shortcomings and mistakes. Every time the revolutionary committee meets, they read Chairman Mao's instructions on the five criteria for a proletarian revolutionary successor, using Chairman Mao's teachings to demand of themselves, check themselves, and urge themselves forward. Once, a worker found that someone had carelessly thrown away some medicines in the workshop, and he went to the deputy director of the revolutionary committee, Zhou Guoliang, to express his opinion, demanding that the revolutionary committee manage the home well. Zhou Guoliang praised the old worker who raised the issue at a meeting and mobilized the masses to collect the wasted medicines from various places, holding an on-site exhibition to educate the entire factory's workers, which received a good response from the masses. At the beginning of this year, the entire factory's medical expenses exceeded the budget every month, but due to the fight against waste, a new situation of a surplus of 690-plus yuan in medical expenses appeared in May.

To sit on the same bench with the masses in thought.

The revolutionary committee of this factory deeply feels that the members of the revolutionary committee must do both "be an official" and "be a common person." Not only must they labor with the workers, have no airs, and not be special in their lives, but more importantly, they must blend in with the workers in their thoughts and feelings. When formulating the annual production plan for this year, the factory revolutionary committee considered that this year's equipment would undergo major repairs, and the plan could be higher than 1966, but it would be difficult to exceed the highest level of 1967. However, when it was discussed among the workers, the workers criticized the plan for not reflecting Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and the plan was revised. The revolutionary committee originally planned to produce 30,000 more burlap bags in the second quarter, but the workers produced 40,000 more in the first month. This incident deeply educated the members of the revolutionary committee, making them further realize that the members of the revolutionary committee can only achieve the goal of never detaching themselves from the masses by thinking with the masses and sitting on the same bench with the masses in thought.

The revolutionary committee of this factory has realized from practice that whether one appears before the masses as a member of the revolutionary committee or as a student is a very important issue. If one always thinks of oneself as a leader, one will inevitably become arrogant, and in thought, one will be separated from the masses. The members of the revolutionary committee are always alert to this point, always appearing before the masses as ordinary soldiers, participating in the struggle with the masses. Therefore, the masses are very satisfied. Workers say, "The revolutionary committee is good, good because it is close to the hearts of the people."

### 坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线  在阶级斗争中树立革委会的无产阶级权威

    坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    在阶级斗争中树立革委会的无产阶级权威
    天津市麻纺织厂革委会在解放军帮助下，把活学活用毛主席著作摆在首位，自觉地把自己放在让群众监督的位置上，威信越来越高。工人们说，革委会就是好，好就好在和群众心连心
    新华社天津二十六日电　天津市麻纺织厂革命委员会在驻厂人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中诞生以后，又在尖锐激烈的阶级斗争中得到了加强和巩固。一年多来，革委会的威信不断提高，革命职工高兴地说：“我们对革委会掌权就是放心”。在革委会的领导下，全厂上下团结一致，革命和生产蓬勃发展。全厂在连续十七个月完成国家计划之后，又提前七天超额完成了今年上半年的国家计划，生产已超过本厂历史上的最高水平。
  坚持贯彻毛主席革命路线才有无产阶级权威
    天津市麻纺织厂革委会不断巩固发展的事实证明，新生的革命委员会只有坚持贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能真正树立起无产阶级权威。这个厂的革委会建立之初，有的人想：革委会成员是全厂革命群众提名的，革委会是得到驻厂解放军支左人员支持的，它的成立是经过上级革委会批准的，自然就具有无产阶级权威了。但是，革委会的委员们不这样想。他们认为，革委会的诞生是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利，新生的革委会只有坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线，用毛泽东思想掌好权，才能树立起无产阶级权威。
    革委会成立后，一直把活学活用毛泽东思想摆在一切工作的首位，革委会成员带头学，带头用，用毛泽东思想来指导当前的革命大批判和对敌斗争。全厂每天有一个小时的学习毛主席著作的制度，革委会成员带头坚持，雷打不动。毛主席的最新指示一下来，革委会总是连夜反复学习，马上贯彻落实。厂里各部门、各班组结合阶级斗争实际，普遍开活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，革委会的成员带头到群众中去讲用，让群众给自己做鉴定。
    在向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻中，革委会在解放军支左人员的帮助下，首先办起了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的毛泽东思想学习班，用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，用毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的理论为指针，分析本厂阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向和新问题，放手发动革命群众。革委会成员在向阶级敌人进攻中亲上第一线，带领广大革命群众挖出了隐藏得很深的一小撮叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子，给全厂革命职工上了一堂极其深刻的阶级教育课。通过斗争，全厂革命群众更进一步看到，革委会真正是按照毛泽东思想办事，按照毛主席革命路线办事，因此更加信任、更加拥护革委会。
    在贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的过程中，在进行各项中心工作中，革委会的成员都是在第一线上。那里最困难，那里情况最复杂，他们就出现在那里。在捍卫毛主席革命路线的关键时刻，他们总是挺身而出。去年，社会上曾经有一度无政府主义思潮泛滥，阶级敌人妄图以破坏生产的手段来动摇新生的革委会。革委会成员同群众一起奋战，坚决顶住了这一股逆流，揭露和粉碎了阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，终于按月完成了国家计划。
      把自己摆在让群众监督的位置上
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员绝不可脱离群众，绝不可高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，而应当以普通劳动者的姿态，出现在群众面前，深入于群众之中，同群众打成一片。”革委会成员意识到，掌权以后，地位变了，但普通劳动者的本色决不能变。一定要自觉地把自己放在让群众监督的位置上。
    厂革委会成立不久，有的干部忙于事务，出现了脱离群众，脱离劳动的苗头，有的工人就写大字报提出了尖锐的批评。这张大字报引起了革委会成员的重视。大家认为，大字报批评的精神完全正确，他们立即写了大字报，欢迎群众的批评，并且做了检查。从此，革委会不但规定了干部参加集体生产劳动的制度，而且革委会成员还把全厂最脏最累的软麻工序和劈麻工序做为自己的劳动“基地”。
    革委会成员把群众的监督看作是对自己的最大支持。他们经常进行整风，听取群众的意见，主动检查自己的缺点错误。革委会每次开会，都要读毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人五项标准的指示，用毛主席的教导来要求自己，检查自己，鞭策自己。有一次，一个工人在车间里发现有人把一些药品随手扔掉了，他就找到革委会副主任周国良提意见，要求革委会要当家理财。周国良在大会上表扬了这位提意见的老工人，并且发动群众把各处糟蹋的药品收集起来，开了一个现场展览会，对全厂职工进行活的教育，群众反映很好。今年初，全厂医药费月月超支，由于反了浪费，五月份就出现了结余六百九十多元医药费的新气象。
    要从思想上和群众坐在一条板凳上
    这个厂的革委会深深体会到，革委会成员要做到“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，不但要同工人一起劳动，没有架子，生活上不特殊；更重要的是要在思想感情上同工人打成一片。在制订今年全年生产计划的时候，厂革委会考虑到今年设备要大修，计划高于一九六六年是可以的，但要超过最高水平的一九六七年就有困难。可是拿到工人中去讨论时，工人批评这个计划没有体现毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，重新把计划作了调整，革委会原订第二季度超产三万条麻袋，可是第一个月工人就超产了四万条。这件事深深教育了革委会成员，使大家进一步认识到革委会成员只有和群众想到一处，从思想上和群众坐在一条板凳上，才能做到永远不脱离群众。
    这个厂的革委会从实践中体会到，和群众在一起的时候，自己是以革委会成员的身份出现，还是以小学生的身份出现，这是一个极为重要的问题。如果脑子里总是想着自己是领导，必然就会“官大架子长”，从思想上就同群众分了家。革委会成员时刻警惕这一点，总是以普通一兵的身份同群众一起参加战斗，因此群众非常满意。工人们说，革委会就是好，好就好在和群众心连心。
