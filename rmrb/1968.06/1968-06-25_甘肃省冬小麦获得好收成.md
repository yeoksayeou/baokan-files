Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directives, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members in Gansu Province have been vigorously promoting revolution and production, achieving a bumper harvest of winter wheat. The spring wheat is also growing well, and a good harvest is in sight. The main winter wheat producing areas of Longnan and Longdong are now in the midst of the summer harvest peak, with good news of the harvest coming frequently. The winter wheat and other summer crops in Wudu, Tianshui, and Qingyang have a better yield than the bumper harvest of last year.
