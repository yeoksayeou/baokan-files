Albanian Labor Newspaper Denounces the Betrayal of the French Revisionist Leadership in Selling Out the Interests of the Working Class
French Revisionists Are Accomplices of the French Ruling Class in Suppressing Mass Movements

The official newspaper of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Albania, "Labor," published an article by Fatmir Dibra on June 14th, exposing and denouncing the betrayal of the French Communist Party revisionist leadership in selling out the interests of the working class and their efforts to serve the French monopolistic bourgeoisie in every possible way.

The article points out that the French bourgeoisie, frightened by the massive workers' strike, has mobilized all its forces, used its propaganda machine, and employed violence and gendarmes to pressure and blackmail the workers. They have also utilized old traitors from the Social Democratic Party and new traitors from modern revisionism to suppress the surging advance of the working class, control the workers, and attempt to confine the great movement of the working class within the bounds of economic demands, without harming the rule of the bourgeoisie. The French monopolistic bourgeoisie, relying on the leaders of the French Revisionist Party, Roger and his gang, and the manipulators of the French Revisionist General Confederation of Labor, has received their strong support.

The article points out that the stance of these bourgeois agents within the working class ranks has once again exposed their true colors. They have betrayed and sabotaged the struggle of the working class for freedom and their immediate rights, for liberation from the brutal oppression and exploitation of capitalism, and for breaking the shackles of capitalist slavery. They attempt to make the strike proceed peacefully within the legal framework of capitalism, without infringing upon the interests of the French big bourgeoisie. They negotiate and make deals with the bosses behind the workers' backs, attempting to stifle the revolutionary fervor and determination of the working class.

The article states that now, the leaders of the French Revisionists and the bribed union manipulators are hyping up the elections to be held in June. They will also nominate candidates to participate in the establishment of the so-called "People's Government" of the Democratic Alliance. The French Revisionists, in this regard, are in cahoots with the French bourgeois government. All these arrogant and frantic activities are merely aimed at rescuing the monopolistic bourgeoisie from its predicament. They abandon class struggle, socialist revolution, and the dictatorship of the proletariat, replacing them with the bourgeois and opportunist theory of class reconciliation, social reform, peaceful transition, and bourgeois freedom and democracy.

The article points out that in the events that have shaken all of France, the working class has seen more clearly the traitorous and renegade faces of the union manipulators. The working class regards them as the fire brigade of the bourgeoisie. No matter what conspiracies the French reactionary ruling clique, the French Revisionists, and the traitors of the French unions and workers' movement may hatch, the French working class, with its glorious revolutionary traditions and led by the new Marxist-Leninist forces, is continuing its struggle. This struggle is invincible.

    阿《劳动报》谴责法修领导集团出卖工人阶级利益的叛卖行径
    法修是法国统治阶级镇压群众运动的帮凶
    新华社地拉那十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会机关报《劳动报》十四日发表法特米尔·迪勃拉的一篇文章，揭露和谴责法共修正主义领导集团出卖工人阶级利益，千方百计为法国垄断资产阶级效劳的叛卖行径。
    文章指出，被声势浩大的工人罢工吓得惊慌不安的法国资产阶级，动员了一切力量，开动宣传机器，动用暴力和宪兵，对工人施加压力，进行讹诈；他们还利用老牌叛徒社会民主党人和新叛徒现代修正主义者，以遏制工人阶级汹涌澎湃的进攻，控制工人阶级，企图把工人阶级的伟大运动纳入一般的经济要求，使这一伟大运动不损害资产阶级的统治。法国垄断资产阶级依靠了法国修正主义党的头目罗歇及其一伙，依靠了法修总工会的操纵者，得到了他们有力的帮助。
    文章指出，在工人阶级队伍内的这些资产阶级代理人的立场，再次暴露了他们的原形，他们出卖和破坏工人阶级为争取自由和切身的权利，为从资本主义残酷的压迫和剥削下求得解放以及为打碎资本主义奴役枷锁而进行的斗争。他们企图使罢工在资本主义的法律范围内，在不触犯法国大资产阶级利益的情况下和平地开展。他们背着工人同企业主进行谈判和做交易，企图扼杀工人阶级的革命热情和决心。
    文章说，现在，法修头目和被收买的工会操纵者正把即将在六月份举行的选举捧上天。他们还将提名参加建立所谓民主联盟“人民政府”。法国修正主义者在这方面同法国资产阶级政府一唱一和。所有这一切嚣张和疯狂的活动，只不过是为了把垄断资产阶级从困境中解放出来罢了。他们放弃阶级斗争，放弃社会主义革命和无产阶级专政，而代之以资产阶级和机会主义的阶级调和的理论，代之以社会改良、和平过渡和资产阶级的自由民主。
    文章指出，在震撼整个法国的事件中，工人阶级更清楚地认清了工会操纵者的叛徒和变节者的嘴脸。工人阶级把他们看作是资产阶级的消防队。不管法国反动统治集团和法国修正主义者以及法国工会和工人运动的叛徒们施展什么阴谋，具有光荣革命传统、并以马克思列宁主义新生力量为首的法国工人阶级正在继续进行斗争。这一斗争是不可战胜的。
