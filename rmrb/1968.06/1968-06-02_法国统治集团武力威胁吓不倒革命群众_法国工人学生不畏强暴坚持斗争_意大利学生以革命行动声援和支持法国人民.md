The French ruling class's threats of force cannot intimidate the revolutionary masses. French workers and students fearlessly continue their struggle. Italian students support the French people with revolutionary actions.

New York, June 1, Xinhua News Agency: Paris reports that the French revolutionary people, carrying on the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, are fighting with high spirits. The French ruling class is using both force and deception to try to extinguish the flames of the people's struggle. The French revisionist traitor clique and various traitors and strikebreakers are working hard for the French ruling class. Meanwhile, thousands of Italian students held a massive demonstration in Rome and occupied the University of Rome, warmly supporting and aiding the French people's just struggle.

After French President de Gaulle's threatening speech to the revolutionary masses on the evening of May 30, the French government has taken a series of emergency measures in recent days, rapidly deploying troops, bringing tanks and infantry units into the Paris area to threaten the revolutionary masses. It also authorized the Minister of Armed Forces, Messmer, to mobilize the army, navy, air force, and gendarmerie reserves to create a climate of terror. On May 31, Paris police brutally drove away the striking pickets at the central radio station, occupied the station, and handed over France's international communications to the military. The French authorities also deployed police in Paris, Marseille, Metz, and other places to take similar actions against the postal workers' strike.

At the same time, the French ruling class reorganized the French government, pushing out Interior Minister Christian Fouchet, Justice Minister Louis Joxe, Information Minister Georges Gorse, Youth and Sports Minister François Missoffe, and National Education Minister Alain Peyrefitte as scapegoats, and announced parliamentary elections on June 23, attempting to use this to quell the people's anger. The French ruling class is also intensifying negotiations with various industry, regional, and major enterprise yellow union leaders, trying to make some minor economic concessions to divide and disintegrate the workers' ranks, and lure workers back to work.

Under the threats and enticements of the French ruling class, the French revisionist traitor clique and various yellow union leaders are currently engaged in frenzied betrayal activities, serving the French monopolistic bourgeoisie. The French revisionist Political Bureau issued a statement on the evening of May 31, reiterating its support for the elections organized by the French government, and eagerly expressed that it would "propose its own candidates" to participate in the elections. Some industry and enterprise yellow union leaders announced on May 31 that they had reached "agreements" with the government and capitalists. Some of them, according to Pompidou's instructions, are coercing and enticing workers to divide the workers' fighting ranks and sabotage the strike struggle.

French progressive workers are resolutely fighting against the shameful actions of the French revisionist traitor clique and yellow union leaders who betray the interests of the revolutionary people. Currently, the vast majority of French workers are still on strike, and France's economic life remains paralyzed.

In recent days, workers and students across France have held meetings and marches to protest the French government's blatant threats to deploy the military against the revolutionary masses. In Nantes, more than 20,000 workers, agricultural workers, and students held a protest meeting and march on May 31. On June 1, Paris students called on workers, students, and teachers to unite and hold demonstrations and marches to launch a mass counterattack against the French ruling class. The General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the French revisionists, immediately jumped out again to prohibit workers from demonstrating with students and ordered its affiliated unions to intensify negotiations with the government and employers to resume work.

Just as French revolutionary workers and students fearlessly continue their struggle, Italian students in Rome, taking Paris students as an example, took mass revolutionary actions to support the French people's just struggle. Thousands of students in Rome occupied the University of Rome on May 31. They hung banners at the school gate: "France has started, now we must act."

Rome students distributed a large number of leaflets condemning the French revisionists' betrayal of the French people. The leaflets pointed out, "The opportunist policy of the French Communist Party (referring to the French revisionists) is to suppress the development of the French people's revolutionary struggle." The French revisionists and the General Confederation of Labor they control "attempt to bring the revolutionary forces of students and workers into the specific demands of the union, playing a counter-revolutionary role." The leaflets also called on Italian students not to limit themselves to demonstrations in support of the French people but to "attack the bourgeois power in Italy."

That evening, more than 5,000 students in Rome, carrying red flags, held a demonstration in front of the French Embassy to support the French people. When Italian police brutally suppressed the demonstrators, the students used overturned cars and tables to build barricades and bravely fought back. Several dozen students were injured. The Italian authorities also arbitrarily arrested a large number of demonstrators. Rome students decided to hold a meeting on June 1 to protest the police brutality.

In Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, more than 100 Dutch youths also demonstrated in front of the French consulate on May 31 to support the just struggle of French workers and students.

The revolutionary storm of mass struggles in France and other Western European countries is increasingly fiercely impacting the reactionary rule of these countries. The United Press International despondently wrote, "Western leaders" are anxiously watching "the turmoil in France." "The European Community, the Western Alliance, and the entire free world (referring to the capitalist world) line have been shaken by this turmoil in France." This American bourgeois news agency also lamented that the revolutionary actions of French students "have already spread to neighboring countries, and the consequences are unpredictable."

    法国统治集团武力威胁吓不倒革命群众
    法国工人学生不畏强暴坚持斗争
    意大利学生以革命行动声援和支持法国人民
    新华社一日讯　巴黎消息：继承着巴黎公社光荣革命传统的法国革命人民，斗志昂扬地继续坚持斗争。法国统治集团加紧使用武力威胁和欺骗收买的反革命两手，力图扑灭法国人民的斗争烈火。法国修正主义叛徒集团以及形形色色的叛徒、工贼，竭尽全力为法国统治集团奔走效劳。与此同时，数千名意大利学生在罗马举行声势浩大的示威游行并占领了罗马大学，热烈声援和支持法国人民的正义斗争。
    在法国总统戴高乐五月三十日晚发表威胁革命群众的电视广播演说以后，法国政府连日来采取了一系列紧急措施，加紧调兵遣将，把坦克和步兵部队调进巴黎地区，威胁革命群众。它还授权武装部队部长梅斯梅尔出动陆、海、空三军和宪兵后备人员，制造恐怖气氛。巴黎的警察五月三十一日蛮横地赶走中央电台的罢工纠察队，占领了电台，让军队接管了法国同外国的通讯联络工作。法国当局还在巴黎、马赛、梅斯等地，出动警察对当地的邮电局采取类似的作法，破坏邮电工人的罢工。
    与此同时，法国统治集团改组了法国政府，把内政部长克里斯吉安·伏歇、司法部长路易·若克斯、宣传部长乔治·戈尔斯、体育运动和青年部长弗郎索瓦·米索夫以及国民教育部长阿兰·佩雷菲特五人推出来作为替罪羊，让他们去职下台，并宣布在六月二十三日进行议会选举，妄图借此平息人民的愤怒。法国统治集团还加紧同各行业、各地区、各大企业黄色工会头目进行谈判，力图在经济上再作一些微小的让步，分化瓦解工人的队伍，诱骗工人复工。
    在法国统治集团的恫吓和拉拢下，法修叛徒集团和法国各黄色工会的头目，目前正在进行狂热的叛卖活动，为法国垄断资产阶级效劳。法修的政治局五月三十一日晚再次发表声明，重申它支持法国政府组织的这次大选，并迫不及待地表示它即将
  “提出它自己的候选人”，参加竞选。一些行业和企业的黄色工会头目五月三十一日已宣布同政府和资本家达成“协议”。其中有些人还按照蓬皮杜的旨意，对工人大肆威迫利诱，以分化工人的战斗队伍，破坏罢工斗争。
    法国进步的工人正在同法修叛徒集团和黄色工会头目出卖革命人民利益的可耻行径进行坚决的斗争。目前，法国广大的工人群众仍在坚持罢工，法国的经济生活仍然陷于瘫痪状态。
    法国各地的工人和学生这两天纷纷举行集会游行，抗议法国政府调动军队对革命群众进行露骨的威胁。在南特，两万多工人、农业工人和学生五月三十一日举行了抗议集会和游行。巴黎学生六月一日呼吁工人、学生和教师团结起来，举行示威游行，对法国统治集团进行群众性的反击。法修控制的总工会马上又一次跳出来禁止工人同学生一起示威游行，并命令它属下的工会加紧同政府和资方谈判复工。
    正当法国革命工人和学生不畏强暴地坚持斗争的时候，意大利罗马学生以巴黎的学生为榜样，采取了群众性的革命行动，来支持法国人民的正义斗争。罗马学生数千人，五月三十一日占领了罗马大学。他们在校园门口挂上横幅标语：“法国开了头，现在我们必须行动。”
    罗马学生散发了大量传单，谴责法修出卖法国人民的罪行。传单指出，“法国共产党（指法修）的机会主义政策是在遏制法国群众革命斗争的发展。”法修及其控制的总工会“企图把学生和工人的革命力量纳入工会具体要求的轨道，起了反革命的作用”。传单还呼吁意大利学生不要只限于举行声援法国人民的示威，而要“向意大利的资产阶级权力进攻”。
    当天晚上，罗马学生五千多人打着红旗，在法国大使馆前举行声援法国人民的示威。当意大利警察悍然镇压示威群众时，学生们用翻倒的汽车和桌椅等筑起街垒，同警察英勇搏斗。有几十个学生被打伤。意大利当局还无理逮捕了大批示威者。罗马学生已决定在六月一日集会，抗议警察的暴行。
    在荷兰的首都阿姆斯特丹，一百多名荷兰青年五月三十一日也在法国领事馆前示威，支持法国工人、学生的正义斗争。
    法国和其他西欧国家群众斗争的革命风暴，日益猛烈地冲击着这些国家的反动统治。合众国际社沮丧地写道，“西方领导人”今天不安地注视着“闹得翻天覆地”的法国。“西欧共同体、西方联盟和整个自由世界（指资本主义世界）阵线都由于法国的这次动乱而受到震动”。这家美国资产阶级通讯社还哀叹，法国学生的革命行动“业已蔓延到邻国，其后果如何尚无法预料”。（附图片）
