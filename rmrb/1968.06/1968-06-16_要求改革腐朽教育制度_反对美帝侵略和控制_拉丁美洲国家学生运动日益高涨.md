Students in several Latin American countries are continuing their struggle to reform corrupt educational systems and to break free from U.S. imperialist control.

On June 14, university students in Buenos Aires, Rosario, La Plata, Tucuman, and other cities in Argentina held a large-scale strike and demonstration to protest the Ongania pro-American dictatorship's abolition of university autonomy and suppression of the student movement. Striking students bravely fought against the reactionary police.

Students in Buenos Aires carried red flags and banners with slogans opposing the pro-American dictatorship, marching through the streets. The reactionary police used tear gas and batons to suppress the students. However, the university students fearlessly fought back, throwing homemade incendiary bombs at the police's armored vehicles. Students in Rosario also held demonstrations and burned the dean of the medical school's car. Students in Tucuman on strike called on local workers to hold a grand demonstration on June 29, the second anniversary of Ongania's coup.

Earlier, 400 law students in La Plata occupied the university administration building on June 12 to protest the authorities' brutal suppression of students' legitimate activities. The reactionary authorities sent in a large number of police, who attacked the students with dogs, batons, and tear gas, injuring many students and arresting several. These brutal actions provoked more students to resist. When the reactionary police tried to drive away the 400 students, about 1,000 more students gathered outside to support their classmates' just actions.

Brave Brazilian students have been tirelessly fighting against American cultural aggression and dictatorship. On the night of June 12, about 1,000 students from the University of São Paulo stormed the dean's office, demanding educational reforms and reaffirming their opposition to the Brazilian pro-American dictatorship's signing of a cultural "aid" agreement with U.S. imperialism. Students from six departments of the University of Rio de Janeiro began an indefinite strike on June 13 to protest insufficient educational funds.

In Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, about 2,000 students, despite the reactionary police's suppression, marched through the city's main streets on June 12 to demand increased educational funds, protest rising living costs, and strongly demand that the government sever ties with the U.S.-controlled International Monetary Fund.

The demonstrating students, despite the reactionary police's tear gas and water cannons, overturned cars on the street, built barricades, and fought fiercely with the reactionary police until late that night. Earlier, several thousand students had held demonstrations with striking workers.

On June 13, professors and teachers across Uruguay announced a two-day strike to support the students' brave struggle.

Approximately 25,000 students at the Central University of Venezuela held a strike on June 13 to support veterinary and other students' demand for increased educational funds. These students have been demanding this for a long time and have stated that they will continue to strike until their demands are met.

    要求改革腐朽教育制度　反对美帝侵略和控制
    拉丁美洲国家学生运动日益高涨
    新华社十五日讯　拉丁美洲一些国家的学生要求改革腐朽的教育制度和摆脱美帝国主义控制的斗争正在继续发展。
    阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯和罗萨里奥、拉普拉塔、图库曼等城市的大学学生六月十四日举行大罢课和示威游行，抗议翁加尼亚亲美独裁政府废除大学自治和镇压学生运动。罢课学生同反动警察进行了英勇的搏斗。
    布宜诺斯艾利斯的大学学生高举红旗和写着反对亲美独裁政权的标语牌，上街举行示威。反动警察用催泪瓦斯和警棍镇压学生。但是大学生们不畏强暴，英勇进行反击，向警察局的装甲车投掷土制燃烧弹。罗萨里奥城的大学生也举行示威，他们还烧掉了医学院院长的汽车。图库曼罢课学生呼吁当地工人在六月二十九日翁加尼亚发动政变上台两周年的这一天举行盛大示威。
    在这以前，拉普拉塔的四百名法律系学生在六月十二日占领了大学办公楼，抗议当局蛮横压制学生的正当活动。反动当局出动大批警察，用警犬、棍棒和催泪瓦斯袭击学生，打伤了好多学生并且逮捕了许多人。这些残暴行动激起了更多学生的反抗。当反动警察企图赶走那四百名学生的时候，门外面又集结了大约一千名学生，声援同学们的正义行动。
    英勇的巴西学生一直在为反对美国文化侵略、反对独裁进行着不懈的斗争。在十二日晚，圣保罗大学的约一千名学生愤怒地冲向校长室，要求改革教育制度，重申反对巴西亲美独裁政权同美帝国主义签订的文化“援助”协定。里约热内卢大学六个系的学生从十三日起又举行不定期罢课，抗议教育经费不足。
    在乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚，大约有两千名学生不顾反动警察的镇压，十二日冲向这个城市的主要街道举行示威游行，要求增加教育经费，抗议生活费用上涨，强烈要求政府同美国控制的国际货币基金组织断绝关系。
    示威的学生冒着反动警察施放的催泪瓦斯和水龙，推翻了街上的汽车，筑起街垒，同反动警察进行了激烈的搏斗，直到当天深夜。在这以前，有几千名学生同罢工工人一起举行了示威集会。
    十三日，乌拉圭各地的教授和教员宣布举行两天总罢教，支持学生的英勇斗争。
    委内瑞拉中央大学约两万五千名学生，十三日举行总罢课，支持兽医等系学生提出增加教育经费的要求。这些学生很久以前就提出了这个要求，他们表示，在这一要求没有得到满足以前，他们将继续罢课。
