		Fiberglass Oxygen Cylinders

		The workers of the Hangzhou Reinforced Plastics Factory have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and insisted on the path of self-reliance. After more than two years of effort, they have successfully developed a 40-liter fiberglass oxygen cylinder.

		Oxygen cylinders are indispensable containers in industrial and agricultural production, medical and health services, and national defense construction, and are usually made of alloy steel. The fiberglass oxygen cylinders produced by this factory use glass fiber as the main raw material. They are about half the weight of steel cylinders, convenient to use, and have a wide range of applications. They will greatly support industrial and agricultural production, medical and health services, and national defense construction.
