Nanjing City's workers, revolutionary teachers and students, and cadre from various organizations have formed a massive support-agriculture army to assist people's communes with summer harvest and planting.

Before heading to the countryside to aid in the summer harvest and planting, the comrades studied Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions repeatedly. Revolutionary youngsters from institutions of higher learning such as Nanjing University and Nanjing Institute of Technology, as well as some middle schools, also diligently studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "The Orientation of the Youth Movement" and "The May Fourth Movement," along with the "May 7th Directive." Upon arriving in the countryside, the support-agriculture army actively participated in labor while closely linking the class struggle in the suburban countryside to the actual situation. They enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought and the brilliant deeds of Comrade Lei Feng, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, criticized the heinous crimes committed by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangsu who had been promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

Many leaders from various levels of revolutionary committees took the lead in participating in the activities to support the suburban summer harvest and planting.
