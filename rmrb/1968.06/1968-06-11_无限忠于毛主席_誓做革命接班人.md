"Navigating the seas requires a helmsman, revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought."

On the revolutionary path, it is the great Mao Zedong Thought that has illuminated my way forward; it is the great Mao Zedong Thought that has nurtured me, a new recruit in the revolutionary ranks, to grow continuously. Over the past six years, from soldier to platoon leader, my position has changed greatly; however, the demands of the proletarian revolutionary cause on me have not changed. I have always faced a fundamental question: how to arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought, accelerate the revolutionization of my thoughts, and cultivate myself into a successor of the proletarian revolutionary cause who is eternally loyal to Chairman Mao?

To the most perilous struggles, forge a heart eternally loyal to Chairman Mao

In 1960, I entered the People's Liberation Army, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought. In the army, the leaders educated me, and my comrades helped me, making me begin to understand: to cultivate myself into a revolutionary successor who is eternally loyal to Chairman Mao, I must strive to study Chairman Mao's works and focus on the "use" of them. From then on, I seized every opportunity to study diligently. I memorized the "Five Articles" and Chairman Mao's quotations relevant to my thoughts and work, and whenever I encountered problems, I would try to use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and solve them. Gradually, I formed a habit and increased my self-awareness. When faced with a task, I would first consider whether it aligns with Mao Zedong Thought. If it does, I would resolutely, wholeheartedly, and lead the way to accomplish it; if it does not, I would resolutely not do it. I feel that a revolutionary soldier must strive to act according to Mao Zedong Thought in every word and deed, which is the deepest love and greatest loyalty to Chairman Mao.

We are an engineering platoon, often dealing with difficulties and dangers. When faced with difficulties and dangers, do we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, fear no sacrifice, and press forward; or do we fear this and that, retreat, and not advance? This is the best test of our active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Over the years, in the struggle against difficulties and dangers, I deeply feel that: the more difficult the place, the better the battlefield for struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism; the more difficult the place, the better the classroom for actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works; the more dangerous the place, the better the red furnace for forging a heart eternally loyal to Chairman Mao. I made a vow to myself: my red heart will always be with Chairman Mao, my loyal heart will always be for the people; where there are difficulties, I will go; where there are dangers, I will charge!

Last winter, our platoon was given an urgent task to repair a dam's sluice gate that night. The troops arrived at the scene, and the biting north wind made everyone shiver; the reservoir still had over a meter of ice water, and the water flow was rapid. Who would jump into the water first? I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do." I briefly mobilized the troops and jumped into the water first. Then, the comrades also jumped into the water one after another. I and the comrades fought in the ice water all night, freezing so badly that we could not speak, but we finally repaired the sluice gate on time.

Last year, when the army was building houses, we were responsible for caulking and carrying cement roof panels. Caulking was relatively easy, while carrying roof panels was both hard and dangerous. Each cement roof panel weighed several hundred pounds, with some over a thousand pounds. Four people carried it, had to climb the slope, go up to the roof, and then walk a section of brick wall only about twenty centimeters wide. If not careful, both the person and the panel would fall down. Which job should I do? As a platoon leader, I had to work and command, and no one would say anything if I went to caulk. However, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on choosing the heaviest burden, and my face turned hot. I picked up the pole and carried the cement roof panels with the soldiers for the whole morning. The comrades took turns resting, but I did not rest.

Although this construction was tiring, making my waist and legs ache, I felt especially comfortable and happy when I thought that I had firmly executed Chairman Mao's teachings, overcome the "self" in my mind, cultivated revolutionary will, and forged a heart eternally loyal to Chairman Mao.

Once, the river upstream of our garrison thawed, but the ice near the "May 1st" bridge had not completely melted, blocking the river's flow. The river water quickly overflowed the riverbed, rushing towards the cement-plated road west of the bridge, washing away the foundation under several cement plates. The leadership decided to blow up two cement plates, creating an opening to let the surging river flow down and save this important road.

I led ten soldiers to carry out the demolition task. It was pitch black, and when we shone a flashlight, we saw the river water pouring down like a waterfall. The foundation under the two cement plates was almost washed away. Seeing this, my mind was in turmoil! I thought, to crawl under the hollowed-out cement plates to place explosives, if the thousand-pound cement plates collapse, the person would be crushed into a meat patty; even if the cement plates do not collapse, the cold water would freeze the person, and if the explosives detonate prematurely, there would be no time to escape.

The river water was rising rapidly, and the demolition task was urgent. For such a dangerous task, should I let the comrades complete it, or should I go myself? At that moment, my thoughts were in turmoil. I thought of the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "To strive is to have sacrifices," "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai," and the heroic deeds of Huang Jiguang, Dong Cunrui, Lei Feng, and Wang Jie, and what I often told the comrades: to be eternally loyal to Chairman Mao, to be eternally loyal to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Suddenly, I was full of energy and courage. I said to myself: Gao Yinxue, Gao Yinxue! Now is the time for you to fulfill your promise with actual actions!

I did not have time to take off my padded clothes and jumped into the waist-deep ice water. Soon, Luo Yusheng and Luo Haixian also jumped in. I and Luo Haixian quickly crawled under the cement plates and placed the fifty-kilogram explosive box in the predetermined position. However, there was still a gap between the explosive box and the cement plate, which would affect the full effectiveness of the explosives. To ensure the success of the explosion, we also had to fill the gap above the explosive box with stones. The stones had to be passed in one by one from outside, filling this gap, which would take a lot of time! At this time, under the fierce impact of the river water, the foundation was being washed away more and more, and the danger of the cement plates collapsing was increasing. The longer we stayed under, the more dangerous it was. However, we thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, "extreme responsibility to work, extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people," and that the success or failure of this task was related to the interests of the country and the people, and the smooth progress of the army's central task. We completely forgot about our personal safety. We shouted, "Determine to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." After thirty minutes of intense battle, under the command of the superior leadership and the cooperation of the comrades, we finally filled the stones and completed the preparation for the explosion.

Who would stay inside to light the fuse? No one was willing to leave. At that time, the north wind was howling, the ice water was piercing, freezing our teeth and bodies. Staying inside to light the fuse was very dangerous. I ordered Luo Haixian to come out first and stayed inside to light the fuse. However, nothing could be seen inside, and the fuse was damp, taking a long time to light. At this time, the comrades outside and I together loudly recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "This army has an indomitable spirit, it wants to crush all enemies and will never be subdued by enemies. No matter in any difficult and dangerous situation, as long as there is one person, this person will continue to fight." The radiant Mao Zedong Thought illuminated my heart and the entire demolition site. I calmly lit the fuse again and again, finally lighting the fuse.

When we completed the task and climbed out, our clothes were frozen stiff, our hair was frozen, our legs could not bend, and we could not even get into the car. The comrades said we had become "ice people," but my heart was warm. In this arduous battle, I once again tasted the sweetness of overcoming dangers with Mao Zedong Thought and further felt the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought.

I often think: our revolutionary predecessors, following the great leader Chairman Mao, went through long-term arduous struggles and created the proletarian revolutionary cause. We, the youth of this generation, want to cultivate ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, like our revolutionary predecessors, bravely take on heavy burdens for the revolution, consciously throw ourselves into the most arduous and dangerous struggles, constantly forge a heart eternally loyal to Chairman Mao, cultivate the revolutionary spirit of dedicating oneself to the proletarian liberation cause, and strive to be a revolutionary soldier worthy of the great Mao Zedong era.

Under the supervision and help of the masses, forever maintain the revolutionary character of a proletarian soldier

Over the years, my class consciousness has improved, and I can do some work for the Party, which is the result of Mao Zedong Thought nurturing and the enthusiastic help of the masses.

There is one thing I will never forget: last year, the organization decided to make me the platoon leader. On one hand, I was happy for the Party's trust in me; on the other hand, I had many concerns, fearing that my level was low and I could not do it, worrying that my fellow soldiers who enlisted at the same time as me would not be convinced. I never expected that on the night the organization announced my appointment as platoon leader, I found a note in my notebook with the following words: "The promotion of position is the need of the revolution. For the revolution, you must be more active and responsible, and hold the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought higher. Drive the car steadily, hold the steering wheel straight. Check the machine parts regularly, keep the engine running normally, ..." The signature at the bottom was "your soldier."

I read this note several times, the more I read, the more excited I became, my heart seemed to jump out of my chest, and I could not sleep at all. What a sincere class sentiment, what a good revolutionary comrade! This is not only the support of a soldier to me, but also the care, encouragement, and exhortation of all the comrades in the platoon to me! This matter gave me great enlightenment: this platoon leader is not just me leading; in a certain sense, every comrade in the platoon is leading. The key is whether I can believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the comrades. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, and the enthusiastic support of the masses, what is there to fear about my low level?! Thinking of this, my worries and concerns vanished. I copied this passage into my notebook, remembered it in my mind, often looked at it, thought about it, and used it as a driving force to keep moving forward.

Looking back at my work over the years, whenever I consciously followed the lead, relied on the masses, and acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings, things were done better, and tasks were completed more smoothly. Last spring, the soldiers proposed to turn the platoon's garrison into a great classroom of Mao Zedong Thought. At that time, I had a "difficult" thought: our platoon moves every few days, and there are not enough portraits and quotations of Chairman Mao, how can we arrange it? I discussed it with the soldiers, and the result was that the third squad's comrades worked overnight, everyone joined in, collected Chairman Mao's photos and quotations from newspapers, cut and pasted, and quickly turned the platoon's garrison into a red place.

After the newspaper began to criticize Liu Shaoqi, the comrades were eager to join this serious battle. However, the superiors had not arranged it yet, the political instructor was not at home, and I had never done it before, so I was anxious and had no way out. Later, I held a meeting and asked the soldiers for advice. At the meeting, everyone spoke, and the solution came out quickly. The comrades wanted to write big-character posters, but the platoon had no paper, so the soldiers brought some waste wood, five pieces together, and wrote big slogans and big-character posters with lime water, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi. In this way, the criticism movement quickly developed in our platoon.

There are too many such examples, and it would take days to talk about them all. In the process of fighting together with the comrades, I have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's teachings: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable," and thousands of difficulties can be overcome by relying on the masses.

In the few years I have been a cadre, not only have I received strong support and enthusiastic help from the soldiers in my work, but I have also continuously absorbed rich ideological nutrition from the soldiers and received profound education. When I first became a deputy platoon leader, once after work, I led the troops back. Suddenly, a thought flashed in my mind: I am now a cadre of the platoon, walking on the street in clothes rolled with mud, how embarrassing! This unhealthy thought immediately showed up in my actions. In the afternoon, working with the soldiers to carry mud and plaster the roof, I dodged and hid, afraid that the mud would stain my clothes. The comrades noticed my thoughts and joked: "Be careful, don't get the mud on the deputy platoon leader!" This sentence touched my sore spot. I took this issue to study Chairman Mao's works, using the quotation "Our Party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people" to examine myself, and I realized: fearing to get mud on me is precisely because there is "mud" in my thoughts. With the promotion of my position, my bourgeois thoughts began to rise, and "officialdom" grew. This is a dangerous sign. Now fearing to get mud on me, in the future, I will detach from labor, detach from the masses, and if it develops, I may fall into the quagmire of revisionism. I am deeply grateful to the comrades for their care and help for me. I made up my mind: I must use practical actions to wash away the "mud" in my thoughts and not disappoint the Party and the comrades' expectations. From then on, I lived in the squad for a long time, just like when I was a soldier, living and working with the comrades. Whatever the soldiers did, I did; the dirtier, heavier, and more dangerous the work, the more I rushed to do and did more. Over time, I heard the comrades praise me: "The platoon leader, except for the belt, is the same as us. We have as much mud on us as the platoon leader has. He hasn't changed!" I felt: this is the greatest encouragement from the masses to me, and it is also the goal I should continue to strive for. The more mud I roll in, the less "mud" there is in my thoughts; the more mud I roll in, the deeper the class feelings with the soldiers; forever rolling in the mud with the masses, I can forever maintain the character of a proletarian revolutionary soldier and build a long wall against revisionism in my mind.

I do not always accept the masses' criticism and help well. Good suggestions and methods proposed by the masses are relatively easy to accept; criticism and opinions proposed by the masses, especially those sharp criticisms that hit the mark, are often difficult to understand. Once, the regiment approved our platoon and several other units to demolish dilapidated houses and build toilets. I mobilized everyone in the platoon to go early, saying that if we went late, we would not get the "benefits." The third squad leader, Ren Suobao, sharply criticized me, saying I was a narrow-minded sectarian. At that time, I did not fully understand this issue and did not well accept his opinion, thoroughly cleaning up this thought. At the year-end evaluation, I took this issue to study Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Narrow-minded sectarianism is 'only paying attention to the interests of one's own small group, not paying attention to the overall interests, seemingly not for oneself, but actually containing extremely narrow individualism, which also has a great corrosive and centrifugal effect.' Chairman Mao's teachings helped me root out the "self" in my mind, making me realize the seriousness of this issue. With the help of the comrades, I also actively checked other similar mistakes, thoroughly cleaning up my narrow-minded sectarian tendencies in my thoughts.

The great teacher Chairman Mao humbly said: "With all the comrades in the Party, we will continue to learn from the masses and be a student forever. This is my wish." Every time I study this quotation, my heart is always very excited. Can we correctly treat the masses? Fundamentally, it is a big issue of whether we can implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and it is also a big issue of whether we can carry on the baton of Mao Zedong Thought. I am determined to follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "consult with the masses on everything, be a student of the masses." Forever let myself take root among the masses. Under the supervision and help of the masses, continue to advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao!

Comrade Lin Biao instructed us: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution must also revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not be good." From my own growth process, I feel that this is a true truth. Only by igniting a revolution in the depths of one's soul, fighting against the "self," can one play a role in the revolutionary cause and truly cultivate oneself into a successor of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Over the years, I have deeply felt that actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "use" of them, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform oneself, is a long-term arduous task, a lifelong endeavor, and it is not something that can be achieved once and for all. The revolutionary road is endless, and the transformation of thoughts is boundless. Only by being unsatisfied with the status quo, constantly dividing oneself, and constantly revolutionizing oneself, can one continue to advance. The enemy in one's thoughts, like all reactionaries, is cowardly and fears strength. To defeat it, one must fight offensively and fight it resolutely. The more one fights, the more one improves; the less one fights, the less one improves; if one does not fight, one will only be a prisoner.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls. The more the revolution advances, the more prominent and sharp the contradiction between "public" and "self" becomes. As long as one's thoughts relax a bit, there is the danger of falling into the quagmire of "self." I will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism," and I am determined to study Mao Zedong Thought for a lifetime, use Mao Zedong Thought for a lifetime, and fight against "self" for a lifetime. On the battlefield of ideological transformation, I will hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and be a fearless warrior who charges into the enemy's ranks.

    无限忠于毛主席　誓做革命接班人
    中国人民解放军国防科委活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、某部连长　高引学
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”
    在革命的道路上，是伟大的毛泽东思想，给我照亮了前进的方向；是伟大的毛泽东思想，哺育着我这个革命队伍里的新兵不断成长。入伍六年来，从战士到连长，我的职务有了很大变化；然而，无产阶级革命事业对我的要求没有变。我始终面临着一个根本的问题：怎样用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，加速思想革命化，把自己培养成一个无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命事业的接班人？
    到最艰险的斗争中去不断锤炼忠于毛主席的一颗红心
    一九六○年，我进入了人民解放军这个毛泽东思想的大学校。在部队里，首长教育我，同志们帮助我，使我开始懂得：要把自己培养成无限忠于毛主席的革命接班人，必须努力学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。从此，我就利用一切时间，见缝插针，抓紧学习。我把“老五篇”和针对自己思想、工作的毛主席语录读熟、背熟，遇到问题，就学着运用毛泽东思想来分析、解决。这样慢慢地养成了习惯，提高了自觉性。一事当前，首先想想是不是符合毛泽东思想，符合毛泽东思想的，我就坚决干，拚命干，带头干；不符合的，我坚决不干。我觉得：一个革命战士，只有每句话，每个行动，都努力按照毛泽东思想办事，才是对毛主席最深的爱，最大的忠。
    我们是工兵连队，经常和困难危险打交道。在困难和危险面前，是按照毛主席的教导，不怕牺牲，一往直前，踩着困难走，顶着险情上；还是怕这怕那，退缩不前？这是对我们活学活用毛主席著作最好的考验。几年来，在和困难危险作斗争的过程中，我深深体会到：哪里最艰苦，哪里就是我们斗私批修的好战场；哪里最困难，哪里就是我们活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂；哪里最危险，哪里就是我们锤炼忠于毛主席的一颗红心的红色熔炉。我自己暗暗立下誓言：红心永向毛主席，赤胆忠心为人民；哪里有困难到哪里去，哪里有危险往哪里冲！
    前年冬天，我们连接受了一个紧急任务，要在当夜修好一个水库的闸门。部队赶到现场，刺骨的北风，吹得大家直打哆嗦；水库里还有一米多深的冰水，水流很急。谁先下水呢？我想起毛主席的教导：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”我向部队作了简单的动员，就带头跳进水里。接着，同志们也纷纷跳下水。我和同志们在冰水里坚持战斗了一个通宵，冻得话都说不出来了，终于按时修好了闸门。
    去年部队盖房子，有一次，我们连担任勾缝子和抬水泥屋面板。勾缝子的活比较轻，抬屋面板，又累又危险。每块水泥屋面板，轻的几百斤，重的上千斤。四个人抬着，要爬坡道，上屋顶，还要走一段只有二十几厘米宽的砖墙，弄不好就会连人带板摔下去。两样活我干哪样？我是连长，要劳动，又要指挥，去勾缝子也不会有人说什么。但是，我想到毛主席关于拣重担子挑的教导，顿时脸上火辣辣的。我拿起杠子，就和战士们一起去抬屋面板，整整坚持抬了一个上午。同志们轮换休息，我也没有休息。
    这次施工，虽然累得腰酸腿疼，但是，一想到自己坚决执行了毛主席的教导，战胜了头脑里的“私”字，培养了革命意志，锤炼了忠于毛主席的一颗红心，心里就感到特别舒坦，特别愉快。
    有一次，我们驻地附近的一条河上游解冻了，但是，“五一”桥附近的冰还没有完全溶化，堵住了河水的去路。河水很快漫出河床，直冲桥西用水泥板铺成的公路，把十几块水泥板下面的路基都冲坏了。领导上决定炸掉两块水泥板，打开一个缺口，让汹涌的河水奔泻下去，保住这一条重要的公路。
    我带着十个战士去执行爆破任务。天黑得伸手不见五指。用电筒一照，只见河水象瀑布一样往公路下面的洼地倾泻。两块水泥板宽的路基几乎被冲光了。看到这种情景，我脑子里就翻腾开啦！心想，要从淘空了的水泥板下面钻进去放炸药，上千斤重的水泥板一塌下来，人就会被压成肉饼；即使水泥板塌不下来，天冷水寒，人冻僵了，棉衣冻硬了，万一炸药提前起爆，连跑都来不及。
    河水越涨越猛，爆炸任务刻不容缓。这样艰险的任务，是让同志们去完成，还是自己去完成？当时，我的思想斗争很激烈。我想到伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“要奋斗就会有牺牲”，“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”，想到黄继光、董存瑞、雷锋、王杰等同志的英雄事迹，想到自己对同志们常讲的：要无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于无产阶级的革命事业，顿时浑身是劲，勇气倍增。我对自己说：高引学啊，高引学！现在正是你用实际行动实现自己的诺言的时候！
    我顾不得脱掉棉衣，立刻跳进齐腰深的冰水里。随后，罗玉生、罗海先两个同志也跳了下去。我和罗海先迅速钻进水泥板底下，把五十公斤的炸药箱放到了预定的位置。可是，炸药箱和水泥板之间还有一段空隙，这会影响炸药充分发挥威力。为了保证爆炸成功，还要在炸药箱上面填满石块。石块要从外面一块一块往里递，填满这个空隙，需要多少时间！这时候，在河水的猛烈冲击下，路基越淘越空，水泥板下塌的危险越来越大。在底下多呆一分钟，就多一分危险。但是，我们想到毛主席的教导“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”，想到这个任务完成得好坏，关系到国家和人民的利益，关系到部队中心任务的顺利进行，就把个人的安危完全丢在了脑后。我们高喊着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”经过三十分钟的紧张战斗，在上级领导的指挥和同志们的配合下，终于填好了石块，完成了爆炸的准备工作。
    谁留在里面点火呢？我们谁也不肯走。当时，北风呼啸，冰水刺骨，冻得我们牙齿打战，身体发僵，留在里面点火是有很大危险性的。我命令罗海先同志先出来，自己留在里面点火。可是里面什么也看不见，导火索又受了潮，好长时间点不着。这时，外面的同志和我一起高声背诵毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”光芒四射的毛泽东思想，把我的心照得亮堂堂，把整个爆破现场照得红彤彤。我镇定地一次又一次地点火，终于点着了导火索。
    当我们完成任务爬上来的时候，衣服冻硬了，头发结了冰，两条腿打不了弯，连汽车都上不去了。同志们说我们成了“冰人”，可我心里却是热呼呼的。在这场艰苦的战斗中，我再一次尝到了用毛泽东思想战胜艰险的甜头，更进一步体会到毛泽东思想的无比威力。
    我常常想：我们的革命前辈，跟着伟大领袖毛主席，经过长期艰苦的斗争，开创了无产阶级的革命事业。我们这一代青年，要把自己培养成无产阶级革命事业的可靠的接班人，就要遵照毛主席的教导，象革命前辈那样，为革命勇挑重担，自觉地投身到最艰苦、最危险的斗争中去，不断锤炼自己无限忠于毛主席的一颗红心，培养为无产阶级解放事业英勇献身的革命精神，努力做一个无愧于伟大的毛泽东时代的革命战士。
    在群众的监督帮助下永远保持无产阶级战士的革命本色
    几年来，我的阶级觉悟有了一定的提高，能为党做一些工作，是毛泽东思想哺育的结果，也是广大群众热情帮助的结果。
    有件事我一辈子也忘不了：去年，组织上决定叫我当连长。我一方面为党对我的信任而高兴；另一方面又顾虑重重，怕自己水平低干不了，担心和我同期入伍的同志不服气。万万没有想到，就在组织上宣布我担任连长的那天晚上，我发现笔记本里有一张纸条，上面写了这样几句话：“职务的提升，是革命的需要。为革命你要更加积极负责，毛泽东思想伟大红旗要举得更高。车要开稳，方向掌正。勤检查机件毛病，保持马达正常，……”下面的署名是“你的战士”。
    这张纸条，我一口气看了几遍，越看越激动，心好象要蹦出来了，躺在床上怎么也睡不着。这是多么真挚的阶级感情，多么好的革命战友啊！这不仅是一个战士对我的支持，而且是全连同志对我的关怀、鼓舞和鞭策！这件事使我得到很大的启发：这个连长并不是我一个人在当；从一定的意义上说，全连每一个同志都在当连长。问题就看自己能不能相信群众，依靠群众，充分发挥同志们的积极性和创造性。有战无不胜的毛泽东思想作指针，有广大群众的热情支持，自己水平低又怕什么？！想到这里，我的顾虑和担心一扫而光。我把这段话抄到笔记本上，记在脑子里，经常看一看，想一想，作为鞭策自己不断前进的力量。
    回想我这几年的工作，凡是自己比较自觉地紧跟上头，紧靠下头，按照毛主席的教导，有事和群众商量的时候，事情就办得好一些，任务就完成得顺利一些。去年春天，战士们提出，要把连队的驻地布置成毛泽东思想的大课堂。当时，我思想上冒出了一个“难”字：我们连队三天两头转移，毛主席像和毛主席语录、标语又没有那么多，怎么布置呢？我和战士们一商量，结果，三班的同志连夜突击，一齐动手，把报纸上登的毛主席照片和语录收集起来，剪剪贴贴，很快地就把连队驻地布置得红彤彤的。
    报纸上开始对中国赫鲁晓夫开展大批判以后，同志们都迫切地要求投入这一场严肃的战斗。但是，上级还没有布置，指导员又不在家，自己从来没搞过，干着急没办法。后来，我开了个座谈会，向战士请教。会上，你一言，我一语，办法很快就出来了。同志们要写大字报，连里没有纸，战士就搬来一些废道木，五根并在一块，用石灰水刷写大标语和大字报，向中国赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火。就这样，大批判运动在我们连里很快地开展起来。
    这样的事例太多了，几天也说不完。在和同志们共同战斗的过程中，我对毛主席教导的：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”，有了更深刻的体会，千难万难，依靠群众就不难。
    在我担任干部工作的几年里，不仅在工作上得到战士们的大力支持和热情帮助，而且不断从战士们身上吸取了丰富的思想营养，受到了深刻的教育。在我刚当副连长的时候，有一次收了工，我带着部队往回走。忽然脑子里闪过一个念头：我现在是连的干部了，穿一身滚满泥巴的衣服在街上走，多不好意思！这种不健康的思想一露头，马上就在行动上表现出来。下午干活，和战士们一起抬泥巴抹屋顶，就躲躲闪闪，生怕泥巴沾到身上。同志们看出了我的心思，开玩笑说：“小心点，别把泥巴弄到副连长身上！”话只一句，却触到了我的疼处。我带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作，用“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷”这条语录来对照检查，我认识到：怕沾上泥巴，正是自己思想上有了“泥巴”。随着职务的提升，自己的资产阶级思想开始抬头了，“官气”滋长了。这是一个危险的苗头。现在怕沾泥巴，将来就会脱离劳动，脱离群众，发展下去，就可能堕入修正主义的泥坑。我深深感激同志们对我的关怀和帮助。我下定决心：一定要用实际行动冲掉思想上的“泥巴”，决不辜负党和同志们的期望。从那以后，我就长期住到班里，象过去当战士的时候一样和同志们一起生活，一起劳动。战士干什么活，我也干什么活；越是脏活、重活、危险活，越是抢着干、多干。时间长了，听到同志们赞扬我：“连长除了腰带和我们不一样，别的都一样。我们身上有多少泥巴，连长身上也有多少泥巴。没变！”我觉得：这是群众对我的最大的鼓励，也是我应该继续努力的奋斗目标。多滚一身泥巴，自己思想上的“泥巴”就少一层；多滚一身泥巴，和战士们的阶级感情就加深一分；永远和群众一起滚泥巴，就能够永远保持无产阶级革命战士的本色，在头脑里筑起一道防修反修的长城。
    我对待群众的批评和帮助，并不是都能很好地接受的。群众提出的好建议、好办法，比较容易听得进；群众提出的批评和意见，特别是那些击中要害的尖锐的批评，就往往不容易想得通。有一次，团里批准我们连和其它几个单位拆破土房盖厕所。我在连里动员大家早点去，说去晚了就捞不到“油水”了。三班长任锁保同志对我这种说法提出了尖锐的批评，说我是小团体主义。当时，我对这个问题认识不足，没有很好地接受他的意见，彻底清算这种思想。年终总评的时候，我带着这个问题学习了毛主席的教导。毛主席指出：小团体主义是“只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义，同样地具有很大的销蚀作用和离心作用。”毛主席的教导，帮助我揪出了头脑里的“私”字，使我认识到这个问题的严重性。在同志们帮助下，我又主动检查了其它几次类似的错误，对自己思想上的小团体主义倾向，来了一次大清算。
    伟大导师毛主席十分谦逊地说：“和全党同志共同一起向群众学习，继续当一个小学生，这就是我的志愿。”每次我学习这条语录，心里总是非常激动。能不能正确地对待群众，从根本上来说，是能不能贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的大问题，也是能不能接好毛泽东思想的班的大问题。我决心遵照毛主席的最新指示，“遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”永远让自己扎根在群众中间。在群众的监督和帮助下，沿着毛主席指引的方向继续前进！
    林副主席指示我们说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”从我自己成长的过程，我体会到，这是千真万确的真理。只有在自己的灵魂深处爆发革命，狠斗“私”字，才能够对革命事业发挥自己的一份力量，才能够真正把自己培养成无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    几年来，我深深地体会到，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，用毛泽东思想来改造自己，是长期的艰巨的任务，是一辈子的事，决不能一劳永逸。革命道路走不完，思想改造无止境。只有不满足于现状，不断地对自己一分为二，不断革自己的命，才能不断前进。思想上的敌人同一切反动派一样，都是欺软怕硬。要消灭它，必须打进攻战，必须同它坚决斗争。大斗，大提高；小斗，小提高；不斗，就只能当俘虏。
    无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命。革命越是向前发展，“公”字和“私”字的矛盾就越突出、越尖锐。只要思想稍一松懈，就有陷入“私”字泥坑的危险。我要坚决响应毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，决心学习一辈子毛泽东思想，用一辈子毛泽东思想，狠斗一辈子“私”字，在思想改造的战场上，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，做一个冲锋陷阵的无畏战士。（附图片）
