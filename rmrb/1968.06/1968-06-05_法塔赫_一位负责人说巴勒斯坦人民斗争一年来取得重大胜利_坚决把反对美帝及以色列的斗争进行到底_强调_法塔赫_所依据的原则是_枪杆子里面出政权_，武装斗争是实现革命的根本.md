A Fatah leader said in Damascus on the eve of the first anniversary of the U.S.-Israeli aggression against Arab countries that the Palestinian people's struggle has achieved major victories in the past year. He strongly condemned the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the Palestinian people and vowed to carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, to the end.

He said, "U.S. imperialism has been and is still trying its best to interfere and create the situation of Jewish occupation. U.S. imperialism has provided Israel with all the means to maintain Israel as the watchdog of U.S. interests in the Middle East. The U.S. uses Israel as a bridgehead to destroy the liberation forces actively operating in the Asian and African regions." He pointed out, "Israel is merely a base for imperialist aggression, a tool used by the United States and other imperialist countries to achieve their goals. No matter how far the United States goes in instigating and pushing Israel to carry out aggression, it cannot conquer the will of the Palestinian people to achieve final victory."

He emphasized, "Our struggle in Palestine is a part of the worldwide struggle for liberation against world imperialism led by the United States. We firmly support the peoples of all countries who demand freedom and independence. We support all revolutionary struggles against imperialism and for liberation in the world."

The leader, in reviewing Fatah's political achievements over the past year, said that the Palestinian people's struggle has shattered the myth of enemy superiority, eliminated various negative emotions after last year's U.S.-Israeli aggression, strengthened the unity of the people, and sustained and expanded the revolutionary struggle. He then stressed, "This is because we believe in what Chairman Mao pointed out: 'Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor; it is people, not things, that are decisive.'"

He said, "The military organizations under Fatah, the 'Storm' commando units, have also achieved major victories in the military field over the past year, killing 32 Israeli officers, killing and wounding nearly 3,000 invading troops, shooting down seven helicopters, and destroying and damaging 134 tanks and half-tracked military vehicles and 114 other types of vehicles."

The leader said, "We are fighting for a just cause. The justice of our cause determines that we must wage armed struggle." He pointed out, "The principle that Fatah adheres to is: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' Armed struggle is the fundamental way to realize the revolution." Armed struggle is the only way for the Palestinian people to liberate all their occupied lands from the hands of the Zionists.

He said, "We must strengthen the relationship between the masses and the guerrillas. We believe in this law: 'The people are to the guerrillas as water is to fish.' If the guerrillas leave the people, they cannot achieve their goals." He also said that it is necessary to unite all the forces of the masses, organize the masses, help them raise their consciousness, train them, and arm them.

He said, "We have gained the trust of some Arab countries and their support for our struggle, and the trust of all Arab peoples. We have also gained the support of many friendly countries, especially the People's Republic of China."

He wished the Chinese people further victories in their struggle against imperialism and all reactionaries under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, and wished the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China even greater victories.

    “法塔赫”一位负责人说巴勒斯坦人民斗争一年来取得重大胜利
     坚决把反对美帝及以色列的斗争进行到底
     强调“法塔赫”所依据的原则是“枪杆子里面出政权”，武装斗争是实现革命的根本
    新华社大马士革三日电　“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦解放运动）一位负责人在美以对阿拉伯国家发动侵略战争一周年前夕，在这里对新华社记者发表谈话，强烈谴责美帝国主义对巴勒斯坦人民犯下的滔天罪行，并表示一定要把反对美帝及其侵略工具以色列的斗争进行到底。
    他说，美帝国主义过去和现在一直在竭力插手制造犹太复国主义者占领的状态。美帝国主义向以色列提供了用来保持以色列作为维护美帝在中东利益的看家狗的一切手段，美帝把以色列作为通往亚非的桥梁来破坏亚非地区积极开展活动的解放力量。他指出，以色列“只不过是帝国主义进行侵略的基地，是美国和其它帝国主义国家用来实现它们的目的的工具而已。不管美国在怂恿和推动以色列进行侵略方面走得多远，它决不能征服巴勒斯坦人民决心取得最后胜利的意志。”
    他强调说：“我们巴勒斯坦的斗争，是反对以美国为首的世界帝国主义的全世界解放斗争的一个组成部分。”“我们坚决支持要求自由和独立的各国人民。我们支持世界上一切反对帝国主义和争取解放的革命。”
    这位负责人在回顾“法塔赫”一年来在政治方面所取得的成就时说，巴勒斯坦人民的斗争粉碎了敌人优势的神话，消除了去年美以侵略战争以后的各种消极情绪，加强了人民的团结，使革命斗争坚持下去并且日益扩大。他接着强调指出：“那是因为我们相信毛主席所指出的：‘武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。’”
    他说，“法塔赫”所属军事组织“暴风”突击队一年来在军事方面也取得了重大的胜利，共打死以色列军官三十二名，打死打伤侵略军近三千名，击落直升飞机七架，击毁和击伤坦克和半履带式军车一百三十四辆和其他各种车辆一百十四辆。
    这位负责人说：“我们是为正义的事业而战的。”“我们的事业的正义性注定我们要进行武装斗争。”他指出，“法塔赫”所依据的原则是：“‘枪杆子里面出政权’。武装斗争是实现革命的根本。”武装斗争是使巴勒斯坦人民从犹太复国主义者手里解放他们的全部被侵占的土地的唯一道路。
    他说：“我们要加强群众和游击队的关系。”“我们相信这条法则：‘人民之对于游击队犹如水之对于鱼。’如果游击队离开了人民，就不能达到目的。”他还说，需要团结一切群众的力量，把群众组织起来，帮助他们提高觉悟，使他们受到训练并武装起来。
    他说：“我们得到了一些阿拉伯国家的信任和他们对我们斗争的支持，得到了全体阿拉伯人民的信任。我们还得到了许多友好国家，特别是中华人民共和国的支持。”
    他祝愿中国人民在毛泽东主席的领导下在反对帝国主义和一切反动派的斗争中取得进一步的胜利，祝愿中国无产阶级文化大革命取得更大的胜利。
