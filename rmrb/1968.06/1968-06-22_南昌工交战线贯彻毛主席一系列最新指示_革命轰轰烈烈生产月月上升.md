The industrial and transportation front in Nanchang is vigorously implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The revolution is booming, and production is rising month by month.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, June 21—The broad revolutionary workers on the industrial and transportation front in Nanchang, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, are fiercely waging class struggle, accurately and decisively striking down a handful of class enemies, and greatly developing the excellent situation of revolution and production. Currently, the entire industrial and transportation front in the city is booming with revolution, and production is rising month by month. The city's total industrial output, which increased significantly in April compared to March, rose by another 10% in May. Labor productivity has generally improved, and a batch of new technologies have been successfully tested, along with a batch of new products. Since entering June, the production situation has been even better, with many factory workshops and teams completing their first-half-year production tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding them.

The great leader Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution launched by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses it leads and the reactionary Kuomintang. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Under the guidance of this latest instruction from Chairman Mao, the broad revolutionary workers on the industrial and transportation front in Nanchang have launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, greatly raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and powerfully promoting the development of production. Members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Jiangxi Tractor Manufacturing Plant have gone deep into workshops and teams, mobilizing the masses to seriously study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fiercely wage class struggle, and root out a handful of class enemies who have been secretly sabotaging the revolution and production. The revolution and production in the entire plant have rapidly taken on a new look. The plant's production increased significantly in April, and in May, it increased by more than 17% compared to April. The revolutionary workers in the machine repair workshop of the Nanchang Gear Factory have smashed the sabotage plots of a handful of class enemies, turning around the long-standing situation of not being able to complete tasks in April, and in May, they completed the production plan ahead of schedule by three days.

In conjunction with the new situation and tasks of the current class struggle, the revolutionary workers on the industrial and transportation front in Nanchang have persistently and deeply carried out the great criticism, further purging the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents, greatly promoting the thought revolutionization of the people, and powerfully promoting the development of production. The broad revolutionary workers of the Nanchang Rubber Factory have carried out the great criticism in depth and persistently in teams, with everyone taking the lead in the great criticism and being a pioneer in production. The factory's total production value in May increased by 25% compared to April.

    结合当前阶级斗争的新形势和新任务，南昌工交战线革命职工持久深入地开展革命大批判，进一步肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所散布的反革命修正主义谬论的流毒，大大促进了人的思想革命化，有力地推动了生产的发展。南昌橡胶厂广大革命职工以班组为单位深入持久地开展革命大批判，人人在革命大批判中打先锋，在生产上当闯将，全厂五月份生产总值比四月份增长百分之二十五。
