The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the Lanzhou Military Region and 180,000 revolutionary people of Lanzhou City recently held a grand rally to celebrate the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao's personal approval, and the order issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to posthumously award Comrade Men Hesheng the honorable title of "A Good Cadre Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line." The broad masses of soldiers and civilians expressed their determination to learn from Comrade Men Hesheng, to be loyal to the people, to the Party, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to take the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and the defense of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as their sacred duty.

The Lanzhou Military Region and the Lanzhou area are currently vigorously carrying out activities to propagate and learn from Comrade Men Hesheng. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's great call, and are eagerly studying Comrade Men Hesheng's lofty communist morals and heroic deeds. The soldiers and revolutionary masses attending the meeting, inspired by Comrade Men Hesheng's revolutionary spirit, are full of vigor and fighting spirit, repeatedly shouting, "Learn from Comrade Men Hesheng!" "Salute to Comrade Men Hesheng!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long, long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

Attending the meeting were Commander Zhang Da Zhi of the Lanzhou Military Region, Political Commissar and Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Gansu Province Jian Heng Han, and other leading comrades, as well as representatives of mass organizations and representatives from the unit where Comrade Men Hesheng served.

Comrade Zhang Da Zhi spoke at the meeting. He said, the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approved the posthumous award of the honorable title to Comrade Men Hesheng, which is a major event in our army's political life. Comrade Men Hesheng is indeed a prominent representative of cadres who are loyal to the people, to Chairman Mao, and to the Party's line. He is a good cadre of Chairman Mao who continues the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. To learn from Comrade Men Hesheng, we must learn from his noble qualities of being loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and follow Chairman Mao to make revolution forever. Learn from his thorough revolutionary spirit of consciously and resolutely executing and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and take the defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as a lifelong sacred duty.

Deputy Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee Hu Ji Zong spoke at the meeting. He said, to learn from Comrade Men Hesheng, we must truly do as he did, "think of Chairman Mao in everything, serve Chairman Mao in everything, follow Chairman Mao in everything, and do everything for Chairman Mao," and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. We must take Comrade Men Hesheng as an example, stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and with a thorough revolutionary spirit, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, actively launch a fierce attack on the class enemies, and bravely fight for the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution. Hu Ji Zong emphasized in his speech that Comrade Men Hesheng is "a good cadre loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line," a good example for the whole Party, the whole army, and the revolutionary people of the whole country to learn from, and also a good example for the members of the revolutionary committees at all levels and all cadres to learn from. In the process of learning from Comrade Men Hesheng, the members of the revolutionary committees at all levels must definitely put the revolutionization of the leading cadres in the first place, achieve results, and raise the ideological revolutionization of our ranks to a new level of being loyal to Chairman Mao, and build the newly born revolutionary committees at all levels into strong command posts that are prominent in proletarian politics, closely linked with the masses, full of revolutionary spirit, highly revolutionary, and highly combat-ready.

Representatives of the Third Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works in the Lanzhou Military Region, representatives of the Workers' Congress, Peasants' Congress, Red Guards' Congress of Colleges and Universities, and Red Guards' Congress of Middle Schools in the Lanzhou area successively spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed that they would definitely, like Comrade Men Hesheng, fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life and die for it. Remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Never forget class struggle," stand firmly on the front line of class struggle, launch a fierce attack on Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Gansu, completely criticize and expose them, and dig out all the traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries hiding in every corner. More widely carry out the "Support the Army, Love the People" activities, strengthen military-civilian unity, "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," and seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

The cities and regions under the jurisdiction of Hebei Province, where Comrade Men Hesheng's hometown is located, held meetings on the 29th to celebrate the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao's personal approval, and the order issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to posthumously award Comrade Men Hesheng the honorable title of "A Good Cadre Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line." The broad revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army decided to take Comrade Men Hesheng as an example, in the great storms of class struggle, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further raise their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, grasp class struggle, distinguish between the two different types of contradictions, and accurately and resolutely strike at a handful of class enemies, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

Shijiazhuang held a celebration rally attended by 500,000 military and civilian personnel, and the revolutionary masses of various counties in the Shijiazhuang area held meetings to listen to the broadcast of the rally. At the meeting, the broad revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, shouted thousands of times, "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long, long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

Leading comrades of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, including Li Xue Feng, as well as leading comrades of the Shijiazhuang garrison and the Revolutionary Committees of the Shijiazhuang area and Shijiazhuang City, attended the meeting. Deputy Chairman of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee and leading comrade of the People's Liberation Army Shijiazhuang garrison Zhang Ying Hui read the order of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to posthumously award Comrade Men Hesheng the honorable title of "A Good Cadre Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line." Deputy Chairman of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Liu Zi Hou spoke. Comrade Liu Zi Hou, on behalf of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, called on the revolutionary committees at all levels, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat throughout the province, and the broad revolutionary masses to firmly respond to Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's great call, seriously implement the order of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and immediately launch a massive and in-depth campaign throughout the province to propagate and learn from the Central order and the glorious deeds of Comrade Men Hesheng, so that the Central order and the glorious deeds of Comrade Men Hesheng are known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

Comrade Liu Zi Hou analyzed the new trends and characteristics of class struggle in Hebei Province in the current situation of good revolution and production, pointing out: the closer the Cultural Revolution is to comprehensive victory, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines becomes. At present, a handful of stubborn capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries are using more concealed and cunning two-faced methods to engage in sabotage and disruption, attempting to save their doomed fate. We must, on the basis of deeply carrying out the revolutionary criticism, step by step and in an organized manner, investigate class enemies. In carrying out this work, we must definitely conduct in-depth and detailed investigation and research, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, mobilize the masses, strictly distinguish between the two different types of contradictions, seriously learn and master Chairman Mao's series of policies on the struggle against enemies, rely on the proletarian revolutionary masses, the broad revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres, unite with all those who can be united, mobilize all positive factors, and isolate a handful of class enemies to the maximum extent, and accurately and resolutely strike at a handful of class enemies.

The relatives of Comrade Men Hesheng, leading comrades of the Shijiazhuang garrison, members of the Revolutionary Committees of the Shijiazhuang area and Shijiazhuang City, and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations successively spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed that they would, like Comrade Men Hesheng, be loyal to the people, to the Party, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

The military and civilian personnel of other regions in Hebei Province also held celebration rallies. (With pictures)
