The Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Micro-Motor Factory, which was recently established, held a production coordination meeting. Some comrades responsible for production in various workshops had arguments during the meeting, blaming each other and unwilling to take on tasks actively. The production coordination meeting turned into a bickering session, tasks were not implemented, and everyone left unhappily.

Facing this situation, the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee and the PLA comrades stationed in the factory to support the left together studied Chairman Mao's teachings repeatedly: "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles." They pointed out: The old factory's coordination meetings only "coordinated" things but not people, completely promoting the revisionist garbage of "production first" and "technology in command." Arguing and quarreling were common occurrences. We must eliminate the bad influences of the old coordination meetings and make the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought the foundation of our coordination meetings.

Soon, a new coordination meeting was held. This meeting was quite different from the previous ones. The comrade presiding over the meeting did not immediately ask everyone to discuss specific problems but spent three hours organizing everyone to study the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings and have a discussion. The meeting room echoed with the voices of comrades reading Chairman Mao's quotations. Chairman Mao's words stirred the hearts of all the attendees. Everyone, in the spirit of "each doing more self-criticism," seriously examined themselves and took on responsibilities actively.

After the meeting, comrades unanimously praised the coordination meeting for emphasizing proletarian politics and leading in thought, saying it was well conducted! Some said, "This is not a coordination meeting, but a very good meeting for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought!"

As soon as the coordination meeting ended, the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee and the PLA comrades stationed in the factory to support the left went deep into the grassroots and to the production frontlines to mobilize the masses. They studied the "Three Articles" with the workers, explained to everyone the important political significance of producing micro-motors, and mobilized the workers to actively respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," to grasp the revolution and promote production vigorously.

The workers' revolutionary enthusiasm was boosted. They not only worked hard to complete their own workshop's tasks but also actively sent people to support other workshops when they encountered difficulties. In the past, it was hard to mobilize them, but now they actively help each other, creating a lively scene of mutual cooperation throughout the factory. Spirit turns into material, and thought changes into production. The revolutionary and production situation of the entire factory is getting better and better.

Now, the coordination meetings of Beijing Micro-Motor Factory have all become "lecture meetings" on Mao Zedong Thought. At the beginning of each meeting, everyone spends most of the time studying Chairman Mao's works, sharing their insights, and criticizing and repudiating revisionism; only then do they discuss production issues. Some comrades said well: "We are the Revolutionary Committee, not the Production Committee. The Revolutionary Committee handles production by first handling the revolution; otherwise, it loses the foundation."

    北京微电机厂革委会，强调把活学活用毛泽东思想作为生产调度会的根本——
    抓生产首先抓突出无产阶级政治
    北京微电机厂革命委员会刚成立不久，开了一次生产调度会。有些车间负责生产的同志在会上发生了争执，彼此互相埋怨，不肯积极承担任务。生产调度会开成了扯皮会，任务不落实，大家不欢而散。
    针对这种情况，革委会的同志和驻厂支左的解放军同志一起，反复学习了毛主席的教导：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”大家指出：旧厂部的调度会是只“调”物不“调”人，搞的完全是“生产第一”、“技术挂帅”等一套修正主义黑货。扯皮、吵嘴，是家常便饭。我们一定要清除旧调度会的坏影响，把活学活用毛泽东思想作为调度会的根本。
    不久，新的调度会又召开了。这次会议和以前大不相同。主持会议的同志没有马上要大家摆具体问题，而是用了三个小时的时间，针对活思想，组织大家学习伟大领袖毛主席的教导，一起座谈讨论。会议室里一阵又一阵地传出朗读毛主席语录的声音。毛主席的话，字字句句激动着到会同志的心弦。大家本着“各自多做自我批评”的精神，人人认真检查自己，个个主动承担责任。
    会后，同志们异口同声称赞这次调度会突出无产阶级政治，思想领先，开得好！有的说：“这不是调度会，这是一次很好的活学活用毛泽东思想的讲用会！”
    调度会一结束，革委会的同志和驻厂支左的解放军同志又深入基层，到生产第一线去发动群众。他们和工人一起学习“老三篇”，向大家讲清楚生产微电机的重要政治意义，动员工人积极响应伟大领袖毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产。
    工人同志们的革命干劲鼓得足足的。他们不仅努力完成本车间的任务，别的车间有了困难，也主动抽人去支援。过去是调不动，现在是主动帮，全厂出现了互相协作的生动局面。精神变物质，思想变了，生产就跟着上升。全厂革命和生产的形势越来越好。
    现在，北京微电机厂的调度会都开成了毛泽东思想“讲用会”。每次会议开始，大家先用大部分时间学习毛主席著作，谈心得体会，斗私批修；最后，才研究生产问题。有的同志说得好：“我们是革命委员会，不是生产委员会。革委会抓生产，得首先抓革命，不然就丢掉了根本。”
