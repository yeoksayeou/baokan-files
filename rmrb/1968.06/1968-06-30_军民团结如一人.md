In our garrison, stories of "supporting the military and loving the people" are being told everywhere. We truly feel that: the real iron wall is the millions of people who genuinely support the revolution, it is the unity of the military and the civilians, and the red hearts that love our great leader Chairman Mao.

One summer night, suddenly the sky was lit up by flames, illuminating the dark night. The wind fanned the flames, making the fire burn even more fiercely. A nearby production brigade caught fire. At this moment, comrade Wang Shao Bin, who was in bed with an illness, saw the flames and jumped out of bed, waving his hand and shouting, "Comrades, follow me!" All the comrades immediately ran towards the fire. Thinking of what the poor and lower-middle peasants think, and what they are urgent about, and helping the poor and lower-middle peasants, inspired everyone. The comrades ran faster and faster, regardless of the winding and uneven paths, or the darkness and slippery roads. They fell and got up again to run. Sweat soaked their clothes, but everyone saw that comrade Wang Shao Bin, who was suffering from severe stomach problems, was running in the front, and they forgot their fatigue. Twenty miles were quickly covered. Every comrade fearlessly rushed in and out of the raging flames, saving the poor and lower-middle peasants' property time and time again. The clerk Yang Mian Xin's foot was burned, and comrades advised him to rest, but he refused and said, "Comrade Mai Xian De fought continuously for three hours despite his severe injuries. This little injury of mine is nothing." After saying this, he rushed back into the fire. After a fierce battle, the fire was extinguished. We then organized the affected villagers to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades should see achievements and see the light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." To further strengthen the villagers' confidence in overcoming difficulties, the comrades donated their shining books and also gave their long-saved allowances and some clothes to the poor and lower-middle peasants. The comrades said, "We are giving the most precious and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the boundless loyalty of the soldiers to Chairman Mao, and the deep class feelings of the people's army with the poor and lower-middle peasants."

We did what we should do according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and the people gave us great honor and support, making our garrison a place where "the military and civilians are united as one, and let's see who can defeat us."

In August 1967, it had been 150 days without rain. Looking down at the mountains, the once great river had become a winding mountain road. The water supply for the troops was reduced from half a basin to a cup of tea. Soon, the water for the machine room would be used up. To ensure that the preparations for war were not affected, the comrades gave up all their rest time, searching everywhere for water sources. For a bucket of water, even if it was eight or ten miles away, they would go to fetch it. The news of the soldiers' water shortage quickly spread among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. They said, "The PLA, to protect us poor and lower-middle peasants, fights day and night on the high mountains. Whenever we are in the most difficult times, they appear before us. Now they are having trouble with water, their difficulties are our difficulties, we must find a way to help solve them." They carried water under the scorching sun from all directions, delivering one load after another. For a load of water, they stayed up all night, carrying lanterns through the mountain gorges, collecting water drop by drop from rock crevices and delivering it to us; for a load of water, they jumped into the wells, scooping out the yellow mud soup, letting it settle and clear, and delivering it to us; for a load of water, they got up at dawn and slept at midnight, crossing mountains and valleys, carrying water from twenty miles away and delivering it to us. What was particularly moving was that even the little Red Guards, about ten years old, came with small buckets to deliver water, and even grandmothers in their sixties carried water from more than ten miles away. An old man with white hair not only came to deliver water but also brought the warm greetings of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to the soldiers. Water, extraordinary water, the soldiers held the clear water, tears welling up in their eyes. Water, this is not ordinary water, it shows the deep affection of the poor and lower-middle peasants for the people's army, which was personally created by our great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. This is the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants offering their sincere red hearts to our great leader Chairman Mao.

    军民团结如一人
    东海舰队某部雷达站
    在我们驻地，到处传颂着“拥军爱民”的动人故事。我们真正体会到：真正的铜墙铁壁，是千百万真心实意拥护革命的群众，是军民团结，对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的红心。
    一个盛夏的夜晚，忽然火光冲天，把漆黑的夜空照得通亮。风助火势，越烧越旺。附近生产队失火了。这时正卧床生病的王绍斌同志，看见火光，从床上一跃而起，挥手喊道：“同志们，跟我来！”全体同志立即向失火地点跑去。想贫下中农之所想，急贫下中农之所急，帮贫下中农的心情，激励着大家，同志们越跑越快，不管羊肠小道崎岖不平，也不管天黑路又滑，同志们跌倒了爬起来再跑。汗水湿透了衣服，但大家看到患着严重胃病的王绍斌同志跑在前头，就忘记了劳累，二十里路很快就赶到了。每个同志都奋不顾身地出入在熊熊烈火之中，一次又一次地抢救出贫下中农的财产。文书杨绵新同志的脚被烧伤了，同志们劝他休息，他坚决不肯，并说：“麦贤得同志在伤势严重的情况下，连续战斗了三小时，我这么点伤算不了什么。”说完又冲入火海。经过英勇奋战，一场大火被扑灭了。我们又组织受灾群众共同学习毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”为了进一步增强社员克服困难的信心，同志们又献出金光闪闪的宝书，并拿出常年节约下来的津贴费以及部分衣服，送给了贫下中农。同志们说：“我们送的是世界上最珍贵的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是战士热爱毛主席的无限忠心，是人民军队同贫下中农深厚的阶级感情。”
    我们按照毛主席的教导，做了我们应该做的事，而人民群众却给了我们极大的荣誉和支援，使我们驻地出现了“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌”的局面。
    一九六七年八月，已有一百五十天没有下雨了，俯视山下，昔日的大河，如今却成了逶迤曲折的环山公路。部队的生活用水由原来的半脸盆减到一茶缸，眼看机房的用水就要用完了，为了不影响战备，同志们放弃了一切休息时间，四处寻找水源，为了一桶水，那怕是八里、十里，也要跑去挑。子弟兵缺水的消息，很快地在广大贫下中农中传开了，他们说：“解放军为了保卫我们贫下中农，日日夜夜战斗在高山，每当我们最困难的时刻，总是出现在我们面前。现在他们吃水很困难，他们的困难就是我们的困难，我们一定要想法帮助解决。”他们头顶烈日，从四面八方送来一担又一担的清水。为了一担水，他们彻夜不眠，提灯跑遍山沟，从岩石缝里把水一滴一滴积存起来，送给我们；为了一担水，他们跳到井里一瓢一瓢将黄泥汤掏起，沉淀澄清，送给我们；为了一担水，他们起五更睡半夜，翻山越岭，从二十里以外的地方挑来送给我们。特别令人感动的是，连十多岁的红小兵，也手提小桶前来送水，还有六十多岁的老妈妈也从十多里以外的地方，抬水上山。白发苍苍的老大爷不仅赶来送水，还带来了广大贫下中农对子弟兵的亲切问候。水，不平凡的水，子弟兵手提清水，热泪盈眶。水，这不是一般的水，它表现了贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造、林副主席直接指挥的人民军队无限热爱的深情厚意。这是广大贫下中农对我们伟大领袖毛主席献出的一片赤诚的红心。
