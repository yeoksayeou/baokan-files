	The Masses Are the Real Heroes
	People's Liberation Army propaganda team in Tianjin Hongqiao District, Zhang YuZhi

	At a time when the entire nation, both military and civilian, is advancing with high spirits under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I have repeatedly studied the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "The people, only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history." "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous, not understanding this point means one cannot gain even the most basic knowledge." By combining a year and a half of leftist support work with practice, I have deeply realized that firmly believing in, relying on, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit is the key to executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	I was sent to a factory in Tianjin Hongqiao District to carry out leftist support work in March of last year. When I first arrived, the masses showed us great trust and eagerly hoped that we would achieve results in our leftist support work. They sought our opinions on everything and we heard praise every day. In such a situation, due to my incomplete ideological transformation, I developed many wrong thoughts. For example, I thought that since Chairman Mao sent us to support the left, it meant that we were stronger than the left. Otherwise, why would we be sent to support the left instead of the left supporting us? The left is red, and we wear red armbands and red caps, which makes us even redder. Those who have rebelled for a year become leftists, and I, who have been in the revolution for eighteen or nineteen years, am an even more prominent leftist, and so on. With these wrong thoughts, I often educated the masses more than I humbly learned from them. When discussing problems with the masses, I used more affirmative language and less consultative language. In front of the masses, I appeared very arrogant. For instance, once when I was giving a lecture, I said, "The PLA, from top to bottom, can all recite the 'Three Articles.' If anyone doesn't believe it, come up and compare." Another time, a worker said at a meeting, "Welcome to the speech of Comrade Old Zhang, a good soldier of Chairman Mao." At that time, I felt that the words were not quite right, but I did not express my opinion and just accepted it. Later, at a meeting to solicit opinions, a worker comrade pointed out the problem to me in a straightforward manner, saying, "Old Zhang, you are too self-important. It seems that your worldview transformation is still far from complete." This criticism struck me to the core and made me realize my mistakes for the first time.

	In August of last year, our propaganda team, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, mediated talks between the two factions in the Woodworking Factory, eliminated differences, and prepared for a great alliance. At this time, the ultra-leftist trend in society spread to the Woodworking Factory. Some people said that the great alliance in the Woodworking Factory was a great compromise, a bourgeois reactionary line, a compromise, and a muddling through. In the factory and on the streets, many big-character posters were pasted on me. At this time, I had the thought of fearing risks, and I felt helpless about the great alliance issue. At this time, many revolutionary masses came to the door and said, "The revolutionary great alliance is Chairman Mao's strategic deployment. This path we have decided to take. Whoever comes to sabotage, we will fight to the death." Some workers said, "Old Zhang, just say it clearly, do you support our revolutionary great alliance? You are so afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind, is it because of selfishness?"

	The spirit of the broad revolutionary masses, who closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and are determined to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, deeply educated me. Chairman Mao teaches us, "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we can accomplish nothing." The revolutionary great alliance is the call of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee. We should firmly follow and firmly carry it out. At that time, I thought that it was not enough for us to just express support. We must also turn the revolutionary great alliance into the determination and conscious action of the broad masses. Therefore, we mobilized the masses to hold a big discussion. The discussion meeting turned into a rally for the revolutionary great alliance. Everyone unanimously expressed that Chairman Mao's instructions must be firmly carried out without hesitation. No matter how great the risk, we dare to bear it; no matter how great the interference, we can eliminate it. Even if a twelve-level typhoon blows outside, we will stand firm. In this way, the broad masses of the Woodworking Factory quickly achieved the revolutionary great alliance.

	Over the past year and a half, through similar incidents such as the great alliance in the Woodworking Factory, I have come to realize that the revolutionary masses understand Mao Zedong Thought the deepest, have the strongest political sensitivity, and always follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, standing at the forefront of the revolutionary movement. This is exactly what Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes."

### 群众是真正的英雄

    群众是真正的英雄
    中国人民解放军某部驻天津红桥区毛泽东思想宣传队　张玉芝
    正当全国军民，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我反复学习了伟大领袖毛主席的教导“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”结合一年多来的支左工作的实践，使我深刻地认识到：坚定不移地相信群众、依靠群众、尊重群众的首创精神，才能很好地执行毛主席的革命路线。
    我是去年三月份进入天津市红桥区工厂执行支左任务的。刚进厂时，广大群众给予我们极大的信任，热情地期望我们在支左工作中做出成绩来，事事都来征求我们的意见，天天听到的是一片赞扬声。在这种情况下，由于我思想没改造好，头脑里就产生了很多错误想法。例如，我认为毛主席派我们来支左，说明我们比左派还强，不然为什么要我们来支持左派，而不是要左派来支持我们呢？左派红，我们戴的是红领章，红帽徽，更是红上加红；造一年反的就成了左派，我革命十八九年更是响当当的左派了，等等。有了这些错误想法，我和群众接触中，常常是教育群众多，虚心向群众学习少。和群众研究问题，肯定的口气多，商量的口气少。在群众面前，显得非常骄傲。如有一次我讲课时说：“解放军从上到下都能背诵‘老三篇’，如果谁不服就上台来比比看。”还有一次一个群众在会上说：“欢迎毛主席的好战士解放军老张同志讲话。”当时我觉得这话不大对头，但也没有提出意见，就默认了。后来在征求意见的座谈会上，一个工人同志对这个问题一针见血地给我提出了批评，他说：“你老张太不自量了，看来你的世界观改造还差得远。”这次批评触及了我的灵魂，使我第一次受到了震动。
    去年八月份，我们宣传队在工农兵木器厂，用毛泽东思想指导两派恳谈，消除了分歧，准备实行大联合。就在这时，社会上的极“左”思潮波及到了木器厂。有些人说木器厂的大联合是大捏合，是搞资产阶级反动路线，是折衷、和稀泥。在工厂里、马路上给我贴了好多大字报。这时我头脑里产生了怕担风险的想法，对于大联合的问题，感到束手无策了。就在这时，许多革命群众找上门来说，革命大联合是毛主席的战略部署，这条路子我们是走定了，谁要来破坏，我们豁出这条命来也要跟他拚了。有的工人说：“老张，你明白说吧，你支持不支持我们搞革命的大联合？你这样前怕狼后怕虎，是私字在作怪吧？”
    广大革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的精神深深教育了我。毛主席教导我们说：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”革命大联合是毛主席、党中央的号召，我们应当坚决紧跟，坚决照办。当时我想，光我们表示支持还不够，还必须把革命大联合变为广大群众的决心和自觉行动。于是，我们发动群众进行了一次大讨论。讨论会变成了革命大联合的誓师大会，大家一致表示，毛主席的指示只能坚决照办，不能犹豫迟疑。风险再大，我们也敢承担；干扰再大，我们也能排除，就是外面刮起十二级台风也要顶住。就这样，木器厂广大群众终于很快地实现了革命大联合。
    一年多来，通过类似木器厂大联合问题等一件又一件事情的教育，使我认识到，革命群众对毛泽东思想理解得最深，政治敏感性最强，他们始终沿着毛主席指引的方向，站在革命运动的最前头。这正是毛主席所教导我们的：“群众是真正的英雄”。
