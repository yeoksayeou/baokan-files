The people's armed forces and civilians in the Saigon and surrounding areas, as well as the people's armed forces and civilians in the Quang Nam-Da Nang region, achieved the brilliant results of annihilating over 35,000 enemy troops in May, including more than 16,000 U.S. invaders.

The report said that since the night of May 4, the People's Liberation Armed Forces have continuously attacked a series of important targets of the enemy in the Saigon-Cholon area. The enemy's fifteen reserve battalions, thousands of police, and U.S. troops in Saigon were attacked from all directions. The civilians in the surrounding areas of Saigon simultaneously launched attacks on the enemy's various infantry division bases and fiercely struck at the enemy forces attempting to relieve Saigon.

According to incomplete statistics, the people's armed forces and civilians in Saigon and its surrounding areas killed and wounded more than 25,000 enemy troops in May, including nearly 11,000 U.S. invaders and Australian mercenaries, annihilated and severely damaged five U.S. battalions and ten puppet battalions; annihilated 1,000 puppet police. The People's Liberation Armed Forces also destroyed and damaged 1,020 enemy vehicles, including nearly 820 tanks and armored vehicles; shot down and destroyed more than 300 enemy aircraft; sank and damaged 12 warships; destroyed and forced the enemy to withdraw from 112 outposts and sentry posts.

The people's armed forces and civilians in the Quang Nam-Da Nang region continuously attacked the enemy in May, killing, wounding, and capturing 10,311 enemy troops, including 5,271 U.S. invaders and 379 South Korean mercenaries, annihilating a U.S. armored battalion and 17 companies of U.S. puppet troops, severely damaging five battalions and twelve companies of the enemy. The People's Liberation Armed Forces shot down and destroyed 159 enemy aircraft (excluding aircraft destroyed in the attack on the Chu Lai airfield), destroyed 294 military vehicles, 25 cannons, and thousands of other weapons, burned down nine fuel and ammunition depots, and seized dozens of military vehicles and a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

The report said that during this period, the people's armed forces and civilians in the Quang Nam-Da Nang region attacked the enemy's strongholds in the cities of Da Nang, Hue, Tam Ky, and many other cities, annihilated a large number of enemy troops, and severely damaged the main enemy forces, including the U.S. First Marine Division, the 11th Infantry Brigade, the 196th Infantry Brigade, and the 198th Infantry Brigade.

The people's armed forces and civilians in this region, while attacking the enemy, also destroyed eight "strategic hamlets" and nine "resettlement zones," forcing the enemy to withdraw from the Chinh De outpost and some outposts near Hue City. They also liberated many areas, including the complete liberation of Chinh De County.
