"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article titled "Follow the Thai Communist Party and Persist in Revolution Until Victory" on the 19th. The article pointed out: Through actual struggles, the Thai people have deeply felt that the Thai Communist Party, which persists in combining Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the Thai revolution, is the core force leading the Thai people in their brave struggle against American imperialism and its lackey, the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique, and in guiding the Thai people to achieve a thorough victory in the revolution.

The article said, the Thai Communist Party combines Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the Thai revolution, pointing out to the people who are friends and who are enemies, clarifying the tasks of each stage of the revolution, and bravely leading the Thai people in an unyielding struggle for Thailand's complete independence, for the people's democratic rights, and for a peaceful and prosperous life. Under the correct leadership of the Thai Communist Party, the Thai people's revolutionary struggle is advancing with great momentum. Revolutionary forces are growing stronger, the people's armed forces are becoming more powerful with each battle, and the flames of revolutionary armed struggle are rapidly spreading across the country. The Thai revolution presents a thriving and excellent situation.

The article said, in the proclamation issued on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the party, the Thai Communist Party once again clearly pointed out: "Our party is determined to lead the people in armed struggle, mobilize the peasant masses, establish rural base areas, persist in people's war, surround the cities from the countryside, and ultimately seize national power." The Thai people actively support and resolutely implement the Thai Communist Party's instructions.

The article said, the U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique is not reconciled to their failure. To extinguish the flames of the people's revolutionary struggle, they have adopted the mad tactics of armed suppression and political deception. However, all their struggles have failed. Because the Thai Communist Party leads the Thai people unwaveringly on the path of armed struggle and timely exposes all the enemy's political deception plots.

The article finally emphasized that the facts have proven that, relying on the correct leadership of the Thai Communist Party, which firmly adheres to Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries, the Thai people will definitely be able to defeat American imperialism and the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique.

    “泰国人民之声”欢呼革命武装斗争打出大好形势
    泰共是领导人民革命的核心力量
    坚持马列主义、毛泽东思想同泰国革命实践相结合坚持人民战争
    新华社二十一日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台十九日广播一篇题为《紧跟泰国共产党，坚持革命到胜利》的文章指出：泰国人民从实际斗争中深深地体会到，坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同泰国革命实践相结合的泰国共产党，是同美帝国主义及其仆从他侬—巴博卖国集团进行英勇斗争、带领泰国人民夺取革命的彻底胜利的核心力量。
    文章说，泰国共产党把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同泰国的革命实践相结合，向人民指出谁是朋友谁是敌人，指明各个阶段的革命任务，并且坚决勇敢地带领泰国人民为泰国的完全独立，为人民的民主权利和安居乐业进行不屈不挠的斗争。在泰国共产党的正确领导下，泰国人民的革命斗争正在高歌猛进。革命力量日益壮大，人民武装越战越强，革命武装斗争烈火迅速蔓延到全国各地，泰国革命呈现一片蓬勃的大好形势。
    文章说，泰国共产党在建党二十五周年发表的文告中已经再一次明确地指出：“我们党下定决心领导人民进行武装斗争，发动农民群众，建立农村根据地，坚持人民战争，以农村包围城市，最后夺取全国政权。”泰国人民积极拥护并且坚决贯彻执行泰国共产党的这一指示。
    文章说，美国—他侬反动集团决不甘心于它们的失败。为了扑灭人民的革命斗争的烈火，它们采取了疯狂的武装镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手。但是，它们的一切挣扎都失败了。因为泰国共产党领导泰国人民坚定不移地走武装斗争的道路，并且及时地揭露了敌人的一切政治欺骗阴谋。
    文章最后强调指出，事实证明，坚决依靠坚持毛泽东思想这一反对帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派的强大思想武器的泰国共产党的正确领导，泰国人民就一定能够战胜美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国集团。
