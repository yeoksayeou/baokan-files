Comrade Men He, in order to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and for the safety of the lives of 27 class brothers, sacrificed his precious life. He is indeed a "good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line," a good son of the people, and a model for us poor and lower-middle peasants to learn from. His heroic act of self-sacrifice to save others has given a resounding slap in the face to the propagandists of the philosophy of self-preservation, China's Khrushchev. We must learn from Comrade Men He and criticize the reactionary fallacies of "cherishing oneself" and "protecting one's own life and health" spread by China's Khrushchev, criticizing them until they are worse than dog shit.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To struggle is to sacrifice, and death is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, of the suffering of the majority of the people. To die for the people is to die a worthy death." Revolutionary soldiers win battles by being brave, by fearing no death, and by being loyal to Chairman Mao with a red heart. "Good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line" Men He is a prominent representative of the countless heroes in the People's Liberation Army. He "thinks of everything for Chairman Mao, obeys everything for Chairman Mao, follows everything for Chairman Mao, and does everything for Chairman Mao." To defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, he dares to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire. We poor and lower-middle peasants deeply understand: The countryside is a battlefield of class struggle between two classes, two roads, two lines, and two kinds of thoughts. There is class struggle everywhere, and often there are tests of life and death. To resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," we must have the high qualities and spirit of defending Chairman Mao to the death, as Comrade Men He does.

In February of this year, once when I was driving a cart to pull manure, because the main road was muddy, an accident happened. The horse slipped and fell into a manure pit more than a meter deep. Ice splashed high, and it seemed that the horse was in danger of freezing. I thought of Chairman Mao's teaching, "To struggle is to sacrifice," and I thought of the benefits that collectivization has brought to us, and of countless heroes. My whole body was filled with strength. I immediately jumped into the manure pit, quickly put on a rope, and with everyone else pulled the horse out.

China's Khrushchev desperately advocates the philosophy of self-preservation, "cherishing oneself" and "protecting one's own life and health." His evil intentions are to try to make us take care of ourselves, ignore the collective, and even sacrifice collective interests, in order to realize his plot to sabotage the socialist collective economy and make us suffer again. This is absolutely not allowed. Every blade of grass, every cow and horse in the production team are what countless revolutionary martyrs have exchanged with their blood for, and are what Chairman Mao has led us to create through hard struggle. We poor and lower-middle peasants will not let the collective interests suffer the slightest loss!

We must actively respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call to learn from Comrade Men He, take Comrade Men He as a shining example, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, launch a high tide of "grasp revolution, promote production," and strive for a bumper harvest this year.

    狠批活命哲学，维护集体利益
    北京市大兴县金星大队贫农社员　陈增权
    门合同志为了坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，为了二十七个阶级兄弟的生命安全，献出了自己的宝贵生命。他不愧是“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”，人民的好儿子，俺们贫下中农学习的好榜样。他舍己救人的英雄行为，给了活命哲学的吹鼓手中国赫鲁晓夫一记最响亮的耳光。俺们一定要向门合同志学习，把中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的“钟爱自己”、“保护自己的生命与健康”等反动谬论，批得比狗屎还臭。
    毛主席教导我们：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”革命战士打胜仗就是靠勇敢，靠不怕死，靠忠于毛主席的一颗红心。“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志是人民解放军千万个英雄人物当中的一个突出代表，他“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席”。为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，他刀山敢上，火海敢闯。俺们贫下中农深深懂得：农村存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线和两种思想的激烈斗争，处处有阶级斗争的战场，往往也有生和死的考验。要坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，就必须具有门合同志无限忠于毛主席的崇高品质和誓死保卫毛主席的革命精神。
    今年二月份，有一次俺驾车拉粪，因大路翻浆，发生意外情况，马失蹄掉进一人多深的大粪坑里，冰块溅起老高，眼看马有冻坏的危险，俺想到毛主席“要奋斗就会有牺牲”的教导，想到集体化给俺们带来的一切，想到无数英雄人物，浑身上下都充满了力量。我立即跳进粪坑，迅速穿好绳子，和大家一起把马拉了上来。
    中国赫鲁晓夫拚命鼓吹“钟爱自己”“保护自己的生命与健康”的活命哲学，其恶毒用心就是妄图要俺们自顾自，不管集体，甚至牺牲集体利益，好实现他搞垮社会主义集体经济的阴谋，让俺们重受二遍苦。这是绝对办不到的。生产队的一草一木，一牛一马，都是无数革命先烈用鲜血换来的，是毛主席他老人家领导俺们经过艰苦奋斗创造出来的，俺们贫下中农死也不能让集体利益受到半点损失！
    俺们一定积极响应毛主席和党中央发出的向门合同志学习的伟大号召，以门合同志为光辉榜样，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，掀起“抓革命，促生产”的高潮，争取今年农业丰收。
