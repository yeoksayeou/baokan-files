Recently, with boundless love, loyalty, faith, and adoration for our great leader Chairman Mao, and with deep hatred for China's Khrushchev, we held a criticism meeting. This meeting had a distinctive feature: while criticizing China's Khrushchev's "class struggle extinction" theory, we also linked it to criticizing various bizarre and strange theories about class struggle within our factory. This approach made the revolutionary criticism more lively and helped us thoroughly eliminate the poison of China's Khrushchev's "class struggle extinction" theory in our factory, further raising the awareness of all revolutionary workers. Everyone thought it was very good. Below is the summary of the speeches from this criticism meeting.

Is it true that because a factory is small and has few people, the situation is special and class struggle is not intense? The head of the factory revolutionary committee and the leader of the revolutionary mass organization, Tang Shenchuan, said: No!

There is no "utopia" in a class society

When I was demobilized from the army and assigned to this factory, I also had this thought: "Our factory is small, so there won't be many problems." However, over the past few years, especially in the past two years, the actual situation in our factory has given me a vivid lesson in class struggle. That small group of unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, along with reactionary capitalists, have been stirring up trouble, jumping around, and even infiltrating our "heart," launching one savage attack after another against the proletariat. Sharp, complex, and intense class struggle has never stopped. In our factory, there is a landlord's wife who insists on a reactionary stance. She not only infiltrated the Party but also seized the position of deputy chairman of the union and became a "red person" in the factory. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, she seized the position of head of the factory's Cultural Revolution materials group and labeled one-third of the workers in the entire factory as "anti-party cliques" and "counter-revolutionaries." During the great January Revolution storm, we struggled against this person. However, she did not give up and jumped around, running everywhere to "report" on the "situation" of the revolutionary cadres; recently, she has been active again, attempting to rehabilitate herself. This heart-pounding struggle tells us a great truth: "The enemy will not disappear on its own. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage on their own." It also shows that even small factories have sharp and intense class struggles, with nothing "special" about them. In a class society, there is no such thing as a "special" utopia.

China's Khrushchev vigorously advocates the "class struggle extinction" theory, attempting to tightly cover up the lid of class struggle and protect a small group of traitors, spies, stubborn capitalists, and unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. This is a big conspiracy! If we fall for China's Khrushchev's "class struggle extinction" theory and use the excuse of "special circumstances" to overlook the sharp and complex class struggle, we will fall into a passive position of being beaten and suffer defeats in the struggle against the enemy. In the future, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," always remembering class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and always standing on the front line of class struggle, actively, fiercely, and persistently attacking the class enemies! Attack! Attack again!

The more the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution approaches total victory, the more complex and profound the class struggle becomes. The leader of the revolutionary mass organization, Li Xiliang, said: We must—

Always pay attention to new trends in class struggle

China's Khrushchev repeatedly advocates that "now the domestic enemies have basically been eliminated" and "we have basically completed the socialist revolution," attempting to use the "class struggle extinction" theory to cover up his savage attacks on the proletariat! Currently, some people say nonsense like "the capitalist roaders are finished, the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists have been 'beaten' into 'dead tigers,'" and "class struggle has entered a 'low tide,'" and so on. If we do not criticize the "class struggle extinction" theory and allow this "low tide" theory to spread, it will numb our fighting spirit, stop our struggle against the enemy, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution unable to proceed smoothly to the end. We must not be fooled.

Currently, not only are there hidden class enemies in the revolutionary ranks that we must root out one by one, but even those who have been exposed as a small group of reactionaries, who appear to be "obedient" on the surface, still harbor deep hatred for the proletariat in their hearts. They are not "dead tigers" but poisonous snakes that are not yet dead; they are always watching for an opportunity to strike. In our factory, there is a reactionary capitalist who, in a previous period, used his position as the warehouse manager to arbitrarily violate regulations, use state property to curry favor, and spread poisonous sugar-coated bullets to corrupt young workers. He told a young worker: "You are young and talented, and you are also a veteran rebel. You can definitely be a commander. If you want to smoke, I have 'Big Front Gate' here; if you need any tools, just say the word, and I'll keep them for you before others get them." He attempted to use small favors to make this young worker his agent within the revolutionary ranks. Later, with the help of comrades, this young worker saw through his tricks and, together with the revolutionary cadres of the entire factory, struggled against this reactionary capitalist, suppressing his counter-revolutionary arrogance.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership of the broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest instructions have further pointed out the general direction of our current struggle. Although the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, to achieve total victory in the Cultural Revolution, we still have a lot of work to do and will experience intense and complex class struggles. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, and strike back at the class enemies' rightist reversal wind, steadfastly carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

After the revolutionary committee was established, can the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat sit back and enjoy the peace? The production group leader and old worker, Wang Changmei, said: Class struggle has not ended, and the struggle is still focused on the issue of "power." We must—

Resolutely defend the new revolutionary power

Our factory established the revolutionary committee last October. Over the past half year, the struggle for power and counter-struggle for power has never stopped. A small group of class enemies either spread rumors and set fires, attempting to incite revolutionary masses to deny the new revolutionary committee; or they collude with some people, attack others, attempting to create divisions within the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat; or they deceive the masses and sabotage production, putting pressure on the revolutionary committee from all sides; or they deliberately forge handwriting and write reactionary notes, attempting to frame members of the revolutionary committee. A group leader in our production group was elected as a member of the factory revolutionary committee, and some people with ulterior motives often came to sow discord between me and this committee member, saying things like: "Old Wang, you are an old Party member, stand up straight, don't be a slave!" They always try to sabotage the new revolutionary committee in every possible way to establish their counter-revolutionary dictatorship.

Facing such intense struggles for power and counter-struggles for power, at first, I could not see clearly, was afraid of making mistakes, and dared not struggle. The factory revolutionary committee promptly held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, deeply studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and the issue of power, and thoroughly exposed various manifestations of class struggle in the factory. This made me realize: Facing the savage attacks of class enemies on the red power of the proletariat, if I cannot see it and do not counterattack, isn't this a manifestation of right opportunism? Isn't this the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao? With my awareness raised, I actively and voluntarily joined the struggle against the enemy. Because we took the initiative to attack, we launched a fierce red storm against the class enemies, finally exposing a small group of class enemies, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, and greatly suppressing the arrogance of the class enemies, consolidating the new red power of the factory revolutionary committee.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power." Some people think: "After the revolutionary committee is established, the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat are in power, and they can sit back and enjoy the peace." This shows that the poison of China's Khrushchev's "class struggle extinction" theory has not been eliminated in the minds of some comrades. We must thoroughly criticize and expose the "class struggle extinction" theory, overcome right opportunism and complacency, and greatly enhance our awareness of class struggle, resolutely strike back at all counter-revolutionary restoration plots of the class enemies, and use our blood and lives to defend our red power!

We take the initiative to attack the class enemies, but some people say this is "creating factions" and "factional struggle." The liaison of the revolutionary mass organization, Xie Tianlin, firmly said: We must conduct a class analysis of factionalism, and for the sake of fighting against the class enemies, we must—

Firmly uphold the factionalism of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat

In our factory, there is a bad element from a rich peasant background who insists on a reactionary stance. He does not talk much on the surface and pretends to be "obedient," but in reality, he is extremely reactionary. We revolutionary cadres of the proletariat have gathered information about him from various aspects and, with the support of the factory revolutionary committee, have taken revolutionary actions against him. At this time, some people who were deceived by this reactionary's disguise thought that we were "creating factions." At first, we also had some concerns, fearing that we would be labeled with the hat of "factionalism," and our struggle against him was somewhat hesitant.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions on conducting a class analysis of factionalism have pointed out the direction for us. We must forever uphold the factionalism of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, that is, forever uphold the thorough revolutionary nature of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat! If we do not attack the class enemies who are clearly in front of us, that is tantamount to indulging the class enemies, which is the greatest disloyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao and the greatest disloyalty to the revolution! Through continuous battles, we exposed a large number of reactionary crimes of this bad element. It was this bad element who, in front of an apprentice girl he had corrupted, spoke a large amount of extremely reactionary words. Later, this apprentice girl, with the help of the factory revolutionary committee and the revolutionary masses, saw through the reactionary face of this bad element and firmly turned against him. This bad element harbored deep hatred for this apprentice girl and wrote anonymous letters to threaten her, determined to kill her! He harbored deep hatred for our revolutionary cadres' previous criticism and struggle against him and clearly wrote in his diary that he wanted to take revenge. All this strongly proves: Our struggle against these reactionaries is precisely what Chairman Mao pointed out, "is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership of the broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie."

Through this struggle, I have such a feeling: Using the slogan of "opposing factionalism" to oppose the revolutionary nature of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat is a new tactic used by the class enemies to attack us. But why do some of our comrades hesitate to struggle against the enemy when faced with the big hat of "factionalism"? Because there is still the poison of China's Khrushchev's "class struggle extinction" theory in our own minds, and we cannot see the class essence of factionalism. This is a manifestation of right opportunism and conservatism, and if it develops, it will lead to the danger of right opportunism and capitulationism. We must arm ourselves with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, constantly enhance our awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and forever stand on the front line of class struggle!

We exposed a large amount of material on class struggle, but some people think this is "making a mountain out of a molehill." The Communist Party member and revolutionary cadre, Liu Maoying, firmly said: No! This is not making a mountain out of a molehill, but making a big deal out of a big issue. We must—

Use the perspective of class struggle to analyze social phenomena

China's Khrushchev madly advocates the "class struggle extinction" theory, saying nonsense like "in the future, the main task of the state is to organize social life." What kind of "social life" does China's Khrushchev want to "organize"? It is the "social life" of spreading reactionary "Yanshan Black Speech," the "social life" of listening to Western music, and the "social life" of spreading the decadent and declining lifestyle of the bourgeoisie! In short, it is to use the cover of "life issues" to launch savage attacks on the proletariat! This is a tactic used by the bourgeoisie to attack the proletariat under socialist conditions.

A small group of unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists also use "life issues" as a tactic to attack the proletariat. In our factory, there is a family member of a four-category element who insists on a reactionary stance and uses extremely treacherous and despicable methods to corrupt revolutionary cadres, Party members, and worker masses in terms of life. However, when we criticize and struggle against this person, some people are surprised and say: "It's just a life issue, why make a mountain out of a molehill?" Is it just a life issue? Listen to what this bad element says! She gritted her teeth and said: "You made my husband go to jail, and I will make you chaotic!" Look, is this a "life issue"? No, this is a political issue! This is class struggle!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, some classes win, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of civilization over several thousand years." Class struggle is the root cause of all social phenomena. Without the perspective of class struggle, it is impossible to correctly understand and analyze various social phenomena. Why can't some of our comrades see through the false appearance of "life issues" and see the essence of class struggle? Because the poison of China's Khrushchev's "class struggle extinction" theory is still haunting their minds, so in the face of the complicated "life issues," they become deaf and blind, catch a political "cold," and lose the ability to distinguish in class struggle. If this continues, they will not even know how their heads were cut off. How dangerous this is! We must strive to arm ourselves with Chairman Mao's great learning of class struggle, carry out the revolutionary criticism to the end, carry out the great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions to the end, and sweep China's Khrushchev and a small group of capitalist roaders, along with their black goods like the "class struggle extinction" theory, into the garbage bin of history!

    彻底批判“阶级斗争熄灭”论　稳准狠地向阶级敌人进攻
    ——记上海绝缘测定器厂的一次革命大批判会
    上海绝缘测定器厂革命委员会政宣组按：最近，我们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰和无限崇拜的无产阶级感情，带着对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，召开了一次批判大会。这个大会有个特点，就是在批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论的同时，联系批判了我们厂里在阶级斗争问题上的种种奇谈怪论。这样做，把革命大批判搞活了，就能够更深地肃清中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论在我们厂里的流毒，进一步提高全厂革命职工的觉悟，大家觉得很好。下面，就是这个批判会的发言纪要。
    是不是厂小人少，情况就特殊，阶级斗争就不激烈？厂革委会负责人、革命群众组织负责人谈申川说：不！
    在阶级社会中没有“世外桃源”
    我从部队复员刚分配到这个厂的时候，也有这个想法：“我们这个厂小，问题不会很多。”可是几年来，特别是近两年来，我们厂现实情况，使我受到了活生生的阶级斗争教育。那一小撮没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子和反动资本家，兴风作浪，上窜下跳，甚至钻进我们的“心脏”，向无产阶级发动了一次又一次猖狂的进攻。尖锐、复杂和激烈的阶级斗争从来没有停止过。我们厂里有一个坚持反动立场的地主小老婆。她不仅混进了党内，而且窃取了工会副主席等职权，俨然成了厂里的“红人”。文化大革命初期，她又窃取了厂文革材料组长的职权，把全厂三分之一的群众打成了“反党集团”、“反革命”等。在伟大的一月革命风暴中，我们批斗了这个家伙。但是，她心不死，上窜下跳四出奔走，到处“告”无产阶级革命派的“状”；最近，还在猖狂活动，妄图为自己翻案。这场惊心动魄的斗争，告诉我们一个伟大的真理：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”同时也说明，小厂同样存在着尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争，没有什么“特殊”可言。在阶级社会中，不存在什么“特殊”的“世外桃源”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫大肆鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，就是妄想死死捂住阶级斗争盖子，保护一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。这是一个大阴谋！如果我们中了中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的毒，借口“情况特殊”，而看不到尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争，那就会陷于被动挨打的地位，在对敌斗争中吃败仗。今后，我一定要按照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，永远站在阶级斗争第一线，主动、猛烈而又持久地向阶级敌人进攻！进攻！再进攻！
    无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是复杂，越是深刻。革命群众组织负责人李锡良说：我们必须——
    时刻注意阶级斗争的新动向
    中国赫鲁晓夫一再鼓吹：“现在国内敌人已经基本上被消灭”，“我们基本上完成了社会主义革命”，妄图用“阶级斗争熄灭”论来掩护他向无产阶级的疯狂进攻！当前，有人胡说什么“走资派完蛋了，地富反坏右已经被‘打’成‘死老虎’了”，“阶级斗争已进入‘低潮’了”，等等。如果我们不批判“阶级斗争熄灭”论，让这种“低潮”论泛滥，就会麻痹我们的斗志，停止对敌人的斗争，使无产阶级文化大革命不能顺利进行到底。我们决不能上当。
    目前，不仅在革命队伍里还有隐藏着的阶级敌人，必须把他们一个不漏地挖出来；即使是已被揪出来的一小撮反动家伙，表面上装得很“老实”；心里却仍然充满着对无产阶级的刻骨仇恨。他们不是“死老虎”，而是僵而不死的毒蛇；无时无刻不在窥测方向，以求一逞。我们厂有个反动资本家，前一段时间，他利用担任仓库管理员的职权，随意破坏规章制度，用国家的东西做人情，大肆腐蚀青年工人，大放糖衣炮弹。他对一个青年说：“你年青有为，又是老造反，完全可以当司令。你要抽烟，我这里有‘大前门’；你要什么工具，只要你开声口，我别人不给，先给你留着。”妄图从小恩小惠入手，使这个青年成为他安插在革命队伍内的代理人。后来，在战友的帮助下，这个青年识破了他的阴谋诡计，同全厂的无产阶级革命派一道批斗了这个反动资本家，打下了他的反革命气焰。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的这一最新指示，为我们进一步指明了当前斗争的大方向。无产阶级文化大革命虽已取得了决定性的胜利，但是，要夺取文化大革命的全面胜利，还要做很多的工作，还要经历激烈的、复杂的阶级斗争。我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，迎头痛击阶级敌人的右倾翻案风，坚定不移地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    革命委员会成立后，无产阶级革命派就可以太太平平坐天下了吗？生产组长、老工人王长美说：阶级斗争并没有结束，斗争仍然集中在一个“权”字上。我们必须——坚决捍卫新生的革命政权
    我们厂是去年十月份成立革委会的。半年多来，夺权和反夺权的斗争一刻也没有停止过。一小撮阶级敌人，或者煽阴风，点鬼火，妄图煽动革命群众否定新生的革命委员会；或者拉拢一些人，打击一些人，妄图在无产阶级革命派队伍中制造分裂；或者蒙蔽群众，破坏生产，从各方面对革命委员会施加压力；或者有意伪造笔迹，书写反动纸条，妄图陷害革命委员会成员。我们生产小组的一个组长当选了厂革命委员会的委员，个别别有用心的人就常常跑来挑拨我同这个委员的关系，说什么：“老王啊，你是老党员了，腰杆要硬起来，不要奴隶主义呀！”他们对新生的革命委员会，总是千方百计地想搞垮它，以便建立他们的反革命专政。
    面对着这样激烈的夺权和反夺权斗争，开始，我还看不清楚，怕犯错误，不敢斗争。厂革委会及时举办了毛泽东思想学习班，大学毛主席关于阶级斗争和政权问题的论述，大摆厂里阶级斗争的种种表现，使我认识到：面对着阶级敌人对无产阶级红色政权的猖狂进攻，竟然看不见，不反击，这难道不正是思想右倾的表现吗？这难道不是对毛主席的最大不忠吗？认识提高了，我就积极主动地投入到对敌斗争中去。由于我们主动出击，向阶级敌人大刮十二级红色台风，终于揪出了一小撮阶级敌人，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，巩固了厂革委会这个新生的红色政权。
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”有些人认为：“革命委员会成立后，无产阶级革命派掌权了，就可以太太平平坐天下了”，这说明在我们一些同志的头脑里，中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的流毒还未肃清。我们一定要批倒批臭“阶级斗争熄灭”论，克服右倾麻痹思想，百倍增强阶级斗争观念，迎头痛击阶级敌人的一切复辟阴谋，用鲜血和生命来捍卫我们的红色政权！
    我们主动向阶级敌人进攻，有人却说这是“搞派性”，是“派性斗争”。革命群众组织联络员谢天麟坚决地说：“对派性必须进行阶级分析，为着同阶级敌人进行战斗，我们就是要——
    坚持无产阶级革命派的派性
    我们厂里有个富农出身的坚持反动立场的坏家伙，他表面上不大爱讲话，装得“老实”，实际上极其反动。我们无产阶级革命派从多方面掌握了他的情况，在厂革委会的支持下，对他采取了革命行动。这时，一些被这个反动家伙的伪装所迷惑的人，却认为我们这是在“搞派性”。开始，我们也有些顾虑，怕被人扣上“派性作怪”的帽子，对他的斗争有些缩手缩脚。
    毛主席对派性要进行阶级分析的最新指示给我们指明了前进的方向。我们就是要永远坚持无产阶级革命派的派性，即永远坚持无产阶级革命派的彻底革命性！如果对明摆着的阶级敌人不去进攻，那就是纵容了阶级敌人，那就是对伟大领袖毛主席的最大不忠，对革命的最大不忠！经过连续作战，我们把这个坏家伙的大量反动罪行揭了出来。正是这个家伙，曾在一个被他腐蚀的女艺徒面前，讲了大量内容极其反动的话。后来这个女艺徒在厂革委会和革命群众的帮助下，认清了这个坏家伙的反动面目，坚决反戈一击。这个坏家伙就对她恨之入骨，多次写匿名信恐吓她，必欲置她于死地而后快！他对我们革命派过去对他的批判斗争怀恨在心，在日记里清清楚楚地写下了他要进行反革命报复。这一切，有力地证明：我们同这些反动家伙的斗争，正是毛主席指出的“是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”
    通过这场斗争，使我有这样一个体会：用“反对派性”的口号来反对无产阶级革命派的革命性，这是当前阶级敌人向我们进攻的一种新手段。而为什么我们有些同志在“派性作怪”的大帽子面前，对敌斗争就缩手缩脚了呢？因为在我们自己的头脑里还有中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论的流毒，看不清派性的阶级实质。而这正是右倾保守思想的表现，发展下去，就有走向右倾投降的危险。我们一定要用毛主席的最新指示武装自己的头脑，不断增强自己的阶级斗争和路线斗争观念，永远站在阶级斗争的最前哨！
    我们揭出了大量阶级斗争的活材料，有人却认为这是“生活问题嘛，何必小题大做呢？”共产党员、革命干部刘茂英坚定地说：不！这不是小题大做，而是大题大做。我们必须——
    用阶级斗争观点分析社会现象
    中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂地宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，胡说什么“今后国家最主要的任务是组织社会生活。”中国赫鲁晓夫要“组织”什么样的“社会生活”？就是大讲反革命的“燕山黑话”的“社会生活”，大听西方音乐的“社会生活”，就是大肆散布腐朽、没落的资产阶级生活方式的“社会生活”！说穿了，就是要在“生活问题”外衣的掩护下，向无产阶级猖狂进攻！这是社会主义条件下，资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的一种手段。
    一小撮没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，也是利用“生活问题”作为向无产阶级进攻的一种手段的。我们厂有个坚持反动立场的四类分子家属，采取了极其阴险卑鄙的手法，从生活上大肆腐蚀革命干部、党员和工人群众。可是，当我们对这个家伙开展批判斗争时，一些人却大惊小怪地说：“生活问题嘛，何必小题大做呢！”仅仅是生活问题吗？且听这个坏家伙自己是怎么说的！她咬牙切齿地说：“你们弄得我丈夫坐牢，我也要弄得你们乱糟糟！”看，这难道是“生活问题”吗？不，这是政治问题！这是阶级斗争！
    毛主席教导我们说：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”阶级斗争是一切社会现象的总根源。离开了阶级斗争观点，就不可能正确理解和正确分析各种社会现象。为什么我们有些同志不能透过“生活问题”的假象，看到阶级斗争的实质呢？因为中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论还在他们头脑里作怪，所以在纷纭复杂的“生活问题”面前变得耳不聪、目不明，患了政治上的“重感冒”，在阶级斗争中丧失了辨别能力。这样下去，那就会连脑袋掉了还不知道是怎么掉的。这是多么危险啊！我们一定要努力用毛主席的阶级斗争的伟大学说来武装自己，把革命的大批判进行到底，把在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底，把中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮走资派，连同他们的“阶级斗争熄灭”论之类的黑货统统扫进历史的垃圾箱！
