The industrial front in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is seeing better revolutionary and production situations. The exposure of class struggle is promoting the development of production.

Since this year, the production of most factories and mines in the region has been increasing month by month. In May, the total industrial output value of various places in the region increased significantly compared to April. For example, the total industrial output value of Hohhot City, Baotou City, Ulanqab League, and Hulunbuir League in May increased by 49% compared to April. The cumulative industrial output value of Hohhot City from January to May has increased compared to the same period last year and the year before.

Since last October, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary workers on the industrial front of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have extensively established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and promoted the continuous consolidation and development of revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones. So far, all factories and enterprises in Hohhot City and most factories and enterprises in other regions have established revolutionary committees.

After the proletarian revolutionary factions took power in various factories and mines, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, they led the broad revolutionary workers to carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism. The broad revolutionary workers, with their boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and their deep hatred for the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, such as China's Khrushchev, severely criticized China's Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia for their counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and angrily denounced their heinous crimes of attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. The revolutionary criticism has raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers, promoted ideological revolutionization, and driven industrial production to new heights.

The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more complex and profound the class struggle becomes. This year, when the basic revolutionary committees in the industrial front of the region were being established, a handful of class enemies, sensing their doom, tried every means to sabotage and disrupt. The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary workers, remembering Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," under the leadership of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, timely exposed the tricks of the class enemies and gave them a resolute blow.

Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary people it leads and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Following Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the industrial front of the region began to extensively establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes from mid-to-late April, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and launching more fierce attacks on the class enemies. The study classes in Hohhot City and Baotou City had tens of thousands of revolutionary workers participating in the study. The broad revolutionary workers resolutely opposed right opportunism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism, and continued to deeply expose the class struggle cover-ups in the industrial departments and various factories and mines, making the class enemies fall into the vast sea of people's war. A handful of stubborn reactionaries, traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries were dug out, and the revolutionary masses implemented dictatorship over them.

"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." Some backward factories and enterprises have undergone a complete transformation in their revolutionary and production situations after this struggle. Many workers in various factories and mines deeply criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents, such as "material incentives," "bonus system," and "expert management." They followed Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance and hard struggle, and carried out technological innovation activities. The revolutionary workers of the Inner Mongolia Power Machinery Factory in Hohhot City completed 21 technological innovation projects in less than two months.

The revolutionary workers on the industrial front of the region resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "save more and make revolution," and extensively carried out production and savings activities. The revolutionary workers of the Baotou Cotton Mill saved enough yarn to weave 90,000 meters of cloth and 60,000 meters of packaging cloth in this activity. The revolutionary workers of the Baotou Tractor Parts Factory recovered 800 tools and parts and 60 tons of aluminum and copper shavings.

    内蒙古自治区工业战线革命和生产形势越来越好
    大揭阶级斗争盖子促进生产发展
    今年以来，全区大多数厂矿生产逐月上升，五月份全区各地工业总产值普遍比四月份提高
    新华社呼和浩特十五日电　内蒙古自治区工业战线上的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，以革命统帅生产，带动生产，全区工业战线革命和生产形势越来越好。
    今年以来，全区大多数厂矿生产逐月上升。五月份全区各地工业总产值普遍比四月份提高，如呼和浩特市、包头市、乌兰察布盟、呼伦贝尔盟四个盟市，五月份的工业总产值比四月份提高了百分之四十九。呼和浩特市一至五月份累计工业总产值，比去年、前年同期都有增长。
    内蒙古自治区工业战线的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，从去年十月以来，普遍大办毛泽东思想学习班，积极落实毛主席的最新指示，推动革命大联合和革命三结合不断巩固和发展。到目前为止，呼和浩特市的全部工厂企业和其他地区的绝大部分厂矿企业，都建立了革命委员会。
    各厂矿无产阶级革命派掌权以后，在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，率领广大革命职工，深入持久地开展革命大批判。广大革命职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚，对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的无比仇恨，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线，愤怒控诉他们妄图颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。革命的大批判，使广大革命职工提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，促进了思想革命化，推动工业生产蒸蒸日上。
    无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是复杂，越是深刻。今年以来，正当全区工业战线上的基层革命委员会纷纷建立的时候，一小撮阶级敌人预感到末日来临，千方百计地进行破坏和捣乱。无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，在自治区革命委员会的领导和人民解放军的帮助下，及时揭露了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，给予迎头痛击。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”遵照毛主席这一最新指示，全区工业战线从四月中下旬开始，普遍大办毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习毛主席这一最新指示，向阶级敌人发动了更加猛烈的进攻。呼和浩特市和包头市的学习班，共有十几万革命职工参加学习。广大革命职工坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，继续深入揭开工业部门和各厂矿的阶级斗争盖子，使阶级敌人陷入了“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中，一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子，一个个被挖了出来，由革命群众对他们实行了专政。
    “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”有一些落后的厂矿企业经过这一场斗争，革命和生产面貌焕然一新。许多厂矿的革命职工，深入地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”、“专家治厂”等反革命修正主义黑货。他们遵照毛主席关于自力更生、艰苦奋斗的教导，开展了技术革新活动。呼和浩特市内蒙古动力机厂的革命职工，在不到两个月的时间里，就完成了二十一个技术革新项目。
    全区工业战线的革命职工坚决响应毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大号召，普遍开展了增产节约活动。包头棉纺厂革命职工在这一活动中清理出的经轴纱，可以织好布九万多米，包装布六万多米。包头拖拉机配件厂的革命职工清理回收工具、零件等八百多件，收回铝屑、铜屑六十多吨。
