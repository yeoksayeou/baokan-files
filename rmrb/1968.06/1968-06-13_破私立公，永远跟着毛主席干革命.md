The blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, spread to our Lantan Brigade. The poor and lower-middle peasants in our brigade first posted big-character posters criticizing me. The issues they raised were very sharp. I thought, "I, Zhang Changhai, have been a cadre for over ten years, always following Chairman Mao. I have worked hard and run around a lot, but I ended up with a lot of criticism. It's really a loss." Under the guidance of this wrong thinking, I felt that being a cadre was a loss and that it was better to be a community member and "relax." So, I dropped the cadre's responsibilities. This made the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary rebels even more critical of me. They said, "Zhang Changhai, it's wrong to lie down and not work! In the past, you often used Comrade Lin Biao's words to educate us, telling us to study Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind. Now you should also study Chairman Mao's works with these questions in mind!"

The heartfelt words of the poor and lower-middle peasants awakened me. I took my own ideological problems and re-studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao said, "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and pointing out our shortcomings. No matter who it is, if they point out our shortcomings, we should correct them. If your method is good for the people, we will follow it." When I read this, my face turned red. To be honest, I have memorized Chairman Mao's teachings and often used them to criticize others. Why can't I accept criticism from the masses and correct my mistakes according to Chairman Mao's teachings? After self-examination, I found that I am not without mistakes, but I have many shortcomings. I am nearly forty years old, and the old habits and bourgeois ideology have a great influence on me. I clearly have many shortcomings, but why can't I accept the masses' opinions? After thinking about it, it is the "selfishness" that is causing trouble: fear of ugliness, fear of pain, and fear of losing face.

I took this problem to Chairman Mao for guidance. Chairman Mao said, "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person feel sad when thinking of them. Can we still have personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, and mistakes that we cannot abandon?" Indeed, as a cadre, I have many shortcomings and mistakes. When the masses criticize me, I feel "cheated" and "not worth it." What about Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and countless revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their precious lives for the revolutionary cause? Thinking about it, I remembered my tragic family history. In the dark old society, my family had nothing. From a young age, I followed my parents, wandering and begging for food, living in hunger and cold all year round. My grandfather, second uncle, elder sister, second sister, and elder brother all died while wandering and begging. The evil old society destroyed my family. At that time, I carried a begging pole from one village to another, crying. Why didn't I feel ashamed or afraid of ugliness? Why now, after liberation, with no worries about food or clothing, as a cadre, do I feel ashamed and afraid of losing face when the masses criticize me? The root cause is that my status has changed, my thoughts have changed, and I have more selfish thoughts, and I can't listen to Chairman Mao's words. All evil comes from "selfishness," and all mistakes come from "me." Thinking about the past and looking at the present, I felt extremely sad. I should not have forgotten my roots after liberation, not have forgotten the masses after becoming a cadre, not have let "selfishness" blind me, and not have forgotten Chairman Mao's teachings. The masses criticizing me is to pull me back from the wrong path to the right path. If they don't criticize me now, when I fall into the capitalist quagmire, it won't be a matter of losing face or prestige, but of becoming a traitor to socialism and a criminal of history. Realizing this, I decided to follow Chairman Mao's teaching, "We Communist Party members should face the wind and rain and see the world; this wind and rain is the great storm of the masses' struggle, and this world is the great world of the masses' struggle," and bravely go to the masses to "show myself," make a thorough self-examination, let everyone analyze and criticize, and help me cleanse the dirt in my mind. I seriously examined myself to the masses, and the masses continued to trust me. In March of last year, I was elected as a member of the brigade's revolutionary leadership team.

Although I corrected my attitude towards the masses' criticism and stood up to work, I did not uproot the "selfishness." In the brigade's revolutionary leadership team of seven people, only my deputy and I were the original cadres. I thought: working with the proletarian revolutionary faction, I must be more careful, or they will rebel against me. So, when working, I dared not take responsibility, fearing to say the wrong words, give the wrong advice, and be criticized by others. Under this ideological guidance, I passively dealt with revolutionary work. Every time a meeting was held to discuss work, I would find a dark corner to squat down, just smoke, and not speak. When comrades asked me, I would only say some conformist words: "Okay," "Do as everyone thinks best," "I have no new opinions." The masses' eyes are sharp. After more than ten days like this, the masses' opinions about me came again. Some criticized me in front of me, saying, "Zhang Changhai, if you continue like this, you will make more mistakes." These criticisms were like a slap on my back. I thought, what should I do? I turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance. Chairman Mao said, "Communist Party members, no matter when and where, should not put personal interests first, but should put personal interests behind the interests of the nation and the people. Therefore, selfishness, laziness, corruption, and sectarianism are the most despicable; while selflessness, active efforts, self-discipline, and hard work are respectable." Chairman Mao's words were like a bright lamp, illuminating my mind: this fear and that fear, in essence, is fear of the masses, fear of the revolution, and the "selfishness" is causing trouble. True revolutionaries, for the people's interests, are not afraid of death, how can they be afraid of the masses and the revolution? Thinking of this, I decided to drive away the "selfishness," throw away the "fear," and take up the heavy responsibility of revolutionary work, and publicly made a self-criticism to the masses, examined my thoughts, and asked everyone to help and supervise me. After doing this, I felt light from head to toe and became active in revolutionary work again, no longer hiding in the corner during meetings, and taking on heavy responsibilities in work and production.

"Selfishness" is very stubborn, and it will not retreat easily, just like the class enemy. When the revolutionary criticism and struggle focused on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, I was very active. However, when it came to closely linking the struggle, criticism, and transformation with our unit, my enthusiasm waned. I thought: to criticize from the commune upwards, I am not afraid of criticizing anywhere; but if it is closely linked with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our unit, it would touch on my soul. Therefore, when writing big-character posters and speaking at meetings, I would avoid direct criticism and try to avoid actual examples that touched on my soul. Later, I saw reports in the newspapers about some brigade cadres actively participating in revolutionary criticism, all closely linked to the actual situation of their units, and I thought: why can't I do this? With this question in mind, I went to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, "A Communist Party member should be open-minded, honest, active, and put the revolutionary cause as the first priority, and personal interests should be subordinate to the revolutionary cause." I, in the face of revolutionary criticism, did not put the revolutionary cause as the first priority, but put personal interests first, and for the sake of personal "face," I did not even criticize revisionism. Isn't this being a deserter at the crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines? This is still following Chairman Mao's words and being loyal to Chairman Mao? Thinking of this, my revolutionary courage increased, and I took "Criticize selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, actively exposing and criticizing the "selfishness" in my mind at the community and militia meetings, and courageously exposing and criticizing the poison of the capitalist road line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev in our brigade over the past decade. The poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of militiamen saw my actions and praised, "Zhang Changhai is indeed a revolutionary cadre, just like us, a victim of the capitalist road line. We should concentrate all our hatred on the Chinese Khrushchev, criticize him deeply, thoroughly, and overturn him, and thoroughly eliminate the poison." The entire brigade quickly launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism.

The main person in charge of the brigade leadership team is a young man in his twenties and also a member of the commune leadership team. Due to work needs, he moved to the commune to live and no longer participated in labor. The masses had opinions about him, and sometimes when they saw him riding a bike back to our village, they would sarcastically say, "Oh! Is that Comrade X? What important instructions are you giving?" I thought: this comrade, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, listened to Chairman Mao's words, dared to take risks, and actively led the masses to rebel against the capitalist road line and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. However, after becoming a cadre, he became detached from the masses. If I don't help him correct this, he will make mistakes in the future. But then I thought: he is the first in command of the brigade leadership team, and I am a cadre who has made mistakes, with a face full of dust not yet washed off, how can I manage him? At this time, "public" and "private" in my mind drew battle lines again: to talk or not to talk, I was afraid of making a fool of myself; not to talk, but to see a comrade make mistakes, how could that be? I took this question to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor. Therefore, it is our combat task to train a large number of new cadres in a planned way." Chairman Mao also said, "Old and new cadres should respect each other, learn from each other, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, so as to unite and work together for a common cause, and prevent sectarian tendencies." After studying Chairman Mao's teachings, I realized that whether to help this comrade with enthusiasm or to watch him coldly is a matter of whether to act according to Chairman Mao's teachings and whether to care about the growth of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. I decided to have a heart-to-heart talk with him and together studied Chairman Mao's instructions: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses; everything should be based on the interests of the people, not on personal or small group interests." I said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to 'never leave the masses,' but from our village to the commune is so close, you often ride a bike back and forth and don't participate in labor. If you continue like this, you will become detached from the masses and make mistakes. Why did I make mistakes in the past? It was because after becoming the secretary of the party branch, I became detached from the masses and couldn't listen to the masses' opinions. You must not walk the old path of my mistakes. You are now the leader of the proletarian revolutionary faction in the brigade, your status has changed, and you should strictly require yourself." This comrade humbly accepted my opinions and moved his belongings back home. When there was work in the commune, he would go, and when there was no work, he would participate in labor in the brigade and become one with the masses again. This comrade corrected his shortcomings and changed his style, which also gave me a profound lesson: the proletarian revolutionary faction not only dares to rebel against the capitalist roaders but also dares to rebel against the "selfishness" in their own minds, which is worth learning from seriously.

The brigade militia company commander, because of a disagreement with the leader of the mass organization, said, "I won't be the company commander anymore" and wanted to hand over the gun. I heard this and got angry, scolding him without thinking. But it didn't solve the problem. That night, I studied Chairman Mao's instructions: "Communist Party members' attitude towards backward people is not to look down on them, but to be close to them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward." I felt that I had not handled this matter well. I decided to talk to him. Unexpectedly, he came to my house first. Before I could speak, he said bluntly, "Brother Zhang, I won't do it anymore! We have been close since we were young, escaping famine and begging together. I won't be a cadre, I'll be a community member, but I will still support you." I heard the words were wrong, so I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with him and learned, "Every Communist Party member should understand this truth: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'" I said, "Our feelings are good, we have slept in the same grass nest and begged in front of the same landlord's door. But if one of us thinks of 'public' and the other thinks of 'private,' 'public' and 'private' can never be united. If it develops, it will become a struggle between two roads. Saying this, from his expression, I saw that his thoughts were connected, so I continued, "Think about it, why did we escape famine and beg together in the old society? It was because we poor people had no guns and did not hold political power. Now Chairman Mao has saved us from the sea of suffering and let us hold the guns and the power, but now you are making trouble and don't want to continue the revolution. This is a big question of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Walking the revolutionary road of Chairman Mao, the community trusts us and asks us to be cadres, we must serve the people well." He was silent for a while, stood up, and said, "Brother Zhang, don't say anymore, I was wrong, I was entangled by a 'private' thought, I will definitely criticize selfishness and criticize revisionism and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life!" The next day, he seriously exposed and criticized his selfishness at the community meeting. Other members of the revolutionary leadership team also actively exposed and criticized their selfishness. From then on, the brigade's revolutionary leadership team became more united.

    破私立公，永远跟着毛主席干革命
    山东省邹县革委会副主任、高庄公社涝滩大队党支部书记　张长海
    正确对待群众的批评
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，燃烧到俺涝滩大队后，俺大队的贫下中农首先给我贴了大字报，问题提得很尖锐。我想：“我张长海当了十几年干部，都是跟着毛主席走的。我操了不少心，跑了不少腿，却落了一身不是，真亏得慌。”在这种错误思想的指导下，我觉得当干部吃了亏，不如当社员“清闲”。于是，我就撂下了干部挑子。这一来，贫下中农和革命造反派对我的意见更大了，他们批评我说：“长海，你躺倒不干不对呀！以前你经常用林彪副主席的话教育我们，要我们带着问题学习毛主席著作，你现在也应该带着这些问题向毛主席著作请教请教呀！”
    贫下中农的这番贴心话，提醒了我。我带着自己的思想问题重新学习《为人民服务》。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”读到这里，我脸上直发烧。说实在的，毛主席的这一教导我背得很熟，也常常用来批评别人。为什么自己受到群众的批评，就不能老老实实地按照毛主席的教导去正确对待呢？经过检查，我发现自己不是没有错误，而是有很多缺点错误。我是近四十岁的人了，旧的习惯势力和资产阶级思想对我的影响是很大的。我明明有许多缺点错误，为什么对群众的意见还接受不了呢？想来想去是“私”字作怪：怕丑，怕痛，怕丢面子。
    我又带着这个问题向毛主席请教。毛主席说：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”是啊，自己当干部，有很多缺点错误，群众批评批评，就觉得“吃亏”、“不够本”，那么张思德、白求恩、雷锋、王杰等无数革命先烈，为革命事业献出了宝贵的生命，又该怎么计算呢？想着想着，想起了我的悲惨的家史。在那暗无天日的旧社会，我家指地无有，我从小就跟父母四处逃荒要饭，一年到头过着饥寒交迫的生活。我的祖父、二叔、大姐、二姐、大哥都是逃荒要饭死在外头的。万恶的旧社会害得我家破人亡。那时，我天天挑着个要饭挑子，从这村哭到那村，为什么不觉得丢面子，也不怕丑呢？为什么现在翻了身，不愁吃，不愁穿，自己当了干部，群众批评一下，就觉得丑，就觉得丢面子呢？追根求源，是地位变了，思想变了，私心杂念多了，毛主席的话听不进去了。万恶全从“私”字起，千错都由“我”字生。想想过去，看看现在，我难过极了。千不该，万不该，自己不该翻身忘了本，不该当了干部忘了群众，不该让“私”字迷住心窍，忘了毛主席的教导。群众批评我，正是为了从邪路上把我拉到正道上来。现在不批评，等我走到资本主义泥坑里去，那就不是丢面子、丧失威信的问题，而是要成为社会主义的叛徒，成为历史的罪人了。认识到这一点，我就下决心遵照毛主席“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面”的教导，勇敢地到群众中去“亮相”，来个“磕筐底”的检查，让大家分析批判，帮助我洗刷头脑里的脏东西。我认真地向群众作了检查，群众就继续信任我。去年三月，选我为大队革命领导班子的成员。
    正确对待革命工作
    我虽然端正了对待群众批评的态度，站出来工作了，但是并没有把“私”字的根拔掉。大队革命领导班子七个人里，只有我和副队长是原来的干部。我想：和无产阶级革命派一块工作，得多加小心，弄不好他们还会造我的反。所以，工作起来不敢大胆负责，怕说错话，出错主意，别人抓自己的小辫子。在这种思想指导下，对革命工作就消极应付。每逢开会研究工作时，我就找个黑糊糊的墙角蹲下，光抽烟，不发言。同志们问我的时候，我净说些随大流的话：“行”，“大家看怎么办好就怎么办吧”，“我没有什么新的意见”。群众的眼睛是雪亮的。这样过了十多天，群众对我的意见又来了。有的当面批评我说：“长海，这样下去，你还得犯错误。”这些批评，象在我背上击一猛掌。心想：怎么办呢？我又向毛主席著作请教。毛主席说：“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。因此，自私自利，消极怠工，贪污腐化，风头主义等等，是最可鄙的；而大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干的精神，才是可尊敬的。”毛主席的话象一盏明灯，把我的思想一下子照亮了：这怕那怕，说穿了就是怕群众，怕革命，是“私”字作怪。真正的革命者为了人民的利益，死都不怕，哪有怕群众，怕革命的道理？想到这里，我决心赶走“私”字，丢掉“怕”字，把革命工作的重担挑起来，并且公开向群众作了自我批评，检查了思想，要求大伙经常帮助、监督。我这样做了以后，就觉得从头到脚一身轻，对革命工作又积极起来，开会不再蹲墙角，工作生产拣重担子挑。
    “私”字是很顽固的，它和阶级敌人一样不会轻易退走。革命大批判斗争矛头指向党内最大的一小撮走资派时，我很积极，可是当转到要和本单位斗批改紧密结合时，我的劲头就小了。心想：从公社往上轰，轰到那里我也不怕；要是和本单位斗批改相结合，那就要贴着我的边了。因此，写大字报，开会发言，我都拐弯抹角，尽量不和本单位的实际相结合，特别是避开触及我的灵魂的那些实际事例。后来，我看到报纸登的一些大队干部积极参加革命大批判的报道，都紧密结合本单位的实际情况，就想：我为什么不能这样做呢？带着这个问题，我又去学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。我呢？在革命大批判面前，不是以革命利益为第一生命，而是以个人利益为第一生命，为了个人的“面子”，连修正主义也不去批判了。这不是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻当逃兵吗？这还算什么听毛主席的话、忠于毛主席？想到这里，我的革命勇气增强了，就以“斗私，批修”为纲，主动地在社员、民兵大会上把我头脑里的“私”字亮出来，并且联系本单位十几年的实际情况，勇敢地揭发批判了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线在我们大队的流毒。贫下中农和广大民兵看到我这些行动，赞扬说：“长海真是个革命的干部，和咱们一样是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，咱要把千仇万恨都集中到中国赫鲁晓夫身上，把他批深、批透、批倒、批臭，彻底肃清流毒。”全大队很快就掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。
    正确对待新老干部
    大队领导班子主要负责人是个二十多岁的青年，又是公社领导班子的成员，因为工作需要，搬到公社去住，就不参加劳动啦。群众对他有意见，有时看到他骑着车子回俺村的时候，就讽刺说：“哦！那是×主任吧！又来作什么重要指示？”我就想：这个同志在无产阶级文化大革命中听毛主席的话，不怕任何风险，积极带领群众起来造资产阶级反动路线的反，捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。但是，当了干部后有些脱离群众，若不帮助他纠正，这样下去是要犯错误的。可是转念一想：人家是大队领导班子的第一把手，而自己是个犯过错误的干部，一脸灰尘还没洗净，怎么管人家呢？这时候，“公”和“私”在我脑子里又拉开了阵脚：谈吧，怕自己找难看；不谈吧，看着同志犯错误，怎么行呢？我又带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。因此，有计划地培养大批的新干部，就是我们的战斗任务。”毛主席又说：“新老干部应该是彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，以便团结一致，进行共同的事业，而防止宗派主义的倾向。”学习了毛主席的这些教导后，我认识到，对这个同志的缺点，是热情帮助，还是冷眼旁观，关系到是不是按毛主席教导办事的问题，是不是关心无产阶级革命事业接班人成长的问题。我就下决心找他谈心，一起学习了毛主席的指示：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。我说：“毛主席教导咱‘一刻也不脱离群众’，可是从咱村到公社这么近，你经常骑着车子来来往往，也不参加劳动啦，这样下去就会脱离群众，要犯错误。我以前为什么犯错误？就是当了党支部书记以后，脱离群众，对群众的意见听不进去。你可不能再走我犯错误的老路啦。你现在是大队无产阶级革命派的领头人，地位变化了，更应该严格要求自己。”这个同志虚心地接受了我的意见，从此就把行李搬回家来，公社有事就去，没事就在大队参加劳动，又和群众打成一片了。这个同志纠正了缺点，转变了作风，也使我受到了一次深刻的教育：无产阶级革命派不仅能勇敢地造走资派的反，也敢于造自己头脑中“私”字的反，值得我认真学习。
    大队民兵连长，因为和群众组织负责人闹了点意见，就说：“这个民兵连长我不当了”。并要把枪交出来。我一听就火了，没头没脑地把他批评了一顿，但是没有解决问题。晚上，我学习了毛主席的指示：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”感到自己对这件事处理得不好。我就决定找他去谈谈。不料他主动到我家来了。没等我说话，他就直截了当地说：“长海哥，我不干啦！咱俩从小就不错，在一块逃过荒，要过饭。我不当干部当社员，也保证拥护你，支持你。”我一听话不对头，就同他一块学习了《为人民服务》这篇光辉著作，又学了“每个共产党员都应懂得这个真理：‘枪杆子里面出政权’。”我说：咱俩的感情是不错，在一个草窝睡过觉，在一个地主的门口要过饭。但是，如果咱们俩一个想的是“公”字，一个想的是“私”字，“公”和“私”是怎么也团结不到一块去的。发展下去，就要形成两条道路的斗争。说到这里，从他的表情上看，和他的思想接茬了，我就接着说：“你想一想，咱俩在旧社会为什么一块逃荒要饭受压迫？就是因为咱穷人没有枪杆子，没有掌握政权。如今毛主席从苦海里把咱救出来，让咱掌握枪杆子，掌握印把子，可是你现在闹着不要枪杆子啦，不愿继续干革命啦。这是忠不忠于毛主席的大问题。走毛主席的革命道路，社员信得过我们，叫我们当干部，就得好好为人民服务。”他沉默了一阵子，站起来说：“长海哥，你别说了，我错啦，叫一个‘私’字把我缠住了，我一定好好地斗私批修，跟毛主席干一辈子革命！”第二天，他在群众大会上认真地亮私斗私。革命领导班子的其他成员也一个个自觉地亮私斗私。从此，大队的革命领导班子团结得更好了。
