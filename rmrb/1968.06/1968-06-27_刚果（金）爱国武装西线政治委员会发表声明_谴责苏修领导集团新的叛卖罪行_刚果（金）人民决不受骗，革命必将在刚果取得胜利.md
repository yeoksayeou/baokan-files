The Patriotic Armed Forces Western Front Political Committee of the Congo (Kinshasa) recently issued a statement condemning the new treacherous acts of the Soviet revisionist leadership group. The statement strongly denounces the Soviet revisionist group for sending an "ambassador" to the puppet regime of the U.S. imperialist lackey Mobutu and presenting "credentials" to Mobutu on June 21. This is a new act of betrayal against the Congolese people.

The statement points out that the Soviet revisionist traitor group has sent its first "plenipotentiary ambassador" to the puppet regime of Mobutu, who murdered Lumumba and many Congolese compatriots. This restoration of "diplomatic relations" between them is a great insult to the Congolese people.

The statement says: "The Soviet revisionists have decided to maintain mutual cooperation, friendly relations, and trade relations with this bloodthirsty puppet Mobutu. He is a great traitor and an agent of the CIA in Africa. Imperialists, with his help, murdered the fighting hero of Africa, Lumumba, on September 14, 1960." The statement says: "The Congolese people have no room for compromise with U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist group. The Congolese people severely condemn the reactionary stance of the Soviet leaders."

The statement points out: "Mobutu has not changed his nature as a lackey of U.S. imperialism. On the contrary, it is the Soviet revisionists who claim that Mobutu has changed, joining the ranks of the counter-revolution."

The statement strongly condemns the savage oppression and brutal suppression of the progressive forces in the Congo (Kinshasa) by the Mobutu puppet regime. It exposes the despicable intentions of the Soviet revisionist group in colluding with U.S. imperialism and the Mobutu regime to strangle the revolutionary forces in the Congo (Kinshasa). The statement says: "The Soviet revisionists have completely abandoned proletarian internationalism and the world revolution, helping the fascist regime of Mobutu to oppress the unconquerable Congolese people, attempting to make them surrender to imperialism."

The statement says that the Congolese people have learned from their own struggles and from the treacherous activities of the Soviet revisionist group around the world. They will not be deceived.

The statement finally points out: "No matter what, the revolution will triumph in the Congo. The people of the Soviet Union, educated by Lenin and Stalin, will also rise up to rebel against the Khruchev revisionist group."

    刚果（金）爱国武装西线政治委员会发表声明
    谴责苏修领导集团新的叛卖罪行
    刚果（金）人民决不受骗，革命必将在刚果取得胜利
    新华社二十六日讯 刚果（金）爱国武装西线政治委员会最近就苏修领导集团向美帝国主义的走狗蒙博托傀儡集团派出“大使”，并于二十一日向蒙博托递交“国书”一事发表声明，强烈谴责苏修集团对刚果（金）人民犯下的新的叛卖罪行。
    声明指出，苏修叛徒集团向杀害卢蒙巴和许多刚果（金）同胞的杀人犯蒙博托傀儡集团派出了它的第一任“全权大使”，从而恢复它们之间的“外交关系”，这是对刚果（金）人民的莫大侮辱。
    声明说：“苏联修正主义者决定与它保持相互合作和友好关系以及贸易关系的这个嗜血成性的傀儡蒙博托，是一个大叛徒，是（美国）中央情报局在非洲的代理人，帝国主义者在一九六○年九月十四日曾假手于他杀害了战斗的非洲的英雄（卢蒙巴）。”声明说：“刚果人民同美帝国主义和苏修集团毫无妥协的余地，刚果人民严厉谴责苏联头目们的反动立场。”
    声明指出：“蒙博托根本没有改变他的美帝走狗的本性。恰恰相反，正是硬说什么蒙博托已经变了的苏修之流参加了反革命的行列。”
    声明强烈谴责蒙博托傀儡政权对刚果（金）进步力量的野蛮压迫和疯狂镇压，并揭露苏修集团勾结美帝和蒙博托集团扼杀刚果（金）革命力量的卑鄙目的。声明说：“苏联修正主义者完全背弃了无产阶级国际主义和世界革命，帮助蒙博托的法西斯政权压迫不可征服的刚果人民，企图使他们向帝国主义屈膝投降。”
    声明说，刚果（金）人民从自己的斗争经验中并从苏修集团在世界各地的叛卖活动中吸取了教训，他们决不会受骗。
    声明最后指出：“不管怎么样，革命必将在刚果取得胜利，列宁和斯大林教育出来的苏联人民，也必将起来造赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的反。”
