Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's great work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," our amateur Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of soldiers has carried out propaganda activities for eleven years. However, our growth path has been bumpy and full of struggles. Each of us, with a heart infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, has followed Chairman Mao's teachings to engage in uncompromising struggles against bourgeois ideology and the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary black line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art belong to a definite class and are geared to a definite political line." Through our struggles, we have come to understand that the development of what kind of literature and art is actually a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads in the field of literature and art. Our Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team must listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, and stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, striving to realize Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Around 1961, when a counter-revolutionary current against socialism emerged in society, we responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "never forget class struggle" by promptly creating and performing programs that advocated for collective efforts, opposed individual farming, and smashed the plots of class enemies to restore capitalism. We used the serious facts of class struggle to educate the masses to remember Chairman Mao's teachings and never forget class struggle. In the face of the crazy threats of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek to invade the mainland, we also staged dances that exposed the reactionary nature of imperialism and all reactionaries as paper tigers and depicted the heroic spirit of PLA soldiers who are determined to fight to the death. These programs were extracted from the lives of the soldiers and from real struggles, welcomed by the masses, and played the role of "uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy." Because of this, the gang of anti-revolutionary revisionists led by Zhou Yang fiercely attacked and cursed us. They said our "gun-barrel poetry" was "lacking in poetic flavor but rich in gunpowder, stimulating the nerves." They slandered our singing as "shouting songs" and said our programs were "bean sprouts that can't reach the sky" and "can't enter the grand hall."

At that time, some comrades in our team were shaken and wanted to learn those "big, foreign, and ancient" things. We even performed the so-called "famous tune" "Flowers and Youth." During the performance, there was a large display on stage, with blowing and pulling instruments playing energetically. After the music ended, we stood on stage without leaving, waiting for the applause to end before starting the second piece. Who would have thought that the audience's reaction was very cold, which was like a bucket of cold water poured over us. After the performance, we studied "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" with this problem in mind. Chairman Mao teaches us that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, "only with things that the workers, peasants, and soldiers need and can easily accept." This is indeed a sharp criticism that hit the nail on the head. Originally, the "Flowers and Youth" we performed was not something the workers, peasants, and soldiers needed. The soldiers said, we think about how to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao, who has the leisure to think about flowers and birds? This made us further realize that if we force bourgeois things onto the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we would deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary direction, and this path would not work.

A comrade in our team who engaged in musical creation also took a detour because he did not act according to Chairman Mao's teachings. He wanted to express the life of the troops through music as soon as he enlisted. However, influenced by the bourgeois literary black line, he focused only on technique, flipping a few notes back and forth, writing songs that sounded foreign, feeling very proud of himself, while the masses felt that these songs were difficult to sing and hard to understand. The masses did not approve, and he himself was also troubled. Later, he studied Chairman Mao's "Talks" and found the root of his problem. It was Chairman Mao's teachings that made him realize: not being familiar with the life of the soldiers, lacking the true feelings of the soldiers, not caring about the needs of the masses, and showing off techniques without an audience, "that is just self-proclaimed purity, and the masses will not approve." In his subsequent creative activities, he worked with the backbone of the company's singing group to write programs for the company's evening parties. He treated the workers, peasants, and soldiers as his teachers and invited them to be the first audience. He also, according to the needs of class struggle, boldly broke the rules, using music to express major political themes and portray heroes nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. With the help of his comrades, he wrote the songs "Comrade Lin Biao Issues the Call" and "Hero Lu Xiangbi Saves the Red Guards." The songs have singing and dancing, and the performance is deeply loved by the broad masses of cadres and soldiers and the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

In this struggle, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "only by representing the masses can one educate the masses, only by being a student of the masses can one be a teacher of the masses," and treated the workers, peasants, and soldiers as the most authoritative reviewers. When rehearsing a dance, to better express the soldiers' thoughts and feelings, we added a dialogue in the dance. The bourgeois gentlemen said, is this dancing or acting? It's really "neither fish nor fowl." We took this program to the masses and asked the soldiers for their opinions, and came to the opposite conclusion. The masses said that adding dialogue to the dance made it more intimate and easier to understand, and enthusiastically affirmed our direction. It was with this strong support that we resolutely fought back against the attacks of the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary black line. The bourgeois gentlemen said our recitations lacked poetic flavor but were rich in gunpowder and stimulating to the nerves. We wanted to use the revolutionary gunpowder to drive away the ghosts and monsters of the old stage. The bourgeois gentlemen slandered our singing as "shouting songs." We wanted to shout loudly for the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought. We didn't care about their "four nots" or "eight nots" and their rules, and we wanted to use the thousand-pound hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to clean up the remnants of the old literary stage of the gods, emperors, and feudal lords.

In 1965, our Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, with the expectations of all comrades in the troops, went to Beijing to participate in the third batch of the PLA amateur performance team's adjustment performance. We, who were slandered by the bourgeois gentlemen as "bean sprouts that can't reach the sky," finally "reached the sky." During the performance in the capital, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers encouraged us, saying, "Watching one performance is like attending one vivid political class"; while the anti-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang, at that time, watched our performance and was so frightened that his face turned yellow, his brows furrowed, and he dared not say a word, tucking his tail and running away. What a stark contrast! During our stay in Beijing, the most unforgettable event was on February 22, 1965, when our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao received all the amateur cultural warriors participating in the adjustment performance. We saw Chairman Mao, whom we had been longing for day and night! We shouted loudly, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" In January of this year, representatives of our propaganda team attended the Second Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works of the Air Force and had the happiness of seeing our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao again. Dear Chairman Mao! It is you who have illuminated our hearts, nurtured our growth, and shown us the direction forward. We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and be lifelong red propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

    建设一支永远忠于毛主席的红色宣传队
    中国人民解放军空军某部毛泽东思想宣传队
    在毛主席的伟大著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的光辉照耀下，我们这支战士业余毛泽东思想宣传队，坚持了十一年的宣传活动，但是我们的成长道路是不平坦的，是充满着斗争的。我们每个战士，以一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，按照毛主席的教导，同资产阶级思想，同反革命修正主义文艺黑线，进行了不调和的斗争。
    毛主席教导我们说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”我们在斗争的实践中体会到，发展什么样的文艺，实际上就是在文艺领域里的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。我们毛泽东思想宣传队，必须听毛主席的话，走毛主席指引的路，站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，为实现毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而奋斗。
    一九六一年前后，社会上出现了一股反社会主义逆流时，我们响应毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，及时编演了提倡集体，反对单干和粉碎阶级敌人阴谋复辟资本主义的节目，用阶级斗争的严重事实，教育广大群众牢记毛主席的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争。在美蒋妄图窜犯大陆的疯狂叫嚣面前，我们又编排了揭露帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的反动本质，和表现解放军战士誓死杀敌的英雄气概的舞蹈，给部队作了形象的生动的战备动员。这些节目都是从连队里，从现实斗争生活里提炼出来的，受到了群众的欢迎，起到了“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的作用。正因为这样，周扬一伙反革命修正主义分子疯狂地围攻和咒骂我们。骂我们枪杆诗是“诗味不足，火药味有余，刺激神经”。污蔑我们唱歌是“喊歌”，说我们的节目都是些“豆芽菜，上不了天”，登不上“大雅之堂”。
    这时候，我们队里有些同志曾经一度产生了动摇，想学那些“大、洋、古”的东西，还演出了《花儿与少年》这支所谓“名曲”。在演出的时候，台上摆了一大摊子，吹的、拉的也很卖劲，曲子演奏完了，还站在台上不走，想等着鼓完掌再来第二个。谁知道观众反应很冷淡，这真是给我们泼了一瓢清凉水。演出后，我们带着这个问题学习了《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。毛主席教导我们说，文艺为工农兵服务，“只有用工农兵自己所需要、所便于接受的东西。”这真是一针见血，击中了我们的要害。原来我们演的《花儿与少年》根本就不是工农兵需要的东西。战士们说，我们想的是怎样做一个毛主席的好战士，那有那份闲心去想那些花呀鸟呀的一套。这才使我们进一步认识到，如果把资产阶级的东西硬拿来塞给工农兵，这就背离了毛主席的革命文艺方向，此路必定不通。
    我们队里一个搞音乐创作的同志，过去由于没有按照毛主席的教导办事，也走了一段弯路。他刚刚入伍就想用音乐表现部队生活。但由于受资产阶级文艺黑线的影响，光在技巧上下功夫，把几个音符颠来倒去，写的曲子洋里洋气，自己感到很美，而群众反映这些曲子唱着费劲，听着不懂。群众批不准，他自己也苦恼。后来，他学习了毛主席的《讲话》，找到了自己的病根。是毛主席的教导使他认识到：不熟悉战士的生活，缺乏战士的真实感情，不顾群众的需要，无对象地卖弄技巧，“那只是自封为清高，群众是不会批准的。”在以后的创作活动中，他就和连队演唱组的骨干在一起，编写连队晚会的节目。拜工农兵群众为老师，请他们做第一批观众。他还根据阶级斗争的需要，大胆破格，用音乐表现重大的政治题材，表现用毛泽东思想哺育成长的英雄人物。在同志们的帮助下，他写出了《林副主席发号召》，《英雄吕祥璧舍身救红卫兵》等乐曲。乐曲中有拉有唱，演奏时有歌有舞，深受广大指战员和工农兵群众的欢迎。
    在这场斗争中，我们遵照毛主席“只有代表群众才能教育群众，只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生”的教导，把工农兵群众当做最有发言权的审批者。我们在排演一个舞蹈时，为了更好地表达战士的思想感情，在舞蹈中加了一段对话，资产阶级老爷们看了说，这是跳舞，还是演话剧？真是“四不象”。我们带着这个节目，到群众里面去，请战士提意见，就得出了相反的结论。群众说舞蹈中加上对话，感到更加亲切，更加好懂了，热情地肯定了我们的方向。我们正是依靠这些有力的支持，狠狠地反击了反革命修正主义文艺黑线对我们的围攻。资产阶级老爷们说我们的朗诵诗“诗味不足，火药味有余，刺激神经”，我们就是要用革命的火药味，赶走旧舞台上的才子佳人、牛鬼蛇神。资产阶级老爷们污蔑我们唱歌是“喊歌”，我们就是要为宣传毛泽东思想而大喊大叫。我们不管它什么“四不象”、“八不象”和什么清规戒律，就是要用毛泽东思想的千钧棒，清除旧文艺舞台上帝、封、修的残渣。
    一九六五年，我们毛泽东思想宣传队带着部队全体同志的期望，到北京参加了全军战士业余演出队第三批调演。我们这些被资产阶级老爷们污蔑为“上不了天”的“豆芽菜”终于“上天了”。在首都演出期间，广大指战员鼓励我们说：“看一次演出，就是上了一堂形象的政治课”；而反革命修正主义分子周扬当时看了我们演出，却吓得脸色蜡黄，愁眉苦脸的，不敢吭一声，夹着尾巴就溜走了。这是多么鲜明的对比。在北京期间，最使我们难忘的，是一九六五年二月二十二日，我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席，接见了参加调演的全体业余文艺战士，我们见到了日夜想念的毛主席！我们放开嗓门高呼毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！今年一月，我们宣传队的代表出席了空军第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，又一次幸福地见到我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。敬爱的毛主席啊！是您照亮了我们的心，哺育着我们成长，给我们指明了前进的方向。我们一定要永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，做一辈子毛泽东思想的红色宣传员。
