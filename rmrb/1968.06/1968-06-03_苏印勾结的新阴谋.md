Not long ago, the traitorous Soviet revisionist clique's Pacific Fleet Commander Amelko hurriedly "visited" India with three warships and held secret talks in New Delhi with the Indian Defense Minister and naval chiefs, "discussing the increasingly developing cooperation between the Indian and Soviet navies." This is a new step taken by the Soviet revisionist traitorous clique in collusion with the Indian reactionaries to frenziedly oppose China and actively serve U.S. imperialism.

The Soviet-Indian collusion, a shameful alliance, has a long history. Since Khrushchev usurped power, the Soviet revisionist traitorous clique has not only politically tried to bolster the wobbly Indian National Congress reactionary government but also economically and militarily pumped in blood. Now, the Soviet revisionist traitorous clique has become India's largest military "aid" supplier, the second-largest creditor, and the third-largest trading partner. The comings and goings between the Soviet revisionist traitorous clique and the Indian reactionaries have become commonplace. In recent years, the Soviet revisionists have increasingly tightened their assistance to the Indian reactionaries in "expanding" their navy, which is a new sinister plot in their collusion.

Last July, the Indian Navy Chief visited Moscow, and the Soviet revisionist traitorous clique decided to provide naval equipment to the Indian reactionaries. In late January this year, Kosygin rushed to New Delhi, expressing his willingness to provide more military "assistance" to meet India's so-called "extraordinary defense needs" and to help build the Indian navy. Immediately afterward, the Soviet Navy Commander Gorshkov went to India, "proposing specific suggestions to his New Delhi counterparts to lay the foundation for regular close cooperation between the Russian and Indian navies." According to the British Sunday Telegraph, under a recent Soviet-Indian naval agreement, the Soviet revisionists will provide New Delhi with twenty-one warships, including four submarines, while India will grant the Soviet fleet the use of two bases in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. This time, Amelko led the fleet to India, further tightening the Soviet-Indian naval collusion.

Why is the Soviet revisionist traitorous clique so eager to help the Indian reactionaries develop their navy now?

It turns out that British imperialism, deeply mired in serious political and economic crises, has been forced to announce the premature withdrawal of its colonial troops from Southeast Asia and the Middle East under the fierce impact of the world revolutionary storm. This is also a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialist counter-revolutionary global strategy. U.S. imperialism has always used British imperialism as its accomplice in invading Asia. When it concentrated its forces on the Vietnam War, it intended to rely on British imperialism to defend the second line in Asia. However, just as U.S. imperialism was mired in the Vietnam War and unable to extricate itself, Britain announced the premature withdrawal of troops from east of Suez, making the already short-handed U.S. imperialism even more stretched and isolated.

The Soviet revisionist traitorous clique is now frantically tightening its naval collusion with the Indian reactionaries, with frequent visits, secret plotting, providing naval equipment, and training technical personnel, busily trying to build a "decent" navy for the Indian reactionaries, further extending its black hand into the Indian Ocean region, expanding its neo-colonialist influence, and further controlling India. At the same time, the Soviet revisionist traitorous clique attempts to use this method to help U.S. imperialism fill the so-called "vacuum" in the Indian Ocean region. The Soviet revisionist traitorous clique aims to strengthen the anti-China encirclement jointly operated by the U.S. and the Soviet Union, directing its spearhead at our great People's Republic of China, and suppressing the burgeoning revolutionary armed struggles of the peoples of Southeast Asia. The Soviet revisionist traitorous clique's despicable actions once again barefacedly exposed their shameful faces as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism and traitors who betray the interests of the revolutionary peoples of the world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Beginning with the intention to harm others, ending with harm to oneself. This will be the inevitable outcome of all reactionary policies." It can be foreseen that all the efforts of the Soviet revisionist traitorous clique to collude with the Indian reactionaries to control the Indian Ocean will be in vain. They will not only fail to save U.S. imperialism from its inevitable doom but will also inevitably tighten more nooses around their own necks, thus hastening their own demise. As for the double traitors of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists—the Indian reactionaries—they will ultimately perish for their masters.

    苏印勾结的新阴谋
    东海舰队某舰战士
    不久以前，苏修叛徒集团的太平洋舰队司令阿梅尔科带了三条兵舰急急忙忙地“访问”印度，并在新德里同印度国防部长和海军头目进行了密谈，“讨论了印苏海军日益发展的合作”。这是苏修叛徒集团伙同印度反动派疯狂反华、积极为美帝国主义效劳的一个新步骤。
    苏印勾结，狼狈为奸，由来已久。从赫鲁晓夫篡夺政权开始，苏修叛徒集团就不仅在政治上竭力为摇摇欲坠的印度国大党反动政府打气，而且在经济上、军事上拚命输血。如今，苏修叛徒集团已成为印度最大的军“援”供应国、第二大债权国和第三位贸易国。苏修叛徒集团和印度反动派之间的往来，人们早已司空见惯了。近年来，苏修日益加紧帮助印度反动派“扩建”海军，这是苏印勾结的一个新的罪恶阴谋。
    去年七月，印度海军总司令访问莫斯科，苏修叛徒集团便决定向印度反动派提供海军装备。今年一月底，柯西金跑到新德里，表示将给予更多的军事“帮助”，以满足印度的所谓“额外的国防需要”，并准备“帮助建设印度海军”。紧接着，苏修海军总司令戈尔什科夫又前往印度，“向他的新德里的同僚提出了具体的建议，为俄国和印度海军经常紧密合作奠定基石”。据英国《星期日电讯报》透露，根据最近签订的一个苏印海军协定，苏修将为新德里提供二十一艘战舰，其中有四艘潜水舰；而印度则给予苏修舰队使用在安达曼群岛和尼科巴群岛的两个基地。这次，阿梅尔科率领舰队到印度活动，又进一步加紧了苏印海军的勾结。
    为什么现在苏修叛徒集团如此迫不及待地要帮助印度反动派发展海军呢？
    原来，已经深深陷入政治、经济严重危机中的英帝国主义，在世界革命风暴的猛烈冲击下，穷途末路，被迫宣布提前撤走它在东南亚和中东地区的殖民军。这也是对美帝国主义反革命全球战略的一个沉重打击。美帝国主义一向利用英帝国主义作为它侵略亚洲的帮凶，在它集中力量进行侵越战争的时候，想依靠英帝国主义在亚洲防守第二线。但是，正当美帝国主义在侵越战争中深陷泥潭、无法自拔的时候，英国却宣布提前从苏伊士以东撤军，这就使早已深感兵力不足的美帝国主义更加顾此失彼、更加孤立无援了。
    苏修叛徒集团现在拚命加紧与印度反动派在海军方面的勾结，又是互相访问，密谋策划，又是提供舰艇装备，培训技术人员，忙得不可开交，妄图给印度反动派扶植一支“象样的”海军，把自己的黑手进一步伸入印度洋地区，扩张它的新殖民主义势力，进一步控制印度。同时苏修叛徒集团妄图用这种手段，帮助美帝国主义去填补印度洋地区的所谓“真空”。苏修叛徒集团妄图以此来加固美苏合伙经营的反华包围圈，把矛头指向我们伟大的中华人民共和国，并镇压正在蓬勃发展中的东南亚各国人民的革命武装斗争。苏修叛徒集团的这一卑鄙行径，又一次赤裸裸地暴露了他们充当美帝国主义头号帮凶和出卖世界革命人民利益的叛徒的可耻嘴脸。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“以损人的目的开始，以害己的结果告终。这将是一切反动政策的发展规律。”可以肯定，苏修叛徒集团勾结印度反动派妄图控制印度洋的一切努力都是徒劳的。他们不仅无法挽救美帝国主义必然灭亡的命运，而且势必要在自己的脖子上套上更多的绞索，从而使它自己加速走向坟墓。至于美帝、苏修的双料奴才——印度反动派，到头来也只能为它的主子殉葬。
