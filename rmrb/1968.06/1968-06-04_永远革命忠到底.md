	Forever Revolutionary, Loyal to the End
	Rong Guanxiu

	The heroic comrade Men He is always loyal to Chairman Mao, always loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and always loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In his mind, he has thoroughly uprooted the "selfish" roots of the bourgeoisie and built a great wall of proletarian "public spirit." His life truly embodies: always thinking of Chairman Mao, always obeying Chairman Mao, always following Chairman Mao, and always working for Chairman Mao.

	I was born into a poor peasant family and suffered greatly under the old society. Under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, and under the radiant guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "wholeheartedly serving the people," through numerous struggles, I and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants firmly believed in Chairman Mao and closely followed him. We overthrew the landlords and tyrants and gained our own power. We poor and lower-middle peasants became the masters of our own fate. However, at this very moment, China's Khrushchev spread the fallacy of a "peaceful democratic new stage." I thought, this is completely different from what our great leader Chairman Mao said! It does not at all accord with the actual situation of class struggle. I said, "No matter who you are, if you do not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings and do not conform to the interests of the broad masses of the people, we will oppose you and resist you." I and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. To liberate the people of the whole country as soon as possible, I sent my son to join the army. I told my son, "You must fiercely strike down the Kuomintang reactionaries and defend our country and our great savior Chairman Mao." My son sacrificed his life in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and I did not shed a single tear. I said, he died for the defense of our country and Chairman Mao, he died a glorious death for the people.

	During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party colluded with unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, deceiving some of the masses, inciting the masses to fight against each other, and directing the spearhead against the poor and lower-middle peasants, fighting against us poor and lower-middle peasants. I thought, their struggle against us is a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. No matter what tricks or schemes they use, I must fight them to the end. With the full support of the People's Liberation Army, we smashed the arrogant attacks of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, achieved great revolutionary unity, and established a revolutionary committee. After the revolutionary committee was established, they again spread the rightist wind of reversal, stirring up contradictions between cadres and the masses. We poor and lower-middle peasants once again smashed the arrogant attacks of the class enemies and defended the newly born revolutionary power.

	For the Party, for the people, and for Chairman Mao, I have done some things that I should have done, but compared to the heroic comrade Men He, I still fall far short. The difference lies in the "use" of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and the "loyalty" to Chairman Mao. Although I am older than him and suffered greatly in the old society, in loving Chairman Mao, I am not as good as him. I will definitely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to "not rely on past merits but to create new achievements," humbly learn from the good cadre Men He, who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while alive and dedicate my life to it when dead. I will be like Men He, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

    永远革命忠到底
    戎冠秀
    英雄的门合同志，一贯忠于毛主席，一贯忠于毛泽东思想，一贯忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在他的脑子里，彻底挖掉了资产阶级“私”字的根子，筑起了无产阶级“公”字的长城。他的一生真正做到了：一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。
    我出生在一个贫农的家庭里，在旧社会饱受压迫。在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的光辉思想照耀下，在多次的斗争中，我和广大贫下中农一起，坚信毛主席，紧跟毛主席，斗倒了地主、恶霸，有了自己的政权，我们贫下中农当家做主了。可是就在这个时候，中国的赫鲁晓夫却放出了“和平民主新阶段”的谬论。我想，这可和我们伟大领袖毛主席说的不一样啊！根本不符合阶级斗争的实际情况。我说：“不管你是谁，凡是不符合毛主席的教导，不符合广大人民群众的利益，我们就是要反对，就是要抵制。”我和广大贫下中农坚决照毛主席的指示办事。为了全国人民早日得解放，我又送子参军。我告诉儿子说：“你要狠狠打击蒋匪军，消灭国民党反动派，保卫咱们的江山，保卫伟大救星毛主席。”儿子在抗美援朝战争中牺牲了，我没有掉一滴眼泪。我说，他是为保卫我们的江山、保卫毛主席，他为人民死得光荣。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，党内一小撮走资派勾结没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，蒙蔽了一部分群众，挑动群众斗群众，把矛头指向了贫下中农，斗争我们贫下中农。我想，他们同我们的斗争，是两个阶级、两条路线、两条道路的斗争。我不管他们耍什么花招，施什么诡计，也得和他们斗争到底。我们在解放军的全力支持下，打垮了地富反坏右的猖狂进攻，实现了革命的大联合，成立了革命委员会。革命委员会成立以后，他们又刮起了右倾翻案妖风，挑拨干群关系，我们贫下中农又一次粉碎了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，保卫了新生的革命政权。
    为党、为人民、为毛主席，我做了一些应做的事情，可是和英雄门合相比，还差得很远很远。千差万差，差就差在活学活用毛泽东思想的一个“用”字上和对毛主席的“忠”字上。我虽然年纪比他大，在旧社会受的苦也很深，可是在热爱毛主席上，我不如他。我一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席“不要吃老本，要立新功”的教导，虚心向“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志学习，生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身。一定象门合那样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
