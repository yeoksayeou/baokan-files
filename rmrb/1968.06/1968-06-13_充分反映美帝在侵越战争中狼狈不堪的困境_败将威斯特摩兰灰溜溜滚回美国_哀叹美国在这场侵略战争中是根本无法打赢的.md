The defeated general Westmoreland slinks back to the United States in disgrace, lamenting that the U.S. cannot win this war of aggression.

	New York, June 11 — The war criminal Westmoreland, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people, left his post as commander of the U.S. forces in Vietnam on June 11 and slunk back to the United States from Saigon.

	This replacement of the defeated general was announced by the U.S. President Johnson on March 22 of this year.

	Johnson was forced to take this "change of horses" action, fully reflecting the U.S. empire's embarrassing and helpless plight in the Vietnam War. Four years ago, Westmoreland, at Johnson's command, came to the Vietnam battlefield to act as the head of the U.S. forces in Vietnam. According to Johnson's will, he did his utmost to escalate the war in Vietnam, increasing the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam from over 20,000 to over 500,000. However, under the increasingly fierce attacks of the military and civilians in the South, each of Westmoreland's major "escalations" of the war met with even more disastrous failures.

	The failure of the war in Vietnam has plunged U.S. imperialism into an extremely serious political, military, and economic crisis. The infighting within the U.S. ruling class has reached an unprecedented level of intensity. In this difficult situation, Johnson was forced to remove this defeated general of the U.S. forces in Vietnam, using him as a "scapegoat" for the failure of the war in Vietnam.

	This Westmoreland, who came to the Vietnam battlefield four years ago, at his last press conference held in Saigon before leaving Vietnam, was forced to admit that the U.S. war of aggression is fundamentally unwinnable, and that "hoping for a quick and early defeat" of the Vietnamese people "is unrealistic." He also anxiously said that it is "almost impossible" to prevent the armed forces of the South from launching attacks and firing rockets at targets in Saigon. Westmoreland's lamentations fully show that no matter what tricks Johnson plays in the Vietnam War, he cannot escape a thorough defeat on the Vietnam battlefield.

    哀叹美国在这场侵略战争中是根本无法打赢的
    新华社十一日讯　西贡消息：双手沾满越南人民鲜血的战争罪犯威斯特摩兰十一日离开了他的侵越美军司令的职务，从西贡灰溜溜地滚回美国。
    这个越南人民手下的败将的被撤换，是美帝头子约翰逊在今年三月二十二日宣布的。
    约翰逊不得不又一次采取“换马”的行动，充分反映了美帝在侵越战争中狼狈不堪、一筹莫展的困窘境地。四年以前，威斯特摩兰奉约翰逊之命来到越南战场充当侵越美军头目以后，按照约翰逊的意旨竭力扩大侵越战争，使侵越美军从两万多人增加到五十多万人。但是，在南方军民越来越强烈的打击下，威斯特摩兰的每一次战争大“升级”，都遭到了更惨重的失败。
    侵越战争的失败使美帝国主义在政治上、军事上和经济上陷入了极端严重的危机，美国统治集团内部的争吵也达到了空前激烈的程度。在这种困难的情况下，约翰逊不得不撤换了这个侵越美军的败将，把他作为侵越战争失败的“替罪羊”。
    这个四年前来到越南战场的威斯特摩兰，在他滚出越南的前夕在西贡举行的最后一次记者招待会上，不得不承认，美国的这场侵略战争是根本无法打赢的，“指望迅速和早日打败”越南人民，“是不现实的”。他还惊慌地说，要阻止南方人民解放武装力量对西贡的目标发动袭击和发射火箭，“几乎是不可能办到的”。威斯特摩兰的这些哀鸣充分表明，不管约翰逊在侵越战争中玩弄什么样的手法，都逃不脱在越南战场上的彻底失败。
