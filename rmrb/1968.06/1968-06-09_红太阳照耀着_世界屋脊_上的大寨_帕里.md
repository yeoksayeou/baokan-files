The red sun shines on the "Roof of the World" - Pari. The heroic Tibetan farmers in the high-altitude city of Pari are resolutely responding to the great call of Chairman Mao Zedong to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture." With hearts full of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao, they are actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. In the icy peaks and snowy mountains, they are striving for progress, relying on their own efforts, working hard, and fighting against natural disasters. On the "Roof of the World," they have written a new chapter of glory.

In April, the snow-capped Himalayas are still covered with snowflakes. The heroic people of Pari, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" and boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, have welcomed the spring of the high-altitude city and fired the first shot of spring plowing and production.

After a few heavy snowstorms, the Tibetan farmers of Pari, carrying the giant portrait of Chairman Mao and the placard with the quotation "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history" in Tibetan, singing the heroic song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," braved the wind and snow to rush to the fields. Some drove carts to distant pastures to fetch fertilizer; others formed long lines, bared their arms, and wielded shovels and hoes to reclaim wasteland; still others, sweating profusely, carried large baskets to the fields to spread fertilizer. They are loyal to Chairman Mao and apply Mao Zedong Thought. They have turned the spring plowing fields into a large classroom for studying Chairman Mao's works. They placed bright red flags on the plow frames of the oxen, with red cloth on both sides bearing the revolutionary slogans "The fundamental question of revolution is the question of state power" and "Never forget class struggle." The plowmen studied while plowing.

Many elderly women and men who usually did not leave their homes often came to the fields with red "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" to study and work with everyone. They said: With the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome all difficulties and march from victory to victory.

Located at the foot of the "Goddess" Peak on the main ridge of the Himalayas, Pari is at an altitude of 4,300 meters. The terrain is high and cold, the climate is changeable, and the frost-free period averages only 30 days a year.

In 1967, the seventh year of large-scale trial cultivation of crops on the Himalayan plateau, through their hard work, the newly reclaimed more than 5,000 kl (1 kl is approximately 1 acre) of land had crops growing more vigorously. However, just as the barley was flowering and filling, the weather suddenly changed, and frost threatened the growth of the crops. On the night of the heavy frost, all the men, women, and children in the town rushed to the fields and lit more than 200 anti-frost smoke towers set up at the edges of the fields to let the smoke resist the frost. In the five consecutive battles against the severe frost, some people were so affected by the thick smoke that their heads ached and their eyes swelled, and some were so tired that their waists and legs ached, but no one left their posts.

One night, due to a sudden drop in temperature, a rare heavy snowfall occurred, freezing the barley ears into icicles and breaking the stalks under the weight of the snow. Facing such a snow disaster, they did not lose heart. After more than half a month of hard work, they finally recovered nearly 200,000 jin of grain.

In the face of production setbacks, some people thought that Pari, as a model unit like Dazhai, had such a small harvest, which was a bit embarrassing. Some even worried about whether they would encounter similar disasters the following year. At this time, a propaganda team composed of border defense soldiers came to Pari. They ate, lived, and worked with the liberated farmers, studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works together, and propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the masses.

With the help of the soldiers, the masses studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and his teachings on hard work and striving for progress. Chairman Mao taught: "In the face of difficulties, our comrades should see achievements, see the light, and raise our courage." Chairman Mao's instructions dispelled the knots in some people's minds and gave them great encouragement and boundless strength. The broad masses of liberated farmers said: We cannot just have the name of Dazhai without the spirit of Dazhai. They decided to carry forward the spirit of Dazhai, rely on their own efforts, overcome difficulties, and strive for new victories.

With the help of the border defense soldiers, Pari set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The Tibetan liberated farmers, with "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism and Fight Selfishness and Repudiate Revisionism" as the guiding principle and "Old Five Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions as weapons, carried out a thorough revolution in their souls, promoting the revolutionization of their thinking. They decided to farm well for the revolution, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, and strive to recover all the grain lost to frost and snow disasters in the new year. Many poor farmers resolutely stated that when encountering difficulties in production, they must not ask the state for help and must carry forward the spirit of self-reliance of Dazhai, relying on their own efforts to solve problems. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching: "Our policy is to rely on our own efforts, that is, self-reliance." They decided to go into the mountains to cut firewood to make up for the agricultural losses. They formed a logging team of more than 160 people, braved the wind and snow, entered the deep forests, cut wood and chopped firewood, and after a month of hard work, chopped tens of thousands of jin of firewood, sold it to the state, earning more than 11,000 yuan, not only solving the problem of production seeds but also solving the living problems of the poor households.

Just as the seed problem was solved, a dispute arose over the sowing area. Some advocated reducing the sowing area this year and focusing on increasing the yield per unit area; others believed that while increasing the yield per unit area, the sowing area should be greatly expanded. In this situation, the border defense soldiers again helped everyone study Chairman Mao's teachings on wholeheartedly serving the people and self-reliance and hard struggle. Chairman Mao said: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is a good comrade." Chairman Mao's teachings inspired the broad masses of liberated farmers. Many liberated farmers recalled the bitter sufferings they endured in the old society and the sweetness of the new society under Chairman Mao's leadership. They were full of energy and decided to expand the sowing area, launching a mass movement of "taking grain from the wilderness." People in the freezing fields, braving temperatures of minus thirty degrees, wielded hoes and shovels, reclaimed more than 300 kl of land, increasing the sowing area of grain crops to more than 6,000 kl.

With more land, more fertilizer was needed. Known as the "production pioneers," Phuntsok and Dawu, to find fertilizer for the collective, got up in the middle of the night, carrying the red revolutionary book, riding horses, crossing mountains, and walking long distances to find fertilizer. On the way, their feet were frozen numb, and their ears were frostbitten. But when they thought of Chairman Mao's teaching, "Care more about the party and the masses than about oneself, care more about others than about oneself," their hearts warmed, and they found boundless strength. In the vast snowfield, they searched several places and finally found a source of fertilizer more than 50 li away. They immediately organized manpower and drove 19 carts and more than 70 pack animals back to fetch the fertilizer. That night was a night of wind and snow, the cold wind blowing on their faces was like a knife cutting into the flesh. The liberated farmers huddled together back to back, reciting Chairman Mao's teachings over and over again: "With firm resolve, fearing neither sacrifice nor difficulty, surmounting all obstacles, and striving for victory." Everyone was full of fighting spirit and high morale. After days and nights of hard work, they finally brought back a large amount of fertilizer.

To achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture, the people of Pari also broke superstitions and launched a campaign to exterminate the field rats that seriously harm crops. In more than half a month, Pari mobilized more than 1,200 people to exterminate rats over an area of more than 600 kl. This was unprecedented in history.

Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "We must let hundreds of millions of people master Mao Zedong Thought, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions, use Mao Zedong Thought to change the spiritual face of the whole society, and let this great spiritual force of Mao Zedong Thought become a great material force!" The heroic people of Pari are mastering Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all ideological positions, and thus making the revolution and production advance from one victory to another. Under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, let the red flag of Dazhai on the "Roof of the World" fly high on the Himalayas!

    红太阳照耀着“世界屋脊”上的大寨——帕里
    战斗在世界高城——帕里的藏族翻身农民，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的心情，活学活用毛泽东思想，在冰峰雪岭间，奋发图强，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，抗天斗地，在“世界屋脊”上写下了新的光辉诗篇。
    四月，雪峰林立的喜马拉雅山区，仍然飞舞着雪花。英雄的帕里人民，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神和冲天的革命干劲，迎来了世界高城的春天，打响了春耕生产的第一炮。
    几场漫天大雪刚刚过去，帕里的藏族翻身农民们，就抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅彩像，扛着用藏文写的“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”的语录牌，唱着《大海航行靠舵手》的雄壮歌曲，顶风踏雪，奔赴田野。他们有的赶着马车，到很远的牧场上去运肥料；有的排成长长的行列，袒露着胳膊，挥动着锹镐，在开垦荒地；有的头上冒着大汗，背着大筐往地里送肥。他们对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对伟大的毛泽东思想突出一个“用”字，把春耕生产的田野，变成了学习毛主席著作的大课堂。他们在耕牛的犁架顶上，插着鲜艳的红旗，两旁的红布上用藏文写着革命的根本问题是政权问题和“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。犁田手一边学习，一边耕地。
    很多平素不大走出家门的老阿妈、老大爷，都捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》来到地里，和大家一起学习，一起参加劳动。他们说：有了伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们就能够战胜一切困难，从胜利走向胜利。
    位于喜马拉雅山主脉“神女”峰下的帕里，拔海四千三百米，地势高寒，气候多变，绝对无霜期平均一年只有三十几天。
    一九六七年，是帕里人民在喜马拉雅山台地大面积试种庄稼的第七个年头。经过他们的辛勤劳动，新开垦的五千多克（一克约合一亩）土地上庄稼越长越旺。可是，就在青稞扬花灌浆的节骨眼上，天气突变，冷霜袭来，严重地威胁着农作物的生长。在降落大霜的夜晚，全镇男女老少一齐出动，奔向田野，把设置在田边地头的二三百个防霜烟塔点燃起来，让它们冒出浓烟抵抗大霜。在连续五次同酷霜的激烈搏斗中，有的人被浓烟熏得头昏眼肿，有的人累得腰痠腿痛，但是没有一个人离开战斗岗位。
    一天夜里，由于气温急剧下降，突然下了一场罕见的大雪，青稞穗都冻成了冰凌，大雪压断了禾秆。面对这样的大雪灾，他们并没有灰心。经过半个多月的艰苦奋斗，终于夺回了近二十万斤粮食。
    在生产受到挫折的情况下，有一部分人认为，帕里是被列为大寨式的先进典型单位，收的粮食这样少，有点抬不起头来。有个别人还担心来年会不会再遇到同样的灾害。这时，由边防战士组成的毛泽东思想宣传队来到了帕里。他们和翻身农民同吃、同住、同劳动，一起学习毛主席的光辉著作，向群众宣传毛主席的最新指示。
    在战士们的帮助下，群众学习了毛主席的最新指示和关于艰苦奋斗、奋发图强的论述。毛主席教导说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”毛主席的指示，解开了一些人思想上的疙瘩，给了他们巨大的鼓舞和无穷的力量。广大翻身农民说：我们不能光有大寨之名，没有大寨人的精神。他们决心发扬大寨精神，自力更生，克服困难，去争取新的胜利。
    在边防战士的大力帮助下，帕里办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。藏族翻身农民们以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老五篇”和毛主席的最新指示为武器，在灵魂深处闹革命，促进了思想革命化。他们决心为革命种好田，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅一切，争取把去年因霜灾、雪灾丢掉的粮食，在新的一年中全部夺回来。很多贫苦农民坚决表示，在生产上遇到困难时，决不能向国家伸手，必须发扬大寨的自力更生精神，靠自己来解决。他们遵循毛主席“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生”的教导，决定进山打柴，弥补农业的歉收。他们组成了一百六十多人的伐木队，冒着风雪，进入深山密林，伐木劈柴，苦战一个月，砍了数十万斤柴禾，出售给国家，收入一万一千多元，不但解决了生产种子问题，而且还解决了困难户的生活问题。
    种子问题刚刚解决，在播种面积问题上又引起了争论。有人主张今年播种面积要尽量减少，先提高单位面积产量就行啦；也有人认为，在提高单位面积产量的同时，要大力扩大播种面积。在这种情况下，边防战士们又帮助大家学习毛主席关于全心全意为人民服务和自力更生、艰苦奋斗的教导。毛主席说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”毛主席的教导，激励着广大翻身农民。许多翻身农民想起在旧社会受的牛马不如的苦，想到在毛主席领导下的新社会的甜，他们浑身是劲，决定扩大播种面积，掀起了一个“向荒原要粮”的群众性运动。人们在寒风凛冽的田野上，冒着零下三十多度的酷寒，挥镐舞锹，开垦了三百多克地，使粮食作物的播种面积增加到了六千多克。
    地多了，需要的肥料也多了。被群众称为“生产闯将”的平措和大娃，为了给集体找肥源，在半夜里就起来，带着红彤彤的革命宝书，骑着马，翻大山，走长路，到很远的地方去寻找肥料。路上，脚被冻麻木了，耳朵也被冻肿了。可是，他一想起毛主席“关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重”的教导，心里就暖烘烘的，浑身增添了无穷的力量。在茫茫的雪原上，他一连找了几处，终于在五十多里外的地方找到了肥源，并连夜组织人力，赶着十九辆马车和七十多头驮畜，往回运肥料。那是一个风雪交加的夜晚，寒风吹在脸上，就象尖刀刺肉一样疼痛。翻身农民们背靠背地挤在一起，一遍又一遍地背诵毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”大家斗志昂扬，意气风发，经过夜以继日的艰苦奋战，终于运回来了大批肥料。
    为了夺取农业大丰收，帕里人民还破除迷信，对严重危害农作物的地老鼠展开了歼灭战。在半个多月当中，帕里出动了一千二百多人次，灭鼠面积达六百多克。这是历史上从来没有过的事。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席说：“我们要让亿万人民掌握毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，用毛泽东思想来改变整个社会的精神面貌，让毛泽东思想这个伟大的精神力量，变成伟大的物质力量！”英雄的帕里人民，正在掌握毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，因而使革命和生产从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，让“世界屋脊”上的大寨这面红旗在喜马拉雅山上高高飘扬！
