A truck slowly drove into the factory. Upon hearing that this was the car from a certain art school's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team that had broken down, we immediately stated: We must not let the propaganda team delay in promoting Mao Zedong Thought; we must fix it as quickly as possible so that they can promote Chairman Mao's voice as soon as possible. Before the work order was issued, everyone started fixing it.

The comrades from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team used their holidays to come here and perform for the broad masses of workers. They seized every opportunity and used as much time as possible to perform and promote, not even letting these short tens of minutes of waiting for repairs go to waste. They forgot the fatigue of continuous performances, went deep into the workshops, and performed to comfort the workers who were insisting on production. The propaganda team comrades sang one song after another, performed one piece after another, and even wanted to perform a ballet for the workers. The old workers saw that the workshop floor was hard and uneven, fearing that it would hurt the team members' feet, and all affectionately tried to stop them. However, the comrades from the propaganda team, with a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and with deep class feelings for the worker comrades, disregarded the difficulties of the uneven ground, and insisted on performing excerpts from the ballet "White-Haired Girl" and other items for the workers.

This performance was warmly welcomed by the workers. Many old workers were deeply moved and said: The bourgeois "artists" see us workers in our greasy clothes and avoid us; you perform ballet for the workers right by the machines in the workshop, what a stark contrast! Today, Chairman Mao's cultural warriors bring the program to our workshop, this is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao! We must do a good job in the great criticism, do a good job in the reform of our unit, grasp the revolution, and vigorously promote production, and strive for double victories in revolution and production.

Through performing for the workers, the comrades from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team also received great education and further understood the great significance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. They said: "In the past, because of the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists like the Chinese Khrushchev and Zhou Yang who controlled the power in the literary and artistic circles, they promoted a completely bourgeois line. We must deeply carry out the great criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev, and thoroughly eliminate the poison he spread in the literary and artistic field and all other fields, and let Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line occupy all positions. We must forever follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, make use of every opportunity to promote Mao Zedong Thought, and wholeheartedly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers."

    利用一切机会宣传毛泽东思想
    一辆卡车徐徐驶进了工厂。一听说这是某艺术学校毛泽东思想宣传队的汽车出了毛病，我们当即表示：决不能让宣传队耽误宣传毛泽东思想，一定尽快地修好，使他们能尽早地宣传毛主席的声音。没等派工单下达，大家就动手修起来。
    毛泽东思想宣传队的同志们，利用假日，来我们这里为广大工人演出。他们争取一切机会，利用尽可能多的时间进行演出宣传，连这等候修车的短短几十分钟，也不白白放过。他们忘掉连续演出的疲劳，深入车间，为坚持生产的工人进行慰问演出。宣传队的同志们拉了一曲又一曲，唱了一支又一支，还要为工人演出芭蕾舞剧。老工人们看见车间的地又硬又不平，怕伤了队员们的脚，都挚情地去劝阻。但是宣传队的同志们，怀着一颗对伟大领袖毛主席的忠心，怀着对工人同志的深厚的阶级感情，不顾场地不平的困难，坚持为工人演出了芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的片断和其他节目。
    这场演出，受到工人的热烈欢迎。很多老工人深为感动地说：资产阶级的“艺术家”见了我们穿油泥衣服的工人，都躲着走；你们在车间机床旁边为工人演出芭蕾舞剧，真是鲜明的对比！今天毛主席的文艺战士把节目送到我们车间里来，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。这是托毛主席他老人家的福啊！我们一定要搞好革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，狠抓革命，猛促生产，誓夺革命、生产双胜利。
      通过为工人演出，毛泽东思想宣传队的同志也受到很大教育，进一步体会到毛主席文艺路线的伟大意义。他们说：“过去由于中国的赫鲁晓夫和周扬等一小撮反革命修正主义分子把持了文艺界大权，他们推行的完全是资产阶级的一套，我们必须深入地开展对中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判，肃清他在文艺方面以及一切方面所散布的流毒，让毛主席的文艺路线占领一切阵地。我们要永远按照毛主席指引的方向前进，利用一切机会宣传毛泽东思想，全心全意地为工农兵服务。”
