The storm of revolutionary mass movements in Europe and North America has swept into Yugoslavia, which is under the rule of the Tito renegade clique. This has caused the Soviet revisionist clique, which is the center of modern revisionism, to panic. They have once again jumped out to collude with the Tito renegade clique, viciously slandering the heroic struggle of Yugoslav students.

Since Yugoslav students began their fierce demonstrations against the revisionist educational system on June 2, the Soviet revisionist clique initially remained silent. When the struggle entered its third day and the flames of the fight burned more intensely, the Soviet clique could no longer contain their panic and jumped out, colluding with the Tito renegade clique to slander the just struggle of Yugoslav students. On June 4, they used their propaganda mouthpieces—*Pravda*, Tass, and other Soviet revisionist publications—to viciously curse the students who initiated this struggle as "irresponsible elements," and their struggle as "disturbances." The Soviet revisionists also maliciously claimed that this struggle "led to" the "destruction of public safety and material losses to residents," and "led to the disruption of urban social order," blatantly revealing their ugly faces of maintaining the old capitalist order.

The facts show that wherever revolutionary mass movements occur that shake or challenge the capitalist reactionary "order," the Soviet revisionist clique colludes with the reactionary ruling authorities there to create counter-revolutionary public opinion, helping the reactionary ruling authorities suppress the people's revolutionary struggles. A month ago, they viciously accused the anti-violence struggle of black people in the United States of destroying the "order supporting civilized society" in the United States. Recently, these renegades eagerly jumped out again, shouting at the top of their lungs to slander the just struggle of French workers and students as "riots" and "rebellious actions."

The great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "The peoples of all countries, more than 90 percent of the total population, are always revolutionary and will always support Marxism-Leninism. They will not support revisionism; some may temporarily support it, but they will eventually abandon it. They will gradually awaken and will oppose imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries, and will oppose revisionism." No tricks of the Soviet revisionist clique can stop the development of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. On the contrary, they will only make the peoples of the world see more clearly the counter-revolutionary true face of this gang of renegades, promote their revolutionary awakening, and thus accelerate the downfall of the Soviet revisionist clique.

    那里出现革命群众运动  苏修就向那里发出反革命嚎叫
    苏修领导紧紧配合铁托叛徒集团  疯狂诋毁南斯拉夫学生英勇斗争
    据新华社六日讯　欧洲、北美的革命群众运动的风暴刮到了铁托叛徒集团统治的南斯拉夫，这使作为现代修正主义统治中心的苏修叛徒集团十分恐慌不安。他们又一次跳出来配合铁托叛徒集团，疯狂诋毁南斯拉夫学生的英勇斗争。
    自从南斯拉夫学生六月二日开始举行猛烈冲击修正主义教育制度的示威游行以来，苏修叛徒集团起初默不作声；当这场斗争进行到第三天，斗争烈火越烧越旺时，苏修集团终于按捺不住内心的恐慌，跳了出来，配合铁托叛徒集团大肆诽谤南斯拉夫学生的正义斗争。六月四日，他们通过自己的宣传喉舌——《真理报》、塔斯社和苏修其它报刊，恶毒咒骂掀起这场斗争的南斯拉夫学生是什么“不负责任的分子”，他们的斗争是什么“骚动”。苏修还胡说什么这场斗争“导致了”“公民安全的破坏和给居民造成了物质损失”，“导致了城市社会秩序的破坏”等等，赤裸裸地暴露了一副维护资本主义旧秩序的丑恶嘴脸。
    事实表明，那里发生了动摇或冲击资本主义反动“秩序”的革命群众运动，苏修叛徒集团就伙同那里的反动统治当局大造反革命舆论，帮助反动统治当局镇压人民的革命斗争。一个月以前，他们恶狠狠地指责美国黑人的抗暴斗争破坏了美国“支持着文明社会的秩序”。最近，这伙叛徒们又迫不及待地跳出来声嘶力竭地把法国工人和学生的正义斗争污蔑为什么“骚乱”、“叛乱行动”。
    无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席指出：“各国的人民，占人口总数的百分之九十以上的人民大众，总是要革命的，总是会拥护马克思列宁主义的。他们不会拥护修正主义，有些人暂时拥护，将来终究会抛弃它。他们总会逐步地觉醒起来，总会反对帝国主义和各国的反动派，总会反对修正主义。”苏修叛徒集团的任何阴谋伎俩，绝对阻挡不了各国人民革命斗争的发展，相反，只会使世界人民越来越清楚地识破这伙叛徒的反革命真面目，促进他们的革命觉醒，从而使苏修集团加速走向灭亡。
