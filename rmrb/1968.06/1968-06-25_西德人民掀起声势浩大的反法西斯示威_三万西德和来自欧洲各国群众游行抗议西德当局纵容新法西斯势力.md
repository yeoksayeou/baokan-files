Three hundred thousand West Germans and people from various European countries held rallies and demonstrations in Munich on the 22nd and 23rd to protest against the West German authorities' tolerance and protection of neo-fascist forces, which have been increasingly rampant.

On the 23rd, demonstrators carrying numerous red flags and banners held a massive anti-fascist demonstration and protest rally in Munich. Some who had suffered under Hitler's fascist rule also participated in the march and rally. At the rally, many speakers condemned the German National Democratic Party, pointing out that this neo-fascist party is a direct descendant of Hitler's Nazi Party. The rally adopted a resolution calling for the ban of the German National Democratic Party.

Participants in this anti-fascist activity also held a rally on the 22nd to denounce the atrocities of Hitler's fascism.

In recent times, residents of some West German cities have repeatedly held demonstrations to protest against the West German authorities' protection and tolerance of neo-fascist forces and the forced passage of the reactionary "Emergency Powers Act."

In Dortmund, a group of demonstrators held a protest in mid-June against the "Emergency Powers Act." In Coburg, three thousand people held an anti-fascist demonstration and rally on June 17th. On the same day, demonstrators in Bochum clashed violently with fascist thugs to prevent the German National Democratic Party from holding a fascist rally.

The people of West Germany and various European countries still vividly remember the barbaric atrocities of Hitler's fascism. They resolutely oppose the neo-fascist forces in West Germany, under the protection of the Bonn ruling authorities, from resuming their evil activities. The image shows West Germans who have suffered under Nazi fascism, holding signs demanding democracy and freedom, protesting angrily against the reactionary "Emergency Powers Act" drafted and passed by the West German authorities.

    二十三日示威者打着无数红旗和标语牌在慕尼黑举行了声势浩大的反法西斯示威游行和抗议大会。一些曾经受过希特勒法西斯统治迫害的群众，也参加了游行和抗议大会。在大会上许多发言者纷纷谴责德国国家民主党，并且指出，这个新法西斯党和希特勒的纳粹党是一脉相承的。大会通过一项声明，要求禁止德国国家民主党。
    参加这次反法西斯活动的群众还在二十二日举行了集会，声讨希特勒法西斯的暴行。
    最近以来，西德一些城市的居民曾不断举行示威，抗议西德当局庇护、纵容新法西斯势力和强行通过反动的“紧急状态法”。
    在多特蒙德，一批示威者在六月中旬举行示威，抗议“紧急状态法”。在科堡，三千名群众在六月十七日举行了反法西斯示威和集会。同一天，波鸿市的示威群众为了阻止德国国家民主党举行法西斯集会，同法西斯党徒发生了激烈的冲突。（附图片）
    西德和欧洲各国人民对希特勒法西斯的野蛮暴行记忆犹新。他们坚决反对西德新法西斯势力在波恩统治当局的纵容下，重新进行罪恶活动。图为曾受过纳粹法西斯迫害的西德人民，拿着要求民主自由的标语牌举行示威，愤怒抗议西德反动当局制订和通过的“紧急状态法”。
