	Chairman Mao's Quotations
	The basic experience of revolutionary committees has three points: one is to have representatives of revolutionary cadres, one is to have representatives of the military, and one is to have representatives of revolutionary masses, achieving the three-in-one combination of the revolution. Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline administration and personnel, and organize a revolutionary leadership corps that is linked to the masses.
