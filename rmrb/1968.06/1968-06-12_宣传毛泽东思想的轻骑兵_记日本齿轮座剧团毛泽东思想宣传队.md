With the solemn melody of "The East Is Red," several Japanese revolutionary cultural warriors holding the red treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" turned their gazes towards the left front. With hearts full of excitement, they awaited the most blessed moment.

"Chairman Mao has arrived! Chairman Mao has arrived!"

"Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

People waved the red treasure books, cheered, and jumped...

This was the Japanese Gear Playhouse Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team performing the revolutionary cultural program "Chairman Mao, You Are the Red Sun in Our Hearts" in Japan. This program reenacted the moving scene when they were received by Chairman Mao last October in China.

Chairman Mao, You Are the Red Sun in Our Hearts

Whenever the Gear Playhouse Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team performs this program for the masses, they pour in the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm and the most sincere feelings to express their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. During the performance, they wipe away tears of happiness time and time again, as if they were seeing the great leader Chairman Mao once more.

The actors made solemn vows: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, receiving us is not only the greatest encouragement for the Gear Playhouse but also the greatest support and encouragement for the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people."

"Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, no matter how great the difficulties we encounter in the future, we will always follow you forward."

"Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, you are the reddest red sun in our hearts. We firmly believe that as long as we follow you forward, a new Japan of the people will definitely appear in the East."

The vows made by the actors to Chairman Mao expressed the voices and resolve of the Japanese revolutionary people. The audience was also moved to tears, unable to contain their emotions, and enthusiastically cheered along with the actors: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand ten thousand years! Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!"

At the end of the performance, many audience members, without wiping away their tears, rushed forward to shake hands with the actors, wanting to share the greatest happiness of being received by Chairman Mao. Some audience members said, "I am so eager to see the great leader Chairman Mao!"

Only the combination of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Japanese revolutionary practice can save Japan

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, greatly inspired the revolutionary cultural warriors of the Gear Playhouse. Through their anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle practices, they drew a conclusion: only the combination of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Japanese revolutionary practice can save Japan.

A member of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team said: "Last year, after visiting China for four months, we returned to Japan. We deeply felt that as revolutionary cultural warriors of the Mao Zedong era, we must not only study Mao Zedong Thought well ourselves but also promote Mao Zedong Thought to the people."

In January of this year, the revolutionary cultural warriors of the Gear Playhouse organized three Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams. They brought with them carefully created cultural programs and traversed mountains and rivers, performing in 23 prefectures from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the south. In less than five months, they performed for over 20,000 audience members.

The Gear Playhouse Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team went deep into factories, rural areas, and streets, performing enthusiastically for the masses and promoting Mao Zedong Thought, whether it was by the fields, in the workshops, on the rooftops of buildings, or on the platforms of train stations.

On a day in March in the northeastern part of Japan, it was still winter. On one afternoon in March, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team arrived at a train station in Sendai's Toshimachi. At that time, it was snowing and windy, with the cold wind piercing through. However, the revolutionary cultural warriors of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team saw many passengers, as well as drivers and attendants resting at the station. They seized this opportunity, had the crowd sit in the waiting room, and went outside to perform many wonderful revolutionary cultural programs in the cold and snow, much to the audience's delight.

Several construction workers nearby heard the news and hurried over. However, by the time they arrived, the performance had ended, and they felt very regretful. The cultural warriors of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, following Chairman Mao's teachings of completely and thoroughly serving the people, did not fear fatigue and specially performed an additional show for the workers.

Once, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team held a discussion with local residents in a park in Toyama Prefecture. After the discussion, they sang revolutionary songs together. The powerful and vigorous singing attracted many people. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team decided to perform for the crowd. During the performance of the dance "People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America Want Liberation," they lacked a large drum for accompaniment. A team member quickly found a round iron bucket in the park to use as a drum, adding a strong fighting atmosphere to the performance. When the actors portraying the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America held up the red treasure book, accompanied by the stirring drumbeats, and performed the actions of smashing shackles and fighting for liberation, the inspired crowd cheered. An old man in the audience could not help but say to the people around him, "The red book in their hands contains the words of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao teaches us to unite and fight against the reactionaries."

Let Mao Zedong Thought Penetrate the Hearts of the People

The revolutionary cultural warriors of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team are determined to forever be good students of Chairman Mao. They carry with them the revolutionary treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," insist on studying every day, and pay attention to applying what they learn.

Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is their guide to action.

Once, they performed in a city in the San'in region, coinciding with the workers' strike there. They supported the workers' struggle in action and quickly rehearsed a short play reflecting this struggle, performing it for the workers the next day, which was highly praised by the workers and greatly boosted their morale.

The cultural warriors of the Gear Playhouse Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, wherever they go, bring some of Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao badges to give to the Japanese revolutionary people who love Chairman Mao. Every time they arrive at a place to stay, they insist on holding discussions with the people, enthusiastically promoting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and Mao Zedong Thought. Sometimes, the discussions continue until late at night.

These vanguards of promoting Mao Zedong Thought do not fear hardship or fatigue. Each propaganda team consists of only six people, and an actor has to play several roles in a single performance, which is quite demanding. However, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "carrying forward the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and fighting continuously (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)," they are full of revolutionary optimism and never complain. Some workers, deeply moved, said to them, "No theater has ever come down to perform for us workers. But you have come to our midst." One worker, with tears in his eyes after watching the performance, said excitedly, "Your revolutionary spirit has moved me. You are able to perform so well because you have armed your minds with Chairman Mao's 'Three Articles.' We must also resolutely follow the revolutionary path pointed out by Chairman Mao." He shouted, "Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!"

Once, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team performed for port workers in Osaka. When they performed the scene of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America uniting to resist the evil imperialists and seizing guns from the Americans, the workers could not contain their excitement, enthusiastically applauded, and shouted, "Excellent! Wonderful! We must do it this way!"

After watching the performance by the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, farmers in Yamaguchi Prefecture's Miyoshi said, "Your performance has given us courage. We will also use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight." Farmers in Chiba Prefecture's Sanrizuka, who were bravely fighting against the new military airfield built by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, firmly declared after watching the performance that they would continue their struggle to the end until they achieve final victory.

A member of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, talking about his experience in propaganda activities, said, "Our entire life, our every word and deed, must serve to promote Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, we must study Mao Zedong Thought even more diligently in the future, so that every action of ours can be in line with Mao Zedong Thought."

Currently, this vanguard of promoting Mao Zedong Thought is continuing to fight amidst the great winds and waves in stormy Japan.

    宣传毛泽东思想的轻骑兵
    ——记日本齿轮座剧团毛泽东思想宣传队
    随着庄严的《东方红》乐曲声，舞台上几位手捧红色宝书《毛主席语录》的日本革命文艺战士，把目光一齐投向左前方。他们怀着一颗激动的红心，等待着最最幸福的时刻的到来。
    “毛主席来了！”“毛主席来了！”
    “伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    人们挥动着红色宝书，欢呼着，跳跃着……。
    这是日本齿轮座剧团毛泽东思想宣传队在日本演出的革命文艺节目《毛主席，您是我们心中的红太阳》。这个节目再现了他们去年十月在中国受到毛主席接见时的动人情景。
    毛主席，您是我们心中的红太阳
    齿轮座剧团的毛泽东思想宣传队，每当向群众演出这个节目时，都倾注着最大的革命热情，以最真挚的感情，表现出对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。在演出过程中，他们一次又一次地拭去幸福的泪花，仿佛又见到了伟大领袖毛主席。
    演员们发出了庄严的誓言：“毛主席啊，毛主席，您接见我们，这不仅是对我们齿轮座剧团的最大鼓舞，而且是对日本人民革命斗争的最大支持和最大鼓舞。”
    “毛主席啊，毛主席，今后不管遇到多么大的困难，我们都永远跟着您前进。”
    “毛主席啊，毛主席，您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。我们深信，只要跟着您老人家前进，人民的新日本，就一定会出现在世界的东方。”
    演员们向毛主席发出的誓言，道出了日本革命人民的心声和决心。观众也被感动得热泪盈眶，情不自禁地跟演员们一道热情地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“祝福毛主席万寿无疆！”
    剧终时，许多观众顾不上擦干眼泪，拥上前去，紧握演员的手，要同他们分享毛主席接见的最大的幸福。有的观众说，“我多么渴望见到伟大领袖毛主席啊！”
    只有马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想与日本革命实践相结合，才能救日本
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，大大地鼓舞了齿轮座剧团的革命文艺战士。他们通过反帝反修的斗争实践，得出了一个结论：只有马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想与日本革命实践相结合，才能救日本。
    毛泽东思想宣传队的一位队员说：“去年我们在中国访问了四个月后，回到了日本。我们深切地感到，作为毛泽东时代的革命文艺战士，不仅自己要学好毛泽东思想，而且还要向人民群众宣传好毛泽东思想。”
    今年一月份，齿轮座剧团的革命文艺战士，组织了三个毛泽东思想宣传队，他们带着精心创作的十几个文艺节目，跋山涉水，在日本北起北海道，南至九州的二十三个都道府县为群众演出。在不到五个月的时间里，观众达两万人次左右。
    齿轮座剧团的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入工矿、农村和街道，不管是在田边、车间，还是在楼房的平台和车站的月台上，他们都热情地为群众演出，向群众宣传。
    三月的日本东北地方，还是隆冬季节。今年三月的一天下午，毛泽东思想宣传队来到仙台登米町的一个火车站。当时，风雪交加，寒风刺骨。但是毛泽东思想宣传队的革命文艺战士，看到车站上有很多乘客，还有正在休息的司机和乘务员。他们便抓住了这个机会，让群众坐在候车室里，自己到外面，冒着严寒和风雪，表演了许多精彩的革命文艺节目，深受观众的欢迎。
    正在附近劳动的七、八个建筑工人听到消息，也急忙跑来。但是，等到他们赶来时，演出已经结束了，他们感到非常惋惜。毛泽东思想宣传队的文艺战士们，根据毛主席完全彻底为人民服务的教导，不怕疲劳，又特地为工人们加演了一场。
    毛泽东思想宣传队的文艺战士，有一次在富山县同当地的群众在公园里举行座谈会。会后，他们一道唱起了革命歌曲。一阵阵雄壮有力的歌声，吸引了很多群众。毛泽东思想宣传队临时决定要为群众演出一场。他们在表演《亚非拉人民要解放》的舞蹈时，缺少一个伴奏用的大鼓。剧团的一个团员急中生智，在公园里找到一个圆铁桶，用来伴奏，给这场演出增加了强烈的战斗气氛。当扮演亚非拉人民的演员们高举红色宝书，伴随着激动人心的鼓声，雄赳赳气昂昂地表演砸烂羁绊、争取解放的动作时，受到鼓舞的群众，一片欢腾。观众里有一位老大爷情不自禁地向周围的群众说：“他们手里的那本红书，写着毛主席的话，毛主席教导我们团结起来，向反动派进行斗争。”
    让毛泽东思想深入人心
    毛泽东思想宣传队的革命文艺战士，立志永远做毛主席的好学生。他们随身携带着革命宝书《毛主席语录》，坚持每天学习，并且注意活学活用。
    毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，是他们的行动指南。
    有一次，他们到山阴地方的一个城市演出，正赶上那里的工人举行罢工斗争。他们就一面用实际行动支持工人们的斗争，一面连夜编排反映这一斗争的短剧，第二天就给工人演出，深受工人们的赞扬，并大大地鼓舞了他们的斗志。
    齿轮座剧团毛泽东思想宣传队的文艺战士，无论走到哪里，都带上一些毛主席著作和毛主席像章，赠送给热爱毛主席的日本革命人民。他们每到一个地方落脚，都坚持同群众举行座谈会，向群众热情地宣传中国无产阶级文化大革命，宣传毛泽东思想，有时座谈会一直开到深夜。
    这些宣传毛泽东思想的轻骑兵，不怕苦，不怕累，每个宣传队只由六个人组成，一个演员在一次演出中，要扮演几个角色，相当紧张。但是，他们根据毛主席“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”的教导，充满着革命乐观主义的精神，从不叫苦。一些工人深受感动地对他们说：“过去从来没有一个剧团下来给咱们工人演出过。但是，你们来到了我们中间。”有一位工人看完演出后，眼里噙着泪花，激动地说：“你们的革命精神，使我感动。你们所以能演得这样好，是由于你们用毛主席的‘老三篇’武装头脑的结果。我们也要坚决走毛主席指出的革命道路。”他高呼：“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    有一次，毛泽东思想宣传队在大阪为港湾工人演出，当演到亚非拉人民团结起来，反抗万恶的殖民主义者，从美国佬手中夺过枪的情景时，工人们抑制不住内心的激动，热情鼓掌，并欢呼：“好极了，痛快极了！”“我们就是要这样干！”
    山口县弥富的农民在看了毛泽东思想宣传队的演出后说：“你们的演出，给我们增加了勇气。我们也要用毛泽东思想作武器进行斗争。”正在为反对美日反动派新建军用机场而英勇斗争的千叶县三里塚的农民看了演出后坚定地表示，一定要把他们的斗争进行到底，直到取得最后胜利。
    毛泽东思想宣传队的一个队员在谈到他参加宣传活动的体会时说，“我们的整个生活，我们的一言一行，都要为宣传毛泽东思想服务。因此，我们今后要更加努力学习毛泽东思想，使我们的每一个行动，都能够做到符合毛泽东思想。”
    目前，这支宣传毛泽东思想的轻骑兵，正迎着大风大浪，在风雷激荡的日本，继续战斗着。
