Paris (June 21, Xinhua) - Workers in many industries in France continue to break through various obstacles and persist in their strike struggles. Progressive students and middle school students bravely stand up for justice despite brutal suppression.

Workers in the automobile, metallurgy, and electronics industries, as well as employees of the French National Broadcasting and Television, have defied threats and inducements from the French ruling class and, as of June 20, are still steadfastly continuing their strike struggles. In some enterprises where workers had returned to work due to the betrayal of labor traitors, workers remain spirited. Shortly after resuming work, they quickly went on strike again, dealing a new blow to the monopoly capitalists.

In the automobile industry, which was the first to go on strike, tens of thousands of workers at the Citroën automobile factories and the Saviem heavy truck factory in the Paris suburbs have resolutely withstood the betrayal policies of the French Communist Party-led General Confederation of Labor and other yellow unions, foiling the capitalists' plot to lure workers back to work. In addition, 16,000 workers in the electronics industry and workers in the metallurgy departments of Nord, Rhône, and Paris, as well as workers in other enterprises, are still continuing their strikes.

The strike by more than 12,000 employees of the French National Broadcasting and Television entered its 33rd day on June 20. The striking employees resolutely oppose the French government's strict control over the broadcasting and television station, keeping this important propaganda tool of the French ruling class in a state of paralysis.

Despite the use of various means by the French ruling class to lure striking workers back to work, their plots are being exposed by more and more workers. Many workers who had returned to work recently went on strike again, leaving the French ruling authorities at a loss. On June 20, 1,000 workers at the Maluzen lathe factory in central Vichy went on strike again because the management refused to fulfill the demands they had agreed to after the workers returned to work. They also occupied the factory. Workers at the Renault automobile factory in Flins, who had returned to work on June 18, went on strike for 12 hours the next day; 1,600 workers at the Oual agricultural machinery factory in the Loire-Atlantique department also went on strike again after returning to work on June 18.

In the French ruling class's plot to lure workers back to work, the General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the French Communist Party, has become a shameful tool of the French ruling class. To sabotage the strike struggle of workers at the Renault automobile factories, the leaders of the General Confederation of Labor openly called for a return to work, claiming that the conditions for returning to work were "satisfactory" and urging workers to return to work quickly. After the workers at the Renault factory in Flins went on strike again on June 19, the General Confederation of Labor even attacked the strike as an "adventurous action" instigated by "irresponsible people," blatantly sabotaging the strike. The treacherous actions of the French Communist Party have infuriated more and more workers, making them see through the traitorous and labor traitor faces of the French Communist Party.

While French workers persist in their strike struggles, progressive students in France fearlessly and tenaciously continue their struggles despite the savage suppression of the French ruling class. Not only do university students persist in occupying schools, but middle school students in Paris also occupied many schools on June 20 to oppose the resumption of classes and support the struggles of university students. Although teachers have returned to teach in many middle schools, classes cannot resume due to student strikes.

Rome (June 21, Xinhua) - The struggles of Italian workers and students continue to surge. On June 20, 60,000 construction workers in Rome went on strike and held street demonstrations, demanding wage increases, full employment, and production safety guarantees.

Due to the capitalists' intensified exploitation of workers, construction accidents are rampant. In the first five months of this year, 28 construction workers in the Italian capital died in accidents, and thousands of construction workers were injured. This dire situation has enraged the workers.

Several thousand electrical and mechanical workers at the Italian subsidiary of the U.S. General Electric Company also held demonstrations in Milan on the same day, protesting against the layoff of workers. The slogans carried by the workers read: "The more we produce, the more American capitalists lay off workers."

When the demonstration passed by the dean's office of the National University, which had been occupied by students, the students came out to welcome the workers warmly.

Students in Rome held a massive demonstration on June 20, protesting the dean's rejection of their demand for direct management of the "Student House" by the student union. This demonstration was also in support of workers who had been on strike for four days at the "Student House." Students set up barricades to resist the police's encirclement, and traffic on the streets outside the building was temporarily halted. Students also burned a car in the middle of the street.

Progressive students in Lyon, France's second-largest city, fearlessly set up barricades in the streets, ready to resist the savage suppression of reactionary police at any time.

    法国工人决心顶住黑风斗争到底
    一些由于工贼叛卖而复工的工人在识破法修阴谋后继续罢工
    意大利首都六万建筑工人大罢工反对垄断资本剥削
    据新华社二十一日讯　巴黎消息：法国许多行业的工人，继续冲破重重阻挠，把罢工斗争坚持下去。进步的大、中学生不畏强暴，坚持正义斗争。
    法国汽车、冶金、电子等企业中的部分工人和法国国家广播电视台的职工，蔑视法国统治集团的威胁利诱，到二十日为止仍在顽强地坚持罢工斗争。在一些由于工贼的叛卖而导致复工的企业中，工人依然斗志昂扬，他们在工厂复工后不久很快地又举行了罢工，给予垄断资产阶级以新的打击。
    在最先罢工的汽车工业中，雪铁龙汽车公司各工厂和巴黎郊区萨维昂重型卡车工厂的几万名工人，坚决顶住法修总工会和其他黄色工会的叛卖政策，使资本家诱骗工人复工的阴谋归于破产。此外，目前继续坚持罢工的还有一万六千名电子工业部门的工人以及诺尔省、罗纳省和巴黎地区的冶金部门的工人和其他一些企业的工人。
    法国国家广播电视台一万二千多名职工的罢工斗争二十日进入第三十三天，罢工的职工坚决反对法国政府对广播电视台的严密控制，使法国统治集团的这个重要宣传工具继续处于瘫痪。
    尽管法国统治集团使用各种手段诱骗罢工工人复工，但是，他们的阴谋正在被越来越多的工人所识破。许多已经复工的工人，最近再次举行罢工斗争，使法国统治当局穷于应付。二十日，中部维希的马律南车床厂的一千名工人，因为资方在工人复工后拒绝执行已答应工人的要求，二十日再次举行罢工，并且占领了工厂。在弗兰的雷诺汽车工厂的工人，十八日复工后十九日又罢工十二小时；罗亚尔—大西洋省的乌阿尔农业机械厂的一千六百名工人复工后十八日也再次举行罢工。
    在法国统治集团诱骗工人复工的阴谋中，法修控制的总工会充当了法国统治集团的可耻的工具。为了破坏雷诺汽车公司各工厂的工人罢工斗争，总工会头目们公然跳出来叫嚷复工条件“是满意的”，要工人赶快复工。雷诺的弗兰厂的工人十九日再次罢工后，总工会竟攻击罢工是“不负责任的人”挑起的“冒险行动”，明目张胆地破坏了这次罢工。法修的叛卖行径激起了越来越多的工人的愤怒，使他们认清了法修的叛徒和工贼面目。
    在法国工人坚持罢工斗争的同时，法国进步学生不怕法国统治集团的野蛮镇压，继续英勇顽强地坚持斗争。不仅大学生坚持占领学校，巴黎的中学生二十日也占领了许多学校，反对复课，以支持大学生的斗争。许多中学虽然教师复教了，但是由于学生罢课，仍然无法复课。
    新华社二十一日讯　罗马消息：意大利工人和学生的斗争继续风起云涌。罗马六万建筑工人二十日举行罢工并上街游行示威，要求增加工资、要求充分就业和保障生产安全。
    由于资本家变本加厉地对工人实行剥削，建筑工人的工伤事故层出不穷。在今年头五个月中，意大利首都有二十八名建筑工人因事故死亡，数以千计的建筑工人受伤。这种恶劣状况激起了工人们的愤怒。
    属于美国通用电气公司在意大利分公司工厂的几千名电气、机械工人同一天在米兰举行游行示威，反对解雇工人。工人们抬着的标语牌上写着：“我们的产量越增加，美国资本
  （家）解雇工人就越多”。
    当游行队伍经过被学生占领的国立大学校长办公室外面时，学生们出来向工人表示热烈欢迎。
    罗马学生二十日举行声势浩大的游行示威，抗议校长拒绝他们所提出的关于由学生会直接管理“学生之家”的要求。这次示威也是为了声援已经坚持罢工四天的在“学生之家”工作的工人。学生们筑起街垒对付警察的包围，大楼外面街上的交通曾一度中断。学生在街道中心还烧毁了一辆汽车。（附图片）
    法国第二大城市里昂的进步学生不畏强暴，在街头筑起街垒，准备随时抗击反动警察的野蛮镇压。
