The propaganda team of a certain unit stationed at the Tianjin Balance Instrument Factory has repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "never forgetting class struggle." This has enabled the members of the Revolutionary Committee to always keep a close eye on the new developments in class struggle. "What are the class enemies doing now?" Deputy Director Lao Jiao of the Revolutionary Committee took this question to the workshops and teams for investigation and research.

Lao Jiao walked into the lathe group. As soon as the workers saw him, they all gathered around him enthusiastically, chattering away, telling him that in the past few days, the number of defective products in the group had suddenly increased and that the problem needed to be addressed urgently.

"Why are there so many defective products?" Lao Jiao asked. One worker said, "We haven't found the cause yet, but Deng Xixi has been saying everywhere: 'A new hand has come, and so many defective products are produced. It's really hard to master the technology!'" Another worker said, "Don't listen to his nonsense! He used to be a capitalist. Although a 'new hand' has just been transferred from the carpentry group, after studying, he quickly mastered the operating techniques. Moreover, this new hand works quite carefully and meticulously and would not produce so many defective products!" At this point, Lao Jiao invited the newly transferred worker and asked for his opinion. The worker said angrily, "Deng Xixi often secretly pushes difficult materials to my side. What is he up to?!"

These circumstances caught Lao Jiao's attention. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that there was something behind the defective products.

Lao Jiao walked through the entire process from start to finish and finally arrived at the inspection group, convening a meeting with the workers of the inspection group.

Lao Jiao first recited Chairman Mao's great teachings with everyone: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat. They will make their last struggles." Then he said to everyone, "We must analyze everything from the perspective of class struggle and see whether the sudden increase in defective products is a production problem or a class struggle problem." Chairman Mao's teachings shone like a brilliant sun, illuminating everyone's hearts and minds. Old Zhao, an old worker in the lathe group, said, "A few days ago, when I went to help out in the lathe group, I saw Deng Xixi always loosen the tool holder after work. Isn't he deliberately trying to make me break the lathe?"

To further confirm the crimes of the reactionary capitalist Deng Xixi, it was decided to immediately go to the site to inspect the day's products.

Everyone came to the lathe group. Deng Xixi raised his eyelids and saw that there were many people, so he pretended to wipe his forehead with his arm, then put on a worried expression, and said sourly, "Has the cause of the defective products not been found yet? Seeing the state property being wasted, it really hurts!" "Hmph! Your performance is over!" The workers rebuked the reactionary capitalist while carefully inspecting the products. The inspection results showed that out of the more than a hundred lathes turned by the new hand transferred from the carpentry group, only a few had slightly poor quality, which could still be remedied in the next process; while out of the ninety-seven lathes turned by Deng Xixi, thirty-six were defective. The truth was revealed, and the class enemy's plot was exposed. Faced with the ironclad facts, the reactionary capitalist had to admit his guilt and confess that he took advantage of the opportunity to add new workers to sabotage production, attempting to shift the focus of struggle and obstruct the deepening of the struggle against the enemy.

    依靠群众找原因
    北空新
    天津衡器厂驻厂部队某部毛泽东思想宣传队，帮助革委会的委员们反复学习了毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，使革委会同志们始终密切地注视着阶级斗争的新动向。“现在阶级敌人在干些什么？”革委会副主任老焦，带着这个问题深入车间、班组，进行调查研究。
    老焦走进车砣组，工人们一见到他，都亲热地围上来，七嘴八舌地告诉他，这几天组里的废品突然大量增加，要抓紧解决。
      “废品为嘛多起来了？”老焦问。一个工人说：“我们还没找出原因来，可是，邓××却到处说：‘来了一个新手就出这么多废品，掌握技术真不易呀！’”另一个工人说：别听他胡说！他原来是资本家。虽然刚从木工组调来一个“新手”，但经过学习，很快掌握了操作要领。再说，这个新手干活还比较认真、细心，决不会出那么多废品！这时，老焦把新调来的工人请来，征求他的意见。这个工人气冲冲地说：“邓××经常偷偷摸摸地把难车的材料推到我这边来，他到底安的是嘛心？！”这些情况，引起了老焦的注意，他越想越觉得废品背后大有文章。
    老焦沿着工序从头到尾走了一趟，最后来到检验组，召集检验组工人开
  “诸葛亮会”。老焦首先和同志们齐声朗读毛主席的伟大教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”然后对大家说：“咱们要用阶级斗争的观点分析一切，看一看这废品突然增多，究竟是生产问题还是阶级斗争问题。”毛主席的教导，象一轮金光灿烂的朝阳，照得大家心明眼亮。对砣组老工人老赵说：“前些日子，我到车砣组帮忙的时候，看到邓××每次下班总是把刀架放松，这不是有意让我把砣车坏吗！”为了进一步证实反动资本家邓××的罪行，决定马上到现场检验当天的产品。
    大家来到车砣组，邓××撩起眼皮一看，来的人不少，便装模作样地用手臂在额上抹了一下，接着又装出一副焦虑的神情，酸溜溜地说：“废品多的原因还没找到吗？看到国家财产白白浪费了，咱真心疼哪！”“哼！你的表演该结束啦！”工人们一边怒斥反动资本家，一边仔细检验产品。检验的结果，从木工组调来的新手车的一百多个砣，只有个别的质量稍差，在下道工序还可以补救；而邓××车的九十七个砣里就有三十六个是废品。真相大白，阶级敌人的阴谋败露了。在铁的事实面前，反动资本家不得不低头认罪，供认他乘添新工人的机会破坏生产，妄图转移斗争目标，阻挠对敌斗争深入发展的罪恶勾当。
