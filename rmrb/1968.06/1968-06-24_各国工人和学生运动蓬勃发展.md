Workers and students in various countries are vigorously developing their movements. Two million workers in Canada went on a large-scale strike to oppose the capitalist's ruthless exploitation. The student strike movement in Turkey has spread to more than half of the colleges and universities. More than a thousand students in the capital of Uruguay demonstrated against the dictatorial government's reactionary decrees.

BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) — According to reports from Toronto, Canada, more than 20,000 workers from various industries in Canada went on strike to demand higher wages and oppose the capitalist's ruthless exploitation.

More than 1,000 workers in the St. Lawrence shipping system went on strike on June 21, demanding an 18 percent wage increase over the next two years. The strike by the shipping workers has halted more than 300 ships on the sea and inland waterways. This is the first strike in the St. Lawrence shipping system in ten years.

The St. Lawrence waterway is a vital waterway in Canada, connecting Montreal and the Great Lakes, with heavy traffic. The strike by the waterway workers has dealt a heavy blow to the Canadian monopoly capitalists.

Workers on the canals connecting other Great Lakes also went on strike.

In other industries in Canada, such as pulp and paper, agricultural machinery, automobile manufacturing, tire manufacturing, steel smelting, and mining, more than 20,000 workers are also on strike. Most of these are workers in the industrial center of Ontario. For example, 6,000 workers at the Massey-Ferguson Company in Toronto and Brantford have been on strike since April 19. In Hamilton, more than 2,000 workers at the Canadian International Harvester Company went on strike on June 18. In Toronto, municipal workers responsible for garbage, sewage, and street maintenance are also on strike.

MELBOURNE, June 20 (Xinhua) — Three thousand shipbuilders in Australia went on a nationwide 24-hour strike on the night of June 19 to protest against some Australian shipping companies awarding shipbuilding and repair contracts to foreign shipyards. The strike has halted shipbuilding work.

Fifty workers responsible for port safety in Melbourne went on strike on June 20, demanding higher wages.

ANKARA, June 21 (Xinhua) — The student strike movement in Turkey, which has been ongoing for eleven days to demand educational reforms, is continuing to develop. The strike movement has spread to more than half of the 46 colleges and universities nationwide, with 65,000 students participating.

After five days of striking, students from Ankara University went to the Prime Minister's office on June 15 to present their demands. Other students demonstrated outside the Turkish Broadcasting Company building to protest against the station's biased reporting of the student strike movement.

In addition, students in another major city in Turkey, Istanbul, occupied several major universities on June 12 and then occupied a technical university on June 17. Students from the Fine Arts Academy and the Florence Nightingale Nursing School in the city also joined the struggle on the same day. By June 18, students in Istanbul had occupied three more schools.

The Turkish authorities, who have been severely impacted by the student movement, are plotting to suppress the student movement. Recently, the Turkish National Security Council held a meeting to discuss reactionary measures to deal with the student movement.

MONTEVIDEO, June 22 (Xinhua) — More than a thousand students in the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo, held a demonstration on June 20 to protest against the Uruguayan government's so-called emergency security measures and reactionary decrees, and to demand that the government sever ties with the International Monetary Fund controlled by U.S. imperialism.

The demonstrating students chanted anti-U.S. and anti-government slogans as they marched along the main streets of Montevideo. They also built barricades with benches to resist the military police who came to suppress the demonstration.

Additionally, more than 200 students held a rally and march in the busy district of Montevideo, throwing stones at the office building of the Pan American Airways Company in Montevideo.

Due to the implementation of the reactionary policies of the International Monetary Fund by the Uruguayan authorities, the economy of Uruguay has continued to deteriorate, and the broad masses of laboring people are struggling on the brink of hunger and death. To fight for their right to survive, the workers and students of Uruguay have recently been engaged in continuous struggles, dealing heavy blows to the rule of U.S. imperialism and the Uruguayan monopoly capitalist groups.

    各国工人和学生运动蓬勃发展

    新华社二十三日讯　多伦多消息：加拿大各行业的工人两万多人，举行大规模的罢工斗争，反对资本家敲骨吸髓的剥削，要求增加工资。
    圣劳伦斯航运系统的一千多名航运工人，二十一日起举行罢工，要求在今后两年的合同里规定增加工资百分之十八。航运工人们两天的罢工斗争，使三百多艘海上和内河航船陷于停顿。这是圣劳伦斯航运系统十年来发生的第一次罢工。
    圣劳伦斯水运系统是加拿大的水运要道，联系着蒙特利尔和大湖区，运输繁忙。水运工人的罢工给予加拿大垄断资产阶级以沉重打击。
    在联接其他各大湖的各运河上的水运工人，也举行了罢工。
    在加拿大其他各行业，如纸浆和造纸、农业机器、汽车制造、轮胎制造、炼钢和采矿等工业部门，有两万多人也正在进行罢工斗争，其中大部分是工业中心安大略省的工人。例如设在多伦多和布兰特福德的马西·福格逊公司的六千名工人，自四月十九日以来一直在进行罢工。在哈密尔顿，加拿大国际收割机公司的两千多工人，从六月十八日开始举行罢工。在多伦多，处理垃圾、污水和维护街道的市政工人也在举行罢工。
    新华社墨尔本二十日电　澳大利亚三千名造船工人十九日深夜开始举行二十四小时的全国性罢工，抗议澳大利亚一些航运公司把建造或改建船只的工程交给外国造船厂。罢工使造船工作陷于停顿。
    墨尔本五十名负责港口安全的工人二十日举行罢工，要求增加工资。
    新华社二十一日讯　安卡拉消息：已经坚持了十一天的土耳其学生要求改革教育制度的罢课斗争，目前正在继续发展。罢课运动已经扩及全国四十六所大专院校中的半数以上学校。参加罢课的学生人数达到六万五千名。
    安卡拉大学学生在举行了五天的罢课以后，曾于十五日到总理府提出他们的要求。其他学生在土耳其广播公司的大楼外面举行示威，抗议电台歪曲宣传学生罢课运动的消息。
    此外，土耳其另一个大城市伊斯坦布尔学生在十二日占领了这个城市的几所主要大学后，十七日又占领了一所技术大学。这个城市的美术学院和弗洛伦斯·南丁格尔护士学校学生也在同一天加入了斗争行列。到十八日，伊斯坦布尔的学生又占领了另外三所学校。
    受到学生斗争浪潮猛烈冲击的土耳其当局，正在策划对学生运动的镇压。最近土耳其国家安全委员会曾开会讨论对付学生运动的反动措施。
    新华社二十二日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚一千多名学生二十日举行示威游行，抗议乌拉圭政府实行所谓紧急安全措施的反动法令，并且要求政府同美帝国主义控制的国际货币基金组织断绝关系。
    示威学生高呼反美反政府的口号，沿着蒙得维的亚的主要街道前进。他们还用木凳筑起街垒，抗击前来镇压游行示威学生的军警。
    另外，二百多名学生在蒙得维的亚闹市区举行集会和游行，他们用石头袭击了美国泛美航空公司在蒙得维的亚的办公大楼。
    由于乌拉圭当局执行国际货币基金组织的反动政策，致使乌拉圭经济日益恶化，广大劳动人民挣扎在饥饿与死亡线上。为了争取生存权利，乌拉圭工人和学生最近连续进行斗争，沉重地打击了美帝国主义和乌拉圭垄断资本集团的统治。
