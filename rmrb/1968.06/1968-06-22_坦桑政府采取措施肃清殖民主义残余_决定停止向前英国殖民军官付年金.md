Tanzanian Government Takes Measures to Eliminate Remnants of Colonialism
Decides to Stop Paying Pensions to Former British Colonial Officers

DARES SALAAM, June 19 (Xinhua) — Tanzanian Finance Minister Jamal, in a speech on the budget issue in the National Assembly on June 18, announced that Tanzania has stopped paying pensions, compensation, and indemnity to former British colonial officers who served the colonial authorities before Tanganyika's independence in 1961. This decision will be implemented immediately. The Tanzanian newspaper "Nationalist" reported on this decision, saying: This is another measure taken by the Tanzanian government to "eliminate the remnants of colonialism."

According to the "agreement" imposed by British imperialism at the time of Tanganyika's independence, Tanzania was to continue to bear the responsibility of paying pensions, compensation, and indemnity to former British officers who had served the British colonial authorities. British imperialism thus plundered approximately 20 million shillings from Tanzania annually through this "agreement."

    坦桑政府采取措施肃清殖民主义残余
    决定停止向前英国殖民军官付年金
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆十九日电　坦桑尼亚财政部长贾马勒，十八日就预算问题在国民议会发表讲话时宣布，坦桑尼亚已停止向一九六一年坦噶尼喀独立以前为殖民当局服务的前英国殖民军官付给年金、折偿金和补偿金。这一决定立即执行。坦桑尼亚《民族主义者报》在报道这一决定时说：这是坦桑尼亚政府“肃清殖民主义残余的又一措施”。
    根据英帝国主义在坦噶尼喀独立时强加的“协定”，独立后，坦桑尼亚要继续承担向曾为英国殖民当局服务的前英国军官付给年金、折偿金和补偿金的义务。英帝国主义通过“协定”每年从坦桑尼亚掠夺了约两千万先令。
