A Malian military delegation led by Mamadou Diakité, a ministerial-level representative responsible for defense and security of the Republic of Mali, returned to the Malian capital of Bamako on the afternoon of the 19th after a 15-day friendly visit to China.

Those who went to the airport to welcome the delegation included: Member of the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, Minister of Justice and Labor Madiara Keita, Member of the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ousmane Ba, and Chief of Staff of the Malian Army Seydou Traoré.

Liu He Lin, the chargé d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Mali, also went to the airport to welcome the delegation.

At the airport lounge, Mamadou Diakité spoke to the press, enthusiastically praising China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great achievements in China's industry and agriculture. He said, "During our stay in China, we clearly saw how the Chinese people, under the leadership of their great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, were mobilized to carry out an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." He wished this revolution "complete victory." After praising China's industrial production achievements, he said: "In every respect, the people's communes are successful." He pointed out that the people's communes ensured that more than 500 million Chinese farmers took the road of collectivization, ensuring high yields in agriculture.

Mamadou Diakité finally said that the Malian military delegation returned to Mali with the lessons learned in China. Although Mali currently faces various difficulties, as long as it dares to struggle, dares to win, and relies on its own strength, it will definitely be able to solve the difficulties. He expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Chinese people and the Chinese government for their enthusiastic and friendly reception of the Malian military delegation.
