Under the assistance of the PLA stationed at the mine, the latest instructions from Chairman Mao have been further implemented. Revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination continue to consolidate and develop, and the revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit are closely integrated. The entire mine exceeded the state plan in April and completed the state plan ahead of schedule in May.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, June 13 — The revolutionary committee of Agang Town Coal Mine in Gansu Province, under the assistance of the PLA stationed at the mine, has followed the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, emphasized proletarian politics, focused on class struggle, and promoted the revolutionization of the leading cadre. In the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has been increasingly consolidated and developed, showing immense power and strong vitality. Currently, the entire mining area presents a prosperous scene. Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions have been further implemented, revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination continue to consolidate and develop, and the revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit are deeply carried out. Following the completion of the state plan in April, the entire mine completed the state plan ahead of schedule in May.

Put the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work

The more complex the work, the more important it is to grasp the fundamentals and put the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, promoting the revolutionization of people's thoughts. This is the most fundamental experience of the revolutionary committee of Agang Town Coal Mine in continuously consolidating and developing. After the revolutionary committee of Agang Town Coal Mine was established in November last year, various complex tasks emerged simultaneously, and various problems needed to be solved. Faced with this situation, the PLA stationed at the mine brought the principle of emphasizing political construction to the revolutionary committee from the beginning, making the revolutionary committee remember to emphasize proletarian politics and insist on leading with Mao Zedong Thought in all work from the day of its establishment.

"Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in the study classes." The mine revolutionary committee followed Chairman Mao's instructions and held more than 70 study classes of various types. Almost all revolutionary workers in the mine participated in the study. They studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions seriously in the study classes, carried forward the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, learned a little, applied a little, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, eliminated private interests and established public interests, and continuously promoted the revolutionization of people's thoughts. Revolutionary workers generally reflected that through study, everyone worked with the "public" spirit of the proletariat and fought with loyalty to Chairman Mao. The study class was a solution to problems.

Through the extensive and thorough holding of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the mass movement of actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire mine has reached a new high. From the revolutionary committees at all levels to the grassroots teams, all have established unshakable study systems. Revolutionary workers in the entire mine read Chairman Mao's books every day, often hold reporting meetings, help each other, promote each other, and work together to improve thought revolutionization. The revolutionary committee combined the leadership of the entire mine's revolutionary workers in carrying out the great mass movement of actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought with the "three loyalties" activity of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, continuously guiding the broad revolutionary workers to have a "loyal" heart towards the great leader Chairman Mao, and a "use" spirit towards the great Mao Zedong Thought, requiring everyone to study with problems, compare, apply, and summarize, achieving consistency in words and deeds, and consistency in learning and application. Revolutionary workers and members of the revolutionary committee combined the struggle against revisionism and the fight against selfishness, exploding a revolution in their souls. They said: Only by uprooting the foundation of "selfishness" and building a great wall of "public interests," using Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions, can we forever maintain our revolutionary youth, consolidate the revolutionary committee, and make our proletarian dictatorship unchanged for thousands of years.

Fiercely grasp class struggle and launch a fierce attack on class enemies

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, some workers became complacent and overconfident in the face of the increasingly good revolutionary situation. Some thought that the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party in the mine had been exposed and overthrown, and even if a few flies buzzed, they could not cause trouble; some thought that now the revolutionary committee had been established, the power issue had been solved, and it was time to focus on production. Some members of the revolutionary committee also thought that with power in hand and the situation stabilized, they could "relax."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will inevitably make desperate struggles." Under the assistance of the PLA stationed at the mine, the members of the mine revolutionary committee seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings. They deeply realized that the establishment of the mine revolutionary committee did not mean the end of class struggle. A small clique of unrepentant capitalist roaders, untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries are extremely hostile to the new proletarian revolutionary power. They are using more hidden and cunning methods to carry out sabotage and disruption, attempting to overthrow the newly established revolutionary committee. After the members of the revolutionary committee raised their awareness, they organized the revolutionary workers of the entire mine to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, arming their minds with Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," and linking it with the actual class struggle of the mine. They fiercely criticized the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of China's Khrushchev. In this way, everyone's eyes were opened, and their class struggle awareness was greatly enhanced. They realized that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to a comprehensive victory, the more complex and profound the class struggle becomes. We must talk about class struggle year after year, month after month, and day after day, and grasp it year after year, month after month, and day after day. We must never relax our vigilance against class enemies because of victory. Everyone recognized the current class struggle situation, and the revolutionary committee grasped the initiative in class struggle. They linked it with the actual class struggle of the unit, carried out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, and launched an attack on class enemies.

Vice Chairman Lin said: "If you do not understand what class is, do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution." The revolutionary committee also often conducted class education of comparing the old and new societies among the broad revolutionary workers to improve the class awareness of the masses and enhance the class struggle awareness. The PLA stationed at the mine and the revolutionary committee organized the old workers who suffered greatly before liberation in various study classes and work teams to recall the class bitterness of the old society, think about the sweetness of the new society, and highly praise the boundless grace of Chairman Mao.

The class education of comparing the old and new societies strongly promoted the mass revolutionary criticism and the deepening of the struggle against enemies. Everyone said that the power seized by the revolutionary faction of the proletariat under the leadership of Chairman Mao must be defended with struggle. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the broad revolutionary workers resolutely struck down the counter-revolutionary wind of reversing cases, exposed and smashed the plots of class enemies attempting to overthrow the revolutionary committee, and defended the newly established proletarian revolutionary power with struggle time and time again.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the condition of socialism. It is the continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary people under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The members of the revolutionary committee of Agang Town Coal Mine studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions in connection with their own revolutionary struggle practice, and felt even more that Chairman Mao's teachings are extremely wise and great. Currently, they are leading the revolutionary workers of the entire mine to launch an even more fierce attack on a small clique of class enemies under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Close ties with the masses and achieve the revolutionization of the leading cadre

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental principle of the reform of state organs is to connect with the masses." The revolutionary committee of Agang Town Coal Mine seriously studied Chairman Mao's teaching and regarded connecting with the masses as an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

When the revolutionary committee was just born, some comrades in the leading cadre were willing to be busy "upstairs" and did not want to do hard work again, participated less in production labor, and became distant from the masses; some comrades became arrogant in the face of victory, grew "official airs," liked flattery, and could not tolerate criticism. As soon as these bad tendencies appeared, the members of the revolutionary committee, under the help of the PLA stationed at the mine, took "The Three Articles" as their motto, compared themselves, and raised their awareness. Through the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, they firmly established the thought of being a servant of the people. Many leading comrades said: "The masses trust us to be good servants of the people, not to be officials and lords. The more official airs grow, the farther the masses are, and we must never act arrogantly and alienate the masses." They resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an official and a common person," and went out of their offices to the masses. Except for the necessity of taking turns on duty and temporary work, the leading comrades all went deep into the grassroots and the masses, studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought with the workers, participated in the struggle against enemies, worked in the mine, and discussed major revolutionary and production matters together, achieving thought work on the spot, organizational command on the spot, and problem-solving on the spot. Many new comrades participating in the leading work, their positions changed, but their working-class nature did not change; their status changed, but their oil-stained work clothes did not change. They were both battle commanders and ordinary laborers, did not act arrogantly, did not talk about special treatment, and insisted on being with the masses all the time. The miners said: Such cadres, we can see them, get along with them, and trust them.

The revolutionary committee and the leading comrades of the subordinate grassroots power organs often visited the workers and had heart-to-heart talks with the masses, listening to the opinions of the masses at any time. The revolutionary committee regularly held meetings to specially listen to the criticisms of the masses, study and handle the suggestions proposed by the masses, and seriously conducted self-criticism. Because they listened to Chairman Mao's words, maintained close ties with the masses, and had a heart-to-heart connection with the masses, they gained the sincere support of the masses. The newly born revolutionary committee became more and more consolidated, its prestige became higher and higher, and its power became greater and greater.

    坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅突出无产阶级政治
    阿干镇煤矿革委会在阶级斗争中巩固发展
    在驻矿解放军帮助下，毛主席的最新指示进一步落实，革命大联合和革命三结合不断巩固和发展，革命大批判和本单位斗、批、改紧密结合。全矿四月份超额完成国家计划，五月份又提前完成国家计划
    新华社兰州十三日电　甘肃省阿干镇煤矿革命委员会在驻矿解放军支左人员的帮助下，沿着毛主席指引的航向，大力突出无产阶级政治，大抓阶级斗争，大搞领导班子的革命化，在率领革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，日益得到巩固和发展，显示出巨大的威力和强大的生命力。目前，整个矿区的革命和生产呈现出一派欣欣向荣的景象。毛主席的一系列最新指示进一步落实，革命的大联合和革命的三结合不断巩固和发展，革命大批判和本单位的斗、批、改正深入开展。全矿继四月份超额完成国家计划以后，五月份又提前七天超额完成了国家计划。
    把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位
    工作越是千头万绪，越要紧紧抓住根本，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，大力促进人的思想革命化，这是阿干镇煤矿革委会不断得到巩固和发展的一条最基本的经验。阿干镇煤矿革命委员会在去年十一月成立以后，千头万绪的工作一齐涌了上来，各种各样的问题都需要去解决。面对这种情况，驻矿解放军支左人员一开始就把毛主席着重政治建军的原则带给革命委员会，使矿革委会从成立那天起，就念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅。
    “办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”矿革命委员会遵照毛主席的教导，先后举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班七十多期，全矿革命职工基本上都参加了学习。他们在学习班里认真学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，学一点，用一点，斗私批修，破私立公，不断促进人的思想革命化。革命职工普遍反映：通过学习，大家带着无产阶级的“公”字去工作，带着对毛主席的忠心去战斗，学习班就是解决问题。
    通过大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，全矿活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动掀起了新高潮。从各级革委会到基层班组，都订立了雷打不动的学习制度。全矿革命职工天天读毛主席的书，经常举行讲用会，互相帮助，互相促进，共同搞好思想革命化。矿革委会把领导全矿革命职工开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，和开展无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动紧密结合起来，不断引导广大革命职工对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对伟大的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，要求大家带着问题学习、对照、运用、总结，做到言行一致，学用一致。革命职工和革委会的成员，把批修和斗私紧密结合起来，在灵魂深处爆发革命。他们说：只有铲除了“私”字的根基，筑起“公”字的长城，用毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，才能使我们永葆革命的青春，使革委会得到巩固，使我们的无产阶级政权千秋万代永不变色。
    狠抓阶级斗争，主动向阶级敌人猛烈进攻
    矿革委会成立后，有些职工在越来越好的革命形势面前，产生了麻痹轻敌的思想。有的认为，矿上党内一小撮走资派，已被揪出来打倒，即使有几个苍蝇嗡嗡叫，也成不了气候；有的认为，如今建立了革委会，政权问题已经解决，该集中力量抓抓生产了。革委会中个别成员，也以为大权在手，大局已定，可以“松一口气”了。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”在驻矿解放军支左人员的帮助下，矿革命委员会的成员认真学习了毛主席的教导。他们深刻地认识到，矿革命委员会的成立，决不意味着阶级斗争的结束。一小撮顽固不化的走资派，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，国民党反动派的残渣余孽，对新生的无产阶级革命政权十分仇视，他们正采取更隐蔽、更狡猾的方式从事破坏和捣乱，妄图颠覆新生的革命委员会。革委会成员认识提高以后，便组织全矿革命职工认真学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，以毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导武装头脑，联系本矿的阶级斗争实际，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。这样，大家擦亮了眼睛，大大增强了阶级斗争观念。他们认识到，无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是复杂，越是深刻，我们对阶级斗争就是要年年讲、月月讲、天天讲，年年抓、月月抓、天天抓，决不可因为胜利而放松对于阶级敌人的警惕性。大家认清了当前阶级斗争形势，革委会就掌握了阶级斗争的主动权。他们联系本单位阶级斗争实际，深入持久地开展革命大批判，主动向阶级敌人发起了进攻。
    林副主席指示说：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”矿革委会还经常在广大革命职工中进行新旧社会回忆对比的阶级教育，以提高群众的阶级觉悟，增强阶级斗争观念。驻矿解放军和矿革委会就在各个学习班、各个作业队，组织解放前苦大仇深的老工人，忆旧社会的阶级苦，思新社会的甜，大赞大颂毛主席的无限恩情。
    回忆对比的阶级教育，有力地推动了群众性的革命大批判和深入开展对敌斗争。大家说，无产阶级革命派在毛主席领导下夺得的权利，我们一定要用战斗来保卫。广大革命职工在矿革委会的领导下，坚决打击了阶级敌人的翻案妖风，揭露和粉碎了阶级敌人妄图颠覆革命委员会的阴谋活动，一次又一次地用战斗捍卫了新生的无产阶级革命政权。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”阿干镇煤矿革委会的成员，联系自己的革命斗争实践学习了毛主席的这一最新指示，更加体会到毛主席的教导无比英明伟大。目前，他们正在毛主席最新指示的指引下，领导全矿革命职工向一小撮阶级敌人展开更加猛烈的进攻。
    密切联系群众，实现领导班子革命化
    毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”阿干镇煤矿革命委员会认真学习了毛主席的这一教导，他们把联系群众看成是忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的一个重要标志。
    矿革委会刚诞生时，在领导班子中，有的同志情愿在上边“忙碌”，不想再下去做艰苦的工作，参加生产劳动少了，同群众的关系疏远了；也有的同志在胜利面前，居功骄傲起来，滋长了
  “官气”，喜欢人家奉承，听不得批评。这些不良倾向刚一露头，革委会成员就在驻矿解放军同志的帮助下，以“老三篇”为座右铭，对照自己，提高认识。大家通过斗私批修，大立做人民勤务员的思想。不少领导成员说：“群众信任我们，是要我们好好做人民的勤务员，而不是让我们做官当老爷。官气长一分，群众远千里，万万不可摆架子，脱离了群众。”他们坚决照毛主席关于“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导办事，纷纷走出办公室，深入到群众里面去。矿革委会除轮流值班和临时工作必需外，领导成员都深入基层，深入群众，和工人一起活学活用毛泽东思想，一起参加对敌斗争，一起下井生产劳动，共同商量革命和生产大事，做到思想工作到现场，组织指挥到现场，解决问题到现场。许多新参加领导工作的同志，他们职务变了，工人阶级的本色不变；地位换了，沾满油泥的工作服不换。他们既是战斗指挥者，又是普通劳动者，不摆官架子，不讲特殊化，一直坚持和群众在一起。矿工们说：这样的干部，我们就是看得上，合得来，信得过。
    矿革委会和所属基层权力机构的领导成员，还经常访问职工，和群众谈心，随时倾听群众的意见。矿革委会定期召开会议，专门听取群众的批评，研究处理群众提出的建议，认真地做自我批评。由于他们听毛主席的话，保持和群众的密切联系，和群众心连心，取得了群众真心实意的支持。新生的革命委员会越来越巩固，威信越来越高，威力越来越大。（附图片）
