The US imperialists and Soviet revisionists have once again collaborated to concoct a major political conspiracy and fraud. Under the manipulation of the US and the Soviet Union, the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee, despite strong opposition from Albania, Tanzania, and many other African countries, forcibly passed the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" on June 10. This is a serious step in the counter-revolutionary global collusion of the US imperialists and the Soviet revisionist clique, following their joint efforts in 1963 to push through the "Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty." It is another political conspiracy and fraud they have conspired to play; at the same time, it is a serious step in their open alliance of nuclear military forces against China, against communism, against the people, and against revolution.

It is well known that the imperialists led by the United States and their lackeys are the root cause of contemporary wars. The threat of nuclear war comes from the US imperialists and their accomplices. The "Non-Proliferation Treaty" that the US and the Soviet Union have been plotting for many years does not hinder their production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons, nor does it hinder their use of nuclear weapons in war; in fact, the United States has already established many nuclear bases around the world, and US nuclear weapons have spread to every corner of the globe. Therefore, the essence of the US and the Soviet Union's concoction of this treaty is to use the pretext of "preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons" to deprive other countries of the right to develop self-defense nuclear weapons, so as to maintain the bankrupt nuclear monopoly of the US and the Soviet Union. This will allow them to more freely engage in nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats, and use this treaty to further strengthen their global counter-revolutionary collusion, undermining the revolutionary movements of the people of the world.

When the US and the Soviet Union were brewing this treaty, their first target was China. They attempted to use such a treaty to shackle China's hands and feet and obstruct China's development of self-defense nuclear weapons. Today, with China already possessing atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, they are again attempting to use such a treaty to incite a new wave of anti-China sentiment and "isolate" the great Chinese people. In the process of concocting this treaty, the US and the Soviet Union also announced that they would provide "nuclear protection" for non-nuclear countries that join this treaty. Western news agencies acknowledge that this is even more obviously directed against China. The US and the Soviet Union are doing this not only to slander the Chinese people's development of self-defense nuclear weapons as a "nuclear threat" to other countries, thereby inciting anti-China sentiment; but also to create a "legal basis" for their joint nuclear encirclement and nuclear threats against China.

This treaty is a product of big-power politics and is a thoroughly unequal treaty. It fully exposes the evil intentions of the US and the Soviet Union to further control and bully other countries. The treaty not only unilaterally requires non-nuclear countries to undertake the obligation of not developing or possessing nuclear weapons, but it even does not allow them to develop nuclear explosive devices in the peaceful use of atomic energy. On the other hand, the two "nuclear bullies," the US and the Soviet Union, are not subject to any restrictions. Moreover, they can, under the pretext of providing "nuclear protection," even more brazenly spread nuclear weapons by building nuclear bases everywhere, dispatching aircraft and warships carrying nuclear weapons, and enslaving and threatening other countries.

The US and the Soviet Union have been plotting to concoct such a treaty for a long time. After several years of mutual probing and bargaining, in June of last year, during the secret talks between Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin and US imperialist leader Johnson in Glassboro, they finally reached an agreement. Subsequently, the representatives of the two countries threw out the draft of this treaty at the August Geneva Disarmament Conference of 17 nations and immediately launched a frenzied promotional campaign. However, this treaty, which infringes upon the sovereignty and dignity of other countries, has been opposed from the outset by many countries, and even some of the US and the Soviet Union's lackeys have expressed dissatisfaction. Many countries have put forward various reservations and amendments at the meeting. It was only after the US and Soviet representatives made blatant threats and inducements and made some minor changes to the draft treaty that, in mid-March of this year, the Geneva Disarmament Conference of 17 nations decided to submit the draft treaty and some countries' reservations to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion.

Immediately afterward, the US and the Soviet Union submitted the draft treaty to the reconvened 22nd session of the United Nations General Assembly at the end of April, attempting to hastily pass it so that they could use the "United Nations" banner to deceive other countries into signing the treaty. However, this plot did not succeed. Under the strong opposition of many countries, the draft treaty was first "kicked" to the Political Committee of the General Assembly. In the six-week Political Committee meeting, the treaty faced even broader and stronger opposition and condemnation than at the Geneva Disarmament Conference. The Albanian representative, Budho, pointed out in his speech that this treaty is not a disarmament measure at all; on the contrary, it will legalize the remaining nuclear monopoly of the US and the Soviet Union. He also pointed out that this treaty and the US and Soviet Union's scheme to provide so-called "nuclear protection" are mainly directed against the great People's Republic of China and the people of various countries who love freedom and independence. The Albanian representative emphasized that signing such a treaty would help the global conspiracy of the US and the Soviet Union against the people of various countries. The representative of Tanzania exposed the neo-colonial nature of this treaty in his speech. Representatives of many other Asian and African countries also expressed varying degrees of reservation or opposition to the draft treaty and demanded that the vote be postponed to the next session of the United Nations General Assembly.

At the Political Committee of the General Assembly, the representatives of the US and the Soviet Union once again played good cop, bad cop, threatening and inducing other countries to fall into their trap. Sometimes they bared their fangs and snarled: "Whoever does not support this treaty will not only fail to obtain the 'benefits' that may be obtained from joining this treaty, but will also be responsible for the 'serious consequences' that may arise from it." Sometimes, they spoke in the tone of a businessman, saying that signing this treaty is "beneficial to all countries" and that this is an "opportunity that may never come again." At the same time, they made some textual changes to the draft treaty to show their "concessions" to countries with reservations and opposition, such as changing the requirement for the United Nations General Assembly to "endorse" the treaty to "recommend" the treaty, and changing the original proposal's mention of taking "effective steps" to reduce nuclear armaments after signing this treaty to "take such steps as soon as possible."

The dirty political deal between the US and the Soviet Union, after being delayed for many years, was finally concluded at this moment, which is not accidental. This shows that, under the impact of the fierce waves of revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the struggles of the people of Europe and North America against the brutal rule of their own monopolistic capital, the imperialist bloc led by the United States is in deep crisis and unprecedented difficulties, while the Soviet revisionist clique is also rapidly disintegrating and having a harder time. Under these circumstances, both the US imperialists and the Soviet revisionists urgently need to further strengthen their collusion and struggle to save their failing destinies.

After the treaty is passed by the Political Committee of the General Assembly, it will be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for passage. After that, it will be signed by the US, the Soviet Union, the UK, and some other countries to take effect.

    美帝苏修又合伙炮制一个政治大阴谋大骗局
    美苏操纵联大政委会通过所谓“防止核扩散”条约大搞核讹诈
    阿尔巴尼亚坦桑尼亚等国代表严正揭露骗人条约的反革命本质
    据新华社十一日讯　本社记者报道：在美帝、苏修的操纵下，联合国大会政治委员会不顾阿尔巴尼亚、坦桑尼亚等国的强烈反对以及许多非洲国家的严重保留，在十日强行通过了美苏合伙炮制的所谓“防止核扩散”条约。这是正在加紧反革命全球勾结的美帝国主义和苏修领导集团，继一九六三年八月搞成“部分禁止核试验”条约之后，合谋玩弄的又一个政治大阴谋、大骗局；同时，这也是美苏公开结成反华、反共、反人民、反革命核军事同盟的一个严重步骤。
    众所周知，以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗是当代战争的根源。核战争威胁是来自美帝国主义及其帮凶。美苏策划多年的这个所谓“防止核扩散”条约，既不妨碍它们制造和储存核武器，也不妨碍它们在战争中使用核武器；而且事实上，美国早在世界各地建立了许多核基地，美国的核武器已经扩散到了全世界。因此，美苏炮制这个条约的实质，是要在“防止扩散核武器”的幌子下，剥夺其它国家发展自卫核武器的权利，以保持美苏两家破了产的核垄断地位，便于它们更加放手地搞核讹诈和核威胁，并利用这个条约进一步加强它们的全球反革命大勾结，破坏世界人民的革命运动。
    美苏在酝酿这一条约时，矛头首先是针对中国的，它们妄图利用这样一个条约来束缚中国的手脚，阻止中国发展自卫的核武器。今天，在中国已经有了原子弹、氢弹的情况下，它们又企图利用这样一个条约来煽起新的反华浪潮，
  “孤立”伟大的中国人民。美苏在拼凑这个条约的过程中，还宣布它们将为参加这个条约的无核国家联合提供“核保护”。西方通讯社承认，这更是明显地直接针对中国的。美苏这样做不仅是为了诬蔑中国人民发展自卫核武器是对别国的“核威胁”，从而煽动反华；而且是为它们合伙对中国实行核包围、核威胁制造“合法依据”。
    这个条约完全是大国强权政治的产物，是一个地地道道的不平等条约。它充分暴露了美苏妄图进一步控制和欺侮别的国家的罪恶居心。条约不仅片面地要求无核国家承担不发展、不拥有核武器的义务，而且甚至不许它们在和平利用原子能方面发展核爆炸装置，而另一方面，美苏这两个“核霸王”却不受任何限制。不仅如此，它们还可以在提供“核保护”的名义下，甚至更加放肆地通过到处修建核基地、派驻携带核武器的飞机、舰艇，来扩散核武器，奴役和威胁其他国家。
    美苏密谋炮制这样一个条约为时已久。它们经过几年的彼此摸底和讨价还价，在苏修一再作了重大让步之后，去年六月间，在苏修头目柯西金同美帝头子约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗的秘密会谈中终于拍板成交。接着，两国代表就在去年八月的日内瓦十七国“裁军”会议上抛出了这个条约的草案，并随之展开了狂热的推销活动。但是，这个损害别国主权、尊严的奴役性条约从一开始提出就遭到了许多国家的反对，甚至美苏的某些仆从也表示不满。许多国家纷纷在会上提出各种保留意见和修正案。只是在美苏代表多方进行露骨的威胁、利诱，同时对条约草案作了某些细微末节的“修改”之后，才在今年三月中旬的十七国日内瓦“裁军”会议上决定把条约草案和一些国家的保留意见一起交联合国大会讨论。
    紧接着，美苏便把条约草案提到四月底复会的第二十二届联合国大会，企图草草通过，以便于它们打着“联合国”这块招牌去骗取其它国家在条约上签字画押。但是，这个阴谋并未得逞。在许多国家的强烈反对下，条约草案首先被“踢”到了联大政委会。在历时六周的政委会会议上，这个条约遭到了比在日内瓦“裁军”会议上更加广泛、强烈的反对和谴责。阿尔巴尼亚代表布多在发言中指出，这个条约决不是什么裁军措施，相反，这只会使美苏在原子武器方面的残余垄断合法化。他还指出，这个条约以及美苏关于提供所谓“核保护”的方案，其矛头都主要是指向伟大的中华人民共和国以及爱好自由和独立的各国人民的。这位阿尔巴尼亚代表强调指出，在这种条约上签字就会给反对各国人民的美苏全球阴谋帮忙。坦桑尼亚的代表在发言中揭露了这个条约的新殖民主义的性质。其它许多亚非国家的代表也都对条约草案表示了不同程度的保留或反对，并且要求推迟到下届联合国大会上表决。
    在联大政委会的会上会下，美帝苏修代表再次一搭一档，一呼一应，交替玩弄威胁、利诱的两手，来诱迫其它国家陷入他们设下的圈套。他们一会儿凶相毕露地叫嚣：谁不支持这个条约，谁就不仅得不到参加这个条约可能得到的“好处”，而且要对由此而产生的“严重后果”“负责”；一会儿，又用一种生意人的口吻叫卖，说什么签订这个条约“对一切国家都有利”，这是一个“以后可能永远不会再出现的机会”等等。同时，它们还再次对条约草案作了一点文字辞句上的“修改”，以示对持保留和反对意见的国家的“让步”，例如，把要求联合国大会“赞同”这个条约改成“推荐”这个条约，把原提案中提到的关于签订这个条约后“必须采取”裁减核军备的“有效步骤”，改成“必须尽快采取”这种步骤等。
    美苏之间的这笔肮脏的政治交易在拖延多年之后，在目前这样一个时刻最后成交，这决不是偶然的。这表明，在当前亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民革命斗争和欧洲、北美人民反对本国垄断资本残暴统治的斗争浪潮的猛烈冲击下，以美国为首的帝国主义集团危机重重、困境空前，而苏修集团也正加速分崩离析，日子越来越不好过。在这种情况下，美帝、苏修两家都急需进一步加强它们的勾结，进行挣扎，以挽救它们垂危的命运。
    这个条约在联大政委会通过后，还将提到联合国大会通过。之后，要由美、苏、英三家以及其它一些国家在上面签字才能正式开始生效。
