British state-owned British Overseas Airways Corporation's 1,000 pilots went on strike from the early hours of the 16th, protesting against the authorities' refusal to meet their reasonable demands for a pay raise.

This strike has dealt a heavy blow to British monopoly capital. The chairman of British Overseas Airways Corporation, Giles Guthrie, admitted uneasily that the strike would cost the company £350,000 in revenue per day. Since a significant portion of this loss is in foreign exchange, it inevitably directly affects Britain's already precarious international balance of payments.

In the Ford Motor Company's Dagenham factory in Britain, 187 sewing women workers have been on strike since last week, demanding equal pay for equal work with men. They have stated that they will not return to work until their demands are met. About 200 women workers in the Liverpool factory have also recently gone on strike for half a day to support the sewing women workers' strike in Dagenham. The sewing women workers in the Dagenham factory are responsible for sewing car seats and interior decorations. Their strike has resulted in thousands of cars lacking seats and other items piling up in the factory's parking lot, unable to be shipped out.

    英国女工起来罢工反抗剥削
    据新华社讯　英国国营海外航空公司的一千名飞机驾驶员，从十六日凌晨开始罢工，抗议当局拒绝他们关于增加工资的合理要求。
    这次罢工使英国垄断资本受到沉重打击。英国海外航空公司董事长贾尔斯·格思里不安地承认，罢工将使这家公司的收入每天损失三十五万镑。由于这笔损失中有很大一部分是外汇，这就不可避免地使危机深重的英国国际收支状况受到直接影响。
    在英国的美资福特汽车公司戴根纳姆工厂的一百八十七个缝纫女工一直坚持从上周开始的罢工，要求同男工同工同酬。她们表示，不达目的，绝不复工。利物浦工厂的大约二百名女工为支持戴根纳姆工厂的缝纫女工的罢工斗争，最近也罢工半天。戴根纳姆工厂的缝纫女工的工作是为汽车缝制座垫及车内装饰品。她们的罢工，使得数以千计缺乏座垫等物的汽车堆积在工厂的停车场里，而不能出厂。
