In the face of the fierce attacks launched by the military and people of South Vietnam since the New Year, over 900 soldiers from the main forces and local units of the puppet army in Binh Tuy Province have refused to continue fighting for U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique. On May 5, they issued a statement announcing their mutiny.

In their statement, the mutinous soldiers called on the puppet soldiers and officials to quickly turn their guns on the American aggressors and their lackeys, join the ranks of the patriots, and together with the entire people, thoroughly annihilate the U.S. invaders and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky traitorous puppet clique.
