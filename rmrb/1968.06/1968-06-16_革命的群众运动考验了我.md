The revolutionary mass movement has tested me.

When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, I did not understand this great and magnificent revolutionary mass movement. However, in my mind, I firmly believed in one thing: this Cultural Revolution was personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. Whatever Chairman Mao said, I would do. In the "Sixteen Points" personally formulated by Chairman Mao, it says: "Whether the Party's leadership dares to mobilize the masses will determine the fate of this Cultural Revolution." I am the Party branch secretary of the Fish Village Brigade in Shandong Village Commune, Pinggu County, Beijing. How should I treat this mass movement? I recalled Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." I made up my mind to follow Chairman Mao's words, to be bold, and to mobilize the masses in this revolutionary mass movement, to temper and test myself.

Once my thoughts were clear, I convened a meeting of the brigade cadres and the masses, and together we studied Chairman Mao's instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the "Sixteen Points," helping everyone to understand the significance of the Cultural Revolution. I told everyone: I have been a cadre for many years and must have many shortcomings and mistakes. I hope everyone will expose and criticize them, and I will also conduct a thorough self-examination. To facilitate the posting of big-character posters by the masses, I even personally made a thatched shed and bought paper.

However, the attitude towards the mass movement is not something that can be resolved overnight. The masses were mobilized, revolutionary mass organizations were established, and big-character posters criticizing me gradually increased. Seeing the walls inside and outside the room covered with big-character posters, I felt quite uncomfortable. I thought, I, Wang Jintong, am from a poor peasant family and have been herding cattle for the landlord since I was young. It was Chairman Mao who liberated me. I have been a cadre for more than twenty years, and even if I have no merits, I have at least worked hard! Why do the masses have such strong feelings towards me? Especially when I saw some bad elements deliberately fabricating my "crimes," I felt even more angry. At this time, Chairman Mao's teachings rang in my ears: "We must believe in the masses, we must believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles." I carefully looked at the content of the big-character posters. The vast majority were revolutionary youngsters and community members giving me sincere help. A few big-character posters were due to the masses not fully understanding the situation, and the facts were somewhat inaccurate. The slanders and fabrications of the bad elements were only individual cases. Some poor and lower-middle peasants wanted me to make some explanations. I thought, the masses have just been mobilized, and they gave me some advice. If I make explanations and clarifications here and there, how can the masses be further mobilized? I was born and raised in Fish Village, and the masses know me best. I completely believe that the masses will clarify the facts. The more big-character posters there are, the more it shows that the masses have been mobilized. Chairman Mao calls on us: "You should care about national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Everyone is following Chairman Mao's words and actively caring about national affairs. This is a great thing. Thinking of this, I felt particularly happy, and my work became even more focused.

We must not allow the class enemy to take advantage of the situation.

After the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ignited in Fish Village, the class enemies tried to take advantage of this opportunity to fish in troubled waters. They first fabricated some "crimes" against me, attempting to incite a few people who did not understand the truth to defame me. As soon as the big-character posters were posted, the poor and lower-middle peasants saw through their tricks and immediately posted big-character posters to counterattack.

One scheme failed, another was hatched. One day, while working on the embankment, I was pushing a cart to transport soil. A landlord element, with a fake smile, said, "You should load less, don't overwork yourself." I heard this and immediately got angry. This was clearly a wolf in sheep's clothing. I recalled the days of herding cattle for the landlord before liberation, when I had to get up before dawn to fetch water, and as soon as it was light, I had to go up the mountain to herd cattle. Barefoot, I climbed the mountains, my feet were pierced by thorns, and blood flowed, but I still had to fetch water and work. Every day, I worked from dawn to dusk, and even at night, I could not rest. I was so tired that when I had to relieve myself, I would collapse to the ground. In that old society of exploitation, none of you landlord elements cared about me! Now, I certainly will not fall for your tricks! I firmly told him: "Load your soil honestly! No matter how hard I work now, it is not as hard as when I worked for you. Now I am working for socialism and for the people, and I am willing to work hard no matter how tired I am."

This incident reminded me that in the past, our brigade had strict control over the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who had not been reformed. They dared not make any moves. Now, they saw that some cadres were not doing their jobs, and the revolutionary youngsters lacked experience, so they all had sly looks and were restless, even changing their tone of speech. This showed that the class enemies were trying to take advantage of our weaknesses. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It can only practice democracy within the people, and it must practice dictatorship over the class enemies at all times. Only the revolutionary factions of the proletariat can rebel, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists must not rebel. During a labor session, I clearly announced to the four types of elements: "You must work honestly and accept the supervision and reform of the people. It is not allowed for you class enemies to take advantage of the situation!" Under the supervision of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary youngsters, the four types of elements in our brigade did not dare to speak or act recklessly.

The revolutionary spirit of the masses must be firmly protected.

After the establishment of the revolutionary mass organizations in our brigade, the revolutionary youngsters, following Chairman Mao's teachings, actively participated in the Cultural Revolution, destroyed the four olds and established the four news, and practiced dictatorship over the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who had not been reformed. I fully supported their revolutionary actions. At first, I only felt that since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, Chairman Mao had repeatedly received the Red Guards and revolutionary masses. Whatever Chairman Mao supports, we should support and endorse.

Later, through contact with the revolutionary youngsters, I gradually felt that they had many advantages that old cadres did not have, and from them, I could learn many precious things. One incident had a great impact on me: During a meeting to criticize me, a sister of a rich peasant element specially came from another village to participate. She jumped onto the stage and talked nonsense about how I had wrongly classified her brother, attempting to use this opportunity to reverse the case. The revolutionary youngster presiding over the meeting saw through her plot and immediately stopped her speech, turning to the crowd and asking, "Is her brother's class status a rich peasant?" Everyone answered in unison, "Yes!" He then asked, "Is she trying to reverse the case for the rich peasant element?" Everyone answered in unison, "Yes!" Thus, this person who tried to reverse the case for the rich peasant element was driven off the stage in disgrace. The revolutionary youngsters' firm class stance and clear attitude of loving and hating deeply moved me, and I was so touched that I shed tears of joy.

One night, the emergency assembly alarm woke me up. I thought that although I had not joined the mass organization, I was a Communist Party member and had the responsibility to participate in the struggle with the revolutionary youngsters. I quickly put on my clothes and followed them to the commune. Halfway there, two revolutionary youngsters fell behind. I thought, our place is a mountainous area, the road is dangerous at night, and the class enemies might take advantage of the situation. They are all good successors of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and I have the responsibility to escort them. So, I held one by the hand and led them to the commune.

After the establishment of the brigade revolutionary leading group, some revolutionary youngsters felt that there was not much to do and reflected this to me. I thought that this was the responsibility of the leading group. As the person in charge of the leading group, I did not pay attention to mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the revolutionary youngsters, and I took on all the work, which made them feel that there was nothing to do. The leading group studied this problem and clearly defined that the revolutionary mass organizations should focus on three things: first, to study Chairman Mao's works; second, to carry out revolutionary criticism; and third, to supervise the work of the brigade production leading group. After clarifying these three tasks, the revolutionary youngsters became active again, and all the work was done well.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses, which has great significance for the ideological revolution of the entire Chinese people." The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary youngsters in our brigade have done a lot of work in the Cultural Revolution movement. Their general direction has always been correct. Their revolutionary spirit is worth learning from. The revolutionary spirit of the broad masses is the most precious gain of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Only the class enemies and some people with ulterior motives are afraid to death and hate to death the revolutionary spirit of the masses and will try every means to suppress and strike at the revolutionary spirit of the masses. "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support." We must pay attention to protecting and fully mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses and do our work better.

As long as the poor and lower-middle peasants need it, I will do it.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, active, and regard revolutionary interests as the first priority, and subordinate personal interests to revolutionary interests." During the period when the revolutionary masses were investigating me, I thought: I am a Communist Party member and also a commune member. No matter what time or in any difficult situation, I should do a good job and not let revolutionary interests suffer any loss. Therefore, I insisted on working with the commune members and pointed out problems when I saw them. The small cart for pushing soil was inefficient, so I suggested adjusting the labor force; the method of digging frozen soil was incorrect, so I suggested changing the method. During rest times, I also actively organized commune members to study Chairman Mao's works. Some commune members asked me, "Why do you still manage so many things?" Others advised me, "Do less, just work honestly!" I smiled and told them, "To be a good commune member of Chairman Mao, we all have the responsibility to manage the brigade's affairs together."

During the period when the revolutionary masses were investigating me, my wife was very happy. She had never wanted me to be a cadre, and now she thought I would no longer be a cadre. One day, she asked me, "Will you still be a cadre in the future?" I said, "As long as the Party and the poor and lower-middle peasants trust me, I will do whatever they ask me to do." My wife did not understand, so I studied Chairman Mao's works with her, recalled our bitter past, and awakened her class consciousness. I said, "Think carefully, if it were not for Chairman Mao saving us, how could we have been liberated and lived a good life? The masses elected me to be a cadre to hold the power for the poor and lower-middle peasants. If we poor and lower-middle peasants do not become cadres, who else will hold the power and become cadres?" My wife understood and no longer held me back.

After the investigation and criticism by the masses, most of the original brigade cadres were elected into the new leading group. One brigade cadre had not straightened out his thoughts and did not want to be a cadre anymore. I talked to him and studied the "Three Articles" with him. I said, "Now is not the time when you were begging for food and falling into the pit, nor is it the time when you were freezing and starving and going to the soup kitchen to beg for porridge. Now, your family has several large brick houses, several bags of grain, and a large pile of cotton quilts. Have you forgotten the hardships you suffered in the past? I think that if the country changes color, it will not be the poor and lower-middle peasants who elect you to be a cadre, but the landlords and rich peasants who will come to settle accounts with you." This comrade recalled his past bitter family history and the hard days when the poor and lower-middle peasants had no power, finally straightened out his thoughts, and participated in the brigade's revolutionary leading group.

After two years of the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I deeply felt that the revolutionary mass movement led by Chairman Mao is excellent! This movement, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, has exposed the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and has unearthed a handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hidden within the revolutionary ranks. It has smashed their plot to restore capitalism in China, consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, and this is a great and magnificent victory! At the same time, this movement is a severe test and education for every Party member and every cadre, a vivid political lesson of class struggle and line struggle. After this great storm and great spectacle of mass struggle, it washed away the dirt on my body, raised my awareness of socialist revolution, and only then could we, along with a large number of young cadres, carry the socialist revolution through to the end and do the work better. I have received profound education in this movement, but my transformation of world outlook is still far from sufficient. In the future, I will closely connect with the masses, study and apply Chairman Mao's works with the masses, and fight against selfishness. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I will achieve new merits.

### 革命的群众运动考验了我

    革命的群众运动考验了我
    北京市平谷县山东庄公社鱼子山大队　王进忠
    这是毛主席亲自领导的
    无产阶级文化大革命刚开始的时候，我对这场轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动很不理解。但是，我思想上坚信一条：这场文化大革命，是毛主席他老人家亲自发动和领导的，毛主席怎么说我就怎么干。在毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”上说：“党的领导敢不敢放手发动群众，将决定这场文化大革命的命运。”我是大队的党总支书记，应当怎样对待这场群众运动呢？我想起了毛主席的教导：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”我下定决心，一定要听毛主席的话，“敢”字当头，放手发动群众，在这场革命群众运动里，经受锻炼和考验。
    思想通了，我就在大队干部和社员群众大会上，和大家一起学习毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的指示，学习“十六条”，帮助大家认清文化大革命的意义。我向大家表示：我当了多年干部，肯定会有许多缺点和错误，希望大家揭发和批判，我自己也一定好好检查。为了给群众贴大字报提供方便条件，我还自己动手扎席棚，买纸。
    可是，对待群众运动的态度，并不是一下子就能解决的。群众发动起来了，革命的群众组织也建立了，给我提意见的大字报逐渐多起来。看到房里房外大字报贴满了墙，我心里挺不是滋味。心想，我王进忠贫农出身，从小就给地主放牛，是毛主席解放了我。当了二十多年干部，就是没有功劳，也有苦劳嘛！为什么群众对我有这样大的劲呢？特别是看到个别坏人故意给我捏造的“罪状”，心里就更恼火。这时，毛主席的教导在我耳边响了起来：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。”我仔细看看大字报的内容，绝大多数是革命小将、社员群众对我的热情帮助，少数大字报是由于群众不太了解情况，事实有些出入。坏人的造谣、诬蔑，只是个别的。有的贫下中农要我作些解释。我想，群众刚刚发动起来，给我提了点意见，自己就东一个解释，西一个说明，那还怎样进一步发动群众呢？我在鱼子山土生土长，群众对我最了解，我完全相信群众是会弄清事实的。大字报越多，越说明群众是发动起来了。毛主席号召我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”大家都听毛主席的话，主动关心国家大事了，这正是天大的好事。想到这里，我心里觉得特别高兴，工作也就抓得更紧。
    决不能让阶级敌人钻空子
    无产阶级文化大革命的烈火在鱼子山烧起来以后，阶级敌人妄想利用这个机会混水摸鱼。他们首先给我捏造了一些“罪状”，想挑动少数不明真相的人把我搞臭。大字报刚一贴出，贫下中农就看穿了他们的鬼把戏，纷纷贴大字报反击。
    一计不成，又生一计。有一天，在垫地劳动的时候，我正推车运土。一个地主分子装出一副关心我的样子，皮笑肉不笑地说：“还是少装点吧！别累着了。”我一听，火就上来了。这明明是黄鼠狼给鸡拜年，没安好心。我想起解放前给地主放牛那阵，每天天不亮就起来挑水，天一亮就上山放牛，光着脚爬山，脚被扎破了，鲜血直流，照样还得挑水干活；每天起早摸黑地干，连夜晚也不得休息，困得我解手的时候，一头栽倒在地上。在那吃人的旧社会里，你们这些吃人肉、喝人血的地主分子，哪个关心过我！现在，我更不会上你们的当！我就斩钉截铁地对他说：“老老实实装你的土！我现在怎么累，也没有给你们扛活的时候累。现在我是为社会主义干活，为人民出力，再累也心甘情愿。”
    这件事情提醒了我，我想：过去我们大队对没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子管制得很严，他们谁也不敢轻举妄动。现在，他们看见有些干部不管事了，革命小将没有经验，就一个个贼眉鼠眼，蠢蠢欲动，连说话的口气都变了。这说明阶级敌人想钻我们的空子。无产阶级文化大革命，是在无产阶级专政条件下进行的大革命，只能在人民内部实行民主，对阶级敌人时时刻刻都要专政。只许无产阶级革命派造反，决不许地、富、反、坏、右分子翻天。在一次劳动的时候，我就明确向四类分子宣布：“你们只有老老实实地劳动，接受人民的监督、改造，决不允许你们这些阶级敌人钻空子！”在广大贫下中农和革命小将的监督下，我们队的四类分子就不敢乱说乱动了。
    群众的革命精神要坚决保护
    我们大队的革命群众组织建立以后，革命小将遵照毛主席的教导，积极参加文化大革命，破四旧，立四新，对没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子实行专政。他们的革命行动，我都积极拥护。开始我只是觉得：无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，毛主席他老人家多次接见红卫兵和革命群众。毛主席支持的，我们就应该支持、拥护。
    以后，在和革命小将接触中，我才逐渐感到：他们有许多老干部没有的优点，从他们身上，可以学到很多宝贵的东西。有一件事对我教育很大：在一次批判我的大会上，一个富农分子的姐姐，专门从外村赶来参加，她跳上台去，胡说什么我给她弟弟划错了成份，妄图借机翻案。主持会议的革命小将识破了她的阴谋，立刻制止了她的发言，转身向群众问道：“她弟弟的成份是不是富农？”大家同声回答：“是！”又问：“她是不是给富农分子翻案？”大家又一致回答：“是！”于是，这个想为富农分子翻案的家伙，灰溜溜地被赶下了台去。革命小将坚定的阶级立场，爱憎分明的态度，深深教育了我，使我感动得流出了热泪。
    有一天，半夜里，紧急集合的哨音把我惊醒。我想，自己虽然没有参加群众组织，但我是共产党员，有责任和革命小将一起参加斗争。我急忙穿上衣服，跟在他们的后面往公社跑。半路上，有两个革命小将掉了队。我想：我们这里是山区，天黑路险，阶级敌人很可能乘机活动。他们都是贫下中农的好后代，我有责任护送他们。于是，我就一手拉着一个，一直把他们送到公社。
    大队革命领导班子成立以后，有些革命小将感到没有多少事可干了，听到这些反映，我觉得这是领导班子的责任。我是领导班子的负责人，没有注意发挥革命小将的革命积极性，什么工作都让干部包下了，才使他们觉得无事可作。领导班子研究了这个问题，明确了革命群众组织应该抓三件事：首先要抓毛主席著作的学习；其次是抓革命的大批判；第三是要监督大队生产领导班子的工作。明确了这三项任务，革命小将又活跃起来，几件工作都干得很好。
    毛主席教导我们：“这次运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”我们大队的贫下中农和革命小将，在文化大革命运动中做了大量的工作。他们的大方向始终是正确的。他们的革命精神很值得我学习。广大革命群众的这种革命精神，是无产阶级文化大革命最可贵的收获。只有阶级敌人和一些别有用心的人，才对群众的革命精神怕得要命，恨得要死，才会千方百计地压制和打击群众的革命精神。“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”。我们一定要注意保护和充分发挥广大群众的革命积极性，把我们的工作做得更好。
    只要贫下中农需要，我就干
    毛主席教导我们：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。在革命群众审查我的时候，我想：我是个共产党员，也是人民公社社员。无论什么时候，在任何困难的情况下，我都应该做好工作，决不能使革命利益受到损失。所以，我一直坚持和社员一起参加劳动，在劳动中，看到了问题我就提出来。推土的小车窝工了，我就建议调配劳动力；挖冻土的方法不当，就建议改变方法。休息时，我还积极组织社员学习毛主席著作。有的社员问我：“你怎么还管这么多事？”也有的人劝我：“少管点事，老老实实劳动吧！”我就笑着对他们说：“要做一个毛主席的好社员，我们大家都有责任共同管好队里的事情。”
    在革命群众审查我的期间，我老伴很高兴，她本来就不愿意我当干部，现在，她估计我再不会当干部了。有一天，她问我：“以后还当不当干部了？”我说：“只要党和贫下中农信任我，让我干什么就干什么。”老伴想不通，我就和她一起学习毛主席著作，一起忆苦思甜，启发她的阶级觉悟。我说：“你仔细想想，要不是毛主席搭救我们，我们那能翻身得解放，过上好日子？群众选我当干部，是让我替贫下中农掌握印把子。咱们贫下中农不当干部，难道还能让地主、富农来掌权、当干部？”我老伴想通了，再也不拖我的后腿了。
    经过群众的审查批判，原来的大队干部，大多数人选进了新的领导班子。有一个大队干部思想弯子没有扭过来，不愿意再当干部了。我就找他谈心，和他一起学习“老三篇”。我说：“现在不是你要饭摔在坑里的时候了，不是你挨冻受饿去粥棚要粥的时候了，现在，你家里有了几间大瓦房，粮食几口袋，花被子一大摞，你就忘了过去受的苦了。我看哪，要是国家改变了颜色，不是贫下中农选你当干部，该是地主、富农找你算账了。”这个同志想起了过去的血泪家史，想起了贫下中农没有权的苦日子，终于搞通了思想，参加了大队的革命领导班子。
    经过两年来轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动，我深深地感到：毛主席亲自领导的革命群众运动就是好得很！这次运动，广大工农兵革命群众和革命小将，在毛主席的革命路线指引下，揪出了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，挖出了隐藏在革命队伍内部的一小撮叛徒、特务和反革命分子，粉碎了他们妄想在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋，巩固了无产阶级专政，这是个了不起的伟大胜利！同时，这次运动对每个党员、每个干部都是一次严峻的考验和教育，一次生动的阶级斗争和路线斗争的政治课。经过这场群众斗争的大风雨、大世面，冲掉了身上的脏东西，提高了社会主义革命的自觉性，我们这些干部才能够和大批年青的干部一起，把社会主义革命进行到底，把工作搞得更好。我在这次运动中受到了深刻的教育，但是，自己的世界观改造得还很不够。今后，我一定密切联系群众，和群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗私心，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。
