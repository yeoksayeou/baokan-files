New Delhi, June 15 (Xinhua) - The Indian reactionary government recently mobilized a large number of troops to brutally suppress the Nagas and Mizos who are fighting for national liberation. The armed forces of these ethnic groups have bravely resisted, inflicting heavy casualties on the Indian military.

According to Indian bourgeois newspapers, on June 7, 8, and 10, near Kohima, the capital of Nagaland, Naga armed forces engaged in fierce battles with Indian reactionary troops. The British *Times* quoted an Indian reporter who had been to Nagaland as saying that about ninety Indian soldiers were killed, but the Indian authorities claimed only twenty-nine were killed.

Despite the Indian reactionary government's boasting about the "achievements" of its troops in the "sweeping" operations, it cannot hide its panic. After the battles, B. K. Nehru, who serves as both the Governor of Assam and Nagaland, hurried to Kohima to conspire with local military and political leaders on how to deal with the serious situation.

The Naga armed forces are overcoming difficulties and bravely fighting, inflicting more casualties on the enemy.

Meanwhile, the Indian reactionary troops have intensified their attacks on the Mizo armed forces. According to Indian bourgeois newspapers, on the night of June 10, Mizo armed forces engaged in a large-scale battle with Indian troops in the Mizo hills. They used mortars, machine guns, and automatic rifles to fiercely counterattack the Indian reactionary troops.

The recent armed attacks by the Indian reactionary government on the Nagas and Mizos are well-planned. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi revealed on May 10 to some reactionary party representatives that the central government would "provide the necessary manpower and resources" to strengthen the suppression of the Naga people's struggle. Subsequently, Indian Army Chief of Staff Kumar Mangalam secretly inspected and deployed troops in eastern India in late May.

It is worth noting that Indian revisionists have recently been quick to support the Indian reactionary rulers on the issue of Naga and Mizo armed struggles. They not only do not support these ethnic groups' armed struggles against national oppression and for national liberation but also propagate that the Indian Prime Minister is willing to "satisfy" the demands of these ethnic groups and agrees to establish an "autonomous hill unit" within Assam. These revisionists attempt to use such propaganda to help the Indian reactionary government weaken the fighting will of these ethnic armed forces and deceive them into laying down their arms.

However, whether it is armed suppression or political deception, it cannot stop the development of the armed struggles of the Nagas, Mizos, Kukis, and other ethnic groups. Their cause is just. Their struggle will surely achieve final victory.

### 那加、米佐族武装同印度反动政府军激战  印反动派策划加紧镇压，印修分子竭力为反动政府帮腔

    那加、米佐族武装同印度反动政府军激战
    印反动派策划加紧镇压，印修分子竭力为反动政府帮腔
    新华社十五日讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府最近出动大批军队，疯狂镇压为争取民族解放而斗争的那加、米佐族人民。这些民族的武装力量英勇抵抗，杀伤印军多人。
    据印度资产阶级报刊透露，六月七日、八日和十日，在那加邦首府科希马附近，那加武装接连同印度反动军队进行激战。英国《泰晤士报》引述到过那加邦的印度记者的报道说，印军被打死大约九十人，但印度官方却说只打死了二十九人。
    印度反动政府尽管大肆宣传它的军队在“扫荡”行动中取得“战果”，但是无法掩饰它的慌张情绪。在战斗发生之后，兼任那加邦邦长的阿萨姆邦邦长布·克·尼赫鲁十一日匆匆忙忙地赶到那加邦首府科希马，同当地军政头目密谋怎样对付严重的局势。
    那加武装力量正在克服困难，勇敢战斗，更多地消灭敌人的有生力量。
    同时，印度反动军队还加紧了对米佐武装力量的进攻。据印度资产阶级报刊透露，米佐武装力量十日晚间在米佐山区同印军进行大规模战斗。他们使用了迫击炮、机关枪和自动步枪，猛烈地向印度反动军队还击。
    印度反动政府最近对那加、米佐族的武装进攻，是蓄谋已久的。印度总理英迪拉·甘地五月十日就曾向一些反动政党代表透露，印度中央政府将“提供必要的人力和物资”，加强镇压那加人民的斗争。随后，印度陆军参谋长库马拉芒加兰五月下旬到印度东部地区进行了秘密的视察和部署。
    值得注意的是，印度修正主义分子最近在那加、米佐武装斗争的问题上赶忙为印度反动统治者帮腔。他们不但不支持这些民族反对民族压迫、争取民族解放的武装斗争，反而大肆宣传什么印度总理是愿意“满足”那些民族的“要求”的，是同意在阿萨姆邦内成立一个“自治的山区单位”的。这些修正主义分子妄想用这种宣传来帮助印度反动政府麻痹那些民族武装的战斗意志，诱骗他们放下武器。
    但是，不论武装镇压还是政治欺骗，都不能阻止那加、米佐、库基等民族武装斗争的发展。他们的事业是正义的。他们的斗争必将取得最后胜利。
