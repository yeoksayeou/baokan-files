Highly hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely defend the dictatorship of the proletariat! — Studying the Minutes of the Forum on Army Literature and Art Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing

Editor's Note: The Minutes of the Forum on Army Literature and Art Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing, which was published a year ago, is an important Marxist-Leninist document that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. As Comrade Lin Biao pointed out, it "uses Mao Zedong Thought to answer many major issues of the cultural revolution in the socialist period, which not only has great practical significance but also has far-reaching historical significance."

Chairman Mao teaches us that the proletariat must exercise dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in the superstructure, including in all cultural domains. The Minutes is a political manifesto and a call to arms for the proletariat to exercise dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in the cultural domain, and it is a powerful ideological weapon for the broad revolutionary masses to criticize the revisionist literary black line, expose the counter-revolutionary revisionists in the cultural sphere, and smash the bourgeois dictatorship in the cultural domain.

On the occasion of the first anniversary of the publication of the Minutes, we invited representatives from the capital's workers, peasants, soldiers, and some cultural units to hold a symposium. Below is a summary of the speeches.

A Document Shining with the Brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought

Representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the Air Force Art Troupe:

Representative of the Proletarian Revolutionaries of the Beijing Air Force Art Troupe:

The east wind is surging, and the red flag is flying. In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries, together with the broad revolutionary masses and the Red Guards, are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and warmly celebrate the first anniversary of the publication of the Minutes of the Forum on Army Literature and Art Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing. As we re-read this brilliant document, we feel extremely excited and especially close to it.

The Minutes points out: In the socialist period, there is a struggle between "two classes and two lines" on the cultural front, that is, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership on the cultural front. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the literary and art circles "were seized by a black line that is opposed to Chairman Mao's thoughts and is anti-party and anti-socialist." We must "resolutely carry out a socialist cultural revolution on the cultural front and thoroughly eliminate this black line." "After eliminating this black line, there will still be future black lines, and we will have to continue the struggle." Therefore, we need to make long-term and arduous efforts to use Mao Zedong Thought to severely criticize the bourgeoisie and carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

The brilliant Minutes is a revolutionary order issued by the proletarian headquarters with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core. It calls on the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses to carry out the proletarian cultural revolution, thoroughly expose and overthrow the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, and charge forward to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The brilliant Minutes is a powerful ideological weapon to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and smash the restoration of capitalism. It adheres to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, believes in the masses, relies on the masses, and enthusiastically supports and praises the revolutionary actions of the masses, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to further arm the proletarian revolutionaries.

Under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, over the past two years, we proletarian revolutionaries, with a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and a chest full of determination to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have taken Comrade Jiang Qing as our example, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely followed the direction of struggle indicated in the Minutes. We have always directed our spearhead at the most dangerous enemy of the proletariat in socialist conditions—the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. We have launched sustained and fierce attacks on them, smashed the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev hidden within our party, and foiled their evil plot to overthrow our proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism. Through the great criticism, we have further solidified the direction that literature and art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We are determined to perform for the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life, sing for the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life, and be propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought for life. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further study the Minutes, implement the Minutes, severely criticize and struggle against the bourgeois counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and use our guns and pens to fight for the defense and consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Must Occupy the Stage of Literature and Art

Tan Yuanshou (Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 1):

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." Whether literature and art serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers or a handful of exploiting classes is the dividing line between proletarian literature and art and bourgeois literature and art, and it is the focal point of the struggle between Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line.

For seventeen years, the struggle between the two classes and two lines in the literary and art circles has been fiercely waged in our Peking Opera Troupe No. 1.

The original Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 1 was a "key" cultural unit of the old Beijing Municipal Committee. The black hands of the big bureaucrat, big traitor, and counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen directly intervened in our troupe, recruiting and accepting traitors, and promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line. The handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and bourgeois reactionary "authorities" within the party seized our power. The original Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 1 was a forward position for the handful of capitalist roaders within the party to restore capitalism and create public opinion.

At this moment of thick fog, our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing came to our troupe, armed our minds with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, brightened our eyes, pointed out the direction for us to advance, and personally led us to fight against Peng Zhen and other counter-revolutionary revisionists and the literary black line they promoted. Finally, we created the revolutionary model opera "Sha Jia Bang." The eight revolutionary model operas personally cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing drove all the monsters and demons off the stage. From then on, the historical creators and masters of the state, the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, occupied the stage, and the great Mao Zedong Thought occupied the stage.

It was in this life-and-death struggle between the two classes that I, under the patient guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, woke up from the shackles of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line. I deeply realized: As an actor, my responsibility is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, and wholeheartedly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, making literature and art a tool for the proletariat to fight against the bourgeoisie, and a tool for the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the past, we ate the grains grown by peasants, wore the cloth woven by workers, and lived in the houses built by workers; the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army guarded our national defense for us, but we did not portray the workers, peasants, and soldiers, nor did we sing their praises. Instead, we poisoned the workers, peasants, and soldiers, which was a criminal act. Literature and art are tools of class struggle. If you do not serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, you serve a handful of exploiting classes. There is no middle ground. The biggest capitalist roaders and counter-revolutionary revisionists within the party, such as Zhou Yang, advocated what they called "national literature and art" and "indirect service theory," etc., all of which are deceitful talk. The practice of class struggle tells us: If the proletariat does not occupy the literary and art positions, the bourgeoisie will occupy them. To consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must firmly grasp the leadership of literature and art and never talk about "equality" with the representatives of the bourgeoisie!

Lu Liang (Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the unit where Comrade Men He died):

Our Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team was established in February last year. As soon as the team was established, we studied the Minutes and were greatly inspired.

Our country is a proletarian dictatorship, and workers, peasants, and soldiers are the masters of the political stage and the creators of history. They should also be the masters of the literary and art stage. We regard writing a good play and performing a good program as a manifestation of loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought and as a victory over the bourgeoisie. We are stationed in a highland area, and the members of the propaganda team are not afraid of hardship and fatigue. They go deep into the troops and bring Mao Zedong Thought and the deeds of heroic figures to the broad soldiers. In December last year, in the bitter cold of minus thirty degrees, we braved the wind and snow, crossed rivers and mountains, overcame numerous difficulties, and walked dozens of miles to finally complete the performance task.

In October last year, we accepted the task of propagating the heroic deeds of Comrade Men He. Comrade Men He is a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. His heroic deeds are outstanding, and his ideological level is high. Performing heroes is also a good opportunity to learn heroes and Mao Zedong Thought. Through rehearsing the program, we further felt that the heroes nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought have lofty qualities. We decided to write the program overnight and better complete this task of propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

With hearts full of infinite love for the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, we came to the capital and once again studied "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and the Minutes. We were once again greatly inspired. We are determined and confident to propagate Mao Zedong Thought better and to combine the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought with the learning of Comrade Men He's noble qualities.

Li Hongjun (Beijing Air Force Unit):

The literary and art front, as Vice Chairman Lin said, "If the proletariat does not occupy it, the bourgeoisie will necessarily occupy it. The struggle is inevitable. This is an extremely broad and profound socialist revolution in the ideological realm, and if it is not done well, revisionism will emerge." Therefore, the struggle for the literary and art front is essentially a struggle to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat and smash the restoration of capitalism. Every soldier in our army should firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, adhere to the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and fight for the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In May last year, the unit's party committee asked us to learn the form of clay sculpture "The Opium Den" and use clay sculpture to depict the family histories of six comrades in our unit who have deep bitterness and hatred. This was to conduct class education for the unit and promote the ideological revolution of the unit.

None of us had studied painting, let alone sculpture. We had only heard that sculpture is the "peak of fine arts," the "most difficult fortress to attack," and that one must study for six years to graduate. Given this situation, could we, who are armed with guns, complete this glorious political task? At first, everyone was a bit hesitant. With this question in mind, we re-studied the Minutes. The Minutes said: We must strive to create heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is the fundamental task of socialist literature and art; we must create good models to firmly occupy the literary and art front; it also pointed out: "On this issue, we should not have an inferiority complex but should have a sense of pride."

The instructions in the Minutes gave us great encouragement.

What is the "peak of fine arts," the "most difficult fortress to attack," and that one must study for six years to graduate... all of these are the bourgeoisie's scare tactics against the proletariat, aiming to occupy the sculpture front and use it as a bridgehead to attack the proletariat. Can we allow the bourgeoisie to continue to occupy this front? No, we cannot allow it! History is created by us workers, peasants, and soldiers. We not only want to occupy the political stage but must also occupy the literary and art stage, making literature and art a powerful weapon to "unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy." If we do not occupy this front, it is to give up class struggle, which is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. We solemnly vow: For the sake of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we will definitely occupy the sculpture front!

We followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "learning war from war," learning and sculpting at the same time. If we didn't know something, we would ask the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary sculptors for help. To create a clear-cut image of the laboring people, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching and, while transforming the objective world, strove to transform the subjective world. We conducted several activities of recalling bitterness and comparing the old and new, arousing hatred for the class enemy and increasing love for the new society and the laboring people. After three months of struggle, we finally created eight groups of twenty-five life-sized clay sculptures, including "Fleeing from Famine" and "Being Harmed," and conquered the sculpture front, which was once considered by the bourgeois "authorities" to be an "off-limits" area for workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Deeply and Persistently Carry Out the Revolutionary Great Criticism

Dai Dehai, Ma Dezhi (Beijing-China Friendship Commune):

Zhao Yongfang, Wang Jiali (Beijing Red Star Commune):

Our society is a proletarian dictatorship, and our literature and art should also be proletarian literature and art. However, since the founding of the People's Republic of China, many strange things have happened in the literary and art circles.

As early as twenty-six years ago, Chairman Mao instructed us that literature and art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Why, after sixteen or seventeen years of the founding of the People's Republic of China, does literature and art not portray the protagonists of the socialist era, the workers and peasants, but only build monuments for emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beauties, and sing praises for the bourgeois lords and ladies? Why not propagate the lifeblood of the poor and lower-middle peasants, Mao Zedong Thought, but peddle the goods of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism?

As early as twenty-six years ago, Chairman Mao taught us that to defeat the enemy, we still need a cultural army. Why, after sixteen or seventeen years of the founding of the People's Republic of China, are those who rule the literary and art circles still the "ancestors" of the 1930s literature and art, the bourgeois reactionary "authorities," as well as traitors, spies, and reactionary writers of the Kuomintang, while the workers, peasants, and soldiers are excluded or only used as decorations?

As early as twenty-six years ago, Chairman Mao thoroughly exposed and criticized the various strange theories of the bourgeoisie and revisionism. Why, over the past sixteen or seventeen years, have these fallacies of the bourgeoisie, which were once condemned by Chairman Mao, been able to resurface and poison the masses?

In a proletarian dictatorship, in a country where workers, peasants, and soldiers are the masters, literature and art do not serve proletarian politics, do not serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. There is a ghost here. Where is the ghost? The Minutes pointed out in a penetrating way that originally, the literary and art circles "were seized by a black line that is opposed to Chairman Mao's thoughts and is anti-party and anti-socialist."

Some people say, "There is a ghost, but it is harmless." We say, the ghost that seized the literary and art circles is very harmful! Literature and art are very powerful weapons. For our proletarian dictatorship, they either play a consolidating role or a destructive role. "The sky changes first, and people change first. People change first, and their minds change first." The overthrown landlords and bourgeoisie want to change the sky, often starting from changing people and changing their minds, and in the struggle to change people and change their minds, literature and art are their most effective tools. Therefore, if we give up the struggle, allow the bourgeoisie to attack us, and allow poisonous weeds to spread, then our proletarian regime may be seized by the bourgeoisie.

The class struggle on the literary and art front, like the class struggle in the entire ideological and cultural realm, is either the proletariat suppressing the bourgeoisie or the bourgeoisie suppressing the proletariat, with no middle ground to take. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have achieved great victories on the literary and art front. However, it must be seen that the struggle is long-term, complex, and fierce. Therefore, we must continue to deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary great criticism, severely criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents in the literary and art circles, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line they promoted, and resolutely eliminate all kinds of anti-party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds they concocted.

Zhang Baosheng (Beijing Yongding Machinery Factory):

Grasp the fundamentals and criticize the key points. To carry out the revolutionary great criticism, we must start from the major issues of the struggle between the two lines.

The Minutes pointed out: In the struggle against foreign revisionism in literature and art, "we must catch the big ones, catch Sholokhov, and dare to confront him." We understand that "catching the big ones" means catching the representative figures of revisionist literature and art, criticizing their representative viewpoints, and denouncing their representative works.

According to the instructions of the Minutes: "Catch the big ones," after our literary and art criticism group was established, we took up the weapon of criticism and fired at the big figures of Soviet revisionist literature and art, Sholokhov, Simonov, and Ehrenburg, and attacked their long and stinking representative works "And Quiet Flows the Don," "Day and Night," and "The Thaw." We do not have the "sophisticated" theories of the bourgeois authorities, but we understand a truth: What serves the proletariat is good, and what serves the bourgeoisie is bad; what praises the workers, peasants, and soldiers is beautiful, and what denies the workers, peasants, and soldiers is ugly. With this in mind, we saw through these "big figures," and their backsides were all stamped with the word "revisionism"; we saw through these works, and these so-called "classics" were full of the three words "counter-revolution."

According to the instructions of the Minutes: "Catch the big ones," we took up the weapon of criticism and fiercely fired at the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the party and their agents in the literary and art circles, and fiercely fired at the various poisonous weeds they concocted, such as "Sparkling," "Stormy Waves," and "Defending Yan'an." We held symposiums, published wall newspapers and bulletin boards to expose their crimes. We used all forms and opportunities to propagate, just to expose those bad, ugly, and black revisionist goods to the public and thoroughly denounce them among the masses. Only in this way can we eliminate the poison of bourgeois ideology among the masses, and Mao Zedong Thought can take deep root in the minds of the masses.

Representative of the "Donghong" Literary and Art Criticism Group of Beijing Electron Tube Factory:

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses. Only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." To carry out the revolutionary great criticism, we must also fully mobilize the masses and wage a "people's war."

In the past, our literary criticism was monopolized by a few bourgeois critics. They talked about Belinsky and "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons," seeming to be very learned. In fact, their knowledge was just to scare people with a set of obscure terms and to pressure people with the posture of "authority"; their ability was just to praise the goods of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism and to cut down the works of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The monopoly of literary criticism by the bourgeoisie must not continue!

The Minutes pointed out: "We must advocate revolutionary, combative, and mass literary criticism... and hand over the weapon of literary criticism to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers." We must disarm the bourgeois critics and seize back the power of literary criticism. We have the qualifications and are fully capable of wielding the weapon of literary criticism!

Once the weapon of literary criticism is in the hands of workers, peasants, and soldiers, a completely new situation will emerge.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers all become critics, and we can break through any attack of bourgeois ideology, while the bourgeoisie cannot break through us.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers all become critics, seeing poisonous weeds and weeding them out, seeing wrong ideas and criticizing them, thus building an iron wall to prevent and resist revisionism in ideology.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers all become critics, and we can effectively fight against all ideological forms of the exploiting classes and establish a powerful proletarian dictatorship in the ideological and cultural realm!

Establish a Revolutionary Literary and Art Team

Wang Guohua, Xue Jinghua (Beijing Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Ballet Troupe):

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, we are thoroughly eliminating the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line promoted by China's Khrushchev. Through two years of fierce struggle, we have achieved great victories. However, class struggle is still very sharp and complex, as the Minutes said: "After eliminating this black line, there will still be future black lines, and we will have to continue the struggle."

The class enemies will not willingly accept their annihilation. They have adopted a series of conspiracies and tricks, sharpening their heads to infiltrate our revolutionary ranks. They wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, spreading the evil wind of rightist reversal, attempting to restore the rule of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line. At the crucial moment of struggle, it was the instructions of our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing and the spirit of the Minutes that made us see through the ugly faces of a handful of class enemies, guiding us broad revolutionary masses to launch fierce attacks on them and expose them one by one.

For more than a decade, the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line has been deeply poisonous in the literary and art circles. Many of our comrades in the literary and art team have been poisoned to varying degrees. It was Comrade Jiang Qing who held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, liberating us from the old fortresses of capitalism and revisionism, such as princesses and princes, and letting us participate in the great ballet revolution, walking on the path of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Through continuous study of the Minutes and other important documents and participation in actual class struggle, we realized that the bourgeois ideology in our minds has not been thoroughly eliminated. If we do not thoroughly criticize and denounce a handful of class enemies in ideology and politics, if we do not thoroughly criticize and expose the black backer of China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line he promoted, if we do not arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, then our victory will not be consolidated, and the restoration of capitalism may occur at any time. We are determined to, in this great revolution that touches people's souls, use Mao Zedong Thought and the Minutes as weapons, criticize and denounce "revisionism" and "selfishness," and let Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line firmly take root in the minds of each of us.

Chen Wanying (Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 1):

The Minutes raised the issue of re-educating literary and art cadres and reorganizing the literary and art team. What kind of literary and art team do we want to build? The Minutes clearly stated: "We must long-term and deeply integrate with life, combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, raise class consciousness, transform thoughts, seek no fame, seek no gain, and wholeheartedly serve the people. We must educate our comrades to read Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's books for life, and rebel for life." We will follow the direction proposed in the Minutes, strive to transform our thoughts, and train ourselves to be red literary and art warriors who are forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and wholeheartedly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Our troupe, under the control of the old Propaganda Department, the old Culture Department, and the old Beijing Municipal Committee, performed emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beauties for a long time, poisoning the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Although we are young actors, as the Minutes said: "Many of our literary and art workers were educated and trained by the bourgeoisie," therefore, in the revolutionary great criticism and the establishment of the revolutionary team, on the one hand, we must fiercely attack the class enemies, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line backed by China's Khrushchev, and clean out the handful of class enemies who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks; on the other hand, we must also draw a clear line with bourgeois ideology, eliminate the poison of the literary black line, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and forever serve proletarian politics, serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought for life.

### 高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决捍卫无产阶级专政！——学习《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决捍卫无产阶级专政！
    ——学习《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》
    编者按：一年前公开发表的《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的马克思列宁主义的重要文献。正如林彪同志指出的，它“用毛泽东思想回答了社会主义时期文化革命的许多重大问题，不仅有极大的现实意义，而且有深远的历史意义。”
    毛主席教导我们，无产阶级必须在上层建筑其中包括在各个文化领域对资产阶级实行专政。《纪要》就是无产阶级在文化领域里向资产阶级实行专政的政治宣言书和战斗动员令，也是广大革命群众批判修正主义文艺黑线、揭露文化界的反革命修正主义分子和摧毁文化领域资产阶级专政的强大思想武器。
    在纪念《纪要》公开发表一周年的时候，我们邀请首都工农兵以及文艺单位的部分代表举行了座谈会，下面是发言摘要。
    闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的文献
    空政文工团革命委员会代表：
    北京空军文工团无产阶级革命派代表：
    东风浩荡，红旗招展。在无产阶级文化大革命的阵阵凯歌声中，我们无产阶级革命派同广大革命群众和红卫兵小将一起，满怀革命的激情，热烈欢庆《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》发表一周年。我们重温《纪要》这一光辉文献，感到无比兴奋和特别亲切。
    《纪要》指出：在社会主义阶段，文化战线上存在着“两个阶级、两条路线的斗争，即无产阶级和资产阶级在文化战线上争夺领导权的斗争。”中华人民共和国成立以后，文艺界“被一条与毛主席思想相对立的反党反社会主义的黑线专了我们的政”。我们必须“坚决进行一场文化战线上的社会主义大革命，彻底搞掉这条黑线。”“搞掉这条黑线之后，还会有将来的黑线，还得再斗争。”所以，我们需要作长期的、艰苦的努力，用毛泽东思想狠批资产阶级，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    光辉的《纪要》，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级司令部发出来的革命号令。它号召无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，开展无产阶级文化大革命，彻底揭露和打倒党内一小撮走资派，为巩固无产阶级专政而冲锋前进。
    光辉的《纪要》，是巩固无产阶级专政、粉碎资本主义复辟的强大思想武器。它坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，相信群众，依靠群众，热情地支持和歌颂群众的革命行动，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想把无产阶级革命派进一步武装起来。
    在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，两年来，我们无产阶级革命派，对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想胸怀一个“用”字，以敬爱的江青同志为榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决按照《纪要》所指示的斗争方向，始终把矛头对准社会主义条件下无产阶级最危险的敌人——党内一小撮走资派，向他们发动了持续的猛烈的进攻，摧毁了隐藏在我们党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，粉碎了他们妄图颠覆我国无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。通过革命的大批判，我们进一步坚定了文艺必须为工农兵服务的方向，决心为工农兵演一辈子，为工农兵唱一辈子，做一辈子毛泽东思想的宣传员。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步学习《纪要》，贯彻《纪要》，狠批狠斗资产阶级反革命修正主义路线，用我们的枪杆子和笔杆子，为保卫和巩固无产阶级专政而战斗！
    工农兵一定要占领文艺舞台
    谭元寿（北京京剧一团）：
    毛主席教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”文艺究竟是为工农兵服务，还是为一小撮剥削阶级服务？这是无产阶级文艺同资产阶级文艺的分水岭，是毛主席的革命文艺路线同反革命修正主义文艺黑线斗争的焦点。
    十七年来，文艺界两个阶级、两条路线的斗争，在我们京剧一团一直激烈地进行着。
    原北京京剧一团是旧北京市委的“重点”文艺单位，大党阀、大叛徒、反革命修正主义分子彭真的黑手直接插到我团来，在我团招降纳叛，推行了一条反革命修正主义文艺黑线。党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务和资产阶级反动“权威”专了我们的政。原北京京剧一团是为党内最大的一小撮走资派复辟资本主义制造舆论的一个前哨据点。
    在这妖雾弥漫的时刻，我们敬爱的江青同志来到我们一团，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装了我们的头脑，擦亮了我们的眼睛，指明了我们前进的方向，并亲自率领我们和彭真等反革命修正主义分子以及他们所推行的文艺黑线进行冲杀搏斗，终于创造出革命样板戏《沙家浜》。江青同志亲手培植的八个革命样板戏，把那些牛鬼蛇神统统赶下了舞台。从此，历史的创造者，国家的主人工农兵英雄形象占领了舞台，伟大的毛泽东思想占领了舞台。
    我就是在这场两个阶级的生死大搏斗中，在江青同志的谆谆教导之下才猛醒过来，从反革命修正主义文艺黑线的束缚下解放出来的。我深深认识到：作为一个演员的职责，就是要宣传毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，就是要全心全意地为工农兵服务，使文艺成为无产阶级向资产阶级进行斗争的工具，成为无产阶级专政的工具。过去，我们吃着农民种的粮食，穿着工人织的布，住着工人盖的房子；解放军战士为我们守卫着祖国的国防，而我们却不表现工农兵，不歌颂工农兵，相反地去毒害工农兵，这是一种犯罪的行为。文艺是阶级斗争的工具，你不为工农兵服务，便为一小撮剥削阶级服务，中间道路是没有的。党内最大的走资派和反革命修正主义分子周扬等鼓吹什么“全民文艺”，什么“间接服务”论，等等，统统是欺人之谈。阶级斗争的实践告诉我们：文艺阵地无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就会去占领。为了巩固无产阶级专政，我们一定要牢牢掌握住文艺领导大权，决不能和资产阶级的代表人物讲什么“平等”！
    罗良（门合同志生前所在部队毛泽东思想宣传队）：
    我们毛泽东思想宣传队是去年二月成立的。宣传队一成立，我们就学习了《纪要》，受到了很大的鼓舞。
    我们的国家是无产阶级专政的国家，工农兵是政治舞台的主人，是历史的创造者，也应当是文艺舞台的主人。我们把写好一个戏，演好一个节目，当作忠于毛泽东思想的表现，当作对资产阶级打了一场胜仗。我们地处高原，宣传队的同志们不怕艰苦疲劳，深入部队，把毛泽东思想和英雄人物事迹带给广大战士。去年十二月，在零下三十度的严寒天气，我们顶风冒雪，过河翻山，克服重重困难，步行几十里，终于胜利完成了演出任务。
    去年十月，我们接受了宣传门合同志英雄事迹的任务。门合同志是无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部，他的英雄事迹很突出，思想境界很高。演英雄也是学英雄、学毛泽东思想的好机会。通过排演节目，使我们进一步体会到毛泽东思想哺育起来的英雄，具有崇高的品质，我们决心连夜编写节目，更好地完成这一宣传毛泽东思想的战斗任务。
    我们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席、对毛泽东思想的无限热爱的心情来到首都，又一次学习了《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和《纪要》，又一次受到极大鼓舞，我们有决心、有信心把毛泽东思想宣传得更好，把宣传毛泽东思想和学习门合同志的高贵品质结合起来。
    李红军（北京部队空军某部）：
    文艺这个阵地，正象林副主席说的，“无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就必然去占领，斗争是不可避免的。这是在意识形态领域里极为广泛、深刻的社会主义革命，搞不好就会出修正主义。”因此，争夺文艺阵地的斗争，本质上就是一场保卫无产阶级专政，粉碎资本主义复辟的斗争。我们解放军每个指战员，都应该坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，坚持文艺为工农兵服务的方向，为巩固无产阶级专政而斗争。
    去年五月，部队党委要我们几个同志去学习泥塑《收租院》的形式，把我们部队苦大仇深的六位同志的家史，用泥塑表现出来，向部队进行阶级教育，促进部队的思想革命化。
    我们几个人中间，谁都没有学过绘画，更没有学过雕塑，倒听说过雕塑是“美术的尖端”、“最难攻的堡垒”、“要上六年大学才能毕业”。根据这一情况，我们这些拿枪杆子的能不能完成这一光荣的政治任务？开始大伙心里都有点发怵。带着这个问题，我们重新学习了《纪要》。《纪要》中说：要努力塑造工农兵的英雄人物，这是社会主义文艺的根本任务；要搞出好样板，才能巩固地占领文艺阵地；还指出：“在这个问题上，不要有自卑感，而应当有自豪感。”
    《纪要》的这些指示，给了我们巨大的鼓舞力量。
    什么雕塑是“美术的尖端”“最难攻的堡垒”，什么“要上六年大学才能毕业”……统统都是资产阶级吓唬无产阶级的鬼话，目的是想占着雕塑这个阵地不放，把它作为进攻无产阶级的桥头堡。能容许资产阶级继续占领这个阵地吗？不，决不能容许！历史是我们工农兵创造的，我们工农兵不但要占领政治舞台，还必须占领文艺舞台，使文艺成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的有力武器。如果我们不去占领这个阵地，就是放弃阶级斗争，就是对毛主席最大的不忠。我们庄严地宣誓：为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，雕塑这个阵地，我们占定了！
    我们遵照毛主席“从战争学习战争”的教导，边学边塑，不懂，就向广大工农兵群众和革命的雕塑工作者请教。为了能塑造出爱憎分明的劳动人民的高大形象，我们遵照毛主席的教导，在改造客观世界的同时，努力改造主观世界，多次进行忆苦思甜，新旧对比的活动，激发对阶级敌人的仇恨，增强对新社会、对劳动人民的热爱。经过三个月的战斗，终于塑造出《逃荒》《被害》等八组共二十五个真人大小的泥塑群像，攻克了雕塑这个一向被资产阶级“权威”们认为工农兵是无法攀越的“禁地”。
    深入持久地展开革命的大批判
    戴德海、马德志（北京中阿友好公社）：
    赵永芳、王嘉礼（北京红星公社）：
    我们的社会是无产阶级专政的社会，按理说，我们的文艺也应当是无产阶级的文艺。可是中华人民共和国成立以来，文艺界却出现了许多咄咄怪事。
    早在二十六年前，毛主席就指示我们，文艺必须为工农兵服务。为什么中华人民共和国成立十六、七年了，文艺却不表现社会主义时代的主人公工农兵，光为帝王将相、才子佳人立牌坊，为资产阶级老爷太太唱赞歌，为什么不宣传我们贫下中农的命根子毛泽东思想，光贩卖封、资、修那套货色？
    早在二十六年前，毛主席就教导我们，为了战胜敌人，我们还要有一支文化的军队。为什么中华人民共和国成立十六、七年了，在文艺界称王称霸的还是那些三十年代文艺的祖师爷、资产阶级反动“权威”，以及叛徒、特务、国民党反动文人，而工农兵却被排斥在门外，或者只是作个点缀？
    早在二十六年前，毛主席就对资产阶级、修正主义的种种奇谈怪论，进行了无情的揭露和彻底的批判。为什么十六、七年来，这些早为毛主席痛斥过的资产阶级的谬论，又能重新泛起，毒害群众？
    无产阶级专政的国家，工农兵当家作主的国家，文艺却不为无产阶级政治服务，不为工农兵服务，这里有鬼。鬼在哪里？《纪要》一针见血地指出了，原来文艺界“被一条与毛主席思想相对立的反党反社会主义的黑线专了我们的政”。
    有人说，有鬼无害。我们说，文艺界被黑线专了政，这个“鬼”有害得很！文艺是个非常厉害的武器，对于我们的无产阶级专政，它不是起巩固的作用，就是起破坏的作用。“变天先变人，变人先变心”，被推翻的地主资产阶级要变天，往往是从变人变心开始的，而在变人变心的斗争中，文艺是他们最得力的工具。因此，如果我们放弃斗争，听任资产阶级向我们进攻，听任毒草泛滥，那么我们的无产阶级政权，就有可能被资产阶级夺去。
    文艺战线上的阶级斗争，同整个思想文化领域里的阶级斗争一样，不是无产阶级压倒资产阶级，就是资产阶级压倒无产阶级，没有中间的道路可走。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们在文艺战线上取得了很大的胜利。但是，必须看到，斗争还是长期的、复杂的、激烈的。因此，我们必须继续深入持久地展开革命的大批判，狠狠地批判中国赫鲁晓夫和他在文艺界的代理人，彻底批判他们所推行的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，坚决铲除他们所炮制的各种反党反社会主义的毒草。
    张宝申（北京永定机械厂）：
    抓要抓住根本，批要批在要害。展开革命的大批判，必须从两条路线斗争的大是大非出发。
    《纪要》指出：文艺上反对外国修正主义的斗争，“要捉大的，捉肖洛霍夫，要敢于碰他。”我们体会，“要捉大的”，就是要捉住修正主义文艺的代表人物，批判他们的代表论点，搞臭他们的代表作品。
    根据《纪要》的指示：“要捉大的”，我们文艺批判组成立以后，就拿起批判的武器，向苏修文艺的赫赫“大人物”肖洛霍夫、西蒙诺夫、爱伦堡开火，向他们又长又臭的代表作《静静的顿河》、《日日夜夜》、《解冻》进攻。我们没有资产阶级权威那套“高妙”的理论，但是我们懂得一个真理：为无产阶级服务的，就是好的，为资产阶级服务的，就是坏的；歌颂工农兵的，就是美的，否定工农兵的，就是丑的。凭着这一点，我们看穿了这些“大人物”，他们的屁股上盖的都是“修”字的印章；看穿了这些作品，这些所谓“名著”，满篇都是“反革命”三个大字。
    根据《纪要》的指示：“要捉大的”，我们就拿起批判的武器，向党内最大的一小撮走资派和他们在文艺界的代理人猛烈开火，向他们炮制的各种毒草《燎原》、《怒潮》、《保卫延安》猛烈开火。我们开座谈会，出墙报、壁报揭露他们的罪行。我们利用一切形式、一切机会进行宣传，就是要把那些坏的、丑的、黑的修正主义货色，统统公诸于众，在群众中彻底搞臭。只有这样，才能清除资产阶级思想在群众中的流毒，毛泽东思想才能在群众的头脑里牢牢扎根。
    北京电子管厂“东红”文艺批判组代表：
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”开展革命的大批判，同样必须充分发动群众，打一场“人民战争”。
    过去，我们的文艺批评，被少数资产阶级批评家把持着。他们张口别林斯基，闭口《文心雕龙》，看起来似乎满有学问。其实，他们的学问，就是会拿了一套玄而又玄的术语吓人，摆出“权威”的架势压人；他们的能耐，就是会对封、资、修的货色大吹特吹，对工农兵的作品大砍大杀。资产阶级垄断文艺批评的局面再也不能继续下去了！
    《纪要》指出：“要提倡革命的战斗的群众性的文艺批评，……把文艺批评的武器交给广大工农兵群众去掌握”。我们要缴掉资产阶级批评家的械，把文艺批评的大权夺回来。我们有资格、也完全有能力把文艺批评的武器掌握起来！
    文艺批评的武器一旦掌握在工农兵手里，就会出现前所未有的崭新局面。
    广大工农兵群众都做批评家，我们就能打破资产阶级思想的任何进攻，而资产阶级却打不破我们。
    广大工农兵群众都做批评家，见毒草就锄，见错误的思想就批，这样就能在思想上建筑一道防修反修的钢铁长城。
    广大工农兵群众都做批评家，就能有效地同一切剥削阶级的意识形态进行斗争，在思想文化领域里建立起强大的无产阶级专政！
    建立一支革命化的文艺队伍
    王国华、薛菁华（北京工农兵芭蕾舞剧团）：
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，正在彻底搞掉中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义文艺黑线。通过两年来的激烈斗争，我们已经取得了伟大的胜利。但是，阶级斗争还是十分尖锐和复杂的，正如《纪要》中所说：“搞掉这条黑线之后，还会有将来的黑线，还得再斗争。”
    阶级敌人是不会甘心于自己的灭亡的，他们采取了一系列的阴谋诡计，削尖了脑袋混进了我们的革命队伍内部。他们打着“红旗”反红旗，大刮右倾翻案的妖风，妄图重新恢复反革命修正主义文艺黑线的统治。在斗争的关键时刻，是我们敬爱的江青同志的指示和《纪要》的精神，使我们识破了一小撮阶级敌人的丑恶嘴脸，指引我们广大革命群众向他们展开了猛烈的进攻，把他们一个个地揪了出来。
    十几年来，反革命修正主义文艺黑线在文艺界流毒极广，影响极深，我们文艺队伍中的很多同志都程度不同地受到了毒害。是江青同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把我们从公主、王子的资本主义、修正主义的旧堡垒中解放了出来，让我们参加了伟大的芭蕾舞革命，走上了为工农兵服务的大道。通过不断的学习《纪要》等重要文件和参加实际的阶级斗争，我们认识到自己头脑里的资产阶级思想还远远没有肃清，如果我们不把一小撮阶级敌人从思想上、政治上彻底批倒批臭，不把包庇他们的黑后台中国赫鲁晓夫，以及他所推行的反革命修正主义文艺黑线批深批透，不用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，那么我们的胜利是不能巩固的，资本主义复辟将是随时可能发生的。我们决心在这场触及人们灵魂的大革命中，以毛泽东思想、《纪要》为武器，批倒“修”字，斗臭“私”字，让毛主席的革命文艺路线牢牢地在我们每个人的头脑里扎下根。
    陈婉蓉（北京京剧一团）：
    《纪要》中提出了重新教育文艺干部，重新组织文艺队伍的问题。我们究竟要树立什么样的文艺队伍呢？在《纪要》中已经明确提出：“要长期深入生活，和工农兵相结合，提高阶级觉悟，改造思想，不为名，不为利，全心全意地为人民服务。要教育我们的同志，读一辈子马克思列宁主义的书、毛主席的书，革一辈子命。”我们要按照《纪要》提出的方向，努力改造思想，把自己锻炼成为永远忠于毛泽东思想，全心全意为工农兵服务的红色文艺战士。
    我们剧团在旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委的控制下，长期演出帝王将相、才子佳人，向广大工农兵放了不少毒。我们虽然是青年演员，但正象《纪要》中所说的：“我们的许多文艺工作者，是受资产阶级的教育培养起来的”，因此，我们在革命大批判和树立革命队伍中，一方面要猛烈地向阶级敌人开火，彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为总后台的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，把一小撮混进革命队伍内部的阶级敌人清理出去；一方面也要同资产阶级思想划清界线，肃清文艺黑线的流毒，用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来，永远为无产阶级政治服务，为广大工农兵服务，宣传一辈子毛泽东思想。
