Arab countries are closely watching Israel's military provocations. The U.S. imperialist puppet Israel has deployed 70,000 troops along the West Bank of the Jordan River, intensifying its invasion preparations. Dayan arrogantly boasts of "unifying" the Arab territories it has occupied.

BEIJING, June 20 — According to reports from Cairo newspapers, Israeli aggressor troops continue to amass in the Jordan River West Bank valley region, now totaling 70,000. Meanwhile, Israeli forces are being moved towards the occupied Syrian Golan Heights and Jordanian territory of Qursa. The Egyptian weekly *Al-Ruz Al-Yusuf* revealed on June 17 that Israeli Defense Minister Dayan has drafted a new plan to seize the East Bank of the Jordan River.

The report states that Israel has recently deployed four divisions to the Jordan River West Bank valley, including two infantry divisions, one armored division, and one artillery division. Additionally, a rocket unit has been deployed. Israeli forces have also installed ground-to-ground missiles at bases in the Golan Heights. At the same time, Israeli aggressor troops conducted a series of "military exercises" in the Sinai Peninsula, with Chief of Staff Bar-Lev personally participating in these exercises.

These military activities by Israeli forces have alerted Arab countries. Jordanian military officials announced that Jordanian troops and Iraqi forces stationed in Jordan are on high alert. An Egyptian government spokesman also said that Egypt is seriously monitoring the Israeli troop buildup on the West Bank of the Jordan River.

Israeli Defense Minister Dayan recently raved that the current situation "will continue for a long time, and Israel should continue to implement its policies on the territories it controls." He also threatened that Israel "must forever hold onto Sharm el-Sheikh."

According to reports from Tel Aviv, Dayan also boasted to Labor Party members in the Israeli parliament that Israel will "unify" the Arab territories it has occupied since the June 1967 war, including lands from the coast to the Jordan River valley.

Reports indicate that Israel has been acting arrogantly recently because it has received political backing from U.S. imperialism and further military aid from its American masters.

It was precisely during and after the visit of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Davis to Israel on June 16 for a so-called "fact-finding" mission that Israel brazenly threatened its neighboring Arab countries with armed force.

The Cairo *Al-Jumhuriya* newspaper revealed on June 17 that Israel has recently received "Phantom" aircraft from the United States, some of which have already been deployed in Israeli-occupied areas.

While intensifying troop deployments and movements, Israel continues to provoke military incidents against Jordan and Egypt.

According to a Jordanian military spokesman in Amman, on June 20 and 17, Israeli aggressor troops attacked the Jordanian villages of Bakura and Adasiya in the northern Jordan River valley with machine guns and mortars. Jordanian forces retaliated. Additionally, Israeli and Jordanian forces engaged in artillery battles at the Damia Bridge over the Jordan River on June 20.

On the night of June 17, Israeli aggressor troops shelled Jordanian forces at Umm Sidr with artillery, and Jordanian forces retaliated.

Israeli aggressor troops have recently provoked Egypt again. On June 18, Israeli forces fired on Egyptian troops near Kantara, north of the Suez Canal, killing five Egyptian officers and soldiers.

    阿拉伯国家密切注视以色列的军事挑衅
    美帝走狗以色列在约旦河西岸陈兵七万加紧侵略部署
    达扬猖狂叫嚣要把侵占的阿拉伯领土“统一”起来
    新华社二十日讯　据开罗报纸报道：以色列侵略军继续在约旦河西岸河谷地区集结，现已达七万人。与此同时，以色列军队正向被占领的叙利亚戈兰高地和约旦领土古尔萨非方面调动。阿联《鲁兹·优素福》周刊十七日透露，以色列国防部长达扬已拟定了一项妄图侵占约旦河东岸的“新计划”。
    消息说，以色列最近向约旦河西岸河谷地区增派了四旅军队，其中包括两个步兵旅，一个装甲兵旅和一个炮兵旅。此外，还增派了一支火箭部队。以色列军队还在戈兰高地的基地上安置了地对地导弹。同时，以色列侵略军在西奈半岛举行了一系列的“军事演习”，以侵略军参谋长巴勒夫亲自参加了这些演习。
    以色列军队的这些军事活动引起了阿拉伯国家的警惕。约旦军方人士宣布，约旦军队和驻扎在约旦的伊拉克军队正处于警戒状态。阿联政府发言人也说，阿联非常严重地注视着以色列军队在约旦河西岸的集结。
    以色列国防部长达扬最近疯狂地叫嚣说，目前的局势“会长期继续下去，以色列应当继续在它所控制的领土上执行它的政策。”他还扬言，以色列“必须永远守住沙姆沙伊赫”。
    据特拉维夫消息，达扬还向以色列议会的劳工党党员吹嘘，以色列要把它去年六月战争以来侵占的阿拉伯领土，包括从海滨到约旦河谷的土地“统一”起来。
    据报道，以色列最近气焰嚣张，是因为它在政治上得到了美帝国主义的撑腰和在军事上得到它的美国主子的进一步援助。
    正是在美国近东事务助理国务卿戴维斯十六日跑到以色列进行所谓“了解情况”的“访问”前后，以色列对周围的阿拉伯国家猖狂地进行武装威胁。
    开罗《共和国报》十七日透露，以色列最近已经得到了美国提供的“鬼怪式”飞机，其中有一些已经使用于以色列占领区。
    以色列在加紧军队集结和调动的同时，正继续不断对约旦和阿联进行军事挑衅。
    据约旦军方发言人在安曼宣布，二十日和十七日晨，以色列侵略军用机关枪和迫击炮攻击约旦河谷北部的约旦村庄巴库拉和阿德西亚，约旦军队进行了还击。此外，以色列和约旦军队二十日在约旦河达米亚桥进行了炮战。
    十七日夜间，以色列侵略军用大炮轰击乌姆西德的约旦军队，约旦军队进行了还击。
    以色列侵略军最近再次向阿联进行军事挑衅。十八日，以色列侵略军向苏伊士运河北部坎塔拉附近的阿联军队开火，打死阿联军官和士兵五人。
