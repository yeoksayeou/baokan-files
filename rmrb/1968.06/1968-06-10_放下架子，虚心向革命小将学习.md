Last summer, I and a few comrades from the regiment went to a certain normal school for military training. Before we left, I thought: I must learn from the revolutionary youth, treat them as my teachers, and rely on them to carry out the military training well. After arriving at the school, the revolutionary youth knew that I was a delegate to the National People's Congress and a combat hero, and they all showed great respect for me. They would say "learn from the old hero" every time they opened their mouths. Every time there was a meeting, they would ask me to speak, and they would often come to me to assign tasks. Some students said: "For military training, you say how to do it and we will do it." Gradually, I talked more and did less, sitting upstairs all day planning, and not getting involved with the youth.

Once, to further promote the high tide of revolutionary criticism, I drafted a "plan." During the meeting to discuss it, many students were not satisfied with the "plan" I proposed, thinking it was something a few people imagined with their brains, lacking the wisdom of the masses. If we followed this "plan," we would not be able to push the revolutionary criticism to a new height and eradicate the poison of the revisionist educational line. The opinions of the youth shocked me greatly. Why was a plan that I had thought about for days suddenly overturned? I pondered this matter repeatedly. I realized that after entering the school, because I gave instructions everywhere but studied seriously little, sitting in the position of a teacher, I often subjectively set frameworks for things. Isn't this completely contrary to Chairman Mao's teaching of "to be a good teacher, one must first be a good student," and my own determination before entering the school?

At this time, I thought of a few soldiers in the military training team. They spent the whole day rolling around with the revolutionary youth, humbly learning from them, understanding many situations, and their awareness of the struggle between the two lines improved rapidly in a short time. When we came to the school, I and the comrades from the military training team together expressed our determination to learn from the youth, but in practice, I did not do as well as the soldiers. What was the reason? In terms of position, I was higher than the soldiers; in terms of age, I was older than the soldiers; in terms of tempering in revolutionary struggles, I had more than the soldiers. Thinking it over, I found that I had a "senior" burden on my back. For more than ten years, I have been going in and out with the titles of "old hero" and "old commander," my ears filled with this "senior" word, my mind gradually accepting this "senior" word, and my actions naturally showing this "senior" word. Therefore, wherever I went, I only wanted to talk and not to do; only wanted to teach and not to learn. This time, when I came to do military training, I said with my mouth that I would learn from the revolutionary youth, but in my mind, I had not put down this "senior" word, so the revolutionary youth took themselves as teachers and felt at ease; my intention to learn from the revolutionary youth fell through.

After the revolutionary youth overturned the plan I drafted, the entire school of teachers and students together came up with ideas and methods, and finally formulated a plan that everyone was relatively satisfied with. They took the criticism of the revisionist educational line as the focus and organized several campaigns. In the great criticism, they invited old poor peasants to the school to give class education on class struggle, organized investigation teams to go deep into factories and rural areas, listened to workers and poor and lower-middle peasants denounce the crimes of the revisionist educational line, and sought their opinions on the educational revolution. They made the great criticism wave upon wave, and the entire school presented a lively scene. In the great criticism, the revolutionary youth, with deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, worked tirelessly and bravely. They had a clear direction, strong momentum, many methods, and the great criticism was carried out vigorously, which also strongly promoted the military training work.

This incident deeply educated me. I further understood Chairman Mao's teaching: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous," and "in a certain sense, the most intelligent and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." This is an unshakable truth. The revolutionary youth nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought everywhere showed the most active, most vigorous, most eager to learn, and least conservative thorough revolutionary spirit. Under the thousand-pound pressure of the bourgeois reactionary line, they fearlessly held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, waged a tenacious struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, and created a great uproar against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. They established merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Their revolutionary spirit is worth my serious learning. For cadres like me, even if I have achieved some results under Chairman Mao's guidance in the past, I must not be arrogant. Revolution is constantly deepening and developing. Past achievements can only explain the past, not the present. Under the new situation of struggle, we must stand on a new starting line, strive to learn Chairman Mao's latest instructions, accept new things, study new problems, and continue the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, making new contributions to the Party and the people.

After this, I moved to the dormitory of the revolutionary youth, ate from the same pot, slept on the same kang, worked, studied, and fought against selfishness and revisionism together with them. I put down my arrogance, discarded the "senior" word, and truly blended in with the revolutionary youth. I deeply felt that: with the spirit of being a good student, one can discover the advantages of the revolutionary youth, love them, and learn from them; one can help each other in the common struggle and make joint progress.

### 放下架子，虚心向革命小将学习

    放下架子，虚心向革命小将学习
    战斗英雄、某部副团长　黄丑和
    去年夏天，我和团里几个同志到某师范学校搞军训。临去前，我想：一定要向革命小将学习，拜他们为师，依靠他们把军训搞好。到校后，革命小将知道我是全国人民代表大会代表，又是战斗英雄，都对我非常尊重，他们张口闭口“向老英雄学习”。每次开会都要我去发言，平日还经常找我要求给任务。有的同学说：“搞军训，你说咋干我们咋干。”渐渐地我就说得多，做得少，整天坐在上面筹划，没有深入到小将中去。
    有一次，为了进一步掀起革命大批判的高潮，我拟出一个“方案”。开会讨论时，许多同学不满意我提出的“方案”，认为是少数人凭脑子想象出来的东西，没有集中群众的智慧。照这个“方案”去做，达不到把革命大批判推向高潮、肃清修正主义教育路线流毒的目的。小将们的意见，使我受到很大震动。一个苦思冥想了几天的方案为什么一下子被推翻了呢？我反复琢磨这件事。我发觉，进校后，由于我到处指点多，认真学习少，屁股坐在当先生的位置上，遇事常常主观地定框框。这不是和毛主席教导的“要作好先生，首先要作好学生”，以及自己进校前下的决心完全相违背吗？
    这时，我想起军训队的几个战士，他们整天和革命小将滚在一块，虚心向革命小将学习，了解很多情况，进校时间不长，两条路线斗争觉悟提高很快。来校时，我和军训队的同志一起表示了向小将学习的决心，可是，实践证明，我做的远不如战士好。原因在什么地方呢？论职务，我比战士高，论年龄，我比战士大，论在革命斗争中受到的锻炼，我比战士多。想来想去，我发现自己背上一个“老”字的包袱。十几年来，在“老英雄”、“老首长”的称呼中来来去去，耳朵里装满了这个“老”字，思想上逐渐地承认了这个“老”字，行动上也很自然地表现出这个“老”字。因此，每到一处，只愿说，不愿做；只愿教，不愿学。这次来搞军训，嘴里说向革命小将学习，思想上仍然没有放下这个“老”字，因此，革命小将把自己当成老师心安理得；自己向革命小将学习的打算就落了空。
    革命小将推翻我拟出的方案后，全校师生一块出主意想办法，终于制定出大家比较满意的方案。把批判修正主义教育路线作为重点，组织了几个战役。在大批判中，请苦大仇深的老贫农到学校上阶级教育课，组织调查组深入到工厂、农村，听工人和贫下中农控诉修正主义教育路线的罪恶，征求他们对教育革命的意见，把革命大批判搞得一浪高过一浪，整个学校呈现一片生气勃勃的景象。在革命大批判中，革命小将满怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，废寝忘食，英勇奋战。他们方向明，干劲足，办法多，革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈，也有力地推动了军训工作。
    这件事深深地教育了我，我进一步体会到毛主席教导的：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”，“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”。这是颠扑不破的真理。用毛泽东思想哺育出来的革命小将，处处表现了最积极，最有生气，最肯学习，最少保守思想的彻底革命精神。在资产阶级反动路线的千斤压力下，他们无所畏惧，始终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向资产阶级反动路线进行了顽强的斗争，大造了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的反，在无产阶级文化大革命中建立了功勋。他们的革命精神是值得我好好学习的。象我这样的干部，即使过去在毛主席教导下做出一点成绩，也绝不能骄傲。革命是不断深入发展的，过去的成绩只能说明过去，不能说明现在。在新的斗争形势下，我们必须站在新的起跑线上，努力学习毛主席的最新指示，接受新事物，研究新问题，才能在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命，为党和人民做出新的贡献。
    从这以后，我搬到革命小将宿舍里，和他们吃一锅饭，睡一铺炕，一块劳动，一块学习，一块斗私批修。我放下了架子，丢掉了“老”字，就和革命小将真正打成了一片。我深深体会到：有了甘当小学生的精神，才能发现革命小将的优点，热爱他们，学习他们；才能在共同的斗争中，互相帮助，共同进步。
