The U.S. empire uses NATO to plot a new conspiracy with the Soviet Union. At the North Atlantic Council, they concocted a so-called "declaration" for the "mutual reduction" of troops stationed in Europe, making another counter-revolutionary deal with the Soviet revisionists to accelerate the eastward movement of troops to suppress the revolutionary peoples of Asia.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 26th, Reykjavik, Iceland: At a time when the U.S. empire and Soviet revisionists are tightening their global counter-revolutionary collusion, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization held its annual spring ministerial meeting in Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, on the 24th and 25th. After the meeting, a "declaration" was issued, demanding that the Warsaw Pact, controlled by the Soviet revisionists, work together with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to seek "mutual reduction" of troops in Europe. This is to allow the U.S. empire to transfer its troops stationed in Western Europe to Asia to massacre the revolutionary peoples of Asia.

The meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was held at a time when the imperialist camp led by the U.S. empire is facing the fierce onslaught of the world's revolutionary peoples, and the U.S. empire is tightening its collusion with the Soviet revisionists to extricate itself from the predicament. In the past half month, the U.S. empire has made four dirty deals with the Soviet revisionists on issues such as "preventing nuclear proliferation." Now, it plans to use this aggressive organization to make another evil deal with the Soviet revisionists.

At this meeting, the U.S. empire rallied its Western "allies" to concoct a so-called "declaration" for the "mutual reduction" of troops by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact. This "declaration" vigorously advocates that the U.S. and the Soviet Union first "mutually reduce forces" in Central Europe and claims that the member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have "decided to make all necessary preparations to discuss this issue with the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries and require these countries to participate in this work."

The "declaration" for the mutual reduction of troops in Europe by the U.S. empire and its Western European allies is an important step in the U.S. empire's counter-revolutionary global strategy of shifting military forces eastward. Due to the full-scale restoration of capitalism by the Soviet revisionists at home and their policy of surrender and betrayal abroad, the U.S. empire and its Western European allies openly acknowledged at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting at the end of last year that "the threat from the Soviet Union to Western Europe has become a thing of the past." On the other hand, due to the repeated defeats suffered by the U.S. empire on the battlefield in Vietnam and the surging armed struggles of the revolutionary peoples of Asia, the U.S. empire, which is facing a shortage of troops, is eager to reach an agreement with the Soviet revisionists to transfer its hundreds of thousands of combat troops stationed in Western Europe to Asia to join the Vietnam War, suppress the revolutionary peoples of Asia, and threaten China.

U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk praised the Soviet revisionists' evil deeds of colluding with the U.S. to oppose China at the meeting. He claimed that the so-called "treaty to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons" jointly concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union is "very useful." The communiqué issued after the meeting pointed out that in recent years, "relations between the East and the West have improved," and "the prospect of further improvement may be good." It also boasted that the countries attending the meeting "plan to continue their efforts to promote détente."

The communiqué openly stated that the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's policy of so-called "promoting détente" is to "resolve some fundamental political issues in Europe" and achieve "a stable order in Europe." In other words, it is to intensify infiltration into the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries and strengthen the collusion between the imperialists and the revisionists to maintain their counter-revolutionary old order in Europe. The communiqué also openly expressed support for the militaristic ambitions of West German elements to annex the German Democratic Republic, declaring that "the member governments of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization do not recognize the German Democratic Republic."

In recent years, as the U.S. empire's hegemony in Western Europe has accelerated its decline, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has become increasingly fragmented. To prevent this organization from collapsing and to adapt to the needs of the U.S. empire's global strategy, the U.S. empire is hastening to use this aggressive organization as a tool for counter-revolutionary collusion with the Soviet revisionist clique. However, Western European countries also have their own plans in this regard and are unwilling to accept U.S. control. This time, the foreign ministers of France, Italy, and Luxembourg did not attend the meeting. The French representative, Sedou, who replaced the foreign minister to attend the meeting, publicly stated that France "insists on an independent policy towards Eastern Europe." According to Sedou's request, the communiqué had to state that France disagrees with many clauses in the communiqué and the declaration and is not bound by these clauses. This once again shows that although the U.S. empire is currently desperately propping up the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, this fragmented mess, to serve U.S. aggressive policies and war policies, this aggressive organization is already on its last legs. No matter how hard the U.S. tries, it will be very difficult to revive it.

    美帝利用北大西洋集团策划美苏勾结新阴谋
    在北大西洋集团理事会上炮制所谓美苏“相互均衡地”减少驻欧部队“宣言”，同苏修再做反革命交易，以便加速兵力东移，镇压亚洲人民革命
    据新华社二十六日讯　雷克雅未克消息：正当美帝、苏修加紧全球性的反革命大勾结的时候，北大西洋侵略集团二十四日和二十五日在冰岛首都雷克雅未克举行了一年一度的春季部长理事会会议。会后发表了一项“宣言”，要求苏修控制的华沙条约组织同北大西洋侵略集团一起，谋求“相互均衡地”减少在欧洲的驻军，以便美帝把它驻在西欧的军队调往亚洲，屠杀亚洲的革命人民。
    北大西洋侵略集团的这次会议，是在以美帝为首的帝国主义阵营受到世界人民革命风暴的猛烈冲击，美帝加紧同苏修勾结以摆脱困境的形势下举行的。在最近半个月里，美帝就所谓“防止核扩散”等问题同苏修接连做成了四笔肮脏交易，现在又打算利用这个侵略集团同苏修再做一笔罪恶买卖。
    美帝国主义在这次会议上纠合它的西方“盟国”，炮制了一个所谓北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织
  “相互均衡地减少部队”的“宣言”。这个“宣言”极力鼓吹美、苏双方首先在欧洲中部“均衡地相互减少武力”，并且声称北大西洋集团成员国已经“决定为了同苏联和其它东欧国家讨论这个问题而进行一切必要的准备，并要求这些国家一起来进行”这一工作。
    美帝伙同它的西欧盟国炮制的这个美、苏相互减少驻欧洲的军队的“宣言”，是美帝推行军事力量东移的反革命全球战略的重要步骤。由于苏修在国内全面实行资本主义复辟，对外执行投降和叛卖的政策，美帝和它的西欧盟国早在去年年底的北大西洋集团会议上就公开确认，“苏联对西欧的威胁已成为过去”。另一方面，由于美帝在侵越战场上迭遭惨败，亚洲革命人民的武装斗争风起云涌，因此，兵源枯竭的美帝国主义急于同苏修拍板成交，以便把它驻在西欧的几十万作战部队调往亚洲，投入侵越战争，镇压亚洲革命人民，并威胁中国。
    美国国务卿腊斯克在会上对苏修不遗余力地联美反华的罪恶行径大为夸奖。他声称，美、苏合伙炮制的所谓“防止核扩散条约”是“十分有用的”。会后发表的公报指出，近年来“东西方关系已得到了改善”，
  “进一步改善的前景可能是良好的”，并扬言与会的国家“打算继续努力促进和缓”。
    公报毫不讳言，北大西洋集团推行这种所谓“促进和缓”的政策的目的，是要“使欧洲的一些基本政治问题能够得到解决”，实现欧洲的“稳定的秩序”。换句话说，就是要加紧对苏联和其它一些东欧国家的渗透，加强帝修之间的勾结，以维持它们统治欧洲的反革命旧秩序。公报还公然表示支持西德军国主义分子并吞德意志民主共和国的野心，叫嚷说，北大西洋集团“各成员国政府不承认德意志民主共和国”。
    近年来，随着美帝国主义在西欧霸权的加速衰落，北大西洋集团日益分崩离析。为了使这个集团不致树倒猢狲散，并且适应美帝全球战略的需要，美帝正加紧利用这个侵略集团作为同苏修叛徒集团进行反革命勾结的工具。可是，西欧国家在这方面也是各有打算，不愿接受美国的控制。这次会议，法国、意大利和卢森堡的外交部长没有参加。代替外交部长出席这次会议的法国代表塞杜还公开声明，法国“坚持对东欧奉行独立的政策”。根据塞杜的要求，会议公报上不得不写明法国不同意公报和宣言中的许多条款，不受这些条款的约束。这再一次表明，尽管美帝国主义目前仍在拚命支撑北大西洋侵略集团这个支离破碎的烂摊子，以便为美国的侵略政策和战争政策服务，但是，由于这个侵略集团已经气息奄奄，无论美国怎样卖力，也很难再使它起死回生了。
