The Soviet revisionist clique's backward policies and restoration of capitalism have severely damaged the productive forces of society, leading to extensive soil erosion in the Soviet Union and enormous losses.

According to the Soviet revisionist magazine *Moscow*, in recent years, vast areas of arable land in the Soviet Union have suffered severe water and wind erosion. In the European part of the Soviet Union alone, nearly 50 million hectares of arable land have been affected by water erosion. In the Russian regions of Voronezh, Rostov, Saratov, Kursk, and others, thousands of hectares of arable land are "washed away" each year. One-third of Ukraine's agricultural land is deteriorating. In Armenia, 100,000 hectares of arable land have been completely washed away. In Azerbaijan, 40% of the land has been affected by water erosion. In Georgia, some collective farms have had to relocate because all their arable land has been eroded. In many agricultural regions, the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium lost due to soil erosion exceed the amount of fertilizer applied to the soil. Meanwhile, gullies continue to appear. In Ukraine, there are about 1 million hectares of land with numerous gullies. In the central black soil region of Russia, the average length of gullies per square kilometer is 580 meters, and in Kursk and Oryol regions, it is 700 meters.

In the Soviet revisionists' boasted main reclamation area of Kazakhstan, sandstorms occur every year, affecting 20 million hectares of arable land. In the Pavlodar region of Kazakhstan, in 1963 alone, more than 1 million hectares of crops were destroyed by sandstorms. In 1965, wind erosion affected 5 million hectares of newly reclaimed land in the border regions of Kazakhstan. In the past 15 years, about 3 million hectares of shifting sands have appeared in Kazakhstan.

Soil erosion is widespread throughout the Soviet Union, causing annual losses of 4 billion rubles.

Since seizing power, the Soviet revisionist clique has ruthlessly destroyed the soil and crop protection measures implemented during Stalin's leadership, such as afforestation and grass-crop rotation, leading to these severe consequences. The magazine *Moscow* reveals the Soviet people's nostalgia when discussing land erosion. It admits that the 1948 plan to transform nature, associated with Stalin's name, was "enthusiastically welcomed by the Soviet people." Within a few years, "tens of thousands of agronomists, soil scientists, foresters, and forestry workers were trained, 570 forest protection stations and 230 large nurseries were established." However, this plan was later shelved.

The Soviet revisionist clique has ruined the richly endowed Soviet Union in this way, depleting the grain reserves of the Stalin era and severely damaging agricultural productivity. The Soviet people will one day settle accounts with the Soviet revisionist clique.

    苏修集团倒行逆施使沃土变成荒地
    仅苏联欧洲部分就有数千万公顷耕地遭受水蚀　全国土地侵蚀损失每年达四十亿卢布
    本报讯　苏修叛徒集团复辟资本主义的倒行逆施，严重地破坏了社会生产力，造成苏联土地侵蚀，损失巨大。
    据苏修《莫斯科》杂志透露，近年来苏联大面积耕地遭到严重的水蚀和风蚀。仅仅在苏联的欧洲部分，遭受水蚀的耕地就有近五千万公顷。在俄罗斯的沃罗涅日州、罗斯托夫州、萨拉托夫州、库尔斯克州和其他州，每年有数千公顷耕地“被冲销”。乌克兰的农业用地有三分之一在变劣。在亚美尼亚，有十万公顷面积的可耕层全部被冲刷掉了。在阿塞拜疆，全部土地的百分之四十遭受了水蚀。在格鲁吉亚，一些集体农庄由于全部可耕土地受到侵蚀，不得不把农庄“搬家”。在许多农业地区，因耕地受到侵蚀而消失的氮、磷和钾，比给土壤所施的肥料还要多。同时，冲沟也在不断地出现。在乌克兰，就有约一百万公顷的多冲沟土地。在俄罗斯中央黑土地带，冲沟的长度按每一平方公里计算，平均为五百八十米，而在库尔斯克州和奥勒尔州则为七百米。
    在苏修大吹特吹的主要开荒地区哈萨克斯坦，每年都有沙暴，受沙暴之害的耕地已达两千万公顷。在哈萨克斯坦的巴夫洛达州，一九六三年一年即有一百多万公顷的庄稼被沙暴毁坏，一九六五年，风蚀侵袭了哈萨克斯坦新垦地边疆区的五百万公顷土地。近十五年来，在哈萨克斯坦出现了大约有三百万公顷的流沙。
    土地的侵蚀几乎遍及苏联全国各地，它每年所造成的损失高达四十亿卢布的庞大数字。
    苏修集团自篡夺政权以来，把斯大林领导时期为保护土壤和庄稼所实行的护田造林措施以及当时农业上采用的草田轮作制等，都粗暴地破坏了，因而造成这样严重的后果。《莫斯科》杂志在谈到耕地遭受侵蚀时，透露出苏联人民抚今追昔的心情。它承认：一九四八年通过的“同斯大林的名字联系在一起”的苏联改造自然的计划，受到“苏联人民热情欢迎”。几年之内，“学校培养了数以万计的农林土壤改良学家、林学家、造林工作的机务人员，建立了五百七十个护林站和二百三十个大型树苗场”。但是，这个计划后来被搁置了。
    苏修叛徒集团把地大物博的苏联糟踏成这个样子，不仅花光了斯大林时期的粮食储备，而且严重地破坏了农业生产力。苏联人民是终有一天要向苏修叛徒集团算账的。
