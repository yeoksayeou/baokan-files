In accordance with the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary great alliance of Tianjin Second Cotton Mill has been continuously consolidated and developed in terms of systems, departments, and shifts, forming a unified fighting unit. In the fierce attack against a handful of class enemies, the workers have united as one, fought together, and fully demonstrated their combat effectiveness. They have exposed one by one the hidden class enemies and achieved new victories in the revolution and production.

The mill has seven sub-factories, eighteen workshops, and more than eight thousand workers. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the former Tianjin Municipal Committee's anti-revolutionary revisionist clique of Wan Xiaotang and Zhang Huai san took this mill as a key point to obstinately promote the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, creating divisions among the masses and labeling the revolutionary masses who dared to rebel against the capitalist roaders as "counter-revolutionaries." The revolutionary masses of the mill fought their way out from under the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. The workers of the mill established twenty-seven mass organizations that crossed sub-factories, workshops, and shifts, each fighting on their own. Some production shifts had workers belonging to more than ten different organizations. These organizations split into two opposing factions.

After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive was issued, emphasizing that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," the stationed People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team immediately organized the broad revolutionary masses to study and implement it thoroughly. The entire mill quickly achieved revolutionary great alliance in terms of systems, departments, and shifts, and established a unified mass organization.

After the revolutionary great alliance was achieved among the proletarian revolutionary masses of the entire mill, they further carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. They organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Using Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon, they fiercely criticized and exposed the series of counter-revolutionary revisionist goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the theory of "class struggle extinction," "material incentives," "bonus system," and "expert management." In the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses combined the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness, eliminating the poison of revisionism. In this way, under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad revolutionary masses further consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance in terms of systems, departments, and shifts, achieving the revolutionary three-in-one combination and establishing the revolutionary committee of the mill.

Because the broad revolutionary masses of this mill have continuously enhanced their proletarian party spirit, overcome bourgeois factionalism, and consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance in the struggle, they have become an iron fist under the leadership of the revolutionary committee of the mill, dealing heavy blows to the class enemies. In the past, a revolutionary mass organization in this mill was deceived by a die-hard capitalist roader, who was protected as a "revolutionary cadre." Now, the responsible persons and revolutionary masses originally belonging to this organization fearlessly exposed the various despicable means used by this capitalist roader to carry out counter-revolutionary activities in secret after the revolutionary masses achieved the revolutionary great alliance. They exposed the various crimes committed by this bad element in plotting to sabotage the newly born revolutionary committee and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad revolutionary masses of the entire mill have united their hearts and efforts, exposing one by one the handful of class enemies who had infiltrated the mass organizations and firmly striking at this handful of class enemies.

In the struggle against the enemy, the broad revolutionary masses have further strengthened revolutionary unity. They actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "tighten the production of cloth" and applied the revolutionary enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the production struggle, making the production situation completely new. Since late February, the production of the entire mill has risen sharply month by month. In April, the production plan was overfulfilled. The total production value in May was 4.5% higher than in April; the average daily output compared to April was 13.7% higher for cotton cloth and 5% higher for cotton yarn.

    天津第二棉纺厂形成战斗整体  抓革命促生产不断取得新胜利
    全厂革命职工精神振奋，斗志昂扬，揪出了一小撮隐藏的阶级敌人，生产逐旬逐月大幅度上升
    据新华社天津十二日电　天津第二棉纺厂广大革命职工，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在毛泽东思想原则基础上不断巩固和发展按系统、按部门、按班组的革命大联合，形成一个统一的战斗整体，在向一小撮阶级敌人发起的猛烈进攻中，团结一致，共同对敌，发挥了最大的战斗力，把隐藏的一小撮阶级敌人一个个地揭露出来，不断取得抓革命促生产的新胜利。
    棉纺二厂有七个分厂，十八个车间，八千多名职工。无产阶级文化大革命一开始，旧天津市委的万晓塘、张淮三反革命修正主义集团把这个厂作为重点，顽固推行中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，在群众中制造分裂，把起来向走资派造反的革命群众打成了“反革命”。厂里的无产阶级革命派从资产阶级反动路线下冲杀出来，全厂职工们先后成立起来二十七个跨分厂、跨车间、跨班组的群众组织，各自为战。有的一个生产班组的职工，分别属于十几个组织。这些组织分裂成了对立的两大派。
    毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示下达以后，驻厂的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队立即组织广大革命职工认真学习，坚决落实，全厂很快实现了按系统、按部门、按班组的革命大联合，成立了统一的群众组织。
    全厂无产阶级革命派实现革命大联合以后，进一步深入持久地开展革命大批判。他们大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，学习班紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，用毛泽东思想这一最锐利的武器，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”、“专家治厂”等一系列反革命修正主义黑货，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线。在革命大批判中，广大革命群众把批修和斗私紧密结合起来，肃清修正主义的流毒。这样，广大革命职工就在毛泽东思想的统帅下，从组织上到思想上进一步巩固和发展了按系统、按部门、按班组的革命大联合，实现了革命三结合，建立了厂革命委员会。
    由于这个厂的广大革命职工在斗争中不断增强无产阶级党性，克服资产阶级派性，巩固和发展了革命的大联合，他们在厂革委会领导下捏成一个铁拳头，给了阶级敌人以沉重的打击。过去，这个厂有一个革命群众组织被一个顽固不化的走资派所蒙蔽，曾把这个坏家伙当作“革命干部”而保护起来。现在，原属这个组织的负责人和革命群众，毫无顾忌地揭发了这个走资派在革命职工实现了革命大联合以后，仍然在暗地里进行反革命活动的各种卑鄙手段，揭发了这个坏家伙阴谋破坏新生的革命委员会，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的种种罪行。全厂广大革命职工心往一处想，劲往一处使，把过去混入群众组织内部的一小撮煽阴风、点鬼火的阶级敌人一个个地挖了出来，稳、准、狠地打击了这一小撮阶级敌人。
    广大革命职工在对敌斗争中进一步加强了革命的团结。他们积极响应毛主席“必须把布匹抓紧”的伟大号召，把在无产阶级文化大革命运动中焕发出来的革命干劲运用到生产斗争中去，使生产面貌焕然一新。二月下旬以来，全厂生产逐旬逐月大幅度上升，四月份超额完成了生产计划。五月份的生产总值又比四月份提高了百分之四点五；平均日产量与四月份比较，棉布增长了百分之十三点七，棉纱增长了百分之五。
