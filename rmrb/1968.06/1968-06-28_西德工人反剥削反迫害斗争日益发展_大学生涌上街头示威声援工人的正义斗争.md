West Germany's class contradictions are intensifying, and the broad masses of workers are increasingly fighting against the exploitation and political oppression of monopoly capital.

More than 350 chemical workers at a nitrogen plant in Ober-Ekkenhagen, operated by the Salzgitter Chemical Combine in West Germany, went on an indefinite strike starting June 24 to protest the capitalists' scheme to close the factory and lay off workers. On June 25, workers carrying banners demonstrated at the factory management committee, demanding that the management revoke this unreasonable decision. On the same day, more than 1,000 workers from two other plants belonging to the same combine in Goslar and Lüneburg also went on a solidarity strike and held a massive demonstration, marching towards the combine's central management committee to strongly protest the management's "most brutal infringement" of workers' rights.

Previously, over 2,000 workers at three pipe factories owned by the Thyssen Combine went on strike on June 12 to strongly protest the management's arbitrary layoffs and wage cuts. Among them, several hundred workers from the pipe factory in Lesholz even took to the streets in anger, protesting that the monopoly capitalists had laid off 330 workers in just half a year.

In Freiburg, a machine factory owned by the American-controlled Lüdenscheid Combine arbitrarily laid off a worker who had actively participated in the struggle against the "emergency laws," sparking strong indignation among all the workers in the factory. To support the workers of this factory, more than 150 university students in Freiburg took to the streets to hold a demonstration and march.

    大学生涌上街头示威声援工人的正义斗争
    新华社波恩二十六日电　西德国内阶级矛盾不断激化，广大工人群众反对垄断资本剥削和政治迫害的斗争日益发展。
    西德国营萨尔茨吉特尔化学康采恩设在上埃肯什维克的一家氮气工厂的三百五十多名化学工人，为了抗议资本家阴谋关闭工厂和解雇工人，自本月二十四日起举行无限期罢工。二十五日，工人们打着旗帜到工厂管理委员会示威，要求厂方取消这个无理决定。同一天，属于同一家康采恩的设在戈斯拉和吕纳堡的两家分厂的一千多名工人举行了声援性罢工和声势浩大的示威，分头走向这家康采恩的总管理委员会，强烈抗议资方对工人权利的“最粗暴的侵犯”。
    在这以前，蒂森康采恩所属的三家钢管厂的两千多名工人十二日举行罢工，强烈抗议资方无理解雇工人和削减工资。其中，设在莱斯霍尔茨的钢管厂的数百名工人还曾愤怒地走上街头，抗议垄断资本家在半年内已无理解雇了三百三十名工人。
    在弗赖堡，美国资本控制的里敦康采恩所属的一家机械工厂，无理解雇了一名积极参加反对“紧急状态法”斗争的工人，激起了全厂工人的强烈愤怒。为了声援这家工厂的工人，弗赖堡的一百五十多名大学生曾涌上街头举行了示威游行。
