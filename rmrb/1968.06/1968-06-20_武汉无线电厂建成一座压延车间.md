The revolutionary workers of Wuhan Radio Factory have resolutely implemented the great leader Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, designed and constructed the workshop themselves, and recently completed a rolling mill workshop, which has now been put into production.

The large-scale sets of equipment installed in this rolling mill workshop can roll thick aluminum or copper ingots into rods of colored metal as thin as a finger in just over twenty seconds, to be used in the production of electrical wires and cables.

During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and workers have united as one, worked hard, and overcome one difficulty after another. In less than a year, they have successfully completed the entire construction task.

    武汉无线电厂建成一座压延车间
    武汉无线电厂的革命职工，坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，发扬自力更生的革命精神，自己设计，自己施工，最近建成了一座压延车间，并已投入生产。
    这座压延车间安装的大型成套设备，可以在二十多秒钟内把粗大的铝锭或铜锭轧制成手指般粗细的有色金属杆材，供生产电线电缆产品使用。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工齐心协力，艰苦奋战，克服了一个又一个的困难，只用不到一年的时间就胜利完成了全部建设任务。
