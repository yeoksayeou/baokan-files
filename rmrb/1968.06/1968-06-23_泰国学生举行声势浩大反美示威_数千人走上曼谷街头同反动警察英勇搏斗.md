Thai students from Thammasat University and other schools held a massive protest in Bangkok on June 21, marching through the streets to denounce American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and the Thanom-Kittikachorn puppet regime's role as an accomplice to American imperialism.

The protesting students marched towards the fake parliament building, demanding that the Thanom-Kittikachorn regime recall Thai troops sent to South Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder in the American war of aggression. They also demanded a ban on American soldiers entering Thailand under the guise of "vacationing" to commit crimes.

The students also expressed strong dissatisfaction and indignation towards various reactionary measures taken by the Thanom-Kittikachorn regime.

The students' just struggle won the support of the citizens. Thousands of Bangkok residents gathered on the streets, cheering enthusiastically for the protesting students.

In the struggle, the students fearlessly confronted the large number of police sent by the Thanom-Kittikachorn regime to suppress them. They bravely retaliated with stones, fiercely charged through the police barricades, and broke through the police lines, ultimately forcing the police chief to accept their petition.

This large-scale protest took place the day after the American-Thanom clique issued their fake constitution. It exposed the Thanom-Kittikachorn regime's so-called "freedom" and "democracy" as a sham. The Thanom-Kittikachorn puppet regime was terrified of the students' struggle, hastily mobilizing a large number of police to suppress them, brutally beating the students in an attempt to extinguish the flames of struggle. This exposed their issuance of the fake constitution as a complete political fraud.

    泰国学生举行声势浩大反美示威
    数千人走上曼谷街头同反动警察英勇搏斗
    新华社二十二日讯 曼谷消息：泰国政法大学等学校的学生数千人二十一日走上曼谷街头，举行声势浩大的反对美帝国主义侵略越南和反对他侬—巴博卖国集团充当美帝帮凶的示威游行。
    示威学生走向伪议会大厦，强烈要求他侬—巴博卖国集团把派去南越充当美帝侵越战争炮灰的泰国军队撤回泰国，并且要求禁止侵越美军官兵以“度假”为名到泰国为非作歹。
    示威学生还对他侬—巴博卖国集团的一些反动措施表示强烈的不满和愤慨。
    学生们的正义斗争，得到了市民的支持。聚集在街头的数以千百计的曼谷市民，向示威学生热烈欢呼。
    学生们在斗争中不畏强暴，同他侬—巴博卖国集团派去镇压的大批警察进行了英勇的搏斗。他们用石块英勇还击反动警察，猛烈冲击反动警察设置的街垒，并突破了警察的封锁线，最后迫使反动警察头子不得不出面收下他们的请愿书。
    这次大规模示威斗争是在美帝—他侬集团颁布伪宪法的第二天举行的。它拆穿了他侬—巴博集团所谓“自由”、“民主”的假面具。他侬—巴博傀儡集团对学生的斗争怕得要命，慌忙调动大批警察进行镇压，野蛮殴打学生，妄图扑灭斗争的火焰，从而暴露了它颁布伪宪法的把戏，是一场彻头彻尾的政治骗局。
