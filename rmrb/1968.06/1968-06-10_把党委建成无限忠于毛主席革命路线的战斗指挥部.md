The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy." In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have used Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat as our weapon. We have constantly raised our class struggle consciousness and our awareness of the struggle between the two lines. In the stormy waves of class struggle, we have striven to build the Party committee into a resolute command post that is unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, faithfully implements and bravely defends Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and leads the troops forward along the course charted by Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is a powerful ideological weapon for raising our awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution first began, we did not fully understand the great significance of this revolution and sometimes lagged behind the times. We studied Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat with this problem in mind. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Representatives of the bourgeoisie have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles. These bourgeois representatives are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of these people have already been exposed by us, some have not yet been exposed, and some are being trusted by us and are being cultivated as our successors, such as the character of Khrushchov. They are now sleeping beside us. All levels of the Party committee must pay full attention to this point." By comparing Chairman Mao's teachings with the actual class struggle, we deeply realized that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle is prominently manifested as the struggle between the two lines within the Party. The main target of the revolution under socialist conditions is a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. If we do not have a high level of awareness of the struggle between the two lines, we will lose our way in the sharp and complex class struggle and fall behind. We have decided to make raising our awareness of the struggle between the two lines the central task of the Party committee in studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought and promoting ideological revolutionization.

Using Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, method, and principle of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to arm our minds is the fundamental way to raise our awareness of the struggle between the two lines. In our work of supporting the left, we have insisted on placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's latest directives in the first position, understanding them word by word, and repeatedly checking our thoughts against them. We have especially paid attention to using Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat as our weapon, frequently analyzing the new situation, new trends, and new characteristics of class struggle, and recognizing and solving new problems that arise in the struggle. Each time we recognize and solve a problem, our awareness of the struggle between the two lines is raised one step higher.

When we first took on the task of supporting the left, after an investigation, we firmly supported the revolutionary rebels who were temporarily in the minority. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party brutally suppressed the revolutionary rebels and deceived some of the masses, attacking and insulting us. In this situation, we felt that something was wrong with this phenomenon, but we did not understand its essence. So, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao. Through our study, we realized that the attitude towards the mass movement is the dividing line between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is to believe in and rely on the masses, allowing the masses to educate themselves and liberate themselves; while the bourgeois reactionary line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents directs its spearhead at the masses, encircles the revolutionary faction, suppresses different opinions, and implements white terror. After understanding the essence of the two lines, we became clear-headed, and our love for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deepened, while our hatred for the bourgeois reactionary line intensified. We followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "it is not a matter of East Wind prevailing over West Wind or West Wind prevailing over East Wind, but a matter of no compromise on the issue of line," and engaged in a head-on struggle with a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line. When the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party suppressed the revolutionary masses, we stood up and firmly supported the revolutionary masses. We realized that protecting the revolutionary masses is to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Comrades unanimously expressed: For the sake of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, no matter how strong the adverse wind is or how big the waves are, we will firmly follow the great leader Chairman Mao and unshakably support the proletarian revolutionaries.

In our work of supporting the left, we encounter many problems every day, some of which are contradictions among the people, and some are contradictions between the enemy and us. For example, after the revolutionary committee was established, someone spread rumors, shouting to "smash the factional revolutionary committee." In the face of such a complex situation, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest directives and, following Chairman Mao's teachings, analyzed the situation at that time from the perspective of class struggle. We realized that a handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders and traitors within the Party, in collusion with untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society, stirred up a rightist wind of reversing cases, attempting to overthrow the newly born revolutionary government and restore capitalism. Our struggle with this handful of class enemies is a life-and-death struggle. Some masses, due to being deceived by class enemies, said some wrong things and did some wrong things, which are issues of understanding and are fundamentally different from the sabotage by class enemies. They should not be dealt with in the same way as enemies but should be educated with Mao Zedong Thought to quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and become a force in the struggle against the enemy. Because we distinguished between the enemy and us, we united the broad masses, exposed one bad person after another, repulsed the class enemies' arrogant attacks, and thoroughly smashed the rightist wind of reversing cases. In the fierce struggle against class enemies, our class struggle consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines reached a new level.

Struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism is the fundamental way to raise our awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party of the Fourth Red Army has various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the implementation of the Party's correct line." In our practical struggle of supporting the left, we deeply felt that "selfishness" is a big enemy that hinders us from implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad laboring people, and is a line for the public good. If we put "selfishness" first, we cannot correctly understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, cannot firmly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in any situation, and cannot bravely fight for the defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only by constantly struggling against selfishness and establishing public-mindedness can we constantly raise our awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Therefore, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "not breaking means not establishing," constantly eliminated the selfish thoughts that hindered us from correctly implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly transformed our worldview, and strove to build the Party committee into a combat collective that is unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, unconditionally loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Struggling against selfishness and establishing public-mindedness requires self-awareness. High self-awareness is the internal factor for resolving ideological contradictions and raising awareness of the struggle between the two lines. How can we achieve self-awareness in struggling against selfishness and establishing public-mindedness? Our experience is that we must raise the struggle against selfishness and establishing public-mindedness to the height of the struggle between the two lines, so that everyone truly understands that whether we can self-awarenessly struggle against selfishness and establish public-mindedness is a big issue of whether we can be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In this way, everyone can actively grasp the active thoughts on the "key" and "line," with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," and the tenacious will of "digging mountains without stopping," and launch an offensive against "selfishness." When we first carried out the task of supporting the left, some comrades were not bold enough, which was reflected in their hesitation in handling certain issues and their inability to firmly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Comrade Lin Biao said that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is a line with "daring" at the forefront. We repeatedly studied this directive of Comrade Lin Biao in connection with the actual struggle of supporting the left and realized that "daring" and "fear" are manifestations of the high and low levels of awareness of the struggle between the two lines. To eliminate "fear" and establish "daring," we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching of "a thorough materialist is fearless," dug deep into the root of "fear," and fiercely struggled against the "selfishness" in our minds. We also recalled our experience of fighting revolution under Chairman Mao, and everyone said that in the past, to defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we were fearless in the rain of bullets and shrapnel; today, in the continued struggle against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, we should be even more fearless and brave in battle. Because we eliminated "fear" and established "daring," our resolve to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death became stronger, and comrades firmly expressed: Live to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in battle, die to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with our lives. Once, a comrade from our Party committee was going to meet revolutionary rebels from another place. Beforehand, he learned that local capitalist-roaders were going to mobilize conservative forces to attack him. The young revolutionaries advised him not to go, but he said: "Revolution does not fear death, fearing death is not revolutionary! Retreating in the face of danger, how can one be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" He powerfully supported the revolutionary rebels with his revolutionary actions.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is incompatible with the bourgeois reactionary line. Only by thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line and eliminating its influence can we correctly, completely, and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's line." We followed Comrade Lin Biao's directive and combined the struggle against selfishness and establishing public-mindedness with the revolutionary criticism. Last year, for a period of time, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the local Party deceived the masses and fiercely attacked us for supporting the revolutionary leftists, saying that we supported the "rightist forces." In the face of this situation, we studied Chairman Mao's latest directives on the one hand to raise our awareness, and on the other hand, fiercely criticized the bourgeois reactionary line and struggled against the "selfishness" in our minds, becoming even more determined to implement and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After the revolutionary committee was established in the locality, some comrades in our Party committee had the thought of "taking a breather." We used Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle" as a weapon to criticize Khrushchov's advocacy of the theory of "extinguishing class struggle." In the criticism, comrades exposed the new situation, new trends, and new characteristics of class struggle and unanimously realized that after the revolutionary committee was established, class struggle had not ended. We not only should not relax but also should help the revolutionary committee to firmly grasp class struggle, carry out revolutionary criticism more deeply, launch a sustained and fierce attack on class enemies, and defend the newly born revolutionary committee. In the struggle against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, our awareness of the struggle between the two lines was further raised.

The stormy waves of mass struggle are a good classroom for raising our awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable, not understanding this point, we cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." We deeply felt that the stormy waves of mass struggle are a good classroom for raising our awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and the broad revolutionary masses are good teachers for raising our awareness of the struggle between the two lines. One incident deeply educated us: A comrade from our Party committee, due to not deeply understanding Chairman Mao's latest directive on achieving great unity, said some words that were not conducive to great unity. The revolutionary rebels immediately pointed out that his words were contrary to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We immediately invited the comrades from the revolutionary rebels, studied Chairman Mao's latest directives with them, and humbly listened to their opinions, greatly deepening our understanding of Chairman Mao's latest directive on achieving great unity. We deeply felt that our strings of struggle between the two lines were not as tight as those of the revolutionary rebels, and our awareness of the struggle between the two lines was not as high as theirs. Through this incident, we more clearly realized that the broad revolutionary masses are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, have the deepest understanding of Mao Zedong Thought, are the closest to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and have the firm resolve to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. This is a manifestation of high awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Honestly learning from the revolutionary masses can raise our awareness of the struggle between the two lines. From then on, we more consciously threw ourselves into the great mass struggle, humbly learning from the masses.

Learning from the masses, we must first put ourselves in the position of a student in our minds. Sometimes, some Party committee members regard themselves as leaders and cannot humbly learn from the masses. We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching of "we should go among the masses and learn from them," and more clearly realized that our relationship with the masses is one of unity and struggle in jointly studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and jointly implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the face of the broad revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we are forever students who will never graduate. Once we put ourselves in the right position, our self-awareness of learning from the masses increased. We often studied Chairman Mao's works with the revolutionary masses, humbly learned from them in our common struggle, their daring to defy adverse winds and waves, and their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, actively listened to their criticisms and opinions, consciously examined our thoughts and actions in the mass struggle, and constantly raised our awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

When we made some achievements in implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and were praised by the masses, our Party committee repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings of "humility makes one progress, pride makes one fall behind" and "do not rely on past merits, strive for new achievements," realizing that achievements should be attributed to the great leader Chairman Mao and the broad revolutionary masses, and we absolutely should not be proud and complacent, thinking that our awareness of the struggle between the two lines is already high. Instead, we should more humbly learn from the masses and more diligently raise our awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Only in this way can we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Therefore, we went more widely among the masses, humbly listened to the masses' criticisms, sought the masses' opinions about us, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes and carried out revolutionary criticism, further raising our awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Comrades deeply felt: The closer we are to the revolutionary masses, the closer we are to Chairman Mao; the more we love the revolutionary masses, the faster we raise our awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

Recently, we studied the brilliant deeds of Comrade Menhe with reverence, deeply moved by Comrade Menhe's lofty quality of being unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Compared with Comrade Menhe, our awareness of the struggle between the two lines is far behind. We firmly responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, learned from Comrade Menhe, diligently studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, further raised our awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and vowed to guard, stand watch, and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life!

    把党委建成无限忠于毛主席革命路线的战斗指挥部
    武汉部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会先进集体　某师党委
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们以毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的伟大理论为武器，不断提高阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，在阶级斗争的风浪里，努力把党委建设成无限忠于毛主席，忠实执行、英勇捍卫毛主席革命路线的坚强战斗指挥部，带领部队沿着毛主席指引的航向奋勇前进。
    毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的伟大理论，是我们提高两条路线斗争觉悟的强大思想武器
    无产阶级文化大革命刚开始的时候，我们对这场革命的伟大意义不够理解，有些跟不上形势。我们带着这个问题，认真地学习了毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的伟大理论。毛主席教导我们：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。”对照毛主席的教导，联系阶级斗争的实际，我们深深认识到，无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争突出地表现为党内两条路线的斗争，社会主义条件下，革命的主要对象是党内一小撮走资派。如果没有高度的两条路线斗争觉悟，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中就会迷航，会掉队。我们决心把提高两条路线斗争觉悟，作为党委活学活用毛泽东思想，促进思想革命化的中心课题。
    用毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策武装头脑，是提高两条路线斗争觉悟的根本。我们在支左工作中，坚持把活学活用毛主席的最新指示摆在第一位，一字一句地领会，反反复复地对照检查自己的思想。我们特别注意以毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的伟大理论为武器，经常分析阶级斗争的新形势、新动向、新特点，认识和解决斗争中出现的新问题。每认识和解决一个问题，我们的两条路线斗争觉悟就提高一步。
    我们刚担负支左任务的时候，经过调查，坚决支持了当地暂时处于少数地位的革命造反派。党内一小撮走资派对革命造反派实行残酷的镇压，并蒙蔽一部分群众，对我们进行围攻、谩骂。在这种情况下，我们对这种现象，只感到不对味，但是弄不清它的实质。于是，我们就反复学习毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”。通过学习，我们认识到，对待群众运动的态度，是毛主席革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的分水岭。毛主席的革命路线是相信和依靠群众，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己的路线；而中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人所推行的资产阶级反动路线却把矛头对准群众，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖。弄清了两条路线的实质后，我们就心明眼亮，对毛主席的革命路线更加热爱，对资产阶级反动路线更加仇恨。我们遵照毛主席关于“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地”的教导，同党内一小撮走资派，同资产阶级反动路线，进行了针锋相对的斗争。党内一小撮走资派镇压革命群众的时候，我们就挺身而出，坚决做革命群众的后盾。我们认识到：保护革命群众，就是保卫毛主席的革命路线。同志们一致表示：为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，不管逆风多猛，恶浪多大，我们紧跟伟大领袖毛主席、坚决支持无产阶级革命派的立场决不动摇。
    我们在支左工作中，天天都会碰到很多问题，有的是人民内部矛盾，有的是敌我矛盾。比如在革命委员会成立以后，有人放风，叫喊要“砸烂派性革委会”。在这种复杂的情况面前，我们反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，并且遵照毛主席的教导，用阶级斗争观点分析了当时的情况。我们认识到：党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派和叛徒、特务，勾结社会上没有改造好的地富反坏右分子刮起一股右倾翻案妖风，妄图搞垮新生的革命政权，复辟资本主义。我们同这一小撮阶级敌人的斗争，是你死我活的斗争。有些群众由于受了阶级敌人的蒙蔽，说了一些错话，做了一些错事，是认识问题，和阶级敌人的破坏有着本质的区别。对他们切不可用对待敌人的办法来处理，而应当用毛泽东思想去教育他们，使他们迅速回到毛主席革命路线上来，成为对敌斗争的一分力量。由于分清了敌我，我们团结了广大群众，把一个个坏人揪了出来，打退了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，彻底粉碎了右倾翻案妖风。在同阶级敌人的激烈斗争中，我们的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，提到了一个新的水平。
    斗私批修，是我们提高两条路线斗争觉悟的根本途径
    毛主席教导我们：“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。”我们在支左斗争实践中深深体会到，“私”字是阻碍我们执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线的大敌。毛主席的革命路线，代表着无产阶级和广大劳动人民的根本利益，是为公的路线。“私”字当头，就不能正确理解毛主席的革命路线，就不能在任何情况下坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，就不能为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而英勇战斗。只有不断破私立公，才能不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟。因此，我们遵照毛主席“不破不立”的教导，不断破除阻碍我们正确执行毛主席革命路线的私心杂念，彻底改造世界观，努力把党委建设成无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的战斗集体。
    破私立公，要靠自觉。高度的自觉性，是解决思想矛盾、提高两条路线斗争觉悟的内在因素。怎样才能做到自觉地破私立公呢？我们的体会是，必须把破私立公提到两条路线斗争的高度来认识，使大家真正懂得，能不能自觉地破私立公，是能不能忠于毛主席革命路线的大问题。这样，大家就能主动抓“纲”上、“线”上的活思想，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，以“挖山不止”的顽强毅力，向“私”字打进攻战。我们刚执行支左任务时，个别同志有时不够大胆，表现在处理某些问题时瞻前顾后，不能坚定地执行毛主席的革命路线。林副主席说，毛主席的革命路线，是“敢”字当头的路线。我们联系支左斗争的实际反复学习林副主席这一指示，认识到，“敢”和“怕”是两条路线斗争觉悟高低的表现。为了破掉“怕”字，树立“敢”字，我们反复学习了毛主席关于“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”的教导，深挖了“怕”的思想根子，狠斗了头脑中的“私”字。我们还回忆了跟着毛主席干革命的战斗经历，大家说，过去，为了保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的革命路线，我们在枪林弹雨下，面不改色心不跳；今天，在同资产阶级和一切剥削阶级继续作斗争的时候，更应该无所畏惧，英勇战斗。由于斗掉了“怕”字，树立了“敢”字，我们誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的决心更坚强了，同志们坚决表示：生为捍卫毛主席革命路线战斗，死为捍卫毛主席革命路线献身。一次，我们党委的一位同志要去接见外地来的革命造反派，事先得知当地走资派要操纵保守势力进行围攻的消息，革命小将劝他不要去，他说：“革命不怕死，怕死不革命！遇到艰险就退缩，怎能算得忠于毛主席的革命路线！”他用自己的革命行动，有力地支持了革命造反派。
    林副主席说：“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同资产阶级反动路线，是水火不相容的。只有彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，清除这条路线的影响，才能正确地、完全地、彻底地执行毛主席的路线。”我们遵照林副主席的指示，把破私立公同革命大批判结合起来。去年一个时期，当地党内一小撮走资派蒙蔽群众，大肆攻击我们支持革命左派是支持了“右派势力”。面对这种情况，我们一方面学习毛主席的最新指示，提高认识；一方面狠批资产阶级反动路线，狠斗头脑中的“私”字，更加坚定了执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线的决心。当地革命委员会成立以后，我们党委中有的同志产生了“歇一口气”的思想。我们便以毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论进行了批判。在批判中，同志们大摆阶级斗争的新形势、新动向、新特点，一致认识到，革命委员会成立以后，阶级斗争并没有结束，我们不但不能松劲，而且要更好地帮助革命委员会狠抓阶级斗争，更加深入地开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发动持久、猛烈的进攻，保卫新生的革命委员会。在斗私批修中，我们的两条路线斗争觉悟进一步得到了提高。
    群众斗争的大风雨，是我们提高两条路线斗争觉悟的好课堂
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”我们深深体会到，群众斗争的大风雨，是我们提高两条路线斗争觉悟的好课堂，广大革命群众是我们提高两条路线斗争觉悟的好老师。有件事深深地教育了我们：我们党委的一位同志，由于对毛主席关于实现革命大联合的最新指示理解不深，说了一些不利于革命大联合的话，革命造反派当即指出他的话是与毛主席的革命路线相违背的。我们立即把革命造反派的同志请来，和他们一起学习毛主席的最新指示，虚心地听取他们的意见，大大地加深了我们对毛主席关于实现革命大联合的最新指示的理解，深深感到我们脑子里两条路线斗争的弦不如革命造反派绷得紧，两条路线斗争觉悟没有他们那么高。通过这件事情，我们更加清楚地认识到：广大革命群众对毛主席最忠，对毛泽东思想领会最深，跟毛主席的革命路线最紧，他们有把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的坚强决心，这是高度的两条路线斗争觉悟的表现。老老实实地向革命群众学习，就能提高我们的两条路线斗争觉悟。从此，我们更加自觉地投身到伟大的群众斗争中去，虚心向群众学习。
    向群众学习，首先要在思想上把自己摆在小学生的位置上。有的党委成员有时以领导者自居，不能虚心向群众学习。我们反复学习了毛主席关于“我们应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习”的教导，更加明确地认识到：我们同群众的关系，是共同活学活用毛泽东思想，共同执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线的团结战斗的关系。在用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命群众面前，我们永远是毕不了业的小学生。位置摆对了，我们向群众学习的自觉性更高了。我们经常和革命群众一起学习毛主席著作，在共同战斗中虚心学习他们敢于顶逆风、战恶浪，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的崇高品质，主动听取他们的批评和意见，自觉地在群众斗争中检验自己的思想言行，不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟。
    当我们在贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的过程中做出了一些成绩，受到群众赞扬的时候，我们党委反复学习毛主席关于“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”和“不要吃老本，要立新功”的教导，认识到：成绩应该归功于伟大领袖毛主席，归功于广大革命群众，绝不能以为自己的两条路线斗争觉悟已经很高了，就骄傲自满起来，而是要更加虚心地向群众学习，更加努力地提高两条路线斗争觉悟。这样，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。于是，我们更广泛地深入到群众中，虚心听取群众的批评，征求群众对我们的意见，和广大革命群众一起，大办毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展革命大批判，使我们的两条路线斗争觉悟得到了进一步提高。同志们深有感触地说：“对革命群众越亲，跟毛主席就越紧；对革命群众越爱，提高两条路线斗争觉悟就越快。”
    最近，我们怀着崇敬的心情，认真学习了门合同志的光辉事迹，深深为门合同志无限忠于毛主席革命路线的崇高品质所感动。和门合同志相比，我们的两条路线斗争觉悟差得很远很远。我们坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，向门合同志学习，努力活学活用毛泽东思想，进一步提高两条路线斗争觉悟，一辈子为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗！
