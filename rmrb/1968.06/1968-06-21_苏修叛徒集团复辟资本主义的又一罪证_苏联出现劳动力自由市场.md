	Soviet revisionist traitor clique's another crime in restoring capitalism: the appearance of a free labor market in the Soviet Union

	New China News Agency, June 20th: Moscow reports that due to the Soviet revisionist leadership's comprehensive restoration of capitalism in various sectors of the national economy, the employment situation in the Soviet Union is deteriorating, and many people are falling into the miserable state of unemployment.

	To adapt to the full implementation of the "new economic system" centered on capitalist profit principles and to alleviate the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of unemployed people towards the reactionary rule of revisionism, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique recently formally established an official job introduction agency in Moscow - the "Labor Resources Utilization Management Bureau," openly organizing a free labor market by official means, further strengthening the control and exploitation of workers.

	The Soviet revisionist newspapers even praise this rubbish from capitalist society as if it were a great achievement, claiming that those who have graduated from training classes, technical schools, colleges, and high schools but have no jobs, can find work by just going to the "Labor Arrangement Office" or "Management Bureau." The newspapers also boast that "every district in Moscow has labor arrangement offices and personnel to help find jobs for those in need." This "job introduction" organization "has firmly established itself" and "will have a bright future." This shows that the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, in order to create the free labor market needed to promote the "new system," has gone so far down the road of commodifying labor.

	However, some officials in the Soviet revisionist clique are brazenly lying, denying the reality of mass unemployment among Soviet workers, claiming that "in many regions, the human resources have actually been fully exploited." The news of the opening of the official job introduction offices directly exposes their lies.

    苏修叛徒集团复辟资本主义的又一罪证
    苏联出现劳动力自由市场
    新华社二十日讯　莫斯科消息：由于苏修领导集团在国民经济各部门全面复辟资本主义的结果，目前苏联劳动就业情况越来越糟，各地有许多劳动人民陷入失业悲惨境地。
    为了适应全面推行以资本主义利润原则为核心的“新经济体制”的需要和缓和广大失业者对修正主义反动统治的不满，苏修叛徒集团不久前在莫斯科正式设立了一个官办的介绍职业的机构——“劳动资源利用管理局”，公然由官方出面来组织劳动力的自由市场，进一步加强对工人的控制和剥削。
    苏修的报纸竟把这种从资本主义社会贩来的破烂货吹得天花乱坠，说什么“在训练班、技术学校、学院和中学毕了业”而没有工作的人，只要到“劳动安排站”或“管理局”去一趟，“就能找到工作”。报纸还吹嘘“莫斯科的每个区都有了劳动安排站和帮助找到需要工作的受托人员”。这种“介绍职业”的组织“已经稳固地站住了脚跟”，“将会有广阔的前程”。这说明苏修叛徒集团为了创造推行“新体制”所需要的劳动力自由市场，在劳动力商品化的道路上已走得多么遥远。
    但是，苏修集团的一些当权人物却瞪着眼睛吹牛皮，否认苏联工人大批失业的现实，硬说什么“现在许多地区人力来源实际上已经挖掘完了”。苏修官办职业介绍所开张的消息，就直接戳穿了他们的谎言。
