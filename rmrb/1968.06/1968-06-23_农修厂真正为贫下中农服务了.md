The Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory Truly Serves the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

In Guizhou Province's Anshun City, there is an agricultural machinery repair factory. As the name suggests, it is meant to serve agricultural production. However, before the Cultural Revolution, the city's capitalist roaders, following the black directives of China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism, led the factory astray. They were always thinking about profits and how much money they could make. As a result, the repair factory did not actively repair agricultural machinery for the rural people's communes but instead focused on repairing trucks, oil tanks, and other large equipment for state-owned enterprises. Farmers criticized the repair factory for "hanging a sheep's head to sell dog meat, not doing its proper job," but this did not attract the factory's attention.

After the revolutionary committee was established, they vigorously carried out revolutionary criticism: against China's Khrushchev's "profit-first" and "material incentives" black guidelines for running enterprises, they launched a relentless attack. The entire factory's revolutionary workers firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Politics is the command, it is the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." They resolutely declared: the agricultural machinery repair factory must face the countryside and serve the collective economy of the rural people's communes, and it must not waver because of how much money it makes.

Revolutionary criticism corrected the factory's operational direction. The revolutionary committee then led the broad revolutionary masses to criticize the old operational style. In the past, under the control of the city's capitalist roaders, the factory leadership would push back or delay repairs for agricultural units, require them to bring their own materials, and pay a deposit... There were countless rules and regulations.

"Break first, and establish within the break." After the revolutionary criticism, the factory's operational style was completely different from the past. As soon as they heard that the rural people's commune had sent equipment for repair, they would do everything possible to repair it as soon as it arrived. For other non-agricultural equipment, they would only accept it on the condition that it would not delay the repair of agricultural machinery. In the past, due to the city's capitalist roaders promoting China's Khrushchev's "material incentives" and other black goods, some workers could earn "overproduction bonuses" for repairing trucks and oil tanks, so they were willing to do this kind of work; agricultural equipment had many specifications, was troublesome to repair, and did not easily earn bonuses, so they were not willing to repair it. After the proletarian revolutionaries took power, they criticized "material incentives" and other black goods, and everyone decided to abolish the "overproduction bonuses." Workers all rushed to repair agricultural equipment, taking it as their honor to serve the collective economy of agriculture and the poor and lower-middle peasants.

This early spring, the Qing Mountain Reservoir in Puding County came to process a "silt fence," requiring it to be completed before the flood season. Processing the "silt fence" requires small round steel, but the processing unit only had angle steel, and the factory also lacked round steel. What to do? The revolutionary committee left the difficulties for themselves and took on the job. They sent people to other units to coordinate and helped solve the material problem, then rushed the processing, and finally ensured the reservoir's urgent needs. Once, the Jichang Commune in Puding County came to process a reservoir gate. After it was completed, the processing unit temporarily could not find a large truck to transport it back, and the reservoir was urgently waiting for installation. The revolutionary committee then borrowed a truck and sent the factory's driver to actively deliver the reservoir gate to the Jichang Commune. The poor and lower-middle peasants saw this and said with emotion: Now, the agricultural machinery repair factory truly serves us poor and lower-middle peasants!

Today, this column reports on a factory and a supply and marketing cooperative's transformation in operational direction and style. This transformation once again vividly illustrates: The revolutionary committee is good!

In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party promoted China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, causing some factories and enterprises to go astray. Now, revolutionary committees at all levels are everywhere guided by Mao Zedong Thought, consciously implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thus correcting the operational direction of some factory and enterprise units, making them firmly advance along the socialist path.

"Without destruction, there is no construction; without blocking, there is no flow; without stopping, there is no progress." To implement and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, it is necessary to criticize and smash China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The more thoroughly the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line is eliminated, the better Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can be implemented.

The revolutionary committees of Anshun City's Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory and Xitao Supply and Marketing Cooperative have raised the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, leading the broad revolutionary masses to carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism. This is the fundamental reason why their work has been so effective.

### 农修厂真正为贫下中农服务了

    农修厂真正为贫下中农服务了
    贵州省安顺市有个农业机械修配厂。顾名思义，它是为农业生产服务的。可是，在文化大革命以前，市里的走资派秉承其黑主子中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的黑意旨，把这个工厂的经营方向引上了邪路。他们整天想的就是利润高低，赚钱多少。结果，农修厂不积极为农村人民公社修理农业机械，却光想给国营企业修理汽车、油罐等大型设备。农民批评农修厂“挂羊头，卖狗肉，不务正业”，但是并没有引起农修厂的注意。
    厂革命委员会成立以后，狠抓革命的大批判：对中国赫鲁晓夫的“利润挂帅”“物质刺激”等修正主义办企业的黑纲领，来了个穷追猛打。全厂革命职工牢记毛主席的教导：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”他们斩钉截铁地表示：农修厂就是要面向农村，为农村人民公社集体经济服务，绝不能因为赚钱多少而有所动摇。
    革命大批判端正了工厂的经营方向。厂革委会接着又领导广大革命群众批判了旧的经营作风。过去，工厂领导在市里走资派的控制下，对农业单位送来修理的东西能推就推，不能推就拖，要自带原材料，要交预修金……数不尽的清规戒律。
      “破字当头，立也就在其中了。”经过革命的大批判，厂里的经营作风跟过去大不相同。只要一听说是农村人民公社送来修理的设备，都千方百计随到随修。其它非农业方面的设备，在保证不耽误检修农业机械的前提下才接受。过去，由于市里的走资派推行中国赫鲁晓夫的“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货，有的职工因为修汽车、油罐，可以拿“超产奖”，愿意干这类活；农业设备规格多，修起来费事，不容易得奖，就不愿意修。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，批判了“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货，大家决定取消了“超产奖”。职工们都争先检修农业设备，把为农业集体经济服务、为贫下中农服务当作自己的光荣职责。
    今年初春，普定县青山水库来加工“拦污栅”，要求在洪水季节到来之前做好。加工“拦污栅”需要小圆钢，而加工单位只有角钢，厂里圆钢也缺。怎么办？厂革委会把困难留给自己，把活接了下来。他们派人到外单位联系，帮助解决了材料问题，然后又抓紧加工，终于保证了水库的急需。有一次，普定县鸡场公社前来加工水库闸门。做好以后，加工单位一时找不到大卡车往回运，而水库又急等安装。厂革委会就代借了一辆卡车，派了厂里的驾驶员，主动把水库闸门送到鸡场公社。贫下中农看了，感动地说：现在的农修厂，可真正是为我们贫下中农服务了！

    今天在这个专栏里报道了一个工厂、一个供销社在经营方向、经营作风上的转变。这种转变又一次生动地说明了：革命委员会好！
    过去，党内一小撮走资派推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，使一些工厂企业走上了邪路。现在，各级革命委员会处处用毛泽东思想挂帅，自觉地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，这就端正了一些工厂企业单位的经营方向，使他们坚定地沿着社会主义道路前进。
    “不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。要贯彻和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就必须批判和粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。反革命修正主义路线的流毒肃清得越彻底，就能把毛主席的无产阶级革命路线贯彻执行得越好。
    安顺市的农业机械修配厂和西陶供销合作社的革命委员会，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判的大旗，带领广大革命群众持久深入地开展革命大批判，这是他们的工作做得卓有成效的根本原因。
