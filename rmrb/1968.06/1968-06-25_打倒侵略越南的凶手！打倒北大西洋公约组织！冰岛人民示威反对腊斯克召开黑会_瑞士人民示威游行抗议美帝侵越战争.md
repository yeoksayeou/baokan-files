	Down with the aggressors invading Vietnam! Down with NATO!
	Icelandic people demonstrate against Rusk's secret meeting
	Swiss people march in protest against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam

	Our reporter informs that on the 23rd, the people of Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, held an anti-U.S. demonstration to protest against the arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Rusk and other heads of NATO member countries to hold a ministerial council meeting.

	According to reports, hundreds of demonstrators held up signs reading "Down with the aggressors invading Vietnam!" "Down with NATO!" and "Close the U.S. bases!" and marched along a 35-mile coastal road.

	The march began at the U.S. military base in Keflavik and arrived in Reykjavik by evening. On the 24th, when the NATO secret meeting opened, they held a protest rally.

	This NATO ministerial council meeting was held after the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists manipulated the UN General Assembly to pass the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty," preparing to further intensify counter-revolutionary collusion. According to Western news agencies, the agenda for this meeting includes issues such as "easing East-West relations, encouraging a comprehensive political solution in Europe, and easing the arms race." This shows that U.S. imperialism is trying to use this meeting to rally its Western allies to make bigger counter-revolutionary deals with the Soviet revisionist clique.

	Our reporter informs that on the 22nd, the Swiss people held widespread demonstrations to oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.

	In Bellinzona, the capital of the Ticino canton in Switzerland, hundreds of people participating in the anti-U.S. demonstration were in high spirits and clashed with police and pro-U.S. reactionaries who came to suppress the demonstration. One police officer was struck in the head.

	According to reports, in Geneva, Bern, and Lausanne, demonstrators had already placed the flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on the spires of city churches before dawn, expressing their support for the South Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression.

    打倒侵略越南的凶手！打倒北大西洋公约组织！
    冰岛人民示威反对腊斯克召开黑会
    瑞士人民示威游行抗议美帝侵越战争
    本报讯　冰岛首都雷克雅未克人民二十三日举行反美示威，抗议美国国务卿腊斯克等北大西洋侵略集团成员国的头头们前来举行部长理事会。
    据报道，数百名示威群众举着打倒侵略越南的凶手！“打倒北大西洋公约组织！”和“关闭美国基地！”等标语，在长达三十五英里的沿海公路上举行示威游行。
    游行队伍从驻有美国军队的凯夫拉维克军事基地出发，在傍晚前到达雷克雅未克，并在二十四日北大西洋侵略集团的黑会开幕时举行抗议集会。
    北大西洋侵略集团这次部长理事会，是在美帝苏修操纵联大通过所谓
  “防止核扩散”条约以后，准备进一步全面加紧反革命勾结时举行的。据西方通讯社透露，这次会议的议程，包括所谓“缓和东西方关系、鼓励在欧洲实行一项总的政治解决并缓和军备竞赛”等问题。这表明，美帝国主义力图通过这次会议纠合它的西方伙伴，来同苏修叛徒集团做更大的反革命交易。
    本报讯　瑞士人民二十二日举行广泛示威，反对美帝国主义侵略越南战争。
    在瑞士提契诺州的首府贝林佐纳，参加反美示威的数百人群情激昂，同前来镇压示威的警察和亲美反动分子发生了冲突，一名警察头部被击中。
    据报道，在日内瓦、伯尔尼和洛桑等地，示威群众在清晨以前就把越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜插上了城市教堂的尖塔顶上，表示对越南南方人民抗美救国战争的支持。
