	Criticizing the Bourgeois "Suffering-Happiness" View
	Down-to-the-Countryside Youth from Yangcaogou Production Brigade, Xinmin County, Liaoning Province, Chang Guangrong

	Enduring hardships and toiling hard is the essence of a revolutionary. However, Liu Shaoqi, the Chinese Khrushchev, has been peddling the bourgeois "suffering-happiness" view to us youth. He blathers on about:

	"Suffering first, enjoying later... They temporarily suffer a bit, but they are, or will be, trusted and respected by us all and the masses. In other words, they are the most worthy."

	This is to make us youth, with minds full of "self," pursue personal fame, profit, and status by enduring some hardships, thereby deceiving the Party and the people into trusting them, and in return, gaining fame and fortune. This is a poison that corrupts people's souls.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, that is where we should go to solve them. We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go there. That is what a good comrade does." The sixteen youth from our brigade in Yangcaogou have always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, regarding enduring hardships for the revolution as the essence of a proletarian revolutionary. For four years, we have been going out early and returning late, facing wind and rain, fighting alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants. Wherever it is the hardest, we go there; wherever it is the most difficult, we charge forward. One day last summer, I and the villagers went to the cattle pen to collect manure. The sun was blazing, the weather was scorching, and the manure was slimy and bubbling, emitting a pungent, foul smell. At that moment, I did not hesitate to take off my shoes, roll up my pants, and with tools in hand, jump into the manure soup that reached my knees to collect manure. This spring, when the brigade was repairing the irrigation station, the work was quite arduous. Several female comrades, including Tian Suju, volunteered to participate. Every day, they dug mud and carried soil with the male villagers, their hands blistered and swollen without a word of pain, their shoulders swollen without a word of complaint. Everyone said, we are enduring hardships for the Chinese revolution, for the world revolution, for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, for defending Chairman Mao, for defending Mao Zedong Thought, and for defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is the greatest sweetness, the greatest joy, and the greatest honor. We have never thought that enduring personal hardships is some kind of "suffering a loss," nor have we ever thought, as Chinese Khrushchev desperately advocates, that enduring hardships now is for gaining fame and profit later, "reaping great benefits."

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Winning nationwide victory is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li.... The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous." We deeply understand that without the spirit of hard struggle and thorough revolution, we cannot adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Without the hard struggle of the past, there would be no victory today; without the hard struggle of today, there would be no victory for all the people of the world tomorrow. We youth in the vast countryside must pay hard efforts to struggle against nature, against the environment, and against people. But this is the need of the revolution. Doing revolution means not fearing hardships.

	For whom do we endure hardships, and why do we endure hardships? Different classes have different answers, which reflect two different worldviews. Heroes like Zhang Zedong and Jiao Yulu willingly endure hardships for the people and the revolution. They are true proletarian revolutionaries. If a person endures hardships with the purpose of pursuing personal fame, profit, and status, then he can only temporarily deceive the Party and the people into trusting him, but he will never truly serve the people. Such a person is a captive of the bourgeois "suffering-happiness" view advocated by Chinese Khrushchev.

	We, the youth who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, will never fall for Chinese Khrushchev's tricks! We will contribute to the cause of socialism and communism in our country, contribute to the happiness of all working people, and contribute to the liberation of all the people of the world. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism, and throw Chinese Khrushchev and his bourgeois "suffering-happiness" view into the garbage heap of history! We will remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "suffering before others and enjoying after others," inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle of our Party, and forever maintain the essence of a revolutionary!

    批臭资产阶级苦乐观
    辽宁省新民县羊草沟大队下乡知识青年　常广荣
    吃大苦，耐大劳，是我们革命者的本色。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫向我们青年大肆兜售“先吃苦后享福”的资产阶级苦乐观。他胡说什么：
  “吃苦在前，享福在后……他们暂时吃一点亏，然而他们是，或者最后是，为我们大家及群众所信任，所尊敬，也就是说，他们是最值得的。”这就是要我们青年带着满脑袋“私”字，抱着追求个人名利地位的目的去吃点苦，以此骗取党和人民对自己的“信任”，从而换得名利双收。这是毒害人们灵魂的腐蚀剂。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”我们在羊草沟大队的十六名知识青年，时刻牢记毛主席的教导，把为革命吃苦看成是无产阶级革命者的本色，四年如一日，早出晚归，风来雨去，和贫下中农战斗在一起。哪里最艰苦，我们就往哪里上；哪里最困难，我们就向哪里冲。去年夏季的一天，我和社员去牛圈起粪。烈日当空，天气酷热，牛粪稀糊糊直冒泡，发出刺鼻的酸臭味。当时，我毫不犹豫地脱去鞋子，卷起裤腿，拿着工具跳下没膝深的粪汤子里去起粪。今年春天，队里修排灌站，活计比较艰苦，田素菊等几名女同志主动报名参加。她们每天和男社员一样挖泥、挑土，手磨出血泡不说痛，肩压肿了不叫苦。大家都说，我们是在为中国革命、世界革命吃苦，是在为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利吃苦，是在为保卫毛主席、保卫毛泽东思想、保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线吃苦，这就是最大的甜，最大的愉快，最大的光荣。我们从来没有想到个人吃点苦就是什么“吃亏”，更没有想过象中国赫鲁晓夫所拚命宣扬的那样，现在吃点苦是为了将来得名得利，“占大便宜”。
    毛主席教导我们：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”我们深深地懂得，没有艰苦奋斗、彻底革命的精神，就不能坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。没有过去的艰苦奋斗，就没有今天的胜利；没有今天的艰苦奋斗，也就没有明天全世界人民的胜利。我们知识青年在农村这个广阔的天地里，与天斗，与地斗，与人斗，是必须付出艰辛努力的。但是，这是革命的需要。干革命就是要不怕吃苦。
    为谁吃苦，为什么吃苦，不同的阶级有不同的回答，这正反映出两种不同的世界观。张思德、焦裕禄等英雄人物，心甘情愿地为人民为革命去吃苦，他们是一个真正的无产阶级革命战士。如果一个人抱着追求个人名利地位的目的去吃苦，那末他只能为骗取党和人民的信任一时伪装积极，而绝不会真正地为人民服务。这种人就是中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“先吃苦后享福”的资产阶级苦乐观的俘虏。
    我们无限忠于毛主席的革命青年，坚决不上中国赫鲁晓夫的当！我们要为我国的社会主义、共产主义的事业作出贡献，要为全体劳动人民的幸福作出贡献，要为全世界人民的解放作出贡献。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，持久深入地开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫连同他的“先吃苦后享福”的资产阶级苦乐观一起抛进历史的垃圾堆！我们要牢记毛主席“吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头”的教导，继承和发扬我们党艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，永远保持革命者的本色！
