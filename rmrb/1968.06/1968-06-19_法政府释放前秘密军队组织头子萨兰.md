The French government has released the former leader of the Secret Army Organization in Algeria, Salan. According to a report from the French newspaper *Le Monde*, the French authorities issued a statement on the 15th announcing the release of Salan. Salan was arrested in 1961 for activities against De Gaulle. Along with Salan, ten other former French military officers who opposed De Gaulle were also released.

Western news agencies and newspapers believe that the French government's action in the current situation is aimed at strengthening its relations with the French military, in exchange for the military's "guarantee" to suppress the revolutionary movements of the French masses.

    法政府释放前秘密军队组织头子萨兰
    据法国《世界报》报道，法国统治当局十五日发表的一项公报，宣布释放法国前在阿尔及利亚的秘密军队组织头子萨兰。萨兰是在一九六一年由于进行反对戴高乐的活动而被捕的。和萨兰一起被释放的，还有另外十个反对戴高乐的前法国军官。
    西方通讯社和报纸认为，法国政府在目前局势中采取这一行动，是为了加强同法国军队的“关系”，以换取军队镇压法国革命群众运动的“保证”。
