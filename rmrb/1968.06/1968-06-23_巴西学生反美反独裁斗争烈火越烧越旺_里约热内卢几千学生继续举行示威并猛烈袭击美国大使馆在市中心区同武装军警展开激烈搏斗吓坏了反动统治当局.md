	Brazilian students' struggle against American imperialist cultural aggression and pro-American dictatorship is intensifying. On June 21, students in Rio de Janeiro held a third consecutive day of intense demonstrations, striking fear into the hearts of the reactionary ruling class. Students hurled stones, sticks, and bottles at the American embassy and engaged in fierce battles with heavily armed military police in the city center.

	Several thousand university students in Rio de Janeiro first demonstrated in front of Brazil's cultural and educational department on June 21, chanting slogans against the dictatorship and calling for the overthrow of American imperialism. The march then proceeded to the American embassy, where students pelted the building with bricks and stones, shattering 23 windows and forcing staff to evacuate the first and second floors. In the city's main street, Avenida Rio Branco, students set up eight barricades using overturned cars and scaffolding from under-construction buildings to resist the fully armed state police. From behind the barricades, students rained down stones and bricks on the advancing police, while others on nearby skyscrapers threw bricks, stones, and broken bottles, catching the police in a crossfire. The police, wearing helmets, were caught off guard and repeatedly retreated into buildings for cover. The battle between university students and reactionary police turned the bustling area into a fierce battlefield.

	The panicked Brazilian dictatorship ordered a bloody crackdown on the students. They deployed helicopters to direct the suppression, ordering state police to fire tear gas and repeatedly shoot into the crowd. One female student and two male students were killed on the spot. Additionally, at least 50 people were injured by the reactionary police, many seriously. The police also arrested over 100 demonstrators. The police's brutal suppression only fueled greater anger among the students, who fought back against the police for several hours, destroying nine official vehicles, one of which was set on fire. Witnesses reported that due to the students' brave and tenacious resistance, the state police had completely lost control of the situation. Onlookers in nearby skyscrapers jeered at the police, who were in disarray.

	The previous day (June 20), students who had occupied the administrative building of the University of Rio de Janeiro were brutally attacked by police as they left the building. The students fought back with bottles and sticks. Police shot and injured 15 students and arrested hundreds more.

	Currently, the atmosphere in Rio de Janeiro is tense. Brazil's dictatorial regime held an emergency meeting with the ministers of the army, navy, and air force on June 21 to discuss further strengthening the crackdown. There are reports that the dictatorship may deploy regular troops to suppress the raging student movement.

	Meanwhile, on June 20, students, teachers, and intellectuals in São Paulo held a march and demonstration, protesting the dictatorship's educational policies and demanding increased funding for education.

	In the state capitals of Salvador in Bahia and Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais, thousands of university students also held marches, demonstrations, and meetings to protest the government's policy of educational subjugation.

	The Brazilian reactionaries foolishly believe they can extinguish the students' just struggle through violence. However, the deeper the oppression, the stronger the resistance. The Brazilian students, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, will not be cowed by violence. They are tightly united and are pushing their anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggle to new heights.

    巴西学生反美反独裁斗争烈火越烧越旺
    里约热内卢几千学生继续举行示威并猛烈袭击美国大使馆在市中心区同武装军警展开激烈搏斗吓坏了反动统治当局
    据新华社二十二日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西大学生反对美帝国主义文化侵略、反对亲美独裁统治的爱国正义斗争正在一浪高过一浪地猛烈发展中。二十一日，巴西里约热内卢的学生连续第三天举行了使巴西反动派胆战心惊的激烈大示威。学生们用石头、木棍和瓶子等猛烈袭击美国大使馆，并且同野蛮残暴的巴西军警进行顽强的搏斗。
    里约热内卢几千名大学生二十一日中午首先在巴西文化教育部门前示威，高呼反对独裁统治和打倒美帝国主义的口号。然后游行队伍开向美国大使馆，用大量石块和砖头猛烈袭击这个美帝国主义的代表机构，砸碎了二十三扇玻璃窗，并且迫使里面的人员撤离了一二层楼。示威学生在市中心的主要大街——里约布朗库大街上用翻倒的汽车和正在建筑的大楼的脚手架筑起了八个街垒，抵抗全副武装的州警察的进攻。他们从街垒后面用雨点般的石块、砖头迎击向他们冲击的警察，同时另一部分学生从街两旁的摩天大楼上居高临下对准警察投掷砖头、石块和碎瓶子等各种物件，使头戴钢盔的警察处于四面夹击，被打得狼狈不堪，一再跑进楼房里躲避。大学生同反动警察之间的搏斗使这个闹市区变成了一个激烈的战场。
    惊惶失措的巴西独裁当局下令对学生进行血腥的镇压。他们出动直升飞机指挥镇压行动，指使州警察不但疯狂发射催泪弹，并且一再野蛮地向示威的人群开枪射击，当场打死一名女学生和两名男学生。此外，据报道，至少有五十人被反动警察打伤，其中有不少人伤势严重。警察还逮捕了一百多名示威学生。警察的残暴镇压激起了学生们更大的愤怒，他们同警察英勇奋战了好几个小时，砸烂了九部官方的车辆，其中一辆被点火焚烧。据报道，许多目击者说，由于学生们英勇顽强的战斗，州警察已经完全失去了对局势的控制。在街道两旁摩天大楼上观战的人群，不断向被学生打得狼狈不堪的警察发出嘲笑声。
    前一天（二十日）占领里约热内卢大学行政大楼的学生在离开大楼时受到警察的野蛮袭击，但是学生们用酒瓶和棍棒予以回击。警察开枪打伤了十五名学生，逮捕了好几百名学生。
    目前，里约热内卢气氛紧张。巴西独裁政权的司法部长在二十一日学生游行示威发生后同海陆空三军部长紧急会谈，讨论进一步加强镇压的问题。有消息说，独裁当局可能出动正规军来对付烈火燎原般的学生斗争。
    与此同时，圣保罗的大、中学生、教员和知识分子二十日晚也举行了游行示威，抗议独裁当局的教育政策，要求增加教育经费。
    在巴伊亚州首府萨尔瓦多、米纳斯吉拉斯州首府贝洛奥里藏特等重要城市的数千名大学生也先后举行游行示威和集会，抗议当局的奴化教育政策。
    巴西反动派妄想靠暴力镇压来扑灭学生们的正义斗争。但是，压迫愈深，反抗愈烈。富有光荣革命传统的巴西学生不为暴力所屈服，他们紧密团结，把反美反独裁斗争推向新的高潮。
