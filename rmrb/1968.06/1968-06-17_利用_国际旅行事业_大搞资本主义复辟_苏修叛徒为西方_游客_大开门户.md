According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 13th, a message from Moscow: The Soviet revisionist clique is becoming increasingly brazen in using "international tourism" to attract all sorts of "tourists" from the capitalist world, allowing them to spread decadent Western lifestyles in the Soviet Union and poison the Soviet people.

Ever since Khrushchev usurped the leadership of the Soviet Party and government, the Soviet revisionist clique has used the banners of "peaceful coexistence" and "cultural exchange" to exploit "international tourism" to serve its policy of capitulating to imperialism internationally and restoring capitalism domestically. Thanks to Khrushchev's revisionist efforts, "tourists" from capitalist countries swarmed into the Soviet Union. The new Soviet leadership that came to power did not merely inherit Khrushchev's legacy in this regard but went even further. In the past few years, the number of Western "tourists" visiting the Soviet Union has increased manifold.

To attract Western "tourists" and allow them to spread capitalist lifestyles, the Soviet revisionist leadership has spared no expense in sending large quantities of related advertisements and promotional materials abroad, holding press conferences in foreign countries, and showcasing propaganda films at numerous international expositions. At the same time, the Soviet revisionist clique has simplified entry procedures and signed contracts with hundreds of travel agencies in capitalist countries, throwing open the doors to Western "tourists." Recently, the Soviet revisionists announced the opening of more than a hundred cities in all fifteen republics, increased tourist routes, established travel centers, and built hotels. To ensure that Western "tourists" have an "exciting and enjoyable" time during their stay in the Soviet Union, the Soviet revisionists have arranged a variety of decadent entertainment programs, even organizing them to "hunt bears in Siberia" and "capture wild goats in Azerbaijan," allowing them to run amok on Soviet soil. The actions of the Soviet revisionist clique are a great insult to the Soviet people.

To tighten their collusion with American imperialism, the new Soviet leadership signed a humiliating Soviet-American consular treaty in 1964, guaranteeing that American "tourists" could do as they pleased in the Soviet Union. U.S. President Johnson issued a special statement praising the treaty for protecting Americans "traveling" in the Soviet Union. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk was overjoyed, issuing a statement that "this is a step that costs very little but is extremely beneficial to national interests."

As American and other Western "tourists" flooded into the Soviet Union, decadent "American civilization" and "Western culture" spread rampantly. Some "tourists" even used "travel" as a cover to engage in smuggling, theft, currency trading, and espionage and other nefarious plots and sabotage activities. Under the pernicious influence of "Western culture," many Soviet youth dressed in American-style eccentric clothing and became increasingly decadent. Many bourgeois goods popular in the West quickly made their way to the Soviet Union, poisoning the younger generation and ruining the Soviet Union. However, the manager of the Soviet International Travel Agency, Boychinko, shamelessly claimed that "travel and tourism are passports to peace."

The Soviet revisionist leadership oppresses and exploits the broad masses of Soviet working people to the fullest, while treating Western bourgeoisie with meticulous care, fully accommodating them and giving them a green light for their "peaceful infiltration" of the Soviet Union. No wonder the Western bourgeois lords and ladies unanimously praised the "warm welcome" of the Soviet revisionist clique, saying that it formed a stark contrast with the cold weather outside, and that "in the Soviet Union, it feels like being at home." The applause of the Western bourgeoisie once again powerfully proves that Khrushchev and his successors, Brezhnev and Kosygin, have become nothing less than loyal servants of international capital and traitors to the Soviet proletariat.

### 利用“国际旅行事业”大搞资本主义复辟  苏修叛徒为西方“游客”大开门户

    利用“国际旅行事业”大搞资本主义复辟
    苏修叛徒为西方“游客”大开门户
    据新华社十三日讯　莫斯科消息：苏修叛徒集团越来越露骨地利用“国际旅行事业”，大肆招徕西方资本主义世界的形形色色的“游客”，任由这些人在苏联国土上传播荒淫无耻的西方生活方式，毒害苏联人民。
    早在赫鲁晓夫篡夺了苏联党政领导权之后，苏修集团就打着“和平共处”和“文化交流”等招牌，利用“国际旅行事业”为其在国际上投降帝国主义，在国内复辟资本主义服务。由于赫鲁晓夫修正主义的卖力经营，到苏联“旅行”的西方资本主义国家的“游客”蜂拥而入。苏修新领导上台后，不但在这方面继承了赫鲁晓夫的衣钵，甚至走得更远。在过去的几年中，到苏联的西方“游客”成倍地增加。
    苏修领导集团为了招徕西方“游客”，让他们传播西方资本主义的生活方式，不惜工本地将大量的有关广告和宣传品寄往国外，在国外举行的记者招待会上，在许多国际博览会上，放映广告电影大肆宣传。同时，苏修集团还简化入境手续，并和资本主义国家的几百个旅行社订立合同关系，为西方“游客”大开门户。最近苏修还宣布开放全部十五个加盟共和国中的一百多个城市，并且增设游览路线，开辟旅行中心和兴建旅馆等。苏修为了使西方“游客”在苏联旅行期间过得“新鲜有趣，充满刺激和尽情享乐”，特意安排了名目繁多、腐朽糜烂的文娱节目，甚至组织他们“在西伯利亚猎熊”，“在阿塞拜疆捕捉野山羊”，任其在苏联的国土上恣意妄为。苏修叛徒集团的这种行径是对苏联人民的极大污辱。
    苏修新领导为了加紧同美帝国主义的勾结，在一九六四年卑躬屈膝地签订了一项保证美国“旅客”在苏联为所欲为的苏美领事条约。美国总统约翰逊特别发表了一个声明，赞扬这个条约将保护在苏联“旅行”的美国人。美国国务卿腊斯克更是喜形于色，发表声明说，“这是一个所花代价很小而却非常有利于国家利益的步骤”。
    随着美国和西方其他国家的“游客”涌入苏联，腐朽没落的“美国文明”、“西方文化”在苏联大肆传播。有些“游客”甚至打着“旅行”的幌子，大干走私、偷盗、买卖货币，以及进行间谍和不可告人的阴谋破坏活动。在“西方文化”的恶劣影响下，许多苏联男女青年穿上了美国式的奇装异服，越来越颓废。目前在西方流行的许多资产阶级货色，很快就传到了苏联，毒害着青年一代，把苏联糟塌得不成样子，而苏联国际旅行社的经理鲍伊钦科却恬不知耻地说什么“旅行游览是通向和平的护照”。
    苏修领导集团对广大苏联劳动人民尽其压迫剥削之能事，而对西方资产阶级却体贴入微，照顾备至，为他们对苏联的“和平渗透”大开绿灯。难怪那些西方资产阶级老爷、太太同声称赞苏修叛徒的“热情欢迎同室外的寒冷气候形成了鲜明强烈的对比”，“在苏联就好象在自己家里一样”。西方资产阶级的这些“喝采”，再次有力地证明赫鲁晓夫和他的继承者勃列日涅夫—柯西金之流已不折不扣地堕落为国际资本的忠实奴仆，是苏联无产阶级的可耻叛徒。
