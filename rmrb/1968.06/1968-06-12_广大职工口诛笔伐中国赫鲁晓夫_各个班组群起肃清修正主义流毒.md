The broad masses of workers at the Shanghai Silicone Sheet Factory are using their mouths and pens to condemn the Chinese Khrushchev. Each work team is rising up to purge the poison of revisionism.

The revolutionary workers of the entire factory are raising their class struggle and line struggle consciousness through active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the midst of class struggle. They are gradually building an iron wall in their minds to prevent and resist revisionism, and their enthusiasm for production is extremely high.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 11 — The Shanghai Silicone Sheet Factory, with work teams as the base, is deeply and sustainably carrying out revolutionary criticism. The class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary workers throughout the factory have greatly increased, and their enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high. The national production tasks have been overfulfilled. Broad masses of revolutionary workers see that the factory is everywhere full of a thriving revolutionary and production situation, their fighting spirit is more soaring, and their determination to carry out revolutionary criticism to the end is even greater.

The characteristic of this factory's deep and sustained revolutionary criticism with work teams as the base is to grasp the "live targets" and link with "live thoughts." Grasping the "live targets" means, in the course of revolutionary criticism of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, to link with the crimes of the capitalist roaders and a handful of class enemies in this unit. There are many advantages to carrying out criticism in this way: first, it is a face-to-face struggle, with an opponent and a target, morale is high, and courage is great; second, it is more closely linked with reality, fully exposing the harm and evil nature of revisionism, it can be touched, seen, deeply exposed, and thoroughly criticized; third, it makes the broad masses of revolutionary workers more clearly see the true face of a handful of class enemies, not be deceived, and not be fooled. Linking with live thoughts means linking with the problems that arise in each stage, such as the anarchist trend and the counter-revolutionary economicist wind, these are all the poison of revisionism. By grasping these problems, severely criticizing the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, purging the poison of revisionism, and raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses, the struggle, criticism, and reform of this unit is promoted.

The practical experience of the Shanghai Silicone Sheet Factory in carrying out revolutionary criticism with work teams as the base proves that carrying out work team criticism: first, can mobilize the broadest masses, with revolutionary workers participating in criticism and everyone receiving education; second, can expose revisionism from all aspects and corners, criticize deeply and thoroughly, and purge the poison cleanly; third, can better mobilize and organize revolutionary masses to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the course of criticism and struggle, raise the consciousness of two-line struggle, and build an iron wall in their minds to resist and prevent revisionism.

The specific experience of the Shanghai Silicone Sheet Factory in carrying out work team criticism is:

Grasp the situation, severely criticize a handful of class enemies

When this factory is deeply and sustainably carrying out work team revolutionary criticism, it always follows the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, keeps up with the situation, and takes the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party as the "live target," always directing the spearhead at the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, a handful of class enemies. Through the exposure and criticism of the revolutionary masses throughout the factory, it was found that the anarchist wind that blew in the previous stage originally came from the capitalist roaders within the factory. The revolutionary committee of the factory seized this "live target" and launched a struggle of criticism against the capitalist roaders and a handful of class enemies, raising the class consciousness of the workers. The entire factory saw a wave of voluntarily formulating agreements to seize revolution and promote production, further purging the poison of anarchism. When a rightist wind of reversing verdicts blew in society, the revolutionary committee of the factory immediately mobilized the masses to seriously study Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. Each work team, in combination with the specific situation of the factory, deeply carried out exposure and criticism activities. A small group used a large amount of facts to expose the capitalist roaders in the factory using various despicable means to deceive, win over, and buy off workers, carrying out counter-revolutionary plots to reverse verdicts. Workers, from living facts, saw that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more frantically the class enemies struggle, which further aroused the initiative of the workers in each small group to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism.

Grasp consolidation, continuously launch attacks on class enemies

Revolutionary criticism is a weapon of continuous attack on class enemies and consolidation of the newly born revolutionary committees. After a period of carrying out revolutionary criticism with work teams as the base, some comrades thought that the criticism had been done enough. In response to this situation, the factory revolutionary committee organized the revolutionary workers throughout the factory to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teaching that "one of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out criticism of revisionism," and also held struggle meetings, using living class struggle reality to educate the revolutionary masses, raising revolutionary vigilance and class struggle awareness. With the improvement of ideological understanding, revolutionary criticism presented a new situation. The factory revolutionary committee timely summarized the experience of typical small groups in large-scale study and large-scale criticism, held experience exchange meetings and on-site exchange meetings, introduced criticism experiences to each other, checked work, learned from each other, made up for shortcomings, and promoted the further deepening of criticism.

Grasp dynamics, give a fierce counterattack to class enemies

Grasping dynamics mainly means grasping the ideological dynamics of the broad revolutionary workers and the new trends of class struggle. For example, in the past period, a few workers thought that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution had been going on for two years, and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and other class enemies could not move. In response to this complacent and arrogant thought, the factory revolutionary committee timely seized the fact that class enemies were frantically counterattacking and settling old scores against the revolutionary masses, educating the revolutionary workers throughout the factory, further mobilizing them to discuss the class struggle situation in the factory, workshops, and work teams, and to expose various manifestations of class struggle. Many living class struggle facts made the revolutionary workers throughout the factory further understand that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao is a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. In this great revolutionary struggle, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory used Mao Zedong Thought as a telescope and microscope to observe the new trends of class struggle, repeatedly defeating the counterattacks of class enemies.

Severely grasp class education, promote revolutionary criticism

Last year, some workers in this factory were influenced by the anarchist thought in society, and there was a period of relaxation in study and slackening of labor discipline. In response to these situations, the factory revolutionary committee repeatedly propagated Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle" to all workers in the factory, and at the same time, starting from the contrast between the old and new societies and the remembrance of bitterness and sweetness, universally carried out the "five inspections" activity in the work team range—inspect whether they have unlimited love, belief, reverence, and loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought; inspect how they have studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions; inspect how they have actively learned and applied the "Three Constantly Read Articles"; inspect whether they have actively participated in the great criticism; inspect their understanding and attitude towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Through the remembrance of bitterness and sweetness and the "five inspections," everyone further aroused their boundless proletarian feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, further deepened their boundless hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, eliminated the influence of the anarchist trend, and further clarified the great significance of deeply and sustainably carrying out revolutionary criticism, thus powerfully promoting the further deepening of revolutionary criticism.

In carrying out work team criticism, this factory also achieved "three combinations" in methods: first, combining oral condemnation with written criticism, speaking out in meetings to expose, criticize, and struggle against class enemies face to face, and after the meeting, everyone writes, organizing criticism articles; second, combining large-scale study with large-scale criticism, widely and deeply carrying out the mass movement of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, and setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes; third, combining large-scale criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of this unit, fully mobilizing the masses to carry out struggle, criticism, and reform on the basis of deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism.

    上海矽钢片厂以班组为基点深入持久开展革命大批判
    广大职工口诛笔伐中国赫鲁晓夫
    各个班组群起肃清修正主义流毒
    革命职工在阶级斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟不断提高，在思想上逐步筑起防修、反修的钢铁长城，生产热情极为高涨
    据新华社上海十一日电　上海矽钢片厂以班组为基点，深入持久地开展革命大批判，全厂革命职工阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，生产热情空前高涨，国家生产任务超额完成。广大革命职工看到厂里到处呈现出生气勃勃的革命和生产的大好形势，斗志更加昂扬，把革命大批判进行到底的决心更大。
    这个厂以班组为基点深入开展革命大批判的特点是，抓住“活靶子”，联系“活思想”。抓住“活靶子”，就是在对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派进行革命大批判时，联系本单位的走资派和一小撮阶级敌人的罪行，这样开展批判好处很多，一是面对面的斗争，有对手，有目标，士气足，勇气高；二是更加结合实际，充分揭露修正主义的危害和罪恶本质，摸得到，看得见，揭得深，批得透；三是使广大革命职工更加认清一小撮阶级敌人的本来面目，不受迷惑，不会上当。联系活思想就是联系各个阶段出现的问题，如无政府主义思潮，反革命经济主义妖风等，这些都是修正主义的流毒，抓了这些问题，狠批党内一小撮走资派，肃清修正主义的流毒，提高了广大群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，推动了本单位的斗批改。
    上海矽钢片厂以班组为基点开展革命的大批判的实践经验证明，开展班组大批判，一能最广泛地发动群众，革命职工人人参加批判，人人受到教育；二能从各个方面、各个角落揭露修正主义，批得深，批得透，流毒肃得清；三能更好地动员和组织革命群众在批判斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，提高两条路线斗争的觉悟，在思想上筑起反修、防修的钢铁长城。
    上海矽钢片厂开展班组大批判的具体经验是：
    抓形势，狠批一小撮阶级敌人
    这个厂在深入持久地开展班组革命大批判的时候，始终紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，紧跟形势，以党内一小撮走资派为“活靶子”，一直把矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人等一小撮阶级敌人。通过全厂广大革命群众的揭发批判，发现前一阶段刮起的无政府主义的妖风，原来来自厂内走资派。厂革委会抓住这个“活靶子”，对走资派和一小撮阶级敌人展开了批判斗争，提高了工人的阶级觉悟，全厂出现了一个自觉制订抓革命、促生产公约的热潮，进一步肃清了无政府主义的流毒。当社会上刮起一股右倾翻案妖风时，厂革命委员会又及时发动群众，认真学习毛主席一系列最新指示，各班组结合厂内具体情况，深入开展揭发批判活动。有个小组用大量事实揭发了厂里的走资派使用各种卑鄙手法，蒙蔽、拉拢和收买工人，进行翻案的反革命阴谋活动。工人们从活生生的事实中看到，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越是要作疯狂的挣扎，从而更加激发了各小组工人深入开展革命大批判的自觉性。
    抓巩固，不断向阶级敌人发动进攻
    革命的大批判，是不断向阶级敌人进攻，巩固新生的革命委员会的战斗武器。以班组为基点的革命大批判开展了一个时期后，有一部分同志认为大批判搞得差不多了。针对这种思想情况，厂革委会组织全厂革命职工反复学习毛主席“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的教导，并且召开批判斗争会，用活生生的阶级斗争现实教育广大革命职工，提高革命警惕性，提高阶级斗争观念。思想认识提高了，革命大批判又出现了新的局面。厂革委会又及时总结典型小组大学习、大批判的经验，召开经验交流会和现场交流会，相互介绍大批判经验，检查工作，互相学习，取长补短，推动大批判进一步深入开展。
    抓动态，给阶级敌人以猛烈回击
    抓动态，主要是抓广大革命职工的思想动态和阶级斗争的新动向。如过去一个时期，少数职工认为，无产阶级文化大革命已经两年了，党内走资派等一小撮阶级敌人想动也动不起来了。针对这种轻敌麻痹思想，厂革委会及时抓住阶级敌人疯狂向无产阶级革命派反攻倒算的事实，教育全厂广大革命职工，进一步发动他们大议厂、车间、班组的阶级斗争形势，大揭阶级斗争的种种表现。许多活生生的阶级斗争事实，使全厂革命职工进一步懂得，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命。在这一场伟大的革命斗争中，全厂革命职工运用毛泽东思想这个望远镜和显微镜，观察阶级斗争的新动向，一次又一次击溃了阶级敌人的反扑。
    狠抓阶级教育，推动革命大批判
    去年，这个厂部分职工受到社会上无政府主义思潮影响，一度出现学习放松和劳动纪律松懈的现象。针对这些情况，厂革委会反复向全厂职工宣传毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，同时从新旧社会对比和忆苦思甜着手，在班组范围内普遍地开展了“五查”活动——查对毛主席、对毛泽东思想是不是无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚；查对毛主席最新指示学习得怎么样，用得好不好；查活学活用“老三篇”怎么样；查是否积极投入革命的大批判；查对无产阶级文化大革命的认识和态度。通过忆苦思甜和“五查”，使大家进一步激发了对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的无产阶级感情，进一步加深了对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨，清除了无政府主义思潮的影响，更加明确了持久而深入地开展革命大批判的伟大意义，从而有力地推动了革命大批判的进一步深入开展。
    这个厂在开展班组大批判时，在方法上还做到了“三个结合”：一是口诛和笔伐相结合，会上动口，面对面地对阶级敌人进行揭发、批判、斗争，会后人人动笔，组织批判文章；二是大学习和大批判相结合，在斗争中广泛深入开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，大办毛泽东思想学习班；三是大批判和本单位斗、批、改相结合，在深入开展革命大批判的基础上，充分发动群众，进行斗、批、改。
