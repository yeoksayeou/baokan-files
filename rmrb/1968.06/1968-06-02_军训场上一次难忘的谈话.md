An Unforgettable Conversation on the Military Training Ground

	Class Leader of the Fifth Platoon, Five Good Soldiers, Wang Heyin

	In 1964, shortly after the old soldiers were demobilized, the higher-ups assigned me to be the class leader of the Fifth Platoon. At that time, I was thinking about how to improve the entire platoon, aiming to at least be second if not first. Just then, the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing's "mass military competition" evil wind was blowing stronger, causing me to lose my direction for a moment. I thought, since everywhere is holding competitions, as long as we push military training to the forefront, go out and perform, everyone will say the Fifth Platoon is excellent. Thus, I seized every spare moment to study tactics and practice techniques.

	One afternoon, I was organizing the entire platoon for a tactical drill. The comrades had a strong sense of the enemy situation, and their actions were realistic. They should have been praised, but I was thinking about the performance, aiming for a good show, and instead kept criticizing one comrade for not having neat movements and another for not giving clear commands. I was so anxious that I was sweating profusely.

	During the break, Comrade Men came up to me. He asked with concern, "Class Leader Wang, what's making you so anxious?" I said, "These simple movements, even with daily practice, are still not good. Being a class leader is really hard!" Comrade Men nodded thoughtfully, as if he had seen through my thoughts. He patted my shoulder, had me sit down, and started talking to me.

	"Class Leader, how do you manage the Fifth Platoon?" I didn't wait for him to sit down before asking the question. Comrade Men smiled and said, "I was just about to talk to you about this issue." Then he asked me how I planned to improve the Fifth Platoon. I shared some of my thoughts. After listening, he pointed out to me, "Little Wang, you've changed a bit. You talk about military training all day, but you're thinking about performances, focusing on appearances. If you continue like this, you'll lead the Fifth Platoon astray. Chairman Mao said, 'Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles.' You should strictly follow Chairman Mao's teachings."

	At this point, I still tried to defend myself, saying that focusing on military training was to implement the "Four Firsts." After hearing this, Comrade Men became very anxious and asked me if I had heard the story of Dong Cunrui. He then stood up, left hand gripping his holster, right hand raised, and mimicked Dong Cunrui holding a bundle of explosives. He said to me, "Dong Cunrui used his hand to hold the explosives to blow up the enemy's fortress. In the critical moment, he stood up for the revolution and sacrificed himself. This was not because he practiced this movement well, but because his ideology was strong, his political awareness was high, and he had a heart that was infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao." He repeatedly told me that military techniques are mastered by people, and to unleash the power of military techniques, to lead a platoon well, one must pay attention to ideological and political work, and should put more effort into practicing ideology and style. Finally, he repeatedly reminded me to seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant work, "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas."

	That evening, Comrade Men came to the Fifth Platoon again. He told everyone, "In the past, we won battles relying on people's political awareness. In the future, we will still win battles relying on people's political awareness. You must insist on the Four Firsts!"

	Comrade Men's words were like a cooling medicine, making my mind clear again. That night, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. I thought about Chairman Mao's great teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's important instructions. I recalled the issues that had occurred in the platoon over the past month and felt that I had been blown off course by the evil wind of mass military competitions.

	The next day, I discussed the platoon's issues with the party cell leader, checked the errors of the purely military viewpoint, and discussed how to strengthen "Daily Reading" and how to deeply carry out the "One Helps One, One Red Pair" activities. From then on, the political atmosphere in our platoon gradually thickened.

	It was like this that Comrade Men, with a high sense of political responsibility, helped me and the comrades adhere to Chairman Mao's military line, insisting on a path that emphasizes proletarian politics. Now, Comrade Men has sacrificed himself in the work of supporting the left, defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and protecting twenty-seven class brothers. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Comrade Men as an example, "always stand guard and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line," and fight for the defense of Chairman Mao, the defense of Mao Zedong Thought, and the defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life.

    军训场上一次难忘的谈话
    门合同志生前所在连班长、五好战士　王和银
    一九六四年，老战士复员不久，上级就叫我到五班当班长。那时，我心中盘算着，怎样把全班搞好，不争个第一，也得争个第二。就在这个时候，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿所刮起的“大比武”妖风越来越大，使我一时迷失了方向。我想，现在到处搞比武，只要把军事
  “突”上去，出去一表演，谁也会说五班呱呱叫。于是，我抓紧一切空隙时间，钻技术，练战术。
    一天下午，我正组织全班演习战术。同志们敌情观念强，动作逼真，本应该受到表扬，可是，我想的是表演，图的是好看，反而不断地批评这个同志动作不整齐，那个同志的口令不流利，自己也急得满头大汗。
    休息的时候，门指导员来到我跟前，他关切地问道：“五班长，什么事把你急成这个样？”我说：“这么简单几个动作，天天练也练不好，这个班长真难当！”门指导员若有所思地点了点头，他好象已经看透了我的心思，按住我的肩膀，叫我坐下，就和我谈起心来。
      “指导员，怎样才能当好班长，请你讲点经验吧！”我没等他坐稳，就抢先提出了问题。门指导员笑了笑说：“我正准备找你谈谈这个问题。”接着，他便问我怎样把五班搞好，我讲了自己的一些想法。他听了以后，一针见血地对我说：“小王呀，你现在有些变了，你成天嘴里讲的是军事，心里想的是表演，实际搞的是形式，这样继续下去，会把五班引到邪路上去。毛主席说过，‘掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。’你应该不折不扣地按照毛主席的教导去办事。”这时，我还申辩了几句，说抓军事是为了使“四个第一”落实。门指导员听到这话以后，便十分不安地问我听过董存瑞的故事没有？他又站起身来，左手握紧手枪套，右手上举，做了一个董存瑞手托炸药包的姿势，然后对我说：“董存瑞用手托住炸药包去炸敌人碉堡，在紧要关头挺身而出为革命献身，这并不是因为他平时这个动作练得好，而是他思想练得好，政治觉悟高，他有一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心。”他一再告诉我，军事技术是靠人去掌握的，要想发挥军事技术的威力，要想领导好一个班，就要重视思想政治工作，应该在练思想、练作风方面多下功夫。最后他反复叮咛我要认真学习毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作。
    晚上，门指导员又来到五班，他告诉大家：“过去打胜仗靠人的政治觉悟，今后打胜仗仍然要靠人的政治觉悟，你们千万要坚持四个第一呀！”
    门指导员的话，象一剂清凉药，使我头脑开始清醒了过来。这天晚上，我翻来复去睡不着，想到毛主席的伟大教导，想到林副主席的重要指示，我回忆了一个多月来班内发生的一些问题，感到自己被大比武的妖风刮转了向。
    第二天，我便找党小组长一起研究班内的问题，检查单纯军事观点的错误，讨论了怎样加强“天天读”，怎样深入开展“一帮一、一对红”活动等问题。从这以后，我们班政治空气逐渐浓厚了。
    就是这样，门合同志以高度的政治责任感，帮助我和同志们坚持毛主席的建军路线，坚持走突出无产阶级政治的路。现在，门合同志在支左工作中，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线，为保护二十七个阶级兄弟英勇献身了。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，以门合同志为榜样，“时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗”，为保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的革命路线战斗一生。
