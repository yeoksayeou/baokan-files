Thousands of students from the University of Auckland held a massive protest march on June 28 to denounce the New Zealand government's submission to U.S. imperialism's will, allowing the United States to establish a radio tracking station called "Omega" on New Zealand's territory. This station is intended to guide U.S. submarines equipped with Polaris missiles.

The protesting students carried numerous banners with slogans such as "No to U.S. war plots," "Fight against Johnson to the end," and "Oppose Omega, no to U.S. bases," all directed against U.S. imperialism.

In recent days, similar protests have taken place in Wellington, Christchurch, and many other cities across New Zealand, all opposing the establishment of a U.S. military base. Despite the New Zealand Prime Minister's recent attempts to downplay the military significance of the "Omega" tracking station and deceive the public, the revolutionary people of New Zealand are not fooled. The struggle against the establishment of a U.S. military base in New Zealand continues to flourish nationwide.

    新西兰各地连日爆发反美示威
    首都惠灵顿和其他城市群众奋起斗争，强烈反对建立美军基地
    新华社奥克兰二十八日电　新西兰奥克兰大学的三千多名学生二十八日举行了声势浩大的示威游行，抗议新西兰政府屈从美帝国主义的旨意，让美国在新西兰的领土上建立一座名叫“欧米加”的无线电跟踪站，以便为载有北极星导弹的美国潜水艇导航。
    示威的学生高举着许多标语牌，上面写着“不准美国搞战争阴谋”，“把反对约翰逊的斗争进行到底”，“反对欧米加，不要美国基地”等反对美帝国主义的口号。
    近几天来，在惠灵顿、克赖斯特彻奇以及新西兰的许多其他城市也纷纷举行示威，反对美帝国主义在新西兰建立军事基地。尽管新西兰总理最近竭力掩盖“欧米加”跟踪站的军事意义，妄图欺骗广大群众，但是新西兰的革命人民不听他那一套，反对在新西兰建立美军基地的斗争正在全国继续蓬勃开展。
