Where there is oppression, there is resistance. Since last June, when U.S. imperialism supported Israel in invading and occupying large tracts of Arab land, the Palestinian people have united in their hatred of the enemy and risen up to fight. They have launched increasingly fierce guerrilla activities in the Israeli-occupied areas, striking heavy blows against Israel, the tool of U.S. aggression, and bolstering the Arab people's confidence in their ability to fight and win. Many Palestinian guerrilla fighters emphasized in conversations with Xinhua News Agency reporters that it was Chairman Mao's brilliant discourse on armed struggle that inspired them to take up arms and launch and sustain armed struggle. They pointed out that Chairman Mao is the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, and Mao Zedong Thought is their beacon of light. Chairman Mao's wise judgment that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is an absolute truth.

Inspiration and Enlightment

A Palestinian guerrilla fighter recently recounted to a Xinhua News Agency reporter that after the Palestinian people's armed struggle in the areas then occupied by Israel suffered a setback in 1965, some people became pessimistic and despondent, emphasizing only the unfavorable natural and objective conditions for armed struggle. However, the broad masses of the Palestinian people did not agree with this defeatist viewpoint. Many Palestinian revolutionary people drew great inspiration and enlightenment from Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Protracted War," and decided to continue the armed struggle, actively preparing for its further development. Therefore, within three months of the Israeli invasion last June, the Palestinian guerrillas had ignited the flames of armed struggle on the West Bank of the Jordan River. Guerrilla activities flourished there, and the first guerrilla bases were established. The Palestinian guerrillas launched widespread attacks on the occupied areas, with the flames of armed struggle burning all the way to major cities like Jerusalem, making the enemy panic-stricken.

A Palestinian guerrilla fighter recently arrived from the Gaza Strip introduced the local armed struggle situation to the Xinhua News Agency reporter, saying that the Palestinian guerrillas in the Gaza Strip had once been surrounded by the enemy and suffered losses, with some people becoming disheartened. Later, they studied Chairman Mao's quotations: "Struggle, failure, struggle again, failure again, struggle again, until victory—this is the logic of the people," and were greatly inspired. They regrouped their forces and continued the struggle. Now, they are actively operating in the Gaza Strip and have already expanded their activities to the Sinai Peninsula, repeatedly launching attacks on the Israeli invaders, inflicting heavy losses on them.

Another Palestinian guerrilla fighter said that recently, U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, has supported Israel in suppressing the activities of the Palestinian guerrillas on the occupied lands and continued military provocations against Arab countries; on the other hand, it has been plotting "peace talks" through the United Nations. The Soviet revisionist clique has connived at U.S. imperialism. However, as Chairman Mao said, "We must have a clear head, which includes not believing the 'sweet words' of imperialism and not being afraid of imperialist threats." We Palestinian people oppose the "political solution" trick and firmly advocate armed struggle, believing it to be the only path to liberation.

Determined, Fearless of Sacrifice

Many Palestinian guerrilla fighters have a deep affection for Chairman Mao. A Palestinian guerrilla fighter who recently participated in the armed struggle on the West Bank of the Jordan River, upon seeing the Xinhua News Agency reporter, excitedly shouted in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao!" to express his boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

Some Palestinian guerrilla fighters took the Little Red Book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Xinhua News Agency news bulletins printed with Chairman Mao's quotations into the Israeli-occupied areas, circulating them among their comrades.

Many Palestinian guerrilla fighters often study Chairman Mao's works, drawing strength from them and further displaying their courageous and tenacious fighting spirit. "Storm" commando member Abdul Raouf Umar is a prominent example. This heroic fighter had a Little Red Book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" during his lifetime. He particularly liked to recite the passage "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory," to encourage himself and his comrades. On March 21 this year, when the Israeli invaders launched a sudden attack on Karama on the east bank of the Jordan River, Umar used an anti-tank gun against the advancing enemy, destroying three tanks and armored vehicles. When his ammunition ran out, he tied some explosives to himself and charged towards an enemy tank, blowing it up and sacrificing himself heroically. Another member of the "Storm" commando, William Najib Nasser, was a platoon leader who often studied Chairman Mao's works. On the evening of March 4, during a four-hour battle near Ramallah on the West Bank of the Jordan River, he bravely fought against the Israeli occupying forces. After being seriously wounded in both legs and captured, he remained steadfast in the face of brutal torture and bribery, displaying great heroism.

The Power of Mao Zedong Thought is Boundless

Many Palestinian guerrilla fighters have read the Arabic version of Chairman Mao's military works. They also study a mimeographed booklet titled "The Experience of the Chinese Revolution" at their training bases. This booklet introduces many brilliant ideas from "Problems of Strategy in Guerrilla Warfare Against Japan" and other military works by Chairman Mao. They apply what they have learned to their guerrilla activities, achieving brilliant victories.

The brave fighting of the Palestinian guerrillas not only inflicted heavy losses on the Israeli invaders but also foiled the enemy's several attempts to encircle and annihilate them. The Battle of Karama is a vivid example. On March 21 this year, the Israeli invaders mobilized 15,000 troops, with the cover of fighter jets, tanks, and artillery, launching a fierce attack on the Karama Palestinian refugee camp on the east bank of the Jordan River. However, the Palestinian guerrillas, using Chairman Mao's guerrilla warfare strategies and tactics, cooperated with Jordanian patriotic soldiers and successfully repelled the attack. Before the Israeli invaders' attack, they ambushed the gathering Israeli troops, wounding Israeli Defense Minister Dayan; and during the battle, they conducted large-scale guerrilla activities in the Israeli rear to tie down the enemy's forces. In this battle, they used trench warfare tactics. The fact that there are trenches in Karama greatly shocked the Israeli invaders' command. After the Israeli invaders were forced to retreat, the guerrillas conducted multiple ambushes on the enemy's retreat route, inflicting heavy losses on the Israeli invaders. This victory greatly dampened the morale of the Israeli invaders and boosted the spirits of the Arab people.

After studying Chairman Mao's works, many Palestinian guerrilla fighters drew immense strength from them, determined to continue their struggle until final victory. A Palestinian guerrilla commander said that many of them are studying the "Three Articles," which has strengthened their confidence in the struggle's victory. He said: "Our struggle is a long-term one, but we, and our descendants, will persist in the struggle like the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains. We will certainly smash the U.S.-Israeli aggressors, liberate our land, and achieve final victory."

The Palestinian guerrilla forces continue to grow stronger in combat. The image shows Palestinian guerrilla fighters engaged in live-fire training.

    指路的明灯　力量的源泉
    ——记巴勒斯坦游击队在战斗中学习运用毛泽东思想
    哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。自从去年六月美帝国主义支持以色列侵略和占领大片阿拉伯土地以来，巴勒斯坦人民同仇敌忾，奋起斗争，在以色列占领区内展开了一天比一天更猛烈的游击活动，给予美帝的侵略工具以色列以沉重的打击，同时增强了阿拉伯人民敢于斗争、敢于胜利的信念。许多巴勒斯坦游击队员在同新华社记者谈话时都强调，正是毛主席关于武装斗争的光辉论述激励他们纷纷拿起武器，开展和坚持了武装斗争。他们指出，毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大导师，毛泽东思想是他们的指路明灯。毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的英明论断，是千真万确的真理。
    鼓舞和启示
    一位巴勒斯坦游击队员最近同新华社记者谈话时追述说，自一九六五年巴勒斯坦人民在以色列当时占领的巴勒斯坦地区内进行的武装斗争暂时遭到挫折后，有些人曾产生悲观失望情绪，片面强调自然客观条件不利于开展武装斗争。但是广大的巴勒斯坦人民不同意这种失败主义的观点。不少巴勒斯坦革命人民从毛主席的《论持久战》这部光辉的著作中得到很大的鼓舞和启示，决心继续进行武装斗争，并为进一步发展武装斗争作了积极准备。因此，在去年六月遭到以色列侵略后不到三个月的时间里，巴勒斯坦游击队就在约旦河西岸燃起了武装斗争的烈火。游击队的活动在那里蓬勃展开，第一批游击队基地建立起来了。巴勒斯坦游击队对以色列占领区进行广泛出击，武装斗争的烈火一直烧到耶路撒冷等大城市，使敌人惊惶不安。
    最近从加沙地带来的一位巴勒斯坦游击队员向新华社记者介绍当地武装斗争情况时说，加沙地带的巴勒斯坦游击队员曾经有一次被敌人包围，受到了损失，有些人产生了失望情绪。后来他们学习了毛主席的语录：“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑”，受到了很大鼓舞。他们重新集结了力量，继续开展斗争。现在，他们正在加沙地带加紧活动，并已经把他们的活动范围扩展到西奈半岛，不断对以色列侵略者发动袭击，使侵略者遭受重大损失。
    另一位巴勒斯坦游击队员说，最近，美帝国主义一方面支持以色列镇压巴勒斯坦游击队在被占领土地上的活动，并继续对阿拉伯国家进行军事挑衅；另一方面，它又通过联合国搞“和谈”阴谋。苏修叛徒集团纵容美帝国主义。但是，毛主席说得好：“我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”我们巴勒斯坦人民反对“政治解决”的骗局，坚决主张开展武装斗争，并认为这是取得解放的唯一道路。
    下定决心，不怕牺牲
    许多巴勒斯坦游击队员非常热爱毛主席。一位最近曾在约旦河西岸参加武装斗争的巴勒斯坦游击队员在见到新华社记者时，激动地用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”来表达他对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。
    有些巴勒斯坦游击队员把红色宝书《毛主席语录》和印有毛主席语录的新华社新闻稿带到以色列占领区内，在他们的战友中间传阅。
    许多巴勒斯坦游击队员经常学习毛主席著作，从中汲取力量，更加发挥了勇敢顽强的战斗精神。“暴风”突击队队员阿卜杜勒·拉乌夫·乌马尔就是其中突出的一个。这位英勇的战士生前有一本红色宝书《毛主席语录》。他特别喜欢朗读其中“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”这一段语录，来鼓励自己和他的战友。今年三月二十一日，当以色列侵略军对约旦河东岸的卡拉马发起突然袭击时，乌马尔用反坦克炮对付来犯的敌人，击毁了三辆坦克和装甲车。当他的炮弹用完时，他就把一些炸药缚在自己身上，向一辆敌人的坦克冲去，结果炸毁了敌人的坦克，自己也壮烈牺牲了。“暴风”突击队的另一名队员威廉·纳吉卜·纳赛尔，是一个分队的分队长，他经常学习毛主席著作。他于三月四日晚间在约旦河西岸拉马拉附近发生的一场历时四小时的战斗中，英勇地同以色列占领军进行战斗，在他双腿受重伤后被俘。他在残酷的拷打和收买诱骗面前坚贞不屈，表现了大无畏的英雄气概。
    毛泽东思想威力无穷
    许多巴勒斯坦游击队员阅读过阿拉伯文版的毛主席的军事著作。他们在训练基地还学习一本油印的名叫《中国革命的经验》的小册子。这本小册子介绍了《抗日游击战争的战略问题》和毛主席的其他军事著作中的许多光辉思想。他们把自己所学到的东西运用在游击活动中，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    巴勒斯坦游击队的英勇战斗不仅使以色列侵略军遭到了重大损失，而且粉碎了敌人几次想包围并歼灭他们的阴谋。卡拉马战役，就是一个生动的事例。以色列侵略军曾在今年三月二十一日出动一万五千人，在战斗机、坦克和大炮的掩护下，对约旦河东岸的卡拉马巴勒斯坦难民营发动了一次猛烈的进攻。但是，巴勒斯坦游击队运用毛主席的游击战争的战略战术，同约旦爱国士兵合作，终于打退了这次进攻。在以色列侵略军进攻前夕，他们伏击了集结的以色列军，打伤了以色列国防部长达扬；而在战斗中，他们在以色列后方进行大规模的游击活动，以牵制敌人的力量。在这次战役中，他们曾采用了地道战术。在卡拉马有地道，这一事实使以色列侵略军指挥部感到极大的震惊。在以色列侵略军被迫撤退以后，游击队又在敌人后退的路上进行多次伏击，使以色列侵略军遭受重大的损失。这次胜利大灭了以色列侵略军的威风，大长了阿拉伯人民的志气。
    许多巴勒斯坦游击队员在学习毛主席著作后，从中得到巨大的力量，决心把他们的斗争坚持下去，直到取得最后胜利。一位巴勒斯坦游击队队长说，他们许多人正在学习“老三篇”，增强了他们对斗争胜利的信心。他说：“我们的斗争是长期的，但是，我们、我们的子子孙孙将象愚公一样坚持斗争，我们定将粉碎美以侵略者，解放我们的国土和取得最后胜利。”
