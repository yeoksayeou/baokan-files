The radiant sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the land of Heilongjiang. Revolutionary committees have been universally established at all levels in Heilongjiang Province. Revolutionary committees are fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and the revolutionary and production situations are excellent and getting better and better.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Harbin on the 21st, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Heilongjiang Province, located at the forefront of anti-revisionism in the northeast of our country, have been universally established, achieving a red tide throughout the province. The revolutionary committees at all levels are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and leading the broad revolutionary masses to advance courageously along the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. This makes the newly born revolutionary committees increasingly healthy and strong in the storm of class struggle, fully displaying their tremendous power.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In places and units where power needs to be seized, the policy of revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. The name of this power organ is called the Revolutionary Committee." Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary masses in Heilongjiang Province have achieved victory in the struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Currently, all six districts, eleven cities, and sixty-five counties in the province have established revolutionary committees. In grassroots units, almost all rural people's communes and the vast majority of factories, mines, enterprises, shops, schools, and offices have established revolutionary three-in-one combination power organs. Revolutionary committees at all levels, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, have overcome interference from the right and the ultra-left, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. The revolutionary and production situations are excellent and getting better and better. Revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination are further consolidated and developed, revolutionary great criticism is deepened, and industrial and agricultural production is thriving.

"Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Revolutionary committees at all levels in Heilongjiang Province have deeply realized through practical struggle that adhering to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and emphasizing proletarian politics is the source of all our victories. Revolutionary committees at all levels regard learning, executing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought as the most fundamental task and the most sacred duty. Members of revolutionary committees at all levels, with profound proletarian feelings of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, lead the broad masses to actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, they immediately organize study and resolutely implement them. Under the leadership of revolutionary committees at all levels, the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the province is surging higher and higher, continuously creating new high tides. The radiant sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the land of Heilongjiang Province.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the condition of socialism. It is the continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Revolutionary committees at all levels in Heilongjiang Province have held meetings many times and gone deep into the grassroots, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the masses, analyzing and researching the new situations, new characteristics, and new trends of class struggle. They have clearly realized that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to its comprehensive victory, the more complex and profound the class struggle becomes. They must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," actively launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, continuously develop the good situation, and consolidate and develop the victories already achieved. The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary masses are displaying the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, resolutely opposing right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smashing the rightist reversal wind, and continuously launching criticism and struggle against China's Khrushchev and a handful of the biggest capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in Northeast China and Heilongjiang Province. The revolutionary great criticism in the province is further broadened and deepened. Leading members of revolutionary committees at all levels actively participate in the revolutionary great criticism battle and command this battle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The basic experience of revolutionary committees has three points: one is the representative of revolutionary cadres, one is the representative of the military, and one is the representative of revolutionary masses, realizing the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline administration, and organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses." Chairman Mao's instructions point out the fundamental direction for the construction of revolutionary committees. Members of revolutionary committees at all levels in Heilongjiang Province, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, go deep into the grassroots and among the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, accept the supervision of the masses, and strive to revolutionize the leadership cadre. The standing committee members of the Yichun City Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental point is to connect with the masses," carry Mao's revolutionary treasure book with them, long-term root themselves among the masses, learn from the masses, and do revolution with the masses, promoting all work and effectively promoting their worldview reform. The Zhaozhou County Revolutionary Committee has established the struggle against selfishness as a regular institution for office work, holding it regularly, accepting the opinions of the masses, and promoting the members of the revolutionary committee to adhere to the mass line and wholeheartedly serve the people. Many places' revolutionary committees pay great attention to respecting the pioneering spirit of the masses and fully playing the role of revolutionary mass organizations in their work. Members of revolutionary committees at all levels are determined to learn from comrade Meng Hetong, who is loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to "be the people's ox for life, pull the revolutionary cart for life," and strive to build the revolutionary committee into a battle command department that emphasizes proletarian politics, is full of revolutionary vigor, is decisive and powerful.

    毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光普照黑龙江大地
    黑龙江省各级革委会普遍建立
    革命委员会全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，革命和生产形势大好，越来越好
    据新华社哈尔滨二十一日电　地处祖国东北反修前哨的黑龙江省，各级革命委员会已经普遍建立，实现了全省一片红。各级革命委员会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地领导广大革命群众沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进，使新生的革命委员会在阶级斗争的风浪中不断健全和巩固，充分发挥出强大的威力。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。”黑龙江省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，取得了向党内一小撮走资派夺权斗争的胜利。目前，全省六个专区、十一个市和六十五个县，已全部建立了革命委员会。在基层单位中，几乎所有的农村人民公社和绝大部分工矿、企业、商店、学校、机关都建立了革命三结合的权力机构。各级革命委员会在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，排除来自右的和极“左”方面的干扰，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，革命和生产形势大好，越来越好。全省革命大联合和革命三结合更加巩固和发展，革命大批判进一步深入，工农业生产蒸蒸日上。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”黑龙江省各级革命委员会从斗争实践中深刻地认识到，坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，坚持突出无产阶级政治，是我们一切胜利的源泉。各级革命委员会都把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想作为最根本的任务，最神圣的职责。各级革命委员会成员怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，带领广大群众活学活用毛泽东思想。每当毛主席的最新指示下达时，他们立即组织学习，坚决贯彻执行。在各级革命委员会的带领下，全省活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，一浪高过一浪，不断出现新的高潮。毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光普照着黑龙江省大地。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”黑龙江省各级革命委员会曾多次召开会议并深入基层，同群众一起，认真学习毛主席的最新指示，分析研究了阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向。他们清醒地认识到：无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是复杂，越是深刻。一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，主动地向一小撮阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻，不断发展大好形势，巩固和发展已经取得的胜利。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，发扬无产阶级的坚决彻底革命精神，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，连续向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在东北地区和黑龙江省的代理人，展开批判和斗争，全省革命大批判更广泛深入地向前发展。各级革命委员会领导成员积极参加革命大批判的战斗，指挥这一战斗。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”毛主席的指示，为革命委员会的建设指出了根本方向。黑龙江省各级革命委员会成员遵照毛主席的伟大教导，深入基层，深入群众，倾听群众的意见，接受群众的监督，努力实现领导班子的革命化。伊春市革命委员会的常委们，遵循毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，身带毛主席的革命宝书，长期扎根于群众之中，向群众学习，同群众一道干革命，既推动了各项工作，又有力地促进了自己世界观的改造。肇州县革命委员会把斗私会定为机关工作的一项制度，按期召开，接受群众意见，促进革委会成员坚持群众路线，全心全意地为人民服务。许多地方的革命委员会在工作中十分注意尊重群众的首创精神，充分发挥革命群众组织的作用。各级革命委员会的成员，决心向无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部门合同志学习，“当一辈子人民的牛，拉一辈子革命的车”，为把革委会建设成为突出无产阶级政治、充满革命干劲、雷厉风行、精悍有力的战斗指挥部而奋斗。
