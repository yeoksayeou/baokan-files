In the year since U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel launched an aggression war against the Arab countries, leaders of various Palestinian mass organizations have strongly condemned U.S. imperialism as their number one enemy and expressed their determination to persist in armed struggle until the occupied Palestinian territories are liberated.

The General Secretary of the Palestinian Trade Union Federation, Husni Kufash, told Xinhua's correspondent in Cairo: "Twenty years ago, U.S. imperialism created the so-called Israel in our homeland of Palestine. Last June 5, U.S. imperialism instigated its tool of aggression, Israel, to launch a large-scale invasion against the Arab countries. History has proven that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the Arab people. To liberate our occupied homeland, we must resolutely fight against U.S. imperialism."

Husni said that the U.S.-Israeli aggression last June gave us another lesson. Now, more and more Palestinian people realize that armed struggle is the only way to defeat the enemy and liberate our homeland. Since the June 5 war, Palestinian guerrillas have intensified their battles on the occupied lands. He said: "We Palestinian workers, with all our manpower, financial resources, and other means, resolutely support our guerrillas. The final victory will surely be ours." Husni also expressed his gratitude for the firm support of the Chinese people and workers for the just struggle of the Palestinian people. He said: "The great people and workers of China, led by Chairman Mao Zedong, are our true friends."

The Chairman of the Palestinian Students Union, Muhammad Subah, told Xinhua's correspondent in Cairo: "Because Israel has the full support of U.S. imperialism, the Arab people suffered a setback in the June 5 war last year. However, this war greatly raised the awareness of the Arab people. The current activities of the Palestinian guerrillas throughout the Israeli-occupied areas show that the Palestinian people are determined to take control of their own destiny."

Muhammad condemned the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices to supposedly peacefully resolve the Middle East problem. He said: "The days when a few big countries decide the fate of small countries are gone. We do not believe in U.S. imperialism, and we have no illusions about the United Nations, which is completely controlled by the United States." He said that the only path to liberation for Palestine is to wage a people's war. He pointed out: "As long as the Palestinian people are well mobilized, organized, and armed, we believe that no matter how strong the enemy appears, we can defeat it. The heroic Vietnamese people are our example."

The Secretary-General of the Palestinian Writers Union, Halil Hamad, told Xinhua's correspondent in Cairo that the war launched by Israel on June 5 last year was planned and supported by U.S. imperialism, aiming to expand in this region. In fact, Israel is merely a base for protecting U.S. interests in this region and a tool for U.S. imperialism to infiltrate Asian and African countries and implement neo-colonialist rule. Therefore, our enemy is not just Israel, but mainly U.S. imperialism.

Hamad said that after the June war last year, the U.S. has been trying to force Arab countries to accept a so-called political solution to erase the Palestinian issue. However, the Palestinian people have given a powerful response with their armed struggle. He said: "The Palestinian people will not accept any solution that keeps Palestine under the rule of imperialism and Zionism. No matter what sacrifices we make, we will carry out our armed struggle to the final victory."

The Chairwoman of the Palestinian Women's Union, Samira Abu Ghazala, told Xinhua's correspondent in Cairo that armed struggle is the only path to victory. The Palestinian people have taken up arms to fight for their legitimate rights. She said that Israel can use Nazi methods to suppress the Palestinian people, but this will absolutely not stop the Palestinian revolution. The Palestinian guerrillas have given heavy blows to the Israeli invading army in the occupied Palestinian territories, vividly proving that the heroic Palestinian people can defeat Israel, which is armed with imperialist planes and tanks.

She said that the Chinese revolution, led by Chairman Mao Zedong, has demonstrated the power of the masses; as long as the people of various sectors in Palestine rely on their own strength, they can overthrow the rule of imperialism and Israel over Palestine.

She said that now many Palestinian women have joined the guerrilla war. They are as brave as men in fighting the enemy. The Palestinian Women's Union has mobilized all its possible and potential resources to support this armed struggle.

The Head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Khartoum, Said Sabr, told Xinhua's correspondent in Khartoum that Israel is a tool of U.S. imperialist aggression and a dagger stuck in the back of the Arab people. The U.S. has committed heinous crimes against the Arab people and is the number one enemy of the Arab people.

He said that the Palestinian issue is not just a Palestinian issue; the struggle of the Palestinian people is a part of the world revolutionary struggle of the people against U.S.-led imperialism and its lackeys. Therefore, the Palestinian people have the sympathy and support of the people of the world. He said that the banner of China's support for the world revolutionary people is clear. He expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for their support.

    巴勒斯坦各群众组织负责人指出美帝是阿拉伯人民的头号敌人
    决心坚持武装斗争直到巴勒斯坦获得解放
    只要巴勒斯坦人民动员起来、组织起来和武装起来就能打败美帝和以色列
    新华社五日讯　在美帝国主义及其走狗以色列对阿拉伯国家发动侵略战争一周年的时候，巴勒斯坦各群众组织负责人纷纷发表谈话，强烈谴责美帝国主义是他们的头号敌人，并表示决心坚持武装斗争，直到被占领的巴勒斯坦获得解放。
    巴勒斯坦工会联合会总书记胡斯尼·库法什在开罗对新华社记者说：“二十年前，美帝国主义在我们的祖国巴勒斯坦制造了一个所谓以色列。去年六月五日，美帝国主义又唆使它的侵略工具以色列对阿拉伯国家发动了大规模的侵略。历史证明，美帝国主义是我们阿拉伯人民的头号敌人。为了解放我们的被占领的家园，我们必须同美帝国主义作坚决斗争。”
    胡斯尼说，去年六月的美以侵略给了我们又一个教训。现在越来越多的巴勒斯坦人民认识到，武装斗争是我们打败敌人，解放自己的家园的唯一道路。六月五日战争以来，巴勒斯坦游击队在被占领的土地上加强了战斗。他说：“我们巴勒斯坦工人用我们全部人力、财力和所拥有的其他手段坚决支持我们的游击队。最后胜利一定属于我们。”胡斯尼还表示感谢中国人民和中国工人对巴勒斯坦人民正义斗争的坚决支持。他说：“毛泽东主席领导下的伟大的中国人民和中国工人是我们的真正的朋友。”
    巴勒斯坦学生联合会主席穆罕默德·苏巴赫在开罗对新华社记者说：“由于以色列得到美帝国主义的全力支持，我们阿拉伯人民在去年六月五日的战争中受到了挫折。但是，这场战争却大大地提高了阿拉伯人民的觉悟。目前遍及以色列占领区的巴勒斯坦游击队的活动表明，我们巴勒斯坦人民决心掌握我们自己的命运。”
    穆罕默德谴责美帝国主义及其帮凶策划的所谓和平解决中东问题的阴谋。他说：“几个大国决定小国命运的日子已经一去不复返了。我们不相信美帝国主义，我们对完全受美国控制的联合国也不抱任何幻想。”他说，巴勒斯坦通向解放的唯一道路，就是进行人民战争。他指出：“只要巴勒斯坦人民很好地动员起来、组织起来和武装起来，我们相信不管敌人看来多么强大，我们是能够打败它的。英雄的越南人民就是我们的榜样。”
    巴勒斯坦作家协会秘书长赫尔·哈马德在开罗对新华社记者说，以色列在去年六月五日所发动的战争是美帝国主义策划和支持的，目的是要在这个地区进行扩张。事实上，以色列只不过是保护美帝在这一地区的利益的基地，是美帝打入亚非国家，实行新殖民主义统治的工具。因此，我们的敌人不单是以色列，而主要是美帝国主义。
    哈马德说，去年六月战争以后，美帝竭力迫使阿拉伯国家接受所谓的政治解决，为的是要把巴勒斯坦问题一笔勾销。但是，我们巴勒斯坦人民以自己的武装斗争给予它以有力的回答。他说：“巴勒斯坦人民决不接受任何使巴勒斯坦继续处于帝国主义和犹太复国主义统治的解决办法。我们巴勒斯坦人不论付出多大牺牲，也要把我们的武装斗争进行到最后胜利。”
    巴勒斯坦妇女联合会主席萨米拉·阿布·格扎拉在开罗对新华社记者说，武装斗争是走向胜利的唯一道路。巴勒斯坦人民为了自己的正当权利，已经拿起武器投入战斗。她说，以色列可以使用纳粹手段镇压巴勒斯坦人民，但是这绝对阻挡不了巴勒斯坦的革命风暴。巴勒斯坦游击队在被占领的巴勒斯坦给以色列侵略军以沉重的打击，这生动地证明，英雄的巴勒斯坦人民可以打败用帝国主义的飞机和坦克武装起来的以色列。
    她说，在毛泽东主席领导下的中国革命显示出了人民群众的力量；巴勒斯坦各界人民只要依靠自己的力量，就能够摧毁帝国主义和以色列对巴勒斯坦的统治。
    她说，现在许多巴勒斯坦妇女参加了游击战争。她们象男人一样地勇敢杀敌。巴勒斯坦妇女联合会调动了它的全部可能和潜力来支持这一武装斗争。
    巴勒斯坦解放组织驻喀土穆办事处主任赛义德·赛勃尔在喀土穆对新华社记者发表谈话说，以色列是美帝国主义的侵略工具，是美帝国主义插在阿拉伯人民背上的一把匕首。美帝对阿拉伯人民犯下了滔天罪行，它是阿拉伯人民的头号敌人。
    他说，巴勒斯坦问题，不仅仅是巴勒斯坦人民的问题；巴勒斯坦人民的斗争是世界革命人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的世界革命斗争的一个组成部分。因此，巴勒斯坦人民得到全世界人民的同情和支持。他说，中国支持世界革命人民的旗帜是鲜明的。他表示巴勒斯坦人民十分感谢中国人民的支持。
