Some American friends recently wrote to relevant Chinese institutions, expressing their desire to study Mao Zedong Thought seriously in order to resolutely fight against the brutal rule of American imperialism.

An American worker wrote in a letter that he had read some Chinese publications and magazines and realized that "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for all workers in the world." This worker wrote that in the United States, the exploited working people can only fight against the exploiters using Mao Zedong Thought. The letter stated, "The fruits of labor originally belong to us, and they should be ours."

The worker also expressed the hope to obtain more Chinese publications, saying that in the United States, "many people are eager to know the true situation of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Another American from Los Angeles began his letter with a quote from Chairman Mao: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample down all enemies and never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person left, that person will continue to fight."

He wrote in the letter: "In Los Angeles, through studying the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' I have grasped Mao Zedong Thought, which has filled me with strength." He said, "No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, for the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, I will continue to fight."

This American wrote that to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, he had also given the "Little Red Book" to two black laborers. These two black workers were very happy upon receiving the book and expressed their determination to study it seriously.

    新华社讯　一些美国朋友最近在给中国有关机构的来信中，表示要通过认真学习毛泽东思想，来同美帝国主义的残暴统治进行坚决的斗争。
    一位美国工人在信中说，他曾读过中国的一些出版物和杂志，认识到：“毛泽东思想是全世界工人的指路明灯”。这位工人写道，在美国，被剥削的劳动人民，只有用毛泽东思想进行斗争，才能打倒剥削者。信中说，“劳动果实本来是我们的，它应该归于我们。”
    这位工人在信中表示希望得到更多的中国出版物，他说，在美国，“很多人都渴望知道关于中国文化大革命的真实情况”。
    另一位美国人从洛杉矶来信中一开头就引用了一段毛主席语录：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”
    他在信中写道：“在洛杉矶这个地方，我通过学习《毛主席语录》，掌握毛泽东思想，使我充满了力量。”他说，不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，为了毛泽东思想的胜利，我要继续战斗下去。
    这位美国人写道，为了宣传毛泽东思想，他还曾把《毛主席语录》送给两位黑人劳动者。这两位黑人在得到红色宝书后都十分高兴，表示要进行认真的学习。
