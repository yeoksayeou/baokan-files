In the midst of the triumphant songs of victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the medical and health departments at various levels in Jilin Province are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great instruction to "focus medical and health work on rural areas." Recently, they have organized a large number of rural medical teams to go to the front lines of rural production and serve the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

This batch of rural medical teams is composed of revolutionary medical and health workers from medical colleges and medical and health departments at the provincial, municipal, and county levels in Jilin Province, totaling more than 2,100 people. They are not only rural medical teams but also propaganda teams for Mao Zedong Thought. After entering the rural and remote areas, these white-clad warriors, on the one hand, study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and on the other hand, through a combination of fixed-point medical treatment and mobile medical treatment, prevent and treat diseases for the poor and lower-middle peasants, carry out mass health work and family planning work, and train health personnel for the countryside. At the same time, they actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in rural areas and, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, criticize the bourgeoisie and strive to reform their own thinking.

Since March of this year, under the inspiration of the great situation, the broad revolutionary medical personnel in Jilin Province have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and launched a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. With the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist personnel, medical and health departments at all levels in the province have set up more than 500 various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 30,000 medical personnel participating in the study.

In the study classes, the broad revolutionary medical personnel, armed with Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles," engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's series of great instructions on health work. This greatly aroused their profound proletarian feelings of love for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, raised their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and thus launched a vigorous movement to go to the countryside and serve the poor and lower-middle peasants.

In the study classes, they also used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out a mass revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pursued by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the medical and health departments. Many revolutionary medical and health workers listed a large number of facts to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the health department for their crimes of opposing Chairman Mao's great instructions on medical and health work. They are determined to follow the direction of medical and health work indicated by Chairman Mao, take the road of combining with the poor and lower-middle peasants, strive to reform their world outlook, and create new merits for the people.

    坚决贯彻执行毛主席的伟大指示
    把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去
    吉林两千多名卫生工作者奔赴农村为广大贫下中农服务
    新华社长春十六日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，吉林省各级医药卫生部门，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大指示，最近组织了大批农村卫生工作队，开赴农村生产第一线，为广大贫下中农服务。
    这批农村卫生工作队是由吉林省各医学院校及省、市、县医药卫生部门的革命医药卫生工作者组成的，共有二千一百多人。他们既是农村卫生工作队，又是毛泽东思想宣传队。这些白衣战士深入到农村和边远地区以后，一面学习、宣传毛泽东思想，落实毛主席的最新指示，一面通过定点医疗和巡回医疗相结合的形式，为贫下中农防治疾病，开展群众性的卫生工作和计划生育工作，为农村培训卫生人员。同时，他们还积极参加农村无产阶级文化大革命运动，和贫下中农一起，批判资产阶级，努力改造自己的思想。
    今年三月以来，吉林省广大革命的医务人员在大好形势的鼓舞下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，掀起了一个活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮。全省各级医药卫生部门，在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，办起了五百多个各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，有三万多名医务人员参加了学习。
    在学习班中，广大革命的医务人员，以毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”为武器，斗私批修，反复学习毛主席对卫生工作的一系列伟大指示，大大激发了对毛主席，对毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，从而出现了一个轰轰烈烈的到农村去，为贫下中农服务的群众运动。
    大家在学习班中，还以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在医疗卫生部门的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，展开了群众性的革命大批判。许多革命的医药卫生工作者，列举大量事实，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在卫生部门的代理人反对毛主席关于医疗卫生工作伟大指示的罪行。他们决心遵循毛主席指引的医疗卫生工作的方向前进，走与贫下中农相结合的道路，努力改造自己的世界观，为人民立新功。
