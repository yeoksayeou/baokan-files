We poor and lower-middle peasants have an unbreakable grudge with the landlords and rich peasants. Yet, the Chinese Khrushchev, this big bad guy, wants us to forget our blood debt with the class enemy. He advocates for "class cooperation," urging us to "forget our grudges" and "make mutual concessions" with the landlords and capitalists. What a despicable and treacherous heart he has! He is even more venomous than a poisonous snake.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "The Chinese proletariat suffers three kinds of oppression (imperialist oppression, bourgeois oppression, and feudal oppression), and the severity and cruelty of these oppressions are rarely seen in the history of other nations..." Chairman Mao's words hit the spot in our hearts. The hatred between us poor and lower-middle peasants and the landlords, rich peasants, bureaucrats, and capitalists runs deep. We hate them the most. In the old society, my family suffered for generations under the landlords, leading to separation of families, destruction of homes, and death. My father was tortured by the heartless landlord until he vomited blood and died in the landlord's mill. Then, the landlord's bloodthirsty mouth opened wide again. The landlord demanded debts, and my two sisters were sold for just two bushels of sorghum. This forced my mother, in the bitter cold of winter with snow falling, to lead my hungry and poorly clothed younger siblings and me away from home to beg for food. At that time, I was not yet ten years old and was forcibly taken by the heartless landlord to work for him. In less than two years, my younger brother and sister starved to death in the wilderness, and my two sisters were also tortured to death. Our family was thus destroyed by the landlord wolves, leaving only me alive. How can we forget this blood-stained class hatred? Not a chance! Not a million chances!

It is our great savior, Chairman Mao, who liberated us, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and saved me from the clutches of the landlord after more than twenty years of toil. Since then, we, the laboring people, have become the masters of the country and live a socialist life. The Chinese Khrushchev, this slave of the bourgeoisie, sees this and hates it. He tries to make us poor and lower-middle peasants forget our class suffering and cooperate with the wolves to "forget our grudges" and "make mutual concessions," attempting to dull our revolutionary spirit and let the class enemies seize power again, oppressing us poor and lower-middle peasants and continuing to eat human flesh and drink human blood.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of revolution." We poor and lower-middle peasants remember Chairman Mao's great teaching the most and understand it the deepest. Landlords and rich peasants are forever our enemies, and our struggle with them is unyielding. Our grudges with the landlords and capitalists are not just for our generation to forget but for all generations to come.

    永远记住咱贫下中农的血海深仇
    黑龙江省巴彦县永发公社红星大队老贫农  满青海
    我们贫下中农和地主富农结下的深仇大恨永远不能忘。中国赫鲁晓夫这个大坏蛋却硬让我们把同阶级敌人的血海深仇，扔在脑后，极力鼓吹“阶级合作”，拚命地要我们和地主、资本家“抛开仇怨”“互相让步”，好一副狗腿子嘴脸，叛徒心肠！真比毒蛇还毒。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“中国无产阶级身受三种压迫（帝国主义的压迫、资产阶级的压迫、封建势力的压迫），而这些压迫的严重性和残酷性，是世界各民族中少见的……”毛主席的话，字字句句都说到了我们贫下中农的心坎上。贫下中农和地主、富农、官僚、资本家的仇恨很深很深，对阶级敌人是最恨最恨。旧社会我家一连几辈子都是叫地主给害得妻离子散，家破人亡。父亲被狠心的地主折磨得吐血浆，活活地累死在地主的碾房里。接着，地主老财吃人不吐骨头的血口，又向我们张开来，地主逼债，两个姐姐被卖掉，只换了二斗高粱米，逼得妈妈在数九隆冬、大雪纷飞的日子里，领着腹中无食、衣不遮体的弟弟和妹妹，背井离乡去讨饭。当时我还不满十岁，也硬被狠心的地主抢去给他卖命，不到两年的工夫，弟弟、妹妹就先后饿死在荒郊野外，两个姐姐也被折磨死了。我们这个家，就这样被地主豺狼害得死的死、亡的亡，只剩下我一个。这血泪斑斑的阶级仇恨，我们怎么能够忘记！一千个不能！一万个不能！
    是我们劳动人民的大救星毛主席他老人家解放了我们广大贫下中农，把我这个给地主扛了二十多年活的穷光棍，从“虎口”里救了出来。从此我们劳动人民做了国家的主人，过上了社会主义生活。中国赫鲁晓夫这个资产阶级的奴才，却又看在眼里，恨在心上，左一个圈，右一个套地想叫我们贫下中农忘记阶级苦，跟豺狼“抛开仇怨”“互相让步”搞“阶级合作”，妄图麻痹我们的革命斗志，让阶级敌人再专我们的政，重新骑在我们贫下中农的头上，继续吃人肉，喝人血。
    毛主席教导说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”我们贫下中农对毛主席的这一伟大教导，记得最牢，理解得最深。地主富农永远是我们的仇敌，我们同他们的斗争，是一步也不能让的。我们和地主资本家的仇怨不光我们这代不能抛开，世世代代也不能抛开。
