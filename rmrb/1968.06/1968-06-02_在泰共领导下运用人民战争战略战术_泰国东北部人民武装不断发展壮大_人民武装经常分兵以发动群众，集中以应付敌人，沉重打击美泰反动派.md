Newspaper Report: "Voice of the Thai People" Radio Station Broadcasts an Article Celebrating the Development of the People's Armed Forces in Northeastern Thailand Under the Leadership of the Thai Communist Party, Heavily Striking the U.S.-Thai Reactionaries

	The article says, more than two years ago, under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, the Thai people in the northeastern region, in Nakhoon Phanom Province, Nakhon Phanon County, fired the first shot of the revolutionary armed struggle. The flames of revolution quickly spread to various regions across the country. Today, out of the 71 provinces nationwide, 30 provinces have already ignited the flames of revolutionary armed struggle.

	The article says, the people's armed forces in the northeast learn and apply Chairman Mao's strategy and tactics of people's war. They often divide their forces to mobilize the masses and concentrate their forces to deal with the enemy. Sometimes they form small teams to penetrate deep into the vast rural areas to organize and mobilize the masses, and sometimes they concentrate their forces to ambush and attack the enemy, appearing and disappearing suddenly, and moving flexibly. Therefore, although the people's armed forces are generally at a disadvantage, they can concentrate superior forces in each specific battle to gradually annihilate the temporarily powerful enemy, repeatedly foiling the enemy's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression," and continuously strengthening their own forces. Incomplete statistics show that over the past two years, the people's armed forces in the northeast have engaged in 490 battles with the enemy, annihilating more than 1,200 U.S.-Thai reactionary soldiers and police.

	The article says, the people's armed forces in the northeast follow the teachings of the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao: "The ultimate source of the great power of war lies in the masses." "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can war be waged, and only by relying on the masses can war be waged." The people's armed forces take mobilizing the peasant masses and waging revolutionary armed struggle in the countryside as their main task. Incomplete statistics show that over the past year, the people's armed forces in the northeast have dispatched "armed propaganda teams" to penetrate enemy-occupied villages 155 times, conducting propaganda, organizing, and arming the masses. They have punished a large number of notorious spies, special agents, and landlord tyrants, greatly encouraging the broad peasant masses and raising their class consciousness. The people's armed forces have gained strong support from the masses.

	The article says, the heroic people's armed forces in the northeast, who have a fish-water relationship with the masses and receive the full support of the revolutionary people across the country, are advancing amidst the sound of victory. Although there will still be serious difficulties and twists and turns on the revolutionary journey, under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, which holds high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the people's armed forces in the northeast, together with the revolutionary people across the country, will surely persist in people's war and defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique. The final victory will definitely belong to the Thai people who persist in revolutionary armed struggle.

    在泰共领导下运用人民战争战略战术
    泰国东北部人民武装不断发展壮大
    人民武装经常分兵以发动群众，集中以应付敌人，沉重打击美泰反动派
    新华社三十一日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台三十日广播一篇文章，热烈欢呼泰国共产党领导下的泰国东北部人民武装，不断发展壮大，沉重地打击了美泰反动派。
    文章说，两年多以前，泰国共产党领导泰国人民在东北部那空拍侬府那家县，打响了革命武装斗争的第一枪，革命的烈火迅速地蔓延到全国各地区。今天，全国七十一个府中，已经有三十个府燃起了革命武装斗争的烽火。
    文章说，东北部人民武装学习和运用毛主席关于人民战争的战略战术。他们经常分兵以发动群众，集中以应付敌人，时而组成小分队深入广大农村组织和发动群众，时而又集中兵力伏击和袭击敌人，神出鬼没，机动灵活。因此，在全体上还处于劣势的人民武装力量，能够在每次具体战斗中，集中优势兵力，一部分一部分地消灭在全体上暂时强大的敌人，一次又一次地粉碎了敌人的反革命“围剿”，不断壮大自己的力量。据不完全统计，两年多来，东北部人民武装同敌人战斗共四百九十次，歼灭美泰反动军警一千二百多人。
    文章说，东北部人民武装遵照世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席的教导：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”人民武装把发动农民群众，在农村开展革命武装斗争作为工作重心。据不完全统计，一年多来，东北部人民武装共派遣“武装宣传队”深入敌后村庄，进行宣传、组织、武装群众达一百五十五次，惩处了一大批罪大恶极的暗探、特务和地主恶霸，大大地鼓舞了广大农民群众，提高了群众的阶级觉悟。人民武装获得了群众的大力支持。
    文章说，同群众有着鱼水关系，得到全国革命人民全力支持的英勇的东北部人民武装，正在凯歌声中前进。在革命征途上，尽管还会碰到严重的困难和曲折，但是，在高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗的泰国共产党的领导下，东北部人民武装同全国革命人民一起坚持人民战争，就一定能够打败美帝国主义及其走狗他侬—巴博卖国集团。最后胜利一定属于坚持革命武装斗争的泰国人民。
