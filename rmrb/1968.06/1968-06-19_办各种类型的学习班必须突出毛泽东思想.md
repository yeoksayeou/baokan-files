Editor's Note: Conducting study classes is to arm cadres and the masses with the great Mao Zedong Thought, to promote the revolutionization of people's thinking. We must always remember this fundamental purpose at all times and in all circumstances.

In study classes, of course, we can solve some specific problems in work and production. However, if we do not first bring problems to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, but instead discuss specific issues and only solve specific problems, then we will definitely take the wrong path. The phenomenon pointed out in this reader's letter is quite noteworthy. Editor:

We must emphasize Mao Zedong Thought in conducting study classes. Some people might think that this is a redundant statement, that there can be no study classes without emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought. But there are! In our area, there is a production team that sometimes conducts study classes without emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought. For example, this production team lacks fertilizer, so a study class was held to solve the fertilizer problem. In the study class, instead of using Mao Zedong Thought to inspire the members to overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, the cadres issued orders, and the members reported quotas. As a result, the fertilizer problem was temporarily solved, but the ideological problem was not solved, and some members were not happy after contributing fertilizer.

The PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the commune and the commune's Revolutionary Committee discovered this situation and organized the team's cadres and members to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on "politics being the commander, the soul" and "political work being the lifeline of all economic work." This helped everyone realize that conducting study classes is to arm people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought. If study classes are merely seen as a measure to complete production tasks, then the fundamental purpose of conducting study classes is lost. After raising their awareness, they finally put the team's study classes back on the track of Mao Zedong Thought.

    办各种类型的学习班必须突出毛泽东思想
    编者按：办学习班就是要用伟大的毛泽东思想武装干部和群众的头脑，促进人的思想革命化。我们在任何时候和任何情况下，都要记住这一根本目的。
    在学习班里，当然可以解决一些工作中和生产中的具体问题，但是如果不首先带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，而是就事论事，只去解决具体问题，那就一定会走弯路。这封读者来信指出的现象，就很值得注意。编辑同志：
    我们办学习班，必须突出毛泽东思想。有人也许以为这话等于不说，那有办学习班而不突出毛泽东思想的呢？有！我们这里有个生产队，有时候办的学习班就没有突出毛泽东思想。比如这个生产队缺乏肥料，就为解决肥料办了学习班。在学习班里不是用毛泽东思想启发社员破私立公，而是干部发号召，社员报指标。结果肥料问题暂时解决了，思想问题却没有解决，有的社员投肥后心情并不舒畅。
    驻公社解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和公社革委会的同志，发现了这种情况，就组织这个队的干部和社员反复学习毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，使大家认识到办学习班就是要用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑，如果把学习班仅仅当作完成生产任务的措施，那就失去了大办学习班的根本目的。大家认识提高之后，才把本队的学习班重新引上了毛泽东思想的轨道。
