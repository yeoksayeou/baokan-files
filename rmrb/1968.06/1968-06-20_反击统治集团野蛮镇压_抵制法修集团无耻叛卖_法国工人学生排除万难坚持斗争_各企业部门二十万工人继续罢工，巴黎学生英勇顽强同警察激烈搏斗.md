French workers and students continue to thwart the counterrevolutionary tactics of forceful suppression and bribery by the French ruling clique, resolutely resisting the betrayal by the revisionist group, and unyieldingly persisting in their struggle. Currently, workers in the automobile manufacturing, metallurgy, and shipbuilding industries, as well as employees of the French National Radio and Television, are still on strike. Students in Paris are bravely resisting the savage suppression by the French ruling clique and are engaged in fierce battles with the police in the streets.

In this unprecedented wave of strikes by French workers, workers from automobile companies such as Citroën, Peugeot, and Berliet have bravely fought back against the capitalists and the revisionist group's collusion with the yellow unions to impose conditions for resuming work. They are in high spirits and steadfastly continuing their strike.

In addition to the automobile industry, many large enterprises in France, such as the Usinor steel plant in Dunkirk, the naval shipyard in Nantes, and the Thomson-Houston electronics factory, are still on strike. Workers at the Southern Aircraft Company factory near Marseille have gone on strike again after resuming work for a few days.

The strike by employees of the French National Radio and Television has entered its fifth week. Due to the strike, this important propaganda tool of the French ruling clique has been paralyzed for over a month.

According to statistics, at least 200,000 workers are still on strike in various industries in France.

According to estimates by Western newspapers and news agencies, the large-scale strike by French workers will reduce France's industrial output by at least 6% this year, resulting in a loss of approximately $410 million. In the automobile industry, where the strike has lasted the longest (over a month), French capitalists have lost at least 200,000 cars.

While French workers are steadfastly continuing their strike, students across France continue their class boycotts. On June 16th, the French ruling clique mobilized a large number of police to storm Paris University, carrying out naked armed suppression against the students who were persevering in their struggle. The police savagely threw tear gas and stun grenades at the students. The students fought back fiercely against the police, shouting slogans such as "Down with the police state!" and "Liberate Paris University!"

Later, the students defied the government's ban and held a rally on the streets surrounding Paris University to protest the government's brutal suppression. The students fought back against the police once again.

Near the Odéon Theatre in Paris, when the police attacked the students with tear gas and stun grenades in an attempt to disperse the demonstration, the students pushed over eight buses and built barricades in the middle of the road. They retaliated against the police with cobblestones and other objects. The battle lasted for a long time.

On Saint-Michel Boulevard in Paris, the students linked arms, sang the "Internationale," and shouted slogans to protest the police's provocations and to retaliate against them.

On the afternoon and evening of June 17th, thousands of students once again held demonstrations and rallies to protest the police entering Paris University and to retaliate against the police's provocations.

The police, who forcibly entered Paris University, were forced to retreat to the main building under the students' brave resistance. By June 18th, the medical school, science faculty, and literature faculty of Paris University were still under student control.

    法国工人学生排除万难坚持斗争
    各企业部门二十万工人继续罢工，巴黎学生英勇顽强同警察激烈搏斗
    新华社十九日讯　巴黎消息：法国进步的工人和学生继续挫败法国统治集团武力镇压和收买分化的反革命两手，坚决抵制法修集团的叛卖，不屈不挠地坚持斗争。目前，汽车制造、冶金、造船等工业部门的工人和法国国家广播电视台的职工仍在坚持罢工。巴黎的学生英勇反击法国统治集团的野蛮镇压，在街头同警察进行了激烈的搏斗。
    在这次空前猛烈的法国工人罢工浪潮中英勇斗争的雪铁龙、普吉奥、贝利埃等汽车公司所属工厂的工人，已经多次顶回了资本家和法修集团、黄色工会合谋炮制的复工条件，斗志昂扬，顽强地坚持罢工。
    除汽车工业外，法国还有许多大企业，例如敦克尔克的尤西诺钢铁厂、南特的海军造船厂、汤姆森—霍斯敦电子器材厂等工厂的工人仍在罢工。马赛附近的南方飞机公司的工厂的工人，在复工几天后再次罢工。
    法国国家广播电视台职工的罢工已经进入第五周。由于罢工，法国统治集团的这个重要宣传工具一个多月来一直处于瘫痪状态。
    据统计，法国各企业部门目前仍在坚持罢工的工人，至少还有二十万人。
    据西方报纸和通讯社估计，到目前为止，法国工人的大罢工将使今年法国工业产值至少减少百分之六，损失约四十一亿美元。在坚持罢工时间最长（一个多月）的汽车工业中，法国资本家至少损失了二十万辆汽车。
    在法国工人顽强坚持罢工的同时，法国各地的大学生继续进行罢课斗争。十六日，法国统治集团调动大批警察冲进巴黎大学，对坚持斗争的学生进行赤裸裸的武装镇压。警察野蛮地向学生投掷催泪弹和震荡手榴弹。学生们同警察进行了激烈的搏斗，他们愤怒地高呼“打倒警察国家！”“解放巴黎大学！”等口号。
    学生们后来又不顾法国统治集团的禁令，在巴黎大学周围的大街上举行集会，抗议政府的野蛮镇压。学生们同警察再次进行了激烈的搏斗。
    在巴黎奥代翁剧院附近，当警察用催泪弹和震荡手榴弹袭击学生，企图把示威队伍驱散时，学生们推倒八辆公共汽车，在马路中心筑起街垒，用铺路石子和其他物件，向警察反击。战斗持续了很长时间。
    在巴黎圣米歇尔大街，学生们手拉着手，高唱《国际歌》，高呼口号，抗议警察的挑衅，并且给警察以反击。
    十七日下午和晚上，数以千计的学生再次举行示威和集会抗议警察进入巴黎大学，并且反击警察的挑衅。
    强行进入巴黎大学后的警察，在学生们的英勇反击下，只得龟缩在校本部内，到十八日为止，巴黎大学的医学院、理学院、文学院等，仍在学生占领下。
