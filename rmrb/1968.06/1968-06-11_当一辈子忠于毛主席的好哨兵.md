Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao!

The sentries at the frontier resolutely carry out your approved orders.
We will learn from Comrade Men He, and be lifelong loyal sentries to you!
We will defend the coastal frontier for you all our lives!
We will fight to defend your revolutionary line while alive, and sacrifice ourselves to defend your revolutionary line while dead!

In a small sentry post at the southernmost tip of Hainan Island, the soldiers stand in formation before the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, loudly reciting their oaths.

This is an unforgettable day for the sentry post. The soldiers are vigilantly monitoring the movements of the American aggressors on the opposite shore of Vietnam, when the telephone rings, bringing the joyous news that the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin have personally approved the posthumous awarding of the honorable title to Comrade Men He. The soldiers cannot help but shed tears of joy. Every word before them gives them boundless inspiration, and every sentence gives them great education. The towering image of a great soldier who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao stands before them. The soldiers eagerly share this news with their comrades on duty and with every household in the nearby fishing villages using the fastest means possible.

For more than a decade, the soldiers of this sentry post have vigilantly guarded their posts, earning many merits for the people. They often say, "We stand guard for Chairman Mao. All our strength comes from Chairman Mao, and all victories belong to the great leader Chairman Mao!" Today, they hear Comrade Men He's heroic words, "Always stand guard and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line," and feel especially close to them. They say, the enemies at home and abroad fear most the soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, like Comrade Men He. We must learn from Comrade Men He, follow the hero's thoughts, walk the hero's path, and be lifelong loyal sentries to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! The active learner of Chairman Mao's works from the Guangzhou Military Region, the sentry post commander Wang Juanzhang, writes in his notebook: "Standing by the South China Sea, my heart is connected to Beijing; loyal to Chairman Mao, forever a sentry." Each soldier engraves in their heart Comrade Men He's oath: "Always think of Chairman Mao, always follow Chairman Mao, always fight for Chairman Mao."

Learn from Men He, see the action. While learning from Comrade Men He's deeds, the soldiers of the sentry post launched activities to temper their infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao. That evening, the sentry post held a criticism meeting. With infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they fiercely criticized the anti-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan in coastal defense construction. The sentry post commander Wang Juanzhang firmly said, "We will defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line for life. Whoever opposes it, we will not agree. The revolutionary path guided by Chairman Mao, we will walk steadfastly. We will walk all the way to communist society."

In learning from Men He, this sentry post also joined with the nearby fishermen to launch the "one help one, one pair loyal" activity. The soldiers in the fishing villages, on the beaches, and on the boats, propagated Comrade Men He's deeds, and together with the fishermen, learned Comrade Men He's thorough revolutionary spirit, and carried out revolutionary criticism. Some fishermen felt that China's Khrushchev and his agents' anti-revolutionary revisionist line of "three independences and one contract," "contracting to the boat," and "distributing fish to the household" had been criticized enough. The soldiers then studied with them repeatedly Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, recalled bitterness and sweetness, and laid out the new situation and trends of class struggle. Many fishermen said: We must be like Comrade Men He, fight for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line all our lives, without stopping for a single moment! The revolutionary criticism quickly spread vigorously among the fishermen.

The people's soldiers at the South China Sea frontier, following the footsteps of the heroes, resolutely carry out and defend with their lives Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, determined to make greater contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    当一辈子忠于毛主席的好哨兵
    毛主席啊，毛主席！
    天涯哨兵坚决执行您批准的命令，
    我们要学习门合，当一辈子忠于您的好哨兵！
    一辈子为您固守海防！
    生为捍卫您的革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫您的革命路线而献身！
    在祖国海南岛最南端的一个小小哨所里，指战员们列队在伟大领袖毛主席像前，高声朗读着誓言。
    这是哨所战士难忘的一天。哨兵们正在和越南一海之隔的阵地上，警惕地监视着美国强盗的行踪，电话铃响了，传来了伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准追授门合同志光荣称号的特大喜讯。一个个战士禁不住泪花直涌，这眼前的每一个字都给他们无穷的鼓舞，每一句话都给他们极大的教育，一个无限忠于毛主席的伟大战士的高大形象，屹立在他们的面前。哨兵们争着用最快的方法，把这一喜讯传给值勤的战友，传给附近渔村的每一户渔民。
    十几年来，这个哨所的指战员们警惕地守卫在自己的岗位上，为人民立下了不少功勋。他们常说：“我们是为毛主席站岗放哨，我们的一切力量来自毛主席，一切胜利都属于伟大领袖毛主席！”今天，他们听到门合同志的豪言壮语，“时刻为毛主席革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗”，感到分外亲切。他们说，国内外一切敌人，最害怕的就是门合同志这样的无限忠于毛主席的战士。我们一定要以门合同志为榜样，学英雄思想，走英雄道路，当一辈子无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好哨兵！广州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、哨所所长王卷章在笔记本上写道：“站在南海滨，心连北京城；忠于毛主席，永做一哨兵。”一个个战士在心上铭记下门合同志的誓言：“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。”
    学门合，看行动。哨所的战士们，就在学习门合同志事迹的同时，展开了锤炼对毛主席的无限忠心的活动。这天晚上，哨所召开了批判会，他们以门合同志为榜样，怀着对毛主席革命路线的无限忠诚，狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿在海边防建设上推行的反革命修正主义路线。哨所所长王卷章坚定地说，我们要一辈子捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。那个要反对，我们坚决不答应。毛主席指引的革命路，我们走定了。我们要一直走到共产主义社会。
    在学门合中，这个哨所还和附近的渔民一道开展了“一帮一，一对忠”的活动。指战员们在渔村、海滩、船头上，宣传门合同志的事迹，同渔民们一起学习门合同志的彻底革命精神，一起开展革命的大批判。有些渔民觉得中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人“三自一包”、“包产到船”、“分鱼到户”的反革命修正主义路线已经批判得差不多了。指战员们就和他们一起反复学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导，一起忆苦思甜，大摆阶级斗争的新形势、新动向。许多渔民说：我们一定要象门合同志那样，一辈子为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而战斗，一分一秒也不能停息！革命的大批判，迅速在渔民中轰轰烈烈地开展起来。
    南海前哨的人民战士，踏着英雄的足迹，坚决执行、誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，决心为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利作出更大的贡献。
