In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers in many factories and enterprises in Wuhan have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's great directives of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "further save and make revolution," achieving abundant results in increased production and savings. Currently, in many factories and enterprises, the spirit of saving is glorious, and waste is shameful, becoming a prevalent trend.

Using the perspective of the struggle between the two lines to approach the work of saving is a prominent feature of the Wuhan working class in implementing Chairman Mao's teaching of "further save and make revolution." They elevate every economic task to the level of the struggle between the two lines, ensuring that the work of saving follows Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary workers of the Hanshan Rolling Mill, in order to save production coal, once adopted gas cooling measures to replace water cooling measures, which was an extremely effective comprehensive measure to save coal and water. However, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the factory, using the excuse of unresolved technical issues, suppressed this new thing. After the revolutionary committee was established, they summarized the opinions of the worker masses, believing that the adoption and suppression of the gas cooling measure reflected the struggle between the two lines. Whether to promote this technological innovation measure or suppress it was not a technical issue but a serious political struggle. In this struggle, the revolutionary committee led the revolutionary workers to repeatedly study and understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "further save and make revolution," and Chairman Mao's teachings: "The wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and intellectual laborers. As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they will not evade problems but will actively solve them, and any human difficulties can be overcome." They armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, linking the work of saving coal with defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They summarized the experiences and lessons of the previous operation of gas cooling, pooled their wisdom, and worked day and night, finally completing the entire gas cooling project and putting it into operation in a short time.

Linking increased production and savings with anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism promotes revolutionary workers to internalize Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts of "further save and make revolution," and implement them in action. This is another feature of the increased production and savings work in Wuhan factories and enterprises. The wooden boxes used for packaging soap in the Wuhan Chemical Factory consume a large amount of wood. Someone proposed recycling the packaging wooden boxes for reuse, but some comrades had ideological resistance. Later, they used Chairman Mao's teaching of "embezzlement and waste are grave crimes" to examine their own thoughts, realizing that not saving the wood that could and should be saved was a "crime." They further examined the lack of effort in saving, which was mainly due to a reliance on the state, a bourgeois "young master" attitude of not using one's brain or exerting effort. The attitudes and styles of saving and not saving reflect the struggle between the two lines. On this basis of understanding, they also calculated the economic accounts: if each packaging box is recycled and reused once, 8,000 cubic meters of wood can be saved for the state annually, which can meet the wood needs for constructing three Wuhan Chemical Factories. Thus, they signed contracts with various county and city commercial and transportation departments, requesting these departments to help them recycle, while their own factory is responsible for repairing and modifying, making full use of the packaging wooden boxes.

The third feature of Wuhan's increased production and savings work is: relying on the factory, taking the initiative, self-reliance, and overcoming difficulties one by one. The Wuhan Flow Meter Factory previously used copper materials to manufacture parts. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers, in combination with the actual situation of their factory, studied Chairman Mao's teachings of "further save and make revolution" and "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," realizing the significant political significance of saving copper materials for the state, and learned from other places to use plastic instead of copper to manufacture parts. However, using plastic instead of copper to manufacture parts requires a complete set of production technical equipment. This small factory with only over a hundred workers had just shifted from water and electricity installation to producing instruments two years ago, with no equipment and no manufacturing technology. In this situation, should they retreat and take the backward road, or should they advance bravely to strive for new victories? They studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Any new thing's growth is bound to go through twists and turns. In the socialist cause, to think that one can achieve success easily without going through twists and turns and without paying great efforts is just an illusion." They decided to take the spirit of "poor and blank making revolution," designing and manufacturing by themselves. They overcame numerous difficulties and finally successfully manufactured the required equipment, saving copper materials for the state.

    认真贯彻毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大方针
    武汉许多工厂企业取得增产节约丰硕成果
    据新华社武汉电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，武汉地区许多工厂企业的革命职工，认真贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大方针，取得了增产节约的丰硕成果。目前，在许多工厂企业中，节约光荣，浪费可耻，已蔚然成风。
    用两条路线斗争的观点对待节约工作，是武汉工人阶级执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”这一教导的一个显著特点。他们把每一项经济工作，都提高到两条路线斗争这个纲上来认识，使节约工作遵循着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线前进。汉阳轧钢厂的革命职工，为了节约生产用煤，曾采用汽化冷却措施代替水冷却措施，这是省煤省水极为有效的综合性措施。可是，厂内一小撮走资派却借口个别技术问题没有解决，扼杀了这一新生事物。厂革命委员会成立后，总结工人群众的意见，认为汽化冷却措施的采用和被扼杀，反映了两条路线的斗争。是把这项技术革新措施促上去，还是把它压下来，这决不是什么技术问题，而是一场严肃的政治斗争。在这场斗争中，革委会领导革命职工反复学习和领会毛主席的最新指示：“要进一步节约闹革命”，学习和领会毛主席的教导：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，把节煤工作与捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线联系起来。他们总结了以前汽化冷却运行的经验教训，群策群力，日夜奋斗，终于在很短的时间内完成了汽化冷却的全部工程，投入了运行。
    把增产节约同反修、防修紧密联系起来，促进革命职工把毛主席“要节约闹革命”的光辉思想，溶化到血液中，落实到行动上。这是武汉工厂企业增产节约工作的另一个特点。武汉化工厂包装肥皂用的木箱，耗用大量的木材，有人提出回收包装木箱加以利用，但一些同志对此有思想阻力。后来，他们用毛主席“贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪”的教导，对照检查自己的思想，认识到本来能够而且应该节约的木材不去节省下来，就是“犯罪”。并进一步检查了不努力节约，主要是有单纯依赖国家的思想，是一种不动脑筋、不费气力的资产阶级“大少爷”作风在作怪。节约不节约的两种态度、两种作风，是两条道路斗争的反映。在这个认识的基础上，他们又算了经济账：如果每个包装箱收回利用一次，一年就可为国家节约八千立方米的木材，这些节约下来的木材，可满足建造三座武汉化工厂对木材的需要。于是，他们同各县、市商业部门、运输部门签订合同，请这些部门帮助他们回收，自己厂负责修理、改制，使包装木箱得到了充分利用。
    武汉增产节约工作的第三个特点是：立足本厂，自己动手，自力更生，一个一个地克服困难。武汉流量仪表厂过去都是用铜材制造零部件。在无产阶级文化大革命中，职工们结合本厂实际情况，学习毛主席“要节约闹革命”和“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，认清了为国家节省铜材的重大政治意义，学习外地用塑料代铜材制造零部件。但是用塑料代铜材制造零部件，需要一整套生产技术装备。而这个只有一百多工人的小厂，又是在两年前由水电安装转为生产仪表的，既无设备又无制造技术。在这种情况下，是打退堂鼓，走回头路，还是知难而进，去争取新胜利？他们学习了毛主席“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想”的教导，决定以“穷棒子”闹革命的精神，自己动手设计，自己加工制造。他们克服重重困难，终于制造成功了所需要的设备，为国家节约了铜材。
