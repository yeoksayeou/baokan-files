Workers in major industrial sectors and docks continue their strikes, while students persist in occupying schools. Progressive students go to factory areas to form "Action Committees" with workers, fighting side by side. The French revisionist group spares no effort to sabotage the unity of workers and students, further exposing their counter-revolutionary faces.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 10th, Paris: The French workers and progressive students, with the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, continue to break through various obstacles and persist in their unyielding struggle. The French Communist Party's revisionist leadership is doing everything in its power to obstruct and sabotage the fighting unity of students and workers, attempting to extinguish the flames of the French people's struggle. This further exposes their ugly faces as lackeys of the French reactionaries.

On the 6th, the French government sent a large number of security forces to suppress the workers of Renault's Flins factory who were engaged in a sit-in strike, sparking a new wave of struggle among the French people. On the 7th, more than 5,000 workers from this factory and several hundred Paris students who came to support them fought bravely with the security forces from dawn to night.

On the same day, more than 20,000 Paris students held a demonstration in the French capital, protesting against the security forces' suppression of the strike and supporting the struggle of the Renault workers. They set out from the university area on the left bank of the Seine, divided into two groups and marched through the city, then gathered at the Saint-Lazare station in northwest Paris, preparing to take the train to Flins, 40 kilometers from Paris, to fight side by side with the Renault workers. In addition, more than 2,000 metallurgical workers walked from the western suburbs of Paris to the city center and demonstrated in front of the National Employers' Federation of the Metallurgical Industry, protesting against the government and capitalists' rejection of workers' reasonable demands and condemning the government's suppression of the Flins sit-in workers.

In the French National Radio and Television, which was recently occupied by a large number of police, the staff and reporters still insist on the strike. Many actors and artists in Paris, as well as news workers from many newspapers and news agencies in Paris, held demonstrations in front of the radio and television station on the 6th and 7th, supporting the striking staff. On the 9th, 3,500 students and teachers in Paris held a demonstration in front of the radio and television building to support the just struggle of the radio and television staff.

Currently, despite the French ruling class using both soft and hard tactics and various threats and inducements, and despite the French revisionist traitor group and various labor traitors trying to force workers back to work, the workers in France's main industrial sectors such as automobile manufacturing, aircraft manufacturing, metallurgy, chemicals, and construction, as well as docks and ports, are still insisting on the strike. Even in the postal, telegraph, and railway departments, where the French government and the yellow union leaders have propagated that work has resumed, many workers still do not listen to the government and the yellow union's orders and continue to fight.

French university and middle school teachers are also continuing their struggle. Some yellow union leaders in education, following the government's instructions, issued orders to stop the strike, which were condemned by the majority of teachers and many school-level "Action Committees." On the 8th, hundreds of Paris teachers rebelled, occupied their union headquarters, and established an "Occupation Committee," severely condemning the union leaders' treacherous behavior of sabotaging the teachers' just struggle.

French university students are still occupying more than ten universities across the country. On the 8th, student representatives from 15 French universities held a meeting in Strasbourg in eastern France, and representatives from the science university teachers and students also held a meeting in Clermont-Ferrand in central France to discuss current struggle issues. At the same time, large numbers of students left the campus and entered the factory areas, enthusiastically supporting the workers' just struggle and fighting side by side with the workers. Students in Paris, Lyon, Tours, Nancy, and Bordeaux, among other cities, have formed hundreds of "Action Committees" with workers to study and coordinate the struggles of workers and students. Paris students also took to the stages of more than ten theaters in Paris in the past two days to propagandize and mobilize, calling on the people to support the working class and "fight against the bourgeois order."

The French people's persistence in breaking through various obstacles and continuing their struggle has made the French ruling class even more anxious. French President Charles de Gaulle exclaimed in a television speech on the 7th: "The student movement is the 'spark' of this crisis in France. Due to its infectiousness, this (student) explosion has spread to some factories and 'the young people there.' This has caused France to suffer 'terrible shocks' and face the 'catastrophe' of a general strike." On one hand, he shouted anti-communism, and on the other hand, he promised to "reform" the universities and advocated labor-management "cooperation," attempting to quell the just struggles of workers and students.

The French Communist Party's revisionist leadership, on the other hand, spared no effort to serve the French reactionaries, obstructing and sabotaging the fighting unity of students and workers. The French General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the French revisionists, issued a statement on the 7th, attacking the Paris students who bravely rushed to Flins to fight side by side with the workers who were unjustly driven out of the factory by the security forces, cursing the students as acting on behalf of the "most vicious enemies." It also ordered the striking workers to obey only the orders of the General Confederation of Labor and not to heed the students' suggestions. At the same time, the French revisionists, through their pawns in the railway union, refused to dispatch trains to transport the tens of thousands of students and workers who had gathered at the Saint-Lazare station and were ready to go to Flins to support the Renault workers' struggle, allowing the French government to pick them off one by one and use violence to suppress the Flins workers. It can be seen that this group of French revisionist traitors, lackeys of the French reactionaries, has degenerated to such an extent.

Paris crowds hold high red flags and hold a grand demonstration, bravely persisting in their struggle.

    法国工人学生不屈不挠并肩坚持斗争
    主要工业部门和码头工人坚持罢工，学生继续占领学校
    进步学生到工厂区同工人组成“行动委员会”共同战斗
    法修集团不遗余力百般破坏工人学生的战斗团结，进一步暴露反革命嘴脸
    据新华社十日讯　巴黎消息：具有巴黎公社光荣革命传统的法国工人和进步学生，继续冲破层层障碍，不屈不挠地坚持斗争。法共修正主义领导集团竭尽全力，阻挠和破坏学生和工人的战斗团结，力图扑灭法国人民斗争的怒火。这进一步暴露了它充当法国反动派走狗的丑恶嘴脸。
    法国政府六日出动大批保安队镇压坚持占厂罢工斗争的雷诺汽车公司弗兰工厂工人的暴行，激起法国人民新的斗争浪潮。七日，这个工厂的五千多工人和几百名前去支援的巴黎学生，从清晨到深夜，同保安队进行了英勇搏斗。
    同一天，二万多巴黎学生在法国首都举行示威游行，抗议保安队镇压罢工的暴行，支持雷诺汽车工厂工人的斗争。他们从塞纳河左岸大学区出发，分两路穿过巴黎市区，然后集中到巴黎西北的圣拉扎尔车站，准备乘火车到离巴黎四十公里的弗兰去，同雷诺工人并肩战斗。此外，有二千多冶金工人从巴黎西郊走到市区，在冶金业全国雇主联合会前示威，抗议政府和资本家拒绝工人的合理要求，谴责政府镇压弗兰占厂工人的暴行。
    在法国政府前几天出动了大批警察强行占领的法国国家广播电视台，职工和记者们仍然坚持罢工。巴黎的许多演员和艺术工作者以及巴黎许多报刊、通讯社的新闻工作者，分别在六日和七日在广播电视台前游行，支持罢工的职工。巴黎的学生和教师三千五百多人，九日在广播电视大楼前举行示威，支援广播电视台职工的正义斗争。
    目前，尽管法国统治集团软硬兼施，使尽了各种威迫利诱的手段，尽管法修叛徒集团和形形色色的工贼极力欺压工人复工，法国的汽车制造、飞机制造、冶金、化学、建筑等主要工业部门，和码头、港口的工人仍然坚持罢工。就是在法国政府和黄色工会头目宣传已经复工的邮电、铁路等部门，还有不少工人不听政府和黄色工会的号令，继续坚持斗争。
    法国的大学和中学教师也在坚持斗争。一些黄色教育工会的头目按照政府的意旨，宣布停止罢教的命令，受到广大教师和许多学校基层的“行动委员会”的谴责。好几百巴黎教师八日奋起造反，占领了他们的工会的总部，成立了“占领委员会”，严正谴责工会头目破坏教师正义斗争的叛卖行为。
    法国的大学生目前仍在继续占领着法国全国的十多所大学。法国十五所大学的学生代表，八日在法国东部的斯特拉斯堡举行会议，法国理科大学的师生代表也在法国中部的克莱芒—费朗举行会议，研究当前的斗争问题。与此同时，大批学生走出校门，进入工厂区，热情支持工人的正义斗争，同工人并肩战斗。学生们在巴黎、里昂、图尔、南锡和波尔多等许多城市同工人联合组成了数以百计的“行动委员会”，研究和协调工人和学生的斗争。巴黎学生这两天还走上了巴黎十多个剧院的舞台，进行宣传鼓动，号召人民支持工人阶级，“同资产阶级的秩序作斗争”。
    法国人民冲破重重障碍，坚持斗争，使得法国统治集团更加惶惶不安。法国总统戴高乐七日在电视讲话中惊叹：学生运动是法国“这次危机”的“导火线”，“由于传染性，这种（学生中的）爆炸扩大到某些工厂”，和“那里的青年中”。这使得法国受到“可怕的震动”，面临总罢工的“灭顶之灾”。他一面叫嚣反共，另一方面答应“改革”大学，并鼓吹劳资“合作”，力图平息工人与学生的正义斗争。
    法共修正主义领导集团则不遗余力地为法国反动派效劳，极力阻挠和破坏学生和工人的战斗团结。法修控制的法国总工会七日发表声明，对不畏艰险，从巴黎赶到弗兰，同被保安队无理赶出工厂的工人并肩战斗的巴黎学生大肆攻击，咬牙切齿地咒骂学生是代表“最凶恶的敌人行事”。它还命令罢工工人只许服从总工会的号令，不要理会学生们的建议。同时，法修还通过它在铁路工会里的爪牙，拒绝派火车运送已集中到圣拉扎尔车站，要到弗兰去支持雷诺工人斗争的成千上万的学生和工人，好让法国政府各个击破，使用暴力把弗兰的工人镇压下去。由此可见，法修叛徒集团这批法国反动派的走狗，已经堕落到何等地步。（附图片）
