With the connivance and support of U.S. imperialism, the West German reactionary authorities, defying strong opposition both at home and abroad, brazenly pushed through the "Emergency Law" in the West German Federal Parliament on May 30. This law, aimed at strengthening fascist rule, once again shows that the West German ruling clique is determined to oppose the German people and to follow in the footsteps of Hitler's fascism.

The West German ruling clique, in its efforts to annex the German Democratic Republic and to restore the 1937 Nazi German borders, has been stepping up its nuclear armament and military buildup while at the same time strengthening its fascist rule at home.

For more than a decade, the West German government has been secretly working to create a "legal" basis for implementing fascist rule. In 1960, the West German cabinet secretly passed the "Emergency Law" draft. This draft stipulates that the West German Chancellor has the right to declare a state of "emergency" whenever he deems it necessary.

Under a state of "emergency," the West German government's powers would be virtually unlimited. It could arbitrarily mobilize the West German military and police, strip the people of their freedoms of speech, assembly, and movement, and impose military control over the economy and transportation. It could arbitrarily conscript people into the military, force them into labor, and seize private property, and it could issue various decrees with legal force.

Since 1960, the West German ruling clique has repeatedly submitted this fascist law to the parliament for discussion, but due to strong opposition from the West German people, it has not been successful.

Now, with class contradictions in West Germany further intensifying and the workers' and students' movements becoming more vibrant, the anxious West German monopoly bourgeoisie has once again brought out this fascist law. Taking advantage of the ruling party's majority in the parliament, they manipulated the voting machinery to hastily pass the law to meet their urgent need to suppress the people's revolutionary struggles.

It is reported that the West German authorities, fearing strong protests and demonstrations from the people, deployed more than 2,000 police officers outside the Federal Parliament during the final vote on the "Emergency Law," blocking all access points.

    西德议会悍然强行通过“紧急状态法”
    反动当局害怕人民抗议示威，表决时议会外密布警察
    新华社讯　波恩消息：在美帝国主义的纵容和支持下，西德反动当局不顾国内外人民的强烈反对，悍然于五月三十日在西德联邦议会强行通过了目的在于强化法西斯统治的“紧急状态法”。这再一次表明，西德统治集团坚持与德国人民为敌，死心塌地走希特勒法西斯的老路。
    西德统治集团为了实现吞并德意志民主共和国和恢复一九三七年纳粹德国疆界的野心，在加紧核武装、扩军备战的同时，竭力加强对国内的法西斯统治。
    十多年来，西德政府一直在处心积虑地为实行法西斯统治寻求所谓“合法”的前提。一九六○年西德内阁秘密通过了“紧急状态法”草案。这项法案规定，西德总理有权在他认为必要的时候宣布全国处于“紧急状态”。
    在“紧急状态”下，西德政府的权力几乎是无限的。它可以随意调遣西德全国的军队和警察，剥夺人民的言论、集会、迁徙等自由，对经济和交通等实行军事管制；它可以随意强征人民入伍、强迫出民工以及征用居民的各种财产，并且可以擅自颁布各种具有法律效力的条例等。
    西德统治集团从一九六○年起，曾多次把这项法西斯法案提交议会讨论，但是，由于西德人民的强烈反对，一直未能得逞。
    现在，西德国内阶级矛盾进一步加剧，工人运动和学生运动日益蓬勃高涨，惶恐不安的西德垄断资产阶级就再次搬出了这一法西斯法案，利用执政党在议会中的多数地位，操纵表决机器匆忙最后通过，以适应他们加紧镇压国内人民革命斗争的需要。
    据报道，西德当局由于害怕人民强大的抗议示威，在西德联邦议会最后对“紧急状态法”进行表决时，在议会外面布置了两千多名警察，封锁了所有通道。
