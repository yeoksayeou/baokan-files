U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Palmer arrived in Kinshasa, the capital of the Congo (Kinshasa), on the 23rd. According to reports, he will hold talks with the Congolese (Kinshasa) puppet president Mobutu to plot further U.S. imperialist schemes to control the Congo (Kinshasa).

Palmer stated that the United States "will do everything possible to encourage private investment in the Congo." He also eagerly praised the reactionary rule of the Mobutu puppet regime over the past few years as having "progress," and its "diplomatic activities are also successful." This is completely in line with the praise from the Soviet revisionist clique for Mobutu, indicating that this butcher of the Congolese (Kinshasa) people has become a common favorite of both U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

    美帝高级官员吹嘘蒙博托“外交成功”
    本报讯　美国负责非洲事务的助理国务卿帕尔默二十三日到刚果（金）首都金沙萨活动。据报道，他将同刚果（金）的傀儡总统蒙博托举行会谈，策划美帝国主义进一步控制刚果（金）的阴谋。
    帕尔默表示，美国“将尽一切可能鼓励私人在刚果投资”。他还竭力吹捧蒙博托傀儡集团最近几年的反动统治有“进步”，“外交活动也是成功的”。这同苏修集团对蒙博托的吹捧完全如出一辙，说明这个屠杀刚果（金）人民的刽子手，已经成了美帝苏修的共同的宠儿。
