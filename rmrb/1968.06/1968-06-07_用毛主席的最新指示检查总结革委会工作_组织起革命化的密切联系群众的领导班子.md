Members of revolutionary committees across the country are earnestly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, determined to forever remain loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, forever believe in, rely on, and protect the broad masses of the people, and resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 5th, the great teacher and great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." Members of revolutionary committees at all levels in provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country have been earnestly studying Chairman Mao's great instruction over the past few days, using Chairman Mao's great instruction to review and summarize the work of the revolutionary committees, and have been greatly inspired and educated. They said that the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction has once again pointed out the fundamental direction for the construction of revolutionary committees. We must, under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, implement Chairman Mao's great instruction and a series of latest instructions, and build revolutionary committees at all levels into revolutionary command departments that are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, closely linked with the masses, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people's state is to protect the people." Chairman Mao also said: "Our state system of people's democratic dictatorship is a powerful weapon to safeguard the fruits of the people's revolution and to oppose the plots of restoration by internal and external enemies. We must firmly grasp this weapon." Members of revolutionary committees at all levels in provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have earnestly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's instructions have extremely great historical significance for consolidating and strengthening the proletarian dictatorship. They said, our proletarian revolutionary power is to protect the people, to cherish the people, and to resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies. A responsible person from the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee said, whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people has always been the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution. In all our work, can we firmly stand on the side of the broad masses of the people? This is a major issue of whether or not to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, mobilize and firmly rely on the broad revolutionary masses, and resolutely, accurately, and fiercely strike down a handful of class enemies. The standing committee members of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee said, the attitude towards the masses and the revolutionary mass movement has always been the focal point of the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the counter-revolutionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev. The stronger the mass perspective, the higher the awareness of the line struggle. The closer to the masses, the deeper the understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the construction of revolutionary committees, we must firmly rely on "those who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end," unite the majority of cadres and masses, and resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies. The standing committee members of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee pointed out in their study that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line represents the interests of the broadest masses of the people, while the counter-revolutionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev is to suppress the masses of the people. We must earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, take Comrade Tan as an example, fully mobilize the masses, thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, launch a more powerful offensive against the class enemies, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes." "Only the people, and they alone, are the motive force of world history." Members of revolutionary committees at all levels across the country, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's great instructions as the beacon for consolidating and developing the newly born revolutionary committees. A responsible person from the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee pointed out that resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, persistently using the great Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, respecting the masses' pioneering spirit, and fully mobilizing the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm are the guarantees for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. A responsible person from the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee said, our great leader Chairman Mao most supports the revolutionary mass movement, most cherishes the masses, most believes in the masses, and is always heart-to-heart with the masses, setting a brilliant example for us. We must earnestly study and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, believe in and rely on the broad masses of the people in all our work, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental principle in reforming state organs is to link with the masses." All members of the Ma'anshan City Revolutionary Committee, who are currently studying at the Mao Zedong Thought study class, earnestly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and, following Chairman Mao's teachings, immediately went to the rural suburbs to participate in labor and study and propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The Jiaoyu County Revolutionary Committee in Hubei Province heard Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the radio, immediately recorded them word for word, and sent them to various units for earnest study, deep understanding, comprehensive implementation, and resolute action.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses; everything should be for the interests of the people, not for the interests of individuals or small groups." Members of revolutionary committees across the country, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, are determined to grasp the transformation of worldview in the fierce class struggle, and strive to be like Comrade Tan, infinitely loyal to the people, infinitely loyal to the Party, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, "be a cow for the people for life, and pull the revolutionary cart for life." All members of the standing committee of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee unanimously agreed during their study and discussion that the attitude towards the masses of the people is not a general issue of work style and work methods, but an issue of standing on what position, implementing what line, and establishing what worldview, an issue related to who holds power and serves whom, and an issue related to the nature and destiny of our power. Revolutionary cadres from the Yangpu District Revolutionary Committee in Shanghai said, the attitude towards the masses of the people has always been the touchstone for testing whether a person is a true revolutionary or a fake revolutionary, whether a proletarian revolutionary or a bourgeois representative, whether implementing the proletarian revolutionary line or the bourgeois counter-revolutionary line, and the dividing line between proletarian worldview and bourgeois worldview. We must follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, ignite a great revolution in our souls to smash the bourgeois "self" and establish the proletarian "public," and be like Comrade Tan, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with our lives, never leave the masses, and serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly" for life. Members of revolutionary committees in many factories, schools, and suburban people's communes in Chengdu all regard Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the highest standard for evaluating all the work of the revolutionary committees, and have been studying and self-examining the various works of the revolutionary committees since their establishment. They expressed their determination to forever be faithful servants of the people, to keep the newly born revolutionary committees forever young and revolutionary, and to ensure that the proletarian iron mountains and rivers will never change color!

    用毛主席的最新指示检查总结革委会工作
    组织起革命化的密切联系群众的领导班子
    全国各地革委会成员认真学习毛主席最新指示，决心永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，永远相信、依靠和保护广大人民群众，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    据新华社五日讯　伟大导师、伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”全国各省、市、自治区各级革命委员会成员，连日来认真学习毛主席的这一伟大指示，用毛主席的这一伟大指示检查和总结革命委员会的工作，从中受到了极大的鼓舞和教育。他们说，伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，又一次指明了革命委员会建设的根本方向。我们一定要在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部英明领导下，落实毛主席这一伟大指示和一系列最新指示，把各级革命委员会建设成为忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的密切联系群众的革命战斗指挥部，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民的国家是保护人民的。”毛主席又说：“我们的人民民主专政的国家制度是保障人民革命的胜利成果和反对内外敌人的复辟阴谋的有力的武器，我们必须牢牢地掌握这个武器。”各省、市、自治区各级革命委员会成员认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，一致认为毛主席的指示对于巩固和加强无产阶级专政具有极其伟大的历史意义。他们说，我们无产阶级的革命政权，就是要保护人民，就是要爱护人民，就是要狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人。山西省革命委员会负责人说，对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，历来是革命与反革命的分水岭。我们在一切工作中能否坚决站在广大人民群众一边，这是执行不执行毛主席的革命路线的大问题。我们一定要遵照毛主席的伟大教导，放手发动、坚决依靠广大革命群众，稳、准、狠地坚决打击一小撮阶级敌人。黑龙江省革命委员会的常委们说，对待群众和革命群众运动的态度，始终是毛主席无产阶级革命路线和中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线斗争的焦点，群众观点越强，路线斗争觉悟越高。靠群众越近，对毛主席革命路线理解越深。我们在革命委员会的建设中，一定要紧紧依靠“决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”，团结大多数干部和群众，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人。江苏省革命委员会常委在学习中指出，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就是代表最广大的人民群众的利益的，中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线就是镇压人民群众的。我们一定要认真落实毛主席的最新指示，以门合同志为榜样，充分发动群众，把中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线批倒批臭，向阶级敌人发起更猛烈的进攻，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”。“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”各地各级革命委员会成员学习了毛主席的最新指示，热烈赞颂毛主席的伟大指示是巩固和发展新生的革命委员会的指路明灯。辽宁省革命委员会负责人指出，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，坚持不懈地用伟大的毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，尊重群众的首创精神，充分发挥群众的革命积极性，这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的保证。甘肃省革命委员会负责人说，我们的伟大领袖毛主席最支持革命的群众运动，最爱护群众，最相信群众，永远和群众心连心，为我们树立了最光辉的榜样。我们一定要认真学习、坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，在一切工作中永远相信和依靠广大人民群众，尊重群众的首创精神。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”正在毛泽东思想学习班学习的马鞍山市革命委员会的全体成员，认真学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，遵照毛主席的这一教导，立即深入郊区农村参加劳动，同贫下中农一起学习、宣传毛主席的最新指示。湖北省嘉鱼县革命委员会从广播里听到伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，立即一字一句记录下来，发给各单位认真学习，深刻领会，全面贯彻，坚决照办。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。各地革命委员会成员学习了毛主席的最新指示，决心在激烈的阶级斗争中狠抓世界观的改造，做到象门合同志那样无限忠于人民，无限忠于党，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，“当一辈子人民的牛，拉一辈子革命的车”。河北省革命委员会常委会的全体成员在学习和讨论中一致认为，对待人民群众的态度，不是一般工作作风和工作方法问题，而是站在什么立场、执行什么路线、确立什么世界观的问题，是关系到为谁掌权、为谁服务的大问题，是关系到我们政权的性质和命运的问题。上海市杨浦区革命委员会的革命干部代表说，对待人民群众的态度问题，从来就是检验一个人是真革命还是假革命，是无产阶级革命家还是资产阶级代表人物，是贯彻无产阶级革命路线还是执行资产阶级反动路线的试金石，也是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的分水岭。我们一定要按照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在灵魂深处爆发一场大破资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级“公”字的大革命，象门合同志那样，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线，一辈子不脱离群众，一辈子“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务。成都市许多工厂、学校和郊区人民公社的革命委员会成员，都把毛主席的最新指示当作衡量革委会一切工作的最高标准，连日来边学习，边对照检查革命委员会建立以来的各项工作。他们表示，一定要永远做人民的忠实勤务员，让新生的革命委员会永葆革命的青春，保证无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色！
