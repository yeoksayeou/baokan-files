The revolutionary committee of Hongshui Commune in Qianxi County, Guizhou Province, has established a system of regular situation analysis meetings in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "without destruction, there can be no construction." They have discarded the revisionist goods of "business first" and "production first," emphasized proletarian politics, and focused on class struggle. Since the establishment of this system, the commune's revolutionary committee has frequently studied the new trends and problems in the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, and launched continuous attacks on class enemies. The entire commune is abuzz with revolutionary criticism.

Members of the commune's revolutionary committee and leaders of the production brigades and teams have jointly studied Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics. They have criticized the revisionist goods such as "business first" and "production first" spread by Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. They have discarded the various meeting systems of the past, which were imposed by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and only focused on production without paying attention to politics. They said that in the past, meetings only focused on grain, cotton, and oil, without distinguishing between enemies and friends. They are determined to follow the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions, insist on emphasizing proletarian politics, and frequently "investigate the dynamic situation of various classes in society" to keep abreast of the new trends and problems in rural class struggle and solve them. Thus, they established the system of holding regular situation analysis meetings. Each situation analysis meeting must "digest both ends": study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, study the relevant instructions and arrangements from the higher-level revolutionary committees, and study important editorials published in newspapers; report on the situation of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads from below, and introduce experiences from "points." Then, analyze and study the main problems of current class struggle, and compare the upper and lower ends to see how Chairman Mao has instructed and how they have acted, whether they have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Based on study, reporting, and analysis, they clarify the direction, unify thoughts, and make new battle arrangements.

Since the establishment of this system, the revolutionary committee of Hongshui Commune has conducted a relatively in-depth investigation and research on the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in the entire commune, and has timely guided the revolutionary struggle and production struggle. At the end of last year, they studied a series of Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the situation analysis meeting, studied Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, analyzed the situation of class struggle in the entire commune, and decided to launch continuous and fierce attacks on class enemies. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have launched a wave after wave of revolutionary criticism against the revisionist goods such as "self-management, self-reliance, and self-sufficiency," "four freedoms," "work points first," and "exploitation is beneficial" advocated by Chinese Khrushchev. This spring, they followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, studied the new situation of class struggle in the commune, launched a new attack on class enemies, criticized Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinguished," severely struck down the sabotage activities of class enemies, united the majority of the masses, and implemented dictatorship of the people over a handful of class enemies.

Because the revolutionary committee of Hongshui Commune insists on holding regular situation analysis meetings and timely grasps the new trends of class struggle, the revolutionary criticism in the entire commune has always been closely combined with the actual class struggle and various tasks in the region, like a surging spring tide, wave after wave. Even a small brigade like Jiefang, with only ninety-five households, has held over one thousand and thirty-nine large and small criticism meetings and family criticism meetings since last winter. In this commune, mountains, courtyards, construction sites, and the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants have all become battlefields for revolutionary criticism. Male and female commune members all strive to be critics.

In this commune, because proletarian politics have been emphasized and revolutionary criticism has been carried out deeply and persistently, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized to an unprecedented extent. Mao Zedong Thought study classes are increasingly numerous and better organized. The "three loyalties" activities of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line are being carried out vigorously among the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres.

    贵州黔西县洪水公社革委会建立形势分析会制度
    用毛泽东思想分析阶级斗争新动向
    广泛发动群众，深入开展革命大批判，毛泽东思想得到空前大普及
    据新华社贵阳十一日电　贵州省黔西县洪水公社革命委员会，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“不破不立”的教导，破除“业务挂帅”、“生产第一”等修正主义黑货，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争，建立了定期举行形势分析会的制度。这个公社的革委会自从建立这种制度以来，经常研究两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的新动向、新问题，不停顿地向阶级敌人发起进攻，全公社的革命大批判搞得热火朝天。
    这个公社的革委会成员和大队、生产队领导班子的成员，共同学习了毛主席和林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的指示，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和当地党内一小撮走资派散布的“业务挂帅”、“生产第一”等反革命修正主义黑货，破除了过去党内一小撮走资派在农村搞的那一套只管生产不管政治的种种会议制度。他们说，过去开会只抓粮棉油，不问敌我友。他们决心遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚持突出无产阶级政治，经常“调查社会各阶级的生动情况”，随时掌握农村阶级斗争的新动向，解决新问题，从而建立了定期召开形势分析会的制度。每次形势分析会都要“吃透两头”：学习毛主席的最新指示，学习上级革委会的有关指示和安排，学习报纸上发表的重要社论；汇报下面两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的情况，介绍“点”上的经验。然后，分析研究当前阶级斗争的主要问题，并且把上、下两头结合起来相对照，看毛主席是怎样教导的，自己是怎样做的，是不是紧跟了毛主席的伟大战略部署。在学习、汇报、分析的基础上，明确方向，统一思想，做出新的战斗部署。
    洪水公社革委会从建立这种制度以来，对全公社的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争情况作了比较深入的调查研究，及时地指导了革命斗争和生产斗争。去年底，他们在形势分析会上学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示，研究了毛主席的伟大战略部署，分析了全公社阶级斗争的形势，决定向阶级敌人发起不停顿的猛烈进攻。广大贫下中农和革命干部，对中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”、“剥削有功”等修正主义黑货，展开了一浪高过一浪的革命大批判。今年开春后，他们又紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，研究了公社阶级斗争的新形势，向阶级敌人发起新的进攻，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，狠狠打击了阶级敌人的破坏活动，团结了大多数群众，对一小撮阶级敌人实行了群众专政。
    洪水公社革委会由于坚持定期召开形势分析会，及时掌握了阶级斗争的新动向，全公社的革命大批判始终紧紧结合着本地区阶级斗争的实际和各项任务，势如滚滚春潮，一浪高过一浪。仅九十五户的解放大队，去冬至今，开的大小批判会和家庭批判会已达一千零三十九次。在这个公社，山村、院落、工地和贫下中农的家庭，都成了开展革命大批判的战场，男女社员都争当批判家。
    在这个公社，由于突出了无产阶级政治，深入持久地开展革命大批判，战无不胜的毛泽东思想得到空前大普及，毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好。无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，在广大革命群众和革命干部中开展得轰轰烈烈。
