Thousands of workers and students in Tokyo and Fukuoka hold rallies and demonstrations, condemning Sato for following the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam and anti-China policies.

	BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- According to a report by the Oriental News Agency, workers and students in Tokyo and Fukuoka held rallies and demonstrations on the evening of the 19th, strongly demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

	Eight years ago, on June 19, the reactionary Liberal Democratic Party government, despite strong opposition from the Japanese people, forcibly passed this treacherous treaty in the House of Representatives.

	That evening, about 3,000 workers and students gathered in Hibiya Park in Tokyo, strongly condemning the crime of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries in signing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and condemning the Sato government's more reactionary and treacherous policies than any previous Liberal Democratic Party government.

	A worker representative speaking at the rally pointed out: U.S. imperialism has been engulfed in the storm of anti-U.S. struggles by the people of the world. The world situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable for U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and increasingly favorable for revolutionary people. He emphasized, "Let us Japanese workers and students march forward side by side with the people of China, Vietnam, France, and American blacks!"

	After the rally, workers and students marched to the Diet and the Prime Minister's Official Residence to hold demonstrations.

	In Fukuoka, 1,000 workers and students held a mass rally demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

	Japanese Socialist Party member Yuzuru Kizaki spoke at the rally, strongly condemning the Sato reactionary government for actually participating in the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam and pursuing anti-China policies. He said: Sato allows U.S. imperialism to ride roughshod over the Japanese people, which is something the Japanese people cannot tolerate.

	After the rally, the participants, holding high red flags, marched to the front of the U.S. Consulate to hold demonstrations. They shouted:

	"U.S. imperialism, get out of Asia!"
	"Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!"
	"Withdraw the U.S. military from the Tachikawa base!"

	According to a report by the Oriental News Agency on June 18, students of the Medical School of Tokyo University held a rally on the 17th in the school, strongly protesting the Sato reactionary government's dispatch of a large number of armed police to suppress students occupying the school headquarters, and condemning the despicable actions of the Japan Communist Party revisionists in disrupting the student struggle.

	Students participating in the rally expressed their determination to continue the strike struggle, to smash the reactionary educational and medical systems of the Sato government, and to fight to the end to revoke the school authorities' unreasonable punishment of students.

	Students of the Medical School of Tokyo University have been on strike since January this year, opposing the reactionary resident doctor system imposed by the Sato government. More than 100 students occupied the university headquarters, the "Yasuda Lecture Hall," on the 15th and set up barricades at the entrance, forcing the school to stop work. The students demanded the revocation of the unreasonable punishment of students and the resignation of the president. They raised the red flag on the roof of the "Yasuda Lecture Hall" and hung large, militant slogans on the walls. (Photo attached)

    日本人民不许美日反动派胡作非为
    东京和福冈数千工人学生示威，谴责佐藤追随美帝侵越反华
    新华社二十日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本东京和福冈市的工人和学生十九日晚上分别举行集会和示威游行，强烈要求废除日美“安全条约”。
    八年前的六月十九日，反动的自由民主党政府，不顾日本人民的强烈反对，在众议院强行通过了这个卖国条约。
    这天晚上，东京大约有三千名工人和学生在日比谷公园举行集会，强烈谴责美日反动派签定日美“安全条约”的罪行，谴责佐藤政府推行比历届自由民主党政府更加反动的卖国政策。
    在集会上讲话的工人代表指出：美帝国主义已陷入全世界人民反美斗争的怒潮之中。世界形势正在一天天不利于美帝国主义及其走狗，而大大有利于革命人民。他强调说，让我们日本工人和学生，同中国、越南以及法国人民和美国黑人并肩前进吧！
    会后，工人和学生们到国会和首相官邸举行了示威游行。
    福冈市有一千名工人和学生举行了要求废除日美“安全条约”的群众集会。
    日本社会党议员楢崎弥之助在集会上讲话，强烈谴责佐藤反动政府事实上参与了美帝侵越战争，推行反对中国的政策。他说：佐藤听任美帝国主义骑在日本人民头上，这是日本人民所决不能容忍的。
    会后，与会者高举红旗，到美国领事馆前举行了示威游行。他们高呼：
  “美帝国主义从亚洲滚出去！”“粉碎日美‘安全条约’！”“撤除美军板付基地！”
    据新华社十八日讯据东方通讯社报道：日本东京大学医疗系的学生十七日在校内举行集会，强烈抗议佐藤反动政府派出大批武装警察镇压占领这个学校总部的学生，并谴责日共修正主义分子破坏学生斗争的卑劣行径。
    参加集会的学生表示要坚持罢课斗争，为粉碎佐藤政府的反动教育制度和医疗制度，为撤销学校当局无理处分学生的决定而斗争到底。
    东京大学医疗系的学生在今年一月以来就开始举行了罢课斗争，反对佐藤政府制定的反动的实习医生制度。一百多名学生十五日占领了大学总部所在地“安田讲堂”，并在讲堂门口设置了路障，迫使学校停止工作。学生们要求撤销对学生的无理处分，要求校长辞职。他们在“安田讲堂”屋顶上升起了红旗，在墙上悬挂了巨幅战斗性的标语。（附图片）
    日本革命人民游行示威，反对美国侵略者。
