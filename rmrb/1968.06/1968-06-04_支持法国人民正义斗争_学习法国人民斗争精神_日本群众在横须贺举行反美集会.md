	Godanawa Prefecture and young workers and students from neighboring prefectures, numbering more than 2,000, held a rally on June 2 in Yokosuka, where the U.S. Seventh Fleet base is located. They expressed their resolute support for the just struggle of French workers and students, opposed U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, and opposed the entry of the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" and all U.S. fleets into Japanese ports.

	A young worker from Godanawa Prefecture said at the rally: The brave struggle of French workers and students, who have overcome the obstacles and sabotage of the traitorous French Communist Party revisionists, has greatly inspired Japanese workers.

	He said, we must respond to the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Vietnamese people, the anti-violence struggle of American blacks, and the just struggles of workers and students in Europe and North America. We must launch a new high tide of anti-American patriotic struggle in Japan. He said: "Let us march forward under the banner of 'Workers of the world, unite!'"

	A national railway worker at the rally condemned the criminal acts of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuemon. He said: "The Japanese Communist Party revisionist group is doing its utmost to slander the anti-American struggle of young workers and is plotting a counter-revolutionary conspiracy to split the Japanese workers' struggle. To oppose imperialism, we must oppose revisionism."

	The rally adopted a message of support for French workers and students. The message said: "We, Japanese workers and students, firmly support the French workers and students who are bravely fighting against the French reactionary government. We will learn from the French workers and students who have inherited the revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune and fight more bravely against U.S. imperialism in Japan."

	After the rally, the young workers and students joined another rally opposing the entry of the U.S. nuclear fleet into Japan. At this rally, a resolution was passed demanding the withdrawal of U.S. military bases in Japan and opposing the entry of the U.S. nuclear fleet into Japan. After the rally, the participants held a massive demonstration. They shouted in front of the U.S. Navy Command in Japan, "Oppose the entry of the U.S. nuclear fleet into Yokosuka Port!" "Yankees, get out of Japan! Get out of Asia!" "Withdraw U.S. military bases in Japan!" "Down with the reactionary Sato government!" and other slogans.

    支持法国人民正义斗争  学习法国人民斗争精神
    日本群众在横须贺举行反美集会
    新华社东京三日电　神奈川县和来自邻近各县的青年工人和学生二千多人，二日在设有美国第七舰队基地的横须贺举行集会，表示坚决支持法国工人和学生正在展开的正义斗争，反对美帝国主义侵略越南，反对美国核航空母舰“企业号”和一切美国舰队进入日本海港。
    神奈川县一位青年工人代表在集会上说：法国工人和学生排除法国人民的叛徒法共修正主义者的阻碍和破坏所进行的英勇斗争，给了日本工人以极大的鼓舞。
    他说，我们必须同越南人民的抗美救国斗争、美国黑人的抗暴斗争以及欧洲和北美的工人和学生的正义斗争相呼应，在日本掀起反美爱国斗争的新高潮。他说：“让我们高举‘全世界无产者，联合起来’的大旗前进吧！”
    一位国营铁路工人在集会上谴责日共宫本修正主义集团破坏日本人民斗争的罪恶行为。他说：“日共修正主义集团竭力诽谤青年工人的反美斗争，策划着分裂日本工人斗争的反革命阴谋。我们要反对帝国主义就必须反对修正主义。”
    集会通过了给法国工人和学生的声援信。声援信说：“我们日本工人和学生坚决支持英勇地同法国反动政府斗争的法国工人和学生。我们将向继承巴黎公社革命传统的法国工人和学生学习，在日本更勇敢地同美帝国主义斗争到底。”
    参加集会的青年工人和学生在集会结束以后，和另一个反对美国核舰队进入日本的集会汇合。在这个集会上通过了向美日反动政府要求撤除设在日本的美军基地和反对美国核舰队进入日本的决议。集会后，与会者举行了声势浩大的示威游行，他们在美国驻日海军司令部门前愤怒地高呼“反对美国核舰队进入横须贺港！”“美国佬从日本滚出去！从亚洲滚出去！”“撤除美国在日军事基地！”“打倒佐藤反动政府！”等口号。
