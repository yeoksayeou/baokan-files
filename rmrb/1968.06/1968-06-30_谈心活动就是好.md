Talking Heart-to-Heart is Good
Worker Wang Shimin of the Shanghai Hongqiao Airport of the Civil Aviation Administration of China

The news that Old Huang and Little Zhou from the Pipeline Group had formed a "one help one" and "one red pair" spread throughout the Shanghai Hongqiao Airport Operations Team. Upon hearing this news, some believed it, while others doubted it. Why was that?

The story was as follows: Little Zhou had a bad habit of liking to hear praise but not criticism. Over the past few years, through studying Chairman Mao's works, he had made some progress. However, recently, due to the influence of anarchist tendencies in society, he sometimes showed signs of not following assignments in his work. The group leader, Old Huang, and the comrades criticized him in a meeting, but he didn't listen at all. After the meeting, Old Huang went to talk to him, but they talked for a long time, and he didn't utter a word.

A few days later, the Pipeline Group held a democratic life meeting. The meeting decided to re-adjust the "one help one" and "one red pair" activity pairs. At first, many comrades formed pairs voluntarily. However, no one took the initiative to pair with Little Zhou. On one hand, Little Zhou was stubborn and didn't listen to criticism and advice, so pairing with him might result in "not getting along." On the other hand, Little Zhou felt that he was already behind, so he didn't take the initiative to find anyone else. Therefore, by the end of the meeting, he was still a "lone wolf."

At this moment, Old Huang was engaged in a fierce struggle in his mind. He thought: "It seems that no one will pair with Little Zhou. I should take the initiative to pair with him." But then he thought: "Little Zhou currently has some grievances against me. We've talked several times before, but it didn't work out. What if we still can't get along?" At this moment, he looked up and saw Chairman Mao's portrait on the wall, as if Chairman Mao was affectionately saying to him: "Communist Party members' attitude towards backward people is not to despise them or look down on them, but to be close to them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward." Chairman Mao's great teachings immediately made him see clearly, so Old Huang took the initiative to find Little Zhou and enthusiastically said: "Little Zhou, Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Carrying out heart-to-heart talks is a good method.' Let's start by talking heart-to-heart." At the beginning, he criticized himself for not following Chairman Mao's latest instructions, only knowing how to criticize but not doing a good job of ideological work. Although the words were few, because of his sincere and enthusiastic attitude, Little Zhou felt warm in his heart. After a while, Old Huang continued: "Little Zhou, you don't know, at today's democratic life meeting, I almost made a mistake." "What mistake?" "At first, I wanted to pair with you, but then I thought, I might not get along with you, and by the end of the year, I might not be red, and the masses might say that this active member of studying Chairman Mao's works can't even carry out help-learning activities." This is my selfishness. This is disloyalty to Chairman Mao!"

Loyalty is seen in actions. Old Huang boldly exposed his private thoughts and fought against them, deeply moved by his loyalty to Chairman Mao. Little Zhou thought: "Clearly, it was my mistake, why didn't I admit it? Why was I afraid of others' criticism? Old Huang criticized me and helped me, it was for my progress, why didn't I feel grateful to him but instead had grievances against him? Old Huang and I are both Chairman Mao's soldiers, why didn't I listen to Chairman Mao's words but instead wanted to be at odds with Old Huang?" Thinking of this, he couldn't help but blurt out: "Ah, this isn't your mistake, it's my selfishness acting up." Little Zhou stood up and grabbed Old Huang's hand, excitedly saying: "Old Huang, I... I was wrong! I'm sorry to you and the comrades." Saying this, he couldn't say any more. Two streams of tears flowed down his cheeks.

"Little Zhou, don't be sad. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'To fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism.' For the selfish thoughts in our minds, we must boldly expose them and fiercely fight against them." "Old Huang, what should I do in the future?" "Listen to Chairman Mao's words, for the people's interests, insist on what is good, and correct what is wrong. Put down the burden and move forward lightly!" "Good! Let's do it this way!" Thus, the two hands clasped even tighter.

After some more days, another piece of news spread like wildfire in the Operations Team: Little Zhou had changed! Little Zhou sacrificed two days off and went with Old Huang to help the poor and lower-middle peasants in the production brigade near the airport! This time, no one doubted it. Everyone said in unison: "Heart-to-heart talks are good!"

### 谈心活动就是好

    谈心活动就是好
    中国民航局上海虹桥航空站工人　王世敏
    管道组的老黄同小周结成了“一帮一”“一对红”的消息，在上海虹桥航空站场务队传开了。听了这消息，有人相信，有人怀疑，这到底为什么呢？
    事情原来是这样的：小周有一种喜欢听表扬，不喜欢听批评的坏毛病。这几年，通过学习毛主席著作，有了一些进步。前些时候，由于社会上无政府主义思潮的影响，他在工作上有时又产生了不服从分配的现象。组长老黄和同志们在会上批评他，他根本听不进去。会后，老黄又去找他谈心，但是谈了老半天，他连一声也没有吭。
    过了几天以后，管道组召开民主生活会。会上决定重新调整“一帮一”“一对红”活动的对子。一开始，许多同志都在自愿基础上结了对子。可是，没有一个人主动找小周的。一方面，小周的脾气固执，听不进批评和意见，和他结了对子怕“谈不拢”。另一方面，小周觉得自己反正落后了，也不主动找别人，所以，到会议结束的时候，他还是个“单干户”。
    再说，此时此刻，老黄在思想上却展开了一场激烈的斗争。他想：“看来不会有人找小周结对子了，我应该主动同他结才对啊！”可转而一想：“小周目前对我正有意见，过去几次谈话都没谈拢，要是总谈不拢，可怎么办呢？”这时，他一抬头看见墙上的毛主席像，仿佛毛主席在亲切地对他说：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”毛主席的伟大教导，顿时使他心明眼亮，于是，老黄便主动地去找小周，热情地说：“小周呀，毛主席教导我们：‘开展谈心活动，这个方法很好。’咱们俩先谈谈知心话吧。”一开始，他就检讨了自己没有遵照毛主席的最新指示办事，光知道批评，没有很好地做思想工作。话不多，但是由于态度诚恳热情，使小周心里感到热呼呼的。过了一会，老黄又接着说：“小周呀，你不知道，在今天的民主生活会上，我差点犯了个错误。”“什么错误？”“开始我想同你结对子，可后来一想，又怕和你结对子了。”“怕什么？”“我怕咱们再谈不拢，年终红不起来，怕群众说我这个学习毛主席著作积极分子连帮学活动都开展不起来。这是我的私心杂念。这是对毛主席不忠啊！”
    忠不忠，看行动。老黄大胆地亮私斗私，对毛主席无限忠诚，深深感动了小周。他想：“明明是自己错了，自己为什么不想承认，又怕别人批评呢？老黄批评我，帮助我，是为我进步，我为什么不但不感激他，反而对他有意见呢？我和老黄都是毛主席的战士，而我为什么不听毛主席的话，偏要和老黄搞得‘势不两立’呢？”想着想着，他不禁脱口而出：“唉，这不是你的错，这是我的私心杂念在作怪。”小周“呼”地站了起来，一把抓住老黄的手，激动地说：“老黄啊，我……我错了！我对不起你和同志们。”说到这里，他再也说不下去了。两行热泪夺眶而出。
      “小周，别难受。毛主席教导我们：‘要斗私，批修。’对我们头脑里的私心杂念，就是要大胆地亮，狠狠地斗。”“老黄，你说我今后应该怎么办？”“听毛主席的话，为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的。放下包袱，轻装前进！”“好！就这样办！”于是，两双手握得更紧了。
    又过了一些日子，又有一个消息象长了翅膀似的在场务队传开了：小周变了！小周一连牺牲了两个公休日，和老黄一起到机场附近生产队帮贫下中农劳动去了！不过，这次再也没有人怀疑了，大家都异口同声地说：“谈心活动就是好！”
