In June, the busy season for harvesting grain, the vast land of Qinchuan is bustling with activity. At the foot of Qinling Mountains, where the Yellow and Wei Rivers converge, in Tongguan County, red flags are flying everywhere, and songs are echoing through the fields. In the fields, by the rivers, and at the threshing grounds, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are seizing every moment to study and apply Chairman Mao's works earnestly, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide their thoughts and actions. What follows are just a few snapshots from several production teams.

Military and Civilians Study the Treasure Book at the Field's Edge

Under the scorching sun, members of Brigade One of Wucun People's Commune's Wuhu Zhang Production Team, along with the supporting soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, gathered as usual during their break from harvesting wheat to read Chairman Mao's quotations. An old peasant said, "Reading a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations gives me boundless energy and direction in my work."

Following this, the PLA soldier read out the order from our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, approved by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, posthumously conferring the title of "a good cadre loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line" on Comrade Men He, along with Comrade Men He's heroic deeds. During the discussion, the poor and lower-middle peasant members spoke passionately, eager to express their thoughts.

Militia platoon leader Su Zhonglin said, "Comrade Men He fought for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line all his life. He is a great example for me to learn from. During this busy summer harvest season, I will definitely heighten my revolutionary vigilance and resolutely fight against class enemies to protect the harvest."

Women's team leader Wang Shulan first recited a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations: "Without a people's army, there is nothing." She continued, "I will definitely learn from Comrade Men He's spirit of selflessness and dedication, firmly safeguard collective interests, and oppose any selfish behavior."

The PLA soldier firmly expressed his resolve to learn from Comrade Men He, care for the people wholeheartedly, learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and work together with the commune members to do a good job in this year's "three summers."

The half-hour study session had just ended, and everyone, singing "The Ship Needs a Helmsman," returned to their work.

Family Meeting to Criticize and Fight Selfishness and Revisionism

In the evening, the family of militia platoon leader Ma Anwa from the first production team of Nanxun Brigade in Taijiao People's Commune gathered to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using Mao Zedong Thought to reflect on their thoughts and actions over the past few days of harvesting.

Study group leader Ma Anwa spoke first: "Chairman Mao teaches us to 'fight selfishness and criticize revisionism.' The other day, the brigade leader sent me to deliver cotton seeds to the oil mill. I thought, since our family's construction materials are stored near the oil mill, I might as well bring them back at the same time. But just as I was about to leave, the brigade leader rushed over and asked me to stay and repair the grain storage. The cotton seeds were to be delivered by someone else. At that moment, I was not happy. Then, Chairman Mao's teachings echoed in my ears: 'Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses; act in the interests of the people, not in the interests of individuals or small groups.' I realized that the word 'self' was playing tricks in my mind. As soon as I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, my mind became clear, and I immediately picked up my tools and went to repair the grain storage."

Ma Anwa had just finished speaking when his sister Ma Minghua added: "Brother's self-criticism is good. For the collective, he does not calculate personal gains. I also have something to share: the other day, after harvesting the wheat by the village, I went to the embankment to harvest more. There was a patch of wheat that was hard to harvest, and I struggled with my thoughts. Then I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: 'The more difficult the place, the more we should go, that is a good comrade.' So, without a word, I ran to the embankment and started harvesting with all my might, the more I harvested, the faster I went."

The brother and sister's exemplary actions of criticizing selfishness and establishing public spirit had a great impact on the whole family. Grandpa Ma Zuochang also expressed his determination to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, actively participate in collective labor, and fight against selfishness and revisionism.

The study session ended, and the whole family, under the scorching sun, joined the wheat harvesting battle.

Harvesting Under the Stars

In the evening, Brigade Five's leader Guo Xinxian of Xianfeng Brigade in Gangkou People's Commune went to the fields to check the ripeness of the wheat. He discovered that sixteen mu of wheat on the north side of the ditch were fully ripe and needed to be harvested immediately. Delaying for a day would result in losses. However, the next day, all the labor force in the brigade was already scheduled. What to do? He thought of the PLA soldiers supporting the summer harvest, who were not afraid of fatigue, and immediately returned to the village, called twenty young and strong commune members, and together studied Chairman Mao's quotations: "Promote the spirit of bravery in battle, fearlessness of sacrifice, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." Guo Xinxian explained the situation to everyone. Everyone said, Comrade Men He sacrificed his life to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We should learn from the PLA and resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions. For the victory of the first summer harvest after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, we cannot be afraid of hardship and fatigue. Immediately, a shock team was formed, and they harvested the wheat under the stars that night.

Sending Mao Zedong Thought to the Fields and Threshing Grounds

As soon as the wheat turned yellow, the staff of the Gangkou Supply and Marketing Cooperative discussed how to support the summer harvest. Someone said, "In previous years, the variety of goods we delivered was too limited and did not meet the people's needs. This year, we should bring more goods and increase some income." Everyone heard this and felt something was wrong, so they sat down to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." After discussion, everyone's understanding was unified, and they decided to propagate Mao Zedong Thought during this summer harvest, follow the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, and thoroughly criticize the "business tactics" spread by Chinese Khrushchev.

As soon as the wheat harvest began, the revolutionary committee of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, along with several comrades, formed a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, which was also a mobile delivery team. They carried Chairman Mao's works, Chairman Mao's portraits, and pulled carts, going to each production team, reading Chairman Mao's quotations to the commune members by the threshing grounds and fields, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, supplying revolutionary treasure books, and selling summer harvest tools. The poor and lower-middle peasants reflected: "The comrades from the Supply and Marketing Cooperative really think of everything."

    喜看稻菽千重浪　遍地英雄下夕烟
    ——陕西潼关县革命群众在夏收中宣传和学习毛泽东思想的动人事迹
    八百里秦川的六月，正是龙口夺食的大忙季节。秦岭脚下，黄、渭交汇处的潼关县，遍地红旗飘飘，歌声阵阵。在地头、田间、场边，广大贫下中农抓紧时间，努力活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想指导自己的思想和行动。这里记载的只是几个生产队的一些片断。
    军民地头学宝书
    烈日当空，吴村公社五虎张大队一队的社员和支农的解放军同志，照例在割麦休息时间朗读毛主席语录。一位贫农老大爷说：“学一段毛主席语录，身上有使不完的劲，做活就有了方向。”
    接着解放军同志给大家读了我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲自批准，中共中央、中央军委、中央文革追授门合同志以“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”的光荣称号的命令和门合同志英雄事迹。讨论时，贫下中农社员满怀激动的心情，争先恐后地发言。
    民兵排长苏中林说：“门合同志为捍卫毛主席的革命路线奋斗终生，他是我学习的好榜样。在夏收大忙中，我一定提高革命警惕，坚决和阶级敌人作斗争，保卫夏收。”
    妇女队长王淑兰先念了一段毛主席语录：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”接着说：“我一定好好学习门合同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，坚决维护集体利益，反对任何自私自利的行为。”
    解放军同志坚决表示学习门合，处处关心群众，向贫下中农学习，和社员一道搞好今年“三夏”工作。
    半小时的学习会刚结束，大家高唱着《大海航行靠舵手》，又挥镰上阵了。
    家庭斗私批修会
    太要公社南巡大队第一生产队民兵排长马安娃一家人围坐在一起，学习毛主席的最新指示，用毛泽东思想对照开镰几天来各人的思想和行动。
    学习组长马安娃首先发言说：毛主席教导我们“要斗私，批修”。前天，队长派我往油磨上送棉籽榨油，我想，咱家盖房用的木料放在油磨附近，这下可以顺便捎回来了。谁知我正准备出发时，队长又急急忙忙赶来，要我留下来整修粮食仓库，棉籽让别人去送。当时我心里很不乐意。这时，毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”的教导在我耳边响起了。我发觉自己头脑里“私”字正在作怪。一想起毛主席的教导，我的心豁亮了，立刻扛起工具，整修粮食仓库去了。
    马安娃的话刚说完，妹妹马明花接着说：哥哥这次斗私斗得好，为了集体，不打个人小算盘。我也有一件事：那天，割完了村边的麦子，又去埝边割。有片麦子难割，我思想斗争开了。这时我想到毛主席的教导：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”于是，我二话没说，就向埝畔跑去，一股劲地割起来，越割越快。
    兄妹两人破私立公的模范行动，对全家人启发很大。爷爷马作昌也表示决心，一定要照毛主席的指示办事，积极参加集体劳动。
    学习会结束了，全家人迎着烈日，投入了麦收战斗。
    星夜忙收割
    傍晚，港口公社先锋大队五队队长郭新祥到地里复查麦子的黄熟情况。发现沟北边有十六亩麦子已经熟透，要马上收割，推迟一天，就要受到损失。可是，第二天队里的劳力全安排光了。怎么办？他想起来队支援夏收的解放军同志不怕疲劳的革命精神，就立刻回到村上，叫来了二十名青壮年社员，共同学习了毛主席语录：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”郭新祥向大家讲明了情况。大家说，门合同志为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，献出了自己的生命，我们要向解放军学习，坚决按毛主席的指示办事，为夺取革命委员会建立后第一个夏收的胜利，不能怕苦怕累。于是，立即组成了一支突击队，连夜就把那块麦子抢收回来了。
    把毛泽东思想送到场头田间
    麦子刚黄，港口供销社的同志就对如何支援夏收展开了讨论。有人说，往年咱送的东西花样太少，满足不了群众要求，今年应多带些商品，还可以增加点收入。大家一听，觉得味儿不对，便坐下来学习毛主席的教导：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”经过讨论，统一了认识，大家决心要在今年夏收中，坚持宣传毛泽东思想，走突出无产阶级政治的道路，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“生意经”。
    麦收大忙一开始，供销社革委会主任和几个同志成立了一支毛泽东思想宣传队，同时又是流动送货队。他们带上毛主席著作、毛主席像，拉着架子车，每到一个生产队，就在场边、地头给社员念毛主席语录，宣传毛主席最新指示，供应革命宝书，卖夏收用具。贫下中农反映说：供销社的同志想得真周到。
