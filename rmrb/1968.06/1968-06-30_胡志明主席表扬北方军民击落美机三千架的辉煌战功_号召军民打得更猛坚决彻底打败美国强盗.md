Chairman Ho Chi Minh wrote a letter on June 27 to the military and civilians of North Vietnam, enthusiastically praising them for shooting down 3,000 American aggressor aircraft by June 25. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Comrades, Soldiers, and Cadres:

While the heroic South is fighting fiercely and achieving great victories, the North has shot down the 3,000th American aggressor aircraft.

Thus, both the North and the South are fighting well!

The brave military and civilians of the North have not only shot down many American aircraft but have also overcome the American aggressors in transportation, construction, economic development, and ensuring the people's livelihood. After more than three years of anti-American resistance, socialist North Vietnam has become more consolidated and is always fully committed to fulfilling its duties to our southern brethren.

I am very pleased to represent the Party Central Committee and the government in praising the military and civilians of the North for their excellent production and combat performance.

I enthusiastically praise the military and civilians of the Fourth Military Region for their bravery in smashing all the savage tactics of the American aggressors.

I especially praise the military and civilians of Quang Binh Province for their excellent performance in shooting down the 3,000th American aircraft and for presenting a banner of honor to a certain unit. This is the common achievement of our North Vietnamese military and civilians.

The American aggressors have suffered a great defeat. However, they still refuse to give up their war crimes of invading the South and destroying the North.

All comrades, soldiers, and cadres across the country must not be complacent due to victory. We must always be vigilant, closely united, fight more fiercely, produce better, and overcome our shortcomings to decisively and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

We will surely win and march forward bravely!

With warm and victorious greetings!

Ho Chi Minh

    新华社河内二十八日电　据此间报纸二十八日报道：胡志明主席二十七日写信给越南北方军民，热烈表扬他们到二十五日为止已经击落美国强盗飞机三千架的辉煌战功。表扬信全文如下：亲爱的全体同胞、战士和干部们：
    当英雄的南方正在打得猛烈、取得巨大胜利的时候，北方又击落了第三千架美国强盗飞机。
    这样，南北两方都打得好！
    勇敢的北方军民不仅击落许多美国飞机，而且还在交通运输、建设经济、保证人民生活等各方面都战胜了美国强盗。经过三年多的抗美救国斗争，社会主义北方更加巩固了，并且时刻全心全力地履行对南方骨肉同胞的义务。
    我十分高兴地代表党中央和政府表扬北方军民展开竞赛，生产好，战斗好。
    我热烈表扬第四军区军民不愧站在北方的前线，英勇粉碎了美国强盗的一切野蛮手段。
    我特别表扬广平军民打得好，击落了第三千架美国飞机，并且把一面荣誉锦旗赠给某单位。这是我们北方军民的共同成绩。
    美国强盗已经大败。但他们仍然未肯放弃侵略南方、破坏北方的战争罪行。
    全国同胞、战士和干部切不可因为胜利而主观。必须时刻提高警惕，紧密团结，打得更猛，生产得更好，发扬优点，改正缺点，坚决彻底打败美国强盗。
    稳操全胜勇向前！
    致亲切和决胜的敬礼！
                          胡志明
