The fundamental difference between Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and the counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev lies in whether to cultivate socially conscious, cultured laborers or to cultivate "spiritual aristocrats."

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our educational policy should aim to develop the moral, intellectual, and physical well-being of the students, and to turn them into socially conscious, cultured laborers." "The cadres of our Party and state are ordinary laborers, not overlords sitting on the heads of the people."

The laboring people are the driving force behind world history. It is the millions upon millions of ordinary laborers who have created the material and cultural wealth that forms the basis for human existence and development; it is the millions upon millions of ordinary laborers who, as the decisive force in class struggle, have pushed history forward.

The dictatorship of the proletariat is a regime representing the interests of millions upon millions of ordinary laborers. To ensure that this regime never changes color, we must, as Lenin taught, "place the power completely, entirely, and absolutely in the hands of the laboring people, those who live by labor."

The first socialist state built by Lenin and Stalin was seized by the Khrushchev revisionist clique, a painful lesson from history. Therefore, the fundamental purpose of our proletarian education is to cultivate and produce millions upon millions of ordinary laborers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thus consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In contrast, all exploiting classes throughout history have used education as a tool for perpetuating their rule. "The mind labors, the body labors," this is the principle they uphold. A small clique of spiritual aristocrats who sit atop the laborers is the inevitable product of such education.

For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices, in order to realize their evil plot of usurping the Party and the country and restoring capitalism, have shamelessly opposed Chairman Mao's brilliant directive to cultivate ordinary laborers. They have madly shouted: "Our goal should be to cultivate people to the level of being able to serve as cadres, technicians, and engineers," "Master one skill, and you will become famous and successful." This "great man" sometimes talks about going down to the countryside and factories, but he advocates "farming for a few years, working for a few years" to achieve the "ideal" of becoming a "leader" in the Party, government, labor unions, and youth leagues. He has designed a "roadmap to officialdom" for young people: by "being able to farm," "having culture," and "getting along well with the masses," one can become a cadre in the countryside, county, or province, and even go to the center. He encourages young people to "promote your experience nationwide, thus realizing your great ideal," and to strive to "have your name written in history when it is written," claiming that "there is no greater personal fame and profit than this." In this way, "one can have everything."

The Chinese Khrushchev is using the rotten bourgeois worldview to poison and deceive young people, luring them to climb the ladder of personal struggle, "striving hard" to "climb up," to achieve the goals of "fame and fortune," and "promotion and wealth." This fully exposes his evil intention to cultivate "spiritual aristocrats."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shattered the Chinese Khrushchev's dream of restoring capitalism. His shameful scheme to cultivate "spiritual aristocrats" has also failed. Amidst the triumphant songs of victory, the Red Guards of colleges and universities and the broad masses of young intellectuals are actively responding to the battle call of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, turning towards the countryside, the border, the factories, and the grassroots, rushing to the places where the motherland needs them the most. This is a new situation brought about by the revolution changing people's spiritual outlook.

Going to the countryside, to the border, to the factories, to the grassroots, to the front lines of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, tempering and growing in the great crucible of the workers and peasants, this is the need of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and it is also the necessary path for cultivating young intellectuals into ordinary laborers. This is the fundamental way to implement and carry out Chairman Mao's great strategic policy of cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

In the current graduation assignment work, there is still a fierce struggle over whether to take the path of ordinary laborers or the path of "spiritual aristocrats," which is concentrated in the issue of whether to adhere to the "four orientations" or to oppose the "four orientations." This is a continuation of the long-term struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and the counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev. Our struggle against erroneous thoughts such as seeking comfort, fearing to "waste talent," and longing for the city within our own minds is a struggle against the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line. We must further study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, carry out thorough and in-depth revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev's counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line, and completely eliminate its poison.

The direction has been indicated, and the road is wide open. Revolutionary young comrades, the motherland is calling, the revolution is calling. Let us raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the revolutionary forerunners, go to the places where the motherland needs us the most and where it is the hardest, forever be an ordinary laborer who serves the people wholeheartedly, and forever be a proletarian warrior who consciously defends Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

    永远做普通劳动者
    天达　歌稠
    是培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，还是培养
  “精神贵族”，这是毛主席无产阶级教育路线同中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的根本分歧。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”
    劳动人民是创造世界历史的动力。正是千百万普通劳动者，创造了作为人类生存和发展基础的物质和文化财富；正是千百万普通劳动者，作为阶级斗争的决定力量，推进着历史的车轮。
    无产阶级专政是代表千百万普通劳动者利益的政权。要使这个政权永远不改变颜色，就必须按照列宁所教导的：“使政权完全地、整个地、绝对地掌握在劳动的人，靠劳动为生的人的手里。”列宁、斯大林缔造的第一个社会主义国家，被赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了领导权，是一个沉痛的历史教训。
    因此，我们无产阶级教育的根本目的，集中到一点，就是培养和造就千百万无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的普通劳动者，巩固和加强无产阶级专政。
    相反的，历来一切剥削阶级都把教育作为他们传宗接代的工具。“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”，正是这种教育所奉行的宗旨。一小撮高踞于劳动者头上的精神贵族，便是这种教育的必然产物。
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙，为了实现其篡党篡国、复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，就肆无忌惮地反对毛主席的培养普通劳动者的光辉指示，疯狂地叫嚷：“我们的目标应该培养到能当干部，当技术员，当工程师的水平”，“学好一门专长，将来会成名成家”。这位“大人物”有时也说什么下乡下厂，但是，他宣扬“种几年地，做几年工”，也是为了实现当“家”的“理想”，“做党、政、工、团的领导人”。他为知识青年设计了一幅“回乡升官图”，即通过“会种地”、“有文化”、“跟群众关系搞得好”，“就能当乡、县、省干部，也可以到中央”。他让青年争取“把你的经验向全国推广，这样，你的伟大理想也实现了”，争取“将来写历史的时候，写上你一个名字，个人名利莫过于这个吧”。如此这般，“就有了一切”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫竭力用腐朽透顶的资产阶级世界观毒害青年，诱骗青年通过个人奋斗的道路，“顽强努力”地“往上爬”，达到“成名成家”、“升官发财”的目的。这正淋漓尽致地暴露了他要培养“精神贵族”的罪恶用心。
    无产阶级文化大革命粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的痴心梦想。这个可耻的叛徒妄图培养“精神贵族”的诡计也随之破产。在一片胜利的凯歌声中，高等学校和中等学校的红卫兵小将和广大知识青年，正积极地响应以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号召，面向农村，面向边疆，面向工矿，面向基层，奔赴祖国最需要的地方去。这是革命改变了人的精神面貌所带来的崭新气象。
    到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，到阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的第一线去，在工农群众的大熔炉中锻炼成长，这是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的需要，也是培养知识青年成为普通劳动者的必由之路。这是胜利地贯彻和执行毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人这一伟大战略方针的根本途径。
    在当前毕业分配工作中，仍然存在着走普通劳动者的道路，还是走“精神贵族”的道路的激烈斗争，它集中地表现在坚持“四个面向”还是反对“四个面向”这个问题上。这是毛主席无产阶级教育路线同中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线长期斗争的继续。我们同自己头脑里存在着的贪图安逸、唯恐“屈才”、留恋城市等错误思想作斗争，就是同中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒作斗争。我们必须进一步活学活用毛泽东思想，持久深入地开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线批深批透，彻底清除它的流毒。
    方向已经指明，道路无比宽广。革命的知识青年同志们，祖国在召唤，革命在召唤，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继承和发扬革命先辈的光荣传统，到祖国最需要、最艰苦的地方去，永远做一个全心全意为人民服务的普通劳动者，永远做一个自觉地捍卫毛主席革命路线的无产阶级战士！
