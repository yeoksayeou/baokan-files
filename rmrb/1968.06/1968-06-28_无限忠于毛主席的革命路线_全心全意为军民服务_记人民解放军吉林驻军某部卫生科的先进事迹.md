The medical section of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Jilin has, in the struggle between the two lines, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's series of important instructions on medical work. They are praised by the military and civilians as the "medical section that emphasizes proletarian politics" and the "medical section that loves the people." They have consecutively won the Four Good titles for six years.

Firmly Implementing Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line, the Direction of Serving the Military and Civilians is Correct

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct political and military lines are not produced and developed naturally and peacefully, but are produced and developed through struggle." The comrades of the medical section of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Jilin, in the process of implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to engage in unyielding struggles against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line on the medical and health front pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev, and against the bourgeois military line pushed by the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. They have always advanced along the direction of "serving the entire military and civilians" as indicated by Chairman Mao.

The predecessor of this medical section was the regiment's rescue station. During the war years, the comrades followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "saving the dying and aiding the wounded, practicing revolutionary humanitarianism," and from the director to the medical personnel, they all went to the front lines where the bullets were flying, risking their lives to rescue their comrades. After the national liberation, especially since Comrade Lin Biao took charge of the Military Commission, they have resolutely responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to emphasize proletarian politics, insist on the Four Firsts, vigorously carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and carry out ideological revolutionization. In the Four Good movement, they have rapidly grown. They have followed Chairman Mao's teachings, frequently gone deep into the regiments, deep into the villages and towns, and served the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Just as the comrades of the medical section were advancing along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing brazenly pushed the bourgeois military line, advocating that the military medical department should engage in some "regular construction," "professional proficiency," and "elite" training, etc., attempting to lead the military medical and health cause astray.

Comrade Lin Biao issued instructions to the entire army on emphasizing proletarian politics. This instruction ignited a fire of criticism against Luo Ruiqing's reactionary fallacies in the medical section. The party branch of the medical section immediately organized all the comrades in the section to study Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, and at the same time led everyone to review the resolutions of the Gutian Conference and the expanded meeting of the Military Commission. They used Chairman Mao's teachings as a weapon and discussed the topic of "whether serving the soldiers primarily relies on proletarian politics or on technology?" and "what kind of medical section should be built?" They held a great discussion. Through reviewing the history of the struggle between the two lines of building the army and the history of the section's growth under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they clearly recognized that Chairman Mao's line of building the army is a line of primarily and emphatically building the army politically, a line that guides our army to be extremely proletarianized and to march towards victory. They used the vivid examples of advanced individuals in the section who were armed with Mao Zedong Thought and served the military and civilians wholeheartedly during the war years and in the Four Good movement to severely criticize Luo Ruiqing's fallacies of "regular construction," "professional proficiency," etc. A large number of facts showed that serving the soldiers primarily relies on emphasizing proletarian politics and on Mao Zedong Thought. After this great discussion, Chairman Mao's line of building the army took deeper root in the minds of all the comrades in the section. They decided to forever walk the path of emphasizing proletarian politics and build the medical section into one that is unswervingly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The road ahead is not smooth. Just as the comrades of the medical section were advancing along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with high spirits and victory in sight, the fallacies of "politics and business taking turns to be emphasized" spread by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing blew into the medical section. Faced with this evil wind, the party branch of the medical section mobilized all the comrades in the section to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and the five principles of Comrade Lin Biao's emphasis on proletarian politics as a basis, combined with the section's and personal experiences, and carried out another great criticism of the fallacies of "politics and business taking turns to be emphasized." They said: The essence of "taking turns to be emphasized" is to not emphasize proletarian politics at all. We have decided to walk the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, and we will not waver even if the sky falls! Whoever tries to pull us off the track of emphasizing proletarian politics, even if he is the Jade Emperor, we will fight to the end! The comrades of the medical section not only carried out a thorough criticism of the fallacies of "taking turns to be emphasized," but also, with actual actions of emphasizing proletarian politics, strongly countered the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing. That year, they learned from and applied the experience of the small rectification of the Red Ninth Company, continuously carried out six small rectifications, and further launched a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao said: "It is either the east wind prevailing over the west wind, or the west wind prevailing over the east wind. There is no room for compromise on the issue of line." Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the comrades of the medical section, in their uncompromising struggle against the bourgeois military line and the revisionist line on the medical and health front pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev, greatly raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. They said: Having a heart that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao and having awareness of the struggle between the two lines, our direction of serving the military and civilians will never change.

Unswervingly Loyal to Chairman Mao, Deeply Serving Class Brothers

The great leader Chairman Mao instructs us: "Shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, the comrades of the medical section severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line on the medical and health front pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev, and established in their minds the idea of wholeheartedly serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. While doing a good job of medical and health work in the regiments, they sent a large number of personnel to the countryside to serve the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

The party branch frequently conducted class education for all the comrades in the section, continuously raising their proletarian consciousness. The party branch organized everyone to visit the poor in the countryside, invited old poor peasants who had deep hatred for the old society to tell their family and village histories, and invited poor and lower-middle peasants to talk about the pain they suffered from the persecution of the revisionist medical and health line of the Chinese Khrushchev. This aroused the comrades' deep hatred for the old society and the Chinese Khrushchev, and cultivated their deep proletarian feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The comrades of the medical section frequently studied Chairman Mao's teachings of "the people, and only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history" and "the main force that has been fighting and struggling in the countryside is the poor peasants," and displayed the merits of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the revolution, raising their awareness of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The comrades of the medical section, with deep proletarian feelings, served the poor and lower-middle peasants. They did not mind the high mountains and long roads, did not care about the wind and rain, did not distinguish between day and night, and even in the dead of night when the snow blocked the door, they would still go to the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants to provide medical treatment and medicine. The section also specially set up a "love-the-people clinic" to treat the masses. They said: "Our door is open to the poor and lower-middle peasants."

In the process of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants, the comrades of the medical section were deeply educated by the poor and lower-middle peasants' lofty qualities of loving the great leader Chairman Mao. An old peasant named Kong, 73 years old, was burned in an accident. The medical section brought him in for treatment. Old Kong's injuries were severe, but he insisted on studying the "Three Articles" and reciting Chairman Mao's quotations every day while lying in bed. As soon as he could move a little, he would go to Chairman Mao's statue every morning to wish Chairman Mao longevity. The poor and lower-middle peasants' deep love for Chairman Mao aroused the comrades' deep feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants. They said: "The poor and lower-middle peasants love Chairman Mao the most, and we must wholeheartedly serve the people who love Chairman Mao the most." They overcame the difficulty of lacking experience in treating burns and, after more than a month of effort, finally cured this old peasant.

"There is no love or hatred without a reason in the world." If you are a proletarian medical worker, you love the proletariat and the poor and lower-middle peasants; serving the poor and lower-middle peasants means not fearing dirt, not fearing hard work, not fearing hardship, and not fearing death. When the child of a poor peasant named Li Qing fell seriously ill, the medical worker Luo Xiujin rushed over to treat him. He found that the child's condition was serious and that the trachea was blocked by phlegm, making the child's life extremely dangerous. But there was no suction device. What to do? Should he use his mouth to suck? This disease is highly contagious, and using the mouth to suck has a high risk. Luo Xiujin thought, now is the time when the poor and lower-middle peasants need him, and even if he is infected and sacrifices his life, he must save the offspring of the poor and lower-middle peasants. This medical worker, who had only received three months of training, relying on a heart that is unswervingly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and proletarian feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants, did not hesitate to use his mouth to suck out the phlegm and saved the child from the brink of death.

Believing in and Relying on the Masses, Serving the Military and Civilians Has a Backing

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must tell the people to rise up and fight against their own illiteracy, superstitions, and unhealthy habits." The comrades of the medical section, when going deep into the countryside and towns to serve the broad masses of workers and peasants, followed Chairman Mao's teachings, believed in the masses, relied on the masses, and mobilized the masses to carry out health work, making the medical and health cause better serve "the entire military and civilians."

The comrades of the medical section regarded carrying out mass health work as a political battle. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The autocrats benefit from the people's ignorance, while we benefit from the people's enlightenment. We want all the people to gradually leave the state of ignorance and unhealthy habits." The comrades of the medical section learned from Chairman Mao's teachings and realized that the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the health department crazily pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and opposed carrying out mass health movements precisely because they wanted to keep the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in a state of ignorance and unhealthy habits, so as to facilitate their conspiracy to restore capitalism. The comrades of the medical section said that whether or not to carry out mass health work is a struggle over whether or not to fundamentally change the people's spiritual outlook, a struggle over which class, which road, and which line will win. Therefore, wherever they went, they vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, implemented Chairman Mao's great instructions on health work, and carried out mass health work. Over the years, whether they went with the troops to the countryside for field training or worked and built with the soldiers, they vigorously assisted the local areas in mobilizing the masses to carry out the patriotic health campaign. Since 1962, they have successively carried out "health villages" activities in more than 800 villages and towns. This mass patriotic health movement not only improved the environment, enhanced the health of the masses, and promoted production, but also changed people's spiritual outlook. In these villages and towns, Chairman Mao's call to "mobilize the people, pay attention to hygiene, reduce diseases, and improve health levels" has been deeply ingrained in people's hearts.

The comrades of the medical section always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings of "the masses are the real heroes" and relied on the masses at all times. Last spring, just as the countryside was launching a high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production, a disease broke out in a production team. The three military doctors from the epidemic prevention station of the medical section, Tang Chuanfeng and others, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. They first propagated Chairman Mao's relevant teachings to the masses, enhancing the masses' courage and confidence in eliminating the disease. There were few medical personnel, so they organized the masses to take care of themselves; there were few medicines, so they mobilized the masses to offer suggestions. In this way, relying on the strength of the masses, they effectively stopped the spread of the disease and ensured the smooth progress of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

To facilitate the carrying out of mass health work, the medical section widely set up training classes in the countryside and cities to train non-full-time medical workers for the local areas. Since 1964, they have successively helped the local areas train more than 8,900 non-full-time medical workers. To change the situation of a lack of doctors and medicines in the vast rural areas and to build a proletarian health work team in the countryside, they have made new contributions.

In the practical struggle of serving the military and civilians, the comrades of the medical section deeply felt that the masses are the objects of medical and health service and are also the reliable backing for revolutionary medical workers to serve the people. Only by relying on the masses can one better serve the masses.

Fighting Against "Selfishness," Serving the Military and Civilians Without Wavering

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism."

The party branch of the medical section, to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and completely and thoroughly serve the soldiers and the broad masses of workers and peasants, while leading all the comrades in the section to continuously struggle against the bourgeois military line and the revisionist line on the medical and health front pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev, also guided all the comrades to continuously struggle against the "selfishness" in their own minds and establish a worldview of completely and thoroughly serving the people.

The comrades of the medical section, in the process of continuously and massively criticizing and transforming themselves, used Chairman Mao's great work "Three Articles" as a motto, and whenever they encountered problems, they would look at how Chairman Mao taught, how Norman Bethune did, and how they themselves thought. Wherever there were patients, wherever the conditions were the most difficult, and wherever the class struggle was the most intense, they would set up the battlefield of criticizing and transforming themselves. During the spring festival holiday this year, the medical worker Luo Xiujin fell ill in a peasant's home. Suddenly, he heard a peasant report that the class enemy was inciting the peasants in a nearby production team to seek divine medicine to cure diseases. Luo Xiujin heard this and quickly got up, wanting to go to that production team. He had just gotten off the kang, and suddenly felt his eyes flashing with gold and his body weak. To go or not to go? A struggle between public and private interests unfolded in his mind: If he went, he would not only treat the peasants' illnesses but also mobilize the masses to smash the class enemy's sabotage plots and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. But if he went, his body might not hold up. At this time, he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings of "to die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai" and of Norman Bethune's heroic deeds on the anti-Japanese front, and suddenly gained boundless strength. He gritted his teeth and insisted on going to that production team, treating patients while propagating Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions, exposing the class enemy's plots, and organizing everyone to criticize the heinous crimes committed by the Chinese Khrushchev. He treated one family, lectured one family, treated one village, lectured one village, serving the poor and lower-middle peasants with deep proletarian feelings and fighting against the class enemy with deep hatred. In this way, during the spring festival holiday, he treated more than 160 poor and lower-middle peasants and also helped the masses completely smash the class enemy's sabotage plots. The peasants said: "We do not believe in heaven, we do not believe in gods, we only believe in the good doctors sent by Chairman Mao." Luo Xiujin won another victory in the struggle between public and private interests.

The comrades of the medical section, from the height of the struggle between the two lines, criticized and transformed themselves, and from criticizing and transforming themselves, solved the problems in their minds that arose in the struggle between the two lines. The awareness of the struggle between the two lines was universally raised, and the comrades loved Chairman Mao more, more faithfully implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and more firmly advanced along the direction of "serving the entire military and civilians" indicated by Chairman Mao.

    无限忠于毛主席的革命路线　全心全意为军民服务
    ——记人民解放军吉林驻军某部卫生科的先进事迹
    人民解放军吉林驻军某部卫生科在两条路线斗争中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定地站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决贯彻执行毛主席对卫生工作的一系列重要指示，被军民誉为“突出无产阶级政治的卫生科”、“爱民卫生科”。连续六年荣获四好称号。
    坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，为军民服务方向正
    毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”人民解放军吉林驻军某部卫生科的同志在贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的过程中，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，同中国赫鲁晓夫在医疗卫生战线上推行的反革命修正主义路线，同反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行的资产阶级军事路线，进行了不屈不挠的斗争，使自己始终沿着毛主席指引的“为全体军民服务”的方向前进。
    这个卫生科的前身是师救护所。在战争年代里，同志们遵循毛主席“救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义”的教导，从所长到卫生员，都到战火纷飞的前线，出生入死地抢救战友。全国解放以后，特别是自从林彪副主席主持军委工作以来，他们坚决响应林副主席的号召，大力突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大力开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，大搞思想革命化，在四好运动中迅速成长。他们遵照毛主席的教导，经常深入连队，深入农村、集镇，为广大工农兵服务。
    正当卫生科的同志沿着毛主席的革命路线前进的时候，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿猖狂推行资产阶级军事路线，鼓吹部队卫生部门要搞什么“正规建设”、“业务过硬”、“尖子”训练等等，妄图把部队医疗卫生事业引上邪路。
    林副主席向全军发出了关于突出无产阶级政治的指示。这个指示，在卫生科里点燃了批判罗瑞卿的反动谬论的烈火。卫生科党支部马上组织全科同志学习林副主席的指示，同时领导大家重温古田会议决议及军委扩大会议决议。他们以毛主席的教导为武器，以“为兵服务首先是靠无产阶级政治还是靠技术？”“应该建成什么样的卫生科？”为题，展开了一场大讨论。大家通过回顾我军两条建军路线的斗争史，回顾本科在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下的成长史，清楚地认识到：毛主席的建军路线，是首先和着重从政治上建军的路线，是指引我军非常无产阶级化、永远走向胜利的唯一正确的路线。他们用本科在战争年代和在四好运动中出现的用毛泽东思想武装起来的先进人物全心全意为军民服务的生动事例，狠批了罗瑞卿的“正规建设”、
  “业务过硬”等等谬论。大量的事实说明：为兵服务，首先要靠突出无产阶级政治，靠毛泽东思想。经过这次大讨论，毛主席的建军路线在全科同志的头脑中扎根更深了，他们决心永远走突出无产阶级政治的路，把卫生科建成无限忠于毛主席革命路线的卫生科。
    前进的道路是不平坦的。正当卫生科的同志沿着毛主席的革命路线意气风发、胜利前进的时候，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿散布的政治和业务“轮流突出”的谬论又吹到卫生科。在这一股歪风面前，卫生科党支部发动全科同志，以毛泽东思想为武器，以林副主席突出无产阶级政治的五项原则为依据，结合科里和个人的切身体会，又对政治和业务“轮流突出”的谬论进行了一场大批判。他们说：“轮流突出”的实质就是不要突出无产阶级政治这个根本。我们走突出无产阶级政治的路，是走定了，天塌地陷不动摇！谁想把我们拉下突出无产阶级政治的轨道，他就是天王老子，我们也要和他拚到底！卫生科的同志不但对“轮流突出”的谬论进行了彻底的批判，而且以突出无产阶级政治的实际行动，狠狠地反击反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿。这一年，他们学习和运用红九连小整风的经验，连续开展了六次小整风，进一步掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮。
    毛主席说：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”卫生科的同志在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在同资产阶级军事路线和中国赫鲁晓夫在医疗卫生战线上推行的修正主义路线进行不调和的斗争中，大大提高了两条路线斗争觉悟。他们说：有一颗永远忠于毛主席的红心，有了两条路线斗争觉悟，我们为军民服务的方向就永远不会变。
    无限忠于毛主席，
      为阶级兄弟服务感情深
    伟大领袖毛主席指示我们：“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”。遵照毛主席的教导，卫生科的同志狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在医疗卫生战线上推行的反革命修正主义路线，在自己的头脑中树立全心全意为贫下中农服务的思想。他们在作好连队医疗卫生工作的同时，抽出大批人员到农村为广大贫下中农服务。
    党支部经常对全科同志进行阶级教育，不断提高全科同志的无产阶级觉悟。党支部组织大家在农村访贫问苦，请在旧社会苦大仇深的老贫农讲家史、村史，请贫下中农讲遭受中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义医疗卫生路线迫害的痛苦，激发了全科同志对旧社会和中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨，培育了对贫下中农的深厚的无产阶级感情。
    卫生科的同志经常学习毛主席“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”和“乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农”的教导，大摆贫下中农为革命建立的功绩，提高了自己为贫下中农服务的自觉性。
    卫生科的同志怀着深厚的无产阶级感情为贫下中农服务。他们不顾山高路远，不管风里雨里，不分白天夜晚，就是在大雪封门的深夜，也要送医送药到贫下中农家里。科里还专门开办了“爱民诊所”，为群众看病。他们说：“我们的大门是朝着贫下中农开的。”
    在为贫下中农服务的过程中，贫下中农热爱伟大领袖毛主席的崇高品质，使卫生科的同志深深地受到教育。有位七十三岁的贫农孔老大爷，因公烧伤，卫生科把他接来治疗。孔大爷伤势很重，但他躺在病床上还坚持天天学习“老三篇”，背诵毛主席语录。当他稍微能活动了，就每天早晨忍着剧痛走到毛主席的塑像前，祝福毛主席万寿无疆。贫下中农对毛主席的无限热爱，激起了卫生科的同志对贫下中农的深厚感情。大家说：“贫下中农最热爱毛主席，我们就是要勤勤恳恳、全心全意地为最热爱毛主席的人服务。”他们克服了缺乏治疗烧伤经验的困难，经过一个多月的努力，终于把这位贫农老大爷的伤治好了。
      “世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”你是无产阶级的卫生工作者，你就爱无产阶级，爱贫下中农；为贫下中农服务就不怕脏、不怕累、不怕苦、不怕死。贫农社员李清的孩子得了急病，卫生员罗秀金急忙赶去治疗。他发现孩子的病情严重，而且气管被痰堵住了，生命十分危急。可是没有吸痰器，怎么办？用嘴吸吗？这种病传染性很强，用嘴吸有很大的危险性。罗秀金想，现在正是贫下中农需要自己的时候，就是被传染了，就是牺牲了自己的生命，也要抢救这个贫下中农的后代。这个只受过三个月训练的卫生员，就凭着一颗无限忠于毛主席革命路线的红心，凭着热爱贫下中农的无产阶级感情，毫不犹豫地口对口把痰吸了出来，把孩子从死亡线上救了回来。
    相信和依靠群众，
      为军民服务有靠山
    毛主席教导我们：“我们必须告诉群众，自己起来同自己的文盲、迷信和不卫生的习惯作斗争。”卫生科的同志在深入农村、集镇为广大工农服务的时候，遵照毛主席这一教导，处处相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众来开展卫生工作，使医疗卫生事业更好地“为全体军民服务”。
    卫生科的同志把开展群众性的卫生工作，是当作一场政治仗来打的。毛主席教导我们：“专制主义者利于人民愚昧，我们则利于人民聪明，我们要使一切人民都能逐渐地离开愚昧状态与不卫生的状态。”卫生科的同志学习了毛主席的教导，认识到：中国赫鲁晓夫及其在卫生部门的代理人，之所以疯狂推行反革命修正主义路线，之所以反对开展群众性的卫生运动，就是妄图使广大贫下中农处于不卫生状态和愚昧状态，以便于他们阴谋复辟资本主义。卫生科的同志说，要不要开展群众性的卫生工作，这是一场关系到要不要彻底改变人民的精神面貌的斗争，是一场关系到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线谁胜谁负的斗争。因此，他们走到哪里，就大力宣传毛主席的革命路线，落实毛主席有关卫生工作的伟大指示，开展群众性的卫生工作。几年来，他们不管是随部队到农村野营，还是和战士一起生产、施工，都大力协助地方发动群众，开展爱国卫生运动。一九六二年以来，他们先后在八百多个村镇开展了“卫生村”的活动。这个群众性的爱国卫生运动，不仅改造了环境，增强了群众的健康，促进了生产，同时也改变了人的精神面貌。在这些村镇，毛主席的
  “动员起来，讲究卫生，减少疾病，提高健康水平”的伟大号召，更加深入人心。
    卫生科的同志，牢记毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，时时处处依靠群众。去年春天，正当农村掀起抓革命、促生产的高潮的时候，一种疾病在一个生产队发生了。卫生科防疫所军医唐传炯等三人闻讯火速赶到。他们首先向群众宣传毛主席的有关教导，使群众增强消灭疾病的勇气和信心。医务人员少，他们就把群众组织起来自行护理；药品少，他们就发动群众献计献策。就这样，依靠群众的力量有效地制止了疾病的流行，保证了抓革命、促生产的顺利进行。
    为了有利于开展群众性的卫生工作，卫生科在农村、城镇广泛开办为地方培训不脱产的卫生员的学习班。一九六四年以来，先后帮助地方培训了八千九百多名不脱产的卫生员。为改变广大农村缺医少药的状况，为在农村建立无产阶级的卫生工作队伍作出了新的贡献。
    卫生科的同志在为军民服务的斗争实践中，深深体会到：群众是医疗卫生工作服务的对象，也是广大革命医务工作者为人民服务的靠山。只有依靠群众，才能更好地为群众服务。
    狠斗“私”字，
      为军民服务不转向
    毛主席教导我们：“要斗私，批修。”
    卫生科党支部为了坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，完全彻底地为士兵和广大工农群众服务，在领导全科同志不断地同资产阶级军事路线、同中国赫鲁晓夫在医疗卫生战线上推行的修正主义路线作斗争的同时，也引导全体同志不断地同自己头脑中的“私”字作斗争，树立“完全”
  “彻底”为人民服务的世界观。
    卫生科的同志在经常性、群众性的破私立公过程中，以毛主席的伟大著作“老三篇”为座右铭，每遇到问题就看看毛主席是怎样教导的，白求恩是怎么做的，自己是怎么想的。哪里有病人，哪里条件最艰苦，哪里阶级斗争最激烈，他们就在哪里摆开破私立公的战场。今年春节放假期间，卫生员罗秀金病倒在一个社员家里，突然听到社员报告，阶级敌人在邻近一个生产队煽动农民求神赐药治病。罗秀金一听急忙翻身起来，要赶到那个生产队去。他刚下炕，只觉得两眼直冒金花，浑身无力。去，还是不去？在他思想里展开了一场公与私的斗争：去了，不仅给社员看了病，更重要的是发动群众粉碎阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，捍卫毛主席的革命路线。可是去了身体支持不住怎么办？这时，他想起毛主席的“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”的教导，想起了白求恩在抗日前线的英雄行为，顿时增添了无穷的力量，他咬紧牙关坚持到了这个生产队，一边给病人看病，一边宣传毛主席的光辉指示，揭露阶级敌人的阴谋，组织大家批判中国赫鲁晓夫犯下的滔天罪行。他看一家，讲一家，看一村，讲一村，以无限深厚的无产阶级感情为贫下中农服务，以无比仇恨与阶级敌人作斗争，就这样，在春节假期内，他为贫下中农看病一百六十多人次，还帮助群众彻底粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。社员们说：“不信天，不信神，就信咱毛主席派来的好医生。”罗秀金在公与私的斗争面前，又打了一次胜仗。
    卫生科的同志从两条路线斗争的高度上破私立公，从破私立公入手，解决自己思想上在两条路线斗争中发生的问题，两条路线斗争觉悟有了普遍提高，同志们更加热爱毛主席，更加忠实执行毛主席的革命路线，更加坚定地沿着毛主席指引的“为全体军民服务”的方向阔步前进。
