The Israeli aggressors have recently launched new military provocations against the United Arab Republic, Jordan, and Lebanon. This is the result of the U.S. imperialists, with the support of their number one accomplice, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, shielding and encouraging their tool of aggression, Israel. The facts of the past year since the large-scale aggression launched by Israel against the Arab countries on June 5, 1967, fully illustrate this point.

The aggression last June was launched by the U.S. to suppress the surging anti-U.S. storm in the Middle East in order to maintain its strategic position and huge oil interests in the region. Before launching the war of aggression, the U.S. had supplied Israel with over 400 new tanks and more than 200 military aircraft, and sent more than a thousand U.S. Air Force "volunteers." Faced with the U.S.-Israeli war provocations, the Arab countries took self-defense measures. Syria closed down the U.S. espionage organization, the "American Friends of the Middle East," in Syria in early May. The United Arab Republic then demanded the withdrawal of the U.S. tool of aggression, the "United Nations Emergency Force," from its territory and the Gaza Strip, and declared a blockade of the southern end of the Gulf of Aqaba in the Sinai Peninsula.

Under these circumstances, U.S. imperialism instigated Israel to speed up its war preparations. After the Israeli Foreign Minister Eban went to Washington for "urgent consultations" at the end of May, Israel immediately formed a "war cabinet" on June 1 and appointed Dayan, the Israeli army chief of staff during the 1956 Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, as the defense minister. On June 4, the Israeli ambassador to Washington hurriedly returned to Israel with Johnson's secret instructions to participate in the emergency cabinet meeting to launch the war. At the same time, the U.S. Sixth Fleet and the British Navy were concentrated in the eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea, and the U.S. and Britain rushed military equipment and ammunition to Israel. The U.S. U-2 spy planes were ordered to conduct reconnaissance for Israel's aggression, and the commander of the "U.S. Strike Command," Theodore Conway, personally went to a U.S. air base in North Africa to deploy the armed invasion.

After all the preparations were in place, the U.S.-Israeli aggressors launched a large-scale air and ground attack on the Arab countries on June 5, imitating Hitler's "blitzkrieg," seizing the Gaza Strip, the West Bank of the Jordan River, and large tracts of Arab land, including the Sinai Peninsula of the United Arab Republic and the Golan Heights of Syria.

The U.S. imperialists launched this war of aggression against the Arab countries with the support and help of the Soviet revisionist clique. Before the war broke out, Moscow had frequent exchanges of telegrams with Washington and London, and special envoys came and went. The Soviet revisionist clique repeatedly revealed its bottom line to the U.S., indicating its desire to "avoid a U.S.-Soviet conflict in the Middle East." The Soviet revisionist clique also catered to the needs of the U.S., doing its utmost to deceive the Arab countries, saying that Israel would not "attack" and that the Arab countries should "restrain" themselves, be "cautious," and "avoid a major confrontation," not allowing the Arab countries to take military self-defense actions. On May 26, Johnson sent a telegram to President Nasser of the United Arab Republic, threatening that the United Arab Republic must "stop any military actions that could lead to a large-scale offensive war." The next day, early in the morning, Kosygin also urgently met with Nasser through the Soviet ambassador, expressing the Soviet government's insistence that the United Arab Republic "not fire the first shot." The Soviet revisionists' actions supported and helped the U.S. decide to fight a "quick war." The Associated Press later said that the U.S. instigated Israel to launch the aggression at this time because it was convinced through secret talks and other channels that the Soviet Union would not support the Arab countries in their counterattack.

On June 5, while the aircraft on the aircraft carrier of the U.S. Sixth Fleet were covering Israel's air defense, and hundreds of Israeli aircraft, with the participation of U.S. and British planes, took turns to fiercely bomb the air bases and airports of the United Arab Republic, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq, Kosygin sent a telegram to Johnson through the "hotline," expressing that the Soviet revisionists would not interfere with the U.S.'s armed aggression, saying that the Soviet Union "does not want a war with the U.S. in the Middle East," shamelessly allowing the U.S. to do as it pleased. This traitor, who always flew the flag of supporting the Arab countries and claimed that it would not stand idly by when the Arab countries were invaded, once again betrayed the Arab people at the moment when they were suddenly attacked and in difficulty. After this, the U.S. and Soviet representatives in the United Nations, through tense backroom deals, jointly concocted resolutions such as "immediate ceasefire" and "ceasefire within a time limit" in the Security Council, forcing Jordan, the United Arab Republic, and Syria to accept unconditional "ceasefires" after losing large tracts of land. The Soviet revisionists' various acts of betrayal made the Arab people see more clearly that the Soviet revisionists are the U.S.'s number one accomplice and further understand the necessity of opposing imperialism and revisionism. Anti-U.S. and anti-Soviet demonstrations unprecedented in scale broke out all over the Arab world, with tens of thousands of people taking to the streets, shouting slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Hang Johnson!" "The Soviet revisionists are traitors!" "Kosygin, go to the garbage dump!" and so on.

After the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists forced the Arab countries to accept the "ceasefire," they then jointly plotted the political trap of a "political solution" to the Middle East issue, attempting to induce the Arab countries to surrender completely to the U.S.-Israeli aggressors. On June 16, Kosygin, under the pretext of attending an emergency United Nations meeting to discuss the Middle East issue, personally went to the U.S. to call on Johnson, and on June 23 and 25, held secret talks with Johnson in Glassboro, reaching a secret agreement on the Middle East issue behind the backs of the Arab countries. On November 22, the U.S. and the Soviet Union again manipulated the United Nations Security Council to pass a proposal in substance fully in line with the Glassboro secret agreement, forcing the Arab countries to surrender completely. The "British proposal."

From the end of June 1967, when the Glassboro secret agreement was reached, to November 22, when the United Nations Security Council passed the "British proposal," the U.S. and the Soviet Union, on the one hand, conducted tense backroom deals in the United Nations, and on the other, instructed their double-faced lackeys Tito, Indira Gandhi, and others to go to the Arab countries to lobby, inducing the Arab countries to accept the humiliating conditions.

After the United Nations Security Council passed the "British proposal," in mid-December, it sent "special envoy" Jarring to the Middle East to peddle the black goods jointly concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union. To coordinate with Jarring's "mission" in the Middle East, U.S. imperialism exerted pressure on the Arab countries and instigated Israel to repeatedly carry out military provocations and aggression against the Arab countries. Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol arrogantly declared that he was prepared to "fight a twenty-year war" with the Arab countries. On March 21 of this year, Israel launched an attack on Jordan, mobilizing 15,000 invading troops in one go. Soon after Israel launched a large-scale military attack on Jordan, TASS came out and greatly praised Jarring's activities, saying that they had "found a shortcut to a political solution to the conflict." During this period, the Soviet revisionist leadership sent high-level government representatives and officials to the Middle East for frequent activities, continuing to peddle the "political solution" fraud, and had issued a joint statement with British Prime Minister Wilson in Moscow in January of this year, expressing support for Jarring's activities.

However, the U.S. and Soviet revisionists' surrender trap encountered strong opposition from Syria and other Arab countries and peoples from the outset. On November 19 of last year, the Syrian cabinet held a meeting, expressing its rejection of the proposal on the Middle East issue put forward by U.S. and British imperialism in the United Nations Security Council. On the 23rd, the Syrian government spokesman pointed out that the proposal passed by the United Nations Security Council made aggression and expansion legal internationally and turned Arab territory into a place for international transactions. Damascus, the capital of Syria, and Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, held mass demonstrations in succession, expressing their firm rejection of the so-called "political solution" trap on the Palestinian issue.

For the six months since mid-December of last year, after being snubbed in Syria, the United Nations "special envoy" Jarring continued to shuttle between Tel Aviv, Cairo, Amman, and Beirut. According to Western news agencies, after the plot to bring the Arab countries and Israel "face to face" for talks failed, Jarring, under the instructions of the U.S., proposed the so-called plan for Israel to hold "indirect talks" with the Arab countries.

Recently, "Fatah" (Palestine Liberation Movement) has repeatedly pointed out: "We reject all United Nations resolutions on the Palestinian issue." On May 29, "Fatah" spokesman Yasir Arafat, speaking about the United Nations "special envoy" Jarring's activities in the Middle East to concoct a "political solution," pointed out: "We do not know Jarring, nor do we recognize those behind Jarring and the agreements they concocted. We only know the interests of Palestine and only recognize the will of the Palestinian people."

    美帝是阿拉伯人民的死敌　苏修是美帝的头号帮凶
    以色列侵略者连日来又向阿联、约旦和黎巴嫩等阿拉伯国家发动新的军事挑衅。这是美帝国主义在它的头号帮凶苏修叛徒集团支持下，对美帝侵略工具以色列进行包庇纵容的结果。从去年六月五日以色列对阿拉伯国家发动大规模侵略战争以后一年来的事实，充分说明了这一点。
    去年六月的侵略战争，是美帝为了镇压中东地区日益高涨的反美风暴以保持其在中东的战略地位和巨大的石油利益而发动的。在发动侵略战争以前，美帝就向以色列提供了四百多辆新式坦克和二百多架军用飞机，派去上千名美国空军“志愿人员”。面对美以的战争挑衅，阿拉伯国家采取了自卫措施。叙利亚于五月初封闭了美国在叙利亚的间谍机构——“美国中东之友协会”。接着，阿联要求美帝侵略工具“联合国紧急部队”撤出阿联领土和加沙地带，并宣布封锁西奈半岛南端的亚喀巴湾。
    在这种情况下，美帝国主义就策动以色列加紧战争部署。在五月底以色列外交部长埃班前往华盛顿“进行紧急磋商”后，以色列即在六月一日组成了“战争内阁”，并起用一九五六年英、法、以侵略埃及时的以军总司令达扬为国防部长。六月四日，以色列驻华盛顿大使带着约翰逊的秘密指示，匆匆赶回以色列，参加了发动战争的紧急内阁会议。与此同时，美国第六舰队和英国海军向东地中海和红海地区集结，美英向以色列紧急空运军事装备和弹药，美国U—2间谍飞机奉命为以色列发动侵略进行侦察，“美国进击司令部”总司令西奥多·康韦还亲自赶到北非的美国的一个空军基地部署武装侵略。
    在一切部署停当以后，美以侵略军即在六月五日抄袭希特勒的“闪电战”，向阿拉伯国家发动大规模的空中和地面进攻，侵占了加沙地带、约旦河西岸和阿联的西奈半岛和叙利亚的戈兰高地等大片阿拉伯土地。
    美帝国主义对阿拉伯国家的这场侵略战争，是在苏修集团的支持和帮助下发动的。在战争爆发以前，莫斯科同华盛顿、伦敦之间函电往来频繁，特使络绎不绝。苏修集团一再向美帝交底，表明它有力求“避免美苏在中东发生冲突”的愿望。苏修集团还迎合美帝的需要，竭力欺骗阿拉伯国家，说什么以色列不会“进攻”，要阿拉伯国家“克制”、“谨慎”，“避免一场大的较量”，不许阿拉伯国家采取军事自卫行动。五月二十六日，约翰逊打电报给阿联总统纳赛尔，威胁阿联必须“停止采取任何可能导致大规模战争攻势的军事行动”。第二天凌晨，柯西金也通过苏联大使紧急会见纳赛尔，表示苏联政府坚持要求阿联“不要首先开火”。苏修的这种行为，支持和帮助了美帝下了打一场“速决战”的决心。美国合众国际社在事后说，美国之所以在这个时候策动以色列发动侵略，是“因为它通过秘密会谈和其他渠道”，深信苏联不会支持阿拉伯国家进行反击。
    就在六月五日，正当美国第六舰队航空母舰上的飞机掩护着以色列的空防，几百架以色列飞机在美、英飞机的参与下轮番猛烈轰炸阿联、叙利亚、约旦和伊拉克的空军基地和机场的时候，柯西金却通过“热线”给约翰逊发出电报，表示苏修不干预美帝的这场武装侵略，说什么“苏联不希望同美国在中东发生战争”，无耻地让美帝放手大干。这个一贯打着支持阿拉伯国家旗号，宣称在阿拉伯国家遭受侵略时，不会袖手旁观的大叛徒，在阿拉伯人民遭受突然袭击处于困难的时刻，又一次背信弃义，出卖了阿拉伯人民。在这以后美苏驻联合国代表经过紧张的幕后交易，在安理会上共同炮制出“立即停火”、“限期停火”等决议，迫使约旦、阿联和叙利亚在丧失大片土地的情况下，先后接受无条件“停火”。苏修的种种叛卖行径，使阿拉伯人民进一步看清了苏修是美帝的头号帮凶，进一步懂得了反帝必反修的道理。阿拉伯各地到处爆发了前所未有的反对美帝苏修的示威，成千上万的群众愤怒地走上街头，振臂高呼“打倒美帝！”“绞死约翰逊！”“苏修是叛徒！”“柯西金滚进垃圾堆里去！”等口号。
    美帝苏修串通一气迫使阿拉伯国家接受“停火”以后，接着就共同策划“政治解决”中东问题的政治圈套，企图诱逼阿拉伯国家对美以侵略者全面投降。六月十六日，柯西金以参加联合国紧急会议讨论中东问题为名，亲自去美国登门求见约翰逊，并在六月二十三日和二十五日，在葛拉斯堡罗同约翰逊举行秘密会谈，背着阿拉伯国家就中东问题达成秘密协议。十一月二十二日，美苏又操纵联合国安理会通过了一项在实质上完全符合葛拉斯堡罗秘密协议的、迫使阿拉伯国家全面投降的“英国提案”。
    从去年六月下旬葛拉斯堡罗秘密协议到十一月二十二日联合国安理会通过“英国提案”的五个多月中，美苏一面在联合国进行紧张的幕后交易，一面指使它们的双料走狗铁托、英迪拉·甘地等人，到阿拉伯国家进行游说，诱骗阿拉伯国家接受丧权辱国的条件。
    联合国安理会通过“英国提案”以后，十二月中旬就派“特使”雅林，去中东推销美苏联合炮制的这个黑货。美帝国主义为了配合雅林在中东的“使命”，对阿拉伯国家施加压力，怂恿以色列不断对阿拉伯国家进行军事挑衅和侵略。以色列总理艾希科尔狂妄叫嚷，要准备同阿拉伯国家“打二十年的仗”。今年三月二十一日，以色列对约旦发动的进攻，一次就出动了侵略军一万五千人。就在以色列对约旦进行大规模军事袭击以后不久，塔斯社却跳出来大肆吹捧雅林的活动“找到了政治解决冲突的捷径”。在这期间，苏修领导集团派政府高级代表团、高级官员到中东频繁活动，继续推销“政治解决”骗局，并曾在今年一月同英国首相威尔逊在莫斯科发表联合公报，表示支持雅林的活动。
    但是美帝苏修的诱降骗局，一开始就遭到叙利亚等阿拉伯国家和人民的强烈反对。去年十一月十九日，叙利亚内阁召开会议，表示拒绝美英帝国主义在联合国安理会提出的关于中东问题的提案。二十三日叙利亚政府发言人指出，联合国安理会通过的提案使得侵略和扩张在国际上合法化，使得阿拉伯领土变成国际交易的场所。叙利亚首都大马士革和伊拉克首都巴格达相继举行了群众示威，表示坚决拒绝在巴勒斯坦问题上的所谓“政治解决”的诱降圈套。
    从去年十二月中旬以来的六个月的时间里，联合国“特使”雅林在叙利亚吃了闭门羹之后，继续奔走于特拉维夫、开罗、安曼和贝鲁特之间。据西方通讯社透露，雅林企图拉拢阿拉伯国家同以色列“面对面会谈”的阴谋破产后，又在美帝授意下提出了所谓以色列同阿拉伯国家举行“间接谈判”的方案。
    最近“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦解放运动）一再严正指出：“我们拒绝联合国对巴勒斯坦问题的所有决议。”五月二十九日，“法塔赫”发言人亚西尔·阿拉法特在谈到关于联合国“特使”雅林在中东搞“政治解决”的阴谋活动时指出：“我们既不了解雅林，也不承认那些雅林的幕后人物以及他们炮制的协议。我们只知道巴勒斯坦的利益，只承认巴勒斯坦人民的意愿。”
