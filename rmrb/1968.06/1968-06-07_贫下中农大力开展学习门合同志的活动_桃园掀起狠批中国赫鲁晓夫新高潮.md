Poor and lower-middle peasants in Taoyuan Brigade of Luwangzhuang Commune, Lufeng County, Hebei Province, with the help of a propaganda team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, are vigorously carrying out activities to learn from Comrade Men He. Inspired by Comrade Men He's revolutionary spirit, they are intensifying class struggle and fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionism of the Chinese Khrushchev, pushing the revolutionary criticism movement to develop deeply and persistently.

The poor and lower-middle peasants regard the activities to learn from Comrade Men He as a heavy blow to the Chinese Khrushchev, a great driving force for the revolutionary criticism movement to continue to develop deeply and persistently, an important part of closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further launching the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and an important measure to realize the revolutionization of people's ideology and cultivate successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

In the activities to learn from Comrade Men He, the PLA propaganda team and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants carried out the "five comparisons, five examinations, and five criticisms" activities. That is:

1. Compare Comrade Men He's boundless loyalty to the people, the Party, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, examine one's own loyalty to Chairman Mao, and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crimes of opposing Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

2. Compare Comrade Men He's revolutionary spirit of resolutely executing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, examine one's own execution and defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's evil deeds of obstructing and sabotaging the poor and lower-middle peasants' resolute execution and defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

3. Compare Comrade Men He's eagerness to study Chairman Mao's works and insist on the fine style of studying and applying them, examine one's own study and application, and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party who slander the poor and lower-middle peasants' study of Chairman Mao's works as "simplification," "vulgarization," and "pragmatism."

4. Compare Comrade Men He's communist style of "selflessness and dedication to the people," examine one's own priority of the public interest, and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's theories of "merging public and private interests" and "public interest with private interests."

5. Compare Comrade Men He's close ties with the masses and his persistent maintenance of the laboring people's frugal and plain character, examine one's own mass consciousness, and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line of alienating, suppressing, and striking the masses.

Through the "five comparisons, five examinations, and five criticisms" activities, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were inspired by Comrade Men He's revolutionary spirit and lofty qualities, further aroused their hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line, and loved Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line even more. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants expressed their determination to follow Comrade Men He's example, "thinking of Chairman Mao in everything, obeying Chairman Mao in everything, following Chairman Mao in everything, and doing everything for Chairman Mao." They will intensify class struggle, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind; continue to carry out the revolutionary criticism movement deeply and persistently, and launch fierce attacks on the class enemies without stopping, seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The brigade women's federation director and militia platoon leader said: Some days ago, I mistakenly thought that the "Taoyuan Experience" concocted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his bourgeois wife Wang XX here had been criticized to the point of being stinky, and their black henchman Guan Jingdong had been exposed, so I had the idea of relaxing the revolutionary criticism. In the future, I will definitely follow Comrade Men He's example, always stand guard for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and fight a good battle. Now, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Taoyuan Brigade have further launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. They have brought the activities of learning from Comrade Men He and carrying out revolutionary criticism to the fields, making revolution and promoting production a blazing success.

    贫下中农大力开展学习门合同志的活动
    桃园掀起狠批中国赫鲁晓夫新高潮
    据新华社石家庄电　河北省抚宁县卢王庄公社桃园大队广大贫下中农，在解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，大力开展学习门合同志的活动。他们在门合同志的革命精神鼓舞下，狠抓阶级斗争，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义，推动了革命的大批判深入持久地向前发展。
    贫下中农把学习门合同志的活动，当作是对中国赫鲁晓夫的沉重打击，是推动革命大批判继续深入持久向前发展的巨大动力，当作是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的重要组成部分，是实现人的思想革命化，培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的重要措施。
    在学习门合同志的活动中，驻军毛泽东思想宣传队和广大贫下中农开展了“五比、五看、五批”的活动。即：一，比门合同志无限忠于人民，无限忠于党，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的崇高品质，看自己对毛主席有没有不忠的表现，批判中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想、反对毛主席革命路线的滔天罪行。二，比门合同志坚决执行、誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的革命精神，看自己对毛主席的革命路线是否做到了坚决执行、誓死捍卫，批判中国赫鲁晓夫对贫下中农坚决执行、誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线进行阻挠、破坏的罪恶事实。三，比门合同志如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，坚持活学活用、学用结合的优良学风，看自己有没有学用脱节，批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派污蔑贫下中农学习毛主席著作是“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“实用主义”等谬论。四，比门合同志“毫不利己专门利人”的共产主义风格，看自己一事当前是不是“公”字领先，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“公私溶化”论、“大公有私”论。五，比门合同志密切联系群众，始终保持劳动人民艰苦朴素的本色，看自己的群众观念强不强，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的脱离群众、压制群众、打击群众的资产阶级反动路线。
    通过开展“五比、五看、五批”活动，广大贫下中农为门合同志的革命精神和崇高品质所鼓舞，进一步激发了对中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的仇恨，更加热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。广大贫下中农纷纷表示，要象门合同志那样，“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席”。要狠抓阶级斗争，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案风；继续深入持久地开展革命的大批判，主动地不停顿地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。大队妇联主任、民兵排长说：前些日子，我错误地认为中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆资产阶级分子王××在这里炮制的“桃园经验”，已经被批得臭不可闻，他们的黑爪牙关景东也揪了出来，因此产生了放松革命大批判的想法。今后一定要象门合同志那样，时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗。现在，桃园大队的广大贫下中农，进一步掀起了革命大批判的新高潮，他们把学习门合同志的活动和革命大批判都带到了田间地头，抓革命促生产搞得热火朝天。
