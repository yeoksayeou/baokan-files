The Malayan National Liberation League's delegation in China's organ paper "Malayan News" recently published an article exposing the Soviet revisionist clique's intensified collusion with the new colonialist product, the "Malaysia" puppets, to suppress the national liberation movements in Malaya and North Borneo and to oppose socialist China.

The article states that in the sinister plot of U.S.-Soviet collusion to dominate the world, the Soviet revisionist clique attaches great importance to Malaya, because Malaya is located between the Pacific and Indian Oceans, holding significant strategic importance for their encirclement of China. Since this year, the Soviet revisionist clique has been making further efforts in the political, economic, and cultural spheres to intensify their collusion with the Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew puppet regimes.

The article states that the first ambassador of the Soviet revisionist clique arrived in Kuala Lumpur in March this year. The Singapore puppet foreign ministry also announced that the "Republic of Singapore" established ambassador-level diplomatic relations with the Soviet revisionist clique on June 1. The revolutionary people of Malaya condemn the shameless betrayal of the Soviet revisionists exchanging diplomatic envoys with these puppet regimes.

The article states that the Soviet revisionist clique has been politically boosting the morale of the Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew puppet regimes. They share the same counter-revolutionary stance with the reactionary puppet regimes and strongly support the puppet regimes' anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people policies.

Due to Britain's announcement of a significant reduction in its colonial troops in Malaya, various reactionary forces from Japan, India, Burma to New Zealand, with the support of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, have all sent representatives to visit Malaya. The Malayan puppets have also made reciprocal visits to these countries. Under the guise of "trade and economic cooperation," they attempt to organize new military alliances.

The Soviet revisionist clique is terrified of China's immense prestige in the world, especially in the revolutionary storm center of Southeast Asia, and of the profound influence of Mao Zedong Thought on the revolutionary struggles of the people worldwide, particularly in this region.

The article states that the Soviet revisionists recently invited the deputy prime minister of the "Malaysia" puppets, Razak, to visit the Soviet Union. This is to implement the policy of frequent mutual visits at various levels between the Malayan puppets and the Soviet revisionist leaders. The Soviet revisionist leader Podgorny even personally assured Razak of full support for the "Malaysia" puppets.

The Soviet revisionist clique even plans to provide weapons to the puppet regime to suppress the national liberation movements in Malaya and North Borneo. The puppet Razak once boasted, "We have no prejudice against Russian weapons. We are friends with the Russians."

The article states that as early as 1966, the Soviet revisionist clique began dirty dealings with the Malayan puppets through trade and economic "aid." Since then, Soviet neo-colonialism has intensified its infiltration.

Last November, when rubber prices plummeted, the world capitalist crisis deepened, and the old Malayan dollar devalued, the Soviet modern revisionists spared no effort to support Malaya's colonial economy. In February this year, the Soviet revisionists established a "Trade Commissioner's Office" in Malaya. In the first few months of this year, with the increase in rubber freight rates, the Soviet revisionists eagerly proposed providing ships to serve the local tycoons. The Soviet revisionist clique has never missed an opportunity to aid the puppet regime.

The article states that to strengthen their counter-revolutionary bridgehead in Southeast Asia, the Soviet revisionist clique has also intensified its activities in many other fields. They spread revisionism through literary and artistic forms, invite various groups for mutual visits, and sign so-called "cultural exchange and mutual dispatch of students" plans with the puppet regime.

The article concludes by stating that the Malayan people are aware of the sinister plots orchestrated by the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet revisionist clique. The counter-revolutionary actions of the modern revisionists will only make us more deeply understand that "to oppose imperialism, we must oppose revisionism." The Malayan Communist Party educates the Malayan people to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and use Chairman Mao's teachings to complete the revolutionary tasks. We will persist in armed struggle against U.S. and British imperialism and the Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew puppet regimes until we achieve final victory.

    谴责苏修集团勾结“马来西亚”傀儡
    揭露苏修竟要提供武器来镇压马来亚和北加里曼丹的民族解放运动
    新华社二十七日讯  马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团机关刊物《马来亚公报》最近发表文章，揭露苏修叛徒集团加紧勾结新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”傀儡，镇压马来亚和北加里曼丹的民族解放运动，反对社会主义中国。
    文章说，在美苏勾结主宰世界的罪恶阴谋中，苏修叛徒集团很重视马来亚，因为，马来亚位于太平洋和印度洋之间，对于它们包围中国有着重要战略意义。今年以来，苏修叛徒集团在政治、经济、文化等方面，一直在为加紧同拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡集团的勾结作进一步的努力。
    文章说，苏修叛徒集团的第一任大使今年三月到吉隆坡。新加坡傀儡外交部也宣布，“新加坡共和国”在六月一日同苏修集团建立了大使级外交关系。马来亚革命人民谴责苏修同这些傀儡政权互换外交使节的无耻背叛行径。
    文章说，苏修叛徒集团在政治上一直在给拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡政权打气，他们同反动的傀儡政权有着同样的反革命立场，并且大力支持傀儡政权的反共、反华和反人民的政策。
    由于英国宣布大大削减在马来亚的殖民军队，最近从日本、印度、缅甸到新西兰等形形色色的反动势力，在美帝苏修的支持下，都派人访问了马来亚。马来亚的傀儡们也对这些国家进行了回访。他们在“贸易和经济合作”的幌子下妄图组织新的军事同盟。
    苏修叛徒集团对中国在全世界，特别是在世界革命风暴中心东南亚的巨大威信怕得要死，对毛泽东思想对全世界人民的革命斗争，特别是对这一地区的革命斗争的深远影响怕得要死。
    文章说，苏修最近邀请“马来西亚”傀儡副总理拉扎克访问苏联。这是为了执行马来亚傀儡和苏修领导人之间经常进行各级互访的政策。苏修头目波德戈尔内还当面向拉扎克保证，给予“马来西亚”傀儡全面的支持。
    苏修叛徒集团甚至打算向傀儡政权提供武器，来镇压马来亚和北加里曼丹的民族解放运动。傀儡拉扎克曾得意忘形地说：“我们对俄国的武器不存偏见。我们同俄国人是朋友。”
    文章说，苏修叛徒集团早在一九六六年就通过贸易和经济“援助”，开始同马来亚傀儡搞肮脏交易。从那时起，苏修新殖民主义加紧了渗透。
    去年十一月，当橡胶价格大跌、世界资本主义危机和旧马来亚元贬值时，苏联现代修正主义者曾尽一切力量，来支持马来亚的殖民经济。今年二月，苏修又在马来亚设立了“贸易专员办事处”。今年头几个月，橡胶运费上涨，苏修叛徒们又欣然提议提供船只，为当地的财主效劳。苏修叛徒集团从来没有放过一个机会来援助傀儡政权。
    文章说，苏修叛徒集团为了加强他们在东南亚的反革命桥头堡，还在其他许多领域加倍扩大活动。他们通过文学艺术的形式散布修正主义，邀请各种团体互相访问，还同傀儡政权签订所谓“文化交流和互派留学生计划”。
    文章最后说，马来亚人民洞悉以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义者所策划的毒辣阴谋。现代修正主义者的反革命行动，只会使我们更深刻地认识到“反帝必须反修”。马来亚共产党教育我们马来亚人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，运用毛主席的教导来完成革命任务。我们将坚持对美英帝国主义和拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡集团进行武装斗争，直到取得最后的胜利。
