Revolutionary workers in Shuangyashan Mining Area and Niu Xintai Coal Mine are focusing on revolution and promoting production. They are using revolution as a powerful force to increase coal production. They have struck down a handful of class enemies and have successfully completed the national coal production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, June 18: The revolutionary workers in Shuangyashan Mining Area in Heilongjiang Province, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and focused on class struggle. They have carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, promoting continuous development in production. Now, the coal production plan for the first half of the year in this mining area has been completed ahead of schedule by 17 days, and all mines in the area have achieved overproduction.

	Since the beginning of this year, the revolutionary committee and the revolutionary workers in this mining area have kept in mind Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle." They have launched a high tide of exposure, criticism, and struggle against a handful of class enemies throughout the mining area, further developing the good situation. Revolutionary workers, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a fierce criticism of the revisionist black goods advocated by China's Khrushchev, such as the "extinction of class struggle," "money as the commander," "material incentives," and "expert management." Every mine has set up a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary workers have also closely linked revolutionary criticism with the struggle against enemies within their units, effectively smashing the rightist reversal wind and evil plots of a handful of class enemies, including those in power, to sabotage the revolution and production. This has greatly heightened class struggle and line struggle awareness, driving the revolutionary and production situation to be better and better.

	In the battle to focus on revolution and promote production, revolutionary workers have demonstrated the spirit of great communist cooperation. Above-ground workers create conditions for underground workers, and auxiliary workers actively serve production workers, working together to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to link with the masses." The leaders of the revolutionary committees at various levels in Shuangyashan Mining Area have followed the great teachings of Chairman Mao, the great leader, and have gone deep into the front lines of class struggle and production struggle, focusing on revolution and promoting production. Baoshan Mine had been relatively passive in revolution and production last year. Since the beginning of this year, with the help of the leftist support troops stationed in the mine, the members of the revolutionary committees at various levels have followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "being both an official and a common person," going deep among the masses, leading the revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on class enemies, being both commanders and fighters in focusing on revolution and promoting production, and thus winning one victory after another with the revolutionary masses.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 18: The revolutionary workers of Niu Xintai Coal Mine in Benxi, who have continuously achieved new successes in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in the mine, advanced along the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, using revolution as a powerful force for production development. Based on completing the national coal production plan 21 days ahead of schedule last year, the mine has completed the national production plan for the first half of this year 33 days ahead of schedule, achieving double victories in revolution and production. The average daily coal production this year has increased by 15.8% compared to the same period last year, labor productivity has increased by 16%, product quality has improved, and costs have been reduced.

	The great news of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin receiving the representatives of the national coal mine conference on focusing on revolution and promoting production has greatly inspired the revolutionary workers of this coal mine. They are full of fighting spirit and enthusiasm, creating the highest daily production record since the mine was built.

	Chairman Mao teaches: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary people it leads and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The revolutionary committee of the mine has followed Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," focusing on class struggle, leading the revolutionary workers to launch continuous and fierce attacks on class enemies, and digging out the hidden handful of class enemies. They have followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the party," educating the broad masses of workers to correctly distinguish and handle the two types of different contradictions, uniting all possible revolutionary forces, and accurately and fiercely striking down a handful of class enemies, making the revolution and production in the entire mine present a new and vibrant situation.

	Revolutionary workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a revolutionary criticism of the revisionist line pushed by China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party in enterprises, greatly heightening class struggle and line struggle awareness.

	In the class struggle, revolutionary workers insist on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism.

	Great leader Chairman Mao points out: "Revolution is to liberate productive forces, revolution is to promote the development of productive forces." The revolutionary workers of Niu Xintai Coal Mine have used the sky-high enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and applied it to production, greatly promoting the development of production. Revolutionary workers have overcome natural difficulties such as poor geological conditions, significant coal seam changes, and frequent roof water seepage, continuously creating outstanding achievements of stable and high production.

    毛主席教导说：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”矿革委会遵照毛主席的最新指示和“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，狠抓阶级斗争，带领广大革命职工不停顿地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，把隐藏的一小撮阶级敌人挖了出来。他们遵照毛主席“政策和策略是党的生命”的伟大教导，教育广大职工正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，使全矿革命、生产出现了一片崭新气象。

    广大革命职工在阶级斗争中坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，斗私批修。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展。牛心台煤矿广大革命职工把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产上去，极大地促进了生产的发展。广大革命职工克服了地质条件差，煤层变化大，顶板淋水多等自然困难，连续创造了稳产高产的优异成绩。
