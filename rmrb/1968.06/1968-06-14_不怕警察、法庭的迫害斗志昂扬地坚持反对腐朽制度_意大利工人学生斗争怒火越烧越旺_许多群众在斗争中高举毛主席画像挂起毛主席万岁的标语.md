Italian students have displayed great revolutionary spirit, fearlessly facing persecution from the police and courts, and steadfastly continuing their just struggle against the decaying capitalist social and educational systems.

The Italian reactionary authorities, terrified by the overwhelming revolutionary storm sweeping through France, have recently intensified the use of police, courts, and prisons to suppress progressive students, attempting to extinguish the burgeoning student movement in Italy. Currently, dozens of students have been unjustly sentenced, over a hundred have been imprisoned, and nearly seven hundred are either on trial or awaiting trial. In Rome, three professors who expressed support for the students' rebellious actions have also been "prosecuted" by the reactionary authorities. However, the more they oppress, the more we resist. The flames of the Italian people's struggle are burning brighter and brighter.

In the northern Italian city of Milan, over three thousand students, supported by comrades from Rome, Turin, Florence, and other places, gathered and marched in the city center on the evening of the 7th to protest against the decaying educational system, the government's brutal suppression of the student movement, and the bourgeois media's despicable slander of the student movement. The Italian reactionary authorities deployed over three thousand police officers for brutal suppression. Milan students built barricades and fought bravely against the police throughout the night. On the morning of the 8th, a large number of reactionary police stormed into several universities in Milan, arbitrarily driving the students out of the campus.

However, the progressive students in Milan were not intimidated. They overcame numerous difficulties and continued to fight tenaciously. Students at the State University of Milan sternly condemned the authorities' brutality and demanded the resignation of the university president. Many professors at this university sympathized with and supported the students' just struggle. Students at the Catholic University of Milan held a mass meeting on the evening of the 8th, deciding to reoccupy their school and demanding the abolition of reactionary school rules that persecute students for political and religious reasons. Hundreds of students at this university repeatedly charged against the police who had unjustly occupied the school. To support the students' struggle, many associate professors boycotted exams conducted under police baton supervision. The scope of students occupying the Milan Polytechnic Institute recently expanded from two departments to seven. Students at Bocconi University also occupied the foreign language department of this university.

Students in other Italian cities are also bravely continuing the fight. In the Italian capital, Rome, after the reactionary authorities deployed 1,500 police to seize Rome University on the 3rd, students outside the campus called for unity among workers, peasants, and students to strengthen the struggle against reactionary rule. Students in the Humanities Department of Rome University held two meetings on the 11th, strongly demanding that the school authorities expel the police from the campus.

In the central Italian city of Pesaro, students and workers recently held a rally in support of the French people's struggle, which was brutally suppressed by the police. Over three hundred people were prosecuted by the reactionary authorities on various "charges." However, the progressive students and workers in Pesaro continued to fight side by side. They held another strike and demonstration to protest the authorities' brutality.

In Turin, students occupying the Political Science Institute issued a statement on the evening of the 8th, emphasizing that Italian students not only demand educational reform but also seek to change the social system, that is, to "carry out a political revolution."

In Florence, two thousand students marched with portraits of Chairman Mao and red flags. Students in Bologna also took action to occupy their schools.

The burgeoning student movement in Italy has inspired and driven Italian artists to rebel. Recently, artists in Milan occupied the triennial art exhibition held in Milan. They issued a statement expressing their determination to support and participate in the workers' and students' struggle against the decaying capitalist system. They hung a bright red banner with the words "Long Live Chairman Mao" on the wall.

At the famous La Scala Opera House in Milan, progressive actors and technicians held a meeting on the 10th, calling on all artists and technicians in the theater to unite and fight alongside students, workers, and other artists. (Photo attached)

In Naples, Italy, tram workers overturned trams to create barricades and used sticks and stones as weapons, engaging in fierce battles with the police.

    新华社十三日讯　罗马消息：意大利学生发扬了大无畏的革命精神，不怕警察、法庭的迫害，斗志昂扬地坚持反对腐朽的资本主义的社会和教育制度的正义斗争。
    被法国人民排山倒海的革命风暴吓破了胆的意大利反动当局，最近加紧使用警察、法庭、监狱等镇压工具，疯狂地迫害进步学生，妄想借此扑灭意大利日益高涨的学生运动。目前，已有几十名学生被无理判刑，一百多人被囚禁，七百多人正在或即将“受审”。罗马有三位教授表示支持学生造反行动，因此也被反动当局“起诉”。可是，压迫越大，反抗越强。意大利人民斗争的怒火正在越烧越旺。
    意大利北部大城市米兰的三千多名学生，在来自罗马、都灵、佛罗伦萨等地的同学的支持下，七日晚在市中心集会和游行，反对腐朽的教育制度，反对政府镇压学生运动的暴行，抗议资产阶级报刊污蔑学生运动的卑鄙行为。意大利反动当局出动了三千多名警察进行残暴镇压，米兰学生筑起街垒，英勇地同警察通宵搏斗。八日清晨，大批反动警察冲进米兰的几所大学，蛮横无理地把学生赶出校园。
    但是，米兰的进步学生并没有被吓倒。他们克服了重重困难，正在顽强地坚持斗争。米兰国立大学的学生们严正地谴责当局的暴行，要求校长辞职。这所大学的许多教授同情并支持学生们的正义斗争。米兰天主教大学的学生，八日晚举行了群众大会，决定要重新占领自己的学校，并要求废除以政治和宗教上的种种借口来迫害学生的反动校规。这所大学的几百名学生多次向无理霸占着学校的警察进行了冲击。为了支援学生的斗争，许多副教授抵制在警棍监护下进行考试。米兰综合工业学院学生占领学校的范围，最近从两个系扩大到了七个系。博克科尼商业大学的学生也占领了这个大学的外语系。
    意大利其他城市的学生也在英勇地坚持战斗。在意大利首都罗马，反动当局三日出动一千五百名警察强占罗马大学以后，学生们在校外呼吁工人、农民、学生团结起来，加强反对反动统治的斗争。罗马大学人文系学生十一日两次集会，强烈要求学校当局把警察赶出校园。
    在意大利中部的佩扎罗，学生和工人最近联合举行声援法国人民斗争的集会，遭到警察残暴的镇压，有三百多人被反动当局以各种“罪名起诉”。可是，佩扎罗的进步学生和工人继续并肩战斗。他们再次举行了罢工和示威，抗议当局的暴行。
    在都灵，占领政治学院的学生八日晚发表声明强调指出，意大利学生不仅要求改革教育制度，而且要改变社会制度，就是要“进行一场政治革命”。
    在佛罗伦萨，二千名学生高举着毛主席的画像和红旗，举行了示威游行。波伦亚的学生也采取了占领学校的行动。
    意大利日益高涨的学生运动，鼓舞并推动着意大利的艺术工作者起来造反。米兰的艺术工作者最近占领了三年一度在米兰举行的艺术展览会。他们发表声明，表示决心支持并参加工人和学生反对腐朽的资本主义制度的斗争。他们在墙壁上挂起一条写有毛主席万岁字样的鲜艳夺目的红色的标语。
    在米兰的著名的斯卡拉歌剧院，进步的演员和技工也在十日举行会议，号召剧院的全体艺术家和技工们团结起来，同学生、工人以及其他艺术工作者并肩战斗。（附图片）
