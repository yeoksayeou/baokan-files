In Meitan County, Guizhou Province, the broad revolutionary masses all call Zhang Maohuai, Chairman of the County Revolutionary Committee, the good "class leader" of the revolutionary committee and a good servant of the people.

Zhang Maohuai is the Political Commissioner of the Meitan County People's Armed Forces Department. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he faithfully executed the great leader Chairman Mao's battle command of "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," resolutely supporting the proletarian revolutionary factions in the county, and achieving victory in the struggle to seize power from the old county committee's clique of capitalist roaders. After assuming the position of Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, he led the way in studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasping class struggle, closely linking with the masses, and bringing the glorious traditions of the army into the Revolutionary Committee, setting a good example for the members of the County Revolutionary Committee.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to Promote Revolution and Production

On the day the County Revolutionary Committee was established, Zhang Maohuai proposed: The members of the Revolutionary Committee must always, in all things and in all places, be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They must regard studying, executing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought as a sacred duty, and use the great Mao Zedong Thought to hold power properly and use it well. The first thing he did in the County Revolutionary Committee was to lead the people of the entire county to extensively and deeply carry out activities of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The first decision made by the County Revolutionary Committee was to call on the people of the entire county to quickly launch a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Whenever Chairman Mao issued a new directive, Zhang Maohuai immediately organized the people of the entire county to study and implement it.

During the days when the County Revolutionary Committee was just established and work was particularly busy, no matter how late Zhang Maohuai worked, the next morning, he was always the first to rush to the County Revolutionary Committee, studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and reciting the "Three Constantly Read Articles" with everyone. Every late night, he would study the works of Chairman Mao, examine and check his thoughts and work for the day, and then rest.

Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee more than a year ago, despite having a physical illness, he often carried a bag containing Chairman Mao's works, newspapers, study notes, and work notebooks, going up mountains and down to the countryside, covering most of the eight districts of the entire county. Even the most remote Wanma Commune had his footprints. Wherever there were difficulties and problems, he went there to study Chairman Mao's works with the masses and solve problems together.

Last year, during the rice transplanting season, Meitan County did not have rain for dozens of days in a row. Under the leadership of the newly born Revolutionary Committee, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants launched a fierce battle against nature for water, time, and grain. A clique of capitalist roaders within the Party thought this was an opportunity for a counterattack. They shouted wildly: "There are problems with production because there are problems with supporting the left." They slandered Zhang Maohuai and attempted to use temporary difficulties in production to overthrow the newly born Revolutionary Committee.

Zhang Maohuai firmly believed that the broad poor and lower-middle peasants loved Chairman Mao and stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He led the County Revolutionary Committee and the comrades of the People's Armed Forces Department to face the difficulties and went to the countryside in groups.

Zhang Maohuai arrived in Xinglong District. That day, he and the district and commune armed forces cadres and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants analyzed the situation of grasping revolution and promoting production in the countryside, and determined a work plan to fully mobilize the masses. The next morning, he endured stomach pain, barely ate half a bowl of rice, and went deep into the communes and production brigades. Along the way, he propagated to the poor and lower-middle peasants Chairman Mao's teachings of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "never forget class struggle," and propagated the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country." He inquired everywhere about the situation of studying Chairman Mao's works by the commune members, helped to establish the system of studying Chairman Mao's works, used Chairman Mao's teachings to mobilize cadres and masses to grasp class struggle, and do a good job in drought resistance and transplanting. That day, he investigated half of the commune's production brigades and production teams, visited dozens of households of poor and lower-middle peasants.

It was already late at night, but Zhang Maohuai had not slept. He lit an oil lamp, opened Chairman Mao's works, covered his stomach, endured the pain, and studied Chairman Mao's discussions on the peasant movement with a hungry and eager mind. He carefully thought about the situation and problems he had learned that day, and drafted the work plan for the next day.

Li Shiming, the District Commander of the People's Armed Forces Department, woke up from his sleep and saw this situation, excitedly saying: "You have such severe stomach pain, don't go tomorrow, we guarantee to complete the task according to your requirements!"

Zhang Maohuai held Chairman Mao's works, gazed at the golden image of Chairman Mao on the cover, and firmly said: "Chairman Mao entrusted us with such an important task, and the Party and the people trust us so much. Not only this little illness, but even if we have to shed blood and sacrifice our lives, we must resolutely complete the task."

In this way, for five consecutive days, they walked hundreds of miles, propagated Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies to the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, quickly launched a wave of grasping revolution and promoting production in the vast rural areas, severely struck the class enemies, smashed the evil plots of a small clique of class enemies to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and further consolidated and developed the great alliance of revolution and the "three-in-one combination" of revolution. The broad commune members finally overcame the drought and achieved timely and full transplanting, laying a solid foundation for the agricultural harvest of the entire county in 1967.

Some people who are familiar with Zhang Maohuai said: "He doesn't seem to have any extraordinary abilities, and he is not familiar with local work. He just relies on his loyalty to Chairman Mao, on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and linking with the masses to do his work."

Caring for the Party and the Masses More Than for Oneself

As the "class leader" of the County Revolutionary Committee, Zhang Maohuai pays great attention to bringing into play the role of other committee members. No matter what is discussed, Zhang Maohuai always lets everyone express their opinions fully first, and then concentrates everyone's wisdom to make the correct decision. In every democratic life meeting of the County Revolutionary Committee, he always seriously conducts self-criticism and deeply examines his own shortcomings. In the more than a year he has been the Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, in the more than ten work notebooks he has kept, a large part of it is his deep involvement with the masses, listening to criticisms of the County Revolutionary Committee, the People's Armed Forces Department, especially of himself. Some comrades gave him advice: "Why do you always talk about your shortcomings?" He said: "Achievements will not run away if not mentioned, but problems will not be solved if not found."

He is very strict with himself but very enthusiastic towards other comrades. He said: "When class brothers have knots in their minds, we should warm them with our hearts, support them with our hands, care for them politically, and guide them with Mao Zedong Thought." The members of the County Revolutionary Committee, the cadres and soldiers of the People's Armed Forces Department, and some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, whoever has problems in their thoughts, whoever has difficulties in their work, he sees it in his eyes and keeps it in his heart. If he can't talk to you during the day, he will definitely come to find you at night. If it can't be solved today, he will definitely help solve it tomorrow.

Zhang Maohuai is a confidant of the masses in politics and a close friend of the masses in life. He himself suffers from stomach disease, and comrades and superiors have repeatedly urged him to go to the hospital for treatment, but he always postpones it. However, he always cares for his class brothers with fiery class feelings. Just as Chairman Mao taught: "Caring for the Party and the masses is more important than caring for oneself, and caring for others is more important than caring for oneself."

Once, he and a comrade from the County People's Armed Forces Department went to Huangjiaba District to work. Hearing from the District Commander of the People's Armed Forces Department that the military dependents of Luojia Bridge Production Brigade in Qiping Production Team, Wei Dingshen, were sick and had some difficulties in life, he said to the comrades: "When the people's lives are difficult, we servants have the responsibility to help them." So, they detoured more than ten miles to Wei Dingshen's home. Zhang Maohuai sat by the old man's bed, asking him warmly, warming the old man's heart.

When they learned that the firewood mountain was relatively far and Wei Dingshen's family had difficulties in getting firewood, they immediately borrowed a few firewood axes, braved the howling north wind, and walked dozens of miles to a firewood mountain far away to chop firewood for Wei Dingshen's family.

On the way, Zhang Maohuai also inquired from the District Commander of the People's Armed Forces Department about the living conditions of all military dependents and families of martyrs in the entire district, and discussed together how to arrange their food, clothing, and firewood.

A bundle after bundle of firewood was sent to Wei Dingshen's home. The old man was so moved that tears streamed down his face, and he looked up at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall for a long time, saying with gratitude: "The People's Liberation Army is truly the kin sent by Chairman Mao! We will never forget Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army for generations!"

Zhang Maohuai said: "Old man, Chairman Mao teaches us to serve the people, this is what we should do. Your son is serving the people in the army, we are your sons!"

Participating in Labor to Eliminate Officialism

"The great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of 'being both an official and a common person' has become a powerful weapon for Zhang Maohuai to achieve ideological revolutionization. As soon as the Revolutionary Committee was established, he told the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee: 'We are servants of the people, not the people serving us. We cannot for a moment leave the masses, and we cannot for a moment leave labor.'

Zhang Maohuai went wherever he went, always worked with the masses, wielding hoes and hammers, regarding participating in collective production labor as the battlefield for criticizing and repudiating oneself and modifying the bourgeoisie, and regarding hoes and hammers as weapons to eliminate officialism.

Last year, during the busy rice transplanting season, Zhang Maohuai and the comrades of the County People's Armed Forces Department went to Shuanglong Production Brigade in Shuanglong Commune to help with rice transplanting. During labor, the soldiers and the masses saw his emaciated body, only letting him do some light work like carrying rice seedlings, but he insisted on doing heavy work, carrying heavy loads, and transplanting rice seedlings. During rest, he propagated Mao Zedong Thought in the fields and discussed with everyone the measures to implement Chairman Mao's latest directives.

Last year, the first session of the Mao Zedong Thought Study Class for the members of the County Revolutionary Committee and the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations was held in Yongxing Commune. They followed the principle of "running the school like the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University," producing while studying. Every morning, they studied a section and then went with the commune members to cut rice, deliver public grain, and so on. Knowing that Zhang Maohuai was sick, they did not let him work like everyone else, but he insisted on working ahead of everyone. When the commune members knew that the person working the hardest was the Chairman of the County Revolutionary Committee, they were so moved that they surrounded him and said: "You are truly a good cadre sent by Chairman Mao. In the past, not to mention such a big 'official,' even some cadres in the district did not work with us like this." Zhang Maohuai replied: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people.' Compared to Chairman Mao's teachings, I still have a lot to do, and I hope everyone will help and supervise me more."

The more one participates in collective production labor, the more one grows a red heart for serving the people; the more one sweats with the masses in labor, the more one grows proletarian revolutionary feelings. Zhang Maohuai's excellent quality of wholeheartedly serving the people has won the support of the masses.

Following Zhang Maohuai's lead, the members of the County Revolutionary Committee all strive to achieve ideological revolutionization. Among the thirteen members of the County Revolutionary Committee, ten have not left their original units' labor. Of the seven standing committee members, except for leaving one person at home to handle work, the others, like Zhang Maohuai, carry their bags, and wherever they go, they work there, propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the masses there, participate in collective production labor there, grasp class struggle there, and implement Chairman Mao's latest directives with the masses there.

    好“班长”
    ——记湄潭县革命委员会主任张茂怀同志
    在贵州省湄潭县，广大革命群众都把县革命委员会主任张茂怀同志称作革委会的好“班长”、人民的好勤务员。
    张茂怀同志是湄潭县人民武装部政治委员。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他忠实执行了伟大领袖毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的战斗号令，坚决地支持县里的无产阶级革命派，取得了向旧县委内一小撮走资派夺权斗争的胜利。他担任革命委员会主任以后，带头活学活用毛泽东思想，狠抓阶级斗争，密切联系群众，把解放军的光荣传统带进革命委员会，为县革委会成员树立了良好的榜样。
    用毛泽东思想抓革命促生产
    县革命委员会成立的那一天，张茂怀同志就提出：革委会的成员，要时时、事事、处处忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，要把学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想当作神圣的职责，要用伟大的毛泽东思想掌好权、用好权。他在县革命委员会中带头做的第一件事，就是领导全县人民广泛深入地开展忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的活动。县革委会做出的第一个决定，就是号召全县人民迅速掀起活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的新高潮。毛主席发出每一项最新指示，张茂怀同志都立即组织全县人民学习和落实。
    在县革委会刚刚成立，工作特别繁忙的日子，张茂怀同志不管工作到多么晚，第二天清早，总是最先赶到县革委会，同大家一起学习《毛主席语录》，背诵“老三篇”。每天深夜，他都要学习毛主席著作，对照检查一天的思想和工作，然后才休息。
    县革委会成立一年多来，他不顾身体有病，经常背着装有毛主席著作、报刊、学习笔记和工作手册的挂包，上山下乡，跑遍了全县八个区的大多数公社，连最边远的万马公社，也留有他的足迹。那个地方有困难，有问题，他就到那里去和群众一块学习毛主席著作，一块解决问题。
    去年，正值插秧季节，湄潭县一连几十天没有下雨。广大贫下中农在新生的革命委员会的领导下，展开了一场与天争水、争时间、争粮食的激烈战斗。党内一小撮走资派以为这是一个反扑的时机，他们狂喊乱叫：“生产有问题，是因为支左有问题。”他们造谣诬蔑张茂怀同志，妄图借生产上的暂时困难，把新生的革命委员会搞垮。
    张茂怀同志坚信广大贫下中农是热爱毛主席的，是站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边的。他带领县革命委员会和人民武装部的同志，迎着困难，分头到农村去了。
    张茂怀来到了兴隆区。当天，他和区、社人民武装干部及广大贫下中农一起，认真分析了农村抓革命促生产的形势，确定了充分发动群众的工作计划。第二天一早，他忍着胃痛，勉强吃了半碗饭，又深入到社队去了。一路上，他一队一队地向贫下中农宣传毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产”、“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，宣传《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》。他到处询问社员学习毛主席著作的情况，帮助健全学习毛主席著作的制度，用毛主席的教导动员干部和群众抓好阶级斗争，搞好抗旱抢种工作。这一天，他调查了大半个公社的大队和生产队，访问了几十户贫下中农。
    天已经很晚了，张茂怀还没有睡。他点起煤油灯，打开毛主席著作，捂着肚子，忍着疼痛，如饥似渴地学习毛主席关于农民运动的论述，仔细地思索着一天来所了解的情况和问题，拟定出第二天的工作计划。
    从睡梦中醒来的区人民武装部长李世明看到这种情况，激动地说：“你胃痛得那么厉害，明天就不要再去了，我们保证按你的要求完成任务！”
    张茂怀捧着毛主席著作，凝视着封面上金光闪闪的毛主席像，坚决地说：“毛主席交给我们这样重要的工作，党和人民对我们这样信任，不要说这点小病，就是抛头颅，洒热血，也要坚决完成任务。”
    就这样，连续五天，他们走了四五百里路，向广大贫下中农宣传了毛泽东思想，宣传了党的方针、政策，广大农村很快掀起了抓革命促生产的热潮，狠狠打击了阶级敌人，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶阴谋，进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。广大社员终于战胜了干旱，作到了及时满栽满插，为全县一九六七年的农业丰收打下了坚实的基础。
    一些熟悉张茂怀的人都说：“他表面上没有什么过人之处，对地方工作也不熟悉，他就是凭着对毛主席的一片忠心，凭着活学活用毛泽东思想和联系群众的作风做好工作的。”
    关心党和群众比关心个人为重作为县革命委员会的
  “班长”，张茂怀很注意发挥其他委员的作用。不论讨论什么事，张茂怀总是先让大家充分发表意见，然后把大家的智慧集中起来，做出正确的决定。在每一次县革命委员会的民主生活会上，他又总是认真地进行自我批评，深刻检查自己的缺点。在他担任革委会主任一年多来，记下的十几本工作笔记中，很大一部分是他深入群众，从群众中听取来的对县革委会、人民武装部，特别是对他本人的批评。有的同志给他提意见：“你怎么老是讲自己的缺点？”他说：“成绩不讲跑不了，问题不找不得了。”
    他对自己要求很严格，对别的同志又非常热情。他说：“阶级兄弟思想上有了疙瘩，我们应该捧出心去暖他，伸出手去扶他，从政治上去关心他，用毛泽东思想去诱导他。”县革命委员会机关的成员、人民武装部的干部和战士，以及革命群众组织的一些负责人，那个思想有问题，那个工作有困难，他都看在眼里，记在心上，白天不能跟你谈，晚上定要来找你，今天解决不了，明天定要帮助解决。
    张茂怀同志在政治上是群众的知心人，在生活上是群众的贴心人。他自己身患胃病，同志们和上级多次要他住院治疗，他都一推再推。可是，他总是以火热的阶级感情，关怀着阶级兄弟。正象毛主席所教导的那样：“关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。”
    一次，他和县人民武装部的一个同志到黄家坝区去工作。听区人民武装部长说，柿坪大队罗家桥生产队军属魏定民老大爷病了，生活上有些困难，他便对同志们说：“当人民生活有困难的时候，我们这些勤务员有责任帮助他们。”于是，他们绕道十多里，来到了魏老大爷家里。张茂怀坐在老大爷的病床边，一声声亲切的问候，温暖着魏老大爷的心。
    当他们知道这里柴山比较远，魏老大爷家烧柴有困难时，便马上借了几把柴刀，冒着呼呼叫的北风，走到几十里路以外的柴山上，给魏老大爷家砍柴。
    一路上，张茂怀又向区人民武装部长询问了全区军属、烈属的生活情况，共同商量了如何安排他们吃饭、穿衣、烧柴等生活问题。
    一大捆一大捆的烧柴，送到了魏老大爷的家里。老人家激动得热泪滚滚，久久地仰望着墙上的毛主席像，感激地说：“解放军真是毛主席派来的亲人啊！我们世世代代忘不了毛主席，忘不了解放军！”
    张茂怀说：“老人家，毛主席教导我们要为人民服务，这是我们应该做的事情。你的儿子在部队里为人民服务，我们就是你的儿子呀！”
    参加劳动　打掉官气
    “既当‘官’，又当老百姓。”我们伟大领袖毛主席的这一教导，成了张茂怀实现思想革命化的强大武器。革命委员会一成立，他便对革委会的同志们说：“我们是为人民服务的，不是人民为我们服务的。我们一时一刻不能脱离群众，一时一刻不能脱离劳动。”
    张茂怀每到一处，都和群众一起，挥锄头，抡铁锤，把参加集体生产劳动当作斗私批修的战场，把锄头、铁锤当作砸掉官气的武器。
    去年，插秧正紧张的时候，张茂怀和县人民武装部的同志们到双龙公社双龙生产队帮助插秧。在劳动中，战士们和群众看着他那消瘦的身体，只让他干些打秧把之类的轻活，但他却专拣重活干，挑肥争挑重担子，插秧也是带头干。休息的时候，他就在田间地头向战士和群众宣传毛泽东思想，和大家一起研究落实毛主席最新指示的措施。
    去年县革委会成员、革命群众组织负责人组成的全县第一期毛泽东思想学习班，是在永兴公社办的。他们按照抗大办校的方针，一面生产，一面学习。每天早上学习一段，就和社员一道割稻谷，送公粮……。知道张茂怀同志有病的人，不让他和大家一样干，他却坚决干在大家头里。当社员们知道这个干得最欢的人，原来是县革委会主任以后，感动得围着他说：“你真是毛主席派来的好干部。过去，莫说象你这样大的‘官’，就是区里有些干部也不象你这么跟我们一样劳动。”张茂怀回答说：“毛主席教导我们：‘我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员’。对照毛主席的教导，我还做得很不够，希望大家多多帮助和监督。”
    多参加一次集体生产劳动，就多长一分为人民服务的红心；多和群众在劳动中流一身汗水，就多一分无产阶级的革命感情。张茂怀全心全意为人民服务的优秀品质，得到了群众的拥护。
    前车急驶后车撵。在张茂怀的带动下，县革委会成员都努力实现思想革命化。在县革委会十三个委员中，有十个没有脱离原单位的劳动。七个常委，除经常留一个人在家主持工作外，其他的人都象张茂怀一样，背着挂包，走到那里，就在那里办公，就在那里向群众宣传毛泽东思想，就在那里参加集体生产劳动，就在那里抓阶级斗争，就在那里和群众一起落实毛主席的最新指示。　本报通讯员
