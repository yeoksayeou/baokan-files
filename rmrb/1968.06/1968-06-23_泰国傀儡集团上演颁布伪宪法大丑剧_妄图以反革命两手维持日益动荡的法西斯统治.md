The Thai puppet regime, under the control of the U.S. imperialists, staged a shameless political farce on June 20 in Bangkok by enacting a fake constitution. This was a despicable political trick played in front of the Thai people.

For over two years, the armed struggle led by the Communist Party of Thailand has been growing stronger, dealing heavier blows to the Thanom-Praphat puppet regime. The reactionary government's attempts to "suppress" the people's armed forces have met with repeated defeats. It is under these circumstances that the Thanom-Praphat puppet regime announced the enactment of its fake constitution. This regime attempts to use both armed suppression and political deception to extinguish the flames of the people's armed struggle, in order to maintain its increasingly shaky fascist military dictatorship.

Despite the Thanom-Praphat regime's charade of "returning power to the people," attempting to use the fake constitution's so-called "freedom of speech" and "universal suffrage" as a cover, its true nature is always exposed. At the same time as enacting the fake constitution, the Thanom-Praphat regime also issued a fascist decree banning the activities of the Communist Party and other patriotic political parties, and declared that the reactionary "martial law" would remain in effect. Additionally, according to Western news agencies, the Thanom-Praphat traitorous regime had already prepared a series of fascist decrees to control political parties, control "elections," and control the press, which are set to be issued and enforced in sequence. This completely exposes the fact that the enactment of the fake constitution is merely a trick, revealing the Thanom-Praphat regime's counter-revolutionary, anti-communist, and anti-people true colors.

A spokesperson for the Communist Party of Thailand recently stated that the enactment of the fake constitution is a major political deception by the U.S. imperialists and the Thanom regime. The statement emphasized that armed struggle is the only way for the Thai people to expel U.S. imperialism, overthrow the Thanom-Praphat traitorous regime, and achieve genuine independence and democracy.

    泰国傀儡集团上演颁布伪宪法大丑剧
    妄图以反革命两手维持日益动荡的法西斯统治
    新华社二十二日讯 曼谷消息：美帝国主义的走狗泰国他侬—巴博傀儡集团二十日在曼谷颁布伪宪法，在泰国人民面前玩弄了一场丑恶不堪的政治骗局。
    两年多来，泰国共产党领导下的人民武装斗争的烈火，越烧越旺，给予泰国他侬—巴博傀儡集团以越来越沉重的打击。泰国反动当局对人民武装的“围剿”不断遭到惨败。就在这种情况下，他侬—巴博傀儡集团宣布它的伪宪法出笼。这个傀儡集团妄图交替使用武装镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手来扑灭人民武装的熊熊烈火，维持它的日益动荡的法西斯军事独裁统治。
    尽管他侬—巴博集团在上演所谓“还政于民”的丑剧，妄图用伪宪法的所谓“言论自由”和“普选”等幌子来粉饰自己，但是，它的狐狸尾巴总是藏不住的。就在颁布伪宪法的同时，他侬—巴博集团还公布了一项禁止共产党和其他爱国政党活动的法西斯法令，并宣布反动的“戒严法”继续“有效”。此外，据西方通讯社透露，他侬—巴博卖国集团还早已预先制订了一系列控制政党组织、控制“选举”、控制报刊等法西斯法令，准备陆续公布施行。这就完全暴露了伪宪法的出笼只不过是一个骗局，暴露了他侬—巴博集团的反共、反人民的反革命狰狞面目。
    泰国共产党发言人不久以前曾发表声明揭露，颁布伪宪法是美帝—他侬集团的一个政治大骗局。声明强调指出，武装斗争是泰国人民驱逐美帝国主义，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团和争取国家的真正独立民主的唯一出路。
