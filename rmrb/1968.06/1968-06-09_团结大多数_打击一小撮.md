The important editorial "70 Million Sichuan People Are Advancing" from the *People's Daily* and *Liberation Army Daily* has conveyed our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship."

In studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must, in the current struggle, mobilize the masses, strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions, unite with the majority, and to the greatest extent possible, isolate and severely strike at a handful of class enemies.

The contradictions between the enemy and us and those within the people are two types of contradictions of different natures, and the methods of handling them must also be different. We must protect and rely on the broad masses of the people with enthusiasm. When there are some shortcomings and errors within the people, they need to be criticized, but we must do so from the standpoint of the people, with the fervor to protect and educate the people, adhering to the traditional policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future, curing the sickness to save the patient." As for a handful of class enemies, we must fully expose them and suppress them resolutely and mercilessly. Only in this way can our proletarian dictatorship be continuously consolidated and strengthened.

Currently, one of the important tactics of a handful of class enemies is to deliberately confuse the two types of contradictions, distort right and wrong, muddy the waters, and attempt to make us mistake enemies for friends, protect enemies, and mistake friends for enemies, creating divisions within the revolutionary ranks. If a handful of class enemies attempt to confuse the two types of contradictions, we must oppose them head-on and do the opposite. We must seriously study, deeply understand, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, unite with all those who can be united, organize a vast revolutionary army, and accurately and resolutely strike at a handful of class enemies.

    团结大多数  打击一小撮
    《人民日报》《解放军报》的重要社论《七千万四川人民在前进》传来了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”
    我们学习和贯彻毛主席的最新指示，在当前的斗争中，就要放手发动群众，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结大多数，最大限度地孤立和狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部矛盾，是两类性质不同的矛盾，处理的方法也必须不同。对广大人民群众，我们必须热情保护，坚决依靠。人民内部出现了一些缺点和错误，是需要批评的，“但必须是真正站在人民的立场上，用保护人民、教育人民的满腔热情来说话”，坚持“惩前毖后，治病救人”的传统方针。而对一小撮阶级敌人，我们就要充分揭露，坚决镇压，毫不留情。这样，我们的无产阶级专政才能不断得到巩固和加强。
    当前，一小撮阶级敌人的一个重要手法，就是拚命混淆两类矛盾，颠倒黑白，把水搅浑，妄图使我们认敌为友，对敌人实行保护；认友为敌，在革命队伍中制造分裂。一小撮阶级敌人妄图混淆两类矛盾，我们就要针锋相对，反其道而行之。我们一定要认真学习、深刻领会、坚决贯彻毛主席的这一最新指示，团结一切可以团结的人，组织起浩浩荡荡的革命大军，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。
