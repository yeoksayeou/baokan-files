The U.S. imperialists have intensified their economic aggression against Chile in recent years, deepening the contradictions between the two nations and stirring up continuous resistance from the Chilean people against the American plunderers.

Through economic infiltration over the past two years, American monopolistic capital has further controlled Chile's copper industry, the lifeblood of its economy, by establishing so-called "joint" copper companies. Subsequently, it has intensified its infiltration into other sectors of Chile's economy. In early May, the American-owned "Anglo-Lautaro" company decided to establish a "joint" company with the Chilean side to expand its plunder of Chile's other important natural resource—nitrate—and to monopolize the mining of iodine, manganese, and titanium. Apart from this, American monopolistic capital has also heavily infiltrated Chile's metallurgy, automobile assembly, textiles, machinery, food, paper, petrochemicals, chemical fibers, plastics, forestry, and fisheries sectors in recent times. According to official Chilean statistics, the total investment of American monopolistic capital in various sectors of Chile's economy has exceeded one billion dollars. Reports indicate that in April, two important officials from the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Treasury Department visited Chile to attempt to establish offices promoting "joint" companies in several important Chilean cities and to seek an agreement with the Chilean side to further reduce taxes for American enterprises.

American monopolistic capital has made huge profits through its economic aggression against Chile. According to official Chilean statistics, the profits remitted by the main foreign enterprises in Chile, which are mostly American, were $90 million in 1966 and increased to $110 million in 1967. These profits come not only from the plunder of Chile's natural resources but also from the exploitation of cheap Chilean labor. For example, the American-owned Chilean Telephone Company made over $3 million in profits last year but unreasonably refused to increase wages for Chilean workers. In the American-owned UTA Construction Company, the average wage for Chilean workers is only 500 escudos, while American employees earn more than ten times as much.

The unbridled plunder by American monopolistic capital has severely damaged Chile's national economy. American plunderers, through the establishment of "joint" companies, have seized greater profits, while Chile has surrendered large amounts of national resources and rights, increased foreign debt, and reduced tax revenue. This has worsened Chile's economic situation. Statistics show that by June 1967, Chile's foreign debt had reached $166.7 million, and by April this year, it had further increased to $200 million. In the past year, the Chilean currency depreciated by 32%, and by early May this year, it had depreciated nine more times. Chilean prices continue to rise.

It is under these circumstances that tens of thousands of workers, employees, and teachers from various industries in Chile, especially Chilean workers in American enterprises, have launched a massive strike wave since mid-March this year. This struggle is still ongoing. Meanwhile, some small and medium-sized Chilean national industries, due to being squeezed out and attacked by American monopolistic capital, are also growing in their resistance. Currently, the struggle of the Chilean working class against oppression and exploitation is developing, promoting the new awakening of the broad masses of Chilean workers and other strata of people. The Chilean newspaper *Spartacus* recently published an article condemning U.S. imperialism's plunder of Chile, stating: "We Chilean workers should unite like steel and resolutely fight against the exploiters led by U.S. imperialism and domestic monopolistic groups, and against their agents infiltrating the workers. The fate of Chilean workers depends on this struggle, and it can only depend on this struggle."

    美帝的掠夺促进了人民的觉醒  智利人民的反美怒潮不断高涨
    新华社讯　圣地亚哥消息：美帝国主义近年来全面加紧了对智利的经济侵略活动，从而加深了智美民族矛盾，并激起了智利人民对美国掠夺者的不断反抗。
    通过过去两年的经济渗透活动，美国垄断资本已经用建立所谓美智“联营”铜公司的方式，进一步控制了作为智利经济命脉的铜工业，加强了对智利铜的掠夺。接着，它又加紧渗入智利其它经济部门。今年五月上旬，美资“安格洛·劳塔罗”公司也决定用同智利方面建立一个“联营”公司的办法，来扩大它对智利的另一种重要天然资源——硝石的掠夺，并且垄断智利的碘、锰、钛的开采。除此以外，美国垄断资本在过去一个时期还大举渗入智利的冶金、汽车装配、纺织、机械、食品、造纸、石油化学、化学纤维、塑料、林业、渔业等重要经济部门。根据智利官方统计的数字，美国垄断资本在智利各经济部门的总投资已经达到十亿美元以上。据报道，今年四月，美国商务部和财政部的两名重要官员曾先后到达智利，企图在智利的几个重要城市建立促进智美“联营”公司的代办处，并寻求同智利方面达成一项进一步减免美国企业的捐税的协定。
    美国垄断资本通过对智利的经济侵略活动大发横财。据智利官方统计数字，在智利的主要属于美国的外国企业，在一九六六年汇出的利润是九千万美元，而在一九六七年增加到一亿一千万美元。这些利润除了来自对智利天然资源的掠夺，还来自对智利廉价劳动力的剥削。例如，美资智利电话公司去年一年获利三百多万美元，却无理拒绝给智利工人增加工资。在美资乌塔建筑公司中，智利工人的平均工资只有五百埃斯库多，而美国职员的工资竟比智利工人高十倍以上。
    美国垄断资本的肆无忌惮的掠夺，严重地摧残着智利的民族经济。美国掠夺者通过建立“联营”公司的方式，攫取了更大的利润，而智利方面却大量出让了国家资源和民族权益，并且为投资于“联营”公司而增加了外债，减少了税收。这样，加重了智利经济情况的恶化。据统计，在一九六七年六月，智利外债已经达到十六亿六千七百万美元，而到今年四月，进一步增加到二十亿美元。在去年一年中，智利货币贬值了百分之三十二；而今年至五月上旬为止，已再次贬值了九次。智利物价不断上涨。
    正是在这种情况下，智利各个行业的几十万名工人、职员、教员，特别是美国企业的智利工人，从今年三月中旬起掀起了大规模的罢工浪潮。到目前为止，这个斗争仍在持续中。同时，一些智利中小民族工商业由于受到美国垄断资本的排挤和打击，他们的反抗情绪也在增长。当前，智利工人阶级反压迫、反剥削的斗争正在不断发展，促进了智利广大工人和其他各阶层人民的新觉醒。智利《斯巴达克》报最近在一篇谴责美帝国主义对智利进行掠夺的文章中说：“我们智利劳动者应该团结得象钢铁一样，坚决斗争，反对以美帝国主义和本国垄断集团为首的剥削者，反对他们打入劳动者中间的代理人。智利劳动者的命运取决于这个斗争，而且也只能取决于这个斗争。”
