The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to achieving overall victory, the more complex and profound the class struggle becomes. The fallen dogs are always trying to crawl back to the shore to bite people again. We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions:

It is advisable to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength and not seek fame by imitating Xiang Yu

Ding Youjun, a platoon leader and recipient of the first-class merit citation

For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev has been vigorously promoting the theory of the extinction of class struggle, claiming that "the enemy has been almost eliminated" and "the counter-revolution has been almost resolved." "We have achieved overall victory in the class struggle... capitalists, landlords, and rich peasants will all enter socialism." This is a complete distortion of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will make their last struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will try to restore capitalism in China every day and every hour." Over the past decade, especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, numerous shocking facts of class struggle have powerfully proven the invincible truth of Chairman Mao's teachings.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians have exposed a handful of traitors, spies, die-hard capitalist-roaders, and counter-revolutionaries, and the situation is better than ever. However, the class enemies have not stopped their sabotage and disruption just because "everyone is watching them." Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Class enemies will definitely look for opportunities to express themselves. They are not willing to accept the loss of their country and communism. No matter how much the Communist Party warns in advance and publicly tells its enemies the fundamental strategic line, the enemy will still attack." The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to achieving overall victory, the more complex and profound the class struggle becomes. Although the class enemies have become fallen dogs, they are not yet "dead tigers." They may be few in number, but their political influence is not small. They will use every means, in various forms, and utilize their original influence to either openly or secretly counterattack the proletariat. They will try every means to jump back on shore, bite back, reverse the verdict, and restore the old order. Therefore, we must not relax our vigilance. The Chinese Khrushchev's vigorous promotion of the theory of the extinction of class struggle is precisely to relax our fighting spirit, making us forget that we are still in a long-term struggle against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and that we are still in a long-term struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. He wants the class enemies to come out in droves to restore the old order, which is extremely reactionary.

"Pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength and do not seek fame by imitating Xiang Yu." The Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of die-hard capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries are still alive and their hearts are not dead. Like wounded beasts, they lick their bleeding wounds and glare with red eyes, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack us. We must rise up with the mighty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of beating fallen dogs, and thoroughly defeat this handful of class enemies. At the same time, we must thoroughly smash the theory of the extinction of class struggle and cleanse the poison left by the Chinese Khrushchev in all aspects, politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

### 宜将剩勇追穷寇　不可沽名学霸王

    无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越复杂，越深刻。被打落水的狗时刻都想爬上岸来重新咬人。我们坚决按照毛主席的指示办事：
    宜将剩勇追穷寇　不可沽名学霸王
    某部班长、一等功荣立者　丁有军
    中国赫鲁晓夫长期以来，拚命宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，胡说什么“敌人消灭的差不多了，……反革命已经解决的差不多了”
  “我们已在阶级斗争中取得全面的胜利……资本家、地主、富农都将进入社会主义”。这是彻头彻尾的反毛泽东思想的谬论。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”十几年来，特别是无产阶级文化大革命以来，大量惊心动魄的阶级斗争的事实，有力地证明了毛主席教导的这一颠扑不破的伟大真理。
    无产阶级文化大革命中，广大无产阶级革命派揪出了一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和反革命分子，形势空前大好。但是，阶级敌人并没有因为“周围的人都看着他们”而不破坏和捣乱。毛主席早已指出：“阶级敌人是一定要寻找机会表现他们自己的。他们对于亡国、共产是不甘心的。不管共产党怎样事先警告，把根本战略方针公开告诉自己的敌人，敌人还要进攻的。”无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级斗争也就越复杂、越深刻。那些阶级敌人虽然已经成了落水狗，但还不是“死老虎”。他们人数不多，政治能量却不小。他们将竭尽一切手段，采取各种形式，利用原有的影响，或公开地，或隐蔽地向无产阶级进行反攻倒算。他们千方百计地要跳上岸来，反咬一口，要翻案，要复辟。因此，我们决不能放松警惕。中国赫鲁晓夫极力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，其险恶用心就是要松懈我们的斗志，让我们忘记我们正在继续同资产阶级和一切剥削阶级作长期的斗争，忘记我们正在继续同国民党反动派作长期的斗争。他妄图让阶级敌人纷纷出笼，复辟翻天，真是反动透顶。
      “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”中国赫鲁晓夫及一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务和反革命分子，他们人还在，心不死。他们象受伤的野兽一样，用舌头舔着流血的伤口，瞪着发红的眼睛，正在等待时机，向我们反扑过来。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，发扬痛打落水狗的精神，把这一小撮阶级敌人彻底打倒。同时，要彻底粉碎“阶级斗争熄灭”论，从政治上、思想上、理论上肃清中国赫鲁晓夫在各个方面的流毒。
