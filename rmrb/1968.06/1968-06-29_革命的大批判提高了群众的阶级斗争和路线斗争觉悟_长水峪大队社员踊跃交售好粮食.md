The revolutionary criticism has significantly raised the masses' awareness of class struggle and line struggle. The peasants of Changshuiyao Brigade enthusiastically sell high-quality grain to the state.

	The People's Daily reports: During the wheat harvest in Changshuiyao Brigade, Beijing Municipality, Changping County, Maotou Commune, with the enthusiastic assistance of the army supporting agriculture, the brigade focused on revolutionary criticism. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have significantly raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, correctly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual.

	Changshuiyao Brigade is located at the foot of the Yan Mountains and is a poor valley often plagued by drought. Since last winter and this spring, there has been little rain or snow in this area. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They dug wells, opened canals, and irrigated, without counting work points or rewards, using their red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao to overcome various difficulties brought by the drought. This year, the wheat harvest was excellent.

	After the wheat harvest began, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants continued to carry out revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing the "work points in command" and "material incentives" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents during the summer and autumn harvests in the past, thoroughly eliminating their poison. While exposing and criticizing the reactionary fallacies of "material incentives" spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, they also severely criticized the reactionary remarks made by a small number of class enemies in the brigade, such as "work points are the lifeblood of the peasants" and "contract work is fast, daily work is slow, and fewer work points mean less work done," etc. They angrily said: "The 'work points in command' and 'material incentives' promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev are aimed at protecting private ownership and maintaining private interests. They are intended to use these fallacies as bait to make us focus only on personal and immediate interests, forgetting collective and long-term interests, and forgetting the fundamental direction of the socialist road. We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao the most, and our determination to follow the socialist road is the greatest. We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end." Old peasant Li Degui said: "The 'three freedoms and one contract,' 'work points in command,' and 'material incentives' promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev are actually making us engage in individual farming, suffer twice, and endure twice the hardship." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants also used a large number of irrefutable facts to accuse and criticize the crimes of "work points in command" and "material incentives" that caused disunity among the peasants and between the cadres and the masses, and disrupted collective production.

	The army supporting agriculture, in response to the class enemies' cries of "rely on the mountains to eat from the mountains, rely on the water to eat from the water, and farmers should eat more grain," linked these reactionary remarks with the fallacies of "work points in command" and "material incentives" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. They mobilized the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to conduct a deeper analysis and criticism. During the criticism, the poor and lower-middle peasants recalled the bitterness of the old society, spoke of the sweetness of the new society, and talked about the happy road that Chairman Mao led the peasants from mutual aid teams, cooperatives to people's communes. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would not "let farmers eat more grain," but should remember the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the state when there is a good harvest.

	The revolutionary criticism was carried out more deeply, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants became higher and higher. To fight the summer harvest battle, they worked together, harvesting one plot at a time, threshing one plot at a time, and doing a thorough job of harvesting and threshing, ensuring that every grain is collected. The poor and lower-middle peasants also passed resolutions to seriously implement the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "consider the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual," selling the best grain to the state to support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    革命的大批判提高了群众的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟
    长水峪大队社员踊跃交售好粮食
    本报讯　北京市昌平县桃洼公社长水峪大队麦收中，在支农解放军的热情帮助下，狠抓革命大批判，广大贫下中农的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟有了显著提高，正确处理了国家、集体、个人三者关系。
    长水峪大队座落在燕山脚下，是个常闹干旱的穷山沟。去冬今春以来，这个地方很少雨雪，广大贫下中农积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，打井开渠、引水灌溉，不讲工分、不计报酬，用忠于毛主席的颗颗红心，战胜了由于干旱带来的各种困难，今年小麦获得了好收成。
    麦收开始以后，广大贫下中农坚持开展革命的大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人过去在夏收、秋收中推行的“工分挂帅”“物质刺激”等黑货，彻底肃清其流毒。在大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫“物质刺激”等反动谬论的同时，他们还狠批了本队一小撮阶级敌人散布的反动言论，如“工分工分社员的命根”“包工快、日工磨，工分少了不干活”等等。他们愤怒地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫推行的‘工分挂帅’‘物质刺激’就是为了保护私有制，维护私有观念，就是企图利用这些谬论作诱饵，使我们只注意个人利益和眼前利益，忘记集体利益和长远利益，忘记走社会主义道路的根本方向。我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，走社会主义道路的决心最大，我们坚决紧跟毛主席革命到底。”贫农老大爷李德贵说：“中国赫鲁晓夫推行的‘三自一包’‘工分挂帅’‘物质刺激’，实际上就是让我们搞单干、吃二遍苦、受二遍罪。”广大贫下中农还以大量无可辩驳的事实控诉和批判了“工分挂帅”“物质刺激”造成社员之间、干群之间不团结和破坏集体生产的罪行。
    支农解放军针对阶级敌人叫嚷的“靠山吃山、靠水吃水，种田的应该多吃粮”等反动言论，联系中国赫鲁晓夫的“工分挂帅”“物质刺激”等谬论，发动广大贫下中农进行了更深一步的分析批判。在批判中，贫下中农忆旧社会的苦，讲新社会的甜，大讲毛主席领导农民从互助组、合作社到人民公社所走的幸福道路。大家一致表示，决不能“种田的应该多吃粮”，而是应该丰收不忘共产党，丰收不忘毛主席，丰收不忘国家。
    革命大批判越搞越深入，广大贫下中农的革命热情越来越高。为了打好夏收这一仗，他们齐心协力，熟一块，收一块，打一块，做到精收细打、颗粒归仓。贫下中农还通过决议，认真贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“兼顾国家、集体、个人三方面的利益”的伟大指示，把上好的粮食交售给国家，支援无产阶级文化大革命。　（晨阳）
