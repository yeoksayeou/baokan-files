The fascist military regime in Indonesia, facing both internal and external difficulties and having no way out, is further intensifying the sale of national interests and sovereignty. It is opening its doors wider to the monopolistic capital of imperialist countries, rapidly turning the beautiful and rich archipelago into a colony of imperialism led by the United States.

According to reports, to allow the monopolistic capital of imperialist countries led by the United States to flood into Indonesia, after enacting a so-called "Foreign Investment Law" in December 1966 and signing a so-called "Agreement on Guaranteeing Private Foreign Investment in Indonesia" with U.S. imperialism in January 1967, the Indonesian fascist military regime recently passed another law selling national sovereignty, the so-called "Law on Protecting Foreign Investors." According to this "law," all illegal actions by foreign capitalists in Indonesia are beyond the jurisdiction of the Indonesian people and must be "resolved through international arbitration." This "law" has opened the door wider for the influx of foreign monopolistic capital into Indonesia.

Due to the series of sellout policies implemented by the Indonesian fascist military regime, the tentacles of imperialist monopolistic capitalists have already reached every corner of Indonesia, seizing large quantities of mineral resources and vast forests from Sumatra to West Irian, and controlling Indonesia's finance as well as industry, transportation, and other sectors. Currently, more and more foreign capital is continuously infiltrating Indonesia. According to a recent disclosure by the Indonesian official mouthpiece, the Antara News Agency, in the first five months of this year alone, the total amount of foreign capital invested in Indonesia reached over $150 million, with investment projects including mining, industry, forestry, fisheries, aviation, transportation, and construction, totaling 36 items.

The Indonesian reactionary regime also sells national interests by returning foreign enterprises, which were taken over by the previous Indonesian government under strong public demand, to their original owners. According to the Indonesian "Torch of the Poor" newspaper, most of the foreign enterprises previously taken over by the Indonesian government have now been returned to foreign capitalists. The plantations operated by foreigners during the anti-"Malaysia" period are also gradually being returned to their original owners, resulting in 60% of the plantations nationwide now owned by foreign capitalists.

The sellout policies of the Indonesian fascist military regime have further exposed their despicable faces as faithful dogs of imperialism to the Indonesian people, which will inevitably provoke stronger resistance from the revolutionary people of Indonesia. The more the Indonesian reactionary regime relies on imperialism led by the United States, the sooner its doom will come.

    内外交困　走投无路　大开门户　卖国求援
    印尼法西斯政权加紧拍卖主权
    新华社二十三日讯 雅加达消息：印尼法西斯军人政权在内外交困、走投无路的情况下，正在变本加厉地出卖民族利益和国家主权，对帝国主义国家的垄断资本更大地敞开门户，把美丽富饶的千岛之国加速沦为以美国为首的帝国主义的殖民地。
    据报道，印尼法西斯军人政权为了使以美国为首的帝国主义国家的垄断资本大量地侵入印尼，在继一九六六年十二月制订一项所谓“外国投资法案”、一九六七年一月同美帝国主义签订所谓“关于保证外国在印度尼西亚私人投资的协定”之后，最近又通过了一项出卖国家主权的所谓“关于保护外国投资者法案”。根据这个“法案”，外国资本家在印尼的一切不法行为，印尼人民无权处理，而是要“通过国际仲裁来解决”。这个“法案”为外国垄断资本涌入印尼更大地敞开了门户。
    由于印尼法西斯军人政权推行一系列的卖国政策，帝国主义国家垄断资本家的魔爪已伸到印尼各个角落，攫取了从苏门答腊到西伊里安的辽阔国土上的大量矿藏和大片森林，控制了印尼的金融以及工业、交通运输等部门。目前越来越多的外国资本不断渗入印尼。据印尼官方喉舌安塔拉通讯社最近透露，仅今年一至五月，外国资本在印尼的投资总额就达一亿五千多万美元，投资项目包括矿业、工业、森林、渔业、航空、交通和建筑等共计三十六项。
    印尼反动政权还出卖民族利益，把前印尼政府在人民强烈要求下接管的外国企业陆续归还原主。据印尼《贫民火炬报》透露，过去由前印尼政府接管的外国企业，目前大部分已退还外国资本家；在对抗“马来西亚”期间接管的由外国人经营的种植园，也在逐步退还原主，致使全国百分之六十的种植园已归外国资本家所有。
    印尼法西斯军人政权的卖国政策，在印尼人民面前进一步暴露了它们充当帝国主义忠实走狗的可憎嘴脸，从而必将激起印尼革命人民更强烈的反抗。印尼反动政权越是投靠以美国为首的帝国主义，它的末日也就会越早来临。
