Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and driven by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Jiangxi's industrial and agricultural production has seen significant progress, with a flourishing scene everywhere.

Since the beginning of this year, the province's industrial production has been steadily increasing month by month. In May, the total industrial output value increased by 19.3% compared to April, with 23 major products seeing significant increases. In the first half of June, the production of major industrial products continued to rise sharply. Heavy industries such as coal, steel, and non-ferrous metal mining have seen substantial increases. The electricity, machinery, chemical, textile, and transportation sectors have all seen new developments in production.

Building on last year's agricultural bumper harvest, this year's 400,000 mu of spring crops have also seen a bumper harvest. Wheat, rapeseed, and other crops have generally increased by about 10% compared to last year. The growth of early and mid-season rice is better than any other year, and the early rice is already ripe. If there are no major natural disasters, a bumper harvest is assured. Cotton has generally seen good seedlings and full coverage. Sugar cane, peanuts, hemp, and other economic crops are also growing well. The province's forestry, fisheries, and livestock industries have all seen new developments.

"Navigating the vast ocean requires a helmsman; making a revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought." The overall significant progress seen in Jiangxi's industrial and agricultural production lines is the result of Mao Zedong Thought becoming more deeply ingrained in people's hearts and the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The provincial revolutionary committees have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, organized tens of thousands of people into "three-in-one" Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go to the mountains, countryside, factories, and mines, making every effort to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have armed the broad revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, greatly enhancing the masses' awareness of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. The various levels of revolutionary committees have firmly led the broad revolutionary masses to seize the revolution and promote production, making new contributions to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres on the industrial and agricultural fronts in the province, nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought, have undergone tremendous changes in their spiritual outlook. They have resolutely responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp the revolution and promote production" and "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, emphasizing proletarian politics, using the revolution to drive production, and voluntarily and bravely shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production. They strive to be pioneers in seizing the revolution and models in promoting production. The Ganzhou region has held 79,800 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 2.23 million participants, effectively promoting revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. The entire region's industrial and agricultural production has seen a flourishing scene. The workers of the Pingxiang Coal Mine, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, have, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, seriously implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, seized class struggle, and since this year, have completed the coal production plan month after month, setting new high-yield records. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xingguo County have continuously launched new high tides in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, extensively carrying out the learning from Dazhai movement, embodying the spirit of self-reliance, extensively repairing small-scale water conservancy projects, and vigorously carrying out agricultural construction, achieving a bumper harvest of spring crops, and making early rice production better than any other year, becoming a model for the entire province to learn from and catch up with.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The various levels of revolutionary committees in Jiangxi, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, have led the broad revolutionary masses to launch fierce attacks on the class enemies, firmly, accurately, and fiercely striking a small handful of class enemies, exposing those class enemies hiding or infiltrating the revolutionary ranks, and smashing their criminal activities of disrupting the revolution and production. They have strengthened proletarian dictatorship, greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses, and promoted the revolution and production. The Nanchang Steel Plant Revolutionary Committee has fully mobilized the broad revolutionary masses, exposing a small handful of class enemies engaged in clandestine sabotage activities, implementing mass dictatorship over them, greatly enhancing the broad revolutionary masses' class struggle awareness, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses. The entire plant's steel and steel product output has exceeded the state plan month after month.

"The key to breaking is to criticize, to revolutionize. To break, one must reason, and reasoning is to establish. With breaking as the priority, establishing is also within it." The various levels of revolutionary committees in Jiangxi have remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, leading the broad revolutionary masses to deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents, and firmly establishing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Through a thorough criticism of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "material incentives," "experts running factories," "business first," "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms," and "exploitation is beneficial" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods, they have become more determined to take the socialist road, more firmly emphasizing proletarian politics, and firmly implementing political leadership, using the revolution to lead production. This has effectively changed the past situation of seeing things but not people, relying on material incentives, and a few people coldly and silently running production. Through revolutionary criticism, various places have better implemented the development of industrial and agricultural production relying on Mao Zedong Thought, political leadership, human factors, and the mass line.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses." The members of the various levels of revolutionary committees in Jiangxi, in leading the broad revolutionary masses to seize the revolution and promote production in the great struggle, have remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, "being both an official and a common person," deeply connecting with the masses, deeply engaging in practical work, deeply engaging in the front lines of production, carrying forward the Party's fine tradition of hard work, plain living, and close connection with the masses. They have lived, worked, and labored with the broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, learning from them, and humbly being students of the masses, conducting investigations and research, implementing the working method of going to the masses and returning to the masses, further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses. The heads of the Nancheng County and various commune revolutionary committees do not have fixed offices, using backpacks as desks, propagating Mao Zedong Thought wherever they go; wherever the problems are the most, the difficulties are the greatest, and the struggles are the most complex and acute, they appear there, fighting side by side with the revolutionary masses.

"Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." The great achievements on the industrial and agricultural production fronts in the province are inseparable from the strong support of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jiangxi, and are inseparable from the hard and meticulous work of the broad cadres and soldiers fighting on the "three supports and two militaries" front lines and participating in the revolutionary committees. The broad cadres and soldiers, with unbounded loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao's revolutionary line, taking Li Wenzhong and Men Hetong as examples, have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, resolutely supporting and protecting the broad leftist masses, resolutely supporting and safeguarding the newly born revolutionary committees, and persistently bringing the fine traditions of our army, such as high aloft the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, insisting on the four firsts, and carrying forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, to the broad masses of workers and peasants, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. The broad cadres and soldiers have also gone deep into factories and villages, living, working, and laboring with the broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses, playing a significant role in promoting the revolution and production, and further strengthening and consolidating the military-civilian relationship.

    在毛主席最新指示指引下　在无产阶级文化大革命推动下
    江西省工农业生产大步上升
    工业生产逐月上升，五月份总产值比四月份增长百分之十九点三，二十三种主要产品大幅度增产。春熟作物获得丰收，早稻中稻和棉花等作物都长势喜人
    据新华社南昌二十八日电　在伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和一系列最新指示的指引下，在无产阶级文化大革命强大推动下，江西省工农业生产出现了大步上升的新形势，到处呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象。
    今年以来，全省工业生产一月比一月上升。五月份工业总产值比四月份增长百分之十九点三，有二十三种主要产品大幅度增产。六月上半月，主要工业产品的产量继续直线上升。原煤、钢铁、有色金属矿等重工业生产，上升的幅度很大。电力工业、机械工业、化学工业、纺织工业和交通运输等部门，生产都有新的发展。
    全省在去年农业大丰收的基础上，今年四百万亩春熟作物又获得丰收。大小麦和油菜，普遍比去年增产一成左右。全省早中稻长势比任何一年都好，目前早稻已经黄熟，如无特大自然灾害，丰收是肯定了。棉花普遍获得了好苗、全苗。甘蔗、花生、黄麻等经济作物，也都长势喜人。全省林业、水产和畜牧业，都有新的发展。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”江西省工农业生产战线上出现的这种全面大步上升的新形势，是伟大的毛泽东思想日益深入人心的结果，是毛主席一系列最新指示全面落实的结果。江西省各级革命委员会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大办毛泽东思想学习班，组织数十万人的“三结合”的毛泽东思想宣传队上山下乡，下厂下矿，以最大的努力宣传毛泽东思想，贯彻和落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，用毛泽东思想武装广大革命群众，极大地提高了广大革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想的自觉性，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，促进人的思想革命化。各级革命委员会坚定地率领广大革命群众狠抓革命，猛促生产，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利作出了新的贡献。
    全省工农业战线上的广大工人、贫下中农和革命干部，在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，精神面貌发生了极大的变化。他们最坚决地响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大号召，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，突出无产阶级政治，以革命带动生产，自觉地、勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担，争做抓革命的闯将，促生产的模范。赣州专区办了七万九千八百多期毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的达二百二十三万多人次，有力地促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，促进了人的思想革命化，全区工农业生产出现了一派欣欣向荣的景象。具有光荣革命传统的萍乡煤矿工人，在革命委员会的领导下认真落实毛主席一系列最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争，今年以来月月完成煤炭生产计划，连创高产新纪录。兴国县广大贫下中农不断掀起活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的新高潮，广泛开展学大寨的活动，发扬自力更生精神，大修小型水利，大搞农田建设，使春熟作物获得丰收，早稻生产也比任何一年好，成为全省比学赶帮的样板。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”江西省各级革命委员会遵照毛主席的伟大教导，领导广大革命群众主动地向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，把隐藏的或混进革命队伍的阶级敌人挖出来，粉碎了他们破坏革命、破坏生产的罪恶活动，加强了无产阶级专政，有力地调动了广大革命群众的积极性，推动了革命和生产。南昌钢铁厂革委会充分发动广大革命群众，揪出了进行阴谋破坏活动的一小撮阶级敌人，对他们实行了群众专政，极大地提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争观念，调动了广大革命群众的积极性。全厂钢和钢材的产量月月超额完成国家计划。
    “不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”江西省各级革命委员会牢记毛主席的教导，领导广大革命群众深入持久地开展革命大批判，大破了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线，大立了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们通过狠批“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“物质刺激”、“专家办厂”、“业务挂帅”、
  “三自一包”、“四大自由”、“剥削有功”等反革命修正主义黑货，更加坚定了走社会主义道路的决心，更加坚持突出无产阶级政治，坚持政治挂帅，以革命统帅生产，有效地改变了过去见物不见人，靠物质刺激，靠少数人冷冷清清搞生产的局面。通过革命的大批判，各地都更好地做到了靠毛泽东思想、靠政治挂帅、靠人的因素、靠群众路线来发展工农业生产。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”江西省各级革命委员会成员，在领导广大革命群众狠抓革命、猛促生产的伟大斗争中，牢记毛主席的教导，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，深入群众，深入实际，深入生产第一线，发扬我党艰苦朴素、密切联系群众的优良传统，和广大工人、贫下中农同吃同住同劳动，拜他们为师，甘当群众的小学生，搞调查研究，贯彻从群众中来到群众中去的工作方法，进一步调动了广大革命群众的积极性。南城县和各公社革委会负责人都不要固定的办公室，用背包当办公桌，走到哪里就把毛泽东思想宣传到哪里；哪里问题最大、困难最多、斗争最尖锐复杂，他们就出现在哪里，和革命群众一道战斗。
      “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”全省工农业生产战线上的巨大成就，是和伟大的中国人民解放军驻江西省部队有力支持分不开的，是和奋战在“三支”“两军”第一线的广大指战员和参加革命委员会的军队代表的艰苦细致工作分不开的。广大指战员怀着对伟大领袖毛主席和毛主席革命路线的无限忠诚，以李文忠、门合同志为榜样，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，坚决地支持和保护左派广大群众，坚决支持和保卫新生的革命委员会，坚持不懈地把我军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、突出无产阶级政治、坚持四个第一、大兴三八作风等优良传统，带给广大工农群众，促进人的思想革命化。广大指战员还深入工厂、农村，和广大工人、贫下中农同吃同住同劳动，调动广大革命群众的积极性，对推动革命和生产起了重大作用，并且进一步密切和巩固了军民关系。
