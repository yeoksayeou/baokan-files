Tanzania's President Julius K. Nyerere and his wife, along with other accompanying personnel, were accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Commander of the Air Force Wu Faxian, and Deputy Commander of the Beijing Military Region Zheng Weishan. Today, they visited and inspected the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of soldiers and officers.

When President Nyerere and other Tanzanian guests arrived at the military unit, the soldiers held high portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, portraits of President Nyerere, and waved the national flags of China and Tanzania. They lined up to welcome their friends from the fighting front of Africa. They repeatedly shouted, "Salute to President Nyerere!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania!" "Firmly support the anti-imperialist struggle of the Tanzanian people!" "Long live the unity of the Asian and African peoples!" "Long live the great unity of the peoples of the world!" "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times ten thousand!" The responsible comrades of the unit, Zheng Sangeng, Liu Zhitian, Chang Yu, and Zheng Zhong, walked forward to shake hands warmly with President Nyerere and other guests, expressing their welcome.

President Nyerere and other Tanzanian guests watched an aerial performance by the air force unit and had a friendly meeting with the pilots who participated in the performance. Subsequently, the Tanzanian guests visited the "Soldiers' Family Clay Sculpture Exhibition." This exhibition was created by the soldiers and cadres of this unit, who, with deep proletarian feelings for the great helmsman Chairman Mao, followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle" and created it during the process of carrying out class education. President Nyerere carefully observed a series of clay sculptures reflecting the bitter lives of the people's soldiers' families under the old society's exploitation and oppression. The soldiers of this unit and the children from the local primary school and kindergarten performed revolutionary songs and dances for the Tanzanian guests.

President Nyerere and his wife, along with other Tanzanian friends, visited and inspected a certain infantry unit of the Beijing Military Region. They listened to the soldiers' reports on their experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and watched the soldiers' live-fire shooting performance.

At noon, the Tanzanian guests had lunch with the soldiers.

Accompanying the visit were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qi Pengfei, Commander of the Air Force of the Beijing Military Region Luo Yuanfa, and Deputy Commander Li Jitao.

Yesterday, President Nyerere's wife and part of the president's entourage visited the Huangtugang People's Commune, Beijing Knitting Factory, and the Beijing No. 2 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works.
