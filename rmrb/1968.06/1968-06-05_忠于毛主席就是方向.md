The red sun shines on our hearts, and our blood surges like a tide. On June 3rd, our dearest red sun, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received our representatives. Dear Chairman Mao, we have longed for you day and night, greeting you with the morning sun and thinking of you under the North Star. Today, we finally saw you. No matter how eloquent the words of the world, they cannot express our love for you; no matter how beautiful the songs of the world, they cannot convey the revolutionary soldiers' loyalty to you. A thousand words and a thousand songs converge into the strongest voice of our era: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand long lives! A thousand hearts unite into a single wish: May you, dear Chairman, live forever! Live forever! Live forever!

"The ship of the sea relies on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Dear Chairman Mao, on this joyous day, how can we forget the decades of battles we have walked with you? Our unit, from nothing to something, from small to large, was nurtured by you. We, these poor children, have grown into revolutionary soldiers, all thanks to your loving guidance. From our personal experiences, we deeply understand a great truth: "Loyalty to Chairman Mao is the direction, and following Chairman Mao is victory."

Dear Chairman Mao, in those days of fierce battles, we followed you closely, faithfully executing your great strategic directives. Under your wise leadership and loving care, we developed from guerrilla units and independent regiments into field armies, first striking at Yuncheng and sweeping across southern Shanxi. Together with our brother units, we used "mud planes" to capture the city of Linfen, destroying the lairs of the bandits Hu Zongnan and Yan Xishan in southern Shanxi, defeating the enemy with inferior equipment. Without your wise leadership and military thought, there would be no victory in the Linfen campaign. The soldiers of the "Linfen Regiment" have sworn to you with iron will: We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and carry the revolution to the end!

Dear Chairman Mao, you taught us: "The correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed, but are produced and developed through struggle." Indeed, that is the case. The counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan desperately promoted the bourgeois military line, attempting to make our unit deviate from your proletarian military line. We followed your teachings and the instructions of your close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, firmly emphasizing proletarian politics, launching a mass movement to study and apply your brilliant thoughts, and resolutely resisting and criticizing the bourgeois military line, further raising our awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

Dear Chairman Mao, you recently taught us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." In the past year and more of our "three-in-one" and "two-military" work, we deeply felt that to be loyal to you and follow you, we must study, apply, and fully implement your latest directives. At this critical moment of the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the Nanjing area, just as we accepted the arduous battle tasks in the past, we followed your strategic deployment, with the revolutionary spirit of "defeating all enemies" and "pursuing the fleeing enemy," together with the broad revolutionary masses, braved the storms and waves, smashed the interference and attacks from the right and the ultra-"left" by the class enemies, and underwent new and severe tests in the struggle.

Dear Chairman Mao! In the midst of the triumphant songs of the billion military and civilian people across the country following your great strategic deployment to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you personally decided to let us come to your side to learn, directly receiving your latest directives. This is your greatest care, greatest trust, greatest encouragement, and greatest spur for us. We will not disappoint your sincere expectations and will definitely follow your great strategic deployment, bringing your latest directives back to the unit and implementing them in practical actions. We are determined, like Comrade Deng Zihui, to think of you in everything, serve you in everything, follow you in everything, and do everything for you, seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in politics, ideology, organization, and economy.

    忠于毛主席就是方向
    南京部队活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体　“临汾旅”全体同志
    红日照心头，热血如潮涌。六月三日，我们心中最红最红的红太阳、我们最敬爱的伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席接见了我们的代表。敬爱的毛主席，我们日日想，夜夜盼，天天迎着朝霞祝福您，夜夜望着北斗星想念您，今天终于见到了您。用尽世界上最好的话儿，也难以表达我们热爱您的激情；唱尽世界上最美的歌儿，也难以道出革命战士忠于您的心声。千言万语，千歌万曲，汇集成我们时代的最强音：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！千万颗红心凝结成一个共同的愿望：敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。敬爱的毛主席，在这大喜的日子里，我们怎能忘记几十年来跟随您老人家所走过的战斗历程：我们部队从无到有、从小到大，是您老人家一手培育起来的；我们这些穷孩子能够成长为一个革命战士，是您老人家亲切教导的结果。我们从亲身体验中深深懂得了一个伟大的真理：“忠于毛主席就是方向，紧跟毛主席就是胜利”。
    敬爱的毛主席，在那战火纷飞的年代里，我们紧紧跟着您，忠实地执行了您的伟大战略方针，在您老人家的英明领导和亲切关怀下，我们从游击队、独立团发展为野战军，首战运城，横扫晋南。我们和兄弟部队一起，用“土飞机”攻克了临汾城，捣毁了胡宗南、阎锡山匪军在晋南的巢穴，以劣势装备战胜了优势装备的敌人。没有您的英明领导和军事思想的指引，就没有临汾战役的胜利。“临汾旅”的战士们向您立下了钢铁的誓言：永远忠于毛主席，将革命进行到底！
    敬爱的毛主席，您教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”事实正是如此。反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，拚命推行资产阶级军事路线，妄图让我们部队离开您的无产阶级建军路线。我们遵循您老人家的教导和您的亲密战友林副主席的指示，坚定地突出无产阶级政治，开展了活学活用您的光辉思想的群众运动，坚决抵制和批判了资产阶级军事路线，进一步提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    敬爱的毛主席，您老人家最近又教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”我们在一年多来的“三支”“两军”工作中，深深体会到：忠于您，紧跟您，就必须学好、用好、全面落实您的最新指示。我们在南京地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大决战的关键时刻，象当年接受艰巨的战斗任务一样，按照您老人家的战略部署，以“压倒一切敌人”和“追穷寇”的革命精神，与广大革命群众一道，顶狂风，战恶浪，粉碎了阶级敌人来自右的和极“左”方面的干扰和冲击，在斗争中经受了新的严峻的考验。
    敬爱的毛主席！在全国亿万军民紧跟您的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，您老人家又亲自决定让我们到您身边来学习，直接接受您老人家的最新指示。这是您老人家对我们的最大关怀，最大信任，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策。我们决不辜负您老人家的殷切期望，一定紧跟您的伟大战略部署，把您的最新指示带回部队去，落实到实际行动中。我们决心象门合同志那样，一切想着您，一切服从您，一切紧跟您，一切为着您，从政治上、思想上、组织上、经济上，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
