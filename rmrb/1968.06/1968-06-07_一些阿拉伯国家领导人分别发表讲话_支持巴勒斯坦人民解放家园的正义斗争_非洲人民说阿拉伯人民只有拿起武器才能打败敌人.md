Some Arab leaders have issued statements in support of the Palestinian people's just struggle to liberate their homeland on the first anniversary of the Arab people's resistance against the U.S.-Israeli aggression.

New China News Agency, June 6th: On the first anniversary of the Arab people's resistance against the U.S.-Israeli aggression, leaders of several Arab countries have issued statements expressing their continued support for the Palestinian people's just struggle.

Syrian President Ataa al-Sayed issued a statement on Damascus Radio and Television on June 5th, saying that in the face of the grave situation caused by the constant conspiracies of imperialism, the Arab people must redouble their efforts and sacrifices to wage armed struggle and liberate the land occupied by (Israel).

He said that the Palestinian cause is a matter concerning the future of the entire Arab nation. No Arab country or any other party can adopt a conciliatory attitude or take any steps that might lead to the elimination of the Palestinian question. He said, "As long as the Arab people are determined and persevering, they can continue the struggle and foil all attempts to eliminate the Palestinian question and achieve compromise."

Ataa al-Sayed said that the aggression last June was the result of a long-term conspiracy by U.S. and British imperialism and international Zionism. He pointed out that Israel is still carrying out aggression, and imperialist support for it is increasing and they are frantically hatching conspiracies. He said that Syria is working in all aspects to tap its potential for struggle and prepare for this long and arduous struggle.

South Yemen President Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi sent a telegram to the leaders of the United Arab Republic, Syria, and Jordan on June 5th, saying that South Yemen will continue to support the Palestinian people in their struggle to recover the Arab land occupied by Israeli aggressors. He called on the Arab people to launch a people's war until every inch of Palestinian land is liberated.

Yemeni President of the Presidential Council Abdul Rahman al-Iryani delivered a speech on Sana'a Radio on June 5th, calling for the unification of efforts and actions of all Arab countries to confront the threats faced by the Arab nation.

Sudanese Vice President and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ahmad Mahjub issued a statement in Khartoum on June 5th, saying that the Sudanese people and government are fully prepared to participate in the battle against the enemy, Israel.

Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, Jordanian King Hussein, and Lebanese Prime Minister Rashid Karami also issued statements on June 5th.

Arab League Secretary-General Mahmoud Riad said in Cairo on June 5th, "We should draw lessons from the setback of 1967." He called on the Arab nation to unite to confront the challenges of Zionism and imperialism and praised the heroic struggle of the Palestinian guerrillas.

According to New China News Agency, Cairo, June 5th: Basutoland Congress Party's representative in Cairo, Pakani Bokoto Kala, recently said in Cairo on the first anniversary of the Arab people's resistance against U.S.-Israeli aggression, "The Basutoland Congress Party strongly condemns the imperialist and Zionist aggression against the Arab people and reaffirms its firm support for the Palestinian people's pledge to liberate Palestine from the hands of imperialism and Zionism."

Kala hailed the heroic struggle of the Palestinian guerrillas against the Israeli aggressors. He said that the Arab people have realized that only through armed struggle can they liberate their land occupied by Israel. The heroic struggle of the Palestinian guerrillas in the occupied areas shows that the Arabs are determined to liberate their homeland and destroy the imperialist devil.

Kala said, "Chairman Mao pointed out: 'Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory.' The Arab people can only win the final victory by persevering in their just struggle."

A student from a West African country said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We are advocates of the annihilation of war, we do not want war; but war can only be eliminated by war, and if you do not want a gun, you must take up the gun.' This is a great truth. History has proven that only by taking up arms and defeating the enemy can the Arab people recover their occupied land."

The Palestinian people have repeatedly held demonstrations and marches to oppose the armed aggression by the U.S. imperialists and their tool, Israel, against the Arab countries. They have condemned the aggression of the U.S. and Israel and are determined to take up arms and wage armed struggle to liberate their homeland.

    他说，巴勒斯坦事业是关系到整个阿拉伯民族前途的事业。任何阿拉伯国家或其它方面都不能采取妥协态度或可能导致勾销巴勒斯坦问题的任何步骤。他说：“只要阿拉伯人民下定决心，坚持不懈，他们就能够继续斗争下去，并粉碎勾销巴勒斯坦问题和实行妥协的一切企图。”
    阿塔西说，去年六月的侵略是美英帝国主义同世界犹太复国主义势力长期阴谋策划的结果。他指出，以色列还在进行侵略，帝国主义对它的支持还在有增无已并疯狂制造阴谋。他说，叙利亚正在各方面进行工作，以发挥它的斗争潜力，为这场漫长而艰巨的斗争作好准备。
    南也门人民共和国总统沙比五日打电报给阿联、叙利亚和约旦国家元首说，在巴勒斯坦人民收复被以色列侵略者占领的阿拉伯土地的斗争中，南也门人民共和国将继续支持巴勒斯坦人民。他呼吁阿拉伯人民发动人民战争，直到最后一寸巴勒斯坦土地获得解放为止。

    据新华社开罗五日电  巴苏陀兰大会党驻开罗代理代表帕卡尼·博科托·卡拉最近就阿拉伯人民反抗美、以侵略战争一周年在开罗发表谈话说，巴苏陀兰大会党愤怒地谴责帝国主义和以色列犹太复国主义对阿拉伯人民的侵略，并重申它坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民要从帝国主义和犹太复国主义的手中解放巴勒斯坦的誓言。
    卡拉欢呼巴勒斯坦游击队同以色列侵略者的英勇战斗。他说，阿拉伯人民认识到，只有用武力才能解放他们的被以色列强占的土地。巴勒斯坦游击队在占领区的英勇斗争表明，阿拉伯人决心解放他们的家园，消灭帝国主义魔鬼。
    卡拉说，毛主席指出：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”阿拉伯人民只有坚持自己的正义斗争，才能赢得最后胜利。
    西非国家的一位学生说：“毛主席教导我们说：‘我们是战争消灭论者，我们是不要战争的；但是只能经过战争去消灭战争，不要枪杆子必须拿起枪杆子。’这是伟大的真理。历史证明，只有拿起武器打败敌人，阿拉伯人民才能收复被占领的土地。”（附图片）
