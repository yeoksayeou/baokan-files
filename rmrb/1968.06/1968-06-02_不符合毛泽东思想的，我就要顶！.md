Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group issued an order to posthumously award Comrade Men He with the honorable title of "Good Cadre Loyal to the End to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line," setting another brilliant example for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire nation. As a comrade who once fought and lived in the same unit as Comrade Men He, I feel extremely honored and proud.

In 1954, while studying at the Military and Political Academy, I met Comrade Men He. Later, from 1956 to 1958, Comrade Men He served as a platoon leader in our unit. Ten years have passed since then, but Comrade Men He's many heroic deeds of being infinitely loyal to the Party, infinitely loyal to the people, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death are still deeply imprinted in my mind. During the time we were together, Comrade Men He experienced serious struggles against the counter-revolutionary and anti-Party conspirator Peng Dehuai's bourgeois military line; experienced serious struggles in the socialist transformation of agriculture; experienced serious struggles in countering the rampant attacks by right-wing elements against the Party; experienced serious struggles in purging counter-revolutionaries; and experienced serious struggles against right opportunism. In these series of serious struggles between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, Comrade Men He always stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, bravely defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

When the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai promoted "regularization," "one-man command," "rank system," and a whole set of revisionist goods, Comrade Men He strongly opposed and resolutely resisted these things that completely violated Chairman Mao's military line. We still have a group photo taken during a field exercise eleven years ago. In the photo, everyone else is wearing epaulettes, except for Comrade Men He. I remember someone asked him, "Why don't you wear them?" He said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to learn from the glorious traditions of the Red Army and the Eighth Route Army. Now they are doing these nasty things, throwing away the traditions of the Red Army and the old Eighth Route Army of officer-soldier unity." This precious photo is a historical witness to Comrade Men He's resistance against the bourgeois military line and defense of Chairman Mao's proletarian military line. At that time, whenever there was labor, Comrade Men He often took off his epaulettes and put them in his pocket. Someone criticized him for having "guerrilla habits," but he defended himself boldly, saying, "Putting this thing on your shoulder, you can't carry it, you can't shoulder it, this is still alienating the masses!" Comrade Men He, with his selfless and fearless heroic spirit, bravely resisted the counter-current and fought against the evil waves, firmly defending Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, and steadfastly walking the road of emphasizing proletarian politics, giving us great education.

In the sharp and intense struggles between the two lines, no matter how great the pressure, how great the resistance, no matter how great the risk, Comrade Men He always stood firmly and bravely on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In 1957, Comrade Men He was labeled by some for resisting and opposing the bourgeois military line. However, he firmly replied, "No matter what, anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, I will resist! Even if I am stripped of my rank and sent home to raise pigs, I will follow Chairman Mao and revolutionize for life!"

Comrade Men He was able to consistently uphold and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, which is the result of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, demonstrating the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Men He had the deepest class hatred for the bourgeoisie and revisionism; he had the strongest love and deepest proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Being a sentinel who defends Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is Comrade Men He's most concentrated expression of conscious loyalty and thorough loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

"Countless martyrs have sacrificed themselves for the people's interests ahead of us, let us hold high their banners and march forward on their bloodstained path!" Comrade Men He's heroic sacrifice is a loss to our Party and also makes us lose a close comrade. However, he lives on even after death. With his glorious life, he fulfilled his oath to "stand guard for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, stand sentinel, and fight well." He set an example for us of a great communist warrior whose entire body shines with the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. I will definitely learn from Comrade Men He, like him, always thinking of Chairman Mao, always following Chairman Mao, always for Chairman Mao. Like him, be a loyal sentinel defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    “不符合毛泽东思想的，我就要顶！”
    门合同志生前战友、某部团长　古士秀
    我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准，中共中央、中央军委、中央文革发布命令，追授门合同志以“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”的光荣称号，为全党、全军、全国人民树立了又一个光辉的榜样。作为和门合同志曾在一个部队里战斗和生活过的战友，我感到非常光荣和骄傲。
    一九五四年在军政干校学习时，我认识了门合同志。后来，从一九五六年到一九五八年，门合同志在我们部队担任排长。到现在，十年的时间过去了，但门合同志无限忠于党，无限忠于人民，无限忠于毛主席，誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的许多英雄事迹，还深深地印在我脑子里。在我们相处的这段时间里，门合同志经历了与篡军反党大野心家彭德怀所推行的资产阶级军事路线的严重斗争；经历了农业社会主义改造的严重斗争；经历了反击资产阶级右派分子猖狂向党进攻的严重斗争；经历了肃清反革命分子的严重斗争；经历了同右倾机会主义的严重斗争。在这一系列的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的严重斗争中，门合同志始终坚定不移地站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边，英勇地捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。
    在反革命修正主义分子彭德怀推行“正规化”、“一长制”、“军衔制”等一整套修正主义黑货时，门合同志对这些完全违反毛主席建军路线的东西，进行了强烈反对和坚决抵制。现在，我们手头还保存着十一年前部队在一次野营途中拍的一张合影照片。照片上，其他同志都戴着肩章，唯独门合同志没有戴。记得当时有人问他：“你为什么不戴？”他说：“毛主席教导我们要学习红军、八路军的光荣传统。现在搞这些臭名堂，把我们官兵一致的红军、老八路的传统都丢了。”这张珍贵的照片，是门合同志抵制资产阶级军事路线、捍卫毛主席无产阶级建军路线的历史见证。那时候，每逢劳动，门合同志经常把肩章摘下来装在衣兜里。有人批评他是“游击习气”，他却理直气壮地说：“肩头挂上这玩艺儿，挑不能挑，扛不能扛，这还不脱离群众！”门合同志以他无私无畏的英雄气概，顶逆风，战恶浪，坚决地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级建军路线，坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，给了我们极大的教育。
    在尖锐、激烈的两条路线斗争中，不管遇到多么大的压力，多么大的阻力，不管冒多么大的风险，门合同志总是毫不动摇地、坚定勇敢地站在毛主席的革命路线一边。一九五七年，门合同志因为抵制和反对资产阶级军事路线，曾经被有的人扣了一些帽子，门合同志却坚定地回答说：“不管怎么样，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，我就要顶！就是罢了我的官，让我回家放猪，也要跟着毛主席干一辈子革命！”
    门合同志能够做到始终如一地坚持和捍卫毛主席的革命路线，这是毛泽东思想哺育的结果，显示了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无比威力。门合同志对资产阶级、修正主义的一套黑货有最深的阶级仇恨；他对伟大领袖毛主席，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，有最强烈的爱，有最深厚的无产阶级感情。当一名捍卫毛主席革命路线的忠诚哨兵，是门合同志对伟大领袖毛主席自觉的忠、彻底的忠的最集中的表现。
    “成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”门合同志的英勇牺牲，是我们党的损失，也使我们失去了一位亲密的战友。但是，他虽死犹生，他用自己的光辉一生实现了“为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗”的誓言，为我们树立了一个全身闪耀着毛泽东思想伟大光辉的、无私无畏的共产主义战士的高大形象。我一定要向门合同志学习，象他那样，一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。象他那样，做一名捍卫毛主席革命路线的忠诚哨兵。
