The brutal suppression by the ruling clique cannot deter the heroic children who dare to fight. Ten thousand French workers and students fiercely retaliated against police brutality. Workers and students fought side by side for the second consecutive day on the streets of Paris, bravely battling the police. Western news agencies exclaimed: The fashionable streets of central Paris have turned into a battlefield of flames.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated June 12, Paris: On June 11, ten thousand French workers and students bravely fought against the reactionary military and police in Paris for the second consecutive day. They strongly protested the police's killing of a student in the Paris suburbs on June 10, followed by the savage shooting of a striking worker on June 11. For the first time, the brave workers and students expanded their recent battles to the right bank of the Seine River in Paris's commercial district. From the Paris North Station to the Montparnasse Station in the south, from the Saint-Lazare Station in the city center to the Bastille Square in the east, one-third of central Paris became a scene of fierce clashes between demonstrators and military police. Western bourgeois news agencies exclaimed, "The fashionable streets of central Paris have turned into a battlefield of flames."

On the morning of June 11, in the eastern French city of Cholet, police attempted to forcibly enter the Peugeot automobile factory, which had been occupied by striking workers. They were met with resistance from the workers' picket lines. Enraged, the reactionary police opened fire on the striking workers, killing one. This new bloody crime by the French ruling class further enraged the French workers and students who were already in the midst of their struggle. That day, powerful protests erupted in many French cities.

In the capital, Paris, more than ten thousand workers and students gathered in several places, including the East Station and Pigalle Square, in the afternoon of June 11, and began a massive demonstration. The demonstrators held up red flags and chanted slogans such as "Down with the executioner government!" "We will avenge our comrades!" "Police are murderers!" They marched through the bustling streets of Paris. Along the way, they burned election campaign posters and ballot boxes used by bourgeois political parties to deceive the people, expressing their opposition to the electoral tricks used by the French ruling class to deceive the people. Workers and students engaged in a large-scale, brave, and clever struggle against the massive military and police forces sent by the authorities to suppress them. According to Western news agencies, "Six major conflicts broke out on both banks of the Seine," and "explosions and tear gas canisters could be heard in all directions."

The French authorities, in an attempt to prevent students from joining the workers in their struggle, mobilized a large number of police to occupy the square in front of the East Station, where students were preparing to gather, and blocked the exits of the nearby subway stations to prevent students from coming out. However, some students had already arrived at the East Station in small groups and immediately began to gather and march in protest. Students near the offices of the newspaper "Le Figaro" intercepted a delivery truck and burned the newspapers on the side of the road to protest the newspaper's biased reporting of the student movement. A group of Paris taxi drivers who were on strike also participated in this action.

When the students returned to the university district after their protest march, they were attacked by a large number of police who had been lying in wait, and the fighting became more intense. The students, on the one hand, occupied nearby buildings and used homemade Molotov cocktails and stones to counterattack the police from the windows and rooftops. On the other hand, they built dozens of barricades on the streets using felled trees, overturned cars, iron railings, and paving stones, fighting the police until the early hours of June 12.

In the early morning of June 11, Paris students also bravely surrounded and attacked the police station in the 5th arrondissement near the Sorbonne, burning a prison van and four other cars, and building barricades outside, forcing the police to retreat into the building.

Students in many other French cities also held protests against police brutality on June 11 and fought with the police. In the southern city of Toulouse, 2,500 students held a demonstration in the city center, destroying the offices of bourgeois political parties and building barricades in the streets to fight against the police who came to suppress them. In the coastal city of Saint-Nazaire, 500 students surrounded the police station after a protest rally. In Nantes and Lyon, students and workers also held marches and protests.

The revolutionary upsurge that workers and students in Paris and other major cities have launched over the past two days has made the already desperate French ruling class even more panicked. The French government held an emergency meeting on the morning of June 12 to plot deception and suppression measures. After the meeting, the French Minister of Information, Giscard d'Estaing, arrogantly announced that demonstrations would be banned throughout France during the so-called "election period," and some student organizations would be forcibly disbanded. However, the facts have proven that the French ruling class's naked suppression measures will never deter the French people who dare to fight. (Accompanying photo)

    统治集团的残暴镇压吓不倒敢于斗争的英雄儿女
    法国万名工人学生猛烈反击警察暴行
    工人和学生并肩战斗连续第二天在巴黎街头同警察英勇搏斗
    西方通讯社惊呼：巴黎市中心时髦的大街变成火光熊熊的战场
    据新华社十二日讯　巴黎消息：一万名法国工人和学生十一日连续第二天在巴黎街头同法国反动军警英勇搏斗，强烈抗议警察继十日在巴黎郊区杀害一名学生后，十一日又野蛮枪杀一名罢工工人。英勇的工人和学生第一次把他们最近展开的战斗扩展到塞纳河右岸的巴黎商业区，从巴黎的北车站到南部的蒙帕纳斯车站，从市中心的圣拉扎尔车站到东部的巴士底广场，巴黎市中心的三分之一地区都发生了示威者同军警的激烈战斗。西方资产阶级通讯社惊呼：“巴黎市中心时髦的大街变成了火光熊熊的战场”。
    十一日上午，在法国东部城市索肖，警察企图强行冲入已被罢工工人占领的普吉奥汽车公司在那里的工厂，遭到罢工工人纠察队的反击，反动警察恼羞成怒，竟向罢工工人开枪，一名工人被打死。法国统治集团这一新的血腥罪行，更加激怒了正在斗争中的法国工人和学生。当天，在法国许多城市爆发了强大的抗议示威。
    在首都巴黎，一万多名工人和学生在十一日下午分别在东车站、皮加尔广场等几个地方集合，开始举行了声势浩大的示威。示威者高举红旗，高呼“打倒刽子手政府！”“我们要为自己的同志报仇！”“警察是杀人犯！”等口号，穿过巴黎的闹市区。示威者沿途烧毁资产阶级政党竞选用的广告牌，烧毁投票箱，以表示他们反对法国统治集团用来欺骗人民的选举把戏。工人和学生同当局派来镇压的大批军警进行了大规模的英勇而机智的斗争。据西方通讯社报道，在巴黎“塞纳河两岸的六个地点发生了大冲突”，“在各个方向都可以听到轰隆轰隆的声音和催泪弹爆炸声”。
    法国当局为了阻止学生同工人一起斗争，调动大批警察占据了学生准备集会的地点东车站前的广场，并且堵住了车站附近地下铁道的出口，不让学生出来。但是有些学生已经事先分成小队到达东车站，并立即集会开始游行示威。学生在车站附近的《法兰西晚报》办事处截住一辆送报车，把车上的报纸拿下来在路旁焚烧，抗议这家报纸歪曲报道学生运动。一批正在坚持罢工的巴黎出租汽车司机也参加了这一行动。
    当学生们示威游行结束回到大学区的时候，受到了预先埋伏在那里的大批警察的袭击，斗争更加激烈。学生们一方面占据了附近的房屋，从窗户和屋顶用自制燃烧瓶和石子向警察还击，同时又在大街上用锯倒的大树、推翻的汽车、铁栏杆和铺路石等筑起几十个街垒，同警察战斗到十二日凌晨。
    在十一日清晨，巴黎学生还曾经英勇地包围并袭击了巴黎大学附近的巴黎第五区警察分局，放火烧毁了一辆囚车和另外四辆汽车，在外面筑起壁垒，打得警察龟缩在房子里不敢出来。
    法国其他许多城市的学生也在十一日举行了抗议警察暴行的示威，并且同警察进行了搏斗。在南部的图卢兹，二千五百名学生在市中心举行示威，他们捣毁了资产阶级政党的办事处，并且在街上筑起街垒，同前去镇压的警察进行斗争。在大西洋岸的圣纳策尔，五百名学生在一次示威集会后包围了警察局。在南特和里昂，学生和工人也举行游行示威。
    巴黎和其他大城市的工人和学生连续两天掀起的革命高潮，使本来已经焦头烂额的法国统治集团更加恐慌。法国政府在十二日早上慌忙举行会议，密谋欺骗和镇压措施。会后，法国宣传部长盖纳竟然蛮横地宣布，在所谓“竞选期间”，在全法国禁止举行示威，并且还要强制解散一些学生组织。但是事实已经证明，法国统治集团这种赤裸裸的镇压措施，决吓不倒敢于斗争的法国人民。（附图片）
