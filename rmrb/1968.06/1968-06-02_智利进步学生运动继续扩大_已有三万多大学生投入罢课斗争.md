The progressive student movement in Chile continues to expand. More than 30,000 university students have joined the strike struggle.

	New China News Agency, June 1st: A message from Santiago reports that the strike struggle initiated by students of the Philosophy and Education Faculty of the University of Chile to protest the persecution of progressive teachers by the school authorities continues to develop. According to reports, the number of university students participating in the strike struggle has now reached over 30,000, an increase of more than 10,000 from a few days ago.

	University students in the northern city of Antofagasta, following those in the capital Santiago and the main port city of Valparaiso, joined the strike struggle on May 28th.

	Currently, striking students at the University of Chile continue to occupy the school buildings. Progressive students hold mass meetings, strongly opposing the criminal actions of Chilean revisionists to sabotage this strike struggle. These traitors attempt to reach an agreement with the reactionary school authorities to extinguish the flames of the young students' just struggle.

	Progressive teachers at the University of Chile held a meeting on May 31st, firmly supporting the students' strike struggle. The attendees also unanimously condemned the reactionary measures of the school authorities and the sabotage activities of the revisionists.

	Senator Jaime Barros made a statement expressing support for the university students' strike struggle.

    智利进步学生运动继续扩大
    已有三万多大学生投入罢课斗争
    新华社一日讯  圣地亚哥消息：由智利大学哲学教育学院学生首先发起的、为抗议学校当局迫害进步教师而举行的罢课斗争继续发展。据报道，目前参加罢课斗争的大学生人数已达到三万多人，比前几天增加了一万余人。
    北部重要城市——安托法加斯塔城的大学生，继首都圣地亚哥和主要港口瓦尔帕来索城的大学生之后，五月二十八日也投入了罢课斗争。
    目前，智利大学罢课学生继续占领校舍。进步学生举行群众大会，强烈反对智利修正主义分子破坏这次罢课斗争的罪恶行径。这些叛徒妄图同学校反动当局达成协议，来扑灭青年学生正义斗争的火焰。
    智利大学进步教师五月三十一日举行大会，坚决支持学生的罢课斗争。与会者还一致谴责学校反动当局的反动措施和修正主义分子的破坏活动。
    参议员海梅·巴罗斯发表谈话表示支持大学生的罢课斗争。
