Recent days have seen intense anti-violence struggles by Black Americans in cities such as Richmond, Durham, and Denver, marking a new wave of resistance following the nationwide Black American anti-violence struggles in mid-April this year.

In Richmond, California, Black Americans engaged in fierce battles with fascist police over two consecutive nights on the 25th and 26th. On the evening of the 25th, police indiscriminately shot and injured a Black youth. This fascist atrocity incited widespread outrage among the city's Black community, who gathered from all directions to protest and demonstrate. They clashed with the police using stones and bottles, forcing the police to retreat in disarray. On the 26th, as the reactionary authorities summoned reinforcements from other cities, Black Americans split into multiple groups to fight the police across the city. Some armed Black Americans even fired back at the police. In one instance, Black Americans surrounded and seized a police car.

On the morning of the 27th, hundreds of Black Americans demonstrated in front of the housing management office in Durham, North Carolina, protesting racial discrimination. When fully armed police equipped with tear gas arrived to suppress the demonstration, the Black Americans built barricades using materials from nearby construction sites and engaged in fierce battles with the police. The situation is still developing.

On the 22nd, a fierce gun battle erupted between Black youth and police in Denver, Colorado.

Since the nationwide anti-violence struggles by Black Americans reached a peak in mid-April this year, the American ruling class has been terrified and enraged by the Black Americans' anti-violence struggles. On one hand, they instigate bought-out right-wing leaders among Black Americans to promote "legal and non-violent" paths. On the other hand, they have significantly increased the police force and conducted so-called "riot control training" for hundreds of thousands of National Guard and military personnel, attempting to use both counter-revolutionary tactics to extinguish the flames of Black Americans' anti-violence struggles.

However, the gunshots in Richmond, Durham, and Denver indicate that the flames of Black Americans' anti-violence struggles are indomitable. As class contradictions within the United States become increasingly sharp, the anti-violence struggles by Black Americans will undoubtedly surge even higher.

    美国一些城市黑人掀起新的抗暴斗争
    同警察展开激烈枪战使美国统治集团怕得要死
    新华社二十七日讯　华盛顿消息：最近几天以来，美国里士满、达拉姆、丹佛等城市接连爆发了激烈的黑人抗暴斗争，这是继今年四月中旬美国黑人全国大规模抗暴斗争之后出现的新的抗暴斗争浪潮。
    加利福尼亚州里士满市的黑人在二十五日和二十六日连续两夜在这个市的中心同法西斯警察展开了激烈的搏斗。二十五日晚这个市的警察无故开枪打伤一名黑人青年。警察的这种法西斯暴行引起了这个城市广大黑人的愤慨，他们从四面八方赶赴现场，举行抗议示威，并用石块和瓶子同前来镇压他们的警察展开激战，迫使警察狼狈逃窜。二十六日，当反动当局从别的城市召来大批增援警察时，黑人就分成许多批在全市到处同警察进行搏斗，各批黑人之间互相配合作战，有些带枪的黑人还向警察开枪还击，在一个地方，黑人还包围和截获了一辆警车。
    二十七日早晨，北卡罗来纳州达拉姆市的数百名黑人在市房产管理办公室前举行示威，抗议种族歧视。当携带催泪瓦斯的全副武装的警察前来进行镇压时，黑人们用附近建筑工地的材料筑起街垒，同警察展开了激烈的搏斗。目前局势仍在发展中。
    二十二日在美国中西部科罗拉多州丹佛市也曾爆发了黑人青年同警察的激烈枪战。
    自从今年四月中旬美国黑人掀起了全国性抗暴斗争的高潮以后，美国统治集团对美国黑人的抗暴斗争怕得要死，恨得要命。他们一方面唆使被收买的黑人中的右翼领导人，鼓吹“合法的、非暴力的”道路，另一方面又大量增加警察，并对几十万国民警卫队和军队进行所谓“防暴训练”，妄图加紧使用反革命的两手来扑灭黑人抗暴斗争的烈火。
    但是里士满、达拉姆和丹佛的枪声，表明美国黑人抗暴斗争的烈火是扑不灭的，随着美国国内阶级矛盾日益尖锐，美国黑人的抗暴斗争必将进一步高涨起来。（附图片）
