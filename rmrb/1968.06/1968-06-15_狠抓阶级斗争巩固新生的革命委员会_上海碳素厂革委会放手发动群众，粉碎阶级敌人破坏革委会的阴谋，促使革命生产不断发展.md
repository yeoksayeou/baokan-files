The revolutionary committee of Shanghai Carbon Factory has seriously analyzed the new trends in class struggle, mobilized the masses, and intensified class struggle. They have smashed the plots of class enemies to sabotage the revolutionary committee, united the broad revolutionary masses in the struggle, and further consolidated the new proletarian revolutionary power.

The struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in Shanghai Carbon Factory has always been sharp and complex. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the class enemies, unwilling to admit defeat, continued to stir up trouble and attempted to stage a comeback. The members of the factory revolutionary committee, while studying the new situation, new trends, and new characteristics of class struggle, seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie."

Chairman Mao's great teachings have armed the minds of the people. The factory revolutionary committee immediately mobilized the masses to conduct a thorough investigation of the enemy situation. They analyzed the phenomenon that during the previous period of struggle against the capitalist roaders, few people attended the meetings. Through investigation, they discovered that this capitalist roader, while appearing to be obedient, secretly used his black henchmen to spread rumors and malicious gossip among the masses, stirring up a rightist backlash wind, and viciously attacking the revolutionary committee for "deliberately excluding revolutionary cadres." Further investigation revealed that this capitalist roader had colluded with his black henchmen to deceive some of the masses who were unaware of the truth, establishing an underground "cadres' examination station" to attempt to "liberate" and "unite" this capitalist roader, overthrow the new revolutionary committee, and achieve a capitalist restoration. Through this investigation, not only was the movement of the class enemies uncovered, but the broad revolutionary masses were also educated. Many comrades said, "If you don't investigate, you won't know; once you investigate, you'll be shocked. The class enemies really want to change things!" This opened their eyes and boosted their morale. At this point, the revolutionary committee further organized the broad revolutionary masses to engage in face-to-face struggle against the class enemies, striking a heavy blow to the class enemies' attempt at a comeback.

In intensifying class struggle, the revolutionary committee of Shanghai Carbon Factory paid great attention to correctly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions and uniting the majority of the masses. After the capitalist roader's plot to seize power back was completely exposed, the revolutionary masses were outraged. They grew more and more resentful and more and more angry with this capitalist roader. Some revolutionary masses wanted to seize and struggle against those who were deceived by the capitalist roader and participated in the underground "cadres' examination station." At this time, the revolutionary committee promptly organized the revolutionary masses to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution, and it is also the primary question of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." They repeatedly propagated the Party's policies to the revolutionary masses, arming them with the Party's policies, making the revolutionary workers of the entire factory have a clearer target for struggle, uniting as one, and continuing to launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. The revolutionary committee paid attention to correctly handling the masses who made mistakes, both strictly demanding of them and patiently educating and warmly helping them. Through struggle, they sought unity. They held Mao Zedong Thought study classes and carried out heart-to-heart talks, fighting against selfishness and revisionism together with class brothers who were deceived and made mistakes, using Mao Zedong Thought to raise the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the masses who made mistakes, helping the masses who made mistakes to quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Because the revolutionary committee of Shanghai Carbon Factory seriously implemented Chairman Mao's instructions on struggle against the enemy, in this class struggle, they united the majority of the masses, struck at a handful of class enemies, greatly enhanced the prestige of the revolutionary committee, consolidated the new revolutionary committee, and the entire factory's revolution and production presented a very good situation.

    狠抓阶级斗争巩固新生的革命委员会
    上海碳素厂革委会放手发动群众，粉碎阶级敌人破坏革委会的阴谋，促使革命生产不断发展
    据新华社上海十四日电　上海碳素厂革命委员会认真分析当前阶级斗争的新动向，放手发动群众，狠抓阶级斗争，粉碎了阶级敌人破坏革命委员会的阴谋，在斗争中团结了广大革命群众，进一步巩固了新生的无产阶级革命政权。
    上海碳素厂的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争一直很尖锐、复杂，革命委员会成立以后，阶级敌人不甘心失败，继续兴风作浪，妄想复辟。革委会成员在研究阶级斗争的新形势、新动向、新特点时，认真学习了毛主席的最新教导：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”
    伟大领袖毛主席的教导武装了大家的头脑，厂革委会立即发动群众，认真清查敌情。他们根据前一个时期斗争走资派的时候，到会的人不多这个现象，发动群众一起来作调查研究，分析原因。经过调查，发现这个走资派表面上装得老实，暗中却通过他的黑爪牙到处在群众中煽阴风、点鬼火，散布流言蜚语，刮起了一股右倾翻案妖风，并且恶毒地攻击革委会“有心排挤革命干部”。继而一查，又发现这个走资派勾结了他的黑爪牙，蒙蔽一部分不明真相的群众，组织了一个地下“审干站”，妄图“解放”和“结合”这个走资派，颠覆新生的革委会，实现资本主义复辟。通过这一查，不但查明了阶级敌人的动向，而且也教育了广大革命群众。不少同志说：“不查不知道，一查吓一跳。阶级敌人真是想变天啊！”从而擦亮了眼睛，鼓舞了斗志。这时，革委会就进一步组织广大革命群众针锋相对地向阶级敌人展开面对面的斗争，狠狠地打击了阶级敌人妄图复辟的阴谋。
    在狠抓阶级斗争中，上海碳素厂革委会很注意严格区别两类不同性质的矛盾，团结大多数群众。这个走资派妄图反夺权的阴谋彻底暴露以后，革命群众群情激愤。他们对这个走资派越斗越恨，越批越气，有些革命群众就想揪斗受走资派蒙蔽参加了地下“审干站”的人。这时，革委会及时组织革命群众学习毛主席的教导：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。”反复向革命群众宣传党的政策，用党的政策武装群众，使全厂革命职工斗争目标更明确，团结一致，稳、准、狠地继续向一小撮阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻。革委会注意正确对待犯错误的群众，对犯错误的群众既严格要求，又耐心教育、热情帮助，通过斗争，求得团结。他们通过举办毛泽东思想学习班和开展谈心活动，和受蒙蔽犯了错误的阶级弟兄一起斗私批修，以毛泽东思想来提高犯错误群众的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，帮助犯错误群众迅速地回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    上海碳素厂革委会由于认真贯彻执行了毛主席关于对敌斗争的教导，在这场阶级斗争中，团结了大多数群众，打击了一小撮阶级敌人，大大提高了革命委员会的威信，巩固了新生的革命委员会，全厂革命、生产都呈现一片大好景象。
