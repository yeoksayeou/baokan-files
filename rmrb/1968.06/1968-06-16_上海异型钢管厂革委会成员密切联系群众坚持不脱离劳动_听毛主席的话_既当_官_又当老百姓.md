Members of the Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Special-shaped Steel Pipe Factory Maintain Close Ties with the Masses and Persist in Not Detaching from Labor

Listen to Chairman Mao's Words: Be Both an "Official" and a Common Person

They deeply root themselves among the masses. Wherever there are difficulties and the most acute contradictions, they fight there. They not only pay attention to uniting with those who share the same views but also are good at uniting with those who have different views to work together. The entire factory's revolutionary masses are full of vigor, and production has seen a new upsurge.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 15 — Members of the Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Special-shaped Steel Pipe Factory follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, maintaining close ties with the masses and deeply rooting themselves among the masses, making the Revolutionary Committee increasingly consolidated in the struggle.

Among the seven members of the Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Special-shaped Steel Pipe Factory, five are representatives of the masses. After taking power, their status has changed, but their working-class nature has not. Over the past year, they have followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an 'official' and a common person," persistently not detaching from production labor, and rooting themselves among the masses. Wherever there are difficulties, they fight there, and wherever the contradictions are the most acute, they appear there. Workers reflect that the current leaders are "officers in work clothes" and "officers who propagate Mao Zedong Thought at any time and place." After taking on the role of deputy director of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, carpenter Zhang Zhiran still goes back to his original team every morning to study Chairman Mao's works with all his colleagues. At work, he takes on the most arduous tasks. In hot weather, he always climbs onto the roof under the scorching sun to operate, and in cold weather, he always stands at the windy spot to work. Workers are willing to find him for big and small matters and ask him for help in solving them. Moreover, he uses his rest time to actively help workers repair houses and furniture. To this day, everyone still affectionately calls him "Zhang Carpenter." There is an old worker who serves as a member of the Revolutionary Committee, often fighting alongside workers day and night. Wherever there is a problem, he rushes there to discuss and solve it with the masses. One night, the blanks in the large workshop suddenly ran out of materials. If this was not resolved in time, the production of the next process would be seriously affected. According to the previous regulations, one must first apply to the production and supply departments and go through several procedures to resolve it. At this time, this member of the Revolutionary Committee was sleeping near the factory. Upon hearing the news, he rushed over, made an immediate decision, organized workers to pick up materials, and cast blanks, ensuring the smooth progress of production.

The members of this factory's Revolutionary Committee not only fight on the production frontline but also strictly demand of themselves everywhere, preventing special privileges. Usually, when the leading organs send some invitations to revolutionary art performances, they do not keep a single ticket for themselves but distribute them all to the workers. The director of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, Liu Guangde, lives with his family of four in a small room. Someone advised Little Liu to move into an empty room in the factory, but Little Liu replied, "Our rebellion is not for personal gain. There are still people more difficult than me, I cannot move." The members of this factory's Revolutionary Committee often use their holidays and spare time to visit workers' homes, understand their thoughts, and care about their lives. One member of the Revolutionary Committee, along with other comrades, visited over forty worker families in a short period. Revolutionary cadres participating in the Revolutionary Committee have also changed their previous bureaucratic style of detaching from the masses, often going deep into the workshops and workers' homes, and having heart-to-heart talks with workers, doing political and ideological work.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Believe in the majority of cadres and the masses, this is the most fundamental principle." The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Special-shaped Steel Pipe Factory follow Chairman Mao's teachings, not only paying attention to uniting with those who share the same views but also being good at uniting with those who have different views to work together. The members of the Revolutionary Committee say: "We are all on the same boat, and our goal is communism. We must unite our class brothers and walk the same path." There is a worker in the factory who does not follow labor discipline well and works slowly. The masses have many opinions about this comrade. For such a person, the Revolutionary Committee warmly helps him, criticizing his shortcomings, and at the same time patiently persuading and educating him, helping him improve his class consciousness and establish a sense of responsibility as the master. There is also a cadre who, in the early stages of the movement, executed the bourgeois reactionary line and was criticized by the revolutionary masses. For a period, he pushed work when he could and let others do it when he could. The Revolutionary Committee actively approached him, letting him participate in many Mao Zedong Thought study classes, helping him improve his understanding of the line struggle, making him realize the harm of the bourgeois reactionary line. Through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, this cadre realized that the broad revolutionary masses' resolute criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line is completely correct. From then on, his attitude towards the revolutionary masses changed, he dared to take responsibility for work, dared to fight against anarchist tendencies, and dared to resist and oppose behaviors that are not conducive to the revolution. Recently, to ensure the early implementation of the overhead crane, he has been fighting on the frontline day and night, playing a very good role.

Over the past year, the members of this factory's Revolutionary Committee have rooted themselves among the masses, using revolution to guide production, mobilizing the masses, and mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers. The entire factory's revolutionary masses are full of vigor, and production has seen a new upsurge.

    上海异型钢管厂革委会成员密切联系群众坚持不脱离劳动
    听毛主席的话　既当“官”又当老百姓
    他们深深扎根于群众之中，那里有困难，那里矛盾最尖锐，就战斗在那里。他们不但注意团结和自己意见相同的人，而且善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人一道工作。全厂革命群众意气风发，生产出现新高潮
    新华社上海十五日电　上海异型钢管厂革命委员会成员遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，密切联系群众，深深扎根于群众之中，使革命委员会在斗争中不断巩固。
    上海异型钢管厂革委会的七名委员中，有五名是群众代表，他们在掌权以后，地位变了，但是工人阶级的本色没有变。一年多来，他们遵循毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，坚持不脱离生产劳动，扎根在群众中，那里有困难，他们就战斗在那里，那里矛盾最尖锐，他们就出现在那里。工人们反映，现在的领导是“穿工作服的干部”，是“随时随地宣传毛泽东思想的干部”。木工张志然同志担任了厂革委会副主任后，每天一清早仍回到原来班组和全组同志一起学习毛主席著作。工作上也是拣最艰苦的担子挑。热天他总是爬到烈日暴晒的屋面上操作，冷天他总是站在寒风刺骨的风口干活。工人大小事情都愿意找他，请他帮助解决。不仅如此，他还利用休息时间，主动去帮助职工修房子、修家具，至今，大伙仍旧亲切地称他“张木匠”。有一个担任革委会委员的老工人，常常不分昼夜地和工人战斗在一起，那里有问题，就赶到那里去和群众一起商量解决。有一天夜里，大车间的毛坯突然断料了，如果不及时解决，下道工序的生产就会受到严重影响。按照以往规定，必须先向生产、供销等部门申请，经过几番手续才能解决。这时，这位革委会委员正睡在工厂附近，他闻讯赶来，当机立断，立即组织工人领料，冲制毛坯，保证了生产顺利进行。
    这个工厂的革委会委员不仅战斗在生产第一线，而且处处严格要求自己，防止特殊化。平时，领导机关发来一些革命文艺演出的招待票，他们自己一张不留，全部分给工人。厂革委会主任刘广德，一家四口人，只住一间小屋子，有人劝小刘搬到厂里的空房子里去住，小刘回答说：“我们造反不能为私，比我困难的人还有，我不能搬。”这个厂的革委会委员们还经常利用休假日和业余时间深入到职工家中去访问谈心，了解他们的思想，关心他们的生活。有一个革命委员会委员和其他同志一起在很短时期内就访问了四十多个职工家庭。参加革委会的革命干部也改变了以往脱离群众的官僚主义作风，经常深入车间和职工家庭，和工人促膝谈心，做政治思想工作。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“相信大多数干部和群众，这是最基本的一条。”上海异型钢管厂的革委会成员遵循毛主席的教导，不但注意团结和自己意见相同的人，而且善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人一道工作。革委会的委员们说：“我们乘的都是同一条船，目标都是共产主义。我们一定要把自己的阶级兄弟团结到一起来，走同一条路。”厂里有一个工人，不大遵守劳动纪律，工作拖拖拉拉。群众对这个同志意见很多。对于这样一个人，革委会满腔热情地对他进行帮助，批评他的缺点，同时耐心地对他进行说服教育，帮助他提高阶级觉悟，树立主人翁的责任感。还有一个干部，在运动初期执行过资产阶级反动路线，曾受到革命群众的批判。有一个时期，他工作能推则推，能让则让。革委会主动接近他，多次让他参加毛泽东思想学习班，帮助他提高路线斗争觉悟，使他认识到资产阶级反动路线的危害性。通过斗私批修，这个干部认识到，广大革命群众坚决批判资产阶级反动路线，大方向是完全正确的。从此，他对革命群众的态度有了转变，对工作敢于承担责任，对无政府主义思潮敢于斗争，对不利于革命的行为敢于抵制和反对。最近，为了使行车早日上马，他日日夜夜战斗在第一线，发挥了很好的作用。
    一年多来，这个厂的革命委员会成员扎根于群众之中，用革命统帅生产，放手发动群众，调动了广大革命职工的生产积极性。全厂革命群众意气风发，生产上出现了新高潮。
