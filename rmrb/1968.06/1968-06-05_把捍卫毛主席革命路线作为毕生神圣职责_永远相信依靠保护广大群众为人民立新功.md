The joyous news that our most beloved great leader and supreme commander Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received comrades from the PLA Mao Zedong Thought Cadres Training Class from the Nanjing and Shenyang regions, as well as comrades from the various general departments, military branches, and specialized conferences of the PLA Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes, has greatly inspired the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the PLA. They said with immense excitement: Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's cordial reception is the greatest care, greatest encouragement, greatest education, and greatest spur for all military and civilian personnel nationwide. We must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The soldiers and officers unanimously vowed before Chairman Mao's portrait: The sea may dry up, the rocks may crumble, but our loyalty to Chairman Mao will never change! The earth may quake, the mountains may shake, but our resolve to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line will never waver!

From last night to today, the training sites of the Nanjing and Shenyang regional military cadre classes and the leadership organs of the various general departments, military branches, and services were adorned with red flags and filled with songs of praise. Various units held grand meetings late into the night to celebrate and cheer the cordial reception by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin. The representatives who were received, with tears of excitement, reported the inspiring news to everyone: Our brightest red sun, Chairman Mao, was radiant and full of vigor, in extremely good health. At this moment, the entire venue erupted in joy. The soldiers and officers, with hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, shouted a thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" They sang a thousand times, "The East Is Red," "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman," and "Father and Mother Are Dear, but Not as Dear as Chairman Mao."

The old and new revolutionary warriors who were cordially received by the great commander Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin were immersed in boundless happiness. Veterans over fifty years old shouted joyfully and sang loudly; young cadres stayed up all night writing pledge after pledge. At the oath-taking rallies and celebration meetings held separately, representatives from the 1124 Project Hero Collective, the "Linfeng Brigade," Chairman Mao's good soldiers Lei Feng, Liu Yingjun, Cai Yongxiang, and the heroic warriors Dong Cunrui, Yang Gentang from their former units, the heroic warriors Huang Chouhe, Wang Lihua, Han Decai, and the active learners of Mao Zedong's works from the 3516 Factory and 3502 Factory of the General Logistics Department all vowed to Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao, we will definitely turn your reception into a great force. We will definitely take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, forever loyal to your revolutionary line, like Comrade Men He, "think of everything for Chairman Mao, obey everything for Chairman Mao, follow everything for Chairman Mao, do everything for Chairman Mao." We will take the firm execution and brave defense of your revolutionary line as our lifelong sacred duty. At this happy moment, many old revolutionaries, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." A responsible comrade from a certain air force unit, who has followed Chairman Mao in countless battles for thirty-nine years, firmly declared: We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, protect the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. We will truly be lifelong students of the masses, pull the cart for the masses for a lifetime, and be lifelong revolutionary "old oxen." The leaders of the "Sea and Air Eagle Regiment" wrote in their pledge to Chairman Mao: We will definitely better study and apply your brilliant thoughts, follow your great strategic deployment, fully implement your latest instructions, and in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, correctly treat the broad masses of the people, protect the masses of the people, and forever advance along your revolutionary line.

The joyous news of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin's cordial reception spread to the Nanjing regional troops, inspiring the broad masses of soldiers and officers, who eagerly shared the news and held various celebrations. In the early hours of June 3, over 40,000 troops from the army, navy, and air force in Nanjing held a celebration rally. Du Ping, the political commissar of the Nanjing regional troops, spoke. He said that Chairman Mao's reception encouraged us to temper ourselves into steadfast proletarian warriors and mobilized us to achieve new merits for the people in the struggle for a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. He urged the subordinate troops to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, accelerate the ideological and organizational revolutionization of the troops, and do a good job in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, turning the troops into a fiery red school of Mao Zedong Thought. In Shanghai, the army, navy, and air force held grand meetings and parades. The soldiers and officers, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," reported the good news to the revolutionary committees throughout the night. The soldiers and officers of the "Model Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" expressed with immense excitement that they would forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever follow Chairman Mao, and actively launch fierce attacks on class enemies, vowing to be the red guards protecting the revolutionary committees. The political commissar Zhang Yimin of a certain unit of the East China Sea Fleet and the soldiers of the Fourth Artillery Battery of a certain air force unit expressed in the celebration activities that they would definitely take Comrade Men He as an example, vowing to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death, fearing nothing even if they were to walk on swords or enter fires. The news reached the front line of the East China Sea, where the soldiers and officers of the "Model Company for Military-Civilian Cooperation" and the island's civilian population held celebration activities. The military and civilian population jointly expressed their resolve: Following Chairman Mao's teachings, further carry out "Support the Military and Love the People" activities, strengthen military-civilian unity, and vow to build the coastal defense into an iron wall defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In the Northeast region, the joyous news of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's reception inspired the broad masses of soldiers and officers. From the Yellow Sea front to the Songliao Plain, from Shanhaiguan to the banks of the Heilongjiang River, red flags were flying everywhere, and the atmosphere was one of great joy. Many units organized reporting teams to spread the joyous news on the streets. Some even staged artistic performances to propagate in factories and villages. The leadership organs of the Shenyang regional troops immediately held a telephone conference, requiring the subordinate troops to turn Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's cordial reception into a great force and push the great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights. The soldiers and officers of the "Model Red Ninth Company for Studying Chairman Mao's Works," upon hearing the news, were so moved that tears streamed down their faces. They gathered in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, once again studied the heroic deeds of Comrade Men He, and reviewed the glorious journey of this company from its establishment by Chairman Mao on Jinggangshan to becoming a nationally advanced collective for studying Chairman Mao's works. They said, all our achievements are due to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must better learn from Comrade Men He, so that every comrade can temper themselves into a steadfast warrior with a high consciousness of two-line struggle, and be a model of infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The heroic commander of a certain division, Zhao Xingyuan, who is fighting on the front line of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries," said with great passion, in the revolutionary war years, seeing Chairman Mao gave us boundless courage to fight the enemy; today, receiving Chairman Mao's reception, we have firm faith in defeating the enemy who does not hold guns, and can thoroughly smash all the plots of the class enemies. He expressed that in the great situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, he would definitely better believe in the masses, rely on the masses, lead the broad revolutionary masses, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly expose and criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and their agents, fight them down and make them stink, and root out the few traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries who hide in dark corners and cause trouble, further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Today, the troops stationed in various places across the country held grand celebration activities. The soldiers and officers resolved to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, advance victoriously, develop the great situation, and achieve new merits for the people in the struggle for a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.
