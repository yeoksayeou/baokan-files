Under the caring guidance of the Party of Labour of Albania and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, Albanian children are growing up happily. They are always ready to become reliable successors to the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Albanian children are actively participating in the revolutionary movement that is flourishing throughout the country. Following the initiative of two eight-year schools in Elbasan and Durres, children across the country are studying the teachings of the Party of Labour and Comrade Enver Hoxha, and actively engaging in the struggle against religious superstition and backward customs. The Young Pioneers say, "We are the flowers of our motherland, but we do not want to be flowers grown in pots and greenhouses. We want to be flowers that grow through struggle and overcoming difficulties, with healthy thoughts, loving the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, and our motherland."

In rural schools in Ferraj and Lushnje, class exhibitions are held, displaying the thatched huts, clothing, and simple tools of poor peasants before liberation, as well as charts showing the cruel oppression and exploitation of peasants by landlords. This educates the students on class struggle. Some schools also organize students to write family and village histories, comparing life before and after liberation, making the students love the Party of Labour, the motherland, and the people even more.

In areas like Fier, Young Pioneers have launched discussions on "For whom do we study? What do we study? How do we study?" Through these discussions, the Young Pioneers have clarified their study purposes and corrected their study attitudes.

While studying, the children also, under the guidance of soldiers and teachers of the People's Army, engage in activities such as mountain climbing, swimming, track and field, and military exercises. They learn to use various weapons, wireless communication, and first aid. They often visit old partisans from the National Liberation War and soldiers of the People's Army, listening to their stories about the National Liberation War and the current struggle against imperialism and revisionism. Young Pioneers living in border areas also stand guard with soldiers of the People's Army and members of agricultural cooperatives, vigilantly defending the socialist motherland's borders.

Albanian children, following the teachings of the Party of Labour and Comrade Enver Hoxha, are widely engaged in productive labor, learning various technologies, and conducting scientific experiments. Many schools have established farms and workshops for carpentry, metalwork, electricity, and wireless communication. Students repair school equipment, tidy up the school grounds, paint classrooms, and plant vegetables and grains. Students of the eight-year boarding school in Mshina village, Saranda district, work one day a week in the school's farm. Last year, they provided all the vegetables and part of the grains, meat, and dairy products. This not only saved the state expenses but also helped the students establish a correct view of labor and improve their practical knowledge and learning quality. This year, they aim to be fully self-sufficient in food.

Rural children actively participate in sowing, harvesting, and picking up wheat stalks during the busy farming season; urban children collect scrap copper, old wires, and used light bulbs to support the national rural electrification movement.

Children in Berat and Gjirokastra districts also use their spare time to learn from retired old stonemasons, paving city cobblestone roads.

At the beginning of last year, Comrade Enver Hoxha specially wrote a letter to the Young Pioneers of Berat, warmly praising their contributions to the socialist cause.

The Party of Labour of Albania and the government pay great attention to the all-around development of children in moral, intellectual, and physical education. Since the establishment of the people's government, eight-year schools, Young Pioneer palaces, summer camps, kindergartens, nurseries, and maternal and child health institutions have been continuously developing and improving.

    阿尔巴尼亚少年儿童正在幸福地成长
    积极参加革命化运动，决心做社会主义革命和建设的可靠接班人
    新华社地拉那二十九日电　在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志亲切关怀和教导下，阿尔巴尼亚少年儿童正在茁壮地成长。他们时刻准备着，决心做社会主义革命和社会主义建设的可靠接班人。
    阿尔巴尼亚少年儿童积极参加正在全国蓬勃开展的革命化运动。在爱尔巴桑市和都拉斯市两个八年制学校的倡议下，全国少年儿童开展了学习劳动党和霍查同志的教导，积极投入反对宗教迷信和落后习俗斗争等活动。少先队员们说，我们是祖国的花朵，但是，我们绝不做栽培在花盆和暖房里的花朵，要做在斗争和克服困难中成长、具有健康思想、热爱党和霍查同志的祖国的花朵。
    费里区和卢什涅区农村一些学校举办阶级展览会，展出解放前贫苦农民的茅屋、衣物和简陋的农具，以及地主残酷压迫和剥削农民的图表，对学生进行阶级教育。有些学校还发动学生写家史、村史，对比解放前后的生活，使学生更加热爱劳动党、祖国和人民。
    发罗拉等区的少先队员展开了“为谁学习？学什么？怎样学习？”的群众性讨论。通过讨论，少先队员们明确了学习目的，端正了学习态度。
    广大少年儿童在学习的同时，还在人民军指战员和老师的带领下，进行爬山、游泳、田径以及军事演习等活动，学习使用各种武器、无线电联系和医护急救等知识。他们还经常访问民族解放战争期间的老游击队员以及人民军指战员，听他们讲述民族解放战争和当前反帝反修斗争的故事。生活在边境地区的少先队员们还同人民军指战员和农业社社员们一起，时刻警惕地守卫着社会主义祖国的边疆。
    阿尔巴尼亚少年儿童还遵照劳动党和霍查同志的教导，普遍开展生产劳动、学习各种技术和进行科学实验等活动。许多学校开办了农场和木工、铁工、电工、无线电等工场。学生们自己动手修理校具，整理校园，粉刷教室，种植蔬菜和粮食。萨兰达区姆希纳村八年制寄宿学校的学生，每星期有一天在学校办的农场劳动。去年，他们自给了全部蔬菜和一部分粮食、肉类和奶类。这样，不仅为国家节约了开支，而且使学生树立了正确的劳动观点，提高了学生的实践知识和学习质量。今年，他们争取全部伙食自给。
    广大农村少年儿童在农忙期间积极参加播种、收割和拾麦穗等劳动；城市少年儿童开展了收集废铜、旧电线、废灯泡等活动，支援全国农村电气化运动。
    培拉特和吉诺卡斯特区的少年儿童还利用课余时间，向退休的老石匠学习，铺筑城市碎石马路。
    去年年初，霍查同志曾特地写信给培拉特市的少先队员，热情赞扬他们为社会主义事业所作出的贡献。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府十分关怀少年儿童在德育、智育和体育等各方面的成长。人民政权建立以来，八年制学校、少先宫、夏令营、幼儿园、托儿所和妇婴卫生等机构，正在不断发展和完善。
