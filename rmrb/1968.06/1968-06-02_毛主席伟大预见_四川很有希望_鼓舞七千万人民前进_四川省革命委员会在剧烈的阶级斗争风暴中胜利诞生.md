In the light of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, under the close concern and wise leadership of the headquarters of the proletarian revolution headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, joyous news has come from the southwest of our motherland: the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been born in the storm of class struggle. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! It is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Sichuan has 70 million revolutionary people and is a crucial strategic location in our great socialist motherland. The establishment of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a major event in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. It proclaims the complete failure of the evil plot by the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents to restore capitalism in the southwest and Sichuan. It marks the beginning of a new stage in Sichuan's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, dealing a heavy blow to all class enemies at home and abroad. This great victory is a great encouragement to the hundreds of millions of soldiers and people across the country who are advancing in victory to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Sichuan was once a stronghold of feudal warlords, American imperialism, and the reactionary Kuomintang. Since liberation, the Sichuan people have followed the great leader Chairman Mao and achieved tremendous successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Sichuan, Li Pingyuan, Liao Zhigao, Ren Baige, and Huang Xinting, representing the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, imperialism, revisionism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, have done everything possible to resist Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have crazily pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, attempting to turn Sichuan into an independent kingdom for restoring capitalism. The proletariat and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary bourgeois line have been in fierce struggle in Sichuan. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in the southwest and Sichuan regions, colluding with the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, ruthlessly suppressed the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, attempting to reverse their doomed fate.

The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin have always been deeply concerned about Sichuan's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At every critical moment of the struggle, Chairman Mao has given extremely important instructions. Chairman Mao's close concern and great teachings have given the 70 million revolutionary people of Sichuan great encouragement and boundless strength. The broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of "it is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries" and launched a swift and powerful attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in the southwest and Sichuan. Following the course of victory indicated by Chairman Mao, they have fought bravely, repelled the fierce resistance of the reactionary bourgeois line, and won a decisive victory in Sichuan's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At present, the revolutionary and production situation in Sichuan Province is excellent and getting better. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is unprecedentedly high. Mao Zedong Thought is unprecedentedly widespread, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions are further implemented. The 70 million people of the province are spirited and full of fighting spirit. They follow the great teachings of Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness for war," and have launched a new high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production.

On May 31, the capital of Sichuan Province, Chengdu, was immersed in the festive atmosphere of a grand celebration. Five hundred thousand revolutionary cadres and masses from all fronts in the province, along with soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, carrying the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and singing songs in praise of the great leader Chairman Mao, gathered from all directions to the People's South Road Square in the city center to celebrate the birth of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

The celebration meeting began with the entire audience singing the majestic song "The East Is Red." When the meeting solemnly announced the formal establishment of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the entire audience erupted in cheers, and the atmosphere was electric. People, filled with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, repeatedly raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China! Long live our most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

On this day of great joy in celebrating the birth of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, from the snow-capped mountains and grasslands to the Three Gorges, from the Daba Mountains to the banks of the Jinsha River, the 70 million revolutionary people of the province sincerely wish the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

"Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army participating in the celebration meeting were warmly welcomed by the entire audience of revolutionary masses. The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Sichuan have, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, enthusiastically responded to the great call of the great commander Chairman Mao to "support the leftist broad masses," firmly implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, actively helped the revolutionary cadres and masses to implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and used the great Mao Zedong Thought to propagandize, arm, and organize the masses. They helped them enhance their proletarian party spirit, oppose bourgeois factionalism, and powerfully promoted, consolidated, and developed the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. They made great contributions in the "three supports, two militaries" work and established immortal merits for Sichuan's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the celebration meeting, the revolutionary masses repeatedly shouted: "Learn from the People's Liberation Army! Salute the People's Liberation Army! Long live the great People's Liberation Army of China!"

Comrade Zhang Guohua, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the celebration meeting. He said, the establishment of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! It is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! He said, the establishment of the revolutionary committee is not the end of class struggle but the starting point of a new battle. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, guide the masses, unite all forces that can be united, organize a vast revolutionary army, and continue to launch a fierce attack on the enemies of the proletariat. We must resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism, smash the rightist reversal wind, deeply and thoroughly carry out the revolutionary criticism, expose and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents Li Pingyuan, Liao Zhigao, Ren Baige, and Huang Xinting, overthrow and disgrace them, and root out a handful of hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries to further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Comrade Zhang Guohua said, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, strengthen the construction of the revolutionary committee, "implement unified leadership, break down the overlapping administrative organs, streamline the bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." The revolutionary committee must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The revolutionary committee must fully mobilize the broad masses of the people to participate directly in state administration and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must maintain close ties with the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and build the revolutionary committee into a fighting command post that is politically prominent, full of revolutionary spirit, decisive, and powerful.

Comrade Zhang Guohua said, after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, there are countless tasks ahead. The most fundamental task is to lead the 70 million revolutionary people of the province to further study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and push the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new high. We must continue to run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize and repudiate revisionism, summarize the experiences of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years. We must learn from Comrade Meng Hanzhen, who is loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, learn from his loyalty to the people, the party, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and promote the thought revolutionization of the revolutionary people of the entire province.

Comrade Zhang Guohua said, to launch a more powerful attack on the class enemies and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of the people of the entire province must continue to consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. We must follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao and guide some cross-industry mass organizations to the track of revolutionary great alliance by system, by industry, and by class, and further unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Zhang Guohua said, Chairman Mao recently pointed out again: "We must believe that more than 90% of the cadres are good and relatively good. Those who have made mistakes can mostly be corrected." Various revolutionary mass organizations must further help more revolutionary cadres to stand up. All revolutionary cadres must correctly treat the masses and correctly treat themselves and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Zhang Guohua pointed out, Sichuan is a very important strategic location in our country, bearing a glorious and heavy task. The entire army and people of the province must further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness for war," further carry out the "support the army and love the people" activities, further study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, do a better job in revolution and industrial and agricultural production and other work, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and turn Sichuan Province into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Liang Xingchu, responsible person of the People's Liberation Army Chengdu Garrison and Vice Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting on behalf of all soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Sichuan. He warmly congratulated the birth of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee. He said, the great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle." We must wholeheartedly love, firmly support, actively help, and bravely defend the new-born revolutionary committee and be a strong backing for the revolutionary committee. We must resolutely expose and smash all the tricks of the class enemies to sabotage the revolutionary committee. We resolutely respond to the great call of the great commander Chairman Mao to "support the army and love the people," firmly support the leftist broad masses, further do a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work, strengthen military-civilian unity, and forever stand and fight together with the revolutionary people of the entire province.

Comrade Li Dachang, Vice Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary leading cadre, spoke at the meeting. He said, our great leader Chairman Mao always cares about the growth of revolutionary cadres and always cares for and guides us. At every critical moment of revolutionary development and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao always clearly explains the theory, line, policy, and direction of revolutionary struggle. When we make mistakes, Chairman Mao always patiently guides and encourages us to correct our mistakes, put down our burdens, and march lightly. Cadres who have made mistakes must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, strictly demand of themselves, correctly treat the masses, resolutely correct their mistakes, and bravely stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to achieve new merits for the people.

Comrades Liu Jieting and Zhang Xiqing, Vice Chairmen of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, also spoke at the celebration meeting. They hoped that the revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of the people of the entire province would firmly grasp the direction of struggle, unite all revolutionary forces that can be united, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, consolidate the great victories already achieved, develop the good situation, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Representatives of revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards spoke at the meeting. They said they would definitely remember Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forget class struggle," strengthen their vigilance against the enemy, purify and consolidate the class ranks, unite and win over allies, and launch an unceasing attack on the class enemies. They would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, criticize and repudiate revisionism, continue to consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. They would resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," further strengthen military-civilian unity. They would love, support, and defend the new-born revolutionary committee, be vigilant against and smash the evil plots of the class enemies to sabotage and overthrow the revolutionary committee. They would strengthen socialist labor discipline, complete the industrial and agricultural production tasks and other major tasks assigned by the state, and achieve a double harvest of revolution and production.

Comrades Tian Bao, Xu Chi, Deng Xingguo, Jiang Haiyun, Wang Henglin, Peng Jiatie, Zhang Sizhou, Feng Yude, Cai Wenbin, Yang Zhicheng, and Dan Kunrong, Vice Chairmen of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and comrades from the Chengdu Revolutionary Committee, the People's Liberation Army Chengdu Garrison, and the Chengdu Garrison Command attended the celebration meeting.

The meeting, in the midst of thunderous cheers and applause, adopted a telegram of respect to our most respected great leader Chairman Mao.

After the meeting, a grand parade was held. (With pictures)

    广大军民表示，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，牢牢掌握斗争大方向；区别两类不同性质的矛盾，加强敌情观念，始终把斗争矛头对准一小撮阶级敌人；爱护和支持革委会；增强军民之间的坚强团结，警惕右倾分裂主义；发展按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合和革命三结合，深入开展革命大批判；更好地完成工农业生产和各项基本建设任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    新华社成都一日电　在我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀和英明领导下，祖国西南传来了振奋人心的喜讯：四川省革命委员会在阶级斗争的急风暴雨中光荣诞生了。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！
    四川有七千万革命人民，是我们伟大社会主义祖国的大后方，处在十分重要的战略地位。四川省革命委员会的成立，是我国无产阶级文化大革命运动中的一件大事。它宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其代理人妄图在西南和四川复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋彻底破产，标志着四川的无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个崭新的阶段，给了国内外一切阶级敌人以沉重的打击。这个伟大的胜利，对正在乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的全国亿万军民，是一个极大的鼓舞。
    四川曾经是封建军阀、美帝国主义、国民党反动派血腥统治的一个要地。解放以来，四川人民紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，取得了巨大成就。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在西南和四川的代理人李井泉、廖志高、任白戈、黄新廷之流，代表国民党反动派的利益，代表帝国主义、修正主义、资产阶级和地富反坏右的利益，千方百计对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，疯狂推行反革命修正主义路线，妄想把四川变成复辟资本主义的独立王国。无产阶级同资产阶级，社会主义同资本主义，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，在四川一直进行着激烈的斗争。在无产阶级文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大走资派及其在西南和四川地区的代理人，勾结国民党反动派的残渣余孽，残酷镇压无产阶级革命派和革命群众，妄图挽回其覆灭的命运。
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，一直非常关怀四川的无产阶级文化大革命。每当斗争的关键时刻，毛主席都英明地作了极其重要的指示。毛主席的亲切关怀和伟大教导，给了四川省七千万革命人民以巨大的鼓舞和无穷的力量。广大工人、贫下中农、革命的红卫兵小将和革命干部，怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬“对反动派造反有理”的革命精神，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在西南和四川的代理人，发起了迅猛异常的进攻。他们沿着毛主席指引的胜利航向，英勇奋战，击退资产阶级反动路线的重重抵抗，夺得了四川无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    当前，四川省革命和生产形势空前大好，越来越好。广大人民群众活学活用毛主席著作的热情空前高涨，毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心，毛主席一系列最新指示进一步落实。全省七千万人民，精神焕发，斗志昂扬。他们遵循伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大教导，掀起了抓革命，促生产的新高潮。
    五月三十一日，四川省省会成都市，沉浸在盛大节日的气氛中。来自全省各条战线的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员五十万人，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，手执红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱对伟大领袖毛主席的颂歌，从四面八方汇集到市中心人民南路广场，隆重庆祝四川省革命委员会胜利诞生。

    在欢庆四川省革命委员会诞生的大喜日子里，从雪山草地到夔门三峡，从大巴山区到金沙江两岸，全省七千万革命人民，最衷心地祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”参加庆祝大会的人民解放军广大指战员，受到全场广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。人民解放军驻四川部队广大指战员，在无产阶级文化大革命中，热烈响应伟大统帅毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号令，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，积极帮助无产阶级革命派和革命群众落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，用伟大的毛泽东思想宣传群众、武装群众、组织群众，帮助他们增强无产阶级党性，反对资产阶级派性，有力地促进、巩固、发展了革命大联合和革命三结合，在“三支”“两军”工作中作出了巨大贡献，为四川的无产阶级文化大革命建立了不朽的功勋。在庆祝大会上，广大革命群众不断高呼：“向人民解放军学习！”“向人民解放军致敬！”“伟大的中国人民解放军万岁！”
    四川省革命委员会主任张国华同志在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说，四川省革命委员会的成立，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！他说，革命委员会的成立不是阶级斗争的结束，而是新的战斗的起点。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，放手发动群众，依靠群众，引导群众，团结一切可以团结的力量，组织浩浩荡荡的革命大军，继续向无产阶级的敌人发动猛烈进攻，稳、准、狠地打击阶级敌人。要坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大的走资派和他们的代理人李井泉、廖志高、任白戈、黄新廷之流揭深批透，斗倒斗臭，把一小撮隐藏的叛徒、特务、反革命分子挖出来，进一步巩固无产阶级专政。
    张国华同志说，我们要遵照毛主席的教导，加强革命委员会的建设，“实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”革命委员会要永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线。革命委员会要充分发动广大人民群众直接参加国家管理，强化无产阶级专政。要密切联系群众，经常听取群众意见，把革命委员会建设成为突出无产阶级政治，充满革命干劲，雷厉风行，精悍有力的战斗指挥部。
    张国华同志说，革命委员会成立以后，工作千头万绪，最根本的就是领导全省七千万革命人民，进一步活学活用毛泽东思想，把活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动推向新的高潮。要继续办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。要以毛泽东思想为武器，斗私批修，总结两年来无产阶级文化大革命的经验。要向无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部门合同志学习，学习他无限忠于人民，无限忠于党，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的崇高品质，促进全省革命人民的思想革命化。
    张国华同志说，为了更有力地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，全省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，要继续巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合。要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把一些跨行业的群众组织引向按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合的轨道，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上进一步团结起来。
    张国华同志说，毛主席最近又一次指出：“要相信百分之九十以上的干部是好的和比较好的。犯了错误的人，大多数是可以改的。”各革命群众组织，要进一步帮助更多的革命干部站出来。一切革命干部要正确对待群众，正确对待自己，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。
    张国华同志指出，四川是我国十分重要的战略要地，担负着光荣而繁重的任务。全省军民要进一步贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，进一步开展“拥军爱民”活动，进一步活学活用毛泽东思想，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，把革命和工农业生产等各项工作做得更好，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把四川省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    中国人民解放军成都部队负责人、四川省革命委员会副主任梁兴初同志，代表人民解放军驻四川部队全体指战员在大会上讲话，热烈祝贺四川省革命委员会光荣诞生。他说，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”对新生的革命委员会，我们一定要满腔热情地爱护，坚定不移地支持，积极诚恳地帮助，坚决勇敢地捍卫，誓作革命委员会的坚强后盾。对于阶级敌人破坏革命委员会的一切阴谋诡计，我们要坚决揭露，给以粉碎性的打击。我们坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，坚决支持左派广大群众，进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作，加强军民团结，永远同全省革命人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
