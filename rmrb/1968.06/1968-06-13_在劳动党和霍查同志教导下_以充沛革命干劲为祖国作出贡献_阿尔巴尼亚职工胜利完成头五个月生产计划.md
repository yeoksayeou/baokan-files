The heroic Albanian working class, inspired by the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania and the teachings of Comrade Enver Hoxha, has, with the abundant enthusiasm unleashed in the revolutionary movement, successfully completed and overfulfilled the production plan for the first five months of this year.

The workers on the front lines of the mining and geological exploration departments have overcome numerous difficulties to produce more crude oil, copper, and coal for the socialist motherland. In the first five months of this year, the crude oil production plan was completed at 102.5 percent, and asphalt at 109.7 percent. Oil workers have adopted new methods to increase production. Meanwhile, exploration workers are striving to discover new oil fields and natural gas. In the first five months of this year, copper miners nationwide exceeded the original plan by 4,800 tons of copper ore. Workers at the Nartanesh and Burqize chromium mines produced 3,700 tons of chromium ore above the plan. Coal miners at the Memaliaj mine exceeded the original plan by 1,500 tons of coal.

Workers in the chemical industry, to promote the intensification of agriculture and increase the yield per unit area of crops, especially grain crops, produced 4,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer and 1,500 tons of nitrogen fertilizer above the original plan in the first five months of this year, providing strong support for spring and summer planting. Alkali workers produced 3,500 tons of caustic soda and caustic alkali above the plan. The Durres Rubber Factory, which originally planned to produce 100 new products this year, has produced 90 new products in the first five months alone due to the launch of a technical innovation movement among the workers.

The power industry has also overfulfilled the production plan for the first five months of this year by 8 percent.

Workers in the machinery industry have made achievements in implementing self-reliance and reducing imports. They have responded to the calls of the Party of Labour and Comrade Enver Hoxha to launch technical innovation and rationalization movements, producing a large number of machines and agricultural tools for industrial and mining enterprises and agricultural cooperatives.

To meet the growing needs of industrial and agricultural construction and civilian construction, workers in the building materials industry produced 2.76 million more bricks and 2,000 tons of cement above the original plan in the first five months of this year. The production plans for industries such as forestry and wood processing have also been overfulfilled.

Workers in the light industry sector produced 697,000 meters of cotton cloth and 200,000 meters of woolen fabric above the original plan during this period to meet the growing needs of the broad masses of workers and peasants.

Many workers, while increasing production, also pay attention to saving raw materials, fuel, and electricity, reducing costs, and improving quality.

The workers of many state farms have responded to the Party's call, overcome numerous difficulties, and done a great deal of work. In the first five months of this year, they produced 5,500 more piculs of vegetables, 3,400 piculs of milk, and 1,500 piculs of meat compared to the same period last year.

In the first five months of this year, the freight volume of railways was completed at 108 percent, and the maritime transport volume at 122 percent.

The broad masses of commercial workers, following Comrade Enver Hoxha's teachings on "being the servants of the people" and "strengthening the worker-peasant alliance," have made remarkable achievements in expanding the commercial network in rural areas, especially in mountainous rural areas.

	Workers and technicians at the "Enver Hoxha" Machinery Factory in Tirana discuss a new technological innovation measure. This mass line working method has mobilized the enthusiasm of everyone, continuously improving the factory's production efficiency.
